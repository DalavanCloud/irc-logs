[12:10:40] ian_mac has joined #selenium
[12:12:56] simonstewart: Looks like the opera driver is choking on whatever we do to find elements using the "dom" locator
[12:13:17] jeichar has joined #selenium
[12:13:26] andreastt: It's choking because of some exception when using ecmascript service rather than ecmascript-debugger.

[13:00:25] dawagner: Dear chrome, why are you doing this to me? Why?
[13:00:34] simonstewart: "shits and giggles"
[13:00:37] simonstewart: ?
[13:02:47] simonstewart: andreastt I'm about to throw together something for authenticating users
[13:03:12] simonstewart: Do we want "driver.manage().authenticateAs(user, password)?
[13:03:58] andreastt: What would that authenticate?
[13:04:11] simonstewart: BASIC and DIGEST login dialogs
[13:04:27] simonstewart: Wondering whether there's something in the opera driver to handle that already
[13:04:34] andreastt: Nope.
[13:05:08] andreastt: There is support for managing dialogues in Scope, but I haven't implemented it yet.
[13:05:12] simonstewart: k
[13:05:39] andreastt: On internal builds we have a “auto-accept all security dialogues” option.
[13:05:56] simonstewart: That'd be useful for people testing sites with self-signed ssl certs
[13:07:18] andreastt: So you don't want a Security interface sitting in between manage and authenticate…?
[13:07:46] simonstewart: That's why I'm chatting here :)
[13:08:23] andreastt: I was trying to think of anything else related to security we want to be able to manipulate.
[13:08:24] simonstewart: Another option would be "driver.authenticateAs(user, pw)"
[13:08:34] simonstewart: SSL certs
[13:08:46] andreastt: If anything, putting it under manage() is better.
[13:08:50] simonstewart: k
[13:08:53] simonstewart: Manage for now
[13:09:01] andreastt: Marking it as @Beta?
[13:09:04] simonstewart: Yup
[13:09:07] andreastt: Great
[13:09:23] andreastt: So, while we're at it.  What about being able to create windows?
[13:09:53] andreastt: driver.window().create(), returning WebDriver, would be awesome. d-:
[13:09:54] simonstewart: What about being able to create new windows
[13:10:06] simonstewart: would that do a switchTo?
[13:10:33] andreastt: Yes, or switchTo().new() or something.
[13:11:08] andreastt: The way we currently advise testers to create new windows is driver.getScopeServices().getWindowHandler().createWindow();
[13:11:46] simonstewart: Not: executeScript('window.openWindow()')
[13:11:49] simonstewart: ?
[13:12:02] hxmws has joined #selenium
[13:12:54] Parabola: Why would you create a new window?
[13:13:26] andreastt: simonstewart: Doesn't work in Opera.
[13:13:35] andreastt: simonstewart: Besides, it'd be safer to do it through Scope.
[13:13:47] hxmws: Hi All, trying to understand browsermob-proxy with selenium grid. Does browsermob-proxy need to be running on the node? or can this run on the hub and then send requests on
[13:13:48] andreastt: Parabola: Because we want to emulate a user's actions.
[13:13:53] andreastt: Parabola: Besides, we're testing a browser.
[13:14:16] andreastt: A user frequently opens new tabs
[13:17:11] Parabola: fair enough :)
[13:19:56] simonstewart: andreastt: to be fair, I'm not convinced it'd work in Firefox now :)
[13:21:24] simonstewart: Must stop typing "rog" instead of "org"
[13:21:28] simonstewart: Or, as I almost typed
[13:21:36] simonstewart: Must stop typing "rog" instead of "rog"
[13:21:39] simonstewart: Which makes no sense
[13:21:43] simonstewart: But proves the point
[13:22:07] adamgoucher: ian_mac: ya. that seems to the be consensus -- of course then i would need to understand branches :D

[13:22:25] simonstewart: I'm amazed they let me out in public

[13:28:47] simonstewart: Which seems to be the best home for this, right?
[13:28:49] andreastt: But it's not an alert box.

[13:29:33] simonstewart: Depends on the browser :)

[13:49:49] Parabola: it works by following their motto, be better than IE, but crappier than Chrome
[13:49:52] Parabola: ..does that help?
[13:50:09] simonstewart: sure
[13:50:13] simonstewart: thanks
[13:50:15] simonstewart: :)
[13:50:31] Parabola: I forgot to mention alienate your users and devs by releasing a new version every 2 weeks
[13:50:36] Parabola: so everyone has to test on 30 versions
[13:50:51] Parabola: glad I could be of use :P
[13:51:52] hxmws: testingb0t, thanks so one installation only of browsermob proxy is required
[13:52:16] hxmws: testingb0t, all tests can pass through that one proxy
[13:52:39] testingb0t: hxmws: yes, that will work
[13:53:58] hxmws: testingb0t, cool thanks. I guess that therefore means you could setup a proxy and take advantage of selenium infrastructures such as testingbot and saucelabs
[13:54:15] hxmws: but still obtain the performance metrics
[13:55:16] testingb0t: hxmws: yes, we (testingbot) actually provide a per user browsermob proxy as well: http://testingbot.com/support/other/proxy
[13:55:57] hxmws: testingb0t, cool! i'll be sure to take a look :-)

[14:12:04] adamgoucher: cgoldberg: nope. havent started. that the big thing on my list today
[14:16:20] cgoldberg: adamgoucher, i'm eventually going to write something similar.. but haven't done anything yet.. basically I'm thinking:  json.load() the har into a python object.. then create methods to pull interesting stats and data from it
[14:17:12] adamgoucher: ya. thats kinda i think the approach to be taken. of course, what 'interesting' means will vary greatly
[14:17:46] cgoldberg: adamgoucher, a hook to generate a waterfall (via harviewer) would be cool also
[14:18:47] adamgoucher: but secondary to getting interesting stuff
[14:19:12] cgoldberg: adamgoucher, I'm wondering if it can be kept generic enough to create a package/module from...  `harparser` or something.  if so, I can probably contribute

[14:27:56] simonstewart: Moved the proxy to littleproxy

[14:28:30] bsilverberg has joined #selenium
[14:28:34] simonstewart: The main reason we still have jetty5 is that jetty6 changed the way the handlers worked
[14:28:43] simonstewart: and no-one understood the proxy well enough to make the move
[14:28:57] simonstewart: (patrick tells me the bottlebneck was the ssl proxying)

[16:37:05] Dude-X: interesting thing i've discovered with 2.23 when upgraded from 2.17
[16:37:14] Dude-X: some of the tests skipped commands to click
[16:37:41] Dude-X: but the commands still succeed regardless of not clicking, seems like looking up an element activated it
[16:38:29] simonstewart: I'm not entirely sure what you just said there....
[16:38:56] Dude-X: oh yeah that is confusing, 2.23 exposed bugs in tests
[16:39:12] lukeis: bugs in your tests.. not selenium right? ;)
[16:39:16] Dude-X: tests would pass in 2.17 but should have failed because it's not doing some necessary steps
[16:39:42] Dude-X: both tests and selenium have bugs
[16:39:54] Dude-X: at least where 2.17 is concerned.
[16:41:15] Dude-X: as an example, I have a test that would open an overlay, then it's suppose to cick on a button to open another overlay, then check a few checkboxes, click a button, then close the overlay
[16:41:30] Dude-X: the 'suppose to' step was not in the test. in 2.17 this would pass
[16:41:45] simonstewart: But the problems are fixed with 2.23 (on the selenium side)?
[16:42:07] Dude-X: yes!
[16:42:34] Dude-X: but alert handling might be flaky, it seems to throw after a period of time
[16:42:42] simonstewart: Furrfu
[16:42:58] simonstewart: There should be something in ExpectedConditions to help work with that

[16:46:57] dawagner: jarib: I don't know much about capybara, but I assume the answer to https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/issues/690#issuecomment-6359102 is to use something like a WebDriverWait, or for capybara to somehow make click synchronous (given WebDriver isn't going to)...
[16:52:14] Dude-X: simonstewart: i would have an atomic function that would active an alert box, then i call alert.accept()
[16:52:27] Dude-X: worked fine before, regardless of time passed
[16:53:32] Dude-X: with 2.17, it seems that finding an element would activate that element. as an example iterating through the options of a dropdown box would cause it to open and close repeatedly if it has many options
[16:54:58] simonstewart: finding shouldn't activate an element
[16:55:05] simonstewart: Performing an action on it will
[16:55:19] simonstewart: Dude-X: do you have a test case you could share?
[16:55:48] Dude-X: well, maybe jquery does something weird, but in two different webapps on the project, tests would pass on 2.17, but fail on 2.23 because the elements were actually invisible
[16:55:58] simonstewart: how odd
[16:56:35] Dude-X: indeed. I am glad that I finally upgraded to 2.23 ( i would test every release but not spend the time investigating why tests would fail)

[19:15:52] eanxgeek: davehunt: ok I think that may be what I'm missing, I've done setup.py register, but not sdist or upload
[19:16:17] davehunt: eanxgeek: http://guide.python-distribute.org/creation.html
[19:16:21] davehunt: that's what I used
[19:17:48] davehunt|away: bbl
[19:17:54] eanxgeek: davehunt|away: thanks 
[19:26:39] cgoldberg: eanxgeek, yup register, sdist, sdist upload
[19:27:00] eanxgeek: cgoldberg: that's exactly it, I missed the sdist 
[19:27:04] eanxgeek: errr
[19:27:07] *eanxgeek kicks self
[19:33:13] adamgoucher: cgoldberg AutomatedTester - https://github.com/adamgoucher/HARPy i think might be almost at a usable state
[19:43:51] jimevans: I get that many in the watir community consider the IE driver inferior to their beloved classic solution, but is it really true that nobody in that community cares enough to work on fixing it?
[19:46:15] Dude-X: how many ruby users would know C++  / .net?
[19:46:34] jimevans: Dude-X: i honestly don't give a damn.
[19:47:03] Dude-X: what are you reading that you get many vocal complaints?
[19:47:06] lukeis: you can tell them if their beloved classic works so much better... then just use that instead :)
[19:47:14] jimevans: i'm pissed off and tired of the sniping and maligning of our (my) code with no constructive engagement as to how to make it better.
[19:48:09] jimevans: Dude-X: i lurk on the watir-general mailing list. i pop in and browse the archives of the wtr-development list. 
[19:48:16] *adamgoucher points out that this is the interenet. it runs on sniping and lack of constructive engagement. oh. and porn...
[19:49:01] Dude-X: does watir use selenium 100% now?
[19:49:02] jimevans: there are a number of highly vocal and influential members of the watir community that have a very low opinion of the ie driver, especially as compared to the classic watir library.
[19:49:07] jimevans: but i'm not going to name names.
[19:49:18] jimevans: Dude-X: no.
[19:49:43] Dude-X: if the classic library was much better, then they should have stuck with it...
[19:49:51] jimevans: jarib's watir-webdriver is used by lots of people, and there's a push to make that the implementation in watir 4.0
[19:50:28] jimevans: but the current 3.x branch uses the classic approach.
[19:50:29] Dude-X: ah i see now
[19:50:57] jimevans: where "classic" == "directly driving the browser using the COM interfaces"
[19:51:12] Dude-X: is that reliable?
[19:51:14] Dude-X: safe?
[19:51:20] jimevans: within limits. 
[19:51:37] jimevans: under the covers, that's what the IE driver does too, we just use C++ instead of Ruby.
[19:51:49] t0mcat has joined #selenium
[19:51:57] jimevans: and we rely more on javascript than the watir library does.
[19:51:58] t0mcat: if an element has two classes will it match either?
[19:51:59] lukeis: first automation tool i ever used was PAMIE (python automated module for IE)... python directly call COM ;)
[19:52:07] t0mcat: like <div class="foo bar"></div>
[19:52:13] Dude-X: t0mcat: how you're locating it?
[19:52:17] t0mcat: by class name
[19:52:28] t0mcat: find_element_by_class_name("foo")
[19:52:37] t0mcat: will that find it, or do I need to do "foo bar"?
[19:52:38] jimevans: oh, and native events, too. that's the biggest difference, and when i drill down on complaints is the biggest source of their disdain.
[19:52:38] Dude-X: classname must match one class name
[19:52:47] Dude-X: so i think i's fine
[19:52:49] t0mcat: word
[19:52:51] t0mcat: ty
[19:54:05] jimevans: but what really pisses me off is the attitude of saying "your code sucks", and me saying "o
[19:54:27] jimevans: "i'd love to make it better. tell me how to improve it. i can't fix 'sucks'"
[19:54:35] jimevans: and getting nothing in return.

[19:54:46] *lukeis thinks jimevans should ignore the watir lists and just wait for reproducible bugs in the issues list
[19:55:05] jimevans: (of course that pisses me off about a small subset of selenium users too, but that's another story)
[19:55:10] Dude-X: people feel because they're anonymous on the internet that they can be bigger douchebags
[19:55:31] *lukeis likes to just be the bigger douchebag
[19:55:38] lukeis: oh wait ;)
[19:55:44] jimevans: except these vocal people *aren't* anonymous. for the most part, they're prominent, and well-known.
[19:56:02] Dude-X: and they have the know-how to fix it?
[19:56:18] jimevans: again, i don't give a damn.
[19:56:48] jimevans: don't bitch about how horrible something is if you have no intention of constructively engaging in how to improve it.
[19:57:18] jimevans: i'm not asking someone else to do the work, but at least meet me halfway.
[19:57:19] lukeis: IE sucks... i have no way to help there ;) ... IE Driver on the other hand gets what I want done...
[19:58:12] jimevans: anyway, now that i've worked myself into a decent frenzy, i can head to the airport for the exercise in efficiency that is the U.S. air travel system.
[19:58:24] jimevans: later, guys.
[19:58:24] Dude-X: heh
[19:58:26] jimevans has left #selenium
[19:58:30] Dude-X: godspeed jim
[19:58:44] Dude-X: i hardly fly within the US
[19:58:50] Dude-X: but last time i did, it was a giant suckfest
[19:59:14] lukeis: jfk is always a beast... other 'smaller' airports are pretty good
[19:59:16] Dude-X: for whatever reason flying internationally is generally not so bad
[19:59:29] Dude-X: yeah I dislike JFK, but LGA is worse

[20:00:15] lukeis: i shouldn't complain much... sfo is actually pretty easy... but i still prefer oak cause it's much easier
[20:00:57] t0mcat: hey so when you've got a webelement and you want to use xpath within it, do you use relative xpath?
[20:01:18] lukeis: yes
[20:01:21] t0mcat: k
[20:01:23] lukeis: "./"
[20:01:27] t0mcat: ?
[20:01:31] t0mcat: oh
[20:01:33] t0mcat: instead of //
[20:01:45] Dude-X: element.findElement('./div/div/guisarme/glave')
[20:01:49] t0mcat: word
[20:01:50] lukeis: yes... "//" specifies start of the doc

[22:44:32] GomoX: So I get a bunch of windows
[22:45:06] Dude-X: what version, langauge binding, etc
[22:45:21] GomoX: I tried specifying the path to firefox-bin as suggested by a SO page, but no difference
[22:45:24] GomoX: I'm using PHPUnit
[22:45:38] Dude-X: oh can't help you there

[22:52:52] GomoX: The folder to store screenshots did not exist

[22:53:00] GomoX: :-S
