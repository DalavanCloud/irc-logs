[02:00:24] klrmn: both firefox and chrome seem to have a modal dialog when you try to leave some pages with the title "Confirm Navigation" and options "Stay on this Page" or "Leave this Page". can anyone give me a pointer about how to handle this with the ruby / python clients?
[02:01:43] klrmn: i tried using @current_page.confirm(true), but i still got "Modal dialog present" errors

[21:28:17] Swadq: Ah alright :p if I don't know, I can just move it to usr/bin right?
[21:29:44] stephend_: guessing so, but I honestly don't know

[23:11:37] wietze has joined #selenium
[23:12:24] wietze: Im probably asking a muchasked question, but Im running selenium server and I want to use some kind of loop in my testcase; I am wondering how to go on about this
[23:12:59] DarkRift: what kind of loop
[23:14:31] friskd has joined #selenium
[23:14:34] wietze: a dowhile/for
[23:20:40] DarkRift: yeah but what's the goal of that loop
[23:21:01] DarkRift: I don't see the problem of a while loop in a test case
[23:21:10] DarkRift: that's why I'm still wondering what's the question is all about
[23:24:05] wietze: the goal of the loop is, that if I want something to be done repetetively for a certain amount of times, I dont want to copy paste it that amount of times
[23:24:59] wietze: in the selenium IDE, there is a plugin that covers this
[23:25:09] wietze: but this does not seem to work on the standalone
[23:30:32] DarkRift: what about a plain simple while loop in the language of your test code ?
[23:30:47] DarkRift: there is no "loop" command
[23:31:02] DarkRift: that's is in fact useless because each languages provides loop
[23:32:16] wietze: you're most probably right
[23:33:43] DarkRift: in which language do you write your tests ?
[23:33:44] OtherJakeSays_ has joined #selenium
[23:34:06] DarkRift: the only exception is HTML tests with selenium IDE and that's why there is a plugin to cover that case
[23:37:34] DarkRift: html is not a programming language anyway but a markup language only used for presentation
[23:40:40] wietze: oh, im totally noob with this stuff
[23:40:46] wietze: the tests are made using selenium ide
[23:40:58] wietze: and I want to `use' those using the testrunner
[23:41:54] wietze: but I seem to have found a nice solution
[23:42:08] wietze: by extending the user-extensions.js with the javascript functions
[23:51:46] DarkRift: ah so you are using selenium ide
[23:52:09] DarkRift: I thought you used it only to create them but modified them after
