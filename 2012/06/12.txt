[13:32:47] foolx: Hi Guys! Quick Question: how can i save a locator 'By.id(identifierString)' as a value itself? I use a parameter class where i save each element and the elementLocator (id, cssSelector, xpath). How can i use this for selecting? 
[13:37:15] foolx: For Example: I have a locator like this: By.id(Value). Now i want to use my saved values -> By.id(registerParameter.getRegisterButton()). But now i also want to use a variable to decide if By.id or By.name should be used. -> By.registerParameter.gerRegisterButtonLocator()(registerParameter.getRegisterButton()) isn't valid, so... how can i save/use my values to decide which BY locator should 
[13:37:15] foolx: be used?

[13:55:19] hourback has left #selenium
[13:55:21] skiphuffman_: foolx, Well, that depends on your development language.
[13:55:33] foolx: java ;)
[13:56:16] llaskin1: foolx you are making this overly complicated
[13:56:22] llaskin1: imho
[13:56:47] foolx: i like the sound of this ;)
[13:56:51] skiphuffman_: for me I do a lot of these sort of things:  ElementObj = driver.find_element_by_id(ElementID)
[13:57:05] llaskin1: you can redefine By Class if youw ant
[13:57:08] llaskin1: but i don't see the point...
[13:57:22] skiphuffman_: Then I can do this:  ElementObj.get_attribute('value')
[13:57:50] skiphuffman_: or this: ElementObj.click()
[13:58:04] skiphuffman_: But I work in python.
[13:58:23] foolx: the problem is, we don't always have the same objects for our page. Sometimes they all have to be identified by name, other times by id. I wanted to save not just the element, but also the identifier so i can use the same code for both
[13:58:53] skiphuffman_: foolx, I use what I call an "Identity normalization" file.
[13:59:03] foolx: skiphuffman: but how can you say driver.find_element_by_ + SAVED VALUE + (ElementID)
[13:59:21] skiphuffman_: I put all the different identifiers in there, and return element objects that can be used by any of my functions.
[13:59:36] skiphuffman_: That way my functions don't need to know HOW the element is identified, just WHAT it can do.
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jun 12 14:00:06 2012]
[14:00:06] skiphuffman_: foolx, I don't think you easily can do that. 
[14:00:32] skiphuffman_: Because the exact syntax for the different connection types varies.
[14:02:58] skiphuffman_: foolx,  I use this method to deal with different identification types:  https://gist.github.com/2917360
[14:02:58] foolx: that does not sound fine ;(
[14:04:09] foolx: I begin to think, that it could be easier to simple try using cssSelector everywhere ;)
[14:05:27] skiphuffman_: css is pretty much your best first choice.
[14:05:47] skiphuffman_: until you run into something where it doesn't work.
[14:05:55] skiphuffman_: Take a look at the Gist I linked above.
[14:06:12] skiphuffman_: I included two examples from my "Identity Normalization" file.
[14:07:06] foolx: thanks, i will take a look into that ;)
[14:07:36] llaskin1: foolx: i always use CSS as my first choice...
[14:07:41] skiphuffman_: If I provide the "Get_Element_Object" with an Element from the "Identity Normalization" it will always give me an element object that I can work with in a consistent fashion.
[14:08:50] skiphuffman_: Then when my developers redefine some element, I can just change the entry in the identity normalization and everything keeps working.
[14:13:49] foolx: sounds good, but i think that will be a little bit more work to implement that ;) So for now i will try to change everything to CSS ;)

[14:14:59] skiphuffman_: It is more work to start with.  But for me at least it has lead to both more maintainable code and code that I can more easily teach others to add to.

[14:33:23] skiphuffman_: 25k +
[14:33:54] skiphuffman_: Of course "useful" lines is somewhat less than that.

[14:35:44] llaskin1: is that how you spell it?
[14:35:45] llaskin1: svelt?
[14:35:50] bobsporren: svelte, i think
[14:36:01] cgoldberg: hah i dunno
[14:36:14] skiphuffman_: That 25k is 21k written my old "bad" way and about 4k written my new "less bad" way.
[14:36:50] skiphuffman_: If I refactored the 21k it would probably be 3k-4k in my new style.
[14:37:03] cgoldberg: skiphuffman_, is that just framework code.. or also tests?
[14:37:04] skiphuffman_: Page Object Model is smaller and clearer.
[14:37:09] skiphuffman_: Includes tests.

[14:39:19] cgoldberg: do you guys couple your tests with framework?  just wondering how other people package things.
[14:39:27] skiphuffman_: (Which I define as Robot Framework Suite files and test data)
[14:39:48] skiphuffman_: Ack.  Drop another 10k from that total for some logs I had sitting in there.
[14:40:01] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[14:40:03] skiphuffman_: So really, right around 10k-13k
[14:40:25] cgoldberg: I have a separate repo for framework.. and then tests are coupled with application/project code of AUT... with framework as a dependency.
[14:41:03] skiphuffman_: I consider my framework everything up to what I call an "Agent"  which is a series of steps to perform a type of action on my system under test.
[14:41:19] skiphuffman_: Suite files and Data sit on top of that.
[14:41:52] skiphuffman_: Basically I consider my Python and Selenium code to be "Framework" and my data and management code to me "Tests".
[14:42:37] skiphuffman_: We don't measure things by kloc around here, which is why I got the numbers wrong at first.
[14:43:23] cgoldberg: skiphuffman_, I don't usually care about LOC, but ohloh gives pretty graphs and metrics :)  (if your framework is open source)
[14:43:57] xtian_ has joined #selenium
[14:45:33] skiphuffman_: Our framework is Company Work Product.  Also stuffed full of specific connections to our stuff, so not open source.

[14:47:38] cgoldberg: skiphuffman_, we open sourced ours.. it's been nice.

[16:23:14] llaskin1: so i keep a white board next to my desk
[16:23:21] llaskin1: and on there, i update a number whenever automation finds a bug
[16:23:29] llaskin1: automation has been fully running for 12 days
[16:23:31] llaskin1: and has found 33bugs
[16:23:51] llaskin1: the biggest reason behind it, there is a dev who doesn't value automation and thinks its a waste of time
[16:24:01] llaskin1: so everytime I update that number, its like a big middle finger right at him
[16:26:38] lukeis: llaskin1: nice! you should get a big flat screen and have it constantly show the latest build status (# of failing tests, time green or red, who broke the build, etc.) they are fun to have ;)
[16:28:47] lukeis: so, looks like google groups has a tagging feature... should we enable that on Se Users list?
[16:31:06] llaskin1: i do that too:)
[16:31:13] lukeis: i don't know the worst that could happen... so enabling it ;)

[17:35:02] llaskin1: without pasting our entire code base:-P
[17:35:34] lukeis: and quick dirty workaround for you of course is execute_script("arguments[0].value = arguments[1]", element, "The big & fat cat")

[18:00:10] Dude-X: that's all I need!
[18:00:16] Dude-X: err no it's not
[18:00:28] Dude-X: the element is always there so i need to check if it's displayed
[18:00:31] lukeis: so.... what are you trying to do?
[18:00:54] lukeis: there's an expected condition for that :)
[18:01:01] Dude-X: i think i read somewhere that when a loading spinner thingie appears, and you use wait for thing to appear
[18:01:35] lukeis: you can also wait for things to disappear (like a loading spinner)
[18:01:45] lukeis: invisibilityOf
[18:01:49] Dude-X: you should do a wait for ElementYouWant.isDisplayed == true && loadingSpinneDisappears
[18:02:19] Dude-X: i am trying to write a compound statement like this
[18:02:46] llaskin1: luke: we are using tokenfields
[18:02:56] llaskin1: but where to find a tokenfield in the wild, i have no clue
[18:03:23] Dude-X: you know i guess it's safe to assume that the element will always be on the page in this case
[18:03:46] Dude-X: so i can just simply do element.isDisplayed && !loadingElement.isDisplayed()
[18:06:13] lukeis: sure... but I would probably do... WebElement el = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By....));   wait.until(ExpectedConditions.invisibilityOfElementLocated(By....));
[18:06:30] lukeis: the latter being the loading guy
[18:06:42] Dude-X: i tried that and i get issues
[18:06:50] Dude-X: also it's slower too
[18:07:11] Dude-X: someone from mozilla suggested an &&
[18:07:36] *lukeis never listens to those mozillians ;)
[18:09:45] Dude-X: anyway i'm crafting a custom expected condtion that will test both in an and statemnet to see if it's faster/more reliable
[18:09:48] Dude-X: hopefully faster
[18:11:25] skiphuffman_ has joined #selenium
[18:12:28] lukeis: ah, that'll work... most of my speed issues in my tests are related to the actual app ;) not the automation... so I guess I don't tend to try to optimize it all the way like that
[18:13:19] Dude-X: well, for the most part, things are fast
[18:13:30] Dude-X: when a wait stalls for a long time, it's not a good locator

[19:54:54] jimevans: and your standards mean nothing.
[19:55:06] santiycr: damn IE, I think won't fix is reasonable 
[19:55:07] ebass: lets not bring my standards into this.

[19:57:01] ebass: jimevans: correct me if I am wrong but dont most of the "WebDrivers" use JavaScript under the covers
[19:57:36] jimevans: most do, but when it makes a big difference in performance (as in the IE driver), it makes sense to optimize by not, when appropriate.
[19:57:44] jleyba: ebass: Yes, all but htmlunit

[20:00:05] ebass: yea, I was looking @ the ChromeDriver code last week and thats there I found some substantial Javascript for finding elements
[20:00:34] baijum has joined #selenium
[20:00:35] jleyba: Yes, ChromeDriver uses the atoms library for find elements.  Keeps the behavior consistent across drivers
[20:01:17] jimevans: ebass: IE uses the atoms also, but at a huge performance cost.
[20:01:26] ebass: is there a program i run to make those atoms readable?

[20:03:08] stephend: didn't help that our Jenkins upgrade got botched, twice, and I had to roll back
[20:03:24] ebass: I think IE9 is pretty slick looking and i like that MS has finally integrated some useful developer tools into it
[20:03:33] jleyba: jimevans: is performance really that big of a deal for an automation tool?  I'd think consistent, reliable behavior is more important
[20:03:48] lukeis: looks like the trio wasn't meant to be... santiycr we can do lunch ;) 
[20:04:09] santiycr: :)
[20:05:32] ebass: jleyba: i think it does matter somewhat
[20:05:52] jimevans: jleyba: i tend to agree, but people really seem to be up in arms about how slow the IE driver is.
[20:06:04] ebass: our automation suite went from taking about an hour's worth of RC tests to over 3 hours when I switched to WebDriver

[20:09:03] santiycr: we can do it close to where you are
[20:09:03] ebass: my pure webdriver tests were much faster
[20:09:11] ebass: but the webdriverbackedselenium ones were the worst
[20:09:31] jleyba: webdriverbackedselenium does a ton of js execution
[20:09:38] ebass: it sure does
[20:09:40] jleyba: through webdriver's executeScript, which is dead slow
[20:09:41] ebass: its gross to watch
[20:09:51] jleyba: how optimized are your tests?
[20:10:03] santiycr: ebass: tell me about it
[20:10:06] jleyba: do you do all of your setup through the UI or using backend hooks?
[20:10:14] santiycr: the JSONWP dump is ridiculous 
[20:10:41] jleyba: santiycr: wouldn't be so bad if people didn't rely on explicit waits so much
[20:10:43] ebass: im not sure what you mean jleyba
[20:11:05] ebass: I was testing an analytics and reporting UI
[20:11:32] santiycr: jleyba: true, finding elements is the painful part
[20:12:03] ebass: it was data validation to make sure our services were working and the ajax calls were being translated to the page correctly
[20:12:07] santiycr: we could do better, by reading the selector client side and transforming it, though it may break some tests
[20:12:54] jleyba: ebass: could you use javascript unit tests for the logic that interprets the data returned by ajax?
[20:13:02] jleyba: santiycr: what do you mean?
[20:13:48] ebass: that was my recommendation when we started seeing the performance problems when migrating to webdriver
[20:14:07] jleyba: your tests would be far faster and far more focused
[20:14:19] santiycr: jleyba: for most interactions, it sends the whole se1 js finding element logic through the wire + the locator needed
[20:14:49] ebass: like i said...GROSS!
[20:14:50] ebass: hehehe
[20:14:58] santiycr: while it could avoid that by reading the locator, figuring out if there's a WD alternative, then just letting WD handle it
[20:15:09] jleyba: santiycr: ah...yeah...selenium.click(locator) becomes findElement(locator).click
[20:15:11] ebass: i thought i did something wrong the first time I saw the console of the WebDriver remote
[20:15:32] santiycr: convert  "click('id=bleh')" to "findElement(By.ID, "bleh").click()"
[20:15:34] jleyba: I thought Simon had implemented the server-side WDBS, which should alleviate that
[20:15:34] lukeis: and that translation code has already been written...
[20:15:50] lukeis: not in selenium code though
[20:16:06] santiycr: yeah, that's why I didn't go for making that change
[20:16:24] jleyba: Oh, Simon did the server-side Se-backed-WD?  Not the other way arounmd?
[20:16:25] santiycr: server side conversion is a lot better
[20:16:38] santiycr: he did both
[20:16:51] santiycr: though, server side WD-backed-Se is hard to impelement
[20:17:01] santiycr: at least in Sauce and probably grid
[20:17:21] santiycr: as it requires two separate sessions to represent the same node
[20:17:43] jleyba: I never use grid, so I know nothing about the architecture
[20:18:04] santiycr: IIRC, it's something like:
[20:18:13] santiycr: we request: get me a se2 session
[20:18:17] santiycr: s/we/WD
[20:18:36] santiycr: then SeRC request: give me a new session that is plugged to this other session
[20:19:15] santiycr: then you have two public sessions pointing to the same selenium server instance and internal session
[20:21:09] jleyba: ew
[20:21:36] ebass: lol
[20:21:41] ebass: u said what i was thinking.
[20:21:55] ebass: im not sure it needs to be that complex does it?
[20:22:04] *santiycr hopes simon could confirm this
[20:22:05] jleyba: Well, as soon as we figure out how to distribute the SafariDriver, we should slap a big fat deprecated tag on SeRC
[20:22:20] ebass: lol
[20:22:23] santiycr: oh yeah, big time!
[20:22:24] ebass: not sure i agree
[20:22:38] ebass: im not a big fan of it
[20:22:49] santiycr: well, we shouldn't kill it, but we should be louder telling people to move on
[20:23:10] jleyba: ebass: we don't have anyone contributing to SeRC.  We only touch it when we have to, and there's a lot of griping when we do
[20:23:10] ebass: but it was very hard to get buy in to move away from it with the performance problems we saw from a simple switch to a webdriver backed instance
[20:23:18] ebass: jleyba: i know
[20:23:33] lukeis: here's the code we should put in... convert the sel.click(....) to driver.findElement(....).click();   https://github.com/Ardesco/Ebselen/blob/master/ebselen-core/src/main/java/com/lazerycode/ebselen/handlers/LocatorHandler.java
[20:23:41] ebass: i could tell when i  couldnt download the newest releases because they werent working right.
[20:23:49] jimevans: seriously, though, the message has been "webdriver is the future, you should move to it" FOR MORE THAN A YEAR!
[20:24:09] jleyba: lukeis: but that's two RPCs for one SeRC RPC
[20:24:45] lukeis: yup... so, which is faster though, one RPC with massive JS or two WD ones?
[20:24:52] jimevans: how much more notice do people need before a deprecation label?
[20:25:08] jimevans: which, incidentally, gives them even *more* time to migrate.
[20:25:25] santiycr: lukeis: that varies depending on connectivity
[20:25:46] mltolun has joined #selenium
[20:26:31] lukeis: i wasn't even thinking of that... just the pure code execution of the JS being sent will slow it enough ;)
[20:27:32] santiycr: I don't see why it would be 2 RPC per each se RPC
[20:27:54] lukeis: sel.click(...)  is one... driver.findElement(...).click()  <- dos
[20:28:04] santiycr: I believe that's how it is now as well
[20:28:18] lukeis: not what WDBackedSe does
[20:28:23] jleyba: santiycr: that's just the case of se.click() - assuming you're not using server-side WDBS
[20:28:24] santiycr: oh, ok
[20:28:50] santiycr: thought is was converted to findEelemtn(by.hugejs, "â€¦") then e.click()
[20:30:05] santiycr: well, server side is the way to go anyways

[21:47:18] aparna175: Hello 
[21:49:17] aparna175: need help with chrome driver
[21:49:38] aparna175: is any one here? 
[21:49:45] jimevans: :ask
[21:49:45] selbot2: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[21:50:47] aparna175: rt... so much for being poliet.. the question: How to use chrome extension when opening chrome browser on a node.
[21:50:59] stockton has joined #selenium
[21:51:01] aparna175:          object[] _chromecap = { "--start-maximized", @"--load-extension= WebCapture.crx" }; 
[21:51:10] aparna175: when i use this i get an error manifest file missing on my node
[21:51:58] aparna175: also, does anyone know the prot that needs to be open for this chat session to work 
[21:52:05] aparna175: port*
[21:52:28] jimevans: so it looks like you're using c#, yes?
[21:52:33] aparna175: yes
[21:53:27] jimevans: you should probably be using ChromeOptions here instead of capabilities directly.
[21:54:21] jimevans: assuming, of course, that you're using the ChromeDriver class and not the RemoteWebDriver class.
[21:57:53] jleyba: jimevans: You can use ChromeOptions with DesiredCapabilities
[21:58:32] jleyba: DesiredCapabilities caps = DesiredCapabilities.chrome();
[21:58:42] jimevans: jleyba: he's using .net.
[21:58:43] jleyba: caps.setCapability(ChromeOptions.CAPABILITY, new ChromeOptions())
[21:58:50] jleyba: Oh, well that's unfortunate :)
[21:59:01] jimevans: but that might still work.
[21:59:15] lukeis: i put this on sehq: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html#using-chromeoptions
[21:59:20] lukeis: but no c# example

[22:00:37] jherm: Is chromedriver broken on server 2.23.1? I get an exception every time I try to start a new session with Chrome, I'm on OS X
[22:00:41] varialus has joined #selenium
[22:00:56] lukeis: not broken... 
[22:01:01] lukeis: are you using maven?
[22:01:07] lukeis: (and opera)
[22:01:07] jleyba: jherm: It worked for me earlier this morning with 2.23.0.  AFAIK there's no chrome differences in 2.23.1
[22:01:27] jherm: Soâ€¦ I'm actually using the perl client. Selenium::Remote::Driver
[22:01:45] jleyba: the java server is fine
[22:02:05] jleyba: you'll have to talk to the maintainer of the perl bindings - they aren't maintained by the Se project
[22:02:38] jherm: Right. It looks like it's a slowly dying project â€” I'll try to get a chrome session running with a different language binding and see what it sends to the server
[22:09:57] jimevans: jleyba: FYI, similar code to your java code should work with the .NET bindings too.
[22:11:05] lukeis: jleyba: why didn't you make the .toCapabilities() method public? ... would have been nicer (and like python) to do it that way :) (one less line of code)
[22:11:48] jleyba: lukeis: Code was provided by kkania.  Feel free to expose it
[22:12:04] lukeis: ok :)
[22:12:28] jimevans: i didn't for .NET because I want people moving away from raw capability manipulation in the .NET bindings.
[22:12:50] jleyba: lukeis: ^ we should probably do that in java too
[22:13:29] jleyba: lukeis: maybe add a DesiredCapabilities merge(DesiredCapabilities dc)?
[22:14:20] lukeis: what did i just sign up for? ;)

[23:05:36] ttk23: Greetings!  Has anyone run into issues where setting firefox UserAgent via WebDriver causes script to hang? Using: Python, Firefox WebDriver, BrowserMobProxy-Py
[23:06:41] ttk23: (+ selenium==2.23) 
[23:07:11] *lukeis doesn't set the userAgent string... i just use the appropriate browser :) (kinda the point of webdriver)
[23:07:25] ttk23: ya, true. 
[23:08:16] ttk23: it is a temp (read: lazy) approach, but given the amount of time I'm spending on it should prob just set it up for real.  
[23:11:10] lukeis: plus the only thing user agent does is trick your webserver which may be doing browser specific things to return the content it would for the other browser... which will likely break, since, you know, it's a different browser :)
[23:12:52] ttk23: true.  just figured I could get an approximation of browser's performance.timing by setting headless virtual display to mobile w/h and fake the UA.  =\
[23:15:01] lukeis: would be better to use something like htmlunit or other to see what the page weight / number of requests a page makes (I think there may be libraries out there to help with that too... i haven't looked into one yet)
[23:15:30] lukeis: (there is an htmlunitdriver)
[23:15:48] lukeis: but that would be harder to get the info you want
[23:16:50] stackedsax has joined #selenium

[23:18:18] ttk23: concerned that'll skew accuracy in js times
[23:19:16] ttk23: i think your main point is a good one: do it in the appropriate browser... too bad iOS is such a PIA for setting up (and porting to a VM) 
[23:19:58] lukeis: yep :-/ use saucelabs? (I don't know if they've made public iOS in their system though)
[23:20:10] lukeis: santiycr: ^
[23:23:32] ttk23: oh yea, kind of forgot about them.  Though, not excited to depend on a 3rd party (for-pay) service.  
[23:23:39] ttk23: regardless, thanks.
[23:24:27] jimevans: ttk23: cost-benefit analysis. how much time will it take for you to get the environment set up to do what you want, and how much is that time worth?
[23:24:35] santiycr: lukeis: we're still working on making iOS available to all users
[23:24:44] santiycr: probably won't happen for free users anytime soon
[23:25:02] santiycr: jimevans: +1
[23:25:16] santiycr: people tend to forget their time is worth money :)
[23:25:27] santiycr: specially engineers' time
[23:25:44] jimevans: as i've come to realize, there's very little that saucelabs does that can't be done by an external team.
[23:26:12] jimevans: the key to that statement is that it usually would take the external team a lot longer, and be a lot more expensive than using saucelabs
[23:26:52] santiycr: well, the miracles of outsourcing specialized efforts
[23:26:55] jimevans: (or some other cloud provider; saucelabs just happens to be the one i'm most familiar with)
[23:27:01] *lukeis is working my manager hard to get me an account to use (heavily) for my stuff :)
[23:29:27] santiycr: :)
[23:29:50] *santiycr is shocked lukeis and jimevans aren't the Se champions inside SFDC
[23:29:58] lukeis: heh
[23:30:02] jimevans: who says we're not! :)
[23:30:04] ttk23: ha
[23:30:07] lukeis: we're newbies here
[23:30:09] santiycr: heh
[23:30:44] jimevans: seriously though, i've been here less than 6 months. 
[23:30:59] *santiycr thinks jimevans and lukeis should be the simon and daniel of SFDC
[23:31:04] jimevans: not that i haven't made my preferences and ideas known.
[23:31:09] lukeis: hey, i support our internal users as often as they ask... and otherwise I'm in a completely different department and thus hands are tied
[23:31:36] santiycr: jimevans: my prediction: 1 month before you get internally hired for that!
[23:31:58] santiycr: lukeis: ^^
[23:32:03] *lukeis harps on the "simon and daniels" of sfdc for not automatically updating to the latest release when it's available
[23:32:17] jimevans: also, culturally, we also don't have many internal people who are as interested in building and debugging the framework as google does.
[23:32:35] *jimevans thinks of all the commits that are "on behalf of many Googlers"
[23:32:48] santiycr: true
[23:32:59] santiycr: I'm thinking more of an internal consulting role
[23:33:38] santiycr: where you travel and visit teams that need specialists to deal with doubts, issues and hopefully bugs
[23:33:55] santiycr: probably a convo over drinks, heh :)
[23:34:01] lukeis: there is one guy who does that
[23:34:16] lukeis: and i'm honestly shocked he's not involved in the Se community
[23:34:17] jimevans: not, i hasten to add, me. :)(
[23:34:18] santiycr: oh really?
[23:45:13] ttk23: is there an external resource for Docs (SauceLabs + Py + WebDriver) ?
[23:45:47] stephend: ttk23: do you want "in the wild"?  what are you looking for?  We use all of the above.
[23:46:33] ttk23: Sorry, not being clear.  looking for an example on how to execute JS in a saucelabs script but I think I figured out my prob. (spoke too soon)
[23:46:41] stephend: ah
