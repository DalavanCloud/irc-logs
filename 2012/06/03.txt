[20:54:22] barancev|2: it's quit today
[20:54:56] AutomatedTester: quiet?
[20:55:06] barancev: yes :)
[20:55:48] AutomatedTester: barancev: thought so was just checking, since you can speak more languages than me you are allowed typos
[20:56:40] barancev: in school I've learned German
[20:58:05] barancev: unfortunately it is vanished from my head... no practice
[20:59:07] AutomatedTester: barancev: any experience with xvfb?
[20:59:26] barancev: a little, no regular use

[21:06:15] AutomatedTester: but wanna try it
[21:06:26] AutomatedTester: I am getting segfaults with xvfb
[21:06:59] AutomatedTester: ahh figured it out
[21:07:44] Dude-X_:  fixing an unstable test, i can't believe a bad locator actually finds the element...
[21:08:35] Dude-X_: had an xpath find id/div[1]/a ; actual structure is div[id]/a
[21:08:44] AutomatedTester: interesting bug...
[21:09:00] AutomatedTester: I have just started xvfb in a VM and now my mouse isnt visible on my MBP
[21:09:04] AutomatedTester: on OSX

[21:11:18] barancev: where is our jenkins...
[21:14:40] barancev: javascript question: I have an object, obj.__proto__ == 'Error', but obj instanceof Error returns false -- how can this happen?
[21:20:25] AutomatedTester: um not sure, I have never used proto
[21:20:54] AutomatedTester: I worked with a front end dev a while ago who told me not to go there
[21:21:25] AutomatedTester: but I *think* from reading MDN is that you need to pass in a prototype of another object
[21:21:43] AutomatedTester: e.g. obj.__proto__ = Error.prototype;
[21:21:58] AutomatedTester: and not a string
[21:22:06] AutomatedTester: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/Proto
[21:22:18] nilian has joined #selenium
[21:22:43] barancev: I'm not constructing a new object, I've got it as a result and trying to detect its type
[21:23:07] Dude-X_: turns out it was a good locator, but using an xpath function was slow...
[21:23:15] Dude-X_: so now it's a css selector
[21:23:16] barancev: it looks like an Error object, because I can see that obj.__proto__ == 'Error'
[21:23:43] barancev: and I'm wondering why obj instanceof Error returns false?
[21:23:52] AutomatedTester: but Error appears to be a string...
[21:24:36] AutomatedTester: i dont really know...
[21:26:25] barancev: thank you for the idea, I'll make one more experiment with this object
[21:28:00] Dude-X_: god i wish i can spend the time refactoring old tests
[21:28:25] Dude-X_: certainly will fix slow xpaths
[21:29:56] ian_mac has joined #selenium
[21:38:54] AutomatedTester: Dude-X_: I tweeted yesterday about a how css paths can slow down web interaction
[21:39:14] AutomatedTester: I would love to see how bad css paths in the app and then in the tests impact speed
[21:39:21] AutomatedTester: in about 6 weeks time
[21:45:21] barancev: —Ä—É—Ä–± it's very interesting object I'm working with
[21:46:23] barancev: typeof obj returns 'object'
[21:46:48] barancev: but obj instanceof Object returns false
[21:48:37] barancev: obj.toSource() returns (new Error("A script from \xABhttp://www.google.ru\xBB was denied UniversalXPConnect privileges.", "http://www.google.ru/", 60))
[21:59:15] Dude-X_: i don't see anything about css paths in Dave's tweets...
