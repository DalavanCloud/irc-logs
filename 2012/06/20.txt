[00:00:56] AutomatedTester: is webbit the httpd of choice these days?
[00:01:05] dawagner: For what?
[00:01:18] AutomatedTester: for a lightweight web app
[00:01:44] dawagner: Hold on... You're writing java? Are you ok?
[00:01:57] AutomatedTester: no...
[00:01:57] dawagner: It's nice and lightweight, but scaling takes thinking about
[00:02:09] AutomatedTester: dawagner: it doesnt need to scale
[00:02:24] dawagner: It's also not particularly feature-heavy
[00:02:36] dawagner: But if you don't need features, it's lovely :)
[00:03:02] AutomatedTester: can I set up an end point
[00:03:07] AutomatedTester: and it its lightweight?
[00:03:18] AutomatedTester: thats my requirements
[00:04:16] dawagner: Then absolutely :)
[00:04:44] AutomatedTester: woop
[00:05:47] dawagner: Right, bed! T'ra!

[00:18:53] Dude-X: i don't hack on the Java stuff of the source code just python
[00:19:16] Dude-X: also i use Eclipse :p
[00:19:29] Dude-X: intelliJ is too different from Eclipse for me to switch over
[00:19:48] AutomatedTester: intellij is better... you should
[00:19:59] AutomatedTester: eclipse feels too clunky for me
[00:20:11] dawagner: They're differently clunky :)
[00:20:21] AutomatedTester: dawagner: thats just java 
[00:20:41] AutomatedTester: dawagner: do I need to put .idea files in a repo
[00:20:46] AutomatedTester: or will people not care?
[00:21:35] dawagner: They're handy to have
[00:21:46] dawagner: They add a bit of commit noise
[00:21:57] AutomatedTester: meh, I dont really care enough
[00:22:00] dawagner: Of course, if you were using maven, you wouldn't need to, beacuse there's a maven command to generate htem
[00:22:10] dawagner: `mvn idea:idea` or something

[14:01:08] nirvdrum: And I'll be able to return results faster.
[14:01:15] AutomatedTester: cool
[14:01:37] AutomatedTester: *sigh* java is winning again
[14:02:15] nirvdrum: What's wrong?  For all it's faults, Java is pretty straightforward and rarely surprises.
[14:02:28] *AutomatedTester cant make a jar executable
[14:02:31] AutomatedTester: it cant find my main
[14:02:41] nirvdrum: Did you add a manifest?
[14:03:12] nirvdrum: And more importantly, does the manifest have the Main-Class entry?
[14:03:48] AutomatedTester: I didnt add a manifest because the docs say I can use e to specify
[14:03:57] AutomatedTester: lets try a manifest
[14:04:03] lfryc has joined #selenium
[14:04:28] AutomatedTester: Manifest-Version: 1.0
[14:04:28] AutomatedTester: Main-Class: com.mozilla.seleniumgrid.servlet.SpeedyGonzalesServlet.class
[14:04:30] nirvdrum: Ahh.  I've never done it without a manifest.  My guess is -e would implicitly create one, since the user of the JAR would need to know how to find the class somehow.
[14:04:39] AutomatedTester: is that what I put in my manifest?
[14:04:54] nirvdrum: I'm pretty sure you don't put the ".class" part on.
[14:05:37] nirvdrum: It should just be the fully qualified name of the class.
[14:06:32] nirvdrum: Ahh, the -e option was added in Java 6.
[14:06:47] nirvdrum: What was the JAR command you were running?
[14:07:25] AutomatedTester: jar cvfm speedy-gonzales-servlet.jar ../../src/com/mozilla/seleniumgrid/servlet/Manifest.txt -C speedy-gonzales-servlet .
[14:07:59] dawagner: bsilverberg: Reviewed :) A trivial amount to do :)
[14:08:14] AutomatedTester: now when I run my jar it says failed to load Main-Class attribute
[14:10:57] bsilverberg: thanks dawagner. I'll probably get to it this afternoon
[14:11:13] jarib: AutomatedTester: remove .class 
[14:11:25] AutomatedTester: jarib: I did :/
[14:11:33] jarib: ah. 
[14:11:37] *jarib learns to read
[14:16:19] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I meant your original JAR command.  I was wondering if the classname might have been buggered there, too.
[14:17:03] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I usually find it helpful to extract the JAR to another directory to verify I in fact added all the files I thought I did.
[14:18:52] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: jar tvf speedy-gonzales-servlet.jar | less
[14:18:58] AutomatedTester: shows all the files
[14:21:51] bsilverberg: dawagner: Regarding your suggestion about the formatSpec at https://codereview.appspot.com/6306096/diff/2005/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/support/Color.java#newcode68
[14:22:06] webtester has joined #selenium
[14:22:36] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I guess I withdraw my earlier statement about Java then.
[14:23:18] bsilverberg: just making those changes causes a problem as Double.toString(alpha) won't work with the first formatSpec (if alpha == 1), and if I change the first %.0f to %s then I end up with 1.0 rather than 1
[14:23:50] bsilverberg: Should I have separate calls to String.format for each case?

[14:27:36] nirvdrum: I'm also a bit intrigued by a servlet with a main method.  What's it supposed to do?
[14:27:57] dawagner: bsilverberg: Either separate format specs, or even just: String alphaString = (alpha == 1) ? "1" : Double.toString(alpha); return String.format("%d, %d, %d, %s", red, green, blue, alphaString)

[14:55:20] Parabola: apple doesnt do resolution, they do scaling, so if you take any macbook and set it to "1024x768" it doesnt actually touch the resolution, it just scales to match what that would look like.
[14:55:53] Parabola: and by default its scaled to the normal macbook pro "resolution" which was whatever regular macbooks are, but its the first thing he changed, and windows are pretty small, but ungodly crisp

[16:05:41] guidocalvano: is there a good page with some reference

[16:06:01] nirvdrum: guidocalvano: //div[@id="flashMessage"]

[16:07:16] lukeis has joined #selenium
[16:07:38] guidocalvano: nirvdrum: and how would a validAttribute statement look?
[16:08:29] nirvdrum: I don't know what you mean.
[16:10:27] guidocalvano: I want to test if a div with some id x has a class y
[16:13:11] barancev: dawagner: no, R.java is not regeneratedб may be I need some andriod tools installed?
[16:14:17] guidocalvano: nirvdrum: I want to test if a div with some id x has a css class y
[16:14:52] jimevans: guidocalvano: are you able to locate the div? it's unclear from the pastebin you referenced.
[16:15:14] guidocalvano: jimevans: the expression of nirvdrum allows me to find the div
[16:15:24] nirvdrum: guidocalvano: You can search for an element like //div[@id="flashMessage"][@y]   IIRC.
[16:15:28] jimevans: ok, now you need to find whether it has the class you want?
[16:15:41] guidocalvano: jimevans: yes
[16:15:49] nirvdrum: Sorry.  //div[@id="flashMessage"][@class*='y']
[16:16:03] nirvdrum: (Assuming you may have multiple classes)
[16:16:25] jimevans: guidocalvano: give me a second.
[16:16:30] guidocalvano: yeah but won't this make the validAttribute fail? I need the xpath to return the class
[16:16:53] nirvdrum: jimevans can probably better answer.  I've never used validAttribute.  I was just trying to help out on the XPath side.
[16:17:04] guidocalvano: nirvdrum: big thanks though (:
[16:18:19] guidocalvano: I think I got it working
[16:18:23] guidocalvano: (: (:
[16:18:47] guidocalvano: /div[@id="flashMessage"]@class
[16:19:19] guidocalvano: I was confused cause find will disapprove of this path, even though the validation task can now succeed
[16:19:21] jimevans: i was approaching this from the wrong direction, apparently.
[16:19:59] lukeis: jimevans: it's taking every ounce of me to not respond to that issue with that trolling comment.... 'so, you like having to code browser specific things into all your tests? I suppose you dislike all javascript frameworks too?'
[16:20:37] jimevans: heh.
[16:21:52] jimevans: i've decided that i could be very happy if my legacy in the webdriver community was that my comment on #141 was the one that finally got through everyone's thick skulls and made them realize that the feature request was a bad idea.
[16:21:54] selbot2: 03 closed/wontfix WebDriver lacks HTTP response header and status code methods - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=141 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium]
[16:23:23] guidocalvano: is there a way to identify a generic node with some id?
[16:23:47] guidocalvano: so can i write an xpath expression that just matches purely on id?
[16:24:07] lukeis: "id('yourid')"
[16:24:27] lukeis: that's xpath ^ believe it or not ;)
[16:25:44] jimevans: guidocalvano: i'm still not sure i follow what you're trying to accomplish. you said you're trying to validate that a given div contains a given class. you need to do this with xpath why, exactly?
[16:26:08] jimevans: you're already locating the element with an id which should be unique, no?
[16:26:15] guidocalvano: jimevans: I want to test if our server gives an error if I login with the wrong password
[16:26:31] lukeis: but that would be certainly silly to do in selenium.... hopefully you're looking for some element under that id... is "id('yourid')//nodeImLookingFor[.='text']"  <- only reason i can think of to use xpath
[16:26:34] guidocalvano: jimevans: but… the message that says so could be in any language… internationalization
[16:26:40] jimevans: okay. no problem.
[16:27:05] jimevans: why don't you find the element using the id, then use getAttribute("class"), and see if the returned string contains the class you're looking for?
[16:27:16] jimevans: or am i missing the point?
[16:27:25] guidocalvano: that would work
[16:27:27] lukeis: guidocalvano: use css selectors??   "#flashMessage.class"
[16:27:35] barancev: how to get a given capability value in the firefox driver js code?
[16:27:52] guidocalvano: can I even use css selectors as locators?
[16:27:57] lukeis: yes :)
[16:28:04] guidocalvano: nice...
[16:28:13] *lukeis wants to be more emphatic... YES!!
[16:29:09] dawagner: barancev: You need the android sdk around, yeah
[16:29:11] jimevans: css selectors are even recommended over xpath where possible because of performance implications in certain browsers (css selectors are much faster [an order of magnitude in some cases] in IE)
[16:29:35] lukeis: and they are easier to grok by developers, who should also be maintaining the tests ;)
[16:29:40] *guidocalvano responds as someone from a tellsell commercial… WOW… that is what I've always dreamed of!!
[16:30:38] lukeis: only two reason i use xpath... when I *have* to find something by the text that is displayed on the page and when i want a parent node
[16:31:44] jimevans: lukeis: even in the case of wanting a parent node, i'm more likely to find the node i can, then call JavascriptExecutor.executeScript("return arguments[0].parentNode;");
[16:32:05] lukeis: yeah... but it's so much more to type... and i'm lazy ;)
[16:32:17] *lukeis has recommended that before too
[16:35:32] guidocalvano: can I invoke testing sequences, for instance to make sure that the test is logged in?
[16:35:43] jimevans: of course, i'd probably have my own framework that converts that wraps WebElement, and has that javascript call as a getParent() method.
[16:36:51] lukeis: i haven't been a fan of wrapping WebElement... since it tempts too many people to put some fucked up stuff in there :)
[16:37:18] lukeis: guidocalvano: that's typically a setUp method or similar
[16:37:51] *lukeis uses something completely different of course ;)
[16:37:52] guidocalvano: lukeis: we are testing in the browser ide
[16:38:07] lukeis: oh, with Selenium IDE?
[16:38:56] lukeis: if you can, try to export to WebDriver into your favorite programming language (java, c#, ruby, python) and use a testing framework there
[16:39:20] lukeis: otherwise each test in IDE will require the entire flow... logging in, etc.
[16:41:03] guidocalvano: lukeis: I am already very happy that we are using any testing, which I was pushing for it at my job interview
[16:41:07] guidocalvano: literally
[16:41:26] guidocalvano: you know how managers think about these things
[16:41:38] guidocalvano: I have to make this work
[16:42:41] lukeis: guidocalvano: sounds like an uphill battle :) good luck...
[16:42:46] guidocalvano: lukeis: first testing should be proven, then we can add more advanced stuff, have you got any advice?
[16:43:31] lukeis: start with webdriver, a 'real' programming language and some :wiki PageObjects 
[16:43:32] selbot2: 1: 03PageObjects: The Page Object pattern represents the screens of your web app as a series of objects - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects
[16:43:41] lukeis: you can then write one or two tests
[16:43:47] lukeis: put then in CI (like jenkins)
[16:43:53] lukeis: and run them all the time
[16:44:00] lukeis: (as in every check in)
[16:46:14] lukeis: some things I mandate to my team when writing tests... the test method should contain 0 selenium/webdriver calls, they all need to be in the page objects and a test isn't a test unless it is asserting something  (I have a few more, but they aren't coming to mind)
[16:47:22] AutomatedTester: If they dont say I am great then they are worthless
[16:47:39] lukeis: oops, forgot that one ;)
[16:48:23] lukeis: oh, one more PageObject methods always need to return something, (no void's)... return this/self; should be the most common
[16:48:54] lukeis: that's more a style thing ;) ... I love chaining my method calls on page objects
[16:49:27] *AutomatedTester had high hopes for lukeis
[16:50:43] guidocalvano: lukeis: a page object wraps an instance of a web page that is tested by selenium?
[16:50:44] AutomatedTester: lukeis: have you applied for your "time off" next week?
[16:50:56] guidocalvano: lukeis: how do you test redirects ?
[16:50:58] lukeis: guidocalvano: soo your test becomes a 'readable':   DestinationPage = LoginPage(driver).enterCredentials(username, password).sumbit();
[16:51:25] lukeis: redirect testing is done separately from webdriver
[16:51:38] guidocalvano: ok...
[16:51:51] guidocalvano: and web driver wraps a browser or something?
[16:51:54] lukeis: i just use an http utility to request the url and assert the 301 or 302 response as desired
[16:51:56] lukeis: yes
[16:52:14] guidocalvano: does it actually contain an instance of the browser?
[16:52:26] lukeis: it's running a real browser

[16:55:56] AutomatedTester: what ever floats your boats
[16:56:23] lukeis: guidocalvano: there's an export to straight webdriver code... but it's not at all how you should structure your final test
[16:56:53] guidocalvano: fact is it works fast, and any testing is better than no testing

[20:17:12] IvanDM: Exception caused by Permission to access properties: me haz those
[20:17:21] IvanDM: I'm using FF12 and Selenium 2.24.1
[20:17:25] IvanDM: same was with 2.23.1
[20:17:27] IvanDM: AND
[20:17:32] IvanDM: only on Windows (???)
[20:17:40] IvanDM: does anyone have any idea what's going on exactly?
[20:18:02] jimevans: IvanDM: which browser?
[20:18:03] AutomatedTester: IvanDM: like #2863?

[20:18:10] IvanDM: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2863
[20:18:11] IvanDM: Firefox
[20:18:19] IvanDM: jimevans: FF
[20:18:29] IvanDM: AutomatedTester: yes, exactly that.
[20:18:30] *AutomatedTester starts looking into that again
[20:19:05] IvanDM: AutomatedTester: that has been affecting us for the last 3 releases of Selenium
[20:19:10] IvanDM: and it struck suddenly
[20:19:14] *AutomatedTester can say the next version of FirefoxDriver doesnt have it
[20:19:21] AutomatedTester: IvanDM: its been there since Firefox 8
[20:19:45] IvanDM: AutomatedTester: what do you mean "doesn't have it"? the next firefox driver solves the issue?
[20:20:25] AutomatedTester: IvanDM: maybe solves it or just isnt hitting that code path
[20:20:45] IvanDM: and that FirefoxDriver is coming with 2.25 I suppose
[20:20:46] IvanDM: right?
[20:20:56] AutomatedTester: lol, no
[20:21:05] IvanDM: AutomatedTester: :(
[20:21:07] AutomatedTester: its still a bit out
[20:21:25] AutomatedTester: we are only passing around 1/2 the Selenium tests
[20:21:34] IvanDM: AutomatedTester: so, for now, I have to play catch with those errors and set browser capability policies as they occur?
[20:21:42] AutomatedTester: yea
[20:21:43] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[20:21:45] AutomatedTester: soz :/
[20:21:58] IvanDM: AutomatedTester: I see. That at least gives me perspective.
[20:22:12] IvanDM: AutomatedTester: last thing - is there a "adviced" list of properties that you guys are currently setting?
[20:22:27] IvanDM: I suppose even the official tests need to set those capabilities to run the tests, right?
[20:22:29] AutomatedTester: IvanDM: that bug has work arounds
[20:22:48] IvanDM: AutomatedTester: setPreference("capability.policy.default.HTMLDocument.readyState","allAccess");         setPreference("capability.policy.default.HTMLDocument.compatMode","allAccess");         setPreference("capability.policy.default.Document.compatMode","allAccess");        setPreference("capability.policy.default.Location.href","allAccess");         setPreference("capability.policy.default.Window.pageXOffset","allAccess");       
[20:22:53] IvanDM: that's what currently we set
[20:22:56] IvanDM: a lot of them
[20:22:57] IvanDM: :(
[20:23:16] AutomatedTester: IvanDM: the problem is far from simple to solve
[20:24:20] IvanDM: AutomatedTester: I'm sure it is. I was just wondering if the "experts" know of any list of capability.policy.default.* 
[20:24:41] AutomatedTester: as and when we find them the bug gets updated
[20:24:46] AutomatedTester: thats the best we can do
[20:25:03] AutomatedTester: something, not sure where so lets call it needle for now, has changed in the way that extensions speak to the browser

[21:26:23] adamgoucher: heh. clearly you havent seen mine. they were all on se-ide :D
[21:26:25] llaskin: I'm happy to have the commit bit, but know that my talents are elsewhere.  However, whenever someone comes in here asking a question, if I can, i endeavour to answer it.
[21:26:34] llaskin: you also maintain a PHP driver don't you
[21:26:48] Dude-X: selenium as a java project is too big for my brain; however I have done reviews of python code and minor suggestions to improve it
[21:26:53] jimevans: note that i'm not saying i agree or disagree with the proposition. 
[21:27:14] llaskin: well you posited it
[21:27:18] llaskin: so i would argue that you probably agree with it
[21:27:29] Chuckleteeth: what is the deal with webdriver not blocking on firefox for click?
[21:27:30] jimevans: not necessarily.
[21:27:40] llaskin: Chuckleteeth: we don't block on click.
[21:27:42] bmulholland: he's allowed to be a devil's advocate from the beginning
[21:27:45] Chuckleteeth: this is like the first time when something is working on IE but not on firefox
[21:27:59] Chuckleteeth: why do you block on IE then but not firefox?
[21:28:09] jimevans: but i'm not going to tip my hand one way or the other.
[21:28:56] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: element clicks aren't guaranteed to block. we make a "best effort" to do so, but if you're using native events, there's always going to be a race condition attempting to block on the next page load.
[21:29:03] jimevans: (or ajax call, or whatever)
[21:29:21] Chuckleteeth: but this isn't performing ajax, js or anything
[21:29:25] jimevans: in your particular case, this time, the IE driver wins the race, and the firefox driver loses.
[21:29:32] Chuckleteeth: its a direct <a> element : (
[21:30:11] jimevans: again, if you're using native events, there's always going to be a race condition in attempting to block to wait for the next page load (or navigation, in this case)
[21:30:24] jimevans: always.
[21:30:28] jimevans: it can't be avoided.
[21:30:54] llaskin: however jim, i woudl say that in general, people like using OSS projects
[21:30:56] Chuckleteeth: is this an issue with how long it takes for the browser to respond to the native call?
[21:31:00] llaskin: its few who come and hang around and do stuff with the team
[21:31:11] Chuckleteeth: such that you cant determine if the browser is in the 'before' or 'after' state?

[21:33:17] selbot2: ok!
[21:33:43] AutomatedTester: ooo that reminds me, I updated my gist vim plugin to work again
[21:33:45] AutomatedTester: yay
[21:34:03] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: got it in one. we send a click, and execute a wait routine which checks some set of states of the browser to see if the browser is navigating/loading a page. *but* since the click is a native event, it's asynchronous, and there's a chance that whatever condition we check evaluates to "the browser isn't navigating", for any number of reasons.
[21:35:34] jimevans: n.b. this explanation is all predicated on using native events. doesn't matter whether you're using advanced user interactions (actions class) or not.
[21:37:00] lukeis: jimevans: my only disagreement with your posit is that I know some people are very busy with other things... they may *want* to contribute / work on it... but it's not high enough on their priority list to make time for it
[21:37:44] jimevans: llaskin: i think people *do* like using OSS projects. what i'm wondering, is that if people want to contribute, why is the rate of receiving patches so low? (IvanDM_: "lack of github repo" responses will be cheerfully ignored)
[21:37:59] AutomatedTester: fml I need to catch a bus at 5:15am on Saturday
[21:38:06] lukeis: and then there's the whole "I'm a tester and don't feel adquate/ competent enough to actually help *code* something" ~ which i don't believe, but understand their feeling
[21:38:48] lukeis: good luck with that AutomatedTester 
[21:38:51] jimevans: lukeis: perfectly valid points.
[21:39:56] barancev: IE fails color tests, why?
[21:40:11] jimevans: barancev: which IE?
[21:40:20] jimevans: and which color tests?
[21:40:22] llaskin: jimevans: for the most part, its because people honestly don't have time or lukes reason, or because frankly people don't care enough
[21:40:40] llaskin: most of the people filing bugs are testers.  They file the bug, and just like in their life, expect a dev to fix it

[21:49:28] klrmn: thanks AutomatedTester!
[21:49:41] Chuckleteeth: some other native event which if handled, since the nature of the event stack, would have to point to the first event having already been handled

[21:51:29] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: we do some of that, in some cases, but <channels simonstewart here> attempting to wait for page loads is an instance of the halting problem. check this faq: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#Q:_WebDriver_fails_to_find_elements_/_Does_not_block_on_page_loa
[21:51:35] Dude-X: klrmn: what patch are you planning to submit? <curious>
[21:51:59] AutomatedTester: waves
[21:52:47] Chuckleteeth: well i understand you may never know when any javascript is done
[21:53:01] klrmn: well, i'm kinda confused about —browserTimeout, it's in the usage() statement but isn't parsed
[21:53:21] klrmn: but i'm also adding flags for enable-native-events and chrome-driver-path
[21:53:30] klrmn: the two flags i use most often
[21:53:34] Chuckleteeth: i mean i guess to properly brain storm a solution id have to investigate what all you have to work with when touching the browser... like callbacks and such
[21:54:20] klrmn: uh, why does building the selenium server require sudo?
[21:54:51] Chuckleteeth: i guess you are worried that if you go to poll the loading state of the browser, it could have gone to loading and finished inbetween polling
[21:54:59] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: it doesn't matter. there's no way you could detect the navigation 100% of the time with 100% reliability.
[21:55:04] Chuckleteeth: which would give you the impression it never did any loading at all
[21:55:11] adamgoucher: is there any reason why i would want to use htmlunit without js enabled?
[21:55:13] jimevans: yes. exactly so.
[21:55:54] lukeis: adamgoucher: to quickly crawl a site that has js on it that cause things to fail miserably :)
[21:55:58] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: or the other side of the same coin, which is that you poll, and finish polling before the browser begins navigating.
[21:56:14] testingb0t1 has joined #selenium
[21:56:29] lukeis: that's my use case at least...
[21:57:04] Chuckleteeth: well this is just gonna bite me all day now
[21:57:28] Chuckleteeth: there has to be a cleaner solution then polling for an expected condition specific to that particular click event
[21:57:40] Chuckleteeth: i understand its impossible to be 100% for all sites and behaviours
[21:57:42] lukeis: klrmn: shouldn't require sudo... and sometimes flags are picked up elsewhere (i think)
[21:57:52] Chuckleteeth: but simply clicking on a link? there has to be a way to make that work more consistently
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Jun 20 22:00:34 2012]
[22:00:34] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: but it's not. with native events, you're using the OS to throw events at the browser. it's outside the control of what you're looking for. no matter what method you use, there's a gap between when you issue the click and when you start looking for the effects.
[22:01:58] jimevans: using synthetic events, that's all within the browser, though it's not as accurate.
[22:02:00] Chuckleteeth: well you can gather hints as to how far along the browser is in the chain of events expected to happen
[22:02:04] klrmn: ah, doesn't require sudo…does require write permission inside the read-only repository
[22:02:16] Chuckleteeth: such as the additional event you can poll occurs, tells you the browser has processed the async event
[22:03:08] Chuckleteeth: also seperate from this question, why can't we get the IWebDriver interface from an IWebElement ?
[22:03:22] Chuckleteeth: that would be really really handy dandy
[22:06:09] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: because it's not specified by the API. :-P seriously, though, there's nothing tying an element to its driver, from the driver standpoint.
[22:06:34] Chuckleteeth: well what about when i use IWebElement.FindElement()
[22:06:36] jimevans: where would you find it handy? feel free to use :gist if you need to show code.
[22:06:37] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[22:06:53] jimevans: what about it?
[22:07:15] Chuckleteeth: does that not use the IWebDriver interface to perform the element search? I mean its tied to a driver still
[22:07:30] Chuckleteeth: i haven't looked under the hood at this stuff this was just my assumption
[22:08:06] jarib: hm, latest chromedriver appears to not be forwards compatible with chrome 21
[22:08:08] Chuckleteeth: its not like its own seperate object anymore... if i find an element, then kill the driver then try using element.findelement its not gonna work
[22:08:12] jimevans: no, actually it uses the ISearchContext interface.
[22:08:43] Chuckleteeth: well shit.
[22:09:18] jimevans: naming aside, let's make a distinction between the server component of a driver and the "things that relate to a browser instance represented by the IWebDriver interface"
[22:09:32] Chuckleteeth: all i wanted to do was make a lousy IWebElement extention method with a delegate for the poll condition
[22:10:16] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: what's wrong with using WebDriverWait?
[22:10:16] Chuckleteeth: but i can't make a webdriver wait in an IWebElement extention without having to also pass it in
[22:10:54] Chuckleteeth: webdriverwait is what i want to use, but it needs an instance of the webdriver
[22:11:09] Chuckleteeth: er
[22:11:12] Chuckleteeth: sorry not webdriverwait
[22:11:41] Chuckleteeth: or maybe it is
[22:11:47] Chuckleteeth: damn its been a long time for me
[22:12:07] jimevans: then don't use webdriverwait, roll your own. you can do it using DefaultWait<T> where T would be IWebElement
[22:12:34] jimevans: all the building blocks are there.
[22:13:46] Chuckleteeth: ok so i know how to do it with xpath, you can add ./ to your search
[22:13:52] Chuckleteeth: how can i do this with css selector
[22:13:53] jimevans: but WebDriverWait is what you're going to want, and you're going to want the driver instance.
[22:14:16] jimevans: css selector searches are properly rooted.
[22:14:17] Chuckleteeth: so i could say make a function ClickAndWaitForElementVisible() that is an extention to iwebelement and takes a delegate
[22:14:28] Chuckleteeth: what do you mean by properly rooted?
[22:14:48] Chuckleteeth: i dont want my search to be dependent on the parent element you are clicking on
[22:15:01] Chuckleteeth: im just using that element to get an ISearchContext
[22:15:10] Chuckleteeth: gnomesayin?
[22:15:23] jimevans: then you're going to need the driver instance.
[22:15:32] Chuckleteeth: damn it
[22:15:52] jimevans: but why don't you make it an extension on IWebDriver?
[22:15:54] davehunt: santiycr: hey
[22:16:17] Chuckleteeth: i know i could do that
[22:16:23] Chuckleteeth: i just wanted to bundle it with the normal click 
[22:16:41] jimevans: why? using it on the driver instance is clearer to your intent.
[22:16:42] Chuckleteeth: so you could say element.click, or element.clickandcheck(By.cssselector(some stuff you expect))
[22:16:45] stephend: remind me how I make a note for dawagner?
[22:16:47] jimevans: and cleaner to implement.
[22:16:58] stephend: using selbot2
[22:17:13] Chuckleteeth: i guess i'll do it your way
[22:17:14] jimevans: stephend: "colon note user"
[22:17:18] Chuckleteeth: but for the record i dont like it :PO
[22:17:31] stephend: selbot2: note dawagner http://i.imgur.com/M1YFp.jpg
[22:17:39] stephend: gah
[22:17:50] jimevans: prepend "note" with :
[22:18:01] jimevans: :note
[22:18:09] lukeis: and start with /msg selbot2  if you don't want everyone to see
[22:18:16] jfunk has joined #selenium
[22:18:17] stephend: thx guys
[22:19:37] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: if it bothers you that much, create your own wrapper Element class, which holds a reference to the IWebDriver instance as a member. it's all about building a framework on top of webdriver.
[22:20:08] lfryc has joined #selenium
[22:20:42] jimevans: the library itself is pretty low-level. one of it's major strengths is being used as a building block or foundation for more complex frameworks.
[22:22:11] klrmn: so how do i convince the selenium-read-only repo to let the build process put a file in it?
[22:22:56] hourback has left #selenium
[22:23:26] lukeis: chmod -R 777 :)
[22:23:37] santiycr: davehunt: yo
[22:24:36] davehunt: santiycr: just pinging to check your got my email about the plugin I'm hoping to release soon
[22:25:32] santiycr: davehunt: got it!
[22:25:40] davehunt: cool, thanks
[22:25:47] santiycr: didn't even attempt to go through my personal email today, though :)
[22:25:54] santiycr: 10 unread 
[22:26:18] santiycr: woah, that's awesome!
[22:26:58] santiycr: thanks, I'll read it today 
[22:27:26] davehunt: np, and thanks
[22:30:42] klrmn: my opinion my be worth significantly less than two cents, but the fact that you have to defeat the repo being read-only by ham-handedly changing permissions in order to be able to do a build may be negatively impacting the number of contributors
[22:31:46] lukeis: heh... i'll blame google code for that
[22:31:51] barancev: when I run go test_firefox onlyRun=FirefoxDriverTest there are two orphaned firefox windows remains after tests complete
[22:31:59] barancev: what to tune to close them all?
[22:33:07] lukeis: although klrmn I though an svn client wouldn't mark the files are read-only... seems odd it did, google code just recommends naming the checkout as such
[22:33:15] lukeis: s/though/thought/
[22:34:18] klrmn: i don't remember whether svn came pre-installed in snow-leopard or i installed it, but it's the command line tool i used
[22:35:42] lukeis: hrmph :-/   svn co http....  shouldn't make things read only
[22:36:35] jillio: is there quick command to shutdown the stand alone server from cli? if not i will do ps and grep on selenium stand alone get its pid and kill using pid
[22:37:21] IvanDM_: hey guys, anyone has a link to the Selenium new "official" github mirror?
[22:37:32] IvanDM_: on github you can find 50 of those
[22:37:33] klrmn: so, after building using the command suggested on the link given earlier, i'm getting "Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute from
[22:37:33] klrmn: build/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/server/server-standalone.jar"
[22:37:36] IvanDM_: which one is the right one?
[22:37:55] lukeis: ian_mac: only one i know of is https://github.com/Selenium2/Selenium2
[22:38:03] lukeis: IvanDM_: ^
[22:38:07] lukeis: sorry ian_mac 
[22:39:01] lukeis: jillio: there is one... i don't remember it off the top of my head... only  works for the standalone and not the hub though
[22:39:12] lukeis: standalone node *
[22:39:28] IvanDM_: lukeis: from the description I get that it's readonly
[22:39:35] lukeis: yep
[22:39:47] IvanDM_: aka, useless unless you can't really run an svn command without having an heart attack
[22:39:48] IvanDM_: :(
[22:39:50] barancev: jillio: wget http://localhost:4444/selenium-server/driver/?cmd=shutDownSeleniumServer
[22:40:01] lukeis: svn is still the repository
[22:40:51] IvanDM_: lukeis: yeah. this means I can still bother simons with "when are we going to use github" stuff
[22:41:03] lukeis: we'll never use github
[22:41:25] lukeis: well... as long as simon is alive ;)
[22:41:27] jimevans: lukeis: never say never. :)
[22:41:42] lukeis: thought that right after i said it
[22:42:51] hourback has joined #selenium
[22:43:07] jillio: thanks lukeis and barancev! i actually tried your suggestions brancev, but seemd like it didnt work. time for another try just to make sure.
[22:44:02] IvanDM_: lukeis: even though I talked with him f2f about this, I can't remember the reasoning behind this hold-on-svn - so, I assume I didn't agree with the reasoning
[22:44:04] IvanDM_: :)
[22:44:39] IvanDM_: but I respect the fact that this reason needs to be taken to who makes this awesome project: so, other main contrib, force Simon to do it :P
[22:44:45] lukeis: IvanDM_: i didn't say we weren't going to use git... i said not github
[22:45:25] jimevans: okay, gotta go. g'night everybody!
[22:45:25] jimevans has left #selenium
[22:45:27] lukeis: and i will be vey happy the day we start using git
[22:45:31] lukeis: very*
[22:46:01] lukeis: the likely path is move to git, but still on googlecode
[22:46:41] lukeis: simon and kristian need to spend some time together to get it down... last I heard most of the concerns were accounted for
[22:46:42] barancev: jillio: I have no wget installed but this script stops my selenium server: perl -MLWP::Simple -e "get('http://localhost:4444/selenium-server/driver/?cmd=shutDownSeleniumServer')"
[22:46:48] hourback has left #selenium
[22:47:09] barancev: may be you should change host/port in the URL
[22:47:42] lukeis: klrmn: what command did you use?  i usually just do ./go release   and that will end up building everything needed
[22:47:47] IvanDM_: lukeis: ah, sorry - I'm ok with Git on GCode too
[22:48:03] IvanDM_: lukeis: I (erroneously) keep saying github and git as interchangeable terms
[22:48:04] IvanDM_: they are not
[22:48:15] lukeis: nope they aren't :)
[22:48:39] klrmn: lukeis: ./go //java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/server:server:uber

[22:49:34] IvanDM_: lukeis: I'm a victim of "github" marketing.
[22:50:29] lukeis: klrmn: rake is a foreign language to me... try `./go release`  ... it does more than your command but does everything necessary to build the standalone server jar
[22:50:42] barancev: we store binaries in the SVN. think about git repo that stores lots of binaries (not the lates version but all the history in each clone)
[22:50:47] Dude-X: we just moved our internal repo to github… it's going to take some time for our team to figure out how to use it's features
[22:51:46] lukeis: barancev: i think kristian's script to copy the history fully is ignoring the binaries (or a good chunk of them at least)
[22:52:08] barancev: I hope so :)

[22:57:14] klrmn: thanks lukeis, i am now moving forward, even though i'm clearly not done
[22:57:32] lukeis: cool :)
[22:58:14] lukeis: you mentioned something about a website patch... did that get committed? (was that for sehq?)
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Jun 20 23:01:45 2012]
[23:01:45] klrmn: yes, for chapter 3...https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4056
[23:02:31] lukeis: cool, thx for the patch :)
[23:03:03] klrmn: i've learned not to watch patches like a hawk. they'll get reviewed and merged when they get reviewed and merged
[23:03:06] lukeis: barancev: feel free to cc me when u see doc's bugs still ;)
[23:03:16] barancev: ok
[23:03:36] lukeis: klrmn: we don't have a great review process... 
[23:03:51] lukeis: mentioning them in IRC gets them done quicker ;)
[23:05:54] klrmn: lukeis: noted =)
[23:07:14] klrmn: i also just filed a bug asking for permalinks to the latest version of the standalone server, etc…not something i think i can patch either in the documentation or the code…

[23:23:30] klrmn: awesome…yah, i had no way of testing to see if the formatting was going to come out right
[23:23:36] Dude-X: for grid, can i set all my options for firefox in a yaml file?
[23:23:43] Dude-X: like native events, firefox preferences?
[23:24:29] lukeis: klrmn: there's readme in the websites/www.seleniumhq.org folder, tells ya how to run it locally
[23:24:50] t0mcat: in the python api can you get the driver from a webelement?

[23:27:37] klrmn: lukeis: ooooh
[23:28:47] Dude-X: me love you long time barancev for putting this in :D
[23:29:03] Dude-X: we have navigation guards in our code that sometimes goes 'rogue'
[23:29:14] barancev: Dude-X: firefox only atm
[23:29:41] Dude-X: that's all we use for now
[23:29:48] Dude-X: well some of our teams use chrome
[23:29:51] Dude-X: but there's a good reason for that
[23:30:38] klrmn: ohfun. i modified org.openqa.selenium.server.cli.RemoteControlLaunder …and that class's usage() method is being used, but it's parseLauncherOptions() method is *not* the one being used
[23:30:48] Dude-X: with grid, how do you set the firefox profile? in the desiredCapaiblities part or can you set the profile options in the json/yaml node config file

[23:39:54] t0mcat: hm, so I'm thinking that, since ActionChains are fickle on Mac, would there be a way to use javascript to activate a dropdown menu?
[23:40:54] lukeis: if you know what javascript events == "activate" in your mind... then yes
[23:43:26] t0mcat: check this out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6157929/how-to-simulate-mouse-click-using-javascript/6158050#6158050
[23:44:38] lukeis: similar code exists in selenium
[23:45:58] t0mcat: that's not how action chains work, or is it?
[23:46:22] lukeis: depends
[23:46:55] t0mcat: okay... lol
[23:55:42] klrmn: sanity check: WebDriverWait doesn't have anything to do with NativeEvents, right?
[23:57:59] lukeis: klrmn: nope... it's just basically a while loop with a timing break... of course you could call something that uses native events inside that loop
[23:58:23] klrmn: *nod*nod*
[23:58:44] klrmn: somebody has been gratuitously marking tests native when they actually are not.
[23:59:15] lukeis: in Selenium code? or this your code?
