[00:11:10] sassda: I need to have a chrome with an installed plugin, I am looking at the documentation, it says to use "chrome.extentions" and provide a base64 encoded plugin, but I mean, if I base64 encode my plugin, it gives me like a huge line, isn't there any more practical way?
[00:12:07] sassda: I see some example giving this code
[00:12:09] sassda: capabilities.setCapability("chrome.switches", Arrays.asList("--load-extension=/path/to/extension/directory"));
[00:12:28] sassda: but this would mean that the extension needs to be where my webdriver server is actually running
[00:13:29] jarib: why is a "huge line" not practical? that's the way to go if you want the extension shipped over the network.
[00:16:49] sassda: ok, if that's the way to go, then we'll go with this

[00:25:22] santiycr: :noe lukeis aparently, 2.23.1 didn't help with Firefox 12 and 13, both browsers are kind of flakey in our service for some reason even on WD

[00:51:24] ttk23: just making sure my script-hanging issues isn't a syntax snafu. This is the way to change UserAgent in FF WebDriver via python right?  profile.set_preference("general.useragent.override",userAgent) where userAgent = "SomeUserAgentString"
[00:52:19] ttk23: (thanks in advance)

[01:22:41] santiycr: :note lukeis I take that back, the change worked great, except for when firefox 12 and 13 need to proxy through the Selenium proxy
[01:22:42] selbot2: ok!
[01:22:52] santiycr: God, I can't wait till we can get rid of that silly proxying 
[01:23:26] santiycr: this is what happens when you make your application do things it shouldn't do
[01:25:20] jarib: santiycr: you're proxying traffic from the browser to the interwebz? is that to work around SSL issues?
[01:26:00] santiycr: yeah, mainly
[01:26:17] santiycr: supporting any self signed certificate
[01:26:55] santiycr: sadly, there aren't many forward proxies out there that both work well and do a certificate override 
[01:27:18] santiycr: I'm considering browsermob proxy, but so far I've seen a lot of the same issues that selenium has
[01:27:35] jarib: it's basically the same code, isn't it
[01:27:39] santiycr: (as kevin pointed out, it's pretty much a fork of the same code)
[01:27:42] santiycr: yeah
[01:27:57] santiycr: the advantage is that it's running on a separate workflow
[01:28:24] santiycr: I've even seen java InterruptedException inside the Selenium logs (running in both WD and RC)
[01:28:45] santiycr: I believe this is introduced by the proxy and the worst part is it fucks up the automation thread 
[01:28:57] santiycr: s/I believe/my theory is/
[01:29:16] santiycr: so, browsermob proxy would be a win there
[01:30:05] santiycr: but, knowing it's based on Jetty from 3 years ago is not encouraging 
[01:30:31] jarib: yeah, surprised there's no existing lightweight proxy server that lets you do this
[01:36:25] ttk23: im using python wrapper for browsermobproxy, it's been good to me so far

[01:39:14] santiycr: yeah, in most cases, it's good, though users see issues in the most random cases
[01:39:49] santiycr: like web servers replying invalid Content-length or dropping the response mid-way through
[01:40:16] santiycr: browsers seem to be able to handle these, while jetty tends to fail 
[01:40:27] santiycr: tough to solve all these, sadly
[01:40:30] ttk23: the dropping is quite annoying.
[01:40:58] santiycr: agreed
[01:41:21] santiycr: sadly, it's hard to contradict people when they say "well, browsers here have no issues with this"

[11:53:18] Maior: so attempting to disable JavaScript in Webdriver with the Python bindings - is this going to require Mad Hacks? I've read http://stackoverflow.com/q/8613440/928098 which hasn't been inspiring...
[11:58:44] Ale has joined #selenium
[11:58:54] dawagner: Why are you trying to disable javascript?
[11:59:03] dawagner: It's almost certainly not going to work...
[11:59:40] andreastt: I'm actually currently discussing this with Scope developers here too.
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Jun 13 12:00:02 2012]
[12:00:02] andreastt: Although our situation is that JS is disabled on certain pages out of security concerns.
[12:00:15] andreastt: opera:historysearch, for instance.
[12:01:13] andreastt: What!  http://entagen.github.com/jenkins-build-per-branch/
[12:01:17] andreastt: I've been wanting that for ages.
[12:02:22] Maior: dawagner: so I can test our site works without it...?
[12:04:28] Maior: this seems a reasonable thing to want to test
[12:05:31] AutomatedTester: Maior: since WebDriver relies on JavaScript you are probably going to have a really bad time
[12:06:03] Maior: AutomatedTester: ah. bugger.
[12:06:33] AutomatedTester: Maior: it *may* work as it runs the JS in a different context
[12:06:55] AutomatedTester: but we have not tested it so cant guarantee the way that it will behave
[12:07:15] AutomatedTester: dawagner: are you still using rdio or have you gone back to spotify?
[12:11:03] dawagner: Maior: You can disable javascript in HtmlUnit
[12:11:12] dawagner: And HtmlUnit should be sufficient to check that your site works
[12:11:17] dawagner: (Using the HtmlUnitDriver)
[12:11:29] dawagner: Because the big place HtmlUnit falls over is complex javascript, and by disabling that, you're good
[12:11:32] dawagner: Just no screenshots
[12:12:02] dawagner: AutomatedTester: I gave up on rdio, I had enough problems with their UI, and spotify has stopped crashing enough that I'm happy
[12:12:15] AutomatedTester: fair enough
[12:12:19] dawagner: I do miss the "just play me stuff I probably like"ness
[12:13:12] dawagner: Achievement Unlocked: Was emailed picture of magical unicorn at work
[12:13:26] AutomatedTester: dawagner: from the bearded one?

[12:13:55] AutomatedTester: *snore* bbiab
[12:14:15] dawagner: Alas not
[12:14:49] dawagner: So it turns out:
[12:14:50] dawagner: @ERROR: chroot failed
[12:14:54] dawagner: rsync error: error starting client-server protocol (code 5) at main.c(1534) [Receiver=3.0.9]
[12:14:55] *AutomatedTester realises he hasnt had a chat with him in what feels like an age :/
[12:15:07] dawagner: Is the super-useful error message you get if the directory you're copying with rsync doesn't exist
[12:15:21] *dawagner <3 user-friendly unix tools
[12:15:23] AutomatedTester: dawagner: the error message looks fine
[12:15:29] *AutomatedTester understands it
[12:16:12] dawagner: I associated chrooting with much loftier things than copying files
[12:16:43] AutomatedTester: dawagner: when you see those types of errors think old school MS error codes

[13:10:18] simonstewart: Maybe a bit more if you're feeling slow
[13:10:53] dregin: Dublin has a pretty sweet public bike system. You register with your credit card details, then use the card to unlock bikes from stands that are all over the city.
[13:11:06] dregin: As long as you have the bike back in another stand within half an hour, it's completely free.

[13:12:00] dregin: To encourage car pooling.

[14:17:29] theabrar: anybody?
[14:17:32] ebass: /*[contains(text(),'ZeroWidthSpace')]
[14:17:45] ebass: i missed a forward slash

[14:18:04] theabrar: cool..
[14:18:15] ebass: lol, it looks like my IRC client removes it

[14:18:29] ebass: no
[14:18:32] theabrar: oh ok
[14:18:39] ebass: it looks for that text inside of all nodes
[14:19:04] theabrar: oh..sorry I'm not looking for certain text
[14:19:51] theabrar: my Application uses GWT and sometimes for displaying names it add '&ZeroWidthSpace' in text (in the DOM)
[14:20:49] theabrar: <span class="Name">test&ZeroWidthSpace</span>
[14:20:56] theabrar: the above is from DOM
[14:21:15] theabrar: the actual text is just 'test' but in the DOM it shows as above..
[14:21:51] theabrar: and if i use the xpath as //span[@class='Name' and text()='test']
[14:21:57] theabrar: doesn't work
[14:24:32] theabrar: any solution?
[14:28:53] RossPatterson: Use the XPath "normalize-space(...)" function.

[15:06:37] AutomatedTester: Maior: the message you get in the exception would tell you if you need to look at it
[15:06:55] AutomatedTester: Maior: exception messages tend to tell you the info you need...
[15:07:19] Maior: AutomatedTester: I mean "what it is as an object"
[15:07:51] Maior: is it base64, is it some kind of image object, is it a crude ascii-art rendering, etc.
[15:08:17] AutomatedTester: morse code
[15:08:27] AutomatedTester: its my favourite way to transmit data
[15:08:27] Maior: cool
[15:08:37] AutomatedTester: its Base64
[15:08:44] Maior: my wpm's a bit low still, could do with increasing it
[15:09:01] Maior: cheers
[15:09:30] Maior: my fundamental question - have I missed something that says that, or is that information only available by reading the source / looking at the object / Knowing It
[15:09:43] Maior: and if the latter's the case, can I rely on it in any way?
[15:09:57] cmcgraw has joined #selenium

[16:01:31] foolx: In java: When i got the element id="cboxClose" i can find it via: By.id("cboxClose") OR via By.cssSelector(input[id='cboxClose']) right?
[16:01:44] foolx: just to be sure i create valid cssSelectors ;)
[16:02:03] ebass: right...i would use #cboxClose for your cssSelector
[16:02:10] foolx: why #?
[16:02:15] ebass: or input#cboxClose
[16:02:18] ebass: just short hand
[16:02:21] ebass: for id=
[16:02:45] foolx: ah, okay so instead of input[id='cboxLoadedContent'] i could use input[#cboxLoadedContent]
[16:02:53] ebass: no brackets
[16:03:03] ebass: input#cboxLoadedContent
[16:03:21] ebass: says any input element with the id='cboxLoadedContent'
[16:03:27] foolx: By.cssSelector(#cboxLoadedContent)
[16:03:34] ebass: that works too
[16:03:49] foolx: without any '' ?
[16:03:54] ebass: since id's *should* be unique
[16:04:05] ebass: well, you probably need to send a string to the By.cssSelector
[16:04:16] ebass: By.cssSelector("#cboxLoadedContent")
[16:04:41] foolx: thats not the problem since the value is already saved in a string field and i would just send the string

[16:12:32] jsanchez_: is there any good workaround for the MoveTargetOutOfBoundsException? We are seeing this too often, and usually on drop downs
[16:12:35] d0x: simonstewart: is there another we to validate the print option?
[16:12:57] simonstewart: jsanchez_: a repeatable, reduced test case attached to an issue would Really Help
[16:13:04] simonstewart: d0x: not using selenium
[16:14:27] foolx: another short one: class="logoutbutton_profil_user" would be [class='logoutbutton_profil_user']
[16:15:30] foolx: the total div looks like this: <div class="logoutbutton_profil_user" onclick="location.href='/logout'">Logout</div>
[16:16:03] Dude-X: jsanchez_: maximize the browser?
[16:16:26] jsanchez_: I have tried that but we are limited to small resolutions on Grid and Sauce
[16:16:33] jsanchez_: locally on my Mac it is perfectly fine
[16:16:39] Dude-X: foolx: if it's a css selector, .logoutbutton_profil_user
[16:16:56] Dude-X: why are you limited to small resolutions on Grid (can't speak for sauce)
[16:17:12] skiphuffman_: This might be a chrome driver question, but I will start here.  Why is .maximize_window throwing an exception for me on Chrome?

[16:22:37] jsanchez_: simon, what would be the best way for me to get you that reproducable case?

[16:22:54] selbot2: lukeis: note from simonstewart about 3 hours ago: Fair enough 
[16:23:11] simonstewart: jsanchez_: how do you produce a reduced test case?
[16:23:28] simonstewart: Attempt to navigate to the point which fails in your test and save the page as a web archive
[16:23:45] Dude-X: xvfb (on unix systems) is the X virtual frame buffer, it basically renders to a virtual screen (which in this case is not your display card but just computer memory)
[16:23:45] simonstewart: Then write a test that loads that single page and then fails to click
[16:24:01] simonstewart: If you're sensitive about revealing information, edit the HTML
[16:24:33] jsanchez_: i see, okay then should I zip that up and email it to you?

[16:26:05] steve90000: Hey guys, using webdriver python bindings - how can I click on a page element, have it open in a new window but keep the focus on the page from which I clicked?
[16:26:17] simonstewart: should happen by default
[16:26:21] jsanchez_: okay thank you! but does this sound like something to you that is even an issue that should be fixed if I can reproduce? or do you think it just the way it works? meaning is the MoveTargetOutOfBoundsException the expected outcome if you try to click on a drop down that is partially outside of the viewing area
[16:28:11] lukeis: webdriver should scroll the element into view... if it truly can only be partially in the viewable screen, and the user can click on it, then yes webdriver should be able to also. this would be one of those corner cases though ;)
[16:29:00] Dude-X: webdriver will scroll so long as user is able to scroll to it, if the user can't then webdriver can't either
[16:29:51] Dude-X: steve90000: webdriver will not switch focus to the new window. you have to do so explicitly
[16:30:17] lukeis: for me it sometimes scrolls things a user can't scroll ;)  hasn't 'broken' anything for me yet though
[16:30:28] jibay has joined #selenium
[16:30:41] Dude-X: probably because there's no CSS that's strict about placement

[16:32:22] d0x: simonstewart: is it possible to disable the print dialog
[16:32:31] d0x: that my application doesnt freeze
[16:32:36] lukeis: well also we have some pages that use jQuery iScroll ... yeah, it doesn't like being messed with the way selenium does "scrollling" ;)
[16:32:49] d0x: like webdriver.enable.native.events
[16:33:31] lukeis: d0x: not that I'm aware of... can you avoid it somehow? like not click something, or inject javascript to override window.print() ?
[16:35:49] d0x: lukeis: i think inject javascript to override window.print is good
[16:35:56] d0x: i can't avoid clicking it

[17:14:25] foolx: lukeis: we have 2 different pagedesigns running (still ... ;( ) and the other one doesn't have a class at that button, so i would like to use cssSelector for both ways

[17:41:18] foolx: ? should not be any problem ... was never a problem before
[17:41:19] jimevans: klrmn: in what sense?
[17:41:50] klrmn: some of the mozilla sites have a situation where the ActionChains are succeeding in doing the right thing maybe one time in ten
[17:41:57] foolx: also he says the object would be "HTMLInputElement ... i never assigned that
[17:42:21] Dude-X: the interactions api is kind of new so it needs work
[17:42:24] jimevans: klrmn: using firefox? or another browser?
[17:42:45] klrmn: stand-alone server 2.22, firefox 12, on winxp
[17:43:14] jimevans: klrmn: then i don't know what the issues are. for IE, i can point to exactly where the problems are, chapter and vers.
[17:43:22] jimevans: verse*
[17:43:53] klrmn: *nod*
[17:44:14] klrmn: i'd try running it in IE but the tests use a lot of css locators not supported by IE
[17:44:41] klrmn: (and mozilla isn't highly motivated to do testing on IE =)
[17:46:03] jimevans: very few people outside of MSFT are highly motivated to do testing on IE. and they're not as eager to play ball with the selenium community as i'd like
[17:46:16] Dude-X: why is that?
[17:46:25] Dude-X: oh because they can't make money out of it?
[17:46:42] jimevans: i'm not trying to be flippant or catty.
[17:46:51] Dude-X: actually a microsoft sanctioned automation tool might attract the wrong people
[17:47:14] jimevans: there was, at one time, a huge anti-open-source bias at the company.
[17:47:48] jimevans: things have improved a little, but the corporate culture still has pockets of that bias where long-time employees are in charge.
[17:47:58] jimevans: the IE group is one of those pockets.
[17:50:22] jimevans: Dean Hachamovitch is one of the old-guard. i knew him a little when he worked on Office.
[17:50:25] Dude-X: I think the IE group tries to do the right thing to to have standards
[17:50:43] jimevans: which is one reason we're trying to push webdriver as a standard.
[17:50:43] Dude-X: to have matching standards but they get pushed by back by upper management

[17:57:52] klrmn: jimevens: if you have anything written up on ActionChains and IE, maybe it'd give me a clue about what's going on in FF
[17:59:44] jimevans: no, i don't have anything written up, and the problems are directly related to IE-only. specifically, if the physical mouse cursor is within the bounds of the IE window.

[19:10:45] bmulholland: So my website has a standard header/footer with some basic actions, such as load X page. To model that, all my pages inherit from one BasePage. However, BasePage has actions that load some of my pages (which, remember, inherit from BasePage). How do I best avoid the circular dependencies this creates?
[19:11:02] mydog2 has joined #selenium
[19:12:33] foolx: ebass: seems to work! Thanks a lot!
[19:13:13] klrmn: bmulholland: that doesn't have to create circular dependencies, but it does require that the methods that load new pages return page objects
[19:14:27] rbalent has joined #selenium
[19:14:27] rbalent has joined #selenium
[19:15:08] bmulholland: klrmn: I guess my problem is that BasePage imports HomePage, but HomePage imports BasePage. Best practices in Python (which I'm using) are to put the imports at the top of the file. What happens then is HomePage is loaded, which brings in BasePage, which brings in HomePage… Error :)
[19:15:28] bmulholland: I'm wondering what the best practices are to avoid that… seems like I'll have to use some inline imports
[19:16:07] klrmn: why does BasePage import HomePage?
[19:16:42] bmulholland: because all pages have an action click_logo, which takes you back to the home page
[19:16:48] farlan has left #selenium

[19:27:31] Dude-X: no
[19:27:49] Dude-X: if you have circular imports, your'e doing it wrong;
[19:28:26] Dude-X: in my test suite, most page objects are independent classes
[19:29:08] Dude-X: if we need another class, we just import them and use them as regular member variables
[19:29:31] Dude-X: buut this is in java and we tend to treat these page objects as singletons :/
[19:29:43] Dude-X: i did not write the initial architectrue; but it works so far
[19:30:57] bmulholland: Dude-X: So say you have two pages. Page1 links to Page2. Page2 has "Click To Go Back" link. Page1 now needs Page2, and Page2 needs Page1 so that they can each return the correct PageObject, right?
[19:31:29] Dude-X: i don't ever return page objects; we use a different model for tests
[19:32:03] bmulholland: Dude-X: Ah, okay. I'm using what I believe is the standard PageObject pattern

[23:36:28] lovedaddy: evening everyone - just wondering if there is an ETA on 2.23 for Ruby?  Using FF13 here and the native events dont seem to work (windows 7, ff13, selenium-webdriver 2.22.2 with watir webdriver 0.6.1)

[23:43:16] lukeis: :note jarib releasing 2.23 for ruby may be a good idea (soonish) since it would enable native event support for FF13... you know, if you have time :-D
[23:43:17] selbot2: ok!
