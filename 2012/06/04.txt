[12:58:29] barancev: or may be non-thread-safe connection manager :)
[12:59:06] barancev: what was changed in 2.21 that fixed this issue?
[12:59:07] nirvdrum: All older versions of Selenium?

[IRC logfile - Started Mon Jun  4 13:02:32 2012]
[13:02:32] barancev: so this line in the changelog: "Significant changes in the timeout strategy between hub, nodes and browser." ?
[13:02:50] barancev: it claims there changes?
[13:03:02] nirvdrum: Those timeouts really should just affect grid, AFAIK.
[13:05:58] nirvdrum: I have no idea how that plays with JUnit timeouts, unfortunately.
[13:07:04] barancev: so these changes should affect 2657, but 1998 may be a different thing

Protected Mode must be set to the same value (enabled or disabled) for all zones. (WARNING: The server did not provide any stacktrace information)
[14:46:38] sburjan`: Command duration or timeout: 24". I managed to fix this on IE8 disabling protection on all zones. I did the same for IE9 but doesn't seem to help. I also found a bug report about this, but it's one year old closed as Won't Fix. Could someone guide me what should I do ?
[14:49:59] barancev: sburjan`: sburjan`: what selenium version do you use?
[14:51:57] barancev: latest versions (2.21+ should add some more info to the error message)

[16:01:35] ebass: you can use the driver.getWindowHandles function to wait for the window handle to appear in the set returned
[16:02:26] ebass: or you could  keep trying to switch to the window 
[16:02:27] spliffy: but how do i wait? with Thread.sleep(n)?
[16:02:30] barancev: spliffy: how to wait for a window if you know its title: https://gist.github.com/2868883
[16:02:38] ebass: there is a built in API for that stuff
[16:02:40] ebass: WebDriverWait
[16:02:44] ebass: and ExpectedCondition
[16:02:46] ebass: use those.
[16:02:57] spliffy: i know nothing about the new window. only that i have one more window after it opens
[16:02:59] ebass: I know they are available using the Java API, not sure about the others.

[16:03:46] jrock20041: barancev: That dows not mean the window is fully loaded though is it
[16:03:59] barancev: yes!
[16:04:22] jrock20041: I have see a browser title but the page is still loading
[16:04:24] ebass: you should know something about the window...in either case. you could get the open windows before  clicking the link
[16:04:37] ebass: and then figure out which one is new
[16:04:56] barancev: morover, you have to wait additional 200ms before swtching to a new window agter you've got its handle -- see #2764

[16:05:42] ebass: that seems like a pretty common thing
[16:05:48] barancev: and after switching to a new window you have to wait an element inside it you are going to interact with

[16:06:17] barancev: ebass: may be, sometimes, they'll be added
[16:06:39] barancev: there are many conditions, it's impossible to add them all

[16:06:45] ebass: i was just thinking that
[16:07:07] ebass: slippery slope
[16:07:44] jrock20041: spliffy: A thing to think about as I run into this
[16:07:58] jrock20041: just cause the element has loaded does not mean the page is ready
[16:08:27] jrock20041: after that element loads there could be some javascript that alters that element causing an issue of caching
[16:08:40] ebass: right jrock20041, but it's your responsibility to know when a page is ready
[16:08:52] ebass: WebDriver cannot do everything for you :-D
[16:08:58] jrock20041: oh I know that
[16:08:59] llaskin: yea you can still switch to the screen and then once you switch, wait more
[16:09:22] jrock20041: ebass: I realize that and I am not stating web driver should

[16:11:35] ebass: gtailleb have you read the intro wiki on how to use webdriver?
[16:11:47] ebass: i would suggest starting there.
[16:12:06] gtailleb: i've been using webdriver with firefox/ie for more than a year now

[16:12:40] gtailleb: but trying to use it with iedriverserver.exe fails... can't find any documentation on that
[16:13:42] gtailleb: i could also play a bit with chrome using a RemoteWebDriver(url, DesiredCapabilities.chrome()) and the chromedriver.exe.. but no luck at all with ie
[16:14:27] cgoldberg: gtailleb, you need to be much more specific that "it fails" and "no luck"
[16:14:45] gtailleb: ok may i post some code and stack on here?

[16:15:53] jimevans: ebass: possibly. i'm pretty swamped at the moment, but i'll help however i can.
[16:15:53] cgoldberg: ebass, pastebin your stack trace and the line of code that caused it
[16:15:57] ebass: but i imagine if it works like the chromedriverserver then your remotewebdriver instance needs to point to the correct port.
[16:16:04] cgoldberg: oops.. gtailleb ^^
[16:17:06] gtailleb: ok here is the pastebin : http://pastebin.com/0V12VNzT
[16:18:24] gtailleb: i start the iedriverserver.exe with no arguments, so it point to an weird ip like 2.22.0.0:5555
[16:19:42] ebass: im assuming the server is started on a different machine than the one running the client code
[16:19:48] ebass: a Windows machine
[16:20:21] gtailleb: and then i instanciate my RemoteWebDriver (client) with dns name of the machine is started the exec on : new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://dns.name.of.the.machine:5555"), DesiredCapabilities.internetExplorer());
[16:20:43] ebass: if your on linux run nmap -p5555 against the windows machine's IP or DNS
[16:20:46] gtailleb: ebass : yep
[16:20:52] ebass: to see if its listening correctly
[16:21:06] gtailleb: ebass: ok i'll try that
[16:22:09] ebass: ill download the ieserver so i can see if i have the same problem

[16:22:26] ebass: ok
[16:22:39] ebass: thats good

[16:22:49] ebass: nope
[16:23:00] pash1k has joined #selenium
[16:23:04] ebass: its just a service that nmap knows that uses that port
[16:23:28] ebass: just a coincidence that iedriverserver uses that port
[16:23:50] ebass: if it lisened on port 80 nmap would think it was http
[16:23:57] gtailleb: okay
[16:24:15] ebass: did u run nmap with the DNS entry or the IP address
[16:24:20] gtailleb: dns
[16:25:23] ebass: try opening a browser and pasting that IP address and port into it...just curious about what happens
[16:25:25] gtailleb: same output from nmap if i run with local ip
[16:25:33] jimevans: okay, wait. what do you mean "it points to a weird ip like 2.22.0.0:5555"?
[16:26:16] gtailleb: i start iedriverser.exe (no line arguments like --port or --host) and it outputs :
[16:26:16] gtailleb: Started InternetExplorerDriver server (64-bit)
[16:26:16] gtailleb: 2.22.0.0
[16:26:16] gtailleb: Listening on port 5555
[16:26:29] ebass: thats just the version of selenium i think
[16:26:34] jimevans: 2.22.0.0 is the version.
[16:26:45] gtailleb: oh true, i'm dumb :)
[16:26:47] Dude-X: hey when you call findElementBySelector, does it use browser CSS rules (matches from the right key selector, then works to the left) or does it use document.getElementByCssSelector)
[16:27:03] Dude-X: which may mean left to right
[16:27:21] ebass: Dude-X: I am pretty sure it uses the browsers native CSS selector engine

[16:27:32] ebass: which i think would be the same as document.getElementByCssSelector
[16:28:02] Jackneill has joined #selenium
[16:28:08] Dude-X: well yesterday i was reading about efficient selectors, and some said that jquery migth actually follow a different rule because it's doing programmatic lookups
[16:28:24] jimevans: jquery might be using its own selector engine too.
[16:28:32] Dude-X: so it made curious as to what webdriver does
[16:28:33] jimevans: not the one the browser supplies.
[16:28:34] ebass: jquery usually does use its own selector engine
[16:28:38] ebass: called Sizzle
[16:29:35] ebass: if webdriver cannot find a native css engine i believe that for certain browsers it will fall back to the sizzle selector engine.

[16:30:20] jimevans: gtailleb: so you start up the iedriverserver.exe on a windows machine, and attempt to use RemoteWebDriver from a linux machine connecting to the IEDriverServer on the remote machine, and it's failing. (making sure i understand the scenario since i came in late).
[16:30:32] gtailleb: browser : 
[16:30:32] gtailleb: -127.0.0.1:5555 => outputs "This is the initial start page for the WebDriver server."
[16:30:32] gtailleb: -192.168.xxx.xxx => outputs "The connection was reset. The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading...."
[16:30:52] ebass: are your machines on the same network?
[16:31:02] gtailleb: jimevans : that's it
[16:31:16] gtailleb: yep, they ping correctly
[16:31:17] barancev: jimevans: do you know whether #2558 was fixed in IE?
[16:31:18] selbot2: 03 open/new ((Locatable)WebElement).getLocationOnScreenOnceScrolledIntoView() returns browser relative coordinates instead of screen coordinates - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2558 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Component-WebDriver]
[16:31:39] jimevans: barancev: no idea. i've not specifically looked at it.
[16:32:05] barancev: ok
[16:32:43] jimevans: gtailleb: oh, wait. you can't do that.
[16:33:04] gtailleb: jimevans: i can't do what?
[16:33:20] jimevans: the IE standalone server won't accept connections from remote machines as it's currently coded.
[16:33:45] jimevans: the correct solution there is to use the remote java server on your windows machine.
[16:33:45] sburjan`: hello jimevans. I was told that you can point me on fixing the issue with "org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Unexpected error launching Internet Explorer. Protected Mode must be set to the same value (enabled or disabled) for all zones. (WARNING: The server did not provide any stacktrace information)" using IE9. I tried enabling and disabling Protection for all zones, but I still have 
[16:33:46] sburjan`: the issue. I am running on Windows 7 32 bit and Selenium 2 2.21.0
[16:34:20] jimevans: sburjan`: update to 2.22. it won't solve the problem, but it'll give you a better error message.
[16:35:14] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[16:35:26] gtailleb: jimevans: what do mean "remote java server"? RemoteWebDriver? so, the iedriverserver.exe and the RemoteWebDriver(cap.ie) must be on the same machine?
[16:36:53] jimevans: no, don't misunderstand me. you should be running the java remote server (selenium-standalone.jar) on the remote machine.
[16:37:10] jimevans: you connect to the java process, not directly to the IEDriverServer.exe process.
[16:37:33] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[16:37:36] jimevans: hang on though. i need to check something
[16:38:11] gtailleb: jimevans: oh ok, that's what i'm doing for the moment by using the ie legacy internal  server (useLegacyInternalServer) and starting a java standalone server
[16:38:46] sburjan`: jimevans: thanks, I'll be back if I won't be able to fix with the help of the better message
[16:39:23] jimevans: gtailleb: yeah, drop IEDriverServer.exe on your path on the remote machine, and remove the useLegacyInternalServer capability, and see if that still works.
[16:40:02] gtailleb: ok i'll try that thx
[16:42:39] jimevans: gtailleb: in the source code, the actual behavior is specified in $/cpp/webdriver-server/server.cc, line 86. in that line of code, we're setting the options of the mongoose http server. we specifically set the access control list to deny connections to all IP addresses, then allow them to 127.0.0.1.
[16:42:59] Swadq has joined #selenium
[16:43:23] Swadq: Hey, could someone help me please? I'm trying to target a frame with an xpath, and I'm not sure of the syntax
[16:43:39] Swadq: I'm using Java, and I know that the method is selenium.selectFrame(String)
[16:43:41] gtailleb: jimevans : ok, so client (RemoveWebdriver) and server (iedriverser.exe) must be executed on same machine, is i understand well...
[16:43:51] jimevans: no, not at all.
[16:44:00] gtailleb: so what does it mean?
[16:44:01] jimevans: server and server must be on the same machine :)
[16:44:11] gtailleb: i'm confused now :)
[16:45:15] jimevans: there are two servers. one is the java remote server. it's contained in selenium-standalone.jar. (which is also the jar the client is in, so that's mildly confusing). the other server is the native (C++) IE standalone server, IEDriverServer.exe
[16:45:59] gtailleb: i must then start the 2 servers?? the standalone jar AND the iedriverserver.exe???
[16:46:04] jimevans: your *client* code can be run from whatever machine you like, it just talks to the *java* server, not directly to the IEDriverServer.exe
[16:46:22] gtailleb: oooooooooohhhh, i'm starting to get it
[16:46:29] jimevans: theoretically, yes, but remember that the java server will start the IE server automatically for you.
[16:48:39] gtailleb: so i just do a 
[16:48:39] gtailleb: start "webdriverserver2.22_1" java -jar lib/selenium-server-standalone-2.22.0.jar" and that's it? no need to do anything with the iedriverserver.exe?
[16:48:45] jimevans: to enable direct remote communication with the IEDriverServer, I'd need to make a change to the server code to be able to accept a whitelist of IP addresses. the last thing i want to be accused of is compromising a user's machine because i opened an unsecured  HTTP port to the whorld.
[16:49:12] jimevans: gtailleb: as long as iedriverserver.exe is on the path on the remote box, that's absolutely correct.
[16:49:16] gtailleb: i understand.. 
[16:49:21] jimevans: or it should be, i haven't actually tried it.
[16:49:28] gtailleb: :)
[16:49:55] Swadq: Could anyone help me with selecting a frame with an xpath?
[16:50:50] Dude-X: driver.switchTo.frame('name, webelement, or id')
[16:51:17] Swadq: Dude-X: it doesn't have a name or an id, all I have is the xpath
[16:51:26] Swadq: How would I find the webelement?
[16:51:33] Swadq: (in java)
[16:52:00] Dude-X: findElementByXpath('//div/frame')
[16:52:25] Swadq: Thank you, I'll try that
[16:52:26] gtailleb: jimevans: thx for your time
[16:52:29] Swadq: If it works, I love you
[16:52:42] Dude-X: frame is a tag so xpath should locate it
[16:52:51] Dude-X: if you have one frame //frame should just work
[16:53:48] Swadq: I can't find that method
[16:53:54] Swadq: What do I need to import?
[16:54:47] Dude-X: findElement(By.xpath('//frame')
[16:55:03] Dude-X: )
[16:55:35] Swadq: I still can't find that method - findElement
[16:57:01] Swadq: Ok, I think I've got it

[17:08:54] Swadq: so*
[17:09:32] ebass`afk: if your using that
[17:10:09] ebass`afk: you can get the webdriver instance and then use the driver.switchTo().frame(yourElement)

[17:49:17] jillio: so follow up question lukeis, if i am using webdriver and want to use InternetExplorer driver, i have to run it in Windows right? But since Windows can only run 1 IE, and if I want to run it in different flavours of IE, is there other way than opting for RC solution ? To be honest I don't even know how RC would work.  Just looking for some guidance.
[17:51:23] lukeis: you should have a few windows boxes with different versions of IE (and multiple at that) and then connect them all (using Grid2) to a hub machine which you send all your requests for starting an IE Driver
[17:51:52] lukeis: and this is not "RC" well... it kinda is, but RC usually implies the "Selenium" class, instead of the WebDriver class
[17:52:50] lukeis: you are using WebDriver right?   WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver(); 
[17:52:51] barancev: in 2.22 with that standalone IEDriverServer you can run multiple instances of IE
[17:53:01] *lukeis isn
[17:53:15] lukeis: 't recommending that till i understand all the nuances :)
[17:54:19] gtailleb has left #selenium
[17:54:33] barancev: but, yes, no matter what browser do you use, it is better to run a single instance

[20:09:24] AutomatedTester: jimevans: his response was the wrong one and tbh its a bit of a crap one
[20:09:40] jimevans: i don't disagree.
[20:10:07] AutomatedTester: the bug is crap, we have all done talks, ON PROJECTORS, we would spot it
[20:10:14] AutomatedTester: *sigh*
[20:10:16] AutomatedTester: ok bbiab
[20:10:24] AutomatedTester: updating my B2G device
[20:10:44] AutomatedTester: well downloading it
[20:10:57] *AutomatedTester is doing book work on my personal laptop
[20:12:03] lukeis: lol... this bug is awesome ;)
[20:12:29] lukeis: i should reply sorry, can't reprouce, my laptop doesn't have a VGA output
[20:15:39] *lukeis <3 users who think their html package is sooo important it can't be handed over to help troubleshoot... i mean it's soo simple to just replace all the displayed text with xxxxxx :-D  anything else is just silly javascript we don't want anyways ;)
[20:17:12] Dude-X: i tried to prep a page for a test case, and i needed the javascript
[20:19:48] lukeis: I meant to imply that javascript isn't usually sooo top secret it can't be shared
[20:20:24] lukeis: unless you invented some fantastic new Javascript thing that you intend to sell to some big company ;)

[20:21:13] lukeis: Dude-X: where's your patch for ExpectedConditions in python?
[20:21:30] Swadq: that will then be pubilcly displayed anyway, lukeis ^
[20:21:40] lukeis: exactly ;)
[20:21:59] lukeis: well.. unless it's behind some pay-wall / sign in
[20:23:00] Swadq: True
[20:23:15] Swadq: But what's the point in it being amazing if you're gonna limit it to 100 or so people?

[21:14:35] jillio: hi guys, is there a workaround to clearing browser cache for IE? I tried doing CTRL F5 in my junit but that does not seem to do the job.  But if I manually clear the browser cache and refresh the page and the page behaved as I expected it.
[21:14:41] mdgreenfield has left #selenium
[21:15:22] jillio: To make sure it is the browser cache, I tried going to another page which uses the same javascript and then going back to my problematic page again and it did retain cached info (which should not appear in the problematic page)

[21:32:50] lukeis: we don't even have FF12 in ci yet :-/
[21:32:56] llaskin: they are goin super fast
[21:34:16] AutomatedTester: super duper fast, no other browser vendor is this fast
[21:34:17] barancev: https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar -- every month
[21:34:19] AutomatedTester: oh wait...
[21:34:34] AutomatedTester: Chromium goes this fast
[21:34:38] barancev: every six weeks
[21:34:41] RossPatterson: Just catching up on today's stream ... love the projector bug :-)

[21:35:26] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: I am about to do the death blow to that bug /cc jimevans
[21:35:26] lukeis: cause they just call it Stable, Beta, Dev... everyone still tacks on version numbers with FF
[21:35:35] Dude-X: does that mean version 20 of chrome is just around the corner?
[21:35:54] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: yea, I think its in canary atm
[21:36:06] AutomatedTester: dev is 19
[21:36:17] Dude-X: chrome 19 is already in stable
[21:36:40] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: in that case 21 is in canary
[21:36:55] Dude-X: i look forward to ff 15

[21:37:02] Dude-X: hopefully they fix that memory leak problem
[21:37:15] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: which memory leak?
[21:37:16] Dude-X: any thing i do with firefox 12 ends up using 2gb real memory
[21:37:34] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: in webdriver?
[21:37:40] Dude-X: no general usage
[21:37:40] AutomatedTester: webdriver has a lot of memory leaks
[21:37:44] Dude-X: it does?
[21:37:50] Dude-X: never noticed since our tests tear down
[21:38:00] Dude-X: well, the test runner terminates
[21:38:05] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: what do you consider "general usage"?
[21:38:22] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: the way i use all my pcs, is i open firefox and leave my pc running 24/7
[21:38:23] *AutomatedTester never goes above 500mb in FIrefox
[21:38:28] Dude-X: i keep open many tabs
[21:38:40] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: I normally have over 30 tabs open
[21:38:52] Dude-X: but at work, i trim it down so that I dont' have to restart it every day
[21:38:52] AutomatedTester: and never have the problems that people claim
[21:39:09] Dude-X: my windows machine has 200 tabs
[21:39:29] AutomatedTester: whats in those 200 tabs?
[21:40:09] barancev: mozillans use a special build with removed memory bugs that are included into the standard distribution
[21:40:37] Dude-X: hmm mostly content websites like say slashdot stories, people's blogs, a few comic strips, a handful of youtube videos
[21:40:49] Dude-X: mostly it's tech content, and news stories
[21:40:57] AutomatedTester: interesting...
[21:41:05] AutomatedTester: Firebug?
[21:41:21] Dude-X: my windows box doesn't use firebug, but i do use session manager, flashblock on my windows machine

[21:42:23] barancev: o, sorry, this is the link to comments, read the article -- http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The-Speedup-Loop.aspx
[21:42:26] AutomatedTester: for the projector bug is "Unfortunately till you do that this bug will not be worked on. If you feel that you will not be able to do this please let us know so we can close it." a good response?
[21:42:49] AutomatedTester: barancev: ^
[21:43:08] barancev: not bad :)
[21:43:23] Dude-X: right now on my macbook pro, ff12 is using 978MB of real memory;i have 8 pinned tabs (gmail, g+, yammer, a few work related wikis and jenkins) + 8 tabs of slashdot, blgos
[21:43:40] Dude-X: it uses sessionmanager and firebug
[21:43:45] Dude-X: no flash is installed
[21:44:00] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: Jenkins has a huge memory lea
[21:44:04] AutomatedTester: leak even
[21:44:09] Dude-X: the webpage?
[21:44:12] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: yea
[21:44:14] barancev: a memory bug is a good thing because when you fix it all перу people love you :) like the speedup loops from this article :)
[21:44:20] Dude-X: like it has bad javascript?
[21:44:21] AutomatedTester: its leaking javascript objects
[21:44:27] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: yup
[21:44:28] Dude-X: interesting
[21:44:32] Dude-X: i'll close it then!
[21:44:46] AutomatedTester: our automation development team is tracking it atm
[21:44:52] *AutomatedTester finds the bug number

[21:45:57] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: ^
[21:46:28] Dude-X: great, i bookmarked that
[21:47:14] Dude-X: closing Jenkins released 200MB of memory
[21:47:16] Dude-X: nice
[21:49:44] AutomatedTester: unfortunately bad websites make browsers look bad :/
[21:50:30] Dude-X: as much as i use chrome, i go back to firefox a lot
[21:51:05] Dude-X: but it's hard to use ff on the mac when it can slow down everything
[21:51:14] Dude-X: on windows i can use 200 tabs with no problem
[21:53:58] AutomatedTester: normally its the other way...
[21:54:02] AutomatedTester: oh well
[21:54:22] AutomatedTester: anyway! peoples I am off
[21:54:27] Dude-X: alright take care
