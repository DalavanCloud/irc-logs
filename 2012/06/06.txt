[00:00:01] Dude-X: it just makes my blood boil when i look at the tests done by the outsource team
[00:00:18] Dude-X: i feel the green monster inside of me roar
[00:00:47] klrmn: green monster == hulk or jealousy?
[00:01:06] Dude-X: hulk
[00:01:17] klrmn: i figured that was the more likely case
[00:01:31] gsnedders: green-eyed is the typical personification jealousy.
[00:02:08] Dude-X: i wish i can tell my coworkers "i am going to stop following the stories for the sprint, and just refactor shitty tests all week"
[00:03:16] lukeis: that doesn't help in the long wrong... point out everything that is wrong and make them redo it... then point out what is wrong with the redo and make them redo it till it's better :)
[00:03:56] Dude-X: i've written style guides, and they follow things to the letter without thinking
[00:04:05] Dude-X: but at least it's improved since then
[00:04:58] Dude-X: perhaps i need to have them read about japanese philosophy about having things look pretty
[00:05:48] Dude-X: when i started on this project, all i did was look at other existing tests, and copied that style; it wasn't hard and my predecessors had pretty good style 
[00:05:55] Dude-X: and they were not even hard core developers
[00:06:53] Dude-X: lukeis: is it a good idiom to click into an input box, then do sendkeys, then click away to a no-op element?
[00:07:14] Dude-X: it seems that i have sleeps in areas where there is a lot of typing
[00:14:35] lukeis: Dude-X: not really... sendKeys does the focus event... usually you should .clear() then .sendKeys() and if you want to blur the element then maybe click on the body or something (i have varying degrees of success doing blur and have to do different things on different pages)
[00:14:51] stephend: lukeis: sorry, was in a meeting, and am off soon, but duly noted, and I'm sure they'll notice :-)
[00:14:52] Dude-X: blur?
[00:15:05] Dude-X: oh i see, make it kick off
[00:15:11] Dude-X: make it fire an event
[00:15:24] lukeis: blur is the event ;)

[00:17:58] Dude-X: sweet i save 4 seconds from a test by taking out a sleep, i put a click after a sendkeys
[00:18:00] Dude-X: that worked well
[00:18:23] Dude-X: let's see if the CI build thinks it's stable
[00:20:17] Dude-X: well i saved 4 seconds but my time is better spent refactoring this UNICODE(pile-of-poo)

[05:50:48] selbot2: ok!
[05:51:40] tunabum: Dude-X: yep... many questionable things are in Selenium ;)
[05:54:22] Dude-X_: a while back i was looking at how the port number was initialized in firefox driver in java; and saw that it pretty much ignored the property :O
[05:54:28] kamoricks: I keep getting "Unable to locate element: {"method":"tag name","selector":"body"}", on pages which clearly have body tags. Any idea why this could be?
[05:55:14] Dude-X_: is it full of ajax or active javascript like jquery?
[05:55:23] Dude-X_: what other details can you impart?
[05:56:11] kamoricks: Uh. Yes, it's very ajax-y, no, it doesn't time out, I'm using selenium-server-2.22 with Firefox 12.
[05:57:17] kamoricks: I've had a lot of similar issues - 2.22 seems to work slightly different with the site than 2.21 did, and my tests keep breaking as a result. Perhaps the tests are simply too fragile.
[05:57:46] Dude-X_: 2.22 does certainly have different characteristics 
[05:58:01] Dude-X_: but i am stuck with 3.6 for now
[05:58:16] kamoricks: 3.6 of what?
[05:58:23] Dude-X_: firefox 3.6
[05:58:40] Dude-X_: my project is using 2.17 and ff3.6 on linux
[05:59:01] Dude-X_: i am testing 2.22 now; i see it as a way of improving the robustness of my tests
[05:59:08] kamoricks: I need it to *work*, not have to redo my entire test suite every time a new version of firefox comes out and we have to make sure we support it.
[05:59:13] Dude-X_: actually it helped expose some weak parts of my test
[05:59:28] Dude-X_: well it's open source, free, evolving, etc
[05:59:53] Dude-X_: and javascript by itself is frought with a lot of indeterminism
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Jun  6 06:00:54 2012]
[06:00:54] Dude-X_: i had one test that was testing huge swaths of invisible stuff in 2.17, 2.22 showed me that i had to add a few functions to expose the thing i was looking at
[06:00:58] kamoricks: Not reassuring, when running tests. Anyway. It's a search for a body tag. It should either succeed or time out.
[06:01:02] tunabum: i haven't come across anything like you're describing kamoricks have a link to a page to reproduce or can share an example html page?
[06:04:34] kamoricks: tunabum: No, sorry. But can you think of any conditions <body> would not load? Only conditions I'm seeing are if the page refreshes before I request it, but that throws a different exception.

[06:13:32] tunabum: awesome :) congrats
[06:13:51] tunabum: now why the f is it 2 hours? ;)
[06:14:00] Dude-X_: we have good coverage
[06:14:12] Dude-X_: and some of it is is the terrible tests written by the outsource team
[06:14:23] kamoricks: tunabum: Can I /msg you the link?
[06:14:30] Dude-X_: they write long tests that test nothing.
[06:14:41] tunabum: heh, i like how sometimes "good coverage" is duplicate coverage
[06:14:52] Dude-X_: i've been told a few times to stop bad mouthing the outsource team
[06:14:59] tunabum: kamoricks: sure... but i'm not going to be online much longer tonight, i can look into it tomorrow
[06:15:16] tunabum: (is also known as lukeis if you find me tomorrow)
[06:15:19] Dude-X_: we do have some "legacy" tests that could be refactored too :D
[06:16:10] Dude-X_: i think i'll get one of the noobs to refactor this awful test
[06:16:21] Dude-X_: it will put hair on their chest
[06:16:51] Dude-X_: it will only give me more grey hairs if i work on it
[06:17:05] Dude-X_: I have deleted tests and started from scratch 
[06:25:09] tunabum: kamoricks: so... i was able to find by tag name "body" for that sample html... likely the JS and CSS that are included (that I don't have access to in your example) are probably influencing it somehow
[06:27:23] kamoricks: tunabum: They... remove the body tag?
[06:29:22] darius__w: can I force selenium server to listen on specified ip address?
[06:30:04] tunabum: kamoricks: i doubt it... but javascript has been known to interfere with selenium before :) (firefox is purely Javascript based)

[06:31:40] kamoricks: tunabum: Oh joy of joys. Would it be more stable with, say, IE?
[06:32:43] kamoricks: My code under test should not interfere with my test case.

[07:23:41] kamoricks: I'm aware of the FAQ stating that "there's no real answer, but an implicit wait should be sufficient", but it's not sufficient, because certain test runs use the old page.

[13:58:34] jimevans: fair enough. just wanted to make sure *someone* among our Mozilla friends are following breakage of FirefoxDriver (java and .net) up in the wake of the Firefox 13 release.
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Jun  6 14:00:26 2012]
[14:00:26] AutomatedTester: jimevans: all I got was "its broken"
[14:00:31] AutomatedTester: do you have any more info
[14:01:10] jimevans: yeah, i do.
[14:02:29] jimevans: so what happens is (as you know), we copy whatever profile into the temp directory, then launch firefox with the -silent switch to clean the profile and attempt to remove the lock file on the profile (.parentlock or parent.lock), which the language bindings poll to wait for it to disappear.
[14:02:37] jimevans: the problem is that it never disappears.
[14:02:55] jimevans: there are three possible problems, i don't know which is correct.
[14:03:53] jimevans: (1) that firefox doesn't respect the XRE_PROFILE_PATH environment variable, (2) the -silent switch doesn't work correctly, or (3) the lock file isn't needed anymore, so it's ignored by firefox.
[14:04:18] AutomatedTester: the python bindings dont poll for the lock file, never have
[14:04:36] jimevans: right. both java and .net do, and always have. :)
[14:05:14] jimevans: i confess that the .net implementation was fairly blindly copied from the java.
[14:05:38] *AutomatedTester will have a look at MozRunner code and see what is done there

[14:06:05] AutomatedTester: thats going to become the driver for Firefox code when we switch to marionette
[14:06:41] jimevans: appreciate you looking into it. i just want to know what the *right* way to point to the custom profile is, and not have firefox think it was unexpectedly killed.
[14:07:12] jimevans: (at least i *think* that's the logic for looking at the lock file)

[14:22:58] jarib: remove the lock file polling, and it should be fine.
[14:23:00] hourback has joined #selenium
[14:23:24] AutomatedTester: jarib: I wanted to make the change and test locally before suggesting that
[14:23:52] jarib: good idea
[14:24:20] AutomatedTester: but I started a clobber build earlier and still waiting...
[14:24:30] jimevans: so does that mean the initial -silent launch of firefox is no longer necessary?
[14:25:04] AutomatedTester: jimevans: python does that
[14:25:12] AutomatedTester: it launches twice
[14:25:33] AutomatedTester: but on the first launch python, and ruby from what jarib says, doesnt check for the lock file
[14:25:47] noahsussman has joined #selenium
[14:25:48] jarib: ruby does -silent as well, AFAIK it's necessary to make sure the profile is valid
[14:26:30] jarib: i'm not sure why the lock file is polled.. should be enough to wait for -silent to exit
[14:26:44] AutomatedTester: thats what I do jarib
[14:27:06] jimevans: just another point of reference, the lock check is actually cased for Windows-only. i think there's a slight delay between the file system *actually* recognizing the file being deleted.
[14:28:10] jimevans: lukeis made a change yesterday trying to fix the issue, but i think it got a bit conflated with the real issue.
[14:29:11] jimevans: (since it's a hassle for most people to actually test on windows)
[14:30:19] jarib: oh, windows only
[14:30:26] *jarib didn't test ruby + FF13 on windows
[14:30:31] jarib: let me try that
[14:30:39] jimevans: heh. i *knew* that'd get through the cracks.
[14:30:55] AutomatedTester: well from what I have heard from the webqa team its working with pure python code
[14:31:03] AutomatedTester: the minute it goes to remote it breaks
[14:31:14] jimevans: aaaaaaaand there go the native events failures.
[14:32:08] AutomatedTester: yay! Firefox built, lets have a gander
[14:32:35] jimevans: for the record, yes, removing the lock check does seem to work for firefox 13
[14:32:41] jimevans: even on windows.
[14:32:54] jarib: right
[14:33:20] jimevans: what threw me is that -silent used to delete that file for you, now it doesn't
[14:33:42] AutomatedTester: jimevans: like I said earlier, that sounds like a bug originally
[14:35:07] jimevans: what does that file do, and how would firefox react to it's being deleted manually?

[14:35:44] AutomatedTester: jimevans: its just to say the profile is in use
[14:36:13] AutomatedTester: if you have 2 instances using it then bad things *could* happen
[14:36:33] AutomatedTester: but if you delete it and one instance uses it, its fine, it will act like normal
[14:37:21] jimevans: so manually deleting it should be fine, if it's actually something that needs deleting.
[14:37:28] jimevans: (which i'm not convinced of)
[14:38:05] AutomatedTester: jimevans: python and ruby dont poll or delete the file
[14:38:17] AutomatedTester: so if we ignore it and poll the process we will be fine
[14:38:55] jimevans: does that hold true for windows too?
[14:39:13] stockton has joined #selenium
[14:39:42] AutomatedTester: jimevans: python doesnt differentiate between platforms in this code
[14:39:42] jimevans: i'd like to think that code wasn't put there for no good reason (prior experience notwithstanding)
[14:40:06] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I wonder if the Java process handling is crap
[14:40:15] AutomatedTester: and this is just a hack
[14:40:34] jarib: my guess it was needed at some point before the ruby/python bindings were made
[14:40:42] jimevans: that may be true. it could be a leftover artifact from an ancient firefox version too.
[14:40:47] jarib: right
[14:40:51] jimevans: (2.x perhaps)
[14:41:18] jimevans: but that's pure speculation on my part
[14:41:24] AutomatedTester: *sigh* I wish I had a SSD
[14:41:34] jimevans: it does make things nice. :)
[14:41:40] AutomatedTester: my HDD is thrashing about and my machine is acting slow
[14:42:02] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: That's just MacOS :-)
[14:42:17] AutomatedTester: supposedly the new MBPs will be announced today
[14:42:22] jimevans: do we have a guide to how to update the native events code for future firefox versions? we really need to be more proactive about that.
[14:42:40] nirvdrum: Even after I had an SSD in my Mac it'd hit swap and thrash like crazy.
[14:42:43] nirvdrum: It just did it faster.
[14:42:56] AutomatedTester: jimevans: all I was given by eranm was a patch for previous updates
[14:43:38] AutomatedTester: wow, running purge has helped
[14:47:31] jimevans: well, let's give this the old college try...
[14:48:19] *AutomatedTester is updating Firefox on his VM
[14:48:28] AutomatedTester: so getting something to eat quickly
[14:49:52] jimevans: so our current firefox version support policy is what, latest esr, n-1, and n where n is the most recent released build?
[14:50:54] *AutomatedTester hopes os
[14:50:56] AutomatedTester: so even
[14:54:35] jimevans: what the hell is the appeal of running things as a windows service?!?!
[14:56:28] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: ^^
[14:57:06] mltolun has left #selenium
[14:57:08] adamgoucher: dunno. the appeal is i'm being paid to figure it out. i just run it as a console job
[14:57:27] jimevans: it's not directed at adamgoucher, per se, i've just had several people mention trying to do it over the last couple of weeks.
[14:58:03] adamgoucher: heh. even if it was, i'm mercenary enough to not care :D
[14:58:35] jimevans: and doing anything where you're trying to send windows messages from a service process (particularly mouse and keyboard messages) is certainly a Bad Idea
[14:59:02] hourback has left #selenium
[14:59:13] AutomatedTester: well running as a service requires a real user who has access do the desktop
[14:59:30] AutomatedTester: anything sort of that and "You are going to have a bad time"
[14:59:48] jimevans: even though Windows makes you *think* it'll be okay because it has that little "allow to interact with the desktop" checkbox, it's still not what services were designed to do.

[15:00:13] AutomatedTester: ahh for crying in a bucket....
[15:01:21] adamgoucher: maybe i'll just use puppet to open a console and run a command.. wonder how i would do that.

[15:04:42] nsussman has joined #selenium
[15:05:10] adamgoucher: jimevans: i dont suppose that the bit about the native apis and services is tucked away in the docs somewhere?
[15:05:25] jimevans: in our docs? no.
[15:05:57] jimevans: there are many threads on msdn's message forum that talk about how it's flat-out dangerous to have services that interact with the desktop.
[15:06:08] jimevans: dangerous == security hole
[15:06:30] jimevans: services run in session 0; end-user processes don't.
[15:08:40] adamgoucher: this sounds like an faq -- dont do it!
[15:08:48] jimevans: "running selenium as a service considered harmful"
[15:09:42] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: but if its Microsoft thing, should we add it to our FAQ?
[15:10:17] adamgoucher: yes. because people are looking for it at the se context. even if its a link that says 'and here is why'
[15:10:41] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: ok but that opens up a can of worms
[15:11:05] AutomatedTester: any time someone wants to do something and its bad for operating system X we need to update our FAQ
[15:11:34] jimevans: i'm guessing the main reason people want to do this is because they want the server to start automatically when the machine starts. there are other mechanisms that windows provides for this.
[15:11:48] adamgoucher: i think that this is a small enough, but common enough, scenario that its not too back a can of worms
[15:12:13] adamgoucher: jimevans: yup. which is why i'm using puppet
[15:12:28] mdgreenfield has joined #selenium
[15:13:29] jimevans: indeed. that's exactly the correct approach.
[15:13:51] jimevans: hmpf. well that didn't work.
[15:14:00] jimevans: let's update the path to the correct one and try again.
[15:15:14] adamgoucher: of course, now i have to figure out the magic manifests for it...
[15:15:52] jimevans: sending an email to the mailing list with simply "bump" in the body is likely to make me *not* want to help you out of spite.
[15:15:52] AutomatedTester: why do you need puppet? to push the server there too?
[15:15:53] jarib: adamgoucher: puppet on windows?
[15:16:09] AutomatedTester: windows is making me sad
[15:16:34] jimevans: AutomatedTester: how come?
[15:16:53] AutomatedTester: my VM cant see my MBP

[16:20:41] jimevans: the confusing bit is there's some 'a1' version numbers there. i'm not sure how important they are.

[17:50:02] Dude-X: i had that happen with 2.17 with FF12; 2.22 fixed the issue with FF12;
[17:50:20] Dude-X: but it makes me wonder if the bindings are loading the native events module even if it's not used

[17:52:52] Dude-X: alright
[17:53:14] jimevans: lukeis: i tested only against .NET, because I didn't change the java bindings to be able to launch ff13.
[17:54:22] dawagner: It would explain why some of the ff configs are timing out on CI

[18:46:23] QAGuy: Dude-X: That's totally up to you ;)
[18:46:26] skiphuffman: And the "capabilities" is Webdriver.firefox with the platform changed.
[18:46:56] QAGuy: He is a friend of mine so I'm asking around as a favor to him
[18:47:06] lukeis: if you're not passing in a profile... then I would guess that there's a problem on the remote system creating the temporary profile
[18:48:33] skiphuffman: So why does it have a problem /every time/ when the test is launched from my test node, but /never/ when launched from my desktop?
[18:48:40] jleyba has joined #selenium
[18:52:51] lukeis: dawagner: so, when the suite runs i see testShouldFollowMetaRedirects fail... but run individually it passes... yay

[18:56:34] lukeis: skiphuffman: so, when you run it from your desktop you're passing in the same parameters you would when launched from the node?
[18:57:58] skiphuffman: Yup.  Running the very same job with the same command line.
[18:58:11] jimevans: dawagner: not to put too fine a point on the matter, but shouldn't the firefox 11 native events tests fail in the CI build? we support versions current (13 at present), current - 1 (12 at present), and last ESR release (10 for now). am i missing something, or does it matter?
[18:59:02] lukeis: we shouldn't make them fail... if they happen to pass I thought that was ok ;)
[18:59:13] lukeis: but we don't care if they fail
[18:59:45] jimevans: that's fine, but i guess i'm wondering what's the point of running them in CI if we know they're going to fail?

[19:23:08] skiphuffman: Actually I don't see where I can pass a parameter like that.  I load the webdriver library into my own code and just call libraries.
[19:23:30] skiphuffman: Is there somewhere else I can set up logging?  Perhaps when I instantiate the selenium webdriver object?
[19:24:03] lukeis: you're not using the standalone-server?

[20:03:38] AutomatedTester: jimevans: wassup mate
[20:04:02] jimevans: i just saw a watir-webdriver email on watir-general that made me sad.
[20:04:19] AutomatedTester: link? you can PM if you want
[20:04:45] jimevans: oh, i'll link to it… https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/watir-general/cT9yaL_UI5s
[20:05:04] AutomatedTester: slow building selenium is slow
[20:05:07] jimevans: it's basically a "we don't block on element click, and i don't like that. boo hoo hoo"

[20:06:09] llaskin: Dear Ben,
[20:06:20] llaskin: We urge you to spend time reading the docs and understand how Watir works.
[20:06:23] llaskin: Sincerely,
[20:06:24] llaskin: Watir
[20:06:53] jeichar has joined #selenium
[20:10:05] jimevans: llaskin: that's great, except that the behavior changed between watir and watir-webdriver. the click() method has different semantics between the two.
[20:10:30] llaskin: i know
[20:10:32] llaskin: i'm just trollin

[20:17:19] skiphuffman: I don't see that that log recorded anything useful.
[20:18:21] jimevans: there's a whole lotta green on the CI server. :D

[20:19:13] *jimevans wishes he could set up an IE6 test environment.
[20:19:40] jleyba: jimevans: tag a version as IE6 supported and move on
[20:19:48] jleyba: that browser is too hold for you to waste resources supporting
[20:20:26] jimevans: jleyba: i don't disagree, but we *do* have tests for it in the CI build, and two of the atoms tests fail on IE6.
[20:20:33] jimevans: i'd just like to figure out why.
[20:21:24] jimevans: and if you can convince simonstewart that we can officially drop IE6 support, i'll gladly do so.
[20:21:59] AutomatedTester: lukeis: so you fixed FF13?
[20:22:38] jimevans: jleyba: however, that does give me a reasonable thing to begin a public dialog about.
[20:22:52] jimevans: here i come, twitter! (and the dev mailing list)
[20:23:43] jleyba: jimevans: I guess this means I'll have to abandon the cause -> http://www.saveie6.com
[20:24:17] jimevans: jleyba: yep.

[20:27:38] jleyba: with the advanced interactions api, if you do a keyDown(SHIFT), does that key stay down until you do keyUP?
[20:27:55] jleyba: (does the keyDown persist across action chains)
[20:28:49] AutomatedTester: kkania: ping
[20:30:49] jimevans: jleyba: i don't think so. i believe it's persisted down for a single chain, and there's an implicit key release when the chain ends. but i'm guessing from mostly faulty memory.
[20:31:27] AutomatedTester: jimevans: is your FF13 working?
[20:31:31] AutomatedTester: with your commit?
[20:31:39] jimevans: AutomatedTester: works a treat.
[20:31:52] jimevans: native events and all.
[20:31:55] AutomatedTester: cool
[20:32:06] *AutomatedTester gives lukeis the evil eye
[20:33:39] AutomatedTester: so can I leave a comment on a bug with "this is an awful bug report" when they have just left the template and not added anything?
[20:35:32] jleyba: I think so
[20:35:38] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i certainly don't have a problem with that.
[20:36:50] lukeis has joined #selenium
[20:37:33] skiphuffman: AutomatedTester,  No, you should try to fix the bug.  I mean you are psicyc, aren't you?
[20:37:52] AutomatedTester: i must be, i worked out what you tried to type :P
[20:38:10] skiphuffman: or perhaps psychic.
[20:38:26] skiphuffman: Come on.  Most of the letters were there.

[23:35:03] tessarakt2: Hey!
[23:35:06] jarib: yo
[23:35:35] tessarakt2: I am trying to use the executeScript function of the FirefoxDriver
[23:35:42] jarib: ok?
[23:36:00] tessarakt2: but I get: "org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: null (WARNING: The server did not provide any stacktrace information)"
[23:36:15] tessarakt2: any idea?
[23:36:23] lukeis: means your script that you sent to execute has a javascript error in it
[23:36:28] jarib: :gist the full stacktrace
[23:36:29] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[23:37:27] tessarakt2: http://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?50979 - that is not really more meaningful than what I just wrote
[23:37:44] tessarakt2: but the hint that the JS has an error is good - so I will look at that
[23:38:40] jarib: the error message really should be better if that's the case
[23:38:57] lukeis: you can quickly see if if you just "try { <your js here> } catch (e) { return e; }"
[23:39:02] lukeis: jarib: yes... i agree
[23:40:56] jarib: if a JS execption is thrown in firefox, the exception should be a JavascriptException and the message should include the JS exception message
[23:41:01] jarib: at least that's what i'm seeing here
[23:42:24] tessarakt2: one moment
[23:43:20] lukeis: jarib: i haven't seen that one bubble up before :)
[23:43:39] tessarakt2: ok, I have to do some more research
[23:43:43] tessarakt2: thanks for now
[23:46:20] lukeis: jimevans: yt?
[23:46:30] jimevans: yes, sir, i am
[23:46:46] jimevans: sorry, wasn't looking at the irc window.
[23:46:51] lukeis: i ran the IE9 failure individually and it passed
[23:46:59] lukeis: running the whole atoms together now
[23:47:07] lukeis: next is IE6 ;)
[23:47:13] lukeis: have you looked at any of them yet?
[23:47:19] jimevans: the IE6 atoms failures are well-known.
[23:47:24] lukeis: k
[23:47:27] lukeis: acceptable then?
[23:47:36] jimevans: yes, quite.
[23:47:47] lukeis: cool and the IE9 one then?
[23:48:20] jimevans: i'm pretty sure it's transient. i've seen it happen spontaneously before, then clear up on the next run
[23:48:43] lukeis: and because late in the evening releases are never a good idea... since everything looks green I'll release first thing in the morning (my time... which is everyone else's afternoon)
[23:49:00] jimevans: i'll be ready.
[23:49:15] jimevans: let's quiesce the code. nobody check anything in!
[23:49:16] jimevans: :)
[23:49:16] lukeis: just double checking, prebuilts checked in?
[23:49:19] tessarakt2: the script is http://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?50981 - it has been copied from an example mentioned here: http://mercenary-code.blogspot.de/2010/05/jscoverage-cobertura-and-selenium.html
[23:49:22] jimevans: not yet.
[23:49:25] jimevans: i need to do that.

[23:49:40] dawagner: And yet I STILL download a gecko every time I build.
[23:49:59] lukeis: you do? that's weird
[23:50:15] jimevans: i'll build the IE prebuilts and check in now.
[23:50:19] jimevans: won't take a second.
[23:50:30] lukeis: cool
[23:51:25] jimevans: which will, of course, trigger a ci rebuild. :)
[23:52:36] lukeis: I'll give myself the evening to review the history and come up with a change log
[23:52:56] jarib: wait, release?
[23:53:13] lukeis: dawagner jarib : i mentioned to jim, i'll reiterate for your benefit, I'll release first thing tomorrow morning (my time 9am PST)
[23:53:29] lukeis: as long as everything stays green ;)
[23:53:37] jarib: dawagner: do the checksums not match the ones in the Rakefile?

[23:54:24] lukeis: this is more the FF13 release... although I'm sure jim wanted to drop the dll's from support, that'll have to wait till 2.24 in java land
