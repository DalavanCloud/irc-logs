[12:26:42] barancev: it's hardcoded
[12:26:55] foolx: damn, so no way of changing it at all?

[13:43:02] foolx: barancev: Basically said, i can reprogramm the whole grid by changing the internal files of the .jar file in any way i want right? The Example of TotalTestRuns seems like very easy task. I'm just curious of how well this will work with future releases of Selenium2. Can i use Grid 2.21.MYOWN with Selenium 2.22.0 Nodes?
[13:44:37] barancev: 1) right, you can redefine almost all
[13:44:54] barancev: 2) you'd better use hub and nodes of the same version
[13:45:44] foolx: so when i want to move to 2.22.0 i should redo the changes to the new .jar again?
[13:47:32] barancev|NotHere: foolx: your own servlets will work, if they don't interact with ะตัะตั existing ones and don't depend on them
[13:48:28] foolx: thanks barancev, will save this task as a jira-ticket for later ;) Many possibilities, but surly nothing i should do before i finished using a good DB and stuff for our TA

[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jun  5 14:00:17 2012]
[14:00:17] Bebe: can anyone confirm it before I run it before I submit the bug 
[14:00:22] Bebe: please 
[14:01:13] jimevans: Bebe: before you do, what happens if you sleep for a short time after the click but before calling driver.window_handles?
[14:01:35] Bebe: same thing 
[14:02:07] Bebe: It's reproducible only on windows
[14:02:11] Evil_Otto has joined #selenium
[14:02:29] Bebe: jimevans  that click should open a popup 
[14:02:41] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[14:03:02] Bebe: but the click is not executed :(]
[14:04:01] Bebe: if I "Manually" click the button the pop up is opes
[14:05:03] jimevans: and what happens if you try it on windows with native events turned off?
[14:06:14] Bebe: stupid question :D  
[14:06:26] Bebe: how do I turn off the native events
[14:06:28] Bebe: ?
[14:06:39] jimevans: in python? i don't know.
[14:06:44] Bebe: :)))
[14:07:02] jimevans: it's usually a capability passed in the desired capabilities at the lowest level.
[14:07:33] jimevans: capabilities['nativeEvents'] = false.
[14:07:46] Bebe: found it http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/py/_modules/selenium/webdriver/firefox/firefox_profile.html#FirefoxProfile.native_events_enabled

[14:30:06] Bebe: barancev ^
[14:30:37] barancev: I see, but I've never seen it before :)
[14:31:30] Bebe: The <nav> tag defines a section of navigation links.
[14:31:50] Bebe: http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_nav.asp
[14:31:59] barancev: it's html5, and I'm old-school :)
[14:32:07] Bebe: :)))
[14:32:13] barancev: element.getLocation() returns wrong result for this element
[14:32:43] Bebe: barancev the click is ok on MAC 
[14:32:47] Bebe: or selenium 2.21
[14:38:24] ebass: if you need to get your click working you could probably just leave out the nav section and not use the greater than sign.
[14:38:43] ebass: div.wrapper a.browserid
[14:38:59] barancev: I know why it does not click
[14:39:11] barancev: it's too high
[14:39:35] barancev: when you click in the center of the element manually -- it's failed
[14:39:42] Bebe: ebass  I got the same result div.wrapper a.browserid
[14:39:49] barancev: its center is about 10-15 pixels above the text
[14:40:15] barancev: and it is overlapped by soe other element
[14:41:41] Bebe: barancev and why is it working with sel 2.21
[14:41:42] Bebe: ?
[14:42:40] barancev: I don't know

[14:52:07] mltolun has left #selenium
[14:52:47] ebass: what version of Selenium are you running?
[14:53:02] bsilverberg: Latest from trunk
[14:54:25] ebass: when firefox starts up can you check to see if the webdriver plugin is installed?
[14:57:23] ebass: if it's installed, can you also check to see if its enabled.
[14:58:39] bsilverberg: Just tried with 9.0.1 with the same results.  How exactly do I check to see if the web driver plugin is installed? I went to Tools -> Add-Ons, then chose the Plugins tab. I don't see anything for Webdriver in there.
[14:59:27] jimevans: bsilverberg: remember that we install the extension in an anonymous profile every time we launch firefox. you shouldn't see it normally.
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jun  5 15:00:13 2012]
[15:00:13] jimevans: you'd need to set a breakpoint in your test code at some time after the browser is launched, and then go navigate to Tools -> Add-Ons in the launched instance of firefox.
[15:00:23] bsilverberg: I am looking in the instance that was started when I ran ./go.  I do see the word "WebDriver" in the lower right-hand corner, so I believe I am looking at the instance using the WebDriver profile
[15:00:43] jimevans: yes, if you see that, then the extension is properly installed.
[15:01:06] n8whnp has joined #selenium
[15:01:13] bsilverberg: even though I don't see it in the plugins dialog?
[15:01:45] ebass: its an add-on...sorry I used to wrong terminology
[15:02:12] ejfudd has joined #selenium
[15:02:43] bsilverberg: Is there a way for me to actually check to see if it's installed, or is it the case that just seeing the word WebDriver means it _is_ installed. I thought maybe that just meant that FF was started with that profile
[15:02:44] jimevans: it should be in the extensions tab
[15:03:01] bsilverberg: There is nothing in the extensions tab
[15:03:48] bsilverberg: I am able to get this working with a simple test that just uses new FirefoxDriver(), so let me try that and see if I see anything in the extensions tab
[15:04:49] n8whnp: Is there any way to tell a remote WebDriver instance to use a specified IP instead of doing DNS resolution?
[15:04:50] bsilverberg: Yes, I do see it then. So it does seem like the extension isn't being loaded.
[15:05:17] jimevans: n8whnp: what do you mean?
[15:05:21] bsilverberg: Any ideas about what I can do to figure out _why_?

[15:05:52] n8whnp: jimevans: in LWP I can set the PeerAddress manually ... so instead of looking up a domain it just connects to a specific IP.
[15:06:04] opapo has joined #selenium
[15:06:06] jimevans: bsilverberg: my knowledge of the firefox driver is surface-level functional at best. :)
[15:06:37] bsilverberg: np jimevans :-)  Perhaps someone else can help?
[15:06:50] n8whnp: jimevans: I am trying to do the same thing w/a remote WebDriver instance. I have not seen anything that suggests this is possible. 
[15:06:52] bsilverberg: It was all working fine a couple of days ago
[15:07:42] jimevans: n8whnp: do you mean from the client-side or the remote server? and i have no idea what LWP is.
[15:08:09] jrock20041: n8whnp: In our suite file we point to our grid by its ip
[15:08:26] bsilverberg: It seems like it must have something to do with the JUnit setup, rather than the driver itself, because if I just use new FirefoxDriver() everything is fine, but when I try to run a test via the test runner, which then uses a default driver instance, that is when it has trouble
[15:08:26] ebass: bsilverberg: have you done anything to your environment recently?
[15:08:51] bsilverberg: Not that I can think of
[15:09:01] n8whnp: LWP is one of Perl's web engines. 
[15:09:16] ebass: what is a defaultdriver?
[15:10:02] bsilverberg: That's just the message it logs when deciding what browser to use "INFO: Providing default driver instance"
[15:10:24] n8whnp: I am randomlly adding a domain which does not resolve to a webserver and then trying to connect that domain via a remote WebDriver. Right now the remote WebDriver attempts to do DNS resolution on the made up domain which fails. I need a way to spoof that DNS resolution. 
[15:11:52] jimevans: n8whnp: i'm still confused, but that's just because i'm basically an idiot. you're trying to connect to the domain how, exactly? by navigating to it with the browser you're driving via webdriver?
[15:12:23] n8whnp: jimevans: yes I want to navigate to the domain with a browser driven by webdriver
[15:12:47] jimevans: and what would happen if you manually tried to navigate to that domain with a manually launched instance of the browser?
[15:12:53] jimevans: that should be your guiding question.
[15:13:21] jimevans: if the browser would fail to navigate manually, you should expect that the browser would fail to connect when driven by webdriver.
[15:13:55] n8whnp: I understand this, in some programmatic browsers I can override this behavior
[15:14:05] ebass: n8whnp:  you can spoof the domain with a host file
[15:14:14] ebass: on the machine that runs the test
[15:14:40] jimevans: n8whnp: webdriver *isn't* a programmatic browser. it drives *actual* browsers. thus you'll see the actual browser behavior.
[15:14:41] ebass: that should point you to the IP address where you need to be @
[15:14:42] nitin__ has joined #selenium
[15:15:04] jimevans: faking the dns resolution would be outside the scope of what webdriver is designed to do.
[15:15:19] jimevans: doesn't mean it couldn't be done. i can think of several ways, but none of them involve webdriver.
[15:15:34] jimevans: a hosts file is one. a programmable proxy is another.
[15:15:45] ebass: bsilverberg: what does the JUnit code to launch the browser look like?
[15:15:58] ebass: can u create a gist for it
[15:16:04] ebass: :gist
[15:16:05] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[15:16:41] jimevans: n8whnp: i know that's not what you wanted to hear, but that's the answer.
[15:17:43] n8whnp: jimevans: I expected that might be the answer, I figured that spoofing domains to use Test servers was such a common action that there might be a way to do it inside webdriver
[15:18:34] bsilverberg: I'm just using one of the existing unit tests for Selenium. I'm trying to run the build to test my changes (to Selenium), and that's when the problem appeared. At this point I'm just trying to run the test testShouldBeAbleToOverrideTheWindowAlertMethod. I've gisted the file at https://gist.github.com/2875277
[15:18:37] jimevans: it's not nearly as common as you think. i usually point to the test environment directly rather than try some overcomplicated dns spoofing.
[15:18:50] jimevans: after all, the URL is just a string.
[15:19:26] bsilverberg: The code that's causing the issue is somewhere in JUnit4TestBase
[15:19:28] ebass: the stack trace is showing a bunch of test classes that seem internal to the selenium build testing.
[15:19:38] bsilverberg: exactly!
[15:20:11] bsilverberg: That is what I am trying to do: build selenium to test my contribution
[15:20:36] ebass: i must have missed that part of your explanation

[15:22:28] bsilverberg: I will try to trace through the code again to see if I can get any closer to the actual problem. I tried that before without success.  I was hoping that maybe it was something obvious that someone here would have a quick solution to, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  I will be back when I (hopefully) have something more specific

[15:24:05] jimevans: n8whnp: patches are always welcome, but i would be willing to bet that one would not be accepted. my opinion is that it's pretty far outside the scope of our library. but i'm far from the final word on the matter. submit a :newissue with the patch attached, and email the developers' mailing list.

[16:17:40] bsilverberg: go clean didn't help
[16:18:03] bsilverberg: here's everything that is in Firefox's error console after the browser starts up: https://gist.github.com/2875604
[16:24:11] barancev: bsilverberg: do you have ipv4 address? I've seen similar behaviour in a pure ipv6 network
[16:24:18] jarib: bsilverberg: any local changes?
[16:24:48] bsilverberg: I believe I have ipv4
[16:25:09] barancev: firefox driver has a restriction (hardcoded) to accept connections from localhost only
[16:25:22] barancev: in ipv6 network it does not work
[16:25:32] bsilverberg: I cannot think of any local changes that would have an impact. If you mean local changes to Selenium itself, I tried testing with a pristine copy from svn and had the same problem
[16:26:19] bsilverberg: it was working a couple of days ago. I am at my home office. I don't think anything could have changed about the network in that time, but then again I don't know much about networking
[16:28:08] bsilverberg: I figure it has to be something that has changed in the past couple of days on my system, but I am not aware of anthing

[16:36:21] bsilverberg: I have tried it on 9.0.1, 11 and 12, all with the same results
[16:36:43] ebass: have you tried looking @ the two files referenced in the error log?
[16:36:52] ebass: to see what is throwing the exceptions
[16:36:59] bsilverberg: Based on some checking suggested by others earlier today, it does look as if the web driver extension is not being installed into FF

[16:37:51] bsilverberg: no ebass. Will check that now
[16:38:03] bsilverberg: correct, I can see that text
[16:38:18] ebass: thats a good indication that the browser add-on is installed
[16:38:37] bsilverberg: but the extension does not appear in the extensions tab, whereas it does when I just use new FirefoxDriver()
[16:38:45] ebass: it should also appear in the list of add-on's or extensions
[16:38:55] bsilverberg: right, and it does not
[16:39:10] ebass: sure, i am not sure how the test classes create firefox driver instances

[16:39:21] ebass: :-D
[16:40:19] jarib: bsilverberg: what OS are you on?
[16:40:33] ebass: and if you can telnet to the fxdriver server port (7055) then thats a good indication that the extension is running

[17:09:20] jimevans: the .net implicit wait problem with chrome is my fault entirely. i assumed (wrongly) that every browser updated their timeout handling to use the single timeouts http endpoint. i was wrong.

[17:30:56] Dude-X: lukeis: however, the way it's written now you would have to write until(lambda d: expectedCondtion.presence_of_element(d, locator)), if you want to write until(expectedConditin.presence_of_element(locator)) we will have to refactor it a bit, 
[17:31:08] jimevans: barancev: i don't care. i still hate the API. it's inelegant, encourages poor coding, and lends itself to misuse.
[17:31:25] lukeis: Dude-X: yeah... i'll have to do that, cause that's what i was planning on doing :)
[17:31:47] Dude-X: to make it simple like i suggested?
[17:32:13] Dude-X: i was thinking of something like this gist:
[17:32:30] lukeis: i was planning on until(ExpectedCondition.presence_of_element(locator*))
[17:32:43] barancev: jimevans: I want to say that migration to WebDriver can be considered a fact of the day
[17:33:01] barancev: almost all new issues are WebDriver ones
[17:33:06] lukeis: s/ExpectedCondition/ExpectedConditions/
[17:33:17] barancev: RC usage goes down
[17:33:32] lukeis: the mailing list has trended significantly in that direction too
[17:34:24] lukeis: it's cool what a year of saying "RC is old and nobody is maintaining it, use WebDriver" will do ;)
[17:35:36] Dude-X: lukeis: https://gist.github.com/2876112
[17:36:04] *jimevans is remarkably grumpy today
[17:37:13] Dude-X: lukeis: i testsed that snippet in python, it seems to work (but not tested in a real webdriver setup)
[17:37:39] lukeis: Dude-X: that's cool, I should probably look into the pythonic way of doing it... cause my original thought was to make each one a Class, that defines the __call__ method :)
[17:37:55] *lukeis is stuck in thinking in python 2.4 ways ;)
[17:37:58] jimevans: does anyone know if the firefox driver still responds to the /:session/timeouts/implicit_wait endpoint?
[17:38:07] Dude-X: lukeis: i thought about doing something with class
[17:38:27] lukeis: jimevans: yes i beleive it does
[17:38:30] Dude-X: just didn't know how to work it iut
[17:38:33] Dude-X: out
[17:38:44] Dude-X: would love to see your approach because it helps me learn
[17:39:02] Dude-X: oh each name is a class object?

[17:41:22] Dude-X: i was going to write jibberish

[17:42:31] lukeis: if you'd like to, i have plenty of other things to do :)
[17:43:24] Dude-X: i like how simple that is, so when you call presence_of_element(*locator) it would create the object, and then pass that object to until, which will call o(self.driver) which well then call _call_
[17:43:45] lukeis: :-D
[17:44:04] Dude-X: conceptually i had the right idea, but i was tired to play with it; i was stuck on functools.partial

[19:00:55] barancev: selenium interacts with the browser over the net
[19:01:38] gsnedders: barancev: Ah, no, nothing that should block that.

[19:04:31] Dude-X: it might be my imagination but it looks like webdriver 2.22 (java) is a lot faster for 3.6
[19:04:39] Dude-X: compared to say 2.17
[19:05:53] ebass: i think maybe he meant the chromedriver-server
[19:06:23] barancev: sorry, I'm not a pythonist, and I need to go, anybody else to help?
[19:06:43] gsnedders: barancev: Right, connecting to it via telnet works fine
[19:07:06] barancev: ok, at least it's working on the browser side

[19:08:58] Dude-X: did you run chromedriver, gsnedders
[19:09:02] ebass: nice bsilverberg

[19:09:32] Dude-X: RossPatterson: heh. in the book, i think the boy knew the computer stuff
[19:09:42] Dude-X: chromedriver doesnt' do anything except listen
[19:09:49] barancev: dawagner should name it "Improperly respect capabilities... "

[19:10:20] bsilverberg: I guess I'll keep the change out in my code for now, and send a note to the dev- list about it.
[19:10:33] bsilverberg: Thanks everyone for your help today

[19:12:07] farlan has left #selenium
[19:12:12] Dude-X: probably send a note to the dev list since it's a 'dev' version
[19:12:32] Dude-X: unless it's broken like when the python remote test was
[19:12:42] gsnedders: Dude-X: Starting ChromeDriver and Chrome myself?
[19:13:36] gsnedders: I mean, the Python code seems to manage to start/connect to ChromeDriver fine, which manages to launch Chrome fine.
[19:13:53] gsnedders: It's just ChromeDriver never manages to connect to Chrome.
[19:14:37] Dude-X: gsnedders: python will start chrome for you, but you have to start chromedriver yourself if you don't tell python where it is
[19:14:44] Dude-X: ah
[19:14:47] Dude-X: and there's no traceback
[19:14:56] Dude-X: ?
[19:15:37] gsnedders: Dude-X: You don't have to tell Python where it is, according to the docs. "If the default is used it assumes the executable is in the $PATH"
[19:15:47] Dude-X: that's good
[19:15:55] Dude-X: and you're right
[19:16:07] Dude-X: let me test it on the mac
[19:16:24] gsnedders: http://pastebin.com/BG49ng3i
[19:17:18] gsnedders: Passing an explicit port doesn't seem to help.
[19:17:21] Dude-X: hmm jim fixed a bug that affected chrome that had to do with implicit waits
[19:17:34] QAGuy has joined #selenium
[19:19:12] Dude-X: hmm it works on my mac
[19:19:23] Dude-X: but calling driver.quit() just hangs
[19:19:34] Dude-X: nope just takes a whiel
[19:20:05] Dude-X: so the only thing i can confirm is that webdriver 2.22 is not broken on the mac
[19:20:23] gsnedders: I suspect the issue is in ChromeDriver
[19:20:32] Dude-X: which version do you have?
[19:20:35] Dude-X: i have 19 i think
[19:20:38] Dude-X: 20 just came out
[19:20:41] gsnedders: 21
[19:21:13] Dude-X: so using version=19.0.1068.0 worked fine for me
[19:23:10] stephend: has anyone dealt with android phones timing out their screen, and shutting down webdriver?
[19:24:21] stephend: retornam: did you just send sometihng to a phone?
[19:24:43] jimevans: Dude-X: my change was .NET only.
[19:24:45] stephend: yikes, wrong channel, my bad
[19:26:56] Dude-X: oh right, i read .cs as .js
[19:27:52] Dude-X: gsnedders: don't know why it's working for you but based on your gist it seems like you have some sort of framework (or is that ipython) running. i just tested on my ubuntu 12.04 box
[19:27:58] Dude-X: and it worked fine
[19:28:06] Dude-X: using chromedriver 20 from may 23

[20:34:36] klrmn: okaythen. I'm experiencing "Unable to bind to locking port 7054 within 45000 ms". My current best guess is that FF13, WindowsXP, and a slow machine aren't conforming to selenium's expected timeout.
[20:36:49] lukeis: klrmn: what version of selenium? you'll need 2.22 to work with FF13

[20:47:57] klrmn: yes, i am using remote webdriver, and something in my stack may be passing in a profile, give me a second to check
[20:50:53] klrmn: looks like a default profile with assume_untrusted_cert_issuer set to False
[20:51:53] lukeis: klrmn: looks like it's busted in 2.22 ... ugh :(   i was able to start it with a local driver instance in python... but remote to the standalone server is busted
[20:52:04] klrmn: ouch!
[20:52:04] lukeis: you'll need to downgrade FF to FF12
[20:52:23] Dude-X: ooh FF13 is a bit prettier
[20:53:03] klrmn: ok. (goes to figure out how to get back versions of FF)
[20:53:24] lukeis: you should be able to download it off mozilla's website
[20:53:25] klrmn: is there an issue logged / will you log an issue / should i log an issue?
[20:54:01] lukeis: i can log one... but it doesn't really need to be logged.. that'll be a blocker for the 2.23 release (and I hold the bacon ;) )

[21:01:40] stephend: it's something we've been dreaming about for ages

[21:01:53] lukeis: that was too jleyba ^
[21:02:10] stephend: we don't yet have a way of programmatically updating, thought with silent/background updates shipping soon in Firefox, we might be like Chrome

[21:03:07] klrmn: i'd kinda like โbrowserver not to be required in mozwebqaโฆeach machine i work with has a different version of FF, and i don't have a grid (yet)
[21:03:09] stephend: I know, tell me about it
[21:03:18] stephend: our stupid focusmanager changes drove my team crazy

[21:05:45] n8whnp has joined #selenium
[21:05:46] stephend: indeed
[21:06:35] ebass: why is that so scary?  Does Chrome do a better job of testing the web?
[21:07:18] Dude-X: lukeis: mozilla keeps a stable rendering API right?
[21:07:23] lukeis: maybe... i've just seem more breakage between ff releases than chrome ones... and FF has a larger user share than chrome does for me
[21:07:43] stephend: I think webkit has more rendering coverage, I dunno
[21:07:47] lukeis: Dude-X: I wouldn't assume anything with a release :)
[21:07:51] ebass: hehe
[21:07:53] stephend: I know we've broken web compat quite a bit before
[21:08:02] stephend: but that was largely before we instituted the rapid-release cycle
[21:08:12] Dude-X: we've been lucky that our webapp is stable with our customers
[21:08:17] ebass: i was going to say as long as you have good coverage for layout rendering then the number of sites tested doesnt matter
[21:08:21] Dude-X: who use firefox
[21:08:38] lukeis: about 1/3 of my users ;)
[21:08:39] Dude-X: we do most of our QA on IE
[21:09:01] Dude-X: our app is used almost evenly in quarters
[21:09:04] gsnedders: ebass: Except most of the interesting cases are how things interact, so coverage isn't in itself that interesting.
[21:09:07] Dude-X: well IE has a slight lead
[21:09:21] stephend: gsnedders: good point
[21:09:30] stephend: DOM methods, events
[21:09:45] gsnedders: stephend: I meant just within layout, yet alone elsewhere.

[21:16:30] lukeis: updating trunk that's 3 months old on a windows xp vm takes FOREVER
[21:16:35] Dude-X: firefox 13 is certainly SPeeDY
[21:16:47] Dude-X: FEEL THE BURN
[21:16:55] lukeis: isn't that available now in ff13?
[21:17:02] *lukeis hasn't read any changelog
[21:17:03] Dude-X: yup
[21:17:23] Dude-X: and apache supports SPDY too
[21:17:25] ebass: is ff13 nice? i havent used it
[21:19:00] Dude-X: it seems snappier
[21:19:20] Dude-X: but that's probably because i just killed office 2008 which had this annoything in the background
[21:20:09] Dude-X: and now office 2008 is gone from my life!
[21:20:29] ebass: so how much faster is SPDY than regular HTTP?
[21:20:37] klrmn: so, i've downgraded to FF12, and i'm still getting the locking port error
[21:20:58] klrmn: possibly related to native events set to true?
[21:20:58] lukeis: klrmn: do you have a firewall? or antivirus running?
[21:21:00] Dude-X: i think 20-30%
[21:21:06] lukeis: klrmn: not likely
[21:21:22] Dude-X: klrmn: native events will give you a DLL/.so/.dylib error
[21:21:35] klrmn: okay then, must not be that =)
[21:22:57] klrmn: windows firewall is running. there is an exception for java
[21:23:43] klrmn: since i'm getting the new session requests on the server, i had assumed that anything the server did would be internal and therefore not contingent on the firewall
[21:26:08] klrmn: the antivirus is also microsoft security essentialsโฆthis is my first time looking at it so i'm not sure what i would be looking for. the history doesn't say anything
[21:27:21] lukeis: make sure the firewall is not blocking ports 7054 or 7055
[21:27:51] ebass: 7054 is the mutex port for FFDriver.
[21:28:39] lukeis: (and it starts counting up by one for each new one you start)
[21:29:06] lukeis: i thought... 
[21:29:12] *lukeis is talking out of my ass again
[21:29:17] klrmn: does it re-use them? XP doesn't apparently allow me to enter ranges =(
[21:29:35] lukeis: just start with opening 7054
[21:29:52] ebass: lol
[21:30:04] Dude-X: firefox 13 is looking good so far; using 600 MB of ram instead of like a gig or two, and web pages are snappy once again
[21:30:13] ebass: i was just digging around the fxdriver code today because i was curious how it worked.
[21:30:22] Dude-X: did you find a bug?
[21:32:50] klrmn: had to restart the server, but opening the ports worked. so, was this in the documentation and i missed it, or where should i document it? =)

[21:37:37] jimevans: klrmn: some of the details of the implementation are available there ^^
[21:38:11] jimevans: particularly in the section concerning "starting firefox"
[21:40:05] lukeis: wiki is for in depth developer details which usually help users figure stuff out... sehq should be a user guide and things like starting firefox should be referenced in Chapter 3: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html
[21:41:03] lukeis: here's the source of it http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/websites/www.seleniumhq.org/src/main/rst/03_webdriver.rst
[21:41:07] jimevans: i don't disagree, but the question was asked, "where is this port stuff documented?" i was answering that question.
[21:41:11] lukeis: :)
[21:41:18] klrmn: *nod*, i was thinking that as a user (rather than a developer), i just want to know that if i'm setting up a standalone-server, i need to open ports 4444, 5555 (ie), 7055-6 (ff) ...
[21:41:34] lukeis: i wasn't trying to disagree with you jim, just explaining for a future potential doc'er ;)
[21:42:10] lukeis: there are too few of us :-D
[21:42:18] klrmn: lukeis: thank you for the link to the source for the user guideโฆit's exactly the information i was fishing for =)
[21:42:24] jimevans: indeed. and i ain't one of you. :D
[21:43:11] ebass: I would put that in some kind of troubleshooting section
[21:43:47] Dude-X: hmm i have an interesting situation, right now in jUnit, when  a webdriver test fails, we call a junit rule to take a snapshot; which is fine and dandy
[21:43:56] Dude-X: except if we call @After or the finally in a try finally
[21:44:34] Dude-X: we get the snapshot of events that occur in a finally block or an @After block
[21:45:14] Dude-X: the try finally situation we can take a snapshot in the except clause
[21:45:39] Dude-X: not sure what to do in the @After (life :p )
[21:50:08] ebass: ive had the same problem before and we just started wrapping our test methods with try/finally statement.
[21:50:31] ebass: because AFAIK there really is no other good way to fix that problem.
[21:52:26] klrmn: ebass: i'm thinking about adding a section to http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html#alternative-back-ends-mixing-webdriver-and-rc-technologies
[21:52:44] ebass: gah...try/catch and we would take a SS then throw the original exception
[21:53:24] ebass: klrmn: is that what you were doing?
[21:53:41] ebass: it seemed to me like your problem was the port was being blocked by a firewall
[21:59:10] lukeis: i think we should add more to that error message... "... Do you have a firewall or antivirus blocking port 7054?" might help too
[21:59:57] ebass: from the wiki, it sounds like the port will change depending on how many instances of firefoxdriver are running.
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jun  5 22:00:19 2012]
[22:00:19] lukeis: that's what i thought...
[22:00:30] ebass: so if you have 3 instances running
[22:00:36] *lukeis has too many things to do to go double check it ;)
[22:00:43] ebass: their locks are on 7054, 7056, and 7058
[22:01:15] ebass: and they are running on 7055, 7057, and 7059
[22:03:32] ebass: ah, nevermind...it should always be 7054 and the drivers figure out their server listening port
[22:06:47] klrmn: i would like to document more about running a selenium server than just the firewall.
[22:07:58] klrmn: like what command line to use if you want to use chrome, the fact that there is a separate IE driver that runs on port 5555, and that you can do -help to get the full list of options
[22:09:21] ebass: yea that would be nice
[22:09:39] ebass: as far as i know there is a separate chrome server too
[22:09:42] klrmn: i am a great believer in "if i had to ask someone about it, it should be documented"
[22:09:54] ebass: which also listens on 5555
[22:10:21] klrmn: i've been running the chrome driver as a flag to the standalone server
[22:10:29] klrmn: i wonder if the ie driver would work the same way

[22:15:44] lukeis: put in one of the many directories that will be shown ;)
[22:15:59] lukeis: (unless you're on windows with python... then do not put it in windows/system32)
[22:22:55] jimevans: well, there goes the firefox auto update
[22:24:54] lukeis: the dotnet bindings might still work... but whatever java is doing to start the process is causing an indefinite hang :-/
[22:25:14] lukeis: so... grid/remote is f*ed
[22:25:53] lukeis: well, i've only tried this on xp thus far... lemme check other OSes
[22:37:47] stackedsax: one other possible issue with chromedriver is if you're running selenium as a windows service
[22:38:02] stackedsax: you need the alternate chrome installer
[22:38:56] klrmn: stackedsax: are you talking to me?
[22:39:43] stackedsax: I guess so โ I just noticed the convo was similar to that piece of knowledge
[22:39:48] jimevans: well, there's a bug in the firefox launch code, at least in .net.
[22:40:41] klrmn: well, sounds like there's even more knowledge to be hadโฆi have no idea how to run selenium as a windows service
[22:40:57] jimevans: klrmn: don't. just don't.
[22:41:19] jimevans: IE in particular reacts very poorly when run in that environment.
[22:41:42] jimevans: stephend: yt?
[22:41:44] stackedsax: jimevans: what do you prefer?
[22:41:53] klrmn: so the extent of the documentation should be "it is not recommended to run selenium as a windows service" =)
[22:42:11] jimevans: run the thing as a regular user. y'know, like your users actually will?
[22:42:17] stackedsax: that's not necessarily my recommendation
[22:42:20] Ardesco has joined #selenium
[22:43:15] jimevans: stackedsax: let me state this as clearly as i possibly can. i do not and will not support anyone attempting to use the IE driver as a windows service.
[22:44:19] jimevans: if someone else wants to take ownership of that particular driver, and then claim to support it, they're welcome to the headaches involved.
[22:44:57] lukeis: fun... trunk on my mac just keeps opening new FF instances...
[22:45:12] jimevans: lukeis: i think i see a problem in the launch code for firefox.
[22:45:54] jimevans: we attempt to clean the anonymous profile, and wait for the profile lock file (.parentlock or parent.lock) to be deleted.
[22:46:03] jimevans: but it never is with firefox 13.
[22:46:11] lukeis: yay
[22:46:25] lukeis: lucky i'm still here... i thought my machine was hosed for a sec
[22:47:02] jimevans: i don't know if that's because ff 13 no longer responds to the XRE_PROFILE_PATH environment variable, or if the lock file is no longer needed, so firefox doesn't clean it up.
[22:47:24] jimevans: or if firefox doesn't respect the -silent switch anymore.
[22:47:54] lukeis: if only we knew some people who worked at mozilla who could help us out ;)
[22:48:02] jimevans: god, i'll be glad when marionette is mainstreamed.
[22:48:11] *lukeis concurs
[22:48:24] jimevans: s/when/if and when/
[22:48:33] jimevans: it's still not a sure thing. there are security concerns.
[22:48:43] stephend: jimevans: yo
[22:48:44] stephend: here
[22:48:46] lukeis: :)
[22:48:48] *stephend reads up
[22:49:15] stephend: gah
[22:49:21] stephend: I always rely on davehunt or automatedtester
[22:49:22] jimevans: yeah.
[22:49:27] stephend: but I can definitely follow up with this
[22:49:29] jimevans: damn brits.
[22:49:34] stephend: they're not back until the 14th
[22:49:37] stephend: well, dave at least
[22:49:46] lukeis: which dave? ;)
[22:49:49] lukeis: heh
[22:49:50] klrmn: wow, i am so unluckyโฆmy copy of the svn repository is rooted at trunk, therefore missing the websites directory entirely =(
[22:49:54] stephend: "holidays" -- which they really mean "vacation"
[22:49:57] stephend: lukeis: hunt
[22:50:20] jimevans: dave burns is around, i think. he's been tweeting today from a meet up.
[22:50:27] stephend: oh, cool
[22:50:31] stephend: just not on IRC
[22:50:35] jimevans: right.
[22:50:35] lukeis: yeah, he came online yesterday
[22:50:41] stephend: so, firefox 13 isn't working with 2.22.0?
[22:50:42] jimevans: maybe catch up with him tomorrow.
[22:50:46] stephend: and the Python driver?
[22:50:51] stephend: or more general?
[22:50:52] lukeis: only with python apparently
[22:50:57] stephend: ok
[22:51:01] lukeis: not via remote though
[22:51:10] lukeis: so java is borked ;)
[22:51:12] jimevans: won't work with remote, because that's java at the back end
[22:51:15] stephend: ah
[22:51:36] jimevans: .net is broked too, because it uses the same algorithm for launching firefox.
[22:51:46] stephend: gah
[22:52:12] lukeis: ruby probably is too, since jarib always does everything java is doing (and some...)
[22:52:37] jimevans: so i've laid out the first hurdle, and the three most probable causes
[22:52:42] jimevans: up above.
[22:53:08] stephend: yep, gotcha
[22:53:11] *stephend will follow-up
[22:53:17] jimevans: yay!
[22:54:29] jimevans: if there happens to be any word today, ping me on twitter or leave me a note via selbot, so i can look into implementations.
[22:54:33] jimevans: but i'm calling it a night.
[22:54:55] jimevans has left #selenium
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jun  5 23:02:44 2012]
[23:02:44] stephend: ok, clue me in
[23:02:49] stephend: the remote thing :-
[23:03:03] stephend: py.test wfm with 13 on mac
[23:03:06] klrmn: i observe that when you click 'check out' on the web version of the selenium repository, you get instructions for how to check out trunk, which means someone trying to help with the website s or wiki wouldn't be able to find it, and might get frusterated and give up
[23:03:11] stephend: and 2.22
[23:03:42] klrmn: i think it has to do with selenium server running on windows rather than mac
[23:04:36] stephend: ah
[23:04:42] lukeis: stephend: against win xp it hangs indefinitely
[23:07:02] jarib: lukeis: actually, ruby doesn't watch the lock file
[23:07:24] lukeis: coolio :)
[23:07:32] jarib: not sure why exactly
[23:09:05] lukeis: well, 2.22 on a mac works, but trunk doesn't ;) w00t
[23:09:14] jarib: interesting
[23:09:17] lukeis: for FF13 that is
[23:09:24] jarib: i just pushed 2.22.2 for ruby from trunk earlier today.
[23:09:42] jarib: is it mac-specific?
[23:09:46] lukeis: i don't know about ruby... but it's the java i'm testing
[23:09:46] *jarib can only test on linux atm
[23:09:50] jarib: k
[23:11:15] klrmn: this statement looks like it's ready for a re-vamp "Firefox Driver is capable of being run and is tested on Windows, Mac, Linux. 
[23:11:16] klrmn: Currently on versions 3.0, 3.6, 5, 6, 7, and 8"
[23:11:47] klrmn: iirc, the current answer is 3.6 and 7-12
[23:12:10] lukeis: 3.6, 10-12
[23:12:30] lukeis: 2.23 will / should be 3.6, 10-13
[23:12:47] Dude-X: simon said officially 3.6, 10, and latest-1, latest
[23:12:49] lukeis: well, possibly without 11
[23:12:55] lukeis: yep
[23:13:00] klrmn: thank youโฆgiven how far out of date it is, perhaps saying 3.6 and 10+ (support for the most recent version may be unreliable)
[23:13:19] jarib: 2.22.2 ruby (from trunk today) works fine on 13 on Linux
[23:13:40] lukeis: that won't be accurate in a couple of months... 11,12 won't be supported :)
[23:14:03] jarib: yeah, saying we support "latest" may in reality be a bit ambitious...
[23:14:04] lukeis: jarib: i'm having more trouble on windows... 
[23:14:14] jarib: for native events we'll always lag behind
[23:14:21] jarib: lukeis: with ruby and 2.22.2?
[23:14:35] *lukeis doesn't have ruby on a windows box to test
[23:14:48] lukeis: but i'll guess it will work
[23:14:48] stephend: klrmn: lukeis: can either of you get me a screencast?
[23:15:05] jarib: bsilverberg was having trouble with trunk java earlier today, but that was on older firefox as well.
[23:15:09] stephend: I have a mac-native run here which shows 2.22.x is working fine on 13, but want to compare
[23:15:10] Dude-X: latest at time of release :D
[23:15:11] stackedsax: jimevans: I hear your stern words against Windows services, but I think there needs to be a little more help for people on exactly what they SHOULD do as a scalable solution.
[23:15:45] stackedsax: there is no set of scripts that anyone provides to say, "here, try this"
[23:16:06] lukeis: stephend: on win xp?  ... it's literally a hang after the remote... last line in the standalone server output is "Executing: [new session: .... " 
[23:16:24] stephend: yeah, or at least just the command-line you're using
[23:16:33] *stephend wants to give them as much info as possible
[23:16:40] klrmn: stephend: i turned out to be running into blocked ports before getting to the current errorโฆi've rolled-back to FF12 since
[23:17:07] stephend: I'm just running with (c9b22c9a66958b08)host-4-123:tests moco$ py.test --driver=firefox --baseurl=https://crash-stats.allizom.org
[23:17:21] stackedsax: ah, jimevans gone
[23:17:32] stackedsax: :help
[23:17:41] klrmn: i ran it with -D<chrome driver stuff> -D<native events stuff>
[23:17:58] lukeis: stephend: start a standalone server; python -e "from selenium import webdriver as w; d = w.Remote('http://localhost:4444/wd/hub', w.DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX)"   <- sits indefinetly with nothing launch on win xp
[23:18:04] stephend: thanks, that wfm
[23:18:06] *stephend sends email
[23:18:14] stephend: I'm the resident non-geek
[23:18:24] stackedsax: :note jimevans I hear your stern words against Windows services, but I think there needs to be a little more help for people on exactly what they SHOULD do as a scalable solution.
[23:18:25] selbot2: ok!
[23:18:49] lukeis: stackedsax: use Grid with it in the system path? :)
[23:20:53] stephend: sent
[23:21:02] stephend: here's hoping that they're not completely on vacation :-)
[23:22:52] *lukeis would love to launch 2.23 ... i have too little time and too little environments to test this thing out ;)
[23:24:29] stackedsax: lukeis: not sure what you mean.  fwiw, I've been running everything as a service reasonably happily for a couple yearsโฆ. our grids have a between 75-400 nodes attached.
[23:25:23] lukeis: yeah, the grid node which is your standalone server is in the service... ie driver server is spawned as a process from that server, so you shouldn't need ie driver server as a service on your box
[23:25:30] stackedsax: the hubs are on linux, though.
[23:26:24] lukeis: s/ie driver server/ie driver standalone executeable/
[23:26:25] lukeis:  ;)
[23:26:59] lukeis: ok... nm on that... darn you jim on your file naming
[23:27:00] stackedsax: yes indeed.  But I think jimevans is warning about the complications of which user the service actually runs as.
[23:27:24] lukeis: ah... you don't just run as an admin? ;)
[23:27:43] stackedsax: although I'm logged in as one user, I think the windows service runs as someting else โ hence the problem with chromedriver
[23:28:08] lukeis: esh
[23:28:55] lukeis: :note dawagner Firefox is all sorts of fun in trunk right now. after you look at what bob emailed the dev list about, let's see if you can get trunk running on win xp FF13 :-D
[23:28:56] selbot2: ok!
[23:29:33] lukeis: stephend: that's my email ^ ;)
[23:40:12] lukeis: stephend: btw... i just re-read what I put and ... it's python -c .... (instead of -e) ... but i'm sure they'll get the point
[23:41:45] klrmn: most interesting
[23:42:24] klrmn: i had been waiting for davehunt to be around to troubleshoot why pytest-mozwebqa was having trouble requesting a remote IE instance
[23:42:34] klrmn: but this raises BadStatusLine too
[23:42:37] klrmn: python -c "from selenium import webdriver as w; d = w.Remote('http://10.0.1.13:5555/wd/hub', w.DesiredCapabilities.INTERNETEXPLORER)"
[23:47:49] lukeis: klrmn: that works for me :)
[23:51:32] klrmn: gist of stacktrace https://gist.github.com/2878626 โฆ i'm obviously still doing something wrong
[23:52:19] Dude-X: klrmn: look at the stacktrace on the node/server
[23:52:24] Dude-X: that gives you a hint
[23:52:54] klrmn: ya mean the fact that there wasn't one? =)
[23:54:07] Dude-X: oh
[23:54:58] klrmn: it does work nice and pretty when i put the IEServerDriver on the PATH
[23:55:25] Dude-X: 2.22 kind of requires the ieserver now
[23:55:49] Dude-X: ieserver is better anyway since a bug won't take down selenium server
[23:56:01] Dude-X: that is a crashing bug
[23:57:21] lukeis: it's not technically required... it'll give a warning and fall back to the old one
[23:57:22] klrmn: better than what option?
[23:57:40] Dude-X: having the server used it's internal IE dll
[23:58:16] lukeis: just tried it and seems default will fall back to the dll (with that python remote command at least)
[23:59:21] Dude-X: ok
