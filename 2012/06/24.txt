[17:44:22] Dude-X_: oh and the most important factor is having native events enabled.

[20:21:29] selbot2: 03simon.m.stewart half a minute ago - SimonStewart: Move alert configuration out of the firefox profile and into the desired capabilities: this sort of thing isn't specific to firefox. In the process, move the modal specific code out of the dumping ground that is utils.js and into modals.js, which feels like a more logical place.

[20:50:54] b0rsuk: Hello, I'm getting ElementNotVisibleException (Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with).
[20:51:01] b0rsuk: How do I deal with that ?
[20:51:24] b0rsuk: The element is the password box on this page: https://www.pracuj.pl/mojPracuj/Login
[20:52:11] Dude-X_: b0rsuk, taking a look now...
[20:52:51] Dude-X_: the html does say "display: none" according to firebug
[20:52:59] Dude-X_: but that may not be the issue
[20:53:03] Dude-X_: give me a second while i play with t
[20:54:09] Dude-X_: are you locating on this element: input#PasswordPlaceholder
[20:56:56] Dude-X_: b0rsuk, using that css selector that should work
[20:57:13] Dude-X_: only side effect is that it doesn't hide the password if native events is not enabled...

[21:02:03] jibay has joined #selenium
[21:06:21] b0rsuk: Actually, I've been trying to use the thing with id="Password", not "PasswordPlaceholder".
[21:09:09] Dude-X_: password is invisible
[21:09:36] Dude-X_: the element with PasswordPlaceholder is not
[21:14:59] b0rsuk: Dude-X_: I'm doing inputElement = driver.find_element_by_css_selector('input#PasswordPlaceholder')
[21:15:21] b0rsuk: and then inputElement.send_keys(password)
[21:15:32] Dude-X_: first do .clear()
[21:15:39] Dude-X_: that doesn't work for you?
[21:15:50] Dude-X_: well you know what, i haven't tried inputting a username :P
[21:17:24] Dude-X_: b0rsuk, what also i did differently too
[21:17:35] Dude-X_: instead of assigning to a variable
[21:17:40] Dude-X_: i relocate the variable
[21:18:00] Dude-X_: driver.find_element_by_css_selector('input#PasswordPlaceholder').click()
[21:18:03] Dude-X_: driver.find_element_by_css_selector('input#PasswordPlaceholder').clear()
[21:18:11] Dude-X_: driver.find_element_by_css_selector('input#PasswordPlaceholder').send_keys(password)
[21:18:56] b0rsuk: Hmm, click first. :-)
[21:20:26] Dude-X_: you're using the python client in what OS?
[21:20:27] b0rsuk: And does it work for you ? I mean, do you get a message different than "Uzupe≈Çnij pole Has≈Ço" ? That's a message about password field being empty.
[21:20:36] b0rsuk: Debian Linux
[21:20:48] Dude-X_: python client enables native events by default
[21:20:57] Dude-X_: so make sure you click on input boxes before typing
[21:21:04] b0rsuk: Wait a second, I'll paste my code. Password and login are from an external file so no worries.
[21:21:11] Dude-X_: that's fine
[21:21:31] Dude-X_: native events not enabled by default in mac
[21:24:21] b0rsuk: The message you should be trying to get: "    Niepoprawne has≈Ço albo email.
[21:25:36] Dude-X_: i'll have to see your code
[21:25:47] b0rsuk: http://pastebin.com/h8F5gYEm
[21:26:15] b0rsuk: It expects a file 'login' in the same directory. The first line should be an email, the second the password.
[21:27:18] Dude-X_: you need to click on the username email field first
[21:29:01] Dude-X_: and to get that message you need to find the element that contains the text
[21:29:15] b0rsuk: But the email (username) bit works, it's filled in properly. Anyway, I added the line right after "find element by id", and I still get the exception.
[21:30:21] b0rsuk: hmm.
[21:30:53] Dude-X_: then do another web driver wait; WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(lambda i: password.is_displayed())
[21:33:43] b0rsuk: what is password in your line ?
[21:34:04] Dude-X_: password has d.find_element_by_id('PasswordPlaceholder')
[21:34:34] Dude-X_: or it could be css selector input#PasswordPlaceholder
[21:34:52] b0rsuk: Also, where do I find a full reference of functions and methods ? I'm using the 'Documentation' link from the Selenium homepage, but it's a serries of examples.
[21:35:02] Dude-X_: :apidocs

[21:35:45] Dude-X_: here's some general advice before I go
[21:36:10] Dude-X_: for every web page create a page object, so for example the login page would look something like this
[21:36:22] Dude-X_: class LoginPage(object):
[21:36:37] b0rsuk: Why should I ?
[21:36:45] Dude-X_: are you writing a one off script?
[21:36:54] Dude-X_: or a repeatable test
[21:37:01] testingb0t1 has joined #selenium
[21:37:14] b0rsuk: I'm just learning. I don't know how big it will end up.
[21:37:16] Dude-X_: because it helps organize your code into something maintaianble
[21:37:55] Dude-X_: treat the actions you want to do, as you would a real web browser
[21:38:28] Dude-X_: you wouldn't just start typing into the email field you would click first (some websites might use javascript to bring focus to the input field, but you can't rely on that because web driver is faster than a human being)
[21:38:52] Dude-X_: after every click, you may want to wait for some result to occur
[21:39:02] Dude-X_: then you can move on to the next action
[21:39:14] Dude-X_: alright i'm afk
[21:39:19] b0rsuk: But isn't a class for every page an overkill ?
[21:40:14] b0rsuk: Eh :-(. For every field, I do: 1) assign to a variable 2) click 3) clear 4) send. And I still get ElementNotVisibleException.
[21:42:58] b0rsuk: Anyway, thanks for long term advice. I'm applying for a web app tester position, and I would need to write repeatable tests.
