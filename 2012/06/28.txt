[14:47:09] Dude-X_: Parabola, java.util.URLEncoder
[14:47:48] Dude-X_: you may take the string you expect and encode it, then all get URL
[14:47:52] Dude-X_: then do the comparison elsewhere
[14:48:16] Parabola: that seems more complicated than what I've currently got. may I ask why you recommend that way?
[14:49:39] Dude-X_: say that you're looking for "A boy and his dog" with URLEncoder, you'll get "A+boy+and+his+dog", and then you can do something like driver.getCurrentUrl().contains() or .endswith()
[14:49:52] Dude-X_: but on the other hand I don't know what you're testing
[14:50:37] Parabola: Oh I gotcha
[14:51:17] eanxgeek has joined #selenium
[14:51:52] Dude-X_: also reduce the calls to getCurrentUrl, that's "slow", get it once store it in a string variable, then do all the comparisons you like

[15:01:57] Dude-X_: yeah

[15:04:20] jimevans: do we happen to have any *sigh* nuget users on the channel at the moment?
[15:04:52] Parabola: Dude-X_: so the URL being reported on IE and FF is the initial BRANDS_PAGE url, but the screenshot shows the page you get after you click the EMI Yoshi link
[15:05:05] Parabola: on chrome (18 and 20) it works as expected
[15:07:05] mdgreenfield has joined #selenium
[15:07:12] dawagner: benadderson: Are you guys using nuget these days? ^^
[15:07:18] mdgreenfield has left #selenium
[15:07:32] Dude-X_: Parabola, it is usually my pattern that after a click, I have a wait for new page to load method
[15:08:06] Dude-X_: or wait for some element to appear or some javascript (usually jQuery.active) to equal a value
[15:08:55] Parabola: Dude-X_: may I see said method? I have an implicit wait on all drivers, and i added a thread.sleep that didnt work
[15:09:26] Dude-X_: i don't use implicit waits
[15:09:42] Dude-X_: i only use explicit waits, buuuut most of my calls are wrapped with web driver waits anyway
[15:10:41] Dude-X_: web driver wait internally uses a thread.sleep; 
[15:10:58] Dude-X_: usually if a sleep doesn't work, it means you have to try a different element to wait on
[15:13:41] Parabola: alright
[15:13:49] Parabola: do you think the issue could be the try block?
[15:15:29] benadderson: dawagner: yes we are, why?
[15:16:02] Dude-X_: Parabola, no the try block seems fine
[15:16:05] dawagner: jimevans: benadderson is a *sigh* nuget user :)
[15:16:18] Dude-X_: though like i said, i would call getCurrnetURL once in that if comparison

[15:16:27] jimevans: hi benadderson
[15:16:35] benadderson: hi jimevans
[15:16:57] Parabola: Dude-X_: thank you sir :)
[15:16:57] jimevans: can you do a quick test for me?
[15:17:03] benadderson: sure thing
[15:17:04] Parabola: i'll let you know if i figure it out
[15:17:14] opapo has joined #selenium
[15:17:27] Dude-X_: Parabola, there are times when you want to repeat driver calls, say that clicking on a password box changes the very element itself, then i would do driver.findElement again 
[15:17:34] jimevans: benadderson: i'm assuming your projects that use webdriver don't also use json.net.
[15:18:37] benadderson: jimevans: I'm pretty sure they don't, but let me just double check
[15:20:56] farlan has joined #selenium
[15:21:24] benadderson: jimevans: nope, grepping the solution for json simply returns the Newtonsoft.json entry in the packages.config
[15:24:07] jimevans: not using nuget myself, how difficult would it be to set up a quick-and-dirty project that uses nuget, has dependencies on Selenium.WebDriver and Json.NET, which attempts to run a simple google test? I suspect this will fail spectacularly, but i want to see what the error message is.
[15:24:31] benadderson: should only take a few minutes
[15:24:35] benadderson: I'll give it a bash now
[15:24:49] jimevans: thanks, mate.
[15:27:23] Bebe has joined #selenium
[15:29:30] benadderson: jimevans: The NuGet package manager in VS prevents me from adding the latest versions of Selenium.WebDriver and Newtonsoft.Json
[15:29:44] benadderson: Was that the stage at which you expected the error?
[15:30:19] benadderson: whichever way round I attempt to add them, I get an error
[15:31:05] sirrobert has joined #selenium
[15:31:10] jimevans: really. I would've expected a compile time error perhaps, but not at add-reference time.
[15:32:21] jimevans: i'm going to have to break down and install the *sigh* nuget integration i suppose and try to see for myself if i can replicate the experience others are having.
[15:32:49] brokenthumbs has joined #selenium
[15:32:52] benadderson: So if I add WebDriver first (and hence Newtonsoft.json 4.5.1), the action of adding Newtonsoft.Json latest attempts to upgrade the existing reference. It then complains that "Unable to find a version of Selenium.WebDriver that is compatible with Newtonsoft.Json 4.5.7"

[15:34:09] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[15:34:13] jimevans: so the tool doesn't do the assembly binding redirects like they claim they should do.
[15:34:16] jimevans: interesting.
[15:34:44] jimevans: see, we have a fundamental issue with webdriver and nuget.
[15:35:06] Parabola: Dude-X_: made some headway, now it just fails on firefox :)
[15:35:17] sirrobert: dawagner: https://gist.github.com/3011715
[15:35:23] jimevans: and it all boils down to assemblies with strong names.
[15:35:24] dawagner: jimevans: We could remove JSON from the JSON Wire Protocol, and create our own encoding which couldn't conflict with anything else!
[15:35:26] Dude-X_: Parabola, maybe add a pause
[15:35:41] jimevans: dawagner: gaah!
[15:36:35] dawagner: I vote we call it Jason, and shorten it to Json when writing, so we don't have to update our language
[15:36:45] Parabola: haha
[15:36:51] jimevans: dawagner: i know! we could encode everything as xml! :-P

[15:39:34] sirrobert: any pointers on resolving the "Driver info: driver.version: unknown" issue? (https://gist.github.com/3011715)
[15:39:38] jimevans: i don't have a problem with json. it's even a good solution for our purposes, i think. this is purely a packaging issue
[15:39:50] jimevans: and only a problem in .NET.
[15:39:53] dawagner: sirrobert: I'm just having a look through the code at your revision :)
[15:40:00] sirrobert: ok, thanks =)
[15:40:27] sirrobert: I'm also very ok changing to some other revision or any other structural change =)
[15:41:09] sirrobert: just trying to write a language binding.
[15:41:31] dawagner: What language?
[15:41:34] sirrobert: perl6

[15:44:23] dawagner: (Incidentally, is perl6 ever going to be, you know, released?)
[15:44:42] dawagner: Your POST body should read:
[15:44:50] sirrobert: "released" means something different for a spec language than for a non-spec language =)
[15:44:55] dawagner: {"desiredCapabilities":{"platform":"ANY","browserName":"firefox"}}
[15:44:55] sirrobert: It's already released
[15:44:58] dawagner: I believe it may currently read:

[15:46:50] dawagner: If you grab the java source
[15:47:01] sirrobert: ah, ok
[15:47:03] dawagner: And add a logging line around line 290
[15:47:09] dawagner: And execute your command in java
[15:47:19] sirrobert: excellent, thanks
[15:48:24] dawagner: If you wanted to create a patch for https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol which added sample JSON, I'm sure we'd be happy to commit it :)
[15:48:37] dawagner: (Note that that file is generated by $TRUNK/wire.py)
[15:48:41] sirrobert: fair enough =)
[15:51:19] benadderson: jimevans: If I don't use NuGet to add the reference to Newtonsoft.Json 4.5.7, the "Google for cheese" test compiles and runs just fine
[15:52:48] jimevans: benadderson: i'd expect that. the problem people are experiencing is when they have a (version unbounded) nuget reference to the Newtonsoft json library and a nuget reference to webdriver.
[15:52:57] jimevans: i don't know how they get into that state, but they do.
[15:53:09] barancev: dawagner: it view of the fact that we move all initialization to capabilities, what do you think about ChromeDriver -- why ChromeDriver(Capabilities capabilities) constructor is deprecated?

[15:55:40] dawagner: barancev: We should have that discussion with Jason and Ken :) I think both should be supported, and they should interoperate smoothly
[15:56:00] benadderson: jimevans: It certainly seems like the tooling should be preventing that from occurring, given my experience just now

[16:13:08] jimevans: the particularly interesting bit is in Element.cpp where we call the javascript element.scrollIntoView(). we now give the user a choice whether to pass true or false into that function call. firefox driver gives the user no such option.
[16:13:11] barancev: they are skipped in sauce env with the comment // This test requires a window manager on Linux, and Sauce currently doesn't have one

[16:17:48] dawagner: jimevans: Why the new capability?
[16:19:11] jimevans: path of least resistance. websites often have absolute-positioned elements at the top or bottom, bot not usually both. for clicking elements that might be scrolled underneath the absolute-positioned elements, i wanted to give the user the choice which scrolling model to use.

[16:22:14] dawagner: jimevans: I have a patch sitting on my machine which does the full computation of where on the screen is hidden by floating elements, and does proper scrolling accordingly
[16:22:28] dawagner: Unfortunately, the checks are pretty expensive, because they involve iterating over the whole DOM
[16:22:55] jimevans: i'd guess they would be expensive.
[16:23:29] jimevans: i'm guessing the scroll behavior switch solves the 80% case, which is why i implemented it.

[16:44:43] lukeis: only if that style is defined in the markup
[16:44:49] Dude-X_: yeah that^
[16:45:24] jimevans: "defined in the markup" meaning what, exactly?
[16:45:30] lukeis: in the html source
[16:45:53] lukeis: <div style="display:inline-block; color:red">jim's cool</div>

[16:47:48] kallisti: lukeis: no computed styles?
[16:48:32] lukeis: that would infer a css definition and thus a selector in the css file that hopefully you could re-use in some way
[16:48:50] AutomatedTester: lukeis: you free for lunch today?
[16:48:55] lukeis: AutomatedTester: that i am
[16:49:01] AutomatedTester: cool
[16:49:14] AutomatedTester: you, me, admc, and possibly 2 others
[16:49:16] lukeis: kallisti: the only way to really do a computed style is to use the Javascript Executor
[16:49:20] AutomatedTester: and santi
[16:49:22] lukeis: cool :)
[16:49:35] kallisti: hm, I see. that's odd.
[16:49:40] kallisti: everything else seems to work with the current DOM.
[16:49:56] *lukeis would need to test it out if that were true
[16:50:03] *lukeis can do a simple check
[16:50:23] Dude-X_: what does element.getCSSProperty() do
[16:50:36] AutomatedTester: Dude-X_: it returns a css property
[16:50:39] AutomatedTester: :apidocs

[16:51:32] Dude-X_: which is not a computed style?
[16:51:51] Dude-X_: ah right, i think i know the difference
[16:52:26] lukeis: kallisti: doesn't appear that it works from my simple test
[16:53:00] kallisti: perhaps I misunderstand what "computed style" means?
[16:53:47] kallisti: or I haven't had a situation occur where I need to check CSS properties and the computed style differs from the static style.
[16:54:19] kallisti: lukeis: also, what browser?
[16:54:26] kallisti: IIRC IE doesn't do computed styles at all.
[16:55:13] dawagner: It should resolve the current effective/computed style of the element

[17:42:01] nirvdrum: It is.  It means reducing the value of something over time.

[19:03:07] AutomatedTester: ok, how does your site work on Mobile?
[19:03:13] Chuckleteeth: in my case, the default is to bind to top, so every single link not immediately visible will scroll such that the navbar covers it up

[19:21:16] evilempire1: use the PHPunit Extension  (http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.1/en/selenium.html )
[19:21:16] evilempire1: or one of the options offered at  the selenium website. https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver 
[19:21:16] evilempire1: Not sure of the up and downsides.  The phpunit extension allows me directly to use the exports from the IDE. 
[19:21:16] evilempire1: However Documentaiton talks of "incomplete" support for Webdriver but doesnt specify this any further
[19:21:16] evilempire1: Adam Goucher's Element-34 indicates that it allows nearly complete  support though I had problems getting the IDE exports to run at all and  if i understood it correclty i need to modify the IDE exports.

[19:26:34] detronizator: Someone should tell the "Brackets" people that Cloud9 hs burned them big time
[19:26:54] Chuckleteeth: i didn't know firefox exposed that sorta thing
[19:27:00] detronizator: AutomatedTester: yep - that I guess it's the main idea
[19:27:01] detronizator: :)
[19:27:48] AutomatedTester: Chuckleteeth: a lot of Firefox is pure JS
[19:28:24] Chuckleteeth: i hate js : (
[19:29:21] AutomatedTester: Chuckleteeth: it is the language of the web
[19:29:30] Chuckleteeth: an unfortunate truth
[19:30:04] AutomatedTester: what is to hate? I personally like it as a language
[19:30:37] andreastt: It has its oddities.
[19:30:47] Chuckleteeth: well maybe i need a proper ide or something but there is no intellisense since everything is so dynamic
[19:31:02] Chuckleteeth: ive had so many problems just because of a type in a varaible i was using
[19:31:04] eanxgeek has joined #selenium
[19:31:12] Chuckleteeth: thats probably my main gripe
[19:31:32] lukeis: it all depends on what engine is running it... to know what is available <- what I always struggle with :)
[19:31:34] santiycr has joined #selenium
[19:32:26] Chuckleteeth: yeah... i mean it can't know everything...its okay when you are debugging it because then there is context...but just coding it out is aweful for me
[19:33:00] lukeis: and documentation is horrid... most people only know things cause someone else blogged about it... and they know about it because they cracked open said engine to inspect what was available
[19:33:58] Chuckleteeth: this is gonna take a long time for me to figure out

[19:46:01] drnikki has joined #selenium
[19:46:08] evilempire1: Hi according to my research I can either
[19:46:08] evilempire1: use the PHPunit Extension  (http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.1/en/selenium.html )
[19:46:08] evilempire1: or one of the options offered at  the selenium website. https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver 
[19:46:08] evilempire1: Not sure of the up and downsides.  The phpunit extension allows me directly to use the exports from the IDE. 
[19:46:08] evilempire1: However Documentaiton talks of "incomplete" support for Webdriver but doesnt specify this any further
[19:46:08] evilempire1: Adam Goucher's Element-34 indicates that it allows nearly complete  support though I had problems getting the IDE exports to run at all and  if i understood it correclty i need to modify the IDE exports.
[19:46:08] evilempire1: Any further Insights would be welcom thanks.
[19:47:06] ian_mac has joined #selenium
[19:47:13] AutomatedTester: how do I tell grep to ignore directories?
[19:47:52] Chuckleteeth: AutomatedTester: so you are using google closure library to scroll the min amount into view for a container
[19:48:03] Chuckleteeth: it has an option to 'center' the element in the container
[19:48:15] Chuckleteeth: this would be a differant behaviour then the ieDriver bind to top and bottom
[19:48:28] AutomatedTester: Chuckleteeth: Possibly
[19:48:49] *AutomatedTester hasnt looked at that code in awhile
[19:48:56] andreastt: AutomatedTester: That's a bit hard if you want to recurse.
[19:49:27] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I want to grep with recurse but ignore .svn directories
[19:49:29] freeone3000 has joined #selenium
[19:49:30] andreastt: At least if you want to ignore all directories.
[19:49:37] andreastt: Ah, that's easy.
[19:49:40] andreastt: Use ack. (-;
[19:49:52] AutomatedTester: ok, how do I ack
[19:50:14] andreastt: grep -rI --exclude-dir="\.svn" says the internet
[19:50:22] andreastt: `sudo aptitude install ack-grep`
[19:50:28] andreastt: `ack something`
[19:50:32] andreastt: As it ignores .svn by default.
[19:51:18] AutomatedTester: omg... ack where have you been all my life
[19:51:41] andreastt: .svn is soo annoying.
[19:51:44] RossPatterson: Subversion ditched the .svn-subdirs-everywhere model in 1.7, now there's just /.svn
[19:52:13] andreastt: RossPatterson: I'm using the latest Ubuntu, and that only has 1.6.17.
[19:52:47] RossPatterson: You REALLY want to upgrade.  The time to "svn update
[19:53:06] RossPatterson: ..." a big workspace has decreased immeasurably.
[19:53:20] andreastt: I really want to upgrade when it's considered stable by a distro. (-:
[19:53:49] andreastt: Debian is on 1.6.12, it seems.
[19:54:14] RossPatterson: Ah.  Well, it'll happen some day.
[19:54:16] freeone3000: andreastt: Debian stable tends to lag a few years behind. It's "stable" in the same sense that CentOS is, not in any reasonable person's definition.
[19:54:40] andreastt: freeone3000: That's usually fine by me. (-:
[19:54:43] RossPatterson: "Fudd's Law: If you push something hard enough, it will fall over."
[19:55:20] freeone3000: So. This bit me before: Where can I see versions of current browsers supported by a given version of selenium webdriver?
[19:55:42] andreastt: It varies from implementation to implementation.
[19:55:56] andreastt: I'd suggest looking at the documentation for that particular version.
[19:56:13] AutomatedTester: o.m.g. why google are you pushing eclipse
[19:56:28] detronizator: AutomatedTester: so, u went to velocity not to google io?
[19:56:35] AutomatedTester: detronizator: yea
[19:56:42] andreastt: It _would_ be useful with a matrix of supported browsers, though.
[19:56:54] andreastt: lukeis was working on one a long time ago, I think.
[19:56:57] detronizator: AutomatedTester: I'm sure velocity was good, but all the freebie are "succulenti"
[19:57:10] AutomatedTester: detronizator: maybe next year
[19:57:30] AutomatedTester: problem is I/O doesnt fit in with my role so its a harder sell :)
[19:57:39] detronizator: AutomatedTester: next year I'll pay myself for the flight - all that stuff makes up for the price
[19:57:47] detronizator: me too
[19:58:03] lukeis: andreastt: i'll need to get back on that... the current page http://seleniumhq.org/about/platforms.html#browsers  is utter crap in my opinion
[19:58:03] detronizator: personally I don't really deal with google services - not for work at least
[19:58:40] detronizator: even though I'll have to look if the new Google VMs thing can be used to automate PhantomJS build, for free
[19:58:45] freeone3000: Yeah. It also seems out of date - I know that 2.23.1 added support for firefox 12.
[19:59:00] andreastt: lukeis: I was just imagining a matrix in my head, then when looking at your link I realized how many different components there actually were. d-:
[19:59:08] detronizator: AutomatedTester: usually google does have free quota for their stuff
[19:59:13] freeone3000: The issue is that someone on my team has filed a bug report with firefox 13, and I need to write a regression test with it... and I can't prove it without having selenium running firefox 13, too.
[19:59:15] detronizator: and it's not 1yy max like Amazon EC2
[19:59:34] lukeis: andreastt: we'll end up needing multiple matrixes :)

[20:02:26] AutomatedTester: Chuckleteeth: yea
[20:02:40] Zack1: I've recently switched over from Selenium IDE to Webdriver using java and I was wondering if anyone knew valid techniques for searching for xpath //a elements in a div?  I used XpathCount in IDE previously.
[20:03:16] AutomatedTester: Zack1: do findElements(By.xpath('//a')).size()
[20:03:22] AutomatedTester: or getSize()
[20:03:28] AutomatedTester: I dont remember
[20:03:41] Zack1: AutomatedTester: thanks I'll try it out
[20:04:31] Chuckleteeth: is _ at the end of a method the standard way in the code to refer to a method as private?
[20:04:39] Chuckleteeth: in javascript
[20:05:00] AutomatedTester: I tend to put it at the beginning
[20:05:12] Chuckleteeth: like if i have to modify prepareToInteractWith_
[20:05:21] Chuckleteeth: whats an easy way to find everyting that calls it
[20:05:30] Chuckleteeth: besides a regex string search through the entire solution
[20:06:21] freeone3000: Chuckleteeth: Welcome to dynamic languages.
[20:06:50] Chuckleteeth: dread.
[20:07:23] danielwh: Chuckleteeth: In our javascript, trailing _, and a @private annotation in jsdoc means private
[20:07:40] Chuckleteeth: ok excellent
[20:07:41] danielwh: And grep.  Very much grep.
[20:07:51] Chuckleteeth: grep?
[20:08:00] danielwh: To find callers of a javascript function

[20:27:55] AutomatedTester: Chuckleteeth: to a specific version of Firefox?
[20:27:56] evilempire1: Does anyone have experience with Selenium  with PHP not sure whether i should use it the phpunit selenium extension
[20:28:07] evilempire1: or with another extension ("the facebook , adam goucher")
[20:28:57] Chuckleteeth: well no, im just looking through the code,if im going to make an option to center elements, should i trickle the option down much like the current WebDriverServer.enableNativeEvents 
[20:29:17] Chuckleteeth: thats probably gonna require alot more diff in alot more files
[20:29:58] evilempire1: whiel being at it do you use a file version management tool (not the right word)
[20:30:28] evilempire1: ( collaborative revision control seems to be one word)
[20:30:46] freeone3000: evilempire1: PHPUnit's selenium extension doesn't allow you to use their database extension simultaniously. This may matter.
[20:31:19] freeone3000: evilempire1: Selenium's only binding (that Selenium knows of) to PHP is through JSON. Get a third-party PHP binding to save yourself a ton of mucking about with curl. The facebook one's okay.

[22:01:27] Dude-X_: i've only seen people use FirefoxWebElement to override the commands
[22:01:41] jimevans: historically, there were differences. now that the wire protocol has been unified, there isn't any difference.
[22:01:53] Chuckleteeth: this javascript annotation stuff
[22:02:00] Chuckleteeth: how does it work
[22:02:08] Dude-X_: my project used to override click in FirefoxWebElement so that it can do a isDisplayed check
[22:02:09] Chuckleteeth: in the curly brackets is the type
[22:02:15] Chuckleteeth: what does the ! mean or type= mean
[22:02:28] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: it's used by the closure compiler.
[22:02:35] barancev: FirefoxWebElement overrides only constructor atm
[22:02:35] jimevans: i believe
[22:02:49] Chuckleteeth: so if i had an optional bool param, do i use {boolean=}?
[22:03:03] jimevans: i honestly don't know. i don't know what the markup syntax is.
[22:03:43] Chuckleteeth: now i understand why you didn't want to do this jim lol

[22:05:56] Chuckleteeth: ok thanks
[22:14:07] barancev: another question: why only InternetExplorerDriver(Capabilities capabilities) constructor prepares WindowsProxyManager for the driver? other constructors don't do that?
[22:15:01] barancev: what's right -- to prepare WindowsProxyManager or to not prepare?
[22:15:20] jimevans: barancev: i know next to nothing about the internals of the java bindings. the proxy stuff for IE is an open question.
[22:15:57] jimevans: though it probably should be handled by the native code, since no other bindings attempt to set the proxy for the IE driver.
[22:16:20] barancev: ah, I remember this comment by dawagner in an issue
[22:17:15] barancev: and nirvdrum added a comment that it can be implemented without registry modification
