Profile Dir: /tmp/tmpWccnWL Firefox output: \n(firefox:7361): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "thinice",\n*** LOG addons.xpi: startup\n*** LOG addons.xpi: checkForChanges\n*** LOG addons.xpi: No changes found\n'
[17:28:02] kallisti: I get this error when I attempt to evaluate Firefox() in python REPL.
[17:29:07] kallisti: Firefox actually starts, and then there's a long pause (meanwhile the python console isn't returning), and then finally an exception is thrown.
[17:29:26] kallisti: the theme "thinice" is one that I recently changed to using gtk theme manager.
[17:30:53] kallisti: loading up a default profile with the same theme produces the same warning, but the browser is useable afterwards.
[17:31:25] kallisti: (not in selenium I mean. if I just do firefox --no-remote -P then load a new profile it works fine)

[19:05:52] Dude-X_: eh?
[19:06:09] kallisti: which version of selenium
[19:06:21] Dude-X_: officially no version of selenium supports python3
[19:06:31] Dude-X_: the one that does is on my github
[19:06:39] kallisti: oh you actually meant 2.24
[19:06:47] kallisti: I'm using 2.7
[19:06:54] Dude-X_: okay
[19:07:05] kallisti: oh... you meant selenium version
[19:07:08] kallisti: I'm using 2.21 :P
[19:07:16] Dude-X_: 2.23 and 2.24 supports Firefox 13
[19:07:18] kallisti: I thought you were talking about python versions

[21:18:17] Bauer1: Is Selenium the proper tool for automating usage of interactive, web based applications? which have login, sessions, javascript etc
[21:18:37] Bauer1: I was not able to answer this question from what I've read so far
[21:19:27] Bauer1: I dont want to TEST stuff like with assertEquals or something, but just interactively operate a website from php, as if I were the user
[21:20:34] Dude-X_: yes you can automate a browser with selenium
[21:20:42] Dude-X_: however, you will want to do asserts in certain areas
[21:21:20] Bauer1: Dude-X: can you point me to a specific article or something showing me some of that? rather than using Selenium within Unit Tests
[21:22:06] Dude-X_: the seleniumhq website is sufficient; i don't know of a website that's like a tutorial
[21:22:38] Dude-X_: but basically you after you instantiate a driver instance, it will open the browser
[21:23:51] Dude-X_: then you will start with a driver.get(URL) to open the site, then you use driver.findElement(locator) to find an element and then with that element you can click, so it would look like driver.findElement(locator).click(), or driver.findElement(locator).sendkeys("message") to type stuff
[21:24:01] Dude-X_: that's basically the core of the api
[21:24:41] Dude-X_: there are other commands for dealing with frames, injecting javascript, handling javascript alert dialog boxes
[21:25:03] Bauer1: Dude-X: hmm, and what should I use? Selenium 1 (RC) or 2? or the IDE?
[21:25:22] Dude-X_: if you know how to program, then Selenium 2 also known as Webdriver
[21:25:36] Dude-X_: IDE is okay, but it's not that sophisticated
[21:27:31] Dude-X_: Selenium 1 is only in maintenance mode and will not get new features
[21:34:00] Bauer1: Dude-X: from what I am reading, Selenium requires a dedicated machine - doesnt that mean it can only run one series of commands at a time?
