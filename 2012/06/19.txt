[00:38:43] MicronXD: Anybody know of a Selenium library for Node.js that can control chromedriver directly?
[00:41:46] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[00:47:57] jarib: MicronXD: have you found any that can't?
[00:49:30] jarib: i think jleyba plans to release the official js bindings as an npm package eventually
[00:51:04] MicronXD: most seem to be made for a stand-alone selenium-server instance.
[00:51:19] MicronXD: I just want to control chromedriver directly
[00:51:29] MicronXD: if that's possible...
[00:51:49] MicronXD: idk. I'm hitting speed-bumps with selenium-server.
[00:52:35] jarib: what happens when you try against the chromedriver server directly?
[00:53:07] jarib: should work fine for most things
[00:53:12] MicronXD: I'm not given the option to.
[00:53:33] MicronXD: they all just connect to selenium-server on 4444 automatically
[00:53:41] jarib: the bindings don't let you specify a URL for the remote server? wow
[00:53:56] MicronXD: Can't I create a chromedriver instance without selenium, or no?
[00:53:58] jarib: you could start the chromedriver server on 4444
[00:54:29] jarib: not sure what you mean by "without selenium"
[00:54:38] MicronXD: selenium-server
[00:54:41] MicronXD: the jar
[00:54:44] jarib: yes, you can
[00:55:51] MicronXD: ok cool. that's one part of my blurred understanding of the whole selenium and webdriver thing that's been clarified :P
[00:56:35] MicronXD: ok. so I can run chromedriver on it's own? will chromedriver spawn instances of chrome?
[00:56:46] jarib: yes
[00:57:02] MicronXD: is that a yes to both?
[00:57:07] MicronXD: lol oh sweet
[00:57:13] jarib: for chrome, the java server is more or less a dumb http proxy, just piping commands through
[00:57:48] MicronXD: you have no idea how quickly you're clearing things up for me.
[00:57:51] MicronXD: ok...
[00:57:54] MicronXD: so
[00:58:36] MicronXD: selenium-server.jar is a proxy server that passes commands to webdrivers. webdrivers control browser instances.
[00:58:41] MicronXD: is that accurate?
[00:59:56] jarib: not 100%. only chrome and IE have a standalone executable server
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jun 19 01:00:15 2012]
[01:00:15] MicronXD: oh ok.
[01:00:37] MicronXD: so the standard webdriver has some built-in headless browser or something?
[01:00:47] brokenthumbs_ has joined #selenium
[01:01:54] jarib: the server includes the HtmlUnit driver, which is a headless browser written in java
[01:02:16] jarib: there's nothing "standard" about it though.. most people use webdriver with a real browser.
[01:04:14] MicronXD: ok... now I'm confused again. I was imagining 3 parts: selenium-server, webdriver/chromedriver, IE/Chrome/FF
[01:04:25] MicronXD: The server, the driver, and the browser. is that right?
[01:05:02] MicronXD: HtmlUnit is a headless browser that's packaged with webdriver?
[01:05:37] MicronXD: is chromedriver like webdriver, but without HtmlUnit packaged with it?
[01:06:01] santiycr has joined #selenium
[01:06:02] MicronXD: I'm sorry for all these questions. You're the first person to respond to me in this channel!
[01:10:22] jarib: webdriver is really just the name for the API
[01:11:16] jarib: it uses a client/server model (usually JSON over HTTP) to do IPC with the browsers
[01:13:16] jarib: if you're interested in the architecture, i gave a talk on this recently: http://vimeo.com/43380481
[01:13:27] MicronXD: heck yeah!
[01:13:29] MicronXD: thank you lol
[01:13:40] jarib: :)
[01:14:02] jarib: bedtime for me though. have fun :)
[01:14:54] MicronXD: holy crap!
[01:15:09] MicronXD: the first two minutes took care of half of what I wasn't understanding lol
[01:15:18] MicronXD: thank you so much! :P

[09:11:28] Gwaihir_: I have a WebDriver question about "element not present"
[09:12:00] Gwaihir_: JavaDoc for findElement advises to use findElements in this situation and check that a 0 length list is returned
[09:12:45] Gwaihir_: However, when no elements are found, findElements also waits for the implicit wait timeout - as its javadoc states
[09:12:53] Gwaihir_: so.. what's the point of using findElements here?

[09:45:20] dawagner: Thanks for the link, very cool!
[09:45:28] Gwaihir_: AutomatedTester: thanks! Do you also know why it waits for a first element? Wouldn't it be more practical if it just didn't adhere to implicit wait at all?
[09:45:59] AutomatedTester: Gwaihir_: you would think that but actually the opposite is true
[09:46:23] AutomatedTester: if you want to wait for more than 1 element it is always better to employ explicit waits
[09:58:46] Gwaihir_: well yeah, so.. we agree that it is inconsistent?
[09:59:22] Gwaihir_: I actually don't want to wait. I just don't like having to mess with the implicit wait to achieve that

[10:00:02] SamuraiJack has joined #selenium
[10:00:53] alexglow has joined #selenium
[10:01:46] Gwaihir_: in particular because I can't seem to get the current implicit wait from the driver. So I might afterwards "reset" it to an unexpected value
[10:01:55] AutomatedTester: Gwaihir_: I would recommend never using implicit waits
[10:03:02] Gwaihir_: really? I can't help but like them; we have a lot of ajax going on and it isn't intuitive to testers (who are way slower than the machine) where waiting for what is needed
[10:04:01] Gwaihir_: I consider the implicit wait to mimic that part of their human behaviour; it's what a human tester would do if something isn't there.. wait a little first.

[10:28:04] dawagner: barancev: Please do :) It's on my to do list, but towards the bottom
[10:28:27] barancev: is it correct to implement this as a capability?
[10:28:32] dawagner: capability unexpectedalert.behaviour = {dismiss,accept,ignore} is what I'm thinking

[10:28:47] barancev: it will be set at the start and cannot be cahnged later

[10:31:02] AutomatedTester: dawagner: I can wrap that error and go "Why are you being silly, IE doesnt work on WIndows" if you want

[12:35:05] barancev: according to the docs, selenium should supports 3.6, 10esr, latest (13?) and previous (12?)

[12:42:13] zac_sel: just curious, what happns if you try and get the text in a password field? do you get the password or just **** :)
[12:44:03] foolx: can anyone link me a good tutorial for css?
[12:44:32] Dude-X_: zac_sel, never tried it. but that's a good question
[12:44:49] Dude-X_: fools to learn CSS or CSS selectors?
[12:46:01] foolx: css selectors ! ;)
[12:46:21] Dude-X_: google css selectors, one of the top hits is 30 css selectors you should know
[12:46:25] foolx: i don't get mine to work and i don't want to simple get the right answer anymore
[12:46:41] foolx: i found that one, but that isn't helping in any way
[12:46:58] zac_sel: do you have firepath?
[12:46:58] Dude-X_: do you use tools like fire path on firebug on firefox?
[12:47:02] foolx: they are using selectors in kind of ul li:first-child {  
[12:47:02] foolx:    border-top: none;  
[12:47:02] foolx: }  
[12:47:18] foolx: yes, firepath on firebug on firefox ;)
[12:47:26] Dude-X_: those :selector is css3 selector
[12:47:27] zac_sel: cool :)
[12:47:31] Dude-X_: don't use css3 selectors
[12:47:57] foolx: i can get cssSelectors out of FFF, but those are just for exactly that element when everything is exactly like there ... and that isn't helping. 
[12:49:04] foolx: thats why i am searcing for a css Selector tutorial, because i simply can't use any of those css selectors (30) of that list. I can't even try to, because my code simply isn't working and Fp on fb on ff is not accepting any css selectors out of that tutorial
[12:49:59] foolx: i understand what they want to do with those {}, but that isn't usable in selenium (as far as i could see or firepath)
[12:51:04] Dude-X_: {} is for actual CSS to dress up HTML elements
[12:51:13] Dude-X_: you can use everything up to the {
[12:51:30] Dude-X_: and avoid using :command 
[12:52:47] foolx: how can i use? it is simply not working
[12:53:16] Dude-X_: sometimes a css selector will grab everything; in that case i use findElements and an index to get the element that i want
[12:53:27] Dude-X_: i have a few minutes before i have to get ready for work
[12:53:36] Dude-X_: can you paste a gist of the html and the thing you want to grab
[12:53:44] foolx: sec
[12:54:52] foolx: https://gist.github.com/2953733
[12:55:49] foolx: in the first step i want to select the div .info where span class="Servername" text = delivered value ('Europa 1') for example
[12:56:18] foolx: in a second step i want to use xpath to go up one element and select the button inside the new element.
[12:56:53] foolx: Basically: I got a value before selecting ('Deutschland 1' or 'Europa 1' or 'Lateinamerika 1') and want to select the right play button for the given value
[12:57:33] Dude-X_: so it's Europa 1, play? button,
[12:59:00] foolx: yes
[12:59:26] Dude-X_: it would  have been nice if your html included a title attribute
[12:59:34] Dude-X_: so it would be class='region' title='Europe'
[12:59:44] foolx: i can easily find all .info elements with findElements, but i miss the trick to tell him to just take that one .info where text = 'Europa 1'
[12:59:48] Dude-X_: is this something your devs have control with?
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jun 19 13:00:19 2012]
[13:00:19] foolx: thats one of my 99 problem... i can't get anyone to accept to change their html code to make my job easier ;)
[13:00:39] adamgoucher: css cannot inspect the text of an element. thats one of the reasons to fall back to xpath
[13:01:02] foolx: css can't? wow, didn't know that
[13:01:27] foolx: i can tell our devs to change that, but it won't likly happen
[13:01:28] Dude-X_: you can do a for loop, for x in findElements(.info): if x.getText().equals('Europe'): findElement(...)
[13:02:09] foolx: that was my idea also, but i didn't liked the idea ;) Thought there should be a way to make sure the right element is catched
[13:02:23] adamgoucher: or //[contains(@class, "info") and text()="Europe"]
[13:02:37] Dude-X_: that's what you have to use then^
[13:03:11] Dude-X_: in my experience, using text() is a bit flaky though
[13:03:22] Dude-X_: but if you're on firefox, it's okay
[13:03:44] foolx: adamgoucher: firePath didn't even like that ;(
[13:03:54] Dude-X_: that would work in selenium though

[13:05:32] amitev: adamgoucher: you asked because there is a fix in 2.23 for that
[13:05:57] adamgoucher: perhaps fix is too strong, but support might be appropriate
[13:06:26] Dude-X_: /div[contains(@class, "info") and text()="Europe"]  ; i find it a lithe better to use specific tag names; also you can make it generic and do string substitution text()='%s' so that you can use String.format(my_xpath, 'Europe')
[13:06:41] Dude-X_: all right time to get ready

[13:46:45] foolx: right about now i try to create a login test for every instance that is found. I am able to locate the right element ... but somehow i can't get the right button next to that element ;(
[13:47:00] Parabola: hmm
[13:47:06] Parabola: is there not an id or name on that button?

[13:48:33] Parabola: oh my
[13:48:42] foolx: nothing there is fixed. Not even the order of the servers. So in Step 1 i get to that page and get all instances as String.
[13:49:02] foolx: Step 2 is to call that page again for every string and select .servername with findElements.
[13:49:40] foolx: then i created a for loop into the .servername elements. When element.getText() equals my Instance-String, i am sure to have the right DIV...

[14:07:13] RossPatterson: (W3 Schools stuff on XPath is too simplistic to use as a reference.)
[14:07:27] foolx: thanks Ross, seems to work directly ;)
[14:09:53] foolx: when i want to go up 2 elements, i have to do "./../../div[starts-with(@class, 'server')].... or how can i go up more than one element?

[14:11:49] foolx: RossPatterson: thats what i was thinking too ... but it doesn't catch somehow
[14:12:34] barancev: I suppose selenium should not support FF10, but I wonder why the tests on CI are green
[14:12:57] RossPatterson: foolx: You can use Firefox extensions like FirePath and XPather to experiment with this stuff.  But "../" absolutely does mean "go up to the parent node".
[14:14:02] llaskin: i love firepath

[15:31:51] Parabola: jimevans: hey, i'm getting a mysterious "session JFKSDJFKLJSDFKLJSDK does not exist" with IE and i cannot for the life of me figure it out
[15:31:56] Parabola: jimevans: so, lets dance bud :P
[15:31:57] simonstewart: My money's on jimevans
[15:32:02] Dude-X: jimevans: it seems that the standalone server for IE is only necessary for local webdriver?
[15:32:16] Dude-X: i was testing grid and it didn't need the IE server
[15:32:30] jimevans: Parabola: you're using grid?
[15:32:43] eranm: bsilverberg, how soon can you fix it?
[15:33:06] jimevans: Dude-X: the java bindings, for now, look for the standalone server, and if it doesn't find it, falls back to the .dll. this behavior will change eventually.
[15:33:26] Parabola: jimevans: I am
[15:33:51] jimevans: thus, if you have a grid node for IE that doesn't have the standalone server, it won't *fail*, but you're also living on borrowed time.
[15:33:51] bsilverberg: I will look at it immediately. I will let you know within 15 minutes if I think I can fix it quickly. Does that work?
[15:33:52] simonstewart: In 2.25
[15:34:06] eranm: bsilverberg, yes
[15:34:07] eranm: thanks
[15:34:08] simonstewart: I've got jimevans' back on this :)
[15:34:16] Dude-X: jimevans: another issue is that IE server binds to 5555, so does the node by default
[15:34:22] Parabola: jimevans: it seems to always be IE8
[15:34:44] Dude-X: i think something needs to be adjusted so that using node and IE server "just works"

[16:41:59] Chuckleteeth: the navbar doesn't have to be bootstrap, its basically a div with fixed position at the top, my link is inside a tab and i think its getting confused where it is. The default behaviour seems to scroll such that the element is in the top left corner before attempting to click
[16:42:27] bsilverberg: dawagner: In fact it seems to have broken all the tests in most of my local browsers too
[16:42:37] dawagner: bsilverberg: Did I make a typo somewhere? :)
[16:42:37] Chuckleteeth: Anyone here have any more information on the logic for what it uses to determine if scrolling is required? Like which points does it test on the div?
[16:42:48] bsilverberg: I don't think so
[16:43:07] bsilverberg: When I say all the tests I mean all the tests in text_box_test
[16:43:21] Archdude: how do I obtain the current value of a dropdown in WD
[16:43:37] Archdude: if i grab the element it just stores as all dropdown values
[16:43:45] bsilverberg: I tried the same thing, just replacing PreviousElementSibling with PreviousSibling and ended up with a bigger problem, which I was just trying to debug when I saw your commit
[16:43:54] Dude-X: when it detects an element, it checks the size of the element, and compares the coordinates to the view screen, then it attempts to scroll
[16:44:13] Dude-X: it will click fine if the midway point of the element is visible in the viewport
[16:44:26] dawagner: bsilverberg: Investigating
[16:44:37] Chuckleteeth: what does it use to check if its visible in the viewport? i mean the element is visible and this only happens on IE
[16:44:41] bsilverberg: I was hoping that _I_ made a mistake, but after updating from svn I'm getting lots of failures in that test 
[16:44:50] Chuckleteeth: its definately visible but it attempts to scroll anyways
[16:45:35] Dude-X: can't speak about the IEdriver
[16:45:42] Dude-X: but it shoudl have similar commands to the firefox driver
[16:46:03] Chuckleteeth: i really thought this stuff was fixed before : (
[16:46:20] Chuckleteeth: i seem to remember a patch about fixing the needless scrolling
[16:46:25] Chuckleteeth: but my problem is like 2 bugs rolled into one
[16:47:24] barancev: Chuckleteeth: what browser and selenium version do you use?
[16:47:55] chrisculver701 has joined #selenium
[16:47:58] Chuckleteeth: IE 9
[16:47:58] barancev: current versions of selenium attempt to not scroll excessively
[16:48:11] Chuckleteeth: 2.22 is the selenium version
[16:48:33] jimevans: there's a discrepancy between how IE and firefox scroll the elements into view. they both use element.scrollIntoView(), but they use different arguments to the function.
[16:49:24] chrisculver701: how do you guys like to handle the drivers on your projects and test machines?(ex Chrome/IE/Opera drivers)  I am fighting with adding them to my nuget package due to the size of the files.  Or just manually adding them to the path of any test machine.
[16:49:25] barancev: atthe same time, there is #3034 that's not fixed yet

[16:50:22] Chuckleteeth: well its not a problem in firefox for me
[16:51:03] Chuckleteeth: like i said, i think its 2 bugs, first its getting confused that it needs to scroll at all... that could be due to the layout of the page in general
[16:51:25] Chuckleteeth: the second bug would be that after it thought it needed to scroll into view and it does that, it completely ignores the fact there is a fixed div at the top that would occlude it
[16:52:15] bsilverberg: eranm: I am done for now. I believe dawagner is seeing if he can get that IE issue fixed or whether it needs to be backed out
[16:52:39] eranm: bsilverberg, ack. 
[16:52:48] eranm: dawagner, you have until I finish the changelog

[16:53:14] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: as for whether it needs to scroll at all, i can't say; that's going to be very page-specific. the scrolling to the top is directly related to how scrollIntoView() is being called (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.scrollIntoView)
[16:53:44] dawagner: :yt weezer kids poker face
[16:53:44] eranm: jimevans, is there an issue related to r17162?

[16:54:21] jimevans: eranm: not that I'm aware of. why?
[16:55:21] Chuckleteeth: ok so if i attempt to call that javascript function directly in ie and it still scrolls such that its occluded, that would be classified as a bug with internet explorer then?
[16:55:51] Chuckleteeth: brb lunch
[16:56:33] bmulholland has joined #selenium
[16:57:26] eranm: jimevans, for the changelog.
[16:57:29] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: no, i wouldn't say so. the point is that no matter whether you scroll to the top or the bottom of the view port, you'll always run the risk of an absolutely positioned element occluding the element you're interested in. in your case, you hit the problem because the IE driver scrolls to the top. if we changed that, other people who have absolute-positioned elements at the bottom would hit the problem, as they do in firefox today.
[16:57:42] jimevans: oh.
[16:57:56] jimevans: no, it was just a request from a user.
[16:58:48] nirvdrum: barancev: What's up?
[16:58:58] simonstewart: dawagner: two can play at that game

[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jun 19 17:00:01 2012]
[17:00:01] caddoo has joined #selenium
[17:00:33] nirvdrum: I maintained grid for over a year and never knew it existed.
[17:00:43] nirvdrum: I can't think of a good reason to ever shut down your hub.
[17:01:10] nirvdrum: The rake task used to just issue a kill to the pid.
[17:01:19] nirvdrum: *shut down your hub over http.
[17:01:57] eranm: jimevans, aye.
[17:03:23] barancev: nirvdrum: think about starting grid and tests from ant builder -- I do remote shell calls to start hub and nodes. how can I stop them all when all my tests are done?
[17:03:25] nirvdrum: But, if it used to exist and we're supporting backwards-compatibility, I don't see any reason to not add it.  It should probably just be a new servlet.
[17:04:09] nirvdrum: Kill the pid, just like any other daemon.
[17:04:11] barancev: how to get pids of hub and nodes?
[17:04:19] lukeis: bmulholland: i fixed that issue last night... and looks like a release is very likely today :) yay for rapid release cycles!
[17:04:43] nirvdrum: You must start the hub some place.  $! contains the PID in bash.
[17:05:18] bmulholland: lukeis: I saw that and was going to thank you today :). That was quick!
[17:05:32] lukeis: easy ones are always quick ;)
[17:05:48] bmulholland: very true :)
[17:05:49] nirvdrum: Can you shut down a Selenium Server remotely?  How would you start it back up?
[17:06:02] nirvdrum: It seems like a bad idea.  But I'm probably misunderstanding something.
[17:06:22] alexglow has joined #selenium
[17:06:27] lukeis: i know some guys who programmatically start up a whole grid when running a test suite
[17:06:28] barancev: nirvdrum: I start it from the ant using rexec task: http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/rexec.html
[17:06:44] bmulholland: ssh? :D
[17:07:13] barancev: lukeis: I'm one of this guys (I have a project where a customers wants it)
[17:07:18] nirvdrum: barancev: But my point is if you're using one tool for process management, it should handle the entire process lifecyle.  I have to believe there's a way in ant to kill the process.
[17:07:25] nirvdrum: Otherwise, it's just kinda silly.
[17:07:57] nirvdrum: lukeis: How do they start up the hub programmatically and not capture the PID?
[17:08:16] lukeis: they do capture it afaik
[17:08:40] nirvdrum: Gotcha.  That's what I would imagine.
[17:08:57] barancev: it's not "process management tool", it's just a remote call, rexec
[17:09:02] nirvdrum: I start my hub up remotely through capistrano, but it's just an SSH command with a wrapper script.  It's all standard POSIX stuff.
[17:09:42] barancev: I'll try to think up a command that allows to read PID of the started process
[17:09:51] nirvdrum: barancev: It just feels very much like the problem is being solved in the wrong place.  FWIW, we also don't ship the rake or ant scripts.
[17:10:11] nirvdrum: barancev: If we have to do it as a servlet, so be it, but I'd like to see if we can do it smarter.
[17:10:34] barancev: any better ideas?
[17:10:52] nirvdrum: Use something smarter than rexec?
[17:10:59] nirvdrum: I know that's not a ton of help.
[17:11:51] nirvdrum: But this seems more like a failing of rexec.
[17:12:19] nirvdrum: I use something like this: https://gist.github.com/0ab516cfde0ddfedddd9
[17:12:29] nirvdrum: And then I just use a tool to SSH in and run that command.
[17:13:00] nirvdrum: But, I only ever shut down when I need to upgrade.  I was unaware anyone shut their hub down when tests are done.  That seems like it'd cause more trouble than it's worth.
[17:14:48] Dome has joined #selenium
[17:16:13] barancev: nirvdrum: thanks! I was thinking how to get PID on the client side, but you are right, it's possible to save it to the file on the server side, it's a great idea!
[17:16:20] noahsussman has joined #selenium
[17:17:04] nirvdrum: barancev: But, I would like to have some of the ant tasks we had in grid 1.  I was thinking they would be the node tasks, not the hub ones.
[17:17:23] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[17:17:24] nirvdrum: Our grid 1 compat guarantee is with regards to node <=> hub communication.
[17:17:54] nirvdrum: Since the hub was going to have to be started differently anyway, we freed ourselves up a bit from that.
[17:18:10] eranm: plenty of bugfixes in this release
[17:18:30] eranm: I wonder how many new bugs it contains ;)
[17:18:35] barancev: nirvdrum: /lifecycle-manager?action=shutdown was available in any selenium server instance in se1.0
[17:18:36] nirvdrum: eranm: Cool.  I need to pull soon.
[17:18:45] nirvdrum: I was playing with the Safari Driver a bit yesterday.
[17:19:03] eranm: how'd you like it?
[17:19:08] nirvdrum: barancev: Weird.  So, we support that in Selenium Server now?
[17:19:10] barancev: it was a recommended way to kill the selenium server

[17:25:47] Dude-X: btw, how do i do screen capture with remotewebdriver/grid
[17:26:09] barancev: barancev: I'm wrong, we do have support for shutDownSeleniumServer command in SeleniumServer class
[17:26:23] nirvdrum: Dude-X: The same way you would with a local driver.
[17:26:29] barancev: that's good news for me :)
[17:27:11] Dude-X: hmm...
[17:27:32] Dude-X: my test suite works well with firefoxdriver taking a snapshot when a test fails, but not when remote webdriver does it
[17:27:33] barancev: now I should stop the hub remotely
[17:27:55] nirvdrum: barancev: So, Selenium Server responds to that URL but hub does not?
[17:28:09] nirvdrum: Dude-X: Do you see the command in the node's log?
[17:29:17] Dude-X: yes, but i can't remember the exact exception, something like method takescreenshot doesn't exist
[17:29:55] barancev: nirvdrum: yes, selenium server can be stopped via URL http://localhost:4444/selenium-server/driver/?cmd=shutDownSeleniumServer
[17:30:14] lukeis: Dude-X: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html#taking-a-screenshot
[17:30:23] nirvdrum: That is such a terrible idea.
[17:30:51] nirvdrum: Dude-X: Weird.  I've kinda built a business around it, so I can assure you you can do screenshots remotely.
[17:31:13] nirvdrum: Dude-X: gist the exception the next time you see it.
[17:31:20] lukeis: nirvdrum / Dude-X you have to augment the remote web driver because it doesn't implement takesscreenshot
[17:31:31] Dude-X: yeah that's what i was thinking
[17:31:32] lukeis: (see link ^)
[17:31:48] nirvdrum: lukeis, Dude-X: Ahh, my bad.  I guess Jari did the hard work for me.
[17:32:01] lukeis: python and ruby implement it...
[17:32:19] Dude-X: yeah :D
[17:32:25] lukeis: java was just handling htmlunit as a special case and screw with the inheritance :-/
[17:32:38] Dude-X: alright it looks like an easy fix

[17:56:57] Chuckleteeth: its under something else 
[17:57:00] simonstewart: The chrome driver will check to see if an element you're about to click is covered by another

[18:45:35] bmulholland: llaskin: Having some good examples of CSS locators for certain situations would be very beneficial as well… for instance, the locator I use to detect if the page is loaded. A lot of pages I just don't know what to use, so I use the page heading with text specified… requires xpath :(
[18:45:38] llaskin: but i also know they aren't here yet...

[21:36:56] jimevans: Chuckleteeth_: just for you, i've released 2.24.1 of the IE standalone server. you should be able to set the elementScrollBehavior capability to 1 and have the elements scroll with the same behavior you see in firefox.
[21:37:14] Chuckleteeth_: jim, you are 100% ultimate badass
[21:38:04] Dude-X: Chuckleteeth_: how is scrolling different in firefox?
[21:38:09] jimevans: hey, don't thank me yet. i've only tried it a very little bit locally. :)
[21:38:13] Dude-X: heh
[21:38:37] jimevans: Dude-X: both scroll elements into the viewport by calling the JavaScript scrollIntoView().
[21:38:43] lukeis has joined #selenium
[21:39:06] jimevans: IE calls it with an argument of true, firefox with an argument of false.
[21:39:31] Dude-X: then it would try to scroll if element is not in view?
[21:39:48] Chuckleteeth_: you have the standalone up there at 2.24.1 but the c# bindings say 2.23.0, is this correct?
[21:39:52] jimevans: yes. that's what the method does. please see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.scrollIntoView
[21:39:57] Chuckleteeth_: java is at 2.24.1
[21:40:08] jimevans: Chuckleteeth_: don't go to seleniumhq.org.
[21:40:09] Chuckleteeth_: i guess i should have stated im using c# eh?
[21:40:12] Chuckleteeth_: oh
[21:40:20] jimevans: go directly to http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list
[21:40:38] jimevans: (which is what seleniumhq.org links to, but i've not yet updated it).
[21:40:40] Chuckleteeth_: oh ok awesome
[21:40:41] Chuckleteeth_: :D
[21:41:44] jimevans: since you're using .NET, you can also take advantage of the InternetExplorerOptions class which now also has an ElementScrollBehavior property.
[21:42:18] jimevans: (sometimes it helps that the .NET and the IE driver maintainer are the same person)
[21:44:32] Dude-X: wink, wink
[21:46:29] Chuckleteeth_: what is the proper way to use internetexploreroptions
[21:46:37] Chuckleteeth_: is it just an enum you pass to setcapability?
[21:47:55] jimevans: Chuckleteeth_: it's a class. you create an instance of it, set the properties like you want, and pass it into the constructor of InternetExplorerDriver.
[21:48:12] Chuckleteeth_: oh i thought it was part of desiredcapabilities
[21:48:17] Chuckleteeth_: since im using remotewebdriver
[21:48:42] jimevans: then create an instance, set the properties like you want, and call the ToCapabilities() method on it.
[21:49:17] jimevans: easy-peasy

[22:05:06] Archdude: is there any good reason at all to use waitr-ruby over webdriver-python?
[22:05:48] Archdude: i use webdriver w/ python and told a friend who uses waitr at his job that using pure webdriver is better but he seems to disagree
[22:06:09] jimevans: what's his argument?
[22:06:19] jimevans: i happen to find the watir api rather elegant.
[22:06:31] Archdude: he seems to think its faster but according to my tests and posts ive read, webdriver is faster
[22:06:36] jibay_ has joined #selenium
[22:06:42] jimevans: depends on the browser.
[22:06:55] Archdude: would you say using pure webdriver is all around better?
[22:06:58] jimevans: right now, anecdotally, watir is probably faster for IE
[22:06:59] barancev: Archdude: watir-webdriver and 'pure webdriver' have different APIs, but they share same engine
[22:07:24] barancev: whereas 'pure watir' uses its own engine
[22:07:51] *jimevans keeps meaning to get that performance suite created, but just doesn't have the time.
[22:07:52] Chuckleteeth_: ok i downloaded the latest bindings but that option doesn't seem to be in the internetexploreroptions class
[22:08:00] Archdude: I haven't used waitr much but I feel like webdriver has gotten a lot better in recent times 
[22:08:00] Archdude: say pa
[22:08:02] Archdude: st year
[22:08:15] jimevans: Chuckleteeth_: oh, you're right. i didn't rerelease the bindings.
[22:08:18] jimevans: sorry.
[22:08:52] farlan has left #selenium
[22:08:53] jimevans: do you need the newer bindings, or can you make do with DesiredCapabilities?
[22:08:57] barancev: btw, where 1.0 was launched? it should be about 1 year, a first birthday
[22:09:10] barancev: the first birthday
[22:09:28] Chuckleteeth_: can i set it directly in desiredcapabilities?
[22:09:33] Chuckleteeth_: that would actually be more handy
[22:10:03] jimevans: Chuckleteeth_: no reason you can't. you want the capability name to be "elementScrollBehavior" and the value to be 1.
[22:10:09] barancev: I mean 2.0 (it's night, time to sleep already :) )
[22:10:34] Dude-X: i've was using 2.0a around dec 2010
[22:10:46] Dude-X: but i guess 2.0 final was around june last year
[22:10:48] Chuckleteeth_: ok trying it now
[22:10:59] barancev: 2.0rc1 was in June, 2.0.0 was in July
[22:11:38] jimevans: Archdude: my opinion, i like the watir api, but i believe webdriver has a huge advantage in browser support, desktop *and* mobile
[22:12:08] Archdude: I think he might even just be using waitr, not waitr-webdriver
[22:12:09] Archdude: whic
[22:12:35] jimevans: but, again, since webdriver uses the automation atoms so extensively (which are javascript), it's virtually guaranteed that IE will be slower using webdriver (or watir-webdriver) than when you're using watir-classic

[22:13:54] jimevans: Chuckleteeth_: you're using the IEDriverServer.exe? and it's starting correctly on the remote machine?
[22:14:11] Chuckleteeth_: oh. i thought i could use the 2.24.1 standalone listed
[22:14:20] Archdude: I don't have much experience with waitr, but I feel that webdriver is the latest and greatest
[22:14:32] Archdude: and all-around better
[22:14:37] jimevans: no, that's a limitation of the standalone server. it only works remotely via the java remote server.
[22:15:03] *santiycr is super happy to see simon's last commit
[22:15:07] Chuckleteeth_: well for testing, im running a hub on my machine
[22:15:16] Chuckleteeth_: and the selenium standalone server on my machine aswell
[22:15:17] Chuckleteeth_: 2.24.1
[22:15:23] Chuckleteeth_: just trying to mimic my grid

[22:15:51] Chuckleteeth_: er wait, how is it executed?
[22:15:57] Chuckleteeth_: the standalone server will attempt to run that binary?
[22:16:04] jimevans: yes. exactly so.
[22:16:19] Chuckleteeth_: why is it required?
[22:16:24] jimevans: it uses a .dll version as a fallback, if it can't find the .exe (though that's going away in 2.25)
[22:16:36] barancev: SimonStewart: Tagging the 2.0 release from r12817
[22:16:37] jimevans: because it's the only way we can iterate faster.

[22:16:58] Chuckleteeth_: what do you mean by dll version? 
[22:17:10] Chuckleteeth_: the only thing sitting on my nodes is the standalone server jar file
[22:17:15] jimevans: here's a prime example. i just released a brand-new IE-only feature for you, but i didn't need to re-release the java .jar.
[22:17:24] Chuckleteeth_: i assumed you were using some microsoft stuff to start up IE
[22:17:48] jimevans: no, look, the IE driver is written in C++ code, right?
[22:17:53] Chuckleteeth_: yes
[22:18:05] jimevans: C++ can be compiled to a .dll, or it can be compiled to a .exe.
[22:18:13] Chuckleteeth_: yes
[22:18:20] jimevans: in the webdriver project, for now, we actually compile both.
[22:19:04] Chuckleteeth_: well where was the dll before?
[22:19:08] jimevans: the java bindings (which you're using if you're using remote) used to embed the .dll inside the .jar, and extract it at run-time, and use JNA to execute the C++ code.
[22:19:15] jimevans: give me a second, i'm getting there.
[22:19:16] Chuckleteeth_: ohooh
[22:19:19] Chuckleteeth_: ok that makes sense
[22:19:31] Chuckleteeth_: im picking up what your putting down
[22:20:01] jimevans: within the last six months, we started releasing the c++ code of the IE driver as a stand-alone executable, and the language bindings have been supporting it over time.
[22:20:03] Chuckleteeth_: so now the default behaviour is to check in the path for that exe, (or the working directory?) and otherwise use the internal dll which is getting deprecated
[22:20:16] jimevans: exactly so.
[22:20:35] Chuckleteeth_: so im gonna try just putting it in the same folder where the jar is
[22:20:37] Chuckleteeth_: see if it picks that up
[22:21:22] jimevans: give that a shot. i don't recall if the java remote server starts the IE driver as a separate console window or not.
[22:21:46] jimevans: if so, it'll be blatantly obvious that it's happening. :)
[22:23:38] Chuckleteeth_: WOOT
[22:23:39] Chuckleteeth_: it works
[22:23:43] Chuckleteeth_: thanks alot
[22:23:53] jimevans: glad to be able to help.
[22:23:58] Chuckleteeth_: this is probably gonna fix a ton of intermittant errors in my tests
[22:25:03] jarib: dawagner: extract.rb is something you have locally? if you're running ruby 1.8, you may need to add `require "rubygems"` (or pass -rubygems on the command line)
[22:26:05] jarib: jimevans: did any language binding stop shipping the dll yet?
[22:26:20] jimevans: .NET hasn't shipped it for 2 releases now.
[22:26:35] jimevans: (2.23 and 2.24)
[22:26:43] barancev: java uses dll as the last resort if there is no exe in the path
[22:27:41] barancev: so server does
[22:31:00] jarib: java was released twice today?
[22:31:03] jarib: 2.24.1
[22:31:15] jarib: the changelog doesn't mention a 2.24.0
[22:32:49] Dude-X: that's an error
[22:33:14] jimevans: yeah, it's a screwup.
[22:33:37] jimevans: the IE driver, on the other hand, *was* released twice today :)

[23:13:53] lukeis: btw, hi jarib, how you doing? been busy lately?
[23:14:17] AutomatedTester: dear lord Java is a convoluted language
[23:14:46] *lukeis only uses about 1% of java... and i'm a java programmer
[23:15:07] *AutomatedTester is building a grid plugin for Mozilla
[23:15:08] Dude-X: yes, and i have to maintain this java test suite :'( :american eagle crying:
[23:15:26] AutomatedTester: to do a regex is a lot of code
[23:15:39] Dude-X: oh regex in java is the worst
[23:15:45] barancev: AutomatedTester: use groovy
[23:15:54] Dude-X: also json is a pain too
[23:16:51] lukeis: my only complaint with java's jsonobject stuff is daniel's recent complaint that JSONArray is not iterable
[23:16:57] jarib: lukeis: doing ok, have a pretty serious family illness to deal with, so that has kept me busy.
[23:17:07] lukeis: ah, sorry to hear that
[23:17:09] Maior: is there a JSON library for Java that doesn't suck in one way or another?
[23:17:23] AutomatedTester: an array isnt iterable?
[23:17:29] lukeis: hoping for the best jarib
[23:17:32] AutomatedTester: sorry, who was the idiot that decided that...
[23:17:41] lukeis: exactly...
[23:17:41] Maior: net.sf does stupid things re type conversion
[23:17:45] AutomatedTester: <- not in the best of moods
[23:17:52] Maior: org.json has ALL THE CHECKED EXCEPTIONS
[23:17:53] Maior: etc.

[23:18:27] jarib: lukeis: thanks
[23:18:45] jarib: dawagner: extract.rb is something you have locally? if you're running ruby 1.8, you may need to add `require "rubygems"` (or pass -rubygems on the command line)
[23:19:08] AutomatedTester: lukeis: I dont mind people having a go at me but have the common decency to email me about it first
[23:19:34] lukeis: AutomatedTester: huh?

[23:20:28] Maior: dawagner: nowadays I write python
[23:20:51] lukeis: AutomatedTester: yeah... i stand by my first comment today... "Don't be a dick" - @wilw
[23:21:22] *lukeis is humored by the one celeb i follow on twitter (wil)

[23:39:28] lukeis: we're approaching 30k downloads per month in maven central of selenium
[23:40:01] santiycr: dawagner: awesome!!
[23:40:13] santiycr: that's perfect
[23:40:33] santiycr: glad I asked
[23:41:00] *dawagner has been experimenting.  Not a huge fan of squid.
[23:41:12] dawagner: On the other hand, yay for tests, and yay for speedup!
[23:41:32] AutomatedTester: hey Java people whats wrong with my regex Pattern urlPattern = Pattern.compile("http://(\\w+)");
[23:41:35] dawagner: If you run squid somewhere, and proxy the jar downloads through that host, you should be grand :)
[23:41:45] dawagner: AutomatedTester: Try double-escaping your backslashes
[23:42:04] AutomatedTester: dawagner: havent I already dont that?
[23:42:26] dawagner: "\\" maps to the string containing one backslash
[23:42:33] *AutomatedTester wants http://(\w+)
[23:42:35] dawagner: So to escape within the string, you need "\\\\"
[23:42:42] AutomatedTester: wtf is wrong with Java
[23:42:43] santiycr: dawagner: get ready, I'll be experimenting with this tonight
[23:42:58] santiycr: hopefully tests will get hella fast in the next few days
[23:43:06] dawagner: Awesome :) Let me know if you need a hand with anything
[23:43:37] santiycr: will do

[23:46:34] dawagner: System.out.println(Pattern.compile("http://(\\w+)").matcher("http://1asd").matches()); // true

[23:49:18] dawagner: Maior: Bless fanf, he answered me on twitter
[23:49:23] AutomatedTester: Java Y U NO HAVE String.Empty
[23:49:49] Dude-X: isEmpty() i think
[23:50:17] dawagner: AutomatedTester: You want Java to be MORE verbose?
[23:50:22] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: in c# that is a const for "" and looks nicer
[23:50:48] AutomatedTester: dawagner: String.Empty is nicer that "" in my opinion
[23:50:59] AutomatedTester: but what do I know...
[23:51:17] Dude-X: oh i see a constant
[23:51:28] dawagner: :note simonstewart You appear to have broken the build, good sir: http://sci.illicitonion.com:8080/job/Maven%20build/1385/
[23:51:29] selbot2: ok!
[23:52:51] dawagner: AutomatedTester: Do you also prefer Integer.Zero to 0?
[23:53:08] dawagner: for (var i = Integer.Zero; i < list.Length; ++i) { ... }
[23:53:10] barancev: who's next to push The Simon? ;)
[23:53:10] AutomatedTester: dawagner: depends
[23:53:42] AutomatedTester: wtf... I put system.out.println and my code works
[23:54:13] dawagner: Personally, I prefer a meaningful constant to a literal; I prefer a literal to a general purpose constant
[23:54:51] AutomatedTester: dawagner: in that sense no, by when I do private String MyFavouriteWord = "" I would rather do private String MyFavouriteWord = String.Empty
[23:54:51] dawagner: null, on the other hand...
[23:55:05] dawagner: String.IsNullOrEmpty or whatever it's called makes me cry :(
[23:55:20] dawagner: Each to their own :)
