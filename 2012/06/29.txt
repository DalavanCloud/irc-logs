[00:36:38] Nogem has joined #selenium
[00:38:29] Nogem: can anybody point me toward decent documentation on interacting with a file browser launched by a page? Crappy documentation is also acceptable at this point.
[00:39:24] Dude-X_: don't launch the file browser
[00:39:54] Dude-X_: firefox lets you type a path
[00:39:57] Dude-X_: IE maybe
[00:40:26] freeone3000: Nogem: You really can't. That's outside the control of the browser at that point.
[00:40:49] Nogem: I've been leaning toward using an API hook, but would really love to find some way to do it the same way a user would.
[00:42:55] Dude-X_: on windows people use AutoIT to control some things
[00:46:04] Nogem: I saw that, really don't want to sink my head into the land of AutoIT again. So brittle and doesn't distribute well.
[00:47:34] *Nogem sighs
[00:47:42] Nogem: API hook, here I go - thx everybody

[15:37:02] dawagner: fscking security-conscious people :P
[15:37:34] Parabola: AutomatedTester any insight into why firefox is grabbing the previous pages url with driver.getCurrentUrl ?

[15:37:49] Parabola: AutomatedTester: i've tested on ff 3 through 12 and it happens every time, ie and chrome work fine

[15:38:11] dawagner: Parabola: After doing what? Clicking?
[15:38:44] Parabola: dawagner: click a link (via link text) then grab current URL, and firefox gets the URL prior to the link click. I attempted a wait and had the same result
[15:38:59] dawagner: Got a test case? :)
[15:39:10] Parabola: I do, may I pm you?
[15:39:17] dawagner: Sure
[15:40:52] andreastt: dawagner: Will Google Compute Engine be available in Europe?
[15:41:13] Chuckleteeth: well im still lost, I dont see wrappedNative anywhere in code, i dont even know of a file that has 6386 lines
[15:42:00] Chuckleteeth: and i never touched anything in driver_component.js
[15:43:05] dawagner: andreastt: Yes.  It will be avaialble to Europeans when it launches publicly (you can sign up for a beta account now, too), and there will be European datacenters when it launches proper
[15:43:22] andreastt: I'm smelling an EC 2 killer?
[15:43:25] dawagner: I believe for the beta it's only got US DCs, in a few zones
[15:43:45] andreastt: (That's pretty awesome by the way.)
[15:43:55] dawagner: Somewhere on the site there is differentiated pricing for UK, EU and APAC data transfer
[15:44:12] andreastt: Cool.

[15:48:17] andreastt: Oo.
[15:48:37] benadderson: andreastt: If anybody knows the answer to my question, I'm guessing it's you :-) ^^
[15:48:49] jimevans has joined #selenium
[15:48:56] andreastt: benadderson: Which question is that?
[15:49:15] benadderson: [15:37] <benadderson> Does OperaDriver support native events? The Native Events documentation simply has a ? against Opera
[15:49:30] andreastt: You're in luck, I leave for vacation in ten minutes (-;
[15:49:49] andreastt: Opera has no concept of native events unless you're on OS X.
[15:50:01] andreastt: The short answer is no.
[15:50:04] jimevans: g'day all!
[15:50:10] Dude-X: o/
[15:50:13] Chuckleteeth: hi
[15:50:25] benadderson: andreastt: No worries, thanks for clearing that up :-)
[15:50:37] andreastt: benadderson: The longer answer is that we don't need native events since we have access to Opera's internals through the debug protocol.
[15:50:38] toabctl has joined #selenium
[15:50:50] andreastt: benadderson: So you shouldn't need native events when testing with Opera at all.
[15:51:04] Dude-X: that sounds attractive
[15:51:05] jimevans: does anyone know of a sample site that include visible/invisible and enabled/disabled elements? i'd strongly prefer one from a long-term source like mozilla or google, but i'm not that picky.
[15:51:24] andreastt: benadderson: The exception is OS X, for which Opera needs focus.
[15:51:34] andreastt: That's a known bug, which we at some point will fix.
[15:51:40] jimevans: the closest thing i've found is pages on *ptui* w3schools.com
[15:51:53] benadderson: andreastt: I was curious from the point of view of "native events are closer to how a user interacts with your app" (closer vs RC, that is)
[15:53:05] dawagner: jimevans: Why do you need a real site?
[15:53:34] dawagner: benadderson: What we aim to do is give the browser the exact stimulus as if a user had really done the thing
[15:53:47] xirkus has joined #selenium
[15:53:48] andreastt: benadderson: Okay.
[15:53:57] dawagner: If that means sending a message to the browser saying "OS says someone's just clicked here" that's correct *and* reliable
[15:54:23] dawagner: If that means sending an OS-level event, that's correct, but less reliable
[15:54:34] jimevans: dawagner: i'm working on a patch for another library, one that doesn't host its own test pages. (dangerous, i know, but that's the way the project does it)
[15:55:16] andreastt: benadderson: So for Opera we don't trigger the UI components for regular OperaDriver testing, but we send off events internally to the actions linked to the elements you click on.
[15:55:31] Chuckleteeth: AutomatedTester: ok i figured out what was causing the exception
[15:55:49] andreastt: So if you say element.click(), that will tell Opera to simulate a click on mouse position x,y in the viewport.
[15:55:50] Chuckleteeth: but im not sure the proper workaround nor do i fully understand what closure is doing to this object
[15:56:12] andreastt: Since Opera's core browser renderer is completely decoupled from the UI of the browser, we're able to do that rather reliably.
[15:56:40] andreastt: There are some added complexity for Mobile and other products, though.
[15:56:45] andreastt: s/are/is
[15:57:08] benadderson: andreastt: and bypass any instability in the code that interacts with the OS as well - nice :-)
[15:57:13] Parabola: lol opera
[15:57:15] andreastt: Precisely.
[15:57:21] benadderson: now that you say it, its pretty obvious
[15:57:29] benadderson: thanks for explaining!
[15:57:37] andreastt: My pleasure (-:
[15:57:57] benadderson: Enjoy your vacation!
[15:57:58] Dude-X: when is 12.0 coming out?
[15:58:05] benadderson: thanks also to dawagner
[15:58:09] Parabola: its out
[15:58:13] andreastt: There are a few downsides, though.  For instance you can't use Actions to click anywhere outside of the viewport.
[15:58:15] Dude-X: BAM!
[15:58:15] Dude-X: ok
[15:58:32] andreastt: But you can if you use the system-input Scope service, which we've hidden down deep inside OperaDriver.  That actually does native events.
[15:58:35] Parabola: I havent used opera since like 2003
[15:58:40] Parabola: I forgot it existed
[15:58:42] andreastt: Dude-X: It's already out.

[IRC logfile - Started Fri Jun 29 16:00:16 2012]
[16:00:16] Dude-X: i guess he uses all it's features
[16:00:19] Parabola: so opera on gnome-shell 3
[16:00:27] andreastt: If your website works in Opera, there's a very good chance it works in all the other browsers.
[16:00:39] Parabola: looks like hell, the menu bar button is all screwed up
[16:00:41] dawagner: As I was typing before my food got delivered: If that means faking out javascript events that we thinkg will be fired, that's (generally) reliable, but not necessarily correct
[16:00:56] Parabola: andreastt: can you tell me if this is normal
[16:00:59] andreastt: Since we're pretty much a marginalized browser, it means we really have to make sure that all sites work.
[16:01:26] andreastt: And besides, testing with WebDriver in Opera is pretty stable and fast.
[16:01:36] Dude-X: yeah it's almost as fast as firefox
[16:01:38] andreastt: Parabola: The menu bar?
[16:01:40] Parabola: http://imgur.com/kQDBN
[16:02:07] andreastt: Looks like it should.
[16:02:24] andreastt: However it's slightly buggy on my Linux too.
[16:03:03] Parabola: the button is cut off
[16:03:09] andreastt: Probably a bug.
[16:03:14] Parabola: :-\ not gonna lie, this is considerably slower than chromium
[16:04:16] andreastt: Parabola: I'm sure they're working on it (-;
[16:05:29] AutomatedTester: going to get coffee
[16:07:11] Dude-X: someone finally fixed a bug i filed in 2007 for python on windows
[16:10:37] Parabola:  andreastt the inspector tools on opera are pretty nice

[16:16:44] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: my biggest bug in Firefox is over 8 years old :/
[16:17:23] Dude-X: is it still relevant today
[16:18:10] AutomatedTester: yes
[16:18:22] ian_mac: how do you measure the size of a bug?  </pedantic>
[16:18:41] AutomatedTester: Firefox keyboard shortcuts dont work if there is a flash element on the page
[16:18:51] RossPatterson: ian_mac: I use a micrometer.
[16:18:52] Dude-X: by the number of library of congresses 
[16:20:21] AutomatedTester: ian_mac: you can only measure it when you have done the root cause
[16:21:09] AutomatedTester: and then its the cost of fixing it, plus the cost of users finding it and the impact it has on the brand plus the cost of rolling it out
[16:21:22] AutomatedTester: so its about the same length as a piece of string

[18:42:33] detronizator: jimevans: luckly some of the infrastructure choices I made (particularly, designing the error handling before even implementing commands) will pay off. So far I have seen that the mix of Atom and generalised error handling makes adding new commands piece of cake.
