[00:19:31] tessarakt2: ok, I fixed the JavaScript
[00:20:03] tessarakt2: and greatly simplified it ... it re-implemented a JSON encoder -> JSON.stringify() is much easier
[00:21:39] tessarakt2: but the value returned by executeScript is null :-<
[00:21:46] jarib: tessarakt2: you know webdriver essentially does JSON encoding/decoding for you? 
[00:22:02] jarib: .executeScript("return { foo: 'bar' };")

[00:22:30] tessarakt2: even better ...
[00:22:38] tessarakt2: "If the script has a return value (i.e. if the script contains a return statement), then the following steps will be taken:"
[00:22:51] tessarakt2: the guy who wrote the script forgot the "return" ...
[00:23:07] tessarakt2: I wonder if something has changed since 2010 regarding that ...
[00:23:37] Dude-X: all my javascript that i expect values have a "return"
[00:24:35] tessarakt2: he just put the expression of which he wanted the value at the end ...
[00:24:40] tessarakt2: well, now it works ...

[14:03:56] caddoo: Is this the right channel for discussions of test case design using selenium, or purely just using selenium
[14:04:16] llaskin1: caddoo: both can be discussed here
[14:04:31] llaskin1: we discuss QA as well as using selenium, and writing selenium code(the actual design of the product)
[14:04:32] llaskin1: :ask
[14:04:33] selbot2: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[14:05:14] caddoo: Well ok, I have a table. That get's data from a model via AJAX. The table functionality includes sorting and searching.
[14:05:37] caddoo: Do I write tests out for the sorting and ensuring all rows are correct and in the correct order
[14:05:48] caddoo: and the same applies to searching
[14:05:54] llaskin1: i mean, thats for you to decide
[14:05:59] llaskin1: if you are doing a full regression pass, I would argue yes
[14:06:02] llaskin1: if a smoke test, i would argue no
[14:06:05] caddoo: basically this will take a fair bit of time. How do I decide my limits on searching
[14:06:12] caddoo: *searching -> testing
[14:06:22] llaskin1: well automated testing in the long run, costs 0$
[14:06:59] llaskin1: so decide how long you are willing to devote to it(testing this piece of functionality) vs how often it breaks...which will become your value proposition for if its worth setting up testing for it..
[14:07:18] llaskin1: if it takes you 6 months to code, and it breaks NEVER, then why bother?  
[14:07:27] llaskin1: if it takes you 2 weeks to write, and it breaks every other day...its worth it
[14:07:33] llaskin1: somewhere in the middle is probably the ideal value
[14:07:33] caddoo: ok
[14:07:56] caddoo: does the word 'fixtures' mean anything to you guys
[14:08:01] caddoo: or is that just in the framework im using
[14:08:28] llaskin: never heard of it
[14:08:33] llaskin: what language are you writing in?
[14:08:37] llaskin has joined #selenium
[14:11:14] llaskin: caddoo:  i would think that way about every test you plan to automate
[14:11:20] llaskin: decide if its worth it, and prioritize it that way
[14:11:27] caddoo: ok
[14:11:48] caddoo: llaskin: it's in Yii (php). It's just temporary database table rows used for testing
[14:11:57] llaskin: php is not supported by Selenium2.
[14:12:06] llaskin: consider another language....(imo)
[14:12:07] Dude-X_: caddoo, fixtures are pre-existing data for your web app.
[14:12:29] llaskin: I am in the long run, working on automating over 50k test cases.  I have test suites that take 3+ hours to run, but I have single tests that run in seconds.  The longest thing that took time was writing my background methods to work with everything on the page(s)
[14:12:34] llaskin: Dude-Xwhat framework is that?
[14:14:25] caddoo: ah balls. Selenium plugin isn't available in netbeans 7.2
[14:14:33] caddoo: no wonder my new tests weren't running
[14:15:16] llaskin: i refuse to upgrade netbeans past 6.9.1
[14:15:21] llaskin: cuz they removed ruby support in 7.0

[14:22:15] Dude-X_: llaskin, it's not a framework, it's just terminology for test environment
[14:22:25] llaskin: oh ok
[14:22:26] Dude-X_: if you can't test with real data, then you need to have pre-existing data
[14:22:27] llaskin: never heard of it before
[14:22:31] llaskin: i learn something new today:)
[14:22:34] mdgreenfield has left #selenium
[14:22:39] llaskin: i just create my data on the fly as part of my testing
[14:22:40] llaskin: :)
[14:23:13] Dude-X_: that's good, but say you need 100 hundreds of items, you don't want to introduce flakiness or long wait times creating data
[14:23:23] Dude-X_: fixtures come into play
[14:23:38] Dude-X_: though if you ask different people about the idea of fixtures, some say it's bad
[14:24:00] llaskin: cool
[14:24:07] Dude-X_: i guess ultimately, it comes down to, don't be a moron when testing
[14:24:19] Dude-X_: or simply, be aware of how your'e testing
[14:29:29] caddoo: How can I test if selenium is infact working in Netbeans
[14:29:34] caddoo: is there anything quick I do
[14:30:50] ebass: sounds a lot like mocking data...
[14:31:37] llaskin: caddoo: you can run the basic test of "open google, find the search box, search for something"
[14:31:41] llaskin: fast to write, easy to code, etc
[14:31:49] caddoo: but how
[14:31:59] llaskin: well, we're not going to write the code for you...
[14:32:03] caddoo: I don't think I understand selenium enough... 
[14:32:05] ebass: leo will
[14:32:06] ebass: i wont.
[14:32:08] caddoo: I mean. I have test cases written
[14:32:10] ebass: :-P
[14:32:22] caddoo: But they aren't executing when I peform 'run all tests'
[14:32:30] caddoo: my PHP Unit tests are
[14:32:43] llaskin: unsure
[14:32:51] llaskin: eric: sorry too busy to write other peoples code:)
[14:32:57] ebass: have you checked out the seleniumhq website
[14:33:15] ebass: they have good simple examples there that will show you how to create simple selenium tests.
[14:33:35] Dude-X_: mocks are different from fixtures, typically fixtures is data in a database that your application will load when running in a test environment 
[14:33:56] ebass: ah ok
[14:34:12] ebass: ive used fixtures a lot then
[14:34:18] ebass: i just called it "test data"
[14:34:30] ebass: all this crazy terminology
[14:35:10] llaskin: you kids and your crazy terminology
[14:35:16] ebass: :-D
[14:35:22] llaskin: i used to be with it...then what was "it" changes...and now I'm not with it anymore....
[14:35:48] jimevans: :note santiycr i've not done any specific testing on it, but i don't know of reasons why it wouldn't work. dawagner's done some and met with some success.
[14:35:49] selbot2: ok!
[14:35:52] ebass: i gave up on buzz words a long time ago...
[14:36:19] ebass: so noone understands me.
[14:36:24] Dude-X_: but it's pre-existing data, there would be some script that runs to prep the database, so say if you run a web driver test, all the data you need to check functionality should just be there so you can avoid creating the data yourself

[14:36:44] robbim02 has joined #selenium
[14:37:10] Dude-X_: come to think of it the other week, i had a discussion with my coworkers differentiating the term 'fixtures' versus 'test data' :p
[14:37:18] ebass: the way i see it Dude-X_ is that you are just moving where you are manually creating data.
[14:38:17] Dude-X_: it's just to save time creating data; you don't want your tests taiing 2 hours when it can be done 1:15 minutes
[14:38:36] Dude-X_: of course you should have a test that creates data, and verify that the data exists
[14:39:02] ebass: i hear that...my bottleneck has always been with how long it takes Selenium to retrieve text from the page.
[14:39:10] ebass: well..how long it takes WebDriver
[14:39:13] llaskin: my bottleneck is load time on a few of the pages here actually
[14:39:25] llaskin: and its significantly longer loadtime in a WD instance then in a non WD instance
[14:39:36] Dude-X_: ebass do you mean it stalls on trying to retrieve text?
[14:39:38] llaskin: i'm hoping to have Simon take a look at it if SEConf is in boston next year
[14:39:50] ebass: i mean it takes forever whenever i call getText
[14:40:06] Dude-X_: on a single element or from a list of elements?
[14:40:10] ebass: yes
[14:40:20] Dude-X_: i've noticed that it's slow iterating through a list of elements
[14:40:25] Dude-X_: to get it's text
[14:40:36] ebass: i believe the problem is that WebDriver spends a lot of time checking visibility
[14:40:49] Dude-X_: yes it does staleness checks
[14:40:49] ebass: before attempting to get text
[14:40:55] Dude-X_: and then visibility checks
[14:41:23] ebass: whereas selenium just blindly runs the javascript method to get the text for the node
[14:41:47] ebass: i was able to speed up WebDriver by overriding the getText methods with my own...
[14:41:55] ebass: but its not really an ideal solution
[14:42:17] ebass: llaskin has heard my sob story time and time again
[14:42:35] Dude-X_: are you executing javascript that just extracts text?
[14:42:41] ebass: you bet
[14:42:51] Dude-X_: i am intrigued and would like to subscribe to your newsletter.
[14:42:56] ebass: hahaha

[14:46:25] ebass: wrong, he allowed it to happen.
[14:46:34] llaskin: hence "sap"
[14:46:37] ebass: he ruined himself
[14:46:56] llaskin: he's coming up in July, we should all get together

[14:52:02] jimevans: ebass: so about getting text. the webdriver getText() mechanism is computationally expensive. the API has a very specific definition of what "getting the visible text of an element" means. it's not as simple as just calling element.innerText. if that's your requirement, then you're doing the right thing by overriding the API implementation with one of your own.
[14:52:07] llaskin: thats the last reply you made to the user group....in December

[15:00:40] ebass: i really dont pay attention much to where i am saying stuff
[15:00:44] ebass: i just say  it
[15:00:48] ebass: thanks jimevans
[15:01:10] ebass: i thought that was the case, which is why I was doing it.
[15:02:02] llaskin: negative, nothin.  if you remember/find it, i'd appreciate seeing your idea/solution
[15:02:18] ebass: well, i noticed you have a loop that polls every 2 seconds
[15:02:30] ebass: i am not sure how your page works
[15:02:40] llaskin: i don't even remember the email i sent
[15:02:43] llaskin: so pls remind me what the email was
[15:02:44] llaskin: lol
[15:03:10] ebass: but i thought it could be possible for you to miss the condition you were looking for
[15:03:17] ebass: if your site has a bunch of ajax
[15:03:42] ebass: it had something to do with a test that takes like 2 hours when ur using webdriver
[15:03:48] ebass: like what you mentioned above.
[15:03:54] llaskin: ebass, yes.
[15:04:04] llaskin: i am polling for an item's existence
[15:04:08] llaskin: so it either exists, or doesn't....
[15:04:16] ebass: thats deep.
[15:04:34] llaskin: i know right?  i'm the next confucious
[15:04:44] ebass: right, i thought it would be possible for it to exist and then not before your 2 seconds was over.
[15:04:53] llaskin: negative:(
[15:04:54] jimevans: :ci status
[15:04:56] selbot2: 0 building | 26 successful | 4 unstable | 0 failing | 1 aborted
[15:04:59] llaskin: my site literally takes longer to load
[15:05:01] llaskin: if i watch it
[15:05:05] llaskin: its not a selenium issue
[15:05:09] llaskin: it actually just takes longer to load
[15:07:55] ebass: have you tried installing webdriver into a firefox browser along with firebug and manually loading the site
[15:08:09] skiphuffman: Good morning.  I am still having my problem where I can run the exact same test through the same grid and node from two different test nodes and get different results.  I have collected and analyzed log files, and found WHERE the failure occurs, but I really could use help with WHY it occurs and how to keep it from occuring.  My log file snippets are here: https://gist.github.com/2888977
[15:08:15] ebass: you can then use the firebug javascript profiler and the net tab to see where the time is being spent.
[15:08:53] skiphuffman: I have both a "Working" and a "Failing" snippet there.  If I didn't get the key parts, I can collect more.
[15:10:18] llaskin: ebass: i haven't

[15:10:50] Ammar01 has joined #selenium
[15:11:26] ebass: try that
[15:16:53] caddoo: When I'm sorting my columns via AJAX, I need to wait maybe 1 or 2 seconds before peforming the next check
[15:16:57] caddoo: What options do I have
[15:17:04] caddoo: If no new elements are created
[15:18:50] skiphuffman: caddoo, can you loop and look at the contents of the columns?  Stop looping when the contents have stopped changing?  Assuming that the sort is dymanic.
[15:18:52] ebass: does the sort add or remove a css class from the column element?
[15:19:00] ebass: probably the column header.
[15:19:00] skiphuffman: Otherwise Just keep checking until it refreshes.
[15:19:25] ebass: we had an icon that went from pointing up to down
[15:19:46] ebass: and when that was changed our ajax request was done.
[15:20:14] bburton has joined #selenium
[15:21:20] caddoo: skiphuffman: so ill look for some sort of table row iteration
[15:25:28] ebass: skiphuffman: i cannot see a difference between the passing and failing cases...
[15:25:33] skiphuffman: caddoo, pretty much.  There must be some way that a human user knows the that process is done
[15:25:39] dawagner: :note santiycr Yes, we fully support 32-bit IE10 on 32-bit Win8. 32-bit IE10 on 64-bit Win8 has some issues which are microsoft-owned.  64-bit hasn't been put out in the previews.
[15:25:41] selbot2: ok!
[15:25:46] dawagner: jimevans: ^^
[15:25:56] skiphuffman: caddoo, How does a human know whether it worked?
[15:26:07] caddoo: the values of the cells have changed
[15:26:11] caddoo: and pagination has changed
[15:26:22] caddoo: well no sorry not pagination, i mean column header class changes
[15:26:50] ebass: so wait for the column header to change
[15:26:50] llaskin has joined #selenium
[15:27:29] ebass: thats how i used to do it.
[15:27:39] ebass: so long as the header changes after the ajax request is completed.
[15:28:20] skiphuffman: Ok, so pro grammatically read the value of the top cell, then pause a moment, recheck, lather, rinse, repeat until either the top cell changes, or you are sure it won't by timing out.
[15:29:23] caddoo: waitForCondition skiphuffman?
[15:29:46] skiphuffman: You probably need to cook your own wait.
[15:30:47] ebass: you could probably use one of the canned ExpectedConditions
[15:30:51] ebass: like visibilityOfElementLocated
[15:31:11] ebass: and use a selector to find that element with the specific css class
[15:31:39] skiphuffman: but the first element is probably always visible, just the contents of that element changes.  Am I right, caddoo?
[15:31:56] caddoo: Yes
[15:32:43] ebass: im not sure that matters if the selector is looking for an element with a class that is not there...
[15:32:57] caddoo: A table is inserted into the page with JS (no content). And the contents are grabbed by AJAX. Let's say there is 10 per page. We grab 30 records a buffer. So the first 3 pages are loaded already. When you get to the 3rd page the next lot of data is fetched with AJAX
[15:33:00] skiphuffman: So if your list contained ['Cherries', 'Grapes', 'Apples']  and you pulled the first item of the list is "cherries" and you fire off a sort.
[15:33:01] ebass: technically the element is visible but there is no element on the page with that class
[15:33:38] skiphuffman: Then you fire off the sort function and pull the first element every half second until it contains "Apples"
[15:34:31] skiphuffman: until FirstElement.value() == "Apples"; time.sleep(.5);
[15:34:36] stockton has joined #selenium
[15:34:55] skiphuffman: (But that is an infinite loop, so you probably want a breakout in there as well).
[15:35:25] caddoo: ok
[15:36:01] skiphuffman: timeout=0; until (FirstElement.value() == "Apples") or (timeout > 10); time.sleep(.5); timeout += .5;
[15:36:05] skiphuffman: something like that.
[15:36:18] caddoo: that's JS right
[15:36:47] caddoo: right I have to read the selenium docs a bit more
[15:37:04] skiphuffman: actually that was pretty much all python(ish)
[15:37:55] skiphuffman: except for the FirstElement.value()  (which isn't pure selenium either.  I tend to bury the selenium library down a couple levels.)
[15:38:15] caddoo: Is the selinium IDE recommended
[15:38:48] skiphuffman: The selenium IDE is a fine starting point for learning the syntax of selenium code.
[15:38:57] caddoo: yeah i might use this first
[15:39:08] skiphuffman: Also very useful for identifying elements on a page.
[15:39:17] skiphuffman: I don't find it useful for creating production code.
[15:40:05] pnitin has joined #selenium
[15:40:22] skiphuffman: Also I think webdriver does a heck of a lot more than IDE supports.
[15:42:30] skiphuffman: On the other hand.  Does anyone have any insight into my problem?  Why does my test fail when started from one node, but pass from another.  https://gist.github.com/2888977

[15:54:42] caddoo: right ok
[15:54:53] caddoo: well currently im using PHPUnit to peform my tests
[15:54:56] llaskin: says the former IDE maintainer
[15:54:57] llaskin: :-P
[15:55:10] adamgoucher: there is a reason for the 'former' title
[15:55:18] chainey has joined #selenium
[15:55:27] caddoo: so when skiphuffmangave me advice the code he gave (python?) I have no idea what to do with it
[15:55:34] adamgoucher: i can live with some irony, but that amount was a little stifling
[15:55:35] skiphuffman: I still find it useful to figure things out.  The instant feedback is uesful.
[15:55:59] skiphuffman: Yeah, mine was pythony.  What language are you going to write your tests in?
[15:56:06] caddoo: PHP
[15:56:08] skiphuffman: A timer loop is a pretty common beast in any language.
[15:56:18] caddoo: I see
[15:56:19] skiphuffman: Erg.  Well, I am not a PHP guy at all.
[15:56:30] caddoo: so you are delaying the script using the programming language alone
[15:56:31] adamgoucher: firebug's console using $$() and $x() replicates the only reasons to use se-ide these days 
[15:56:36] skiphuffman: but you should be able to do a "while" loop
[15:56:45] jleyba has joined #selenium
[15:57:06] skiphuffman: Yeah, I let the programming language control most stuff except accessing and communicating with the browser
[15:57:28] skiphuffman: (browser/node/hub)  all that nonsense.
[15:58:08] skiphuffman: PageObjectModel is really a slick technique.  But I seem to recall that PHP is not particularly OOP.
[15:58:27] adamgoucher: php actually produces pretty slick page objects
[15:59:01] skiphuffman: So instead of my "FirstItem.value()"  you might need to do a CurrentValue= get FirstItem  kind of thing.
[15:59:11] skiphuffman: adamgoucher, Oh!  Ok then.
[15:59:20] adamgoucher: (at least how i write them)

[16:03:12] jleyba: lol, ok :)
[16:03:48] jimevans: the behavior in Script.cpp seems to just match integer before double.
[16:04:39] jimevans: i'd more thoroughly suspect 64-bit vs. 32-bit first.
[16:04:55] jimevans: (since 64-bit windows 7 is pretty common, and 64-bit xp pretty rare)
[16:04:58] jleyba: Either way it's not a bug for us to fix :)
[16:05:15] jimevans: not sure i'd say that right away either.
[16:08:46] jimevans: we check for the variant type returned by the script execution to be either VT_I4 or VT_I8. could be we need to check something else too.

[16:24:58] lukeis: jleyba: heh.... maybe hold off about half an hour? ;)
[16:25:09] ebass: skiphuffman: it looks like the logs are not at the same point
[16:25:21] jleyba: ok
[16:25:29] ebass: line 21 on the top log maps to line 10 on the bottom
[16:26:09] skiphuffman: Up until that Line 9 there are several hundred pages of identical log entries.
[16:26:30] skiphuffman: All the way back to the beginning of the test, when the browser is opened.
[16:26:59] ebass: ok, so what is the problem you are seeing
[16:27:03] skiphuffman: (Not entirely identical.  Different datestamps and session ids and such, but otherwise exactly in step.)
[16:27:03] ebass: the log file isnt helping me much
[16:27:11] ebass: i knew what you meant

[16:27:57] jleyba: No.  I'm hoping to work on those this weekend
[16:28:03] skiphuffman: The problem I see is that I run the test from two different locations.   On one it always works. on the other it always fails.  Same test code, same system under test, same Webdriver Node and Hub.

[16:52:43] lukeis: ugh... who broke the javadoc :-/
[16:53:15] ebass: skiphuffman: the only thing i can think of is that somehow your client is not passing all of the profile information across the wire to the hub
[16:53:33] ebass: maybe the firewall on 11.04 is more restrictive
[16:53:57] dawagner: :wiki jsonwireprotocol

[16:54:20] skiphuffman: Yeah, what profile information is that?
[16:54:21] ebass: try setting a break point at the beginning of the test when the browser is initially launched
[16:54:33] ebass: the firefox profile that webdriver creates
[16:55:05] skiphuffman: Ok, I will do that.  and read the selbot text
[16:55:17] ebass: i would go to the node
[16:55:24] ebass: and inspect the profile that was created.
[16:56:00] ebass: im not 100% sure but it looks like webdriver.json is used by the webdriver.xpi firefox extension
[16:56:16] ebass: and for some reason that file didnt make it across the wire for one of the clients.
[16:57:03] ebass: i dont have webdriver running this pc so i cant check
[16:57:09] Dude-X: hey lukeis
[16:57:14] skiphuffman: So that is generated on the system that the test is run from?  Not the Node where it is actually running?
[16:57:24] jleyba: for the interactions api, why does click accept a button parameter, but mouseDown does not?
[16:57:50] lukeis: hey Dude-X 
[16:58:04] ebass: i havent poked around too much so i am not sure...but surely if the file isnt there when run from one machine to the other i would assume so.
[16:58:17] Dude-X: lukeis: would it be trouble to include the expectedConditions for python for 2.23, where you can make the modificaitons needed to be proper/
[16:58:42] ebass: because webdriver.json is loaded into a FirefoxProfile object
[16:58:44] jimevans: jleyba: for the same reason the wire protocol that it takes an element id and not a json element representation. none.
[16:58:47] lukeis: Dude-X: eh, i'm not worried about it... 2.24 should be out next week ;)
[16:58:49] ebass: when a FirefoxDriver is started.
[16:58:59] Dude-X: weekly releases for real?

[17:32:20] stephend_ has joined #selenium
[17:32:26] dawagner: I assume you don't use getLogs... My assumption is mostly founded in the fact that it currently throws an exception deep in the bowls of the firefox extension.
[17:32:46] dawagner: And the only other driver that implements it is Android.

[18:02:07] cboyce: Can the Java implementation of the WebDriver parse external test formats? I want to programmatically generate actions to store and execute later during testing, but I'm not sure the best way to do this
[18:03:19] lukeis: you can do anything you want to do that you can do in java ;)
[18:03:20] baijum has joined #selenium
[18:03:31] adamgoucher: all webdriver is is a library to control a browser… what lukeis just sais
[18:03:57] cboyce: Yeah, but I don't always know what I'm going to do ahead of time. I want to generate some tests based on the page content, and have those tests be in some resuable format
[18:04:16] lukeis: sounds like you've got some architecting to do :)
[18:04:41] cboyce: I'm not actually using selenium to test, I'm using it to map the application
[18:05:06] lukeis: that's fine... everything you've asked thus far doesn't really involve selenium (much)
[18:05:34] lukeis: replace selenium with X tool and that's the question you're asking
[18:06:03] gordolio: how long does it take before it shows up on repo1.maven.org?
[18:06:18] lukeis: up to 3 hours
[18:06:35] gordolio: ok that's fine.
[18:07:10] gordolio: thanks a bunch. :)
[18:07:15] cboyce: I'm not sure how I can be more specific. Say I have driver.findElement(By.id("submit")).click();. Can that action be serialized somehow so I can execute it on the driver later?
[18:07:51] cboyce: I could build it manually in the HTML format, but I don't know if you can parse the HTML format in to Java
[18:08:34] jimevans: cboyce: it sounds like what you want to have is some dynamically adaptable framework that will crawl the site you're examining.
[18:08:57] jimevans: and crawls it based on the contents of the current page.
[18:09:08] jimevans: then again, i'm an idiot, so what do i know.
[18:09:27] cboyce: Yes, but I need to be able to interact with form elements and JS, so Selenium seems like a good vehicle to do that
[18:09:34] lukeis: heh... let's have a fools drink next week jimevans 
[18:09:49] tessarakt2: cboyce: yes, you can "serialize" the commands
[18:10:06] tessarakt2: e.g., you can write them into a .java file, and then compile&execute that
[18:10:13] lukeis: cboyce: htmlunit / htmlunitdriver is good if you just want to crawl / click
[18:10:58] jimevans: cboyce: it is a good choice for interacting with the form elements and javascript, but anything beyond that, you'll need (to develop?) some other framework.
[18:11:19] jimevans: one with the intelligence to recognize parts of the page, and act on them.

[18:12:52] jimevans: cboyce: i don't know what you mean by "other test case formats". maybe that would be helpful to understand 
[18:13:22] cboyce: Such as HTML, or some other format that's easy to generate. 
[18:13:31] cboyce: And that I won't need to recompile to use
[18:14:17] jimevans: how do you anticipate "generating" these?
[18:14:31] jimevans: and the short answer is "no, webdriver won't do that"
[18:15:08] jimevans: you could use webdriver as a core piece of a framework that you build to do that, but it won't do it by itself. all it knows how to do is drive the browser, as has been said.
[18:15:18] cboyce: Heh, ok. I think that's the info I need. I'm basically crawling the page, so the actions/commands will be based on what I find on the page, but I want to store those actions someplace so I can rexecute them later on the same page without having to rebuild them
[18:15:54] cboyce: I mainly wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something obvious or reinventing the wheel
[18:16:15] jimevans: then it sounds like you need to architect a set of routines to do that. and if i were tasked with it, webdriver would likely be a large part of it, but it's not a competency of the library itself.
[18:16:48] cboyce: Got it. That's helpful, thanks for the info all!
[18:17:17] alexglow has joined #selenium
[18:20:13] skiphuffman: cboyce, It sounds to me like you may be confusing "selenium" with the "selenium IDE known as RIDE".   
[18:20:51] skiphuffman: Selenium is a library of browser control functions than can be called from a variety of different languages. I use python.
[18:21:51] skiphuffman: RIDE is a record and playback utility that exists as a Firefox plugin. It is most useful for learning the selenium syntax, and also for testing out low level automations before they are created in real code.

[18:53:28] lukeis: adamgoucher: a bit different actually.... look at the python example here http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html#firefox
[18:53:46] lukeis: you should be setting it on the firefox profile
[18:54:29] lukeis: what you showed is for IE ;)
[18:54:42] adamgoucher: that is from the json wire protocol
[18:54:57] lukeis: yeah... but does it *work*? :)
[18:55:16] adamgoucher: nope, but if that is what binding maintainers are supposed to be looking at...
[18:55:37] skiphuffman: Still trying to fix my problem.    It is possible that the session running the test does not have access to whereever the test is trying to create or access the webdriver.json file refereenced here:   resource /org/openqa/selenium/firefox/webdriver.json relative to org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxProfile not found.
[18:55:43] skiphuffman: Where is that file created/found?

[18:57:00] lukeis: log a bug?
[18:57:05] adamgoucher: is is the java one correct then? cus it uses the capabilities
[18:57:33] lukeis: yeah, it does magic in translating the capabilities object before it is sent
[18:59:16] skiphuffman: lukeis, That may be why these particular tests are having trouble. They modify the capabilities object before starting up the job
[18:59:31] skiphuffman: (Just changing the platform attribute.)

[19:00:03] ebass: and thats the million dollar question
[19:00:04] ebass: hehehe
[19:00:05] lukeis: skiphuffman: to answer your question, it's in the firefox  webdriver.xpi
[19:00:11] skiphuffman: I doubt firefox is even installed on the test node.
[19:00:24] ebass: haha
[19:00:32] ebass: im not sure the test would run.
[19:00:54] skiphuffman: Sorry, when I say "test node" I mean the system that is running the script.
[19:00:55] ebass: lukeis: but when that gets installed
[19:01:02] ebass: it gets installed to a firefox profile
[19:01:05] skiphuffman: The test actually runs on a different node.
[19:01:39] ebass: so long as you are still using a remotewebdriver i dont think it matters
[19:01:54] skiphuffman: I am using remote webdriver.
[19:02:00] jleyba has joined #selenium
[19:02:07] ebass: because the hub should locate the machine that has firefox installed
[19:02:10] ebass: and run the test there.
[19:02:20] skiphuffman: ebass, Exactly.
[19:02:47] skiphuffman: Our "test nodes" are minimal VMs attached to our jenkins build hub.
[19:02:53] lukeis: ebass: yep... so then you should look in the temporary folder that gets created for the firefox profile
[19:02:59] ebass: right
[19:03:01] ebass: where is that?
[19:03:02] ebass: hehehe
[19:03:06] lukeis: depends on OS

[19:04:29] skiphuffman: He?  Well, I am making an assumption
[19:04:35] skiphuffman: is that the correct pronoun?
[19:04:39] ebass: yes
[19:04:44] skiphuffman: ok, good
[19:04:48] ebass: he jsut sent an email
[19:04:53] ebass: about 2.23 release

[19:06:56] skiphuffman: so I know that the user can create it.
[19:07:13] ebass: i dont think thats the right place
[19:07:17] lukeis: ok... i would hope tmp to be world writeable on your system ;)
[19:07:20] ebass: theres probably one or more profile directoryies there.
[19:07:26] skiphuffman: me too, but I had to be sure
[19:07:42] skiphuffman: Nope, nothing that looks like a profile directory
[19:07:46] skiphuffman: unless it is hidden
[19:07:48] skiphuffman: one secod
[19:08:31] skiphuffman: Nope, nothing hidden that looks firefoxy, or seleniumy, or anything like that.
[19:08:49] lukeis: it gets a random name every time... mine was just created as /tmp/tmpRd6_fk
[19:09:09] skiphuffman: I don't see anything that would match that sort of patter
[19:09:18] skiphuffman: everything is hudson-*
[19:09:25] skiphuffman: or vmware-root
[19:09:30] lukeis: are you on the right box? :)
[19:09:33] skiphuffman: or one hsperf*
[19:09:39] skiphuffman: Yup
[19:09:49] skiphuffman: Looking at my "test node" 
[19:09:50] lukeis: is a current session running?
[19:09:59] skiphuffman: no, no current session
[19:10:02] lukeis: cause webdriver deletes the tmp profile when it's done
[19:10:05] skiphuffman: does it clean up nicely?
[19:10:06] skiphuffman: ok
[19:11:09] skiphuffman: Opened a second ssh to it and am looking in the /tmp
[19:11:17] skiphuffman: while I run a job through the first one.
[19:12:09] skiphuffman: No new directories in tmp while the test ran
[19:12:23] skiphuffman: (Assuming they were in existence for at least one second.
[19:12:25] ebass: and you are running the test from the bad client?
[19:12:33] skiphuffman: yup
[19:12:44] ebass: try running it from the good client
[19:12:50] ebass: just for reference.
[19:13:07] skiphuffman: sure
[19:13:32] ebass: thanks skip
[19:16:11] skiphuffman: Never saw a directory created.
[19:16:20] skiphuffman: Test ran successfully
[19:16:45] skiphuffman: lots of tmpxxx directories there, but none created after 8:08 this morning
[19:16:46] ebass: where are you looking for the tmp directory?
[19:17:05] skiphuffman:  in /tmp
[19:17:08] ebass: lol
[19:17:10] skiphuffman: right off the root
[19:17:13] ebass: i know
[19:17:16] ebass: bad question
[19:17:18] ebass: which machine
[19:17:26] skiphuffman: Oh, "good"
[19:17:32] skiphuffman: The one where it works
[19:17:37] ebass: ok
[19:17:44] skiphuffman: I'll call them "good" and "bad" for now
[19:18:02] ebass: but if you are using remote webdriver i would think the directory would be on the remote machine
[19:18:04] ebass: where the test is run
[19:18:11] skiphuffman: "good" is actually my desktop/development machine
[19:18:15] ebass: thats where i wanted you to look
[19:18:28] skiphuffman: I can do that.  But the remote machine is the same in both cases
[19:18:34] ebass: right
[19:18:43] skiphuffman: Remote machine is the same, Hub is the same, code is the same.
[19:18:53] skiphuffman: Still think it's useful to look?
[19:18:54] ebass:  i remember that
[19:19:28] ebass: i want to see if a directory gets created on your remote machine when you run the test from both the good and bad test driver machines
[19:19:49] skiphuffman: will do
[19:20:18] ebass: just run the test with debug and set a break point after the browser is launched
[19:20:45] ebass: or when the session is created because i imagine the browser doesnt start when running from the bad machine

[19:36:32] skiphuffman: By the way.  Neither of these systems "good" or "bad" should have any kind of special access to the test node.
[19:36:43] skiphuffman: They both just go through the hub.
[19:36:59] lukeis: Manoj: it is Beta... and getting more stable every day
[19:38:17] Manoj: yeah i understand. The execution was pretty fast like Firefox driver, but i found an issue that safari driver is not able to Fill in some fields in my App For: E.g Forms with phone numbers etc...

[19:48:55] Swadq: Hey guys, what do I do about an UnreachableBrowserException that's always being thrown at the same time? (java)
[19:50:03] skiphuffman: Swadq, what are you doing when it happens?
[19:50:22] skiphuffman: Sounds to me like you might be trying to reach a test node that is shut down.
[19:50:29] Swadq: driver.switchTo().frame(driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id='charname']/div[2]/div/div[2]/iframe")));
[19:50:41] Swadq: It throws the unreachablebrowser exception on the next calls
[19:50:43] Swadq: call*
[19:50:55] Swadq: Which is rather innocuous: 
[19:50:59] Swadq: driver.findElement(By.id("name")).sendKeys(name);
[19:51:24] skiphuffman: Well, you just changed frames.  Is the "name" element in the new frame or the old one?
[19:51:54] Swadq: In the new one
[19:52:20] skiphuffman: Ok, have you confirmed that the 'name' element .is_present and .visible?
[19:52:35] Swadq: No, let me check that
[19:53:36] forrestslater has joined #selenium
[19:53:49] Swadq: Neither of those methods are there - will .isDisplayed() work?
[19:54:05] ebass: im back
[19:55:37] skiphuffman: Swadq, Ah, sorry, .is_present is my code.
[19:55:40] forrestslater: quick question:  can I trigger css actions (like hover) with selenium?  
[19:55:43] skiphuffman:  (but I use it constantly)
[19:55:56] skiphuffman: forrestslater, quick answer "yes"
[19:55:58] ebass: you sure can
[19:55:59] bmulholland has joined #selenium
[19:56:12] Swadq: skiphuffman: UnreachableBrowserException is now thrown by .isDisplayed - so it's unreachable before it tries to look for id=name
[19:56:16] ebass: u can use the actions api to mouse over elements
[19:56:25] forrestslater: ok cool
[19:56:28] forrestslater: thank you
[19:56:31] ebass: anytime
[19:56:41] skiphuffman: Swadq,  Yeah,  .is_displayed seems right
[19:56:46] *AutomatedTester is in Assessment Training *yawn* back later
[19:57:04] ebass: skiphuffman: you were looking for the wrong file
[19:57:05] bmulholland has left #selenium
[19:57:10] ebass: its webdriver.json
[19:57:17] bmulholland has joined #selenium
[19:57:19] Swadq: It throws the exception on that call then, skiphuffman
[19:57:30] skiphuffman: Swadq, Ok, the element isn't there, possibly just not yet.  Loop .is_displayed() until it appears.
[19:57:51] Swadq: It can't check if it isDisplayed because the driver isn't available at that point
[19:58:12] ebass: so you lose the driver context when switching to an iframe
[19:58:22] skiphuffman: ebass, that is what I actually looked for    find . -iname webdriver.json   Should have cut and pasted the first time.
[19:58:26] Swadq: Yeah ebass 
[19:58:43] Swadq: That's not throwing an exception though, switching itself
[19:58:49] ebass: right
[19:58:55] ebass: its any action after you switch
[19:59:06] Swadq: Yep
[19:59:54] bmulholland: Hey all! I have a page that submits a form and am trying to wait for the next page to load. Problem being that the form simply reloads the page I'm on with a very minor change… How can I wait (using webdriver) until the page is reloaded? I found that if I wait for an element, the wait finishes immediately because the page I'm leaving already has that element!
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Jun  7 20:00:14 2012]
[20:00:14] ebass: Swadq: is your iframe named?
[20:00:33] Swadq: I'm afraid not, if it was things would be a lot simpler :( I'll give you the HTML
[20:00:38] ebass: because you should be able to just driver.switchTo.frame("name")
[20:00:40] ebass: ok
[20:01:22] ebass: swadq
[20:01:26] ebass: please use :gist
[20:01:27] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[20:01:36] Swadq: Will do
[20:01:45] Swadq: Do you just want the html for the iframe?
[20:02:01] ebass: skiphuffman: does the directory you change to look like a typical firefox profile directory?
[20:02:09] ebass: if you dont know what that looks like
[20:02:23] skiphuffman: I don't think so, but I didn't pay much attention
[20:02:35] skiphuffman: I'll redo it.  from "good" and see.
[20:03:04] ebass: go to $HOME/.mozilla/firefox/<randomgibberish>.default
[20:03:14] ebass: to get a feel for what one looks like
[20:03:50] ebass: you should have a directory in there thats either webdriver or org or something
[20:03:53] ebass: like that.
[20:04:03] ebass: not the default profile but the temporary one
[20:04:30] ebass: just give me the page html with the reference to the iframe in it.
[20:04:31] hourback has joined #selenium
[20:04:35] ebass: swadq
[20:04:46] skiphuffman: ebass,  yup, looks like a profile directory
[20:04:58] Swadq: Kk
[20:05:20] ebass: ok
[20:05:28] skiphuffman: ebass,  webdriver or or directory when created.
[20:05:29] ebass: it should have that json file in there somewhere
[20:05:42] ebass: the temporary profile that is.
[20:06:21] skiphuffman: ebass, got a "webapps" directory
[20:06:34] skiphuffman: But I never saw webdriver.json   appear

[20:13:38] Swadq: ebass?
[20:13:57] bmulholland: Does anyone have any suggestions for how to wait for a page to reload with webdriver?
[20:14:27] Swadq: Find an element that appears on reload?
[20:14:36] skiphuffman: bmulholland, just what Swadq said.
[20:15:02] bmulholland: Well yes, for sure. But the element is present before the load, so my wait immediately finishes
[20:15:11] sdqali has joined #selenium
[20:15:30] Swadq: How about sleep for 1 second after reloading, then waiting for the element to be present?
[20:15:30] skiphuffman: bmulholland, so wait for it to disappear and then wait for it to come back.
[20:15:43] sdqali: What is the status of NativeDriver? It looks like it has not seen much activity for some time.
[20:16:28] sdqali: I was planning to use the Android Native driver for some testing, but the lack of development kind of worries me
[20:16:34] bmulholland: skiphuffman: Won't that introduce brittleness? The wait for disappear will have to register in the small amount of time between when the page unloads and when it reloads
[20:17:32] skiphuffman: bmulholland, Yeah, it might.  
[20:17:45] skiphuffman: waits seem to be eternally problematic.
[20:17:53] bmulholland: True that :)
[20:18:02] skiphuffman: I spend half my time fiddling with that sort of nonsense.
[20:18:03] *adamgoucher has just realize he has /no/ idea what happens once his request hits the se server
[20:18:32] skiphuffman: Are you concerned with the page not loading at all?
[20:18:57] bmulholland: No, I don't anticipate that being an issue
[20:19:00] skiphuffman: because you could put in a 'wait for gone' 'wait for return' loop set, and just time it out after a few seconds.
[20:19:24] bmulholland: skiphuffman: ahhh, that might work too :)
[20:19:54] skiphuffman: Basically, if it doesn't disappear within X amount of time, you must have just missed the switch.
[20:20:16] bmulholland: skiphuffman: Yeah, that'll do it
[20:20:21] bmulholland: skiphuffman: Good idea!
[20:20:29] stephend: anybody familiar enough with the internals of node/grid to know what might be happening if a firefox instance is launched, says "WebDriver" in its status bar, but never gets to loading the URL?
[20:20:39] stephend: i.e just a blank window
[20:20:44] skiphuffman: but be sure to put a comment in the code so that the next maintainer (who might be future you) knows what that weird little thing is doing.
[20:20:46] stephend: with focus on the URL bar

[20:50:18] skiphuffman: When I run a test from one source PC through a hub to a test node it works. When I run the same test from a different source PC to the same hub and node, it fails.

[20:52:16] Swadq: Yup
[20:52:18] skiphuffman: It seems to be something pretty subtle.
[20:54:33] skiphuffman: I am currently guessing that the PC that is trying to run the test cannot create that webdriver.json file, so it fails to deliver it to the test node.
[20:55:11] Swadq: Have you tried reinstalling firefox/webdriver?
[20:57:41] skiphuffman: I can't do that easily.  I don't own the test nodes.  But if that is suggested by the experts (rather than just a peer), I will.
[20:59:23] Swadq: Fair enough

[21:11:50] ebass: right
[21:11:51] Swadq: I thought driver.switchTo() took a name, webelement or id?
[21:11:59] ebass: takes a name or id
[21:12:04] ebass: or a zero based index
[21:12:13] Swadq: right, there's my problem then
[21:12:21] Swadq: But it doesn't have a name or an id
[21:12:31] Swadq: I could get the index, since the page is static afaik

[21:13:48] Swadq: However it's not throwing an exception when I try to switch
[21:14:03] lukeis: means that it's a valid frame element
[21:14:03] skiphuffman: Unless anyone has something I could try in the next half hour or so.
[21:14:42] Swadq: So how could the browser die just from switching?

[21:14:58] llaskin: i think its a similar issue 
[21:15:02] llaskin: and is happening during a switch
[21:15:14] lukeis: Swadq: is it a cross domain frame?
[21:15:54] Swadq: Nope
[21:16:13] Swadq: Well, it may be
[21:16:24] Swadq: Between runescape.com and secure.runescape.com - I'd have to check
[21:16:27] lukeis: if you can provide a sample html page or link to look at we could help ya :)

[21:33:04] ebass: you could probably run the javascriptexecutor

[21:33:25] ebass: and then type into an element in the iframe.
[21:33:55] Swadq: Hmm, I have a few more things to do within the frame, but only clicking a button twice
[21:34:03] Swadq: Is that my only option?
[21:34:16] ebass: directly after you switch to the frame
[21:35:03] Swadq: But why would I be able to inject javascript but not type text?
[21:35:41] ebass: im not 100% familiar with what WebDriver does when it switches frames
[21:35:50] ebass: i just know that whenever i have any big problems with webdriver
[21:35:58] ebass: the jsexecutor saves my behind.
[21:36:42] Swadq: Haha :P Ok I'll look into that, thank you very much <3
[21:36:56] ebass: oh you know what
[21:37:09] ebass: the frame returns a webdriver
[21:37:17] ebass: your code doesnt use that webdriver.
[21:37:45] ebass: driver.switchTo().frame(driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id='charname']/div[2]/div/div[2]/iframe"))).findElement(By.id("name")).sendKeys(name);
[21:37:52] ebass: try that
[21:38:11] ebass: doh!
[21:38:34] ebass: or save that frame to WebDriver iframe  =  driver.switchTo().frame(driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id='charname']/div[2]/div/div[2]/iframe")));

[21:44:16] lukeis: ebass: the driver instances are the same
[21:44:47] lukeis: driver.switchTo().frame(....).findElement   is equivalent to driver.switchTo().frame(...);  driver.findElement
[21:45:47] Swadq: Oh no :/
[21:46:02] lukeis: and that xpath just hurts me...  just do By.cssSelector("#charname iframe")

[21:46:41] Swadq: I knew it was a bad xpath but I've never used them before so the auto generated one was the best I had

[22:09:05] ebass`afk: Swadq: have you tried checking the currentUrl after you perform the frame switch?
[22:09:14] Swadq: No, I'll do that now
[22:09:15] lukeis: Swadq: so... FF13 on my mac fails miserably after switching to the frame... but chrome works ;)
[22:09:27] *lukeis has to look into what's going on with FF
[22:09:43] Swadq: Ok, I'm using a mac too. How can I use a chrome webdriver? I get an exception when I try

[22:10:14] Swadq: ah 
[22:10:16] Swadq: Thank you
[22:10:26] Swadq: Where is the system path?

[22:10:45] lukeis: any of the directories that are listed from e`echo $PATH` :)
[22:10:52] ebass`afk: export PATH=<binarylocation>:$PATH
[22:10:52] Swadq: That damn thing :p
[22:11:03] ebass`afk: or append it to the end
[22:11:22] ebass`afk: remember if you only do that in the shell then the path isnt set for the system
[22:11:26] ebass`afk: just whatever is running in that shell
[22:11:47] lukeis: is why i usally recommend a dir in the existing path ;)
[22:11:53] ebass`afk: which is fine, so long as that is where you are starting the webdriver server
[22:12:11] Swadq: Ok now I'm confused :/

[22:12:32] lukeis: ebass`afk: um, not really i don't think you follow me :)
[22:12:41] Swadq: How can I get the current directories in the path?
[22:12:46] ebass`afk: just put the binary in one of the folders listed when u type echo $PATH
[22:13:00] Swadq: kk
[22:13:12] lukeis: Swadq: just put it in /usr/bin   (sudo mv ~/Downloads/chromedriver /usr/bin)
[22:13:31] ebass`afk: you can add any directory you want to the path...if thats where the selenium server looks
[22:14:27] Swadq: Alright, let me test to see if this works :)
[22:14:29] ebass`afk: then either export the path on the shell where you start the server or export the shell in one of the shell configuration files
[22:15:05] Swadq: Ok it's setting up and everything
[22:15:15] Swadq: I just hope that it switches frames without fail :)
[22:16:16] ebass`afk: i imagine it will if it worked for lukeis
[22:16:29] ebass`afk: sounds like something broke iframe switching in firefox
[22:16:42] ebass`afk: or maybe even just frame switching
[22:16:42] Swadq: In which case, I'm not as much of a fool as I thought :3
[22:16:51] ebass`afk: i never thought u were.
[22:16:57] Swadq: It worked :) Thank you

[23:00:00] kamoricks: I fixed it by doing a moveto() command followed by a click(), because moveto() still moves to the center.

[23:01:22] dawagner: AutomatedTester: Can I report a bug about that page to you? :P

[23:02:28] AutomatedTester: but do you think my idea is silly?
[23:02:47] *AutomatedTester thinks there is bound to be a ton of edge cases
[23:02:56] jimevans: that would be my thought too.
[23:03:45] jimevans: that's actually one of the reasons the interactions api was introduced in the first place, to handle cases where the base click didn't work

[23:51:36] stephend: that is driving me nuts
[23:51:51] stephend: stupid blank firefox windows
[23:52:02] stephend: and behind it, a hanged process that we have to force-quit EVERY TIME
[23:52:32] stephend: AutomatedTester: I heard your old manager sucked
[23:52:49] AutomatedTester: stephend: apparently but my first was cool too
[23:52:54] dawagner: stephend: You don't kill VMs after tests?
[23:53:01] stephend: dawagner: I wish
[23:53:15] stephend: dave hunt is working with his team + AutomatedTester's on that
[23:53:15] stephend: using ESX
[23:53:19] stephend: I think we're hitting memory limits or leaks
[23:53:19] dawagner: That's a recipe for pain :(
[23:53:23] stephend: I've actually seen OOM thrown
[23:53:31] stephend: dawagner: and this is across 6 mac minis, with 4 VMs...
[23:53:32] stephend: yeah
[23:53:38] AutomatedTester: dawagner: time and money :/
[23:53:45] stephend: grid doesn't log anything useful
[23:53:49] lukeis: dawagner: i finally got a grid last week.... (finally)... static vm's... and all of them have FF3.6 only on them :-P
[23:53:49] stephend: are there log levels?
[23:53:59] dawagner: Starting and stopping VMs from snapshots takes at most X seconds
[23:54:15] AutomatedTester: dawagner: thats what we are going to do
[23:55:02] AutomatedTester: stephend: also my old old manager ignores requests for swish swish
[23:55:11] AutomatedTester: its like he has foresaken me
[23:55:11] stephend: hahah
[23:55:25] stephend: no, he's just scatter-brained, sadly
[23:55:33] stephend: it's like I know him, or something!
[23:55:42] stephend: next time you're in town, I'll tell him to make it a priority!
[23:55:53] lukeis: isn't that like in 2 weeks?
[23:56:04] AutomatedTester: stephend: in a couple weeks time I am back in town
[23:56:08] stephend: awesome
[23:56:11] stephend: I'll be here
[23:56:15] stephend: I mean, he'll be here
[23:56:20] lukeis: heh
[23:56:23] *AutomatedTester needs to reorg his hotels though
[23:56:33] *AutomatedTester is only in MV for part of the week
[23:56:37] AutomatedTester: and SF for the other parts
[23:57:38] *AutomatedTester giggled at one of the "prefered" hotels that came up
[23:57:41] AutomatedTester: $500 per night
[23:57:54] stephend: AutomatedTester: I stayed at st martins lane in london
[23:57:56] stephend: was nice :-)
[23:57:58] stephend: 5-star hotel
[23:58:08] AutomatedTester: stephend: it was nice but over priced for what you got
[23:58:23] stephend|mtg: can't beat the proximity to the office, though!
[23:58:26] stephend|mtg: :-P
[23:58:42] *stephend|mtg misses London
[23:58:48] AutomatedTester: stephend|mtg: that is true
