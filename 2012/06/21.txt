[12:12:56] moo-_-: Gungy: if you mean browser rendering output you have screen capturing feature

[12:34:25] faille: it finds the tr#dimension0
[12:34:31] faille: but dimension1 doesnt work
[12:34:57] jimevans: does it wait for 30 full seconds before timing out?
[12:35:22] jimevans: or does it fail right away?
[12:36:01] faille: full timeout
[12:36:25] jimevans: also, what happens if you simply find the <tr> element instead of the inputs inside it?
[12:36:40] jimevans: s/simply find/try to simply find/
[12:37:17] jimevans: i'm wondering if it's not finding the <tr> or one of the descendent elements you're including in the selector.
[12:38:23] faille: ok let me try
[12:38:34] jimevans: another question: what version of IE do you see the problem on? using css selectors use different engines for css selection based on IE version.
[12:39:11] faille: IE9
[12:39:38] jimevans: if it's IE8 or 9, you can manually test to see if the selector is valid in the F12 Developer Tools
[12:39:53] jimevans: using the javascript console

[19:35:47] Chuckleteeth: so i can show it being broken
[19:37:33] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: i was wrong yesterday, by the way. you can get access to an element's parent driver.
[19:37:41] jimevans: (in .NET, that is)
[19:37:45] Chuckleteeth: ooo how is that?
[19:37:53] jimevans: cast it to IWrapsDriver.
[19:38:03] Chuckleteeth: lol ok, let me try that
[19:38:20] AJ___ has joined #selenium
[19:38:21] jimevans: that gives you the WrappedDriver property.
[19:38:29] Chuckleteeth: thanks for looking into that for me
[19:38:38] lukeis: you can in python too
[19:38:39] jimevans: it's right there in the source code.
[19:38:51] Chuckleteeth: one of these days i'll download the source code and contribute... but not this day
[19:39:07] Chuckleteeth: too much to do at work atm
[19:39:23] jimevans: funny thing is, i wrote most of the source code, and i still didn't remember that one.
[19:39:45] lukeis: java has it too... on the concrete class, not the interface
[19:39:50] Chuckleteeth: heh, sometimes i look at code i wrote a few months ago...say to myself, what dummy wrote this mess and then check svn...doh
[19:40:12] Chuckleteeth: so i have a differant issue today
[19:40:19] Chuckleteeth: firefox will not click a link
[19:40:28] Chuckleteeth: ive ripped out the condition into a static page

[19:40:41] Chuckleteeth: then maybe someone in here can have a go at it
[19:41:09] jimevans: okay. when you're ready, share the page source and your webdriver code, and i'll take a look.\
[19:43:39] Chuckleteeth: ok where should i paste this? its not 100% reduced but i think its small enough
[19:44:04] Chuckleteeth: the problem i think is that the css has an a:hover that changes the color

[19:45:26] Chuckleteeth: https://gist.github.com/2967707
[19:45:28] Chuckleteeth: ok thats the html
[19:45:45] Chuckleteeth: the test is simply to goto the page and do this :
[19:45:45] Chuckleteeth: driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector("#slider-code li.comment:nth-child(1) a")).Click();
[19:46:00] Chuckleteeth: i can see it highlights the element but does not redirect to google

[19:46:22] chrisculver701: thanks for the work on it
[19:46:27] jimevans: alright. give me a second to look.
[19:46:52] klrmn: Chuckleteeth: thanks for boiling this down for them to look at…the answer might explain why half of my clicks dont' work…i just don't have the background to be able to boil the html/css down to smallest replicating set

[19:53:39] jimevans: oh, hang on.
[19:54:12] Chuckleteeth: when you say it worked, as in it redirected to google?
[19:54:25] Chuckleteeth: or it managed to find the element?

[20:11:08] newbee: with selenium 2
[20:11:13] newbee: whats the best way to ? 
[20:11:56] Chuckleteeth: actions
[20:12:09] lukeis: newbee: is the list a multi-select box? or custom ui?
[20:12:12] Chuckleteeth: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/AdvancedUserInteractions
[20:12:36] newbee: its a thumbnail viewer
[20:12:41] newbee: i can multiselect

[20:12:49] newbee: here is what i have tried so far: 
[20:12:50] lukeis: ah, ok
[20:12:56] newbee: driver.keyboard.PressKey(Keys.Shift);. driver.keyboard.PressKey(Keys.ArrowRight): driver.keyboard.ReleaseKey(Keys.Shift); 
[20:13:09] newbee: but this only works in Chrome not in IE or FF
[20:13:18] Chuckleteeth: goto the link
[20:13:21] newbee: Actions a = new Actions(driver); a.KeyDown(Keys.Shift).MoveToElement(WebDriverSetup.driver.FindElementByXPath(ThumbnailViewerUI.second_thumbnail),0,0).Click().Perform();
[20:13:23] Chuckleteeth: you can send key down
[20:13:24] Chuckleteeth: on the shift

[20:14:27] newbee: its as if the keypress(rt arrow) moves releases the shift key
[20:14:33] Chuckleteeth: what does it end up doing, pressing and  releasing shift, then clicking on the element?
[20:14:38] lukeis: i've had tons of trouble trying to multiselect custom components like this...
[20:14:47] newbee: it looks like
[20:14:51] newbee: atleast in IE and FF
[20:14:54] lukeis: advanced user interactions still need a lot of work
[20:15:14] newbee: anything that worked for you ? 
[20:15:23] lukeis: i typically end up just writing my own Javascript and execute it
[20:15:27] newbee: i can do a lasso too to multiselect
[20:15:33] newbee: but not sure how to do that
[20:15:43] newbee: .. how would be javascript to multiselect look like? 
[20:15:56] lukeis: all depends on the javascript on your page ;)
[20:16:03] Chuckleteeth: well you can evoke the javascript thats already on your page
[20:16:11] newbee: hmm so i will need some dev help on this one? 
[20:16:17] lukeis: likely
[20:16:28] Chuckleteeth: are they completely custom components?
[20:16:55] newbee: yes
[20:18:12] Chuckleteeth: hey
[20:18:16] Chuckleteeth: did you try using LShift
[20:18:25] Chuckleteeth: Keys.LShift instead of Keys.Shift
[20:19:10] Chuckleteeth: im not sure how keyup and down is supposed to behave with ambigious key definition
[20:19:25] newbee: how does Lshift differ from Shift? 
[20:19:32] Chuckleteeth: LShift is a key
[20:19:36] Chuckleteeth: shift is just ...either 
[20:19:48] Chuckleteeth: LShift is the left one
[20:19:51] Chuckleteeth: RShift is the right one
[20:20:06] Chuckleteeth: Shift i think is key independentent message 
[20:20:11] Chuckleteeth: have a go
[20:20:38] newbee: let me try.. as we chat.. 
[20:20:56] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: hah! found it. the firefox driver treats anchor (<a>) elements different from other elements when determining where to click. this is to solve the problem where the anchor is a normal anchor (without other child elements), and the text would include a line break.
[20:21:42] jimevans: but you've got a very special anchor here, and the first rect returned by the javascript function element.getClientRects() probably resolves to a rect that isn't clickable.
[20:21:45] Chuckleteeth: you mean if the A element contained text with a line break in it, and it would try to click in the middle of hte element which is essentially inbetween the 2 lines?
[20:22:13] jimevans: that's the problem the different treatment of <a> elements solves, so that case will work properly.
[20:22:51] Chuckleteeth: how hard would it be to determine where its actually attempting to click?
[20:22:53] jimevans: what happens if you change your selector to: "#slider-code li.comment:nth-child(1) a div"
[20:23:07] Chuckleteeth: let me try
[20:23:15] AutomatedTester: lukeis: updated
[20:23:18] jimevans: i'd bet it works.

[20:26:20] Chuckleteeth: yeah it worked
[20:26:32] Chuckleteeth: but shouldn't we try fixing this?
[20:26:44] jimevans: you're welcome to give it a go.
[20:26:55] Chuckleteeth: oh man
[20:26:56] jimevans: i don't touch the firefox driver innards.
[20:27:01] Chuckleteeth: who wrote it?
[20:27:24] Chuckleteeth: i haven't touched c++ in at least 3 years
[20:27:41] newbee: hmm not working ... 
[20:27:48] newbee: and this is really frustrating
[20:28:17] jimevans: firefox is mostly javascript
[20:28:17] AutomatedTester: ok I am missing something
[20:28:27] AutomatedTester: how do I join that group?
[20:28:39] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/firefox-driver/js/wrappedElement.js#55 is the click element function
[20:28:55] jimevans: it calls down into Utils.getLocation at line 77
[20:29:43] opapo has joined #selenium
[20:29:47] jimevans: that function can be found at http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/firefox-driver/js/utils.js#725
[20:29:53] newbee: lukies@ can you show me a sample of your code to do multiselect
[20:30:01] jimevans: in there, you can see exactly where the special handling of <a> elements is.
[20:30:22] Chuckleteeth: ok i can try running some of this js in an immediate window
[20:30:36] Chuckleteeth: see if anything fishy is coming up, my team is actually in the middle of planning tho i should probably join them :P
[20:31:10] jimevans: well, that's where the problem is, and you now have a workaround.
[20:39:34] Chuckleteeth: yeah
[20:39:52] Chuckleteeth: element.getClientRects()[0] returns an object with width = 0
[20:40:50] klrmn: Chuckleteeth, jimevans: and this happens when there are other elements inside the <a>, or some other more specific configuration?
[20:40:55] *klrmn tries to learn
[20:41:02] Chuckleteeth: it appears so
[20:41:05] munro has joined #selenium
[20:41:33] jimevans: specifically for firefox, when there are other block elements inside the <a>. inline elements aren't likely to cause the problem, i don't think.
[20:42:16] rstrazhnyk has joined #selenium
[20:42:19] klrmn: block elements would be divs and spans, but not what?
[20:42:33] Chuckleteeth: so i think i know a fix we can use
[20:42:50] munro: is it possible to access my application's JS inside .waitForCondition?  I really want to do things along the lines of .waitForCondition('$.isReady', 5000)
[20:43:18] Chuckleteeth: let me get some learn on first tho
[20:43:22] jimevans: klrmn: <span> elements are inline.
[20:44:28] Chuckleteeth: so atm it uses getClientRects and just uses the first one in the case of <a> elements
[20:44:45] Chuckleteeth: why not make it fall back to getBoundingClientRects if the resulting rect has a zero width or height
[20:44:56] Chuckleteeth: since getBoundingClientRects returned a valid width for me
[20:44:59] AutomatedTester: klrmn: unrelated, did you get to run the tests?
[20:45:53] munro: right now the only conceivable way for me poll my internal application is to modify the DOM .runScript('$(function () { $('body').append($('<div>').attr('id', 'it-has-happened')); }).waitForCondition('selenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow().document.getElementById("it-has-happened")', 50000)
[20:46:51] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: in your case, does the first rect returned by getClientRects() have a zero width and/or height?
[20:47:12] Chuckleteeth: yes
[20:47:14] Chuckleteeth: 0 width
[20:47:22] klrmn: AutomatedTester: i succeeded in building, it did not really give me enough output for me to tell if it ran the tests or not, but my manual testing tells me that i made some of the changes in a place that doesn't get called…so i asked for help, got a pointer to another file, which pointed back around to the file i thought…so i'm back in holding pattern
[20:47:32] Chuckleteeth: which it will then return, and attempt to click in the middle of
[20:48:20] Chuckleteeth: so 0 pixels was right next to the A element without being over it which allowed at least the css hover to trigger
[20:48:28] Chuckleteeth: since the hover is over the parent element
[20:48:50] jimevans: well, there you go. slap all of this analysis into an issue report, and file a :new issue.
[20:48:53] Chuckleteeth: i suppose its bad to have that hover on an element slightly larger then what you can actualy click on
[20:48:59] jimevans: bah. autocorrect sucks
[20:49:06] Chuckleteeth: can't you just commit something?

[20:49:29] Chuckleteeth: thats why i now come here
[20:49:49] Chuckleteeth: like that page scroll issue, hell you solved and pushed a build in a matter of hours
[20:49:57] Chuckleteeth: i hope you get paid for this
[20:50:19] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: that's because it's in code that i know, and maintain. and no, i don't get paid for this. none of us do.
[20:50:28] Chuckleteeth: : (
[20:50:48] *adamgoucher will be happy to take Chuckleteeth's money though
[20:50:57] jimevans: i don't know the firefox code that well, so i'm not comfortable just throwing a fix out there.
[20:51:15] Chuckleteeth: do we have tests that cover this stuff?
[20:51:34] llaskin: adam: next year he pays you, 2 peanuts.
[20:52:21] Chuckleteeth: well i do want to get involved but im sure there are alot of tools and systems you guys use that im not familiar with
[20:52:25] jimevans: that cover the specific case of embedded elements? dunno. i'd have to look.
[20:54:01] munro: ahhh, I figured it out, I was using `getCurrentWindow` and not `getUserWindow`

[21:10:31] klrmn: if you have a remote driver in your hand, is there a way to interrogate it to ask it if it supports native events?
[21:12:11] jimevans: klrmn: which language?
[21:12:36] klrmn: python, preferably
[21:12:54] jimevans: hmm… don't know the python bindings that well. lukeis?
[21:13:01] jimevans: AutomatedTester?
[21:13:31] AutomatedTester: sorry was doing day job, havent even read klrmn reply :)
[21:13:44] klrmn: no worries
[21:14:43] santiycr: davehunt: yt?
[21:14:48] jimevans: in .net, it's "cast the driver to IHasCapabilities and use the Capabilities property."
[21:14:55] davehunt: santiycr: not really
[21:14:59] davehunt: dinner is on :)
[21:15:02] jimevans: Java is probably similar.
[21:15:25] davehunt: santiycr: is it quick?
[21:15:26] klrmn: i've discovered that some of the mozilla native tests fail in a way that doesn't specifically have 'native' written all over it if the remote selenium driver doesn't have native enabled…so i was thinking about having davehunt's pytest-mozwebqa skip the tests if they are marked native and the driver in it's hand doesn't support it
[21:16:17] davehunt: klrmn: but that's what we currently do, with -m 'not native'
[21:16:27] santiycr: I'm working on pytest-mozwebqa
[21:16:36] santiycr: davehunt: ^^
[21:16:40] davehunt: santiycr: 'working on'?
[21:16:49] santiycr: davehunt: tests are failing, so I don't want to send a pull request :)
[21:17:06] santiycr: found a small bug, and made an improvement
[21:17:07] davehunt: what are you adding?
[21:17:12] davehunt: okay, cool
[21:17:17] klrmn: yes, but i want it to do it conditionally only if the driver doesn't support native
[21:17:23] klrmn: not just eliminating them period
[21:17:28] davehunt: 11th hour, it better be safe :P
[21:17:42] santiycr: heh
[21:17:48] AutomatedTester: shit sorry klrmn
[21:17:58] santiycr: added auth tokens to links, so that they work on non-public jobs
[21:18:05] santiycr: for the reports of sauce tests
[21:18:06] davehunt: santiycr: nice
[21:18:21] davehunt: but what if the report is made public?
[21:18:22] klrmn: yay making pytest-mozwebqa work better with sauce =)
[21:18:46] santiycr: good question :)
[21:18:58] santiycr: anyone with the report will be able to see the jobs it links to
[21:18:59] davehunt: santiycr: one test may fail btw, check travis to see how it's run
[21:19:15] davehunt: santiycr: that's not necessarily ideal :)
[21:19:21] santiycr: though, I'm guessing the info in the report is as sensitive as the job data on sauce
[21:19:29] AutomatedTester: klrmn: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py#679 will tell you what is available when you have a session
[21:19:34] davehunt: santiycr: that depends
[21:19:45] davehunt: we use public/private marks
[21:19:53] davehunt: and default to the restricted public
[21:20:05] santiycr: hm, I see
[21:20:22] AutomatedTester: klrmn: when you create a session you send it a few capabilities and when the session is created it gets updated
[21:20:26] davehunt: anyway, submit a pull and I'll look over it :)
[21:20:39] klrmn: AutomatedTester: thanks!
[21:21:28] santiycr: done :)
[21:22:43] davehunt: klrmn: I believe that will tell you if native events are enabled, but not if they're supported by the host platform (but I may be wrong). Even so, it doesn't resolve your problem with passing tests being skipped (or marked as expected to fail)
[21:24:50] davehunt: I suggest adding conditional xfails for tests that are expected to fail on a specific platform. See http://pytest.org/latest/skipping.html#evaluation-of-skipif-xfail-conditions
[21:25:53] bmulholland_: does anyone know how to test if an element is present in web driver on neustar? webDriver.isElementPresent doesn't seem to exist
[21:26:33] klrmn: davehunt: this is because i had failing tests on *windows* because i forgot to enable native events on the selenium server
[21:26:41] bmulholland_: their documentation is horrid, too :(
[21:26:42] AutomatedTester: bmulholland_: thats because webdriver doesnt have isElementPresent
[21:26:58] AutomatedTester: only Selenum does
[21:27:20] bmulholland_: I'm not familiar with the difference, there?
[21:27:26] bmulholland_: how would I access the method, then?
[21:27:39] Chuckleteeth: ok i made an issue, but how long do you think it would be before someone looks at it?
[21:27:59] AutomatedTester: bmulholland_: Webdriver is a different API to Selenium
[21:28:01] Chuckleteeth: im trying to get my tests greened up, and id rather not go and refactor a bunch around this if i know it would be fixed in a short amount of time
[21:28:40] AutomatedTester: webdriver will throw an error if you using find_element and the element isnt on the page
[21:29:19] bmulholland: AutomatedTester: Yeah, that's fair… how would I check to see if the element is present, then? given that I only have access to a web driver object
[21:29:57] klrmn: bmulholland you'd use your client language's version of try/catch
[21:30:07] lukeis: bmulholland:  findElements  <-   "s"    and check the length is 0
[21:31:03] AutomatedTester: bmulholland: try: driver.find_element(By.ID, "foobar") except ElementNotFoundException: #not found

[21:34:55] AJ___: Can someone tell me where should I use the java bindings? I have been using selenium for sometime now.. i write code in java and use only the servr jar. never really understood why do we need java bindings?
[21:35:54] lukeis: um, if you're using WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); <- that IS using the java bindings
[21:37:10] lukeis: definition of bindings in Selenium == programming language that implements a wrapper around the JSONWireProtocol which is used to control a browser that is running selenium/webdriver
[21:40:28] AJ___: Oh ok.. I didn't knew i was using java binding when i say new FirefoxDriver.. So javabindings come along with the selenium.server jar?
[21:42:26] lukeis: yes
[21:44:07] AJ___: The download page says this for java binding - Download this if you plan on just using the client-side pieces of Selenium
[21:44:56] AJ___: I still don't understand it sorry.. any person who is using selenium will have to download the jar isn't it? Or am I wrong there?
[21:44:59] lukeis: the zip file linked contains just the things you need to compile / run your project... not everything that is in the selenium-server-standalone

[22:00:03] jimevans: not really.
[22:00:07] Chuckleteeth: it doesn't?
[22:00:31] jimevans: it'll probably default to ".NET" which doesn't really have any meaningful build targets.
[22:02:10] jimevans: and, well, that's a bit of a lie too, because if you try to build with win32, you need to have the gecko sdks for the firefox native components.

[22:18:46] newbee has joined #selenium
[22:19:00] newbee: Hello group.. i was here earlier tyring to get a solution for this: 
[22:19:11] newbee: This is what i am trying to achieve   1. Click on the first element in a list. 2. Press the <shift> keys and hold it down.  3. Using the right arrow key/mouse click, select the elements next to the first element. 
[22:19:23] newbee: I have tried these two approaches with the following problems:   driver.keyboard.PressKey(Keys.Shift);. driver.keyboard.PressKey(Keys.ArrowRight): driver.keyboard.ReleaseKey(Keys.Shift);
[22:19:28] newbee: Problem: This works great in IE and Chrome, but in Firefox it just clicks on the first element and then moves the selection with the arrow key instead of keeping the multi-select. Is this a known issue
[22:19:42] newbee: The other approach is:   Actions a = new Actions(driver); a.KeyDown(Keys.Shift).MoveToElement(WebDriverSetup.driver.FindElementByXPath(ThumbnailViewerUI.second_thumbnail),0,0).Click().Perform();  In this the selection moves with the click, instead being multiselect it just selects the second element
[22:19:49] newbee: Am i missing something? please let me know how I can go about doing this. 
[22:21:20] jimevans: i can't say it's an issue that *I* know about, but your approach looks solid with using the Actions class. nevertheless, i wouldn't be surprised if shift-click and control-click weren't working properly for some set of browsers.
[22:22:21] newbee: well the actions approach does not work at all 
[22:22:32] newbee: the first atleast works for the chrome atelast
[22:22:35] newbee: atleast*
[22:23:01] jimevans: using the keyboard and mouse implementations directly off the driver is highly discouraged.
[22:23:25] jimevans: or so I'
[22:23:32] jimevans: or so i'm lead to believe.
[22:23:49] newbee: hmm how would you approach it then? 
[22:23:54] jimevans: using actions.
[22:23:59] newbee: cause the actions does not work at all
[22:24:10] jimevans: if it doesn't work, it doesn't work, but that's the "correct" way to do it.
[22:24:31] newbee: i would like to keep the shift key pressed and then send the arrow right key 
[22:24:39] newbee: 5 times to select 5 elements 
[22:25:03] newbee: i agree its the correct way..since it was not working i was experiementing with other approaches.. 
[22:25:08] newbee: experimenting*
[22:26:06] jimevans: i'm pretty sure the native event code doesn't handle this case correctly yet (which means it won't work for IE, or firefox on windows).
[22:26:37] newbee: hmm can you think of any work around for this? 
[22:27:13] jimevans: not off the top of my head.
[22:27:29] jimevans: use synthesized events?
[22:27:32] jimevans: maybe?
[22:27:56] newbee: hmm not sure what that means
[22:28:26] jimevans: turn native events off when you instantiate your driver (this should work for firefox)
[22:28:31] jimevans: hang on.
[22:29:39] jimevans: newbee: you're using what language?
[22:30:13] newbee: C#
[22:31:21] jimevans: then create a FirefoxProfile object, set the EnableNativeEvents property to false, and use that FirefoxProfile object as a parameter to the FirefoxDriver constructor.
[22:32:47] jimevans: see if that solves the problem
[22:34:11] newbee: let me see if that helps
[22:35:48] newbee: hmm i have created a profile on the firefox node that i have to use ... due to some custom extensions to this profile
[22:35:57] santiycr: jimevans: ping
[22:36:08] jimevans: santiycr: pong
[22:36:16] santiycr: hi :)

[22:36:37] jimevans: newbee: you're using grid/remote? that would've nice to know up front. 
[22:36:44] santiycr: a user reported a problem with IE9, have you seen this before?
[22:36:45] jimevans: santiycr: s'up?

[22:36:57] newbee: hmm sorry should have mentioned that 
[22:37:18] jimevans: santiycr: um, no?

[22:38:27] santiycr: oh, just noticed this is running on 2.18.0
[22:38:30] nsussman has joined #selenium
[22:38:40] santiycr: let's see if this is still there on 2.24.0
[22:38:55] newbee: jimevans @ what is confusing is that the second approach with the keyboard i.e. works fine with chrome ... as you said might be a native events issue
[22:42:11] newbee has joined #selenium
[22:43:03] newbee: anyother suggestions? 
[22:45:20] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[22:45:23] davehunt: santiycr: ping
[22:45:33] santiycr: davehunt: yup
[22:46:34] davehunt: santiycr: why did you change capabilities to setting in your pull. The former works just fine, and settings would be undefined
[22:46:52] santiycr: really? pyflakes said the oposite for me
[22:46:53] santiycr: let me see
[22:47:07] davehunt: odd
[22:47:38] newbee: so guys any other way to do multi select element in Selenium 2
[22:47:40] santiycr: you sure? I changed the rc_client one, not the wd
[22:47:59] *davehunt checks
[22:48:26] santiycr: davehunt: just managed to run the tests and discovered a bug in my pull request, btw
[22:48:31] santiycr: not there, but in the auth link 
[22:49:08] davehunt: yeah, and I was looking in the wrong file. settings looks right - well spotted :)
[22:49:15] santiycr: tks :)
[22:49:32] santiycr: just found I'm using self.credentials inside the Job class, which is not right
[22:49:34] davehunt: so I'm guessing your questions are all answered by you digging around in the code? :P
[22:49:51] santiycr: indeed, most of them are :)
[22:50:02] davehunt: cool
[22:50:10] santiycr: though, wonder if some of them should just be answered in the blog post, for saving the work to the readers 
[22:50:47] davehunt: yeah, although the blog was meant to be an announcement and what it does, and the readme should serve as how to use it.
[22:51:31] davehunt: maybe you could do a blog post on how to use it with sauce? :P
[22:51:43] davehunt: or I could guest blog for sauce?
[22:52:15] santiycr: that'd be awesome :)
[22:52:22] santiycr: when do you want to do that?
[22:52:44] santiycr: or I can do it if you'd like, but I think you'd be ideal, as the creator
[22:53:04] davehunt: I can take a look next week some time
[22:53:20] santiycr: great
[22:53:36] santiycr: I'll make awilson820 bug you :)

[22:54:28] davehunt: cool. glad you like it :D
[22:54:32] newbee: i was discussing a problem with one of the group members here.. can either of you take a look at this.. i am really trying to get this working today.. https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!starred/selenium-users/MK9tjbwdSMg
[22:55:07] davehunt: santiycr: even though 1.0 isn't out yet, the beta 0.10 has 288 downloads already
[22:55:08] davehunt: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-mozwebqa
[22:55:19] davehunt: I keep hearing from people that are using it..
[22:55:28] santiycr: davehunt: awesome
[22:55:42] santiycr: davehunt: I think you're right on announcement vs docs when it comes to the blog post
[22:57:08] remo: webdriver api -  using firefox profile to launch browser   - after which the api's  cannot communicate iwth the web forms - ?
[22:57:54] davehunt: santiycr: answered your questions

[23:13:17] davehunt: santiycr: had any luck with mozdownload/mozinstall?
[23:14:23] santiycr: davehunt: been out of focus on that for a while :(
[23:14:48] davehunt: I guessed as much, hopefully because you're so busy on other cool and exciting things :)
[23:15:05] santiycr: davehunt: heh, that's correct
[23:15:16] santiycr: I'm working on speeding at least 5 things that are awesome
[23:15:27] santiycr: one is considerably speeding up the Selenium project tests 
[23:15:39] santiycr: another one is getting browsermob proxy in our service
[23:15:45] santiycr: hopefully happening in the next few weeks
[23:16:08] davehunt: that's very cool
[23:16:22] santiycr: sadly, my day is determined by my inbox, when I get to work in the morning
[23:16:32] santiycr: pretty excited about those two
[23:17:07] bmulholland: Hey, I'm trying to install py.saunter and am getting "No local packages or download links found for pytest-marks>=0.3"… any idea what's going on?
[23:17:14] santiycr: also, I'm preparing sauce to work well with a Sauce Labs - Selenium grid plugin that francois kickstarted in SeConf
[23:17:24] bmulholland: adam's pytest-marks github repo seems to only have version 0.2
[23:17:42] santiycr: will let you set Sauce as a node in your grid, so that you can fall back to it
[23:18:02] santiycr: for stuff like missing platforms, or low resources
[23:18:21] davehunt: santiycr: yeah, that's neat
[23:18:31] JackDandy has joined #selenium
[23:18:38] davehunt: bmulholland: I thought the features of that plugin made it into pytest
[23:18:43] davehunt: or was that markfiltration
[23:18:49] alexglow has joined #selenium
[23:18:59] bmulholland: it very well may have… but the py.saunter install script still looks for pytest-marks
[23:19:07] bmulholland: Requirement.parse('pytest-marks>=0.3')
[23:19:18] davehunt: I'm not familiar with py.saunter
[23:19:51] bmulholland: adamgoucher: Do you know how I can fix that dependency?
[23:34:58] Siph0n has joined #selenium
[23:36:38] Siph0n: Does anyone know how to get chromedriver to not print out the port,  version, and that its starting everytime a new test starts. I want to turn it off completely 
[23:41:14] dawagner has joined #selenium
[23:41:59] klrmn: Siph0n: pipe the output to /dev/null?
[23:44:27] klrmn: so, i've just spent 3 days trying to troubleshoot a mozilla project's native events, and my end-point observation is - if you run a test that requires native events on a mac, and it can't do it, it throws an error that says so, but if you run a test on a remote selenium server on windows that does not have native events enabled, the actions just don't work, and no error is thrown
[23:45:15] bmulholland: klrmn: things that don't work without errors are my favourite type of issue
[23:46:41] bmulholland: for the record, the issue with pytest-marks not installing version 0.3 was probably because python 2.6 was installed, whereas version 0.3 requires 2.7
