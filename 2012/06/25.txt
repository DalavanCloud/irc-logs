[IRC logfile - Started Mon Jun 25 12:03:59 2012]
[12:03:59] foolx: dawagner: when you visit a page, thats protected and just for authenticated users, you get a popup with login/username. This happens during driver.get(), so you can't access it afterwards, no command is executed. I already found stuff like http://username:pw@www.url.com, but that won't work, he simply drops the username:pw stuff and opens url.com and asks for username and pw.

[13:24:11] hourback has joined #selenium
[13:24:38] AutomatedTester: interesting...
[13:24:45] dawagner: Because everything in JS can change types, they use a bit to indicate whether a value is on the heap (almost everything), or a 31-bit-or-smaller integer which they can store on the stack

[17:21:28] Dude-X: the title of the bug is confusing
[17:21:38] Dude-X: seems like the original poster is arguing that Firefox is wrong
[17:22:12] jimevans: Dude-X: i don't really care about the original poster.
[17:23:30] simonstewart: If he wants to get the property, he can use the js executor, jimevans
[17:23:31] jimevans: the point is that there's been a decision made about the way the API works, and the commenter in question doesn't agree with the decision. i respect that. he can even make a cogent argument that we made the wrong decision. but he's done it like a douche.
[17:23:38] Dude-X: but i see that you're responding to the last point
[17:23:57] jimevans: simonstewart: i agree entirely.
[17:24:09] simonstewart: So if there's behaviour he wants, it's easy to implement
[17:24:19] simonstewart: He will, of course, find that the behaviour differs between browsers
[17:25:39] jimevans: but what i'm marveling at is the ability of people to be absolutely dickish in their refusal to listen to opposing viewpoints.
[17:26:00] dawagner: jimevans: To be fair to him, he's being the same kind of douche that we occasionally are with such things...
[17:26:09] jimevans: oh, i know i can be.
[17:26:10] simonstewart: dawagner in particular 
[17:26:13] simonstewart: :)
[17:26:16] dawagner: :p
[17:27:11] dawagner: He's arguing a very similar style as we argue when we tell people "We aren't going to add this to the API"
[17:27:48] simonstewart: Why don't you go fuck yourself, "gclient sync"?

[17:28:10] simonstewart: Can't find gconf.pc
[17:28:19] jimevans: i'm sure the frustration with which making a cogent argument fails to change minds is a two-way street
[17:28:27] dawagner: gclient runhooks --force ; gclient sync --force
[17:28:35] simonstewart: What does "runhooks" do?
[17:28:43] dawagner: "Fix shit"
[17:28:49] dawagner: Regenerates useful metadata files
[17:28:55] simonstewart: In this case, the missing shit is gconf

[17:31:19] jimevans: i'm feeling distinct frustration today, but i'm sure much of it is due to a fair portion of my city being underwater (when it's not supposed to be)

[17:34:40] lukeis has joined #selenium
[17:34:42] jimevans: two swiftian modest proposals:
[17:34:46] simonstewart: Sure, if I build it
[17:34:51] simonstewart: :)
[17:35:04] barancev: you've replaced jetty with webbit, but R.java is still mentioning jetty, and android project cannot be compiled
[17:35:07] simonstewart: I take it I missed it out last time I updated android?
[17:35:27] simonstewart: soz
[17:36:08] simonstewart: Of course. I need ORBit too
[17:36:24] jimevans: first rename getAttribute() to getFrobbinschnozz(). that way, we get to fscking define what it is that we return, and don't get dinged because we *may* have overloaded a term that people *might* get confused by. 
[17:36:41] dawagner: +1 for frobbinschnozz
[17:36:48] teodosia has left #selenium
[17:37:23] Dude-X: i prefer FrobozzAttribute as an homage to Zork

[17:39:27] jimevans: feel better getting that your chest, sparky?
[17:39:35] lukeis: and welcome to monday ;)
[17:39:40] simonstewart: Yeah
[17:39:44] simonstewart: Sorry. 
[17:39:45] *lukeis is still waking up after a night of little sleep
[17:39:49] simonstewart: The foul language bear has got me today
[17:41:00] nirvdrum: jimevans: I get the tongue-in-cheek nature, but it's not a "may" and "might".  It is an overloaded term and it does confuse people.  It's unfortunate.
[17:41:28] barancev: jimevans: and the second proposal is?
[17:41:43] simonstewart: The reason I picked the method name was because I'd worked with an awful lot of web devs who didn't know the difference
[17:41:51] lukeis: i'm surprised we have users that actually know the difference of them ;)
[17:41:56] simonstewart: And I really don't like "And" or "Or" in method names
[17:42:46] nirvdrum: jquery draws the distinction, so most web devs I know can tell the difference (or at least think they can)
[17:43:06] nirvdrum: Selection bias and all that though.
[17:44:43] lukeis: the funny thing to me is the way we implemented it .getAttribute just gets the one you almost always want... and probably eliminates many confused emails because they picked the wrong one (if we had both attribute and property)
[17:45:07] nirvdrum: lukeis: That's the natural argument for it.
[17:46:06] simonstewart: I appear to be pretty deep in the rabbit hole
[17:46:12] Chuckleteeth: jimevans: where are you that is flooded?

[17:50:35] Chuckleteeth: ok well that aside, i was thinking about how one might want to do component based pages
[17:50:38] vipsoft: any ideas how I can start selenium-server-standalone and not have it output anything to the console?
[17:51:01] Chuckleteeth: at the moment i made a wrapper class around IWebElement that contains the additional elements and inits itself as a page
[17:51:44] Chuckleteeth: but the act of getting it doesn't really match up with the current page object model
[17:52:00] jimevans: okay. 
[17:52:33] Chuckleteeth: i was just wondering your opinion on that. Currently i just have a class that takes an IWebElement and also implements IWebElement and just performs it all on the wrapped iwebelement
[17:52:56] Chuckleteeth: is there already another class that does something simular to that? or is it expected ppl implement their own
[17:53:34] jimevans: there's not a .net bindings class that does anything like that, no.

[18:01:15] llaskin: might be a jarib question
[18:02:24] lukeis: most language select api's don't do that (i don't know ruby :) )

[19:18:51] AutomatedTester: its building something that I didnt want it to
[19:20:41] Donestin: having trouble getting webdriver to start on an instance of Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS, could someone help me out?
[19:21:38] AutomatedTester: Donestin: what is happening?
[19:22:07] Donestin: getting this error when I run it from Jenkins: "raise WebDriverException("Can't load the profile. Profile Dir : %s" % self.profile.path)"
[19:22:32] Donestin: and this error from in iPython:
[19:22:45] Donestin: 'Message: "Can't load the profile. Profile Dir : /tmp/tmpn3LDyx"'
[19:23:21] Chuckleteeth: is there a way to call a static method on a class without instantiating it if all you have is the Type of the class?
[19:23:22] lukeis: are you passing in a custom firefox profile or using the default?
[19:23:37] AutomatedTester: Donestin: what is the code you are using to start?
[19:24:03] Donestin: I'm pretty sure that I'm just using whatever the default is.
[19:24:17] lukeis: so, driver = webdriver.Firefox() ?
[19:24:19] Dude-X: yes Chuckleteeth
[19:24:23] Donestin: yes
[19:24:33] AutomatedTester: Donestin: does firefox launch?
[19:24:47] Donestin: just a basic open the browser and go to a URL to test that WebDriver is working
[19:25:12] Donestin: @AutomatedTester: no
[19:25:25] Chuckleteeth: how? Lets say i have SomeClass<T> and it has static methods
[19:25:34] Chuckleteeth: i only know of T as a Type 
[19:25:48] Chuckleteeth: how can i access static methods without creating an instance of SomeClass<T>
[19:26:08] AutomatedTester: Donestin: is the FIrefox installed in the normal place?
[19:26:21] Dude-X: Chuckleteeth: java?
[19:26:25] Chuckleteeth: c#
[19:26:29] Dude-X: oh beats me
[19:26:32] Chuckleteeth: : (
[19:26:41] Donestin: @AutomatedTester: checking, thanks
[19:26:43] Dude-X: in java you can do import static package.class
[19:26:43] Chuckleteeth: how would you do it in java?
[19:27:13] Dude-X: then do Class.staticFunction();
[19:27:19] Donestin: @AutomatedTester: /usr/bin/firefox
[19:27:42] lukeis: Donestin: what version of firefox? `firefox --version` and what version of selenium?
[19:27:46] Chuckleteeth: yeah but how would you do that, the class has a template/generic
[19:27:57] Chuckleteeth: it would be class<T>.statucFunction()
[19:28:00] Chuckleteeth: T is not known
[19:28:05] Chuckleteeth: you only have the Type object of T
[19:28:35] Donestin: @lukeis: FF 3.6.24
[19:29:59] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: if T is constrained, you might be able to do T.StaticMethod().
[19:30:21] jimevans: as long as StaticMethod() is a member of the constrained type.
[19:30:29] jimevans: though i've never tried it.
[19:30:50] Chuckleteeth: i fear ill have to use reflection here
[19:30:58] Chuckleteeth: jimevans you are not gonna like what ive done here
[19:30:59] jimevans: is T constrained?
[19:31:09] Chuckleteeth: T is constrained to be a class
[19:31:16] Chuckleteeth: the static method is on Class<T>
[19:31:19] Chuckleteeth: not on T itself
[19:31:20] jimevans: of what type? System.Object?
[19:31:24] jimevans: or some other type?
[19:31:30] Chuckleteeth: just of type class
[19:31:35] Chuckleteeth: not of a specific class

[19:32:07] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[19:32:10] lukeis: Donestin: and what about `python -c "import selenium; print selenium.__version__"`
[19:32:34] Chuckleteeth: im trying to make this thing smart enough that if you supplied a findsby and some other class, the class is not an iwebelement or an list of iwebelement but is a class that takes an iwebelement as a single constructor argument
[19:32:51] Chuckleteeth: one sec
[19:33:39] Donestin: @lukeis: 2.5.0
[19:33:51] Donestin: @lukeis: thanks for that command, I was grasping for it

[19:34:36] Chuckleteeth: git://gist.github.com/2990411.git
[19:34:41] Chuckleteeth: cause its not done
[19:34:55] lukeis: Chuckleteeth: it's nicer to send the http address of the gist ;)
[19:35:03] Chuckleteeth: my bad
[19:35:10] Donestin: @lukeis: right on, thanks, I ran the pip install earlier, and realize now that I forgot to sudo
[19:35:26] Chuckleteeth: https://gist.github.com/2990411
[19:36:27] Chuckleteeth: so my issue is that i cant easily create an instance of that interceptor for an unknown type because of the delegates
[19:39:37] Chuckleteeth: i could move those statics to actual constructors but then they have no name convention

[19:47:32] Donestin: @AutomatedTester: thanks, struggling though, it's not working
[19:48:05] Donestin: tried to run uninstall, but the version of pip I'm using predates that
[19:51:02] AutomatedTester: Donestin: pip install selenium --upgrade
[19:51:12] AutomatedTester: that should work well
[19:51:28] Donestin: @AutomatedTester: it wasn't for some reason,
[19:51:48] Donestin: @AutomatedTester: thinking maybe b/c the version of pip on this machine was so old, just got it to upgrade
[19:51:59] AutomatedTester: Donestin: I recommend using a virtualenv and then doing things in there
[19:52:38] AutomatedTester: and geting the latest version of that
[19:55:17] Donestin: AutomatedTester: agreed, but not gonna b/c I'm mucking around on this old box that's only used for running a very basic suite of selenium tests and it's got a lot of other detritus making it unpredictable
[19:55:56] AutomatedTester: so you are not going to make things more predictable by using a virtualenv....
[19:57:08] Donestin: AutomatedTester: that's probably true, but I'm not sure how to use virtualenv yet, the extent of my knowledge is that it's similar to Ruby's RVM
[19:57:31] AutomatedTester: Donestin: pip install virtualenv
[19:57:42] AutomatedTester: virtualenv mytests 
[19:57:44] AutomatedTester: cd mytests
[19:57:50] AutomatedTester: . bin/activate
[19:57:59] AutomatedTester: pip install selenium
[19:58:03] AutomatedTester: thats it
[19:58:22] Donestin: AutomatedTester: ok, giving it a shot, thanks

[20:05:16] Seleniumuser has joined #selenium
[20:06:00] Seleniumuser: hello room.. i am trying to get native key events to work in firefox and IE without much luck for the last few days.. is this is a know issue with Selenium 2 .. on a gird setup ? FF 13 and IE 9
[20:07:15] Seleniumuser: ??
[20:08:20] ccooper has joined #selenium
[20:08:37] klrmn: there is generally an expert on native events in IE around, but i can't recall who it is, offhand
[20:09:31] Seleniumuser:  hmm i got some help from Jim Evans a few days ago.. but he was not really sure what the problem might be... 
[20:10:44] klrmn: unfortunately, native events is just one of those things that's not quite stable…i personally have run into problems that i *think* indicates that it behaves differently with firefox on a mac depending on whether it's a FirefoxDriver or a RemoteDriver
[20:11:17] Seleniumuser: hmm i am using remote driver with firefox/IE/Chrome capabilities
[20:11:17] klrmn: i've mostly given up trying to bludgeon it into working
[20:11:43] Seleniumuser: unfortunately i see my self in the same place
[20:11:53] Seleniumuser: do you think it deems starting a ticket? 
[20:11:58] Seleniumuser: as a bug i mean
[20:12:05] Seleniumuser: cause it works great on Chrome
[20:12:14] Seleniumuser: but IE and FF drivers ... not so much
[20:12:26] klrmn: *nod*
[20:13:02] klrmn: it has been my experience that bugs languish unless then a) have a fix attached, or at least b) have tests that illustrate the problem attached
[20:13:05] Dude-X: native events on the mac is unstable, it defaults to off on the mac; you need constant window focus
[20:13:35] Seleniumuser: hmm by setup is all Win environment
[20:13:43] klrmn: Dude-X: that'd explain why it works poorly under remote and well under FirefoxDriver
[20:13:50] Seleniumuser: and yest i am making sure that the element i want to pass the keys to is selected by a click before hand
[20:14:07] Seleniumuser: yes*
[20:18:27] jimevans: Seleniumuser: native keyboard events in IE are much more reliable than mouse events.
[20:19:38] jimevans: klrmn: i've adopted a personal policy to ignore bugs that i cannot reproduce on the first try.
[20:20:19] jimevans: my time is extremely limited, and selenium work takes up far too much of it for something i'm doing just because in want to. :)
[20:21:14] klrmn: jimevans: it's a logical policy, even though it is frustrating to us on the other side
[20:21:28] Chuckleteeth: i need proper documentation on castle proxy... their page contains buttons for the documentation that do literally nothing
[20:21:58] ccooper: sounds like they need to write some selenium tests to make sure those buttons do something
[20:22:07] Chuckleteeth: yeah
[20:22:24] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: so make it easy on yourself. simply proxy IList<IWebDriver> and IEnumerable<IWebDriver> and be done with it.
[20:22:33] jimevans: s/IWebDriver/IWebElement
[20:22:39] Chuckleteeth: well i did that already
[20:22:49] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[20:22:49] Chuckleteeth: but what i really wanted was a way for nested components
[20:22:54] barancev: klrmn: seeing a bug report and not being able to repoduce it is frustrating to us, look at it from this side :)
[20:23:05] Dude-X: ccooper: that's what i said when i tried to pre-order AutomatedTester's book on selenium, the add to card button didn't work
[20:23:08] Chuckleteeth: maybe i'll do that...just stop here
[20:23:13] Chuckleteeth: since its getting really ugly
[20:23:17] Chuckleteeth: and im losing interest 
[20:23:25] jimevans: the page factory isn't going to work for nested components. it isn't designed to.
[20:23:32] Chuckleteeth: but it could!
[20:23:45] jimevans: at that point, you're far better off building your own.
[20:23:49] Chuckleteeth: i guess
[20:24:10] Chuckleteeth: i mean already you can make nested components but the act of getting a list of them requires a function 
[20:24:13] jimevans: in my opinion. people with differing opinions are welcome to prove me wrong.
[20:24:14] jimevans: :)
[20:24:30] Chuckleteeth: im just gonna gut out this crap and clean it up and thats it
[20:25:11] Chuckleteeth: one thing i dont get about their proxy generator, if you proxy an actual class...does it instantiate the class itself for the proxy?
[20:26:24] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: if you're using a composition-based proxy (which you are) http://docs.castleproject.org/Tools.Kinds-of-proxy-objects.ashx should give you some indication of types.
[20:27:03] Seleniumuser: @jimevans: how would send native events vs keyboard events..
[20:27:15] Seleniumuser: his is what i am doing for keyboard....this is what i am doing for keyboard events events
[20:27:28] Seleniumuser:  //Select the next 5 thumbnails using <shift> and clicking on them.                  Actions act_multiselect = new Actions(WebDriverSetup.driver);                 act_multiselect.KeyDown(Keys.LeftShift).Click(WebDriverSetup.driver.FindElementByXPath(ThumbnailViewerUI.first_thumbnail)).Click(WebDriverSetup.driver.FindElementByXPath(ThumbnailViewerUI.fifth_thumbnail)).KeyUp(Keys.LeftShift);                 IAction multiselect =
[20:27:34] Seleniumuser: multiselect.Perform();

[21:28:37] jillio: hi experts, can someone tell me if this is a legit setup. 1) local machine will start up selenium-nodes vm's and selenium-hub vm 2) local machine will fire the junit tests whereby Webdrivers are created pointing to selenium-hub vm. The screenshot im getting shows"This is initial start page for the WebDriver server" 
[21:28:39] jillio: OR 
[21:28:52] jillio: selenium-hub has to run on the same machine as where junit is run
[21:31:22] lukeis: doesn't have to be... just need to configure your junit test to point to the hub address
