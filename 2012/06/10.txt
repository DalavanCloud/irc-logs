[18:19:57] nirvdrum: DarkRift: All of the committers use IDEA.
[18:20:19] nirvdrum: Your best bet is to grab the community edition (free) if you don't have a paid license.
[18:21:11] DarkRift: I do have a valid license, yet I don'T find IDEA as easy to use as eclipse tho ... but I'll give it another shot ...
[18:22:18] DarkRift: thanks for the input tho

[18:34:05] nirvdrum: DarkRift: You probably could make it work with Eclipse, but none of the committers use it, so you're on your own.
[18:34:21] nirvdrum: Naturally, we don't commit Eclipse project files as a result.
