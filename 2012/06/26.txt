[01:28:37] Nogem: I find myself in an odd position, driver is finding elements but when I use getPageSource I'm getting 0kb files
[01:28:55] Dude-X_: files?
[01:29:00] Dude-X_: are you dumping them to files?
[01:29:07] Nogem: String src = driver.getPageSource();

[01:29:17] Dude-X_: page source returns a string
[01:29:38] Dude-X_: this is after a get()
[01:30:01] Nogem: this is after a get and successful WebElement assignments
[01:30:24] Dude-X_: try Logger.error(driver.getPageSource()
[01:30:32] Dude-X_: is that java or C#
[01:30:37] Nogem: java
[01:31:17] Dude-X_: well try to output to consolle
[01:31:23] Dude-X_: i've never seen getPageSource fail
[01:32:33] Nogem: running a System.out.print(src); now
[01:32:58] Nogem: ok, so there's a PrintWriter issue
[01:33:09] Nogem: the print statement works
[01:33:13] Nogem: *headdesk*
[01:33:19] Dude-X_: yeah i suspected that :D
[01:33:39] Nogem: appreciate the guidance
[01:33:49] Dude-X_: i would think you would need to pass a FIle() object somewhere into the printwriter
[01:33:54] Dude-X_: or just write to file directly

[14:26:07] kallisti: speaking of which, any recommendations for how I should handle automatic server starting/killing? Since I don't sync releases with selenium, it seems like I can't.
[14:26:23] eranm has joined #selenium
[14:26:36] eranm: barancev, now I'm actually here
[14:27:05] kallisti: I suppose I /could/ sync realeases with selenium. But can I bundle selenium software with my third-party code?
[14:28:19] kallisti: I suppose I could, since it's under the Apache license. I just couldn't bundle some of the drivers that aren't under the selenium project.
[14:28:57] guidocalvano: kallisti: is it possible to execute selenese scripts by pushing them to the web driver?
[14:29:14] guidocalvano: *sending them to the...
[14:30:41] kallisti: I'm not familiar with the RC protocol, but I believe it just executes selense.
[14:31:04] kallisti: the WebDrier wire protocol (which is the one I'm more familiar with)  doesn't use selenese at all.
[14:31:10] kallisti: *driver
[14:31:15] *kallisti briefly imagines a WebDrier
[14:31:35] *guidocalvano giggles
[14:31:52] mdgreenfield has left #selenium
[14:32:12] kallisti: guidocalvano: what's the particular reason for wanting to do so?
[14:33:00] guidocalvano: kallisti: I can't get the people I work with to use web driver immediately, so I want to know if all the test I am writing now can be incorporated into a web driver based testing script later
[14:33:34] kallisti: I believe selenium IDE can translate selenese scripts into other languages, no?
[14:33:41] guidocalvano: kallisti: the unit tests will be php
[14:34:00] *kallisti will assume there's a really good reason for that.
[14:34:15] guidocalvano: kallisti: we use cakephp
[14:34:29] kallisti: ah
[14:34:41] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[14:34:48] guidocalvano: if I had a choice we'd use django or nodejs
[14:35:00] guidocalvano: but I don't and only recently joined the company
[14:35:21] *kallisti uses yesod for his freelance web programming projects.
[14:36:31] kallisti: so, it looks to me like Selenium IDE scripts are actually just RC selense
[14:36:47] davehunt: kallisti: there are WebDriver export formats too
[14:37:03] kallisti: what kind of format?
[14:37:11] kallisti: HTTP requests?
[14:38:48] kallisti: I guess that wouldn't work.
[14:44:22] kallisti: guidocalvano: shouldn't the choice of webframework be irrelevant to the choice of language for selenium-based unit tests?
[14:44:47] kallisti: unless you communicate with the cakePHP library in some way other than through HTTP.
[14:44:54] guidocalvano: how do I select an a node based on its contents in xpath
[14:45:43] guidocalvano: I want to select an a tag at some path in my html, based on the text in the link, but I can't use a link locator, because the text in the link occurs everywhere...

[15:05:53] kallisti: I'm looking at the Java code in particular. seems to be the case there as well.
[15:06:50] Dude-X: so in python, webdriver wait passes in a driver object and expects a True or False

[15:07:23] kallisti: jimevans: in recommendations on how I should, as a third-party library, bundle selenium drivers in order to enable automatic starting/stopping of servers?
[15:07:29] kallisti: Dude-X: yeah I'm familiar with the Python implementation.
[15:07:52] kallisti: s/in/any/
[15:07:55] Dude-X: also take a look at my github to see how i implemented ExpectedConditions in a pythonic way
[15:07:58] softmanpetro: I am getting cannot connect to port 7055 after 45000 ms on a centos machine when running a test.php 
[15:08:20] kallisti: Dude-X: well I think the Haskell way to implement ExpectedConditions would be to just add more functions.
[15:08:29] kallisti: that do the things that ExpectedConditions do.
[15:08:52] Dude-X: the trick is to write code that looks like WebDriverWait(driver, timeout)until(element_is_located(locator))
[15:09:01] Dude-X: without using lambdas
[15:09:19] brokenthumbs has joined #selenium
[15:10:42] barancev: why not use lambdas?
[15:10:50] jimevans: kallisti: most third-party bindings don't even try to do browser-specific drivers, relying instead on the java remote server. if you are doing browser-specific drivers, i'd say don't bother. people can download the IE and chrome standalone servers separately. firefox is problematic there, though. you'll want to bundle the firefox extension.
[15:10:53] kallisti: because Python is bad at those
[15:11:27] kallisti: jimevans: yeah I see no reason to, at the very least, provide a "withFirefoxDriver" function
[15:11:28] Dude-X: barancev: to do less typing
[15:11:32] kallisti: *not to
[15:11:35] softmanpetro: I see in the log Firefox console output Error :L no display specified
[15:13:28] kallisti: softmanpetro: sounds like you're running on a headless configuration
[15:13:35] kallisti: you'll want to install something like X virtual frame buffer
[15:13:40] kallisti: to give you an X display
[15:13:58] kallisti: then set the DISPLAY environment variable to the X display running the virtual X server.

[15:15:54] eranm: barancev, I usually combine this flag with 'onlyrun'
[15:16:58] kallisti: I think what I'll do for expected conditions is just write some helper functions that are completely unrelated to explicit waits.
[15:17:23] kallisti: so to use it as an expected condition you just compose it with the expect function, which takes a predicate and throws an ExpectFailed exception.
[15:18:26] kallisti: wait (expect =<< alertIsPresent)

[15:30:45] Dude-X: i need advice, what's the best way to verify the presence of images on a page, do you do is_Displayed() on a element
[15:30:50] jimevans: eranm_: ping
[15:30:56] eranm_: hi
[15:30:58] Dude-X: our outsource team is checking the img_src tag
[15:31:13] Dude-X: the img src attribute i mean
[15:31:34] kallisti: Dude-X: get the tag name, see if it's an image. if you're looking for a specific image check the src attribute. catch NoSuchElementException.
[15:31:34] Dude-X: i feel is_displayed is best because, it checks that an element reports a size > 0
[15:31:47] jimevans: eranm_: what needs to be done to get native events working (Windows and/or Linux) for compound interactions (keyboard + mouse)?
[15:31:49] Dude-X: if you're looking for a  specific image… hm
[15:32:04] kallisti: Dude-X: yeah but is_displayed will be true for a lot of things that aren't images.
[15:32:18] Eleccy: out_src team? :p
[15:32:34] Dude-X: XD
[15:32:37] kallisti: checking the tag name for "img" (case insensitive) seems like a reasonable thing to do.
[15:32:56] kallisti: but again it's circumstantial what you need to check.
[15:33:11] Dude-X: well an element can be present on the page, and have the tag name img_src, but if the image is missing, it will have a zero size
[15:33:12] kallisti: that's like... every all the checks that makes sense, without having any more details.
[15:33:23] Dude-X: err the attribute src
[15:33:33] jfunk has joined #selenium
[15:33:46] kallisti: ah you want visible images.
[15:34:15] kallisti: yeah is_displayed makes sense.
[15:34:27] Dude-X: in this particular case, I think checking the src is a good secondary check (Because it may be an image of a correct choice versus the image of a wrong choice)
[15:34:34] Dude-X: alright, thanks for the feedback
[15:35:11] eranm_: jimevans, compound interactions should be working whenever native events are turned on
[15:35:36] eranm_: which is true by default on Windows, should be explicitly turned on for the FirefoxDriver on Linux (FirefoxProfile.setEnableNativeEvents...)
[15:36:11] eranm_: jimevans, but it doesn't quite work on Windows - I'm now trying to figure out why (and if it has any relation to the events not being constantly fired, which is what makes it not work for IE, AFAIK)
[15:36:34] jimevans: eranm_: that's what i was getting at. thanks for looking into it.
[15:39:23] softmanpetro: is working kallisto now ... starting to understand the process
[15:41:44] kallisti: what are these mythical compound interactions.
[15:41:59] kallisti: softmanpetro: glad to hear.
[15:42:23] jimevans: kallisti: we're talking about the advanced user interactions api. right now, things like shift+click or control+click don't work well on windows.
[15:42:33] kallisti: ahh
[15:42:56] jimevans: it's server-side code that's not working, not at the language bindings level.
[15:42:58] kallisti: isn't native events a capability setting? I'm confused by the mirroring of desired capabilities and the Firefox profile preferences.
[15:43:19] llaskin: jim: hows the storm treating you?
[15:43:53] jimevans: llaskin: i think we're passed the worst of it for us, though the winds may still bring us some storm surge related flooding.
[15:43:57] jimevans: thanks for asking.
[15:44:09] kallisti: jimevans: I imagine the serverside code is a beast to work with.
[15:44:14] *jimevans knocks on the nearest wooden surface.
[15:44:47] jimevans: kallisti: it's not so bad, actually. working with the IE driver server code is pretty easy.
[15:45:16] *kallisti has toyed with the idea of implementing his own selenium server, but realizes it'll never happen. :P
[15:45:32] jimevans: set a pause in your language binding code, attach the visual studio debugger to the IEDriverServer.exe process, and off you go. :)
[15:45:43] kallisti: I'd totally write all the javascript in Haskell, using the UHC Haskell->Javascript backend. :D
[15:45:44] *jimevans has built his own selenium server, and needs to get back to updating it.
[15:46:02] kallisti: it could even interface with the google javascript code.
[15:46:05] kallisti: pretty easily.
[15:46:05] eranm_: kallisti, just so it happens that my intern is working on unifying FIrefox profile preferences and capabilities
[15:46:14] kallisti: ah excellent.
[15:46:31] kallisti: because I don't expose any of the firefox preferences as part of the interface (other than the ability to manually set them, of course)
[15:46:35] kallisti: but I don't have specialized methods for them
[15:46:41] kallisti: I use the capabilities interface exclusively.
[15:48:02] eranm has joined #selenium
[15:48:46] *kallisti wonders if there will ever be such a thing as a JVM backend for a Haskell compiler.
[15:49:00] kallisti: seems unlikely.
[15:50:21] kallisti: GHC bakes a runtime system into every executable, containing the garbage collector, IO system, and a thread scheduler.
[15:50:31] kallisti: so you'd need to reimplement all of that in JVM bytecode.
[15:50:54] cgoldberg: sounds like a lot of turtles
[15:51:05] kallisti: turtles?
[15:51:36] cgoldberg: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down
[15:51:47] kallisti: you could use the JVM itself for most of that, probably at the expense of performance. it's all fine-tuned towards Haskell, especially the GC.
[15:53:55] kallisti: cgoldberg: ah, yes. many turtles.

[16:00:21] eranm: Zack, I'm no IDE expert, but wouldn't it be easier to use Twitter / Facebook's APIs?
[16:01:43] jimevans: eranm: i've willfully ignored the ssl cert issue with IE for the last 18 months. i don't know if it's even feasible, no.
[16:01:55] Zack: most likely, but this is just for a simple footer link test.  2 of these links happen to be facebook/twitter
[16:09:44] Zack: @eranm according to our dev team we do use Facebook's API but I don't believe the error is based on the API.  From frequent online searches it appears this error is frequent and with little to no ability to workaround
[16:18:10] andreastt: gclient and/or svn is really stupid.

[16:54:23] andreastt: Anyone got any experience with this?

[17:10:06] barancev: I'll try to repaire it
[17:11:13] RossPatterson: RC has extensions too, but far fewer of them than IDE does, and I've never heard of a flow-control RC extension.  There are several flow-control IDE extensions, including the one listed at http://seleniumhq.org/download/: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flow-control/

[17:13:18] Zack: I have an IDE extension that I use and it runs fine.  I would like to be able to use the while function in RC though.
[17:13:43] eranm_: It *is* an open-source project and whoever codes wins, but I'll appreciate it if you can hold off on changes to these areas for a few days - until she can get her changes in.
[17:14:57] barancev: eranm_: yes, I see simon already started it (with rpoxy), I was going to ask about native events - nice to hear you've already dealing with them
[17:14:59] Zack: basically I created a test suite in Selenium IDE that uses a flow-control extension that allows the use of "while".  I would like to be able to run this test in RC for cross-browser testing. 
[17:16:39] RossPatterson: Zack - are you using the "-htmlsuite" option of RC to run the tests?
[17:16:50] Zack: yes
[17:17:14] barancev: what I'm dreaming about is an ability to switch native/synth events on the fly
[17:17:15] Spanktar has joined #selenium
[17:17:35] barancev: and other "behaviour" capabilities too
[17:18:35] Zack: I don't think RC allows the usage of while unless it uses the -userExtension function in the command line but I can't seem to find an extension that works properly.  The one I use for IDE doesn't work in RC
[17:19:00] RossPatterson: Zack - that explains the confusion.  It's an odd little part of RC that doesn't fit with any other part of RC.
[17:19:42] RossPatterson: I don't think there's any way to make RC load the user extension files that IDE loads.
[17:20:14] Zack: Exactly, which is why I searched to see if there were any RC extensions and apparently there were in previous versions

[17:26:40] Dude-X:  //div[contains(@class, 'someString')]
[17:27:20] RossPatterson: Zack: You can probably re-build them in the form necessary for RC's -userextensions option, but that may be rather difficult.  The actual command-execution mechanism is similar for IDE and RC, but I'd be wary about the real meat of the problem - moving the
[17:27:28] RossPatterson: ... "next step" pointer.
[17:27:45] guidocalvano: what am I doing wrong here: xpath=//tr[contains( td, 'Hutspot') ]/td[3]

[17:28:26] Dude-X: td is an element

[19:21:51] llaskin: super easy
[19:22:07] llaskin: warning: if you plan to use the IDE, you will not be able to do this
[19:22:12] llaskin: i assume you are planning to use the WD API

[19:35:00] betabug: sphinx has a good name
[19:35:35] diminoten: Sphinx is a shotgun imo
[19:36:01] diminoten: your project needs a certain amount of complexity before Sphinx becomes worth it, at least the automatic parts
[19:36:03] betabug: bmulholland: it kind of depends on your audience I guess

[19:42:54] bmulholland: Good point… I just won't worry about it for now
[19:45:31] lukeis: python api docs are generated by sphinx ;)
[19:46:35] lukeis: restructured text (rst) is not very easy markdown to understand though, i'm not a big fan of it... even though most of sehq uses it...

[22:32:03] Dude-X: given div[title='x'] how would you handle x where x = "Don't do "that"!; that is how do escape quotes in a css selector or xpath?
[22:32:36] bmulholland has joined #selenium
[22:34:14] Dude-X: does xpath in webdriver handle xml entites properly?
[22:34:21] kennethkoontz has joined #selenium
[22:37:21] lukeis: Dude-X: in java.... "div[title='Don\\'t do \"that\"!']"
[22:38:04] ignacio_ has joined #selenium
[22:40:41] Dude-X: hmm lemme try that
[22:43:14] Dude-X: doesn't work
[22:43:33] lukeis: are the double quotes actually html entities instead if you view the source?
[22:43:54] _md has joined #selenium
[22:43:59] lukeis: &quote; or similar...
[22:45:13] barancev: :apidocs

[22:45:50] Zack: div[title='Don,"'",'t do "that!']
[22:46:07] Dude-X: is that a css selector?
[22:46:18] Zack: xpath
[22:46:26] Dude-X: you're mssing the @
[22:46:27] Dude-X: :D
[22:46:39] Dude-X: okay let me try that
[22:46:53] kallisti: looks like a valid CSS selector to me.
[22:46:55] Zack: lol I just copy and pasted lukeis 
[22:46:59] Zack: and messed with it
[22:47:17] kallisti: Dude-X: just switch to perl, which has flexible quoting syntax. :>
[22:47:25] Dude-X: it's not the language binding
[22:47:29] Dude-X: it's xpath i have to get right
[22:47:53] lukeis: Dude-X: did you view page source? how are they escaping the double quotes to get it in there as the title=" ... "
[22:48:10] Dude-X: give me a sec
[22:48:23] Zack: forgot a single quote whoops..  div[title='Don',"'",'t do "that!']
[22:48:24] dmachi has joined #selenium
[22:49:19] lukeis: i would think it better to use the strconcat (sp?) function in xpath
[22:49:37] lukeis: not that i'm recommending xpath ;)
[22:50:10] Dude-X: firefox inspector shows no escaping what's so ever
[22:50:24] Dude-X: i guess i'll have to do that then
[22:50:31] lukeis: inspectors don't help in this case, you actually have to view page source 
[22:50:42] Dude-X: page source doesn't help eiher since ajax creates the list of titles
[22:51:18] lukeis: ok... is it innerHTML = ... inserting or creating dom elements and assigning title?
[22:51:43] Dude-X: yeah, it polls the database and returns a list of up to 50 items
[22:52:00] lukeis: didn't answer my question ;)
[22:52:44] Dude-X: not sute what you mean by innerHTML
[22:53:10] lukeis: you'll have to know how the javascript actually inserts the data into the page
[22:53:17] Dude-X: oh that i don't know
[22:53:36] Dude-X: it's full of jquerty
[22:53:47] lukeis: because that "  could actually be &quot; or %22
[22:54:26] lukeis: or something similar that the browser (and inspectors) are translating for you ... but your selector has to match the original
[22:54:50] barancev: why driver.manage().window().getSize() returns the size of a frame (if you are in a frame) instead of the window?
[22:55:21] lukeis: because no one took care of looking at the top context? :)
[22:57:12] Dude-X: i see the code that sets the title
[22:57:23] barancev: what I want to understand -- whether it is intended behaviour or not?
[22:58:10] lukeis: barancev: i would think window.top.size to be expected... just like getTitle always returns window.top.title
[22:58:44] lukeis: window is supposed to be independent from frame... so i thought

[23:02:06] barancev: omg, sorry, window().getSize returns the size of the window, all right

[23:09:35] Dude-X: i never liked using text() in my xpath
[23:10:00] jarib: Ardesco: AFAIK using findElement() to find text nodes has never worked
[23:10:23] Dude-X: it works sometimes...
[23:10:39] Dude-X: actually hmm
[23:10:51] Dude-X: i always remove it when i find it :P
[23:10:58] Ardesco: I thought I had use it in the past, but now i'm doubting myself
[23:11:05] Ardesco: *used
[23:11:15] Ardesco: and I agree it's something to avoid if possible
[23:12:16] Dude-X: anyway use getText() on the element
[23:13:11] jarib: either improve the markup or just do getText().split("\n") on the span
[23:14:33] barancev: should wdSession.prototype.getWindow return the top window?
[23:14:34] Ardesco: feel free to close it
[23:14:49] Ardesco: and slap a muppet stamp on me
[23:14:50] Ardesco: :)
[23:15:12] Dude-X: well no, the text() issue shold be settled someway
[23:15:19] Dude-X: cause it works sometimes
[23:16:06] jarib: Dude-X: example?
