[11:29:46] AutomatedTester: still havent got an Opera sign up?

[11:31:47] *AutomatedTester is trying to hunt down where marionette is crashing in the browser and taking the socket with it
[11:32:04] AutomatedTester: but when I following the logging down to what I think it is, it moves
[11:32:24] andreastt: Heisenbug?
[11:32:29] andreastt: Those are fun.
[11:32:42] andreastt: Or the opposite.  Depending.
[11:32:51] andreastt: Or, who knows? (-;
[11:33:07] AutomatedTester: the bug is when I close a window (like from a link) the command that closes it never returns
[11:33:13] AutomatedTester: and we get a timeout on the client side
[11:33:26] andreastt: Sounds awefully like something tied to a window runtime.
[11:33:46] AutomatedTester: yup
[11:33:51] AutomatedTester: which is "fun"
[11:35:17] AutomatedTester: at least I have a failing test to help me find it
[11:36:40] dawagner: I love that thing where you suggest an answer to someone's problem, and someone else chimes in "No, absolutely don't do that" without giving a better answer
[11:37:09] AutomatedTester: dawagner: sounds like an average day in a developers life

[15:37:30] bsilverberg: andreastt: When I run tests on my Mac, each time OperaDriver starts Opera I get the "Do you want the application "opera" to accept incoming network connections?" dialog. It doesn't happen if I open Opera myself. Any idea of how I can stop that from happening?
[15:38:05] andreastt: Sounds like the firewall on OS X.
[15:38:32] andreastt: We start Opera with a different set of command-line arguments every time, maybe that's what triggers it.
[15:38:46] bsilverberg: Yes, but I cannot figure out how to tell it not to do that. It already has a rule for Opera, but that rule doesn't seem to apply when the driver starts Opera
[15:39:08] dawagner: bsilverberg: If you ignore it, things should still Just Work
[15:39:20] andreastt: It happens when I do Python development using Pyramid on OS X too.
[15:39:27] andreastt: Wasn't able to figure it out, so I disabled my firewall. d-:
[15:39:29] bsilverberg: I have found that sometimes tests fail from timeouts, but maybe that's something else
[15:39:36] bsilverberg: Still, it's annoying ;-)
[15:40:15] andreastt: Timeouts?  Can you give me more context?
[15:40:15] bsilverberg: I suppose disabling the firewall when running tests would be a quick fix
[15:40:53] bsilverberg: I'll try another test run and see if I get a failure, and if so provide the details. It seems intermittent

[15:41:08] andreastt: Thanks
[15:43:08] bsilverberg: Is there a switch to run do test_javascript but tell it to run on Opera only?
[15:43:18] bsilverberg: go test_javascript
[15:43:39] dawagner: There are a couple of things you can do
[15:43:52] dawagner: test_javascript actually expands to three targets:
[15:44:38] dawagner: Four, even: //javascript/atoms:test:run, //javascript/webdriver:test:run, //javascript/selenium-atoms:test:run, //javascript/selenium-core:test:run
[15:44:49] dawagner: Taking the first as an example, it actually expands to:
[15:45:11] dawagner: /javascript/atoms:test_ff:run //javascript/atoms:test_opera:run and so on, depending on exactly which browsers are detected on your system
[15:45:17] dawagner: So you can run:
[15:45:43] dawagner: ./go //javascript/atoms:test_opera:run //javascript/webdriver:test_opera:run //javascript/selenium-atoms:test_opera:run //javascript/selenium-core:test_opera:run
[15:47:09] dawagner: Or you can edit rake-tasks/browsers.rb to remove the browsers which aren't opera
[15:47:24] dawagner: And just run ./go test_javascript
[15:48:08] bsilverberg: Nice, thanks dawagner

[15:51:58] andreastt: bsilverberg: 0.14?
[15:52:25] andreastt: It says 2.22.0, so I assume so.
[15:52:58] andreastt: Is it consistent on enter_submit_test.html?
[15:53:23] bsilverberg: No, I just added another file to the gist which shows a failure on a different test
[15:53:44] andreastt: Does it hang there for like 60 seconds before failing?
[15:53:55] bsilverberg: 0.14 of what? The driver? How do I check the version of that?
[15:54:07] bsilverberg: Yes, it does
[15:55:05] andreastt: It usually happens when a page takes too long to load.
[15:55:24] andreastt: But seeing as these tests are local, I'm guessing we're missing some response from the browser.
[15:55:35] andreastt: I'll have a look at ClosureTestSuite.
[15:56:36] dawagner: andreastt: The way ClosureTestSuite works is it document.write's a bunch of script tags; that's probably the same bug I reported to you a while ago :)
[15:56:57] andreastt: That makes sense.
[15:57:08] andreastt: bsilverberg: Can you try run that against Opera 12?
[15:57:16] andreastt: bsilverberg: It has ecmascript service, which enables JIT.
[15:57:18] bsilverberg: Funny you should ask
[15:57:29] bsilverberg: Opera just updated itself to 12
[15:57:45] bsilverberg: my first run completed fine. I'm going to try a few more
[15:57:46] andreastt: Uhm yeah.  We're forcing it on you.

[20:46:15] jachin: I have a question. I'm using python and unit test. I want to run the same tests across multiple sites (development site, testing site, live site, etc). I'm thinking I should create a subclass of unittest.TestCase that will load up values from a config file like domain name, credentials, test data, etc (I'm not sure how I would specify different config files yet). I could write this, but I'm wondering if anyone out there has already. (I'm not married
[20:46:15] jachin: my solution, if there's something out there that gets me to where I need to be another way thats cool too). Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks
[20:51:05] Dude-X: jachin: that's pretty much what we do, where have a config file (property file) that loads different values based on the environment
[20:51:44] jachin: How are you specifying the config file? Is it a command line option?
[20:52:53] Dude-X: it's a java project so ant loads the properties file
[20:53:12] Dude-X: but in the actual webdriver test, we have a thing that reads the property and check for an "environmnet" prefix first
[20:53:38] Dude-X: we have keys in this manner browser, browser.timeout, browser.download.directory
[20:53:57] Dude-X: an environment prefix mightl ook like staging.browser

[21:01:49] klrmn: exactly
[21:02:47] klrmn: granted, if you've already got a bunch of tests, retrofitting them might be crazy-making‚Ä¶but i've never done selenium tests in python any other way
[21:03:46] jachin: Thanks a lot, that does look useful. I'll look into it. Yeah I'm a little worried about that‚Ä¶ I haven't used py.test yet‚Ä¶ but I'll look into it.
[21:04:14] Dude-X: yeah use py.test it's pretty neat
[21:05:07] jachin: (Dude-X, thanks for responding‚Ä¶ I'll keep that in mind if I ever need to write up tests in java)
[21:06:29] Dude-X: for webdriver i would totally recommend sticking with python, but if you have to use Java, i'd recommend testNG since it has more built in than jUnit
[21:06:35] Dude-X: my project uses Junit
[21:07:54] tessarakt: it all depends on the infrastructure you have, right?
[21:08:07] tessarakt: it has to integrate with the other tools you are using ...
[21:08:32] tessarakt: if and when they give Python a normal (i.e., C-like) syntax, I might consider using it
[21:09:05] Dude-X: in order to use python effectively you have to embrace it's idioms
[21:09:26] Dude-X: using it like C (say avoiding exceptions) would make it slow and harder to read
[21:09:52] Dude-X: besides I find python pretty C in like in some of its conventions
