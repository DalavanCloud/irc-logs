[00:00:26] jimevans: jarib: so you'll be happy to know that contrary to appearances, multiple instances of the standalone server won't attempt to bind to the same port.
[00:00:38] stackedsax: hey there — anybody written any alternatives to davehunt's flynnid?
[00:00:43] lukeis: :log
[00:00:43] selbot2: http://illicitonion.com/selogs/selenium/2012/05/02.txt
[00:00:46] jimevans: or actually will attempt to, but it won't succeed.
[00:00:51] lukeis: now it's d'oh

[00:01:33] lukeis: is london GMT right now?
[00:01:42] dawagner: London is BST right now :)
[00:01:48] dawagner: GMT+1
[00:01:59] lukeis: hrm
[00:02:08] lukeis: then it should have shifted an hour ago
[00:02:42] jarib: jimevans: ok?
[00:02:52] lukeis: or i have my maths completely backwards :-D
[00:03:06] jimevans: jarib: that was one of your concerns yesterday.
[00:03:12] lukeis: everyone be glad i don't normally work on timezone code
[00:03:29] stackedsax: there's this little utility we've been using https://github.com/davehunt/flynnid
[00:03:45] stackedsax: for which I thank davehunt
[00:03:47] jarib: jimevans: indeed. i can launch the server twice with the same --port argument. what's going on?
[00:04:29] stackedsax: but doing anything with python in my org is just a drag — wondered if anybody had implemented the same in perl
[00:04:31] lukeis: davehunt: modified my extremely simple python script for that ;) ... so my alternative is another python script ;)
[00:04:43] stackedsax: heh, dangit
[00:05:07] jarib: lukeis: my VPS is oslo time, UTC+2
[00:05:16] stackedsax: I'll have to write something up in perl or bash...
[00:05:41] lukeis: jarib: but the call i made in ruby i thought would get GMT no matter what... /me officially confused
[00:06:05] jarib: jimevans: it also reports 5555 when it's launched twice without a --port argument
[00:07:32] jarib: jimevans: actually seems like i'm able to launch it as many times as i want, and never get a bind error
[00:07:47] lukeis: ok... BST+1 = GMT  so right now is 2300... ok, in one hour it'll switch... i feel better now
[00:08:41] lukeis: GMT+1 = BST... whatever... i give up on today
[00:10:12] lukeis: 'night all
[00:10:18] jarib: jimevans: interstingly, chromedriver does the same on Windows (Win7)
[00:11:07] jarib: on OS X, chromedriver silently quits (with exit code 0) if you try to launch a second server on the same port
[00:12:22] jimevans: jarib: you're right, you don't get a bind error, but that's because I'm an idiot.
[00:12:34] jimevans: internally, it does the right thing, but it just doesn't terminate itself.
[00:13:04] jimevans: again, more correctly, the server does encounter a bind error, it just silently swallows it. :)
[00:13:33] jimevans: i'm working on correcting that oversight.
[00:13:42] jimevans: (and implementing the --host arg)
[00:13:47] jarib: it's interesting that chromedriver does the same
[00:14:23] jimevans: i think it's just laziness. actually, i'm sure it's laziness on my part.

[00:28:06] dgtlmoon has joined #selenium
[00:33:10] jimevans: jarib: where does mongoose allow binding to a specific NIC?
[00:34:12] jimevans: i mean, i can set the acl to only allow connections from a specific IP address, but i'm not sure that's what you're looking for.
[00:35:04] dawagner: jimevans: By the way, I would suggest we by default bind to 0.0.0.0 not 127.0.0.1 because we *will* get people complaining
[00:35:36] jarib: jimevans: the listening_ports option can be "127.0.0.1:5555"
[00:35:38] jimevans: doesn't matter to me, as long as it works.
[00:35:42] jarib: https://github.com/krosenvold/selenium-git-release-candidate/blob/master/third_party/mongoose/mongoose.c#L3416
[00:35:55] jarib: i think it already does 0.0.0.0 by default
[00:36:00] jimevans: ah. that's the piece i'd forgotten from yesterday's conversations.
[00:36:45] jarib: i'm trying to figure out how this stuff can possibly work
[00:37:21] jarib: it doesn't seem to be a problem for java
[00:37:40] AutomatedTester: jezuz: clickAndWait waits for the page to return that it has loaded
[00:37:46] AutomatedTester: its not for javascript
[00:39:42] AutomatedTester: night guys
[00:41:10] jimevans: jarib: which stuff would that be?
[00:42:51] jarib: at least on OS X, "localhost" will resolve to 3 different interfaces
[00:43:08] Dude-X: oh gosh, a webdriver test that's poorly written. I just ran a test and it passed except the condition is testing is not working properly. :/ 
[00:43:29] jimevans: ah. i see.
[00:44:29] Dude-X: turns out the only reason i am lookng at it is because it's failing on our nightly full test suite (due to flakiness i presume)
[00:44:56] jarib: jimevans: yeah, our find_free_port code would need to know what interface to check, unless it also controls what interface the servers are binding to
[00:46:12] jarib: chances of this actually happening is pretty low, but unless there's something i'm missing it is a relatively significant flaw in our code..
[00:47:05] Dude-X: last thursday when i ran selenium-standalone it grabbed the ip from vmnet adapter :/
[00:47:11] Dude-X: instead of ethernet
[00:47:11] jarib: on Win 7, two interfaces
[00:47:59] jarib: linux, two
[00:49:24] jarib: safest bet is probably to just use 0.0.0.0 for everything
[00:49:48] Dude-X: does isEnabled check if class contains disabled?
[00:50:05] dawagner: No, why would it?
[00:50:13] Dude-X: what does it do actually?
[00:50:40] dawagner: Check the disabled property
[00:51:03] Dude-X: what's a property?
[00:51:09] Dude-X: ah in the javascript sense
[00:51:12] jarib: but then again, i think firefox binds to 127.0.0.1, so if you're checking 0.0.0.0 for free ports, you may pick one already in use...
[00:51:37] jarib: what a depressing realization.
[00:53:34] dawagner: jarib: Yes, the firefoxdriver bind to 127.0.0.1
[00:53:58] dawagner: But also is a very different mechanism
[00:54:13] eanxgeek: not directly related to selenium, but anyone here help with pytest?  https://gist.github.com/2581987
[00:54:29] eanxgeek: scenario1 works, scenario2 does not; TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing
[00:54:58] eanxgeek: I'm thinking I need to change something in pytest_generate_tests() however, not sure what / where to ensure compatability with dict
[00:55:21] jarib: dawagner: still a problem if you're launching multiple instances of Firefox and probing 0.0.0.0 for free ports. you may find one that's free on 0.0.0.0, but not on 127.0.0.1
[00:55:57] Dude-X: eanxgeek: {'read','write'} is a set in python 2.7
[00:56:33] Dude-X: maybe it should be parans or a bracket 
[00:56:43] eanxgeek: Dude-X: sorry yes a set, I'm trying to leverage a set for certain keys so that I can do for i in verb: select(i)
[00:56:49] jarib: dawagner: it's not a problem in Firefox' case, since PortProber actually checks 127.0.0.1
[00:57:05] eanxgeek: that's my end goal, but I'm trying to use data driven tests for the first time so this is a learning expierment 
[00:57:13] jarib: dawagner: but the mongoose based servers listens on 0.0.0.0, and now you have the opposite problem
[00:57:20] eanxgeek: Dude-X: let me play with those two
[00:57:27] Dude-X: eanxgeek: can you use a tuple instead? same benefits as a set unless you want to do set operations
[00:57:40] jarib: dawagner: you see the issue?
[00:57:47] Dude-X: but if you explicitly want to do est operations, then just do set(thing)
[00:57:56] dawagner: jarib: Unfortunately so :(
[00:57:58] eanxgeek: Dude-X: that looks to have worked, both tests passed
[00:58:04] Dude-X: :)
[00:58:06] eanxgeek: 'verb': ['read','write']})
[00:58:17] eanxgeek: that's awesome
[00:58:28] eanxgeek: Dude-X: thanks!

[00:59:53] jarib: i guess the simplest solution is to find a port that's free on all interfaces.

[01:24:51] selbot2: ok!
[01:25:31] eanxgeek: Dude-X: ok so I have a interesting issue, if my verbs tuple has one item in it, i.e. 'verbs': ('manage_all') I get Cannot locate option with value: m' if I have multiple items in the tuple it works perfect.
[01:25:54] eanxgeek: Dude-X: the for code, for v in verbs:
[01:25:56] eanxgeek:             home_page.select('verbs', v)
[01:26:32] eanxgeek: home_page.select is just a call to a method I wrote that takes two args, id and value
[01:27:44] brettporter has joined #selenium
[01:28:18] eanxgeek: Dude-X: fixed, had to add a comma at the end of my list, i.e. verbs: ('manage_all',)

[04:53:41] snuff-work: anyone have issue with using GRID in 2.21 and selecting IE ?
[04:54:54] snuff-work: i have a webdriver client that has IE.. yet i get msgs back from hub when i try to instanciate syaying 'new session cannot find { platform:WINDOWS, browserName=internet explorer}'
[04:58:31] Dude-X_: start the node with -browser {browserName=InternetExplorer;platform=WINDOWS} or something like that
[04:58:36] Dude-X_: that's what i do
[04:58:45] Dude-X_: but yeah it should be smart enough to do this....
[04:59:30] snuff-work: do u then need to specify something special in ur remote webdriver call.. or does it just 'start working'
[04:59:58] snuff-work: the worst thing is.. it lists in the startup of the webdriver node that it has ie..
[IRC logfile - Started Thu May  3 05:00:31 2012]
[05:00:31] snuff-work: the hub when u look at a node says.. yer he has IE
[05:01:19] snuff-work: if i dont use a hub and start sel standalone normally.. my IE call works fine
[05:03:00] Dude-X_: you have to specify for the node IE and windows then it works fine
[05:03:23] Dude-X_: though i didn't write the code for my remote webdriver startup
[05:05:09] Dude-X_: it works though, when i set the property to use internet explorer and remote; it also seems to pass in a generic DesiredCapabalities regardless of the browser i select
[05:07:15] snuff-work: mm just seems 'broken'
[05:09:54] snuff-work: when i was using just the 'server' part.. i had issues with some IE never closing after tests finished
[05:10:16] snuff-work: so it would pile up ie windows.. until it got to like 28 or so and 100% java usage
[05:10:42] Dude-X_: well 2.22 will fix some termination issues
[05:11:27] Dude-X_: -browser “browserName=internet explorer,platform=WINDOWS” <-- this is what you can start on the node that's on the windows box
[05:12:58] snuff-work: that works..
[05:13:20] snuff-work: maybe it was caring about the version.. ( i dont specify)
[05:13:38] Dude-X_: just match what the error says
[05:15:17] snuff-work: mm.. so the 'ONLY' thing i can see that might be wrong for a startup by default is this..
[05:15:55] snuff-work: {seleniumProtocol:Webdriver,browserName=internet explorer,maxInstances:1}
[05:16:09] snuff-work: aka it does not mention windows as a platform
[05:17:29] Dude-X_: it shouldn't have too but that's what it wants ...
[05:18:47] snuff-work: so when i call for IE.. i never specify platform windows.. but i'd say the 'DesiredCapabilities.internetExplorer() adds it

[14:45:38] simonstewart: krosenvold: ping
[14:46:12] jimevans: simonstewart: hi! how's the city of the broad shoulders?
[14:46:14] andreastt: simonstewart: Nothing is better, seeing as I can't reproduce it here (-:
[14:46:29] Andrei_Khveras: AutomatedTester: Thank you for interest, problem was workarounded. The matter is that JavaScript event doesn't affect elements on page until ANY native event called by Actions.
[14:46:41] simonstewart: jimevans: it turns out that the conference is situated in the 'burbs
[14:46:47] andreastt: simonstewart: So there are ready-transformed Google protobuf-compatible .proto files in /protos, the files in /protos/scope are Scope protos.
[14:46:50] simonstewart: So close to ChiTown and yet so far
[14:46:55] simonstewart: Yes there are
[14:46:57] jimevans: indeed.
[14:47:20] simonstewart: The problem boiled down to the fact that you're mixing proto1 and proto2 formats. 
[14:47:24] andreastt: (It was initially the other way around, but I found it messy.)
[14:47:27] simonstewart: Seriously, I can send a patch
[14:47:30] andreastt: Aha.
[14:47:47] simonstewart: Greg Dennis spent some time looking into the problem and came up with a fix
[14:47:54] andreastt: It's entirely possible that that might be fixed in Opera core.  I haven't updated the proto files for quite a while.
[14:48:06] andreastt: <3 Greg Dennis
[14:48:10] andreastt: In a purely platonic way, of course.

[15:00:30] simonstewart: Do that a few times, and it's pretty easy to get the commit bit :)
[15:02:21] Andrei_Khveras: Simon, I find LOTS of bugs overy day, I am forced to workaround them every time, made browser-type specific forks. But I don't feel myself experienced enough to fix WebDriver code itself. And my workarounds can't became a part of WebDriver, unfortunately.
[15:05:25] barancev: I told to Andrei in private, sould like his problems are caused by outdated selenium version in sauce environment

[15:14:10] jarib: jimevans: i landed the standalone IE server for ruby yesterday
[15:14:41] jarib: jimevans: re the bind() thing, i'm not sure just exiting the server (like chromedriver does) is a good solution
[15:15:42] jarib: basically it's saying "someone are already listening to this port, i assume it's another chromedriver server"
[15:16:01] jarib: which may be the case, but the code that's starting the server has no control over the running instance
[15:16:02] jimevans: no, you're right about that.
[15:16:35] jimevans: i'm working on a patch that will properly exit with a status code that you can check for, as well as log to the console.
[15:16:43] jarib: sounds good

[15:26:48] jimevans: i was actually kidding, but thanks.
[15:27:14] jarib: simonstewart: it'll lead to subtle bugs; e.g. when starting a server that by default binds to 0.0.0.0 (like the mongoose servers), the PortProber only checks 127.0.0.1

[18:43:27] perrick: Could it be stale?

[20:26:12] jimevans: i've been looking at your code.
[20:26:39] jimevans: i'm not sure i like the idea of using the LoadableComponentException for control flow.
[20:27:30] ksummerlin: Right. I wasn't 100% happy with it either. And actually in later versions I tried changing it to WebDriverException
[20:27:38] ksummerlin: in the catch
[20:27:57] jimevans: no, i mean, i don't like the idea of using any exception for flow control.
[20:28:10] jimevans: i know the java implementation does it, but i don't agree with it.
[20:28:13] ksummerlin: Right. Me either
[20:28:38] jimevans: so what if we turned IsLoaded into a boolean property instead? what does that do?
[20:29:52] ksummerlin: In most cases I think it means implementations of IsLoaded() will have to catch the ElementNotFoundException a lot, or use FindElements() instead.

[20:33:34] ksummerlin: That looks good to me, certainly reads better than the Java version IMHO

[20:34:08] jimevans: i need to think on that a minute.

[20:34:55] ksummerlin: right

[20:35:12] jarib: for people to customize the exception

[20:37:09] jarib: i'd probably do #throw_unable_to_load or something if i was to do that again, so people could customize the exception type as well as the message
[20:42:35] ksummerlin: jarib: I'll note that in the future I should take a look at the other language ports not just the Java version. That's a good thought.
[20:47:02] jimevans: so it seems to me the biggest concern is that the check to see if the component is loaded might involve an exception, and i agree it's probably not the best use experience to make users catch the exceptions in their implementation of IsLoaded.
[20:50:24] ksummerlin: I agree. I like returning boolean from IsLoaded, but I don't like the idea of the exceptions just falling through if someone forgets to catch WebDriverException inside the IsLoaded property.
[20:50:31] jimevans: right.
[20:50:51] jimevans: i think i'm onto something. let me play with it. new gist forthcoming.

[20:51:02] jimevans: i hate the method names that i'm coming up with, but we can change those.
[20:53:11] Dude-X: is there a javascript way of doing element.getAttribute()?
[20:53:24] Dude-X: i have a particular flaky function
[20:57:34] jimevans: alright. recheck the gist https://gist.github.com/2588496
[20:58:26] jimevans: so inheritors must implement ExecuteLoad() to actually load the component, and ChangeMyNameToSomethingMeaningful() to check whether the component is loaded.
[20:58:36] simonstewart has joined #selenium
[20:58:56] jimevans: We'd also provide HandleLoadError() to give them the opportunity to handle the exception received upon load.

[21:00:35] ksummerlin: OK, so it separates the exceptions during the IsLoaded check and the actual execution of Load().
[21:00:56] jimevans: yeah, i think that's a little better.
[21:01:34] jimevans: since the standard "does this element exist" check relies heavily on catching an exception,

[21:35:17] lukeis: Dude-X: heh ;) it's element.getAttribute('style')
[21:35:56] Dude-X: lukeis:  i want to do an executeScript, something is really for this test;
[21:36:00] Dude-X: don't know
[21:36:21] Dude-X: don't know why it's so flaky for this particular instnace
[21:36:40] lukeis: execute_script("return arguments[0].getAttribute('style')", element)
[21:37:53] lukeis: you do however in javascript have the ability to access the style properties (what is currently set on the element because css can override style)  with element.style.(stylename)
[21:39:01] lukeis: but that's the same as element.value_of_css_property('stylename')

[23:30:25] stackedsax: this is with -no-window, btw
[23:31:48] AutomatedTester: AndroidDriver needs to have 4.0. You will get some really weird and wonderful things happening without it

[23:32:31] stackedsax: I was suggesting we update the docs to actually say that

[23:32:54] AutomatedTester: stackedsax: if you have a patch then I will apply it
