[00:16:43] jimevans: jleyba: yt?
[00:17:44] jleyba: jimevans: yes
[00:18:25] jimevans: hey, i know it's not the end-all, be-all of your world to make the safari driver perfect, but have you tried getting the typing tests from the java test suite to pass?
[00:18:32] jimevans: i'm guessing not yet.
[00:18:47] jleyba: No.  I've been stuck on a bug with iframes that cause the driver to hang
[00:19:18] jleyba: From what I remember the last time I ran the entire test suit, the next big ticket item is typing
[00:19:37] jimevans: groovy. i just wondered if those tests had crossed your radar yet. sounds like they have.
[00:20:03] jleyba: Is it still the issue with things like the home and end keys?
[00:20:31] jimevans: well, i still have issues with those, yes, but i pretty much put it aside for the moment.
[00:20:35] jimevans: had other things to take care of.
[00:20:58] jimevans: it's slightly more complicated than just getting home/end, and page up/down to work
[00:21:20] jimevans: there are going to be challenges with extending selection with the keyboard. 
[00:21:28] jimevans: consider shift + left-arrow.
[00:21:43] jimevans: (just as an example)
[00:22:13] jleyba: Yeah....that's going to be fun
[00:22:15] jimevans: its behavior depends on whether the current cursor position is at the beginning or end of the selection.
[00:22:36] jimevans: i spent a little time thinking about it, but didn't have more than a little to spend.
[00:22:55] jimevans: when you get 'round to it, i'll be happy to collaborate, or at least look over your code, if you like.

[08:19:11] foolx: Hi guys! Anyone good at finding "names" for stuff? I am creating a Test System here with selenium2. Since help of some people here, its already working fine. Now my boss told me, we need a Name for the System. I already have a good idea, but i need ideas for the meaning of the single letters. 
[08:20:25] ElxRoman has joined #selenium
[08:20:45] foolx: System Name should be "VERITAS". The TAS would be for "Test Automation System", so just VERI is still missing. V could be vor Visual, since we want to create a product for our co-worker to look at in the browser to see the state of their system.

[12:21:15] pete_otaqui: Hi
[12:21:38] pete_otaqui: I'm having some trouble compiling iWebDriver in XCode 4.3 (with iOS 5.1)
[12:23:43] pete_otaqui: I'm getting errors with HTTPVirtualDirectory+FindElement.mm (Cannot initialize a parameter of type 'const char *const *' with an Ivalue of type 'const char *const'
[12:25:09] jimevans: pete_otaqui: what part of the world are you in?
[12:25:17] pete_otaqui: uk
[12:25:55] jimevans: the person who would know most about the iPhone driver is on the west coast of the US, and usually shows up around 9AM in that time zone.
[12:26:48] pete_otaqui: ah ok, will definitely try later in the day, thanks jimevans ... what nick should I look out for?
[12:26:58] jimevans: lukeis.
[12:28:07] AutomatedTester: lukeis awesome!
[12:28:16] *AutomatedTester gets a kick out of that every time
[12:29:36] moo-_- has joined #selenium

[12:31:40] AutomatedTester: see... fun for everyone
[12:31:50] AutomatedTester: pete_otaqui: tbh he might be awake atm 
[12:32:01] jimevans: true that. he's got little ones.
[12:32:12] pete_otaqui: lol, I feel his pain
[12:32:30] AutomatedTester: pete_otaqui: a lot of the team can empathize 
[12:32:40] AutomatedTester: we are a good bunch of breeders
[12:32:41] jimevans: my little ones aren't so little anymore.
[12:33:12] jimevans: the oldest one can now, in the most literal sense, fill my shoes. :)
[12:33:28] AutomatedTester: jimevans: sounds like he is old enough to work...
[12:33:51] jimevans: the oldest one i'd trust to, but he's a life-sciences geek.
[12:33:55] pete_otaqui: my shoes regularly get filled by mine.  only it's with mud / stones / paint / small spiky toys
[12:34:20] jimevans: the younger hasâ€¦ focus challenges.
[12:35:01] AutomatedTester: jimevans: he probably isnt being stretched enough...
[12:35:34] jimevans: no, i'm pretty sure that's not the case.
[12:35:45] jimevans: remember, i keep a mental health professional on staff at all times. :)
[12:35:54] AutomatedTester: jimevans: just beware of labelling
[12:36:15] jimevans: oh, i'm hyperaware.
[12:36:19] AutomatedTester: i know but I also know some professionals like to label and its hard to get rid of that label
[12:36:37] AutomatedTester: that was a broadstroke, not a slight on your Wife
[12:36:52] jimevans: i didn't take it as such. :) no worries, mate.
[12:37:12] *AutomatedTester had someone on his team that claimed ADHD
[12:37:16] pete_otaqui: since we're o/t anyway .... http://www.thersa.org/events/video/animate/rsa-animate-changing-paradigms
[12:37:46] AutomatedTester: but I think he was just being lazy because when I gave him projects in small chunks he still failed
[12:37:53] AutomatedTester: and noticed a pattern
[12:38:00] AutomatedTester: tell him off he says its his ADHD
[12:38:05] pete_otaqui: very interesting set of thoughts (with amazing animation) about changing paradigms in education, with a particular look at issues of "focus"
[12:38:09] AutomatedTester: lose, lose situation

[12:40:53] *AutomatedTester thinks anything to make maths fun is great
[12:40:55] Dude-X_: pete_otaqui, i worked for a project that used mangahigh.com has a resource
[12:41:04] Dude-X_:  /has/as
[12:41:04] AutomatedTester: especially for girls
[12:41:19] pete_otaqui: if you just want to play some quick games: http://www.mangahigh.com/en_gb/games
[12:41:29] *Dude-X_ is not used to british maths spelling
[12:41:47] AutomatedTester: Dude-X_: you mean to say you are not used to the correct maths spelling
[12:41:49] AutomatedTester: :P
[12:41:54] Dude-X_: yeah that :P
[12:42:20] AutomatedTester: There is no American English, just the queen's english and mistakes
[12:42:25] AutomatedTester: :P
[12:42:33] Dude-X_: AutomatedTester, I remember in grade school some of my teacher's would correct the kids saying maths
[12:42:47] jimevans: much respect to her majesty.
[12:42:55] pete_otaqui: Dude-X_ : http://www.mangahigh.com/?localeset=en_us
[12:42:59] Dude-X_: little they did know that they were right to say it but wrong country
[12:43:17] pete_otaqui: happy now?
[12:43:40] Dude-X_: pete_otaqui, interestingly enough your gb link took me to the US site
[12:44:09] pete_otaqui: Yes, we do geoip for that.  But the magic setting lets you get out of a given locale
[12:44:28] Dude-X_: that's good
[12:45:17] pete_otaqui: Dude-X_: can I ask what the project was that used mangahigh?
[12:45:52] Dude-X_: pete_otaqui, School of One
[12:46:05] pete_otaqui: Oh yeah, I remember
[12:46:30] Dude-X_: that project had no tests at all :/
[12:46:42] AutomatedTester: pete_otaqui: when are you dropping flash?
[12:46:52] pete_otaqui: AutomatedTester: as we speak
[12:46:53] Dude-X_: but it was pure python so it was easy to deal with, but stillâ€¦.
[12:47:05] AutomatedTester: pete_otaqui: awesome!
[12:47:25] *AutomatedTester sends a tweet about mangahigh
[12:48:12] pete_otaqui: AutomatedTester: in fact, we already rebuilt "Prodigi" (the maths quiz bit) in html & js for Brazil ... and we're working on the english version now.  The problem is that al the content was authored in flash with FREAKY WEIRD NOT REALLY HTML markup, so requires a lot more work
[12:49:02] AutomatedTester: pete_otaqui: I bet
[12:49:21] AutomatedTester: right, I really need to finish this patch 
[12:49:53] AutomatedTester: btw switch from Mac keyboard to ubuntu/windows layout is painful
[12:51:09] pete_otaqui: markup sample ... http://pastebin.com/VNaSX5eF
[12:51:38] AutomatedTester: wow... the original author hated you
[12:51:45] jarib: a former colleague of mine made a math app: http://dragonboxapp.com/
[12:52:32] AutomatedTester: jarib: thats awesome
[12:52:54] Dude-X_: pete_otaqui, these games are pretty cool
[12:53:02] *AutomatedTester honestly starts feeling the world isnt up the shitter when I see things like this
[12:53:18] pete_otaqui: jarib: that's getting sent round the office :)
[12:53:46] pete_otaqui: Dude-X_: yeah ... who knew you could have fun factorising quadratics
[12:54:55] *AutomatedTester has a few startup ideas for when I leave Mozilla and I would love one of them to be a teaching tool
[12:55:05] Dude-X_: is school of one still a client of yours?
[12:56:55] Dude-X_: hmm dragon box alternates between math and maths on the website. confuses me. 
[12:57:07] pete_otaqui: Dude-X_: I don't think we do much with SoO any more
[12:57:30] Dude-X_: i think they changed their name to New Schools
[12:57:37] Dude-X_: does that name sound familiar

[14:04:35] *AutomatedTester is updating Marionette's errorhandling and noticed that the python code doesnt do unhandled alerts
[14:04:55] AutomatedTester: so looked at the .NET code and saw there is an exception file but nothing references it
[14:05:08] jimevans: could be.
[14:05:09] AutomatedTester: UnhandledAlertException.cs
[14:05:36] jimevans: ah yes.
[14:05:41] jimevans: that's never been implemented.
[14:06:19] jimevans: in theory, it should be thrown if there's an unhandled alert, but that was buggy in the core drivers for so long, i never wired it up in the bindings.
[14:06:29] AutomatedTester: aha
[14:06:39] *AutomatedTester thought he would just mention it
[14:06:47] jimevans: thanks for the reminder.
[14:06:57] jimevans: honestly, i'd forgotten about it.
[14:10:07] AutomatedTester: jimevans: easily happens
[14:10:35] jimevans: i've really let the .net bindings coast for a bit. been concentrating on the IE driver more.
[14:10:42] jimevans: the .net bindings are pretty stable.

[15:03:14] AutomatedTester: youtube appears to be broken
[15:03:31] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, damn.  it's probably still processing on youtube.  it's streaming ok here.
[15:03:44] AutomatedTester: i got a black box
[15:03:46] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, i'll upload somewhere else too.. this thing is super cool :)
[15:06:45] pete_otaqui: cgoldberg: what's the music?

[15:07:51] pete_otaqui: yep it works for me
[15:08:15] AutomatedTester: wow, thats really douche of Google
[15:08:18] pete_otaqui: very poor streaming though (the network seems fine here otherwise)
[15:08:22] AutomatedTester: works in Chrome not in Firefox
[15:09:01] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: looks like a living organism
[15:09:14] pete_otaqui: it's using gource isn't it?
[15:09:21] cgoldberg: yea gource
[15:13:46] AutomatedTester: ok I take it back, they arent blocking Firefox, I may have found a bug
[15:14:49] pete_otaqui: AutomatedTester: works for me in the latest production Firefox (on OS X)

[15:37:04] llaskin: can you wait until a window handle exists?
[15:37:09] hxmws: Hi All,  I'm trying to use selenium-webdriver to replace out website monitoring tool. I'm currently writing this in Ruby.  I have a bit of a noob question. How are you guys capturing errors? are you just waiting for the test to die out? or are you using if statments within the test? 
[15:37:16] mreedell has joined #selenium
[15:37:56] hxmws: if using if statements, how do you tell when a step fails before it dumps the output and kills the test?
[15:38:39] llaskin: hxmws: i use assertions to verify that things work
[15:38:41] llaskin: (rubyist here)
[15:38:50] llaskin: and if the test actually dumps out, thats a good sign of a bug.
[15:39:06] llaskin: but there are times when I want things to fail, and I just do a begin/rescue/end with nothing in the rescue section
[15:39:54] hxmws: iiaskin, ahh, I have seen some examples of assertions. can you explain a little more about these?
[15:40:28] llaskin: hxmws: basically an asssertion is a statement of true or false
[15:40:29] hxmws: i.e do you run the assert then the verify? or is the assert within the verify?
[15:40:29] davehunt: cgoldberg: that is seriously cool :)
[15:40:39] llaskin: assert is the verify
[15:40:40] cgoldberg: davehunt :)
[15:41:20] cgoldberg: assertions check a condition and then throw exception if not met
[15:41:22] llaskin: for example "Assert that imageX exists on screen"  "assert that location.x of element1 is greater then location.x of element2"  etc
[15:41:31] llaskin: cgoldberg: my assertions don't throw an exception
[15:41:34] llaskin: they print out a pass or fail
[15:41:55] llaskin: we still have to do coffee to talk about this sometime....
[15:42:39] cgoldberg: llaskin, interesting.  I use exceptions everywhere in script code.. and then my framework/runner catches everything and then takes action
[15:42:50] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: what are you getting for your new computer?
[15:43:50] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, already got it.  just built a new box.. core i7 (8 thread) 3.4Ghz, 16gigs ram, SSD.. it's a desktop beast
[15:44:18] AutomatedTester: oooooo shiny
[15:44:26] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: mind me asking how much it cost?
[15:44:51] Dude-X: probably 2000 USD if he built it himself
[15:44:59] cgoldberg: i bought it a piece at a time... but I bet I spent about $1200 total
[15:45:07] Dude-X: even better
[15:45:25] Dude-X: i guess SSD is cheaper now-a-days
[15:45:37] *AutomatedTester is due a refresh this year and is contemplating a MBA and a nice desktop linux box
[15:45:52] cgoldberg: yea.. i get small SSD's.. $70-100
[15:45:58] Dude-X: if the new iMac has a retina display, i am so tempted
[15:46:02] AutomatedTester: since I reckon I can get the 2 for less than a MBP
[15:46:33] llaskin: i onlyi allow exceptions when there are serious issues in my code.  Bugs in the system cause a failure, instead of throwing an exception
[15:47:22] cgoldberg: llaskin, interesting.  I come from python world, where exceptions are cheap and happily abused for flow control
[15:47:54] AutomatedTester: I actually hate that about python
[15:47:59] llaskin: ruby allows you to abuse them as well
[15:48:07] AutomatedTester: exceptions used for flow control feels like a smell
[15:48:14] pete_otaqui: AutomatedTester: almost as expensive as an MBP, but you might consider this: http://bartongeorge.net/2012/05/07/introducing-project-sputnik-developer-laptop/
[15:48:14] llaskin: what smell?
[15:48:27] pete_otaqui: especially if you prefer Ubuntu
[15:48:51] hxmws: member:llaskin, do you think it would be possible to see an example of you asserts/verifys
[15:48:57] llaskin: yes i can show you
[15:48:59] llaskin: give me a moment
[15:49:00] AutomatedTester: pete_otaqui: I need OS X for part of my work
[15:49:04] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: do you mean like IteratorStop and similar exceptions
[15:49:11] hxmws: apologies, I'm new to both ruby and webdriver
[15:49:13] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, if you want an awesome Ubuntu desktop, and don't want to build it yourself... check out system76.com
[15:50:05] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: that and if people try do type checking and then throw
[15:50:10] pete_otaqui: cgoldberg: check out the link I posted above.  Looks like Dell is trying to create a whole developer-focused, ubuntu-powered platform around their ultraportable laptop
[15:50:35] cgoldberg: pete_otaqui, yup!  they announced it at UDS a few weeks back.  I'll probably be getting one :)
[15:50:39] AutomatedTester: try: v = int(foo); except: v = str(foo)
[15:50:44] AutomatedTester: things like that
[15:51:37] Dude-X: cgoldberg: do you have one? how does the phyiscal product feel compared to a MacBook Pro?
[15:51:56] cgoldberg: Dude-X, nah I don't have one (yet)
[15:52:25] cgoldberg: Dude-X.. it's an ultrabook... so more like MB Air than MB Pro
[15:52:30] llaskin: hxmws: we all were at some point:)
[15:52:57] llaskin: https://gist.github.com/2836820  spacing got all screwed up in the cut/paste
[15:53:12] hxmws: llaskin, thanks :-) I am so keen to start writing correct tests
[15:53:19] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: i don't have a problem with IteratorStop, but i don't have a philosophy to exceptions
[15:53:26] pete_otaqui: I find it weird in python that (afaik) the only way to test for the existence of an item in the list is to try and access it, and catch the IndexError
[15:53:50] Dude-X: pete_otaqui: if x in l:
[15:53:58] pete_otaqui: really?
[15:53:59] Dude-X: no exception handling there
[15:54:00] Dude-X: yup
[15:54:04] pete_otaqui: and for hashes?
[15:54:11] Dude-X: d.get(x, default)
[15:54:12] pete_otaqui: jeez, I'm so dumb
[15:54:20] Dude-X: even if key in d
[15:54:31] Dude-X: the latter is preferred
[15:56:54] llaskin: hxmws: i have a log class that takes care of a bunch of other things for me
[15:57:02] llaskin: (this is actually part of that class...
[15:57:10] hxmws: ahh ok
[15:57:23] hxmws: dont really get it if i'm honest
[15:58:00] Dude-X: being exposed only to imperative languages like C, C++, Java, I like Python's use of exceptions for flow control; C is probably better because it's easier to debug when you just a set conditon to 0 or whatever but it makes the code a bit more verbose
[15:58:26] hxmws: I was expecting to see, something like erify { assert(@driver.find_element(:tag_name => "body").text.include?("Name"),"Page contains the text NAME")}
[15:58:34] cgoldberg: for some justification of using exceptions judiciously in Python... this is a classic:  http://books.google.com/books?id=JnR9hQA3SncC&lpg=PA134&ots=Jb4ZHx266y&dq=eafp%20martelli&pg=PA134#v=onepage&q&f=false

[IRC logfile - Started Wed May 30 19:00:04 2012]
[19:00:04] lukeis: ok... i'm gonna be no help there.. i just use the default path IE
[19:00:22] phase2: Yeah, that default IE launches IE without an addon installed that I need
[19:00:48] phase2: while the Program Files (x86) IE launches with the addon
[19:01:02] lukeis: can you add the addon to the other one? (the default one)
[19:01:31] phase2: I tried
[19:01:33] phase2: it doesn't stick
[19:02:16] lukeis: welp... IE sux.  the guy who works on the driver on the other hand... he's cool ;)
[19:03:25] phase2: yeah, I was able to change the browserString to "*iexplore <filepath to (x86)>" and it launches fine, just the selenium server won't detect when it's been launched so nothing happens after it initializes

[19:18:52] jimevans: jleyba: safari driver news. i was able to programmatically install the safari extension, simply by manipulating the plist file.
[19:19:49] lukeis: llaskin: if you get the SessionId of the driver, and write your own constructor of a driver, you can pass in just the sessionId and go on your merry way
[19:19:56] llaskin: oh jeezus
[19:19:58] llaskin: ok no
[19:19:59] llaskin: :)
[19:20:06] lukeis: eh, it's not that hard ;)
[19:20:32] jleyba: jimevans: Yeah, I found where that magic plist lives on OS X
[19:20:48] lukeis: the constructor just short circuits all the 'startup a browser' logic... and sets the private sessionId variable
[19:20:50] jleyba: there's a lot I could do for the safaridriver, but at the cost of making safari not very user friendly for non-automated use
[19:21:04] jleyba: (e.g. clean sessions between launches, disabling pop-up blocker, etc)
[19:21:18] jimevans: jleyba: i hear you.
[19:23:10] jleyba: jimevan: I'm half tempted to pull the trigger on that one.  But it's something I've been leaving for when I finish the java test suite
[19:23:26] jimevans: right. i think that does have to take priority.

[19:31:15] qkslvrwolf: lukeis:grid/console works fine
[19:31:25] qkslvrwolf: but wd/hub doesn't work

[19:31:50] qkslvrwolf: {"status":13,"value":{"class":"java.lang.NullPointerException","stackTrace":...
[19:32:11] lukeis: because you're supposed to be posting a desiredCapability to that url
[19:32:22] qkslvrwolf: ok, that makes sense.

[19:33:38] qkslvrwolf: Now i just gotta figure out how to get my upstart jobs to connect to the framebuffer, but that's a question for the ubuntu upstart guys, not you guys.  thanks a lot!
[19:34:09] AJ__: I tried document.element.trigger('tap') and single tap worked... but no luck with 'doubletap'
[19:34:38] lukeis: AJ__: this looks interesting... if you use jquery: https://github.com/technoweenie/jquery.doubletap
[19:35:31] lukeis: all it does is sends two 'tap
[19:35:37] lukeis: events 400 ms apart
[19:36:23] lukeis: err... looks for it
[19:37:14] AJ__: lukeis: yeah.. it actually looks for the event is what i understood.. not simulating..
[19:37:33] lukeis: you're testing a web page though right?
[19:37:40] AJ__: yeah, thats correct
[19:37:44] lukeis: how is the JS listening for the event?
[19:38:04] lukeis: are they using that library? :)
[19:38:38] AJ__: nopes.. :( they are using a different one.. http://appcropolis.com/blog/implementing-doubletap-on-iphones-and-ipads/
[19:40:23] lukeis: looks like you just need to send two 'touchend' events close together
[19:40:29] lukeis: (within 500ms)
[19:41:09] lukeis: touch is gonna be *fun* to implement... soooo many events ;)
[19:41:24] AJ__: yes, but how fast can webdriver send 2 commands to ipad over grid? will that happen within 500ms?
[19:41:26] AJ__: :) I agree.. there are soo many :)
[19:41:38] lukeis: send it as one command?
[19:42:24] AJ__: like.. window.jQuery(document.getElementsByClassName('result-item selected')).trigger('touchend').trigger('touchend');";
[19:48:32] AJ__: lukeis: maaan that worked :).. woow
[19:48:48] lukeis: :)
[19:50:06] AJ__: the most irritating part of ipad testing over grid is loosing the wifi connection in ipad.. its sooo bad.. we had ppl applauding when they saw tests running in multiple ipads through grid.. 
[19:50:59] AJ__: only to later know that we have to wait for wifi issue to be fixed.. sigh!

[21:11:16] stephend: we used to get that all the time, but it was our app/test
[21:11:27] stephend: too much data being executed by the JS parser, client-side
[21:11:43] stephend: although, not that specific error, I should say

[22:25:02] mdgreenfield has left #selenium
[22:26:01] freeone3000: Why do you need cygwin? The standalone server just needs java.
[22:27:50] santiycr1 has joined #selenium
[22:29:45] _noi_: I am coding locally, I am trying to learn VIM and python/django through cygwin and thought you didn't have to setup the standalone server (jar). Is there docs on what would be the best setup if I wanted to do Django development on the win7. at this point I just want it to work with selenium
[22:30:46] _noi_: fyi, thanks freeone3000 for replying to question
[22:31:39] freeone3000: Well, you need cygwin for none of those things. Does running the python script without cygwin work?
[22:31:46] stackedsax: stephend: yeah, 6 six parallel threads per node
[22:31:58] stackedsax: 75 nodes minimum on our grids
[22:32:39] lukeis: _noi_: as freeone3000 you can do all of those techs without cygwin... and cygwin is not supported with selenium
[22:33:00] lukeis: as he said *
[22:36:10] stephend: stackedsax: we did py.test -n 5
[22:36:16] moo-_-: _noi_: I had that kind of error long time ago with ancient selenium version. It was caused by FF update. Then selenium updated and error was gone.
[22:36:27] moo-_-: on SOX
[22:36:29] moo-_-: OSX even
[22:38:48] stackedsax: we usually run testng with 10 parallel threads
[22:39:03] stackedsax: that was for stephend
[22:39:04] _noi_: thanks stackedsax, I do agree I don't need cygwin for all the items I listed and cygwin is not required. I thought it would be nice to just be in console for all my python development needs. I going to have to try my code outside of cygwin I see if selenium test scripts works. 
[22:39:43] stephend: wow
[22:39:54] stephend: how often do you get session-forwarding errors, and do your builds hang?
[22:40:00] freeone3000: _noi_: Windows has a shell now.
[22:40:01] stephend: we have both firefox crashes and hangs
[22:40:55] _noi_: freeone3000: are you referring to the python shell for windows? or powershell
[22:41:18] freeone3000: _noi_: Either would work, but I meant the latter.
[22:41:21] stackedsax: stephend: we get session forwarding errors on the hub â€” is that what you're talking about?
[22:41:25] stephend: yes
[22:43:15] stackedsax: so, for our smoke tests we rarely see the issue, but something in our longer running functional tests trips the issue
[22:43:32] stackedsax: and the grid looks like it's working, but it's actually not
[22:43:38] _noi_: freenode3000: hmm. I need to google that. I didn't know that I could run python/django under powershell
