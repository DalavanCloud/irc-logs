[20:44:13] dawagner: :note santiycr I have a strong suspicion about what's going on which is making our CI flaky.  Is it possible I'm missing some IP ranges from my list of Sauce IP ranges.  Do you log what public IPs your VMs are using? If so, could you tell me what IP 75f44133ebcf47038d576b0497bf5f82 was using? And c75a13a24a1942aa98213d991bd04f10 also? Thanks
[20:44:13] selbot2: ok!

[21:17:13] dawagner: :note santiycr Actually, all of the VMs appear to be in the 172.20/16 range, neither of which were in my list of IPs to expect... Is the traffic going through some proxy or something? I'll set up some experiments to check...

[23:00:19] dawagner: :note santiycr Ok, definitely don't have a complete list of IP ranges, I've just sent an email :)
[23:00:20] selbot2: ok!
[23:01:02] dawagner: :note barancev Worked out why we're seeing CI network connections, working with Sauce to fix it, should be an easy fix when I have the information I need :)
