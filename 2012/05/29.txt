[13:09:14] andreastt: Yes, we use it in OperaDriver.
[13:09:34] Depado_: Are you using Jacoco to calculate code coverage ?
[13:09:45] andreastt: I didn't set it up, let me ask my colleague.
[13:09:55] Depado_: Thanks =)
[13:14:58] Depado_: By the way for those who are interested in unit testing smartGWT with Maven and Selenium I created a little blog with some tutorials. If someone want to get some informations or want to correct some mistakes
[13:16:27] Depado_: http://noobdevelopper.tumblr.com/
[13:16:37] andreastt: Depado_: <danielb> andreastt: I have not tried code coverage with sonar yet. I have tried it locally in eclipse using Emma though and that worked fine.
[13:17:14] Depado_: andreastt Okay thanks. I got some troubles using Jacoco on sonar with jenkins so I was asking.
[13:21:22] dawagner: andreastt: What would you like more of?
[13:21:36] dawagner: Concurrent test runs?

[13:29:30] dawagner: We are *incredibly* wasteful with what we actually run
[13:29:43] dawagner: e.g. updating the operadriver, we shouldn't have to run the Chrome, Firefox and IE tests.
[13:30:15] dawagner: And in fact, we could do with not running every test at every commit; run them all every five (but at least once a day), and have it automatically bisect for us if there are new failures

[15:51:10] dawagner: This, I find unentertaining.
[15:51:19] simonstewart: the closure team are lovely
[15:51:33] dawagner: They are, but I was hoping to be slightly hackier than closure would like
[15:51:46] jimevans: i'm thinking of throwing a spike together that uses named pipes instead of mongoose for the IE server.
[15:52:07] nirvdrum: jimevans: Do you have any objections to adding logging  a la chromedriver?  (I'd imagine not based on your SeConf talk, but don't want to be presumptuous).
[15:52:27] jimevans: nirvdrum: none at all! in fact, i really want that.
[15:53:16] nirvdrum: jimevans: I'd really like to track down where these vsprintf errors are originating from.
[15:53:17] jimevans: i just don't have a really good logging framework to use. chromedriver has the whole chromium stack to pull from.
[15:53:43] jimevans: nirvdrum: good that.
[15:53:44] nirvdrum: I think boost has one that's reasonable.
[15:53:58] nirvdrum: You could even dump to event logger if you wanted, since it's Windows-only already.
[15:54:15] jimevans: true.
[15:54:39] Dude-X: currently i use synthetic events in my tests; when i switch to native events; some tests fail; what can be generalized about these test failures? 
[15:54:55] jimevans: i've avoided boost thus far, because i've been trying to follow the google c++ coding conventions.

[15:57:13] jimevans: simonstewart: yes, we do. and that'd be the way i'd probably go, at least to start with.
[15:58:54] jimevans: i started down the "comprehensive logging" road, but had to stop. i was trying to make it configurable by the language bindings, and ended up plunging down a rabbit hole getting the encapsulation in the C++ code right.
[15:59:14] simonstewart: Yeah

[16:14:35] Dude-X: i see
[16:14:45] Dude-X: but i guess you can use an implicit wait though
[16:15:32] jimevans: that's the rationale for removing it. slowing down execution speed is a crutch. you should be using implicit or explicit waits if you need to wait for the site to do something specific.

[16:26:38] jimevans: "selenium rc" and "selenium webdriver" are API names.
[16:27:08] jimevans: "selenium server" includes server components for remote usage of either api.

[16:47:30] jimevans: dawagner: so how do we set the CI build to set the selenium.browser.native_events property for IE builds to true?
[16:47:57] simonstewart: Create a target in the build.desc files and make sure the WebDriverBuilder is aware of it
[16:47:59] davehunt has joined #selenium
[16:48:10] simonstewart: ("it" being a system property set in the target)

[16:48:56] dawagner: simonstewart: Even though the selenium server is on a different machine to the test runner?
[16:49:15] simonstewart: We end up shoving the values into a DesiredCapabilities object
[16:51:04] jimevans: here's the high-level of the problem. the IE driver should be responding to a capability of "nativeEvents". it's not right now, because the WebDriverBuilder always sets that capability to the value of the "selenium.browser.native_events" system property
[16:51:28] jimevans: for the ci build, i need this capability set to true for the IE builds.
[16:51:40] jimevans: thus i need the property set to true.

[17:03:34] lukeis: WebDriver is bundled in the Selenium package ;)
[17:03:36] diminoten_: yeah
[17:04:10] diminoten_: historically I haven't really given a shit what was and wasn't technically 'selenium;
[17:07:06] jimevans: diminoten_: here's the way to think about it. "Selenium" is the project name. "RC" and "WebDriver" are two APIs included within Selenium. "Selenium 1" and "Selenium 2" are versions of the Selenium project. Selenium 1 included only the RC API, Selenium 2 includes both the RC and WebDriver APIs.
[17:07:19] jimevans: so, historically, you haven't *had* to give a shit.
[17:07:33] jimevans: in the 1.x timeframe, "Selenium" meant "Selenium RC".
[17:07:45] diminoten_: okay yeah that makes sense

[17:07:58] jimevans: nowadays, you have to be more specific, because Selenium includes WebDriver as well as RC now.

[18:50:25] nirvdrum: tnorwood: Scalability really shouldn't be an issue.
[18:51:00] nirvdrum: The hub is pretty lightweight.  Nodes register with it, they sit in a pool, requests come in, they sit in a queue, and things get associated and work is performed.
[18:51:17] nirvdrum: I've run with a couple hundred nodes without incident (or at least without problems I wouldn't have had with a couple nodes).
[18:51:33] nirvdrum: krosenvold did an excellent job reviewing thread safety of the hub.
[18:53:05] tnorwood: nirvdrum: thank you for the info, in our initial tests we started seeing some io issues once we got to 40-50 nodes, I was pretty sure that it was hardware constraints and not selenium, but i wanted to be sure
[18:54:45] nirvdrum: tnorwood: You may need to do some tuning.  Jetty does have a thread pool for its handlers, so you may need to tweak that.
[18:56:01] nirvdrum: tnorwood: If you find otherwise, please file a bug or let us know.  We expect to be able to scale up at least as well as running on a local machine.
[18:56:06] tnorwood: nirvdrum: cool, like i said we are still in planning stages now and I just wanted to be sure what we were attempting was even possible, i'm sure once we get into actual implementation I'll have more questions

[20:19:08] jarib: i just found this https://gist.github.com/2830127
[20:19:41] jarib: the 2.22 release broke a test in watir-webdriver, i'm suspecting r16873?

[20:20:52] jarib: it's an <img>
[20:21:36] jleyba: I hate a) boolean attributes, and b) the lack of a getProperty method in the WebDriver API
[20:21:57] jarib: hehe
[20:22:19] jarib: yeah, it's frustrating
[20:22:45] jarib: apparently img.complete is special somehow?
[20:23:03] jleyba: I honestly wasn't trying to change behavior.  There was a test case marked @Ignore, so I fixed it, and unleased a shit storm
[20:23:25] jleyba: complete is a boolean attribute
[20:23:36] jimevans: jleyba: i had my raincoat. no problem, man. :)
[20:24:03] jleyba: If it is not specifically specified, getAttribute will return null
[20:24:20] jleyba: executeScript, in your gist, is hitting the property
[20:24:42] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I didnt mean to make it come across as a shit storm 
[20:24:44] AutomatedTester: sorry
[20:25:16] jleyba: AutomatedTester: No worries.  I think every one of the core contributors has pinged me about that change :)
[20:26:58] jarib: jleyba: "specifically specified" meaning "in the markup"?
[20:27:07] jimevans: for my part, i just wanted to make sure i didn't screw up something you were trying to do in that change. that's why i was such a pain about it. :)
[20:27:32] jleyba: jarib: In the markup or via element.setAttribute
[20:27:36] jarib: right
[20:27:50] jleyba: /javascript/atoms/dom.js lists complete as a boolean attribute
[20:28:02] jleyba: which is why this logic is triggering
[20:28:16] jarib: ok
[20:28:36] jarib: but we should fall back to looking at the property, no?
[20:28:41] jarib: even for booleans.
[20:28:46] jleyba: ...maybe we should roll this change back...boolean attributes will always return true or false, never null
[20:31:26] jarib: well, returning null instead of "false" is nice because null will actually evaluate to false in most languages
[20:31:47] jarib: which the string "false" will not
[20:33:08] jleyba: Right..b/c getAttribute returns a string
[20:33:21] jleyba: Have I mentioned I wish we had a getProperty function?
[20:33:31] jarib: the problem in this case is that we're returning null for an attribute where the property value is true
[20:33:36] jarib: you did, yeah
[20:33:57] jarib: WebElement.getAttribute docs: More exactly, this method will return the value of the given attribute, unless that attribute is not present, in which case the value of the property with the same name is returned. If neither value is set, null is returned.
[20:34:24] jleyba: Ok...so for booleans, we want: if the attribute is set, return true.  If the property is true, return true. Otherwise, return null
[20:34:34] jarib: also, "The following are deemed to be "boolean" attributes, and will return either "true" or null.
[20:34:47] jarib: jleyba: yeah, that sounds correct to me
[20:36:55] jleyba: have we actually pushed 2.22.0?
[20:37:22] Dude-X: for java and python yes
[20:37:27] Dude-X: and .net?

[20:44:35] jleyba: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/webdriver/atoms/element.js#95
[20:44:49] barancev: why shouldContinueToWorkIfUnableToFindElementById is in the class FirefoxDriverTest? what is specific to firefox in this test case?
[20:45:27] jleyba: I don't have access to a selenium client atm, but we should just need to change that then-clause to
[20:45:27] jleyba: value = bot.dom.getAttribute(element, attribute) || bot.dom.getProperty(element, attribute); return value ? 'true' : null;
[20:46:13] jleyba: barancev: That just means it was added after someone found a bug while working directly on the FirefoxDriver
[20:46:21] jarib: jleyba: let me try that out
[20:47:00] jleyba: barancev: I've got some tests I'll be committing for the SafariDriver that test cross-domain functionality. There's nothing Safari-specific about them, but I'm too lazy to test all the other browsers, so there going in as Safari only :)

[22:02:21] stephend|mtg: there was a change, when I get time to dig, I can find it.  Pretty sure dawagner knows about it, though :-)

[22:03:27] Dude-X: right now i run tests in java using firefox 3.6 (soon will upgrade to 10.esr)
[22:03:38] lukeis: i usually only need synthetic and try for just them (I'm often running FF on mac)
[22:03:47] Dude-X: but i am also evaluating wheher or not to use synthetic events
[22:03:50] jimevans: with apologies to Winston Churchill, native events are the worst way of interacting with an element, except for all of the other ways.
[22:03:58] Dude-X: haha
[22:04:22] Dude-X: err native events
[22:04:50] freeone3000: I like native events. They trigger all the side effects of even the oddest pages, with the small caveat of also triggering all the side effects.
[22:05:08] Dude-X: can you give me an example freeone3000?
[22:05:43] freeone3000: Dude-X: Okay. If an ActiveX control is listening for a key event, synthetic events may not trigger it, but native ones do. However, if I leave the cursor hovering over an item, I get the tooltip text showing up above my other windows.
[22:06:17] Dude-X: some legacy cruft I have in my test suite is where the previous dev uses javascript to select things in a dropdown menu :/
[22:06:55] Dude-X: freeone3000: that is interesting

[22:16:33] AutomatedTester: but now that I have moved my office around I can use ethernet
[22:16:40] AutomatedTester: zomg it much faster
[22:16:53] jarib: yeah, wifi sucks 
[22:17:00] jarib has altered jarib's mode: -o
[22:17:09] lukeis: my home wifi constantly kicks me off irc unless i'm logged onto vpn... so weird
[22:17:32] AutomatedTester: everything was slowing down, including accessing the modem
[22:17:45] jarib: lukeis: almost sounds like your ISP is messing with your traffic
[22:17:48] AutomatedTester: in the same room, with clear line of site between MBP and modem
[22:17:54] lukeis: likely...
[22:18:13] jarib: AutomatedTester: yeah, i've just "upgraded" my connection at home, which meant i had to get a new router
[22:18:33] *AutomatedTester wishes he had fibre into the house
[22:18:37] Dude-X: apples airport extreme is pretty good
[22:18:39] jarib: now i'm seeing occasional request timeouts just pinging the router. 
[22:18:44] jarib: not fun
[22:18:50] AutomatedTester: jarib:  thats what I have
[22:19:06] Dude-X: no UPnP but if you port forward some of the things, it works without much work
[22:19:13] AutomatedTester: but I can only have ethernet when my boy isnt running around
[22:19:34] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: I am tempted to get an airport
[22:19:41] AutomatedTester: lots of people say its worthwhile
[22:19:50] jimevans_ has joined #selenium
[22:20:38] Dude-X: it is! gigabit ports work well, it can handle high traffic on ethernet, it has wireless n, g, iphone and ipad never trouble connecting to the wifi
[22:20:41] freeone3000: No upnp? That's uh. That's pretty broken.
[22:20:44] Dude-X: never have to reset it peridoically
[22:21:03] Dude-X: it comes wth apple's standard for UPnP
[22:21:05] Dude-X: forgot the name
[22:21:10] Dude-X: but uTorrent on windows supports it
[22:21:16] freeone3000: Bonjour, the zero-conf that isn't.
[22:21:23] Dude-X: it's not bonjour
[22:21:28] Dude-X: supports that too though
[22:21:39] Dude-X: PMP-CEC or something
[22:21:48] Dude-X: or NAT-something
[22:22:39] *AutomatedTester goes to finish his marionette patch
[22:22:39] jarib: i'm also spoiled from the 90 Mb/s connection at work
[22:22:56] AutomatedTester: jarib: that is nice

[22:23:48] *AutomatedTester would have a better connection if I moved to a city
[22:23:57] AutomatedTester: but there is a problem with that

[22:32:30] Dude-X: woot
[22:33:16] jarib: just checking a couple of things on windows, then i'll push
[22:34:07] killler: does webdriver have "is_text_present"?
[22:34:51] andreastt_: jarib: I'm spoiled by a 4 Gb/s connection at work, which makes my home connection of 60 Mb/s seem very slow.
[22:35:17] jarib: andreastt_: now you're just teasing me
[22:35:24] *jarib cries
[22:35:31] andreastt_: Why, oh why is that still flakey?
[22:35:47] Dude-X: you're in Norway, andreastt_?
[22:35:52] andreastt_: Dude-X: Yes.
[22:36:01] Dude-X: is it easy to emigrate there?
[22:36:06] andreastt_: Dude-X: It helps, though, to work for a browser vendor.
[22:36:22] AutomatedTester: andreastt_: you are a jerk! *i can only be nasty when this jealous*
[22:36:38] jimevans: killler: no, sorry. a workaround would be driver.findElement(By.tagName("body")).getText();
[22:36:53] Dude-X: andreastt_: the USA doesn't seem like a place to raise a family with all these shysters controlling everything
[22:37:11] killler: jimevans: and if it's not there it would return null?
[22:37:20] Dude-X: it would throw an exception
[22:37:38] killler: that's not very helpful
[22:37:39] AutomatedTester: when the UK decends into turmoil I will move to Norway... if only they would just let me move in
[22:38:01] Dude-X: actually it would throw an exception on findElement, not sure about getText other than StaleElementReferenceException
[22:38:12] killler: I'll give it a shot
[22:38:17] Dude-X: I am looking at sweden and Norway
[22:38:19] killler: thinking of just going back to RC at this point
[22:38:33] jimevans: okay hold on a minute. all that would do is give you the text of the body element.
[22:38:39] jimevans: it wouldn't do a comparison.
[22:38:44] jimevans: or contains.
[22:39:24] AutomatedTester: killler: why are you doing a is_text_present? in SeRC its considered bad practise since it really slows down the test and can give false positives
[22:39:28] jimevans: you'd need to use your language of choice's string functions to determine if the page's text contains what you're looking for.
[22:40:49] killler: AutomatedTester: not exacly using it for testing, just writing a quick macro script since I already have selenium installed
[22:41:25] AutomatedTester: ok, it will possibly give false positives then
[22:41:33] AutomatedTester: and still make you macro run slow
[22:41:53] brettporter has joined #selenium
[22:41:57] killler: if you can suggest a better macro scripting program that would be ideal
[22:42:12] AutomatedTester: killler: what are you trying to solve
[22:42:19] opapo has joined #selenium
[22:42:36] killler: filling out forms basically
[22:43:46] AutomatedTester: are these modern sites?
[22:44:17] Odd_Bloke has joined #selenium
[22:44:27] killler: yeah, it's a little more complicated than that. selenium was just the first tool that came to mind
[22:44:51] jarib: Dude-X: if you're coming here for a job, it should be pretty simple. especially if it's a good paying one (you'll be considered a "specialist")
[22:45:12] AutomatedTester: well, personally I think going down the is_element_present route will end in tears
[22:45:28] AutomatedTester: you might as well get the page source, parse that and then guess what you want
[22:45:38] AutomatedTester: apply some basic heuristics
[22:45:44] AutomatedTester: well thats my 2p
[22:45:46] Dude-X: jarib: do immigrants get to partake in the social benefits?

[22:46:28] jimevans: g'night everybody
[22:46:29] jimevans has left #selenium
[22:46:29] freeone3000: Sometimes, selenium is able to find an element identified by id. Sometimes, it is not. No test changes, no page changes, simply running the same test twice produces different results. What could cause this?
[22:46:34] Dude-X: night jim
[22:46:48] Dude-X: freeone3000: welcome to webdriver flakiness :p
[22:47:24] jarib: uhm, that's misleading. it's not webdriver being flaky
[22:48:30] Dude-X: alright i take it back; it's that javascript on the browser is not quite so deterministic
[22:48:43] AutomatedTester: having a network in the way makes webdriver appear flaky
[22:49:37] Dude-X: in what ways can the network fail?
[22:50:30] freeone3000: It's a guest-to-host NAT virtualization that uses the link-local network. I suppose that could be partially it, but I don't want the problem to be there. Firefox 12, Selenium standalone 2.22, because I have to run tests in the guest but the guest doesn't have X.
[22:50:42] jarib: freeone3000: if the DOM is being built/manipulated after the onload event, you may need to wait excplicitly for elements to be present. webdriver doesn't try to guess what you consider "finished loading" besides the onload event firing
[22:51:02] freeone3000: jarib: I've configured a 1500 ms implicit wait. Won't that be triggered?
[22:51:04] AutomatedTester: browser opens, tries to connect to web app and something the middle causes a few packets to fail causing the nic to request them which then makes things not load in the same order
[22:51:10] jarib: Dude-X: if you're seriously interested: http://www.udi.no/Norwegian-Directorate-of-Immigration/Central-topics/Work-and-residence/
[22:51:17] AutomatedTester: especially since browsers open 15+ ports and start downloads
[22:51:21] Dude-X: jarib: thx
[22:51:36] AutomatedTester: and the ports are reused in a random order
[22:51:48] jarib: freeone3000: that will help if it takes less than 1500ms for it to appear, yes
[22:52:16] freeone3000: jarib: I'm getting timeouts with 793ms and similar.
[22:52:21] AutomatedTester: woop! I can move from the UK without issue

[22:53:57] jarib: thanks :)
[22:54:22] AutomatedTester: lukeis: would it really? sounds like a good idea just like Scotland leaving the UK
[22:54:55] wilhelm: I don't have EU citizenship, but can move freely around on this continent anyway. Why buy the cow when you get the milk for just a few billion? (c:
[22:55:42] lukeis: AutomatedTester: yup it would really... since california gets somewhere around 50¢ for every $1 it gives to the Fed
[22:56:33] *leev wishes he has eu citizenship as well
[22:56:34] freeone3000: Oh. Apparently it's jquery weirdness. Extending the timeout helped some of the time, and not assuming that the IDs of DOM elements stayed constant fixed some other things. Thanks.
[22:56:44] leev: i'm in the UK on a tier2 visa
[22:56:47] leev: from australia

[IRC logfile - Started Tue May 29 23:00:14 2012]
[23:00:14] lukeis: why do you need it as a Char?
[23:00:23] Dude-X: i have a wrapper function
[23:00:29] AutomatedTester: lol... I broke tmux
[23:00:31] Dude-X: but i need to call Keys.ESCAPE
[23:00:33] lukeis: sounds like that needs updateing ;)
[23:00:39] AutomatedTester: dont attach to a session from inside that session
[23:00:44] Dude-X: i guess i'll change it from String to CharSequence
[23:00:44] moo-_-: is there a way to make Firefox (and other browsers) not pop up in Dock when running tests on OSX?
[23:01:02] AutomatedTester: moo-_-: nope
[23:01:10] moo-_-: :<
[23:01:28] AutomatedTester: moo-_-: raise a bug with Apple :/
[23:01:30] Dude-X: is there such a thing as xvfb for the mac
[23:01:31] *moo-_- was secretly hoping for a command line switch or something
[23:01:37] moo-_-: Dude-X: yes
[23:01:46] moo-_-: there is xvfb
[23:01:51] moo-_-: though native OSX applications don't run there
[23:01:59] Dude-X: yeah
[23:02:03] moo-_-: some kind of half-way there port
[23:02:18] moo-_-: Dude-X: but don't even consider it, I tried it like year ago
[23:02:34] jarib: moo-_-: why do you care if it pops up in the Dock?
[23:02:52] moo-_-: jarib: for continuous testing on the background 
[23:02:55] Dude-X: it's not intrustive
[23:03:15] moo-_-: I can live with it
[23:03:19] moo-_-: I was just hoping for a solution :)
[23:03:20] jarib: ok, so it's not really about the Dock then
[23:04:17] jarib: moo-_-: i'd do virtualbox + a light linux vm (maybe ubuntu server + a minimal X install)
[23:05:17] Dude-X: actually i'd recommend parallels or vmware fusion, i find virtualbox so shitty on my mac at home
[23:05:25] Dude-X: but you can't beat free
[23:08:00] *AutomatedTester just learnt a new thing about tmux
