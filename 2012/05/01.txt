[16:15:12] dawagner: test...
[16:15:23] dawagner: http://illicitonion.com/selogs/
[16:16:05] lukeis: nice
[16:16:08] jimevans: whee!
[16:16:13] jimevans: nice one, dawagner
[16:16:39] lukeis: dawagner: i saved off the logs from 2011-02-10 to 2011-10-07 if you want to host them too
[16:17:01] dawagner: Sure, if you dump them somewhere I can happily dump them up
[16:17:24] lukeis: it's 14M
[16:17:28] dawagner: Awesome :)
[16:18:04] jarib: bsilverberg: https://gist.github.com/2568723
[16:18:27] dawagner: jarib: Where did you scrape that from?
[16:18:38] jarib: dawagner: code is on the bottom :)
[16:18:39] dawagner: aha, the script is below :)
[16:18:47] jarib: it's from the spec
[16:18:54] dawagner: Nice!
[16:19:00] jarib: in particular the version of the spec that's currently in the watir-webdriver repo
[16:19:01] lukeis: dawagner: check your gmail
[16:19:47] bsilverberg: nice! thanks jarib 
[16:20:40] jarib: the webidl syntax keeps changing, i need to fix my parser to make it work for the latest and greatest spec
[16:20:49] jarib: bsilverberg: yw :)
[16:21:05] barancev: IE is upsetting me...
[16:21:09] jarib: actually i should probably not write my own parser..
[16:21:13] barancev: <div id="zero-size"><img src="" width="0" height="0"/></div> -- isDisplayed = true
[16:21:25] barancev: <div id="transparent" style="opacity:0">transparent</div> -- true again
[16:21:48] zac_sel_: ie has not discovered the concept of 0 yet :D
[16:21:58] dawagner: lukeis: Uploaded :)
[16:22:00] barancev: does not it use isShown atom?
[16:22:59] lukeis: if i'd known i would have dumped more... i only wrote a script to grab those logs cause I was looking for something that was mentioned and didn't know when (yay to be able to use grep)
[16:23:18] jimevans: barancev: it does, in point of fact, use the isShown atom.
[16:23:49] barancev: well, this zero-size div is (965, 1) in IE
[16:24:01] bsilverberg: So, if we change bot.dom.getAttribute to *not* normalize the attributes and then enhance webdriver.atoms.element.getAttribute to do the normalization, will that be ok for other users of the atoms? Does everyone go through webdriver? And if the answer is "maybe" then do we just make the change and see what, if anything, breaks?
[16:24:21] dawagner: I'd say make the change and see what happens
[16:25:08] jimevans: or, more explicitly, it use the isDisplayed atom, which explicitly is bot.dom.isShown
[16:25:25] jimevans: if that javascript function is misbehaving, you'll need to debug the javascript.
[16:25:34] barancev: yes, isShow must be correct but it's no matter as IE thinks that size is > 0
[16:26:13] jimevans: barancev: it *does* matter.
[16:26:19] bsilverberg: but you're saying that in theory we should be able to change the behaviour of atoms as long as we make a corresponding change to js/webdriver?
[16:26:35] dawagner: Yes
[16:26:35] jimevans: the *only* thing isDisplayed() does in the IE driver is call isShown and return the result.
[16:27:06] bsilverberg: cool :-)
[16:27:07] barancev: jimevans: it sounds to be getSize problem, not isShown
[16:27:34] jimevans: but you're saying the problem is in isDisplayed...
[16:28:22] barancev: jimevans: I thought that isDisplayed should return false for <div id="zero-size"><img src="" width="0" height="0"/></div>
[16:28:24] jimevans: sorry, let me rephrase. you're saying you're seeing incorrect behavior when you call WebElement.isDisplayed(), right? or am I misreading your comments.
[16:28:34] bsilverberg: jarib: do you have a url for the source of that info which I can add to a comment? I assume pointing at the gist in a comment would not be a good idea
[16:28:36] barancev: IE returns true
[16:29:25] barancev: but at the same time it returns non-zero size  (965, 1) for this element
[16:29:35] jimevans: i believe you, that IE returns true for that particular element. what I'm asking is what does bot.dom.isShown() return for the same element in IE?
[16:29:40] barancev: that's wrong too and looks like the root cause
[16:30:12] jimevans: if that's the root cause, then it's in the javascript called by bot.dom.isShown().
[16:31:03] dawagner: I hate flaky tests.
[16:31:11] jimevans: listen carefully to what i'm telling you. the *only* thing WebElement.isDisplayed() does in IE is call bot.dom.IsShown(). whether that atom does checking of the element size, i have no idea.
[16:31:25] barancev: it does
[16:31:31] barancev: // Any element without positive size dimensions is not shown
[16:31:38] jimevans: but the C++ code of the driver does not do any further checking outside of whatever that javascript function returns.
[16:31:53] barancev: it checks bot.dom.getElementSize(e) to be non-zero
[16:32:07] jimevans: then the problem is in the atom.
[16:32:19] barancev: that, in its term, uses goog.style.getSize(element)
[16:32:32] barancev: s/term/turn/

[16:34:07] dawagner: For the record, pizza with a hot dog in the curst is amazing.
[16:34:23] jimevans: although it's entirely possible that IE renders an empty div as a 1-pixel element.
[16:34:34] jimevans: which would be stupid, but not surprising.

[17:17:13] lukeis: benadderson: likely, yes
[17:19:51] benadderson: lukeis: thanks. Any idea of timescales? Looks like there was some discussion on the mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/selenium-developers/ie$20driver/selenium-developers/vf98uN0NOAI/FYarpCGDhbwJ)  but nothing since Feb?
[17:20:21] jleyba has joined #selenium
[17:20:55] lukeis: um, i doubt you'll ever get anything concrete out of selenium for dates ;) .. but yeah, I would say in the next couple of releases it'll be around (depends on how much time jim can spend outside of work, etc to work on it!)
[17:21:32] benadderson: Sure, I had assumed the answer would be in terms of versions, not dates ;)
[17:21:59] lukeis: if i had to guess, 2.23+ will be using it
[17:22:00] benadderson: I'm just trying to figure when I'm going to change our grid
[17:22:18] lukeis: doubtful for 2.22

[18:42:53] santiycr: dawagner, barancev: hi
[18:43:13] santiycr: let's talk about IEDriverServer ;)
[18:47:05] barancev: I'm here
[18:48:31] santiycr: what's up?
[18:48:33] barancev: I have a CI-related question. I've created a patch for the java binding to use IEDriverServer.exe, but postpone to commit it because it should break the build on CI if the is no IEDriverServer.exe in PATH
[18:49:58] barancev: we need to install IEDriverServer.exe on CI-server (upload and setup environment)
[18:50:50] santiycr: I see
[18:50:58] santiycr: got it
[18:51:05] santiycr: let me fix that :)
[18:51:09] barancev: ok
[18:52:48] jeichar has joined #selenium
[18:54:19] dawagner: santiycr: We'd like to be able to upload or unpack the server like with the selenium server jar, though
[18:54:36] santiycr: oh boy
[18:54:38] santiycr: :)
[18:54:47] kenck has joined #selenium
[18:55:04] santiycr: you guys haven't needed that for chromedriver :)
[18:55:19] barancev: dawagner: is not it like chromedriver.exe?
[18:55:21] dawagner: We don't own the chromedriver
[18:55:32] dawagner: So we don't test changes to it, the chrome team do
[18:55:37] santiycr: damn, I knew the answer to that one :)
[18:55:56] dawagner: Sorry :p
[18:56:06] santiycr: ok, let's start by placing IEDriverServer 
[18:56:12] santiycr: then we'll figure out how to make it more flexible
[18:56:31] dawagner: Thanks :)
[18:56:34] dawagner: (Sorry :p)
[18:56:37] santiycr: no need to be sorry!
[18:56:45] santiycr: you guys are making shit happen
[18:57:22] jarib: jimevans: do the .NET bindings support both the standalone executable and the DLL at the moment?
[18:57:23] barancev: if it was unpacked somewhere from the distr, we would use a property to set path to the executable
[18:57:46] barancev: jarib: yes, .net supports both
[18:57:56] jarib: how does it decide what to use?
[18:58:05] barancev: jarib: my patch will provide support for both too
[18:58:27] barancev: it's useLegacyInternalServer capability
[18:58:27] jimevans: jarib: yes.
[18:58:44] jarib: ok, a capability
[18:58:54] jimevans: jarib: there's a capability, but in reality, it mostly depends on which constructor you use.

[IRC logfile - Started Tue May  1 19:00:34 2012]
[19:00:34] barancev: jimevans: what constructor to use to get dll-based server?
[19:01:22] jimevans: any constructor that doesn't take a string, or pass in an explicit InternetExplorerOptions instance will use the library-based server.
[19:01:41] sumxyz1 has joined #selenium
[19:01:57] ssims_ has joined #selenium
[19:02:18] jimevans: when the Java bindings include support for the standalone server, i'll reverse that, and make the standalone server the default constructor.
[19:02:59] jimevans: incidentally, if you embed the .exe in the jar and extract at runtime, you'll run the risk of anti-virus scanners throwing false positives.
[19:03:37] jimevans: it also hamstrings us from being able to rev the standalone server outside of a full-stack Selenium release.
[19:05:24] jimevans: ok
[19:07:13] barancev: btw, will it be possible to run multiple Ies on the same machine with this new executable server?
[19:07:30] jimevans: should be.
[19:07:32] lukeis: santiycr / dawagner : when we find some time we should also hook the iOS tests in to sauce (or whenever sauce enables that for "us" to consume ios...)
[19:09:13] jimevans: though i confess no huge depth of testing there.
[19:11:02] santiycr: barancev: any jar I can use to test the IEDriverServer?
[19:13:22] santiycr: lukeis: indeed
[19:13:46] santiycr: lukeis: we need to dynamically download the webdriver ios app, right?
[19:13:51] barancev: santiycr: if you can run it from console using the same account that runs test - it's ok
[19:14:22] barancev: I don't know how to build a small jar for testing purposes
[19:14:49] barancev: but I can share my patched selenium-server-standalone.jar
[19:14:52] santiycr: ./go release
[19:15:03] santiycr: or that :)
[19:15:08] santiycr: patching jars is fun
[19:15:27] retornam has joined #selenium
[19:15:43] barancev: I mean built with go release from the patched source, of course :)
[19:15:51] barancev: a moment...
[19:16:23] santiycr: oh, that's what I'm looking for
[19:16:31] santiycr: a url to the jar would work
[19:19:09] santiycr: Dude-X: man, the first 5 minutes suck
[19:19:24] lukeis: santiycr: yep, we'll need to do that... well, once we get a OSX build server to actually build it :-/
[19:19:36] santiycr: slept through my alarm and made it to the venue 3 minutes before my talk started. My stress levels were to the roof
[19:19:45] Dude-X: wow
[19:20:55] santiycr: Dude-X: the content should be useful. I'm pretty proud of the ideas that went in it
[19:20:57] Dude-X: just got another email in LinkedIn from a recruiter looking for a selenium test writer
[19:21:20] santiycr: lukeis: fun
[19:21:29] santiycr: lukeis: let's talk about that in 1 or 2 months
[19:21:37] lukeis: sounds good
[19:21:38] santiycr: lukeis: we got lots of servers
[19:28:59] eanxgeek: I have just recently started plaing with Select() ... in python with WD ... can someone tell me if Select() support multi-select?
[19:30:02] eanxgeek: I'm thinking it does as long as I don't pass a deselect() in between multiple select() calls
[19:30:14] lukeis: yes it does
[19:30:22] eanxgeek: i.e. for item in list: select(item)
[19:30:39] Dude-X: select works as long you don't have an ajaxy like select that renders on top of generic <Select> tags
[19:31:27] eanxgeek: yeah I already have one select working however, in going over some scenarios it turns out there are two places in the webui where I could in theory test using multiple select.  
[19:31:44] eanxgeek: manually this multiple select would occur by a [ctrl]+left mouse click
[19:31:45] santiycr: barancev: got a commit that downloads and places IEDriverServer in our boxes
[19:31:50] santiycr: just need to test it
[19:32:07] eanxgeek: in selenium terms I assume I can just keep calling select() and it will continue to add to my selected items 
[19:32:16] eanxgeek: deselect() would deselect() all
[19:32:18] santiycr: barancev: whenever you have a jar, we'll run a test and put it live
[19:32:19] barancev: santiycr: I'm doing go release
[19:32:24] santiycr: cool
[19:32:46] barancev: I'm on the laptop atm, that's not very fast
[19:32:58] Dude-X: santiycr: i like the idea of guinea pigs
[19:33:16] Dude-X: it lets the UI desiginers make changes and just run that set of tests
[19:33:27] santiycr: barancev: no rush, I have plenty of things to do in the meantime :)
[19:33:44] santiycr: Dude-X: yeah, guinea pigs and state generation and my favorite tips
[19:33:55] santiycr: Dude-X: not too many people do them
[19:34:02] ian_mac has joined #selenium
[19:34:15] Dude-X: i don't have state generation, but i do have fixtures
[19:34:32] santiycr: Dude-X: well, it's fixtures + mocking sessions
[19:34:38] Dude-X: but the devs have to show us how the fixture framework works
[19:34:58] santiycr: not just creating the data in the DB, but also being able to place your browser in the middle of a UI workflow without having to do the prior steps
[19:35:00] Dude-X: sometimes the devs will add  internal webservice calls that let us reset app state and other neat thinsg
[19:35:16] Dude-X: for our app, i think fixtures is generally enough
[19:35:25] Dude-X: it would be faster to just jump to that state
[19:35:46] Dude-X: but i don't think it would speed things up dramatically
[19:36:04] santiycr: generally, just a simple login step before every test will add unnecessary minutes to your build

[20:08:20] santiycr: barancev: or will it just use the IEDriver server out of the box?
[20:09:05] barancev: by default it should use IEDriverServer.exe
[20:09:31] barancev: if you want old dll-based server, set useLegacyInternalServer capability

[20:30:22] MadMerlin|work: is there a se-ide exporter that can export php webdriver code?
[20:30:49] lukeis: heh... the question would be to which php webdriver code ;)
[20:30:54] santiycr: barancev: are you searching in path only?
[20:31:02] MadMerlin|work: i found a php exporter plugin, but it seems to only export to the old style
[20:31:12] lukeis: i don't think anyone has written one
[20:31:41] MadMerlin|work: hmm, that's unfortunate
[20:31:41] santiycr: cuz I'm setting the webdriver.ie.driver system property

[20:43:19] AutomatedTester: jimevans: were you shocked that by my tweet? :)
[20:43:19] dawagner: Thanks andreast :)
[20:43:23] lukeis: you need to upgrade to 2.21 (and even then i think there's a few bugs with FF12)
[20:43:43] eanxgeek: sob my system did update to ff12
[20:43:52] eanxgeek: I don't remember giving the green light on that 
[20:43:54] eanxgeek: errrrrr
[20:43:59] eanxgeek: I hate computers
[20:44:27] AutomatedTester: eanxgeek: unfortunately we are like Chrome now
[20:44:41] AutomatedTester: because people found the UI for "Do you want to update" scary

[20:45:06] AutomatedTester: dawagner: still waiting for that patch from Google
[20:45:11] AutomatedTester: then less will break
[20:45:33] eanxgeek: I agree, update screens are scary ;-) you know what's more scary - automatic updates letting technology make decisions for me

[20:51:08] AutomatedTester: I want everything session/*
[20:52:03] santiycr: jimevans: can I just download that dll? or do I need to install something I'm missing?
[20:53:10] Dude-X: this says /session/(.*?)/((element/(.*?)/)?(.*)) -> grab all /session/ any here / element / maybe anything here, and whatever else
[20:53:46] Dude-X: session/ any here / element / maybe anything here with a /, and whatever else
[20:54:06] Dude-X: seems like it won't grab element/fin

[20:54:23] Dude-X: brb
[20:54:34] barancev: santiycr: never seen this
[20:55:13] lukeis: AutomatedTester: do you want to replace it or something what groupings do you want... cause session.* matches ;)
[20:55:37] santiycr: barancev: alrigth, going the brute force route and placing the dll in windows\system

[21:49:55] jimevans: barancev: does your patch implement auto-start and auto-shutdown of the standalone server (if using the "service" model)?
[21:50:07] jimevans: (i would assume so)
[21:50:17] barancev: jimevans: yes
[21:50:47] jimevans: and the auto-shutdown is accomplished by calling the /shutdown url?
[21:50:50] lukeis: yeah... so about 9 seconds to start it, not bad ;)

[21:54:14] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: /session/(.*?)($|/((\w+/(.*?)/)?(.*)))'
[21:54:19] AutomatedTester: thats the regex I have now
[21:54:21] AutomatedTester: it works for me
[21:54:27] AutomatedTester: well my test data
[21:54:28] jimevans: i see approx. 8 seconds to load saucelabs.com.

[21:55:24] jimevans: anyway, good to see it working. :)
[21:55:32] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: yeah that will work for your purpose
[21:55:56] jimevans: means i didn't screw things up too badly. :)
[21:56:05] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: I hardly use regex so when I do I have to relearn things
[21:56:35] Dude-X: i remember the basics and play with those regex tester websites
[21:56:44] lukeis: AutomatedTester: and you call yourself a vim man... pffft
[21:56:53] barancev: jimevans: yes, stop uses /shutdown url
[21:57:21] jimevans: groovy.
[21:57:25] AutomatedTester: lukeis: I dont replace code on a regular basis
[21:57:35] AutomatedTester: and can find things with just /
[21:57:47] barancev: I've unified chrome service and ie service, but...
[21:58:12] barancev: there were two calls for chrome: /status and /healtz
[21:58:40] jimevans: yes, based on which version of chromedriver.exe you might have.
[21:58:40] barancev: .Net binding makes only /status when starts chromedriver
[21:58:48] lukeis: :%s is basically muscle memory for me ;) and regex replacement <3
[21:59:00] barancev: Java calls both /status and /healtz
[21:59:02] jimevans: yes, because i made a judgement call to only support modern versions of chromedriver. :)
[21:59:05] santiycr: lukeis: it was downloading a custom jar ;)
[21:59:17] lukeis: figured that after seeing the log
[21:59:45] barancev: what's more right: Java or .Net behavior?
[IRC logfile - Started Tue May  1 22:00:31 2012]
[22:00:31] jimevans: i think the "right" behavior is to support the latest version of chromedriver.exe, and that's it.
[22:00:57] jimevans: the hue and cry over having to download an executable from a separate website is a red herring.
[22:01:07] barancev: so /healtz is not needeв anymore?
[22:01:13] barancev: needed
[22:01:28] jimevans: if you can't configure your damned environment to call wget or curl to download the fucking file, you've got bigger problems.
[22:01:45] jimevans: i believe /healthz is deprecated.
[22:02:13] jimevans: and anyway, /status is part of the protocol documentation now anyway.
[22:02:13] lukeis: can't remember which version switch to status... i think 1022
[22:02:45] barancev: at least it passes all the tests without /healthz
[22:03:15] jimevans: i can't remember, do the java bindings check /status or /healthz first?
[22:03:51] barancev: new UrlChecker().waitUntilAvailable(20, SECONDS, status, healthz);
[22:04:17] jimevans: oh, right. they do it *that* way.
[22:04:40] kallisti: what on earth is healthz
[22:05:10] jimevans: kallisti: it was the "check to see if i'm alive" url implemented by the chromedriver.exe.
[22:05:21] jimevans: before /status was introduced/.

[22:46:13] jarib: :note jimevans would be good to have a --host option for the IEDriverServer, right now you can launch it multiple times on the same port (and it will bind to that port on multiple interfaces)

[22:48:05] jarib: :note alternatively force it to bind to AF_INET only (at least on my Win7 VM "localhost" resolves to either AF_INET (127.0.0.1) or AF_INET6 (::1)

[23:13:46] lawcab: how about something like //div[contains(@id,'resultsContent')]/ul/li
[23:13:54] lawcab: i will try toyr way
[23:14:01] lawcab: i will try it your way
[23:14:27] Dude-X: yeah that looks kosher
[23:15:33] lawcab: ok
[23:15:37] lawcab: i did try that
[23:15:39] lawcab: and it did work
[23:15:43] lawcab: thank you very much
[23:16:00] lawcab: I used the first one with xpath checker in firefox and it worked
[23:16:06] lawcab: so that was what i tried
[23:16:14] lawcab: i guess i should not trust that
[23:16:15] lawcab: :)
[23:17:26] Dude-X: oh
[23:17:37] Dude-X: firebug xpath with firepath is more reliable
[23:18:03] Dude-X: firefox still supports only xpath 1.0 too

[23:21:01] kalle: is it possible to configure selenium to kill browser that has been inactive for a given amount of time? (context: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=3837)
[23:21:21] kalle: or sessions for that matter
[23:21:34] webtechy: is there any doc for load testing (c#)?

[23:22:39] selbot2: jimevans: note from jarib 36 minutes ago: would be good to have a --host option for the IEDriverServer, right now you can launch it multiple times on the same port (and it will bind to that port on multiple interfaces) 
[23:22:39] selbot2: jimevans: note from jarib 27 minutes ago: hmm, i'm actually not 100% sure it's binding to both interfaces. netstat shows it only listening on 0.0.0.0.:5555, but it does start twice 
[23:23:23] jimevans: jarib: ah. yes… needs idiot-proofing.
