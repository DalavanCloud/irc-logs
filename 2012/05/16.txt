[00:39:00] jleyba: the key codes are correct, but the browser doesn't move the cursor
[00:39:12] jimevans: that blows
[00:40:18] jimevans: of course, i think the test is broken anyway. bot.dom.getAttribute(element, 'value') stubbornly remains null.
[00:41:19] jleyba: you want bot.dom.getProperty
[00:41:45] jleyba: bot.dom.getAttribute and bot.dom.getProperty are literal accessors

[13:10:27] Depado: nirvdrum: Are you sure ? I just don't want selenium to open a new firefox session between each JUnit test.
[13:10:59] nirvdrum: Depado: Well, that's different than what you asked for.
[13:11:09] nirvdrum: In that case, just keep the handle around across tests.
[13:11:25] Depado: Could you explain me that ? I don't get it... 
[13:11:52] Depado: I declared my SeleniumDefault in static but it still open several firefox sessions.
[13:13:31] Depado: And I used a @BeforeClass to open the page I wanted to open. Though it seems to execute that everytime there is a new test.

[14:25:21] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: read the wiki?
[14:25:23] AutomatedTester: :P
[14:25:28] nirvdrum: I was a bit surprised to see the "do you want to remember passwords?" dialog.  Is there a flag to disable all that stuff like RC does?
[14:25:33] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Hush.
[14:26:36] nirvdrum: And I was seeing some issues with the browser firing up, but then not being able to talk to the local server.  It's particularly problematic on IE 7.  IE 6 is so-so.  8 & 9 are fine.  How should I go about debugging that?  I'm happy to help try to track it down.  That code is just mostly foreign to me.
[14:29:35] jimevans: ok, well on a fresh machine, you'll encounter all of those dialogs until you turn them off. i've not done the legwork to figure out every little jot and tittle in the registry to automatically disable them.

[14:32:21] nirvdrum: Huh.  Okay, then I'm not sure how to manipulate the settings :-/
[14:32:30] jimevans: and since you don't have profiles in IE, you can't clean it.

[14:33:19] jimevans: sorry, i don't. most of those settings are set-and-forget. you do it once, then you don't worry about it again.
[14:34:00] jimevans: setting manipulation is usually done through the IE UI, either interactively, or via the options dialog.
[14:34:38] nirvdrum: jimevans: Oh.  So, you mean that's never going to be done programmatically?  So, the only real recourse is documenting in the wiki?
[14:35:20] jimevans: *i'm* not planning on doing it programmatically. if someone wants to do so, i'm happy to look over the code.
[14:35:41] jimevans: frankly, i've got bigger fish to fry.
[14:35:58] nirvdrum: We're on the same team here :-)
[14:36:15] nirvdrum: I'm offering to help.  I just don't want to go off and do something that'll be summarily rejected.
[14:36:52] jimevans: no, that's not what i'm saying. if you want to do the legwork, i'll be happy to look over whatever you come up with. i'm just not taking the initiative to do it myself.
[14:37:39] nirvdrum: That's fine.  But is the lack of registry manipulation an edict or just something you've avoided?  Without that as an option, I'm not sure this is doable.
[14:38:34] jimevans: no, i agree that it's not doable without manipulating the registry. and it's not a hard edict, it's just something i've avoided doing.
[14:38:42] nirvdrum: Gotcha.
[14:39:14] jimevans: i *do* think we'll need to tread carefully before blindly, and without the user's knowledge or permission, changing their registry settings.
[14:39:32] nirvdrum: jimevans: It might be good to have some sort of new capability you'd need to set that acknowledges you're okay with your system settings potentially getting borked.
[14:40:01] jimevans: agreed. that's exactly how i'd propose handling it too.
[14:40:12] nirvdrum: Of course, I'm of the mindset that you shouldn't be using your normal browser for test automation.  But people have constraints.
[14:40:54] jimevans: not to mention brain-dead control-freak IT departments that don't let people control their systems.
[14:44:03] nirvdrum: Cool.  Well, glad we got that worked out.  I was a bit surprised to see my test lock up because I needed to accept some dialog.  I should check for the others.
[14:44:32] nirvdrum: jimevans: Any idea where I should start to look at that socket timeout thing?
[14:47:22] jimevans: so, what's the symptom again?
[14:48:04] nirvdrum: IE 7 starts up and fails to connect to the local socket.  There's some exception about a socket timeout.  This is all RWD.
[14:48:14] nirvdrum: Now the browser is just sitting there, orphaned.
[14:48:26] jimevans: hmm...
[14:48:53] nirvdrum: I assume it's IE talking to the local server.  But I haven't really started debugging yet.
[14:49:16] barancev: ElxRoman: no idea, does not work for me -- FF11, Win7x64
[14:49:20] jimevans: well, actually, the "local server" is out of process for IE.
[14:50:09] jimevans: so you have a .dll which starts up the "local server", or rather an HTTP server. this .dll is what's loaded by the language bindings.
[14:50:49] jimevans: so you had at least one connection to the local server succeed, because the new session command worked.
[14:51:43] jimevans: what's the OS of the machine running IE?
[14:51:58] nirvdrum: Win2k3, IE 7.
[14:52:15] hxmws has joined #selenium
[14:52:44] jimevans: that *should* be okay. the stock firewall in win2k3 isn't as finicky as that in win2k8
[14:52:58] nirvdrum: win2k8 has been working like a charm.
[14:53:19] jimevans: well, that's gratifying.
[14:53:25] nirvdrum: These are configurations I had tuned over the past 2.5 years for Selenium use, albeit with RC.  A lot of the same caveats apply.
[14:55:24] jimevans: you use ruby, right?

[14:58:54] jimevans: you could try it. i don't know if the java bindings implemented a capability to turn on the standalone server.

[15:17:58] llaskin: oh one catch nirvdrum:  https://gist.github.com/556641f948b3cdf8cc38 updated, with how i have over ridden find_element
[15:18:02] nirvdrum: llaskin: Everything is an expression in ruby and each line evaluates to something.
[15:18:13] nirvdrum: You're getting the return value of your iterator, which is the array being iterated on.
[15:18:23] nirvdrum: Is my guess.
[15:18:39] llaskin: but name.find_element should return a single WrappedWebElement shouldn't it?
[15:18:56] llaskin: seeing as find_element returns a single element...not an array?
[15:19:02] nirvdrum: llaskin: If your predicate on line 5 returns true.
[15:19:13] nirvdrum: If not, you have no explicit return statement.
[15:19:26] nirvdrum: And the value of the expression will be `rows`
[15:19:28] llaskin: oh interesting
[15:20:09] nirvdrum: You almost certainly want to rewrite that as a `rows.select` or `rows.find`
[15:20:15] nirvdrum: And drop out the explicit return.
[15:20:19] AutomatedTester: first time in a long time

[15:26:36] selbot2: andreastt: note from santiycr about 16 hours ago: I'm working on a way to let you capture these for the linux failures you reported as well 
[15:27:09] barancev: nirvdrum: you can set useLegacyInternalServer capability, it this case you'll run IEDriver.dll-based driver server
[15:27:16] simonstewart: llaskin: nope
[15:27:23] simonstewart: Just a lot of painfully won experience
[15:27:50] barancev: nirvdrum: otherwise, it will use IEDriverServer.exe (by default, now)
[15:27:58] nirvdrum: barancev: So, if I build the standalone JAR from trunk, do I need to build the IE bindings from trunk as well?
[15:29:09] barancev: nirvdrum: IEDriverServer release cycle is independent, afaik. jimevans: right?
[15:29:49] jimevans: right now, the IEDriverServer release cycle is exactly pegged to the WebDriver release cycle. that is likely to change with the release of 2.22 when the bindings begin using it.
[15:29:56] nirvdrum: barancev: And silly question, but if IEDriverServer isn't installed, do the bindings just fall back to the DLL?
[15:30:26] barancev: nirvdrum: yes, it'll fall back to the dll if there is no exe in the PATH
[15:30:44] nirvdrum: How about that.  I guess I didn't set this up right.
[15:30:58] barancev: (I mean Java binding, don't know about other ones)
[15:31:09] nirvdrum: That certainly explains the messages on the console telling me I need to install the bindings.
[15:31:27] nirvdrum: But then IE went on to dutifully start up, so I thought the message was lying to me.
[15:31:31] jimevans: barancev: that is explicitly *not* the behavior of .NET. we'll throw if the server doesn't exist.
[15:31:59] jimevans: (with an appropriate error message where to download the executable)
[15:32:07] barancev: jimevans: don't we need a transitional period?
[15:32:27] nirvdrum: jimevans: So, I take it the DLL is now abandoned?  Or are you still building it and IEDriverServer just wraps around it?
[15:32:33] barancev: to ont break all the exisint environments after upgrade to 2.22
[15:32:41] jarib: hm. if i want to extend FirefoxDriver to receive some custom capabilities and use them in connectTo(), how would I do it?
[15:32:55] jarib: java's restriction on where you can call this() or super() is kind of inconvenient..
[15:33:03] jimevans: nirvdrum: it's exactly like that. the .exe wraps the .dll. we have to still have the .dll to enable screenshots. :)
[15:33:54] nirvdrum: jimevans: So, what does the separate executable gain us?  Does it multiplex connections or something?
[15:34:09] jimevans: nirvdrum: several things.
[15:34:16] jimevans: makes it vastly easier to debug.
[15:34:29] dawagner: Ugh, to get fasttrack access through American immigration, I need to have an interview in an American airport, *after* going through immigration.  That sucks.
[15:34:41] nirvdrum: Bah.  Just assert(false), let IE crash, and then attach a debugger.  Works like a champ :-P
[15:34:44] jimevans: makes the load/unload semantics of the native code equivalent to process semantics
[15:35:52] jimevans: and thus supports multiple instances of IE in a unified way regardless of language binding.
[15:36:13] jimevans: that's the big win. multiple IE instances for the java language bindings.

[15:45:49] simonstewart: jarib: eh?
[15:46:37] simonstewart: What are you trying to do?
[15:46:37] jarib: may be my java-fu that's lacking. i need to extract a display and port from the capabilities passed to the constructor and use them in connectTo()
[15:47:23] jarib: (i.e. pass that config on to my own ExtensionConnection)
[15:47:50] barancev: simonstewart: and the last question you promiced to think about -- do you have ideas how to enrich webdriver exception with more comprehensive driver info?
[15:48:22] jarib: this would be simple if either getBinary/extractProfile wasn't private, or java didn't have these odd restrictions about where you can call super/this :)
[15:48:48] simonstewart: barancev: not thought much about it yet. Still pondering
[15:48:55] barancev: ok

[15:50:47] jarib: lots of redundant code though.. it's just a small specialization
[15:51:15] simonstewart: So in this case, I'd be tempted to subclass firefoxdriver and override the constructor and connectTo
[15:51:25] jarib: that was my plan
[15:52:03] simonstewart: That's what I'd do
[15:52:20] jarib: but then i lose the stuff in getBinary() (which isn't really important), and extractProfile (which i need)
[15:52:47] jarib: guess i can copy/paste that..
[15:53:11] jarib: or they could be made non-private?

[15:58:34] jarib: no, but users could also pass a profile
[15:58:40] jarib: and i still want that to be used
[15:58:52] simonstewart: Then make them push it into the DesiredCapabilities
[15:59:12] simonstewart: and only provide the single constructor that allows the capabilities
[IRC logfile - Started Wed May 16 16:00:00 2012]
[16:00:00] jarib: yes, users pass it as a capability, and extractProfile() extracts it, no? so if i can't call extractProfile from my constructor, it won't be used
[16:00:15] jarib: or am i missing something
[16:00:19] simonstewart: You're missing something
[16:00:23] simonstewart: :)
[16:00:37] simonstewart: If you override FirefoxDriver(Capabilities) you can still call "super"
[16:00:56] simonstewart: Since you've overridden connectTo() you'll get the unpacked profile
[16:01:04] simonstewart: And you can grab what you want out of the capabilities
[16:01:42] jarib: oO
[16:01:49] simonstewart: ?
[16:02:26] simonstewart: Once you've overridden a single constructor, the parent ones are no longer accessible
[16:02:49] jarib: yeah, sorry
[16:02:50] simonstewart: So if you override FirefoxDriver(Caps) then (eg) the no-arg constructor can no longer be called for your subclass

[16:24:38] Dude-X: would be nice to be able to do END though
[16:24:42] jimevans: AutomatedTester: and even so, the browsers should still respond to the key code, no?

[16:28:46] jimevans: barancev: it returns whatever the atom returns.
[16:29:34] barancev: jimevans: are they (atoms) up-to-date? ShouldReturnTheValueOfTheDisabledAttributeAsFalseIfNotSet says it returns false
[16:29:35] AutomatedTester: wow I am bored of downloading the internet
[16:29:40] jimevans: barancev: sorry. it returns whatever is returned by the browser via the JSON wire protocol
[16:29:55] jimevans: the test may be out of date.
[16:30:00] barancev: I see
[16:30:22] simonstewart: Right.
[16:30:26] simonstewart: Let's try this one again
[16:30:29] jimevans: i haven't audited the java bindings tests to sync up the .net tests
[16:30:35] simonstewart: And reason not to start pushing 2.22 now?
[16:30:58] jimevans: barancev: you can run the .net tests using ./go //dotnet/test/<browser>:run
[16:31:27] nirvdrum: jimevans: So, I'm a bit confused.  One of the first log lines I see when starting up a remote IE session is "INFO - Modifying registry settings ..."  Is that a bad log message then?
[16:31:46] barancev: I'd like IEDriverServer.exe to be implemented in python too, for 2.22
[16:32:05] AutomatedTester: barancev: are you doing the release?
[16:32:16] barancev: nope :)
[16:32:24] AutomatedTester: barancev: it will be done
[16:32:29] AutomatedTester: I have a 1/2 done patch
[16:33:16] jimevans: nirvdrum: i think the java language bindings may modify the registry for setting the proxy. it's not a feature of the native driver code. i make no value judgment as to whether that's a good idea or not.
[16:33:26] nirvdrum: Oh.
[16:33:31] nirvdrum: That makes sense.

[17:01:51] jimevans: darkrift_: element.getAttribute("id") doesn't work?
[17:02:02] jleyba: Maybe I'm abusing the GettingInvolved tag.  I'm using it as a "I have no idea when, if ever, I'll look at this again, so if you want it fixed, you work on it" :)

[17:09:57] darkrift_: first, my bad it's not null, but "", acn that be an issue if the html portion was injected by some ajax calls ?

[17:11:43] darkrift_: using either chrome or firebug to inspect the element DOES have the id

[17:35:28] Dude-X: what was the bug with the xpath?
[17:35:31] Dude-X: i am curous
[17:35:38] darkrift_: shouldn't WebElement.findElements(By.xpath("//something")) search for elements from that web element instead of root ?
[17:36:07] darkrift_: well not a bug with xpath, probably just a misunderstanding
[17:37:45] Dude-X: it SHOULD look from the node of the weblemeent
[17:37:56] Dude-X: maybe you need a . in front of it
[17:39:55] darkrift_: I fixed it with defining ul/li which is the same as the childNodes[1].* which I was iterating over
[17:40:05] darkrift_: but I solved the issue
[17:40:12] darkrift_: thanks for all the help
[17:49:31] jimevans: Dude-X: for the record, webdriver's xpath syntax follows the spec. which means that '//foo' searches from the root of the document, regardless if it's driver.findElement or element.findElement.
[17:49:47] Dude-X: would .// respect current node?
[17:49:59] jimevans: sure. but that's not the same as //

[20:10:53] stackedsax: or write some custom servlets to do some fancier stuff
[20:11:42] stackedsax: not for this problem, but in the future I think spinning up and spinning down VMs on the fly will require a slightly different approach grid-wise
[20:11:54] stackedsax: for this problem, I just need to fix it

[20:15:40] stephend: it's already supported by our IT folks
[20:15:59] stephend: data packets?
[20:16:21] Chopsticks: er not webdriver...geez websockets
[20:16:30] stackedsax: stephend: we use esxi5 and run vcloud on top
[20:16:55] stephend: oh, I'm in QA on the Web side, so no clue about websockets, though my team did test BrowserQuest :-)
[20:17:02] stephend: stackedsax: cool; any best-practices, tips to share?
[20:17:32] Chopsticks: heh, i have been building something on the side, webgl and websockets and for the longest time i couldn't support anyone else but chrome cause i used data packets
[20:17:38] stackedsax: tips?  sure: it's tricky.

[20:17:50] rgenito has joined #selenium
[20:18:14] rgenito: can anyone here actually run a selenium test case using phpunit ?
[20:18:37] Chopsticks: oh ok i got a firefox question
[20:18:41] rgenito: the first error on the stack trace is: #0 [internal function]: PHPUnit_Extensions_SeleniumTestCase_Driver->__call('setTestResultOb...', Array)
[20:19:25] Chopsticks: so i got some old tests running on RC in single window mode for performance reasons
[20:19:55] lukeis: rgenito: it all depends on WHICH php library you are using ;) there are a few...
[20:19:55] Chopsticks: but every time firefox opens up, i get this bar accross the top asking if i would like to improve firefox by sending anonymous information
[20:20:13] Chopsticks: does it pull this from a registry key or what?
[20:20:14] stackedsax: stephend: snapshots, creating windows services… there's a whole ecosystem of stuff I've been working on.  the convo is probably too much typing in irc
[20:20:35] AutomatedTester: Chopsticks: that should be fixed in webdriver
[20:21:23] Chopsticks: well i have the latest release if thats what you mean? or do you mean using webdriver protocol
[20:21:52] lukeis: RC == Selenium interface, WebDriver == WebDriver interface  (in java)
[20:22:04] lukeis: hiya AutomatedTester 
[20:22:07] krosenvold: stackedsax: the jetty threads config might have changed
[20:22:13] AutomatedTester: hi hi lukeis
[20:22:17] Chopsticks: ok, so yeah the tests were written using RC interface, but the nodes are latest release
[20:22:37] AutomatedTester: Chopsticks: its the API that runs it that creates the profile
[20:22:47] Chopsticks: is it something i can fix?
[20:22:50] krosenvold: thread-dump + lsof -P <pid> output
[20:23:14] Chopsticks: you seem to have knowledge, maybe you can help with the original reason i came here
[20:23:25] krosenvold: stackedsax: if you were using a system property to set # threads
[20:23:41] Chopsticks: keep in mind, still using RC interface
[20:23:56] Chopsticks: im trying to setup custom environments
[20:24:04] Chopsticks: like IE7 vs IE9
[20:24:05] AutomatedTester: Chopsticks: use http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/firefox-driver/webdriver.json#40
[20:24:17] AutomatedTester: well the 4 items there in your profile that RC will pickup
[20:24:24] AutomatedTester: the toolkit items
[20:24:47] ner0x has joined #selenium
[20:25:02] Chopsticks: do i set this when i first get an instance back?
[20:25:28] stackedsax: krosenvold: yeah, I added the -DPOOL_MAX=1024
[20:25:38] stackedsax: I thought that was going to be it
[20:25:42] stackedsax: but sadly....
[20:26:12] krosenvold: i think we need to check jetty 7 docs
[20:26:36] stackedsax: oh, it might not be POOL_MAX anymore?
[20:26:38] stackedsax: let me check on that
[20:26:52] stackedsax: I think you may be right
[20:29:06] Chopsticks: is there a way to set that bool without having to use a custom profile?
[20:30:27] lukeis: not really, that's the preferred approach
[20:30:57] Chopsticks: ok, what about the other question, the custom browser strings using the RC interface
[20:31:58] lukeis: what about it? (i don't see your question) but as far as I know you can do that... (i don't though, plus I don't use RC)
[20:32:39] Chopsticks: when i dont specify browsers and use -role rc, i get browsers that say seleniumProtocol=Selenium and Type=Selenium
[20:32:56] Chopsticks: if i specify a custom environment, it says Type=webdriver
[20:33:09] Chopsticks: and then if i try to use that with a RC interface i get an error
[20:33:16] lukeis: how are you specifying them?
[20:33:33] Chopsticks: something like this
[20:33:33] Chopsticks: -browser "browserName=IE9,maxInstances=1"
[20:33:44] Chopsticks: i tried adding type=selenium
[20:33:49] lukeis: are you also saying role rc?
[20:33:53] Chopsticks: but then grid showed type twice
[20:33:55] Chopsticks: yes i am
[20:34:15] rgenito: lukeis: do you mean that it depends on which php *unit* library that i'm using?
[20:34:31] rgenito: i'm really not too sure
[20:34:33] rgenito: ;(
[20:34:51] lukeis: Chopsticks: try using the nodeConfig.json as described on the :wiki Grid2
[20:34:52] selbot2: 1: 03Grid2: gridseleniumwebdriver - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2
[20:35:03] lukeis: rgenito: no, there's multiple Selenium libraries in php
[20:35:54] rgenito: lukeis: do you use one? :)
[20:35:55] Chopsticks: ok i'll try using the json approach
[20:36:06] rgenito: the library i'm using is apparently hosed

[20:36:22] lukeis: rgenito: not regularly... but i have run them just to test the library / sample code out :)
[20:36:31] rgenito: hehe
[20:37:35] Chopsticks: how does role node differ from role RC
[20:38:19] lukeis: rgenito: i would recommend adamgoucher's https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver  (with page objects and other good abstractions https://github.com/Element-34/saunter.php )
[20:38:47] lukeis: that second one looks like RC though
[20:39:17] adamgoucher: and with new client-level debugging tonight or tomorrow!
[20:39:29] lukeis: nice ;)
[20:40:05] adamgoucher: the curl method had an $extra_args thing to set debug level, etc. but that wasnt exposed to the end client. waaay too many places i need to change for that
[20:43:40] Chopsticks: i see, its not type that you must set
[20:43:50] Chopsticks: you must set seleniumProtocol and it will change the type 
[20:44:06] Chopsticks: and if you dont specifiy, it assumes webdriver even if the role used is RC

[20:49:05] jimevans: question about bot.action.click(). does it do element visibility/enabled checks?
[20:50:08] jleyba: it does visible, but not enabled checks
[20:53:31] jimevans: i think i see what i did wrong.
[20:53:32] jimevans: thanks
[20:53:54] rgenito: thanks lukeis
[20:54:02] rgenito: it seems like selenium is just a pure pain in the arse in the PHP world
[20:54:16] lukeis: yup ;)
[20:54:23] rgenito: ...which makes sense, considering selenium does not support PHP
[20:54:35] rgenito: welp, looks like we're using python lol
[20:55:33] lukeis: just a note: just because "SeleniumHQ" is not supporting them, doesn't mean they aren't supported ;)
[20:56:15] lukeis: you should choose the language that the developers know
[20:56:39] lukeis: (qa automaters are developers too)
[20:57:01] Chopsticks: arg.... now if i try and use the new environments, selenium.Type doesn't work
[20:57:37] llaskin: i mean, we even have Haskell support (sorta)
[20:57:37] llaskin: lol
[20:58:11] lukeis: Chopsticks: why don't you switch your nodes to all be webdriver and use WebDriverBackedSelenium
[20:58:35] lukeis: then you'll make progress to using WebDriver (which hopefully you should be trying to do)
[20:58:35] Chopsticks: i worry its gonna break tests
[20:58:43] Chopsticks: i was basically thrown on this
[20:58:46] lukeis: sounds like you're broken anyways ;)
[20:58:51] Chopsticks: because their QA guy left
[20:59:08] Chopsticks: im trying to green up his crappy tests first, then i was gonna port them all to webdriver
[20:59:25] lukeis: that first step may just be futile
[20:59:53] Chopsticks: well i got them mostly good, i mean it was a pain in the ass but they seem okay...
[IRC logfile - Started Wed May 16 21:00:03 2012]
[21:00:03] Chopsticks: but he had such a stupid system
[21:00:21] Chopsticks: he ran test passes for *iexplore and firefox...but his nodes are mixup of ie 7 8 and 9
[21:00:42] lukeis: the next question is going to be are they actually testing things of importance (not just assert page contains "some string") :)
[21:00:44] Chopsticks: so a test failing could be related to running specifically on 7 8 or 9 and the browser version was chosen almost entirely at random
[21:00:48] Chopsticks: thats why im trying to fix that first
[21:00:52] dawagner: andreastt: yt?
[21:01:28] Chopsticks: well i looked over the tests, i think they are testing valid stuff...its just he was too lazy to upgrade to webdriver...probably because he planned to leave
[21:02:03] stackedsax: that is a very valid reason not to do anything
[21:02:22] lduros has joined #selenium
[21:02:34] Chopsticks: so anyways, now i setup an environment for IE9, it is stated as using the selenium protocol
[21:02:48] Chopsticks: when i run a test against it, it redirects, but it cannot type into any forms
[21:03:09] Chopsticks: should i be getting the environment to use *iehta instead of *iexplore?
[21:03:14] Chopsticks: whats the differance between those two?
[21:03:16] lukeis: you're into RC only land... which no one here really does
[21:03:24] Chopsticks: yeah i know, its crusty
[21:03:31] lukeis: RossPatterson might ;)
[21:03:40] lukeis: nm :)
[21:03:42] Chopsticks: im used to webdriver
[21:04:36] Chopsticks: actually i haven't used it in a while, i really hope they have cleaned it up since then, it was pretty aweful
[21:04:37] lukeis: then i would highly recommend to just use webdriverbackedselenium and then just fix the places that breaks
[21:04:59] lukeis: it's come a long way in one year
[21:05:08] Chopsticks: last time i was using webdriver it wasn't scrolling correct amounts so click would always break, hover was a pain in the arse
[21:05:19] lukeis: lot s of those bugs are fixed
[21:05:23] Chopsticks: excellent
[21:05:56] jleyba: if it makes you feel any better, implementing hover is way more difficult than using it in a test :)
[21:06:03] lukeis: heh
[21:06:56] Chopsticks: so anyone know any good articles with a list of the inconsistencies between webdriverbackedselenium and actual seleniumrc? 
[21:07:18] adamgoucher: davehunt|away: sent you something from amo-editors. the same non-sense as before.
[21:09:28] lukeis: Chopsticks: for the most part it just works ;) often stabilizes tests too
[21:10:04] stackedsax: krosenvold: server/src/org/openqa/jetty/util/Pool.java still uses POOL_MAX
[21:10:07] lukeis: it's when people had their own custom js injected that they depended on that it often was tricky
[21:10:16] nirvdrum: jleyba: I pinged you yesterday, but I'm noticing that large response payloads from the Safari driver seem to get dropped.  I'm going to look into it, but if you know off-hand that it's never going to work for whatever reason, I'd appreciate not spending the time working on the impossible.
[21:10:17] stackedsax: to set __max
[21:10:34] Chopsticks: well, he was injecting javascript xpath 
[21:10:45] Chopsticks: i guess to try and help iexplore not suck at that
[21:11:04] lukeis: that's being injected in webdriver already... so you'll not have to do that
[21:11:13] Chopsticks: ok
[21:19:34] jimevans: jleyba: i'm quite looking forward to you getting that working. it means IE synthetic events get that much better. :)
[21:21:33] jleyba: nirvdrum: we basically need to chop up large responses instead of sending a large payload that causes the channel (websocket, or internal extension message) to crap out
[21:22:10] nirvdrum: Can we do chunked responses?
[21:22:32] nirvdrum: I probably should read up more on websockets.
[21:22:43] jleyba: i don't think websockets support it natively
[21:23:02] jleyba: i was thinking of just building it directly into the JSON api the safaridriver uses for messages
[21:23:44] jleyba: start with a "header" message that says how many parts are coming, then send the N parts. on the client, wait until all N parts are received before doing anything
[21:24:23] jleyba: I believe this is mainly and issue for takeScreenshot and getPageSource
[21:24:44] nirvdrum: I ran into it with execute_script, but that's admittedly an odd use case.
[21:25:04] jleyba: yeah, it could happen there to if you return a lot of data (what were you returning?)
[21:25:27] nirvdrum: A serialized copy of the DOM :-P
[21:25:30] davehunt|away: adamgoucher: I'll deal with it
[21:25:43] adamgoucher: davehunt|away: yup. i'm not :D
[21:25:45] jleyba: executeScript is a particularly nasty beast
[21:25:59] jleyba: the script runs in the context of the web page (so js vars resolve as expected)
[21:26:32] jleyba: so the response has to be window.postMessage'd to the injected script for that page
[21:26:49] jleyba: the injected script then has to forward the message to the extension via the tab proxy
[21:26:57] davehunt|away: adamgoucher: So you can relax then :)
[21:27:02] jleyba: and finally, the extension returns it to you on the websocket
[21:27:17] adamgoucher: davehunt|away: who said i wasnt already?
[21:27:23] davehunt|away: adamgoucher: btw I get those emails too
[21:27:31] IvanDM has joined #selenium
[21:28:06] nirvdrum: jleyba: Yeah.  So it looks like it executes just fine, but that the response falls out.  I assumed it was the size of the payload that was problematic.
[21:28:07] adamgoucher: davehunt|away: ah. they are individually sent instead of the all the people in one so wasnt sure
[21:28:22] llaskin: i got no email
[21:28:24] llaskin: i feel unspecial
[21:28:32] davehunt|away: :)
[21:28:48] jleyba: nirvdrum: It is :)  I'm working through the java test suite, fixing bugs as I find them
[21:28:58] jleyba: I'll fix this one when I get to the page source tests
[21:29:01] jarib has joined #selenium
[21:29:12] nirvdrum: Thansk for the info.  I'll look more into it.  But if it's splitting up the wire protocol into chunks, that'll require some larger design work.

[22:16:24] testingb0t1 has joined #selenium
[22:16:47] lukeis: screenshots in phantomJS ... something about my understanding of what PhantomJS is doesn't compute... i thought it was headless, but it can render the page? granted i'm a bit fried right now from work, but that sounds weird.... 
[22:17:10] jleyba: lukeis: phantomjs is built on qt-webkit
[22:17:19] lukeis: ahh
[22:17:28] jleyba: so normally it is pure-headless and doesn't bother rendering the DOM at all (one of the reason it is so fast)
[22:17:36] jleyba: but you can request a screenshot, and it will render to png
[22:17:52] lukeis: that's awesome... i need to start using GhostDriver :-D
[22:28:07] lukeis: kamoricks: redirects shouldn't affect it. what language are you using that you need to do straight wire calls?
[22:30:31] kamoricks: lukeis: PHP.
[22:31:05] lukeis: guess i should have guessed. Does it not have an abstraction to FindElement?
[22:31:54] kamoricks: lukeis: There's no official bindings. I'm using something, yes, but I'm using tcpdump to track the actual calls to make sure it's the call, not the framework.
[22:32:50] lukeis: can you try the same page in python or ruby? ;) just to see (that is if you know any of either of those two languages)
[22:33:24] lukeis: and it's pretty easy to hack the python library for it to dump the posts it does across the wire (and even see the responses)

[22:58:55] lukeis: i don't suppose you can send me a link to the page you're having troubles with or an html snippet?

[23:01:02] kamoricks: lukeis: Unfortunately, no. But I can verify that it has those elements, so http://pastebin.com/77qtKean should be equivilant (broken tags and all).

[23:02:10] selbot2: ok!
[23:02:41] kamoricks: Aha. Remembered to check selenium-server's logs. Here's something that may be of note: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/openqa/selenium/remote/server/handler/BySelector

[23:05:53] lukeis: kamoricks: are you using the selenium-standalone-server?
[23:06:09] kamoricks: lukeis: Yes. And that class is in the JAR. I'm checking the class-file version against my JRE now.
[23:06:14] lukeis: should be started like this:  java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.21.0.jar
[23:06:44] lukeis: ahh, java -version 
[23:06:54] lukeis: hopefully you're on 1.6 at least
[23:07:40] kamoricks: 1.6.0_23, Oracle JDK, x86, hotspot = server. All settings are good, unless it depends on a 64-bit native artifact (which I doubt).
[23:09:36] lukeis: shouldn't
[23:11:04] dawagner: :note andreastt Found it, ignore me :)
[23:11:04] selbot2: ok!
[23:13:54] kamoricks: lukeis: And *here*'s the odd part - extracting the zip and running Main-Class directly works.
[23:14:04] lukeis: zip?
[23:14:19] kamoricks: JAR. ZIP. Same thing.
[23:14:34] lukeis: nope... not entirely ;)
[23:14:39] lukeis: you should be using this http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/detail?name=selenium-server-standalone-2.21.0.jar&can=2&q=#makechanges
[23:14:53] kamoricks: Yes, I am.
[23:15:44] lukeis: can you paste the output from running just "java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.21.0.jar" ?
[23:17:33] kamoricks: ...Which is now working too. So it seems like it was restarting the server that fixed it. Oh joy.
