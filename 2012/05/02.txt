[00:07:05] jarib: jimevans: did you get my last few messages before the netsplit?
[00:07:19] jimevans: which ones?
[00:10:39] jarib: jarib : jimevans: i was thinking more for supporting multiple IEs from the same (client) process. or do you share a single server across driver instances in .NET?
[00:10:42] jarib: jarib : if there's no way of getting the session count
[00:10:44] jarib: jarib : sharing the server may be difficult?
[00:10:47] jarib: jarib : jimevans: i was thinking initially for ruby, use the standalone server if it's found on PATH, otherwise fall back to the in-process server
[00:10:53] jarib: jarib : perhaps with a deprecation warning if it falls back
[00:12:28] jimevans: okay, by default, the .net bindings use a separate server process (on a random port) each time you instantiate the driver. that gives you process isolation between instances and sessions.
[00:12:54] jimevans: this is the same behavior we've had for the chrome driver since introducing its standalone server a year ago.
[00:13:33] jleyba: jimevans: you pinged?
[00:13:35] jimevans: if you want to use a single server process, the recommended approach is to manually start the server, and use RemoteWebDriver.
[00:13:38] sfbrian has joined #selenium
[00:13:51] jimevans: jleyba: i did, but i've forgotten the context now. :)
[00:14:33] jimevans: it was somebody asking something about the safari driver, but i don't remember now.
[00:15:26] jimevans: jarib: in the .net bindings, we'll mark the appropriate constructors of InternetExplorerDriver with an attribute that throws a warning on compilation, telling them this method is obsolete.
[00:16:35] jimevans: so the bottom line is that the client bindings won't share a single server across instances when using the strongly-typed InternetExplorerDriver. if you want that behavior, use RemoteWebDriver.
[00:17:27] jarib: jimevans: right. that's what what i was hoping to do until i found out i can launch multiple servers on the same port
[00:18:03] jimevans: yeah, i just need to fix that. the .net bindings avoid the problem by always specifying the port on the command line.
[00:20:00] jarib: yeah. the ruby logic tries to find the first free port >= 5555
[00:20:48] jarib: so it will use 5555 twice since you bind to another interface than the one i'm checking

[00:54:13] AutomatedTester: no

[01:10:17] santiycr: I do remember you using :http_client to set the client to be used
[01:10:29] santiycr: I'm currently investigating on how to use that to send in a client that will proxy

[02:06:53] dgtlmoon: greets
[02:07:20] dgtlmoon: will the selenium grid/hub run my existing "test suite"'s i have created with the IDE in windows IE+Firefox?
[02:11:28] nirvdrum: Not out-of-the box, no.
[02:11:39] nirvdrum: There's no reason it couldn't.
[02:11:54] nirvdrum: But, you'd need to tell Selenium which browsers to execute in and where the hub is situated.
[02:12:11] dgtlmoon: ok, cool
[02:12:21] dgtlmoon: im a little lost with it, i can run my tests locally in standalone mode just fine
[02:12:31] nirvdrum: Otherwise, grid is happy to run whatever Selenium command you throw at it.
[02:12:55] dgtlmoon: just setting up Grid now
[02:13:09] nirvdrum: There's currently a pretty large cognitive gap there: IDE is more of a beginner-level feature and grid and more an advanced-level one.
[02:13:34] nirvdrum: So, there's been no effort made to have one feed off the other.
[02:13:47] nirvdrum: But, like I said, there's no reason it couldn't.
[02:13:47] dgtlmoon: yes but i have about 120 tests written in the IDE
[02:13:59] dgtlmoon: that my CI server was executing
[02:14:15] dgtlmoon: in standalone mode, now i am trying to get them to run in windows under the grid (which is i think what i want todo)
[02:14:27] dgtlmoon: so my CI server will run the same tests in firefox on linux then IE8 in windows
[02:14:47] dgtlmoon: nirvdrum, yes, so it sounds like i have to connect it somehow
[02:17:05] dgtlmoon: just making sure 'ant' is in my system path etc
[02:21:04] snuff-work: mm.. anyone have issues with selenium running multiple IEs..

[02:53:00] snuff-work: its java..  basically at the end of my code i have a driver.quit()
[02:53:18] snuff-work: which it called from a super class method.. of 'webtest' 
[02:54:11] cMical has joined #selenium
[02:55:02] snuff-work: mm i think i see part of the issue.. you shouldn't have more than 1 instance of IEdriver running
[02:55:35] snuff-work: then question is why does it allow for a possible 5 to be running by default ?
[02:55:45] snuff-work: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver
[02:55:48] snuff-work: (bottom)
[02:56:13] snuff-work: basically i get ghost sessions of IE.. that will die when i stop selenium server
[02:56:36] snuff-work: that stay on one of my pages at random
[02:57:03] snuff-work: timeouts on the webdriver are set to be like 10 secs and 60 secs
[02:58:04] snuff-work: it states 'for some language bindings'  but i've had 3-5 crashes if i try to run 3 or so IE  webdriver sessions at once
[02:58:17] snuff-work: (with a nice java stack trace)
[02:59:59] snuff-work: is there a way to make good use of the 'browserTimeout' feature..  or nodeTimeout..  or do i need to pass something specific for WebDriver instances aka -Dwebdriver.browserTimeout= ?

[18:58:33] santiycr: that means that anyone using IE and getting 2.22 will have to install the IEDriverServer

[19:00:58] santiycr: alright, we'll need an automatically built IEDriverServer before we need to worry about sauce being dynamic enough, I guess
[19:01:00] dawagner: lukeis: I blame simonstewart.
[19:01:06] bsilverberg: I'm testing out Simon's fix for offline Firefox and while it's working, I'm now suddenly getting "fatal: Unable to mark file cpp/IEDriver/Generated/atoms.h" after the test completes. Any ideas what that might be?
[19:01:10] lukeis: dawagner: nice ;)
[19:01:48] santiycr: dawagner: seems like IEDriverServer is not built on CI
[19:02:01] santiycr: which means I don't have to worry about sauce being dynamic enough for now :)
[19:02:10] RossPatterson: dawagner: Maybe jarib can give us a selbot2 shortcut for that :-)
[19:02:21] santiycr: when jimevans builds it by hand, he can let me know and I'll release it by hand in 2 minutes
[19:02:30] dawagner: It's not, we check it in as a prebuild; we can either host the server by HTTP and specify its URL as a capability, or we could ship you a file which has the selenium server jar and IEDriverServer packed together, which you unpack...
[19:02:46] dawagner: Aha, I see :)
[19:03:53] dawagner: bsilverberg: Any idea what process that error is coming from?
[19:04:22] barancev: lukeis: 1) IE crash don't kill your JVM with all the tests, 2) you can select 32 or 64-bit version of IE, 3) I hope we will be able to run multibple IEs on the same machine
[19:04:44] barancev: Dude-X: ^^^^ (sorry, lukeis)
[19:04:54] bsilverberg: I don't see anything about it in build/test_logs. Where else should I look?
[19:05:37] barancev: and, for us, it is easier to debug IE in a separate process and fix bugs
[19:05:37] Dude-X: ah nice, selecting bitness
[19:05:51] dawagner: build/build_log.xml?
[19:06:43] lukeis: bsilverberg: do you run it with debug=true in the command line too? (sometimes that helps)
[19:08:32] bsilverberg: I don't see anything related in build.xml. I will try running with debug=true as per lukeis 
[19:10:13] barancev: well, it's a good question, may be we should make a transitional period to switch to the standalone IE server? how to set it up to make it smooth?
[19:10:37] lukeis: i thought jim had a plan for that
[19:10:51] lukeis: maybe he'll come back online to talk about it ;)

[19:53:56] jimevans: barancev: my initial thought is to let 2.22 remain as is, but announce to the mailing lists that changes will be forthcoming in 2.23. in 2.23, flip the default behavior to expect the standalone server with a deprecation warning. in 2.24, the legacy method is removed

[20:05:24] jarib: AutomatedTester: just need to change the IE driver to look for and use IEDriverServer.exe by default, and fall back to the current in-process approach with a deprecation warning if it's not present

[20:41:41] lukeis: but that will really suck ;)
[20:41:50] ejelinek: Oh, I'm not proud of this either
[20:41:55] jarib: ejelinek: use page_source
[20:41:55] mdgreenfield has left #selenium
[20:42:23] lukeis: and then use his own css parser / matcher?
[20:42:31] lukeis: sounds like a pain...
[20:44:02] jarib: lukeis: yeah, you can pass that string to a validator. a lot less painful than doing anything with WebElements 
[20:44:21] jarib: s/anything/it/ i guess ;)
[20:45:07] lukeis: :) sounds like a pain no matter... and extremely brittle testing... just think when the UI designers revamp the site ;)
[20:45:50] lukeis: almost sounds better to go with an image capture and comparison solution... but i hate those too ;)
[20:46:50] ejelinek: Oh thats what they are going through right now
[20:46:51] jarib: lukeis: huh? a CSS validator won't care if things have changed, just whether it's valid
[20:47:20] ejelinek: but I think I just got them to just consider Webelements that we declare
[20:47:27] ejelinek: and that we can get at easily
[20:47:27] lukeis: jarib: he's thinking of checking css values of elements on the page... not just that css is valid
[20:47:55] ejelinek: right, cause the css has all of the colors etc and our users can change these at a whim
[20:48:03] dawagner: jarib: How can I actually run selbot2 locally?

[20:51:49] jarib: oops
[20:52:02] jarib: lukeis: i think i fixed that
[20:52:23] lukeis: cool
[20:52:36] jarib: ah, i didn't

[21:17:49] jimevans: damn us for publicizing the availability of safaridriver.

[21:18:08] AutomatedTester: kkania: did the Chromium team do a security audit on the ChromeDriver?
[21:19:19] lukeis: jimevans: at least we didn't break their existing safaridriver ;) ... we'll save that for the next release

[22:15:47] dawagner: Is there a handy pythonic way to say "if list contains something for which this predicate is true"? Would """if [x for x in arr if P(x)]:""" get me shot?
[22:16:41] Dude-X: that would always evaluate to true
[22:16:52] Dude-X: let me see
[22:16:58] Dude-X: what you're trying to do ....
[22:16:58] dawagner: No it wouldn't
[22:17:20] Dude-X: so it would give you an empty list sometimes?
[22:17:32] dawagner: if [x for x in [1,2,3] if x > 3]:
[22:17:57] Dude-X: that can work, but I've never seen something written that way....
[22:18:05] dawagner: How would you write it?
[22:19:18] Dude-X: if it's really that short? i may write it in the if the if statement, otherwise
[22:19:37] Dude-X: myList = […]; if myList:
[22:19:38] Moo^: dawagner: I think itertools module has tools for you
[22:19:58] Moo^: any()
[22:20:12] jarib: use ruby: list.any? { |e| p(e) }
[22:20:13] jarib: ;)
[22:20:13] Dude-X: i was also thinking of any
[22:20:19] Dude-X: any(l)

[22:34:09] Dude-X: is that O(N)
[22:34:11] Dude-X: :p
[22:34:26] lukeis: didn't ask for performance ;)
[22:34:47] dawagner: Cunning :)
[22:35:00] dawagner: No reason it couldn't be O(N), if python is clever...
[22:35:28] dawagner: Wait, python basically does no laziness unless explicitly asked for, right?
[22:35:35] dawagner: (I mean, it doesn't matter in this case, but...
[22:35:48] dawagner: In fact, no reason it wouldn't always be O(N)
[22:36:17] Dude-X: when people start using python in a functional manner, it can easily lead to code that is quadratic in time complexity
[22:36:19] dawagner: But number of passes could be at most one, and could be O(N) rather than THETA(N)
[22:36:35] farlan has joined #selenium
[22:36:37] dawagner: Sadface.
[22:37:34] Dude-X: normally you can avoid that by writing clear code and using generators (not chains of map/reduce/filters)
[22:38:06] lukeis: true... but sometimes the time wasted in performance wasn't worth the time to write it the long way ;)
[22:38:27] lukeis: especially if you're not dealing with large datasets :)
[22:39:24] Dude-X: right tool for the right purpose i suppose
