[20:10:39] _kkania has joined #selenium
[20:10:56] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: its the dependency
[20:11:14] AutomatedTester: and either I am too tired to noticed the dependency or I cant find it
[20:11:42] AutomatedTester: I have been burning the candle from both ends this week so could easily be the former
[20:11:58] Dude-X_: alright
[20:12:05] Dude-X_: thanks for tracing the problem
[20:15:22] Dude-X_: does the latest version of java webdriver actually store locator info in the web element object now?
[20:16:49] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: not sure
[20:19:03] Dude-X_: i remember testing it a while back and saw a traceback with webelemnet with string: blah bah 
[20:19:25] Dude-X_: testing a 'dev' release version
[20:21:43] barancev: Dude-X_: yes, it does store
[20:22:05] Dude-X_: can that info be extracted through the API?
[20:23:28] barancev: 1) it's a part of RemoteWebElement implementation, not the WebElement interface
[20:24:18] barancev: 2) no, it's private
[20:25:04] Dude-X_: many of my calls are wrapped, but sometimes i interact with elements only; if i get stateReferenceElement error, I want to be able to use the locator and have it find the element again
[20:26:37] Dude-X_: barancev, does that make sense?
[20:30:03] barancev: Dude-X_: try twice in the wrapper method, it should know the locator
[20:30:30] barancev: or ask simonsteward to extend contract :)
[20:34:10] Dude-X_: well i would have to do a big refactor
[20:34:36] Dude-X_: well maybe it's not so bad
[20:35:29] Dude-X_: but it will take some thoughtâ€¦ it's a good the main work method is private
[20:35:37] AutomatedTester: nice rdio has soft launched in the UK

[20:43:08] Dude-X_: barancev, what happens when a WebElement calls .findElement?
[20:43:27] Dude-X_: does it do a regular driver.findElement?
[20:45:16] friskd has joined #selenium
[20:47:53] barancev: Dude-X_: no, it's findChildElements command in wire protocol
[20:49:25] Dude-X_: so if you have HEAD > BODY > DIV > SPAN, you locate on 'div' then find elements will only find 'span'?
[20:52:40] barancev: yes, it will search in the conext of the parent element
[20:53:23] Dude-X_: that's actually useful
[20:54:59] Dude-X_: i'll try to exploit that for complicated xpaths :D
[20:55:28] barancev: in Java?
[20:55:35] Dude-X_: yeah
[20:55:42] Dude-X_: problem?
[20:56:13] barancev: I'll tell you a trick :)
[20:56:57] barancev: there is a "hidden" ByChained class in org.openqa.selenium.support.pagefactory package
[20:59:29] barancev: you can use it like this: driver.findElement(new ByChained(By.cssSelector("div#id1"), By.xpath("./div/form"), By.name("userfield")))
[IRC logfile - Started Sat May  5 21:00:59 2012]
[21:00:59] barancev: it is roughly equivalent to a chain of findElement calls
[21:01:27] barancev: yes, with some performance penalty
[21:02:44] barancev: but you can use ByChained in findElements that's impossible to make a chain of calls (because it returns a List, not an element)
[21:03:50] barancev: and, yes, it is much better than a complex xpath or css, because: 1) you can mix location strategies, 2) you know what part of your chain is broken, it is easier to debug
