[15:00:39] stephend has joined #selenium
[15:15:22] RossPatterson: jweiss: (Wow, we're talking slowly at each other :-) ) You can't run RC without the built-in HTTP server, it's an integral part of the system.  The scripts and browsers communicate to each other through it.
[15:16:07] jweiss: RossPatterson: hm, i was thinking those string commands that the client sends over HTTP, i would expect some class receives those strings.
[15:17:37] RossPatterson: You coulds certainly write an in-process combo-client-and-server, but the Selenium Core component that runs inside the browsers still wants to connect to an HTTP server to ask "what should I do next?".
[15:17:39] jweiss: RossPatterson: so if i *must* run http, can i at least get a jar file with just the server?
[15:18:10] RossPatterson: Sure: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/detail?name=selenium-server-standalone-2.21.0.jar&can=2&q=
[15:18:29] jweiss: RossPatterson: that's not just the server, it also includes all of webdriver client classes doesn't it?

[20:13:38] nirvdrum: barancev: I'd have to double-check.  SelfRegisteringRemote was a Grid 1 thing.
[20:13:45] nirvdrum: The class name may have carried over.
[20:13:57] nirvdrum: But, it's basically what allows the remote node to register with the hub.
[20:14:33] nirvdrum: Grid could use some cleanup for sure.  But, before you go digging around, let me know.  There's some stuff that can't or shouldn't be changed freely.

[20:15:50] nirvdrum: The macro memory gets screwed up a bit, but I rarely use that anyway.

[20:17:11] nirvdrum: barancev: The interfaces are mid-cleanup.
[20:17:22] nirvdrum: barancev: And some of that is deceptive because there's a bunch of reflection.
[20:17:51] barancev: yes, lots of reflection

[20:20:32] nirvdrum: I view convincing other people to work on grid to be my greatest accomplishment in this project.

[20:22:05] barancev: nirvdrum: I'm close to this as I'm building a new grid netword at the moment, and hit all these bugs :)
[20:22:29] nirvdrum: It's debatable whether the platform thing is really a bug.
[20:22:40] nirvdrum: I think it's weird that the IE driver auto-inserts a platform, personally.
[20:22:53] nirvdrum: But, we're obviously not going to change that.
[20:26:15] barancev: yes, may be it is a client-side issue
[20:26:30] barancev: are we going to support IE on Mac, somewhere?

[22:48:58] testingb0t1 has joined #selenium
[22:48:59] nimeacuerdo: which has the effect of stopping (=destroying) the embedded http server that runs in the DLL
[22:49:02] nimeacuerdo: side
[22:49:58] jimevans: nimeacuerdo: that's why a move to the standalone ie driver server was just implemented. to unify the semantics of the IE driver.
[22:51:20] nimeacuerdo: but will that change the current behavior?
[22:51:49] nimeacuerdo: if the embedded mongoose server is asked to stop when a test calls quit
[22:52:01] nimeacuerdo: which is what I'm seeing now
[22:52:09] nimeacuerdo: any stale browser instance
[22:52:17] nimeacuerdo: cannot be recovered by the SessionsCleaner
[22:52:17] jimevans: yes, because it'll be in a separate process.
[22:52:35] jimevans: or, by default it will be.
[22:53:33] jimevans: what *should* happen now, if you're using the default IE driver in java (after the change to use the standalone server) is that each instance of IE should get it's own server process launching.
[22:53:56] jimevans: so when a driver instance calls .quit(), only that process goes away.
[22:54:15] jimevans: of course, i didn't implement the java bindings, so i may be completely full of it, too.
[22:54:20] nimeacuerdo: hum
[22:54:32] nimeacuerdo: I'm using PHP bindings
[22:54:57] jimevans: the PHP bindings require the remote server, no?
[22:55:24] sassda has left #selenium
[22:56:25] nimeacuerdo: they do all their stuff through curl against the java server instance (the standalone jar I mean)
[22:56:57] jimevans: then at the remote end, you're using the java language bindings.
[22:58:04] nimeacuerdo: the InternetExplorerDriver and InternetExplorerDriverServer java classes, among others, as the debugging session has confirmed
[22:58:23] nimeacuerdo: which in turn communicate with the mongoose http server
[22:58:36] nimeacuerdo: of the C++ side
[22:59:01] nimeacuerdo: of which
[22:59:08] nimeacuerdo: there is only one instance running
[22:59:17] nimeacuerdo: the java side does not start more than one
[22:59:27] jimevans: you're missing the point.
[IRC logfile - Started Thu May 17 23:00:08 2012]
[23:00:08] nimeacuerdo: at which part in particular?
[23:00:18] jimevans: a change was recently made that implemented using the standalone IE server in the java bindings, if present.
[23:00:45] nimeacuerdo: I'm using 2.21
[23:00:49] jimevans: (if it's not present, it falls back to using the embedded DLL, which is a choice i strongly disagree with, but i stay out of the java bindings as a rule)
[23:00:58] jimevans: right. this change is post-2.21
[23:01:11] nimeacuerdo: oook...
[23:01:33] jimevans: the point i'm making is that if you were using the latest code, along with the standalone IE driver server, you would not encounter the problem
[23:01:58] nimeacuerdo: I'll try with the latest code then
[23:02:01] jimevans: because each IE driver session would, by default, get its own instance of the IEDriverServer.exe process
[23:02:08] nimeacuerdo: I see
[23:02:12] jimevans: and it would be isolated in that process.
[23:02:37] nimeacuerdo: is there any additional setup to do in order to enable that behavior?
[23:02:43] jimevans: when the driver instance called .quit(), the session would only affect that particular IEDrvierServer.exe process.
[23:02:59] brettporter has joined #selenium
[23:03:08] jimevans: you'd need the IEDriverServer.exe, which can be downloaded from the downloads page.
[23:03:12] nimeacuerdo: a jam, a server-instance-per-session would not have this problem
[23:03:21] nimeacuerdo: ok
[23:03:43] nimeacuerdo: and then something like the param used to specify the chrome driver
[23:03:49] nimeacuerdo: the path
[23:03:53] jimevans: right.
[23:03:53] nimeacuerdo: ?
[23:03:58] nimeacuerdo: ok
[23:04:21] jimevans: again, i don't know exactly what barancev did in his implementation of this functionality.
[23:04:27] jimevans: i'd have to look at the code.
[23:05:18] nimeacuerdo: I was working locally against the tag for 2.21 so maybe there's something new in there I'm missing too
[23:05:36] jimevans: no, all of these changes went in just this week.
[23:05:37] nimeacuerdo: fair enough, I'll grab the latest code and test what happens
[23:05:50] nimeacuerdo: cool
[23:06:03] nimeacuerdo: thx a lot Jim
[23:06:07] jimevans: no problem.
[23:06:27] jimevans: incidentally, you're right, the java bindings implementation of the native code interaction is broken.
[23:06:31] jimevans: and it has been for some time.
[23:07:20] jimevans: the ruby and .net bindings had the canonical implementation, which required checking the count of open sessions before quitting the mongoose server.
[23:07:43] nimeacuerdo: that's exactly what I was thinking to patch :)
[23:07:55] nimeacuerdo: which I hope won't be necessary now
[23:08:08] AutomatedTester: python is broken too
[23:08:24] AutomatedTester: since we only monitor the the initialization
[23:09:02] jimevans: that's the idea behind using the standalone server. it unifies the semantics to use process semantics, which is much more uniformly defined among different languages.
[23:09:16] jimevans: i touched on this briefly in my talk at seconf.
[23:09:56] nimeacuerdo: A workmate attended your talk while I was on track B…..
[23:10:11] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I slept through your talk
