[00:49:02] warreng: if i have a single chromedriver running multiple sessions (dozens) in a headless window (Xvfb), can all of those sessions be used in parallel? or are they essentially synchronous and one browser won't do anything until the next finishes?
[00:50:01] ian_mac has joined #selenium
[00:50:49] dawagner: warreng: You can run them in parallel all you want :)
[00:50:56] dawagner: The limit is your machine's hardware
[00:52:00] warreng: if i want 50 browsers, are there any advantages to running 50 Xvfbs, 50 chromedrivers and 50 chrome instances (i.e. 1 chrome, 1 chromedriver and 1 Xvfb) versus 1 Xvfb, 1 chromedriver and 50 instances?
[00:53:44] dawagner: I'd experiment with your hardware, I don't know where the bottlenecks will be
[00:54:27] dawagner: I tend to share one virtual display unless tests are actively interacting badly, and I've never seen Chrome have shared-display problems
[00:55:25] dawagner: One ChromeDriver is probably cheaper than many chromedrivers
[00:55:40] dawagner: But you may run in to contention somewhere :)

[01:11:39] dawagner: I'll try whacking a big pile of instrumentation at the server side, and seeing what happens... Unfortunately, it seems to take a whole test run to get one failing case...
[01:14:10] dawagner: :note santiycr It looks like something like 1/40 VMs you pull up can't connect to our HTTP server.  Could we commandeer a box from you to to play with, to work out whether the problem is my end, your end, or the middle?

[04:27:37] islands: hello, i am using selenium server 2.21 on ubuntu with phpunit.  taking the example of a login form, the only way i can get it to work is using the native php sleep function.  all calls to clickAndWait, waitForPageToLoad, openAndWait have no effect.  i also set setWaitForPageToLoad(true) but no effect.  any other ideas to try?  
[04:28:20] islands: without the sleep function, subsequent calls are done on the login page, not the redirected page.
[04:28:40] islands: if i do add the sleep function with, say, 5 seconds, it gives selenium enough time for the new page to load before moving on
[04:28:45] islands: thanks

[08:45:22] barancev: i'
[08:45:50] Depado: I already tried to put the annotations @AfterClass and @BeforeClass
[08:46:20] barancev: and you have to use JUnit 4 test runner, too
[08:46:25] Depado: And I got JUnit 4.10
[08:46:35] Depado: How to use that ? ._.
[08:48:39] barancev: remote 'extends TestCase'
[08:49:21] barancev: add annotations
[08:49:47] barancev: and try to run -- it'll show you if you're using JUnit 4 or not
[08:50:22] Depado: Okay =)
[08:51:20] barancev: don't forget to add @Test annotation, too

[11:55:10] dawagner: AutomatedTester: That happens when they download a new version, which is "some time after a version is released"

[12:05:19] barancev: or do you have other ideas? you promised to think this out
[12:06:27] simonstewart: I promised, but haven't yet
[12:07:21] barancev: are you still against my siggestion (add runtime driver type in ErrorHandler when we throw an exception)
[12:07:24] barancev: ?
[12:07:37] barancev: and extract it from the trace if it is not set
[12:07:41] simonstewart: I'm strongly against making an IPC
[12:07:44] barancev: from the stacktrace
[12:07:50] simonstewart: stacktrace would be best
[12:08:57] barancev: IPC? what IPC? ErrorHandler creates a new exception object and adds a string to it -- the driver runtime type (not the link to the driver!)
[12:09:17] simonstewart: sure
[12:09:29] simonstewart: I'm not really in a good place to talk about this
[12:09:36] simonstewart: I've got about three things going on at the same time
[12:09:38] barancev: ok, later
[12:09:41] simonstewart: And I want to concentrate
[12:09:44] simonstewart: Thanks

[12:10:02] hxmws: is it possible to retrieve 3rd party cookies when using webdriver? i've tried @browser.manage.all_cookies
[12:10:19] simonstewart: only the currently visible cookies
[12:12:42] hxmws: simonstewart, thanks for the quick response. when you say only currently visible does that mean that 3rd party cookies should be available if they are loaded in the page

[12:27:44] foolx: Hi guys! 
[12:28:30] foolx: i have a little Problem, maybe someone can help me? I got an Element with div ID, that contains stuff i want to catch.
[12:29:00] foolx: Is there any way of getting selenium to return some values for every element that is inside that div?
[12:29:34] jimevans: AutomatedTester: do the python bindings expose the page load timeout?
[12:30:40] AutomatedTester: jimevans: um dont think so
[12:31:25] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I havent done it
[12:31:41] jimevans: ok. thanks
[12:31:58] AutomatedTester: how come/
[12:35:28] AutomatedTester: I am off
[12:35:30] AutomatedTester: laters guys
[12:35:57] foolx: i pasted the DIV i want to analyse: http://pastebin.com/KDw1zv4i
[12:36:23] AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
[12:37:10] jimevans: dawagner: would it make it any easier if the IE standalone server were checked into prebuilts? It's no longer being released on the same schedule as the rest of the library.
[12:38:41] foolx: repasted and croped out unneeded stuff (i think!) -> http://pastebin.com/bre5Mcbh
[12:40:03] foolx: its a div with id "rahmenContent" inside there are several divs (class="fliesstext" or "fliesstext_aktiv")
[12:40:12] barancev: jimevans: IEDriver.dll is built into server statically, so we have to update sever at the same time ass the dll, no?
[12:40:46] simonstewart: For now, can't we run the IE tests with the magic turned on for the static DLL?
[12:40:57] dawagner: jimevans: Yes, it would make it a lot easier [I checked one in so I could experiment, but I'm willing to remove it if we have a better answer :)]
[12:41:12] foolx: I would like to get the internal information out of there for every one of those. Searching for class="ServerDesc","serverStatus","serverRecommended" and a way to get the correct button for each
[12:41:50] jimevans: barancev: you can't build the .exe without building the .dll, and the .exe embeds the .dll. eventually, we should delete the .dll altogether, and only supply the .exe.
[12:42:38] jimevans: simonstewart: we could, but it's a matter of setting a capability in the driver used by sauce, which is the same magnitude of code change as telling sauce where to get the standalone server.
[12:42:57] jimevans: dawagner: then we'll just start checking into the prebuilt directory.
[12:43:36] jimevans: i don't really care either way. the important bit is remembering to update the resource script so that the version reported on the console is correct.
[12:44:47] barancev: what we really should think about is how to run debug server is sauce
[12:44:54] barancev: to avoid connection issues
[12:45:24] barancev: and to make tests faster
[12:54:09] jimevans: way-hay! i just noticed IE 7-9 javascript tests are green! w00t!
[12:54:30] testingb0t1 has joined #selenium
[12:54:55] simonstewart: woot!
[12:55:28] dawagner: jimevans: As of the next build, the IE tests should be using the exe
[12:55:36] dawagner: Which will be as soon as these builds finish, and I restart the CI server
[12:56:05] jimevans: dawagner: they should be using *which* .exe? they've already been using the one that santiycr downloaded internally to sauce.
[12:56:17] jimevans: you can see that in the logs
[12:56:19] dawagner: The one currently checked in to the prebuilds dir
[12:56:25] jimevans: groovy.
[12:56:47] jimevans: that'll help the pass rate of the IE java tests too, as long as they can connect back to the test web server.
[12:56:51] dawagner: Yep
[12:57:44] jimevans: it seems to me that's the cause of the large part of flakiness, that the browser on the sauce vm seems to occasionally have difficulty connecting back to the test web server (which is hosted on illicitonion.com).
[12:57:57] dawagner: Yeah
[12:58:09] dawagner: It's actually not hosted on illicitonion.com, that's just convenient DNS I have acess to
[12:58:19] dawagner: I'm hoping to debug that with Santi this afternoon :)
[12:58:19] simonstewart: We could always host the test web server on a google appengine site
[12:58:23] simonstewart: Those things are stable
[12:58:27] simonstewart: And always available
[12:58:32] simonstewart: And it's easy to serve static content
[12:58:46] jimevans: simonstewart: but it's not all static content.
[12:59:25] *jimevans is thinking about the tests that call directly into a servlet like the page load timeout tests.

[13:09:07] foolx: okay, very easy question: how can i get this "List<WebElement> allInstances = driver.findElements(By.id("instance_0"));" to work for instance_0/1/2/3/n? -> Or: How can i use a wildcard inside a findElements command?

[13:25:11] ElxRoman: foolx: I forgot quotes
[13:25:26] foolx: ElxRoman: not really, i should saw that.. ;)
[13:26:58] ElxRoman: foolx: than i think there is no best ways to do this...
[13:27:48] foolx: ElxRoman: but he still doesn't find what he should find. There are 4 ids he should find (instance_0 ... instance_3) instead he is returning nothing
[13:29:45] ElxRoman: foolx: hm...

[16:46:52] foolx: Dude-X: but then i will just find any element where my searchstring is valid. my searchstring is unique, but the nextnext div contains a link that i would need
[16:47:03] foolx: and that link is not unique ;(

[17:14:31] lukeis: ok, now which elements do you want?
[17:15:18] foolx: i have to login onto each of those "instancePlay" classes, but i can't simply use webelements, but have to find the one element that equals a given string in class "serverDesc"
[17:15:47] stephend_ has joined #selenium
[17:16:38] foolx: my first idea was to find the element containing the given string (example: Germany 1) and then the third sibling -> but that doesn't work
[17:17:14] Dude-X: foolx: just a snippet of the html as it appears in firebug (but not the actual html source since that is usually formatted in a dfferent way)
[17:17:53] Dude-X: you can do driver.findElement('x').findElement('div/div')
[17:18:11] foolx: simple like that? @('div/div')?
[17:18:23] foolx: i am back in a sec (*goes testing*
[17:18:25] Dude-X: well that's pseudocode
[17:18:32] Dude-X: but you should use the proper locator
[17:18:39] lukeis: heh
[17:19:55] foolx: mhmm, okay, so i should be able to search inside my already found element?
[17:20:11] foolx: i am starting with this: WebElement webElement = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[@class='serverDesc' and text()='" + element + "'][3]"));
[17:20:20] foolx: WebElement webElement = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[@class='serverDesc' and text()='" + element + "']"));
[17:20:31] foolx: (not with [3], that didn't work)
[17:20:33] Dude-X: yes, given a webelement, calling findElement will only search the current node, and it's subchildren
[17:20:57] foolx: Dude-X, so it can't find siblings right?
[17:21:07] Dude-X: nopw
[17:21:23] Dude-X: there's an xpath command to locate siblings
[17:21:25] foolx: damn, because the only unique stuff i find, is a sibling of the link i am searching
[17:21:40] lukeis: foolx: List<String>links = new ArrayList<String(); for (WebElement link : driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(".instancePlay a")) { links.add(link.getAttribute("href"); };  for (String link : links) { driver.get(link);  ...test the link.... }
[17:21:40] Dude-X: but you should paste the html source as printed by an inspector like firebug
[17:21:55] Dude-X: note he uses findElementS
[17:23:33] Spanktar has joined #selenium
[17:23:35] foolx: @Dude-X: I did, but i am unsure which inspector i use ;) But i had to extract a part of the source shown by the inspector
[17:23:45] foolx: @lukeis: looks nice, will try that now
[17:24:29] Dude-X: don't you use firebug, or chrome inspector, or IE inspector?
[17:25:22] foolx: im using chrome, but i don't know whats the inspector called there
[17:25:31] lukeis: it's installed by default ;)
[17:25:38] lukeis: right click... inspect element
[17:25:47] Dude-X: it's the built in inspector
[17:26:00] Dude-X: firefox 11+ has one a built in one too
[17:26:02] foolx: then i am using that one ;)
[17:26:05] Dude-X: but i prefer firebug
[17:26:31] lukeis: the built in firefox one doesn't do all the things that chrome/safari inspector and firebug do...
[17:27:02] lukeis: which makes me wonder why mozilla even released it ;)
[17:27:43] Dude-X: it's good for a quick and dirty inspection

[17:30:14] lukeis: if you say 4, i'll believe you :_
[17:30:15] lukeis: :)
[17:30:27] RossPatterson: Dude-X, foolx: " given a webelement, calling findElement will only search the current node, and it's subchildren" is only *mostly* correct.  In particular, element.findElement(By.xpath("//...")) will find anything in the page.  I still think it's wrong, but it's documented.
[17:30:43] foolx: right, for this example, there are 4. but how can i assure, just to click the one, that is the sibling of mine server?
[17:30:53] Dude-X: RossPatterson: i get conflicting points of view about this
[17:31:14] Dude-X: but that does makes sense
[17:31:24] lukeis: foolx: ohh, you only want "Germany 1" ?
[17:31:52] RossPatterson: My point of view is by definition correct :-)
[17:32:03] foolx: thats the problem, i not want only "Germany 1" (that would be easy), but i want the link next to the ServerDesc which text is like a string 
[17:32:19] davehunt has joined #selenium
[17:32:44] foolx: when the class is called with element = "Germany 1", i want the link next to "germany 1", when it is called with "USA 1" i want just that link.

[18:43:40] Dude-X: how does grid know to fire up a new instance of firefox?
[18:44:59] Dude-X: does each test have to call new  remoteWebdriver?
[18:46:30] barancev: Dude-X: node creates a new FirefoxDriver instance on the request
[18:46:58] Dude-X: barancev: so does that mean each test have to call new driver?
[18:47:40] Siph0n has joined #selenium
[18:47:40] barancev: do you want a new driver? or do you want to reuse?
[18:47:45] Dude-X: currently i have junit spawn a single driver, and all tests from that single instance; i'm looking into how to parallelize my tests, and use remote web driver with grid 2.0
[18:48:31] barancev: using grid is like running several drivers locally
[18:48:56] barancev: (from the test coding point of view)
[18:49:04] Dude-X: so I do have to create new instances of drivers
[18:49:20] barancev: you run several tests in parallel, they use different RemoteWebDriver instances
[18:49:47] barancev: each one governs a remote browser
[18:50:03] Dude-X: okay that's an important part of the puzzle; initially i assumed that if i can get junit to run the tests in parallel, then each test will talk to the same driver
[18:50:19] Dude-X: but that raised the question, how would the hub know to spawn a new instance?
[18:50:32] Siph0n: Any reason u are using junit over Testng?

[18:52:02] barancev: Dude-X: or jython
[18:52:30] Siph0n: Than make sure your page objects know which driver to use.

[18:53:31] barancev: why? it's almost Java :)
[18:54:10] Dude-X: Siph0n: bottom line for me is that if i do get junit to run tests in parallel i'd have to change the driver instantiation code so that each "thread" instantiates their own copy
[18:54:16] Dude-X: currenlty driver is a singleton :O
[18:54:46] barancev: yes, get rid of singletons to do parallelization
[18:55:40] dmachi has joined #selenium
[18:55:52] Siph0n: Yup :) but even if u do have 10 different drivers for 10 different tests, are u already passing the driver instance to the page object? That is if u use page objects.
[18:56:41] Dude-X: i don't use the PageObject thingie in webdriver, but i do have page objects
[18:56:51] Dude-X: as a general design pattern
[18:57:13] Siph0n: Yea same here.
[18:58:07] Dude-X: i do have a crude parallelization technique where i spawn 2-4 jvms

[18:59:37] lukeis: Dude-X: i pool my drivers to run in parallel (locally the size is 3, but when run in grid mode it's much higher... but also grid does the pooling for you... it blocks the instantiation until it can give you an instance)

[19:00:57] Dude-X: oh i see
[19:01:40] Dude-X: i think i'll stick with my crude parallelization where I spawn 4 processes of the same tests but assigned different tests (and webservers)
[19:01:59] Dude-X: this actually works well since i don't have to worry about concurrency issues on the webserver side
[19:02:30] lukeis: heh ;) when you want real parallelization you'll have to think about it

[19:03:29] Dude-X: we used to use maven on this project but switched to ivy
[19:03:59] Dude-X: i thought maven only managed the dependencies of jars
[19:04:14] Dude-X: does it also double duty as a script framework
[19:04:16] lukeis: also helps you launch your build
[19:04:30] Dude-X: interesting
[19:04:40] lukeis: there's plugins
[19:04:55] lukeis: surefire ;)  ~ to launch your tests

[20:02:19] lukeis: jimevans: so... the guy gave no conetext in his thread *until now* about setting the page load timeout... i want to smack him
[20:09:21] jimevans: so the real questions are: if you set a page load timeout, and you load a new page via executing WebElement.click() on a link that loads a new page, and the loading page would take a long time to "completely load", (1) does the page load timeout trigger the TimeoutException on the new page, and (2) what does the *next* command, say findElement() do?
[20:12:45] dmachi has joined #selenium
[20:12:50] lukeis: i would say the .click() should throw the timeout exception
[20:13:17] lukeis: does it not? i would actually expect it to

[20:16:09] lukeis: click is not async
[20:16:10] barancev: the only situaltion it's not async that I know of are modal windows
[20:16:24] lukeis: click blocks until the next page is loaded
[20:16:48] barancev: lukeis: no it does not
[20:16:53] lukeis: yes it does ;)
[20:17:13] lukeis: what browser? 
[20:17:21] *lukeis mainly uses FF and Chrome
[20:17:41] jimevans: lukeis: umm, not really. we make a "best effort" to make it that way, but I can tell you for certain IE can't guarantee synchronicity after an element click.
[20:18:11] jimevans: not with native events, anyway.
[20:18:13] lukeis: yes, so for clicking on javascripty links it doesn't... but normal <a href="..."> it does
[20:18:47] lukeis: i would have soooo many broken tests if click did not wait for the next page to load
[20:19:06] lukeis: and for the cases it does not wait, i add my own waits
[20:19:11] jimevans: lukeis: no, IE has a race condition that it is possible for the driver to lose for regular <a href='…'> links.
[20:19:30] lukeis: ok, then i'm glad i don't really use IE ;)
[20:19:44] jimevans: note that it doesn't lose them very often, but it *can* lose them.
[20:20:15] jimevans: and that's rather the point of the explicit waits, that clicks are async.

[20:20:37] selbot2: Elastica - Waking Up - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlOje4ly4hg&feature=youtube_gdata
[20:20:50] lukeis: i thought the point was that because sometimes they are async the waits came to exist ;)
[20:21:27] barancev: the waits come to exist because of ajax :)
[20:21:28] jimevans: from the javadocs: "If click() causes a new page to be loaded via an event or is done by sending a native event then the method will *not* wait for it to be loaded and the caller should verify that a new page has been loaded. "
[20:22:07] lukeis: that's not an accurate statement then
[20:22:15] lukeis: chrome uses native events (always) and click blocks
[20:22:30] jimevans: of course, this is immediately after the sentence that says click "will attempt to block until the page has loaded"
[20:23:10] lukeis: heh ;)
[20:23:19] jimevans: can you point me to the chromedriver code where they're sending native events? i'd like to steal some of their code.
[20:23:48] lukeis: i don't know the source well enough to point
[20:24:05] jimevans: last time i looked, they were synthesizing all events.
[20:24:22] jimevans: and by synthesizing, i mean "not using OS-level event mechanisms"
[20:24:36] jimevans: but it's been a long time since I looked.
[20:24:54] lukeis: they might not be using OS level... maybe just application level ;)
[20:24:57] jimevans: and that codebase has changed a ton.
[20:25:26] *lukeis is talking out of my ass now, cause i don't know that code
[20:25:38] jimevans: so the definition of "native events" it seems is somewhat flexible. :)
[20:28:21] dmachi has joined #selenium
[20:31:02] lukeis: so... back to the original question with aysnc clicking in mind... i still think only .click() should throw the exception and the next find element needs to have a wait added to it by the user /cc jimevans 
[20:31:30] lukeis: oh
[20:31:31] llaskin: :ci status
[20:31:32] selbot2: 18 building | 9 successful | 5 unstable | 0 failing | 1 aborted
[20:32:06] lukeis: so the user is basically screwed if they click a link that ends up being async and the following page takes forever to load
[20:32:25] jimevans: that's the guy's point, i think.
[20:32:33] lukeis: not really conveyed
[20:32:47] lukeis: but in that case the wait should timeout
[20:33:07] lukeis: if it really is a unique selector to the new page and not the old page (which he has yet to demonstrate)
[20:33:10] dawagner: jimevans, lukeis: Can you tl;dr me the discussion?
[20:33:36] lukeis: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/selenium-users/yV2AEZlvU_8/DzCrYLUnk54J
[20:33:39] jimevans: i've got a meeting.
[20:35:10] jimevans: dawagner: bottom line, though is set a page load timeout, then get to a new page by clicking on a link (<a href='…'>). user claims that the page will wait indefinitely in some cases.

[22:45:19] Dude-X_: barancev, do you disable compatibility mode for intranets under IE?

[22:48:09] barancev: 1) compatibility mode - fail, IE mode - fail, IE8 mode - fail, IE9 mode - OK
[22:48:22] dmachi has joined #selenium
[22:48:25] barancev: compatibility mode - fail, IE7 mode - fail, IE8 mode - fail, IE9 mode - OK
[22:48:50] jimevans: barancev: what does it do on *actual* IE7/8?
[22:48:56] barancev: by default my browser starts in compatibility mode, and the test fails
[22:49:12] Dude-X_: uncheck enable CM for intranet
[22:49:28] barancev: don't know yet, I'm trying to make tests green in IE9 first
[22:49:52] barancev: jimevans: in what document mode should they pass?
[22:49:59] jimevans: i'd be far less worried about that that making it work on the actual browser.
[22:50:16] jimevans: barancev: don't know. frankly don't care at this point. i'm just too discouraged.
[22:51:25] jimevans: i'm going home. good luck everybody. i might be back on tuesday, i might not.
[22:51:28] jimevans has left #selenium
[22:51:56] Dude-X_: one problem i have at work is when testing our local web app with IE from a computer with a fresh install is that it will default to Comp. mode; this is wrong because our site is coded to use the proper code for IE7, and 8; by default IE is set to always use CM when on the same intranet; so if my default domain name is CompanyX.com, then anything at companyX.com is always going to use CM mode and in some cases get rendered incorrectly
[22:52:58] barancev: Dude-X_: where is this option?
[22:53:00] Dude-X_: we have to go into Compatiblilty View Settings and disable the intranet setting; it makes sense for large corps that use custom ActiveX intranets, but sucks for testing
[22:53:22] Dude-X_: press ALT on the keyboard, select the last thing on the menu, look for Compatiblity View Settings
[22:53:28] Dude-X_: it's the first checkbox among 3 choices
[22:55:22] barancev: aha! localhost is in the list of the sites to use compatibility mode
[22:56:15] Dude-X_: that qualifies as intranet
