[05:32:41] idahoev: having trouble after upgrading from 2.16 to 2.21:   all clicks that pop a confirmation dialog are triggering an exception "Modal dialog present".   
[05:33:07] idahoev: The next line of my test code switches to the dialog and accepts the dialog,  but it's never getting there because the exception is getting thrown right after clicking the link.
[05:37:11] idahoev: paste of the issue:  http://pastie.org/3959242

[05:53:11] lukeis has joined #selenium
[05:53:39] lukeis: idahoev: looks like that's been fixed in a newer version of capybara
[05:54:03] dmachi1 has joined #selenium
[05:54:48] idahoev: lukeis: maybe a non-released one?   I have the most recent release (1.1.2) installed
[05:55:05] lukeis: the resynchronize has been removed from selenium/node.rb
[05:56:02] lukeis: (4 months ago) ... which is newer than the latest release apparently
[05:56:34] idahoev: ah.   so maybe if I use a git version
[05:56:36] idahoev: grrr
[05:56:49] lukeis: or ping Jonas to push a new release
[05:57:32] idahoev: i will probably do so.   will at least check the git version though; want to make sure these tests pass since the client is waiting on a deploy tonight
[05:57:46] lukeis: gotta love that ;)
[05:58:19] idahoev: (FF upgraded itself which necessitated the selenium upgrade, which broke half the specs.   I could downgrade FF, but that will only last until someone else on the team upgrades FF...)
[05:59:29] lukeis: ah, then you're really going to want selenium 2.22 if / when we actually release (since native events don't really work well with 2.21 and FF12)
[IRC logfile - Started Thu May 24 06:00:15 2012]
[06:00:15] idahoev: heh
[06:00:39] lukeis: or disable native events... but i don't know enough about capybara to tell you how to do that
[06:01:26] idahoev: fingers crossed I won't run into it
[06:03:03] idahoev: in semi-related news, I downgraded from 2.21.2 to 2.21.0 based on a stack overflow comment after I ran into the same issue as this guy:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10334071/capybara-selenium-rspec-loaderror-when-setting-js-to-true
[06:04:05] lukeis: always listen to jarib's comments ;)
[06:05:36] idahoev: hmmm… wasn't jarib's that solved it for me, though; couldn't upgrade multi_json … I think the version is a fixed dependency for capybara
[06:05:59] idahoev: maybe that will fix at the same time when I try the git head for capy.   Will let you know in a moment… :-)
[06:14:45] idahoev: :-)
[06:15:04] idahoev: I came from php and java, and still do a fair amount of java.   But ruby pays the bills these days.
[06:15:18] lukeis_ has joined #selenium
[06:16:34] idahoev: git version of capy exposed some other error that prevents my spec stack from starting up at all, so I don't think that's a help.   May look into switching to chromedriver.

[06:17:53] lukeis has joined #selenium
[06:20:16] lukeis_ has joined #selenium
[06:20:43] lukeis_: you'll still get an issue I think in chromedriver... you may just want selenium version < 2.19
[06:21:21] lukeis_: :changes
[06:21:21] selbot2: .NET: http://goo.gl/SL88L | Java: http://goo.gl/50JPE | Ruby: http://goo.gl/K9ayk | Python: http://goo.gl/Ikm8u | IDE: http://goo.gl/tm4FM
[06:22:01] lukeis_: yeah... it was 2.19 that introduced the exceptions thrown when alerts/prompts aren't handled
[06:37:20] jeichar has joined #selenium
[06:37:31] idahoev: yeah.  and our code handles the prompts, but released capy wraps the click handler in a wait_until()  that makes the prompt appear to be unhanded before capy's click method returns
[06:38:01] idahoev: will selenium < 2.19 work with FF12?    That's what triggered the upgrade from 2.16 to 2.21.
[06:38:31] lukeis_ has joined #selenium
[06:39:36] lukeis_: nope... you're in a catch22 situation you need the latest to run FF12 :)
[06:39:57] idahoev: … yeah, just figured that out
[06:40:22] idahoev: well, i did get it working with edge capybara and 2.21.0.   2.21.2 still fails though.
[06:40:45] lukeis: that's good / progress i suppose
[06:41:11] idahoev: but capybara removed a lot of wait_until calls in edge version, looks like I'm going to have to put explicit waits in my tests in a … an awful lot of places
[06:41:26] idahoev: but at least that's a known problem, so I have an endpoint I can see
[06:41:30] idahoev: thanks for the many tips
[06:41:39] lukeis: np, good luck
[06:44:10] lukeis: .
[06:44:14] idahoev: the point with the chromedriver suggestion would be that I could run selenium < 2.19
[06:44:27] idahoev: since I can't with FF now that it's updated
[06:44:35] lukeis: yes
[06:45:00] lukeis: :note dawagner your bot is not logging comments done with /me
[06:45:01] selbot2: ok!
[06:46:12] lukeis: idahoev: although you'll want to be careful about which version of chromedriver you use, since at some point it starts doing the exceptions with alerts too
[06:46:48] idahoev: lukeis: yeah.   going to stick with edge capybara and 2.21.0 for tonight.
[06:47:26] lukeis: welcome to the *bleeding* edge :)

[10:23:25] Kalyan_: Actions actions = new Actions(driver); 		WebElement webElement = driver.findElement(By.id("nav:/project1:text")); 		actions.contextClick(webElement).method();
[10:23:34] Kalyan_: This code is not working for me
[10:23:41] Kalyan_: am I doing any thing wrong
[10:23:57] Kalyan_: Thnaks for your reply.
[10:24:00] barancev: Kalyan_: what's .method() in the end?
[10:24:26] Kalyan_: sorry : actions.contextClick(webElement).perform();
[10:25:34] barancev: Kalyan_: so, what's the issue?
[10:26:37] Kalyan_: The issue is when I run the script, selenium dosent perform the function.
[10:27:05] barancev: can you show the page? is it available?
[10:27:24] Kalyan_: sure
[10:28:47] Kalyan_: mbed.org

[10:31:23] barancev: it the page available without login?
[10:32:30] barancev: btw, what browser/os are you using?
[10:32:35] barancev: and what selenium version?
[10:33:13] Kalyan_: version: 2.21.0
[10:33:25] Kalyan_: I am using firefox on Vista
[10:33:48] Kalyan_: The page is not available with out login & pwd :-(
[10:35:35] barancev: what firefox version?
[10:35:52] Kalyan_: firefox version: 12.0
[10:36:25] barancev: it explains something
[10:36:54] barancev: you have to either downgrade to 11.0 (or earlier), or wait for selenium 2.22
[10:37:43] Kalyan_: Ok, I will down grade to 11.0
[10:38:00] Kalyan_: I will try and let you know. Thanks for your help.

[10:44:45] Eleccy has joined #selenium
[10:45:26] dawagner: That *does* seem inconvenient...
[10:45:35] barancev: it's either dns problem, or debug server low capacity, or may be you have other ideas
[10:46:00] dawagner: I doubt it's DNS
[10:46:10] dawagner: The timing seems to have coincided with flipping to webbit
[10:46:30] barancev: it started in the beginning of May
[10:46:40] barancev: started to fail
[10:46:51] andreastt: dawagner: …
[10:46:52] barancev: about May 5th-6th
[10:46:55] andreastt: dawagner: Where abouts are you?

[11:11:08] barancev: ave, simonstewart!
[11:12:57] barancev: dawagner: can you modify sauce runner to include job id to the stacktrace message?
[11:13:11] barancev: it'll allow to find the job that failed
[11:13:13] simonstewart: The logs in that CI build indicate that we've called quit frickin' masses of times
[11:14:07] dawagner: barancev: Will do
[11:14:11] dawagner: simonstewart: Indeed...
[11:14:15] dawagner: Actually
[11:14:25] dawagner: I think ~that number is expected in our test suite
[11:14:50] simonstewart: But why right at the end?
[11:14:59] simonstewart: We should see one per test suite
[11:15:02] simonstewart: (ish)
[11:15:11] barancev: dawagner: this log shows that 74f4d8dfafc24bcdbeec1b303eece483 - OK, a2b2617307b443e38784fa7d9b7caf63 - OK, but the next job 664fccd0f78c41b08b1b968c5ba58d25 failed
[11:15:23] barancev: due to debug server inaccessibility
[11:15:41] dawagner: We should see it ~20x per suite.  Yeah, the bit at the end is funky
[11:16:09] barancev: and the fourth one is OK again -- 84c4c6b928744b4c9945977f6951f7ca
[11:16:28] barancev: yes, we have had 20 parallel jobs
[11:16:32] dawagner: barancev: My guess is it may help to restart the app server if something dies at the sauce end, but I need to work out why
[11:16:41] barancev: now santiycr said we have 30
[11:17:37] dawagner: The parallel jobs are irrelevant :)

I can simulate "Job x has already finished" and "Job x is not in progress" by killing sessions and trying to use them, but I can't seem to simulate it.

[13:04:49] nirvdrum: Now, some stuff, like Safari support in RC are likely to never get fixed just due to security issues there.  But, the RC driver could be reworked as a WebDriverBackSelenium driver and could possibly work in that case.

[16:28:19] simonstewart: Does the Java IE driver use the IE remote server yet?
[16:28:26] jimevans: yes.
[16:28:33] simonstewart: A quick read of the code says that it's still using the DLL
[16:28:58] simonstewart: Ohhh… so the IEDriver.DLL starts the server?
[16:28:59] jimevans: barancev implemented the functionality
[16:29:08] santiycr: dawagner: IIRC, it's a timing thing
[16:29:14] jimevans: no, we look for the server, if we don't find it, we drop back to the dll.
[16:29:25] WSelenium has joined #selenium
[16:29:29] jimevans: .NET isn't so forgiving.
[16:29:38] santiycr: depending on the second you send your command, you'll get all the way to our vm, which will respond with RC server already being shut down
[16:30:00] santiycr: or you can hit our main hub, if you get in a couple of seconds later, when the node has already been destroyed
[16:30:03] WSelenium: When is Selenium 2.22 scheduled to be released?
[16:30:04] jimevans: we look for it, and if it ain't there, we throw, telling you to either use the capability to enable the legacy server or download the standalone server.
[16:30:46] jimevans: which sucks, but there's not a standard logging mechanism for .NET like there is for almost every other language bindings (you can't count on people looking at console output for .NET)
[16:30:51] dawagner: santiycr: I think that covers the two error messages I thought I understood; "Job x {has already finished,is not in progress}" - what about "Selenium server in Sauce Labs was already shut down"?

[16:32:17] noahsussman has joined #selenium
[16:33:20] santiycr: yeah, as I expected, that error means your command made it all the way to our node, while the rc server in it was tearing down
[16:33:41] jimevans: simonstewart: in InternetExplorerDriver.java, look at the setup() method. it looks for the capability "useLegacyInternalServer", and tries the standalone server if it's not there (which it's not by default). if the server can't be found, it falls back to the legacy server (the all).
[16:33:45] santiycr: this happens as our nodes generally do some stuff after the test is over

[18:52:16] lukeis: the html tab shows the html markup... the DOM is essentially a reflection of that... but can obviously be changed ;)

[18:54:37] lukeis: np :)
