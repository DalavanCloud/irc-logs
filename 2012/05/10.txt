[17:23:43] llaskin: woops
[17:31:11] llaskin: hell yes
[17:31:58] andreastt: Is Keys.SHIFT + 2 meant to produce a special character, or is that beyond the scope of Selenium?
[17:32:10] andreastt: I mean, based on the keyboard layout.
[17:32:23] simonstewart: IT should do whatever that does on the native keyboard
[17:32:39] simonstewart: For aynthetic events, we pretend that everyone's american
[17:32:47] andreastt: Which implementations respect this?
[17:33:00] stockton has joined #selenium
[17:33:07] simonstewart: The Win32 native events are good
[17:33:10] simonstewart: Or should be
[17:33:34] simonstewart: Don't worry. I may change it to an Indian keyboard layout
[17:34:12] lukeis: if we went by the most % of users that may be the right thing to do
[17:34:30] andreastt: I'm not sure we're going to be able to support that due Opera's infrastructure (our core component essentially has no clue about the local environment or product), but I'll investigate.
[17:34:52] simonstewart: k
[17:35:01] simonstewart: Default to the US too might well be a good idea
[17:35:06] simonstewart: (at least its consistent)
[17:35:16] simonstewart: Though there's an argument for using Norwegian....
[17:35:26] dawagner: Ok, seriously, how does one set unlimited core dump size on ubuntu?
[17:35:45] simonstewart: ulimit something-or-rather
[17:35:52] llaskin: hey guys..any idea if SE conf will be in the US next year?
[17:35:57] dawagner: I don't seem to have permission to set it to more than about 16k
[17:36:02] simonstewart: Yes, it'll be in the US
[17:36:07] simonstewart: we're still debating which city
[17:36:15] Dude-X: llaskin: it will be in the east coast most likely
[17:36:15] simonstewart: sudo ulimit?
[17:36:25] llaskin: oh god yes
[17:36:26] llaskin: BOSTON
[17:36:28] llaskin: PLS GOD BOSTON
[17:36:35] simonstewart: llaskin: if we had a local organizer in NY we'd most likely be there
[17:36:51] simonstewart: But so far we've only had volunteers for Florida and (I think) Chicago
[17:36:52] llaskin: simon: if in boston, and red sox are playing, i'll bring you to good seats
[17:36:53] lukeis: we have local organizers in boston ;)
[17:36:56] dawagner: ulimit is per-shell, so that would only work for the root shell, which I don't want to use
[17:37:03] Dude-X: what it takes a local organizer?
[17:37:03] llaskin: me and nirvdrum and cgoldberg can coordinate boston i bet
[17:37:08] simonstewart: Boston might be an option
[17:37:12] Dude-X: maybe i should volunteer for new york city
[17:37:18] llaskin: fuck new york city
[17:37:20] llaskin: woops
[17:37:22] llaskin: and the yankees
[17:37:40] cgoldberg: +1 Boston :)
[17:38:57] andreastt: simonstewart: What should be the expected behaviour if a key is not present on the keyboard?  If I ask it to input Ã¦, Ã¸, or Ã¥ and the computer's keyboard layout is American?
[17:39:02] llaskin: the winner will then be New Delhi, India
[17:39:17] lukeis: with the constraint of it being in the US ;)
[17:39:25] dawagner: andreastt: If we were doing it properly, we would let you set the keyboard locale
[17:39:44] lukeis: well, eastern North America... don't want to rule out canda necessarily
[17:39:49] lukeis: canada*
[17:39:53] andreastt: dawagner: That would involve manipulating the OS or the product in some cases.
[17:39:59] dawagner: andreastt: Yep

[17:40:35] llaskin: canada is America north.
[17:40:39] Dude-X: i'm fine with boston, nyc, toronto (is that east coast)
[17:41:05] andreastt: jleyba_: Does test_opera work for you now, by the way?
[17:41:07] stackedsax: llaskin: not 'America Lite'?
[17:42:24] simonstewart: I've raised Boston as a possibility
[17:42:53] llaskin: simonstewart: cgoldberg and I can help coordinate stuff if you need
[17:43:00] Dude-X: boston is a small city to get around in
[17:43:03] llaskin: i mean, u got MIT/cambridge here.
[17:43:05] bsilwal: ARM EABI v7a System Image is taking for ever now :(
[17:43:06] llaskin: lots of geeks
[17:43:16] llaskin: we can probably book out NERD for it if we plan far enough ahead...
[17:43:22] llaskin: there is a google and M$ branch here
[17:43:27] llaskin: as well as tons of other places
[17:45:32] Dude-X: new york city would not be a good place now that i think about it because hotels are uber expenisve here
[17:46:09] Dude-X: if the average hotel is 80-100 dollars a night, new york hotels are 100-200 a night
[17:46:54] lukeis: same really with SF... but it was held here ;)
[17:47:31] lukeis: plus you can find cheaper places to stay in NJ or Brooklyn 'close by'
[17:47:44] llaskin: lukeis:  say it right pls... "jewton"

[17:48:11] llaskin: :-P
[17:48:14] stackedsax: just trying to download it, or use it?
[17:48:16] Dude-X: New Jersey is too much of a hassle
[17:48:23] llaskin: and think, u'd have to deal with Snooki
[17:49:17] Dude-X: heh
[17:49:24] bsilwal: stackedsax: well i was trying to download Android 4.0 
[17:49:41] stackedsax: you using the filter at the command line?
[17:49:53] stackedsax: to just download the image you want?
[17:49:59] bsilwal: nop
[17:50:02] stackedsax: sort of undocumented
[17:50:09] stackedsax: let me get the command I use, one sec
[17:50:22] bsilwal: just following this http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html
[17:50:43] stackedsax: look at my comment here: https://gist.github.com/2639601
[17:52:21] bsilwal: Thanks but should i stop the download now ? 
[17:52:44] bsilwal: i think i should 
[17:53:15] Dude-X: here's a general programming question: some of my webdriver tests download files, what's a good file system watcher? what's a good way to determine if the browser is done downloading?
[17:55:40] llaskin: Dude-X use your code to watch the filesystem...
[17:56:39] Dude-X: but in my experience, watching the file system is higlhy subject to race conditions and other oddities
[17:56:49] llaskin: yes it is
[17:56:51] llaskin: so don't do it
[17:57:08] Dude-X: so that's why i ask if there's a nice safe way to do it :D
[17:58:33] lukeis: simonstewart / andreastt to your earlier conversation about keyboard strokes... assuming just US isn't really enough, MAC has a bit different layout/keystrokes... for example alt (command) 3 and 4:  Â£ Â¢

[18:00:09] simonstewart: Windows-US keyboard layout
[18:00:21] lukeis: shouldn't that be IBM ;)
[18:01:05] lukeis: cause my "windows" keyboard has a lot more strokes that i don't think you want to implement
[18:01:48] lukeis: s/windows/Microsoft/
[18:01:56] simonstewart: It's not a "media" keyboard

[19:23:38] stackedsax: you might try the x86 abi that I linked in that comment â I think it's somewhat faster
[19:23:46] bsilwal: tbh this is my first time .. getting my hands dirty with android testing.
[19:24:11] bsilwal: i'll give it a go. Is it a emulator ?
[19:24:48] baijum has joined #selenium
[19:25:16] stackedsax: it's just another option when you start your emulator: -b <abiname>
[19:25:20] stackedsax: like: -b x86
[19:25:28] bsilwal: stackedsax: trying to gain more info from here : http://bit.ly/JlcvgZ
[19:25:41] bsilwal: right
[19:26:02] stackedsax: because you're running on an x86 processor, it should be faster to run an emulator that is running natively on x86
[19:26:43] bsilwal: right.. sounds like it is a must. Just downloading the .gz atm
[19:26:55] testingb0t: yes the x86 is a bit faster, but still :)
[19:27:02] stackedsax: there is an x86 image that you probably have downloaded already â but it's only for android 2.3.3, and webdriver+android 2.3.3 runs into issues
[19:27:51] bsilwal: well i have downloaded android 4 will that work ?
[19:28:15] llaskin: happy now luke?
[19:28:15] stackedsax: so the one I linked in that comment is an image that will work for android 4 â specifically API 15
[19:28:18] selbot2: 03llaskin@gmail.com half a minute ago - LeoLaskin: Updating my information and photo.  Thanks Luke for giving me impetus to do so | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=16871 | http://seleniumhq.org/ci.jsp?r=16871
[19:29:25] stackedsax: if you donwload that abi, but it in your system-images directory, and then refer to it by the directory name you create in the system-images dir (like "x86"), you should be able to choose it by: -b "x86"
[19:29:43] bsilwal: i downloaded api 14, idk why i went for one below the latest (?)
[19:29:50] stackedsax: testingb0t: you've used the x86 binary?
[19:30:09] stackedsax: yeah, I think you'll need to get API 15 before you can use this binary
[19:30:24] stackedsax: but I haven't tried it with 14
[19:30:56] bsilwal: right let me give it a try first and if it didnt work i have to download 15, will let you know
[19:30:57] testingb0t: stackedsax: yes we're using the x86 binary, used instructions on http://blog.testobject.org/2012/04/giving-your-android-emulator-boost.html
[19:31:16] stackedsax: yep, that's where I got it from
[19:31:20] testingb0t: :)
[19:31:32] stackedsax: currently I have an issue when I first start a selenium session
[19:31:42] stackedsax: it seems to pause for a couple minutes
[19:31:50] stackedsax: and then continues happily like nothing ever happened
[19:32:10] stackedsax: testingb0t: you have anything similar?
[19:32:14] barancev: llaskin: according to simonstewart, you have had to set log level to FINE :)
[19:32:24] bsilwal: havent reached there yet ... soon
[19:32:39] testingb0t: it pauses while the emulator is up and running?
[19:32:51] stackedsax: yeah â the emulator's up
[19:33:07] stackedsax: I do adb logcat, and nothing much is going on
[19:33:29] testingb0t: hmm and you did the correct forwarding wit hadb -s xx forward tcpâ¦ ?
[19:34:04] stackedsax: yeah â and we use socat to port forward from remote hosts into the open adb port
[19:34:27] stackedsax: I send tests to my grid, my grid forwards them on to the emulator
[19:34:34] testingb0t: same here
[19:34:45] stackedsax: and as I say, the tests eventually just start running and continue like nothing ever was wrong
[19:36:23] testingb0t: can't say I experienced that yet. had some issues with forwarding sometimes failing. I basically added quite a few pollers/sleeps, use the snapshot feature and hope for the best every time a test runs on it
[19:37:41] bsilwal: ah i am wondering on  Enable KVM Support
[19:37:53] stackedsax: bsilwal: I didn't do that
[19:37:54] _md has joined #selenium
[19:38:03] stackedsax: I just grabbed the abi
[19:38:14] bsilwal: okay
[19:38:22] stackedsax: testingb0t: did you set up the KVM stuff?
[19:38:44] testingb0t: no, I tried, but since I'm running on EC2 I can't use that stuff :(
[19:38:48] llaskin: barancev: how do i do that inside my code?
[19:38:53] llaskin: i don't think i set it to anything....
[19:39:02] llaskin: is that when initializing my driver object?
[19:39:32] stackedsax: testingb0t, bsilwal: yeah, it seemed unnecessary, but probably cool if you could do it
[19:40:01] bsilwal: idk how do i do it in mac 
[19:40:31] AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
[19:40:47] bsilwal: i probably need to see intel's guide, and if it is not required i am not bothered
[19:41:09] bsilwal: looks like i need to have API 15, as per the blog
[19:41:17] stackedsax: yeah, I'd imagine so
[19:42:03] jfunk has joined #selenium
[19:42:15] testingb0t: some people are running android-x86 as an OS with virtualbox, which is a lot faster, since you don't need qemu. haven't tried that yet.

[19:43:13] stackedsax: bsilwal: it's not there because you have to download it first, I'd imagine
[19:43:22] aimbire: This is using Java and running on a Grid.
[19:44:08] stackedsax: bsilwal: it's not distributed with the sdk normally.  But I'm doing this all via command-line, so I'm just guessing at what you should/should not see at this point
[19:44:31] bsilwal: well i have downloaded it and its in my SDK folder
[19:44:46] bsilwal: unzipped it and the folder says system-images, idk why
[19:45:19] stackedsax: testingb0t: if we're using an x86 abi, are we still using qemu?
[19:45:55] bsilwal: i am a tester i send screenshots :D http://screencast.com/t/5NVjVYzV1
[19:47:29] bsilwal: oh, i can now see it in the manager under extras, but it says broken, any idea why ?

[19:48:22] nacho has joined #selenium
[19:49:18] bsilwal: well i guess, it is broken because i dont have API 15

[20:00:44] llaskin: u using xpath?
[20:04:57] aimbire: llaskin: nope, using id.
[20:05:37] aimbire: just iedriver seems to have this issue, happens every now and then.
[20:05:48] aimbire: i'd say 50-50
[20:06:06] lukeis: i would think you only get that error when you're attempting to interact with an element (like click)
[20:09:17] aimbire: lukeis: exactly
[20:09:37] aimbire: but it happens before on the wait process
[20:09:44] llaskin: luke: check the update to the contributors page
[20:12:35] aimbire: if i could
[20:12:46] aimbire: id just never test ie anyway, but its a demand unfortunatly
[20:13:02] stephend has joined #selenium
[20:13:10] aimbire: either way, safari, firefox and chrome work like a charm, if theres any workaround id be happy with it.
[20:13:38] lukeis: aimbire: looks like a problem with the atoms working appropriately (namely javascript error) if you could show it reproducing somehow and which version(s) of IE are affected we can likely fix it
[20:14:39] lukeis: llaskin: classy with the caricature... have a problem with your real mug? ;)
[20:16:15] lukeis: aimbire: is it possible the page is loading/unloading at the time the call is being made when you get the failure?
[20:16:43] llaskin: lukeis: its actually done by a coworker
[20:16:44] aimbire: not the page itself, but it is possible that it has some jquery behind it
[20:16:46] llaskin: and i like it as an avatar
[20:17:16] aimbire: unfortunatly i can't provide a reproduction as it is corporate material well guarded by contract
[20:18:28] aimbire: in these cases, what could be done?
[20:19:07] aimbire: i honestly have a huge load of trouble with the ie driver, making me develop mainly using firefox the whole way then just try and "port" to the other solutions.
[20:20:02] llaskin: aimbire: if you have a problem you can do 1 of 2 things
[20:20:15] llaskin: 1) bitch and moan about a free product  2) submit a patch to fix whatever your problem is
[20:20:20] llaskin: 1 leads to results

[20:21:00] lukeis: aimbire: create a sample html page that can reproduce the issue without corporate materials included... which is a lot of work potentially, but the only way to get something in front of us to fix
[20:21:47] aimbire: lukeis: ill try to request the dev team if they can provide us with this.
[20:21:50] lukeis: isolate an element it has failed on and try to see it's html structure / css / javascript events associated to it as a start
[20:22:30] aimbire: llaskin: im not bitching, i love selenium, my bitching goes to IE in general for being an awful browser and making everyone waste time with just a deprecated navigator.
[20:23:11] aimbire: lukeis: sure thing, im goint to try investingating more endearly the elemnts in question grab more info and return with what i can get
[20:23:28] aimbire: thanks for the help :)
[20:24:06] llaskin: aimbire: the guy leading the charge of IE selenium stuff who is in here right now, has been getting a lot of complaints, and i'm standing up for him while he ain't here.

[20:34:10] stackedsax: you're tring to create an avd?
[20:34:17] bsilwal: i have already created AVD
[20:34:32] stackedsax: then something like
[20:34:33] bsilwal: i used ./android create avd -n my_android -t 12 -c 100M where -t is different for me
[20:34:57] stackedsax: good

[20:35:21] stackedsax: emulator -avd my_android -port $CONSOLE_PORT -no-boot-anim -noaudio &
[20:35:29] stackedsax: or something similar from the command line
[20:36:45] bsilwal: how do i ensure that it is using x86 ? 
[20:37:29] bsilwal: i dont think it is using for me. When I did emulator-x86 -avd ....... it gives me invalid CPU architecture

[20:58:03] bsilwal: is same as in Virtual box or vagrant ? 
[20:58:30] testingb0t: the way I use it: I create the AVD with snapshot enabled. I install all the stuff to run selenium tests against it. then close the emulator. The next time you start it, it will be faster and will have all the necessary selenium stuff ready

[21:13:02] achiluk: for the fix, I needed to use firefox-chrome.js, so I put this file under selenium-core\trunk\src\main\resources\core\scripts and compiled it
[21:13:02] jarib: actually, in ruby it's even simpler
[21:13:03] llaskin: woops

[21:13:21] jarib: i'll gist you an example
[21:13:34] llaskin: or(and i already have find_element overridden), just rescue a NotFound exception with the how,what?
[21:13:39] achiluk: but when I run it, I get error                 : <br/>Exception Details    :core is not defined<br/>Stack Trace
[21:13:39] achiluk:           :com.thoughtworks.selenium.SeleniumException: core is not defined<br/>
[21:13:59] lukeis: jimevans: as a layman to all things IEDriver, how would one get the logs (ones that get stuffed into LOGHR in the cpp code)? minding that i do not and will not have visual studio... so is it even possible? 
[21:14:06] achiluk: does any body have an idea on how to fix this?
[21:14:53] lukeis: achiluk: can you try with the latest jar? 2.21 ;)
[21:15:13] lukeis: it is a drop in replacement...
[21:15:28] lukeis: maybe... i'm not certain about the 1.0 beta's
[21:15:47] achiluk: I know it works with the latest jar, but I want to put the fix in 1.0 beta 2
[21:15:57] lukeis: why would you want to do that?
[21:16:16] achiluk: we haven't still ported completely to the latest
[21:16:38] lukeis: i don't think you're going to get any takers to help with that task...
[21:17:24] achiluk: hmm ok, doesn't feel like it is too complicated
[21:17:56] achiluk: it is just being able to use firefox-chrome.js with selenium 1.0 beta 2
[21:18:10] llaskin: its not that its uncomplicated
[21:18:15] llaskin: we no longer suppport RC modification
[21:18:18] lukeis: not that it's too horribly complicated, but it's a step backwards instead of forwards... you should work on using the newest jar... you can still use Selenium interface and don't have to use WebDriver
[21:18:33] lukeis: llaskin: that's not a true statement
[21:18:47] lukeis: no one happens to be modifying RC
[21:18:52] lukeis: or caring to
[21:19:04] llaskin: ok
[21:19:08] llaskin: fineeeee
[21:19:54] achiluk: all I did was, modified selenium-browserbot.js to use the method from firefox-chrome.js, although the file is there it still throws an error at run time not at compile time

[21:20:52] llaskin: intersting
[21:20:55] llaskin: lemme give it a wing
[21:21:10] llaskin: i know exactly where that would go in my code too
[21:21:52] lukeis: that's pretty cool jarib ... wonder if we should have something similar in python ;)
[21:21:54] jarib: llaskin: updated the gist with a second version as well
[21:22:08] jarib: (you can pass anything that responds to #call basically)
[21:23:00] jarib: llaskin: here's the full interface you can implement http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Support/AbstractEventListener.html
[21:23:12] jarib: s/interface/protocol i guess is the right term..
[21:23:36] llaskin: yea but jarib, that prints it for EVERY find element
[21:23:46] llaskin: i only want it to print if it fails to find the element
[21:24:51] lukeis: wouldn't it just be the last one printed?
[21:25:02] llaskin: it prints the output after every find_element call
[21:25:09] jarib: you want to log the exception
[21:25:12] llaskin: exactly
[21:25:21] llaskin: with more then just "NoSuchElementError"
[21:25:32] llaskin: actually wait
[21:25:34] llaskin: i am talking about the wrong one
[21:25:39] llaskin: cuz no such element error already does that
[21:26:00] lukeis: weren't you talking about stale reference exception before?
[21:26:07] jarib: yeah, we could add exceptions to the protocol.. i think java has that already
[21:26:11] jarib: it just wasn't as easy to add

[21:26:13] selbot2: http://illicitonion.com/selogs/selenium/2012/05/10.txt
[21:26:23] llaskin: yes stale reference i think

[21:27:49] jarib: you should just switch to watir-webdriver ;)
[21:29:01] llaskin: that probaly requires a large amount of refactoring doesn't it?

[21:30:41] sumxyz has joined #selenium
[21:31:06] jarib: llaskin: hard to say, depends on how motivated you are :)
[21:31:59] jarib: main thing to be aware of is that elements in watir are lazily located
[21:32:57] jarib: so where in selenium-webdriver; d.find_element(:tag_name => "div") raises if not found, browser.div in watir will never raise (always return a Watir::Div instance.)
[21:33:34] jarib: which means you can do things like browser.div.exists? #=> false, browser.div.when_present.click etc
[21:36:01] llaskin: as opposed to div.find_elements(:tag_name, "div").count > 0 ?
[21:37:37] jarib: yeah, that's not the point though, it may impact how you structure your code quite a bit
[21:37:42] jarib: try it and see
[21:40:47] lukeis: i should make a watip ;)

[21:49:46] jimevans: the answer is you don't. We don't call the log functions.
[21:49:56] jimevans: it's a major failing of the IE driver.
[21:50:01] jimevans: i just don't have time to fix it.
[21:50:56] lukeis: ahh

[21:51:20] lukeis: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/cpp/IEDriver/Script.cpp#220
[21:52:16] jimevans: right. can you give me a clue what, in particular is failing?
[21:52:23] opapo: lukeis: thanks.  That helped.
[21:53:36] lukeis: ah, sorry... jimevans was trying to troubleshoot for another user... he gets "Error determining if element is displayed"  from http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/cpp/IEDriver/CommandHandlers/IsElementDisplayedCommandHandler.h#58
[21:54:03] lukeis: was running it down and my best guess is the atoms javascript failed... but could be a few other errors instead
[21:55:15] jimevans: no, you nailed it. it's pretty much guaranteed to be in the atoms code.
[21:55:26] jimevans: or, rather, in the execution of the atom.
[21:56:07] lukeis: yeah... so just running the atoms test in IE should reproduce (if he provides html that reproduces)
[21:57:14] jimevans: theoretically
[21:57:21] lukeis: :-D
[21:57:49] lukeis: how's the boy? out of the woods?
[21:59:01] jimevans: getting there. still having coughing fits. have a followup with the doc tomorrow, and i'm hoping he'll be cleared to go back to school.
[21:59:56] lukeis: ugh, that can't be fun.
