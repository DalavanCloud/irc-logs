[11:12:02] ElxRoman: barancev: Can You help me with that? I saw You work with that...
[11:13:27] ElxRoman: I've post there some idea to fix http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=3825 it helps for me

[11:19:29] ElxRoman: I haven't it for now, but i think I will check .top some where, and then create tests and patch...
[11:25:43] dawagner: andreastt: That does appear to be the case... Ugh...
[11:28:12] ElxRoman: one more question, what format I need to create tests? Java code? and HTML page?
[11:31:42] dawagner: andreastt: simonstewart's answer is we're going to push to JDK6, beacuse 5 was EOL'd in 2009
[11:32:13] andreastt: \o/
[11:32:21] andreastt: I was hoping very much for that answer.
[11:33:50] AutomatedTester: omg... a Java project moving with the times
[11:37:57] ElxRoman: barancev: You was right... "there must be .top somewhere" it helps...
[11:42:03] dawagner: AutomatedTester: We're only one JDK behind, now...
[11:42:45] AutomatedTester: when is 6 EOL?
[11:45:45] barancev: with the new IEDriverServer, I hope, selenium will be JDK 7 compatible
[11:46:17] dawagner: barancev: We currently are JDK7 compatible, no?
[11:46:21] AutomatedTester: barancev: lets not be silly

[13:01:06] zac_sel: AutomatedTester, yeah but folders suffxied with the version numbers

[13:03:50] zac_sel: which o/s
[13:03:51] zac_sel: ?
[13:03:59] nirvdrum: zac_sel: Win.
[13:04:02] zac_sel: ta
[13:04:59] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: So, a request with the "firefox_binary" capability set and Firefox installed to a non-default location on the remote side.
[13:05:21] zac_sel: hmm yes we have one in the default location on that node
[13:05:28] zac_sel: let me test locally before I bollox up our grid :)
[13:06:30] zac_sel: actually my local grid doesn't have firefox isntalled in the default location
[13:06:47] zac_sel: so it should replicate it
[13:08:34] zac_sel: I cannot replicate it. but I wonder why if you are running a grid with binary locations declared why you owuld need to do: locateFirefoxBinaryFromPlatform(); 
[13:08:34] zac_sel:  ? 
[13:09:25] zac_sel: hm it's an internal command
[13:10:09] simonstewart: Thanks mercurial. That was unnecessarily convoluted
[13:11:05] nirvdrum: zac_sel: Are you using RC or WD?
[13:11:11] zac_sel: WD
[13:11:16] nirvdrum: Hmm . . .
[13:11:41] zac_sel: should 32/64 bit windows make any difference?
[13:11:45] nirvdrum: Okay.  It could be something whacked out with my env.  But the codepath quite clearly looks for Firefox in a location I don't have it installed to.
[13:11:53] nirvdrum: zac_sel: I don't believe so.
[13:12:00] zac_sel: yeah I wouldn't have thought so either
[13:12:48] nirvdrum: zac_sel: If you don't specify the firefox_binary in the request then, it'll fail for you, right?  Because it wouldn't be able to locate otherwise.
[13:13:23] zac_sel: let me try a direct request bypassing our test tool

[13:37:30] nirvdrum: My guess is most people have Firefox installed in the default location and thus it just doesn't affect them.

[14:10:46] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Correct.
[14:11:03] DanTester: <AutomatedTester>  I can paste my test in PasteBin and you can have a look, my friend
[14:11:26] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Basically, auto-discovery should fail.  But, you provide a firefox_binary path, so that shouldn't matter.

[14:34:33] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: nirvdrum is hitting an issue if Firefox isnt installed in the default location

[14:37:21] simonstewart: Fixing now :)
[14:37:36] dawagner: Thanks :)
[14:37:36] nirvdrum: simonstewart: The problem is Executable has a static initializer to load up the platform binary and one does not exist.
[14:37:49] simonstewart: nirvdrum: fixing that too
[14:38:24] jimevans: g'day all.
[14:38:26] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: its for #3896

[14:38:32] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Nifty.  The error seems straightforward, so I don't mind fixing it.  Fixing the failure is easy.  I don't know if the design should change so it's not statically initialized.
[14:38:47] nirvdrum: I.e., should we bother doing the search at all if firefox_binary is supplied?
[14:39:27] simonstewart: If firefox_binary is passed in, I don't think we bother doing a check

[14:40:23] simonstewart: dawagner: humph! The executable finder is used in loads of places
[14:40:53] DanTester: brb - reading about Webdriver API - For Selenium IDE.
[14:42:09] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Unless I'm crazy, the static initializer in Executable won't allow you to specify the path without doing that default lookup: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/firefox/internal/Executable.java
[14:42:37] simonstewart: But it's static and only ever done use per jvm
[14:42:56] jimevans: simonstewart: soâ€¦ synthetic events in IE. checked in what i had. figured out that jquery issues were only with IE9. I have a test case.
[14:43:12] simonstewart: Hurrah!
[14:43:39] jimevans: should i check in the atoms test case, then?
[14:44:13] jimevans: i've no idea where to go from here as to debugging the issue further.
[14:44:32] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Sure.  But it's failing the first time I do it :-P
[14:44:46] simonstewart: if you mail me, jason and/or greg dennis a reduced test case, we can take it from where you've got it
[14:44:54] simonstewart: nirvdrum: it _should_ just be returning null
[14:44:57] simonstewart: Is it not?
[14:45:38] simonstewart: Right. Reinstating CommandLine.find and marking it deprecated
[14:45:39] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Nope.  The finder returns null, but then is passed to new File() on L162: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/firefox/internal/Executable.java#162
[14:46:18] nirvdrum: So, if we want to keep the static initializer, like I said, it's pretty trivial to fix.
[14:46:46] simonstewart: indeed
[14:48:10] simonstewart: Most of the badness appears to be in the browser launchers.

[15:05:21] jimevans: :note jleyba thanks for updating the type annotations on the mouse / synthetic inputs stuff. i've no idea what i'm doing in that regard, or what the compiler needs in terms of documentation.
[15:05:23] selbot2: ok!
[15:05:55] Dude-X: simonstewart: i haven't filed this as an issue yet, but i think that if you are inside a frame after a switch to frame call, and you encounter an exception (say element not found) , if your error handler calls getCurrentUrl it will crash the driver so that any further calls will throw a nsURI error
[15:06:13] simonstewart: yeah. That's suboptimal
[15:06:22] eanxgeek: anyone know what's going on here, looks like selenium's firefox driver is trying to use /usr/lib/libX11.so.6 instead of /usr/lib64?  http://bpaste.net/show/08PnTbCiwzymWcEu2ikB/
[15:07:01] DanTester: <AutomatedTester> Do you know how to export a test in the WebDriver API, please?
[15:07:50] llaskin: you can't at this time
[15:08:32] DanTester: ok, its to use htmlUnit for my tests...
[15:08:59] Andrei_Khveras: Hi Simon! Could you please explain me why in WebDriver there is no WebElement hierarchy (according to html specification)? For example, if I had Input extended from WebElement I could add methiod like typeValue, that vould be more faster than sendKeys.
[15:10:01] simonstewart: Andrei_Khveras: because it's unnecessary in the very common case
[15:10:23] simonstewart: And the abstraction we have makes it easy to add typed abstractions on top
[15:10:27] simonstewart: (e.g.: the Select class)
[15:12:43] Andrei_Khveras: I can't argue with you because of my low experience. But we have just build a big tree with html specific elements, extended from WebElement, with specific functions, most performed vie javascript snippets (check checkBox, select in dropdownd, type text quickly, etc). If it is decided one day to implement element-specific methods, I would contribute my code with pleasure.
[15:13:12] simonstewart: thanks for the offer
[15:13:16] llaskin: why would you not just find_element(:css, ".checkbox").click?
[15:13:19] nirvdrum: eanxgeek: Having not looked at this at all, are you sure your LD_LOAD_PATH is configured properly?
[15:13:20] llaskin: instead of using javascript?
[15:13:24] Andrei_Khveras: I will think over that you said
[15:13:32] simonstewart: i can recommend not using javascript snippets unless necessary 
[15:14:57] DanTester: Do you know of an easy example, I could get working, please?
[15:15:11] Andrei_Khveras: Yes, thank you. We are trying to avoid using javascript, but sometimes it's unavoidable
[15:15:16] Andrei_Khveras: Example
[15:15:22] Andrei_Khveras: executeScript("arguments[0].value = arguments[1]",element.getWebElement(), value);
[15:15:48] Andrei_Khveras: This is the fastest way to type text in inputs we have found so far
[15:16:11] opapo has joined #selenium
[15:16:21] Andrei_Khveras: Sometimes specific events (like mouseOver()) can only be fired via JavaScript
[15:16:22] jimevans: Andrei_Khveras: It also potentially bypasses event handlers on the element you're setting the value of.
[15:16:34] jimevans: (in your example, that is)
[15:16:36] DanTester: A way of see it working - then, I can change it.
[15:16:36] simonstewart: s/potentially/definitely/
[15:17:11] Andrei_Khveras: Yes, I take into account event handlers. I check if some are connected before setting value attribute via javascript
[15:17:15] ner0x has joined #selenium
[15:18:27] jimevans: but the use of javascript in that case *is* avoidable. you've just made a choice to use it for performance reasons.
[15:18:30] Andrei_Khveras: For example, if there is login field. I can set it value instantly via JavaScript and then fire event like textChanged...
[15:20:41] Andrei_Khveras: Yes, for typing javascript is avoidable (for small text pieces). But you should agreed, that sometimes is necessary to fire some event explicitly for javascript.
[15:21:13] simonstewart: Andrei_Khveras: I disagree
[15:21:25] dawagner: AutomatedTester, davehunt: How long should I expect compiling firefox to take?
[15:21:35] simonstewart: For a long time I didn't add the ability to execute JS directly to webdriver for exactly that reason
[15:21:43] simonstewart: People abuse it
[15:21:43] AutomatedTester: dawagner: last week it took me 45+
[15:21:50] dawagner: mins?
[15:21:53] AutomatedTester: yea
[15:21:57] dawagner: Ok, thanks :)
[15:22:12] AutomatedTester: dawagner: but that was on a VM with 2 cores and 4 GB RAM

[15:24:40] simonstewart: Ha!
[15:25:05] AutomatedTester: dawagner: after something specific?

[15:28:55] Andrei_Khveras: Simon. Well, I"ll take a look at WebDriver sources when have a free minute. It looks like sendKeys method sends each key in separate transaction when driving Remote Server. I might be mistaken though. The same with firing events for element via JavaScript. Let me know if it is decided to inject, so I would offer my piece of code. Thank you!

[15:50:15] IvanDM: llaskin: so, I'm using "execute_script" inside GhostDriver (PhantomJS webdriver)
[15:50:23] eanxgeek: nirvdrum: just ran one more test also, to see if firefox would actually run from my virtualenv and it did
[15:50:24] IvanDM: and now adding execute_async_script
[15:50:38] IvanDM: in the code of the atom I see that the parameter "onDone" is required
[15:50:45] IvanDM: but if I don't provide it, it works 
[15:51:06] DanTester: I'm currently trying run a test in WebDriver API - however, getting a number of errors.. see link for my test http://pastebin.com/91kTdu0G
[15:51:16] IvanDM: llaskin: in other words: I can use "execute_script" and "execute_async_script" in the exact same way - both work

[16:02:16] jimevans: nimeacuerdo: okay, let me know when it's available. I assume it's running against a public URL, or you'll include the HTML also? otherwise, the script will be useless.
[16:02:34] nimeacuerdo: I got it working against a public url
[16:02:55] jimevans: nimeacuerdo: "working" meaning "crashing the ruby runtime"?
[16:03:46] nimeacuerdo: nope, I mean being able to kill a remote webdriver instance that I use to open web pages with IE
[16:04:01] barancev: AutomatedTester: have you finished integration of IEDriverServer into python binding?
[16:04:06] nimeacuerdo: with the kind of log reported in that issue
[16:04:36] jimevans: nimeacuerdo: and what happens when you run the same test locally?
[16:05:31] barancev: jimevans: to run locally it should be rewritten in Java, I think
[16:05:52] nimeacuerdo: well, it's not even a proper "test", I'm uploading it, with further info on the config for the server side
[16:05:53] barancev: it's JVM crash, not ruby runtime
[16:06:03] jimevans: barancev: almost assuredly would make no difference.
[16:06:11] nimeacuerdo: so you can request more info just in case it's needed
[16:06:22] jimevans: the point is that the .dll is crashing. if run locally, it should take down whatever runtime it's running in.
[16:07:00] jimevans: differing semantics aside, there are very few reasons why it would crash in one language binding and not another.
[16:07:59] jimevans: hey! building the remote server builds the safari extension now! keen!

[16:09:16] IvanDM: EHM, I think I'm looking at a piece of WebDriver Atom that is, at best, confusing
[16:09:21] IvanDM: webdriver.atoms.inject.executeAsyncScript =
[16:09:21] IvanDM:     function(fn, args, timeout, onDone, opt_window) {

[16:09:34] IvanDM: who spots why I'm perplexed wins... a teddy bear
[16:10:02] IvanDM: this is inside "execute_script.js" 
[16:11:26] DanTester: In its in jUnit (WebDriver).
[16:12:18] nimeacuerdo: @jimevans haven't ran it locally, always remotely
[16:12:31] nimeacuerdo: and it was failing with php bindings also
[16:12:44] nimeacuerdo: I uploaded a ruby script just because it's way cleaner

[16:18:26] IvanDM: jarib: have you looked at the code I posted above?
[16:18:31] jarib: IvanDM: yes
[16:19:02] IvanDM: executeAsyncScript is calling executeScript inside => an async call (that has a specific behaviour) is mapped to a sync call (that has a different one)
[16:21:50] jarib: IvanDM: right, looks like it should be calling bot.inject.executeAsyncScript
[16:22:01] IvanDM: exactly
[16:22:05] IvanDM: that's what I was expecting
[16:22:25] IvanDM: fact is, changing that would potentially open a "pandoras vase of bugs"
[16:22:25] jarib: IvanDM: i suspect no one is using this atom
[16:23:27] IvanDM: jarib: well, I'm trying to use it to implement the right behaviour

[16:38:15] orangey: AutomatedTester: what I actually want is to know if I'm getting sent an ICS file as I should be
[16:38:17] AutomatedTester: orangey: you need to put a proxy in the middle and get the proxy to tell you
[16:38:20] AutomatedTester: Selenium wont
[16:38:23] orangey: or something else
[16:38:32] orangey: AutomatedTester: a proxy? Sounds overly complicated
[16:39:10] AutomatedTester: orangey: well you can test if you are getting the file via curl so you dont need Selenium
[16:39:59] orangey: AutomatedTester: hmm. OK.
[16:40:45] AutomatedTester: orangey: how would you check the header of a file as a user with the browser
[16:41:17] orangey: AutomatedTester: i guess even knowing that it's trying to send a file would be enough
[16:41:19] orangey: and not an error
[16:42:39] AutomatedTester: orangey: you can use browsermob proxy which is really simple to integrate with Selenium if you really need to check

[17:43:33] IvanDM: but in theory should without issues
[17:44:08] jleyba: webdriver.atoms.inject.executeScript and webdriver.atoms.inject.executeAsyncScript are hacks for android which can only inject into window.top (we should probably move them to a separate namespace)

[17:49:48] jleyba: krosenvold: Which URL classes?
[17:50:00] jleyba: IvanDM: I think he meant what's the default URL that a client would talk to
[17:50:00] IvanDM: simonstewart: what do u mean?
[17:50:01] simonstewart: IvanDM: when instantiating a RemoteWebDriver instance :)
[17:50:15] IvanDM: simonstewart: AH! sorry, completely misunderstood
[17:50:20] simonstewart: np
[17:50:21] jimevans: jleyba: i still have it on my list to migrate to using the injected versions of the atoms.
[17:50:24] IvanDM: simonstewart: well, at the moment it's localhost:8080/
[17:50:29] krosenvold: Java net URL 
[17:50:29] simonstewart: ahhhh
[17:50:30] jimevans: i'll get 'round to it.
[17:50:30] IvanDM: nothing special really
[17:50:33] simonstewart: ok
[17:50:35] simonstewart: thank you
[17:50:39] IvanDM: simonstewart: why?
[17:50:45] IvanDM: u expect something different?
[17:50:58] simonstewart: I was thinking of hooking up ghost driver to the normal test suite to see how it does
[17:51:10] simonstewart: If only for my own viewing pleasure
[17:51:17] jleyba: krosenvold: The com.google.common.net package is still a bit lacking.  Maybe we'll get lucky for v13

[17:52:06] IvanDM: simonstewart: I wont to move to use it, but I don't want to spend time :)
[17:52:14] IvanDM: simonstewart: I have ghostdriver itself to write :)

[18:04:16] jarib: it'll spend some time building the remote server on the first run, but should work ok after that
[18:04:40] jarib: the ruby tests are a lot less extensive than the java ones, but should work ok for bootstrapping

[18:38:11] jimevans: barancev: not without subclassing RemoteWebDriver. sorry. that's the way it goes.
[18:38:48] barancev: jimevans: isn't it possible to create something like Augmenter?
[18:38:50] jimevans: i could push ITakesScreenshot down into RemoteWebDriver, but i'm not sure that's the way to go.
[18:39:11] jimevans: barancev: i suppose, but it'd actually be easier to subclass RemoteWebDriver.

[18:46:13] eanxgeek: anyone know why native events stopped working in FF12 between Selenium 2.19 and 2.21.3 (python and Webdriver btw)
[18:46:38] nirvdrum: eanxgeek: Because FF 12 is different.
[18:47:01] nirvdrum: eanxgeek: Native events are only guaranteed to work with the latest FF release at the time Selenium is released.
[18:47:06] lukeis has joined #selenium
[18:47:11] eanxgeek: nirvdrum: hehe yeah but all my stuff was working with FF12 + selenium-server-2.21 + python selenium-2.19

[18:48:09] nirvdrum: eanxgeek: I'm unaware of them working for anyone on any published release.  But if it worked, by all means :-P  2.22 will have them working again.
[18:48:29] eanxgeek: nirvdrum: w00t thanks for that update
[18:48:34] barancev: jimevans: I understand, but why there is no such a possibility in the distr?
[18:49:05] jimevans: barancev: where would you put it?
[18:49:31] jimevans: it certainly doesn't belong in the base RemoteWebDriver. what happens when a browser doesn't support screenshots?

[20:26:05] AutomatedTester: dawagner: I never signed up with spotify because when I looked a while back I could only sign in with Facebook
[20:26:25] dawagner: I'm somewhat confused by its queue system; if my queue is empty, it picks random music I may like, which meant it just jumped me from Sting to LLCoolJ, which was a bit of a shock
[20:27:02] AutomatedTester: dawagner: I dont push things into my queue
[20:27:05] jcrza: Hey guys. if I'm clicking a submit button that starts a file download in firefox via selenium is there a clever way to grab that file and rename it/save it somewhere else rather than just monitoring the folder with a check and trying to move the file manually after every download?
[20:27:51] dawagner: I wasn't using the queue, I was just playing an album
[20:28:26] dawagner: And it seems to be less content-rich than Spotify
[20:28:30] barancev: why node capabilities contains no information about platform? {seleniumProtocol=WebDriver, browserName=firefox, maxInstances=5}
[20:29:53] barancev: for firefox it is no matter, true
[20:30:13] barancev: but for IE it is sufficient -- as a result, it does not match a requested capability {platform=WINDOWS, ensureCleanSession=true, browserName=internet explorer, version=}
[20:31:39] barancev: or, should we consider missing platform in the node capabilities treat as ANY?

[20:51:29] adamgoucher: ya
[20:52:13] adamgoucher: "If this command is never sent, the driver should default to an implicit wait of 0ms." -- should is as dangerous a word as there is when it comes to specs

[20:53:19] adamgoucher: exactly
