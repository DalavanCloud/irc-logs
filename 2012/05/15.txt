[00:19:50] nirvdrum: Or I can just use the Java bindings.

[00:20:15] jarib: (the pre-release gem)
[00:20:33] jarib: so it should work with safari from trunk (unless jleyba introduced more breaking changes?)
[00:20:44] nirvdrum: Okay.
[00:20:54] nirvdrum: This is my first time trying and I'm trying on Windows.
[00:21:03] jarib: what happens?
[00:21:04] nirvdrum: The browser starts up, but the network seems to block.
[00:21:17] jarib: oh, hold on
[00:21:23] nirvdrum: That's if I run locally.
[00:21:33] jarib: r16718

[00:21:36] nirvdrum: Remotely, I get an error about the checkState precondition being bad.
[00:21:38] stockton_ has joined #selenium
[00:21:57] jarib: ok, commits indicate the rc should work
[00:22:26] jarib: let me try it here 
[00:22:35] nirvdrum: So, both local and remote should work okay?
[00:23:38] jarib: i don't think the 2.21 server will work with the trunk safari extension
[00:23:48] nirvdrum: jarib: Locally, it looks like process_handshake is where things lock up.  Line 109.
[00:24:09] nirvdrum: I'm running a server I built from trunk about 2 hours ago.
[00:24:30] jarib: ok
[00:24:33] jarib: jruby?
[00:24:54] nirvdrum: Yeah.
[00:25:08] nirvdrum: I can try MRI.  It was just a lot easier to install JRuby on this Windows EC2 machine.
[00:25:48] jarib: jruby should work. 
[00:27:19] nirvdrum: Remote just doesn't work for me.  "Exception: Executor has not been started yet"
[00:27:30] nirvdrum: Local blocks, so seems like it's an issue with the Ruby bindings there.
[00:29:42] jarib: nirvdrum: ok, the extension from trunk appears to work with the RC gem on both MRI 1.9.3 and JRuby 1.6.7 for me
[00:29:49] jarib: just tried it
[00:29:54] jarib: i'm on OS X though.
[00:30:46] nirvdrum: Hmm . . . doesn't work with Java bindings locally either.
[00:30:59] nirvdrum: I guess it's an issue with the driver on Windows.  Fun.
[00:31:17] nirvdrum: The browser starts up, but the socket doesn't really seem to work right.
[00:31:24] nirvdrum: Thanks for checking.
[00:31:36] jarib: XP?
[00:31:54] nirvdrum: Win2008.  Closer to Win 7 than anything else.
[00:35:10] nirvdrum: It's possible I somehow screwed up the extension installation too I suppose.
[00:36:12] jarib: if it fails everywhere, that seems likely
[00:36:52] nirvdrum: Do you need to change any permissions when installing it?  I just followed what was in the wiki.
[00:37:03] jarib: RC gem with MRI 1.9.2 on Win 7 works for me with the trunk extension as well
[00:37:15] jarib: not that i can recall
[00:37:23] jarib: i just followed the wiki as well
[00:37:29] nirvdrum: Damn.
[00:37:50] nirvdrum: Well, thanks for checking it out for me.
[00:37:56] nirvdrum: Figure out that grid problem, by the way?
[00:39:25] jarib: i think it may have been a firewall issue
[00:39:58] jarib: i had two nodes connected, one of them wasn't reachable from the hub
[00:40:12] nirvdrum: Interesting.
[00:40:39] jarib: i'm just guessing though, didn't have time to actually prove it
[00:41:35] jarib: btw, the beta console takes a while to load in that scenario
[00:41:52] jarib: since it tries to ask the non-reachable node about how it's configured
[00:42:16] jarib: not really a big deal though.. just have to wait for the admins to get that port opened :P
[00:42:24] jarib: firewalls </3
[00:42:29] nirvdrum: That's annoying.
[00:42:37] nirvdrum: It should timeout.
[00:42:58] jarib: it does, just takes a while
[00:43:29] jarib: the more interesting problem in my case is how to deal with ports and displays
[00:44:37] jarib: since i'm running so many browsers on a single node
[00:44:55] jarib: so far, i've just subclassed FirefoxDriver
[00:45:41] jarib: and it calls out to a service to fetch a port + X display to start on
[00:45:54] jarib: (the service maintains a pool of both)
[00:46:17] nirvdrum: You shouldn't need a different X display for each browser.
[00:46:20] jarib: then it releases both in FirefoxDriver.quit()
[00:46:36] nirvdrum: That's really only if you need to capture the framebuffer to a screenshot.
[00:46:56] jarib: firefox has issues with focus
[00:47:36] jarib: i know from hard earned experience that a separate display per browser is a lot more reliable :)
[00:47:43] nirvdrum: Heh.  Okay.
[00:47:52] nirvdrum: I'm still new to the WD side of things.
[00:48:05] nirvdrum: I hope it doesn't have focus problems on Windows.  Otherwise, I'm going to have issues.

[00:50:57] tessarakt has joined #selenium
[00:51:04] tessarakt: hi
[00:51:15] tessarakt: I have problems with WebDriver :-(
[00:51:38] nirvdrum: jarib: Looks like these only affect interacting with the page.  So, I should be okay.
[00:51:48] nirvdrum: tessarakt: You're really going to have to be a lot more specific than that.
[00:51:50] jarib: yeah, it's mostly for focus/blur events
[00:51:57] jarib: AFAIK
[00:52:01] tessarakt: umm, yeah, just had to try again
[00:52:34] jarib: nirvdrum: anyway, my concern is orphaned browsers (where quit() won't be called at all), not sure how common that is
[00:52:55] tessarakt: I have this webdriver code: http://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?46302
[00:52:57] jarib: if that happens, the display won't be returned to the pool
[00:53:39] tessarakt: and the last test does not run through
[00:54:42] jarib: i could have some timeout in the display pool service, but it seems like this should be coordinates with grid's timeouts
[00:55:01] jarib: i should probably learn more about how to extend grid
[00:55:10] tessarakt: those are QUnit tests, inside WebDriver they don't run through until the last one, so the number of completed tests does not display
[00:55:25] tessarakt: when I open the HTML page in a browser, it displays in less than a second
[00:55:26] jarib: tessarakt: any exceptions?
[00:55:48] nirvdrum: jarib: As I understand it, the hub does much better at tracking WD sessions now and can clean them up, much like it's been able to do with RC.
[00:56:05] tessarakt: well, yeah - the element is not found
[00:56:32] nirvdrum: jarib: And now I feel like an asshole.  Apparently my extension build was old or bad.  Cleaning my workspace and building again gave me a good extension.
[00:56:38] tessarakt: but sometimes it DOES run through ...
[00:56:46] tessarakt: not really reproducible ...
[00:56:46] jarib: nirvdrum: no worries :)
[00:57:02] nirvdrum: I should stick to my mantra of always doing "./go clean"
[00:57:10] nirvdrum: I've seen too many weird things happen with the build.
[00:57:20] jarib: yeah :(
[00:57:34] tessarakt: "Wait<WebDriver> wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);" is a 10-seconds wait?
[00:57:51] Dude-X: yes
[00:58:01] Dude-X: well up to 10 seconds
[00:58:05] tessarakt: umm
[00:58:15] tessarakt: ok, then I am using it wrong, I guess
[00:58:29] Dude-X: what do you want to wait for? to get an element?
[00:59:01] tessarakt: yeah
[00:59:08] tessarakt: I should just set an implicit wait?
[00:59:21] Dude-X: that would be WebElement element = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(ExpectedCondtiions.presenceOfElementLocatedBy(by))
[00:59:28] Dude-X: that's another alternative
[00:59:40] jarib: nirvdrum: yeah, the logic should probably live in the hub, but that assumes i can know what node, display and port the orphaned session was running on..
[00:59:44] Dude-X: i don't use implicit waits; i only have wrapped calls that do webdriver waits
[00:59:48] tessarakt: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); WebElement qunitTestResultsElement = driver.findElement(By.id("qunit-testresult")); should also do?
[IRC logfile - Started Tue May 15 01:00:05 2012]
[01:00:05] Dude-X: that can work too
[01:00:09] jarib: anyway, i'm anticipating problems i don't have yet. i'll just bite the bullet and read the code at that point :)
[01:00:21] Dude-X: sets the whole session to wait up to 10 seconds
[01:00:32] nirvdrum: jarib: I'll get that workshop code up in a throwaway repo for you.  I was waiting to find a permanent home for it, but Simon wanted to wait until Kristian was done with his git stuff.
[01:01:10] jarib: cool, that'll help
[01:01:16] tessarakt: I guess sometimes it's fast enough for 0
[01:01:29] tessarakt: when thread interleaving is working nicely or something like that
[01:01:40] tessarakt: and that's why it did not always fail
[01:01:47] Dude-X: webdriver isn't threadsafe though
[01:02:02] Dude-X: unless you spawn different JVMs/processes
[01:02:12] tessarakt: and also that was the reason why the screenshot was not complete
[01:02:54] Dude-X: goin home
[01:03:31] tessarakt: ok, thanks for enlightening me and resolving my misunderstanding
[01:03:33] tessarakt: works fine now

[11:18:06] NReijmersdal: but often to late before the whole machine is overloaded
[11:18:36] NReijmersdal: Shouldnt it hold new sessions on this node until the BROWSER_TIMEOUT is reached?

[17:20:09] nirvdrum: jarib: Minor victory, but I got Phillipe to point his project at your gem: https://github.com/ph7/selenium-client
[17:20:44] nirvdrum: skiphuffman: The beta console still has some rough edges, like that round corner way out of place, but the plan is to make that the default console soon.

[17:27:19] jimevans: jleyba: yeah, can't get the damned thing to behave. so i'm inside webdriver.atoms.element.type, and by adding console.log write lines in the else if block that starts at line 210.
[17:27:38] jimevans: i can see that we're evaluating webdriverKey to be the correct object.
[17:27:48] nirvdrum: skiphuffman: So, everything's working well for you now?

[18:21:50] jimevans: aha! it's not all keys!
[18:25:12] lukeis: jimevans: so... i know why it's not dragging in IE9, but I don't know how to fix it from our side (i had to hack jquery-ui a bit to see it work)
[18:25:42] jimevans: hrm. what's the story there?
[18:25:59] lukeis: the event object that is getting created and fired is not setting event.pageX and event.pageY  ~ which jQuery depends on to determine where the mouse is located
[18:26:10] lukeis: it's always 0
[18:26:13] simonstewart: Right. Home time
[18:26:17] simonstewart: G'ngiht!

[18:26:37] lukeis: if i hack jquery to use event.clientX / clientY  it works ;)
[18:27:23] lukeis: i tried to explicitly set it in the event object... but IE9 would always reset it to 0
[18:29:53] lukeis: so i guess the key is to figure out how to make sure pageX and pageY are set on the fired event object... I'm a bit at a loss there though. I tried a number of things and got nothing
