[00:19:29] dgtlmoon: greets
[00:19:48] dgtlmoon: im using php webdriver for my selenium, how do i force the browser to iexplore-8 or 9 instead of 7 which it's defaulting to?
[00:21:19] cheezy has joined #selenium
[00:36:20] nirvdrum: dgtlmoon: You can only have one version of IE installed on a machine.  It uses that version.
[00:36:56] dgtlmoon: nirvdrum, ah thanks
[00:37:12] dgtlmoon: nirvdrum, so, it seems to be using IE7 but when i open IE myself it goes to IE9 ?
[00:37:17] dgtlmoon: might have the old one still installed
[00:37:39] nirvdrum: That's quite strange.  I didn't even know that was a possible situation.
[00:38:03] dgtlmoon: yeah :) the user-agent says IE7 hmm
[00:38:08] nirvdrum: It should just use whatever's in: C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe, IIRC.
[00:38:33] nirvdrum: dgtlmoon: Are you checking the user agent on your server or did you see it in the "about" dialog?
[00:39:21] dgtlmoon: on the server, when selenium is running, i cant get to the about dialog
[00:40:17] dgtlmoon: hmm good point
[00:40:29] nirvdrum: I thought you said you could open it yourself and see IE 9 :-P
[00:40:43] nirvdrum: I'm just wondering if some wonky compat-mode setting got enabled.

[00:42:25] eanxgeek: using python and sphinx-apidoc and getting a bunch of these WARNING: autodoc can't import/find module 'pages.base', it reported error: "name 'By' is not defined", please check your spelling and sys.path
[00:42:55] eanxgeek: I can not figure out what I'm missing here
[00:43:03] dgtlmoon: nirvdrum, ill dig up a screenshot
[00:43:12] dgtlmoon: nirvdrum, thanks for the ideas, i'll get back to you
[00:43:33] eanxgeek: my elements are set up similar to the following; _tab_elements = {'dashboard_tab' : (By.XPATH, "//a[.='Dashboard']")
[00:43:41] eanxgeek: where _tab_elements = {'dashboard_tab' : (By.XPATH, "//a[.='Dashboard']"),
[00:43:43] eanxgeek: NameError: name 'By' is not defined
[00:43:45] eanxgeek: is returned

[01:46:49] adamgoucher: is there (or what is it) a timeout for webdriver commands to finish executing in remote webdriver?
[01:47:08] adamgoucher: or is that controlled entirely client side
[01:51:45] dgtlmoon: nirvdrum, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_9  , ok so IE9 will say it is IE7 in the useragent
[01:51:52] dgtlmoon: if it is compatability view
[01:51:57] dgtlmoon: so i guess my tests are running in compat view
[01:52:43] dgtlmoon: nirvdrum, so i guess, need to figure out how to enable/disable compatibility view
[01:52:52] Dude-X_: dgtlmoon, are you running it via your intranet
[01:52:55] Dude-X_: the webserver
[01:53:11] dgtlmoon: Dude-X, yes its on a virtualbox
[01:53:20] mreedell has joined #selenium
[01:54:05] dgtlmoon: Dude-X, found it!
[01:54:08] dgtlmoon: Dude-X, thanks >D
[01:54:19] dgtlmoon: Display intranet sites in compatiblity mode
[01:54:25] dgtlmoon: is an option.. would be nice to run a test with and without that
[01:55:47] dgtlmoon: hmm, the JS works in compat/non-compat mode but when run under the WebDriver it doesnt work
[01:56:14] Dude-X_: maybe you need to wrap your calls or use webdriver wait
[01:56:38] dgtlmoon: how so? its doing some stuff on document ready

[02:00:24] snuff-work: mm.. i found when using -Dwebdriver.firefox.profile=myprof (it would create FF profile copies and not delete them).. but if i used just -Dfirefox.profile=myprof (it would del the temp profiles).. but both still keep an empty plugtmpXX folder (with nothing in it)
[02:02:18] dgtlmoon: Dude-X, ok narrowed it down, looks like none of the cookie handling is working under selenium, but does if i launch it from the desktop
[02:02:34] dgtlmoon: im running it as java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.21.0.jar -port 5002 -ensureCleanSession -browserTimeout 5 -nodeTimeout 5 -debug -singleWindow
[02:03:19] dgtlmoon: cookie handling might be broken
[02:03:22] dgtlmoon: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1227
[02:08:24] Dude-X_: interesting
[02:08:34] Dude-X_: thank god i don't have to worry about cookies on my site

[02:16:19] dgtlmoon: aaaaahh!!!!
[02:16:26] dgtlmoon: when i specify -singleWindow it doesnt handle cookies right
[02:16:27] dgtlmoon: !!!
[02:22:29] dgtlmoon: !!!!
[02:22:30] dgtlmoon: :)
[02:41:45] snuff-work: mm.. is there an easy way to id what type an instantiated webdriver is (IE/FF/Chrome) ?
[02:43:50] nirvdrum: snuff-work: Ask the driver for its capabilities.  The browserName should be in there.
[02:44:38] snuff-work: i'm not seeing a method to allow me to get that.. i could be blind..
[02:45:02] stephend has joined #selenium

[03:03:32] nirvdrum: snuff-work: It depends on what languange you're in, but there should be some equivalent of driver.getCapabilities().get("browserName")

[14:11:12] _kip has joined #selenium
[14:11:21] Xtree has joined #selenium
[14:11:32] jimevans: right, so you've created a test for firefox. using Selenium IDE?
[14:11:40] DanAutoTest: yes
[14:12:37] jimevans: leaving aside the inherent maintainability problems of tests created with IDE, you'll need to read up on exporting your test to a "real" programming language, like Java, C#, Python, or Ruby.
[14:13:04] DanAutoTest: Its in a Html file, if that helps?
[14:13:24] llaskin: DanAutoTest: no it doesn't....
[14:13:36] llaskin: you need to export to a language from the IDE, such as Ruby, Java, C# or Python as said above
[14:13:43] jimevans: DanAutoTest: right. that's the default format. you'll need to export to a different format, that of a programming language. there should be a menu item in IDE for that.
[14:14:02] llaskin: also: pick a language you know
[14:14:06] llaskin: or a language you can learn quickly
[14:14:08] DanAutoTest: oh I see, thank you.
[14:14:46] DanAutoTest: php - would that be ok?
[14:15:21] jimevans: DanAutoTest: I wouldn't use PHP myself, because the WebDriver bindings for PHP aren't included with the project.
[14:15:26] DustinFay has joined #selenium
[14:15:29] jimevans: let me explain a little.
[14:16:06] jimevans: by default, when you use IDE, and choose to export your test case, you'll get code using an API called Selenium RC.
[14:16:47] DanAutoTest: Ok that's fine, mate.
[14:16:54] jimevans: on the plus side, this API mirrors pretty directly the commands you see in Selenium IDE (waitForPageLoad, waitForElementPresent, etc.).
[14:17:11] adamgoucher: ok… if i wanted to see how the :element/click request is handled by the remote webdriver server i would be looking exactly where
[14:17:13] jimevans: on the down side, that API is officially in maintenance mode now. there's no new work being done on it.
[14:17:50] jimevans: the newer, (in my opinion) better API is called Selenium WebDriver.
[14:18:10] jimevans: IDE doesn't export to that API by default.
[14:18:20] jimevans: and, no, I don't know how to make it do so.
[14:18:23] llaskin: it doesn't
[14:18:31] llaskin: while there are plans for future to make that happens
[14:18:34] llaskin: its not happening now....
[14:18:53] adamgoucher: talk to @brokenthumbs on twitter about that. php formats are his now
[14:19:16] jimevans: however, you'll quickly find that around here, at least, people will encourage you to use the WebDriver API.
[14:19:39] DanAutoTest: Cool - WebDriver API
[14:19:42] jimevans: i, for one, won't help with Selenium RC. mainly because I find the API grossly inelegant and cumbersome.
[14:20:02] jimevans: but also because I've purposefully kept myself ignorant about the API.
[14:20:25] jimevans: (I've done the same about IDE too, but that's a whole other story)
[14:21:12] DanAutoTest: Oh thanks for your help. Ok what will be the easiest way to run a test in Internet explorer, please? 
[14:21:58] adamgoucher: know what is non-helpful? grepping the source for click. sigh. :)
[14:22:15] ksummerlin has joined #selenium
[14:22:31] jimevans: DanAutoTest: okay, that's what I'm trying to get at. there isn't a record-and-playback solution for any browser other than firefox.
[14:22:34] _kip has joined #selenium
[14:22:56] jimevans: the workflow would be 1. record the test in selenium ide
[14:22:57] DanAutoTest: Sorry, understood.
[14:23:04] jimevans: 2. export the test to a programming language
[14:23:26] jimevans: 3. modify the browser startup code in that programming language to launch IE instead of firefox
[14:23:32] jimevans: 4. run the modified test.
[14:23:36] DanAutoTest: thanks friend
[14:23:54] andreastt: jimevans: How's the boy?
[14:24:19] jimevans: that workflow is vastly easier if you (a) already know how to code, and (b) skip using IDE altogether and write your tests from scratch using a programming language like java, c#, ruby, python or the like
[14:24:33] jimevans: andreastt: still got the horrible cough, but his fever is gone.
[14:24:42] andreastt: Glad to hear (-:
[14:24:55] jimevans: we've kept him out of school one more day, and hopefully he'll be back there tomorrow.
[14:26:57] llaskin: jimevans: so glad i did that

[18:17:21] andreastt: Change in group ID/artifact?

[18:23:55] krosenvold: we can't publish to maven central that way

[18:24:06] AJ__: Has anyone tried connecting ipad3 to selenium grid? It works fine in ipad1&2 but doesnt get connected to grid when using ipad3
[18:24:48] krosenvold: andreastt: maven central requires tranistive closure of deps
[18:25:27] krosenvold: and selenium can't depend on opera since it would make it impossible for us to change stuff
[18:25:58] krosenvold: the semantically correct dep is that we DGF about operadriver

[18:28:51] krosenvold: git svn clone then ;)
[18:29:18] andreastt: I did a Google search, and the Selenium website says that OperaDriver is unsupported when listing Maven information.

[18:31:47] andreastt: dawagner: Do you have any idea why Opera is failing on the CI now?  There are no logs.
[18:32:20] andreastt: Sauce is saying that the browser failed to start, but with no additional information on why.
[18:32:53] dawagner: All I have from the jenkins side is: After two hours of waiting for ./go to finish, we killed ./go
[18:33:14] RossPatterson: methods: (rewinding to 11:43) 1) Yes, as jimevans says, you can't catch errors that occur during onload, but Selenium can't catch alerts at that point either.  2) I can probably package it up for general use, but it can't go into the Selenium core because I can't sign the Contributors License Agreement.
[18:33:22] andreastt: Blech
[18:34:09] krosenvold: andreastt: that's just a subtle wording issue? It's the truth but we can make it sound nicely ?
[18:34:13] krosenvold: nicer
[18:36:01] RossPatterson: llaskin: "svn cleanup"

[19:03:38] lukeis: you could always use the JS executor to fire it yourself right after you send keys
[19:03:56] chrisculver701: lukeis: I may have to
[19:04:12] chrisculver701: any idea why it isn't firing when selenium is interacting with the page?
[19:04:24] chrisculver701: or i should say, doesn't fire all the time

[19:40:54] dawagner: jimevans: How do we decide whether to launch 32 or 64 bit IE?
[19:41:11] jimevans: in the standalone server?
[19:41:21] dawagner: Yeah
[19:41:43] jimevans: 32-bit server launches 32-bit IE. 64-bit server launches 64-bit IE. 
[19:41:54] jimevans: only way it'll work
[19:42:13] dawagner: But how does the server work out how to launch each?
[19:43:15] AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
[19:43:16] jimevans: it calls IELaunchURL()
[19:43:23] jimevans: that's how it does it.
[19:43:39] methods has left #selenium
[19:44:21] dawagner: So the absolute only reason we do all the getting of IE executable locations is to return versions?
[19:45:43] jimevans: yep. it's the only way to reliably get the version of IE installed on the machine.
[19:46:00] dawagner: Cool :) That's broken in Win8.
[19:46:09] dawagner: Which is a nice red herring on the way to fixing the Win8 problem I'm actually having
[19:46:22] jimevans: although if IELaunchURL() isn't present, (IE6) we do need the location to actually launch IE
[19:47:42] jimevans: the location of the executable should be found in the registry.
[19:47:50] dawagner: Yeah, in 64-bit mode it works fine
[19:47:58] dawagner: In 32, it segfaults :)
[19:48:04] jimevans: oooh. shiny.
[19:48:26] dawagner: The problem I'm trying to solve, rather than "the cause of the segfault"
[19:48:55] dawagner: I'm generally not a fan of native code, but this is actually quite fun :)
[19:49:28] dawagner: I *believe*, but have not verified, that the reason native events are broken in IE10 is that the 64-bit IEDriver is launching the 32-bit IE
[19:50:45] dawagner: I believe this is because they haven't shipped a 64-bit IE in the developer preview
[19:51:08] dawagner: And that launching 32-bit IE the way do is a little broken
[19:51:41] dawagner: This would make an interesting blog post, if I didn't want to stay friends with the IE team :)
[19:55:16] jimevans: hmm… i believe the LoadLibrary call should've failed in that case, but i could be wrong.

[22:09:31] jarib: back when i was young and handsome
[22:10:27] AutomatedTester: jarib: you look like a musician in that photo
[22:10:30] AutomatedTester: all broody
[22:10:40] jarib: i was :)

[22:16:01] stackedsax: if anyone else is running the android emulators on x86 architecture
[22:17:11] stackedsax: preliminary tests find this abi a lot faster: http://blog.testobject.org/2012/04/giving-your-android-emulator-boost.html
[22:17:36] stackedsax: I suppose the abi is actually here: http://download.testobject.org/dev/android_ics_x86_goldfish.tar.gz
[22:19:33] lukeis: cool, good to know... i think i'll be doing some of that in the next couple of months

[22:27:54] stackedsax: lukeis: I have a pretty little bash script which spins up n number of emulators on a box and registers them on a hub
[22:28:32] lukeis: have it somewhere on github? ;)
[22:29:13] stackedsax: a bunch of it won't apply to the general populace — the packages I'm using and package settings are all based on our internal repo stuff
[22:29:30] stackedsax: but I'll strip it down to the basics and put it up somewhere
[22:29:39] lukeis: that'd be nice :)
[22:30:04] stackedsax: there is some crucial stuff around waiting for the device to actually be ready that would be useful for the world
[22:30:15] stackedsax: the rest is fairly straightforward
[22:30:31] dawagner: Wow, when ATL shared pointers go out of scope, and you get really unhelpful stack traces
[22:30:42] dawagner: (When the dereferencing causes a segfault)
[22:30:51] jimevans: dawagner: oh, yeah. welcome to my world.
[22:31:56] dawagner: Any tips? :p
[22:33:00] dawagner: Note to self: Remember to go home before the tube stops running
[22:33:52] dawagner: jimevans: I just got Command not found: POST /session/8a021fd4-3639-4cea-8e1e-b16278219448/file running the test suite against the IEDriverServer built at head
[22:34:01] dawagner: at org.openqa.selenium.CorrectEventFiringTest.testUploadingFileShouldFireOnChangeEvent(CorrectEventFiringTest.java:390)
[22:34:35] dawagner: With a local file detector
[22:34:57] lukeis: that end point should only exist in the standalone server though?
[22:35:07] jimevans: it doesn't understand that command. local file detector isn't supported in the ie driver.
[22:35:15] dawagner: Is it going to be? :)
[22:35:26] lukeis: it's not in the wire protocol
[22:35:44] lukeis: (and shouldn't be i think)
[22:36:04] dawagner: That doesn't necessarily answer the question ;)
[22:36:20] lukeis: i don't think any of the browsers will support it
[22:37:08] dawagner: Ooh also the following keys were apparently missing translations: 1513, 1500, 1493, 1501, 1514, 1502, 1504; I'm not sure where from, I'm guessing the i18n tests or something

[22:44:00] stackedsax: https://gist.github.com/2639601
[22:44:41] stackedsax: you'll need socat, and the android_sdk, too
[22:46:41] stackedsax: I have some tricks to just install the specific images and targets I want, instead of downloading the whole 1gig+ sdk
