[00:15:26] jarib: AutomatedTester: yeah
[00:15:51] AutomatedTester: jarib: is your webdriver gem bundled with some highly used web project?
[00:20:24] jarib: AutomatedTester: not really (unless capybara counts)
[00:21:20] jarib: though it's pretty standard for rails folks to have the cucumber/capybara stack in their deps
[00:21:53] AutomatedTester: ahh thats what I was trying to remember
[00:21:59] AutomatedTester: jarib: thanks!
[00:22:18] jarib: np
[00:23:29] jarib: so yeah, looks like 75% of the downloads come from being a capybara dependency https://rubygems.org/gems/capybara

[09:07:40] hxmws: trying a few things and not got anywhere
[09:07:54] hxmws: any advice would be greatly appreciated
[09:08:22] santiycr: my advice is don't use verify
[09:08:26] santiycr: assert all you need
[09:09:04] santiycr: cramming multiple checks in the same test doesn't bring any benefits, other than making your test results hard to understand as well as slowing down your tests
[09:09:37] santiycr: :note jimevans just tested all IE versions. This issue is only present in IE7 and IE8

[09:32:24] hxmws: santiycr, thanks for the reply, problem is i'm try to replace our website monitoring tool. therefore need the script to complete a full booking transaction :-(
[09:32:32] robbim02 has joined #selenium
[09:33:29] santiycr: hxmws: why not making 10 scripts that check for each of the things you need in isolation?
[09:33:41] santiycr: that way, failures will be more clear, and you can run them all in parallel
[09:33:46] santiycr: making it run faster
[09:34:31] santiycr: one huge test = hard to read failure reports, brittle results, long time to complete
[09:35:02] santiycr: 10 short tests = detailed failure reports, more robust results, reduced time by parallelization
[09:35:38] davehunt: hey santiycr, was meaning to show you this: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mozdownload
[09:35:55] davehunt: we released our download package to PyPI :)
[09:36:47] santiycr: davehunt:  nice!
[09:36:53] santiycr: way easier for us to install
[09:37:53] davehunt: yep, mozinstall is the same, and will be enhanced soon
[09:38:10] hxmws: santiycr, I agree with what you say. But how would you test a transaction?
[09:38:23] hxmws: I mean the cookies are required as you navigate the site
[09:38:52] santiycr: hxmws: why do you need verifications if you only want to check for the transaction?
[09:39:11] santiycr: just navigate all the way through, assert all you need to confirm the workflow is correct
[09:39:35] hxmws: as a single test?
[09:39:56] hxmws: i.e assert book button assert search button
[09:42:11] santiycr: if all the assertions are crucial for testing the transaction, then why not?
[09:42:21] santiycr: if they are not, then you're not testing the transaction
[09:43:28] hxmws: cool, I think I understand what your syaing
[09:44:15] hxmws: but how can I verify if an image is present within that test?
[09:44:16] santiycr: sorry, it's not the answer you're looking for
[09:44:26] hxmws: i.e I dont want the script to die
[09:44:43] hxmws: for example  @browser.find_element(:class, 'dD')
[09:44:55] santiycr: mine is a very purist approach, but if you need to test for the transaction to happen, just test that
[09:44:55] hxmws: if dD did not exist
[09:45:08] santiycr: you're mixing functional tests with templating/integration tests
[09:45:29] hxmws: yeah, I think that is where i'm going wrong
[09:45:43] santiycr: FWIW, if I want to test for content, I generally don't use selenium
[09:45:56] santiycr: as most cases, I just need to load the html and check the nodes
[09:46:08] hxmws: ahh, OK what do you use for that?
[09:46:16] Bebe has joined #selenium
[09:46:28] santiycr: it depends on the programming language 
[09:46:38] santiycr: most have an http library and a dom parser
[09:46:55] santiycr: and probably also a "fake browser" project that glues both together
[09:47:26] santiycr: it's way faster, in case you don't need javascript execution
[09:47:53] santiycr: here's a good example: https://www.google.com/search?q=mechanize
[09:48:29] santiycr: the skill resides on figuring out what the right tool for the job is
[09:49:34] santiycr: do you really need a full browser just to check that the html returned by a web server has the content you expect?
[09:50:51] santiycr: OTOH, you definitely need a full browser to check that your javascript rich web application works as expected
[09:50:56] santiycr: alright, 2am my time, I guess I have to go to bed at some point
[09:51:04] santiycr: good luck hxmws!
[09:51:21] hxmws: santiycr, thanks for your help dude

[11:47:24] selbot2: jimevans: note from santiycr about 3 hours ago: just tested all IE versions. This issue is only present in IE7 and IE8 
[11:49:21] barancev: dawagner: the same test passed in other configurations => sometimes https works
[11:50:48] dawagner: barancev: Yeah, but I see that particular test failing every few test runs in FF11 and I believe FF10
[11:50:57] dawagner: I have moaned to AutomatedTester that the code may be buggy, but he assures me it isn't
[11:51:13] barancev: dawagner: FF10 passed: http://sci.illicitonion.com:8080/job/Firefox%2010%20XP%20Native%20Java%20Tests/780/testReport/org.openqa.selenium/PageLoadingTest/

[11:51:38] barancev: :)
[11:51:41] AutomatedTester: dawagner: what i said was my change wouldnt affect it
[11:53:22] barancev: can our debug-server serve pages with mime type application/xhtml+xml?
[11:53:39] dawagner: Yep, just give them the .xhtml extension
[11:54:13] jimevans: :note santiycr I'd really have to load it up under the debugger to figure out what's going on, and I don't have all of my test environments at the moment. Make sure the page load timeout isn't set; that's new and relatively untested code.
[11:54:14] selbot2: ok!
[11:54:20] barancev: so I think xhtmlTest.html should be renamed then?
[11:55:05] barancev: (xhtmlFormPage.xhtml has correct extension)
[11:55:25] dawagner: I think that will probably break some tests
[11:55:50] dawagner: IIRC IE<9 gives up if it encounters a page actually being served as application/xhtml+xml
[11:56:55] dawagner: Oh maven, why can't you have implicits set up so I can just type `mvn javadoc` not `mvn javadoc:javadoc`, and `mvn jar` not `mvn jar:jar`?

[12:02:31] dawagner: Almost no sites actually serve as the proper mime type, because it doesn't work
[12:02:49] dawagner: We have a couple of test-pages which are, but those tests don't run in IE8
[12:03:16] dawagner: It's not really worth us testing something that real people don't do, particularly as it only works in a handful of browsers...

[12:12:25] dawagner: (And XHTML is dead anyway)
[12:13:26] barancev: I've renamed the file to .xhtml -- and the test TextHandlingTest.testShouldReturnEmptyStringWhenTagIsSelfClosing passed in Chrome and FF12 (see #1225)

[12:13:49] barancev: (may be some other failed, should check :))
[12:14:33] barancev: so browsers use mime type, not DOCTYPE
[12:15:37] dawagner: If you want real XHTML tests, do them in common/src/web/xhtmlFormPage.xhtml
[12:15:47] dawagner: xhmlTest is used for a *lot* of things
[12:16:04] barancev: yes, I'm not going to break all the tests :)
[12:16:15] barancev: it was just an experiment

[12:17:19] barancev: so the test case and the html code can be edited in one place
[12:18:03] dawagner: I'm not sure about that; it's cute, but it can make it harder to reason about what's actually happening
[12:18:58] barancev: yes, advantages are drawbacks when you look at it from the other side

[12:22:35] AutomatedTester: prefs even
[12:22:58] foolx: hi guys! One simple question: I use Selenium 2.21.0 for testing at this moment. I now have 1 PC with Grid&Node for real tests and 1 PC with Grid&Node for testing. I created a simple setup (firefox with 'tile tabs' and 'auto refresh') to view the uses of both grids via the Grid-Console localhost:4444/grid/console. -> Finally the Question: Is there ANY way of renaming a Grid Hub? BOTH Grids 
[12:22:58] foolx: are currently called 'Grid Hub 2.21.0' and that isn't helping much ;) THANKS!
[12:23:20] barancev: who is profi in crazyfun -- why go test_firefox method=methodName runs all the tests instead of the specified method only?
[12:23:43] barancev: or it is not crazyfun but java test runner issue?
[12:25:36] dawagner: AutomatedTester: They're documented at http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/ConfigPolicy.html
[12:27:12] barancev: go test_ie method=methodName runs a single method only, unlike firefox. what's the difference?
[12:27:13] dawagner: (Does that imply marionette has the same problem?)
[12:27:36] AutomatedTester: dawagner: marionette doesnt have this problem
[12:27:48] dawagner: Yay!

[12:29:16] dawagner: capability.policy may find something
[12:31:16] dawagner: barancev: `./go test_firefox method=testShouldReturnTitleOfPageIfSet` only runs one firefox test, and 59 unit tests, for me
[12:31:19] dawagner: Is that what you're seeing?
[12:32:11] AutomatedTester: dawagner: its showing what I was looking at before

[13:27:01] dawagner: How about we introduce an assumeThat(supportsXhtml())
[13:27:20] dawagner: IIRC Jason has about 70% of the test suite passing, and I imagine will be adding Safari properly when it all passes
[13:27:51] dawagner: SeleniumBackedWebDriver is still potentially useful for unsupported browsers
[13:28:06] dawagner: Like old versions of safari, old versions of opera, custom browsers, etc

[14:42:52] jarib: hmm, launching firefox on trunk gives me Selenium::WebDriver::Error::UnknownError: Component returned failure code: 0x80570016 (NS_ERROR_XPC_GS_RETURNED_FAILURE) [nsIJSCID.getService]
[14:43:39] jarib: very odd
[14:44:30] *jarib tries a clean build
[14:45:09] foolx: does anyone know, if/how it is possible to auto-Arrange NEW Windows in Windows7? So when 5 new Firefox Instances are started via Selenium, they are not simply over each other, but side2side?
[14:46:26] brokenthumbs has joined #selenium
[14:46:31] jarib: foolx: not automatically, but you can probably write code to do it using the Window.setSize API
[14:47:27] jarib: and use driver.executeScript("return [window.screen.availWidth, window.screen.availHeight]") to determine the max size
[14:48:33] SamuraiJack has joined #selenium
[14:49:22] foolx: jarib: okay, sounds quite difficult, thought windows should be able to do the job for me ;)
[14:50:04] Bebe_ has joined #selenium
[14:50:34] llaskin: foolx: i'm curious why?
[14:50:41] llaskin: foolx: windows can
[14:50:43] jarib: foolx: there may be a way to do it, but it's not something selenium does
[14:50:49] llaskin: but selenium can't control windows
[14:50:53] llaskin: just the DOM
[14:51:04] foolx: windows can arrange open windows, but it seems that windows can't auto arrange for new windows.
[14:51:28] llaskin: you have to re-arrange it every time
[14:51:48] foolx: i know, it isn't exactly what selenium should do, but WHEN anybody nows how to do that, then the awesome guys @ #selenium ;)
[14:52:15] foolx: most tests running at this moment are just running for 20-30 seconds, then the windows are disappeared.

[15:23:00] dawagner: jarib: Apparently svn on mac doesn't by default use a sane list of root CAs when checking certs, and the cert *is* valid, svn just sucks
[15:23:04] dawagner: (so say the google code team)
[15:24:41] dawagner: jimevans: I believe you keep any LICENSEs in your source repo, keep any copyright notices in the source itself, and when distributing your binary, have a file alongside called LICENSES or similar which contains a copy of their license
