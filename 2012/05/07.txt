[00:13:20] selbot2_: 03dawagner 1 minute ago - DanielWagnerHall: Use webbit instead of jetty for our test server.  A milestone in getting rid of our many versions of jetty.  Adding some tests for the AppServer, which pass with both Jetty and Webbit.  Using webbit jar without its dependencies bundled in (so adding netty, its dependency).  Passes test_chrome, the webdriver atoms tests, as well as some manual verification, and both running in Eclipse and IntelliJ.  ...

[13:36:40] nirvdrum: andreastt: I'm going to try to give the Opera screenshot stuff a look this week for that W3C spec.
[13:37:40] andreastt: Okay.
[13:37:56] andreastt: I have some ideas about what would be ideal in terms of screen capture.
[13:38:22] andreastt: But I guess the big question is what we actually put in the spec and what we can reasonably expect browsers to support.
