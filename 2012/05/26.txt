[16:38:31] DarkRift: when using java WebDriverWait, is it a known pitfalls with grid + IE9 that if you use a WebElement found as the base search context to find another element, sometimes it is not returning what you expect it to return ? It looks like the IE driver caches information and when it's asked again for information, the information is taken from cache and not from the actual element in the page

[16:52:57] DarkRift: arf I think I know the problem
[16:53:24] Dude-X_: DarkRift, jimevans would know IE quirks the best
[16:53:29] DarkRift: wow, what an idiot this dev is
[16:55:47] dmachi has joined #selenium
[16:57:26] DarkRift: the problem is not IE
[16:57:39] DarkRift: the problem is a dev putting multiple elements with same HTML ID
[16:58:18] DarkRift: -_-
[IRC logfile - Started Sat May 26 17:01:53 2012]
[17:01:53] Dude-X_: DarkRift, i remember bitching about webdriver problems here, but i was making assumptions that the page object was doing the right thing
[17:02:03] DarkRift: yeah
[17:02:10] Dude-X_: then i looked carefully at the page object code and saw that the outsource team did some really dumb things
[17:02:34] DarkRift: just happened here
[17:02:50] DarkRift: but what lead me to think it was IE, was that it worked everytime in FF and CH
[17:03:05] DarkRift: led *
[17:03:16] DarkRift: but only once in a while for IE
[17:03:35] DarkRift: now I'll have to open a ticket so they fix that problem
[17:04:32] Dude-X_: oh one thing that bothers me is when that i discover a test passes
[17:04:37] Dude-X_: but it's doing the wrong things
[17:05:00] DarkRift: hum %
[17:05:01] DarkRift: ?
[17:05:39] Dude-X_: okay an example is a test clicks on a few things, but the things it verifies don't exist ever
[17:05:59] Dude-X_: rewrite: but then it verifies elements that shouldn't exist ever
[17:06:05] DarkRift: what bothered me on this case, is that I'm doing a proof of concept so we can use selenium to test the UI instead of doing 2 and a half month of testing with all our 12 devs just to validate all our 9 webapps are working accordingly... IE failing would have really be a no go
[17:06:15] DarkRift: ah
[17:06:17] DarkRift: yeah that sucks
[17:06:30] Dude-X_: UI validation as in checking CSS properties?
[17:06:50] DarkRift: UI validation as in executing user interactions and validating it'S doing the right things in the web app
[17:07:02] Dude-X_: oh i call that functional testing/validation
[17:07:11] DarkRift: yeah, picked up the wrong terms, my bad
[17:07:34] Dude-X_: click on thing x, outcome y happens
[17:07:47] Dude-X_: occasionally we do test for things like "is this green"
[17:07:49] DarkRift: we are spending about 3 months to test a new major release with about 15 people just to make sure our frontend work as expected
[17:08:27] Dude-X_: but i have found testing css properties is a bit flakey forwhatver reason; i remember using python to test a  css property, worked 100% of the time, java never
[17:08:30] DarkRift: we'll have some tests like that too, when I click on this, doing this icon changes to a spinning wheel, and after X time, doing it get back to a green check icon
[17:08:49] Dude-X_: i don't check for spinner loaders; i wait for them to go away
[17:09:24] Dude-X_: although now that i think about it, i should probably check there should be a spinning loader in some areas of my app
[17:09:38] DarkRift: we have a list of items we can start an execution on, should change to spiiner, then once the execution is doing, it should get back to a green check mark
[17:10:00] DarkRift: is done *
[17:10:04] DarkRift: wow, I can't type this morning
[17:10:43] Dude-X_: looks like summer weather is finally upon us in New York
[17:10:46] DarkRift: but now I temporarily fixed the IE issue ...
[17:12:01] Dude-X_: are your web driver tests flakey at times?
[17:12:16] DarkRift: what do you mean ?
[17:12:40] Dude-X_: they fail occasionally due to web driver bugs rather than a real application bug
[17:13:08] DarkRift: the only problem I've seen, is that on IE it takes more time to submit/interact with an action than FF or CH for no valid reason
[17:13:18] Dude-X_: another recent problem i have is that the build environment differes from the local environment, so some web configuration issues are different
[17:13:25] Dude-X_: IE driver is just slow
[17:13:39] dmachi has joined #selenium
[17:13:45] Dude-X_: best thing to do is test on IE9 32 bit which has the fastest javascript engine
[17:13:45] DarkRift: that slowness for me is inconsistent tho
[17:14:06] DarkRift: sometimes it's as fast as the other 2, and at other times, it takes like 5 seconds to submit the stuff
[17:14:20] DarkRift: the IE I'm using now is IE9 oon 32 bit
[17:14:23] DarkRift: on 32 bit*
[17:14:26] Dude-X_: alright
[17:15:23] DarkRift: but we'll have to test this app on IE6-7-8-9, FF, CH and Opera or safari (can't remember which of thos 2 is supposed to be supported, but we never test it really on that one)
[17:15:47] DarkRift: even our tests are not done on all the browsers
[17:16:05] Dude-X_: of all those, safari driver is the least supported
[17:16:07] DarkRift: we usually pick 3 mandatory, one IE, FF and CH, and make random spot check on the other missing browsers
[17:16:14] DarkRift: yeah I know, it's new
[17:16:15] Dude-X_: err it is supported but it's really enw
[17:16:32] DarkRift: been following this chann for a while even tho I'm not talking much
[17:16:47] DarkRift: been trying selenium since 2.0b2
[17:16:48] DarkRift: heh
[17:17:06] Dude-X_: for our project ,we have standardized on FF3.6; though i am hoping to upgrade to Firefox10 this sprint
[17:17:43] Dude-X_: our recent analytics showed more 3/4 of our customers are using FF4+
[17:17:57] DarkRift: I think the company I work for stipulates that we support FF latest and CH latest when our app is released
[17:18:26] Dude-X_: our customers are schools, so they tend to have stable platforms
[17:18:32] Dude-X_: but we don't support ie9 yet
[17:18:44] Dude-X_: 1/4 of our IE customers are using ie9
[17:18:57] DarkRift: our customers are IT
[17:19:12] DarkRift: and some of them are still on IE6 because of internal policies ...
[17:19:15] *DarkRift cries
[17:19:16] Dude-X_: unfortunately though it's going to take a good month or so to get ie9 support working in one our web apps
[17:19:23] Dude-X_: thank god we don't support ie6
[17:19:29] Dude-X_: i feel for you brother
[17:19:56] DarkRift: and it'S still supported for 2 more years ...
[17:20:00] Dude-X_: we still support ie7 officially, but our analytics showed 1 person using IE7
[17:20:03] DarkRift: geez what a crappy browser 
[17:20:16] Dude-X_: our product manager still hasn't made the call to drop IE7
[17:20:26] DarkRift: well only a part of the app is supposed to be IE6 and IE7 compliant
[17:20:33] Dude-X_: but one of our new clients is using IE7; that asshole
[17:20:38] DarkRift: heh
[17:21:33] DarkRift: only the viewing of reports is supported for IE6 and IE7, editing and configuring reports has been removed from support for those 2
[17:21:54] Dude-X_: man it would be nice to live in a world of standards
[17:22:00] DarkRift: oh yeah
[17:22:06] Dude-X_: can't wait for FF15 to come out; it gets rid of memory leaks
[17:22:21] DarkRift: wow, that will be awesome
[17:22:23] Dude-X_: FF can easily use 2GB of ram no matter how many tabs you have open :/
[17:22:40] DarkRift: it tends to take up much more memory when you have flash apps running tho
[17:23:03] Dude-X_: yeah that too
[17:23:03] DarkRift: but yeah, I move from FF to CH on my laptop because of that problem
[17:23:12] Dude-X_: at home i use Chrome for that same reason
[17:23:17] nhirata has joined #selenium
[17:23:39] Dude-X_: every now and then i kill flash plugin for chrome though, just to keep a bad flash app in check
[17:23:42] DarkRift: latest released FF is 12, isn't it ?
[17:24:04] Dude-X_: yup
[17:24:14] Dude-X_: 13 is probably slated for june
[17:24:16] DarkRift: ok so 15 will be released in like 9 months ...
[17:24:28] Dude-X_: i estimate Decemberish
[17:24:49] DarkRift: still a long time for the memory leaks to be fixed ...
[17:25:05] Dude-X_: well i don't mind if it takes them time to get it right
[17:25:22] Dude-X_: i think 15 might have marionette too
[17:25:27] jcrza has joined #selenium
[17:26:28] Dude-X_: DarkRift, i realized yesterday if i want to do a grid for test suite, it's not just a matter of executing junit tests in parallel, i have to spawn new driver instances too
[17:26:35] Dude-X_: right now my driver instance is a singleton
[17:27:48] DarkRift: oh, I analysed that first when I did my tests, and my page objects all have the webdriver as a constructor parameter so I can be isolated to a specific instance
[17:28:09] Dude-X_: i didn't write the web driver infrastructure
[17:28:25] Dude-X_: when i first joined my project it was using selenium 2.0b4
[17:28:32] DarkRift: I see
[17:28:32] Dude-X_: actually 2.0a7
[17:28:49] Dude-X_: i did the upgrades to 2.4, then 2.5
[17:28:53] Dude-X_: then 2.17
[17:29:19] Dude-X_: i also refactored our web driver API wrapper
[17:29:32] Dude-X_: to use WebDriverWait
[17:29:35] DarkRift: I still have one bug with IE tho ... but I have to write a test case for that so they can investigate, but I fell the problem might be jquery ...
[17:30:15] DarkRift: I actually ahve to use WebDriverWait about everywhere because the UI team has inserted some animations in rendering ...
[17:30:20] DarkRift: hate that
[17:30:29] Dude-X_: all my calls to findElement is wrapped with web driver wait
[17:30:56] Dude-X_: my default timeout is 30 seconds
[17:30:58] DarkRift: hummm that's actually not a bad idea 
[17:31:02] kinow has joined #selenium
[17:31:08] DarkRift: but it can insert alot of delay tho
[17:31:10] Dude-X_: though for somethings i use a 3 second wait
[17:31:15] DarkRift: hey kinow
[17:31:18] DarkRift: you're still alive
[17:31:32] dmachi has joined #selenium
[17:31:32] Dude-X_: web driver wait is pretty fast
[17:31:42] kinow: haha, hey DarkRift, thought I would find you in #jenkins
[17:31:43] Dude-X_: i am fine with a 500 millisecond pause
[17:31:55] kinow: how's it going? working on selenium plugin?
[17:32:06] Dude-X_: IDE plugin?
[17:32:22] DarkRift: Dude-X, problem here with WebDriverWait is that some of my use cases will take like 20 seconds instead of 10 if I insert a wait for every calls
[17:32:35] DarkRift: Dude-X, integrating selenium as a cluster in jenkins 
[17:32:45] DarkRift: so the nodes can launch a selenium node on them 
[17:32:54] DarkRift: and the jenkins master is the grid master
[17:33:14] DarkRift: kinow, actually it'S not on hold, just don't have much time to work on it 
[17:33:39] Dude-X_: DarkRift, it will attempt to locate first, then wait
[17:33:47] DarkRift: kinow, currently working on a demo so I can convince my company to use it
[17:34:07] DarkRift: to use selenium, not the plugin 
[17:34:08] DarkRift: heh
[17:34:17] DarkRift: Dude-X, yeah that's a good idea
[17:34:22] Dude-X_: in some tests, it takes a while to locate an element way after the element is rendered
[17:34:37] Dude-X_: but that's due to a bug in webdriver
[17:34:44] DarkRift: which bug ?
[17:34:53] kinow: DarkRift let me know if you upload the sample project or the presentation, I would like to have a look on that :D
[17:34:56] Dude-X_: whatever it is that causes web driver to flake in some cases
[17:35:05] kinow: DarkRift and maybe steal more of your ideas hahahaha
[17:35:11] Dude-X_: it is due to some odd DOM structure
[17:35:30] DarkRift: that might be related to the problem I've seen with IE
[17:35:46] DarkRift: kinow, I don't have a powerpoint, though it might be a good idea
[17:35:58] Dude-X_: every now and then i have to add a pause (thread.sleep) to overcome those flakes
[17:36:03] DarkRift: and the demo is on our internal application, and I doubt they want me to expose it freely on the web
[17:36:09] kinow: DarkRift yeah, managers love presentations haha
[17:36:30] DarkRift: the presentation is going to be with my dev boss and the 2 architects mainly
[17:36:31] Dude-X_: with 2.17, it seems that after typing something in a text box, i have to wait .5 - 4 seconds after I type something in
[17:36:33] kinow: DarkRift what are you using to create the page objects? some base project? guice? testng? :D
[17:37:14] Dude-X_: i create page objects by hand; I use firebug and fish out all the xpaths/css selectors of the elements i am interested in
[17:37:23] DarkRift: actually I don't use the PageFactory, I use the Page object design pattern with an homemade mapping of the pages in our app
[17:37:28] DarkRift: same here
[17:37:33] Dude-X_: i don't use pageFactory either 
[17:37:37] Dude-X_: but i took the time to understand it
[17:38:00] Dude-X_: seems a bit too magical for me
[17:38:02] DarkRift: I just didn't feel it would work for all the cases our application need
[17:38:20] Dude-X_: i wonder who is the owner of github.com/Selenium2
[17:38:25] Dude-X_: it's not updating anymore
[17:38:27] Dude-X_: :(
[17:38:37] Dude-X_: i was hoping to upgrade my python3 branch with the latest changes
[17:38:38] DarkRift: and yeah, feels like it has too much magic behind that
[17:39:28] kinow: hmmm, last time I worked with selenium (1 year ago?) I created a base project and later publicized, https://github.com/kinow/selenium2-base
[17:39:41] kinow: maybe we could merge everything, and create a new repo somewhere
[17:39:51] kinow: and then I could continue to copy your ideas there hahaha
[17:39:58] Dude-X_: krosenvold, github/Selenium2/Selenium2 is not updating since Thursday. can you look into that?
[17:40:52] Dude-X_: kinow, github.com/Selenium2/Selenium2 is a mirror of the google code repo
[17:41:16] kinow: Dude-X hmm, let me check that, thanks :D
[17:41:32] Dude-X_: so i forked off of that to create the python3 repo
[17:41:43] DarkRift: kinow, that wouldn't fit here, we don't use maven
[17:41:56] kinow: DarkRift, good point
[17:42:07] kinow: neither does selenium, right? 
[17:42:19] kinow: I think it uses a different build system... not gradle
[17:42:24] DarkRift: and my framework already overcomes all you have there :P
[17:43:00] kinow: but my code is outdated, I bet you have some interesting code in your framework
[17:43:18] kinow: crazyfunbuild, that's the name
[17:43:35] DarkRift: yeah, and it doesn't work that well on windows
[17:43:53] DarkRift: Dude-X, you are the maintainer of python binding ?
[17:44:01] Dude-X_: automatedtester is
[17:44:09] Dude-X_: but i did a python3 port
[17:44:13] DarkRift: cool
[17:44:17] Dude-X_: and also a python2-3 port as well
[17:44:27] Dude-X_: so the same code works in both places
[17:44:35] DarkRift: that's good
[17:45:03] DarkRift: kinow, for the moment anyway the framework I've made is exclusively binded with the API I've created for our web application tests
[17:45:19] Dude-X_: god damn, neighbors fighting ferociously
[17:45:51] DarkRift: bbiab

[17:49:37] Dude-X_: crazyfunbuild likes to download the internet, and then compile everything
[17:49:42] Dude-X_: it's certainly crazy, but not fun
[17:51:14] Dude-X_: hmm once i upgrade to firefox10, the next thing to try out is native events enabled
[17:53:21] Dude-X_: hmm brits are having barbecues this weekend; i thought memorial day is an american thing; unless they're taking advantage of warm weather
[17:57:57] kinow: Dude-X, I tried to learn about selenium when I was using it, and thought about building from sources
[17:58:37] kinow: Although there's good documentation, I found crazy build quite complicated, but will give it another try this weekend 
[17:59:55] Dude-X_: they publish the jar to sci.lllicitonion.com

[18:00:06] Dude-X_: so don't bother building source unless you need a specific binding
[18:00:08] Dude-X_: 'like python

[22:52:29] kallisti_: Dude-X_: how's the Python 3 changes?
[22:54:05] Dude-X_: for now they're done
[22:54:14] Dude-X_: well, i have to checkout why some tests fail
[22:54:19] Dude-X_: but i suspect it's a timing issue
[22:55:57] dmachi has joined #selenium
[22:57:20] kallisti_: Dude-X_: problem with network latency?
[22:57:46] Dude-X_: probably the same issues why my tests flake on my project
[22:57:56] Dude-X_: err, actually not quite
[22:58:12] Dude-X_: most of the tests do raw findElements with no web driver waits
[IRC logfile - Started Sat May 26 23:00:20 2012]
[23:00:20] Dude-X_: kallisti_, the timing issues i don't mind but i do mind when profile and cookie tests fail
[23:00:41] kallisti_: Dude-X_: I just fixed most of my issues with that I believe.
[23:00:58] Dude-X_: i suspect that i get some issues because it uses ubuntu's modified firefox instead of the raw one
[23:04:14] Dude-X_: alright kallisti_ i'm going out; it's a nice summer-like day and my place is getting a tad warm
[23:04:54] Dude-X_: krosenvold, let me know when you get the git repo updated, it's still not updated.
