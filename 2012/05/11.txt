[08:59:49] Depado: Hello everyone, is there someone that can give me some tips about selenium rc usage ? =)
[IRC logfile - Started Fri May 11 09:01:48 2012]
[09:01:48] Depado: (Well you'll answer when you'll see it) So I have a Selenium RC running with Maven, a jetty container with my webapp deployed in it (it's an embded container), and I can test everything.
[09:02:41] Depado: Though I got some problems, I need to go faster. So here are my questions : How to hide (or not open at all) the RC window ? And how to stay in the same browser for different tests ?
[09:07:13] andreastt: Good mornin g(-:

[09:20:32] andreastt: Depado: I don't know RC, sorry.
[09:21:36] Depado: And do you know if there is a way to make user-extensions.js work with webdriver ?
[09:24:56] bsilwal has joined #selenium
[09:25:16] barancev: Depado: webdriver uses different internal architecture, you can't reuse user-extensions.js from RC, but of course webdriver is able to execute javascript, albeit in a different manner
[09:29:23] baijum has joined #selenium
[09:30:06] Depado: Because I have to use particular js file to use scLocator types (for smartgwt)...
[09:34:19] barancev: Depado: for webdriver, you have to reimplement use of scLocator types in the webdriver style
[09:34:34] Depado: Is this possible at least ?
[09:34:41] barancev: Depado: instead, may be you just ask your questions about RC? :)
[09:35:07] barancev: webdriver can do anything you want :)
[09:35:43] Depado: I just want it to make my tests more efficient. So is there a way to not open the selenium window while testing ? And is there a way to keep the browser open ?
[09:37:36] Binken_: htmlunit
[09:37:51] Binken_: :seen jimvans
[09:37:51] selbot2: I haven't seen jimvans.
[09:37:54] barancev: 1) to keeb the browser open just don't close it
[09:38:09] barancev: reuse the same selenium object for all the tests
[09:38:43] barancev: 2) what do you mean by "to not open selenium window"? the control window or the target window?
[09:38:58] Depado: That's what I do. But each time it meets an @Test anotation, it closes the browser and reopen it.
[09:39:38] barancev: use a static field, or implement a factory to manage your selenium instances
[09:39:51] Depado: Binken_: htmlunit is great. Though... I'm using selenium rc and it's not compatible with htmlunit. If I could make scLocators work with Webdriver, that would be perfect.
[09:40:34] barancev: I'm afraid you'll have problems with htmlunit+GWT :)
[09:40:56] barancev: don't be optimistic about htmlunit
[09:41:12] barancev: use Real Browsers
[09:41:46] Binken_: +1 barancev
[09:42:46] Depado: Htmlunit can emulate firefox without graphical interface, so where is the problem ? :x
[09:43:50] Depado: Well anyway if there could be some problems with htmlunit, there is no advantage to go on Webdriver, I'll lost a week to configure it (yeah I already did that...)
[09:46:08] barancev: Depado: DOM emulation is good enough in htmlunit, that's true, but js engine is still rhino
[09:46:22] Depado: Yeah right.
[09:47:59] Depado: So in my test I create a static DefaultSelenium instance. @BeforeClass is executed only once and it's not depending on how many tests there are in my class, is it ?
[09:48:42] barancev: true
[09:49:27] Ammar01 has joined #selenium
[09:50:27] Depado: Can I show you my code so you can tell me what I'm doing wrong ? It still open a firefox, execute a test, kill the firefox, open a firefox, execute the other test and kill the firefox.

[12:21:09] andreastt: The Selenium test suite appears to be reusing the same profile for Opera every time.
[12:21:24] andreastt: So whenever a @NeedsFreshDriver annotation is added before a test, that Opera instance won't actually be fresh.
[12:21:31] andreastt: Any idea where I should look?
[12:22:00] AutomatedTester: andreastt: it *used* to be in the test project
[12:22:08] AutomatedTester: something about environment
[12:22:50] andreastt: I have a suspicion that the same capabilities set is being stored in the Supplier somewhere.
[12:24:54] barancev has joined #selenium
[12:24:54] selbot2: barancev: note from simonstewart 44 minutes ago: Thanks for going through the issues list last night 
[12:25:27] dawagner: andreastt: SeleniumTestRunner
[12:25:50] dawagner: The withFreshDriver method
[12:26:19] andreastt: That fetches it from the storage in JUnit4TestBase.
[12:26:24] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[12:26:52] andreastt: It's not actually a fresh driver if it's using the same capabilities?
[12:28:01] simonstewart: andreastt: same capabilities just implies same config, not the same browser instance
[12:28:29] andreastt: But if you have an OperaProfile stored in capabilities, that will get reused?
[12:28:39] simonstewart: Presumably
[12:28:47] simonstewart: I rewrote the FirefoxProfile to survive this
[12:28:54] dawagner: Yes, but we presumably don't actually set the profile?
[12:28:59] barancev: new IEDriverServer sometimes crashes on quit()
[12:29:02] simonstewart: So you can use a FirefoxProfile numerous times, and each time get a fresh profile
[12:29:10] andreastt: dawagner: I'm unsure what happens TBH.
[12:29:13] barancev: Unhandled exception at 0x77c915de in IEDriverServer.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x67ba8470.
[12:29:40] andreastt: I guess the question is whether we take the capabilities we get back from the driver and put it in that storage or not.
[12:29:50] andreastt: If we do, we're going to reuse the same OperaProfile.
[12:30:02] andreastt: Because OperaDriver sends you back the actual profile you're using in capabilities.
[12:31:12] jarib: krosenvold, nirvdrum: can I override the firefox socket lock implementation in a grid node?
[12:31:49] simonstewart: andreastt: the capabilities from "getCapabilities" do not need to be the same as those sent to the constructor
[12:32:06] simonstewart: The latter is a "in the ideal world, I want one of these" and the former is a "this is what you've got"
[12:32:09] nirvdrum: jarib: Sorry for my ignorance.  How is that typically done?
[12:32:20] andreastt: simonstewart: Which is another way of saying what I just said?
[12:32:58] jarib: nirvdrum: i haven't done this in java before, but I think it's by overriding FirefoxDriver.obtainLock()
[12:33:13] simonstewart: Possibly. Not quite sure what you meant by "put it in storage"
[12:33:47] nirvdrum: jarib: In general, if you can do it with RemoteWebDriver, you can do it with grid.
[12:33:57] nirvdrum: If you find otherwise, I consider it a bug.
[12:34:01] andreastt: I'm talking about ThreadLocal<WebDriver> storedDriver in JUnit4TestBase
[12:35:34] moo-_- has joined #selenium
[12:35:42] jarib: nirvdrum: the idea is to scale up the number of firefoxes per node by removing the socket lock (which is used to find ports for the server in firefox)
[12:35:49] simonstewart: Ahhh... that's the instance we reuse unless the test declares that it needs a fresh instance
[12:35:58] jarib: so the approach is to have a per-machine pool of ports
[12:36:04] andreastt: But aren't we reusing it anyhow?
[12:36:14] simonstewart: Yes, we reuse it by default
[12:36:20] andreastt: Anyways, that wasn't the problem though.  I think I need to investigate further.
[12:36:21] nirvdrum: jarib: krosenvold would probably be better equipped to answer that I guess.  I typically cap out at 3 browsers per node just because EC2 I/O kinda sucks.
[12:36:22] simonstewart: Unless the test is marked
[12:36:34] simonstewart: with @NoDriverAftertest or @NeedsFreshDriver
[12:36:52] simonstewart: in which case we new up an instance of a driver
[12:36:56] simonstewart: and store that
[12:37:01] jarib: nirvdrum: i'd be interested to know what symptoms you saw that made you cap at 3
[12:37:24] jarib: i'm hoping to do ~48 per machine 
[12:37:56] AutomatedTester: jarib: what manner of machine do you have that can handle 48 browsers
[12:38:02] nirvdrum: jarib: I think I get 2.5 cores.  I found one browser being driven would tax that core.  Keep in mind this is on RC though.  WD should be faster, so I need to do more load testing.
[12:38:12] nirvdrum: jarib: And I could run more, but performance dropped off.
[12:39:22] jarib: AutomatedTester: they're 24-core, Xeon X5650 2.67GHz CPUs, 48GB RAM
[12:39:37] nirvdrum: jarib: Nice.
[12:39:41] AutomatedTester: thats nice
[12:39:42] nirvdrum: I need to get a few of those :-P
[12:39:46] jarib: :)
[12:40:11] AutomatedTester: I would have thought that realistic you would only get 24 before you saw performance dropping
[12:40:14] AutomatedTester: a browser per core
[12:40:58] jarib: on the older server we're running on now, we didn't spike the 16 cores with 16 browsers
[12:41:07] jarib: it's running 32 atm
[12:41:21] jarib: we'll see. 
[12:41:50] AutomatedTester: jarib: you have the data, I can't argue :)
[12:43:08] jarib: main issue was port exhaustion and the socket lock
[12:43:25] simonstewart: Lunch!
[12:43:43] jarib: but back then i handled that in ruby, now i have to do it in java :P
[12:57:25] jarib: hm. looks like i need to override FirefoxDriver.connectTo and write my own ExtensionConnection to set the port

[14:07:51] barancev: wait.until(textToBePresentInElement(By.id("myelem"), "expected text"));
[14:08:00] barancev: that's not bad
[14:08:17] barancev: java is wordy, anyway

[15:13:07] simonstewart: Was wondering if you wanted me to say anything about your workshop?
[15:13:13] Dude-X: the interesting thing about chinese numbers is that they're written in a way so that people can't easily change them to another number, like a 1 becoming a 4 by adding two lines
[15:13:43] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Sure.  When do you think you'll have the post live?  I need to get the materials online still.
[15:13:57] simonstewart: Ping me anything you want, when you want :)
[15:14:04] nirvdrum: I was actually hoping to get access to the SeleniumHQ GitHub account, but I think Paul is the only admin.
[15:14:20] simonstewart: I may have the keys too
[15:14:23] simonstewart: lemme check
[15:15:04] nirvdrum: Francois and I wanted to get some general grid stuff up there.  E.g., a Sauce connector.  Wouldn't really fit in core, but would be great to have in a community resource section.
[15:15:10] nirvdrum: krosenvold was looking for access as well.
[15:15:33] simonstewart: Project hosting is done on GC, though we'll certainly mirror up to github
[15:15:47] simonstewart: What we need is krosenvold to give me the nod about migrating to git :)
[15:16:30] nirvdrum: Even third party stuff?
[15:16:43] simonstewart: "It depends"
[15:16:52] simonstewart: The sauce connector sounds like something that Sauce should be hosting
[15:17:09] simonstewart: You know, for when you get bored of maintaining it :)
[15:17:14] nirvdrum: Heh.
[15:17:24] simonstewart: Or am I missing something very obvious?
[15:17:24] nirvdrum: Well, Santi should be doing the bulk of the work.
[15:17:29] simonstewart: ha!
[15:17:42] nirvdrum: I've been working up a BrowserMob Proxy connector, too.
[15:17:47] simonstewart: I humbly suggest it's sauce's problem
[15:17:56] simonstewart: I've got the commit bit for the browsermob proxy
[15:18:26] nirvdrum: That's fine.  It was more a case of "here's how you should build a proxy, and it's actually a useful example"
[15:19:37] nirvdrum: So, a repo that serves both as examples of how to extend grid and provide functional utility.
[15:19:48] nirvdrum: Another was Francois's stuff for managing VMWare.
[15:19:50] simonstewart: https://github.com/webmetrics/browsermob-proxy/blob/master/src/main/java/org/browsermob/proxy/ProxyServer.java#L66
[15:20:14] simonstewart: Ahh... you're not talking about an HTTP proxy?
[15:20:19] nirvdrum: No.  Sorry.
[15:20:22] nirvdrum: Loaded term.
[15:20:38] nirvdrum: Grid's concept of a proxy.  The interface the hub uses to communicate with a node.
[15:20:47] nirvdrum: That's where the bulk of grid customization occurs.
[15:20:53] simonstewart: So here's the problem
[15:21:01] nirvdrum: We provide a pretty useful default.
[15:21:06] simonstewart: The main project is hosted on Google Code
[15:21:09] nirvdrum: But, it won't ever work for everyone.
[15:21:26] simonstewart: When we make the move to git, we'll still be hosted on Google Code
[15:21:34] simonstewart: And that will be the primary reop
[15:21:37] simonstewart: repo
[15:21:39] llaskin: jarib: u here?
[15:21:44] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Understood.
[15:21:48] simonstewart: we might mirror up to github, but that would be a secondary repo
[15:21:49] hourback has joined #selenium
[15:22:08] simonstewart: If we do that, it'll definitely be under the SeleniumHQ user
[15:22:25] llaskin: i'm having a wierd situation where for SOME reason, a find_element call is returning an array
[15:22:29] llaskin: any idea why that might/could happen?
[15:22:35] simonstewart: If we start pushing extra bits into that github repo, we muddy the waters
[15:22:40] simonstewart: Where's the code hosted?
[15:22:41] nirvdrum: Ahh.
[15:22:49] nirvdrum: Fair enough.
[15:23:00] simonstewart: If we move wholesale to github, then I suspect that my corporate paymasters may not be terribly impressed
[15:23:04] nirvdrum: Heh.
[15:23:05] simonstewart: (though I can always ask)
[15:23:15] llaskin: hah
[15:23:18] nirvdrum: I'm not advocating that.
[15:23:30] nirvdrum: There's already a couple projects under that organization, FYI.
[15:23:34] nirvdrum: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ
[15:23:36] simonstewart: I know
[15:23:41] nirvdrum: So maybe you'll have to work that out with Paul.
[15:23:54] simonstewart: Fluent-selenium is his baby
[15:24:01] nirvdrum: I thought it was to be a community repository of random junk that didn't fit into Selenium proper.
[15:24:03] Roacer: why would I get a "no such element exception" when I copied the locator from the IDE, where it works fine?
[15:24:09] simonstewart: heh
[15:24:14] simonstewart: it could well end up being that
[15:24:41] simonstewart: the swivel-eyed, foam mouthed git zealots often seem to believe that there's only one place hosting git
[15:24:47] nirvdrum: You run into a similar confusion even if we started them all on GC and synced back to GitHub, I'd imagine.  Since you still have disparate repos on GC.
[15:25:08] simonstewart: Disparate repos? We're migrating the project history into git
[15:25:18] simonstewart: the git repo will be the canonical one
[15:25:44] nirvdrum: Let's say there's a hypothetical repo called "selenium-grid-extensions"
[15:26:02] simonstewart: How urgent is this?
[15:26:06] nirvdrum: I imagine you'd slap me if I tried to add that to selenium code tree.
[15:26:14] nirvdrum: So, it needs to go somewhere else :-P
[15:26:25] nirvdrum: Not terribly urgent.  I was just going to put the workshop code up.
[15:26:27] simonstewart: you're making a good case for github
[15:26:31] simonstewart: k
[15:26:48] simonstewart: let's get the migration to git done for the main project, and circle back
[15:26:54] simonstewart: (hopefully, that'll be RSN)
[15:26:57] nirvdrum: Sounds good.
[15:27:11] simonstewart: Thanks for being patient with a curmudgeon :)
[15:27:21] nirvdrum: Trust me, I'm not trying to pick a fight about GitHub.  I just don't want to point people one place only to move it in a couple months.
[15:27:40] simonstewart: understood
[15:27:51] nirvdrum: krosenvold needs to stop being so lazy.
[15:27:57] simonstewart: (TBH, I have no idea if one project in GC can have multiple repos)
[15:28:06] simonstewart: ping krosenvold :)

[16:03:29] simonstewart: You could take a look at clojure or scala
[16:03:35] simonstewart: Both of those are pretty acceptable
[16:03:53] mikeheme has joined #selenium
[16:04:26] barancev: yahoo!!!
[16:04:27] Dude-X: i think i like Clojure better. Scala seems a bit too dense
[16:04:33] Roacer: or do it like me, haskell to melt down your brain :D
[16:04:45] simonstewart: Agreed
[16:05:10] llaskin: yea, you're a glutton for punishment
[16:05:16] llaskin: haskell, jeezus
[16:05:17] llaskin: why
[16:05:18] Dude-X: anyway at the moment I am learning Objective C. That language seems like a nicer version of C in terms of managing pointer stuff. But the dynamic side of it is a bit scary.
[16:05:33] Roacer: llaskin: I like it?
[16:05:36] simonstewart: That's the best thing about Objective C
[16:05:43] simonstewart: It's a proper message passing OO language
[16:05:50] simonstewart: bliss
[16:06:05] Roacer: llaskin: and if it compiles it most likely does what you intended to do :)
[16:06:06] nirvdrum: It strikes me as weird that it's reference counted but you still need to drain the pool.
[16:06:20] nirvdrum: C++ smart pointers seem safer in that regard.
[16:06:51] Roacer: obj-c is just plain nasty, just have a look at the code, brackets everywhere ….
[16:07:27] Roacer: like LISP with brackets :D
[16:07:29] nirvdrum: I loved ML, so Scala is kinda nice to me.  I disliked Lisp, so Clojure is not nice to me :-P
[16:07:49] Roacer: obj-c is lost in silly brackets :D
[16:07:53] Dude-X: i am going to check out the book "The Land of Lisp" 
[16:08:04] simonstewart: Javascript == Scheme
[16:08:09] Dude-X: one bad thing about obj c is no funciton overloading
[16:08:10] simonstewart: Bwahahahaha!
[16:08:14] Roacer: scheme == lisp
[16:08:19] Dude-X: but python doesn't have that either
[16:08:38] Roacer: haskell, no need to overload ;)
[16:08:40] Dude-X: but you do get long method names in objective C (whih is okay0
[16:09:30] Dude-X: [UIColor getRed: 8.0 green: 0.0 blue: 0.0 alpha: 128]
[16:10:21] Roacer: anyway, I gotta go, I might be back over the weekend, or at last on monday when I have to work on these tests again :D
[16:10:28] lukeis: i always struggle with what to call the first one... cause to me that should be the method name and not really related to the argument passed :-/
[16:10:43] sumxyz has joined #selenium
[16:11:08] Dude-X: well the method name is a methodname but usuualy include the first argument name
[16:11:24] lukeis: yeah... to me they should have been separate
[16:11:24] Dude-X: that's the convention
[16:11:49] Dude-X: it probably has to do with the lack of namespaces in Obj-C

[16:56:33] lukeis: nope :)
[16:56:42] lukeis: that's what building off trunk is for ;)
[16:57:12] adamgoucher: using an embedded interpretor for this so recompiling isnt an option. guess i'm downgrading...

[18:36:06] barancev: what if we enable them?

[20:20:51] jimevans: who's proficient with the atoms?
[20:21:20] AutomatedTester: jimevans: i am sure I can help
[20:21:30] AutomatedTester: if you answer my question first...
[20:21:46] jimevans: okay, fire away.
[20:22:06] AutomatedTester: does the IEDriver Server work exactly the same as the ChromeDriver?
[20:22:38] jimevans: *exactly*? no. mostly, yes. it doesn't support the same logging switches as chromedriver.exe does.
[20:23:18] jimevans: in fact, in the .net bindings (java too, now i believe) there is a common "DriverService" class from which ChromeDriverService and InternetExplorerDriverService descend.
[20:24:09] jimevans: so the short answer is, it should act the same way, in all the ways that *really* matter.
[20:24:58] AutomatedTester: i suspect what is in my head is going to work
[20:25:03] AutomatedTester: ok, whats your question
[20:25:23] jimevans: well, i don't really have a question, per se…
[20:25:53] jimevans: i've been working on implementing synthetic events for IE (to shut up those who keep bitching about the behavior of native events)
[20:26:22] jimevans: and to that end, i'm using bot.Mouse.
[20:26:50] jimevans: which works okay in my testing, unless you're trying to use a page that has *ptui* jQuery on it.
[20:26:57] jimevans: drag-drop won't work there.
[20:27:19] jimevans: however, the same code works just fine in firefox.
[20:27:21] barancev: java implementation is not perfect yet, it creates the same set of command line switches for IE and chrome, this method should be implemented in each class independently
[20:27:46] jimevans: and by same code, i mean same javascript code.
[20:28:14] jimevans: so i have a reproducible case, using javascript only, and even using the atoms test framework.
[20:28:23] jimevans: but i'm at my wits end about it.
[20:28:42] lukeis: heh, you expect the same javascript to work in IE and FF... you've worked in web apps before right? ;)
[20:29:05] jimevans: i don't expect the same javascript to work; i expect the same *webdriver* *atoms* code to work.
[20:29:27] jimevans: we're supposed to be smart enough to figure out all and abstract away all these browser differences. :)
[20:29:39] jimevans: let me check in what i've got first.
[20:29:42] lukeis: that's what jQuery is for 0_o
[20:29:49] jimevans: :-P
[20:30:44] jimevans: if jquery was the only one out there, i'd accept that as an answer. unfortunately, it's not the only JS framework. but you knew that already. :)
[20:31:29] lukeis: yup... wrote my own first... stumbled upon prototype, and have used dojo and YUI too before... and finally using jQuery :)

[20:42:13] Dude-X: would that affect linux installs?
[20:42:16] barancev: to 12? why not 10 ESR?
[20:42:35] AutomatedTester: because 10 ESR is intended for enterprise users
[20:42:52] AutomatedTester: well thats my understanding
[20:42:58] Dude-X: 10esr is for large organizations that require a stable app platform
[20:43:00] AutomatedTester: I am just an engineer, what do i know :)
[20:43:39] barancev: I bet 3.6 is used in enterprize primarily
[20:43:59] jleyba_: AutomatedTester: So what's going to be  the oldest version of Firefox supported by WebDriver?  3.6 or 10 ESR?
[20:44:29] AutomatedTester: jleyba_: i say that from 2.22 we do 10
[20:44:46] AutomatedTester: but Simon and Google Test Managers may have other ideas
[20:45:04] jleyba_: Oh right.. Forgot about that
[20:45:14] barancev: 3.6 has no memory leaks, btw
[20:45:18] Dude-X: most the projects that use webdriver at my company use ff3.6
[20:45:25] barancev: unlike 4+
[20:45:28] AutomatedTester: jleyba_: I have suggested we drop a whole bunch of versions before but Simon said no

[20:46:47] jleyba_: of course, the FirefoxDriver has some nasty memory leaks as well
[20:46:54] jleyba_: but no one complains, so no one fixes them :)

[20:51:29] AutomatedTester: jleyba_: https://twitter.com/#!/AutomatedTester/status/200934801623097345
[20:52:11] jleyba_: Is that the python suite?
[20:52:25] jleyba_: The java suite has 600+ tests in it
[20:53:08] AutomatedTester: thats the python suite
[20:53:13] AutomatedTester: I need to update them
[20:53:22] AutomatedTester: my next tweet says that :D
[20:53:42] jleyba_: Are you using WebSockets?
[20:54:17] AutomatedTester: jleyba_: nope
[20:54:23] AutomatedTester: normal sockets
[20:54:59] jimevans: AutomatedTester: what's the transport protocol? http, or something else?
[20:55:08] AutomatedTester: jimevans: tcp
[20:55:29] AutomatedTester: you can telnet into the browser
[20:55:40] jleyba_: I've been itching to convert the FirefoxDriver to WebSockets.  The SafariDriver is noticeably faster since it keeps a single connection for the entire session
[20:55:40] AutomatedTester: so we just send messages via a socket
[20:55:52] barancev: AutomatedTester: which version is going to be leak-free?
[20:55:58] jimevans: AutomatedTester: shiny.
[20:56:11] AutomatedTester: barancev: definitely 15
[20:56:13] jimevans: what's the format of the messages, then? raw json?
[20:56:38] santiycr: jleyba: how about moving RemoteDriver to a single-connection protocol? ;)
[20:56:53] Dude-X: jleyba: have you tried throwing a monkey wrench in the connection to see what happens?
[20:57:47] santiycr: jleyba: that's actually something I have in my "once I get 2 days free" list
[20:57:48] AutomatedTester: jleyba_: I wanted to make the firefoxdriver websockets to get it working on Fennec
[20:57:49] jleyba_: Dude-X: If the connection closes, the SafariDriver just sits there waiting for a new one. It maintains a single session independently of the socket.  The client is dumb though and will crap out on you if the connection dies
[20:57:49] emil_temp_nick has joined #selenium
[20:57:50] jimevans: or i suppose a raw socket would do, but pipes are sooo much easier to work with.
[20:58:15] emil_temp_nick: hi all, is there any material on Webdriver LOAD testing?
[20:58:39] jleyba_: jimevans: If you want to make your eyes hurt, you should look at the IPC mechanism ChromeDriver uses for Chrome
[20:58:57] jimevans: emil_temp_nick: i maintain that webdriver is not the correct tool for load testing. others may disagree, but you'd be hard-pressed to persuade me otherwise.
[20:59:11] jimevans: jleyba_: i'll pass, thanks. :)
[20:59:53] jimevans: i think the command id introduced by the safari driver should be baked into the base json wire protocol
[IRC logfile - Started Fri May 11 21:00:16 2012]
[21:00:16] jimevans: even if other implementations never use it.
[21:00:27] jarib: why?
[21:00:39] jleyba_: The json wire protocol is http, so the id is just inherent to the connection
[21:00:42] jimevans: my own personal code hell.
[21:00:51] jleyba_: We could add it to the general spec though
[21:01:06] emil_temp_nick: jimevans: despite any short comings,  i would like to check it out. 
[21:01:19] jimevans: jarib: because of the json library i use in the .net bindings. it makes my class structure less elegant than i want.
[21:01:48] jarib: hehe
[21:02:28] jleyba_: jimevans: You can ignore the command ID if you want. The safaridriver is pretty good about keeping things synchronized.  It's mainly a debugging aid for me
[21:02:31] jimevans: given the emergence of the safari driver, i'm seeing less of a need for a multitude of http endpoints for the protocol. but i'm not the architect around her.
[21:02:34] algard: emil_temp_nick, BrowserMob is a company that uses WD for load testing, might want to check them out for some examples etc
[21:02:36] jimevans: s/her/here.
[21:02:56] jimevans: jleyba_: good to know.
[21:03:26] jimevans: i was simply trying to follow the (very thorough, and easy to follow, imo) implementation instructions in the wiki. :)
[21:04:02] jimevans: that's not sarcasm, by the way. i really thought the client-side implementation instructions were very well done, jleyba_
[21:04:21] emil_temp_nick: algard, tnx
[21:05:47] jleyba_: jimevans: Sorry, let me backtrack.  The command ID cannot be ignored.  The only reason the client-side code needs to mess with it though is b/c the SafariDriver uses the same message format for all messages
[21:06:15] jleyba_: And that ID is used when passing commands from the extension to an injected script
[21:07:07] moo has joined #selenium
[21:07:17] jibay has joined #selenium
[21:07:56] jimevans: right. i see. and needing to inject that id into my beautiful, pristine Command object is what makes my inheritance tree a bitch, and which would be unnecessary if the id were part of the base protocol. :) but i'm just being whiney. all-in-all, it's really not that big a deal to me.
[21:08:08] dawagner: That whole multi-process thing is a great idea, but a single javascript thread can still lock up the whole of chrome :(
[21:08:43] jleyba_: dawagner: that's b/c chrome follows convention and runs js in the UI thread.  which sucks monkey balls

[21:39:58] lukeis: all versions of IE have said problem?
[21:40:22] jimevans: lukeis: now you're just being difficult. :)
[21:40:38] jimevans: i don't have access to my normal testing environments at the moment.
[21:40:38] lukeis: err, what version did you see it in then ;)
[21:40:46] jimevans: saw the problem in IE9.
[21:40:48] lukeis: k
[21:40:58] jimevans: compare to firefox.
[21:41:04] lukeis: 12?
[21:41:29] jimevans: actually, i thought it was, but it's 11.
[21:41:53] lukeis: k
[21:42:00] lukeis: should be the same though
[21:42:23] jimevans: firefox behavior == google chrome (latest, stable channel) behavior
[21:42:49] jimevans: we checked in native event support for firefox 12, no?
[21:43:08] lukeis: i thought so, but eranm would know best ;)
[21:43:35] jimevans: well, i suppose i should be more specific: native event support for firefox 12 on windows, that is. :)

[21:45:32] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: did I do that?
[21:45:55] AutomatedTester: and Dude-X I released on Monday
[21:46:54] jimevans: lukeis: aha! my hypothesis is that it's IE9-specific.

[21:47:21] lukeis: had to update my working copy, about to test ;)
[21:47:26] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: that should give a compile error you're right

[21:53:14] Dude-X: okay i know how how to crash webdriver now; switch to an iframe, fail to locate an element, in your exception handling call getCurrentURL
[21:53:57] Dude-X: this is with java webdriver 2.17, ff10 
[21:54:48] farlan has left #selenium
[21:55:15] Dude-X: this also happens with the latest revision 168xx
[21:55:22] Dude-X: so it's an old obscure bug
[21:55:27] Dude-X: it seems to happen with FF10
[21:55:35] jimevans: Dude-X: does it take down the JVM?
[21:55:55] jimevans: or just give you an unhandled exception
[21:56:06] jibay has joined #selenium
[21:56:07] Dude-X: doesn't take down the JVM but rather it crashes the webdriver xpi?, so any subsequent calls to driver won't work and respond with URI error
[21:56:34] lukeis: jimevans: ok... so that passed for me in IE9
[21:56:46] jimevans: really? hmm...
[21:56:48] Dude-X: Component reuturned failure code: NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER [nsIDOMLocation.toString]
[21:57:01] jimevans: so it drags the box over into the target.
[21:57:07] lukeis: compatability mode?
[21:57:08] lukeis: yep
[21:57:18] jimevans: no, i'm not doing anything that silly.
[21:57:35] lukeis: i'll try in other versions of IE
[21:58:38] jimevans: for me, in IE9, the damned thing stubbornly refuses to move!

[22:38:38] barancev: ok
[22:39:47] barancev: what about "non-SFC copyrights"? should they be changed to SFC? or may be there are some parts under different copyright?
[22:46:12] lukeis: jimevans: not that this fixes anything... but i noticed the mouseUp is sent to the drop div instead of the dragged div, i'll have to double check what actually happens but i would think the thing that got dragged would get the up (well, technically whatever has the highest z-index in the coords the mouse is at)
