[13:59:52] ammar_: hello - does anyone have advice on how best to use python with selenium webdriver? should I be trying to look for/use a Cucumber equivalent or just use write python code directly? 
[IRC logfile - Started Sat May 19 14:09:02 2012]
[14:09:02] llaskin: ammar_: both options work though i think the latter is preferred?
[14:11:22] ammar_: thanks llaskin - i'll stick with writing the code directly then (found a Cucumber variant called Freshen which is a plugin to Nose but it doesn't support Selenium)

[15:31:39] KebabBob: I'm trying out webdriver and running on centos and webdriver.Firefox() just seems to hang, without opening the browser.
[15:31:53] KebabBob: Using the python API btw....
[15:32:31] KebabBob: Docs are pretty sparse so I thought I'd ask here, how I can get it working :)
[15:36:12] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[15:36:58] KebabBob: Oh... and somehow selenium ide manages to crash my nvidia drivers
[15:43:12] testingb0t1: maybe you need a new computer :p
[15:43:30] KebabBob: Perhaps...
[15:44:03] KebabBob: btw the ide is on win7, webdriver I'm trying to run on centos because it looks like webdriver doesn't like the latest firefox version I have on my win7 computer
[15:44:24] KebabBob: Can't get it to hover over an element (to make the element visible)
[15:46:03] KebabBob: 'Cannot perform native interaction: Could not load native...'
[15:50:26] kallisti: hm, maybe the problem with my profile zip code is the base64 encoding.

[16:33:45] llaskin: KebabBob: webdriver has no problems with any versions of FF that are currently on the release channel AFAIK
[16:34:00] KebabBob: hmm.. odd
[16:34:02] llaskin: have you tried running the examples provided on the seleniumhq website?
[16:34:05] llaskin: what version are you on?
[16:34:18] llaskin: (btw, i run webdriver, using ruby, on win7 with ff11 and 12 regularly...as in right now)
[16:34:20] KebabBob: I got this exception when running on firefox, but when I tried chrome it worked fine there
[16:34:34] KebabBob: I just changed the driver and it worked perfect on chrome
[16:35:01] llaskin: what exception?
[16:35:09] llaskin: :gist it
[16:35:10] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[16:35:52] KebabBob: http://pastebin.com/dg4Vgeur
[16:36:19] KebabBob: Cannot perform native interaction: Could not load native events component.
[16:36:30] llaskin: what version of FF?
[16:36:41] KebabBob: 12
[16:36:44] llaskin: and win7?
[16:36:51] KebabBob: err... professional I believe
[16:36:53] KebabBob: Yeah, win7
[16:37:10] llaskin: i am pretty sure native events has no problems in win7 and ff12
[16:37:12] KebabBob: Just downloaded selenium today, so I'm running latest version of everything afai
[16:37:20] KebabBob: Well looks like it does for me :)
[16:37:21] llaskin: i would assume selenium 2.21 ?
[16:37:29] llaskin: hahaha
[16:37:31] llaskin: yes i understand
[16:37:45] llaskin: you're saying that it hangs on webdriver.firefox?
[16:37:49] llaskin: i dunno anything about centOS sorry
[16:37:53] llaskin: (nor python)
[16:37:58] llaskin: and its saturday..so most of the guys are out and about....
[16:38:22] KebabBob: Nope that was another error :) That was when I was trying to run everything on linux (older ff version) since win7 and ff12 wasn't behaving
[16:38:36] Dude-X_: KebabBob, try doing p = webdriver.FirefoxProfile()
[16:38:47] llaskin: aaah i lied...dude-x also has no life:-P
[16:39:01] KebabBob: But this is pretty much moot (for me), I just used chrome instead
[16:39:02] llaskin: Dude-X know anythign about native events in ff12 having issues?
[16:39:03] Dude-X_: it's morning in the east coast!
[16:39:04] Dude-X_: :D
[16:39:09] llaskin: 11:38 is NOT morning
[16:39:15] llaskin: u know i'm in boston...that don't fly with me
[16:39:19] Dude-X_: yes native events is not well supported until 2.22 is out
[16:39:19] KebabBob: lol
[16:39:25] llaskin: oh really dude?
[16:39:27] llaskin: interesting
[16:39:38] llaskin: well KebabBob, you can build 2.22 from the source if you want...
[16:39:43] llaskin: cuz its *this* close to being released
[16:39:47] llaskin: i am assuming next wk
[16:39:55] KebabBob: Nah, It's not really an issue anymore since I just used chrome and it works fine there
[16:40:06] llaskin: so what is your question then?
[16:40:33] KebabBob: The question has been resolved - I don't have it anymore
[16:40:39] llaskin: aaah ok:)
[16:40:39] KebabBob: I was just explaining the problem since you asked :)
[16:40:41] llaskin: glad we can help:)
[16:40:59] Dude-X_: you can disable native events though
[16:40:59] KebabBob: Yeah, I appreciate it :)
[16:41:35] KebabBob: Yeah I'll just update when 2.22 is out
[16:42:21] MadMerlin|work has joined #selenium
[16:43:00] Dude-X_: i think 2.22 is close to coming out
[16:44:26] llaskin: i expect next week
[16:44:36] llaskin: *in no way is this a volunteer to take the turkey bacon*
[16:54:10] Dude-X_: heh
[16:54:27] Dude-X_: i am waiting for 2.22 to come out so i can upgrade from 2.17 to 2.22
[16:55:25] llaskin: i've been following each version
[16:55:29] llaskin: i had a problem at ~2.16
[16:55:35] llaskin: since then its been mostly smooth sailin
[16:57:00] Dude-X_: i would have gone to 2.20 
[16:57:10] Dude-X_: but alert handling is still flakey
[16:57:19] llaskin: 2.22 will fix that too
[16:57:25] Dude-X_: but i solved most of my problems by disabling alerts with javascript

[19:07:42] nirvdrum: Does anyone here know how to compile the IE driver within Visual Studio?
[19:10:21] barancev: nirvdrum: open VS command prompt and run 'go release'
[19:10:48] barancev: or, in VS -- just build the solution
[19:10:55] nirvdrum: I can't find the SLN file.
[19:11:02] nirvdrum: All I see is the vcproj.
[19:11:50] barancev: WebDriver.sln in the root directory
[19:12:04] nirvdrum: Heh.  That was easy.
[19:12:07] nirvdrum: Thanks.
[19:12:18] nirvdrum: I tried to open just the DLL project.
[19:12:36] barancev: it is included in the solution
[19:13:16] nirvdrum: And thanks for the tip on the VS command prompt.

[19:31:45] nirvdrum: barancev: I see 21 projects build successfully, 4 fail.
[19:31:59] nirvdrum: I assume they should all pass, but do you see the same?
[19:47:21] barancev: "6 succeeded, 0 failed, 19 skipped" for Release win32 
[19:48:44] barancev: sorry -- it's for x64
[19:48:48] nirvdrum: Looks like it might be because I'm on a 32-bit system.
[19:48:49] nirvdrum: Yeah.
[19:49:05] barancev: "11 succeeded, 0 failed, 14 skipped" for Release win32
[19:49:44] barancev: others are .Net (tests, .net binding etc)
[19:49:58] nirvdrum: But I guess I can't build the IEDriverServer project without x64, so that kinda blows.
[19:50:01] barancev: I'm on win7 x64
[19:50:45] barancev: sorry can't try win32 atm, at home I have no win32 pc
[19:51:42] nirvdrum: No problem.
[19:51:46] nirvdrum: I'm on a 32-bit Win XP VM at the moment.
[19:52:01] nirvdrum: It seems _WIN64 is set somehow, when it shouldn't be.
[19:52:08] nirvdrum: I'll have to track that down.
[IRC logfile - Started Sat May 19 20:03:10 2012]
[20:03:10] nirvdrum: Okay.  Build target was set to x64.  I didn't realize that was a VS macro and not a platform SDK thing.
[20:03:14] nirvdrum: Looking good now.
