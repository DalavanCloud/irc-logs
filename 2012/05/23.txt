[00:00:29] stephend: iirc, santiycr, we OOM'd you guys @ Sauce a year or so ago with this very testsuite :-)
[00:00:54] nirvdrum: Not that I'm aware of.  But the Selenium RC server (what the node uses) leaks pretty badly on its own.
[00:01:03] stephend: nirvdrum: or, what to grep for, for more serious problems?
[00:01:06] stephend: oh, didn't know that
[00:01:19] nirvdrum: Yeah.  I've taken to just rebooting my nodes.
[00:01:33] stephend: :-(
[00:01:39] stephend: that's what we're doing too, but it sucks
[00:01:49] stephend: thankfully we're also looking at ESX on-demand
[00:01:51] nirvdrum: The RC server uses some old version of Jetty 5 that predates the JVM locking down its memory model.
[00:02:01] stephend: I thought they upgraded, recently?
[00:02:14] nirvdrum: The hub uses Jetty 7.
[00:02:17] stephend: kristian, I mean
[00:02:19] stephend: ahhh, I see
[00:02:22] stephend: damn
[00:02:36] stephend: we're almost done with RC, thank God
[00:02:41] stephend: got, I think, one more suite to go
[00:02:46] nirvdrum: He has a branch where the RC server uses Java 7, but the proxy support doesn't work in it, meaning it can't land in trunk without breaking RC.
[00:02:52] stephend: something else quick: Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.remote.ErrorHandler$UnknownServerException
[00:02:56] nirvdrum: I'm going to spend some time trying to make that work.
[00:03:04] stephend: the wording on that makes me think it's pretty bad, or could add up to be
[00:03:11] stephend: cool
[00:03:12] santiycr: I wouldn't be surprised it happened on sauce
[00:03:16] nirvdrum: stephend: It wouldn't matter a ton.  RWD uses the same server.
[00:03:28] stephend: oh
[00:03:30] santiycr: I've seen users run a single session nonstop on pretty complex sites for over 45 minutes
[00:03:33] stephend: boy, this is so informative
[00:03:44] stephend: actually, the channel already does :-)
[00:03:54] santiycr: our vms have ~1GB, depending on the OS
[00:04:05] stephend: santiycr: that was a while ago, no problems with sauce in 4ever
[00:04:11] nirvdrum: stephend: What I saw happening was related to many sessions happening on the same node.  I'm pretty sure that version of Jetty leaks its thread pool.
[00:04:20] stephend: just saying that we have a good/bad testsuite here that seems to kill memory :-(
[00:04:26] stephend: nirvdrum: we have a ton
[00:04:33] stephend: yikes
[00:04:44] stephend: 6 mac minis, with tests going on all the time
[00:04:45] nirvdrum: I had configured it to cap at 64 threads, but jstack had > 2k when I took a thread dump.
[00:04:59] stephend: nirvdrum: any other tweaks you suggest?
[00:05:10] nirvdrum: Unfortunately, no :-=
[00:05:12] nirvdrum: :-/
[00:05:16] stephend: not sure if we're allocating to the hub or what
[00:05:19] santiycr: nirvdrum: that's very interesting, we proxy all our browsers' traffic through the proxy in selenium
[00:05:25] stephend: that's abstracted away by dave's plugin
[00:05:36] santiycr: and I've been seeing java InterruptedException happening randomly
[00:05:41] nirvdrum: santiycr: You use short-lived VMs though, right?
[00:06:18] nirvdrum: I keep EC2 instances up for a long time, so I would OOM within a couple hours.
[00:06:23] santiycr: nirvdrum: yes, mostly
[00:06:30] santiycr: none live more then 30 minutes
[00:06:38] nirvdrum: But I proxy everything and and have lots of short-lived sessions.
[00:07:01] santiycr: interesting 
[00:07:15] nirvdrum: stephend: Anyway, I'm going to see if I can port the SSL handler to Jetty 7.  For an unrelated issue, I'm getting familiar with the Jetty 7 API right now.
[00:07:16] santiycr: I'm actually working to move the proxying out of the selenium jetty and into a separate process
[00:07:42] santiycr: I was thinking on browsermob proxy, as it does the https rewrite already, but I'm worried it's just a rewrite of the same code
[00:07:55] nirvdrum: santiycr: BMP uses the old Jetty 5 proxy code.  I haven't stress-tested to see if it's less vulnerable because you "destroy" proxies.
[00:08:16] nirvdrum: BMP is basically a wrapper around the exact Se proxy code.
[00:08:34] santiycr: damn, I guess I won't go with BMP then
[00:08:38] nirvdrum: It's a servlet with a ReST API that spins out new proxies.
[00:08:54] santiycr: yeah, my problems appear with a single proxy
[00:08:54] nirvdrum: The API servlet runs in a newer Jetty.
[00:09:14] santiycr: I see
[00:09:18] nirvdrum: Since with BMP you create/destroy proxies, it might not be an issue.
[00:09:21] stephend: I have a meeting, but back in 30 or so
[00:09:35] nirvdrum: I.e., you can have one logical proxy server, but create multiple proxies for your various sessions.
[00:09:51] nirvdrum: And yeah, that's confusing as hell because the term "proxy" is used in a lot of different contexts.
[00:10:02] santiycr: well, we would only use one proxy, as after one test, the whole box gets destroyed
[00:10:20] nirvdrum: I'm playing with one proxy per browser per session.
[00:10:22] santiycr: though, we still see InterruptedExceptions inside Selenium's log after running even a single 5 minute session
[00:10:26] nirvdrum: But it's a single BMP install.
[00:10:37] nirvdrum: I just make N different create & destroy requests.
[00:10:45] santiycr: I see
[00:11:25] nirvdrum: I don't know if that limits the leaks or not.  I'm still migrating mogotest off RC and onto RWD.
[00:11:47] santiycr: I'll be doing some more investigation next week
[00:12:00] santiycr: nirvdrum: I'll keep you updated with my results
[00:12:10] nirvdrum: Great.  Likewise.
[00:12:19] santiycr: nirvdrum: oh, I was asked to ping you regarding a possible sauce east coast trip
[00:12:36] santiycr: for a possible boston meetup talk
[00:12:39] nirvdrum: Cool.  We'd love to have you come speak.
[00:12:58] nirvdrum: Have any dates in mind?
[00:13:01] santiycr: how much planning needs to go regarding booking a date?
[00:13:14] santiycr: we were thinking late july
[00:13:38] santiycr: actually, second week in july
[00:13:54] santiycr: if that would work for you, we'll move forward asking approval here and I'll come up with a takl
[00:13:56] nirvdrum: I'd like a couple months to try to secure the venue.
[00:14:13] santiycr: what would work for you?
[00:14:36] nirvdrum: I'm pretty available.  We were doing Tuesdays I think.  Although we really haven't had a meeting a while.
[00:14:45] nirvdrum: llaskin has been bugging me to get another set up.
[00:15:13] santiycr: cool!
[00:15:57] nirvdrum: Wed. or Thurs. would probably work as well.
[00:16:07] santiycr: I have a couple of topics I've been talking/wanting to talk about, if you guys have some time, I'd love to chat about what fits best to the boston group 
[00:16:32] nirvdrum: Talk about them all!
[00:16:49] santiycr: ok, so if I confirm within 1 week, would mid July work? (second week or third)
[00:17:03] nirvdrum: Yeah.  That'll be fine.
[00:17:08] santiycr: cool
[00:17:20] nirvdrum: FYI, middle of July sucks to be in Boston.  It's incredibly hot and humid.
[00:17:49] santiycr: oh well
[00:17:51] santiycr: :)
[00:18:08] santiycr: we'll have to do another visit in september or october  
[00:18:38] nirvdrum: Heh.
[00:18:50] santiycr: ok, will have Ashley move forward with a trip! Fingers crossed.
[00:18:59] nirvdrum: I'm on IRC every day and you have my email/twitter when you can confirm.
[00:19:46] santiycr: will do, for sure
[00:20:16] nirvdrum: Great.

[06:55:34] Careem: what are native events and how does WebDriver locate elemts, ( I know that we need to use id, xpath, css) but how is it different from browserbot.js in selenium RC
[IRC logfile - Started Wed May 23 07:00:24 2012]
[07:00:24] kamoricks: Mostly cause it uses the browser's existing automation instead of injected user js.
[07:01:26] Careem: kamoricks: any idea of how its accomplished
[07:02:08] Careem: kamoricks: Im doing a comparison between RC and WebDriver, I need a few facts
[07:04:02] kamoricks: Careem: I know it loads up Firefox and, for xpath, calls document.evaluate(), and seems to stream across a lot of JS events. For native events, it actually synthesizes key events on Windows sent straight to the open window, which improves javascript event handling (as in, they actually fire the same as a user). Have you seen http://seleniumhq.org/docs/appendix_migrating_from_rc_to_webdriver.html ?

[09:09:07] selbot2: simonstewart: note from jimevans about 14 hours ago: IE looks pretty good from my testing, but I've not done a thorough job, having only tested IE 9. 
[09:09:09] Depado: Hi everyone, is there a way to run only one instance of firefox for multiple JUnit tests with Selenium RC ?
[09:09:39] simonstewart: Depado: just keep a reference to the webdriver instance that's kept between tests
[09:10:06] Depado: simonstewart: Selenium RC. I can't use scLocators with webdriver unless someone tell me how to... :/
[09:10:24] simonstewart: Same applies for selenium rc too
[09:10:54] simonstewart: You might find this handy: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/appendix_migrating_from_rc_to_webdriver.html
[09:11:12] Depado: simonstewart: Well I already tried that. Declaring the SeleniumDefault in static and reuse it... Still doesn't work 
[09:11:35] simonstewart: And don't call "stop" at the end of your test, or "start" at the end
[09:12:51] Depado: simonstewart: I use start in my @BeforeClass which is executed only once in my class and stop in my @AfterClass which is executed once in my class too. 
[09:13:06] simonstewart: Then you should be good to go
[09:13:14] barancev: ave, simonstewart!
[09:13:19] Depado: simonstewart: By the way that tutorial seems great but webdriver isn't compatible with user-extensions.js ...
[09:13:43] simonstewart: barancev: hi
[09:13:55] simonstewart: Depado: no it's not. 
[09:14:08] simonstewart: But most of what people do with a user extension can be done in code too
[09:14:35] barancev: simonstewart: can we just enable compound css selectors by removing the quard, or should we add some tests too?
[09:14:51] barancev: guard, even
[09:14:52] simonstewart: We should add some tests too
[09:14:56] Depado: I need to use the user-extensions.js provided by smartclient. It's a huge file.
[09:15:01] simonstewart: Always add the tests :)
[09:15:09] simonstewart: What's smartclient?
[09:15:26] Depado: Smartclient are the developpers of smartGWT.
[09:16:05] simonstewart: Is the userextension.js available anywhere?
[09:16:13] simonstewart: And do you use every feature in it?
[09:16:48] Depado: I got the user-extensions.js, just download the eval version of smartgwt, it's in the folder Selenium. 
[09:16:57] Depado: Yeah quite every feature is used...
[09:17:26] Depado: http://justbeamit.com/62fd1
[09:18:10] alp82 has joined #selenium
[09:18:39] simonstewart: interesting stuff. 
[09:19:11] Depado: Yeah GWT and smartGWT are great. Though... It's a pain to unit test.
[09:19:35] simonstewart: We've started talking with the GWT team to try and make it a little less painful
[09:19:57] davehunt has joined #selenium
[09:20:25] Depado: So I guess I'll have to stay on Selenium RC. Well they have their own testing function, though it takes ages to test since the GWT module must be fully loaded before each test.
[09:20:25] simonstewart: Most of this looks pretty easy to deal with
[09:20:51] simonstewart: doType is totally redundant
[09:21:02] simonstewart: the locators look easy enough to replicate in a By subclass
[09:21:14] simonstewart: doClick shouldn't be needed
[09:21:32] simonstewart: Or doDoubleClick
[09:21:47] simonstewart: of doContextMenu
[09:21:51] Depado: Hu... Well I won't lie, I'm a noob in javascript. I'm a trainee so they told me to unit test the application. Haha good joke.
[09:22:04] simonstewart: D'oh!
[09:22:13] zac_sel has joined #selenium
[09:22:22] Depado: Even an expert in Java J2EE didn't manage to do it in 3 weeks.
[09:22:23] simonstewart: So typing and clicking in webdriver are a lot closer to how a user would do these actions
[09:22:56] Depado: Yeah I know I already tried driver. The only thing missing are the scLocators. Without that I can't locate any element on my page.
[09:22:59] Bebe has joined #selenium
[09:23:13] simonstewart: Heh.
[09:23:23] barancev: simonstewart: why Augmeter contains addDriverAugmentation(SUPPORTS_FINDING_BY_CSS, new AddFindsByCss());
[09:23:28] simonstewart: Gimme a couple of minutes
[09:23:40] simonstewart: barancev: because css support wasn't globally available
[09:23:44] Depado: simonstewart: Right (Thanks for the help you're giving me ^^)
[09:23:56] barancev: it is implemented in the RemoteWebDriver class
[09:24:31] simonstewart: Then we can probably remove it now
[09:24:38] simonstewart: That wasn't always the case :)
[09:28:05] amitev has joined #selenium
[09:28:27] barancev: simonstewart: I've found that Actions does not work in iframes -- it gets frame-relative coordinates, and uses them as if they were window-related. do you have an idea how can this be fixed?
[09:28:33] andreastt: Grr.  Hint: Don't implement your popup windows as browser windows with HTML+CSS.  You'll regret it.
[09:28:54] simonstewart: barancev: off the top of head? Not really
[09:30:18] barancev: simonstewart: do we have something like "getLocationRelativeToWindow" in atoms?
[09:30:27] simonstewart: I don't think so
[09:30:37] barancev: ok
[09:38:23] simonstewart: :gist

[09:39:21] simonstewart: That should get you started
[09:40:17] Depado: So you think with webdriver and that function i should get it work ? Sounds amazing ^^
[09:40:31] Depado: I'll give it a try. 
[09:40:47] Depado: Thanks a lot for your help anyway that's nice ^^
[09:41:38] simonstewart: That's one of the functions you need for finding elements. The others should be similar

[11:45:23] simonstewart: If we're throwing an exception, a WebDriverException is the one to go for
[11:45:54] barancev: simonstewart: generic WebDriverException?

[11:57:04] barancev: simonstewart: it's not empty, it's none :)
[11:57:12] simonstewart: Same difference :)

[11:57:40] Dude-X_: give me a moment
[11:57:47] barancev: though...
[11:58:25] barancev: simonstewart: regular "empty page" is <html><body></body></html>, it's not an empty string
[11:58:51] simonstewart: Depends on the browser
[11:58:59] barancev: may be
[11:59:07] simonstewart: the docs for that method already say that we return an "artist's impression"

[15:02:33] nitin_ has joined #selenium
[15:04:48] andreastt: zac_sel_: It should scroll horizontally also to reach a given element.
[15:05:06] zac_sel_: thanks andreastt 
[15:05:14] zac_sel_: I meant to ask you something last week but i think you were away
[15:05:17] andreastt: Whether a given implementation supports it is of course an entirely different question. (-;
[15:05:24] zac_sel_: :)
[15:05:39] jarib: llaskin: hmm, not sure. does it work if you do it manually (without the gem)? 
[15:05:47] andreastt: Possible, we had constitution day last week 8_:

[15:05:59] llaskin: jarib yes
[15:06:00] llaskin: some of them work
[15:06:01] zac_sel_: in opera/linux I noticed the window name overridden by webdriver
[15:06:03] llaskin: i'd say its 50 50
[15:06:20] andreastt: zac_sel_: Window name?
[15:06:30] zac_sel_: yeah javascript window.name
[15:06:50] andreastt: I think we set that if it doesn't already have a specified name.
[15:07:02] zac_sel_: ah yes, in this case it didn't.
[15:07:20] zac_sel_: I made a solution with window handle instead which should be more stable anyway
[15:07:47] andreastt: Is it a bug in OperaDriver?
[15:08:43] zac_sel_: depends if you consider our test using switch_to_window('') a valid call or not!
[15:08:56] andreastt: I'm not sure what the spec says, to be honest…
[15:09:41] zac_sel_: it's a behaviour that differs to other browsers anyway. whehter right/wrong 
[15:10:17] andreastt: What do the others do?
[15:10:39] zac_sel_: well firefox just leaves window name as a zls

[15:11:42] zac_sel_: (yes)
[15:12:03] zac_sel_: anyway it's more stalbe to use window handle anyway imo so this is not blocking

[15:15:31] zac_sel_: ok I'll do so andreastt 
[15:16:20] andreastt: zac_sel_: What is meant to happen if you switch to window by "" (zls) and there are multiple windows with no name?
[15:16:27] andreastt: Should it pick the first one?
[15:17:02] zac_sel_: I have no idea andreastt 
[15:17:32] andreastt: Good thing we have a spec! d-:
[15:17:52] zac_sel_: :)
[15:18:16] zac_sel_: I'm guessing if you do tha and htere are multiple windows then you have a bit of a problem on your hands, not webdriver

[17:00:22] lukeis: nirvdrum: do you know how selenium-grid.seleniumhq is built / deployed?  I'd love to re-organize svn by moving the selenium-grid folder under the websites folder... but obviously anything autobuilding it would need to be updated ;)
[17:00:28] mdgreenfield has left #selenium
[17:00:36] krosenvold: nirvdrum: You mean they time out immedately once they dequeue ?
[17:01:13] nirvdrum: lukeis: I think it gets deployed from the XServe.  I just know I push and the site updates.
[17:01:20] krosenvold: nirvdrum: Is there some kind of second/millisecond confusion ?
[17:01:51] nirvdrum: krosenvold: It's pretty sporadic.  It could be right after a new session, could be after executing another command.
[17:02:23] nirvdrum: krosenvold: Possibly.  I'm afraid the more likely scenario may just be that while under load, the system clock isn't reliable on these nodes.
[17:02:36] simonstewart: patrick knows how the docs build process works
[17:03:00] jimevans: bah! bot.dom.hasAttribute is just plain broken
[17:03:09] krosenvold: nirvdrum: Although the system clock on vmware isn't that accurate, I haven't seen it acting *that* wildly
[17:03:42] nirvdrum: krosenvold: I've been meaning to update the JVM on these for a while now.  So I'm going to try that first.  The timeout code itself seems pretty straightforward.

[17:04:49] simonstewart: jimevans: ?
[17:05:24] nirvdrum: lukeis: My hunch is adamgoucher or paulgrandje know how it works as well.

[17:05:29] AutomatedTester: lukeis: santi might know

[17:08:55] nirvdrum: I thought it was a Bamboo thing.  Maybe it's just a post commit hook someplace. 
[17:09:13] krosenvold: nirvdrum: Yes, I think the timeout code has gotten simpler. Of course, I started wondering if there's any timeout that applies while inside the queue ;)

[17:10:35] lukeis: davehunt: i haven't seen it in bamboo... it's gotta be somewhere else maybe... ;)
[17:10:43] nirvdrum: krosenvold: I also spent quite a while trying to force a closed stream.  I was only able to do it somewhat randomly and after > 5 min. of disconnect.
[17:11:14] krosenvold: nirvdrum: I was thinking about that; maybe there's some underlying socket option that needs to be tweaked....
[17:11:33] davehunt: no, it doesn't appear to be in Bamboo
[17:11:54] nirvdrum: krosenvold: Ultimately, my solution for now is I added a new servlet with an API that I can query for available grid capacity and I make it the responsibility of the clients to check for available capacity before enqueuing.  The request queue handles any race conditions.
[17:12:03] davehunt: the seleniumhq and docs are in Bamboo
[17:12:17] davehunt: see http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/websites/www.seleniumhq.org/pom.xml
[17:12:38] davehunt: the grid site has a pom too http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/selenium-grid-website/pom.xml
[17:12:59] lukeis: yep
[17:13:00] nirvdrum: krosenvold: I played with other connectors.  It's possible that Jetty 8 might handle half-closed connections better.  But that was a road I wasn't about to travel down.
[17:13:07] lukeis: but who kicks off the maven command ;)
[17:13:15] lukeis: who/where
[17:13:18] davehunt: lukeis: not me, I suspect nobody has for a loong time
[17:13:26] davehunt: maybe phillipe?
[17:13:37] nirvdrum: davehunt: I'm pretty sure it's a post commit thing.
[17:13:45] lukeis: nirvdrum made it seem like recent changes are getting reflected in the site currently though
[17:13:59] davehunt: oh, well that's cool. no idea how that's working then
[17:14:21] lukeis: yay... i'll email patrick and see if he can shed some light on it

[19:08:50] santiycr: llaskin: deal!
[19:09:04] jimevans: changing webdriver.atoms.element.getAttribute() to use bot.dom.getAttribute() seems to work for *most* cases.
[19:10:20] jimevans: there is a corner case for pre-IE9, where if you specify <boolean attribute>="false", our code returns null for the attribute.
[19:10:34] jimevans: which i don't know if that's right or wrong anymore.
[19:10:51] jleyba: wrong
[19:11:10] jleyba: well...shit...I hate boolean attributes
[19:11:23] jimevans: you and me both, brother.
[19:11:32] jleyba: Ok, *normally* if you specify a boolean attribute, its mere presence implies true, which is why we do the true | null thing
[19:11:51] jimevans: right. as specified in the HTML5 spec.
[19:11:52] jleyba: Does IE let you say readonly=false, and it treats it as false?
[19:13:51] jimevans: no, it treats it as true. which is correct.
[19:13:59] sumxyz has joined #selenium
[19:14:16] jimevans: but our code sees a value of 'false' from the attribute node, and interprets that as "the node doesn't exist"
[19:15:18] jleyba: Oh, that bug
[19:15:36] jleyba: Once upon a time I had an if-statement for that

[20:11:35] forrestslater: oh ok
[20:11:37] santiycr: oh
[20:12:29] santiycr: well, one of the things I'm working on is a proxy to replace selenium's in our test servers
[20:12:38] barancev: in the local env I use BMP and set autoBasicAuthorization -- it's browser independedn and works for all
[20:12:41] santiycr: an alternative is to use Sauce Connect
[20:12:58] forrestslater: yes, someone just mentioned that to me
[20:13:01] santiycr: and have connect proxy through your own proxy, forrestslater
[20:13:20] santiycr: so, that way users can control the proxy completely
