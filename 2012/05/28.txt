[16:31:10] simonstewart: I think I may be about to fix the failing IE build
[16:31:29] jimevans: simonstewart: what's the change?
[16:31:46] jimevans: it looks to me like we're not pushing the latest IE server to the sauce machines...
[16:31:58] simonstewart: There's that
[16:32:14] dawagner: We're telling them to use it, it's possible they're not choosing to...
[16:32:14] llaskin has joined #selenium
[16:32:22] simonstewart: There's also the fact that we want to be looking for "readOnly" in the test, but we actually look for "readonly". The atoms aren't handling that quite right
[16:32:26] jimevans: ah. that might be the issue.
[16:33:02] jimevans: simonstewart: i went 'round and 'round about that last week.
[16:33:17] simonstewart: There's something very fishy going on though
[16:33:20] jimevans: but the atoms are supposed to handle things case-insensitively.
[16:33:26] simonstewart: Because the test passes if you open the F12 debugging tools
[16:33:26] jimevans: there's even a test for that.
[16:33:58] dawagner: We're setting the iedriver-version capability to the URL of a zip file containing...
[16:34:01] dawagner: Aha
[16:34:20] jimevans: aha?
[16:34:24] dawagner: Containing the exe under a few folders
[16:34:33] dawagner: The folders are probably breaking things

[16:37:42] llaskin: yes but last week it was 8 successful:-P
[16:38:05] jimevans: simonstewart: at least 4 of those are IE, and of those 4, 3 should be solved by the readonly attribute.

[16:38:30] jimevans: and i *think* if we pushed the latest IE server to the sauce VMs, those would go away.
[16:39:03] dawagner: jimevans: I've just made the change, next commit should drop the paths in the zip
[16:39:09] barancev: 2 failures are chrome -- it's color
[16:39:38] dawagner: Which I believe you introduced, barancev ;)
[16:39:38] jimevans: dawagner: awesome. where are you pulling the exe from? prebuilts?
[16:39:53] dawagner: Yep
[16:39:54] barancev: I think we should ignore these tests for Chrome and wait till atoms will be updated in chroomesriver
[16:39:57] jimevans: sweet!
[16:40:02] barancev: chromedriver
[16:40:28] dawagner: barancev: Seems sensible
[16:40:31] barancev: dawagner: me? colors? no, sir, it was you :)
[16:40:36] dawagner: You changed the test ;)
[16:40:50] barancev: ah, yes, otherwise firefox failed
[16:41:04] dawagner: heh, guess we worked together on it!
[16:41:22] barancev: yes, I forgot to disable chrome
[16:41:52] barancev: btw, chrome is almost good -- it just adds spaces
[16:41:52] jimevans: now if i could figure out why the two failures in the IE6 atoms tests were failing, and the extraneous IE6 java tests, i could rest.
[16:42:12] barancev: Expected: ("transparent" or "rgba(0,0,0,0)")  got: "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"
[16:42:44] barancev: and may be we should remote "transparent" from expected
[16:44:23] jimevans: wow. i haven't built on this machine in *ages*
[16:44:50] barancev: the only bad thing is firefox 11 xp -- it's failed with "Selenium can't find the server at a.25.sci.illicitonion.com"
[16:44:51] dawagner: If we've standardised our implementation, absolutely
[16:45:59] dawagner: Ugh.  Ok, I'm going to try to get Sauce to make it *much* easier to debug that kind of failure
[16:46:46] dawagner: In the mean time, I am going to set up a load test to find other causes of it :)

[16:48:47] barancev: Samit is triaging IDE bugs, nice!
[16:58:57] barancev: why assertColorFuzzyEquals in atom tests checks only "rgb" part of the color, and ignore "a"?
[16:59:29] barancev: it's checked separately
[16:59:55] barancev: is it most "non-standard" part that differs from browser to browser?

[17:19:39] andreastt_: I think I have a fix in OperaDriver's HEAD to reduce those 7 failing tests.
[17:19:50] andreastt_: Will do another release tomorrow if I get the time.
[17:20:31] andreastt_: (There's an issue with profiles and statefulness in the current version that's in Selenium.)
[17:21:47] dawagner: Thanks andreastt_ :)
[17:22:01] *dawagner is still getting used to having real results coming from CI again :p
[17:22:32] andreastt_: Still not sure why we're seeing severe instability of the JavaScript tests though.
[17:22:38] andreastt_: Or has that been fixed now?
[17:23:49] jimevans: right. have fun everybody. i'm off to do some grocery shopping and enjoy the rest of the day.
[17:23:51] andreastt_: Of course, that too might be related to the statefulness issue…
[17:24:00] dawagner: That's the same bug I filed a while ago, I believe :)
[17:24:07] jimevans has left #selenium
[17:24:17] andreastt_: dawagner: Large JS tests?
[17:25:01] andreastt_: I wish the Desktop people would get it together and release something soon.
[17:25:09] dawagner: JS being slow by document.write-ing script tags
[17:25:16] andreastt_: The latest Desktop mainline uses the ecmascript-service, which should be faster.
[17:25:34] andreastt_: Okay.  I'll investigate that with the internal builds.
[17:25:36] simonstewart: We have some users who do things that take an exceptionally long time in JS
[17:25:42] simonstewart: (in the order of minutes)
[17:25:44] dawagner: I don't suppose there's a sneaky prerelease I can test, is there?
[17:26:03] andreastt_: Not sure, it might be in the Opera Next beta release.
[17:26:15] andreastt_: But I'm on a train internet connection, so I don't want to download it from here.
[17:26:42] andreastt_: It shuld say “Using ecmascript-service” in the logging (FINE) if it is.
[17:26:54] andreastt_: should too!
[17:27:03] dawagner: Ok, I'll give it a go if I have a moment :)
[17:27:18] andreastt_: Today is day off in Norway, so I'll be back at work tomorrow.
[17:27:38] dawagner: aha! /me wonders why Norway and the USA share a day off
[17:28:15] andreastt_: simonstewart: http://sci.illicitonion.com:8080/job/Opera%2011.62%20Linux%20Javascript%20Tests/
[17:28:18] andreastt_: simonstewart: It _used_ to be stable, though.
[17:28:36] andreastt_: Even though we were failing lots of tests before.
[17:29:11] dawagner: I imagine it will be related to network latency, which will vary
[17:29:59] andreastt_: dawagner: Whit Monday, according to Wikipedia.

[17:39:41] zac_sel: hdmi, dvi, etc
[17:39:50] dawagner: Cool :)
[17:39:56] zac_sel: only thing we can't get into it at the moment is the Wii :(
[17:40:15] dawagner: simonstewart: FIXED! ^^
[17:40:58] simonstewart: Yay
