[01:28:55] kallisti: I suspect there's a bug in the Python profile code.
[01:29:01] kallisti: it looks for a user.js
[01:29:05] kallisti: but it should be looking for prefs.js
[01:29:33] kallisti: also it doesn't handle escape sequences in its parsing regex
[01:29:39] kallisti: which are something that can actually occur
[01:29:48] kallisti: and shouldn't be overlooked
[01:30:30] odix: i feel like there is a bug in the python coding too
[01:31:13] kallisti: if I recall there are some limitations with frame switching
[01:31:19] kallisti: that apply to all of webdriver.
[01:31:23] kallisti: but I don't recall what.
[01:31:28] kallisti: I'm talking about the Firefox profile code.
[01:33:19] kallisti: hm..
[01:33:23] kallisti: but Ruby does it as well
[01:33:38] kallisti: I have no user.js in my own profile. so why is it in this one?
[01:39:40] kallisti: oh I see
[01:39:57] kallisti: user.js is a second file for permanent changes, and prefs.js is auto-generated including changes from user.js

[02:49:15] kallisti: I saw that the Ruby code encodes profiles as {"zip": "..."}
[02:49:17] kallisti: so I did that
[02:49:31] kallisti: and now loading my own profile doesn't open up a Firefox window.
[02:49:38] kallisti: the server confirms that the session command terminated
[02:49:40] kallisti: but no window appears
[02:49:50] kallisti: so I'm guessing extensions are breaking.
[02:49:57] kallisti: because I don't copy the entire profile directory.

[10:42:19] andreastt: Why should one be allowed to call new Actions(driver).click().perform()?  The context depends on what actions you've done before, surely?
[10:43:34] andreastt: Should the last known mouse position be disregarded if calling click() through an Actions chain?

[11:01:58] barancev: andreastt: click without parameters should not change the current mouse coordinates
[11:02:34] barancev: new Actions(driver).moveToElement(element, 10, 10).click().perform()
[11:03:03] andreastt: Hm, that makes no sense to me.
[11:03:17] andreastt: We need to have talk about it.
[11:03:23] AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
[11:03:29] barancev: it should click to the point that has offset (10,10) from the top left corner of the element
[11:04:15] barancev: otherwise, how can you perform this click? (not in the center, but into a specific point of an element)
[11:05:10] barancev: the same for other methods that have no element parameter, fro example -- release()
[11:05:24] andreastt: I think we're talking about different things.
[11:05:54] barancev: new Actions(driver).clickAndHold(element).moveByOffset(100, 100).release().perform()
[11:06:32] barancev: may be I've not got the context of your question? :)
[11:07:05] andreastt: When we perform an actions chain, we store the mouse's last known position internally in the driver so that a future click() action (like new Actions(driver).click().perform()) would click the same coordinates.
[11:07:18] barancev: yes
[11:07:36] andreastt: That test sort of implies that line should throw.
[11:08:27] andreastt: â€¦ because no coordinates were given.
[11:09:57] barancev: it's expected to throw on moveToElement(null)
[11:10:43] barancev: there is no calls to 'click' in the test testCannotMoveToANullLocator
[11:10:52] barancev: that's a different issue
[11:11:20] barancev: aha, you mean the second assert, sorry
[11:11:54] barancev: I see, yes, I don't know how should it work :)
[11:13:04] andreastt: (=
[11:13:04] barancev: no wonder it is @Ignore :)
[11:13:24] andreastt: Yes, thought I'd make two tests to make it clearer.
[11:13:28] andreastt: It was testing two things previously.

[12:36:36] AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
[12:37:28] Dude-X_: andreastt, the default setting is to block until the page loads
[12:37:39] Dude-X_: which means no timeout

[12:38:49] Dude-X_: andreastt, you can set the fast load strategy to unstable to have it stop waiting for the page to load after a while, but it makes the overall tests flaky

[14:50:42] h8R_at_work: RossPatterson: yes, when I execute it, it opens firefox
[14:51:15] RossPatterson: You can't feed Selenium a shell-script as the Firefox "executable".  You need to give it the actual filepath of the compiled Firefox program.
[14:52:00] h8R_at_work: RossPatterson: so if i change     $session = $web_driver->session('firefox'); with the actual filepath of the firefox will be okay ?
[14:53:26] RossPatterson: Dunno - I don't do PHP.  But somehow you need to specify the real path of the Firefox binary, not the shell script.
[14:53:54] RossPatterson: In C#, I think it would be specified as a DesiredCapability element when creating the session.

[19:46:56] RossPatterson: methods: I'm not sure that will work.  I don't think RC uses the Recorder - I'm pretty sure that's IDE-only.
[19:47:52] RossPatterson: But I have a thing we use to capture JavaScript errors on pages, and it works by hooking window.onerror, and it does it during window creation.
[19:48:11] RossPatterson: It's pretty invasive to RC, and it wouldn't work with WebDriver at all.
[19:49:20] RossPatterson: But if you're comfortable supporting a couple of hundred lines of moderately-complicated JavaScript, it works quite well.
[19:50:19] RossPatterson: It's based on the existing RC model for hooking window.alert.

[20:32:32] Dude-X: lukeis: i wrote a similar function today in java, but not as a one liner
[20:33:46] RossPatterson: methods: I've got a couple of unit tests in C#.  They boil down to a RunScript() call. I'll add them to the gist/

[20:35:52] lukeis: i use java for my actual testing... but i'm writing an automation script for people to run, so python! ;)
[20:36:28] RossPatterson: methods: It's like getAlert, getConfirmation, etc.  You call getJavaScriptError() to get the error text.  If one occurs and you don't ask for it's text, the next command fails.
[20:36:49] Dude-X: actually the devs are using python bindings for webdriver loadtesting
[20:37:05] Dude-X: i did the work of porting our wrappers :D
[20:37:50] methods: RossPatterson:  i wonder how to prove that this is even working .. 
[20:39:37] RossPatterson: I had to write a test that caused an error.  For example: selenium.RunScript("window.ThereBetterNotBeAFunctionByThisName();"); should record an error "window.ThereBetterNotBeAFunctionByThisName is not a function at http://localhost/ line 0", and the next Selenium command you send should fail with an exception saying that.
[20:40:04] methods: sure that happens 
[20:40:21] methods: but it says ERROR: .. i figured i should see  what your printing out                   LOG.info('window.onerror() recorded: ' + error);
[20:41:46] RossPatterson: You may not see that.  It depends on how you're starting the RC server.   We run it with -debug and -browserlog, so we get all the info in the server log files.
[20:42:07] methods: but i even tried throwing a window.alert in there and got nothing 
[20:42:56] methods: Permission denied for <moz-safe-about:blank> to get property Window.onerror
[20:44:06] methods:  surprised this isn't a standard thing 
[20:44:37] RossPatterson: Hmm ... "Works On My Machine" ... and every other machine we use :-)
[20:44:53] RossPatterson: Wait - RC isn't catching alerts either?
[20:45:05] RossPatterson: That's a core RC function.  This code doesn't change that.
[20:45:07] methods: well maybe i didn't save the file correctly 
[20:45:08] methods: sorry 
[20:45:13] methods: but I'm definitively getting that error now 
[20:45:27] methods: it makes sense that some external window shouldn't be allowed to set the onerror for another window right ?
[20:46:55] RossPatterson: If the windows are loaded from the same site, they ought to be able to.  Selenium does this all the time
[20:48:49] methods: yea idk 
[20:49:04] methods: so basically rc has a different js implementation of browserbot and your hooking into that right ?
[20:49:24] methods: I'm using selenium 2.15.0 
[20:50:47] RossPatterson: Yes.  RC's selenium-browserbot.js has it's own hooks that take over window.create() so they can take over window.alert(), window.prompt(), and window.confirm() in pop-up windows.  This code wraps that hook to also take over window.onerror().
[20:51:15] RossPatterson: RC is almost entirely unchanged since 1.0.3.  Just some minor browser-version changes in the Firefox plugin
[20:52:13] RossPatterson: The code I studied to set this up is Selenium.prototype.ensureNoUnhandledPopups in selenium-api.js, and the browserbot parts it calls.
[20:54:40] RossPatterson: Gotta go - much to do tonight.  I'll see if I can spend some time this weekend packaging this code in a form for someone else to use :-)

[21:52:11] andreastt_: santiycr: Which Opera version do you have on Sauce now?
[21:52:20] AutomatedTester: andreastt_: afaik its only in Firefox
[21:52:38] AutomatedTester: omg... the selenium server is slow to launch
[21:53:03] santiycr: andreastt: 11.61
[21:53:07] mdgreenfield1 has left #selenium
[21:53:36] andreastt_: santiycr: Is it available on Windows also?
[21:53:41] andreastt_: AutomatedTester: Aha.
[21:53:47] barancev: IE can resize too
[21:54:02] andreastt_: AutomatedTester: Is that a pure JS implementation?  window.resizeTo() or something?
[21:54:47] AutomatedTester: andreastt_: no, Firefox blocks that now
[21:54:57] andreastt_: Interesting.
[21:54:58] AutomatedTester: so its done via calls to the Chrome
[21:55:29] barancev: santiycr: hi! I bet out CI server does not run IE tests using IEDriverServer
[21:55:46] lukeis: i thought we just had that JS in the plugin (which wasn't blocked)... or is the xpi the same thing as calling it the Chrome?
[21:55:46] barancev: no signs of the server starting in the console log
[21:55:47] AutomatedTester: yay bug fixed off to bed

[21:57:53] AutomatedTester: lukeis: ah ha?

[21:57:58] andreastt_: santiycr: Error?
[21:58:05] andreastt_: santiycr: Anything I can help with?
[21:58:07] santiycr: let me get you the error message
[21:58:11] santiycr: tots!
[21:58:18] santiycr: barancev: Sauce is ready for it!
[21:59:02] andreastt_: santiycr: Recently enabled Selenium CI testing for Opera.  It's working quite well so far.
[21:59:26] barancev: santiycr: let's see: http://sci.illicitonion.com:8080/job/IE%209%20Java%20Tests/1099/consoleFull

[22:00:33] barancev: there should be a line like "Started InternetExplorerDriver server (32-bit)" -- there is no one

[22:01:05] santiycr: andreastt: what do you mean? using sauce?
[22:01:25] santiycr: barancev: the remote driver tests should be the ones running in Sauce
[22:01:39] santiycr: and I don't think you'll see that log in the client side if that's the case

[22:03:12] santiycr: andreastt: won't be able to focus on opera's issue today, sorry
[22:03:13] andreastt_: santiycr: Yes
[22:03:21] santiycr: andreastt: on linux?
[22:03:30] andreastt_: santiycr: Okay, just let me know if there's anything you need from our side.
[22:03:36] andreastt_: santiycr: Yep.
[22:03:52] barancev: :gist
[22:03:53] selbot2_: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[22:03:55] santiycr: andreastt: cool, I'll re-enable opera on windows and get back to you with the failure message
[22:04:04] andreastt_: Great! (-:
[22:04:24] santiycr: andreastt: all our images have it installed, I'm sure it's just a matter of figuring out the config and env variables
[22:04:49] andreastt_: santiycr: Speaking of which, what kind of VM solution are you using?
[22:04:55] barancev: santiycr: when I run 'go test_ie' on my local machine I have my log starting with something like this: https://gist.github.com/2597720
[22:05:07] andreastt_: I'm tasked with setting up a cloud-like solution for a new system at work.
[22:05:14] barancev: lines 8-10 shows that ie server started
[22:05:30] santiycr: andreastt_: kvm-quemu
[22:05:52] andreastt_: santiycr: I don't know that very well, does it support stopping/resuming from a VM image?
[22:06:09] barancev: why don't we have the same on CI server?
[22:06:10] santiycr: yeah
[22:06:15] santiycr: you give it a hard drive image
[22:06:24] andreastt_: Ah, right.
[22:07:19] santiycr: barancev: not completely sure
[22:07:26] santiycr: dawagner is the one to ask that :)
[22:07:38] barancev: ok

[22:08:42] santiycr: ;)
[22:09:15] santiycr: so, good news, you guys are running tests using the new IEDriverServer
[22:09:19] santiycr: in the cloud!
[22:09:38] barancev: yes, I see, it does work, nice!
