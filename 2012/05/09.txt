[00:39:11] snuff-work: anyone answer me as to why selenium will keep profile copies around after each run until i terminate the selenium server?
[00:44:08] stackedsax: it's using those separate profiles so that two separate firefoxes don't conflict with one another
[00:45:26] stackedsax: but I thought it should get rid of them whenever it gets rid of that session

[17:15:50] Dude-X: for java
[17:17:26] ksummerlin: pash1k: driver.findElements() will return an empty list if it cannot find the element using the specified locator.
[17:18:17] Dude-X: oh i see what he meant

[17:19:29] Dude-X: drive.findElements(By.xpath("path")).size() > 0
[17:19:56] Dude-X: you might want to wrap it in a webdriver wait of 3 seconds to  avoid false negatives
[17:20:44] pash1k: that's what I was missing, the s at the end of element
[17:20:46] barancev: btw, findElements might be much slower than findElement in IE, so you'd choose to catch an exception

[18:17:48] jleyba: :note jarib Yes, page_source is slow in Safari. The extension does not have access to a page's DOM, so it must retrieve it from the injected script. The injected script will then return the DOM to the extension, which passes it along to the WebSocket. I suspect the bottle neck is in sending the DOM from the injected script to the extension.  Unfortunately, I don't think there's anything we can do about it.

[18:31:15] jimevans: alright. why the fuck won't this synthetic mouse work with this jquery element?!?
[18:36:11] pash1k: I have a question: Sometimes my tests fail and the reason is "Other element would receive the click: …" but this only happens once every five or six times. Is there a reason for this?

[18:43:16] ksummerlin_: pash1k: Is your web app using some sort of overlapped div technique between page interactions? This can be common with heavy use of Ajax, or frameworks using ExtJs.
[18:44:00] pash1k: I'm not sure, I'm not the one writing the web app
[18:44:09] pash1k: is there an easy way to fix this, though, if that's the case?
[18:45:53] ksummerlin_: pash1k: Can you paste the full error message to gist.github.com? It should say what element will receive the click.

[18:48:20] sassda has joined #selenium
[18:49:08] ksummerlin_: I'm guessing from the id on the div (div_loading_XXXXX) and the class ptoverlay ptoverlayshow that the web app is using some sort of overlay technique.
[18:49:30] ksummerlin_: And that div is intercepting the click
[18:49:51] farlan has joined #selenium
[18:50:01] pash1k: I guessed as much; I find it odd that that only happens every once in a while
[18:50:16] ksummerlin_: basically you need to look for that div, and then wait for it to either a) disappear, b) become stale in the DOM
[18:50:25] ksummerlin_: or wait a little longer :(
[18:50:41] nhirata has joined #selenium
[18:51:43] ksummerlin_: Our web app uses jQuery BlockUI component which does something similar and I had to spend about two days on/off to get the code correct to wait for the overlay to become hidden.
[18:53:58] pash1k: hmm, okay, thank you
[18:54:13] pash1k: I figured that wasn't an easy answer, but it helps to know that others have had that problem
[18:55:52] ksummerlin_: I basically wrote some additional ExpectedConditions in .NET centered around watching for an element locator=div.blockUI to become visible, and then wait on it to become stale in the DOM.
[18:56:34] ksummerlin_: after it becomes 'stale' then you can click on the elements under the overlay.
[18:57:52] ksummerlin_: I know that some overlays don't remove the div from the DOM but instead slowly change the opacity to 0 and then set the div to hidden.
[18:58:07] ksummerlin_: ala jQuery fadeOut
[18:58:17] pash1k: it seems the div is hidden after the frame is done loading
[18:58:22] pash1k: would something like this work, in that case?
[18:58:23] pash1k: new WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(ExpectedConditions.invisibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("div_loading_UOFU_UU_MYCLASSES_INST_HMPG")));
[18:59:54] ksummerlin_: I think that would work -- I'm not 100% familiar with the Java expected conditions -- but it seems like that would do the trick.

[19:01:26] nhirata has joined #selenium
[19:02:27] ksummerlin_: If you still have problems, you might have to check first that the loading DIV actually becomes visible first and then becomes invisible. Some overlays will try to detect a fast operation and only dispay the overlay after a certain time has expired.
[19:02:59] ksummerlin_: That check should be less than 1 second in most cases.

[19:19:26] RossPatterson: Sounds like your script isn't quitting before it ends.
[19:21:12] REdOG: well, once I close the first browser window the second opens runs the script then closes
