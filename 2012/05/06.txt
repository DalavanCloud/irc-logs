[20:25:12] Dude-X_: interesting
[20:25:24] Dude-X_: are you looking at test_remote
[20:27:42] rstrazhnyk: Hi! I am working for the product company on a QA Auto position, I am using Selenium and Python extensively and get used to this programming language. If some well known outsourcing company wants me for the Java(which I  don't know well) and Selenium job, and my current employer also upped my salary to the same level. What is better to choose - stay on the old job or choose new one with Java?
[20:28:35] rstrazhnyk: does the language really matter in case of developing QA Test automation skills?
[20:30:45] rstrazhnyk: any help appreciated 
[20:31:15] rstrazhnyk: I have to make a choice in some hours
[20:33:17] tessarakt: does someone here know of a good example for Selenium WebDriver code to check the results of a QUnit test?
[20:37:15] rstrazhnyk: tessarakt, maybe you just need to execute some Javascript code?
[20:37:28] tessarakt: ?
[20:37:39] tessarakt: sorry, I don't really understand what you mean
[20:37:44] Dude-X_: rstrazhnyk, stay with Python, Java feels very limited when you're used to Python
[20:38:13] rstrazhnyk: I mean webdriver doesn't have anything for Qunit
[20:38:18] rstrazhnyk: it execute JS code
[20:38:26] rstrazhnyk: it can execute JS Code
[20:38:57] tessarakt: well
[20:39:13] tessarakt: I have a HTML page running the QUnit test
[20:39:33] tessarakt: of course there is no special function for QUnit
[20:39:41] tessarakt: I'm just looking for an example
[20:39:42] rstrazhnyk: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#Q:_How_do_I_execute_Javascript_directly?
[20:39:53] tessarakt: still, that was not my question
[20:39:59] tessarakt: this is one step to far
[20:40:11] tessarakt: I have  a working QUnit test page
[20:40:46] tessarakt: and I have WebDriver code that is running so far (it spaws a browser and closes it)
[20:40:50] rstrazhnyk: https://bitbucket.org/farmas/qunit-webdriver-runner/wiki/Home
[20:41:11] rstrazhnyk: is that you are looking for?
[20:41:44] tessarakt: I don't know
[20:41:49] tessarakt: looks quite complicated
[20:42:23] tessarakt: you just googled yourself, or you know about this stuff?
[20:42:38] rstrazhnyk: I have googled it for you)
[20:42:48] tessarakt: ok
[20:43:06] tessarakt: I'd have been more happy if someone had done it himself
[20:44:08] tessarakt: I already found this: https://bitbucket.org/farmas/qunit-webdriver-runner/wiki/Home
[20:44:24] tessarakt: "Selenium would open these .html pages in the browser and look for the id â€˜testresultsâ€™."
[20:44:46] tessarakt: would be more useful if the author had provided code for what he is doing there
[20:45:01] tessarakt: "I have followed the post of integrating the Qunit tests with CI from here."
[20:45:17] tessarakt: "from here" probably should be a link, but isn't

[20:48:47] tessarakt: when I have all this stuff running, I should write a blogpost about it
