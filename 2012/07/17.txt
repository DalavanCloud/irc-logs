[10:10:28] Manoj: I have done this is Eclipse using Pydev.
[10:10:50] Manoj: So the question is do we need to add any Selenium jar or any stuffs to it.
[10:11:25] Manoj: If its Java, we will add it through Build Path and add those Jar files. But for Python ? what we need to do. It shows in all REd for Selenium based commands 
[10:11:39] Manoj: If any one knows let me know what needs to be done.

[10:15:37] barancev: it should install all you need
[10:16:55] barancev: no, you don't need Java if you want to run your tests on the local host using WebDriver API
[10:17:58] barancev: but you need Java and Selenium Server if you want to run your test on a remote machine, or via RC API (that is remote by its nature)

[12:00:08] DanTester123: ?
[12:01:41] foolx: @Dan: you mean like //*[@id='bgc_signup_container']/div[2]/form/fieldset[3]/input[2]
[12:01:56] foolx: and instead of 'bgc_signup_container' use a string?
[12:02:03] NeptuNooo: foolx: Jetzt kostenlos spielen button - could you translate it into english
[12:02:19] foolx: @NuptuNooo: Play now - free
[12:02:40] foolx: it isn't in german when you open it? Hopefully the elements will be the same!
[12:02:44] tekin has joined #selenium
[12:03:18] DanTester123: For example the variable is ... store|2012-07-15|WeekendDate
[12:03:24] DanTester123: and placed in the Xpath ... //*[@id="2012-06-18|{$WeekendDate}"]
[12:03:35] foolx: @Dan: if yes, you have to create a String before commiting it as search locator. Thats how i did use it
[12:04:30] se-lite: Swadq: browser seem fine..
[12:04:45] se-lite: don't really look like anything bad happend, except for the exception :)
[12:04:49] Swadq: Then I'm not sure, sorry
[12:05:04] foolx: @Dan: i would do it like this: String test = '//*[@id="' + '2012-07-15|' + '{$' + 'WeekendDate' + '}"]'
[12:05:14] NeptuNooo: this is working CSS Selector for the button:  div.bgc_button span.bgc_signup_form_register_replace_text span.regPlay
[12:05:22] NeptuNooo: foolx ;)
[12:05:30] foolx: and the stuff '2012-07-15|' you can change to your variable with char# to use
[12:06:37] foolx: NeptuNooo: IntelliJ is running in background, testing that selector ;) Hopefully it will work. Most of the times, i have the problem, that the pages change their layout
[12:06:52] foolx: 'Step 4b (231): ** Submit-Button #1 clicked' sounds good ... :)

[12:08:46] foolx: @NeptuNooo: strange... the same as my own cssSelectors: he says he clicked the button, but nothing happens. He later (more than 5 seconds later) tries to find several items for validation and fails. Then takes a screenshot = still on registerpage
[12:09:44] NeptuNooo: hmm
[12:10:02] foolx: just have to restart the selenium server ... stupid autoupdate again ... 
[12:10:15] foolx: afterwards i want to make sure, that i already use 2.24
[12:13:31] NeptuNooo: maybe this will work because there are 2 input fields and it seems that one of those is the button you want to click
[12:13:33] NeptuNooo: fieldset.bgc_signup_form_buttons input.bgc_button.bgc_signup_form_back
[12:14:16] NeptuNooo: and
[12:14:17] NeptuNooo: fieldset.bgc_signup_form_buttons input.bgc_button.bgc_signup_form_register
[12:15:03] NeptuNooo: try the 2 buttons i think it should work
[12:15:11] NeptuNooo: try them one by one
[12:15:12] _gates has joined #selenium
[12:15:18] foolx: script is running again ... try the second one first and i will watch if he clicks...
[12:15:46] Manoj has joined #selenium
[12:15:55] NeptuNooo: the thing is that i don't know which of those 2 is the correct one
[12:16:05] foolx: i have a strange idea .... *tests stuff*
[12:16:24] NeptuNooo: but the input fields are type="button" so the chances are that it will work
[12:17:29] foolx: most likely the _back will go back and register will try to register ... but i have just watched what he does (and he doesn't click) ... but i have an idea
[12:19:21] foolx: stupid code... when i enter a birthdate into "Birthdate" there is a popup with the ability to select a day ... i think/hope thats what cancels the click
[12:19:36] foolx: YES! DAMN IT!
[12:20:34] foolx: Thanks NeptuNooo: my own cssSelector ('.regPlay') is working now... it was never a problem of clicking the damn button ... the birthdate selector was simple overlaid over the registerbutton he wanted to click ... DAMN how stupid!
[12:21:47] NeptuNooo: stupid reason is always the reason of 90% of all problems :)
[12:22:07] foolx: wasn't 90% of all errors found in layer 7?
[12:22:21] foolx: oh wait ... It's nearly the same as stupid ;)
[12:23:23] NeptuNooo: im glad you are back on the track
[12:23:25] NeptuNooo: ;)
[12:23:59] foolx: me too! i was ... 3 days into that stupid page now
[12:24:38] foolx: already had to change my db structure to make sure it will work... first page that needed a real birthdate to be entered ... all other pages already had 01.01.1970 as basis
[12:31:28] DanTester123: <foolx> Xpath will be used to locate an element on the screen, however the of the date will change and hence the reason to insert a variable...?
[12:33:59] foolx: @Dan: as i understood, you wanted to select the element with the right date right? and you already got the date inside of a string?
[12:34:22] DanTester123: Getting .... [error] locator not found: //*[@id="' + '2012-07-15|' + '{$' + 'WeekendDate' + '}"]
[12:34:56] foolx: @Dan: of course, you tried to enter the stuff as string without use the stuff as strings
[12:35:21] foolx: you said you have 'store|2012-07-15|WeekendDate' in a stringvariable?
[12:35:54] DanTester123: yes
[12:36:36] Parabola has joined #selenium
[12:36:45] DanTester123: <foolx> Sorry what Im doing wrong.
[12:36:45] foolx: so you first need to create a new search string
[12:36:54] foolx: no problem, we will fix that ;)
[12:37:10] foolx: first: Create a new string. Which Language are you using?
[12:37:25] DanTester123: Selenium IDE...
[12:37:34] curseg has joined #selenium
[12:37:55] foolx: thats the tool, not a language ;)... but okay, i don't use ide anymore ... let's see ...
[12:38:10] DanTester123: cool
[12:38:55] foolx: have to take a look first, so could take a while.
[12:39:30] foolx: Baseidea would be to first create a new string, with partional strings out of your string. Afterwards you could use the new string as the search locator.
[12:40:13] DanTester123: wow, sounds complex
[12:40:31] foolx: not really. In java, it would be just 2-3 lines of code
[12:40:46] foolx: but in IDE you are a bit more limited (i guess, since i don't use ide)
[12:41:07] DanTester123: yeah, but is it possible?
[12:41:28] foolx: it should be possible somehow. Not as easy as directly in java, but possible
[12:44:45] DanTester123: <foolx> Go to go back in one hour, friends
[12:45:22] foolx: kk, i will see if i can find out what you need ;)

[20:08:09] barancev: yes, NativeDriver is good, but dead

[21:30:41] barancev: my file is slightly smaller
[21:31:34] eranm: I'd suggest just uploading the new webdriver-firefox-latest.dll if the tests are passing on your machine with Firefox 14
[21:31:49] barancev: and FF 13
[21:32:52] barancev: aha, I'll just make a copy of the DLL for 13
[21:32:58] barancev: and a new one for 14

[21:34:29] barancev: not yes
[21:35:20] barancev: yet, even
[21:35:34] barancev: I first run a single test that's the most critical and should fail immediately if native events are not loaded
[21:36:00] barancev: now to run all
[21:36:53] barancev: btw, if native events are not available, tests are not failing, they skip
[21:37:25] barancev: it's seems to be wrong strategy, i think
[21:37:35] eranm: There are few specific tests who do that
[21:37:49] barancev: exactly, and i run one of them
[21:37:52] eranm: Most tests will pass with native events and with synthesized events
[21:38:21] eranm: unless there's a failure to load the DLL , in which case all tests that require interaction will fail
