[14:44:23] eranm: What'd be the difference between using PostMessage and keybd_event ?
[14:44:27] jimevans: eranm: yep. i've been in pretty close contact with alexandr.
[14:45:25] jimevans: aside from the fact that the docs specifically say "this function has been superseded"?
[14:45:51] nacho has joined #selenium
[14:46:17] eranm: Ah, no.
[14:48:33] MadMerlin|work_ has joined #selenium
[14:50:53] jimevans: though i suppose it wouldn't hurt to apply the patch and give it a shot. the important thing is this: what does it do if the window you're automating doesn't have the focus? given that the api doesn't take a window handle, i strongly suspect that, just like SendInput(), it's injecting events into the keyboard event queue, which means that whatever window has the focus will receive the keyboard event.
[14:59:41] eranm: That would be sub-optimal
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jul  3 15:00:18 2012]
[15:00:18] eranm: keybd_event does not take a window handle
[15:00:44] jimevans: precisely.
[15:01:44] eranm: jimevans, re the proposal to add another thread that will just keep firing those events, can you think of a problem with this approach?
[15:02:08] hourback has joined #selenium
[15:02:53] jimevans: i'm not familiar with the proposal off the top of my head.
[15:04:03] eranm: Just start another thread in the IE server process that will keep calling PostMessage with the modifier key if a modifier key has been pressed. If the mouse is supposed to hover an element it'll post these messages to the window as well
[15:04:13] eranm: (mousemove? not sure which message type)
[15:04:55] jimevans: i'm not sure that's going to be reliable. the IE message loop is still going to fire WM_NCHITTEST messages every time it receives a WM_MOUSEMOVE message.
[15:05:21] eranm: jimevans, what's the implication of that?
[15:06:32] jimevans: if your mouse cursor is within the physical window boundaries, you'll have the effect of the cursor instantaneously jumping between the physical cursor location and the location you're sending during the WM_MOUSEMOVE.
[15:06:53] jimevans: essentially, it'll work just like it does now, but you'll get it repeating over and over several times a second.
[15:08:00] eranm: Could be a switched on only if the advanced user interactions are used
[15:08:20] opapo has joined #selenium
[15:08:30] jimevans: i still think the nchittest message is going to be processed last, but you can certainly try it.

[15:16:08] samuelgiles: HI everyone, where is the best place to discuss the web driver JSON wire protocol?

[15:18:49] Transformer has joined #selenium
[15:19:02] samuelgiles: jimevans: nice, :P it's essentially a question of documentation, the '/session/:sessionId/element/:id/elements' command has outlined a table noting the selector strategy and a description.  It doesn't make clear what the string value of the selector strategy should be in the JSON parameters, i.e. in the case of "link text" should it contain the space or should it be all one word?
[15:21:01] barancev: jimevans: eranm: re focus: don't forget about issues like #2353 or #2288

[15:22:25] jimevans: samuelgiles: the "using" value in the JSON body of the request should contain spaces, and be all lower-case. at one time the findElement atoms required that you translate those into camelCased versions, but i think the atoms have been updated to no longer require this.
[15:22:49] eranm: barancev, aye.
[15:23:28] jimevans: barancev: i've not been able to track that one down. in each of those cases, we're using the atoms, and the act of executing the javascript code there seems to drop the window to the bottom of the z-order. i'd be grateful for any insights anyone else has into the problem. :)
[15:26:56] samuelgiles: jimevans: ok thanks, I think this should be made clearer in the documentation, I assumed it was this, and it seemed to work :P (well it did).   What is the reason for adopting spaces over say something like "linktext" where we currently have "link text"?  Is it a case of backwards compatibility or readability? 
[15:27:41] eranm:  samuelgiles, why drop the space? n
[15:28:27] jimevans: samuelgiles: what are you working on that you need to be so close to the wire protocol?

[15:33:01] samuelgiles: eranm: my question is why not :P was there a conscious decision?
[15:33:36] samuelgiles: jimevans: I'm using the Facebook php-webdriver and it is basically a direct implementation of the JSON Wire Protocol so it is the only point of documentation
[15:33:54] jimevans: ah. right.
[15:34:08] *jimevans hates the Facebook php bindings for exactly this reason.
[15:36:21] samuelgiles: :P I am thinking of implementing a more object oriented approach in the future, but it's gonna have to be a personal venture I think
[15:37:58] jimevans: i think adamgoucher's bindings do exactly that.
[15:38:12] jimevans: but i could be mistaken
[15:38:14] samuelgiles: The Element34/php-webdriver is that ? 
[15:38:26] jimevans: yep, that's the one.
[15:39:13] jimevans: i've heard that there are no less than 6 different php bindings for webdriver. it'd be really nice if all those maintainers could get together and unify their efforts.
[15:39:46] samuelgiles: Yeh, I'm essentially using that, it's still pretty close to the JSON Wire Protocol, it's just less tightly coupled to it
[15:40:08] samuelgiles: yeh it would be nice, I wish I could use the Java bindings, :P but it's not down to me
[15:41:18] samuelgiles: Unfortunately the documentation seems a little weak on the php bindings side :P I'd definitely be interesting in a unifying effort

[16:26:01] dawagner: There are two of those elements on the page, the first is in the Flights tab, and hidden, the second is on the Hotels page, and visible
[16:26:13] dawagner: findElement returns the first element in the page which matches the property

[19:48:25] kallisti: Just for a bit of fun I wrote a simple selenium script in both the Haskell and Python libraries, for comparison: http://sprunge.u/sBDGV?python vs http://sprunge.us/UQei?haskell
[19:48:45] kallisti: very similar of course. the main difference I noticed was that I have to manually start the selenium standalone server in the Haskell version.
[19:49:09] kallisti: oh, hm. something weird happened with the indentation

[19:50:38] kallisti: hlep what is type URL I am ununderstand
[19:51:05] kallisti: the sleep might not be needed there.
[19:51:12] kallisti: I just added it as a precaution.
[19:52:54] kallisti: aside from the server startup code the logic is more or less the same.

[19:54:47] kallisti: I didn't test the Python one because my Python api is broken again and I don't remember how I fixed it.
[19:55:00] kallisti: I think it had something to do with Python version?
[19:55:13] Dude-X: you need python 2.6 for webdriver
[19:55:18] Dude-X: at the minimal
[19:55:23] Dude-X: and maximal is 2.7
[19:55:41] Dude-X: and you need 2.23 for ff 12/13
[19:56:11] kallisti: or greater? using selenium 2.4
[19:56:15] kallisti: *24
[19:56:27] Dude-X: or greater?

[19:56:59] Dude-X: latest release, release -1
[19:57:20] kallisti: Dude-X: ah my python selenium api probably is out of date.
[19:57:43] Dude-X: xpath = '//a[not @src]' might work
[19:58:04] Dude-X: you can check with webdriver.__version__

[20:01:31] Dude-X: well it might be close to something like //a[not contains(@href,'jpg')]
[20:01:32] Dude-X: or something
[20:02:24] Zack: what about in terms of cssSelector?  
[20:02:43] kallisti: you can't really do it in css selectors.
[20:03:20] Zack: well that's no fun lol
[20:03:46] Automate_: Dude-X: and esr
[20:03:48] Dude-X: css3 support is rather poor
[20:04:13] Zack: I usually use xpath but for this particular case being a dropdown menu css worked better
[20:04:15] Dude-X: Automate_: right, but i'd assume kallisti would use either latest or beta channel
[20:04:37] Dude-X: Zack, it's better to be specific on what you want to grab
[20:04:43] Dude-X: rather than what you don't want to grab
[20:04:48] AutomatedTester: you never know what these crazy kids use :)
[20:04:51] kallisti: I keep the latest standalone server around, but I'm less likely to update the official bindings.
[20:05:46] *kallisti hasn't been following development as closely as he should.
[20:06:21] Zack: I've tried to mark out a path that just focuses on a dropdown menu's links.. but it so happens there are image links as well that are causing me issues. I can't seem to eliminate the image links with a specified xpath or cssSelector
[20:06:38] kallisti: Zack: are these image links in the dropdown itself?
[20:06:43] Zack: yes
[20:06:43] barancev: what's the roadmap to 2.25? do we have any blocking issues?
[20:06:45] kallisti: you can use an element as the root for your query.
[20:06:46] kallisti: ah I see.
[20:08:08] Zack: and the problem is I can't use any static programming methods like id so I've been trying to find a way to exclude the images from the test

[21:02:10] *kallisti is tempted to write a C++ and perl webdriver client.
[21:02:15] santiycr has joined #selenium
[21:02:20] kallisti: for the perl one I have some non-traditional design ideas.
[21:02:25] kallisti: specifically, not object-oriented at the top level.
[21:02:53] kallisti: which is possible via dynamically scoped variables.
[21:05:30] Dude-X: C++ would be cool
[21:05:47] Dude-X: there is one perl client floating out there
[21:07:16] kallisti: essentially the idea I have for perl would be to emulate the way the Haskell library works.
[21:07:31] kallisti: so the top-level WebDriver are exposed as commands with an implicit state.
[21:07:43] kallisti: then elements, windows, etc can you use the object-oriented interface.
[21:07:58] kallisti: (which is where it deviates from the haskell design)
[21:08:15] kallisti: *WebDriver commands
[21:08:20] Dude-X: top level like JSON?
[21:08:34] kallisti: no top-level as in the methods of the "webdriver" class.
[21:08:38] Dude-X: oh i see
[21:08:46] kallisti: open(...)  instead of driver.open(...)
[21:08:58] kallisti: the way that would work is via dynamic scoping and higher-order functions, both of which perl can do.
[21:09:43] Dude-X: how would i know that open has to do with webdriver?
[21:09:58] Dude-X: a flat scope?
[21:10:06] kallisti: with_new_session (host => '...', port => '...'), sub { open "http://google.com"; find_element(css => '...'); };
[21:10:18] Dude-X: oh that makes sense
[21:10:23] kallisti: same way the Haskell interface works, except a bit hackier because of the dynamically scoped state variable that has to be introduced.
[21:10:43] Dude-X: well i'm going home, i can leave work early today
[21:10:46] Dude-X: :D
[21:10:47] kallisti: within the lambda there's a dynamically scoped "session" variable, and the symbol table is temporarily populated with those commands.
[21:11:10] kallisti: (the last part might not be necessary)
[21:12:40] kallisti: the equivalent Haskell would be:   newSession defaultSession defaultCaps $ do {openPage "http://google.com"; findElem $ ByCSS "..."}
[21:12:43] kallisti: very similar style.
[21:13:07] kallisti: the difference is that the perl version is more of a hack.
[21:13:46] kallisti: you might accidentally overwrite the dynamic variable if you're careless and don't use lexical scoping.
[21:15:39] detronizator: jimevans: still here?
[21:23:03] Chuckleteeth: JimEvanssssssss
[21:23:04] chrisculver701 has joined #selenium
[21:23:11] kallisti: it might be possible to avoid the dynamic variable via a closure.
[21:23:30] kallisti: but the dynamic variables make it painless to switch sessions mid code block.
[21:23:35] kallisti: local $session = $new_session;
[21:24:16] kallisti: whereas populating the symbol table with closures requires a new block:   with_session $new_session, sub { ... };

[22:14:08] Chuckleteeth: the element mouse over is flickering

[22:18:25] Chuckleteeth: but seeing as you are leaving in like 10 minutes
[22:18:32] Chuckleteeth: is there a tldr like oh hey it can't be helped?
[22:18:43] detronizator: jimevans: I'm going through your code
[22:18:44] jimevans: the answer is that mouse hovers suck in IE.
[22:18:57] Chuckleteeth: is there any hope i could get it working ?
[22:18:58] detronizator: the WebElement / Session relationship is a mistake I made in the beginning
[22:19:12] jimevans: move the physical mouse pointer outside the bounds of the IE window. that'll help
[22:19:18] detronizator: jimevans: before I know anything about the atoms
[22:19:19] Chuckleteeth: tried that
[22:19:37] jimevans: detronizator: heh. no worries. i just did the best i could to work around it.
[22:19:39] detronizator: jimevans: I plan at making WebElementReqHand much more "temporary" and have the locator as a factory of them
[22:19:53] jimevans: sounds reasonable.
[22:20:15] detronizator: jimevans: the webelementrequesthandler
[22:20:23] detronizator: should be reused instead of thrown away
[22:20:27] detronizator: or duplicated
[22:20:38] detronizator: but I think I can take care of that later
[22:20:46] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: the bottom line is that IE forces a redraw when it receives a WM_MOUSEMOVE, which is what tells it to reposition the mouse.
[22:20:53] detronizator: jimevans: I'll finish the review and let you know
[22:21:52] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: if you figure out a way to fix it, using native events, without forcing the IE window to be the focused window, i'll gladly review your patch.
[22:21:58] Chuckleteeth: you mean the WM_MOUSEMOVE event you send it with differant mouse coords then the physical mouse are overwritten almost immediately afterwards by the redraw event?
[22:22:01] nealstewart: jimevans: sorry to be a bother, but you seem like someone in the know and whatnot. is there no way to specify windows 7 when requesting from a selenium hub?
[22:22:03] jimevans: synthetic events for IE is something we're working on.
[22:22:05] kallisti: if I were to create a set of perl bindings would it be possible to make them "official"
[22:22:37] kallisti: I'm guessing some other selenium devs know perl.
[22:22:52] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: pretty much. "redraw" isn't really the right name. the blog post describes more in detail what's going on in the 3rd to last paragraph.
[22:23:23] jimevans: nealstewart: i know next to nothing about grid/hub.
[22:23:30] nealstewart: poopy.
[22:23:43] jimevans: detronizator: no worries. i'll fix that indetnationproblem.
[22:25:08] detronizator: jimevans: sorry jim, I might sound really annoying when I notice this stuff. I hope you can understand: I've a mild (not really mild) form of OCD

[22:35:18] Chuckleteeth: yeah i think some fishy identity theft stuff is going on here
[22:36:07] jimevans: detronizator: so when the window stuff gets done, you'll be remarkably close to having a driver that'll pass a decent portion of the java test suite.
[22:36:29] Chuckleteeth: the window stuff?

[22:39:00] jimevans: selenium conf rocked this year!
[22:39:36] Chuckleteeth: home itme.
[22:39:37] jimevans: ghostdriver is a webdriver interface to phantomjs, which is a headless webkit implementation.
[22:39:48] kallisti: looks like the existing perl binding is a flat wireprotocol implementation within a single driver object.
[22:39:52] kallisti: worst of both worlds. :P
[22:40:39] jimevans: i'm starting to have concern about fragmentation of language binding implementations. the php space alone is a nightmare.
[22:41:07] Chuckleteeth: btw
[22:41:12] Chuckleteeth: found a hack to fix the mouse hover issue
[22:41:15] kallisti: jimevans: is there any other space where it's a problem?
[22:41:16] Chuckleteeth: right click context menu!
[22:41:28] Chuckleteeth: seems to hold the hover
[22:41:36] Chuckleteeth: anyways, home time!
[22:41:59] kallisti: jimevans: my opinion is that if you create a good library no one will want to reimplement it. ;)
[22:42:12] jimevans: php is the poster child. i last counted 6 or 7 different bindings, none of whose owners talk to each other.
[22:43:25] jimevans: i also know of two or three different perl solutions (one is perl6, and under development by someone who frequents here occasionally)
[22:43:28] chainey1 has joined #selenium
[22:46:06] kallisti: perl6 counts as a different language.
[22:46:18] jimevans: as i'm given to understand
[22:46:45] kallisti: I doubt anyone has implemented a perl library as I intend to.
[22:46:52] kallisti: but I'm happy to communicate with other authors.
[22:54:49] kallisti: it'll mirror the Haskell library quite a bit, and rely on higher-order functions to make things like exception handling easier.
[22:55:13] kallisti: for example the common idiom of "close the session on any error"  can just be
[22:55:18] kallisti: close_error, sub { ... };
[22:55:22] kallisti: *close_on_error
[22:55:53] jimevans: sounds like that's doable, if that's a common perl idiom. i'm not a perl expert by any means.
[22:56:02] *jimevans hates timtowtdi
