[12:52:37] softmanpetro: how could I fill a input with a value ? with webdriver ?
[12:53:43] NeptuNooo: Chrome Driver: I'm wondering where to to disable 'translation bar' or ' remmember the password ? ' bar, which appear after entering some pages via Chrome webdriver. The problem is: Those bars appear with a slight lag after the page is loaded. When one of those bar appears, the whole page moves down, and this changes the position of elements. And the bug is: When i invoke 'click()' method on 
[12:53:43] NeptuNooo: a element, and meanwhile one of those bar appears, - the position the element changes - exception is thrown because driver clicks on empty space (button have moved down together with whole page)
[12:56:30] NeptuNooo: <softmanpetro>: you must use 'sendkeys(value) mehtod on the wanted input. This is well described on documentaion of webdriver
[12:56:58] softmanpetro: I use google bindings and it expects an array
[12:57:12] softmanpetro: array('123') .. and the input becamed 1000

[18:16:03] Gungy: hi simon
[18:17:45] Gungy: getting fustrated here - having moved from rc to webdriver, its still flaky - so ive compiled a script, it seems to run ok first time around, but if i re-run it again, it falls over complaining that it couldnt find an id on the page????!!!
[18:18:32] Zack: page load times differ?
[18:18:35] Gungy: ive even put in a wait for condition
[18:18:48] Gungy: what do u mean by that?
[18:19:12] Zack: sometimes the page isn't fully loaded before it tries to read an element
[18:19:28] Gungy: otherwise i will have to end up inserting a wait for before each of my commands it seems - really messy
[18:20:08] Gungy: so how do u get around making sure page is full loaded before i re-run my test?
[18:21:20] Zack: waitForElementPresent("element"); ?
[18:21:34] Gungy: thats what ive been using
[18:21:39] Zack: hmm
[18:21:54] Gungy: but i cant be using that with every element in my script
[18:22:06] Zack: well you could just throw in a couple Thread.sleep() just to see if that is the issue
[18:22:41] Gungy: ok i'll try that
[18:22:43] Gungy: thanks
[18:23:08] Zack: sometimes when I get an element issue like that I throw Thread.sleep() around to see if it is indeed a page load issue

[18:28:05] diminoten: if I wanted to capture outbound POSTs being made as a result of a click on a page, could I do that?
[18:29:37] samuelgiles: dimonten: Not with WebDriver
[18:30:38] diminoten: from what I'm reading I can capture the request headers at least, yeah?
[18:30:57] diminoten: or is that with RC
[18:31:13] samuelgiles: where did you read that? I'm not claiming to know web driver inside out, but I've never seen anything like that
[18:31:21] diminoten: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8363752/capturing-traffic-in-selenium
[18:31:34] diminoten: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5103127/can-selenium-monitor-xhr-requests
[18:31:41] diminoten: that second one's not in python tho
[18:32:11] samuelgiles: Yeh I think that's talking about RC: try Charles http://www.charlesproxy.com/ it's a proxy it's a must have for web debugging
[18:33:03] diminoten: there's this: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/py/_modules/selenium/selenium.html#selenium.captureNetworkTraffic
[18:33:27] diminoten: but you're right, it doesn't return the body
[18:33:29] diminoten: just headers
[18:34:08] diminoten: so basically you turn this on, click your button, grab the ajax request, then reform the URL yourself and resend to get the response
[18:34:25] diminoten: unfortunately I need that body...
[18:34:51] samuelgiles: In chrome it's got some pretty nifty network debugging stuff which means you can get the body?
[18:35:03] diminoten: manually yeah
[18:35:07] samuelgiles: I think you can do it in Firebug too, can't remember though
[18:35:16] samuelgiles: ohh you want to automate this :/ 
[18:35:18] diminoten: you're right it's really easy in the browser
[18:35:20] diminoten: haha yeah
[18:36:17] samuelgiles: Thing is WebDriver is designed to automate the browser from the users viewpoint, so I don't think this is the right tool for the job
[18:36:29] Zack: ^^
[18:36:36] diminoten: I don't understand
[18:36:38] sassda: which language are you using?
[18:36:43] diminoten: python
[18:37:11] diminoten: is it not part of the user's viewpoint to download files?
[18:37:25] rpereir__ has joined #selenium
[18:37:33] sassda: ok I am not expert in python, but I use node, the way I do it, is to create on the fly a small http proxy, then when I create my instance of webdriver I specify a proxy to use, and monitor everything that goes trough my proxy
[18:38:09] diminoten: yeah I could do that, I just didn't know I'd have to go through the trouble
[18:38:30] samuelgiles: Yeh a proxy really is the only way to get that information.  And yes it is the Users viewpoint to download files :P but that's hard to implement
[18:38:52] diminoten: oh yeah definitely
[18:39:06] diminoten: "not yet implemented" is totally cool with me
[18:39:12] diminoten: lest I demand my money back
[18:39:13] diminoten: :-P
[18:39:16] samuelgiles: :P

[19:49:30] jimevans: yep. back when we launched IE using CoCreateInstance, it would start invisible, as many COM servers do.

[20:16:30] simonstewart: We store the current browser (from the Browser enum) in "selenium.browser"
[20:16:44] simonstewart: It should be something like "ff" or "chrome"
[20:16:58] simonstewart: If that property isn't set, we return the current browser string
[20:16:58] jimevans: right, but we'll *always* return true, if we implement WrapsDriver, no?

[20:17:24] AutomatedTester: ooo my nodejitsu beta invite has arrived
[20:18:12] simonstewart: So that basically says "if we're using a WebDriverBackedSelenium or we're using RC in firefox chrome mode, we expect to be able to type into file input elements"
[20:18:28] jimevans: simonstewart: okay, that's what i thought.
[20:18:42] jimevans: IE webdriverbackedselenium will fail here.

[20:26:03] jimevans: simonstewart: that worked wonderfully, thanks.

[20:28:55] jimevans: jleyba: so if we were to want to do that in the IE driver, do we gain anything?
[20:31:48] jleyba: It can simplify a good bit, and you can rely more on the atoms to do the work

[20:46:37] Swadq has joined #selenium
[20:46:38] jimevans: i see. so the element reference cache is kept on the document then?
[20:46:44] jleyba: Yup
[20:47:00] jleyba: And would be gc'd with the document
[20:47:27] jimevans: nifty. and the injectable findElement atom handles that, i would imagine.
[20:48:00] jimevans: smallish problem with that is that the IE driver doesn't use the findElement atom for xpath or css.
[20:48:23] jleyba: Can you access a random property on the document through COM?
[20:48:44] jleyba: The cache is stored on document.$wdc_
[20:48:46] jimevans: should be able to.
[20:49:15] jleyba: and it's just string keys with element values, so if you can access it through COM...
[20:49:16] jimevans: if not, we could also execute javascript to get at it.
[20:50:10] jimevans: seems to me, though, that it's kind of an all-or-nothing thing. you either use the injected atoms for everything, or you don't at all.
[20:51:10] jleyba: all the webkit drivers use this approach
[20:51:20] jleyba: but they don't have any other way of accessing the DOM like the IEDriver
[20:54:52] jimevans: jleyba: the list of atoms the IE driver uses can be found in https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/cpp/build.desc almost at the very bottom of the file. are there corresponding injectable atoms for each of those?

[20:58:13] jimevans: but the assertions show identical values in the log for expected vs. actual.

[23:03:56] AutomatedTester: :note jarib thanks again for implementing bz api stuff! nice to see moz bugs in the channel
[23:03:56] selbot2: ok!
[23:04:19] AutomatedTester: those 2 bugs are the main ones that need implementing
[23:04:38] AutomatedTester: and then I will be an uber pedant on the marionette code base

[23:10:04] simonstewart: Looks like the new unhanded alert stuff has caused grief
[23:10:11] simonstewart: in the emulation

[23:19:12] *lukeis seeing jimevans using internal message board to talk about selenium progress == me so proud ;)
[23:19:31] *jimevans just wanted to beat lukeis to it for a change. :)
[23:20:14] simonstewart: Ha!
[23:20:38] Dude-X: what's R+?
[23:20:41] AutomatedTester: lukeis: what did he say?
[23:20:53] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: review approved
[23:21:17] AutomatedTester: r- == review declined
[23:21:22] lukeis: Just in case anyone missed it, the first public working draft of the W3C Browser Automation API spec was published today (http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-webdriver-20120710/). Why is that relevant here? It's a codification of the WebDriver API, on the road to becoming a W3C standard.

[23:21:39] lukeis: ^ that ;)
[23:21:43] jimevans: LOLz
[23:21:59] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: to apply any patch to Mozilla-Central, where Firefox lives, you need r+
[23:22:11] *AutomatedTester will apply 2 marionette patches tomorrow
[23:22:56] simonstewart: Argh
[23:23:23] simonstewart: The "Ignore" setting that barancev added for alerts doesn't appear to actually be ignored
[23:23:26] jimevans: simonstewart is down the rabbit hole, methinks.
[23:23:41] simonstewart: good point
[23:23:49] jimevans: in firefox, IE, or both?
[23:23:49] simonstewart: Let's unravel the stack a little
[23:24:05] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: if marionette is integrated into firefox, does that mean a special build will be available or will it be a part of regular release Firefox
[23:24:06] AutomatedTester: how can i help?
[23:24:07] simonstewart: Firefox
[23:24:25] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: this is what we are negotiating atm
[23:24:31] simonstewart: Let me make sure that I've not destroyed the real rc tests
[23:24:36] simonstewart: And I'll check in what I've done
[23:24:46] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: was that me to look at Firefox?
[23:24:49] simonstewart: After that "get the firefox-emulation-test" for RC working properly
[23:27:53] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: you can get it now if you download debug builds of Firefox
[23:29:05] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: also not all methods are there
[23:29:06] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: does tighter integration make Firefox webdriver tests less likely to flake? or is still subject to the same javascript issues
[23:29:26] AutomatedTester: depends what the cause of the flake is
[23:30:31] simonstewart: Alright. Checking in a bad revision
[23:30:39] simonstewart: So that anyone who wants to can take a look
[23:30:52] selbot2: 03simon.m.stewart half a minute ago - SimonStewart: Break ALL the RC tests, but allow others to grab the work so far | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=17408 | http://seleniumhq.org/ci.jsp?r=17408
[23:30:52] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: well maybe looking at the test suite that mozilla uses, have you observed less flakes?
[23:30:59] simonstewart: Basically, the RC tests (only tested on firefox) are broken in several ways
[23:31:10] simonstewart: 1) single window isn't single window
[23:31:21] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: we arent using it in anger yet
[23:31:23] simonstewart: 2) The proxy test fails with a security exception
[23:31:32] simonstewart: 3) I'm pooped. Off to bed
[23:31:39] AutomatedTester: waves simonstewart
[23:31:40] simonstewart: Once I've got everything ready for the morning.
[23:31:44] simonstewart: Toodle pip!

[23:33:18] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: I am working on the App store that mozilla is working on
[23:33:22] *lukeis thinks the last time i saw simon on this late was when he was in california....
[23:33:47] lukeis: wait, AutomatedTester you work on something other than webdriver? ;)
[23:33:57] AutomatedTester: and thats the first real desktop implementation of marionette in the wild
[23:33:59] jimevans: right. now i really *am* going. hopefully we'll get 2.25 out this week. :)
[23:34:02] Dude-X: app store for Firefox OS mobile users?
[23:34:11] jimevans has left #selenium
[23:34:13] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: for Firefox users
[23:34:26] Dude-X: ah
[23:34:34] AutomatedTester: it works on desktop, android and Firefox OS
[23:34:49] AutomatedTester: but the approach we are trying to push forward will be browser agnostic
[23:35:17] AutomatedTester: so it just relies on a file called manifest.webapp 
[23:35:34] Dude-X: if apple would allow such a thing, would they have done it for iOS?
[23:36:00] Dude-X: seems like it would be painful to support IE ;)
[23:36:06] AutomatedTester: and the browser interprets that to put something in the Applications/Program Files/ usr/local
[23:36:20] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: they want it, especially for Win 8
[23:36:31] AutomatedTester: chromeless browsers
[23:36:55] Dude-X: IE10 could be comparable to what we have now 
[23:37:26] AutomatedTester: I think the web is on the edge of really exploding
[23:37:47] AutomatedTester: becoming more than just this immense network
[23:38:09] AutomatedTester: the web will be a platform moving forward
[23:38:38] Dude-X: so now instead of typing http://.... it's going to be a mesh of browser + webapp that seems to go beyond the role of the traditional browser?
[23:38:51] AutomatedTester: yea
[23:39:09] AutomatedTester: instead of typing the url you just click the icon on your desktop
[23:39:17] AutomatedTester: the web will become desktop apps
