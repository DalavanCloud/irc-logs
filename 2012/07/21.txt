[02:25:08] goddard: why does the browser window need to be in focus ?
[02:25:49] goddard: im using the web driver so i can visually see everything but after it is setup properly should I do something else so it can just run in the background?
[02:27:41] stephend has joined #selenium
[02:32:01] Dude-X: are you on a mac?
[02:32:11] Dude-X: or windows?
[02:32:37] goddard: linux
[02:32:40] goddard: ubuntu
[02:33:20] Dude-X: i am able to do stuff without focus
[02:33:24] Dude-X: are you using native events?
[02:33:49] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[02:34:38] stockton has joined #selenium
[02:36:56] goddard: not sure 
[02:37:03] goddard: xpath?
[02:37:19] Dude-X: what language binding are you using?
[02:37:46] goddard: java
[02:38:00] stephend has joined #selenium
[02:38:02] Dude-X: then it's not using native events;
[02:38:08] goddard: ahh
[02:38:26] Dude-X: but now i know the problem you speak of
[02:38:34] Dude-X: yeah it will bring the browser to the foreground
[02:39:21] Dude-X: i don't really get around it, i just have two monitors to work with so I avoid the monitor with the active browser
[02:39:32] Dude-X: or move it to the other monitor
[02:39:38] goddard: ahh yeah good idea
[02:39:46] goddard: i have another one laying around i could use
[02:40:14] Dude-X: and man Java makes my head hurtâ€¦.
[02:40:42] goddard: well i am acustom to more c style structure so python and perl is annoying to me
[02:40:58] goddard: c# isn't really a good option on Ubuntu
[02:41:16] Dude-X: i love the Python
[02:41:26] Dude-X: i have to use Java at work though
[02:41:37] goddard: python seems like a good language but the structure makes it kind of a hassle for me
[02:41:38] Dude-X: makes me waste hours doing stuff in Java idioms
[02:41:45] Dude-X: whitespace?
[02:42:01] goddard: white space and just different ways of doing this
[02:42:03] goddard: things*
[02:42:11] Dude-X: it's not perl in that regard
[02:42:25] goddard: same basic structures and im sure i can pick up on it but this is for work as well
[02:42:29] goddard: and i already know java
[02:42:45] goddard: easy to link and include in your program right click in netbeans bam add jar and done
[02:43:27] Dude-X: problem with java is learing the language AND the infrastructure
[02:43:31] DaveIngram has joined #selenium
[02:43:55] goddard: i hate java but for tasks that dont depend on speed it is great
[02:45:03] Dude-X: i find java fast, when you put aside startup time
[02:45:27] goddard: well its fast enough for most tasks
[02:46:03] goddard: to bad PHP isn't more adopted on the desktop
[02:46:19] goddard: c style structure and java style classes and good documentation
[02:46:39] goddard: good scripting language
[02:49:02] Dude-X: funnyâ€¦ most programmers think PHP is a poor language, only merit is that it's everywhere and it has documentation, but it's not a logically consistent langauge
[02:49:14] santiycr has joined #selenium
[02:52:34] goddard: all other scripting languages didn't adopt the most basic structures of C which is what I love
[02:52:45] goddard: unless i dont know about it
[02:52:47] Dude-X: you should learn Go
[02:53:06] goddard: the google language
[02:53:10] Dude-X: yeah
[02:54:11] Dude-X: C has elegance in its structure, but it really is just a high level assembly language; it's not easy to pase int *(void *)(int, int) (int *, int*)
[02:54:21] xiaoli has joined #selenium
[02:55:10] Dude-X: and once you're exposed to a dynamic language
[02:55:23] Dude-X: you wonder if you can some better type flexibility
[02:55:29] Dude-X: can have^
[02:55:49] Dude-X: functional languages are interesting in that you can be a bit more exacting and what you want
[02:56:10] Dude-X: but it's also a whole different way of organizing your code, and managing state can be a bit challenging
[02:56:13] goddard: even javascript is more c like then python or ruby
[02:57:46] Dude-X: python has a lot of C influences in it still, but it's not C
[02:58:02] Dude-X: which i think is a good thing

[10:36:26] Manoj: Hello
[10:36:42] Manoj: ANy one know how to use Python with Safari ?
[10:36:56] slex: hi
[10:37:04] Manoj: i am not able to get through using SafariDriver with Python ?
[10:37:19] slex: is ther any difference of usage safari in python
[10:37:21] slex: ?
[10:37:47] slex: driver = webdriver.Safari()
[10:38:01] slex: or am i not right?
[10:38:23] slex: what error do you see?
[10:38:34] Manoj: No it didnt work.
[10:38:39] Manoj: i ahve done that 
[10:39:15] Manoj: driver = webdriver.Safari()
[10:39:18] Manoj: this is not woring
[10:39:33] Manoj: as per the syntax it should driver = webdriver.Firefox()
[10:39:44] Manoj: for Firefox it works fine. But not for Safari
[10:39:50] Manoj: Any help from any one ?
[10:40:16] Manoj: i have searched all over the Net but couldnt find any solution
[10:45:54] andreastt: AFAICT the Python bindings haven't got support for Safari yet.
[10:46:05] andreastt: Presumably you could use a remote driver for the time being.
[10:46:38] Manoj: ok
[10:46:54] Manoj: well can you please help me with how to do it ?
[10:47:02] Manoj: using remote driver ?
[10:47:33] andreastt: from selenium import webdriver
[10:47:43] andreastt: driver = webdriver.Remote(browser_name="safari", platform="any")
[10:47:56] andreastt: Make sure the Selenium server is already running before that.
[10:48:08] Manoj: sure.
[10:48:14] Manoj: Thanks a lot
[10:48:24] andreastt: Completely untested, though (-:
[10:48:40] Manoj: i ll do that now :)
[10:48:41] andreastt: No Safari for GNU/Linux for me to test.
[10:48:48] jibay has joined #selenium
[10:51:04] Manoj: driver = webdriver.Remote("http://localhost:4444/wd/hub", webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX)
[10:51:15] Manoj: this shld be fine i guess
[10:52:01] andreastt: For Firefox, yes.
[10:57:00] Manoj: the same command for safari didnt work
