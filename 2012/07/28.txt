[03:01:55] aces23up: hello, I want to run selenium grid on ec2, but I want to know how I can programmitacally add more vm/nodes if my hub has a certain load, and also remove nodes when the load decreases.. Hope this makes sense, is there a way to determine the hub load / how many tests are in queue?
