[00:01:02] Dude-X: i looked at the PageObjectFActory and saw that it did not fit our app
[00:01:11] Dude-X: but the idea of page objects is still great
[00:02:00] Dude-X: mozilla's page objects are a lot like mine, except that I have a wrapper to the main driver so that i don't have to keep typing the same kind of webdriver waits
[00:02:12] Dude-X: but mine are in java
[00:02:30] Dude-X: i would recommend using TestNG for a testframework
[00:02:44] Dude-X: my coworkers uses it on his project
[00:02:52] Dude-X: he does amazing things that makes me jealous
[00:03:43] somethingn: yea, I just used JUnit
[00:04:11] somethingn: this is really a summer job, so there wasn't a lot of time for wrappers and stuff, and we were already using JUnit elsewhere, for example...
[00:04:14] Dude-X: does junit have test discovery?
[00:04:22] somethingn: test discovery?
[00:04:33] somethingn: well, you make things with @Test, and they run
[00:04:35] Dude-X: say that you put your tests in a designated test folder
[00:05:06] somethingn: oh...well, I don't know, but I think so
[00:05:27] somethingn: we also use Eclipse, which does a lot of "useful" things more often than not
[00:05:30] Dude-X: a good test framework will be able to pick up all the files that are in the directory and then look for the ones annotated
[00:05:35] Dude-X: i use Eclipse too
[00:05:44] Dude-X: but i don't fully use all the featuers
[00:05:47] Dude-X: just don't have time
[00:05:57] somethingn: yea
[00:06:00] Dude-X: nor am i really that invested in learning that much Java

If you go to http://hub:port/grid/console,  yiu can see what browsers you have. You need to pick from that list, or change the node config

[12:31:52] andreastt: SamuraiJack: In your script, you're overwriting loggingPrefs in the capabilities, though.  On line 7.
[12:32:32] SamuraiJack: andreastt: looks the same
[12:32:57] SamuraiJack: andreastt: yes, that line I added later - same result with or without it
[12:33:35] SamuraiJack: I wonder if those messages can turned off at all
[12:33:58] SamuraiJack: they don't have the logging prefix: http://pastie.org/4289389
[12:34:00] andreastt: Which driver are you using?
[12:34:10] SamuraiJack: Chrome, IE, Firefox
[12:34:12] andreastt: Not all the driver implementations recognize loggingPrefs.
[12:34:19] SamuraiJack: Firefox is silent
[12:34:22] andreastt: I don't think IE does.
[12:34:37] SamuraiJack: IE and Chrome outputs a lot of debugging stuff, which I'd like to hide
[12:34:53] SamuraiJack: like "Started ChromeDriver, port=13472" etc
[12:35:37] andreastt: Not sure if ChromeDriver recognizes loggingPrefs.
[12:35:44] andreastt: I know that OperaDriver doesn't.  (Soon to change.)
[12:36:02] SamuraiJack: according to http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/wiki/CapabilitiesAndSwitches it does..
[12:36:25] SamuraiJack: but doesn't seems to work, heh
[12:36:29] andreastt: Ah, indeed.
[12:36:45] andreastt: Well, I'm not sure what goes wrong there then.
[12:37:01] andreastt: If Firefox is silent, I guess that tells you your code is right at least.

[15:51:44] Chuckleteeth: so dude-x, you are saying that they use jenkins to kick off tests
[15:51:51] jfinley: Ok thanks for your help. 
[15:51:53] Chuckleteeth: and it could potentially kick off more then one set of tests at the same time
[15:52:07] Dude-X: yes
[15:52:13] Chuckleteeth: but for an actual set of tests being run for selenium, none of those tests are parallizable?
[15:52:44] Dude-X: well if you want to a single process that will fire up multipleinstances, then it will have to be programmed that way

[15:52:59] Chuckleteeth: right

[15:53:01] Chuckleteeth: i understand that
[15:53:13] Dude-X: flyinprogramer: about?
[15:53:35] flyinprogramer: having to send javascript to driver to support something as basic as "onClick" 
[15:53:39] Chuckleteeth: so then really you could say that the tests are not parallelable and that i should not use them as a reference for parallel design pattern
[15:54:26] Dude-X: flyinprogramer: webdriver by default on Java will use "synthetic events" (aka pure javascript) to interact with elements. native events came a bit later but in my experience is a bit slower, doesn't work well on mac, and it's on by default for IE

[16:37:34] Dude-X: which chrome?
[16:37:34] Dude-X: ha
[16:37:44] Dude-X: just use chrome, it autoupdates
[16:37:53] Dude-X: and keep up to date with the latest chromedriver
[16:38:29] foolx: ah chromedriver ... okay, will look that up. IE 9 should work right?
[16:39:38] Dude-X: IE8 and IE9 should be decent
[16:39:51] Dude-X: IE9 32-bit would be the fastest
[16:40:08] foolx: Nice. But still unsure about Chromedriver. I have to use another server for that than normally?
[16:41:00] Dude-X: yes, also you need IEDriver/server
[16:41:13] Dude-X: it's no longer bundled in the latest selenium
[16:41:42] foolx: okay, didn't knew that. i thought, i could use IE/chrome like i use ff 
[16:43:31] Dude-X: firefox will eventually require the use of marionette enabled firefox
[16:43:37] Dude-X: but that won't be for a while
[16:44:51] WSelenium: by latest selenium do you mean 2.25?
[16:45:47] foolx: damn no, still testet 2.24
[16:45:54] foolx: so i have to update that too ;)
[16:46:05] Dude-X: 2.25 is the latest
[16:47:09] WSelenium: is it released though? reason I was asking if you were refering to IE no longer being bundled with the latest release is that the seleniumhq.org still has 2.24.1 as whats up on the site for download
[16:47:18] WSelenium: change log is up to date and has been for a while though
[16:47:47] Dude-X: go to the googlecode page
[16:48:06] foolx: do you have a link there?
[16:48:19] WSelenium: should be selenium.googlecode.com correct?

[17:14:50] dorwardv: hi lukeis what is meant by src$= ?
[17:14:59] foolx: until now i used only ff for testing. since i used only one PC for DEV and one for live, (with plans to do more) i run one hub on each. Afterwards i start another server with "browserName=firefox,maxInstances=5"
[17:15:08] Dude-X: src ends with the string
[17:15:17] lukeis: dorwardv: the attribute 'src' and the end of the string http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#selectors
[17:15:34] dorwardv: ok. thanks a lot
[17:15:58] lukeis: you can match the full path if you like... i'm just lazy ;)
[17:16:02] foolx: do i have to change this to browserName=firefox,maxInstances=3, browserName=chrome,maxInstances=3, broswerName=ie,maxInstances=3 or do i have to start 3 separate servers each with browser=ie/ff/chrome?
[17:16:35] Dude-X: for grid?
[17:16:43] Dude-X: on the node, just accept the defaults
[17:17:05] foolx: accept the defaults?
[17:17:05] Dude-X: it's only your test framework that can dispatch that many firefoxen
[17:17:35] Dude-X: which means that your test framework would have to fire up 3 −5 instances of remote webdriver
[17:18:00] dorwardv: @lukeis lazy is fine, and you just taught me another laziness skill
[17:18:29] foolx: yes, what it does from time to time ... but in future i will have to use ie/chrome and ff, so i want to change that a little bit to use 3 of each
[17:18:36] foolx: they normally won't run at the same time
[17:19:08] lukeis: dorwardv: there's no reason all of you selectors you showed in your gist can't be done with css (and will likely perform better/ faster if you do convert them)

[17:21:28] dorwardv: lukeis: will try, but maybe after the demo.  my CSS knowledge is very low.  seems like a very good investment for selenium
[17:22:15] lukeis: it is... and will help you, umm communicate? better with the UI dev's, they usually know css well (and not really xpath)
[17:23:11] foolx: okay dude-x, didn't get it
[17:23:51] Dude-X: on a grid node
[17:24:15] Dude-X: so on a grid node, it will default to a maximum of 5, but it won't spawn 5 instance automatically
[17:24:42] Dude-X: your test framework has to run 3 tests at once if you want to do 3 firefoxes on one box
[17:25:20] *stephend perks up
[17:25:22] foolx: k, i get that. ;) I already do more than one instance (ff) at the same time
[17:26:57] foolx: the grid itself won't do anything on its own, my framework has to tell it what to do. But when i use a grid to be able to use 2-3 pcs for the same build job, how can i use the same pc to create 3ff, 3ie and 3chrome? Most likely by starting 3 instances of selenium server with different settings for the browsers right?
[17:27:28] stephend: foolx: we use py.test, and that can drive multiple instances of firefox, for instance
[17:27:31] stephend: with -n X
[17:27:51] stephend: and no, should only need one grid hub set up, with however many number of nodes
[17:27:58] Dude-X: your code will only create 3 instances of the remote webdriver, all pointing to the same selenium hub server
[17:28:13] Dude-X: or 9 instances
[17:28:26] Dude-X: the hub figures out how to distribute the tests among the nodes
[17:30:37] foolx: sorry guys, i think you misunderstand me ;( i just want to know, how to configure selenium server (as server) to offer 3 ie, 3 ff and 3 chrome via the hub
[17:30:48] stephend: you register them
[17:30:57] stephend: with the nodes
[17:31:36] foolx: yes, but should i run 3 servers, one for each browser type or one server with all 3 allowed?
[17:31:55] stephend: what "servers" are you talking about?
[17:31:56] Dude-X: not as a hub? but as a regular server?
[17:31:58] stephend: one grid to rule then all
[17:31:59] Dude-X: hmm
[17:32:14] Dude-X: don't know if that would work...
[17:32:22] davehunt: one node (selenium-standalone-server) per machine/vm
[17:32:46] davehunt: and configure them using json config files
[17:33:11] davehunt: for example https://github.com/mozilla/moz-grid-config/blob/master/win7.json
[17:33:32] davehunt: that includes RC and WebDriver environments, with just a single 'server'
[17:33:42] davehunt: you can set the number of instances too
[17:33:49] Dude-X: stephend: on twitter you are following me but i can't follow you?
[17:34:18] stephend: make a request, and I'll let you follow me
[17:34:21] foolx: davehunt: never used json, using batch files for starting the server and grid
[17:34:22] *stephend protects his tweets
[17:34:38] Dude-X: how do i make a request?
[17:34:41] davehunt: foolx: you might want to check out that moz-grid-config repo
[17:34:53] Dude-X: i clicked on follow and it says pending, twitter app on iphone says forbidden
[17:35:09] davehunt: you'll want to use json files as otherwise there's a lot of stuff to pass on the command line
[17:35:34] Dude-X: can you link to the moz-grid as an example
[17:35:45] foolx: davehunt: looks nice, but i don't even know how i could start the server and grid with that
[17:35:46] stephend: Dude-X: done

[17:36:18] Dude-X: i just noticed my older brother is following me. didn't notice

[17:37:25] foolx: i will save that ;) 
[17:37:53] foolx: But are you sure this needs to be done? Seems a loooooot more work, then simply start the server via batch files like i did before
[17:38:16] stephend: we've scaled pretty well with moz-grid-config
[17:38:26] stephend: we started with batch/mac scripts too, of course
[17:38:43] stephend: foolx: to give you an idea of our scale, we have 7 mac minis
[17:38:49] stephend: with 4 or so VMs running Windows inside
[17:39:04] stephend: (4 total, not each)
[17:39:26] foolx: i used to need only ff (newest running version)... now they want to check on chrome/ie also. Maybe it's a little bit to much overhead, because nobody cares about the older versions at all
[17:42:04] davehunt: foolx: there's not a lot there at all.. json files and ant scripts (very similar to a batch script)
[17:43:25] foolx: yes, but also something more to do when installing a new selenium client for testing. Also something that i also can do with batch files
[17:43:40] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[17:43:41] davehunt: new client?
[17:43:50] foolx: new pc for testing
[17:44:03] davehunt: oh I see, just install Java/Ant and you're done :)
[17:44:14] davehunt: oh, well clone your repo
[17:44:26] davehunt: that's why we have a repo - it's centralized
[17:44:28] foolx: btw: "java -jar NODE01/selenium-server-standalone-2.25.0.jar -role node -port 5500 -browser browserName=firefox,maxInstances=3 -browser browserName="internet explorer",maxInstances=3 -browser browserName=chrome,maxInstances=3 -maxSession 4 -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register" does what i wanted to do: one pc, running all 3 instances at the same
[17:45:01] Dude-X: yuo
[17:45:05] Dude-X: yup
[17:45:17] davehunt: yep, not a particularly nice command line. at least store it in a repo somewhere :)
[17:47:19] foolx: doesn't have to be nice ;) It should just do what it is intended for ... isn't it?
[17:47:36] davehunt: that's true, but I wouldn't want to debug that :D
[17:47:46] foolx: ;)
[17:47:56] davehunt: it's exactly how we used to do it, too
[17:48:04] davehunt: but not for long :P
[17:48:17] foolx: i saved the wiki link and the link to the json. Will take a deeper look when i find the time.
[17:48:26] davehunt: k
[17:48:35] stephend: foolx: iirc, after we got to 3 boxes, we started looking into automating launching across all the nodes
[17:48:36] davehunt: we'll be removing RC support from that soon too
[17:48:41] stephend: s/launching/registering
[17:49:52] foolx: at this moment i have just 2 boxes. One DEV Box, now with ie,chrome and ff. And one LIVE Box. Looking forward to add 2 more boxes, so it will hopefully, be faster
[17:50:13] foolx: but even then i am quite happy with creating a grid, several nodes and just sending everything to the grid
[17:50:22] foolx: works good for me ;)
[17:51:09] foolx: We already tried to get VM working with selenium, but it just seemed to be broken. We got around 20% more errors while using VM then we got with real boxes, so we decided to not use VM anymore

[18:03:39] lawcab: i get org.openqa.selenium.ElementNotVisibleException
[18:03:40] Dude-X: look at the error messages that occur, they give a clue
[18:03:57] Dude-X: lawcab, wait for element visiblitiy
[18:04:06] lawcab: it is visible
[18:04:18] Dude-X: to your eye, or according to a function test
[18:04:30] foolx: Dude-X: the IE opens up, chrome isn't even opening. Think IE doesn't like the idea of callable futures
[18:06:34] lawcab: i now put 5 sec wait
[18:06:44] lawcab: and it still throws that error
[18:07:00] lawcab: firefox has no problem
[18:07:20] Dude-X: is your webapp using jquery or some js framework
[18:07:26] Dude-X: it might actually have a different locator!

[18:07:34] lawcab: what do you mean by platform=Windows
[18:07:37] slex: hi all
[18:07:42] Dude-X: lawcab: not for you
[18:07:56] lawcab: oh
[18:07:57] lawcab: sorry
[18:09:38] foolx: well, don't think i will solve the problem with ie and chrome in the next 5 minutes, so i think i will go into the weekend now and try again on monday

[18:10:45] julienresaas: @lawcab maybe try to do an explicit wait
[18:10:50] julienresaas: like what dude-x was saying
[18:10:52] julienresaas: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html
[18:11:29] lawcab: will try
[18:14:08] lawcab: tried the explicit wait
[18:14:12] lawcab: still the same error
[18:14:36] Dude-X: explicit wait is WebDriverWait, a thread.sleep is another alternative
[18:14:45] Dude-X: but the latter is terrible

[21:04:40] slex: could someone fix an issue with building selenium-server-standalone ?
[21:05:06] slex: hub is not started, with execption like: Error with the JSON of the config : defaults/DefaultNode.json is not a valid resource.
[21:06:14] slex: it's due r17520 changes. I fixed for current building by reverting change from this revision but not sure it's good decision.

[21:12:02] AutomatedTester: and then raise a bug and let me know the bug number
[21:12:41] slex: ok

[21:19:18] AutomatedTester: slex: i cant really see how that would cause an issue
[21:20:30] slex: defaults/* from this .desc file will copy all json etc files into root of created jar.
[21:20:57] slex: defaults/ will create defaults/ folder in jar and all json etc are there
[21:21:40] AutomatedTester: ahhh
[21:21:49] AutomatedTester: learn something new about crazy fun
[21:21:53] slex: i don't know how it works. maybe 17520 doesnt affect this but something else.

[21:50:31] Archdude_: is this a proper way to upload a file?
[21:50:32] Archdude_:         wd.find_element_by_id("f_emails_file").send_keys("emails.csv")
[21:51:44] slex: it should work. but it's better to use absolute path to file.
[21:52:47] Archdude: oh right

[21:54:32] jfinley has joined #selenium
[21:55:06] AutomatedTester: Archdude: that will only work if the file is next to the test
[21:55:30] Archdude: automatically generated the .csv in the same dir
[21:55:33] Archdude: but it didn't seem to work
[21:56:04] Archdude: works well w/ abspath though so i just had it do os.path.abspath in py
[21:59:52] AutomatedTester: Archdude: you can use __file__ to find where you are and navigate that way :)

[22:39:50] slex: could someone clarify - is this approach correct for adding logging options for iedriver ran via remote - https://gist.github.com/3153432 https://gist.github.com/3153440 ?
[22:41:30] slex: or should be LoggingPreferences capabilty used + implemented ability to copy log to client from remote node, something else ?

[23:40:19] rmcbride: ah shit. I'm much better at calling selenium webdrivers from python but I'll take a look
[23:41:07] stephend: python, nice
[23:42:32] rmcbride: I guess it really depends on the log usage. I don't see much of a reason to do it differently than your remote implementation for what I'd normally do, slex, but I can't pretend that I know all of the possible useage models for iedriver
[23:43:34] rmcbride: and I'd normally be doing remote anyhow because my jenkins servers would be native linux anyhow so ... yea
[23:45:05] rmcbride: oh also pardon the french above. looked in from another channel and forgot to self edit :(
[23:46:21] slex: ok. thanks. it's not urgent so it postponed until monday.
[23:47:19] rmcbride: Cool. hopefully someone smarter than me chimes in
