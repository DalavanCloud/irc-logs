[07:07:24] kallisti: I'm beginning to think selenium standalone is actually a virus.
[07:07:33] kallisti: given how many CPU cycles its churning through while idle.

[16:54:43] Dude-X_: kallisti, it's suppose to sit and listen to sockets, the JVM will optimize the code, and gc, but all of this should be 'amortized' with tiem
[16:55:42] kallisti: ah right it probably uses asynchronous IO
[16:56:23] kallisti: still. when there's no connections, I would imagine it just blocks on an accept() call.

[19:02:03] Dude-X_: kallisti, the act of blocking is an infinite loop
[19:02:13] kallisti: no it's not.
[19:02:25] kallisti: I mean, semantically it's very similar
[19:02:37] kallisti: but in terms of CPU cycles there's a huge difference in blocking on a resource and polling resources.
[19:03:36] Dude-X_: right
