[10:36:28] mikronaz: AutomatedTester: on IE there is option to change browser mode when clicking F12, and there is also option to change Compatibility View setting in Tools>Compatibility View Settings, ins't that different?

[10:47:14] AutomatedTester: via desiredCapabilities

[11:11:16] AutomatedTester: detronizator: hey
[11:11:25] detronizator: AutomatedTester: I got another driver-internals-quesiton
[11:11:35] AutomatedTester: kamoricks: IE10 is mostly done from what I understand
[11:11:39] AutomatedTester: detronizator: shoot
[11:12:11] detronizator: AutomatedTester: I create a driver instance, I create a window (the current one). Call it page A
[11:12:17] detronizator: page A creates a new window
[11:12:19] detronizator: page B
[11:12:23] detronizator: I swtich to B
[11:12:26] detronizator: switch
[11:12:33] detronizator: B creates a window C
[11:12:37] detronizator: now I got 3 windows
[11:12:47] detronizator: if I switch back to A
[11:12:50] detronizator: and I driver.close()
[11:12:57] detronizator: what is supposed to happen to B and C?
[11:13:15] detronizator: in other words: do we keep a parenthood-relationship?
[11:13:18] AutomatedTester: B and C should probably be open
[11:13:41] detronizator: so, you are saying, I should still be able to switch to them after I closed A?
[11:13:47] AutomatedTester: yea
[11:14:12] AutomatedTester: thats how I would interpret it
[11:14:14] AutomatedTester: andreastt: ^
[11:14:43] detronizator: I'll try and let you know
[11:14:53] detronizator: I think I might have to refactor the multi-window behaviour in PhantomJS
[11:15:07] detronizator: we, as a feature of Qt, have strong parenthood of windows
[11:15:11] andreastt: Yes, that's how I interpret it in OperaDriver too.
[11:15:32] andreastt: The API documentation says that #close() should only quit the browser if it's the last (of all) windows being closed.
[11:15:45] AutomatedTester: yea
[11:15:54] detronizator: andreastt: AutomatedTester: mmmh - sounds like there is a change needed in phantomjs than.
[11:16:06] AutomatedTester: since browsers are decoupling where possible each window is independent
[11:16:16] andreastt: detronizator: I essentially do if (getWindowCount() == 0) { quit(); } after closing the window.
[11:16:17] AutomatedTester: I think IE might be different for modal widnows
[11:16:36] andreastt: Yeah, modal windows might behave differently.
[11:17:45] detronizator: mmm - this needs a test
[11:18:01] detronizator: that I can launch against all the driver and  see the result
[11:18:12] detronizator: andreastt: AutomatedTester: thanks guys for the prompt help :)
[11:18:18] andreastt: Yeah, tests would be good.
[11:18:32] andreastt: I believe I wrote some for OperaDriver, should be easy to prot.
[11:18:35] andreastt: port also.
[11:18:36] kamoricks: AutomatedTester: It is, but it's not yet prettified.
[11:19:03] AutomatedTester: kamoricks: Windows 8 in general?
[11:19:03] andreastt: detronizator: Take a look at WindowTest if you're interested.
[11:19:24] detronizator: andreastt: ok - thanks :)
[11:19:28] *AutomatedTester is of the opinion Windows 8 will be another ME or Vista
[11:19:34] kamoricks: AutomatedTester: Yeah, in general. There's still some crashes, some usability issues, they haven't ported over accessibility, and nearly no windows bundle-software uses Metro.
[11:20:04] kamoricks: AutomatedTester: Really ruins the experience - part of the point of metro is you didn't have to use Desktop for everything, but until the software is updated, you still do.
[11:20:30] eranm: I'm just wondering if I'll finally get a decent x86-based tablet I can install Linux on
[11:20:40] kamoricks: eranm: Android is linux.
[11:20:46] AutomatedTester: eranm: why?
[11:20:50] eranm: from all of this rush by Microsoft to get a product on a tablet.
[11:20:51] andreastt: eranm: What's wrong with Nexus 7?
[11:21:29] eranm: Nothing wrong with the Nexus 7, it's a sweet little tablet and although Android in general is based on Linux, it doesn't have standard linux userspace (libc, etc).
[11:21:37] AutomatedTester: yes Googler, what is wrong with your new flagship product? :P
[11:22:22] kamoricks: eranm: Certain Windows 8 tablets will use x86 processors. You can install any SureBoot OS on them, which means any signed UEFI-certified OS with a boot sector. Red Hat has a valid cert, so everyone does.
[11:22:53] eranm: But well, it doesn't run Thunderbird and even if there are decent email clients, backing up / restoring them on Android is not a straightforward operation. On a standard Linux it's a single tar command and there are many other perks with a standard Linux .
[11:23:47] kamoricks: eranm: Well, android processors are standard arm regardless, and it's not like your linux of choice doesn't compile for arm. (Well, it might not, but vanilla kernel does, and debian ships a full arm-el distro)
[11:24:16] kamoricks: eranm: So the difference between Android/Linux and GNU/Linux is the lack of GNU, which can be installed.
[11:25:29] kamoricks: So there are tons of linux-capable tablets out there - just shy of all of them. (Windows Phone 7 are the stupid ones with the locked-down bootloader and weird hardware.)
[11:25:31] eranm: kamoricks, you're right - it would be interesting to see how Linux distros fare on arm machines built for Windows RT. I can do without an x86 processor for most things. But when the firmware loader for your wireless USB adapter does not work because of endian-ness issues, tha'ts simply annoying.
[11:25:45] kamoricks: eranm: I've ran debian-armel on an embedded device, and pretty well, actually.
[11:26:03] kamoricks: eranm: We *did* have to code a few device drivers.
[11:26:04] eranm: One with a screen and keyboard you interact with regularly? 
[11:26:33] kamoricks: eranm: It had a screen, a serial port, a USB wifi dongle, and a verizon 4g modem.
[11:26:36] eranm: It runs perfectly fine on the raspberry pi and other assorted arm-based devices I have, but they're all headless systems
[11:26:55] kamoricks: eranm: No keyboard, though.
[11:27:14] eranm: Touchscreen keyboard have been Linux's weak point up until Android
[11:27:26] kamoricks: eranm: Honestly, it'd probably be better to just install GNU on an Android/Linux platform.
[11:31:23] eranm: Not sure it'd be as easy as 'apt-get install' whatever package I want. And the android-specific bits would still be there. 
[11:31:53] eranm: andreastt, have you got yourself a Nexus 7 already?
[11:32:08] kamoricks: eranm: Well, you'd have to install apt first, but apt runs pretty-okay on non-Debian systems. And you wouldn't be able to run anything X-based, but you probably wouldn't be able to do that anyway.
[11:32:26] kamoricks: eranm: And yeah, the android stuff would still be there, but "my computer does too much" is an odd complaint.
[11:32:38] andreastt: eranm: My GF says no )-:
[11:32:51] andreastt: Too many gizmos already.
[11:33:04] kamoricks: eranm: I'm seeing successful forum reports of a debian package manager install on 4.x rooted devices.
[11:33:55] eranm: andreastt, well known problem. It's a pretty good tablet though - I did get rid of my 10" tablet, a 7" one is a perfect replacement
[11:34:45] andreastt: eranm: When her iPad 2 breaks, we can get it.
[11:34:51] andreastt: Not that I'm making any sinister plans.  At all.
[11:35:14] eranm: Heh

[11:52:16] kamoricks: I frequently find myself waiting for a page to load. In order to do so, I select an element whose name is 'body'. However, I intermittently have NoSuchElementFoundExceptions when testing with firefox. Why?
[11:52:19] AutomatedTester: emmasoderberg: if you see http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/list the commit messages dont explain what you were doing
[11:52:34] kamoricks: My best guess is that firefox actually loads two pages - a blank page, then the target page. Is this accurate?
[11:53:51] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[11:53:54] emmasoderberg: AutomatedTester: Ah, yes, thanks :) I went ahead and added some clarifying comments on the commit but you only see them when you click on them...
[11:54:09] eranm: kamoricks, you may be loading other resources (tracking code, ads) from third-parties that sometimes time out
[11:54:43] AutomatedTester: emmasoderberg: cool
[11:55:16] eranm: kamoricks, you should be waiting for the element you want to interact with
[11:55:53] kamoricks: eranm: Issue persists, with a different name.
[11:56:35] kamoricks: eranm: If it was a timeout, that'd be one thing, but the time it's waiting is less than the implicit wait time I've defined. The only time I can reproduce that is if I ask for an element from an old page if a new page has loaded.
[11:58:28] eranm: kamoricks, not sure I understand the problem. Code snippet?
[11:58:45] kamoricks: eranm: It's in PHP. Is that fine?

[14:00:55] andreastt: Okay, next problem on the agenda: Opera Mobile is too fast.  How can I slow it down?
[14:01:31] andreastt: Technically the Java code is too fast.
[14:01:35] AutomatedTester: what is this "too fast" you talk about
[14:02:02] AutomatedTester: andreastt: its not waiting for the reply?
[14:02:16] andreastt: There's a race condition during initialization where Opera says it's ready, but where the product UI thread isn't really.
[14:03:34] AutomatedTester: have a callback to tell you when the UI thread is initialised?
[14:03:56] andreastt: Scope (or Core) doesn't concern itself with what the product code does.
[14:04:06] andreastt: So to do that you'd have to knock through a couple of walls.
[14:04:31] AutomatedTester: andreastt: does core understand JS
[14:04:44] andreastt: Yeah
[14:05:07] andreastt: But it will complain if I try to execute JS as well, because without a window there's no JS runtime available
[14:05:24] andreastt: And besides, this is before the JS service has been initialized
[14:05:40] AutomatedTester: rock > andreastt > hardplace
[14:07:10] AutomatedTester: andreastt: what does the initialization part look like
[14:07:24] AutomatedTester: what steps happen
[14:08:48] andreastt: So we connect to Opera, enable a metaservice which allows us to enable other services.  We tell it to enable the window manager in Opera, but this call is apparently not blocking.
[14:09:11] andreastt: So OperaDriver rushes along
[14:09:49] andreastt: Opera in the meantime has to open the UI, and before it gets to doing that it gets a request from the driver telling it to initialize the windows.  But there are not yet any windows to initialize.
[14:12:23] rpereir__ has joined #selenium
[14:12:51] AutomatedTester: andreastt: can you test how many windows are available?
[14:13:03] AutomatedTester: assuming that when the UI isnt running it will be zero
[14:13:43] andreastt: Hm, yes.  Good idea.
[14:13:49] andreastt: Not certain I can get that information, but will look.
[14:14:35] AutomatedTester: andreastt: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/marionette/marionette-actors.js#252 <- get the enumerator and if you try enumerate and dont go anywhere its not ready
[14:14:52] AutomatedTester: but the Opera version of that
[14:15:38] andreastt: Scope is pretty different from that.
[14:16:00] jimevans has joined #selenium
[14:16:11] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I more meaning the concept
[14:16:58] andreastt: Our window manager uses an opt-in filter approach.  We tell Opera which windows we want to include in our monitoring.
[14:17:09] andreastt: Then Scope will send us updates whenever something happens to those window runtimes.
[14:17:30] AutomatedTester: can you optin on initialization?
[14:17:31] andreastt: That way we can potentially reduce network overhead.

[14:37:07] mdgreenfield has left #selenium
[14:38:25] andreastt: AutomatedTester: I think I found the solution.  We need to change the window manager to not throw errors when attempting to get the active window.  Then we can have a blocker in driver waiting for it to get ready.
[14:40:03] AutomatedTester: andreastt: why change it, if you are getting errors just hang about till the errors go away?
[14:40:55] andreastt: That's not trivial, because the Scope proto is not blocking.
[14:41:16] andreastt: So the error response would get caught in another thread.
[14:41:27] AutomatedTester: ok
[14:42:41] andreastt: No wait, I can actually do that because protobuf is so awesome.
[14:42:43] andreastt: :D

[14:45:13] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I think changing it not to throw errors could open a can of worms
[14:45:55] andreastt: Possibly.  But catching an error always invovles the danger of catching too much stuff.
[14:46:11] andreastt: I'm discussing the possibility of changing it so that it returns 0 if no active window is available.
[14:46:40] AutomatedTester: ok

[15:56:12] ancduval: Hi. I'm using Selenium Webdriver (Java) to start my browser and log me in to a website. Is it possible to make the Java code wait for the user to close the browser, and then exit?
[15:56:20] toehio_: andreastt: how about when you explicitly move it, out of an action chain. For example, you know there is a div 300px below, so you move the cursor 300px down and click. Does webdriver scroll the area that is 300px down up, and then move the cursor?
[15:57:03] ancduval: If I just let main() return in Java, my browser stays up, but when I close it the Java process doesn't finish (and uses up memory)
[15:57:07] jfunk has joined #selenium
[15:57:52] andreastt: ancduval: With some drivers you can detach the browser when the program finishes, but that's not really what you asked for.
[15:57:56] ancduval: My use case is: I call my Java program with a keyboard shortcut, use the browser, close it when I'm done; repeat all steps several times during the day
[15:59:17] WSelenium: ancduval: But your java program continues to run in the background after you've closed out?
[15:59:29] ancduval: those java processes pile up and use a lot of RAM. I'm using Chrome on Linux, if that makes any difference. I'm wondering if this is a valid/supported use case; I haven't found anything with Google
[15:59:38] andreastt: ancduval: I guess you could run WebDriver in a thread and catch any exceptions on it closing the connection, though.
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Jul 27 16:00:13 2012]
[16:00:13] andreastt: toehio_: Using the Mouse interface directly?  No.
[16:00:20] WSelenium: andreastt: could it be the chrome server that is run, not closing and keeping the java process running?
[16:01:06] andreastt: I don't know the ChromeDriver that well, but in theory yes.  You'd just treat WebDriver as any other thread.
[16:01:55] andreastt: With Opera you can query whether the binary was quit, I'm not sure if that's possible with Chrome.  Anyways, catching should do the trick.
[16:06:01] WSelenium: I just ran the chrome version through java, until the ChromeServer is closed it will keep the java process running, the ChromeServer is what is running in the background as well
[16:06:31] ancduval: WSelenium: andreastt: thanks for looking into this. I'm basically doing: http://pastebin.com/t2pHznkX
[16:06:55] WSelenium: ancduval: in your processes is ChromeDriver running?
[16:07:03] ancduval: straightforward, like the tutorials/examples. If I exit main() without calling driver.quit(), both the java process and the browser keep running
[16:07:54] ancduval: If I close the browser, the Java process keeps running, though it prints:
[16:07:56] ancduval: [0727/181312:ERROR:automation_proxy.cc(367)] Channel error in AutomationProxy.
[16:08:02] ancduval: (exe:3778): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_object_unref: assertion `G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed
[16:09:38] ancduval: WSelenium: yes, after I close the browser the "chromedriver" process is still running (until I kill the Java process with Ctrl+C)
[16:10:39] WSelenium: ancduval: try closing the browser then killing the chromedriver process instead the java process as a test and let me know if the java process ends

[16:12:29] DaveIngram has joined #selenium
[16:12:49] ancduval: WSelenium: after I kill the chromedriver process the Java process ends
[16:12:59] ancduval: If this is not intended/known usage, I'll have to deal with it. If you can point me to some explanation about the threads you mentioned earlier, I'd appreciate it (I liked to pastebin to show that only implicit threads could be keeping the Java process up, I'm not creating anything explicitly)
[16:14:15] WSelenium: I second that, would love to know how to end the chromedriver at the end of a java process in the code
[16:22:08] ancduval: just to make it clear to anyone reading the logs, all processes exit if I call driver.quit() at the end of the Java code. But I'm trying to keep the browser alive so I can use it, which I why I don't call that
[16:31:17] cgoldberg: ancduval, driver.close() just closes current window... does that help?
[16:33:20] WSelenium: ancduval: does the test have to happen using Chrome?  I know Chrome is 3rd party,  you can do the same with Firefox on a linux box and do exactly what you want to do, and closing the browser manually(and not calling driver.quit) will end the java process.
[16:34:17] ancduval: cgoldberg: I've tried close() and it closes the window (but I want to keep it open)
[16:35:12] ancduval: WSelenium: thanks, I'll also try Firefox. In the meantime, I've found a workaround for my usecase (having a keyboard shortcut to start a browser, log me in to a website):
[16:35:47] ancduval: the script that starts selenium to perform all these operations first does "killall chromedriver". that way, only 1 Java process stays hanging
[16:36:32] ancduval: if I close the browser and start it up again several times during the day, every new invocation kills the previous hanging processes. which solves my use case :)
[16:36:38] ancduval: Thanks guys :)

[18:20:28] jleyba: detronizator: I'll try to answer best I can
[18:21:01] detronizator: jleyba: phantomjs is headless. those commands to manipulate position and size are mostly "meaningless"
[18:21:17] detronizator: jleyba: is it better to throw an "command not implemented/supported" error
[18:21:25] detronizator: jleyba: or fake success?
[18:22:14] jleyba: detronizator: what happens in phantomjs if I query window.screenLeft?
[18:22:29] jleyba: or use window.resizeTo/moveTo?
[18:22:35] jleyba: are they quiet no-ops like in chrome?
[18:22:47] detronizator: didn't try
[18:22:56] detronizator: but I'd assume they are no-ops
[18:23:06] detronizator: as they will be passed up to the Qt Widgets layer
[18:23:12] detronizator: that we purposely don't implement
[18:23:14] jleyba: how do screenshots work for ghost driver?
[18:23:16] detronizator: hence, will be ignored
[18:23:18] detronizator: yes
[18:23:22] detronizator: you can resize
[18:23:24] detronizator: that's for sure
[18:23:36] detronizator: but moving around or maximize is "meaningless"
[18:24:16] jleyba: to avoid users having to special case ghostdriver in their tests, I would have maximize & setPosition be a no-op and getPosition always return (0,0)
[18:24:56] detronizator: I was going to do just that! I just wanted the opinion of one of you
[18:24:58] detronizator: :)

[21:53:16] simonstewart: Which is about his normal time
[21:53:47] lukeis: yikes... no jet lag.... does not bode well for parents who will have that jet lag
[21:54:20] lukeis: i'm really hoping to keep my kids semi close to pacific time... that way they'll be up late and sleep in ;)
[21:54:25] simonstewart: I was up at 5.15
[21:54:27] simonstewart: So not too bad

[22:00:27] Dude-X: AutomatedTester:  i heard that untll recently, (like the 90's) French was considered the universal langauge of the world
[22:00:41] Dude-X: even american passports had stuff in french
[22:00:43] simonstewart: Dude-X: ?
[22:00:53] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: my annoyance is not at there being french
[22:00:53] simonstewart: French was one of the three main languages in the EU
[22:01:11] AutomatedTester: just announcements should be in english first
[22:01:22] Dude-X: i understand…. when in England, speak English first
[22:01:23] AutomatedTester: host country first then all the other languages they want
[22:01:26] Dude-X: i agree with that sentiment
[22:02:16] jimevans: de Coubertin (Father of the modern Olympic Movement) was French
[22:02:37] jimevans: the host country always goes last for everything.
[22:02:52] AutomatedTester: the olympics can go fuck themselves then
[22:02:55] Dude-X: "we save the best for last"
[22:02:55] jimevans: visitors first. :)
[22:03:03] jimevans: unfailingly polite and all that.
[22:03:27] AutomatedTester: I have had enough of the olympics
[22:03:44] Dude-X: i think what's more terrible than the olympics (which is not a bad thing in itself) is the security state in London
[22:03:57] jimevans: for what it's worth, for countries where the native language is not french or english, announcements are made in three languages, again with the host country being last.
[22:03:59] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: definitely
[22:04:30] *jimevans is something of a junkie about olympic traditions and protocols.
[22:05:05] jimevans: but now i gotta jet. have a good weekend everybody!

[22:23:09] simonstewart: But wasn't that in the past?
[22:23:15] simonstewart: June 15-16th
[22:23:15] simonstewart: ?
[22:23:24] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: that meetup was in the past
[22:23:30] simonstewart: ah
[22:23:31] AutomatedTester: they are organising a new one now
[22:23:35] simonstewart: Ohhh...
[22:23:37] simonstewart: interesting
[22:23:39] simonstewart: when?
[22:23:52] AutomatedTester: just before W3 meeting in France
[22:24:14] AutomatedTester: before TPAC
[22:24:22] AutomatedTester: I dont know where they are holding it
[22:24:27] simonstewart: France?
[22:24:28] simonstewart: :)
[22:24:30] AutomatedTester: but that is what I am doing to help
[22:25:03] Dude-X: what's the use case of executeJavascriptAsync?
[22:25:06] AutomatedTester: because they will need a browser automation framework to test it
[22:26:06] Dude-X: is it simply a nonblocking call?
[22:26:12] simonstewart: Dude-X: when you want to wait until an ajax call returns
[22:26:15] simonstewart: (for example)
[22:26:28] simonstewart: Dude-X: it's a non-polling call
[22:28:23] Dude-X: so in the execution of the test framework, you call executeJavascriptAysnc, it will send the command to the browser, but instead of waiting for a response, it returns back to the test framework, and then executes the next command, and then presumably, you can call executeJavascript to check the value later?
[22:28:33] Dude-X: check the result of the prior call
[22:31:09] lukeis: no, that's not the intention of it
[22:31:41] lukeis: it's so you can do asynchronous javascript, with a blocking webdriver call
[22:32:39] Dude-X: can you give me a contrived example?
[22:32:47] Dude-X: or a real case based on something you've done?
[22:33:06] lukeis: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/JavascriptExecutor.html#executeAsyncScript(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object...)
[22:33:23] lukeis: i've never come across a real use case in my tests
[22:33:32] Dude-X: when did java docs get pretty?
[22:33:33] lukeis: i've pointed one user at it in IRC before
[22:33:50] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: simonstewart did the JavaDocs with Java 7
[22:33:51] lukeis: when simonstewart upgraded it in the last release :)
[22:34:12] simonstewart: Yeah. Sorry
[22:34:22] lukeis: don't be... looks good :-D
[22:34:27] simonstewart: I'll be sure to use java6 next time and uglily them again
[22:35:51] whompwhomp has joined #selenium
[22:35:56] lukeis: simonstewart: that method name seems to confuse many people into thinking it's a non-blocking call... even adamgoucher thought so (until the last selenium meetup ;) )
[22:36:08] simonstewart: *sigh*
[22:36:25] whompwhomp: is there a way in the selenium ide to check whether or not a certain bit of raw source code exists? specifically, i need to test if google analytics code exists
[22:37:32] lukeis: whompwhomp: use a css (or xpath if you must) selector to find the element.... css="script[src*='googleanalyticsurl']"
[22:37:52] whompwhomp: kk thx
[22:37:53] lukeis: presenceOfElement is something
[22:38:10] whompwhomp: you verifyElementPresent?
[22:38:12] whompwhomp: *you mean
[22:38:23] lukeis: yeah, maybe that... i don't use IDE ;)
[22:38:36] whompwhomp: lol kk thx
[22:40:14] Dude-X: lukeis: after reading the doc, I think it waits for a callback to comeback
[22:40:21] lukeis: it does
[22:40:33] Dude-X: that's cool. so it's useful when you want to wait for the callback to be activated
[22:40:41] lukeis: yup
[22:40:49] lukeis: like trigger an ajax calll
[22:40:57] Dude-X: otherwise, without the async part, any function calls will be exceuted immediately
[22:41:20] Dude-X: and will return according to it's programming.
[22:42:32] Dude-X: lukeis: I've created some webdriverwaits using executeJavascript…. does that mean I can i use executeJavascriptAysnc and just use a custom function to wait for a specific value?
[22:42:50] Dude-X: a string that represents a function to wait for an expected value
[22:43:13] lukeis: yep... so all the waiting can be done in js, rather than polling
[22:43:22] Dude-X: that is pretty cool!!!
[22:43:44] *Dude-X note to self, really learn Javascript, for realz
