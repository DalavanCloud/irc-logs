[14:16:03] JavaDan: Hi everyone!
[14:16:32] testingb0t: Hello
[14:17:26] JavaDan: Need some help with my test, I'm trying to click a button on a website - but Selenium IDE keeps saying [error] Invalid xpath [2]: //html/body/form/div[2]/div[4]/div[5]/div/div/div[3]/div/ul/li/a
[14:17:44] JavaDan: The website I'm testing is ... http://www.appliancesonline.co.uk/washing-machines/washing-machines.aspx?cmredirectionvalue=Washing%20machines
[14:23:20] JavaDan: Does anyone know about this, please?
[14:25:04] testingb0t: maybe try coming up with a simpler xpath ? or use css instead of xpath
[14:26:05] JavaDan: [error] Invalid xpath [2]: //div[3]/div/ul/li/a
[14:26:12] JavaDan: [error] Invalid xpath [2]: //a[contains(@href, '#tab-1')]
[14:26:26] JavaDan: [error] Invalid xpath [2]: //div[@id='headerSlider']/ul/li/a
[14:27:31] JavaDan: Its very differcult for me, to get Selenium execute this.
[14:30:30] testingb0t: css=a.spec-link-1.washmachbtn
[14:30:32] testingb0t: did you try that?
[14:31:07] JavaDan: :-(
[14:31:09] JavaDan: [error] Element css=a.spec-link-1.washmachbtn not found
[14:32:59] testingb0t: works for me
[14:33:38] JavaDan: Using the clickAndWait command
[14:34:24] testingb0t: yes
[14:36:14] JavaDan: Ok I can send you a link which will display the html, for my test, would that be ok?
[14:36:47] testingb0t: ok
[14:36:48] JavaDan: The is Step 1#
[14:36:50] JavaDan: Goes to ‘performance.appliancesonline.co.uk’
[14:36:57] JavaDan: The is Step 2#
[14:37:04] JavaDan: Searches for “Washing machines”
[14:37:11] JavaDan: The is Step 3#
[14:37:19] JavaDan: Uses the filter navigation on the left to filter on only washing machines that are available ‘Next Day’
[14:37:26] JavaDan: End Test
[14:38:04] JavaDan: http://pastebin.com/RGJRjRxT
[14:39:53] testingb0t: the test from the pastebin website ran successfully for me, Selenium IDE 1.8.1 with Firefox 13
[14:40:30] JavaDan: :-(
[14:40:42] JavaDan: why not for me?
[14:43:32] JavaDan: I just don't understand it
[14:45:57] JavaDan: I think my problem was I need to open 'Blank' webpage first

[16:58:57] Dude-X_: please ask :D
[IRC logfile - Started Sun Jul 15 17:00:07 2012]
[17:00:07] sixpindin: I'm a noob programmer and I've built this automation framework (if you could call it that) in c-sharp. One of the features is that it uses web-driver and the html-agility-pack to construct a 'page' object which can be interacted with by programmers and testers who're using specflow
[17:00:25] sixpindin: specflow is a gherkin parser for those who don't know
[17:00:45] Dude-X_: does it have test discovery?
[17:00:55] sixpindin: What's test discovery?
[17:01:11] Dude-X_: you have a whole bunch of tests in your source tree
[17:01:25] Dude-X_: test discovery is just a way to automatically find all the tests in your source tree
[17:02:36] SamuraiJack_ has joined #selenium
[17:03:06] stockton has joined #selenium
[17:03:16] sixpindin: I'm trying to figure out the best way to construct the 'page' class. At the moment, I get the source from webdriver, then create a whole bunch of objects (dropdowns, text-boxes, etc) based on HTML-agility-pack nodes. I then interact with these using the webdriver (finding them by xpath, which the agility-pack provides) - I've also come up with a couple of ways to give these objects clever nicknames based on assosiations with labels on the pa
[17:03:53] sixpindin: So users can basically say "I enter {text} in the 'first name' textbox" and it just works, most of the time
[17:04:16] Dude-X_: what if you have ajaxy webpages?
[17:04:25] sixpindin: That's the beatuty
[17:04:41] sixpindin: It doesn't matter, I just refresh the 'page' - but this is leading to my question
[17:05:22] sixpindin: If the page changes, I just recreate the 'page' class, and all the new elements are updated (as I get the source again)
[17:05:43] Dude-X_: sounds really slow
[17:06:22] Dude-X_: are you just updating locators, or do you relocate the elements (driver.findElement)
[17:06:33] sixpindin: I'm trying to figure out how to represent a 'page' - As page is (what with ajax, etc) not static anymore, it's more like a bunch of elements, or states
[17:07:07] sixpindin: It's very fast. I only interact with webdriver once when i refresh the page (to get the source) then everything else is done with html-agility-pack.
[17:07:44] Dude-X_: that's a hard question to answer...
[17:07:45] sixpindin: If I want to interact with an element on the page, then I just get the xpath) from the agility-pack, and ask webdriver to interact with the element.
[17:08:01] sixpindin: See, I was using a hash of the page elements
[17:08:08] sixpindin: but they change 
[17:08:12] sixpindin: So it's more like states
[17:08:48] sixpindin: I'm stuck on the best way to construct my 'page' class
[17:08:53] sixpindin: Sorry, 
[17:09:22] Dude-X_: i've heard of people writing tools to automatically create the page objects, but they never quite told me their secret sauce
[17:09:24] sixpindin: it's maybe a question that I'm faced with only because of going about things the wrong way. Although it's really cool right now.
[17:10:10] Dude-X_: though as i am working on a heavy ajax app, I find that i occasionally i have to execute javascript because web driver  can't deal with the state changes
[17:10:35] sixpindin: This was why I went this route (one of the reasons)
[17:10:42] sixpindin: I'd be more than happy to share all the source
[17:10:42] SamuraiJack_ has joined #selenium
[17:11:28] Dude-X_: i don't' think it's hard to pick out the elements that are interactable
[17:11:43] Dude-X_: but sometimes to have stable tests, you need to know what's the right thing to wait on
[17:12:02] sixpindin: USing the agility pack (which is fantastic for parsing HTML) - I just get source, parse, create elements, and if a user tries to interact with something that's not visible, then I can refresh my page class and try again
[17:12:03] Dude-X_: that may sometimes be another unrelated element
[17:12:20] Dude-X_: what does refreshing the page class entail
[17:12:55] sixpindin: (1) get source from webdriver (2) parse with html-agility-pack, creating a repository of custom elements (classes I built)
[17:13:26] sixpindin: It also gives them nicknames based on assosiations between labels and elements (the for attibute right now) 
[17:13:28] Dude-X_: these elements are just locators right
[17:14:12] sixpindin: but I want to write a class that does the nickanming based on gui locations of labels and elements (nearest label- although athat's a gross oversimplification)
[17:14:18] sixpindin: No
[17:14:22] sixpindin: The elements are not locators
[17:14:38] Dude-X_: you re-find the elements?
[17:14:49] sixpindin: They are fully formed representations of the elemetns on the page, names, infomation about the element, etc, the locator is one of these properties (xpath)
[17:15:03] Dude-X_: so you get new WebElements?
[17:15:09] sixpindin: Did I understand your question right? - 
[17:15:11] sixpindin: Noppe
[17:15:16] Dude-X_: okay good
[17:15:19] sixpindin: I never get the selenium lements
[17:15:26] sixpindin: until a user tries to interact with one
[17:15:40] sixpindin: then I use the xpath property of my custom element to find that using webdriver
[17:15:56] Dude-X_: ok that's sensible
[17:15:57] sixpindin: webdriver interaction is minimal, but I get loads of information about the page. I
[17:16:40] sixpindin: Thanks...Although I'm just stuck on the page thing now. It's turning into a bit of a monster and I'm finding cracks in the design now. 
[17:16:48] sixpindin: It's just the concept of a page
[17:16:54] sixpindin: in OOP
[17:17:21] sixpindin: I can't think of the best way to create it and wondered if anybody else has done anything like this. 
[17:17:34] sixpindin: Although I've already got a working class, I want to redo it.
[17:17:54] Dude-X_: like i said, i've heard about auto generated page objects but no one has shared their framework
[17:18:04] Dude-X_: i'm thinking it's just a custom built solution based on their applicaton
[17:18:12] sixpindin: Currently is uses URL, but that's not good enough as the same URL can give you many states, which may as well be differnt pages
[17:18:17] sixpindin: I'd be more than happy to share mine
[17:18:22] Dude-X_: i create my page objects by hand
[17:18:27] sixpindin: I used to do that
[17:18:43] Dude-X_: fire up firefox, firebug w fire path, figure out locators in CSS
[17:18:55] Dude-X_: then write the functions. 
[17:19:01] Dude-X_: then write the test, and tweak
[17:19:09] Dude-X_: to add good web driver waits
[17:19:17] sixpindin: But found them hard to maintain. You can point this framework at a website that it's never seen before and it just works (sometimes)
[17:19:45] sixpindin: Ah, you'd love this then.
[17:19:47] Dude-X_: well the sometimes part is the hard thing
[17:19:55] sixpindin: But!
[17:20:11] Dude-X_: it's really the web driver waits that are the most crucial part to figure out
[17:20:31] Dude-X_: where i work the most annoying part is that a test can pass locally but fail on the build server
[17:20:52] Dude-X_: (probably because it's slow as shit and it uses CentOS which is not what I have on my desktop)
[17:22:02] sixpindin: It's not finished. It uses various strategies for giving the elements suitable nicknames. It only uses one strategy right now, and that's pretty basic. When I write more strategies then it'll get better. There's also a way to override the default name that gets assigned, and it falls back on the ID if not found - It's really a work in progress.
[17:22:09] sixpindin: Ah, what do you run locally?
[17:22:27] Dude-X_: ubuntu precise pangolin
[17:22:28] sixpindin: We've not got ours working on the build server yet. I'm to distracted by this framework..it's dire.
[17:22:40] sixpindin: Nice. I could learn alot from you then!
[17:23:02] Dude-X_: i think i'd get reprimanded if i worked on a framework to automatically create page objects at work :p
[17:23:36] sixpindin: Why? - are they not into trying new things? - You can have mine. 
[17:23:46] Siph0n| has joined #selenium
[17:23:50] Dude-X_: but my project is in java
[17:24:09] Dude-X_: i know java on some level but i don't know much about the infrastructure to maintain a java codebase
[17:24:12] sixpindin: Although, again, it's not finished. One of the guys even wrote a BDD-builder tool that uses the framework to build the gherkin in a point-click browser thing. 
[17:24:38] Dude-X_: one thing i saw at a selenium meet up is a front end program to create page objects
[17:24:50] Dude-X_: so it's like a catalog of page objects and tests
[17:24:50] sixpindin: I'd love to see that!
[17:25:13] Dude-X_: seems pretty neat, except the actual code (in java) looks overly nested and hard to trace :/
[17:25:14] sixpindin: Sounds similar, although it's likily to be far better. Is it online?
[17:25:30] Dude-X_: i'll see if I can the link to the presentation at least
[17:25:42] Dude-X_: well it doesn't automatically parse pages
[17:25:58] Dude-X_: you just have to the work upfront to name all the pageobjects
[17:26:03] Dude-X_: err elements
[17:26:05] sixpindin: Dam. I may have veered WAY off then :( 
[17:26:24] Dude-X_: i think what you're doing is good
[17:26:34] Dude-X_: but it's harder because you're making a super general tool
[17:26:42] Dude-X_: most people do things that suit their project
[17:27:07] sixpindin: The parsing was the crown of what I was doing - LOL@general - tell me about it, my programmer frend says I'm trying to build "The generic thing machine"
[17:27:30] sixpindin: The idea is that I can transport it around the business across many differnt projects
[17:28:06] Dude-X_: that really is too ambitious
[17:28:15] sixpindin: I wanted to get it to the point where I could compile it and create a tool that people could just use and you could swap out differnt web-drivers
[17:28:22] Dude-X_: never the less
[17:28:32] sixpindin: I'm a dreamer.
[17:28:50] Dude-X_: put it up on github (or your favorite repo site) and make some noise about it
[17:30:17] sixpindin: I'd love to do that, I really would, because I'm so keen to understand the best practises. I've been racking my head with design patterns, implimented the ones' I think suit best, but I need advice from people with more experience so that I can sleep at night. For example, the 
[17:30:21] sixpindin: page class thing
[17:31:51] sixpindin: The really cool thing about the autoparsing is that testers and developers can write tests using specflow. It helps remove the dependency on developers. Although, unlike QTP,etc, developers still get involved because it's all done write in the IDE (Visual studio in our case) and specflow compiles unit-tests from the gherkin.
[17:32:40] sixpindin: I just have no idea where all this sits in the grand scheme of things. I'm pretty new to automation and programming (six months now) but this is why I'm here on IRC!
[17:35:15] sixpindin: Your github idea is great. I was just afraid of uploading it too soon and people thinking its trash and not wanting to help out. Are there developers that pass thorough here who might take an email from me describing the architecture and offer advice?
[17:35:57] Dude-X_: there's the selenium-users google group's list
[17:36:25] Dude-X_: the core developers are here during the weekday
[17:36:40] sixpindin: They pointed me here. Although that was for getting involved in the actual selenium project coding (coding is turning out to be so fun) - 
[17:36:46] sixpindin: Ah, weekday then.
[17:36:55] sixpindin: Where are you based yourself, if you don't mind me asking
[17:37:02] Dude-X_: i am in NYC
[17:37:04] sixpindin: I'm in Wales right now.
[17:37:21] sixpindin: Dam. That's not local at all.
[17:37:30] Dude-X_: most of the core devs are in or around London
[17:38:20] sixpindin: That 'is' local. - cool. Not that I'll be knocking anybodies door, just wanted to get an idea.
[17:38:57] Dude-X_: i started working at my current job in Oct 2010
[17:39:02] Dude-X_: never heard of webdriver
[17:39:21] sixpindin: I'm going to shoot off here. I think I need to really structure my question better - sorry for the mind vomit - although thanks for the advice and encouragement
[17:39:28] sixpindin: Ah
[17:39:42] Dude-X_: now i have a pretty good idea on how to beat it into submission :p
[17:39:45] sixpindin: Did you have programming experience?
[17:40:12] Dude-X_: Yes, but I have more of a Python and C++ background
[17:40:28] Dude-X_: so when i joined this company
[17:40:28] Dude-X_: the project was in Java
[17:40:49] Dude-X_: so i had to learn Java AND Webdriver
[17:40:51] sixpindin: Yea, and I seen the whole W3C standards thing, that was really pleasing, as it means all our expereince with webdriver is more valuable; I think. 
[17:40:54] Dude-X_: as well as Git
[17:41:01] Dude-X_: oh yeah
[17:41:10] Siph0n has joined #selenium
[17:41:11] Dude-X_: i get lots of recruiters sending me emails, or even calling me
[17:42:31] NeptuNooo: how can i export the selenium webdriver repository to folders and save it on my disc
[17:42:56] NeptuNooo: because otherwise i can't build diagrams which are v useful when exploring code
[17:42:57] sixpindin: My friend raves about Git - I trust him so I'm going to get involved with that too. With recruiters though, I'm really loyal and as long as I'm getting paid enough to live then it's all about doing interesting work for me. Still, the standards thing means we might see new drivers comming out that we can just swap in and out of our test frameworks.
[17:43:28] sixpindin: - dude-x: It's been an absolute pleasure, hope to catch you on here again.
[17:43:30] Dude-X_: NeptuNooo, you can svn up the googlecodebase, or git clone the github copy of the repo
[17:43:40] Dude-X_: sixpindin, o/ take acre
