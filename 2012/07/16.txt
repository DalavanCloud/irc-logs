[11:43:32] random_: After opening a pdf file in the firefox browser, is it possible to find an exact text string? Just tell me where i can find the info..tried to google it
[11:43:35] AutomatedTester: andreastt: how is getLogs implemented in OperaDriver?
[11:44:03] AutomatedTester: random_: Firefox can't access the plugin so you need something else
[11:44:04] andreastt: AutomatedTester: It's not yet (currently just throws UnsupportedOperationException), but I was working on an implementation before I went on vacation.
[11:44:39] random_: something else as in?
[11:45:05] AutomatedTester: andreastt: Once of the b2g people needs a way to clear logs and I wonder if getLogs should be incremental from the last time it was called
[11:45:22] AutomatedTester: random_: not sure
[11:46:13] random_: ok! Atleast i know it cant access it.. Thanks!
[11:46:26] AutomatedTester: random_: you *might* be able to do it with a newer version of Firefox and have pdf.js enable
[11:46:41] random_: will try it out!
[11:47:06] AutomatedTester: random_: pdf.js is shipped with Firefox so its just a case of making sure that it is allowed
[11:47:15] andreastt: AutomatedTester: I also have some issues about the interfaces currently in place, I foresee it potentially storing some enormous data structures.
[11:47:35] AutomatedTester: andreastt: same, and that is why I say lets clear it
[11:47:46] andreastt: That might be an option.
[11:48:28] AutomatedTester: so when I call getLogs() it returns them and clears the current log
[11:49:00] andreastt: I also want it to take more of an opt-in approach: If you ask for logs from, say JS, it shouldn't have to keep a storage of the other logs unless needed.  But I guess that's an implementation detail.
[11:49:44] andreastt: If we clear on retrieval, the API call LogEntries.getAll() is misleading IMO.
[11:50:48] AutomatedTester: andreastt: where is the current interface
[11:51:23] andreastt: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/logging/Logs.html
[11:51:31] andreastt: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/logging/LogEntries.html
[11:52:49] AutomatedTester: hmmm ok, I am going to ignore that for now
[11:53:06] *AutomatedTester climbs his high-horse and rides off into the distance
[11:53:33] andreastt: A callback into your local program would be nice. \-:
[11:53:51] AutomatedTester: a call back to the AUT?
[11:54:04] AutomatedTester: or to the browser?
[11:54:46] andreastt: AUT
[11:55:45] AutomatedTester: hmm not sure about that one
[11:56:08] AutomatedTester: but what I am imagining is probably different to what you are thinking ;)

[14:23:46] toehio_: Is the only difference between execute and executeAsync that executeAsync calls a callback when it's done, instead of just "returning"? If this is the case, is it actually asynchronous since the method only returns when the callback is called?
[14:24:36] simonstewart: The method returns when the callback is called, but the callback is called asynchronously by the executing JS

[16:21:42] NeptuNooo: IEdriver hovers over dropdownmenu (sometimes) then the dropdown appears for half a second and disappears, and therefore webdriver refuses to click on an element from dropdown menu
[16:22:18] barancev: will 2.25 support FF14?

[16:24:25] Dude-X: it would be a good idea to delay to 2.25 to include support for FF14
[16:25:22] NeptuNooo: and if your automation-test for hovering over elements are succesful, then tell me

[19:17:47] sylus: Hey does anyone know how to run selenium so that the resultFile isn't needed, I needed the output to appear on stdout so travis can detect if there is an error. Currently my line looks like: java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.15.0.jar -htmlSuite "*firefox" "http://localhost:8080" "test/selenium/Login.html" "test/selenium/Result.html"

[20:20:37] pindonga: any ideas why selenium might be doing this?
[20:20:44] pindonga: this doesn't happen if I replace noscript with div

[21:31:51] AutomatedTester: or driver.switch_to_window(..)
[21:31:59] whomp: what about in the GUI?
[21:32:24] AutomatedTester: what?
[21:32:34] whomp: the selenium gui for firefox
[21:32:44] AutomatedTester: the IDE?
[21:32:51] whomp: yeah the IDE
[21:33:57] AutomatedTester: selectWindow
[21:34:23] whomp: and then i can use a selector like Title=? ?
[21:34:54] AutomatedTester: whomp: have a look at the help at the bottom of the IDE
[21:35:06] AutomatedTester: click the reference button and it will show you what to do

[21:49:13] whomp: ahh we got it
[21:49:14] whomp: thanks
[21:53:38] whomp: are there any plans underway for more keyboard shortcuts in the IDE? shortcuts for things like running a test and deleting a command would be immensely helpful
[21:59:59] AutomatedTester: whomp: maybe... the focus really is on Selenium WebDriver

[23:22:32] whomp: i want to call a test case within another test case in the selenium IDE. is this possible?
[23:25:18] AutomatedTester: whomp: no
[23:26:02] whomp: you realize, right, that the ide is a thousand times faster and easier to use than code-based tests?
[23:27:04] barancev: whomp: no, again :)
[23:27:34] barancev: in particular because there is no way to call a test case within another test case :)
[23:28:03] whomp: haha imagine if it could do it...
[23:28:11] AutomatedTester: whomp:  Its really _bad_ practises for tests to know about each other 
[23:28:23] barancev: it would become programming
[23:28:26] AutomatedTester: I cant even describe how much of a bad idea that is
[23:28:29] whomp: as opposed to copy-pasting?

[23:29:49] barancev: Reusable And Extensible Test Architecture is a key to not die under the weight of the tests
[23:30:43] whomp: that's a massive document
[23:31:08] whomp: it just has to function as something of an alias
[23:31:17] whomp: like an inline function
[23:32:03] barancev: with global scope of all the variables? hmm... road to the hell
[23:32:13] AutomatedTester: whomp: do you have a use and throw away policy?
[23:32:49] whomp: you could just add namespaces
[23:33:00] whomp: or add your own ones? that's how c libs work
[23:33:11] whomp: AutomatedTester, i'm not sure what you're talking about
[23:33:39] AutomatedTester: whomp: you said that IDE is so much faster, do you just use the test you create and then throw it away?
[23:33:47] AutomatedTester: if something changes
[23:34:09] whomp: no, we export them to php and add in anything else we need. then we store them for whenever we regression test
[23:34:30] AutomatedTester: so you maintain the PHP stuff?
[23:34:49] AutomatedTester: and... if you export why do you need to call things between tests in the IDE?
[23:35:15] barancev: namespaces, parameters passing, and soon it becomes... surprise! a programming language!
[23:35:52] bmulholland has joined #selenium
[23:47:03] whomp: AutomatedTester, one of the benefits of the IDE is debugging. when it fails, we can see exactly why (e.g., it redirected us to a sign in page because we forgot to log in)
[23:47:31] AutomatedTester: whomp: I have that with my code, and it takes screenshots
[23:47:39] whomp: barancev, you can already pass parameters...
[23:48:31] AutomatedTester: whomp: I see what the issue is by looking at my report on my jenkins and the screenshots it has ready
[23:48:56] whomp: yeah, but if you're working in a huge group of enterprise sites, with lots of different things to worry about, graphical debugging and changes are so helpful. adding in a selector, for example, is much faster in the IDE should we see a bug
[23:49:41] AutomatedTester: whomp: tbh, my locators tend to be more stable than the ones that IDE make
[23:51:00] whomp: the issue isn't reliability (it's good enough for us), the issue is speed
[23:51:42] whomp: i mean, coding is good. it has lots of benefits. but it has its pros and cons against the ide. its not like one auto-trumps the other
[23:53:18] AutomatedTester: we invested in developing a good DSL for our tests
[23:53:32] AutomatedTester: so we develop our code as quickly as we can record
