[17:25:40] ner0x: How can I look up an element with the name "NAMEHERE", without knowing it's actual element type.
[17:32:08] Dude-X_: what's the attribute that has NAMEHERE
[17:33:09] ner0x: @name
[17:33:12] ner0x: I figured it out though
[17:33:18] ner0x:  //*[@name="NAMEHERE"] 
[17:34:29] andreastt: By.css("*[name='NAMEHERE']") in CSS, preusmably.
[17:37:11] Dude-X_: you can also use findElement(By.name()
[17:37:18] Dude-X_: or .find_element_by_name
[17:38:41] ner0x: Everyone switching to css?
[17:51:08] dmachi has joined #selenium
[IRC logfile - Started Sun Jul 22 18:08:58 2012]
[18:08:58] andreastt: ner0x: CSS selectors are generally more performance tuned in all browsers.
[18:09:17] andreastt: ner0x: That said, By is still using xpath selectors.
[18:28:15] sburjan has joined #selenium
[18:44:10] ner0x: Does it make "that" much of a difference?
[18:44:20] ner0x: Already 1000+ lines deep. :-/
[18:44:30] andreastt: Yes.
[18:44:50] andreastt: See this: http://sauceio.com/index.php/2011/05/why-css-locators-are-the-way-to-go-vs-xpath/
[18:44:51] sburjan has joined #selenium
[18:46:16] ner0x: I wonder how that transfers to perl.
[18:46:52] andreastt: Perl?
[18:46:58] ner0x: Yes, perl.
[18:50:00] ner0x: It's doable. But add some extra typing.
[18:50:36] deam has joined #selenium
[18:53:02] deam: After an ajax file upload, it seems selenium lost track totally. Even driver.page_source appears to be empty. Any advice?
[18:59:21] ner0x: Where can I find the css way to search for elements?
[18:59:25] *ner0x has always used xpath
[18:59:40] Swadq has joined #selenium
[IRC logfile - Started Sun Jul 22 19:00:12 2012]
[19:00:12] deam: use find_element_by_class
[19:02:54] ner0x: Not in the perl bindings yet.
[19:03:28] deam: ah, not sure then.. I am using Python bindings

[19:07:39] ner0x: I think I'll just stick to xpath for now.
[19:07:45] ner0x: I typically only run one test at a time.
[19:11:19] deam: I guess that's just fine
[19:14:53] stockton has joined #selenium
[19:15:40] ner0x: And when I run a full suite it's towards the end of the work and time isn't really an issue.
[19:17:07] deam: god, this ajax issue annoys me

[22:52:33] Dude-X_: is it possible to make native events a live toggle-able setting?
[22:58:51] barancev: in theory, yes
[22:59:23] barancev: but Simon dislikes this idea for some reason :)

[23:22:30] Dude-X_: barancev, well, native events can be 50% to 100% times slower in Firefox. It would be nice to have a toggleable setting so that we can use it for special cases; For now we are thinking about creating a separate annotation for tests that need native events
[23:24:07] andreastt: Won't marionette solve a number of these issues?
