[00:44:03] AutomatedTester: klrmn: for the new FirefoxDriver?
[00:45:10] klrmn: yes
[00:46:24] AutomatedTester: no, Malini Das in my team is
[00:46:34] AutomatedTester: since she needed to get it sorted for B2G
[00:46:52] AutomatedTester: I am trying to stabilize for Desktop atm
[00:47:22] AutomatedTester: so far I am sorted things I need for OWA
[00:47:30] AutomatedTester: we pass more than half of the tests
[00:50:17] jarib: AutomatedTester: so it will replace the current FirefoxDriver? that's exciting 
[00:50:37] AutomatedTester: jarib: marionette === FirefoxDriver built into Firefox
[00:51:11] jarib: cool, i thought it was only for B2G
[00:51:22] jarib: i guess B2G == Firefox
[00:52:31] AutomatedTester: B2G is the first project to use it
[00:52:34] AutomatedTester: OWA is the 2nd
[00:52:42] AutomatedTester: OWA is the first desktop
[00:53:02] AutomatedTester: and then once I get the QA team going I get to hopefully get Fennec working with it
[00:53:26] AutomatedTester: hopefully by the end of the year it will be all there
[00:53:31] AutomatedTester: Mobile and Desktop
[00:58:06] jarib: still using a proxy to translate JSON wire calls to Marionette?
[00:58:17] AutomatedTester: jarib: for now
[00:58:32] AutomatedTester: internally I am using raw marionette
[00:59:01] AutomatedTester: but long term is update client code to speak marionette

[10:44:27] simonstewart: "yes" :)
[10:45:12] rp2: great, thanks!
[10:46:32] *AutomatedTester saw the most relevant tweet yesterday about how we are training new people to the industry/technology to apologize before asking for help
[10:46:48] AutomatedTester: "Sorry this is a noob question but ...."
[10:46:57] rp2: well, the reason I'm here is that I am looking into systematic web application testing. I thought: it'd be great if I could perform testing manually but record my actions and then repeat my tests later, even with different browsers, by playing back the recording 
[10:47:34] rp2: I've installed Selenium IDE and the IE and Firefox WebDrivers and managed to do something that approximates this
[10:47:36] simonstewart: rp2: take a look at Selenium IDE or SauceBuilder
[10:47:41] simonstewart: Right
[10:47:44] rp2: which is absolutely wonderful!
[10:48:07] rp2: but there are a couple of problems
[10:48:21] rp2: one problem is that Selenium IDE doesn't record every action
[10:48:22] AutomatedTester: :spec
[10:48:23] selbot2: http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html | http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/
[10:48:30] rp2: eg the back button or closing a tab
[10:49:48] rp2: so i'm wondering: where is this limitation? is it in the recording or inthe playback? can WebDriver play back such events and do I just need to find, or create, a more complete recorder?
[10:50:13] AutomatedTester: there are limitations in both
[10:50:21] rp2: ok ...
[10:51:12] rp2: if I only wanted to follow links I could use proxy-based recording and playback (JMeter, Fiddler or whatever)
[10:51:41] rp2: so i expected Selenium to cover a bit more of the user actions
[10:52:52] simonstewart: The IDE works by hooking into the JS events that are fired
[10:53:04] simonstewart: The back button doesn't fire something in a way that it can handle
[10:54:39] AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
[10:55:20] AutomatedTester: *sigh* you know when you thought you plugged the power
[10:55:23] AutomatedTester: but didnt
[10:58:38] simonstewart: It's one of the reasons why we advise people to move to the webdriver or rc ASAP
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Jul  6 11:05:11 2012]
[11:05:11] rp2: I understand ... but I haven't found a recorder for it yet
[11:05:23] simonstewart: "it"?
[11:05:45] rp2: that uses the same technique, I mean
[11:06:24] rp2: I suppose if a WebDriver can direct a broowser through automation, it can also be made to record what happens in the browser
[11:07:10] rp2: but I haven't studied browser automation upport at all, i don't know how complete such a recording can be
[11:07:16] rp2: sorry about the typos
[11:07:22] MattR has joined #selenium
[11:07:48] rp2: i was just looking at the WaRR paper, maybe it does this
[11:09:31] AutomatedTester: recording a web app is really really difficult since knowing what events to capture is hard
[11:09:37] AutomatedTester: and what it interacts with 
[11:12:51] rp2: I realize that
[11:13:21] AutomatedTester: rp2: in my experience, and I appreciate I am baised, is that record replay is actually record, tweak, replay
[11:13:24] rp2: another problem is in what terms to record what is captured
[11:14:18] rp2: I'm happy doing some tweaking but before I start I'm trying to get a feel for how much tweaking I have to prepare myself for
[11:14:37] AutomatedTester: well Selenium IDE won't record assertions
[11:14:56] AutomatedTester: so your test might "pass" but its not actually checked anything
[11:14:59] rp2: no
[11:15:31] rp2: I'm new to this but when I saw Selenium I thought of a way to improve on what it does
[11:16:54] rp2: if it recorded more context, like diff does for instance, it might become easier to modify the recordings to suit slight modifications in the applications themselves
[11:17:30] rp2: and of course it would help to record more events such as back and close window
[11:18:22] rp2: so i was wondering if anyone else has already done these things, they seem obvious
[11:19:01] barancev has joined #selenium
[11:19:09] lukea has joined #selenium
[11:19:37] AutomatedTester: rp2: there is a very fine balance between recording too much and too little
[11:20:09] rp2: yes, I can imagine ... and it's probably very application-specific
[11:20:37] AutomatedTester: rp2: if you create a patch that you think would add value then I am sure we can review
[11:21:01] AutomatedTester: but I don't think it will be a trivial thing to do 
[11:21:23] rp2: for now I won't have enough time to do anything like that ... but who knows
[11:22:14] rp2: I work at a university but not as a researcher, but if this is research-level I can probably find someone who is happy to do research on this
[11:22:26] rp2: and that will create the budget for such things
[11:22:59] rp2: hence my questions ...
[11:23:30] caddoo has joined #selenium
[11:23:32] mcaddoo has joined #selenium
[11:25:19] AutomatedTester: rp2: I think, from a research level, there are better investments to be done with WebDriver
[11:25:32] AutomatedTester: like building markov chains to drive automation
[11:25:36] AutomatedTester: and things like that
[11:26:24] rp2: ok
[11:26:26] AutomatedTester: layout testing, building on Michael Tamms work, with WebDriver
[11:26:55] rp2: i haven't scanned existing research yet, but if this WaRR paper is representative I can think of other things in that line
[11:27:01] AutomatedTester: WaRR?
[11:27:16] rp2: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5958253
[11:27:47] rp2: http://code.google.com/p/warr/source/browse/README
[11:27:56] rp2: they modified WebKit to to the recording ...
[11:28:40] freynaud: it included selenium version  = "2.0b3" :p
[11:28:58] rp2: that seems like a hack to me. eventually you'd want a platform independent way to record with more fidelity
[11:29:53] freynaud: I wouldn't want that for my team, record and replay doesn't scale properly.
[11:30:21] rp2: another idea is to go the other way and study web app design guidelines to make web apps testable with Selenum
[11:30:41] freynaud: it's nice to get a feel of ho it works, but at some point you have to get away from record to test big apps
[11:30:43] rp2: that's one way to operationalize the advantages of REST
[11:30:48] rp2: sorry i'm rambling
[11:31:42] AutomatedTester: that seems similar to SeleniumBuilder
[11:32:45] AutomatedTester: argg. not that
[11:33:18] AutomatedTester: SeBuilder
[11:33:27] rp2: freynaud: doesn't that depend on what you want to do with it? completely automated testing by record and replay seems infeasible in general but that doesn't make it useless 
[11:34:15] AutomatedTester: freynaud: if you are in a actively developed app the maintenance cost of record/replay grows exponentially
[11:34:22] AutomatedTester: sorry rp2^
[11:35:40] rp2: i'm sure it does with the present level of recording and without any  restrictions on how the app is built
[11:35:51] rp2: but improvements can be made from both ends
[11:36:29] AutomatedTester: rp2: possibly but I would need to see how 
[11:37:11] rp2: and you can build tools that assist the tester eg a tool that highlights UI elemnets the ongoing tests haven't covered yet
[11:37:37] caddoo has joined #selenium
[11:37:53] rp2: well ... on the recording end: more context. e.g. record not just the link achor but also the link url and the page on which the link was clicked
[11:38:05] AutomatedTester: rp2: I am working on that atm
[11:38:12] AutomatedTester: but that is not a browser automation issue
[11:38:13] rp2: on the bulding end: principles such as URL stability
[11:38:36] AutomatedTester: rp2: URL stability is a rare thing
[11:38:42] AutomatedTester: unless it is a profile of a user
[11:39:18] rp2: but that is partly because web application designers don't set it as a goal
[11:39:38] AutomatedTester: rp2: what ever you do needs to work with the current web applications
[11:40:17] rp2: well ... there are several thngs
[11:40:42] rp2: several possible directions
[11:41:31] rp2: if Selenium becomes more useable with a wiki section that details How to make your Web App Selenium Testable, why not write that section? 
[11:43:29] AutomatedTester: rp2: we arent big enough yet to dictate that but like I said if you want to write that I am happy to review and push up for you :)
[11:44:00] rp2: if I have time I will try to think about it. seems more useful as a group effort

[11:50:10] AutomatedTester: it wasnt so much an issue in webdriver but in its use
[11:50:22] AutomatedTester: so now I tell them when they are being silly
[11:50:31] jimevans: so you needed to do some parameter validation at the language binding level.
[11:50:38] AutomatedTester: yea
[11:51:11] AutomatedTester: which, from documentation, should have been obvious but now an exception being thrown will be more obvious
[11:51:12] jimevans: y'know, you don't have that kind of problem in a statically typed language :P
[11:51:43] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I shouldnt have made them kwargs
[11:52:00] AutomatedTester: then it would have complained args were passed in
[11:52:02] jimevans: heh.

[12:03:50] jimevans: just because they're hosted on googlecode doesn't mean they're sponsored by google, but i digress.
[12:04:56] jimevans: i'm sorry, but i don't know what the syntax is for those particular php bindings to instantiate a new driver instance. i assume you're running the java server somewhere, right?
[12:05:34] softmanpetro: yes I start java -jar selenium-standalone.jar jimevans
[12:05:50] softmanpetro: is it not correct doing so ?
[12:06:00] jimevans: no, that's fine.

[12:10:24] itatitat: yes, the results...I cant analize the results in the browser
[12:10:52] simonstewart: biab
[12:11:00] jimevans: softmanpetro: so let me see if i understand
[12:11:19] softmanpetro: yes
[12:11:46] jimevans: you have a collection of buttons. when you click on any one of those buttons, you either refresh the page or navigate to a new url. you want to loop through the list of buttons, clicking each in turn?
[12:11:51] itatitat: If this looks like a Selenium bug, make sure to read http://seleniumhq.org/docs/02_selenium_ide.html
[12:12:01] softmanpetro: yes jimevans
[12:12:01] itatitat: I dont know...im surprised
[12:12:13] jimevans: softmanpetro: i can't see how that would work.
[12:12:43] jimevans: the moment you navigate by clicking on the first button, the reference to every other button in your collection of button references is invalid.
[12:13:21] jimevans: so the first one should work, then every subsequent one would give you a StaleElementReferenceException (or the equivalent in your language bindings)
[12:14:48] softmanpetro: I have a: foreach {webdriver->geturl; function} and inside function {select button and later button->click; maybe here I should return with javascript the url where I warrive with executrescript and than $webdriver->geturl(fromwhatreturns)} than test element and return to initial foreach
[12:15:04] AutomatedTester: itatitat: that sounds like a phpunit issue
[12:15:26] itatitat: I dont know.....really I was trying the week phpunit without problems, but just now....
[12:15:35] itatitat: ok, I'll follo trying...
[12:17:04] jimevans: softmanpetro: that's up to you. i'm having difficulty seeing what you're trying to achieve. i don't know php, and i'm sure my ignorance is getting in the way.
[12:17:21] AutomatedTester: davehunt: somehow got disconnected from my people account
[12:17:38] softmanpetro: thank you for talking ... I will try a bit more
[12:20:30] random has joined #selenium
[12:22:35] random: how can i use findelement to find  this.program = "css=img[alt=\"" + program + "\"]"; I tried using  driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(program)); , but get exception error
[12:22:38] softmanpetro: $script="somefunc();return document.location;"; echo $webdriver->executeScript($script, array()); should I see the url location opened by the execution of that somefunc   ?
[12:23:11] itatitat: AutomatedTester: this is my error msg: Selenium selectWindow failing
[12:24:02] softmanpetro: I get Catchable fatal error: Object of class stdClass could not be converted to string i
[12:25:36] jimevans: random: omit the "css=" from your locator. in other words, try this.program="img[alt='" + program + "']";
[12:29:44] random: jimevans: i get NoSuchElementException: Unable to locate element: {"method":"tag name","selector":"img[alt='xxxxxxxxxx']"}, when it clearly says on selenium ide target = css=img[alt="xxxxxxxxxxxx"]
[12:30:01] softmanpetro: $script="somefunc();"; echo $webdriver->executeScript($script, array()); echo $webdriver->getCurrentUrl(); die; and it looks that die is executed before the script is finished so I cannot get the redirect produced by that function ! any hint ?
[12:31:05] jimevans: random: how would you locate the element using css selectors using javascript alone?
[12:32:52] random: jimevans:  idk? i thought that would work since this.logo = "css=img[title=\"" + logo + "\"]"; worked fine
[12:33:49] jimevans: random: it sounds like you're using a mixture of Selenium IDE and WebDriver.
[12:34:03] jimevans: are you trying to use WebDriverBackedSelenium?
[12:34:59] jimevans: you see, here's the thing: locators between Selenium IDE and WebDriver are different. you can't just copy from one to the other and expect it to work.
[12:35:28] jimevans: the "css=" prefix is a Selenium IDE/RC thing only. WebDriver doesn't know how to handle that.
[12:36:21] random: yeah, im using selenium and webdriver connected to fitnesse.. Yes im using WebDriverBackedSelenium.. And yeah, i just noticed i used selenium.click on the first one
[12:36:26] random: and using driver on the other one
[12:36:56] random: is there any way of doing it in webdriver?
[12:37:18] jimevans: of course. and you're on the right track.
[12:37:27] jimevans: but the locator is where the issue is.
[12:38:52] jimevans: the best way i know of to debug something like this is to load the page up manually in the browser, and go into a javascript console (firebug for firefox, the f12 developer tools for IE, or similar), and try document.querySelector("your-css-selector-here")
[12:39:09] jimevans: if you get an element returned, then your selector will work with webdriver; if you don't, it won't.
[12:40:01] random: ok, thanks for your help!
[12:40:01] softmanpetro: can anyone please tell me how to add a callback to wait for $webdriver->executeAsyncScript($script.. to be executed ?
[12:40:20] softmanpetro: any simple known example with that ?
[12:40:20] AutomatedTester: I found where my other spelling mistake came from in the python code
[12:40:29] AutomatedTester: that will teach me for porting code directly

[14:19:13] llaskin: i don't get your question softmanpetro
[14:19:29] softmanpetro: jimevans can you give me some hints on how to return the url after a button click please ?
[14:21:18] jimevans: softmanpetro: i think you're probably approaching this in entirely the wrong way, but i'm not sure what you mean by this question. do you mean "How can i determine what URL clicking this button will navigate to?" or something else?
[14:21:51] AutomatedTester: oh dear, chrome just crashed 
[14:21:58] AutomatedTester: on the alerts tests
[14:22:02] softmanpetro: jimevans yes
[14:22:20] softmanpetro: I want to find the url clicking this button will navigate to
[14:22:25] AutomatedTester: googlers ^
[14:22:44] softmanpetro: in order to webdrive->getUrl(urlabove^)
[14:23:16] softmanpetro: than to check if some text previously taken from the previous url is present to the new url 
[14:23:51] jimevans: softmanpetro: you'll need to analyze the attributes of the element then. that's the only way you'd be able to do it without actually clicking on the button first.
[14:24:48] softmanpetro: I do not mind to click the button first but not sure how to wait for new page to fully load in order to get the element I am looking for

[14:47:45] jimevans: simonstewart: is anyone looking at removing the .dll version of the IE native code from the java bindings completely anytime soon? i thought i remember you saying that 2.25 will be the java release when that should happen for good.
[14:48:34] jimevans: i ask because when that's done, we can remove the .dlls from the prebuilts directory, and can only update the .exes then.
[14:50:47] simonstewart: jimevans: I'm working on a selenium update in the office
[14:50:53] simonstewart: Once that's in, I'm deleting those things
[14:51:17] jimevans: cool. i was just curious. 2.25 early next week, then?
[14:51:24] simonstewart: Yeah.

[14:58:44] Parabola: its annoying enough to have to do it for chrome :) its the reason I'm still running 2.21

[15:00:23] llaskin: i tend to agree with P'

[15:01:24] simonstewart: krosenvold: ping
[15:01:27] AutomatedTester: dawagner: I cant seem to get anything meaningful out of chromedriver
[15:02:17] nirvdrum: Parabola: Yeah, it's a bit tedious having to fetch from N different locations.  I think Mercury or something like that rolls up a single bundle for you.  Might be worth looking into.
[15:02:48] Parabola: Mercury, never heard of it
[15:03:08] jimevans: my proposal. ability to edit session capabilities at runtime. wire protocol addition. POST /session/:sessionid/capability. body parameters are a capability name (string) and a capability value (string | number | boolean | object). either returns a boolean (yes or no, the capability was set) or the full capabilities of the session after the attempt to edit, i haven't decided yet.
[15:03:09] Parabola: if my nodes were all linux it would be much easier for me to manage, but i'm not a windows guy, i'm not sure how i would easily automate the updating of the nodes
[15:03:26] Parabola: jimevans: may I ask why?
[15:03:40] simonstewart: jimevans: you mean "it should be possible to change the config of a running driver instance"?
[15:03:43] jimevans: exposed in the language bindings as a setCapability() method on the WebDriver.Options interface
[15:04:05] jimevans: simonstewart: exactly. let you do things like turn native events on/off, change logging levels, and so on.
[15:04:19] Parabola: sounds neat, but not something I'd personally utilize
[15:04:32] simonstewart: Have you had users ask for that?
[15:04:35] Parabola: I create the driver I need for the test/action I need
[15:05:13] dawagner: barancev was asking about that too
[15:05:31] jimevans: simonstewart: i've wanted it myself. native events was the first driver for me thinking of it, wanting to use native events most of the time, but being able to turn it off for very specific steps.
[15:05:34] simonstewart: The user cases of our users seldom need it
[15:05:47] simonstewart: jimevans: I tend to think of the opposite
[15:05:56] simonstewart: native events always on, and simulate in JS when necesssary
[15:05:58] jimevans: logging in the IE driver made me revisit it, wanting to increase the logging level for just the problematic issues.
[15:06:07] simonstewart: At that point, we can use the atoms directly
[15:06:27] simonstewart: jimevans: the logging API should allow us to grab logs of a specific type and level
[15:06:31] jimevans: simonstewart: I think that's what i said, right? use native events most of the time, but turn off for specific stuff?
[15:06:41] jimevans: ah, right.
[15:06:46] simonstewart: (though it'd be grossly ineffecient to turn that on all the time)
[15:06:47] dawagner: A user would need to know a lot about our internals to use the click atom directly if native events were enabled

[15:07:48] Parabola: that is all.
[15:07:53] simonstewart: Parabola: ?
[15:07:59] jimevans: simonstewart: you'd have to make the keyboard and mouse implementations switchable at runtime, which they're not right now, i don't think.
[15:08:01] Parabola: you're far more useful than I :P
[15:08:20] simonstewart: I'm not so sure
[15:08:29] simonstewart: Generally people want to use the synthesized events for a click
[15:08:33] simonstewart: They don't care about other things
[15:08:48] simonstewart: So why not "new Actions(jsmouse).click(element)";
[15:09:01] jimevans: simonstewart: interesting thought.
[15:09:08] simonstewart: Mixing and matching through a complex workflow and hoping to preserve mouse state would be madness
[15:10:17] simonstewart: And that way we can get synthesized events everywhere
[15:11:32] *jimevans started down this road awhile back with synthetic events for IE, but abandoned it because his mouse/keyboard implementations weren't runtime settable.
[15:11:45] simonstewart: hmmm...
[15:12:03] simonstewart: My main concern is when people start wanting to set _all the variables_
[15:12:29] jimevans: i like your approach better.
[15:13:03] jimevans: there's no reason i couldn't have a .NET Actions class constructor overload that takes IKeyboard and IMouse args.
[15:13:19] simonstewart: It's one of the reasons mouse and keyboard are interfaces
[15:13:29] simonstewart: The original idea was to support drag and drop from the desktop

[15:34:55] dawagner: Each build node then calls out to SauceLabs to provide an actual browser

[15:35:58] simonstewart: using chattr to figure out why root can't change ownership of files in a git repo
[15:36:11] detronizator: dawagner: so, the different OS you need to build (well, I think of IE drivers for example), are provided by different jenkins boxes
[15:36:30] dawagner: Aah.  We cheat a bit there.
[15:36:47] detronizator: what do u mean?
[15:36:49] dawagner: We check in precompiled binaries for Windows, when we change things which are Windows-specific
[15:37:06] detronizator: so, those are manually compiled?

[15:37:28] jimevans: there. that should hopefully fix the *sigh* nuget dependency problems we've historically had.
[15:37:40] dawagner: In an ideal world we'd have a windows machine wired in which we could ask to do compiles of Windows stuff for us, and grab the build output from
[15:37:49] dawagner: I just haven't gotten around to setting that up yet
[15:38:03] jimevans: and with that, i'm off. have a good weekend.

[15:39:12] detronizator: dawagner: mmm, I see.
[15:39:17] simonstewart: Have a great weekend jimevans
[15:39:28] detronizator: dawagner: sounds all "reasonable" (except the window thing - but I understand the "difficulty")
[15:39:46] dawagner: Maybe I'll take some free time at some point to write a remote-VS-compiler interface... Sounds like it could be fun
[15:40:00] detronizator: dawagner: I guess the only thing I need to check is if there is a nice free quota on those Google VMs :)
[15:40:23] dawagner: heh
[15:40:49] dawagner: What does your build look like? And how many platforms do you have to run tests on?
[15:41:21] dawagner: If I get a remote windows compiler running, I'm sure it would have enough spare capacity to give you some :)
[15:41:35] detronizator: dawagner: PhantomJS. It needs to compile at least 3 statics: 1 for mac, 1 for linux, 1 for windows
[15:41:54] hourback has joined #selenium
[15:42:04] detronizator: and then run the tests we got (they take something like 2 seconds on my machine to run)
[15:42:31] dawagner: How big is your source?
[15:42:51] detronizator: 797M
[15:42:56] detronizator: just did a "du"
[15:43:12] detronizator: we host Qt inside our source, so we "tweak" it for our needs
[15:43:43] detronizator: and the source is hosted on GitHub, so simonstewart will have a problem with that :P
[15:44:33] dawagner: Sounds like the easiest thing to do would be grab three VMs linked to one web frontend, run completely separate builds on each of them, and aggregate the information in the web frontend
[15:44:35] detronizator: actually no: "only" 216M
[15:44:41] detronizator: 800M is after compile
[15:45:02] dawagner: And for mac, that means hiring or buying a mac mini, alas
[15:47:05] detronizator: it sounds like I should set up a small build farm under my desk
[15:47:24] detronizator: no free quota anywhere I see
[15:47:27] dawagner: Pretty much
[15:47:45] dawagner: Amazon do free micro insances
[15:47:55] detronizator: jenkins is free at least
[15:47:56] detronizator: :)
[15:48:09] dawagner: The linux, you could probably do on travis...
[15:48:24] detronizator: I think we had issues with the compilation of qt there
[15:48:30] detronizator: qt takes quite some time to build
[15:48:39] dawagner: aha
[15:48:39] detronizator: even our "stripped down" version
[15:48:52] dawagner: How often do you actually change qt?

[17:03:27] ian_mac_: adamgoucher: you still using RC? Or have you moved to webdriver?
[17:04:27] adamgoucher:  /i/ have moved to webdriver. still have some clients on rc though
[17:04:52] lukeis has joined #selenium
[17:06:57] simonstewart: Are you migrating them to the webdriver-backed selenium, and from there to webdriver?
[17:09:44] adamgoucher: there to webdriver
[17:09:51] simonstewart: k
[17:09:55] simonstewart: Any hiccups?
[17:10:14] adamgoucher: and less of a migration and more of a 'stop fixing rc scripts and just re-write them when they break in webdriver'
[17:10:29] simonstewart: Right. That's the approach we're using
[17:10:48] simonstewart: Use the new APIs when we touch classes using the old one
[17:10:53] adamgoucher: not so far i don't think. but theyve been doing rc-based page objects so its pretty simple
[17:11:18] simonstewart: But are you now using found elements efficiently?
[17:11:22] simonstewart: I often see things like
[17:11:22] adamgoucher: the /big/ leap i think is non-page-objects -> page object. swapping the api from underneath is easy-peasy
[17:11:30] simonstewart: rc.isDisplayed(locator)
[17:11:37] simonstewart: rc.click(locator)
[17:11:50] simonstewart: Which would do two look ups
[17:12:04] simonstewart: (actually, it boils down to  waaaay more webdriver code when emulating the rc api)
[17:12:40] adamgoucher: i have a wait_for_available(which is present and displayed) and a find_element_by_locator() in my frameworks which buries some of the pain
[17:13:03] simonstewart: I take it that's PHP right now?
[17:13:13] adamgoucher: and in python
[17:13:16] simonstewart: k
[17:13:44] adamgoucher: by the time it hits a client there are a couple layers of abstraction happening
[17:13:57] simonstewart: Got to love abstraction
[17:15:16] adamgoucher: can be a bit of a bear to explain to new clients though. well, you see. the thing you /think/ is the driver is actually your custom abstraction of my frameworks abstration of the actual driver

[18:41:54] adamgoucher: is the page available to the outside internets?
[18:42:14] TheOneTrueDevo: no

[18:43:32] TheOneTrueDevo: the only thing i can think of is that its and issue because its a modal loaded by js/ajax
[18:43:34] diminoten: then how is it getting past the wait?
[18:43:52] diminoten: maybe you could wait for the exact element you want to use to become available

[18:44:20] diminoten: btw selenium in php looks ugly
[18:44:22] diminoten: :P
[18:44:28] TheOneTrueDevo: and the error is when i try to put something in the form
[18:44:30] adamgoucher: could be perl :P
[18:44:41] TheOneTrueDevo: its php
[18:44:53] diminoten: not selenium's fault
[18:44:53] adamgoucher: i know, i mean the ugliness.
[18:44:55] diminoten: anyway
[18:45:00] Zack: agree with diminoten
[18:45:41] diminoten: so the wait does time out?  but only occasionally?
[18:45:54] diminoten: do you have the ability to watch the browser?
[18:46:05] diminoten: see if maybe the element is actually hanging
[18:46:23] TheOneTrueDevo: no, they wait works, the element isnt available when i try to input data into the form
[18:46:37] diminoten: the error you just linked said "Element wait timed out after 45"
[18:46:41] diminoten: what's that from then?

[19:56:57] Zack: there isn't a mouseover function that you could use like .clickdown?
[19:56:59] lukeis: how does the web app know your text is highlighted?
[19:57:19] Arrnas: i assume that its javascript
[19:57:26] lukeis: there's mousemove then mousedown then mouse move again
[19:57:38] lukeis: you could try that with the ActionChains class in python
[19:58:00] Arrnas: i don't really want to bother that much just to get a clickable link 
[19:58:23] Arrnas: if i find the javascript that does the linking can i somehow run that with selenium?
[19:58:29] lukeis: have a sample page that we could look at?
[19:58:38] lukeis: driver.execute_script
[19:58:38] Arrnas: you need an account 
[19:58:45] AutomatedTester: Arrnas: use the ActionChains
[19:59:03] AutomatedTester: it simplifies that type of use case and does what a user does
[19:59:21] AutomatedTester: you can execute_script but if you want user interaction use action chains
[19:59:42] *lukeis has had bad luck with complicated javascript and doing something like he's describing with actions
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Jul  6 20:01:48 2012]
[20:01:48] Arrnas: its interesting actually, when u hit the button a popup form goes up, but the form is just <form> ....</form>
[20:01:54] Arrnas: no javascript in sight
[20:04:58] Arrnas: so if i use action chains then just hold down shift and hit the left arrow for a number of times?
[20:05:41] AutomatedTester: Arrnas: that should work
[20:06:11] Arrnas: key_down(key, element=None)
[20:06:33] Arrnas: what do i send for shift and left arror?
[20:06:37] Arrnas: arrow*
[20:08:33] Arrnas: found em
[20:09:19] Dude-X: Keys class has em
[20:09:54] lukeis: Arrnas:  i think you found it... but: action.key_down(Keys.SHIFT).send_keys(Keys.ARROW_LEFT).key_up(Keys.SHIFT).perform()
[20:10:45] Arrnas: then ones i found are SHIFT = uíue008í  
[20:10:49] lukeis: you could also probably do .send_keys(Keys.ARROW_LEFT * 10)   ~ or how many times you want to left arrow
[20:11:10] lukeis: from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
[20:11:47] Arrnas: thanks alot

[20:29:38] lukeis: what's that? close all the ones that "Need Clarification?"
[20:30:30] slex: AutomatedTester: thank you for applying patch. sorry for wrong diff format - will use sdn diff instead IDEA in next time.
[20:31:02] AutomatedTester: slex: also, can you make sure it doesnt have windows line endings
[20:31:16] AutomatedTester: but otherwise its great!
[20:31:43] AutomatedTester: lukeis: wanna see if I can get a bug squash week going again
[20:31:47] AutomatedTester: we havent had one in a while
[20:32:14] lukeis: would love to do that... now if my work would cooperate and let me do something like that :)
[20:32:41] slex: AutomatedTester: ok.
[20:32:42] AutomatedTester: lukeis: I can write you a note
[20:33:39] lukeis: i think I can justify a "PTOn" but i need sign-off from my manager and I have a backlog till september :-/
[20:34:22] slex: AutomatedTester: but i have bad news - i made error in patch. take a look at my comment to patch - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=17337 could you fix that ?
[20:34:26] lukeis: the week of and after Dreamforce I'm only going to do selenium stuff
[20:36:06] AutomatedTester: slex: ahh I see that, looks like you only check self.host
[20:37:38] slex: yes, i've found that only during reviewing. i tested with all options so it was hidden.
[20:38:15] Arrnas: both ActionChains(browser).key_down(u'ue008').send_keys(u'ue012').key_up(u'ue008').perform() and  ActionChains(browser).key_down(Keys.SHIFT).send_keys(Keys.ARROW_LEFT).key_up(Keys.SHIFT).perform()

[20:40:24] slex: AutomatedTester: great! thanks again.
[20:40:31] AutomatedTester: slex: no worries
[20:40:32] lukeis: Arrnas: and in the first key_down can you pass the element too? so... key_down(Keys.SHIFT, element)   where element = browser.find_element....

[20:41:46] Dude-X: why does release() require an element
[20:42:17] lukeis: it shouldn't really... 
[20:42:34] lukeis: but i think clickAndHold requires one
[20:43:17] Dude-X: i tried it the other day via python interpreter
[20:43:36] AutomatedTester: wtf do people try run IE in parallel on the same machine
[20:43:47] Dude-X: is it even possible?
[20:44:03] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: technically yes
[20:44:04] dmachi has joined #selenium
[20:44:22] AutomatedTester: at least in python, .net and ruby with the IEDriverServer
[20:44:38] Dude-X: i see. because windows makes it difficult to spawn a separate IE process
[20:44:44] Dude-X: or does it‚Ä¶ hmm
[20:44:53] AutomatedTester: no thats not the problem
[20:44:59] AutomatedTester: the problem is that is shares cache
[20:45:16] Dude-X: that makes sense
[20:45:21] Arrnas: with the element specified the cursor jumps twenty something characters to the left and still throws the error full stack trace : http://pastebin.com/pqgVXcR6
[20:45:29] AutomatedTester: there is no profile mechanism
[20:46:50] Arrnas: also heres how it looks now : ActionChains(browser).key_down(Keys.SHIFT,elem).send_keys(Keys.ARROW_LEFT).key_up(Keys.SHIFT).perform()
[20:47:06] Arrnas: where elem = browser.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id="form_container"]/div[2]/form/div[2]/div')
[20:48:57] lukeis: try passing in elem to key_up too
[20:49:46] AutomatedTester: ahhh that is better
[20:58:34] Arrnas: looks like it crashes on .perform() even ActionChains(browser).key_down(Keys.SHIFT,elem).perform() crashes

[21:06:30] lukeis: throws the exception i would bet and expect ;)
[21:06:44] Arrnas: i think im on the wrong api,'ActionChains' object has no attribute 'perfrom' 
[21:06:53] Arrnas: oshit
[21:06:54] Arrnas: perfrom
[21:06:56] lukeis: Arrnas: what browser (and version), selenium version and platform are you on
[21:07:09] lukeis: perform* ;)
[21:08:48] Arrnas: im on windows 7 x64 i think 
[21:08:49] Arrnas: selenium-2.24.0-py2.7
[21:09:18] Arrnas: and 13.0.1 firefox
[21:10:07] Arrnas: and the darn thing still wont work, i made all of them single statements like ActionChains(browser).key_down(Keys.SHIFT, elem) and ActionChains(browser).perform() at the end and no errors but it still wont work
[21:11:40] lukeis: that's more what I'm accustom to seeing ;)  the action request is sent but it just doesn't do anything (or what i want) :)
[21:13:03] lukeis: you'll have to show us a page (with javascript) where we can reproduce it for us to help ya more. You should be able to do a full save off of the page
