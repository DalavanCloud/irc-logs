[15:13:38] Arrnas: hey guys, any idea how to install selnium python bindings without them being .egg files?

[16:00:47] moo-_-: Arrnas: egg files is the standard way to distribute python libraries - you wish to install them using .egg files
[16:01:16] moo-_-: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/
[16:02:14] Arrnas: but py2exe doesn't work with .egg files :<
[16:03:31] moo-_-: Arrnas: there should be way to bundle those files with any python software 
[16:03:37] moo-_-: Arrnas: they are in-fact just zip files with metadata
[16:03:59] moo-_-: Arrnas: you can probably just bundle up them with your other .py files and modify sys.path to load those libraries as it
[16:04:01] moo-_-: as is
[16:04:26] moo-_-: Arrnas: I suggest you open stackoverflow.com question and ask how .egg files should be handled with py2exe
[16:04:34] moo-_-: Arrnas: as this is not quite selenium specific question
[16:06:27] Arrnas: yeah i know, in theory easy_install --always-unzip should install them without the zip and adding zip_ok = 0 to distutils should also prevent egg files but nothing seems to help
[16:07:06] Arrnas: im not even sure they are zip files, its just a folder with .egg at then so i guess they're not .egg files as its not an extension 
[16:07:14] moo-_-: Arrnas: ah
[16:07:16] moo-_-: yes
[16:07:22] moo-_-: it can be folder or zip file
[16:07:26] moo-_-: both can be have .egg extension
[16:07:32] moo-_-: folder is just unextracted zip
[16:07:40] moo-_-: it can or can be source distribution
[16:07:44] moo-_-: meaning it has setup.py file
[16:07:50] moo-_-: sorry
[16:07:54] moo-_-: development distribution
[16:08:10] moo-_-: but will need to catch a pizza now ->
