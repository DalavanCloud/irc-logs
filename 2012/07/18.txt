[02:22:53] jsanchez011: Hey guys, general question here.. If I am using Implicit wait (say 30 seconds) BUT lets say I want it to only wait 5 seconds for 1 particular case as so --> (new WebDriverWait(driver, 5)).until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(By.id("this.should.time.out.in.5.seconds")));    why does it still wait 30 seconds?
[02:23:22] jsanchez011: I don't understand what is happening, before I started using the ExpectedConditions class this worked fine.. now it waits for the full implicit wait time

[11:42:00] infolinux: Hi all, When I start to build in Hudson and on the point that selenium comes in to play, I get the following error message: http://pastebin.com/Ymf1t1eZ. Can anybody support me to solve this?
[11:43:14] barancev: cannot create directory `//.mozilla': Permission denied
[11:43:32] infolinux: yes i see that.
[11:43:36] barancev: you are not permitted to create directories in the root
[11:43:59] infolinux: Why is it trying to create this dir in root?
[11:44:00] barancev: probably, your environment is not configured, Firefox can't find the user home directory
[11:44:49] barancev: can you run Firefox without selenium? how do you start the browser from tests?
[11:45:26] infolinux: I can start the browser with xwin.
[11:45:28] barancev: what account do you run Hudson from?
[11:46:23] infolinux: Hudson is running with the tomcat5 user
[11:47:28] barancev: so, must probably this user has no HOME configured, and you can't run Firefox and other apps under this account
[11:48:13] barancev: you have to assign a home directory for this account, and grant permissions to this dir
[11:48:29] infolinux: well, that is the strange part. ther tomcat5 user does have a Home configured and that is: /var/tomcat5

[12:00:37] selbot2: AutomatedTester: note from lukeis 1 day ago: the IE server wasn't being shut down. I think the first comment is the real issue, the second has to do with what they did to 'fix' their problem. Better link to actual comments: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/ie/service.py?spec=svn17445&r=17445#93  i have yet to try out python + IE Driver server, as soon as I do I can check on this... btw jimevans is the one who 
[12:01:25] barancev: infolinux: open Hudson console, create a new job, configure it to run firefox, save the job, run it by hands and look at the console log
[12:01:40] barancev: or just ask your hudson admin to help you configure it
[12:02:13] barancev: to be able to run fixefox from the hudson
[12:04:42] infolinux: ok I think thsi is it: http://pastebin.com/20Bv50Ai
[12:11:09] barancev: so, it's not selenium related, it's hudson can't run firefox
[12:12:04] barancev: 1) can you create /.mozilla and grant the permissions to hudson account to this dir? let firefox to use this directory if it wants to
[12:12:41] barancev: 2) 'no display specified' means you can't run graphical apps, like firefox, there is no display
[12:12:57] barancev: use xvfb or some other virtual X-server
[12:18:58] infolinux: ok thanks. gonna look into that.

[13:44:38] Wiz126: Is there a way to get the absolute path of the directory of the file being tested?
[13:46:02] RossPatterson: Wiz126: Assuming you mean in Selenium IDE, I don't think so.
[13:46:46] Wiz126: Ok, so the followup question would be: how would I go about testing a file upload?
[13:47:30] Wiz126: Without specifying the whole path as that wouldn't be the same for other developers.
[13:48:26] RossPatterson: Wiz126: How are you doing the upload already?
[13:49:27] Wiz126: specifying the value for an id and hitting save works
[13:50:22] Wiz126: I didn't have any of the issues people seem to have from what I saw when I goolged the issue.
[13:52:40] AutomatedTester: the IDE will not be bound by the JS Sandbox as much
[13:55:31] RossPatterson: So you're looking for a file relative to the path that the test script was loaded from.  Unfortunately, I don't believe IDE has a way for you to learn that.

[16:48:09] simonstewart: preparetointeractWith_ wasn't available then
[16:48:25] barancev: so, prepareToInteractWith_ is considered preferrable?

[17:39:16] jimevans: barancev: probably. i need a little more context, like where in the codebase you're referring to.
[17:39:21] barancev: btw, error code 6 is not documented in :wiki JsonWireProtocol

[17:44:47] barancev: lukeis: jimevans: so, IE makes no difference between "no active session" and "no active window", right?
[17:45:47] jimevans: barancev: at the moment, no. it's probably an oversight on my part.
[17:46:09] barancev: ok, understood
[17:46:49] jimevans: the command handlers for switch to window remap the error code to ENOSUCHWINDOW
[17:46:53] rdarcy has joined #selenium
[17:49:05] jimevans: that code was implemented a long time ago, so my recollection of what i was thinking is a little hazy, but if i recall right, my logic was that NoSuchWindowException was defined to be thrown if you tried to switch to a window that didn't exist. attempting to execute a command when no window or an invalid window was previously switched to was undefined, so i wanted to return a separate error code that meant "undefined"
[17:49:54] jimevans: i think we've actually changed semantics of when NoSuchWindowException should be thrown since then, and i haven't kept up.
