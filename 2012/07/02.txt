[15:44:54] Dude-X: it bothers me that i confuse closure with clojure
[15:46:52] simonstewart: It's worse that they're homophones
[15:47:25] Dude-X: i prononuce the j in clojure as the j in just
[15:47:45] simonstewart: I believe that they're both pronounced "closure"
[15:47:55] simonstewart: I've been wrong on many, many occasions before.
[15:48:06] llaskin: i pronounce it similar to a "zh" sound clozhure
[15:48:18] *dawagner pronounces clojure with the j, know it's wrong, but to aid clarity
[15:48:34] simonstewart: I say "closure with a j" if I'm talking about clojure
[15:48:50] dawagner: It helps that I rarely talk about clojure
[15:50:54] *dawagner is doing that debugging thing where he throws exceptions inside conditionals to work out which line of code is failing

[16:03:39] barancev: I was trying to investigate #2521 (and some other where we get WebDriverException: null)

[16:04:22] barancev: the parameter 'result' is an error message that cannot be wrapped, that's why we get null
[16:04:47] softmanpetro: will $webdriver->executeScript("arguments[0].style.display = 'block';", array($elements)); apply the visibility to $elements ? it looks no . . .

[16:09:17] simonstewart: softmanpetro: no
[16:09:27] softmanpetro: :)
[16:09:31] simonstewart: But you'll get an array of elements in your JS in arguments[0]

[16:21:35] Gungy: how do i get around an issue i have in webdriver where i click an option in the left menu tree and in the right pane loads a table using ajax - but webdriver is not finding a particular button on that table - ive doubled checked its id and its correct....
[16:23:01] Dude-X: gungy, click, then either wait for some javascript activity to completed (maybe like jQuery.active == 0 is true) or wait for some other element that is the last element in the dom to be visible
[16:23:17] Dude-X: (it is true when isDisplayed() is called)
[16:23:20] softmanpetro: simonstewart http://pastebin.com/iHRjgiKR
[16:23:30] Dude-X: then you can look up the id and then click or get text

[16:42:57] barancev: only Object.getPrototypeOf(result) == 'Error' is true for this error object
[16:43:37] barancev: is it allowed to add such a condition to Utils.wrapResult?
[16:44:04] softmanpetro: this code http://pastebin.com/kd6qGXnr is showing 1-1 for the first tab which is visible and - - - for the others 3 simonstewart
[16:46:00] softmanpetro: so it looks is not changing the attribute needed to isDisplayed be true
[16:46:36] simonstewart: Are thr elements actually displayed in the browser?
[16:48:01] softmanpetro: no.. only the one contained in the tab1 , in the source I can see them
[16:48:15] softmanpetro: in the page source
[16:48:21] simonstewart: Then webdriver is working, but the JS isn't quite right :)
[16:48:30] softmanpetro: ok
[16:52:00] softmanpetro: if this line is fine ... there is nothing else which could fail simonstewart $webdriver->executeScript("arguments[0].style.display = 'block';", array($el));
[16:53:05] simonstewart: You need to loop in the JS: "var els = arguments[0]; for (var i = 0; i < els.length; i++) { els[i].style.display = 'block'; }"
[16:53:24] simonstewart: An array doesn't have a "style" property

[22:07:11] Dude-X: comparing images?
[22:07:24] Dude-X: you cant do so directly
[22:08:59] crome: few days ago there was someone who did that
[22:11:18] hellome: Dude-X @do so directly? 
[22:11:21] adamgoucher: hellome: nirvdrum does it for a living. sorta.
[22:11:23] hellome: not sure what you mean
[22:12:32] lukeis: he's referring to mogotest.com
[22:12:34] jarib has joined #selenium
[22:13:31] Dude-X: well image compare like the whole browser window or a specifc image
[22:13:39] Dude-X: selenium can do screenshots of the browser window
[22:13:49] hellome: specific images 
[22:14:02] Dude-X: (or rather it seems of the entire page loaded in the browser)
[22:14:08] lukeis: you'll need to use another tool to do image comparison
[22:14:27] Dude-X: how would you grab those images using webdriver? execute_script?
[22:14:30] hellome: so its a part of the web-browser.. 
[22:14:35] hellome: what i need to test is that
[22:14:46] hellome: when i rotate this image.. it indeed does rotate
[22:15:30] lukeis: if you hash the file's output, everytime you run this rotation does the hash change? or can you compare the hashes?
[22:16:01] lukeis: (hash == md5 or other equivalent)
[22:16:17] hellome: but that is not true UI test is it.. i mean when i rotate the image.. 
[22:16:27] hellome: the image holder elements height and width change 
[22:16:42] AutomatedTester: hellome: does it reload the image?
[22:16:42] lukeis: is it a new image file rendered?
[22:16:55] hellome: i can use that for verification too.. but then again.. its the holder i am verifying not the image itself
[22:17:16] lukeis: then you can just look at the height and width attributes of the holder
[22:17:23] hellome: its a browser panel that displays a scaned image .. 
[22:17:47] hellome: yes i thought of that .. but that is not a true image test is there
[22:18:11] AutomatedTester: hellome: is the image reloaded on rotation?
[22:18:52] lukeis: if the image is "new" then you can/ should do both, checking the height/width and the hash of the new file
[22:19:03] hellome: AuotomatedTester@ let me find that out
[22:19:30] hellome: i am still not certain what you mean by checking the hash of the file
[22:19:51] ignacio__ has joined #selenium
[22:20:04] lukeis: download the image file displayed, run an md5 hash against it... it generates a unique hex value
[22:20:35] lukeis: compare that hex value with a known good value
[22:20:55] Dude-X: how would you download it, curl, or some url-lib like library?
[22:21:06] lukeis: too many options there to count ;)
[22:21:18] lukeis: i would use whatever native language you are in though
[22:21:22] Dude-X: does that include the webdriver api?

[22:34:47] lukeis: jimevans: how 'bout you work on making all those html5 gizmos work in ie6 ;)
[22:34:57] hellome: hahahaha RT!!
[22:35:01] jimevans: :-P
[22:35:45] jimevans: until IE8 has reached the end of its life cycle, i can't really say that html5 is viable.
[22:35:57] hellome: but guys seriously.. any help would be great with this DANG image comparison 
[22:36:07] hellome: here is the test scenario.. 
[22:36:09] AutomatedTester: hellome: do histogram comparisons
[22:36:24] hellome: histogram comparison? 
[22:36:48] hellome: so i login to a test website
[22:37:04] AutomatedTester: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/843972/image-comparison-fast-algorithm
[22:37:07] hellome: it has a image viewer panel, part of the browser split using division panels
[22:37:17] hellome: and then this image can be rotated left/right/180
[22:37:25] hellome: now my tests needs to verify that it is doing so
[22:38:49] jimevans has left #selenium
[22:46:33] hellome: so there is a way for me to save the image to a file path
[22:46:40] erratic: ohai to paige

[22:49:41] AutomatedTester: yes
[22:50:04] Dude-X: is apple, microsoft interested in such a thing?

[23:03:20] barancev: jleyba was faster :)
[23:04:37] barancev: hmm... no, javascript tests should fail, only java was fixed by the last commit

[23:50:44] santiycr: seems like both FF12 and FF13 don't interact will with the HTTP proxy built in Selenium
[23:50:55] santiycr: s/will/well
[23:51:20] Dude-X: what kind of issues
[23:51:32] AutomatedTester: santiycr: issue #?
[23:56:42] santiycr: I don't think I got to log it
