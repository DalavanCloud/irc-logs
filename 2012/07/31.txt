[00:00:52] Dude-X: If XML is the answer, then your question is wrong :p
[00:02:57] sixpindin: Oh no I didn't meant that, xml is not the answer, I was just saying how it had occured to me that xml was enums in enums (i think) - anyway, sorry for fouling-up the channel with my waffle.
[00:03:37] Dude-X: look up dictonary, in Java it's the Map concept
[00:07:40] sixpindin: I'm familiar with the dictionary, but I needed the values to be primitive so that I could get compile-time checking and intellsense, etc - I just wanted a static list of values, available as arguments and enforced as parameters on certain methods (will also make linq query-building easier I guess) - So couldn't use a dictionary
[00:08:16] sixpindin: Unless I can! - if-so tell me and I'll go and read-up - like I said, I'm a noob progammer and people keep showing me cool stuff that blows my mind
[00:09:31] Dude-X: yeah sounds like an enum to me, but i would use an Enum class pattern
[00:11:07] sixpindin: Ok, you mean just nesting them inside each-other? - I'll look that pattern up anyway, I'd started to read 'design patterns' written in 1984 and makes so much sense even today, and even to a noob. So I'm keen to read about patterns.
[00:11:25] ian_mac2 has joined #selenium
[00:11:26] Dude-X: more like Effective Java 2nd edition Enum Class
[00:11:39] Dude-X: not design patterns which is more about OO stuff

[00:12:16] sixpindin: sorry oo
[00:12:19] sixpindin: {FACEPALM{
[00:12:34] Dude-X: Object Oriented Programming
[00:15:10] sixpindin: yea design patterns is set well in OO land and some of the stuff (like visitor pattern) looks to be easier and cleaner with extension-methods in C# or even with the generic delegates (if I've understood properly) but I guess the cool thing about design patterns is that they only rely on basic OO principles so can be used in any OO languauge, unlike extension-methods, genertics and even delegates? (I'm sure most oo languages have some kind of
[00:15:52] Dude-X: well Java is the worst OO language i've used (well may be C++ is, but it's really a systems language)
[00:16:30] Dude-X: but design patterns today can generally be distlled to a few types
[00:17:42] sixpindin: I've used a java a bit, but I love c#, never used c++ (respect) - ObjectiveC looks interesting but my next languauge will be functional, F# maybe -
[00:18:22] Dude-X: C# is not bad because Microsoft can evolve the language fater
[00:18:34] Dude-X: faster, but the drawback is you're tied to Microsoft
[00:18:57] Dude-X: Objective C is rather ugly, but once you know a language like Python and embrace the C way of thinking, it's not too bad, except for the ugly syntax
[00:19:38] sixpindin: I'm not sure about distilling patterns, from the ones that I've seen, (Provider, factory, visitor, context) are the ones that I can't distill, and I'm sure there are so many more
[00:19:56] Dude-X: don't worry about it for now
[00:20:05] Dude-X: once you start working on big projects, it will make sense
[00:20:16] sixpindin: + Agreed in C# although the mono project looks good

[15:16:05] miro1: the idea was to slow down selenium to be able to follow the single actions visually
[15:17:31] davehunt has joined #selenium
[15:18:16] miro1: the documentation about setSpeed says: Set execution speed (i.e., set the millisecond length of a delay which will follow each selenium operation).
[15:19:10] miro1: what is also a little bit strange is that a string needs to be passed to setSpeed
[15:19:40] jimevans: miro1: that's the RC documentation, right?
[15:20:11] miro1: it's from here: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/index.html
[15:22:14] jimevans: you have to realize that WebDriverBackedSelenium is an implementation of the Selenium RC API. it's intended to be used as a wrapper to help migrate from Selenium RC to Selenium WebDriver. RC very very old API. the new WebDriver API doesn't allow you to do everything that the RC does (by design), but the wrapper doesn't throw an error, so that people with existing code won't encounter errors.
[15:22:50] jimevans: bottom line, you can't do what you want to do with webdriver, which means you can't do it with WebDriverBackedSelenium either, because it's based on webdriver.
[15:23:33] Dude-X: hey how do i enable the setting to automatically handle alerts
[15:23:44] miro1: is there any better documentation, which focuses only on the WebDriver part?
[15:24:59] miro1: jimevans: thanks for the enlightenment
[15:25:09] jimevans: http://seleniumhq.org/ maybe?
[15:25:49] jimevans: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html
[15:27:11] miro1: I'm looking for some documentation that shows me the whole API
[15:27:35] jimevans: then the API is documented where you were looking at before. simply ignore WebDriverBackedSelenium.
[15:27:57] jimevans: :apidocs is the complete API documentation.
[15:27:58] selbot2: .NET: http://goo.gl/Fm3cw | Java: http://goo.gl/kKQqM | Ruby: http://goo.gl/cFyyT | Python: http://goo.gl/5yWoR
[15:28:36] miro1: ok, but as a selenium newbie I don't know what else needs to be ignored from this source
[15:30:06] jimevans: i'd suggest anything that is in any of the com.thoughtworks… packages, or anything descendent from them.
[15:30:22] dawagner has joined #selenium
[15:30:23] selbot2: dawagner: note from andreastt about 6 hours ago: What would it involve to add Opera Mobile testing to the CI?  Do we need request something from Sauce? 
[15:30:23] jimevans: (which would include WebDriverBackedSelenium, incidentally)
[15:30:45] dawagner: andreastt: What would be required for me to run an Opera Mobile test?
[15:30:52] dawagner: :seen krosenvold
[15:30:52] selbot2: krosenvold was last seen 13 days ago, quitting.
[15:31:18] andreastt: dawagner: The OperaDriver JAR and a compatible Opera Mobile build.
[15:31:22] andreastt: (To be released…)
[15:31:36] andreastt: That should read, Opera Mobile Emulator build.
[15:32:06] miro1: thanks for the hint
[15:33:09] jimevans: np
[15:36:23] chogan has joined #selenium
[15:36:43] dawagner: If you create a ./go target which runs the tests, and check in (or send me) an Opera Mobile build, I can set that up for you without having to lean on Sauce
[15:37:02] andreastt: dawagner: I've already checked in rake tasks for it.
[15:37:31] dawagner: What do I run to run it? (Sorry, I've been a bit out of touch with open source land recently)
[15:37:34] andreastt: Still waiting for a public build.
[15:37:57] andreastt: ./go test_opera_mobile if you have it installed basically
[15:37:59] dawagner: As soon as you can get me a public build, I can get the tests up and running :)
[15:38:07] andreastt: Cool, just wondered
[15:38:13] andreastt: I expect to have it tomorrow.
[15:38:13] dawagner: (Or a private build, of course :p)
[15:38:19] dawagner: Woo!
[15:38:35] andreastt: That would be a breach of my NDA from hell.
[15:38:42] andreastt: )-:
[15:39:19] dawagner: Opera not so big on giving things to... Technically competitors!?
[15:39:39] andreastt: In my opinion we should be doing that, but hey.

[15:43:10] Dude-X: if i want to take advantage of automatic JS modal alerts, I have to pass a firefox binary object, a firefox profile AND a capabilities object?

[15:43:33] dawagner: Dude-X: No, there's a FirefoxDriver(Capabilities) constructor...
[15:43:42] Dude-X: how do i load firebug though?
[15:44:01] dawagner: You can add a FirefoxProfile as a capability
[15:44:12] Dude-X: ooh
[15:44:18] dawagner: capabilities.setCapability(FirefoxDriver.PROFILE, FirefoxProfile) Or something similar

So if I get the current URL of the new page, or try to find an element on the new page it will not work because driver thinks it is still at the previous page. Has anyone found a fix for this? Or know what I'm doing wrong?

[18:05:21] Jack2093: Ok so if I do something like this: driver.find_element({:link =>"What Is This?"}).click
[18:05:29] Jack2093: and then do "driver.current_url"
[18:05:44] Jack2093: It will return the URL of the previous page, not the page that "What is This?" redirects to
[18:06:13] Dude-X: okay so then write a WebDriverWait that will match on the expected URL

[22:03:38] AutomatedTester: argg typing tests are making me sad
[22:04:17] simonstewart: Because they're so demanding?

[22:04:42] simonstewart: stephend: yt?
[22:04:51] AutomatedTester: no because they fail on my test but when I replicate the test in a REPL it passes
[22:04:57] simonstewart: focus
[22:04:58] AutomatedTester: and it has the same focus
[22:05:03] simonstewart: That's the problem
