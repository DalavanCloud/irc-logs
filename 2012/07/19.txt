[12:37:49] RossPatterson: Mozilla's "Marionette" is the likely base for a future Firefox driver.
[12:39:15] SamuraiJack: ok, I see
[12:44:46] andreastt: The only reason the OperaDriver is shipped with the standalone JAR is because it's fairly convenient to do so.

[13:09:52] lazymanc: I'm having the following issue: https://gist.github.com/3143439
[13:10:02] simonstewart: Though if you switch frame then any references you have will appear to become stale
[13:10:07] simonstewart: probably
[13:10:42] simonstewart: Depending on the driver
[13:11:09] andreastt: He sent me a patch for proxy support for Opera.
[13:11:18] andreastt: The patch is cool, but it uses the wrong JSON keys.
[13:11:29] simonstewart: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KE0njnZXyY
[13:11:30] *andreastt has a go at fixing it
[13:12:07] SamuraiJack: probably was asked before, but can't find anything in FAQ - how I can detect that "driver.get(url)" failed (loaded 404 page)?
[13:12:41] andreastt: That the browser loads a 404 is not considered a failure.
[13:12:50] lazymanc: simonstewart: can you see why my $rows would become stale in that code example?
[13:13:13] SamuraiJack: thats why there's no exception, right?
[13:13:14] andreastt: SamuraiJack: WebDriver will instruct the browser what to do, but is not concerned with how the browser handles a 404.
[13:13:24] andreastt: SamuraiJack: In fact, WebDriver doesn't know about HTTP status codes at all.
[13:13:29] simonstewart: Is it possible the UI is updating?
[13:13:37] SamuraiJack: andreastt: hm.. how to detect that then?
[13:14:12] andreastt: SamuraiJack: Well, if your web app sends a custom 404 message of some kind, you can make a check for the correct page is displayed.
[13:14:16] lazymanc: simonstewart: it doesn't appear to, the popup appears, I can close it, but then I can't get the next lot of cells
[13:14:41] andreastt: SamuraiJack: If you absolutely need to check for HTTP status codes you need a proxy in between WebDriver and your web app that records the HTTP status codes, however.
[13:14:51] davehunt: SamuraiJack: whatever you do next is likely to fail because your test will be expecting a valid page. If you're testing 404s then try finding an appropriate element
[13:15:13] simonstewart: "popup"?
[13:15:31] SamuraiJack: andreastt, davehunt: ok, thanks
[13:15:40] lazymanc: simonstewart: it's a js dialog 
[13:15:45] lazymanc: with a close button
[13:15:48] simonstewart: dawagner: are you on holiday or the US?
[13:15:53] simonstewart: or both
[13:16:02] simonstewart: lazymanc: opened with "window.alert" or similar?
[13:16:09] simonstewart: Or just plain HTML?
[13:16:10] davehunt: simonstewart: mind commenting on #moz774892 ?

[13:17:08] NeptuNooo has joined #selenium
[13:17:11] davehunt: simonstewart: I suspect the Firefox fix would be the correct solution, rather than activating via Selenium
[13:17:23] davehunt: (read comment 3)
[13:17:27] simonstewart: Indeed
[13:17:59] davehunt: We can nominate this to Aurora/Beta too, would be awesome if this lets us enable focusmanager.testmode again
[13:18:22] simonstewart: Commented
[13:20:25] davehunt: simonstewart: so you're suggesting enabling the pref via Menu/UI? I wasn't expecting that :)
[13:20:40] simonstewart: Well, if it's enabled, the UI should indicate it
[13:20:53] simonstewart: And therefore present a way of toggling the state
[13:21:11] NeptuNooo: where can i find main fixes made to selenium 2.25 ?
[13:21:14] NeptuNooo: is there sth like this ?
[13:21:30] simonstewart: The main confusion for users is "I can't type into this browser, why not?"
[13:21:34] lazymanc: simonstewart: it's a div that gets injected into the html and displayed as a modal popup
[13:21:38] simonstewart: NeptuNooo: take a look at the changelog
[13:21:48] NeptuNooo: thx
[13:21:56] andreastt: Is Proxy (in Selenium) JSON-compatible?
[13:22:02] andreastt: Yes… yes, it is.
[13:22:05] simonstewart: yup
[13:22:07] simonstewart: We can encode it
[13:22:11] davehunt: simonstewart: That wouldn't solve this issue though. We want Selenium to be able to type into the fields, and it sounds like this would happen if the window is activated when the testmode is on.
[13:22:11] andreastt: Excellent
[13:22:31] simonstewart: Ahhh.. then this should be tied to the "inject events directly into the event queue" bug
[13:22:38] simonstewart: The two are closely related
[13:23:14] davehunt: As I understand it, that bug is about getting browser level interactions rather than the current OS level ones for 'native events'
[13:23:33] davehunt: But yes, they are related
[13:24:01] davehunt: This would allow the OS level ones to work with the focus manager test mode enabled
[13:24:13] simonstewart: FocusManager was put in to deal with the nasty problem of focus/blur events not firing properly when the browser didn't have OS focus
[13:24:16] simonstewart: (IIRC)
[13:24:31] simonstewart: The OS-level events aren't the best way to go, though
[13:24:40] davehunt: simonstewart: yep, and it works when native events aren't used
[13:24:41] simonstewart: Injecting directly into the event queue is :)
[13:24:48] simonstewart: davehunt: right
[13:25:00] simonstewart: The proposal to use nsDOMWindowUtils doesn't really cut it
[13:25:04] davehunt: no, we want to move away from the OS level, but I'm guessing that will take some time
[13:25:05] xtian_ has joined #selenium
[13:25:26] simonstewart: From memory, it's using a less than optimal API and isn't implemented on every platform
[13:25:31] simonstewart: (eg: OS X)
[13:25:40] davehunt: simonstewart: can you comment on that other bug about why nsDOMWindowUtils isn't suitable? That would be handy
[13:25:57] simonstewart: Yes
[13:26:05] simonstewart: I'll need to spend some quality time with mxr first
[13:26:08] simonstewart: link to that too?
[13:26:12] davehunt: We already have the attention of Olli, and he's certainly the right guy :)

[16:00:34] simonstewart: yes
[16:00:40] simonstewart: (dawagner)
[16:01:00] eranm: dawagner, the trouble with the java IE tests is that they don't automatically pick up the freshly-built copy of IEDriverServer.exe
[16:01:13] dawagner: eranm: They can be made to pretty easily...
[16:01:50] eranm: which is exactly what I'm doing now
[16:01:52] simonstewart: In the case of firefox, if a proxy is set on the profile, in a desired capability and in a required capability, the one in the required takes precedence 
[16:02:17] simonstewart: With the one in the profile only be used if neither set of capabilities have a proxy set
[16:02:51] simonstewart: eranm: that's probably my bad
[16:02:56] simonstewart: (discussed offline)
[16:03:27] simonstewart: andreastt: so if a user reuses a profile after starting a browser, then the first instance will have the original proxy setting and the second instance the second proxy setting

[20:03:27] nirvdrum: I'll look into it more.  My gut is they had an exception or something that broke the connection to IE.  Grid thus can't tell that the close session command succeeded and needs to wait for the timeout period to expire.
[20:03:45] jimevans: right. fair enough.
[20:06:20] nirvdrum: I've seen precisely that.  The close session command succeeded on the node but somehow an exception was raised or the network link broke, so the hub didn't know.
[20:06:29] nirvdrum: bbiab.

[21:02:25] julienresaas: TestingTimes: writing a test asserting against a moving target is not the right approach
[21:03:27] TestingTimes: Ok what if I just searched page one for the Search Result - if not found move to the next page and search?
[21:03:54] julienresaas: no, I think what you should think about doing is propping your data through some automated means
[21:04:25] julienresaas: so that when you execute a search, you will consistently see it on page x
[21:06:40] TestingTimes: Its a Web based app - were the data it could be hundred Candidates one and 500 the next day.

[21:08:31] TestingTimes: Freeze the data on the Database?
[21:08:42] julienresaas: or, have a separate database for testing
[21:09:19] TestingTimes: But what if I wanted, to the run my Auto Test on another Database?
[21:10:20] julienresaas: sure you can always do that too; but then, you'll run into problems of data clashing with your automated tests
[21:11:45] julienresaas: you want to minimize external dependencies a much as possible
[21:12:27] julienresaas: variances in your test environment will make your automated test that much more complex
[21:12:31] TestingTimes: So if I had a variable (the data wanted), then searched any Database - I could find it... on Page 20 or Page 1001.

[21:16:30] julienresaas: does it have to be a specific result that you want to Assert on?
[21:16:40] TestingTimes: just the Search Result
[21:17:32] dawagner: Hack hack hack...
[21:17:45] julienresaas: so, why not just test for the existance of the search result parent div
[21:18:17] TestingTimes: I'm looking for a Client which, is in with so hundred or so?
[21:19:53] julienresaas: like someone mentioned before, i don't think selenium is the right tool for you in this case
[21:20:03] julienresaas: there are way too many layers that you have to contend with
[21:20:15] Zack: agreed
[21:20:17] TestingTimes: <julienresaas> There could be 100 pages with 10 search results on them.
[21:20:34] julienresaas: i would say this is something like a database unit test could achieve
[21:21:05] TestingTimes: really Unit tests?
[21:22:32] Zack: seleniums purpose is to mimic users in a browser no?
[21:23:04] Zack: or along the lines of performing tasks a user would in a browser
[21:23:27] julienresaas: if you're looking for a specific piece of data from a search call, why test it through the UI?
[21:23:32] julienresaas: go to a deeper layer
[21:23:41] Zack: ^^
[21:23:53] TestingTimes: Indeed, so the could look through 9 pages, to find the find the correct Search Result.

[23:28:29] somethingn: Dude-X, me?
[23:28:35] Dude-X: yes

[23:35:20] Dude-X: have you tried a different locator?
[23:35:32] kurapikats: im using the elements id
[23:35:47] somethingn: Dude-X, do you use the PageObject design pattern, but any chance?
[23:35:54] somethingn: or who here uses the PageObject design pattern?
[23:36:09] somethingn: ...and do you use LoadableComponent and SlowLoadableComponent subclasses?
[23:37:18] Dude-X: i don't use the page object design pattern, but i don't use the PageObject factory that's in the Java client
[23:37:35] Dude-X: err i use the page object design pattern, not the pageObject factory...
[23:37:44] somethingn: alright
[23:38:25] somethingn: does anyone have a good recipe for telling whether an element has loaded in a page without using a Wait?
[23:38:39] somethingn: like "boolean elementIsPresent()" ?
[23:38:41] Dude-X: there's a class called WebDriverWait
[23:38:56] somethingn: yea, I'm trying to use a boolean of some kind, not a wait
[23:39:07] Dude-X: sorry that won't work
[23:39:14] Dude-X: it's not a fixed wait
[23:39:22] Dude-X: it will wait up to the timeout
[23:39:46] jimevans: somethingn: the way to do that is attempt to find the element using findElement or findElements. in the case of findElement, catch the exception if the element isn't there. in the case of findElements, check the size of the returned collection to see if it's not 0.
[23:39:49] somethingn: well, I know WebDriverWait won't do what I want (or I can't find a way)
[23:40:25] jimevans: but i honestly have no idea how to work that into the LoadableComponent
[23:40:47] somethingn: jimevans: Thanks.  That's what I'm doing now, but I'm trying to do it in the context of the isLoaded() method of a SlowLoadableComponent class
[23:40:50] Dude-X: sometimes you have to wait for some other element before you can interact with the one you want, especially if you have a lot of ajaxy components/widgets
[23:41:00] somethingn: ...which means I need to catch the exception, then turn around and throw an error or something
[23:41:15] somethingn: ...I think
[23:42:33] somethingn: so right now I'm catching the NoSuchObject exception (or whatever it is), and I'm trying to throw an error, but that's not working
[23:42:39] somethingn: and I don't know why
[23:42:50] somethingn: I'm trying assert(false) and everything
[23:43:01] somethingn: nothing wants to work
[23:43:28] somethingn: and I would assume I'm not trying to do anything that a bunch of other selenium users aren't doing
[23:43:35] somethingn: ...thus the questions
[23:43:36] somethingn: anyway
[23:43:41] somethingn: this is annoying
[23:43:43] jimevans: somethingn: i hate to say it, but i'm going to be useless helping you figure this out. i don't use the java PageFactory either.
[23:44:02] jimevans: (or the *LoadableComponents)

[23:51:52] somethingn: cool deal
[23:52:00] somethingn: haha
[23:52:11] Dude-X: somethingn: webdriver is an integral part of our web development
[23:52:19] somethingn: well, WebDriver itself seems to be lacking so many convenience stuff
[23:52:34] Dude-X: it does, but i wrote a wrapper to the driver API
[23:53:12] Dude-X: so that i just use my wrapper and not have to code all the waits and exception handling
[23:53:22] somethingn: yea, I'd love to do that...I have a few convenience methods here and there.
[23:53:42] somethingn: well, it's to hear somebody is doing that
[23:53:50] somethingn: have you thought about contributing that to the Selenium folks?
[23:54:04] somethingn: ...I get the sense that they could use the help
[23:54:05] Dude-X: stephend: one thing i am going to use that i learned from your codebase is using locators that are self contained. like button = (By.xpath, '//div'); i am going to implement the same in Java!

[23:58:20] Dude-X: i'm not sure how I can adopt that to my tests
[23:58:43] Dude-X: but it's something i can adopt for my automation scripts i am working on to help our QA quickly create data sets
[23:59:34] somethingn: Dude-X, so did you look at SlowLoadableComponents, and just decide that they didn't do what you wanted them to do?
