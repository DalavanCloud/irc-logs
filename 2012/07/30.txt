[11:09:48] andreastt: Good morning, guys
[11:12:21] eranm: morning andreastt 
[11:12:30] andreastt: eranm: Hey there.
[11:36:22] eranm: andreastt, does the OperaDriver currently export logging information in any way?
[11:37:03] andreastt: What kind of logs are you thinking of?
[11:37:13] andreastt: For the new Logging interface?
[11:43:11] eranm: yes
[11:43:25] eranm: One change we'll do is export the level as a string, rather than an integer
[11:43:35] andreastt: Scope has a console logger service, but it's not been implemented in OperaDriver yet.
[11:43:46] eranm: But if it does not implement the logs wire protocol command then it won't be affected
[11:43:50] eranm: ok
[11:44:07] andreastt: Yeah, don't worry about breaking anything (-:

[12:41:20] foolx: following situation: I run a test, the test got's stuck (loading never finishes). I let java run the test in a futures thread with timeout, canceling the test after 120 seconds. My build is now "unstable" and i got no result. Just like i wanted. Still, the WebDriver on my Selenium Server is still open and never finishes. Even after hours! Is there any way to let those "dismissed" tests die?
[12:47:08] eranm: foolx, have you invoked quit() on the WebDriver instance?
[12:48:59] eranm: First, I would check why page loading never finishes. If that happens infrequently, you have flaky tests on your hands. Such tests reduce developer confidence in the tests and add noise to the build logs.
[12:49:24] eranm: Third-party resources being loaded? non-hermetic test environment? Your server sometimes not returning? I'd check all of those.
[12:50:15] eranm: Regardless, I'd suggest terminating the JVM that runs the tests. This guarantees clean state of the tests.
[12:50:17] foolx: hi eranm! the errors are somehow related to the cdn we are using. I already used third party tool gomez (really good for time-check etc) and it also tells me this random error with cdn
[12:50:53] eranm: Do you need the content from the cdn for the tests?
[12:51:23] foolx: i have a java class that creates the driver and "finally" has to quit it. This finally just never happens when the future.class is closed from the main class because it got stuck. Finally just happens when the class itself chooses to dismiss itself
[12:52:16] foolx: with JVM you mean a java virtual machine? We never got VM to work stable, so we use real pcs for testing. Or do you mean the selenium server ?
[12:53:39] rbalent has joined #selenium
[12:54:20] eranm: foolx, yes, the Java Virtual Machine
[12:56:47] foolx: so for my understanding: the JVM is the execution of the java code on my selenium server right?
[12:57:32] beakerman has joined #selenium
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Jul 30 13:02:43 2012]
[13:02:43] eranm: There are two things: The Selenium Server (which is usually run in a JVM of its own) and the JVM that runs the tests
[13:03:28] eranm: The Selenium server can be left to run between tests, as it cleans up the sessions (there's a timeout for that)
[13:03:44] eranm: But the JVM running the tests should, ideally, be killed and pre-sorted for another set of tests.
[13:03:45] foolx: so when i start the selenium server with -java blabla.jar etc pp, i start a JVM right?
[13:03:51] eranm: Yes
[13:04:24] foolx: okay, this instance of JVM then is killed, the thread ends, but the created firefox window as webdriver isn't closed

[16:03:59] AutomatedTester: or from the java service?
[16:04:04] ssims: We are able to access them on  windows with native events. On a mac if native events is on and the window is not focused.

[16:04:50] foolx: i can't tell for sure. The .get() is never finishing, because an object is missing, so when the future timeout hits, he shuts down the thread and starts the new one

[16:13:07] AutomatedTester: foolx: ahh sorry, I thought you were discussing Selenium
[16:13:52] foolx: we are not? ;)
[16:14:11] foolx: i use java, but the "doesn't work" comes from selenium or?
[16:14:25] AutomatedTester: i think its from your test executor
[16:15:00] foolx: the test executor kills the thread right, but only because both timeouts from selenium/webdriver don't catch
[16:15:19] foolx: i add             driver.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(4, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
[16:15:19] foolx:  and             driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
[16:16:09] foolx: but even then a simple driver.get(URL) does never finish when there is a problem with cdn and the firefox never returns "i am finish"... so after 120 seconds, the executor kills the future-thread and firefox stays open forever

[16:19:08] foolx: the executor waits for the future-thread to end. When it tooks longer then 120 seconds, he loses his patience and kills the thread. This can only happen when the thread itself runs longer than any wait inside, because it normaly only takes about ... 10-20 seconds
[16:19:34] AutomatedTester: foolx: when it kills the thread does it call driver.quit90

[16:20:04] foolx: AT: no, it can't. The driver is created inside the thread
[16:21:10] Dude-X: are you wrting your own test framework, why not use TestNG / junit?
[16:22:00] foolx: Dude-X: me?
[16:22:44] AutomatedTester: foolx: thats the problem 
[16:22:52] foolx: i never got that stuff working, wiki and stuff was to complicated to find my way into it. And i don't have the best boss to wait until i do, so fast solution before stable solution
[16:24:52] adamgoucher: andreastt and thats when you bug cgoldberg to bug someone in-house :D
[16:26:05] cgoldberg: andreastt, adamgoucher, wha wha?  I use Unity 3d.. have actually never tried selenium with Unity2.. could give it a try
[16:26:47] foolx: AT: but when i want to create the driver before the actual testing, i would have to create as much driver as i got pages later and send them into the threads ... well could be a more working solution at least ;)
[16:27:13] AutomatedTester: possibly
[16:27:34] AutomatedTester: but as someone who builds frameworks for a living, dont build a framework unless you have to
[16:28:44] foolx: AT: i would not have, but when i have two options: build own framework and keep job, or try to use stuff that is not dokumented enough to understand and use it and lose job,.... what would you choose?
[16:29:06] Dude-X: switch to python
[16:30:12] foolx: it is so much better than java that it will really pay off to change the whole system and throw away everything i already did?
[16:30:49] Dude-X: in python I can write code like this: button = (By.Id, '#button')
[16:31:12] Dude-X: in Java it took me a few hours to come up a Locator class, and an UnformattedLocator class to the above
[16:31:24] Dude-X: to do the above concept
[16:32:09] Dude-X: type safety is useful i guess, but Java is such an ornery language that I have to work around its lack of expressiveness
[16:33:30] Dude-X: the UnformattedLocator class i wrote is full of repetive code to handle the different locator types (Id, class, css selector, etc)

[16:47:32] emaugust: Hi all - newb question - what is the preferred way to select a value from a select box?
[16:47:49] emaugust: I was using sendkeys, but it wasnt selecting the proper value even though the sendkeys text was case and full word matched
[16:48:04] emaugust: I tried to do a 		Select select = new Select(driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id='selState']"))); 		select.selectByVisibleText("GOA");
[16:48:09] emaugust: but that isnt working either
[16:49:53] cmcgraw has joined #selenium
[16:50:42] Dude-X: is it really a regular select box?
[16:50:46] emaugust: hmmm after adding a 3 second thread sleep, now the selectByVisible Text is working
[16:50:50] emaugust: so I guess there is my answer
[16:51:35] Dude-X: use a WebDriverWait
[16:52:30] emaugust: instead of thread.sleep?
[16:52:54] Dude-X: yes, it waits until a specified condition
[16:53:10] emaugust: hmm
[16:54:11] nhirata has joined #selenium
[16:56:20] emaugust: is there an easy way to implement WebDriverWait
[16:56:28] emaugust: for a page load? It seems like it is used to wait for specific elements
[16:56:39] SamuraiJack has joined #selenium
[16:56:47] Dude-X: WebDriver only works with WebElements
[16:57:03] Dude-X: you can make your own custom wait methods
[16:57:09] Dude-X: or use the canned ExpectedConditions
[16:57:15] emaugust: nod OK
[16:59:28] Dude-X: i use thread.sleep when i am lazy to figure out a nice wait method to use
[16:59:36] Dude-X: or if the feature in devleopment is changing rapidly
[16:59:47] Dude-X: and the thing i am waiting on is no longer valid

[17:00:01] emaugust: I am very new to selenium - I wont lie
[17:00:04] emaugust: thread.sleep seems easier
[17:00:06] emaugust: than wait methods heh
[17:00:15] Dude-X: when you have hundreds of tests
[17:00:24] Spanktar has joined #selenium
[17:00:30] Dude-X: all those 1-4 second sleeps add up
[17:00:34] emaugust: nod
[17:00:44] emaugust: inefficient for sure
[17:00:57] emaugust: but so back to clicking a select drop down
[17:01:03] emaugust: what approach do you use?
[17:01:39] Dude-X: also keep in mind that 1-4 seconds is not 1-4 seconds Real Time, but 1-4 seconds computer clock time that it allocates for that process/thread. So in practice it's really 2-8 seconds… or more!
[17:01:55] Dude-X: the select class should work fine if it's a brain dead select
[17:02:04] Dude-X: but i wouldn't use it if you get errors
[17:02:11] emaugust: it is working for me
[17:02:16] emaugust: I just dislike that it needs 2 lines of code
[17:02:23] emaugust: where .sendkeys
[17:02:25] emaugust: requires 1
[17:02:30] emaugust: (but works inconsistently)
[17:02:51] Dude-X: don't most people mouse over the selection dropdown
[17:03:04] emaugust: I would imagine
[17:03:12] Dude-X: unless it's something like a state dropdown, then some people would click a letter
[17:03:25] emaugust: well it is a state drop down
[17:03:28] emaugust: but from a testing perspective
[17:03:38] emaugust: do we care whether we interact with the selectbox via simulated mouse
[17:03:39] emaugust: or keys?
[17:04:30] emaugust: the test is less about being able to mouse click the right select box value but rather, submitting the form with proper values selected... if that makes sense?
[17:04:43] Dude-X: sure
[17:04:54] Dude-X: you want to do things that are stable
[17:05:07] emaugust: that makes sense
[17:05:21] rpereir__ has joined #selenium
[17:05:33] Dude-X: what i have done is created a wrapper to the webdriver API
[17:05:49] Dude-X: so that my page objects don't call webdrive directly but rather the wrapper so that it does al the waiting builtin
[17:06:12] jimevans: emaugust: i'll jump in here just to mention that the "right" way to select an <option> element within a <select> element is to find the <option> element (using findElement) and call .click() on it.
[17:06:23] emaugust: thanks jim
[17:06:49] emaugust: I am taking an indian selenium course
[17:06:52] emaugust: and it is pretty good but
[17:07:28] emaugust: but then he teaches using sendkeys
[17:07:38] emaugust: to choose select box values
[17:07:39] Dude-X: i use click on dropdowns
[17:07:43] Dude-X: always
[17:07:55] Dude-X: click the dropdown, then click the value
[17:08:15] Dude-X: on some dropdowns that are super Javascripted, i have to click outside to activate it
[17:08:31] emaugust: hmmm
[17:09:36] emaugust: so how do you call out the click on the value in the drop down
[17:09:51] RossPatterson: Well, that's the way $DEITY intended <SELECT> to work, but in the wonderful world of RIA/AJAX, sendKeys() is a good idea too.  Case in point: When presented with a "what is your birth date" set of <SELECT>s, you can often type "09\t11\t1959" and it will work (if you're me :-) )
[17:10:07] RossPatterson: And, of course, that needs to be tested.
[17:10:31] Dude-X: hmm didn't think about testing tabing
[17:10:35] Dude-X: but that's a good idea
[17:11:01] emaugust: I open the select box with
[17:11:03] emaugust: "driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id='selState']")).click();"
[17:11:17] emaugust: then I want to select the value "GOA" from the drop down
[17:11:25] Dude-X: since it's an id, use By.id("selState")
[17:11:33] Dude-X: i have a friend from Goa
[17:11:37] Dude-X: now lives in the US
[17:11:49] emaugust: I bet they miss partying :p
[17:11:59] Dude-X: she's a bit conservative
[17:12:38] emaugust: ah
[17:12:46] emaugust: so wait help me finish
[17:12:49] emaugust: driver.findElement(By.id("selState")).
[17:12:54] emaugust: what do you call then?
[17:13:49] emaugust: the text of the item i want is "GOA"
[17:15:04] Dude-X: .click(), then do you driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(String.format("#selState option[value='%s']", state)).click()
[17:15:19] Dude-X: but it all depends on how the dropdown is coded
[17:15:30] Dude-X: you do use firebug or html inspector
[17:15:38] emaugust: firebug
[17:15:40] emaugust: and firepath
[17:15:56] Dude-X: great
[17:16:01] Dude-X: also get fireDiff
[17:16:13] emaugust: what is that
[17:16:14] Dude-X: it will help you find the element to wait on for really active widgets
[17:16:22] Dude-X: it shows all the changes to the DOM
[17:16:23] emaugust: ok cool
[17:17:20] emaugust: driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(String.format("#selState option[value='GOA']", state)).click();
[17:17:28] emaugust: should that state be selState?
[17:18:04] Dude-X: you want to have a generic function to handle any state
[17:18:10] Dude-X: state is a variable that could be passed on
[17:18:29] emaugust: this is a bit above my current understanding of selenium / java
[17:18:30] emaugust: i think
[17:18:40] Dude-X: do you know what is the Page Object design pattern?
[17:18:49] emaugust: no
[17:19:12] sixpindin: Hi, does webdriver automatically dismiss javascript 'confirm' prompts? - If so, does anybody know where this is set?
[17:20:36] Dude-X: no it does not. it will come soon though.
[17:20:48] Dude-X: or maybe it works for firefox only at the moment
[17:20:55] lukeis: it works for ff
[17:21:56] sixpindin: Ok, but when I've a script that runs fine until it hits a confirm box, then the confirm vanishes; so I'm trying to figure out why it's vaishing. It only vanishes when webdriver clicks the instigating button, but when I click it manually I get the box
[17:22:14] sassda has joined #selenium
[17:22:30] sixpindin: All this means that I can't get past the box because by the time I try to accept it (with webdriver native function) the box is gone
[17:23:05] emaugust: is something like this a clean way to use a select box with click - b.find_element_by_xpath("//select/option[@value='The Options I am Looking for']").click()
[17:24:14] lukeis: emaugust: that's the same thing that the Select support class does.... Select(b.find_element_by_tag_name("select")).select_by_value('The Option you are looking for')
[17:24:40] Dude-X: emaugust: yes, but if you want to be have good selenium tests, you create generic functions in page objects
[17:24:46] Dude-X: and then your tests call those functons

[17:31:44] lukeis: mmm... its its...
[17:32:04] Dude-X: sixpindin: my guess is you're doing two or more calls webdriver api calls?
[17:32:31] sixpindin: Ah, its is possessive. I'm an idiot. Serves me right for trying to be smart.
[17:32:44] sixpindin: dude-x : just one call
[17:32:49] sixpindin: Just clicking a button 
[17:32:55] sixpindin: and the button spawns a confirm
[17:32:59] Dude-X: do you dismiss or accept the alert?
[17:33:00] sixpindin: and the confirm vanishes
[17:33:08] Dude-X: oh
[17:33:14] sixpindin: I can't even access the alert because it vanishes
[17:33:15] Dude-X: no idea why that happens
[17:33:20] lukeis: do you actually see it pop up when running the automation?
[17:33:23] sixpindin: [facepalm]
[17:33:28] Dude-X: maybe you need to add a wait before clicking
[17:33:48] *lukeis takes it as they have figured it out
[17:34:11] Dude-X: or maybe there's some javascript handler like onclick() that's it's responding to?
[17:34:18] sixpindin: Yea, I see it pop-up and then it vanishes again. If I click the button (which spawns the pop-up) manually, then the alert stays.
[17:35:07] sixpindin: Yea, there's an onlclick which launches the alert, then if alert is accepted there's a postback
[17:36:00] sixpindin: I'm very shady when it comes to javascript, so there may be a way to just run the function that gets run when the alert is accepted. I've looked into that but to no avil, and it would be a workaround anyway.
[17:36:25] sixpindin: I'll keep looking into it. Mucho annoying.
[17:37:18] Dude-X: see if it works properly with native events enabled
[17:37:57] Dude-X: otherwise you'd have to use execute Javascript to set off the button which is kind of bad because the button may be broken in someway and that call may always succeed
[17:37:59] sixpindin: Ok, how do I enable these? - Or do you have a link to some documentation on them? - thanks!

[18:20:02] AutomatedTester: which needs typing tests
[18:20:06] jarib: jimevans: what are you up to?
[18:20:09] AutomatedTester: and I found a couple issues
[18:20:56] jimevans: jarib: playing with ghostdriver.
[18:21:13] jimevans: but i need the latest phantomjs, which means i'm building webkit. :)
[18:22:22] AutomatedTester: crazy fool
[18:22:59] *jarib wonders how much ghostdriver benefits from using phantomjs over qtwebkit directly
[18:25:18] lfryc has joined #selenium
[18:25:44] jimevans: well, phantomjs is a javascript api, so it's really easy to leverage the atoms to get a working webdriver implementation pretty quickly.
[18:26:41] jimevans: plus, it conforms to the "create a standalone server" pattern, so native language bindings without other runtimes is easily doable.
[18:27:51] *jimevans suspects jarib is thinking of capybara-webkit.
[18:28:18] jarib: i think we may have discussed this before :)
[18:28:20] jarib: but yeah
[18:29:46] AutomatedTester: bbl
[18:32:17] jimevans: i've looked at capybara-webkit, and i just don't get how to extract all of the capybara goo (which i don't give a damn about) out of it.
[18:34:52] sixpindin: dude-x : enabling native events did not work. Thanks for the idea anyway.
[18:40:08] jarib: jimevans: yeah, i'm just thinking that injecting some javascript in QtWebKit directly can't be that hard. no need for these intermediate layers
[18:40:42] jarib: though i guess that's what the capybara-webkit and phantomjs people were thinking too, everyone wants to be *the* intermediate layer ;)

[18:42:23] jarib: hehe
[18:42:46] jarib: don't wait up for it

[18:44:13] jarib: yeah, it's in cpp/webdriver-server :)

[19:19:36] titus98: Hello. I'm having an issue with Firefox/MacOS where in order to get my tests to pass, sometimes the browser needs to be the focused window in the OS, and other times it can't be the focused window. Is this a firefox driver issue?
[19:19:36] stephend has joined #selenium
[19:20:14] Dude-X: titus98: do you have native events enabled?
[19:20:22] titus98: No :)
[19:20:33] titus98: Even with it enabled, though, it doesn't work on MacOS
[19:20:37] Dude-X: then perhaps it's an issue :/
[19:20:38] titus98: (it does on windows)
[19:20:50] titus98: native events enabled slows our tests to a crawl
[19:21:03] titus98: significantly slower on windows
[19:21:05] Dude-X: yeah same here, it's a 50-100% penalty
[19:21:38] titus98: My recommendation was to toggle native events on/off depending on test, but it seems like it shouldn't rely on native events to work
[19:21:58] Dude-X: it would if it has things like CSS hover
[19:22:08] Dude-X: otherwise you'd need javascript to make things happen
[19:22:56] titus98: We have a fancy implementation for drop down menus that uses javascript, which is the issue
[19:24:05] titus98: using an execute script doesn't seem like the right solution either
[19:24:16] Dude-X: you can use execute script to wait for a condition
[19:24:19] Dude-X: then you can click
[19:24:22] adamgoucher: if its your own fanciness, get things like $element.open_menu('top level').open_sub_menu('one down').open_sub_menu('two down')
[19:24:33] adamgoucher: added to the fancy
[19:25:37] titus98: unfortunately, it is too fancy. We have a select/option and a ul/li, clicking the element makes the li visible, not the option. There is some js that changes the class for which option is selected, and passes that into the select/option
[19:25:49] titus98: (I think)
[19:26:17] titus98: I can't get it to work in any fashion on MacOS, native events or not
[19:27:44] titus98: I guess I'm curious if this might be some kind of 'bug' in firefox, or if all bets are off when it comes to funky js implementations, or if getting native events working better is the long-term solution for the devs...
[19:27:44] Dude-X: i have code that works with a fancy widget like that using just a good ol try/catch and repeating the interaction at most twice
[19:27:58] titus98: I'm not getting an exception, just nothing happens
[19:28:02] Dude-X: oh
[19:28:06] Dude-X: that's just worse
[19:28:10] titus98: :)
[19:28:22] titus98: I can open the menu, but clicking the li tag doesn't work
[19:28:39] Dude-X: then you'd have to cheat with exceute script on the mac
[19:28:42] titus98: and the select/option code never becomes visible, so I can't use Select
[19:28:50] rpereir__ has joined #selenium
[19:28:57] Dude-X: select is only good for simple dropdowns
[19:29:04] titus98: right
[19:29:43] titus98: for some reason the UI team doesn't listen to me when I ask them to re-implement everything with select/option to make my automated tests work better :)

[19:48:26] simonstewart: 'sup?
[19:49:35] AutomatedTester: do you know if I extract the sendKeys atom for Firefox, will it pull the PUA conversion code too?
[19:49:55] *AutomatedTester can't see it in the extracted code but thought to ask before I go diving
[19:50:08] simonstewart: Hmmm...
[19:50:27] simonstewart: moving the Firefox driver's sendKeys to use the atomized version has been on my list for a while
[19:50:39] simonstewart: It's not entirely there yet.
[19:50:44] AutomatedTester: right...
[19:51:03] jimevans: can someone explain to me what the hell is the root cause of #4310?

[19:51:15] simonstewart: If you're yanking the code from the firefox driver, it may be better to get the firefox driver using the atom's sendKeys function
[19:52:40] simonstewart: I think the main thing we need to worry about is the PUA conversion and calling down to DOMWindowUtils where possible
[19:52:43] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: I used ./go //javascript/webdriver/atoms:type:firefox 
[19:52:49] simonstewart: (I think that those are the major differences)
[19:53:04] simonstewart: Yeah, but that's _just_ JS.
[19:53:15] simonstewart: The typing tests from the java project are more demanding
[19:54:23] jimevans: i'm pretty sure the sendkeys atom doesn't handle all the corner cases of keyboard navigation in a browser-independent way.
[19:55:00] jimevans: (much as i wish it were otherwise, and much as i wish i had the time/ability to make it otherwise)

[21:56:53] Dude-X: actually, i was curious about another project at work, and I looked at their webdriver infrastructure code

[22:25:28] AutomatedTester: jimevans: you dont need to build it
[22:25:39] AutomatedTester: you can download it
[22:25:54] jimevans: in a debug build, non-stable-channel build?
[22:26:07] AutomatedTester: yea

[22:26:35] Dude-X: since july 25
[22:26:35] AutomatedTester: but the good stuff is in nightly
[22:26:41] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: since before that

[22:26:55] AutomatedTester: yea
[22:26:56] Dude-X: where it's built in

[22:29:31] AutomatedTester: Mozilla Central is where all code lands
[22:30:00] Dude-X: currently what does marionette lack that exists in webdriver, and vice versa
[22:30:20] AutomatedTester: key items are alert handling
[22:30:36] *AutomatedTester actually cant remember
[22:30:48] Dude-X: can you still take snapshots
[22:31:00] AutomatedTester: screenshots isnt in there
[22:31:02] AutomatedTester: yet
[22:31:33] Dude-X: can you execute arbitrary javascript and async javascript/
[22:32:32] AutomatedTester: that has been in there from day 1
[22:32:39] AutomatedTester: thats key to testing Firefox OS
[22:32:48] AutomatedTester: we also need to add native events
[22:33:10] Dude-X: what about CSS elements like :hover
[22:33:21] AutomatedTester: what about them?
[22:33:41] Dude-X: well i guess native events could take care of that
[22:33:57] Dude-X: interacting with elements that are activated by pseudo CSS selectors
[22:34:23] barancev: they're not in the DOM, is it really possible to interact with them?
[22:34:42] Dude-X: marionette is hooked into firefox though
[22:35:13] *AutomatedTester will ask people to beta test it before we unleash it on the world
[22:35:59] Dude-X: If java bindings are created for it that adhere to most of the webdriver stuff I can test it on my project
[22:37:45] barancev: Dude-X: oh, sorry, I've mixed pseudo-selectors with pseudo-elements
[22:38:03] Dude-X: what's a pseudo element?
[22:38:26] barancev: e.g. ::before

[23:39:56] sixpindin: strange question, sorry if it's random, I'm doing something else and have IRC open on another screen and there may be some programmers on here
[23:40:17] AutomatedTester: that is strange for a question
[23:40:24] AutomatedTester: it doesnt even have a question in it
[23:40:25] AutomatedTester: :P
[23:40:46] sixpindin: I'm putting together a few data-structures to hold statistics and I realised that I'm going to have loads of statistic group types...
[23:41:23] sixpindin: So I started to put them in a simple enum (To make searching, other opertaions consistant-er)
[23:41:56] sixpindin: Then I realised that loads of these categories are children of other categories, so I want to represent this in a node-like structure
[23:42:08] sixpindin: but I'm a noob programmer and can't decide what to use
[23:42:53] sixpindin: An XML-node structure but without custom types ... many interfaces?
[23:43:11] sixpindin: appologies if non of that makes sense. It's likily my ignorance.
[23:44:01] AutomatedTester: sixpindin: 
[23:44:02] sixpindin: OR could I just define IcategoryNode and ICategoryNodeChild
[23:44:13] AutomatedTester: sixpindin: you want enums that have children?
[23:44:15] sixpindin: listening
[23:45:19] sixpindin: Yea, that kind of thing, there's an idea starting to form in my head, but just incase you've any idea on what I should consider
[23:45:32] sixpindin: or what kind of bad design led me to even require this

[23:48:51] AutomatedTester: sixpindin: my advice is dont over engineer
[23:49:00] AutomatedTester: think of what you need build that
[23:49:22] AutomatedTester: and then tweak/throwaway and restat until you have what you want
[23:51:01] sixpindin: You're totally right. I need to keep reminding myself of that. I've got some ideas here anyway, just from a change of mental scenery (on here)
[23:59:05] sixpindin: + just thinking...'enums with children' is exactly what I wanted, and xml looks to be just that...just an enum<node> (root) with more enum<node>s it, etc, I think. Anyway, cheers again
