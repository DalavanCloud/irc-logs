[01:05:17] defaultro: hey folks, I'm not sure how to create a test case for this situation. When I right click on the webpage, our app prevents the menu to get displayed. Is it possible?
[01:07:05] defaultro: the webpage is heavily driven by javascript
[01:18:39] defaultro: can Selenium IDE run scripts? RIght now, the only thing I know in Selenium IDE is saving it as test case in html extension.

[14:25:20] adamgoucher: quit doesnt return anything
[14:25:53] adamgoucher: (which is DELETE /session/:id/window)
[14:26:46] detronizator: adamgoucher: AutomatedTester: ok, that I know. What I don't know is if I have to assigned the role of "new current window" to another window (if it's available in the session) or leave it to the user to do the switch
[14:27:03] detronizator: the JSON Wire Protocol doesn't mention anything about this nifty case
[14:27:12] adamgoucher: i dont even see POST /session/:id/window_handle in the protocol
[14:27:32] AutomatedTester: detronizator: the Delete just leave the user to switch back
[14:28:02] AutomatedTester: detronizator: that is what i am assuming for Marionette
[14:28:19] detronizator: adamgoucher: sorry, I meant "GET"
[14:28:33] detronizator: AutomatedTester: so, in other words, after a window is deleted by the user
[14:28:53] detronizator: if she tries to send any other command, the driver will fail?
[14:28:54] AutomatedTester: detronizator: for GET, return a list of window_handles
[14:29:07] detronizator: AutomatedTester: yep, I know that
[14:29:12] AutomatedTester: detronizator: if the user tries to send something to a window it should fail
[14:29:35] AutomatedTester: if a user does get window handles it should return a list of handles
[14:29:46] AutomatedTester: and switch_to_window should work to
[14:29:57] detronizator: AutomatedTester: of course, that's obvious
[14:30:13] detronizator: AutomatedTester: my wonder was about "should I switch to any of the other windows, if I have some"
[14:30:20] detronizator: or "should I leave to the user to do the switch"
[14:30:32] AutomatedTester: detronizator: no because you will likely go to the one the user doesnt want to go to
[14:30:40] AutomatedTester: leave it to the user
[14:30:43] adamgoucher: leave the user to switch
[14:30:54] detronizator: AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: coolio - that's settles it
[14:30:55] detronizator: :)
[14:31:12] adamgoucher: heh. we didnt even coordinate that in the backchannel
[14:31:44] detronizator: adamgoucher: so you all just assumed "if the user does something stupid like deleting a windows and than keep sending commands to it, screw her/him"?
[14:31:46] detronizator: :)
[14:32:04] AutomatedTester: detronizator: its the same as in real life
[14:32:11] detronizator: AutomatedTester: lol - very true
[14:32:13] adamgoucher: well, wouldnt spin it that way … but ...
[14:32:16] AutomatedTester: if a user closes a window and then tries to use it they are going to have a really bad time
[14:32:31] detronizator: AutomatedTester: I see the "perspective", yes
[14:32:46] AutomatedTester: detronizator: we are making a framework for emulating the user
[14:32:57] adamgoucher: making a library :P
[14:33:01] detronizator: AutomatedTester: yes. that makes absolute sense.
[14:33:38] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: next you will tell me a selenium script is a check not a test

[15:46:29] jimevans: could be a memory leak in IE itself.
[15:46:46] jimevans: could be something the IE driver is doing that's causing the memory to run out of control
[15:47:01] AutomatedTester: could be the JS on the page leaking memory

[15:53:42] Dude-X: because 6 didn't come out?

[15:54:07] Dude-X: has it always been the same release schedule?
[15:54:33] Dude-X: jimevans: i wouldn't think so because many iphone/ipad users use itunes which relies on safari on the back end (but not the safari executable)
[15:54:40] jimevans: i don't know, honestly. i've not kept up with apple's releases. 
[15:54:57] Dude-X: my impression is that itunes upgrades have been the same
[15:55:16] jimevans: yeah, but iTunes can ship webkit all day with apple never releasing another safari version for windows.

[16:02:31] sti: just noticed: IEserver of 32 bit version is much faster than 64; 
[16:03:28] Dude-X: sti, IE9 is has an optimised javascript engine
[16:03:34] Dude-X: but only for 32bit IE
[16:03:52] sti: haha .. thanks
[16:04:39] Dude-X: actually it has a JIT for JS, which doesn't exist for the 64 bit version
[16:08:34] sti: a thing is that if you run a lot of tests in IE , first will run quickly, more or less, but the last ones, since IE would eat 2+ GB of ram, will be very slowly 
[16:08:58] Dude-X: good to know. pretty soon i'll have to implement support for IE
[16:09:09] Dude-X: which means i have to convert a lot of xpaths to css selectors
[16:10:36] sti: but what would be your advice here ? restart IE for each test? 
[16:11:15] AutomatedTester: sti: restart the browser between functional areas
[16:12:31] sti: ok , I'll try it , thanks

[17:24:53] andreastt: Special keys (from Keys) aren't working, window management is … lacking, the preference handling is slow and input (mouse and keyboard) are fairly slow.

[17:26:34] Dude-X: andreastt: would you say the opera inspector is better than IE's or Chromes?
[17:26:58] andreastt: Dude-X: I don't do a lot of web development, but it does have some very nice features.
[17:27:09] andreastt: (Never tried IE's FWIW.)
[17:27:50] andreastt: Dude-X: The cool thing is that OperaDriver uses the exact same protocol as Opera's inspector to communicate with Opera, though.
[17:28:05] jimevans: IE's is passable, but not nearly as nice as Chrome's. i use the developer tools primarily for the javascript console in IE.
[17:28:19] andreastt: Same here.
[17:28:26] andreastt: well, for Opera that is.
[17:28:32] andreastt: But I don't do web development.

[17:30:03] jleyba: Just shows IE does have a console and can generate stack traces for JS errors, but MS insists on not giving you access to that in JS

[20:45:31] *RossPatterson is getting kind of jaded.
[20:46:44] jimevans: RossPatterson: i hear you, but here's the thing. i follow the continuing drama of issue #141.

[20:48:29] jimevans: while there are a bunch of "but i want a pony" responses there, there are also several articulate and full-throated defenses of the position that it should be included.
[20:48:30] jimevans: i have to believe that at least some of those which are the most articulate aren't of the variety of user you describe.
[20:49:25] RossPatterson: Indeed there are.
[20:49:58] RossPatterson: Users like that are awesome.
[20:49:59] RossPatterson: But some still like ponies.
[20:51:59] jimevans: and yet, one says, "you can't have a pony, but here's something that's kinda like a pony, and meets the same need for you that a pony would", and the response of, "but i still want a pony" is puzzling, particularly from those who *are* of the (seemingly) articulate and rational variety.
[20:52:58] Swadq has joined #selenium
[20:53:18] jarib: llaskin: yeah
[20:53:21] RossPatterson: I think some of the problem is that the users who can intelligently discuss the topic are also the sort that don't necessarily accept another's rationalizations or analogies.  As a former VP/Engineering, I both loved and hated having those folks on my team.
[20:56:22] RossPatterson: Once the discussion goes all "let me show you how large my <architectural talen> is", nothing much is gonna happen.  But such folks are often swayed by a "I'm the architect and I say it doesn't fit" opinion from someone like Simon or you, but only after they've said their piece.
[20:56:42] RossPatterson: Managing good geeks makes herding cats look easy.
[20:58:26] RossPatterson: Then there's always the "Name that tune!" response: "This is Open Source, feel free to write a patch and share it with others, even if the project disagrees with you."
