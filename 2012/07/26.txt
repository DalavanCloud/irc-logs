[15:34:46] dawagner: From the things we've said on the bug, it's not clear to a casual reader whether, if someone came up with a nice API which could be implemented cross-browser, and sent us a patch, we'd be happy to accept it.
[15:36:23] jimevans: dawagner: sounds like you're talking about #141?

[15:36:29] *jimevans is late to the conversation
[15:37:32] dawagner: Yep
[15:37:37] jimevans: whoa. somebody changed the javascript crazy-fun bits. now it's throwing warnings.
[15:37:51] jimevans: dawagner: i just blogged about that.
[15:38:00] dawagner: I read :) It was interesting and well written
[15:38:26] jimevans: wow. thanks. high praise. i'm genuinely appreciative.
[15:38:27] *AutomatedTester wonders if dawagner read his latest post
[15:38:34] AutomatedTester: jimevans: it was a good read
[15:38:39] AutomatedTester: I even tweeted about it
[15:39:27] jimevans: i'd aspire to be the raymond chen of the selenium project in my blogging, if i had half his talent and brains.
[15:40:03] jimevans: just from the "here's the history why things are the way they are" posts.

[16:55:39] lawcab: good morning
[16:55:47] lawcab: I have a question
[16:55:56] jimevans: lawcab: go ahead
[16:56:12] lawcab: i have 2 elements  <input style="visibility:hidden;position:absolute" data-role="nojs" data-mini="true" class="button" type="submit" name="_eventId~verify" value="Check Bet" /> and  <input data-mini="true" class="button" type="submit" name="_eventId~verify" value="Check Bet" />
[16:56:19] NeptuNooo has left #selenium
[16:56:42] lawcab: my xpath is //input[contains(@name,'_eventId~verify')]
[16:57:12] lawcab: so if i do a click it will say Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with
[16:57:21] lawcab: cause i think it gets the first one
[16:57:27] jimevans: sounds about right. the first one is being returned.
[16:57:44] lawcab: how can i get the second one?
[16:57:50] lawcab: not that good with xpath
[16:57:50] jimevans: there are a couple of ways.
[16:58:09] jimevans: first, i wouldn't use xpath in this situation anyway, but that's beside the point.
[16:58:23] lawcab: what would you suggest?
[16:59:06] jimevans: i'd use findElements(By.name("_eventId~verify")) and loop through the returned collection until I found one that returned true from .isDisplayed().

[19:02:28] eranm: jimevans, aye
[19:02:29] lukeis: i won't push for a release, since there is an easy work-around... to just depend on the server artifact instead
[19:02:43] jimevans: so the interactions tests are failing on IE9.
[19:03:12] jimevans: and the problem is when the mouse pointer is within the physical window.
[19:05:00] sfbrian has joined #selenium
[19:05:01] eranm: jimevans, have they started failing since my change?
[19:05:25] jimevans: i can see what the problem is, and it looks like it ends up doing the right thing, but the events we're asserting against doesn't match up.
[19:05:43] jimevans: due to the mouse pointer behavior, we see far too many DragOuts reported.
[19:05:54] jimevans: more than we're expecting anyway.
[19:06:22] jimevans: eranm: your change was a good one. it looks like it gives us the "right" end result, but the tests are failing.
[19:10:26] eranm: jimevans, I see. I think I fixed some of the tests to take it into account we get more mouse move events
[19:10:38] eranm: Could you email me with specific tests and failures? I could have a look tomorrow
[19:10:59] jimevans: you can check the ci server.

[19:11:13] jimevans: for the IE 9 tests, the two failures are there.
[19:11:43] jimevans: i can hack the equivalent .NET tests to work by matching a regex instead of an exact match.
