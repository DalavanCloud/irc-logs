[12:30:13] simonstewart: Is the "overflow" property of the BODY element "hidden"?
[12:30:23] simonstewart: And of the HTML element "scroll" or "auto"?
[12:30:43] adaptive: I getting the following error when I run a test on ie9:
[12:30:43] adaptive: ElementNotVisibleException: Message: u'The point at which the driver is attempting to click on the element was not scrolled into the viewport.
[12:30:43] adaptive: The same code works correctly and without problems on chrome and firefox. It seems to be only on ie9 that the element is outside the viewport. I tried using javascript to scroll to the element:
[12:30:43] adaptive: self.driver.execute_script("window.scrollBy(0,-200)", "");
[12:30:43] adaptive: and
[12:30:44] adaptive: element=self.driver.find_element_by_xpath(xpath)
[12:30:44] adaptive: self.driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0,%d);" % int(element.location["y"]), "")
[12:30:45] adaptive: but neither solves the problem. It happens every time for me on ie9 (the browser I have to support).
[12:30:45] adaptive: Is there a way to change the viewport. The element is present and is_displayed() returns True.

[12:31:49] adaptive: this happens every time for me on ie9 but as I said chrome and firefox are fine

[15:40:42] AutomatedTester: also what is this types he talks about/
[15:41:17] jimevans: AutomatedTester: it looks like there's something going on with the python bindings there where the json they create contains a number instead of a string for the value member of the findElements command
[15:41:18] hourback has joined #selenium
[15:41:54] jimevans: in the wire protocol wiki page, it specifies the data type of each property of the json object.
[15:42:14] jimevans: i'm going strictly by the bug report here; i've not actually examined it.
[15:42:37] jimevans: but the logs attached to the bug do show json requests that have an unexpected structure.

[15:43:42] AutomatedTester: I found one place that says a number
[15:43:45] _gates: I ask in here because thats what selenium seems to be but with only 1 IP i feel ill get black listed before anything else
[15:44:49] jimevans: AutomatedTester: really? i've not seen anything that says "number". i'm looking at http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/element under the "JSON Parameters" section

[15:46:57] AutomatedTester: I forget the scenario
[15:47:18] AutomatedTester: but I remember its because there are a lot of bad things happening on the webserver
[15:48:03] davehunt: benadderson: it deals with untrusted, but if it's invalid and trusted you may get issues
[15:48:38] davehunt: we had to set it to assume trusted to get around an issue where untrusted and invalid conflict

[21:45:42] jimevans: barancev: it's pretty straightforward. it didn't find the dialog. and specifically what it's looking for is a window with a window class of "#32770" or "Internet Explorer_TridentDlgFrame", having the window style WS_VISIBLE bit set and the WS_DISABLED bit unset, and has a process ID of the current iexplore.exe process as returned by GetWindowThreadProcessId.

[21:45:49] barancev: I think I've found the cause -- a while loop without sleep and with 10 attempts only
[21:47:03] jimevans: i believe the EnumWindows call will implicitly free the processor, but i could be wrong.
[21:47:39] barancev: jimevans: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/cpp/IEDriver/CommandHandlers/SendKeysCommandHandler.h#194
[21:47:56] jimevans: i know exactly where you're talking about. i'm looking at the code right now.
[21:48:26] jimevans: like i said, there's an EnumWindows() call there, which I believe implicitly frees the processor.
[21:48:28] barancev: sorry, I've no MSVS on my home PC to check right now my guess
[21:49:28] barancev: but I'd add a short sleep anyway to make sure it waits long enough
[21:49:55] jimevans: at this point we've already hard-coded a wait for 0.1 seconds (line 177), and we've most likely waited for another full second after that (line 183).
[21:50:17] jimevans: s/most likely/also/
[21:51:03] jimevans: how long do you want to wait? 
[21:51:59] jimevans: i'd look more to see if the logic is wrong in BrowserFactory::FindDialogWindowForProcess() (BrowserFactory.cpp, line 354)
[21:53:49] barancev: I'll make several experiments tomorrow, but 1 sec is not enough, it opens a directory with lots of files and it takes time
[21:55:14] barancev: yes, previous message in the log is about 1,1 sec before
[21:56:36] lukeis has joined #selenium
[21:57:21] barancev: so it runs all 10 iterations almost instantly, loop is useless without a sleep inside

[22:11:48] Zack: it's different through each test. Is this a timing issue?
[22:30:57] Swadq: Has the page fully loaded, Zack ?
[22:31:29] Zack: yup. I have a wait to ensure each page loads before it continues through the loop
[22:31:58] Zack: it's random for each print.  Sometimes it will print the title other times it will be blank.  Happens to around 2-4 links per test
