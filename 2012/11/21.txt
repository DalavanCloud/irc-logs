[14:36:17] dawagner: Error, in both cases
[14:36:18] AutomatedTester: so its unknown to me
[14:36:32] dawagner: Manipulating on an unknown element should always be an error

[15:23:11] jimevans: adamgoucher: should be pretty easy.
[15:23:49] adamgoucher: ya. i suspect its just a capabilities addition and some documentation
[15:24:13] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: the python code has already been updated for it
[15:24:22] jimevans: as has .NET.
[15:24:54] adamgoucher: for both webdriver /and/ remote webdriver?
[15:24:55] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[15:25:27] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[15:25:42] jimevans: there shouldn't be anything you need to do for remotewebdriver. ghostdriver speaks raw json wire protocol :)
[15:25:52] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[15:26:37] adamgoucher: so on a remote node i need both the se server and ghostdriver server and connect to the appropriate one depending on users' requested browser?
[15:27:18] adamgoucher: or do i start the server with -Dwebdriver.ghostdriver.server=
[15:27:18] adamgoucher: l
[15:27:45] jimevans: at the moment, until the ghostdriver .jar is incorporated into the java bindings, i'd assume that's the case, but it's just a matter of what url you use in the remote constructor.
[15:28:14] jimevans: there's still a TODO item to incorporate the ghostdriver bits into the java bindings (which will get them into the remote se server)
[15:28:15] adamgoucher: its less about the bindings and mroe about the server
[15:31:22] adamgoucher: was an 'official' mechanism created for including future browser drivers into the server figured out? i hate to say the word 'plugin' but having to add 3 classes to the server for each one seems clunky. (he says not being java-skilled enough to actually /do/ this)
[15:34:24] jimevans: adamgoucher: no "official" mechanism has been created. that's a discussion that ivan, simon, and myself were going to hash out w.r.t. ghostdriver. the current proposed mechanism is "create a .jar containing your java bindings, and we'll check that into third_party". this is what opera currently does.
[15:37:40] adamgoucher: why is there server stuff under java/client? <boggle>
[15:38:07] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: like what?
[15:38:26] AutomatedTester: I dont know the java code intimately but havent noticed stuff like that before
[15:38:33] adamgoucher: like all the remote webdriver interact with browser binary stuffs
[15:39:01] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: the server stuff delegates down to client stuff
[15:39:29] adamgoucher: sigh, ya, still hurts ones brain to crawl through the structure
[15:39:33] jimevans: *every* client has to know how to interact with browser binaries, if it wants to provide browser-specific driver bindings.
[15:39:49] jimevans: java's a special case, because it also provides a remote server.
[15:40:24] *jimevans really ought to update the strontium sources.
[15:40:47] adamgoucher: so how does opera work (and i crawl code) -- i dont see an opera folder in there
[15:40:54] *AutomatedTester pushes marionette screenshot to the try server
[15:41:03] jimevans: it's in third_party.
[15:41:18] andreastt: The OperaDriver is a third party dependency.
[15:41:20] jimevans: it gets folded into the webdriver .jar, so it's in the class path.
[15:41:23] andreastt: Since Opera maintains it.
[15:42:25] adamgoucher: ahhhh. the 'in webdriver.jar' is the bit i was missing.
[15:42:52] jimevans: adamgoucher: the magic zaniness of crazy-fun!
[15:43:14] vectorshelve has joined #selenium
[15:43:33] adamgoucher: so more dumb questions … should not chromedriver and ieserver also be done that way?
[15:43:43] vectorshelve: Can Selenium be used for automation on Mobile device browser compatibility testing here? Can they be tested using Simulators/emulators or need handheld devices? Please share some thoughts on the test approach one can use here.
[15:44:44] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: no
[15:44:46] jimevans: adamgoucher: iedriverserver, like the firefox extension, is built by selenium, so no, in that case.
[15:44:50] AutomatedTester: since they are executables
[15:45:00] AutomatedTester: and that will set off anti-virus warnings
[15:45:19] jimevans: oh, you meant "why not zip them up into the .jar". got it.
[15:45:53] AutomatedTester: vectorshelve: should work on both devices and emulators
[15:45:57] AutomatedTester: if we support it
[15:46:10] AutomatedTester: jimevans: thats the way I read the question
[15:46:25] vectorshelve: AutomatedTester: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverForMobileBrowsers I found this link
[15:46:42] jimevans: AutomatedTester: and your answer is absolutely right, if that's the question being asked. :)
[15:46:50] adamgoucher: the thought pattern is more 'why not have all browser drivers behave the same way regardless of origin'
[15:47:46] jimevans: adamgoucher: i don't follow.
[15:49:00] adamgoucher: if/when more browsers get added, it seems there are multiple ways for them to be included. it would be nice to have one consistent way. preferably that does not mean people have to wait for someone with java skillz to make it available in the server
[15:49:32] adamgoucher: i'm just thinking through my confusion aloud :)
[15:49:43] jimevans: adamgoucher: that's why i prefer language bindings that provide browser-specific implementations. :)
[15:50:26] jleyba has joined #selenium
[15:50:27] selbot2: jleyba: note from dawagner about 1 hour ago: any reason not to get rid of the safari and safari-extension branches? 
[15:50:36] adamgoucher: but that, i think, doesnt solve the remote-webdriver situation
[15:50:36] jimevans: if you're only going to rely on the java remote webdriver server for all browser implementations, you're going to be stuck waiting for a java implementation to be incorporated into the server. 
[15:51:00] jimevans: no, it doesn't, you're right.
[15:51:07] jleyba: dawagner: no?  i did all my SafariDriver development in trunk
[15:51:32] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: a good example of just waiting for java is that python will be long done before I move onto doing the Java implementation
[15:51:37] adamgoucher: unless, to circle back, the answer for browser drivers is they need to /also/ listen as a separate port/standalone server and have the remote clients connect there instead of the remote server. but then you have a grid-ing problem
[15:52:03] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: browser vendors will offer a shim
[15:52:12] AutomatedTester: the grid is part of the OSS project
[15:52:30] AutomatedTester: we can help but tbh it shouldnt matter since the grid should just speak to the shim
[15:53:34] adamgoucher: so the right-ish-er answer is 'if you are developing a browser server/shim/thing you need to also add it to the java client before unleashing it upon the world' ?
[15:54:10] AutomatedTester: no
[15:54:49] AutomatedTester: think of AndroidDriver which has its only server built in
[15:55:07] AutomatedTester: when the grid sees it, it needs to just forward it down the pipe to the phone
[15:55:16] AutomatedTester: and then the phone does what not and sends it back
[15:55:38] AutomatedTester: we can't demand that browser vendors implement things in the Java code
[15:57:10] freynaud: what would help for grid
[15:57:25] freynaud: would be to have a better /status command
[15:57:27] adamgoucher: but if they don't, then its not available through the remote webdriver /as provided by the downloadable se server/, correct? it means that your remote webdriver command executor needs to be pointed at their server
[15:57:51] freynaud: if that was returning the real capabilities of the server / browser, it could be used for configuration
[15:57:55] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: yes and the shim is a remote command executor
[15:57:59] freynaud: rather than defaulting to the default node
[15:58:06] jleyba: freynaud: we can change /status

[15:59:08] freynaud: jleyba: if /status had a consistent browser / version / platform
[15:59:32] freynaud: then a call to it would be enough to describe the node. Then a ping to it returning 200 would mean "node is still up"
[15:59:41] adamgoucher: AutomatedTester: so its more a case then of which 'style' of shim they provide (exe vs jar vs dll vs other) that determines how it gets distributed, but in all cases it needs the java client updated in order to access?

[16:00:40] jimevans: adamgoucher: if you're using the java implementation of the remote webdriver (nee selenium) server, yes.
[16:01:13] adamgoucher: right. /me goes to write this up somewhere for when he forgets it all next week and makes you explain it again :P
[16:01:51] jimevans: this is where i point out that the java remote webdriver server implementation provided by the selenium project is not the only implementation available. :)
[16:05:34] adamgoucher: this is where i point out that if i can barely understand this all, and i [think i] know more about how things are stuctured than the average user then how is the average user supposed to understand all the moving parts?
[16:06:02] *adamgoucher waits for that easy pitch to get knocked out of the part in 3 .. 2 .. 1 ..
[16:06:53] jleyba: adamgoucher: average user doesn't need to worry about it
[16:07:16] jleyba: They use our libraries.  We handle communication with the various driver implementations
[16:07:45] jleyba: Biggest hurdle for a user is they'll probably have to download browser-specific bits independently of the java/python/whatever language bindings
[16:08:18] jimevans: and there's a drive to deep left center field! murphy at the track, at the wall, looks up and it is… gone!

[16:09:21] *jimevans had a secret wish to be a baseball play-by-play guy once upon a time
[16:09:30] adamgoucher: …and there is a soapbox somewhere over there about the differences between the official bindings too...
[16:09:41] *adamgoucher goes back to writing about shims
[16:10:06] jleyba: Differences are b/c we try to do the idiomatic thing for each language instead of straight API clone
[16:10:41] jimevans: adamgoucher: what differences are you referring to? as jleyba mentions, there are idiomatic differences that are on purpose. are you seeing implementation gaps that shouldn't be there?
[16:11:43] adamgoucher: idiomatic is fine, but thing like support/* are different. (and no, i dont buy the argument that support/* is the playground of the individual bindings maintainers) (and yes, i understand its volunteer, etc.)

[IRC logfile - Started Wed Nov 21 17:00:11 2012]
[17:00:11] jleyba: conceptually, it's all the same now (except for dirty dirty htmlunit)
[17:00:43] jleyba: the language bindings talk to a "remote" WebDriver server.  That server may be a different process on the same machine, or it could be another machine
[17:00:54] jleyba: But it's still using HTTP
[17:01:08] adamgoucher: how would we distinguish with users between 'using the serve'r and 'not' ?
[17:01:19] jimevans: jleyba: that may not always be the case (using HTTP).

[20:22:29] detronizator: AutomatedTester: -_-' - so, you blaming GitHub randmly now?
[20:22:49] detronizator: isn't that exactly like me, blaming Google Code for being so '90es?
[20:23:05] detronizator: '90s* (I think without the 'e' works better)
[20:23:06] AutomatedTester: lol
[20:23:19] AutomatedTester: or getting a MBP with only 8GB RAM
[20:23:43] detronizator: I don't even remember where/when this 8GB thing started
[20:24:23] AutomatedTester: detronizator: from twitter
[20:24:31] AutomatedTester: you told us all about your new machine
[20:24:34] detronizator: AutomatedTester: it's the kind of stuff will continue until we forget the real reason and become "urban legend"
[20:24:52] *AutomatedTester remembers exactly where it came from
[20:24:53] detronizator: AutomatedTester: I know that, but was it me "exagerating" that I can "only" get 8GB?
[20:25:16] AutomatedTester: well the new MBP can't be upgraded
[20:25:33] detronizator: plightbo: btw, every time I switch from LimeChat to the Twitter client, my eyes vomit. AKA I hear you.
[20:26:02] plightbo: AutomatedTester: doing great. all settled, unpacked the last boxes a few weeks ago. couldn't be happier!
[20:26:04] detronizator: AutomatedTester: I know. It sucks but I understand the "engineering" reason.
[20:26:09] adamgoucher: mmmm. vomitting eyes. yup, i needed that image
[20:26:56] plightbo: vomit eyes => probably should see a doctor
[20:27:07] detronizator: adamgoucher: perfect image for enjoying the rest of the day, thinking of the horror movie where vomit comes out from the orbits (gross)

[20:28:18] detronizator: I need to find an alternative twitter client for mac. The official one on this screen is really shit. It has issues even with the pop-up positioning.
[20:28:45] adamgoucher: i suspect when your eyes are vomitting its past when you need to see a doctor
[20:28:57] detronizator: a friend suggested tweetdeck, but it's like installing WebSphere to host a static blog
[20:29:29] adamgoucher: tweetdeck is useful if you have multiple accounts, ongoing searches w/ filters etc.
[20:29:57] plightbo: detronizator: I hear good things about TweetBot but $20 for a Twitter client is a bit silly. Maybe just use the website?
[20:30:36] detronizator: plightbo: yes - spending money to write my rants or read others is just plain silly.
[20:30:37] plightbo: adamgoucher: haha, you're a dick (just saw your email)

[20:31:41] AutomatedTester: you can't seem to edit a gist on the github site
[20:32:11] adamgoucher: AutomatedTester: if its ish on the right path, pull it over to the wiki (sicne more than just me likely need to grok this)
[20:32:15] plightbo: I dunno, I think we just need a thread titled "What is Selenium?"
[20:32:27] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: its not
[20:32:37] FalCone: save_screenshot is giving me, like. Really tall images that have black space 
[20:32:41] plightbo: OK, well now that I jumped on and shook my fist at adamgoucher, I gotta run. It's been fun, be back soon! :)

[20:41:35] santiycr: loving the builder discussion
[20:44:19] AutomatedTester: santiycr: s/discussion/fight/
[20:44:31] santiycr: really?
[20:44:54] AutomatedTester: maybe I am reading into it
[20:45:43] adamgoucher: its not a fight really. i fully expect it to get in because hugs proposed it… a fight implies that there is another option. i just think its bringing a much larger issue back into focus (which will be ignored…)
[20:46:19] santiycr: I love the fact that discussions like this can happen
[20:46:55] santiycr: if the project was driven by a single person or group, this discussion would have never happened
[20:47:27] hugs: Hi, adamgoucher. What am I ignoring?
[20:47:42] santiycr: what's healthier for constant improvement than people disagreeing on what needs to be done?
[20:47:43] hugs: Whether a record/playback tool should be in the project at all?
[20:48:50] adamgoucher: hugs: you specifically, nothing. the project around defining how things should get into the project umbrella, which ones, the mechanism for inclusion, etc. its been dodged and avoided with opera and phantomjs
[20:49:35] adamgoucher: (but i dont think record/playback should with what we have learned about writing maintainable automation)
[20:50:18] hugs: adamgoucher: We/You should create a Builder extension that does all those things we talked about years ago at the ATDD meeting in Chicago. 
[20:50:28] hugs: 1) Warn bout more than 10 recorded steps. 2) Don't allow saving, only exporting. And call it "strict mode".
[20:50:49] adamgoucher: why have it as an extension though. make it mandatory.
[20:50:56] hugs: 3) only record by id or label (no xpath)
[20:51:25] adamgoucher: 'this will hurt you, but we are going to enable you to do it anyways' seems like a not-great idea
[20:51:29] hugs: my shrewd use of the phrase "strict mode" implies that language communities have this same dilemma
[20:52:22] hugs: in Perl, there is a "use strict" pragma
[20:52:37] hugs: and you're basically arguing for that... Be strict with our users.
[20:52:46] adamgoucher: perl as an examplar is not necessarily the best thing...
[20:53:01] hugs: :-)
[20:53:03] hugs: Although messier, I believe it's better to be more gentle in applying pressure
[20:53:44] hugs: in other languages, there's the belief in using good lint tools (See: JSLint and JavaScript, the good parts)
[20:53:56] hugs: my point is... those strict tools are optional
[20:54:07] hugs: when strictness is enforced, you get Java.
[20:54:11] *hugs ducks
[20:54:52] hugs: what we're missing is an opt-in mode to IDE or Builder that is the moral equivalent of "strict mode"
[20:55:25] adamgoucher: <shrug> the proposal is already +4 (or more?) which is about 45% of active people to my -1. I expect it to carry. And for me to continue to get Se-[IDE|Builder] rescue projects
[20:55:57] adamgoucher: (and i still think its more a project merge than ip donation since anyone with the bit on se-builder should automatically get it on se once the tree transfer happens)
[20:57:09] hugs: there are two people involved there with Builder. Adam Christian (saucer), and David Starks.
[20:57:21] hugs: but this isn't a submarine way to get more people commit bits
[20:57:34] adamgoucher: i know (i just couldnt remember davids name…)
[20:57:55] AutomatedTester: tbh, admc has shown enough chops over the years that even putting him to the vote would be a slam dunk
[20:58:15] adamgoucher: (i thought he had it already actually)

[21:06:08] gates: gates? im a gates.
[21:06:30] adamgoucher: okay! don't move then!
[21:07:13] adamgoucher: alright. you people stress me out. i'm going to the comic book store.

[21:09:27] hugs: adamgoucher: gone. :-(
[21:09:49] hugs: for the record/transcript... yeah, we're rapidly approaching that moment where our current decision making (non)-rules are not scaling effectively.
[21:10:48] bfife: recursion error. deciding on how to make decisions
[21:13:11] hugs: bfife: thankfully, we can look into other threads (other OSS projects) and see how they're managing their stack depth.
[21:13:33] hugs: metaphor error? (I hope I just made sense.)
[21:13:44] bfife: :>

[22:46:01] sjuxax: wait.until { element = driver.find_element(:xpath, '//*[@id="result_1"]/div[1]/ul[2]/li[2]/button[1]') } never finishes, TimeoutError.
[22:46:04] sjuxax: Yes, the element is there.
[22:46:07] sjuxax: Works fine in Fx 16
[22:46:15] Ardesco_H: the xpath looks brittle
[22:46:32] sjuxax: No, it's solid on this page. That element and xpath exists.
[22:46:53] Ardesco_H: I'm not aware of any issues
