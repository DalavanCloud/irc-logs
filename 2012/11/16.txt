[01:38:26] dogarrhea: so the chrome driver is just sitting there. and the selenium program is doing nothing
[01:38:39] dogarrhea: why is it not working?
[01:39:09] dogarrhea: [1115/175424:FATAL:webdriver_automation.cc(266)] Check failed: version_parts.size() == 4 && base::StringToInt(version_parts[2], &build_no). Can't rewrite message (type: 959) because unknown server (version: ***CHANNEL_ERROR**
[01:39:23] dogarrhea: i think it's time for selenium version 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
[01:39:26] dogarrhea: since they can't get any versions right
[01:39:42] KaibutsuX: chromedriver is a POS
[01:39:54] stephend: by they, you mean the contributors in this channel that keep the project alive?
[01:40:27] dogarrhea: i mean Google.
[01:40:45] dogarrhea: who pays developers to make this piece of shit take up space on the internet
[01:40:59] dogarrhea: i tried firefox driver before this and it just stops running tests for no reason
[01:41:03] dogarrhea: no errros. just hangs.
[01:41:07] stephend: dogarrhea: it's worked for me for 5 years
[01:41:28] dogarrhea: mmm hmmm
[01:41:40] stephend: you could file a well-written issue
[01:41:47] KaibutsuX: dogarrhea, are you on the latest chromedriver?
[01:41:53] KaibutsuX: and I assume latest chrome?
[01:41:55] o3u has joined #selenium
[01:41:57] dogarrhea: it's like 2.9 or something
[01:42:29] KaibutsuX: mine is: VERSION chromedriver-23.0.1240.0
[01:42:38] KaibutsuX: or you mean 29.0?
[01:44:10] dogarrhea: let me check
[01:44:35] dogarrhea: chromedriver_win_22_0_1203_0b.zip is what it says in download list
[01:44:47] KaibutsuX: well I would upgrade it
[01:45:06] KaibutsuX: my 23 is old, i havent used it in a while and I had problems with chromes update schedule always breaking the driver
[01:45:48] dogarrhea: http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list ?
[01:45:54] dogarrhea: this is where I got the driver
[01:46:13] KaibutsuX: yeah you want 23.1240
[01:46:20] dogarrhea: i'm basically using try catch to restart the driver every time it fails which is every 2 minutes or so
[01:48:10] KaibutsuX: well the problem isn't the driver doing things, it's usually just connecting to the driver, which would explain why it's just sitting there
[01:48:15] KaibutsuX: I would try the update and see what happens
[01:48:54] dogarrhea: running the test again
[01:49:52] KaibutsuX: fyi, firefox's driver is integrated with selenium and much faster than chrome
[01:50:06] dogarrhea:  Element is no longer attached to the DOM (WARNING: The server did not provide any stacktrace information) another error
[01:50:12] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[01:50:44] KaibutsuX: thats a legitimate error
[01:50:47] KaibutsuX: what are you testing?
[01:51:11] dogarrhea: seeing if some xpath element exists
[01:51:11] KaibutsuX: I assume that was a StaleElementException
[01:51:26] KaibutsuX: you mean some element exists using xpath?
[01:51:59] dogarrhea: yea. upon the the restart of the chrome driver it goes through it 
[01:52:48] KaibutsuX: why are you restarting chromedriver?
[01:52:57] KaibutsuX: it should start, run your test and then close
[01:53:16] dogarrhea: because it likes to error all the time
[01:53:27] KaibutsuX: what language are you in?
[01:53:30] dogarrhea: java
[01:53:35] KaibutsuX: jesus
[01:53:48] KaibutsuX: well you mean when you get that error you kill the driver and restart?
[01:54:29] dogarrhea: sometimes it can't find an element
[01:54:48] dogarrhea: sometimes it hangs for a long time. this morning i left it running and somehow it bypassed the try catch and never bothered to restart at all
[01:55:02] dogarrhea: sometimes it hangs and does nothing
[01:55:23] KaibutsuX: can you paste your code to pastebin or something?
[01:55:35] KaibutsuX: i dont know java very well but I can take a look
[01:56:25] dogarrhea: hrm i can't really do it. it's corporate
[01:56:41] dogarrhea: right now it's stuck on waiting for some request to finish for about 2 minutes or so
[01:56:46] KaibutsuX: strip out the test and url, just give me the driver.start and try catch block
[01:56:52] dogarrhea: and the driver is just sitting and sitting and sitting
[01:57:28] KaibutsuX: are you using wrappers or calling the native webdriver methods?
[01:57:40] KaibutsuX: I think you need to narrow it down to what exactly is causing the problem
[01:57:48] dogarrhea:        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\Users\\Alex\\Downloads\\chromedriver_win_23.0.1240.0\\chromedriver.exe");        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();  this is how i start it heh
[01:58:37] dogarrhea: http://www.pasteall.org/37270  this is the contents of the catch block
[01:58:41] KaibutsuX: just checking, that path isn't by channce the zip file that you downloaded is it?
[01:58:50] KaibutsuX: you did unpack it?
[01:59:07] dogarrhea: that i did.
[01:59:10] KaibutsuX: haha ok

[02:00:12] KaibutsuX: you're not using the RC server are you?
[02:00:45] dogarrhea: rc server?
[02:01:39] KaibutsuX: i mean you're not connecting to something like: http://localhost:444/wd/hub
[02:01:56] KaibutsuX: you just call driver.get('http://www.google.com') right?
[02:02:04] dogarrhea: in my webdriver geturl stuff?
[02:02:19] dogarrhea: nothing on my localhost that i'm connecting to
[02:02:24] KaibutsuX: ok
[02:02:41] KaibutsuX: so what if you do simple tests like just do a get('http://www.google.com') ?
[02:02:43] KaibutsuX: does that load?
[02:02:55] dogarrhea: yes. 
[02:03:05] dogarrhea: it waits for quite a while on "trying to resolve proxy"
[02:03:57] KaibutsuX: hmm, let me look at something
[02:05:57] dogarrhea: i think some of these stale element things are caused by reallly slow driver execution
[02:06:18] KaibutsuX: well that sucks
[02:06:19] KaibutsuX: http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=141
[02:06:46] KaibutsuX: well stale usually means that the element was successfully retreived the page has changed since then
[02:07:02] KaibutsuX: maybe it's an issue with the java/chromedriver bindings
[02:07:13] KaibutsuX: you could try downgrading chrome if thats possible

[04:55:31] dogarrhea: The Element is not Attached to the DOM A common technique used for simulating a tabbed UI in a web app is to prepare DIVs for each tab, but only attach one at a time, storing the rest in variables. In this case, it's entirely possible that your code might have a reference to an element that is no longer attached to the DOM (that is, that has an ancestor which is "document.documentElement").  If WebDriver throws a stale element ex

[17:00:48] freynaud_: what's the reason for testAnElementFoundInADifferentFrameIsStale ? as long as we have a reference to and element, and it's still on the page, why does it matter we're not in the same frame anymore ?
[17:05:19] jimevans: RossPatterson: okay, i get it. lukeis posted the link to the video, not me though, hence my confusion.
[17:05:33] xeranas has joined #selenium
[17:08:39] lukeis: freynaud_: if you find an element and switch frames you loose reference to that element, but if you switch back to it you'll still have the reference. frame context matters
[17:09:05] lukeis: s/loose/lose/ :)
[17:09:25] freynaud_: lukeis:  I don't get that. Why do I have to loose the reference ?
[17:09:54] lukeis: the frame (window) has the reference to the found object… not window.top
[17:10:01] RossPatterson: DOH!
[17:10:29] freynaud_: lukeis: that's an implementation detail, a user doesn't see if the content comes from a iframe or not
[17:11:10] lukeis: true… but we've leaked implementation of the frame issue out through the api
[17:11:48] lukeis: if we didn't have switch_to_frame, then I would agree with you :)
[17:12:08] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[17:12:15] freynaud_: lukeis: hum, annoying.
[17:13:10] lukeis: frames are a bitch… i wish they were removed from the html spec :)
[17:15:15] barancev: frames are for good, they isolate potenially dangerous content from the main page (think about adv banners)
[17:16:26] barancev: if you suggest to add another container with isolation to the html spec it will be the same essentially
[17:16:28] lukeis: that's a cop out for allowing advertisers to put whatever content they want on a (your) site
[17:17:15] lukeis: not saying it'll happen… but I could envision a world without frames ;)
[17:19:51] barancev: no advertisement -> no google as we know it :)
[17:20:16] lukeis: they could still do ads with JS
[17:20:41] barancev: too dangerous, without isolation
[17:20:52] barancev: text only?
[17:21:25] barancev: lynx browser...
[17:21:45] lukeis: thinking of frames, i think the frame switching api needs a way to switch_to_frame_parent
[17:22:25] lukeis: or maybe it does and I've never tried switching to execute_script("return window.parent")
[17:22:32] lukeis: hmm
[17:22:34] barancev: I suggested this to simonstewart, but my authority was not enough to beat his authority :)
[17:22:45] lukeis: did he shoot it down?
[17:22:50] barancev: yes
[17:22:58] lukeis: give any valid reason? :)
[17:23:32] lukeis: we have commit access… we could add it and then let him revert it ;)
[17:23:51] barancev: "you can do this with existing API - just go to top (default_content) and then back to a required frame"
[17:23:57] lukeis: boooooo
[17:24:17] lukeis: i've had to deal with a site 5 levels deep… really annoying to get to a sibling frame
[17:24:57] barancev: let's sign a petition in support of switchTo().parentFrame() ?
[17:25:04] lukeis: signed
[17:26:57] adamgoucher: what i want is driver.current_frame so i can switch into a frame then back out
[17:27:17] *adamgoucher has two frame happy clients right now...
[17:27:51] barancev: back out? not to the parent but to an arbitrary frame?
[17:29:02] adamgoucher: yup. or more correctly back to the frame i was in before skipping to a different frame to click a button
[17:29:50] barancev: it's the parent only, in the current API
[17:30:08] barancev: you can switch to a child frame with switchTo().frame(...)
[17:30:22] barancev: child only
[17:30:37] barancev: so "back out" == "to the parent"
[17:31:03] *jimevans thinks of the nightmare in the IE driver of keeping different frame references, and begins weeping uncontrollably
[17:31:08] lukeis: sounds like adamgoucher wants switch_to_frame_parent ;)
[17:31:49] *barancev hugs jimevans
[17:32:03] dude-x: so Hostess is going bankrupt. good riddance. their junk food tastes like a chemistry experiment gone wrong
[17:32:20] barancev: no long jumps, only switch to the parent, that's all
[17:33:15] lukeis: jimevans: window.parent isn't a *hard* reference to find, is it? :)

[17:36:34] barancev: NoSuchFrameException?
[17:37:27] jimevans: not only that, but it'd be a good idea to get that before the w3c spec authors. :)

[17:48:05] lukeis: i too will be out all next week… going to disneyland with the kids followed by turkey day
[17:48:18] jimevans: besides, next week being a super short week for US-based folks, we'll want to wait until at least the week after.
[17:48:34] barancev: I'd wait for FF17 too
[17:48:49] barancev: it's in 5 days
[17:49:00] lukeis: maybe we should run the tests against it ;)
[17:49:02] jimevans: the disney folks need a place called "dadland" as part of the magic kingdom. 
[17:49:16] lukeis: they serve booze in CA ;)
[17:49:54] jimevans: not at the magic kingdom in florida. epcot, sure, especially during the food and wine festival.
[17:49:58] *jimevans was just there
[17:50:13] dude-x: ah i still remmeber only epcot served booze
[17:50:18] dude-x: and i was there in the 90's
[17:50:34] jimevans: a buddy of mine has a standup routing about the happiest f*cking place on earth.
[17:50:41] lukeis: hmm, actually i think only california adventure serves booze… well that and in the restaurants
[17:50:48] jimevans: and they need "dad land"
[17:51:30] jimevans: featuring a ride where you get a beer and a plate of wings, a sporting event on a tv, and no squalling little ones.
[17:51:44] lukeis: sounds kinda like hooters ;)
[17:52:51] jimevans: well, yeah, but one where you need it, after dealing with all the idjits and their brats. most people are okay, but there's always that *one* family that really gets on your nerves.

[18:13:22] barancev: is SessionNotFoundException deprecated? there is not a single usage
[18:14:29] barancev: I think we should chhose between SessionNotFoundException and SessionTerminatedException
[18:14:43] barancev: one should remain, another one should go away
[18:16:38] barancev: SessionNotFoundException is better because we never can know whether a session with the given ID is terminated ot never existed
[18:17:34] barancev: I should rework it...

[18:34:58] ^A^kira: guys is there any conviniet way to assign custom user-agent for webdriver
[18:34:59] ^A^kira: ?
[18:35:10] jleyba: depends on the browser
[18:35:16] ^A^kira: phantomjs
[18:35:42] jleyba: Can't help you there.  Haven't used ghostdriver yet
[18:37:39] lukeis: you'd have to hack around in the ghostdriver js, but basically you just need to add this line "page.settings.userAgent = 'your-user-agent'"  
[18:37:42] ^A^kira: isn't there some convinient way more or less same for every driver?
[18:37:48] lukeis: no
[18:37:56] jleyba: and there probably won't be
[18:38:05] lukeis: the point of webdriver is to use that browser… not to spoof user agents
[18:39:09] ^A^kira: ye but phantomjs sending itself like "Python-urllib/2.7"
[18:39:27] lukeis: is that a problem?
[18:39:33] ^A^kira: which is unexceptable for website which checks useragents

[19:52:08] barancev: IllegalLocatorException is a bastard

[19:53:25] jleyba: and is used by the HtmlUnitDriver only
