[04:14:26] mbrochh: hi all. im trying to test a django app with selenium. seems to work but the chrome window opens and closes within a second, when i set breakpoints in the test, they don't get hit... is there a way to debug selenium tests and keep the browser window open to see what happens step by step?
[04:16:32] mbrochh: hmm it seems as if my test isn't called at all....

[18:04:47] *lukeis decides to troll intchanter-work, the best choice is not perl :)    but seriously, i think that's the only one for perl with WebDriver (well, last time I looked around)

[18:07:38] chrisculver701: suppose JimEvans is probably the only one with an answer for this, when i do driver.Url = "file:///D:/Code/Nexus-UITestFramework/Tests/WebPages/test.html" the driver has invalid exceptions for any properties or methods after that
[18:08:01] estellevw_ has joined #selenium
[18:09:13] lukeis: yuck, make sure you tell him which version of IE… i think security around local file access changed between versions somewhere
[18:10:38] chrisculver701: lukeis: will do, thanks

[18:12:34] lukeis: true that
[18:12:43] barancev: browsers have lots of security restrictions related to file://
[18:12:47] chrisculver701: yeah

[18:15:00] chrisculver701: wrong : the first time
[18:16:05] lukeis: but i like barancev suggestion, start up apache httpd locally and you can even tell it to server up all files on D: if you want ;)
[18:16:09] lukeis: that's D :
[18:16:12] lukeis: not D:

[18:43:19] intchanter-work: With the work that I'm doing, it may be possible to get authorization to spend some time maintaining the perl bindings and the formatter.

[18:43:45] intchanter-work: I can't guarantee that until I've run it through the necessary channels, but it's at least a possibility.
[18:43:55] lukeis: barancev: they are maintained externally, i just don't know where :) but they should be closed and linked to where they are maintained
