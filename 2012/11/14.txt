[14:43:52] barancev: yes, submitted correctly
[14:43:58] jimevans: you need to change the version info in two places. you've done one. the second is above that at FILEVERSION 2,26,2,0 and PRODUCTVERSION 2,26,2,0. The last field should be ,1.
[14:44:18] barancev: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/cpp/IEDriverServer/IEDriverServer.rc -- both are "2.26.2.1"
[14:44:44] barancev: I see...
[14:44:50] jimevans: barancev: lines 105 and 107 in that same file.
[14:45:06] barancev: there are two places in this file that contains version numbers
[14:45:31] jimevans: yes. that's the visual studio resource script format.
[14:46:07] barancev: a moment...
[14:47:50] jimevans: i have no idea why the damned thing is crashing in the IE10 tests. i had it working against the windows 7 IE10 preview yesterday. i suppose it could be changes in windows 8 that are causing it, but i don't have any way to debug that.
[14:49:28] AutomatedTester: jimevans: you'll solve it, we have faith in you

[15:31:25] adamgoucher: dude-x: leave the actual graphing for the humans, check the input through automation. unless you are writing the charting library, just worry about the inputs

[15:31:49] dekronin1 has joined #selenium
[15:32:55] dude-x: Got it. Yeah this chart stuff I'll leave alone. not worth my time to delve into it programmatically.
[15:35:11] adamgoucher: it might be fun, but have to be careful not to test 3rd party stuff. often the workflow is 'do somehting, get the response json/xml, pump to chart' -- the trick might be to make sure they save the json/xml where you can get it via js exectuor then parse in your script
[15:37:15] dude-x: since I have a lot of work to do in just creating page objects for every aspect of the website, i'll leave that level of automation for the future

[15:48:44] chrisculver701: yeah
[15:48:53] AutomatedTester: chrisculver701: but if your boss is game for giving you time to study a course I recommend working with an OSS project on testing

[15:50:49] chrisculver701: ah

[17:49:26] KaibutsuX: I'm having issues where d.title sometimes returns None, even though the page has fully loaded
[17:50:30] KaibutsuX: i used to do a while loop for while the the title didn't have a length, keep retrying for 3 seconds, and it worked, I would ALWAYS get a title, but without the loop sometimes the title doesn't get returned the first try
[17:52:04] lukeis: there is an ExpectedCondition to combine with WebDriverWait for a title to appear

[19:00:40] dude-x: doesn't matter
[19:01:04] KaibutsuX: apparently title returns '' if the server never responds

[19:04:44] KaibutsuX: oh yeah, I was just trying to reduce the number of times I had to access title if possible
[19:04:52] KaibutsuX: I was just trying to reduce code by a line
[19:05:13] dude-x: or write it as an expression: lambda d: d.title. if d.title else False)
[19:05:44] KaibutsuX: ahh, expression, good thinking
[19:09:02] KaibutsuX: just trying to understand here, technically the else would never return in any condition because the wait is always waiting for a True condition, correct

[19:13:35] KaibutsuX: i wonder what a title that's not actually set would return
[19:13:41] KaibutsuX: if the title actually is ''
[19:14:15] dude-x: no title set is the empty string
[19:14:22] dude-x: otherwise an exception
[19:14:31] dude-x: if the code to get the title can't run
[19:15:31] KaibutsuX: I'm saying that means if a page has a title explicitly set to '', then a wait will always wait x seconds because it's looking for a true when in reality that '' title is the correct result
[19:15:54] dude-x: oh then in that case, don't use that function
[19:15:58] KaibutsuX: haha
[19:15:59] dude-x: or else you'll get a timeout exception
[19:16:00] KaibutsuX: yeah

[20:37:56] AutomatedTester: but thats my 2c
[20:37:59] AutomatedTester: 1p
[20:39:21] jimevans: AutomatedTester: I don't necessarily disagree. I don't care for the multitude of interfaces used by the statically-typed languages, forcing everyone to cast like crazy to get the functionality you need.
[20:39:53] jimevans: (and i say this as one who implemented the damned thing that way)
[20:40:49] AutomatedTester: in my .NET days I wouldnt have implemented as many interfaces but I am not one to really cast stones
[20:41:16] *AutomatedTester has made a lot of horrible code in .NET
[20:41:21] barancev: jimevans: is there Augmenter in C# binding?
[20:41:46] jimevans: barancev: no.
[20:41:48] AutomatedTester: so I have a reduced test case where we arent returning a good JSON object 
[20:42:10] jleyba: you know our interface choices aren't set in stone
[20:42:17] AutomatedTester: in languages like JS it errors
[20:42:36] jleyba: if the group thinks RWD should implement them all and throw UnsupportedOperation (or whatever) if the underlying driver doesn't support it, we can make that decision
[20:42:40] jimevans: jleyba: yeah, i know. i just haven't given it the thought it deserves.
[20:43:44] jleyba: The two interfaces I think should be part of the core WebDriver interface are TakesScreenshot and JavascriptExecutor
[20:43:45] AutomatedTester: jleyba: at Mozilla we use grid a lot and we need screenshots
[20:43:49] barancev: I'd prefer this pattern for Java too, but simonstewart likes manipulations with interfaces :)
[20:44:00] jleyba: The only thing that doesn't support those 2 is dirty dirty HtmlUnit

[20:47:17] *jleyba will let someone else implement it for safari
[20:47:21] DarkRift: good to know
[20:47:33] jleyba: DarkRift: the returned png would only contain the content box for the element
[20:47:39] AutomatedTester: DarkRift: apparently Googlers are jumping up and down for that functionality
[20:47:49] jleyba: AutomatedTester: not really
[20:48:30] DarkRift: that's actually good to be able to take a screenshot of a specific element when you want to debug small pieces of UI instead of the whole page
[20:48:51] DarkRift: so the focus is really on what matters
[20:48:58] jleyba: AutomatedTester: when you write that into the spec, please cover edge case behavior
[20:49:00] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I will chalk that in the same category as "Googlers want the browser to take screenshots in rapid succession"
[20:49:32] jleyba: AutomatedTester: that one was brand spanking new.  I heard about it like 2 days before that email went out :)
[20:50:03] AutomatedTester: jleyba: but you all discussed it in depth in London apparently... *stops trolling now*
[20:50:21] jleyba: No, we discussed the perf timings
[20:50:46] jleyba: Having webdriver be able to grab those from the browser as a special log type
[20:51:01] barancev: what area should be captured for an element? first non-zero rect? all rects? how to count padding and margin?
[20:51:02] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I remember that, I dialed in at that part. The other parts just seems fantastical...
[20:51:27] AutomatedTester: barancev: what ever the element describes its size as
[20:51:31] barancev: we'll have hard time implementing elementshots
[20:51:42] AutomatedTester: barancev: why?
[20:52:02] jleyba: AutomatedTester: what if the element is not in the view port?  should the browser scroll it into view?  (would be a necessary action for the SafariDriver, as its implemented now)
[20:52:42] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I honestly cant remember. I suspect yes
[20:53:00] AutomatedTester: since some browsers render below the fold 2nd
[20:53:15] AutomatedTester: and above the fold first
[20:53:33] jarib: looks like it should be pretty simple in gecko, the drawWindow() call already supports x/y/width/height parameters
[20:53:33] barancev: what if an element partially covered by anoter element? what should be captured?
[20:53:54] jleyba: barancev: that doesn't matter.  an element screenshot would be a rendering of the canvas for the element's content box
[20:54:00] jleyba: so if it's partially covered, you'd see that
[20:54:17] jarib: and it already renders the full viewport
[20:54:41] barancev: is not is better to provide a method to capture a rect with the given coords?
[20:55:01] barancev: and you can pass element dimentions to this method
[20:55:02] AutomatedTester: barancev: a hacky way to do it is to capture the entire screenshot and crop down to the info we have. so it will just show like if it were in a full screenshot
[20:55:34] AutomatedTester: barancev: whats the use case?
[20:55:50] AutomatedTester: to pass in co-ords instead of element?
[20:56:16] jleyba: AutomatedTester: might be useful if you wanted to know what the first 100px of your page lookedl ike
[20:56:21] barancev: what if I want to get a shot of an "opened menu"?
[20:56:42] jleyba: barancev: get the container element for the menu and take a screenshot of it
[20:56:55] barancev: what if I know that my element shifted 100px right from the location returned by getLocation?

[21:09:29] barancev: jimevans: I'm looking at #4766 -- it's very interesting, we have two scroll modes (top, bottom) but the issues shows how the browser scrolls viewport to the *left*, and we cannot change this behaviour

[21:10:12] jimevans: the scroll modes are based on the argument passed to the javascript function element.scrollIntoView().
[21:10:27] jimevans: that function takes a boolean.
[21:10:58] jimevans: which means either "scroll just enough to show the element" or "scroll the element all the way to the top of the viewport"
[21:11:01] barancev: I understand, that's not our undertaking, browser does not allow to specify this
[21:13:34] barancev: document.getElementsByName("q")[0].scrollIntoView() actually scrolls page to the left

[21:22:25] barancev: I should think about it a bit more

[22:31:26] barancev: another interesting bug #4757
[22:31:28] selbot2_: 03 open/new Firefox not firing TimeoutException with presenceOfElementLocated locating xpath - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4757 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Status-Untriaged Lang-Java]
[22:31:57] AutomatedTester: thats Java
[22:32:35] barancev: it's firefox-driver -- findElement falls into waiting cycle on this page, DelayedCommand.prototype.shouldDelayExecutionForPendingRequest_ never allows it to continue
[22:33:32] barancev: no signs one should use "unstable" load strategy for this page
[22:33:35] barancev: get is ok
[22:33:45] barancev: but findElement hands
[22:34:11] barancev: error console is full of ""Ignoring pending about:document-onload-blocker request"" messages
[22:35:53] barancev: simplified scenario: https://gist.github.com/4075419
[22:36:16] barancev: what's this about:document-onload-blocker request means?
[22:36:49] AutomatedTester: ahh...
[22:38:05] barancev: AutomatedTester: you know what it is, right? :)
[22:38:12] AutomatedTester: no
[22:38:25] barancev: mmm......
[22:38:38] AutomatedTester: as lukeis would say
[22:38:44] AutomatedTester: halting problem and all htat

[23:23:42] dude-x: gotta love floating point math
[23:24:18] dude-x: width = 69.8% for one div, width = 30.200000000000003%
[23:24:46] AutomatedTester: dude-x: JavaScript <3 floating point maths
[23:25:09] dude-x: can you truncate numbers?
[23:25:18] lukeis: yep
[23:25:54] dude-x: i'll file an issue then
[23:26:23] lukeis: what's the issue?
[23:26:30] dude-x: too many bytes!
[23:26:31] dude-x: :p
[23:26:42] dude-x: actually it's not really an issue
[23:27:19] dude-x: but i think it would look nicer if this progress like bar thingie would format the widths with fixed precision
[23:27:27] dude-x: it has no bearing on how it looks to the uesr
[23:27:35] dude-x: but it could save a few bytes of transimssion
[23:28:32] dude-x: from an automation point of view, I can verify that the progress bar is properly formatted
