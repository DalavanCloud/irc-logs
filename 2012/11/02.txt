[11:21:07] Ardesco: i suppose it's kind of possible in a way

[11:47:06] arex\: hm, so this is the way to do performance testing of web applications?
[11:47:08] jarib has joined #selenium
[11:55:18] Ardesco: i would do i based upon the feel of the page tbh
[11:55:26] Ardesco: it's going to vary between machines
[11:55:45] Ardesco: yslow should give you a decent idea i guess
[11:56:40] Ardesco: the problem is that it's a very subjective thing, some pages that take a long time to render are usable almost instantly so you don't notice stuff going on in the background
[11:57:09] Ardesco: others that aren't as slow to render are locked until rendering has completed and are horrible to use
[11:58:01] Ardesco: the best you could do with selenium would be to start a timer, load a page and then stop the timer
[11:58:15] Ardesco: but that doesn't guarantee all rendering has completed
[11:58:52] Ardesco: so you would then need to start doing things like checking jQuery.active === 0
[11:59:08] Ardesco: or that a known element that renders last has appeared
[11:59:23] Ardesco: and all of these things take time as well
[11:59:34] Ardesco: so the actual number you end up with is likely going to be inflated

[15:05:07] jamesoram: KaibutsuX, the xpath looks good, have you tried inspecting with firepath?

[18:00:53] jimevans: which of course gives me a runtime error.
[18:01:58] jimevans: cannot load such file ci/reporter/rspec.
[18:03:52] jarib: jimevans: try `rake //rb:install-gems` first
[18:03:57] jarib: i got to run
[18:04:17] jimevans: hah! that's the ticket.
[18:04:24] jarib: but should be able to do the release later today (or tomorrow) if IE is ok
[18:04:27] jimevans: i knew i must be missing some prereqs.
[18:04:45] jarib: linux is looking good so far: https://next.travis-ci.org/jarib/selenium-travis
[18:05:03] jimevans: alright, now we're getting tests to run.
[18:05:39] jarib: bbl
[18:06:21] jimevans: jarib: when you return, no failures for ie.

[19:34:24] jimevans: the safari driver build is complaining.
[19:39:02] jleyba: jimevans: looking
[19:39:43] barancev|2: jimevans: what Java test should be added for your commit?
[19:39:59] barancev|2: we have some tests that do click SHIFT, and they were green
[19:41:10] jimevans: barancev|2: none. it affects no tests that use native events, and only affects browsers that use the "type" atom for typing text. at the moment, that means safari, or IE with native events turned off.
[19:41:19] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[19:41:40] jimevans: firefox synthetic events doesn't use the atom for typing.
[19:41:52] jleyba: it should
[19:41:58] jimevans: but it doesn't
[19:42:08] jleyba: i've just been really lazy and find something else to do every time i remember it's not
[19:42:14] jimevans: it has it's own typing implementation.
[19:42:50] jimevans: it kinda sucks, but i'm not going to stress over it, since marionette is on its way. :)
[19:43:04] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[19:43:18] jimevans: this was primarily implemented for synthetic events in IE, with a happy accident that it helps safari too.
[19:43:23] jleyba: has there been any discussion about selenium 3.0?
[19:43:26] barancev|2: is it worth to add a CI job for IE with synthesized events?
[19:43:29] AutomatedTester: jleyba: yes
[19:43:48] jleyba: AutomatedTester: any time frame?
[19:43:52] jimevans: (actually, it was primarily added for ghostdriver, but then i changed ghostdriver to use phantomjs's native event implementation)
[19:44:06] jleyba: The moment that @Deprecated tag goes out, I'm going to close every single RC bug on our tracker :)
[19:44:24] AutomatedTester: jleyba: "soon", we made some breaking changes to webdriver spec to our current implementation
[19:44:40] jleyba: AutomatedTester: like what?
[19:44:53] AutomatedTester: changing error codes from int to string
[19:45:01] jleyba: laaaaame
[19:45:30] jimevans: d'oh! i missed that in the latest spec revision.
[19:45:41] AutomatedTester: jimevans: we havent written it in yet
[19:45:46] AutomatedTester: its in the meeting minutes
[19:45:52] jimevans: well, that'd be why i didn't see it.
[19:45:53] barancev|2: jleyba: RC issues are 150 out of 1220 total, ~10%, not much
[19:46:10] AutomatedTester: barancev|2: IDE issues?
[19:46:14] jleyba: yes!
[19:46:17] AutomatedTester: the count?
[19:46:30] jleyba: IDE really should be a sub-project
[19:46:31] barancev|2: are we going to deprecate IDE? 
[19:46:48] jleyba: I don't think we can justify that, but I don't think it should be part of the main project
[19:46:50] barancev|2: 157 IDE issues
[19:46:56] jleyba: there are way more than that
[19:47:05] jleyba: they just haven't been labeled properly
[19:47:07] AutomatedTester: apparently we are awaiting an email fron Hugs about IDE
[19:47:31] AutomatedTester: yea, 157 seems low
[19:47:39] jimevans: jleyba: oh, i see one problem.
[19:48:13] jleyba: jimevans: in action.js "var keyboard = opt_keyboard || new bot.Keyboard()"
[19:48:24] jimevans: that's the one i spotted.
[19:48:25] AutomatedTester: jleyba: we did discuss webdriverjs
[19:48:41] barancev|2: jleyba: all open issues are labeled properly
[19:49:05] jleyba: in keyboard.js, it thinks startPos and endPos are not always initialized
[19:49:05] AutomatedTester: about how we dont want to, in the spec, stipulate content to chrome communication
[19:49:20] jleyba: jimevans: so i'd just default them to 0
[19:49:49] AutomatedTester: jimevans: if you have a bug in typing create a test to type to <body>
[19:50:03] AutomatedTester: that shows a lot of sins
[19:50:12] jleyba: can't do that with synthetic events
[19:50:27] jleyba: only FF can b/c it does synthetic events from a protected context
[19:50:44] AutomatedTester: e.g. moz#805403

[19:51:12] jimevans: jleyba: thanks. got it.
[19:51:35] jleyba: AutomatedTester: not sure I see what's special about webdriverjs and the spec.  it's just another language binding
[19:51:52] AutomatedTester: jleyba: webdriverjs can work in process
[19:51:59] AutomatedTester: all the others work out of process
[19:52:21] jimevans: protip: build the safari driver before checking in a change to the atoms.
[19:52:25] jleyba: AutomatedTester: it *can* work in process. but it uses a special protocol to talk to our java server
[19:52:29] jleyba: that's outside of the spec
[19:52:40] jleyba: (notice it's only documented on the webdriverjs wiki, not the json protocol)
[19:53:01] AutomatedTester: jleyba: that was the discussion we had :)
[19:53:08] AutomatedTester: and we agree its outside of the spec
[19:53:32] jleyba: Hope you didn't spend much time on that
[19:53:40] AutomatedTester: about 5 mins

[19:54:19] AutomatedTester: alarm bells we going off in my head when Simon mentioned it
[19:54:25] stephend: hrm
[19:54:33] stephend: has android registration w/grid changed in 2.26.0?
[19:54:40] jimevans: and *that's* why we have a CI server. :)
[19:54:56] jimevans: stephend: not that i know of, but anything's possible.
[19:55:15] jimevans: *I* didn't change anything like that. :)
[19:56:12] jleyba: stephend: I make it a point not to touch android code
[19:59:22] AutomatedTester: stephend: what are you seeing?

[20:06:33] KaibutsuX: good questions
[20:06:40] KaibutsuX: question, let me look at that
[20:10:28] KaibutsuX: hmm, no frame at this particular point
[20:11:11] jimevans: for sendKeys using LocalFileDetector in java, does it zip the file and serialize it to base64?
[20:12:22] barancev|2: jimevans: I've found repro scenario for alert failures -- https://gist.github.com/4004111
[20:13:15] barancev|2: it's not enough to deal with a prompt, you need to open and close a window before
[20:13:23] jimevans: barancev|2: and that passes for the other initialization scenarios you've commented out in your gist?
[20:13:26] barancev|2: so I think it *is* related to windows switching
[20:13:51] barancev|2: yes, it's on CI only, other envs are ok
[20:14:10] jimevans: okay, then. ping eranm, and possibly santiycr about it.
[20:14:15] barancev|2: localhost is Windows, 192.168.1.75 is ubintu
[20:14:31] barancev|2: ubuntu
[20:14:36] jimevans: we made the right choice to release, if it's only happening using the metacity window manager.
[20:15:36] *stephend is hitting 2.26.0 hard, and so far, great :-)
[20:15:40] stephend: thx to all for your hard work
[20:15:55] barancev|2: interesing is that tried to run tests one by one, and could not reproduce it
[20:17:55] barancev|2: only one test being run after another fails

[21:04:18] jcarr: yes
[21:04:25] lawcab: yes i did
[21:04:30] lawcab: did an svn update

[21:06:18] lawcab: is there a way to make sure I do a clean build of the webdriver
[21:06:48] jcarr: if you check out trunk, with no changes, and ./go iphone from the root directory, you'll get a .app file that's the same as everyone else is using.
[21:07:11] jcarr: are you using this in the sim or on a real device?
[21:07:26] jcarr: the process for a real device is something different I think and I'm not sure what exactly that is
