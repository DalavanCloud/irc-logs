We have a page that open a new window with a pdf document as well as relocating the current window to another page, when a button is clicked (Done in javascript). This works when we do it manually, but when run through selenium the relocation happens and the new window is opened, but the pdf document is never shown, and the content type of

[14:46:10] dawagner: It should be
[14:46:21] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: very
[14:47:04] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: the rewrite thats happening will hopefully give us webkit access
[14:47:14] AutomatedTester: barring unforeseen politics
[14:47:26] dawagner: Indeed, and chrome on android
[14:47:39] adamgoucher: discluding your writing it, would it be on par with the commitment mozilla has to marionette and opera to operadriver?
[14:47:50] dawagner: It has full time engineering headcount dedicated to it
[14:47:53] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: I dont know
[14:48:06] AutomatedTester: dawagner: until it gets into there waterfall its an unknown
[14:48:27] dawagner: There are tests for it in the waterfall, I'm just not sure which ones
[14:48:33] AutomatedTester: marionette is part of Firefox's waterfall and all commits get testing

[14:50:25] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: if my work with Test The Web Forward comes to fruition then it will have to be very well supported

[14:55:05] adamgoucher: which? the test the web forward?
[14:55:19] AutomatedTester: 15:02 AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: the rewrite thats happening will hopefully give us webkit access
[14:55:30] AutomatedTester: webkit !== Chrome
[14:56:09] adamgoucher: that raised an eyebrow --- but then was quashed by 'barring unforseen politics' since that means apple and google playing nice
[14:56:26] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: but if Apple have to do zero work
[14:57:04] dawagner: AutomatedTester: The new ChromeDriver which opens up webkit like that is actually very similar to freynaud's iOS driver's webview support

[IRC logfile - Started Fri Nov 23 15:00:25 2012]
[15:00:25] adamgoucher: ah. which i only realized i wasnt subscribed to until yesterday
[15:01:16] adamgoucher: speaking of which, the profile encoding stuff is just a sidebar in the spec. should it be its only separate section without the wishy-washy wording of 'could'?
[15:01:35] AutomatedTester: no
[15:01:46] AutomatedTester: not all browsers implement profiles
[15:02:01] AutomatedTester: 2 of the major browsers dont
[15:02:23] adamgoucher: yes, but a 'for browsers that have profiles, this is how you send them over the wire'
[15:02:39] AutomatedTester: it would have to be non-normative
[15:02:48] adamgoucher: 'could' always worries me in specs
[15:03:12] AutomatedTester: using stronger language suggests vendors need to implement profiles
[15:03:51] adamgoucher: is the 'proper' way to suggest a change to wordsmith something to the mailing list or do a pull request?
[15:04:09] dawagner: AutomatedTester: Yes it does.  It uses the developer tools debug protocol

[15:15:57] AutomatedTester: CarlJokl: ask away
[15:16:14] CarlJokl: When I look at the Google code project at the source tree
[15:16:35] CarlJokl: The /trunk/android directory has a /server and /client directory under it
[15:17:04] CarlJokl: However when I actually check the project out I do not get these directories just an /trunk/android/src directory
[15:17:06] adamgoucher: whats the magic svn command again to list all svn branches?
[15:17:28] CarlJokl: I was looking at the trunk as far as I am aware
[15:17:28] plightbo has joined #selenium
[15:17:43] CarlJokl: I wondered if it is anything to do with permissions
[15:17:50] dawagner: adamgoucher: svn ls https://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/branches ?
[15:17:56] CarlJokl: I.e. whether some of the repository is not openly available
[15:17:57] AutomatedTester: CarlJokl: what was your checkout command?
[15:17:59] dawagner: CarlJokl: We have no permissions in the repo
[15:18:08] AutomatedTester: CarlJokl: all of our code is OSS
[15:18:14] AutomatedTester: even our docs
[15:18:27] dawagner: I don't see a client or server directory under android

[15:18:39] Ardesc0_H has joined #selenium
[15:18:42] adamgoucher: dawagner: thats what i thought. of course, the bigger question is why cant i see the branch i'm supposed to… blech
[15:19:15] CarlJokl: Is it possible that these directories existed historically
[15:19:25] dawagner: Possible? The code has had a lot of reorg
[15:19:30] dawagner: What are you actually trying to do? :)
[15:20:50] CarlJokl: I was searching for the class: org.openqa.selenium.android.intents.IntentSender
[15:21:01] CarlJokl: In the bigger picture of what I am trying to do
[15:21:18] CarlJokl: I am trying to reverse engineer the Android WebDriver application
[15:21:29] dawagner: To do what?
[15:21:59] CarlJokl: To try and apply the same instrumentation to a WebView embedded in one of our applications for the sake of automated testing
[15:22:13] CarlJokl: The difficulty is that I am testing a hybrid application
[15:22:52] CarlJokl: I can test the web parts of the application with the existing WebDriver app but it requires mocking out the JavaScript bridge to the native app functionality
[15:23:09] CarlJokl: Ideally my goal is to test as close to the real application as possible
[15:23:20] CarlJokl: I don't know yet if it can be done or how hard it is
[15:23:48] CarlJokl: But in theory at least I may be able to take any any web view and interment it the was the Selenium app does
[15:24:31] AutomatedTester: CarlJokl: have a look at NativeDriver
[15:24:40] AutomatedTester: I dont know if it will do what you want but it might do

[15:29:35] Ardesco: i'm the one trolling now
[15:29:39] CarlJokl: I didn't know the Final Fantasy games went up to 17….oh Firefox 17...
[15:30:09] AutomatedTester: CarlJokl: have a look at what version Chrome is on before you carry on with that troll
[15:30:14] AutomatedTester: ;)
[15:30:42] Ardesco: full run of out tests in chrome = 6 mins
[15:30:43] dawagner: AutomatedTester: The difference is, we don't break things with every release ;)
[15:30:51] Ardesco: full run of our tests in FireFox = 10 mins
[15:30:56] CarlJokl: Erm 23?
[15:31:04] Ardesco: full run of our tests in IE9 = 44mins
[15:31:08] adamgoucher: gah! i dont understand this repo i'm supposed to be working in. and everyone is out buying all the stuff they were thankful for not having yesterday who could fix it
[15:31:10] Ardesco: \o/
[15:31:15] dawagner: I'm sure IE10 will fix things? Right?
[15:31:32] Ardesco: to be fair the chrome ones are running multiple threads hence why it's faster, with one thread they are about the same as chrome
[15:31:33] adamgoucher: Ardesco: are you doing screenshots?
[15:31:41] Ardesco: only on a fail
[15:31:48] Ardesco: it's a JS heavy app though
[15:32:05] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: what version of Firefox?
[15:32:07] adamgoucher: simon and alister had a back/forth on slow ie and it was cus of screenshots
[15:32:14] Ardesco: 16 on the CI server
[15:32:25] AutomatedTester: and Alister still got it wrong in his blog post
[15:32:27] Ardesco: not updated to 17 yet after hearing about various issues
[15:33:03] Ardesco: app i'm working on is using the google maps API and rendering polygons on top of it with JS
[15:33:11] Ardesco: IE just has issues with it really
[15:33:25] adamgoucher: AutomatedTester: heh. whoops. ignore that then...
[15:33:47] Ardesco: the stuff that slows IE down is all the hover checks
[15:33:57] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: speak to Jim more about it
[15:34:03] Ardesco: check that tooltips appear on SVG graphs on hover
[15:34:04] davehunt has joined #selenium
[15:34:19] Ardesco: hovering over polygons
[15:34:20] Ardesco: etc
[15:34:48] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: if you find weird handling of isDisplayed around SVG can you let me know?
[15:35:14] Ardesco: not yet i haven't
[15:35:22] CarlJokl: I don't think I use FireFox anymore except for Selenium
[15:35:26] Ardesco: working fine in Firefox, Chrome, IE and Safari
[15:35:33] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: ok cool
[15:35:33] dawagner: AutomatedTester: IIRC someone here is working on some SVG fixes in firefox
[15:35:37] Ardesco: (you don't want to see my nasty Safari mouse hack)
[15:35:47] dawagner: What problems are you looking for?
[15:35:59] AutomatedTester: dawagner: I have heard rumours of issues with svg
[15:36:03] AutomatedTester: mainly around isDisplayed
[15:36:27] Ardesco: issues I have had with SVG are using non css locators

[15:37:13] Ardesco: but generally not too bad once we worked it all out
[15:37:26] dawagner: Aah, the thing I was thinking about has already been pushed to the atoms
[15:37:44] AutomatedTester: dawagner: the OSS atoms or Google atoms?
[15:37:52] dawagner: They're the same ;)
[15:38:28] AutomatedTester: dawagner: which is the conical reference?
[15:38:43] AutomatedTester: for Googlers
[15:38:51] AutomatedTester: thats what I meant
[15:39:31] dawagner: Generally we make changes to the ones in Google because we can trivially test all of the browsers.  We're aiming to get every change pushed to open source within 24 hours.
[15:39:47] dawagner: (We've been bad about that in the past, but I've put a lot of work in to making syncing easy, recently)
[15:40:16] AutomatedTester: thats awesome
[15:40:41] AutomatedTester: its not a bad thing they get out of sync as long as we can limit the time they are out of sync
[15:40:48] dawagner: Indeed
[15:41:48] AutomatedTester: dawagner: can you fix CMD+arrow keys in gmail? It overrides the default behaviour and makes me angry
[15:43:03] Ardesco: seems i lied
[15:43:07] Ardesco: IE taking 34 mins
[15:43:14] AutomatedTester: FF 10 mins?
[15:43:16] CarlJokl: Hmm
[15:43:42] Ardesco: yup
[15:43:56] Ardesco: chrome is 10 mins as well single threaded
[15:43:56] CarlJokl: It looks like searching for: org.openqa.selenium.android.intents.IntentSender is now showing in a location more consistent with the repository I have so I will investigate further.
[15:44:37] dawagner: AutomatedTester: Come fix it yourself
[15:44:40] Ardesco: FF doesn't seem able to select anything from an auto complete drop down unless it has focus so not working multi threaded
[15:44:51] Ardesco: we haven't worked out why yet
[15:44:58] AutomatedTester: dawagner: that means I have to work in London
[15:45:01] AutomatedTester: London is smelly
[15:45:02] dawagner: AutomatedTester: Any idea what's going on with the focusmanager?
[15:45:13] AutomatedTester: dawagner: no but Marionette doesnt suffer from it
[15:45:19] dawagner: Ardesco: It's a long-standing firefox problem ;)
[15:45:28] dawagner: Woo! When can we actually use that thing?
[15:45:48] AutomatedTester: I have agreement in principle to get it into opt-builds
[15:45:59] dawagner: Woo!
[15:46:02] AutomatedTester: just need to do the code that was agreed on
[15:46:19] AutomatedTester: well for desktop that is
[15:46:23] AutomatedTester: mobile might be harder
[15:46:34] AutomatedTester: but we have a way forward at least
[15:47:38] Ardesco: in that case I won't try to find a way around it
[15:47:46] Ardesco: 10 mins isn't bad tbh
[15:48:07] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: it will be a while till we get it usable for Selenium users
[15:48:14] AutomatedTester: we are still having stability issues
[15:48:20] AutomatedTester: plus missing features
[15:49:11] CarlJokl: Bits of London are smelly such as underpasses but it isn't all smelly.
[15:49:31] AutomatedTester: CarlJokl: I am only joking ;)
[15:49:48] CarlJokl: I gathered, maybe I just like arguing
[15:50:05] AutomatedTester: maybe you do...
[15:50:10] Ardesco: we ca still run 3 sets of firefox tests in the time it takes to run IE9

[16:02:38] AutomatedTester: or just css?

[16:02:44] adamgoucher: Marks: what you want to do is create MarksWebDriver which inherits from WebDriver and add your bits there
[16:02:50] barancev: in various operations -- findChildElement, sendKeysToElement, setAlertValue
[16:02:53] Ardesco: The code on that blog post will allow you to get the url of the file you want to download, you could then wget it directly from source
[16:03:09] ql6wlld1: llaskin: in chrome that works fine, just ff doesn't
[16:04:21] ql6wlld1: (tried ff16.02, native events, none native in windows and linux (fedora, if that makes a difference).  Selenium 2.26, ruby.
[16:04:33] llaskin: ql6wlld1: yes i am using 2.26 and ruby in ff16.02
[16:04:47] barancev: I thought the issue is in atoms, but JS tests are green in FF17, so it should be in FF-specific code

[16:07:08] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: intellij works well with Android
[16:07:19] Marks: well i am using WebDriver exclusively, and RC is what i am calling Server component (includes webdriver and selenium i am using ony webdriver) as opposed to client

[16:07:23] adamgoucher: dawagner: (and when teaching, the last thing you want is any sort of magic code completion -- thats useful afterwards)
[16:07:46] dawagner: I disagree - code completion can make discovering how to do things much, much easier

[16:26:55] dawagner: CarlJokl: I can't see IntentSender anywhere
[16:27:04] dawagner: adamgoucher: I believe it should Just Work, why?
[16:27:11] dawagner: CarlJokl: It's a wrapper around rake
[16:27:16] dawagner: And a bit magical
[16:27:23] dawagner: Our build system is being rewritten to be more sane :)
[16:27:39] dawagner: Basically, the build.desc files are what define the build
[16:27:47] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: works well iirc

[16:28:02] adamgoucher: dawagner: $client's machines are ridiculously restricted. feel like i should not just be upgrading system bits willy nilly
[16:28:04] CarlJokl: The problem for me is. If I could look at the build script it might help me see how the AndroidWebDriver.apk file is built
[16:28:07] ql6wlld1: actually, if I have my mouse in the ff window it does correctly change the css style on move_to, but then if I move the mouse pointer you see it does the hover off and back on again in like a few frames
[16:28:15] CarlJokl: From there I would know which components it needs

[16:30:41] ql6wlld1: do the native events like move_to require your mouse cursor to be in the FF window to work? and after you have activated a move_to, do you need to tell it to move out the element before it will consider the cursor to be elsewhere?

[19:59:04] Manoj: Hi all
[19:59:18] Manoj: A quick question on Page Object Pattern.
[19:59:57] Manoj: Can any other pattern in Gof 23 patterns can be reffered to as page object pattern.
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Nov 23 20:00:25 2012]
[20:00:25] Manoj: i meant the other design patterns like facade, factory, proxy, etc....
[20:00:35] Manoj: which can be similar to page object pattern
[20:01:13] Dude-X_: page object pattern has nothing to do with GOF patterns
[20:02:00] Manoj: i understand, but in general if we consider the working of the design, can any other design pattern simlar to Page object ?
[20:03:06] Manoj: our page object  - separation between test code and page specific code such as locators
[20:04:10] Manoj: it actually encapsulates those details and shows only the initilization stuffs in the actual Script.
[20:04:45] Manoj: keeping these concepts in mind, can we compare with some other design patterns. If yes which design pattern can match the best ?
[20:04:54] Manoj: i hope i am clear in the question.
[20:05:01] barancev: what's the intention?
[20:05:51] Manoj: intention is just for learning purpose as well as provide a solution to test automaton probelms using this template. http://st-www.cs.illinois.edu/patterns/Writing/GOFtempl.html
[20:06:02] Manoj: with our page object pattern.
[20:06:33] barancev: a page object is a kind of proxy
[20:07:54] barancev: page objects are created by a factory (not a one described by GoF, but a factory -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(software_concept) )
[20:09:00] barancev: some people use singleton pages
[20:10:44] Manoj: Alright, so the close exmaple that we can say is the Singleton Pattern.
[20:11:36] barancev: I said "some people", and it's nothing to page objects, just a (wrong?) way to use them
[20:11:59] Manoj: ok
[20:13:07] barancev: close patterns are prox and factory (in general sense)
[20:13:27] Manoj: i am not well versed in all other patterns, may be some developers here may relate the concept of page objects to the other common Design Patterns and say some patterns that are close enough.
[20:13:49] Manoj: yes, right i was thinking about the proxy now.

[20:17:02] Manoj: Thanks for the immediate discussion on this.
[20:18:36] barancev: as a result error object could not be converted to json, and selenium never got error messages from the browser
[20:19:36] barancev: AutomatedTester: btw, it there a specification of the stacktrace format?

[21:48:59] Ardesco: well thats not strictly full screen
[21:49:07] Ardesco: but sets the browser to the size of the desktop
[21:51:06] Zack: driver.manage().window().maximize();  trying now

[21:52:41] Ardesco: sorry Zack , driver.manage().window().maximize()
[21:53:52] Ardesco: or you can use a desired capability
[21:54:08] Ardesco: DesiredCapabilities caps = DesiredCapabilities.chrome();
[21:54:08] Ardesco:                     caps.setCapability("chrome.switches", Arrays.asList("--start-maximized"))
[21:54:29] Ardesco: and do a new ChromeDriver(caps)
[21:54:50] Zack: tried that one.  I even tried it with —kiosk 
[21:55:13] Zack: kiosk actually worked but locked my screen completely. 
[21:55:21] Zack: —start-maximized did nothing 
[21:55:49] Ardesco: strange that neither works
[21:56:00] Zack: they are considered depreciated methods now
[21:56:26] Zack: I wish chrome could just use F11 like the rest
[21:56:30] Zack: the driver at least..
[21:56:50] Ardesco: maximise isn't deprecated
[21:58:36] Zack: maybe it doesn't work with chromedriver?
[21:58:40] Zack: idk lol
[21:58:43] Zack: Its not working though

[22:06:19] Ardesco: oops mixing doubles and ints

[22:07:16] Ardesco: in fact the syntax may be slightly different, i'm using groovy atm
[22:07:35] Ardesco: so it's probably getDefaultToolkit and getScreenSize etc
