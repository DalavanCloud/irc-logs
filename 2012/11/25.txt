[20:38:08] dawagner has joined #selenium
[20:38:25] dawagner: detronizator: yt?
[20:38:31] detronizator: yes
[20:38:56] dawagner: Is the intention to mv third_party/java/ghostdriver third_party/java/phantomjs-driver ?
[20:39:24] detronizator: yes
[20:39:32] detronizator: I think I might have phrased that poorly
[20:39:32] detronizator: :)
[20:39:35] dawagner: Awesome, will apply :)
[20:39:44] detronizator: thanks :)
[20:39:54] detronizator: is the reasoning behind this clear?
[20:40:15] farlan has joined #selenium
[20:40:18] dawagner: Yep, I just wanted to check before deleting files :)
[20:40:37] detronizator: ;)
[20:42:19] detronizator: it's awesome to reach a 1.0.0... but also very scary
[20:42:26] detronizator: I'm sure I'll get TONS of bug reports
[20:42:37] detronizator: some actionable, some completely bollocks
[20:42:38] detronizator: :)
[20:42:39] dawagner: That's half the fun!
[20:42:54] dawagner: The more bollocks they are, the more successful you can consider yourself to have been
[20:43:03] detronizator: LOL
[20:43:18] dawagner: Aah first build of selenium on new laptop? /me waits for gecko to download
[20:44:54] detronizator: pretty fast
[20:45:10] detronizator: I didn't measure, but was something like 10/15min
[20:45:15] jarib: dawagner: new laptop is always nice though!
[20:45:27] detronizator: but I might be wrong: I walked away to get coffee and was done when back :)
[20:45:55] dawagner: Indeed :) Although retina has more negatives than positives for me so far...
[20:46:05] detronizator: why is that?
[20:46:07] freynaud: dawagner: how so ?
[20:46:12] detronizator: the screen is gorgeous
[20:46:20] dawagner: A lot of apps look shitty because they're low-res relative to the screen
[20:46:20] detronizator: and works pretty great next to my Dell 24"
[20:46:33] dawagner: Some apps are great, but e.g. firefox looks like shit
[20:46:52] detronizator: dawagner: Apple had advertised the need to make their UI "proportional" and not "abs pixeled" long time ago.
[20:47:04] dawagner: (Aside: The spike java reimplementation of crazy-fun worked out pretty well, so simon's going to re-write it nicely, but fundamentally our build should be parallelised soon)
[20:47:17] jarib: very cool
[20:47:31] detronizator: dawagner: super cool!
[20:47:50] detronizator: just remember to push up the heap mem size
[20:48:06] detronizator: surely it will require more now
[20:48:23] dawagner: detronizator: What name do you go by in commits?
[20:49:27] detronizator: I think on Google Code I'm "detronizator". Let me check.
[20:49:30] detronizator: yep
[20:49:34] detronizator: "detronizator"
[20:49:39] detronizator: or "detronizator@gmail.com"
[20:49:41] detronizator: any of the 2

[20:52:22] dawagner: Woo!
[20:52:36] dawagner: Congrats on getting there!
[20:52:42] detronizator: I better rewrite the README file now :)
[20:54:53] detronizator: dawagner: thanks dude! You guys have all been very supportive and that helped immensely. Particularly jimevans: he has done so much by debugging, providing patches and even rewriting the keyboard input code! 
[20:55:19] detronizator: I have contributed in my life to 2/3 projects, but this is BY FAR the best community around it.
[20:55:28] detronizator: #Hugs & #Kisses :)
[20:56:30] dawagner: Are you coming to the selenium meetup on Tuesday?
[20:57:12] detronizator: yes
[20:57:26] detronizator: really looking forward to it. I supposed the timing of this is right :)
[20:57:58] detronizator: I don't know if you have Lightning Talks or stuff like that, but if you do I want to say a few words about this experience so far.
[20:59:06] detronizator: dawagner: ^
[IRC logfile - Started Sun Nov 25 21:01:30 2012]
[21:01:30] dawagner: I think this one is a little different because we're doing a workshoppy kind of thing rather than a talk thing
[21:01:53] dawagner: But I'm sure we could find 5-10 minutes for a quick lightning talk (and definitely a full talk slot at a future meetup!)
[21:02:09] dawagner: (That said, I'm not organising this; check with davehunt + zac_sel :))

[21:03:33] detronizator: and I'd highlight *free*: usually those things are paid a lot with contractors and stuff.
[21:03:38] detronizator: so, it's going to be fun

[21:37:32] dawagner: That's better than I've ever managed with the emulator
[21:37:49] dawagner: But last time I ran the tests on a device, there were ~3 failures
[21:38:17] dawagner: If I can work out where my phone is, I'll try kicking off a run...
[21:41:09] farlan has joined #selenium
[21:41:28] dawagner: Found it!
[21:41:54] dawagner: And now to install the SDK...
[21:44:48] dawagner: Anyone: Is there a magical target to run the tests on-device?
[21:47:40] dawagner: /java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/android:on-device-test:run is the one
[21:49:42] dawagner: Of course it doesn't work...
[21:50:14] adamgoucher: ChildrenFindingTest seems to have issues on android when you run it. of course, the individual methods don't work it seems.
[21:50:36] adamgoucher: erm, individual test methods /do/ work. but when chained like that things get honky

[22:02:48] dawagner: adamgoucher: Did you make any local changes to get the thing working?
[22:02:55] dawagner: (Or are you using the prebuild version?)
[22:03:39] adamgoucher: i started the emulator before; i couldnt get crazyfun to launch it
[22:04:05] adamgoucher: the abi that crazyfun wants is x86 but i had armv7 or similar
[22:04:33] adamgoucher: i also updated third_party/java/android to be android-17.jar

[22:06:21] dawagner: Yeah, I did that, but on the phone...
[22:06:27] dawagner: I'll try cleaning and rebuilding
[22:10:02] adamgoucher: hrm. is there a magic crazyfun flag to run things non-parallel?
[22:10:28] adamgoucher: (as in, is the android server smart enough to do parallel commands?)
[22:10:44] dawagner: Nothing is smart enough to do parallel commands
[22:10:57] dawagner: (Unless I've misunderstood the question)
[22:12:47] adamgoucher: blech. a little consistency would be nice https://gist.github.com/4145683
[22:12:50] dawagner: Did you definitely actually build a new apk?
[22:13:45] adamgoucher: yes. well, i did a ./go clean android and installed ~/selenium/selenium-2.26.0/build/android/android-server.apk into the emulator
[22:14:28] dawagner: But did it actually make a new apk, rather than copying the prebuild one?
[22:14:48] *adamgoucher goes to make another build to pay closer attention
[22:15:46] dawagner: As best I can tell, the class it can't find *was* compiled in to the apk :S
[22:16:39] adamgoucher: server_very_core.jar cracks me up
[22:19:59] adamgoucher: BUILD SUCCESSFUL

[22:25:36] *adamgoucher is being optimistic on the naming...
[22:25:39] dawagner: This shouldn't be working for you.  I've found a missing dependency for one thing
[22:25:56] adamgoucher: was it added post 2.26?

[22:26:27] adamgoucher: mine is built from /tags/2.26.0 not /trunk
[22:26:29] dawagner: Aah ok :)
[22:26:53] adamgoucher: figured doing it from trunk would cause me all sorts of grief what to call it
[22:27:53] dawagner: Oh you know what? This could be a chrome vs android browser problem.
[22:29:41] adamgoucher: isnt the server done as a webview and not a chromewebview? (switches windows…)
[22:30:23] dawagner: I believe at some point, on real devices, the default WebView implementation was swapped out to be backed by Chrome
[22:30:36] adamgoucher: as of 4.1 i believe
[22:30:40] *dawagner gives up
[22:31:33] adamgoucher: you would /think/ though that switching implementations out would cause things to fail in a consistent manner though
[22:31:49] dawagner: It fails consistently for me ;)
[22:32:15] dawagner: It gets as far as creating the webview (white screen), but never gets as far as getting
[22:33:13] dawagner: I'd grab my Xoom, but it's packed at the bottom of a box
