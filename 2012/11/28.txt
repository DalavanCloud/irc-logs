[02:04:50] selbot2: 03james.h.evans.jr@gmail.com less than a minute ago - JimEvans: Adding new capability "enableElementCacheCleanup" to the IE driver. When set to true, the IE driver will clean the known-element cache of invalid elements after every page load. This is intended to keep memory usage down and improve performance. However, it is an intrusive change, so this capability is provided temporarily to allow disabling this behavior ...
[02:04:51] selbot2: ... if problems arise. The default of this new capability is "true", meaning this behavior is turned on by default. | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=18215 | http://seleniumhq.org/ci.jsp?r=18215

[08:50:15] solofight_: rp2: proxy server and ?
[08:50:21] solofight_: write a script there to watch the download ?
[08:50:26] stephend: HAR
[08:50:29] rp2: and of you kill the browser, how would you reuse it?
[08:50:39] stephend: we tried it, didnt' finish it in IE, but I think it worked for firefox?
[08:50:50] rp2: of->if
[08:50:50] solofight_: stephend: HAR ?
[08:51:04] stephend: https://github.com/davehunt/pytest-mozwebqa/tree/proxy
[08:51:04] solofight_: rp2: i do not want to kill the browser
[08:51:17] rp2: can you open multiple browser windows or tabs in Selenium? I haven't tried that yet
[08:51:20] stephend: yes, .har files
[08:51:40] stephend: http://www.speedawarenessmonth.com/what-is-a-har-file-and-what-do-i-use-it-for/
[08:51:57] solofight_: stephend: damn - the app that am dealing with does not work in firefox :(
[08:52:00] solofight_: only on ie and chrome
[08:52:10] stephend: ah
[08:52:13] stephend: sorry :-(
[08:52:25] solofight_: stephend: thanks for your knowledge share
[08:52:42] stephend: np!
[08:52:49] rp2: solofight_: so what is it you want to test? you wrote 'the browser gets killed'
[08:53:20] solofight_: can i make the browser instance stay - like even when the script finished executing. This way the next time i can do a check whether its open or not and execute the script in it without opening a new instance of the browser
[08:54:43] solofight_: rp2: i want to test the download function of the application. Presently the script initiates the download (which is the last step of the script) and once the execution is done the browser gets closed irrespective of the file is downloaded or not
[08:56:19] solofight_: because the browser gets closed like that - the file download gets cancelled
[08:56:19] solofight_: so i was thinking if i can make the browser stay opened irrespective of script execution is starting or finished

[09:00:13] solofight_: Ardesco: link blocked by firewall :(
[09:00:26] Ardesco: blah sucky firewall
[09:00:41] solofight_: Ardesco: it says i should not download using selenium is it ?
[09:01:49] Ardesco: it questions why you are using selenium to download, tells you that you shouldn't do it unless you are doing some sort of test on the file that is downloaded (managing to download something but not knowing what it is is a pointless test) and then gives you a way to do downloads sensibly in Java so that you can test the downloaded file
[09:02:42] Ardesco: the code is all here
[09:02:43] Ardesco: https://github.com/Ardesco/Powder-Monkey/tree/master/src/main/java/com/lazerycode/selenium/filedownloader
[09:05:13] solofight_: Ardesco: am using selenium as a automation tool here - i exactly know what goes in and what comes out as the download file - its just a matter of removing the manual intervention here
[09:05:21] solofight_: you still think i should not do it ?
[09:06:00] Ardesco: i think you should only download a file if you are then going to do some tests on that file
[09:06:31] Ardesco: physically downloading a file is something that browsers do when a web server serves up a file
[09:06:46] Ardesco: by clicking on download and something being downloaded you are not testing your website
[09:06:56] Ardesco: you are testing that the browser is capable of downloading files
[09:07:33] Ardesco: I'm positive the browser vendors have already checked that works and in a much more complete way than you can :)
[09:10:47] rp2: Ardesco: love the article!
[09:10:56] teodosia_sel has joined #selenium
[09:11:02] Ardesco: \o/
[09:12:25] rp2: however I'm very doubtful that you can really reduce download testing to link checking. especially at non-tech end user level, there is a *huge* difference between 'the link can be clicked' and 'it works, I can see the document'
[09:12:27] rbalent has joined #selenium
[09:13:08] rp2: browser configurations can come into play, etc.
[09:15:55] freynaud: rp2: "non-tech end user"  using automation is a risk. He might not understand what he actually test.
[09:16:03] rp2: but the 'whoa, take a step back' message hits home ...
[09:16:28] rp2: freynaud: no, I mean, you probably need to test the non-tech user's experience
[09:17:17] freynaud: rp2: true, but that's not browser automation anymore.
[09:17:22] rp2: and downloading is notorious for generating problems
[09:18:29] freynaud: rp2: you can always over engineer you automated tests to include download testing, but that's so linked to what software in installed on the machine that you won't have a "real user" exp anyway
[09:18:31] rp2: well, it's not browser automation, but the average Jane and Joe won't understand that when they ask you to automate the browser tests
[09:18:49] rp2: you may be right.
[09:19:27] freynaud: rp2: that's why I don't explain the details. I say : that part is tested, the result is Go/No Go. If you want to know more, join the test team :)
[09:19:59] rp2: in any case, if you're going to automate it, it will have to be in a separate little corner that uses OS-specific technology rather than Selenium
[09:20:21] freynaud: rp2: for windows, you can use twin.
[09:20:25] rp2: twin?
[09:20:50] freynaud: http://code.google.com/p/twin/
[09:20:54] rp2: hmm ... nice
[09:21:14] rp2: will it port to X?
[09:21:39] freynaud: no, it relies on the microsoft UIAutomation framwork
[09:21:40] freynaud: k
[09:22:35] freynaud: http://code.google.com/p/twin/wiki/Recipes - check the attach strategy. You can attach yourself to a process, so you can start IE / FF with web driver, attach to it, and use twin when the download menu appear.

[11:29:19] stan: I seem to remember with selenium rc you could pass a session id to the client object class create to reuse an existing started browser .  Is the same possible with webdriver?
[11:32:02] solofight_: i even shifted the wait to the testing portion instead of the teardown and still it wont work
[11:32:25] adamgoucher: solofight_: the quit() is not a 'wait for something in the dom via polling' event. its just a 'see this object? no you dont...'
[11:33:04] solofight_: adamgoucher: so how do i make the browser quit delay by x number seconds ? no way ?
[11:33:37] adamgoucher: stan just use the same driver object, and don't kill it at the end of one script
[11:33:48] adamgoucher: solofight_: time.sleep(n)
[11:33:49] solofight_: thanks for replying by the way

[11:52:17] adamgoucher: ?
[11:53:19] adamgoucher: you cannot attach to a browser that was not launched by webdriver. but the session is stored internally as a guid so just swap out the session and you should be good. and/or rethink how you spawn/destroy browsers in your runs

[13:06:39] barancev: downgrade to FF16
[13:07:02] rath_: so it's a known problem?!
[13:07:10] adamgoucher: AutomatedTester ya, i mean more in terms of how we market the android solution -- sounds like there isnt an android solution anymore. there are browser vendor provided means to drive their browser on android
[13:07:23] barancev: rath_: yes, it will be fixed in 2.27
[13:07:32] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: yes

[13:28:12] adamgoucher: meanwhile… android continues to download.
[13:28:15] barancev: adamgoucher: no. use reflection to load classes
[13:28:55] adamgoucher: so there is such a thing, but the way is reflection … <goes to ddg to figure that out>

[13:33:32] barancev: for simple cases just use Class.forName(....) to load the class
[13:34:11] barancev: it will load the required class with the "current" class loader
[13:34:47] adamgoucher: the issue is i think that the android platform comes with 4.0 or something of org.apache.httpclient whereas webdriver uses 4.2. need to trick the compiler into using 'ours' instead of 'theirs'

[14:47:41] Ardesco: as to link checking question earlier
[14:47:49] Ardesco: well statement really
[14:48:02] Ardesco: link checking is only valid if you want to know something is downloadable
[14:48:10] rp2: not even statement really
[14:48:11] Ardesco: so if a link gives a 200OK
[14:48:32] Ardesco: checking that is the same as clicking download and then never looking at the file you download
[14:48:44] rp2: well ...
[14:48:45] Ardesco: if you want to actually check the file by all means download it
[14:49:04] Ardesco: the blog entry was more along the lines of only download if you intend to do something with it
[14:49:17] rp2: arguably, the point of using Selenium is to test at the browser level rather than the HTTP level
[14:49:19] Ardesco: if not you may as well link check because that's all you are really doing
[14:50:40] rp2: yes ... for me its  main point point is: there probably isn't much you want to test between checking the link and going beyond what Selenium can do
[14:51:35] Ardesco: well there probably is, it's just that most people don't.  They assume that if clicking on a link downloads something it must be fine
[14:51:37] alexglow has joined #selenium
[14:51:56] Ardesco: some may go as far as checking the filename, but in reality a filename doesn't mean anything
[14:52:05] rp2: but I can imagine exceptions (e.g. testing on poor connections to find out whether interrupted downloads are a problem
[14:52:07] rp2: )
[14:52:40] Ardesco: in that case you would still want to do something that enables you to get and check the file
[14:52:53] Ardesco: rather than just clicking and assuming that what  has been downloaded is golden
[14:53:55] RossPatterson: Just for arguments' sake, we actually have functional download tests.  Part of our product is a library of downloadable file, and part of the checking is metadata like the the MIME type of the file.  And you can't check that from inside the browser.
[14:54:02] danqa_ has joined #selenium
[14:54:40] RossPatterson: Since the MIM types (etc.) are configurable in the application, it's a valid test of important function.  But it has to be done using a directly-accessible HTTP client.
[14:58:11] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[14:59:45] RossPatterson: "testing on poor connections" - Stuff like that tends to be hard to simulate.  It's a good idea, but if you're doing stuff that sophisticated, you're way ahead of the crowd.

[16:02:56] jarib: configuring big dependency graph of test / build / deployment for a SOA system with bamboo is a huge PITA

[16:05:04] AutomatedTester: s/then/them
[16:05:05] jarib: i'd like something that is (a) able to visualize the dependency graph and (b) configured with text files in version control
[16:05:25] jarib: i'd rather write the tool tbh :)
[16:05:45] AutomatedTester: jarib: so what you want is Travis-CI with the deploy part?
[16:06:06] jarib: bamboo is fine for SCM and running commands
[16:06:28] jarib: but e.g. a given integration test run may require X applications to be running
[16:07:04] jarib: if those apps failed to build, deploy or start, there's no point in running those tests 
[16:07:38] jarib: so i'd like a way to configure that, with text files
[16:07:58] jarib: (so that it can be tracked in version control)
[16:08:59] jarib: i guess it's sort of like any build tool, but with non-local dependencies
[16:09:49] jarib: i.e. you can depend on "app X is running with version Y on machine Z"
[16:10:54] jarib: any suggestions for how to do this? :)

[16:20:42] jimevans: there's a test in SlowPageLoadingTest that is failing for i-don't-know-why
[16:20:51] jarib: yeah, the issue isn't whether to stop if a step fails (that's what i want), but bamboo just is not the right tool for configuring that list of steps in a system with semi-complex dependencies

[21:35:40] AutomatedTester: knorrium: yt?
[21:35:51] knorrium: AutomatedTester: hey
[21:36:28] AutomatedTester: hey, would you be able to help with the following query "wondering if you know anybody at yahoo (specifically y! mail) who does selenium testing, we're trying to automate a login to reset some test account properties across runs"
[21:36:54] AutomatedTester: its from a Mozilla team
[21:37:37] AutomatedTester: knorrium: ^
[21:38:07] knorrium: what do they need? a special way to login? a whitelisted account that won't be flagged as spam?
[21:39:16] knorrium: afaik some scripts use an internal login procedure and some use the public login page
[21:39:57] knorrium: i've had some problems in the past where the ads would not finish loading so selenium couldn't start filling the username and password fields
[21:41:16] AutomatedTester: knorrium: would it be ok to email you with more of the details
[21:41:31] AutomatedTester: and perhaps we discuss the best approach?
[21:41:43] knorrium: sure
[21:42:45] AutomatedTester: knorrium: I a) dont want to be seen as spammers b) not use selenium where need be and solve problems in between

[22:26:57] jimevans: :note dawagner also, find-by-xpath using the class attribute works fine in the atoms itself, it's in the compiled case where things go haywire.
[22:26:58] selbot2: ok!
[22:31:55] AutomatedTester: yay for opt bugs
[22:34:12] jimevans: i'd really like to get this ie driver bug fixed before 2.27.
[22:34:47] jimevans: i suppose i could just back out the changes to atoms.h. that'd solve that problem. :)
[22:35:09] jimevans: has anyone heard from eranm at all in the last while?
[22:35:14] jimevans: :seen eranm
[22:35:15] selbot2: eranm was last seen 2 days ago, quitting.
[22:35:41] AutomatedTester: jimevans: in my email to the dev list today I cc'ed him individually to hopefully get his attention
[22:35:54] jimevans: ah. i hadn't noticed that. thanks for that.
[22:36:42] *AutomatedTester emails people like I would want them to email me
[22:37:32] jimevans: i wonder if this isn't a closure compiler bug.
[22:42:17] plightbo: does anyone ever get "seen" last NOT quitting?
[22:42:31] lukeis: :seen plightbo
[22:42:31] selbot2: plightbo was last seen less than 20 seconds ago, saying 'does anyone ever get "seen" last NOT quitting?'.
[22:42:33] lukeis: :)
[22:42:47] plightbo: well that's stupid, who is going to do that command when the person is in the chat room :P
[22:43:01] lukeis: for those who *always* lurk

[22:43:05] selbot2: krosenvold was last seen 4 days ago, joining.

[22:44:42] AutomatedTester: detronizator now understands git isnt always the answer
[22:44:51] AutomatedTester: i win
[22:44:55] detronizator: AutomatedTester: LOL
[22:45:12] detronizator: very mature
[22:45:13] detronizator: :P
[22:45:40] AutomatedTester: I didnt add "nah nah nah nah" at the end of I win
[22:45:43] AutomatedTester: that makes me mature
[22:45:48] detronizator: AutomatedTester: true
[22:45:55] detronizator: LOL
[22:46:00] lukeis: detronizator: just wanted to say, window.alert should never be used either… not a time in the world i want a web page to 'interrupt' me… that's what push notifications to my phone are for ;)
[22:46:22] AutomatedTester: you know when you think you understand cookies
[22:46:36] AutomatedTester: your employer goes and changes the rules on cookie jars
[22:46:41] jimevans: lukeis: yeah, but it's not as evil as frames. :)
[22:46:51] lukeis: true dat
[22:46:51] *jimevans baits lukeis into a rant
[22:46:58] lukeis: :-D
[22:47:27] detronizator: lukeis: I disagree. There are "modal scenarios". Extreme scenarios where, while it's annoying (not saying they are not), not alerting can cause worse.
[22:47:29] *lukeis would rather rant about irresponsible programs not flushing their output buffers
[22:47:42] jimevans: s/programs/programmers/
[22:47:51] detronizator: lukeis: quick example - I'm working on modelling the experience for the mobile customers using 1-click for video purchase.
[22:47:53] jimevans: lukeis: fixed it for you
[22:47:57] lukeis: thx ;)
[22:48:26] detronizator: lukeis: we need them to be aware of what the fuck it's going on. And, if something went wrong, make sure we stop them to say "DUDE - read this shit out!"
[22:48:44] detronizator: it's money we are dealing with.
[22:48:46] lukeis: can still be done in the UI without window.alert
[22:49:11] *lukeis has coded that many a times
[22:49:19] lukeis: (without window.alert)
[22:50:19] detronizator: lukeis: I think the native modal window.alert() it's effective and I hate to see something that Alert could do, done with other things. Maybe it's just me, but I prefer to spend time to invent NEW stuff, not reinventing the exact same thing, but that looks "cooler"
[22:51:05] lukeis: meh, the 'cooler' alert was invented nearly 10 years ago… i've only re-skinned it as needed over time
[22:51:20] *AutomatedTester saw this round thing and then went to go invent the wheel
[22:51:57] jimevans: :note dawagner last one, i promise. i've pretty much confirmed that the problem is caused by the updated closure compiler. will be happy to chat more about it when we're both online.
[22:51:58] selbot2: ok!
[22:52:18] *lukeis saw AutomatedTester's wheel and went to go invent a bicycle ;)

[22:54:01] barancev: a javascript question (related to WDBS)
[22:54:21] AutomatedTester: what is WDBS
[22:54:30] AutomatedTester: is it WebDriverBullShit?
[22:54:40] *lukeis thinks WDBS should be re-written to translate to straight WD commands rather than the crazy JS that is does
[22:54:42] barancev: joking... we still support it
[22:55:02] AutomatedTester: barancev: we still support it in Java
[22:55:12] barancev: it does WD commands whenever possible
[22:55:17] lukeis: not really
[22:55:37] barancev: well, a question is inspired by WDBS, but it is about javascript and WD
[22:56:01] barancev: we set window.__webdriverConfirms = [] to hold confirmations
[22:56:04] AutomatedTester: sorry, barancev whats is the question
[22:56:12] barancev: then we do driver.click()
[22:56:17] AutomatedTester: argg, comma in the wrong place
[22:56:42] barancev: and after the click window.__webdriverConfirms is equal to null - why?
[22:56:59] barancev: I thought window is a global object
[22:57:17] detronizator has joined #selenium
[22:57:22] barancev: why it missed a property after driver.click()
[22:57:25] barancev: ?
[22:57:41] lukeis: and it's not touched by the atom?
[22:57:57] barancev: by webdriver atoms? I hope NO
[22:58:54] AutomatedTester: barancev: what does the click do?
[22:59:03] barancev: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/internal/seleniumemulation/Click.java
[22:59:13] barancev: it is very straightforward
[22:59:20] barancev: just a call to WD click
[22:59:26] AutomatedTester: I mean in the test
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Nov 28 23:00:10 2012]
[23:00:10] barancev: it clicks a link that opens a confirmation box and then opens a new page
[23:00:39] AutomatedTester: so is it empty before or after the confirmation box?
[23:02:22] barancev: before driver.click() it is [] (empty array), after driver.click() it is null
[23:03:13] AutomatedTester: so when you are on the new page?
[23:03:29] jleyba has joined #selenium
[23:03:30] barancev: yes, on a new page this property becomes null
[23:05:06] Zack has left #selenium
[23:05:33] barancev: due to this issue WDBS has no support for alerts and confirmations
[23:06:18] barancev: they disappear after arrival to a new page after a click
[23:06:49] plightbo has joined #selenium
[23:07:43] lukeis: if it's on a new page of course it will be null / undefined… the code using that should assume that to happen and treat it like []
[23:08:23] barancev: lukeis: why it is undefined on a new page? who clear it? the browser?
[23:08:37] lukeis: yeah, a new page is a brand new window object
[23:08:44] barancev: windows object is global, it is the same, no?
[23:08:49] lukeis: it's only global in the scope of the page
[23:08:54] barancev: document is new, windows is the same
[23:08:57] lukeis: no, not the same
[23:09:02] lukeis: window is new
[23:09:11] lukeis: too*
[23:09:27] barancev: is there something really global?
[23:09:31] lukeis: localStorage / sessionStorage is the only global thing
[23:09:36] barancev: to pass data between pages?
[23:09:40] lukeis: that ^
[23:09:50] lukeis: or cookies ;)
[23:09:59] barancev: :google MDN window localStorage
[23:10:00] selbot2: DOM Storage - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Storage

[23:10:31] selbot2: window - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window
[23:11:17] barancev: is it FF-specific?
[23:11:20] lukeis: no
[23:11:37] lukeis: but there is a problem, cross-site sandboxing there
[23:12:03] lukeis: this stuff sounds like it needs to be kept inside the FF plugin
[23:13:10] lukeis: but if it's WDBS then it should be stored 'client' side
[23:14:29] barancev: lemme check...
[23:19:38] AutomatedTester: waves
[23:21:13] barancev: "Keep in mind that everything you store in any of the storages described in this page is converted to string using its .toString method before being stored"
[23:21:24] detronizator: :note jimevans Hey Jim, is the GhostDriver .Net binding going to be "made public" in release 2.27?
[23:21:25] selbot2: ok!
[23:21:48] lukeis: detronizator: i can answer that, yes it will be
[23:22:00] detronizator: lukeis: lovely
[23:22:03] lukeis: same with python
[23:22:06] lukeis: and java
[23:22:07] barancev: but there is no phantomjs release yet
[23:22:11] lukeis: everything in trunk goes ;)
[23:22:18] lukeis: nope
[23:22:24] lukeis: but you can build from master :)
[23:22:39] barancev: no, sir! I'll wait
[23:22:41] detronizator: ah - so the Python bindings are in too? that's ACE!
[23:22:50] lukeis: yeah, been in for a while
[23:22:52] lukeis: ;)
[23:23:07] detronizator: lukeis: missed that. You wrote it?
[23:23:07] lukeis: and even updated to use the --webdriver flag
[23:23:12] lukeis: yep
[23:23:19] detronizator: lukeis: kiss on the forhead

[23:23:44] detronizator: lukeis: do you have an "official URL" you'd like to be referred to in a post I'm writing?
[23:23:54] lukeis: nope :)
[23:24:05] lukeis: lukeis suffices for me :)
[23:24:26] detronizator: nothing? not a twitter handle? or a github account? (so that I can also follow you on github :))
[23:24:36] lukeis: i have both of those i suppose

[23:26:57] lukeis: heh
[23:27:00] lukeis: that's my daughter

[23:27:56] lukeis: she was being a stinker in the photo… why i like it ;)
[23:28:11] jleyba: wow.  Safari 6 has a "Prevent search engine from providing suggestions" privacy option
[23:28:21] lukeis: nice :)
[23:29:07] jleyba: Meh.  Safari's only good for working on the SafariDriver and using a browser that's flash free
[23:29:21] plightbo: I still use Safari!
[23:29:42] lukeis: i have co-workers who use it primarily… i personally don't
[23:29:44] plightbo: I like it because of the swipe-to-navigate gestures and the double-tap-to-zoom gesture
[23:30:03] plightbo: but Chrome is still faster, I just accept a slightly slower browser for the sweet sweet gestures :)
[23:30:19] lukeis: swipe navigation works on chrome too
[23:30:26] jleyba: Chrome is getting slower. They're shoving so much cruft in there now
[23:30:37] jleyba: Really wish they hadn't bundled flash
[23:31:07] jleyba: Anyway, anyone know how to turn off the pop-up blocker in Safari 6.   Apple's done a really good job hiding the option
[23:32:20] jleyba: nvm, I'm blind
