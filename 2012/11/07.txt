[11:08:38] solofight: people i want to attach a file on the mail compose page of gmail. THe problem is that the file attachment loader is not a normal input = file box but a flash loader
[11:08:58] solofight: followed this thread http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8842340/how-to-automated-gmail-to-send-email-by-using-selenium/13268693#13268693
[11:09:12] solofight: and i get this error [error] Element css=.LIODqc not found
[11:09:29] solofight: i dont know how it works for them and not for me. any ideas to debug ?
[11:16:07] davehunt: solofight: I would suggest that unless you work for Google and are testing GMail itself, then you should avoid trying to automate the UI
[11:16:57] solofight: davehunt: am not working for google and definitely not testing gmail. How else to achieve this behavior ?
[11:17:06] solofight: davehunt: and thanks for replying
[11:18:05] davehunt: solofight: it depends on what you're trying to do. if you want to automate sending emails with attachments, there are many ways to do that without going through the pain of automating a changing UI
[11:18:06] barancev: solofight: use SMTP to send email. and POP3/IMAP to receive email

[12:20:28] rdk: I will write a code to get onload confirm
[12:20:42] Ardesco: if I hover over an element it seems to flicker the hover and then go away almost instantly
[12:21:26] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: I *think* that might be the hover persistence bug
[12:21:37] AutomatedTester: there is something in the issue tracker about it

[12:21:50] *Ardesco goes to look at issue tracker

[12:23:48] AutomatedTester: no, my employers browser this time
[12:23:57] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: well, its the older versions
[12:23:59] barancev: but flickering in FF is something new
[12:24:23] Ardesco: IE seems to get there if i fire a mouse event twice
[12:24:30] Ardesco: and don't use actions
[12:24:56] Ardesco: so this usually works in IE for me:
[12:24:56] Ardesco: mouse.mouseMove(((Locatable) elementToHoverOver).coordinates)
[12:24:57] Ardesco:         mouse.mouseMove(((Locatable) elementToHoverOver).coordinates, hoverPoint, 0)
[12:25:08] Ardesco: move once, then again with coordinates
[12:25:37] Ardesco: and have enablePersistantHover set to false in desired caps
[12:25:51] Ardesco: chrome is the bugger
[12:26:07] Ardesco: i need to fire a mouseoverevent before hovering or it doesn't work
[12:26:11] Ardesco: no idea why
[12:26:30] Ardesco: generally all fine on OSX, it's windows that is giving me problems

[14:28:19] nimeacuerdo: it looks like clicking virtual box vm window
[14:29:04] nimeacuerdo: seems to affect the point where my tests try to move to some element (moveto) so it becomes visible and then click on it
[14:30:14] nimeacuerdo: like if the fact that I have clicked the virtual box vm window when the test is about to start
[14:30:34] nimeacuerdo: so the mouse is now in the vm

[16:06:40] intchanter-work: I won't take this far afield.  I'll just say that democracy isn't the goal.
[16:06:58] intchanter-work: Democracy does not imply freedom.
[16:07:52] AutomatedTester: and Socialism doesnt imply the loss of freedom
[16:08:37] intchanter-work: Correct.  Only if socialism is backed by force.
[16:10:59] AutomatedTester: what do you mean backed by force?
[16:11:53] intchanter-work: I mean penalties beyond non-participation for not wanting to participate in a particular implementation.
[16:12:46] intchanter-work: If you get to choose how much you donate and for what causes, you can have socialist structures without loss of freedom.  If resources are allocated without your choice, you can't have freedom.

[16:17:19] intchanter-work: On topic: I have some tests that were running under FF10 on CentOS 6 and started with Jenkins.  The tests were working until we needed to upgrade to FF16 for other reasons.  It appears that the system-installed selenium is older, and it was starting FF but only a blank window and then timing out.

[16:18:03] AutomatedTester: intchanter-work: whats in the error console of the browser?
[16:18:07] intchanter-work: The Jenkins plugins comes with 2.25 standalone, but if I have that running without the system one, it fails to launch the browser.
[16:18:43] intchanter-work: Currently there isn't any.
[16:18:58] intchanter-work: I can try turning the system thing back on.  How would I capture that?
[16:19:47] intchanter-work: Actually, that doesn't work either.  Because the plugin is already started, the system service fails to bind to :4444
[16:22:28] intchanter-work: So I can either get an admin to upgrade the system copy of Selenium or troubleshoot why the Jenkins plugin isn't starting a session.
[16:23:35] AutomatedTester: intchanter-work: can you see if something is already running on that port
[16:24:02] intchanter-work: It's the Jenkins-selenium plugin.
[16:24:17] intchanter-work: Which runs selenium-2.25-standalone.jar.
[16:24:52] intchanter-work: Er, selenium-server-standalone-2.25.0.jar
[16:25:35] AutomatedTester: so when that runs the browser launches but nothing else happens?

Specificallyl I'm receiving "Unable to connect to remote server...No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it" errors for every test across Chrome, IE, and Firefox drivers.
[20:07:21] cori[s]1: What's odd, though is that I have test class start up code that logins in to the site I'm testing that runs for each browser, and that code runs perfectly; opens the web driver and logs in, but the first FindElement() that's hit in the actual test code triggers the exception.
[20:07:37] cori[s]1: s/logins in/logs in/
[20:09:44] cori[s]1: looking at the output of the test run, I see, for example, that the Chrome Driver starts up on port 60282, for example, but then the test code fails to be able to connect to that port.
