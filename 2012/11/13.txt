[14:58:32] jimevans: we don't "maximize" the window, we purposefully resize it to the size of the current page's DOM, since screenshots in webdriver are defined to be full-page.
[14:58:34] dude-x: that IE scans/sends the whole DOM to take a screenshot?

[15:10:59] AutomatedTester: what is our stance on supporting cygwin?
[15:11:05] jleyba has joined #selenium
[15:12:46] dude-x: i always see cygwin as a bash that has access to windows programs
[15:13:01] dude-x: if you try to use it as a unix inside windows, it will only end in tears
[15:13:09] davehunt has joined #selenium
[15:13:19] AutomatedTester: someone has raised bugs because python correctly thinks its on windows
[15:13:32] AutomatedTester: but cygwin doesnt have the windows libraries
[15:13:32] dude-x: and that's the way it works
[15:13:52] eranm: Is somebody using the Python bindings from within cygwin on Windows?
[15:14:04] AutomatedTester: eranm: yea
[15:14:32] AutomatedTester: and raising bugs because of unhandled errors because its going to the windows paths but not getting the windows exceptions
[15:14:45] eranm: Good luck? There's very little else to say.
[15:15:03] eranm: It's a very non-standard environment.

[15:27:29] WSelenium has joined #selenium
[15:28:12] WSelenium: Hi all question about the new Selenium 2.26, for the IE driver, is the IE server now required in order to run IE?
[15:28:33] WSelenium: or is there still a way to run IE without starting an IEserver
[15:28:39] jimevans: WSelenium: yes. and has been for several releases now.
[15:28:53] jimevans: the executable is required.
[15:29:17] WSelenium: hmm.. ok it wasn't needed in 2.25 which is why I ask, was able to run IE without an IEServer running
[15:29:51] *jimevans raises eyebrows in surprise
[15:30:05] jimevans: really? without using a capability to force the use of the legacy internal server?
[15:30:18] jimevans: in what language?
[15:30:33] WSelenium: probably have the capability to force it, and java was it let me check
[15:30:49] eranm has joined #selenium
[15:31:03] WSelenium: yeah was using a capability to force it, that function I'm guessing is no longer available?
[15:31:10] jimevans: nope.
[15:31:43] jimevans: the standalone executable has been available for months. imo, there's been ample time for people to migrate to using it.
[15:32:31] jimevans: what's your resistance to using the standalone executable?
[15:33:38] WSelenium: mine was based off the chrome server, when ever I ran tests and if they botched or so, I'd have like 50 chrome servers running
[15:34:20] jlopez has joined #selenium
[15:34:58] dude-x: 50 chrome servers? don't you need only one running?
[15:34:59] dude-x: nmm
[15:35:01] dude-x: hmm
[15:35:41] WSelenium: it will start it up when the chrome driver starts per run of the java code, since I'm not manually starting them.  I doubt I'm explaining or convaying what happen with 100% clarity
[15:35:42] jimevans: WSelenium: so i take it you don't have a proper "if it craps out, call driver.quit()" method somewhere.
[15:36:16] WSelenium: the problem happens when the browser is lost
[15:36:37] jimevans: WSelenium: i don't understand that. can you explain it?
[15:36:48] jimevans: what does "browser is lost" mean?
[15:37:11] WSelenium: in my java code when the browser has an issue, 9/10 it will quit correctly
[15:37:35] WSelenium: every so often I'll get an error from selenium stating the browser has been lost and the driver will be throwing nulls on any calls after that
[15:38:42] intchanter-work1 has joined #selenium

[15:50:56] simonstewart: In The New Crazy Fun, we walk the build files one at a time
[15:51:14] simonstewart: starting from the ones specified by the target given on the command line and reading dependencies
[15:51:30] simonstewart: Those dependencies are given in the form of "Labels"

[15:51:42] simonstewart: )

[15:52:16] simonstewart: (and there's tons of them! :)
[15:52:28] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: selbot replies automatically to PM
[15:52:31] AutomatedTester: :)
[15:52:34] jimevans: simonstewart: selbot might be smart enough to figure that out and reply in a PM
[15:52:38] simonstewart: Nice
[15:52:44] jimevans: d'oh! AutomatedTester beat me to it!
[15:52:46] simonstewart: Glad it does that :)
[15:52:56] simonstewart: Each label can be thought of as a pointer to a Target
[15:53:09] dude-x: selbot just blackmailed me…. :O
[15:53:13] simonstewart: (the actual information held in the "java_library" bits)
[15:53:33] simonstewart: As we read each target, we register it with a "build coordinator"
[15:53:50] simonstewart: At the time of registration, we can't dereference the targets
[15:53:58] simonstewart: Because they might not have been read yet
[15:54:19] simonstewart: However, when we get to the build, we really do need to dereference things
[15:54:24] simonstewart: So, there are two choices:
[15:54:38] simonstewart: Targets should not have "Labels" listed as their dependencies, but other Targets
[15:54:49] nhirata has joined #selenium
[15:55:06] simonstewart: (which intuitively feels "right", but leads to complications in that we can't send a Target to the server until we've read each dependency)
[15:55:24] simonstewart: Or, we keep Labels in Targets and "somehow" dereference them when doing a build
[15:55:47] simonstewart: On the client-side, we do that on demand via a "BuildFiles" class.
[15:56:15] simonstewart: Hmmm… I guess we could do something similar on the server side
[15:56:21] simonstewart: But using the cached results of lookups
[15:56:35] simonstewart: Does that sound sane?
[15:57:59] dawagner: Being able to shard the analysis of the dep graph is useful, so just passing around labels, and having whatever processes them know how to translate them in to targets feels useful
[15:58:17] simonstewart: Yeah, that's why I built it this way in the first place
[15:58:32] dawagner: Sounds sane :)
[15:58:37] AutomatedTester: sounds sane to me
[15:58:49] simonstewart: Is there a simpler way to do it?

[16:00:21] AutomatedTester: tbh, dont know
[16:01:14] simonstewart: Heh. That's what I was afraid of
[16:01:20] simonstewart: Right. Let's hack this thing together
[16:01:34] dawagner: So this all comes from being lazy, right?
[16:01:41] darkrift: AutomatedTester: If you get questions about the selenium jenkins plugin, forward them to the jenkins user list please
[16:01:42] simonstewart: Right
[16:01:45] dawagner: We don't know the target for the label because we're lazily evaluating
[16:01:47] dawagner: We could not be lazy
[16:01:50] AutomatedTester: darkrift: ok
[16:01:56] dawagner: After all, we're going to need to do the loading Pretty Soon anyway
[16:01:59] darkrift: (that if I'm not here)
[16:02:26] simonstewart: dawagner: but if we're being lazy and we find a target with no deps, we could build it before finishing parsing all the build.desc files
[16:02:45] darkrift: AutomatedTester: thanks
[16:02:45] simonstewart: For an incremental build, we _might_ see some nice speed ups
[16:03:09] simonstewart: (For reference, this is how I think we'll be doing a build: https://code.google.com/p/crazy-fun/source/browse/src/com/googlecode/crazyfun/Build.java?name=new_world#46)

[19:51:18] *AutomatedTester thinks its 3d vs 2d issue
[19:52:02] barancev: a moment, it fails in getTransformValues with exception
[19:52:20] barancev: input for this function is         transform    "translateY(-10000px)"    String
[19:52:53] barancev: it's value of  transform local var
[19:53:31] barancev: (debugging testElementWithTransformIsReallyHidden)
[19:53:47] AutomatedTester: matrix value is translateY(-1000px) ?
[19:54:16] barancev: yes, it's no way matrix, but it is so
[19:54:38] AutomatedTester: wtf IE

[20:53:25] barancev: jimevans: what's the current status of GhostDriver?
[20:54:34] chrisculver701 has joined #selenium
[20:55:03] jimevans: barancev: close. detronizator would be the right person to ask, but there are only a couple of housekeeping things to do to integrate the code into the phantomjs core code.
[20:55:33] jimevans: we still need to figure out a java bindings distribution mechanism, but we're going to discuss that with simonstewart.
[20:55:49] barancev: right
[20:56:00] barancev: I'd prefer it be like opera and chrome
[20:56:18] jimevans: in what sense? they're not the same.
[20:56:45] jimevans: opera provides a .jar that webdriver consumes and repackages. chrome is a local part of webdriver.
[20:56:50] barancev: a small starter in the selenium distribution, and externalized main part
[20:56:54] jimevans: (from a client-bindings perspective)
[20:57:29] barancev: well, I use maven, for me Opera is an external dependency
[20:58:30] jimevans: i'm very much removed from the discussion of where the java bindings code lives. .net will have a phantomjsdriver class delivered as part of the webdriver .net bindings.
[20:59:50] barancev: that's what I mean "like opera and chrome" -- we have operadriver and chromedriver in selenium code base, but not the whole implementation, just a launcher
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Nov 13 21:00:28 2012]
[21:00:28] lukeis: we should have the same in my opinion (launcher code) in Se code base
[21:00:36] lukeis: that's all ghostdriver code is
[21:01:09] lukeis: but that has been rebuffed even and they want the launcher code external
[21:01:37] jimevans: but that's just it, the opera launcher code isn't even internal. it's provided as part of the third_party folder, as part of the opera .jar.
[21:01:58] jimevans: and *that's* where the discussion is to be.
[21:02:39] lukeis: i thought this was discussed / decided? :)

[21:10:42] AutomatedTester: but you're fixing that right barancev?

[21:19:38] *lukeis has spent a little too much 'work' time on this over the last couple days
[21:20:04] AutomatedTester: this is work
[21:20:19] lukeis: if only it was paying me :)
[21:24:07] lukeis: awkward… been sitting in silence with my headphones on for the past hour(?)
[21:24:27] barancev: interesting is that in Firefox driver.close() is non-blocking
[21:25:05] bfife: shot in the dark, but can anyone think of a program that can characterize js objects (parent/child relationships) in a bunch of js files?
[21:26:13] barancev: one can call a method after close (e.g. driver.getWindowHandle()) and it returns a result, but a second later the same operation throws an exception
[21:30:14] barancev: bad news is that it is UnreachableBrowserException exception, I'd expect to catch SessionTerminatedException
[21:30:33] barancev: if it was the last window
[21:31:16] barancev: though.. other browsers throw generic WebDriverException, not much better
[21:32:05] jleyba: barancev: getWindowHandle should throw NoSuchWindowException if the window has been clsoed
[21:32:55] barancev: jleyba: unless it was the last window, I made a rectification
[21:33:26] jleyba: barancev: yeah, that's an implementation detail of Firefox and Safari on windows
[21:33:33] jleyba: since closing the last window kills the process
[21:34:13] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[21:34:37] barancev: interesting was that close is async - you can call a method after closing the browsers last window, and it returns a result
