[03:40:13] LeeBreisacher: hi. I'm sortof new to Selenium (well, I used it several years ago). I've set up a very simple java junit test that uses WebDriver to open Firefox. 
[03:40:37] LeeBreisacher: it works ok, but takes quite a long time to open the FF browser. is that normal? 
[03:40:49] LeeBreisacher: it's like 30 seconds. 
[03:42:05] adamgoucher: shouldnt
[03:42:13] LeeBreisacher: any suggestions?
[03:42:33] adamgoucher: what else is your script doing?
[03:42:37] LeeBreisacher: I'm just doing 
[03:42:37] LeeBreisacher: 		driver = new FirefoxDriver();
[03:42:49] LeeBreisacher: and
[03:42:49] LeeBreisacher: driver.get
[03:42:53] LeeBreisacher: with an ordinary url
[03:43:02] adamgoucher: and its just the driver command that is taking forever?
[03:43:08] LeeBreisacher: yes
[03:43:20] LeeBreisacher: the .get
[03:43:29] adamgoucher: ff 16 or 17?
[03:43:55] LeeBreisacher: 17
[03:44:06] adamgoucher: downgrade to 16; some known bugs with 17
[03:44:51] LeeBreisacher: wow. ok. or I could try Chrome..
[03:47:59] adamgoucher: 2.27.0 should be out early next week to fix it
[03:51:08] LeeBreisacher: thanks!

[13:39:14] ArSn: awesome
[13:39:28] AutomatedTester: there is a Firefox release we are waiting on
[13:39:36] AutomatedTester: and a few minor fixes we need to add
[13:39:43] ArSn: alright
[13:39:45] AutomatedTester: then chocks away
[13:39:50] ArSn: FF17 is exactly why I'm asking
[13:39:55] AutomatedTester: yea
[13:39:56] samphippen has joined #selenium
[13:40:00] AutomatedTester: that fix is in already
[13:40:06] ArSn: it really drove me nuts when I noticed it yesterday
[13:41:05] AutomatedTester: soz
[13:41:21] AutomatedTester: its not a Firefox issue, we have some magic code for error handling

[13:42:26] ArSn: I would have believed that
[13:42:27] ArSn: ;)
[13:43:08] AutomatedTester: we use regex to parse messages coming back from Firefox
[13:43:46] AutomatedTester: which means we are very susceptible to minor changes in error message formats
[13:44:48] *AutomatedTester points out that his rewrite of FirefoxDriver doesnt have these problems
[13:46:16] AutomatedTester: crazy question: if I do driver.executeScript("return window.top;") what would expect back?

[15:14:10] Ardesco: *both
[15:14:19] Ardesco: rolled back to current release
[15:14:31] jimevans: what are the symptoms?
[15:14:51] Ardesco: hover is triggered
[15:15:08] Ardesco: but the dog that should appear on hover flickers up and disappears instantly
[15:15:12] Ardesco: and then doesn't come bacjk

[15:16:17] Ardesco: currently making all our failing tests work on IE8
[15:16:22] Ardesco: and it sucks exceptionally hard

[15:19:23] adamgoucher: nope. i juist put the ff17 thing in the topic
[15:20:26] jimevans: adamgoucher: ah. thanks for that.
[15:22:38] jimevans: Ardesco: by the by, the latest IEDriverServer *should* handle alerts on <select> onchange, and <form> on submit.
[15:22:53] jimevans: at least on anything up to windows 8.

[15:24:38] Ardesco: i'm not seeing any focus issues with ie
[15:24:41] jimevans: Dave_B: does the window actually have focus? not that "on top" and "having focus" are not synonymous.
[15:24:58] Dave_B: When launched it doesn't have focus, not sure how to give it focus though
[15:24:59] jimevans: s/not/note/

[15:26:09] Ardesco: using 2.26.2 here and not seeing that problem
[15:26:28] Dave_B: hmmm, actually i've got several versions around the palce, might jsut check to make sure it is using the one I think its using!
[15:26:32] Dave_B: *place

[17:21:39] rmcauley: jarib: the problem I'm having is that I use se2 from within cucumber
[17:22:03] rmcauley: at the end of tests I clean up open browsers using at_exit(), which works fine for everything except chrome
[17:22:24] rmcauley: it seems se2 closes the connection to chromedriver before I can close the browsers?

[17:34:50] jarib: rmcauley: so is CukeSe.rb:128 an exit hook that tries to take a screenshot?
[17:34:56] rmcauley: yes
[17:35:41] jarib: so it's not cleaning up browsers
[17:36:03] rmcauley: Yes
[17:36:26] rmcauley: I think what's happening is that in webdriver/chrome/service.rb, it's calling Platform.exit_hook { stop }
[17:36:38] rmcauley: And at_exit will execute that before it executes /my/ exit hook
[17:36:54] jarib: yes
[17:37:02] jarib: you need to register your hook before launching the browser
[17:37:18] rmcauley: The troublesome part there is that I /do/
[17:38:27] rmcauley: my at_exit is registered after Cucumber loads itself, and before any browsers are opened by the test units/scenarios.
[17:38:41] rmcauley: (but my at_exit is registered after a require selenium-webdriver)
[17:40:00] jarib: hmm. try moving it until after the browser is launched and see what happens?
[17:40:27] rmcauley: Oh at_exit gets done in reverse order...

[19:25:53] plightbo: though i was goofing around with Play Framework 2 last night... kind of cool
[19:25:55] simonstewart: C'mere
[19:25:59] AutomatedTester: s/these days//

[19:26:07] simonstewart: I'll give you a big hug when we meet up

[19:26:41] nirvdrum: plightbo: Scala or Java?
[19:28:27] lukeis: oh, simonstewart and plightbo are talking at the same time, must remember to remind about Sehq dns stuffs (don't worry, this shouldn't require coding of any kind!)
[19:28:40] simonstewart: I've a heavy admin day
[19:28:40] plightbo: nirvdrum: Java, I'm not THAT cool
[19:28:47] simonstewart: plightbo has sent out emails
[19:28:49] simonstewart: I need to read them
[19:28:58] plightbo: lukeis: I got Simon all the DNS info, so it's all his fault now

[19:49:20] dude-x: indoors?
[19:49:24] dude-x: i eat ice cream during the winter
[19:49:31] adamgoucher: thats the best time to eat it; you can take you time then
[19:49:50] rpereira has joined #selenium
[19:53:35] dude-x: during hurricane Sandy, I bought a pint of ice cream for preparation
[19:53:41] dude-x: that's it
[19:53:58] Zack1: ha
[19:54:16] lukeis: that's it? only a pint? … shoulda gone for the half gallon ;)
[19:54:35] AutomatedTester: you're in the US, I thought they only sold it at the gallon
[19:54:46] dude-x: half gallon is the biggest size
[19:54:50] lukeis: eh, they have pint's too
[19:54:54] AutomatedTester: in the US
[19:54:57] AutomatedTester: really
[19:55:00] AutomatedTester: only that
[19:55:11] AutomatedTester: i bet they have bigger in Texas
[19:55:24] lukeis: usually they have one or two in the gallon size
[19:55:24] dude-x: Edy's is one of the few brands that sells gallon ice cream
[19:55:54] *lukeis prefers a stockpile of it's it's though ;)
[19:56:03] dude-x: Haagen Dacz is sold as pints in 99% of grocery/supermarkets
[19:56:15] *adamgoucher is resisting the urge to ask 'whats the pint of that little portion of ice cream'
[19:56:19] lukeis: so is ben&jerry's
[19:56:31] dude-x: but i dislike ben & jerry's flavors
[19:56:39] dude-x: all i taste is chemical weirdness
[19:58:01] *lukeis can't buy haagen daz without upsetting the wife over the whole nestle boycott
[19:58:11] dude-x: nestle owns them :(
[19:58:14] lukeis: yep
[19:58:33] dude-x: ugh…. and they're from the bronx
[19:58:49] lukeis: nestle owns dreyers which does haagen dazs ;)
[19:58:56] dude-x: i guess that would make their milk suspect
[19:59:35] dude-x: but haagenz dacz seems to have the best flavor of the commercial ice creams 
[19:59:58] dude-x: lukeis: so if you're banned from Haagen Dacz what is your alternative?

[20:03:41] adamgoucher: geez jimevans. you go to the baseball games around a perfect game, missing the artisial ice cream… :)
[20:03:56] jimevans: yeah, i suck.
[20:03:57] *adamgoucher should note that he has yet to get to a giants game, so...
[20:04:31] *adamgoucher further notes that the oakland coliseum is nowhere as nice. <what a pit>
[20:04:47] lukeis: heh :)
[20:04:57] lukeis: don't worry… they'll be out of there soon
[20:05:26] davehunt has joined #selenium
[20:05:58] adamgoucher: the coliseum makes skydome look awesome
[20:06:25] lukeis: the only plus it has is the convenient location next to bart
[20:06:42] jleyba: the coliseum can't help it - it's in oakland
[20:07:41] jleyba: the A's wanted to build a new stadium down in Fremont.  Away from any kind of public transit.  (thankfully that got shot down real fast)
[20:08:53] adamgoucher: isnt the rumor now cupertino or similar (south/west end of the bay) where the money
[20:09:00] adamgoucher: is (but also in sf territory)
[20:09:11] jleyba: not sure.  the 49ers are moving to santa clara
[20:10:24] adamgoucher: feh. football. :D
[20:10:36] lukeis: they should just suck it up and stay there… send the raiders back to LA and convert the coliseum into just a baseball stadium ;)
[20:11:01] jimevans: adamgoucher: that's the rumor (san jose was last i'd heard), but the giants would have to agree to it, which has about a snowball's chance of happening.
[20:12:10] jleyba: alright, I need the power of the hive mind.  is there any way besides window.postMessage to communicate with a frame that belongs to another domain?
[20:12:16] rp2: I'm starting to doubt my choice of TestNG ...
[20:12:25] jleyba: java = junit
[20:12:36] rp2: JUnit is even more limited, isn't it?
[20:12:40] jleyba: Junit4
[20:12:40] *lukeis <3 TestNG
[20:13:18] rp2: JUnit seems to assume that the code I want to test is Java classes under my fingers.
[20:13:34] rp2: well, it's not, I'm using Selenium.
[20:13:37] *jleyba ranks TestNG somewhere below SeleniumRC in terms of usefulness
[20:14:12] stan has joined #selenium
[20:14:15] lukeis: jleyba: only other way I know / have hacked around with is a handshake with *yet another* frame that is the same domain of the window.top, the the other domain frame sets the src to
[20:14:16] jleyba: rp2: not at all. only assumption JUnit makes is you are using setUp-test-tearDown paradigm. and even that can be changed
[20:14:20] rp2: TestNG has all kinds of limitaations I didn't anticipate
[20:14:25] rp2: I think I want a TestNGNG
[20:14:48] rp2: perhaps I should have a closer look at JUnit
[20:14:59] rp2: now that I know about TestNG's limitaations
[20:15:03] jleyba: rp2: seriously, take a look at junit 4.  dive past the vanilla stuff and look into building custom runners
[20:15:08] rp2: what is it with this double a?
[20:15:31] *AutomatedTester ranks java somewhere below jleyba's rank of testng
[20:15:52] lukeis: rp2: what limitations are you hitting?
[20:15:53] rbalent has joined #selenium
[20:16:12] jleyba: lukeis: in the SafariDriver, frame A needs to send a message to frame B telling it to activate itself (after a switchTo().frame() commands).  Neither of them may be window.top
[20:16:29] rp2: I can achieve what I want with TestNG, no doubt
[20:16:51] rp2: well, the standard reporting doesn't seem to run parametrized tests very well
[20:17:15] lukeis: jleyba: ah… are you embeded js code in frame B?
[20:17:44] rp2: I have a test class with a couple of @Test methods
[20:18:20] rp2: now I want to parametrize them with two parameters: WebDriver to use and base URL to use
[20:18:59] rp2: reporting doesn't really support that, it mixes the test results together
[20:19:23] rp2: I know I can write my own reporters and listeners but I was hoping to use something out of the box
[20:19:28] jleyba: lukeis: yes
[20:20:12] lukeis: is frame A a parent of frame B?
[20:20:26] rp2: are there any intermediate frames?
[20:20:46] jlistf has joined #selenium
[20:21:00] lukeis: you could update frame B location after the hash #  and have your JS poll the location for changes
[20:23:11] nacho has joined #selenium
[20:23:14] jleyba: lukeis: yes, A will always be an immediate parent of B
[20:23:21] lukeis: but then again any site doing that practice may be messed (assuming you're talking SafariDriver)
[20:24:02] jleyba: yeah, problem i'm having now is the MessageEvents generated by the SafariDriver interfere with pages that listen for those types of events
[20:24:19] lukeis: yeah :-/

[20:24:58] lukeis: (what françois is doing for the ios-driver)

[20:25:14] jleyba: b) need to support safari 5 for windows
[20:25:33] ignacio_ has joined #selenium
[20:28:32] AutomatedTester: do you really need Safari 5 support
[20:28:52] rp2: jleyba: you mean something like this: http://selenium-junit4-runner.btmatthews.com/
[20:29:54] jleyba: rp2: yeah, that's one way of doing it
[20:30:10] RossPatterson: Hey pythonistas: Is there a way to make the Python WebDriver client log the actions it performs?  I'm trying to debug something and I feel stupid adding all these C-like "print 'Made it here!'" things.
[20:30:38] jleyba: AutomatedTester: not really, but we don't support safari 6 on our test infrastructure (being OSX only and all that)
[20:30:44] adamgoucher: heh. print-for-the-win! :D
[20:31:04] *RossPatterson grumbles something about vintage-1970 languages
[20:31:21] jleyba: RossPatterson: override the core execute function that all commands go through
[20:31:33] jleyba: no idea what it is in python, just know it's in there somewhere :)
[20:31:42] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: I havent put logging in the python code
[20:31:54] jarib: jleyba: sounds insane that the debugger can't be enabled for desktop.
[20:32:13] jarib: is that true for webkit nighties as well?
[20:32:16] *AutomatedTester points out that it is Apple who created that browser

[20:32:41] jleyba: Safari != WebKit

[20:39:28] RossPatterson: In expected_conditions.presence_of_element_located(locator), what is a "locator"?  Something acceptable to the webdriver.find_element() private method that we're not supposed to use?
[20:43:02] AutomatedTester: let me look at the code
