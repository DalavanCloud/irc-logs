[00:39:27] selbot2_: ok!

[12:34:24] arex\: hi jarib
[12:34:31] SamuraiJack has joined #selenium
[12:35:25] jarib: arex\: hi!
[12:36:27] arex\: jarib: What's up?
[12:37:19] jarib: not much
[12:38:14] jarib: quiet saturday 
[12:38:22] jarib: reading 
[12:38:43] jarib: what are you up to these days?
[12:40:25] arex\: In broad terms, setting up QA/CI on a project, trying to research, decide on and implement different tools
[12:40:36] arex\: In narrow terms, trying to figure out how the hell dotCover works.
[12:41:50] jarib: i see
[12:45:11] arex\: jarib: Currently, we're running TeamCity, MSTest, dotCover, FxCop, StyleCop, Doxygen and I'm looking to add Selenium + Grid and JMeter. What do you think?
[12:46:39] jarib: i'm not familiar with the .net tools
[12:46:46] arex\: hehe :)
[12:47:04] jarib: by selenium i assume you mean webdriver
[12:47:22] jarib: which is what you should choose :)
[12:47:41] arex\: yes, the names are a bit confusing
[12:47:47] jarib: indeed
[12:48:02] arex\: i've been thinking about it as selenium 2 + selenium grid
[12:48:07] jarib: yeah
[12:48:09] arex\: but that may be incorrect
[12:48:34] jarib: selenium 2 contains two technologies/APIs, RC and WebDriver
[12:48:49] arex\: ah, selenium 1 is just rc?
[12:48:54] jarib: yeah
[12:49:20] jarib: (more or less)
[12:49:22] arex\: ok, i understand, selenium webdriver implies selenium 2 then, but is more specific
[12:49:31] jarib: right
[12:49:54] arex\: so I (c|sh)ould say selenium webdriver + selenium grid (?)
[12:50:15] jarib: yeah
[12:50:36] jarib: also, gatling looks like an interesting jmeter alternative
[12:50:42] jarib: :google gatling stress test
[12:50:44] selbot2_: Gatling Project - Stress Tool: http://gatling-tool.org/
[12:50:58] jarib: i haven't really used either though.
[12:51:07] arex\: That is very helpful! I'll look into that
[12:51:39] arex\: What is your thoughts on the appropriateness of using Selenium to get an idea of client side performance?
[12:51:56] arex\: Waiting for server, downloads, rendering etc
[12:54:06] jarib: last time i tried it was really hard to isolate from all kinds of external factors, the numbers ended up super inconsistent over time
[12:54:14] jarib: perhaps we were trying to collect too much detail
[12:55:40] arex\: jarib: Interesting. I was hoping to avoid manual testing in Firebug :P
[12:56:06] arex\: What did you end up doing?
[12:56:12] jarib: try to collect the data and see
[12:56:44] jarib: either use window.performance, or you can configure firebug to dump hars t odisk
[12:57:30] arex\: jarib: Any experience with BrowserMob Proxy?
[12:57:30] jarib: there's also yslow and its beacon URL thing - where it sends scores to a service on a page load
[12:57:49] arex\: oh, did not know about that part of ySlow, i'll look into it
[12:58:19] jarib: yeah, that'd work too, but the proxy won't give you "when did onload fire" etc.
[12:58:48] jarib: driver.executeScript("return window.performance") is probably a good start
[12:59:19] arex\: Thanks a bunch :)
[12:59:25] jarib: i think we ended up measuring page load times in production
[12:59:42] jarib: there are several tools out there that will fire an XHR when the page is loaded
[12:59:58] jarib: and we can then compare logs server side 
[IRC logfile - Started Sat Nov 17 13:00:14 2012]
[13:00:14] jarib: i think this is the one we used http://code.google.com/p/jiffy-web/
[13:00:32] jarib: not sure what the state of the art is in this space any more
[13:00:45] arex\: Monitoring in production is certainly more meaningful, but it would be good to know something about client side performance ahead of a release. Although with continuous deployment, and a rolling release I guess it wouldn't be a problem :D
[13:01:20] arex\: jarib: What are you working on nowadays?
[13:01:33] jarib: still at finn
[13:01:53] jarib: + holderdeord.no on my free time 
[13:02:07] arex\: I saw :)
[13:02:16] arex\: and technology-wise?
[13:02:36] jarib: still ruby 
[13:02:53] jarib: mostly
[13:15:47] arex\: I love the "Gatling's DSL vs JMeter's" links on the Gatling site
[13:15:59] arex\: I miss Ruby
[13:23:43] arex\: We're going to introduce git, Atlassian Stash, Atlassian Crucible and TeamCity to other teams soon, that should be exciting

[20:04:17] Dude-X_: wubino, you can create a new firefox profile object, set it up with firebug and then set up a capability that accepts that profile, then pass that capability to the remote drive
[20:08:11] wubino: got it thanks
