[08:59:53] Androidnewbe: does anyone know how i can clear cookies or histroy from the webdriver ?
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Nov  1 09:00:04 2012]
[09:00:04] Androidnewbe: in ie it keeps stroing login details
[09:02:20] girija has left #selenium
[09:06:53] andreastt: driver.manage().deleteAllCookies()
[09:07:07] andreastt: To clear history you'd have to create a new browser profile on most WebDriver implementations.
[09:07:30] andreastt: But in OperaDriver you can do driver.utils().clearPrivateData(OperaDriver.PrivateData.ALL);

[09:10:10] rbalent has joined #selenium
[09:12:19] Androidnewbe: but i am not using separate drivers because i use selenium grid 2 and it's all in one
[09:12:29] Androidnewbe: and im using ruby
[09:12:43] andreastt: Whatever you do it always calls down to an implementation.
[09:13:25] andreastt: I think the answer to your question is to start a new instance WebDriver with a fresh profile though.
[09:13:33] andreastt: You're basically moving into the domain of testing browsers instead of web apps when you want to clear history (-:

[09:15:41] andreastt: That would depend on if you reinitialize your driver instance between the tests.
[09:16:19] Androidnewbe: i beleiev i do
[09:16:48] Androidnewbe: do you want to see the code ?

[14:58:15] BubbaH57: yes sir. It isn't so much the writing of individual tests that I'm looking for at this point, as it is developing the the entire suite. What does a typical controller look like (java?) how are all the tests run and reported on, etc. I feel like I'm missing something there.
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Nov  1 15:00:40 2012]
[15:00:40] dude-x: BubbaH57: choose a test framework, either TestNG or jUnit
[15:01:11] BubbaH57: Ah, so the point it use Selenium 2 within Java testsuite?
[15:01:13] dude-x: BubbaH57: basically you will want to have 3 components to the test infrastrtcutre
[15:01:22] bfife: ^ check out how the selenium IDE exports to java/junit or java/testng
[15:01:55] adamgoucher: and then ignore that code since its not page-object-y and thats the best thing weve come up with yet for maintenance purposes
[15:02:15] bfife: hehe
[15:02:21] bfife: its good enough to get started, no?
[15:02:39] dude-x: you wiill want to have a wrapper class that will do common tasks of locating elements and waiting for elements, using the webdriver API
[15:03:04] dude-x: you will have a directory for page objects, that use this wrapper class to interact with the page
[15:03:04] softmanpetro has joined #selenium
[15:03:13] BubbaH57: Thanks. I believe the piece I was missing was where something like jUnit fits into the picture. I was working on the assumption that I should be doing everything natively in Selenium2
[15:03:18] kelt65 has joined #selenium
[15:03:28] dude-x: then you will have the tests themselves that rely on the page objects
[15:04:00] adamgoucher: selenium (webdriver) is /just/ a library just like log4j. junit does the discover/exection/reporting
[15:04:22] BubbaH57: aye .. that makes so much more sense. I suppose it should have been self evident
[15:04:29] dude-x: you can write scripts using raw selenium scripts, but that will become a headache to maintain really fst

[15:11:31] bfife: getting real tired of this work firewall blocking pastebin
[15:12:18] flyinprogramer: i'm interpreting this as  webdriver throws a request to a remote_node to click on something; and then it waits for a reply from the node and it times outâ€¦ but maybe i'm reading this wrong?
[15:12:25] bfife: do you have any env variables set?

[15:15:36] bfife: might help a bit more. you can see if it threw an exception

[16:05:47] jimevans: chrisculver701: I'd bet that's a bug in the ie driver.

[16:06:42] chrisculver701: i'll look into it more and write something up for you then
[16:07:16] jimevans: The find code was refactored when the atoms picked up wgxpath. 
[16:07:26] admc has joined #selenium
[16:07:41] chrisculver701: it is an xpath selector

[16:13:06] chrisculver701: hm
[16:13:16] chrisculver701: so should ff driver see the same exception?
[16:13:41] chrisculver701: oh wait
[16:13:42] chrisculver701: nm
[16:13:49] chrisculver701: thats the ie driver
[16:13:55] jimevans: Yep. 
[16:13:57] chrisculver701: don't they both use teh same atoms?
[16:14:20] bfife: can anyone think of a good webserver stress testing tool ?
[16:14:25] bfife: just off the top of their head
[16:14:27] chrisculver701: loadstorm
[16:14:42] jimevans: Not for xpath. Ff uses the native XPath implementation. 
[16:14:58] chrisculver701: ok
[16:15:35] chrisculver701: i thought it was interesting with the returned error. and i agree with your thoughts
[16:15:41] chrisculver701: he xpath expression '//option[text()="Initial In-State Educator's License"]' cannot be evaluated or does notresult in a WebElement
[16:16:18] chrisculver701: the "does not result in a WebElement" seems redundant with the NoSuchElementException
[16:16:36] bfife: hrm. jmeter may be what i want
[16:17:58] dude-x: bfife: ab? :p
[16:18:11] dude-x: bfife: a cloud running 1000 selenium scripts
[16:18:28] bfife: i just need something simple to see if our tomcat is choking with a few windows hitting it simultaneously
[16:18:38] bfife: i imagine it's not configured for anything near performance
[16:18:46] dude-x: you can just write a selenium scrupt that will spawn 30-40 instances of FF or chrome
[16:18:58] dude-x: and have each other user (if you're at an org) do the same
[16:19:00] bfife: ab actually might do it, but because its so js-heavy i figured having all the requests might help
[16:19:10] bfife: dude-x: can't cloud. internal webapp :/
[16:19:26] dude-x: the latter is what we did
[16:19:30] jimevans: chrisculver701: The embedded apostrophe may be throwing things off. 
[16:19:32] bfife: ^ crashing with a few windows
[16:19:48] bfife: we're gonna setup a vm host at some point to get a bunch of browsers open in a semi-partitioned way
[16:19:51] dude-x: wrote a python script using multiprocessing, and have each dev run the script on the machine to spawn 20-40 instances of Chrome
[16:20:07] bfife: chrome seems fine but firefox chokes
[16:20:20] chrisculver701: jimevans: it works if i wait just a bit and the element is found.  I have an implicit wait class for ajax loaded drop downs
[16:20:28] dude-x: it's a load test, right? you shouldn't care about browser
[16:20:41] bfife: this is also true
[16:20:46] bfife: however, chrome opens faster than ff.
[16:20:56] bfife: which is what gives creedance to its success, and ffs' not
[16:21:03] dude-x: chrome is nicer too because of faster JS execution, so you can test 'faster'
[16:21:34] chrisculver701: jimevans: i'm just adding the exception to the implicit wait helper
[16:21:35] jimevans: Ah. Then it's more likely it's a JavaScript error, maybe trying to execute the find because of the DOM's document object not being ready. 
[16:21:35] bfife: i had to override click to do an actionclick if click() throws an exception
[16:21:38] bfife: due to the framework we're using
[16:21:48] bfife: chrome thinks elements arent clickable..
[16:22:22] sassda has joined #selenium
[16:22:22] dude-x: yeah that's a downside of chrome
[16:22:28] dude-x: chromedriver is buggy
[16:23:01] jimevans: Brb. 
[16:23:04] dude-x: i don't know if google tests their code, or that they write tests in a particular way that they don't notice these issues

[18:44:19] barancev: santiycr: I can't reproduce the issue manually, the only info we have is CI -- https://saucelabs.com/jobs/ca990e65bdcc461a85ea506ec5c8f000
[18:44:50] barancev: jimevans: are you going to revert the commit tha tbroke alerts?
[18:45:20] kelt65 has joined #selenium
[18:45:37] jimevans: barancev: justify that. eranm's change fixes the window crashing issue. it solves the "enabling native events on linux" issue. the alerts problems are not reproducible outside the ci environment, nor even manually in the ci environment.
[18:46:14] barancev: without x_ignore_nofocus all tests are green, even with native events
[18:46:48] barancev: whoever can provide an example failing without this eranm's fix?
[18:47:17] jimevans: going "old skool" and having volunteers manually run the tests on local environments would show a releasable build.
[18:47:27] jimevans: or do you disagree with that assessment?
[18:48:02] barancev: jimevans: lukeis said he reproduced the issue, no?
[18:48:13] jimevans: no, not after a clean.
[18:49:49] jimevans: additionally, before r18032, native events wouldn't be enabled, even if you set the capability to do so.
[18:49:52] selbot2: 03eran.mes@gmail.com 2 days ago - EranMes: Fixing a bug with native events on Linux, when the Firfox driver was used through the Remote WebDriver server. While the Firefox driver itself determines the use of native events through a capability, the Java class that launches Firefox and loads the x_ignore_nofocus library determines whether native events are used based on a property of the FirefoxProfile object. | ...
[18:49:53] selbot2: ... https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=18032 | http://seleniumhq.org/ci.jsp?r=18032
[18:50:33] jimevans: so it's not just x_ignore_nofocus. it's fundamental to whether native events are enabled in the remote case or not.
[18:51:11] lukeis: barancev: yeah, not after a clean, could not reproduce
[18:51:27] jimevans: so, yeah, without that fix, we'd run green, because native events wouldn't be enabled in the CI environment anyway.

[18:55:24] *lukeis will help release from a conferenceâ€¦ that is after my talk which is in like 15 min
[18:56:14] jimevans: barancev: believe me, i don't like releasing from a non-green ci build anymore than anyone else, but i've waited long enough to try to get the last remaining issue fixed, which can't be reproduced anyway.

[20:05:42] dude-x: however i am using the new fixture thing for now so that seems interesting to exploit in the future

[20:07:53] AutomatedTester: dude-x: whats the issues you are seeing
[20:09:55] dude-x: how do i read a config.ini file, using py.test and then have those options available to pass into my driver and browser wrapper set up. 
[20:11:06] AutomatedTester: iirc it "just does it" for you
[20:11:33] dude-x: yeah too much magicâ€¦ I wish can bother Holger
[20:12:33] AutomatedTester: dude-x: he is hpk on freenode
[20:12:41] AutomatedTester: I can't remember his irc channel
[20:12:44] dude-x: oh he's on freenode :O
[20:13:05] AutomatedTester: when I got my new mbp I forgot the channel
[20:13:14] dude-x: is it related to pytest?
[20:13:22] dude-x: there's no channel dedicated to pytest though
[20:13:41] AutomatedTester: its dedicated to pytest but dedicated to all his libraries he releases
[20:13:53] dude-x: ahâ€¦.

[20:26:55] jimevans: AutomatedTester: I did. i meant to tell you thanks, but i've had my hands full the last couple of weeks, and it slipped my mind.
[20:27:17] AutomatedTester: jimevans: its all good, just wanted to let you know that I hadnt forgotten :)
[20:27:18] dude-x: are .net bindings for marionette?
[20:27:31] AutomatedTester: dude-x: jimevans wants to make them
[20:27:39] dude-x: cool
[20:28:59] jimevans: dude-x: yep, it's on my list.
[20:30:28] AutomatedTester: dude-x: my ideal is to have each of the bindings to speak native marionette
[20:31:08] dude-x: what protocol does it use to interact? WD json protocol? 
[20:32:55] jimevans: dude-x: a modified version thereof.
[20:34:38] jimevans: i summon thee simonstewart!

[20:37:23] jimevans: i did!
[20:37:30] chrisculver701: i thought having an ajax wait class that keeps looking for an item was an implicit wait
[20:37:31] jimevans: i'm having trouble updating the javadocs
[20:37:41] AutomatedTester: holy moly, jimevans can you summon me a latte now?
[20:37:48] jimevans: i'm getting a "command failed with status (1)"
[20:37:50] simonstewart: OK. Let me see if I can generate them here
[20:37:55] simonstewart: That'sâ€¦ suboptimal
[20:38:05] jimevans: AutomatedTester: sox mate, only one summoning per 24-hour period.
[20:38:07] simonstewart: which revision do you want me on? 
[20:38:11] simonstewart: Or is HEAD ok?

[20:40:59] simonstewart: jimevans: what AutomatedTester said
[20:41:13] simonstewart: That must have been a worry
[20:41:13] jimevans: he was displeased when the anesthesia wore off.
[20:41:28] lukeis: jimevans: sorry, internet is flaky hereâ€¦ will attempt the maven deploy if i can connect to vpn...
[20:41:38] simonstewart: maven?
[20:41:40] AutomatedTester: lukeis: I did py2.26
[20:41:49] simonstewart: lukeis: I've still got the keys
[20:41:51] lukeis: simonstewart: you doing it?
[20:41:56] simonstewart: I can do if you'd like
[20:42:01] jimevans: lukeis: no worries. i just do not have any of the prereqs set up for pushing maven.
[20:42:07] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: molar came through without any issue, only realised it happened during brushing the teeth, The Wife had never noticed it before

[20:43:12] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: you know how chilled My Boy is
[20:43:25] simonstewart: jimevans: I can build the javadocs with java6. Just need java7 to generate the official ones.
