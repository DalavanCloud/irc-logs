[03:15:02] smccarthy: thats not a good question
[03:15:05] learner_selenium: does anyone have any experience with sending events into the elements

[03:18:51] Nari115 has joined #selenium
[03:19:01] adamgoucher: the short answer for any control like that is you are going to have to make heavy use of the js executor to fire the magic bit of js at them to make them behave.
[03:19:27] learner_selenium: adamgoucher â€¦ similar to 
[03:19:55] adamgoucher: the long answer is, well, good luck with that. and try to not beat the designer too badly with a stick.
[03:20:08] learner_selenium: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5982189/cucumber-and-jstree
[03:20:35] learner_selenium: adamgoucher if you look at the answer
[03:20:47] learner_selenium: basically you are executing the javascript to make the element appear
[03:20:51] adamgoucher: yup. something like that.
[03:20:55] adamgoucher: or like https://gist.github.com/3984135
[03:21:41] adamgoucher: find the element, fire the js, beat the designer who thought standard html just wasnt good enough for them. so, the usual cycle...
[03:22:45] learner_selenium: adamgoucher, even more than that this is dynamically generated javascript , on a callback
[03:23:12] adamgoucher: yup. have fun!
[03:23:14] learner_selenium: so when i call wait.until it is unable to find the tree-grid class
[03:23:16] learner_selenium: :( 
[03:23:45] learner_selenium: so i am glad that i'm not the only one to face this bear .. i'll post an answer if i find one
[03:24:01] adamgoucher: if you create a generic class that solves the problem, make the code available somewhere for others
[03:24:27] adamgoucher: welcome to the new js widget world. just wait for canvas to really fulfill its destiny
[03:25:25] learner_selenium: lol great to see we are making strides in web dev

[12:53:45] rath_: Can't remember when and who it was, but someone told me that "WebDriverBackedSelenium" has a low priority in selenium development and I should use the WebDriver more directly, e.g. with the Actions class.
[12:55:21] rath_: does this only count for mouse interactions or also keyboard stuff? I'm trying to use this Actions class to implement a "type" command, but this class only offers me "sendKeys" which is probably not the same as "type" in "DefaultSelenium".

[14:01:40] jimevans: so back to my question, if i recall the architecture of most drivers, the element cache is kept as a property on the document. when i navigate to a new page, the element cache is gone. how does the driver make the distinction between "this is an element ID i used to know about" and "i can't find this element on the page"?
[14:01:42] Ardesco: mouse pointer is well away from the IE window
[14:01:46] freynaud: mikronaz: your cannot do what you're asking for with the default. If you really need that, then create your own grid plugn, overwrite getSession to return null if there is an IE already running
[14:02:13] dawagner: freynaud: I'm at the Google office just up the road from Mozilla at the moment, but I can head over if you're heading that way
[14:02:14] ck: there is an "admin" link, but only one Admin 
[14:02:16] jimevans: Ardesco: that's with the "persistent hover" hack that eranm introduced.
[14:02:21] ck: err, "admin" and "Admin"
[14:02:44] Ardesco: I though it was if hyou have instantiated the element you get a stale element reference exception, but if you haven't instantiated it you get an element not found 
[14:02:56] freynaud: dawagner: I'm still at home
[14:03:12] freynaud: dawagner: I can be at the mozilla office in about 2 hours I think
[14:03:26] freynaud: davehunt: are you in the office ?
[14:03:33] Ardesco: yup i have persistent hovering set to true
[14:03:45] AutomatedTester: freynaud: davehunt and I are both here
[14:03:55] Ardesco: ck maybe link text is not case sensitive after all
[14:03:59] Ardesco: (thought it would be)
[14:04:00] mikronaz: freynaud: any references on how to do that?
[14:04:08] freynaud: AutomatedTester: mind if I come earlier than the meetup
[14:04:14] AutomatedTester: freynaud: nope
[14:04:16] ck: Ardesco: should i just use the xpath or something?
[14:04:17] dawagner: Ardesco: Link text is case sensitive
[14:04:22] AutomatedTester: come when you want
[14:05:12] Ardesco: i guess we would need to see your code and html to be able to give you a definitive answer ck, I would generally suggest CSS or XPath personally (Unless it's an ID of course)
[14:05:46] dawagner: God Eclipse is ugly with retina
[14:05:52] freynaud: mikronaz: https://github.com/freynaud/grid-plugin-tutorial/wiki/Tutorial , your newSession code will be in "The new proxy code"
[14:06:13] ck: AutomatedTester: do you work for firefox?
[14:06:25] Ardesco: dawagner: use intelliJ :)
[14:06:27] AutomatedTester: ck: I work for Mozilla yes :)
[14:06:32] ck: thats what i mean!
[14:06:47] jimevans: Ardesco: at some level, there's a wire protocol call that includes a webdriver element id. at the remote (driver) end, it either knows about that id or it doesn't. if the element isn't in the cache of known elements (which should be gone after the navigation to a new page), how does it know it should return a stale element return code instead of no-such-element return code?
[14:07:09] nimeacuerdo_ has joined #selenium
[14:07:37] dawagner: jimevans: Stale element is "you passed me an internal ID I didn't know", No such element is "you passed me a locator and I couldn't find it"
[14:07:47] Ardesco: The exceptions are thrown in the client bindings though aren't they, so the client binding will know if has instantiated the object or not
[14:07:58] dawagner: The assumption is, people don't fuck with the wire protocol, so if you pass an ID, you were given that ID at some point
[14:08:11] mreedell has joined #selenium
[14:09:03] jimevans: dawagner: yeah, but that's not how the protocol is documented.
[14:09:47] jimevans: (i'm not just navel-gazing, btw. i do have a specific idea about the IE driver, but i need to resolve this semantics issue)
[14:11:13] jimevans: Ardesco: the exception thrown is entirely predicated on the response code returned by the driver via the protocol. the language bindings shouldn't be doing any work to know whether the element is valid or not.

[14:30:20] bsilverberg: AutomatedTester: When a call to selenium.get in http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py returns a 404, the resulting exception thrown by Webdriver only includes an empty message. Is that ideal?

[14:30:52] jimevans: seems like i'm missing a gecko sdk.
[14:30:55] AutomatedTester: bsilverberg: you are doing a get on that page?\
[14:31:20] bsilverberg: I am calling the get method defined in that source
[14:31:47] AutomatedTester: bsilverberg: can you phrase the question in something I can look at?
[14:32:10] AutomatedTester: what is returning a 404?
[14:32:14] AutomatedTester: what are you speaking to?
[14:32:16] AutomatedTester: what browser?
[14:32:19] AutomatedTester: what OS?
[14:32:26] adamgoucher: dawagner: are you going to start the wiki page? :)

[14:33:29] bsilverberg: I can see from the source of http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/remote/errorhandler.py _why_ this is happening.
[14:33:48] bsilverberg: I'm just not sure I am happy about it.
[14:33:57] AutomatedTester: bsilverberg: 404 isnt handled for a reason
[14:34:06] bsilverberg: That's what I'm trying to understand
[14:34:12] bsilverberg: why?
[14:34:35] AutomatedTester: because its not part of the JSON Wire Protocol
[14:35:06] AutomatedTester: those are JSON Wire error codes
[14:35:22] bsilverberg: Right, I get that.
[14:35:35] llaskin: adamgoucher: i agree with your blog, but feel its incomplete...
[14:35:38] dawagner: What do you mean by wiki page? On selenium.googlecode.com?
[14:36:05] llaskin: but am unsure what is lacking
[14:36:07] *AutomatedTester is hopping on the VPN to look at that link
[14:36:09] llaskin: jsut seems to end before it should
[14:36:48] bsilverberg: So I guess all you can do is pass through the 'value' stored in the response and for a 404 that value is empty?
[14:36:58] adamgoucher: you mean i likely got distracted by something and didnt finish a thought that never hapâ€¦.
[14:37:10] davehunt: bsilverberg: are you trying to verify that something is returning 404?
[14:37:17] AutomatedTester: bsilverberg: I cant get on the VPN so I cant see what the issue is
[14:37:25] bsilverberg: davehunt: no
[14:37:52] *davehunt clicks the link
[14:38:05] bsilverberg: AutomatedTester: sorry. I can be more specific, but it may be unnecessary. Let me try to better explain the reason I am asking.

[14:39:04] bsilverberg: A test is failing because a call to selenium.get is returning a 404. When we look at the stack trace, at the end of the failure all we see is "WebDriverException: Message: ''". This doesn't give us much info on why the test actually failed.
[14:39:11] jimevans: what. the. hell!
[14:39:13] davehunt: response = {'status': 404, 'value': ''}
[14:39:25] davehunt: bsilverberg: that's in the traceback, but I see your point
[14:39:26] bsilverberg: Yes, but that's farther up ;)
[14:39:30] AutomatedTester: bsilverberg: its because that's what I am given so return it
[14:39:30] davehunt: maybe include that in the message
[14:39:39] davehunt: :newissue perhaps?
[14:39:39] selbot2: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/entry
[14:39:51] bsilverberg: davehunt: I like that idea
[14:40:45] bsilverberg: So the fix is not about changing the error handler, but rather the component that stores the 'value' when a 404 occurs?
[14:40:56] Zack has joined #selenium
[14:41:55] davehunt: bsilverberg: so speaking to AutomatedTester this is the Selenium server responding with 404, not the result of the get command
[14:42:16] davehunt: so this shouldn't happen unless the server has died, or something equally nasty
[14:42:24] davehunt: maybe grid session handling issues
[14:42:31] davehunt: does it happen every time?
[14:42:36] bsilverberg: hmm. that _is_ interesting

[14:48:28] Hronom: Hello everyone, i have a problem... im using selenium webdriver and i need to click on menu that showed on mouse hover, so how i can do this?
[14:49:12] jimevans: Hronom: you'll want to use the Actions class (or its equivalent in whatever language binding you're using)
[14:49:14] adamgoucher: actionchain, followed by webdriver wait, followed by a click (or possibly another actionchain)
[14:49:31] Hronom: My code is Action act = builder.moveToElement( menu_element ).moveToElement( profile_element ).click( profile_element ).build();
[14:49:46] Hronom: how create wait between move and click?
[14:49:53] Hronom: its a java
[14:49:57] Zack: I'd use Locatable hoverItem and mouse.mouseMove (hoverItem.getCoordinates())
[14:50:14] jimevans: Zack: that's exactly the wrong thing to do.
[14:50:22] Zack: why is this?
[14:50:26] brokenthumbs has joined #selenium
[14:50:33] jimevans: the keyboard and mouse objects are internal implementation details.
[14:50:48] adamgoucher: you cant wait inside a set of actions, break it into steps
[14:50:58] jimevans: the actions class is the preferred way to perform advanced user interactions.
[14:51:38] jimevans: Hronom: also, you need to include a .perform() to actually do the actions.
[14:53:17] Hronom: jimevans: thanks, but i do perfom my full code is Action act = builder.moveToElement( menu_element ).moveToElement( profile_element ).click( profile_element ).build(); act.perfom();
[14:53:24] *adamgoucher thought AutomatedTester was going to write up splitting waits with an click or something in the middle. or was i supposed to do that...

[18:12:38] samphippen has joined #selenium
[18:13:19] jimevans: jleyba: i asked a question earlier today, and i think you're uniquely suited to answer it. for drivers that maintain the element cache on the document, how do they respond to attempts to use the element after a page navigation? how do they distinguish between "you're asking about an element i used to know about" vs. "you're asking about an element that i've never seen the ID for"?
[18:13:44] Ardesco has joined #selenium
[18:14:04] jimevans: the wire protocol is spec'd to return a 404 if you send an element id in the url that is invalid.
[18:15:20] jleyba: jimevans: there's wiggle room in the wire protocol
[18:15:38] jleyba: but they treat them as the same - a StaleElementReferenceError is returned
[18:16:02] jleyba: the error message would be something like "Element id not found in the cache"
[18:16:18] jimevans: well, that answers that question then.
[18:16:19] barancev|2: ok, I've found why FF17 hangs in PageLoadingTest
[18:16:38] jleyba: If I could go back in time, I'd greatly simplify the wire protocol.  Everything is a HTTP 200 with the details in the JSON response
[18:16:40] *jimevans shakes his fist at eranm
[18:17:06] jimevans: if i could go back in time, i'd use a single endpoint.

[18:20:26] jleyba: if 4xx: msg = http.body; throw UnknownError(msg)
[18:21:00] jimevans: oh, i'm sure that's true. my question actually didn't have anything to do with the protocol itself.

[20:43:12] sfbrian: adamgoucher: I hate self signed certs but the ops guys won't buy certs for all of our test domains
[20:43:40] jimevans: IE's pretty touchy about that kind of thing, and i've not done anything special to work around it in the IE driver. and by "not done anything", i mean "can't find any way to make it work nicely". patches welcome.
[20:44:06] adamgoucher: then tell your boss you cant automate with ie until they shell out the $200 for a cert. and remind them how much they pay you an hour. and where the cost benefit of fighting this really is :)
[20:44:26] sfbrian: 15 international domains + 6 QA envs = lots of certs
[20:44:29] *lukeis had luck in the past permanently accepting them on the testing boxâ€¦ unless these are the kind that will always pop up
[20:44:41] barancev: don't test over https, it's test data only nothing to protect :)
[20:45:22] sfbrian: yeah, i've argued for that too
[20:45:29] sfbrian: ops are anal
[20:45:44] adamgoucher: couldnt you have like qa.ca.eventbrite.com or something to get around it?
[20:45:47] lukeis: drop IE support in your testing then ;)
[20:46:01] sfbrian: that's the dream
[20:46:16] adamgoucher: but until thenâ€¦ you are sol :D
[20:46:31] sfbrian: the way our code works, having subdomains like that would screw things up
[20:46:35] sfbrian: hah
[20:46:54] sfbrian: good to know IE sucks as usual. I have workarounds for FF and Chrome
[20:47:10] lukeis: well, if they are holding you for ransom with certs just let your boss know that :)
[20:47:28] sfbrian: will do
[20:48:20] adamgoucher: well, its more that ie is mysterious and ms isnt helping jimevans with the driver :)

[20:49:04] jimevans: there are people inside msft who want to help!
[20:49:07] sfbrian: uh oh
[20:49:13] lukeis: had any more traction with that guy?
[20:49:29] sfbrian: Ballmer will throw down the hammer I'm sure
[20:49:35] adamgoucher: wasnt the guy who just left the uber manager that had a hate on for open source? or was that someone else?
[20:49:36] dude-x: or a chair
[20:49:36] *dude-x ducks
[20:49:58] jimevans: the msft legal department is waiting for responses from the sfc lawyers.
[20:50:08] jimevans: the ball is very much in our court at the moment.
[20:50:12] adamgoucher: ooo lawyers! :D
[20:50:14] lukeis: ah
[20:50:37] jimevans: adamgoucher: you're thinking of steve sinofsky. no, he didn't have the hate on for open-source.
[20:50:41] lukeis: yay for SFC then ;) hopefully they come through for us
[20:51:01] jimevans: full disclosure, i used to work for sinofsky (a couple of levels down, but still)

[21:00:46] dude-x: adamgoucher: since you work as a consultant, how long does it take to build page objects for a client's site that has no tests
[21:01:03] adamgoucher: 'depends'
[21:01:30] dude-x: let's say it doesn't involve fancy javascript where you have to fiddle with the executor
[21:01:33] adamgoucher: i would say the first one is done with 3 minutes .. but i only build out exactly what i need, when i need it
[21:01:49] plightbo has joined #selenium
[21:01:55] dude-x: hmm interesting approach
[21:02:03] adamgoucher: and, i use my own framework so am familiar with it, and have fairly high locator-fu
[21:02:30] stephend has joined #selenium
[21:02:38] adamgoucher: if you are writing bits of a page object you are not using now, you are wasting your time
[21:02:44] sfbrian: I wish there was a page objects example or template to go by for people just starting out
[21:03:10] lukeis: the stuff on the wiki isn't half bad
[21:03:13] adamgoucher: there isâ€¦ we just keep them secret
[21:03:24] sfbrian: lame
[21:03:29] adamgoucher: and by secret i mean in my github and mozilla's
[21:03:37] dude-x: adamgoucher: hmm i'm doing the naive approach of creating a page object for every major page, i have all the locators i care about; but i stll have to write the methods
[21:03:46] stephend: sfbrian: we have one
[21:03:57] stephend: https://github.com/mozilla/mozwebqa-test-templates
[21:04:13] lukeis: who uses python ;)
[21:04:27] stephend|mtg: heh
[21:04:31] adamgoucher: sfbrian does :)
[21:04:42] sfbrian: yay
[21:04:50] sfbrian: thanks stephend|mtg 
[21:04:50] dude-x: but I think i should just start writing tests that the team cares about to cover first  so we can have tests now rather than later
[21:04:53] stephend|mtg: np
[21:05:07] sfbrian: java sux
[21:05:12] sfbrian: python ftw
[21:05:20] adamgoucher: https://github.com/Element-34/Py.Saunter-Examples has page objects in it too. slightly different approach.
[21:05:41] *adamgoucher keeps meaning to update his page object article for the prag mag
[21:06:43] lukeis: a page object method that doesn't return something is not doing it's job IMO
[21:07:14] dude-x: sfbrian: the mozilla approach uses the raw driver and base page to interact with elements; i have a wrapper to the webdriver object so that it will handle waiting for elements and stuff
[21:07:24] sfbrian: adamgoucher: I've seen your shirts example. Our code looks more like Stephen's example
[21:07:30] stephend|mtg: yeah, we use explicit waits quite a bit
[21:07:40] stephend|mtg: we've had to, since 2.21.x, iirc?
[21:07:43] *adamgoucher thinks dude-x needs to just huge his framework :D
[21:07:51] stephend|mtg: wait_for_page_to_load changed a bit, or something
[21:08:17] adamgoucher: the ebay example needs to be updated. after some other project happens. (wheres my clone?!)
[21:08:20] dude-x: lukeis: i am not sure what to think of page objects that return themselves. not sure what's the purpose of chaining
[21:08:23] sfbrian: why not implicit wait?
[21:08:36] stephend|mtg: sfbrian: that's our first line
[21:08:46] stephend|mtg: we have slow staging servers at times :-(
[21:08:48] lukeis: dude-x: you don't have to chainâ€¦ but at least the method is telling you that you should expect to be on the same page ;)
[21:08:51] dude-x: in my experience implicit waits are only good for one off scripts
[21:09:03] stephend|mtg: sfbrian: things like paypal integration
[21:09:06] dude-x: lukeis: ohâ€¦. interesting...
[21:09:38] sfbrian: don't get me started about paypal integration
[21:09:44] dude-x: lukeis: one thing i wuold like is keeping track of prior page visited
[21:09:48] sfbrian: or google checkout

[21:10:47] lukeis: hmm, not sure i see the point in tracking thatâ€¦ your test case should always know where it is
[21:12:39] sfbrian: stephend|mtg: what are you guys doing with paypal?
[21:12:52] stephend|mtg: sfbrian: contributions on addons.mozilla.org
[21:13:00] sfbrian: ah
[21:13:13] sfbrian: their sandbox is atrocious
[21:13:31] dude-x: lukeis: say you have a component that can be accessed via two different "web pages".  if you come from page A, you will want to synchronize one way, if you come from page B, you will synchronize the other way
[21:14:14] lukeis: then your constructor of page x that you get to from page a/b should take a parameter telling it referrer
[21:15:04] stephend|mtg: sfbrian: yes, it's god-awful
[21:15:13] stephend|mtg: down for a couple of days, and even when it's up...
[21:15:51] sfbrian: stephend|mtg: each paypal test has to login as a different user otherwise they don't work well in parallel
[21:16:26] stephend|mtg: https://github.com/mozilla/Addon-Tests/blob/master/tests/desktop/test_paypal.py
[21:16:30] sfbrian: we stubbed out paypal, screw the sandbox
[21:17:08] stephend|mtg: oh, and BTW
[21:17:17] stephend|mtg: https://github.com/mozilla/Addon-Tests/blob/master/pages/desktop/details.py#L103 helped our reliability for that test suite quite a bit
[21:17:21] dude-x: i see lukeisâ€¦ I'll have to think about that model for me to grok and see the benefitsâ€¦. maybe some example code will be nice.
[21:17:51] *lukeis doesn't have any to easily link to
[21:18:58] sfbrian: stephend|mtg: that is an elegant way of doing it
[21:19:08] stephend|mtg: surprisingly simple, too
[21:19:09] sfbrian: that's basically a wait until element is present?
[21:19:14] stephend|mtg: yeah
[21:19:31] stephend|mtg: we tried not to do it, but in the end it won our hearts
[21:19:38] lukeis: stephend|mtg: there's ExpectedConditions now ;)
[21:19:38] stephend|mtg: and now we do it out of practice
[21:20:01] stephend|mtg: lukeis: cool
[21:20:24] lukeis: not sure if you guys will use them :)
[21:20:29] dude-x: you make most of the page object methods propertiesâ€¦ makes the code look more like ruby
[21:20:33] dude-x: maybe i'll start doing that
[21:20:41] stephend|mtg: dude-x: lots of back and forth on that initially, iirc
[21:20:54] dude-x: about use @property
[21:20:57] stephend|mtg: and on a concept in our Firefox Support website tests called page provider
[21:21:23] dude-x: what are the pro's and cons of making most methods an @property
[21:21:44] lukeis: you don't have to type () ;)
[21:21:50] stephend|mtg: oh, and also: https://github.com/mozilla/sumo-tests/pull/159
[21:22:04] stephend|mtg: instead of looking for a logged-in state

[21:30:27] stephend: sfbrian: false-positive?  not sure

[21:30:36] stephend: yeah
[21:31:10] sfbrian: got around that by reseting the implicit wait to 0, check, sleep 1 second, repeat until it's not there, then reset the implicit wait back to what it was
