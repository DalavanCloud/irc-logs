Have used selenium IDE and created test case for part 1 - how to handle part 2 ? is there a easy way to identify elements of part 2 which gets displayed in IE to write cases ?

[06:04:05] vectorshelve: is there any way to capture layout issues since selenium cannot be used for that purpose ?
[06:04:29] andreastt: adamgoucher: Yes, you do it exactly like the Firefox profile actually.
[06:05:00] andreastt: adamgoucher: Take a look at OperaProfile for the implementation details, but basically it base64 encodes the entire profile directory.

[19:01:38] dominik__: hello everybody, I have a question with regards to timeouts
[19:02:45] dominik__: in specific it is related to the new session command and if this is taking more than a minute.
[19:03:53] dominik__: I changed the newSessionWaitTimeout 80000 in the selenium grid hub
[19:04:11] dominik__: but still it seems not to work
[19:04:28] dominik__: is there maybe any other timeout switch to consider?
