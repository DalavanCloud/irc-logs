[16:05:07] lukeis: so, you see that last email to patrick that i was referring to?
[16:05:31] KaibutsuX: jimevans: I didn't know the bindings mattered, doesn't chromedriver and iedriver work no matter what bindings you use?

[16:06:00] lukeis: simonstewart: Oct. 30
[16:06:35] jimevans: KaibutsuX: each has a server component, and the language that server component is written in matters. for chrome and IE, the server component is written in C++, so it's an executable. for opera, the server component is written entirely in java.
[16:06:37] simonstewart: Can you bounce it to me?

[16:08:00] andreastt: jimevans: Mostly true though.
[16:08:01] simonstewart: KaibutsuX: it's pretty easy to build a really slim java server that only contains the bits needed for the operadriver
[16:08:11] lukeis: dawagner: when you have time (heh) can we have a job in jenkins to deploy the sehq site?
[16:08:14] jimevans: KaibutsuX: it would be theoretically possible for each language binding to write it's own scope protocol layer (opera uses the scope protocol). i've started several times on a .NET one, but it's a **big** undertaking, and just don't have th time.

[16:13:43] jimevans: okay, i'm putting in an open plea for some help here. in bot.Keyboard.pressKey(), there's some code that is predicated on the bot.event.fire() for the keypress event returning true. this is the case on firefox > 10. for firefox <= 10, we're returning false, which causes the selections not to update properly. 
[16:14:25] davehunt: WSelenium: thanks for reporting it :) hopefully it will be updated soon
[16:15:04] jimevans: that is to say, dispatchEvent() is returning false for the key press event.

[16:27:14] AutomatedTester: nhirata: I use limechat but I have ZNC running there and then limechat connects to that
[16:27:22] KaibutsuX: can anyone refer me to anything on the use of native events in firefox? Is there any reason I should be using one or the other specifically if I'm testing on Windows with multiple browser instances simultaneously?
[16:27:33] AutomatedTester: nhirata: let me find the docs on how to do that for you

[16:28:54] nhirata: thanks!
[16:29:29] llaskin: so am I wrong to think that a job that is asking me to do C# is going backwards?
[16:29:32] dude-x: KaibutsuX: i don't know how native events works when multiple browsers are running… but the only time it's useful to have running is when the Actions API doens't work too well without it
[16:29:33] llaskin: isn't C# basically dead at this point?
[16:29:57] lukeis: ha
[16:30:05] lukeis: llaskin: no… it's not
[16:30:10] dude-x: C#? i don't think so, it's considered better than Java because it gains new language features that make it better to work with
[16:30:16] llaskin: ok.
[16:30:19] KaibutsuX: dude-x: so if I'm not using actions, it would be less to go wrong with them disabled?
[16:31:07] dude-x: KaibutsuX: well, native events does give you a bit more security, in that sometimes a widget may not respond to clicks properly in real use, and it will work only work syntheticallyl
[16:31:42] KaibutsuX: ahh
[16:31:51] jimevans: llaskin: i'd stay away from windows forms, that's a dying technology, but windows presentation foundation (wpf) is alive and well, and you can create windows store apps with it.
[16:32:27] jimevans: plus, there's a server-side market for c# code that's not going anywhere.
[16:33:05] llaskin: ok cool
[16:33:11] llaskin: so you wouldn't hesitate to take a C# job?
[16:33:28] jimevans: llaskin: depends on the job. :)

[19:54:32] AutomatedTester: lukeis: on Firefox OS the dialer/recent calls/contacts uses CSS Transforms to switch between the different menus
[19:54:56] AutomatedTester: jimevans: its a bit of a non issue, all implementors have the shim already
[19:55:29] jimevans: i suppose...

[19:56:37] AutomatedTester: I mean, chromedriver, IEDriver, Marionette, OperaDriver all have a shim of sorts
[19:57:46] AutomatedTester: jimevans: but it doesnt mean that client libraries need to use JSONWire Protocol
[19:58:20] jimevans: indeed.
[19:58:38] AutomatedTester: so remote will speak that but tight binding to Firefox will use JSON-over-TCP

[20:16:26] HolyGoat: Is it okay to share programs here that make use of Selenium? Thought maybe some people might be interested in what I've built

[20:17:39] dude-x: HolyGoat: i wouldn't mind see what you have created
[20:18:33] HolyGoat: lukeis: I understand, thanks. I'll post it there as well. Basically what I've done is I've created a Python module that lets you create Nagios NRPE plugins using Selenium real quick. It's at https://github.com/objectified/seymour
[20:19:22] lukeis: cool, thx for sharing
[20:19:31] HolyGoat: anytime
[20:19:42] dude-x: HolyGoat: You might as well say 2.7 for Python since there won't be a 2.8
[20:20:04] HolyGoat: dude-x: Didn't try it on 3 though :)
[20:20:54] HolyGoat: but good point :) I'll change the text, was fixing a typo anyway
[20:21:32] dude-x: HolyGoat: interesting you use selenium RC instead of webdriver. the RC API is only maintenance mode
[20:21:50] dude-x: but i suppose for monitoring you don't need fancy stuff
[20:22:08] ignacio__ has joined #selenium
[20:22:51] HolyGoat: dude-x: Yes I'm aware of it. I built it back when the webdriver implementation wasn't stable yet, and besides that, using the RC API was easier in order to implement what I wanted
[20:23:13] dude-x: makes sense
[20:23:24] HolyGoat: (it took ages for getting permission to open source this, hence the delay)
[20:24:19] HolyGoat: I've been thinking about making a webdriver based implementation, but it will be much harder to accomplish what I'm doing now with webdriver. Basically I'm intercepting calls to the python RC driver, and wrap them with e.g. benchmarking code
[20:24:42] HolyGoat: The new API is a bit more complex in that sense.
[20:25:12] lukeis: shouldn't be much more difficult with the python bindings to do, well I'd have to see how you did it before

Fixes issue #2353. | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=18080 | http://seleniumhq.org/ci.jsp?r=18080
[20:28:05] HolyGoat: lukeis: The code is in https://github.com/objectified/seymour/blob/master/seymour/seleniumproxy.py
[20:31:02] HolyGoat: I suppose the hard thing with the new api is that it consists of many more classes, whereas the old api was just one class that I needed to proxy
[20:31:13] HolyGoat: It's possible though, no doubt.
[20:31:54] lukeis: HolyGoat: ok… so the way to do it with webdriver / python would be to create a new class that extends RemoteConnection and wraps the execute function, then pass that into the RemoteWebDriver when an instance is created :)
[20:32:27] lukeis: (links shortly)
[20:32:49] HolyGoat: lukeis: Ah, that easy? I'll definitely look into it, thanks for the tip!

[20:33:38] lukeis: your RemoteConnection is what you pass in as the command_executor 
[20:34:13] HolyGoat: lukeis: ah just the entry point I needed, thanks a bunch!
[20:34:17] lukeis: i wouldn't say "that easy" but at least not more than a day or two of hacking
[20:34:37] HolyGoat: right, I could definitely branch off my current project to build this in parallel

[21:47:04] jimevans: after building the latest ghostdriver-dev phantomjs, and using the latest ghostdriver sources, i get a 98.98% pass rate on the .net webdriver common tests. 
[21:48:17] detronizator: super!
[21:48:22] detronizator: what's left there not passing?
[21:48:27] jimevans: we are ignoring alerts tests, several tests that aren't implemented on any driver or aren't appropriate for ghostdriver, and one frames test that crashes phantomjs, but outside that, we're passing 580 of 586 tests.
[21:48:42] jimevans: right-click doesn't work, but it doesn't work in phantomjs near as i can tell.
[21:49:16] detronizator: sounds like I should keep my focus on integrating into PhantomJS and worry about those things later
[21:49:17] jimevans: there are a couple of tests that fail for typing in contentEditable frames.
[21:49:23] detronizator: mmm
[21:49:32] detronizator: that is not cool
[21:50:15] jimevans: and lastly, there are a couple of javascript-based tests that fail, but the pages the test run against use relative urls, and i'm pretty sure phantomjs has an issue with that.
[21:51:11] jimevans: and there is that one frame test where if you click on an element that deletes the frame it's in, you crash.
[21:52:31] jimevans: there are tests for all of these scenarios in the java webdriver tests.
