[13:11:37] mand: Hi
[13:14:03] mand: I'm using IE driver (in VirtualBox with a remove server) and it's really slow to recognice that an action has finished, ie. it loads a page quite fast and then hangs around 30 seconds before doing the next action
[13:14:55] mand: Any idea how to improve that?
[13:27:26] mand: It also seems it cannot handle the Xpath queries that work fine in Firefox

[21:26:49] freynaud: Gulshan: you don't have that node registered
[21:26:54] freynaud: that's what the message says
[21:27:14] freynaud: 127.0.0.1 != localhost, it's a string match
[21:30:45] freynaud: --  /grid/api/hub/ -- should give you a list of currently known node ids
