[16:15:57] nimeacuerdo: do you guys know if after using the "move to" command on the json wire protocol
[16:16:08] nimeacuerdo: I mean "moveto"
[16:16:41] nimeacuerdo: the cursor is expected to remain at the target location until any other subsequent command is invoked?
[16:17:14] AutomatedTester: nimeacuerdo: PHP bindings by any change?
[16:17:18] AutomatedTester: chance even
[16:17:31] nimeacuerdo: php facebook driver
[16:18:19] AutomatedTester: there used to be a persistence bug, but not sure if it is/isnt fixed
[16:18:26] *lukeis needs to emphasize adam's on the donwload page…
[16:19:01] nimeacuerdo: I wonder if after doing that "moveto" call a subsequent call to /element or /click is performed by resetting the cursor position at 0,0 or whatever
[16:19:02] AutomatedTester: <mini rant> as a user you shouldnt be memorising JSON Wire Protocol. Bloody facebook cant do anything bloody right!!!!</mini rant>
[16:19:32] nimeacuerdo: AutomatedTester: well, the Facebook driver is pretty thin
[16:19:34] dawagner has joined #selenium
[16:19:42] Ardesco: lukeis: hows your cookie experience in safari based things
[16:19:47] nimeacuerdo: and ultimately relies mostly on the jsonwire protocol
[16:20:11] AutomatedTester: nimeacuerdo: and the hope we never change the protocol
[16:20:33] AutomatedTester: since its not the API, its a transport mechanism
[16:20:35] lukeis: Ardesco: um, no different than others so far… but I haven't used SafariDriver at all really (ios cookies work as expected)
[16:20:42] Ardesco: :/
[16:20:56] Ardesco: document.cookie doesn't seem to return cookies for the current path, only cookies for /
[16:21:01] Ardesco: trying o find a workaround
[16:22:15] nimeacuerdo: AutomatedTester: any existing driver will have to be updated if that happens, that's true
[16:22:19] *jimevans thinks the Facebook bindings are… severely lacking.
[16:22:45] jimevans: :seen adamgoucher
[16:22:45] selbot2_: adamgoucher was last seen 4 days ago, quitting.
[16:22:50] nimeacuerdo: jimevans: best php driver I found at the time of choosing one
[16:22:57] lukeis: jimevans: thus why adam's need to be recommended ;)
[16:23:11] jimevans: nimeacuerdo: time to refactor.
[16:23:23] jimevans: with a different php binding.
[16:23:44] AutomatedTester: nimeacuerdo: a click() will click in the center of the element
[16:24:25] AutomatedTester: well center-ish
[16:24:36] AutomatedTester: there are times where we dont click in the center of the element
[16:25:50] nimeacuerdo: AutomatedTester: ok, but in my scenario we have an element such that when the mouse is over it, a button appears 
[16:26:09] nimeacuerdo: AutomatedTester: and when the mouse moves out, the button goes away
[16:26:13] nimeacuerdo: in the tests
[16:26:18] nimeacuerdo: the hover is always fine
[16:26:43] nimeacuerdo: but sometimes the button is not found by an /element call afterwards
[16:27:04] nimeacuerdo: that is why I was wondering about the internals of hover and the subsequent /element call
[16:27:11] nimeacuerdo: if for whatever the reason
[16:27:20] nimeacuerdo: the mouse pointer position is reset
[16:27:43] nimeacuerdo: the button vanishes
[16:27:50] nimeacuerdo: with a fade out
[16:28:03] nimeacuerdo: that makes the pass sometimes
[16:28:29] nimeacuerdo: maybe because webdriver is fast enough in those cases to find and click the button before it's gone?
[16:29:34] nimeacuerdo: I have only found these issues with parts of the UI where mouseover events are used to hide/show parts of the UI
[16:29:50] jibay has joined #selenium
[16:29:50] nimeacuerdo: anywhere else, no probs
[16:30:26] nimeacuerdo: jimevans: any recommendation over that? or just the Facebook one is now known to be as bad as to be discouraged?
[16:31:00] jimevans: nimeacuerdo: adamgoucher's php bindings are actively maintained.
[16:31:41] nimeacuerdo: jimevans: thx, will have a look
[16:31:44] jimevans: fwiw, any binding that exposes the user to the wire protocol to the degree the Facebook bindings do is to be avoided.
[16:31:50] jimevans: (in my opinion)
[16:33:20] nimeacuerdo: jimevans: we have added some sugar over it, although I agree with this approach being a problem should the protocol change
[16:33:52] nimeacuerdo: nevertheless, any hints/ideas about the hovering issue?
[16:34:36] nimeacuerdo: I haven't found info about the internals of the driver that I could link to such behavior
[16:34:46] nimeacuerdo: (chrome in this case)
[16:34:55] jimevans: no idea about how chrome handles that.
[16:35:07] jimevans: can talk at length about IE, but not chrome.
[16:35:55] jimevans: watfo this crashes the first time i try it?\

[19:18:48] Osleg: hello everybody
[19:18:58] dude-x: hello
[19:19:09] Osleg: I'm trying to run selenium-standalione server as service in windows
[19:19:38] Osleg: i was able to do it with help of nssm and java service wrapper in windows XP without any issue
[19:19:54] Osleg: but when it comes to win7 - it randomly fails
[19:20:03] Osleg: in windows 8 it doesnt work at all
[19:20:18] Osleg: if i run it from CMD it works fine in both 7 and 8
[19:20:44] Osleg: the exception im recieving is : 
[19:21:08] Osleg: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
[19:21:21] Osleg: any advice would be highly appriciated -_-
[19:21:49] dude-x: using the same versions of java?
[19:21:55] Osleg: yes
[19:22:03] Osleg: all 3 machines same java
[19:22:05] dude-x: i don't know then. windows is not my domain
[19:22:08] jimevans: Osleg: don't do it. attempting to run as a windows service will result in unpredictable results for certain browsers, IE in particular.
[19:22:15] Osleg: same settings for nssm and same settings for java wrapper
[19:22:20] jleyba_ has joined #selenium
[19:22:44] Osleg: jimevans: but there is no other way to hide IE window in windows
[19:23:05] jimevans: and you should never attempt to hide the IE window.
[19:23:16] jimevans: the IE driver is almost guaranteed to fail if you try that.
[19:23:46] Osleg: on XP it works great, so my thought (maybe incorrect) that there is something with the win version that changed
[19:24:55] jimevans: again, it's almost guaranteed to fail. the introduction of mandatory integrity levels for processes screwed everything with respect to IE.
[19:25:09] jimevans: and that was a Vista change.
[19:25:39] Osleg: uhm so from vista and on there is a little chance to make it work and huge chance that it will fail
[19:25:44] Osleg: i get it correctly?
[19:25:51] jimevans: exactly.
[19:26:16] Osleg: well, thanks
[19:26:20] jimevans: i would go back to first principles and figure out exactly why you think you need to run as a service.
[19:26:40] jimevans: if it's only to hide the browser window, then "you're doing it wrong" with selenium.
[19:27:35] Osleg: jimevans: because i use it to parse a website written on javascript, and lately this "parser" should be installed on "clients" who have to work with scrapped data
[19:28:06] Osleg: and poping IE windows will not be very pleasant for people 
[19:30:30] Osleg: and i didn't find other way except of selenium to gather data from JS site
[19:30:40] barancev: Osleg: can it be done with HtmlUnitDriver or GhostDriver instead of IE?
[19:30:54] Osleg: i tried with htmlInot
[19:30:57] Osleg: unit*
[19:31:09] Osleg: but it doesn't compile all needed JS well
[19:31:32] Osleg: and i didnt hear about ghostdriver yet, ill check about it
[19:31:42] jimevans: is your client actually written in java?
[19:31:54] jimevans: or some other language?
[19:32:20] Osleg: python
[19:34:01] jimevans: did ghost not work for you? http://jeanphix.me/Ghost.py/
[19:35:32] Osleg: both ghostdriver and ghost looks promising
[19:35:44] Osleg: i will give a try 
[19:36:19] Osleg: btw
[19:36:22] Osleg: if that matters

[19:55:23] rpereira has joined #selenium
[19:55:29] jleyba: it's redundant and makes it hard to reuse some of the factories methods in ExpectedConditions
[19:55:48] dude-x: what would be the replacement?
[19:55:57] dude-x: that would break code in my prior work's test framework
[19:56:07] jleyba: just use its parent: com.google.common.base.Function
[19:56:26] lukeis: i also have extensively used it
[19:56:58] jleyba: Yeah, it's going to suck no matter how it's handled
[19:57:08] dude-x: i also like the fact that it's called ExpectedCondition since it self documents the purpose of that block of code
[19:57:24] lukeis: i think you'll find it's all over the places… before ExpectedConditions really came in the know, everyone just wrote their own inline extension of it
[19:57:38] jleyba: I want all the locator methods in ExpectedConditions to work off of SearchContext
[19:57:43] jleyba: not WebDriver
[19:58:07] jleyba: ExpectedCondition<T> extends Function<WebDriver, T> screws that over
[19:58:19] jleyba: Can't figure out how to change this without causing a lot of pain
[19:58:38] lukeis: create a new class? :)

[20:01:08] lukeis: no, RC is to jam everything in one class… WD, just add yet another class ;)

[20:04:48] AutomatedTester: RC === God Object
[20:04:57] AutomatedTester: WebDriver is OO
[20:05:13] jleyba: So what if we had ExpectedCondition<T> => Condition<K, V> => Function<K, V>
[20:05:35] jleyba: And update ExpectedConditions to return Condition objects where appropriate?

[20:07:39] AutomatedTester: oh the irony
[20:07:49] RossPatterson: Amen, brothers.
[20:08:01] *RossPatterson loves code that fails to compile instead of failing to run.
[20:08:28] jleyba: There's a reason I use Closure and it's compiler
[20:08:28] dude-x: i think no matter the choice of language style, they both need tests
[20:08:41] AutomatedTester: static type vs dynamic type is not really a battle
[20:08:50] AutomatedTester: its where you put your crutch
[20:09:24] jleyba: dude-x: yeah, any language without solid test support is a non-starter
[20:09:29] *jleyba looks at Dart
[20:09:30] dude-x: in java you still have to worry about object nullness or watch stuff spontaneously explode
[20:10:21] lukeis: funny thing with WD is no matter which language you can still get a runtime exception on (almost) *any* WD command ;)
[20:10:24] jleyba: dude-x: code conventions & javax.annotations.Nullable make NPEs a lot less common
[20:10:29] RossPatterson: dude-x: Yes, but static analyzers today can do a remarkably good job finding probable NPEs.

[21:01:12] AutomatedTester: if you did it from the start then yes it will work

[21:01:23] AutomatedTester: barancev: jleyba: looks like I had a bad update
[21:01:36] AutomatedTester: tried svn up again and got the rest of the code and works fine
[21:01:55] GorbiE: the code i got written in mechanize, it retrives the Login Page but doens't submit the forms which is the most important part.
[21:01:56] GorbiE: :S
[21:02:24] GorbiE: and delete the code is lost time so would like to find another way to do it.
[21:05:04] lukeis: the time to write the selenium code (in ruby) to retrieve a page should be trivial and not (much) wasted/lost time
[21:06:56] barancev: any ideas why RenderedWebElementTest.testShouldPickUpStyleOfAnElement is flaky? ^^^^

[21:14:52] cowmix has joined #selenium
[21:15:14] barancev: aha, it's not this test but a previous one
[21:16:01] cowmix: is there a specific IRC channel for Jenkins / Selenium grid help?
[21:17:02] AutomatedTester: selenium grid here
[21:17:10] AutomatedTester: jenkins, if we know we will answer
[21:18:02] friskd has joined #selenium
[21:22:01] cowmix: AutomatedTester: Everything looks good for registering all nodes (I only have one) I get with the python webdriver: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4008482/capture/no-sessions.png
[21:22:52] AutomatedTester: weird
[21:23:12] AutomatedTester: the grid definitely has a node attached to the hub?
[21:24:10] cowmix: I think so: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4008482/capture/nodez.png
[21:24:53] cowmix: the node is a windows 2008 server.. with UAE turned off..
[21:24:59] barancev: browserTimeout = 0? is it "zero" or "forever"?
[21:25:18] Ardesco: are you trying to run a test against IE?
[21:25:27] Ardesco: occams razor and all that :)
[21:25:38] cowmix: Ardesco: Yet
[21:25:46] cowmix: I mean"Yes"
[21:26:22] Ardesco: that's that ut of the window then
[21:28:56] *Ardesco punches Safari in the face again
[21:29:02] barancev: how to disable the whole test class to run on sauce?
[21:29:26] cowmix: FWIW, here's what I doing in Python: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4008482/capture/python-code.png
[21:30:07] lukeis: browsername is incorrect
[21:30:53] cowmix: lukeis: Hmm..  what should it be?
[21:31:00] barancev: "internet explorer"
[21:31:11] lukeis: "browserName": "internet explorer"
[21:31:13] Ardesco: for no obvious reason safari driver is now just sitting there and doing nothing
[21:31:21] *Ardesco starts hitting the kill switch
[21:31:50] barancev: does not python binding provide a set of constants for browser names?
[21:32:00] lukeis: cowmix: use webdriver.DesiredCapabilites.INTERNETEXPLORER
[21:32:02] lukeis: it does
[21:32:11] barancev: good!
[21:32:13] *AutomatedTester fucking hates visibility bugs
[21:32:24] AutomatedTester: the edge cases are plentiful
[21:32:39] barancev: AutomatedTester: IE9 is yours! :)
[21:33:00] AutomatedTester: barancev: I am doing more transform work so will fix shortly
[21:33:56] jimevans: i have an IE driver change that I'm pretty sure will break something somewhere. i just *know* i haven't got all the memory management right.
[21:35:17] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I would swap you but....
[21:36:53] Ardesco: out of interest how do you specify the driver when running the generic tests through intellij
[21:37:13] Ardesco: in client -> test
[21:42:38] cowmix: I think I'm in a little over my head.. Here's my lastest shot with "webdriver.DesiredCapabilites.INTERNETEXPLORER": https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4008482/capture/new-ie-try.png
[21:43:24] lukeis: how did you register the node to the grid?
[21:43:58] cowmix: when the Windows node registers with Jenkins.. the Selenium grid stuff happens at the same time.
[21:44:23] cowmix: you can see it in the logs
[21:44:27] lukeis: ah, you're using the jenkins plugin?
[21:44:37] farlan has left #selenium
[21:44:51] cowmix: lukeis: yup.. i take it that's bad news?
[21:45:20] lukeis: no… i think it's just got one guy maintaining it and it may be a few releases back
[21:45:23] nhirata has joined #selenium
[21:45:28] lukeis: i thought it was working from what i heard
[21:45:37] lukeis: how are you telling it to run 5 IE instances only though?
[21:45:44] *lukeis hasn't actually used the plugin
[21:47:11] AutomatedTester: I fucking hate css
[21:47:38] cowmix: it is a parameter in the plugin.. you can see in this screenshot Selenium grid now shows it configured: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4008482/capture/nodez.png
[21:47:39] Ardesco: heh
[21:47:40] *lukeis <3 CSS 3.0 as defined by the W3C spec
[21:48:17] dale has joined #selenium
[21:48:28] AutomatedTester: lukeis: if I do .someRandomClass { transform: translateY(-75%); } 
[21:48:43] lukeis: cowmix: can you try changing your remote host url directly point to the node?
[21:48:48] AutomatedTester: lukeis: do you think it would be visible to someone looking at the page?
[21:49:13] lukeis: AutomatedTester: honestly depends on where it was ;)
[21:49:37] AutomatedTester: if it were nearish the top of the DOM?
[21:50:27] gabrielrotbart has joined #selenium
[21:50:31] lukeis: top of the DOM doesn't matter ;) top of the viewport with position, then maybe yes
[21:51:36] AutomatedTester: andreastt: Opera have done a great job on CSS Transform Matrices
[21:51:42] AutomatedTester: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/understanding-the-css-transforms-matrix/
[21:51:53] AutomatedTester: I have a test
[21:52:25] AutomatedTester: and its failing because the item is visible
[21:52:29] lukeis: opera always has had the best css support… sadly i haven't had the user #s 
[21:53:42] nhirata has joined #selenium
[21:53:43] lukeis: AutomatedTester: are you expecting it to not be visible?
[21:54:32] AutomatedTester: lukeis: I was
[21:54:34] lukeis: transform -75% would never go below 0px position if I had to guess
[21:54:56] AutomatedTester: well in my test it gets a negative px
[21:55:00] AutomatedTester: but its still visible
[21:55:37] AutomatedTester: my current code says its not visible but it is visible
[21:55:50] lukeis: yay
[21:56:07] cowmix: whoa, I think we are getting somewhere.. here's direct to the node: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4008482/capture/zone-hell.png

[22:02:03] AutomatedTester: angry birds has in game paying for stuff
[22:02:10] AutomatedTester: wtf
[22:02:48] lukeis: they want moar monies
[22:03:10] AutomatedTester: they got my £0.69 
[22:03:25] AutomatedTester: so that I could play it on my £600 phone
[22:03:31] lukeis: they have a lot of 'free' ways to play the game (chrome for example)
[22:04:07] *AutomatedTester doesnt mind paying
[22:04:12] AutomatedTester: for the game that is
[22:04:26] AutomatedTester: but in game paying to actually play the game makes me sad

[22:08:04] jimevans: i'll say it again, multithreading is hard. let's go shopping.
[22:08:06] AutomatedTester: so my transforms patch kinda works
[22:08:16] jimevans: brb.
[22:08:32] AutomatedTester: but if people do magic transforms then its broken

[22:21:38] Ardesco: hmm
[22:21:44] Ardesco: i have a patch for safari cookies
[22:21:58] Ardesco: but it looks like the cookie tests don't run against localhost
[22:21:59] lukeis: does it involve punching safari in the face?
[22:22:19] Ardesco: maybe a bit :)
[22:22:45] Ardesco: safari seems to not delete cookies unless you specify a path and a domain
[22:23:01] Ardesco: at least safari 6 seems to act that way
[22:23:32] lukeis: even if the cookie didn't specify them originally?
[22:23:37] Ardesco: the cookie implementation test seems to be set up to not run against localhost though
[22:24:10] AutomatedTester: barancev: what version of IE?
[22:24:18] Ardesco: so i don't have a test for it atm
[22:24:26] lukeis: localhost is not really a valid cookie testing scenario… browser *really* like to f* up cookie handling on localhost
[22:24:46] barancev: AutomatedTester: IE9
[22:25:03] Ardesco: have to revert my patch to check that lukeis 
[22:25:41] Ardesco: so i guess the question is shall i just submit the patch as is ?
[22:25:42] AutomatedTester: barancev: and what are you clicking to get the onBlur to fire?
[22:26:09] lukeis: Ardesco: does it fix something that can be reproduced with a valid domain?
[22:26:17] Ardesco: safari also seems to ignore cookies in the current path on a document.cookie but thats another problem
[22:26:19] lukeis: (or even IP address)
[22:26:36] barancev: AutomatedTester: np, I've already found that IE raises an event
[22:26:52] Ardesco: site i'm testing at work doesn't have the google analytics cookies removed without my patch, it does with my patch
[22:26:57] barancev: but it cannot execute document.getElementById('blur').textContent='blur'
[22:26:58] Ardesco: all the tests are passing locally
[22:27:15] Ardesco: but I don't have any additional tests to prove the changes atm
[22:27:16] jleyba: Ardesco: what's your patch?
[22:27:34] Ardesco: i'm also seeing some weirdness with safari not always setting a clean session
[22:27:45] Ardesco: let me gist it
[22:27:55] jleyba: Ardesco: are you using the clean session property?
[22:28:21] Ardesco: setting it as a desired capability when instantiating a new driver objec
[22:29:25] Ardesco: doh not a git repo
[22:30:37] Ardesco: https://gist.github.com/4062573
[22:31:50] Ardesco: as for using clean session properly
[22:32:02] jleyba: Hmm.  Won't that cause problems with cookies whose path is not /?
[22:32:08] barancev: IE can't change textContent, it wants me to change innerHTML
[22:32:29] Ardesco: i just had the CleanSessionTest in selenium fail because Safari had google analytics cookies cached that it wasn't removing
[22:32:56] Ardesco: document.cookie only seems to return cookies with a path of / in the safari console
[22:33:20] Ardesco: I did have a patch earlier that took the current path and tried to clear them against / and the current path
[22:33:25] Ardesco: but seemed pointless
[22:33:38] Ardesco: this is all very safari 6 biased though
[22:34:06] jimevans: barancev: it should allow you to set textContent, as long as the document mode is "IE9 standards"
[22:34:26] Ardesco: not to mention i'm sure i saw a comment somewhere that said delete all cookies only cleared out cookies on /
[22:34:32] barancev: jimevans: no idea what document mode selenium sets
[22:34:43] jimevans: selenium doesn't; the browser does.
[22:34:45] jimevans: it guesses. 
[22:34:54] jimevans: based on the <!DOCTYPE> of the document

[22:44:45] jimevans: barancev: don't rightly know, but i've never claimed that the IE driver would work as part of a windows service, and there are enough differences in that environment that i wouldn't know where to begin troubleshooting.
