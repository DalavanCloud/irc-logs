[12:03:58] kallisti: a library that uses webdriver
[12:06:28] kallisti: oh, well, it's not exactly a library. just an example
[12:08:41] kallisti: I'm not entirely sure what chuchu does though
[12:10:30] kallisti: it looks like an annotation language used to test software requirements/behaviors
[12:10:53] kallisti: and then webdriver is used to write the actual test code.

[14:07:25] dhpe: Hi. What would be the most general and reliable way to open up the browser in a predefined size? It should work in all supported browsers (well, the non-mobile ones at least).
