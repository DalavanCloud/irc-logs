[08:00:53] caddoo has joined #selenium
[08:03:02] dhpe: anybody got a sophisticated estimate: ratio of software businesses doing user interface test automation vs. businesses doing manual testing only?
[08:03:16] girija has left #selenium
[08:03:51] stephend: depends on the industry
[08:04:29] stephend: continuous-deployment companies tend to do very little UI test-automation, on the whole
[08:04:46] stephend: Etsy, New Relic, Flickr, some parts of Mozilla
[08:05:07] stephend: manual only tends to, of course, typically be smaller shops
[08:05:32] stephend: sorry, doesn't help with a figure approximation, I know
[08:05:52] jeichar has joined #selenium
[08:06:12] dhpe: what i've observed many companies recognize that manual testing is expensive, but are still not automating.
[08:06:49] stephend: reliability and test maintenance can be an issue
[08:06:56] stephend: as well as finding someone with a good skillset
[08:07:29] dhpe: so is automation just too difficult for most?
[08:07:43] stephend: dhpe: surprisingly few shops realize the benefits of POM
[08:08:12] stephend: great automators tend to be senior QA engineers, and are likely more $$$, too
[08:09:27] stephend: I'm generalizing a lot :-)
[08:09:37] stephend: I've seen a ton of resumes in the past 2 months
[08:09:52] stephend: a great number are really great manual-qa engineers, with very little automation skills
[08:10:08] stephend: and vice-versa
[08:10:43] stephend: people who are great at both exist, to be sure, they're either just ambivalent about what they get to focus on, or like both equally)
[08:11:52] dhpe: Why is it so hard to sell the automation "promise"? We've got great tools available like sauce that provides the infra. Still, manual testing is going strong.
[08:12:22] stephend: it takes work to get the infrastructure set up
[08:12:26] stephend: a lot
[08:12:32] stephend: unless you really just do something like sauce
[08:12:38] stephend: I know from experience
[08:12:59] dhpe: yeah but why isn't everybody using sauce then
[08:13:04] stephend: cost?
[08:13:23] stephend: or, like us, the need to use the latest of both selenium + firefox?
[08:13:24] stephend: I dunno
[08:13:27] stephend: multiple factors
[08:13:32] stephend: wanting to keep things in-house
[08:13:41] stephend: (BTW, we augment in-house Grid w/sauce)
[08:14:25] stephend: some bigger companies, especially, either have "not invented here" mentalities, or policies that say "our IT department needs to support it.", etc.
[08:14:48] aivaturi has joined #selenium
[08:15:47] stephend: dhpe: sauce won't generally tell you how to structure your tests, either
[08:16:10] stephend: not that they don't have blog posts on that stuff, or some consulting
[08:16:24] dhpe: yeah so test automation is still hard even though u'd get the infra for "free"
[08:16:34] stephend: but for sustainable, flexible tests, people should really go page-object model
[08:16:37] stephend: yep
[08:16:46] stephend: and webdriver wait, too, as we found out
[08:16:51] stephend: especially from 2.21 or so, on
[08:17:19] dhpe: not that manual testing is not hard - actually impossible to do systematically and with all browsers, etc.
[08:17:38] stephend: not impossible
[08:17:42] stephend: but, yes, really hard
[08:17:43] stephend: huge lab
[08:18:05] stephend: configuration management nightmare
[08:18:30] dhpe: i mean do test some complicated flows, and do that exactly the same way over and over again, humans will do mistakes.
[08:18:42] stephend: indeeed
[08:19:03] stephend: one of the classic "what's a good place for manual vs automation" questions during a phone-screen/interview
[08:19:21] stephend: if a candidate doesn't mention "tester fatigue" or "reliability," it's typically a bad sign
[08:19:42] stephend: not that automation means it's a given, reliability-wise
[08:19:48] stephend: but once you get there, with effort...
[08:21:01] dhpe: i think a lot of people have been misled to believe automation is something you can trivially do by recording, and then gain the $$$. Real world: automation requires all the normal programming practices, refactoring, etc.
[08:21:49] stephend: yep
[08:21:54] stephend: higher-level skillset
[08:21:56] stephend: flow-control is huge
[08:22:02] stephend: and logic, lots of logic
[08:22:03] dhpe: and that contributes to the fact that prople are not doing it at all. because they tried "it" but actually they never tried it as it should have been tried.
[08:22:27] stephend: it kills me when directors just blindly go "why isn't it automated by now?"
[08:23:40] dhpe: what do you think is the value of test automation results then. what is the thing they actually tell when it fails or succeeds? I think this is something that is not being talked enough.
[08:24:00] dhpe: since a manual tester can be asked whether the system was usable and she could accomplish some tasks.
[08:24:06] stephend: depends on how involved or technical they are, with the tests
[08:24:21] stephend: and how the tests are named/written
[08:24:30] stephend: our are POM, and are verbosely named
[08:24:48] stephend: like, "click_on_register_and_ensure_resulting_window_is_register_screen"
[08:24:57] stephend: bad example, but yes, we really have tests that are nearly that long
[08:25:00] stephend: PEP8, what? :)
[08:25:12] stephend: so, it's clear what the end goal of that test is
[08:25:41] stephend: also, with POM
[08:26:10] stephend: since you break things up into files/subclasses, the directory names can help give a sense of coverage
[08:26:13] stephend: if you're consistent
[08:26:14] dhpe: so your company builds selenium infras for companies and does test case consulting?
[08:26:21] stephend: no
[08:26:23] stephend: Mozilla
[08:26:27] stephend: just our own websites
[08:26:52] dhpe: okay so mozilla has custom multibrowser infra that you maintain?
[08:27:06] stephend: yes
[08:27:16] dhpe: nice. any issues? :)
[08:27:20] stephend: lots
[08:27:25] stephend: especially with mac, on Grid
[08:27:44] stephend: dave hunt wrote a plugin, which allows us to call to sauce labs or our own internal infra/Grid: https://github.com/davehunt/pytest-mozwebqa
[08:28:22] stephend: keeping versions updated, now that most update every 6 weeks, is a "bit" of a pain
[08:28:35] stephend: we have 6 mac minis, and 4 virtual machines spread across those
[08:28:43] stephend: with opera, IE, firefox, chrome set up
[08:29:01] dhpe: what do you think is the delay when you start writing a new test case and get it running in all browsers? do you have a smooth process there?
[08:29:21] stephend: oh, that's really easy now, with the plugin, yeah
[08:29:29] stephend: and we use Jenkins, which is fantastic for our needs
[08:30:01] dhpe: so you write something, push to CI, wait for results?
[08:30:02] stephend: we can literally clone a job in Jenkins and tweak a baseURL
[08:30:19] stephend: pretty much
[08:30:38] stephend: everyone runs locally while they're developing, submitting, and reviewing a pull request in GitHub
[08:30:46] barancev: stephend: you may know it, but: http://sauceio.com/index.php/2012/09/introducing-the-sauce-plugin-for-selenium-grid/
[08:30:58] stephend: yes, thanks
[08:30:59] dhpe: so everybody has like a local selenium with multiple browsers?
[08:32:08] stephend: no
[08:32:19] stephend: locally, most suites only run on firefox
[08:32:30] teodosia_sel has joined #selenium
[08:32:33] stephend: some run an instance of Grid, with concurrency
[08:32:42] stephend: others just run within a WebDriver instance
[08:33:10] stephend: dhpe: we get a lot of crowd-sourced testing/bugs, due to the nature of our company/org/sites
[08:33:18] stephend: developers give us a lot of great feedback
[08:33:22] stephend: as do community members
[08:33:30] stephend: hi teodosia_sel
[08:33:50] stephend: Happy Friday :-)
[08:34:06] stephend: barancev: do you run a local Grid instance?
[08:34:22] barancev: a small one
[08:34:23] dhpe: what happens when a test case fails in the cloud and you don't have the browser locally?
[08:34:55] barancev: for browser/os difersity, not to parallelize tests
[08:34:56] stephend: dhpe: we look at the screenshot, the URL + the exception
[08:35:12] stephend: barancev: ever run on mac firefox?
[08:35:16] stephend: which language?
[08:35:22] barancev: no, sir :)
[08:35:30] barancev: macs are out of scope
[08:35:48] stephend: heh
[08:35:51] barancev: (and I'm happy about this)
[08:36:07] stephend: we only run on them because when we started, you couldn't run OS X on x86 hardware
[08:36:10] stephend: (commodity)
[08:36:26] stephend: so we decided to go the VMWare Fusion route, on mac as a host
[08:36:58] stephend: we really can only get native-events reliable on windows, so that made us put up more VMs
[08:39:14] barancev: do you know why browser.removeProgressListener can hang?
[08:39:45] barancev: profile.setPreference("webdriver.load.strategy", "unstable") is broken
[08:40:12] barancev: it can't unregister the listener
[08:42:29] stephend: me?  nah, sorry

[12:01:35] AutomatedTester: had about £6000 worth of tech on me
[12:02:01] jimevans: AutomatedTester: say, is there an issue in the tracker for the changes to the marionette protocol that you mentioned you'd be making? i want to be able to check on it without bugging you every time i want a status update.
[12:02:20] AutomatedTester: jimevans: sorry I havent added them yet
[12:02:34] AutomatedTester: jimevans: my plate overflow'eth atm
[12:02:44] jimevans: no worries. not concerned about it.
[12:03:11] AutomatedTester: jimevans: it needs to be fixed since part of the issues you noted are against the spec
[12:03:27] jimevans: this is true. :)
[12:03:49] AutomatedTester: but simonstewart added a get out of jail card yesterday
[12:04:06] AutomatedTester: to simplify something that was looking like a mess
[12:04:17] AutomatedTester: we did a fair bit yesterday
[12:04:53] jimevans: ah the old, "here's a non-normative recommendation of using JSON-over-HTTP, but you really don't have to use it"?
[12:05:07] AutomatedTester: yea
[12:06:05] AutomatedTester: we added a you dont have to do it but at least supply a shim
[12:06:19] AutomatedTester: which simplifies one thing
[12:06:27] jimevans: of which, the java remote server conveniently serves as one. :)
[12:06:37] AutomatedTester: but means people can go widely off track
[12:06:45] AutomatedTester: as long as the shim "works"
[12:07:28] jimevans: that nicely covers the opera implementation, as well as others.
[12:07:33] AutomatedTester: Mozilla, Opera and Google all have shims available
[12:07:47] AutomatedTester: it might just upset people
[12:08:08] AutomatedTester: "Why when my code is in Java do I need a python dependency to use Firefox"
[12:08:31] AutomatedTester: "why when my code is in .NET do I need a Java dependency to use Opera"
[12:08:39] AutomatedTester: those fun arguments
[12:08:47] jimevans: right. that's why i prefer the ability to get down to the native protocol and want to produce native versions of each of the drivers.
[12:08:53] dawagner: * AutomatedTester casually mentions he can time-travel
[12:09:16] AutomatedTester: dawagner: I time travel all the time
[12:09:20] jimevans: with firefox, that's easy.

[15:02:26] jimevans: detronizator: yt?
[15:02:35] detronizator: jimevans: y
[15:02:38] detronizator: what's up?
[15:02:51] jimevans: detronizator: awesome stuff with the async js execution. works a treat now.
[15:03:15] detronizator: yeah. I always thought that that part was a bit flaky
[15:03:22] jimevans: i'll have updated pass/fail stats in about 5 minutes.
[15:03:27] lucabox: dawagner: unfortunately at the moment I can only *use* the prebuilt android webdriver.
[15:03:43] barancev: AutomatedTester: yes, not much info https://developer.allizom.org/en-US/docs/XUL/Method/removeProgressListener
[15:03:50] detronizator: maybe u don't realize, but your investigations is improving PhantomJS more than GhostDriver itself.
[15:04:05] jimevans: detronizator: :D
[15:05:00] barancev: AutomatedTester: can you check the code snippet from #4604 on a linux system?
[15:05:01] selbot2_: 03 open/new When webdriver.load.strategy is set to 'unstable' on 64bit environment - firefox hangs. - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4604 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Browser-Firefox]
[15:06:12] jimevans: detronizator: one thing i'm finding that phantomjs isn't handling well is non-ascii characters. not sure why that is.
[15:06:13] lucabox: dawagner: sifting through http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/AndroidDriver#Install_the_Android_SDK but ./go android_server itself fails too (complaining of no sdk found, path is ok though) not to mention trying to create a eclipse project :/ I wonder if there are other pointers other than the help page I am using
[15:07:08] detronizator: jimevans: because I think who made the integration with mongoose, should change job and go for fox hunting. In Antartica.
[15:07:51] jimevans: heh. i've been fox hunting. :)
[15:08:05] detronizator: yeah, in Antartica?
[15:08:10] jimevans: the hounds and horses would get really really cold in antarctica.
[15:08:29] dawagner: lucabox: So, you need to download the SDK from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
[15:08:41] dawagner: Then, $TRUNK/properties.yaml specifies the path to it
[15:09:05] jimevans: 91.64% pass rate.
[15:09:14] dawagner: The default is $TRUNK/../android_sdk so you can either: Move the SDK there, symlink it to there, or change the path in that file to point at your actual path
[15:09:19] jimevans: less than 50 failures total.
[15:11:26] lucabox: dawagner: done that already (my sdk in in my ~ and it's ../android_sdk from the selenium folder), let me double check the yaml file though
[15:13:24] detronizator: jimevans: more bugs to fix? :(
[15:13:56] jimevans: a few, i think. some that are out of the ghostdriver scope.
[15:14:23] jimevans: the utf-8 encoding mongoose issue would solve more than a couple of those.
[15:16:36] jimevans: if you wanted to work on refactoring that switchTo().window() pull request, that'd be fine by me. prototypical inheritance makes my head spin. :)

[15:24:26] lucabox: dawagner: may I be damned. I had my sdk in android-sdk while it should be in android_sdk. :/ will try again now, if it works next step is to import the prj in eclipse

[15:27:46] dmachi has joined #selenium
[15:28:03] detronizator: jimevans: yes. it's a very "ignorant" and "quick&dirty" implementation
[15:28:12] detronizator: I'd gladly trash it
[15:28:36] jimevans: i wonder if changing QString::fromLocal8Bit with QString::fromUtf8 would do the trick?
[15:29:07] detronizator: be my guest! :)
[15:29:21] detronizator: and if you want to rewrite it from scratch, be my guest too :)
[15:29:44] jimevans: i'll try that, but i'm sure there are subtleties that a simple replacement will not handle.
[15:32:08] barancev: would you mind if I implement ability to make driver.switchTo().frame("_parent") and driver.switchTo().frame("_top") ?
[15:33:29] barancev: (yes, second one is the same as switch to default content, so may be it is excessive)
[15:33:32] dawagner: barancev: How does switchTo().frame("_top") differ from whichever of switchTo().defaultConte[nx]t exista?
[15:34:00] barancev: for uniformity :)
[15:34:08] dawagner: I think parent could be handy, but I'd personally prefer a different method to a a magic string value
[15:34:17] barancev: to always use switchTo().frame
[15:34:18] dawagner: simonstewart will probably tell you neither is necessary, though :)
[15:34:36] simonstewart: dawagner: damn right I would
[15:34:48] simonstewart: There are already two easy ways to do it using the existing api
[15:35:03] barancev: two ways to switch to parent frame?
[15:35:04] simonstewart: (one using xpath, one using the jsexecutor)
[15:35:12] simonstewart: Ahhh. that
[15:35:19] simonstewart: Thought we were talking about elements
[15:35:24] barancev: no, frames
[15:35:28] simonstewart: I still don't think it's necessary
[15:35:39] simonstewart: We're not writing a general DOM walking solution
[15:35:49] simonstewart: You should Know Where You Are At All Times
[15:36:23] simonstewart: And that includes knowing just how you got to focus on this particular frame
[15:37:08] barancev: yes, but if you have several levels of iframes embedded it's hard to walk to the top and the inside-inside-inside
[15:37:31] simonstewart: Really?
[15:37:55] simonstewart: switchToFrameFromTop("one", "child", 2);
[15:38:02] simonstewart: One helper method later and you're done

[15:48:43] Loof: Anyone have a good example of setting up selenium on the node as a windows service?
[15:48:52] jimevans: Loof: don't.
[15:49:14] Loof: jimevans: Ok, what's the general suggestion for remotely managing the node then?
[15:49:56] jimevans: longer answer. there are enough differences with running a process as a service vs. as a regular user, that it's almost guaranteed to run into unexpected behavior.
[15:50:08] jimevans: what does "remotely managing the node" mean?
[15:50:30] Loof: That means I don't want to have to log in via RDP and manually kill and restart (or start on boot) the selenium process.
[15:50:31] jimevans: i know what i think of with that phrase, but i want to know what your needs are.
[15:51:06] Loof: I want a mechanism that allows selenium to start on boot consistently (the 'startup folder' is not an answer for that on 'modern' windows server)
[15:51:13] jimevans: i've heard of people having decent success using the windows task scheduler.
[15:51:28] Loof: and I really want a mechanism that let's me shut down and restart selenium on changes
[15:51:51] jimevans: i've heard of others using psexec with success too.
[15:52:03] jimevans: shutdown is pretty easy.
[15:52:40] jimevans: there's an http end point that will shut the server down.
[15:52:50] Loof: BTW, most of the example configs show the local IP being specified in the config for registration... it SEEMS like selenium auto-detects it if it isn't specified
[15:53:00] Loof: Yes, shut it down... but then how do you start it up again :)
[15:53:26] jimevans: puppet? chef? psexec? task scheduler? 
[15:53:48] Loof: I've got chef, it wants to set it up as a service :)
[15:54:10] jimevans: it wants to set *what* up as a service? selenium? or chef itself?
[15:54:13] Loof: Well, let me rephrase that
[15:54:23] *jimevans doesn't know chef that well.
[15:54:43] Loof: All of the examples of chef managing a windows program... including the chef client itself... wrap a 'service' wrapper around the exec
[15:54:57] Loof: I'm using winsw... selenium seems to be running just fine (from a batch file even)
[15:55:07] Loof: but now I need to figure out how to restart, etc
[15:58:55] AutomatedTester: we truly live in the future... my iPhive was taken off the charger yesterday at 7am. Was switched off between 11pm and 8am, and is still running on the same charge
[15:59:50] jimevans: detronizator: did you close my switchTo().window() pull request on purpose?

[16:00:50] jimevans: ah. i though it might be something like that.
[16:01:29] jimevans: i'm not entirely sure how to slip a "SessionHavingReqHandler" class into the class hierarchy.
[16:03:19] detronizator: I know: it's tricky to do class hierarchies when you got objects, not classes. If you can't, I can do it myself. In that case, just reopen (sorry!) the pull request, I'll merge and take it from there

[16:22:03] simonstewart: I think if you can get them to pass locally in a full test run it should be okay
[16:22:19] Loof: So, back to selenium issues... jimevans do you have windows selenium nodes that are not managed directly (i.e. a person sitting at the windows box to start selenium server)

[20:01:35] pukerat: nobody wants to chat ? : (
[20:04:03] AutomatedTester: pukerat: people will answer as and when they look at the channel
[20:04:26] AutomatedTester: a lot of people have experience working with the hub
[20:04:50] stephend: pukerat: yo
[20:04:53] stephend: what's up?
[20:08:09] pukerat: ok good
[20:08:15] pukerat: so i got some logic issue with timeouts
[20:08:21] pukerat: Here is what happens:
[20:09:02] pukerat: I issue more tests then i have available nodes for a particular environment (i can explain why i do this)
[20:09:13] pukerat: Some tests get placed into a queue on the hub
[20:09:41] pukerat: Eventually, they may timeout waiting for a node to become available. When they do time out, they do not remove themselves from the queue in the hub
[20:10:04] pukerat: eventually when the hub does have an environment available, it will move that session request from the queue and give it to the available environment
[20:10:19] santiycr has joined #selenium
[20:10:48] pukerat: except the test that was waiting for that environment is timed out long ago. The session then sits there for the duration of the timeout specified on the particular environment. After that it will put itself back into available.
[20:11:03] pukerat: When it does this, it opens an internet explorer... and leave it open. It does not clean up after itself
[20:11:13] pukerat: So there are a few issues here
[20:12:32] pukerat: First is that the hub does not know when a request has timed out. It will continue to leave it in the queue. Second, when it spawns an internet explorer for one of these dead requests in the queue, it will open a browser, leave it open for the full timeout and then leave it open
[20:13:30] pukerat: Third, because of that logic, it means that my timeout for a request for a webdriver environment needs to be significantly longer then the timeout of particular environments or i will eventually just fill up a queue with dead requests.
[20:13:55] pukerat: And lastly, the only way to do this is to specify the webdriver command timeout. Which i dont see how to change after ive already created an instance.
[20:14:14] AutomatedTester: pukerat: what is the first thing timing out?
[20:14:21] AutomatedTester: is it your test runner?
[20:14:59] pukerat: The first thing timing out is the constructor for RemoveWebDriver
[20:15:23] pukerat: it is timing out because there is no heartbeat ( i dont think) sent while it is in queue on the hub
[20:15:51] pukerat: when it times out, it doesn't remove itself from the hub queue
[20:16:30] AutomatedTester: pukerat: are you sure that RemoteWebDriver is timing out?
[20:16:43] pukerat: it is throwing a timeout exception
[20:16:57] pukerat: OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriverException: No response from server for url http://prdev-goliath:4444/wd/hub/session    at OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.HttpCommandExecutor.CreateResponse(WebRequest request)    at OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.RemoteWebDriver.Execute(String driverCommandToExecute, Dictionary`2 parameters)    at OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.RemoteWebDriver..ctor(ICommandExecutor commandExecutor, ICapabilities desiredCapabilities) 
[20:17:24] pukerat: i believe the timeout used there is the same used for all other webdriver command timeouts
[20:17:41] pukerat: and i think that can't really be reasonable
[20:17:57] pukerat: since webdriver command timeout should be less then your webdriver node timeout

[20:49:07] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: my manager tells me that FF is such a pleasure to automate with. Trying to get stuff to work with Chrome is a nightmare, bugs with some of the Javascript, baroque options handling and so on
[20:49:24] AutomatedTester: <£
[20:49:26] AutomatedTester: <3
[20:50:03] Dude-X: I don't like the bugs that have popped up with chromedriver/chrome recently either
[20:50:15] Dude-X: like the time they broke findElements

[21:00:02] barancev: and the true question is: do we win by moving driver development to vendors?
[21:00:20] timg: So, I've just started using selenium IDE and I'm trying to look for the best way to get it to select javascript objects in the application
[21:00:29] timg: I'm reading the selenium docs but the methods do not appear to work
[21:00:32] Dude-X: I get the impression that Google doesn't run a test suite similiar to the webdriver one? i don't know
[21:00:33] timg: surely I'm doing it wrong
[21:01:35] barancev: timg: sure you do :) selenium automated UI. javascript object are not the elements a user deal with. why do you want to get them?
[21:01:37] Dude-X: barancev: I would hope so, because they do have domain knowledge, but Google's recent track record has me worried.
[21:02:30] jimevans: Dude-X, barancev: that's where the standards effort comes in.
[21:02:49] timg: barancev: I guess I just don't know. I got firebug. I inspected the menu item. I found the xpath. I used it in selenium.. no luck
[21:03:55] jimevans: along with the standards effort comes a suite of tests (yet to be written) that can be used to validate a browser vendor's driver implementation.
[21:04:35] barancev: yes, with the standard we are on the right track.
[21:05:03] barancev: I understand that we shall win in future moving in this direction
[21:05:31] stephend: my team's gonna be writing marionette tests in a couple weeks or less, hopefully
[21:05:38] barancev: but atm googledriver is the least supported, imho
[21:05:40] stephend: should be fun
[21:06:03] stephend: so we'll be helping push that platform
[21:06:46] AutomatedTester: barancev: the good thing about with Selenium in Firefox (Marionette) is that Marionette will be the core for Firefox testing
[21:06:47] barancev: marionette tests != tests to conform to webdriver standard
[21:07:16] AutomatedTester: barancev: by that Logic, Selenium tests != tests to conform to the standard
[21:07:49] barancev: AutomatedTester: unfortunately, you're right
[21:07:58] barancev: selenium tests sometimes non-systematic
[21:08:13] AutomatedTester: yea but the same can be said for everything
[21:09:05] barancev: well, yes, moving to vendors have lots of technical pros
[21:10:23] barancev: but: separate issue trackers, no common continuous integration servers and no common picture, and other organizational cons are worrying me a bit
[21:10:42] jimevans: as the primary developer on a browser driver, and not one that has a special relationship with the browser vendor, i very much want the browser vendor to take up implementation.
[21:11:38] barancev: I'd like them be a part of the vendor and the part of the selenium project at the same time
[21:12:19] jimevans: so you want a common source repository, then.
[21:12:22] barancev: though, you're right with the standart is's  adifferent story
[21:12:44] AutomatedTester: so... the python code has been "owned" by Mozilla for a while
[21:12:54] barancev: jimevans: a kind of, yes, and common integration
[21:13:07] AutomatedTester: the Marionette implementation is going into the Firefox CI
[21:13:19] AutomatedTester: using what will be Selenium tests to make sure it doesnt break
[21:13:34] AutomatedTester: <- currently working on one of the issues
[21:14:04] jimevans: barancev: i don't think you can have it both ways. either you'll get browser vendors implementations, or you'll get contributions to the open-source selenium project, of varying quality because it's not "owned" by the browser vendor.
[21:14:22] jimevans: and in this case, i'm specifically talking about closed-source browser vendors.
[21:14:46] AutomatedTester: of which 1 participates
[21:14:48] AutomatedTester: 1 doesnt
[21:14:56] AutomatedTester: actually 2 dont
[21:15:33] jimevans: right.
[21:16:09] barancev: I dislike the current situation with chromedriver only, to be honest, that's opensource, but it does not help
[21:16:29] AutomatedTester: unlike Google, Mozilla wants its WebDriver implementation to be the core testing framework produced by the Productivity Engineering team
[21:16:38] AutomatedTester: or Automation and Tools team
[21:17:20] AutomatedTester: barancev: thats a Chromium OSS issue
[21:17:44] AutomatedTester: the chromium project doesnt have contributors joining like Mozilla does
[21:17:52] AutomatedTester: and Mozilla doesnt have enough of it
[21:18:05] barancev: technically -- yes, but from the "user point of view" -- it's selenium has bad support for chrome
[21:18:07] AutomatedTester: but we have many more years of getting contributors than Google do
[21:18:49] jimevans: barancev: it is open source, so the answer there is, as always, "submit a patch". the ongoing question is how big does your pain have to be to overcome the learning curve of contributing to their platform?
[21:19:26] jimevans: we're going to need to begin an education campaign to let people know where responsibilities lie.
[21:19:47] AutomatedTester: the other thing is down to language used to develop
[21:20:03] barancev: as soon as we have "atoms" in selenium project and "driver" in chromium project -- the code is distributed between two projects
[21:20:42] AutomatedTester: barancev: atoms are not always the answer fwiw
[21:20:50] jimevans: there's no rule that says an implementer has to use the atoms.
[21:21:15] AutomatedTester: I have actually removed 1 atom from Marionette because the more native implemation was much much better
[21:22:11] jimevans: if chromium chooses to use the atoms, that's their prerogative, but it should be incumbent upon them to make sure the atoms perform properly for whatever functionality in their browser.
[21:22:43] barancev: but if they do use atoms, and we fix something -- we have to push vendors to update atoms, and this cycle should be short enough, no?
[21:24:30] jimevans: ideally, it shouldn't be the selenium project maintaining the atoms. remember, the long-term vision is for the webdriver project to virtually cease to be, except for its test cases.
[21:24:37] barancev: and when we fix atoms, we should be able to check that the changes don't break vendor's drivers
[21:26:23] AutomatedTester: so... the atoms are/were being pulled to their own OSS project
[21:26:43] AutomatedTester: so we fix it there then it needs to be updated in the Selenium tree 
[21:26:48] AutomatedTester: and elsewhere
[21:27:14] barancev: the atoms are/were being pulled to their own OSS project ... that'll have the same organizational issues
[21:27:35] KaibutsuX: you guys have any idea on a timeframe for 2.26 release yet?
[21:27:54] barancev: huh... you're cooling :)

[21:29:44] bingomanatee: Can anyone help a N00b get started with Selenium?
[21:29:53] bingomanatee: I have two things at this point 
[21:30:00] bingomanatee: the selenium2 setup with maven
[21:30:12] bingomanatee: and a firefox java class that I produced using the Selenium IDE.
[21:30:14] KaibutsuX: barancev: was that directed at me?
[21:30:32] bingomanatee: I don't really know how to get said class/script into the project I generated or to execute it. 
[21:31:05] barancev: KaibutsuX: yes, a good question about today's issues when we talked about tomorrow :)
[21:32:32] KaibutsuX: I think my brain just cored trying to parse that sentence :)
[21:33:38] barancev: hope 2.26 is soon, jimevans took the bakon
[21:34:23] KaibutsuX: ahh
[21:34:35] barancev: and ff16 is soon too, btw
[21:34:52] barancev: who is faster?
[21:34:53] KaibutsuX: are they planning anything major for FF?
[21:36:28] KaibutsuX: I just now went from 14>15, i see it still doesn't respect Arial Black for font-family
[21:45:26] jimevans: barancev: are you still planning on looking into the ci firefox native events failures.
[21:45:29] jimevans: ?
[21:48:10] barancev: jimevans: on the next week, I hope
