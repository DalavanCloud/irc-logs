[08:10:00] dekroning: hi
[08:14:21] dekroning: is there like a test runner, which I can use to test an external website, and also keep track of the number of parallel tests, and orchastrate the execution order etc?
[08:16:22] kallisti: dekroning: I don't know much about Selenium Grid, but I think that sounds applicable.
[08:18:24] detronizator has joined #selenium
[08:18:56] Ardesco has joined #selenium
[08:24:13] dekroning: kallisti: but where right the "driver" which drives the selenium grid in this case?
[08:29:45] generalconsensus has joined #selenium
[08:33:56] dhpe: dekroning: what is your use case exactly?
[08:39:51] freynaud has joined #selenium
[08:45:26] dekroning: dhpe: our platform is distributed, and we would like to have a single integration suite, that runs throughs the whole application
[08:46:34] dekroning: dhpe: I would really like for each full suite run, to start with fresh installation. Then I want it to setup the whole application as a regular user would do, so I will have some tests that are dependant on other tests to have run already, like "account setup" etc
[08:46:57] dekroning: dhpe: but at some point in time, when all setup has been done, I could run tests in parallel
[08:48:46] kallisti: dekroning: http://selenium-grid.seleniumhq.org/
[08:50:09] dekroning: kallisti: I can just use the WebDriver with selenium-grid right? or is there a grid specific API that I need to use ?
[08:51:13] kallisti: I know almost as much as you do, honestly
[08:52:22] barancev: it's fucking wrong link, read http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2
[08:52:46] barancev: yes, Grid2 works with WebDriver (as well as RC)
[08:52:49] dekroning: barancev: thanks ;-) 
[08:53:18] barancev: what language do you use? and what testing framework (to run tests in parallel)?
[08:53:32] barancev: morning all, btw :)
[08:54:02] dekroning: barancev: ideally we would like to keep using Ruby... even more ideally I would like to use Cucumber + Selenium
[08:54:24] dekroning: barancev: but in the end, we need a good solution, so if it means that the Java library works better or something, we should use that instead
[08:55:14] dekroning: afaik with cucumber you can't specify the order in which things run, because it's build to run tests in isolation. But I can ofcourse use a ugly hack like naming all my features files with some alphabetic ordering
[08:55:14] barancev: all webdriver language bindings are roughly same
[08:55:23] teodosia_sel has joined #selenium
[08:55:24] dekroning: barancev: great so Ruby isn't a problem then 
[08:55:38] kallisti: just use the remote webdriver
[08:56:12] barancev: the important part for you is ability of a test tramwork to order test sand run them in parallel
[08:57:00] barancev: I have used parallel_tests for Rspec, not sure if it is possible to use it with cucumber too
[08:57:04] barancev: https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests
[08:58:04] dekroning: barancev: well, at a certain point I would like to run tests in parallel, say we have like a "webshop" type of platform, first I want some tests, to singup the account, add all the products and only when all this setup is done, have for example multiple threads testing the shop as clients
[08:58:59] barancev: so learn your testing framework abilities, cucumber or rspec in your case
[08:59:28] barancev: in Java you can try TestNG, it provides good configuration features out of the box
[08:59:46] dekroning: yeah I have heard people talk about TestNG more often indeed
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Sep 18 09:01:10 2012]
[09:01:10] barancev: JUnit is highly usable too, but you need to learn how to use @Rule s to get all the power of JUnit
[09:04:46] Ammar has joined #selenium
[09:05:43] dekroning: barancev: I read in some places that the Java drivers are the most stable vs Ruby selenium drivers
[09:06:02] dekroning: was trying to look up the link I found, but can't find it quickly enough
[09:06:33] andreastt: dekroning: Everything maps down to the same WebDriver implementations, so there shouldn't be any big difference between them.
[09:06:45] andreastt: Oh, and hello by the way (-:
[09:06:49] dekroning: hi andreastt :)
[09:07:41] barancev: there are some differences between language bindings -- browser lancher implementation, network issues, but the webdriver core is the same for all the bindings

[09:08:35] dekroning: ok
[09:09:03] dekroning: what exaclty is TestNG is it something like Rspec? 
[09:09:12] dekroning: or is TestNG more of a test runner?
[09:09:30] barancev: it's a test runner
[09:10:14] barancev: andreastt: you told opera mobile can be installed on the desktop to run selenium tests, is it real opera mobile or emulator?
[09:12:03] andreastt: Define “real” (-:
[09:13:06] barancev: hm... well.. are there known differences in behaviour between mobile mobile and desktop mobile versions?
[09:13:35] andreastt: Shouldn't be any difference in behaviour.
[09:13:43] dekroning: what are you guys using as test runner?
[09:14:10] andreastt: But it's obviously running on a different processor architecture on devices, so that might have some impact especially wrt to ECMAScript.
[09:14:38] barancev: andreastt: is there some readme how to connect selenium to desktop mobile opera?
[09:15:16] andreastt: There is!

[09:16:09] barancev: thanks!
[09:16:44] andreastt: Note that it's a little sensitive on paths to the binary on OS X.
[09:16:53] andreastt: I should say that.
[09:17:17] barancev: I'm on win+lin. want to try it in advance to be ready for 2.26 :)
[09:17:20] dekroning: anyone of you using Cucumber with selenium by chance?
[09:18:04] barancev: I personally dislike BDD all at all :)
[09:19:19] barancev: too much overhead
[09:20:24] andreastt: +1
[09:20:44] andreastt: Although I can see the use case for flow-based user interfaces, like web apps.

[10:38:24] OperaDriver has left #selenium
[10:40:18] Dude-X_: well here's an example: we have a jQuery overlay that opens up, by rendering an 'animation', then it renders the loading dialog box, then does AJAX to load the data. So my wait statement executes javascript to wait for the dialog to stop animating using jQuery commands and then it waits for the loader to disappear, and then wait for some consistent last element to appear
[10:41:43] Dude-X_: this works very well, but if i have to deal with other JS widgets, I'd have to use similar patterns to get test stability
[10:42:28] AutomatedTester: Dude-X_: tbh, I think that falls on the JS widget creators to make it testable

[11:18:01] bsilwal: AutomatedTester: Yes using that atm.
[11:18:01] dawagner: andreastt: Hello!
[11:18:07] simonstewart: First thing to do is to find out what's happening
[11:18:15] andreastt: dawagner: What happens is that the C++ wrapper in OD execs xvfb-run which apparently forks Xvfb.  So we loose track of which binary we control.
[11:18:36] bsilwal: Tell him open sourcing is the only way to increase stock prices :D
[11:18:41] andreastt: dawagner: Since Opera Mobile doesn't allow OD to instruct it to quit, we need to kill it.  So we end up killing xvfb-run instead of Xvfb/operamobile.
[11:18:45] AutomatedTester: bsilwal: LOL...
[11:18:51] dawagner: That sounds sub-optimal... So running Xvfb and just happening to set the DISPLAY would work much better?

[11:21:14] dawagner: Cool, thanks :)
[11:21:19] andreastt: It's possibly related to the window/instance cleanup we do.
[11:21:47] dawagner: That reads a lot like when the AndroidDriver has issues where the WebView wasn't initialised properly, and an exception happened on a background thread, but I'm sure they're unrelated
[11:22:06] andreastt: Yes, I'm thinking along the same lines
[11:22:57] simonstewart: dawagner: was there some plan to move the sites to app engine?
[11:23:07] simonstewart: That stalled because of some dependency or another?

[12:17:01] simonstewart: sure
[12:17:16] simonstewart: (biab)
[12:17:54] andreastt: If I want to expose something non-WebDriver there (Opera specific), and I want to send an enumerated/repeated args list (of unknown size), what would be the best way to do that in JSON?
[12:18:15] simonstewart: Use the "o-" prefix on the command name
[12:18:25] andreastt: The backend for the particular feature I want to expose uses a comma-separated list, but that isn't particularly nice to use in Java.
[12:18:25] simonstewart: And then have a parameter be a list
[12:18:47] simonstewart: That would seem to fit your requirements.
[12:19:03] simonstewart: Really will be biab

[13:04:41] dawagner: IME the common case is you already have a capabilities that you want to add settings to

[13:07:40] AutomatedTester: dawagner: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/common/proxy.py?#123 the capabilities are never returned
[13:07:54] AutomatedTester: so you add them but they dont get added where you would want them
[13:08:32] AutomatedTester: so if I have a proxy and give it to webdriver and call add_to_capabilities() it adds it but the object stays in there

[13:11:33] dawagner: capabilities = {} ; proxy.add_to_capabilities(capabilities) ; self.assertIn('proxy', capabilities) will pass
[13:11:58] AutomatedTester: ok, doing that in webdriver.py it doesnt do what you think it does
[13:12:27] simonstewart: andreastt: the command name should be prefixed "o-". Having "/o/" in the url makes sense too

[13:17:31] AutomatedTester: the capabilities from the proxy dont get returned
[13:18:23] AutomatedTester: let me try again
[13:18:31] simonstewart: Ardesco: Any reason you broke out the inner classes to public top-level ones?
[13:19:48] Ardesco: made it easier for me to follow what was going on in them, made it less monolithic and in my opinion easier to add another converter at a later date if needed
[13:19:57] Ardesco: all purely selfish reasons

[15:20:17] dekroning: andreastt: that talk is intresting, still makes me wonder about how to correctly isolate tests, when you have a big platform. Also our webinterfac and api's are a bit more stable, then the datastructes at the moment, because we refector still a lot internally
[15:20:32] AutomatedTester: look kids... http://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/49cc2fef3a62

[15:34:31] dekroning: anyone know where I can find how to use Page Objects and PageFactory in Ruby on the selenium site it self?
[15:34:46] andreastt: I'm unsure how to ignore the failing tests on Windows + Opera since it's a bug in the browser, but I want them to be run on other platforms.

[16:31:20] RandLAT: I'm using WebDriver with Java. Is there a trick to do "fast" exception catching? When WebDriver doesn't find what I ask it to locate, it generally freezes for the full duration of the implicit wait I configured Firefox with. Is there a way to speed this process up?
[16:31:49] simonstewart: No. That's what an implicit wait _does_
[16:31:58] simonstewart: It waits for up to the timeout for the thing to appear

[18:10:14] jimevans: but looking at locator_test.html, and the failures reports on the CI server, it looks like wgxpath is throwing an exception, as it should. the atom catches it, and rethrows a new bot.Error with the correct error code. however, when the atoms test runs in IE6, it's failing saying that ex.code is undefined instead of the expected value.
[18:12:57] simonstewart: jimevans: vanishingly tiny. 
[18:13:08] jimevans: simonstewart: hey!
[18:13:15] simonstewart: Hey
[18:13:22] jimevans: so the problem isn't with wgxpath after all, i don't think
[18:13:28] simonstewart: Google apps don't support IE6. 
[18:13:33] simonstewart: k
[18:13:40] jimevans: it's in our atom
[18:13:41] dawagner: Or IE8, any more.
[18:13:43] simonstewart: It's with the atoms by the sound of ti
[18:13:50] simonstewart: Well, that's apps
[18:13:58] Dude-X: simonstewart: your blog has two "the"'s
[18:13:58] simonstewart: I bet search still support it :)
[18:14:06] dawagner: Unfortunately :P
[18:14:13] jimevans: but i don't have any way to debug the IE6 issue.
[18:14:24] jimevans: got a meeting. back in a bit.
[18:14:33] simonstewart: Dude-X: fixed :)
[18:14:45] jimevans: if anybody who *can* look at atoms failures in IE6 wants to take a look, I'd be grateful.
[18:14:53] simonstewart: Thank you for spotting it and pointing it out
[18:15:02] simonstewart: Hmm… 
[18:15:18] simonstewart: wonder how to get the MS testing VMs running on OS X
[18:16:32] simonstewart: :google i.e. application compatibility vac image os x

[18:57:55] detronizator: dont' bother
[18:58:07] detronizator: you shouldn't see a difference: it was a "cleanup" task for qtwebkit
[18:58:15] detronizator: do the full rebuild tonight before going to sleep ;)
[18:58:24] detronizator: in the meantime, try out the frame and cookie stuff
[18:58:27] jimevans: alright. fair enough.
[18:58:45] jimevans: i'll run the tests using the .NET bindings.

[19:00:19] jimevans: well, no, i need a new phantomjs, right?
[19:00:33] jimevans: for the frames changes?

[19:08:24] jimevans: excellent!
[19:08:51] jimevans: detronizator: so i think i do need a full phantomjs rebuild. 
[19:08:56] jimevans: for the frames api changes.
[19:09:07] detronizator: yes, but only phantomjs
[19:09:11] detronizator: not the whole qt shananigans
[19:09:59] dawagner: detronizator: Is there an easy way to build phantomjs with a custom include path? I gave it a go, and it didn't seem to listen to environment variables, or settings in the .pro files
[19:10:08] jimevans: unfortunately, that didn't work for me. i got compiler errors.
[19:13:09] jimevans: dawagner: what are you trying to accomplish? why would you need a custom include path? (or are you trying to build with an existing qtwebkit lib?)
[19:15:22] dawagner: I have a system with an intentionally unusual filesystem layout, which I'd like to compile on
[19:15:34] jimevans: ah. i see.
[19:18:02] jimevans: detronizator: i'm very happy with the state of the cookies api. that's working fantastically. green across the board with the .NET bindings' CookieImplementationTest.
[19:18:24] detronizator: I'm glad I can finally say: YESSSSS!
[19:18:52] detronizator: jimevans: just submitted the pull request to merge my latest work in ghostdriver-dev into phantomjs/master

[19:59:16] chrisculver701: this is creating a htmlunit remotewebdriver
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Sep 18 20:02:17 2012]
[20:02:17] jimevans: chrisculver701: is the java remote server running on the same machine?
[20:02:51] chrisculver701: should be
[20:03:05] chrisculver701: instantiating it by the xample: driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri("http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub"), DesiredCapabilities.HtmlUnit());
[20:03:29] chrisculver701: to use htmlunit do i need to fire up the server manually?
[20:03:36] jimevans: chrisculver701: no, you have to manually fire up the server.
[20:03:42] chrisculver701: ah
[20:03:46] chrisculver701: bummer
[20:03:58] chrisculver701: no way to use htmlunit w/o the selenium server?
[20:04:01] jimevans: the machine is refusing connection because you don't have anything listening on 4444
[20:04:03] jimevans: nope.
[20:04:05] jimevans: sorry.
[20:04:15] jimevans: if you want headless, wait for ghostdriver.
[20:04:16] jimevans: :)
[20:04:19] chrisculver701: hah
[20:04:28] chrisculver701: is that related to phantomjs?
[20:04:28] dfstrauss has joined #selenium
[20:04:31] chrisculver701: i saw you guys talking about
[20:04:49] jimevans: chrisculver701: that's exactly it.
[20:04:59] chrisculver701: nice
[20:05:13] chrisculver701: whats the timeline on that like?
[20:06:46] jimevans: i think phantomjs 1.7 will be able to run ghostdriver (the webdriver API for phantomjs) without a custom build. phantomjs 1.7 should be out in the next couple of weeks.
[20:07:32] jimevans: if you give me a few hours, i can tell you how closely the phantomjs driver performs with respect to other driver implementations.
[20:07:53] chrisculver701: alright, i'd like that. Thanks for the info
[20:08:16] jimevans: watch this space. i'll post my test results here.
