[04:52:53] selbot2_: 03jmleyba half a minute ago - JasonLeyba: When an object is returned from a script, convert any function properties to strings instead of throwing an error.

[05:04:53] selbot2_: 03jmleyba half a minute ago - JasonLeyba: r17879 exposed a bug in the SafariDriver: switching to a frame by index and name/ID are two distinct cases.

[07:10:54] selbot2_: 03jmleyba half a minute ago - JasonLeyba: Per r17687, our users can't be bothered to track whether they've called quit, so we must protect against them calling quit multiple times. Would be better to throw IllegalStateException on any operation after a quit() and force users to fix their tests, but this behavior has been enshrined in tests, so... | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=17889 | http://seleniumhq.org/ci.jsp?r=17889
