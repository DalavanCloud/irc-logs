[02:29:16] kallisti: dhpe: there is a webdriver command to set the window size
[02:29:27] kallisti: dhpe: what language are you using?
[02:30:54] kallisti: nyx114: there should be an option to specify a custom extension. I believe the Ruby, Java, and C# bindings support that.
[02:31:12] kallisti: or rather, a custom profile.
[02:31:18] kallisti: not an extension, but you can do that as part of the profile.
[02:31:47] nyx114: kallisti: is this regarding my anonymous profile question?
[02:31:50] kallisti: yes
[02:32:00] kallisti: if you don't specify a profile, it creates a new temporary one
[02:32:26] nyx114: so i just have to use
[02:32:26] nyx114: webdriverinterface driver = new FirefoxDriver(new FirefoxProfile());
[02:32:41] kallisti: Java or C#?
[02:33:06] kallisti: the class names are the same for both, I believe
[02:33:25] nyx114: c#
[02:33:32] nyx114: IWebDriver is the interface
[02:33:37] kallisti: right
[02:33:40] nyx114: tyvm
[02:33:50] kallisti: no problem.
[02:33:55] nyx114: one more question
[02:34:04] *kallisti is currently working on changes to the Haskell libraries.
[02:34:13] nyx114: can i use the switchto() function to switch tabs?
[02:34:22] kallisti: I don't think so
[02:34:26] kallisti: frames
[02:34:43] nyx114: aww ok
[02:34:50] kallisti: that being said:
[02:34:51] nyx114: i would have to create a new window?
[02:35:00] kallisti: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Marionette
[02:35:03] kallisti: nyx114: believe so
[02:35:07] nyx114: ok
[02:35:28] nyx114: is the footprint considerably greater?
[02:35:34] kallisti: speaking of which I should make sure my client is compatible with Marionette
[02:35:50] kallisti: nyx114: no idea, honestly
[02:36:06] nyx114: well thank you for your help
[02:37:50] kallisti: nyx114: a nice feature of Marionette is the higher privileged javascript evaluation.
[02:38:06] nyx114: i dont entirely understand what that means.
[02:38:08] ian_mac has joined #selenium
[02:38:30] kallisti: javascript can access the browser UI
[02:38:47] kallisti: so, you could make tabs, for example.
[02:38:53] nyx114: oh wow
[02:39:01] nyx114: i thought js was restricted
[02:39:08] nyx114: this may be useful
[02:39:27] kallisti: "This means you can run any JS script in chrome or in content. This is a powerful feature, enabling a user to do anything from inspecting the content DOM of a Firefox instance running in a remote machine to executing a script that changes profile preferences in privileged chrome space."
[02:39:55] kallisti: I should take advantage of this functionality.
[02:40:09] nyx114: i wish webdriver had it
[02:40:10] nyx114: :/
[02:40:20] nyx114: im not much of a programmer tbh
[02:40:25] nyx114: im a newbie
[02:40:37] kallisti: well, Marionette is just a modified form of the WebDriver API
[02:40:58] nyx114: but it's vendor supported
[02:41:14] kallisti: sure
[02:42:09] kallisti: I'm basically just looking for ways to improve Haskell libraries right now.
[02:42:14] nyx114: oh
[02:42:23] nyx114: why are there so many implementations?
[02:42:35] nyx114: is it just a single implementation with a wrapper?
[02:42:36] kallisti: multi-language support is good on paper.
[02:43:02] kallisti: nyx114: for the most part, though there are a few non-Selenium servers.
[02:43:03] nyx114: till you end up with inconsistencies like javascript
[02:43:06] kallisti: like chromedriver
[02:44:02] nyx114: i cant believe that make automated testing their expertise
[02:44:16] nyx114: there are so many people*
[02:44:32] kallisti: I actually just use webdriver to automate my browser to do something I dont want to do.
[02:44:39] nyx114: same xD
[02:45:04] nyx114: im using it to check whether my teacher has uploaded an assignment
[02:45:34] nyx114: im too lazy to login myself and check
[02:45:47] nyx114: so DMZd my laptop
[02:45:57] nyx114: and connect to it from my cell phone
[02:46:18] nyx114: then i can tell it to launch a bat file which contains the automation
[02:46:45] nyx114: in retrospect, it seems like more work than just logging in
[02:46:53] nyx114: :/
[02:47:04] kallisti: usually
[02:47:08] nyx114: xD
[02:47:12] nyx114: i learned xpath
[02:47:17] kallisti: yep
[02:47:17] nyx114: and a bit of javascript
[02:47:25] nyx114: so it's a net positive for me
[02:48:18] nyx114: i can see why js is so popular
[02:48:22] nyx114: it's very simple
[02:52:25] kallisti: I can see why Haskell is not popular, but it's incredibly powerful.
[02:55:06] nyx114: ive never tried haskell
[02:55:13] nyx114: gonna google it
[02:55:38] kallisti: nyx114: look at this documentation and tell me if you can read it. Just that one section of functions.  http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/webdriver/0.4/doc/html/Test-WebDriver-Commands.html#g:6
[02:56:08] nyx114: yup
[02:56:38] nyx114: it's understandable
[02:56:49] nyx114: Why 
[02:57:01] nyx114: doesnt this library use a class
[02:57:03] kallisti: because I'm working on this documentation
[02:57:09] kallisti: no there's not a class
[02:57:17] kallisti: there is an interface though, for the return type.
[02:57:24] nyx114: the selector should be inside the By
[02:57:25] nyx114: clas
[02:57:26] nyx114: s
[02:57:29] nyx114: oh
[02:57:33] nyx114: :/
[02:57:39] nyx114: the class seemed easier
[02:57:48] nyx114: polymorphism has always confused me
[02:57:59] kallisti: this isn't polymorphic, it's multiple constructors for the same type
[02:58:16] kallisti: you can write a Selector as ById "blah", ByName "foo", ByClass "bar", etc
[02:58:21] nyx114: oh
[02:58:35] nyx114: that makes sense
[02:58:39] kallisti: and then you have a case "statement" that can pick apart a type by its constructors and match fields to variables
[02:59:11] kallisti: but, anyway
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Sep 17 03:00:51 2012]
[03:00:51] nyx114: you have to do that yourself?
[03:00:53] nyx114: O_O
[03:01:05] kallisti: er, yes, or use a function that does it for you
[03:01:06] nyx114: in c#, it does it automatically
[03:01:32] kallisti: well I did make Selector part of the ToJSON interface
[03:01:49] kallisti: so that it can be directly translated into JSON
[03:03:05] nyx114: oh ok
[03:03:10] nyx114: reading up on haskell
[03:03:18] nyx114: it seems difficult
[03:03:43] kallisti: yes, it's not easy to learn, because it's very different.
[03:04:50] nyx114: i think that's it
[03:04:53] nyx114: functional programming
[03:05:10] kallisti: yep, thats the idea.
[03:05:21] nyx114: c# has lambda expressions
[03:05:25] nyx114: that's about it
[03:05:40] nyx114: isnt functional programming slower than imperative?
[03:07:14] kallisti: well, Haskell is compiled to machine code, for example, and it runs much faster than Python. it's around the same speed range as C# or Java
[03:07:20] kallisti: though sometimes it can be as fast as C.
[03:07:42] kallisti: it's got a wickedly good optimizer. SBCL, a Lisp compiler, is another example for a dynamic functional language.
[03:09:07] nyx114: i presume haskell also uses a ton of memory
[03:11:41] kallisti: yes, without garbage collection.
[03:12:12] kallisti: memory leaks are common because of the lazy evaluation.
[03:15:34] kallisti: there's a tool to profile memory usage that I use to debug stuff like that.
[03:23:07] kallisti: nyx114: http://gabrielprioli.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/using-a-business-readable-language-for-browser-automation/  here's a few examples, along with a second library that I don't fully understand. >_>
[03:25:40] nyx114: that is so weird
[03:25:42] nyx114: O___O
[03:26:01] kallisti: the session is entirely implicit
[03:26:07] nyx114: there are arrows pointing everywhere
[03:26:24] kallisti: you're basically invoking commands, where a session is implied
[03:26:42] kallisti: openPage "http://www.google.com"
[03:27:08] nyx114: what is When
[03:27:12] nyx114: and Given
[03:27:21] kallisti: I am not really sure. I'm reading it as metadata, for a testing system
[03:27:27] nyx114: ah ok
[03:27:30] kallisti: you describe conditions/behaviors of the software
[03:27:36] kallisti: then each block is the actual code, using webdriver
[03:27:47] kallisti: it's part of another library.
[03:28:01] kallisti: you're looking at 2 Haskell APIs stuck together.
[03:28:49] nyx114: stuck together as in passing each other data. or having a middle man deal with the data?
[03:29:01] nyx114: it feels like im looking at russian
[03:29:02] nyx114: xD

[IRC logfile - Started Mon Sep 17 11:00:10 2012]
[11:00:10] dawagner: The bit I can remember is you can now flip a flag on the server to tell logs to stay around, so you can get logs after a session has been killed
[11:00:35] dawagner: I think there were improvements with what you can get out of the firefoxdriver

[13:09:14] dhpe: bwaine: by using the capability "chrome.switches" you may pass command line arguments to chrome.
[13:10:13] bwaine: dhpe: How do I do this when starting the server. Currently I'm running: java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.25.0.jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/Users/bwaine/selenium/chromedriver
[13:10:29] omaciel has joined #selenium
[13:10:43] bwaine: i tried adding another -Dwebdriver.chrome.switches="--switch-name=switchvalue"
[13:10:50] bwaine: it didn't work though :-/
[13:11:05] dhpe: the capabilities are defined by the webdriver client requesting for a new session.
[13:11:18] dhpe: e.g. "desired capabilities"
[13:11:53] dhpe: for more info, check: http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/wiki/CapabilitiesAndSwitches
[13:12:18] dhpe: I mentioned the option 2
[13:12:31] dhpe: but there are two ways to implement that as described on the page.
[13:13:47] bwaine: I'm using Behat/Mink. Mink provides an abstraction over various UI testing tools. So I'm likely to find somewhere in it's selenium driver something similar to the java example you linked to?
[13:14:39] dhpe: that i cannot answer.

[19:50:47] jarib: then what's the argument for waiting for the next release?

[22:32:52] chrisculver701: is driver.Quit() the best way to close out at the end of tests?
[22:33:34] Dude-X: depends… if you want to start a brand new driver for every test
[22:33:39] Dude-X: or continue using the same browser
[22:33:59] lucabox has joined #selenium
[22:34:31] chrisculver701: after all the tests
[22:34:32] Dude-X: in my test suite we keep the same instance for all tests
[22:34:38] chrisculver701: i do too
[22:35:04] Dude-X: then yes, use driver.quit(), with firefox, for example, it will clean up the anonymous profile it creates
[22:35:14] chrisculver701: thanks
[22:36:17] Dude-X: a good thing to is to make quitting the driver a configurable option
[22:36:22] Dude-X: so that you can debug failing tests
[22:36:33] Dude-X: when a test ends, you want the browser window open
[22:36:49] chrisculver701: interesting point
[22:37:18] Dude-X: only downside, you have to clean up anonymous profiles, but not always an issue with some browsers
[22:37:40] Dude-X: every once in a while i just do a rm -rf /tmp/anonymous*

[22:41:08] chrisculver701: is there a way to ask the driver to tell you if it has been closed?
[22:41:21] chrisculver701: because driver.quit() doens't make it null
[22:41:39] chrisculver701: getwindowhandle()?
[22:46:22] maksim_ has joined #selenium
[22:47:20] Dude-X: well it would throw an exception like browser is unreachable
[22:47:25] maksim_: hi , i keep getting this error with my automated tests: error message is: Permission denied for <http://www.facebook.com> to get property HTMLMetaElement.name , i looked in the documentation but couldnt find a solution, please advice
[22:47:26] Dude-X: but  i am not sure of a uniform way
[22:50:18] Dude-X: maksim_: i'm about to leave but there's an issue filed in the selenium google code page. there's a work around for that particular security issue by whitelisting that property
[22:50:45] maksim_: Dude-X: can you provide a url please?
[22:51:57] Dude-X: #53
[22:52:06] Dude-X: oh the bot is down :/

[22:54:38] Dude-X: oh :p
[22:54:49] maksim_: Can you help me with that error.. i have spent a day trying to figure out a solution :s
[22:55:10] jarib: maksim_: have you tried searching our issue tracker for "permission denied"?

[23:02:10] maksim_: jarib: am still not sure where is the solution .. the page only talks about an update to selenium that fixed it
[23:02:45] jarib: maksim_: what is the title of the issue?
[23:03:30] maksim_: jarib: ok my bad :)

[23:07:54] maksim_: jarib: one last quetion
[23:08:46] jarib: make it count!
[23:08:53] maksim_: Adding to your FirefoxProfile the preference: capability.policy.default.Window.frameElement.get='allAccess' .. where is that done in firefox!?
[23:09:16] jarib: what language are you using?
[23:09:35] stephend: you set it as a desiredCapability, iirc
[23:09:42] stephend: we do it via JSON
[23:11:08] jarib: stephend: really? since when? never knew that was possible in webdriver.
