[03:14:46] codepython777: any ideas on how to fix this? Perhaps I need a clear cache command?

[06:34:55] freynaud: hello
[06:35:16] stephend: thought you *might* be interested in https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4507
[06:35:29] stephend: davehunt worked with zac to get the testcase last week
[06:37:07] freynaud: doesn't seem like a fun bug to work on ^^
[06:38:02] stephend: heh, no
[06:38:09] boianmm has joined #selenium
[06:38:15] stephend: it's driving us crazy, too
[06:38:21] freynaud: Similarly just running driver and not over grid this bug is unlikely to occur.
[06:38:48] freynaud: unlikely as in you saw it once, or unlikely has it never happened ?
[06:39:50] stephend: automatedtester asked zac to do that, and I don't know that he did, yet.  David told us "to just file for now" with the steps we had.  We'll do that part tomorrow, for sure, though.
[06:40:23] freynaud: i don't see those bugs in general because i always assume that something will go wrong, and i proactively restart all my nodes every 200 tests. It's a little overkill now because everything is much more stable, but 1 year ago, it saved a LOT of time
[06:40:36] martisj_ has joined #selenium
[06:40:40] stephend: yeah, I wish we had our ESX solution all rolled up and ready to go
[06:40:53] stephend: dave suggested we run against a debug version of selenium
[06:41:02] stephend: so we could get more logging
[06:41:38] stephend: zac didn't mention in there, but we've seen socket errors
[06:41:46] stephend: I think they're coming _after_ this problem occurs
[06:42:12] stephend: one browser instance open, listening on the same port, twice...
[06:43:29] krosenvold: stephend: The thing is there's some really futzy Mac-only code in the termination logic for ff ;) and i'm a Linux guy
[06:43:37] stephend: oh, really?
[06:43:43] stephend: that would explain why we don't see it on Windows
[06:43:46] stephend: we were kinda baffled...
[06:44:08] krosenvold: so you can have my address ;)
[06:44:47] freynaud: if that's the code you mentioned krosenvold , we should be able to see the same issue removing grid entirely
[06:45:13] krosenvold: maybe, maybe not
[06:45:24] stephend: wonder if roping in a mac firefox dev would help
[06:45:33] stephend: do we use IPC on mac, or something?
[06:45:55] krosenvold: remember hotspot
[06:46:34] krosenvold: it does things all the time, at least until the 30th invocation or so
[06:46:46] *stephend doesn't
[06:47:24] krosenvold: stephend: ;) hotspot is run-time optimizer in the JVM
[06:47:44] stephend: yeah, just looked it up.  I'm not technical enough to know what that really means, though :-)
[06:48:03] krosenvold: stephend: should be able to repro with just server, though
[06:48:20] rbalent has joined #selenium
[06:48:54] krosenvold: gandalf > hotspot > dumbledore
[06:49:14] stephend: ok, will mention that to zac.  Building debug/logging is recommended too?
[06:49:27] krosenvold: dunno
[06:51:31] stephend: any pointers to the mac code we could grok?
[06:52:01] stephend: both zac and dave can get java, thankfully

[13:37:42] AutomatedTester: andreastt: thats why we use it in crazy-fun
[13:37:53] AutomatedTester: its the least crappy build system
[13:38:32] andreastt: I wish it had built-in support for mtime stuff for files, though.
[13:38:47] andreastt: I guess that's not needed when you work in an interpreted language.
