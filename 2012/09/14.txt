[15:13:06] pukerat: How can i programmatically set the settings of the IE 9 browser that webdriver uses ?
[15:13:25] pukerat: it seems if i just open it manually and make my changes, they dont propagate to the browser webdriver uses
[15:13:31] rpereira_ has joined #selenium
[15:14:07] jimevans: pukerat: what kind of settings do you mean?
[15:14:47] jimevans: IE settings are pretty much global on the machine. they should be the same for all instances of IE on the machine (for the most part)
[15:15:14] pukerat: well
[15:15:19] pukerat: there are a few particular gross ones
[15:15:32] pukerat: one is that local intranet sites automatically open in compatibility view mode
[15:15:52] Dude-X: did you uncheck the setting in compatibility view settings?
[15:16:08] Dude-X: it's the first check box
[15:16:22] pukerat: yes, but once the IE 9 opens from webdriver, it uses its own setting it seems
[15:17:09] caseyjb: make sure you're using the same bitness IE driver server as the IE your changing settings in
[15:17:11] pukerat: also
[15:17:23] pukerat: oh crap casey...you are a smart fellow
[15:17:57] Dude-X: ah yeah. also prefer ie9 32-bit because the JS engine has a JIT. 64 bit doesn't
[15:17:59] caseyjb: if i could spell, you're*
[15:27:36] adamgoucher: sure. a month after i am home from vienna, i get the consulting inquiry.
[15:28:19] Dude-X: how is √ñestreicher
[15:28:26] detronizator: jimevans: it's internal to the page object
[15:28:31] detronizator: there is a call
[15:28:48] detronizator: "currentFrame()" on the internal "m_webPage" object to get the latest one
[15:30:13] funcman has joined #selenium
[15:32:37] jimevans: detronizator: does that frame retain focus when it's navigated? in other words, i click on an element in a frame, which causes a navigation of the frame. does currentFrame() still refer to the same frame? (i'm guessing there's a bug there, but i'm not sure)
[15:34:19] detronizator: mmm
[15:34:25] detronizator: only THAT frame is supposed to navigate?
[15:34:30] AutomatedTester: look at me... I am doing web development
[15:34:35] Dude-X: ooh
[15:34:39] pukerat: its not hte 32bit vs 64 bit issue
[15:34:40] detronizator: jimevans: 
[15:34:44] pukerat: they genuinely have differant settings
[15:34:52] jimevans: detronizator: yes.
[15:35:00] detronizator: jimevans: there might be a bug in there
[15:35:09] detronizator: I recall doing something I was not sure was a good idea
[15:35:14] detronizator: but the fix might be EASY
[15:35:18] detronizator: will have to check
[15:35:26] jimevans: detronizator: i think that's the cause of the frame bug in the failing frame test i sent a couple of weeks ago.
[15:35:32] detronizator: the issue: every time a navigation starts
[15:35:41] detronizator: there is an event to "navigate"
[15:35:54] detronizator: and the assumption (too strong, that's why I was unsure)
[15:36:03] detronizator: was that the page resets the frame to the mainframe
[15:36:12] detronizator: but that's not a good assumption, I know eveidently see
[15:36:17] detronizator: we need to stick with the current frame
[15:36:20] detronizator: no matter what
[15:36:34] detronizator: the problem is to differenciate between a total page reload
[15:36:41] detronizator: and a "partial" (only a frame) page reload
[15:36:54] detronizator: I'm glad you looked into it: I know have a much smaller scope to address
[15:37:05] detronizator: jimevans: btw, I'm sorry it's taking me so long to be on it :(
[15:37:21] detronizator: BUT you are spotting the real weaknesses of ghostdriver early on
[15:37:32] detronizator: and that is good: working alone wasn't the best 
[15:37:53] jimevans: detronizator: hey, i know you're busy. i'd like to help, but you're far more familiar with the architecture than i am, so it's much easier for me to point out the issues, with good reproduction, than to try to wade in and fix it myself.
[15:38:25] detronizator: that is the most valuable thing you can do
[15:38:39] detronizator: ultimately, this GhostDriver thingy is a "retrofitting"
[15:38:49] detronizator: it's making phantomjs behave like a "big boy browser"
[15:39:11] detronizator: and only if you are looking at it "from the outside" you can be spotting stuff easily, as you know what the other browsers do very well.
[15:39:12] jimevans: having a working language binding for it makes it much easier to spot the issues, because you can run the common webdriver tests against it. 
[15:39:19] detronizator: myself, I don't as much as you.
[15:39:35] detronizator: after 1.0
[15:39:39] detronizator: I want to pause
[15:39:48] detronizator: and port all the "official" tests
[15:39:57] detronizator: and have a 1.0.1 only with bug fixes

[16:48:35] dawagner: The dock seems not to be at all configurable.  I want a terminal shortcut, I don't want it at the bottom of the list.  This doesn't seem possible (or at least easy)
[16:48:45] dawagner: It took me a googling to work out how to open a terminal in the first place.
[16:49:44] dawagner: Now I'm trying to work out how to create a keyboard locale switcher shortcut (because my keyboard locale switches at random, and I need to switch it back), I haven't worked it out yet...
[16:50:02] jleyba: Which version of ubuntu did you upgrade to?
[16:50:22] dawagner: 12.04
[16:51:18] dawagner: Oh, and in their spelling ordering, "English (United Kingdom)" falls between "English (Denmark)" and "English (Hong Kong)", which is pretty special.
[16:52:00] jleyba: It's probably sorted by locale code and not UI label
[16:52:28] dawagner: Definitely a reasonable assumption :) Not a reasonable decision :(

[16:52:59] RossPatterson: That's almost as cool as MySQL defaulting to Swedish sorting!
[16:53:25] jleyba: Hmm... I know there's zh-hk for Chinese - Hong Kong.  So would the English equivalent be en-hk?
[16:53:38] dawagner: Very probably, and ours is en-gb

[18:33:07] Dude-X: time to log everything :)
[18:33:20] pukerat: the null exception is thrown in the webdriver code
[18:33:33] pukerat: im looking at the function, i can't find a single variable used in it that isn't checked if its null first
[18:33:47] pukerat: maybe the source im looking at is old
[18:36:51] pukerat: oh
[18:36:55] pukerat: i think i know what it is

[18:48:42] pukerat: im trying to run chrome on a node and its throwing a null exception
[18:48:45] pukerat: and i tracked it down 
[18:48:54] pukerat: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/dotnet/src/WebDriver/Remote/ErrorResponse.cs
[18:49:09] lukeis: wb jimevans ;) when are you flying in to SF?
[18:49:16] pukerat: in the constructor you are pulling out some objects out of a dictionary but not checking if they are null first
[18:49:35] pukerat: it appears what ever error im getting from the server, its setting this keys but with null values
[18:49:47] jimevans: lukies: i'll be there monday evening.
[18:50:09] pukerat: so basically i can't tell what the error is now
[18:50:23] jimevans: pukerat: great. so chromedriver is returning non-conformant json wire protocol responses again.
[18:50:25] dawagner: Aah fucknuggets.  I seem to be missing my root FS.
[18:50:40] lukeis: LOL dawagner today is not your day ;)
[18:50:53] pukerat: who wrote the chromedriver? 
[18:51:05] jimevans: the chromium team.
[18:51:05] lukeis: google ;)
[18:51:14] pukerat: you put null checks on every other variable used in that ctor
[18:51:27] pukerat: except the 3 dictionary values that are pulled
[18:51:37] jimevans: hang on. you're in the constructor for ErrorResponse.
[18:51:39] jimevans: right?
[18:51:41] pukerat: yes
[18:52:19] jimevans: so the only way you'd get that is if they sent a json response that had the property, but the property is a null value.
[18:52:25] jimevans: great.
[18:52:27] pukerat: one of those 3 .ToString() calls are likely causing null exception
[18:52:34] pukerat: yeah
[18:52:39] pukerat: thats what ive come to the conclusion of
[18:53:42] jimevans: what version of the chromedriver.exe are you using?
[18:54:03] pukerat: the one embedded in webdriver 2.25
[18:54:51] dawagner: Woo! I think I may just about have enough grub-fu to get myself booting again...
[18:54:53] jimevans: um. no. the .NET bindings don't embed a chromedriver.exe. you have to download it separately from http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list
[18:55:24] pukerat: err, why do you mean .net bindings
[18:55:27] pukerat: im connecting to a remote machine
[18:55:38] pukerat: you mean the jar doesn't contain the driver?
[18:55:43] jimevans: nope. never has.
[18:56:09] pukerat: interesting. ok so wouldn't that mean that webdriver is throwing an invalid json response when it can't find the chromedriver?
[18:56:40] jimevans: ever since the standalone executable chromedriver.exe was introduced, you've had to download it separately from the selenium .jars.
[18:56:47] jimevans: it could mean that.
[18:57:22] jimevans: let me try something.
[18:57:30] dawagner: Wait, where the fuck has /boot/grub/menu.lst gone!?
[18:59:03] jleyba: jimevans: What does the IEDriverServer do if I send a command to a deleted session?
[18:59:13] jleyba: e.g. driver.quit(); driver.getCurrentUrl();
[18:59:29] jimevans: jleyba: with the latest sources, it should no-op.
[18:59:48] jleyba: jimevans: and before it crashed?
[18:59:59] jimevans: yeah, if memory serves.

[19:00:17] pukerat: i copied chromedriver to the server... still getting the same error
[19:00:35] pukerat: its sitting right next to the iedriver
[19:00:54] jimevans: pukerat: you gotta give me a second.
[19:00:57] pukerat: ok
[19:02:23] dawagner: I'm only missing two partitions now!
[19:02:36] *dawagner will stop babbling about his disk woe
[19:03:31] jimevans: pukerat: i've just run a remote chrome session to the java server where the chromedriver.exe couldn't be located, and i've gotten the proper exception (not NullReferenceException)
[19:04:06] pukerat: ok hmm
[19:04:16] pukerat: well let me throw some parameters out there that might have caused it
[19:04:32] pukerat: the chrome installed is the 'standalone' installer for all users
[19:04:41] pukerat: i dont know if anyone has tested on that chrome
[19:05:22] jimevans: y'know, if you have visual studio, it'd be pretty easy to build your own .net bindings, and then you could debug the thing yourself. :)
[19:05:26] pukerat: second, the remote webdriver is running as a service on win7 so its on session 0 desktop... the service has interact with desktop enabled
[19:05:50] pukerat: ok i guess i'll debug it
[19:06:00] jimevans: pukerat: that's a red flag for me, running as a service.
[19:06:07] jimevans: i almost never recommend it
[19:06:12] pukerat: well it ran fine for IE9 and for firefox
[19:06:19] pukerat: why dont you recommend that?
[19:06:43] jimevans: because of the inherent differences between running as a user process and running as a service.
[19:07:36] pukerat: well when i had a smaller grid i used to just run on desktop sessions...but now i think i need something more dependable since i have way more nodes
[19:07:43] jimevans: if it works for you, great. if it breaks, it's one of th efirst things i'm going to suggest changing.
[19:08:03] pukerat: i understand
[19:09:03] pukerat: i remember last time i built this thing i had alot of problems
[19:09:16] jimevans: i don't mean to be flip about debugging it yourself, but i've done what i can to duplicate your environment, and i can't reproduce the issue. i'm loathe to make blind changes to the source without good reason, and honestly, it's the first time i've heard of this particular issue.
[19:09:33] pukerat: no i understand where you are coming from
[19:10:03] pukerat: it may be an odd error that it throws that you can't reproduce but regardless something is still throwing an error that isn't strictly correct
[19:10:13] pukerat: a non well formed error
[19:10:33] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[19:10:53] jimevans: well, no, i get a well-formed error that tells me (essentially), "hey, dumbass, you need the chromedriver.exe and i couldn't find it"
[19:11:07] pukerat: well like i said maybe its not that error
[19:11:17] pukerat: maybe its a more unique error to my situation
[19:11:24] jimevans: could be.
[19:11:34] pukerat: but i think the .net bindings should handle poorly formed errors in a more graceful way
[19:11:49] pukerat: since it sounds like you have had problems with the chromedriver throwing poorly formed errors before
[19:12:00] jimevans: not to that degree.
[19:12:37] jimevans: they'd throw a string instead of a proper error object, and we *do* handle that case properly.
[19:14:19] jimevans: plus, we should handle random ill-formed responses that deviate from the documented protocol in an undefined and unpredictable way? that's a huge solution space to have to cover.
[19:14:45] sassda: hey guys, how does the css selector engine works? I have an element that I can easily find manually using a css selector, but webdriver does not seem to find it
[19:15:17] jleyba: sassda: which browser?  webdriver delegates to the browser when possible
[19:15:20] jleyba: it uses sizzle for IE
[19:15:22] jimevans: anyway, a small piece of advice before building, remove the c++ projects before trying to build the C# code.
[19:16:14] jimevans: s/uses sizzle for IE/uses sizzle for IE versions that do not natively support CSS selectors/
[19:16:54] jimevans: brb
[19:19:50] *lukeis spells it out...  IE 6/7 use Sizzle.  IE 8/9/10 use native css support.  which means IE8 is the limiting factor
[19:20:12] sassda: jleyba chrome and ff
[19:20:48] lukeis: open chrome inspector or Firebug and try it out $$("your css")
[19:21:10] jleyba: lukeis: ewww, dirty jquery code
[19:21:55] lukeis: that's not jquery
[19:21:57] sassda: tried, it works
[19:22:01] jleyba: sassda: more importantly, try using the JavascriptExecutor - ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("return document.querySelector(arguments[0]);", yourCss)
[19:22:22] jleyba: If that returns non-null, congrats, you've found a WebDriver bug
[19:22:44] lukeis: jleyba: or do the inspectors automatically import them? (cause chrome on a page that doesn't have jquery allows it)
[19:23:26] sassda: yeah it returns the element I want
[19:23:34] jleyba: lukeis: Aww man, it looks like they added a native implementation for it
[19:24:07] jleyba: $$.toString() -> "function() { [native code] }"
[19:24:13] lukeis: :-D
[19:25:03] lukeis: same with $x  <- for xpath :)
[19:25:11] jleyba: sassda: Please file a bug with a (if possible) a reduced test case http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list
[19:25:23] sassda: sure
[19:25:38] jleyba: We've got tests that test css selectors, so the reduced test case part is important :)
[19:26:03] lukeis: sassda: before that.. one more question, is the thing you're trying to locate inside a frame or iframe?
[19:26:15] sassda: nope its not
[19:26:18] lukeis: ok :)
[19:26:44] lukeis: have a public page and the locator I could look at?
[19:26:51] sassda: actually I can show you, the project is public now
[19:27:09] sassda: but you need a yahoo account (yes, I work for yahoo ;) ) 
[19:27:45] sassda: logged in with a yahoo account, go to http://axis.yahoo.com/home
[19:28:38] lukeis: well, i've got one of those somewhere at least ;)

[19:30:32] jimevans: pukerat: sigh. that should never be. message is *required* by the goddamned spec.

[20:32:00] aivaturi has joined #selenium
[20:38:12] pukerat: so how can i open a browser that the test would use in order to setup the browser settings
[20:38:39] pukerat: i ran IE, clicked past all the welcome to IE 8 bs and changed compatibility view settings only to have the test open a browser where none of that stuff has changed

[20:50:21] AutomatedTester: pukerat: are your using the same bit version of IE as the one your downloaded?
[20:50:41] AutomatedTester: e.g. 32Bit IEDriverServer vs 64Bit IEDriverServer

[21:49:04] sassda: lukeis: sorry meetings after meetings :( so you tried on your mac and it worked?
[21:49:56] lukeis: yep
[21:50:02] jarib: barancev|2: so that seems to be javascript/firefox-driver/js/wdsession.js:181
[21:50:14] lukeis: well, with the same versions of chrome :-/
[21:51:09] jarib: barancev|2: catching the exception and then going into the branch on :184 would probably solve it, but would be nice to have a test for this...
[21:52:41] sassda: ok, thanks, I will try to dig deeper on my side, very weird
[21:53:10] jarib: barancev|2: not sure how up to date this is, but http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/js/xpconnect/idl/xpcIJSWeakReference.idl.html indicates it should return null, not throw
[21:53:15] jarib: so may actually be a bug
[21:55:06] barancev|2: a bug introduced in FF 14?
[21:56:06] barancev|2: are there mozilla's tests for this interface?
[21:56:34] barancev|2: would be interesting to check the result
[21:57:36] jarib: yeah, i don't know

[22:35:24] dawagner: jarib: Nope, my own side-project :)
[22:36:54] dawagner: Hey admc :)
[22:36:59] jarib: ok. as a workaround you could just install the browsers you need (if they run on linux)
[22:37:41] dawagner: Yeah, chrome and firefox are actually pre-installed on their VMs, but I'd quite like IE and some mobile browsers :)
[22:38:00] jarib: ah, they have chrome as well now? 
[22:38:07] dawagner: Yep!
[22:38:09] jarib: guess i can drop instalation from the watir-webdriver build then
[22:38:24] dawagner: I don't think it's written down anywhere that they do, but the latest chromedriver can start a chrome without me copying it there, so...
[22:38:59] jarib: so they have the chromedriver executable as well?
[22:39:05] dawagner: No, I copied in the chromedriver
[22:39:09] dawagner: But not chrome

[23:01:19] jarib: admc: so is there a way to do it right now, or in the pipeline?
[23:10:04] admc: jarib: not sure what you are referring to
[23:10:16] jarib: admc: travis + sauce
[23:10:57] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[23:10:58] admc: ah, so they are currently documenting a feature that allows you to define environment variables that you can use to store your username and api key, then use in your tests by reading them from process.env or whatever
[23:11:13] admc: infact ill email josh right now to get an update on it
[23:11:24] admc: id like to get a blog post out as soon as I can get it working right for my WD library
[23:11:38] dawagner: Woo! Does documenting imply the feature already works, and just isn't documented yet?
[23:11:40] admc: which currently runs sauce tests from travis, but I created a sub account just for the project and checked in my creds
[23:12:09] admc: dawagner: i was told that it was partially working, but I couldnt get it to do what I wanted
[23:12:24] dawagner: Do you use SauceConnect to expose the server, or is there a way of grabbing a public hostname/ip/... for the VM?
[23:13:08] admc: the WD tests are using a public web app to test against, but you could use some bash magic to launch sauce connect from the VM and pause for 30 seconds
[23:13:13] admc: before starting your test run
[23:13:25] admc: where is your web app existing?
[23:13:39] dawagner: In-memory, deployed in test setup
[23:13:49] admc: so its running locally on the travis box?
[23:13:51] dawagner: Yep
[23:14:14] admc: is that world accessible? when you you it, you don't get an IP of any kind?
[23:14:22] admc: I would probably launch sauce connect on the vm and then just hit localhost
[23:14:38] dawagner: Cool :)
[23:14:58] dawagner: I don't suppose sauceconnect does parallel tunnels yet, does it?

[23:16:49] admc: one instance per VM
[23:16:50] Dude-X: hey santiycr if i am a saucelabs customer, do you give customers advice on how to use the best cross browser selectors?
[23:17:36] admc: for selenium 1 we have sauce advisor which analyses your selectors and gives you advise, I don't think thats working for webdriver yet
[23:18:16] admc: but my best advise is simple CSS selectors
[23:18:26] admc: that don't have 10 degrees of chaining :)
[23:19:27] Dude-X: i am pretty good at making locators, but i don't have much experience getting things to work in IE‚Ä¶ right now i'm interviewing at a few companies looking to hire a selenium test engineer
[23:19:47] Dude-X: rather, i have never tried to get my test suite to run in IE in a serious manner
[23:20:08] admc: ah makes sense, well the tough part about that is that in the older IE versions the DOM is actually different, so you need to heavily rely on the classes if you can
[23:20:29] admc: selecting with tags and parents/children is going to break
[23:20:32] admc: and xpaths are impossible
[23:20:53] Siph0n: does anyone have problems using Chrome in jenkins (using xvfb for a framebuffer), and using the maximize function? My chrome tests wouldn't even start if I used the maximize functions.
[23:21:02] Dude-X: i'd figure that i should probably look into interchangable locators
[23:21:27] Dude-X: like "load IE-specific-locators if running on IE"
[23:21:36] Siph0n: and my jenkins is on an ubuntu 12.04 host
[23:21:43] admc: yeah that gets nasty though, you can write cross browser locators if your crafty
[23:22:15] admc: I usually start with what Selenium Builder generates, and then pair it down
[23:22:20] admc: because im lazy
[23:22:23] Dude-X: hmm you're right, it makes test maintenance a bit more challenging...
[23:23:00] Dude-X: at my company we have an outsource team that writes webdriver tests. They make me cry....
[23:23:42] admc: yeah that can be pretty painful.. because what you really need is people who understand the organization of the UI, which usually means being part from end developer
[23:23:45] admc: front
[23:24:10] Dude-X: well to a casual observer that's a programmer, our existing tests follow a nice pattern
[23:24:24] Dude-X: for some reason, they don't care to observe that pattern
[23:24:36] dawagner: admc: Has that changed? Because I remember it used to be one per account...
