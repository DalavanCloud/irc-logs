[13:15:47] cmcgraw has joined #selenium
[13:20:47] dawagner: jarib: I've filed a ticket to get the DNS entries for jenkins set up; which DNS did you want to add to that?
[13:21:02] dawagner: (Because yes, setting up DNS entries can't be done on a dashboard, it has to be done by ticket filing... Ugh...)
[13:21:34] jarib: :/
[13:22:17] dawagner: lukeis has got seleniumhq.org working on appengine, so we may want to just ditch our current domain provider and move to a new one where setting up DNS is easy...
[13:22:29] dawagner: Do you know if we have other services running on the box that runs bamboo?
[13:22:48] dawagner: davehunt: It looks like the bamboo machine is dying, want to try moving the IDE CI to jenkins?
[13:22:51] jarib: i don't know
[13:23:07] dawagner: Oh, and this afternoon I'm going to try to fix our CI builds and clean them up a bit, if anyone wants to help, feel free!
[13:23:43] jarib: for my stuff it's just the ignore + ci dashboard, which would be good to move off my domain
[13:24:07] dawagner: So, ignores.ci.seleniumhq.org and dashboard.ci.seleniumhq.org?
[13:24:09] davehunt: dawagner: sounds good.. do we have a machine to run the tests on though?
[13:24:20] dawagner: r17737

[13:24:28] dawagner: davehunt: What does the machine need to have on it?
[13:25:08] davehunt: dawagner: Python, and it needs to be able to run Firefox
[13:25:23] dawagner: How about we point them at your VPS for now, and when I have a GCE instance you can SSH to, we can flip them over?
[13:25:37] jarib: dawagner: ideally move those two off my server as well, if we have available machines (GCE?)
[13:25:44] jarib: oh
[13:25:46] jarib: right.
[13:25:48] dawagner: davehunt: Yep, we can do that; could you write me a shell script which will run the tests?
[13:25:50] davehunt: we might be able to switch to using the mozmill environment, which I think means less dependancies
[13:26:18] davehunt: dawagner: I should be able to do that
[13:26:21] dawagner: jarib: I can happily start them running on the GCE machine, but only googlers will be able to touch them until I get stuff public
[13:26:32] davehunt: Not sure how soon I can work on it though... :/
[13:26:37] dawagner: We can install whatever dependencies we need to, we just need to quantify them :)
[13:26:50] dawagner: Presumably the bamboo server has a list of shell commands it runs, right?
[13:26:51] jarib: that's fine, point them at my VPS until they're public
[13:27:11] dawagner: Cool :) Got an IP or a CNAME I can point to?
[13:27:41] jarib: 109.74.192.179

[13:33:17] dawagner: The website I think lukeis has a single maven command you run which just deploys

[14:47:06] dawagner: heh
[14:47:27] dawagner: I assume we don't actually need sauce for this, we can just run it locally on the CI machines, like HtmlUnit
[14:49:11] andreastt: There's so much wtf here.
[14:49:44] andreastt: EcmascriptDebugger_6_ requires ecmascript-debugger version 7.  Which doesn't even exist.
