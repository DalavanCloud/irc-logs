[00:50:04] flyinprogramer: so yah, does anyone know how to get the console log from firefox through selenium-webdriver?
[00:50:34] flyinprogramer: meaning, lets say my driver waits, and expires on waiting, and i want to get a capture of the javascript console.. is there away to do it ?
[00:51:55] adamgoucher: i seem to think there is a plugin for firefox which will dump it
[00:56:44] jarib: you can also configure a file for logging 
[00:56:50] jarib: flyinprogramer: what language are you working in?
[00:56:53] flyinprogramer: ruby

[01:05:08] jarib: flyinprogramer: not quite what i expected, but this does produce a bunch of log files: https://gist.github.com/3725732
[01:05:29] jarib: flyinprogramer: unfortunately the thrown exception doesn't appear to be part of any of them..
[01:06:24] jarib: so then adamgoucher's suggestion is likely your best bet: https://github.com/mguillem/JSErrorCollector
[01:07:03] flyinprogramer: alright, thanks!
[01:07:11] stephend: cool
[01:07:17] stephend: we've wanted something like that for our team too

[01:25:00] loves_color_text: hi guys how can i get selenium to use firefox with --display=:0 (to get it to launch properly when called remotely with ssh).. trying to find what to edit....
[01:27:35] loves_color_text: ok cool looks like i managed it by adding "args << '--display=:0'" in def start_with right before execute is called. thanks
[01:29:51] jarib: loves_color_text: if this is on a local machine, you can also just set ENV['DISPLAY'] = ":0" before your code starts firefox
[01:30:52] jarib: (i.e. if the test and the browser runs on the same machine)
[01:32:10] loves_color_text: jarib: it's actually not a test... ive begun using selenium webdriver to automate stupid stuff like complex VPN logins and such which require browser interaction
[01:32:36] loves_color_text: i ended up opening up the execute function in my own code and rewriting it -- i'll try your method and see if it works
[01:32:47] jarib: well, s/test/webdriver code/
[01:33:51] brettporter has joined #selenium
[01:34:15] loves_color_text: jarib: that worked great! thanks!
[01:34:31] jarib: np
[01:34:31] loves_color_text: useful little trick :]

[02:04:34] santiycr: Dude-X:  if you stick to basic css rules, you shouldn't have compat issues 
[02:05:09] santiycr: all browsers will support rules like a.myClas b#myId c[attr=myAttr]
[02:05:51] santiycr: I don't think I've ever been bit by incompatible locators when it comes to running on multiple browsers
[02:07:16] santiycr: the only think I keep in mind is that older IE (6 and 7, IIRC) use Sizzle, which does have some goodies (I'd avoid using them) and changes some syntax, like replacing "nth-child" with just "nth"
