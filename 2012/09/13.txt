[09:32:44] mira|AO: morning
[09:32:52] mira|AO: I hope it's ok to ask here... following situation:
[09:35:05] mira|AO: there's this selenium testsuite in php (using phpunit_selenium), and we'd like to adopt it to a changed webapp; most tests fail now due to theming changes (usually, only little things have to be changed), but it's really time-consuming to try and reproduce everything manually in a browser, so I'd like to specify an option so that, when e.g. a $this->assertTrue() fails, the test immediately stops BUT THE BROWSER IS NOT CLOSED, so that w
[09:35:05] mira|AO: connect to the browser using VNC (already works) and look manually (if must, with firebug) whether to change the test or fix the application
[09:35:34] mira|AO: when running the tests, I see the browser window in VNC and lots of things going on, but there's not really a chance to interact/stop it
[09:35:49] mira|AO: and when closing selenium, the browser is quit, too, so that's not an option either…

[09:40:09] andreastt: mira|AO: There are ways around that for some implementations.  Both Opera and Chrome supports detaching the browser process.

[10:21:58] mira|AO: ok, this works
[10:23:01] mira|AO: it's basically:

[10:23:06] mira|AO:         protected function onNotSuccessfulTest(Exception $e) {

[10:23:06] mira|AO:                 $SeleniumGforge_die = 1;
[10:23:06] mira|AO:                 exit();
[10:23:07] mira|AO:         }
[10:23:07] mira|AO:         public function __destruct() {

[10:23:09] mira|AO:                 }
[10:23:33] mira|AO: the double exit() prevents the parent::__destruct (and all others) from running, thus keeping the selenium server and browser open

[14:20:40] simonstewart: "Bring the iframe into focus"?
[14:21:20] RossPatterson: simonstewart: Check that link I sent jim.
[14:21:43] adamgoucher: simonstewart <shrug> i was tired. the double clicks were not executing. thought it was it wasnt viewable
[14:21:55] simonstewart: adamgoucher: this makes no sense
[14:22:04] simonstewart: Ahhh
[14:22:07] simonstewart: right
[14:22:11] simonstewart: so, the correct way to do this:
[14:22:15] simonstewart: 1) switch to the iframe
[14:22:28] simonstewart: Find the div
[14:22:46] simonstewart: And then "do something with it"

[16:25:24] jimevans: simonstewart: not a bad break, just a test failure. i'll investigate. you tend to firefox.
[16:26:01] pukerat: so are you saying it wont behave correctly unless i use an ID that matches the nodes hostname?
[16:27:39] davehunt: pukerat: I'm not entirely sure. I want to use it as an unaddressable identifier. In our case, the nodes can't be addressed by hostname
[16:27:55] davehunt: but using hostname will mean that we known what nodes they are

[17:09:56] chogan: getting this error somewhat sporadically (se 2.35 and FF 15)
[17:09:57] chogan: Selenium::WebDriver::Error::UnknownError: Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [xpcIJSWeakReference.get]
[17:10:07] chogan: anyone have any insight into it?
[17:11:57] Dude-X: rmcauley: i'm saying you  simply can't click on a dropdown, and then have it click on a dropdown (where you wait for the element to be found where it's not throwing errors)
[17:12:00] Dude-X: that doesn't work
[17:12:15] rmcauley: the dropdown's <option>s exist
[17:12:34] rmcauley: otherwise I wouldn't be able to click on them.  the page fully loads and is ready.
[17:13:02] Dude-X: yes but it's a JS dropdown. when you click on the dropdown it's executing javascript that's manipultating the dom

[17:15:28] rmcauley: (or it's a problem in my abstraction, one or the other will happen)
[17:15:29] jarib: chogan: i was hoping for a stacktrace from the JS side of things, can you reproduce it without the remote server in between (though it really should report the same thing)?
[17:17:22] chogan: jarib: unfortunately, I only see this error when running tests on the nodes. let me dig around the nodes to try and find the original stack trace

[18:59:49] detronizator: adamgoucher: "make work project"?
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Sep 13 19:00:01 2012]
[19:00:01] adamgoucher: yup. make it work :)
[19:00:15] jimevans: that's kind of up to us, but ghostdriver uses the json wire protocol directly
[19:00:45] jimevans: a RemoteWebDriver instance will talk to it just fine.
[19:00:49] jab416171|Cloud has joined #selenium
[19:01:00] lawcab has left #selenium
[19:01:36] adamgoucher: ah. so if i wanted say firefox i talk to the se server, but if i wanted ghostdriver i talk to something else? or would it be like chromedriver where the server talks to something else which actually launches stuff
[19:01:42] jimevans: it's pretty slick, and detronizator's done a bang-up job bringing it along.
[19:01:55] *adamgoucher has given up on doing paid stuff this afternoon
[19:02:17] jimevans: okay, quick definition.
[19:02:34] jimevans: phantomjs is the browser executable (phantomjs.exe on windows).
[19:02:49] jimevans: ghostdriver is a javascript library that you can load into phantomjs.
[19:03:04] *adamgoucher is amused that jim is correcting him on terminology :)
[19:03:15] jimevans: like so: ./phantomjs /my/path/to/ghostdriver/main.js
[19:03:51] jimevans: well, most people don't talk about phantomjs, but talk about ghostdriver as if they're one and the same, but they're not (not yet).
[19:03:56] detronizator: jimevans: adamgoucher: after I'm finished, will be "phantomjs --webdriver-mode"
[19:04:07] detronizator: the JS will be embedded in the Executable
[19:04:24] detronizator: but we decided to do the development outside, to not entangle PhantomJS development just yet
[19:04:44] jimevans: so if you launch phantomjs that way, you'll get a json wire protocol server listening on port 8080 (by default, yes it's configurable)
[19:05:03] detronizator: adamgoucher: yea, it is sort of "make it work": phantomjs was designed with a way NARROWER scope than a browser
[19:05:17] detronizator: so I'm making up functionalities in PhantomJS along the typing of the actual driver
[19:05:24] detronizator: like the cookies, just now
[19:05:26] adamgoucher: ah. so its more comparable the android implementation than firefox (from a bindings maintainer perspective)
[19:05:26] detronizator: frame support
[19:05:33] detronizator: multiple window support
[19:05:37] jimevans: so just like you'd talk to the remote java server, you can talk to the ghostdriver instance just like a java remote server.
[19:05:39] detronizator: and so on: all stuff that was not available
[19:06:02] detronizator: I think it's like having ChromeDriver into the Chrome executable
[19:06:21] jimevans: detronizator: good way to put it.
[19:06:27] jimevans: or it's like marionette will be.
[19:07:19] adamgoucher: from a remote perspective, chrome is php -> se server -> chromedriver -> browser. this sounds like it is php -> phantomjs -> 'browser'
[19:07:23] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[19:07:46] adamgoucher: android is however php -> androiddriver -> browser
[19:08:06] jimevans: yeah, that's pretty close to accurate.
[19:09:52] jimevans: these pull requests i'm sending ivan are pulled directly from the webdriver integration test suite. we (or i anyway) want to hit the ground running having as close to compliant as possible when ghostdriver 1.0 is ready.
[19:09:54] detronizator: jimevans: thanks for the pull req btw
[19:10:06] jimevans: np
[19:10:23] detronizator: u want to know why is this cookiejar giving me so much trouble?
[19:10:33] detronizator: because the cookiejar provided by QtWebKit is pretty... shit
[19:10:49] detronizator: it doesn't seem to apply almost any filtering logic, but just a tiny bit of it
[19:10:50] adamgoucher: yup. i have a scheme for using it as soon as its available w/ saunter
[19:10:58] detronizator: and it doesn't offer a proper CRUD interface
[19:11:06] jimevans: i feel for you.

[19:12:22] detronizator: but I'm sure now I know where to look: initially, with the old CookieJar, was a mess
[19:12:25] jimevans: well, at least you have a solid repro case. :)

[19:48:14] AutomatedTester: jleyba__: ok, render is quite ambiguous
[19:49:05] AutomatedTester: jleyba__: it still needs to do the draws but it stays in memory because that is part of the parsing code

[19:50:55] AutomatedTester: jleyba__: did you shed  a tear today?

[19:51:31] jimevans: i know the arguments for and against headless browsers. i'm of the mindset that there's a place for that tool in your kit, and if you're going to use one, it might as well be as close to a "real" browser as possible, and might as well support webdriver out of the gate.
[19:51:40] jleyba__: AutomatedTester: You mean over a certain person leaving the collective and suddenly finding my TODO list several orders of magnitude longer?  Maybe.

[20:51:25] zmorris: in the process of researching, but if anyone has a quick answer, would be appreciated.... trying to hover on menu, which causes drop-down to appear, then click drop-down item... I can get the mouse-over to work, but how do I click the option I want? Do I need to continue using the Actions builder?
[20:52:33] zmorris: WebElement dropDown = driver.findElement(By.linkText("dropDownLinkText"));
[20:52:33] zmorris: 		Actions actionsBuilder = new Actions(driver);
[20:52:33] zmorris: 		Actions hover = actionsBuilder.moveToElement(dropDown);

[20:52:33] zmorris: 		WebElement myDropDownItem = driver.findElement(By.linkText("myDropDownItemText"));
[20:52:34] zmorris: 		actionsBuilder.moveToElement(myDropDownItem).click();

[21:06:41] zmorris: anyone? hover and click...
[21:09:27] lukeis: zmorris: you should be able to just click on the dropDownItem
[21:10:05] zmorris: without hovering?
[21:11:57] zmorris: hmm, I thought that is what I tried the first time... it worked.... gremlins... :)
[21:15:16] detronizator has joined #selenium
[21:16:24] zmorris: I wasn't able to directly click the link using RemoteWebDriver and IE7... thanks for the suggestion though lukeis.
[21:16:41] lukeis: ah, sorry, i meant with hovering
[21:16:57] pukerat: man
[21:17:13] lukeis: Actions().moveToElement(...).perform();  driver.findElement(By.(...)).click();
[21:17:14] pukerat: if i try to supply an ID to webdriver, it spam registers itself
[21:17:24] pukerat: and then wont accept any tests
[21:17:43] pukerat: meanwhile the hub spams that it was previously registered 
[21:17:54] alkemist: the value of getAttribute() wrt “boolean” attributes changed recently…
[21:18:02] alkemist: Does anyone know which version?
[21:18:03] zmorris: that is what I tried to do, it works fine locally with FirefoxDriver, but I need tests to pass in IE7 and it did not work there
[21:18:19] alkemist: This issue: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1497
[21:19:36] zmorris: do I need to hover over the same element I am clicking? bc I just hovered over the top element, which causes the dropdown, and then clicked a different element
[21:20:31] lukeis: zmorris: why not try chaining the entire action together?   Actions().moveToElement(dropDown).moveToElement(dropDownItem).click().perform()
[21:21:05] zmorris: ok.. I tried something similar to that, but don't think it was quite right. One second.
[21:21:20] zmorris: also, how did you direct the message to me like that?
[21:21:27] lukeis: if the first moveToElement doesn't cause the drop down to appear, try  .clickAndHold(dropDown) instead
[21:21:33] lukeis: zmorris: i just said your name ;)
[21:22:01] lukeis: (i typed it... well.. autocompleted after pressing z tab zmorris )
[21:22:29] zmorris: ah, got it.
[21:23:43] pukerat: does anyone know anything about passing ID to a grid node ?
[21:25:11] lukeis: pukerat: I don't know if that was thought through / implemented correctly... simon added that, but probably didn't pay attention to affects on the grid
[21:25:31] pukerat: yeah, im just wondering what i should do about it right now
[21:25:50] pukerat: i was going to use it to ident my vms, i thought it was working since they were registered with the hub
[21:25:53] pukerat: so i did it to all my vms
[21:25:54] zmorris: what do you mean passing ID to a grid node?
[21:26:14] zmorris: I'm using Grid too
[21:26:19] pukerat: now i realize the hub was constantly reregistering the nodes and dropping them... so i guess revert it?
[21:28:46] lukeis: zmorris: you can pass in the Session ID of a WebDriver instance to the constructor of your WebDriver instance... http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/announcing-selenium-2-19-the-prancing-unicorn-release/
[21:29:20] zmorris: oh ok, I don't think I am quite there yet.
[21:30:02] lukeis: alkemist: I'm not sure about 'recent' changes... if you can identify two versions of selenium I may be able to run it down... otherwise, the code is here: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/atoms/dom.js :-D
[21:31:26] alkemist: Doesn't really matter actually. I'll have to cater for both.
[21:31:44] alkemist: I develop a library that sits on top of WebDriver, so has to work with different versions.
[21:31:56] lukeis: what behavior are you seeing?
[21:32:27] *lukeis seems to remember something around that a while ago... would guess around 2.15 or so...
[21:33:30] alkemist: getAttribute() used to return "false" for “boolean” attributes that were not “true”. Now it's null.
[21:34:02] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[21:34:26] hourback has joined #selenium
[21:35:52] alkemist: I'll just copy the list of “boolean” attributes and translate if I get a "false" value back.

[21:46:05] AutomatedTester: I am going for a 32GB version I mean
[21:47:05] davehunt: lukeis: you have a 4 running iOS 5? mine is deathly slow these days
[21:47:07] lukeis: i still have wiggle room... just can't load a bunch of videos or anything big like that
[21:47:16] lukeis: yes, i do
[21:47:22] lukeis: i wouldn't say mine is slow
[21:47:25] davehunt: I'll be upgrading tomorrow
[21:47:31] lukeis: and it's a 4 not 4s (so, no siri)

[21:49:15] barancev: do we have an official selenium project archetype for maven?

[23:01:53] bags_: jleyba__: so u can explain to me a bit about selenium sockets binds? :)
[23:02:26] jleyba__: bags_: where?
[23:02:47] bags_: im using firefox, but want multiple launchs simultanely
[23:02:59] bags_: using only default port some browsers fail
[23:03:41] bags_: i've managed to set manually port number but other errors still occur, like failed to connect to host or binary
[23:03:50] bags_: using ports 7000-8000 atm
[23:03:52] bags_: any advice
[23:06:40] jarib: bags_: if you're managing ports manually, try to make sure those ports are outside the ephemeral port range
[23:07:15] hourback has joined #selenium
[23:08:27] bags_: yes they are
[23:09:01] jarib: what did you set the range to?
[23:09:02] bags_: could it be just system overload?
[23:09:09] bags_: 7000-8000
[23:09:18] bags_: using ubuntu server, so its the default
[23:09:23] bags_: 32768   61000
[23:10:47] jarib: try moving the browser ports to 1024-1124 and use 1125-61000 for ephemeral sockets
[23:11:15] bags_: ok will try that
[23:11:16] jarib: see if it changes your failure rate
[23:11:35] bags_: in other matter, is it possible to bind an already running firefox?
[23:14:13] AutomatedTester: oh hai jarib
[23:14:34] jarib: hi 
[23:14:50] AutomatedTester: how was javazone?

[23:18:10] jarib: or something :)
[23:18:26] jleyba__: assuming you started it with the WebDriver extension installed and know what port it's server is listening on
[23:19:47] jarib: AutomatedTester: maven also decided to switch to git, he said he'll try to move both projects at the same time :)
