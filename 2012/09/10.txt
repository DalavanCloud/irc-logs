[16:27:22] davehunt: 2.26 will likely support 10, 14, 15
[16:27:33] davehunt: that's native event support at least
[16:27:59] adamgoucher: so 'if (!bot.userAgent.isProductVersion('3.5')) {' is likely not needed in firefoxWeb'driver.js
[16:28:23] Dude-X: but 3.6 is supported

[17:48:31] dawagner: barancev: How does it affect us?

[17:49:07] barancev: dawagner: it can affect users
[17:49:29] adamgoucher: jimevans: right. ive seen that before. meaning ms' implementation -- as in 'these are the exceptions that could be thrown from it'
[17:49:51] jimevans: the ie driver doesn't use the atoms for css selectors or for xpath.
[17:50:12] barancev: as a solution, we can add to release notes a warning about this change
[17:51:16] barancev: a user that used to use commons-lang v2 API will have to include additional dependency to their projects

[19:35:16] adamgoucher: jarib: thats what i thought .. but then i started getting weird stuff like ELEMENT_ILLEGAL_STATE and such which through me down this rabbit hole to see if it was something in the browser's implementation of querySelector
[19:35:56] jarib: :wiki scalingwebdriver
[19:35:58] selbot2: 1: 03ScalingWebDriver: Describes issues that have to be handled when running concurrent Se2 - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ScalingWebDriver
[19:36:09] jarib: bags_: ^ that has a few tips
[19:36:24] bags_: tks i will read it
[19:37:38] jarib: bags_: start by extending the ephemeral port range, though you'll likely hit issues with firefox' socket lock. you'll notice there's a TODO on that page to describe how to deal with this.
[19:37:48] jarib: bags_: what language are using?
[19:37:54] bags_: jarib: java
[19:39:20] jarib: :gist us the errors you're seeing
[19:39:20] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[19:41:09] bags_: https://gist.github.com/3692962
[19:41:28] jarib: right
[19:41:30] Dude-X: ah the infamous socket lock error
[19:42:05] jarib: bags_: basically you can reduce the number of firefox instances running on this machine, or manage the ports yourself
[19:42:52] lukeis: or just start using a grid? ;)
[19:43:07] bags_: instances runing are not problem, only multiple launchs at same time. I have a pool but i didn't want to wait for full load of firefox
[19:43:18] bags_: firefox takes like 10sec
[19:43:19] bags_: to launch
[19:43:19] jarib: lukeis: that's the same as reducing the number on this machine :)
[19:43:31] lukeis: true...
[19:44:20] bags_: is there a way i use different ports and will that result?
[19:44:30] bags_: instead always the same binding port
[19:44:55] Dude-X: last time i looked at the source code, it seems you can't use different port numbers….
[19:45:04] adamgoucher: in theory, http://pastebin.com/jHGxfici should be sufficient for my rabbit hole extrication, but its not...
[19:45:34] jarib: bags_: we're using that port as a lock for a reason; you don't want multiple instances of firefox binding to the same port (for the server)
[19:46:46] jarib: however, you could do the port management as part of your pooling (and then override FirefoxDriver.obtainLock to return a "fake" Lock implementation)
[19:49:16] bags_: but is it possible to bind other ports? or i can just "fake" it
[19:49:22] bags_: so no errors occur
[19:49:49] jarib: you can't fake it 
[19:50:35] jarib: tbh, you need to understand some of the internals if you want to scale (beyond the point where you hit this issue) on a single machine.
[19:51:29] jarib: bags_: each firefox instance is a server, each one needs a separate port
[19:52:10] bags_: yes but error occurs all in same port, regardless number of instances running, so u telling me everyone binds at same port, but locks during binding
[19:52:12] bags_: therefore
[19:52:19] bags_: some will not get bindde
[19:52:37] jarib: 7054 is used for the lock
[19:53:02] bags_: can't i just remove the lock?
[19:53:41] jarib: it's there for a reason
[19:53:59] jarib: you can remove it if you manage the ports yourself
[19:54:15] bags_: hmm ok i still have to read more about it
[19:54:20] bags_: but thanks for the pathway
[19:54:35] jarib: yeah, unfortunately it's not really explained in detail anywhere
[19:54:50] bags_: guess i will have to "read" the source files
[19:54:52] jarib: i should write up somewhere how we're doing it
[19:55:03] Swadq has joined #selenium
[19:55:08] jarib: how many instances are running when you start seeing failures?
[19:55:38] bags_: i think it doesnt matter the number. i can have 50+ if i pool good and wait for firefox full load
[19:55:46] bags_: but if i lauchn 2 at same time
[19:55:55] bags_: most times 1 doesnt bind
[19:55:58] jarib: right

[20:05:35] jarib: in other news, the ci dashboard got an overhaul yesterday
[20:05:39] Swadq: bags_: Could you repeat your initial issue? I think I have the exact same problem
[20:05:41] jarib: including a nice graph http://dashboard.ci.seleniumhq.org/#/graphs
[20:06:46] Swadq: jarib: Are you responsible for that?
[20:06:57] jarib: the dashboard? yes
[20:07:00] Swadq: I suppose so, since you're Jari Bakken I imagine
[20:07:03] Swadq: Yeha
[20:07:14] Swadq: Might be nice to fix singular/plurals - "1 builds"
[20:07:24] bags_: Swadq: its multiple firefoxdrivers launchs resulting in failure to bind socket
[20:07:31] jarib: Swadq: where?
[20:07:47] jarib: oh, the graph
[20:07:49] Swadq: Hover over the "failure" plots on the graph
[20:08:04] Swadq: bags_: I think I do have the same issue - let me know if you find a solution would you?
[20:08:23] bags_: i will study the java sources
[20:08:28] bags_: and "play" around

[21:30:33] aivaturi has joined #selenium
[21:32:22] Guest34049: any thoughts
[21:32:42] aivaturi: Hi, is anyone aware if ghosdriver (phantomjs) is going to be supported in language bindings?
[21:33:41] jimevans: aivaturi: too early to say. i'm taking a keen interest in the project (contributed to it), and there will be a .NET binding for sure. will it be shipped alongside the rest of the webdriver bindings (IE, Firefox, Chrome, etc.)? not sure.
[21:34:38] lukeis: you should always be able to just use RemoteWD with it, even if the bindings don't have local versions that start the ghostdriver
[21:34:53] jimevans: that much is very true.
[21:36:03] aivaturi: So I must be doing something wrong then. I tried using python remoteWD to connect to ghostdriver server & the server kept complaining that it couldn't parse JSON 
[21:36:15] aivaturi: I thought may be ghostdriver didn't implement remote
[21:36:45] jimevans: aivaturi: you're going to have to go through some real hoops to get it to work with the code in the current state that it's in.
[21:37:04] jimevans: it won't work at all with the currently-released version of phantomjs (1.6)
[21:37:37] lukeis: what release does it work with?
[21:37:42] aivaturi: I'm trying the dev version that is listed on the github page, which you have to compile yourself.
[21:38:07] jimevans: lukeis: 1.7 (due in a few weeks) should have most of the hooks merged in.
[21:38:21] lukeis: cool :)
[21:38:37] lukeis: btw jimevans thanks for your work on that ;)
[21:38:53] lukeis: oh, and are you coming to dreamforce?
[21:39:05] jimevans: you're welcome, and yes, i am. :)
[21:39:18] lukeis: cool, see ya next week :)
[21:40:02] jimevans: aivaturi: what's the error you're getting in the phantomjs console? (use :gist to post the output)
[21:40:03] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[21:40:42] jimevans: lukeis: hey, aren't you supposed to be at the masonic auditorium by now?
[21:40:54] aivaturi: https://gist.github.com/3693786
[21:41:25] lukeis: jimevans: yeah... *should* except I work on the dreamforce team and we are still frantically working on it :) (you know, the thing they are talking about at masonic)
[21:41:58] jimevans: aivaturi: it's also possible that the python bindings are throwing a json object at the server in a format that it's not expecting.
[21:42:19] jimevans: lukeis: well, i'm supposed to be logged into the presentation too, but i have to go pick up the kids in a few minutes.
[21:42:31] Guest34049: is there any one helping me out ?
[21:42:59] jimevans: aivaturi: i have a working prototype of a phantomjs driver for .NET, working with the existing webdriver common tests.
[21:43:03] Dude-X: Guest34049:  i asked for details,you give me no useful info
[21:43:06] jimevans: so i know it's possible.
[21:43:32] Guest34049: hey I told its Firefox browser that is what you have asked for
[21:43:34] aivaturi: jimevans: I had it working with Perl as well, but Python just craps out on me
[21:43:43] Guest34049: and given the code that I am using too
[21:44:01] jimevans: and the ghostdriver tests are written using an instance of the java remotewebdriver.
[21:44:14] Dude-X: Ross i don't see a pastebin in the scrollback
[21:44:34] aivaturi: jimevans: thanks, I'll dig in to this further & see what is going on in Python
[21:45:31] jimevans: your best bet would be to stick a console.log right where it's trying to parse the json string, and see if you can figure out why it'd be crapping out.
[21:45:54] aivaturi: ok
[21:46:04] Guest34049: ahh ok just a moment
[21:46:27] jimevans: that'd be in request_handlers/session_request_handler.js around line 428
[21:47:57] jimevans: aivaturi: looking at that file, it looks like it's failing when you're trying to navigate to a url.
[21:48:08] aivaturi: probably 
[21:48:25] jimevans: so there's a line that reads:
[21:48:39] jimevans: var postObj = JSON.parse(req.post);
[21:48:53] jimevans: err, comma at the end, not semicolon
[21:49:06] jimevans: just before that line, throw in a console.log(req.post);
[21:49:19] jimevans: see what the raw json being sent to the driver is.
