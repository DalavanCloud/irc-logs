[12:06:08] simonstewart: davehunt: rounded corners?
[12:06:22] davehunt: simonstewart: context? :)
[12:06:38] simonstewart: Grid and its console
[12:06:43] davehunt: oh
[12:07:12] davehunt: I'm just interested in a more useful console. Rounded corners does not concern me particularly.
[12:07:19] simonstewart: I see the conversation has kicked off on the mailing list
[12:07:33] davehunt: But we'll soon have our custom proxy, so will have our own console too
[12:08:12] simonstewart: Heh. Seems to be a common pattern
[12:08:29] davehunt: Yeah, freynaud pointed me to the discussion
[12:08:55] davehunt: more icons! ;)
[12:09:11] simonstewart: Shiny!
[12:09:36] davehunt: We have more important things than the console to work on at the moment, but maybe when work is slow I'll play with the console a bit
[12:09:57] davehunt: I did mock something up earlier this year, but already think it's the wrong approach
[12:11:54] davehunt: simonstewart: I understood that CSS :contains was not supported, am I thinking of something else? Is it supported as long as the target browser supports CSS3?
[12:12:17] simonstewart: :contains is a jquery-ism
[12:12:48] simonstewart: It's supported so long as you do your search using jquery, which means going through the javascript executor
[12:12:57] davehunt: you can tell I haven't written any test code in a while :)
[12:13:26] davehunt: it's mentioned in the CSS3 spec though
[12:13:52] simonstewart: Interesting
[12:14:08] simonstewart: We delegate the CSS searches down to "querySelectorAll" and its ilk
[12:14:16] simonstewart: If that supports the feature, you're fine

[12:22:33] dekroning: simonstewart: starting to discover and love more and more about selenium :-)
[12:22:41] simonstewart: :) Thanks
[12:22:49] simonstewart: Ha! I see that barancev read my email
[12:23:09] dekroning: simonstewart: just starting to grasp these Page Object patterns, there seem to be a nice ruby gem for it, which i'm studying now called site_prism
[12:23:20] barancev: simonstewart: yes, and you know -- these tests were using testng!
[12:23:33] simonstewart: I've heard of it. I'm still old skool enough to write my page objects by hand
[12:23:34] barancev: they are outdated in all senses
[12:23:39] simonstewart: barancev: Noooooo!
[12:24:06] dekroning: simonstewart: by hand was also something i'm thining about since, it's lets "magic" :-) so I might feel a bit more incontrol
[12:24:26] simonstewart: That's why I do it. 
[12:24:46] dekroning: simonstewart: do you guys also interact with protocolbuffers when testing with selenium
[12:24:56] simonstewart: Which is ironic, since I wrote both the PageFactory and the Augmenter 
[12:24:58] dekroning: or can the perhaps play together someway ?
[12:25:04] simonstewart: Json over Http
[12:25:10] simonstewart: :wiki jsonwireprotocol
[12:25:11] selbot2_: 1: 03JsonWireProtocol: A description of the protocol used by WebDriver to communicate with remote instances - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol
[12:25:18] alkemist: Would it be possible to give some diagnostics on what the element in question is on ‚ÄúElement not found in the cache‚Äù errors?
[12:26:36] simonstewart: It means that the element you previously found is no longer on the page
[12:26:50] simonstewart: There might be something identical there, but it's not the same element as before
[12:26:51] dekroning: simonstewart: also I was wondering about google's BITE project, if it's somehow related?
[12:26:56] alkemist: Sorry, let me reprhase‚Ä¶
[12:27:13] simonstewart: dekroning: not really :)
[12:27:19] alkemist: In the exception that is thrown, would it be possible to give some specifics on what the element in question is? e.g. tag name
[12:28:31] simonstewart: That was something that James Whittaker in particular was pushing. He's since moved on from Google
[12:28:33] barancev: I've found more tests that either use testng or junit3
[12:28:41] simonstewart: alkemist: which language are you using?
[12:28:47] alkemist: Java.
[12:28:47] dekroning: simonstewart: so it's more or less not really active anymore?
[12:28:51] simonstewart: barancev: there are some tests that we should be running that we're not
[12:28:58] simonstewart: dekroning: as I understand it
[12:29:13] simonstewart: alkemist: the toString of the element will give you the chain of locators used to find it
[12:29:20] simonstewart: (in recent selenium releases)
[12:29:33] simonstewart: Which should allow you to figure out what you used to be dealing with
[12:29:35] alkemist: That doesn't really help me, as this can be deep in my stack
[12:29:53] alkemist: This is the exception I see: Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.remote.ErrorHandler$UnknownServerException: Element not found in the cache - perhaps the page has changed since it was looked up
[12:30:10] alkemist: Could the toString() of the element be in that message?
[12:30:52] dekroning: simonstewart: i bought that book about google testing lately, have yet to get started on that one though :-) I was wondering if nooglers also needed to read it :)
[12:31:14] simonstewart: Hmm‚Ä¶ that's an unknown server error: we don't know you've got an element there.
[12:31:24] simonstewart: alkemist: a reproducible test case would help
[12:31:35] simonstewart: dekroning: nooglers don't read it
[12:32:05] alkemist: This isn't a selenium bug. It's expected behaviour. What I'm interested in is if the error message can be improved to make it easier to diagnose.
[12:32:26] dekroning: simonstewart: hehe :-) 
[12:32:38] simonstewart: alkemist: is there a reproducible test case you can share? That'd help
[12:32:40] dekroning: simonstewart: so how do they learn the process?

[12:33:12] simonstewart: dekroning: there's "noogler training" when you join the company
[12:33:19] simonstewart: where you get introduced to a bunch of ideas and stuff
[12:33:25] simonstewart: And then you land in a team
[12:33:25] dekroning: simonstewart: ah right
[12:33:42] dekroning: simonstewart: so Ruby isn't really much used around there right?
[12:33:47] simonstewart: It's unusual these days to land in a team on your own
[12:33:53] simonstewart: Java, Python, JS and C++
[12:34:01] alkemist: simonstewart: I'm not sure what a test case would prove‚Ä¶ isn't this exactly the expected behaviour when you try and query through a detached DOM element?
[12:34:14] alkemist: Or are you surprised at that particular exception?
[12:34:25] simonstewart: alkemist: the next step will be to file a :newissue so we don't forget
[12:34:26] selbot2_: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/entry
[12:34:29] dekroning: simonstewart: btw, is there some code available online, where you use your page objects? to get some inspiration perhaps
[12:34:43] simonstewart: I'm about to head off for lunch with my wife, and when I come back it's family time
[12:34:53] dekroning: simonstewart: have a great day!
[12:35:00] simonstewart: The wiki has some examples
[12:35:06] dekroning: up to date ?
[12:35:12] simonstewart: dekroning: yup. It's good to be unemployed sometimes
[12:35:20] simonstewart: dekroning: they'll give you the flavour
[12:35:33] dekroning: simonstewart: :-) so you no longer work there?
[12:35:41] simonstewart: I left a week ago

[12:35:54] dekroning: ow wow that's fresh
[12:36:20] simonstewart: And exciting :)
[12:36:25] dekroning: as a last tiny question... if i may
[12:36:39] simonstewart: sure
[12:36:41] dekroning: it's your way to inject the browser instance, when creating page objects right ?
[12:36:47] simonstewart: Right
[12:36:48] dekroning: instantiating page object i should say
[12:36:50] dekroning: ok thanks

[12:39:05] simonstewart: They're used to set the host, browser and port
[12:39:16] barancev: it creates a private instance of DefaultSelenium, what parameters to use to instantiale it?
[12:39:19] dekroning: simonstewart: so what are your plans, now your unemployed? thinking about some project to start?
[12:39:40] simonstewart: You should just be able to use the normal mechanisms we have in place when we create a selenium instance in the InternalSeleneseTestBase
[12:39:51] simonstewart: (been a while since I delved around in there, so can't remember how we do it)
[12:40:06] simonstewart: You might just want to start your own OutOfProcessSeleniumServer and get a new instance from that
[12:40:24] simonstewart: dekroning: time off with my family, then start at FB
[12:40:26] simonstewart: It's a very simple plan
[12:41:30] barancev: simonstewart: OutOfProcessSeleniumServer provides only getWebDriverUrl

[12:41:57] barancev: a new method should be added to this class?

[15:54:35] zelo: some time ago i found solution to upload files in selenium with auto it in python. There was some problem with blocking threads. Anyone know what was that about or maybe knows where i can found info about it?
[15:55:15] zelo: General idea was to activate file upload window in selenium and handle inputing file path by autoit. But when i activate file upload the thread is blocked.
[15:55:20] simonstewart: element.sendKeys(path_to_file)

[20:19:07] zmorris_: doesn't work for read-only file upload fields
[20:19:52] jimevans: it's working wonderfully in the Selenium WebDriver CI build on IE 6, 7, 8 and 9.

[20:20:25] Ardesco_H: ;)
[20:21:02] jimevans: does the <input> element also have a "readonly" attribute? it shouldn't require one to be rendered as read-only.
[20:21:33] zmorris_: yes, the input element has a readonly attribute
[20:21:58] zmorris_: it is generated by Ext-JS though if that makes any difference
[20:22:00] goddard has joined #selenium
[20:22:03] jimevans: it shouldn't. get rid of it. if you aren't the developer, file a bug with the developer. the input element shouldn't have the read-only attribute.
[20:22:42] jimevans: or use javascript to set the readonly attribute to false.
[20:22:50] jimevans: before attempting your upload.
[20:23:12] *Ardesco_H was just a little bit sick in hi mouth
[20:23:13] zmorris_: I think it is a result of the Ext-JS, not sure if it can be removed
[20:24:23] jimevans: zmorris_: Ext-JS, for all its faults, does allow a reasonable amount of customization in the html it generates.
[20:24:36] *jimevans hates extjs with a passion.
[20:27:18] zmorris_: well, it is creating a file Ext-JS field, and I think that by default has type="text" and readonly="readonly" attributes associated... I'll look for an example on changing the attribute using JS, I'm a bit rusty with my JS :(
[20:27:43] jimevans: zmorris_: aha, then that's doesn't meet the definition of a "file upload element".
[20:28:35] zmorris_: I agree
[20:28:40] jimevans: as i mentioned earlier, using .sendKeys() on a file upload element works great, provided the element in question is an actual HTML file upload element, defined as an <input> element with the type="file" attribute
[20:29:37] jimevans: so your question isn't "how do i upload files with IE7" but rather "how do i perform a file upload using the bastardized version of file upload i'm forced to use with extjs?"
[20:30:38] zmorris_: ah, ok... you are right about ext-js... I hate it. It has been a pain for testing. I will look up an example of changing the attribute and let you know if that doesn't work
[20:30:40] jimevans: so somewhere in your html, is there an actual HTML file upload element.
[20:31:19] zmorris_: yeah, there is
[20:31:27] jimevans: zmorris_: if it's an <input type="text"> element, you can change the read-only attribute, but i doubt it'll actually perform the file upload like you're hoping.
[20:32:22] jimevans: if it were me, i'd probably find *that* element (the file upload element), and use .sendKeys() to manipulate *that* one, even going so far as to forcing it visible (using javascript) if necessary.
[20:33:14] jimevans: this would all be so much easier if javascript widget framework vendors would provide webdriver-compliant libraries for testing, but that's a pipe dream
[20:33:39] *jimevans is feeling negative about vendor cooperation with webdriver today. ask him tomorrow, he'll likely have a different opinion.
[20:34:04] jimevans: actually, ask me in 10 minutes, i'll likely have a different opinion, come to think of it.
[20:34:25] zmorris_: ah, ok... I think that is the problem. Ext-JS creates this massive tree for a single element, and it's buried deep inside, and not visibile... could you provide me an example of forcing the element visible? I can do my own research, if not.

[20:40:15] rpereira_ has joined #selenium
[20:41:25] jimevans: i don't have a good example to hand. depending on how it hides the element, it'd be something like ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("arguments[0].style.display='inline';", element);
[20:41:43] jimevans: though i don't guarantee that to be syntactically correct.
[20:42:12] jimevans: and assumes you've found the html file upload element using findElement and stored it in a variable named "element"

[20:52:53] KaibutsuX: so I'm running across a bug that I've never seen before: in webelement.py:141 at send_keys(), local_file is not None and the value is being set to the actual file_location
[20:53:46] jimevans has joined #selenium
[20:53:55] KaibutsuX: so if I do ele.send_keys('selenium'), chrome is actually typing in: c:/Users/blah/AppData/Local/Temp/scoped/upload/selenium
[20:54:45] Ardesco has joined #selenium
[20:54:48] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: thats been fixed
[20:55:04] KaibutsuX: since what release?
[20:55:10] AutomatedTester: 2.26
[20:55:19] KaibutsuX: of course
[20:55:34] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: the issue is you have a file with selenium locally
[20:55:43] AutomatedTester: so it assumes its to be uploaded
[20:56:44] KaibutsuX: I don't follow, uploaded as in a file input?
[20:57:18] AutomatedTester: yes
[20:58:26] KaibutsuX: well what file does it think I'm trying to pass in?
[20:58:38] Dude-X: you have a string that matches a valid file path
[20:58:58] AutomatedTester: selenium
[20:59:07] KaibutsuX: ahh
[20:59:07] Swadq has joined #selenium
[20:59:15] KaibutsuX: well why is it only doing it when run in chrome?
[20:59:44] AutomatedTester: it should do the same with all browsers
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Sep 20 21:01:58 2012]
[21:01:58] KaibutsuX: hmm, both chrome and firefox are detecting it as a valid file, but chrome resolves value = self.upload(local_file) to the actual path, where firefox still gives 'selenium'
[21:08:09] KaibutsuX: hmm, apparently in webelement::_upload firefox is throwing a WebDriverExcetion with the "unrecognized command: POST" but chrome is succeeding in the self._execute(UPLOAD_FILE.....)
[21:10:16] KaibutsuX: well, so in 2.26 is there a different way to specify files? Or am I still at the mercy of hoping my entered data doesn't by chance match the name of a current subfolder?
[21:13:07] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: bit of both
[21:13:39] AutomatedTester: if you use remote webdriver then you are at the mercy of Selenium where it will try upload
[21:16:25] KaibutsuX: ok, but is there a recommended work-around? Let's assume my current directory, does that mean, I can never try to type in 'Windows' on a Windows box because that directory will always be present?
[21:16:41] KaibutsuX: crap, my current dir is c:

[21:17:42] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: in that case then yes
[21:18:05] KaibutsuX: and that's still the behavior in 2.26?
[21:19:17] KaibutsuX: i see issue 3871, is there now an option to suppress the file matching?

[21:21:48] AutomatedTester: no there isnt a way to block file matching
[21:23:30] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: that bug is a perfect example of people polluting bugs
[21:29:57] KaibutsuX: yeah I didn't see what the initial stuff had in relation
[21:31:12] KaibutsuX: AutomatedTester: is there a reason the send_keys doesn't check for the type=file flag before attempting to upload? I would think that would be a valid reason to not match files
[21:31:50] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: because people have bastardised HTML to do uploads
[21:32:23] AutomatedTester: and then if I block they I will get people complaining its not typing my file properly
[21:32:48] KaibutsuX: so I guess that's why firefox is throwing the exception and chrome is letting the upload go through
[21:32:55] AutomatedTester: yea
[21:33:01] AutomatedTester: ChromeDriver used to error
[21:33:05] KaibutsuX: is one browser correct in this case?
