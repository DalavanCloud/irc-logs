[00:20:29] eekboom: How do I start FF with firebug _enabled_ (not just opened)?
[00:20:38] eekboom: Tried:         profile.setPreference("extensions.firebug.script.enableSites", true);
[00:21:11] eekboom: But that stil requires a page reload before I can use the js debugger - which breaks all connected web elements.
[00:21:36] eekboom: Err, I mean _opened_, not just enabled
[00:26:06] nyx114: eekboom: you can just use the Firefox profile
[00:26:10] nyx114: and point to the .xpi

[00:40:49] jarn: I'm running into a weird issue with Selenium WebDriver (python) where it looks like Selenium is hanging if I try to do any sort of element find (e.g. find_element_by_css_selector) if the current window was just closed externally (e.g. by the website)
[00:41:12] jarn: I don't know if I've got something configured wrong or what - I have no implicit wait set up
[00:41:18] jarn: Any advice?
[00:42:03] AutomatedTester: jarn: that might be a bug, it should throw an error saying the window is closed
[00:43:41] jarn: AutomatedTester: If I try to do driver.switch_to_window after the window is closed, that throws the NoSuchWindowException, but if the window closes in between driver.switch_to_window and driver.find_element it just hangs :/
[00:44:26] jarn: AutomatedTester: I can look into opening a bug report, but I'd first need to come up with a simple website that reproduced it - what I'm running on right now is a monolith, lol
[00:53:35] AutomatedTester: jarn: try switch_to_default (hope I am remembering correctly)
[00:53:38] AutomatedTester: :apidocs

[00:54:51] AutomatedTester: switch_to_default_content()
[00:55:26] jarn: Try it where? After switch_to_window, before find_element?
[00:55:46] AutomatedTester: instead of switch_to_window
[00:56:37] AutomatedTester: anyway must dash, its rather late
[00:57:01] jarn: Okay, I'll give that a go - thanks

[11:48:48] andreastt: dawagner: The opening of the finale reminds me of the Alpine symphony by Strauss, but that was composed later, in 1915.
[11:48:48] dawagner: andreastt: Isn't it wonderful!
[11:49:39] andreastt: Yes.  I'm a big Mahler fan, but never got around to the sixth.
[11:50:00] dawagner: The brass solos in the opening of the finale made me think of three or four different pieces, but I couldn't pinpoint any of them... I'll have to listen more carefully... On the plus side, I'm seeing the Alpine Symphony on Friday :)
[11:50:21] andreastt: Oh, have you heard it live before?
[11:52:00] dawagner: No! I tried a couple of years ago, but it turned out Lang Lang was also playing at the concert, so it was a lot busier than we were expecting and we couldn't get tickets
[11:53:15] dawagner: When did opera start hiding querystrings in the URL bar??
[11:55:04] andreastt: Then you're in for a treat (-:
[11:55:24] andreastt: 11.5 or 11.6 I think.
[11:55:26] dawagner: Indeed! Particularly looking forward to the twelve off-stage horns!
[11:56:05] andreastt: And the wind machine.  And the organ.  :D
[11:56:22] andreastt: Not to mention the big metal plate.
[11:56:30] dawagner: :D
[11:56:53] andreastt: Speaking of interesting musical effects.
[11:56:53] dawagner: I wonder what organ they're going to use... As far as I know, the big one in the Royal Albert Hall is being fixed, but isn't currently playable...
[11:57:44] nyx114: does selenium support opera?
[11:57:45] nyx114: o_O
[11:58:04] andreastt: The Russian avantgardists experimented, in good accordance with the idea of social realism, with using the orchestra as a machine.

[12:01:09] andreastt: nyx114: The README is more up to date than the wiki: https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver
[12:01:50] andreastt: dawagner: The 6th is highly underrated in my opinion.
[12:02:11] dawagner: I agree!
[12:02:12] andreastt: This is way ahead of its time.  Listening to it, I can understand why it wasn't performed that often in its early days.
[12:04:24] dawagner: I think I got a slightly odd perception of it the other day as it was played after some rather... Bizarre Messiaen, which left me craving any kind of tonality
[12:04:49] andreastt: Hihi
[12:11:20] nyx114: andreastt: thanks for the info
[12:11:46] nyx114: wow

[12:12:50] nyx114: andreastt: ah ok
[12:13:06] nyx114: im extremely new to web app testing
[12:13:09] andreastt: dawagner: Oh dear.
[12:13:29] andreastt: I'm suspecting this is a bug in Opera.
[12:13:51] dawagner: Yay tests!
[12:14:00] andreastt: Indeed (-:
[12:14:14] dawagner: Also did you see my message about opera mobile + xvfb?
[12:14:16] Ajay_: dawagner: would you mind reviewing before i checkin 
[12:14:20] andreastt: Yeah.
[12:14:30] dawagner: Ajay_: Sure, dump it on codereview.appspot.com
[12:14:34] andreastt: Xvfb shouldn't matter for the window-manager.
[12:14:39] andreastt: But I'll have a look.
[12:14:57] dawagner: Well, it may be unrelated to Xvfb entirely :)
[12:15:07] dawagner: But something bad is happening :)
[12:16:04] andreastt: The advanced compilation stuff in Closure is pretty amazing stuff.

So I wonder where I should look or read about how better manage tests. Any recomendation, refers are much appreciated (cause I have no Idea where I should start looking).
[12:45:03] dawagner: You build the apk with ./go //android:android-server androidsdkpath=/path/to/sdk
[12:45:14] dawagner: Sorry, ./go clean //android:android-server androidsdkpath=/path/to/sdk
[12:45:19] dawagner: You *always* want to clean
[12:46:27] Bebe_sel: I will try building it clean 
[12:59:01] Dude-X_: xeranas, look up the Page object model, basically for a particular page you have methods that interact with elements, and your tests only use page object methods. An example is to have a class called LoginPage, where it has methods like typeUsername, typePassword, or even something like login;

[13:53:53] jimevans: rgr: you'll want to use the Actions class (or its equivalent in whatever language binding you're using). you may still run into issues in some cases depending on the browser you're running against.

[13:54:53] rgr: jimevans, any example that works? really works?
[13:55:24] rgr: Actions will simulate the mouse action? mouse over in the element that I want 'open'?

[14:00:22] jimevans: however, there are some things you need to understand about how webdriver approaches user interactions.
[14:00:45] rgr: I'm reading this page right now. http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/AdvancedUserInteractions#Mouse_interactions
[14:00:46] jimevans: are you familiar with the term "native events"?
[14:00:52] rgr: no
[14:01:06] rgr: I need to declare something before that code?
[14:01:23] jimevans: no, nothing special.
[14:02:09] rgr: I'll try more and more... thanks for you attention jimevans
[14:02:13] jimevans: there are two ways of simulating user interactions with the page. one is by hacking up javascript that fires the events that would ordinarily be fired by the user's mouse or keyboard. this is called synthetic events.
[14:02:41] jimevans: the other approach is to use the native operating system mechanisms for simulating mouse and keyboard interactions. this is called "native events"
[14:02:41] rgr: and other one?
[14:03:04] mdgreenfield1 has joined #selenium
[14:03:13] rgr: But I can use java script code inside java code to simulate on mouse over?
[14:03:18] mdgreenfield1 has left #selenium
[14:03:19] jimevans: the tricky bit is that synthetic events are the default on linux and native events are the default on windows.
[14:03:50] jimevans: if you've not explicitly turned on native events, you're already using javascript to simulate the events on linux.
[14:04:51] jimevans: so either the javascript framework you're using to build your menu system is not responding to the standard element mouse over events, or there's something else going on in your case.
[14:05:48] rgr: ok, I'll try some native events... 
[14:05:50] rgr: let's see
[14:07:47] jimevans: it's possible there's a bug in the implementation of webdriver's interaction code too, but to have any hope of verifying that there is one, much less fixing it, you'll need to supply a reproducible case.

[17:48:10] Dude-X: like div<id='blah_random">
[17:48:11] eghm: we use a framework that generates them
[17:48:31] Dude-X: well if they're random, you can't use them
[17:48:34] eghm: don't do that is the solution i have used for my own projects, but this project is a few years old
[17:48:43] lukeis: if there's anything constant in the id... you can use that piece... otherwise use classes or other locators
[17:49:23] Dude-X: in my project we have images that have random image filenames‚Ä¶ would be nice to validate just by filename but i'd have to do a file compare 
[17:49:37] Dude-X: or even better have the devs put a class indicating the type of image it is 
[17:50:33] lukeis: my ID's are generated... but follow a pattern... id="<generated stuff>:loginButton" ... so my locator is a css selector: "div[id $=':loginButton']"

[17:52:34] eghm: the place it is really getting me are on tables each has an add or delete button
[17:52:56] lukeis: then you need some context... find the row, then find the button
[17:53:18] lukeis: you can find elements from an element in webdriver... quite useful :)

[17:53:40] eghm: oh really?  I'm a bit new to webdriver, didn't realize that
[17:54:15] lukeis: ideally you just select the element, but if you need to do multiple things with a parent, then I say it's ok to find the parent then find the children as required
[17:55:09] eghm: don't 'spose you have an example of that handy? 
[17:55:30] lukeis: what language?
[17:55:56] eghm: java would be perfect but any would be fine
[17:57:11] lukeis: WebElement parent = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("tr.selected"));  WebElement button = parent.findElement(By.cssSelector("input[type='submit']"));

[18:20:18] Manoj: I am using Mac
[18:20:46] lukeis: depends... what's going on when this happens? is then when it's trying to start up firefox? does firefox launch or not at all?
[18:20:59] Manoj: but firefox is launched when I execute this Junit test
[18:21:14] lukeis: what command is it failing on then?

[18:35:56] Manoj: I using Action builder Mouse over commands in my script. I think after Mouse over line it shows this error.
[18:38:31] lukeis: Manoj: can you provide the line of code you are doing? and also it more so matters the element you are doing the action to, so html or link to page and the locator used for the element are necessary to attempt to troubleshoot your error
[18:47:58] Manoj: lukeis pls go to http://www.yatra,com
[18:48:20] Manoj: in that I am selecting the Depature Date, and I suspect that's where I am getting an error.

[21:28:35] jimevans: and IE
[21:28:38] nyx114: oh
[21:28:44] nyx114: IE is multiprocess?
[21:28:45] nyx114: O_O
[21:28:48] nyx114: did not know that
[21:28:51] jimevans: most assuredly.
[21:29:02] nyx114: still
[21:29:08] AutomatedTester: fwiw, my processes==more RAM usage
[21:29:17] AutomatedTester: more process == more RAM usage
[21:29:31] nyx114: they are both initialized as separate browsers
[21:29:51] nyx114: i'll try that though
[21:30:02] nyx114: it may well work.
[21:30:46] *lukeis missed something there... oh well ;)
[21:32:12] AutomatedTester: I really hate when Firefox builds just "freeze" but it doesnt freeze

[21:42:08] nyx114: how does the clickAt() function work?
[21:42:42] nyx114: as i understand it, selenium is completely based on javascript
[21:43:02] nyx114: ive never heard of any javascript method which can click based on coordinates.
[21:43:34] jimevans: nyx114: many of the mouse events support coordinates.
[21:43:48] nyx114: in javascript?
[21:43:58] jimevans: but that's one reason webdriver was created, so that it doesn't rely entirely on javascript.
[21:44:29] nyx114: i thought that it was entirely javascript and the webdriver just makes it easier for developers to use a language of their choice
[21:44:57] jimevans: not at all. webdriver is intended to break out of the javascript sandbox, focusing on interacting with a page as a user would.
[21:48:33] jimevans: webdriver is a fundamental rewrite of the entire browser automation stack.

[21:57:40] dawagner: Woo, in one DNS propagation delay (contegix made a mistake the first time) I can actually have ci.seleniumhq.org working!
[21:58:37] lukeis: we paid for contegix?

[22:04:38] dawagner: lukeis: I guess so...
[22:04:56] dawagner: Will have to talk to Patrick about what else we use them for, and whether we can stop that...

[22:05:54] dawagner: Want to know something incredibly depressing? A clean build of python is significantly faster than a clean build of selenium, and an incremental build of python is a hell of a lot faster than an incremental build of selenium
[22:06:23] lukeis: you mean python, like the language i'm assuming
[22:06:29] lukeis: not just our bindings ;)
[22:06:40] dawagner: Yeah, as in, python the language executable
[22:07:07] lukeis: yeah... we should fix that at some point ;)
[22:07:12] cmack2: When running Selenium grid, and there are multiple nodes with the same capabilities, how does the hub choose which node on which to run?
[22:07:41] lukeis: first one it finds i think
[22:08:06] dawagner: That's an implementation detail which may change at any time
[22:08:11] ignacio_ has joined #selenium
[22:08:29] lukeis: although i think i've seen some balancing between nodes (in the case of requesting the same browser twice will get sent to 2 nodes)
[22:08:41] dawagner: But assume it's pathalogical, i.e. will always pick the same one, or will pick a different one every time, whichever is worst for you...
[22:09:04] lukeis: in any case... you shouldn't care about which one as long as it chooses an appropriate browser :)

[22:12:25] Ajay_: whats the ruby equivalent of mvn clean install ?
[22:14:19] lukeis: Ajay_: in the selenium source or using rake or.. ?
[22:15:07] Ajay_: i am trying to build the selenium dashboard , it keeps on complaining about missing require's
[22:21:09] AutomatedTester: dawagner: a clean build of Python is about 2 mins I believe
[22:21:14] AutomatedTester: dawagner: or has it changed?
[22:22:33] KaibutsuX: is 2.26 scheduled to be released this week?
[22:22:35] dawagner: AutomatedTester: Something like that, yeah
[22:22:43] dawagner: A clean build of selenium is a hell of a lot slower than that
[22:22:56] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: not sure
[22:23:26] *AutomatedTester actually hasnt seen Simon for a while so havent asked him
[22:23:59] dawagner: I think the only thing blocking it is native events
[22:24:03] *AutomatedTester carries on bashing his head against the Firefox build system
[22:25:20] AutomatedTester: is it too much to ask for it to package some files for me in an incremental build?
