[11:19:25] Ardesco: cheers
[11:19:57] Ardesco: would capabilities.setCapability(CapabilityType.HAS_NATIVE_EVENTS,false); do that?

[11:25:36] simonstewart: We cant fire the pseudo selectors without them

[11:27:03] Ardesco: i have the browser in focus
[11:27:08] Ardesco: the mouse off the browser window
[11:27:26] Ardesco: but the hover element is still flickering in IE
[11:27:49] simonstewart: Try the IEDriverServer.exe that's in HEAD right now

[12:52:09] RossPatterson has joined #selenium
[12:52:10] ChanServ has altered RossPatterson's mode: +o
[12:55:49] simonstewart: So, some of the feedback on the spec has suggested avoiding magic numbers for the status codes in the Response object, and using strings instead
[12:55:54] simonstewart: How do people feel about this?
[12:57:16] RossPatterson: Hmm ...
[12:57:32] RossPatterson: Magic numbers have a long and successful history in IETF specs.
[12:57:36] RossPatterson: They've worked well.
[12:59:19] barancev: who matters what's inside the engine
[12:59:21] RossPatterson: But given that the spec uses IDL, aren't Enums available in IDL?
[12:59:28] barancev: for a dev it's easier to deal with a number
[12:59:46] barancev: (to compare, to analyse)
[12:59:54] barancev: harder to make a typo :)
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Sep 27 13:00:03 2012]
[13:00:03] simonstewart: Enums are pretty nasty in some languages (eg: you can't add to java enums)
[13:00:20] simonstewart: barancev: a dev should be using constants defined in a header somewhere
[13:00:49] barancev: sure, and the constant can have a redable name
[13:00:58] RossPatterson: Harder to have upper vs. lower case problems.  Many SMTP implementations take mixed case commands and return numeric results.  But the original SMTP spec required *upper case* commands, and it was changed only because some programmers apparently can't read.
[13:00:59] barancev: who matters the value of this constant?
[13:02:29] simonstewart: The feedback was that no-one really knows what the numbers mean
[13:02:42] simonstewart: (eg: what does nodeType = 9 mean in the DOM?)
[13:03:17] simonstewart: Whereas strings are far more unambiguous
[13:03:26] RossPatterson: When they're typed correctly.
[13:03:35] barancev: +1
[13:03:37] RossPatterson: "9" is pretty unambiguous
[13:03:40] simonstewart: See comment above about constants
[13:03:47] simonstewart: But its meaning isn't clear
[13:03:58] barancev: and if you use constants -- no matter if it is 9 or some string
[13:04:15] barancev: it's not a number or a srting it's actually a symbol
[13:04:33] RossPatterson: Not in all languages - C, for example, an int and a string are radically different
[13:04:47] simonstewart: Indeed they are
[13:05:00] RossPatterson: You can't do switch (myString) ...
[13:05:10] RossPatterson: etc.
[13:05:22] simonstewart: Depends on your language
[13:05:28] simonstewart: Even java 7 can switch on strings :)
[13:05:44] RossPatterson: Yup
[13:06:12] RossPatterson: But we're talking about the spec, not about how it is surfaced into a programming language by a library.
[13:06:34] simonstewart: Yes
[13:06:40] simonstewart: And the feedback was in that context
[13:06:56] RossPatterson: And in the spec, we have lots of strings going back and forth, with plenty of room for minor mistakes.  One more opportunity won't hurt much more, even if it's not the best option.
[13:07:36] simonstewart: And it may be the best option
[13:07:52] simonstewart: (as someone who has read a reasonable amount of raw JSON in his time)
[13:09:00] andreastt: I'm comfortable with the use of numbers TBH.
[13:09:07] RossPatterson: Integral numbers are parts of a set that is usually interpreted to have an ordering function.  Thus groups of integral values are often treated as similar to each other.  HTTP's 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx are good examples.
[13:09:11] andreastt: Passing strings is expensive, but I'm not sure if anyone suggested that.
[13:09:45] andreastt: Yes.  Cleaning up the categories and number ranges might be a good idea though.
[13:09:51] simonstewart: So I'm hearing pretty clearly that people like their numbers
[13:10:04] simonstewart: andreastt: well, that's going to be fun :)
[13:10:07] andreastt: I agree with the notation that enums are nasty.
[13:10:20] simonstewart: But yes, we should probably tidy up the error codes
[13:10:21] barancev: strings can have prefixes that define categories
[13:10:56] RossPatterson: I like numbers because they provide a limited set of valid values.  Like enums.
[13:10:59] andreastt: It's fine if a driver implementation uses an enum to store to reference the error codes.
[13:11:17] simonstewart: Sure
[13:11:25] barancev: I'm neutral about string vs number, because actually they are enums (or symbols, philosophically speaking)
[13:11:37] RossPatterson: I strongly believe that a specification should be prescriptive and should attempt to gurantee interoperability.
[13:11:44] *RossPatterson hates "profiles" in specs.
[13:12:17] simonstewart: RossPatterson: interop matters a lot
[13:12:45] simonstewart: Though we've left encoding of Command/Response objects and transmission protocols undefined
[13:12:53] RossPatterson: andreastt: We had a debate in the HTTP 1.1 committee over the cost of passing long strings.  Because HTTP header names are comparitively large.  Both camps lost on that one :-(
[13:13:00] simonstewart: Because there are at least four differnt ways implemented already that I'm aware of
[13:13:29] RossPatterson: Yes, I'm concerned about that, as I think I pointed out in my comments.
[13:13:30] simonstewart: (HTTP/JSON, scope, marionette's way of doing things, Protobufs over TCP)
[13:13:58] andreastt: + WS
[13:14:12] AutomatedTester: WS?
[13:14:14] simonstewart: As long as there's a clear way to transform the commands/responses from one format to another you're okay
[13:14:16] andreastt: WebSockets
[13:14:43] simonstewart: And there's a (small) part of the spec that talks about handling additional fields on a command/response
[13:14:52] simonstewart: Oh yeah. WebSockets too
[13:19:11] simonstewart: So, defining the transport and encoding mechanisms is probably not something that we have scope to do
[13:19:17] simonstewart: (no pun intended)

[14:10:19] simonstewart: Starting to go through your comments now and fold them into the spec
[14:10:21] simonstewart: (finally)
[14:10:27] simonstewart: (apologies for taking so long)
[14:10:38] RossPatterson: No problemo.
[14:10:41] simonstewart: The interop thing is fun
[14:10:46] simonstewart: Yes, we want it
[14:10:47] RossPatterson: And scary :-)
[14:11:03] simonstewart: But, as has been mentioned here already, there's already 5 different ways for things to be implemented
[14:11:09] RossPatterson: I know that.  But I had to say it, because it's the elephant in the room :-)
[14:11:16] simonstewart: Well, yes :)
[14:11:32] simonstewart: Want to suggest how to phrase this?
[14:11:54] simonstewart: I'm tempted to add something to the non-normative part of the spec to do with JSON over HTTP
[14:13:08] simonstewart: "It is strongly recommended that all implementations of the remote end provide an end point that works with a local end using the JSON over HTTP protocol described in appendix XXX"
[14:14:26] RossPatterson: That's often how it's done - to describe one possible encoding/etc. in a non-normative section and then to privately encourage EVERYONE to support it.  The other common way is to mandate one lowest-common-denominator encoding/etc. and allow "cooperating implementations" to use something different, either through in-band, out-of-band, or prior-knowlege of agreement.  (e.g., HTTP vs. SPDY)
[14:15:12] simonstewart: OK
[14:15:36] simonstewart: I can see why (eg) the mobile phone vendors might not want a minimal TCP-based encoding
[14:15:43] simonstewart: rather than a full http server running on the phone
[14:15:58] RossPatterson: s/might not/might/ ?
[14:16:12] RossPatterson: Sure.
[14:16:48] simonstewart: You're right about that replacement :)
[14:16:59] simonstewart: Hmmm
[14:17:12] detronizator: jimevans: what's up?
[14:17:20] simonstewart: We could just write all the conformance tests using the JSON/HTTP protocol
[14:17:48] jimevans: detronizator: where's the code that detects a new page load in ghostdriver? is it at the phantomjs level?
[14:18:10] RossPatterson: simonstewart: That would certainly encourage JSON/HTTP support :-)
[14:18:45] simonstewart: I think that's what we'll do. Wording in the spec to encourage it, conformance tests that rely on it
[14:18:53] RossPatterson: SGTM
[14:21:14] barancev: goog.dom.getFrameContentWindow throws an unknown exception "a.contentWindow is null" if a frame was present on a page but was deleted
[14:21:22] barancev: interesting...
[14:22:59] barancev: or, more precisely, getFrameContentDocument attepts to get a.contentWindow.document, but a.contentWindow is null
[14:23:36] simonstewart: RossPatterson: there you go: http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html#commands-and-responses
[14:24:06] barancev: goog.dom can't be fixed, so we need a workaround
[14:24:42] AutomatedTester: barancev: could the workaround be the current implementation?
[14:24:51] AutomatedTester: :P
[14:26:01] barancev: may be, I'm thinking about it
[14:26:29] barancev: atom implementation looks better, but firefox implementation works :)
[14:27:15] AutomatedTester: barancev: move parts of the Firefox implementation into the atoms?
[14:27:17] davehunt has joined #selenium
[14:27:22] AutomatedTester: and then add a conditional...
[14:27:33] detronizator: jimevans: you mean "page.onLoadFinished" event?
[14:28:13] barancev: AutomatedTester: bad idea with condition, imho
[14:28:38] AutomatedTester: because...
[14:28:51] jimevans: detronizator: i guess. i'm looking at an issue with getting the text of the title element, and I'm just trying to figure out if it's that we're looking at the wrong document, or if our window object is incorrect or what.
[14:29:21] RossPatterson: simonstewart: That looks good.
[14:29:39] barancev: better, I'll reimplement goog.dom.getFrameContentWindow in more safe manner

[14:29:56] simonstewart: Still relatively new at this game, so feedback is always welcome, and (eventually) acted upon.
[14:31:54] detronizator: jimevans: well, I use "onLoadFinished" is used in ghostDriver only when I know that an action, by WireProtocol, is supposed to cause a page load. otherwise actions are executed and it's up to the user to set the right code to figure out if the result of that action is finished
[14:32:30] jimevans: right. okay.
[14:32:36] jimevans: i see the problem now.
[14:34:14] jimevans: detronizator: i'm debugging the .NET version of shouldSwitchBackToMainFrameIfLinkInFrameCausesTopFrameReload
[14:34:44] jimevans: but it may not be symptomatic of that particular test. let me distill it a little further.
[14:38:01] jimevans: detronizator: okay. got it. here's the bug. element.getText() for a <title> element should return the document title, but it doesn't in ghostdriver.
[14:38:46] jimevans: detronizator: this should all be handled in the getText atom, but there's a conditional that makes sure the window of the owner document of the element is the same as window.top, and that's failing.
[14:40:59] detronizator: is that check in the atom or in ghostdriver?
[14:41:53] jimevans: that check is in the atom.
[14:42:13] detronizator: so, is the atom broken? weird...
[14:43:03] jimevans: detronizator: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/webdriver/atoms/element.js#172
[14:45:58] detronizator: in other words, it allows to read the title of an element, only if that is from the _top
[14:46:03] AutomatedTester: :spec
[14:46:03] selbot2_: http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html | http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/
[14:47:02] jimevans: it means the text of a <title> element should be the document title, but only if we are focused on the top-level window.
[14:47:49] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: looking at your comments for 10.4 (http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html#rendering-text) but the normalise-space() function does what we do it isnt as clear cut as ours...
[14:47:51] jimevans: but wait. this *should* be working.
[14:48:00] AutomatedTester: looking at the XPath W3C document
[14:48:30] *jimevans is deconstructing the google closure code to figure out what we should be getting.

[14:48:54] rpereira has joined #selenium
[14:50:40] AutomatedTester: and one of the bits of feedback we got was that we dont describe things in a testable manner
[14:51:50] barancev: what's the roadmap to 2.26?
[14:52:02] RossPatterson: AutomatedTester: I don't see anything open to interpretation in "The normalize-space function returns the argument string with whitespace normalized by stripping leading and trailing whitespace and replacing sequences of whitespace characters by a single space. Whitespace characters are the same as those allowed by the S production in XML. If the argument is omitted, it defaults to the context node converted to a string, in othe
[14:52:02] RossPatterson: r words the string-value of the context node." (where "S" and "string-value" are clearly defined elsewhere).
[14:52:53] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: maybe its me... let me read again :)
[14:52:55] jimevans: detronizator: i'm wrong about the window thing, unless bot.window_ isn't returning what we think it should be.
[14:57:38] RossPatterson: AutomatedTester: My point is that, where a well-defined rule is already specified elsewhere, and where other items are included in this spec from there by reference, one more won't hurt, and explictly requiring congruity is a Good Thing.
[14:58:05] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: and I totally agree on that point
[14:58:11] AutomatedTester: where possible we should be doing that
[14:59:11] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: I guess I am being over pedantic on this to make sure its done in the right format :)
[14:59:23] RossPatterson: And that's a good thing!
[14:59:30] AutomatedTester: in a testable and unambiguous format

[15:04:27] detronizator: jimevans: I see the behaviour you describe. I think it's a matter of atom only. Or the way I use it. Because the title retrieved in this way always returns ""
[15:04:43] detronizator: even if I just load the page and ask for it, before any switching to any frame

[15:05:00] jimevans: yep, that's what i'm seeing.
[15:06:16] jimevans: the atom checks to see if the element is in the <head>, an if so, checks to see we have an element with tagName "title". something somewhere in that string of conditionals is not correct.

[16:23:22] jimevans: true that. but what are the test targets for the injected atoms?

[16:24:15] detronizator: inside the tools directory?
[16:24:18] jimevans: yeah, i found it.
[16:24:26] detronizator: any discovery?
[16:24:55] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[16:25:46] jimevans: detronizator: the problem is that regular drivers use webdriver.atoms.element.getText for the getText atom, but the injected atoms are wrapping bot.dom.getVisibleText, which doesn't do the <title> element handling.
[16:26:41] jimevans: the injected atoms should be wrapping webdriver.atoms.element.getText to get the same behavior, but i don't know yet if that would introduce other weirdness. testing now to find out.
[16:27:21] detronizator: k - so I assume I don't have to change the atom I import: it's the atom inside that has to change. right?
[16:28:05] jimevans: detronizator: right. if this doesn't look like it breaks anything, i'll ask you to re-import the atoms.
[16:28:38] detronizator: jimevans: ANOTHER option - what about doing something different; what about writing the atom as I did for "action.js"
[16:28:44] detronizator: I needed something that didn't exist
[16:28:45] detronizator: I wrote it
[16:29:03] detronizator: and the build/inject I do works without issues for the other browsers
[16:30:07] jimevans: yeah, but the bottom line is the injected getText atom is wrapping the wrong thing. it needs to be fixed anyway.
[16:31:32] detronizator: jimevans: OK. But I'm sure we are going to affect people - after all you did discover this doing something pretty "ordinary" - getting the text from the title.

[16:38:42] jimevans: detronizator: good question. jleyba is the expert, but "injected" ones handle wrap everything inside an executeScript() call, and returns the json response ready to be transmitted back to the client. non-injected ones return whatever they return, and the caller of those is responsible for crafting the proper json response.
[16:38:47] detronizator: jimevans: ok, I found my answer in the code.

[17:06:42] selbot2_: santiycr: note from dawagner 1 day ago: the sort-order of scout browsers is a bit weird... 
[17:06:42] selbot2_: santiycr: note from dawagner 1 day ago: scout also seems a bit broken? https://saucelabs.com/scout/live/dafbb9d654ea4e538c97cdce10b1627d has just been hanging waiting to load a page for a while, on a Suace Labs background, for example 
[17:06:42] selbot2_: santiycr: note from dawagner about 19 hours ago: I left you a note at https://gist.github.com/3790741 :) 
[17:07:09] dawagner: Hey santiycr :)
[17:07:13] santiycr: oh hai!
[17:07:36] santiycr: what's up, dawagner 
[17:07:43] dawagner: heh
[17:08:03] dawagner: So it turns out some of our javascript reliably crashes IE6 on Sauce, but not on jimevans's IE6
[17:08:23] santiycr: interesting
[17:08:25] dawagner: I got about as far as I could debugging without actual access to the machine
[17:08:31] santiycr: we have made new windows xp images last week
[17:08:33] santiycr: maybe this is related
[17:08:39] dawagner: https://gist.github.com/3790741 has details and repro steps

[17:09:03] santiycr: wonder whether the version of IE we support has changed
[17:09:09] santiycr: IE6, I mean
[17:10:32] santiycr: dawagner, jimevans which specific version of IE6 have you guys tested locally?
[17:15:33] nachete has joined #selenium
[17:16:25] santiycr: dawagner, jimevans this is the version change in our new VM:
[17:16:27] santiycr: -      "6.0.2900.5512.": "6",
[17:16:27] santiycr: +      "6.0.3790.3959.": "6",
[17:16:37] santiycr: so, we upgraded to a more recent IE6
[17:16:49] santiycr: I'll make a support ticket and investigate

[17:37:37] santiycr: cool, tks

[17:39:36] santiycr: wonder if 6.0.3790.3959 is the problem
[17:39:49] santiycr: or if it's just a misconfiguration of our vm
[17:40:16] jimevans: i'm flipping through the list of windows updates to see if there are any that look appropriate.

[17:47:01] Archdude: does webdriver not work well on gmail for some reason?
[17:47:07] Archdude: it doesn't seem to want to capture any element for me
[17:47:25] Dude-X: gmail is a horrific mess to parse
[17:47:37] Dude-X: but it should work with webdriver
[17:47:41] *RossPatterson looks around for adamgoucher :-)
[17:47:42] jimevans: Archdude: gmail is an incredibly complex application. the only reason to ever automate it is if you work for google, testing gmail.
[17:47:48] Archdude: i considered using a module such as libgmail but i figured its easier to just have it go there in driver
[17:48:10] jimevans: especially since i believe gmail offers both pop3 and imap access.
[17:48:24] RossPatterson: Archdude: Unless you're actually TRYING to test GMail, you're MUCH better off using something like an IMAP client to access it.
[17:48:31] Archdude: yeah
[17:48:37] Archdude: i'll give that a try
[17:48:55] jab416171|Cloud has joined #selenium
[17:49:06] jimevans: automation is great, but never automate a ui unless you absolutely have to.
[17:50:26] Archdude: it's weird 
[17:50:45] Archdude: if i do something like get_element_by_xpath("//span[@id='xY']")
[17:50:48] Archdude: it wouldn't capture it
[17:50:51] Archdude: even though it was right there
[17:51:04] Archdude: same for by class/css
[17:51:26] Archdude: jimevans: yeah, i'm just going to do it via imaplib
[17:51:29] sfbrian has joined #selenium
[17:51:42] Dude-X: Archdude: when there's a lot of javascript going on, webdriver will be "blocked"
[17:51:44] Archdude: find*
[17:52:24] Archdude: if you do path on //body
[17:52:31] Dude-X: a useful plugin is FireDiff for Firebug and find out what's the last element updated, and try to wait for it to be visible or available
[17:52:36] Archdude: it returns 'If you are using a screen reader, you may wish to switch to basic HTML for a better experience.'
[17:52:37] Archdude: lol
[17:52:49] Dude-X: nifty
[17:53:15] Archdude: xpath*
[17:53:40] Dude-X: learn CSS selectors, it's faster better browser compatibility
[17:54:03] Dude-X: xpath is only good for unusual traversal of the DOM
[17:54:11] davehunt: Archdude: also, Gmail has keyboard shortcuts that you could use
[17:54:23] Archdude: oh right
[17:54:25] davehunt: but like others have already said, don't automate a UI that you don't have to
[17:56:19] santiycr: jimevans: kind of stuck on the 2003 server vs xp issue
[17:56:49] *adamgoucher thinks his work is done here now. at least as far as brainwashing RossPatterson and jimevans is concerned :)
[17:57:27] santiycr: jimevans: any suggestions? (I don't think I can downgrade to 6.0.2900 and I don't know how to test whether this is a config issue
[17:57:35] *jimevans didn't need brainwashing in that respect. :)
[17:57:51] *adamgoucher is going to take credit anyways :P
[17:57:56] jimevans: :)
[17:58:13] jimevans: santiycr: i'll have to think about that. i don't know of one off the top of my head.
[17:58:20] jimevans: don't really have a 2003 image handy
[17:58:37] santiycr: are you using vmware?
[17:58:41] santiycr: or virtualbox?
[17:58:45] jimevans: virtualbox.
[17:59:03] santiycr: maybe I can give you our current disk image
[17:59:15] santiycr: and you can boot it in your own virtualbox to investigate
[17:59:52] jimevans: maybe. did 2003 come with ie enhanced security?
