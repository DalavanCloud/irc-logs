[15:15:36] freynaud: dawagner: hi. have you worked with the iPhone driver ?
[15:16:27] dawagner: Hi freynaud
[15:16:36] dawagner: You want lukeis
[15:16:59] dawagner: But I've vaguely touched it briefly, and gotten scared and run away a couple of times...
[15:17:08] freynaud: ok. I'm trying to see if there is a way to launch on a specific simulator
[15:17:37] freynaud: when i work with the simulator, it always launches the latest I have installed on the OS
[15:18:45] dawagner: I've used https://github.com/moredip/iphonesim which lets you specify an sdkversion
[15:20:22] freynaud: i'll see if there is a magic param I can use. I'm using Instruments to start the simulator, and the command line help for that is rather sparse
[15:20:33] freynaud: it seems apple wants everybody to use the UI ...
[15:21:02] dawagner: Ick

[15:36:36] jarib: :note Ajay the ci dashboard should a little bit more mobile-friendly now (may need to reset your browser cache to see it correctly)
[15:36:37] selbot2: ok!
[15:46:15] freynaud: dawagner: it does what I need, but programatically. I need to set that command line now ^^

[21:59:27] lukeis: generalconsensus:  you don't need 'exact:' nor 'glob:'  in there, I think you can just do those without them
[21:59:38] *lukeis doesn't really use IDE though ;)
[21:59:54] generalconsensus: @lukeis most folks use the more up to date webdriver?
[IRC logfile - Started Sun Sep  9 22:00:05 2012]
[22:00:05] lukeis: yes
[22:00:15] lukeis: and in webdriver for id it's always exact match
[22:00:29] generalconsensus: no wildcards for webdriver??
[22:00:48] lukeis: for the example you gave I would use css (example):  "*[id ^= 'edit-edit-delete-']"
[22:01:14] lukeis: no, no wild cards, but as you can see plenty of things you can do with css ;)
[22:12:59] generalconsensus: @lukeis thanks! I'll try to build things in 2.0 from now on
