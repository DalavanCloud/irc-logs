[16:38:30] andreastt: dawagner: Which XML deserialization libraries should I be looking at?  I like GSON for JSON, but I've never done anything with XML in Java before.
[16:38:48] andreastt: A colleague of mine wrote a piece of code that deserializes some XML files, and it's justâ€¦ horrible.
[16:38:54] andreastt: There must be a better way.
[16:40:06] dawagner: andreastt: I've avoided XML in Java my entire life.  I fundamentally object.
[16:40:09] dawagner: (Sorry :p)
[16:40:29] andreastt: Wise choice.
[16:40:46] ccooper1: are you looking for object marshalling?
[16:40:51] ccooper1: or just xml parsing
[16:41:27] andreastt: Just parsing.
[16:41:43] andreastt: Apparently we store test profiles for builds in XML for some insane reason.
[16:42:18] andreastt: dawagner: STP/0 (the predecessor of STP/1 in Scope) used XML.  We luckily averted disaster before writing OperaDriver. d-:
[16:43:01] ccooper1: its too bad you can't use groovy
[16:43:04] ccooper1: makes it real easy

[18:41:31] jleyba: andreastt: Is it possible to start Opera with the popup blocker disabled?
[18:43:53] *jimevans sighs heavily, as if the weight of the world was on his shoulders.
[18:47:17] anlee has joined #selenium
[18:47:42] jimevans: can we as a group of influencers please beat people up every time they use the INTRODUCE_FLAKINESS_BY_IGNORING_SECURITY_DOMAINS capability in IE?
[18:48:25] jimevans: (unless they can prove they really, Really, REALLY know what they're doing)
[18:51:43] jimevans: i mean, i really would've thought something with a big honkin' scary name like INTRODUCE_FLAKINESS would discourage its use, but i guess not.
[18:54:25] anlee: have anyone encountered a behaviour when running multiple tests in parallel using the grid, when there are 2 or more tests waiting for a node, the node stalled (browser stop doing anything), and I see exception: "OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriverException: No response from server for url http://prdev-goliath:4444/wd/hub/session".  I found something with issue 2424 but its already closed...

[19:12:38] santiycr: adamgoucher:  yt?
[19:12:42] jimevans has left #selenium
[19:13:22] adamgoucher: yup
[19:13:25] andreastt: jleyba: The later versions of OperaDriver disable the popup blocker by default.
[19:13:45] toabctl has joined #selenium
[19:14:16] andreastt: jleyba: But if you want to do it explicitly, do this:
[19:14:20] andreastt: driver.preferences().set("User Prefs", "Ignore Unrequested Popups", false);
[19:14:50] andreastt: jleyba: Since OperaProfile also share the same OperaArguments interface, you can do that on profile.arguments() too if you want to do it before startup.
[19:15:43] santiycr: adamgoucher:  looking for how to get the session id from your php-webdriver lib
[19:15:49] santiycr has left #selenium
[19:15:53] jleyba: andreastt: Any way to do this through DesiredCapabilities? 
[19:15:58] santiycr has joined #selenium
[19:17:05] santiycr: adamgoucher:  trying to build links to sauce jobs
[19:19:00] andreastt: jleyba: Nope.

[19:19:26] adamgoucher: santiycr: $this->sessionId = substr($this->session->getURL(), strrpos($this->session->getURL(), "/") + 1);
[19:19:29] andreastt: jleyba: Well.
[19:19:49] santiycr: adamgoucher:  oh wow
[19:19:50] andreastt: jleyba: Technically you can create a new OperaProfile instance and pass that in through the opera.profile capability.
[19:19:51] santiycr: thanks :)
[19:20:00] andreastt: jleyba: But are you using a very old version?
[19:20:44] adamgoucher: santiycr: in saunterphp i get that out in setup() and then set the tags, etc. afterwards with it
[19:21:16] santiycr: I see
[19:21:31] santiycr: the clean session id is never stored by itself
[19:21:55] adamgoucher: santiycr: see also https://github.com/Element-34/saunter.php/blob/master/SaunterPHP/Framework/Listeners/StatusListener.php#L41
[19:24:37] adamgoucher: santiycr: nope. feel free to do something around https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver/blob/master/PHPWebDriver/WebDriverBase.php#L95 though is likely the right place for it
[19:25:58] santiycr: thanks for the details
[19:26:21] santiycr: I'll fork and make a pull request

[21:51:55] DaveIngram: I'm trying to the element() method that's on an element to select child elements in saunter.php and it's not giving me any results… anyone have any success with this?
[21:52:07] DaveIngram: *trying to use
[21:52:08] adamgoucher: ya. i think thats a bug
[21:52:25] DaveIngram: meh
[21:52:26] *adamgoucher fixed that in py.saunter but will likely have to on saunterphp over the weekend
[21:53:14] adamgoucher: (its annoyingly hard to keep two things in synch in terms of behaviour and bug fixens)
[21:55:07] DaveIngram: I can believe that
[21:55:19] DaveIngram: I guess it's something with WebDriverContainer.php?
[21:56:00] adamgoucher: nope. its in saunter. its not casting the returned objects properly
[21:58:38] adamgoucher: actually. that should work looking at the code. is your element object of type SaunterPHP_Framework_Bindings_SaunterWebDriverSession or PHPWebDriver_WebDriverSession
[21:59:40] DaveIngram: thought it was a WebDriverElement ...checking
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Sep  7 22:01:38 2012]
[22:01:38] DaveIngram: yea, PHPWebDriver_WebDriverElement
[22:01:52] DaveIngram: This is what I'm doing: $parent = self::$session->find_element_by_locator($element['locator']);
[22:01:52] DaveIngram:         $inputs = $parent->elements('css selector', 'input');
[22:02:33] *adamgoucher fires up some editors
[22:03:12] *DaveIngram just realized he should be using 'tag name' there instead of css selector
[22:04:22] adamgoucher: that should still work
[22:07:27] DaveIngram: yeah, didn't make a difference.. just seemed more logical
[22:09:46] DaveIngram: In WebDriverContainer.php the element method is posting to '/element' …should it not be 'element/:id/element'? (I don't have a clue, just looking at the JsonWireProtocol and wondering)
[22:13:31] adamgoucher: this looks like a legit oversite. the WebDriverElement doesn't know how to do that it seems.
[22:14:06] adamgoucher: actually. nevermind. its in the parent.
[22:14:40] DaveIngram: so the WebDriverElement needs to override the WebDriverContainer's implementation of the element method?
[22:15:44] adamgoucher: yes. i think that is the case
[22:15:57] adamgoucher: (and was just changing windows to say that)
[22:16:05] DaveIngram: :)
[22:17:09] adamgoucher: feel free to fork and issue a pull request. between this and santiycr's session change its looking like i'm going to spin out a release this weekend
[22:17:14] jfunk has joined #selenium
[22:17:42] DaveIngram: OK… I'm trying this: '/element/' . $this->getID() . '/element' …does that look right to you?
[22:18:58] DaveIngram: oh, and I'm not sure what I've done here.. you have a separate PHPWebDriver project, but I have a PHPWebDriver directory in my SaunterPHP directory… is that something weird that I've done or is that correct?
[22:20:33] adamgoucher: i think this is something you have done :)
[22:20:47] DaveIngram: I thought so.. just looking at that in the repo
[22:21:01] DaveIngram: I had only just noticed that and not sure how I managed that
[22:21:04] *DaveIngram goes to fix that
[22:22:28] adamgoucher: in theory, something lik http://pastebin.com/QYawT6LC needs to go in the element class
[22:23:28] adamgoucher: heck, heres even the test i whipped up to see if it would work http://pastebin.com/d80fhadn
[22:24:03] *adamgoucher is off to go get pizza otherwise might do it himself
[22:31:17] DaveIngram: hmm… that didn't work
[22:36:47] DaveIngram: adamgoucher: the problem doesn't seem to be with the post url.. that change made it post to 'element/7/element/7/element' …not quite right… reverted and checked the actual post url and it's posting to 'element/7/element' which looks right, but I'm getting an empty array returned from that call
[22:37:57] o3u has joined #selenium
[22:41:06] DaveIngram: bingo
[22:42:45] DaveIngram: adamgoucher: problem was in webDriverElement() ..is_a($this, "PHPWebDriver_WebDriverSession") was wrapping the return, so when $this was a WebDriverElement, as in this case, the method was returning null
[22:45:36] stephend has joined #selenium
[22:51:17] DaveIngram: adamgoucher: hmm… but it looks like you've taken that check out of HEAD already
[22:51:44] adamgoucher: hrm. are you curent?
[22:52:05] DaveIngram: apparently not
[22:56:04] adamgoucher: last release was on monday last week
[22:56:13] DaveIngram: adamgoucher: will pear upgrade get me the latest?
[22:56:25] adamgoucher: in theory
[22:59:29] DaveIngram: yeah, that did it
[22:59:32] *DaveIngram shakes his head
[22:59:38] DaveIngram: looks like that should fix it for me
[22:59:55] DaveIngram: well, at least I'm a good bit more familiar with the code now
[22:59:56] adamgoucher: you also just got android support
