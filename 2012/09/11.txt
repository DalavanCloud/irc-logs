[08:47:25] davehunt: :note dawagner Nice! Yeah, I was expecting some followup tweaks. Could I get access at all to make future improvements?

[08:47:26] selbot2: ok!
[08:49:31] djonsson: Hi, I am looking for a tool to aid manual testing on a website. What I am after is something that could create annotations, sticky notes and todo-list on top of a web page, and that this information is shared in the cloud so that all departments (development, qa, design) can collaborate. Does this tool exist? :)
[08:53:18] davehunt: adamgoucher: Hey, I'll be in Toronto between 23-28th October, as will AutomatedTester. Not sure how much free time I'll have, but let me know if there's a Selenium meetup likely to happen, or any other chance to catch up. :)

[13:44:52] jimevans: trying to figure out the best integration points of that for the atoms.
[13:45:34] simonstewart: I'll have a hack in a bit
[13:45:41] simonstewart: There's a couple of things on my list to get to
[13:45:45] simonstewart: But the main thing would be:
[13:45:56] simonstewart: Add a goog.require to the xpath element locators
[13:46:10] simonstewart: Add a guard that says "if on IE, use wicked good xpath"
[13:46:15] simonstewart: Otherwise use the main one
[13:46:21] simonstewart: Let the compiler deal with the mess
[13:46:53] jimevans: ah. i was going to feature-detect, but you're right, the "if on IE" check will compile it all away for non-IE browsers.
[13:47:04] simonstewart: And will work in the atoms when we compile them
[13:47:11] jimevans: (since there's already feature detection in the atom)

[13:51:58] simonstewart: Add a wait in after the click
[13:52:03] simonstewart: arse
[13:52:10] simonstewart: You're already using implicit waits
[13:52:12] simonstewart: k
[13:52:41] simonstewart: That "mvoe to element", does it cause something to appear because of mouseover or the :hover selector?
[13:53:34] barancev: *after* the click? hm... an excellent idea!
[13:54:33] barancev: is looks like fiefox selects an item from the dropdown, but the menu can't close properly

[14:38:14] eranm: In this specific test case, the menu doesn't pop-up because the mouse cursor is moved to the middle of the element, which has no text *or* background
[14:38:32] eranm: If the element's background changes, then the menu would pop-up
[14:38:55] eranm: (That's the element 'menu1' in javascriptPage.html)
[14:39:36] Archdude has joined #selenium
[14:39:44] eranm: So a user-friendly solution would be to detect this condition (where we have a text node inside the div element) and move to the mouse to a different position
[14:39:52] eranm: Can you think of an easy way to do it in the IE driver?
[14:40:13] eranm: BTW, Firefox behaves differently: Move the mouse to anywhere within this element's bounding client rect and the menu will pop-up

[14:42:00] jimevans: you need to, what, actually put the cursor over the text in IE?

[14:44:49] simonstewart: How tedious
[14:45:07] simonstewart: I imagine that we need to check whether the first child is a text node
[14:45:20] simonstewart: If it is, we need to get the dimensions and move to the middle of _that_

[15:00:14] ruel: I'm using the firefox driver
[15:01:47] ruel: Ive attached a profiler and profiled the operation.  It can be seen here:  https://gist.github.com/3698895
[15:02:21] ruel: Execution time seems to be spent in:  org.openqa.selenium.remote.HttpCommandExecutor.fallBackExecute(HttpContext, HttpUriRequest)                |  14,813   98 %  |              0  |
[15:03:57] jimevans: ruel: getText() is the one of the most computationally expensive operations webdriver does.
[15:04:51] ruel: Sure, but thats not where the time is being spent
[15:05:03] ruel: all the time is being spent in the findElements call

[15:05:43] jimevans: never mind me, i'm an idiot
[15:06:00] ruel: No prob.    I wasn't sure if there was a best practice regarding the use of findElements that i was maybe not aware of

[15:12:14] andreastt: AutomatedTester, simonstewart: FWIW I'm not on www-dom@ list.
[15:12:51] ruel: thats interesting.    Setting the implicit wait to 300 ms makes the bottleneck go away.    What is the relation to the implicit wait and findElements?
[15:12:57] simonstewart: andreastt: I cc'd you so that it'd be easy for you to point the opera rep at it :)

[15:58:51] simonstewart: You need to have a build.desc file that defines a new js_library in the wgxpath dir
[15:58:55] aweiteka has joined #selenium
[15:59:04] simonstewart: Then add a dep to that library to anything that actually needs to use the library
[15:59:15] simonstewart: And make sure you add a "goog.require" in the right place.

[16:00:11] simonstewart: ok
[16:00:34] jimevans: and to be clear, it should just be "goog.require('wgxpath');" right?
[16:00:49] simonstewart: I'd need to look at the code to see what it provides
[16:00:57] jimevans: that's what it provides.
[16:01:14] simonstewart: then that's what you need :)
[16:01:20] jimevans: or so says the goog.provide() call :)
[16:01:45] simonstewart: that's what eneds to match
[16:01:54] jimevans: so then the tricky bit is knowing what targets need the dependency.
[16:02:23] simonstewart: Whatever uses locators/xpath.js
[16:02:58] jimevans: i'll give that a shot, but i thought i'd tried that, and was getting path issues when running with debug-server.

[16:11:13] simonstewart: First step: update the snapshot of closure library we're using
[16:11:51] eranm: jimevans, any idea on why there are three function wrappers for every script executed in the IE driver?
[16:12:28] jimevans: eranm: because i'm an idiot?
[16:13:05] jimevans: that should be your default answer to any question of the form "why is (x) like this in the IE driver?"
[16:13:26] eranm: I would equally accept an explanation that IE would like exactly 3 function wrappers. Not 2 and 4 is out of the question.
[16:14:44] simonstewart: Be nice to yourself jimevans
[16:14:51] simonstewart: We think that you're awesome :)
[16:16:09] jimevans: eranm: of course, it also kinda depends on what you mean by "every script executed". do you mean "any atom", "any script executed by the executeScript() language binding api", or "any script executed by the Script object in the driver itself"?
[16:17:25] jimevans: simonstewart: i'm not being overly hard on myself. there really is code in there that i can't really explain why i'm doing it the way i'm doing it. :)
[16:17:46] eranm: jimevans, the latter
[16:22:31] jimevans: eranm: well, the Script object itself doesn't do anything to munge the script source passed into it, unless i'm misreading the code. calling executeScript() from the language bindings *should* only give you two function wrappers.

[19:17:18] chrisculver701: ok thanks
[19:18:10] jimevans: jleyba: so here's what i want to do. i want to start using wicked-good-xpath in the IE driver. so the findElement atom has to know about it. i've placed the wgxpath source in third_party/js/wgxpath, added a build.desc so crazy-fun knows about it, and added the dependencies to the build.desc in javascript/atoms.
[19:19:31] jimevans: when i try to run 'go debug-server' to test my atoms changes, the atoms never see the stuff in the wgxpath directory. it's like the dependencies aren't getting calculated properly.
[19:20:06] jleyba: jimevans: define a js_library for wgxpath
[19:20:17] jimevans: yep. that's part of the build.desc for wgxpath.
[19:20:51] jleyba: add //third_party/js/wgxpath:$lib as a dep on //javascript/atoms:all_js
[19:21:43] jimevans: jleyba: already got that. and on //javascript/atoms:deps too
[19:22:20] jleyba: Ignore the js_deps rules - they have weird behavior :)
[19:22:39] jimevans: fair enough.
[19:22:40] jleyba: (I have a mental TODO to kill them all)
[19:23:24] jleyba: in javascript/webdriver/atoms/build.desc update the js_fragment rules to depend on atoms:all_js instead of atoms:deps
[19:23:41] jimevans: aha!
[19:23:42] jleyba: From there, the build *should* just work
[19:24:08] jleyba: Have you pulled in wgxpath's raw source or compiled form?  we want the raw source with closure annotations so the compiler can do its magic
[19:24:17] jimevans: raw source.
[19:24:23] jimevans: for exactly that reason
[19:26:03] jleyba: jimevans: What path does the IEDriverServer listen on? / or /wd/hub?
[19:26:07] jimevans: jleyba: how do i handle the js_fragment rules that depend on :deps?
[19:26:13] jimevans: it listens on /
[19:26:55] jleyba: Does it only accept connections from localhost?
[19:27:10] jimevans: yes. only localhost.
[19:27:15] jimevans: for now
[19:27:25] jleyba: Awww.. I don't want to go through the java server

[19:28:06] jimevans: doesn't/didn't chromedriver.exe have the same restriction?
[19:28:31] jleyba: At one point it didn't.  Don't know if that's still the case
[19:28:58] jleyba: Ok, I've got a test that is calling driver.quit()
[19:29:21] jleyba: And the java server keeps returning a UnsupportedCommandException
[19:29:41] jimevans: that's… odd
[19:29:55] jleyba: I suspect it's b/c the page under test has a hanging GET, but I'm having a hell of a time proving that
[19:35:14] jimevans: jleyba: yeah, so i run "go debug-server", and attempt to run locator_test.html, and i get "Undefined nameToPath for wgxpath" in the browser console
[19:35:29] jleyba: jimevans: That's something else

[19:36:18] jleyba: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/Rakefile#498

[20:01:28] jimevans: the debug server may not be seeing that directory as one it should serve up.
[20:02:57] jimevans: ah. i see the problem.
[20:03:52] jimevans: can't put the thing in third_party/js, because the rake task modifies deps.js looking specifically for paths with "js"
[20:12:20] jimevans: no, i'm wrong about that. is calcdepscalculating the path relative to third_party/closure/goog?
[20:12:34] jleyba: Yes
[20:13:23] jimevans: ah. so when the deps.js gets moved into /javascript, and read by the debug server, it's looking in /js/wgxpath, instead of /third_party/js/wgxpath

[20:15:26] jleyba: 1 sec

[21:47:18] jleyba: jimevans: the js tests? or did you get it working in the IEDriver?
[21:47:25] jimevans: both!
[21:48:02] jimevans: sort of. i have some internals to work out making sure the right exception gets thrown, but in the main it works.
[21:48:19] Dude-X: nice
[21:49:26] jimevans: code deletion in the IE driver! \o/
[21:50:06] jimevans: (to be entirely truthful, we're adding a ton of JS code, but removing special-case code for xpath, so that's still a win!)
[21:51:12] jimevans: jleyba: so it looks like the safari driver calls the closure compiler with some stricter options than the rest of the project uses, and it doesn't like what it sees in the wicked-good-xpath library.
[21:52:53] jleyba: jimevans: Can you gist the warnings?
[21:53:42] jimevans: i may have done something wrong in my config. give me a second.
[21:54:10] jleyba: Looking at our internal copies, the SafariDriver is compiled with stricter settings than wgxpath, so there probably are some errors

[22:07:13] lukeis: people must willfully not read sometimes... or are really f*ing lazy
[22:07:16] jimevans: jleyba: when using the injectable atoms, is it possible to manually insert an element into the document's element cache?
[22:07:26] jleyba: yes
[22:07:46] jimevans: and have it assigned an ID, and all that jazz?
[22:08:10] jleyba: Are you wanting to call from the outside, to preheat the cache with something?
[22:08:11] jimevans: handling javascript exceptions in IE is a bitch.
[22:08:15] jleyba: Or do this as part of another fragment?
[22:08:22] jimevans: so here's the scenario.
[22:09:05] jimevans: now that finding elements by xpath is in the atoms, even for javascript xpath engines, the only thing preventing the IE driver from switching to injectable atoms is finding by CSS selector.
[22:09:28] jimevans: the findElement atom won't work for css selectors if we have to fall back to sizzle.
[22:10:05] jimevans: so i need a way to fall back to sizzle if necessary, and pushing the resulting elements into the cache that the injectable atoms knows about.
[22:10:42] jleyba: define a custom fragment
[22:11:07] jleyba: to add something to the cache:   bot.inject.cache.add(document.body)
[22:11:35] jleyba: you could also define a custom findElement(s) atom for the IE driver that includes sizzle.
[22:11:58] jimevans: i think the closure compiler has issues with sizzle.
[22:12:05] jleyba: Ah
[22:12:23] jleyba: so you'll branch in the IEDriver?
[22:12:30] jimevans: that was my plan
[22:12:41] jleyba: if (css) { useSizzle } else { useAtoms }?
[22:13:24] ignacio_ has joined #selenium
[22:13:30] jimevans: more like if (!document.querySelector) { useSizzle } else { useAtoms }, but yeah.
[22:14:32] jleyba: yeah, so create an atom out of bot.inject.cache.addElement
[22:15:36] jleyba: call that for each element found by sizzle and you'll get back a string ID
[22:17:10] *jimevans nods
[22:17:52] jimevans: really more than i wanted to bite off today, but i'm in the weeds with it now.
[22:18:19] jleyba: jimevans: how about this
[22:18:35] jleyba: in the IEDriverServer, if locator strategy === "css selector", inject sizzle
[22:18:44] jleyba: that will define querySelector on the document
[22:19:00] jleyba: then just use the standard findElement atom
[22:19:45] jimevans: oh, no, that's not my problem. my problem right now is that the findElement atom throws for invalid paths.
[22:19:45] jleyba: (or do it in one injection with SIZZLE + FIND_ELEMENT)
[22:19:54] jleyba: ooooh
[22:20:20] jimevans: and i have no way to distinguish between a thrown exception because of invalid xpath, and a general error because of bad javascript.
[22:20:34] Ardesco has joined #selenium
[22:20:45] jimevans: because handling javascript exceptions in IE via c++ sucks.
[22:21:02] jleyba: try { findElement(); } catch (ex) { bot.response.createErrorResponse(ex); }
[22:21:35] jleyba: bot.response.createErrorResponse returns a wire-protocol friendly JSON object with status and value fields
[22:23:01] jimevans: yeah, that'd work. just need to decide where to add that little bit of goodness.
[22:24:38] jleyba: try { return bot.response.createResponse(findElement()); } catch (ex) { return bot.response.createErrorResponse(ex); }
[22:25:06] jleyba: with that you'll always end up with a {status: #, value: *} JSON object
[22:25:07] jimevans: yeah. i'll have to create a custom atom. 
[22:26:14] jimevans: because everything is compiled down into the C++ header file.

[22:28:17] jimevans: i can work around it without all these gyrations for now.
[22:28:45] jimevans: switching to the injectables can wait.
[22:31:00] jimevans: because if the findElement atom doesn't find an element, it doesn't throw, just returns a null.
[22:31:40] jleyba: can't you handle that on the C side?

[23:03:48] jimevans: just saw your last reply to the dev list. you shoulda pinged me! did you happen to notice the domain the guy was emailing from?
[23:04:32] lukeis: he emailed from gmail... he referenced a M$ address, yes
[23:05:12] lukeis: feel free to court him ;)
[23:05:23] jimevans: already on it. :)

[23:06:18] lukeis: M$ is a big land... so anyone with that address doesn't necessarily spark my interest :)
[23:06:41] lukeis: if he'd mentioned anything about IE... maybe I woulda pinged ya ;)
[23:06:51] jimevans: it is a big world, but that email address is an FTE (not contractor or vendor) address. 
[23:07:54] jimevans: and knowing the challenges i've had getting *anyone* inside the death star to respond, i am grateful for any inside interest.
[23:09:18] *lukeis thinks jimevans should go back to the mothership just to be an insider again to help with Se ;)
[23:11:28] jimevans: lukeis: i'm thinking this guy's the real deal. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301312.aspx
[23:13:03] lukeis: jimevans: cool... at least looks like he could seriously contribute ;)
