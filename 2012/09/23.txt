[13:51:00] rodrigues2k: Hey everyone, what`s faster: xxpath or cssSelector? when I can`t get by id, name, etc etc 
[13:51:28] adamgoucher: it depends
[13:51:55] adamgoucher: largely on what version of which browser, and how evil your xpath and/or css is
[13:52:20] adamgoucher: the rule of thumb is though; use css unless you have to use xpath
[13:58:37] rodrigues2k: thanks adam.

[14:17:51] andreastt: rodrigues2k: CSS selectors are typically highly performance tuned in browsers.  XPath is hardly tested.
[14:19:08] biceps: what is version of browser (mostly interest about mozilla Firefox) better to use ?
[14:38:37] andreastt: Better?
[14:38:48] andreastt: By what metric?

[15:08:46] biceps: I think more stable couple where work all features.
[15:12:34] biceps: for me now firefox 11 + selenium-2.20.0(python webdriver) more perfectly because in selenium 2.25.0 I can't use file field to upload file, or for example  when I tried to use selenium 2.21-25 and mozilla 12-14  each combination has problem with filefield
