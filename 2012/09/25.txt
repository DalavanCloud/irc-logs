[08:17:50] Sgeo_ has joined #selenium
[08:18:33] Sgeo_: Google Chrome's development tools can tell me what resources are being downloaded for a page, even if it's actually a plugin grabbing those resources. Can Selenium tap into that somehow?
[08:18:43] andreastt: No.
[08:18:53] andreastt: But you can use their protocol.
[08:19:18] andreastt: http://www.webkit.org/blog/1875/announcing-remote-debugging-protocol-v1-0/
[08:19:39] Sgeo_: Hmm, ok.
[08:19:56] andreastt: There might be client libraries for that.
[08:24:56] barancev: Sgeo_: look at browsermob-proxy
[08:26:25] Sgeo_: Not sure if this is easier or trying to parse the files that the plugin reads would be easier
[08:43:34] *Sgeo_ should possibly attempt better approaches to the problem

[11:38:55] barancev: jimevans: hi! I have no idea how Build.java can have any side-effect on javascript tests. this class builds selenium when you run a test from an IDE (it calls 'go' as an external process before running tests)
[11:39:20] jimevans: barancev: yeah, i don't get it either.
[11:40:04] barancev: there should be something else that changed too
[11:41:29] jimevans: i would think.
[11:42:06] jimevans: but that's the change set that had increased failures in the IE6 javascript tests on the CI server.
[11:42:25] adamgouchertoo has joined #selenium

[11:49:16] barancev: do we need dependency on IEDriverServer to run JS tests?
[11:52:17] jimevans: barancev: well, the browser has to be launched *somehow*, doesn't it?
[11:53:33] barancev: a launcher, ok. so wee have to add a dependency. crazyfun profi around?

[16:18:04] Dude-X: question to you guys: are stock options valuable if you leave the company you're working for?
[16:18:38] jimevans: Dude-X: not generally. you usually have some period of time to exercise them (like 30-90 days), then they expire.
[16:19:34] Dude-X: for a company that's not public, say they give you 1000 shares
[16:19:40] Dude-X: how is it valued?
[16:19:56] jimevans: well, are they options or are they shares?
[16:20:01] jimevans: there's a big difference.
[16:20:25] jimevans: if they're options, you typically still have to exercise them.
[16:20:40] Dude-X: they're just options
[16:20:41] jimevans: that is to say that you need to buy the shares at whatever price the option is
[16:20:53] jimevans: i'll give you a concrete example.
[16:21:06] jimevans: at my last employer, i was offered stock options.
[16:21:12] Dude-X: I was suppose to get options at my current company, but they got bought by news corp, so I got 0.
[16:21:12] jimevans: at the time it was a privately held company.
[16:22:51] jimevans: let's say my option (or "strike") price for those options was $0.10, so if i wanted to exercise 1000 shares, i wrote the company a check for $100, and they issued me a stock certificate for 1000 shares.
[16:23:21] jimevans: those shares were then mine. period. couldn't be revoked.
[16:23:29] RossPatterson: A stock option is the right to buy a specified number of shares of stock at a specified price, usually for a specified period of time.  Options usually have a "vesting period", prior to which they must be returned to the company, and an "excercise period", during which you can turn some or all of the options into stock.
[16:23:51] RossPatterson: Shares bought via options may be restricted or unrestricted.
[16:24:02] jimevans: they were no longer "options"; i'd exercised my right to buy the shares offered.
[16:24:13] RossPatterson: Restricted shares may have to be sold back to the company at a specified price under certain circumstances.
[16:24:37] RossPatterson: For example, a private company can require you to sell back shares when you quit.
[16:25:16] RossPatterson: Or they can require a "right of first refusal" before you sell them to anyone else.
[16:26:07] Dude-X: what's a typical number options offered
[16:26:12] RossPatterson: An "non-qualified option stock option" (NSO) contract can have all sorts of restrictions in it, basically anything you and your employer agree on.
[16:26:23] jimevans: Dude-X: no way to answer that question meaningfully.
[16:26:31] Dude-X: today the CEO of the company is going to call me to make an offer
[16:26:37] RossPatterson: Numbers of options are meaningless - it's all about what % of the total shares you get options on.
[16:27:03] Dude-X: and my general feeling of options is that they're kind of worthless if you don't know how successful a company is going to be
[16:27:10] RossPatterson: I got 10,000 options upon taking this job.  It's a small fraction of 1% of the company.
[16:27:12] jimevans: well, sort of.
[16:27:28] Dude-X: RossPatterson: is it a large corp or a startup
[16:27:35] RossPatterson: True.  But if you think the company will succeed, it can be a win.
[16:28:00] RossPatterson: Neither.  Parature is a 10-ish-year-old private company.  It has hopes of either going public or selling to a large company some day.
[16:28:39] Dude-X: So things look pretty good then that they've been around for 10 years
[16:29:10] RossPatterson: Things are different in a public company.  There, you can sell shares on the open market as soon as you buy them.  In a private company, there's no open market.
[16:29:22] Dude-X: right, that much is understood
[16:29:51] Dude-X: so when options is offered as a compensation package, it's the percentage that could be a useful metric?
[16:29:53] RossPatterson: We've had our ups and downs.  If we'd done better, we'd have hit the exit point long ago.  Right now, we're in good shape.
[16:30:03] RossPatterson: Yes.
[16:30:43] Dude-X: See that i didn't know.
[16:30:49] RossPatterson: But don't expect much of a % unless you're taking a Big Title job.  As CTO of another company, I got 25%.  Which ended up being worth $0.00 :-)
[16:31:23] RossPatterson: (Actually, I lost many thousands of dollars at that job :-( )
[16:31:31] Dude-X: :(

[16:34:19] KaibutsuX: jesus
[16:34:23] KaibutsuX: I wish I could ask for that much
[16:34:25] RossPatterson: Dude-X: What's the position?
[16:34:43] Dude-X: I'll their first test engineer and QA
[16:34:52] Dude-X: doing Webdriver and API testing
[16:36:40] stephend has joined #selenium
[16:36:59] RossPatterson: If the company is funded by venture capitalists, he'll try to get you for lower $ and offer you more options.  VCs like to see their companies being careful with their cash, and they like to see employees chasing the wealth-carrot dangling in front of them.
[16:38:19] Dude-X: The Director of Engineering and the headhunter feel confident that I can probably get 6 figures
[16:38:23] Dude-X: so to me that's a good sign
[16:38:34] RossPatterson: If the company is funded at a lower level, he'll try HARD to get you for lower $ and might offer even more options.  Companies without good investment backing are never sure where their next $1M is coming from, and options are an easy alternative - if the company wins big, you do too, if the company fails big, they cost nothing.
[16:38:42] RossPatterson: I'd agree.
[16:38:49] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: dont say yes to the first figure they give you... thats my only advice :)
[16:38:57] RossPatterson: Remember, though, the headhunter works for them.
[16:39:14] RossPatterson: And he's getting 18-20% of your salary as a finder's fee.
[16:39:51] Dude-X: but isn't it in his interest to get me the highest salary. I specifically told the headhunter that anything below 100K is not worth my time
[16:40:20] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: its a game to them...
[16:40:30] AutomatedTester: headhunter is a nice name for pimp
[16:40:56] RossPatterson: AutomatedTester: Also, when someone starts the salary discussion with "What are you looking for?", don't give them the number you want to end at.  If you answer at all, you're establishing the maximum and they'll either give it to you or negotiate down from there.
[16:41:11] RossPatterson: I try never to answer that question with a number.
[16:41:29] AutomatedTester: the difference in money to him for you getting 95k to getting 100k is neglible
[16:42:00] RossPatterson: Instead I say something like "Well, do you have a budget number you're working with?" and leave it in their hands to answer *me*.
[16:42:44] Dude-X: so what if they say a lowball budget like 85-95K
[16:42:58] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: do you currently have a job?
[16:43:02] RossPatterson: Comission on $5K is ~$1K.  Chump change, especially if the headhunter wants to get more business from the company.
[16:43:03] Dude-X: yes
[16:43:19] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: if they low ball you, walk away
[16:43:32] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: but be nice about it
[16:43:52] RossPatterson: If someone offered me $15K less than my bottom figure, I'd tell them that was what they'd done, and try to help them understand why I'm worth what I expect.
[16:44:06] RossPatterson: If I can't do that, I'm probably not going to be happy at that job.
[16:44:23] RossPatterson: Now, I HAVE taken those jobs.  But only when I was unemployed.
[16:44:43] Dude-X: Yeahâ€¦ unemployment is a stick they can beat you with
[16:44:52] Dude-X: at my current job i asked for 2000 dollars more
[16:45:05] AutomatedTester: "I am sorry but I was expecting more. I like your company but I feel that would undervalue my expertise in the long term and I am not ready to do that. If you want to discuss a higher figure with me then we can. There is no rush on getting back to me."
[16:45:06] RossPatterson: I prefer to see it as home much another month of job search costs me :-)
[16:45:13] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: Say something like ^
[16:45:16] RossPatterson: Yeah, good answer.
[16:46:01] AutomatedTester: right, need to get The Boy his supper
[16:46:02] AutomatedTester: bbl
[16:46:36] Dude-X: the HR guy said that coming from unemployment you should be happy with the offer and the budget they have is pretty restricted
[16:46:49] Dude-X: I was going to have him fight for another 2000 but then i reconsidered and said i'll take the job
[16:46:55] Dude-X: it worked out okay for me
[16:47:02] RossPatterson: Dude-X: A headhunter doesn't work for you, but he also doesn't want to waste his and  the company's time.  He's going to want to get a deal that makes all three of you at least reasonbly content.  If you told him your bottom number, and he kept going, he's going to try to get you something you'll accept.
[16:47:07] Dude-X: except for not getting stock options
[16:50:08] RossPatterson: On the kind of deal you're talking about, $2K is just over one week's salary.  I'd never walk away for that, especially if I didn't have a job already.
[16:50:11] Dude-X: a salary of 100K makes me the 6%
[16:50:16] RossPatterson: :-)
[16:51:06] Dude-X: thought the real 1% is really .01%

[16:55:32] RossPatterson: At every job, you're involved in a negotiation over Value and Cost.  Good employers want to get a reasonable balance between the two.  Bad employers want the highest value they can get for the lowest cost.
[16:55:39] Dude-X: I also live in NYCâ€¦. and even if my company gives me a raise to about 85K, the extra money while helpful doesn't help me close the savings deficit i have
[16:55:57] RossPatterson: Ooh, NYC.  Tough market, tough economy.
[16:56:04] RossPatterson: Lots of expensive geeks, though :-)
[16:56:24] *RossPatterson is an old City boy.
[16:56:33] Dude-X: 85K is not too shabby in NYC
[16:56:41] Dude-X: 100K however is excellent
[16:56:43] RossPatterson: Agreed.

[19:05:47] barancev: jimevans: it is real bad thing if js tests require iedriverserver?
[19:06:13] barancev: we have a prebuilt version of it that it always available
[19:07:17] jimevans: maybe so, but requiring //cpp:ie_win32_exe isn't the way to do that. it'll try to build the server, which won't work unless you have visual studio.
[19:08:46] barancev: no, it makes a copy of the prebuilt
[19:09:04] jimevans: you're right. i'm trying to do three things at once, and doing none of them particularly well.
[19:09:21] jimevans: nevertheless, your change broke everything; reverting it fixes it all.

[19:50:45] AutomatedTester: thats how we do it at Mozilla
[19:51:02] Dude-X: hey AutomatedTester, do the page objects keep track of what page they're on? it's something i am thinking of implementing in the future

[19:56:11] AutomatedTester: diminoten: I havent created a python equivalent
[19:56:24] Dude-X: you don't always need it;  it's to keep track of where you're coming from if you have that kind of web app where a widget or component can connect to many different outcomes
[19:56:42] diminoten: just a time related thing or are there implications in python that weren't there in java
[19:57:09] Dude-X: python is more flexible to do things in ad hoc way so there's little pressing need to duplicate everything java does
[19:57:16] diminoten: that's fair

[21:26:59] detronizator: events that are supposed to fire (javascriptWindowObjectCleared) are not firing
[21:27:07] detronizator: not firing everytime they should
[21:27:36] detronizator: jimevans: the issue become: the "currentFrame" is not reset to "mainFrame" when you load a page clicking on a link in a frame
[21:27:58] detronizator: this means that after that we are in an inconsistent state
[21:28:12] jimevans: aha.
[21:28:19] detronizator: and our "javascriptExecute" is stuck on a ghost frame

[23:08:23] caseyjb: you can pass in a log-file and log-level to IEDriverServer. If you set log-level to TRACE, you'll get more info than you ever wanted on exactly what goes to IE
