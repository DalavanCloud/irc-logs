[11:00:41] simonstewart: That's not hanging

[11:00:51] simonstewart: That's just taking a minute to figure out what's going on
[11:01:00] dawagner: Aah yes, it's continued
[11:01:08] simonstewart: After slightly over 60s
[11:01:09] dawagner: How the hell do we have a test which just pauses for 45 seconds?
[11:01:13] simonstewart: Technically, that test is failing
[11:01:23] simonstewart: It sets the timeout to something small, then runs
[11:01:46] dawagner: Four failures
[11:01:55] simonstewart: Which tests?
[11:01:55] dawagner: testSelectWindowTitle - cannot access dead object
[11:02:02] simonstewart: With Firefox 15?
[11:02:03] dawagner: testSelectPopUp - Command execution failure
[11:02:10] simonstewart: Right. Window related failures
[11:02:12] simonstewart: I see 'em too
[11:02:29] dawagner: testFramesOpen has a fail() called

[11:02:55] simonstewart: TestFramesOpen?
[11:03:12] simonstewart: Good
[11:03:16] simonstewart: Excellent. I see those too
[11:03:33] simonstewart: The problem seems to be that core is losing track of the current window and freaking out
[11:05:10] dawagner: jarib: What version of ruby/rubygems/etc do I want on Ubuntu?
[11:07:05] dekroning: simonstewart: got a question about style of writing Page Objects, I'm currently checking out SitePrism,it's a ruby gem, which is a thin wrapper for page objects, but I noticed that for example to login, you do smoething like:   @login_page.email_field.set "foo@bar.com"    @login_page.password_field.set "secret"    @login_page.submit_button.click    In selenium examples I more often see something like:  @login_page.login("foo@bar.com", "secret")
[11:07:26] dekroning: I was wondering what your thought are about the two ways
[11:07:29] simonstewart: The selenium examples are what I'd do
[11:07:45] simonstewart: Page Objects describe the services they offer to users in their API
[11:08:00] simonstewart: How that service is implemented is (by definition) an implementation detail
[11:08:12] simonstewart: page.loginAs(user) would be the ideal

[11:36:01] testingb0t: lucabox: detronizator: I posted this bug in the issue-tracker 2 months ago: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4336
[11:42:00] detronizator: testingb0t: very surprising no one of the main devs has fixed since. It's an easy fix and the issue is quite evident.
[11:42:08] lucabox: @testingb0t: ok thanks, for the pointer! weird that we are the only one falling on this issue. as far as I can see there is no way to make IE ignore certificates errors, with chrome and ff it looks we are ok
[11:42:33] simonstewart: detronizator: apparently we've not come across a failure yet
[11:43:09] simonstewart: So we probably want the certificate to start a day in the past, right?
[11:43:16] detronizator: simonstewart: the patch that testingb0t has provided does exactly the trick - could you guys merge that in (if not done already)
[11:43:39] simonstewart: I was thinking: Date begin = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() - TimeUnit.DAYS.toMillis(1));
[11:43:40] detronizator: yes: it's the double negative that doesn't work
[11:43:45] lucabox: @simonstewart yes, that patch corrects this bug
[11:43:45] simonstewart: Which is clearer than adding -1 days
[11:43:56] detronizator: simonstewart: fine for me!

[14:33:45] ShishKabab: Hi! I'm trying out unit testing with Selenium and Django for the first time. There's some kind of error happening, but the browser closes before I can see what's going on. Any tips to make Selenium pause until I close the browser window if there's an error?
[14:39:35] RossPatterson: How are you running your tests?
[14:45:20] funcman has joined #selenium
[14:47:26] ShishKabab: RossPatterson: I already found the solution. I'm using Django's LiveServerTestCase with nose, so I can use the --pdb switch to automatically drop into pdb if there's an error :)
[14:47:44] AutomatedTester: ShishKabab: or you can use -s
[14:48:48] AutomatedTester: bbiab
[14:48:52] nhirata has joined #selenium
[14:50:14] ShishKabab: AutomatedTester: -s only disabled output capturing, doesn't it? Selenium raised an exception about an element that it could not find, which was not too useful because there was something else going on (bad redirect).
[14:51:05] AutomatedTester: ShishKabab: if you have done pdb.set_trace() and run with -s nose wont try take control of inputs
[14:51:14] AutomatedTester: ShishKabab: but if --pdb works then awesome
[14:51:53] ShishKabab: AutomatedTester: :) I'll remember that. Thanks!

[15:34:07] Ardesco: doesn't work on osx
[15:34:20] andreastt: Is there a bug on that?
[15:34:30] Ardesco: so far i've tried actions and javascript, but you can't trigger css psudeo events it would seem
[15:34:40] andreastt: new Actions(driver).moveToElement(el).perform(); would be the usual approach.
[15:34:41] Ardesco: osx native event support isn't done yet as far as i'm aware
[15:34:54] Ardesco: hence it uses javascript to fake it
[15:34:55] andreastt: Depends which browser/config you're using.
[15:34:58] andreastt: Works fine in Opera.
[15:35:02] Ardesco: and javascript can't trigger a :hover event
