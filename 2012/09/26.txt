[15:10:46] jimevans: barancev: that fix was not related to the large breakage of tests.
[15:10:57] dawagner: :note santiycr the sort-order of scout browsers is a bit weird...
[15:10:57] selbot2_: ok!
[15:11:39] jimevans: the locator tests started failing when i introduced wgxpath into the atoms.
[15:12:08] barancev: jimevans: I thought IE6 java test failures are related to xpath locators that was fixed by your commit, no?
[15:13:01] jimevans: no. my fix is directly targeted to bad xpath, or xpath error conditions. successful finding by xpath has never been broken for IE6.
[15:13:09] jimevans: oh, you mean jaba.
[15:13:14] jimevans: java, not atoms tests.
[15:13:39] jimevans: yes, that should fix the java test failures for IE6, when i re-gen the IEDriverServer
[15:13:50] barancev: aha, I see
[15:14:33] jimevans: i'm specifically talking about the javascript atoms tests, which ballooned from 2 failures to 12, on a change that shouldn't have effected them at all.

[17:45:09] dawagner: rgr: That message indicates the element you're trying to send a file to is off screen (more than 3000 pixels off screen, in fact!)
[17:47:21] rgr: why it works in Firefox?
[17:47:50] dawagner: It probably shouldn't :)
[17:51:30] rgr: How would you do an upload script in Webdriver?
[17:52:05] rgr: something like this? driver.findElement(By.linkText("upload logo")).click();
[17:52:05] rgr: 		driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input[type=\"file\"]")).sendKeys("/home/rgr/Desktop/IMGS/Fx4Launch.png");
[17:52:11] dawagner: Interact with an upload element which is actually on the screen
[17:52:19] dawagner: Pretty much
[17:52:25] dawagner: But the input needs to be on screen
[17:52:33] rgr: yes, it is.
[17:52:37] dawagner: If that's tricky, you can execute some javascript to move it on screen
[17:52:51] dawagner: It's possible that there are multiple file inputs, and you're getting the wrong one
[17:53:00] rgr: it works in Mozilla, but not in Chrome driver (last version)
[17:53:11] rgr: no, just one file input
[17:54:04] dawagner: What happens if you get its location on screen?
[17:54:48] rgr: I get the locator by cssSelector... I don't get the screen coordinates
[17:55:04] barancev: rgr: can you share a link to the page with this element?
[17:58:03] rgr: It's just a piece of code that makes an upload... like this: 	<br/>
[17:58:03] rgr: 	File
[17:58:03] rgr: 	<input type="file" name="file"/>
[17:58:03] rgr: 	<br/>
[17:58:03] rgr: 		<input type="submit"/>
[17:58:03] rgr: 	</form>
[17:58:05] rgr:   </body>
[17:58:07] rgr: </html>
[17:58:30] rgr: using Chrome Driver, the upload doesn't work

[18:08:43] jarib: davidko: not that i know python, but where would it get 'latin-1' from? why does it think the string is latin-1?
[18:10:12] davidko: is_local_file calls  if os.path.exists(file_path):
[18:10:13] barancev: encoding issue? your python can't cope with UTF-8 char
[18:10:26] davidko: and os is a built in python library

[18:18:38] davidko: i'll try that

[21:40:53] jimevans: and we're down to a single failure for them now, this failure in drag_test.html.
[21:41:08] jimevans: if you look at that revision, the reason it's failing on IE6...
[21:41:32] dawagner: HA!
[21:41:34] jimevans: is that a specific skip of the test *for* *IE6* was removed in that revision 
[21:41:48] jimevans: dawagner looked at the code. :)
[21:42:40] jimevans: i strongly suspect that an IE6 bug is at least partially at fault. the page doesn't render properly in IE6.

[22:05:23] jimevans: that's exactly what the ghostdriver project is all about.
[22:05:47] jimevans: it's a webdriver interface to phantomjs, which is a headless webkit implementation.
[22:06:10] goddard: is it working?

[22:06:20] goddard: sounds like what im looking for
[22:06:42] dawagner: AHA!
[22:07:10] jimevans: goddard: there's a (private) .NET binding for it checked into the project, and you can certainly use the java RemoteWebDriver to execute it, but there are a few bugs in the project we're still working on.

[22:09:53] jimevans: goddard: i've been able to run the .NET bindings' tests against the latest ghostdriver code with a pass rate of about 85%, so the project is coming along. i think detronizator may have found the root cause of some crashes we were seeing, and may have a fix soon-ish too, which will increase that percentage.

[22:11:47] detronizator: not fully ready yet
[22:12:17] jimevans: no rush. when it's ready.
[22:12:35] jimevans: i assume the issues you're finding are down in the webkit code?
[22:12:35] detronizator: I'm also dealing with some "resistence" from Ariya, as I want to change an API that confuses people to behave differently
[22:12:48] jimevans: yeah, i've been following that discussion on the mailing list.
[22:12:49] detronizator: and that caused issues in GhostDriver as well (I WAS CONFUSED TOO!)
[22:13:35] jimevans: dawagner: does the sauce IE6 image need a browser update maybe? because that doesn't crash for me locally on IE6.
