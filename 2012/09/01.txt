[07:20:24] lukeis: :note dawagner check it out ;) http://lukeis-sehq.appspot.com/   had to change all html files to jsp (cause app engine wouldn't let me use servlet mapping to say .html should be processed as jsp)... I have it deploying with maven too :) let's get this setup in jenkins and then figure out dns / urls (I'll wait till we talk again before checking it in)
[07:20:24] selbot2: ok!
[07:36:09] slavka`1: hey guys... just trying to understand this selenium grid thing... i noticed one of the first instruction is to go to selenium distribution and type ant launch-hub... is all this really doing is starting selenium server?
