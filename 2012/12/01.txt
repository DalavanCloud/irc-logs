[17:22:07] Ajay_: adamgoucher: how did the repackaging jars going  :-)
[17:22:30] adamgoucher: i got frustrated and went onto things i actually get paid to do
[17:23:20] adamgoucher: so, not especially well. :D
[17:23:57] jmathes_ has joined #selenium
[17:24:06] adamgoucher: i used a jar found on the internets that was already redone specifically for this reason and it just revealed more problems
[17:24:42] adamgoucher: i suspect it really would only take a weekend for someone with java / android chops to deal with
[17:25:11] Ajay_: krosenvold: had written for jetty repackaging 
[17:26:18] adamgoucher: i think the jetty stuff is more than just a repackage
[17:27:27] DaveIngram has joined #selenium
[17:27:52] Ajay_: yeah i wanted to upgrade htmlunit -> which depends on some latest jetty version , (we use some other version ) .... its tangled jars

[18:13:41] kallisti: is HTML 5 web storage still only supported on the iOS and Android platforms?
[18:14:06] Dude-X_: python bindings have it too
[18:14:15] Dude-X_: and i suppose java does too
[18:14:19] kallisti: right, it's in the protocol.
[18:14:27] kallisti: I'm talking about server-side
[18:14:31] Dude-X_: oh
[18:14:46] kallisti: I was told a while ago by (don't remember who) that web storage only worked on Android and iOS
[18:14:56] kallisti: that as Selenium 2.21
[18:14:59] kallisti: *was
[18:16:14] Dude-X_: we  are up to 2.26 now
[18:16:23] Dude-X_: next week 2.27 should be out

[18:55:37] Dude-X_: i think they have 
[18:55:51] Dude-X_: well they have always supported capabilities in some manner
[18:55:57] kallisti: er I mean
[18:55:58] kallisti: required
[18:55:59] kallisti: capabilities
[18:57:23] Dude-X_: in that case no
[18:57:41] kallisti: so then I still have a chance to be on the cutting edge of Selenium technology
[18:57:43] kallisti: excellent
[18:58:14] Dude-X_: could be wrong but it wold have stuck in my mind that that functionality has been added
[IRC logfile - Started Sat Dec  1 19:00:02 2012]
[19:00:02] kallisti: it'll be such a pain to implement in Haskell unfortunately.
[19:00:14] kallisti: at least in a way that I'm happy with
[19:02:52] kallisti: looks like there's some non-standard stuff in the Java server/client that's pending standardization
[19:03:07] kallisti: apparently an executeSql command. no idea what that means in this context.
[19:03:51] Dude-X_: probably for the upcoming webSql command
[19:03:57] Dude-X_: err standard
[19:04:26] Dude-X_: kallisti, i'm going to go out so; we'll talk later; good to see you after your long hiatus
[19:04:38] kallisti: I disappear occasionally. :P
[19:04:43] kallisti: bye.
[19:29:43] kallisti: question regarding the log system:  what is the "client" log type.
[19:30:08] kallisti: it just make any sense to me that the client would ask the server for client logs.

[20:52:23] kallisti: er, that wasn't my question though.
[20:52:41] kallisti: my question is if it works on other platforms now besides just iOS and Android.
[20:56:44] AutomatedTester: kallisti: works in all browsers
[20:56:51] AutomatedTester: well all the latest browsers
[20:57:01] AutomatedTester: I think IE >9
[20:57:48] kallisti: ah okay.
[20:57:57] *kallisti removes that caveat from his documentation

[20:58:16] AutomatedTester: look for Browser compatibility
