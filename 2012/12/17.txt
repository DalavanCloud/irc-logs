[00:50:59] sevensoft: so what exactly is the official scm location for grid?

[01:56:47] sevensoft: i see why that ThreadGuard exists.. but not sure why i would puke on a clean test like this (haven't dug into the tests at all yet)
[01:57:29] sevensoft: it was while running SmallTests
[01:57:29] sevensoft: Test org.openqa.selenium.support.SmallTests failed

[02:00:34] sevensoft: i'm pulling to build on my windows machine to see if i get different results.. i just suspect that there is some difference in the jvm on the mac and that most selenium devs might not be on osx.. (just a wild guess)

[16:07:38] dhpe: Hey, check out the screencast at http://usetrace.com - we've done a new kind of webdriver IDE - very powerful to create and maintain webdriver tests. Everything runs in a browser (no plugins needed), so one does not even need to install selenium or any browsers locally to use it fully.
[16:07:51] dhpe: Would love to hear your feedback.
[16:08:37] andreastt: Any reason why Opera isn't covered?

[16:12:10] dhpe: andreastt: it's coming. we're focused on making the test creation and maintenance as easy as possible - something no selenium cloud service has covered so far - and will be adding all the common browsers soon.
[16:12:34] sebbo has joined #selenium
[16:15:36] sebbo: hi, i have a problem with selecting an element by xpath. i try to select something by the value of an attribute and can't get it to work. my xpath is: "//div[starts-with(@id, 'menu-')]//a[starts-with(@id, 'menuitem-')]//span[contains(., 'Category')]"
[16:15:37] AutomatedTester: dhpe: so its a record and replay tool?
[16:16:36] dhpe: AutomatedTester: nope, we don't believe in recording.
[16:16:54] lukeis: sebbo: that's not 'value of an attribute' that's the text inside the span
[16:17:02] AutomatedTester: dhpe: ok so what is your USP?
[16:17:06] dhpe: actually that script in the example is a bad example, because that's derived from a recording script.
[16:17:32] dhpe: but the idea is that the scripts are written by hand, and it is augmented by interacting with the live browser on the right.
[16:17:35] sebbo: lukeis: true

[16:20:03] sebbo: lukeis: work-stuff. can't do that :( but i have some xpaths which work well in my browserplugin and don't work in selenium

[16:23:19] davehunt: dawagner: ping?
[16:24:43] dhpe: AutomatedTester: this is the first cross browser testing tool that requires absolutely no local installations. you can create, maintain and execute tests from the very same view.
[16:25:30] dhpe: and because we provide an IDE that's tightly integrated with the product under test, we can do powerful stuff to help in test development.
[16:25:50] AutomatedTester: so I create my test and upload it to your servers?
[16:26:46] dhpe: You create them inside Usetrace. You make a change in your test script, and you immediately get feedback because there is no "test deployment" phase. It is removed.
[16:27:06] danqa has joined #selenium

[16:27:28] dhpe: There's a code editor and a your product under test in the same view. And they are in interaction with one other.
[16:27:44] dhpe: one another*
[16:28:27] jimevans: dhpe: so if my product is internal (not publicly available on the internet), or i want to keep my test code in a source code control system, what are my options?
[16:29:16] RossPatterson: dhpe: Your website doesn't communicate that very well.  My first reaction was "meh, yet another record-and-replay tool".
[16:30:21] Phil___ has joined #selenium
[16:30:40] jimevans: (the lack of ability to test a non-released, non-public version of my app wouldn't necessarily be a deal-breaker for me; the lack of version control of my source code certainly would)
[16:31:33] lukeis: dhpe: hopefully you're not taking this criticism badly, usually we try to ask questions about new products like this, so you think about those questions and either answer them or solve them in some way in your product
[16:31:50] RossPatterson: Yeah, what luke said!

[16:32:35] dhpe: jimevans: for testing internal versions, we can provide ssh tunneling. if you want to host your code yourself, then we currently cannot help you. we're following how many will require this and then act accordingly.
[16:32:49] jimevans: dhpe: got it. thanks.
[16:32:50] davehunt: :seen dawagner
[16:32:50] selbot2_: dawagner was last seen about 5 hours ago, joining.
[16:32:53] dhpe: RossPatterson: thanks, it is true, we'll improve our message.
[16:34:34] dhpe: jimevans: one of our value props is to be able to run the test suite against any environment you've got. First against your _uncommitted_ environment on your local machine, then against your team's integration test server, and if suitable, even against production.
[16:35:52] dhpe: so if you've set-up your local selenium, you don't have time to wait for the whole suite to run before you commit. with usetrace, you make a change and you can execute the whole suite very fast in parallel before you even commit.

[16:36:10] Phil___: is anyone familiar with the following-sibling/preceding-sibling commands in xpath?
[16:37:18] RossPatterson: Phil____: Somewhat
[16:37:28] jimevans: dhpe: that's fine. like i said, i'd be far less likely to view that as a challenge than not having version control of my source code. automated tests are (or at least ought to be treated like) source code. if you wouldn't work on your application's source code without benefit of version control, you shouldn't do the same for your automated test code imo.
[16:38:08] jimevans: but take my opinion for what it's worth. i rarely know what i'm talking about.
[16:38:16] lukeis: dhpe: also i'd love to see mobile device support ;) 
[16:38:25] lukeis: don't listen to jim's self deprecation...
[16:38:33] dhpe: jimevans: we absolute agree that versioning is critical.
[16:38:33] *RossPatterson would disagree with jimevans on that point.
[16:38:48] RossPatterson: The "rarely" part.
[16:39:01] jimevans: RossPatterson: "never"? :D
[16:39:12] Phil___: @RossPatterson:  do you know if you run either of those commands on a node that fits the xpath criteria will that node be returned also in the results?
[16:39:18] RossPatterson: I was thinking more like "almost always" :-)
[16:39:26] jimevans: hah.
[16:39:29] lukeis: jimevans: s/rarely/think/  ;)
[16:39:36] dhpe: lukeis: supporting native mobile app testing is in our roadmap. we our first focus is on the web.
[16:39:49] lukeis: cool :)
[16:40:02] Phil___: i.e if you run (following-sibling::div | preceding-sibling::div)[@class='errorMessage'] on a node that has the class 'errorMessage' will that same node be ommitted in the results or included
[16:40:32] dhpe: can you guys look our screencast @ fullscreen? my friend said he cannot, but I can.
[16:40:49] RossPatterson: Phil___: No, it won't.  The xxx-sibling axes do just what they sound like - find nodes at the same level of the tree to the "left" and "right" of the node in question.
[16:41:03] Phil___: thanks, that'll be my issue then =)
[16:41:06] RossPatterson: dhpe: Yes, but it was almost unreadble - too blurry.
[16:41:08] sebbo: so, i have this xpath: "//div[starts-with(@id, 'roletoolbar-')]//input[@placeholder='Filter']" not working on this page: http://nerdground.de/SchalterVerwalter2.html

[16:52:47] AutomatedTester: dhpe: what languages are you supporting in your IDE? the videos like python
[16:53:21] lukeis: sebbo: ok, forgive me if I don't understand the iceweasel version numbering as it corresponds to firefox, but does that mean FF3.5?  if so, then that version of browser has been deprecated from selenium support… I tried your xpath with FF16 and it worked
[16:54:02] lukeis: i don't have 3.5 installed anywhere to check… I think i have 3.6 somewhere...
