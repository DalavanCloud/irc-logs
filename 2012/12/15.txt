[15:29:08] adamgoucher: censorzilla is btw, perhaps my favortie page on the internet
[15:29:19] AutomatedTester: its really funny
[15:29:47] AutomatedTester: I am on holiday now so after I finish my firefox os app I might grep the code base
[15:30:20] adamgoucher: its nowhere close to being like that now

[15:34:18] AutomatedTester: it looks like our repo is fairly tame
[15:34:37] adamgoucher: heh. and with that, i've killed your productivity for the next hour :)
[15:35:41] AutomatedTester: I did 4 searches and they didnt show much
[15:35:59] *AutomatedTester goes back to working on his firefox os app
[15:36:45] adamgoucher: now, instragram or tumblr's code might be more interesting
[15:37:27] AutomatedTester: or facebook
[15:37:44] AutomatedTester: nice, localStorage code working on first try
[15:38:03] *AutomatedTester still mutters there is a lot of boiler plate for localStorage
[15:38:15] AutomatedTester: but will remove things when I refactor
[15:47:44] detroniz_: mmm
[15:47:51] detroniz_: this is an interesting one
[15:48:09] detroniz_: Should, switching to a window, switch also to the Main Frame of that window?
[15:48:13] detroniz_: In general, yes.
[15:48:27] AutomatedTester: detroniz_: this is a question that barancev was asking the other day
[15:48:35] detroniz_: yep
[15:48:39] detroniz_: but there is an interesting twist
[15:48:45] detroniz_: imagine you have 1 window only
[15:48:48] detroniz_: and 1 frame in it
[15:48:51] AutomatedTester: detroniz_: Simon and I agree that it go to the the default content
[15:49:07] detroniz_: so, every switch to a window, even if you ar eALREADY in it
[15:49:11] barancev: detroniz_: yes, it goest to the topmost document
[15:49:13] detroniz_: should also force a switch to "default content"
[15:49:34] detroniz_: hence, implicitly it's switching back from any sub-frame to the main frame
[15:49:37] AutomatedTester: detroniz_: a switchToWindow should switch to it and window.top
[15:49:42] detroniz_: since to me like the best generalized behaviour
[15:49:46] barancev: a good question is -- what if you switch from a window to the same window
[15:49:59] detroniz_: barancev: that's EXACTLY the issue I have now
[15:50:04] AutomatedTester: barancev: it should act like switching a window
[15:50:09] detroniz_: barancev: https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/issues/129
[15:50:23] barancev: I don't know the answer, and I'm going to add a test :)
[15:50:25] AutomatedTester: or ignore the command since we can see we are on the same window
[15:50:48] detronizator: barancev: FF does switch to window.top on it's own, as well as resetting to the main frame
[15:50:59] detronizator: ghostdriver currently doesn't
[15:51:03] detronizator: and I'm about to change this :)
[15:51:40] detronizator: I do love this project... it's such a tricky thing this WebDriver business
[15:52:09] AutomatedTester: detronizator: yea, and this is why even being on github I dont think we would get a lot of patches
[15:52:24] AutomatedTester: but thats only my opinion
[15:52:46] *detronizator I'm going to let this pass as I have a thight deadline and David wants to fight :)
[15:52:52] detronizator: tight*
[15:53:01] AutomatedTester: i note with great sadness that github have removed the downloads section :(
[15:53:08] AutomatedTester: detronizator: it wasnt meant to be a troll
[15:54:19] detronizator: AutomatedTester: ah ok. I thought you wanted to tease me :) (trolling? no, not you!)
[15:54:28] detronizator: AutomatedTester: for the record, I disagree. 
[15:54:38] *detronizator damns himself because he couldn't resist
[15:54:45] AutomatedTester: when did google remove its "block this type of result" feature?
[15:54:59] barancev|2 has joined #selenium
[15:56:52] detronizator: AutomatedTester: it might have failed their A/B

[15:57:10] AutomatedTester: yea but I liked that feature

[16:17:58] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: ^

[16:21:55] AutomatedTester: santiycr: yt?
[16:22:59] santiycr: AutomatedTester:  yup
[16:23:01] jarib: you can switch your existing account to an open sauce acount
[16:23:12] AutomatedTester: jarib: oh, I never saw that
[16:23:18] jarib: just click "upgrade" in the menu while signed
[16:23:20] jarib: in
[16:24:10] AutomatedTester: santiycr: whats the "prefered" way for people to open opensauce accounts if they have an account already with Sauce?
