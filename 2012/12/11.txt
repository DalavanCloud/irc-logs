[00:00:24] AutomatedTester: detronizator: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/build.desc#136
[00:00:47] AutomatedTester: detronizator: I think that is the build job that combines all the jars
[00:01:19] detronizator: that seems to be the case. I just found the same file doing a full text search in sublime with "opera-driver"
[00:01:22] detronizator: I'll do that
[00:01:30] detronizator: and see if the resulting build contains the jar
[00:02:00] detronizator: what do we do if that's the case? 2.27.1 or do we just wait for another release in few months?
[00:02:22] detronizator: it sucks: people will not be able to pick selenium up and just use it out of the box
[00:02:35] detronizator: I mean, use phantomjs driver
[00:02:36] detronizator: out of the box
[00:02:37] detronizator: :(
[00:02:56] jcarr has left #selenium
[00:03:20] AutomatedTester: detronizator: a) people can't use it "out of the box" until the next version of phantomjs b) we can always expedite 2.28
[00:03:28] AutomatedTester: we used to do weekly releases
[00:03:40] AutomatedTester: releasing software is free
[00:03:52] detronizator: AutomatedTester: that's true and that's also true :)
[00:04:16] AutomatedTester: dont worry chicken little, the sky is not falling 
[00:04:17] AutomatedTester: :)
[00:04:28] detronizator: chicken little? lol
[00:04:40] AutomatedTester: :yt chicken little

[00:09:38] AutomatedTester: detronizator: laters :)
[00:09:49] AutomatedTester: detronizator: are you on the mailing list?
[00:09:54] detronizator: y
[00:10:12] detronizator: finding hard those days to do anything on selenium/ghostdriver
[00:10:24] AutomatedTester: because you/I can propose 2.28 and see if there are takers for that release
[00:10:25] detronizator: swamped by "sudden release" at Amazon
[00:10:47] *AutomatedTester is swamped with FirefoxOS work atm
[00:10:47] detronizator: I'll make sure how to have all in place before I "propose" such thing
[00:11:01] detronizator: I should get a bit more free time next week
[00:11:08] AutomatedTester: detronizator: propising doesnt mean you have to do it

[00:11:16] detronizator: AutomatedTester: of course
[00:11:42] AutomatedTester: detronizator: let me know if adding in a line for phantomjs works when you do ./go release
[00:11:48] AutomatedTester: and I will land the patch for you
[00:12:06] detronizator: I got the commit bit
[00:12:08] detronizator: I can do that :)

[00:44:10] AutomatedTester: jimevans: he probably wont believe us still
[00:44:15] jimevans: :D
[00:45:01] AutomatedTester: haters gonna hate
[00:45:11] AutomatedTester: :P
[00:45:41] jimevans: with the possible exception of svn, i definitely don't think of detronizator as a hater. :)
[00:46:24] detronizator: I actually saw you without knowing at which second to look
[00:47:15] AutomatedTester: detronizator: jimevans has the proof so you learn not to question
[00:47:32] detronizator: jimevans: and so, you had the opportunity to punch Clooney in the groins and you didn't?
[00:47:39] detronizator: that DOES make me a hater!
[00:47:41] detronizator: :P
[00:47:57] jimevans: um, no. several seasons after clooney left. :)
[00:48:18] jimevans: wish i had met him. he supposedly has a great sense of humor.
[00:48:18] detronizator: jimevans: ah - I don't follow that serial, so not sure when stuff happened
[00:48:36] detronizator: jimevans: still, his ads about Nespresso make me want to puke
[00:48:54] jimevans: a-ha. those aren't in the states.
[00:48:56] detronizator: he was good in his last hollywood movie though - pity he didn't get the oscar
[00:52:38] detronizator: AutomatedTester: jimevans: so, changing that extra build.desc does the trick
[00:52:53] jimevans: detronizator: so should I create crazy-fun build targets for running the standard webdriver tests with phantomjs?
[00:53:14] jimevans: (i've done the legwork already)
[00:53:14] detronizator: what does that require?
[00:53:34] detronizator: phantomjs 1.8 will go out on the 21st
[00:53:37] jimevans: needs a few additions to make the test framework aware of phantomjsdriver
[00:53:59] detronizator: I was looking at "rake-tasks/browsers.rb"
[00:54:10] detronizator: and seems like there is other config in there, but I'm unsure what they are for
[00:54:11] jimevans: yeah, don't look there. it's more involved than that.
[00:55:09] detronizator: jimevans: do we need a binary copy of phantomjs stable into the selenium repo?
[00:55:17] detronizator: or a specific build to put on the CI box?
[00:55:20] detronizator: or what?
[00:55:32] jimevans: i don't think so, and i'm not looking at adding it to CI yet.
[00:55:35] jimevans: we're not that far along.
[00:55:50] jimevans: first things first.
[00:56:01] jimevans: we need to be able to run a go target locally and get things passing.
[00:56:42] detronizator: so, what do you think I should do to help?
[00:56:43] jimevans: ./go //java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/phantomjs:test:run
[00:56:50] detronizator: or should I sit back and watch you do it? :)
[00:56:55] jimevans: that'd be the target, after this change.
[00:56:57] detronizator: so that I learn, that is
[00:57:04] detronizator: and you have that ready to go?
[00:57:09] jimevans: i don't think it'll be destructive, so i may just check it in.
[00:57:17] detronizator: you will get failures
[00:57:21] jimevans: what the hell, let's give it a shot.
[00:57:30] detronizator: you are the doctor!
[00:57:32] detronizator: :P
[00:57:44] jimevans: oh, i know. i want to get the target made, then let *you* debug the failures. :)
[00:58:01] detronizator: ah, so this is more of a "trap" than anything else
[00:58:03] detronizator: I see...
[00:58:05] detronizator: :)
[00:58:46] detronizator: fine for me, assuming it's ok I go to sleep now (for real this time)
[00:58:51] detronizator: and don't have to fix it now

[10:40:13] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: i dont think very

[10:40:36] Ardesco: :/
[10:40:56] AutomatedTester: I was a by-stander so dont know all the story
[10:41:20] AutomatedTester: but the equivalent is moving the core of python to python 3 instead of 2.6 
[10:41:40] AutomatedTester: danielwh: whats the chances of us shipping as JDK 7?
[10:41:47] andreastt: Ardesco: Most of our users use JDK 1.6.

[15:20:21] jarib: barancev: if it's the remote server/grid, webdriver.remote.sessionid is actually a returned capability
[15:20:47] jarib: barancev: if it's e.g. local firefox, i agree that you shouldn't necessarily care about the URL or sessionid, but the webdriverjs use case seems valid
[15:20:54] barancev: jarib: yes, one can get sessionId from capablity
[15:21:08] jarib: jleyba: around?
[15:21:34] barancev: jarib: "local" firefox is internally remote
[15:21:47] jarib: i know :)
[15:22:00] jarib: but it doesn't set the sessionid capability.

[16:47:27] dude-x: are there plans to make native events toggle-able for a driver?
[16:47:59] lukeis: usually native is better
[16:48:16] dude-x: but it's up to twice as slow
[16:48:17] lukeis: firefox is the only toggle-able one, via desired caps
[16:48:54] dude-x: you can enable native events when starting up a browser, but i don't start a new browser for every test
[16:49:10] lukeis: that's your problem ;)
[16:49:32] lukeis: if you look at the selenium tests there's an annotation for a 'fresh browser'
[16:50:01] dude-x: well, it's not to hard for me to set up a fixture in py.test for a native events enabled firefox
[16:50:25] dude-x: maybe it might be better to spend some time in figuring out why native events can be up to twice as slow

[17:15:35] gtailleb: hi
[17:15:57] gtailleb: i'm facing an issu with webdriver IE
[17:16:39] gtailleb: I'm using webdriver 2.25, remote standalone webdriver server, IEDriverServer.exe and IE9
[17:17:05] gtailleb: In my tests i set inputs quite often with values such as "feed1" or "test123". Occasionnally and randomly webdriver sets the value as "feed&" or "test1é3" or "test12"" replacing the numeric character by its shifted equivalent on the keyboard.
[17:17:12] lukeis has joined #selenium
[17:17:33] jimevans: gtailleb: is there any chance you're using the keyboard of the machine while you're running your test?
[17:17:43] gtailleb: amready posted this today on webdriver google group, but no answer so far, i thought maybe i would have more luck here
[17:17:44] davehunt has joined #selenium
[17:18:09] gtailleb: jimevans : nope i put my hands up in the air when running tests under IE
[17:18:36] jimevans: in your webdriver tests are you using WebElement.sendKeys() or the actions class to send your keystrokes?
[17:18:58] gtailleb: sendKeys
[17:19:29] jimevans: then i got nothing. i'll need to have a reproducible case to be able to help further.
[17:19:31] gtailleb: for instance i get this in my tests reports : value of 'input/text' web element is incorrect expected:<${page.params[[]'q']}> but was:<${page.params[(]'q']}>
[17:20:45] jimevans: i presume you're using native events? (if you aren't you'd have to have manually disabled them, so you'd probably know that)
[17:21:07] gtailleb: it's so random and occasional, i can't narrow the test case to a minimal and determinist case
[17:21:37] gtailleb: i'm not that aware about native events, i haven't used that
[17:22:01] sfbrian has joined #selenium
[17:22:02] jimevans: if you don't know anything about it, then you are using native events in IE.
[17:22:55] gtailleb: is webdriver 2.25 ie10 aware?
[17:24:21] jimevans: gtailleb: i can tell you that the keyboard code for IE using native events is just sending windows messages to the IE window. if something outside of webdriver is fussing with the keyboard state (be it manual keyboard use or another application), you can get unpredictable results like you're describing.
[17:24:34] jimevans: you should update the IEDriverServer.exe to 2.27.0 at least.
[17:25:43] jimevans: as of 2.27.0, the IEDriverServer.exe will run against IE10, so it's IE10-aware. it's not, however, windows 8-aware. i see failures in the webdriver test suite in our CI environment running on windows 8 that I don't see using the beta of IE10 on windows 7.

[17:29:53] stephend: nirvdrum: so we have a couple of tests that use requests w/selenium (yeah, we'll fix that and just go straight requests, in Python) to check all of the links on a given page
[17:30:10] stephend: nirvdrum: when one of these two problematic tests time out, we get a session time out on Grid, which is expected
[17:30:18] stephend: nirvdrum: but then we get a problem removing that session from Grid
[17:30:36] nirvdrum: Removing the node or the session?
[17:30:39] stephend: and eventually, a blank Firefox browser opens and doesn't run any WebDriver-passed coommands
[17:30:52] stephend: nirvdrum: SessionCleanup
[17:31:32] nirvdrum: The hub should see the timeout and clear out the session.
[17:31:49] stephend: we have a timeout through davehunt's plugin set to 180
[17:32:01] nirvdrum: The second window sounds like your client is retrying and the session got queued up, but then the client disconnected.
[17:32:17] nirvdrum: In that case, the hub schedules the request when it can, but there's no client to hand the session ID to, so it's orphaned.
[17:32:35] nirvdrum: It should get picked up by the orphan check.
[17:33:02] stephend: http://i.imgur.com/pYbxG.jpg
[17:33:32] stephend: (those warnings are our mobile devices trying to register -- we have them on a cron because they disconnect so often)

[17:33:50] stephend: the proxy-host ones, I mean
[17:34:42] nirvdrum: "Error releasing the resources . . ." seems bad.

[17:38:20] stephend: slow uploads are slow :-(

[17:51:45] sassda has joined #selenium
[17:52:04] dude-x: dawagner: has that always been true?
[17:52:45] dude-x: then i'd consider it a bug to enable native events on the mac
[17:53:02] dude-x: because it works differently from synthetic
[17:53:19] nerd has joined #selenium
[17:53:23] dawagner: Native events on Mac should just fall back to synthetic, there isn't anything else they can do?
[17:53:36] lukeis: dude-x: as long as I've known, mac native events for FF have not worked / been enabled
[17:54:04] dude-x: i see a difference in functionality in the python bindings so Ill bug AutomatedTester about it
[17:54:47] lukeis: python checks for Mac os and disables native events
[17:54:47] lukeis: if that's what you mean..
[17:55:23] dude-x: yes it does but if you go out of your to enable them...
[17:55:54] lukeis: it won't matter, becuase the xpi won't be able to load a library (i think)
[17:56:20] dude-x: i instantiate a FirefoxProfile, set NE to true, then instantiate a driver with the profile; no errors, everything opens up fine
[17:56:40] lukeis: yeah, but what does the capabilities say when you get the driver?
[17:57:59] lukeis: dude-x: and there's a catch in firefox/webdriver.py
[17:58:42] lukeis: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/webdriver.py#45
[17:58:49] dude-x: lukeis: how i can i query the driver what caps it has
[17:58:54] dawagner: dude-x: Yeah, it will open up fine, but it will fall back to synthetic events
[17:59:11] dude-x: then the fallback is wonky
[17:59:32] dawagner: As Simon always says, just beacuse you desired the capabilities, doesn't mean that they were actually provided.  (Which I still disagree with :))
[17:59:49] dawagner: AutomatedTester will ask you for a reduced test case showing what you mean by wonky :)

[18:00:28] jchauncey has joined #selenium
[18:00:35] jimevans: dawagner: i think that's why we added the whole "requiredCapabilities" bit, isn't it?
[18:00:43] dude-x: actionchain.move_to_element works fine with default values; setting NE enabled in the profile, then spawning a driver with that profile, actionchain.move_to_element does not work
[18:01:21] lukeis: dude-x: how do you start the driver? if you use "webdriver.Firefox" instead of remote it will ignore the profile setting
[18:02:08] simonstewart has joined #selenium
[18:02:18] dude-x: well i'm testing this via the shell, so i did p = FirefoxProfile(); p.enable_native_events = True; d = webdriver.Firefox℗;

[18:03:01] simonstewart: Bah! It's sunny and lovely
[18:03:07] simonstewart: And there are no mince pies

[18:03:13] dawagner: jimevans: It is, but I think that should be the only bit :)
[18:03:16] lukeis: ;)
[18:03:29] jimevans: dawagner: :)
[18:03:50] simonstewart: dawagner: I have some changes to the java crazy fun that make it easier to cache the outputs of a build
[18:04:05] simonstewart: That should allow us to avoid doing a rebuild from source every time
[18:04:09] simonstewart: Which would be nice
[18:04:44] dawagner: Woo!
[18:05:07] simonstewart: Was a little tired on the plane, so my plans to actually put in caching floundered
[18:05:09] lukeis: yeah it would… especially with the wonkiness that is this: building iphone causes firefox to build :-/  (i haven't tried to run down the dependency rule(s) that cause that)
[18:05:43] simonstewart: Basically, the problem I ran into is that the attributes of a build target may expand to a completely different set of files/artifacts per run while remaining the same
[18:05:52] simonstewart: Which means I need to move blobbing to the client side
[18:06:00] simonstewart: (which it should have been all along)
[18:06:19] simonstewart: I also hooked up the infrastructure for source-side coprocessors
[18:06:34] simonstewart: There's one hooked in now that will make sure that prod code can't depend on test code
[18:06:54] simonstewart: Also found out that I need to implement cycle detection. Bah
[18:07:16] simonstewart: Had a basic impl of this implemented: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan's_strongly_connected_components_algorithm

[18:14:29] simonstewart: Who has the release bacon?

[18:15:11] simonstewart: By the look of things
[18:16:08] jimevans: i'd love to know what those firefox native events failures are all about.
[18:16:33] jimevans: and why chrome on linux is so vastly broken.
[18:17:01] simonstewart: I'm not going to let chrome on linux be a blocker: it's on a separate release schedule
[18:17:11] jimevans: but i've got my hands full with work i get paid for and keeping IE in shape.
[18:17:14] simonstewart: But, yeah, those firefox 17 failures are odd.
[18:17:23] simonstewart: Any idea about the IE10 and 6 failures?
[18:17:38] simonstewart: 6 looks like an atoms failure
[18:17:59] jimevans: the IE 6 javascript failures are because IE crashes in CI. they're using windows 2003, not xp, so it has a different version of IE6.
[18:18:01] simonstewart: IE 10 is failing pretty spectacularly. Was it like that when we pushed 2.27?
[18:18:05] jimevans: yes.
[18:18:15] jimevans: those are windows 8-specific, afaict
[18:18:23] simonstewart: OK. So IE is "passing" as far as we care?
[18:18:27] jimevans: yes.

[18:21:54] simonstewart: Oh, hai gecko sdk

[18:23:24] Nari114: :ask
[18:23:24] selbot2: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[18:23:40] Nari114: (learnt that from Jim ;))
[18:23:47] simonstewart: You've got a good crowd in to ask too
[18:25:01] lukeis: don't listen to simon, he likes to pretend he knows everything ;)
[18:25:02] newselenium: when i run tests wiht that configuration, and the test has to select from a drop down list. it does not initate the javascript with regards to that selection
[18:26:27] newselenium: the script does the selection correctly, but it does not initiate the future changes that are suppose to take place due to it
[18:26:34] jimevans: newselenium: that usually happens when the page in question is using some javascript widget library (jquery, dojo, extjs, or similar), and the widget library developers have done something wonky.
[18:26:51] barancev: simonstewart: openWindow passed in FF17 and IE9, I'll try Chrome later
[18:27:16] barancev: atm I'm trying to decrease memory usage by WDBS tests
[18:28:10] jimevans: newselenium: unfortunately, since every one of those is different, we (and by "we", i mean "i") usually need a page demonstrating the problem to be able to properly debug it.
[18:28:57] simonstewart: Cool. WDBS for Firefox 17 on my mac passed.
[18:29:04] simonstewart: Looks like the failure has something to do with linux
[18:29:21] barancev: which failure?

[18:30:45] lukeis: the native FF17 tests passed for me on my linux box
[18:30:57] lukeis: that job failed due to not being able to delete a tmp file?

[18:38:14] art_man1: Hello All. I'm trying to create some tests using Webdriver and Ruby. Our web development is done using Sproutcore, which I'm being told acts like EXTJS in the way that id's are generated automatically. I'm told that the framework needs these generic id's, and as a workaround static attributes will be added to each element that we could then use. So it seems all of our tests will have to be based on specific attributes. Is this doab
[18:38:14] art_man1: Any recommendations? 
[18:39:22] RossPatterson: Yes, it's doable.
[18:41:10] art_man1: RossPatterson: Great, thank you. 
[18:41:19] RossPatterson: The hardest part about JavaScript frameworks like ExtJs, Dojo, and SproutCore is figuring out what object to click/type/etc against.  This is most especially true of "comboboxes" and calendar controls, both of which tend to be synthesized from wierd collections of HTML pieces.
[18:41:48] art_man1: Ahh ok.
[18:42:07] simonstewart has joined #selenium
[18:42:59] RossPatterson: It's because the framework designers build the complex controls from things normal HTML never encourages clicking/typing/etc. on.  But beyond that, it's not so hard.
[18:43:23] simonstewart: IE9 is green on CI
[18:43:23] simonstewart: barancev: ^^
[18:43:29] RossPatterson: We use Selenium on a mixture of Prototype.js, Yahoo! User Interface (YUI), and ExtJS, and it works.
[18:43:49] barancev: simonstewart: I mean WDBS in IE9
[18:44:03] art_man1: Are you using CSS locators? 
[18:44:08] simonstewart: I thought we'd fixed that ages ago
[18:44:34] RossPatterson: The second hardest part is deciding how to identify the things you want to click/type/etc. on.  When your ID attributes aren't predictable, there are lots of alternatives.
[18:44:51] RossPatterson: We mostly use XPath locators, but CSS locators are often a good choice too.
[18:45:10] *RossPatterson waits for lukeis to consign XPath to the depths of Heck.
[18:45:23] art_man1: RossPatterson: Ok. I've been using xpath, but I keep reading it's not the best.
[18:45:32] RossPatterson: It's a matter of opinion.
[18:45:39] lukeis: :) xpath has only 2 use cases for me ;)
[18:45:44] jleyba: Use XPath as a last resort
[18:45:47] jleyba: A very, very last resort
[18:45:54] lukeis: find by text and find a parent
[18:45:54] RossPatterson: XPath is extremely powerful, and with extreme power comes extreme confusion.
[18:45:56] lukeis: otherwise use CSS :-D
[18:46:03] jleyba: I would use a JS locator through executeScript before using XPath
[18:46:13] RossPatterson: jleyba: Or for finding things that contain specific text.
[18:46:32] barancev: what's bad about xpath?
[18:46:47] RossPatterson: But also, XPath is slow in some browsers, particularly in Internet Explorer.
[18:46:49] RossPatterson: barancev: Nothing, in my opinion.
[18:46:59] jleyba: barancev: Slow, hard to debug, hard to keep up to date
[18:47:02] lukeis: i like CSS much more cause you can actually talk to UI dev's about it and when they see the selectors they start to understand more about testing and make thiings better in the app too
[18:47:05] barancev: xpah is slow in IE6, but who uese it?
[18:47:10] jleyba: screw IE6
[18:47:36] barancev: in other browsers xpath is as fast as css is, sometimes even faster, I did benchmarks
[18:47:37] RossPatterson: There are many things you can express in XPath that you cannot in CSS.  It's much more than merely :contains() and ..
[18:48:07] barancev: FF and chrome do xpath very fast
[18:48:30] barancev: IE is slow even without xpath as compared to FF aand Chrome
[18:48:38] *RossPatterson loves people who respond to vague allegations of slowness with benchmark results proving speed :-)
[18:49:24] RossPatterson: But we digress ... art_man1, are you feeling more confident?
[18:49:50] art_man1: hahaha
[18:50:00] art_man1: Well I'm learning something.
[18:50:29] RossPatterson: We're a friendly but opinionated crowd, and we disgree on some points :-)
[18:50:44] art_man1: I've looked into the CSS way, but my inexperience has held me back. So xpath has been my approach because of that, and because of the EXTJS.
[18:51:10] *lukeis did some testing too with speed between xpath / css.. depended on a lot of factors but the ones i used in general were faster to use css (against firefox is where I was mainly concerned)
[18:51:15] barancev: ExtJS is a different beast
[18:51:32] barancev: it is hard to write a good xpath for extjs elements
[18:51:33] RossPatterson: You can do ExtJS with CSS locators too.  I've done it here for some experimental components, but we later switched them to using Backbone.js.
[18:51:44] barancev: as hard as good css locators
[18:52:30] art_man1: I guess that is my next thing is understanding the CSS locators.
[18:52:32] RossPatterson: It's hard to write a good ANYTHING for ExtJs, but that's not because of Selenium, or XPath, or CSS.  ExtJs is just hard to automate.
[18:52:35] nhirata has joined #selenium
[18:52:42] barancev: but qooxdoo is worse :)
[18:52:53] art_man1: Ugh.
[18:52:55] RossPatterson: CSS locators are really simple when you get right down to it.
[18:53:06] RossPatterson: barancev: Well, with a name like qiuweyr9q23n vuq3ynv4ui vbwaheifu, how good could it be?
[18:53:44] RossPatterson: art_man1: Selenium's CSS locators are exactly the CSS specifications "selectors".
[18:53:52] lukeis: art_man1: if you can understand the spec, this is all one needs http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#selectors 
[18:54:07] RossPatterson: So any books, presentation, tutorials, on CSS Selectors apply to Selenium.
[18:54:13] *RossPatterson loves that part.

[19:11:29] barancev: it is on purpose?
[19:11:42] FalCone: Uh. So I'm pulling every script tag on a page and need to check the contents of their SRC
[19:11:43] simonstewart: Ultimately, the RC code waited until the readyState was "interactive" or "complete"

[19:14:35] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: no argument from me, was just asking
[19:14:40] simonstewart: :)
[19:14:56] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: there was a chicken little moment last night about phantomjs
[19:15:12] simonstewart: That's what prompted me into action.

[19:15:16] simonstewart: ?
[19:15:26] AutomatedTester: you should
[19:15:32] barancev: simonstewart: where is this readyState waiting code in RC?
[19:15:34] AutomatedTester: I thought you would be busy with learning php
[19:15:46] simonstewart: barancev: "somewhere" I'd need to do digging to find it
[19:15:53] barancev: according to the docs, ""Selenium constantly keeps track of new pages loading, and sets a "newPageLoaded"  flag when it first notices a page load
[19:16:04] knorrium_ has joined #selenium
[19:16:15] simonstewart: But that's one of the reasons we package our own firefox profile: for earlier firefox releases it added a readyState property
[19:16:20] barancev: that's all, it just tracks onLoad events and sets a flag
[19:16:33] simonstewart: barancev: when the docs and the code disagree, the docs aren't right

[19:26:22] barancev: alerts stored in window.__webdriverAlerts array

[19:26:33] barancev: also FF16 
[19:27:00] simonstewart: Well, arse
[19:27:01] barancev: and when driver opens a new page window.__webdriverAlerts is cleaned

[19:27:17] simonstewart: We used to have the alert tests in there
[19:27:46] barancev: JS gurus (lukeis?) told me that windows object for a new page is not the same, and hence all its properties are lost
[19:28:09] barancev: atm all alerts tests are commented out in wdbs test suite
[19:28:20] simonstewart: Oh yeah

[19:28:50] simonstewart: Implementing that in a RC compatible way would be a complete PITA
[19:29:18] simonstewart: You're just going to need to handle alerts using webdriver in the case where the page actually reloads.
[19:30:05] barancev: that's what I wanted to suggest - can't we move to native alerts implementation? what are possible drawbacks?
[19:30:17] jleyba: barancev: two totally different models
[19:30:28] knorrium has joined #selenium
[19:30:30] simonstewart: jleyba's nailed it
[19:30:33] jleyba: RC API is a predictive alert, WebDriver is reactive
[19:32:01] barancev: we can implement predictive model in Java code, and implement it using webdriver abilities
[19:32:04] RossPatterson: barancev: RC's ready-state check is baked into the Firefox custom profile.  In the old RC-1.x source, that's in /server-coreless/src/main/resources/customProfileDirCUSTFF/extensions/readystate@openqa.org/chrome/readystate.jar

[19:32:39] jleyba: that's specific to Safari, but the underlying problem is the same as RC
[19:32:46] *RossPatterson gropes the code
[19:33:01] jleyba: it's really hard (if not impossible) to implement a reactive alert API for JS
[19:33:20] RossPatterson: barancev: /java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/server/customProfileDirCUSTFF/extensions/readystate@openqa.org/chrome/readystate.jar
[19:33:41] *RossPatterson hates having JARs in the source tree, especially when all they contain is text files.
[19:33:54] barancev: jleyba: we don't need to implement reactive alert API
[19:34:30] barancev: we need to implement predictive model (WDBS) on the basis of exising reactive model (WebDriver)
[19:34:50] barancev: is this ever possible?
[19:35:19] simonstewart: Not without jumping through a surprising number of hoops
[19:38:12] barancev: so alerts implementation works for the current page only. not very usable
[19:40:44] simonstewart: WEll, it covers many of the common cases.
