[10:46:47] solofight: Ardesco: there is no selenium inbuilt way to do this ?
[10:46:52] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[10:47:11] Ardesco: to get coordinates, yes look at the two links
[10:47:19] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[10:47:25] Ardesco: it gets coordinates using selenium
[10:47:41] Ardesco: then does a nasty hack to use a java robot class to click on those coordinates
[10:47:58] Ardesco: because Safari doesn't have any native events or Actions support
[10:48:39] Ardesco: all that being said, you should be able to construct a CSS or XPath locator for you button even if it has no name/id
[10:48:47] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[10:48:49] Ardesco: so I don't really know why you want to get the coordinates

[10:52:50] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[10:52:59] Ardesco: i'd need to see the HTML
[10:53:11] Ardesco: but at a quick guess //button[1]
[10:53:18] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[10:53:21] Ardesco: or button:nth-child(1)
[10:53:30] Ardesco: unless it's an input type button
[10:53:42] Ardesco: in which case //input[1]
[10:53:55] Ardesco: or input:nth-child(1)
[10:54:12] Ardesco: you would obviously need to switch to the correct frame first
[10:54:23] solofight: ohh - let me try input[1]

[11:06:34] solofight: is that possible using selenium ?
[11:06:37] Ardesco: WHY WOULD YOU WANT USER INTERACTION WITH AN AUTOMATED TEST?

[11:07:57] solofight: i need to read the value presented in the page using javascript and then format that value and enter that into another text box. Now i want to go step by step
[11:08:06] solofight: so first prompt user to enter value
[11:08:21] solofight: then read the value from one entity and store and validate against another

[14:01:43] andreastt: <input type=password placeholder=foo>?
[14:02:27] nirvdrum: The problem is on IE people have resorted to weird hacks whereby they add a new element and hide the original.
[14:02:37] cmcgraw has joined #selenium
[14:02:49] nirvdrum: So, you can't simply find by name = 'password' and call send_keys on it, as the element is set to display: none; at that point.
[14:03:23] nirvdrum: I'm between executeScript and getting the element's coordinates and clicking at that location.
[14:05:43] barancev: nirvdrum: yes, IE driver doesn't want to return location of an invisible element, it's a selenium issue
[14:06:06] barancev: but it's related to "hidden" elements
[14:06:36] barancev: an "invisible" element with display:none has no location al all, how do you get its coordinates?
[14:06:57] nirvdrum: Yeah.  Each version of IE does something weird there.

[14:21:06] nirvdrum: barancev: Thanks.  The problem, if you will, is this is just one page of many that I need to test and I have no control over the ID convention.
[14:21:34] nirvdrum: This is for the generic page login method I have for mogotest.
[14:21:56] nirvdrum: Setting the value directly in JS may be my only real option here.
[14:22:17] barancev: nirvdrum: you know, good page design is the key to testability :)
[14:22:48] nirvdrum: barancev: Sure is.  But I can't tell my customers to go redesign their pages so I can test them :-/
[14:22:55] nirvdrum: I.e., this ends up being my problem, not theirs.
[14:23:05] barancev: why not, I did this sometimes
[14:23:31] nirvdrum: Because they're right.  It works fine for a human.
[14:23:53] nirvdrum: And it is testable.  Just not in a manner that I can widely apply.
[14:23:54] barancev: they pay for testing. and I know thyy can save some money here by spending them to a better page design
[14:24:22] nirvdrum: What's the better page design?  They want a placeholder for a password field and IE doesn't support it.
[14:24:35] nirvdrum: Their solution isn't bad.  It just sucks for me.
[14:24:58] barancev: you told about "ID conventions" -- it's possible to negotiate this
[14:25:29] barancev: if you have good IDs, and other things to use good location, placeholders is not the issue for WebDriver
[14:25:39] barancev: *good locators, even
[14:25:46] nirvdrum: I test thousands of pages.  I can't negotiate that with every client.  It's not scalable.
[14:25:59] nirvdrum: And all it takes is one to tell me "no" for the whole thing to fall apart.
[14:26:45] nirvdrum: I agree it'd be ideal.  But reality prevails in this case.

[17:10:44] jleyba: jimevans: we didn't have a standing army until WWI
[17:10:44] llaskin: jimevans: during the initial conception of the USC, a militia was ALL men between ages of 18-40ish.
[17:10:52] llaskin: jleyba: exactly
[17:12:31] RossPatterson: Perhaps the NRA failed to note that the first victim of the Newton shooter had a passel of weapons of her own, and was killed with them.  So much for the "arm the world and it will all work out" argument.
[17:13:02] jimevans: i'm aware of the history, guys. let me rephrase the question: is there such a thing as a "well regulated militia" in modern society?

[17:13:43] davehunt has joined #selenium
[17:13:47] jleyba: but some police forces are looking more and more militaristic (i.e. Oakland PD)
[17:14:08] llaskin: jimevans: no there isn't IMO
[17:14:14] llaskin: the army != militia
[17:14:24] llaskin: the national guard may come close
[17:14:36] llaskin: but with recently deployments of NG troops outside of US borders i would argue that it is no longer a militia
[17:15:14] jimevans: llaskin: then doesn't that mean the constitutional rationale for the second amendment (as stated in the amendment text) is anachronistic?
[17:15:53] llaskin: i don't think  you're using the correct word
[17:16:17] jimevans: no, i think i am. it's outdated, no longer useful, a product of a bygone era.
[17:16:27] llaskin: no i disagree
[17:16:38] llaskin: i think citizens being able to arm themselves is definitely not a product of a bygone era
[17:16:43] jimevans: sorry, i misspoke.
[17:16:50] llaskin: in fact since the sunset of the 94 AWB, crimes have gone down.
[17:17:30] llaskin: also, if you want to talk about a law abiding group of citizens, BY AND LARGE, gun owners are one of the most law abiding people out there...
[17:17:56] jimevans: i'm asking if, according to the text of the second amendment, the constitutional rationale for the "right to keep and bear arms" no longer applies.
[17:18:42] llaskin: the SC argues that it isn't.
[17:18:46] jimevans: for reference, i give you the actual text of the amendment: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
[17:18:48] llaskin: Heller vs DC, McDonald vs Chicago.
[17:18:53] llaskin: no ty, i know the 2nd pretty well:)
[17:19:25] jimevans: llaskin: i'm sure you do. that's for the benefit of others playing along at home, particularly those who may not live in the US.
[17:20:32] *lukeis was really hoping for the apocalypse instead of talking about stupid guns :)
[17:20:34] jimevans: and i know what scotus argues on the issue. i'm asking for personal opinions.

[17:20:42] lukeis: i know ;)

[17:27:00] llaskin: jimevans: surprisingly the NRA is relatively small compared to some other groups

[17:31:10] jimevans: lukeis: as a youngster, i had similar feelings about nuclear war.
[17:31:50] llaskin: jimevans: great book...awful movie
[17:32:16] lukeis: yeah, as a person who lives / works in a large city most of his life, i too think that about nukes (and i would likely be in the blast zone, rather than the fall-out area)

[17:49:14] beeplogic: newb here, starting to play around with web driver. I'm running a node on a windows machine, the browser (firefox) opens and i do driver.findElement(By.xpath()) and call click, but nothing happens. if i run the node locally (mac, firefox) the same code works. the only thing that's odd on mac is that it seems the click won't fire until i "interact" with the page ( roll over a menu item on the page that i'm trying to call click on )

[17:57:59] beeplogic: and as i mentioned earlier, the same code without modifications works on FF running in OS X
[17:58:16] beeplogic: i haven't compared versions yet tho...
[17:58:26] KaibutsuX: beeplogic: so you're trying to follow the href of the anchor?
[17:58:32] beeplogic: yes
[17:58:32] KaibutsuX: you might need to click the a instead of the img
[17:58:43] KaibutsuX: so xpath="//img[@alt='']/parent::a
[17:59:09] beeplogic: i did import the click() part from the generated IDE code from FF
[17:59:45] beeplogic: guess i assumed it would mimic the actual browser behavior when you click on an image contained within an anchor element
[17:59:55] KaibutsuX: I've seen differing results
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Dec 21 18:00:13 2012]
[18:00:13] beeplogic: FF versions are the same, 17.0.1
[18:00:49] KaibutsuX: if the css class on the img positions it some weird way, it's possible the click isn't hitting the a's boundary
[18:00:57] KaibutsuX: but I'm not an expert on how that works
[18:01:04] KaibutsuX: but I would just try clicking the a instead

[18:19:26] lukeis: avillanueva-npr: often with dynamic things like this, you want to wait until the previous element (one of the table items in your case i think, or mabye the button) goes Stale. Look at the ExpectedConditions.stalesnessOf  and then after it goes stale, you find the new elements with another wait (as you are doing it looks like)

[20:02:02] jimevans: regex: well, again, i say don't do it. don't click on the download link to begin with. read the blog post lukeis pointed to above. (unless your download dialog is part of the "external winform app" you're talking about)
[20:02:29] intchanter-work2 has joined #selenium
[20:02:49] jimevans: there are better ways to test that the download link is a valid link than clicking on it.
[20:03:04] jimevans: if that's what you're interested in.
[20:03:30] regex: No.  I just want to test any windows pop-ups or dialogs that prompt users.  I want to just click X on them or whatever else.
[20:04:44] barancev: regex: use AutoItX in addition to Selenium, to click crosses
[20:05:07] jimevans: regex: again, what dialogs do you expect in the course of interacting with your web application? i'd assume only those that can be spawned by the browser. in the case of file downloads, don't interact with them at all, just validate that the link points to a valid file and call it a day. in the case of javascript alerts, use SwitchTo().Alert() to handle those.
[20:05:10] adamgoucher: but that will only work on windows...
[20:05:25] jimevans: do not, do not, do not, do not use AutoIt.
[20:05:26] barancev: adamgoucher: .Net on non-Windows platrom?
[20:05:39] barancev: for fanatics :)
[20:05:43] jimevans: barancev: absolutely. webdriver works on mono.
[20:06:10] barancev: whoever implements production apps in mono is a fanatic, imho :)

[20:06:58] jimevans: barancev: but you asked about .NET on non-windows platforms. yes, it's possible to run .NET webdriver code on non-windows platforms. that's the question i answered.
[20:07:19] adamgoucher: joy. so chromium is a 2.5g tarball, then you have to use custom tools to manage the repo. thanks gang. they and android need a special version control jail.
[20:07:20] jeichar has joined #selenium
[20:07:22] barancev: jimevans: yes, I know, you're right, in general
[20:07:54] barancev: but I bet 99.9% of people talking about .Net mean Windows platform
[20:07:55] nerd has joined #selenium
[20:08:17] barancev: jimevans: and what's bad about AutoIt?
[20:08:31] *jimevans notes that if webdriver exposed the process identifier of the browser being automated, it'd be possible to create a companion project for handling OS-level windows.
[20:08:40] adamgoucher: but even if you write a script in .net on windows, the end execution node could be linux or mac and autoit wont work there
[20:09:21] barancev: jimevans: and, of course, OS-level automation is hard if you run browser on a remote server
[20:10:27] jimevans: barancev: they closed their source, it's impossible to target windows launched by a specific process, it increases the barrier to entry of anyone wanting to work on your code because you have yet another scripting language you need to learn.
[20:10:34] barancev: adamgoucher: yes, AutoIt don't recognize "native" dialogs in FF, Chrome and new IEs
[20:11:21] barancev: jimevans: I mean AutoItX the COM component, not AutoIt the tool
[20:12:17] barancev: jimevans: yu can easily instantiate and use it from .Net, Ruby, Python, and there is a Java wrapper for AutoItX
[20:12:44] jimevans: barancev: hard, but not impossible. i have a prototype of a cross-platform, native dialog handling library (in C#, no less). Unfortunately, it requires knowing the window that "owns" the dialog, which webdriver doesn't expose.
[20:13:29] barancev: as the last resolt, Sikuli
[20:13:49] barancev: and you remenper there is SikuliWebDriver hybrid somewhere on the Internet
[20:13:57] jimevans: sure, if you're willing to use java.
[20:14:08] barancev: Java wins!
[20:15:40] jimevans: deliberately provocative statement warning: if a solution isn't easily translatable into <arbitrary language of my choice that i'm already using for the majority of my solution>, it's not a solution for me.
[20:17:42] barancev: peace, brother, I don't want to say any bad words about other langs, it was a provocation, too :)
[20:18:16] *RossPatterson can hear happy generic holiday music playing in the background :-)

[20:19:39] RossPatterson: Gotta love The Waitresses.
[20:20:39] adamgoucher: gah. the chromium tarball has /home/src_tarball/tarball/chromium as the internal dir structure.
[20:28:34] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: why are you using chromium?
[20:28:57] adamgoucher: i want to see what is triggering a message in the chromedriver
[20:29:20] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: wouldnt it be quicker to read the source?
[20:29:48] adamgoucher: i'll get to that step eventually
[20:31:21] Ardesco has joined #selenium
[20:32:03] adamgoucher: i'm both amused and not surprised that two major projects inside google reinvented entire toolchains .. and dont use the same reinventions
[20:33:52] RossPatterson: Not Invented Here wasn't invented here.
[20:35:09] regex: jimevans: thank you!  I'd love to see some of that code sometime
[20:36:08] barancev: jimevans: btw, can we implement in IE getting location of hidden and invisible elements?
[20:36:24] jimevans: regex: it's pretty complex, because it's designed to handle arbitrary dialogs and be event-driven. it's not really ready for public consumption.
[20:36:46] barancev: jimevans: see new CoordinatesTest class in Java
[20:37:36] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[20:38:43] *simonstewart thinks I should read the coordinates test to see whether I agree with it :)
[20:39:16] barancev: simonstewart: sure you should
[20:39:37] jimevans: barancev: not until everyone comes to a concrete agreement what the coordinates behavior should be. :)
[20:39:43] cgoldberg: adamgoucher, do you need the repo?  just intall chromium-browser package
[20:39:55] barancev: I've just fixed the beaviour implemented "by majority"
[20:40:38] barancev: if we change tests, we'll need to fix drivers for FF and Chrome
[20:40:52] adamgoucher: cgoldberg: dunno. my first instinct when looking for code is to grab the repo. apparently a flawed instinct with chromium and android
[20:41:01] simonstewart: "Screen" means "monitor" not "viewport"
[20:41:28] simonstewart: Do hidden elements (or rather, elements that are not displayed in general) actually have a location?
[20:41:46] jimevans: what does the getLocation atom do?
[20:41:48] cgoldberg: adamgoucher, ah not sure about android.  on Debian/Ubuntu, it's just: $ sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
[20:42:01] barancev: simonstewart: hidden elements have location and size
[20:42:02] simonstewart: Returns the location of the element relative to the top left corner of the document
[20:42:06] barancev: they can take place
[20:42:12] simonstewart: Really?
[20:42:49] jimevans: simonstewart: even for hidden elements?
[20:42:52] adamgoucher: cgoldberg: ah. ya, i can get the built browser find but hunting down chromdriver's 'done loading' algorithm. android does this crazy parallel git thing or something
[20:43:00] barancev: simonstewart: please open common/src/web/coordinates_tests/page_with_hidden_element.html in the browser
[20:43:03] avillanueva-npr has left #selenium
[20:43:12] simonstewart: jimevans: it does a bunch of DOM calculations. Never tested on a hidden element. WHO WOULD DO THAT?
[20:44:05] barancev: this page shows that a hidden box takes place, it has size and location
[20:44:19] simonstewart: barancev: wow
[20:44:22] jimevans: simonstewart: well, that's why i'm asking, don't you see? barancev is asking for Coordinates.getLocationOnScreen() to return values for hidden elements in the IE driver. if WebElement.getLocation() doesn't return values for hidden elements, why should the other?
[20:44:53] simonstewart: I don't know what the others actually do. I think that the firefox driver uses the same atom
[20:45:04] Ardesco has joined #selenium
[20:45:10] jimevans: (and the IE driver relies exclusively on the atom for getLocation, not for Coordinates.getLocationOnScreen)
[20:45:26] testingb0t has joined #selenium
[20:45:33] simonstewart: getLocationOnScreen is useful for implementing the Actions using the AWT Robot
[20:45:41] simonstewart: If you used them in the driver, I'd be surprised
[20:45:44] jimevans: and implementing what he's asking for in IE may be a massive pain in the ass.
[20:46:15] barancev: jimevans: getLocation atom fixed by r18348
[20:46:17] selbot2_: 03barancev 6 days ago - AlexeiBarantsev: Implementing ability to get location for elements that are not visible (for various reasons). Adding tests for getting location. Fixes issue 4890 | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=18348 | http://seleniumhq.org/ci.jsp?r=18348
[20:46:22] simonstewart: What's in the test isn't terribly accurate with the intended meaning of the APIs
[20:46:27] simonstewart: I'd ignore the entire test for now
[20:46:35] testingb0t has joined #selenium
[20:47:05] simonstewart: OK. barancev and jimevans, I'd suggest taking this on to the dev list.
[20:47:10] simonstewart: I really need to leave the country
[20:47:19] jimevans: until and unless we come to a consensus on the behavior of Coordinates.getLocationOnScreen(), the IE driver won't be changing.
[20:47:24] barancev: simonstewart: yes, getLocationOnScreen returns location in viewport, I told you it's drastically broken I understood this after the talk two days ago
[20:47:42] simonstewart: That's why this test should be ignored
[20:47:49] simonstewart: "screen" != "viewport"
[20:47:59] barancev: agree
[20:48:05] jimevans: s/behavior of Coordinates.getLocationOnScreen()/behavior of Coordinates.getLocationOnScreen() for hidden elements/

[21:21:14] AutomatedTester: i still find it weird to do easy_install pip on new machines
[21:21:58] adamgoucher: heh. the 'install package manager a in order to be package manager b' dance is a bit wierd
[21:24:24] AutomatedTester: its more 'install the crap package manager to install the better package manager'
[21:24:57] adamgoucher: all package managers are crap. its whether you can live with its variant of crap
[21:25:58] *adamgoucher gives up. chromedriver + frames = suckage
[21:26:40] AutomatedTester: <driver> + frames == suckage
[21:26:52] jleyba: frames == suckage
[21:26:58] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, first thing i do on Ubuntu is $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv   .. you get virtualenv/pip/distribute
[21:27:16] *lukeis recommends the driver.switchTo().parentFrame() again ;)
[21:27:32] adamgoucher: this site works fine with firefox, but after a certain number of frame switches it just hangs
[21:27:39] adamgoucher: (on chrome that is)
[21:27:57] *jleyba wouldn't mind switchTo().parentFrame() and renaming switchTo().defaultContent() to switchTo().top()
[21:28:19] *jleyba would also like a switchTo().opener() for windows
