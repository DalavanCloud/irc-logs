[19:31:38] AutomatedTester: detronizator: yo
[19:31:45] AutomatedTester: whats your question
[19:33:37] detronizator: hey AutomatedTester
[19:33:38] detronizator: hi
[19:33:48] detronizator: the question is about "click()". let me grab a link
[19:34:17] detronizator: https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/pull/96
[19:34:54] detronizator: AutomatedTester: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#click()
[19:35:06] detronizator: how you decide WHEN to wait?
[19:35:14] detronizator: clicking on stuff can cause all sort of stuff
[19:35:34] AutomatedTester: when to go to a new page?
[19:35:39] detronizator: which scenario should be considered "special" and "waited for"
[19:35:40] detronizator: ?
[19:36:03] AutomatedTester: when going to a new page you wait
[19:36:08] AutomatedTester: otherwise you dont
[19:36:20] detronizator: all sort of stuff can "send you to a new page"
[19:37:03] detronizator: the one that by default do it are: <a href and <input type="submit".
[19:37:04] detronizator: right?
[19:37:17] detronizator: and I was thinking, I should probably consider only those "special"
[19:38:03] detronizator: but the documentation of those API is quite "generic" and doesn't tell you EXACTLY on what scenario you wait
[19:38:12] detronizator: or better, on what TAGS you wait
[19:38:58] AutomatedTester: detronizator: its in the code
[19:39:47] detronizator: so, no where to get the "thinking behind/before" the coe
[19:39:48] detronizator: code
[19:40:40] *AutomatedTester can grep through the click code to find it
[19:40:51] AutomatedTester: but so could you :)
[19:42:39] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[19:42:53] awilson820 has left #selenium
[19:42:56] AutomatedTester: detronizator: from a quick grep it looks like we add an eventListener
[19:43:17] AutomatedTester: if we see the page is changing thenwait
[19:44:24] detronizator: I need to look at the atom then. As I'm using it already, I think I might just need to add some "wdriver-side code" to handle those scenarios
[19:44:25] detronizator: thanks
[19:44:47] jarib: detronizator: i think this particular part is browser-specific and not entirely standardized
[19:45:44] AutomatedTester: the firefox code adds a listener to see if we are moving somewhere
[19:45:46] jarib: detronizator: when i played with the webkit APIs from Obj-C a long time ago, I remember being able to hook into "page load progress"-type events
[19:45:49] detronizator: jarib: yes. But I think I could see if I can handle it: trying won't cost much. Not sure when I'll try though: I'm still trying to go through a proper 1.0 announcement post :)
[19:46:20] jarib: i.e. same APIs you'd use to display a progress bar for page load if you were writing a browser
[19:46:29] detronizator: AutomatedTester: jarib: yes, definitely doable. I got all the hooks C++ side.
[19:46:53] jarib: right, i think that's what you want in this case
[19:47:25] detronizator: I just haven't implemented it that way. Because clicks can do "all sort of shit", handling corner case scenarios of "sometimes you mihgt want to wait" sounded not a good way to go.
[19:48:18] detronizator: but I recon I could at least "see what can be done", assuming that, if stuff doesn't kick in within a timer window, I have to consider everything "done" and finish/abort
[19:48:30] detronizator: thanks AutomatedTester & jarib
[19:48:36] AutomatedTester: no worries :)
