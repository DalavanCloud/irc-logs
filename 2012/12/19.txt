[15:15:48] llaskin: hi jim!
[15:15:54] WSelenium: Hey I'm getting some weird issue in IE after updating to a Selenium that no longer uses the internal server and was wondering if anyone here is experienced with IE
[15:17:21] *jimevans looks around whistling softly, hoping on one will point him out.
[15:17:40] WSelenium: jim are you able to help?

[15:18:11] WSelenium: alright let me describe the behavior for you
[15:18:14] andreastt: jimevans: Hi there JIm.
[15:18:42] jimevans: andreastt: hey. The Wife sends her best. :)
[15:19:04] andreastt: Hi, the wife! o/
[15:19:40] WSelenium: in an asp.net site the drop down menus now do a very wierd behavor the old behavor was scroll over, link drops down everything normal, now that link flashes and clicking links inside is almost impossible, it sometimes does it, other times it doesn't.
[15:19:58] WSelenium: drop down flashes*
[15:20:10] Sushi has left #selenium
[15:20:47] jimevans: WSelenium: there was an attempt to fix the problem with hovering in IE requiring that the physical mouse cursor be outside the IE window. you can revert to the old behavior by setting the "enablePersistentHover" capability to false.
[15:21:38] WSelenium: hm so if the mouse is outside of the window it should work without problem then?
[15:21:54] jimevans: no, that's not what i said.
[15:22:19] WSelenium: ok, thats why I asked make sure my understanding was spot on or horribly off :P
[15:22:39] WSelenium: what does that setting actually do though?
[15:23:23] jimevans: there used to be (still is, really) an issue with IE that if you attempt to hover the mouse, and the mouse cursor is within the bounds of the IE window, you could see the hover happen, and then IE would do some hit-testing that would cause it to see the cursor where it *actually* is.
[15:24:09] WSelenium: so is it based on that the curser is not near the hover point that causes the flashing?
[15:24:14] jimevans: see http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/06/whats-wrong-with-internet-explorer.html for a more thorough discussion of the issue.
[15:24:21] jimevans: let me finish.
[15:25:38] jimevans: there was an attempt to resolve this issue by repeatedly throwing WM_MOUSEMOVE messages at the IE window to attempt to fool IE into believing that the cursor is where webdriver says it is.
[15:26:24] jimevans: because this is an intrusive, and not entirely reliable, way to solve the problem, you can revert back to the original behavior.
[15:27:05] jimevans: however, you may still experience the original problem, wherein the hover is not "persistent" if the physical mouse cursor is within the bounds of the IE window.
[15:27:50] jimevans: the setting tells the IE driver "don't keep throwing WM_MOUSEMOVE messages to the IE window"
[15:28:21] jimevans: incidentally, the change list that introduced the behavior is r17545.

[16:16:21] WSelenium: jimevans: if I might bother you again with some IE questions, sorry for the pesters still novice with selenium, now I can get it so that the drop don't flash but the new problem is once it hovers, it doesn't stay "open" the hover happens for a brief moment, but not long enough to do a next step of clicking an element inside, thus I'm getting element not visible exception.  Any suggestions?
[16:17:00] jimevans: WSelenium: make sure the physical mouse cursor isn't within the bounds of the IE window.
[16:17:11] jimevans: did you read the blog post i linked to earlier?
[16:18:06] WSelenium: I've actually read it before but ill reread it here now, and ill verify that the mouse is not within the window

[16:27:52] WSelenium: How do you turn them off in IE?
[16:29:08] intchanter-work has joined #selenium
[16:30:17] jimevans: set the "nativeEvents" capability to false.
[16:30:54] jimevans: note that if your site uses javascript alerts (window.alert() or window.confirm()) in any places, your webdriver code will no longer work.
[16:31:45] WSelenium: >_<
[16:31:45] Bico_Fino has joined #selenium
[16:32:11] WSelenium: is it possible to turn them on and off? haha.. dreaming right
[16:32:15] jimevans: nope.
[16:32:48] jimevans: if you can come up with a way to solve this problem for IE, patches are very welcome.
[16:32:51] jimevans: :)
[16:33:35] jimevans: but the internals of IE (as near as anyone can tell) are what causes problems with mouse hovering. our hacks around it work for most cases.
[16:34:34] jimevans: oh, and native events are the *only* way to get hovers to work if they're done with CSS rather than javascript. simulated events won't trigger a CSS hover.
[16:34:44] dude-x has joined #selenium
[16:34:49] WSelenium: yeah, its weird since the internal server, I didn't have the problem til I updated to the external :\
[16:34:56] WSelenium: I miss that legacy I know bad me
[16:35:15] jimevans: it's not the internal vs external server that's the problem.
[16:35:34] jimevans: there is no difference between the code in the internal and external servers. full stop.
[16:35:41] WSelenium: I know that, what was the big change though between the interactions
[16:35:43] WSelenium: hmm
[16:38:40] jimevans: bottom line, a mouse move (which is what a "hover" is) is accomplished in IE using native events by sending a WM_MOUSEMOVE message to the IE window.
[16:38:54] alexglow has joined #selenium
[16:40:46] jimevans: my speculation is (and observation bears this out) that when the main IE event pump receives WM_MOUSEMOVE messages, it does a hit-test, probably calling the Win32 WindowFromPoint() API. this reports the "real" location of the physical mouse pointer, and the message pump posts a message to itself saying, "no, the real mouse cursor is *here*, so act as if that's where it really is
[16:40:47] jimevans: "
[16:40:51] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[16:41:57] jimevans: we hack around that problem by using a child thread to repeatedly send WM_MOUSEMOVE messages to the IE window telling it where *we* want it to think the mouse cursor is. it doesn't take much thought to see where the race condition is here. :)

[16:42:51] qaguy1 has joined #selenium
[16:43:19] jimevans: that change (r17545) made things work more often, but they're not perfect, because of the aforementioned race condition.

[16:47:38] jimevans: but that's just me bitching about the single most painful part of the IE driver, one that there is literally no satisfactory resolution to that i've been able to find.

[16:48:29] Nari114 has joined #selenium
[16:50:38] jimevans: i hasten to add that i'd love to be proven wrong that there's no resolution, but i don't think i am, absent an internal hack that only the IE team at MSFT would be privy to.
[16:56:27] Ardesco: could plug in a robot class to physically move the mouse pointer to the location you want it to be in
[16:56:40] Ardesco: but that would result in only being able to use 1 thread
[16:56:44] Ardesco: and not using the machine
[16:56:48] jleyba has joined #selenium
[16:56:51] Ardesco: and having IE as the top window in focus
[16:58:36] jimevans: well, if the IE window could be guaranteed to have focus, this would be an academic discussion, because we could use the correct API (SendInput) for simulating user input.\
[16:59:28] Bico_Fino: I'm using selenium to login on a page and jump to another, the login part is working perfect but when I change to another page using driver.get() it seems that I have to login again.
[16:59:56] jimevans: but you can't guarantee it will have focus, for two reasons. first, we don't want to, as that's a guiding principle of webdriver. second, it's wrong to have an application steal focus in windows (see any number of raymond chen blog posts on the subject)
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Dec 19 17:00:35 2012]
[17:00:35] Ardesco: to be clear, I'm not saying it's the right thing to do :)
[17:01:35] Ardesco: although offering a command to force the i.e. window to have focus wouldn't count as stealing focus would it
[17:01:40] jimevans: oh, no, having the IE window focused is *exactly* the right thing to do. you just can't get there from here.
[17:02:44] jimevans: because the SetForegroundWindow API, doesn't.
[17:03:25] Ardesco: heh
[17:08:18] Ardesco: is there a way to check if the i.e. window is in focus?
[17:09:54] Ardesco: could SendInput if it is in focus 
[17:10:07] Ardesco: although that does sounds like a bloody horrible bit of code to manage

[19:02:00] qaguy: Hi everyone. Question, is there a know issue about .click not working in IE. I have several places in my script where I use a .click event that works fine in FF and Chrome but not IE. 
[19:02:05] qaguy: known*
[19:02:40] santiycr: qaguy: not that I'm aware of
[19:02:47] santiycr: using WebDriver, right?
[19:02:47] jimevans: qaguy: no, but the IE driver is specifically susceptible to focus issues.
[19:02:50] jimevans: see http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/06/whats-wrong-with-internet-explorer.html
[19:02:51] qaguy: yup
[19:03:10] *qaguy goes to take a look
[19:06:13] qaguy: jimevans: so if native events are to blame can they be turned off and if so how?
[19:06:30] qaguy: o and btw….Darn you Microsoft
[19:06:43] jimevans: yes they can, set the "nativeEvents" capability to false.
[19:06:58] jimevans: however, be aware that running with synthetic events carries a unique set of problems too.
[19:07:10] qaguy: I can only image
[19:07:54] qaguy: is there are page that shows how to set the native events to false?
[19:07:57] qaguy: ie on the wiki?
[19:08:01] jimevans: for example, if your website uses alert() or confirm() in the onclick of a link, your call to WebElement.click() will hang.
[19:08:11] simonstewart: back
[19:08:32] qaguy: jimevans: It does not thankfully
[19:08:35] jimevans: likewise, if the page does hovers with CSS instead of javascript mouseover events, they won't be triggered by synthetic events.
[19:09:10] qaguy: we also use jQuery so when I can i use that instead of the .click from selenium but in some cases I can becuase what I'm clicking doesn't have an onclick even that fires
[19:09:59] jimevans: qaguy: anyway, you set the capability the same way you set any capability for your language binding.
[19:10:28] qaguy: jimevans: thank for the help. As always you are a scholar and a gentlemen :)
[19:11:28] jimevans: though i am neither, it's no problem. :)

[19:31:03] barancev: simonstewart: I want to talk about method getLocationOnScreenOnceScrolledIntoView
[19:31:11] simonstewart: ok
[19:31:16] simonstewart: it's not really a public method
[19:31:30] simonstewart: but we can't expose it the way I'd like
[19:31:35] simonstewart: which is "to selected clients only"
[19:31:38] simonstewart: but go on
[19:31:42] barancev: let's deprecate it in favour of getCoordinates().getLocationOnScreen()
[19:31:58] simonstewart: why
[19:32:00] simonstewart: ?
[19:32:09] barancev: or, may be make it private
[19:32:15] simonstewart: Can't make it private
[19:32:27] barancev: why do we need two ways to get the same info?
[19:32:51] simonstewart: It's there to make implementing an implementation of the Actions based on actual devices possible
[19:33:04] barancev: getCoordinates is here for the same reason
[19:33:05] simonstewart: Notably, to allow someone to do drag-and-drop from the desktop into a browser
[19:33:16] barancev: according to eranm's commit comment
[19:33:19] simonstewart: getCoordinates doesn't give you screen coords
[19:33:22] simonstewart: perkele
[19:33:26] simonstewart: which revision?
[19:33:31] barancev: a moment...
[19:34:03] barancev: btw, getLocationOnScreenOnceScrolledIntoView gives coordinates in viewport :)
[19:34:22] simonstewart: It should do more than that
[19:35:00] simonstewart: Fucking firefox fucking driver
[19:35:08] simonstewart: it never used to fucking do that.

The changes to the wire protocol are not fully implemented yet. | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11008 | http://seleniumhq.org/ci.jsp?r=11008
[19:35:50] barancev: this commit introduced Coordinates class
[19:36:23] simonstewart: Almost a year ago
[19:36:35] barancev: with three methods -- getLocationOnScreen, getLocationInViewPort and getLocationInDOM
[19:36:40] simonstewart: right
[19:37:00] barancev: only getLocationOnScreen is implemented in RemoteWebElement
[19:37:01] simonstewart: Actually 4. The auxiliary often points at the actual web element
[19:37:24] barancev: yes, I mean location-related methods
[19:37:50] simonstewart: The firefox implementation is broken if it's not returning screen coordinates
[19:37:54] barancev: and getLocationOnScreen just calls getLocationOnScreenOnceScrolledIntoView
[19:38:07] barancev: why do we need both?
[19:38:34] simonstewart: OK. So "getLocationOnScreen" is the method from utils.js?
[19:38:45] simonstewart: Imagine I don't have all the context you have 
[19:38:59] barancev: mmm.... I'm talking about Java API only atm
[19:39:12] barancev: why do we need two similar methods in Java API?
[19:39:28] simonstewart: OK. Also, imagine that I've been doing a lot of PHP and Android recently. Spooling stuff back into my head takes time
[19:39:28] simonstewart: OK. 
[19:39:43] simonstewart: Where's "getLocationOnScreen"?
[19:39:49] simonstewart: Coordinates
[19:39:54] barancev: exactly
[19:40:15] simonstewart: So, full method signatures are "Coordinates.getLocationOnScreen" and ...
[19:40:41] barancev: element.getCoordinates().getLocationOnScreen() return the same as element.getLocationOnScreenOnceScrolledIntoView()
[19:40:45] simonstewart: Locatable.getLocationOnScreenOnceScrolledIntoView
[19:40:47] simonstewart: Right
[19:41:02] barancev: why do we need both?
[19:41:03] simonstewart: Now to remember back a year
[19:41:07] simonstewart: OK
[19:41:18] simonstewart: loading...
[19:41:20] simonstewart: loading...
[19:41:23] simonstewart: loading...
[19:41:42] barancev: you want a progress bar :)
[19:42:17] simonstewart: Right. So, getLocationOnScreenOnceScrolledIntoView was designed for the case of drag-and-drop from the desktop on to an element by something implemented using the AWT Robot or similar
[19:42:25] simonstewart: It _requires_ that the element be on screen
[19:42:54] simonstewart: Coordinates.getLocationOnScreen is well within its rights to return "null"
[19:43:01] simonstewart: if the element isn't in the viewport
[19:43:10] jleyba: simonstewart: has anyone implemented that?
[19:43:20] simonstewart: Which one?
[19:43:28] jleyba: AWT robot drag-and-drop
[19:43:32] alexglow has joined #selenium
[19:43:33] barancev: it seems to me that getCoordinates() was introduced as a replacement for getLocationOnScreenOnceScrolledIntoView
[19:43:45] simonstewart: jleyba: the Wave team did
[19:43:50] barancev: but this work was not completed for some reason
[19:44:16] simonstewart: barancev: that was part of the idea.
[19:44:31] simonstewart: But getLocationOnScreen doesn't change the browser state
[19:44:40] simonstewart: …onceScrolledIntoView does
[19:44:42] barancev: atm it does
[19:44:47] simonstewart: On firefox
[19:44:50] barancev: yes
[19:45:00] simonstewart: Which is a specific implementation
[19:45:08] simonstewart: firefox != every driver
[19:45:15] barancev: sure
[19:45:37] simonstewart: Right. Unwinding a little

[19:45:42] rbalent has joined #selenium
[19:45:42] rbalent has joined #selenium
[19:45:43] barancev: ok, then, let's move this method to Coordinates class, for consistency
[19:45:59] simonstewart: ^^
[19:46:02] simonstewart: What are you trying to do?
[19:46:19] barancev: I'm reviewing Java API and I dislike this part. it's smelling :)
[19:46:39] simonstewart: So far better to have that conversation than asking about specifics
[19:46:49] barancev: or may be let's introduce a separate method scrollIntoView ?
[19:47:10] simonstewart: Or make "getLocationOnScreen" force the browser to scroll the element into view if possible
[19:47:15] simonstewart: (the other alternative)
[19:47:16] barancev: that does not do any action on any element
[19:47:59] simonstewart: What about renaming "Coordinates.getLocatonOnScreen" to "Coordinates.getLocatonOnScreenOnceScrolledIntoView"?
[19:48:40] simonstewart: Locatable then becomes a mechanism for getting a coordinates object
[19:48:56] freynaud_ has joined #selenium
[19:48:56] barancev: good idea too
[19:49:09] simonstewart: Which seems saner to me, given the purpose of the methods in the first place
[19:49:31] barancev: actually, getLocationInViewPort should try to scroll too, right?
[19:49:53] jleyba: getLocationOnScreenOnceScrolledIntoView makes me want to barf
[19:49:54] simonstewart: Since it's not used....
[19:49:57] jleyba: from a method name point of view
[19:50:02] simonstewart: jleyba: better name?
[19:50:32] jleyba: Not make it one method
[19:50:51] barancev: or remove the second part
[19:50:52] jleyba: coordinates().scrolledIntoView().getLocation();
[19:51:04] sburjan has joined #selenium
[19:51:05] barancev: click is just click, not clickOnceScrolleedIntoView
[19:51:13] simonstewart: Well, that
[19:51:22] simonstewart: 's because you can click without scrolling something into view
[19:51:23] barancev: scolling is implicit
[19:51:29] simonstewart: (when using JS)
[19:51:35] jleyba: barancev: you often legitimately want to know where an element is in the viewport without scrolling it
[19:51:36] simonstewart: (to synthesize events)
[19:51:42] simonstewart: true
[19:51:43] jleyba: so it has to be an explicit action
[19:52:13] barancev: ok, you're right
[19:53:10] barancev: I'd like to have a separate method srollIntoView()

[20:24:14] barancev: jleyba: on a table with 100 rows and 10 columns
[20:24:39] jleyba: Yes, but calling getText() on which element in the table?
[20:24:53] barancev: jleyba: on the table itself
[20:25:01] jleyba: meh, not a big deal
[20:25:17] jleyba: getText is an expensive operation. users shouldn't use it for things like body or large tables
[20:25:59] barancev: we can use this argument when we don't know how to make it fast :)
[20:27:08] jleyba: figure out how to make it fast then.  you can't use caching - it checks for dynamic visibility constraints that may change between invocations
[20:27:32] jleyba: unless you want to slow down the page with lots of DOM modification event listener
[20:28:37] AutomatedTester: the code is really simple in what it does
[20:28:42] barancev: jleyba: let's consider visibility of a table cells changes dynamically -- what's the value of getting its text at all?
[20:29:21] barancev: while you were getting last row, first one is already invisible and gettext lies
[20:31:11] jleyba: when do you invalidate the cache then?
[20:32:09] barancev: jleyba: it can be a local cache (function-scope map of elements to values)
[20:34:02] barancev: simonstewart: recently I've added CoordinatesTest, and it shows that all main browsers return coordinates in viewport instead of screen :)
[20:35:33] jleyba: barancev: yeah, that might work.  js-maps can only have strings as keys, so it wouldn't be pretty
[20:37:58] barancev: I don't think this isue is critical, too, but if it is easy to fix -- it would be nice
