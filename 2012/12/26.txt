[18:19:21] dogarrhea: so, what does automation and selenium buy us? very little it appears
[18:19:52] dogarrhea: cool you can open a page automatically. is this really so hard to write a script to do that?
[18:20:04] dogarrhea: that combined with the limitations of predicting what the user will actually see..
[18:20:41] stephend: if you don't think it's valuable or don't want to use it, then don't.
[18:20:42] *lukeis <3's some good trolling on a quiet day...

[18:21:36] stephend: well, good for him and you
[18:21:40] dogarrhea: it's more like a q-tip attached to a motor.
[18:21:48] stephend: turns out it's been working for us for 5 years.
[18:21:49] dogarrhea: so much bullshit in automation
[18:22:00] lukeis: barancev: nice ;)
[18:22:20] barancev: dogarrhea: are you visiting this chat just to tell this? :)
[18:22:35] dogarrhea: yes. basically selenium and other automation frameworks are useless for 90% of use cases
[18:22:43] stephend: hahah
[18:23:07] dogarrhea: the "automation architect" here is having major trouble with mobile
[18:23:13] dogarrhea: it just doesn't even work
[18:23:31] lukeis: test automation for mobile is still in it's infancy
[18:23:32] jimevans: great. thanks, alex.
[18:23:50] dogarrhea: yea, since mobile isn't useful or relevant
[18:23:55] dogarrhea: failure to keep up will make it die
[18:24:05] dogarrhea: (the automation framework that is)
[18:24:12] lukeis: yep, mobile is going away…

[18:24:55] dogarrhea: it's so lololol it's bad
[18:25:19] RossPatterson: dogarrhea: If you don't have something constructive to say, please leave.
[18:25:33] dogarrhea: i am providing free qa
[18:25:41] dogarrhea: of this general selenium framework.
[18:25:55] dogarrhea: i have my own custom c# image recognition algorithm for flash black box testing
[18:26:09] dogarrhea: i have yet to find a general use case for selenium
[18:26:35] dogarrhea: won't find CSS bugs. won't automate separate windows nicely. won't automate mobile
[18:27:31] lukeis: take a look at sikuli for css bugs
[18:27:37] jimevans: "won't automate separate windows nicely." "won't automate mobile." pretty vague statements.
[18:28:09] stephend: bunk.
[18:28:20] stephend: and you could always help it get better, ya know
[18:28:41] lukeis: but that would reduce the 'quality' of the troll
[18:29:00] lukeis: ;)
[18:29:31] dogarrhea: stpehnd, like file "pipe error" bugs that don't get resolved for 5 years
[18:29:41] dogarrhea: stability is pretty terrible as well
[18:29:56] dogarrhea: "install the new driver" "keeps happening" "oh well"
[18:30:18] lukeis: open source software is open for anyone to go look at and fix :)
[18:30:40] *lukeis doesn't get that error, so i've never looked into it
[18:32:03] dogarrhea: when the ceo of a company vending selenium has to go off and attach a qtip to a toy from toys 'r us to "automate mobile" you can be sure selenium doesn't automate mobile...
[18:32:49] llaskin: dogarrhea: vending selenium?
[18:32:52] llaskin: what company is selling it?
[18:32:54] dogarrhea: sauce labs.
[18:32:55] lukeis: heh, you know that's a side project and done as 'fun' right? It may have some future, but no one is actually testing like that currently
[18:32:55] llaskin: cuz umm...it's free.

[18:33:47] llaskin: ummm
[18:33:52] llaskin: i have never paid someone a penny to use selenium
[18:34:16] lukeis: you should pay me leo ;)
[18:34:17] llaskin: and perhapps you should take your complaints to the Sauce people...i'm sure one of them is around
[18:34:18] dogarrhea: we're talking about major major major major feature upgrades / stability fixes just to do basic things that any manual QA engineer does
[18:34:19] dogarrhea has been kicked by RossPatterson: OK, bye now.
[18:34:20] barancev: aha! you know how to fix a "pip" bug and want to get money!
[18:34:22] llaskin: lukeis: sure...next year yo uget 2 peanuts.
[18:35:29] lukeis: ahhh, RossPatterson kicked the dog ;)
[18:35:58] barancev: no trolls, no fun...
[18:36:57] RossPatterson: I didn't ban him, we'll see if he returns.
[18:36:59] lukeis: that guy has come in and 'trolled' the room quite a few times (that I've seen in logs)… he'll be back
[18:37:17] llaskin: bug i'm sure hugs was just about to fix his problem right?
[18:37:38] lukeis: he might have gotten a free appibot ;)
[18:37:51] lukeis: to help him with his mobile testing
[18:43:05] lukeis: heh, he starts off on the right foot every time ;) http://www.illicitonion.com:8983/?username=dogarrhea&message=
[18:44:43] lukeis: it should be noted that trolls are a good sign of selenium's popularity, I think I should be shocked we have only gotten so many trolls in irc
[18:45:00] RossPatterson: Point taken.
[18:45:19] RossPatterson: Next time I'll let him blither on and just minimize the window :-)
[18:45:35] lukeis: meh, the trolls deserve kicking

[18:52:24] lukeis: last i heard was to check back on ken's progress at the end of jan / early feb
[18:52:39] jimevans: barancev: the remote-debug-protocol one?
[18:56:20] barancev: jimevans: no, my question is related to the trolling session :) bugs in chromedriver are not even triaged, I think ken is busy working on this new debug protocol, but we want some bugs to be fixed too

[19:13:13] Adam_: Does anyone know of any documentation what would walk me through setting up (importing) the Webdriver bindings in Eclipse for Python. I have been googling for the past 2 hours and can't find anything specific on how to configure. I just don't know how to enable the python scripted tests residing in Eclips access to the WEbdriver bindings. 
[19:18:43] *jimevans looks around for adamgoucher to see if he'll rant on the general uselessness of eclipse (and with python, no less!)
[19:22:44] Adam_: lol - thanks. Will do. 
[19:23:14] jimevans: Adam_: no, don't bug adamgoucher directly, that's not what i'm suggesting.
[19:23:25] Adam_: I understand. i was going to google

[19:25:49] adamgoucher: heh
[19:26:09] *adamgoucher was at the comicbook store so missed the soapbox opportunity
[19:29:05] adamgoucher: but, yes. eclipse is evil. and horrible. and if you need help at that level, you should stay the hell away from eclipse. look at sublime text 2 for a decent editor for python that is cross platform
[19:31:29] qaguy: gentlemen: a quick question. I know that the api for iphone behavior (i.e. touch, double touch) isn't fully available yet. Is their a roadmap timeline when they stuff should be fully supported?
[19:32:00] Adam_: Thanks for the input adamgoucher
[19:32:24] adamgoucher: qaguy when someone needs it and writes it… patches welcome
[19:34:03] qaguy: adamgoucher: Would love to help if I could. It was more a general question if their is a roadmap that is public facing of what it too be worked on over the course or the next 6 months
[19:35:09] lukeis: qaguy: we are more than happy to receive help :) there is no 'roadmap' as it is all volunteer project. I personally see those being implemented sooner (in simulator only) using appium (https://github.com/hugs/appium)
[19:35:55] hugs: ohai
[19:36:07] lukeis: mornin' hugs ;)
[19:36:25] lukeis: your fault for having the same username ;)

[19:37:00] adamgoucher: isnt /everywhere/ in kansas that?
[19:37:04] lukeis: ah, yeah, it's almost afternoon here too… since i'm still in bed it doesn't feel like it
[19:37:40] qaguy: lukies: I am going to "try" and see if I can get one of our devs at my place to download the code and look at it. I am implementing a full Selenium/Rspec/Page-Objects framework for CI where I am. I am hoping that if I can get one of our talented devs to know how the code works when I run into issue we "might" be able to provide patches.
[19:37:47] hugs: adamgoucher: Salina, KS
[19:37:50] qaguy: No promises, but I'm gonna try
[19:37:54] Adam_: adamgoucher - hahah - I can use all the help I can get. I will shamelessly read it
[19:37:55] qaguy: We have a LOt of talented devs
[19:38:23] lukeis: qaguy: cool :) 'patches welcome' is the motto around here 
[19:38:45] qaguy: I know. I love selenium and advocate for it so you don't have to tell me
[19:39:07] qaguy: thanks for the appium heads up.
