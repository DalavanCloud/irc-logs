[00:01:54] simonstewart: Though I wonder whether you need to walk recursively or whether it's just the top level you need to care about
[00:06:32] AutomatedTester: so how can passing a webelement not be a security risk but an object I pass in is
[00:06:47] simonstewart: The element only makes sense on the owning page
[00:06:54] simonstewart: In all other cases, it's nonsense
[00:08:08] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: its more the object we are passing around
[00:08:41] AutomatedTester: hmmm
[00:08:45] AutomatedTester: I need more tests

[10:32:34] selbot2: krosenvold was last seen 5 days ago, joining.
[10:32:38] dawagner: Are you trying to hack in a warning for when something is covered, or are you trying to scroll to fix that problem?
[10:32:42] dawagner: The former is probably pretty easy
[10:35:34] barancev: dawagner: simonstewart said that getText should return "content of child text nodes", and for a text area it is not the same as value property
[10:36:03] barancev: except for IE where typing in a text area changes innerHTML and textContent
[10:36:05] yes456 has joined #selenium
[10:36:40] barancev: is there a community of IE haters?
[10:37:06] dawagner: As a user, I would be surprised if getText sometimes returned the rendered content and other times didn't.
[10:37:44] barancev: it does
[10:38:23] barancev: in IE it returns rendered content

[11:12:21] jarib: dawagner: i'm trying to scroll to fix the problem, but the a warning if it happens would help
[11:12:27] jarib: s/the//
[11:12:44] jarib: a warning would be a good first step
[11:13:44] l3dx has left #selenium
[11:14:19] jarib: we probably could fix this for 90% of cases by scrolling the element we're about to click to the middle of the viewport instead of the top
[11:14:33] dawagner: A warning is pretty easy, I think
[11:14:46] dawagner: Javascript has a method to get the element at a coordinate

[11:54:45] AutomatedTester: thats what Firefox 16 outputs
[11:54:49] AutomatedTester: and that is the error
[11:55:08] AutomatedTester: except now Firefox doesnt give the error because its been there for 2 versions already
[11:55:21] AutomatedTester: the good thing is Marionette doesnt suffer from this

[17:21:24] *jimevans shakes his fist at eranm again
[17:22:45] barancev: jleyba: can you define what should return getText() for 1) a text area that has a default text, 2) the same text area after modification (by typing, and by assigning value property) ?
[17:23:14] jleyba: I already have. getText should always return an empty string for textarea and input
[17:23:17] jleyba: always
[17:24:11] lukeis: .getAttribute("value") for textarea is very non-intuitive :-/
[17:24:53] jleyba: If you change the behavior, you open the door to a ton of bugs about getText not returning properly formatted text b/c we suddenly start including those elements
[17:25:22] *lukeis doesn't disagree, just pointing out we'll have some confusion with users
[17:28:19] kallisti: jleyba: I don't chromedriver is standard
[17:28:25] kallisti: it doesn't use /wd/hub/ as a base path
[17:29:14] jleyba: kallisti: where is /wd/hub in the spec?
[17:29:38] jleyba: base path is never defined.  everything is relative to "some" path
[17:29:44] jleyba: for the java server, it happens to be /wd/hub
[17:29:51] jimevans: kallisti: the IEDriverServer doesn't use /wd/hub either.
[17:30:00] danqa has joined #selenium
[17:31:04] kallisti: thats what I originally thought. a while ago someone pointed me to some literature saying that /wd/hub/ should be used but I cant fine it (and its definitely not in JsonWireProtocol)
[17:31:22] jleyba: kallisti: If you want the chromedriver to have the same signature as the java server, start it with --url-base=/wd/hub
[17:31:49] barancev: jleyba: first, there is not a single driver currently that returns emty string as the result of getText() for a text area
[17:32:40] jimevans: jleyba: oooh. didn't know about that one. IEDriverServer.exe definitely doesn't understand that.
[17:32:56] barancev: jleyba: second, why do you thing it is a source of the bugs?
[17:34:04] jleyba: barancev: Because I spent a week working on the getText implementation and know there are cases we can't handle with that behavior
[17:34:05] kallisti: hm, I'm not sure what I should use a default base path then
[17:34:11] kallisti: currently I have it as /wd/hub/

[17:48:13] goner has joined #selenium
[17:48:21] simonstewart: the contents of a text area are not of that type
[17:48:31] vila_ has joined #selenium
[17:48:31] simonstewart: they're the value of the element
[17:48:48] simonstewart: So "getAttribute("value")" is the Right Thing To Do
[17:48:50] ShawnM: We are implenting selenium grid running in paralell with 1 hub and up to 15 nodes but run into temp file naming conflicts from selenium. Anyone know how to get the naming convention to not increment but randomly generate?
[17:49:03] ShawnM: i have samples 
[17:49:22] simonstewart: There has been occasional discussion about maybe allowing "getText" on a specific element that happens to be of the right type to return the value instead of the text nodes
[17:49:46] barancev: simonstewart: I know that getAttribute("value") is the right thing. the question is different -- what getText() should return?
[17:49:56] *RossPatterson thinks Simon just answered "... why getText for a text field should ***NOT*** be non-empty"
[17:50:14] simonstewart: The concatenation of the TEXT child nodes. Which in a text area is an empty list
[17:50:17] simonstewart: So nothing
[17:50:19] simonstewart: Nada
[17:50:20] simonstewart: zip
[17:50:35] lukeis: except when textarea has default text?
[17:50:42] barancev: a text area can contain child text nodes
[17:50:54] simonstewart: Hmmm...
[17:51:02] simonstewart: fucking defaults
[17:51:13] barancev: you're so right...
[17:51:27] simonstewart: I'm tempted to say that anyone who doesn't know the difference between "getText" and "getAttribute" in this case is asking for grief
[17:51:44] barancev: I don't know the difference
[17:51:52] simonstewart: but then I remember that a lot of our users find it hard to separate "property" from "attribute" in the JS sense
[17:52:01] barancev: I'm asking all aroung and gettnig defferent answers :)
[17:52:17] simonstewart: barancev: getText == concatenating child nodes of nodeValue == #text. 
[17:52:30] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[17:52:41] simonstewart: getAttribute == getting the element property or attribute requested
[17:52:58] barancev: so getText() should be non-empty for a text area with default text, right?
[17:52:59] simonstewart: Which is either "element['propertyName']" or element.getAttribute('propertyName') in JS
[17:53:05] simonstewart: right

[17:55:30] lukeis: geetarista: likely yes (in a few hours)
[17:55:51] geetarista: lukeis: awesome! thanks
[17:56:29] lukeis: are there any browsers that don't treat the default text in a textarea as text nodes?
[17:56:30] simonstewart: So there's an argument to be made for getText returning the value of an element and not its text
[17:56:31] RossPatterson: barancev: So element.getText() == default text always, and element.getAttribute("value") == text entered by user always?
[17:56:55] RossPatterson: lukeis: Not if they're HTML4 compliant.
[17:56:59] barancev: RossPatterson: that's what simonstewart suggests
[17:57:14] simonstewart: That's a very good point, jleyba. An interesting one given the "getAttribute" wars we had before, but consistent with the outcome we had there
[17:57:33] barancev: the real bad thing is IE
[17:57:34] simonstewart: But what about the impact on "getText" when called for a BODY element
[17:57:53] barancev: it changes innerHTML when a user types in a text field
[17:58:07] barancev: in a text area, sorry
[17:58:18] simonstewart: Well, simonstewart, (he says, as jleyba) we could special case getText so that it only returns the value when called on an element, but not if you're calling it as part of a wider parsing
[17:58:18] lukeis: RossPatterson: btw did you run the test-rc? I got a whole bunch of frame is null stuff, why I didn't immediately commit your other patch
[17:58:53] simonstewart: We could, jleyba, but would we want to do that in getText
[17:59:12] barancev: as a consequency, getText is not cross-browser for text areas
[17:59:13] simonstewart: simonstewart, you're a fool. We wouldn't handle that in the atoms. We'd need to do it before calling down to those

[18:00:36] simonstewart: Missed the note. Which one?
[18:00:42] RossPatterson: luke-is: Tried, but got a Firefox failure that seems more like a first-time-tests-ever-run-on-this-machine than patch-is-bad.  I'll try again.
[18:01:12] barancev: simonstewart: IE changes innerHTML when a user types in a text field, unlike other browsers
[18:01:24] barancev: in a text area, even
[18:01:39] simonstewart: Then you're going to end up with inconsistent results when calling "getText", but "getValue" will always Do The Right thing
[18:02:11] simonstewart: Right now, at least
[18:02:35] barancev: I see, the question is do we want this to be?

[18:40:06] lukeis: was just looking for one
[18:40:13] lukeis: and stumbled across that
[18:40:19] simonstewart: :google axfrdns
[18:40:21] selbot2: The axfrdns program - Yp.to: http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/axfrdns.html
[18:40:35] simonstewart: Once you've set that up, massaged the data files and got it working
[18:40:38] RossPatterson: Dan is also the man.
[18:40:57] simonstewart: it should be possible to do a "dig @127.0.0.1 seleniumhq.org axfr"
[18:41:01] simonstewart: And get the BIND congig
[18:41:04] simonstewart: config, even
[18:41:08] simonstewart: The _theory_ is easy
[18:41:13] lukeis: esh
[18:41:15] simonstewart: But I need to set up a chroot environment to do it
[18:41:24] simonstewart: Because tinyDNS expects that
[18:41:30] simonstewart: And I need to be on Linux rather than OS X
[18:41:43] lukeis: what a pita
[18:41:50] simonstewart: My point exactly
[18:42:03] cmack2: Is there a particular content management system that is used for the main Selenium website, http://seleniumhq.org/, or are they individual webpages?
[18:42:37] simonstewart: They're in source control
[18:42:45] simonstewart: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/websites
[18:42:54] barancev: IDEA 12 is out

[18:50:07] lukeis: FalCone: yesâ€¦ webdriver.Chrome  takes a chrome_options  which is webdriver.ChromeOptions

[18:50:26] lukeis: ugh, selenium.webdriver.chrome.options isn't included in the docs :-/

[18:52:59] AutomatedTester: right, where was I with this release
[18:53:05] FalCone: I found an SO question, too
[18:53:14] FalCone: Might just roll with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12698843/how-do-i-pass-options-to-the-selenium-chrome-driver-using-python
[18:54:20] lukeis: FalCone: in that answer "Options" is the same as webdriver.ChomeOptions  (the webdriver/__init__ imports it)
[18:54:41] FalCone: Confirm.
[18:55:07] FalCone: Just have to figure out the flag to get it to grab the .crx I want
[18:55:08] jimevans: AutomatedTester: don't know where *you* are with it. .NET is out. :)

[19:07:05] AutomatedTester: or are you a crotchity old man like simonstewart
[19:07:06] simonstewart: And I'm agreeing, why not India?
[19:07:13] simonstewart: 2013 is in Boston
[19:07:22] Manoj: more number of Selenium users are out here, well known to all. 
[19:07:23] simonstewart: I was a grumpy young man too
[19:07:25] lukeis: AutomatedTester: keep telling yourself that :)  /me may be getting crotchity
[19:07:37] simonstewart: Manoj: you'll notice that no-one's said "no"
[19:07:54] simonstewart: The main thing that decides the location is the people who are willing to help organize

[19:09:02] simonstewart: Manoj: if you think India would be a good place, find the people on the ground who will be doing the venue visits, planning the outings and talking with the hotels
[19:09:08] Manoj: the point is getting In Speakers
[19:09:15] simonstewart: That we can help with
[19:09:25] AutomatedTester: Manoj: take a leaf out of Selenium Camp
[19:09:38] AutomatedTester: you organise and ask people to come, they will more than likely come
[19:09:47] RossPatterson: ^^^^
[19:09:57] *lukeis would be willing to go to india, but would need to figure out who would pay for the plane ticket ;)
[19:09:58] Manoj: Sure, I am up for it. I am ready for volunteering.

[20:04:36] dude-x: woohoo!
[20:04:36] jimevans: andreastt: thanks, mate.
[20:04:41] andreastt: Wait, we haven't even done SeConf 13 yet.
[20:04:43] llaskin: -1
[20:04:47] dude-x: now i can work on synchronizing!
[20:04:59] Manoj: does the downloads page in seleniumhq site is updated with its version to download 2.27 ?
[20:05:01] llaskin: Manoj: no offense dude, but you're the only one afaik...
[20:05:26] andreastt: llaskin: What's wrong with India?
[20:05:27] simonstewart: llaskin: if we can find some europeans to organize we can let the groups duke it out
[20:05:30] Manoj: holy crap ?
[20:05:39] simonstewart: But I've no problem with India
[20:05:40] jimevans: Manoj: not yet. lukeis, aren't we having issues with updating the website?
[20:05:40] llaskin: holy crap as in "interesting idea"
[20:05:51] llaskin: basically expect very few american to attend due to cost/travel time IMO
[20:05:57] simonstewart: Ah. Not "holy crap" "wtf"?
[20:05:59] andreastt: llaskin: My americanlingo sucks (-:
[20:06:01] llaskin: more like wtf.
[20:06:14] simonstewart: Because...?
[20:06:25] llaskin: due to cost/travel time
[20:06:28] AutomatedTester: llaskin: cost/travel is the same as going to Europe
[20:06:39] Manoj: jimevans: even the 2.26 was not updated properly. Still i see 2.25 in downloads page. good to update before some one creates an issue for that. lol :)
[20:06:44] AutomatedTester: well time might be more
[20:06:50] llaskin: time is definitely more
[20:06:56] AutomatedTester: but not cost
[20:06:58] lukeis: Manoj / jimevans: yeah, sehq is not up to date, waiting to switch dns to the new site http://sehq-docs.appspot.com/
[20:07:17] Manoj: I know that 2013 is not done yet,  i have mentioned it as "seems like it would be in Boston."
[20:07:21] jimevans: Manoj: the canonical download site is at code.google.com/p/selenium, not seleniumhq.org
[20:07:28] andreastt: Do we know where in India specifically?

[20:08:07] llaskin: i'm partial to boston too, because its....where I live.
[20:08:12] Manoj: llaskin dont use holy crap in posts of selenium users. All ppl will thin wrong. Though you justify it as "interesting idea" :)
[20:08:22] andreastt: I'd like to go to Boston.
[20:08:24] Manoj: okay.
[20:08:26] simonstewart: llaskin: so your travel times to the conference will average out to "normal"
[20:08:32] llaskin: note that was a post in here.....not in a users list
[20:08:35] llaskin: simonstewart:  hahaha
[20:08:36] andreastt: Besides, the internal travelling costs in the US is nothing. (-:
[20:08:40] llaskin: 0 hours, vs 14+ hours
[20:08:44] llaskin: and i bet my company will NEVER pay fo rit.
[20:08:45] andreastt: So it means I can visit SF after SeConf.
[20:08:50] llaskin: they will pay for my boston conf
[20:08:55] llaskin: mainly cuz I think it might cost me...nothing.
[20:08:58] llaskin: cheap pricks.
[20:09:00] dude-x: most US companies won't pay for international travel
[20:09:02] simonstewart: biab. Heading off for burrito
[20:09:07] llaskin: mmm burrito
[20:09:11] llaskin: carnitas simon?
[20:09:40] Manoj: andreastt: Not sure exactly as of now. Lets the thread at the groups get hotter.We will know. 
[20:09:50] AutomatedTester: llaskin: but if its in India or Europe, your company wont pay for it
[20:09:55] llaskin: true
[20:09:59] AutomatedTester: llaskin: if its in SF your company wont pay for it
[20:10:06] andreastt: Manoj: Yo ushould consider doing it somewhere close to an international airport.
[20:10:09] andreastt: Like Delhi.
[20:10:17] llaskin: nah, they wuld pay for SF
[20:10:18] llaskin: we have an office there
[20:10:29] llaskin: Mumbai perhaps?
[20:10:38] llaskin: i guess i'm not against it
[20:10:43] llaskin: just think its a bad idea
[20:11:12] andreastt: Mumbai could work.
[20:11:14] lukeis: I think i would recommend Hyderbad or Chennai  (tech hubs)
[20:11:15] Manoj: andreastt: offcourse, no need to mention. Most probably it would be in Bangalore, Chennai or Hyderabad (may be Delhi too)

[22:39:04] AutomatedTester: detronizator: I was just joking earlier
[22:39:18] jimevans: Ardesco_H: seen it. my response is still the same. does it happen with the raw wgxpath library? if so, does it happen in the findElement atom? only if those two things are true, is it a problem specific to the IE driver.
[22:40:27] jimevans: i might get a chance to look at it a little later, but thanks for pointing it out to me.
