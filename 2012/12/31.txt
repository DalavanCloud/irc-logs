So I'm putting something like this : Click Link  /path/to/folder but it doesn't works. I'm trying this after a login page and when the is at the Click Link point an other Firefox is open on the login page.

[17:29:18] sfbrian has joined #selenium
[17:33:17] NReijmersdal: cgoldberg: Thanks, wasnt aware they have a free version for OpenSource projects, sounds very intresting.
[17:38:13] cgoldberg: NReijmersdal, yes, it's new.. announced a few weeks ago
[17:38:52] cgoldberg: NReijmersdal, https://saucelabs.com/signup/plan/OSS
[17:39:08] cgoldberg: "unlimited minutes, up to 3 tests in parallel"
[17:41:33] Spanktar has joined #selenium
[17:41:35] NReijmersdal: Yeah, just read up about it, 3 parallel sounds perfect. Working on a framework with Java/Selenium/Cucumber to run tests in parallel, we are planning to OpenSource it when its a bit more stable. Would be nice to run the tests in the open also.
[17:45:31] samphippen has joined #selenium
[17:45:34] dogarrhea has joined #selenium
[17:45:50] dogarrhea: what is the point of having a maven repo for drivers if you still end up having to specify a path to the binary
[17:45:52] dogarrhea: seems so stupid
[17:46:17] RossPatterson: dogarrhea: Welcome back!
[17:46:51] dogarrhea: yea.. still buggy and useless as usual. figured out I can't test on the latest firefox
[17:47:08] dogarrhea: now i'm switching to chrome so i can ge tmore pipe errors but maven dependencies don't resolve jack sh*t
[17:47:27] RossPatterson: The Selenium Project's attitude towards Maven is pretty much "we don't actually care much about it", with certain notable exceptions.  So it gets about as much attention as that would warrant.
[17:47:40] dogarrhea: i have selenium-chrome-driver-2.9.0.jar and the standaloneserver and it's still complainign about "can't find chrome driver"
[17:47:49] dogarrhea: why is the documentation trying to configure it in maven then?
[17:47:58] RossPatterson: You can thank Mozilla for "latest Firefox" issues.  I'll never understand why they update "major" versions that often.
[17:48:05] dogarrhea: so basically, it's clusterfucked everywhere
[17:48:38] dogarrhea: what is the point in even trying
[17:49:10] dogarrhea: all i hear is blame this blame that maven sucks this blah blah documentaiton is good enough
[17:49:22] RossPatterson: I agree.  If you dislike Selenium as much as you seem to, you should stop trying.
[17:50:01] dogarrhea: "it's firefox's fault"
[17:50:10] dogarrhea: "we dont' care about maven even though the docs say to use maven"
[17:50:18] dogarrhea: that's basically waht i hear 
[17:50:28] RossPatterson: Well, it's basically what I typed :-)
[17:51:19] cgoldberg: what are you trying that's so frustrating?
[17:51:33] dogarrhea: cgoldberg. trying to automate on latest browsers
[17:51:39] dogarrhea: firefox 17 not supported
[17:51:52] dogarrhea: mobile not supported. chrome pipe errors.
[17:51:56] cgoldberg: not supported by what?
[17:52:01] cgoldberg: what errors specifically?
[17:52:03] dogarrhea: by selenium
[17:52:12] cgoldberg: i test on firefox 17 and latest chrome builds daily
[17:52:19] dogarrhea: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/selenium-users/ETVMk3mcI6Q
[17:52:30] dogarrhea: i guess you don't read bug reports. i'm having the exact same issue
[17:53:07] cgoldberg: dogarrhea, yes.. that was indeed a problem.. 2.28 works fine for me
[17:53:21] dogarrhea: some reason i don't see it in maven
[17:53:28] NReijmersdal: 2.28 fixed those issue's for me
[17:53:30] RossPatterson: dogarrhea: You need 2.28 for FF17.  See http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/CHANGELOG
[17:53:32] friskd has joined #selenium
[17:54:48] cgoldberg: dogarrhea, sounds like you're not running the latest release.. that's your problem
[17:55:38] dogarrhea: selenium-server-standalone:2.28.0 is not found 
[17:55:44] cgoldberg: dogarrhea, the issue you are referring to was actually fixed in 2.27 i think.. nearly a month ago on 12-05
[17:56:20] cgoldberg: dogarrhea, what are you tring to do specifically
[17:56:29] cgoldberg: don;t just psate random output
[17:56:31] dogarrhea: start firefox
[17:56:32] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[17:56:39] cgoldberg: dogarrhea, how?
[17:56:58] dogarrhea: new Firefoxdriver()
[17:57:09] cgoldberg: dogarrhea, language? framework?
[17:57:26] cgoldberg: dogarrhea, not a mind reader
[17:57:47] dogarrhea: so where is this 2.28 on maven?
[17:57:55] cgoldberg: i don't use maven
[17:58:24] dogarrhea: why do the docs say to use maven
[17:58:44] cgoldberg: perhaps the docs are out of date
[17:59:04] RossPatterson: Looks pretty simple according to http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/UsingWebDriver
[17:59:18] RossPatterson: Either:
[17:59:18] RossPatterson: <dependency>
[17:59:18] RossPatterson: <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
[17:59:19] RossPatterson: <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
[17:59:19] RossPatterson: <version>2.26.0</version>
[17:59:19] RossPatterson: </dependency>
[17:59:21] RossPatterson: or:
[17:59:25] RossPatterson: <dependency>
[17:59:25] RossPatterson: <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
[17:59:25] RossPatterson: <artifactId>selenium-server</artifactId>
[17:59:25] RossPatterson: <version>2.26.0</version>
[17:59:25] RossPatterson: </dependency>
[17:59:35] RossPatterson: (s/2.26/expected_version/*)
[17:59:36] dogarrhea: except 2.28 isn't there
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Dec 31 18:00:09 2012]
[18:00:09] RossPatterson: I see lots of 2.28 at http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.seleniumhq.selenium%22
[18:00:27] dogarrhea: hold on, let me turn on crawler4j to find the most relevant selenium configuration documentation 
[18:01:09] NReijmersdal:  just have: 		<dependency>
[18:01:09] NReijmersdal: 			<groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
[18:01:10] NReijmersdal: 			<artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
[18:01:26] NReijmersdal: And it uses 2.28.0
[18:03:47] cgoldberg: maven looks horrible (i'm not a java or xml fan)... glad I don't use it :)
[18:05:03] RossPatterson: Yeah, Maven is one of those "you'll never have to worry about $PROBLEM again" systems that just makes people unable to solve $PROBLEM themselves and causes other problems.
[18:05:33] *RossPatterson mumbles something about regular expressions and "now they've got two problems"
[18:06:55] dogarrhea: yet for some reason the docs are recommending maven
[18:07:47] cgoldberg: dogarrhea, feel free to update the docs after you get it running
[18:13:21] cgoldberg: dogarrhea, are you trying to use: selenium-java-2.28.0.zip ?
[18:22:32] dogarrhea: yea i'm just adding it in the lib folder
[18:23:01] dogarrhea: Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Unable to bind to locking port 7054 within 45000 ms 
[18:30:55] dogarrhea: guess testing the testing framework is too much work
[18:33:10] dogarrhea: 2.27 only serious?
[18:33:22] dogarrhea: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13803605/unable-to-bind-to-locking-port-70-54-within-45000-ms seems like a regression bug
[18:33:55] dogarrhea: whatever. such a clusterfuck
[18:34:48] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[18:35:40] RossPatterson: dogarrhea: Cut down on the profanity, please.  We're all friends here.
[18:37:48] RossPatterson: Oh, and there's TONS of testing of the testing framework.  You should see how big the automated test set for the Selenium Project is.
[18:38:38] llaskin: RossPatterson: why feeding the troll?
[18:41:16] RossPatterson: llaskin: Because slightly earlier, dogarrhea actually said something that wasn't purely trolling.
[18:46:54] llaskin: wow impressive
[18:46:57] llaskin: that must have hurt him
[18:56:48] RossPatterson: Off to start partying.  Happy New Year, one and all!
