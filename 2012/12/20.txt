[00:21:23] AshShelton: Hey guys I have a question. I'm writing a sort of helper utility for ASP.Net controls using selenium. All of the methods take a webelement as a parameter. The method I'm having problems with causes the page to reload so my reference to the webelement I pass in goes stale. The tricky thing is I'm not sure how to re-obtain the element after the reload as it may not have an id and I don't know its css or xpath location prior to i
[00:24:14] simonstewart: I'd pass in the locator used to find the element in this case
[00:27:20] AshShelton: Hmm that would work but it'd change the signature of my method I could do with trying to avoid if possible. I wonder if it's possible to reverse engineer a css selector from an element, it's the long way round but it means I can continue using my point and click way of obtaining an element and passing it to a function. Trying to build a layer between the user and the selenium code you see
[00:32:58] simonstewart: KISS. Allow the user to pass in a By when you expect the element to change

[00:38:23] AshShelton: I'm one element in the sausage machine, will need to talk to the organ grinder, cheers though at least I know the 'right' way and I can try and get things done like that.
[00:39:22] simonstewart: Yeah, this "I want to reload the element because the element I have isn't the element that exists any more, but it's been replaced by a different element in the same place" thing crops up surprisingly often
[00:39:39] simonstewart: Sometimes I think it's worth putting something elegant in to try and fix this.
[00:39:53] simonstewart: "RefindableWebElement" or some such nonsense
[00:40:10] simonstewart: But every time I do that, I can't help but think we're trying to do something at the wrong level of the stack
[00:47:21] AshShelton: Yeah I see your point, I myself have come across it often enough before, but usually I'm in a position to add an id or I know of the locator so its trivial. It is possible to obtain a css selector for an element using javascript or so my last bunch of searching tells me. Which would make a webelement.getFullCSSLocator method quite possible.

[15:49:38] llaskin: a good answer includes safari
[15:49:38] Phil__: as chromeIE drivers have their own sets of issues
[15:49:56] llaskin: a great answer differentiates between the IDE and webdriver in that the IDE only supports FF

[16:26:45] llaskin: yes.
[16:27:40] eutheria: are you expected to run both if you want firefox, chrome and IE?
[16:29:14] lukeis: the java server starts up the IEDriverServer
[16:29:27] lukeis: no need to replace it… unless you only care about IE

[16:39:21] eutheria: ah the server doesn't recover if you can't find an element

[18:27:51] simonstewart: barancev: if you're going to force tag names to lower-case, make sure you're not in an XHTML doc: case matters in XML.

[18:29:48] jleyba: dont' try to guess, leave tag names as the browser provides it
