[23:20:32] barancev: IE6 misses 2 points
[23:20:45] barancev: also IE7
[23:30:51] barancev: and Firefox scrolling is too aggressive (unlike IE and Chrome)
[23:32:57] AutomatedTester: wow... watching the news right now is making me angry
[23:35:19] llaskin: you seeing the thing in CT?
[23:35:27] llaskin: its a national tragedy IMO.
[23:39:45] AutomatedTester: llaskin: it is a huge tragedy

[23:39:54] AutomatedTester: thats what is making me angry...
[23:40:34] AutomatedTester: people feeling they should have guns because its in the constitution is the problem imho
[23:40:53] AutomatedTester: people should be allowed guns but with a lot of red tape that people dont bother
[23:41:35] llaskin: AutomatedTester: you know I am big on this right?
[23:41:47] llaskin: people do fill out paperwork to legally purchase firearms.
[23:42:13] nhirata has joined #selenium
[23:42:20] llaskin: but perhaps if one teacher was a trained firearms user, or they had armed presence, maybe they could have stopped it from being as bad as it is
[23:42:54] AutomatedTester: so there should be guns around kids under 10?
[23:43:01] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[23:43:48] llaskin: ...under the control of an adult?
[23:43:50] llaskin: sure why not
[23:44:11] llaskin: i'm not saying leave guns laying around..
[23:45:57] AutomatedTester: so instead of preventing people carrying guns when they are obviously not in the right psychological mindset you are suggesting lets let them carry guns AND give another person a gun
[23:46:50] AutomatedTester: I guess school grounds could make good battle grounds 
[23:48:34] llaskin: no i'm suggesting having a trained individual to be there to help prevent these kinds of disasters.
[23:49:05] AutomatedTester: so when a person with a gun comes around they can have a gun battle
[23:49:38] llaskin: would you rather have a gun battle between 2 people?  or have a 1 sided battle?
[23:49:53] AutomatedTester: how about no guns
[23:49:59] AutomatedTester: no battle
[23:50:18] llaskin: the UK has some serious gun laws right?
[23:50:23] llaskin: but last I checked there are still gun deaths...
[23:50:30] llaskin: meanwhile, Israel also has gun laws
[23:50:38] llaskin: but every teacher has an AR15 within close reach..
[23:50:43] llaskin: and there have been (0) school shootings.
[23:50:59] AutomatedTester: there have been 0 school shootings in the UK
[23:51:10] llaskin: http://i.imgur.com/Ts1So.jpg  look at that....
[23:51:14] llaskin: there have been others though
[23:51:24] AutomatedTester: right
[23:51:54] *AutomatedTester gets the figures but its roughly 1 killing per 100000 in the UK 
[23:52:25] llaskin: its not much worse then that in the US AFAIK...
[23:52:26] AutomatedTester: and 22 per 100000 in the US
[23:52:30] llaskin: really?
[23:52:46] llaskin: you're telling me 66k people die from firearms in the US per yera?
[23:52:49] llaskin: i don't believe that.
[23:53:06] rbalent has joined #selenium
[23:54:21] llaskin: wow...wiki says you're pretty close...
[23:54:27] dawagner: llaskin: 3-4/state/day
[23:54:30] dawagner: Doesn't seem unreasonable
[23:54:48] llaskin: today i learned...
[23:54:52] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[23:56:12] AutomatedTester: llaskin: and giving people more guns is going to solve that?
[23:57:10] llaskin: giving trained people, good people, guns, will/should
[23:57:40] AutomatedTester: I am not saying no guns
[23:58:03] AutomatedTester: but if you want a gun you need to do so many hoops that 9/10 people cant be bothered
[23:59:09] dawagner: In this particular situation, I don't think there's anyone who could have had a gun and improved the situation
[23:59:16] llaskin: dawagner: disagree.
[23:59:20] dawagner: I mean, walking in to a classroom and shooting the teacher than then the students
[23:59:28] llaskin: teacher next door has a gun, runs in.
[23:59:32] llaskin: hopefully it helps...
[23:59:34] llaskin: i don't know
[23:59:38] llaskin: we can't armchair quarterback.
[23:59:41] llaskin: but you may be right.
[23:59:56] llaskin: AutomatedTester: trust me, i jump through a lot of hoops to purchase firearms
