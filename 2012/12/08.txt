[00:06:32] ShawnM: anyone know anything about selenium grid and how it determines temp file\dir naming conventions?
[00:15:07] jarib: ShawnM: naming conventions? can you be more specific?
[00:15:08] AutomatedTester: ShawnM: what do you mean?
[00:15:19] ShawnM: sure can
[00:15:29] ShawnM: i have a bug open ont he website i can refer you to
[00:16:38] ShawnM: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4875&can=1&q=shawn%40instructure.com&colspec=ID%20Stars%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary
[00:17:11] jarib: #4875
[00:17:12] selbot2: 03 open/new Selenium grid temp file conflict with multiple nodes using 1 hub on the same box. - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4875 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Status-Untriaged]
[00:18:20] jarib: those look like timestamps
[00:18:41] ShawnM: Cannot create temp directory: /tmp/1354729932160
[00:18:51] jarib: yeah
[00:18:54] ShawnM: the number is a timestamp
[00:19:03] ShawnM: thats what i was assuming since i've later
[00:19:08] ShawnM: setup a dedicated hub to each node
[00:19:11] *AutomatedTester fires up intellij
[00:19:12] ShawnM: havingt he same problem
[00:19:26] AutomatedTester: they look like timestamps
[00:19:40] ShawnM: so temp files/dirs are named by time stamps or perhaps im confused?
[00:19:40] AutomatedTester: why dont we just ask for a tmpdir
[00:22:28] jarib: ah, it's the sessionId
[00:22:34] plightbo has joined #selenium
[00:22:52] ShawnM: i've got some better logs since the bug submission
[00:23:00] ShawnM: that print out threads and tries in the error to
[00:23:06] jarib: the attached log doesn't contain the error, btw
[00:23:08] jarib: afaict
[00:25:07] mreedell has joined #selenium
[00:26:34] ShawnM: the log should include something liek
[00:26:36] ShawnM: Error attempting to start remote webdriver: Cannot create temp directory: /tmp/1354817116178
[00:27:11] ShawnM: so this is more in depth
[00:27:26] jarib: since it's just using the /tmp/<sessionId>, it may very well be that both the hub and the node tries to create this directory, and one of them fails
[00:27:30] jarib: it's not an unlikely bug
[00:27:37] ShawnM: hmm interesting
[00:28:07] AutomatedTester: ShawnM: is it causing issues?
[00:28:15] jarib: actually, you're running multiple nodes on the same box
[00:28:29] jarib: so even if it worked for hub + node, hub + node + node may very well fail
[00:28:35] ShawnM: yes 8 nodes 1 hub
[00:28:40] jarib: why?
[00:28:58] ShawnM: headless xvfb selenium on aws network
[00:29:00] ShawnM: 1 massive box
[00:29:01] jarib: why not have 1 node with higher thresholds?
[00:29:21] ShawnM: our specs see problems on the same display 
[00:29:41] jarib: right
[00:29:43] ShawnM: the specs ran fine running linux to
[00:29:45] ShawnM: windows
[00:29:58] ShawnM: currently on the same iwndows box but not on a shared xvfb display
[00:30:14] ShawnM: so each node has its own xvfb display
[00:30:17] jarib: ideally grid would make it simple to launch a display with each browser, still on one node
[00:30:30] ShawnM: i found that not to be the case :D
[00:30:31] jarib: i actually have code to do this as a grid plugin
[00:30:57] jarib: where there's a separate service that manages a pool of displays
[00:31:11] jarib: but it's on my work computer and not battle-tested yet 
[00:31:46] ShawnM: btw automated tester it isn't causing a direct problem anymore but it sits in loops trying to secure temp resources and gets worse with the more threads that go so its hendering scabaility and slows builds
[00:32:01] AutomatedTester: i wonder if Francois has something like that on his github
[00:32:07] ShawnM: well i can battle test it
[00:33:03] ShawnM: scability = scalability*
[00:33:24] AutomatedTester: he doesnt 
[00:33:39] AutomatedTester: i think he might have something like that at eBay
[00:34:17] AutomatedTester: html5 standard says just add markup you need right, no need for boiler plate
[00:34:35] AutomatedTester: as long as the doctype is right
[00:35:43] jarib: ShawnM: try launching each node with -Djava.io.tmpdir=/tmp/node{1..8}  and see what happens
[00:35:52] ShawnM: i have :D
[00:36:07] ShawnM: and it throws other errors but it was awhile back i'll give it another shot
[00:36:38] plightbo_ has joined #selenium
[00:36:38] jarib: make sure the dirs exist :)
[00:37:31] ShawnM: will do and i'll be on monday maybe i'll hit you up for the plugin you mentioned if that could potentially help
[00:38:04] jarib: sure

[00:46:09] AutomatedTester: I had until 2pm off today and then started work
[00:46:22] AutomatedTester: and then stopped for a few hours around 5
[00:48:06] AutomatedTester: jarib: off to Kiev again next year?
[00:48:30] jarib: maybe
[00:48:37] jarib: i did get an email
[00:48:54] AutomatedTester: i think Ivan is going
[00:51:25] jarib: sort of depends on whether i feel i have anything interesting to speak about, i haven't really been exploring anything in the selenium/web testing space since the last conference
[00:52:35] AutomatedTester: I know that feeling
[00:52:56] jarib: also, march is very close to the launch of the PMO site, i have a feeling i'll be super busy around then
[00:53:29] jarib: on the other hand, would be fun to go back, especially if other committers are going
[00:53:58] jarib: do you plan to go? will speak about marionette probably?
[00:54:11] AutomatedTester: I am not going

[01:00:49] jarib: AutomatedTester: so do you have an estimate for m-day?
[01:00:50] selbot2: M-Day: day in the future when Marionette is made available for non-debug builds
[01:00:59] AutomatedTester: jarib: no :(
[01:01:13] AutomatedTester: we arent feature complete, but not too far away
[01:01:19] AutomatedTester: then stabilising
[01:01:38] AutomatedTester: then looking at opt-builds
[01:02:19] jarib: did jim build it himself?
[01:02:33] AutomatedTester: no
[01:02:40] AutomatedTester: you can play with it in debug builds
[01:02:49] jarib: aha
[01:03:08] AutomatedTester: the "in firefox all the time" part scares security
[01:03:17] AutomatedTester: so I need to add runtime flags
[01:03:21] jarib: right
[01:03:52] AutomatedTester: so if firefox is started with these arguments the user has voided their gaurantee
[01:05:07] jarib: yeah, that'd be fine
[01:05:45] AutomatedTester: oh and profile
[01:06:10] AutomatedTester: so we need to add new profile things, which is easy, and add a new arg to start firefox
[01:07:01] jarib: cool
[01:07:03] jarib: bedtime for me
[01:07:08] AutomatedTester: laters
[01:07:17] jarib: tomorrow is the christmas party at work
[01:07:35] jarib: not sure if this is a scandinavian thing
[01:07:56] AutomatedTester: we have christmas parties
[01:08:01] AutomatedTester: but normally on a Friday
[01:08:15] AutomatedTester: since weekend is normally family time
[01:08:25] jarib: we take it pretty seriously
[01:08:43] jarib: they rented a venue that can fit 1800 people :P
[01:08:46] AutomatedTester: the drnking?
[01:08:56] AutomatedTester: how many people work there?
[01:09:28] jarib: it's an award show, dinner, awards, free drinks
[01:09:31] jarib: ~350
[01:09:59] AutomatedTester: it will feel empty if it can fit 1800 and only 350 go
[01:10:54] jarib: yeah, just the main floor probably, and at tables, not standing
[01:11:31] jarib: excessive drinking with colleagues and then head out into around -20 C
[01:11:45] AutomatedTester: beer blankets to keep people warm
[01:11:45] jarib: recipe for success
[01:12:20] jarib: i bet this is the weekend of the year the oslo police hates the most :)
[01:12:37] AutomatedTester: probably

[12:26:18] pratan:     </div>
[12:26:18] pratan: Else, the page has the following error message.
[12:26:18] pratan:     <div class="error display">
[12:26:18] pratan:                     <span id="MainContent_TabContainerUsageAndCost_TabPanelElectricityUsage_ElectricityUsageView_UCElectricityUsage_lblMesg" style="font-weight:bold;">The account selected has no usage and costs data currently to be displayed.</span>

[13:31:33] pratan: Hi Folks: repeating my ques here --- hoping to get some help.
[13:33:05] pratan: I am using is_element_present (python lib) in order to check if a link is on a page before selenium.click() on the link. However, is_element_present seems to always return true, so the click happens even though the element isn't present. This raises an exception of course.
[13:33:35] pratan: My syntax for checking for the element is:
[13:34:10] pratan: if self.selenium.is_element_present('link=Table view'): 
[13:34:45] pratan: Really simple and straightforward, I think -- how can it have gone wrong?
