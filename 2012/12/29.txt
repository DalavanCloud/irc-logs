[20:07:12] mononofu: is there a way to take a screenshot of a java applet with selenium? (I tried with firefox on ubuntu 12.10 x64)
[20:07:22] mononofu: for me it just shows up blank
[20:09:38] mreedell has joined #selenium
[20:12:20] mononofu: I also tried in Chrome now, and it doesn't work either
[20:13:24] AutomatedTester: mononofu: i dont think you can
[20:14:14] AutomatedTester: I know you definitely cant with Firefox
[20:14:32] AutomatedTester: and if you say you cant with Chrome then there probably isnt any hope
[20:14:43] mononofu: hm, so I'll have to use scrot and do it with a bash script

[23:48:29] jost: Hi! I'm trying to connect to a selenium server on a windows XP machine, which runs in a virtual box.
[23:50:34] rbalent: jost, great, this is one of few ways of using selenium server, is it going without problem?
[23:50:49] jost: rbalent, sry, I'm still typing :-)
[23:50:58] samphippen has joined #selenium
[23:51:12] jost: But when trying to connect, I get the error message "Could not start session. Possible causes are invalid address of the remote server or browser startup-failure or [...]". I've tried all these things (e.g. the machines can ping each other), but the error remains.
[23:51:39] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[23:51:59] jost: Host is an XUbuntu 12.10, Guest is Win XP with IE7
[23:54:28] jost: Currently the remoteWebdriver tries to establish a connection to http://<local ip>:5555, but i've tried http://<local ip>:5555/wb/hub as well
[23:55:14] jost: when trying to open any of these URLs in a browser the connection is reset, so something is there
[23:57:55] rbalent: jost, It is common problem that VirtualBox guest machine is not accessible from host machine and is acting as it is behind NAT. In Settings of Guest machine there is Network settings and if there is NAT selected you should set Port Forwarding and forward the selenium server port. After that you could connect to IP address of guest machine through forwarded port. You can verify if there is something listening on the port with command telnet <guest
[23:57:56] rbalent: _machine> <port>
[23:59:49] jost: there is something listening, but that closes the connection as soon as its opened: Trying <guest ip>... Connected to <guest ip>.Escape character is '^]'. Connection closed by foreign host.
[23:59:58] jost: Network adapter is bridged
