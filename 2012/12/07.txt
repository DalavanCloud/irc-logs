[13:05:34] Manoj: milligan: Can you be more specific..
[13:06:08] Manoj: If I understand your question let me know if this helps....WebElement img = driver.findElement(By.id("foo")); String src = img.getAttribute("src");
[13:06:09] milligan: Manoj, in the source, I will only see <img src="script.php">. In the browser I will see an image.
[13:16:14] AutomatedTester: milligan: AFAIK htmlunit doesnt give us screenshots
[13:16:31] Manoj: milligan: does that solve your question ?  
[13:17:09] milligan: Manoj, I didnt try it yet .. will getAttribute on the src actually get the image, or just "script.php" ?
[13:17:52] AutomatedTester: milligan: getAttribute will get the value in src
[13:17:57] AutomatedTester: so in this case script.php
[13:18:06] AutomatedTester: not the rendered image
[13:18:11] Manoj: you will get exactly what it is scripted....script.php
[13:18:24] Manoj: AutomatedTester: right..
[13:18:42] Manoj: Some browsers return the full URL in JavaScript, even if a relative URL is specified in the HTML source. 
[13:19:19] milligan: Yep. Not much point in testing it then :( 
[13:20:12] milligan: I'll find a way of solving it :)
[13:21:27] testingb0t has joined #selenium
[13:24:24] Manoj: milligan: there are some JavaScript solutions as well.
[13:24:51] Manoj: something like this... WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.xpath("your XPath")); String src = ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("return arguments[0].attributes['src'].value;", element).toString();
[13:25:23] milligan: Cheers.. I
[13:25:29] milligan: I'll keep digging and see what I come up with
[13:25:44] AutomatedTester: Manoj: getAttribute on the src and then do a separate http get for what is returned and then check on that
[13:26:01] Manoj: milligan: Sure, but let us know you got that or not.

[14:31:00] p0deje: hey guys, anyone already tried using phantomjs driver?
[14:31:58] jimevans: p0deje: many, many times. there are lots of hoops you need to jump through to get it working.
[14:32:29] jimevans: the largest one being that, at the moment, you need to build phantomjs from source to get it to work with the driver.
[14:33:12] p0deje: jimevans: I'm particularly interested in its blocking api, the last time I tried it, it didn't block the execution until page load when clicking on plain links
[14:34:12] p0deje: this one - https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/issues/123, guess it's still the same now
[14:34:32] jimevans: p0deje: and it may not now. click() is not guaranteed to be blocking. all webdriver guarantees is that click() will make a "best effort" to block (despite what documentation may say at present)
[14:35:28] p0deje: well, so far all I tried worked flawlessly (firefox, chrome, IE, opera)
[14:36:16] jarib: p0deje: if you build phantomjs from source, you can try it out with the released versions of  selenium-webdriver / watir-webdriver
[14:36:23] jarib: Watir::Browser.new :phantomjs
[14:36:54] p0deje: I've been looking through Selenium integration tests and noticed "block" is not tested (for simple clicks)
[14:37:11] p0deje: is it missed intentionally?
[14:37:13] jimevans: p0deje: again, "best effort". i can virtually guarantee that IE's "wait after click" is less reliable than firefox or chrome

[14:37:15] selbot2: 03 open/new Reuse selenium webdriver - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4783 [Type-Enhancement Priority-Low]
[14:37:55] jimevans: p0deje: let me repeat this so there's no misunderstanding: click() is not guaranteed to block. full stop. period. end of story.
[14:38:19] p0deje: jimevans: thanks for clearing
[14:38:29] jimevans: AutomatedTester: sure, go ahead and close it! :)
[14:39:16] jimevans: p0deje: if you manage to get lucky, great, but you should always be ready to use a synchronization method like WebDriverWait

[14:43:16] Phil___: i thought AutoIT was the only workaround to that
[14:43:32] jimevans: Phil___: nope, because downloading files is usually not a use case you should actually be doing.

[15:41:08] jimevans: i use an exe for a number of reasons. most of them articulated here: http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/11/are-you-kidding-me-ie-driver-another.html
[15:41:28] barancev: no dll loading inside JVM, please!
[15:41:36] jimevans: the tl;dr of that is that process semantics are much better defined in language bindings than .dll loading/unloading semantics.
[15:42:21] kkania: jimevans: can you give a specific example?
[15:42:33] santiycr has joined #selenium
[15:43:15] jimevans: sure. the ruby bindings use the FFI gem to interface with native code, but it doesn't have a method to call FreeLibrary.
[15:43:52] jimevans: also, the 32-bit vs. 64-bit story on windows is much cleaner with a separate executable. 
[15:44:10] kkania: jimevans: is there normally a need to free the library in the middle of the program execution?
[15:44:27] jimevans: a 32-bit process can't load a 64-bit .dll and vice versa, but each can launch a separate process of the other bit-ness
[15:45:33] jimevans: kkania: for the IE driver there was, because of COM marshaling, and because to support multiple instances of the driver, we wanted to insure there was one (and only one) copy of the .dll in process at once, but that it was unloaded when the last active session was closed.

[15:46:17] AutomatedTester: kkania: would the dll have a remote server in it?
[15:46:20] jimevans: you may not have the same issue with the chromedriver, but i strongly prefer a standalone executable.
[15:46:45] jimevans: the 32-bit vs. 64-bit story alone is enough for me to recommend it.
[15:47:13] kkania: AutomatedTester: no, it would just export a simple executeCommand function; if we wanted to have a remote server, we could just have the wd remote server load it
[15:47:29] kkania: jimevans: why did you want to unload it when the last session was closed?
[15:47:47] kkania: jimevans: just for cleanliness issues?
[15:48:01] jimevans: kkania: it's been awhile since i had to think about it, but cleanliness was a factor.
[15:48:04] barancev: from a user point of view: a bug in dll can crash JVM and you lose all the test results, with a separate executable you're safe
[15:48:34] jimevans: kkania: barancev makes an excellent point with that one.
[15:49:05] jimevans: and it's not just the JVM, but any language runtime.
[15:50:21] barancev: AutomatedTester: is #2360 implemented?

[15:50:26] kkania: barancev: can you elaborate a bit more; what do you mean you lost all test results?
[15:50:41] AutomatedTester: barancev: poke lukeis about it
[15:50:45] barancev: ok
[15:50:47] AutomatedTester: I say yes but he says no
[15:50:58] AutomatedTester: well, the last time we chatted about it
[15:51:05] kkania: barancev: you mean later tests will just not be run because you crashed?
[15:51:57] jimevans: kkania: you're running your webdriver code in process with the .dll. that means all of your result information (depending on your test runner) may be in memory, not committed to disk. when the .dll crashes the process, everything in memory goes with it, including your current test results.
[15:52:26] barancev: exactly, JUnit keeps test data in memory until the last moment
[15:52:43] jimevans: nunit works that way. 
[15:54:01] jimevans: also, i find the separate executable vastly easier to debug than an in-process .dll.
[15:54:27] jimevans: but again, you may not need that with chrome drive.r
[15:55:22] kkania: so the main arguments i see for out of process is: 1) bugs in the driver cause larger problems otherwise, 2) you have to release 32/64 bit versions, 3) some languages can't load dlls; any other major concerns you can think of?
[15:57:05] barancev: parallel execution
[15:57:35] barancev: (jimevans mentioned this)
[15:58:01] kkania: you can still have parallel execution with in process though; or what are you thinking about exactly?
[15:58:54] santiycr has joined #selenium
[15:58:56] jimevans: depending on your architecture, users may have issues with debugging webdriver code. in the IE driver, because we were in-proc, setting a breakpoint in c# code would cause execution of native-code threads to be suspended, which made debugging with the visual studio debugger nearly impossible.

[16:01:26] barancev: santiycr: hi! please look at https://saucelabs.com/jobs/6a356c531e984e969fd70e6c264871fb
[16:02:16] santiycr: wow, that's a long test
[16:02:17] kkania: jimevans: can you elaborate a bit more on what was causing the error in 1232?
[16:02:29] barancev: attempts to get url and call window.focus() blocks the test execution
[16:02:39] jimevans: kkania: sure.
[16:02:40] barancev: (this is WDBS test run)
[16:03:11] jimevans: essentially, what happened was that the IE driver was using the mongoose http server, which listened for connections on other threads.
[16:03:37] kkania: the in process IE driver was using mongoose?
[16:03:49] jimevans: when you set a breakpoint in your managed (c#) code, *all* of the threads in the process get suspended, event the mongoose threads.
[16:03:52] jimevans: absolutely.
[16:04:19] jimevans: at the time, the webdriver json wire protocol was the new hotness.
[16:04:32] santiycr: barancev:  where do you see that? I see a click opening a popup, then a call for DELETE window that closes it, then GET url fails because there's no such window selected
[16:04:50] jimevans: and it was the way to get the IE driver to become a subclass of RemoteWebDriver
[16:05:10] kkania: jimevans: ok, i understand then; so there wasn't any binary interface that the driver exported?
[16:05:12] santiycr: oh, I see, there's a POST execute after that, trying to run window.focus()
[16:05:20] jimevans: i talked at length about this at seconf '12.
[16:05:23] barancev: santiycr: I can't understand where these get url and window.focus commands come from
[16:05:35] barancev: I thought it's sauce feature, no?
[16:05:40] santiycr: barancev:  I think the main window needs to be selected and that's why these commands keep failing 
[16:06:07] santiycr: barancev:  definitely not, we don't run any commands in the middle of our users' tests
[16:06:10] jimevans: kkania: it exported a "start the server" and "stop the server" interface, as well as one to query the number of active sessions, but no other binary interface, no.
[16:06:32] barancev: ok, thanks, I'll dig WDBS to find the source of these commands then
[16:06:40] santiycr: except for Se1's captureScreenshot, which we've confirmed doesn't touch the browser or affect the test in any way
[16:06:51] jimevans: kkania: what's the push-back on a standalone executable?
[16:07:02] santiycr: my guess is either we're expecting the driver to select the main window automatically and it's not doing it
[16:07:18] santiycr: or we should have the script select it before attempting to do commands on it
[16:07:23] santiycr: would have to read the spec
[16:07:57] barancev: may be it's something inside WDBS that issues these commands, Ill investigate

[16:08:14] santiycr: sounds good
[16:08:14] barancev: bbl, a meeting
[16:08:25] santiycr: my guess is it's connected to chained tests
[16:08:52] santiycr: one test kills a popup, other test starts from 0 right after it and it doesn't expect it needs to select a new window 
[16:09:12] santiycr: this is why I'm such an enemy of session chaining 
[16:09:32] santiycr: introduces dependencies and conflicts between tests that are extremely hard to investigate
[16:11:56] kkania: jimevans: the arguments I see for using an in process driver is the out of process 1) requires additional http server and converting the http protocol, 2) can be slow to start and stop per test, requiring the user to have to manage a service class, 3) users have complained sometimes chromedriver.exe processes don't get cleaned up, 4) harder to debug because there are multiple processes!
[16:13:07] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[16:13:48] jimevans: kkania: true, but the use of an http server that understands the webdriver json wire protocol is well-understood, with an extracted implementation included in the webdriver tree.
[16:14:05] jimevans: s/extracted/standalone/
[16:14:45] kkania: jimevans: I feel the less code, the better, especially for chromium folk who want to hack on webdriver
[16:14:47] jimevans: (though i made no real effort to make it cross-platform, and would need a minor amount of work to make it so)
[16:15:24] Eleccy has joined #selenium
[16:15:29] jimevans: well, hell, at that point, just use the raw remote debugging protocol from whatever language you want to...
[16:15:42] kkania: jimevans: except that's more code, not less
[16:16:31] jimevans: also, the w3c standard implies that implementers provide a JSON-over-HTTP shim. :)
[16:16:38] kkania: playing with http redirects and extracting parameters from parts of the url and the http request body is a bit ugly; it's simpler to just pass over a request in a function call
[16:17:17] kkania: yes, I was thinking we can just reuse the webdriver remote server and have it load our dll for that

[20:03:36] AutomatedTester: AJ_: no it wont

[20:07:02] Manoj: some one was asking this a while ago, 
[20:07:34] Manoj: HTMLUnitDriver, GRID, parallelism...?
[20:07:35] AJ_: AutomatedTester:really? I thought I read a note from krosenvold somewhere that each findElement uses the port. And yes, I read that page in wiki
[20:07:48] AJ_: I will read again :)
[20:07:58] AutomatedTester: AJ_: once the browser has started you will have a port
[20:08:08] AutomatedTester: that port is bound to the browser instance
[20:08:19] AutomatedTester: we dont create a new port on each find_element
[20:11:10] AJ_: Yes, that was my understanding as well. But then when I read that post, it was saying at full blast he expects around 2000 ports to be used.. I am trying to find that post. will paste it here
[20:12:25] AutomatedTester: AJ_: with firefox we start the browser twice
[20:12:47] AutomatedTester: so that uses 2
[20:13:16] AutomatedTester: and if the OS, especially windows, is slow in releasing them...

[20:26:57] AutomatedTester: ahh so its the opening of a port to speak to the browser
[20:26:58] jarib: every API call is an HTTP request
[20:27:21] jarib: every HTTP request is a new socket (since Firefox doesn't support Keep-Alive)
[20:27:30] jarib: and every new socket is a new ephemeral port

[21:17:17] farlan: I know I know, I just want to try to engage someone who works with the FF driver, as I'm trying to rewrite some of the cookie logic in webdriver and FFdriver
[21:17:36] farlan: half successful so far
[21:17:48] jarib: what are you trying to achieve?
[21:18:04] jarib: why does it need rewriting?
[21:18:18] farlan: I'm trying to modify the code so that it reports httponly flag (success doing so)
[21:18:29] farlan: and to report cookies that are off domain (this is where I'm stuck
[21:19:17] lukeis: i think the browser itself sandboxes cookies, not sure if the plugin space has elevated enough privilege to access *all* of the domains?
[21:19:55] farlan: the webdriver.xpi code has checks in place to prevent returning the cookies that are off domain
[21:20:03] jarib: even if it did in FF, we wouldn't be able to support that cross browser
[21:20:22] farlan: yes I agree thats why I'm rewriting it to work in FF only
[21:20:46] jarib: i'm saying there's a fair chance we'd rather have consistency, than have it at all
[21:21:06] jarib: though i can't remember the previous discussion around this
[21:21:19] farlan: I know, I have heard this many times in this room (I'm mostly a silent participant)
[21:22:01] farlan: but I need to do this for a specific case, and was successful modifying the 2.23 code to return all cookies, but for some reason the latest code does not return the same results after removing the checks
[21:22:11] jarib: so unless you want to maintain a fork, i suggest you take it to the mailing list before spending too much time on it

[21:26:32] runnyspot: is it possible to save a profile with cookies? i'm trying to save time by having login cookie ready to go with tests, but didn't realize you can only add cookies for current domain, which effectively nullifies time savings
[21:26:47] runnyspot: so if i could save a profile via selenium with the cookie
[21:26:50] runnyspot: and then reload that profile
[21:26:54] runnyspot: maybe i could get around this limitation
[21:27:03] runnyspot: is it possible? advisable?
[21:28:27] lukeis: you can launch firefox with a pre-canned profile
[21:28:48] runnyspot: do other browsers support the same functionality?
[21:28:51] lukeis: (which will have cookies… as long as the cookies weren't just for the session)
[21:28:58] lukeis: not really
[21:29:06] runnyspot: right now we are using ffx, but eventually i will move to cross-browser testing
[21:29:14] runnyspot: ok then i guess there is really not a point to any of this
[21:29:23] runnyspot: i'll just have my testcases login to the application each time
[21:29:24] farlan: jarib: https://gist.github.com/4236794
[21:29:25] lukeis: IE will have the cookies there, IE has no concept of profiles
[21:29:53] farlan: this is for the firefoxDriver.js code
[21:30:01] runnyspot: lukeis: i use sauce which has a fresh vm loaded everytime
[21:30:04] runnyspot: so never any cookies
[21:30:16] lukeis: runnyspot: a good way is to 'login' with some http client, grab the session cookeis, navigate your browser to a light page (like 404) then set the session cookie
[21:30:18] jarib: farlan: so when you do the same with 2.27, you're still seeing only the current domain?
[21:30:25] farlan: yes
[21:30:34] farlan: which I find rather strange
[21:30:43] jarib: perhaps a security fix in nsICookieManager
[21:31:13] farlan: well I thought of that too, so I went to the error console and manually typed in the code, and I got all the cookies
[21:32:07] farlan: if you paste: https://gist.github.com/4236805 into the error console you will see all the cookies
[21:32:27] AutomatedTester: farlan: there have been a number of changes to the Cookie jar in Firefox because of Firefox OS
[21:32:28] jarib: that is odd, did you try to add some logging to your modified firefoxDriver.js to make sure it's actually being used?
[21:32:34] AutomatedTester: we have tightened things up
[21:32:55] farlan: how so AutomatedTester?
[21:33:04] jleyba: farlan: you're wanting the FirefoxDriver to return cookies not visible to the current domain?
[21:33:14] jarib: farlan: it could all be that the extension has different privileges vs the error console
[21:33:17] jarib: s/all/also
[21:33:35] farlan: good point jarib
[21:34:08] farlan: jleyba: yes, I'm trying to modify the source to return all the cookies as seen on the current page, regardless of domain of origin
[21:34:11] friskd has joined #selenium
[21:34:24] jleyba: farlan: for a custom build then?  That's against the webdriver spec
[21:34:38] AutomatedTester: farlan: with the way Firefox OS works we needed to limit actions with cookies
[21:34:48] AutomatedTester: especially around frames etc
[21:34:48] farlan: yes custom build
[21:35:12] AutomatedTester: since each app runs on the same window but in different iframes
[21:36:55] plightbo has joined #selenium
[21:37:50] farlan: AutomatedTester: basically what I'm trying to achieve is something similar as going into the options->privacy->cookies FF setting, which I managed to get working with 2.23 and FF12, but now that I have upgraded to 2.27 and FF17, the same set of changes no longer works.
[21:39:57] plightbo_ has joined #selenium
[21:40:56] AutomatedTester: yea, I thinks its because we made changes to cookie jars in Firefox for Firefox OS
[21:41:32] AutomatedTester: options->privacy->cookies  is running in a very highly priviledged area
[21:41:53] AutomatedTester: extensions dont have that type of access

[21:46:45] farlan: yes, but that is a very slow process in comparison
[21:46:55] farlan: FF stores the cookies in a SQLite file
[21:47:10] farlan: but I have to wait for FF to sync memory contents into the file before I can read it
[21:47:27] lukeis: slow & working is better than not at all ;)
[21:48:01] farlan: agreed, but I'd like an elegant solution ;)
[21:48:26] farlan: can you point me in the direction of the cookie jar?
[21:49:26] farlan: is that org.openqa.selenium.Cookie?

[21:50:08] farlan: ah

[22:02:06] jarib: couldn't be!
[22:02:10] lukeis: then who?
[22:02:48] jarib: nirvdrum stole the cookie from the cookie jar!
[22:03:09] nirvdrum: What'd I do?

[22:05:02] plightbo: just got a text from my wife, regarding my 14 month old daughter: "Maggie has taken her pants off twice today". Just thought I'd share that :P
[22:05:31] AutomatedTester: plightbo: potty training?
[22:05:32] nirvdrum: lukeis: Uh huh.
[22:05:51] lukeis: 14 months? little early
[22:06:07] jarib: AutomatedTester: i was just about to reveal that i used google and was somewhat flattered that lukeis assumed i knew it :)
[22:06:08] plightbo: AutomatedTester: we are barely starting. i'm guessing it's more like she's just goofing around :P
[22:06:25] AutomatedTester: oh wait... pants == trousers

[23:01:49] stephend: something's up on our side, even with 2.26.0
[23:07:45] lukeis: stephend: you could always patch Se to have the host ip in the session id ;)  (iWebDriver does it that way…)

[23:34:03] jarib: don't think i've been this devops buzzword compliant in a long time

[23:37:54] AutomatedTester: jarib: whats next for you?
[23:39:00] AutomatedTester: The feeling where you realise you over engineered a solution
[23:39:11] jarib: who knows, enjoying working on this quite a bit
[23:40:01] jarib: i also have a pretty flexible deal at work, could easily cut down if/when they're able pay me to work on this site
[23:40:25] AutomatedTester: I have this crazy idea, and it is crazy and liberal, but wouldnt it be awesome to do "code for america" style thing but for any government
[23:40:43] *AutomatedTester would be jealous of Jarib's deal at work if he didnt have a 9-5
[23:40:54] AutomatedTester: s/didnt/did
[23:41:08] *AutomatedTester goes back to work 
[23:42:36] *AutomatedTester cant wait till his kids are a little older, I want to help out at http://www.codeclub.org.uk/
[23:42:52] jarib: i believe mysociety (the people behind http://theyworkforyou.com) are aiming to do exactly that, build some more generic systems for government transparency / civic hacking projects
[23:44:43] AutomatedTester: oh wow
[23:44:51] AutomatedTester: my crazy idea isnt so crazy
[23:45:45] AutomatedTester: ok, my solution wasnt over-engineered
