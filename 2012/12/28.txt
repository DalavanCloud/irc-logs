[14:55:32] llaskin: it seems webdriver is not properly attaching to firefox...
[14:55:46] llaskin: there is no little "WebDriver" text in the bottom right hand corner of FF either
[14:55:51] llaskin: adamgoucher: making you blink
[14:56:32] *adamgoucher blinks .. then goes back to his deadlineâ€¦ back in 20 minutes
[14:59:34] llaskin: also in an unrelated question:  What would cause a webdriver instance to load, but then never navigate to *any* page...just sit there as if it had just been started and not proceed further
[14:59:48] llaskin: this happens *sometimes* with no predictable cause other then it seems having multiple ff instances happening at once?
[14:59:51] Mox[NL]: llaskin: maybe loading the extensions takes longer then 60 seconds?

[15:09:52] RossPatterson: Sorry, no.  Sounds like a language-binding issue to me.  Unless, of course, you're using a Firefox version that Selenium 2.21 doesn't support.
[15:11:06] llaskin: that might be it
[15:15:19] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: hey, how strong is your css-fu?
[15:15:30] nirvdrum: Reasonably.
[15:15:55] AutomatedTester: is there an equavilent to :target that uses name/css classes?
[15:17:26] nirvdrum: Eh?  What are you looking to do?
[15:18:39] AutomatedTester: make some DOM visible without any JavaScript. e.g. https://github.com/getinthehabit/core/blob/master/www/css/habitual.css#L79
[15:19:16] AutomatedTester: that uses :target to make the element visible
[15:20:03] AutomatedTester: means I can make elements visible/invisible without having to use JavaScript
[15:20:08] nirvdrum: Right.
[15:20:42] AutomatedTester: but now I want to have a number of elements change based on the the hash in the URL
[15:21:01] AutomatedTester: but its not valid HTML to have an id multiple times
[15:21:21] nirvdrum: Gotcha.
[15:21:48] AutomatedTester: so want to use name/class
[15:21:56] nirvdrum: You're already using a sibling selector.  Can't you work out a hierarchy that'll get you what you want?
[15:22:10] nirvdrum: Otherwise, sorry, I don't have any clue.
[15:22:37] AutomatedTester: I tried some sibling locators already
[15:22:47] AutomatedTester: maybe my selector was rubbish
[15:32:12] jimevans has joined #selenium
[15:33:05] kallisti: AutomatedTester: XPath?
[15:33:13] kallisti: oh CSS selector
[15:33:15] regex: I have a question about finding descendents using CSS as a library method.
[15:33:26] kallisti: regex: go ahead
[15:33:38] AutomatedTester: kallisti: how would I use XPATH in a stylesheet?
[15:33:52] kallisti: AutomatedTester: ah, thought you were using selenium
[15:36:16] regex: I wrote this library method for using CSS to find any element that matches the variable inner text.  What CSS would I then use for descendents or siblings?  https://gist.github.com/4398929
[15:37:02] regex: Morever, would it work within my current construct there? :) 
[15:38:09] kallisti: AutomatedTester: as far as I know :target should be sufficient for any target element
[15:38:15] jimevans: regex: please note that your selector is not standard. the :contains psuedo
[15:38:29] AutomatedTester: kallisti: :target only works on id of elements
[15:38:56] jimevans: the :contains pseudoselector isn't part of the standard, and there is no way to select based on text content using css selectors.
[15:39:13] kallisti: AutomatedTester: oh, you mean you want the fragment identifer (the # thing) to refer to a name/class?
[15:39:15] jimevans: the jquery bastardization of the css selector standard (aka sizzle) supports it.
[15:39:31] jimevans: but not the w3c standard, and that's what webdriver supports.
[15:39:32] AutomatedTester: kallisti: yup
[15:39:52] kallisti: AutomatedTester: as far as I know .class :target is sufficient to specify that the element should be of a given class and also the target. but yeah, the URI fragment needs to be the ID. so I don't think what you want is possible.
[15:40:09] kallisti: other than via duplicate id's, as you said.
[15:40:29] jimevans: regex: also, you should not use the "css=" prefix when using the webdriver By.CssSelector. that's confusing rc locators with webdriver.
[15:43:25] regex: Thanks jimevans.  How about CSS for finding siblings or descendents within that?
[15:43:28] kallisti: AutomatedTester: personally I would use whatever server-side language you're using to handle it for you. Javascript would be an okay alternative, but if I can do something server-side instead of client-side I usually take the opportunity.
[15:43:39] kallisti: regex: element + sibling
[15:43:41] kallisti: IIRC
[15:43:47] kallisti: that's right-sibling only though
[15:44:12] kallisti: (right-sibling is /not/ the correct term. :P)
[15:44:15] jimevans: regex: descendants are easy. use element.FindElement().
[15:47:52] kallisti: regex: or, you know, parent > child
[15:48:50] kallisti: (though what jimevans' suggests is sometimes necessary, when you can't use CSS selectors (such as when you need to match on the substring of a text node))
[15:49:48] regex: So I literally just call the method FindElement() and all descendents are displayed as a list? 
[15:50:06] kallisti: not quite. for that you would want to use t he * CSS selector
[15:50:13] AutomatedTester: kallisti:I dont understand how server-side would help me with making DOM elements visible
[15:50:24] kallisti: note that this is a method on the Element class, not RemoteWebDriver (or whatever it's called in Java)
[15:50:40] kallisti: AutomatedTester: you want it to be visible on a particular # fragment. that's static right?
[15:50:44] AutomatedTester: I have got it working by the way
[15:50:50] AutomatedTester: yes
[15:51:12] kallisti: so... there you go.
[15:51:22] AutomatedTester: I got it working with pure css
[15:51:35] kallisti: AutomatedTester: cool. but how? if I might ask.
[15:51:41] AutomatedTester: but I dont understand why doing a call all the way to a server would be better
[15:51:51] jimevans: regex: no, you still need to provide find criteria. in CSS, that'd be By.CssSelector("*")
[15:51:57] AutomatedTester: I got my css selector fixed and added some more html
[15:52:22] kallisti: AutomatedTester: I was just operating under the assumption that a server-side language is being used, so it's not really an "extra" call, per se, since you would be doing it anyway
[15:53:24] AutomatedTester: kallisti: browsers dont load the page from the server for an anchor tag
[15:53:31] AutomatedTester: they just move to that part
[15:53:52] kallisti: ah right. if you're moving from the same page to a fragment.
[15:53:59] AutomatedTester: yea
[15:54:04] kallisti: which, is... common. :P
[15:54:23] jimevans: regex: my favorite go-to quick reference for css selectors: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize/
[15:54:49] AutomatedTester: kallisti: let me commit the fix and you can see
[15:55:37] kallisti: are fragment identifiers even sent across HTTP?
[15:56:05] kallisti: and if so, I wonder if there's any standard specifying that it's okay not to send a second request if the fragment identifier is added/changed
[15:58:52] AutomatedTester: kallisti: https://github.com/getinthehabit/core/commit/dcbeb4752faacdaaf97cfbaa8a5ae0315216ca80

[16:00:07] AutomatedTester: so when #taskcontainer is in the URL it will show the inputs
[16:00:34] kallisti: but you still have to use the ID of the element in the fragment identifier, yeah?
[16:01:09] AutomatedTester: yea, I am using the ID of the overall parent
[16:01:25] AutomatedTester: and then the class of the other elements
[16:01:30] kallisti: ah okay
[16:01:57] kallisti: "get in the habit" sounds like some bad comedy about nuns 
[16:03:04] AutomatedTester: :)
[16:03:49] lukeis has joined #selenium
[16:04:49] regex: Those CSS selectors are still a bit vague to me.  So if I wanted to find all checked radioboxes with a CSS selector.  Would I use something like this?  (this will help me put the CSS selector code together)
[16:05:39] regex:  driver.FindElements(By.CssSelector(input[type=radio]:checked);
[16:05:53] lukeis: I think "input[type='radio'][checked]" is what you want
[16:05:58] kallisti: yes
[16:06:05] kallisti: lukeis++
[16:06:33] regex: Okay, so now I now how to put that code into the parameter of the method.
[16:06:37] kallisti: :checked would also work though
[16:06:58] lukeis: in all browsers?
[16:07:05] kallisti: but :checked is a pseudo-class whereas [checked] is an attribute selector
[16:07:19] kallisti: lukeis: not in IE apparently
[16:07:39] kallisti: in all versions of firefox, chrome, and Safari > 3.1
[16:08:12] lukeis: yeah, didn't remember that one in the css 3 spec, sure enough there it is ;)

[16:08:29] kallisti: if it makes you feel better, I looked it up too. :D
[16:09:40] kallisti: actually [checked] might select both checked and unchecked
[16:09:50] kallisti: since you're only asking if the checked attribute is defined
[16:10:15] kallisti: ah nevermind
[16:10:23] lukeis: ;)
[16:10:30] kallisti: since it's boolean "unchecked" is "not set"
[16:11:59] kallisti: I will never keep all the various meanings of true, false, unknown, undefined, and null straight between all the different semantic models I deal with. :P
[16:12:33] regex: Do you guys prefer interfaces or abstract classes for base objects?
[16:13:00] kallisti: assuming "none of the above" is not a valid answer, interfaces. 
[16:13:09] adamgoucher: i prefer languages where i dont have to make that choice :)
[16:13:17] lukeis: depends, if there's reusable code to put in the abstract classe, otherwise interfaces
[16:14:18] lukeis: then again most of the time i'll just make them concrete objects to extendâ€¦ 
[16:17:20] kallisti: most languages either have "multiple inheritance" or "single inheritance with multiple interfaces", so the choice is usually pretty straightforward.
[16:17:32] stephend has joined #selenium
[16:18:00] kallisti: and in most multiple inheritance languages an interface and an abstract base class are the same thing.

[16:23:22] megharsh has joined #selenium
[16:26:24] regex: Here's a question.  You guys use page object models.  But what about using a Model View Controller logic. 
[16:26:49] regex: Whereby you place the page object model in the Model segment.  All logic goes into the controller.  The actual tests go into the view segment.
[16:27:16] regex: The architecture could be easily segmented this way.  Thoughts?
[16:27:41] lukeis: the 'logic' / controller part doesn't make much sense in testingâ€¦ otherwise you'll really have to test your tests ;)
[16:28:04] regex: Why not test the tests of the tests? :) 
[16:28:06] lukeis: test cases should know exactly what is going on and what should happen
[16:28:15] lukeis: you certainly can / should in some cases
[16:28:45] regex: Well seriously though.  For me the MVC makes a ton of sense.  
[16:29:00] lukeis: the idea of code figuring out logic of a system adds complexity and is 're-implementing' the application under test
[16:29:27] *lukeis has fallen into that trap before...
[16:29:56] kallisti: wouldn't the tests be the controller in this case?
[16:30:25] lukeis: yeah, and there is no view ;)
[16:30:41] qaguy: Hey guys. There is a patch attached for #4876. Would it be possible for someone to review that patch. Its a pretty bad Firefox issue.
[16:30:42] kallisti: stdout is your view, unless you're using some kind of GUI/web interface. :P

[16:30:56] regex: I have a Base Object > RadioButton with methods on the radio button like: Exists, Visible, Descendent, Sibling, Child, IsSelected
[16:31:17] regex: All that goes into the controller.  So when you're in a test (from the view).  You can just go RadioButton.Exists();  
[16:31:34] jleyba has joined #selenium
[16:32:04] regex: The view is the actual display or actual physical tangible part of your test application.  
[16:32:20] regex: It would make sense then that it's the actual test. 
[16:32:59] regex: I might try it out.  I don't want it to be challenging for others to pick up my architecture though.  I want it to be totally intuitive.  That's why I'm asking.
[16:33:21] *lukeis would not recommend it :)
[16:33:26] kallisti: uh oh, I'm falling behind on maintaining the most cutting edge third party webdriver library. 
[16:33:31] kallisti: I need to implement those required capabilities.
[16:33:48] regex: Thanks for your information and counter argument lukeis :) 
[16:34:08] kallisti: and... probably some other features I'm forgetting. I don't think I made a list.
[16:34:17] *kallisti best maintainer.
[16:34:40] lukeis: do required capabilities 'work' fully?
[16:34:50] jleyba: no
[16:34:59] *lukeis didn't think so
[16:35:01] jleyba: they are yet another feature implemented in firefox only
[16:35:15] kallisti: ah.
[16:35:33] lukeis: it will be nice when marionette takes over and we can't just monkey patch the API
[16:35:54] lukeis: mday ;)
[16:35:54] selbot2_: M-Day: day in the future when Marionette is made available for non-debug builds
[16:36:06] kallisti: it'll be a total pain to implement anyway, so I'll put it off until it becomes not-so-bleeding-edge.
[16:36:16] jleyba: it would be nice if people would implement new features in more than one browser before moving on
[16:36:17] AutomatedTester: you will still be able to monkey patch marionette
[16:37:40] kallisti: well, actually it won't be too bad to implement.
[16:38:34] alexglow has joined #selenium
[16:39:05] kallisti: it /will/ however make my documentation even more confusing than it already is].
[16:42:49] lukeis: don't worry kallisti, i don't think required capabilities are in python nor ruby ;)
[16:43:21] kallisti: they aren't
[16:43:28] jleyba: they're not in js :)
[16:45:11] AutomatedTester: TIL I learnt the spanish equivalent of April Fools is today

[16:45:27] lukeis: s/still//
[16:46:18] jleyba: that's not promises.  that's dirty continuation passing
[16:46:55] jleyba: FWIW, I'm about half way completely overhauling the documentation for the js-bindings.  Will submit it along with an update to the bindings themselves (got a handful of features I'm working on)
[16:46:56] lukeis: so it is..
[16:47:27] jleyba: now that the SafariDriver is "done," I have time to work on the js bindings again
[16:47:28] lukeis: cool, can you update the example on SeHQ (chapter 03) too?
[16:47:39] jleyba: how do I do that?
[16:47:43] AutomatedTester: wd.js doesnt use promises iirc

[20:38:04] jimevans: or, alternatively, RadioButton.Exists shouldn't be static.
[20:38:50] jimevans: if many controls would implement the Exists() method in the same way, that screams out for a base class implementation, rather than a static implementation.
[20:39:09] jimevans: (admittedly, i'm jumping in late here, so i don't know the full impact of what i'm suggesting)
[20:39:09] regex: I originally developed this as an abstract class.  I felt like I could implement .Exists directly from the base object and therefore an Interface owuld be useful.
[20:39:59] jimevans: if you're using a base class, why bother with an interface?

[22:37:19] lukeis: nice work btwâ€¦ well, if I could actually understand the c++ code, I pretended to in my head when i looked through it
[22:37:58] lukeis: i like glorious hacks
[22:38:17] jimevans: ugh. what a fuckin nightmare
[22:43:43] jimevans: can't use frameElement to get the element hosting a cross-domain frame, but we have a hack (not available to javascript clients) to get the parent document, even though it's cross-domain. from the parent document, we grab the nth iframe or frame (whichever is found), where n is the index into document.frames that corresponds to the child frame.
[22:43:45] jimevans: bleah.
[22:44:00] jimevans: all because you can't disable cross-domain frame access.
[22:47:16] lukeis: yay frames
[22:50:22] qaguy: frames are the bane of a testers existence
[22:50:40] lukeis: and a UI developer ;)
[22:50:47] qaguy: indeed
[22:51:45] regex: I may be pushing my luck today.  But one last question...
[22:51:59] regex: How can I shorten the repository name without error?  http://picpaste.com/repositoryinstance-4Pk0JyWy.JPG
[22:53:46] lukeis: looks like a very specific c# questionâ€¦ my stab in the dark here, you need to do using and namespacing?
