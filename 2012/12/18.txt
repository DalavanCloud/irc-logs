[14:38:33] mrpotatoes: I'm using this code to try to get some ajax content that shows up on the page (a div pops up and goes away). https://gist.github.com/4328529. This is the stack trace that I'm getting: https://gist.github.com/4328521. My class is Featured. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I worked on this all day yesterday.
[14:44:20] Ardesco: a stack trace with no code doesn't give us much to work on
[14:44:34] mrpotatoes: The code is in the first link: https://gist.github.com/4328529
[14:44:39] Ardesco: aha my bad
[14:44:40] Ardesco: :)
[14:44:55] Ardesco: which browser?
[14:44:56] mrpotatoes: yikes, I don't know what gist did to the formatting :=/
[14:45:06] mrpotatoes: Doing this in firefox.
[14:47:01] Ardesco: so you want to find the element that appears?
[14:47:55] mrpotatoes: Yeah. It's a div that is added to the DOM dynamically and I want to find that element then do things with the data therein.
[14:48:36] Ardesco: I would try with WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver)
[14:48:37] Ardesco:         wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.cssSelector("#autocomplete div.reference-autocomplete:first")));
[14:49:22] mrpotatoes: I tried that as well as I prefer to get a return but that didn't work either. Let me try again. Just to be completely sure
[14:50:51] Ardesco: the second line will return the WebElement
[14:51:28] Ardesco: so you could do: WebElement myElement = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.cssSelector("#autocomplete div.reference-autocomplete:first")));
[14:52:21] mrpotatoes: Yip, that's exactly what I'm doing: http://pastebin.com/FHPrigA2
[14:52:40] mrpotatoes: Except I get a complaint about line 63 (wait.until)
[14:52:54] mrpotatoes: Invalid or illegal string. Is my selector bad?
[14:53:15] mrpotatoes: It looks just fine to me. This really is frustrating to me.
[14:53:25] fatguylaughing has joined #selenium
[14:57:36] mrpotatoes: I think it's the ':first". I changed it to :nth-child(1) and I don't get that error anymore. 
[14:58:15] Ardesco: STRANGE, FIREFOX SHOULD SUPPORT :FIRST
[14:58:18] Ardesco: oops caps
[14:59:03] Ardesco: you could just change it to #autocomplete div.reference-autocomplete
[14:59:24] Ardesco: selenium will grab the first one it finds anyway

[16:29:27] selbot2_: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[16:29:29] floppyears: I use the selenium ide to have people easily record their test cases. I have spent several hours trying to get the selenium-standalone jar to run a test suite.
[16:29:54] floppyears: I'm running into this bug: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1759 . 
[16:30:01] floppyears: Does anybody have suggestions on how to get around it?
[16:30:21] danqa: llaskin: My code is using page object classes and the like. I would have to make a test case for you to look at.
[16:30:49] jimevans: danqa: you haven't mentioned what browser you're seeing this in, but i'm going to use my psychic debugging powers to guess you're seeing it in firefox.
[16:31:20] danqa: jimevans: You are correct o oracle
[16:31:32] danqa: Sorry should have been more specific
[16:31:44] llaskin: note that there are no changes being made in RC anymore floppyears.
[16:32:01] llaskin: does it happen at the same place everytime?
[16:32:15] danqa: llaskin: no different places
[16:32:20] floppyears: llaskin: so what is the suggested route? Should I be discouraging people from using selenium ide in firefox to record their test cases?
[16:33:05] llaskin: yep.
[16:33:11] danqa: The reason I suspect its frame focus is that our App uses jQuery which I use in my scripts as well. I am in the frame and using jQuery fine then all of a sudden jQuery doesn't exist.
[16:33:12] llaskin: tell them to learn how to code.
[16:33:30] danqa: I know it does exist and I verify that in the console.
[16:33:43] llaskin: so what happens if you manually run your test via IRB?
[16:33:47] llaskin: does it still cause issues?
[16:33:54] *jimevans mumbles something along the lines of, "test automation is coding, and anyone doing it should learn to code."
[16:34:18] danqa: llaskin: how would I run it via IRB?
[16:34:29] danqa: excuse my igorance
[16:34:33] danqa: never done that
[16:34:39] floppyears: llaskin: is converting from html test suites/cases to webdriver or webdriver backed supported?
[16:34:56] llaskin: no IMO it's not
[16:35:02] llaskin: it takes some time.
[16:35:10] llaskin: danqa: so open a command line
[16:35:16] llaskin: then type 
[16:35:17] llaskin: "irb"
[16:35:22] llaskin: then line by line cut and paste your script in

[16:54:42] jimevans: i could see a case being made that if you're trying to bring along a large number of "non-programmers" a dynamic language like python or ruby might be a good choice, because you don't have the dual learning curve of language and tooling.
[16:55:09] floppyears: what docs/sites did you guys use to get started with the selenium2 and the new way of doing things (with rc no longer being supported)?
[16:55:14] lukeis: and i would say that the dev's maintaining the site *need* to also help maintain the tests
[16:55:18] dhpe: i mean it's the most popular programming language. and selenium tests are interacting with the frontend, and only under the hood with the backend.
[16:55:25] floppyears: I'm assuming htmlSuite is no longer recommended.
[16:55:29] jleyba: our javascript bindings also aren't as mature as the other languages
[16:55:45] lukeis: (but with more users they likely will be jleyba)
[16:55:51] RossPatterson: I've written WebDriver-based tests in C# and Python, and while I'm learning to love the ease of ad-hoc stuff in Python, the C# interface is more rigourous, due in part to the language's type-safety requirements.
[16:56:10] lukeis: floppyears:  http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html
[16:56:35] lukeis: and then read :wiki pageobjects

[16:56:56] jimevans: floppyears: in the interest of full disclosure, i have to warn you that the advice you'll get in this channel will be strongly biased against selenium IDE specifically, and against record/playback in general. that advice *may* not fit your specific situation.
[16:57:35] jleyba: +1 ^
[16:57:37] jimevans: RossPatterson: i dig c#. :)
[16:57:49] RossPatterson: dhpe: The TIOBE index still shows C as the most popular language, with Java and C# coming in close behind.  JavaScript is way down at #12.  In fact, all the other WebDriver languages are ahead of JS. (http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html)

[17:00:01] jimevans: RossPatterson: is there anything you find particularly missing or lacking in the .NET API? i think functionality is solid and won't change much, but i'm all for tweaking the API to make it more usable.
[17:00:11] RossPatterson: There was once a good reason to prefer Java over all other languages - all new feature development in Selenium and WebDriver began in Java, and other languages caught up (or not) afterwards.  I don't believe that's true any more, and I'm pretty sure the C# APO is fully equivalent to the Java API.
[17:01:09] dude-x: can you set the Alert handling in the python bindings?
[17:01:23] dude-x: as far as i know, Java and .Net allow you to do this
[17:01:28] RossPatterson: jimevans: The only things I dislike about WebDriver in C# are C# things, not WebDriver .NET API things.
[17:01:31] dude-x: within the API
[17:01:44] jimevans: RossPatterson: such as?\
[17:01:49] *RossPatterson would really like to have return covariance in C#.
[17:02:10] jimevans: that'd be a good one.
[17:02:45] dude-x: what's return covariance? 
[17:04:38] RossPatterson: dude-x: In .NET, you can't write two methods whose signatures differ only in their return type.  So, for example, you can't have both "bool System.Configuration.GetValue(string parameterName)" and "string System.Configuration.GetValue(string parameterName)".
[17:04:39] dhpe: RossPatterson: in github, js wins.
[17:05:07] dude-x: RossPatterson: what typed languaged support that?
[17:05:59] art_man1 has joined #selenium
[17:07:07] jimevans: dhpe: not to be pedantic, but github isn't the end-all-be-all of source code. :)
[17:07:22] RossPatterson: dude-x: C++ for many years, Java since Java5, plus a bunch of smaller languages.
[17:07:33] *jimevans is starting to channel simonstewart
[17:07:50] *RossPatterson hands jimevans the #getoffmylawn.
[17:08:11] dhpe: these rankings usually have multiple results, i think the truth is somewhere between 1st and 12th.
[17:08:13] floppyears: is the recommended approach to use the selenium/webdriver bindings or a framework that makes it easier?
[17:08:47] RossPatterson: floppyears: Frameworks rock.  I don't know anyone who's serious about automation who codes directly to the API.
[17:09:02] dhpe: but almost every website has javascript. C cannot be said is very often chosen as a language for an arbitrary software project today.
[17:09:06] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[17:09:18] RossPatterson: floppyears: But you wind up creating your own framework, so it's kinda wasteful.
[17:10:04] Dave_B has joined #selenium
[17:10:16] *adamgoucher thinks http://element34.ca/products/saunter is good for newbies and doesnt pretend not to be biased
[17:11:40] dude-x: there's also SST, a python selenium test framework
[17:12:05] floppyears: RossPatterson: what are some popular frameworks for selenium/web driver testing that are highly recommended or have a big user base?
[17:12:42] RossPatterson: floppyears: For Python, adamgoucher's Saunter is nice.
[17:12:49] dude-x: the only one that comes to mind is watir which is a ruby framework, but based on selenium meetups i've been to poeple have written their own frameworks and wrappers
[17:13:05] RossPatterson: But in general, there aren't any commonly-used frameworks.
[17:13:27] llaskin: watir is nice
[17:13:30] llaskin: but i much prefer my own
[17:13:30] RossPatterson: I'd almost say Watir is a system in its own right, not just a framework.
[17:13:38] RossPatterson: As is Cucumber.
[17:13:49] *llaskin nods
[17:13:51] llaskin: i agree
[17:16:33] adamgoucher: most frameworks are tightly coupled to the application its for. its stoopid hard to make something generic -- and for most companies it isnt worth the effort since it'll never see the outside of the firewall

[17:25:23] runnyspot: i think a DSL is a necessity if you want people to write tests across a big user base
[17:25:38] runnyspot: because you can't handhold them
[17:25:52] runnyspot: but if it's just you writing tests...
[17:26:10] runnyspot: i use nose and created my own module to subclass tests from
[17:26:29] runnyspot: giving me some more commonly used methods specific to my site
[17:28:28] dhpe: speaking of DSL, what do you think about robot framework?
[17:28:41] dude-x: EXTERMINATE
[17:29:00] dude-x: i've only recently heard of it
[17:29:07] dude-x: i have no opinion about it
[17:30:38] runnyspot: same
[17:32:53] dhpe: would you be open to write ui tests using english (or closer to english than typical webdriver bindings) like in robotframework?
[17:33:52] runnyspot: have you looked at a robot test?
[17:34:06] dhpe: yeah
[17:35:04] llaskin: runnyspot: the question you have to have is: are people writing tests programmers, or monkeys
[17:35:06] dude-x: here's what i think about English like test tools; who are your testers? are they programmers or are they non-programmer users. if most of your testers are programmers, then English like tests have a high maintenance cost and just slow you down as an application evolves. If you do have large nontechnical staff, then they are great
[17:35:07] llaskin: if monkeys, then yes, you need a DSL
[17:35:13] llaskin: if engineerings/programmers, you shouldn't need a DSL
[17:35:21] llaskin: dude-x same thought, same time
[17:35:54] runnyspot: i agree in part
[17:36:30] runnyspot: a lot of it depends on the culture of testing at your org
[17:36:48] adamgoucher: if you are not doing atdd/bdd you shouldnt be using an atdd/bdd tool. which is what cucumber/robot are.
[17:37:25] dhpe: i think the learning curve to write robot tests or webdriver api tests directly is not differing a lot. both of them needs to be studied. you can't just write english in robot and expect it to work. and webdriver api is understandable if you are able to read.
[17:38:11] dhpe: but in communication with non-technical people it is more natural to explain the test case using closer to a natural language: since you don't need to be confusing them with programming language syntax that much.
[17:38:51] adamgoucher: if all you are doing is driving a browser, then use a runner designed for doing something simple like driving a browser. the extra overhead of 'natural language' is a process consultant's wet dream and implementer's nightmare
[17:39:39] *adamgoucher enjoys picking up clients who want robot/cucumber ripped out of their organizations :)
[17:40:28] dhpe: so im trying to find out if atdd/bdd solutions have market
[17:41:05] adamgoucher: if you are doing atdd/bdd, then the tools have a market/place. but /most/ places arent. (even if management thinks they are)
[17:42:02] dhpe: most places are not doing ui test automation at all.
[17:42:19] dude-x: i think that's changing though
[17:43:04] dude-x: dhpe: i write my tests in python (using py.test) my tests can be read by lay folk because i use copious amounts of comments
[17:43:21] dude-x: I do this for myself because 3 months down the line, I won't remember what the test does
[17:43:55] dude-x: Even if its obvious what the code does, sometimes you may have tests are covering odd bugs

[18:10:32] art_man1: so to pull from this conversation about framework and BDD, as a fairly new programmer i've been trying to implement Selenium automation where i work. through a job interview i learned that some folks were using RSpec and so i've started to mimic that. previously i was just using Ruby Test Unit. any thoughts or opinions on this? 
[18:11:42] dude-x: rspec is a DSL
[18:12:20] dude-x: if you feel productive with it, then that's fine
[18:13:40] art_man1: it seems to work. my biggest hurdle is the web framework we use that has dynamic id naming. but that's a different beast. 
[18:15:47] jeichar_ has joined #selenium
[18:19:52] dude-x: dynamic ids just mean a bit more instropsection is required

[18:28:05] FalCone: using webdriver
[18:28:11] FalCone: chromedriver**
[18:29:19] dude-x: FalCone: test in what way? sounds like you should test indirectly
[18:29:31] FalCone: Like, I dunno
[18:29:40] FalCone: Pull all active js or js variables in a window?
[18:29:59] alexglow has joined #selenium
[18:30:09] FalCone: so I can parse the js, or check for the existance of a js variable somewhere in the window I'm currently looking at
[18:30:30] RossPatterson: Falcone: Are you looking for errors in the JavaScript, or just to see if the files get loaded?
[18:30:42] adamgoucher: have the developers put in something that says 'no really, we're finished loading' and check that
[18:31:00] FalCone: Uh, I'm hunting for a single intentionally placed garbage variable
[18:32:04] dawagner has joined #selenium
[18:32:13] RossPatterson: Sounds like you want to use the JavaScript executor and just get the variable's value.
[18:32:21] adamgoucher: use the js executor within a wait

[18:32:48] FalCone: but what if that variable doesn't exist?
[18:33:06] FalCone: or if that variable is in an non-inline script?

[18:34:12] Bico_Fino has joined #selenium
[18:43:56] RossPatterson: FalCone: It depends.  Several conditions, including the good programming practice of coding "var x = y", can hide the variable from you.

[19:22:11] llaskin: Ross...ooh thats vicious

[19:23:40] lukeis: i know :) all too common
[19:23:49] RossPatterson: Also, there's a difference between a programming test and a test of programming skill.  The former should run.  The latter can be conducted with a white board.
[19:24:27] jleyba: When I interview someone who lists Selenium on their resume, I love to ask "So, what's wrong with Selenium?"
[19:24:32] jleyba: let them rant for a bit

[19:28:10] RossPatterson: accurev has a cli, but they hide it well.  It's at least as capable as svn's.
[19:29:02] jimevans: jleyba: third-party library integration. would make short work of a "native-dialog handler" library.
[19:29:53] jimevans: but The Bearded One has already said "we give people too much potential for evil already"
[19:30:04] jleyba: jimevans: there's no reason you can't add something like that as an extension specific to IE
[19:30:27] jleyba: yeah, i guess we shouldn't help the spammer lot
[19:30:34] jimevans: jleyba: I find i'm less and less interested in single-browser solutions.
[19:31:03] jimevans: if it can't be made to work cross-browser, it shouldn't be in webdriver.
[19:31:07] jleyba: not every driver has knowledge of os-level windows
[19:31:23] jimevans: jleyba: that's true. 
[19:31:36] jleyba: out of all the drivers, IE is probably implemented at the lowest level
[19:32:05] jimevans: lucky me.
[19:33:01] jimevans: i'd settle for a "browser process identifier".
[19:33:40] jimevans: with the exception of safari, i'd bet the other drivers can get access to that. chrome certainly can.

[20:29:02] jleyba: how
[20:29:02] jimevans: yep, that's it.

[20:30:27] jleyba: huh. do we have something like that for java?
[20:30:46] admc has joined #selenium
[20:30:46] lukeis: i don't remember one...
[20:30:49] jimevans: nope.
[20:31:06] jimevans: i wrote it for .NET, never ported it to other languages.
[20:31:49] Manoj: 34
[20:31:51] jimevans: it seemed like a pretty common thing users were asking about.
[20:32:53] *lukeis remembers coding the example in java on the users list
[20:32:56] jimevans: and at the time, the .NET bindings didn't have anything like an ExpectedConditions class.
[20:34:56] AutomatedTester: jimevans: is it in the Support project?
[20:35:16] jimevans: yes
[20:36:25] jimevans: AutomatedTester: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dotnet/src/WebDriver.Support/UI/PopupWindowFinder.cs
[20:37:37] simonstewart: jleyba: NOOOO!
[20:37:50] jimevans: simonstewart reads the backlog...
[20:38:10] simonstewart: element.click(); wait.until(windowIsPresent("window_id"))
[20:38:43] jleyba: simonstewart: It's OK.  I'll be heading to the genius bar this evening
[20:39:01] simonstewart: Still. Harsh times, man. Harsh times
[20:39:20] dude-x: jleyba: no bumper or case?
[20:39:30] jimevans: simonstewart: right. if you have a "windowIsPresent" method. which .net didn't.
[20:39:48] simonstewart: Heh. I can see that being problemati
[20:39:49] simonstewart: c
[20:39:52] lukeis: but that assumes you can know the window id beforehand
[20:39:58] jleyba: dude-x: used to use one, thought it ruined the "feel" of the iphone5 (it's so small and light!).  in hindsight that was a mistake
[20:40:21] jimevans: plus, many people don't know how to find the popup window, and resort to "loop through all of them, taking the one I don't know about"
[20:40:30] simonstewart: lukeis: you can use more than the handle to switch to a window with
[20:40:40] lukeis: yeah, i know
[20:40:48] lukeis: :)
[20:41:28] dude-x: i've dropped my iphone5 5 times already. last time it was face down. was worried for a second; it's still fine
[20:41:30] simonstewart: heh http://www.buzzfeed.com/expresident/british-people-problems
[20:41:34] jleyba: it would be awesome if you could iterate over the child windows in JS like you can with frames
[20:41:57] simonstewart: I do 18 all the time
[20:42:39] lukeis: simonstewart: saw that earlier… i do take sugar with my tea :-/ /cc AutomatedTester
[20:42:40] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: the sugar thing is true though
[20:43:01] simonstewart: Sugar. Pfft!
[20:43:17] lukeis: and milk in tea seems sooooo weird to me
[20:43:51] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[20:45:06] AutomatedTester: lukeis: do you have black tea?
[20:45:23] simonstewart: I think you mean "African American" tea
[20:45:44] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: I think you have spent too much time in the US
[20:46:00] simonstewart: Bloody Saffas. Not getting jokes
[20:46:17] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: I did get it but I dont find PC jokes funny
[20:46:32] simonstewart: Even when they're made knowing that they're PC jokes?
[20:46:46] dude-x: i prefer Mac jokes.
[20:46:47] AutomatedTester: PC jokes make me sad
[20:47:06] AutomatedTester: because there will be one person who thinks that it isnt a joke and reality
[20:47:12] AutomatedTester: and then we become more PC
[20:47:15] AutomatedTester: and I get more sad
[20:47:16] *simonstewart facepalms
[20:47:24] lukeis: AutomatedTester: i usually only drink 'black' tea… well, what they call black tea here :)
[20:47:24] simonstewart: Then you get to be outrageous
[20:47:33] simonstewart: And "tea" here

[20:50:04] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: when are you heading back to the country that makes good Tea?
[20:50:10] simonstewart: 28th 
[20:50:16] simonstewart: I leave for France on the 21st
[20:50:30] simonstewart: "I feel that in the interests of british neighbourly spirit I should get to know my neighbours. But now that we've been living in our house 4 years it would be too weird if I was to suddenly pop round and introduce myself" 
[20:51:08] jleyba: oh wow..you've been there for 4 years?
[20:51:17] simonstewart: No. 2 and a bit
[20:51:31] simonstewart: That's one of the entries from http://www.reddit.com/r/britishproblems
[20:51:40] jleyba: oh ok
[20:51:54] simonstewart: Though I was 4 years in my last house and only met the neighbor when he came round to complain about a tree in my garden
[20:52:52] llaskin: tea should have no sugar in it
[20:52:55] llaskin: just plain black tea
[20:53:05] simonstewart: Depends on the tea. 
[20:53:36] simonstewart: I'd never put milk in Earl Grey, but definitely would in builders; tea
[20:53:48] simonstewart: :yt tea earl grey hot

[21:46:04] barancev: simonstewart: btw, what stops us from switching to webbit?
[21:46:16] simonstewart: For what? 
[21:46:40] simonstewart: Our tests? We kept running into odd hangs that made no sense and caused instability
[21:47:02] barancev: with webbit?
[21:47:19] simonstewart: For the standalone server? I view RC as being in maintenance mode and don't want to rework the architecture
[21:47:24] simonstewart: barancev: yes
[21:47:30] simonstewart: For Grid? We could.
[21:47:46] simonstewart: I rebuilt the core of our mvc framework to allow it
[21:47:52] simonstewart: and we made the switch on android
