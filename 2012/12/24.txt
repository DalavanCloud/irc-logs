[07:19:27] ankur_n: hi i have one question: this is the link to selnium reference http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-core/1.0.1/reference.html . this reference explain selenium ide or webdriver or both, and how?
[07:32:43] Manoj: ankur_n: its basically represents the Selenium 1.0 
[07:34:20] Manoj: in Selenium IDE if you select any command for e.g: Click and then in the botton of selenium IDE you will find the section called Reference, it show you a text area with properties and purpose of that command in a short form...
[07:34:37] Manoj: and the link that you shared is for all set of commands.
[07:35:14] ankur_n: going through parent directory and all. I think it is selenium ide 1.01 reference since both are uploaded on 10th june 2009. if what i think is true then this refernce has nothing to do with selenium webdriver. Am I right
[07:35:30] ankur_n: ?
[07:36:25] Manoj: its all the Selenium API's that is built in Selenium Core.
[07:41:05] ankur_n: does htis reference relates to webdriver, if it relates then how?
[07:52:11] ankur_n: what is selenium core?
[07:52:11] Manoj: WebDriver is a different API, 
[07:52:29] Manoj: Selenium 1.0 + webDriver = Selenium 2.0
[07:52:51] Manoj: Selenium Core(a Js) is Heart of Selenium RC 
[07:53:24] Manoj: pls have a visit on this at my blog : http://assertselenium.com/2012/10/29/selenium-2-0-webdriver-introduction/
[07:58:07] Manoj: hope that clears yours doubt.
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Dec 24 08:09:51 2012]
[08:09:51] ankur_n: yes what am i getting is IDE and RC work by converting commands(as mentioned in reference) into  executable js and for webdriver, browser directly runs these commands(commands in form of corresponding get or post request). So i think this reference is important for both webdriver and ide

[14:12:54] seuser: Hi.... Can anyone tell How to automate the Search functionality in an application ? [19:05] <seuser> how in general, it can be automated using Selenium
[14:15:33] seuser: Quadlex: can you answer tthat
[14:19:07] Quadlex: not this tipsy, sorry
[14:21:58] seuser: ok
[14:22:05] seuser: any one.. else ?
[14:35:30] barancev: seuser: what's the issue? do you want to get know how to enter a tex into a search box, or how to click a button, or something else?
[14:35:55] seuser: barancev: My doubt is how to automate the search functionality....
[14:36:12] barancev: what *exactly* can't you do?
[14:36:16] seuser: I am entering text clicking on search button and the results are populated. After that....?
[14:36:58] seuser: How can we automate this ? - the operations like.. serach text in the Text Field and click on search button is done..
[14:36:59] barancev: after that you have to go read the spec and design some tests and implement some checks
[14:37:08] testingb0t has joined #selenium
[14:37:17] seuser: and now i have a table of results... populated...
[14:37:49] seuser: as a manual tester.. i will know by seeing that its populating the right results...
[14:37:54] seuser: but through automation ?
[14:38:16] barancev: what's "the right results"? for automation you should formalize this
[14:38:42] barancev: robots are drastically stupid creatures...
[14:38:47] seuser: yes, I am looking for that..to do some checks.. for right results.
[14:39:16] seuser: suppose if you want to automate the search functionality... what you will do ?
[14:39:30] barancev: I'll go read the spec and design tests
[14:40:31] barancev: your search can be "weighted", "fuzzzy", "exact", "by regexp", "with grammar varialions" etc
[14:40:32] seuser: any keywords... like in jave we have... the "contains " keywords... and i need to check for all the rows that is populated..
[14:42:21] barancev: if you just want to know that each of the search result items contains some text -- find them all using findElements() method, get text of each item and ceck that it contains the required string
[14:43:18] barancev: and if you want to implement this with Selenium IDE I should tell you that it's hard, you'd better implement this in a prodramming language
[14:45:00] seuser: yes i am doing this in WebDriver.
[14:45:20] seuser: Just wnated to know.. throguh automation using webdriver How would I acheive that
[14:45:55] seuser: Thanks barancev:
[14:49:08] seuser: Happy Christmas to you and all out here right now.

[17:48:09] barancev: jimevans: are you in work mood? I have a question about cookies in IE :)

[18:03:22] rbalent has joined #selenium
[18:20:31] jimevans: barancev: i can try to answer whatever question you may have, but cookie support in IE is pretty much limited to what you can do in javascript.
[18:21:15] barancev: the question is about clearing cookies
[18:21:23] jimevans: okay, shoot.
[18:21:50] barancev: IHTLDocument2::get_cookies returns all cookies except for http_only ones
[18:22:16] jimevans: okay
[18:22:17] barancev: are there any other approaches to access these cookies?
[18:22:35] barancev: (other than acessing files directly)
[18:24:10] jimevans: i suppose you could try using the protected mode cookie handling apis (IEGetProtectedModeCookie), but that doesn't handle session cookies, and may not be valid outside the context of the IE process
[18:24:26] jimevans: plus that's IE8+ only
[18:24:59] jimevans: and it's a whole big mess of mandatory integrity control.
[18:25:58] barancev: that means that it will not work fully automatically, right?
[18:26:48] jimevans: right. what problems specifically are you running into?
[18:28:52] barancev: a tests set for one of my clients should be run in "clean state", "as a new user"
[18:28:59] barancev: I can't just do logout
[18:29:26] barancev: because some cookies remain, and the site "remembers" the user
[18:30:11] barancev: it seems that the only way is deleting the cookies file
[18:31:10] jimevans: barancev: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2009/08/20/wininet-ie-cookie-internals-faq.aspx, in particular questions 10 and 11 outline the difficulties with ie driver and cookies.
[18:31:35] jimevans: note in particular the comment that says "there is no straightforward alternative for IE7"
[18:34:32] jimevans: but for now, i must away!
