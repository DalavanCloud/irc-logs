[16:53:37] hippyjim: Hi all - i'm an irc noob, but I really need help with a selenium issue - what's the usual protocol? go into a private chat with someone, or ask the question in open chat?
[16:56:53] cheezy: hippyjim: the usual protocol is to ask the question on the channel so everyone has an opportunity to answer
[16:59:03] hippyjim: thanks cheezy - in that case, I'm using htmlsuite with the latest selenium rc triggered by Jenkins on Windows. I'm seeing an error message on *some* calls of click or clickAndWait - command execution failure with an error t.replace is not a function - anyone got any ideas about how to stop it, or work around it?

[17:00:27] hippyjim: if you need more detail, I have a stackoverflow question about it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11809265/selenium-rc-t-replace-is-not-a-function
[17:05:55] adamgoucher has joined #selenium
[17:17:40] hippyjim: guessing nobody has a clue about my error? anyone seen it before? is it a selenium bug, or am I doing something dumb?

[18:22:34] zeroChill: hi
[18:23:03] zeroChill: when trying to get a button clicked, i get "Element cannot be scrolled into view" - but it is in view. maybe the site's style is messed up, it's possible
[18:23:12] zeroChill: is there any solution to click it?
[18:29:23] zeroChill: interesting thing is, selenium ide can click it, even though it looks the same sequence
[18:29:32] zeroChill: both firefox
[18:53:03] zeroChill: ok, sending an enter instead of click worked :x
