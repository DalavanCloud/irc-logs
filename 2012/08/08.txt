[00:06:02] alphanumericone: I have a question about page objects and C#
[00:06:36] alphanumericone: I have multiple tabs on a page and would like to have a separate loadable component for each of these tabs
[00:07:28] alphanumericone: but each tab has many common elements, so I was considering making a generic tab loadable component that the other tabs inherit from

[00:14:56] AutomatedTester: alphanumericone: Page Objects is just a guide on how to make your test code more maintainable
[00:19:52] alphanumericone: The problem I run into is when I attempt to Load() the loadable component, I get the following error: Cannot implicitly convert a type 'type1' to 'type2'. An explicit conversion exists.

[00:44:36] goddard: i was curious if I automate the firefox drive how can I run two instances of it at the same time?
[00:44:56] Dude-X: sure
[00:45:09] Dude-X: two instances of the driver, or two processes
[00:45:13] Dude-X: or use grid
[00:46:37] goddard: well I have the firefox driver automatically run on a server to do some testing and there is more then one developer that may need to do it at a time
[00:52:04] AutomatedTester: goddard: the via remote webdriver?
[00:52:15] AutomatedTester: actually it doesnt matter
[00:52:36] AutomatedTester: if you instantiate FirefoxDriver twice you will get 2 Firefoxes that work independently

[10:17:40] Shivraj: am using testng for selenium automation and want to run testcases in sequence
[10:18:11] AutomatedTester: Shivraj: its not good practise to run tests in sequence
[10:19:36] Shivraj: yeah i know but i have senerio like created a group adding a member to it and then deleting the user
[10:19:53] Shivraj: if deleting the user test case runs first then it will fail
[10:20:10] Shivraj: that why i wnat to run them in sequence
[10:20:25] Shivraj: For that am using @Test(singleThreaded=true) or @Test(priority="int")
[10:21:11] Shivraj: but getting compilation error for methods singleThreaded() and priority()
[10:22:00] Shivraj: any suggestion?
[10:23:43] AutomatedTester: yes, structure your tests that they dont have the requirement to run in order
[10:23:59] AutomatedTester: duplicating a few things is fine
[10:26:00] Shivraj: will try to do so thanks.

[11:05:29] Swadq has joined #selenium
[11:06:11] AutomatedTester: Zelo: you can fire blur on the element via executescript
[11:07:37] Zelo: Automatedtester thanks
[11:07:47] Zelo: AutomatedTester*
[11:25:59] barancev: Zelo: how do you think your real users will move focus out of the element? firing an event using JS? or clicking outside the element?
[11:26:41] barancev: why do you need to use artificial actions in the tests?

[12:03:07] *AutomatedTester is just adding another item to a persons queue for review
[12:03:17] andreastt: Fixing half the jobs?  ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù would be an understatement, I think.
[12:03:30] *AutomatedTester has 4 patches waiting for review
[12:03:40] andreastt: How's the book coming along?
[12:04:06] AutomatedTester: technically I have 1 more chapter to review
[12:04:14] AutomatedTester: but I have decided to reorg a bit of the book
[12:04:20] AutomatedTester: also need to add opera mobile to it
[12:04:41] andreastt: Will there be like a section on mobile testing in general?
[12:04:54] AutomatedTester: yes
[12:04:57] AutomatedTester: an entire chapter
[12:05:13] andreastt: I'm pretty excited about that.
[12:05:24] AutomatedTester: mobile is the future
[12:05:39] andreastt: Just had a few guys from the Google search test team ask me about Android (for Opera) today.
[12:06:00] andreastt: We've sort of been sending some mixed signals wrt to that.
[12:07:53] AutomatedTester: andreastt: at least its a signal
[12:08:03] AutomatedTester: andreastt: did you ask about mobile chrome support?
[12:08:35] andreastt: I didn't, was just asked to answer some questions for andreasb.
[12:08:43] AutomatedTester: ahh
[12:08:55] AutomatedTester: I think it will be a good question to ask
[12:09:16] andreastt: Presumably it wouldn't be very different from the Android web browser.
[12:09:38] andreastt: Seeing it's all implemented natively on Android.
[12:09:45] andreastt: Well.  Sort of.
[12:09:49] AutomatedTester: andreastt: the JS would be different
[12:09:53] AutomatedTester: different engine
[12:10:28] andreastt: Indeed, but doesn't the AndroidWebDriver just use Android OS UI widget calls to do its interaction?
[12:10:38] AutomatedTester: yes
[12:12:00] AutomatedTester: andreastt: one thing I need to sort out soon is do you think 2 days at TPAC will be too much?
[12:12:17] AutomatedTester: actaully i should just send an email
[12:13:09] andreastt: We'll be around anyways, would be good to get some actual work done too.
[12:13:27] andreastt: I really should write up the section about screen captures before that.
[12:13:32] Zelo: barancev you are right and i understand the idea but sometimes it doesnt matter from app logic where i will move the focus and its better to do that by faking an event
[12:13:34] andreastt: That should be doable before October.

[12:14:04] AutomatedTester: I will send an email to the mailing list and try get consensus
[12:14:20] AutomatedTester: andreastt: we can try for 2 days and use 1 for spec and 1 for writing tests
[12:14:37] andreastt: Yay, tests!
[12:15:49] barancev: CI is failing FF tests due to problems with loading native events component
[12:16:09] Zelo: is it possible to control webdriver commands execution speed?
[12:16:16] AutomatedTester: andreastt: does that rough agenda sound good?
[12:16:18] barancev: dawagner said emmasoderberg works on this issue
[12:16:33] andreastt: Zelo: No.
[12:16:56] andreastt: AutomatedTester: I think so.
[12:17:04] barancev: Zelo: use EventFiringWebDriver to add pauses, if you really need to make it slow, but what for?
[12:17:16] RossPatterson has joined #selenium
[12:17:24] Zelo: python bindings in comparision with selenium ide is really slow. Especially when using send_keys with longer values.
[12:17:38] Zelo: barancev i need the oposite 
[12:18:29] barancev: what operation do you want to make faster?
[12:18:53] barancev: sendKeys is slow because it enters symbols one by one
[12:19:03] AutomatedTester: Zelo: the IDE just changes the value of an input, webdriver actually types it
[12:19:15] AutomatedTester: and sends through the necessary events
[12:20:05] andreastt: What will we be using for the spec tests?  Python's unittest?
[12:20:11] Zelo: thanks for clarification
[12:20:26] barancev: Zelo: to make it fast (but honest) paste the text from clipboard to the field
[12:22:10] Zelo: barancev good idea. But im wondering why if send_keys "types" i dont see letters apearing one by one? In czase of longer strings it just does nothing and than whole string appears.
[12:22:30] andreastt: :note dawagner It would be very useful to have the raw logs from Sauce on the CI‚Ä¶
[12:22:31] selbot2_: ok!
[12:23:05] barancev: Zelo: lowercase letetrs are fast to type (less events)

[12:25:44] barancev: and on the job's page there is a link to the raw server log
[12:28:13] andreastt: I think the ‚Äúif it was started successfully‚Äù condition is a part of the problem here.
[12:28:31] andreastt: Santi said he'd look into why the logs for unsuccessful jobs go missing.

[12:32:02] jimevans: barancev: yt?

[12:34:30] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[12:35:06] jimevans: I'm only on for a second, but I think I have a patch for auto handling of alerts. What's the default for the capability?
[12:35:26] Dude-X_: default is no auto handling
[12:35:39] Dude-X_: you have to set the action you want
[12:36:13] jimevans: Except on quit, apparently. 
[12:36:28] Dude-X_: wasn't aware of that.
[12:37:11] Dude-X_: but what if the alert is a navigation away from page alert
[12:37:21] Dude-X_: are those things  always consistent?
[12:38:07] jimevans: It's not spec'ed that way, but there's a shitload of bitching about IE not quitting if theres an alert open. 
[12:38:08] AutomatedTester: bbl
[12:39:28] barancev: :wiki DesiredCapabilities
[12:39:29] selbot2_: 1: 03DesiredCapabilities: (still under work) A specification of DesiredCapabilities and their content when used in JsonWireProtocol - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities
[12:40:12] jimevans: Navigation away from page "alerts" aren't consistent in IE either, but their not consistently drawn by the browser either. Major pain in my ass. 
[12:40:18] barancev: not specified in wiki... unexpectedAlertBehaviour default is "dismiss"
[12:40:38] Dude-X_: :O
[12:40:56] Dude-X_: interesting
[12:41:48] barancev: oh, no, default is "not set" :)
[12:41:56] andreastt: (I'm testing it.)
[12:42:02] barancev: Dude-X_: thanks!
[12:42:05] *jimevans hates autodismiss, so he shares Dude-X's dismay
[12:42:29] barancev: but for quit operation default is 'dismiss'
[12:43:01] barancev: I meant this operation in my answer, missed the context
[12:43:17] Dude-X_: my application has a navigation guard where 'dismiss' would stay on the current page;
[12:43:30] Dude-X_: but i can disable that guard with javascript
[12:43:51] andreastt: barancev: Right, I think I've found the culprit.
[12:43:53] barancev: no matter for quit operation what page you're on
[12:44:38] andreastt: barancev: Sauce has changed something with their Opera capabilities configuration.  If you ask for an Opera on Linux, it will say there is no such combination.  But it'll work if you give it a browser version number.
[12:45:09] barancev: andreastt: isn't this a bug in the sauce?
[12:45:11] rajan has joined #selenium
[12:45:21] andreastt: Nah.  Still failing as before.
[12:45:23] *andreastt sighs,.
[12:45:42] andreastt: The JavaScript tests seems to work.  But not the Java tests for some reason.
[12:46:10] andreastt: I wish I had the raw logs.
[12:47:29] barancev: jimevans: iirc, you told that scrollIntoView can be configured to scroll to the bottom, to the top or to the middle of the page, right? I can't find how to scroll to the middle, docs say only top and bottow are possible -- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.scrollIntoView
[12:49:03] jimevans: No top and bottom are all that are supported. I don't recall mentioning middle. 
[12:54:21] jimevans: So bottom line is that you can't ignore unhandled alerts on quit. That clarifies it.

[17:53:51] selbot2_: santiycr: note from andreastt about 2 hours ago: I really need the raw logs to be able to debug something like https://gist.github.com/3294995.  Can you get me the one for https://saucelabs.com/jobs/0605541c88454799824a3d5fd8d86b93 ? 
[17:54:36] santiycr: andreastt: that's my bad. I deployed the code that enables the new browsers
[17:54:48] santiycr: but the disk images with the new browsers are not yet fully sync'ed
[17:55:03] santiycr: it takes over 8hs to rsync our images to all servers
[17:55:43] santiycr: and in my rush to get them out there, I failed to coordinate new code with new images
[17:55:58] santiycr: good news is opera 11 and opera 12 work completely in all our OSs
[17:56:41] Dude-X: :)
[17:57:35] santiycr: also, Firefox 14.0.1 and 15.0b3 are installed in xp, 7 and linux
[17:57:54] Dude-X: even a beta
[17:57:59] santiycr: well, once this rsync is there
[17:58:36] santiycr: I plan on using davehunt's script to install firefoxes dynamically, so that any version can be used, not just the ones I install by hand
[17:58:42] Dude-X: my company has a saucelabs account i ought to try my testing my project on the servers
[17:59:15] Dude-X: how is it billed btw?

[18:00:40] andreastt: santiycr: I don't think this is related to the images not being synced yet.
[18:01:10] andreastt: santiycr: If I use SauceDriver with selenium-version="2.25.0" everything works as expected, but not when using a custom JAR.
[18:01:31] santiycr: Dude-X:  by the minute
[18:01:44] andreastt: I suspect the problem is in the OperaDriver in the JAR, but without the logs it's almost impossible to tell what goes wrong.
[18:02:02] santiycr: andreastt: ohreally
[18:02:05] Dude-X: in that case i'll probably do the free trial thing
[18:02:16] andreastt: santiycr: Have a look at :ci
[18:02:16] selbot2_: Jenkins: http://sci.illicitonion.com:8080/ | Dashboard: http://goo.gl/ydhTP
[18:02:19] santiycr: getting failures to show the logs is my next project
[18:02:34] santiycr: Dude-X:  shoot me an email with your account
[18:02:35] santiycr: I
[18:02:36] andreastt: santiycr: The Opera tests have been failing on Sauce since 0.15 made its way to Selenium turnk.
[18:02:47] santiycr: I'll be happy to have you set with minutes to do so
[18:02:56] santiycr: andreastt:  got it
[18:03:00] santiycr: getting your the failure
[18:03:04] andreastt: Awesome (-:
[18:03:15] andreastt: I've spent 8 hours today trying to figure out what's going on here.
[18:03:25] andreastt: So sorry for wasting your cycles (-;
[18:03:31] Dude-X: santiycr: my test infrastructure sets up the driver object as a singleton
[18:03:56] Dude-X: and i am not even sure how to set up mutliple test dispatch (would need developer support for that)
[18:04:24] mdgreenfield has joined #selenium
[18:05:41] santiycr: andreastt: no need to be sorry. I volunteered for this 
[18:05:54] santiycr: and the way it currently works is not ideal
[18:06:17] santiycr: Dude-X:  well, there's no need to run in parallel to use sauce, just give it a shot serially
[18:06:22] santiycr: you get other goodies ;)
[18:06:27] Dude-X: true
[18:06:50] Dude-X: i know most of the IE tests would fail because most of our page objects use XPaths a lot
[18:07:23] Dude-X: would be interesting to see if Chrome is faster

[18:07:41] santiycr: sorry for the unreadability 
[18:08:13] santiycr: Dude-X:  you'll be surprised at the quality of the IEDriver
[18:08:37] Dude-X: well i tried this out a few months ago when the IEdriver was released
[18:08:47] Spanktar has joined #selenium
[18:08:56] Dude-X: lots of tests failed; some of it has to do with jquery/prototype setting up a slightly different structure
[18:08:57] andreastt: santiycr: Thank you thank you tank you
[18:09:19] santiycr: andreastt:  I'm sorry this is as painful as it is right now
[18:09:28] santiycr: I'm working on fixing that as soon as I get the new images out the door
[18:10:09] andreastt: I was expecting something along the lines of an OperaRunner issue, 0.15 had a major rewrite of that part.
[18:10:25] andreastt: Essentially we wrap every Opera binary in a C++ program that communicates with OperaDriver over protobuffer.
[18:10:50] andreastt: santiycr: Do you do all the work over there? (-;
[18:13:39] stephend: santiycr: default sel version is still 2.18.0?
[18:13:51] stephend: I'd like to use 2.24.1 or 2.25 with firefox 14 :-)
[18:13:58] stephend: and I set the capabilities, but it's not liking it
[18:15:17] Dude-X: huh, just on a whim  i ran one test on Chrome and it threw a lot of errors; guess it doesn't like xpath?
[18:15:30] santiycr: stephend:  FF14 and FF15 are not "officially" out
[18:15:39] santiycr: I still need to rsync some disk images arond 
[18:15:50] stephend: ah, ok
[18:15:52] stephend: thx
[18:15:59] *stephend tries 13 with 2.24.1
[18:16:41] towski has joined #selenium
[18:18:05] Dude-X: weird chrome trips over a simple xpath
[18:18:20] Dude-X: maybe i should try an older chrome driver
[18:19:48] Ardesc0 has joined #selenium
[18:22:12] Dude-X: older chrome driver didn't work; changed locator to css selector
[18:22:33] Dude-X: question: does Xpath use the browser's xpath engine?
[18:24:17] stackedsax1 has joined #selenium
[18:24:44] Dude-X: how does Xpath work in webdriver
[18:24:52] ian_mac2 has joined #selenium
[18:25:38] sporkf: I just right click the element in the element tab, and click copy xpath
[18:25:58] Dude-X: that's not good :O
[18:26:12] sporkf: what's wrong with chrome's xpaths?
[18:26:54] Dude-X: would you get //div[@id="blah"]//div[@class="x"] or div/div/div[2]/div[1]/
[18:27:09] Dude-X: the latter is unmaintainable for a project!
[18:27:30] ian_mac2 has joined #selenium
[18:27:42] sporkf: and you would get first
[18:27:49] sporkf: err former
[18:28:41] Dude-X: not quite
[18:29:19] Dude-X: for an id element i got *[@id=blah]/div[1]/div[10]
[18:29:55] Dude-X: i'd give my coworkers a tongue lashing if they wrote something like that, even if it's a bit more direct
[18:30:27] Dude-X: actually i'd still be upset if they default to an xpath for no good reason
[18:31:27] *Dude-X tries latest webdriver with chrome
[18:31:38] *Dude-X wonders why i am testing this. Oh right to see if Chrome is faster than FF
[18:32:02] sporkf: what's wrong with *[@id=blah]/div[1]/div[10]  ?   Are there attributes in div[1] and div[10]  ?
[18:32:38] Dude-X: div[10] could move to div[9]
[18:32:58] sporkf: So what's the best way to deduce xpaths ?
[18:33:08] Dude-X: look at the attributes or class name
[18:33:15] Dude-X: that's the most specific to that element
[18:33:24] sporkf: so by hand?
[18:33:28] Dude-X: yes
[18:33:41] sporkf: yikes!  Thats a full time job.
[18:33:49] Dude-X: or use css selectors
[18:34:02] Dude-X: they're faster to look up and less hateful
[18:34:03] *adamgoucher welcomes sporkf to the wonderful world of automation...
[18:34:25] adamgoucher: unless you need to go back up the tree or need to look at the text of the node
[18:34:25] Dude-X: i think chromedriver findElements() is broken
[18:34:53] Dude-X: i use xpath for ascending/descending nodes
[18:35:18] Dude-X: sometimes i do find by css.findElement(xpath)
[18:37:40] barancev: CSS is not faster in modern browser versions, it's an antic myth
[18:38:05] Dude-X: antic?
[18:38:43] Dude-X: ah it seems issue 102 of chromedriver is the issue i'm experiencing
[18:38:54] barancev: ancient
[18:38:58] barancev: XPath is not faster, either, they are roughly same
[18:39:18] Dude-X: barancev: you're right, but for IE, it's SLOWER than molasses
[18:39:21] barancev: in IE6 -- yes, CSS is much faster
[18:39:32] barancev: in IE7+ they are almost same
[18:39:49] santiycr: barancev:  totally
[18:39:50] Dude-X: i don't have access to IE6, but IE8 just went by at it's casual pace with xpath lookups
[18:40:05] Dude-X: unlesss IEDriver is just slow
[18:40:23] santiycr: I'm guessing they are probably the same in all browsers in which Selenium uses the browser provided API
[18:40:29] barancev: IE is slow in itself, about ten times slower than Chorome or FF
[18:40:33] santiycr: IE is an exception
[18:40:51] santiycr: in that particular case, it depends on the implementation of the library that selenium falls back to
[18:41:25] santiycr: and sizzle is a tough competitor to fight against 
[18:41:28] barancev: IE9 32bit is significantly faster than IE9 64bit and all the previous IE versions
[18:41:41] barancev: IE9 32bit is the best of all IEs
[18:42:24] Dude-X: yeah the JS executor has a JIT
