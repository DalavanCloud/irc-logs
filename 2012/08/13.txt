[06:52:03] anotherTester: hi
[06:52:35] anotherTester: i thought so tto,..but i'm definitly using findElement(By.xpath(....))
[06:53:17] anotherTester: other people have troubles with this exception to but only with chromedriver

[06:57:01] binken has joined #selenium
[06:57:06] Dude-X_: web driver isn't thread safe
[06:57:27] Dude-X_: don't know why you get that error, but it's strange to run a thread
[06:57:30] Dude-X_: like that
[06:58:10] anotherTester: ok,..sorry was confused by the word thread,….i thought you ment why i'm writing in this chat
[06:58:23] Dude-X_: it's also possible that the internet explorer driver has a bug
[06:58:37] Dude-X_: where it's not picking the first of many input tags
[06:58:56] anotherTester: that's not excatly my code,..i just get the same exception at driver.findElement()
[06:59:11] anotherTester: I'm not using threads at all

[07:01:07] anotherTester: always at driver.findElement()
[07:01:27] anotherTester: i tried with seleniumRC too,…nothing =(

[07:11:00] Shivraj: not with classcastexp..but with creation of test cases
[07:11:12] anotherTester: what's the problem there?
[07:11:52] anotherTester: i don't understand the problem,…^^
[07:12:13] Shivraj: i hv four method createGroup(),adduser(),deleteUser(), deleteGroup()
[07:12:23] anotherTester: ok
[07:12:30] Shivraj: first wana run them in order
[07:12:34] Shivraj: else
[07:12:48] Shivraj: wanna make them independent of each other
[07:13:15] Shivraj: dont know how to proceed..
[07:13:21] anotherTester: then you have to make four classes with one testMethod in it,….
[07:13:46] anotherTester: you then comine them either in one class or run them together
[07:13:50] anotherTester: example
[07:13:51] Shivraj: yes
[07:13:59] Shivraj: that will work
[07:14:10] anotherTester: public static void testAll(){
[07:14:11] Shivraj: but 1  concern here
[07:14:22] anotherTester: createGroup()
[07:14:24] anotherTester: addUser()
[07:14:27] anotherTester: delUser()
[07:14:32] anotherTester: delGroup()
[07:14:34] anotherTester: }
[07:14:41] Shivraj: i got it
[07:14:54] anotherTester: but every Method has to be a separate TestCase to
[07:15:00] anotherTester: o
[07:15:11] anotherTester: i'm doing the same
[07:15:15] anotherTester: =)
[07:15:24] Shivraj: i know this will work fine
[07:15:26] Shivraj: :)
[07:15:46] anotherTester: are you working with firefox or ie?
[07:16:03] Shivraj: but if delGroup fails then report will show testAll() failed..
[07:16:08] Shivraj: FF
[07:16:41] Shivraj: and i want to show delGroup failed not testAll failed
[07:17:18] Shivraj: does it make any sense?
[07:17:29] anotherTester: i know,…thats my problem too,…i'm using a logger,..and whenever i enter a method i logg
[07:17:41] anotherTester: so i know where i fail
[07:18:32] Shivraj: can u tell me how to use logger before each mehtod
[07:19:44] anotherTester: well,…manually =) or you can try using an interceptor but what I know they are only available with ejb's
[07:20:16] Shivraj: :)
[07:22:15] Shivraj: appericate all ur help and time thanks

[18:23:41] barancev: here is a SO article about this error: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2230982/webbrowser-navigate-throws-comexception
[18:24:37] barancev: I think that when we get ERROR_BUSY, we have to wait a bit and make another attempt
[18:25:08] barancev: but after 2-3 attempts we can decide that the browser hands out and really throw an exception
[18:25:46] jimevans: sigh.
[18:26:31] jimevans: we don't check for the return code from Navigate2(), and experience hangs. we check and throw when it's not S_OK, and other people complain.
[18:26:52] jimevans: the worst part is, I don't control what happens inside Navigate2().
[18:26:53] barancev: yes, we have to check it
[18:27:10] jimevans: surely you see that a blind retry isn't the answer, right?
[18:27:37] barancev: but if it's ERROR_BUSY we have to make a shorl loop until IWebBrowser2::get_Busy returns false, or timeout exceeded
[18:28:46] barancev: or, may be we have to wait until IWebBrowser2::get_Busy returns false after closing an alert?
[18:29:04] barancev: I've necer seen this ERROR_BUSY in other tests, only AlertsTest
[18:29:12] barancev: never seen
[18:29:30] barancev: IE closes alerts too slow
[18:30:44] jimevans: have i mentioned how much i hate IE lately?
[18:31:22] barancev: yes, often :)
[18:31:49] jimevans: but i don't think a loop is the right answer.
[18:31:58] jimevans: not for alert handling.

[23:08:40] AutomatedTester: dawagner: hola
[23:08:59] dawagner: Hi AutomatedTester :)
[23:09:17] AutomatedTester: has Simon left already?
[23:09:24] *AutomatedTester knows he was flying today
[23:09:26] dawagner: I believe he's currently on a plane
[23:09:30] *dawagner checks his calendar
[23:09:31] AutomatedTester: ok
[23:09:49] dawagner: Flight isn't in his calendar... My guess is yes, though
[23:09:49] AutomatedTester: I will let the bomb explode in his inbox
[23:09:50] dawagner: Warum?
[23:10:02] dawagner: Bombs + planes?
[23:10:07] *AutomatedTester has a MSFT person coming to TPAC
[23:10:13] AutomatedTester: to talk WebDriver
[23:10:14] dawagner: Ooh, cool!
[23:12:38] dawagner: santiycr: How are things looking for those firefox issues we were having?

[23:19:49] andreastt: It didn't use to… so the Opera 11 job was being run on Opera 12.
[23:19:57] dawagner: I see :)
[23:20:01] andreastt: Actually, it still is due to a bug in Sauce.
[23:20:13] andreastt: But that's entirely unrelated (I hope) (-:
[23:20:18] dawagner: I can't help but notice you have some failing tests running :)
[23:20:34] andreastt: Better with some failing tests than all failing tests.
[23:20:45] dawagner: Very true
[23:20:49] andreastt: I've a fix for five or so of them in OperaDriver head.
[23:21:06] dawagner: Awesome :)
[23:21:14] dawagner: I'll leave all the opera stuff to you then :)
[23:21:18] dawagner: How's getting mobile on the CI going?

[23:22:19] selbot2: 03andreastt@opera.com 4 days ago - AndreasTolfTolfsen: The wire protocol is circumvented when the driver is running within the same JVM, allowing OperaDriver to use this #equals() implementation | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=17649 | http://seleniumhq.org/ci.jsp?r=17649
[23:22:48] andreastt: dawagner: I added a NP check there to make it return false.
[23:22:57] andreastt: I have no idea whether your code there can be removed now or not.
[23:23:07] dawagner: w00t
[23:23:51] dawagner: I *think* it can, but I'm not *sure* it can; I'll do some experimenting at some point :)
[23:24:06] andreastt: Cool.
[23:24:41] andreastt: OD is now relying on that #equals() method.
[23:24:57] andreastt: We were previously rolling our own, which messed with the remote driver.
[23:25:40] andreastt: Not sure if it's the right thing to do, but we pass on our hashCode value to RemoteWebElement on construction.
[23:25:50] andreastt: Seems to work, though.
[23:26:41] dawagner: As long as you're inside the same JVM, and trust your element singleton-ness, hashcode passing should work fine...
[23:27:46] dawagner: Woo, Sauce does SSL by default now! Thanks santiycr!
[23:27:48] andreastt: Please feel free to disable the jobs for now, by the way.
[23:28:01] andreastt: I don't seem to have permission to do so.
[23:28:06] dawagner: I'm happy for them to run, I'd be happier if they passed :)
[23:28:12] andreastt: k
[23:28:14] dawagner: You don't? :S I'll check that now...
[23:28:33] dawagner: You should definitely be able to
[23:28:48] andreastt: Hrm.  I'll have another look in the morning.
[23:28:51] andreastt: Almost 1 am here.
[23:28:55] dawagner: No "Disable Project" button top-right? http://sci.illicitonion.com:8080/job/Opera%2011.62%20Linux%20Java%20Tests/
[23:28:58] dawagner: There is that :)
[23:29:00] *andreastt opens that
[23:29:34] andreastt: Ahem.  I must've missed it.  It's very much there now (=
[23:29:38] dawagner: heh :)
[23:29:48] dawagner: The Jenkins UI is very, very inconsistent :)
[23:29:58] andreastt: So, anyways.  The hash code/equality tests are fixed.
[23:30:08] dawagner: Woo!
[23:30:16] andreastt: I'm working on a refactor of the abomination that is the OD typing code.
[23:30:30] andreastt: Whoever wrote that must've thought they were being very clever.
[23:31:12] dawagner: Yes, I've seen a few things like that in there...
[23:31:29] andreastt: https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver/blob/master/src/com/opera/core/systems/OperaWebElement.java#L208
[23:31:32] andreastt: Behold.
[23:31:53] dawagner: I...
[23:31:55] dawagner: But...
[23:31:58] dawagner: I...
[23:32:05] dawagner: But...
[23:32:15] dawagner: Oh.
[23:32:35] andreastt: When you mix it with this beautiful method, things get very… shall we say… not very predictable: https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver/blob/master/src/com/opera/core/systems/scope/services/ums/OperaExec.java#L109
[23:32:54] andreastt: Bonus point for anyone who actually understands the flow of this code.
[23:33:11] andreastt: (Hint: OperaExec is constructed only once.)
[23:33:22] *andreastt sighs
[23:33:51] dawagner: Better things are coming, though!
[23:33:56] andreastt: Indeed they are.
[23:35:11] jimevans: dawagner: i have a fix for the window switching test.

[23:36:05] jimevans: building now.
[23:36:33] jimevans: does the CI build pick up from the prebuilt directory, or the downloads page?
[23:36:44] dawagner: Prebuilt directory
[23:37:12] jimevans: that's better. i don't have to re-release then.

[23:43:48] jimevans: no problem. glad i could find it without difficulty.
[23:45:10] jimevans: the IE9 failures for BasicMouseInterfaceTest are because we keep firing WM_MOUSEMOVE messages at the browser window in an effort to solve the mouse cursor within the window bounds problem.
[23:45:28] jimevans: so we get a different list of events from the jquery drag-drop widget.
[23:45:43] jimevans: the test needs to be changed to use a regex instead of an exact match.
[23:45:56] jimevans: see the similar .NET tests for the necessary changes.
