[00:26:18] sixpindin: Hi all, quick javascript question: I'm new to javascript and I'm trying to test some scripts out using the console in firebug, but I always get TypeError: document.getElementById("demo") is null
[00:26:32] sixpindin: Yet the same function works perfectly when it's embedded in the HTML
[00:26:39] sixpindin: Anybody know what I'm missing?
[00:26:55] sixpindin: This is the function:function jamie(){document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML=Date();}
[00:27:37] Dude-X: if you're using firebug, try $('#demo')
[00:28:47] sixpindin: Thanks Dude-x; That returns null
[00:29:21] Dude-X: does the inspector see that element with that id?
[00:29:24] Dude-X: does it start with a number?
[00:29:46] sixpindin: Inspector sees it. It's actually this page : http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_events
[00:30:10] sixpindin: I'm just trying to run exactly the same function from the console (the one that updates the date) - but it doesn't work
[00:30:29] Dude-X: i'm going to try it in firefox
[00:30:35] sixpindin: I was trying various things the other day, trying to select elements, etc, with javascript, but I never could get it to work
[00:30:53] sixpindin: Thanks, really kind of you to take the time
[00:31:26] sixpindin: Just that I'm thinking of building a javascript library for some of my webdriver stuff; hence learning javascript
[00:31:53] Dude-X: i think it's because it's inside an iframe
[00:31:58] Dude-X: not sure how to switch to an iframe
[00:33:00] sixpindin: Ok, I'll see if I can dig-up some information on that then. It's just that I don't even know where to start with google! -
[00:34:08] sixpindin: + I don't see an iframe tag...
[00:34:21] Dude-X: hmm it's returning null for everything....
[00:34:28] Dude-X: interestnig
[00:36:11] sixpindin: I can run simple javascript functions like '+' and 'alert' but can't seem to select any elements. Well, if you think of anything, I'd be really grateful to know!
[00:36:28] Dude-X: don't know what's the deal with that page!
[00:36:48] sixpindin: I seem to get it with all the pages that I've tried...
[00:37:16] Dude-X: 10.1.2 is broken then
[00:37:21] Dude-X: because i am getting nulls for everything
[00:37:31] Dude-X: expect 10.1.3 soon!
[00:38:03] Dude-X: try $$('#demo')
[00:38:48] sixpindin: >>> $$('#demo');
[00:38:50] sixpindin: []
[00:39:07] sixpindin: Is that good? - Is that just an array or something?
[00:39:21] Dude-X: empty array
[00:39:35] sixpindin: Why did $$ work?
[00:39:41] Dude-X: for me?
[00:39:44] sixpindin: I'll try appending the other function with that
[00:39:45] Dude-X: i haven't tried it;
[00:39:50] sixpindin: I tried it, worked.
[00:40:05] Dude-X: but you said you got an empty array
[00:40:20] sixpindin: I did.
[00:40:20] Dude-X: it should say <p> or something
[00:40:22] sixpindin: facepalm
[00:40:24] sixpindin: course
[00:40:28] sixpindin: #demo\
[00:40:34] sixpindin: I guess.
[00:40:41] sixpindin: Still, it wasn't 'null'
[00:40:53] Dude-X: null and empty array are almost the same
[00:42:19] sixpindin: Hum... well thanks for trying anyway, if you think of anything then I'd really appreciate you dropping me a line, you can even mail me on sixpindin@gmail.com if you get any brainwaves. I'm sure it's something simple . . . 
[00:45:07] sixpindin: + it may be how I'm accessing the Document object...Just an idea.

[00:50:23] Dude-X: it should just work
[00:50:35] sixpindin: Like so many things in life :(
[00:52:53] Dude-X: using safari inspector
[00:53:01] Dude-X: i was able to find elements with $$
[00:53:29] Dude-X: still can't find p#demo but i can find other things on that 
[00:53:30] Dude-X: page
[00:53:35] Dude-X: that's not in an iframe
[00:54:14] xtian_ has joined #selenium
[00:54:31] sixpindin: Cheers, I'll give that a try and see if I can get any further. Thanks again for the help.
[00:55:00] Dude-X: i'm also learning javascript myself
[00:55:05] Dude-X: to improve my webdriver tests :D
[00:57:01] sixpindin: Same reason then! - Yea, I was thinking of implimenting loads of funky methods in C# then I figured I could just build a java-script library for various things and get the added bonus of learning javascript and probably being albe to go further than what webdriver would let me do otherwise
[00:58:37] sixpindin: We should combine any nice breakthroughs. If I start putting something together then I'll upload it - that's the other nice thing about putting together a javascript library: it's not bound to C#
[00:59:56] Dude-X: i prefer using native webdriver calls because it lets other less technically inclined to write page methods

[01:00:10] Dude-X: but damn these JS widgets
[01:00:26] Dude-X: you need to wait on them differently or interact with them differently
[01:00:44] Dude-X: but for CSS stuff sometimes it helps to use javascript magic to make stuff work
[01:01:08] Dude-X: but it makes me wonder if the widget breaks that the javascript "fixes it"
[01:01:11] sixpindin: Totally, I would use native stuff whenever possible. Just that there are some things that I'd like to do which (I think) work better by using javascript
[01:02:14] sixpindin: Do you mean that you might go 'round' the widget instead of through it?
[01:02:26] sixpindin: Appologies if I've misunderstoof
[01:02:29] sixpindin: d
[01:06:38] Dude-X: well here's a real example
[01:06:47] Dude-X: we've been using selenium since the 2.0alpha
[01:07:01] sixpindin: Ok
[01:07:07] Dude-X: the prior devs used javascript to select things in dropdowns
[01:07:23] Dude-X: it would would set the value to the desired value
[01:07:34] Dude-X: good for stability
[01:07:42] Dude-X: bad when the values can change (or should not exist!)
[01:08:06] Dude-X: i fixed that when i found out why a certain test was failing for having a specific value
[01:08:15] sixpindin: Would it actually add the value to the dropdown? - Why not just send keys with JAvascript?
[01:08:17] Dude-X: so that's a minor example
[01:08:21] sixpindin: assuming that I've understood
[01:08:29] Dude-X: well that's just something that was done
[01:08:35] Dude-X: now a more relevant example
[01:08:39] sixpindin: kk
[01:08:59] Dude-X: we have this widget that needs a mouse over to activate but it's only activated by css :hover
[01:09:19] Dude-X: javascript can't touch that widget unless we modify that widget
[01:09:41] Dude-X: if for some reason the CSS breaks, then the javascript code will just "make it succeed"
[01:09:44] sixpindin: Why can't javascript touch it?
[01:10:02] sixpindin: (remember: javascript n00b)
[01:10:03] Dude-X: it won't respond to click events
[01:10:13] rbalent has joined #selenium
[01:10:26] Dude-X: because javascript is not listening for the hover event, the CSS engine is
[01:10:37] sixpindin: Right, I understand, I thought you meant that javascript could not interact with it at all (IE, get properties, etc)
[01:11:48] Dude-X: it can't activate it and expose the change
[01:11:55] Dude-X: it can access the element
[01:12:05] Dude-X: but it can't respond to the mouseover
[01:12:27] sixpindin: You can't activate css events in javascript?
[01:12:41] sixpindin: sorry if I'm getting beyond the point, continue if so
[01:12:51] Dude-X: not that i am aware of
[01:13:12] Dude-X: a developer on my team had trouble with this one widget
[01:13:18] Dude-X: i told him to just execute javascript 
[01:13:24] Dude-X: i also suggested, put an invisible div around it
[01:13:31] Dude-X: so that the click can propagate
[01:13:45] sixpindin: icks can do that?
[01:13:46] Dude-X: but the hover event needs to be kicked off so that the element can show and then be able to receive clicks
[01:14:01] Dude-X: so my invisible container idea wouldn't work
[01:14:06] sixpindin: ah
[01:15:59] cheezy has joined #selenium
[01:17:29] Dude-X: so many languages to learn
[01:17:37] Dude-X: i'm reading about javascript and Go at the moment
[01:17:45] Dude-X: I'd like to make a client of webdriver for Go
[01:17:49] Dude-X: that would be cool.
[01:18:26] sixpindin: I guess it's learning the ones that you need to though, except for F#, which I just want to learn - {googles 'Go'}
[01:18:43] Dude-X: google 'google go'
[01:18:51] Dude-X: or golang.org
[01:19:01] sixpindin: reading now
[01:19:34] sixpindin: lol@being used "for real stuff"
[01:19:40] Dude-X: if you like python, and C but are a bit put off by crazy pointer syntax of C, then you'll like Go
[01:20:21] sixpindin: I touched on Python and I did like it. Suprising how much I did with so little code
[01:20:49] Dude-X: also another advantage of Go is the go-routine
[01:20:58] Dude-X: which is Go's version of co-routines
[01:21:08] Dude-X: makes it easy to do concurrent programming
[01:21:26] Dude-X: it's designed by the creator of unix Rob Pike
[01:21:30] Dude-X: among others
[01:21:56] sixpindin: Ah, I've never worked with concurrent programming - that comes with my next programming belt
[01:21:57] Dude-X: time to go home!
[01:22:27] sixpindin: Enjoy - cheers again

[16:34:23] t55e: While running our internal tests for the selenium2library for robotframework, it appears that the selenium 'browser.switch_to_window' method is failing under selenium 2.25.0 and firefox 14.0.1. Can anyone else confirm this?
[16:34:54] t55e: note also I am running on Ubuntu 11.04
[16:35:26] barancev: t55e: :gist the stacktrace

[16:55:18] t55e: brancev: posted https://gist.github.com/3258535.  This is robotframework debug output as compared to python stacktrace as no real error is produced. The system (robotframework) simple hangs
[16:56:43] t55e: branacev: I was loking at reproducing using only a simple python unittest case. But wanted to see if anyone esle might have seen an isssue here

[17:19:42] t55e: barancev: off the top of my head i'm not sure what 81999 is.  Yeah I didn't find that traceback any use which is why I am trying to make a small test script...

[19:17:32] t55e: barancev: the issue I am seeing is possibly (most likely) within our code. I am investigating further. sorry for the scare and thanks for the help.
[19:20:33] t55e: barancev: if I do execute_script("return [ window.id, window.name, document.title, document.location ];") it hangs but if I change document.location to docuemnt.url, as in execute_script("return [ window.id, window.name, document.title, document.url ];") it doesn't
[19:21:02] t55e: I know this test was passing as is in earlier version of our software/firefox/selenium
[19:21:26] t55e: and it doesn't look like we changed anything around our failing test so...
