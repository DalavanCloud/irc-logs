[01:21:27] t55e: barancev: here is a simple unittest which reproduces the problem https://gist.github.com/3260821
[01:24:48] t55e: requesting document.location using an execute script hangs selenium
[01:29:08] t55e: added traceback
[01:29:19] t55e: https://gist.github.com/3260821
[01:51:21] t55e: the above code works under selenium 2.24.0 but not 2.25.0

[12:01:09] pranavk: >>> da=d.get('http://www.google.com') always gives me None irrespective of the website i want to GET.
[12:02:04] pranavk: any idea, how to cure this problem ?
[12:04:54] barancev: pranavk: what do you expect to get as the result of get operation?
[12:05:24] barancev: get returns void, by design
[12:08:50] pranavk: barancev: i am actually not even able to grep any element loaded....
[12:09:01] pranavk: barancev: exactly like this , : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7065829/python-webdriver-in-ie-returns-none-for-all-find-elements
[12:10:04] barancev: pranavk: what selenium version do you use?
[12:10:25] barancev: this SO question is one year old
[12:10:46] pranavk: barancev: 2.25.0
[12:13:45] pranavk: barancev:  sorry, may be i am doing something wrong,,,, actually there is lot of proxy stuff at my site, so may be i missed something
[12:13:52] pranavk: some env variable or anything else
[12:14:39] barancev: do you see the browser window, and the target site opened in it?
[12:16:47] pranavk: barancev: no
[12:20:26] pranavk: barancev: i tried the same thing on a server without proxy and it worked, seems like selenium is not able to handle stuff with proxies
[12:21:42] barancev: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html#using-a-proxy
[12:22:50] pranavk: ooo,,,, okay thnks
[12:23:02] barancev: but it is related to proxy between the broweser and the target webapp
[12:23:38] barancev: if a proxy blocks connection between selenium and the browser, you have to configure proxy settings to enable connections
[12:24:22] pranavk: okay got it

[19:59:35] ksmth: a google search suggested I was having trouble with my firewall, because visiting http://localhost:4444/grid/console returns a 403
[IRC logfile - Started Sun Aug  5 20:00:12 2012]
[20:00:12] ksmth: but I have just double checked that I had no firewall running, I'm kind of lost.
