[04:18:49] martisj: I'm trying to assert some text on the final page i land on and not the intermediate ones that i am redirected through.
[04:21:05] Dude-X_: just have a long enough wait command i suppose
[04:21:28] Dude-X_: or rather, have waits for elements to disappear on each redirect page
[04:21:35] Dude-X_: before searching for the element on the final page
[04:22:13] martisj: i hacked it with time.sleep
[04:22:19] martisj: but seems brittle
[04:22:21] martisj: dodgy
[04:22:51] Dude-X_: time.sleep is useful occasionally
[04:23:05] Dude-X_: but use WebdriverWait class
[04:24:28] Dude-X_: have a few generic wait functions that wait for an element to disappear, it can look like WebDriverWait(driver, 20).until(lambda d: len(d.findElements(*locator)) == 0)
[04:24:44] Dude-X_: that's one that is particular to your case
[04:50:18] dmachi has joined #selenium
[04:55:27] martisj: aha :)
[04:55:29] martisj: thanks 
[04:55:40] martisj: until lambda d?

[05:02:52] martisj: is it possible to listen for an ajaxcomplete event with selenium?
[05:03:02] martisj: with some fancy driver.execute_script() ?
[05:08:11] algard has joined #selenium
[05:11:31] Dude-X_: maybe...
[05:12:08] Dude-X_: you can use d.execute_script_async 
[05:12:47] Dude-X_: it will give you a callback function that you can write a custom function to wait for some dat
[05:13:01] Dude-X_: but i don't think it's useful to wait for data from a server
[05:13:13] Dude-X_: it's better to wait for some element to appear
[05:13:37] Dude-X_: i am looking for an opportunity to use the Ajax execute_scriipt for something
[05:13:59] Dude-X_: maybe when i start using the grid, I can reduce wire calls
[05:14:11] Dude-X_: with execute_script_async
[05:14:16] Dude-X_: :apidocs
[05:14:17] selbot2: .NET: http://goo.gl/Fm3cw | Java: http://goo.gl/kKQqM | Ruby: http://goo.gl/cFyyT | Python: http://goo.gl/5yWoR
[05:15:36] Dude-X_: i do things like wait for jQuery animations to complete
[05:15:52] Dude-X_: in javascript, but i have my own code do the looping
[05:16:30] Dude-X_: i can use execute_async_script to have it wait in the browser...
[05:16:51] Dude-X_: that could be very useful
[05:17:09] *Dude-X_ wonders what diabolical things i can do
[05:18:30] martisj: that sounds bloody sick :)
[05:21:07] Dude-X_: the .until function of web driver wants a function that takes a driver object
[05:22:23] Dude-X_: you can either pass a function object that has access to the variables you need, or create a class that the constructor can take a locator or WebElement, and then have a __call__ function that takes a driver object
[05:24:06] Dude-X_: otherwise lambda is the simplest way to do this
[05:24:23] martisj: a lot of terminology i didn't understand there.
[05:25:57] Dude-X_: that's just python and class terminlogy
[05:26:33] Dude-X_: well gotta sleep
[05:27:07] Dude-X_: to answer your question, have a series of waits, where you wait for each element on the intermediate pages to disappear
[05:27:22] Dude-X_: then you locate the element you wants when you get to the page you want
[05:28:21] stephend: martisj: did I point you to https://blog.mozilla.org/webqa/2012/07/12/how-to-webdriverwait/ yet?
[05:28:38] martisj: stephend: nope
[05:28:39] martisj: thanks though
[05:28:50] stephend: np
[05:29:03] martisj: Dude-X_: okay thanks

[09:58:48] andreastt: martisj: WebDriverWait is a helper for adding an explicit wait to your program.
[09:59:07] andreastt: You can tell it to wait until a given condition is met before continuing on.
[09:59:20] andreastt: Helpful if your page loads elements using XHR/Ajax or something.

[10:00:45] martisj: I'm just getting started with setting it up :)
[10:01:37] andreastt: Correspondingly, there's also an implicit wait.  Which will wait for x time if it can't find an element.

[10:26:32] andreastt: How are we meant to list available sources?
[10:26:40] simonstewart: There's a getLogs command
[10:26:52] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: !!!!
[10:26:56] AutomatedTester: howdy
[10:27:07] simonstewart: (just got a new machine, so install intellij on it now)
[10:27:34] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: is there a reason why WebStorage APIs havent been added to FirefoxDriver?
[10:27:47] simonstewart: No-one's done it yet
[10:27:51] andreastt: simonstewart: But LocalLogs#getAvailableLogTypes() just returns an immutable set of LogType.CLIENT?  Should it be retuning the keys of Map<String, List<LogEntry>> localLogs instead?
[10:27:52] simonstewart: That's the only reason
[10:28:01] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: okey dokey...
[10:28:07] *AutomatedTester will do it today
[10:28:24] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: I thought that was the case but thought to check
[10:28:28] simonstewart: andreastt, that's suboptimal
[10:28:32] andreastt: I don't get what CLIENT is meant to represent here.
[10:28:43] simonstewart: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/log/types
[10:29:19] simonstewart: On the remote webdriver, it represents what's been happening in the local remote client
[10:29:23] simonstewart: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Logging
[10:29:27] simonstewart: As opposed to what's been going on in the server
[10:30:09] andreastt: Right, but there appears to be two different types of “log types” here.
[10:30:22] andreastt: One which I'd call source which you use when you add a new log entry.
[10:30:32] andreastt: The other what kind of log it represents in the WD context.
[10:30:41] simonstewart: Well, there's many types of logs
[10:30:46] simonstewart: Take something like Sauce
[10:31:09] andreastt: Specifically we really need to separate between the different types of logs the browser will give us.
[10:31:23] simonstewart: There's the logs of the local HTTP command executor, the logs of the gateway machine (both per session and generally), the logs of the remote webdriver server and potentially the logs of the browser
[10:31:36] simonstewart: And that's why you can ask for the available log types
[10:31:42] simonstewart: With a suggested list to start with
[10:31:47] martisj: is there a good method to count how many elements of a certain class I've got in one page?
[10:32:08] simonstewart: driver.findElements(By.className("foo")).getSize()
[10:32:10] davehunt has joined #selenium
[10:33:04] martisj: java?
[10:33:09] andreastt: simonstewart: And just to be clear, regardless of the log type and in which context, each would be represented by an instance of LocalLogs?
[10:33:16] simonstewart: Yeah. But the same idea applies in other languages
[10:33:37] simonstewart: andreastt: I'd need to read the code
[10:33:57] martisj: simonstewart: okay, thanks, I'm using python and it's doing cool random thigns ;)
[10:34:39] simonstewart: andreastt: once I'd retrieved the logs across the wire, I'd transform them into LocalLogs
[10:35:19] andreastt: So for one browser there may be several types of logs too.
[10:35:23] simonstewart: Though reading that, it looks like we create an ImmutableSet in the default constructor
[10:35:27] simonstewart: How the heck would that work?
[10:35:32] simonstewart: andreastt: indeed
[10:35:35] NeptuNooo: waiting for invisibility of element causes "unable to locate element" expection in my test. nonsesne
[10:35:44] lllama has left #selenium
[10:35:45] simonstewart: With the ability to add even more (such as "performance" or "web timings")
[10:35:45] NeptuNooo: (sorry for interrupting )
[10:35:55] andreastt: Specifically we have ecmascript, java, m2, network, xml, html, css, xslt,, svg, bittorrent, voice, widget and selftest logs in Opera.
[10:36:13] simonstewart: Plenty of log types, then :)
[10:37:13] andreastt: Currently I add them to _one_ instance of LocalLogs using LocalLogs#addEntry(operaSource, new LogEntry(…))
[10:37:26] andreastt: Maybe that's wrong.
[10:37:41] AutomatedTester: martisj: len(driver.find_elements(By.CLASS, "foo")) 
[10:38:02] martisj:  AutomatedTester: THANKS!
[10:38:17] simonstewart: Depends on the granularity you want
[10:38:28] martisj: loooool
[10:38:30] andreastt: I see the point of LogTypes and how it connects with the other Selenium components, but addEntry has the arguments String logType, LogEntry entry.
[10:38:59] simonstewart: Right
[10:39:05] simonstewart: What's the problem?
[10:39:12] andreastt: That's totally fine, of course, if each component uses a separate LocalLogs.
[10:39:15] AutomatedTester: *sigh* extensions make me a little sad
[10:39:26] simonstewart: andreastt: agreed
[10:39:30] andreastt: But then LocalLogs#getAvailableTypes() needs to be changed.
[10:39:41] simonstewart: We can do that
[10:40:02] simonstewart: Emma's code is currently being worked on quite a bit
[10:40:12] simonstewart: I expect it'll flex as we run into things like this
[10:40:21] andreastt: Yes, I was hoping to talk to her about it.

[10:41:02] simonstewart: (I've almost finished configuring IntelliJ)
[10:41:08] simonstewart: Hadanza!
[10:41:10] andreastt: Having access to logs in WebDriver is pretty darn awesome.
[10:41:24] simonstewart: Indeed. It's been something I've been keen to se
[10:41:27] simonstewart: e
[10:41:31] simonstewart: But never quite had the time to implement
[10:41:38] simonstewart: I do worry about running out of memory, though

[10:48:01] simonstewart: We need to tidy some of that up. Things like the "profiler" package in logging needs to be in support
[10:48:29] simonstewart: And the "logging" package itself adds a dependency on guava to the core APIs
[10:48:35] simonstewart: Which Is Not Allowed
[10:50:51] andreastt: Isn't Guava shipped with everything we have?
[10:51:12] simonstewart: Probably
[10:51:19] simonstewart: But I want the core interfaces to be dependency free
[10:51:23] andreastt: Would seem silly not to rely on it.
[10:51:38] simonstewart: So that people can make any choice that they want to in implementation
[10:55:04] simonstewart: I can't begin to describe how little I like Eclipse
[10:56:38] andreastt: simonstewart: It's just nitpicking from my side, I don't care if we skip Guava in the core API's.

[11:02:45] simonstewart: Oh
[11:02:48] simonstewart: I see

[11:03:28] andreastt: And start a new browser, etc.
[11:03:35] simonstewart: eh?

[11:05:38] simonstewart: Well, shoot
[11:05:43] andreastt: Anyways.  This is all due to inferior design decisions in software using OperaDriver.

[11:10:58] mattsmith: right, seleniumhq docs advise setting the grid up using that 
[11:11:07] mattsmith: so thats the way I went :-)
[11:11:36] simonstewart: We could probably fix that
[11:12:23] mattsmith: apologies, my JRE says 1.7.0_05
[11:12:28] simonstewart: nuts
[11:12:32] mattsmith: thats on the node

[11:12:44] simonstewart: What about where the browsermob proxy is?
[11:13:00] mattsmith: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_26-b03)
[11:13:10] mattsmith: looks like that is the place to upgrade

[11:17:32] NeptuNooo: well it's funny but im getting .NoSuchElementException: Unable to locate element   exception when waiting for invisibility of the element
[11:17:40] NeptuNooo: the thing is i am waiting for the element to be invisible
[11:17:50] NeptuNooo: and im getting exception that it is not present
[11:17:54] NeptuNooo: but this is what i want 
[11:18:53] NeptuNooo: i want the element to be not present
[11:18:59] simonstewart: The ExpectedConditions catch that exact exception
[11:19:05] simonstewart: You shoudn't see it
[11:19:09] simonstewart: Which version of selenium are you using?
[11:19:26] NeptuNooo: 2.25
[11:19:49] simonstewart: Hmmm...

[11:25:02] simonstewart: Still going through my backlog
[11:25:08] simonstewart: Summary?
[11:25:19] AutomatedTester: Microsoft want to chat about WebDriver at TPAC
[11:25:36] simonstewart: Ohhh...
[11:25:43] simonstewart: Hixie also provided some feedback on the spec
[11:25:46] simonstewart: We've got work to do
[11:26:01] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: please share the feedback
[11:26:08] simonstewart: Of course
[11:31:45] NeptuNooo: org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: Unable to locate element: {"method":"css selector","selector":"div.WikiaArticle figure a img"} Command duration or timeout: 30.11 seconds For documentation on this error, please visit: (...)org.openqa.selenium.support.events.EventFiringWebDriver$2.invoke(EventFiringWebDriver.java:101) at $Proxy9.findElement(Unknown Source) at org.openqa.selenium.s

[11:34:05] NeptuNooo: org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.ExpectedConditions$10.apply(ExpectedConditions.java:275)  <-- this is exactly invisibility of element  method
[11:34:26] NeptuNooo: and after that - Unable to locate elemenet exception
[11:45:13] mattsmith: simonstuart, looks like upgrading java hasn't worked for me, any other ideas?
[11:45:20] mattsmith: still seeing the same symptoms
[11:45:31] simonstewart: Slow connection to SSL sites?
[11:46:14] mattsmith: I don't think so, what would be classed as slow?
[11:46:24] simonstewart: 20-30 seconds
[11:46:38] mattsmith: agh, no, nowhere near them sorts of times
[11:46:51] mattsmith: its strange, my previous setup had been woeking
[11:46:51] simonstewart: OK. So what problem are you seeing?
[11:46:58] mattsmith: nothing had changed
[11:49:00] mattsmith: The firefox wind opens as it should, does its usual thing i.e navigate the site but then as soon as the next page is requested (https) i get the "server not found" error within firefox
[11:49:00] simonstewart: So what problem are you seeing?
[11:49:14] simonstewart: Have you set a proxy?
[11:49:49] mattsmith: Yep the proxy is set
[11:50:08] mattsmith: its set each test run with a new browser mob port
[11:50:20] mattsmith: that all appears to be working
[11:50:44] mattsmith: i.e I request the port from browser mob, echo it out
[11:50:59] mattsmith: the same port appears in the firefox network config
[11:51:18] simonstewart: Take a look at the proxy config in firefox.
[11:51:25] simonstewart: It's possible we only set the http and not the https proxy
[11:52:17] mattsmith: SSL proxy is set also swell as FTP proxy
[11:52:25] simonstewart: To the right address?
[11:52:30] simonstewart: In the running firefox instance?
[11:52:35] mattsmith: yep and same port 
[11:52:36] mattsmith: yep
[11:52:57] simonstewart: Is the BrowserMob proxy configured to handle SSL requests?
[11:53:33] mattsmith: how do you mean? 
[11:54:00] simonstewart: I don't know whether the browsermob proxy is configured to handle SSL proxying out of the box, or whether it's a magic switch that needs to be set
[11:54:26] mattsmith: i'm not to sure, 
[11:54:35] mattsmith: it's worked previously
[11:54:42] mattsmith: i find it very strange
[11:54:55] simonstewart: So what changed in the system?
[11:55:11] mattsmith: nothing
[11:55:26] mattsmith: browser mob stopped accepting connections last night
[11:55:41] simonstewart: And you've bounced browsermob?
[11:55:47] mattsmith: was serving up an error on requests to the API
[11:55:52] mattsmith: yep
[11:56:07] mattsmith: restarted every element in the chain this morning
[11:56:23] simonstewart: I dunno then
[11:56:26] simonstewart: Sorry
[11:57:01] mattsmith: :-(, thats ok,
[11:57:10] mattsmith: it's got to be something really trivial

[12:06:06] AutomatedTester: and no logo

[12:06:13] simonstewart: Does it charge?
[12:06:17] AutomatedTester: yea

[12:06:28] AutomatedTester: no
[12:06:46] AutomatedTester: battery is fine, she just forgot to charge it and tried to turn it on

[12:07:13] simonstewart: :)
[12:07:15] simonstewart: Quite possibly
[12:07:33] AutomatedTester: it says "Show low battery logo" at the top instead of actually showing a logo
[12:07:41] simonstewart: Ah.
[12:07:43] AutomatedTester: it has the TEXT "Show low battery logo"
[12:07:44] simonstewart: Hahahahahaha

[12:17:03] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I am trying to ENV[:method].to_s and its not happy
[12:17:10] AutomatedTester: whats the best way to do this?
[12:17:52] andreastt: :method?  Why are you passing in a symbol?
[12:18:58] andreastt: ENV['ARG'] if you want ARG's value.
[12:18:59] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I want to have an arg in crazyfun
[12:19:07] AutomatedTester: ooo
[12:19:28] *AutomatedTester was using simonstewart's ruby
[12:20:50] andreastt: Even if a document doesn't have a script runtime, we shouldn't necessarily have to throw on attempting to init it at page load?
[12:21:04] andreastt: It would make sense to throw when not being able to eval on a page, though.
[12:21:08] AutomatedTester: andreastt: so if ENV['method']? doX end

[13:22:19] simonstewart: os.arch should be it
[13:22:30] simonstewart: Though that's why we have the Platform enum
[13:22:43] andreastt: It returns ia32 on Open and i386 on Oracle for 32-bit Linux.

[13:23:22] simonstewart: It could
[13:23:35] andreastt: I'm considering looking at that now.
[13:23:52] andreastt: Because the alternative is to balance between os.arch and sun.arch.data.model.

[14:40:13] simonstewart: That was fixed ages ago
[14:40:17] simonstewart: 2.12?
[14:40:19] simonstewart: Something like that
[14:40:26] mattsmith: not sure if it's the java certs or the villancert
[14:41:02] mattsmith: I may be barking up the wrong tree completely
[14:41:15] mattsmith: but just seems weird how yesterday it was working 
[14:41:52] jimevans: well, i find it's a good resource, mostly, and i love that it's overpowering sites like expertsexchange.com for open q & a. it's gotten really big, though, and the quality of question is such that i'm not sure the community is as good about policing that as was the original vision.
[14:42:35] RossPatterson: Indeed, the question quality has gone to almost 0 in the last few years.
[14:42:54] RossPatterson: I REALLY want a way to hide questions from anyone with <100 reputation :-)
[14:42:58] RossPatterson: Or even <10
[14:43:23] jimevans: on the other hand, i'm only about 300 shy of the 3000 rep threshold, and i do have one of the three WebDriver badges awarded, so there's that. :)
[14:43:44] simonstewart: I should probably get in on that game
[14:43:48] RossPatterson: There are WebDriver badges?  Why was I not informed of this?
[14:44:00] jimevans: there are topic-based badges.

[15:00:47] mattsmith: cool

[15:02:28] mattsmith: :-) thats ok, no offence taken
[15:02:29] simonstewart: This way we can scale horizontally
[15:02:41] simonstewart: Need more capacity? Just add new machines to the build grid
[15:02:54] mattsmith: sounds good
[15:03:31] AutomatedTester: mattsmith: also its a cleaner approach to testing
[15:03:47] AutomatedTester: some browsers dont have good cleanup mechanisms

[15:03:58] simonstewart: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M47-FGvVJx0
[15:04:11] mattsmith: don't think we are at that scale at the moment to worry about swamping 
[15:04:15] AutomatedTester: yay... test failing for the right reason
[15:04:33] simonstewart: If you run more tests than you have nodes on the grid, you can swamp the grid
[15:04:44] RossPatterson: "find . -type d -empty | sort r | xargs rmdir" ought to have done it in a single pass
[15:04:57] mattsmith: AutomatedTester, so you guys also provision vm's
[15:05:04] simonstewart: But there are empty directories that only contain other directories
[15:05:04] AutomatedTester: mattsmith: we are heading that way
[15:05:20] mattsmith: how long does it take to provision the VM?
[15:05:33] simonstewart: Depends on how loaded the machine is
[15:05:37] simonstewart: But can be ~30 seconds
[15:05:41] AutomatedTester: if you are just spinning up a snapshot then can be quick
[15:05:42] simonstewart: We're just starting a snapshot of a VM
[15:05:45] mattsmith: thats pretty sweet

[15:58:53] simonstewart: Right

[16:01:40] jimevans: i'm completely unsurprised that there are memory leaks, and i now have a clear repro case that demonstrates the difference in the IE driver vs. manual.
[16:02:21] jimevans: i'm more than willing to bet that at least some of those are references to stale elements we keep around because we don't know enough to discard them when the page refreshes.
[16:02:31] jimevans: and that's a problem the injected atoms solves very nicely.
[16:03:24] simonstewart: Nice
[16:03:46] jimevans: o

[19:58:03] santiycr: there's some weird interaction between the selenium proxy and FF>12
[19:58:15] klrmn: oooooh
[19:58:17] santiycr: it's in m list for next week to resolve it
[19:58:31] stephend: oh
[19:58:31] santiycr: for some reason firefox doesn't like the http proxy in selenium
[19:58:31] lth: santiycr: fantastic!
[19:58:32] stephend: good to know
[19:58:34] _6a68: santiyctr: is there a public bug tracker so we can watch that bug?
[19:58:35] santiycr: and takes minutes to proxy
[19:58:39] santiycr: you can workaround it!
[19:58:43] stephend: yeah, that's exactly what we're seeing
[19:58:45] lth: santiycr: that diagnosis explains the data extremely well.
[19:58:46] klrmn: yay workarounds!
[19:59:02] santiycr: I haven't reported it yet, as I haven't had the time to investigate it enough 
[19:59:17] lth: santiycr: perform a couple http requests before page load?
[19:59:30] *lth stops guessing
[19:59:30] santiycr: sauce proxies through selenium by default, to be able to support any self-signed certificate transparently
[19:59:49] eanxgeek: Dude-X: thanks I'll take a look
[19:59:50] santiycr: you can use "avoid-proxy": true, as a capability, which makes saucy skip the proxying
[19:59:53] *eanxgeek enters new territory

[20:00:07] santiycr: lth:  I'm considering that between my options
[20:00:08] lth: aha, all our certs are legit!  and this will probably be a good thing to do generally
[20:00:09] stephend: that might get us in trouble -- we self-sign a lot
[20:00:17] stephend: or, I guess, not in browserid-land
[20:00:21] santiycr: I'm thinking I'll be smarter, and stop proxying for browsres that don't really need it
[20:00:23] _6a68: lth: will that break sauce vs ephemeral testing?
[20:00:33] santiycr: depending on the selenium proxy has only brought us pain
[20:00:34] lth: _6a68: ephemerals have legit certs
[20:00:39] _6a68: niiiice
[20:00:58] lth: _6a68: self-signed certs cause too many bug reports, so we either use http or spend the cash
[20:01:07] _6a68: ftmfw
[20:01:11] santiycr: well, firefox and chrome don't really need to be proxied 
[20:01:26] santiycr: Se devs are awesome and built this inside the drivers
[20:01:46] santiycr: I haven't done my investigation yet, but my guess is most browsers can do this except for IE
[20:01:48] *klrmn sits and listens before strategizing the solution
[20:02:14] santiycr: so browsers will take invalid certificates without issues
[20:02:30] _6a68: santiycr where would we specify that avoid-proxy arg in a sauce call?
[20:02:34] stephend: santiycr: do you need a sauce or selenium issued filed?
[20:02:39] stephend: i could definitely file the sauce issue
[20:02:41] santiycr: therefore, we're just introducing yet another possibility of breakage unnecessarily 
[20:02:59] santiycr: saue issue would work
[20:03:02] stephend: will do
[20:03:08] santiycr: http://support.saucelabs.com/
[20:03:18] santiycr: it'll make it easier for me to follow up when it's out there
[20:03:20] _6a68: stephend: mind pinging #identity with the ticket number?
[20:03:38] santiycr: _6a68:  just drop that in the desired capabilities 
[20:03:58] _6a68: santiycr: I don't know quite where that is yet, but I can read the fine manual
[20:04:09] _6a68: or maybe klrmn | stephend have a better idea
[20:04:34] _6a68: santiycr: thanks a lot for the help!
[20:04:49] santiycr: _6a68:  should be where the webdriver instance gets instantiated 
[20:04:53] santiycr: you're welcome :)
[20:04:55] _6a68: ok, cool.
[20:05:04] santiycr: I'm guessing you're using python, so it should look something like this:
[20:05:07] _6a68: I think klrmn will look, she's leaps and bounds ahead of me on this bidness
[20:05:10] _6a68: yeah, python
[20:05:11] stephend: _6a68: sure, gimme a few to file
[20:05:13] santiycr: desired_capabilities['avoid-proxy'] = True
[20:05:20] _6a68: santiycr: awesome. /me greps
[20:06:00] *santiycr found ends up using ack/grep more than vim nowadays
[20:06:21] _6a68: heh
[20:07:17] klrmn: santiycr: gotta figure out if davehunt has plumbed in a way to pass capabilities through pytest-mozwebqa or if i'm going to have to update that too
[20:07:36] santiycr: cool
[20:07:51] santiycr: feel free to ping me if I can be useful 
[20:08:21] klrmn: ok, the plugin accepts capabilities in json format
[20:08:25] stephend: klrmn: yeah, you can pass them in
[20:08:37] stephend: we can arbitrarily specify selenium versions through sauce in JSOn
[20:08:42] stephend: oh, you said that
[20:08:43] *stephend sucks
[20:08:52] _6a68: klrmn: nice. does that mean we can pass it via the command line to pytest?
[20:08:59] _6a68: stephend: ^^
[20:09:03] klrmn: _6a68: in theory, yes =)
[20:09:20] stephend: here's an example: py.test tests/desktop/ -rsx -n 12 --destructive --api=webdriver --browsername=firefox --browserver=13 --platform="Windows 2008" --webqatimeout=180 --baseurl=http://support.allizom.org --junitxml=results.xml --credentials=/Users/webqa/webqa-credentials/sumo.yaml --saucelabs=/Users/webqa/webqa-credentials/sauce_labs.yaml --capabilities='{"selenium-version":"2.25.0"}' --build=${BUILD_TAG}
[20:09:30] *stephend should've just provided a snippet
[20:09:32] _6a68: wow, youre quick
[20:09:42] *_6a68 tries on our jenkins instance
[20:10:45] eanxgeek: Any python guys here that could possibly take a look at https://gist.github.com/3361694, give me some idea of why I can't seem to get any org unless that org is the first.
[20:12:06] _6a68: stephend: so this would work? —capabilities='{"avoid-proxy":"true"}'?
[20:12:18] _6a68: I wouldn't normally wrap a boolean in quotes, but since it's not really javascript, wasn't sure
[20:12:36] _6a68: or would it be True not "true" since it's python?
[20:13:04] klrmn: it needs to be a json formatted true
[20:13:30] _6a68: klrmn: so it could be either true or "true"
[20:13:50] _6a68: like, either the javascript boolean literal or the quoted string (which, as a nonempty string, always coerces to the boolean true :-p)
[20:14:18] klrmn: quoted string i think…lower case
[20:14:29] stephend: don't ask the pointy-hair about JSON ;-)
[20:14:31] klrmn: note: we need to put this only on the firefox browser defs, not the general def
[20:14:31] stephend: heh
[20:14:52] _6a68: stephend: heh
[20:14:55] _6a68: klrmn: cool, noted
[20:15:25] _6a68: oh, F it all. jenkins 500 error.
[20:18:59] stephend: those are fun
[20:19:33] klrmn: _6a68, stephend: PASSED: 2008_firefox_13/123done
[20:19:55] stephend: cool
[20:20:02] _6a68: stephend: any attempts to change jenkins config are 500ing for me.
[20:20:08] _6a68: do you have any jobs on ci.mozilla?
[20:20:20] klrmn: trying vista_firefox_13
[20:20:28] stephend: yeah, but let's take it to a mozilla channel :-)
