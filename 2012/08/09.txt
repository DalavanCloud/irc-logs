[09:54:08] alexluya: where to download
[09:56:20] barancev: oh, hi, freynaud! do you know requiredCapabilities was introduced? shouldn't we change the prioritizer accordingly?
[09:56:45] barancev: alexluya: download selenium-server-standalone-2.2.5.0.jar and add it to the classpath
[09:56:49] freynaud: what do you mean?
[09:56:55] Swadq has joined #selenium
[09:57:09] freynaud: for grid, it's always been required

[09:57:37] freynaud: is you ask for something, you're guaranteed to have at least that
[09:58:22] barancev: always required? nice! so, the answer is probably 'no, we don't need to fix the prioritizer'

[10:36:08] barancev: freynaud: here
[10:36:24] freynaud: I missed the desired / required discussion
[10:36:36] freynaud: in grid, why would we use desired at all
[10:37:11] barancev: a user is allowed to specify only one of this capabilities
[10:37:22] freynaud: for me, the required, what used to be the "desired" cap, it what makes the test reproduceable
[10:37:25] barancev: may be we have to merge them?
[10:37:29] freynaud: anything else is not really relevant
[10:37:50] freynaud: i would read from required only instead of desired
[10:38:04] freynaud: that's always how grid was designed
[10:38:15] freynaud: if you say : browserName=IE, you need an IE
[10:38:32] freynaud: if something isn't important, like the version, you can leave it blank
[10:38:42] barancev: I'm totally for 'required only', I don't like the idea of 'give me this browser, and if it is not present -- give me some other browser'
[10:38:59] barancev: i'd like desiredCapabilities to be completely removed
[10:39:13] santiycr: new environments are ready at Sauce Labs
[10:39:58] freynaud: barancev: the solution for grid and the exotic request should be : change the capabilityMatcher
[10:39:59] barancev: santiycr: thanks!
[10:40:07] santiycr: Firefox up to 15b3, Opera 11 and 12 in all OSes, Chrome 21 (with the approrpriate chromedriver!!
[10:40:25] barancev: yahoo! opera on windows is available!
[10:40:45] freynaud: the idea behind that was to provide a way for : give me a firefox with version = 3.6.* for instance
[10:40:57] santiycr: freynaud, barancev: FWIW, that's exactly how the sauce cloud works as well
[10:41:40] barancev: santiycr: re chromedriver: there are reports that versions 21 and 22 are not stable with Chrome 21, see #4363

[10:42:36] Bebe_sel has joined #selenium
[10:43:25] barancev: freynaud: yes, yes, I'm with you, I'm for striktness of capabilities specified, but...
[10:43:38] freynaud: does anyone see an issue with changing the /grid/api/hub/* API. It's not documented so I'm assuming it's not used
[10:44:13] barancev: now we have 'desired' and 'required' with different semantics
[10:44:48] andreastt: Wohoo \o/
[10:44:53] andreastt: santiycr: I've located the issue!
[10:45:04] andreastt: That only took two days of debugging.
[10:45:23] santiycr: andreastt:  sorry, with better logs from Sauce, probably would have saved you some time
[10:45:27] freynaud: barancev: I don't get the desired piece. If it's not really needed, why should a test provide it ? It seems like a reciepe for not reproduce able failures to me
[10:45:52] santiycr: barancev:  thanks for the heads up on the chromedriver issues. We're using 21.0.1180.4
[10:45:53] barancev: I totally agee
[10:46:26] santiycr: barancev:  hoping we don't start seeing issues like this
[10:47:09] santiycr: FWIW, our full test suite has been running on Chrome 21 and ChromeDriver 21 for a couple of days, all seems fine in our servers
[10:47:10] barancev: I think we should wait and watch
[10:47:26] santiycr: fingers crossed
[10:48:21] barancev: chromedriver 21 was known for chromedriver#99 , that's why 22 was released

[10:49:43] santiycr: the fact that it was only released for Windows and that it didn't respect the versioning pattern made me skip it

[10:51:25] barancev: do you know why googlecode opens some pages as text/plain? e.g. http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_IE_InternetExplorerDriverService.htm
[10:52:21] santiycr: no clue 
[10:52:29] santiycr: cuz their usability sucks?
[10:53:04] santiycr: I guess they don't assume .htm endings as html files?
[10:53:36] barancev: other similar are OK -- http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_IE_InternetExplorerDriver.htm
[10:54:36] santiycr: oh wow
[10:55:02] santiycr: maybe the html in the first one is invalid
[10:56:15] barancev: no, sir! when I open the same file from the local disk it's OK
[10:57:06] barancev: googlecode writes 'Content-Type: text/plain' in HTTP header for this file, how does it do it?
[10:57:27] barancev: some heuristics?
[10:58:25] santiycr: I think it puts it in a magic bag full of rainbows and numbers and then pulls it out straight to your browser
[10:58:33] santiycr: I'm quite sure that's how search works

[11:34:45] andreastt: We're using OpenJDK for everything at Opera, so that's why it was working for us but not you or Google.

[12:31:36] RossPatterson: bodziec: That's intentional.
[12:32:09] bodziec: thx RossPatterson 
[12:32:22] bodziec: so is it possible to search relative to element?
[12:34:30] amitev has joined #selenium
[12:34:38] RossPatterson: Yup.  Just like XPath says, start with "./", not "//".
[12:34:44] andreastt: :note santiycr Can you update this? http://saucelabs.com/docs/ondemand/browsers  What are the exact Opera versions and keys you allow?
[12:34:45] selbot2_: ok!
[12:34:46] RossPatterson: Or rather, ".//"
[12:35:04] bodziec: thx RossPatterson 
[12:35:13] bodziec: i tried it this way
[12:35:28] bodziec: i'm beginning to think that it may be something else
[12:35:33] RossPatterson: FWIW, I believe this is wrong behavior, but it was actively debated and decided.
[12:35:57] RossPatterson: Really?  You tried By.xpath(".//div/td") and it didn't work?
[12:36:02] bodziec: yes
[12:36:14] bodziec: this is a gwt app
[12:36:33] bodziec: i'm beginning to think that it is a more complicated logic
[12:36:54] bodziec: there's lots of javascript involved
[12:36:54] RossPatterson: Ah.  I hate GWT.  And any other framework that tries to assemble elements *similar* to HTML elements using DIVs.
[12:37:03] RossPatterson: Yes there is.
[12:37:26] bodziec: but thanks at least now I know the behaviour
[12:37:34] RossPatterson: But findElements() should find anything that exists, even if you can't interact with it in the way you expect.

[14:52:15] andreastt: Okay, so given that that file exists on your local system, is the driver meant to upload the file if it's an INPUT @type="file" field, and type the keys as usual if it's not?
[14:53:00] adamgoucher: jimevans: 'webdriver' or 'remote webdriver' -- or both?

[14:55:30] cmcgraw: andreastt: we're suddenly having issues with our file uploads too.  Something that many people trip over is that the file selector dialog that pops up doesn't actually do anything special other than setting the path.  The actual upload is (usually) done by some other action.
[14:55:50] adamgoucher: andreastt: i believe it is up to the user to move the file there. though, look at webelement.py:send_keys -- it'll copy that file over the wire it looks like

[17:23:59] Dude-X: yeah
[17:24:16] detronizator: and given that I'm hacking around a PhantomJSDriver class in Java, I was curious if I should stick to "Capabilities" class
[17:24:26] detronizator: or come up with my own stuff
[17:24:56] Dude-X: webdriver spec has a capabliities class that is split into desired and required
[17:25:37] detronizator: Dude-X: yep - to configure a RemoteWebDriver subclass, that is tuned for PhantomJS
[17:25:58] detronizator: should I stick with Caps and Descaps? I suppose your it's a yes

[17:26:50] detronizator: jimevans: reasoning?

[17:31:54] detronizator: andreastt: well, they are marking as "deprecated" methods of the ChromeDriver class that accepts caps
[17:32:08] andreastt: Much the same approach I've taken with OperaDriver, which converts all capabilities in OperaSettings.  Only difference being I haven't exposed the OperaSettings class.
[17:32:13] andreastt: jimevans: Ah, okay.
[17:32:27] andreastt: Then it's not much the same.
[17:32:28] jimevans: you create a ChromeOptions instance, and pass it to the ChromeDriver constructor, which then convert to capabilities before passing along to the actual driver.
[17:33:00] andreastt: Is it just meant to make Java development easier?
[17:33:03] detronizator: jimevans: andreastt: cool - so I guess for now I'll stick with handling capabilities
[17:33:14] detronizator: and later on I can be nice and offer options and option->caps caonverter
[17:33:17] jimevans: i can't speak for Java, but for .NET that's exactly the reason.
[17:33:28] andreastt: Right.
[17:34:33] detronizator: jimevans: btw, as having a "master of driver" writing a binding for GhostDriver can be a real helper for a "newbie" like me, are you writing that in the open? hosting it somewhere where I can copy?
[17:34:42] detronizator: (shameless)
[17:35:03] jimevans: detronizator: if you're willing to translate from C# to Java, sure! :)
[17:35:30] jimevans: (which is why i keep harping on wanting a fixed windows build for phantomjs)
[17:35:32] detronizator: windows dudes tell me that C# is just Java from Microsoft: shouldn't be hard to figure out :P
[17:36:17] jimevans: i prefer to think of it as "Java done better"‚Ä¶ :-P
[17:37:11] detronizator: jimevans: lol
[17:37:21] detronizator: jimevans: anyway, keep me posted about that
[17:37:25] jimevans: will do.
[17:37:55] detronizator: jimevans: ah, I was thinking even - we could have the bindings living in a subdir of the ghostdriver repo
[17:37:56] teodosia_sel has left #selenium
[17:38:28] detronizator: jimevans: only thing: I'd love to figure out a way to build them a publish them on something like Maven repo central or whatever sorcery C# people use
[17:38:33] jimevans: that's an idea. i eventually want the bindings to live with webdriver, and deprecate HtmlUnit. :)
[17:39:01] jimevans: detronizator: nuget is probably the most-used package manager.
[17:39:38] detronizator: do you publish the C# selenium bindings there? or someone does?
[17:39:46] jimevans: yes, i do.
[17:40:00] jimevans: there's a "go" build target that handles it.
[17:42:11] jimevans: hmm‚Ä¶ i don't see how this test could possibly pass.

[17:45:09] dennis_: Do you have a way to get focus back?
[17:45:19] jimevans: all the driver is doing in that case is executing some javascript under the covers. it shouldn't be dropping the window to the bottom of the z-order, yet it is.

[19:18:21] detronizator: jimevans: hey - what kind of "strategy" are you planning to use when running GhostDriver in terms of instances? 1 per Driver instance?
[19:18:32] detronizator: jimevans: and what about the port assignment?
[19:19:03] detronizator: jimevans: I'll leave IRC open. If you have an answer at some point, I'll read it later - dinner time :)
[19:19:51] jimevans: detronizator: for the former, i hadn't thought that far ahead. i didn't know if you supported multiple sessions in the same phantomjs instance. in the interim, i was planning on just having one driver per instance.
[19:20:13] jimevans: for the latter, i was going to choose a random port, similar to the way the IE and Chrome drivers do now.
[19:22:32] detronizator: jimevans: ghostdriver DOES support multiple sessions. BUT, and that's a big one, I have noticed phantomjs "explosions" when I have too many session, even when those get closed.
[19:22:53] detronizator: I suspect Mongoose it's to blame: it's just too "simple and poor" - the weakest part of phantomjs at the moment
[19:23:14] jimevans: it's the weakest part of all of the drivers that use it, i suspect.
[19:23:18] detronizator: jimevans: about the random port selection -  is there a pointer to the actual algorithm you guys use?
[19:23:33] detronizator: what other browser uses Mongoose?
[19:23:56] detronizator: (pizza is late, so I'm still here as you noticed :) )
[19:24:03] jimevans: for .NET, i simply attempt to connect to a socket on port 0, and it returns a valid, unused port.
[19:24:14] jimevans: IE and Chrome both use mongoose.
[19:25:14] detronizator: jimevans: crashy for you too?
[19:25:49] jimevans: not crashy, but i definitely don
[19:25:54] jimevans: don't use keep-alive.
[19:27:05] jimevans: i'm toying with the idea of removing HTTP as the transport mechanism altogether in the IE driver.
[19:27:39] detronizator: myself I was considering using the Qt HTTP classes and be done with it
[19:28:03] detronizator: as per keep-alive, we do use that!
[19:28:05] detronizator: crap
[19:28:40] detronizator: last thing: about the port selection, I need to investigate that approach - didn't know I could do that (my CompSci profs will probably punch me in the face now)
[19:28:59] jimevans: when i was looking for an HTTP server, i wanted lightweight. didn't want a huge dependency like Qt. you've already got it as a dependency so it might make sense for you.
[19:29:26] jimevans: i'm not sure if that's a sockets thing or just the .net socket library.
[19:30:49] jimevans: but i believe the java sockets library has something similar. check out the selenium PortProber class.

[20:57:28] klrmn: Dude-X: yes, i'm really wishing ActionChains supported .text ‚Ä¶ because i'm fairly sure the reason for the timing issue is because it's text exposed by a hover
[20:57:29] jimevans: klrmn: you're asking me? you're seeing it as a global problem?
[20:57:56] klrmn: jimevans: this is the first time i've tried to validate text hiden by a hover, as opposed to clicking on a link hiden by a hover
[20:58:21] jimevans: update your standalone server, see if it helps.
[20:58:24] klrmn: jimevans: perhaps your 'which version' question was not meant for me
[20:58:36] jimevans: klrmn: no, in fact, it was not.
[20:58:45] barancev: klrmn: getText returns an empty string for an invisible element, by design
[20:59:48] jimevans: there were some hover changes in the standalone server that might solve the issue.
[20:59:54] klrmn: barancev: thank you for the clarification
[20:59:56] Dude-X: klrmn: is it a css:hover or an event hover()

[21:00:02] klrmn: jimevans: awesome, downloading now
[21:00:10] jimevans: no promises though. :)
[21:00:27] klrmn: Dude-X: i'm not sure if i know how to tell the difference
[21:00:54] Dude-X: if jquery.hover() doesn't work, it's a css hover
[21:02:18] klrmn: Dude-X: uh, i don't know how to make that statement apply to a particular item on the page‚Ä¶.not a big js user
[21:02:57] Dude-X: try it in the console of the browser, if yo use jquery (or use opera's inspector which includes jquery)

[21:03:53] Dude-X: my test suite kind of works on opera but lots of xpaths fail for some reason
[21:04:32] klrmn: Dude-X: i know how to get the console for firefox, but there are at minimum 20 things on this page that do hovers, and i don't know how to do it to the right one
[21:04:55] Dude-X: same way you would select it in webdriver!
[21:05:08] Dude-X: i assume you know hte locator somehow
[21:05:14] Dude-X: unless you copy and paste from a tool :/
[21:07:05] klrmn: Dude-X: do you mean something like "jquery.hover('div#id > span.class')"?
[21:07:41] AutomatedTester: $("div#id > span.class').hover
[21:07:44] AutomatedTester: klrmn: ^ try that
[21:07:58] klrmn: thanks AutomatedTester, didn't see you there =)
[21:08:11] *AutomatedTester goes and lurks in the background again
[21:08:15] Dude-X: what AT said
[21:08:34] AutomatedTester: $("div#id > span.class').hover()
[21:08:39] AutomatedTester: missed the ()
[21:08:45] Dude-X: with jquery you can do $j('jquerySelector').click() ; .focus(), .hover()
[21:09:06] Dude-X: jquerySelectors are like css selectors
[21:09:25] AutomatedTester: note the "like"
[21:09:43] AutomatedTester: they have extra items on top
[21:09:51] klrmn: whee! i get to figure out which li item it is
[21:10:41] Dude-X: $j() is like find_elements
[21:10:49] AutomatedTester: argg getting ill
[21:11:06] Dude-X: always returns an array (like a python list)
[21:12:53] hourback1 has joined #selenium
[21:14:58] klrmn: $j is not defined, it tells me
[21:16:54] klrmn: so, this exercise is supposed to tell me if it's a css:hover or an event hover‚Ä¶how does that change things with regards to webdriver and ActionChains?
[21:19:55] AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
[21:25:31] Dude-X: klrmn: opera has jquery built in; but either way; actionchains will work with hover stuff, only by executing javascript can you deal with CSS effects
[21:25:42] Dude-X: aka pseudo selectors
[21:29:31] rpereir__ has joined #selenium
[21:31:42] klrmn: Dude-X: did i understand correctly that ActionChains only deals with hover events, not with css:hover?
[21:32:01] hourback1 has joined #selenium
[21:32:15] Dude-X: i think CSS hover should work properly with native events
[21:32:37] Dude-X: but not with javascript only actions aka synthetic events
[21:33:03] klrmn: *nod* i'm seeing the hover thing open, i just don't think it's staying open long enough to keep the text i'm trying to fetch visible
[21:33:27] Dude-X: oh‚Ä¶ interesting
[21:34:16] Dude-X: i recall seeing that mouseover doesn't stick too long in the issues tracker

[21:36:42] barancev: it will be in 2.26
[21:37:11] barancev: and don't ask me 'when 2.26?' :)
[21:37:23] AutomatedTester: barancev: i think its only in 2.26 for IE
[21:37:23] Dude-X: when the builds are green or simon pulls out the whip
[21:37:32] klrmn: Dude-X: it looks like upgrading the selenium standalone to 2.25 fixed it
[21:37:50] Dude-X: cool
[21:38:26] barancev: in FF -- yes, 2.25, in IE -- wait for 2.26 to be landed
[21:38:45] jimevans: guys, the change for IE was server-side. it should already be landed.

[21:39:36] AutomatedTester: arggg. thats got worse
[21:39:41] jimevans: the point being that if you update IEDriverServer.exe to 2.25.3, you should pick up the changes.
[21:39:43] AutomatedTester: who has been committing code
[21:39:47] jimevans: me.

[21:40:42] barancev: hover is fixed, but DnD broken
[21:40:52] *AutomatedTester finally got round to trying to claim back missing miles
[21:41:03] jimevans: my changes were limited to IE and .NET.
[21:41:11] AutomatedTester: dont people know I dont sit on plans for fun
[21:41:29] barancev: it's not getting worse
[21:41:40] AutomatedTester: oooo recruiter email
[21:41:48] AutomatedTester: and this sounds interesting 
[21:41:54] barancev: Opera is fixed
[21:41:55] AutomatedTester: Dev Evangelist
[21:43:20] barancev: FF10 is broken, that's strange
[21:45:01] barancev: but...
[21:45:14] barancev: yes, it's getting worse
[21:45:23] jimevans: the IE failures in the mouse tests are directly due to the "hover fix". we get extra mouse events, and those tests are looking for an exact match instead of using a regex.
[21:45:58] barancev: javascript tests started to fail
[21:47:31] barancev: or do they broken for long time? IE6 and FF3.6
[21:48:20] barancev: well, we need a stabilization round
[21:48:32] Dude-X: FF10 should get a lot of loving‚Ä¶ in the fall my test suite is going to switch from 3.6 to 10
[21:49:58] barancev: FF10 can't start, and there is no sauce job ID to see what's happening on the server side
