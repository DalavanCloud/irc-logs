[00:18:53] dawagner: Fuck maven.
[00:20:36] AutomatedTester: \o
[00:21:20] dawagner: Seriously, fuck maven.
[00:21:27] *AutomatedTester feels like he is >.< to marionette working on Firefox Mobile
[00:21:36] dawagner: Patching oscache is proving to be hard, because half of its dependencies no longer *exist* in maven.
[00:21:39] dawagner: Ooh! Exciting!
[00:21:55] *AutomatedTester has it packaged into Firefox Mobile
[00:22:02] AutomatedTester: now trying to solve the rest of the issues
[00:25:43] dawagner: Holy shit I think I've beaten The Maven
[00:25:57] AutomatedTester: with a big stick?
[00:26:43] dawagner: See also http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=mBmExt184vc
[00:36:45] dawagner: :note lukeis I think I have an oscache which doesn't depend on swing.  It didn't need to depend on swing.  At all.  I'll give it a try.

[16:40:43] pukerat: I was using a webdriverwait to check displayed conditions of an element for the purpose of polling
[16:41:22] pukerat: under certain race conditions, the event that would remove the element occurs inbetween the function that finds the element and the check if it is 'displayed'
[16:42:11] pukerat: .displayed says it will throw staleelementexception so I added that to the ignore exception lists for the wait but infact it throws targetinvocation exceptions because reflection is used within .displayed

[17:24:31] lukeis: no real jsp code either is being used
[17:24:49] lukeis: the site is just so basic :)
[17:25:01] dawagner: Indeed :)
[17:25:10] lukeis: (and I updated the only thing that used that caching thing to do it's own local cache)
[17:26:15] lukeis: really i need to wire in something like Wikimedia that I've been wanting to do and replace the rst crap
[17:26:25] KaibutsuX: is it possible to retrieve d.page_source as it was loaded without any js manipulations to the DOM?
[17:26:57] lukeis: not via selenium... put a proxy in place to record the html that came across

[17:27:25] lukeis: jarib: can't use heroku
[17:27:38] lukeis: (it's not free to anyone here)
[17:27:52] jarib: jekyll is a static site generator, you can host it anywhere

[17:33:43] jarib: also supports dropping a CNAME in there for custom domains
[17:34:00] lukeis: oh, freynaud's here :) I wanted to ask your talk for the mobile summit, is it nativedriver or something else?
[17:34:02] davehunt: I was playing around with adding Opera mobile to the grid, and had an issue where I want to add capabilities at the hub rather than when running the test. A bit like the firefox_binary capability. Do you think it makes sense to make this more generic?
[17:36:02] freynaud: lukeis: smth else
[17:36:30] davehunt: also, if andreastt is here, I couldn't get Opera Mobile Emulator to start without the initial device selection window
[17:36:43] freynaud: lukeis: i use the UIAutomation frmk from apple for the click, and make it understand the selenium protocol
[17:37:05] lukeis: awesome.... that was something I was going to look into ;)
[17:37:20] freynaud: davehunt: playing with capabilities seems dangerous
[17:37:36] davehunt: freynaud: something like: after matching, add any additional capabilities from the matched node_config.json to the request unless they're already set
[17:37:42] jlaska has joined #selenium
[17:37:49] davehunt: freynaud: dangerous how?
[17:38:24] freynaud: davehunt: anytime I tried to make something clever with the configuration, it fired back badly. Dangerous that way :)
[17:38:37] davehunt: I can't see any other way, other than setting capabilities at the test runner, but you wouldn't know binary locations for specific nodes
[17:39:04] freynaud: davehunt: it makes total sense for ff binary and things like that
[17:39:23] davehunt: opera.product and opera.binary are the ones I was trying to set
[17:39:27] freynaud: davehunt: but that would make the miss configuration terrible
[17:39:57] freynaud: lukeis: are you playing with mobile ?

[17:49:31] davehunt: andreastt: Mac OS X 10.8
[17:49:55] andreastt: Right, then it should work to set opera.binary to /Applications/Opera Mobile Emulator.app
[17:50:24] andreastt: If that fails, inside that package there are two binaries.  One in the usual location (being the profile selector thingie), and another (the actual browser) inside the Resources directory.
[17:50:31] davehunt: that complained that it was a folder, so I did /Applications/Opera Mobile Emulator.app/Content/MacOS/Opera Mobile Emulator
[17:50:50] andreastt: Yeah, that's the profile thing.
[17:50:59] davehunt: ah okay, let me take another look :)
[17:50:59] andreastt: The other should be in /Resources somewhere.

[17:52:02] davehunt: If I can get this hooked up the the Grid I'll write a blog post ;)
[17:52:19] KaibutsuX: lukeis: are they an references available on how to use a proxy with selenium, I would like a standard one like urllib
[17:52:26] davehunt: having other issues with capabilities though (I'd like to set some of them on the hub)
[17:53:00] lukeis: KaibutsuX: browsermob-proxy is the standard one recommended
[17:53:22] andreastt: davehunt: Hm, okay.  When this stuff gets into the official Mobile builds, it should be enough to set opera.product to "mobile", though.
[17:53:36] andreastt: Let me know if you have any issues I can sort out though (-:
[17:53:51] davehunt: yeah, I'd like to set that on the hub rather than have the test runner set that
[17:54:21] davehunt: imo it should be enough for the test runner to set browserName = opera and platform = android
[17:54:28] KaibutsuX: im seeing some references: http://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/1276/is-there-a-capturenetworktraffic-implementation-in-selenium-2-via-webdriver
[17:54:44] davehunt: looks like this might work: "/Applications/Opera Mobile Emulator.app/Contents/Resources/Opera Mobile.app/Contents/Resources"
[17:54:44] KaibutsuX: but there is no method, "setCapability" in DesiredCapabilities
[17:54:46] andreastt: davehunt: I'm not terribly familiar with Grid, so I might've gotten some things wrong.
[17:55:21] davehunt: andreastt: I think it's just not currently supported. There's a special case for Firefox binary, but I think we need to make it more generic
[17:58:10] andreastt: davehunt: Well, re. platform, we want to be able to run it both on an Android device and an Android emulator, as well as just using the plain Opera Mobile emulator.  So we need to have a think about how to do it best.

[17:59:30] davehunt: andreastt: you would just register the type that you have/want and grid would pass it on. If you wanted to differentiate then I guess you'd need another capability
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Aug 31 18:00:04 2012]
[18:00:04] davehunt: but the default capability matcher just matches on browser name, version, and platform afaict
[18:01:03] davehunt: I'm thinking a deviceType should be standard. With values such as mobile, tablet, mobileEmulator perhaps
[18:01:55] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[18:02:33] andreastt: Yeah, I just saw that the iPhoneDriver was using that the other day.
[18:02:37] andreastt: Agreed, though.
[18:07:58] freynaud: davehunt: the default matcher is not great
[18:08:19] freynaud: it's easy to change, but hard to find some real requirement that work
[18:08:59] davehunt: freynaud: we should hack on this together. when are you free? :)
[18:10:47] freynaud: not in the next 30 min
[18:10:51] freynaud: but after that I'm ok
[18:11:00] freynaud: javadoc from the matcher : Default (naive) implementation of the capability matcher.
[18:11:08] freynaud: it says it all
[18:11:32] davehunt: heh, I didn't mean today - I'm leaving for the aiport soon
[18:11:37] davehunt: airport
[18:12:02] freynaud: we can work from the mozilla office sometimes in Sept
[18:12:22] davehunt: sounds good to me
[18:12:31] davehunt: we should also hack on the ESX stuff
[18:13:23] andreastt: Are you guys in London?
[18:13:31] freynaud: well, if your server is up we sure can
[18:13:35] freynaud: andreastt: ye
[18:13:50] davehunt: freynaud: I have it running in a VM now :P
[18:13:57] freynaud: sure :p
[18:15:38] davehunt: andreastt: '/Applications/Opera Mobile Emulator.app/Contents/Resources/Opera Mobile.app/Contents/MacOS/Opera Mobile' worked :)
[18:16:09] *davehunt tries running one of our test suites in Opera Mobile Emulator now

[19:05:23] AdrianG: i might know it
[19:05:27] AdrianG: just didnt know they call it like that
[19:05:33] AdrianG: ppl invent new words all the time.
[19:06:16] lukeis: i know tracking tools... but 'variance' ... when people make up shit in job descriptions that just says the corp lingo there is really messed up and will frustrate the hell out of me ;)
[19:07:35] lukeis: google is now telling me i don't care about variance tracking tools based on the varied results i just pulled up
