[03:05:52] rodrigues2k: Someone have some blogs, nice lectures, references in Selenium?
[03:06:44] Dude-X_: adam goucher's blog  element 34, mozilla qa has one
[03:09:52] rodrigues2k: thanks
[03:10:02] rodrigues2k: Im from Brazil and learning Webdriver
[03:12:44] rodrigues2k: In addition to Page Objects, is there any other design pattern widely used in automation with WebDriver?
[03:21:27] rodrigues2k has joined #selenium
[03:23:55] Dude-X_: rodrigues2k, hmm
[03:24:08] Dude-X_: the main thing is learning  what to wait on
[03:24:24] Dude-X_: create a wrapper for the driver object
[03:24:38] Dude-X_: so that it does waiting for you and all the loops that may be necessary
[03:24:44] Dude-X_: learn about WebDriverWait
[03:25:08] Dude-X_: and if you're dealingg with super Javascript widgets, you may have to execute Javascript to deal with those widgets
[03:25:09] rodrigues2k: yes. I learned implicity waits. but, now, I'm looking for a pattern to programming and maintain the code in a easier way
[03:25:17] Dude-X_: page objects are good
[03:25:42] Dude-X_: and also making a wrapper to the browser as well
[03:25:52] Dude-X_: err the driver
[03:26:11] rodrigues2k: hum
[03:26:30] Dude-X_: well that's all for now i can suggest, i am going to sleep
[03:26:37] rodrigues2k: do U have facebook?

[08:12:39] barancev|2: andreastt: opera is temorary off on CI
[08:13:07] andreastt: barancev: Okay, I'm looking into why it's failing now.
[08:14:37] barancev: andreastt: I'm afraid only santi can help, because there is no sause job ID in the log, and we can't analyze server log, hense
[08:15:07] andreastt: I'll try with a remote driver locally first, then I can investigate with a manual Sauce job.
[08:18:01] barancev: btw, I sometimes get (already reported somewhere) issue: when I run go test_opera it starts the browser but tests can't connect to it (it just waits with the "debug settings" page open ad runs nothing). I'm killing the browser, restarting the tests -- all right, works as expected. how can I diagnoze what's blocking it?
[08:18:52] andreastt: I'm not yet sure what causes that.
[08:19:01] andreastt: Maybe a timing issue related to service initialization or something.
[08:20:14] barancev: I want to do whatever I can to help you localize the root cause, but I don't know what to watch

[08:21:54] andreastt: That maybe some class in OperaDriver is too complex for the automatic bean converter.
[08:22:06] andreastt: That it needs a toJson() method or something.
[08:24:43] andreastt: Hm.  Not issues running single remote jobs either locally or on Sauce.

[08:29:11] andreastt: 0.15 I think.
[08:29:24] barancev: yes, 0.15 (from the CI point of view)

[14:38:32] sweetleaf: :P
[14:39:10] andreastt: It's a nice name. (-;
[14:43:47] sweetleaf: andreastt does this looks correct: return this.isElementPresent(By.cssSelector(".footer_item_happy_people_item span article#entry_17092"));
[14:45:17] andreastt: Oh, I was talking WebDriver.
[14:45:24] andreastt: I don't know Selenium 1 at all.
[14:45:44] sweetleaf: I am asking about webdriver
[14:46:53] andreastt: Well, the By selector looks okay.
[14:47:11] andreastt: I'm not sure if isElementPresent() takes the By type.
[14:47:28] jarib: sweetleaf: if the article has a unique id ("#entry_17092"), you can just use By.id
[14:47:30] sweetleaf: isElementPresent(By by) 
[14:47:50] andreastt: jarib speaks the truth.
[14:47:57] jarib: no need for the long selector
[14:48:16] andreastt: The same would apply for #artic above.
[14:48:21] andreastt: By.id("artic") would suffice.
[14:48:34] sweetleaf: I want to check if the "footer_item_happy_people_item" is present in the article with this specific id
[14:49:49] andreastt: Personally I'd do two checks.  One for whether the ID is present, the second for whichever element has .footer_item_happy_people_item present, and do an attribute check on that.
[14:54:23] sweetleaf: can we check with WebDriver javascript functions?

[18:00:41] detronizator: and that implements "/value" great!
[18:00:51] *AutomatedTester looks up /value

[18:02:08] AutomatedTester: detronizator: oo thats native events
[18:02:18] AutomatedTester: thats the actions api
[18:02:47] detronizator: I'm not sure I follow

[18:22:40] santiycr: hi emmasoderberg 
[18:22:57] emmasoderberg: hi satiycr
[18:22:58] santiycr: any news about FirefoxDriver and the failures in our side?
[18:23:08] santiycr: would love to help out investigating if it can be of use
[18:23:46] emmasoderberg: the failure on Friday for Firefox 12 was due to a missing guard against running some tests for remote
[18:24:35] emmasoderberg: that should be fixed now: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=17638
[18:24:54] santiycr: oh, awesome
[18:25:15] santiycr: was worried we were still off due to sauce's fault 
[18:25:15] emmasoderberg: the reason is that the server needs to pass on required capabilities given at creation of a new session but does not do that at the moment
[18:25:45] emmasoderberg: well I don't know what the current status of Firefox 10 is
[18:25:57] santiycr: so, client sends both req and desired caps and then server replies with the session and both required and desired back?
[18:27:08] nacho has joined #selenium
[18:27:26] emmasoderberg: almost, client sends both and the server should pass both on, but this it not the case now I think
[18:27:52] santiycr: I see. From my point of view, the server just reply with a single hash of "actualCapabilities"
[18:28:00] emmasoderberg: after a session is created a list of capabilities is returned (not divided into desired and required)
[18:28:05] *santiycr now goes to read the spec
[18:28:13] santiycr: ah, perfect
[18:28:28] emmasoderberg: yes, that should be inline with the spec
[18:28:31] santiycr: ok, I'm glad I had this right
[18:28:53] santiycr: ok, so sauce shouldn't be modifying responses from the server at all
[18:29:06] santiycr: seems like the firefox tests are disabled
[18:29:27] santiycr: wonder if these should be enabled now that your commit fixed the problem

[19:01:14] santiycr: where do i drop it?
[19:01:27] andreastt: Context?
[19:01:35] dawagner: santiycr: Hello! Any idea why https://saucelabs.com/jobs/fb3cf2d1515d47da9755884f31390ff8 is missing a log file?
[19:01:47] andreastt: dawagner: I tried looking into why the tests are failing on Opera on Sauce today.  They run perfectly fine when run from my workstation.
[19:02:16] dawagner: andreastt: Fun :S
[19:02:23] santiycr: the reason for which logs are not there, is because sauce tryies to be helpful and rerun the test in a new VM
[19:02:26] santiycr: this happens 3 times
[19:02:54] santiycr: the problem is that the architecture we decided to use doesn't allow us to save the assets from the last failure
[19:03:09] santiycr: therefore, all we can tell is "browser failed to start, 3 times in a row"
[19:03:21] dawagner: Is there any hacky way for me to get those logs?
[19:03:27] dawagner: We're trying to debug why firefox is crashing on start
[19:03:31] dawagner: Only on sauce
[19:03:37] santiycr: which rarely ever happens, except for you guys, which are actually playing with the browsers start and experimental selenium :)
[19:03:56] santiycr: yes, I've been working on a way
[19:04:11] santiycr: haven't been able to test it, but I can give it to you right now and hope it does

[21:33:45] sporkf: simonstewart: sure but we have to test on the same platform our customers use.
[21:34:08] simonstewart: Sure. But I'd host that in a VM rather than running natively
[21:39:08] AutomatedTester: yay.. the person who pushed 2 pushes before me set the Mozilla tree ablaze for mobile

[21:47:30] Ardesco: although would still require a manual update to repo map atm
[21:48:21] Ardesco: oh and only useful if you use maven
[21:48:27] *Ardesco watches half the room shudder
[21:48:29] Dude-X: honestly i'm not so hot about the idea of upgrading to the latest
[21:48:42] Dude-X: automatically
[21:48:59] Ardesco: that would never happen, you are always going to have to specify a version
[21:49:11] Dude-X: i see
[21:49:21] Dude-X: is this to get around maven?
[21:49:26] Ardesco: only way I could update the repo map is a new version of the plugin
[21:49:52] Ardesco: not to get around maven, its to provide a way to auto download the iedriver and google chrome executable
[21:50:28] Ardesco: using aven, it's a pain in the arse to have maven deal with all dependencies but still have a requirement to download an associated chromedriver executable
[21:50:32] Ardesco: *maven

[22:40:00] Dude-X: can marionnete can?
[22:40:10] AutomatedTester: I dont think Firefox supports that
[22:40:16] AutomatedTester: iirc its an IE thing
[22:40:26] Dude-X: that's what i thought too
[22:40:28] Dude-X: great
[22:40:31] AutomatedTester: :google window.showModalDialog

[22:41:21] AutomatedTester: its in Firefox
[22:41:50] AutomatedTester: and its being standardised in HTML5
[22:42:02] Dude-X: my project's code base doesn't use it but it's nice to know if selenium can handle it; i know IE driver can

[23:06:35] sawdog: I'm reading through the Selenium Docs (on chapt. 5 at the moment) - I'm not seeing anything surrounding User Auth -- we have a large number of web apps that I'm preparing to test which require auth.  Am I just jumping the gun - and will run across it in the docs soon enough?
[23:07:44] Dude-X: most websites have user authentication as a web page
[23:07:50] Dude-X: not as a modal dialog
[23:07:57] Dude-X: so at the moment there's no handling for this yet
[23:08:19] Dude-X: yet being the operative word...
[23:09:43] brokenthumbs has joined #selenium
[23:09:52] AutomatedTester: yet as it is a huge pain in the butt
[23:10:56] sawdog: so an IIS app which requires windows Auth and some AD role (using NTLM) is going to be an issue?
[23:11:17] Dude-X: is that a windows or an IE modal dialog?
[23:11:26] davehunt: sawdog: see #34
[23:11:27] selbot2_: 03simon.m.stewart open/accepted Support BASIC and Digest HTTP authentication - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=34 [Type-Enhancement Priority-Medium Component-WebDriver]
[23:11:28] Dude-X: if it's a windows modal dialog, you can probably use another tool for that
[23:11:44] davehunt: there are some workarounds mentioned
[23:11:59] sawdog: reading
[23:12:13] davehunt: oh wait, AD authentication may be different
[23:12:25] davehunt: that issue is regarding basic and digest

[23:39:08] sawdog: I was looking for phishy-userpass-length in my firefox about:config -- should I expect to see that there, or is this only something I'd be setting directly in my test setup?
[23:41:29] sawdog: looks like auth will work on the site using FF if I set the network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris and pass the user:pass@uri -- but the browser keeps prompting might be a trick.....and I need to click a dialog to continue
[23:41:31] Dude-X: is that  real setting?
[23:41:55] sawdog: it's not in my about:config settings, no
[23:43:28] sawdog: Dude-X: if I understand you correctly
[23:43:55] Dude-X: yea
[23:47:56] sawdog: if I add it to my config manually though, it works.  Cool.
[23:48:20] Dude-X: you can do it through webdriver too then
[23:49:06] sawdog: yeah, that'll work
