I found eric's patch, that should fix it (with using http://name:pw@url.de) but it won't work. Even then i will get the authenfication-dialog and can't fill anything in. There must be some stuff i am missing, but i can't seem to find it. Any help?

[10:52:59] testingb0t1: Search for "One nice feature of the remote webdriver is that exceptions often have an attached screen shot, encoded as a Base64 PNG. In order to get this screenshot, you need to write code similar to: â€¦."
[10:55:55] andref84: testingb0t1: so I need to do the screenshot myself

[10:56:29] testingb0t1: "exceptions often have an attached screen shot"

[11:02:25] andref84: it is not a way I would imagine of getting a screenshot
[11:02:31] testingb0t1: ok, just translate the java code on that page to python. it's basically a base64 decode of the exception string I believe, save it to an image file and it should work :)
[11:03:59] andref84: It is very uncomfortable way of getting the screenshot :)

[15:28:37] davehunt: 2.21.2 was released before Firefox 14, so it does not support it

[15:39:11] Dude-X: jimevans: but it's expensive to tear down the driver and start a new one :(

[16:31:47] DaveIngram: Does an element not automatically gain focus when you send keys to it?

[18:05:57] Videirovski: jimevans i havent made anything special, i have a global variable that indicates what browser the tests will be run, modify it to firefox and test have sucess, change that var to "internet explorer" and test stops when confirm dialog is presented, accept_Alert event arent working :S
[18:08:10] jimevans: Videirovski: the reason i'm asking is that the behavior your describing is consistent with using javascript to simulate a click on the element, rather than using native events. it might be interesting to bump up the logging for the IEDriverServer.exe to DEBUG or even TRACE and see what that tells you. Before you ask, no, i don't know how to do that in the php bindings.

[18:28:20] santiycr: emmasoderberg: how can I help you investigate?
[18:28:37] kennethk1ontz: Is it possible to use last-child or nth-child in browsers < ie9?
[18:29:06] Dude-X: nth-child maybe
[18:29:11] Dude-X: ie8 and ff3.6+
[18:29:35] Dude-X: kennethk1ontz: otherwise you might want to use a mix of css selectors and xpath
[18:29:57] emmasoderberg: santiycr: I'm on to the problem for firefox 12, the failure for firefox 10 is still unclear to me
[18:30:21] Dude-X: findElemenet('css').findElement('./div[%s]'.format(index)) or whatever
[18:31:18] kennethk1ontz: Dude-X: Huh? You can chain the element methods?

[18:37:59] adamgoucher: do you want to pay? or just free?
[18:38:10] barancev: why 'go test_ie log=true' puts log messages to the console?
[18:39:20] aimbire: Dude-X: Why not host on your host?
[18:39:38] aimbire: I meant, blog. Like 'Why not blog on your host?'
[18:41:30] Dude-X: i don't have anything at the moment
[18:41:58] Dude-X: adamgoucher: preferably free, but if i won't mind paying a small fee if it means ease of use and enhanced functionality
[18:42:23] Dude-X: i don't have a webhost. My ISP offers some stuff for me, but i don't plan living where I live for long
[18:42:34] adamgoucher: could just look at wordpress.com then .. and if you want to later run your own you can export it to your own stuff

[18:47:03] aimbire: Providing you keep yourself loggin in frequently. Well i have no complains on wordpress whatsoever, although i dont know their hosts i just use the tool.
[18:47:33] aimbire: I think however they are very reliable, im looking forward to blog about selenium myself in native language.
[18:48:18] aimbire: Wordpress seems to fit the bill.
[18:48:53] Dude-X: ok cool
[18:49:06] Dude-X: aimbire: whats your native language, out of curiosity
[18:49:15] aimbire: Portuguese.
[18:49:24] aimbire: I live in Brazil :)
[18:49:32] Dude-X: ah nice
