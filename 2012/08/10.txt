[08:22:12] Binken_: Yes, I know that. That's why I write UIAutomation script
[08:22:33] Binken_: But Selenium never gives me the chance to deal with it
[08:23:43] barancev: it throws immediately on the operation that opens the download dialog? or on the next operation?
[08:24:33] barancev: I know you've seen this: http://ardesco.lazerycode.com/index.php/2012/07/how-to-download-files-with-selenium-and-why-you-shouldnt/
[08:25:01] Binken_: I have alread checked this article
[08:25:29] Binken_: I click the button. Then the system will generate a file to me for downloading
[08:25:58] barancev: so try the first advice from the article -- use HttpClient to download the file
[08:26:55] barancev: selenium's behaviour on download links is unpredictable, uninvestigated
[08:27:35] barancev: in other browsers (ff, chrome, opera) you can tune the browser to autosave files, in IE you can't
[08:27:59] Binken_: Can I ignore the unexpected Modal dialog
[08:28:19] Binken_: Just let me do the next operation
[08:30:53] barancev: can you catch the exception and in catch-block do UIAutomation magic?
[08:31:39] Binken_: I catch it. But the dialog closed by itself. So nothing done by UIAutomation

[10:17:00] Wisec`: I mean, i don't want to modify the original selenium ff extension
[10:17:44] Wisec`: I'd rather prefer to add a new extension that "extends" the selenium one 
[10:18:03] Wisec`: someone?

[10:29:02] Wisec`: Just saying, but don't you think that it would be cool if it's possible to add new methods without changing the components/driver_component.js ?
[10:31:07] Wisec`: ..or just add a chrome eval method to give full remote control of Firefox at chrome level.

[13:36:42] rgr: why? python is the best language to develop webdriver tests?
[13:36:49] andreastt: rgr: Use ffmpeg.

[13:37:38] *jarib nods
[13:38:42] AutomatedTester: rgr: not that python is better, just I find Java needs a lot of scaffolding to do basic things
[13:39:42] andreastt: rgr: Many of us use Java (-:
[13:39:49] rgr: hum
[13:40:05] rgr: but, how can I use ffmpeg inside java code?
[13:40:10] andreastt: WebDriver is language-agnostic so whatever you choose doesn't matter.

[18:04:10] AutomatedTester: jimevans: it can attach to an open browser
[18:05:00] jimevans: right, but one of the things that takes the firefox driver so long to launch firefox is all the profile manipulation it needs to do. i'm wondering if that will alleviate that issue.

[19:17:39] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the reason why we need to restart twice is because we need to make sure that all the addon is installed and the prefs the addon changes are correct
[19:17:58] AutomatedTester: in that sense we *shouldnt* need to double start
[19:18:24] jimevans: also, copying the anonymous profile into the temp directory is expensive.
[19:20:10] AutomatedTester: jimevans: we will still need to do that
[19:20:34] AutomatedTester: its the way that XUL based apps are designed

[20:20:45] llaskin: i just want to make sure that instances will actually get terminated after 30 min
[20:21:01] llaskin: basically i have a jenkins master, that after it runs out of build slots, i want it to pump up the volume with amazon EC2 instances
[20:21:12] AutomatedTester: cool
[20:21:37] llaskin: omg so awesome
[20:21:40] llaskin: it seems to work
[20:21:47] llaskin: so i have 10 slots on my main machine
[20:21:54] llaskin: each of the micros I put up, gets 3 slots
[20:22:06] llaskin: and at 5 cents an hour...costs me next to nothing
[20:22:15] llaskin: the number of tests run simultaneously is astounding:)
[20:27:21] llaskin: holy crap someone just opened the Dev List floodgates

[21:34:55] jimevans: yeah, i'm officially getting involved in our selenium infrastructure here at work now.
[21:35:31] jimevans: we're still trying to drag people kicking and screaming into the webdriver world.

[21:36:28] jimevans: yeah, the equivalent thereof.
[21:36:33] AutomatedTester: sweet
[21:36:59] jimevans: we were always planning to move me into that role, but needed some time to get that moving.
[21:38:43] AutomatedTester: jimevans: its where you should be
[21:38:52] *AutomatedTester is glad that its working out
[21:38:59] *jimevans is too.
[21:42:20] AutomatedTester: yay... marionette docs updated
[21:44:40] jimevans: right. almost time for me to go. open house at the kids school today. (school starts tuesday)

[21:45:04] Dude-X: but it's august?
[21:45:40] jimevans: they're starting school a week early because their school is in the security perimeter for the RNC, and will be closed that week.
[21:45:55] Dude-X: ok that makes sense
[21:46:04] AutomatedTester: RNC?
[21:46:06] Dude-X: i've heard about some schools making the school year longer

[22:43:30] jl1: hey, does anybody here use webdriver in conjunction with django? I can get python Firefox webdriver to run fine by itself, but when i try to invoke it from the django ./manage.py shell, it won't work. So a simple `from selenium import webdriver; webdriver.Firefox()` will work fine from the python REPL, but putting that in the django shell will cause it to hang for a while and then finally to raise "WebDriverException: Message: "Can't load the profile. "
[22:43:50] jl1: fwiw, this used to work fine a few months ago, probably wita different version of django/firefox
