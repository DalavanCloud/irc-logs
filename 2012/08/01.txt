[04:12:53] Dude-X_: julienphalip, try with native events enabled
[04:15:07] julienphalip: Dude-X_:  Oh! How do I do that? :)
[04:15:58] Dude-X_: what binding do you useu?
[04:16:00] Dude-X_: ah pytohn
[04:16:11] Dude-X_: python on linux and windows has native events enabled by default
[04:16:28] julienphalip: Oh I see
[04:16:39] Dude-X_: so if the action chains nove element does not work, then you'll have to use driver.execute_script() and activate it that way
[04:17:19] julienphalip: To execute the even via javascript, is that right?
[04:21:10] Dude-X_: yeah
[04:21:24] Dude-X_: that's what's web driver is doing anyway, more or less
[04:21:32] Dude-X_: but at least native events uses the OS to click on things

[16:34:08] jimevans: that css selector should work then. are you using selenium rc or selenium webdriver?
[16:34:18] curseg: web driver
[16:35:17] jimevans: then driver.findElements(By.cssSelector("*[type=submit]")); should work (WARNING! untested code! may not work correctly without modification! may not even compile!)
[16:35:19] curseg: i tried something like this $elements = $sc->findElement(By.cssSelectors("input"));
[16:35:25] curseg: webdriver told me to go punt
[16:36:46] jimevans: curseg: i have no idea whether the language bindings (php?) you're using works correctly, but that should work.
[16:36:55] curseg: ya php
[16:37:15] Swadq: jarib: do you have any ideas?
[16:37:17] curseg: my error on that very same call is Call to undefined function cssSelectors()
[16:37:35] jimevans: that's a language binding implementation then. the underlying driver supports it for certain.
[16:37:53] curseg: hmm, ill have to chat with the architecht then
[16:38:29] *jimevans knows absolutely nothing about PHP, and has zero desire to learn until absolutely forced to.
[16:38:58] curseg: lol, its the language my company uses, best to have the support of the company =D

[20:09:41] aimbire: Hey guys, good afternoon.
[20:09:56] aimbire: So, i was wondering one thing, we are about to hire a new tester to work here.
[20:10:09] aimbire: How would you guys advise i could test him in Selenium WebDriver (Java)?
[20:11:50] AutomatedTester: aimbire: is this in prep or have you got someone coming in?
[20:13:26] aimbire: AutomatedTester: someone coming in.
[20:13:29] ssims_ has joined #selenium
[20:13:40] AutomatedTester: aimbire: get them to write a test with selenium
[20:13:56] AutomatedTester: and get them to talk you through the process
[20:14:41] aimbire: The main issue here is where could i advise them to do that, since we have very heavy policies around our products and nothing can get out.
[20:14:55] aimbire: Is there some kind of webpage people use for examples or some sort?
[20:15:23] AutomatedTester: aimbire: pick a site any site them
[20:15:25] AutomatedTester: then even
[20:15:50] AutomatedTester: but if your site is specialised then the best thing to do is get them to write a test against it
[20:16:08] RossPatterson: Have them write a test for www.google.com.  One that actually works :-)
[20:16:19] AutomatedTester: but then again I dont understand stupid draconian NDAs
[20:16:30] AutomatedTester: they are pointless
[20:17:20] aimbire: AutomatedTester: Neither do i, but those are the rules from here, not sure higher managment would be willing to change them so i can hire someone good.
[20:17:51] AutomatedTester: aimbire change your company or change your company
[20:17:54] aimbire: RossPatterson: Sounds solid, but how could i make it challenging?
[20:18:12] aimbire: aimbire: Not happening soon :\
[20:19:02] Alphanumericone: Anybody have experience implementing Loadable Components?
[20:19:44] aimbire: Alphanumericone: what do you mean?
[20:20:10] Alphanumericone: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/LoadableComponent
[20:20:45] aimbire: Oh, im sorry, unfortunatly no.
[20:20:51] Alphanumericone: I'm able to implement that example in C#, but have some questions when it's applied to a larger site.
[20:21:08] aimbire: Not me, perhaps some of the others.
[20:23:25] RossPatterson: aimbire: www.google.com is much more challenging than it looks.  It hasn't been a simple HTML form for a long time.  It's an AJAX application now, with things like predictive searching, etc.  Make them do something like take the third result of a search without pressing either button :-)
[20:25:08] aimbire: RossPatterson: by pressing either button do you mean using the actual search button right? waiting for the predictive search to complete?
[20:25:13] aimbire: Seems a good test tbh.
[20:37:04] lukeis: not sure that's a great test... since a almost there solution is the example on sehq ;)
[20:38:18] lukeis: something to demonstrate PageObjects would be my goal 
[20:57:11] Dude-X: aimbire: have them write tests against a simple website, like a blog; see if they put good comments and write something sensible
[20:57:33] Dude-X: see if they think about the things being verified

[21:57:12] AutomatedTester: WebGL I believe is better in Firefox
[21:57:20] AutomatedTester: otherwise I believe we are on a par

[21:58:31] Dude-X: :O
[21:58:55] AutomatedTester: and then I poked the bee hive with a stick and they got very upset
[21:59:23] Dude-X: Hmm, I wonder if one of my company's projects (which is strictly for mobile safari and chrome) works with firefox….
