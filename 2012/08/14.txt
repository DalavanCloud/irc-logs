[09:30:53] andreastt: The existing driver is being used.
[09:31:43] andreastt: You pass it in as an argument to WebDriverWait, which makes sure it reaches apply().

[10:25:59] xeranas: NeptuNooo, after methods like .selectVisibleText or ect.

[15:12:13] andreastt: barancev: I have fixed about half of them.
[15:12:24] barancev: yaw!
[15:12:40] andreastt: But since OperaDriver is in another repo, it won't appear on the Selenium one until the next release.
[15:13:12] andreastt: I'm contemplating whether we could include OD as a Git submodule when we make the move.
[15:13:34] andreastt: It might conflict with simonstewarts world view though.
[15:13:56] barancev: can't we use pre-releae operdriver builds, like IEDriverServer?

[16:14:42] jimevans: the first two chapters are "Selenium IDE" and "Selenium IDE extensions and plugins". that to me says no.
[16:14:52] *Dude-X moves file to trash
[16:15:18] davehunt: most Selenium books start with Selenium IDE
[16:15:35] Dude-X: i wonder if AT's book does that
[16:15:41] davehunt: It does
[16:15:59] davehunt: well, at least the copy I tech reviewed did
[16:16:03] davehunt: he may have changed it since

[16:28:48] RossPatterson: Actually, if the TOC is to be believed, that book is *only* about IDE.  I'm not gonna spend even US$4.99 to find out :-)
[16:30:33] Dude-X: to be fair the TOC says Chapter 1
[16:30:34] Dude-X: and tha'ts it
[16:38:06] Dude-X: oh it's 2 chapters at the moment and it's a work in progress
[16:38:09] Dude-X: bah
[16:43:09] jimevans: even so, if those two chapters don't include something like "we'll use Selenium IDE to get you going, but don't get too used to it, because we're going to abandon using it later on", then i can't recommend the book.
[16:43:45] davehunt: +1
[16:43:54] jimevans: and why, oh why, would you even bother including a chapter about plugins for IDE if you intended on abandoning it in later chapters?
[16:45:10] jimevans: though admittedly, i don't use IDE, so there may actually be a use for that.
[16:46:17] barancev: honestly, I'm writing a book too, in Russian, and it does not contain a single word about IDE
[16:48:25] barancev: these chapters usually has no strong relations with other content. "there is an IDE, you can use it to record user actions. and now let's forget about it and talk about Selenium"
[16:49:02] barancev: I'd write a separate book about IDE, if it's worth

[18:35:09] santiycr: oh, I should rephrase, I meant: latest on win7 and linux, 2.18.0 on XP
[18:35:24] santiycr: seems  like there's a bug that makes latest fail to start opera on XP

[20:48:20] sporkf: is there a way to wait on the whole page to load?
[20:49:10] stephend: sporkf: https://blog.mozilla.org/webqa/2012/07/12/how-to-webdriverwait/ might help a bit, in general
[20:49:11] Dude-X: wait on the last dom element is one way
[20:49:39] stephend: or that
[20:52:29] Dude-X: one thing i find difficult is to come up with a wait for page to load with loading data, and wait for page with expected empty data
[20:56:36] barancev: a page with expected empty data? what's the purpose of such a page? :)
[20:57:46] Dude-X: barancev: example, in the interface i'm talking about, it has the standard buttons and stuff, but you can search for things. if the search turns out empty, I can't wait for that data to load
[20:58:07] Dude-X: because there is no elements that will be rendered 
[20:58:17] Dude-X: but the rest of the interface is still there
[20:58:30] Dude-X: i don't mean a blank page.
[20:58:53] sporkf: jQuery.active returns the number of connections to the server.
[20:59:01] sporkf: so pass as your script to wait_for 'return jQuery.active == 0;'  ??
[20:59:12] Dude-X: that sometimes works
[20:59:14] Dude-X: but not always
[20:59:29] sporkf: when wont it work.
[20:59:30] barancev: I see. but there should be a sign (for a user) that search process finished

[21:00:15] barancev: otherwise -- how long should I wait to understand that it's not going to give me any data? :)
[21:00:17] Dude-X: sporkf: you stop receiving ajax server responses, but then your javascript library starts doing intensive DOM remodeling
[21:00:35] Dude-X: barancev: i want a generic function 
[21:00:44] Dude-X: actually in the particular case i am talking about
[21:00:55] Dude-X: there is a consistent dom element updated
[21:01:03] Dude-X: but its an attribute change
[21:01:33] barancev: and you can wait for the attribute value to be equal to a given value
[21:02:15] barancev: well defined criterion
[21:03:29] barancev: robots don't understand generic instructions. yet.
[21:04:02] Dude-X: i never tried waiting on a attribute change before but according to the fine folks at mozilla qa it doesn't work well
[21:04:21] julienresaas has joined #selenium
[21:04:24] barancev: why?
[21:05:04] Dude-X: flaky tests
[21:05:08] Dude-X: why else?
[21:06:15] barancev: no more flacky than waiting e.g. for element visibility (that's also an attribute, in essense)
[21:09:01] Dude-X: you mean like .class?
[21:09:26] Dude-X: well i'll try it later
