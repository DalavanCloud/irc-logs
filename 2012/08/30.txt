[14:22:57] schminitz: hello
[14:23:59] schminitz: i am using selenium with robotframework, and just updated robotframework-seleniumlibrary to robotframework-selenium2library
[14:24:15] schminitz: but now tests are much slower
[14:24:18] schminitz: any idea why?
[14:25:56] simonstewart: depends on how they're using selenium2
[14:26:06] simonstewart: If they're using the webdriver-backed selenium, then things _will_ run more slowly
[14:26:15] simonstewart: As the emulation imposes a lot of overhead
[14:26:47] simonstewart: If they're using straight WebDriver, then it may be that your getting caught on webdriver's more conservative approach to indicating that a page has finished loading
[14:28:24] schminitz: actually just selecting in select tags is really slow
[14:28:54] simonstewart: Look at the robot implementation. If they're not using the Select helper class, things will most likely be slow
[14:29:04] simonstewart: That helper class has a lot of stuff to make it faster
[14:29:22] schminitz: ok will try to check it

[16:30:10] dawagner: lukeis: I am! Though I've been dealing with some horrible disasters at work these last few days :)
[16:30:42] stephend: we broke the ability to download firefox in both IE and other languages
[16:30:51] stephend: can't get much worse than that, at Mozilla :-(
[16:31:04] stephend: so I feel your pain
[16:33:01] lukeis: dawagner: so the only other thing i wanted to talk about was moving sehq... i looked into heroku, but all it is, is a wrapper to 'easily' deploy stuff to amazon ec2... (so, i can't get it for free). Couple options... we use your amazon instance (that is if you're not actually paying for it yourself) or maybe someone on your team looks into a 'free' account on google app engine and I could make sure sehq could run on that.
[16:36:37] lukeis: in case you didn't know... our bamboo / xserve is really going to shit... and it can't build/deploy sehq anymore automatically
[16:39:33] dawagner: stephend: Ouch!
[16:39:40] stephend: yeah
[16:39:48] stephend: one of those things you want to fix really, really quickly
[16:39:54] stephend: and not have high-ups know about
[16:40:21] stephend: we missed an IE-specific JS include in a minified bundle
[16:40:45] dawagner: lukeis: Sounds fun! A few things: 1) We're not actually on EC2, we're on Google Compute Engine, and currently on a private internal cluster (I'd like to move us somewhere where you, jarib et al could actually ssh in, but need to talk to someone about actually doing so)
[16:41:11] dawagner: Alternatively, we can certainly set up an appengine, but I'm not sure how compatible SeHQ is with appengine, because I don't know anything about how it works... How does it work? :)
[16:42:47] *lukeis needs to research that a bit... i have a co-worker using it... i'm confident i can port it to work :-D
[16:43:34] dawagner: I know a bit of appengine (I'm actually working on an appengine app in my free time, and I've put together a few trivially small ones in the past)
[16:43:38] dawagner: But how does sehq work?
[16:43:43] dawagner: Or is that the bit you need to research?
[16:43:51] lukeis: oh... it's just a java war :)
[16:44:01] dawagner: Oh, easy :)
[16:44:06] lukeis: i need to get more of an understanding of how appengine works ;)
[16:44:29] lukeis: but uses maven to build it... of course jenkins can / should do that for us
[16:44:29] dawagner: IIRC for java you just create the war structure, and press upload
[16:44:52] lukeis: sounds good :)
[16:46:02] lukeis: and there's even a maven plugin to deploy to app engine ;)
[16:46:14] dawagner: Interesting.  Someone has already taken seleniumhq.appengine.com

[17:18:29] Vercingetorix: how do you run RC on a linux box to use the IE driver?
[17:18:39] Vercingetorix: (can you?)
[17:18:43] jimevans: you don't
[17:18:45] lukeis: you create a windows vm on that linux box ;)
[17:19:17] Vercingetorix: so it almost makes sense that if I want to test a bunch of browsers, maybe Im better off  doing it in a windows vm?
[17:19:25] davehunt: andreastt: yt?
[17:19:37] jimevans: the main problem is in the quit()/close()-with-only-one-window-open semantics.
[17:19:46] jimevans: s/the main/my current/
[17:20:25] lukeis: Vercingetorix: you're better off having LOTS of vms... and throw in some windows ones if you want IE.... also your original statement doesn't really compute RC + driver
[17:20:59] jimevans: once you call quit(), the IE driver terminates the session. period. do not pass go, do not collect $200.
[17:21:49] jimevans: but, if there's an alert that gets popped up on window close, like, say, via a window.onbeforeunload event handler, the session's gone, and there's no way to handle the alert.
[17:22:33] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[17:22:34] jimevans: so i really don't know how to get around that particular issue.
[17:22:37] lukeis: that's a to be expected f*d up state of the machine imo... although we should try to kill it ;)

[17:23:31] jimevans: #4489
[17:23:32] selbot2: 03 open/new Unable to handle IE alert window which appears after driver.close() call - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4489 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Status-Untriaged]
[17:23:50] jimevans: apparently, it's actually a thing.
[17:24:44] lukeis: that's not a bug
[17:24:50] lukeis: closing the window ends the session
[17:25:03] lukeis: no other driver commands should be expected to work
[17:25:22] lukeis: if close doesn't kill the IE session / window / popup... that's the bug
[17:25:26] jimevans: but it kinda is, though. otherwise, we've got an edge case that webdriver can't handle.
[17:26:09] lukeis: if his steps included opening a second window, i might say that's a bug ;)
[17:26:39] jimevans: the bug isn't that the IE instance doesn't close (though that *is* a bug), the bug is in the API design in that if the site you're automating has such a dialog, and you try to close the browser, you're hosed.
[17:27:13] jimevans: of course, i suppose navigating to another site before calling close would be a solid workaround here.
[17:28:31] lukeis: again, close on the last window is the equivalent of quit.... so no further driver calls are valid... not a bug ;)
[17:28:59] lukeis: i would suggest that as his workaround ;)

[17:46:27] monad2 has joined #selenium
[17:46:44] jimevans: if you wait on an element being visible, and get a timeout exception, that's a pretty good indication that the element isn't visible.
[17:46:59] kennethkoontz: Visible to the user though.
[17:47:06] lukeis: kennethkoontz: expected condition visibilityOfElement? invisibilitiyOfElement?
