[14:06:56] Zack: Hello.  My company is looking to automate our RSS feed validation.  Would Selenium be able to handle this type of test?  Along the lines of what validator.w3.org does
[14:10:04] andreastt: I don't see why you need a browser for that.
[14:10:45] andreastt: You'd probably be better off with an XML/RSS validation library and curl.
[14:11:10] Zack: yea, this was just thrown up as an option in our meeting.  Just wanted to validate if this is a legit possibility. 
[14:11:32] Zack: thank you for the response
[14:11:46] AutomatedTester: it is possible but there might be better ways
[14:12:41] AutomatedTester: since you dont need to interact with the page you can gain huge speedups by not using a browser
[14:12:57] AutomatedTester: and just using a http library and xml
[14:14:18] andreastt: Browsers typically use their own graphical representations of RSS feeds.
[14:14:21] andreastt: At least Opera does.
[14:14:32] andreastt: That's not really what you're interested in.
[14:14:46] Zack: Thanks.  That seems to be the best answer.  We considered scripting it ourselves, selenium and nagios.  Looks like I can cross off Selenium lol
[14:14:49] andreastt: So even if you were to do driver.getPageSource() on that, you'd not get the actual XML.

[15:07:11] jarib: it's still going, but i have the raw data
[15:07:59] AutomatedTester: andreastt: really?
[15:08:20] AutomatedTester: the what language you would like to use would hint at what tasks you want to do
[15:08:26] barancev: do we have aleady support for FF15? is it safe to upgrade?
[15:08:38] jarib: looks like a majority is actually happy where they are
[15:09:22] AutomatedTester: barancev: let me double check
[15:09:28] jimevans: barancev: no, and no.
[15:09:41] AutomatedTester: building firefox and selenium at the same time should work right
[15:09:43] barancev: I mean native events for gecko-15
[15:09:50] andreastt: jarib: Maybe that's an indication they've gone for the right tool for the job.
[15:10:06] jimevans: barancev: i knew what you meant. my answer still stands.
[15:10:19] AutomatedTester: jimevans: is that for synthesized events too?
[15:10:32] andreastt: AutomatedTester: I like Python, but I wouldn't write a browser in it.
[15:10:35] jimevans: synthesized events, to my knowledge, aren't version dependent.
[15:10:41] barancev: synthesized should work, I hope
[15:11:23] andreastt: (Although I'm actually not of the opinion that having a completely deterministic language is a necessity for writing a browser.  /me ducks)
[15:11:25] AutomatedTester: andreastt: yea but if you wanted to write a browser because you like that idea you wouldnt be thinking python
[15:12:10] barancev: so, ff15 support is another thing to do before 2.26
[15:12:10] AutomatedTester: oh look, Google fucking updated their SSL cert again
[15:12:17] andreastt: AutomatedTester: SVN on Mac?
[15:12:20] AutomatedTester: yes
[15:12:27] andreastt: I think it's a bug in SVN.
[15:12:30] AutomatedTester: andreastt: they change the fingerprint every 2 weeks
[15:12:34] AutomatedTester: andreastt: so say google
[15:12:42] andreastt: Well, it works fine on GNU/Linux.
[15:12:50] AutomatedTester: andreastt: never had this issue with Mozilla's svn
[15:12:54] AutomatedTester: or a number of others
[15:13:03] andreastt: I'm not saying they're not doing odd things!
[15:13:04] AutomatedTester: but then again, they dont use wildcard certs
[15:13:24] AutomatedTester: wild card certs, whats the worst that could happen
[15:13:41] barancev: btw, google provides wrong instruction to access git repo on googlecode
[15:13:54] AutomatedTester: barancev: because they dont understand git
[15:13:56] barancev: Add the following to your .netrc. machine code.google.com login barancev@gmail.com password [generated googlecode.com password] 
[15:14:21] barancev: actually, login should be specified as barancev, not barancev@gmail.com
[15:14:42] andreastt: barancev: They secretly don't want their users to use git.
[15:14:43] andreastt: (-;
[15:15:12] barancev: yes, svn instruction is correct :)

[19:03:12] slex: i reproduced this issue and attached test to issue. could someone say eta for possible fix?
[19:03:41] jimevans: slex: since i'd be the one implementing the fix, i'm going to say, no, i have no eta.
[19:03:50] emil_temp_nick: jimevans: any browser
[19:04:03] jimevans: emil_temp_nick: what seems to be the problem?
[19:05:00] emil_temp_nick: i'm trying to use Actions method, but getting an error at playback " Cannot perform native interaction: Could not load native events component."
[19:05:38] jimevans: emil_temp_nick: my psychic debugging powers tell me you're getting that with firefox, and that most likely you've recently upgraded to firefox 15
[19:06:13] emil_temp_nick: no, i have ver 11
[19:07:03] barancev: 11 has no native events support in the latest selenium version
[19:07:03] slex: jimevans: okey, thanks for answer. then i'll implement workaround at grid level by ie killing when first session at node is started.
[19:07:14] jimevans: alright, then you have version 11. either way, the only versions of firefox for which native events are supported are 3.last, 10.esr, latest (14 at present), and immediately previous (13 at present).
[19:08:22] emil_temp_nick: so, I guess 14should be best choice ?
[19:08:51] emil_temp_nick: and i'm using webdriver 2.17.0.0
[19:09:23] barancev: emil_temp_nick update ff to 14 and selenium to 2.25
[19:09:27] jimevans: slex: if you're interested in fixing it correctly, you should investigate whether IELaunchURL() starts a new session. from my research, it indicated that it would always start a new session, and not merge session cookies, but experience seems to be showing otherwise.
[19:09:48] jimevans: emil_temp_nick: you should strive to remain up-to-date with the .NET bindings.

[19:16:25] sassda: the interesting part, is that it only happens when I am using a remote server, if the server is on my localhost, no pb
[19:17:41] slex: jimevans: yes, i'm interested. I already performed some investigation: when js window.open() is used no IELaunchURL() is used. just NewWindow3 is received and so on. but i have no understanding how existed ie affects it.

[19:42:00] jimevans: yeah. so i wanted to ask a couple of questions about the marionette json protocol.
[19:42:29] jimevans: mainly about why the structure is so vastly different from the json wire protocol.
[19:43:16] AutomatedTester: jimevans: its using the JavaScript remote debugger protocol
[19:43:19] jimevans: for instance: the name of the command is "type" in the current implementation rather than "name" as in other implementations.
[19:43:20] AutomatedTester: so we are governed by that
[19:43:38] jimevans: ah. i see.
[19:43:58] AutomatedTester: lemme have a look at the code
[19:43:59] jimevans: so we'll need a new implementation for other language bindings (if we don't want to use a translator proxy)

[19:48:05] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i appreciate the inside knowledge, but if we're stuck implementing a new protocol that's not interoperable with the existing implementations, that's what we'll have to do. no worries, i was just trying to make it easy, instead of more error-prone.
[19:48:33] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the person who wrote that code is AFK

[20:00:00] jimevans: so my point is that the serialization of command for marionette isn't just "the same as a JSON wire protocol command serialization with additional stuff added", it's a rather different schema altogether.
[20:00:25] jimevans: so i'm not seeing how that's "just swap out the transport code", but i'm sure i'm just being dense about it.
[20:00:54] AutomatedTester: jimevans: ok, swap is the wrong word
[20:01:22] AutomatedTester: make FIrefoxDriver use MarionetteConnection and the rest that use the HTTP protocol can use that
[20:01:33] AutomatedTester: side by side
[20:02:43] jimevans: i still think i'm going to have some challenges there, since the parameter names don't match up for many of the commands.
[20:03:33] jimevans: for example, the navigate to url command takes a parameter called "url" in the json wire protocol, but it's called "value" in the marionette protocol.
[20:03:35] AutomatedTester: jimevans: tell you what, write down all the pain points you are seeing and I will see what is fixable and then fix them
[20:04:00] dhpe: Hi. Is it possible configure an RC so that should it crash all the browser processes it may have created would get killed?
[20:04:03] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the last thing we want to do is make life difficult for people using Marionette
[20:04:18] panshul: Hello All.... 
[20:04:24] panshul: I have a peculiar problem
[20:04:47] jimevans: i just started looking at this a couple of hours ago, so i'm just getting started with it. this is first impressions, how-do-i-get-going stuff.
[20:04:58] dmachi has joined #selenium
[20:05:37] jimevans: but i'll try to collect my thoughts over the next couple of days and get that to you.
[20:05:52] panshul: I am using a proxy server emulator... before the selenium web driver... now I cannot access https sites on my friefox driver... i checked in the proxy server documents to find this: "If you're doing testing with Selenium, you'll want to make sure that the browser profile that gets set up by Selenium not only has the proxy configured, but also has the CA installed."
[20:06:10] panshul: can someone please help me how to doit?
[20:06:47] AutomatedTester: jimevans: thanks! if there are things that I can change I will get them changed and landed ASAP

[20:15:04] jarib: jimevans, AutomatedTester: yeah, seems like a missed collaboration opportunity since jleyba already did this (raw socket version of the wire protocol) for safari
[20:15:35] jarib: marionette strikes me as somewhat affected by NIH..
[20:16:11] AutomatedTester: jarib: how so?
[20:18:30] jarib: AutomatedTester: i can't see a good reason for most of the differences
[20:18:58] jarib: but it looks closer to webdriver now than when i last looked
[20:20:18] jarib: AutomatedTester: it could obviously be *a lot worse* NIH-wise :)
[20:21:24] *jarib is playing with windows azure, of all things
[20:22:43] jimevans: also, the documentation at https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/Marionette/JSON_Protocol hasn't completely kept up with the implementation. :)

[20:23:59] selbot2: Client | Mozilla Developer Network: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Marionette/Client
[20:25:07] jimevans: the way i see it, the source code is the ultimate source of truth for questions about how it actually works.
[20:27:07] *AutomatedTester just got told marionette for fennec was needed yesterday
[20:27:10] *jimevans is glad he can parse enough python to read the source. :)
[20:27:10] AutomatedTester: *sigh(
[20:27:53] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I might have this thing called "free time" soon
[20:28:02] lukeis: what's that?
[20:29:24] jimevans: i've heard of that. sounds like a great concept.
[20:33:17] AutomatedTester: I will probably port the Java code and feel all the problems

[20:39:33] jarib: some MS guy was showing off node on azure at the webrebels here in oslo in may
[20:39:45] jarib: he was using his mac for the presentation :P
[20:39:59] jimevans: it's a start, but it's not a top-down thing. it really is done on a case-by-case basis, and the GPM or VP has much of the say as to whether they'll be community-open or not.
[20:41:37] jimevans: the office group used to *love* the mac. they made bank on each unit of mac software sold
[20:43:28] jarib: yeah, probably not top-down, but seems like something's brewing that we haven't seen before

[20:46:27] boonkerz: like boot an iso provide an hosts file

[20:46:32] d0x: in between
[20:46:34] d0x: right?
[20:46:42] boonkerz: test and shutdown the iso
[20:47:07] jimevans: d0x: yep.
[20:47:19] boonkerz: is it posible ?

[21:07:50] panshul: it works but does not support SSL with Selenium anyone here might know how to fix it.
[21:08:21] d0x: panshul: u mean browsermob proxy?
[21:08:38] panshul: dox: yes
[21:08:52] AutomatedTester: d0x: it works well
[21:09:05] AutomatedTester: panshul: you need to do a manual step to get it working with ssl

[23:00:15] marktraceur: I've been trying to get a test suite up and running for an application of mine, but I'm having a problem. The app has a "confirm leave" popup that fires whenever a leave-page event fires.
[23:00:32] marktraceur: I'd like to be able to hit the confirm button, but haven't been able to find a way to do that yet
[23:00:53] marktraceur: ...maybe I didn't look hard enough
[23:02:10] lukeis: using webdriver? tried driver.switchTo().alert() ? (that's java)
[23:02:29] marktraceur: Hmm, I'm not totally sure I asked the right question anymore

[23:09:47] mreedell has joined #selenium
[23:15:19] emil_temp_nick has joined #selenium
[23:17:28] marktraceur: OK, the news is this
[23:17:35] marktraceur: It's not an alert
[23:17:48] marktraceur: It's an onbeforeunload event, which is apparently some built-in browser madness
[23:17:59] marktraceur: Or Sparta, if you prefer.
[23:18:33] marktraceur: My instinct is to handle the event specially, but I also don't see a mechanism for that, so here we are again.
[23:18:56] chrismcmahon: and just btw, manipulating the "confirm leave" quasi-alert is completely invisible to SeIDE ^^
[23:20:04] chrismcmahon: my best idea is to call an explicit close() on the browser and start over with a new path, but that seems inefficient
[23:21:39] marktraceur: Well, certainly inelegant
[23:21:54] lukeis: marktraceur: you could try to inject javascript that disables (or overrides) the onleave handler to make it not popup
[23:22:23] marktraceur: I would love to!
[23:22:26] marktraceur: How? :)
[23:22:44] marktraceur: (I'm also not totally certain I can, but I'll do what I can)
[23:23:20] lukeis: first are you using webdriver? or RC? or IDE?
[23:23:29] marktraceur: lukeis: WebDriver
[23:23:44] chrismcmahon: lukeis: fwiw, this is selenium-webdriver + watir-webdriver + page-object gem.  We should be able to do raw Se from the test code
[23:24:18] marktraceur: chrismcmahon is the mastermind, I'm just running around smacking my head into walls
[23:24:21] chrismcmahon: but this is new territory for me too
[23:24:35] lukeis: k... javascript executor... pass in something like "window.onbeforeunload = function(){}"
[23:24:42] marktraceur: Righto
[23:25:15] marktraceur: I'm sure that's obvious, but is there an example somewhere?
[23:25:15] *chrismcmahon googles 'javascript executor'  I thought se-webdriver didn't make that sort of thing easy
[23:25:36] algard`: webdriver makes that sort of thing a peice of cake :)
[23:25:52] jarib: chrismcmahon: it's    browser.execute_script "..."    in watir-webdriver
[23:26:02] chrismcmahon: thanks jarib
[23:26:12] chrismcmahon: marktraceur: ^^
[23:26:19] marktraceur: fwiw, does not appear to be present in http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver.html
[23:26:55] marktraceur: Aha
[23:27:01] jarib: marktraceur: you want to look at http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Driver.html and http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Element.html
[23:27:02] lukeis: (and always listen to jarib when it comes to anything ruby)
[23:27:15] marktraceur: Good advice
[23:27:18] marktraceur: Thanks, jarib 
[23:27:32] jarib: through those you have access to the full API
[23:27:50] marktraceur: chrismcmahon: All right, since you wrote this, how on earth do I access a WebDriver instance from the spec file? :)
[23:27:51] jarib: anyway, this particular call is also exposed in watir-webdriver directly, so no need for webdriver internals
[23:29:24] chrismcmahon: so from the spec file it would be a matter of "browser.execute_script "<injectable javascript here">; close the page; no onbeforeunload event occurs, yes?
[23:29:37] marktraceur: Muahahaha, OK
