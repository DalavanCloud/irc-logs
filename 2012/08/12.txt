[13:35:02] dvn: Is anyone running Selenium WebDriver  via ChromeDriver on OS X?
[13:35:23] dvn: I can run the FireFox driver fine.
[13:36:30] dvn: But when I attempt to run the ChromeDriver I get "Unable to obtain profile lock". This is the same error you get when you attempt to run chrome from the command line and there's already a window open.
[13:37:21] dvn: I can't decide if this is a Chrome or Selenium issue. But is anyone having the same difficulty?

[14:01:41] moo-_-: dvn: you might first want to check if it's a version incompatiblity (too nee chrome)
[14:01:51] moo-_-: I have had that kind of issue somewhere in the past many months ago

[14:11:08] dvn: moo-_-, thanks. Although I'm not sure how to downgrade Chrome as yet.
[14:12:20] moo-_-: dvn: generally you cannot download old chromes very easily
[14:12:27] moo-_-: you need to find old release and stop auto-upgrade mechanism
[14:12:35] moo-_-: dvn: if that's the actual cause of problems
[14:12:38] dvn: Cheers, I'll take a look.
