[12:37:52] andreastt: Is anyone using Jenkins with an OpenStack cloud here?
[12:40:27] naresh_: Hi .. .Can anybody please help me .. how to manage the sequence of the tests executed in Selenium ?
[12:40:49] andreastt: naresh_: Sequence of tests are not controlled by Selenium, but rather by your assertion framework.
[12:41:01] andreastt: If you're using JUnit you can't control the sequence of tests.
[12:41:31] naresh_: ok.. so whats the best method to do it.. ? or is there any workaround.. that we can use ?
[12:42:14] andreastt: Why do you need your tests to be run in sequence?  In my opinion it would be much better to write them in such a way that the order didn't matter.
[12:42:30] andreastt: You'd be surprised by how many bugs you'd find that wayâ€¦
[12:44:31] jimevans has joined #selenium
[12:44:44] naresh_: for e.g.. I need to have some tests which verify functionality to create users, rename users, delete users ..

[12:46:31] naresh_: I am very new to selenium.. hope I don't sound too idiotic..  :)
[12:46:56] naresh_: unfortunately, yes I am using JUnit

[12:48:04] cheezy has joined #selenium
[12:50:05] jimevans: barancev: yt?
[12:50:15] barancev: jimevans: yes, here
[12:50:19] andreastt: naresh_: This isn't strictly speaking a Selenium issue, but if you insist of test order execution you should either write a custom annotation for your tests which ensures the correct order, switch to TestNG or use a TestSuite wrapper around your classes.
[12:50:47] andreastt: naresh_: But I highly suspect you ought to refactor your test framework so that it doesn't matter which order they are run in.
[12:51:02] andreastt: naresh_: Elaborate use of setup/teardown methods, etc.
[12:51:29] jimevans: barancev: if you're going to update the prebuilt IEDriverServer.exe, can you update the version resources according to the versioning scheme?
[12:51:57] barancev: is it described in the wiki? or where to read it?
[12:52:43] jimevans: the versioning scheme is described in the changelog. not the best place, i know, but that's where the versions are described.
[12:53:48] barancev: and what resource file to change?
[12:54:15] jimevans: there's only one resource file in the IEDriverServer project.
[12:54:19] barancev: ok
[12:54:38] jimevans: don't worry about it for now.
[12:54:40] barancev: I thought we should assign a new version number when we release a new driver version
[12:54:47] RossPatterson has joined #selenium
[12:55:05] jimevans: there are several times we release a new driver.
[12:55:11] jimevans: we release when selenium releases.
[12:55:28] barancev: do you want to update the downloadable file after each change? or should we accumulate changes?
[12:55:44] jimevans: we also release point-releases (updating the downloads page) when functionality demands.
[12:55:49] barancev: oh, sorry, missed your last comment
[12:56:41] jimevans: but the prebuilts are also directly downloadable from trunk via http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cpp/prebuilts
[12:57:02] jimevans: so the scheme is that major.minor version is synced to selenium releases.
[12:57:57] jimevans: downloadable releases update the "revision" field (major.minor.revision) 
[12:58:09] barancev: ok. btw, my last fix is not complete, in the same level of incompleteness as all alert autohandling feature
[12:58:37] jimevans: updates to the prebuilts gets a bump to the "build" field (major.minor.revision.build).
[12:58:38] benadderson has joined #selenium
[12:59:28] jimevans: describe what you mean by "incompleteness". is it incomplete in just IE, or in other browsers too?
[12:59:43] jimevans: and what's the spec on how it should behave?
[12:59:54] *jimevans hates auto-handling of alerts
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Aug  7 13:00:15 2012]
[13:00:15] barancev: in IE -- it does not implement unexpectedAlertBehaviour capability
[13:00:59] jimevans: i really don't think that auto handling of alerts was well thought out.
[13:01:02] eanxgeek has joined #selenium
[13:01:57] jimevans: are we expected to handle any system-level alert that a browser might throw, or only the types that the API will handle otherwise?
[13:03:08] jimevans: in other words, are we expected to autohandle file dialogs, javascript error dialogs, or anything other than alert() confirm() or prompt() dialogs?
[13:04:58] barancev: as far as I understand, we should auto-accept/dismiss the same dialogs as switchTo().alert() can accept/dismiss
[13:05:39] barancev: FF can deal with the dialogs created with alert(), confirm() or prompt() only
[13:06:09] barancev: IE can handle more types of dialods using the same API methods
[13:06:25] barancev: I don't know if it is good or bad
[13:09:26] jimevans: it's actually bad, but there's no way at all distinguish between those dialogs in windows.

[14:33:57] adamgoucher has joined #selenium
[14:35:35] rpereira has joined #selenium
[14:38:10] xeranas: farlan, if "print dialog" behavior is configurable browser-level, you can create separate firefox profile with these settings
[14:38:38] xeranas: and set this profile when you create firefox webdriver instance
[14:48:16] farlan: thanks xeranas, I'll move my question to FF developers, I cant seem to find a way to dismiss or disable the dialog
[14:51:30] xeranas: farlan, while waiting answers you could take a look in about:config (use it as address), it have lots of configurations hidden from regular users
[14:52:21] emmasoderberg has joined #selenium
[14:52:37] xeranas: I found one "print.extend_native_print_dialog;true" not sure that this one which you talk about
[14:52:53] farlan: yes I have been researching this for a little while, the closest I've come to actually disabling this is to bypass the dialog (which still prints, although silently) by setting print.always_print_silentÂ 
[14:53:44] farlan: I want to try to prevent printing and prevent the dialog from popping up
[14:54:15] farlan: I tried modifying user policies, but unfortunately any call to the print the document will pop up a warning, which is also undesired
[14:56:33] nirvdrum has joined #selenium

[16:17:17] Zelo: whats the equivalent of selenese clickandwait in python bindings?
[16:17:48] AutomatedTester: Zelo: :apidocs

[16:19:11] Dude-X: Zelo: you'll have to make your own wating mechanisms because some elements may require different waits; but the basics are implicit waits, WebDriverWait class where you give it a function 
[16:19:29] Dude-X: a generic wait function should wait until an element is_displayed() and then click on it
[16:19:58] Zelo: Dude-X so how can i check if after url click page was loaded?
[16:20:24] Dude-X: using a tool like the inspector or firebug with firediff, wait for the last element to be displayed or something
[16:21:04] Dude-X: keep your click methods simple
[16:21:13] Dude-X: but have separate wait methods
[16:21:49] Dude-X: so your tests look like this dashboardPage.clickNewMessage(); messagePage.waitForMessagePageToLoad()
[16:23:06] Dude-X: in your wait, you will determine that some widget at the end is the last thing to load, so you will have  a webdriver wait command that looks something like WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(lambda d: d.findElement(By.ID, '#footer').isDisplayed)
[16:23:38] Zelo: Dude-X thanks for your input
[16:23:53] beakerma_ has joined #selenium
[16:23:56] Dude-X: that's a general strategy
[16:24:29] Dude-X: if you have a super Ajaxy or JS widgety site, it might be better to use execute_script and do something clever
[16:24:44] Zelo: so in general bindings are more low level than what selenium ide allows
[16:24:46] Dude-X: for my project it's uncommon to execute javascript
[16:24:49] Dude-X: yes
[16:24:58] Dude-X: but when done well, it's far more reliable
[16:25:07] Zelo: my app backends consist of only javascript and ajax
[16:25:13] Dude-X: the real battle is figuring out what to wait for
[16:25:17] Dude-X: after a click
[16:25:25] Dude-X: then you can do the next click, or .text
[16:26:36] Zelo: Dude-X do you have any tests writeten in python and could share it? i would be happy to take a look at some real life examples
[16:26:48] Dude-X: i don't have anything publically shared
[16:26:51] Dude-X: but mozilla does!
[16:27:31] Dude-X: i don't have the link handy
[16:27:45] Dude-X: and i should :/
[16:27:55] Dude-X: they even have examples for usiing selenium grid
[16:28:06] Dude-X: well not examples, actual code for their grid

[16:33:23] Dude-X: heh
[16:34:13] zac_sel: python is good for test writing, it's not as verbose as Java so you can keep focus
[16:34:57] Dude-X: my project is in java so i have to use the java bindings
[16:38:45] Dude-X: hey zac_sel ; in your last email it seems you misunderstood one of my questions
[16:39:58] Dude-X: well reading the email, it doesn't seem like it's a question

[16:41:12] zac_sel: hi mate yes feel free. I am in a skype chat for about 30 mins or so but I'll get to it
[16:41:44] Dude-X: zac_sel: is it a good idea to wait for an invisible element by testing for staleness until it stops "mutating"

[17:00:27] zac_sel: dude-X I would say not because to some extent you are assumign that it is invisible rather than being sure that it actually is
[17:02:25] Dude-X: zac_sel: in my wrapper to the webdriver api, i have wait for an element to become stale/invisibleâ€¦ sometimes things like spinners can come and go,; so i was thinking maybe i should make my "findElement" calls try for 1 whole second
[17:02:32] Dude-X: good idea? will that make the test too slow
[17:02:40] Dude-X: well not too slow but add unnecessary waiting
[17:04:23] zac_sel: what kind of wait are you using, explicit?
[17:04:28] zac_sel: WebDriverWait? 
[17:05:20] Dude-X: it's always a WebDriverWait
[17:05:59] zac_sel: it's hard to tell without knowing how you are identifying the element in before and after is is invisible. does the class change?
[17:06:54] Dude-X: we have a save_in_progress class that gets the attribute active when it's displayed
[17:07:19] Dude-X: but according to fire diff, it toggles 2-3 times

[17:24:42] Archdude: what's the best way to check the status of an element (whether visible/enabled or not) when they frequently can be either
[17:24:52] Dude-X: make a custom wait funciton called does_element_exist

[21:50:43] Dude-X: the grid server dispatches jobs, i don't think it queues them up
[21:51:12] aces1up: doesn't it queue somewhere if no nodes/workers available?
[21:51:37] aces1up: cause I have spun up more workers and then it dispatches the additional work to the new node when I do it manually.

[22:21:49] kallisti: so I think I've figured out how to handle autostartup for browsers
[22:22:07] kallisti: with the convenient side-effect that it's fairly easy to add non-standard browsers that aren't part of the library.
[22:24:34] Dude-X: one neat thing IE does is that if you highlight a link and press ctrl-c, it will copy the URL
[22:24:53] kallisti: woah. that's cool.
[22:25:05] kallisti: (except when I don't want it to do that)
[22:25:38] Dude-X: well if you highlight select something and press  ctrl-c, it it will copy the selection
[22:28:01] kallisti: so yeah three nice things that come out of this design:  a) you can explicitly declare that you want to automatically start/shutdown a webdriver session b) users can add non-standard browsers with differing autoconfigure/protocol behaviors c) the compiler warns you when you attempt to use autostartup with a browser that doesn't support it.
[22:28:38] Siph0n has joined #selenium
[22:29:52] kallisti: a major difference here is that the browser is not /the/ class that you instantiate. instead it's a thing that gets tacked onto another structure, within the desired capabilities.
[22:30:03] kallisti: in some sense it's very similar to inheritance though.
[22:30:29] Dude-X: kallisti: oh there's an update to the capabilities thingie
[22:30:37] Dude-X: there's also a required capabilitiies
[22:30:43] Dude-X: it's in the webdriver spec
[22:30:59] kallisti: it's inheritance in a way that the "base class" explicitly defines the behabior; it chooses what inheritance means.
[22:31:11] kallisti: s/behabior/behavior of/
[22:31:55] kallisti: Dude-X: thanks. I'll check it out.
[22:32:47] kallisti: oh my. quite a big change.
[22:33:44] Dude-X: the idea is that you can specify that a browser _must have_ these capabilities
[22:33:51] kallisti: right
[22:34:06] kallisti: I kind of thought that's what desired capabilities meant. :P
[22:34:13] kallisti: otherwise I don't know what good it would be.
[22:34:45] Dude-X: the spec defines it as desired but not required
[22:35:00] Dude-X: i would like have to have it...
[22:35:03] kallisti: well, right, but in what situations would that affect the behavior of the server?
[22:35:23] kallisti: "oh, well, I don't support this. too bad."   "oh, well, I do support, okay."
[22:35:31] kallisti: either way the choice was irrelevant.
[22:36:38] Dude-X: required - takeScreenshot, "I see that this driver doesn't support screenshots, sorry i can't run any tests for you"
[22:37:00] kallisti: yes, I understand the purpose of required capabilities
[22:37:05] kallisti: I'm discussing what the purpose of desired capabilities is.
[22:37:17] kallisti: as I currently see none.
[22:37:34] kallisti: except the important ones:  browser, platform, version
[22:37:41] Dude-X: ah
[22:38:14] kallisti: in any case, figuring out how to support this new design will be, uh, fun.
[22:41:02] kallisti: also
[22:41:09] kallisti: when a capability in the required capabilities is false
[22:41:15] kallisti: does that mean you /require/ that it's not supported?
[22:41:27] kallisti: I would assume so.
[22:42:05] Dude-X: i don't know, never read the spec :p
[22:42:09] Dude-X: well i  skimmed through it
[22:43:15] kallisti: this is what I get for deciding that capabilities should be statically defined.
[22:43:54] kallisti: (it's still a good idea, just a bit more tedious)
[22:49:21] kallisti: I guess the extra object parameter is to maintain backwards compatability.
[22:49:37] kallisti: as opposed to maintaining a single capabilities field with options like required, null, desired, etc
[22:51:37] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[22:52:58] *kallisti doesn't even want to think about what happens when you include the same field in both desired and required..
[22:54:27] kallisti: required = false.  desired = true
[22:54:32] kallisti: desired = true;  required = false
[22:54:45] kallisti: your program is now allowed to be bipolar.
[22:55:39] Dude-X: heh
[22:56:38] kallisti: how do the other APIs handle this?
[22:56:49] kallisti: do they use 2 seperate entitites?
[22:56:52] kallisti: or is it combined together?
[22:57:06] kallisti: ideally, you should specify required/desired capabilities in one structure.
[22:57:16] kallisti: because of the aforementioned inconsistencies that can arise.

[23:00:42] Dude-X: i'm not sure,  i think Java is the only one at the moment that is up to date for this new required business
[23:00:59] stepheneb has joined #selenium
[23:01:25] kallisti: I think the way I'll set it up will be that each capability field can have a required or desired modifier
[23:01:36] kallisti: defaultCaps { javascriptEnabled = Required True, platform = Required XP }
[23:02:22] kallisti: defaultCaps { javascriptEnabled = Required True, platform = Desired XP, browser = Required firefox, takesScreenshot = Unspecified }
[23:02:39] kallisti: (you'll rarely need "Unspecified", as that's the default)
[23:05:38] kallisti: bah, the assymetry between required/desired capabilities and actual capabilities annoys me
[23:06:05] kallisti: it makes no sense for actual capabilities to return things like required/desired fields, because they're the /actual/ fields.
[23:06:26] kallisti: at the same time, it would be rather hideous to have 2 different data structures crawling around.
[23:07:00] Dude-X: and the spec doesn't say much?
[23:07:09] Dude-X: maybe you should bring that up to simon and at
[23:07:22] kallisti: it's not really an issue with the spec.
[23:07:39] kallisti: it's an issue with making a static record work with the spec.
[23:07:39] Dude-X: but the way you organize / abstract the code in haskell
[23:07:59] kallisti: to some degree.
[23:08:11] kallisti: there's likely a nice fix I haven't thought of.
[23:08:18] kallisti: one approach would be to have desired capabilities as a static structure
[23:08:23] kallisti: and actual capabilities as just a hash map.
[23:08:32] kallisti: but, I don't relly like that.
[23:09:36] kallisti: another would be that when you retrieve actual capabilities, all the fields are now "required", as they represent the true capabilities that the session expects.
[23:10:47] kallisti: this would make the most sense in the event that you decide to re-use actual capabilities from one session as the capabilities of another. it now expects that the capabilities are exactly the same for both.
[23:11:14] kallisti: I may just go with that.
[23:13:35] kallisti: with some type hacks I could even make static guarantees.
[23:13:45] kallisti: but I think that unnecessarily muddles the types.
[23:14:08] sawdog: Is there a way to slow down a selenium-server.jar session?  I'm using just selniumese suite that I created in the IDE
[23:14:28] kallisti: it sounds like you're actually wanting to wait for something on the page to happen first, right?
[23:14:55] kallisti: i.e., you want some event to finish before you execute more commands
[23:15:44] kallisti: sawdog: you can set an implicit wait, which will specify a wait time before selenium triggers an "element not found" exception.   (I should add that I know nothing about Selenese)
[23:16:37] sawdog: if you run the tests in the IDE, there's a slider for 'fast' to 'slow' -- there's a similar control when running them on a RC -- I want to slow them down....
[23:17:31] kallisti: interesting. I wonder if that translates to implicit waiting internally, or if it just hardcodes sleeps inbetween each command.
[23:18:08] sawdog: fast is *really* fast
[23:18:59] sawdog: heh, and causes all my tests to fail....so i need to slow it down, but trying to automate this in Jenkins - and so with a RC server, I need to pass that into the server.jar I imagine....
[23:19:49] AutomatedTester: sawdog: the "slow down" approach in RC and WebDriver is to have better polling for elements
[23:21:09] sawdog: AutomatedTester: I'm not sure I understand that.  I understand how to wait if I'm writing the tests in python using webdriver....but don't understand how that translates to running the tests in selenese on the remote server....
[23:21:39] AutomatedTester: sawdog: you cant really slow it down
[23:22:10] sawdog: but I can in the IDE - so I have to a) run them manually in the IDE or convert to webdriver and put in waits manually?
[23:22:30] AutomatedTester: yes
[23:22:34] sawdog: bummer
[23:23:37] kallisti: AutomatedTester: how familiar are you with these required capabilities and how they actually work?
[23:23:53] AutomatedTester: kallisti: whats the question?
[23:24:27] sawdog: is it possible to 'fake' it by adding commands to wait in selenese or am I heading into a rat hole?
[23:24:30] kallisti: Mainly I'm curious as to what happens when you specify a false value in required capabilities. I'm also curious as to what happens in weird edge cases such as desired = false, required = true.

[23:25:02] AutomatedTester: kallisti: required always win
[23:25:07] kallisti: and, also, I'm wondering how the Java API currently does things. I guess I could just look that info up though.
[23:25:27] kallisti: in my mind, the best approach is to use a single structure, rather than the 2 parameters that are used in the protocol.
[23:25:29] AutomatedTester: sawdog: there is waitForX comamnds in selense
[23:26:05] sawdog: AutomatedTester: I'll try that; just playing - ultimately I'd planned on converting everything to webdriver anyhow
[23:26:05] kallisti: so all of the boolean capabilities can be one of:  desired True, desired False, Required True, Required False.
[23:27:13] AutomatedTester: kallisti: do what makes sense for your client binding
[23:27:25] kallisti: AutomatedTester: does it make sense to allow required/desired options for /all/ capabilities. including browser, version, and platform? Will it have meaning with those fields?
[23:27:44] AutomatedTester: kallisti: yes
[23:28:07] AutomatedTester: kallisti: currently if you ask for a browser we try do the best match we can
[23:28:21] AutomatedTester: if it goes through Selenium Server
[23:28:21] kallisti: right, so required isn't fully supported yet.
[23:28:28] kallisti: but will be.
[23:28:37] AutomatedTester: it will be
[23:28:57] kallisti: how about browser-specific capabilities?
[23:29:00] AutomatedTester: unless I missed it being landed 
[23:29:10] kallisti: same thing here?
[23:29:14] AutomatedTester: kallisti: yes
[23:29:57] kallisti: okay. I can live with that. It actually gives the capabilities more of a declarative feel.
[23:31:43] kallisti: actual capabilities is still a bit of a wart, because there is no required/desired/unspecified distinction there.
[23:31:52] kallisti: at the most there's just an actual/unspecified distinction.
[23:32:22] kallisti: and I'd prefer to use the same structure for both.
[23:35:19] kallisti: I think I've got everything sorted out though.
[23:35:43] andreastt: AutomatedTester: I am slightly here now.
[23:36:01] andreastt: But I was planning on going to bed.
[23:36:04] AutomatedTester: andreastt: just a quick question, Who is AndreasB from Opera
[23:36:20] andreastt: He's the manager of the developer relations team at Opera
[23:36:36] andreastt: Natively from Belgium, I believe.
[23:36:36] AutomatedTester: aha
[23:36:46] *AutomatedTester was in a conference call with him today
[23:36:56] AutomatedTester: for Testing The Web Forward
[23:37:17] andreastt: Really?
[23:37:52] AutomatedTester: yea
[23:38:11] *AutomatedTester was asked by my manager to join the call
[23:38:14] AutomatedTester: and said yes
[23:38:26] AutomatedTester: and expertly flogged the WebDriver spec
[23:38:28] AutomatedTester: :D
[23:38:37] *kallisti is excited for hs-webdriver 1.0
[23:38:45] kallisti: I'll be breaking out all the advanced type magic for that one. :P
[23:38:46] andreastt: Awesome.  Is that the conference by Adobe?
[23:40:10] kallisti: any idea what would be a good name for the type that represents both desired/required capabilities? basically there's just a distinction between desired/required vs. actual.  The obvious name for actual capabilities is ActualCapabilities, but I don't know what to call the other. Maybe just stick with DesiredCapabilities?
[23:40:30] AutomatedTester: andreastt: it was a conference call organised by Adobe but they dont want to have their name in lights
[23:40:36] AutomatedTester: which is refreshing
[23:40:43] andreastt: Along those lines, what's your take on Adobe Shadow?
[23:40:44] kallisti: "Capabilities" refers to either of the 2. similar to an inheritance hierarchy.
[23:40:46] llaskin has joined #selenium
[23:40:57] AutomatedTester: andreastt: havent used it so cant comment
[23:41:04] AutomatedTester: I hear it uses Scope though
[23:41:13] andreastt: Well, it's targeted at WebKit only last thing I heardâ€¦
[23:41:27] andreastt: So I would assume Mozilla would be in the same situation as use wrt to it.
[23:41:36] andreastt: to  be, even.
[23:41:50] andreastt: Also, us and not use.
[23:41:58] andreastt: I obviously can't type tonight.
[23:42:01] AutomatedTester: yea, i do get a "ZOMG WEBKITZ IS AWESOME AND IS THE WEB" from Adobe, especially their Asian offices
[23:42:54] AutomatedTester: andreastt: anyway, Test The Web Forward might be something to put on your radar 
[23:43:04] AutomatedTester: especially if I have my way and we all use WebDriver
[23:43:31] andreastt: kallisti: Java just makes the distinction between Capabilities, being an immutable object and DesiredCapabilities.  The server will just return a type, and doesn't subclass based on what it means.  It's assumed that users knows what the type means.
[23:43:32] AutomatedTester: there were Microsoft folks on the call which when I dropped the WebDriver bomb made my manager very happy
[23:43:55] andreastt: That is interesting, indeed.
[23:44:08] kallisti: yeah it looks like even the spec itself uses the term "desired" to refer to the required caps as well.
[23:44:16] kallisti: it links back to the desired capabilities definition.
[23:44:21] kallisti: so I'll just use that naming convention.
[23:44:30] AutomatedTester: my manager is 110% behind the spec, he has been there done that with other browser automation frameworks
[23:45:33] AutomatedTester: andreastt: but go have some sleep
[23:45:39] AutomatedTester: we can chat someother time :)
[23:45:50] kallisti: andreastt: the way I see mine working is that each field can be modified by a Desired, Required, Actual, and Unspecified constructor. all of these possibilities are allowed by Capabilities. DesiredCapabilities and ActualCapabilities simply limits which of those modifiers are allowed in the structure.
[23:46:07] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Nearly 1 am here, and I'm meant to craft some KVM images tomorrow.  Best sleep.
[23:46:35] kallisti: they're actually type synonyms for particular versions of Capabilities. Capabilities itself is parametric (something like a generic in Java)
[23:49:50] stockton_ has joined #selenium
[23:53:54] kallisti: andreastt: out of curiosity how do you handle the differing types of capability fields in Java?
[23:53:57] kallisti: cast to/from Object?
[23:54:10] kallisti: or are there getter/setters for each field?
[23:55:08] kallisti: looks like the latter.
[23:55:45] kallisti: public Map<String, ?> asMap()
[23:56:00] kallisti: risky risky.
