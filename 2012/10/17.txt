[09:08:57] andreastt: dekroning: Take a look at your testing framework's parallelism features.
[09:09:17] andreastt: dekroning: Are you using JUnit?
[09:18:48] zac_sel has joined #selenium
[09:32:29] dekroning: andreastt: i'm using Cucumber
[09:32:57] andreastt: Then I have no idea (-:
[09:33:09] dekroning: andreastt: ah right, I thought it was something in selenium standalone server, but now that you mention it... I understand indeed that the test framework should just give selenium server more tasks to do at the same time
[09:33:13] dekroning: thanks
[09:33:44] andreastt: Yes, it has nothing to do with the Selenium server.  That will just assign more browser sessions to your client as it asks for it.

[13:26:42] zunino: Hello
[13:27:29] zunino: My application began failing to deploy after I added the selenium dependency to its pom.xml.
[13:27:41] zunino:         <dependency>
[13:27:41] zunino:             <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
[13:27:41] zunino:             <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
[13:27:41] zunino:             <version>2.25.0</version>
[13:27:41] zunino:          </dependency>
[13:29:24] zunino: The error happened upon Mojarra's startup.
[13:30:03] amitev: why would you upload selenium within the application?
[13:30:11] cmcgraw has joined #selenium
[13:32:09] zunino: Indeed I ended up solving the problem by scoping the dependency to 'test'.
[13:33:16] zunino: However, since I'm new to much of this, I just wanted to understand what was actually going on.
[13:33:24] zunino: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: com.sun.faces.config.ConfigurationException: Unable to parse document 'jar:file:/C:/Java/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/modules/com/sun/jsf-impl/main/jsf-impl-2.1.7-jbossorg-2.jar!/META-INF/mojarra_ext.taglib.xml'
[13:33:30] girija has left #selenium
[13:33:57] zunino: Like, when I looked at that error message, it never occurred to me that there could be any relation to the Selenium dependency I had added.
[13:35:07] zunino: Especially since I had taken it straight from the source (http://seleniumhq.org/download/maven.html)

[19:24:13] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I, and many others, have asked for CLA access by Simon wont share it because of privacy
[19:24:27] AutomatedTester: jleyba: he also doesnt reply to emails asking to check it

[19:30:05] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: so is ours
[19:30:28] AutomatedTester: but checking that a person has signed it is impossible unless your name is Simon Stewart
[19:30:31] cgoldberg: i run my own projects cowboy style :)  but when you get to scale, it starts to really matter
[19:30:46] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: same
[19:31:42] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, sounds odd to want to be protective of contributions.  but i don't get into any legal aspects
[19:32:07] lukeis: the cla has personal information when you sign it... home address
[19:33:01] lukeis: and phone # (but yes, both of those are optional)
[19:33:14] barancev: can it be hidden from public?
[19:33:16] cgoldberg: lukeis, linux publishes contributor emails directly in the source codebase if im not mistaken :)
[19:33:28] lukeis: i'm not worried about emails :)
[19:33:39] cgoldberg: right... but i mean.. everyone is identified
[19:33:42] barancev: I mean, can we make only names available?
[19:33:44] rbalent has joined #selenium
[19:33:52] lukeis: barancev: i believe so... but currently there is only one person who has access to do so ;)
[19:33:55] cgoldberg: names or entity names is enough
[19:34:12] AutomatedTester: there is a point where you need to trust people
[19:34:26] AutomatedTester: e.g. people who have access and release the code
[19:34:48] AutomatedTester: meh, guess I am just grumpy today
[19:35:10] *lukeis is not so grumpy... but I agree that committers should have access too
[19:35:46] cgoldberg: lukeis, i think there should be a public contributor list... dont really care who has their contact info. 
[19:35:49] lukeis: and I don't even care about the info in there other than knowing if someone submitting a patch has signed it! :)
[19:36:19] Ardesco_H: I think i've signed it twice now
[19:36:21] Ardesco_H: :)
[19:36:35] barancev: google code shows emails of all issue commenters, so what?
[19:37:03] lukeis: there was a reset of the cla about a year ago.... so, yeah, I've signed it twice too ;)
[19:37:28] AutomatedTester: that reminds me...

[19:56:01] *AutomatedTester wonders how long it will take to build Firefox OS
[19:56:14] SamuraiJack has joined #selenium
[19:56:28] Ardesco_H: on a shiny retina? not long i hope
[19:56:39] AutomatedTester: Ardesco_H: Firefox builds in ~25 mins
[19:56:39] barancev: I can't be andriod maintaner because I always write this word wrong! I can't learn it! android, android, andriod
[19:56:57] AutomatedTester: used to take me 1 1/2 hrs +
[19:57:14] AutomatedTester: its more 2 hrs but never really timed it
[19:57:18] Ardesco_H: that's a hell of an increase
[19:57:25] Ardesco_H: sounds nice :)
[19:57:36] AutomatedTester: Selenium tests are a blur
[19:58:31] Ardesco_H: tell me about it, the current project i'm on takes about 8 mins to run the selenium tests on the air i'm using, and is done within 3 on the shiny new retina's some people have
[19:58:42] Ardesco_H: need to parallelise the test at some point

[20:01:26] AutomatedTester: silly question: what is the binders that Mitt was talking about?
[20:01:35] lukeis: of women ;)
[20:02:04] lukeis: talking about needing to staff his cabinet, and said I need more women, and they brought him binders of women
[20:02:40] Ardesco_H: bleh, just get the best for for the job regardless of gender/race/etc
[20:02:46] Ardesco_H: why os that concept so hard?
[20:02:48] Ardesco_H: *is
[20:03:16] lukeis: because initially the 'best for the job' on his team was only men ;) and it's a bit hard to believe there isn't a single woman qualified 
[20:03:41] lukeis: and/or the *best* for the job
[20:05:54] AutomatedTester: i just found out I wasnt using ccache for building firefox
[20:05:59] AutomatedTester: I will get faster builds
[20:06:01] AutomatedTester: yay
[20:06:07] Ardesco_H: heh
[20:07:07] lukeis: adamgoucher: ping

[20:33:28] deanclkclk: that context configuration file has profiles
[20:33:59] deanclkclk: but, I wanna use an active profile without using @ActiveProfile annotation in my class
[20:34:09] deanclkclk: I wanna externalize it to a .xml

[20:52:44] lil-murph: I'm on linux. Just setup selenium. chrome seems to be way slower than firefox at running these tests. is that normal?
[20:53:06] smccarthy: my chrome opens faster than firefox, but not sure about after its opened (for me)
[20:53:31] lil-murph: like, text input i can watch it type each letter, firefox jsut flys by
[20:54:00] lukeis: adamgoucher: have time today to go over my talk with me? ... unless you're watching baseball, then I'm ok ;)
[20:54:24] adamgoucher: lukeis: i've got time
[20:54:33] AutomatedTester: lil-murph: i dont think that is the norm but I could be wrong
[20:54:43] AutomatedTester: lukeis: when is it
[20:54:47] AutomatedTester: can I dial in :)
[20:54:58] lukeis: tonight at 6:30 pacific ;)
[20:55:07] AutomatedTester: right...
[20:55:10] AutomatedTester: maybe not
[20:55:21] lukeis: should be recorded though
[20:55:40] adamgoucher: i dunno if it will since it had to be moved
[20:55:47] bfife: hello, is there any easy way to override the bind port for tests run during build (./go) ?
[20:56:10] lukeis: adamgoucher: well... maybe not video, but adobe connect wise it should be
[20:56:32] lukeis: adamgoucher: i'm eating lunch right now, but let me know what time(s) work best for you
[20:56:53] AutomatedTester: bfife: I dont think so
[20:57:04] adamgoucher: lukeis: next 90 minutes or so. i think i said i'd go out for dinner with the wife

[21:00:07] bfife: we will be. right now it's baby steps
[21:00:29] bfife: looking to get a regression bed off the ground at some point for regression testing a smartclient-based gui
[21:00:53] bfife: just hacking in support for the 'scLocator' that the smartclient user-extensions add for RC so i can export to python nicely
[21:02:01] AutomatedTester: bfife: with the plan of dropping RC soon?
[21:02:26] bfife: we're just starting this project now, not even running RC
[21:03:06] bfife: it makes more sense to build on a platform that is being actively maintained, than something that is deprecated
[21:05:55] lukeis: bfife: if it's a javascript based locator, you should have to hack the selenium code base... you could just make a utility that uses execute_script and returns the webelement located
[21:06:52] lukeis: s/should/shouldn't/ !
[21:06:53] lukeis: ;)
[21:07:14] bfife: ;) they have enhancements for the IDE/RC that let you use their scLocator for clicks
[21:07:27] bfife: out of laziness i want to be able to export a python webdriver script for things i build with the IDE
[21:07:35] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[21:07:50] bfife: so i had to add the locators to the IDE export js (python2-wd.js)
[21:07:52] lukeis: ah, ok... then that's building an IDE exporter
[21:08:31] bfife: yep. separate issue from the port binding for build tests

[21:27:31] KaibutsuX: hmmm, thats some bs, apparently I can't use single quotes as part of the xpath expression
[21:27:44] adamgoucher: dont use " to wrap xpath, use '. and then use " in the locator itself
[21:28:19] KaibutsuX: is there a reason one way works over the other?
[21:28:37] adamgoucher: the spec says use "
[21:28:56] KaibutsuX: for quoting inside the xpath?
[21:29:00] adamgoucher: yup
[21:29:05] KaibutsuX: ahh, good to know
[21:29:15] KaibutsuX: thanks
[21:29:41] KaibutsuX: hmm, still not finding my element though
[21:29:48] adamgoucher: gets a bit more annoying when using ruby/perl/php where the use of ' or " means the string can/cannot do something
[21:30:07] KaibutsuX: is there a way to tell xpath to ignore whitespace characters?
[21:30:18] KaibutsuX: I think the html is like <span>\nTEXT</span>
[21:30:27] adamgoucher: use contains(text(), "your string")
[21:30:29] KaibutsuX: I'd rather not use the contains(text(), syntact

[21:54:08] Dude-X_: which is not unusual to me
[21:54:48] Dude-X_: i worked on a project that used Rake, pylons for the python web backend, coffescript/Sass for the frontend
[21:55:37] Dude-X_: so i thought that the web server was in python, with the testing done in capybara and rspec
