[02:08:35] ner0x: Question: collecting input and displaying errors.
[02:09:33] ner0x: What's a common naming convention. The input has to be name="group{key}". I'm wondering how to do the span so I can loop through and search.

[20:19:47] nyx114: is there a way to run several tests at the same time?
[20:34:06] Dude-X_: depends on your test framework
[20:34:46] amitev has joined #selenium
[20:35:07] Dude-X_: if you're not using one, you can just do the naive thing and spawn multiple processes

[21:18:26] detronizator: Hi guys. Anyone of the Java ChromeDriver bindings in tonight?
[21:20:27] alexglow has joined #selenium
[21:24:46] nyx114: Dude-X_: oh
[21:24:59] nyx114: will that affect performance severly?
[21:25:03] nyx114: severely*
[21:25:52] Dude-X_: nyx114, there's a limit to how many tests you can run in parallel if it's opening several browsers on one machine
[21:26:16] nyx114: what about within one browser
[21:26:19] nyx114: using tabs
[21:26:45] Dude-X_: web driver doesn't know how to open tabs
[21:27:03] nyx114: oh
[21:27:05] nyx114: =/
[21:27:16] nyx114: will it be implemented later?
[21:27:24] Dude-X_: though i personally never experimented with tabs
[21:27:37] Dude-X_: but that doesn't sound efficient in FF; for Chrome it's fine though
[21:27:37] nyx114: ok
[21:27:42] nyx114: yea
[21:27:46] nyx114: because multiple processes
[21:43:58] Dude-X_: you can open about 40 processes on a modern dual core machine with 8GB of ram
[21:53:00] milligan: I'm using FirefoxDriver .. now and then it works fine .. opens firefox, and performs my automation .. but quite often, it will die in the driver initialization process saying Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: c is null . How can that be +
