[09:16:05] jimholmes: @barancev - thanks for the URL, but I've got a solid handle on Waits
[09:16:23] jimholmes: what I'm trying to understand is why in this case the browser doesn't block on the page navigation
[09:16:46] barancev: it happens sometimes :)
[09:16:59] barancev: blocking is not guarrateed
[09:17:53] jimholmes: why? The script monitors the load complete event (or whatever) and should block until that flag is set
[09:21:17] sburjan has joined #selenium
[09:26:15] barancev: jimholmes: yes, it means that the browser reporter page status as "complete", and Selenium trust it

[12:18:51] andreastt: Others have apparently been told they are going, so I guess I'm not on the prioritized list (-:
[12:19:30] AutomatedTester: it would be a shame if one of the browser vendors at the forefront of this spec didn't come
[12:19:39] andreastt: Right, so /setup.py is missing the selenium.webdriver.common.html5 package.

[12:29:40] AutomatedTester: hehehe
[12:33:36] barancev: I've found interesting info: http://www.quora.com/Software-Testing/As-a-software-tester-which-one-should-I-choose-Selenium-or-Sahi-If-other-then-these-two-then-also-let-me-know/answer/Narayan-Raman?srid=hGSL&st=ns
[12:34:58] barancev: the most important part here is: "Sahi is adding support for Webdriver based events, so if and when Webdriver stabilizes, you can use your existing Sahi scripts but be using Webdriver underneath."
[12:35:44] barancev: watir, watin, sahi, who is the next brave? testcomplete or QTP? :)
[12:36:24] barancev: webdriver conquers the world :)
[12:37:04] andreastt: Good news, even though I fundamentally disagree with the notion that ‚Äútesters‚Äù should not be ‚Äúable‚Äù to code.
[12:37:28] barancev: sahi is codeable
[12:38:01] barancev: but lots of people like Selenium IDE for some strange reason :)
[12:38:17] barancev: and sahi recorder is better than selenium ide, imho
[12:38:37] davehunt has joined #selenium
[12:38:39] andreastt: It probably wouldn't be super-hard to do something Selenium IDE like for Chromium or Opera.
[12:38:55] andreastt: But I just don't think I should spend my time doing that.
[12:39:04] AutomatedTester: barancev: if we had a company doing work on Selenium like Sahi does then it would be better
[12:39:19] AutomatedTester: but we, as a project, aren't caring about SIDE enough to care
[12:39:33] barancev: sure :)
[12:40:17] barancev: saucelabs tries to create se-builder, but they move too slow
[12:40:38] barancev: because... let me guess! they don't need it!
[12:40:45] AutomatedTester: barancev: its not part of their core business
[12:40:50] barancev: it's not a part of their curren business
[12:40:59] barancev: yes, you're faster
[12:41:11] AutomatedTester: its part of their current business
[12:41:16] AutomatedTester: not part of their core business
[12:41:28] AutomatedTester: they want the big test beds that need to be fast
[12:41:43] AutomatedTester: barancev: I think once they have official dev evangelists that might change

[13:56:26] *AutomatedTester carries on fighting puppet
[13:56:57] andreastt: I was going to do some work on the OperaDriver bit there, as it's kind of suboptimal.  One of my ideas was to split out the JAR starting/stopping part into a separate Selenium::Server class.  Do you think that makes sense?
[13:59:19] andreastt: So I added a new file, test/selenium/test_generic.py with a method test_something(), but it's not being picked up when I do `./go test_py method=test_something` or `./go test_py method=test_generic`.  Do I need to list the file anywhere?
[13:59:36] AutomatedTester: andreastt: you mean split service.py?

[14:00:28] AutomatedTester: andreastt: test/selenium/webdriver/common
[14:00:31] AutomatedTester: put it in there
[14:00:37] andreastt: Also, the output from running test_py creates a python-ff-xxxxxx.xml file, is that expected?  My test doesn't involve any browsers.
[14:00:49] andreastt: Well, I'm not going to check this file in.  I just want to run it.
[14:01:11] andreastt: And I'm having a hard time figuring out how you've integrated the Python stuff with Crazy Fun.
[14:01:11] AutomatedTester: you dont need to commit the file but thats where tests are looked for
[14:01:22] andreastt: Right, but what about test_google.py?
[14:01:26] AutomatedTester: that isnt run
[14:01:31] andreastt: Ah.
[14:01:33] AutomatedTester: and thats for Se1
[14:02:19] AutomatedTester: andreastt: are you going to split service.py?
[14:02:42] andreastt: Yes, that was the plan.
[14:03:25] AutomatedTester: andreastt: um.. ok, its a very lightwieght file
[14:03:32] AutomatedTester: that starts the jar and then stops it
[14:04:16] andreastt: What if you just want to start the server and use a remote client to connect to it?
[14:04:48] AutomatedTester: what is your remote client
[14:05:16] AutomatedTester: are you wanting a way to start the jar that is agnostic to operadriver?
[14:05:24] AutomatedTester: to webdriver as a whole
[14:05:37] andreastt: Might be Selenium::WebDriver::Remote.
[14:05:45] andreastt: Or something else entirely.
[14:08:43] AutomatedTester: yea, I would put it in remote then
[14:08:54] AutomatedTester: or even support
[14:08:56] andreastt: It's not related to remote though.
[14:09:12] AutomatedTester: its starting the the jar only...
[14:09:40] andreastt: But I need to figure out how to make crazy fun run a test first, and we can discuss the technicalities later (-:

[14:15:48] AutomatedTester: oh look, crazy_fun expert arrived
[14:16:02] andreastt: To me it looks like it only picks up stuff from firefox/*_tests.py.
[14:16:23] AutomatedTester: andreastt: that means it would only pick up like 5 tests

[14:35:58] barancev: and it seems to be a sauce issue
[14:36:13] dawagner: You can set the timeout using the desired capabilities set in SauceDriver
[14:36:22] dawagner: The sauce docs say which ones to use

[15:47:33] jimevans: that only gives you the c runtime. it doesn't give you compiler tools.
[15:47:41] detronizator: I see
[15:47:46] detronizator: so VisualCrap it is
[15:48:54] detronizator: LOL - the download page has 5 version of VS2012, 4 version of VS2012 express, and many more for VS2010
[15:49:11] stephend has joined #selenium
[15:50:58] jimevans: detronizator: yep. the sheer number of skus is insane. but the "express" products are all single-language, so that kinda makes sense that there'd be several of those.
[15:51:49] jimevans: you still want my phantomjs exe?
[15:52:57] detronizator: of course
[15:52:58] detronizator: :)
[15:53:00] jimevans: (it's like 17MB, 8MB zipped, because i haven't run the space optimization for distribution)

[16:38:43] detronizator: jimevans: mmm, issues?
[16:39:13] girija has left #selenium
[16:39:53] detronizator: btw, part of those have been created but than not used
[16:40:03] detronizator: I found it easier to just rely on the "native events" of phantomjs
[16:40:47] jimevans: detronizator: seems you're wrapping bot.action.* for things like mouseMove, rightClick, doubleClick and so on. you should be wrapping webdriver.atoms.inputs.* i think.
[16:41:57] detronizator: very possible that I used the wrong atoms! 
[16:42:05] jimevans: detronizator: i see what you're doing with the phantomjs "native events", but things like moving a mouse to a raw offset doesn't seem to work.
[16:42:40] detronizator: yeah, I have realized that some of those commands are not working properly yet

[16:44:37] bsilwal has joined #selenium
[16:45:37] jarib has joined #selenium
[16:46:10] jimevans: the largest group of failures i have left in the .net tests are interactions stuff. fixing those commands would go a long way toward getting the project to 100%.
[16:46:36] jimevans: i don't know what the "right" way to proceed is; whether to use phantomjs "native events" or whether to attempt to use the atoms.
[16:47:00] nhirata has joined #selenium
[16:48:16] detronizator: I think phantomjs aims at covering all those scenarios natively: it's my strong interest to fix those on the phantom side
[16:48:23] detronizator: and I'd happily remove all the atoms for this stuff
[16:48:57] jimevans: then it sounds like the way forward is clear. let's fix the native phantomjs approaches. :)
[16:49:49] jimevans: detronizator: btw, do we have support for file upload elements (<input type="file">)?
[16:50:04] detronizator: yes: we can do that programmatically from phantomjs
[16:50:14] detronizator: I didn't look into the WireProtocol part of that though
[16:50:55] jimevans: it's not called out in the wire protocol. it's just part of send keys, so we need to special-case that in the web element command handler when the send keys command is processed.
[16:53:57] detronizator: jimevans: btw, I'd need an advice.
[16:54:03] jimevans: okay, shoot.
[16:54:26] detronizator: look at this: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am63grtxc7bDdGNqX1ZPX2VoZlE2ZHZhd09lNDkzbkE
[16:54:41] detronizator: do you think I could drop any other "not implemented yet" for GhostDriver 1.1?
[16:55:16] detronizator: I mean, what's missing looks not THAT urgent at this stage, if we are this close to cover the totality of the tests you guys run
[16:55:47] dmachi has joined #selenium
[16:55:53] detronizator: well, the "alert", "confirm" and "prompt" stuff sounds "urgent" to me. but not the rest.
[16:55:56] jimevans: i'd drop the ime commands and the html5 commands for 1.1.
[16:56:46] jimevans: put those in the same category as the touch commands.
[16:57:01] jimevans: just my opinion.
[16:57:19] jimevans: the IE driver doesn't support any of those commands, as a data point.
[16:58:05] dmachi has joined #selenium
[16:58:09] detronizator: what about "alert"? the IE driver doesn't support those neighter?
[16:58:22] detronizator: neither*?
[16:58:49] jimevans: no, the IE driver fully supports the alerts api.
[16:59:15] jimevans: that's the only one that would really hurt if it were missing in 1.0, imo.
[16:59:57] detronizator: jimevans: and that's the one that will require quite some work to be accomplished :(

[17:00:03] nhirata has joined #selenium
[17:00:11] jimevans: but it's complex enough that i could see postponing it in the interest of getting 1.0 done, and the code integrated into the main phantomjs build.
[17:00:40] dmachi has left #selenium
[17:00:42] jimevans: yeah, i've been spending some brain cycles thinking about how you'd implement it. i've drawn a blank so far.
[17:01:53] detronizator: Currently, I'd prefer much more to focus on hardening what's implemented, instead of adding code/bugs.
[17:02:57] jimevans: i think you're right on that. so punt on alerts for now. get the remaining tests running green, and then come back to it. 
[17:04:07] jimevans: incidentally, one reason i've been focusing on the .NET tests is that they're pretty similar to the java tests. there are a few extra tests in the java suite, but in the main, they're very similar.
[17:04:34] lucabox has joined #selenium
[17:04:50] detronizator: jimevans: btw, I have submitted an "initial" PhantomJSDriver class into the /test directory
[17:05:02] detronizator: it's what I'd like to iron out and push to selenium
[17:05:15] detronizator: it's all in 1 class: not much more than the RemoteWebDriver is needed actually...
[17:05:18] jimevans: i saw that. i'll take a look.
[17:05:30] detronizator: it's a 1 instance == 1 phantomjs process at the moment
[17:05:57] jimevans: if i were designing it, i'd probably create a service class that launches the phantomjs process, much like the IE driver does.
[17:06:19] detronizator: well, the binding does JUST that part. The rest is delegated to the super class

[17:39:31] Shivraj: hello everyone!
[17:39:57] Shivraj: need some help on handling chinese characters via webdriver..
[17:40:41] Dude-X: webdriver handles things as utf-8 
[17:40:53] Dude-X: but i guess your language binding might have issues
[17:41:02] Shivraj: oh..
[17:41:11] Shivraj: am new to the whole encoding thing..
[17:41:35] Shivraj: so I did a test using Notepad - saved a file with chinese character as UTF-*
[17:41:38] Shivraj: *
[17:41:39] Shivraj: 8
[17:42:01] Shivraj: and it retained the characters.. so I am guessing UTF-8 is what I need.. right?
[17:42:21] Dude-X: that would be best yes that your html pages use utf-8 encoding
[17:42:43] Shivraj: BTW, thanks for answering the question.. :)
[17:43:19] Shivraj: so.. am using Eclipse IDE and I see an option in the project that decides that encoding.. is that what you mean by language binding?
[17:43:43] Dude-X: language binding is Java webdriver interface, Python webdriver interface, etc
[17:43:50] Shivraj: oh..
[17:44:01] Shivraj: am using Java
[17:44:03] Dude-X: you said Eclipse so i  assume you're going to use java
[17:44:16] Shivraj: correct
[17:44:27] Dude-X: I haven't had issues reading or comparing non ascii utf-8 characters
[17:44:58] Shivraj: so if you could give me some search query or some article to refer that would be good..
[17:45:12] Dude-X: you don't need an article
[17:46:09] Dude-X: you shuold be able to write assertEquals("Ë™û", element.getText());
[17:46:56] Shivraj: I am trying to search..
[17:47:12] Dude-X: set eclipse to save your source file to utf-8
[17:47:16] Dude-X: and you should have no issues
[17:47:27] Shivraj: oh..
[17:47:33] Shivraj: lemme try that..
[17:47:34] Shivraj: thanks..
[17:48:06] Dude-X: another thing too, your webpage/server better explicitly annotate the page utf-8 so that the browser doesn't guess incorrectly
[17:48:08] dekroning has joined #selenium
[17:52:38] Shivraj: oh.. server is actually not under my control..
[17:53:09] Shivraj: deverlopers are adding support for chinese character.. and am tasked with finding out if I can use my existing tests to test the new support
[17:54:52] Dude-X: yes, make sure the files are saved as utf-8, and you should be ok
[17:55:05] Shivraj: k.. verified that..
[17:55:18] Shivraj: still an issue..
[17:55:20] Dude-X: hoepfully they will use utf-8 server side
[17:55:37] Shivraj: so I'll check again with dev team.. thanks for help..
[17:55:54] Dude-X: but if they don't, then that's no issue, you just have to compare strings and reencode what you get using java
[17:55:56] Shivraj: getting bit sleepy so will try afresh tomorrow AM..
[17:56:20] Shivraj: thanks again!
[17:56:27] aivaturi: AutomatedTester: yt?
[17:56:27] Dude-X: at worst you might have assertEquals("x", element.getText().encode('utf-8')
