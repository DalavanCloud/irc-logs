[10:17:59] andreastt: It works mostly fine locally (even if it's a prototype), and it's down to Xvfb issues on the CI.
[10:18:03] barancev: andreastt: sure. any ideas why selenium-atoms/test/event_firing_test fails in opera?
[10:18:13] andreastt: Nope.
[10:18:25] andreastt: But I don't really have time to look into it either, so I'm fine with adding an ignore rule for that.

[11:36:09] jimevans: barancev: i was just looking at that.
[11:36:53] barancev: there are two issues to investigate:
[11:37:06] barancev: 1) testChordControlCutAndPaste fails in FF on linux with native events, Ctrl-V does not work
[11:37:44] barancev: 2) FF on Windows, multiple failures due to timeouts
[11:38:08] barancev: oh, there is a 3rd one: 3) IE6 javascript tests
[11:38:23] jimevans: the IE6 javascript tests are a known issue
[11:38:57] barancev: jimevans: do you know why they fail?
[11:39:00] jimevans: sauce recently moved to windows 2003 instead of xp, which has a version of IE that crashes
[11:40:39] barancev: andreastt: my fix does not work too, and I broke Opera 12 :(

[13:07:41] barancev: afaik, there is no restart command for the grid
[13:09:48] skiphuffman: So I should just reboot the darn server?  That seems excessive.

[14:24:50] jimevans: bfife: almost always makes it much easier to reproduce the error, so yes.
[14:25:29] jimevans: barancev: for the firefox tests, do we instantiate an instance of FirefoxDriver, or RemoteWebDriver with capabilities specifying firefox?
[14:25:52] bfife: cool. im getting a weird 'element is not currently visible' when using a more recent build vs. 2.25 in firefox 16. just going to make sure it's an actual bug and try to scrape some html before filing a report
[14:26:03] bfife: works fine in 2.25
[14:27:12] barancev: jimevans: we use SauceDriver (that extends RemoteWebDriver) -- https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/testing/drivers/SauceDriver.java

[15:13:37] KaibutsuX: barancev, I'm leaning more towards the object I'm returning is a POS, but I was hoping for some debug direction :)
[15:14:27] KaibutsuX: while I'm here, is there any way to convert a DOM element into a webelement?
[15:15:51] jimevans: KaibutsuX: i don't see the use case for that, though executeScript() will return WebElements.
[15:16:34] jimevans: in other words, driver.execute_script("return document.getElementById('myElementId');") will return a webelement 
[15:18:09] KaibutsuX: jimevans: what about execute_script("return {'id':'mine', 'ele': document.getElementById('something')}"
[15:18:23] KaibutsuX: how would I access the ele of that returned obj as a webelement?
[15:19:23] KaibutsuX: in python assuming I assigned it to "myele", doing myele['ele'] gives me a 'dict' of just 'ELEMENT' = '{somelong id looking string}'
[15:22:00] jimevans: depends on how the language bindings your using (python or ruby, by the looks of it) treat objects returned from javascript calls. .net will properly detect that instance and convert the dictionary to a webelement instance.
[15:23:07] KaibutsuX: yeah python
[15:23:27] jimevans: the .net bindings recurse through the dictionary, converting the values to the appropriate type. i'm guessing python doesn't do that.
[15:23:35] KaibutsuX: it does not appear so
[15:23:53] KaibutsuX: so even if I did have the DOM element in a js object, I would have to go back to do another webdriver lookup
[15:24:59] farlan has joined #selenium
[15:25:39] jimevans: unless you were returning only that dom element (i.e., not wrapped inside another javascript object) to your webdriver code, yes.
[15:25:51] KaibutsuX: ahh, good point
[15:26:17] KaibutsuX: is there anything inherently wrong with returning webelements in that fashion instead of using the native find_element_by_ calls?
[15:26:34] KaibutsuX: it seems to be much faster if I am sure of what the js objects are
[15:26:49] jimevans: nothing wrong with it that i know of.
[15:27:03] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: nice tower case on the desktop
[15:27:07] AutomatedTester: very shiny
[15:27:34] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, thanks... it's the "collusus" case from Bitfenix
[15:27:41] cgoldberg: collosus
[15:28:20] KaibutsuX: ooh thats nice cgoldberg
[15:28:38] KaibutsuX: jimevans: thanks, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't doing some crazy thing and breaking webdriver
[15:28:44] jimevans: KaibutsuX: all of the drivers i know of keep an internal cache of elements they know about, and the "element" representation you get is simply an ID into that cache. if execute_script() would return a dom element, it adds it to the cache and assigns it a webdriver id before returning.
[15:29:34] KaibutsuX: ahh i see
[15:30:16] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, btw, was reading your blog post about marrionette from a while back.   is there going to be a new FF driver that uses that?  if so, when? :)
[15:30:34] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: that is going to be the new FirefoxDriver
[15:30:42] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: soon is the best answer I can give
[15:30:55] *AutomatedTester is currently working on it
[15:31:15] AutomatedTester: zac_sel is writing tests with it for Firefox OS and finding bugs
[15:31:52] KaibutsuX: AutomatedTester: I read that too, I was a little confused, I thought the point was to NOT have a firefox driver and connect directly to actual firefox?
[15:31:52] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, very cool.  is it going to be a standalone executable like ChromeDriver?  (I'm thinking how it will work in my test deploys)

[15:32:18] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: no, the client code will speak straight to the browser
[15:32:39] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, so it's implemented directly in the python bindings for example?
[15:32:45] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: yup
[15:32:51] cgoldberg: awesome
[15:32:56] AutomatedTester: http://github.com/mozilla/marionette_client
[15:33:19] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: its just simple socket communications
[15:33:30] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: we are removing the addon approach to FirefoxDriver
[15:33:45] AutomatedTester: at the moment the client code speaks to the addon which drives the browser
[15:33:46] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, gotcha.  if you need any help with code review or anything else, let me know
[15:34:25] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: thanks, will be wanting to beta test this on people's setups to see what bugs we have before we release
[15:34:39] KaibutsuX: ahh gotcha
[15:34:45] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, definitely let me know.. i can beta test it
[15:35:50] jimevans: AutomatedTester: we still using "value" everywhere, or have we changed the parameters to mimic the webdriver json protocol command parameters?

[15:37:14] AutomatedTester: jimevans: its a case "thats wrong but not broken" so will be done sometime
[15:37:30] jimevans: once the protocol changes make it into a nightly, i'll give a native c# driver a shot.
[15:37:38] AutomatedTester: awesome
[15:39:23] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, general question.... I use firefox_profiles to set some options in my browser.  can the same be achieved via "desired_capabilities" ?
[15:39:50] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: somethings yes
[15:40:03] AutomatedTester: its a "it depends" answer
[15:40:19] cgoldberg: i need to make my framework cross-browser compatible.. thinking I might be abkle to do it by switching from profiles to deisred_capabilities
[15:40:40] AutomatedTester: proxy stuff can be done via desired capabilities
[15:40:52] AutomatedTester: I know that but I dont know what else
[15:41:16] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester,  i'll investigate.. thanks
[15:41:38] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: have you compared the speed of marionette versus regular python bindings with native events on?
[15:42:02] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: no but marionette tests run at a blur on my machine
[15:42:20] AutomatedTester: marionette doesnt have native events yet
[15:42:31] AutomatedTester: but the structure is there for us to investigate
[15:42:41] Dude-X: is it still clicking via javascript calls?
[15:42:52] Dude-X: would be useful to have native interactions for things like css:hover
[15:43:00] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: that will be there
[15:43:07] AutomatedTester: but its not high priority atm
[15:43:26] Dude-X: stability over features :)

[17:00:20] flyinprogramer: open a normal copy of chromeâ€¦.   
[17:01:17] flyinprogramer: and obviously, running  /usr/bin/google-chrome  or /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome both open an incognito version from cli
[17:01:28] lukeis: have you tried using the ChromeOptions to pass the incognito flag?
[17:02:10] flyinprogramer: yes, that works fine, but it just seems ridiculous that it's clearly building the binary using   /opt/google/chrome/chromeâ€¦  unless someone knows if it's doing some other sort of check to figure things out
[17:02:34] flyinprogramer: and those checks are failing, which is why my hack is failing...

[19:03:29] Dude-X: adamgoucher: i see from your saunter example you do keep track of timing through collecting har files
[19:04:59] adamgoucher: only if people turn it on and are running through the browsermob proxy
[19:06:09] Dude-X: i'd rather get coarse grain timings by keeping track of function execution  (i usually write atomic webdriver commands)
[19:06:32] Dude-X: I guess i should use a decorator for that now that i think about it
[19:14:52] alexglow has joined #selenium
[19:27:17] admc has joined #selenium
[19:28:13] KaibutsuX: so I just found an awesome bug in webdriver if the page has mootools
[19:29:06] KaibutsuX: apparently execute_script("return obj;") will never return if the object has any members that are methods; as in "return {'name':'selenium', 'func':function(){}}"
[19:31:23] KaibutsuX: at least within our framework, I'm not exactly sure what we're doing with mootools, but I have more to look at
[19:32:13] cgoldberg: Dude-X, timing decorator vs. har file are very diff things
[19:33:03] cgoldberg: Dude-X .. consider webdriver get() ... that might issue 200 http requests from the initial page load... HAR file shows them all
[19:33:56] cgoldberg: Dude-X, i've got a neat python trick for timing if you wanna see?   I use context managers instead of decorators
[19:36:21] Dude-X: cgoldberg:  yes please. I just want coarse level timings, it's a metric to see if the application is degrading performance over time (or improving)
[19:37:19] cgoldberg: Dude-X ... check this post.  I find myself using similar code for timing pretty regularly:  http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.com/2012/06/python-timer-class-context-manager-for.html

[19:41:45] jimevans: AutomatedTester: s'up?
[19:42:18] Dude-X: cgoldberg: so seeing this, at first i thought about decorating page object functions, but may be I can use this context manager in my webdrvier api wrapper
[19:42:42] AutomatedTester: jimevans: what is you feeling for IsDisplayed of element A if a user clicks a widget B that expands the image to full screen
[19:43:02] AutomatedTester: jimevans: and element A is not in the tree that we walk to check IsDisplayed
[19:43:38] AutomatedTester: should we just go 'meh, one of those things' or should we check the for any element that could block all elements from being visible
[19:44:24] jimevans: i don't think isDisplayed makes a distinction between "overlapped by another visible thing" and "visible and on top", does it?
[19:44:32] AutomatedTester: no it doesnt
[19:44:52] jimevans: so, i'd say it's still displayed, even though it's overlapped by something else.
[19:46:18] AutomatedTester: jimevans: yea
[19:46:25] AutomatedTester: but...
[19:46:33] *AutomatedTester sees both sides of this
[19:47:08] jimevans: i can see the argument either way, but if you start taking overlaps into account, all of a sudden, isDisplayed has to become a whole lot smarter than it is today.
[19:47:41] AutomatedTester: well this is what I am trying to work out
[19:47:50] AutomatedTester: should we do the right thing or the easy thing
[19:47:58] AutomatedTester: easy thing imho is what has been implemented
[19:48:11] AutomatedTester: right thing, and super slow thing, is to see if there is overlaps

[20:09:30] KaibutsuX: barancev: broken in 2.25 as well, I'll file a report
[20:10:20] AutomatedTester: jleyba: someone in Mozilla has raised a bug about isDisplayed in Marionette, which uses atoms
[20:10:44] jleyba: Is it something I can see?
[20:10:52] AutomatedTester: sure
[20:11:02] AutomatedTester: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=801733#c0
[20:11:13] AutomatedTester: the last line of that comment
[20:11:31] *lukeis is going to test my assumption that i made earlier...
[20:11:41] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I can see where they are coming from and the atoms dont cater for that 
[20:13:04] AutomatedTester: the thing they click on takes over the entire screen and the element they are checking is not in the path the isDisplayed code checks
[20:14:43] jleyba: The atoms walk up the DOM from the element you test
[20:15:05] jleyba: I don't have the code at hand, but I don't think they test z-ordering
[20:15:17] AutomatedTester: jleyba: no they dont
[20:15:20] jleyba: So if you have an absolutely positioned DOM element covering another, the one in the back would still count as visible
[20:15:44] AutomatedTester: jleyba: that is correct, and that is the "bug" he is mentioning
[20:16:06] jleyba: Right now the work around would be to get some coordinates and do an element hit test
[20:16:08] jleyba: see what comes back
[20:16:33] jleyba: we could do that in the atom, but I'm not sure what set of coordinates would be correct (one of the corners?  the middle?)
[20:16:56] AutomatedTester: jleyba: yea, I can see that. The question I posed to jimevans, and now you, is should we try see if there an overlap
[20:17:29] AutomatedTester: the amount of work that is does would grow a lot and therefore make it slower
[20:17:59] lukeis: AutomatedTester: https://gist.github.com/3954900
[20:18:08] jleyba: I don't think we should do it
[20:18:30] jleyba: It would impact performance on every command and would be easy for us to get wrong
[20:18:53] AutomatedTester: jleyba: yea those were my concerns too
[20:18:59] Dude-X: also for people who test in small browser windows, it will be annoying too because somtimes elements overlap
[20:19:19] jleyba: Dude-X: very good point - CSS reflow would be a bitch to write a test against
[20:19:49] AutomatedTester: yea but a user wouldnt be able to click/use that element
[20:20:01] AutomatedTester: because its hidden
[20:20:10] lukeis: AutomatedTester: firefox currently clicks it
[20:20:26] jleyba: AutomatedTester: I think there are some teams here using image diffs to check these types of scenarios
[20:20:26] AutomatedTester: interesting
[20:20:45] jleyba: lukeis: Have you tried with native events?
[20:20:52] lukeis: i'm on a mac ;)
[20:21:03] jleyba: synthetic events will always click on the element you tell it... native events should do the correct hit tests
[20:21:06] lukeis: and I would assume not...

[20:26:05] bfife: i have a web element that i can see is visible on a page at 1280x1024, yet is_displayed() returns false. if i resize the webpage to be fullscreen, it is suddenly visible.
[20:26:28] Dude-X: is it at the edge of the viewport?
[20:27:12] bfife: no, it's at about 3/4 the width of the browser window from the left
[20:27:15] lukeis: jleyba: i'm currently unable to set native events in 2.25 with python :-/ (holy cow?!)
[20:27:33] lukeis: on windows...
[20:27:41] bfife: however, let me check..
[20:28:44] AutomatedTester: lukeis: how come?
[20:28:49] lukeis: i don't know....
[20:29:06] AutomatedTester: remote or tight binding?
[20:29:19] lukeis: same issue that we've been seeing which was tripping us up for 2.26
[20:29:22] bfife: Dude-X: no, its fine.
[20:29:23] lukeis: both
[20:29:29] AutomatedTester: interesting
[20:29:40] bfife: now the curious thing here is, it works fine in 2.25 and not in a more recent build...
[20:29:47] lukeis: printing driver.capabilties 
[20:29:54] lukeis: false :(
[20:29:59] AutomatedTester: hmmm
[20:30:38] bfife: i saved an offline copy of the page but it doesn't exhibit the same issue either, so a bug report isnt really helpful
[20:31:32] lukeis: i think we need to add a test that checks that the capabilities coming back actually say nativeEvents: true for all the native events tests...
[20:34:58] jimevans: lukeis, AutomatedTester: as another data point, the .net bindings returns true for native events on windows, both in the remote and browser-specific bindings case.
[20:35:13] lukeis: for 2.25?
[20:35:15] AutomatedTester: and java?
[20:35:19] lukeis: and which version of FF?
[20:35:22] jimevans: oh, for 2.25. sorry.

[20:38:51] jimevans: bfife: not sure if i can take anymore at the moment. :) 2.26 is causing me to remove what little hair is left on top of my head.
[20:39:05] jimevans: AutomatedTester: that's not what I said? :)
[20:40:46] bfife: well i'ma save it for next time you need a haircut then. as i go search through trunk for the problem
[20:41:21] jimevans: bfife: seriously, what are you running into?

[20:43:09] bfife: so when i try to click it, "element is not currently visible"
[20:43:17] bfife: ff 16.0.1

[21:37:49] Dude-X: load firebug into firefox, run the test, where i put a sleep of 2 million millseconds; then i poke around using firebug

[23:26:34] jarib: it's effectively ignored
[23:26:35] lukeis: ah, voila
[23:28:00] lukeis: bad in a wayâ€¦ since it's not getting highlighted in ignoresâ€¦ oh well, i know iOS needs them :)
[23:30:19] barancev: for the record, before I go to bed: I think that CI is stable enough and we can start to ship 2.26
