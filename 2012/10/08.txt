[07:13:55] Prasanth: Does selenium supports silverlight 5?
[07:14:04] Prasanth: please answer me ASAP..
[07:14:23] Prasanth: while recording with IDE it is not recording..
[07:15:05] barancev|2: Prasanth: silverlight is not supported
[07:15:33] Prasanth: oh there are no patches for silverlight ?
[07:15:37] girija has left #selenium
[07:15:50] Prasanth: in selenium
[07:15:58] barancev|2: Prasanth: it's not supported by design

[07:16:59] Prasanth: i don't know properly but there is somethign they mean it..
[07:17:08] Prasanth: i am not able to understand..
[07:17:08] barancev|2: yes, there is a third-party extension for Selenium RC -- http://code.google.com/p/silverlight-selenium/
[07:17:22] Prasanth: does that support?
[07:18:12] barancev|2: but 1) it's not a part of selenium, 2) it's developed and maintaned independently, so you'd better ask the maintaner of this extension on the status

[14:22:15] jimevans: i'd love to know why, but i can't seem to reproduce it outside of the context of the IE driver. the problem happens when executing certain (but not all!) of the automation atoms.

[14:38:00] jimevans: how do i natively set a file upload in phantomjs?
[14:38:59] detronizator: there should be an api on the page object
[14:39:18] detronizator: you "set" the file to upload
[14:39:20] selbot2_: 03andreastt@opera.com half a minute ago - AndreasTolfTolfsen: Effective platform might be Windows 2008, so we need to use the platform comparison heuristic as we fail on all types of Windowses | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=17925 | http://seleniumhq.org/ci.jsp?r=17925
[14:39:27] detronizator: than I think you click on the "file picker" widget
[14:39:39] detronizator: and the thing you choose before is used
[14:41:39] jimevans: found it. it's "uploadFile()", but it takes two args, the element selector and the file name, which doesn't really fit the model of ghostdriver. let me tinker with it.

[14:43:06] andreastt: That was me.
[14:43:10] andreastt: No need to worry.
[14:43:37] detronizator: jimevans: why that doesn't surprise me? :)
[14:43:44] andreastt: For the record, I think we should include "vista" as a possible search term for Platform.VISTA.
[14:44:03] detronizator: there are loads of things that PhantomJS has that don't really fit the WebDriver model
[14:44:13] detronizator: the challenge of this project is mostly that :)
[14:44:19] jimevans: indeed.
[14:44:23] andreastt: Because the matcher is kind of strange.  It matches against "vista", instead of Platform.values().
[14:44:42] detronizator: jimevans: anyway, working out issues with Python binding now. A small fix it unlocking the whole shananigans

[14:52:12] AutomatedTester: then there is no issue
[14:52:21] detronizator: AutomatedTester: -_-'
[14:52:22] AutomatedTester: *phew* that was easy
[14:52:37] detronizator: AutomatedTester: the "encoding" of the POST requests
[14:52:49] AutomatedTester: yea
[14:52:51] detronizator: made by the Python binding
[14:52:55] detronizator: has the Encoding set to
[14:53:07] detronizator: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
[14:53:08] detronizator: why?
[14:53:25] detronizator: shouldn't that be "application/json"?
[14:53:28] AutomatedTester: detronizator: because that is the default for urllib
[14:53:44] detronizator: AutomatedTester: sounds like excuses :P
[14:53:46] AutomatedTester: detronizator: only the phantomjs server is anal about this
[14:53:58] AutomatedTester: detronizator: its been fixed for 2.26
[14:54:03] detronizator: LOLz
[14:54:12] detronizator: am I fixing another "not an issue anymore"?
[14:54:41] AutomatedTester: detronizator: well, not being pedantic on the Content-Type isnt a bad thing
[14:55:10] detronizator: AutomatedTester: pedantic? I call that being precise and following specs... but sure, we are a pedantic bunch!!!
[14:55:24] detronizator: AutomatedTester: now, what's more interesting - how/what/who made you fix that?
[14:55:39] AutomatedTester: someone raised a bug about phantomjs crashing
[14:55:39] detronizator: AutomatedTester: And, to be even more pedantic, why no one told me!?!!? :P
[14:55:58] jimevans: there was a huge discussion here in the channel last week. :)
[14:56:14] jimevans: my bad. i should've told you :)
[14:56:33] detronizator: jimevans: AutomatedTester: you owe me a beer
[14:56:47] AutomatedTester: sorry, who owes who a beer?
[14:57:03] detronizator: AutomatedTester: You more than jimevans - you MAKE beers 
[14:57:20] AutomatedTester: detronizator: the root cause of the crash is still there
[14:57:21] detronizator: AutomatedTester: it's only polite to offer one to me that I wasted time fixing a non issue
[14:57:47] detronizator: AutomatedTester: that doesn't REALLY causes a crash - it causes a JSON.parse() error
[14:58:04] detronizator: but, anyway, a clean workaround is on it's way (almost ready to commit)
[14:58:25] detronizator: as soon as the Python-naughty-binding fixes that issue, the workaround will silently be disabled
[14:58:26] AutomatedTester: detronizator: the person last week was saying the server was crashing
[14:58:52] detronizator: AutomatedTester: lots of people that are playing around with GhostDriver have got no clue on how to report issues
[14:59:14] detronizator: if instead was jimevans, he just wanted to make you feel guilty
[14:59:16] detronizator: :)
[14:59:17] AutomatedTester: detronizator: iirc its the person who made the perl bindings that raised the issue
[14:59:34] AutomatedTester: so he probably knows what we mean by crash
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Oct  8 15:00:20 2012]
[15:00:20] detronizator: AutomatedTester: I'd love to see that reproduced - on my side that can't cause a crash (as long as we are still talking about the wrong Content-Type)
[15:00:45] detronizator: AutomatedTester: if it was crashing as in core-dump, it was something else/more
[15:01:07] AutomatedTester: detronizator: I didnt try reproduce it
[15:01:25] detronizator: AutomatedTester: OK, but it's great that is now using the right Content-Type
[15:01:29] jimevans: detronizator: aivaturi was reporting the python issue. he's a pretty sharp guy.
[15:01:55] detronizator: jimevans: yes, but he didn't talk about "crashes" - I have read is issue on GitHub
[15:02:28] AutomatedTester: detronizator: fwiw, no other webserver has complained about this issue on any of the browser implementions till ghostdriver
[15:03:13] AutomatedTester: if I write a binding in <insert lang here> and dont set Content-Type and it works for the rest I know where I would raise a bug against
[15:03:33] detronizator: AutomatedTester: if you spend some time looking at the webserver in PhantomJS, you will probably cry. I have "tried" to make it a bit better (that's why there is the "postRaw" that allows the workaround)
[15:04:14] detronizator: yes, AutomatedTester, I admit (again) that the webserver in PhantomJS sucks, no questions there
[15:04:23] detronizator: but you have to admit that there is a document with Specs
[15:04:34] AutomatedTester: detronizator: I never said it sucked
[15:04:37] detronizator: that talks about "application/json" being the content-type
[15:04:38] jimevans: somebody tried to get "cute" with the mongoose implementation in phantomjs. 
[15:04:40] detronizator: AutomatedTester: I say so!
[15:05:14] detronizator: jimevans: yep - I have spent a day trying to make it less terrible, but it needs a full rewrite
[15:05:24] AutomatedTester: detronizator: and people follow specs?
[15:05:35] jimevans: i'm not enough of a Qt/QtWebKit guy to attempt it.
[15:06:01] detronizator: AutomatedTester: dude, I hope you have a nice smile on your face, otherwise I'd assume you have been upset by my excess of sarcasm
[15:06:02] detronizator: :)
[15:08:32] AutomatedTester: :)
[15:09:13] detronizator: jimevans: do I remember correctly that you used mongoose inside the IEDriverServer?
[15:11:04] jimevans: detronizator: indeed i did, but my implementation was very very targeted and simplisitic.
[15:11:42] detronizator: jimevans: don't put yourself down - go ahead and rewrite the PhantomJS WebServe module (RECRUITE MODE ON)
[15:12:35] jimevans: i'm not putting myself down. i kept it simple for a reason. :) but i'm not ready to tackle that right now.
[15:13:19] jimevans: now, can i modify webpage.cpp so that a method takes a QWebElement* and doesn't break anything...
[15:14:38] detronizator: jimevans: takes a QWebElement?
[15:14:55] detronizator: and where would you take a QWebElement* from outside the page?
[15:15:47] detronizator: jimevans: once extracted from the origin page, a QWebElement* is like any other QObject
[15:15:56] detronizator: it should at least...
[15:16:20] jimevans: good question. if i'm in phantomjs and i do a document.findElementById() what type do i have? 
[15:16:26] adamgoucher has joined #selenium
[15:17:00] detronizator: where do you execute the "findElementById"? within the page context?
[15:17:05] jimevans: yes.
[15:17:24] detronizator: and you want the Element to be "visible" from OUTSIDE that context?
[15:17:34] jimevans: (see, this is why i don't like monkeying around with phantomjs code. the architecture is baffling to me right now)
[15:18:46] jimevans: so here's the problem i'm trying to solve. i need to rearchitect WebPage::uploadFile() so that i can reference the element, not just a selector.
[15:19:03] detronizator: coding phantomjs source it's made of 3 phases: 1) no idea what they are doing 2) what the FUCK those idiots are doing 3) now I see why they are doing such horrible things 4) QtWebKit in Qt4 sucks big time for the kind of stuff PhantomJS wants to do.
[15:19:07] jfunk has joined #selenium
[15:19:23] detronizator: jimevans: why?
[15:20:42] jimevans: to support file uploads in ghostdriver, we need to call the "native" uploadFile() method, but right now, uploadFile() takes a "selector" and does a m_currentFrame->findFirstElement(selector). 
[15:22:20] jimevans: OR, i could expose a method to simply set the file name on the page object. didn't see that.
[15:23:33] detronizator: anyway, the issue at the moment is that a WebElement is such only within the boundaries of his page and the native code of it. If you "extract" a WebElement from a page and what to manipulate into another page
[15:23:36] detronizator: it's not going to work
[15:23:45] detronizator: those are "bound" to their origin page
[15:23:52] detronizator: internal pointers and shit like that

[16:24:14] jimevans: uh-oh
[16:24:27] dawagner: In inputs.js, you added an if (!element) clause
[16:24:44] dawagner: Except the type annotation suggests element can never be null or undefined
[16:24:57] jimevans: alright.
[16:25:00] dawagner: Any idea what this was for?
[16:26:24] jimevans: i don't remember *exactly*, but the sendKeys advanced user interaction doesn't require an element, so we needed to handle that case.
[16:26:51] dawagner: Ok :) Thanks
[16:27:07] jimevans: and honestly, i've paid no attention to the type annotations, because i don't know anything about them. which is why i avoid messing about in the atoms code as much as possible.

[17:48:59] goddard: im trying to use the selenium driver and it works good on Linux but not on WIndows
[17:49:07] goddard: i keep getting illegalStateException
[17:49:28] goddard: the path to the driver executable must be set by the web driver . chrome driver system property
[17:50:18] lukeis: jimevans: why don't we just call it directly then instead of duplicating... page.uploadFile(<locator for element>, <file path>); ... but means we'd need to create a locator :-/
[17:51:22] jimevans: lukeis: right you are! now, how do i do that?
[17:51:41] lukeis: which part? :)
[17:51:52] goddard: what does this mean? "The chromedriver binary is in the system path, or"
[17:52:47] lukeis: goddard: in a command line shell you should `echo $PATH` or on windows `echo %PATH%` and make sure the chromedriver executable is in one of those locations
[17:53:34] jimevans: lukeis: given an element, generate a locator for it. bear in mind that in this case, "locator" means "css selector", given the phantomjs implementation of uploadFile().
[17:54:17] lukeis: maybe: "input[type='file'][name='" + webelement.getAttribute('name') + "']"
[17:54:34] lukeis: the getting attribute name is likely an atom call ;)
[17:55:12] lukeis: then we'll have to figure out multiple file uploads in the future... regular webdriver doesn't handle them yet either ;)
[17:55:15] goddard: im using the chrome driver and inside a java program
[17:55:15] jimevans: and if the name is blank?
[17:55:28] goddard: what does this mean in regards to this setup "The Selenium Server was started with -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=c:\path\to\your\chromedriver.exe" 
[17:55:33] goddard: thats from the wiki
[17:56:31] lukeis: jimevans: well then... is the WD id actually put on the element as an attribute? I forget how that is set... maybe we could use that
[17:56:56] lukeis: WD id == WD Element id
[17:57:20] jimevans: no, afaik, we don't augment the HtmlElement object.
[17:57:29] goddard: i thought this was enough usingChromeDriverExecutable(new File(chromeDriver))
[17:57:50] lukeis: jimevans: maybe we should temporarily then... set the ID to WDElementID and then set it back to the original
[17:57:54] goddard: im even using the exact settings on te wiki "C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe"
[17:58:25] lukeis: goddard: is there a problem simply putting the chromedriver on the system path?
[17:58:25] jimevans: goddard: that's the location of chrome.exe (the chrome browser itself), not the chromedriver.exe.
[17:58:27] goddard: can i use %USERNAME% variables in java?
[17:58:40] lukeis: ha, that too :) (good catch jimevans)
[17:59:02] goddard: right and i just dropped the chromedriver.exe into system32

[18:09:46] goddard: but yeah 
[18:10:18] *jimevans is trying to narrow down whether the java bindings aren't finding chromedriver.exe, or chrome.exe.
[18:11:04] jimevans: because looking at the code, i'm not sure Java knows how to expand environment variables.
[18:11:07] lukeis: he shouldn't be doing that stuff at all...  everything listed shows standard paths.... this.chromeWebDriver = new ChromeDriver();
[18:11:10] lukeis: that's it
[18:11:18] jimevans: no, i agree.
[18:11:55] jimevans: but if there's ever a need to customize the locations, then we need to know that.
[18:12:23] jimevans: although, you're right, that's probably premature optimization.
