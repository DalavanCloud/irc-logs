[12:27:29] omaz_lt: and how should I run ~50 firefox instances on 1 machine. Should I use 1 selenium node, o run several java instances of nodes?

[14:14:07] crankharder: RossPatterson: is there a write up somewhere on using htmlunit w/ selenium?
[14:14:32] crankharder: w/ ruby webdriver
[14:14:43] RossPatterson: It's just another browser driver.  Instead of creating a FirefoxDriver or a ChromeDriver, you create an HtmlUnitDriver.
[14:14:52] RossPatterson: After that, all your code is the same.

[14:15:05] crankharder: right, but i have ot have htmlunit installed somewhere, no?

[14:27:31] dawagner: jimevans: Is there a handy way to make the IEDriverServer listen in /wd/hub rather than / ?
[14:27:44] BarbS: hello
[14:27:51] jimevans: dawagner: not really. why?
[14:28:24] dawagner: I'm trying to use it directly in an environment which hard-codes that a server should be listening on /wd/hub as the java server does - IIRC the chromedriver lets you set a prefix path
[14:28:31] dawagner: But I can change the hard-coding :)
[14:29:02] BarbS: I have a question. I am trying to do drag and drop between frames and it is not working. I am having the following error: Element belongs to a different frame 
[14:29:18] jimevans: yeah, i'd change the hard-coding. i thought that's why all of the driver constructors allowed you to specify a url for the server.
[14:29:47] crankharder: RossPatterson: any ideas why I can't find these strings after clicking the input here? https://gist.github.com/4be44f055140b44730ca

[14:35:58] BarbS: help?
[14:37:57] lukeis: RossPatterson / crankharder I think you pass in a JavaScript:true flag in the desired capabilities (sorry don't know exact syntax off the top of my head)

[14:39:43] BarbS: I know is really tricky
[14:39:57] lukeis: BarbS: I don't think that will work with the way selenium is coded... patches welcome? :)
[14:40:11] jimevans: BarbS: i think you're going to be out of luck going cross-frame like that.
[14:40:41] BarbS: Yeah, patches are welcomed... i am working in Python
[14:40:43] jimevans: what browser?
[14:40:45] BarbS: :)
[14:40:48] BarbS: FF
[14:40:55] jimevans: on what OS?
[14:41:02] BarbS: window 7
[14:41:05] crankharder: got past the enablign javascript, but now i guess there are problems with the javascript on the page i'm hitting, and webdriver is choking
[14:41:09] crankharder: Selenium::WebDriver::Error::UnknownError: Invalid JavaScript value of type net.sourceforge.htmlunit.corejs.javascript.MemberBox
[14:41:17] crankharder: (probably cause the site doesn't know what they're doing)
[14:41:36] crankharder: any way to disregard errors like that?
[14:41:53] jimevans: BarbS: native events was going to be my last "maybe this will work" suggestion, but they should already be enabled in that environment.
[14:42:29] jimevans: so i'm guessing you're probably out of luck.
[14:43:27] RossPatterson: crankharder: Sorry, NO idea how to do that.  In fact, I wasn't even aware that WebDriver caught such errors (which is cool!)
[14:43:35] lukeis: crankharder: Not really, you likely hit one of the many JS bugs in htmlunit. Your only chance to troubleshoot htmlunit is to work in java... Of course the upgrade to the latest htmlunit might help which will be in 2.26
[14:43:57] crankharder: lukeis: erm, how do i know what version i have? :)
[14:44:19] jimevans: crankharder: if all you're doing is scraping stuff off the web page, you might look at phantomjs instead of webdriver (there's a webdriver API in the works, but it's not quite ready yet)
[14:44:22] crankharder: oh, you mean the standalone server?  i'm on 2.25
[14:44:23] lukeis: It's in selenium itself... I forget what it was
[14:44:57] crankharder: i'm scraping, but i have to hit a link that ajaxy-posts a whole bunch of crap i've been unable to emulate otherwise, which is why im' trying the selenium/javascript approach now
[14:44:57] lukeis: We bundle htmlunit inside the standalone server
[14:45:33] lukeis: Your best bet is to use a real browser in this case
[14:45:48] RossPatterson: If the site is that AJAXy, you might REALLY want to run a real browser, even if that means installing X.
[14:45:51] crankharder: yea, that works, trying to avoid it tho :)
[14:46:24] jimevans: crankharder: i'm pretty sure phantomjs can handle the scenario you're asking for, because it's a lot closer to a "real" browser than htmlunit. a full browser stack would be best, of course.
[14:46:52] lukeis: When is phantomjs going 1.0? :)
[14:47:01] jimevans: phantomjs is at 1.7. :)
[14:47:14] RossPatterson: Oh, snap! :-)
[14:47:15] lukeis: Oh I meant ghost driver ;)
[14:47:24] crankharder: jimevans: already installed and trying it ;)
[14:47:47] jimevans: ghostdriver, on the other hand, ivan's working hard on it. he'd love some help, i'm sure. :)
[14:48:29] lukeis: jimevans: Is the stuff that you guys needed in the dev branch to make it run in 1.7 or going to ever be in a future release?
[14:49:02] jimevans: lukeis: some of it is, some of it isn't. ivan posts patches regularly back to the main phantomjs trunk.
[14:49:11] *lukeis will try to spend some time on ghostdriver soon :)
[14:49:28] brokenthumbs has joined #selenium
[14:49:41] jimevans: the long-term plan is to have all of ghostdriver directly integrated into phantomjs, so you'd invoke it something like './phantomjs --webdriver'
[14:49:52] lukeis: Nice
[14:49:59] jimevans: if that makes it into 1.8 remains to be seen.
[14:50:14] jimevans: phantomjs releases with the seasons, so 1.8 will be in december.
[14:52:03] crankharder: anyone happen to know how to find/click an element w/ phantomjs? been looking at examples and dont see that
[14:52:19] AutomatedTester: yay for IT meltdowns.
[14:53:34] jimevans: crankharder: how would you do it via plain javascript? finding the element would be done with document.getElementById() or similar.

[17:16:26] jimevans: detronizator: be ready to take notes! :)
[17:16:37] dawagner: While we haven't formally decided anything yet, convention has been to prefix browser-specific capabilities in the style of phantomjs.execPath rather than concatenating it all together
[17:17:34] detronizator: dawagner: can I be an asshole and ask you to comment in line here https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/commit/24c59a610a3e39b572fa476e2c61a08d621be36c
[17:17:40] dawagner: Absolutely :)

[17:21:19] Dude-X: adamgoucher: you tweeted that startups shouldn't use recruiters to find people; why's that?
[17:21:51] adamgoucher: they should be tapped in enough to the market to know who they want, and/or be interesting enough that people come to them
[17:23:37] Dude-X: huh… but as a startup, what if they are brand new? are they going to 'poach' people that they like
[17:25:11] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[17:26:06] dawagner: detronizator: Basically looks good :) (And like a pleasently small amount of code!)
[17:27:04] detronizator: dawagner: I think that's all thanks to the fact that the WireProtocol is wicked! I used just the plain RemoteWebDriver until today. This binding is purely just to handle the phantomjs execution.
[17:27:26] detronizator: I noticed that jleyba is reviewing the code to: thanks a lot!
[17:27:29] detronizator: too*
[17:29:13] RossPatterson: Dude-X: Sure.  That's what a head-hunter is going to do, and head-hunters never understand your business like you do.
[17:29:33] adamgoucher: Dude-X: startups dont operate in a void though. they should know people in the community that are looking and are worth getting. but i also think that the trend of looking for a 'technical co-founder' is ridiculous
[17:34:15] adamgoucher: if, say, you were a python startup, its part of the founders jobs to hang out a local python groups to find talent. or at devops events for find ops people.
[17:35:08] Dude-X: there's not too many QA/selenium meetups here though
[17:36:00] RossPatterson: Dude-X: Any startup focusing on Selenium ought to already have inroads into the Selenium community, geo-located or not.
[17:36:20] adamgoucher: theres at least 2 that exsted at some point in nyc.

[17:41:29] jimevans: i know i've asked this before, but i've forgotten. i have an open source library i want to consider using in the .NET bindings, licensed via the MS-PL. it's source-only (no binary), so how do I incorporate that into our copyright information in the source file?

[17:45:23] RossPatterson: I suspect the answer is "you don't".  MS-PL requires you to retain the author's copyright notice.

[18:50:23] toabctl has joined #selenium
[18:51:15] RossPatterson: You can't - Selenium only uses XPath to identify page elements.  You can't do anything else with XPath.
[18:52:03] kippesoep: hm k, thx
[18:52:17] kippesoep: any particular reason for this choice?
[18:55:25] RossPatterson: It's kinda fundamental.  Selenium isn't a general-purpose XPath processor, XPath is just one of several strategies it uses for locating elements.
[18:55:36] lucabox has joined #selenium
[18:55:43] kippesoep: hm, seems reasonable
[18:55:46] kippesoep: fair enough

[22:02:18] chogan: just one
[22:02:40] MadMerlin|work_: grr
[22:02:50] jimevans: okay, just a thought. i've seen javascript UI frameworks that put two elements with the same ID before.
[22:02:54] MadMerlin|work_: ie 6/7/8 are all giving me random js errors from webdriver
[22:03:39] *jimevans adds a rant about "random" to his list of blog posts to write.
[22:04:08] MadMerlin|work_: var res = document.__webdriver_evaluate(arguments[0], document, null, 7, null); <-- this line throws object doesn't support this property or method
[22:04:52] jimevans: you haven't said what you're trying to do, but let me use my psychic debugging powers...
[22:05:01] jimevans: are you trying to find an element or elements by xpath?
[22:05:37] AutomatedTester: :yt Hannah Geogas - Thick Skin
[22:05:37] selbot2_: Hannah Georgas-Thick Skin - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbLCCK-1heI&feature=youtube_gdata
[22:05:42] MadMerlin|work_: it's hard to tell exactly what commands are triggering the error
[22:05:53] MadMerlin|work_: because it doesn't happen all the time, and it happens in multiple different places in the test
[22:06:19] jimevans: well, surely you have a stack trace when it fails, right?
[22:07:33] MadMerlin|work_: sometimes, the error as it returns to me (ie, not the browser) is not always the same, sometimes i don't even see an error
[22:07:51] MadMerlin|work_: this particular time, it looks like it's selecting by xpath
[22:07:59] MadMerlin|work_: the current line and several of the previous lines
[22:08:45] jimevans: what version of webdriver are you using, and what version of the IEDriverServer.exe?
[22:09:05] chogan: Dude-X: nothing particularly fancy it looks
[22:09:17] MadMerlin|work_: 2.25 and... 2.25.3, respectively
[22:09:24] MadMerlin|work_: just downloaded both today
[22:09:34] chogan: talking to the devs and they can't think of anything tricky that field could be doing
[22:10:41] Dude-X: chogan: see if this works. put a thread sleep before clicking on the password field, and then another sleep
[22:11:04] MadMerlin|work_: i can try to narrow this down, i'm just wondering if anyone else has run into it
[22:11:12] *detronizator is off to play a bit of Black Mesa, after having watched the great talk from @stubbornella
[22:12:05] Dude-X: chogan: we just want to establish that using a bit of pause can make it work; if that's the case, then there might some javascript interfering; if it fails even with a sleep, then there's something unusual about the dOM structure
[22:12:57] jimevans: MadMerlin|work_: you've not given much to go on. there aren't any large global issues that prevent the IE driver from working outright. our ci server would've shown it if it were so.
[22:13:25] MadMerlin|work_: i wish i had more information, but i don't
[22:13:39] chogan: Dude-X: there are two versions of this login modal. For the one version, I did what you are describing and got that to work (i actually loop several times attempting to type each time until it lets me thru). But in the other version of the modal, sleeps don't make any difference
[22:14:00] Dude-X: other version?
[22:14:59] chogan: Dude-X: we have an older and a newer login modal (some brands have one, other the other)… the older one is actually doing less tricky js than the new one
[22:15:37] MadMerlin|work_: i want to say it usually happens during the loading of a page, but that's most of the time the test is running
[22:16:01] chogan: I'm assuming there is something tricky that I am missing, but was curious what y'all thought since the password input field was causing pain on both versions (even tho in different ways)
[22:16:38] MadMerlin|work_: it feels like the classic ie can't modify the page before it's done loading problem
[22:17:22] MadMerlin|work_: (combined with said problem's virtually impossible to debug properties)
[22:20:27] Dude-X: webdriver requires that a page finishes loading before it can start…. but i'm not sure that's related to your problem
[22:21:04] chogan: no i don't think so. I am able to interact with every other field in the form except the password
[22:21:28] chogan: tested this by pausing the run at the form and just pounding away at it with the ruby mine debugger
[22:22:15] Dude-X: well, if it's not finding it despite waiting a while
[22:22:16] chogan: thats when i saw that the password field element was invisible somehow until i manually clicked into it… thats the only way i could get pw_element.displayed? to be true
[22:22:50] Dude-X: do you use jquery or some js library?
[22:23:55] chogan: sorry, for the actual site code or for interacting with it?
[22:27:05] Dude-X: in the actual site
[22:27:26] Dude-X: you might get around it by having jquery or raw javascript get it into focus
[22:27:56] chogan: jquery
[22:31:18] Dude-X: you can execute script "$j('#password').focus()')"

[22:40:36] chogan: grr
[22:41:41] Dude-X: well you do switch to a frame right?
[22:41:52] chogan: yes
[22:41:54] Dude-X: ok
[22:41:58] chogan: haha
[22:42:24] Dude-X: me personally i have to refactor the code we use for TinyMCE
[22:42:33] Dude-X: which takes place inside an iframe
[22:43:04] Dude-X: our old code is only good for entering text, but to use some of the other features i have to rewrite the work of my predecessors
[22:43:51] chogan: ah… yeah i keep getting Se errors trying to execute script to grab the element
[22:43:56] chogan: tell me if I'm missing something:
[22:44:07] chogan: this works in the browser console:
[22:44:46] chogan: document.getElementById('mb-iframe').contentWindow.document.getElementByID('password').focus()
[22:45:31] chogan: but: driver.execute_script("document.getElementByID('mb-iframe')") 
[22:45:50] chogan: that gives an unknown Se error 
[22:46:11] Dude-X: i don't think that will work if you're inside an iframe
[22:46:55] Dude-X: why can't you use jquery?
[22:47:26] Dude-X: anyway i'm taking off i don't have much more insight at the moment
[22:47:41] chogan: k thanks for your time

[23:29:04] MadMerlin|work_: yeah, in the debugger i can see that document.__webdriver_evaluate is undefined
[23:29:09] MadMerlin|work_: which would explain the error
[23:32:48] MadMerlin|work_: looks like that is only called for xpath searches... let's try removing the xpath
[23:41:46] jimevans: MadMerlin|work_: you could also try a later IEDriverServer, like the one checked into the prebuilts directory in subversion (http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cpp/prebuilt/Win32/Release/)
[23:42:38] jimevans: finding by xpath is now embedded as part of the automation atoms for IE, so it's a little more robust.
