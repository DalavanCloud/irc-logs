[12:13:43] AutomatedTester: bbiab
[12:15:53] Tvdberk: I have a question about locators. I have a page with multiple elements with the same ids but only 1 of them is active. however if i try to locate the active element using the id, an inactive element is found. is there a solution for this problem without setting a complicated xpath selector to get the correct element?
[12:17:55] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[12:18:18] Dude-X_: Tvdberk, are these elements are in different divs?
[12:18:56] Tvdberk: dude-X_: yes the elements are in different divs
[12:19:27] Dude-X_: are the divs sufficiently different enough that you can make distinct locators?
[12:19:48] Tvdberk: dude-X_: not realy
[12:20:27] Tvdberk: the xpath will look something like this: //div[@id='interactions-message']/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div/div/div/fieldset/div/div/input[@class='jq_interactions-name']
[12:20:48] Dude-X_: that's a terrible xpath
[12:20:54] Tvdberk: i know
[12:21:11] Dude-X_: are you working with IDE, RC, or webdriver?
[12:21:20] Tvdberk: webdriver
[12:21:45] Dude-X_: let's suppose that all the input tags are not unique enough
[12:22:22] Dude-X_: the easiest way around is to do something like find_elements(locator)[2] 
[12:22:34] Dude-X_: where you know for sure you want the 3rd button 
[12:23:23] Dude-X_: or you can do an appropriate wait, then do use a for loop on find_elements and then check; is_displayed; if it's true, then interact with it
[12:23:25] dhpe: The tree should contain only one element with the same id. If it contains multiple elements with the same ID and it is not in your control, I would not use the ID as a locator.
[12:25:09] Tvdberk: Thanks dude :) that can be a very good solution to check the is_displayed

[17:30:52] aivaturi: yeah I'm using 2.25
[17:31:28] Dude-X: probably because it produces that for the Java remote server

[17:45:25] aivaturi: looks like it, actually ghostdriver gets the data from phantomjs which in turn uses mongoose…there is a whole lotta chain :)

[17:55:57] aivaturi: that might explain a lot - let me refresh my tree & try again
[17:56:00] jimevans: including one that parses the body from the http request as utf-8 instead of using the local code page.
[17:56:13] aivaturi: thanks for the help
[17:57:26] jimevans: incidentally, just about anywhere in the ghostdriver code, you can do a console.log('whatever') to get debugging output to the console window.
[17:57:59] aivaturi: yeah, I'm getting used to this javascript thingy :)

[20:44:45] jimevans: you should console.log(req.post) before the JSON.parse line in _postNewSessionCommand in session_manager_request_handler.js.
[20:46:18] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[20:47:38] aivaturi: it is a JSON object, so I did JSON.stringify before the parse
[20:48:14] aivaturi: if I just do console.log(req.post) it just outputs [object object]
[20:48:52] jimevans: aha. then it's pre-parsed into an object. that's not what's supposed to happen.

[21:49:53] barancev: I suspect it is the reason for 2x slowdown of FF on XP 
[21:50:14] AutomatedTester: barancev: in general 
[21:50:29] AutomatedTester: or just via firefoxdriver?
[21:50:56] stephend has joined #selenium
[21:51:53] barancev: FF only, no IE slowdown
[21:52:21] AutomatedTester: wow, let me see if there is a bug for that
[21:52:29] AutomatedTester: 2x slow down on Firefox is bad
[21:52:38] AutomatedTester: if it was just FirefoxDriver that might be ok-ish
[21:53:59] admc has joined #selenium
[21:54:04] barancev: on Sep 27th santi wrote "we just moved from xp sp3 to 2003 server" (when discussed IE6 version number)
[21:54:39] barancev: on Sep 21st (that is several days before) we got FF 2x slowdown on XP
[21:55:00] AutomatedTester: barancev: so Firefox in general or via FirefoxDriver?
[21:55:37] barancev: I don't know, I analyze CI job execution time
[21:55:44] barancev: that includes all
[21:56:48] AutomatedTester: ahhh so it could be Se code
[21:57:21] barancev: yes. how could we separate?
[21:58:23] barancev: no IE slowdow, no FF on linux slowdown, only FF on XP
[21:58:53] barancev: I'm going to run the same FF tests on Win7 environment to compare
[21:58:54] AutomatedTester: first thing, was FF updated around that time?
[21:59:00] brokenthumbs_ has joined #selenium
[21:59:10] AutomatedTester: if no then its likely Se code
[21:59:16] barancev: AutomatedTester: that's what santi should know too
[21:59:41] AutomatedTester: sounds like you got it all under control and I am getting in the way ;)
[21:59:43] barancev: but FF on XP is not exactly the same as XP on server 2003

[22:02:15] jimevans: detronizator: i think _postMouseMoveToCommand() in session_request_handler is slightly incorrect.
[22:02:21] jimevans: and i'm having trouble fixing it.
[22:03:02] detronizator: jimevans: what's wrong with it?
[22:03:21] jimevans: if an element is specified, and no offset, the mouse should be moved to the center of the element.
[22:03:42] jimevans: it's currently moving to the top-left corner.
[22:04:10] detronizator: should it?
[22:04:29] QAGuy has joined #selenium
[22:05:06] detronizator: u r right

[22:05:44] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: sorry its not out yet
[22:06:18] jimevans: i *think* fixing that might resolve a few of the position and drag-drop issues i'm having with the .net tests.

[22:07:41] jimevans: detronizator: i've tried replicating what you've done with the location stuff, but the get_size atom seems to be returning errors, rather than a valid json response.
[22:07:46] Dude-X: goddard: i wrap all driver calls; so a call to driver.close() will check for window handles > 1
[22:07:53] jimevans: or rather the expected size structure
[22:09:17] jimevans: oh. wait. i think i see the proble.
[22:09:36] jimevans: detronizator: btw, i sent you another pull request relating to getCssPropertyValue.

[22:12:58] Dude-X: webdriver tries it's best to scroll
[22:13:17] jimevans: detronizator: i think i've got it sussed out.
[22:13:20] barancev: AutomatedTester: javascript tests in FF on XP are not slowed down
[22:13:24] detronizator: jimevans: super!
[22:13:59] jimevans: detronizator: it's the difference between calling the atom directly and calling executeScript on the atom. :)
[22:14:10] AutomatedTester: barancev: ok, that still doesnt rule out Firefox because it could be a perf issue with Chrome<->Content communications
[22:15:23] detronizator: jimevans: yes - I think there might be some places where I have to relook at the way I used the atoms. Initially I haven't really understood what the "execute_script" one was "adding" to the party.
[22:15:40] detronizator: now that I actually looked at the code, I know much better what should and shouldn't be called through that.
[22:15:50] detronizator: but some might have fallen through the cracks

[22:30:54] aivaturi: why is the charset not being set?
[22:31:09] aivaturi: also shouldn't the content-type be application/json?

[23:48:05] goddard: Dude-X: i am using the web driver on a work station and I was thinking of having some kind of service that would launch a chrome web driver and do some start up stuff like login and what not if the driver wasn't already started
[23:48:22] goddard: if it was I was just going to do the requested action instead of opening a new instance

[23:49:01] goddard: im kind of new to selenium so if there is a better way please let me know
[23:49:50] Dude-X: it's better to start up and shut down after every test run
[23:49:56] Dude-X: because there may be memory leaks and so on
[23:51:53] goddard: what i am doing isn't exactly test related .. it is more automation of some stupid tasks.. transfering data from one system to another
