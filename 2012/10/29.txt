[04:38:32] twittard: Hi, anyone around? I'm not sure where this bug exists that I'm hitting.
[04:38:49] twittard: Whether it's with the Selenium Server (RC) or with the Ruby webdriver... etc.
[04:39:06] twittard: Basically I've had to change my RSpec test to execute jQuery to tell whether a Form Select has been disabled or not.
[04:39:22] twittard: I basically disable it and then re-enable it.  But Selenium still reports it as disabled.
[04:39:36] twittard: Where-as $("#id").is(":disabled") is false

[12:53:13] jimevans: eranm: so which linux issue specifically are you looking at? the noFocusLib one, or the copy-paste one?

[12:53:42] eranm: copy-paste not working is only not working on specific window managers, which apparently sauce use
[12:53:47] eranm: Works fine on gnome, kde.
[12:54:05] jimevans: a-ha. good to know. we'll need to ask santiycr about that one.
[12:54:14] eranm: Perhaps the xclipboard services should be started explicitly  
[12:54:19] jimevans: or, we can mark the tests not to run on sauce too.

[15:54:02] lukeis: good news then :-D
[15:55:34] Androidnewbe: lukeis any idea how can i run multiple borwsers per one test in cucumber ?
[15:56:26] lukeis: i don't use cucumber… and don't know it all, but in other languages it's as simple as Variable1 = driver(); Variable2 = driver();
[15:56:58] Androidnewbe: exactly
[15:57:01] Androidnewbe: :(
[15:57:13] Androidnewbe: in new to ruby as well

[16:01:44] lukeis: if IDE could record multiple tests and export them all with appropriate page objects, then it would be worth while ;)
[16:03:30] Androidnewbe: maybe im really new to everything so it look usefull for siple test but probably for more experienced people and more coplicated interfaces it might not we that usefull
[16:04:33] Androidnewbe: btw what is the short cut here to type in someones nick name ?
[16:05:03] Androidnewbe: if I want put a comment to someone specificaly ?

[16:51:56] santiycr: I'm turning it on right now
[16:52:08] jimevans: santiycr: also - "eranm: Perhaps the xclipboard services should be started explicitly"

[16:52:15] santiycr: it will be up in production within the next 6hs
[16:52:38] santiycr: alright, we can do that
[16:52:54] jimevans: santiycr: thanks, mate. let's see what the reinstating of the window manager does.
[16:52:56] santiycr: how can I test it works?
[16:54:07] barancev: santiycr: make a commit to trigger the build
[16:54:32] jimevans: um, not sure. i know that org.openqa.selenium.TypingTest.testChordControlCutAndPaste fails on linux with native events.
[16:54:42] jimevans: or, yeah, what barancev said.

[17:02:54] dude-x: Androidnewbe: no, but what you want to look up is how to configure the test dispatcher
[17:04:01] dude-x: maybe there's a plug in that allows multiple tests or multiple hosts
[17:04:06] dude-x: via processes
[17:04:21] dude-x: or you can hand craft it in the test set up

[18:13:23] bfife: it builds the client/server but cant find the firefox profile when running, so i'm missing some libs somewhere

[18:16:43] goner: Hi all, got a question about ChromeDriver on Linux
[18:16:58] SamuraiJack has joined #selenium
[18:17:11] goner: i've installed the binary, but i don't know how to get it working with the selenium-standalone-server.jar
[18:17:49] dude-x: you have to start the RemoteWebDriver with chrome as a your desiredCapability
[18:17:50] goner: i'm using '*chrome' as the -htmlSuite
[18:18:12] goner: dude-x: can i do this via command-line?
[18:18:20] goner: it's part of a jenkins job
[18:18:40] dude-x: yes
[18:18:50] goner: java -jar /home/egon/selenium-server-standalone-2.23.1.jar -browserSessionReuse -htmlSuite *chrome
[18:19:03] goner: that's part of the shell command i'm calling
[18:19:32] goner: but it's complaining about firefox in the logs, and running the chromedriver binary i don't see any log output
[18:19:48] SamuraiJack has joined #selenium
[18:20:07] goner: selenium confuses the hell out of me to be honest
[18:20:30] dude-x: i don't know what is -htmlSuite
[18:20:40] jimevans: goner: okay, let's take a step back. are you using the rc api or the webdriver api?
[18:20:50] lukeis: bfife: no one really builds the whole thing in an IDE (afaik)… we use the command line
[18:20:53] dude-x: but there's an option -browser i think that takes a json formatted string
[18:21:18] goner: jimevans: i have "selenium-server-standalone-2.23.1.jar"
[18:21:29] goner: that's all i know. webdriver i think...
[18:21:45] jimevans: goner: right, but there are two different APIs you can use, and they're both included in the .jar.
[18:21:50] lukeis: htmlSuite implies not...
[18:22:01] goner: okay
[18:22:06] goner: maybe that's my problem then
[18:22:14] lukeis: looks like you're trying to run an Export of SeIDE?
[18:22:20] jimevans: if your code looks like "driver.findElement(…)", you're using webdriver. if it looks like "selenium.waitForPageToLoad()", that's selenium rc.
[18:22:33] adamgoucher: -htmlSuite is only rc
[18:22:57] lukeis: jimevans: his code might not have either and be *shudder* selenese 
[18:23:32] goner: lukeis: they are html files...
[18:23:43] lukeis: yup…
[18:23:49] goner: i'm not the one writing the scripts (ultimately)
[18:23:53] jimevans: okay, i'm done here, then. 
[18:24:13] goner: i'm just in charge of getting it working with chrome in a headless Xvfb env.
[18:24:47] goner: it works with -htmlSuite '*firefox' and -htmlSuite '*iexplore'
[18:25:32] lukeis: goner: you're in extremely outdated territory that not many people here know how to futz with
[18:25:54] goner: lukeis: am I that far behind the times?
[18:25:58] lukeis: :)
[18:26:12] goner: this whole RC/webdriver thing is so confusing
[18:26:51] lukeis: well, RC was using a (real) programming language and WebDriver is a cleaner / much nicer API (with a lot of other benefits)
[18:27:53] lukeis: you're using something called Selenese (html) which is what the Selenium IDE uses
[18:27:58] bfife: lukeis: got a handy cli for starting up a remote debugger port then?
[18:27:59] bfife: :>
[18:28:32] goner: lukeis: are you saying that the chromedriver doesn't support selenese?
[18:28:34] lukeis: bfife: ummm, it's something like adding "debug" on the command line… have to look it up ;)
[18:28:42] lukeis: goner: correct
[18:29:02] goner: if I could find a list of the switches supported by selenium-standalone.jar that might help
[18:29:05] lukeis: if you want chrome to work the way you're going you don't need chromedriver at all
[18:29:09] bfife: -debug just has more verbose messages
[18:29:21] goner: bfife: thx
[18:29:45] alexglow has joined #selenium

[18:30:12] jimevans: but i really don't know what i'm talking about.\
[18:30:18] goner: thought i tried that already
[18:30:38] jimevans: '*chrome' and '*googlechrome' are two very, very different things

[19:18:41] bfife: i think bot.dom.isShown is misbehaving on me :(
[19:19:12] lukeis: bfife: another way is to start the debug-server and then go to one of the test pages (especially one that attempts to test the functionality you care about)
[19:19:14] dude-x: in what ways?
[19:19:39] bfife: i have a very visible element that isShown thinks is not visible

[19:22:48] bfife: it was happening as recently as 18006, which is why i went backwards to find where it started
[19:23:13] bfife: i also tried applying a newer closure / compiler to a revision around 18010 but that didnt fix it

[19:26:11] lukeis: (good way to start)
[19:27:24] bfife: another fun part about this exercise is that it's only happening on a live application page. if i save the page and edit all the js references, it's not reproducible

[19:28:02] lukeis: javascript conflict?
[19:28:46] bfife: i dont think so.. only happening in ff. works fine in chrome. worked fine in 2.25.0 or r < 17783. broke in 17784
[19:30:23] lukeis: then I probably would load up firefox with webdriver and firebug and fiddle around in the cosole
[19:30:27] lukeis: consol*
[19:30:32] lukeis: console* :)
[19:30:49] bfife: can i hit the goog. or dom. objects from there?
[19:30:58] lukeis: ah, maybe not
[19:31:11] lukeis: you need to load the atoms
[19:31:39] lukeis: hmm… i haven't done that yet (load them into an existing site)
[19:32:07] bfife: am i just dumping them into the docroot and adding script refs?
[19:32:13] lukeis: you can see how the tests do it (if you start the debug server and go to the link i showed) with test_bootstrap.js
[19:32:17] bfife: k
[19:33:56] barancev: bfife: is this live app page available?

[21:05:33] matthewrobbins has joined #selenium
[21:08:11] lukeis: i don't personally agree with how it's been done in the past… 2.X marked deprecated then 2.X+1 removed. I consider those point releases
[21:09:19] jimevans: lukeis: see, i don't consider those point releases.
[21:09:44] lukeis: on a weekly cycle like we (were) doing they should be
[21:10:22] lukeis: but then again, we don't follow apache versioning :)
[21:11:07] lukeis: you could say then they are minor releases… and even those shouldn't be removing deprecated items
[21:11:35] dude-x: wind is getting angry behind my building
[21:11:47] jimevans: again, i disagree. each release in the 2.x cycle is a major release.
[21:12:04] jimevans: otherwise, i get stuck with some horrible api choices.
[21:12:05] lukeis: major release is 2.x -> 3.x
[21:12:18] barancev: it's "grand release"
[21:12:22] lukeis: ha
[21:12:31] jimevans: lukeis: a major release is whatever we say a damn major release is.
[21:12:38] lukeis: ;)

[21:12:49] barancev: for 2.x -> 3.x release the deprecated feature is RC
[21:13:12] barancev: to be removed
[21:13:29] lukeis: yeah… i think we need to officially mark all the RC classes as deprecated though
