[14:42:32] jimevans: barancev: bit rot, at least in the case of .net. when the .net firefox driver was created, the java bindings were used as a template for implementation, and they similarly used the preferences from the source code. when java was changed to read from a json file, the .net bindings didn't pick up the change.

[15:07:12] dawagner: Ish.
[15:07:24] dawagner: It compiles more than it needs, but in ways I understand
[15:07:27] dawagner: Why?
[15:08:05] andreastt: Speed is the only issue.  It's fairly slow.
[15:08:43] dawagner: Someone should spend some time enabling the parellelism in rake
[15:09:03] andreastt: It supports such modern features?
[15:09:05] andreastt: Blimey.

[15:10:46] toabctl has joined #selenium
[15:11:02] andreastt: True, but that's only due to lack of capacity?
[15:11:50] andreastt: If we could run all CI jobs at once, with no queue, a total run would only be as slow as the slowest single job.
[15:12:14] andreastt: (Native events on IE7 take roughly 40 mins.)
[15:12:45] dawagner: andreastt: And that's with the tests only running three at a time
[15:12:56] dawagner: We could potentially run them all in parallel, with enough capacity

[21:18:11] jimevans: barancev: the tricky bit is that the coordinates you have there are coordinates in the DOM of the document you're looking in.
[21:18:35] jimevans: if the document is in a frame/iframe, those are *not* the same as the screen coordinates within the window bounds.
[21:18:51] barancev: jimevans: yes, I understand
[21:20:15] jimevans: so if GetFrameOffset() fails (which it might), you'll be clicking somewhere on the screen other than the element you want.
[21:21:01] jimevans: if you really really wanted to take a crack at debugging where the actual mouse pointer is, add a call to ::SetCursorPos() right before the click, and see where the mouse cursor ends up.

[21:45:31] AutomatedTester: and its lost
[21:45:45] KaibutsuX: I have
[21:45:51] KaibutsuX: I assume I only need to sign it once?
[21:46:21] AutomatedTester: yea
[21:46:25] KaibutsuX: ok
[21:46:31] AutomatedTester: once you have signed it we own all your codes
[21:46:45] KaibutsuX: all my base
[21:47:46] davehunt: hmm, I don't think that was quite what I meant
[21:48:14] Ardesco has joined #selenium
[21:48:25] AutomatedTester: davehunt: I know its not what you mean but I will land thins and then do yours
[21:48:33] davehunt: ah, gotcha
[21:48:38] KaibutsuX: yeah this was just for cmd line params to the driver
[21:48:42] davehunt: you didn't want to cause a conflict :)
[21:48:49] AutomatedTester: yup
[21:49:27] detronizator: jimevans: I have cherry-picked all but 1 of your pull reqs
[21:49:33] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: what does your tree look like
[21:49:38] detronizator: I had to do that way, because your pull request was not "rebased"
[21:49:40] jimevans: woot!
[21:49:47] jimevans: ah.
[21:49:53] AutomatedTester: it might be that I am tired but I need to fix your patch to land it
[21:49:54] detronizator: next time, before pushing, rebase it
[21:50:00] jimevans: sure.
[21:50:12] detronizator: otherwise will have empty merges
[21:50:13] jimevans: i'm not happy with the upload fix anyway.
[21:50:14] detronizator: :)
[21:50:25] detronizator: the upload fix will look at it with a fresh mind
[21:50:30] detronizator: don't want to risk it now :)
[21:50:34] detronizator: the other stuff seems legit
[21:50:43] detronizator: you rock sir
[21:50:46] jimevans: no. we'll need to make a change to phantomjs to get it working.
[21:50:51] davehunt: I have to go, early flight tomorrow
[21:50:56] jimevans: thanks, mate. just trying to get things done.
[21:51:02] jimevans: safe travels, my friend.
[21:51:07] detronizator: jimevans: what needs a fix?
[21:51:15] detronizator: the upload stuff?
[21:51:21] jimevans: yeah. file uploading.
[21:51:26] davehunt: :)
[21:51:38] detronizator: I'm sure stuff is needed there: I took a quick look to our C++ side - it's very basic
[21:51:57] jimevans: we just need a way to pass an element reference, rather than a selector.
[21:52:22] detronizator: with Element reference you mean the actual DOM Element?
[21:52:29] detronizator: or the JSON Element that WD uses?
[21:52:31] jimevans: right.
[21:52:56] jimevans: the actual DOM element, unless you can get the click to work properly.
[21:53:05] jimevans: i was unable to bend it to my will.
[21:55:28] detronizator: jimevans: tomorrow I'll see if something can be done to have a QObject* "passable around" in the PhantomJS scope
[21:55:42] jimevans: cool.
[21:56:01] detronizator: jimevans: I have an issue with the Java tests (that still rely on external websites)
[21:56:15] detronizator: there is one of the frame tests that uses something that seems to be a Selenium CI server
[21:56:26] detronizator: and that seems down since... 3/4 days ago
[21:56:33] detronizator: any other location for that stuff?
[21:56:41] jimevans: detronizator: oh, that needs to be kicked.
[21:56:56] detronizator: mmm, no stable location for that stuff?
[21:57:00] AutomatedTester: ahh nothing like patches not going on cleanly
[21:57:13] jimevans: :note dawagner can you kick the hosted test pages at ci.seleniumhq.com?
[21:57:14] selbot2_: ok!
[21:57:29] jimevans: detronizator: that's supposed to *be* the stable location.
[21:57:54] detronizator: jimevans: ah, ok. so it's only temporarily down.
[21:58:00] jimevans: rihgt.
[21:58:01] detronizator: in that case it's a no-op for me
[21:58:02] detronizator: :)

[22:09:17] KaibutsuX: AutomatedTester: I am currently on 2.23
[22:09:41] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: ok, that explains why it doesnt apply cleanly
[22:09:49] AutomatedTester: the other thing is the folder layout 
[22:11:00] Spanktar_ has joined #selenium
[22:11:36] KaibutsuX: i'm sorry, what do you want to know?
[22:11:57] AutomatedTester: where you get selenium/selenium/webdriver from
[22:12:03] AutomatedTester: the other thing, I am really confused
[22:12:34] AutomatedTester: doesnt chromedriver handle switches via desired capabilities anymore
[22:12:47] AutomatedTester: jimevans: ^
[22:13:37] KaibutsuX: ohhh, we store the selenium folder inside another selenium folder where I am
[22:14:12] KaibutsuX: so it should just be selenium/webdriver
[22:14:25] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: to allow easy to land patches
[22:14:32] AutomatedTester: use the selenium projects layout
[22:14:38] KaibutsuX: my bad
[22:14:58] AutomatedTester: atm, I cant see why this patch is needed
[22:15:37] jimevans: AutomatedTester: near as i remember, there's a capability called chromeOptions the value of which is a json object
[22:15:39] AutomatedTester: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver only suggests via desired capabilties
[22:15:49] jimevans: one of the properties of the json object is 
[22:15:53] jimevans: "args"
[22:15:55] AutomatedTester: jimevans: thats what I do
[22:16:02] jimevans: which is an array of arguments for chrome.
[22:16:07] jimevans: then you should be golden.
[22:16:21] AutomatedTester: I handle chrome options and then do a to_capabiilities and pass that in with the rest of the capabilities
[22:16:43] jimevans: yep. sounds exactly right to me.
[22:18:00] KaibutsuX: AutomatedTester: but you aren't passing any options to the actual ChromeDriver executable are you? unless I'm missing that capability in 2.23?
[22:19:05] *AutomatedTester is going to rename variables so things look clearer
[22:19:13] AutomatedTester: everything is now called an option
[22:19:36] Dude-X: can you make that optional?
[22:21:01] KaibutsuX: AutomatedTester: I was looking specifically at chrome/webdriver.py in __init__ at self.service = Service(executable_path, port=port)
[22:21:17] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: yea, I see what you want
[22:21:20] KaibutsuX: oh ok
[22:21:33] AutomatedTester: naming it option makes the code confusing
[22:21:40] *AutomatedTester is renaming the variables
[22:22:20] KaibutsuX: alright that works, I have to go fix my sister's car now
[22:23:37] *AutomatedTester downloads chromedriver
[22:30:50] AutomatedTester: hmmm
[22:30:59] AutomatedTester: is alerts broken on Chrome?

[23:03:12] lukeis: :-D
[23:03:48] *lukeis is gonna add a phantomjs driver to python... which will need a service to start it similar to chromedriver
[23:06:04] lukeis: also am going to *finally* add the expected conditions Dude-X_ wrote so long ago ;) writing tests now
[23:07:16] AutomatedTester: is ghostdriver joining our tree?
[23:08:36] jimevans: AutomatedTester: not exactly. the ghostdriver code will be baked into phantomjs
[23:08:39] lukeis: nope... but chromedriver isn't in our tree either
[23:09:02] *AutomatedTester rephrases 
[23:09:09] jimevans: long-term you'll do something like "./phantomjs --webdriver"
[23:09:11] AutomatedTester: are we officially supporting ghostdriver
[23:09:23] jimevans: which will launch phantomjs with the webdriver support active.
[23:09:25] lukeis: not until it is officially released ;)
