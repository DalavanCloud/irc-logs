[13:30:41] RossPatterson: deanclkclk: CI systems don't have to "break" with new code versions.  We run JetBrains' "TeamCity" CI system and have dozens of check-ins every day, and the CI system works perfectly.
[13:31:39] RossPatterson: deanclkclk: Changes to the product code sometimes necessitate changes to the test code, but we treat tests as part of the coding/testing process, and we code-review both.
[13:33:10] ner0x has joined #selenium
[13:35:09] xtian_ has joined #selenium
[13:36:38] deanclkclk: so RossPatterson I am talking selenium test cases right
[13:36:47] RossPatterson: Right.
[13:37:04] deanclkclk: I guess Jenkins tries to run the test and it fails
[13:37:10] RossPatterson: We run about 2,000 Selenium tests in TeamCity daily.
[13:37:12] deanclkclk: because, maybe it is looking for an external server
[13:37:29] deanclkclk: external selenium server
[13:37:50] deanclkclk: or else I am missing something
[13:38:09] deanclkclk: robinsmidsrod: 
[13:38:12] deanclkclk: RossPatterson: 
[13:38:16] RossPatterson: When you say "selenium", which component are you talking about?  Selenium IDE, the Selenium RC API, or the WebDriver API?
[13:38:34] deanclkclk: WebDriver in Java project
[13:38:59] deanclkclk: so I use maven pom.xml to isntall the dependencies for my project....selenium server and java
[13:39:13] RossPatterson: And you use the browser-specific, in-process drivers (like FirefoxDriver)?  Or do you use RemoteDriver?
[13:39:23] deanclkclk: yep
[13:39:26] deanclkclk: FirefoxDriver
[13:40:07] deanclkclk: RossPatterson: 
[13:40:10] RossPatterson: OK, then you shouldn't need any external server.  With the in-process drivers in Java, you should just need the appropriate Selenium JAR file in your classpath.
[13:40:55] deanclkclk: well I only have <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId> 		    <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
[13:41:04] deanclkclk: and <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId> 		    <artifactId>selenium-server</artifactId>
[13:41:10] deanclkclk: that's it RossPatterson 
[13:41:36] deanclkclk: so in essence..I have to have the project running before I run the test
[13:41:36] RossPatterson: It sounds like you're having problems expressing your dependencies in Maven.  I'm afraid I can't help you with those.
[13:41:56] deanclkclk: and the target URL is localhost at this point
[13:42:06] deanclkclk: RossPatterson: 
[13:42:09] deanclkclk: not really
[13:42:09] dawagner has joined #selenium
[13:42:10] selbot2_: dawagner: note from jimevans 1 day ago: can you kick the hosted test pages at ci.seleniumhq.com? 
[13:42:57] RossPatterson: When you say "... have the project running ...", do you mean "... have the website deployed and ready to use from a browser"?
[13:43:50] deanclkclk: well no....wasn't thinking of that...I meant localhost...in Eclipse..I am using VM fabric TC server to run the project
[13:43:56] deanclkclk: RossPatterson: 
[13:44:08] RossPatterson: Sorry, too many non-Selenium parts I've never used.
[13:44:22] deanclkclk: so server runns...when I hit run in eclipse RossPatterson 
[13:44:40] deanclkclk: I don't have a standalone server locally
[13:44:49] deanclkclk: like tomcat
[13:45:44] deanclkclk: RossPatterson: 
[13:46:39] deanclkclk: so if the test is to be run against a remote machine deployed machine
[13:47:04] deanclkclk: I just need to point the target URL to the remote website with WebDriver default URL RossPatterson ?
[13:47:37] dawagner: :note jimevans I've modified the publish website build rule to be more resilient to failure, and running it brought the server back up :)
[13:47:39] selbot2_: ok!
[13:49:11] RossPatterson: You need to set the target URL to wherever the website-under-test is deployed.  If your CI system deploys it locally on the test machine (IMHO, the only correct choice), then localhost is the obvious answer.
[13:49:26] RossPatterson: If instead you deploy the website to a separate system, then yes, you need to set the target URL to that machine.
[13:49:58] deanclkclk: I see what u mean...it isn't on the CI machine...it's somewhere else
[13:50:58] deanclkclk: btw..what's the purpose of Selenium Server? I was reading this verbatim article that said I need for it to be setup if I wanna integrate with CI systems
[13:51:01] deanclkclk: @ RossPatterson 
[13:51:15] RossPatterson: If that's what you REALLY want to do (and I'd try to argue you out of it), then yes, set your target URL to wherever the site lives.
[13:51:41] deanclkclk: no I don't wanna selenium server but, trying to figure out what it is used for
[13:52:02] ner0x: Anyone use the perl bindings in here?
[13:52:10] deanclkclk: RossPatterson: 
[13:52:33] ner0x: Wondering what the difference in Test::WWW::Selenium and Selenium::Remote::Driver are.
[13:54:19] RossPatterson: deanclkclk: The stand-alone Selenium server can be used in CI environments, or in any other environment.  For some setups, it's necessary, for others it's optional.  It moves all the significant processing out of the test-process.  I think some language bindinings are built assuming that's how you'll do it, but I don't know which ones.  The Java and C# bindings operate either way - in-process with FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver, ..
[13:54:19] RossPatterson: ., and out-of-process with RemoteDriver.  In addition, if you want to use Selenium Grid, you MUST go out-of-process, because, well, the other servers in the grid ain't in your process :-)
[13:54:46] RossPatterson: ner0x: Sorry, not me.

[14:00:45] ner0x: Selenium RC deprecated?
[14:03:29] RossPatterson: ner0x: It depends on who you ask.  simonstewart's last comment was basically that all development goes into the WebDriver API, but the RC API will continue to be supported.  And he just fixed some RC code about a week ago.
[14:03:58] RossPatterson: Some others think RC is already dead, even though many of us are using it heavily.
[14:04:05] mdgreenfield has left #selenium
[14:04:49] eranm: RossPatterson and ner0x , I could say that in Google Selenium RC is officially deprecated and no longer supported
[14:05:13] eranm: Also, simonstewart is almost the only one who knows the inner workings of RC and can fix it.
[14:05:54] RossPatterson: I wouldn't argue with either of those comments.  And Google contributes a lot of time and energy to the WebDriver side of the Selenium Project.
[14:07:52] ner0x: WebDriver is definitely the new way of going about it though?
[14:08:02] ner0x: Can someone please explain RC vs WebDriver.
[14:08:12] ner0x: I'm going to try and update the perl bindings a bit.
[14:09:02] melter has joined #selenium
[14:09:38] RossPatterson: ner0x: There's a decent description of the differences at http://seleniumhq.org/docs/appendix_migrating_from_rc_to_webdriver.html

[14:10:43] AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
[14:11:30] RossPatterson: ner0X: There's also apparently a Perl binding for WebDriver. It's not built by the core team, but the author has done a lot of Selenium stuff in the past.  Take a look at https://metacpan.org/module/Selenium::Remote::Driver
[14:11:52] ner0x: RossPatterson: Right. I'm very familiar with those and I think I've even contributed a few times.
[14:12:03] ner0x: RossPatterson: Just have that vs Test::WWW::Selenium.

[15:24:01] deanclkclk: how can I resolve this problem

[15:32:14] deanclkclk: but, the selenium test default url is pointing to production
[15:32:18] deanclkclk: follow?
[15:32:32] deanclkclk: so any changes to the UI won't be tested when jenkins run the test
[15:32:48] deanclkclk: eranm: 
[15:32:50] eranm: So you want to run the Selenium tests against the dev environment? Why not specify the URL as a flag through jenkins

[15:46:26] pablol has joined #selenium
[15:48:03] eranm: deanclkclk, this sounds like a general Java problem, that happen to manifest itself through Selenium. You can deploy a stand-alone Selenium server with access to your development environment, you don't need Jenkins to do that for you.
[15:48:41] deanclkclk: eranm: I agree...I don't have selenium server standalone apart of my project
[15:49:03] deanclkclk: so if I am using selenium server standalone ...I don't need to use selenium server?

[15:51:34] keyword: hi guys I have a question exists some way where the user save some rutine in the browser and then reproduce this
[15:53:50] eranm: deanclkclk, you need the Selenium client bindings to compile your code with Selenium, obviously. And you need the Selenium Server only if you want the browser to run on a different machine than the one running the tests . Otherwise, you can just use the client bindings and it'll start the browser of your choice on the local machine.

[17:53:59] *detronizator is prepearing his second patch to Selenium: PhantomJSDriver.java coming to Selenium.
[17:54:42] lukeis: woot!  and thanks detronizator for merging my first pull to you! ;) 
[17:55:22] detronizator: lukeis: was a pleasure. And it's very elegant: I love intelligent recursion.
[17:55:47] aivaturi: lukeis: is there going to be a python equivalent? Or are we going to just use the remote?
[17:56:10] lukeis: there will be a python equivalent... working on it, working on something else first though
[17:56:30] aivaturi: sweet, thanks
[17:59:20] jleyba: detronizator, lukeis: I'm excited to see ghostdriver coming to the party, but are you planning on adding PhantomJSDriver.java to the selenium code base?
[17:59:29] jleyba: Shouldn't that live in a separate project like OperaDriver?
[17:59:51] lukeis: it's the same concept as ChromeDriver
[17:59:56] detronizator: the Java class is just the binding.
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Oct 11 18:00:02 2012]
[18:00:02] detronizator: yes, as lukeis says
[18:00:34] jleyba: Now that you mention it, ChromeDriver shouldn't live with us either
[18:00:39] detronizator: jleyba: It only handles the launch of the process (very basically - almost dumbly) and the proxy config (that is a configuration parameter in the current PhantomJS)
[18:00:50] jleyba: Might encourage people to file bugs in the correct place if they saw a different package name...
[18:01:04] andreastt: jleyba: I've been thinking along the same lines.
[18:01:45] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[18:02:05] detronizator: jleyba: andreastt: mmm, I have discussed this with different people in selenium
[18:02:25] detronizator: this is as tiny as possible: the binding is the only thing that will live in Selenium codebase
[18:02:42] detronizator: everything else is outside of the selenium project, as it should be.
[18:02:57] jleyba: I get what your saying, I'm just playing devil's advocate
[18:03:03] lukeis: if our only negative to having these inside the project is issue tracking / logging, I'm definitely against moving them out :)
[18:03:04] detronizator: the only issues that should be filed against "selenium" regarding PhantomJS should be only related to the binding
[18:03:16] jleyba: haha, that's not going to happen
[18:03:37] andreastt: I think it's fine for now; but at some point we need to look at the whole packaging process in Selenium in general.
[18:03:44] lukeis: yeah, detronizator we will certainly get ghostdriver / phantomjs bugs in selenium's issue tracker
[18:04:13] andreastt: I'd like to see certain parts of Selenium split out into smaller projects so that they more easily could be used as dependencies by driver implementations (and possibly other stuff).
[18:06:40] teodosia_sel has left #selenium
[18:06:53] detronizator: andreastt: jleyba: lukeis: I totally understand your worries and position. And I'll be ready to move things out once there is a strategy to make the specific drivers in one isolated place.
[18:07:16] detronizator: OR, maybe, I could publish a JAR for that stuff. But for 1 single tiny class looked like a massive overkill.
[18:07:18] andreastt: I just wanted you to be aware of the discussion (-:
[18:07:47] jleyba: ^ I'm not trying to block you either.  Just raising the issue
[18:08:32] detronizator: coolio ;)
[18:10:29] lukeis: well above and beyond the regular drivers there's integral pieces in the standalone server that need to know about them (even if they aren't in the project itself) ... detronizator we'll have to update that too at some point ;)
[18:11:51] andreastt: lukeis: I don't think registering a driver is much of an issue; dependency is something else entirely.
[18:12:21] friskd has joined #selenium
[18:12:23] lukeis: yep, i know... just thought of it as something else we need to do for phantomjs
[18:12:45] andreastt: detronizator: And then there is documentation (-;
[18:13:00] lukeis: who cares about docs? :-P
[18:18:17] detronizator: andreastt: lukeis: jleyba: I need to step out for an hour, but I'd love to know 1) with docs you need internal docs? 2) what do I need to do to make the "standalone server" aware?
[18:19:28] jleyba: detronizator: For the standalone server, update this map: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/server/DefaultDriverSessions.java#41
[18:19:50] lukeis: and doc's are usually referring to either SeHQ or Wiki (in this case we should have at least a detailed wiki on google code and refer to in from sehq)
[18:20:22] lukeis: and create a DesiredCapability ;)
[18:20:46] jleyba: the target audience for the wiki are other developers, the SeHQ target audience is any Se user

[18:50:09] deanclkclk: the deployed project is not on Jenkins

[22:16:31] *AutomatedTester goes to read the code
[22:17:22] ner0x: Anyone familiar with the Selenium::Server on cpan for perl?
[22:18:04] lukeis: AutomatedTester: what's the use case?
[22:18:24] AutomatedTester: I click something when i am in a known frame
[22:18:36] AutomatedTester: it launches a new frame but I dont know what it is
[22:18:45] AutomatedTester: if I do switch_to_default()
[22:18:52] AutomatedTester: what is considered default
[22:18:59] aivaturi: ner0x: it is just a wrapper for selenium-server-standalone
[22:19:04] lukeis: switch_to_default_content... switches you to window.top
[22:19:19] ner0x: aivaturi: You can't use it as a daemon though, as far as I can tell.
[22:19:45] aivaturi: no, it is designed to give you a programatic way of controlling the server 
[22:20:05] ner0x: aivaturi: So if I start it in a t/00init.t test I can't close it via t/99destroy.t test?
[22:20:09] AutomatedTester: :wiki jsonwireprotocol
[22:20:11] selbot2_: 1: 03JsonWireProtocol: A description of the protocol used by WebDriver to communicate with remote instances - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol
[22:21:02] aivaturi: ner0x: typically yes, unless you change the behavior of your unit tests
[22:21:37] *AutomatedTester wonders if active element will do it
[22:21:39] ner0x: aivaturi: I can, or cannot?
[22:21:52] ner0x: If I specify the port, etc.
[22:21:55] AutomatedTester: lukeis: the use case is FxOS
[22:22:34] aivaturi: ner0x: if you run init, then some tests & then destroy  - in that order then you'll be fine
[22:22:44] lukeis: so you want to switch to the new frame that gets created? why can't you locate it? (take a set of existing frames and switch to a new one?)
[22:22:49] lukeis: AutomatedTester: ^
[22:23:07] *AutomatedTester doesnt know why that hasnt been done
[22:23:15] ner0x: aivaturi: So when t/00init.t closes, it won't stop the server?
[22:23:17] AutomatedTester: just been asked my opinion
[22:23:33] AutomatedTester: click() leads to a new frame
[22:23:58] detroniz_: jimevans: seen that - will take care of it after I finish with PhantomJSDriver.java - so many little things to do, I need to keep to do it in order to avoid messing up :)
[22:24:04] detroniz_: jimevans: thanks btw
[22:24:11] jimevans: :)
[22:24:21] AutomatedTester: jimevans: whats missing for 2.26?
[22:24:29] AutomatedTester: do you still have the bacon?
[22:25:07] aivaturi: ner0x: it will - the script is written such a way that when the DESTROY is called, it will stop the server
[22:25:10] jimevans: i do. need test results on linux/windows for native/synthetic events for all firefoxen.
[22:25:16] aivaturi: & when init is done it will call DESTROY
[22:25:20] jarib: :ci status
[22:25:21] selbot2_: 0 building | 36 successful | 14 unstable | 0 failing | 1 aborted
[22:25:47] aivaturi: ner0x: if you don't want that behavior, modify the source & remove DESTROY method
[22:25:51] AutomatedTester: jimevans: do you know which Firefox versions have been done?
[22:26:13] aivaturi: ner0x: that way after t/init.t is done, the server will still stick around
[22:26:39] jimevans: i know windows firefox 15 and 16 for sure.
[22:26:54] jimevans: (native events)
[22:26:59] AutomatedTester: and we are good?
[22:27:01] jimevans: those are passing.
[22:27:07] AutomatedTester: ship it
[22:27:13] jimevans: LOLz
[22:27:21] ner0x: aivaturi: To be honest Daemon::Control might be a better way to do that, don't you think?
[22:27:35] AutomatedTester: jimevans: that is n and n-1
[22:27:42] jimevans: yes. correct.\
[22:27:51] jimevans: on windows.
[22:27:56] jimevans: haven
[22:28:23] ner0x: aivaturi: I'll mess around with it and see what works best.
[22:28:26] jimevans: haven't seen an updated native event prebuilt for linux, but i've been in and out of the office tgoday
[22:28:29] ner0x: aivaturi++ # thanks for the help
[22:29:09] aivaturi: ner0x: np

[22:49:51] detroniz_: jimevans: AutomatedTester: guys, I'm almost done with the patch to add PhantomJSDriver.java to the Selenium source code base. If I want to add the Wiki page about it, I'll need perms at some point.
[22:50:15] AutomatedTester: detroniz_: speak to Simon
[22:50:18] AutomatedTester: he has the keys
[22:51:16] jarib: detroniz_: the wiki is also in svn, so you can patch it just like the code for now.
[22:51:27] detroniz_: AutomatedTester: Oh! So the coffee bribe is going to be of use finally :)
[22:51:50] detroniz_: really? I have checked out only trunk, so I didn't see that
[22:52:29] AutomatedTester: detroniz_: we will have to make an exception for you getting access anyway
[22:52:52] jimevans: detronizator: yeah, it's not in trunk. it's in "wiki"
[22:53:26] detronizator: AutomatedTester: an "exception"? isn't a patch the norm around here?
[22:53:36] detronizator: I mean, except the few special SVN-bit people
[22:53:38] detronizator: ?
[22:54:23] AutomatedTester: i mean getting svn access
[22:54:43] AutomatedTester: we wouldnt have vetted a few of your patches
[22:55:04] AutomatedTester: :)
[22:55:11] AutomatedTester: its all good though

[23:59:45] detronizator: AutomatedTester: I know very well that you guys are "bored" of this kind of stuff. But I think this project is missing out. And I'm an "hard head", so it's difficult to stop repeating something I'm convinced about. If I had ever got a convincing explanation, I might have given up.
