[00:44:16] ajt: Hi everyone! I'm using the Firefox IDE to build out the a couple test cases. For some reason when I run the test it says it can not find a link (link=This_is_my_test_prescription) even tho it does exist. If I click the locate button in the IDE it highlights the element. I'm making a test case to make sure a prescription is properly added and then deleted. It'll click the add button, populate the form, submit the form, redirect back to the li
[00:44:33] ajt: Even if I run the exported test via PHPUnit I get the same error
[00:44:51] ajt: I've tried defining a css path and xpath to the element and it still says it can not find it

[15:44:00] davehunt: panshul: what version are you using? Firefox 16 should at least be supported by the addon

[15:44:28] davehunt: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/firefox-driver/extension/install.rdf#18

[16:36:35] llaskin: but it wouldn't be ideal for you
[16:36:38] barancev: dawagner: if I run with synthesized events "logspam" is same
[16:36:39] llaskin: i'd have 2 seperate drivers.
[16:36:50] lawcab: ok
[16:36:56] lawcab: so driver1 = new ffdriver 
[16:37:02] barancev: dawagner: but the browser doesn't fall dead
[16:37:06] lawcab: driver2 = new ffdriver
[16:37:19] llaskin: sure
[16:37:30] lawcab: then handle them as 2 separate objects
[16:37:38] lawcab: i will give that a try
[16:38:06] lawcab: thank you very much
[16:38:12] dawagner: My guess is none of those bits of logging are pointing at real problems, though eranm would be able to tell you better - I'll poke him this way
[16:38:41] dawagner: However I would suggest to santiycr that they make sure the missing shared libs be added regardless :)

[17:46:23] AutomatedTester: sigh...
[17:47:28] lukeis: maybe come 2013 he'll be around again ;)
[17:48:19] Dude-X_: AutomatedTester, any word when the ebook will be avialable
[17:48:24] Dude-X_: at Packt?
[17:48:43] AutomatedTester: Dude-X_: no...
[17:48:58] AutomatedTester: Dude-X_: can you forward me the email they sent you about 15 October?
[17:49:02] lukeis: srm: an element is also not displayed in selenium if it has no height nor width
[17:49:28] Dude-X_: it's not an email but when i check my order the website says ETA: October 15
[17:49:48] AutomatedTester: can you take a screenshot and forward to me
[17:51:41] Dude-X_: okay
[17:55:24] srm: lukeis: Thank you for the pointer, I saw that. I hope I'm not coming across these cases.
[17:55:47] lukeis: well, with a span that has no text, it likely has no height
[17:58:18] srm: lukeis: right, but I think that (in our specific scenario) my assertion that an Element which is in the DOM and has neither display=none nor visibility=hidden or collapse can be considered displayed. Hm...now that I think of, would they inherit the CSS value if a parent element is hidden?
[17:59:00] lukeis: yes they do
[17:59:50] lukeis: srm: this is relevant if you haven't seen it already http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6101461/selenium-2-0-element-is-not-currently-visible/6317358#6317358

[19:09:32] nirvdrum: All other versions 4+ seem unaffected.
[19:11:35] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: the next question is are we still supporting 3.6...
[19:12:00] nirvdrum: As far as I know, the policy is 3.6, ESR, latest, & previous.

[19:15:14] AutomatedTester: we have Googlers with commit bit so we can support it as long as they want to test it ;)
[19:15:21] jleyba: we're trying to replace 3.6 with ESR in our infrastructure here, but 3.6 is pretty entrenched :(
[19:16:40] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I can understand people wanting 3.6 still... there are old school Mozilla fans that think that is the old Mozilla and everything since is the new Mozilla

[20:10:53] santiycr: seems like a feature that sauce needs to have
[20:11:52] santiycr: when the browser crashes completely, I don't know what can be done from the sauce side to recover debugging information or to place the user in a place where info can be collected
[20:12:12] barancev: dawagner: can you help us with a good idea?
[20:12:20] santiycr: FWIW, I think the click is the command that causes the browser crash
[20:12:41] barancev: no, it's switchTo().window()

[21:37:28] detronizator: the other change list?
[21:37:43] jimevans: second thing, i've gone as far as i can with fixing up mouse events, i think. i've got 95% passing on the .net tests, but the remainder are in large part mouse event issues.
[21:38:55] detronizator: jimevans: I know - I have a bit to catch up on

[21:42:13] jimevans: ah right. got it.
[21:42:30] detronizator: but I can't argue there: is point on remaining "vanilla" is too valid
[21:45:09] lukeis: detronizator: I've been meaning to ask you, in the request handlers, would you be up for a change that converts all the if/else if's into a couple of objects {} and just does lookups in them? ... the huge if/else if structure makes me cringe ;)

[21:55:39] simonstewart: :)
[21:56:28] lukeis: window switching / alert handling are on my horizon <- the latter means abusing private API's ... so I want to make a branch for it... simonstewart how are we on git? ;) I'd rather do a git branch than an svn one
[21:56:48] simonstewart: krosenvold knows more about git than I do
[21:56:51] barancev: sticky mobile drivers -- whoever touches them becomes the owner :)
[21:56:58] simonstewart: But if we want to be in the App Store, we can't use private APIs
[21:57:03] lukeis: i know
[21:57:07] simonstewart: Sticky _code_
[21:57:13] lukeis: that's what I want a branch for alert handling
[21:57:19] lukeis: s/what/why/
[21:58:25] detronizator: lukeis: from a recent conversation with AutomatedTester, seems like there is no chance for a git selenium codebase. The one on github is just a 1-direction mirror.
[21:58:39] lukeis: i saw that discussion ;)
[21:59:07] lukeis: and it's a bit off... cause krosenvold is / was working on migrating the entire svn history into a git repo
[21:59:07] detronizator: the massive size of the repo and the multiple binaries in store would make for a git repo that is out of this worls :(
[21:59:41] detronizator: lukeis: I tried that. I couldn't even download the whole svn repo myself.
[21:59:52] detronizator: google code kept pushing me out

[22:01:26] lukeis: actually i don't think a new repo is milestone version worthy ;)
[22:02:06] *AutomatedTester wonders if this is all worthy since as we hit implementations we delete sections of our code base

[22:06:06] simonstewart: Oh… them...
[22:06:14] simonstewart: We don't like to talk about them
[22:06:27] detronizator: AutomatedTester: ;)
[22:06:33] barancev: who are those "we"?
[22:07:10] detronizator: simonstewart: does really the project need ALL the past history?
[22:07:25] simonstewart: IMO? Yes
[22:07:34] detronizator: and, wouldn't be doable to choose a milestone. a "3.0" maybe.
[22:07:35] simonstewart: I was just delving into it the other day
[22:07:43] detronizator: and from that point on, use another hosting and another repo?
[22:07:51] detronizator: I'm sure it's useful
[22:07:56] detronizator: I'm not saying "ditch it"
[22:08:06] detronizator: far from it
[22:08:08] simonstewart: The minute it's out of the main repo, it's gone
[22:08:24] detronizator: na'... taht's the grumpy man talking
[22:08:37] simonstewart: That's experience
[22:08:47] simonstewart: It sounds grumpy because a lot of things have gone wrong before
[22:08:58] detronizator: wow - you make my job too easy now. "It's experience"
[22:09:29] simonstewart: Next time we're drinking, I'll share some war stories with you :)
[22:09:38] detronizator: simonstewart: I TOTALLY agree that history is key - I find reason for my choices only thanks to the ability to see the past that a repo gives you.
[22:09:42] lukeis: simonstewart: i was waiting to ask this question... but seems answered. "Well, now that you're no longer a googler... does it *really* have to be googlecode?" ;)
[22:10:07] detronizator: lukeis: I'd doubt it's google code because he was a googler
[22:10:18] simonstewart: lukeis: yes. The same reasons still apply
[22:11:23] lukeis: detronizator: one could hope ;)
[22:11:37] detronizator: simonstewart: AutomatedTester: jimevans: and all the others main devs
[22:11:45] detronizator: you should really consider starting over the history of the repo
[22:11:50] detronizator: and use git
[22:12:08] detronizator: 3/4 years ago history can't be useful EVERY SINGLE day
[22:12:10] jimevans: detronizator: i've used both. i'm really agnostic about what version control system we use.
[22:12:17] lukeis: of course with moving to git, there's no reason to not have a sudo-official repo on github that we take pull requests from
[22:12:18] barancev: what's so important about repo?
[22:12:20] jimevans: i honestly don't care.
[22:12:32] simonstewart: detronizator: I know you like git
[22:12:43] simonstewart: I'd be more tempted my mercurial TBH
[22:13:03] simonstewart: It's just that if I move there, the swivel-eyed, foam-mouthed git fanboys won't stop moaning
[22:13:08] simonstewart: :P
[22:13:38] detronizator: simonstewart: yes - Git is the best. not because I think so. because "the vast majority" decided that
[22:13:42] detronizator: and it's not git alone
[22:13:47] detronizator: you need the tooling around it
[22:13:59] simonstewart: detronizator: "a million flies tell me that shit is the best there is"
[22:14:07] simonstewart: That's not an argument :)
[22:14:30] detronizator: simonstewart: it's true, a lot of times "majority is retarded"
[22:14:39] detronizator: for example, Romney is not far off Obama at the moment
[22:14:42] detronizator: BUT
[22:14:47] detronizator: it's not always like that
[22:14:50] *simonstewart weeps gently
[22:14:55] simonstewart: I think it is with git
[22:15:22] detronizator: just a remark: if you find a Mercurial Repo that has the same good tooling of GitHub, it's equally good to me than a "plain git"
[22:15:33] detronizator: the new BitBucket seems good for example
[22:15:40] detronizator: and it's even more "open"
[22:15:46] simonstewart: detronizator: we're not moving to github
[22:15:47] detronizator: and very large quota
[22:15:55] simonstewart: so don't conflate "source control" with "website"
[22:16:00] lukeis: keeping a branch up to date in svn is slightly harder than with git in my experience... svn merge is a pain to me ;)
[22:16:12] detronizator: yes, correct terminology: the website around it is key.
[22:16:34] simonstewart: We're sticking with Google Code
[22:16:41] *lukeis is ok with that
[22:16:44] detronizator: simonstewart: nowdays, ignoring how important the website around it is, is wrong.
[22:16:48] simonstewart: So base any choices on "we're sticking with google code"
[22:17:04] simonstewart: detronizator: the barrier to entry in our code base isn't the source control system
[22:17:11] detronizator: simonstewart: it's you.
[22:17:12] detronizator: :P
[22:17:13] lukeis: as I said... if it's git we can clone the heck out of it... so I can even have a clone on github ;)
[22:17:28] detronizator: lukeis: true ;)
[22:17:54] detronizator: and once ready with nice cool stuff coming from good githubber, submit it for review to the grumpuy bunch on google code :P
[22:17:54] simonstewart: Then we need to rope krosenvold into the conversation
[22:18:31] simonstewart: I've acquiesced  to the mistaken masses on the idea of moving to git. We're keeping the project history and we're keeping Google Code
[22:18:33] detronizator: (just hope no one gets offended for the grumpy jokes tonight)
[22:18:39] lukeis: :note krosenvold can we get some more traction on svn -> git ? :) some of us would appreciate it... please have a chat with the fine Mr. Stewart
[22:18:39] selbot2: ok!
[22:18:48] simonstewart: :)
[22:20:06] barancev: I love this man who confronts getting "new experience" aka new PITA! :)

[22:21:58] *lukeis is just happy that at work I'm moving from a team that uses perforce to a team using git :-D
[22:22:45] detronizator: lukeis: at Amazon (that I joined today) we (they) are migrating from svn to git too
[22:22:46] lukeis: p4 is not bad in its own (like svn)... but we have all these damned triggers on it now... that makes it slightly unbearable
[22:23:14] *barancev is accepting dawagner's advice and starting bisect
[22:23:29] lukeis: good luck ;)
[22:24:18] barancev: what was the first version that supported FF10?
[22:25:13] barancev: 2.19
[22:26:13] lukeis: barancev: i would go with 2.21 though... 2.19 was a bit buggy
[22:26:13] barancev: sauce runs 2.18 if you keep selenium version unspecified, browser version 10 and native events on, interesting

[22:26:44] simonstewart: My net connection is very flaky tonight
[22:26:48] simonstewart: I'm taking that as a hint
[22:26:50] simonstewart: G'night all
[22:26:54] lukeis: night
[22:27:04] detronizator: night
[22:27:13] simonstewart: I'll be grumpy in the direction of detronizator some other day :)
[22:27:13] simonstewart has left #selenium
[22:27:14] barancev: lukeis: I'm hunting bugs, nut looking for a stable version
[22:27:17] *detronizator is watching Revolution and thinking is quite bad
[22:27:20] lukeis: ah
[22:27:48] jleyba: detronizator: all the new shows suck this year
[22:27:52] barancev: and I need a basis for bisect
[22:28:16] lukeis: barancev: without native events 2.15 ;)
[22:28:47] barancev: bug is in native events
[22:29:06] lukeis: then 19 is your basis
[22:29:30] detronizator: :note simonstewart Young bright mind usually are grumpied out by new things. :P
[22:29:31] selbot2: ok!
[22:29:31] barancev: yes
[22:30:56] detronizator: jleyba: well, Game of Thrones has been ace the last 2 seasons and I expect the new to rule to
[22:30:59] detronizator: too*
[22:31:26] jleyba: that (and walking dead) are the exception to the rule :)
[22:33:18] detronizator: jleyba: this Revolution: reminds me so much of Lost that I'm concerned about watching it and being disappointed after 7 seasons
