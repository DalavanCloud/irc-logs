[00:58:03] jlamoree: I'm having Jenkins run an Ant build target that has a JUnit task, which runs a bunch of tests that ultimately connect to a Selenium Grid hub and drive browsers on nodes.
[00:59:48] jlamoree: What are most people doing to package the test files for upload?
[00:59:48] jlamoree: I could put it inside the jar as a resource, then save it out to a temp directory, then use sendKeys() push it to the node via JSON.
[00:59:48] jlamoree: But I suspect there's an easier way.
