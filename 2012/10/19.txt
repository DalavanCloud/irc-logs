[11:11:20] One-Man-Bucket: hello
[11:11:32] One-Man-Bucket: i'm having trouble with running getEval in a frames environment
[11:12:10] One-Man-Bucket: the script seems to run (i get OK in selenium server log), but nothing seem to happen in the browser
[11:12:18] One-Man-Bucket: it's selenium rc 2.25
[11:12:52] Gajanan has joined #selenium
[11:28:50] One-Man-Bucket: but it starts working after a while

[11:34:48] sburjan has joined #selenium
[11:38:54] rp2: timing problem?
[11:39:07] rp2: maybe your timeout is too soon?
[11:40:39] dekroning has joined #selenium
[11:41:04] rp2: my question: I'm trying to wrap my head around the PageObject and PageFactory objects as described in e.g. http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageFactory
[11:41:24] sburjan has joined #selenium
[11:41:43] One-Man-Bucket: i don't think so
[11:41:52] rp2: the modelling seems wrong to me.
[11:42:01] One-Man-Bucket: i'm stepping through the test, and stop at the eval 
[11:42:10] One-Man-Bucket: and i can run it a couple of times with no result, switch frames etc etc
[11:42:22] rp2: what do you mean by 'no result' ?
[11:42:23] One-Man-Bucket: i haven't been able to pinpoint exactly what makes it work again
[11:42:40] One-Man-Bucket: i run the eval, everything reports it as successful but nothing happen son the page
[11:42:41] rp2: are you using Selenium 1 or 2?
[11:42:46] One-Man-Bucket: 2.25
[11:42:50] rp2: are you using WebDriver?
[11:43:13] One-Man-Bucket: no
[11:43:24] One-Man-Bucket: hang on, now i found this in the firefox web console: [12:58:09.736] Exposing chrome JS objects to content without __exposedProps__ is insecure and deprecated. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XPConnect_wrappers for more information. @ http://localhost:8080/polopoly/script/polopoly-core.js:9761
[11:43:47] rp2: ooh
[11:44:24] One-Man-Bucket: i'm trying to be the office hero and bring our selenium test framwork up to date
[11:44:27] One-Man-Bucket: :)
[11:44:57] rp2: same for me, except that I'm trying to *introduce* Selenium, and I have little idea how to model things.
[11:45:10] One-Man-Bucket: it's still weird.. since the eval script *sometimes* work
[11:45:26] One-Man-Bucket: but it might be some odd stuff going on in our javascritp code then
[11:45:28] AutomatedTester: One-Man-Bucket: version of Firefox?
[11:45:35] One-Man-Bucket: AutomatedTester: 16.0.1
[11:46:13] AutomatedTester: One-Man-Bucket: try run your code in the web console or scratch pad of Firefox
[11:46:19] AutomatedTester: and see if it does what you expect
[11:46:27] One-Man-Bucket: if (typeof(eventdata['javaClass']) != "undefined" && typeof(eventdata['map']) != "undefined") {
[11:46:39] One-Man-Bucket: is the row that generates teh deprecated warning
[11:47:36] AutomatedTester: rp2: http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/tutorials/selenium/page-object-pattern.htm <- its old but might give you clues on how to set it up
[11:48:27] AutomatedTester: the PageObject stuff in the wiki you put just helps with taking the boiler plate away
[11:49:26] rp2: One-Man-Bucket: looks like the text from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XPConnect_wrappers#__exposedProps__ applies here
[11:50:02] barancev has joined #selenium
[11:50:38] rp2: if eventdata is the kind of object thei're talkign about there, you must use __exposedProps__ to provide access to its properties
[11:51:12] rp2: the error message suggests that javaClass is such a propery, and/or map
[11:51:14] One-Man-Bucket: rp2: yeah, but it seems we always get that warning
[11:51:23] One-Man-Bucket: even when the script works
[11:51:36] One-Man-Bucket: so it's probably not the underlying reason for our getEval problem
[11:51:44] rp2: but are you using __exposedPrope__ ?
[11:51:50] rp2: sorry about the typing errors
[11:54:19] rp2: AutomatedTester: thanks. the problem I have with these descriptions is that they are hardcoded to return a particular type of page object, when in reality, you don't know whether that type of object will be returned
[11:54:39] barancev: :log
[11:54:39] selbot2: http://illicitonion.com/selogs/selenium/2012/10/19.txt | http://illicitonion.com/selogs/search
[11:54:49] AutomatedTester: rp2: can you give me an example of what you mean?
[11:55:48] rp2: e.g. in your case, you're generating a SeleniumXPathTutorialÂ using the call to seleniumTutorials.ClickXpathTutorial()
[11:55:56] AutomatedTester: yea
[11:55:59] barancev: a question: why our PageObject implementation does not inject driver object?
[11:56:14] rp2: whereas in reality, the click may fail to return such an object
[11:56:53] barancev: kinda "if a class has a field of WebDriver type, the current driver object is assigned to this field"
[11:57:01] rp2: I suppose that can be regarded as a failure of the ClickXpathTutorial() method ... but the click worked
[11:57:21] AutomatedTester: a click will not fail to return an object, the click might fail but then you handle that in the PO that is returned
[11:57:28] AutomatedTester: since it should know the page its one
[11:57:38] AutomatedTester: s/one/on
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Oct 19 12:01:10 2012]
[12:01:10] barancev: would you mind if I implement driver injection to a page object?
[12:01:27] barancev: well, it's a question for the dev mail list
[12:02:03] AutomatedTester: barancev: the factory does the inject
[12:02:26] *AutomatedTester is tired so might be missing something :)
[12:03:25] barancev: undocumended feature?
[12:03:55] *barancev is looking through code
[12:04:52] barancev: which decorator does it?
[12:05:12] barancev: DefaultFieldDecorator does not
[12:05:23] AutomatedTester: FindBy
[12:05:45] *AutomatedTester has used it before
[12:06:01] barancev: FindBy injects elements, I'm talking about driver
[12:06:08] rp2: the problem is that the failure will happen at the wrong time
[12:06:39] AutomatedTester: rp2: so don't return until you know you are on the page
[12:06:49] AutomatedTester: if the click fails then raise
[12:06:52] skiphuffman has joined #selenium
[12:07:09] barancev: only WebElement and List<WebElement> fields are injectable atm
[12:07:45] rp2: AutomatedTester: yes but you will only know by calling that object's methods, right? 
[12:07:47] barancev: I want to implement injection for WebDriver fields
[12:07:54] AutomatedTester: rp2: yes
[12:08:06] rp2: so it's a catch-22 situation.
[12:08:17] barancev: otherwise, it's hard to add methods to a page object that need direct access to the driver
[12:09:17] barancev: like page.acceptAlert() that should do driver.switchTo().alert().accept()
[12:12:54] skiphuffman has left #selenium
[12:15:13] AutomatedTester: barancev: ahh I get you now
[12:15:20] AutomatedTester: barancev: sorry I am being really slow
[12:17:53] rp2: you return a FooPage with methods that represent actions available on FooPages, and *elsewhere* you'll need to put code to test whether the current page is a foo page so you can return a FooPage? that seems backwards to me
[12:18:41] rp2: alternatively, you don't put the tests there. this changes the meaning of the FooPage object to 'hypothesis that whatever we are looking at right now is a foo page'
[12:19:37] AutomatedTester: rp2: I would put the test that you are on the right page in FooPage
[12:19:48] rp2: but that creates a problem: once you start using its methjods and they fail because yiou're not really on a foo page, the blame will be put on those methods
[12:20:05] AutomatedTester: rp2: use the constructor to check you are on the page
[12:20:20] AutomatedTester: if you arent then throw
[12:20:29] rp2: unless you create a Page.IsWhatItSaysItIS() page method that you call in the Page constructor and inherit in FooPage
[12:20:38] rp2: yes
[12:21:14] rp2: is throwing a normal way to fail a test?
[12:22:18] AutomatedTester: in some cases yes
[12:22:40] AutomatedTester: there is little value in asserting you are on the page imho
[12:23:02] AutomatedTester: asserting elements on the page yes, being on the page no
[12:23:06] AutomatedTester: so if you arent throw
[12:23:16] rp2: why? I want to test that whebn I click Login, I will actually end up on the login page
[12:23:19] AutomatedTester: since then the dependencies you want havent been met
[12:24:15] AutomatedTester: rp2: so you are going to add assertTrue(amIOnThisPage())?
[12:24:42] rp2: no
[12:24:51] AutomatedTester: so then just throw
[12:24:58] rp2: the assertion should be in the constructor, shouldn't it?
[12:25:38] AutomatedTester: a conditional would be in the constructor
[12:25:45] AutomatedTester: not an assert statement
[12:26:16] rp2: conditional?
[12:26:36] AutomatedTester: so "if (!amIOnThisPage()) { throw new Exception("uh oh, wrong page"); }
[12:27:42] rp2: when I have a bar.GotoFoo() that generates a new FooPage() but it actually doesn't, that should be a failure of test code for the GotoFoo() method. I don't see how to achieve that
[12:28:26] davehunt has joined #selenium
[12:29:02] rp2: the FooPage.amIOnThisPage() method should run in that test
[12:29:51] rp2: so that is why this model confuses me
[12:38:51] rp2: amIOnThisPage() would need something like if(calledFromATest()) { assert(iReallyAmThisKindOfPage(); )
[12:39:14] rp2: i mean the constructor for every page object would need it
[12:39:41] sburjan has joined #selenium
[12:40:02] rp2: that will make it clean: the test will run exactly whenever you are really testing a transition to such a page

A page I am testing creates dynamic content. If I run the FirefoxDriver the content is generated correctly. If I run the HtmlUnitDriver, these content changes don't seem to occur.

[13:11:03] milligan: How can I prevent selenium from spewing out info and warnings about javascript and css errors?
[13:12:19] milligan: nvm
[13:14:54] milligan: zac_sel, the element I am after is indeed generated by javascript. Should selenium handle it when I have javascript enabled?
[13:21:14] ignacio_ has joined #selenium
[13:21:40] rp2: AutomatedTester: am I imagining a problem that doesn't exist, or is there opportunity for improvement here?
[13:22:17] AutomatedTester: rp2: imho... its not a problem I would worry about
[13:22:30] rp2: ok
[13:22:45] rp2: that's me ... always worrying about the things I don't know how to do
[13:22:59] AutomatedTester: :)
[13:23:30] rp2: it';s because I can't think of how to circumvent the problem
[13:24:05] barancev has joined #selenium
[13:25:10] AutomatedTester: rp2: the way I would do it, and I know many others would, is to throw an exception if you arent on the page
[13:25:51] AutomatedTester: the test runner will mark it as a failure because there is an unhandled exception
[13:26:03] rp2: then how would you write a test to see whether you arrive on the right kind of page?
[13:26:04] AutomatedTester: and thats all that matters
[13:26:11] rp2: ok
[13:26:21] AutomatedTester: rp2: because you would try use the functionality on the page
[13:26:48] AutomatedTester: so if you go to a login page and it doesnt load, typing into the username/password fields would fail
[13:27:00] rp2: it seems to me that this would lead to messy testing code
[13:27:13] AutomatedTester: what would be messy
[13:27:51] rp2: yes, so you sort of happen to combine goign to the page and trying to log in, and when the login fails, all you know is somethign failed, it might be a failure to arrive on the login page in the first place
[13:28:11] zunino has joined #selenium
[13:28:15] jimevans has joined #selenium
[13:28:22] AutomatedTester: rp2: but thats where you put things in place to see the issue
[13:28:32] AutomatedTester: e.g. take screenshots on failure
[13:28:33] rp2: I'm trying to imagine how to factor it out properly. because there are two actions, one a precondition for the other, so they should be two dependent tests
[13:28:50] rp2: the tests can be structured like a state machine
[13:28:57] llaskin has joined #selenium
[13:29:17] rp2: when the test code is structured like that as well youi can properly factor things out and write all tests in a single place
[13:29:32] Zunino: Good morning. Is there anybody who could assist me with an Ajax-related question?
[13:30:02] AutomatedTester: Zunino: :ask
[13:30:02] selbot2: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)

[13:30:11] cmcgraw has joined #selenium
[13:30:12] AutomatedTester: thats how we structure our tests
[13:30:14] rp2: one idea is to introduce a @Requires annotation. when a method has it, and you're trying to create the object within a test, the method will be run and when it fails the constructor will assert test failure
[13:30:22] AutomatedTester: we do python
[13:30:33] SamuraiJack has joined #selenium
[13:31:06] AutomatedTester: so the tests are succinct
[13:31:45] rp2: yes, but they could be more succinct
[13:31:54] Zunino: Scenario: a test page with a simple form, containing 2 input fields. Altering the 1st one results in an Ajax call which changes the 2nd field's value in the callback.
[13:32:07] AutomatedTester: rp2: they could but then the value disappears very quickly imho
[13:32:10] Zunino: The problem is I'm dealing with JSF
[13:32:23] rp2: I mean you have to do things explicitly that could be factored out with a different API
[13:32:55] Zunino: And when the 2nd field is to be "refreshed", JSF actually replaces the DOM node with a new one with the same ID.
[13:33:07] AutomatedTester: rp2: there is a point you have to worry that you dont over-engineer it
[13:33:28] Zunino: So in my test I thought about waiting until the value of the 2nd field had changed from its original value.
[13:33:37] Zunino: Here's what I tried...
[13:33:38] rp2: e.g. on line 27-28 you create a personas_page and then test whether you really have one. because you have to do both, you might forget - it would be better if this was automated
[13:33:47] rp2: good point

[13:35:43] AutomatedTester: Zunino: its all good :)
[13:35:48] rp2: Zunino: why is the outer Wait necessary?
[13:37:13] rp2: String salario = driver.findElement(By.id("j_idt86-salario_input")).getAttribute("value"); will already wait for the element, right?
[13:37:52] Zunino: https://raw.github.com/gist/3918091/50f46a60b34e094c84a6914031048b5731e581e9/webdriverwait-value-change
[13:38:03] cgoldberg has joined #selenium
[13:38:26] rp2: does this somehow keep polling until the element has the right value?
[13:38:59] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[13:39:42] Zunino: The problem is that I can't be sure exactly when JSF will do its thing and replace the original DOM node.
[13:39:50] rp2: ah ok
[13:40:08] Zunino: So I'm afraid findElement will return right away, since the element will be there "most of the time".
[13:40:27] Zunino: Anyway, let me try and see what happens.
[13:40:35] rp2: it shouldn't, but it would return if the element is found and has the wrong value
[13:40:57] rp2: so if JSF will *replace* the value the outer Wait makes sense
[13:41:04] rp2: but don't trust me I'm a newbie
[13:43:50] Zunino: I just tried relying on findElement directly but, as I suspected, it doesn't work, because the call finds the original node (before it is replaced).
[13:44:18] Zunino: The thing is JSF will not simply update the /value/ attribute; it will actually fully replace the node.
[13:44:51] Zunino: The replacement node looks the same (same id and other attributes), but with the updated value (the one I care about for my test).
[13:45:33] Zunino: My strategy was to keep a record of the original value for that field and use a WebDriverWait to hold until the value of the field has changed.
[13:46:19] Zunino: In order to make sure I'm basing my condition on the right node (the replacement one), I use findElement again at each iteration.
[13:46:35] Zunino: I'm not sure I've been able to make the situation clear.
[13:46:40] milligan: Will .click() work for an element that has no obvious action? (I am trying to click a jQuery tab)
[13:46:56] llaskin: Zunino: i don't know if I would do that as part of the waiter...

[14:08:18] milligan: Anyone? Can the HtmlUnitDriver click a jquery tab and get the new dom that gets generated?
[14:09:30] jimevans: milligan: i don't trust HtmlUnit's javascript implementation enough to answer that question with an unqualified "yes"
[14:09:49] jimevans: but that would be an HtmlUnit problem, not specifically with the driver.
[14:10:26] milligan: jimevans, Any hinters to what I might doing wrong when the .click() method of the element doesn't appear to generate the new DOM? (at least my wait.until doesn't detect a new, expected element)
[14:10:33] jimevans: and that's also just my opinion too. i don't use HtmlUnit.
[14:10:44] llaskin: zunino do you have a snippet of your code laying around?  
[14:11:00] llaskin: some of the html you are looking at + the code you are using to look at it preferrably in a :gist
[14:11:00] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[14:11:01] AutomatedTester: milligan: if you have set the javascript flag and it doesnt work then its probably not working in htmlunit
[14:14:47] milligan: AutomatedTester, is a form to be considered an "Element" ? i.e for findElement(By.id(... ?
[14:18:02] AutomatedTester: milligan: anything in the DOM is an element
[14:18:07] Zunino: llaskin: https://raw.github.com/gist/3918091/50f46a60b34e094c84a6914031048b5731e581e9/webdriverwait-value-change
[14:18:26] llaskin: right
[14:19:16] Zunino: In summary, the problem is that the tests needs to assess the value of a given element after some Ajax event has taken place.
[14:19:17] raphaelt has left #selenium
[14:19:39] Zunino: With the twist that JSF will remove and reinsert the DOM node in the tree.
[14:19:50] llaskin: Zunino, what I would do is effectively the following:  1) get the value of field 2,      2) update field 1,   3) wait for the 2nd fields value to != the value from (1)  4) continue. 
[14:20:13] Zunino: llaskin: Exactly!
[14:20:24] Zunino: That's what I'm trying to achieve with that snippet.
[14:20:32] Zunino: Of course, I might be doing it wrong.

[14:43:40] bfife: things that they are putting into user-extensions.js which would only work with RC
[14:43:50] jimevans: ah, right. smart client relies heavily on user-extensions.
[14:43:54] bfife: yep
[14:44:18] jimevans: nope. the smartclient guys need to update their library to use webdriver.
[14:45:04] farlan has joined #selenium

[15:07:50] bfife: which now that i think about it, probably isn't terrible.
[15:10:40] bfife: instead of relying on user-extensions though, what's the proper way to hook into webdriver? roll your own?

[15:33:32] Gx4: System.TimeoutException: Timed out after 30 second, metod id: "btn_continue"
[15:35:26] Gx4: or does WebDriverWait doesn't care if it's surrounded by try catch ?
[15:37:50] jimevans: Gx4: i didn't realize you were using a webdriverwait. if the wait times out, you won't get NoSuchElementException, you'll get a TimeoutException. you need to catch that.
[15:39:06] Gx4: ok
[15:39:15] Bebe_sel has joined #selenium
[15:39:42] Gx4: I've just write catch (NoSuchElementException) { } catch (TimeoutException) { } right ?
[15:40:16] jimevans: Gx4: right, but you might want to rethink your approach. if you're explicitly waiting for an element (which you are, if you're using WebDriverWait), do you really want to just continue on if the element isn't there?
[15:40:50] Gx4: yes, because the element may be or may be not present
[15:40:56] teodosia_sel has left #selenium
[15:41:09] jimevans: 30 seconds is a long time to wait.
[15:41:35] jimevans: and it sounds like something you should know what to expect.
[15:42:40] Gx4: well the idea is I upload a file and on some files it shows errors and asks you if you want to continue, on others it goes straight to other screen
[15:43:02] Gx4: so the try is to click button continue if it is present
[15:44:21] jimevans: Gx4: you're trying to do to much with one method, in my opinion. you should know what to expect based on what files you're trying to upload. that way, you specifically know whether the button should be present or not.
[15:44:21] Gx4: but catch exceptions worked on both cases with and without extra button
[15:44:52] jimevans: it'll work, but i'd never design my code that way.
[15:47:18] Gx4: it works now like this Test says to API create file, then I call file.Save();  it goes to API and calls Screen Upload<File>(Path) which does what it's told
[15:47:32] testingb0t1 has joined #selenium
[15:48:31] Gx4: it's like var uploadScreen = Main.GoToUpload();  uploadScreen.UploadFile<File>(Path)

[15:49:11] nhirata has joined #selenium
[15:49:21] jimevans: Gx4: i hear you, but you're pushing too much functionality into that method, imo.
[15:50:31] Gx4: I'm not worried as long as the method is ~20 lines
[15:50:38] jimevans: at the very least, you need another parameter to tell the UploadFile method whether the upload will result in an error or not. but again, it's your code.
[15:51:28] Gx4: it's not an error it's more of a warning
[15:52:22] jimevans: doesn't matter. you have one behavior for one type of file, another for another type of file. your method should know what to expect, rather than trying to guess based on the page result.
[15:53:05] Gx4: I hope testing becomes something AI can do on it's own :D
[15:53:05] jimevans: don't force your test code to guess what should happen. tell it what to expect.
[15:53:35] Gx4: in this case I'm interested in the end result if file is uploaded or not
[15:53:55] jimevans: it'd be cheaper to analyze the file ahead of time to know if it'll be successfully uploaded, then.
[15:54:08] jimevans: s/cheaper/cheaper and more reliable/
[15:54:56] Gx4: the files are working fine, but the system may crash on some particular type so the test would tell me that
[15:55:15] Gx4: i.e. which type has stopped working
[15:55:24] llaskin: jimevans: is he talking about using t he file upload dialog?(sorry walked ina  bit late)
[15:55:33] llaskin: which is not supported since its not in the dom...
[15:55:35] jimevans: llaskin: it's more about code design.
[15:56:02] Gx4: i'll be more specific it's banner types
[15:56:07] Gx4: i.e. image/ flash
[15:56:21] Gx4: and while image may work and be uploaded
[15:57:00] Gx4: flash is uploaded through same page, but procedures are different and it may fail to show up in UI after being uploaded
[15:57:35] Gx4: this clever skip with try catch shouldn't affect those parts of system
[15:58:12] Gx4: but thanks for the tip :) I know that methods should do one thing only
[15:58:42] jimevans: Gx4: so, to my point, you can determine a priori, "am i uploading an image or a flash file?" and branch accordingly. if, at some point, the system fails to work with the same workflow on a specific type of file, you know you have a bug in the system, or that your workflow has changed.
[15:59:47] Gx4: the tests are different but they both use same upload screen, that is why they're both using same Screen class and same method Upload

[16:05:23] dawagner has joined #selenium
