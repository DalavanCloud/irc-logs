[00:18:46] detronizator: jimevans: hey
[00:18:48] detronizator: u still here?
[00:19:04] llaskin: anything i can do ya for?
[00:20:03] detronizator: llaskin: me?
[00:21:34] jimevans: detronizator: hey
[00:21:55] detronizator: jimevans: I see what you say - you are right, definitely not handled yet
[00:22:01] detronizator: but it could be easily fixable
[00:22:14] jimevans: okay. i'll take your word for it.
[00:22:14] detronizator: if the submit is changed and "wrapped" in the execFuncAndWaitForLoad
[00:22:24] jimevans: ah. i see what you're getting at.
[00:22:25] detronizator: the submit "expects" a load
[00:22:36] detronizator: worst case, I handle it with a timeout
[00:22:53] jimevans: that sounds appropriate.
[00:23:01] detronizator: the other approach would be to monitor for bubbling events on the body: too convoluted.
[00:23:07] jimevans: agreed.
[00:23:29] detronizator: I'll file an issue, unless you were going to
[00:23:37] jimevans: no, go ahead.
[00:24:02] jimevans: i think you can see how i spent my weekend. :)
[00:24:38] detronizator: yes
[00:24:59] detronizator: and good news: my bride-to-be is "leaving me for a week alone"
[00:25:10] detronizator: I know how I'm going to spend my "lonely time"
[00:25:11] jimevans: oooh. hack time!
[00:25:26] detronizator: hack? more like "finish that bloody ghostdriver before people kill me"
[00:25:31] detronizator: you in particular :)
[00:25:32] jimevans: :)
[00:25:55] detronizator: jimevans: ah - did you find today the Patch I'm waiting for merge? the PhantomJSDriver binding?
[00:26:01] detronizator: I'd love to tick that out of my todo list
[00:26:15] jimevans: i did. i really want to get 2.26 released before i merge it in though.
[00:26:20] jimevans: sigh.
[00:26:21] detronizator: kool
[00:26:43] detronizator: I predicted it would never make it for 2.26
[00:26:52] detronizator: give priority to 2.26, no worries.
[00:26:58] jimevans: about that native keys pull request. i'm sure i missed something there, so when you get a chance to look it over, i'd appreciate you doing so with some care.
[00:27:11] detronizator: I will
[00:27:19] detronizator: you added quite a bit of stuff
[00:28:13] jimevans: it's a big change. i was trying to get the interactions tests working. mostly did, too.
[00:28:43] jimevans: we still have the async javascript execution crash, right?
[00:28:59] jimevans: (i disabled those tests for now)
[00:29:23] detronizator: yes
[00:29:30] detronizator: that is phantomjs
[00:30:12] detronizator: it's nothing we do: phantomjs crashes and I have had for long the feeling that something is fishy around the area of changes that were done to "accomodate" the Google Crashing stuff
[00:30:22] detronizator: honest: never spent time understadning that thing
[00:30:48] detronizator: I'm not sure anyone actually takes the bug reports with "dumps attached" and analyses them
[00:30:56] detronizator: I feel it was added "because it's cool"
[00:31:02] detronizator: not because we know how to use it
[00:31:24] detronizator: and in such cases, I'm a fund of old-style debugger + printfs
[00:31:25] detronizator: never failed me
[00:31:44] jimevans: well, just to give you a status update on the .NET integration tests. the alerts tests and the 'executing async javascript' tests are disabled. with my native events fix and the file upload hack, the tests pass at 98%.
[00:33:51] detronizator: ah
[00:33:54] detronizator: the file upload hack
[00:34:00] detronizator: got a question about that, if you got time
[00:34:07] detronizator: I want to clarify my head jimevans
[00:34:12] jimevans: sure. go ahead.
[00:34:48] detronizator: so, the way WebDrivers tend to work, is to fill the file upload field as a "input type=text" kind of element
[00:35:08] detronizator: the local path to the file is written in the text box, that happens to be input type=file
[00:35:13] detronizator: am I right?
[00:35:53] jimevans: sort of. browsers have started to not allow that to work anymore, rendering the text box portion of the file upload control as disabled, so it can't be typed into.
[00:36:29] detronizator: k
[00:36:37] detronizator: so, what you guys do within the client side
[00:36:43] detronizator: is to "intercept" on "sendKeys"
[00:36:49] detronizator: and if a path is detected
[00:36:59] jimevans: i can tell you how IE does it. it fires off a different thread, and executes a javascript click on the element in that thread. that thread blocks, and we look for the file dialog and fill it in by sending keystrokes to it.
[00:37:16] detronizator: k
[00:37:29] detronizator: so that's what you are trying to do with phantomjs too
[00:37:41] detronizator: the difference is that phantomjs requires you to "pre-type" the path
[00:37:44] detronizator: in a temporary var
[00:37:51] detronizator: that is picked up once you just click on the item
[00:37:56] jimevans: not really. i'm just trying to use phantomjs's upload file feature.
[00:38:15] detronizator: and that's how it works internally
[00:38:45] detronizator: so, the think to do
[00:38:47] jimevans: i'll take your word on that.
[00:39:15] detronizator: so, if everything is clear in my head (and I have had a bourbon, so I might be slightly drunk :))
[00:39:26] jimevans: :D
[00:39:34] detronizator: we need to "pre-type" the path (and you do that already)
[00:39:48] detronizator: than click on the input type=file
[00:40:00] detronizator: the phantomjs code that is ALREADY in place will do the rest
[00:40:12] davehunt has joined #selenium
[00:40:18] detronizator: the api for file upload at the moment requires you to pass both Element to click + path
[00:40:34] detronizator: I can make an API that DOESN'T require the element to click
[00:40:44] detronizator: but than leaves to the developer to click on the element
[00:40:49] detronizator: you follow me?
[00:40:55] detronizator: or have I lost both of us :)
[00:41:51] jimevans: well, to be completely accurate, the current api requires a css selector that selects a file element, but yes, that's it essentially. if you can create a phantomjs api that lets us get around that without needing to specify the element, we're golden.
[00:42:31] detronizator: than, unless the bourbon was too high on alchool (and I don't think there is such a thing)
[00:42:34] jimevans: my idea was to get the element out of the cache, and pass it into a new uploadFile() api that would take the element itself, but i think your approach would be cleaner.
[00:42:40] detronizator: we might have a solution approach
[00:43:00] detronizator: Taking elements OUT of the page is a problem
[00:43:10] detronizator: the pointer to it are resolvable only within the page itself
[00:43:28] jimevans: as you say.
[00:43:30] detronizator: so, it "might" work, but we might also just hit a QtWebKit barrier: I haven't tried
[00:43:51] jimevans: i think you're probably right.
[00:44:10] detronizator: avoiding the whole thing might be better: ultimately we just need the path to be "ready to be typed" once the "File Selector Popup window" is invoked by WebKit
[00:44:42] detronizator: tomorrow I'll wake up and I'll remember nothing of this
[00:44:49] detronizator: I'd better write it in the issue :)
[00:44:56] jimevans: good idea. :)
[00:46:38] jimevans: incidentally, when i was playing about with the file upload stuff originally, i tried to get it done by mimicking what phantomjs's uploadFile() method did, but i was unsuccessful.
[00:46:39] detronizator: done
[00:46:54] detronizator: mmm
[00:47:14] detronizator: as I said: I might be just drunk and this idea has a major flaw that I totally miss now :)
[00:47:15] jimevans: the reason, i think, is because inside that element it calls .evaluateJavaScript() on the QWebElement located by the css selector.
[00:47:44] detronizator: and it was failing on that, right?
[00:47:46] jimevans: i don't know what that does, unless it mucks about with the 'this' pointer.
[00:48:00] jimevans: not so much failing as just not working.
[00:48:31] detronizator: simply, when you do a "page.evaluate("function(){ return document.querySelector('#id'); })"
[00:48:36] detronizator: you are NOT getting an element
[00:48:41] detronizator: you are getting something weird
[00:48:47] jimevans: oh, no, that i know.
[00:48:48] detronizator: a pointer to something that you can't use anymore
[00:49:18] jimevans: when i was trying it, i was trying to call the javascript that phantomjs calls, but that wasn't working.
[00:49:29] jimevans: again, i suspect because the "this" object wasn't what i expected it to be.
[00:49:35] jimevans: s/expected/needed/
[00:49:46] jimevans: but i really don't know for certain.
[00:49:59] detronizator: y - but I think expected is the right word: QtWebKit is definitely NOT designed for what we made it do
[00:50:15] detronizator: we have went well beyond his design purposes
[00:50:26] detronizator: I think when/if we go on Qt5 
[00:50:30] detronizator: that will be PhantomJS 2.0
[00:50:35] jimevans: right.
[00:50:43] detronizator: and that should carry the new JS engine
[00:50:45] detronizator: based on V8
[00:50:52] detronizator: and with a binding that can do MUCH more
[00:51:12] detronizator: now... it's time to go for me
[00:51:14] jimevans: yep. anyway, it's late.
[00:51:19] detronizator: yes
[00:51:20] jimevans: go to bed. i'm going home.
[00:51:25] detronizator: ;)
[00:51:29] detronizator: talk you soon
[00:51:32] jimevans: later.\

[04:11:47] santiycr: ner0x:  use the latest here: https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list
[04:11:57] santiycr: with the latest chrome
[04:12:22] santiycr: though generally it's not a huge deal if you keep using an old version for a while
[04:13:48] ner0x: santiycr: For some reason chrome won't work.
[04:14:00] ner0x: santiycr: Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: proxy must be of type dictionary, not null. Received: null
[04:15:01] santiycr: chrome and chromedriver are mainly compatible one or two versions 
[04:15:11] santiycr: oh, you using perl?
[04:15:24] ner0x: santiycr: Yes.
[04:15:28] santiycr: perl sets the proxy setting == null by default 
[04:15:32] santiycr: which chrome doesn't like
[04:15:53] ner0x: I can override it no problem, if you can tell me what the correct default settings are.
[04:16:17] santiycr: set it to an empty map
[04:16:27] santiycr: or even better, just remove it from the desired capabilities being sent
[04:16:27] ner0x: {} ?
[04:16:30] santiycr: yeah
[04:16:46] santiycr: if it's not included in the hash sent to selenium, it should be just fine
[04:17:16] ner0x: I think Selenium::Remote::Driver automatically includes it.
[04:17:27] santiycr: yeah, that's kind of a bug
[04:17:36] santiycr: I know an old version of chromedriver just dealt with it fine
[04:17:48] santiycr: though recently it started failing on it
[04:18:12] ner0x: proxy => { proxyType => 'direct' } makes it work.
[04:18:19] santiycr: at Sauce Labs we drop it (if null) before passing the request to chromedriver
[04:18:22] ner0x: proxy => {} also fails
[04:18:27] santiycr: oh, interesting
[04:18:42] santiycr: would you mind reporting it to the perl selenium bindings? 
[04:19:41] ner0x: santiycr: I'll just patch the module to set it to that by default. I can't hurt anything.
[04:19:52] santiycr: yeah, for sure :)
[04:19:54] ner0x: s/I/It*
[04:20:12] santiycr: that's better than an error causing value
[04:20:19] ner0x: Correct.
[04:20:30] ner0x: You know there is Test::WWW::Selenium as well right?
[04:20:34] santiycr: actually, thinking about it twice, not setting it at all, let's selenium figure out what's best
[04:20:35] ner0x: Not entirely sure why it gets no love.
[04:20:48] santiycr: which is a more maintainable option long term
[04:21:06] ner0x: Test::WWW::Selenium is definitely more used.
[04:21:23] santiycr: yeah, the perl community hasn't caught up much on the automated testing bandwagon 
[04:21:33] santiycr: at least not that I've seen
[04:21:35] ner0x: santiycr: False.
[04:21:36] santiycr: alright! Time to run, 8:30pm here
[04:21:44] santiycr: ner0x: hm interesting
[04:21:55] ner0x: santiycr: Automated testing is beaten into our heads, actually.
[04:22:21] ner0x: santiycr: We just don't have many bindings for popular resources unless we make them ourselves. :)

[04:27:35] santiycr: ner0x:  alright, this is the perfect queue to recruit you into becoming the official maintainer of the perl client bindings 
[04:27:47] santiycr: though sadly, really gotta drop
[04:27:56] santiycr: food for thought! ;)

[08:06:25] andreastt: :note AutomatedTester Did you see webdriverplus.org?

[08:11:48] Nari: Oh, update on my problem - I lost cookies because of the reinstantiation. Any neat way to close and open?
[08:13:14] jazz_: anyone around who knows how to load firefox with a profile settings in webdriver.js?
[08:16:33] andreastt: jazz_: In theory it should just be a matter of encoding the profile as a base 64 string and assign it to the "firefox_profile" capability.
[08:16:55] andreastt: I don't know about the JS binding, but most other bindings have utilities to make this slightly easier.
[08:17:42] Ardesco has joined #selenium
[08:18:23] jazz_: ok, thanks! I will try that
[08:19:33] andreastt: This would be the Java alternative:
[08:19:35] andreastt: FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile();
[08:19:35] andreastt: DesiredCapabilities caps = DesiredCapabilities.Firefox();
[08:19:35] andreastt: caps.SetCapability("firefox_profile", profile.ToBase64String());
[08:19:36] andreastt: IWebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(caps);
[08:19:56] andreastt: Actually that's C#, fetched from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6048276/how-to-set-firefox-profile-using-remotewebdriver-net.  But pretty much the same in Java.

[15:00:11] barancev: jimevans: actually, I don't know what to do about 2.26 in this situation
[15:00:26] barancev: I'd suggest to run tests for native events locally (as many browsers as possible)
[15:00:49] barancev: and use CI results for synthetic events only
[15:00:52] jimevans: barancev: but isn't the problem in the remote case for firefox? that reproduces locally too, right?
[15:01:28] Thelas: jimevans: Oh, that's what you meant by css selector. Apparently I need to actually be awake to code.  The only attribute the tag has is style, will [style=color:red;font-weight:bold] even work?
[15:01:37] barancev: jimevans: yes, on a linux VM when I run tests with RemoteWebDriver
[15:01:52] jimevans: i'm thinking it's pretty much a blocking bug. we can't release with a crash when you switch windows if you happen to be using RemoteWebDriver.

[15:05:46] CarlJokl: Hello, it sounds like you are already in a fairly involved discussion
[15:05:58] barancev: here is a piece of code eranm added that allowed to set native events: if (key == 'nativeEvents') {
[15:05:59] barancev: 231    +            driver.enableNativeEvents = value;
[15:05:59] barancev: 232    +          }
[15:06:25] jimevans: CarlJokl: just go ahead and speak up. :)
[15:06:28] barancev: and this code causes crashes
[15:06:59] barancev: before this commit native evnts were off, always
[15:07:22] barancev: so now again I don't know what is the real root cause of the crashes
[15:07:37] barancev: and no idea how to fix it other than set native events off again
[15:07:45] CarlJokl: I am a QA automation engineer / Developer in Test at Electronic Arts
[15:07:57] jimevans: barancev: i get that. what we really need is someone with intimate knowledge of how the native events code is *supposed* to work on linux, and to get in here and fix it. and those people have been otherwise occupied apparently.
[15:08:16] CarlJokl: I have been working with some initial prototyping using the Android remote control web driver.
[15:08:22] barancev: jimevans: agree
[15:08:31] llaskin: CarlJokl: how do you like working for EA?
[15:08:39] CarlJokl: A little over 6 months
[15:09:07] CarlJokl: This is my first time in a QA automation role. All my previous work has been core development
[15:09:11] CarlJokl: Anyway
[15:09:54] CarlJokl: I was having some issues using the Android driver. I wondered if actually getting involved in the project would help. Looking up information about that brought me to this IRC chat
[15:10:47] jimevans: CarlJokl: getting involved in the project is a Good Thing™.
[15:11:14] CarlJokl: I don't know what is involved. Does this involve signing a contributor agreement?
[15:11:19] jimevans: and the android components could use some love.
[15:11:27] jimevans: CarlJokl: yep. :cla
[15:11:28] selbot2: http://goo.gl/qC50R
[15:11:31] jimevans: that one.
[15:12:05] jimevans: then check out the code, make your changes, and submit a patch.
[15:12:13] jimevans: we use subversion as our version control system.
[15:12:29] jimevans: people with the commit bit will review the patch, and apply it for you.
[15:13:07] jimevans: i don't personally touch the android driver code, but there are some who do (none of them in the channel at the moment, i don't think)
[15:15:58] CarlJokl: For the sake of the form. Is it better to use my private email or work email? I joined the Google group with one of my work email addresses.
[15:15:59] Dave_B: Thelas: If you're still around... you could always do something like 'driver.find_element_by_css_selector("body").text' if you only care about the text being present somewhere, not interested in where. Not lovely, but might get the result you want
[15:16:17] Thelas: Oh, that'd make sense. Thanks.

[15:41:32] Nari: hello
[15:42:47] Nari: I come with a question on reopening browsers and how that affects cookies, can anyone indulge me? :)
[15:43:03] jimevans: Nari: :ask
[15:43:03] selbot2: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[15:44:46] Nari: okay, got that! I want to close and reopen a browser without instantiating it again
[15:44:48] Bebe_sel has joined #selenium
[15:45:33] jimevans: Nari: that seems counterintuitive.
[15:46:16] jimevans: can you rephrase that another way?
[15:47:01] Nari: Ok, I just want to hold on to the persistent cookies without passing around profiles
[15:47:32] Nari: I ran some tests on IE, firefox and chrome and IE for some reason, didn't lose the cookies on reinstantiating WebDriver
[15:48:00] jimevans: Nari: that's because the IE driver is really, really dumb with respect to cookies.
[15:48:30] jimevans: IE has no concept of a "profile" other than the global one used by the currently-logged-in user.
[15:48:31] Nari: to rephrase, I just want to simulate how a user would close and re-open a browser to go back to the same site to find only some of his settings saved
[15:49:03] jimevans: so IE behaves like you want it to, but firefox and chrome don't, mainly because they start with a clean profile each time.
[15:49:31] Nari: correct, I arrived at the same conclusion, but my next task would be to find the most elegant solution to that
[15:49:35] jimevans: would the cookies API work for you?
[15:50:43] Nari: Can't I preserve a profile reference instead?
[15:50:44] jimevans: there are methods off of driver.manage() in java (or the equivalent in other languages.
[15:51:13] jimevans: i thought you didn't want to pass around profiles.
[15:51:31] jimevans: no, you can't retain the *same* profile between instances of a browser.
[15:51:37] Nari: Ah!
[15:51:46] jimevans: firefox in particular will copy the profile that you specify.
[15:51:50] Nari: well, I would rather preserve a profile than play around with cookies
[15:51:59] Nari: for firefox, I could try using the default profile
[15:52:10] jimevans: the reason for that is to consider the case where you want to run multiple instances of the browser running different tests.
[15:52:31] jimevans: if both are pointing to the *same* profile, rather than a copy, you run the risk of them stepping on each other.
[15:54:22] jimevans: so your options are to keep a template profile around which already has the cookies you're interested in (which probably defeats the purpose), or use the cookie manipulation functions.
[15:55:05] stephend has joined #selenium
[15:55:38] jimevans: your code may not be running multiple browser instances, so you may not care that each instance has to have its own profile, but the library can't be so blasé about it.
[15:55:43] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[15:56:46] Nari: I would use the cookie manipulation api, but the last time I used it, it ended up creating a duplicate cookie
[15:57:06] jimevans: that sounds suboptimal
[15:57:07] Nari: the only difference between the two cookies was a dot in front of the domain name
[15:59:03] jimevans: Nari: then that's a standard vs. a non-standard cookie.
[15:59:33] Nari: I should research that

[17:17:19] barancev: here is a sample script: https://gist.github.com/3945806
[17:17:41] AutomatedTester: jimevans: so plan of action? fix or are we releasing?
[17:17:47] lukeis: but yeah… i see that 2.25 isn't 'enabling' it by what you said…. i wonder which version may have actually had it working...
[17:18:27] smccarthy has joined #selenium
[17:18:27] barancev: if you run it, you can see that actual capabilities are Capabilities [{platform=LINUX, javascriptEnabled=true, cssSelectorsEnabled=true, hasMetadata=true, handlesAlerts=true, browserName=firefox, nativeEvents=false, webdriver.remote.sessionid=1351081697660, takesScreenshot=true, version=10.0}]
[17:18:38] jimevans: lukeis: apparently, it's been broken at least as far back as 2.18, according to barancev.
[17:18:45] lukeis: man...
[17:18:58] lukeis: what about on windows?
[17:19:03] jimevans: barancev: is that accurate?
[17:19:14] Dude-X: i don't think that's true, i've tested native events in linux using 2.23, 2.24, 2.25
[17:19:27] lukeis: Dude-X: are you *sure* it's enabled? :)
[17:19:43] jimevans: Dude-X: have you checked the capabilities you've gotten back from the driver to make sure it's *really* enabled?
[17:19:46] barancev: Dude-X: via FirefoxDriver or RemoteWebDriver?
[17:20:37] jimevans: oh, right. this issue only manifests itself via RemoteWebDriver, right?
[17:20:42] Dude-X: FirefoxDriver, java, I've observed tests are twice as slow; drag and drop events look better with Native events when i'm looking at Firefox. Click events work consistently on CSS :hover things
[17:20:42] bfife: were there any webdriver chats at GTAC 2012 that might have been recorded and floating around anywhere?
[17:21:00] bfife: just watched the 2011 one with the fire alarm.
[17:21:05] AutomatedTester: bfife: there was no GTAC 2012
[17:21:59] bfife: guess that would do it.
[17:22:28] barancev: let me make some additional experiments on my Linux VM, in a couple of hours I hope to provide more info on the issue

[17:38:53] AutomatedTester: you ok?
[17:38:54] ner0x: jleyba: Maybe not in the main project. But an "official" perl binding is more along the lines of what I meant.
[17:39:37] Androidnewbe: is it possible to stop pop up blocking fomr the test script ?
[17:40:21] awilson820 has left #selenium
[17:40:35] barancev: I'd prefer "certified" instead of "official" -- we need a sort of test set that a subproject should implement and pass to be "certified"
[17:40:59] ner0x: barancev++ # precisely.
[17:41:26] ner0x: Either way, I'll volunteer my services for the perl version of such a binding.
[17:43:34] barancev: ok, I run a test on my local Linux VM -- it can set native events on or off (via RemoteWebDriver, from a windows host machine)
[17:43:45] lukeis: hey jleyba are you aware of any testing abilities for Chrome on Android? or do you guys just manually test that?
[17:44:23] barancev: so the question now is: why sauce don't set native events on?
[17:44:38] jarib: lukeis: the new chromedriver will probably address that eventually
[17:44:48] jarib: (from reading the design doc)
[17:45:06] lukeis: via simulator?
[17:45:24] lukeis: or embedded on a device?
[17:45:56] jarib: i guess "all of the above" since it's using the remote debugger
[17:46:23] *jarib is guessing
[17:46:27] lukeis: :)
[17:47:14] jarib: but i'd be very surprised if that's not what's about to happen.
[17:48:15] jleyba: lukeis: What do you mean testing abilities?
[17:48:37] lukeis: like run selenium or any automation framework against it
[17:48:52] jleyba: no, it's not possible
[17:49:15] lukeis: *yay*
[17:49:56] ner0x: jleyba: Do you have a suggest in regards to the certification, etc.
[17:50:59] jleyba: ner0x: implement a client that uses our protocol and implement our test suite.  if you can pass the test suite using the Selenium server, then you're considered compliant
[17:51:20] jleyba: lukeis: It won't always be like that
[17:51:49] lukeis: the future chromedriver? like jarib is guessing?
[17:52:22] ner0x: jleyba: Two exist currently. Any docs on the difference between RC and WebDriver ?
[17:52:58] jleyba: ner0x: forget RC, it's been marked for death (Selenium 3.0 will officially deprecate it)
[17:53:22] jleyba: That, and no one ever touches it anymore unless they absolutely have to
[17:53:47] jleyba: ner0x: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol
[17:54:16] ner0x: jleyba: Not for myself. I just want to learn the difference in order to tell if the perl bindings need a rewrite/are deprecated.
[17:54:47] ner0x: I figure the more I learn, the better suited I am for implementing your test suite.

[20:21:24] santiycr: that's what sauce says

[20:23:40] santiycr: oh, I see
[20:23:47] santiycr: that part may come from selenium's 
[20:24:07] santiycr: ok, so here's my read of what happened:
[20:24:27] santiycr: Sauce Labs gave up on this session, because no new commands happened in 180 seconds
[20:24:44] santiycr: then the test came back from the dead and started sending further commands 
[20:25:05] santiycr: though at that point, Sauce Labs had already given up and killed the session
[20:25:09] rtyler has joined #selenium
[20:25:26] santiycr: to address this, there's two options:
[20:25:46] santiycr: increase the amount of time that Sauce Labs will wait for new commands before deciding something went wrong on the client side
[20:26:03] santiycr: or just figure out what the client side is not sending new commands in over 180 seconds

[21:34:52] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: apparently firefox 16 has a useful feature to validate email addresses when you use html5 tags
[21:35:16] Dude-X: how can i disable that so that i can  test functionality
[21:35:19] KaibutsuX: i thought all html5 input type=email supported that>?
[21:35:33] Dude-X: safari doesn't 
[21:35:38] *Dude-X checks chrome
[21:35:50] KaibutsuX: execute_script(type=text)?
[21:36:28] Dude-X: ah disable it via javascript
[21:36:33] Dude-X: that's an easy way
[21:37:27] KaibutsuX: oh you wanted the hard way? ;)
[21:37:31] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: why do you want to disable it?
[21:37:50] Dude-X: i want to test functionality of entering invalid email
[21:38:11] Dude-X: i enter invalid email and then click 'submit'
[21:38:27] Dude-X: but Chrome and FF intervene. Which is cool, but it's not webdrive-able
[21:38:58] Dude-X: it's okay if i click submit on blank email though
[21:39:00] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: do you need a browser for that test?
[21:39:29] Dude-X: i'm testing that the page says "Please enter a valid email" in the error div of that page
[21:39:36] detronizator: :note jimevans just saw your message - I was having dinner :)
[21:39:37] selbot2: ok!
[21:39:57] Dude-X: on the other hand, we are targeting html5 browsers so maybe i don't need to test that explcitly
[21:40:01] KaibutsuX: Dude-X, you have js checking the email format in addition to the input type=email?
[21:40:40] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: HTML5 elements check it for you
[21:40:48] AutomatedTester: so the browser does the validation
[21:40:59] KaibutsuX: AutomatedTester: I know, thats why it sounded like he was trying to double test
[21:41:04] Dude-X: KaibutsuX: apparently the submit js does validate the email
[21:41:28] Dude-X: and it then displays a message at the bottom of the form to please enter a valid email
[21:41:36] KaibutsuX: if you have an html5 input then assuming the browser isn't broken, you would never get your own custom message in that div
[21:42:32] Dude-X: but i want to be thorough
[21:43:28] bfife: anyone know what revision 2.25 was cut from off-hand?
[21:43:34] Zack: @llaskin1 https://gist.github.com/3948815
[21:43:46] KaibutsuX: Dude-X: driver.get('url?email=bullshit')
[21:43:49] KaibutsuX:  :)
[21:44:07] Dude-X: nah that would go into the webservice/unit tests
[21:54:32] santiycr: barancev:  we have indeed upgraded chrome in our boxes

[22:03:38] barancev: santiycr: so you broke two tests :)
[22:04:13] santiycr: lol
[22:04:14] barancev: I guess they should be broken locally too
[22:04:16] santiycr: sorry about that
[22:04:27] barancev: need to run test_chrome
[22:04:44] santiycr: the browser version installed in our boxes now is:
[22:05:11] Dude-X: so the website i'm testing, it has jquery 1.7 and when i try to do a simple execute_script('return $('#parent');") the command doesn't return to the REPL at all
[22:05:43] santiycr: Win 7: 22.0.1229.94
[22:05:52] santiycr: Win XP: 22.0.1229.94
[22:06:02] santiycr: Win 8: 21.0.1180.89
[22:06:11] santiycr: Linux: 22.0.1229.94
[22:06:27] santiycr: we'll probably upgrade Win 8 within the next few weeks
[22:08:03] barancev: santiycr: I think you should know that it's impossible to run Firefox tests with enabled native events on sauce :)
[22:08:14] Zack: @llaskin1 I figured it out Thanks anyways
[22:08:34] santiycr: barancev: how did that happen?
[22:09:31] barancev: try to create a browser, request native events and call getCapabilities
[22:09:35] santiycr: we have native events running on sauce with every selenium outthere
[22:09:36] barancev: https://gist.github.com/3945806 -- here is a sample
[22:10:16] barancev: I mean FF on linux with native events on
[22:10:31] santiycr: oh, linux one
[22:10:35] barancev: it was a selenium bug :)
[22:10:47] santiycr: wow
[22:11:00] barancev: that was fixed by eranm and this broke our CI
[22:11:00] santiycr: maybe FF10 doesn't support native events with Se 2.25.0?
[22:11:05] Zack has left #selenium
[22:11:07] santiycr: I see
[22:11:10] santiycr: darn
[22:11:25] santiycr: could this be connected to the fact that we don't have a window manager running on our linux boxes?
[22:11:35] barancev: no
[22:11:54] santiycr: does this work just fine locally?
[22:11:56] barancev: I think no, may be it is connected
[22:12:00] santiycr: linux + firefox + native events
[22:12:13] barancev: it is true always when you run tests on linux remotely
[22:12:26] barancev: locally with FirefoxDriver all is ok
[22:12:46] barancev: remotely native events can't be activated
[22:13:19] barancev: this will be fixed in 2.26
[22:13:51] barancev: time to go
[22:14:10] santiycr: barancev|NotHere:  thanks for getting to the bottom of this
