[00:41:24] Dude-X_: i was reading the discussion on git vs svn that occurred earlier in the chatâ€¦ after using git for the last two years, it is familiar to me, but I feel it can be a bit hard to manage history when you branch off like crazy; bzr and mercurial actually keep track of history
[00:46:52] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[00:50:16] Dude-X_: AutomatedTester, i was thinking that the best way to support python3 is to start with python3.3 only-- i kind of don't trust importing "unicode literals" for a unified python2/3 code baes
[00:51:18] AutomatedTester: why dont you trust it?
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Oct 16 01:00:40 2012]
[01:00:40] Dude-X_: according to the #python folks, it can lead to inconsistencies that are hard to track
[01:07:38] Archdude_ has joined #selenium
[01:09:26] AutomatedTester: Dude-X_: so drop support for  < python3?
[01:10:06] Dude-X_: for a unified base, i think it's better to start with support for python 3.3
[01:10:36] Dude-X_: dropping python 2.6, 2.7 is not something i'm recommending
[01:10:57] AutomatedTester: but the best way to support 3 is not to support them?
[01:11:22] Dude-X_: Yes
[01:11:51] AutomatedTester: ok...
[01:12:01] Dude-X_: that would be best because it makes the code base simpler without trying to handle different url lib libraries
[01:12:12] Dude-X_: it's a minor issue
[01:13:04] AutomatedTester: I would rather have a buggy 3 support and have 2.6 and 2.7 support
[01:13:48] AutomatedTester: anyway, I shall sleep on the idea

[10:26:02] SamuraiJack: instead of launching Chrome locally
[10:30:41] SamuraiJack: or how I can launch chrome on remote web driver server? the wiki page does not contain any information how to specify the browser, host and port

[10:47:48] SamuraiJack_: hm.. so RemoteWebDriver class has a constructor, which accept URL as 1st argument
[10:47:58] SamuraiJack_: probably what I'm looking for
[10:48:10] SamuraiJack_: no docs about it, at all
[10:48:17] SamuraiJack_: but ChromeDriver does not have such constructor
[10:48:44] SamuraiJack_: so even if its a subclass of RemoteDriver, it can't be used as remote instance?
[10:52:14] barancev: a subclass does't obliged to have the same constructors as the base class
[10:53:48] SamuraiJack_: I'd expect, that all subclasses of RemoteWebDriver could be used with remote server..
[10:55:47] SamuraiJack_: child classes usually extends some functionality of parent class, not removes it

[11:11:00] dekroning: hi all
[11:11:40] dekroning: how can I make sure tasks get run in parallel? and i'm wondering how this works with sessions, do they get shared? if so what happens when two parallel tests require different logins?
[11:15:42] andreastt: Back
[11:16:29] andreastt: dekroning: Sessions in browsers?  They won't be shared.
[11:17:11] andreastt: As for logins to your web app: You need to make sure your app is testable and can circumvent any issues you might have with dual logins.
[11:18:27] BarbS: @simonstewart i cannot share the web since it's a product that we are about to release :(
[11:18:57] BarbS: but i can send you the reference to the element to see if it helps
[11:21:38] jamesoram: BarbS, when I've had that issue it was because there were duplicate IDs on the page
[11:22:05] BarbS: "
[11:22:59] BarbS: @jamesoram that sucks... in this case that's not the issue because i looked for it and there is no duplicate id and also I am finding the element by its css and still nothing

[11:45:34] SamuraiJack_: yes, I'm sure - i don't have any proxies in setup - my machine is just connected to router
[11:45:55] SamuraiJack_: and router does all the connection, I have only DHCP
[11:46:05] dekroning: andreastt: what do you mean circumvent any issues with dual logins? you mean in terms of temporal couplings ?

[11:48:47] SamuraiJack_: this exception is thrown during instantiation of RemoteWebDriver instance..

[17:51:05] eranm_: And the other one?
[17:51:23] barancev: but it hid another one that causes current failures, and I can't understand the root cause
[17:52:41] eranm_: Is it visible on the CI? Which browser/os combination?
[17:52:41] barancev: here is a script: https://gist.github.com/3900604
[17:53:12] barancev: you can run it on 17633 and 17632 to see difference
[17:53:49] eranm_: Do you happen to have a log?
[17:53:56] barancev: 17633 gives this result: https://saucelabs.com/jobs/804d371f33484a889f8011c4ed5307f3
[17:54:34] barancev: it's caused by getBoolPref issue you've fixed later, np
[17:55:05] barancev: I've updated to 17633 and made the same changes, to eliminate getBoolPref exception
[17:55:24] eranm_: ok, so that's for the fixed problem?

[18:02:07] dawagner: Thanks for doing this barancev!
[18:03:20] barancev: yes, I spent the whole day experimenting :)
[18:03:59] barancev: and I still ca't understand where is the poison in this commit
[18:04:43] santiycr: If our CI ran fast enough, we'd be able to red flag commits on real time
[18:04:57] santiycr: so that people wouldn't have to go back and investigate days after the commit was made
[18:05:19] santiycr: the reason I'm saying this is because I'm one of the responsible for making that happen :)
[18:05:29] barancev: unfortunately this commit had two issues, one hiding another
[18:05:59] dawagner: santiycr: In general, we do have per-commit feedback, and it's within an hour, which is definitely good enough
[18:05:59] barancev: and when first one was fixed -- it was impossible to understand when the second one was introduced
[18:06:08] dawagner: The problem was we turned CI off for a month ;)
[18:06:17] santiycr: oh really!
[18:06:23] dawagner: s/we/I/
[18:06:24] santiycr: well, 1 hour is good enough
[18:06:27] santiycr: but far from ideal
[18:06:33] santiycr: I'd want that to be 10 minutes
[18:06:54] dawagner: tbh the best way for us to do that is to de-prioritise certain browsers
[18:07:04] santiycr: once we had 10', we'd be able to make the CI server block commits when red
[18:07:29] santiycr: I feel like my plan to cache the selenium jar could help
[18:07:34] santiycr: and bumping the parallelization :)
[18:07:36] dawagner: If we made sure a firefox and an IE at the head of the queue, every time a commit comes in, even if there's already a long queue, we'd probably get enough feedback quick enough
[18:07:46] dawagner: I thought we were caching the selenium jar already?
[18:07:51] santiycr: not yet
[18:07:53] santiycr: sorry :(
[18:08:55] santiycr: ok, I'll make that happen this week. Promise! 
[18:09:02] dawagner: hehe thanks!
[18:09:12] santiycr: just need a solid hour without Sauce meetings :P
[18:09:18] dawagner: You'll definitely never hear me complaining about you guys, though!

[18:10:14] santiycr: so, you guys should be able to test it in CI
[18:10:16] barancev: atm we unpack 5 geckos, and only after that we fallback to prebuilt
[18:10:23] santiycr: as well as most of the browsers running on Win 2012

[20:13:29] jleyba: (assuming the page is valid HTML)
[20:17:01] jimevans: assuming the page is HTML, i don't know. that usually would mean document.cookie = 'whatever...
[20:17:02] jimevans: '

[20:17:19] jleyba: Is that all you do for cookies?  inject a document.cookie =?
[20:19:07] jimevans: yep, that's pretty much it. the operative code is in DocumentHost::AddCookie() (/trunk/cpp/IEDriver/DocumentHost.cpp, line 252)
[20:19:56] jleyba: Interesting
[20:20:40] jleyba: We've got a case where addCookie consistently fails, but you can catch the error and immediately call driver.executeScript("document.cookie=") and it works as expected

[20:22:03] jleyba: How do I do that?

[22:31:51] barancev: let's try to add a jenkins job for IE10?
[22:32:04] Ardesco: is there a jenkins job for safari ?
[22:32:17] barancev: Ardesco: no
[22:32:43] aivaturi has left #selenium
[22:32:53] Ardesco: getting a single failure that on the face of it seems unrelated to code i've touched which is most vexing
[22:33:11] *Ardesco wonders what he touched without realising it
[22:33:16] *Ardesco goes digging
[22:36:32] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: create diff, revert all, retest
[22:36:50] AutomatedTester: if it is still failing with weird error then chances are its not your code
[22:36:57] AutomatedTester: then reapply diff
[22:36:58] alexglow: andreastt: thanks!
[22:37:57] Ardesco: trying an extension rebuild and another run first just to double cheek :)

[22:56:29] jimevans: err, on windows, i should specify.
[22:57:03] Ardesco: sorry :(
[22:57:15] Ardesco: stolen my wife's mac
[22:57:30] Ardesco: and it sounds like its trying to take off
[22:57:31] AutomatedTester: drat
[22:57:43] AutomatedTester: theres me with out a windows VM
[22:57:45] AutomatedTester: anywhere
[22:58:36] barancev: jimevans: I can try
[22:58:37] jimevans: i don't have a good java development environment on my windows vms at the moment.
[22:58:57] AutomatedTester: I am such a tool
[22:59:13] AutomatedTester: I have firefox patches waiting to be landed that I totally forgot about
[22:59:37] jimevans: barancev: i'd love to see if my most recent IEDriverServer checkin allows parallel IE execution on different threads. specifically the code at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/selenium-users/b745RTeK_ec/8eT_lG-JxCYJ should work.
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Oct 16 23:01:04 2012]
[23:01:04] barancev: in parallel, ok, 5 min
[23:02:30] jimevans: if it doesn't work, i won't be heartbroken, but i was able to throw a .net example together that works correctly with manually created threads (support for parallel execution of tests in the major .net test executors is dicey at best)
[23:04:25] barancev: with new prebuilt IE server?
[23:04:37] jimevans: yes, in the prebuilts directory.

[23:07:48] jimevans: some days, you eat the bear; some days, the bear eats you.
[23:07:55] Ardesco: not my code , the test seems to be failing anyway
[23:07:58] barancev: let me try more than 2
[23:09:01] jimevans: barancev: do you have any zombie iedriverserver.exe processes hanging around? (you shouldn't, but i want to be sure)
[23:09:05] barancev: four ones: https://gist.github.com/3902446
[23:09:35] barancev: no zombies around
[23:09:44] jimevans: excellent.
[23:09:51] barancev: nice job!
[23:10:05] jimevans: amazing what the well-placed mutex can do. :)

[23:15:03] Ardesco: is there a specific code formatting definition for se?
[23:15:09] Ardesco: i have a patch for safari driver
[23:15:23] Ardesco: can't see anything specific in the wiki
[23:15:34] jimevans: hey, i was looking for an issue associated with this, but my search-fu failed. yes, i believe it can be closed.
[23:16:18] barancev: you honored to close it :)
[23:16:46] jimevans: Ardesco: for javascript code, we follow the google javascript style guide (i think) http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml
[23:17:06] detronizator: jimevans: hey, can I consult you for something?
[23:17:28] Ardesco: so no formatting styles ie tab = 4 spaces, etc
[23:17:38] jimevans: detronizator: sure. happy to help. s'up?
[23:17:46] detronizator: well, it's actually a question for anyone that has made Drivers
[23:18:00] detronizator: so, I'm looking at the DriverService class in the Selenium/Java
[23:18:03] barancev: for Java we use google code style too
[23:18:11] detronizator: it seems like I should use that one
[23:18:37] jimevans: detronizator: that's my suggestion. it's what i did for .NET.
[23:18:59] barancev: in Java it's recommended way too
[23:19:03] AutomatedTester: seriously SSD ALL THE THINGS!
[23:19:17] detronizator: the class provides some nifty help, like it already has a "format" to print feedback in case the the Driver Service EXE is missing and stuff like that
[23:19:40] detronizator: at this stage though, GhostDriver needs someone able to build PhantomJS by hand from my branch
[23:20:29] detronizator: in other words: I shouldn't bother doing this "commit to selenium thing" until I have GhostDriver into PhantomJS
[23:20:58] detronizator: it's easy enough to do, but pointless as it will have to change anyway
[23:21:11] jimevans: detronizator: that's exactly why the PhantomJSDriver classes in the .NET bindings have a visibility of "internal" instead of "public". you can't instantiate them directly using the shipped compiled assembly.
[23:21:48] jimevans: (well, you *can*, but you have to use reflection, and that way be dragons and beasties)
[23:21:52] detronizator: well, if I add this patch in, PhantomJSDriver is going to be accessible to everyone using Selenium/Java
[23:21:52] Ardesco: blah can;t think of how to explain this right now, i'll create an issue with the patch tomorrow morning
[23:22:40] Ardesco: basically i've made safari driver generate a css locators instead of xpath ones internally
[23:23:02] detronizator: in other words: better to focus on doing the "merge ghostdriver into phantomjs" thing (that is already a problem on it's own)
[23:23:09] Ardesco: fixes some issues we have had firing JavaScript triggers into SVG objects
[23:23:11] detronizator: and than bother with the driver
[23:23:15] detronizator: driver-binding
[23:23:28] jimevans: detronizator: hey, no worries. we'll patch it in when the time is right. having the skeleton ready is cool.
[23:24:07] barancev: as usually, we can put @Beta annotation on it
[23:24:13] detronizator: yeah... the patching... that thing where I generate a text file and than I cut and paste it... and I feel like I'm 18 again...
[23:24:15] jimevans: in the meantime, i have the .NET tests i can run against ghostdriver, which will give us some measure of stability, say 80%, of the java tests.
[23:24:25] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: ooo
[23:24:34] detronizator: barancev: @Beta?
[23:24:36] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: add jleyba as a cc on the bug
[23:24:40] detronizator: that's a cool annotation:)
[23:24:42] Ardesco: k
[23:24:49] jimevans: detronizator: (/me channeling simonstewart) don't start! :D
[23:25:11] Ardesco: righty gnite
[23:25:29] barancev: detronizator: yes, a special annotation for new experimental API
[23:25:31] detronizator: jimevans: no worries. not going to.
[23:25:47] jimevans: i'm just kidding. it doesn't really bother me.
[23:25:56] jleyba: AutomatedTester: what bug?

[23:26:43] AutomatedTester: 23:38 Ardesco: fixes some issues we have had firing JavaScript triggers into SVG objects
[23:27:05] jleyba: I'll have to dig through the commit logs, but it uses xpath for a reason

[23:33:26] detronizator: gee - the code in ChromeDriver could be used almost as-is for PhantomJSDriver
[23:33:57] jimevans: AutomatedTester: excellent.
[23:34:48] AutomatedTester: jimevans: we are getting first real users for Marionette 
[23:34:56] AutomatedTester: and the pesky people are finding bugs
[23:35:07] jimevans: detronizator: yep. the code in the browser-specific driver service classes should be pretty thin.

[23:45:44] jimevans: jleyba: no, don't think so.

[23:49:40] detronizator: than the file upload stuff
[23:50:29] jimevans: i have a fix for most of the typing issues. once the atoms code passes code review, i'll check those in, then you can regen/update the atoms.
