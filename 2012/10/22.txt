[11:56:18] milligan: Read javascript :p
[11:59:55] milligan: AutomatedTester, Sorry for asking directly, but you seemed to know your way around selenium :P I have a page that contains elements that I cannot see by doing "view source" .. but using "inspect element" will show me the source for the item (it gets generated by javascript).

[12:00:39] AutomatedTester: milligan: whats the element?
[12:01:07] AutomatedTester: and when you say "inspect element" what browser are you using?
[12:01:17] james_o has joined #selenium
[12:01:20] milligan: I inspect it using chrome
[12:01:51] milligan: the element is a div that has an onclick, which in return submits a form
[12:03:05] AutomatedTester: and the form isnt showing?
[12:03:51] milligan: if I do a page - view source, I can't see it. I guess that's because most of the page is generated by javascript.
[12:03:59] milligan: if I inspect the element, I can see it.
[12:04:24] milligan: if I try to interact with it (i.e by fetching the element using id) using selenium, it says the element couldn't be found
[12:04:45] AutomatedTester: weird
[12:05:04] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[12:05:31] AutomatedTester: milligan: are you waiting for it correctly?
[12:06:07] simonstewart: One-Man-Bucket: there should be a preference to set. "java.enabled"? Something like that
[12:06:16] simonstewart: It'll be on the Mozilla dev docs somewhere
[12:06:23] milligan: AutomatedTester, could you define correctly please? :)
[12:06:27] simonstewart: Once you know the name of the setting, you can do something like this:
[12:07:00] simonstewart: FirefoxProfile p = new FirefoxProfile(); p.setPreference("string.you.find.from.mozilla", true); new FirefoxDriverâ„—;
[12:07:26] simonstewart: Where the last bit should be "new FirefoxDriver( p );"
[12:07:35] simonstewart: but autocomplete helpfully screwed things up for me

[15:36:36] barancev: or one can do the same on a local linux VM instead of sauce

[17:32:38] bmulholland: Hey guys, I'm writing out a test case for a page that's basically a series of options with a next/prev buttonâ€¦ The action is something like set option 1, hit next, set option 2, hit next, etc. I can then go back to the page and verify that the options are still what was selected. My trouble is in figuring out how to write a test script for thisâ€¦ there's so much duplication of code with all the ways I think of. Any recommendations?
[17:34:02] ngriffin has joined #selenium
[17:36:34] jimevans: bmulholland: on the surface of it, it sounds like a great use case for page objects.
[17:37:37] bmulholland: Oh, definitely a page object already. I guess I'm wondering how to format it. set_options(list_of_objects)?
[17:38:24] bmulholland: The trouble I have is that there's a number of scenarios. Sometimes I want to get all the options, sometimes I want to assert that the options are something, sometimes I want to set the options, and sometimes I want to do combinations thereof.
[17:42:25] nhirata_ has joined #selenium
[17:44:48] ArSn: bmulholland: Well basically you should have mutators for each option to set indivdually
[17:44:53] ArSn: like setOptionOne(value)
[17:45:55] ArSn: and then in your test you only call the methods for the options you want to test in this scenario
[17:46:13] ArSn: its also a good practice to have has*-methods in your PageObject, like "hasOptionOne", just to check if its available
[17:46:22] ArSn: hope that helps
[17:46:27] bmulholland: so then my test case would look like set_option_one(blah); next_option(); set_option_two(blah); next_option(); for ~7 options, then back to it, then assert(get_option_one() == blah); etc?
[17:47:12] bmulholland: that's what I mean with a lot of duplicate codeâ€¦ say I write out 10 test cases for this stuff, then I have like 20 sets of individually going through the steps that I'd have to change if the page ever does
[17:47:13] ArSn: yeah, why not
[17:47:23] ArSn: and the mutators should be encapusled by the page object
[17:47:36] ArSn: yes, but thats how tests work
[17:47:40] ArSn: they mostly are "dumb"
[17:48:01] ArSn: too much magic in your test case can ruin your test suite very quickly, and I'm speaking of experience
[17:48:02] ArSn: ;)
[17:48:13] bmulholland: okay, cool
[17:48:18] bmulholland: that's what I wanted to know :)
[17:48:30] ArSn: The best guideline is "keep your tests dumb"

[17:50:22] bmulholland: just goes against a lot of my conventional programming wisdom
[17:50:27] bmulholland: DRY and all
[17:51:02] ArSn: indeed
[17:51:06] bmulholland: but I'll try that. Thanks ArSn!
[17:51:12] ArSn: you're welcome

[18:10:28] adamgoucher: ArSn: you'd have to do some magic in the teardown to check the results and make a decision. of course, that path is fraught with leftover, resource consuming windows

[18:17:20] ArSn: adamgoucher: Well actually I didn't want to keep it like that forever, its just crap when my test case runs into an server error I can never see because the browser closes immediately
[18:17:38] ArSn: I tried overriding tearDownAfterClass and doing nothing but that doesnt seem to help unfortunately
[18:17:38] ArSn: :/

[21:18:56] jimevans: s'up?
[21:19:14] chrisculver701: if i recall you removed direct versioning from the selenium nuget right?
[21:19:23] chrisculver701: for dependencies
[21:19:33] chrisculver701: *direct - specific
[21:20:31] jimevans: no, but the JSON library that caused the problem hacked around the issue. 2.26 will not have *sigh* nuget dependencies because i've moved to ilmerge.
[21:21:53] chrisculver701: ah, i had to do a quick search of ilmerge
[21:22:22] chrisculver701: the reason i asked is that there are updates to json.net and castle.core and i'm leary of updating them
[21:24:09] chrisculver701: thanks for the info
