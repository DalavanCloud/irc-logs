[08:22:34] dekroning: hi
[08:23:08] dekroning: I'm using selenium standalone server on a windows xp machien with IE 8.0    now in my tests I do assertions after clicking some link or button. 
[08:23:22] dekroning: all other browsers chrome, firefox wait until the page is loaded before doing the assertion
[08:23:30] dekroning: but it looks like IE driver that is not the case
[08:23:45] dekroning: when I manually bring in delays infront of the assertions it works on IE
[08:24:00] dekroning: anyone have a clue how I might be able to get rid of this ugly delays before assertions?

[16:33:59] josePHPagoda: Hello everyone!  I've been learning selenium, and even made a few test cases with it.  I'm still quite the noob though.  Does anyone know how I could make a locater be something like "The span that has the following contents"?
[16:35:22] zac_sel: davehunt, not that I recall 
[16:36:46] jimevans: josePHPagoda: how about something like "//span[contains(., 'my contents')]"
[16:37:07] aivaturi has joined #selenium
[16:37:24] josePHPagoda: hmm, somehow I missed that method in the docs... thanks
[16:37:27] josePHPagoda: I'll try that out jimevans 
[16:38:20] jimevans: dammit, mozilla!
[16:41:56] zac_sel: or //span[text()= 'following contents'] if it's an exact string
[16:42:11] zac_sel: but even just whitespace can ruin that kind of xpath locator
[16:43:20] josePHPagoda: ah, so using xpath, that's clever
[16:43:24] josePHPagoda: and makes perfect sense
[16:43:35] josePHPagoda: I'm using the selenium IDE (and maybe that's not a good way of doing it)
[16:43:44] josePHPagoda: i've got "click" as my command
[16:43:53] josePHPagoda: and my target is //span[contains(., 'Watch')]
[16:44:13] josePHPagoda: but it doesn't seem to be simulating a click on that element... even though there is a span that has "Watch" in it
