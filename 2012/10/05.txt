[12:00:14] barancev: hi all!
[12:00:29] barancev: I have a piece of bad news about CI
[12:00:44] simonstewart: go for it
[12:01:51] barancev: 1) I've rolled back to revision 17632 that was green accoring to Jenkins logs, but now it fails with the same error "Error communicating with the remote browser. It may have died."
[12:02:29] simonstewart: That's not bad news. That's great news
[12:02:41] simonstewart: It means that it might not be our tests that are broken :)
[12:03:00] dawagner: Got an example log?
[12:03:06] barancev: I'm runing a test JavascriptEnabledDriverTest.testShouldBeAbleToClickALinkThatClosesAWindow
[12:03:09] barancev: :gist
[12:03:09] selbot2_: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[12:03:42] barancev: https://gist.github.com/3839298 -- here is the log on revision 17632
[12:04:02] barancev: sauce job is https://saucelabs.com/jobs/cc00ea054dfb4b91896db50a37ad3fa3
[12:04:54] barancev: 2) our tests (current ones) fail randomly
[12:05:12] barancev: compare https://saucelabs.com/jobs/f67436782c2d4d30bb30ee4a9789348a and https://saucelabs.com/jobs/b66873cc52784e508d0af98aec0091c6

[12:08:45] barancev: simonstewart: yes, locally firefox tests are green

[12:09:14] barancev: the idea was that we've made a change that broke tests on sauce
[12:09:25] andreastt: How do I ignore a test based on browser and platform?  I want to ignore Opera on Windows.
[12:09:34] simonstewart: So it would seem
[12:09:50] simonstewart: dawagner: are the docs on the wiki about running a test on sauce up to date?
[12:09:56] dawagner: simonstewart: Yep
[12:10:13] simonstewart: andreastt: you need to make an Assumption at the start of the test
[12:10:28] simonstewart: You can't use our magic Ignore annotation
[12:10:34] barancev: but I run tests on revision 17632 that was green (seehttp://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Firefox%2010%20Linux%20Native%20Java%20Tests/1145/) and now they fail
[12:10:53] andreastt: assumeTrue(browser is opera)?
[12:10:54] dawagner: andreastt: assumeFalse(Browser.detect() == foo && TestUtilities.getEffectivePlatform() == bar)
[12:11:01] andreastt: Ah, Browser.detect().  Thank you.
[12:11:27] dawagner: barancev: Could be that Sauce changed something - that's what happened with IE6
[12:11:52] barancev: may be, we need help from their side, yes
[12:12:22] simonstewart: Leave a note for Santi?
[12:12:52] dawagner: I think they're all in Germany at the moment
[12:13:11] dawagner: barancev: Do you have a reduced test case that shows the problem?
[12:13:27] simonstewart: Could we just run that one test?
[12:13:31] barancev: btw, even "green" test (see https://saucelabs.com/jobs/f67436782c2d4d30bb30ee4a9789348a) is not ideal -- it took 36.56 sec to open an alert!!!
[12:15:14] barancev: simonstewart: yes, I run only JavascriptEnabledDriverTest.testShouldBeAbleToClickALinkThatClosesAWindow, it fails every run

[12:21:32] barancev: because we've already missed FF15
[12:21:33] andreastt: Should be out later today.
[12:22:32] barancev: seriousely, we can wait untill FF16 released
[12:23:03] andreastt: It's the same for me.
[12:25:43] simonstewart: I'd like to pull us back to doing weekly releases
[12:26:01] simonstewart: I noticed that once I got frantically busy and stopped pushing them, the pace slowed waaay down
[12:26:17] simonstewart: We should get 2.26 out ASAP to support Firefox 15 users.
[12:26:29] barancev: for weekly releases we need working CI
[12:26:39] simonstewart: And then push 2.27 as soon as possible for Firefox 16
[12:26:42] simonstewart: Yes, I know
[12:26:55] simonstewart: But I think it's important to state what we're aiming for
[12:27:05] simonstewart: Because right now, we're letting it drift
[12:27:22] simonstewart: If I wasn't taking time off to spend with the family, I'd be digging in

[15:27:11] MadMerlin|work_: using the phpunit se2 bindings and i'm noticing that $this->url("..."); will often interrupt the previous action
[15:27:35] MadMerlin|work_: for example, if i have se2 click logout, and then navigate somewhere with url, i'm often not logged out
[15:28:01] MadMerlin|work_: adding a sleep before the url "fixes" usually fixes it but is tremendously ugly, is there a better way?
[15:32:29] AutomatedTester: MadMerlin|work_: using adamgoucher's stuff or the facebook ones?
[15:32:51] MadMerlin|work_: the phpunit ones
[15:33:26] adamgoucher: regardless, click() doesn't block [pretty sure at any rate] so you have to wait until things are finished.
[15:33:55] MadMerlin|work_: even if the click triggers a form submit?
[15:34:44] adamgoucher: the only thing in the spec that bocks is url() from what i can interpret
[15:34:58] MadMerlin|work_: hmm
[15:34:59] AutomatedTester: in the spec and in webdriver might not be the same currently
[15:35:18] adamgoucher: trueâ€¦
[15:35:39] AutomatedTester: if you are not using native events then click will try see if you moving to a page and then handle it like get()
[15:35:48] adamgoucher: but then again, my code is heavily synchronized
[15:36:05] *adamgoucher doesnt trust browsers
[15:36:07] MadMerlin|work_: i guess it's just a little different with url then, since it can always execute immediately
[15:36:18] MadMerlin|work_: whereas if the element doesn't exist yet, you have the implicit wait
[15:36:35] AutomatedTester: but if the url doesnt change then it might think that the page doesnt require a wait
[15:37:20] AutomatedTester: as adamgoucher says, its better to be a little over cautious with sync code
[15:37:23] *adamgoucher looks for his soapbox â€¦ implicit waits biting you in the butt? do tell? :)
[15:37:58] *jimevans is starting to wish we'd never introduced implicit waits.
[15:38:15] *adamgoucher thinks people should listen to him more often :P

[16:28:53] Dude-X: i don't know what's the motivationâ€¦ i don't use node.jsâ€¦ the idea of using javascript to write a test framework makes me a bit nauseous
[16:29:55] AutomatedTester: xMartin: admc's wd.js and webdriver.js have slightly different API
[16:30:19] AutomatedTester: never used camme's version
[16:30:25] barancev: well, I know I'm full idiot in JS, but I thought there is a standard (knows as EcmaScript), no?
[16:30:28] xMartin: i have a client-side javascript app and i think it's a good idea to have all my code in js
[16:31:10] Dude-X: then that's fine
[16:31:27] xMartin: barancev: that's only the language. there is no standard environment. expect commonJS approach which is not really supported a lot
[16:31:37] AutomatedTester: xMartin: the official webdriverjs works client-side iirc
[16:31:37] xMartin: except
[16:31:48] AutomatedTester: except you dont get all the native events stuff
[16:32:09] AutomatedTester: and you are hemmed by the JS sandbox in the browser
[16:33:19] barancev: so, if my app uses only standard API it can be considered "env-independend", as opposed to an app that uses env-specific API or has env-specific assumes
[16:34:22] AutomatedTester: barancev: javascript is environment independent all the time. The modules/packages people create might not be independant
[16:34:26] xMartin: barancev: there is no app that doesn't need an environment like the DOM or nodeJS
[16:35:36] xMartin: AutomatedTester: what does hemmed by the sandbox mean? on the website it says it also works on node http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs#Node
[16:36:07] AutomatedTester: xMartin: all JS that runs inside a browser is constrained by the browsers js sandbox
[16:36:18] xMartin: sure
[16:36:19] AutomatedTester: it limits certain interactions because of security concerns
[16:36:41] AutomatedTester: if you run the node.js version, you will need to run the selenium server 
[16:36:47] AutomatedTester: and that gets around the sandbox
[16:38:21] xMartin: yes, ok. that's what i expected. but it's the same for WD as far as i know
[16:38:52] AutomatedTester: well python, .net, java, ruby can connect directly to the browser with the selenium server
[16:39:19] AutomatedTester: but all the js implementations, I have seen, just do remotewebdriver
[16:40:16] xMartin: yes. so i still wonder how they compare to each other
[16:40:38] AutomatedTester: xMartin: what they do is the same if they speak our protocol
[16:40:49] AutomatedTester: so its just which API you perfer
[16:41:10] AutomatedTester: webdriverjs has Promises where I dont think wd.js does
[16:41:32] AutomatedTester: so our webdriverjs can have a synchronous look to it
[16:41:46] AutomatedTester: and wd.js needs the callbacks to be visible

[17:11:36] dawagner: detronizator: I am!
[17:12:01] detronizator: dawagner: hi! so, you mentioned the HttpProxy != Proxy thing in my PhantomJSDriver
[17:12:04] detronizator: makes absolute sense
[17:12:15] detronizator: actually, PhantomJS supports both HTTP and Socks 5
[17:12:31] detronizator: but, based on what I see in the class Proxy
[17:12:37] detronizator: selenium doesn't support socks 5
[17:12:39] detronizator: right?
[17:12:51] detronizator: or does it only through a PAC file?
[17:13:31] dawagner: So, org.openqa.selenium.Proxy has two definitions of what kinds of proxy we support
[17:13:41] dawagner: There are types, and there are ? methods?
[17:14:19] dawagner: The types are: Direct (no proxy), Manual (a manually configured proxy), PAC (autodetect proxy) and System (use whatever the system uses)
[17:14:24] dawagner: Manual has different things you can specify
[17:14:29] papegaaij has joined #selenium
[17:14:35] dawagner: It can be HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS, FTP
[17:14:44] dawagner: You can set any or all of them
[17:14:52] dawagner: (It looks a lot like the proxy dialog in browsers, actually)
[17:15:16] dawagner: So to set SOCKS, you would set type to direct, and socksProxy to the hostname:port
[17:16:03] detronizator: mmm, where is the socksProxy you mention?
[17:16:13] detronizator: I can only find a "TODO SOCKS" in the Proxy class

[18:51:23] jimevans: because of the control IDs of the labels on those dialogs, anything that would find the user's prompt message text would fail to find the message text for alert() and confirm() dialogs.

[19:13:40] MadMerlin|work_: when i say page change, i mean the url the browser is on changes after the specified action
[19:13:48] MadMerlin|work_: not any random dom change
[19:14:03] jimevans: are you asking to wait for the page to load?
[19:14:26] MadMerlin|work_: more or less
[19:14:42] MadMerlin|work_: i'm clicking a link which i know will cause the browser to go to a new page, is there an easy way to wait for the new page to load?
[19:14:55] jimevans: then my previous statements still stand. to get socratic for a moment, how do you expect to know when the page is loaded?
[19:15:06] jimevans: does it mean when all of the HTML has been downloaded?
[19:15:15] jimevans: does it mean when the DOM has been initially parsed?
[19:15:31] jimevans: what about DOM modifications done via javascript?
[19:15:41] jimevans: what about javascript executed via a setTimeout()?
[19:15:58] MadMerlin|work_: either domready or onload fired would be fine
[19:16:15] jimevans: i'm sure you know what *you* mean when you say "the page is loaded", but that doesn't necessarily mean that everyone else means the same thing.
[19:16:37] jimevans: so webdriver, being a general-purpose library, can't come up with a one-size-fits-all solution.
[19:17:01] MadMerlin|work_: onload fired is a pretty common understanding of "page is loaded", if you have more special requirements than that, i think it's reasonable that you need to code them up yourself
[19:17:10] jimevans: to continue being socratic, what's the next thing you want to do after the page is loaded?
[19:17:40] jimevans: (and i don't necessarily agree with your premise on the face of it, but i'm not going to argue)
[19:18:20] MadMerlin|work_: well, i can see the argument for not having a page load thingie like before, however, i'm trying to work around an issue i'm encountering
[19:18:32] MadMerlin|work_: right now, i'm checking to see if an element is present before doing anything with the page
[19:18:55] MadMerlin|work_: except, in ie, i'm finding that if you issue an xpath query at the wrong time, you'll get a javascript error
[19:18:57] jimevans: that's the proper way to do it. wait for the element you want to interact with after the page load to be available.
[19:19:20] MadMerlin|work_: more specifically, i click a link that changes the page, fire an xpath to check if the page has loaded, and crash
[19:19:30] MadMerlin|work_: because the xpath is issued to the page before webdriver is available
[19:19:38] jimevans: have you moved to the very latest IEDriverServer.exe? (i provided a link to download the checked-in-to-source one yesterday)
[19:19:58] jimevans: (hint: the latest one is *not* available from the downloads page yet)
[19:20:05] MadMerlin|work_: i didn't see that
[19:20:09] MadMerlin|work_: do you have the link handy?
[19:20:34] jimevans: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cpp/prebuilt/Win32/Release/
[19:20:53] jimevans: or you can do â€¦/x64/Release/
[19:21:26] jimevans: by the way, when you say "crash", what do you mean?
[19:22:18] MadMerlin|work_: i wrapped our xpath query function with loop that polls an execute of return (document.__webdriver_evaluate === undefined); until it succeeds, which solved almost all of the issue, but it can be racy
[19:22:32] MadMerlin|work_: when i say crash, i mean ie displays a javascript error and the test halts until i manually dismiss it
[19:23:32] jimevans: okay, so it doesn't take down the jvm or anything like that.
[19:23:50] MadMerlin|work_: no, no jvm crashes
[19:24:15] MadMerlin|work_: nearly as annoying from an automation perspective though
[19:25:09] MadMerlin|work_: trying the new driver server now
[19:26:02] jimevans: i don't dispute the annoyance. i just draw a distinction between a "crash" (taking down whatever runtime you're using) and an "unexpected exception being thrown"

[19:28:12] automated: hey guys.. am looking for ways to crawl all the hrefs i find on a page.. 
[19:28:26] automated: the problem is that some hrefs have aspx types
[19:28:32] automated: how do i handle these? 
[19:28:46] AutomatedTester: like you would any webpage?
[19:28:57] AutomatedTester: aspx is ASP.NET pages
[19:29:00] jimevans: AutomatedTester beat me to it. :)
[19:29:44] automated: so basically ignore those.. and move on.. test those pages seperately? 
[19:30:02] MadMerlin|work_: hmm, i'm seeing a different javascript error now, haven't seen this one before
[19:30:02] AutomatedTester: automated: treat them like html pages
[19:30:13] MadMerlin|work_: (Exception thrown and not caught)
[19:30:28] AutomatedTester: :yt Hannah Georgas - This is Good

[19:30:47] AutomatedTester: not the song I wanted but close enough
[19:32:14] automated: so would a basic GET to see if i a get a 200 should work on them too ?
[19:32:32] AutomatedTester: yes
[19:32:41] automated: cool.. thx
[19:33:28] MadMerlin|work_: however, i removed the xpath wrapper and i haven't seen the previous problem yet
[19:34:08] MadMerlin|work_: so that's a plus

[20:08:15] jimevans: barancev: that'd be a good question for jleyabe
[20:08:20] jimevans: jleyba even
[20:08:40] *jleyba ducks
[20:09:33] jimevans: jleyba: the question is "why is deps.js always changing? and if it's always generated, why are we checking it in?
[20:09:37] jimevans: "
[20:10:42] jleyba: dep.js is auto-generated whenever the ./go debug-server is built (don't remember what the actual target binding is) to ensure it has the latest info when you run JS tests
[20:11:25] jleyba: I'm pretty sure it can be svn-ignored, but I've not checked if there are any dependencies on it existing in the repo
[20:11:36] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[20:12:12] jleyba: our JS tooling needs some serious love
[20:15:55] xMartin has joined #selenium
[20:18:17] barancev: another interesting thing in the build system (a recent adition?) is so many mkdir's
[20:18:50] jleyba: where?
[20:19:25] barancev: look at http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Build%20All%20Java/2403/consoleFull
[20:19:50] barancev: 1) mkdir -p build/javascript/firefox-driver ten times in a row
[20:19:56] jleyba: I'm pretty sure that was Simon
[20:20:23] jleyba: I know he was experimenting with interface jars to help speed up the build.  Not sure if ever checked that in though
[20:20:31] barancev: 2) mkdir -p build/javascript/selenium-atoms before compiling each atom
[20:21:21] barancev: I'm sure it's not slowing down the build, but it's curious
[20:21:52] jleyba: each build target is treated as an independent action
[20:22:15] rpereira_ has joined #selenium
[20:22:28] jleyba: an action doesn't know if it's being run as part of a larger command or one off, so it has to ensure the necessary directories are in place
[20:22:44] jleyba: definitely could be smarter, but that's the current state of things
[20:23:46] AutomatedTester: jleyba: do you know if GTAC will happen again?
[20:28:59] jleyba: AutomatedTester: I've not heard anything
[20:29:07] AutomatedTester: :/
[20:29:14] AutomatedTester: it was my favourite conference

[20:30:25] selbot2_: llaskin was last seen 11 days ago, quitting.
[20:31:17] barancev: another question: why javac and jar operations are not present in the build log?
[20:32:13] jleyba: barancev: We call into ant for java build actions
[20:37:35] jleyba: AutomatedTester: for marionette, did you completely reimplement the fxdriver, fork it, or are you depending on the Selenium implementation?
[20:38:04] AutomatedTester: kinda forking, kinda reimplementing
[20:38:34] AutomatedTester: I lift some pieces out of FXDriver and put in marionette
[20:38:46] *AutomatedTester admittedly hasnt done much marionette lately
[20:39:33] *AutomatedTester is on clean up the straggler projects and get them closed off
[20:40:01] AutomatedTester: jleyba: howcome?
[20:41:51] jleyba: curious about the long term prospects of the fxdriver code base
[20:42:32] AutomatedTester: jleyba: long term prospect is we delete it
[20:42:57] jleyba: Cool.  Any chance marionette will work with FF10?
[20:43:27] AutomatedTester: jleyba: it will be in ESR releases
[20:43:39] AutomatedTester: dunno about 10
[20:43:44] AutomatedTester: but its in 17
[20:43:57] barancev: jleyba: I see, crazy-fun calls ant, but why loglevel is set to zero???
[20:44:22] barancev: only if DEBUG = true ant logging is set to 2 that is usable
[20:44:32] jleyba: barancev: No idea.  Check the svn logs to see if someone (Simon probably) left a reason
[20:44:54] AutomatedTester: any puppet super stars about?
[20:45:23] barancev: we have lots of mkdir and cp in the buld log, but almost no usable information what was compiled and jarred
