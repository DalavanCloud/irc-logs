[10:21:22] simonstewart: Short visit. The Boy is napping
[10:21:43] simonstewart: :note jimevans need a hand with 2.26?
[10:21:44] selbot2: ok!
[10:24:14] girija has left #selenium
[10:27:55] dekroning: when testing outside of your application, what is a standard way of creating setup data for your tests?
[10:28:14] dekroning: do you trigger some special API call or special website that is only availble in your integration suite?
[10:32:16] jibay has joined #selenium
[10:35:25] simonstewart: I tend to just poke the backend store directly if possible
[10:35:32] simonstewart: (using JDBC or some such)
[10:37:41] matt has joined #selenium
[10:38:19] jarib has joined #selenium
[10:41:15] dekroning: simonstewart: but how do you poke it?
[10:41:34] simonstewart: I use java, so databases I use JDBC directly
[10:41:38] simonstewart: (for example)
[10:42:24] dekroning: but how do you insert the data? Because if I would directly store data via sql insert for example, i'm loosing lot's of business logic processing which my object models do
[10:42:35] dekroning: it sounds brittle if I directly do inserts into the database
[10:43:12] simonstewart: The thing I'm suggesting you avoid is thumping into your UI. Is there a backend hook that your devs use to load data into the system?
[10:43:36] dekroning: simonstewart: no, but I would like to set that up as well :-)
[10:43:50] simonstewart: Set that up, and then use it in your tests :)
[10:44:20] dekroning: but then my tests become dependant on that data
[10:44:31] simonstewart: You can insert the data during the test run
[10:44:39] simonstewart: Preferably during the test itself
[10:44:51] dekroning: right, and I was wondering what people used to do this
[10:44:58] dekroning: sql inserts?
[10:45:12] simonstewart: And that's what I replied with: how I would do it
[10:46:13] dekroning: right so use SQL directly in your test setup
[10:46:22] simonstewart: Possibly
[10:46:41] simonstewart: Without knowing your circumstances I can't really give totally solid advice :)
[10:47:41] dekroning: our system as a lot of dependancies, e.g. I want to create a order, then that order contains a produc, that product needs to be a in a category, that categroy is part of a shop, that shop is part of a company, etc
[10:48:05] dekroning: not sure if there is like a special name for this pattern in testing :)
[10:48:14] dekroning: this kind of dependencies
[10:48:24] simonstewart: I'd be looking at some sort of Builder implementation
[10:49:04] dekroning: like Factories ?
[10:49:10] simonstewart: Similar
[10:49:39] dekroning: great
[10:50:08] dekroning: my thing with that though... :-)
[10:50:24] dekroning: I'm running my test suite not within my project it self
[10:50:39] dekroning: one of the reasons is because our system has many projects, which act as one platform
[10:50:46] dekroning: when I would like to use something like Factories
[10:52:07] dekroning: that means i'll also need to create the Factories on my test suite side, so then I have to implement most of my business logic on my test suite as well, is that correct? Hope that makes some sense
[10:52:24] dekroning: should the factories perhaps just talk to the higherlevel boundry objects within my system

[15:17:19] Kowal has joined #selenium
[15:19:28] Dude-X__ has joined #selenium
[15:19:52] Dude-X__: Hey Bear10
[15:20:21] Kowal: hi everyone! I'm trying to get selenium running against internet explorer and I'm running into numerous random problems which maybe someone can help me with. What I managed to do so far is, have the selenium-standalone-server.jar running IEDriverServer and run my test. It sort of works, but fail randomly locating the xpaths which should be successfully found. It seems that implict wait is not working correctly... Doe
[15:20:21] Kowal: s anyone experience the similar problem?
[15:20:26] Dude-X__: Oops wrong channel :p
[15:21:19] jimevans: Kowal: what happens if you explicitly sleep before trying to find the element?
[15:21:33] Kowal: jimevans: let me check 
[15:21:36] jimevans: (note, i'd never suggest that as a permanent step, but for debugging purposes, it could be useful)
[15:22:01] jimevans: i suspect your xpath doesn't evaluate like you think it should.
[15:22:23] jimevans: that is to say, it evaluates differently on IE than on other browsers.
[15:22:31] Kowal: well.... my xpath is "//ul[@class='products'][1]"
[15:22:38] Kowal: hmmm might be!
[15:22:44] Kowal: but it sometime passes..
[15:22:58] jimevans: then that's definitely a timing issue.
[15:24:03] *jimevans strongly dislikes implicit waits
[15:24:31] Kowal: I was even thinking of moving implicit wait to my test layer...
[15:24:38] mdgreenfield has joined #selenium
[15:24:51] Kowal: further more, from the log I see that error thrown way before 10 seconds
[15:24:57] Kowal: which is my implicit wait setting
[15:25:45] jimevans: implicit waits is not globally broken in the IE driver.
[15:25:46] Dude-X__: Stale element error?
[15:25:52] mdgreenfield has left #selenium
[15:26:37] Kowal: Dude-X__: I'm getting this one too, but in this case I have InvalidSelectiorException
[15:26:44] Kowal: (btw it has a typo :))
[15:27:02] Kowal: jimevans: you mean its not broken, or it is ?
[15:27:05] Dude-X__: That's been fixed 
[15:27:18] Kowal: hmmm I'm using 2.25.0
[15:27:33] Kowal: what should I be using ?
[15:27:55] jimevans: i mean it is not globally broken. it works for at least some people, including the webdriver project's integration tests that run on our ci server, therefore, it's not globally broken.
[15:27:59] Dude-X__: Oh. I guess it's fixed for the not yet released 2.26
[15:28:14] BarbS has joined #selenium
[15:28:32] jimevans: Dude-X__: what fix? for IE, or for the java bindings?
[15:28:41] Dude-X__: Java bindings
[15:28:44] Kowal: jimevans: can I help somehow to debug that ?
[15:29:01] jimevans: ah. okay. i didn't remember making any changes for that in the IE driver, so i was confused. :)
[15:29:37] BarbS: hello, I am trying to perform DragAndDrop with selenium for Python. Since there are two different frames working I decided to try droping on the location of the window
[15:29:55] jimevans: Kowal: i'm assuming you use java, yes? are you using RemoteWebDriver or InternetExplorerDriver?
[15:29:58] BarbS: was suggested by collaborators of the Selenium Google group
[15:30:23] Kowal: jimevans: I'm using python bindings
[15:30:24] BarbS: but I am facing the following error: WebDriverException: Message: u'Element cannot be scrolled into view:[object HTML
[15:30:29] BarbS: any ideas?
[15:32:18] Kowal: jimevans: so my settings for implicit wait is 10 seconds. But the message I get is like: http://pastebin.com/YxZ5MKCB
[15:32:36] Kowal: so it tooks 1.19 second to give me the failure
[15:32:55] Kowal: the conclusion I could draw from this, is that selenium/IEDriver acutally considers this xpath invalid
[15:33:10] Kowal: or implict wait is not working correctly
[15:33:45] stephend has joined #selenium
[15:35:20] rpereira_ has joined #selenium
[15:35:44] jimevans: one sec.
[15:36:56] jimevans: yes, a detected invalid selector (whether that detection is correct or not) will short-circuit the implicit wait.
[15:38:01] Kowal: jimevans: do you think somethink in: "//ul[@class='products'][2]/li[1]//input[@type='submit']" could be incorrect?
[15:38:19] Kowal: acutally it fail for me for a shorter version: "//ul[@class='products'][2]"
[15:38:37] BarbS: did you check with the IDE?
[15:38:49] BarbS: @Kowal
[15:38:56] Kowal: BarbS: I checked with Firefinder on firefox
[15:39:03] Kowal: and its looks good
[15:39:18] Kowal: althought who knows what IE thinks....
[15:39:30] BarbS: @Kowal every time i'm not sure about a xpath or css i check with the IDE with the find button
[15:39:41] BarbS: to see if the element it's being found
[15:39:56] Kowal: @BarbS do you mean some tools for IE ? 
[15:39:56] jimevans: Kowal: remember that IE uses a javascript xpath engine implementation.
[15:40:05] BarbS: yeah, IE is a whole other world
[15:40:07] jimevans: it's not native to the browser by any stretch.
[15:40:16] BarbS: no, usually with IE for me is guessing
[15:40:32] jimevans: you can try it yourself by using the engine in conjunction with the IE developer tools.
[15:40:36] BarbS: somethings click and some others dont
[15:40:39] Kowal: jimevans: anyway... the reason I think there is bug somewhere is that it fails randomly
[15:41:04] jimevans: Kowal: are you attempting to find the element immediately after a page load?
[15:41:33] jimevans: BarbS: there are known challenges with IE and native events.
[15:41:34] Kowal: jimevans: depends what you mean... yes, I have just entered this page
[15:41:52] BarbS: with IE for me works finding another element first and then findind and clicking the one that i'm liiking for
[15:42:21] BarbS: and usually after clicking I have a time.sleep(10) because I have read that the IEDriver is asynch
[15:42:49] jimevans: BarbS: http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/06/whats-wrong-with-internet-explorer.html
[15:43:13] BarbS: @jimevans yeah, that's what I read hehe
[15:43:14] Kowal: clicking is a different issue for me, basically it doesn't work for me using click() I had to use execute_script("arguments[0]", element) to get it clicking
[15:43:54] bperry has joined #selenium
[15:44:17] bperry: hi, can the hub run over https instead of http when using the selenium web driver with cuke tests?
[15:44:37] Kowal: *argumenst[0].click() of course
[15:44:38] jimevans: Kowal: i'm wondering if maybe the document object isn't fully available when you try to execute the find
[15:44:58] Kowal: jimevans: is there a way to wait for it ?
[15:45:02] jimevans: if there's no document, there's nothing to execute the javascript of the xpath engine against.
[15:45:21] Kowal: or maybe I should ask for forgiveness instead
[15:45:28] Kowal: and retry 
[15:45:55] BarbS: @Kowal LOL
[15:46:07] jimevans: Kowal: abandon using implicit waits, and use explicit ones instead. use the python equivalent of WebDriverWait.
[15:46:48] BarbS: self.driver.implicitly_wait(30)
[15:47:04] Kowal: jimevans: is it more like time.sleep() or is "retry 10 times, than fail" ?
[15:47:20] jimevans: BarbS: that's exactly what I'm suggesting *not* to do.
[15:47:48] Kowal: so if I understand correctly explicit wait is just a fixed sleep, right ?
[15:47:49] BarbS: sorry...
[15:48:04] jimevans: Kowal: the explicit waits poll for the expected condition, waiting for a small interval in between polls
[15:48:20] jimevans: most language bindings have a support class that handles this plumbing for you.
[15:48:28] ejelinek has joined #selenium
[15:48:29] jimevans: in java and .NET, it's called WebDriverWait.
[15:48:44] Kowal: python bindings doesn't have it, but its no a problem I have 10 fingers :D
[15:48:48] Dude-X__: It's the same in python bindings
[15:48:58] Kowal: hmm ok let me check than
[15:49:00] Dude-X__: It exists
[15:49:05] jimevans: it's also more configurable, in that you can tell it how long to wait, how often to poll, what exceptions to ignore while polling, and so on.
[15:49:07] Dude-X__: :apidocs

[17:12:16] Kowal: and it doesn't seem solve my problem
[17:12:30] Kowal: in the log server I can see 5 subsequent failures
[17:12:45] Kowal: of finding the element
[17:13:12] Kowal: (the xpath is: //input[@value="Pay with a loan"])
[17:13:17] mdgreenfield has left #selenium
[17:13:38] Kowal: but I can see the element on the screenshot and during the test
[17:13:55] Kowal: do you have any other idea why it might not work ?
[17:15:20] rgr_: Can you convert the xpath to cssSelector and try again? Maybe it can help you -> http://cssify.appspot.com/
[17:15:57] rgr_: input[value="Pay with a loan"]
[17:16:09] Kowal: without @?
[17:16:12] rgr_: yes
[17:16:20] rgr_: just try
[17:16:25] Kowal: sure, trying
[17:16:45] rgr_: but By cssSelector, ok?
[17:16:52] rgr_: not Xpath
[17:16:57] jleyba has joined #selenium
[17:17:28] Ardesco: don't really see what difference turning it into css would do
[17:17:57] Ardesco: have you checked your locator is valid
[17:18:06] Ardesco: using something like fire path/firebug on firefox
[17:19:02] rgr_: Ardesco is right. If this locator is invalid, or is wrong, will not do.
[17:19:58] Kowal: it's valid with @
[17:20:03] Kowal: it works on FF and Chrome
[17:20:11] Kowal: its just IE which is not cooperating
[17:21:19] rgr_: with cssSelector works?
[17:21:49] Kowal: no
[17:22:05] Ardesco: does IE render the page in the same way
[17:22:12] Ardesco: does IE add whitespace into the text?
[17:22:18] Ardesco: if it does the locator is now invalid
[17:22:18] rgr_: Which version of IE?
[17:22:33] Kowal: I just changed to //input[@id='credex-checkout"]
[17:22:35] Kowal: ie9
[17:22:46] rgr_: any addOn enabled could be make some trouble?
[17:22:53] Kowal: I have no addon
[17:22:58] Kowal: and I'm clicking other buttons before
[17:23:01] Kowal: so my guess is
[17:23:07] Kowal: that it has something to do
[17:23:18] Kowal: that this button has some properties changed by javascript
[17:23:23] Kowal: after the page loads
[17:23:38] Kowal: could it be ?
[17:23:55] Kowal: the properties being changed are style and id
[17:23:56] rgr_: what action are you doing with this locator? is it a button?
[17:24:07] Kowal: its input type="submit"
[17:24:18] rgr_: any possibility that the element is display:none?
[17:24:41] rgr_: Selenium works just for visible elements.
[17:24:44] Kowal: no, it's not
[17:24:58] Kowal: I change the background
[17:25:05] Kowal: and set text-indent to negative value
[17:25:06] rgr_: A workaround is use Java Script executor.
[17:25:09] aivaturi has joined #selenium
[17:25:15] Kowal: I also set heighh and width
[17:25:44] Kowal: like document.getElementById(id).click() ?
[17:26:03] rgr_: yes
[17:26:13] Kowal: hmmm I try that...
[17:26:19] Kowal: thanks
[17:26:57] rgr_: an example
[17:26:58] rgr_: https://gist.github.com/3939982
[17:27:24] rgr_: just replace it to your action (click)

[20:46:50] jleyba_: jimevans: Why does that need to be reverted?
[20:47:44] jimevans: according to the analysis done by barancev, that's the commit that broke the firefox native events tests on the ci server. no one can seem to figure out *why* they broke, but we need to resolve it so i can get a clear picture of where we are for 2.26.
[20:47:47] lukeis: it's causing a native event failure (or at least that's what barancev found when bisecting)  see the recent gist i linked to repro
[20:47:58] jimevans: and reverting is our only option at this point.
