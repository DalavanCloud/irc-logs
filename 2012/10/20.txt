[07:23:27] dhpe: Hi, can one adjust (or remove) a remote session timeout? E.g. if one opens a remote driver session and does not send commands for a while, then it timeouts at some point. I'd like to keep the session open longer or infinitely.

[15:37:23] deanclkclk: morning selenium folks
[15:37:28] deanclkclk: I have a question for u all
[15:37:40] deanclkclk: not really selenium related but,
[15:38:08] deanclkclk: is there a code coverage tool u all use that u can set the limit on and if the code coverage is below that limit..it breaks the build?
[15:42:09] Fyre: code coverage of acceptance tests is a pointless metric IMHO
[15:42:41] Fyre: nut to answer your question no I don't know of one, maybe somebody else will
[IRC logfile - Started Sat Oct 20 16:00:15 2012]
[16:00:15] deanclkclk: why u say it's pointless Fyre ?
[16:23:59] Fyre: because the gui is not likely to touch every area of the system
[16:25:23] Fyre: code coverage for unit test will tell you if you have missed something
[16:25:42] Fyre: code coverage for selenium tests is a willy waving nuber to put in front of some manager
[16:25:48] Fyre: of course this is all IMHO
[16:25:49] Fyre: :)

[16:43:14] deanclkclk: no no Ardesco_Home that's why I said it wasn't for selenium test
[16:43:17] deanclkclk: it was for unit test
[16:51:02] Ardesco_Home: ah missed that bit
[16:51:03] Ardesco_Home: :)

[21:22:38] jtfairbank: Hello guys
[21:22:48] jtfairbank: Is anyone online?  I have a Selenium question.
[21:23:06] Ardesco: just ask it, if anybody is here and knows the answer they will let you know
[21:23:20] jtfairbank: Ok cool.
[21:23:53] jtfairbank: So if I have a webpage that has JS on it (ex. an onload event or even something like <script>documen.write('example')</script>
[21:24:02] jtfairbank: Will Selenium execute the javascript?
[21:24:24] Ardesco: yup
[21:24:30] jtfairbank: ok sweet
[21:24:33] jtfairbank: thanks!
[21:27:43] jtfairbank: After I load the page, can I export it as an http response?
[21:27:56] jtfairbank: so, load the page through selenium to execute the JS
[21:28:09] jtfairbank: then send the loaded page as an http response to a different part of the application?
[21:31:11] ner0x has joined #selenium
[21:34:57] Ardesco: not sure what you're trying to do
[21:35:07] Ardesco: to get http response codes you'll need to use a proxy
[21:35:23] Ardesco: you can grab the source once the page has loaded an do stuff with that

[22:18:41] milligan: What could be wrong when Selenium managed to open my Firefox the first time I ran my program, but now it's crying about Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: c is null ?
[22:19:22] milligan: A millisecond after the error is thrown, the browser window pops up.
