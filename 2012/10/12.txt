[00:00:06] detronizator: And, just as info, git or mercurial or other stuff: as long as it worked "simple" as github 
[00:00:08] detronizator: or bb
[00:00:10] detronizator: or whatever
[00:00:58] AutomatedTester: detronizator: how do DVCS handle binary components?
[00:01:08] AutomatedTester: especially when you need to check them out
[00:01:46] AutomatedTester: since a clone brings the entire history down your download gets extremely large
[00:02:23] AutomatedTester: having a simple thing, like svn, keeps the heavy lifting on the server
[00:02:33] detronizator: ehm - I have tried to download the WHOLE selenium repo: never managed to do it and I'm now downloading only the portions I need.
[00:03:08] detronizator: bha': once you have done the "big download" once, it's not a big problem afterwards.
[00:03:12] detronizator: same as svn there
[00:03:30] AutomatedTester: detronizator: but with svn I dont have to download all the history 
[00:04:17] detronizator: I'm not sure how you do that: I see for me it downloads the whole thing and takes forever.
[00:04:39] detronizator: a DVCS might take a lot of time the first time, but after that it's no biggy at all
[00:05:03] detronizator: hence, you guys lose on new feature that streamline development and contribution, for a "1 time issue"
[00:05:21] detronizator: btw, where is this "big binary" that lives in the selenium svn anyway?
[00:05:42] detronizator: (I honestly don't know it - it is reguarly referred to, but don't actually know what you guys point at)
[00:05:56] AutomatedTester: detronizator: any jar file, any exe
[00:05:59] AutomatedTester: all of those
[00:06:02] AutomatedTester: its not 1 file
[00:06:58] detronizator: and those are there REGARDLESS it's SVN or GIT or MERCURIAL or whatever, right?
[00:07:04] AutomatedTester: they are
[00:07:19] AutomatedTester: but on DVCS I have to download every single version of those files
[00:07:26] AutomatedTester: with SVN i only get the latest
[00:08:01] AutomatedTester: you know the DVCS downloads the entire history of the repo down?
[00:09:01] detronizator: of course, but so how does an non-dvcs to handle checkout of previous versions?
[00:09:13] AutomatedTester: detronizator: if you want them you ask the server for them
[00:09:39] AutomatedTester: so if you are on a plane you are screwed
[00:10:19] detronizator: I really want to measure the amount of binary we are talking about
[00:10:32] detronizator: only this way I can continue bothering you guys or move on
[00:10:38] AutomatedTester: detronizator: feel free
[00:11:01] detronizator: at neustar we used mercurial for handling something like 4GB of binaries (browsers and other stuff) into a repo
[00:11:12] detronizator: slow the first time, but after that no one cared
[00:11:39] AutomatedTester: if svn is slow, DVCS is going to be slower
[00:11:42] AutomatedTester: and bigger
[00:12:01] detronizator: space on local machines is a no-problem nowdays, you know that
[00:12:10] AutomatedTester: detronizator: HDD is never an issue
[00:12:17] AutomatedTester: bandwidth is always an issue
[00:12:21] detronizator: of course
[00:12:42] detronizator: but do you guys really DON'T see what you are missing out in terms of advantages of using a DVCS
[00:12:45] detronizator: precisely
[00:12:48] detronizator: stuff like GitHub
[00:13:19] detronizator: screw what Torvalds thinks of GitHub being a "fucked up git": GitHub is a reference, something to measure against.
[00:13:30] detronizator: how can you NOT see how much this project is missing out?
[00:13:53] detronizator: how many more people, that find tons of docs on how to use Git, would be able to submit patches instead of bitching about?
[00:14:05] detronizator: I mean, if not many more, at least would increase the odds
[00:14:26] AutomatedTester: detronizator: so you are seeing people not doing any complaining about ghostdriver and only submitting pull requests?
[00:14:41] detronizator: I wish!
[00:14:58] detronizator: But I do also see people helping FAST because GitHub make it a breeze
[00:15:01] AutomatedTester: ok, so I dont see how that will fix it
[00:15:33] AutomatedTester: detronizator: if we were your average project I would agree
[00:16:27] AutomatedTester: but Selenium is far from average
[00:16:36] detronizator: have you guys considered NOT having those many "large binaries" outside the svn repo?
[00:16:46] detronizator: on an ftp maybe?
[00:16:59] detronizator: given there is no interest in "tracking" those
[00:17:14] detronizator: tracking beyond a simple "version number" I mean
[00:17:26] AutomatedTester: there goes the ability to checkout and run
[00:17:43] AutomatedTester: if you put it on a FTP
[00:19:07] detronizator: AutomatedTester: wow - you have the "crazyfunbuild" scripts to do all sort of shananigans? having an "init" script that populates with the latest binaries would be too hard to add?
[00:19:30] detronizator: the code would be versioned, as well as the version of binaries to download on "init"
[00:20:17] AutomatedTester: detronizator: post this to the dev mailing list
[00:22:06] detronizator: AutomatedTester: Naaa. If it was my project I'd feel more engaged in arguing. I'm already tired of arguing with you :) - you have clearly thought about it and if you don't see the massive advantage of a DVCS, and available to pay the initial burden, there is no point in me keeping this arguing going any longer (for now at least).
[00:22:47] detronizator: just one question: if selenium was starting today? would you still stick to svn?
[00:23:04] AutomatedTester: possibly
[00:23:51] AutomatedTester: detronizator: I prefer using the right tool for the right job
[00:25:09] AutomatedTester: somethings might not need to be in there having the ease of deploying a multiplaform egg/gem/jar for any platform is extremely useful
[00:26:14] AutomatedTester: on the biggest pain points in Mozilla is how slow HG is because we have to put certain things in
[00:26:35] AutomatedTester: a 1hr download of the tree 
[00:26:43] AutomatedTester: and then slow pulls/pushes
[00:26:43] detronizator: every day?
[00:26:57] detronizator: at ever pull/push?
[00:26:57] AutomatedTester: the tree is slow constantly
[00:27:00] AutomatedTester: yea
[00:27:23] detronizator: who hosts your hg?
[00:27:24] AutomatedTester: but we had to do DVCS there 
[00:27:25] detronizator: youself?
[00:27:27] AutomatedTester: and just be slow
[00:27:29] AutomatedTester: we do
[00:27:41] detronizator: maybe your ops people should talk with github
[00:27:42] AutomatedTester: we know how to scale sites
[00:28:05] AutomatedTester: detronizator: github havent got a single repo like ours
[00:28:25] detronizator: not even the linux repo counts?
[00:28:43] AutomatedTester: detronizator: does that get as much activity as we do?
[00:28:53] AutomatedTester: I thought it was just a mirror
[00:28:59] AutomatedTester: we have a mirror there too
[00:29:12] AutomatedTester: that gets updated every 20 mins
[00:29:46] AutomatedTester: detronizator: like I say, I prefer right tool for the right job
[00:29:51] AutomatedTester: not a silver bullet
[00:31:11] detronizator: maybe you are right - maybe the size of the project can be too much of a burden and I have dealt with too much svn and perforce crap that I'm biased towards git-silver-bullet.
[00:31:48] detronizator: I'll try to find the time to do a test though: see how big a git repo gets if I convert an entire svn repo in git (if there is a tool that does it - git-svn?)
[00:32:02] AutomatedTester: there are tools
[00:32:22] AutomatedTester: i know krosenvold did some things before and backed off the idea iirc
[00:32:54] detronizator: yeah, I saw the fact that he did mirroring on github - pointless, given that I couldn't use it to make pull reqs :)
[00:36:40] detronizator: Anyway, AutomatedTester: sorry to have dragged you in the boring-git-thing again :) - I'm not famous for my intelligence - more for my stubborness.
[00:37:20] detronizator: AutomatedTester: have a good night (what the heck you do awake - you have kids! you should be sleeping)
[00:37:40] AutomatedTester: just waiting for my last test of my puppet scripts
[00:37:42] AutomatedTester: then bed
[00:44:21] AutomatedTester: detronizator: btw you will hate me if you dont like svn
[00:44:31] AutomatedTester: I used dropbox as my VCS for my book
[00:44:53] detronizator: I used Git-over-Dropbox for a project of 3 people
[00:44:57] detronizator: worked flawlessly
[00:44:57] detronizator: :)
[00:45:25] jimevans: well i think that's just about enough playing around with the javascript keyboard in the atoms for one day.
[00:45:37] detronizator: I mean... flawlessly unless one of us would do something stupid like working on the directory INSIDE dropbox
[00:45:38] detronizator: :)
[00:46:53] detronizator: jimevans: hey, you here? I had a question about the keyboard thing actually - isn't the Atom handling that conversion for us?
[00:47:11] jimevans: no, it actually doesn't.
[00:47:19] jimevans: i was surprised too, but no.
[00:47:30] detronizator: jimevans: you mean you had to do it manually in IEDriver too?
[00:47:43] jimevans: the IE driver doesn't use the atom.
[00:47:47] jimevans: it uses native events.
[00:48:51] detronizator: jimevans: well, than I take from the thing you said above, you are trying to fix the atoms so that they do do the conversion?
[00:49:17] jimevans: no, i'm trying to get shift+[arrow key] to work in the javascript keyboard.

[00:52:59] detronizator: jimevans: cool - in that case I'll see myself to bed.
[00:53:01] detronizator: :)
[00:53:07] jimevans: :)
[00:53:34] detronizator: jimevans: I'm weirdly busy for one that is off work for few days
[00:53:52] detronizator: not sure I'm doing this "being between jobs" thing right
[00:53:53] jimevans: i'll bet.
[00:53:56] jimevans: :)
[00:54:15] detronizator: good night again

[11:36:34] andreastt: detronizator: Cc one of the committers
[11:36:40] andreastt: Like dawagner or myself.
[11:36:57] andreastt: To get write access to the wiki you need to talk to simon
[11:37:09] detronizator: I can't with my current permission level :) - and I don't have your personal emails :)
[11:37:54] dawagner: :log
[11:37:55] selbot2_: http://illicitonion.com/selogs/selenium/2012/10/12.txt | http://illicitonion.com/selogs/search
[11:38:48] andreastt: detronizator: Mine is my IRC nick + opera.com, you'll find the other committers by typing in a part of their name to the Cc field.
[11:38:56] andreastt: I think jimevans would be good to Cc.
[11:39:01] andreastt: He's been involved int his.
[11:39:49] detronizator: andreastt: just to clarify - you mean sending you a direct email about this patch? Or CC on the actual issue? In the latter case, I simply can't: I don't see the cc field.
[11:39:58] dawagner: detronizator: I'm doing so on your behalf :)
[11:40:21] detronizator: I must have the lowest possible access level
[11:40:25] detronizator: :(
[11:40:28] andreastt: I didn't know that!
[11:40:31] andreastt: (-:
[11:42:02] detronizator: dawagner: just added few comments about the tests
[11:43:21] dawagner: Cool :)
[11:43:30] dawagner: So, we currently have three different ways that drivers exist:
[11:43:49] dawagner: There's the ones we've written, which live in the main selenium code base, whose tests we run (because we wrote them!)
[11:44:59] detronizator: well, I have the drivers and the tests in the GhostDriver project. I'd have copied over those.
[11:45:16] dawagner: There's the ones we haven't written, which live elsewhere, but have some plumbing in the main selenium code base (e.g. the ChromeDriver, which has the bootstrapping class in code), but to actually run the tests you need to download a third party binary - we vaguely run their tests to make sure we don't break them
[11:45:42] dawagner: And there's the ones we haven't written, which live elsewhere, but are dumped entirely in the selenium code base (e.g. the OperaDriver)
[11:46:00] detronizator: how do you deal with the setup to run them?
[11:46:06] detronizator: manually?
[11:47:03] dawagner: The ChromeDriver expects the binary to be pointed at by a {system property,capability,being on $PATH}, and if it isn't, it throws with a descriptive error message saying "Go here, download this, put it here, set this property"
[11:47:24] andreastt: OperaDriver lives as a third party dependency in third_party for the convenience of running the tests, but it's not shipped alongside Selenium.
[11:47:37] dawagner: That would probably be a good model to follow, in terms of getting something up and running
[11:48:37] detronizator: dawagner: I think I'll have to wait for phantomjs to integrate ghostdriver first
[11:48:43] pos_ngram: -------
[11:48:46] pos_ngram: hi i have the following problem: https://gist.github.com/3877820
[11:48:48] detronizator: at the moment it's a bit difficult
[11:48:48] pos_ngram: i cannot run the firefox headless on a server
[11:48:51] pos_ngram: but the Xvfb works just fine, if i do not use the webdriver
[11:49:00] pos_ngram: can you help me ?
[11:49:12] AutomatedTester: andreastt: spoke to my editor, the Amazon team within my publisher are on the case and will update me in a couple days
[11:49:20] AutomatedTester: andreastt: they apologized about that
[11:49:44] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I apologise about that
[11:49:46] andreastt: Cool.
[11:49:57] andreastt: No problem for me to reorder it if needs be (-:
[11:50:00] dawagner: What stages are currently actually required to run the phantomjs driver?
[11:50:57] detronizator: 2 things: you need the phantomjs binary (built out of my fork) and the ghostdriver source
[11:51:21] dawagner: When you say the source...
[11:51:21] detronizator: phantomjs required MANY changes to make this project work and  now have a 4th set of changes to merge into the phantomjs master
[11:51:30] detronizator: I mean the ghostdriver JS source
[11:51:40] detronizator: ghostdriver is in JS anyway
[11:51:47] dawagner: Aha right
[11:51:49] AutomatedTester: http://shaneriley.com/firefox_skyscraper/
[11:51:58] AutomatedTester: needs Firefox though
[11:51:58] detronizator: AutomatedTester: saw that - mental!
[11:52:45] detronizator: dawagner: to make it very easy, I'd see having the phantomjs exec (with ghostdriver inside) sitting in your third_party directory
[11:53:07] detronizator: after that, we could throw tests at it without much assle (a capability to set - that's all)

[11:54:01] AutomatedTester: detronizator: are amazon going to be giving you time to work on GhostDriver?
[11:54:07] detronizator: I need to make a move - I hope we can go ahead with the merge of the PhantomJSDriver.java for now - maybe I should leave a message for jimevans to check how HE is dealing with tests of his .Net binding
[11:54:21] detronizator: AutomatedTester: I'm going to give time to myself to work on it :)
[11:54:32] detronizator: as I did before Neustar 
[11:55:20] detronizator: :note jimevans I need a hint on how I could deal with adding tests to the Selenium codebase for PhantomJSDriver.java. I have attached a patch to https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4644 too. Catch you later.
[11:55:22] selbot2_: ok!
[11:55:43] detronizator: AutomatedTester: why you ask?
[11:55:55] AutomatedTester: detronizator: my own curiousity
[11:56:10] AutomatedTester: I like it when companies give people time to work on projects
[11:56:29] AutomatedTester: detronizator: you are the first person I know at Amazon
[11:56:37] AutomatedTester: well, when you join :D
[11:57:08] detronizator: AutomatedTester: one of the things I'll work on is going to be making stuff "testable", and my work on PhantomJS and GhostDriver is part of the picture.
[11:57:48] detronizator: AutomatedTester: the guy that "hooked me in" was my boss at Betfair, were I added phantomjs to the CI to allow quick testing.
[11:58:03] AutomatedTester: cool
[11:58:14] AutomatedTester: I <3 Betfair
[11:58:15] detronizator: so, it's going to be fine. Worst case, I handle the development to you.
[11:58:19] detronizator: you do?
[11:58:21] detronizator: why?
[11:58:25] detronizator: you bet?
[11:58:26] AutomatedTester: their recruiter is Douglas Gambling
[11:58:36] AutomatedTester: I think that is his name
[11:58:37] detronizator: LOLZ - was. Now is in Skype. 
[11:58:58] detronizator: yes, it's the guy who hired me at the time. I was SHOCKED that that was his ACTUAL name :)
[11:59:04] AutomatedTester: he is at Skype?
[11:59:08] detronizator: yes
[11:59:16] detronizator: I didn't know Doug was so famous
[11:59:25] AutomatedTester: that explains why Skype are emailing me so much lately
[11:59:32] detronizator: did he try to take you out of Moz?
[11:59:43] *davehunt has spoken to Doug too :)
[11:59:50] AutomatedTester: no, he wanted me before Mozilla

[12:00:35] AutomatedTester: not for working there or their site
[12:00:56] AutomatedTester: I wouldnt have been able to work at Betfair before Mozilla anyway
[12:01:17] AutomatedTester: they were a client of ours so the non-compete would have made things interesting
[12:01:35] AutomatedTester: plus it was in London
[12:01:46] AutomatedTester: I like visiting London, wouldnt want to live there
[12:02:05] detronizator: AutomatedTester: who you were with before Moz?
[12:02:21] AutomatedTester: detronizator: I worked for a startup called EmailReaction
[12:02:29] AutomatedTester: who then got bought by smartFOCUS
[12:02:42] AutomatedTester: and then smartFOCUS got bought by EMV
[12:02:53] AutomatedTester: we made bulk emailing software
[12:02:56] detronizator: I see
[12:03:09] detronizator: just checked, you are not lying :P
[12:03:26] AutomatedTester: clients were News International, Easy Jet, MoneySuperMarket
[12:03:29] AutomatedTester: and many many more
[12:05:29] AutomatedTester: detronizator: if I get bored at Mozilla, which I doubt will happen for a while, my boss from EmailReaction is currently doing a new startup and I know I can get work there
[12:05:50] AutomatedTester: he is a really clued up guy
[12:06:22] detronizator: I doubt you'd get bored in an awesome place like Moz
[12:06:43] AutomatedTester: detronizator: believe it or not, people do
[12:07:44] detronizator: I'm not THAT awesome to get bored there, but I'm sure there are geniuses that might.
[12:08:11] AutomatedTester: detronizator: yea, I am not one of the geniuses so it will take a while :D
[12:08:19] detronizator: AutomatedTester: lolz
[12:08:36] detronizator: anyway, I need to run to the airport (again) - never been so buys when I was actually working.
[12:08:46] detronizator: hopefully going to work will make more free time
[12:08:50] AutomatedTester: laters detronizator!
[12:09:03] detronizator: I have jimevans pull requests waiting there for days now - he will soon shout at me :)
[12:09:08] detronizator: l8r guys
[12:10:45] AutomatedTester: does anyone use softpedia.com?
[12:13:46] dawagner: AutomatedTester: I believe softpedia occasionally email me saying "I see you have an open source project! Well, we've put it on our site!" in a somewhat dick-ish way
[12:13:51] dawagner: Though I may be thinking of someone similar
[12:14:00] AutomatedTester: that is them
[12:14:16] AutomatedTester: I just got an email about a Firefox Addon I made and put up on AMO
[12:17:33] dawagner: I largely ignore them and let them get on with it, but I'm not a fan
[12:22:20] AutomatedTester: dawagner: I ignore them too but I dont really see the point of them thats why I asked
[12:22:23] AutomatedTester: they arent harming me

[13:17:13] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Why can't I use the desired_capabilities keyword as an argument for webdriver.DriverImpl?  It's possible with webdriver.Remote.
[13:18:00] AutomatedTester: andreastt: there wasnt a need originally
[13:18:09] AutomatedTester: I can add it in
[13:18:46] andreastt: It's a little confusing to me.
[13:19:10] AutomatedTester: andreastt: tbh, very few people have asked for it
[13:19:13] andreastt: I'd expect to be able to override whatever the default capabilities for DriverImpl are by doing that.
[13:20:19] AutomatedTester: andreastt: 9/10 people who want to override things tend to be using remote
[13:20:23] AutomatedTester: and thats why its there
[13:20:31] andreastt: Also, totally unrelated: Is there any way I can get the output of any processes Python starts?
[13:20:35] AutomatedTester: andreastt: but feel free to fix
[13:21:31] AutomatedTester: currently we pipe the output because people complained about the noise it generated
[13:22:14] AutomatedTester: no one wanted to see the process output

[13:24:05] AutomatedTester: and since we work for the majority...
[13:24:11] davehunt: AutomatedTester: have you added the option for specifying desired_capabilities (or proxy) for the Chrome Driver? Want me to raise a bug for that?
[13:24:19] davehunt: I can even fix it if you like?
[13:24:34] AutomatedTester: davehunt: sorry, forgot about it
[13:24:45] AutomatedTester: andreastt: tell me what you want and I will do it now
[13:24:49] davehunt: AutomatedTester: no problem :)
[13:24:50] AutomatedTester: for you and for davehunt
[13:25:53] AutomatedTester: davehunt: you wanted it for proxy right?
[13:26:17] davehunt: AutomatedTester: well tbh either, because I can add proxy to desired_capabilities myself
[13:26:34] davehunt: andreastt: does Opera support proxy yet?
[13:26:37] andreastt: AutomatedTester: What about a new kwarg to webdriver.Browser(…), "log"?
[13:26:42] andreastt: davehunt: Yes.
[13:26:51] davehunt: andreastt: ooh, that's new though, right?
[13:26:52] andreastt: It parses the usual Selenium Proxy JSON object.
[13:26:56] andreastt: Since 0.16.
[13:27:12] davehunt: nice, so I need desired_capabilities in OperaDriver too :D
[13:27:24] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I will give you desired_capabilities

Currently I wrap a condition to check the hidden input for a change, however I sometimes get a StaleElementReferenceException in the wait line? Any suggestions?
[18:33:26] kennethkoontz: I wrap a WebDriverWait around the condition, that is.

[20:39:00] empal: hi anybody know how to change internet explorer's locale through webdriver?
[20:41:05] barancev: santiycr1: yt?
[20:43:51] santiycr1: barancev:  here
[20:44:41] barancev: santiycr: we still struggling with unexplained test failures, like this one: https://saucelabs.com/jobs/550fdfb3a8ab4458985b302946f398bd
[20:44:53] barancev: what's happening to the browser?
[20:45:07] barancev: locally all works well
[20:45:22] JackDandy has joined #selenium
[20:45:25] barancev: but fails in the cloud
[20:45:44] santiycr: selenium never responds to the request
[20:45:59] santiycr: as if it got stuck
[20:46:07] santiycr: after 300 seconds, sauce gives up on selenium responding
[20:46:08] jab416171|Cloud has joined #selenium
[20:46:14] santiycr: and fails the command
[20:47:01] santiycr: barancev: a good way to investigate would be using Sauce Breakpoints
[20:47:15] santiycr: start the test, then go interrupt it by hand and get your hands in the browser
[20:47:44] barancev: can we at least get info from the firefox console log?
[20:50:14] santiycr: barancev, let me run this once and give you a live vnc that you can look at
[20:50:23] santiycr: do you have access to the selenium-ci account on sauce?
[20:51:11] barancev: I have api key, not the credentials
[20:52:47] jimevans: empal: you don't.
[20:53:59] barancev: santiycr: another issue: https://gist.github.com/3839428 -- this single test fail, here is the log: https://gist.github.com/3839298
[20:54:47] santiycr: I see
[20:55:25] santiycr: so, you need the password to get into the selenium-ci account
[20:55:35] santiycr: once you do, you can view and interrupt jobs while they are runnning
[20:55:45] santiycr: then play around with the browser by hand
[20:55:51] santiycr: and figure out why it's stuck
[20:56:00] santiycr: access the firefox console and everything 
[20:56:19] santiycr: barancev:  do you have your own sauce account?
[20:56:29] santiycr: I can give you minutes to debug this
[20:56:40] santiycr: and you can just run the test using different credentials
[20:57:01] barancev: santiycr: yes, I have a maitr'd account
[20:59:22] santiycr: cool
[20:59:33] empal: jimevans: thanks.  so people doing localization testing will need to setup different machines each with different locale settings?  but can I even identify what locale each node is for?
[20:59:56] santiycr: barancev:  have you seen this?

[IRC logfile - Started Fri Oct 12 21:00:04 2012]
[21:00:04] santiycr: you can programatically interrupt tests
[21:00:05] jimevans: empal: not through webdriver, sorry.
[21:00:15] santiycr: (you can also do it by hand, with the "breakpoint" button)
[21:00:28] santiycr: then you can access the firefox error console, selenium log and all that stuff
[21:01:04] empal: jimevans: oh no... thanks anyways

[22:01:51] jleyba: are we anywhere close to releasing 2.26?
[22:07:13] jimevans: we are some distance away. i've run tests against firefox 15 and 16 on windows using native events, but we need both native and synthetic events test results for all other firefox versions we support.
[22:08:15] jimevans: our ci tests are grossly broken for firefox native events. barancev is investigating that

[22:09:12] jimevans: i'll gladly take volunteers to run those tests on monday and report back.
[22:09:33] jimevans: jleyba: in other news, i sent you a code review (http://codereview.appspot.com/6666045/) concerning synthetic keyboard events.
[22:10:26] jimevans: i'd appreciate it if you could take a look. it will affect primarily safari, ghostdriver, and IE with synthetic events.
[22:11:11] jimevans: dawagner: ^^ you too, if you're so inclined.
[22:11:58] jimevans: but for now, i've got to run. see everybody monday.

[23:06:25] Ardesco: Dude-X: I am already waiting, the element is there it is just getting redrawn as I find it and click it occasionally.  It's most annoying
[23:06:34] Ardesco: frigging google maps apps
[23:16:09] dawagner: Ardesco: You really don't want to automate google maps
[23:16:44] Ardesco: it's certainly been tricky
[23:16:52] Ardesco: we have some pretty stable stuff atm though :)
[23:17:22] Ardesco: just the occasional stale element exception about once every 40 runs atm
[23:17:39] Ardesco: annoyingly, in the bit that isn't google maps related
