[11:35:31] simonstewart: deanclkclk: that's really a programming question, but I'd use either properties files or something like Guiceberry

[11:37:14] simonstewart: Then use an environment variable to pick between them. Or another properties file

[12:35:06] barancev: I have gcc, sure, why it fails?
[12:36:28] deanclkclk: simonstewart: so my setup is for localhost right. When I push to Continous Integration...I could set the environmental variable there as well?
[12:37:36] simonstewart: Well, that depends on where your selenium server is running, and where you app is deployed to
[12:38:47] deanclkclk: so when selenium server and selenium java is in the project classpath
[12:38:59] deanclkclk: so when I push to CI....CI Jenkins run the test
[12:39:17] deanclkclk: the test is dependent on the environmental variable
[12:39:29] deanclkclk: so I am saying if it could be setup there
[12:39:29] simonstewart: Time to step back and think a little
[12:39:32] deanclkclk: on the CI server
[12:39:37] deanclkclk: huh?

[12:40:08] barancev: ok, I know, it wants g++ not gcc
[12:40:16] simonstewart: So: when running in jenkins, where is the app deployed?
[12:40:25] simonstewart: And where is selenium running?
[12:40:35] simonstewart: Does your test start everything up?
[12:41:58] deanclkclk: well the application is deployed on the same server
[12:42:26] deanclkclk: the selenium test is running  on the same server as Jenkins
[12:44:00] simonstewart: OK. So everything is on the same machine?
[12:44:10] simonstewart: Why not just stick with "localhost"?
[12:45:43] deanclkclk: yeah sure...but, the machine will need an environmental variable...same like the one I have on the dev machine

[12:56:34] barancev: and I'll write it down to the wiki
[12:57:50] barancev: simonstewart: btw, why getSessionId is not in WebDriver interface?
[12:58:08] simonstewart: Because not all webdrivers are remote
[12:58:14] simonstewart: The session id is an implementation detail
[12:59:00] barancev: but we can demand they provide a session id even if they are not remote
[12:59:14] barancev: session != remote session
[12:59:32] Karol_123 has joined #selenium
[12:59:40] simonstewart: In that case they can just hold the web driver instance

[13:01:13] NeptuNooo has joined #selenium
[13:01:19] simonstewart: "not uniform"?
[13:01:35] barancev: a session if provided by the driver itself would be a better way to identify them
[13:01:40] barancev: a session id
[13:01:58] simonstewart: But the session id is just an artefact of the way we've implemented remoting
[13:02:00] barancev: no matter whether it is remote or not
[13:02:43] simonstewart: But it only makes sense in the remote case
[13:02:50] barancev: it's also an artifact that allows tracking events (logging for example)
[13:02:50] simonstewart: In the local case, it's meaningless
[13:03:10] barancev: if you have several drivers that work in parallel it makes sense
[13:03:10] simonstewart: There are other mechanisms for tracking events
[13:03:17] simonstewart: No. It doesn't
[13:03:24] simonstewart: It makes sense for your test to coordinate this stuff
[13:03:35] simonstewart: But using a random session id off some object in that test
[13:04:00] simonstewart: is just as bad as using the primary key of a table as a key for an exposed object
[13:04:09] simonstewart: It's convenient, but it's a recipe for disaster
[13:04:26] barancev: why? what disaster?
[13:04:49] barancev: why it's a bad practice?
[13:04:59] simonstewart: You're deliberately making your abstraction leaky, and preventing your ability to make optimisations in the future
[13:05:06] simonstewart: (e.g.: change how the PK is generated)
[13:05:20] NeptuNooo: It's boring when i always have to create webdriver instance in order to check if it sends keys (or to check if it clicks on something). Is it possible to simulate webdriver methods (e.g. Webelement.sendkeys("something")  ), using e.g browser firebug console ?  (directly from opened browser)
[13:06:09] barancev: NeptuNooo: use interactive console (irb, groovy, python), open the browser and interact with it
[13:06:47] NeptuNooo: <barancev> could you add 2 sentences more ? 
[13:07:19] barancev: run irb, create a new driver from the console and assign it to a variable -- the browser starts
[13:07:30] barancev: use this variable to send commands to the browser
[13:07:42] NeptuNooo: thank you v. much !
[13:07:52] barancev: ot do the same in python console or groovy console (if you prefer java)

[15:01:23] barancev: how can I debug it?

[15:04:27] selbot2: http://illicitonion.com/selogs/selenium/2012/10/18.txt | http://illicitonion.com/selogs/search
[15:07:12] eranm: barancev, what do you mean remotely?
[15:07:27] eranm: Through the remote WebDriver server?
[15:07:52] barancev: yes, RemoteWebDriver to a selenium server that runs on a linux machine
[15:08:13] eranm: barancev, the good news are that there is a log. But you have to recompile to get it: edit cpp/linux-specific/x_ignore_nofocus.c and uncomment the '#define DEBUG_PRINTOUTS'
[15:08:34] eranm: Then you'll get the logs from the x_ignore_nofocus library, which is probably where the crash is happening
[15:08:52] eranm: if you want to confirm that attach gdb (gdb -p `pidof firefox-bin`) after you have started the test and Firefox is up
[15:09:10] eranm: what I'd do is add a 30 seconds sleep in the test after Firefox starts-up , so you'll have time to attach
[15:09:18] barancev: and where to look for logs?
[15:09:19] eranm: so when Firefox crashes you could type 'bt' into gdb and see the backtrace
[15:09:34] eranm: /tmp/x_ignore_focus_log.txt

[18:39:46] lukeis: fasta: 'we' do :)
[18:40:06] lukeis: seleniumhq.org is what I assume you are talking about
[18:40:11] fasta: lukeis: yes
[18:40:23] fasta: lukeis: you are not providing correct https certificates.
[18:40:52] fasta: lukeis: Go to https://seleniumhq.org/download/ and you will see the epic mess.
[18:41:04] lukeis: site isn't meant to be https
[18:41:20] fasta: lukeis: you are distributing software. How can it _not_ be https?
[18:41:24] lukeis: everything is served without encryption
[18:41:37] lukeis: why does it need to be encrypted?
[18:41:38] fasta: lukeis: do you want to infect the whole world with virusses?
[18:41:40] lukeis: it's all open source
[18:41:45] lukeis: what???
[18:42:00] lukeis: https does not guarantee virus protection in any way
[18:42:18] fasta: lukeis: is there _any_ place where you have signed in a cryptographically secure way the latest release?
[18:42:30] lukeis: seriously... are you for real?
[18:42:46] fasta: lukeis: you apparently are not.
[18:42:54] intuxicated: no idea ?
[18:43:06] fasta: lukeis: what's your background?
[18:43:08] lukeis: intuxicated: "select"? do you mean find and click or are you talking about dropdowns? most likely you just need a webdriverwait
[18:43:15] fasta: lukeis: you sound like someone with a very low education.
[18:43:28] jimevans: fasta: if you're that all-fired worried about the issue, you can compile it from source yourself, ensuring the provenance of the binaries generated.
[18:43:29] fasta: lukeis: ignorant and arrogant.
[18:43:41] fasta: jimevans: that doesn't solve anything.
[18:43:47] intuxicated: lukeis, i mean selecting a element , div , a , whatever 
[18:43:57] fasta: jimevans: unless that comes from a cryptographically signed source.
[18:44:07] lukeis: intuxicated: driver.find_element_by_tag_name("div")
[18:44:10] fasta: Why do I have explain crypto 101 here?
[18:44:54] fasta: to explain*
[18:45:20] fasta: It would be nice if someone could give an _actual_ answer.
[18:45:33] intuxicated: lukeis, if div loaded by ajax or js , is this command able to select this element ?
[18:45:56] lukeis: intuxicated: that's to find the element... what is it you need to do?
[18:46:13] fasta: lukeis: you did _not_ address the issue at hand.
[18:46:26] jimevans: fasta: i don't follow. assume i'm an idiot (which i guess you will anyway). i presume your concern is that the binaries that are available for download from various sites may not be secure, in that they may be altered from what was uploaded to the server. would that be accurate?
[18:47:11] fasta: jimevans: the problem is that something isn't a 'release' until some entity that makes the release has cryptographically signed it.
[18:47:12] lukeis: fasta: our downloads are hosted on google code, which have proper ssl certs: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list    you are rude and I will not talk to you further
[18:47:29] fasta: lukeis: no, they are not.
[18:47:43] fasta: lukeis: the one linked on the main page does not link to a https URL.
[18:48:23] intuxicated: lukeis, yeah that is , problem is , there is some element created in page dynamically, i want to select them
[18:48:41] fasta: jimevans: and building from soruce doesn't help with that, unless that's communicated over a secure channel also.
[18:49:54] fasta: lukeis: I am not rude, you were just trolling.
[18:50:09] lukeis: intuxicated: if that's the case, most likely you'll need to wait for the elements to appear in some way, take a look at this documentation. http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html#explicit-waits
[18:50:14] fasta: lukeis: with which company are you associated?
[18:50:22] fasta: lukeis: I then at least know who to avoid.
[18:51:15] ChanServ has altered lukeis's mode: +o
[18:51:21] fasta: Weak
[18:51:21] jimevans: fasta: i'm not sure i agree with your premise as to what constitutes a "release", but i'm still confused as to how building from the source code, which by definition is text that you can examine to your heart's content, would not be secure enough for you.
[18:51:49] fasta: jimevans: it means I would have to go over all the diffs for every piece of software on my system.
[18:51:58] fasta: jimevans: that's just insanity.
[18:53:25] jimevans: fasta: then how would downloading the library from the https google code site not work? (i know you were asking about seleniumhq.org, but let's leave that aside for a moment) 
[18:53:26] fasta: jimevans: now, if Java had a strong type system, it would have been possible to do this analysis automatically.
[18:53:32] fasta: jimevans: it would.
[18:53:43] fasta: jimevans: that's why I called lukeis a troll.
[18:53:48] jimevans: sounds like we have your answer then.
[18:53:55] fasta: lukeis should just admit that the server configuration is wrong.
[18:54:04] fasta: Because it tries to identify with openqa.org
[18:54:18] fasta: He just doesn't want to do his job properly.
[18:54:26] fasta: Or his 'task', if you will.
[18:54:40] fasta: Instead, he opted to go into asshole mode.
[18:54:54] fasta: That's all fine and perfectly human behaviour, but that doesn't make it right.
[18:55:09] jimevans: well, let's be fair, your tone was a little inflammatory at the outset.
[18:55:49] fasta: jimevans: considering that it's the default link people are expected to use and that this software is used in 10000+ locations in the world, I would say it's a pretty major mistake.
[18:56:20] fasta: jimevans: this is not rocket science anymore.
[18:56:30] fasta: It hasn't been for over 25 years.
[18:59:26] Dude-X__ has joined #selenium
[18:59:59] jimevans: it may be a "major mistake" (i don't concede the point, but i'm not going to argue about it), but there *is* a "secure" place to download the binaries. no, the seleniumhq site doesn't directly point to it; it points to the "insecure" mirror of the same files.

[19:02:47] fasta: jimevans: if it's not intended to be used _at_all_ it should say that the website doesn't exist.
[19:02:57] fasta: jimevans: currently it actually tries to do something.

[19:03:41] fasta: Either you provide a service/url, or you don't. You don't do something in the middle.
[19:03:47] fasta: Why do I have to explain this?
[19:04:29] jimevans: you see? right there. that type of statement. that's what's inflammatory.
[19:05:05] fasta: jimevans: I don't like people who react with bullshit like this out of incompetence.

[19:16:32] fasta: AutomatedTester: sure, I would prefer gpg.
[19:16:45] AutomatedTester: even if I put one in a binary, which I would never do even though you just claimed I do, ssl would protect you
[19:16:54] AutomatedTester: wouldnt
[19:17:14] AutomatedTester: fasta: all SSL does is makes it harder to MITM you
[19:17:25] AutomatedTester: not impossible, just harder
[19:17:30] fasta: AutomatedTester: cryptographically harder, yes.
[19:17:46] fasta: AutomatedTester: it should make it computationally secure.
[19:17:56] KaibutsuX: fasta: so you want to make it harder for crackers to intercept the virus that you think you're intentionaly downloading?
[19:17:57] fasta: AutomatedTester: if it doesn't, please tell me how it doesn't.
[19:18:07] fasta: AutomatedTester: I will then transfer 100B$ from your account to mine.

[19:29:06] fasta: AutomatedTester: I am guessing that you don't understand my statement.
[19:29:27] AutomatedTester: fasta: so you are not saying ssl protects you from viruses?
[19:29:35] fasta: SSL protects you from lots of cases of MITM attacks.
[19:29:56] fasta: I don't see how you can possibly deny that or don't get that.
[19:30:02] AutomatedTester: fasta: I know that, I told you that not a moment ago

[19:32:43] fasta: AutomatedTester: I had responded to that.
[19:32:52] fasta: AutomatedTester: it's supposed to make it computationally _impossible_.

[19:33:05] fasta: AutomatedTester: or rather _intractable_.
[19:33:29] fasta: AutomatedTester: and when that doesn't work, a bank will be the first to fall.
[19:33:43] fasta: AutomatedTester: and not some boring testing tool.
[19:33:52] AutomatedTester: fasta: ok, we agree on that
[19:33:57] fasta: AutomatedTester: as such, your arguments are completely ridiculous.
[19:34:04] AutomatedTester: so why all the angst that we dont do SSL?
[19:34:06] fasta: AutomatedTester: and you argue like a troll.
[19:35:58] fasta: You have basically been saying the logical equivalent of "why should be build a house? Houses can collapse with a probability of 0.0000001%. It's better to sleep in the jungle."

[19:37:41] lukeis: my last and final statement on the matter... sehq has no content that needs to be secure, one could argue the links on the downloads page to google code should be in the form of https... but i don't care enough and someone can submit a patch

[21:07:51] AutomatedTester: sorry I am confusing things and will keep quiet
[21:07:59] AutomatedTester: :)
[21:09:06] detronizator: jimevans: do other atoms generate synthetic "onchange"? 
[21:09:21] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i'm less concerned with the order of the events than that it's firing at all. :)
[21:09:48] jimevans: detronizator: some do. the click atom does for selecting from a <select> element does.
[21:09:48] AutomatedTester: jimevans: i realised and thats why I said I will keep quiet
[21:09:54] AutomatedTester: soz
[21:09:59] jimevans: no worries, mate.
[21:10:11] jimevans: just joshing ya.
[21:10:51] jimevans: detronizator: the challenge with doing it in the atom is that the event doesn't fire until focus is lost on the <input> element, so it'd be really really hard to implement it there.
[21:10:52] AutomatedTester: lol at all the "is github down" messages happening on Mozilla IRC
[21:11:24] detronizator: AutomatedTester: NOW you are disturbing.
[21:11:29] detronizator: :)

[21:15:53] AutomatedTester: right must get this patch done before next meeting
[21:15:54] *jimevans has to decide if he's going to submit a talk this year.
[21:16:01] simonstewart: April, I think
[21:16:03] llaskin: detronizator: april or may

[21:21:22] lukeis: llaskin: yep... my blood boiled... decided to just ignore him would be best
[21:21:45] llaskin: thats a FSET
[21:23:07] AutomatedTester: thats amoray
[21:24:35] AutomatedTester: detronizator: 21:39 <#breakpad> selenamarie: github is experiencing DDoS
[21:24:59] llaskin: wow nice.
[21:25:01] jimevans: detronizator: yeah. it's a simple test. types text into an <input>, clicks on another element to set focus to it, and checks the events fired on the <input>
[21:25:39] jimevans: onchange should fire, but doesn't
[21:26:20] detronizator: if you are with hands into atoms, I'd suggest taking a look at safari or ff atoms for the same stuff, and see if they have to synthetize it
[21:26:30] lukeis: why are idiots DDoS'ing github :-/
[21:26:53] detronizator: otherwise I'll look at it later on: I need to finish this bloody issue with the double eval crashing the hell out of PhantomJS :(
[21:26:57] AutomatedTester: lukeis: the normal reason for a DDoS
[21:27:01] AutomatedTester: just coz
[21:27:21] simonstewart: Right. Time for bed. I'm told. It's not even 10 yet
[21:27:24] jimevans: detronizator: well, neither of those is a good case. safari never went through enough rigor to make sure it passed the tests, and firefox does its own thing.
[21:27:28] detronizator: lukeis: AutomatedTester: I can see simonstewart doing the DDoS as his first task at Facebook
[21:27:35] lukeis: 'night simonstewart

[21:36:48] jimevans: there it is.
[21:38:37] jimevans: AutomatedTester: you'll use tpac as a launch for the spec test suite?
[21:38:59] AutomatedTester: hopefully
[21:39:39] jimevans: looking forward to hearing how the conversations with msft go. feel free to rope me in via irc/skype/whatever.
[21:39:41] lukeis: i'm failing to see how this is a *new* chrome driver? ... or i'm missing something completely ;)
[21:40:00] AutomatedTester: lukeis: the transport mechanism is different
[21:40:12] lukeis: ok
[21:40:21] AutomatedTester: it, like marionette, is going in via the remote debugger
[21:40:28] AutomatedTester: and OperaDriver
[21:40:54] lukeis: cool then ;)
[21:41:23] jimevans: if they can get the "simultaneous debugger clients" issue worked out, man, that'd be something to see.
[21:41:47] llaskin: jarib: i can verify that adb is slow as hell
[21:42:01] chrisculver701: jimevans: your latest submission should allow multiple ie's on the same machine correct?
[21:42:28] jimevans: multiple IEs have been allowed on the same machine for awhile. now you can just start them on multiple threads.
[21:42:28] AutomatedTester: lukeis: adb is flaky realy
[21:42:57] chrisculver701: ah! thats good news for me! I run my drivers on seperate threads
[21:43:00] lukeis: AutomatedTester: i think you mean llaskin  ;)
[21:43:01] jimevans: chrisculver701: though i've heard tell there may be some challenges with session cookies.

[21:59:11] jimevans: detronizator: that's perfectly fair.
[21:59:16] detronizator: it's a "sort of" corner case that can be addressed later

[22:05:47] jimevans: that's okay. i feel pretty confident that the work i'm doing with the .NET binding will get you a long way toward a working, test-passing driver in the webdriver project.
[22:06:08] jimevans: we'll already know what tests need to be "ignored" in the java bindings.
[22:06:11] sbat: they are heavily ajax
[22:07:47] adamgoucher: my guess is that you need to figure out the custom way corda says 'done' and hang off of that
[22:08:47] sbat: its acts as if sel/webdriver is interfering with the 'done' that corda is looking for. once selenium times out, i can see the page render right before the browser closes

[22:11:38] adamgoucher: from here its looking like they are flash
[22:11:56] jimevans: detronizator: fyi, with the commit i'm about to make to webdriver's .net tests, ghostdriver passes at 96.32%. i'm ignoring the alerts tests at the moment. i've also ignored other tests that are not valid for ghostdriver, or that are ignored for non-firefox browsers.
[22:13:33] sbat: adamgoucher: that example is definitely flash
[22:13:35] detronizator: jimevans: that makes me cry of joy almost :)
