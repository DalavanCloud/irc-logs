[03:37:47] vart: I have a problem with getWindowHandles in IE9, it always returns only 1 window, I am running latest Selenium 2.0 with latest IEDriver
[03:38:14] vart: works correctly with ChromeDriver, also tried calling getWindowHandles twice, add delays etc, still returns only 1
[03:39:16] vart: I have different protected mode on different zones and can't change it, which might be the root cause, but can't find any workaround, everything except getWindowHandles works, also both Selenium initialize and actual website is in local zone with off protected mode

[09:16:07] m0dE: Hello?
[09:16:14] m0dE: Anyone here using Webdriver in python?
[09:17:34] m0dE: The Selenium webdriver documentation says there's function is_clickable()
[09:18:07] timothy: Hi, trouble with WebDriver. driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id=\"test_LOG_IN_OUT\"]/..")).click(); gives ElementNotVisibleException but if I give the xpath without using child element (test_LOG_IN_OUT) it works fine..
[09:19:00] m0dE: thanks timothy. I'll look try this
[09:20:52] girija has left #selenium
[09:22:08] m0dE: Question... how would I point to the element without using the child element?

[09:33:25] barancev: m0dE: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/py/genindex.html -- there is no is_clickable
[09:33:47] timothy: It's not displayed if I use xpath through child element with id (test_LOG_IN_OUT\..), but it is displayed if I use full xpath
[09:34:42] barancev: timothy: can you give a link to a pege where this can be observed?
[09:37:21] timothy: Afraid not, closed testing environment
[09:39:41] m0dE: Thanks barancev. I suppose http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html is showing incorrect information (They say python webdriver has is_clickable())
[09:40:07] barancev: yes, it's outdated a bit, read ther API docs

[14:39:33] jimevans: detronizator: and how about you
[14:39:42] detronizator: jimevans: 
[14:39:43] detronizator: hey
[14:40:50] jimevans: detronizator: i don't know if you can do this, but you might want to pick up my mongoose utf-8 pull request for your phantomjs branch. i don't know if/when ariya will get around to merging it into trunk.
[14:41:32] detronizator: I can definitely do that: dod you file a issue in phantomjs issue tracker?
[14:41:44] jimevans: yep. one sec, i'll get the link.
[14:41:46] detronizator: issue one if you didn't, and submit toward my branch the pull req
[14:42:00] detronizator: mentionin and linking the issue in the issue tracker in the commit message
[14:42:51] jimevans: detronizator: http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=809
[14:43:35] detronizator: cool, than you are half way there :)
[14:44:50] jarib: jimevans: yep
[14:45:03] jimevans: jarib: one sec.
[14:46:32] jimevans: detronizator: okay, just replicated the pull request to your branch. :)
[14:47:05] detronizator: I suggest you close the one against ariya's one, to avoid collision/confusion
[14:47:15] detronizator: and mention it's going to come from my branch
[14:47:19] detronizator: so that we are all on the same page
[14:47:24] detronizator: thanks :)
[14:47:43] jimevans: jarib: so i don't know if you saw jarmo's email about running watirspec vs. ghostdriver. i'd like to replicate the experiment using the latest ghostdriver/phantomjs sources. i think we've already gotten some of the issues fixed.

[14:48:02] jarib: ok
[14:49:27] _md has joined #selenium
[14:50:28] jimevans: jarib: so i need some guidance on how to make that happen.
[14:51:00] jimevans: i don't run the watirspec tests often enough to remember how to get that done without assistance. :)
[14:51:38] jimevans: detronizator: pull request completely transferred to your phantomjs ghostdriver-dev branch. :)
[14:52:00] jarib: jimevans: git clone https://github.com/watir/watir-webdriver.git && cd watir-webdriver && git submodule update --init && bundle install && WATIR_WEBDRIVER_BROWSER=remote WATIR_WEBDRIVER_REMOTE_URL=http://ghostdriver/ bundle exec rake spec
[14:52:23] jimevans: (including closed out against ariya's phantomjs master branch)'
[14:52:23] detronizator: jarib: quite a mouthful :)
[14:52:43] detronizator: jimevans: perfect - will get on that later today
[14:52:44] jimevans: jarib: aha. that'll do it, i suppose.
[14:52:52] jarib: are you running this on windows?
[14:53:15] jimevans: yeah, i will be. i don't have to do it all in one command line. i can break it up. 
[14:53:58] jarib: right. probably can't do env vars like that on windows
[14:54:58] AutomatedTester has joined #selenium

[14:55:24] jimevans: need a bundler gem installed?
[14:55:30] jarib: yeah
[14:55:41] jarib: that's the only gem you need preinstalled. `gem install bundler` should do the trick.
[14:55:55] jimevans: yep. getting it now.
[14:56:18] jimevans: watirspec in this mode expects the remote server (ghostdriver in this case) to already be running?
[14:56:24] jimevans: if yes, on what port?
[14:56:50] AutomatedTester: andreastt: pong
[14:56:54] jarib: jimevans: whatever you specify in WATIR_WEBDRIVER_REMOTE_URL
[14:57:01] jimevans: roger that.

[15:01:31] andreastt: AutomatedTester: How would I go about setting up a development environment using virtualenv for the Python bindings?
[15:02:13] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Or is there a better way?
[15:02:42] AutomatedTester: andreastt: crazy-fun does a virtualenv for you
[15:03:17] Automate_ has joined #selenium
[15:03:41] andreastt: Okay, so let's say I have a test.py somewhere on my system I want to run against the development sources in ~/dev/selenium, how would I go about that?
[15:03:42] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[15:04:25] AutomatedTester: andreastt: you would need to set the PYTHONPATH=~/dev/selenium
[15:05:41] AutomatedTester: andreastt: or... create a virtualenv with virtualenv foo
[15:05:43] AutomatedTester: cd foo
[15:05:48] AutomatedTester: . bin/activate
[15:05:56] AutomatedTester: cd ~/dev/selenium

[15:06:46] andreastt: So I tried `pip -e svn+https://code.google…#egg=selenium` which sort of worked, apart from there being no setup.py.
[15:06:53] andreastt: Okay, I'll try that.
[15:06:59] jimevans: jarib: getting the following errors https://gist.github.com/3812073
[15:07:10] AutomatedTester: andreastt: if Selenium were your average python project I would work to make that work
[15:07:17] AutomatedTester: but it isnt
[15:08:25] jimevans: jarib: okay, got it running without the pretty html output.
[15:08:56] rpereira has joined #selenium
[15:10:15] jarib: jimevans: odd. you can also do: `bundle exec rspec -I lib:spec --format html --out results.html spec`

[15:10:44] andreastt: AutomatedTester: But if I make changes to a file, I'll need to do ./go py_install again?
[15:11:14] AutomatedTester: andreastt: if you make changes to the python bindings then yes
[15:11:15] jimevans: jarib: i'll try that.
[15:11:21] andreastt: Well, that sucks.
[15:11:22] AutomatedTester: andreastt: what are you trying to do?
[15:11:32] andreastt: I'm trying to set up a development environment for working on the bindings.
[15:12:16] AutomatedTester: andreastt: how would install be different to creating a jar all the time
[15:12:46] AutomatedTester: andreastt: why not create a test and then just do ./go test_py method=new_test_name
[15:12:58] andreastt: When you compile Java programs you typically don't create JAR's every time.
[15:13:25] AutomatedTester: andreastt: then do PYTHONPATH=~/dev/selenium
[15:13:33] AutomatedTester: andreastt: then do PYTHONPATH=~/dev/selenium/py 
[15:13:34] AutomatedTester: even
[15:14:13] AutomatedTester: andreastt: but then the dependencies might not have been done
[15:14:13] jimevans: jarib: running successfully now. will report back with results when done.

[15:20:57] AutomatedTester: andreastt: its probably picking up the pyc file

[16:50:33] lukeis: heh, that's what they all say ;)

[16:52:31] lukeis: ang3lfir3: just so you know, when trying to get tests working cross browser you'll encounter many places that you need to add extra waits that you didn't need in another browser... also locators may need to be refined :)
[16:53:22] ang3lfir3: lukeis: it seems that our waiting is one issue... 
[16:53:49] lukeis: WebDriverWait / ExpectedConditions are your friend :)
[16:54:45] ang3lfir3: we wrote some wrappers to wait for longer periods and use try-catches  etc .... to try and make them as cross browser as possible.... it all worked fine with ie8 document mode... I changed the X-UA-Compatible meta tag to include IE9 and ... bang
[16:55:25] lukeis: ok :)  if you can provide a reproducible test case we'll likely be able to assist you

[18:53:54] lukeis: oh, that can be fun ;) but I have written my own... so might be able to help there
[18:54:14] jleyba: FluentWait had  "public FluentWait<T> ignoreAll(Collection<Class<? extends RuntimeException>> types)"
[18:54:29] jleyba: that was changed to "public FluentWait<T> ignoreAll(Collection<Class<? extends Throwable>> types)"
[18:54:57] jleyba: which isn't backwards compatible with the old signature
[18:55:31] jleyba: The best I can come up with is
[18:55:47] jleyba: public <S extends Throwable> FluentWait<T> ignoreAll(Collection<Class<? extends S>> types)
[18:56:03] jleyba: a) that's terrifying b) I'm not sure if it's right
[18:56:15] DanC__: right in what sense?
[18:56:29] jimevans: interesting. doesn't RuntimeException derive from Throwable?
[18:56:31] dawagner: What's wrong with leaving it as is? (Apart from the fact that it's not backward compatible)
[18:57:07] jleyba: It requires me to touch a lot of other people's code I'd rather not have to touch :)
[18:57:34] dawagner: sed is your friend
[18:58:28] lukeis: RuntimeException extends Throwable... so I'm not sure how this is breaking something
[18:58:57] lukeis: (like jimevans said...)
[18:58:58] dawagner: lukeis: Because java type bounds are a bitch.
[18:59:06] dawagner: *Usages* of ignoreAll will work fine with both
[18:59:22] dawagner: Places where people override it will break horribly at compile time
[18:59:28] lukeis: ah
[18:59:34] jleyba: ImmutableList<Class<? extends RuntimeException>> ignoredTypes = ImmutableList.of(RuntimeException.class);
[18:59:42] dawagner: With an error message along the lines of ("<>>>><<< ?????<<<>>><>????EXCEPTION?><<<<")
[18:59:49] jleyba: ^ that cannot be passed as an argument to ignoreAll(Collection<? extends Throwable>>)

[19:00:18] jleyba: I hate type erasure so much
[19:00:43] dawagner: Hey! C# doesn't do type erasure and they had this problem until version 4!
[19:01:05] jleyba: I guess it's still better than a C++ template where you could end up with a 3 page compiler error message
[19:01:22] dawagner: <3 STL
[19:01:25] DanC__: 3 page... heh... I ran into that in scala too.
[19:01:49] DanC__: "error in <... a bunch of code that I didn't even write; the compiler made it up>"
[19:02:43] DanC__: meanwhile, the horrible version seems like a solution to the various constraints. "hard cases make bad law" or something like that.
[19:08:35] lukeis: jleyba / dawagner after looking at that class... why aren't we just doing Collection<Throwable> types ... i see no good reason to be doing <? extends Throwable>
[19:10:52] DanC__: I tried making a tiny test to reproduce my alert() problem; no joy. In an isolated test, I get ... WebDriverException: Message: u'Modal dialog present'

[22:20:19] Dude-X: before passing that element to a function
[22:22:24] selenium2user: its a button element
[22:23:00] selenium2user: and am passing it to another funciton.. to be worked on.. 
[22:23:14] selenium2user: wait funciton? 
[22:23:16] selenium2user: function*
[22:25:00] lukeis: WebDriverWait
[22:25:28] lukeis: typically you wait when you're finding the element to make sure your page is fully loaded / the dom isn't being transformed by javascript
[22:26:51] selenium2user: this is the seq of the test steps.. 
[22:27:01] selenium2user: I find the webelement.. 
[22:27:05] selenium2user: make sure its present.. 
[22:27:19] selenium2user: once confirmed.. using "Displayed" property.. 
[22:27:27] noahsussman has joined #selenium
[22:27:35] selenium2user: then i pass the elem to a fun that uses JS script to highlight the elem
[22:27:54] selenium2user: then i use the elem to click 
[22:28:49] lukeis: stale reference on the click? or?
[22:28:51] selenium2user: and i am using selenium 2 with remotewebdriver
[22:29:16] selenium2user: staleref when trying to run the JS script in the func
[22:30:18] lukeis: ok... there's a possibility your finding the element on the previous page (if you just clicked something and then found the element). Sometimes the same locators exist on the previous page and thus you can get in this situation
[22:31:19] selenium2user: hmm this all is happening on a elem on a popup 
[22:32:09] lukeis: can you provide any steps to reproduce your issue? (have a public site / url?)
[22:33:02] selenium2user: the website is on our internal staging env.. 
[22:33:59] lukeis: hmm, ok, well you likely have a timing issue of something reloading in the page
[22:35:29] Dude-X: selenium2user: use firediff with firebug on firefox
[22:35:58] Dude-X: see what kind of dom changes happens as you interact with that button
[22:37:10] selenium2user: could it be possible that by the time the elem is done passing to the func.. the popup changes 
[22:37:24] selenium2user: hmm good idea.. let me try
[22:37:25] selenium2user: thx
