[01:19:05] holybit: the shop I am at currently has a fair amount of RC tests that are run in serial against firefox on vms. the test suite is bailed togther with a simple shell script - not pretty but works. We want to move to Web Driver. Most of the devs are PHP heads, but some perl and java folks are about, but few and far between. What would be the ideal language to use for running our tests if we could port everything over to WD? Given our skill set what's best?
[01:20:49] Eleccy has joined #selenium
[01:26:16] Dude-X_: holybit, probably Java otherwise Python/Ruby
[01:27:17] holybit: Dude-X_: Java was my suspicion as best choice, although I fear the web dev crowd will balk and claim they can't maintain it let alone figure it out
[01:27:34] holybit: of the other two do you have a fav?

[14:35:04] barancev: jimevans: so it is a bad test, then?
[14:35:41] jimevans: barancev: define "bad". it's valid in that it verifies that you can find an element by xpath in a frame/iframe.

[14:37:50] AutomatedTester: llaskin: its a test runner
[14:38:01] barancev: why not?
[14:38:29] barancev: "is there really much point to use Cucumber?" would be a better question
[14:38:30] jimevans: barancev: i'm kidding.
[14:38:41] barancev: selenium or not selenium is irrelevant
[14:38:53] barancev: either you like gerkin or not
[14:39:10] llaskin: barancev: ok
[14:39:12] llaskin: answer that question.
[14:39:17] llaskin: is there really much point to using it?
[14:39:30] barancev: llaskin: me? I see no benefits
[14:39:43] AutomatedTester: but but its like github, all the cool kids use it
[14:40:08] barancev: "table programming" is not for me, i prefer "real languages"
[14:40:18] jimevans: llaskin: if you believe strongly in "plain language" tests, and the given-when-then syntax, then, yes, there's a benefit.
[14:40:24] barancev: but some people like it
[14:40:44] barancev: (despite the fact that you have to code fixtures and steps)
[14:41:51] jimevans: if i wanted to run firefox tests, on linux, using the go build script, with native events enabled, how would I do that?
[14:42:24] Androidnewbe: also each time i run firefox on mack i have to install firebug
[14:42:36] Androidnewbe: wierd
[14:42:49] AutomatedTester: Androidnewbe: webdriver doesnt have that dependency
[14:42:55] llaskin: jim thats sorta my thought
[14:43:10] AutomatedTester: jim does ./go -T tell you?
[14:43:28] Androidnewbe: no no it nor related im just sayin in case any one is using mac with firefox here
[14:43:35] Androidnewbe: maybe someone knows why
[14:43:43] AutomatedTester: Androidnewbe: I use that all the time
[14:43:49] AutomatedTester: and it doesnt install Firebug
[14:43:54] Androidnewbe: on mac ?
[14:43:57] AutomatedTester: yes
[14:44:08] smccarthy: llaskin: I've always considered cucumber for people who dont program. Where the developers write the code, and other people who can't program use cucumber to write the tests.
[14:44:11] AutomatedTester: Androidnewbe: webdriver doesnt have that dependency
[14:44:19] llaskin: smccarthy: so basically, a great tool for product people
[14:44:21] llaskin: not a great tool for devs
[14:44:29] smccarthy: llaskin: in my eyes, yes
[14:44:38] llaskin: thats how i felt
[14:44:41] llaskin: just got asked if i knew it
[14:44:49] llaskin: and was like "well i get it, but don't understand its purpose"
[14:44:58] smccarthy: haha oh, yea
[14:45:46] Androidnewbe: but im not even talkim about dirive i just want to open firefox in separate window to see the code but each time i do that i need to install it
[14:45:49] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i can get how to run firefox tests, but not native events from ./go -T
[14:46:01] Androidnewbe: becaus i cannot find it

[14:57:24] barancev: can you?
[14:58:17] Androidnewbe: well it is hard to say because i  think palceholder is on top of it an once the place holder is clicked the input is becaming visible
[14:59:00] barancev: Androidnewbe: click the placeholder, than, act like a real user
[14:59:23] Androidnewbe: i now  can click on palce holder but in other browser there is no place holder and i don't want to have differetn test depending on the browser

[15:00:03] Androidnewbe: is't a hack to acheave certain look
[15:00:10] Androidnewbe: firefox does not require it
[15:00:19] barancev: Androidnewbe: hack in code => hack in tests
[15:00:26] Androidnewbe: haha
[15:00:26] bfife: hack the planet
[15:01:06] Androidnewbe: or maybe i can change a style of given element thrugh cappybara ?
[15:01:20] Androidnewbe: and just change its display properties
[15:01:26] Androidnewbe: from the test ?
[15:01:30] Androidnewbe: is that possible ?
[15:01:31] barancev: is hurrican still slowing wires? why sauce jobs don't start?
[15:01:55] barancev: Androidnewbe: isn't it a hack either?
[15:02:20] barancev: Androidnewbe: what do you test, then?
[15:02:22] jimevans: barancev: would be interesting to see if IE now treats opacity the same as "standard" browsers.
[15:02:39] Androidnewbe: well it is but in this case i can have jsut one test 
[15:03:04] jimevans: and that'd be a pretty easy thing to test.
[15:03:06] barancev: Androidnewbe: if you act unlike a user, enabling elements, filling invisible fields, how to interprete results?

[15:04:02] Androidnewbe: i now what you mean but this is just extreem case anyway im not the one who is going to worry about that
[15:04:08] Androidnewbe: i jsut need to make the test work
[15:05:09] Androidnewbe: mabe page.execute_script
[15:05:09] RossPatterson: Androidnewbe: Ain't gonna happen.  WebDriver won't let you click on an element that isn't visible.
[15:05:22] Androidnewbe: shit
[15:05:23] RossPatterson: Oh, that's a BAD idea.
[15:05:29] RossPatterson: You're not really testing the page then.
[15:05:35] Androidnewbe: it wont work with css anyway
[15:05:47] RossPatterson: golly
[15:05:50] barancev: so you have a choice of two hacks -- either browser-specific code, or changing elements visibility with unpredictable result
[15:06:22] barancev: first hack is more straightforward
[15:06:44] Androidnewbe: just hange the test code ?
[15:06:52] Androidnewbe: a click on palce holder first
[15:07:08] barancev: if you have browser specific code in implementation it's hard to expect that test will be browser-agnostic

[16:05:21] jimevans: that would be the changes you were wanting to integrate?
[16:05:42] dawagner: Aha
[16:05:43] dawagner: Yes
[16:05:49] dawagner: We have an opacity change there
[16:05:51] dawagner: Yep

[16:06:18] jimevans: yep, i see it.

[16:06:35] jimevans: that's analogous to the change i was suggesting to make.
[16:06:52] jimevans: so you're a step ahead of me there.
[16:07:23] jimevans: if we could figure out why the alerts tests are failing in sauce for firefox, i'd be much happier.
[16:07:35] jimevans: doesn't look like a remote thing.
[16:07:46] dawagner: I'm confident that the opacity change works - I can cherry pick that in to a commit pre-release, or just commit post-release
[16:07:51] jimevans: or at least i can't get it to fail locally using remotewebdriver.

[16:09:57] jimevans: Androidnewbe: dawagner and i are both committers on the selenium project. he works at google, and they use the project extensively internally, and regularly contribute code back to the open-source version of the project.
[16:10:52] KaibutsuX: jimevans: what happened to monday 2.26?
[16:11:24] jimevans: i thought we could get a fix for a crashing bug in linux for firefox with native events.
[16:11:36] dude-x: KaibutsuX: hurricane sandy happened
[16:11:37] jimevans: we did get a fix for it, but we're still seeing issues with alerts in that same environment.

[16:13:05] jleyba: tries to make hover a persistent action
[16:13:19] jimevans: Nari: provides a hack for IE to try to make hovering over an element persistent if the physical mouse cursor is within the bounds of the IE window.
[16:13:48] Nari: Oh, that's for the refreshing problem ie had so far? 
[16:13:51] jimevans: and make no mistake, it's a hack of the highest degree.
[16:14:08] KaibutsuX: lol
[16:15:07] Nari: jimevans: if the physical mouse cursor is outside, all bets are off? 
[16:15:19] jimevans: Nari: i don't know what you mean by "refreshing problem", but it's described in this blog post - http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/06/whats-wrong-with-internet-explorer.html
[16:15:37] Nari: Okay
[16:15:46] jimevans: Nari: quite the opposite. if the mouse cursor is outside the bounds of the IE window, it works perfectly, every time.

[19:14:54] jimevans: that's fair.
[19:15:28] detronizator: jimevans: btw, thanks A LOT for it
[19:15:37] detronizator: it helps immensely
[19:15:57] jimevans: detronizator: what might be useful is if there were a gradle target for running specific tests.
[19:16:07] jimevans: i don't even know if that's possible
[19:16:20] detronizator: jimevans: sure it must be - gradle is very flexible
[19:16:38] detronizator: jimevans: but what I really want, is to pick the largest set of tests already available and use those

[19:57:42] dude-x: define interactions
[19:58:02] bfife: interacting with pages which do json calls

[19:58:25] dude-x: well that seems IO heavy but parsing json can use a bit of cpu as well

[22:21:03] ignacio_ has joined #selenium
[22:24:13] jarib: Â» is not the same as >>, for one
[22:24:27] Androidnewbe: hmm
[22:24:48] Androidnewbe: good point
[22:26:05] selbot2: 03dawagner half a minute ago - DanielWagnerHall: Actually use the replaced value | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=18038 | http://seleniumhq.org/ci.jsp?r=18038
[22:26:09] Androidnewbe: on the site is the small >> and same in the code
[22:26:27] Androidnewbe: maybe i can strip it to use only 'Next'
[22:26:33] Androidnewbe: with regular expresion
[22:26:50] Androidnewbe: how would i do that ?
[22:27:56] Androidnewbe: if i used a[@href and normalize-space(text()) = 'Next']")); would it stil work give that the text in the element is 'Next Â»' 
[22:28:41] Androidnewbe: can i specify if i want to match  whole words ?
[22:30:36] jarib: google for contains()
[22:31:29] jarib: alternatively, just iterate over the links in java
[22:31:34] jarib: and use getText()
[22:32:01] jarib: or, just grab the last link in the set under .pagination
