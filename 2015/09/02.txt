[2015-09-02 06:33:31] jimevans: No More RC!
[2015-09-02 06:33:55] p_l: I'd laugh more than it's appropriate, but I had to deal with at least one product where I needed to use IDE if only to get the data necessary to write WebDriver-based tests
[2015-09-02 06:34:03] *p_l looks pointedly at SmartClient'
[2015-09-02 06:34:07] davehunt: would anyone here object to me changing the default capabilities for PhantomJS in the Python bindings from DesiredCapabilities.PHANTOMJS to None, and then set sensible defaults within the driver init if cap is None? It would make it consistent with Chrome, Firefox, and IE
[2015-09-02 06:34:56] jimevans: p_l: sorry, i've absolutely no sympathy for people still using Selenium RC. it's been deprecated for something like 4 years now.
[2015-09-02 06:34:57] davehunt: although it looks like Safari driver uses DesiredCapabilities.SAFARI
[2015-09-02 06:35:28] davehunt: hmm.. ditto for Android
[2015-09-02 06:36:41] p_l: jimevans: I don't have sympathy either, it's just that for SmartClient, even with all the hacks I did to make WebDriver testing possible, I still had to use Selenium IDE to get their own brand of locators :D
[2015-09-02 06:37:12] jimevans: as for IDE, blame mozilla for their recent changes in policy for add-ons
[2015-09-02 06:37:31] davehunt: jimevans: samit is looking to get IDE signed and available on AMO again
[2015-09-02 06:37:51] p_l: jimevans: not going to blame them, I'd love to see RC deader than dead
[2015-09-02 06:38:04] p_l: davehunt: oh poo, I thought I was finally going to be rid of it...
[2015-09-02 06:38:12] davehunt: I'm not saying I think that's a good thing :)

[2015-09-02 06:39:18] jimevans: IDE and technologies like it have a very specific use case, for a very specific set of users. there is a need for a project like it. i just don't believe in its mission over the long haul.
[2015-09-02 06:39:40] p_l: davehunt: SmartClient peeps keep on supporting RC over WebDriver, promoting RC in their docs
[2015-09-02 06:39:59] davehunt: p_l: that's going to hurt them

[2015-09-02 06:47:15] Citizenken: i'm trying to install firebug on the firefox headless browser
[2015-09-02 06:48:13] jimevans: setting aside the folly of what a "firefox headless browser" is, you should be able to set the firefox profile as part of the DesiredCapabilities for the driver, and it should get installed.
[2015-09-02 06:48:15] Citizenken: do i just need to specify the path to the XPI in the firefox profile?
[2015-09-02 06:48:39] p_l: davehunt: I'm pondering doing a donation drive to discourage any attempts at signing Selenium RC/IDE
[2015-09-02 06:50:04] jimevans: Citizenken: depending on the language bindings you're using, the FirefoxProfile object should have an addExtension method (or equivalent) where you can specify the path to the XPI.
[2015-09-02 06:50:11] davehunt: p_l: Selenium RC will not be continued, I wouldn't stand against IDE continuing to exist, I just don't recommend it beyond the basics
[2015-09-02 06:50:13] jimevans: then you can add that profile to the DesiredCapabilities.

[2015-09-02 07:22:36] D3M0S: it's a pretty good format to get people to give talks that didn't get accepted to the con.

[2015-09-02 14:37:13] jleyba: You are using Selenium 1.0, which is a JavaScript application and relies on the server to act as a proxy

[2015-09-02 15:22:42] computa_mike: hi everyone
[2015-09-02 15:24:17] computa_mike: I'm struggling with Page Object Models.  We're developing an MVC application - so we have a view model object.  This is used to create the page.  And then to interact using selenium with the page, we create a Page Object Model - which seems to implement exactly the same sort of structure.  Anyone had any sucess in using a view model as a page object model?
[2015-09-02 15:24:38] rorycb, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-02 15:25:18] D3M0S: computa_mike, this is pretty familiar, you end up building code that closely mimics the code you test

[2015-09-02 15:26:43] computa_mike: D3MOS , yeah so I thought I'd try using AOP - I wrote an interceptor that allowed you to use the view model - but when you actually ineract with the view model - it calls the interceptor code - which I had set to return hardcoded values - but could equally return values from the page.
[2015-09-02 15:27:15] D3M0S: you might be able to implement a custom Locator factory to scan the View model object and translate those view elements into webelements, but I haven't attempted that, and it would be rather advanced.

[2015-09-02 15:28:36] computa_mike: D3MOS, thanks for the idea.  I just really hate the idea or writing the same code twice.  The advnatage of the inherrited page model is that as soon as it changes it becomes testable straight away.
[2015-09-02 15:28:45] D3M0S: with that you'd kinda end up with a bunch of webelement, which most(including me) would not recommend you use in your tests

[2015-09-02 15:29:16] computa_mike: D3MOS - I just didn;t know if other people had that same issue - that page object models become an almost carbon copy of the viewmodel
[2015-09-02 15:29:30] D3M0S: so you'd still need to write code to interact with those transated view models to control test flow/execution
[2015-09-02 15:30:01] D3M0S: computa_mike, are you going to SeleConf?
[2015-09-02 15:30:26] computa_mike: D3MOS nope - I've only really gotten into selenium this year

[2015-09-02 15:32:07] computa_mike: so - are you presenting at selenium conf?
[2015-09-02 15:32:10] D3M0S: so yeah, check out PageFactory
[2015-09-02 15:32:18] D3M0S: computa_mike, nope, my talk didnt get accepted
[2015-09-02 15:32:36] computa_mike: Pagefactory - i'll fire up google
[2015-09-02 15:32:39] D3M0S: I just don't think theres many users interested in the stack I was wanting to present on
[2015-09-02 15:33:07] computa_mike: what stack was that?
[2015-09-02 15:33:19] D3M0S: Spring/Java/Selenium

[2015-09-02 15:33:56] computa_mike: ah - I'm using c#, Specflow, Selenium
[2015-09-02 15:34:05] D3M0S: I'm working on making Page Objects extreemly dry using DI
[2015-09-02 15:34:36] computa_mike: as I said - I had a go with Ninject (which is a DI framework)
[2015-09-02 15:35:01] computa_mike: it had the potential to work - but I can't get past the challenge of wiring it up to the page
[2015-09-02 15:35:24] computa_mike: Pagefactory seems interesting though

[2015-09-02 15:36:02] D3M0S: computa_mike, because you need PageFactory to do it
[2015-09-02 15:36:03] D3M0S: :)
[2015-09-02 15:36:32] D3M0S: I can paste you some java code, where I wire mine up
[2015-09-02 15:37:03] computa_mike: if you could - that might help
[2015-09-02 15:37:33] computa_mike: i think -i ran off and implemented half of it using DI, and perhaps I should have found this page factory instead

[2015-09-02 15:43:22] D3M0S: computa_mike, so you might not be as interested in the second paste, but that's how I wire Spring TestContext to the Junit Test
[2015-09-02 15:44:16] D3M0S: computa_mike, also in the first paste, you can do that might simpler, but I detect between a Page Object being on an Android Device or Web Page and switch to use that driver accordingly
[2015-09-02 15:44:52] computa_mike: just need to figure out how to cut and past from this chat room - i'm running a windows metro application thing...

[2015-09-02 15:45:34] D3M0S: kinda like @FindBy etc.
[2015-09-02 15:46:06] computa_mike: one of my colleagues was creating page objects with those attributes in there,
[2015-09-02 15:46:30] D3M0S: but it can be someting as simple as accessing your bean post processors and doing PageFactory.initElements(WebDriver, pageBean);

[2015-09-02 15:51:38] computa_mike: I've had a read through your pastes - I'm not 100% sure I follow what they're doing.  but based on one of your previous comments I did find a page about selenium pageFactory obkects for c#...
[2015-09-02 15:52:21] D3M0S: yeah, a lot of that is spring stuff
[2015-09-02 15:52:38] D3M0S: basically in the second paste I show you the annotations I need to pull in the spring configuration
[2015-09-02 15:52:46] D3M0S: and wire that up to a test
[2015-09-02 15:53:15] D3M0S: in the first paste is my spring configuration that wires it up to a test, at this point there is no selenium to speak of
[2015-09-02 15:53:32] D3M0S: other than the fixtures object where I instantiate and store the webdriver object
[2015-09-02 15:54:01] D3M0S: in the 2nd class on the 2nd paste
[2015-09-02 15:54:19] D3M0S: I se springs PageObjectBeanPostProcessor to hook into the bean being called up by the spring container
[2015-09-02 15:54:27] D3M0S: so if I autowire in a page object, it will run this code first
[2015-09-02 15:55:12] D3M0S: when that autowired page object gets called by the container, that post processor will go in an populate all of the fields using page factory
[2015-09-02 15:55:53] D3M0S: so in a test, you can autowire in a page object, and it will be pre-instantiated for you.
[2015-09-02 15:56:45] computa_mike: so- spring creates your page object?(did i get that right?)
[2015-09-02 15:56:45] D3M0S: this same concept chains all the way down page objects as they autowire in new page objects
[2015-09-02 15:56:49] D3M0S: yep

[2015-09-02 15:57:53] computa_mike: but the page object returned is just an object right?
[2015-09-02 15:58:34] D3M0S: computa_mike, http://pastebin.com/isTCmmA4
[2015-09-02 15:58:41] D3M0S: this is an example of one of my page objects
[2015-09-02 15:59:44] D3M0S: so you see how my PageDecorator hook allows me to use that @Decorator annotation on the field, so I can customize what is returned by the element behind the scenes
[2015-09-02 16:00:21] D3M0S: computa_mike, the object returned is a spring bean, which is pretty much just a container enabled object
[2015-09-02 16:00:40] computa_mike: right...
[2015-09-02 16:00:45] D3M0S: the @WebObject annotation at the top signals to spring that it's an autowirable component
[2015-09-02 16:01:43] D3M0S: I guess I should show you what something basic would look like wihtout those fancy decorators

[2015-09-02 16:11:18] computa_mike: but in c# obviously
[2015-09-02 16:12:06] D3M0S: http://pastebin.com/pdfEw2Lm
[2015-09-02 16:12:11] D3M0S: there you go, that has the missing line
[2015-09-02 16:12:46] D3M0S: computa_mike, that's the way I've done things for the past few years
[2015-09-02 16:13:26] computa_mike: I'm wondering if i can move the @findby attribute to the view model, and just use that...
[2015-09-02 16:13:37] computa_mike: what do yo think?
[2015-09-02 16:13:40] D3M0S: now that I'm incharge of my own framework, and the only one writing tests...I'm implementing things that make it easier to write those page objects, I also don't have a view model object to work off of though, so I spend a large amount of time writing very long page objects
[2015-09-02 16:14:08] D3M0S: computa_mike, I wouldn't put test code in production code
[2015-09-02 16:14:20] swampdragons, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-02 16:14:30] computa_mike: yeah - it does seem a bit dodgy
[2015-09-02 16:14:56] D3M0S: I'd write a custom locator to find the fields in the view model and translate those into webelements
[2015-09-02 16:15:39] D3M0S: then write a slimmed down page object that utilizes those translated fields to detect and manipulate the elements as needed for your tests
[2015-09-02 16:16:24] D3M0S: so the thing to know, is that @FindBy etc, are not locators, those are decorators
[2015-09-02 16:16:24] computa_mike: I'll give it a try
[2015-09-02 16:16:25] swampdragons1, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-02 16:17:17] computa_mike: locator would take those attributes and then call appropriate findelements on webdriver?
[2015-09-02 16:17:45] D3M0S: yep
[2015-09-02 16:17:56] D3M0S: maybe translate attributes into a By object
[2015-09-02 16:18:18] D3M0S: then use WebDriver.findElements(By) to find it on the page
