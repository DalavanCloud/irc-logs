[2015-09-18 11:50:24] loa: how i can debug my selenium erorrs? i trie to work with slimerjs
[2015-09-18 11:50:35] loa: i have error when i try to do implicit wait
[2015-09-18 11:51:47] dude-x_: loa: more info please
[2015-09-18 11:52:24] loa: dude-x_, yes i am working on this.
[2015-09-18 11:52:32] dude-x_: well if you are getting an error when you are trying to retrieve an element that is fetched by a find_element call and it times out, that means there is a lot of javascript there
[2015-09-18 11:52:54] lukeis: don't use implicit waits? :-D
[2015-09-18 11:53:50] Neo--, quitting. (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[2015-09-18 11:57:21] loa: lukeis, i tried explicit too
[2015-09-18 11:57:23] loa: same result
[2015-09-18 11:57:28] loa: dude-x_, lukeis http://pastebin.com/4LdQtiuf
[2015-09-18 11:57:43] loa: looks like something with webdriver protocol
[2015-09-18 11:58:13] lukeis: looks like phantomjs crapped itself :)
[2015-09-18 11:58:18] lukeis: check the ghostdriver.log ?
[2015-09-18 11:58:31] dude-x_: loa: it's returning some message but it's not in json format.
[2015-09-18 11:58:33] dude-x_: which is annoying
[2015-09-18 11:58:52] dude-x_: but it has nothing to do with the standard selenium error messages
[2015-09-18 11:58:59] loa: dude-x_, can i watch that answer?
[2015-09-18 11:59:09] lukeis: i think i need to change the python bindings to spit out the raw result when it's not properly formatted…
[2015-09-18 11:59:33] dude-x_: yeah, i was going to work on that last weekend lukeis but if forgot
[2015-09-18 11:59:37] dude-x_: but i forgot.
[2015-09-18 12:00:15] lukeis: same issue with Microsoft's driver… hard to troubleshoot the failure when we swallow the response
[2015-09-18 12:01:06] dude-x_: basically we need a try: except ValueError: ...
[2015-09-18 12:01:19] lukeis: yep, with a raise
[2015-09-18 12:01:31] loa: so you think i need change source a little?
[2015-09-18 12:01:46] dude-x_: loa: sometihng is going wrong with slimerjs
[2015-09-18 12:01:47] lukeis: not you :)
[2015-09-18 12:02:03] lukeis: loa: did you check the ghostdriver.log file?
[2015-09-18 12:02:10] dude-x_: lukeis: with a raise? i was tihnking of adding a warning that would say "please bug the driver writer to always return JSON"
[2015-09-18 12:02:35] lukeis: warning? huh? the command failed, that should be an exception raised
[2015-09-18 12:02:52] dude-x_: it's already in the error handler
[2015-09-18 12:03:01] jimpurbrick, quitting. (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[2015-09-18 12:03:07] lukeis: no, that's the error handler trying to check if there's an error!
[2015-09-18 12:03:27] dude-x_: I see. usually in the stack trace i see it not matching the error type
[2015-09-18 12:03:35] dude-x_: so i guess it's two cases
[2015-09-18 12:03:49] loa: dude-x_, i run browser in debug mode and it is bloated.
[2015-09-18 12:04:04] dude-x_: bloated?
[2015-09-18 12:04:13] dude-x_: noisy logs?
[2015-09-18 12:04:24] lukeis: this case happens with a response that is typically html and not json :) (like the server replying with it's own 500 error page)
[2015-09-18 12:05:06] dude-x_: lukeis: good point

[2015-09-18 12:05:55] dude-x_: loa: your code looks fine, but something is wrong with the driver/casper
[2015-09-18 12:06:02] loa: dude-x_, there are 7k strings
[2015-09-18 12:06:07] loa: i can post thiem
[2015-09-18 12:06:23] loa: but there nothing special some warning for js in that site
[2015-09-18 12:06:26] dude-x_: lukeis: errorhandler.py seems to be consistent area where json errors occur
[2015-09-18 12:06:36] lukeis: yep
[2015-09-18 12:06:55] loa: that moment that it is that file... looks like error is somewhere else
[2015-09-18 12:07:30] loa: slimerjs have not got webdriver in stable version so maybe right decision to open bug for this in slimerjs?
[2015-09-18 12:07:57] loa: i think it is not waiting that wait for some reason
[2015-09-18 12:08:03] loa: and returning buggy json
[2015-09-18 12:09:27] loa: maybe easier is to debug webdriver proto with wireshark?

[2015-09-18 12:09:46] dude-x_: loa: why not test against a real browser
[2015-09-18 12:10:30] loa: they are heavier
[2015-09-18 12:10:39] loa: i am looking something for data scraping
[2015-09-18 12:11:01] loa: thing that i selected slimerjs because it support flash
[2015-09-18 12:11:52] dude-x_: you script against any flash contenet?
[2015-09-18 12:12:02] dude-x_: you can^
[2015-09-18 12:12:35] loa: what you you can script?
[2015-09-18 12:12:39] loa: mean *
[2015-09-18 12:14:03] dude-x_: you said slimerjs supports flash. can you use webdriver to interact with the flash content?
[2015-09-18 12:15:11] loa: it loads flash right... something like youtube videos. i think you can click there at least
[2015-09-18 12:15:33] dude-x_: chrome can load flash
[2015-09-18 12:15:36] dude-x_: and it's fast.
[2015-09-18 12:17:24] loa: maybe i will move to it
[2015-09-18 12:17:46] loa: i tried to echo json value
[2015-09-18 12:17:51] loa: there is None
[2015-09-18 12:17:57] loa: so error somewhere else
[2015-09-18 12:18:09] spacenomad, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-18 12:18:17] loa: looks like you are right and better give up on this
[2015-09-18 12:18:20] dude-x_: if an element doesn't exist, it will throw a regular NoElementFoundException
[2015-09-18 12:18:30] dude-x_: instead there's osmething wrong on the SlimerJS side.

[2015-09-18 19:31:00] felixn: not sure, you're going to have to dig around!  running selenium-server -debug should help
[2015-09-18 19:34:42] erm3nda: do we talk about standalone server then?
[2015-09-18 19:35:00] erm3nda: the java one
[2015-09-18 19:35:13] erm3nda: I use Firefox() webdriver from Python selenium
[2015-09-18 19:35:22] erm3nda: Maybe is about that. Im not an selenium expert :(
