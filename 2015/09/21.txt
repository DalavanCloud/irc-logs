[2015-09-21 07:05:43] dimacus: has anyone seen issues on IE grid nodes, when a VM is cloned from a template VM, IE10 has issues with NoSuchWindowException
[2015-09-21 07:05:58] dimacus: it's super odd, on base template image it works fine
[2015-09-21 07:06:47] dimacus: but on a clone it acts up… i wonder if there is some GUID or UUID issues that might be colliding

[2015-09-21 09:23:32] titusfor_: is it time to get a selbot command for :ide ?
[2015-09-21 09:24:18] jimevans: if someone would follow up with the selenium builder import, that'd probably help
[2015-09-21 09:24:37] jimevans: but i'm not the one to do it, because i don't believe in the record-playback paradigm
[2015-09-21 09:24:59] titusfor_: is that one supposed to be better record/playback?
[2015-09-21 09:25:39] jimevans: it's more modern, and more closely maps to the webdriver api, iirc, instead of the abomination that is selenium rc (or selenium core, if you're really being pedantic)
[2015-09-21 09:25:48] dude-x: ironically xcode 7's UI Testing framework supports record and playback for iOS and Mac applications
[2015-09-21 09:27:00] jimevans: no irony there. if you're a UI testing framework/library and you *don't* have record-playback capability, it's a mark against you. because snake oil. and "ZOMG! i have to know how to code! oh noes!!"
[2015-09-21 09:27:30] jimevans: which, incidentally, is why selenium IDE hadn't been nuked from orbit
[2015-09-21 09:27:40] dude-x: but it writes Swift code; and i suppose it's a nice to get locators written out for you

[2015-09-21 11:40:57] qwebirc80605: Hi guys, it is my first time here. I am looking for help using selenium webDriver for Firefox within Python... is there anyone who can help me solve an issue?
[2015-09-21 11:42:42] gustester: what's the issue?

[2015-09-21 11:49:54] qwebirc80605: I am able to use Selenium to open a webDriver instance (Firefox), however it will then not respond. It doesn't insert my url nor perform any further actions on the site.

[2015-09-21 11:51:26] qwebirc80605: It was working one minute, then not the next. the exact same script works on Mac OSX just fine, but the issue I described in on Windows 8. Initially occurred with 32-bit Python, I have upgraded to 64-bit and also the same with Firefox (32 to 64 bit). No difference.
[2015-09-21 11:52:40] qwebirc80605: I was using a custom profile and reading that it, and the error message was reading (at timeout) that selenium (or Python itself) was not able to load the profile, however the paths were unchanged from the working script. I have also tried with no custom profile which also isn't working.

[2015-09-21 15:32:18] lukeis: unusual? heh…
[2015-09-21 15:32:36] dude-x_: maybe because i was browsing best buy

[2015-09-21 15:34:15] lukeis: the first and the last legs… trust me, you do not
[2015-09-21 15:34:33] titusfor_: Yeah, getting to the West Coast is... not ideal :)
[2015-09-21 15:34:55] titusfor_: but hey, Highway 1/101 in a convertible...
[2015-09-21 15:35:23] lukeis: LA -> SF along 101 / 1 is quite nice… SF -> portland is pretty too. and even to seattle…. but getting across to austin?! damn… texas is huge in itself and a whole lot of nothing...
[2015-09-21 15:35:31] titusfor_: Also my dog came with me. She loves road trips
[2015-09-21 15:35:48] AutomatedTester: I want to do Vancouver to LA road trip
