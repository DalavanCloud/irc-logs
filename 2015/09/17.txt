[2015-09-17 00:57:35] GforOevOerD: Hi all friends.I want to enter a text into a field and get the length of the field afterwards,but as I enter the words and get length, the legth of the field is 0. I wanted to know how do I in Selenium get the length of a field that I previously entered text but not submitted it? The language I'm using is Python.
[2015-09-17 00:58:08] RedAero: Can't you just get the length of whatever you entered from Python?
[2015-09-17 00:58:29] RedAero: Or do you mean you want to enter text by hand and get the length with Selenium?
[2015-09-17 01:00:00] GforOevOerD: RedAero Thank for guiding me.I have a field and I want to enter text by using .sendkeys() method.At the time, I want to get the len of the field to know how mant characters I have entered.
[2015-09-17 01:00:23] MrCoder, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-17 01:02:54] RedAero: Just use length() on whatever you entered?
[2015-09-17 01:03:21] RedAero: sorry, I mean len()
[2015-09-17 01:04:34] cristi, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-17 01:05:00] GforOevOerD: RedAero Yes I used that and although that there are text in the field, the len(element).text returns 0

[2015-09-17 01:17:04] RedAero: second, of course that doesn't work, an element has no length
[2015-09-17 01:17:28] RedAero: you want len("some text")
[2015-09-17 01:19:59] GforOevOerD: RedAero But element's text attribute contains the text inside the element.
[2015-09-17 01:20:55] RedAero: yeah, but it isn't itself something that has length
[2015-09-17 01:21:20] RedAero: You want the length of the text inside it, what's the problem with len("some text")

[2015-09-17 06:39:35] WhereIsMySpoon: qwebirc51704: if you're new to selenium i recommend using webdriver instead and programming your tests, the IDE is old and outdated
[2015-09-17 06:40:51] qwebirc51704: yes, understood from reading the intro and history. Thought IDE will provide a quicker method to generate some test and understand the script/command b4 I do the programming route w/v2
[2015-09-17 06:41:09] [rahul]: side is bad choice
[2015-09-17 06:41:14] [rahul]: IDE

[2015-09-17 06:41:41] WhereIsMySpoon: qwebirc51704: again I recommend against the IDE
[2015-09-17 06:41:46] WhereIsMySpoon: so will most here
[2015-09-17 06:41:48] [rahul]: Get your hand dirty with running first script in selenium docs
[2015-09-17 06:41:57] qwebirc51704: so, if I were going the programming route, what are the components needed? standalone server + something?
[2015-09-17 06:42:02] [rahul]: Believe me its easy
[2015-09-17 06:42:06] Citizenken, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2015-09-17 06:42:25] [rahul]: You need some libraries with whatever language  you want to use
[2015-09-17 06:42:27] WhereIsMySpoon: to start, just download the selenium server jar and a set of programming bindings and go
[2015-09-17 06:42:34] WhereIsMySpoon: that will let u run on firefox at least
[2015-09-17 06:42:45] WhereIsMySpoon: if u wanna run on IE or chrome then u need to download the drivers for those
[2015-09-17 06:43:06] WhereIsMySpoon: qwebirc51704: use google :) will help u get set up
[2015-09-17 06:43:10] WhereIsMySpoon: many guides out there
[2015-09-17 06:43:20] qwebirc51704: ok, just the .jar? don't I need to do something like set the class path etc?
[2015-09-17 06:43:54] qwebirc51704: I got the server + java + JS bindings
[2015-09-17 06:44:05] qwebirc51704: but not "installed" yet
[2015-09-17 06:44:12] WhereIsMySpoon: nothing needs to be "installed"
[2015-09-17 06:44:53] [rahul]: easy way..install eclipse..see tutorial how to set up web driver in eclipse..run programs
[2015-09-17 06:45:20] WhereIsMySpoon: for java sure...for JS eclipse isnt that good

[2015-09-17 06:49:06] qwebirc51704: I saw this: "You may, or may not, need the Selenium Server, depending on how you intend to use Selenium-WebDriver. If you will be only using the WebDriver API you do not need the Selenium-Server. If your browser and tests will all run on the same machine, and your tests only use the WebDriver API, then you do not need to run the Selenium-Server; WebDriver will run the browser directly."
[2015-09-17 06:49:26] qwebirc51704: so sounds like I only need the web driver

[2015-09-17 12:23:36] michl68, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-17 12:24:05] Ardesco: and the language bindings for ghostdriver are whatâ€™s written in java(or groovy)
[2015-09-17 12:24:33] titusfor_: phantomjs has a bunch of different implementations - http://phantomjs.org/related-projects.html
[2015-09-17 12:25:41] loa: how i can debug js code which run from flash as3?

[2015-09-17 12:26:44] jleyba: So looks like phantomjs may be alive and kicking, but ghostdriver is unmaintained
[2015-09-17 12:26:48] loa: i need something to start learning.
[2015-09-17 12:27:01] Ardesco: basically

[2015-09-17 12:29:01] Ardesco: *or
[2015-09-17 12:29:26] barancev: because JS engine is important
[2015-09-17 12:29:26] jleyba: Ardesco, I agree. It uses a crappy JS engine
[2015-09-17 12:29:28] Ardesco: also it has some wierd errors with modern file upload controls
[2015-09-17 12:29:37] jleyba: But users love it for some reason
[2015-09-17 12:29:40] Ardesco: and itâ€™s not thread safe

[2015-09-17 12:30:14] Ardesco: itâ€™s easier to get phantom up and running than it is to install Xvfb in some peoples minds i guess
[2015-09-17 12:30:26] Ardesco: pain in the arse to debug tests that donâ€™t work though

[2015-09-17 12:33:18] *AutomatedTester mutters'
[2015-09-17 12:33:46] jleyba: reasoning for `` for template strings is probably similar to // for regex

[2015-09-17 12:35:39] jleyba: new breed of js programmers are infected with coffee script nonsense and can't be bother to type a few extra letters
[2015-09-17 12:35:42] Ardesco: you have to think functional programming AutomatedTester, why have String.format() when you can have i>>#!o
[2015-09-17 12:35:57] Ardesco: ;)
[2015-09-17 12:36:05] AutomatedTester: (à² _à² )
[2015-09-17 12:36:16] jleyba: arrow functions lead to more condensed (i.e. harder to read) code
[2015-09-17 12:36:27] jleyba: in my, ever aging, get-off-my-lawn opinion
[2015-09-17 12:36:42] AutomatedTester: I find that with promises

[2015-09-17 12:38:03] titusfor_: The only use case I've seen for phantomjs is if you are running your tests on centos or something without proper browser support. :)
[2015-09-17 12:38:05] Ardesco: My favourite JavaScript talk: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
[2015-09-17 12:38:11] dude-x: "i want to write UI tests" "now you have one problem" "i want to write them in javascript" "now you have 3 problems"
[2015-09-17 12:38:31] jleyba: dude-x, if i were to write webdriver tests, I would do it in js
[2015-09-17 12:38:49] jleyba: but I still maintain the #1 rule to being successful with webdriver is to not use webdriver
[2015-09-17 12:38:53] dude-x: jleyba: why's that? can you write the tests synchronously?
[2015-09-17 12:39:08] jleyba: dude-x, I don't mind async programming
[2015-09-17 12:40:00] AutomatedTester: jleyba: puppeteer(i think that's its name) instead?
[2015-09-17 12:40:02] dude-x: only reason i do mind is because i haven't learned async programming like javascript or asyncio/twisted on python
[2015-09-17 12:40:09] barancev: lukeis: can we exclude tests from the python package and fix #994?
[2015-09-17 12:40:11] lukeis: callback chains look so ugly to meâ€¦
[2015-09-17 12:40:20] lukeis: barancev: we do already
[2015-09-17 12:40:28] lukeis: i have no idea how that happened
[2015-09-17 12:41:04] lukeis: unless AutomatedTester did that release without using `go py_release` (which auto-strips the test packages from setup.py)
[2015-09-17 12:41:27] dude-x: tests are not normally packaged...
[2015-09-17 12:41:33] *dude-x checks'
[2015-09-17 12:41:34] AutomatedTester: I did the last one 2.47.3 without crazyfun

[2015-09-17 12:42:08] AutomatedTester: I think*

[2015-09-17 12:55:43] AutomatedTester: The new iPhone can do 4k video iirc
[2015-09-17 12:55:56] AutomatedTester: so not having 4k on Apple tv sounds like a silly idea
[2015-09-17 12:56:08] jleyba: compare the price points of the phone to the tv
[2015-09-17 12:56:28] AutomatedTester: so people don't stream their phones to their tv?
[2015-09-17 12:56:30] dude-x: AutomatedTester: i don't have a 4k TV
[2015-09-17 12:56:37] dude-x: it's okay with me.
[2015-09-17 12:56:43] dude-x: plus the standard is in flux.
[2015-09-17 12:57:06] dude-x: most 4K TVs out don't support HDR (High dynamic range)
[2015-09-17 12:57:16] dude-x: and even the cabling standard is in flux
[2015-09-17 12:57:43] dude-x: the latest spec includes HDR and high bit rate;
[2015-09-17 12:57:58] dude-x: and only now there's UHD-BluRay

[2015-09-17 13:00:43] dude-x: then there's the content info; while UDH TVs can scale to 4K nicely, 4K content is better to watch. There's only a smattering at the moment; even if the iPhone can record 4K video
[2015-09-17 13:01:02] dude-x: i'd bet it would compare to the time that the iPhone had 1080p video, it was a bit jelly like
[2015-09-17 13:01:35] dude-x: when Firefox Servo is released it should get a nine-tailed fox as it's logo

[2015-09-17 13:19:13] jleyba: That's the file loaded when the SafariDriver opens a new browser, which triggers a new session in the extension

[2015-09-17 13:21:18] qwebirc14159: can any of you help me please?
[2015-09-17 13:21:19] barancev: jleyba: let me repeat: SafariDriver establishes the connection to the browser (with the extension installed) and loads this client.js to the browser over this connection. right?
[2015-09-17 13:21:39] qwebirc14159: I've windows 8.1
[2015-09-17 13:22:19] jleyba: barancev, Communication is reversed (b/c you can't run a httpd in a Safari extension *cough*firefox security*cough*)
[2015-09-17 13:22:44] jleyba: So the extension uses WebSockets to communicate with the WebDriver client
[2015-09-17 13:23:06] jleyba: The WebDriver client launches the Safari browser (which is assumed to have the extension installed)
[2015-09-17 13:23:31] jleyba: The browser is pointed at a HTML page with client.js
[2015-09-17 13:23:43] barancev: jleyba: ok, but what I wonder is why it is not included in the extension? why is it loaded from the client?
[2015-09-17 13:23:44] qwebirc14159: does any1 know what's causing this?
[2015-09-17 13:23:53] rorycb, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-09-17 13:23:55] jleyba: client.js uses JS magic to poke the extension, tell it where to connect to
[2015-09-17 13:24:41] jleyba: barancev, no way for the extension to know when a new browser session is being created
[2015-09-17 13:24:56] jleyba: it only sees new window events
[2015-09-17 13:26:12] qwebirc14159: can anyone help me, please?
[2015-09-17 13:26:40] barancev: jleyba: ok, got it
[2015-09-17 13:27:48] qwebirc14159: is there an admin here?
