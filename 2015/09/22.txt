[2015-09-22 06:55:13] Halobit: RedAero,  JS
[2015-09-22 06:55:28] RedAero: Er...
[2015-09-22 06:55:34] RedAero: Wat?
[2015-09-22 06:55:45] Halobit: RedAero, Like writing some JS code that do that.
[2015-09-22 06:55:58] Halobit: RedAero, What do you want to include in page header?
[2015-09-22 06:56:03] RedAero: The page I'm trying to use with Selenium (and python) is broken, and I have no access to the source
[2015-09-22 06:56:10] RedAero: I would like to fix it

[2015-09-22 06:58:28] Timg: I have an issue where I cannot find_element_by_name using the IE webdriver. NoSuchElementException occurs for all elements in the page. Elements can be found by tag name and ID. I can use the Firefox web driver to find the same elements by name on the same page without issue.
[2015-09-22 06:58:35] gusTester: you can inject js to a page via selenium using driver.execute_script('js-script-here') right?
[2015-09-22 06:58:50] Timg: Is this a known bug with the IE driver? I couldn't find anything
[2015-09-22 06:58:54] RedAero: well, yeah, but will that work to fix a shitty function?

[2015-09-22 07:01:25] RedAero: but we'll see
[2015-09-22 07:01:35] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: a method is a function

[2015-09-22 07:10:52] stongo: any idea how to mitigate that?
[2015-09-22 07:11:23] Timg: Yeah use implicit waits

[2015-09-22 07:20:30] Timg: So the iedriver crashes when doing a find_elements_by_tag_name.
[2015-09-22 07:20:32] sgsabbage: stongo: hmm, that's a tough one. Maybe catch the timeout exception and try again?
[2015-09-22 07:20:39] Timg: This is great
[2015-09-22 07:21:43] stongo: sgsabbage: that's a good idea. I'm really looking for any strategy to improve test reliability because we're using it for monitoring
[2015-09-22 07:22:19] stongo: there's a threshold for 2 tests failing to trigger a page, but we get 1 false alarm a day

[2015-09-22 07:46:19] RedAero: I mean, it's a function that JS tries to call but can't find. If I define it, shouldn't it work?

[2015-09-22 10:33:40] jimevans: dyce: cookies are not disabled in the anonymous profile the firefox driver creates by default. you can use an existing profile as a template (that will get copied) for the profile the driver will use. i honestly can't remember if using the template profile brings cookies along with it.
[2015-09-22 10:34:39] CSWookie: Hey, all.  I'm using Python webdriver bindings.  Is there a way to do el.find_element_by_xpath() to do an xpath that is across the whole document, but refers to el in a predicate?
[2015-09-22 10:36:05] jimevans: CSWookie: take webdriver out of it. how would you do that in an xpath statement?
[2015-09-22 10:36:12] anu_c, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-22 10:36:47] CSWookie: Like this: el.find_element_by_xpath('//div[starts-with(@id, concat(substring-before(<el is used here>/descendant::span[starts-with(normalize-space(.), "General")]/@id, "_span"), "Menu"))]')
[2015-09-22 10:37:05] jimevans: nope. you're missing my point
[2015-09-22 10:37:26] jimevans: how would you do it with document.evaluate() [in raw javascript in your browser's development console]?
[2015-09-22 10:38:12] jimevans: (though "./descendant::span…" might work. i've no idea.
[2015-09-22 10:38:15] jimevans: )
[2015-09-22 10:38:23] CSWookie: jimevans: In an xpath statement I'd probably have a way to access the element from the root at the the place where I have <el is used here>.
[2015-09-22 10:39:18] jimevans: CSWookie: the point being that finding an element via xpath isn't doing anything magical to the xpath. just like finding by css selector isn't doing anything magical.
[2015-09-22 10:39:43] jimevans: you should be able to plug your xpath statment directly into document.evaluate() and get the same node
[2015-09-22 10:40:04] jimevans: just like you should be able to plug your css selector into document.querySelector() and get the same node.
[2015-09-22 10:41:03] jimevans: if i understand xpath directly (and i freely admit i may not), using "." should be the equivalent of <el is used here>.

[2015-09-22 10:41:48] CSWookie: I don't think it is, because inside a predicate, it treats "." as the node that is being predicated.
[2015-09-22 10:42:09] CSWookie: Which is not what I want, in this case.
[2015-09-22 10:42:30] jimevans: okay, maybe so. but my initial statement still stands. figure out how you'd do it in raw xpath.
[2015-09-22 10:42:41] jimevans: that'd be the same when using findElement
[2015-09-22 10:43:07] CSWookie: OK.  I was hoping there was magic I could use.  Thanks.

[2015-09-22 12:47:15] jimevans: sohlemac: no one on the current core dev team for selenium believes enough in the record-playback paradigm to actively maintain IDE.
[2015-09-22 12:47:40] jimevans: there's nothing preventing someone from picking it up and enhancing it, but no one is passionate about that part of the project

[2015-09-22 12:53:59] garyst1981: only thing I found nice about record-playback thing is that when you are starting, when you are totally new at coding/automation testing. It helps you a lot, you can record-playback, then export the code, see what's there, reuse/reapply in your real tests, look at it as a reference, just that

[2015-09-22 12:54:54] jimevans: because it was designed to use the selenium RC api, instead of the selenium webdriver api.

[2015-09-22 14:12:35] jimevans: not yet. i just got 10547 installed yesterday.
[2015-09-22 14:13:01] titusfor_: I'm making the same call I did in the last build; it is opening the browser, but it is returning:
[2015-09-22 14:13:08] jimevans: given that the driver hasn't been updated to my knowledge, i wouldn't expect any change in behavior
[2015-09-22 14:13:21] titusfor_: {"sessionId":null,"status":6,"value":{"message":null}}
[2015-09-22 14:14:26] titusfor_: that's both with Ruby bindings running spec and running driver manually and hitting it with a rest client (which works in previous build)
[2015-09-22 14:14:50] jimevans: that's a generic failure to create a session.
[2015-09-22 14:15:09] titusfor_: right. It opens browser, but returns that. Would it have this issue if the browser takes too long to open?
[2015-09-22 14:15:27] jimevans: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-09-22 14:15:47] titusfor_: :-D
[2015-09-22 14:16:05] titusfor_: anyway, please let me know if it works for you when you get around to testing it
