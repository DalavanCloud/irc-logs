[2015-09-23 02:08:56] merlinp, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-23 02:09:00] tango0o: yes, I think so..
[2015-09-23 02:09:05] WhereIsMySpoon: Venus_Mars: a form will only be submitted with an input type="submit" or by calling submit() on the form element
[2015-09-23 02:09:30] tango0o: BUT.
[2015-09-23 02:09:38] tango0o: you need to supply you script code in this arguments place.
[2015-09-23 02:11:20] Venus_Mars: So, when I on the page , I opened console of chrome and entered myFunc()
[2015-09-23 02:11:27] Venus_Mars: The form got submitted
[2015-09-23 02:11:35] tango0o: I think you could exec...script("btn_dom.click();")
[2015-09-23 02:11:43] WhereIsMySpoon: then why are you asking us if it works if u know it works
[2015-09-23 02:11:46] WhereIsMySpoon: :S :S :S
[2015-09-23 02:11:52] Venus_Mars: But when I do the samething on selenium, myFunc() gets called.. but the form is no getting submitted.
[2015-09-23 02:12:03] WhereIsMySpoon: Venus_Mars: :gist us the function
[2015-09-23 02:12:10] WhereIsMySpoon: paste into that website and give us the url
[2015-09-23 02:12:14] Venus_Mars: *but the form is not getting submitted.
[2015-09-23 02:12:33] tango0o: the function maybe NOT exist this context.
[2015-09-23 02:13:13] Venus_Mars: I can see the console.logs statements added when i called myFunc() on selenium's execute_script
[2015-09-23 02:13:43] Venus_Mars: so it is very much available in the context.
[2015-09-23 02:13:43] WhereIsMySpoon: Venus_Mars: why are u calling the function with execute script?
[2015-09-23 02:13:47] WhereIsMySpoon: why are u not just clicking the butto
[2015-09-23 02:13:48] WhereIsMySpoon: n
[2015-09-23 02:14:10] Venus_Mars: Ok.. the website javascript doesn't work in chrome
[2015-09-23 02:14:14] tango0o: right!! I also think so .
[2015-09-23 02:14:49] Venus_Mars: So we copied their code and made some syntactic changes
[2015-09-23 02:14:58] Venus_Mars: and changed the function identifier
[2015-09-23 02:15:01] WhereIsMySpoon: Venus_Mars: this isnt answering my q
[2015-09-23 02:15:02] tango0o: Could you supply you code, which call exec..script (....)
[2015-09-23 02:15:03] Venus_Mars: and called the function
[2015-09-23 02:15:14] WhereIsMySpoon: why are u not clicking the btn with selenium
[2015-09-23 02:16:11] Venus_Mars: click the button is not working in chrome.. because the js has syntactic issues. Eg, myFuncOriginal() --> copied it to myFunc() with correct syntax
[2015-09-23 02:16:23] Venus_Mars: and i call myFunc()
[2015-09-23 02:16:32] WhereIsMySpoon: oic
[2015-09-23 02:16:37] tango0o: try to do:  the string as javascript: myFunc();
[2015-09-23 02:16:52] WhereIsMySpoon: Venus_Mars: so u can see when u call myFunc that it is actually running
[2015-09-23 02:16:57] WhereIsMySpoon: but just that the form isnt submitted
[2015-09-23 02:16:58] Venus_Mars: yes.
[2015-09-23 02:17:03] Venus_Mars: exactly
[2015-09-23 02:17:05] WhereIsMySpoon: right
[2015-09-23 02:17:35] WhereIsMySpoon: Venus_Mars: you could just grab the form element in execute script after u call myFunc and call submit() on it
[2015-09-23 02:17:39] Venus_Mars: when i add document.getElementsByName('myFormName')[0].submit()
[2015-09-23 02:17:45] Venus_Mars: the result is different :(
[2015-09-23 02:17:48] WhereIsMySpoon: oh
[2015-09-23 02:17:50] WhereIsMySpoon: =/
[2015-09-23 02:17:50] tango0o: er, yes. If the page exist js error, the function still NOT be executed
[2015-09-23 02:18:13] WhereIsMySpoon: Venus_Mars: to be honest you should be poking the dev
[2015-09-23 02:18:18] WhereIsMySpoon: and telling him to update the js

[2015-09-23 07:23:58] WhereIsMySpoon: croepha: ha
[2015-09-23 07:24:01] croepha: WhereIsMySpoon: Ill try to figure out the difference
[2015-09-23 07:24:04] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2015-09-23 07:24:33] WhereIsMySpoon: croepha: perhaps look specifically at the selectors and more complex html in your real life example and/or timing issues
[2015-09-23 07:24:55] croepha: yea
[2015-09-23 07:25:07] croepha: im thinking it might be timing, because im doing some angualr
[2015-09-23 07:25:17] croepha: angular

[2015-09-23 07:40:10] qwebirc74518: hi - if I have a element that selenium thinks is not displayed but jQuery (and me, with my eyes) thinks is visible, how can I debug what is happening?
[2015-09-23 07:40:29] WhereIsMySpoon: qwebirc74518: make sure that there isnt an element in front of it
[2015-09-23 07:40:46] WhereIsMySpoon: qwebirc74518: also what are you doing that selenium thinks it isnt visible? youre trying to click it? select it?
[2015-09-23 07:41:29] qwebirc74518: WhereIsMySpoon: I'm using an expected condition to wait for it to be visible
[2015-09-23 07:41:55] WhereIsMySpoon: qwebirc74518: you may need to use a specialised one
[2015-09-23 07:42:06] qwebirc74518: and now I'm also manually checking is_displayed() and it's false
[2015-09-23 07:42:17] WhereIsMySpoon: one sec
[2015-09-23 07:42:52] WhereIsMySpoon: qwebirc74518: you may need to instead check myElement.getCssValue("visibility").equals("hidden")
[2015-09-23 07:43:16] qwebirc74518: ok - I'll give that I try
[2015-09-23 07:43:24] WhereIsMySpoon: thats a jquery/angular visibility
[2015-09-23 07:43:29] WhereIsMySpoon: and is different to the normal visibility stuff
[2015-09-23 07:43:29] qwebirc74518: will selenium still complain if I try to click on it?
[2015-09-23 07:43:40] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-23 07:44:07] qwebirc74518: WhereIsMySpoon: ahh, so selenium and jquery do use different visibilities?
[2015-09-23 07:45:15] WhereIsMySpoon: qwebirc74518: css visibility is different from display: none
[2015-09-23 07:45:59] qwebirc74518: WhereIsMySpoon: does selenium just check for display: none?
[2015-09-23 07:46:03] WhereIsMySpoon: qwebirc74518: im not sure
[2015-09-23 07:46:07] dude-x, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)

[2015-09-23 07:47:08] qwebirc74518: yeah
[2015-09-23 07:47:10] WhereIsMySpoon: bootstrap and angular ive not had too much issue with

[2015-09-23 08:46:11] WhereIsMySpoon: what the hell is up with IE's performance
[2015-09-23 08:46:23] WhereIsMySpoon: the same simple css selector in IE takes like half a second
[2015-09-23 08:46:31] WhereIsMySpoon: in chrome its instant
[2015-09-23 08:46:38] WhereIsMySpoon: IE11 even
[2015-09-23 08:48:14] barancev: IE follows the principle "think before you do"
[2015-09-23 08:48:28] WhereIsMySpoon: this is utterly stupid
[2015-09-23 08:48:44] WhereIsMySpoon: I have a simple js method that does a css selector on a very few input elements and checks/unchecks them
[2015-09-23 08:48:51] barancev: my mom said it is a good plinciple
[2015-09-23 08:48:52] WhereIsMySpoon: in IE, if you check/uncheck the master checkbox
[2015-09-23 08:48:57] WhereIsMySpoon: you have to do it slowly
[2015-09-23 08:49:02] WhereIsMySpoon: else u need to click it twice
[2015-09-23 08:49:07] WhereIsMySpoon: in chrome u can click it as fast as you want
[2015-09-23 08:49:14] WhereIsMySpoon: all because of this stupid selector
[2015-09-23 08:49:25] WhereIsMySpoon: i even took off the forEach loop that went off the selector and the performance is the same
[2015-09-23 08:49:37] WhereIsMySpoon: ridiculous
[2015-09-23 08:49:54] WhereIsMySpoon: $$('#my_id input:not([disabled])')
[2015-09-23 08:49:57] WhereIsMySpoon: thats my selector
[2015-09-23 08:50:05] WhereIsMySpoon: it's grabbing...drum roll...four <input> elements
[2015-09-23 08:50:57] dude-x: i think the not adds a bit of complexity for IE
[2015-09-23 08:51:02] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: you able to shed light on this?

[2015-09-23 08:52:06] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2015-09-23 08:52:14] RedAero: is selenium smart enough to wait for stuff like page loads, or will it throw an error immediately if it can't find something?
[2015-09-23 08:52:26] RedAero: Or does it wait a set amount of time every time (implcit wait)
[2015-09-23 08:52:29] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: what is "page load"
[2015-09-23 08:52:38] RedAero: er...
[2015-09-23 08:52:39] dude-x: WhereIsMySpoon: i remember when i used to test against ie8 that sometimes the DOM was slightly diffreent from Chrome/Firefox.
[2015-09-23 08:52:41] WhereIsMySpoon: (tip: there is no right answer)
[2015-09-23 08:52:49] dude-x: did you inspect the page to see it's the same structure
[2015-09-23 08:53:00] sircapsalot1: :waits

[2015-09-23 08:53:17] RedAero: I click a submit button, then immediately afterwards start looking for an element. Will selenium wait until the page loads, or wait a set amount of time?
[2015-09-23 08:53:21] RedAero: I know 'bout waits...
[2015-09-23 08:53:32] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: what does "until the page loads" mean
[2015-09-23 08:53:35] korg, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-23 08:53:43] WhereIsMySpoon: do you want to wait for the onload event?
[2015-09-23 08:53:48] WhereIsMySpoon: do you want to wait for all ajax events to complete?
[2015-09-23 08:53:57] WhereIsMySpoon: (that isnt even possible sometimes)
[2015-09-23 08:53:58] RedAero: fuck if I know
[2015-09-23 08:54:01] WhereIsMySpoon: well then
[2015-09-23 08:54:05] WhereIsMySpoon: there's your answer :p
[2015-09-23 08:54:09] titusfor_: RedAero: Selenium waits for document ready state, but there is a lot of dynamic javascript on most pages now, so that check often isn't sufficient
[2015-09-23 08:54:14] sircapsalot: 0.0
[2015-09-23 08:54:14] RedAero: I just want to know whether an abnormally long load time will screw my code up
[2015-09-23 08:54:29] RedAero: titusfor_: That was more like an answer I was hoping for
[2015-09-23 08:54:31] WhereIsMySpoon: what titusfor_ said
[2015-09-23 08:54:39] titusfor_: yeah race conditions are the bane of test automation right now
[2015-09-23 08:54:41] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: I was more trying to educate you on the concept of load and waits
[2015-09-23 08:55:09] RedAero: WhereIsMySpoon: I get it, but I got no further... I can't actually tell what the page is doing while loading, or rather, I'm not going to bother
[2015-09-23 08:55:14] RedAero: I just want my code to work
[2015-09-23 08:55:19] WhereIsMySpoon: okay
[2015-09-23 08:55:28] WhereIsMySpoon: then if you arent sure, wait for an element to be visible
[2015-09-23 08:55:29] titusfor_: What language are you using?
[2015-09-23 08:55:31] WhereIsMySpoon: or clickable

[2015-09-23 08:56:27] RedAero: well, that's basically the nature of my question: will I need to add explicit waits to every event following an expected page refresh/load
[2015-09-23 08:56:32] RedAero: titusfor_: python
[2015-09-23 08:56:46] RedAero: because I'd rather not
[2015-09-23 08:57:01] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: you need to add waits to stuff that may take a variable or non zero amount of time to appear
[2015-09-23 08:57:10] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: that's just how web automation works
[2015-09-23 08:57:16] WhereIsMySpoon: you do it yourself when browsing
[2015-09-23 08:57:21] WhereIsMySpoon: you wait for that button to be there
[2015-09-23 08:57:28] RedAero: I was hoping selenium was smart enough to have that built in
[2015-09-23 08:57:28] WhereIsMySpoon: or that text field to appear so you can search
[2015-09-23 08:57:34] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: did you listen earlier?
[2015-09-23 08:57:39] WhereIsMySpoon: it isn't possible
[2015-09-23 08:57:41] RedAero: and by built in I mean enabled by default
[2015-09-23 08:57:52] RedAero: well, it's possible to wait a set amount of time, which it does
[2015-09-23 08:57:53] titusfor_: yeah, but what does "smart enough" mean?
[2015-09-23 08:58:06] titusfor_: you tell selenium to click something
[2015-09-23 08:58:07] RedAero: "smart enough" to not get tripped up the majority of the time, I guess
[2015-09-23 08:58:12] titusfor_: it blows up if it isn't there
[2015-09-23 08:58:23] titusfor_: that is "correct" behavior for browser automation software
[2015-09-23 08:58:24] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium webdriver is an api
[2015-09-23 08:58:26] WhereIsMySpoon: not a framework
[2015-09-23 08:58:31] WhereIsMySpoon: or a product
[2015-09-23 08:58:33] titusfor_: you told it to do something it can't so it raises an exception
[2015-09-23 08:58:47] WhereIsMySpoon: you build your test automation framework and suites
[2015-09-23 08:58:49] WhereIsMySpoon: using the api
[2015-09-23 08:58:59] WhereIsMySpoon: this is intentional
[2015-09-23 08:59:09] RedAero: titusfor_: Yeah, but when I tell it to do something, what I'm actually telling it is to keep trying whatever I told it for a given amount of time
[2015-09-23 08:59:15] RedAero: Implicit wait, in other words
[2015-09-23 08:59:18] RedAero: which is good enough
[2015-09-23 08:59:25] titusfor_: I get it, I've written that implementation for Watir
[2015-09-23 08:59:51] titusfor_: but it belongs in a test library (like Watir for Ruby), not in a browser automation library (Selenium)
[2015-09-23 08:59:55] WhereIsMySpoon: ^^^^^^^^
[2015-09-23 09:00:02] titusfor_: I see it as a separation of concerns issue
[2015-09-23 09:00:12] WhereIsMySpoon: this 100%
[2015-09-23 09:00:31] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium gives you -all- the tools you need to make test suites
[2015-09-23 09:00:41] WhereIsMySpoon: you can then decide to make wrapper functions
[2015-09-23 09:00:46] WhereIsMySpoon: (I have a whole class full of them)
[2015-09-23 09:00:53] titusfor_: I'm not sure what is out there for python. I know that both Capybara and Watir try to solve this issue in Ruby
[2015-09-23 09:01:03] WhereIsMySpoon: like waitClickableThenClick(WebElement, timeToWait)
[2015-09-23 09:01:16] WhereIsMySpoon: and so on..
[2015-09-23 09:01:33] titusfor_: yeah, in watir it ends up being element.when_present.click
[2015-09-23 09:01:40] RedAero: WhereIsMySpoon: Does that function include an implicit wait or a sleep?
[2015-09-23 09:01:45] titusfor_: and I want it to actually be element.click
[2015-09-23 09:01:47] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: it includes an explicit wait
[2015-09-23 09:01:57] RedAero: right
[2015-09-23 09:02:00] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: you can't "include" implicit waits
[2015-09-23 09:02:03] WhereIsMySpoon: you either turn them on or off
[2015-09-23 09:02:12] RedAero: titusfor_: Selenium can do that, I was just asking about default behavior
[2015-09-23 09:02:13] WhereIsMySpoon: and if you have explicits they should be off
[2015-09-23 09:02:13] titusfor_: yeah, implicit waits are bad
[2015-09-23 09:02:20] WhereIsMySpoon: and yea theyre bad anyway
[2015-09-23 09:02:27] swampdragons, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-09-23 09:02:37] RedAero: why are they bad if they work?
[2015-09-23 09:02:57] RedAero: I mean, is an implicit wait I write myself also bad?
[2015-09-23 09:02:57] titusfor_: they aren't enough by themselves, and require other workarounds
[2015-09-23 09:03:03] WhereIsMySpoon: there are several articles about this
[2015-09-23 09:03:14] RedAero: i.e. "try to click this element and if you get an error wait 1000 ms, then try again, for a total of 5 tries"
[2015-09-23 09:03:22] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: an explicit wait is not a self written implicit wait
[2015-09-23 09:03:26] titusfor_: that's an explicit wait
[2015-09-23 09:03:35] RedAero: is it?
[2015-09-23 09:03:50] RedAero: That is my understanding of how an implicit wait essentially works...
[2015-09-23 09:03:54] titusfor_: sorry, brain half functioning still
[2015-09-23 09:04:11] titusfor_: element.click automatically waiting a pre-set amount of time requires an implicit wait
[2015-09-23 09:04:18] RedAero: "An implicit wait is to tell WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find an element or elements if they are not immediately available. "
[2015-09-23 09:04:38] RedAero: That'd basically solve most of my expected issues
[2015-09-23 09:04:41] titusfor_: or you can write your framework in a way that captures the exception and retires
[2015-09-23 09:04:46] titusfor_: for clicks
[2015-09-23 09:04:48] WhereIsMySpoon: the issue is that if you ever want a specific type of wait you have to turn implicits off
[2015-09-23 09:04:54] WhereIsMySpoon: cause they cannot both be on
[2015-09-23 09:05:01] titusfor_: or polling for the lack of existence of an element
[2015-09-23 09:05:06] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-23 09:05:14] RedAero: WhereIsMySpoon: is that a fault of implementation, or an unavoidable conflict?
[2015-09-23 09:05:16] WhereIsMySpoon: and impicit wait is internal to teh system so if it changes you have no visibility of whats going on
[2015-09-23 09:05:35] RedAero: titusfor_: Well yeah, but that's more hassle than it's worth to me for this thing
[2015-09-23 09:05:39] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: you've told it to turn on implicit wait, so when you do an explicit wait, you'll have collision
[2015-09-23 09:05:44] lukeis: teh system!
[2015-09-23 09:05:57] RedAero: WhereIsMySpoon: Couldn't the latter supersede the former?
[2015-09-23 09:06:11] titusfor_: it is all context dependent. If you need one thing done in one way and it won't change or grow or need maintaining, implicit wait could be just fine
[2015-09-23 09:06:12] RedAero: i.e. ignore implicit when explicit is called?
[2015-09-23 09:06:15] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: you can answer that
[2015-09-23 09:06:24] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwZwkk7q25I&t=42
[2015-09-23 09:06:46] RedAero: titusfor_: That's basically the idea here, this isn't super serious stuff I'm doing, just a thingie to automate my job :D
[2015-09-23 09:06:54] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont know what that is but i dont have headphones in my pc
[2015-09-23 09:06:56] WhereIsMySpoon: and i dont wanna switch them
[2015-09-23 09:06:59] titusfor_: go for it, see if it works :)
[2015-09-23 09:07:14] WhereIsMySpoon: tias (try it and see) is my programming motto
[2015-09-23 09:07:17] titusfor_: it's not best practice for a test suite, but if you are automating things as a convenience
[2015-09-23 09:07:21] RedAero: titusfor_: You are diggin you ow grave, if it doesn't, I'll be right back here! :D
[2015-09-23 09:07:27] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: no, you are
[2015-09-23 09:07:32] WhereIsMySpoon: we just told you they suck
[2015-09-23 09:07:34] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-09-23 09:07:45] RedAero: porque no los dos?
[2015-09-23 09:08:10] WhereIsMySpoon: because you're the one asking
[2015-09-23 09:08:30] titusfor_: lol, no grave, I'm here spouting my opinions regardless :)
[2015-09-23 09:09:04] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: I think this is a debate about implicit / explicit waits… but I don't care enough to really get involved :)
[2015-09-23 09:09:33] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: basically this from RedAero: "WhereIsMySpoon: Couldn't the latter supersede the former? "
[2015-09-23 09:09:37] titusfor_: implicit / explicit beer drinking?
[2015-09-23 09:09:49] WhereIsMySpoon: titusfor_: what does implicit beer drinking mean i wonder
[2015-09-23 09:09:58] lukeis: like my waits, i only prefer explicit beer drinking ;)

[2015-09-23 09:16:09] WhereIsMySpoon: pot vendor is that way ---->
[2015-09-23 09:16:12] RedAero: is there a default implicit wait in selenium?
[2015-09-23 09:16:16] WhereIsMySpoon: no
[2015-09-23 09:16:20] WhereIsMySpoon: not unless u turn it on
[2015-09-23 09:16:25] lukeis: RedAero: yes, it's 0 :-D
[2015-09-23 09:16:34] WhereIsMySpoon: gah

[2015-09-23 09:16:38] titusfortner: :)
[2015-09-23 09:16:39] RedAero: so the code will execute once and only once when it's reached, and if it fails, it fails
[2015-09-23 09:16:44] WhereIsMySpoon: yep
[2015-09-23 09:16:47] RedAero: I see

[2015-09-23 09:18:03] RedAero: The reason I'm asking is that it seems really unlikely that the code is running as fast as it can with the browser keeping up

[2015-09-23 09:18:35] RedAero: hmm
[2015-09-23 09:19:27] RedAero: there must be some sort of waiting in there... code runs at a million miles a second, Chrome doesn't, and yet it's keeping up with all my form entering and refreshing...
[2015-09-23 09:19:54] RedAero: which is very helpful, just unexplained
[2015-09-23 09:20:05] lukeis: the driver commands block until the 'action' they are taking completes

[2015-09-23 09:20:32] WhereIsMySpoon: ^ this isnt the same as waiting for the next command
[2015-09-23 09:20:50] WhereIsMySpoon: e.g. if a click works straight away but it refreshes part of the page you then try to get an element from it will crash out
[2015-09-23 09:21:05] WhereIsMySpoon: but if a click does something that is process intensive it will wait until the click is done
[2015-09-23 09:21:10] WhereIsMySpoon: i think ive got that right
[2015-09-23 09:21:53] lukeis: although the click isn't guaranteed to wait even if the click 'does' something, so don't count on it! :)
[2015-09-23 09:22:18] lukeis: command following any click should be an explicit wait :)
[2015-09-23 09:22:32] WhereIsMySpoon: pretty much usually

[2015-09-23 09:22:46] WhereIsMySpoon: unless the click does something that is purely client based and is very simply
[2015-09-23 09:22:49] WhereIsMySpoon: simple*
[2015-09-23 09:22:57] WhereIsMySpoon: even then
[2015-09-23 09:23:14] WhereIsMySpoon: browser -> driver -> selenium com is slower than code running
[2015-09-23 09:23:26] WhereIsMySpoon: so yea..dont be surprised if you have wait issues
[2015-09-23 09:23:27] D3M0S: RedAero, jumping in mid convo probably
[2015-09-23 09:23:34] D3M0S: RedAero, are you using Page Factory?
[2015-09-23 09:24:48] lukeis: who uses that crap? ;)
[2015-09-23 09:24:57] RedAero: WhereIsMySpoon: See, that's the thing: clicks and dropdown selects are seemingly triggering very helpful waits
[2015-09-23 09:25:16] WhereIsMySpoon: i HATE ie8
[2015-09-23 09:25:22] RedAero: my code is basically a bunch of text entry, then a dropdown, then text entry, then dropdown
[2015-09-23 09:25:24] WhereIsMySpoon: hate hate hate hate hate hate
[2015-09-23 09:25:29] lukeis: ie8 hates you too
[2015-09-23 09:25:35] WhereIsMySpoon: i know
[2015-09-23 09:25:43] RedAero: and it works flawlessly (so far) with no waitys
[2015-09-23 09:25:45] WhereIsMySpoon: stupid pile of overused garbage
[2015-09-23 09:25:52] D3M0S: What you're possibly seeing is the Locator stuff running, it's creating your page objects for you, defining locators etc...this is all Object Proxied, meaning your elements are lazily initialized, only when you actually use the element does it activate the locator and initialize the element for you
[2015-09-23 09:26:42] WhereIsMySpoon: ^ only if you're using pageobjects/page factory though
[2015-09-23 09:26:48] D3M0S: ^yes
[2015-09-23 09:26:57] RedAero: I don't think I am though
[2015-09-23 09:27:01] WhereIsMySpoon: and even then, it still is quite fragile
[2015-09-23 09:27:33] D3M0S: RedAero, which language are you using? and did you build your framework or using one someone else wrote?
[2015-09-23 09:27:49] RedAero: python
[2015-09-23 09:28:11] RedAero: and uh, I wrote everything from the ground up
[2015-09-23 09:28:21] D3M0S: then you'd know if you were using PageFactory
[2015-09-23 09:28:27] RedAero: the selenium bit is basically just a .ge
[2015-09-23 09:28:28] RedAero: er
[2015-09-23 09:28:42] RedAero: .get() and some clicks and dropdowns
[2015-09-23 09:28:45] RedAero: super simple stuff
[2015-09-23 09:28:57] RedAero: (to be replaced by direct JS code execution, but that's later)
[2015-09-23 09:29:16] RedAero: so anyway, I don't know why or how it works, but I'm happy it does
[2015-09-23 09:29:22] D3M0S: RedAero, do you specify implicit waiting on your WebDriver object?
[2015-09-23 09:29:23] WhereIsMySpoon: great
[2015-09-23 09:29:26] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2015-09-23 09:29:27] RedAero: Nope
[2015-09-23 09:29:37] WhereIsMySpoon: you're just lucky then
[2015-09-23 09:29:42] RedAero: I did initially until Spoon told me not to :(

[2015-09-23 09:30:12] WhereIsMySpoon: i know

[2015-09-23 09:31:12] D3M0S: jimevans, you only missed the normal bitching about IE8
[2015-09-23 09:31:19] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: oh hi :) I was asking you earlier about some terrible IE 11 performance on a css selector
[2015-09-23 09:31:27] WhereIsMySpoon: and wondered if you could shed light
[2015-09-23 09:31:44] WhereIsMySpoon: $$('#my_id input:not([disabled])') takes about 0.5s to complete
[2015-09-23 09:31:49] jimevans: but if a click involves a navigation, RedAero, there's a "best effort" to wait until <some set of conditions>, but it's not guaranteed at all
[2015-09-23 09:31:51] WhereIsMySpoon: in chrome its instant
[2015-09-23 09:32:06] D3M0S: joshbruning, do you know what you've gotten me into?
[2015-09-23 09:32:15] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-09-23 09:32:21] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: yay lol
[2015-09-23 09:32:28] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: it just seems really damn weird thats all
[2015-09-23 09:32:36] WhereIsMySpoon: even in ie 11
[2015-09-23 09:32:46] WhereIsMySpoon: that the perforamnce is so crappy
[2015-09-23 09:33:01] WhereIsMySpoon: means that my master checkbox cant be clicked on and off very fast at all else it needs 2 clicsk
[2015-09-23 09:33:05] jimevans: i'd imagine that the :not pseudoselector probably hasn't had the full set of testing over multiple versions that other selectors have
[2015-09-23 09:33:23] RedAero: jimevans: By that you mean selenium tries to wait?
[2015-09-23 09:33:37] WhereIsMySpoon: "if a click involves a navigation,"
[2015-09-23 09:33:46] RedAero: yeah,
[2015-09-23 09:33:47] RedAero: so yes
[2015-09-23 09:33:49] RedAero: cool

[2015-09-23 09:33:56] jimevans: RedAero: "best effort." but it's implementation-dependent (chrome vs. firefox vs. IE) may do it differently
[2015-09-23 09:34:06] jimevans: and it's not guaranteed by any stretch.
[2015-09-23 09:34:10] RedAero: That's also good to know
[2015-09-23 09:34:38] RedAero: It's all good, eventually every setting will be replaced with JS so there won't be any page refreshes anymore
[2015-09-23 09:34:42] jimevans: also, implicit waits *only* wait on the presence of an element, not its interactability
[2015-09-23 09:34:46] RedAero: or at least very few, which I can catch with ECs
[2015-09-23 09:35:13] RedAero: Hmm, that *may* be a problem, I'll have to check once something breaks
[2015-09-23 09:35:20] jimevans: so you could use implicit waits to find and element, but it still not be ready to be clicked on because it's hidden, or disabled, or something else.

[2015-09-23 09:36:14] jimevans: as a matter of personal preference, i avoid implicit waits almost always, preferring to use so-called (and somewhat misnamed) explicit waits.
[2015-09-23 09:36:50] jimevans: as a further matter of personal preference, i wish we'd never introduced implicit waits into the API, because it only serves to cause confusion
[2015-09-23 09:37:03] jimevans: also, mixing implicit and explicit waits is undefined behavior.
[2015-09-23 09:37:35] D3M0S: jimevans, :) I've deprecated Implicit Waits in my framework, soon to be opensourced
[2015-09-23 09:37:40] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: I agree on 1st and 2nd counts tbh, there is so much confusion about implicits
[2015-09-23 09:37:43] AutomatedTester: jimevans: it doesnt give undefined behaviour
[2015-09-23 09:37:45] WhereIsMySpoon: and waits in general
[2015-09-23 09:37:55] AutomatedTester: it give unexpected behaviour
[2015-09-23 09:38:05] WhereIsMySpoon: surely if its unexpected you cant define it
[2015-09-23 09:38:07] D3M0S: in favor of Implicitly Explicit waits, lol
[2015-09-23 09:38:16] AutomatedTester: "why did my 'explicit wait' only loop once?
[2015-09-23 09:38:18] WhereIsMySpoon: as it isnt deterministic
[2015-09-23 09:38:21] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i mean "undefined" in the sense that the C/C++ language specs mean "undefined"
[2015-09-23 09:38:35] lukeis: until you need to make sure an element is not present… then implicit waits suck ;)

[2015-09-23 09:39:20] RedAero: jimevans: Well, once can always code a simple for loop to replace an implicit wait
[2015-09-23 09:39:23] jimevans: because there's no way to tell how the interaction between the two wait types will go. you might be able to figure it out, but it's implementation-specific, so it might change.
[2015-09-23 09:39:26] RedAero: even though it might be a bad idea
[2015-09-23 09:39:43] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: that's what an explicit wait is..
[2015-09-23 09:39:47] jimevans: RedAero: but then, that's an explicit wait. :O)
[2015-09-23 09:40:14] RedAero: "An implicit wait is to tell WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find an element or elements if they are not immediately available."

[2015-09-23 09:41:58] jimevans: titusfortner: i confirmed last night that 10547 requires an update to the microsoft webdriver implementation. which they haven't released yet. apparently, they had it all lined up to ship, but the one guy (yes, apparently it's "one guy") who could officially sign the executable for distribution was out of the office from friday to yesterday.

[2015-09-23 09:42:59] RedAero: Oh, I understand that they shouldn't be mixed, but it appears I'm not understanding what an implicit wait really is, if "a for loop for 5 seconds or until the code runs through with no exceptions" is an explicit wait, at least based on the definition in the documentation
[2015-09-23 09:43:01] titusfortner: well, at least that's not additional evidence for...

[2015-09-23 10:00:10] jimevans: and the open-source community (and members thereof) who bitterly complain about backward compatibility are implying they have no idea how enterprise software works, and the realities of the business world.

[2015-09-23 10:00:35] D3M0S: sohlemac, the reason thrings written in Java 3 still work on Java 8 is that adherance to backwards compatiblity.  There are some technologies that are favored because they provide long term support to your product.

[2015-09-23 10:02:11] D3M0S: jimevans, was C# written with Generics or was it an enhancmeent?

[2015-09-23 10:03:29] D3M0S: jimevans, good point, large enterprise applications making use of it
[2015-09-23 10:03:39] sohlemac: jimevans: That sounds like an argument to have an enterprise version of IE that makes the tradeoff for compatibility and a consumer version that "does things right"

[2015-09-23 10:04:23] sohlemac: WhereIsMySpoon: Point taken.
[2015-09-23 10:04:24] D3M0S: jimevans, I'm just interested in how Java employed Type Erasure and C# did not, and what prompted each language to make it's decision
[2015-09-23 10:04:43] jimevans: the .NET framework and C# have been receiving major support and pushes from MSFT since their introduction in 2001
[2015-09-23 10:05:05] jimevans: but i believe java generics came first
[2015-09-23 10:05:25] D3M0S: Java Generics was 1.5 (2004)
[2015-09-23 10:06:57] jimevans: and anders basically did the design to "do it right"
[2015-09-23 10:07:10] D3M0S: It's kind of a big decision to not use Type Erasure, but the convenice is worth it, so for a language to essentially break its' backwards compatibility, it would have to judge the size of its' userbase and determine if the risk is worth it.
[2015-09-23 10:07:39] D3M0S: or yeah, have the "do it right" conviction, bar all concequences

[2015-09-23 10:09:10] D3M0S: anyways, Type Erasure is a pretty major drag on modern Java, and Java seems to be bigger than ever, so I'm wondering if it will ever go away.  Makes me super jelly of C# sometimes.

[2015-09-23 10:14:11] jleyba: Or does the spec only support switching by WebElement now?
[2015-09-23 10:14:23] jimevans: element and index

[2015-09-23 11:14:39] qwebirc49476: the server is there and running, when i 127.0.0.1:4444/selenium-server/driver/?cmd=getLogMessages it shows stuff
[2015-09-23 11:14:55] qwebirc49476: it 404s from the browser. i guess 500 from script
[2015-09-23 11:15:36] jimevans: but i suspect that the http server is written to not respond to the base url without a query string.
[2015-09-23 11:15:40] jimevans: though i don't know for sure
[2015-09-23 11:15:48] jimevans: the code is on github, though.

[2015-09-23 11:16:46] jimevans: there might be someone else who's had experience working with the RC portion of the selenium server, but they're not here in the channel right now.
[2015-09-23 11:16:54] jimevans: honestly, most of them have moved on from the projec.t
[2015-09-23 11:17:11] jimevans: after all, RC has been deprecated for something like 4+ years now.
[2015-09-23 11:17:15] qwebirc49476: i dont blame them. the new version looks much better. I would too if i could install the dependencies
