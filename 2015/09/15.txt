Currently running Selenium grid 2.47.1 on windows server 2003 (XP) with IE 8 and when executing tests, browser is opening, URL is opened but getting NoSuchElementException element not found.

[2015-09-15 07:38:10] D3M0S: kinda pseudo code, because i didn't fill in the findbys
[2015-09-15 07:38:16] D3M0S: but you get the point
[2015-09-15 07:38:29] D3M0S: equivilant now is this @FindBy @FindBy @FindBy
[2015-09-15 07:38:54] dude-x: got it
[2015-09-15 07:39:46] D3M0S: when you repeat, if the @FindBy annotation is marked as @Repeatable, the compiler will assume it's the same thing as the old way

[2015-09-15 07:48:22] D3M0S: sircapsalot, oh, well it gets confusing sometimes, especially when you don't have a face with the name.
[2015-09-15 07:49:09] D3M0S: OctavianProxyIss, I'd assume you can connect to it the same way you could any other VM
[2015-09-15 07:49:25] sircapsalot: as simonstewart had said.. we should've had our github, and IRC nick on our badges ;)
[2015-09-15 07:49:28] D3M0S: once the image is docked and running, it's just a VirtualBox VM I think
[2015-09-15 07:49:44] D3M0S: sircapsalot, true that
[2015-09-15 07:49:52] OctavianProxyIss: thanks, I did a search and there is a docker attach command that should do the trick
[2015-09-15 07:50:05] D3M0S: OctavianProxyIss, awesome
[2015-09-15 07:50:44] sircapsalot: also yes, WhereIsMySpoon.. i typically avoid that sort of vibe from songs.. I like positive and uplifting.
[2015-09-15 07:50:52] D3M0S: OctavianProxyIss, you could possibly ssh into the box and ping the hosts

[2015-09-15 08:07:47] D3M0S: OctavianProxyIss, I think the problem is in your hosts file
[2015-09-15 08:07:58] D3M0S: OctavianProxyIss, which OS are you docking?

[2015-09-15 08:08:41] OctavianProxyIss: D3M0S: yes, I've set the domain I am looking for to 127.0.0.1, but it seems that does not point to the host system
[2015-09-15 08:09:23] D3M0S: OctavianProxyIss, so this might have to do with the type of bridging you're doing for the LAN on your VM
[2015-09-15 08:09:28] OctavianProxyIss: D3M0S: the host system is CentOs 7
[2015-09-15 08:09:37] OctavianProxyIss: the docker image is the one from SeleniumHQ
[2015-09-15 08:10:07] OctavianProxyIss: well, I can access external domains, like google.com
[2015-09-15 08:10:23] D3M0S: OctavianProxyIss, like I said, I'm not very familiar with docker.  I have some experience with VMs
[2015-09-15 08:10:29] OctavianProxyIss: so... I believe that the issue is between the host and docker image

[2015-09-15 08:10:52] D3M0S: OctavianProxyIss, let me make sure I'm understanding your problem as best I can
[2015-09-15 08:11:17] D3M0S: so you have a docker image, and this docker image is hosting your websites, or the machine the image is on is hosting the sites?
[2015-09-15 08:11:37] OctavianProxyIss: the machine the image is on is hosting the sites
[2015-09-15 08:11:50] D3M0S: ah ok, in that case, I don't think you would use localhost
[2015-09-15 08:11:50] OctavianProxyIss: the docker image is only hosting selenium

[2015-09-15 08:12:27] drptbl, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2015-09-15 08:12:41] D3M0S: or modifiy the docker hosts file to point the url selenium is testing to the host machine IP address
[2015-09-15 08:13:48] D3M0S: so localhost, in very simple terms, means "this machine" in the case of a docker image, it means the docker image only, not the machine hosting the image
[2015-09-15 08:14:13] D3M0S: does that make sense?
[2015-09-15 08:14:57] D3M0S: so on your local machine, run ipconfig, or ifconfig depending on OS
[2015-09-15 08:15:17] D3M0S: the machine running the docker image, not in the docker image

[2015-09-15 08:51:25] rufat: Hello Selenium users! I'm automating web application using Selenium
[2015-09-15 08:51:50] rufat: my frtamework written in Ruby and using Cucumber features as well as RSpec
[2015-09-15 08:52:00] qwebirc48563: anybody please help..<table id=table1 border="1"bgcolor=FFFF00> using IDE how can i verify color..
[2015-09-15 08:52:21] qwebirc48563: i am trying but not getting it done corectly..i am newbie
[2015-09-15 08:53:20] lukeis: qwebirc appears to be a popular irc clientâ€¦ wish they did better anonymous names  (is thinking akin to how docker names the running instances ;) )

[2015-09-15 08:54:11] sircapsalot: gotta know where they're coming from ;)
[2015-09-15 08:54:27] sircapsalot: like the automatic "Sent from my iPhone" sig
[2015-09-15 08:54:29] lukeis: could still prefix their nameâ€¦ :)
[2015-09-15 08:54:38] Venus_Mars: Is it possible to call a javascript function defined in the sources from selenium?
[2015-09-15 08:54:55] qwebirc48563: ??

[2015-09-15 08:55:25] lukeis: Venus_Mars: which 'sources' ? on the page? then yes.
[2015-09-15 08:55:32] Venus_Mars: On the page.
[2015-09-15 08:55:34] Venus_Mars: How?
[2015-09-15 08:55:40] lukeis: driver.execute_script ?
[2015-09-15 08:55:52] qwebirc48563, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2015-09-15 08:55:56] lukeis: (that's python or ruby)
[2015-09-15 08:55:57] Venus_Mars: it says, only raw javascript
[2015-09-15 08:56:43] lukeis: imagine a page that defines  function x() { alert('hi'); }   you can call it:   driver.execute_script("x();")  (although this particular example will hang)
[2015-09-15 08:58:43] Venus_Mars: can we define a function in driver.execute_script and then call that function at the end?
[2015-09-15 08:59:18] lukeis: sure

[2015-09-15 08:59:37] Venus_Mars: something like driver.execute_script(" function X(arg1) { doSomething;}; X('c')"); ?

[2015-09-15 09:00:15] lukeis: i'd rather make it anonymous thoughâ€¦. driver.execute_script("(function(arg1){ doSomething})('c')")
[2015-09-15 09:00:55] lukeis: (avoids overriding something else on the page and doesn't leave a footprint)
[2015-09-15 09:01:01] qwebirc82060: What are the latest browser versions supported on Selenium for MAC - Safari, Firefox, Chrome
[2015-09-15 09:02:32] lukeis: qwebirc82060: Firefox and Chrome are basically the latestâ€¦ are you looking for particular old versions  (I forget what safari is supported, but i believe 8? ~ although you have to manually install the extension)
[2015-09-15 09:02:50] andrewmkrug_: safari is 8
[2015-09-15 09:03:01] qwebirc82060: Ok thanks

[2015-09-15 10:47:44] andrewmkrug_: yeah preferably there would have been one laptop with everything setup for everyones talk and just leave it up there for the next person
[2015-09-15 10:49:05] andrewmkrug_: but preferably also includes internet that doesnt die on day 1
[2015-09-15 10:49:08] jleyba: lukeis, is there a command to update hte docs?
[2015-09-15 10:49:10] andrewmkrug_: just saying
[2015-09-15 10:51:42] andrewmkrug_: preferably there would be beer fountains for everyone one and the fun of the conference never ends
[2015-09-15 10:51:57] D3M0S: I could get behind this idea
[2015-09-15 10:52:52] andrewmkrug_: i am glad you can get behind this
[2015-09-15 10:53:52] D3M0S: omg this table locator has completly died during the generifying refactor....shit

[2015-09-15 10:54:47] andrewmkrug_: everyone did great during their lightning talks

[2015-09-15 10:55:43] andrewmkrug_: thanks, i think

[2015-09-15 10:56:43] ealter: i was having trouble configuring freenode
[2015-09-15 10:56:46] ealter: didn't realize it worked
[2015-09-15 10:56:53] ealter: going great D3M0S
[2015-09-15 10:57:32] D3M0S: andrewmkrug_, well I'm planning on releasing this as part of a full fledged framework, and possibly adding language bindings in the future
[2015-09-15 10:57:43] D3M0S: so you don't need to rewrite what I did, and find comparable technologies.
[2015-09-15 10:57:59] andrewmkrug_: sweet
[2015-09-15 10:58:11] D3M0S: it will run on java in the background but you can utilize everything in your own language
[2015-09-15 10:58:14] andrewmkrug_: that is still assuming i can carve the time out to mess with it
[2015-09-15 10:58:42] D3M0S: yeah, time is hard sometimes
[2015-09-15 10:58:49] ealter: D3M0S are you talking about releasing that page objects framework?
[2015-09-15 10:59:03] D3M0S: ealter, yep, working on it now
[2015-09-15 10:59:06] ealter: nice
[2015-09-15 10:59:12] ealter: it looked pretty cool
[2015-09-15 10:59:19] D3M0S: I just added @Explicitwait annotations to wrap
[2015-09-15 10:59:24] ealter: ooh. fun
[2015-09-15 10:59:45] D3M0S: also, I think implicit waiting is deprecated in my framework now :)
[2015-09-15 11:00:45] D3M0S: so you can do @FindBy and @ExplicitWait, normally you can't explicitly wait on @FindBy without a large chunk of code to accomplish it, per element.
[2015-09-15 11:01:07] errant_rider: implicit waiting IMO is an anti-pattern
[2015-09-15 11:01:37] D3M0S: I agree, also the server side aspect is a real kick in the jimmy
