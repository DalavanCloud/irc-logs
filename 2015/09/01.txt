[2015-09-01 12:11:54] simonste_: I'm here.
[2015-09-01 12:11:55] simonste_: 'sup?
[2015-09-01 12:12:02] sircapsalot: this person on irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#300Â still has not noted he has signed the CLA. Â in an instance like this - is it ok to manually implement the fix if it's something this simple, and push it myself, instead of merging?
[2015-09-01 12:12:14] sircapsalot: haha.. not irc freenode. sorry. #300
[2015-09-01 12:13:14] simonste_: Is that diff correct?
[2015-09-01 12:13:25] simonste_, changing nick to simonstewart.
[2015-09-01 12:13:40] simonstewart: It looks fine
[2015-09-01 12:13:49] simonstewart: And it's a trivial change with no other way of doing it
[2015-09-01 12:14:02] sircapsalot: right, and instead of pinging this, and waiting for a response..
[2015-09-01 12:14:07] sircapsalot: is it ok to do it myself?
[2015-09-01 12:14:16] simonstewart: As in "write the code yourself"?
[2015-09-01 12:14:22] simonstewart: Or "take this patch and apply it"?
[2015-09-01 12:14:43] sircapsalot: taking the diff and applying it
[2015-09-01 12:15:06] simonstewart: Ask him for his email address. It's possible that the CLA has already been signed
[2015-09-01 12:16:24] sircapsalot: i've pinged.  it was last active December of last year
[2015-09-01 12:16:35] simonstewart: Hmmm...
[2015-09-01 12:17:07] sircapsalot: it's such a small change i can literally open the file itself and make the change real quick
[2015-09-01 12:17:25] simonstewart: I think it'll be okay
[2015-09-01 12:17:28] sircapsalot: but i'm not sure of the legality behind that :)
[2015-09-01 12:17:37] simonstewart: But we can never accept a patch from the person again until the CLA is signed
[2015-09-01 12:17:40] sircapsalot: since, i'm not literally taking the diff and merging it and putting my name on it..
[2015-09-01 12:17:45] simonstewart: Lemme see if I can find the apache guidelines
[2015-09-01 12:17:45] sircapsalot: i'm just making the change myslf
[2015-09-01 12:19:06] simonstewart: http://docs.chef.io/community_contributions.html#the-obvious-fix-rule probably applies and is widely used
[2015-09-01 12:20:03] sircapsalot: namely then: "If you submit an obvious fix without first signing a contributor license agreement, then you are agreeing that your submission is not independently copyrightable"
[2015-09-01 12:20:46] sircapsalot: and this seems trivial enough
[2015-09-01 12:21:00] simonstewart: Indeed
[2015-09-01 12:21:18] sircapsalot: awesome.  thanks for the help simon :)

[2015-09-01 12:53:40] Alchemy: if its not there don't keep looking

[2015-09-01 12:54:30] Alchemy: Status will noly be present if something is wrong though
[2015-09-01 12:54:52] Alchemy: so because there are upto 300 games listed

[2015-09-01 12:55:24] jimevans: Alchemy: right. so either catch the NoSuchElementException, or use FindElements() (note the 's'), and check for the Count of the resulting ReadOnlyCollection being 0.

[2015-09-01 12:55:53] Alchemy: jimevans, Yeah im already try/catching its jsut it stalls the program when out of 300 games 290 of them probably do not have that line
[2015-09-01 12:56:50] sircapsalot, leaving. (#selenium)
[2015-09-01 12:57:01] Alchemy: webdriverwait will do it
[2015-09-01 12:57:12] Alchemy: seems a shame to have to set it once then set it again for one function though
[2015-09-01 12:57:17] jimevans: i still think you're waiting longer than you need to.
[2015-09-01 12:57:17] Alchemy: be handy if I could set it in the search its self
[2015-09-01 12:57:27] harbhub: jimevans, do you know of any plans of the nodejs webdriver having some implementation for wait(until.elementVisible
[2015-09-01 12:57:27] Alchemy: jimevans, yeah I do not want it to wait at all
[2015-09-01 12:57:27] harbhub: ?
[2015-09-01 12:57:34] Alchemy: if its got down to there, the page is loaded
[2015-09-01 12:57:39] Alchemy: so it should be 0, its either there or its not
[2015-09-01 12:57:55] jimevans: harbhub: i don't have anything to do with javascript bindings, including nodejs.
[2015-09-01 12:58:00] harbhub: ah okay
[2015-09-01 12:58:03] Citizenken: is there a way to see if the grid is using multiple instances/sessions? i'm looking at my machine and seeing multiple firefox processes, but only 2, when i've specified 5 instances and 5 sessions
[2015-09-01 12:58:05] harbhub: know who i should ask?
[2015-09-01 12:58:26] harbhub: perhaps the github repo is the place for me to post my request
[2015-09-01 12:58:27] harbhub: (:
[2015-09-01 12:58:43] jimevans: Alchemy: so first things first. don't use implicit waits (driver.Manage().Timeouts.ImplicitWait)
[2015-09-01 12:58:51] Alchemy: ok
[2015-09-01 12:59:02] jimevans: if you mix those with WebDriverWait, you'll get an unexpected result.
[2015-09-01 12:59:35] jimevans: and i strongly suspect that you're using implicit waits somewhere along the line.
[2015-09-01 12:59:46] Alchemy: jimevans, no its whatever it is as default

[2015-09-01 13:00:41] Alchemy: which probably does nothing at all withphantomjs
[2015-09-01 13:01:19] jimevans: if it were me, and the "status-text" class were unique, i'd just do a FindElements() for all of those elements on the page, then work backwards to get the games they're connected to.

[2015-09-01 13:03:00] jimevans: i honestly don't think webdriverwait is what you're after here.
[2015-09-01 13:03:18] Alchemy: but all thats making it really damn slow is that last try block with status-text
[2015-09-01 13:03:53] Alchemy: it drops the extraction of information from 30-40 games a second to like 1 every 1-2 seconds
[2015-09-01 13:04:01] Alchemy: it appears selenium is checking that the text does not appear
[2015-09-01 13:05:15] jimevans: well, it's searching for the element, that's for sure.

[2015-09-01 13:43:21] Alchemy: jimevans, ok I got it working how I need
[2015-09-01 13:43:26] Alchemy: is there anyway to get even more speed
[2015-09-01 13:43:42] Alchemy: would using what they called ... the xml type trees
[2015-09-01 13:43:48] Alchemy: for searching be quicker?
[2015-09-01 13:46:35] Alchemy: or any of you guys for that matter :)

[2015-09-01 13:49:07] jimevans: in my experience, using css selectors tends to be pretty robust, in that the browser vendors like to tune their selector engines for performance.
[2015-09-01 13:49:54] Alchemy: jimevans, Yeah that was my experiance as well... the other selector I cant remember the name of
[2015-09-01 13:49:58] Alchemy: xref or something?
[2015-09-01 13:50:00] jimevans: you'll always be at the mercy of the driver manufacturers' implementations
[2015-09-01 13:50:01] jimevans: xpath
[2015-09-01 13:50:03] Alchemy: was not natively supported in many browsers
[2015-09-01 13:50:12] Alchemy: so was being emulated over javascript and other things like that
[2015-09-01 13:50:17] jimevans: not supported in one, in particular.
[2015-09-01 13:50:27] Alchemy: making it actively slower in all browsers except ... was it firefox that supproted it and chrome that did not
[2015-09-01 13:50:29] Alchemy: its been a while
[2015-09-01 13:50:30] jimevans: natively, that is.
[2015-09-01 13:50:55] jimevans: nope. both firefox and chrome implement a native xpath-over-html-dom query capability
[2015-09-01 13:51:01] Alchemy: got to be IE then
[2015-09-01 13:51:06] jimevans: indeed it is
[2015-09-01 13:51:10] Alchemy: what about phantom?
[2015-09-01 13:51:20] jimevans: phantomjs uses whatever webkit provides
[2015-09-01 13:51:23] Alchemy: its what I found to be the best performing on non windows hosts
[2015-09-01 13:51:26] jimevans: i don't use phantomjs
[2015-09-01 13:51:27] Alchemy: ah cool
[2015-09-01 13:51:28] lukeis: might shave off some milliseconds by using .GetAttribute("innerText") instead of .Text ? (since the .Text call does some visibility checks)
[2015-09-01 13:51:28] jimevans: full stop
[2015-09-01 13:51:43] Alchemy: jimevans, it is so much quicker than firefox
[2015-09-01 13:51:57] jimevans: depends on your use case.
[2015-09-01 13:52:03] Alchemy: lukeis, excellent ill make the mods
[2015-09-01 13:52:28] Alchemy: jimevans, extracting information from a gambling site like odds and such
[2015-09-01 13:52:31] Alchemy: heavy js interaction
[2015-09-01 13:53:06] lukeis: and now back to what i was doingâ€¦ ;)
[2015-09-01 13:53:08] jimevans: but if i were doing something that didn't require cross-browser capability, and i insisted on using phantomjs, i wouldn't use webdriver at all.
[2015-09-01 13:53:28] Alchemy: o'rly what would you go for
[2015-09-01 13:53:45] jimevans: if i were using phantomjs, i'd just do it straight in javascript
[2015-09-01 13:53:49] smccarthy, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-01 13:54:01] Alchemy: might give that a go, might give me a little more speed removing webdriver from the mix
[2015-09-01 13:54:22] jimevans: phantomjs allows one to get at the DOM of the page being loaded, and once you have the document object, you're golden.
[2015-09-01 13:55:09] Alchemy: cool I will give it a look, be the first time using javascript like that directly
[2015-09-01 13:55:11] jimevans: you can use standard DOM manipulation to process the elements, without the need for webdriver, especially if you're not doing a ton of interaction (clicks and the like)
[2015-09-01 13:55:29] Alchemy: I do need some interactions like clicking later on
[2015-09-01 13:55:42] Alchemy: but for the monitoring I do not, suppose I could write the monitor in pure js
[2015-09-01 13:55:49] Alchemy: and when I need interaction I can use webdriver specifically for that
[2015-09-01 13:55:59] jimevans: then it might not be the best fit. might still be, i don't know the site in question, but still
[2015-09-01 13:56:11] jimevans: ideally, i'd not want to use a browser at all.
[2015-09-01 13:56:14] jimevans: api ftw!
[2015-09-01 13:56:25] jimevans: but sometimes that's unavoidable
[2015-09-01 13:56:30] Alchemy: its all by-the-by in honesty its all a bit of fun, so I do not mind taking a little detour to laern something new
[2015-09-01 13:56:32] Alchemy: knowledge is power and all :)
[2015-09-01 13:56:56] Alchemy: :google phantomjs tutorial
[2015-09-01 13:57:17] Alchemy: holy hell this looks easy

[2015-09-01 14:27:09] benkai, leaving. (#selenium)
[2015-09-01 14:27:36] Porfa: i want something to match that for instance
[2015-09-01 14:28:53] lukeis: tourdedave: you don't want people to actually 'print' a ticket via eventbright, do you?
[2015-09-01 14:29:23] dude-x: Porfa: i think there's partial link text
[2015-09-01 14:29:25] tourdedave: Ideally no.

[2015-09-01 14:50:05] Porfa: or.. better would be if i can tell selenium to use utf-8
[2015-09-01 14:50:30] Porfa: by default.. because i can't hit the link i want because some tilde characters and stuff
[2015-09-01 14:51:55] dude-x: Porfa: all text that comes back as unicode utf-8 from selenium
[2015-09-01 14:52:06] dude-x: well at least as unicode in other languages

[2015-09-01 16:07:29] Alchemy: Hey guys really the wrong channel for this one, but all about browser automation and the project channel is dead... would one of you be willing to bail me out with a basic phantomjs script (no errors) I could just do with knowing why its not doing anything (no console.log)
[2015-09-01 16:07:35] Alchemy: if so: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=2Q9Q59mX
[2015-09-01 16:09:10] D3M0S: tourdedave, did you see that paste?
[2015-09-01 16:10:11] D3M0S: I'm wondering if it would be better to just have the return object and bust the Action up into an annotation
[2015-09-01 16:10:36] D3M0S: oh...not possible
[2015-09-01 16:10:39] D3M0S: nvm
[2015-09-01 16:16:48] tourdedave: D3M0S: Nice. Don't know who
[2015-09-01 16:17:37] D3M0S: yeah, it can make page objects super dry if you're willing to dig into creating custom decorators, locators, etc...
[2015-09-01 16:19:03] D3M0S: tourdedave, I've done another where I can parse out text from elements and return them as the wanted type
