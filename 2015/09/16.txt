[2015-09-16 08:51:01] WhereIsMySpoon: windows has some really shitty characters
[2015-09-16 08:51:03] WhereIsMySpoon: like this one: -
[2015-09-16 08:51:09] WhereIsMySpoon: this isnt a regular dash, its a windows dash
[2015-09-16 08:51:16] lukeis: is it - or — ? ;)
[2015-09-16 08:51:20] WhereIsMySpoon: and in git it shows as the diamond question mark

[2015-09-16 09:02:11] simonstewart: I'm unpicking other people's assumptions
[2015-09-16 09:02:28] simonstewart: On the plus side, the .Net support we hacked at SeConf has now finished code review and is in Buck's tree
[2015-09-16 09:02:38] lukeis: oooh, shiny
[2015-09-16 09:03:02] simonstewart: I need to find some teams in Facebook that want to use it too :)
[2015-09-16 09:03:02] lukeis: what's left in the selenium tree to tackle then?
[2015-09-16 09:03:18] simonstewart: Ruby is the biggie
[2015-09-16 09:03:27] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: Windows Phone team?

[2015-09-16 09:04:50] simonstewart: All I know is that we don't have support for lots of MS stuff, so I find it unlikely they're using Buck to build it

[2015-09-16 09:05:39] simonstewart: Ha! :)
[2015-09-16 09:05:47] simonstewart: I should have added "yet" :)
[2015-09-16 09:05:52] simonstewart: Buck really is rather spiffy
[2015-09-16 09:06:07] [rahul]: :)
[2015-09-16 09:06:18] AutomatedTester: I really should find time to play with buck properly
[2015-09-16 09:06:31] simonstewart: We have some basic rust support
[2015-09-16 09:06:42] titusfortner: I haven't looked at the Buck code at all. What do we need for Ruby to work?
[2015-09-16 09:07:20] simonstewart: Probably "ruby_gem" and "ruby_test"
[2015-09-16 09:07:26] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: do you know if Buck delegates to cargo or does rustc itself?
[2015-09-16 09:07:31] simonstewart: I'm guessing that Ruby is mostly a packaging thing

[2015-09-16 09:08:05] simonstewart: titusfortner: is there a way to wrap everything a ruby library depends on into a single deployable unit?
[2015-09-16 09:08:09] simonstewart: Like an über jar
[2015-09-16 09:08:14] simonstewart: Or a PEX
[2015-09-16 09:08:15] simonstewart: ?
[2015-09-16 09:08:27] WhereIsMySpoon: ruby has gems
[2015-09-16 09:08:33] simonstewart: Are they zips?
[2015-09-16 09:08:38] WhereIsMySpoon: er
[2015-09-16 09:08:48] WhereIsMySpoon: theyre the equivalent of jars
[2015-09-16 09:08:50] titusfortner: dependency management
[2015-09-16 09:08:52] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont know if theyre actually zips
[2015-09-16 09:08:57] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: https://github.com/facebook/buck/blob/master/src/com/facebook/buck/rust/RustCompileStep.java and https://github.com/facebook/buck/blob/master/src/com/facebook/buck/rust/RustBuckConfig.java#L38
[2015-09-16 09:09:11] simonstewart: Yeah, I knew that they were equivalent of jars
[2015-09-16 09:09:26] titusfortner: Everything I've done has gone and grabbed what it has needed
[2015-09-16 09:09:28] simonstewart: I guess "ruby_gem" would actually just be "ruby_library"
[2015-09-16 09:09:48] AutomatedTester: rustc
[2015-09-16 09:09:56] AutomatedTester: hmmm
[2015-09-16 09:10:07] AutomatedTester: might be a plane thing
[2015-09-16 09:10:17] simonstewart: titusfortner: if we add "ruby_binary", I'd probably have to write the equivalent of PEX
[2015-09-16 09:10:29] simonstewart: https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex
[2015-09-16 09:10:29] titusfortner: I don't know why we'd need that?
[2015-09-16 09:11:03] simonstewart: It makes deploying things Really Easy
[2015-09-16 09:11:19] simonstewart: Just scp the archive to the server and execute it
[2015-09-16 09:11:40] simonstewart: But it's not necessary for us to replace the existing CrazyFun ruby support
[2015-09-16 09:12:09] D3M0S: good morning/afternoon everybody
[2015-09-16 09:12:11] titusfortner: Right, but if you are using ruby you're always going to be requiring the gem, so you just need a gem, and likely you aren't going to have a local gem repository, so you are just going to need that gem on rubygems.org
[2015-09-16 09:12:29] simonstewart: Not if you've checked your deps into third-party :)

[2015-09-16 09:36:04] WhereIsMySpoon: it basically allows you to do stuff like have scroll bars, keep text inside a certain bounding area etc

[2015-09-16 09:36:28] lukeis: one aspect…. basically make a div act like a frame… and then trick people like airwave87 who think the content is just a frame (cause it is) and then they use a div with an overflow inside! ha!

[2015-09-16 09:38:03] titusfortner: lukeis: I wanted to have a PR so I could tweet it out that we fixed the issue we had during the SeConf workshop
[2015-09-16 09:38:29] titusfortner: but yes, in general, Alex and I swap PRs as a way to review code before it gets committed.
[2015-09-16 09:38:31] lukeis: yes, you can have a PR… but push the code, don't click 'merge' in Github :)
[2015-09-16 09:38:47] titusfortner: then the PR shows up as not merged
[2015-09-16 09:38:55] lukeis: it can and does
[2015-09-16 09:39:08] titusfortner: then I just learned something fun and important this morning
[2015-09-16 09:39:18] jtri: it's the add_lib.click() that fails on line 117, https://dpaste.de/X53k
[2015-09-16 09:39:41] jtri: if i add the sleep statements things work fine, but i think they are a horrible fix
[2015-09-16 09:39:44] lukeis: titusfortner: it doesn't show up 'merged' when we amend the commit and 'sign off' on it… but if you were to push your original commit, it would show up that way

[2015-09-16 09:40:07] titusfortner: right, that makes sense

[2015-09-16 09:41:30] lukeis: o.0 "So basically i have implemented cusomt wait methods and then i am monkey patching the driver to be able to use these custom methods" … and they are logging a bug with selenium
[2015-09-16 09:42:13] AutomatedTester: totes makes sense
[2015-09-16 09:42:14] jtri: and its so random, sometimes it works, sometimes it fails... has to be timing related
[2015-09-16 09:42:42] AutomatedTester: jtri: use WebDriverWait?
[2015-09-16 09:42:44] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: link bug#?
[2015-09-16 09:42:50] lukeis: #1044
[2015-09-16 09:43:10] jtri: WebDriverWait: using it
[2015-09-16 09:43:41] jtri: maybe you can tell where/how I'm using it wrong?  https://dpaste.de/DU58
[2015-09-16 09:44:23] jtri: problem is with the click on line 117, but only when i run the add_jslib_to_ufile first
[2015-09-16 09:45:08] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: looks like hes just making shorthands for the wait methods and adding them onto the webdriver class
[2015-09-16 09:45:13] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont see a big problem with that?..
[2015-09-16 09:45:13] jtri: yeah, if i comment out line 85 everything works fine
[2015-09-16 09:45:54] jtri: WhereIsMyS: i was doing that, with self.wait, but went to using WebDriverWait b/c i thought it might be causig problems
[2015-09-16 09:46:03] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: sure… and then throw in an event firing webdriver in the mix and I'm sure they aren't or are overriding something they should or shouldn't be
[2015-09-16 09:46:13] WhereIsMySpoon: jtri: you're using selenium RC
[2015-09-16 09:46:21] WhereIsMySpoon: you should be using webdriver
[2015-09-16 09:46:25] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: ah...right
[2015-09-16 09:46:32] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: i'm not going to waste my time troubleshooting *their* issue
[2015-09-16 09:46:36] WhereIsMySpoon: yea

[2015-09-16 09:47:18] WhereIsMySpoon: it just looked like you were
[2015-09-16 09:47:25] WhereIsMySpoon: nvm ignore me
[2015-09-16 09:47:33] WhereIsMySpoon: jtri: also you know you can tab complete nicks?
[2015-09-16 09:47:36] WhereIsMySpoon: on irc
[2015-09-16 09:48:15] WhereIsMySpoon: so         add_lib = WebDriverWait(self.selenium, 5).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, '//*[@id="main_table"]/tbody/tr[1]'))) passes fine but then the click on it doesnt work?
[2015-09-16 09:48:16] jtri: WhereIsMySpoon: great on tab complete
[2015-09-16 09:48:23] WhereIsMySpoon: thats...weird
[2015-09-16 09:48:52] WhereIsMySpoon: oh wait...hang on
[2015-09-16 09:48:58] WhereIsMySpoon: jtri: you're trying to click on the tr?
[2015-09-16 09:49:18] jtri: also weird that commenting line 85 the whole thing works from the call on line 86, right
[2015-09-16 09:49:18] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont think tr's are a valid click() element
[2015-09-16 09:49:58] jtri: WhereIsMyS: will try to see about the click on tr issue...
[2015-09-16 09:50:13] WhereIsMySpoon: jtri: you can try using the Actions api
[2015-09-16 09:50:14] jtri: using datatables, fyi
[2015-09-16 09:50:37] WhereIsMySpoon: in java it would be new Actions(myWebDriverObject).click(myWebElement)
[2015-09-16 09:50:50] WhereIsMySpoon: this will click in the middle of the element using coordinates
[2015-09-16 09:50:56] WhereIsMySpoon: rather than trying to invoke click() on it

[2015-09-16 09:52:18] WhereIsMySpoon: yep

[2015-09-16 09:54:41] WhereIsMySpoon: click(webElement).perform() is the same as moveToElement(webElement).click().perform()
[2015-09-16 09:55:01] WhereIsMySpoon: perform() just means "do this sequence" since actions is a fluent api
[2015-09-16 09:55:20] WhereIsMySpoon: and follows a builder pattern
[2015-09-16 09:55:24] WhereIsMySpoon: so you build up a set of actions
[2015-09-16 09:55:28] WhereIsMySpoon: and then perform them

[2015-09-16 10:33:21] titusfortner: Right. The tester at the conference from slack said he could look into getting us some kind of open source account, but yeah, we'd be at their whim for continuing to use it

[2015-09-16 10:44:10] titusfortner: but if they are supposed to know what they are doing, they should figure out how to locate something that doesn't have an ID

[2015-09-16 10:52:07] errant_rider: is what terratoma is talking about
[2015-09-16 10:52:19] simonstewart: Is there a "connecting to IRC from Slack" document?
[2015-09-16 10:52:24] simonstewart: Then it all becomes moot
[2015-09-16 10:52:41] simonstewart: We keep the Open interface that plenty of people use day-to-day

[2015-09-16 10:54:42] sgsabbage: I am a Brit, I like Slack for work, but I don't think it's the right move to use for an open channel like #selenium
[2015-09-16 10:54:57] themightyabby: errant_rider: I receive a "Cannot start the driver service" - but it launches the chromedriver
[2015-09-16 10:55:29] titusfortner_: Not sure what BNC is, someone said something to me about another solution that I also couldn't get set up in a way that did what I want, but I also was operating on no sleep when I tried that one. :)
[2015-09-16 10:55:45] andrewmkrug_: is asking how many shallows it takes to carry a coconut a good interview question?
[2015-09-16 10:55:49] brma: I'm trying to track down why this change was made, but I think it must have been on the older issue tracker based on the issue number of 6358, is that issue tracker still left around somewhere?  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/commit/1b3c4fcf96d37f53130612f37021005e7eb865dc

[2015-09-16 15:15:47] AnConio: exactly! boring cases but some comments above kept mentioning using Actions
[2015-09-16 15:16:37] dude-x: probably due to mouse over stuff

[2015-09-16 15:19:00] dude-x: loa, do you mean driver.get?
[2015-09-16 15:19:05] loa: yes
[2015-09-16 15:19:08] dude-x: it will wait until document is ready
[2015-09-16 15:19:26] dude-x: otherwise you'd have to configure the driver to use a fast load strategy
[2015-09-16 15:19:38] dude-x: which means it will timeout if the get takes too long

[2015-09-16 15:39:11] simonstewart: It's not got a great API
[2015-09-16 15:39:11] D3M0S: I think he means, that he wishes he never made them, because it's limiting people imagination on the possibilites that exist
[2015-09-16 15:39:26] simonstewart: And if I had my time again, I'd rework it completely
[2015-09-16 15:39:28] simonstewart: Or just delete it.
[2015-09-16 15:39:33] simonstewart: It was trivial to write
[2015-09-16 15:40:06] simonstewart: I'm not going to do that since it's about a million years old at this point
[2015-09-16 15:40:11] simonstewart: And loads of people use it
[2015-09-16 15:40:23] AnConio: it caught my attention 'cause earlier in the conference I'd also asked another senior guy there about the PageFactory and he too said he didn't use it

[2015-09-16 15:41:06] simonstewart: The current implementation is the thing I don't like
[2015-09-16 15:41:17] D3M0S: yes, the Decorator/Locator stuff is very much "corn"
[2015-09-16 15:41:18] simonstewart: Particularly since people very seldom set their own elementlocatorfactory
[2015-09-16 15:42:40] D3M0S: Yeah, it's a sample that people depend on too much, instead of implementing their own version, most people use it as a crutch, and then they dont get some seriously awesome stuff
[2015-09-16 15:43:16] D3M0S: Anyways, hopefully some of my stuff will fix that when I open source.
[2015-09-16 15:44:31] simonstewart: Google have something nicer too

[2015-09-16 15:44:55] simonstewart: AnConio: the idea was always that people would build better tooling on top of webdriver's apis
[2015-09-16 15:45:41] nirvdrum: Did someone ping me earlier? I think my chat buffer filled.
[2015-09-16 15:46:35] simonstewart: There was some magnificent trolling going on earlier
[2015-09-16 15:46:47] AnConio: simonstewart: Got it. I confused your statements with some blog I read earlier about not using the PageFactory class as it was too limiting for other uses
[2015-09-16 15:47:12] nirvdrum: Aww. That's my favorite time waster.
[2015-09-16 15:47:15] simonstewart: NP. Glad to have helped clear things up :)
[2015-09-16 15:47:24] D3M0S: thanks simonstewart
[2015-09-16 15:47:46] AnConio: simonstewart: and since I'm using it a lot in my automation framework, I panicked. No harm done. Thanks.
[2015-09-16 15:48:00] simonstewart: :yt my favorite waste of time
[2015-09-16 15:48:12] simonstewart: nirvdrum: ^^ Not that?

[2015-09-16 15:48:43] D3M0S: AnConio, honestly, you can use it a ton, and you can even do a huge amount of stuff by still using the default PageFactory but using your own Locator and Decorator factories
[2015-09-16 15:48:44] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I pinged you
[2015-09-16 15:48:49] nirvdrum: Heh.
[2015-09-16 15:49:00] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: WhereIsMySpoon_ was saying how good rubygems.org is for getting gems
[2015-09-16 15:49:14] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: we were talking about having a third_part/ in a repo
[2015-09-16 15:49:15] simonstewart: Damnit. Now I'm listening to hits of the 80s
[2015-09-16 15:49:18] AutomatedTester: well simonstewart was
[2015-09-16 15:49:20] nirvdrum: Oh. It's rubbish.
[2015-09-16 15:49:30] simonstewart: All software is rubbish
[2015-09-16 15:49:38] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: he says it the awesums
[2015-09-16 15:49:52] simonstewart: The uttermost bestest
[2015-09-16 15:50:01] nirvdrum: But it seems whenever I explain why it's rubbish, a bunch of people that really don't know what they're talking about tell me how I'm developing software wrong.
[2015-09-16 15:50:11] simonstewart: Hey! I have that with maven
[2015-09-16 15:50:46] AnConio: D3M0S: perhaps but I've found the locator factories to be over my head and rather undocumented! Particularly for C#.  I did however like your lightning talk on Dryer POMs
[2015-09-16 15:50:54] loa: dude-x, looks like it is working, thx.
[2015-09-16 15:51:32] AutomatedTester: what do we want? Awesome software! How do we want it? Reproducible builds! How do we want it? Deps in tree! Actually... deps on the internet are cool yo!
[2015-09-16 15:51:45] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: nirvdrum ^ is that right?
[2015-09-16 15:51:58] simonstewart: Close
[2015-09-16 15:52:21] nirvdrum: RubyGems.org added this command, "gem yank", that lets people just remove published gems.  It's 100% halted deployments on me on more than one occasion.  The best part about it is it can happen at any time for any reason, so you can't even catch it with CI.  I've caught it mid deploy.  But, if you already have the yanked gem install, you won't even notice.  So, it'll happen when you're trying to bring a new server up.  Usually you're
[2015-09-16 15:52:22] nirvdrum: bringing a new server up for a particular reason -- not the time you want to be screwing with untested dependencies.
[2015-09-16 15:52:28] D3M0S: AnConio, when I open source it will shed a lot of light on them, and hopefully provide some better documentation.
[2015-09-16 15:52:31] nirvdrum: It undermines the entire system.
[2015-09-16 15:52:59] nirvdrum: So, your only real recourse is to mirror everything.  Aside from the inherent bootstrapping issues there, no one does it.  It's an undue burden.
[2015-09-16 15:53:02] simonstewart: What we need is a shared repo shared over BitTorrent
[2015-09-16 15:53:13] D3M0S: I'm torn between working on getting the code in an open sourceable state and blogging about this stuff.  Only so much time.
[2015-09-16 15:53:18] Meorge: anyone know how I can fix this? http://pastebin.com/6773A6Sj
[2015-09-16 15:53:23] D3M0S: I'll do a bunch of blogging after I get it out there though.
[2015-09-16 15:53:29] simonstewart: D3M0S: meh. Do the thing that makes you happiest
[2015-09-16 15:53:44] AnConio: D3M0S: that would be cool. but for now...I'll keep reading
[2015-09-16 15:53:51] Meorge: current code: http://pastebin.com/5Puj7TCt
[2015-09-16 15:53:53] nirvdrum: But, hey, for a while yanking a gem meant it was just removed from the search index. So, in a pinch you could at least install it directly via "gem install --version" (it's absolutely perverse that locking the version down in Bundler yielded a different result).

[2015-09-16 15:54:13] nirvdrum: But, they recently fixed that glitch by making "gem yank" simply delete the file.
[2015-09-16 15:54:52] nirvdrum: When I last brought this up on /r/ruby, I was downvoted and told I didn't know what I was doing.
[2015-09-16 15:55:02] D3M0S: AnConio, I'm kinda jelly, C# would make this stuff a lot easier, type erasure in java always gives me a headache, though ResolvableType in Spring has been a massive help
[2015-09-16 15:55:05] nirvdrum: A group of people that have never run a gem mirror telling me I should run one.
[2015-09-16 15:55:19] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: you aren't a millenian that your problem
[2015-09-16 15:55:25] AutomatedTester: millenial
[2015-09-16 15:55:41] D3M0S: I see my self as part of the "Oregon Trail" generation
[2015-09-16 15:56:03] D3M0S: http://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/04/oregon-trail-generation/
[2015-09-16 15:56:15] nirvdrum: I can count on two hands the number of people I know that have ever used a profiler.  Yet whenever optimization comes up, someone mentions you should profile first.  It's that sorta thing.
[2015-09-16 15:56:54] AutomatedTester: kids these days...
[2015-09-16 15:56:57] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I'm convinced that the "artifacts shouldn't be in the repo" crowd got it wrong.
[2015-09-16 15:57:27] nirvdrum: And since the SCM of the day can't handle binaaries well, they continue to make up mind boggling best practices to compensate.
[2015-09-16 15:57:52] AutomatedTester: npm shipped empty tar balls today

[2015-09-16 15:58:11] nirvdrum: maven is generally better.  I don't see many people delete released versions. But snapshots get deleted all the time, so you can't even build shit that built a week ago.
[2015-09-16 15:58:11] AutomatedTester: so... yea... let's use the internet for deps

[2015-09-16 15:58:49] AutomatedTester: else I will turn into a pumpkin
[2015-09-16 15:58:53] nirvdrum: So, what's the proposal? No longer bundle our dependencies?
[2015-09-16 15:58:56] D3M0S: You know what, I'm getting really tired of people using @RunWith for everything JUnit!
[2015-09-16 15:58:58] AutomatedTester: hmmmm pumpkin pie
[2015-09-16 15:59:10] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: we were talking about buck
[2015-09-16 15:59:21] AutomatedTester: and how to get ruby bindings to use buck
[2015-09-16 15:59:25] AutomatedTester: which lead to gems
[2015-09-16 15:59:35] D3M0S: "Sure, I'd love to rewrite your shit code and make it into something actually extensible for you"
[2015-09-16 15:59:45] nirvdrum: Well, we have to publish the ruby bindings to RubyGems just to be relevant.
[2015-09-16 15:59:45] AutomatedTester: which lead to "gems are the awesums"
[2015-09-16 15:59:59] nirvdrum: And that gem has dependencies that need to come from the ecosystem for anything to really work.
[2015-09-16 16:00:00] AutomatedTester: it isn't us publishing there
[2015-09-16 16:00:07] AutomatedTester: its our dependencies being in tree
