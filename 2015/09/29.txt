[2015-09-29 10:36:09] barancev: let's keep jetty for now
[2015-09-29 10:36:13] sircapsalot: are we talking S3 ?
[2015-09-29 10:36:21] barancev: yes, S3
[2015-09-29 10:36:41] barancev: I'm going to take another try
[2015-09-29 10:36:56] titusfortner: well... as long as we get the "new server" good to go, does the old server still present a roadblock to release?
[2015-09-29 10:37:24] barancev: simonstewart wants "the old server" for some reason
[2015-09-29 10:37:27] titusfortner: as in, does pulling the webdriver stuff out need to hold back a new release
[2015-09-29 10:37:43] titusfortner: but if that causes a significantly increased amount of work... :)
[2015-09-29 10:37:50] barancev: exactly
[2015-09-29 10:38:03] barancev: that's what I dislike in this idea
[2015-09-29 10:38:04] titusfortner: seems like focusing on the 10% part of the problem, when the 90% is getting RC gone
[2015-09-29 10:38:22] jimevans: let me channel simonstewart for a minute.
[2015-09-29 10:38:22] barancev: I should talk to him again
[2015-09-29 10:38:54] jimevans: just dropping RC completely, with no recourse is a really nice way to say "f-u" to enterprise users who don't update
[2015-09-29 10:40:25] barancev: recourse is "use version 2.47"
[2015-09-29 10:40:33] jleyba: +1
[2015-09-29 10:41:04] jimevans: that's an incredibly rude answer to users.
[2015-09-29 10:41:06] jleyba: Are we going to make any changes to RC code once it's split from webdriver?
[2015-09-29 10:41:27] jleyba: * that would warrant more than a bug release
[2015-09-29 10:41:36] jimevans: not that it's the wrong thing to do, but it's really, really impolite
[2015-09-29 10:41:42] jleyba: I don't follow
[2015-09-29 10:41:43] titusfortner: Am I missing the point of Selenium 3?
[2015-09-29 10:42:06] barancev: jimevans: anyway, they can't use 3.x because it is "no RC" branch
[2015-09-29 10:42:09] jleyba: How is it impolite to say 2.47.x is your same old server with RC support.  3.x is webdriver only
[2015-09-29 10:42:37] jimevans: i'm just (poorly) giving you simon's arguments.
[2015-09-29 10:42:39] sircapsalot: was 3 going to remove all S1 classes?  accoding to the release plan, we were just going to add deprecation warnings i think
[2015-09-29 10:42:52] jimevans: i'd like nothing more than to just get rid of it altogether.
[2015-09-29 10:42:55] barancev: we can create a "legacy branch", if someone is eager to fix RC issues :)
[2015-09-29 10:43:00] jimevans: major release means major changes.
[2015-09-29 10:43:03] titusfortner: +1

[2015-09-29 10:44:31] jleyba: Not too hard to get Simon to agree to changes
[2015-09-29 10:44:34] titusfortner: well, it seems like the first step is to get the WebDriver only portion ready. Then if we want to hold up a release to get an RC-only something for people to use, that's a future decision :)

The application displays a lot of real-time data, which means the DOM is refreshed frequently. As a result the tests fail regularly at more or less random places because of the StaleElementRefrenceException.
[2015-09-29 12:02:31] philipp_k: Is there any best practice do automate such "dynamic" applications?

[2015-09-29 12:04:20] titusfortner: Essentially you need a way to wrap the selenium object with the locator you are using and be able to re-look it up when you want to use it

[2015-09-29 12:06:00] philipp_k: I'm using the Java bindings at the moment so Watir isn't really an option at the moment I guess :) Regarding wrapping the selenium object you mean wrapping the WebElement?
[2015-09-29 12:06:17] titusfortner: yes
[2015-09-29 12:06:25] titusfortner: Selenide I think takes a similar approach in Java

[2015-09-29 12:11:10] philipp_k: dude-x: wrapping what exactly and always waiting for what exactly?
[2015-09-29 12:13:13] dude-x: find element calls will always do a webdriverwait for element to exist
[2015-09-29 12:13:30] eteixeira, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-29 12:14:10] titusfortner: dude-x the issue is that you can wait for an element to be there, it is there, but it has gone stale
[2015-09-29 12:14:26] philipp_k: yes, but happens is that between findElement and for example calling the getText method the element got refresehed
[2015-09-29 12:14:34] titusfortner: on dynamic websites it is easy to have elements go stale
[2015-09-29 12:14:36] philipp_k: what happens*
[2015-09-29 12:16:12] titusfortner: Watir solution: Pass all calls to elements in blocks that rescue, re-look up (assert_exists) and retry the call - https://github.com/watir/watir-webdriver/blob/master/lib/watir-webdriver/elements/element.rb#L586
[2015-09-29 12:16:32] dude-x: titusfortner: my click method and get text do a get first (and poll) and then try to interact with it. catch the exception and try again.
[2015-09-29 12:17:01] titusfortner: yeah, so same thing, catch a stale element exception and retry
[2015-09-29 12:17:03] dude-x: that's basically what i'm saying wrap all calls to use webdriver wait
[2015-09-29 12:17:16] titusfortner: those are 2 different exceptions
[2015-09-29 12:17:18] dude-x: i don't know if watir polls, or just retries once
[2015-09-29 12:17:46] titusfortner: Watir right now doesn't poll for anything unless you ask it to, but it is all tied in
[2015-09-29 12:18:09] dude-x: webdriver wait is better since it polls
[2015-09-29 12:18:12] titusfortner: Does webdriverwait poll for exist or for not stale?
[2015-09-29 12:18:23] dude-x: you can pass any function that does what you want
[2015-09-29 12:19:06] dude-x: in pytohn: WebdriverWait(driver, 30).until(lambda d: d.find_element(by, locator))
[2015-09-29 12:19:19] dude-x: you can even pass in exceptions to ignore
[2015-09-29 12:19:25] titusfortner: but you have to specify them?
[2015-09-29 12:19:37] dude-x: by default it ignores NoSuchElementException
[2015-09-29 12:19:50] titusfortner: so you have to add for stale element
[2015-09-29 12:19:59] dude-x: you can either write a function that catches and returns false, or add them to the signature of Webdriver wait
[2015-09-29 12:20:03] dude-x: yeah.
[2015-09-29 12:20:09] titusfortner: browser.element(by: locator).when_present.click
[2015-09-29 12:20:22] titusfortner: polls for exists then clicks, and retries if it is stale automatically
[2015-09-29 12:20:24] dude-x: how does when_present works?
[2015-09-29 12:20:30] dude-x: yeah same isea.
[2015-09-29 12:20:32] dude-x: idea.
[2015-09-29 12:20:33] titusfortner: polls for the element to be present
[2015-09-29 12:20:49] dude-x: interesting syntax though.
[2015-09-29 12:20:56] titusfortner: It's one of the reasons I'm so keen on Watir. The syntax is amazing
[2015-09-29 12:21:13] titusfortner: When Bret and the others wrote the API they did a good job with it.
[2015-09-29 12:21:31] dude-x: the overall theme though is to wrap webdriver to poll for you automatically and ONLY use the wrapper
[2015-09-29 12:22:46] titusfortner: yes, you need to have the element wrapped in some way or else using selenium in the real world is prohibitively difficult on dynamic sites :)
[2015-09-29 12:23:05] philipp_k: mhm. that makes sense. the question is to decide what to wrap exactly, I guess WebElement as titus suggested might be a good place
[2015-09-29 12:23:21] philipp_k: so you don't have to handle exception for getText, click, etc.
[2015-09-29 12:23:26] dude-x: philipp_k: the approach I've taken is to wrap all calls to driver
[2015-09-29 12:23:51] dude-x: WebElement is a bit trickier depending on language (depending on your comfort on extending functionality)
[2015-09-29 12:24:55] titusfortner: whereas Watir stores WebDriver::Element as an attribute in Watir::Element and adds a lot more information about the element's parents and which frame it is in, etc.
[2015-09-29 12:26:22] titusfortner: it's much chattier, but each element call verifies the browser window is there and that the parent elements are all there, and switches into the browsing context of any frames, etc
[2015-09-29 12:26:39] titusfortner: so when there is an error you get more information about what is actually missing
[2015-09-29 12:27:48] philipp_k: how are the findElement(s) methods handled for Watir::Element as they should only search in the context of that element?
[2015-09-29 12:28:02] dude-x: titusfortner: can you describe locators with descriptions? one thing i like to do in python is use tuples like (By.Id, 'some_id', 'The Red Button')
[2015-09-29 12:29:08] titusfortner: Watir's locators essentially all get translated to an xpath call, which I thought was weird/bad/wrong at first, but now I stick up for xpath usage :)
[2015-09-29 12:29:29] santiycr, quitting. (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[2015-09-29 12:29:33] dude-x: xpath?
[2015-09-29 12:29:44] dude-x: terrible for older IE automation though
[2015-09-29 12:29:51] titusfortner: don't use older IE to automate
[2015-09-29 12:29:52] titusfortner: :)
[2015-09-29 12:30:08] titusfortner: people using older IE use watir-classic which is much faster
[2015-09-29 12:30:20] titusfortner: Watir also dynamically generates the list of allowed elements via the HTML5 idl
[2015-09-29 12:30:50] titusfortner: essentially browser.i(name: 'foo', index:2) will get you the 3rd icon in the dom with the name 'foo'
[2015-09-29 12:31:07] titusfortner: or whatever
[2015-09-29 12:31:18] dude-x: i prefer writing my own CSS selectors and XPATH
[2015-09-29 12:31:34] dude-x: because i can tweak things to make tests faster
[2015-09-29 12:31:46] titusfortner: browser.div(class: 'foo').span(name: 'bar')
[2015-09-29 12:31:50] titusfortner: is how you nest

[2015-09-29 12:32:06] titusfortner: I do think test speed is overall overrated. Parallelize.
[2015-09-29 12:32:17] titusfortner: And make it easy to write and maintain
[2015-09-29 12:32:50] titusfortner: I see a lot of poor cost-benefit analysis in testing approaches
[2015-09-29 12:33:48] titusfortner: Hi AutomatedTester, I got a marionette session earlier today. Hopefully I can actually write code for it this week.
[2015-09-29 12:33:55] AutomatedTester: <3
[2015-09-29 12:34:38] titusfortner: If I'd known how much vendor talk there was going to be at the Conference, I would have felt much less guilty about submitting a Watir talk
[2015-09-29 12:34:54] sircapsalot: same here titusfortner
[2015-09-29 12:34:55] titusfortner: I was deterred by the "don't talk about your product" disclaimer
[2015-09-29 12:35:13] titusfortner: when Watir is open source, and should be much more used by people :)
[2015-09-29 12:35:54] dude-x: titusfortner: well it's not just speed that I am concerned about; but stability; if a locator takes a while to locate with a particular locator it's a sign that it will be flakey in CI tests
[2015-09-29 12:36:08] titusfortner: completely disagree
[2015-09-29 12:36:14] titusfortner: manage your race conditions
[2015-09-29 12:36:50] titusfortner: If you are reliant on how long it takes to locate something for your test to pass, you've already lost the flaky war
[2015-09-29 12:37:10] dude-x: i mean it's a sign that there's something wrong.
[2015-09-29 12:37:23] titusfortner: why?
[2015-09-29 12:38:05] dude-x: when you observe that you want to click on a button, and all the rendering on the page is done and ready, you know there's some additional synchronizing to be done.
[2015-09-29 12:38:08] titusfortner: If it takes 10 wire calls instead of 3 to do something, but it is more likely to pass, and gives better error messages when it fails
[2015-09-29 12:38:10] dude-x: that's what I'm talking about.
[2015-09-29 12:38:38] titusfortner: "done and ready" is mostly meaningless though
[2015-09-29 12:38:48] spacenomad, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-29 12:39:12] titusfortner: this is why we have to do all the wrapping because there is no reliable "and the page finishes loading" that we can rely on
[2015-09-29 12:40:14] titusfortner: maybe I'm missing your point, though. just because something takes a while to locate isn't an indication that something is wrong with the test, unless you are testing performance
[2015-09-29 12:40:30] dude-x: when you observe during a running test, that the next step is to click on a button, but it's taking 1-10 seconds to find and then click, then it's a sign that you need to account for some other condition on the page.
[2015-09-29 12:40:46] titusfortner: why?
[2015-09-29 12:40:53] titusfortner: are you testing your site's functionality or its implementation?
[2015-09-29 12:41:45] titusfortner: I have a rant against people (often highly paid consultants) who insist that testers need to figure out exactly the last thing to load on a page, or the order in which sliders appear, etc in order to properly poll for clicking an element
[2015-09-29 12:41:53] dude-x: a smooth running test will proceed quickly, even if there is ajax or some dom manipulation
[2015-09-29 12:42:10] titusfortner: the test is can you click the element, not did you figure out how to explicitly wait for all the things the web app does before you can click it
[2015-09-29 12:42:15] titusfortner: why?
[2015-09-29 12:42:27] titusfortner: a smooth running test is a meaningless concept
[2015-09-29 12:42:38] titusfortner: you care that when it passes the functionality is good, when it fails the functionality is bad
[2015-09-29 12:42:56] titusfortner: I'd argue that the time this takes, unless it is crazy long is very very unimportant relative to the above
[2015-09-29 12:43:11] nonny_t, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-29 12:44:07] dude-x: flaky tests are because you're polling the wrong thing, so if you're observing something is taking a long time, that means you have to wait on some other thing.
[2015-09-29 12:44:28] titusfortner: not if it still eventually passes and it is supposed to

[2015-09-29 12:45:18] titusfortner: we're talking different directions I think
[2015-09-29 12:45:30] titusfortner: if a test is flaky then you need to figure out what you should poll for
[2015-09-29 12:45:34] titusfortner: agreed
[2015-09-29 12:45:44] dude-x: right that was my point about changing locators
[2015-09-29 12:45:59] titusfortner: if a test takes a long time to click an element because of how things are polled, but still passes, then it isn't flaky, and doesn't need to be refactored
[2015-09-29 12:46:11] dude-x: because some locators if you use naive paths, are slow to find; which in my experience means flakiness.
[2015-09-29 12:46:53] dude-x: in practice, i do not prioritize slow but stable tests
[2015-09-29 12:46:59] dude-x: but i do fix them when I get a chnace.
[2015-09-29 12:47:45] titusfortner: we agree then :)
[2015-09-29 12:47:48] dude-x: defintion of slow, is where I see pauses for simple actions that are not server loads.
[2015-09-29 12:48:05] dude-x: not slow as in it takes 5 minutes to run.
[2015-09-29 12:48:06] titusfortner: also "slow" could mean someone hard coded a sleep
[2015-09-29 12:48:10] dude-x: but everything happens quickly.
[2015-09-29 12:48:20] titusfortner: in which case you deal sharply with them, or curse them depending. :)
[2015-09-29 12:48:26] dude-x: i do prioritize removing sleeps firsrt though.

[2015-09-29 14:30:00] juangj: seems like the intent is for the error strings to be canonical, rather than an error number
[2015-09-29 14:30:27] titusfortner: as in actually informative?

[2015-09-29 14:30:36] juangj: haha
[2015-09-29 14:30:48] juangj: well, there is still "unknown error"
[2015-09-29 14:31:04] juangj: which, i don't know about you, but i've seen a lot of that from the edge driver
[2015-09-29 14:31:08] titusfortner: yuppers
[2015-09-29 14:31:12] titusfortner: I'm filing bugs right now
[2015-09-29 14:31:41] titusfortner: though for this one, json says return nil, w3c says raise invalid argument, and edge returns unknown error
[2015-09-29 14:31:54] titusfortner: not sure how to file it :)
[2015-09-29 14:32:07] titusfortner: maybe I'll leave it alone for now
[2015-09-29 14:32:41] jimevans: remember, the edge driver doesn't speak the w3c dialect (yet)
[2015-09-29 14:32:49] titusfortner: right
[2015-09-29 14:33:06] titusfortner: but should it follow json wire protocol responses and return a nil value?
[2015-09-29 14:33:23] titusfortner: I guess it isn't a bug if there isn't an invalid argument code that isn't related to locators

[2015-09-29 15:44:29] jcunanan: hello lukeis
[2015-09-29 15:46:38] jcunanan: i think i asked this question before but need a refresher, my web app has a loading gif displayed which disables the page, what should i do to wait for this to complete before continuing with my test
[2015-09-29 15:47:13] jcunanan: the loading animation occurs after any action taking place on any pages
[2015-09-29 15:50:49] dude-x: jcunanan: are you familiar with WebdriverWait?
[2015-09-29 15:53:45] jcunanan: yes
[2015-09-29 15:53:50] jcunanan: we are currently using this
[2015-09-29 15:54:01] jcunanan: but i was wondering if there's a better solution
[2015-09-29 15:54:05] jcunanan: or what everyone else was doing
[2015-09-29 15:55:03] jcunanan: i basicallyl do waitWebDriver.until(d=>!d.findelement(Busyboxlocator).Displayed);
[2015-09-29 15:55:21] jcunanan: i guess this makes most sense
[2015-09-29 15:57:50] tony4, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-09-29 15:59:16] jcunanan: ok next question is how can i automatically call the waitwebdriver.until after every driver action?
[2015-09-29 15:59:26] jcunanan: besides setting up event handlers
[2015-09-29 16:00:02] dude-x: wrap it
[2015-09-29 16:00:54] dude-x: jcunanan: instead of calling the actual driver object for all your commands, you can create an object that will have a find element function that will always use a webdriver wait
[2015-09-29 16:00:56] dude-x: and so on
[2015-09-29 16:01:20] dude-x: and have your scripts use that wrapper instead of the raw driver object
[2015-09-29 16:03:27] jcunanan: dude-x: what about if i'm using [FindsBy] annotation in c#
[2015-09-29 16:03:42] jcunanan: i'm not actually using actual driver object to find elements
[2015-09-29 16:04:04] dude-x: jcunanan: i am not sure how C# works, but i believe that's kind of a proxy
[2015-09-29 16:04:33] jcunanan: yes i believe that's true
[2015-09-29 16:05:33] lukeis, quitting. (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[2015-09-29 16:05:42] dude-x: i believe it will merely behind the scenes invoke findElementBy(Type) but it doesn't do anything special
[2015-09-29 16:05:57] jcunanan: right.. hmm im trying to understand how i'll wrap it
[2015-09-29 16:06:09] jcunanan: the wait is needed after clicks
[2015-09-29 16:06:15] jcunanan: not on finds
[2015-09-29 16:06:28] jcunanan: actions such as clicks, sendkeys
[2015-09-29 16:06:29] jcunanan: etc
[2015-09-29 16:07:02] jcunanan: can i override click()
[2015-09-29 16:07:28] jcunanan: and have my method call Iwebelement.click plus add the waitwebdriver call

[2015-09-29 16:14:04] jcunanan: im redoing my original project, my original project i used the eventfiringwebdriver
[2015-09-29 16:14:15] dude-x: jcunanan: then in your page object, you have method clickRedButton() { elem = findElement...; elem.click(); WebDriverWait();
[2015-09-29 16:14:28] jcunanan: with event handlers for everything
[2015-09-29 16:14:48] dude-x: i think of the event firing webdriver as more of a general thing you want to do, like log stuff somewhere
[2015-09-29 16:15:41] jconstance, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-29 16:15:45] jcunanan: yes i can do it this way
[2015-09-29 16:15:53] jcunanan: then i'd have the webdriverwait() all over the place
[2015-09-29 16:16:01] jcunanan: after every click
[2015-09-29 16:16:38] dude-x: the thing is you may have to wait for different events
[2015-09-29 16:16:53] dude-x: if your app is so general that it can be abstracted to a single function
[2015-09-29 16:16:55] dude-x: then do it
[2015-09-29 16:17:03] dude-x: but that's not my experience
