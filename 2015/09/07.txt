[2015-09-07 10:27:59] smccarthy: Kaylas: that is just one suggestion, to see if maybe you are clicking the Submit button too soon. Adding a static sleep of 5 seconds before interacting with the submit button is an easy way to determine that. If it works, than you know you have to wait for some action before clicking the submit button (so than you can remove the static sleep)

[2015-09-07 12:13:36] pmichelberger: hi, does anyone know if and how a selenium hub could be configured to listen on multiple ports for node registration. something like <hub-ip>:[5555,5556,5557,..]/grid/register

[2015-09-07 12:17:04] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: why does get current url return the current document url not the window.top.location.href? see https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-browser-tools-testing/2015JulSep/0035.html
[2015-09-07 12:17:22] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: I have never noticed before that but that behaviour seems odd
[2015-09-07 12:17:39] simonstewart: Because you want the URL of the document you're interacting with
[2015-09-07 12:17:59] simonstewart: So if you're following the team's advice for (eg) http response codes, it's possible

[2015-09-07 12:18:36] AutomatedTester: *jimevans trolling words detected*
[2015-09-07 12:18:53] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: document.location.href could get that result
[2015-09-07 12:19:13] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: seems interesting to have a dedicated endpoint for it
[2015-09-07 12:19:29] simonstewart: We never used to allow people to execute arbitrary JS
[2015-09-07 12:19:36] AutomatedTester: ahh
[2015-09-07 12:19:38] simonstewart: I fought putting it in for about a year
[2015-09-07 12:19:42] simonstewart: Or maybe longer
[2015-09-07 12:19:56] AutomatedTester: it feels like it should go the same way as element.value
[2015-09-07 12:20:11] simonstewart: I'm not so sure.
[2015-09-07 12:20:23] simonstewart: Perhaps from the wire protocol, but it's damn useful in tests
[2015-09-07 12:20:29] simonstewart: I see it used all the time
[2015-09-07 12:20:44] simonstewart: We also altered how "getAttribute" worked to support the use case that "getValue" supported
[2015-09-07 12:21:34] simonstewart: Making lives easy and pleasant for users was the driving force
[2015-09-07 12:21:38] simonstewart: for the api design

[2015-09-07 12:27:30] AutomatedTester: we can easily leave it in the local end
[2015-09-07 12:27:40] simonstewart: That's the important bit
[2015-09-07 12:27:55] AutomatedTester: that's totally fine
[2015-09-07 12:28:09] AutomatedTester: but looking forward it seems like a redundant API endpoint

[2015-09-07 12:28:44] simonstewart: The assumption being all devices implement JS
[2015-09-07 12:28:48] AutomatedTester: we discussed having page source endpoint removed and being done client side (we have to revisit that because it doesnt work for mobile)
[2015-09-07 12:28:59] simonstewart: You might want to check in the mobile wire protocol
[2015-09-07 12:29:08] AutomatedTester: but for mobile they won't need a get current url
[2015-09-07 12:29:16] simonstewart: They may have overloaded it
[2015-09-07 12:29:23] simonstewart: Jsut as was done with "getAttribute"
[2015-09-07 12:30:42] AutomatedTester: could reply to that w3c thread then since the context of that call (getCurrentUrl) is missing and could be useful
[2015-09-07 12:30:53] simonstewart: Yeah. I'll chime in
[2015-09-07 12:31:00] AutomatedTester: <3

[2015-09-07 12:58:59] simonstewart: Sweet
[2015-09-07 12:59:08] simonstewart: I pushed a couple of fixes today, but nothing majoe
[2015-09-07 12:59:13] barancev: simonstewart: re: getCurrentUrl -- FYI: the exising semantics in the webdriver implementation is to return the current context URL (not the top-level one)
[2015-09-07 12:59:24] simonstewart: barancev: *sigh*
[2015-09-07 12:59:31] simonstewart: We should Do The Right Thing, and fix that
[2015-09-07 12:59:48] barancev: users will be happy :)
[2015-09-07 12:59:50] jimevans: barancev: that's what i thought too.
[2015-09-07 13:00:05] simonstewart: I think the implementation has flip-flopped a couple of time
[2015-09-07 13:00:06] barancev: jimevans: standard is going to change this
[2015-09-07 13:00:12] AutomatedTester: I thought it returned the top level when I wrote
[2015-09-07 13:00:18] jimevans: i've been following the mail thread.
[2015-09-07 13:00:29] *AutomatedTester doesnt mind either way'
[2015-09-07 13:00:29] simonstewart: Top level is the Right Thing to do
[2015-09-07 13:00:30] jimevans: but i've been far too busy to reply
[2015-09-07 13:00:34] simonstewart: For the reason I gave in the email
[2015-09-07 13:01:00] Danjo1, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)

[2015-09-07 13:01:52] AutomatedTester: no it hasnt

[2015-09-07 13:03:53] tiagoboldt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-07 13:03:59] simonstewart: I think most people are using it the way that I described, and if they're not, the JS hack will work
[2015-09-07 13:04:04] jimevans: yeah, there's even a test that getCurrentUrl gives the frame document url
[2015-09-07 13:04:33] jimevans: and now i see that barancev has provided a link to said test.
[2015-09-07 13:04:35] jimevans: don't mind me.
[2015-09-07 13:04:46] AutomatedTester: but that behaviour seems very odd
[2015-09-07 13:05:04] AutomatedTester: it should return top
[2015-09-07 13:05:05] simonstewart: If I had the time, I'd examine the history of that test
[2015-09-07 13:05:58] jimevans: top is the Right Thingâ„¢ because if it's cross-domain, the javascript hack won't work to get the top-level context's url
[2015-09-07 13:06:18] simonstewart: Exactly
[2015-09-07 13:06:23] jimevans: e.g. window.top.document.location
[2015-09-07 13:07:00] jimevans: cross domain frame restrictions suck, but people exploiting them is why we can't have nice things.
[2015-09-07 13:07:04] barancev: simonstewart: instead of driver.get(driver.getCurrentUrl()) a user can call refresh
[2015-09-07 13:07:22] simonstewart: The two are different
[2015-09-07 13:07:38] simonstewart: "Refresh" should cause a form submission to reoccur (if someone's been stupid with their app)
[2015-09-07 13:07:48] simonstewart: Loading the same URL is a different action
[2015-09-07 13:08:59] simonstewart: Ahhh.... managed to fit the default WinXP desktop into my desk
[2015-09-07 13:09:01] simonstewart: deck
[2015-09-07 13:10:01] AutomatedTester: I am so fortunate to have awesome reports
[2015-09-07 13:11:02] AutomatedTester: was wondering what the state of webdriver-rust was and it was released on Friday to crates
[2015-09-07 13:11:05] AutomatedTester: \o.
[2015-09-07 13:11:07] AutomatedTester: \o/
[2015-09-07 13:11:19] barancev: simonstewart: and what about this point: "you want the URL of the document you're interacting with" ?
[2015-09-07 13:11:59] simonstewart: If you ask someone to read you the URL of the page they're currently on, what do they say?
[2015-09-07 13:12:15] jimevans: okay, so the wifi speed here isn't all that great. not that i expected otherwise.
[2015-09-07 13:12:30] jimevans: might be a little delay in getting that buck build tested
[2015-09-07 13:12:53] simonstewart: Ha!
[2015-09-07 13:13:14] jimevans: i had to reinstall my jdk, because i had 7 installed instead of 8
[2015-09-07 13:13:17] jimevans: :-/
[2015-09-07 13:13:24] simonstewart: 7 would be fine
[2015-09-07 13:13:35] simonstewart: It's what we use at work
[2015-09-07 13:13:40] simonstewart: So I know that Buck works with that :)
[2015-09-07 13:13:43] jimevans: git clone of buck is taking a bit.
[2015-09-07 13:14:21] jimevans: i'm getting about 60 k/s
[2015-09-07 13:14:29] simonstewart: Zoinks!
[2015-09-07 13:14:42] simonstewart: Do you think moistening the string a little might help?
[2015-09-07 13:14:43] jimevans: i might could do better on the plane! :)
[2015-09-07 13:17:34] AutomatedTester: jimevans: sent you a PM with a dev version of wires
[2015-09-07 13:18:11] jimevans: downloading now.
[2015-09-07 13:19:24] AutomatedTester: James has added support for adding extensions to wires
[2015-09-07 13:19:34] AutomatedTester: just when I was about to ask him to do that
[2015-09-07 13:19:56] jimevans: should i expect any diagnostic output when i start the exe?
[2015-09-07 13:20:09] jimevans: or should it just sit there waiting for connections?
[2015-09-07 13:20:12] AutomatedTester: um... you may
[2015-09-07 13:20:26] jimevans: (either is fine, i just wanna know what to expect)
[2015-09-07 13:20:31] AutomatedTester: I can't remember
[2015-09-07 13:20:45] AutomatedTester: actually pretty sure you will get it
[2015-09-07 13:21:04] jimevans: i'll figure it out, that's for sure.
[2015-09-07 13:21:11] jimevans: two goals for the week.
[2015-09-07 13:21:30] AutomatedTester: I was hunting a major issue and it was because I was piping stdout
[2015-09-07 13:21:31] jimevans: update the .net bindings to speak w3c, and make progress on buck building .net bindings.
[2015-09-07 13:21:47] barancev: jimevans: no console output until you send a command
[2015-09-07 13:21:49] AutomatedTester: so now push it to a file
[2015-09-07 13:21:56] jimevans: barancev: groovy. thanks.
[2015-09-07 13:22:05] AutomatedTester: at which point it doesnt shut up
[2015-09-07 13:22:05] AutomatedTester: :D
[2015-09-07 13:22:16] jimevans: i'm okay with all of that.
[2015-09-07 13:22:17] jimevans: :)
[2015-09-07 13:22:43] simonstewart: jimevans: I'm going to sit with you and hack on the .net support for buck
[2015-09-07 13:22:58] barancev: AutomatedTester: btw, is it ok that wires does not support /shutdown endpoint?
[2015-09-07 13:23:28] AutomatedTester: barancev: it supports what is documented in the spec :)
[2015-09-07 13:23:58] barancev: it is not selenium command, it is driver server special command
[2015-09-07 13:24:10] barancev: chromedriver and iedriverserver support it
[2015-09-07 13:24:23] jimevans: simonstewart: i'm counting on it. :)
[2015-09-07 13:24:36] barancev: it is a signal to stop the browser and perform cleanup
[2015-09-07 13:24:41] jimevans: MicrosoftWebDriver.exe supports it too.
[2015-09-07 13:24:51] AutomatedTester: we can add it
[2015-09-07 13:25:08] AutomatedTester: all I am saying is that it isnt there now because its not in the spec
