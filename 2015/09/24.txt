[2015-09-24 02:47:07] RedAero: yeah, hence my confusion

[2015-09-24 02:48:00] RedAero: How can I test that it's *actually* switched to the alert I'm looking at? Can I print the contents of the box somehow (which would be useful anyway)?

[2015-09-24 03:06:15] RedAero: although I don't think it can do multiline

[2015-09-24 09:32:24] jimevans: titusfortner: ^^?
[2015-09-24 09:33:05] jimevans: likewise, maybe :enableNativeEvents
[2015-09-24 09:33:11] jimevans: i really don't remember.
[2015-09-24 09:33:16] jimevans: should be an example somewhere.

[2015-09-24 09:44:02] jimevans: native events are very much influenced by browser window focus.
[2015-09-24 09:44:12] jimevans: the above blog posts detail why
[2015-09-24 09:45:06] jimevans: and clever readers will easily deduce why "click doesn't appear to do anything, but i get no failure from webdriver" is a thing

[2015-09-24 09:46:24] ireland: ok. so how do I add the enableNativeEvents option in ruby?
[2015-09-24 09:47:19] titusfortner: I'm still trying to understand why jari separated things out like he did when he wrote this. I don't see a way to pass in arbitrary capabilities and have it get sent over, but I need to step through it again
[2015-09-24 09:47:24] jimevans: well more correctly, you want to *disable* native events. :)
[2015-09-24 09:47:54] titusfortner: At least is goes along with figuring out how to implement a different set of capabilities for w3c

[2015-09-24 13:45:46] yvonneca: but when I use it to start node, it does not show the node in hub's console page
[2015-09-24 13:46:29] yvonneca: what could be the possible reason?
[2015-09-24 13:47:14] AutomatedTester: yvonneca: when you start the node you are telling it to connect to the hub? (silly question but needs asking)
[2015-09-24 13:47:28] yvonneca: yes
[2015-09-24 13:47:38] yvonneca: the hub and port are all correct

[2015-09-24 13:48:08] yvonneca: but don't see it in hub
[2015-09-24 13:48:33] yvonneca: then I stopped my hub and installed that grid-extra jar on my hub machine--ubuntu.
[2015-09-24 13:48:48] yvonneca: what I did was I started hub+node on that ubuntu using grid-extra
[2015-09-24 13:49:09] yvonneca: strangely the hub started but the node on that ubuntu was not started either
[2015-09-24 13:49:38] yvonneca: I followed the questions and entered all the things when first use grid-extra

[2015-09-24 14:17:11] AutomatedTester: joesmith: that way you know that the element you wanted has been removed from the dom
[2015-09-24 14:18:25] joesmith: AutomatedTester: so you're saying *don't* use staleness of, but searching again is better?
