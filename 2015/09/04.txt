[2015-09-04 06:35:59] barancev: please explain
[2015-09-04 06:36:11] AutomatedTester: the window taking commands should be the one handling commands until a switch is made
[2015-09-04 06:36:43] AutomatedTester: if a new tab/window is opened and it happens to be the visibly active tab it might not be the tab active in taking commands
[2015-09-04 06:37:01] AutomatedTester: since there is no explicit switchTo.Window()
[2015-09-04 06:37:09] barancev: so the second tab is visible in foreground, but the first one is "active"
[2015-09-04 06:37:15] AutomatedTester: yes
[2015-09-04 06:37:23] barancev: omg...
[2015-09-04 06:37:38] barancev: ok
[2015-09-04 06:37:38] AutomatedTester: does FirefoxDriver auto switch windows?
[2015-09-04 06:37:53] *AutomatedTester is pretty sure that doesnt happen'
[2015-09-04 06:38:04] barancev: it does not
[2015-09-04 06:38:20] barancev: of course
[2015-09-04 06:38:24] AutomatedTester: does ChromeDriver auto switch windows?
[2015-09-04 06:38:36] AutomatedTester: that uses tabs

[2015-09-04 06:41:57] barancev: AutomatedTester: well, to be more specific: the second click does not work here: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/WindowSwitchingTest.java#L187
[2015-09-04 06:42:10] warfront1, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-04 06:42:56] AutomatedTester: barancev: I would say that is a bug in the test to be honest
[2015-09-04 06:43:10] barancev: by "does not work" I mean it is no-op, there is no exception, but there is no effect too
[2015-09-04 06:43:27] barancev: why the bug in the test?
[2015-09-04 06:43:47] barancev: if the original window is still active, one can perform second action in the same window
[2015-09-04 06:43:59] AutomatedTester: not if you are using "native events"
[2015-09-04 06:44:16] AutomatedTester: hence why I said active is overloaded
[2015-09-04 06:44:36] barancev: it used to pass with native events too
[2015-09-04 06:45:06] AutomatedTester: did native events work on normal element.click or actions.click ?
[2015-09-04 06:45:52] barancev: I mean this exact test
[2015-09-04 06:45:57] barancev: element.click
[2015-09-04 06:45:59] sorinb, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-04 06:46:13] barancev: can't say for sure about actions.click
[2015-09-04 06:46:33] AutomatedTester: I suspect that for element.click we never truly did a "native" click

[2015-09-04 06:48:00] jimevans: g'day everyone
[2015-09-04 06:48:01] barancev: do we claim that it is not possible to perform another click in the *active* window because a new window is opened?
[2015-09-04 06:48:23] AutomatedTester: barancev: the click is happening but the tab is not the browser active one
[2015-09-04 06:48:28] AutomatedTester: so firefox is ignoring it
[2015-09-04 06:48:32] barancev: and one have to switch back to the *same* already active window before continuing?\
[2015-09-04 06:48:55] sircapsalot: hey jimevans
[2015-09-04 06:51:34] AutomatedTester: barancev: we have a choice here... proper clicks or having this test work
[2015-09-04 06:52:35] AutomatedTester: barancev: I am guessing it is probably the same root cause as why it fails on IE

[2015-09-04 08:07:33] sircapsalot: just so you know.. death metal has nothing to do with "death"  :)  it's just the way the music sounds.  "It typically employs heavily distorted and low tuned guitars, played with techniques such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_muting and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremolo_picking, deep https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_growl vocals and screams"

[2015-09-04 08:21:41] barancev: oh..
[2015-09-04 08:22:26] AutomatedTester: normally if wires is erroring like that it is because the spec has a specific name it is expecting

[2015-09-04 11:00:13] jimevans: not even the "miss a payment, your IDE stops working" threat?
[2015-09-04 11:01:07] dude-x: is it a monthly subscription?
[2015-09-04 11:01:16] lukeis: the license server bit is very annoyingâ€¦ don't connect to it in 2 days, you can't use the IDEâ€¦ a few sunday's that's occurred to me

[2015-09-04 11:07:30] D3M0S: is there anything that allows me to continuously use locators instead of WebElements?
[2015-09-04 11:07:49] D3M0S: especially for things like List<WebElement> is there a way to get a List<ElementLocator> instead?
[2015-09-04 11:07:59] D3M0S: or is this basically impossible?
[2015-09-04 11:08:15] jimevans: nothing stopping you from using locators yourself.
[2015-09-04 11:08:24] jleyba: jimevans, you see that thread about firefox support from last night?
[2015-09-04 11:08:38] jimevans: but the WebElement doesn't maintain the locator that was used to find it.
[2015-09-04 11:08:50] jimevans: (and shouldn't, because that leaks the abstraction, imo)
[2015-09-04 11:08:56] D3M0S: jimevans, right...and I agree
[2015-09-04 11:08:58] jimevans: jleyba: yeah i saw it.
[2015-09-04 11:09:11] jimevans: don't really have an opinion one way or the other.
[2015-09-04 11:09:37] jimevans: once we decided to abandon native events, my ability to care about the matter kinda went out the window
[2015-09-04 11:10:03] jleyba: Bringing it up more b/c the original thread (from '12) was dangling the marionette carrot
[2015-09-04 11:10:14] D3M0S: I'm just kinda stuck on how to create a Locator for something like a list of rows in a table without actually accessing the List<WebElement> first
[2015-09-04 11:10:26] jimevans: if/when we move to marionette, it'll matter even less.
[2015-09-04 11:11:06] barancev: when :)
[2015-09-04 11:11:17] barancev: we're on the road
[2015-09-04 11:11:42] jimevans: well, in reality, the "when" is out of necessity, but yes.
[2015-09-04 11:11:52] barancev: the next release will be dedicated to marionette driver
[2015-09-04 11:15:12] titusfortner: Once we get Marionette working, would changing chrome to w3c when google provides that would be relatively simple?
[2015-09-04 11:16:35] barancev: yes, simple
[2015-09-04 11:17:10] titusfortner: Does that mean we'd be looking at a Selenium 4.0 release whenever Google provides that in the chromedriver? :)
[2015-09-04 11:17:34] barancev: first of all we have to kill RC :)
[2015-09-04 11:17:40] jleyba: titusfortner, whoa there, slow down buddy
[2015-09-04 11:17:45] titusfortner: :-D
[2015-09-04 11:17:55] jleyba: selenium 3.0 has to actually ship before you can talk about 4.0
[2015-09-04 11:18:00] titusfortner: does it? ;-)
[2015-09-04 11:18:09] titusfortner: RC doesn't want to die...
[2015-09-04 11:18:20] jimevans: so i once again pose the question. developer channel or nightly channel for marionette work?
[2015-09-04 11:18:23] titusfortner: (not that I can do much to help, so this is super tongue in cheek)
[2015-09-04 11:18:40] barancev: jimevans: right atm nightly only
[2015-09-04 11:18:48] jleyba: RC might not want to die, but we should've killed it by now
[2015-09-04 11:18:57] dude-x: D3M0S: for lists of things that have good decent identifiers you can use xpath and string formatting //div/div/tr[{}]
[2015-09-04 11:20:10] D3M0S: dude-x, ok, I was thinking about maybe querying the object with javascript and then building a locator based on that
[2015-09-04 11:20:43] jleyba: D3M0S, doesn't a table utility class ship wtih selenium?
[2015-09-04 11:20:43] dude-x: D3M0S: it really depends though...
[2015-09-04 11:20:58] D3M0S: jleyba, does it?
[2015-09-04 11:21:06] jimevans: jleyba: in selenium rc. webdriver doesn't have one to my knowledge
[2015-09-04 11:21:08] dude-x: if you have a matrix table, you can do a bit of math to jump to the right column and row
[2015-09-04 11:21:34] jleyba: D3M0S, http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/lift/find/TableFinder.html
[2015-09-04 11:21:55] D3M0S: thanks jleyba and dude-x I'll look into both of those solutions
[2015-09-04 11:22:04] D3M0S: this table stuff has been driving me crazy, they'll all over this site
[2015-09-04 11:24:13] jleyba: jimevans, since I can't go to seconf, can you press Simon for a firm EOL date for SeRC?
[2015-09-04 11:24:40] jimevans: i'll do what i can
[2015-09-04 11:24:47] jimevans: dunno how successful i'll be
[2015-09-04 11:26:02] titusfortner: Is it just things inside the Java jar that has to be disentagled?
[2015-09-04 11:26:09] barancev: I don't understand why we have to support RC in latest selenium release versions
[2015-09-04 11:26:52] barancev: there are no reasons for RC users to upgrade
[2015-09-04 11:27:08] barancev: nothing changes from release to release
[2015-09-04 11:27:32] jimevans: AutomatedTester: 0.3.0 is the latest and greatest wires release, no?
[2015-09-04 11:27:42] barancev: we can appoint any version "the last RC version"
[2015-09-04 11:28:51] barancev: jimevans: yes, 0.3.0 is the latest
[2015-09-04 11:29:56] barancev: today's marionette score: Tests run: 607, Failures: 1, Errors: 20, Time elapsed: 725,834 sec
[2015-09-04 11:29:57] jimevans: i'm planning on doing some .NET bindings updates soon-ish for spec-compliance, and i need a test platform
[2015-09-04 11:30:09] barancev: out of 800 total
[2015-09-04 11:31:19] barancev: jimevans: there are important unrleased changes in rust-webdriver
[2015-09-04 11:31:44] barancev: I hope we'll get wires 0.4.0 soon with these changes
[2015-09-04 11:32:05] jimevans: rust-webdriver? is that wires? or a dependency?
[2015-09-04 11:32:13] barancev: a dependency
[2015-09-04 11:32:29] barancev: https://github.com/jgraham/webdriver-rust/
[2015-09-04 11:32:48] barancev: changed the order of the words, sorry
[2015-09-04 11:32:59] jimevans: yeah, okay, fine.
[2015-09-04 11:34:44] jimevans: AutomatedTester: how likely would it be to get an update to wires released so i don't have to (a) try syncing and building myself, or (b) try to download the update over crappy airplane/hotel/conference wifi?

[2015-09-04 14:15:33] dude-x: then you have to switch back to the parent frame
[2015-09-04 14:16:25] GforOevOerD: dude-x How do I switch the webdriver focus to the frame?
[2015-09-04 14:16:42] dude-x: :apidocs:
[2015-09-04 14:17:14] dude-x: if it's java/c# driver.switchTo.Frame() otherwise driver.switch_to_frame()
[2015-09-04 14:17:44] dude-x: it can accept a webelement or the name of a frame, or an integer representing the child frame (parent is frame 0)
[2015-09-04 14:18:06] GforOevOerD: dude-x Thank you :Exploding from happing after a lot of frustrating times, emoticon!:
[2015-09-04 14:18:09] dude-x: i may be wrong in the actual spelling of the name, s double check that
[2015-09-04 14:18:22] GforOevOerD: dude-x Thank you :Exploding from happiness* after a lot of frustrating times, emoticon!:
[2015-09-04 14:18:44] GforOevOerD: dude-x I will do that. Thank you again
