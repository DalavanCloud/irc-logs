[2015-09-06 06:06:51] jonsch: Hey guys. I am trying to write a bot for the Skype Web Client. I already figured out how to log in and send chat messages with Selenium but not how to analyze the incoming messages in one chatroom. I figured out the Adress in the HTML Code of the Website where the newest message is always located: http://i.imgur.com/HcBc9WA.jpg  I cant figure out tho how to save the string with the message. Any ideas?
[2015-09-06 06:09:47] jonsch: Edit: newest = browser.find_element_by_class_name('offScreen')  and  newest.get_Attribute("role") do not work because the class offScreen is used several times and that only returns the string saved in the first offscreen class
[2015-09-06 06:10:05] jonsch: also it returns the string contained by "" and not < >
[2015-09-06 06:11:03] jonsch: I heard that you can use .text to get the value of a text node but to use it i would have to save the right element at first
[2015-09-06 06:11:07] jonsch: which i cant figure out

[2015-09-06 06:35:03] jonsch: there was skype4py
[2015-09-06 06:35:20] jonsch: but now group chats are cloud based rather than peer to peer
[2015-09-06 06:35:31] jonsch: so all those dont work anymore
