[2015-09-28 09:02:40] dude-x: how do you know firefox is pasting as opposed to typing one by one?

[2015-09-28 09:11:48] Halobit: dude-x, I want to simulate human typing behaviour on Selenium.
[2015-09-28 09:12:15] dude-x: so you want to really have millisecond delays between each keys?

[2015-09-28 09:13:27] dude-x: Halobit: you want to have noticeable delays between each key?
[2015-09-28 09:13:51] Halobit: dude-x, Yes, like 30-40 ms between each typing
[2015-09-28 09:14:56] dude-x: you would write a function like this then. if you have a list of strings, then you should just do for word in list_str: for char in word: elem.send_keys(char); time.sleep(30)
[2015-09-28 09:15:21] jimevans: Halobit: you'll need to write custom code to make that happen. there is no mechanism to insert delays in processing of commands, nor during the processing of a single command, like sendKeys. furthermore, there won't be such a mechanism added to the API, as it runs counter to the purpose of enabling code to run as fast as possible.
[2015-09-28 09:15:51] dude-x: err time.sleep(0.030)
[2015-09-28 09:16:57] jimevans: the only conceivable valid use case for something like that is if there's some javascript processing that happens upon every single keystroke, and even then, it's probably covered by sending all of the keystrokes as one batch with no pausing in between. if that makes a difference, then it's a very, very poorly designed javascript widget.
[2015-09-28 09:17:17] dude-x: Halobit: webdriver internally does send one key at time, but as fast as possible.

[2015-09-28 11:07:33] dhoer: it would be part of the selenium node install

[2015-09-28 11:10:00] dhoer: so it will have to monitor on hub and trigger a reboot on node
[2015-09-28 11:11:12] dimacus: yup that's how i do it in grid extras now
[2015-09-28 11:11:30] lukeis: you could write your own code to inject in the node, that looks at the .quit() and does your custom logic if it should rebootâ€¦ but I'd tend to go with the other approach dima is talking about :)
[2015-09-28 11:12:18] dimacus: dhoer: i have a custom Proxy that overwrites the afterSession() and determins if it's time to reboot or not. If it is, it sends a reboot command to the node https://github.com/groupon/Selenium-Grid-Extras/blob/master/SeleniumGridExtras/src/main/java/com/groupon/seleniumgridextras/grid/proxies/SetupTeardownProxy.java#L176-L185

[2015-09-28 13:12:28] kallisti: Hey, so what's going on in the wire protocol, if anything, when you run this in Python: driver.switch_to.alert
[2015-09-28 13:12:43] dude-x: kallisti: driver.switch_to_alert()
[2015-09-28 13:13:02] dude-x: kallisti: is there a problem with the actual command sent by python?
[2015-09-28 13:13:05] kallisti: no
[2015-09-28 13:13:14] kallisti: I wasn't aware of a "switch to alert" command in the wire stuff.
[2015-09-28 13:14:39] lukeis: kallisti: in pythonâ€¦ driver.switch_to.alert does no wire call :)
[2015-09-28 13:14:54] lukeis: it just returns an Alert object
[2015-09-28 13:14:55] kallisti: ah okay. so it just updates some internal state
[2015-09-28 13:15:00] kallisti: I see
[2015-09-28 13:15:22] lukeis: the alert object and then do:  accept, dismiss, send_keys, (get) text
[2015-09-28 13:15:40] lukeis: and newly added, but only works in IE, authenticate
[2015-09-28 13:16:00] kallisti: I'm finally getting around to adding some convenient "expected conditions" stuff to the Haskell bindings.
[2015-09-28 13:16:24] lukeis: in java,  driver.switchTo().alert()  implicitly calls alert.getText()
[2015-09-28 13:16:42] kallisti: does the alert object have some kind of understand of WHICH alert it is? in other words, say you return an alert object, then dismiss the alert, then a new alert appears, what happens if you call dismiss() on the old alert object?
[2015-09-28 13:17:14] lukeis: the alert object is not tied to an actual alert, that example would dismiss the new alert
[2015-09-28 13:17:25] kallisti: alright
[2015-09-28 13:17:39] barancev: he-he, the latest jetty requires Java 8

[2015-09-28 13:17:59] kallisti: thanks for the help. That pretty much tells me everything I need to know.
[2015-09-28 13:18:05] lukeis: barancev: lucky you i just fixed all the broken javadoc ;)
[2015-09-28 13:20:21] kallisti: basically all I need to do is have an "expectAlertPresent" that does the alert text wire call and catches AlertNotPresent

[2015-09-28 13:34:28] lukeis: kallisti: nothing it calls would result in that exception being thrown
[2015-09-28 13:34:29] dude-x: kallisti: it calls _element_if_visilbe
[2015-09-28 13:34:44] lukeis: AutomatedTester: i don't think so
[2015-09-28 13:34:49] kallisti: ah okay. what things would throw element not visible then?
[2015-09-28 13:34:51] dude-x: that too; no exceptions there
[2015-09-28 13:35:01] dude-x: kallisti: .text .click .send_keys
[2015-09-28 13:35:08] lukeis: kallisti: element.click() or another interaction like send_keys
[2015-09-28 13:35:14] lukeis: dude-x: not .text
[2015-09-28 13:35:22] dude-x: lukeis: you sure about .terxt?
[2015-09-28 13:35:23] dude-x: hmm
[2015-09-28 13:35:25] lukeis: yes
[2015-09-28 13:35:32] dude-x: that's interersting...
[2015-09-28 13:35:40] lukeis: it will return an empty string
[2015-09-28 13:38:52] AutomatedTester: so, should we move to 2.48 with this next release/
[2015-09-28 13:38:58] dude-x: lukeis: yeah you're right.
[2015-09-28 13:40:52] kallisti: yeah so I don't really need an analogous for visibility_of_element_located because the libary already lets you write:  expect =<< isDisplay element
[2015-09-28 13:41:17] kallisti: all I need to add special functions for are conditions where you need to catch a specific error, mostly StaleElementReference
[2015-09-28 13:41:33] kallisti: *analog
[2015-09-28 13:41:57] kallisti: *isDisplayed

[2015-09-28 13:42:11] titusfortner: Was the idea for 2.48 to have Marionette support included?
[2015-09-28 13:42:42] AutomatedTester: titusfortner: not necessarily but I am doing a release

[2015-09-28 13:51:33] jimevans: the next question is should i submit a bug to add a /status end point?
[2015-09-28 13:52:30] AutomatedTester: jimevans: submit it to the specification
[2015-09-28 13:52:34] AutomatedTester: the bug
[2015-09-28 13:52:38] jimevans: copy that.
[2015-09-28 13:52:54] AutomatedTester: it's not in marionette because it is not in the spec
[2015-09-28 13:53:01] jimevans: right. i figured.
[2015-09-28 13:53:12] jimevans: but /shutdown appears to beâ€¦ :)
[2015-09-28 13:53:18] jimevans: or maybe not.
[2015-09-28 13:53:23] jimevans: i could be wrong.
[2015-09-28 13:53:26] AutomatedTester: I dont think so
[2015-09-28 13:53:46] jimevans: does quitting the session cause the executable to terminate?

[2015-09-28 13:54:31] jimevans: yeah, but the shim exits too.
[2015-09-28 13:54:39] jimevans: let me take a quick look
[2015-09-28 13:54:51] AutomatedTester: hmmm... I think I might have broken my toe...
[2015-09-28 13:55:06] lukeis: that's suboptimal
[2015-09-28 13:55:16] AutomatedTester: indeed
