[2015-09-30 00:14:58] Venus_Mars: With Selenium we create a IE8 browser and goto "XYZ" url, the window closes and it opens the website in a new popUp.
[2015-09-30 00:15:30] Venus_Mars: then the selenium is throwing error: assert_exists browser is closed
[2015-09-30 00:15:52] Venus_Mars: how should we go to new popUp window ?
[2015-09-30 00:16:13] titusfortner: what language?
[2015-09-30 00:17:07] titusfortner: there is going to be some call that you can get a list of window handles, and then another call you can make to switch to an existing window handle
[2015-09-30 00:26:30] Venus_Mars: ruby

[2015-09-30 03:22:08] testman: dear expert, good day
[2015-09-30 03:23:02] testman: in my application, there is a middleware without UI, please advise how the middleware could be tested in Selenium testing fraemwork? thanks.
[2015-09-30 03:24:42] WhereIsMySpoon: testman: what is this "middleware"? is this a web app?
[2015-09-30 03:26:18] testman: it is part of web app, but it has no UI.
[2015-09-30 03:26:53] WhereIsMySpoon: testman: im sorry you aren't making a lot of sense, this thing you want to test, what is it?
[2015-09-30 03:27:35] nonny_t, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-30 03:29:10] testman: when user client a button in browser, it will call the middleware, and the middle ware will call 3rd party system to calculate data and send to downstream system. the middleware has no UI but we are requested to do auto-testing in selenium framework
[2015-09-30 03:29:54] drptbl: it looks like api testing is what u're looking for?
[2015-09-30 03:30:21] WhereIsMySpoon: testman: selenium is not going to help you there
[2015-09-30 03:30:26] WhereIsMySpoon: you want api-based testing
[2015-09-30 03:30:32] testman: sort of
[2015-09-30 03:30:37] nonny_t, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-09-30 03:30:40] drptbl: WhereIsMySpoon: +1
[2015-09-30 03:31:06] WhereIsMySpoon: testman: selenium when used for testing is for UI based, end-to-end UI testing
[2015-09-30 03:31:12] WhereIsMySpoon: uh, i repeated myself
[2015-09-30 03:31:13] WhereIsMySpoon: but yea
[2015-09-30 03:31:25] drptbl: yeah it looks like u're trying to test something which has no UI with UI testing tool ^^
[2015-09-30 03:31:45] simonstewart, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-30 03:31:49] testman: yes, will selenium support the auto-testing without UI?
[2015-09-30 03:31:49] WhereIsMySpoon: you either want unit tests on the middleware itself or you want to use some sort of test application that can send api requests
[2015-09-30 03:32:00] WhereIsMySpoon: testman: we just all answerered that, no
[2015-09-30 03:32:28] WhereIsMySpoon: testman:selenium is for testing websites, not for testing middleware that receives api requests
[2015-09-30 03:32:35] WhereIsMySpoon: these are totally different things
[2015-09-30 03:33:18] WhereIsMySpoon: or let me be more generic, selenium is for automating browser interaction
[2015-09-30 03:33:39] testman: Got it, cleare, can you give your recommendation for the middleware testing?
[2015-09-30 03:33:41] WhereIsMySpoon: note "browser"
[2015-09-30 03:33:46] WhereIsMySpoon: nope, not a clue

[2015-09-30 05:14:28] WhereIsMySpoon: from what i see
[2015-09-30 05:14:41] WhereIsMySpoon: or did you mean 8.1.9
[2015-09-30 05:15:06] barancev: 9.2.12
[2015-09-30 05:15:12] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2015-09-30 05:15:15] WhereIsMySpoon: well whatever
[2015-09-30 05:15:16] barancev: to be compatible with HtmlUNit

[2015-09-30 05:18:12] WhereIsMySpoon: let me guess, jetty 7 uses 3.0.1
[2015-09-30 05:18:25] barancev: jetty 7 uses 2.5
[2015-09-30 05:18:45] barancev: and this part is bit harder to upgrade...

[2015-09-30 09:25:08] jimevans: so basic marionette support in .NET is easily doable
[2015-09-30 09:25:19] jimevans: well not easily, but i have it working locally in a branch
[2015-09-30 09:25:41] jimevans: AutomatedTester: does marionette support custom profile settings? if so, how are they propagated to the driver?
[2015-09-30 09:25:54] AutomatedTester: jimevans: not atm
[2015-09-30 09:26:01] AutomatedTester: we should add that

[2015-09-30 09:27:59] jimevans: i'd guess people are going to want to customize their profiles for use with marionette, so yeah. but that's on y'all to figure out how to propagate that to the driver (via capabilities, i'm sure, but what the format is, that's another matter).

[2015-09-30 09:33:44] mekdev: I wanted to do this   var apiResponse = yield someHttpRequest(); from inside  test.it("Test Name", function* () {};
[2015-09-30 09:33:59] WhereIsMySpoon: mekdev: have you tried it?
[2015-09-30 09:34:07] mekdev: we are heavily using the provided test wrapper
[2015-09-30 09:34:09] mekdev: yes i have
[2015-09-30 09:34:34] mekdev: it dies at the start of the generator function

[2015-09-30 09:36:25] mekdev: inside we opt for co-requests which are all generator calls
[2015-09-30 09:37:05] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont know if there's a mocha chat or forum but i think it would be better to ask there or maybe on stackoverflow

[2015-09-30 10:17:04] titusfortner: Sure... I don't know what \r is, should look that up...
[2015-09-30 10:17:50] jimevans: \r is carriage return. character 0x13.
[2015-09-30 10:17:54] titusfortner: oh windows thing
[2015-09-30 10:17:55] jimevans: bah
[2015-09-30 10:18:03] titusfortner: got it, cool
[2015-09-30 10:18:13] jimevans: 0xD
[2015-09-30 10:18:30] titusfortner: yes, so I'm getting carriage returns and spaces when calling for text in elements that don't have white spaces
[2015-09-30 10:18:34] jimevans: but yeah. windows line termination.
[2015-09-30 10:19:13] titusfortner: Reading the w3c spec makes it seem like this might be correct behavior
[2015-09-30 10:19:35] titusfortner: but current firefox & chrome definitely don't do this
[2015-09-30 10:21:06] jimevans: nope. using the xpath normalize-space function should collapse multiple whitespaces into single ones (which would collapse \r\n into \n).
[2015-09-30 10:21:20] jimevans: which is step 3 of the algorithm
[2015-09-30 10:21:54] titusfortner: right, but collapsing doesn't get rid of them, just results in one trailing?
[2015-09-30 10:22:19] jimevans: also step 2.1.2 of the algorithm explicitly collapses \r\n to \n.
[2015-09-30 10:22:26] titusfortner: so I should never see \

[2015-09-30 11:50:32] simonstewart: and sticking on 2.x doesn't help them
[2015-09-30 11:50:43] barancev: it helps a lot :)
[2015-09-30 11:50:56] simonstewart: They miss out on bug fixes we put into webdriver
[2015-09-30 11:51:10] barancev: whereas providing an ability to run RC does not help
[2015-09-30 11:51:11] simonstewart: Awful customer experience
[2015-09-30 11:51:22] simonstewart: They need to jump through the required hoop
[2015-09-30 11:51:27] barancev: they will run RC instead of migrating to WebDriver
[2015-09-30 11:51:30] barancev: because they can
[2015-09-30 11:51:33] simonstewart: Which is fine
[2015-09-30 11:51:45] simonstewart: Because we don't want to force people to rewrite every single test they have
[2015-09-30 11:51:52] simonstewart: It's a waste of effort
[2015-09-30 11:51:54] barancev: so let them use 2.x
[2015-09-30 11:52:03] simonstewart: Which won't work in the future
[2015-09-30 11:52:10] simonstewart: Because of the w3c spec work

[2015-09-30 11:52:46] barancev: the client API is the same
[2015-09-30 11:52:57] titusfortner: unless you restrict your tests to using 3 year old versions of Firefox like some people do :)
[2015-09-30 11:52:58] simonstewart: The wire protocol isn't
[2015-09-30 11:53:15] barancev: they should not care about the protocol
[2015-09-30 11:53:22] barancev: because they use API
[2015-09-30 11:53:36] simonstewart: But the API is backed by the protocol
[2015-09-30 11:53:41] barancev: so what?
[2015-09-30 11:53:54] simonstewart: As we move from 2.x to 3.x to 4.x we don't want to force people to rewrite tests
[2015-09-30 11:53:59] simonstewart: Because they won't do it
[2015-09-30 11:54:02] simonstewart: and we stall adoption
[2015-09-30 11:54:13] barancev: they'll have to rewrite them if they use RC
[2015-09-30 11:54:22] simonstewart: no they don't
[2015-09-30 11:54:26] simonstewart: they just drop in leg-rc
[2015-09-30 11:54:33] simonstewart: which will use the webdriver-apis
[2015-09-30 11:54:45] simonstewart: so that needs to be updated almost never
[2015-09-30 11:54:54] simonstewart: (only if we introduce a breaking change in the webdriver apis)
[2015-09-30 11:55:44] barancev: I don't believe in WDBS
[2015-09-30 11:55:54] simonstewart: OK
[2015-09-30 11:55:58] simonstewart: That's a different thing entirely
[2015-09-30 11:56:25] simonstewart: Put yourself in the shoes of the user
[2015-09-30 11:56:41] simonstewart: Even google didn't have the resources to rewrite all their tests
[2015-09-30 11:56:47] barancev: a user that has a lot of RC tests?

[2015-09-30 11:56:53] simonstewart: Exactly
[2015-09-30 11:57:07] barancev: that wants to run them with the newest webdriver
[2015-09-30 11:57:12] simonstewart: Right

[2015-09-30 11:57:25] barancev: this is what WDBS is for, no?
[2015-09-30 11:57:37] juangj: simonstewart: we're almost rid of RC tests! almost.
[2015-09-30 11:57:37] simonstewart: I feel like we're going round in circles
[2015-09-30 11:57:47] simonstewart: barancev: see^^
[2015-09-30 11:57:51] Sangram, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2015-09-30 11:58:02] simonstewart: And they had a pretty hefty chunk of the selenium committer team working there
[2015-09-30 11:58:10] simonstewart: New tests get the new API
[2015-09-30 11:58:14] simonstewart: Old tests are still run
[2015-09-30 11:58:17] juangj: we're "rid" of it but there is some WDBS stuff still floating around
[2015-09-30 11:58:25] juangj: and a lot of dependencies that we want to axe
[2015-09-30 11:58:29] juangj: but who has time
[2015-09-30 11:58:35] simonstewart: This! This is my point
[2015-09-30 11:58:47] simonstewart: This is why we can't just tell people to "rewrite everything"
[2015-09-30 11:58:56] simonstewart: Or "stick with an antiquated version"
[2015-09-30 11:58:58] barancev: simonstewart: I don't understand what "entirely different" thing do you mean, sorry
[2015-09-30 11:59:14] barancev: I understand the WDBS idea
[2015-09-30 11:59:33] barancev: but how is it related to the server part?
[2015-09-30 11:59:42] barancev: let's remove RC completely from the server
[2015-09-30 11:59:44] simonstewart: You said you "didn't believe in WDBS". Agreeing whether or not it works in your case isn't the same as saying it doesn't work globally
[2015-09-30 12:00:03] simonstewart: barancev: see above
[2015-09-30 12:00:13] simonstewart: I've already covered that
[2015-09-30 12:02:13] barancev: ok, I've got it, but I still don't think it is worth
[2015-09-30 12:02:36] simonstewart: I know :)
[2015-09-30 12:02:59] simonstewart: I've had plenty of people try and beat me up about leaving them high-and-dry at conferences

[2015-09-30 12:09:56] barancev: and I did not run these tests in Chrome
[2015-09-30 12:10:21] barancev: well, ok, back to the server part
[2015-09-30 12:10:47] barancev: why do we need the server that can serve both WebDriver and RC requests?

[2015-09-30 13:56:41] Thunderforge: Hello. I'm having an issue with Selenium Webdriver on Firefox 40.
[2015-09-30 13:57:12] Thunderforge: After going to a new page, I get JavaScript Error: "can't access dead object" selenium
[2015-09-30 13:57:20] Thunderforge: This doesn't happen on Firefox 36, the last version we tried.
[2015-09-30 13:57:55] Thunderforge: It seems almost identical to an issue that happened with Firefox 18 in 2012.

[2015-09-30 13:58:46] Thunderforge: I would imagine that others have tried to use Firefox 40.

[2015-09-30 14:06:49] Thunderforge: barancev: Latest version: 2.47.1
[2015-09-30 14:06:52] Thunderforge: For java
[2015-09-30 14:07:22] barancev: yes, then, report a :newissue
[2015-09-30 14:08:23] Thunderforge: The website I am currently testing on is confidential. Will that be a problem?

[2015-09-30 14:08:44] Thunderforge: Do I need to find another situation where this will happen?
[2015-09-30 14:08:53] Thunderforge: As a test case.

[2015-09-30 14:09:08] Thunderforge: Or will a stack trace be sufficient
[2015-09-30 14:09:25] Thunderforge: (I'm kind of new to the open source world)
[2015-09-30 14:09:50] barancev: Thunderforge: use jsfiddle or jsbin to create a simplified sample page
[2015-09-30 14:10:29] plujon: Using selenium, is it possible to tell whether an IMG has loaded successfully in a web page?
[2015-09-30 14:10:29] Thunderforge: It appears to happen with multiple tabs. Can those handle them? I didn't think they could
[2015-09-30 14:10:56] barancev: Thunderforge: tabs are not supported
[2015-09-30 14:11:11] barancev: plujon: in general, no
[2015-09-30 14:11:22] dude-x: plujon: you can use executeScript to check the size
[2015-09-30 14:11:31] barancev: Thunderforge: if you are talking about browser tabs
[2015-09-30 14:11:34] Thunderforge: barancev: Okay, so I won't be able to create a test case unless I can find a site that this will work on.
[2015-09-30 14:11:37] Thunderforge: Yes, browser tabs
[2015-09-30 14:11:40] santiycr, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2015-09-30 14:11:50] barancev: Thunderforge: use windows instead of tabs
[2015-09-30 14:11:59] jcunanan: hi dude-x
[2015-09-30 14:12:09] barancev: dude-x: img size can be preset
[2015-09-30 14:12:15] dude-x: oh.
[2015-09-30 14:12:26] Thunderforge: Oh, just saw the release notes and I see that Selenium 2.47 only works up to Firefox 39. Are there already efforts to make the next version compatible to Firefox 40?
[2015-09-30 14:12:28] dude-x: well there goes that idea.
[2015-09-30 14:12:29] jcunanan: dude-x: i followed your advice for wrapping click into my own clickmethod which included a custom wait
[2015-09-30 14:12:33] jcunanan: and that worked

[2015-09-30 14:12:48] dude-x: jcunanan: no problem. :)
[2015-09-30 14:12:56] barancev: 2.47 works with FF41
[2015-09-30 14:12:58] jcunanan: :P
[2015-09-30 14:13:14] Thunderforge: Really? Hmm, I wonder why I'm having the error then.
[2015-09-30 14:13:28] barancev: up to FF43
[2015-09-30 14:14:09] Thunderforge: I'll have to look into it then. It only happened once I upgraded Firefox.
[2015-09-30 14:14:18] plujon: dude-x: Ah, interesting idea.  I do have control over the web page and could leave the size unset in the img tag.
[2015-09-30 14:14:30] barancev: well, simonstewart broke file uploading...
[2015-09-30 14:14:33] Thunderforge: barancev: Thank you for clarifying the current support for Firefox.
[2015-09-30 14:15:14] dude-x: plujon: i have checked x and y > 0 and something else.
[2015-09-30 14:16:24] dude-x: can't remember what other property i've checked.
[2015-09-30 14:18:17] plujon: dude-x: Thanks; I'll play around and see what works.
