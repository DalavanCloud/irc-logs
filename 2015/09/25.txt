[2015-09-25 01:55:08] terrid: The problem is, the rows could become in the 1000s and simply looping through a CSV and opening the page, scraping and then going to the next row could potentially take a long time

[2015-09-25 02:24:09] RedAero: What would be the best way to ignore NoSuchElement errors in a function and carry on with the code?
[2015-09-25 02:27:03] drptbl, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-25 02:33:15] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: whats the use case and I can help you further
[2015-09-25 02:33:31] WhereIsMySpoon: I have a couple ideas just wanna see what you're doing
[2015-09-25 02:37:10] RedAero: WhereIsMySpoon: I'm simply filling a form, and I don't want the thing to stop if it can't find a dropdown or text box or whatever
[2015-09-25 02:37:39] sgsabbage: try{}catch{}
[2015-09-25 02:37:40] sgsabbage: :D
[2015-09-25 02:37:55] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2015-09-25 02:37:57] WhereIsMySpoon: p much
[2015-09-25 02:38:18] RedAero: Python only has try-except, and that still halts on an exception
[2015-09-25 02:38:23] WhereIsMySpoon: usually when you write tests you're writing for a set workflow where there isn't a chance that something may or may not be there
[2015-09-25 02:38:37] WhereIsMySpoon: apart from timing isuses
[2015-09-25 02:38:39] RedAero: I'd have to put every single line in its own try-except block...
[2015-09-25 02:38:58] nakilon: omitted custom "profile", so my json looks as this: {"desiredCapabilities":{"browserName":"firefox","version":"","platform":"ANY","javascriptEnabled":true,"cssSelectorsEnabled":true,"takesScreenshot":true,"nativeEvents":false,"rotatable":false}}
[2015-09-25 02:39:00] RedAero: WhereIsMySpoon: Timing issues is exactly what I expect, and this isn't for testing anyway, it's work automation
[2015-09-25 02:39:11] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: yes, timing issues are fine, then you can use waits
[2015-09-25 02:39:25] nakilon: and still Selenium::WebDriver::Error::UnknownError: Bad request Command duration or timeout: 231 milliseconds on POSTing that json
[2015-09-25 02:40:02] RedAero: WhereIsMySpoon: Again, that'd mean a wait added to every line (because apparently implicit waits are the devil), and then I might as well use try
[2015-09-25 02:40:20] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: or you can spend a little time making a few wrapper methods
[2015-09-25 02:40:22] sgsabbage: why not use a wrapper function?
[2015-09-25 02:40:23] sgsabbage: yeah
[2015-09-25 02:40:34] RedAero: for the waits you mean?
[2015-09-25 02:40:39] WhereIsMySpoon: like waitClickableThenClick(WebElement toClick, int timeToWait)
[2015-09-25 02:40:46] RedAero: but in any case, I don't want to use waits
[2015-09-25 02:41:01] WhereIsMySpoon: that does an explicit wait, then clicsk
[2015-09-25 02:41:02] RedAero: because that effectively still halts if the element genuinely isn't there for whatever reason
[2015-09-25 02:41:05] WhereIsMySpoon: clicks*
[2015-09-25 02:41:09] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: thats a different issue
[2015-09-25 02:41:26] RedAero: I simply want to ignore not found errors
[2015-09-25 02:41:57] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: cant you use try/except with pass

[2015-09-25 02:42:54] WhereIsMySpoon: umm
[2015-09-25 02:43:00] RedAero: yeup
[2015-09-25 02:43:23] RedAero: 3.4 is supposed to have a suppress() clause, but I'm on 2.7
[2015-09-25 02:44:36] RedAero: if there was some way to loop over code line-by-line...
[2015-09-25 02:44:54] RedAero: s/loop/iterate
[2015-09-25 02:44:55] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: there isnt a solution for your issue that doesn't involve caring for each issue, it would be the same as having multiple paths in your code and having to do if/else

[2015-09-25 02:47:54] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: thats how normal programming workflow works yes
[2015-09-25 02:47:56] RedAero: at least Python does inline code well so it might not look horrendous
[2015-09-25 02:48:18] qwebirc90431: I am going to start using selenium, is better to use python ruby or java?
[2015-09-25 02:48:22] RedAero: WhereIsMySpoon: Other languages have continuation or error suppression, Python will too
[2015-09-25 02:48:39] WhereIsMySpoon: qwebirc6656: use whatever language either you are familiar with or your co-workers are familiar with or that integrates well with your code base

[2015-09-25 02:50:01] RedAero: By the way, it'd be neat to add this functionality to Selenium if not to Python itself
[2015-09-25 02:50:14] qwebirc90431: ok ty
[2015-09-25 02:50:29] sgsabbage: RedAero: There is a way you can do it with selenium actually
[2015-09-25 02:50:35] sgsabbage: use elements() rather than element()
[2015-09-25 02:50:38] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2015-09-25 02:50:39] RedAero: Maybe a simple setting that causes find_ functions to return some null value when they would otherwise return a NoSuchElement error
[2015-09-25 02:50:42] sgsabbage: and count the number of elements returned
[2015-09-25 02:50:45] WhereIsMySpoon: but thats the same as try/except
[2015-09-25 02:50:52] WhereIsMySpoon: cause he has to do it every time still
[2015-09-25 02:50:54] RedAero: sgsabbage: hey, that's not a bad idea
[2015-09-25 02:51:04] sgsabbage: hm, that's true
[2015-09-25 02:51:08] RedAero: there might be something there...
[2015-09-25 02:51:11] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: they dont -return- the error, its an exception
[2015-09-25 02:51:25] RedAero: whatever
[2015-09-25 02:51:28] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: you told it to find something that doesnt exist
[2015-09-25 02:51:41] WhereIsMySpoon: therefore that is an exceptional case and needs to alert the user that they did something wrong or something went wrong
[2015-09-25 02:51:59] RedAero: by default yes
[2015-09-25 02:52:07] RedAero: but in my case, that's not necessary

[2015-09-25 02:52:40] RedAero: I don't expect this to run flawlessly due to the shittyness of the underlying webpage and general environment
[2015-09-25 02:52:55] RedAero: so I don't want it to halt every time there's a hiccup
[2015-09-25 02:53:50] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: the problem there is that you're using an api primarily used for testing to run something that is bad and needs improving and are trying to incorporate multiple workflows into one test
[2015-09-25 02:54:00] WhereIsMySpoon: you're going against the stream

[2015-09-25 02:55:16] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: if you dont want exceptions, you could try to jerry rig to turn them off
[2015-09-25 02:55:19] RedAero: WhereIsMySpoon: I would never have tried selenium if people didn't tell me constantly to use it...
[2015-09-25 02:55:39] WhereIsMySpoon: RedAero: its decent for what you want to do, its just not gonna be 100%
[2015-09-25 02:56:37] RedAero: Luckily I'm only hoping for "barely works", not "fully-featured product ready for release" :D
[2015-09-25 02:56:43] WhereIsMySpoon: :D

[2015-09-25 13:23:45] dp: lukeis: Then what's the purpose of the IDE?
[2015-09-25 13:23:47] dude-x: after i close Firefox, a few minutes later the active memory of the kernel task drops back to about 1GB
[2015-09-25 13:23:52] dude-x: which is typical
[2015-09-25 13:24:01] AutomatedTester: mine is at 1.26GB
[2015-09-25 13:24:21] AutomatedTester: and I have DevEdition at nearly 2GB (I have a lot of tabs open)

[2015-09-25 13:24:48] lukeis: dp: to possible teach people how to do test automation? i'm not sure, i avoid record / playback tools, but people seem to want them… i'd rather write my automation (and you should be using WebDriver)
[2015-09-25 13:24:59] titusfortner: dp: IDE is a great choice for automating something super simple that isn't going to change, or to better learn about how automation works, but it is based on an outdated library
[2015-09-25 13:25:02] dude-x: AutomatedTester: it should be roughly 800MB-1.5 GB during typical use.
[2015-09-25 13:25:07] dude-x: even if you don't reboot for months
[2015-09-25 13:25:14] AutomatedTester: I rarely reboot
[2015-09-25 13:25:34] AutomatedTester: I restart Firefox every so often (when I see prompts for updates)
[2015-09-25 13:25:43] dude-x: Chrome use to be an offender, but now Firefox is doing it after Chrome fixed it (or I fixed chrome with the process suspender extension "The Great Suspender")
