[2015-09-14 08:48:52] D3M0S: either way, I did find these 2 without states, and was wondering if it might be an issue

[2015-09-14 08:50:10] lukeis: for the other, worst thing I could see is it returning the state as "null"

[2015-09-14 09:46:52] WhereIsMySpoon: D3M0S: if it only appears after doing an action, then you probably dont want it as a webelement
[2015-09-14 09:46:54] D3M0S: I think there is, because while playing with it, I've had Stale Element exceptions, that have been cured by trying a 200 ms sleep within the decorator.

[2015-09-14 09:56:50] D3M0S: in all framworks, you are generally expeceted to provide your own explicit waits, or set an implicit wait on the webdriver object
[2015-09-14 09:56:52] aumberg: all work but with more code writings
[2015-09-14 09:57:08] jleyba: That's working as intended

[2015-09-14 09:59:02] WhereIsMySpoon: aumberg: you need to tell your tests when to wait and what to do, the reason why is that selenium acts like a user does, except a user knows to wait because they can see with their eyes that they cant click on stuff. WebDriver can't see cause it doesnt have eyes, you need to -tell- it that stuff isn't ready for it yet

[2015-09-14 09:59:46] aumberg: operations
[2015-09-14 09:59:46] WhereIsMySpoon: aumberg: for most stuff yes, and that's normal
[2015-09-14 10:00:13] D3M0S: aumberg, it's not feasible to discount 10% of operations in order to solve 90% of operations
[2015-09-14 10:00:14] WhereIsMySpoon: a user cant click on a button that isnt clickable or visible
[2015-09-14 10:00:42] *lukeis going to implement a 90% of the time check for visibility on find elements ;)'
[2015-09-14 10:00:50] D3M0S: so Selenium gives you the ability to do 100% of operations, and leaves it up to you to solve your own halting issues
[2015-09-14 10:01:31] jleyba: WhereIsMySpoon, "isn't clickable" depends on your definition of clickable

[2015-09-14 10:03:52] D3M0S: this is my interpretation
[2015-09-14 10:04:15] qwebirc76426: shadowdom allows for custom creation of DOM elements, so you can have multiple elements with the same #id that don't conflict with each other, and also so other things in the DOM can't interfere with them
[2015-09-14 10:04:16] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2015-09-14 10:04:36] WhereIsMySpoon: qwebirc76426: that sounds...weird...why not just not use the same id and use another identifier
[2015-09-14 10:04:52] jleyba: WhereIsMySpoon, shadow dom is an attempt to bring encapsulation to HTML
[2015-09-14 10:05:07] dude-x: qwebirc76426: sounds like you may have to use executescript to interact with it; there is little support for it in selenium at the moment

[2015-09-14 11:18:19] lukeis: throwing out other ideas…. don't use an authenticated proxy?! :)
[2015-09-14 11:18:28] D3M0S: duriangray, I wrote my own browsermob type proxy ontop of little-proxy so....yeah.
[2015-09-14 11:19:03] duriangray: is it possible just to ssh the whole server into the proxy?
[2015-09-14 11:19:18] D3M0S: duriangray, which server?
[2015-09-14 11:19:20] duriangray: then run selenium through that tunnel
[2015-09-14 11:19:29] D3M0S: the proxy server?
[2015-09-14 11:19:32] duriangray: yea
[2015-09-14 11:20:10] D3M0S: well, when I wrote my proxy, I had the proxy run all traffic back to the box running the tests, and stored the proxy server along with the test thread
[2015-09-14 11:20:11] duriangray: like if i am running this off a company server, would it be possible to ssh into our proxies via the server then run selenium
[2015-09-14 11:20:26] D3M0S: that way I didn't need authentication because the proxy server was thread safe
[2015-09-14 11:22:48] D3M0S: duriangray, he's an example of wiring up browsermob in ruby: http://elementalselenium.com/tips/66-blacklist
[2015-09-14 11:22:59] D3M0S: here's*
[2015-09-14 11:24:06] duriangray: ah so using that, i can block specific JS that slows down the page?
[2015-09-14 11:24:21] D3M0S: sec
[2015-09-14 11:24:34] D3M0S: http://elementalselenium.com/tips/64-limit-bandwidth
[2015-09-14 11:24:54] D3M0S: yes
[2015-09-14 11:25:16] D3M0S: but you don't need to use JS to do so
[2015-09-14 11:25:33] D3M0S: browsermob has a bandwith limiting feature that will slow down the page more realistically
[2015-09-14 11:25:52] duriangray: err i want to speed up the test by disabling specific JS on the page
[2015-09-14 11:26:19] D3M0S: oh, in that case, I'd actually just return a 400 instantly on the url loading the JS
[2015-09-14 11:26:39] D3M0S: so you request page, page requests js, page is slow
[2015-09-14 11:27:12] D3M0S: with browsermob: you request page, page is in proxy, proxy sees js request, proxy returns 400 instantly to page, page is fast
[2015-09-14 11:27:52] D3M0S: so in essence, you're "blacklisting" the js url
[2015-09-14 11:28:14] duriangray: ahh ok thanks! I will try it out
