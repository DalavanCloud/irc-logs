[2015-09-03 07:25:29] jimevans: D3M0S: in what language
[2015-09-03 07:25:30] jimevans: ?
[2015-09-03 07:25:59] D3M0S: Java, but I can wiggle my way through C# if it's using the same methodology
[2015-09-03 07:26:19] jimevans: unfortunately, they're not necessarily equivalent
[2015-09-03 07:26:30] D3M0S: yeah I didn't think they would be
[2015-09-03 07:26:43] jimevans: they may serve the same purpose, but the language runtime library treats them differently
[2015-09-03 07:26:56] D3M0S: well what I'm interested in is the purpose
[2015-09-03 07:28:00] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-03 07:28:38] D3M0S: I'm wondering what they're accomplishing?  Are they what makes the fields lazily initialized?
[2015-09-03 07:28:43] tiagoboldt, quitting. (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[2015-09-03 07:29:04] D3M0S: or are they already lazy by manner of using the PageFactory to set the fields?
[2015-09-03 07:29:47] jimevans: no, the page factory sets the member variable of your page object class to an object, so when you access it, you don't get an NPE.
[2015-09-03 07:30:20] jimevans: but it also makes the page object members lazy in that the elements they refer to don't have to be found until they're actually used.
[2015-09-03 07:30:38] tiagoboldt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-03 07:31:07] D3M0S: That's what I thought
[2015-09-03 07:32:26] D3M0S: so the Proxy is essentially just wrapping the member with a try catch to provide some additional try/catch checking on it?
[2015-09-03 07:32:31] auto_sam, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-03 07:32:43] jimevans: i wouldn't say that.
[2015-09-03 07:32:56] D3M0S: oh...
[2015-09-03 07:33:15] jimevans: essentially it's giving the member an interface implementation that will go find the actual WebElement on demand
[2015-09-03 07:33:42] jimevans: actually, will repeat the find every time the member is accessed
[2015-09-03 07:33:50] jimevans: (unless you cache the lookup with another annotation)
[2015-09-03 07:33:57] D3M0S: I see
[2015-09-03 07:34:51] D3M0S: So what method is accessing the implementation that actuallys finds the WebElement?
[2015-09-03 07:34:55] D3M0S: if that makes any sense
[2015-09-03 07:35:07] jimevans: that would be in the proxy.
[2015-09-03 07:35:18] jimevans: i don't have the code in front of me at the moment.
[2015-09-03 07:35:55] jimevans: but the proxy object allows you to intercept every method call on the interface, which is what allows the find to occur
[2015-09-03 07:35:58] D3M0S: because to me, I'm just calling MyPage.getMyElement and it's returning the element lazily...magic
[2015-09-03 07:35:59] D3M0S: new Class[]{WebElement.class, WrapsElement.class, Locatable.class}, handler);
[2015-09-03 07:36:27] D3M0S: So I'm assuming this is WrapsElement
[2015-09-03 07:36:58] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-03 07:38:17] D3M0S: but what and when is requesting getWrappedElement from that proxy?

[2015-09-03 07:44:45] D3M0S: So that InvocationHandler is the "how" to the "do this"
[2015-09-03 07:45:04] D3M0S: so whenever the proxy is accessed, the handler is invoked
[2015-09-03 07:45:08] D3M0S: in this case, locate the element

[2015-09-03 08:36:23] lukeis: the driver.manage().window()  API has the ability to get the location of the browser window…. keep in mind if you're then adding an element location to find the exact point in the screen, you may have to add in some for the BrowserChrome (you know, like toolbars and such)

[2015-09-03 08:40:18] dude-x: lukeis: i was thinking, it would be nice if we use simplejson for json decoding since it's a lot faster than pure python json
[2015-09-03 08:41:09] lukeis:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-09-03 08:41:25] lukeis: is that really where the bottleneck is? ;)
[2015-09-03 08:41:53] dude-x: not really
[2015-09-03 08:42:01] lukeis: and by 'a lot faster' are we talking a few milliseconds at most?
[2015-09-03 08:42:12] dude-x: i would have to timeit
[2015-09-03 08:43:07] lukeis: and then there's the whole, is it worth it to not use native python for our library and force all users to have this new dependency
[2015-09-03 08:43:11] dude-x: lukeis: there's one thing we can improve on though
[2015-09-03 08:43:21] lukeis: only one? ;)

[2015-09-03 09:34:38] cravecode: I haven't used selenium in 3ish years and things seemed to have changed a lot
[2015-09-03 09:35:14] jimevans: cravecode: which "selenium extension"? Selenium IDE? which "latest version"? the latest in the release channel, or in one of the pre-release channels (beta or developer)?
[2015-09-03 09:35:32] WhereIsMySpoon: cravecode: if you mean the ide, for a degree of "works", maybe
[2015-09-03 09:35:41] WhereIsMySpoon: cravecode: if you want stable, useful, reliable tests, use webdriver
[2015-09-03 09:35:43] cravecode: Selenium IDE for latest release of FF
[2015-09-03 09:36:14] tiagoboldt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-03 09:36:18] WhereIsMySpoon: if you want flaky, short-term, incomplete and moving forwards, unsupported tests, go ahead and use the IDE
[2015-09-03 09:36:43] WhereIsMySpoon: oh yea and good luck integrating the IDE into your CI env
[2015-09-03 09:36:50] cravecode: WhereIsMySpoon: thanks for your response. I seem to be getting confused by the different tools of Selenium.
[2015-09-03 09:37:05] cravecode: LOL WhereIsMySpoon that's exactly what i want to do!
[2015-09-03 09:37:23] jimevans: cravecode: no one who actively contributes to the project believes in the long-term viability of a record-playback paradigm for creating tests.
[2015-09-03 09:37:54] cravecode: I used to make test scripts by using the IDE extension for Firefox and record my browser usage.
[2015-09-03 09:38:09] cravecode: jimevans: that answers something i'm a bit confused by.
[2015-09-03 09:38:20] WhereIsMySpoon: cravecode: exactly what jim said
[2015-09-03 09:38:50] cravecode: jimevans: it seems like the "record" concept is downplayed now at i'm trying to read back over the docs. that was something i knew existed however the docs don't mention it
[2015-09-03 09:39:05] cravecode: WhereIsMySpoon++
[2015-09-03 09:39:09] cravecode: jimevans++
[2015-09-03 09:39:10] cravecode: thanks!
[2015-09-03 09:39:12] WhereIsMySpoon: cravecode: thats because it isnt reliable
[2015-09-03 09:39:26] WhereIsMySpoon: + all what we just said
[2015-09-03 09:39:31] bbarke, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-03 09:39:31] WhereIsMySpoon: its downplayed on purpose
[2015-09-03 09:39:41] jimevans: in my experience, tests created via a record-playback mechanism suffer from lack of maintainability, fast degradation and obsolescence due to target site changes, and lack of reliability due to transient issues that are better solved by actual code mechanisms.
[2015-09-03 09:39:52] jimevans: but that's just *my* experience.
[2015-09-03 09:40:11] Ardesco, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-03 09:40:15] jimevans: perhaps there's the platonic ideal of a record-playback tool that does not suffer from those weaknesses. i've yet to find it, if so.
[2015-09-03 09:40:48] cravecode: my old tests consisted of hitting a page, using xpath to verify things existed
[2015-09-03 09:40:49] titusfortner, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-03 09:41:02] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: I think these issues are seeable even without empirical evidence
[2015-09-03 09:41:07] jleyba: maintenance issues aside, record-and-playback tools rely on the fidelity of the "record" bit
[2015-09-03 09:41:30] jleyba: as the web evolves and apps/sites get more complex, recording is going to become more and more suspect
[2015-09-03 09:41:50] WhereIsMySpoon: cravecode: how do you trigger that? what if the page takes longer to load than normal? how do you generate custom logging/output?
[2015-09-03 09:42:13] cravecode: WhereIsMySpoon: that was exactly one of the issues that i ran into a lot
[2015-09-03 09:42:18] WhereIsMySpoon: what if the record mechanism records you clicking on a div when you actually want to click on a button, and the div changes?
[2015-09-03 09:42:25] WhereIsMySpoon: etc etc etc
[2015-09-03 09:42:33] WhereIsMySpoon: record -sucks-
[2015-09-03 09:42:42] cravecode: so i should be using something like the python language bindings and write my tests?
[2015-09-03 09:42:49] WhereIsMySpoon: whatever bindings you want
[2015-09-03 09:42:53] WhereIsMySpoon: python java ruby js
[2015-09-03 09:42:57] WhereIsMySpoon: uhh..
[2015-09-03 09:42:58] WhereIsMySpoon: and .net
[2015-09-03 09:43:03] WhereIsMySpoon: those are the official ones
[2015-09-03 09:43:03] cravecode: lol don't hate on C#

[2015-09-03 09:43:32] WhereIsMySpoon: there are about 10 and they all suck
[2015-09-03 09:44:01] sgsabbage: eh, the facebook php ones are the closest to a feature-complete set, I wouldn't say they suck
[2015-09-03 09:44:06] WhereIsMySpoon: i personally use the java bindings
[2015-09-03 09:44:13] sgsabbage: I have chosen my hill and I will defend it to the death ;)
[2015-09-03 09:44:29] WhereIsMySpoon: sgsabbage: then i will use the bigger claim that php sucks
[2015-09-03 09:44:30] WhereIsMySpoon: :P
[2015-09-03 09:44:55] WhereIsMySpoon: anyhow, troll hat off
[2015-09-03 09:44:57] sgsabbage: different claim, but yes. I mean, if someone has, for whatever reason, a requirement to use PHP, sure use the facebook ones
[2015-09-03 09:45:07] sgsabbage: but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend switching to PHP to use the bindings ;)
[2015-09-03 09:45:38] cravecode: my scenario: i'm attempting to setup a headless selenium server and i want to execute written tests in a CI. i'm guessing i need to install selenium server and use something like Xvfb. where does Webdriver fit in with that?
[2015-09-03 09:46:03] WhereIsMySpoon: cravecode: webdriver and selenium dont care whether you use xvfb or not
[2015-09-03 09:46:25] cravecode: maybe i should ask: what is webdriver?
[2015-09-03 09:46:27] WhereIsMySpoon: the only thing you need to make sure of is that you set up the xvfb env properly, and use xvfb-run to run the node process
[2015-09-03 09:46:31] WhereIsMySpoon: aha
[2015-09-03 09:46:32] cravecode: i've read the docs and i'm still confused
[2015-09-03 09:46:39] WhereIsMySpoon: cravecode: webdriver is selenium 2.0
[2015-09-03 09:46:45] sgsabbage: it's the protocol you use to talk to the selenium server
[2015-09-03 09:46:49] WhereIsMySpoon: its a rewrite of the original protocol
[2015-09-03 09:46:53] sgsabbage: ^
[2015-09-03 09:46:54] cravecode: ah okay
[2015-09-03 09:47:24] cravecode: it isn't some tool that tries to launch a browser and emulate clicking around? (i hope not)

[2015-09-03 09:48:06] WhereIsMySpoon: cravecode: selenium webdriver talks to the browser drivers, which themselves launch the browser and use a javascript engine to interact with it
[2015-09-03 09:48:13] jimevans: cravecode: why would that be bad? that's exactly what selenium rc was supposed to do.
[2015-09-03 09:48:20] WhereIsMySpoon: im not a selenium dev but thats roughly what goes on
[2015-09-03 09:48:50] WhereIsMySpoon: cravecode: in essence selenium tries to emulate a user
[2015-09-03 09:48:55] WhereIsMySpoon: except without the dumbness
[2015-09-03 09:48:56] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-09-03 09:48:57] cravecode: so webdriver controls firefox that is running in Xvfb?
[2015-09-03 09:49:15] WhereIsMySpoon: leave xvfb out of this
[2015-09-03 09:49:17] WhereIsMySpoon: it doesnt matter
[2015-09-03 09:49:23] jimevans: webdriver controls firefox. full stop. whether it's running in xvfb is beside th epoint
[2015-09-03 09:49:24] sgsabbage: I dunno WhereIsMySpoon, I've written some pretty dumb tests ;)
[2015-09-03 09:49:36] WhereIsMySpoon: it could be running in my banana window manager
[2015-09-03 09:49:42] cravecode: lol perfect
[2015-09-03 09:49:43] WhereIsMySpoon: or a toaster
[2015-09-03 09:49:54] cravecode: this is helping a lot. thanks
[2015-09-03 09:49:54] *sgsabbage -> home'
[2015-09-03 09:50:40] cravecode: so if webdriver controls firefox, what does selenium server do?
[2015-09-03 09:50:41] WhereIsMySpoon: cravecode: xvfb is just a tool to make the browsers able to be launched in a headless env
[2015-09-03 09:51:00] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium server intercepts the bindings and sends the commands to the browser drivers
[2015-09-03 09:51:08] lukeis: selenium server allows you to run "remotely"
[2015-09-03 09:51:16] WhereIsMySpoon: er
[2015-09-03 09:51:28] WhereIsMySpoon: i think that may be answers to 2 questions
[2015-09-03 09:51:33] jimevans: protip: if you're running everything locally on a single machine, you don't need to use the selenium server.
[2015-09-03 09:51:45] jimevans: you don't even need java at all
[2015-09-03 09:51:57] lukeis: (unless you're using php ;) )
[2015-09-03 09:51:58] cravecode: jimevans: thanks! it will be on the same machine
[2015-09-03 09:51:59] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: technically arent you using the server regardless of whether you're running a hub/node thing or just locally
[2015-09-03 09:52:14] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: not the selenium server, no.
[2015-09-03 09:52:18] WhereIsMySpoon: cause the bindings send http requests
[2015-09-03 09:52:30] jimevans: you can run, for example, the .NET bindings and never have java anywhere near your machine
[2015-09-03 09:52:33] lukeis: yes, but directly to the browser drivers
[2015-09-03 09:52:38] WhereIsMySpoon: ah sorry then
[2015-09-03 09:52:47] WhereIsMySpoon: see, told you im not a dev :p
[2015-09-03 09:52:52] jimevans: the browser drivers directly implement an http server that understands the remote end of the webdriver api
[2015-09-03 09:53:08] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: ahhh right, thanks
[2015-09-03 09:53:11] lukeis: selenium-server-standalone is mostly a proxy :)
[2015-09-03 09:53:16] WhereIsMySpoon: well I am a dev, just not a selenium dev
[2015-09-03 09:53:28] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: yea
[2015-09-03 09:53:41] cravecode: so webdriver controls the browser and selenium server would be used to control other webdrivers setup to receive tests?
[2015-09-03 09:53:48] jimevans: (where "browser drivers" == IEDriverServer, chromedriver, the project-provided webdriver.xpi for firefox, marionette's server component, and so on)
[2015-09-03 09:54:03] WhereIsMySpoon: webdriver controls the browser drivers
[2015-09-03 09:54:07] WhereIsMySpoon: the browser drivers control the browser
[2015-09-03 09:54:19] WhereIsMySpoon: the browser drivers are the middle man that "translate" the selenium commands
[2015-09-03 09:54:44] cravecode: good, i think i'm still following
[2015-09-03 09:55:17] cravecode: i'm now trying to fully understand the use of selenium server to rule it out or not in my situation
[2015-09-03 09:55:36] jimevans: cravecode:
[2015-09-03 09:55:37] jimevans: okya
[2015-09-03 09:55:47] WhereIsMySpoon: cravecode: will you need to start up nodes on multiple machines
[2015-09-03 09:55:48] jimevans: i can explain this, but it'll take a bit, so be patient
[2015-09-03 09:55:57] Ardesco: *sigh* Sombody mailed a full PDF version of Selenium Testing Tools Cookbook to the Selenium Users mailing list this morning.

[2015-09-03 09:56:06] cravecode: WhereIsMySpoon: no
[2015-09-03 09:56:08] WhereIsMySpoon: Ardesco: lol wtf

[2015-09-03 09:56:16] lukeis: ha
[2015-09-03 09:56:18] WhereIsMySpoon: Ardesco: someone doesnt understand email
[2015-09-03 09:56:29] WhereIsMySpoon: Ardesco: reach through the interwebs and pull those bytes back!
[2015-09-03 09:56:36] jimevans: the language bindings talk to the browser drivers via a protocol that uses json payloads over http requests.
[2015-09-03 09:56:51] *Ardesco reaches'
[2015-09-03 09:56:54] cravecode: jimevans: k
[2015-09-03 09:56:55] jimevans: that means that the browser drivers each have a small http server that understands the end points of the protocol
[2015-09-03 09:57:02] Ardesco: dammit I think i missed some…
[2015-09-03 09:57:14] GforOevOerD: lukeis Sorry I wasn't there. I want the Selenium to click on a point inside browser's window. Now, I need to have the offset of the point, but I don't know how to accomplish it.
[2015-09-03 09:57:21] WhereIsMySpoon: Ardesco: im missing 10 emails now..
[2015-09-03 09:57:25] WhereIsMySpoon: you got the wrong ones!
[2015-09-03 09:57:32] Ardesco: right food
[2015-09-03 09:57:37] Ardesco: ;)
[2015-09-03 09:57:38] jimevans: as i alluded to before, the browser drivers are things like IEDriverServer.exe (provided by the selenium project), chromedriver.exe (provided by the chromium project), and so on.
[2015-09-03 09:57:52] WhereIsMySpoon: GforOevOerD: is the point in an element?
[2015-09-03 09:58:20] jimevans: the browser drivers, in turn, control the browsers by whatever the most efficient and effective means are for that particular browser.
[2015-09-03 09:58:32] jimevans: now, here's the interesting bit.
[2015-09-03 09:58:48] cravecode: jimevans: ... i'm still following
[2015-09-03 09:58:50] fatguylaughing_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-03 09:58:54] GforOevOerD: WhereIsMySpoon Exactly
[2015-09-03 09:59:23] jimevans: since all the language bindings do is send out http requests to the drivers and listen for http responses, there's no requirement that the remote end of those http requests be on the same machine as the actual executing webdriver code.
[2015-09-03 09:59:38] jimevans: it *can* be, but it doesn't *have* to be.
[2015-09-03 09:59:40] WhereIsMySpoon: GforOevOerD: new Actions(driver).click(myWebElement)
[2015-09-03 09:59:48] WhereIsMySpoon: GforOevOerD: that will click in the middle of the given web element
[2015-09-03 10:00:09] GforOevOerD: WhereIsMySpoon No no, The problem is that Webdriver cannot find the element.
[2015-09-03 10:00:29] lukeis, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2015-09-03 10:00:30] GforOevOerD: WhereIsMySpoon That's why I want the Selenium to click on an offset
[2015-09-03 10:00:38] jimevans: what the selenium server does, is allow you to have a coordinating middleman that receives those http requests from the language bindings, then turn around an forward them to the browser driver on the machine where the selenium server is running.
[2015-09-03 10:00:52] WhereIsMySpoon: GforOevOerD: if you want to move to middle of element then go to offset and click, new Actions(driver).moveToElement(myWebElement).moveByOffset(x, y).click().perform()
[2015-09-03 10:00:58] jimevans: so you can have your webdriver code running on one machine, automating a browser running on an entirely different computer.
[2015-09-03 10:01:00] WhereIsMySpoon: GforOevOerD: i forgot the perform on the end of the last one
[2015-09-03 10:01:09] cravecode: jimevans: ah
[2015-09-03 10:01:13] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-09-03 10:01:18] jimevans: handy, if your normal operating environment is, say, linux, and you need to automate internet explorer
[2015-09-03 10:01:50] cravecode: jimevans: understood
[2015-09-03 10:01:59] cravecode: jimevans: thanks for taking the time
[2015-09-03 10:02:10] jimevans: but unless you're using that specific configuration, of executing the code on one machine, driving a browser on a different machine, you don't need to worry about the java selenium server when it comes to webdriver
[2015-09-03 10:03:22] cravecode: you all have helped a lot!
[2015-09-03 10:03:41] WhereIsMySpoon: we're happy to help if people are happy to listen
[2015-09-03 10:04:16] WhereIsMySpoon: but home time now for me, bb and have fun

[2015-09-03 10:28:13] jimevans: because that's what the edge driver expects.
[2015-09-03 10:28:23] titusfortner: ok. :)

[2015-09-03 10:37:19] jimevans: the problem is interop with the java remote server, i think
[2015-09-03 10:37:31] jimevans: but i honestly don't know
[2015-09-03 10:38:02] jimevans: i also care rather less than i probably ought to.
[2015-09-03 10:38:11] titusfortner: hmmm, interesting. yeah, I think our java remote server tests only use Firefox

[2015-09-03 10:55:18] jimevans: voodoofish430: no, ToString is not what you want.

[2015-09-03 10:55:50] jimevans: ToString does *not* give the text of an element. .Text does, if the element has a text node (inner text).
[2015-09-03 10:55:50] voodoofish430: unless I use a lambda but even then it didn't work...
[2015-09-03 10:56:26] jimevans: if the text is provided by an attribute (like for an <input> element, whose text is provided via a "value" attribute), you'd use "GetAttribute"
[2015-09-03 10:56:57] jimevans: but it might be better if you provided actual code that shows what's not working. use :gist or similar

[2015-09-03 12:30:51] *AutomatedTester can live with that currently'
[2015-09-03 12:31:28] barancev: 1) some operations are not implemented, like switchTo().parentFrame() or driver.close()

[2015-09-03 12:33:58] AutomatedTester: 4) the endpoint is not implemented in Wires because the spec needs updating
[2015-09-03 12:34:11] barancev: aha, wires, ok
[2015-09-03 12:34:23] AutomatedTester: 1) I need to look at
[2015-09-03 12:34:26] barancev: 2) yes, I see the standard. but the question is: how to simulate this? many tests switch to window by name
[2015-09-03 12:34:45] barancev: executeJavascript?
[2015-09-03 12:34:55] jimevans: the tests are obsolete.
[2015-09-03 12:35:00] jimevans: but yeah
[2015-09-03 12:35:18] jimevans: you'd need to switch to the windows, get window.name via javascript, and compare

[2015-09-03 14:34:32] AutomatedTester: how we decide native events support
[2015-09-03 14:34:45] AnConio: if pageA has a method that takes me to pageB...so the return type of methodA is pageB...and pageB has a method in there, methodB

[2015-09-03 14:35:51] AnConio: why can't I do some chaining...pageA.methodA().methodB successfully....the webelements in methodB aren't being found
[2015-09-03 14:35:53] barancev: if we follow this strategy it would simpify firefoxdriver support drastically

[2015-09-03 14:36:27] barancev: only in regard to native events iirc
[2015-09-03 14:36:57] AnConio: it's as if pageB isn't being instantiated...and thus it's members/fields aren't being found or instantiated

[2015-09-03 14:41:39] dude-x: AnConio: if PageA methods object that are PageB, then Page A needs to import import Page B and instantiate it somehow, or Page B needs static methods

[2015-09-03 14:44:08] AnConio: ah, okay...why do you not like 'em? aside from "debuggability"?

[2015-09-03 14:45:08] AnConio: right, you get an error in a line that does 8 different things so it's hard to figure out which method is the one that effed up?
[2015-09-03 14:45:16] AutomatedTester: yes
[2015-09-03 14:45:27] AutomatedTester: and then... to debug... you split it out
[2015-09-03 14:45:38] AnConio: unless you have exception handling in all of your methods?
[2015-09-03 14:45:58] AutomatedTester: and what would that exception handling do
[2015-09-03 14:46:00] dude-x: AnConio: another issue too is "wiring up" the classes of page objects

[2015-09-03 14:47:31] dude-x: yes.
[2015-09-03 14:48:01] AnConio: ah, hence the pageA methods have to instantiate pageB objects...that's what you mean by "wiring up"

[2015-09-03 14:49:04] dude-x: yeah

[2015-09-03 14:50:05] AnConio: and I have to admit, the idea of method chaining does sound "appealing"
[2015-09-03 14:50:09] AnConio: "sexy" if you will
[2015-09-03 14:50:35] dude-x: when i used to write tests in Java, my predecessors wrote some fancy code to initialize the wrapper to webdriver;
[2015-09-03 14:50:53] dude-x: it was kind of cool, less boilerplate to use page objects in my tests
[2015-09-03 14:51:28] dude-x: i just import the page objects i use in the tests, and i didn't need to initialize them.
[2015-09-03 14:51:56] titusfortner: I used to do the chaining. It was definitely more trouble than it was worth, and it often made the long chains confusing
[2015-09-03 14:52:05] titusfortner: just because you can do it all on one line doesn't mean you should. :)
[2015-09-03 14:52:21] dude-x: but if wanted to know how that stuff worked or how to add more auto-"wired" stuff, i had to had understand 3 layers of complicated code
[2015-09-03 14:53:11] AnConio: agreed guys...but I'm sure there's an "etiquette" limit to method chaining...I would think
[2015-09-03 14:53:50] AnConio: like I said, chaining 2 or 3 methods seems nice....chaining 8 or 12 methods that take you to 5 or 6 pages seems iffy

[2015-09-03 15:01:19] dude-x: I would recommend not using fluent interfaces.
[2015-09-03 15:01:26] dude-x: say you have a login page
[2015-09-03 15:02:00] dude-x: you would have a method to typeUsername, typePassword, clickSubmit() ; these are functions that do one thing well

[2015-09-03 15:02:57] dude-x: the advantage to having simple functions is that you can do have tests that types the username, then click submit, or skip typing the username and type the passowrd, then the username
[2015-09-03 15:03:07] dude-x: you can do things in different orders
[2015-09-03 15:03:14] dude-x: that's all good and dandy
[2015-09-03 15:03:32] dude-x: but for future tests, you don't want to log in via atomic steps

[2015-09-03 15:05:15] potatoes_: so I'm trying to run a simple test with selenium to take it out for a ride.. it keeps complaining about not being able to find my browser, chrome, firefox or otherwise and mentions setting the path.. well I have set the path and it's still not finding it, i'm stumped.
[2015-09-03 15:05:36] dude-x: potatoes_: what OS, what language?
[2015-09-03 15:07:37] potatoes_: pardon me :) MacOSX and Ruby
[2015-09-03 15:07:56] dude-x: AnConio: so that basic structure to a page object can get you pretty far, and it's maintainable, and it won't make your coworkers upset
[2015-09-03 15:07:56] dude-x: but say you have a webapp that has many common components, like say a floating window that helps you do stuff.
[2015-09-03 15:08:19] dude-x: instead of page objects where they interact with elements; you can have page objects that represent these shared components
[2015-09-03 15:08:45] dude-x: you may have a button class that takes a locator, and it has methods that can just click.

[2015-09-03 15:14:50] dude-x: AnConio: the hardest challenge is reducing boilerplate; but even then as long you follow this basic pattern
[2015-09-03 15:14:58] dude-x: you will have tests that are easy to write and maintain.
[2015-09-03 15:15:30] dude-x: page objects should only return text, booleans, or nothing, they execute an action
[2015-09-03 15:15:53] dude-x: all the hard logic should go in the page object itself, like selecting a row from a list
[2015-09-03 15:20:08] AnConio: I understand all of that dude-x
[2015-09-03 15:20:28] AnConio: and I do appreciate you taking the time
[2015-09-03 15:20:36] dude-x: one thing i am thinking about is more advance stuff
[2015-09-03 15:20:44] dude-x: like proxying the calls to find element
[2015-09-03 15:21:18] dude-x: so i can say that login = find(By.Id, 'login_button')
[2015-09-03 15:22:02] dude-x: and i just say login.send_keys('hello');
[2015-09-03 15:22:25] dude-x: another advance thing i've seen but trying to figure out to incorporate is an "Action bot" style
[2015-09-03 15:22:49] dude-x: click(login_button) type(username_field, "me@example.com")
