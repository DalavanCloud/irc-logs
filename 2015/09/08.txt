[2015-09-08 03:57:03] pal: What is a Slenium IDE and Selenium Standalone Server?
[2015-09-08 03:58:04] pal: I'm new to testing. I searched a lot on google about IDE, but the results arenot satisfactory.
[2015-09-08 03:58:23] pal: Anybody here to help me out?
[2015-09-08 03:59:27] WhereIsMySpoon: pal: the IDE is an addon to firefox that does record-playback scripts. It is currently running on old, outdated and unsupported tech and is not updated anymore. Additionally, the tests it creates are not very reliable
[2015-09-08 03:59:45] WhereIsMySpoon: pal: the successor to the IDE is code-based selenium, which is now in version 2.0, called WebDriver
[2015-09-08 04:00:42] pal: okay. So how do I proceed?
[2015-09-08 04:00:53] WhereIsMySpoon: pal: selenium standalone server is a more advanced piece of tech to help support the code-based testing by allowing a hub-node relationship, where you run the tests on your "hub" machine (which you create by running the standalone server in -hub mode) and then connect "nodes" (by running the standalone server in -node mode) so that you can parallel

[2015-09-08 04:34:30] MCMic: WhereIsMySpoon: using javascript attributes are in the original order but & are still escaped
[2015-09-08 04:35:23] barancev: simonstewart: because we expect that 2 sec is enough to process all requests
[2015-09-08 04:35:49] simonstewart: Well, that's just rubbish
[2015-09-08 04:35:55] barancev: of course :)
[2015-09-08 04:35:56] WhereIsMySpoon: MCMic: then convert them
[2015-09-08 04:36:06] simonstewart: How does that verify that we've defaulted to FIFO order?
[2015-09-08 04:36:06] barancev: this test smells
[2015-09-08 04:36:12] MCMic: ><
[2015-09-08 04:36:49] MCMic: My point is to know if they are escaped in the original HTML, because they should. Using javascript I get parsed HTML and I canâ€™t distinguish both
[2015-09-08 04:37:03] simonstewart: barancev: that test is super-flaky for me
[2015-09-08 04:37:20] MCMic: Itâ€™s so stupid I canâ€™t just get the HTML code of the page Iâ€™m on

[2015-09-08 04:39:07] barancev: simonstewart: the failed case means that 2 sec was not enough, and there were unprocessed requests
[2015-09-08 04:39:24] simonstewart: The latter appears to be the more important one
[2015-09-08 04:39:41] barancev: but it was *supposed* that 2 sec is enough :)

[2015-09-08 13:36:05] truthseeker1990: Hey, I was wondering do you actually need to have the browser installed on the computer in order to use selenium?
[2015-09-08 13:36:48] truthseeker1990: I am trying to write a python script to automate accessing a webpage using selenium. The script is going to be hosted on a small free service but I will not have any installation of the actual browser available
[2015-09-08 13:37:55] dude-x: truthseeker1990: with java you use HTMLunit
[2015-09-08 13:38:02] titusfortner: you can use phantomjs as the driver, but it's a virtual browser, not a real browser so results may vary
[2015-09-08 13:38:15] truthseeker1990: I was using the python binding, WebDriver
[2015-09-08 13:38:48] truthseeker1990: I was not sure whether selenium simply simulated the broswer of relied on the actual browser
[2015-09-08 13:39:42] smccarthy: truthseeker1990: you can have the browser open on a remote machine (using selenium grid or selenium server)
[2015-09-08 13:40:15] truthseeker1990: ok, thanks smccarthy, but you definitely need access to a browser...appreciate it.

[2015-09-08 17:52:07] felixn: http://splash.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ <-- anyone ever use this for testing? It's really fast compared to phantomjs, ~51 rps on my machine @ 50 concurrency.  phantomjs ~2 rps @ 25 concurrency and makes my machine want to barf.  I could see it being useful for locally testing before shipping off to the CI
