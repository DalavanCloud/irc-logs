[2015-03-18 07:09:07] WhereIsMySpoon: Dirkos: findelement doesnt guarantee that the element is clickable, and that is a very weird way of going about doing a webdriverwait then click
[2015-03-18 07:09:45] WhereIsMySpoon: hm, seems like its from the doc though
[2015-03-18 07:10:22] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont do csharp, but you would need to use expectedconditions to make sure that the element is clickable Dirkos

[2015-03-18 07:18:23] WhereIsMySpoon: literally ExpectedConditions has a clickable element option

[2015-03-18 07:19:31] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont think advocating a custom solution is going to be better
[2015-03-18 07:19:39] WhereIsMySpoon: when u can just plug and use expectedconditions

[2015-03-18 08:01:58] Alak: well, i wanted to retest if test case fail
[2015-03-18 08:02:11] Alak: im using loop to loop
[2015-03-18 08:02:13] WhereIsMySpoon: Alak: that is something quite different
[2015-03-18 08:02:22] sircapsalot: is there anything preventing you from going to supported language bindings?

[2015-03-18 08:04:43] Alak: jup
[2015-03-18 08:04:44] WhereIsMySpoon: it says it can do loops
[2015-03-18 08:04:46] WhereIsMySpoon: soo
[2015-03-18 08:04:54] WhereIsMySpoon: whats de problem
[2015-03-18 08:05:10] Alak: yeah but problem is more complex
[2015-03-18 08:05:37] Alak: when test going in loop and something unexpected happen
[2015-03-18 08:05:44] Alak: testcase fail
[2015-03-18 08:06:04] WhereIsMySpoon: Alak: then you want ot restart the test case
[2015-03-18 08:06:08] WhereIsMySpoon: not just go back a few steps
[2015-03-18 08:06:15] WhereIsMySpoon: thats how testing works everywhere
[2015-03-18 08:06:42] Alak: aye but i want to retest after fail
[2015-03-18 08:07:02] Alak: when im gone from pc ;)
[2015-03-18 08:07:06] WhereIsMySpoon: bleh
[2015-03-18 08:07:21] WhereIsMySpoon: you need to put ur tests in webdriver in code and use a proper test runner and scheduler
[2015-03-18 08:07:23] Alak: i know its possible with more complex soft
[2015-03-18 08:07:35] WhereIsMySpoon: ide is not meant for a test suite and full blown testing

[2015-03-18 08:08:15] sircapsalot: :mday
[2015-03-18 08:08:16] WhereIsMySpoon: time spent wondering is time you could spend learning to code
[2015-03-18 08:08:17] Alak: so wanted to check for sure:)
[2015-03-18 08:08:27] WhereIsMySpoon: ;)
[2015-03-18 08:08:48] WhereIsMySpoon: Alak: IDE is not really supported much or at all any more
[2015-03-18 08:08:58] Alak: im moving to webdriver in next month
[2015-03-18 08:09:03] sircapsalot: I hope this answers your question, and gets you thinking of alternatives
[2015-03-18 08:09:03] WhereIsMySpoon: great :)
[2015-03-18 08:09:15] Alak: but i wanted to know this last damn thing ;)
[2015-03-18 08:09:19] WhereIsMySpoon: ask lots of questions about webdriver here :)
[2015-03-18 08:09:24] WhereIsMySpoon: we can all help with that
[2015-03-18 08:09:39] WhereIsMySpoon: what language u thinking of using for webdriver?
[2015-03-18 08:09:42] Alak: ill be using web tutorials probably
[2015-03-18 08:09:49] Alak: probably java
[2015-03-18 08:09:54] sircapsalot: good choice
[2015-03-18 08:09:54] WhereIsMySpoon: oki
[2015-03-18 08:10:08] WhereIsMySpoon: mmhm, java, python, ruby and .net are all good bindings
[2015-03-18 08:10:20] WhereIsMySpoon: :apidocs
[2015-03-18 08:10:25] WhereIsMySpoon: and javascript

[2015-03-18 08:10:52] WhereIsMySpoon: i use java too
[2015-03-18 08:10:53] Alak: so learning java will help
[2015-03-18 08:10:53] sircapsalot: it'd make sense to keep to that then.
[2015-03-18 08:11:29] sircapsalot: right - then you aren't violating the principle of least astonishment http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment
[2015-03-18 08:11:38] Alak: i suspected that going to another test label is imposible

[2015-03-18 08:12:55] sircapsalot: yea alak, it's a common pitfall with software testing.  test dependency
[2015-03-18 08:13:07] WhereIsMySpoon: and im pretty sure if you explained the concept to your test manager he or she wouldnt be ither
[2015-03-18 08:13:08] sircapsalot: we've all been there
[2015-03-18 08:13:39] WhereIsMySpoon: sircapsalot: i have yet to create cross-test dependencies, mostly becauuse a) i design with that in mind and b) I use a test runner that scrambles the test order anyway so I cant :p
[2015-03-18 08:14:01] Alak: well, i cannot talk about much automation in work

[2015-03-18 08:14:31] WhereIsMySpoon: Alak: then I built our automation test framework and tests :)
[2015-03-18 08:14:42] WhereIsMySpoon: and im not even a QA person lol im a dev
[2015-03-18 08:14:46] sircapsalot: Alak, i was there too.  I was the one that started using Selenium here.
[2015-03-18 08:14:56] sircapsalot: WhereIsMySpoon me too!  Software Engineer in Test is where it's at ;)
[2015-03-18 08:14:58] WhereIsMySpoon: *highfive*
[2015-03-18 08:15:09] WhereIsMySpoon: nah, im a pure software dev
[2015-03-18 08:15:22] WhereIsMySpoon: i just do bits of other stuff too :p
[2015-03-18 08:15:30] sircapsalot: Alak do you have anybody bought into test automation where you are?
[2015-03-18 08:15:52] Alak: nah, I learned all by myself
[2015-03-18 08:16:10] Alak: first ide, then some if, loops
[2015-03-18 08:16:11] sircapsalot: I assume you are going to come up with a proof of concept then, and a ROI model for them
[2015-03-18 08:16:13] Alak: vars
[2015-03-18 08:16:26] Alak: then im using selfmade xml generator to import data
[2015-03-18 08:16:26] Alak: :P
[2015-03-18 08:16:46] Alak: quite fun
[2015-03-18 08:17:21] Alak: even done some load testing via 120 x selenium ide
[2015-03-18 08:17:26] Alak: fun fun fun
[2015-03-18 08:17:33] Alak: but yup, time to learn webdriver
[2015-03-18 08:17:48] WhereIsMySpoon: Alak: that isnt what he was asking
[2015-03-18 08:17:58] WhereIsMySpoon: he was asking if you have people who already want you to start doing better/more automation
[2015-03-18 08:17:59] sircapsalot: you guys notice that since we moved the selenium repo officially to Github, Selenium has gotten so many more stars
[2015-03-18 08:18:08] sircapsalot: it's consistently going up
[2015-03-18 08:18:19] WhereIsMySpoon: thats cause github rocks

[2015-03-18 08:27:50] Padawan: So, suppose i created a page object and have a couple tests testing it. How do i go from there to test automatically with Chrome and Firefox? Like,  My Base TestCAse now initialize a Firefox Driver only, i could change it fro Chrome, but how can i run both?
[2015-03-18 08:28:28] dimacus, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-03-18 08:29:06] Dave_B_: have some kind of mechanism where it chooses between the drivers based on e.g. an environment variable or something, then set up multiple runs where for one run it's one browser and the toher run it's the toher?

[2015-03-18 08:30:47] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: as I thought :)
[2015-03-18 08:31:03] Padawan: I see, so i should do a script where i call the test suite n times, so i must set the browser in the constructor
[2015-03-18 08:31:10] WhereIsMySpoon: some dude was asking about ensuring stuff was clickable
[2015-03-18 08:31:42] WhereIsMySpoon: and there's no EC for it
[2015-03-18 08:31:57] WhereIsMySpoon: but in c# lambdas are much easier to deal with so it makes sense that its less extensive than java
[2015-03-18 08:32:32] WhereIsMySpoon: plus i know you like to tighten up the api jim whenever you can :)
[2015-03-18 08:32:41] jimevans: exactly so. and C# programmers that don't know lambdas (or "anonymous methods" as they're officially called) will be left far, far behind
[2015-03-18 08:33:08] WhereIsMySpoon: mmhm
[2015-03-18 08:33:38] WhereIsMySpoon: hows you anyhow jim
[2015-03-18 08:34:11] jimevans: i'm alright.
[2015-03-18 08:34:22] WhereIsMySpoon: Padawan: wherever you're currently initialising your Firefox driver or Chrome driver, you should add a condition to check on some env variable that you should set earlier
[2015-03-18 08:34:44] merobertsjr, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-18 08:34:45] WhereIsMySpoon: i personally use gradle to start my tests and set any env variables that can get passed into it
[2015-03-18 08:35:00] Dave_B_: Padawan: I'm not writing code to call my tests multiple times, I've got a couple of Jenkins jobs and each of them sets an env variable before it starts. In my code I have a bit where it picks the right browser based on that env variable. The result is the tests do get run once per browser, but I'm not writing a script to do so or anything complicated.
[2015-03-18 08:35:05] Dave_B_: eh, that ^

[2015-03-18 09:00:59] lukeis: (write docs that is ;) )
[2015-03-18 09:01:00] simonstewart: You don't want jetty upgraded?
[2015-03-18 09:01:16] simonstewart: Then don't put fucking stupid things in the "how to do a git merge" doc :)
[2015-03-18 09:01:20] jimevans: !m simonstewart

[2015-03-18 09:41:04] jimevans: so in the java page factory implementation, is it true that there's an ElementLocatorFactory for each type of ElementLocator, and those are a 1:1 relationship?
[2015-03-18 09:41:34] jleyba: maybe
[2015-03-18 09:41:53] jimevans: in other words, each ElementLocatorFactory implementation only exists to create one and only one type of ElementLocator?\

[2015-03-18 09:43:18] sircapsalot: even then though.. it's a hog.  when I was building ./go clean release, it was taking upwards of 10 gigs of memory.
[2015-03-18 09:43:23] simonstewart: I'm bouncing it for the second time in 5 minutes
[2015-03-18 09:44:43] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: yes
[2015-03-18 09:44:46] jleyba: sircapsalot, I've just got my machine overloaded with work at the moment (doing a clean build)
[2015-03-18 09:45:09] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: AjaxElementLocatorFactory, DefaultElementLocatorFactory and ElementLocatorFactory
[2015-03-18 09:45:13] jimevans: well, that's… not as pretty as i'd like it to be.
[2015-03-18 09:46:17] WhereIsMySpoon: well, elementlocatorfactory is the interface
[2015-03-18 09:46:18] jimevans: thinking purely in terms of extension, where i want a custom ElementLocator. not only do i need to create the custom locator, but also an ElementLocatorFactory implementation solely devoted to creating that locator.
[2015-03-18 09:46:21] WhereIsMySpoon: so its just the other 2
[2015-03-18 09:46:52] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: the factory impl doesnt really have anything in it
[2015-03-18 09:47:02] jimevans: i realize that.
[2015-03-18 09:47:08] jimevans: that's kinda not the point.
[2015-03-18 09:47:18] jleyba: jimevans, the other option is reflection and placing constraints on locator c'tor signature
[2015-03-18 09:47:28] jimevans: it's overhead that i don't want to carry over into the .NET implementation if i don't have to.
[2015-03-18 09:47:30] jleyba: (or introducing dagger/guice to selenium... simonstewart shouldn't ind that)
[2015-03-18 09:47:36] jleyba: mind*
[2015-03-18 09:47:41] WhereIsMySpoon: jleyba: whats that?>
[2015-03-18 09:47:55] jimevans: jleyba: yeah, i've been traveling down the same road intellectually for the last 45 minutes, and don't want to go that way either.
[2015-03-18 09:48:52] jimevans: but i'm just making sure i understand the java implementation correctly. seems like i do.
[2015-03-18 09:49:25] jleyba: javadoc updates are always welcome :)

[2015-03-18 14:45:35] ato: Is it an RC specific feature or does it delegate to something in (I'm guessing) FirefoxProfile?

[2015-03-18 14:46:52] ato: Why do you have to fix that?
[2015-03-18 14:46:53] lukeis: we still have a few thousand RC tests
[2015-03-18 14:47:07] ato: I'm so sorry.
[2015-03-18 14:47:08] lukeis: cause I have to upgrade our infra to use FF36
[2015-03-18 14:47:34] ato: Depending on their complexity, it might be a better yield to convert the tests.
[2015-03-18 14:47:56] lukeis: that effort would take me no less than a year by myself.

[2015-03-18 14:48:31] lukeis: dude-x: ignores all css / images / javascript you mean :)
[2015-03-18 14:48:34] dude-x: yes
[2015-03-18 14:48:45] lukeis: yep, kind of the point why we don't have one
[2015-03-18 14:48:56] dude-x: what the hell did i just write? that's what i get for not looking
[2015-03-18 14:49:17] ato: I'd be quite excited if there was an API to access network resources from the debugger.
[2015-03-18 14:49:29] ato: Oh wait there is.  It's called the remote debugger protocol.
[2015-03-18 14:49:35] lukeis: heh
[2015-03-18 14:49:41] ato: The thing just smells of incompetence.
[2015-03-18 14:50:32] dude-x: some webapps will return 200 and have nicely formatted "Error could not load resource X"
[2015-03-18 14:51:05] dude-x: for so called API testing, some people have API's that return 200 and a nice json blob that says error
[2015-03-18 14:52:20] bbark123, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-18 14:52:43] ato: There might be a future for a services protocol into browsers that devtools, debuggers, and WebDriver could share.
[2015-03-18 14:53:02] ato: So that you could load in services you'd need on a on-demand basis.

[2015-03-18 14:54:20] ato: Not totally unlike something I've worked on before: http://operasoftware.github.io/scope-interface/
[2015-03-18 14:54:56] miamitreeohfive: looking to automate some QA testing, for alignment issues and such, do i just take screenshots every step/page and then look at them all at a later date? what sthe best way of reviewing the tests that doesn't get "errors" ?
[2015-03-18 14:57:29] lukeis: you can make assertions / inspect your page throughout your test. Looking at screenshots later sounds error prone :)
[2015-03-18 14:57:45] ato: miamitreeohfive: For visual testing I'd recommend Applitools Eyes.
[2015-03-18 14:57:50] lukeis: yes, that too
[2015-03-18 14:57:52] ato: miamitreeohfive: It's based on Selenium.
[2015-03-18 14:58:01] lukeis: we're using it, quite a nice product
[2015-03-18 14:58:40] ato: Selenium can do what you ask, but you're eventually going to have to create so much infrastructure around visual testing that it's better to outsource the problem if you don't have a team of a few people to work on it full time.
[2015-03-18 14:59:11] ato: It's not a trivial problem to solve.
[2015-03-18 14:59:13] miamitreeohfive: so whats the main difference between using saucelabs/browserstack/testing bot and me installing selenium, is it just that they take care of setting up selinium witn apple/android support and i can run the tests remotely?
[2015-03-18 14:59:47] lukeis: it's taking care of VM management and video recording for you, not as easy as one may think
[2015-03-18 15:00:35] miamitreeohfive: yah huh? maybe i signup to one of those services so i can focus on writing the scripts to test.
[2015-03-18 15:00:39] ato: Where I work we have an entire department to deal with VM allocation and test environments.
[2015-03-18 15:00:53] lukeis: you're asking for a comparison between the 3??

[2015-03-18 15:30:17] lukeis: nope :)
[2015-03-18 15:30:19] lukeis: keep asking
[2015-03-18 15:30:29] ato: I want to build some more automation around our PRs.
[2015-03-18 15:30:48] ato: Things like auto-triggering compiles on CI.
[2015-03-18 15:31:17] lukeis: that would be awesome :)
[2015-03-18 15:32:02] ato: Servo has a bot that does this against buildbot.
[2015-03-18 15:32:09] ato: So I was thinking I could steal some of that source code.

[2015-03-18 15:55:41] lukeis: Selenium RC is so shitty that it has tests that fail and the test runner says the tests pass  (this is in the Selenium code base…)

[2015-03-18 15:57:44] lukeis: fails….  "All tests passed"
[2015-03-18 15:57:59] lukeis: smh

[2015-03-18 15:59:10] lukeis: the thread running has an exception and terminates… Success!!
[2015-03-18 15:59:36] lukeis: what a crappy test.
[2015-03-18 16:00:01] ato: How does that even work wrt. scoping?
[2015-03-18 16:00:11] lukeis: it doesn't
[2015-03-18 16:00:45] ato: It looks like it's just creating 20 threads and the GC tears them down again because they go out of scope.
[2015-03-18 16:01:15] ato: On it passes in the "run" routine.
[2015-03-18 16:01:38] ato: What is this actually testing?

[2015-03-18 16:09:04] ato: What's that?
[2015-03-18 16:09:21] lukeis: destroying the tests that use the particular method that is failing
[2015-03-18 16:09:35] ato: I approve of this.
