[2015-03-10 07:47:17] asda: ok, new issue opened at:  https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=8593
[2015-03-10 07:48:25] jleyba_: asda: fyi Firefox is wonky with focus when it is not the active application
[2015-03-10 07:49:04] asda: right, which is why we run only one firefox per agent so it is always the active application
[2015-03-10 07:49:50] jleyba_: If you’re running on Linux, you can try setting FirefoxProfile.setAlwaysLoadNoFocusLib(true)
[2015-03-10 07:49:51] jleyba_: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/firefox/FirefoxProfile.html#setAlwaysLoadNoFocusLib(boolean)
[2015-03-10 07:50:47] jleyba_: (this won’t address the port issue, just helps with focus when FF isn’t active)
[2015-03-10 07:51:04] asda: nice
[2015-03-10 07:51:15] asda: so it could potentially allow us to run multiple firefoxes per agent?
[2015-03-10 07:51:23] jleyba_: yes
[2015-03-10 07:51:30] jkrocil, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-10 07:51:57] asda: cool,... those firefox agents will all try on the same port too though
[2015-03-10 07:52:09] asda: even if we partition the port between agents
[2015-03-10 07:52:21] asda: the multiple firefoxes will try on their particular port
[2015-03-10 07:53:51] asda: i didn't see a timeout that i could specify for waiting longer for that port either

[2015-03-10 11:22:16] lukeis: jimevans: the last statement in that bug report "Selenium server should always return "WEBVIEW" context."  is incorrect
[2015-03-10 11:22:26] jimevans: i concur on that.

[2015-03-10 11:24:00] jimevans: but my point was that the internal constructs of the .net bindings they need are useful enough to make them public. all someone needed to do is ask. but rather than ask, they built a solution that relies on reflection and non-public members.
[2015-03-10 11:24:24] lukeis: they did that with all the language bindings

[2015-03-10 11:48:09] jimevans: perf and complexity.
[2015-03-10 11:48:19] jimevans: not all browsers support xpath natively.
[2015-03-10 11:48:49] daemon: My browser has XPath, but I am assuming from your reply that I would get much better return times if I used css for instance
[2015-03-10 11:50:17] admc, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-03-10 11:50:41] jimevans: daemon: i can confirm nor deny the veracity of claims about performance. however, note that while all modern browsers support CSS selectors natively, not all support xpath-over-html natively, and thus must fall back on a javascript implementation of an xpath engine. if you're comfortable with the potential perf it of moving into and out of the javascript context for that, it's your choice.
[2015-03-10 11:51:10] daemon: jimevans, locked test environment, the only browser it can ever be is firefox
[2015-03-10 11:51:31] jimevans: but for cross-browser compatibility, i'd use something all browsers i'm interested in support natively.
[2015-03-10 11:51:46] jimevans: if you don't care about cross-browser compatibility, do whatever you want
[2015-03-10 11:52:17] daemon: excellent, thank you for helping me clear that up; I read it a few days ago and kinda lodged it in a queue in my subconscious to follow up on later :)

[2015-03-10 12:58:52] jimevans: okay. the issue is that the .NET bindings deserialize the JSON response into a .NET class, with attributes, and Json.NET does type-parsing, so strong-typing is a problem.

[2015-03-10 13:51:47] AutomatedTester: lukeis: why will it be a bitch to upgrade?
[2015-03-10 13:51:56] lukeis: oh, cause we suck here
[2015-03-10 13:52:10] lukeis: and a simple selenium upgrade (which i'm doing now) is a royal PITA
[2015-03-10 13:52:19] AutomatedTester: I am interested in what pain points there are
[2015-03-10 13:52:23] lukeis: java
[2015-03-10 13:52:38] AutomatedTester: well... you made your bed
[2015-03-10 13:52:42] AutomatedTester: :D
[2015-03-10 13:52:47] lukeis: and we liked to customize the guts of Selenium's internal classes ;)
[2015-03-10 13:52:55] lukeis: using reflection...
[2015-03-10 13:53:03] *lukeis has a huge whole in his foot'

[2015-03-10 13:54:01] AutomatedTester: barancev: really?
[2015-03-10 13:54:17] AutomatedTester: barancev:  is it because "java"
[2015-03-10 13:54:25] barancev: but aurora is ok
[2015-03-10 13:54:44] AutomatedTester: barancev: marionette is run on every push at Mozilla
[2015-03-10 13:54:55] AutomatedTester: so you're going to have to be more specific
[2015-03-10 13:54:56] jleyba_, joining. (#selenium)

[2015-03-10 13:59:24] daemon: in terms of performance when a GUI is not necessary, would phantom JS do as well as firefox
[2015-03-10 14:00:07] dude-x: daemon: some people feel you're only validating how the javascript performs under firefox, and not how it works under firefox (and other browsers perhaps)
[2015-03-10 14:00:19] dude-x: *under Phantom JS as opposed to Firefox
[2015-03-10 14:00:39] daemon: dude-x, I have an enviroment that is locked to whatever browser I choose, I chose firefox because the target platform is freebsd
[2015-03-10 14:00:54] lukeis: yvear: not really… here's the expected condition you could base it on :) https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/py/selenium/webdriver/support/expected_conditions.py#L179
[2015-03-10 14:00:55] dude-x: yvear: that may work
[2015-03-10 14:00:56] daemon: however XPath lookups are slow as hell (and css lookups unfortunatly will not work for these queries)
[2015-03-10 14:01:10] AutomatedTester: phantomjs doesnt have a modern JS VM last time I checked
[2015-03-10 14:01:15] daemon: so I could swap to phantom if it will provide a performance benefit
[2015-03-10 14:01:19] lukeis: that won't re-find the method
[2015-03-10 14:01:25] lukeis: yvear: ^
[2015-03-10 14:01:34] lukeis: s/method/element
[2015-03-10 14:02:05] lukeis: and element to be clickable takes a locator, not an element
[2015-03-10 14:02:45] bbark123: daemon: we use PhantomJs to increase performance - not really in execution speed but being able to run the tests in parallel. PhanotmJs is a lot lighter then Firefox, requiring about 50-80 mb per node, vs 500mb per firefox node
[2015-03-10 14:02:59] lukeis: yvear: oh but… you can combine those locators…. _by_css_selector(".classname tag")
[2015-03-10 14:03:43] lukeis: yvear: e = WebDriverWait(driver, 20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.css_selector, ".classname tag"))
[2015-03-10 14:03:55] daemon: bbark123, I have a very dynamic very JS heavy site, so I might give it a spin does it handle xpath queries natively?
[2015-03-10 14:04:32] dude-x: phantomJS is based on Webkit (i don't think it switched to blink)
[2015-03-10 14:04:42] jimevans: dude-x: is correct.
[2015-03-10 14:04:44] dude-x: so webkit should have native xpath
[2015-03-10 14:04:52] bbark123: haven't tried xpath, i avoid it like the plague. I usually use css to grab elements, then check if it is the right one instead of using xpath
[2015-03-10 14:05:06] daemon: perfect I will give it a spin in a VM of eq2ual specs to hte current implementation
[2015-03-10 14:05:09] AutomatedTester: it's an old webkit unless htey upgraded
[2015-03-10 14:05:11] daemon: and time them
[2015-03-10 14:05:21] dude-x: i only use xpath if i need to stuff like text() or go up and down the DOM tree
[2015-03-10 14:05:26] yvear: lukeis, locator is a tuple ('id, etc', 'string')?
[2015-03-10 14:05:36] lukeis: yes
[2015-03-10 14:05:42] dude-x: generic locator is (By.X, 'X')
[2015-03-10 14:05:50] daemon: dude-x, I have a tree that is dynamically created (ID and CLASS) w/ accompanying auto generated css document
[2015-03-10 14:05:56] dude-x: By.X is actually a string
[2015-03-10 14:06:04] daemon: that uses css classes for random elements as buffers and margins as such
[2015-03-10 14:06:05] daemon: for no reason
[2015-03-10 14:06:48] dude-x: i'd say with a modern browser, the penalty for using xpath may be neglible, so long the xpath is reasonable
[2015-03-10 14:06:56] yvear: lukeis, how can I combine locators?
[2015-03-10 14:07:10] daemon: dude-x, I am speccing the VM's with 4 cores totally 12.6Ghz and 2G of ram
[2015-03-10 14:07:25] jleyba_, quitting. (Quit: jleyba_)
[2015-03-10 14:07:32] lukeis: yvear: the constructor of the wait could take the "first" element as a context
[2015-03-10 14:08:10] dude-x: daemon: xpath is only a problem when using old versions of IE (7,8,9?(

[2015-03-10 14:08:44] lukeis: yvear: so… to get fancy……   e = WebDriverWait(WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable(<first locator>), 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable(<second locator))
[2015-03-10 14:10:29] yvear: lukeis, ok thx. I'll make a function b/c that would be nasty 5 deep o.0
[2015-03-10 14:11:07] lukeis: yes, please don't put that code straight into your scripts… that's fugly :)
[2015-03-10 14:11:12] dude-x: lukeis: are you can chain it that way?
[2015-03-10 14:11:21] dude-x: are you sure..
[2015-03-10 14:11:25] lukeis: the "driver" is just a search context
[2015-03-10 14:11:39] dude-x: oh i see
[2015-03-10 14:12:16] lukeis: the expected conditions are merely calling "find(s)" on it, so most should work
[2015-03-10 14:12:23] dude-x: yeah i see
[2015-03-10 14:12:26] lukeis: except the alerts one and window ones
[2015-03-10 14:12:40] yvear: lukeis, dude-x, is what I'm doing uncommon or could that be a good feature to add?
[2015-03-10 14:13:03] lukeis: not sure i see anything needing to be added to the selenium library?
[2015-03-10 14:13:24] dude-x: i have a feeling you're doing it wrong :p
[2015-03-10 14:13:46] daemon: dude-x, Ah excellent I believed it was emulated through JS on several browsers
[2015-03-10 14:13:48] lukeis: chaining finds isn't very common...
[2015-03-10 14:14:53] dude-x: i might have this in my code e = d.find_element(By.ID, 'foo').find_element(By.XPATH, '//bar')
[2015-03-10 14:15:33] lukeis: sh
[2015-03-10 14:15:37] lukeis: smh* :)

[2015-03-10 14:15:57] dude-x: this is pretty rare though, but it makes sense for the context of the thing i am working on  (usually something like table like data that is not well organized in HTML)
[2015-03-10 14:16:02] swypych, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-10 14:16:18] lukeis: can't make a single locator? :)
[2015-03-10 14:16:31] dude-x: well it's a bit more dynamic
[2015-03-10 14:16:40] dude-x: the first find is a row locator
[2015-03-10 14:16:42] lukeis: that i can understand ;)
[2015-03-10 14:17:04] lukeis: at that point you don't need an expected condition though to handle multiple locators
[2015-03-10 14:17:06] yvear: lukeis, dude-x, really it's rare? what if you need a tag deep in that doesn't have an id or name? wouldn't you have to work through the hierarchy?

[2015-03-10 14:17:40] lukeis: yvear: if you're after a particular element, you likely can do it in one locator
[2015-03-10 14:18:02] lukeis: even the most complex hierarchies can be searched with xpath
[2015-03-10 14:18:02] yvear: lukeis, how?
[2015-03-10 14:18:30] yvear: dude-x, can you give an example please?
[2015-03-10 14:18:39] dude-x: yvear: when all you have is divs and no other context like class or attributes then i use xpath
[2015-03-10 14:19:07] dude-x: but in that case, i start bugging the UI people to fix their code to be amenable to automation
[2015-03-10 14:19:26] merike, changing nick to merike|away.
[2015-03-10 14:19:26] dude-x: say you have a whole bunch of spans and they have different text
[2015-03-10 14:19:52] dude-x: you don't have a nice division of areas with divs or elements with sensible attributes
[2015-03-10 14:20:11] dude-x: then you can use xpath to do something like //div[@text="Blah"]
[2015-03-10 14:20:20] dude-x: err texxt()="Blah"
[2015-03-10 14:20:27] dude-x: *nevermind the typos
[2015-03-10 14:20:56] dude-x: this will narrow down the exact thing you're looking for
[2015-03-10 14:21:03] dude-x: assuming that you're lookning for things exactly
[2015-03-10 14:21:31] dude-x: and if it's generic, you can do partial matching of text with xpath
[2015-03-10 14:21:46] dude-x: contains(text(), "blah")
[2015-03-10 14:23:13] dude-x: the general strategy is can i use css selectors? No? then what xpath can i use? is the shape of the DOM far more varied, then what parent area can I trust to be stable, maybe i can chain off the parent element first and then look for the exact element i want
[2015-03-10 14:24:04] dude-x: if you're really determined you can write a single xpath that will locate whatever elements you want, but if your code is to be shared with a team, people will hate you

[2015-03-10 15:22:01] yvear: lukeis, how can I do it without making a separate func for each for enable checking? basically, how can I put the  '.find_element_by_class_name('classname').find_element_by_tag_name('tag')'  bit in the  'WebDriverWait(driver, 20).until(function)'  bit so I only need one function?
[2015-03-10 15:23:07] lukeis: not sure I would solve it by not having a separate function, or maybe even extending the expected conditions to allow you to create one with multiple locators passed in that it would chain the finds on
[2015-03-10 15:23:31] lukeis: lambda's are nice, for small concise things
[2015-03-10 15:23:41] lukeis: get them too elaborate and they become unreadable
[2015-03-10 15:25:14] lukeis: Balveda: add waits around your elements that are hitting the exception?

[2015-03-10 15:30:56] Balveda: The form I'm working with doesn't seem to be 100% reliable, which is why I'd need to see how to handle those without resetting the test
[2015-03-10 15:31:34] lukeis: one thing i've done (mainly for android, because selendroid is much more prone to hit a stale element condition) is add the StaleElementReferenceException to the list of ingored exceptions in the WebDriverWait and make sure every element is looked up with a wait and an expected condition that does something more than find (like check if it's visible or enabled)
