[2015-03-31 10:06:57] lukeis: :yt living on the edge
[2015-03-31 10:06:58] lukeis: !
[2015-03-31 10:07:50] jimevans: public service announcement: this in no way means a driver implementation for spartan is forthcoming.
[2015-03-31 10:08:08] ato: jimevans: You mean it's not done yet?
[2015-03-31 10:08:12] ato: jimevans: What kind of magician are you?
[2015-03-31 10:08:33] lukeis: i'm surprised it's not all done yet… jim is slacking
[2015-03-31 10:08:45] ato: lol
[2015-03-31 10:09:14] lukeis: I mean he hasn't launched Spartan yet… slacker!
[2015-03-31 10:09:22] jimevans: dammit!
[2015-03-31 10:09:39] ato: I keep getting confused by the name “Spartan”.
[2015-03-31 10:09:47] ato: It was also the name of Opera's old CI.
[2015-03-31 10:09:54] lukeis: Project Spartan
[2015-03-31 10:10:04] jimevans: Sparta was the internal code name for windows for workgroups
[2015-03-31 10:10:09] lukeis: we should now abbreviate it PoS
[2015-03-31 10:10:22] ato: Opera's CI, which I rewrote, is now named GOTH.
[2015-03-31 10:10:26] ato: Aptly named after a friend of mine.

[2015-03-31 10:12:34] *ato contemplates how hard it will be to change Marionette from using number codes for errors to strings'
[2015-03-31 10:13:06] jleyba: ato, use a map and call it a day
[2015-03-31 10:13:22] ato: jleyba: Marionette already uses strings internally, it's not that.
[2015-03-31 10:13:29] ato: jleyba: It's the risk management of the two client libs.
[2015-03-31 10:14:16] *jimevans beats the drum again about the status property of json responses having the same name in "status indicated by integer" and "status indicated by string" flavors of the protocol'
[2015-03-31 10:14:23] ato: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/marionette/error.js
[2015-03-31 10:15:01] lukeis: simonstewart: you ok with this? https://groups.google.com/d/msg/selenium-developers/tXjCeSFi-Sg/smMoTtM-MecJ    (i'm more so asking you about the proposal on using a team rather than the commit bit for him)
[2015-03-31 10:16:33] jimevans: i mean, i know that ship has sailed, but dammit i wish i didn't have to reconfigure the entirety of the json deserialization for .NET to handle the "this property could be a string, or it could be an integer" case
[2015-03-31 10:18:11] lukeis: selenium#8633 selenium#8634 selenium#8635 prove users refuse to read the issue template  ;) and I'm glad I changed the default status to invalid
[2015-03-31 10:18:17] jleyba: jimevans, aren't they separate keys? status == number, state == string?
[2015-03-31 10:18:32] jleyba: which is actually worse than status == number|string
[2015-03-31 10:18:35] jimevans: jleyba: nope, nope, and nope.
[2015-03-31 10:18:50] jimevans: it's status == number | string
[2015-03-31 10:19:10] jimevans: actually, it's only "status == string" in the w3c dialect of the protocol.
[2015-03-31 10:19:17] ato: jleyba: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#dfn-send-a-response

[2015-03-31 10:19:21] swampdragons, leaving. (#selenium)

[2015-03-31 10:19:48] jleyba: jimevans, and state == string in the oss dialect
[2015-03-31 10:19:50] jleyba: it's in the java code
[2015-03-31 10:19:55] ato: jimevans: Yeah, that can be a little confusing.
[2015-03-31 10:20:09] emperorcezar, quitting. (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[2015-03-31 10:20:24] jimevans: if i were using a language with no concept of static typing i wouldn't care.
[2015-03-31 10:21:21] jimevans: :log
[2015-03-31 10:23:16] ato: jimevans: You don't need to have a map that stores both eventualities internally.  You can store status as string internally and convert them on the way in, presumably?
[2015-03-31 10:23:22] jleyba: ato, wtf... (reading the link you posted)
[2015-03-31 10:23:30] ato: jleyba: ?
[2015-03-31 10:23:37] jleyba: the webdriver spec actually describes how to send a HTTP message?
[2015-03-31 10:23:48] ato: No.
[2015-03-31 10:24:03] ato: It leaves that bit intentionally hand-wavy.
[2015-03-31 10:24:12] ato: But it explains how to put together a response.
[2015-03-31 10:25:56] davehunt, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2015-03-31 10:26:00] jimevans: ato: from a language bindings' perspective, the mandate is to be able to talk to both 2.x style remote ends and w3c-compliant remote ends. thus i need to be able to deserialize each type of response at the local end. unfortunately the json.net library doesn't easily deserialize into .NET objects where a property value could be of differing types
[2015-03-31 10:26:01] emperorcezar, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-31 10:26:21] jimevans: or at least that's the mandate according to simonstewart.
[2015-03-31 10:27:08] jleyba: jimevans, can you define a common interface, try parsing as w3c-compliant impl
[2015-03-31 10:27:09] ato: jimevans: Sure, but you don't need a map that stores the status as an optional string _or_ integer and conditionals all over the place to know what you're dealing with.
[2015-03-31 10:27:12] jleyba: if that fails, reparse as 2.x impl
[2015-03-31 10:27:16] ato: Yes.
[2015-03-31 10:27:36] ato: Convert on input once you know what you're talking to or something.
[2015-03-31 10:27:46] ato: To some sane data structure of your choosing.
[2015-03-31 10:28:06] ato: Oh look, it's dawagner's birthday today.
[2015-03-31 10:28:09] ato: I better send him an email.
[2015-03-31 10:28:12] jimevans: ato: no i agree. i didn't mean i needed a map. that wasn't my suggestion.
[2015-03-31 10:28:48] ato: Oh okay, then I misunderstood.  I thought your grievance was finding types that worked for both protos.

[2015-03-31 10:33:42] simonstewart: jimevans, ato: that's the mandate
[2015-03-31 10:33:46] jimevans: ato: no my grief is with the deserialization library i'm using, which deserializes directly into .NET objects.
[2015-03-31 10:33:57] simonstewart: I need to settle down and code up a type sniffer
[2015-03-31 10:34:14] simonstewart: We should be able to tell from the first request and response what's available on both ends
[2015-03-31 10:34:42] simonstewart: (that is, by the end of the "newSession" handshake, the server knows whether the client is W3C or Selenium, and vice versa)
[2015-03-31 10:34:46] lukeis1:  /nick lukeis
[2015-03-31 10:34:50] lukeis1: oops :)
[2015-03-31 10:34:59] jimevans: which, because of the declarative nature of the library requires that the types be known ahead of time.
[2015-03-31 10:35:17] simonstewart: I don't think so
[2015-03-31 10:35:34] simonstewart: Oh
[2015-03-31 10:35:43] simonstewart: Once you know what the ends speak, life gets a lot simpler
[2015-03-31 10:35:44] jimevans: simonstewart: i wasn't responding to you. that was to ato, in continuation of my prior response.

[2015-03-31 13:43:08] jimevans: i think i submitted one along those lines at some point
[2015-03-31 13:44:29] AutomatedTester: jimevans: oh?

[2015-03-31 13:45:45] jimevans: it was a little different
[2015-03-31 13:46:01] jimevans: that the spec said "GET", then said "send a body"
[2015-03-31 13:46:09] AutomatedTester: oh... I can close that one
[2015-03-31 13:46:14] AutomatedTester: the spec today handles that

[2015-03-31 15:03:34] Garrick: I'm using selenium-webdriverjs. Updating from 2.44 to 2.45 has caused the browser.get to hang.
[2015-03-31 15:04:02] Garrick: I can see the selenium standalone server receive the command but I don't see the browser actually being driven.
[2015-03-31 15:04:04] Garrick: It just hangs.
[2015-03-31 15:04:22] Garrick: Any suggestions on debugging?
[2015-03-31 15:04:41] Garrick: I'm using chromedriver to drive embedded chromium.
[2015-03-31 15:04:45] Garrick: via debuggerPort.
[2015-03-31 15:13:32] jleyba: probably a variant of #363
