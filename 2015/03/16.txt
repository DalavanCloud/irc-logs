[2015-03-16 04:29:15] Dave_B_: desiredcaps or requiredcaps?
[2015-03-16 04:29:56] Fossi: ah, there is "RequiredCapabilities"?

[2015-03-16 05:07:56] Fossi: maybe the grid hub server is to old to understand those parameters?

[2015-03-16 08:50:48] WhereIsMySpoon: o.o
[2015-03-16 08:51:00] WhereIsMySpoon: gino4_0: why are you compiling your tests into a jar file?
[2015-03-16 08:51:28] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: g'day, was the explanation on your issue adequate?
[2015-03-16 08:53:09] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: yes
[2015-03-16 08:53:40] WhereIsMySpoon: thanks :)
[2015-03-16 08:54:47] gino4_0: WhereIsMySpoon: I've written them in java and compiling them to jar is the way I could get them to run
[2015-03-16 08:55:06] WhereIsMySpoon: gino4_0: most people use JUnit and run them as JUnit tests
[2015-03-16 08:55:10] WhereIsMySpoon: not compiling to jar

[2015-03-16 09:17:30] ato: You mean the locale of a specific browser?
[2015-03-16 09:17:37] similian: yes, sir - sorry
[2015-03-16 09:17:52] ato: I doubt there's a browser agnostic way to do that.
[2015-03-16 09:17:52] WhereIsMySpoon: that would be a profile/settings thing I think
[2015-03-16 09:17:56] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2015-03-16 09:18:08] ato: You'll likely have to create a custom profile for each browser and pass that in.
[2015-03-16 09:18:11] ato: Like WhereIsMySpoon said.
[2015-03-16 09:18:20] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: maybe on the node you coul dpass in something?
[2015-03-16 09:18:28] ato: Yeah.
[2015-03-16 09:18:29] WhereIsMySpoon: like you can specify some browser settings there
[2015-03-16 09:18:54] similian: pass it in where ? ( sorry i had to ask )
[2015-03-16 09:19:03] WhereIsMySpoon: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Command_Line_Options#Locale option here
[2015-03-16 09:19:07] WhereIsMySpoon: and as to how to pass it in...
[2015-03-16 09:19:21] similian: okay I see that - but my hub is just launched
[2015-03-16 09:19:36] similian: where can I tell the hub to pass something
[2015-03-16 09:19:42] similian: that would solve everything :D
[2015-03-16 09:20:08] WhereIsMySpoon: similian: you dont, you do this on the node
[2015-03-16 09:21:01] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: ive forgotten how to give browser arguments to the node on cmd line
[2015-03-16 09:21:06] WhereIsMySpoon: theres some format for it
[2015-03-16 09:21:19] similian: yeah i have been searching for that
[2015-03-16 09:21:24] WhereIsMySpoon: like you do --browser=firefox then some other stuff
[2015-03-16 09:22:14] WhereIsMySpoon: aha

[2015-03-16 09:22:19] WhereIsMySpoon: similian: ^
[2015-03-16 09:22:20] similian: i add that to the call when i start the selenium node ( or standalone server)
[2015-03-16 09:22:37] WhereIsMySpoon: oh it is the hub
[2015-03-16 09:22:38] WhereIsMySpoon: well w/e
[2015-03-16 09:22:44] WhereIsMySpoon: try that
[2015-03-16 09:22:55] ato: similian: You want to create a FirefoxProfile, set the Firefox preference related to locale on that, and pass that to the "firefox_profile" capability on your DesiredCapabilities object that you pass into RemoteWebDriver.
[2015-03-16 09:23:42] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: I think the profile way here is the same really
[2015-03-16 09:23:47] errant_rider: what is the correct browsername for IE?  capabilities.setCapability(CapabilityType.BROWSER_NAME, set_browser); i tried "internet explorer"…
[2015-03-16 09:23:55] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: Yeah, I just couldn't find a capability for setting args.
[2015-03-16 09:24:23] ato: errant_rider: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/BrowserType.java
[2015-03-16 09:24:58] WhereIsMySpoon: wait hang on similian, sorry i dont think this will be it
[2015-03-16 09:25:03] WhereIsMySpoon: similian: do what ato said
[2015-03-16 09:25:36] WhereIsMySpoon: i misread totally what my link was
[2015-03-16 09:25:52] similian: thanks for your help guys - i got stuck at the capabilities part before where I could not add any params - now I will try the profile thing

I have both the chromedriver and the standalone selenium server in a given directory, with the driver in my PATH. If I have a test file in the same directory, how do I *run* that test file? I think I may be overlooking something really simple.

[2015-03-16 11:08:26] ato: Ankit: Some may be faster than others.
[2015-03-16 11:08:54] Ankit: So, IE and firefox will behave slow only?
[2015-03-16 11:09:01] ato: The question is if one is substantially slower than another, in which case we might need to look at it.
[2015-03-16 11:09:10] ato: Also for what value of “slow”?

[2015-03-16 11:20:00] ato: barancev: Looking at the code right now, it looks like you're right.  We only support locating iframes by ID and index in content context.

[2015-03-16 11:44:43] ato: lukeis: I moved it to top-level because it seems to be generic to the whole project if you examine its content.
[2015-03-16 11:45:06] ato: It covers stuff from all directories, not just java/.
[2015-03-16 11:45:34] lukeis: it's supposed to cover java + standalone server

[2015-03-16 11:46:42] ato: lukeis: I quite like the idea of having a single, joint change log.
[2015-03-16 11:46:54] sircapsalot: that'd be a lot easier to maintain
[2015-03-16 11:47:13] ato: lukeis: But I see it covers a lot of Java + standalone server, but also atoms, Grid, third party, and JS.
[2015-03-16 11:47:36] ato: sircapsalot: I think the challenge is packaging.
[2015-03-16 11:48:09] sircapsalot: yea, if you bundle the python bindings, we really don't care about the java change log do we
[2015-03-16 11:48:24] ato: Right, exactly.

[2015-03-16 12:49:08] lukeis: in the test… you can certainly expose a PageObject.IsOnPage() method though

[2015-03-16 12:49:39] dude-x: Padawan: sounds like you're using a fluent model? either way the page object should figure that out; if you are writing tests you should know exactly where you are (unless testing something that has some ambiguity) or you're automating tasks,

[2015-03-16 14:07:54] ato: AutomatedTester: According to our tests it does.
[2015-03-16 14:08:10] AutomatedTester: that could because we use a different param name

[2015-03-16 14:09:49] AutomatedTester: yea
[2015-03-16 14:09:58] AutomatedTester: selenium uses id on
[2015-03-16 14:10:00] AutomatedTester: only*
[2015-03-16 14:10:08] AutomatedTester: wires hides this
[2015-03-16 14:10:43] ato: It's possible to switch to iframe by name, index, and element.  And ID is used for element?
[2015-03-16 14:10:48] ato: Just clarifying.
[2015-03-16 14:11:12] ato: s/ID/"id"// obviously
[2015-03-16 14:11:34] smccarthy: :note dimacus I think we should put out a new version of Selenium Grid Extras. There were a lot of bugs fixed in it, so we could close a lot of the open issues. Thoughts?
[2015-03-16 14:12:42] barancev: AutomatedTester: https://gist.github.com/barancev/86cd4f8aeb400bd4ceb4 -- is this trace invalid?
[2015-03-16 14:13:12] ato: barancev: Yes.
[2015-03-16 14:13:18] ato: barancev: It should be "element" instead of "id".
[2015-03-16 14:13:29] ato: barancev: Also it looks like you're using an old version of Marionette.
[2015-03-16 14:13:46] barancev: it the parameter name depends on the type
[2015-03-16 14:13:51] AutomatedTester: yea
[2015-03-16 14:14:06] AutomatedTester: barancev: it's always been that way
[2015-03-16 14:14:11] barancev: ato: it is nightly
[2015-03-16 14:14:13] AutomatedTester: not sure why, a legacy issue
[2015-03-16 14:14:58] ato: barancev: The sessionId should be a UUID if you use the latest nightly.
[2015-03-16 14:15:10] ato: barancev: There used to be a bug that we set the capabilities for sessionId.
[2015-03-16 14:15:48] barancev: nightly said it is the latest :)
[2015-03-16 14:16:09] ato: Look at the line that starts with "71".
[2015-03-16 14:16:29] ato: It returns UUID for sessionId, but not "608".
[2015-03-16 14:16:51] ato: Odd.
[2015-03-16 14:17:45] barancev: 71: and 608: -- it is size of the message
[2015-03-16 14:17:51] ato: barancev: Oh it looks like you're sending capabilities as sessionId.
[2015-03-16 14:18:07] barancev: yes
[2015-03-16 14:18:34] barancev: that was required in some marionette versions
[2015-03-16 14:18:37] ato: That's not necessary anymore (-:
[2015-03-16 14:18:37] barancev: fixed now?
[2015-03-16 14:18:41] barancev: cool
[2015-03-16 14:18:43] ato: Yup (-:
[2015-03-16 14:18:47] ato: Thanks to AutomatedTester.
[2015-03-16 14:21:06] ato: AutomatedTester: BTW we should say in the spec what should happen if you make a request against a remote with the wrong session ID.
[2015-03-16 14:21:15] ato: AutomatedTester: I don't think there's a check for that.
[2015-03-16 14:21:29] ato: Or maybe jgraham added one, I'm unsure.
[2015-03-16 14:21:42] AutomatedTester: ato: yea, its part of the new seession rewrite I have started
[2015-03-16 14:21:48] AutomatedTester: that and cookies
[2015-03-16 14:23:05] ato: So yeah, we need it in newSession too.
[2015-03-16 14:23:13] ato: But for every other request I mean.
[2015-03-16 14:23:41] AutomatedTester: ato: yea I am hoping that new session will give me framework for the normal commands
[2015-03-16 14:23:44] ato: AutomatedTester: Nevermind me, it's covered.
[2015-03-16 14:24:01] ato: “If command is not new session […] If session id is not equal to the id of any session in the list of active sessions, send an error with error code invalid session id, then jump to step 1 in this overall algorithm.”

[2015-03-16 14:34:59] ato: nirvdrum: #339
[2015-03-16 14:35:09] ato: nirvdrum: I think passing in milliseconds makes sense?
[2015-03-16 14:36:19] nirvdrum: ato: I'll need to review.  Some of this carried over from grid1.  I think krosenvold normalized everything internally to milliseconds even if the publicly exposed option was seconds.
[2015-03-16 14:36:42] nirvdrum: Unfortunately, just changing the unit means a bunch of people are going to have a bad day upon upgrade.
[2015-03-16 14:37:02] ato: Since the division internally seems to be towards seconds, I was thinking passing in seconds would be backwards compatible.
[2015-03-16 14:37:31] ato: But conceptually it sounds like using milliseconds internally and seconds for the UI is nicer.
[2015-03-16 14:37:48] nirvdrum: Yeah.  I need to review to be certain.
[2015-03-16 14:37:54] nirvdrum: I'm just saying what the risk is.
[2015-03-16 14:38:06] ato: Would be good if we could get some big users of it to try out the change.
[2015-03-16 14:38:16] ato: I'm not sure who they are.
[2015-03-16 14:38:19] nirvdrum: Mozilla was one of the biggest.

[2015-03-16 14:48:45] ato: Looks like Mozilla is relying on it being in milliseconds.

[2015-03-16 14:52:44] ato: Seems the path of least resistance is to use milliseconds for the UI.
[2015-03-16 14:52:44] nirvdrum: Unless Google just removed the option.
[2015-03-16 14:52:58] nirvdrum: Yeah, I think so.  I think grid1 was seconds and someone carried that forward.

[2015-03-16 15:05:09] nirvdrum: I'll concede having it different for the CLI and the JSON is not ideal.
[2015-03-16 15:05:23] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: The world is a frustrating place.

[2015-03-16 15:06:57] ato: nirvdrum: If we accept seconds for CLI and convert that to ms internally I'd say this is a wontfix.
[2015-03-16 15:07:11] ato: If the documentation is unclear, we should clear that up.
[2015-03-16 15:07:12] nirvdrum: Before closing it, I'd like to give him a chance to reply.
[2015-03-16 15:08:30] ato: I think we should be more like astronomers.
[2015-03-16 15:08:45] ato: They have really great definitions.
[2015-03-16 15:08:48] ato: “The next loss was the length of a second, which astronomers had defined as ‘1/31,556,925.9747 of the tropical year in 1900,’”
[2015-03-16 15:09:04] ato: (From https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1967009 which is a great read.)
[2015-03-16 15:10:11] nirvdrum: The problem with issues like this and we have some really shitty docs / usability and we have users that don't know what they're doing.  So it's always a case of trying to figure out who's at fault (hint: usually both) and making it so the user is never at fault.
[2015-03-16 15:10:44] ato: The docs are easy to change.
[2015-03-16 15:10:51] ato: Changing input and output moreso.
[2015-03-16 15:11:44] nirvdrum: Ooh.  JMX in grid would be nice.
[2015-03-16 15:11:54] nirvdrum: That's managed to slide to the very back of my TODO List.

[2015-03-16 15:39:26] barancev: AutomatedTester: ato: what about this trace -- https://gist.github.com/barancev/4e353f239eaf3b64d034
[2015-03-16 15:39:47] barancev: what's wrong this time?
[2015-03-16 15:40:26] barancev: should 'element' parameter be an element or an id of the element?
[2015-03-16 15:40:46] ato: barancev: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/marionette/marionette-listener.js?from=marionette-listener.js#1911
[2015-03-16 15:41:07] ato: I think it wants just the element UUID reference, not the object.
[2015-03-16 15:41:13] ato: Which is obviously a Marionette bug.
[2015-03-16 15:41:48] ato: Does it work if you extract ELEMENT's value and send that?
[2015-03-16 15:44:35] barancev: ato: yes
[2015-03-16 15:44:48] ato: Do you want to to raise a bug, or should I?

[2015-03-16 15:57:24] barancev: ato: is switchToParentFrame implemented?
[2015-03-16 15:57:56] AutomatedTester: barancev: don't think so
[2015-03-16 15:58:11] barancev: I can see the command in wires client -- https://github.com/jgraham/wires/blob/master/src/marionette.rs#L651

[2015-03-16 15:58:47] barancev: but "Marionette does not recognize the packet type \"switchToParentFrame\""
[2015-03-16 15:59:06] ato: I think switchToParentFrame is entirely missing from the Marionette server.
[2015-03-16 15:59:15] barancev: ok, np for now
[2015-03-16 15:59:33] ato: You can return to root I think, but not a frame's parent.
