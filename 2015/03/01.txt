[2015-03-01 05:02:03] shteou: c0mrade: That's pretty much it. If you're on 2.7.9 pip will be pre-installed. If not, you can install it using the easy_install script. Once you've got pip installed it should just be a case of pip install seleniu
[2015-03-01 05:03:19] shteou: I can't remember 100%, but you may also need to install chromedriver/iedriver to somewhere in your PATH. If you want to run selenium-server you need to install that yourself
