[2015-03-02 03:21:55] p0deje: does anyone know anything about performance decrease with firefox in 2.45.0?
[2015-03-02 03:22:22] p0deje: Iâ€™m from watir-webdriver team, and just noticed our specs have become much slower with firefox 30/31
[2015-03-02 03:22:57] p0deje: e.g. single test was running within 7 seconds, now - 50 seconds
[2015-03-02 03:23:23] p0deje: this happens with selenium-webdriver 2.45.0, but works fine 2.45.0.dev3

[2015-03-02 03:40:32] AutomatedTester: p0deje: but feel free to find the cause and fix, I know a lot of people would appreciate it

[2015-03-02 03:43:38] AutomatedTester: p0deje: we upgraded from a really old version so the regression range on httpd.js is quite large
[2015-03-02 03:44:19] p0deje: AutomatedTester: got it, Iâ€™ll try to find the problem
[2015-03-02 03:44:26] p0deje: AutomatedTester: thanks a lot

[2015-03-02 08:21:29] Padawan: dude-x: I already use a lot of python, but as i understand i cant port the conceptual part of the book for whatever language i want. What i look for is mainly, how to logically setup layers of abstraction to make it maintainable. I mean, at least my searches show me this is what i should stick to.
[2015-03-02 08:21:49] Padawan: But, i am open to what the community say, i know nothing yet
[2015-03-02 08:22:30] dude-x: well Python is a fine choice; if you know Page object model
[2015-03-02 08:22:31] Padawan: I watched a couple of selenium conference talks, and i am reading the selenium docs
[2015-03-02 08:22:37] dude-x: you have 1 key part
[2015-03-02 08:22:54] dude-x: if you know that in your page objects your methods should do "one" task well

[2015-03-02 08:23:12] Dave_B_: you should be able to port it to basically any language so long as the language the book is aiming at supports the same kinda object / inheritance patterns. Python works fine, and the page object model is a commonly used design pattern as dude-x observed
[2015-03-02 08:24:01] dude-x: Padawan: the second diffiuclt part is learning your test runner
[2015-03-02 08:24:14] dude-x: like how do you want to set up the browser, and tear it down
[2015-03-02 08:24:23] Padawan: dude-x: you mean the unittest runner?
[2015-03-02 08:24:24] Padawan: i see
[2015-03-02 08:24:31] dude-x: yeah
[2015-03-02 08:25:00] dude-x: so learning how to set up your test runner is another challenge; sure you can use page objects, but how are you going to set up the browser
[2015-03-02 08:25:14] dude-x: how are you going to run tests in parallel if you need to
[2015-03-02 08:25:22] dude-x: are you going to randomize your tests?

[2015-03-02 08:28:32] Accipiter: Hi Selenium team.  Thanks for the 2.45 release last week!  I wanted to ask about an issue I am seeing and whether it is the expected behavior or not.  It involves click actions.  We have been automating against Chrome with ChromeDriver for some time now and we have some pretty robust Page Models already.  When I attempt the same execution against FF35 I am seeing alot of clicks event fail to get processed.
[2015-03-02 08:29:42] Accipiter: With Chrome we are able to send the click event to a parent WebElement and the event is triggered, but I am having to re-write alot of Page Models now to click the element that actually has the clickEvent attached to it in order for Automation to work in FF35.

[2015-03-02 08:31:23] Padawan: I'm a complete newbie. My plan was to get some link to some deep understanding upon page objects first. I have been reading a lot about it, but each post i find is somewhat different. What i did got from it all is that i should split my application in page classes and there should be user interaction methods related to each page, mainly following the money path or the business value.
[2015-03-02 08:32:32] seljenkinsbot: Yippee, build fixed!

[2015-03-02 08:32:33] Padawan: So i would have a lot of classes that literally represents my pages, or parts of it, and those classes have actions at a user level perspective.

[2015-03-02 08:35:35] Dave_B_: Sounds about right Padawan
[2015-03-02 08:35:51] Dave_B_: if pages share elements you can always pull them out separately (header/footer maybe?)
[2015-03-02 08:36:04] SitamJana1, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-02 08:36:09] Dave_B_: or if groups of pages share common elements you can use inheritance or similar to keep from duplicating info

[2015-03-02 08:38:27] Padawan: True, now, in a modeling perspective, do i make the assertions directly int he test? Or should i create a layer between it? I mean, would it be critical for maintainability to hide it from the tests, and make those as readable as possible?
[2015-03-02 08:38:52] dude-x: tests only use page object methods, and asserts are used
[2015-03-02 08:38:57] dude-x: there
[2015-03-02 08:39:11] Dave_B_: personally I put the asserts in the test not the method
[2015-03-02 08:39:33] dude-x: didn't meant to imply asserts are in thet methods
[2015-03-02 08:39:42] dude-x: but that asserts are only used in the test file itself
[2015-03-02 08:39:47] Dave_B_: oh right :p
[2015-03-02 08:39:52] Dave_B_: thought you were saying the opposite
[2015-03-02 08:40:31] Dave_B_: so page object controls access to the elements and interactions, tests control, erm, what's being tested :p
[2015-03-02 08:40:39] dude-x: so you should have assert login_page.get_error_response_text == "Error"; (or assertEquals(login_page.get_error_response_text, "Error"))
[2015-03-02 08:41:01] dude-x: one thing i don't want to see from coworkers tests is a for loop in a test
[2015-03-02 08:41:09] dude-x: i also move data creation into page objects

[2015-03-02 09:07:06] shri_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-02 09:07:20] shri_: is there a way to get the By selector from a WebElement object?
[2015-03-02 09:07:37] WhereIsMySpoon: shri_: no
[2015-03-02 09:07:37] sircapsalot: shri_: nope.  you'd have to implement something custom.. which could be very difficult
[2015-03-02 09:07:42] AutomatedTester: jimevans: :)
[2015-03-02 09:08:40] shri_: it could be potentially chained with WebDriverEventListener though correct?
[2015-03-02 09:09:17] shri_: afterFindBy -> afterClickOn for example
[2015-03-02 09:10:54] Accipiter: shri_:  We have used getAttribute("id") to build a by from a WebElement, but only work if your ids are unique
[2015-03-02 09:11:24] jimevans: i sincerely wish we'd used something other than "status" for the responses in the spec version of the wire protocol
[2015-03-02 09:12:12] jimevans: or, alternately, had changed the property in the webdriver version of the protocol to be named something different.
[2015-03-02 09:12:33] kggr, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-02 09:13:22] shri_: @Accipiter yeah that works but has limitations as you mentioned
[2015-03-02 09:13:50] shri_: mainly need it for debugging multi threading problems
[2015-03-02 09:14:09] Dave_B_: shri_: To look up the element you needed a locator - can you not just make that accessible so you reuse that rather than try to derive it?
[2015-03-02 09:14:20] jimevans: problem is, you can't depend on a WebElement always being found by a call to findElement(s).
[2015-03-02 09:14:40] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: not if the lookup he's using is derived itself
[2015-03-02 09:15:41] antsanto: I belive you can get from changing source . Look at RemoteWebElement guess that should help
[2015-03-02 09:16:10] shri_: like I said I want to have something that will help be track the flow path. using WebDriverEventListener to put something in place so all event calls for click pass in the element itself.
[2015-03-02 09:16:43] AutomatedTester: jimevans: what is returned is either a string or an int, should be easy to handle
[2015-03-02 09:17:23] jimevans: AutomatedTester: you dynamic language chaps are funny :)
[2015-03-02 09:17:31] AutomatedTester: var status
[2015-03-02 09:17:35] AutomatedTester: boom
[2015-03-02 09:17:42] *AutomatedTester drops mic and walks off'
[2015-03-02 09:17:44] shri_: and the page object I am using has a proxy in front of it so selectors change based on the page the driver is looking at
[2015-03-02 09:17:44] sircapsalot: screw explicit types
[2015-03-02 09:17:45] sircapsalot: ;)
[2015-03-02 09:18:00] *jimevans picks up mic'
[2015-03-02 09:18:26] antsanto: Shri look at the source, http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-remote-driver/2.35.0/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebElement.java
[2015-03-02 09:18:36] jimevans: grab a json-to-whatever-static-typed-language serialization library, see how well that works, and get back to me.
[2015-03-02 09:18:39] antsanto: You can see foundBy variable which is private
[2015-03-02 09:18:54] antsanto: Which is what ur looking for
[2015-03-02 09:19:06] jimevans: antsanto: there's a reason that's private.
[2015-03-02 09:19:33] antsanto: jimevans whats the reason?
[2015-03-02 09:19:42] jimevans: consider the following line of java code:
[2015-03-02 09:20:15] jimevans: ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("return document.getElementById('foo');");
[2015-03-02 09:20:23] jimevans: what's the type of the object returned?
[2015-03-02 09:21:02] antsanto: I guess executeScript gives back Object sorry if im wrong
[2015-03-02 09:21:25] Accipiter: Suggestions for getting around the required displayed=true to do a click?
[2015-03-02 09:21:30] jimevans: that's the type the method returns, yes, because it's the broadest. but if you inspect the object, what can it get cast to?
[2015-03-02 09:21:36] Accipiter: JavascriptExecutor/
[2015-03-02 09:21:38] Accipiter: ?
[2015-03-02 09:21:52] shri_: can be cast to webelement?
[2015-03-02 09:22:00] jimevans: indeed it can, shri_.
[2015-03-02 09:22:16] jimevans: in that case, what would the "found by" item be set to? it wasn't found using a By locator.
[2015-03-02 09:22:38] antsanto: Ya JimEvans i can see what point ur making here.
[2015-03-02 09:22:40] shri_: right the general scope is too broad for such scenarios
[2015-03-02 09:22:40] jimevans: (i further note that the "foundBy" item mentioned by antsanto isn't a By either; it's a string)
[2015-03-02 09:23:13] antsanto: But finding element via js codes , iw that used wild?
[2015-03-02 09:23:20] antsanto: I Dont think so
[2015-03-02 09:23:23] jimevans: damned straight it is.
[2015-03-02 09:23:26] jimevans: i use it all the time.
[2015-03-02 09:23:34] antsanto: :D
[2015-03-02 09:23:36] Dave_B_: I've seen people use it quite a bit - I don't personally
[2015-03-02 09:23:45] WhereIsMySpoon: i try to avoid js usage at all
[2015-03-02 09:23:53] jimevans: particularly for javascript widget frameworks that make finding and manipulating their elements onerous.
[2015-03-02 09:23:53] WhereIsMySpoon: its rarely needed imo
[2015-03-02 09:23:54] antsanto: Dave_B your my set :)
[2015-03-02 09:24:03] shri_: yeah we have a whole suite of tests that run with JS disabled :D
[2015-03-02 09:24:03] antsanto: Lol
[2015-03-02 09:25:08] jimevans: nevertheless, the point is the WebElement API shouldn't have a "getFoundBy()" method, because it's possible for the element to not have been found via a find* method.
[2015-03-02 09:25:23] jimevans: i'm talking about api design, specifically.
[2015-03-02 09:25:39] shri_: agreed
[2015-03-02 09:25:40] jimevans: pragmatism may intrude in messier ways.
[2015-03-02 09:25:51] jimevans: but that's what wrapper libraries are for.
[2015-03-02 09:25:59] antsanto: Thats true jim!
[2015-03-02 09:26:56] jimevans: one of the biggest mistakes users of the webdriver api make is that they assume it to be the "one api to rule them all," when it really needs to be extended or wrapped for more than just the barest of uses.

[2015-03-02 09:27:21] antsanto: And sorry to repeat, any one done scrolling in Safari?
[2015-03-02 09:27:21] jimevans: and, by the way, that's the absolute *right* design for the webdriver api.
[2015-03-02 09:28:31] WhereIsMySpoon: unless they're custom built for a very specific set of use cases or a specific client, apis in general should be a framework to build on tbh
[2015-03-02 09:28:42] shri_: e = mc2
[2015-03-02 09:28:48] WhereIsMySpoon: its an application programming -interface-
[2015-03-02 09:28:50] shri_: boon and bane lol
[2015-03-02 09:28:54] sircapsalot: e = mc^2  *
[2015-03-02 09:29:05] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2015-03-02 09:29:24] shri_: technicality
[2015-03-02 09:29:38] sircapsalot: "welcome to the world of programming"
[2015-03-02 09:29:50] antsanto: Jim, webdriver is said to run in http protocol right? So in the java side, it opens the http connection .. But how does that broswer accepts that exact connection.
[2015-03-02 09:30:05] jleyba: antsanto depends on the browser
[2015-03-02 09:30:38] antsanto: Jleyba :) Ur whom I'm looking for..
[2015-03-02 09:30:51] jleyba: but there is usually an intermediate node that speaks the http protocol and translates it to something the browser understands
[2015-03-02 09:30:57] jbaranda, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-02 09:31:15] WhereIsMySpoon: e.g. marionette
[2015-03-02 09:31:22] antsanto: Whats that node?
[2015-03-02 09:31:45] antsanto: In safari I guess the connect.html injects the js , which does the job
[2015-03-02 09:31:50] antsanto: I belive
[2015-03-02 09:32:05] jleyba: safari is different
[2015-03-02 09:32:10] antsanto: Thats what your saying intermediate?
[2015-03-02 09:32:24] jleyba: no. safari doesn't use the standard http+json protocol. at all
[2015-03-02 09:32:56] jleyba: relationship is inverted. client runs a websocket server, which the safaridriver browser extension connects to
[2015-03-02 09:33:19] WhereIsMySpoon: jleyba: that sounds fun
[2015-03-02 09:34:16] antsanto: Jleyba for others all goes via an http call? Which is the http address then? Say for example in firefox
[2015-03-02 09:34:40] jleyba: WhereIsMySpoon it's actually pretty straight forward. Safari has a lot of issues - using websockets is not one of them
[2015-03-02 09:35:21] antsanto: Jleyba I face them daily! :(
[2015-03-02 09:35:43] jimevans: antsanto: how the individual driver handles the HTTP communication is up to the implementation.
[2015-03-02 09:36:23] sim2, quitting. (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[2015-03-02 09:36:28] jimevans: in the case of IE, the driver (IEDriverServer.exe) receives the HTTP communication, and uses the IE COM object model to drive the browser.
[2015-03-02 09:36:45] jleyba: chromedriver translates HTTP requests to something in Chrome's DevTools protocol
[2015-03-02 09:37:23] jimevans: in the case of firefox, the driver is (currently) implemented in a firefox extension, which receives the command via http and manipulates the browser in the context of the browser.
[2015-03-02 09:37:52] shri_: so what is the best way to implement a custom event listener - specifically one that tracks URL changes
[2015-03-02 09:38:56] antsanto: jleyba : any idea how to do scrolling in Safari?
[2015-03-02 09:41:28] shri_: you mean scroll on error?
[2015-03-02 09:41:53] jleyba: step 1) element.scrollIntoView() step 2) bash head against desk repeatedly to dull the pain of working with Safari
[2015-03-02 09:42:20] antsanto: jleyba lol !!!!
[2015-03-02 09:42:55] sircapsalot: i gotta say, i am loving the little subtle tweaks that stackoverflow has been doing lately. looks so nice
[2015-03-02 09:43:11] antsanto: Really nothing works file uploads, scroll , actions.. Nothing :( as u said should be doing step 2 :D
[2015-03-02 09:44:24] WhereIsMySpoon: i thought safari driver was discontinued
[2015-03-02 09:44:25] jleyba: 1) file uploads will probably never happen for Safari due to limitations of js 2) i find testing uploads with webdriver very suspect
[2015-03-02 09:44:43] jleyba: 3) scrolling and actions api are possible but not implemented
[2015-03-02 09:45:31] antsanto: For scrolling atleast you can say me the ways, atleast I can give it a try!

[2015-03-02 09:52:30] WhereIsMySpoon: ^
[2015-03-02 09:52:43] jleyba: best to assume you need to use a wait after every click that is expected to trigger a page load

[2015-03-02 09:53:26] WhereIsMySpoon: rofl
[2015-03-02 09:53:28] shri_: yeah but my scenario is flipped
[2015-03-02 09:53:35] WhereIsMySpoon: i was trying to make a joke but that flopped xD
[2015-03-02 09:53:54] shri_: I am tracking all element clicks and not sure which one will trigger a new page load
[2015-03-02 09:54:16] shri_: so essentially I need a way to tell of the URL has changed post click
[2015-03-02 09:54:52] jleyba: compare url pre and post click?
[2015-03-02 09:55:17] jleyba: add a breadcrumb to the page with executeScript, check if it's still there post click
[2015-03-02 09:55:25] shri_: that's what I am doing but the call isn't blocked all the time
[2015-03-02 09:55:52] shri_: I can't "wait" for page url to change as there is no saying the url will change
[2015-03-02 09:56:02] shri_: think I need a drink
[2015-03-02 09:56:12] jleyba: are you trying to crawl someone else's app?
[2015-03-02 09:56:27] WhereIsMySpoon: shri_: atta boy, we'll make you an alcoholic yet
[2015-03-02 09:56:27] davehunt: lukeis: any news on the Selenium Conference
[2015-03-02 09:56:30] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-03-02 09:56:34] Titus: As to the Firefox performance issue... the commit message says this only affects Linux, but we're seeing the same performance hit on Windows tests as well
[2015-03-02 09:57:12] lukeis: davehunt: did you see it got rescheduled for later in the year?
[2015-03-02 09:57:17] shri_: I am still hungover from last night lol
[2015-03-02 09:57:27] davehunt: lukeis: I didn't see that :) is there a post on it?
[2015-03-02 09:57:32] admc, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-03-02 09:57:33] WhereIsMySpoon: shri_: calls for a drink to help it
[2015-03-02 09:57:36] shri_: no not trying to test my own app
[2015-03-02 09:57:44] lukeis: davehunt: of course not ;) â€¦
[2015-03-02 09:58:16] shri_: the problem is my page object implementation changes based on the URL the app is looking at
[2015-03-02 09:58:40] shri_: so the only way I can tell my proxy object to delegate calls to the right implementation is to track URL changes
[2015-03-02 10:00:05] jleyba: maybe use a proxy to monitor browser traffic?
[2015-03-02 10:00:33] shri_: not an option unfortunately
[2015-03-02 10:00:59] jleyba: with webdriver it's going to boil down to "wait for N ms, see if URL has changed"
[2015-03-02 10:01:43] lukeis: davehunt: here's the notes from the meeting that changed the timeline: "- No good venues available for date in May, early June is available
[2015-03-02 10:01:43] lukeis: - Decided to push the conference into the Fall. Looking at sometime in September. Date TBD, but will avoid STAR WEST dates"
[2015-03-02 10:02:00] davehunt: lukeis: great, thanks
[2015-03-02 10:02:18] lukeis: followed by "- Looking to stick with Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday conference days (e.g., SeptemberÂ 8-10, September 15-17)"

[2015-03-02 10:03:47] lukeis: next call is this wednesdayâ€¦ hopefully i remember to join :)
[2015-03-02 10:04:06] Titus: Where is the conference going to be this year?
[2015-03-02 10:04:28] lukeis: portland, oregon
[2015-03-02 10:04:41] Titus: Excellent. My mom is going to like that.
[2015-03-02 10:04:52] shri_: @jleyba pretty much but a click on textbox for example that doesn't trigger a URL change will wait for nothing
[2015-03-02 10:05:09] shri_: and also the fact that if the page load takes more than N ms for whatever reason it will be a false positive
[2015-03-02 10:05:27] shri_: rock > shri < hardplace
[2015-03-02 10:07:26] shri_: where can I look for the logic in webdriver that tries to determine page url change?

[2015-03-02 10:09:29] jleyba: shri_ that's a browser-specific piece of logic
[2015-03-02 10:10:12] shri_: more drinks
[2015-03-02 10:10:21] WhereIsMySpoon: hahahaha
[2015-03-02 10:10:26] shri_: how the hell did I get myself here ...
[2015-03-02 10:10:46] shri_: is form submit considered blocking call as well?
[2015-03-02 10:10:56] jimevans: for some definition of "blocking". :)
[2015-03-02 10:11:24] shri_: lol
[2015-03-02 10:11:38] shri_: well I do appreciate the answers and help you guys give here
[2015-03-02 10:11:49] shri_: better than going against the wall
[2015-03-02 10:11:49] jimevans: there are no guarantees of blocking on click() beyond "best effort"
[2015-03-02 10:12:40] jimevans: and this is exactly the reason why. there's no way to do asynchronous clicks (which native events are) and *not* have a potential race condition when page navigation happens.
[2015-03-02 10:14:32] shri_: maybe I should move the check inside the proxy delegation call
[2015-03-02 10:15:37] jleyba: what browser are you working with?
[2015-03-02 10:15:39] shri_: well no then I won't have previous URL .... dangit!
[2015-03-02 10:15:41] shri_: ugghhh
[2015-03-02 10:15:53] fabrice31, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-02 10:16:04] shri_: chrome and firefox for the most part
[2015-03-02 10:16:19] shri_: haven't even thought about IE and safari stuff
[2015-03-02 10:17:38] jleyba: Safari is pretty good at detecting page loads - Apple actually provides an API for that

[2015-03-02 10:26:13] shri_: and just for kickers there is a request header set by the app that will give me exactly what I want to track url change lol
[2015-03-02 10:26:58] jimevans: shri_: not to sound like a broken record, but that kind of thing is tailor-made for a web proxy.
[2015-03-02 10:27:10] shri_: yep
[2015-03-02 10:28:17] shri_: but they ask me to write code with my hands tied behind my back
[2015-03-02 10:28:24] shri_: *shrugs*
[2015-03-02 10:28:38] jleyba: might also be able to use a browser extension. i've seen teams here do some very cool stuff with webdriver+browser extensions

[2015-03-02 11:22:47] barancev: and a similar maven artefact
[2015-03-02 11:22:55] lukeis: barancev: you mean upload?
[2015-03-02 11:23:04] lukeis: did you make a maven artifact? :)
[2015-03-02 11:23:17] lukeis: and why isn't the leg-rc in the zip?
[2015-03-02 11:23:57] barancev: I mean 1) a jar-file build\dist\leg-rc-2.45.0.jar -> http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/
[2015-03-02 11:24:15] barancev: 2) a similar maven artifact to the maven central
[2015-03-02 11:24:19] lukeis: no, can you adjust the build script to include that jar in the zip
[2015-03-02 11:24:27] barancev: it is not in zip because it is RC :)
[2015-03-02 11:24:42] lukeis: that's never been the intention for 2.X
[2015-03-02 11:24:57] barancev: let it be out of the zip file :)
[2015-03-02 11:24:58] lukeis: please adjust the build scripts to include it
[2015-03-02 11:25:01] lukeis: no...
[2015-03-02 11:25:22] barancev: we don't remove it. we just deploy it as a separate file
[2015-03-02 11:25:29] cristi, quitting. (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[2015-03-02 11:26:16] barancev: it is incuded into selenium-server-standalone
[2015-03-02 11:26:25] barancev: because it is standalone
[2015-03-02 11:26:30] lukeis: then it should be in the java zip file
[2015-03-02 11:26:42] barancev: why?
[2015-03-02 11:26:47] lukeis: o.0
[2015-03-02 11:27:05] lukeis: because we aren't releasing the removal of RC yet?
[2015-03-02 11:27:12] jimevans: i'm with lukeis on this one. i hate rc with the passion of a thousand suns, but dammit, you can't remove it before 3.0
[2015-03-02 11:27:13] barancev: it is not removal :)
[2015-03-02 11:27:24] lukeis: this is effectively the same thing
[2015-03-02 11:27:26] jimevans: if it's not in the zip file, it's removed.
[2015-03-02 11:27:35] jimevans: (from a user
[2015-03-02 11:27:40] jimevans: 's perspective)
[2015-03-02 11:29:04] barancev: disagree :)
[2015-03-02 11:30:39] barancev: are we going to release 3.0-pre-release in parallel with 2.x?
[2015-03-02 11:31:25] jimevans: so for years, you've been downloading an artifact, a single .zip file, which allowed you to use both RC and webdriver in a client environment (*NOT* the standalone server). now, without any warning, it's not there anymore. especially when we announced 3.0 would do that, but with no guidance that 2.x would.
[2015-03-02 11:31:29] jimevans: it's a breaking change.
[2015-03-02 11:31:46] jimevans: a no-warning breaking change
[2015-03-02 11:32:15] jleyba: there will be no parallel releases. when 3.0 hits on April 1, Selenium 1.0 must be downloaded from a separate artifact
[2015-03-02 11:32:31] jleyba: until that time, it should be bundled with 2.x releases (as it has been)

[2015-03-02 11:49:03] ato: Yeah, it would be nice to keep the history.  I've seen a few other projects migrate issues from GC to Github successfully.
[2015-03-02 11:49:28] ato: I'm also in favour of issue bankruptcy.
[2015-03-02 11:49:52] shri_: are there still known issues with FF and Sauce? I remember them saying not to use 2.44.0 with latest FF or something along those lines
[2015-03-02 11:50:16] jleyba: shri_: 2.44.0 only officially supports FF 24, 31, 32, 33
[2015-03-02 11:50:27] jleyba: 2.45.0 is needed for 35 & 36

[2015-03-02 13:13:15] nirvdrum: If this is just about the client connecting to the server (whether that's Selenium Server or the Grid Hub), then I think this is fine.  If it's about the Grid Hub talking to the nodes or vice versa, I think changing it is probably wrong.

[2015-03-02 13:14:03] nirvdrum: Having said that, a client connecting to the hub that times out early still has a request in the hub queue.  So it's just trading off one problem for a really bad one elsewhere.  A great deal of my time spent on Mogotest was around intelligent scheduling to avoid that problem.

[2015-03-02 13:16:21] nirvdrum: ato: Do you have any insight as to why either a page load, session, or the IE-specific browser attach timeout doesn't work for #3951?
[2015-03-02 13:17:33] ato: I haven't read the issue properly, but I'm guessing the remote end might have bugs that cause it to leave the socket open indefinitely, or at least more than three hours.
[2015-03-02 13:18:07] ato: For example if the driver goes into an infinite loop or hangs otherwise.
[2015-03-02 13:18:10] nirvdrum: Well, I don't think those timeouts are being set by the client.  But I think at least one of them should be sufficient.

[2015-03-02 13:19:26] ato: Basically the presumption on HttpCommandExecutor's side is that this situation Should Never Happen.
[2015-03-02 13:19:42] ato: And yet it does, possibly because the user has incorrectly configure their session timeout.
[2015-03-02 13:19:58] ato: Which, as I understand it, should kick in and interrupt an HTTP command to the driver.
[2015-03-02 13:20:10] nirvdrum: I believe the assumption is, you'll either get a response before the socket times out or you'll have configured a higher level timeout to abort earlier.

[2015-03-02 14:07:06] lukeis: doesn't care about using "needs clarification" label anymoreâ€¦ "closed / not reproducible" much better

[2015-03-02 23:17:23] yoeri: And I added the wd_host param in my behat.yml
