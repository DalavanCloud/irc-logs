[2015-03-23 06:26:31] AutomatedTester: Dave_B_: ?
[2015-03-23 06:26:41] Dave_B_: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Platforms#Supported_Platforms says 2.2
[2015-03-23 06:26:49] Dave_B_: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Platforms/Android#System_Requirements says 2.3
[2015-03-23 06:27:03] Dave_B_: not a big difference but still :p
[2015-03-23 06:27:19] AutomatedTester: they are currently sorting min version stuff atm
[2015-03-23 06:27:32] Dave_B_: :) that could explain it
[2015-03-23 06:27:38] AutomatedTester: Dave_B_: we are splitting the APK
[2015-03-23 06:27:59] AutomatedTester: so one group of people get 1 APK and another get a different one
[2015-03-23 06:28:12] AutomatedTester: so we can make the APK smaller for everyone
[2015-03-23 06:28:20] Dave_B_: cool :)
[2015-03-23 06:28:25] AutomatedTester: and its split along android versions
[2015-03-23 06:29:38] AutomatedTester: Dave_B_: I shall ask quickly
[2015-03-23 06:29:54] Dave_B_: awesome :D
[2015-03-23 06:30:01] Dave_B_: <3
[2015-03-23 06:30:44] Dave_B_: (my googling has now suggested that from FF 31.0 it requires 2.3+ so the second source is the 'right' one, but I'd not guarantee it :p)

[2015-03-23 11:00:57] lukeis: feel free to :ask :)
[2015-03-23 11:02:25] asxbr: how can i make an automated test in sign up, that have fields unique on database (like e-mail, Individual registration code) ?
[2015-03-23 11:02:58] lukeis: generate a unique user?
[2015-03-23 11:03:00] asxbr: to complete de sign up i need to always change the value of that fields
[2015-03-23 11:03:13] asxbr: the*
[2015-03-23 11:03:33] dude-x: whenver you need to make testing simpler, that means talking to the developer or rewriting your code to support test hooks to make testing easier
[2015-03-23 11:03:37] lukeis: "new-user" + UUID + "@domain.com"
[2015-03-23 11:03:45] lukeis: :google UUID
[2015-03-23 11:04:31] asxbr: oh
[2015-03-23 11:04:33] dude-x: newuser + timestamp of 20150323140134 should be sufficient for simple uniqueness
[2015-03-23 11:04:42] lukeis: usually
[2015-03-23 11:05:01] lukeis: until you run in a highly parallelized environment and two tests get the timestamps at the same time ;)
[2015-03-23 11:05:29] dude-x: i get it down to .000000 precision
[2015-03-23 11:05:43] dude-x: no conflicts there :p
[2015-03-23 11:05:45] lukeis: refers to previous statement
[2015-03-23 11:06:27] asxbr: in case of a field that is unique and have a specific logic validation
[2015-03-23 11:06:39] asxbr: in brazil we have CPF
[2015-03-23 11:06:46] p0deje, quitting. (Quit: p0deje)
[2015-03-23 11:06:49] asxbr: it have 11 numeric digits, with a specific logic
[2015-03-23 11:06:56] dude-x: actually this isn't a problem i worry about with my current system because every test uses names that are particular to the test
[2015-03-23 11:07:26] asxbr: and this field is unique
[2015-03-23 11:07:43] asxbr: my worry is the test fail with the unique constraint
[2015-03-23 11:08:07] asxbr: 11 digits can repeat one time

[2015-03-23 11:29:27] sircapsalot: at one time, 2.

[2015-03-23 11:30:48] zaiditime: dockered grid + EC2
[2015-03-23 11:31:12] zaiditime: have you seen the grid usage to be cpu heavy vs memory?
[2015-03-23 11:31:13] sircapsalot: it all depends on your needs.. we kick off our tests at 1am since not a lot of users are on at that time
[2015-03-23 11:31:25] sircapsalot: CPU is always the worst.. but i actually created a python script to fetch the cheapest ec2 node and use that for all my nodes.
[2015-03-23 11:31:30] zaiditime: we kick off our tests every build (commit)
[2015-03-23 11:31:41] zaiditime: so you are doing on demand ?
[2015-03-23 11:31:44] sircapsalot: and it usually ends up being m3.medium being cheapest believe it or not.
[2015-03-23 11:31:45] sircapsalot: no
[2015-03-23 11:31:47] sircapsalot: spot-requests
[2015-03-23 11:32:07] zaiditime: so if they kick it from under you, you just go to on demand?
[2015-03-23 11:32:25] lukeis: if it's in a grid environment, shouldn't matter
[2015-03-23 11:32:26] sircapsalot: no, my script will detect if we have no nodes up, and kick up more depending on the cheapest option
[2015-03-23 11:32:44] zaiditime: okay
[2015-03-23 11:32:50] zaiditime: so cpu is worst than memory
[2015-03-23 11:32:53] lukeis: (except for that one test that dies in the middle of running ;) )
[2015-03-23 11:32:58] sircapsalot: i wish i could share it with you, but it's sort of my employers property :|
[2015-03-23 11:33:07] lukeis: fail :)
[2015-03-23 11:33:17] sircapsalot: lukeis that's why i implement retries ;) ha
[2015-03-23 11:33:28] zaiditime: thats why i dont like the spot, currently during the test phaes of using ec2, M3 spot instance we are losing nodes when price shoots up
[2015-03-23 11:33:29] lukeis: yeah… everyone does retries :'(
[2015-03-23 11:33:37] lukeis: (except google…)
[2015-03-23 11:33:39] sircapsalot: right - yea
[2015-03-23 11:33:40] zaiditime: not worth the risk when you have 100 developers waiting to commit
[2015-03-23 11:33:51] sircapsalot: zaiditime i know exactly what you mean.  the price fluxuates mad lately

[2015-03-23 14:15:21] Anconio: using CSS syntax...is it possible to traverse the DOM upwards?
[2015-03-23 14:15:37] Anconio: go up 2 levels...and then select relative to that?

[2015-03-23 14:16:42] lukeis: as an alternative to xpath
[2015-03-23 14:17:23] Anconio: are JS selectors favorable over XPath?
[2015-03-23 14:17:28] jleyba: YEs
[2015-03-23 14:17:46] Anconio: so XPath is truly last resort?
[2015-03-23 14:17:50] jleyba: imho
[2015-03-23 14:18:04] jleyba: I've seen enough teams shoot themselves in the foot relying on XPath
[2015-03-23 14:18:16] Anconio: i trust your judgement...curious as to why...mind you I have struggled with XPath
[2015-03-23 14:18:30] Anconio: so XPath is a just "brittle"
[2015-03-23 14:18:46] lukeis: you can make brittle locators with just about anything though
[2015-03-23 14:18:52] jleyba: xpath users seem to incur technical debt faster when using xpath
[2015-03-23 14:18:53] lukeis: (from my experience ;) )
[2015-03-23 14:20:00] Anconio: sometime last week I was over at elemental selenium and there was a couple of articles/postings on XPath vs. CSS selectors...but nothing was really mentioned about choosing one over the other
[2015-03-23 14:20:14] Anconio: it was mainly about differences in performance
[2015-03-23 14:20:43] ato: Any locator which includes traversing up the tree is quite brittle in my opinion.
[2015-03-23 14:20:57] jleyba: That's a big issue. IE doesn't support XPath, so WebDriver has to inject a JS implementation
[2015-03-23 14:21:03] lukeis: my order of preference (especially with how the W3C spec of webdriver is coming along):  CSS, javascript, tell the UI developers to change something to use one of the former :)
[2015-03-23 14:21:11] dude-x: it's not just performance, xpath can do sophisticated text processing and travel up and down the DOM to access things.
[2015-03-23 14:21:18] Anconio: woah, IE doesn't support XPath at all?
[2015-03-23 14:21:23] jleyba: nope
[2015-03-23 14:21:29] lukeis: not natively until IE11 ;)
[2015-03-23 14:21:36] lukeis: (and i don't think that's release yet)
[2015-03-23 14:21:39] Anconio: wow...
[2015-03-23 14:21:49] jleyba: lukeis, I thought it was targeted for IE.next (not IE11)
[2015-03-23 14:21:59] lukeis: i'll ask john tomorrow :)
[2015-03-23 14:22:23] *jleyba wonders if they're adding xpath b/c it's in the webdriver spec'
[2015-03-23 14:22:32] AutomatedTester: it's on their list of things to implement
[2015-03-23 14:22:33] lukeis: there was a blog post on it
[2015-03-23 14:22:38] ato: XPath is ridiculously complex because it allows for recursive functions, which are a great feature in a programming language, but which you probably don't need in an element selector unless you're already in such a bad state that you can't change or make assumptions about the state of the rest of the document.
[2015-03-23 14:22:43] AutomatedTester: slightly more than considering iirc
[2015-03-23 14:23:02] ato: Also I'd argue that Turing completeness in a selector is usually a sign that you're headed in the wrong direction.

[2015-03-23 14:25:28] ato: It didn't when I started working on my patch.

[2015-03-23 14:28:10] ato: What I don't like about ES6 classes is that it introduces another indentation level.
[2015-03-23 14:28:21] ato: They're very Java-esque.
[2015-03-23 14:28:35] AutomatedTester: ato: you know JS was meant to look like Java right?
[2015-03-23 14:28:49] ato: I wish they were more like structs and attached methods in Go.

[2015-03-23 14:29:54] ato: jleyba: Oh I was going to say earlier, that the V8 teams' proposals on optional typing and hardening of JS is very interesting.

[2015-03-23 14:30:19] ato: “strengthening JS” I think is what they said.

[2015-03-23 14:30:35] jleyba: oh, it's "Strong Mode" and "SoundScript"
[2015-03-23 14:30:42] ato: Yes, that's it.

[2015-03-23 14:31:00] ato: That, combined with ES6, would make JS an appealing choice to me.

[2015-03-23 15:00:31] lukeis: are you asking for marionette?
[2015-03-23 15:00:34] AutomatedTester: can IE*
[2015-03-23 15:00:53] AutomatedTester: asking for IE
[2015-03-23 15:01:03] AutomatedTester: i appear to have missed the E
[2015-03-23 15:01:05] lukeis: it's handled with the Standalone Server (or IE Driver server, can't remember) by setting the OS level proxy config
[2015-03-23 15:01:55] lukeis: and then REALLY, NO REALLY, don't run more than one IE Driver instance on a box :)

[2015-03-23 15:04:48] jleyba: Used to be handled via the standalone server, but functionality was moved into IEDS

[2015-03-23 15:32:20] dude-x: Brandon Rhodes (a notable Pythonista) wants to know is there a way to batch is_displayed called via ExecuteScript
[2015-03-23 15:32:49] dude-x: that would be kind of cool to call find elements and have the is displayed coded ran on the browser
[2015-03-23 15:33:00] dude-x: rather than routed back to the language client
[2015-03-23 15:33:02] lukeis: only if you implement your own "visibility" algorithm in javascript to pass in with it
[2015-03-23 15:33:30] lukeis: the problem is the is displayed call is extremely expensive and is only going to get worse
[2015-03-23 15:33:38] jleyba: dude-x, You can compile the JS fragement that defines is_displayed and inject that if you want
[2015-03-23 15:34:06] dude-x: he posted a stack overflow question about this
[2015-03-23 15:34:20] dude-x: so you have to copy and paste that is displayed code?
[2015-03-23 15:34:29] ato: You can run the atom as an injected script.
[2015-03-23 15:34:30] dude-x: or is there a way to refernece it.
[2015-03-23 15:34:37] dude-x: reference iit.
[2015-03-23 15:34:37] jleyba: no way to reference it
[2015-03-23 15:34:47] ato: Over a sequence of elements.
[2015-03-23 15:35:00] jleyba: you compile it, load the .js file as a string, pass it to executeScript
[2015-03-23 15:35:09] ato: The atom usually lives in the driver, not the binding.
[2015-03-23 15:35:20] ato: So no way to reference it.
[2015-03-23 15:35:36] lukeis: dude-x: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-server/src/main/java/io/selendroid/server/model/js/AndroidAtoms.java#L6932-L7542   :)
[2015-03-23 15:35:39] ato: I keep repeating jleyba.
[2015-03-23 15:35:49] *lukeis laughs at ato and jleyba'
[2015-03-23 15:36:11] jleyba: lukeis, probably optimized for andorid?
[2015-03-23 15:36:15] *ato is on a train'
[2015-03-23 15:36:18] lukeis: nope
[2015-03-23 15:36:22] lukeis: it's the atoms
[2015-03-23 15:36:25] dimacus, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-03-23 15:36:31] jleyba: yes, and the atoms can be compiled to target a specific user agent
[2015-03-23 15:36:33] lukeis: a bit old, but still the "is displayed" generated
[2015-03-23 15:36:36] jleyba: strip out code paths that are irrelevant
[2015-03-23 15:36:47] lukeis: yeah, should figure that out for selendroid at some bit
[2015-03-23 15:37:15] jleyba: ./go //javascript/atoms/fragments:is_displayed:android
[2015-03-23 15:37:20] jleyba: :)
[2015-03-23 15:37:40] AutomatedTester: I think batch doing is_displayed will make you very sad
[2015-03-23 15:38:01] jleyba: ^ will probably trigger an unresponsive script dialog too
[2015-03-23 15:38:05] lukeis: jleyba: i don't believe that strips out the conditionals in the JS code though?
[2015-03-23 15:38:11] AutomatedTester: it will probably work 90% of the time but when it doesnt you will be extremely sad
[2015-03-23 15:38:41] jleyba: lukeis, sets some "pre-compile" macros so the compiler can identify dead-code paths (e.g. all the IE specific paths will be stripped out)
[2015-03-23 15:38:59] lukeis: cool, then i think we already use that
[2015-03-23 15:39:19] jleyba: doesn't look like it saves that much.  47K vs 41K
[2015-03-23 15:39:34] jleyba: guess 5K is significant for an injected script
[2015-03-23 15:41:03] jleyba: btw, example of loading and injecting an atom fragment: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/atoms/CompiledAtomsNotLeakingTest.java
