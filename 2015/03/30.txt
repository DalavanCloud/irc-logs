[2015-03-30 00:35:16] SeKu2: I've came to the problem with selenium firefox webdriver
[2015-03-30 00:37:28] SeKu2: for a long time the case when went to active element (input field) sent keys and with ENTER in the end it kept focus and in next step I could send DOWN_KEY and go newly displayed elements, but few days ago, it keeps loosing focus after new elements are displayed
[2015-03-30 00:38:04] SeKu2: It is reproducible only via selenium webdriver. By manual redo everything works

[2015-03-30 12:09:15] jleyba: Nope
[2015-03-30 12:09:33] jleyba: WebDriver doesn't track tabs. It forces everything to open in a new window

[2015-03-30 12:10:10] Padawan: what is the way to deal with it?

[2015-03-30 12:10:52] Padawan: okay, so it still belongs to the driver variable

[2015-03-30 15:25:29] sevaseva: barancev: I see. I have no educated opinion about how much value that better  EventFiringWebDriver alternative implementation can add, but i think that extending public API surface (new interface, RemoteWebDriver implementing it) has certain negative value. Hopefully the thing you are building has larger positive value.
[2015-03-30 15:26:17] barancev: setFileDetector is already a part of the API
[2015-03-30 15:26:38] barancev: but it is not declared in any interface
[2015-03-30 15:26:50] sevaseva: So in general I would feel better if adding more public API was always explicitly justified. But that's just me
[2015-03-30 15:27:47] sevaseva: right; adding interface and making public class implementing that interface extends public API surface (even if the method was already a part of the public API)
[2015-03-30 15:28:46] jleyba:  if there's any motion on setFileDetector, can it be towards killing it :)
[2015-03-30 15:29:09] jleyba: feels like a broken abstraction to me
[2015-03-30 15:30:16] barancev: well, ok, may be you're right, let me revert it, there is no strong need to proxy this leaky method

[2015-03-30 15:31:21] jleyba: barancev, sevaseva what do you think about something like new FileInput(webelement).attach(file)
[2015-03-30 15:31:23] sevaseva: barancev: That makes me feel better, thank you :)
[2015-03-30 15:32:02] barancev: what I really-really dislike in the current inheritance tree is FirefoxDriver (and other ones) extends RemoteWebDriver
[2015-03-30 15:32:13] lukeis: jleyba: can you call it something other than the RC api does? ;)
[2015-03-30 15:32:27] jimevans: .upload(file)
[2015-03-30 15:32:30] lukeis: +1
[2015-03-30 15:32:56] lukeis: and if we're talking javaâ€¦ upload(File)
[2015-03-30 15:33:04] jleyba: jimevans, that works. Was thinking about multi-file inputs though
[2015-03-30 15:33:11] jleyba: .attach(file1).attach(file2).upload()
[2015-03-30 15:33:14] lukeis: upload(File â€¦)

[2015-03-30 15:34:09] jleyba: Ok. upload(File ...) it is
[2015-03-30 15:34:22] jleyba: Well... upload(Path...)
[2015-03-30 15:34:30] jleyba: need to stop this Java6 nonsense and move on
[2015-03-30 15:34:56] lukeis: the spec doesn't mention file input types :-/
[2015-03-30 15:35:17] barancev: because we don't know input types on the client side
[2015-03-30 15:35:28] jleyba: let's be honest, they're an afterthought in the API
[2015-03-30 15:35:58] jleyba: barancev, the FileInput wrapper class could verify the element type on creation
[2015-03-30 15:36:41] barancev: yes, but the main purpose of file detector currently is uploading files to the remove selenium server
[2015-03-30 15:37:03] barancev: and converting local paths to remote ones
[2015-03-30 15:37:06] sevaseva: Wait, but the method won't actually upload the file (yet). Upload (or attach) doesn't feel like the right verb to me. How about pick or select or ... ?
[2015-03-30 15:37:09] jleyba: Right. But the whole reason it exists is the broken mechanic of "oh i'm typing on a file input, i need to look for files"
[2015-03-30 15:38:08] jleyba: I'm suggesting make the API specific (at the cost of verbosity)
[2015-03-30 15:38:14] jimevans: sevaseva: actually, if it wraps the sendKeys method, it will, in fact, upload
[2015-03-30 15:38:16] barancev: the reason is the need to upload a file to the remote server
[2015-03-30 15:39:40] barancev: if you run a browser locally you don't need a file detector
[2015-03-30 15:40:07] barancev: let the browser do the job of finding and attaching the file
[2015-03-30 15:40:10] sevaseva: barancev: locally AND also without the Java Server
[2015-03-30 15:40:33] barancev: sevaseva: no matter
[2015-03-30 15:41:24] barancev: because you just send the path to the browser
[2015-03-30 15:41:44] barancev: the path on the local machine
[2015-03-30 15:42:00] jleyba: barancev, Seva's point was if you install a file detector it will xfer the file to the remote server
[2015-03-30 15:42:13] sevaseva: barancev: ah, right. you don't *need* it but currently it will be used anyway if the java server is used, as I understand it
[2015-03-30 15:42:13] jleyba: even if it's a localhost xfer, it's still an unnecessary copy
[2015-03-30 15:42:43] barancev: yes, unnecessary work
[2015-03-30 15:43:34] barancev: and if you run a server locally with default file detector -- there is no unnecessary work, no uploading
[2015-03-30 15:46:44] sevaseva: lukeis: regarding your comment - I think here we talk about another client side 'helper' class as https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/c2c6b4302a389ba74d4323d976be2ada6ed16c6c/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/Select.java for example
[2015-03-30 15:47:12] sevaseva: if that's what everyone is thinking - then it is okay that the spec doesn't have anything about FileInput
[2015-03-30 15:48:49] jleyba: sevaseva, there needs to be something in the spec about "this is how you attach a file to a file input element"
[2015-03-30 15:49:16] sevaseva: jleyba: I agree
[2015-03-30 15:49:32] jleyba: currently, this is implicitly handled by the sendKeys command
[2015-03-30 15:50:25] sevaseva: but (since Level 1 wants to be as compatible with The Reference Implementation and existing drivers as possible) shouldn't this new API be kept out of Level 1. I guess that is a separate question..
[2015-03-30 15:51:08] jleyba: two problems: (1) how should file inputs be handled at the protocol level (implicit action of sendKeys or new end point)
[2015-03-30 15:51:18] jleyba: (2) how to represent it in the client API
[2015-03-30 15:51:43] jleyba: I think both are broken in current implementation but you're right that it's probably too late to address (1) in the spec
[2015-03-30 15:51:44] seljenkinsbot: Yippee, build fixed!
[2015-03-30 15:51:45] seljenkinsbot: Project IE 10 Java Tests build #1775: FIXED in 12 min: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/IE%2010%20Java%20Tests/1775/
[2015-03-30 15:52:03] barancev: let's also keep in mind the case of hidden file inputs
[2015-03-30 15:52:25] jleyba: good point.. does sendKeys check files or visibility first?
[2015-03-30 15:52:38] barancev: it does
[2015-03-30 15:53:52] barancev: so if one wants to attach a file to an invisible file input field one should first make it visible via JavascriptExecutor
[2015-03-30 15:54:48] farlan, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-30 15:54:59] sevaseva: jleyba: So I guess we could design the client side representation and the new remote end endpoint(s) in a way that the client side stuff won't change when we eventually (c) switch to the new server side implementation
[2015-03-30 15:56:28] sevaseva: barancev: or simply declare that explicitly unsupported (leave javascript to the clever users if they want it) until there's a new world where remote end handles file uploads nicely?
[2015-03-30 15:57:07] barancev: sevaseva: hidden file inputs are very populat novadays
[2015-03-30 15:57:36] barancev: http://barancev.github.io/how-to-attach-file-to-invisible-field/ -- it is in Russian, but code samples are international :)
[2015-03-30 15:59:29] rexbutler: Is there an IRC channel for appium?
[2015-03-30 15:59:51] lukeis: rexbutler: no, they use something else
[2015-03-30 16:00:05] rexbutler: lukeis: What would that be?
[2015-03-30 16:00:09] rexbutler: github something or other?
[2015-03-30 16:00:17] lukeis: http://appium.io/get-involved.html?lang=en
[2015-03-30 16:00:18] sevaseva: barancev: I actually don't have a strong opinion on that, just offered an idea, brainstorming
[2015-03-30 16:00:49] rexbutler: lukeis: Thanks!
[2015-03-30 16:02:21] sevaseva: barancev: in general (given that an error of course can happen at any time [e.g. when restoring the element to be hidden again] and user/test is free to handle errors as they please) ... hiding and showing user page's elements secretly sounds dangerous to me
[2015-03-30 16:03:17] barancev: yes, dangerous
[2015-03-30 16:03:36] barancev: that's why we have to change the current state
[2015-03-30 16:03:50] barancev: to stop provoking users
[2015-03-30 16:03:52] jleyba: changing visibility triggers CSS reflows. we shouldn't require that for file inputs
[2015-03-30 16:04:06] sevaseva: so I wouldn't do it unless I hear from very many users that the value it could bring is enormous :)
[2015-03-30 16:04:35] barancev: we just need interactable property
[2015-03-30 16:04:43] barancev: interactable != displayed
[2015-03-30 16:05:06] barancev: opacity:0 is interactable despite invisible
[2015-03-30 16:06:50] jimevans: file uploads are a necessity for users, but chronically challenging because of the implied behavior of sendKeys on <input type='file'> elements. the natural thing for users to do is call click() because that's what a physical user does to trigger the file upload
[2015-03-30 16:08:15] jimevans: additionally, <input type='file'> elements are often hidden by lots of widget frameworks today
[2015-03-30 16:09:45] sevaseva: jimevans: and interacting with those widgets (as user would) doesn't typically give the expected result?
[2015-03-30 16:09:50] jleyba: jimevans, right.. that's why I was proposing removing it from the WebElement interface all together and introducing a helper class with the appropriate idioms
[2015-03-30 16:09:59] Padawan, quitting. (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[2015-03-30 16:10:19] barancev: helper class does not resolve visibility issure
[2015-03-30 16:10:25] jimevans: sevaseva: calling click() certainly doesn't, because it blocks with a dialog in most cases.
[2015-03-30 16:10:51] barancev: unless we implement "unhiding" (phew!)
[2015-03-30 16:10:52] jimevans: jleyba: i don't necessarily disagree, but you really kinda need a new end point.
[2015-03-30 16:11:06] jimevans: please note i'm against automatically "unhiding"
[2015-03-30 16:11:17] jimevans: strongly against
[2015-03-30 16:11:21] barancev: me too
[2015-03-30 16:12:04] barancev: we need interactable property
[2015-03-30 16:12:14] jleyba: jimevans, lukeis did say file inputs aren't in the spec yet, so we could define the new end point
[2015-03-30 16:12:26] barancev: a user can interact with transparent elements
[2015-03-30 16:12:28] jimevans: sure.
[2015-03-30 16:13:05] jimevans: there's a spec bug currently on the fact that <input type='file'> behavior isn't called out in the spec
[2015-03-30 16:13:22] jleyba: barancev, i haven't kept up with the spec, but the atoms already ignore opacity for interactibility (opacity does impact isDisplayed though)
[2015-03-30 16:13:36] barancev: elements that can be scrolled into view in an overflow:hidden block are interactable too
[2015-03-30 16:13:40] bbarke, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-03-30 16:14:14] jleyba: overflow? la la la la I can't hear you
[2015-03-30 16:14:44] jimevans: visibility is hard. let's go shopping.
[2015-03-30 16:15:21] jleyba: for x, y in element.boundingBox: if hitTest(x, y) === element: return visible
[2015-03-30 16:15:25] jleyba: done
[2015-03-30 16:16:36] barancev: hit-test is not a pure fuction (that is side-effect free)
[2015-03-30 16:17:10] jleyba: someone should probably hook up with the pointer event folk
[2015-03-30 16:17:19] barancev: at least if you allow scrolling :)
[2015-03-30 16:17:55] jleyba: barancev, perform a hit test on the parent and scroll if that succeeds?
[2015-03-30 16:18:38] barancev: yes, and it is a side-effect
[2015-03-30 16:19:11] barancev: scrolling is an action
[2015-03-30 16:19:36] jleyba: have a read-only mode: isVisibleOrCouldBeMadeVisibleWithScroll()
[2015-03-30 16:20:18] barancev: omg
[2015-03-30 16:20:54] lukeis: :'(
[2015-03-30 16:21:10] barancev: I like the idea of hit-test, actually
[2015-03-30 16:21:48] jleyba: It's come up a bunch in previous discussions
[2015-03-30 16:22:08] jleyba: Would probably be very reliable. Performance on the other hand...
[2015-03-30 16:22:09] barancev: but
[2015-03-30 16:22:18] barancev: it is behavior change
[2015-03-30 16:22:33] jleyba: w/e. Selenium 3.0 is never shipping
[2015-03-30 16:22:40] lukeis: center of element? corners of element? (what if partially visible?) :)
[2015-03-30 16:23:03] lukeis: jleyba: i thought you were releasing in a couple days ;)
[2015-03-30 16:23:21] jleyba: lukeis: i have no idea how grid works so am blocked on the server parts
[2015-03-30 16:23:30] jleyba: if we ditch grid, i'll have a release ready in 3 hours :)
[2015-03-30 16:23:43] barancev: I doubt we can make hit-test based implementation backward compatible
[2015-03-30 16:23:59] jleyba: lukeis, hit test would have to traverse quad-tree of bounding box until a hit was found
[2015-03-30 16:24:34] jimevans: if v3 is "rc moved to a separate download" (No More RC!), the .NET bindings have no substantial changes to be made other than version resources.
[2015-03-30 16:24:55] jleyba: jimevans, v3 is completely blocked on pulling RC out of the standalone server
[2015-03-30 16:24:59] barancev: java binding is ready to drop RC
[2015-03-30 16:25:09] jleyba: or rather, pulling webdriver and grid out of the RC server
[2015-03-30 16:25:21] barancev: yes, server...
[2015-03-30 16:25:38] jimevans: jleyba: no argument. i'm just pointing out that for anything other than the java server case, v3 is nearly free of new content.
[2015-03-30 16:26:13] jleyba: completely random, but after v3 hits, i'm very tempted to rip the promise manager out of webdriverjs
[2015-03-30 16:26:20] jleyba: tell people it's js and async and to deal with it
[2015-03-30 16:27:35] jleyba: but enough pontificating for me
