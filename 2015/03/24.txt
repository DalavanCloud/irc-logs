[2015-03-24 07:45:02] jimevans: AnConio: well, the canonical page object model represents the page as a service that is provided by the application.
[2015-03-24 07:45:12] jimevans: in our last conversation, you posited a login page.
[2015-03-24 07:46:03] AnConio: true
[2015-03-24 07:46:09] jimevans: in a "pure" page object model implementation, the page object would provide a login() method and other methods for unsuccessful login, like, say attemptUnsuccessfulLogin()
[2015-03-24 07:46:19] AnConio: right
[2015-03-24 07:46:26] jimevans: which would allow one to test the login failure cases
[2015-03-24 07:46:27] AnConio: functionality employed by the user
[2015-03-24 07:46:57] jimevans: and would obviate the need for directly exposing individual controls on the page to the test code, as a page wrapper does.

[2015-03-24 07:47:33] AnConio: ...okay
[2015-03-24 07:48:01] AnConio: if you're trying to login w/o a password for example...
[2015-03-24 07:48:22] jimevans: then the attemptUnsuccessfulLogin() method should handle that case.

[2015-03-24 07:49:13] AnConio: I see....so you're saying there really shouldn't be a need to publicly expose the individual page controls
[2015-03-24 07:49:31] jimevans: but the implementation detail on the page of "i have a password field on the page, so i have to type into it" wouldn't necessarily be exposed to the consumer of the API

[2015-03-24 07:49:45] AnConio: right...yes I see what you mean
[2015-03-24 07:50:00] AnConio: I'm not sure if you are familiar with John Sonmez?
[2015-03-24 07:50:00] jimevans: i'm saying in a "pure" page object implementation, no, individual controls *aren't* exposed to the user.
[2015-03-24 07:50:17] jimevans: but people have misunderstood the page object model
[2015-03-24 07:50:28] jimevans: and i'm enough of a pedant to want names to *mean* something.
[2015-03-24 07:50:41] jimevans: i know john. we've corresponded a bit.
[2015-03-24 07:51:10] AnConio: i came across his PluralSight videos, well 2 of them on automated testing
[2015-03-24 07:51:24] jimevans: by "know," i mean, "know by reputation." we've never actually met face-to-face. :)
[2015-03-24 07:51:38] AnConio: and he advocated something similar, if not identical, w/o necessarily calling it, or not, a page wrapper model
[2015-03-24 07:51:45] sohlemac: My POMs usually have more granular service methods to them. I would probably have an attemptLoginWithInvalidCreds() as well as an attemptLoginWithMissingPassword()
[2015-03-24 07:52:19] AnConio: not that I'm touting him as a champion...but truly...seeing him doing it in action sort of put it all together for me...and even though I'd already read about the POM...it just sort of clicked
[2015-03-24 07:52:48] jimevans: sohlemac: that's certainly a valid approach too.
[2015-03-24 07:53:01] AnConio: sohlemac, right....but those UI elements are never "known" by the tests
[2015-03-24 07:53:09] AnConio: only by the Page
[2015-03-24 07:53:59] sohlemac: AnConio: Yes, that is the case.
[2015-03-24 07:54:02] AnConio: a lot of the examples I see on the web as I continue to wrestle with this..including in some books I've accessed on Safari...have the tests dictating and aware of the internals of Page they are driving
[2015-03-24 07:54:57] jimevans: AnConio: yep. this is exactly the situation i was describing when people say they're advocating page objects, when in reality, they're advocating page wrappers.
[2015-03-24 07:55:06] AnConio: well it's comforting to know that my approach falls more in line with a POM approach
[2015-03-24 07:55:42] sohlemac: Well, it's all about which model you choose to implement. I like the stricter POM because it makes my tests easier to read and it encapsulates the page functionality so I only have one place to change it when the page I'm testing changes.
[2015-03-24 07:56:20] sohlemac: If the tests are aware of elements, then they are each, individually, subject to impact analysis when the page changes.
[2015-03-24 07:56:39] AnConio: at some point in this exercise I am hoping to take my basic tests and then swap out Selenium for WebAii...and just refactor the Page objects themselves...that would be a good measure, I think, of just how encapsulated my pages are in my POMs
[2015-03-24 07:56:45] jimevans: i'm not saying that a page wrapper isn't appropriate in some cases. if that's what one wants to implement, go for it, but i believe one should call it what it is.
[2015-03-24 07:57:20] jimevans: AnConio: any particular reason you want to swap engines? i'm curious.
[2015-03-24 07:57:34] AnConio: I see, so you think people are just misstating what they are doing?
[2015-03-24 07:58:24] AnConio: hmn, mostly for curiosity I think...but for 3 years here I was told we had to go the WebAii way...and really I think it was mostly 'cause the devs here wanted to use Telerik Test Studio...and this is a Telerik-heavy shop
[2015-03-24 07:58:26] jimevans: AnConio: usually, yes. and the misstatement comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of the page object model.
[2015-03-24 07:59:11] AnConio: something tells me that certain things will be easier in WebAiii...so I want to "prove" it...mind you that I think Telerik's "framework" support sucks
[2015-03-24 07:59:43] AnConio: I've always gotten the feeling that they just want you to use their recorder product, Test Studio
[2015-03-24 07:59:45] sugaku, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-24 07:59:53] jimevans: AnConio: i know some of the telerik folks, more than a little. they don't produce *bad* products really. i think their marketing people are a little overzealous.
[2015-03-24 08:00:07] AnConio: they don't even mention Page Object model anywhere and always tout TTS
[2015-03-24 08:00:18] AnConio: agreed!!
[2015-03-24 08:00:34] jimevans: i'm a *huge* fan of fiddler.
[2015-03-24 08:00:45] AnConio: sure, but fiddler was around before
[2015-03-24 08:00:48] sohlemac: +1 for fiddler!
[2015-03-24 08:00:50] jimevans: but then ericlaw and i have gotten to know each other a little too. :)
[2015-03-24 08:01:14] AnConio: i still have a hard time associating Fiddler w/ Telerik
[2015-03-24 08:02:45] AnConio: they've been pushing me to use Test Studio...whenever I post something on their forums...I guess not realizing that I already have Test Studio and am choosing NOT to use it or not to go that route
[2015-03-24 08:03:26] AnConio: but I'm still curious about WebAii though...and to get technical support there you have to buy an extra license

[2015-03-24 08:07:53] AnConio: is that the typical approach...one loop for finding the elements' locators
[2015-03-24 08:08:09] AnConio: and another for setting them and using them?
[2015-03-24 08:11:14] jimevans: sort of.

[2015-03-24 08:12:17] jimevans: the problem is that you can't find all of the elements on a page, then use a loop to click on one, navigate to a different page, and go back to the previous page and click on the next one.
[2015-03-24 08:13:02] adamgoucher, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-24 08:13:21] AnConio: right, I've found that out
[2015-03-24 08:13:25] AnConio: those references are lost
[2015-03-24 08:13:32] jimevans: the second you navigate to a new page, all element references on the preceding page are stale.
[2015-03-24 08:14:09] AnConio: right...so you have to keep "re-finding" them or resetting them
[2015-03-24 08:14:14] jimevans: yes.

[2015-03-24 08:15:03] jimevans: needing to loop through a list of links and click on each one is usually an antipattern
[2015-03-24 08:15:21] AnConio: oh
[2015-03-24 08:15:40] epteixeira, quitting. (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[2015-03-24 08:15:45] jimevans: the use case for that is usually "i need to verify all of the links are valid"
[2015-03-24 08:15:50] jimevans: and there are better ways for that.
[2015-03-24 08:16:02] jimevans: if "link validity" is all you're after.
[2015-03-24 08:16:15] jimevans: or more correctly "links don't 404"
[2015-03-24 08:17:09] jimevans: especially if they're actually <a> elements, and not funky javascript widget things where your javascript framework is working against what the browser is actually designed to do.
[2015-03-24 08:17:38] *jimevans realizes he's awfully opinionated today'
[2015-03-24 08:17:54] AnConio: I was envisioning a test...light and fast...that could be run always...where you just go through the menu and click on every item...just make sure the title of the page is not "an error" and that's it....very smokey and shallow...no page object instantiation or nothing heavy like that
[2015-03-24 08:19:17] ato: Aaaaaaarrgh.
[2015-03-24 08:19:30] jimevans: again, if the menu items are actually links that rely on browser behavior (like <a> elements), an easier way is grab the target URL from the link, and use an HTTP client library to individually call each URL, and make sure you get a 200 response back.
[2015-03-24 08:20:05] jimevans: but alas, most widget libraries aren't test-friendly that way, so you need to do what you can, i suppose.
[2015-03-24 08:20:08] AnConio: but also...you know how loading a page for the 1st time after a new build usually takes longer than any other time
[2015-03-24 08:20:27] jimevans: !m ato

[2015-03-24 08:21:02] jimevans: i was just going to say that frustration sounds mercurial-related.
[2015-03-24 08:21:19] ato: I just managed to corrupt my entire repo.
[2015-03-24 08:21:25] jimevans: could even be that mercurial is being somewhat…
[2015-03-24 08:21:26] ato: Well not I, hg graft did.

[2015-03-24 08:23:38] jimevans: and i say this as a hardcore believer in UI-based end-to-end testing.

[2015-03-24 08:27:26] jimevans: unit and integration tests give you far better bang for your testing buck; are generally faster to run; have far fewer dependencies; and have fewer places where things can go wrong, causing you to chase down false positives.

[2015-03-24 08:28:57] dude-x: at LinkedIn, they use CasperJS and ghostdriver and an engine to create static html pages to test their website
[2015-03-24 08:29:15] dude-x: it helps minimizes flaky tests
[2015-03-24 08:29:25] AnConio: true, I agree w/ that...and I'm not planning on writing lots and lots of UI tests...but here, devs don't seem to place much importance on unit tests
[2015-03-24 08:29:31] AnConio: "whose got the time" they say
[2015-03-24 08:29:49] dude-x: they will pay the price in a couple of years
[2015-03-24 08:29:55] dude-x: or sooner
[2015-03-24 08:29:57] jimevans: furthermore, i'll go out on a limb and say that when you *do* test via the browser, you should be testing as little as possible *in* the browser. that means don't use the login pages unless you're *actually* testing login. don't use the UI to create a new entity, unless you're testing the UI of creating that entity.

[2015-03-24 08:32:06] AnConio: interesting...so by that token, you do advocate using URL-based navigation? that's something I've been straying away from since I wanted to keep my tests as "user authentic" as possible
[2015-03-24 08:32:54] dude-x: just depends on what tradeoffs do you want to make
[2015-03-24 08:33:02] AnConio: wow, money lost eh? this isn't that critical here so I doubt it'll ever come to that

[2015-03-24 12:50:54] DarkElement: The names do not differ between the buttons
[2015-03-24 12:51:02] DarkElement: Is this a correct Xpath? .//html/body/div[3]/div[3]/div/div/form/div/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div/label[1]

[2015-03-24 15:00:57] dude-x: what's the goal of selenium 4
[2015-03-24 15:00:58] ato: dude-x: Instead it's likely it will be moved to UA specific extensions.
[2015-03-24 15:01:17] ato: dude-x: Main goal of Selenium 4 is W3C WebDriver compatibility.
[2015-03-24 15:01:22] AutomatedTester: dude-x: hopefully alignment with W3C
[2015-03-24 15:01:32] ato: Yeah, hopefully is the right word.
[2015-03-24 15:01:35] lukeis: AutomatedTester: so…. not going to chime in on that issue? ;)
[2015-03-24 15:01:37] dude-x: ah like it's a final standard, while 3 is just clean up
[2015-03-24 15:01:44] ato: There's a big caveat that we finish the spec in time.
[2015-03-24 15:01:47] AutomatedTester: lukeis: thinking about it
[2015-03-24 15:01:58] ato: dude-x: Yes, exactly.
[2015-03-24 15:02:17] lukeis: AutomatedTester: given I provided the sample code (which is very small btw) to be able to do it themselves...
[2015-03-24 15:02:18] AutomatedTester: lukeis: the spec allows for people to set their own sessionID
[2015-03-24 15:02:38] ato: lukeis, AutomatedTester: Current driver practice on that is a bit spotty.
[2015-03-24 15:03:03] AutomatedTester: ato: someone raised a bug suggesting we add it to the python code
[2015-03-24 15:03:28] AutomatedTester: lukeis: there has been a discussion in my team to remove that ability
[2015-03-24 15:03:28] ato: I saw that.  It will only work on some drivers AFAICT.
[2015-03-24 15:03:45] AutomatedTester: lukeis: but we havent externalised it
[2015-03-24 15:03:51] lukeis: remove what ability?
[2015-03-24 15:03:58] lukeis: specify an session id?
[2015-03-24 15:04:02] AutomatedTester: yes
[2015-03-24 15:04:05] lukeis: before it's created...
[2015-03-24 15:04:13] lukeis: that seems like something that should be axed

[2015-03-24 15:05:46] ato: So the argument for is the ability to transparently reuse an existing session through intermediaries.
[2015-03-24 15:05:57] ato: As far as I understand it.
[2015-03-24 15:06:14] AutomatedTester: yes, and we have a mozilla specific use case
[2015-03-24 15:06:29] ato: But since there's no origin checking of HTTP requests, you could just fake the session ID in the next command request anyways.
[2015-03-24 15:07:33] ato: But I can't say I fully understand the use case.

[2015-03-24 15:15:07] AutomatedTester: Google open source a build tool
[2015-03-24 15:15:13] AutomatedTester: can we use that instead of buck?
[2015-03-24 15:15:20] lukeis: they misspelled blaze ;)
[2015-03-24 15:16:26] lukeis: AutomatedTester: neither bazel nor buck work on windows :-D

[2015-03-24 15:20:06] lukeis: bah-zehl :)
[2015-03-24 15:20:30] lukeis: not bay-zel  ;)
[2015-03-24 15:20:35] juangj: last i heard there was still plenty of debate within the team between those two options
[2015-03-24 15:20:55] lukeis: i read it immediately as bah-zel
[2015-03-24 15:21:07] juangj: i guess they wanted to preserve the vowel sound from 'blaze'
[2015-03-24 15:21:21] juangj: i'm not saying that's a good reason or that they're right
[2015-03-24 15:22:24] lukeis: "Until now, Bazel was not available externally, so open source projects such as Chromium, Android, etc. could not use it. In addition, lack of Windows support is a problem for building Windows applications, such as Chrome."
[2015-03-24 15:22:44] lukeis: chrome's built with 'ninja' right?
[2015-03-24 15:22:52] DarkElement: So would the driver for google be webdriver.ChromeDriver()?
[2015-03-24 15:23:16] lukeis: if you're talking python… it's just webdriver.Chrome()
