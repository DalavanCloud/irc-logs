[2015-03-19 05:10:37] usrenmae, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-19 05:15:03] usrenmae: Hello. Is there any way I can atomically fetch value of the attribute for a particular element? Currently once I do find_element().get_attribute(x), there are two requests to selenium server are done: first selects the element, the second retrieves the attribute for the element. But in between those two requests the element itself can easily vanish or be replaced by another similar one in the page with loads of js magic. Is there any way to a
[2015-03-19 05:22:37] sircapsalot: that doesnt seem right..  it shouldn't do two requests, since you are calling get_attribute(x) of an object.  get_attribute(x) shouldn't query the dom anymore.. it should interact on the object you found
[2015-03-19 05:23:59] gabel, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-19 05:25:41] ato: barancev: Maybe I'll have time to look tonight.
[2015-03-19 05:26:25] ato: usrenmae: executeScript("document.querySelector(…).getAttribute(x)")
[2015-03-19 05:28:34] WhereIsMySpoon: if you call get_attribute on find_element it doesnt matter if the dom changes
[2015-03-19 05:28:43] WhereIsMySpoon: find_element will return the webelement at the time of finding
[2015-03-19 05:28:51] WhereIsMySpoon: when you call get_attribute it wont reload the element
[2015-03-19 05:29:08] WhereIsMySpoon: afaik
[2015-03-19 05:29:47] sircapsalot: exactly what i thought
[2015-03-19 05:29:52] sircapsalot: it almost sounds like it's querying dom again?
[2015-03-19 05:30:09] davehunt, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2015-03-19 05:30:24] sircapsalot: or maybe all that data isn't stored in the object...
[2015-03-19 05:31:14] WhereIsMySpoon: usrenmae: why do you think there are 2 dom queries?
[2015-03-19 05:34:22] ato: findElement(s).getAttribute(a) will perform two calls across the wire.  The first returns a web element reference, the second passes that reference as part of the second call to get its attribute.  The driver then looks up that element in a list of known elements before it runs the getAttribute atom on it.
[2015-03-19 05:35:08] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2015-03-19 05:36:43] ato: So to summarise: The getAttribute atom runs against the element in the DOM, not a copied/cached instance of the element.
[2015-03-19 05:37:18] ato: Think of the WebElement interface in OO languages as a proxy.
[2015-03-19 05:38:44] sircapsalot: was this by design?  i could see why it'd be effective for optimization, but it seems that it might be counter-intuitive, considering if the attributes change, it throws a StaleReferenceException anyway..
[2015-03-19 05:39:03] usrenmae: this is indeed what I mean. So if your element is dynamic enough, and may change/recreate as whole between the two requests you will need to re-request both requests again.
[2015-03-19 05:41:28] usrenmae: I am having a bunch of such inconsistencies during remote testing with saucelabs.com which is slow enough. Hundreds of milliseconds between requests is just enough for a remote browser to change the state, so I need to re-request again.
[2015-03-19 05:41:52] sircapsalot: you should try what ato recommended.  `executescript1`
[2015-03-19 05:42:53] ato: sircapsalot: Are you referring to a DOM attribute or Selenium's special conflation of attributes and properties?  And why would a changing property invalidate a web element reference?
[2015-03-19 05:43:12] usrenmae: @sircapsalot, yes, you are right. but this will need to be done all over the place in my tests, so it makes generic selenium libraries be not much of a help. I thought there might be some more comfortable tricks for such a common case.
[2015-03-19 05:43:55] sircapsalot: you could always wrap it usrenmae.  make your own get_attribute(element, attribute) method to do it
[2015-03-19 05:43:58] ato: usrenmae: I'm not sure I understand, but if you look up an element by a property on it that changes, getAttribute on the element object should work just fine still because the driver retrieves the DOM object from an internal cache.

[2015-03-19 05:45:32] WhereIsMySpoon: not the attribute
[2015-03-19 05:45:38] usrenmae: @ato, I get StaleReferenceException
[2015-03-19 05:45:47] ato: OK
[2015-03-19 05:46:35] ato: There's no way to define an atomic action over multiple commands because the web platform doesn't work that way.
[2015-03-19 05:47:09] ato: You could clone the section of the DOM you care about and run your code against that, but using executeScript here seems like the best option.
[2015-03-19 05:48:45] usrenmae: @ato, all the things are affected, as I understand: find_element().click() find_element().is_displayed()/enabled , etc. Right?
[2015-03-19 05:51:35] usrenmae: If there were a possibility to run queries in batches atomically, sending multiple of those to server. but this is already a different animal rather then current selenium implementation.
[2015-03-19 05:53:26] usrenmae: Most probably the same problem exists even if you run jquery in browser, like $('#comeandgoelement').click(), but the delay is tiny enough so in most cases it's not an issue.

[2015-03-19 11:31:53] Nisha_: Chrome seems more comfortable
[2015-03-19 11:32:19] Nisha_: In finding elements and running tests..... its fast and easy
[2015-03-19 11:32:35] Nisha_: My boyfriend was also saying like this....
[2015-03-19 11:32:47] sircapsalot: honestly - i only really deal with chrome.  i've experienced difficulties in IE before when i had a windows machine, but that was only with xpath selectors.
[2015-03-19 11:33:00] sircapsalot: which have since been fixed
[2015-03-19 11:33:00] Conio: Titus, interesting...so Webdriver 2.44 is only OFFICIALLY compatible up to FF 33? I'm using 2.44 against FF 35 and wouldn't say it's slow going
[2015-03-19 11:33:40] Nisha_: Ok sir
[2015-03-19 11:34:04] sircapsalot: also, this is totally subjective… but you should find out what your main target browser is.  if the majority of your users are chrome users, you should focus on chrome.
[2015-03-19 11:34:24] Conio: during one of my runs, FF auto-upgraded itself to v. 36...and none of my tests would work...wouldn't even make it to the first page of the tests...quite a mess

[2015-03-19 12:09:41] Conio: just make sure every page loads...but it seems that every page that I try to load AFTER this particularly tricky page then fails

[2015-03-19 12:10:38] Conio: i've reshuffled my steps around to have PageTricky precede any other page...and sure enough...the trickyPage loads....but the page after does not
[2015-03-19 12:11:07] Conio: the error thrown is that the menu item for the nextPage was not found
[2015-03-19 12:11:53] Conio: my PageReached() method on my base class is written up such that it's looking for document.readyState = "complete"
[2015-03-19 12:12:47] Conio: and that seems to suffice for all of the other pages
[2015-03-19 12:14:35] Conio: any thoughts?

[2015-03-19 12:17:00] dude-x: does it have a lot of javascript ajax calls?
[2015-03-19 12:17:12] dude-x: Nisha__: a gentleman never tells.
[2015-03-19 12:17:40] Nisha__: Didn't you hear that?

[2015-03-19 12:17:56] swampdragons, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-19 12:18:10] Conio: no on the infinite scroll
[2015-03-19 12:18:32] Conio: but it probably is a bit more ajax intensive...but I wouldn't say a lot
[2015-03-19 12:18:45] dude-x: Conio: then most likely those "tricky" pages have a lot of javascript going on that will "block" selenium
[2015-03-19 12:18:47] dude-x: and thus fail
[2015-03-19 12:18:54] Conio: it just loads data on page load...versus making the user click a button to load data
[2015-03-19 12:19:04] dude-x: you may want to wait for specific elements to apper on that page before calling it done.
[2015-03-19 12:19:18] Conio: this trickyPage is actually one of the better ones on this program...from a UX experience
[2015-03-19 12:19:41] dude-x: Nisha__: I haven't seen Interstellar.
[2015-03-19 12:20:02] Nisha__: But you have read my line, correct?
[2015-03-19 12:20:32] Conio: I've actually already tried over riding the base page's PageReached() method and written one specifically for this tricky page
[2015-03-19 12:21:05] Conio: whereby I wait to locate a specific element unique to this trickyPage...but still no luck
[2015-03-19 12:21:22] Conio: and it's FF that is consistently failing

[2015-03-19 12:23:05] dude-x: you have to find the right element to wait on.
[2015-03-19 12:23:22] dude-x: if you use Firebug, and then the firediff plugin, you can see all the dom changes that happen
[2015-03-19 12:23:38] dude-x: look at the last thing changed, and then wait on that element to be set to that state
[2015-03-19 12:23:56] Conio: hmn, firediff eh
[2015-03-19 12:25:27] dude-x: yeah
[2015-03-19 12:25:41] dude-x: next version of FF i think will have this "dom viewer" thing that does the same thnig
[2015-03-19 12:25:45] dude-x: but for now, firediff
[2015-03-19 12:25:58] dude-x: Nisha__: i have

[2015-03-19 13:30:38] zaidi: hello folks
[2015-03-19 13:30:41] barancev: so you can ensure webdriver.stacktrace atom is compatible
[2015-03-19 13:30:52] ato: barancev: And scroll down to JavaScriptError.
[2015-03-19 13:31:02] zaidi: I am trying to make use of "Selenium Grid Node - Firefox"
[2015-03-19 13:31:06] ato: barancev: Can you link me that?
[2015-03-19 13:31:06] zaidi: in EC2
[2015-03-19 13:31:09] zaidi: has anyone done this ?
[2015-03-19 13:31:42] barancev: ato: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/webdriver/stacktrace.js
[2015-03-19 13:32:44] ato: That's quite elegant.
[2015-03-19 13:34:33] barancev: elegance is important if it is correct only :)
[2015-03-19 13:35:37] ato: My patch is a refactor only so it doesn't change the input or the output.
[2015-03-19 13:35:50] ato: But if we're doing something incompatible we can fix that, certainly.
[2015-03-19 13:36:35] ato: What comes out of Marionette currently I think is pretty useless.
[2015-03-19 13:37:18] barancev: I wonder if we can use this implementation instead of the custom one https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/firefox-driver/js/error.js#L29
[2015-03-19 13:38:16] barancev: that is short and simple but not very elegant :)
[2015-03-19 13:39:25] ato: Maybe…
[2015-03-19 13:39:44] barancev: maybe not?
[2015-03-19 13:40:12] ato: I don't really want to import a blob of code that does a lot of stuff we don't need.
[2015-03-19 13:40:41] barancev: the main fear I have is related to old firefoxes
[2015-03-19 13:41:05] barancev: stacktrace format changed 3 or 4 times in firefox

[2015-03-19 14:07:46] ato: But ATM there's no requirement to serialise the stack at all.
[2015-03-19 14:08:30] barancev: you can't even get an error message in IE, nothing said about stacktrace
[2015-03-19 14:08:58] AutomatedTester: so the best way to get that info would be to make sure it is specified somewhere
[2015-03-19 14:09:01] barancev: well, may be IE10 and 11 are better
[2015-03-19 14:09:14] AutomatedTester: MS will not care otherwise
[2015-03-19 14:09:16] ato: They won't have it unless it's in the spec.
[2015-03-19 14:10:47] AutomatedTester: the IE team are working against the spec as is, when I have specified variable names differently this has caused jimevans extra work
[2015-03-19 14:10:56] AutomatedTester: so they are working against the spec

[2015-03-19 14:42:17] Conio: can't figure it out from the documentation...although one poster claims it doesnt' work with Firebug v. 2 or 3
[2015-03-19 14:42:54] dude-x: Conio: that could be true.
[2015-03-19 14:42:55] Conio: I'm on Firebug 2.0.8
[2015-03-19 14:42:56] dude-x: let me see
[2015-03-19 14:43:38] Conio: I'm guessing it's so easy to use that it "should" be self-explanatory...especially since nobody else has said anything about "how to use it"
[2015-03-19 14:44:17] AutomatedTester: for all the Taylor Swift fans https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv94swj4sjo
[2015-03-19 14:44:41] dude-x: Conio: there should be a Changes tab in firebug

[2015-03-19 14:45:52] dude-x: i have FF 36.0.1, Firebug 2.0.8, and FireDiff 1.2.1, which is pretty old.
[2015-03-19 14:45:54] Conio: ahh! I see it!

[2015-03-19 16:32:49] niloc132: hello, i'm looking for advice on requesting any browser available from a webdriver node, regardless of name/version/platform
[2015-03-19 16:33:02] niloc132: constructing an empty DesiredCapabilities would appear to do this, but instead nothing comes back
[2015-03-19 16:40:46] niloc132: specifically, I get a "sessionId should not be null; has this session been started yet?" error if no browser is set, rather than a specific error, or any browser available

[2015-03-19 16:43:20] niloc132: yes, i have a hub with a single node attached, which has a single browser attached to it for testing purposes

[2015-03-19 16:43:48] niloc132: if i use the GhostDriver wiring in phantomjs, it is okay with no name being set, and just returns the only browser available
[2015-03-19 16:44:08] niloc132: ideally i'd like to not care what i'm connecting to or getting, this set of tests is sufficiently cross browser to not care
[2015-03-19 16:44:37] niloc132: the alternative appears to be 'poll the hub/node for what is available, then ask for what is available' instead of just asking for *any* available

[2015-03-19 16:47:48] AutomatedTester: niloc132: not sure if grid can handle that type of request but if you just spoke to the normal java endpoint and passed in a browser, it will try its best to give you what you want and then after that do some fuzzy matching
[2015-03-19 16:48:01] AutomatedTester: so you can ask for IE on linux and will be given Firefox
[2015-03-19 16:48:27] DarkRift, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-19 16:48:35] niloc132: ah - i'll admit I hadn't tried that, though I have tried asking for nonesense like "" or "*" or null as the browser name
[2015-03-19 16:48:57] niloc132: will asking for an actual browser that is not available have different results? i thought that browser names were arbitrary (configurable) strings
[2015-03-19 16:50:10] AutomatedTester: so we try encourage people to have deterministic uses of webdriver
[2015-03-19 16:50:19] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-19 16:50:26] AutomatedTester: asking for any browsers removes that determinism

[2015-03-19 16:54:39] niloc132: this being sent to a linux box with only chrome available
[2015-03-19 16:55:00] niloc132: so evidently the fuzzy matching is not as fuzzy as i'd like
[2015-03-19 16:55:38] niloc132: i in general agree with the most-specific-browser possible ideal, but (and i'm sure you hear this a lot) It Matters In My Case

[2015-03-19 21:15:48] MagnumCI: I'm a PHP developer trying to make sense of CI, and I think I have an easy question: how are you supposed to run Watir/Selenium tests against a site that's been built in a CI machine instance?
[2015-03-19 21:19:57] dude-x: say that you're using Jenkins as your CI
[2015-03-19 21:20:11] p0deje, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-19 21:20:27] dude-x: you build your site as a job, maybe it runs unit tests/integration tests (if it doesn't, then change that NOW)
[2015-03-19 21:21:32] dude-x: after the those tests are completed, then you just run selenium tests, which would mean your CI machine has a webbrowser installed and a framebuffer for the browser
[2015-03-19 21:21:40] niloc132, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-19 21:21:51] dude-x: alternatively, you can create a new job that would be linked to the first job passing
[2015-03-19 21:22:01] dude-x: that will just run selenium tests only
[2015-03-19 21:22:08] MagnumCI: I'd love to tell you that Jenkins is my CI, but I'm currently trying out Codeship and Semaphore because it's easy.
[2015-03-19 21:22:28] Neo--, quitting. (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[2015-03-19 21:22:51] MagnumCI: I think my question's dumber than the one you're answering.
[2015-03-19 21:22:54] dude-x: still any CI machine is more or less a job dispatcher
[2015-03-19 21:23:29] dude-x: if your CI builds the site
[2015-03-19 21:23:47] dude-x: then you can create another job to run tests against that built site
[2015-03-19 21:23:56] MagnumCI: Ah, right there.
[2015-03-19 21:24:11] MagnumCI: So I have that sort of working—tests run using Watir webdriver.
[2015-03-19 21:24:38] MagnumCI: Only problem is I feed the browser URLs for the public/production site, not the one built by the CI.
[2015-03-19 21:24:44] niloc132, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2015-03-19 21:25:29] dude-x: at one place i worked at, we had 5 servers, 1 to run Jenkins as the CI. When a developer pushes code to the branch, Jenkins, which is polling our code repository will then start a job to run all tests. Once all the low level tests passed, it will then build the website and deploy it to the 4 servers
[2015-03-19 21:25:33] MagnumCI: Is it the obvious thing? Figure out how to configure a vhost on the build machine, restart Apache, and then run the webdriver tests on http://localhost?
[2015-03-19 21:26:35] MagnumCI: Did you use Selenium during the later stages before deployment, or as post-deployment QA?
[2015-03-19 21:26:45] dude-x: then Jenkins will fire off another job, to start selenium tests, which would run on jenkins but communicate with the 4 webservers
[2015-03-19 21:27:07] dude-x: modify your scripts to use the CI's url
[2015-03-19 21:27:23] dude-x: in your watir/selenium tests
[2015-03-19 21:27:37] MagnumCI: That's where I'm stuck, simply *getting* the CI's URL.
[2015-03-19 21:27:57] dude-x: you should have a configuration file that lets you replace the base URL
[2015-03-19 21:28:26] dude-x: you should configure your CI machine to have a consistent name
[2015-03-19 21:29:21] MagnumCI: I think I'm following you. So the CI is always foo.dev, regardless of the project you're building/testing.
[2015-03-19 21:29:28] dude-x: yeah
[2015-03-19 21:29:39] dude-x: at my current job, i have qaa.blah.com
[2015-03-19 21:30:06] MagnumCI: Is it a given that any CI will expose running containers like that?
[2015-03-19 21:30:08] dude-x: but our tests have a config file any one can modify to point to other test servers
[2015-03-19 21:30:32] dude-x: expose what?
[2015-03-19 21:30:56] MagnumCI: Maybe I'm misunderstanding. (And thanks for helping me here!)
[2015-03-19 21:31:14] MagnumCI: Is your qaa.blah.com pointing to a CI-built app instance used for testing, before deployment?
[2015-03-19 21:31:23] dude-x: well...

[2015-03-19 21:31:50] dude-x: where i work now, we don't build working software because of the way it's architected
[2015-03-19 21:31:57] dude-x: at a prior job we did
[2015-03-19 21:32:05] dude-x: the CI server would run tests
[2015-03-19 21:32:14] dude-x: then when all the unit/integration tests passed
[2015-03-19 21:32:39] niloc132, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2015-03-19 21:32:42] dude-x: it would then build the software into a RPM that it would deploy to a separate box
[2015-03-19 21:33:04] dude-x: the reason is that we just want the CI box to just run tests, and not actually run the webserver itself
[2015-03-19 21:33:43] MagnumCI: Ah okay. So a CI server can be different things to different people, depending on what they build and how they test+deploy it.
[2015-03-19 21:33:47] dude-x: yes
[2015-03-19 21:34:15] MagnumCI: Pretend now that you're a humble, solo PHP developer with a graphic design background, who aspires to greatness.
[2015-03-19 21:34:52] dude-x: at my current job, our CI server simply runs unit and integration tests against the code itself, and it has a database running for some of the tests.
[2015-03-19 21:35:20] dude-x: If these tests pass, then it's safe to assume that we can deploy that code change to the QA nodes
[2015-03-19 21:35:22] MagnumCI: You write some framework-based apps (CodeIgniter, Laravel, etc.), but mainly you want to test sites built on CMS products before you deploy them.
[2015-03-19 21:36:22] dude-x: CI servers are just job dispatchers. It's up to you to figure out, what kind of things do you want to run. Do you want to run tests. Do you want to build your software
[2015-03-19 21:36:22] MagnumCI: I'm used to working on sites locally and git-deploying them via SSH to some single-instance production environment.
[2015-03-19 21:36:38] dude-x: that's pretty common
[2015-03-19 21:36:50] dude-x: our deploy scripts at my current job or pretty much that
[2015-03-19 21:36:54] dude-x:  s/or/are
[2015-03-19 21:37:22] dude-x: at a prior job, because we used CentOS servers everywhere
[2015-03-19 21:37:38] dude-x: we could actually package them as RPMs for easy deployment to any CentOS server
[2015-03-19 21:38:00] MagnumCI: I don't know ruby, but I've managed to write perfectly good tests with Watir and I'm now trying to run them on sites available in CI containers.
[2015-03-19 21:38:03] dude-x: but we had a team of developers who wrote really nice automation scripts with lots of checking to make sure this process is smooth
[2015-03-19 21:38:17] MagnumCI: You've done real team-based software development that's miles ahead of what I'm attempting to work out now.
[2015-03-19 21:38:35] MagnumCI: (Which sounds fun, honestly, but I'm just not operating at that level.)
[2015-03-19 21:38:42] dude-x: as a single developer, you have control of your CI box
[2015-03-19 21:38:55] dude-x: whatever you need to to make it run tests on the CI box
[2015-03-19 21:39:03] dude-x: is whatever you need to do to make it run
[2015-03-19 21:39:14] dude-x: so if you have production URLs in your tests
[2015-03-19 21:39:24] dude-x: rewrite your tests to make URLs configurable
[2015-03-19 21:39:25] MagnumCI: That's a side quest; I'm trying CI services because they're available and free/cheap, but I'm contemplating buying a small PC to run Jenkins.
[2015-03-19 21:40:00] MagnumCI: I can do that, I'm just stuck on making the temporary CI-built server instance available at a URL to be tested against.
[2015-03-19 21:40:17] MagnumCI: It's the one thing I've found zero real-world examples of on the interwebs.
[2015-03-19 21:40:34] dude-x: you can choose to deploy on the CI server, or deploy to another server

[2015-03-19 21:41:07] MagnumCI: Good point. That explains why some of the CI services I've tried are so wildly open-ended.
[2015-03-19 21:41:10] dude-x: when you have a team of people, you will need to have lots of servers since a big project will have lots of tests running all the time
[2015-03-19 21:41:32] dude-x: Yes, CI machines, when stripped of the bells and whistles are just fancy job dispatchers
[2015-03-19 21:41:39] MagnumCI: I figured out that's why "Parallel CI" is touted as a feature, and of course gets more expensive as you go.
[2015-03-19 21:41:52] dude-x: or scripts that execute on schedule or a trigger
[2015-03-19 21:43:27] MagnumCI: So as far as my problem goes, it sounds like if you were me and had a perfectly good Ubuntu container running with your app, you'd just figure out how to manipulate the deployment to have a vhost serving your app, then set up your tests scripts to test against that URL/localhost.

[2015-03-19 21:44:00] dude-x: yes
[2015-03-19 21:44:13] MagnumCI: lol
[2015-03-19 21:44:21] dude-x: you want to be able to have a secure test server
[2015-03-19 21:44:31] MagnumCI: So I figure it out, I'm just a bit of hacking away and kind of timid about it.
[2015-03-19 21:44:38] MagnumCI: figured*
[2015-03-19 21:45:19] MagnumCI: That's what I like about the two services I'm trying: the CI spins up an AWS machine and drops your app in it. When the tests are all done, poof! it's gone.
[2015-03-19 21:45:49] MagnumCI: The test setup/deploy is almost brainless, and finite.
[2015-03-19 21:46:27] MagnumCI: Thanks for helping me through all this. What kind of software have/do you work on?

[2015-03-19 21:51:42] dude-x: i worked on a pure web app that was written in Java/Spring so selenium tests were vital

[2015-03-19 21:52:19] dude-x: i curently work on a distributed messaging system that has some UI stuff but mostly a REST API and task/server service layer
[2015-03-19 21:52:30] dude-x: stuff so that's a bit more challenging to test
[2015-03-19 21:52:41] dude-x: anyway time for me to sleep
[2015-03-19 21:53:00] MagnumCI: Well thanks for your time and comments.
