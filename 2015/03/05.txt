[2015-03-05 08:40:20] ericmeds: theyre good as an out of the box solution
[2015-03-05 08:40:20] LocusAsaf: I'd like to to just use the selenium library and then use pytest as a test runner
[2015-03-05 08:40:32] ericmeds: yeah
[2015-03-05 08:40:34] ericmeds: that’s all
[2015-03-05 08:40:50] ericmeds: write a wrapper for selenium, use page objects, common functions, and py.test to run it all
[2015-03-05 08:41:25] LocusAsaf: dude-x: it is agnostic to python & java because it uses its own keyword syntax

[2015-03-05 08:42:09] LocusAsaf: ericmeds: do you know of any nice way to leveraging the use of different browsers with built in selenium from python, from my experience it only comes with the firefox driver pre-loaded, is that right?
[2015-03-05 08:42:27] ericmeds: yeah but you just need to download the chrome/safari drivers
[2015-03-05 08:42:28] ericmeds: etc
[2015-03-05 08:42:31] ericmeds: and put it in your path
[2015-03-05 08:43:02] ericmeds: they’re maintained separately
[2015-03-05 08:43:11] knownasilya, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-05 08:43:16] LocusAsaf: that's the kind of thing I'm trying to explain as well
[2015-03-05 08:43:25] LocusAsaf: I think SST comes with the drivers loaded when you install it from pypi
[2015-03-05 08:44:30] LocusAsaf: I'm sure I can create a script that downloads the drivers & puts them in the path but I'm trying to determine if there is a marginal benefit to writing that script and some other overhead stuff if SST will be just as good out of the box?
[2015-03-05 08:44:33] LocusAsaf: does that make sense
[2015-03-05 08:46:25] Dave_B_: the SST framework description sounds like it's python webdriver + py.test or nosetest or similar
[2015-03-05 08:46:49] Dave_B_: think I'd need to investigate a bit to see what advantages it gives
[2015-03-05 08:47:28] LocusAsaf: Dave_B_: thats essentially correct
[2015-03-05 08:47:38] LocusAsaf: the documentation is pretty barebones thats one thing I don't like about it
[2015-03-05 08:48:11] Dave_B_: could be a mixed blessing I guess, gives useful seatures but doesn't tell you about it :p
[2015-03-05 08:48:18] Dave_B_: *features
[2015-03-05 08:48:38] LocusAsaf: but it seems to have all the major browsers built in & has pyvirtual display built in for headless testing
[2015-03-05 08:50:04] LocusAsaf: which appears to be nice since I've had to roll my own before as well
[2015-03-05 08:50:07] Dave_B_: looking at https://answers.launchpad.net/selenium-simple-test/+question/230091 I suspect it is the same in terms of fetching the drivers yourself, though I could be mistaken
[2015-03-05 08:50:26] Dave_B_: may be out of date and/or wrong tho
[2015-03-05 08:50:37] LocusAsaf: ah yes I see
[2015-03-05 08:51:22] Dave_B_: coming with xvfb support out of the box may be nice, saves a wee bit of effort

[2015-03-05 08:51:49] LocusAsaf: yeah
[2015-03-05 08:51:53] *Dave_B_ tends to go for very little in the way of tooling but don't take that to mean you should too'
[2015-03-05 08:52:10] LocusAsaf: meaning you just write the damn tests?
[2015-03-05 08:52:15] michl68, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-05 08:52:43] Dave_B_: ehh, well basically yeah though i do create page object models to better manage keeping locators etc up to date
[2015-03-05 08:53:14] LocusAsaf: that sounds interesting can you give me an example?
[2015-03-05 08:53:53] LocusAsaf: FYI to current listener, I'll be posting the same questions a bit later today just to see if I can get other peoples opinions
[2015-03-05 08:54:10] Dave_B_: :) always good to get a range of opinions
[2015-03-05 08:54:22] LocusAsaf: indeed
[2015-03-05 08:54:24] Dave_B_: I'll try to sanitise some code snippets to show you what i mean

[2015-03-05 09:01:36] *jimevans is going to look at a new place tomorrow'
[2015-03-05 09:01:52] Dave_B_: LocusAsaf: I actually use some inheritance so the pages are not just objects, and the elements are lazily evaluated properties etc, but the general pattern is like that. I'm also moving from nosetest to py.test atm
[2015-03-05 09:01:56] simonstewart: Into The Girlfriend's place rather than my New Flat, but it's moving
[2015-03-05 09:02:03] simonstewart: jimevans: you're moving?
[2015-03-05 09:02:11] simonstewart: Still in the same city, right?

[2015-03-05 09:02:56] LocusAsaf: Dave_B_: btw, I think pytest is significantly better than nose from my experience

[2015-03-05 09:10:29] WhereIsMySpoon: there's very little robot can do that selenium cant unless you want to be interacting with system level elements which means you're going outside the realm of website testing

[2015-03-05 13:21:00] malaverdiere: Hi ppl. I want to use phantomjs for selenium but without a grid - how do I do that?
[2015-03-05 13:21:35] jimevans: although i caution you the microsoft implementation (VENDOR) is not ready for prime time. i would strongly discourage you from using it.
[2015-03-05 13:22:09] jimevans: malaverdiere: just use the PhantomJSDriver class?
[2015-03-05 13:23:06] trevorj: AutomatedTester: It appears the only way to set proxy authentication with Firefox is to create a FirefoxProfile object with a pre-warmed firefox profile.
[2015-03-05 13:23:24] trevorj: We've run into decryption errors sometimes, which doesn't make sense that it would only occur sometimes
[2015-03-05 13:23:33] trevorj: Sine the profile is checked into our codebase
[2015-03-05 13:24:41] tanG: so LEGACY will use the default driver implementation and you need these modes only when you are using the vendor like MS to make sure one you want is picked up otherwise it will default and you do not need to use any mode?
[2015-03-05 13:24:52] jimevans: tanG: correct.
[2015-03-05 13:25:02] tanG: sounds good
[2015-03-05 13:25:31] trevorj: The first issue with this is we're using a remote cluster and sending a 7M + 33% base64 encoding overhead per session
[2015-03-05 13:25:32] tanG: Thanks a lot
[2015-03-05 13:26:05] jimevans: tanG: np

[2015-03-05 13:33:08] lukeis: barancev: cause it is? … unless it's a platform bug with chrome
[2015-03-05 13:33:20] jimevans: malaverdiere: sorry, i'm pretty sure you'll be out of luck on that one.

[2015-03-05 13:33:32] malaverdiere: jimevans: meaning?
[2015-03-05 13:33:42] trevorj: AutomatedTester: either way we do it it's always showing the basic auth dialog for proxy auth
[2015-03-05 13:33:52] trevorj: AutomatedTester: So even when decryption does succeed, we have to press OK
[2015-03-05 13:34:40] jimevans: malaverdiere: well, hang on. i'll recuse my self from the conversation. i abhor selenium RC with the passion of a thousand suns, and believe record-playback to be an evolutionary dead end for test development, so i'm not going to be the right person to engage about your questions.

[2015-03-05 13:36:48] barancev: the option is missing from the dropdown

[2015-03-05 13:37:24] barancev: how could I forget
[2015-03-05 13:37:51] AutomatedTester: trevorj: you would need to use profiles with firefox, there is no way to get around that since the proxy details are per profile
[2015-03-05 13:37:53] barancev: there are browsers, and there are OSes
[2015-03-05 13:38:00] trevorj: AutomatedTester: That's what we've been doing
[2015-03-05 13:38:20] AutomatedTester: and sometimes it doesnt load the proxy?
[2015-03-05 13:38:33] AutomatedTester: is the proxy supposed to get around the basic auth?
[2015-03-05 13:38:51] trevorj: AutomatedTester: It's supposed to not ask for us to press OK on the basic auth dialog
[2015-03-05 13:38:57] trevorj: AutomatedTester: But it does -- twice, then it works
[2015-03-05 13:39:05] cristi, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-05 13:39:23] trevorj: AutomatedTester: It asks twice because it's making two requests -- one to a mozilla.org site, another to the site we're trying to access.
[2015-03-05 13:39:55] AutomatedTester: is the proxy in the docker image?
[2015-03-05 13:40:05] AutomatedTester: or is it else where and constantly running
[2015-03-05 13:40:16] trevorj: Elsewhere and constantly running

[2015-03-05 13:45:51] AutomatedTester: trevorj: I can't see anything obvious. I can only think somehow you're hitting a race condition
[2015-03-05 13:46:30] AutomatedTester: trevorj: what happens when you don't pass in your path to a profile and make one programmatically
[2015-03-05 13:49:22] trevorj: AutomatedTester: If we don't use a profile it asks us for proxy auth parameters
