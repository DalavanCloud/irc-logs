[2015-03-04 07:43:39] Cono_: Is it possible to use both annotated declaration of webelements for instantiation via the PageFactory AND explicit waits?
[2015-03-04 07:45:11] Cono_: I'm having problems with my tests running on IE10.  Firefox 35 works fine so I think I have to use explicit waits to force IE to behave and wait correctly every time I go to a different page
[2015-03-04 07:46:11] WhereIsMySpoon: Cono_: I found issues when using annotated declaration of webelements in explicit waits tbh
[2015-03-04 07:46:29] WhereIsMySpoon: i converted most of them to private final Bys
[2015-03-04 07:46:50] Cono_: I see. Thank you. What kinds of issues?

[2015-03-04 07:47:11] Cono_: ah! maybe that's what I'm seeing
[2015-03-04 07:47:46] Cono_: again FF runs smoothly but now even Chrome is not working correctly..which is odd b/c about 2 days ago the tests ran fine in Chrome as well
[2015-03-04 07:49:10] swampdragons, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-04 07:50:04] WhereIsMySpoon: i found that for pages that were very well designed and were not heavy on js/ajax usage and such that the annotated webelements worked well
[2015-03-04 07:50:41] Cono_: okay, well I'd say these pages...and certainly this app is not heavy on ajax usage
[2015-03-04 07:51:00] Cono_: it's an old, ca. 2004 asp.net app
[2015-03-04 07:51:39] Cono_: used mostly, they claim, via IE so it's imperative to get the tests to work with IE, pita as it may be
[2015-03-04 07:53:26] rananda, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-04 07:53:27] WhereIsMySpoon: Cono_: i sympathise with you
[2015-03-04 07:53:46] WhereIsMySpoon: Cono_: ie8 at least? or 6?
[2015-03-04 07:54:29] Cono_: no, we're at IE 10 now
[2015-03-04 07:54:50] Cono_: actually some users report using IE 11 so it's not quite that bad
[2015-03-04 07:55:07] Cono_: thank you WhereIsMySpoon
[2015-03-04 07:55:09] WhereIsMySpoon: Cono_: oh, that's not so bad then
[2015-03-04 07:55:20] *WhereIsMySpoon is still supporting ie8'
[2015-03-04 07:55:38] Cono_: but I feel that I have to address this IE issue sooner rather than later
[2015-03-04 07:55:51] Cono_: IE and Chrome to be honest before I start trying to make too much progress with FF
