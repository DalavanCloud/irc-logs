[2015-03-26 09:33:21] jimevans: is that a protocol error?
[2015-03-26 09:33:28] jimevans: i guess it is.
[2015-03-26 09:33:42] jimevans: could easily be a no-op though.
[2015-03-26 09:34:05] jimevans: actually, i think an empty array would be fine.
[2015-03-26 09:34:24] ato: Yes, empty array would be fine I think.
[2015-03-26 09:34:26] jimevans: a null parameter value should trigger an error.
[2015-03-26 09:34:47] ato: I only ask you because you seem to know these things (-;
[2015-03-26 09:34:59] *AutomatedTester thinks it should be a no-op'

[2015-03-26 09:35:17] ato: Well presumably Selenium does something today.
[2015-03-26 09:35:21] ato: The spec doesn't say anything.
[2015-03-26 09:35:40] ato: AutomatedTester: Failing mysteriously because you've sent the wrong type seems wors.e
[2015-03-26 09:36:13] ato: I can see users going sendKeys("foo") instead of sendKeys(["f", "o", "o"]) and not understanding why nothing happens.

[2015-03-26 09:37:08] ato: What do you mean by it lets it through?
[2015-03-26 09:37:25] AutomatedTester: I mean it goes from client to remote and back again with no error
[2015-03-26 09:37:28] jleyba: ato: sendKeys("foo") vs sendKeys(["f", "o", "o"]) is an api thing, not protocol?
[2015-03-26 09:37:36] AutomatedTester: yea
[2015-03-26 09:37:40] ato: jleyba: I'm talking about protocol here.
[2015-03-26 09:37:56] ato: AutomatedTester: So what does it do with the string?
[2015-03-26 09:37:56] AutomatedTester: the client takes 'goo' and turns it to ['g','o','o']
[2015-03-26 09:38:16] ato: I mean “the users of the protocol”.
[2015-03-26 09:38:46] jleyba: ato, "foo" is split to ["f", "o", "o"]
[2015-03-26 09:38:58] ato: Yes, on the client.
[2015-03-26 09:39:05] AutomatedTester: I dont know what the remote does if it hits remote as 'foo'
[2015-03-26 09:39:05] ato: I'm talking about what happens if you send "foo" to the server.

[2015-03-26 09:41:53] AutomatedTester: ato: Its probably undefined behaviour
[2015-03-26 09:42:04] jimevans: the protocol should probably return "invalid argument"
[2015-03-26 09:42:14] ato: Yeah, it seems to be missing from the Selenium protocol.
[2015-03-26 09:42:21] ato: jimevans: I agree, but it's not in there.
[2015-03-26 09:42:35] ato: jimevans: Therefore I was wondering what different existing drivers did (-:
[2015-03-26 09:42:37] jimevans: no, i mean in the spec, it should be specified.
[2015-03-26 09:42:38] AutomatedTester: ato: raise a spec bug so we make sure its documented
[2015-03-26 09:42:48] jimevans: AutomatedTester: +1
[2015-03-26 09:42:55] jleyba: I'd put it it in the spec as a global condition

[2015-03-26 09:43:13] ato: I can raise a bug too, but that doesn't solve my problem.
[2015-03-26 09:43:13] AutomatedTester: jleyba: as a global condition?
[2015-03-26 09:43:42] jleyba: AutomatedTester, "Any command input that is not of the expected type should result in an invalid argument error response"
[2015-03-26 09:43:48] jleyba: vs. documenting it on every command
[2015-03-26 09:44:11] AutomatedTester: jleyba: thats fine as long as we define the expected type in the command

[2015-03-26 09:46:36] ato: I reckon there's too many edge cases to say that generically.
[2015-03-26 09:46:54] ato: E.g. some commands take null as valid arguments.

[2015-03-26 12:51:17] stephend: alright, folks, in addition to slimerjs, ghostdriver, casperjs, The Intern, WebDriver.io - what are some of the other JS-based libraries/frameworks you're using?
[2015-03-26 12:51:25] Tuplario, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2015-03-26 12:54:04] stephend: ideally, we're looking for something both our devs + QA teams can use, together, to run end-to-end tests, using "real" browsers, against multiple servers (dev/stage/prod), and the ability to skip/xfail tests -- a tall order, I know :-)
[2015-03-26 12:54:50] stephend: we've got all those capabilities and more in our Python stack, but the Django guys unit-test, and the front-end JS guys want to test their way, so it'd be nice to meet with them in integration
[2015-03-26 12:56:57] AutomatedTester: stephend: the front end people refuse to write python?

[2015-03-26 12:58:26] stephend: in some ways, I think we'll have very limited success with what we're trying

[2015-03-26 12:59:06] AutomatedTester: stephend: so laura is ok with you rewriting all your infrastructure etc to support these people?
[2015-03-26 12:59:11] stephend: "I just want to write tests alongside my code, in my code" is what I hear - that's made harder right now by a) separate dev + QA repos + test-runners, for sure
[2015-03-26 12:59:16] stephend: but language is probably part of it
[2015-03-26 12:59:17] lukeis: when deciding javascript frameworks, you're lucky, you should have about 100 options… but you're also unlucky since you'll have 200 different opinions on which is best to use
[2015-03-26 12:59:28] stephend: lukeis: yeah, it's been tough
[2015-03-26 12:59:39] stephend: even the devs are having a hard time evaluating and choosing
[2015-03-26 12:59:58] stephend: AutomatedTester: nah, it's not like that
[2015-03-26 13:00:12] stephend: I see this as more of a gradual shift + working prototype/experiment
