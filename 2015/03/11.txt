[2015-03-11 03:47:56] similian: hellow selenians
[2015-03-11 03:49:31] similian: the following situation is getting to me - I am trying to use selenium hub for testing on our dev machines - now I guess I would have to setup some name resolution so the hub knows where to connect to ?
[2015-03-11 03:49:40] similian: is there a decent resolution to this?
[2015-03-11 03:50:22] similian: or do we have to include all dev machines into our NS and have the devs configure their local development environment seperately?
[2015-03-11 03:51:25] WhereIsMySpoon: you dont really need to set up a hub just for local selenium dev
[2015-03-11 03:51:30] WhereIsMySpoon: you can run tests without a hub
[2015-03-11 03:52:03] similian: well ... you are right -.-
[2015-03-11 03:52:20] WhereIsMySpoon: similian: I dont really think its worth to set up a hub for local selenium dev at all
[2015-03-11 03:52:21] similian: in some cases tho - the jenkins build fails
[2015-03-11 03:52:31] WhereIsMySpoon: for actual build testing on a centralised machine sure
[2015-03-11 03:52:41] WhereIsMySpoon: on a test server
[2015-03-11 03:52:51] similian: and we would like to run the Os X - Safari - Thingamabob
[2015-03-11 03:53:18] similian: ( i agree - it is a rare case )
[2015-03-11 03:53:49] WhereIsMySpoon: similian: the hub needs to be able to communicate with the nodes
[2015-03-11 03:53:55] WhereIsMySpoon: also the nodes connect to the hub, not the other way around
[2015-03-11 03:54:24] similian: that part does work -
[2015-03-11 03:54:30] WhereIsMySpoon: similian: it doesnt really make sense to me to centralise selenium test kickoffs to a hub when each dev will be doing different things
[2015-03-11 03:54:37] similian: but doesnt the hub call an url ?
[2015-03-11 03:54:47] similian: which has to be resolved by it
[2015-03-11 03:55:06] similian: I agree so far ... :D
[2015-03-11 03:55:10] WhereIsMySpoon: you can give it ips too
[2015-03-11 03:55:32] WhereIsMySpoon: thats what im doing
[2015-03-11 03:55:35] Dave_B_: yeah I use ips
[2015-03-11 03:56:17] similian: well we would have to customize our app for that ...
[2015-03-11 03:56:26] fabrice31_, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-03-11 03:56:29] WhereIsMySpoon: eh?
[2015-03-11 03:56:36] similian: I was just wondering what works for you guys ...
[2015-03-11 03:56:51] similian: well backend and frontend calls are distinguished by domain
[2015-03-11 03:56:53] fabrice31, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-11 03:56:58] WhereIsMySpoon: similian: I have the ip of my node in a properties file, and then when creating a RemoteWebDriver I use that property
[2015-03-11 03:57:15] similian: thats nice and clean :D
[2015-03-11 03:57:28] WhereIsMySpoon: its fairly normal..
[2015-03-11 03:58:00] WhereIsMySpoon: ^^
[2015-03-11 03:58:25] similian: guess I will try that with a series of  app.jiggamabob.dev21 domains in our NS
[2015-03-11 03:58:26] WhereIsMySpoon: similian: you havent really elicited your actual problem yet
[2015-03-11 03:58:42] similian: I think  your story helps
[2015-03-11 03:58:54] WhereIsMySpoon: ok..
[2015-03-11 03:59:05] similian: I will use prop files to let devs set their developer domain
[2015-03-11 03:59:18] similian: and setup the ns to resolv them properly
[2015-03-11 03:59:30] similian: its just required for a few devs
[2015-03-11 03:59:44] similian: all others use local drivers - today
[2015-03-11 04:00:20] WhereIsMySpoon: similian: why do these devs want a hub
[2015-03-11 04:00:31] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont see any advantage of it
[2015-03-11 04:01:03] WhereIsMySpoon: for testing using a test server on a test env its very useful
[2015-03-11 04:01:05] similian: for testing that one failed - OSX Safari fail
[2015-03-11 04:01:13] WhereIsMySpoon: there seems to be no sense in using dev machines as nodes to a hub
[2015-03-11 04:01:24] similian: maybe you are right :D
[2015-03-11 04:01:58] similian: debugging specific environments
[2015-03-11 04:03:01] similian: devs would only use hub for some builds
[2015-03-11 04:03:12] similian: they ar not becoming part of the hub
[2015-03-11 04:03:20] similian: they are just consuming it -
[2015-03-11 04:03:21] WhereIsMySpoon: you're much better off with them running local builds as the hub will not properly parallel thread tests unless you write the tests to do that
[2015-03-11 04:04:02] similian: and how would you debug Safari issues?
[2015-03-11 04:04:14] similian: Or explorer 6
[2015-03-11 04:04:20] similian: hahaha sorry
[2015-03-11 04:04:24] WhereIsMySpoon: i would first fire the client that is using ie6
[2015-03-11 04:04:25] similian: ie7 / 8
[2015-03-11 04:04:30] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-03-11 04:04:36] similian: hahahaah
[2015-03-11 04:04:40] similian: true
[2015-03-11 04:05:28] similian: It seems like I wont tough my neat selenium setup for now
[2015-03-11 04:05:32] similian: touch
[2015-03-11 04:05:53] similian: and have the devs discuss this a bit futher ...

[2015-03-11 08:42:40] Conio: I think I just answered my own question...that I don't have to override the load() method and make my navigation be URL-based
[2015-03-11 08:43:47] Conio: I'm trying to make my tests be as authentic as to what a user would do...and users don't paste in or use URLs to get to the various pages...they just click on ui controls
[2015-03-11 08:44:22] Dave_B_: if the test is testing navigation between pages then use the ui controls :)
[2015-03-11 08:44:55] Conio: makes sense to me...but I am a bit of a rookie at this
[2015-03-11 08:44:56] farlan1, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-03-11 08:45:03] Dave_B_: I jump via URL to certain pages in my tests as it makes the tests faster and means e.g. a broken nav bar will cause the nav bar tests to fail, but not *all* the tests to fail
[2015-03-11 08:45:18] Conio: I guess I was just wondering how to override the load() of LoadableComponent
[2015-03-11 08:45:22] Dave_B_: makes it much faster working out what's broken :)
[2015-03-11 08:45:33] Dave_B_: sorry, I don't use the C# bindings so can't help you there :(

[2015-03-11 08:47:13] Conio: hmn, I may shy away from the LoadableComponent base class for now
[2015-03-11 08:48:16] Conio: in my case, as I'm envisioning it, my page objects would have to inherit from an application base page as well as the LoadableComponent base class...
[2015-03-11 08:49:19] Conio: or perhaps have my base page inherit from LoadableComponent, and then have my page objects inherit from my base page object...gets hairy

[2015-03-11 09:25:57] lukeis: No More RC!
[2015-03-11 09:25:59] lukeis: :)
[2015-03-11 09:26:05] jimevans: thankyew!!!
[2015-03-11 09:26:42] lukeis: rfish: you mean,  driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#s2id_autogen6 > .select2-choice")).click();   ?
[2015-03-11 09:26:55] rfish: no
[2015-03-11 09:27:02] lukeis: (sorry, that was a troll)
[2015-03-11 09:27:22] rfish: and it is complaining something about sizzle
[2015-03-11 09:27:29] lukeis: but seriously, you should be trying to migrate your tests / scripts from RC to WebDriver
[2015-03-11 09:27:39] rfish: oh ok
[2015-03-11 09:28:30] ato: rfish: RC is deprecated and none of the active developers use it, so I'm not sure we can be very helpful answering RC questions.
[2015-03-11 09:28:53] rfish: ERROR: Caught exception [ERROR: Unsupported command [clickAt | css=#s2id_autogen6 > .select2-choice | ]]
[2015-03-11 09:29:25] lukeis: more motivation for you to migrate :)
[2015-03-11 09:29:34] rfish: I tried migrating and it said that
[2015-03-11 09:29:37] sircapsalot: what are these C-  R-  D- prefixes in the github labels?
[2015-03-11 09:29:49] lukeis: ato: ^ :)
[2015-03-11 09:29:58] ato: sircapsalot: They have no particular meaning apart from grouping related labels together.
[2015-03-11 09:30:03] lukeis: ato: you should make a wiki about them?
[2015-03-11 09:30:06] rfish: how do I do clickAt?
[2015-03-11 09:30:26] lukeis: rfish: i should the example line in webdriver above ^^
[2015-03-11 09:30:29] ato: sircapsalot: So you can type "R-" and get a list of everything that has to do with review and "C-" to get the list of components all together.
[2015-03-11 09:30:38] ato: lukeis: Can do.
[2015-03-11 09:30:44] sircapsalot: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/labels
[2015-03-11 09:31:40] sircapsalot: i was just wondering if maybe the R- stood for Review, C- stood for Code, etc
[2015-03-11 09:31:46] lukeis: yes
[2015-03-11 09:32:04] lukeis: not sure what D- is though? Device?
[2015-03-11 09:32:11] ato: I initially thought about C for Components, but whatever you find useful to connect with it (-:
[2015-03-11 09:32:17] ato: I thought Driver.
[2015-03-11 09:32:22] lukeis: ah
[2015-03-11 09:32:33] lukeis: atoms isn't really a driver ;)
[2015-03-11 09:32:35] rfish: clickAt is different than click no?
[2015-03-11 09:32:36] ato: The point is just that they only serve to group related labels together.
[2015-03-11 09:32:45] lukeis: rfish: how so?
[2015-03-11 09:32:47] AutomatedTester: U == uptown girl
[2015-03-11 09:32:59] jimevans: :yt uptown girl
[2015-03-11 09:33:06] rfish: one actually does a mouse click (clickAt) and click just triggers the event
[2015-03-11 09:33:07] lukeis: I - ipanema
[2015-03-11 09:33:21] lukeis: :yt girl from ipanema
[2015-03-11 09:33:40] rfish: the select2 element doesn't respond to click
[2015-03-11 09:33:46] ato: It's actually very useful.  If you go to a PR and type "l" to open the labelling dropdown, you can go "R-" and get just the list of available review actions instead of having to scroll through the full list in alphabetically (not colourised) order.
[2015-03-11 09:33:48] lukeis: rfish: webdirver is effectively "clickAt"
[2015-03-11 09:34:16] lukeis: webdriver attempts to emulate a user

[2015-03-11 14:17:51] nirvdrum: At the end of the day, I think it's probably a valid option to have.  The Ruby bindings, for instance, have it.  But, I think it's the wrong fix for what they want.
[2015-03-11 14:18:09] nirvdrum: If the intent is to just retry on a TCP timeout, they're almost certainly going to DoS that box.
[2015-03-11 14:18:34] nirvdrum: So, I'm using this as an opportunity to figure out the use case a bit better while I have a captive audience :-)
[2015-03-11 14:18:39] ato: I have that feeling too.
[2015-03-11 14:19:35] ato: Good plan. If they want it for what we suspect they want it for, it would be interesting to know why the overall timeout doesn't kick in.
[2015-03-11 14:19:54] ato: If they at all set it.
[2015-03-11 14:20:01] nirvdrum: Yeah.
[2015-03-11 14:20:20] nirvdrum: If they're not setting it because they don't know about it, then we can do something on our end to work on educating users.
[2015-03-11 14:20:35] nirvdrum: That's more or less it.  I'll keep on top of it.

[2015-03-11 14:35:37] LocusAsaf: if I'm setting up my webdriver as a remote driver to use a selenium server do I need to start a virtual display if the selenium server doesn't have one?
[2015-03-11 14:36:16] dude-x: selenium server doesn't do anything with displays
[2015-03-11 14:36:20] dude-x: you have to set one yourself
[2015-03-11 14:36:45] dude-x: selenium server just starts browsers, and responds to http commands to talk to the browser driver
[2015-03-11 14:37:23] LocusAsaf: so If I say webdriver.Remote and point it to my selenium server, I'll want to set up headless testing with XVFB in my code as well, in other words just like I'm doing headless testing on my local machine?
[2015-03-11 14:37:54] dude-x: yeah
[2015-03-11 14:38:10] dude-x: say your server is Windows 7 running Java and the server
[2015-03-11 14:38:20] dude-x: you will want to have IE driver on the windows box
[2015-03-11 14:38:44] dude-x: or if its an ubuntu server with server, and Chrome, you will want to have chromedriver, and xvfb set up
[2015-03-11 14:38:58] LocusAsaf: does IE driver not require XVFB?
[2015-03-11 14:39:18] LocusAsaf: oh I guess windows can't be headless right?
[2015-03-11 14:39:21] dude-x: windows doesn't really have a virtual framebuffer as far as i know
[2015-03-11 14:39:24] dude-x: yeah
[2015-03-11 14:39:31] dude-x: windows can be pseudo-headless
[2015-03-11 14:39:41] LocusAsaf: but its always outputting the display
[2015-03-11 14:39:43] dude-x: don't know why i brought up windows
[2015-03-11 14:39:59] dude-x: but the point is the server needs all the software to display stuff
[2015-03-11 14:40:06] LocusAsaf: good to know, I've only ever done headless testing on an ubuntu server
[2015-03-11 14:40:25] dude-x: if you do headless on your local, all that means is you're not getting a browser blocking your view
[2015-03-11 14:40:27] LocusAsaf: and I've used pyvirtual display to do so
[2015-03-11 14:40:37] LocusAsaf: w/ xvfb
[2015-03-11 14:40:40] dude-x: it's pretty simple regardless to use xvfb
[2015-03-11 14:41:03] LocusAsaf: out of curiosity if you're doing headless on a macos locally do you use xvfb as well?
[2015-03-11 14:41:05] dude-x: pyvirtualdisplay is a nice convenience library
[2015-03-11 14:41:12] dude-x: i forgot if xvfb works on the mac
[2015-03-11 14:41:16] dude-x: in theory it should work
[2015-03-11 14:42:11] dude-x: a quick google search shows it works with a firefox that renders to x!!
[2015-03-11 14:42:13] dude-x: x11
[2015-03-11 14:42:19] LocusAsaf: nobody virtualizes mac do they?
[2015-03-11 14:42:52] dude-x: sauce does
[2015-03-11 14:43:18] dude-x: apple has loosen their grip on virtualization somewhat so it is possible to have mac os x in a VM
[2015-03-11 14:43:24] dude-x: buuut you need a mac server to run it
[2015-03-11 14:43:38] dude-x: which is why sauce bills mac minutes separately
[2015-03-11 14:43:55] LocusAsaf: interesting
[2015-03-11 14:44:17] LocusAsaf: sauce isn't cost effective for me so I set up all my own selenium servers
[2015-03-11 14:44:31] LocusAsaf: but we dont have a lot of mac users so I guess its fine

[2015-03-11 14:51:04] LocusAsaf: anyone feel free to field that question :)
[2015-03-11 14:55:17] jimevans: LocusAsaf: there will be differences. particularly with IE execution.
[2015-03-11 14:57:07] dude-x: LocusAsaf: Sauce uses Windows Server for IE tests
[2015-03-11 14:57:46] LocusAsaf: dude-x: so if I virtualize a windows server I'm in the same boat as sauce?
[2015-03-11 14:57:54] dude-x: more or less
[2015-03-11 14:58:02] dude-x: well sauce has other tools
[2015-03-11 14:58:11] LocusAsaf: also, can I use the chrome/firefox drivers on a windows server?
[2015-03-11 14:58:14] dude-x: like recording videos
[2015-03-11 14:58:14] LocusAsaf: dude-x: such as?
[2015-03-11 14:58:20] dude-x: logging
[2015-03-11 14:58:21] LocusAsaf: yup
[2015-03-11 14:58:34] LocusAsaf: it certainly is a good service
[2015-03-11 14:58:47] jimevans: LocusAsaf: you'll have to do extra configuration to make the "server OS" IE installation behave like the windows 7/8 installation of IE. that extra configuration is largely undocumented.
[2015-03-11 14:58:58] LocusAsaf: we just test thousands of minutes every month so its darn expensive
[2015-03-11 14:59:43] LocusAsaf: jimevans: I see, so its not as simple as setting up a server and loading in the IE driver
[2015-03-11 14:59:51] jimevans: nope not at all
[2015-03-11 15:00:23] jimevans: from the OS vendor's perspective, there's little-to-no need to interactively run a browser on a server OS.
[2015-03-11 15:01:04] dude-x: IE on Windows Server is really locked down by default. you are better off using regular windows 7/8 pro boxes
[2015-03-11 15:01:55] LocusAsaf: is there somewhere where I can just virtualize a 7/8 box?
[2015-03-11 15:02:22] dude-x: at the simplest level you can just use vmware
[2015-03-11 15:02:38] LocusAsaf: right
[2015-03-11 15:02:51] dude-x: but to treat it headlessly or as a unix like multi-user system it's a bit more limited
[2015-03-11 15:04:17] LocusAsaf: what would be the pain points?
[2015-03-11 15:04:33] dude-x: well suppose you had a real windows workstation
[2015-03-11 15:04:38] dude-x: on your desk
[2015-03-11 15:04:51] dude-x: if you were to RDC to it, it would lock out your workstation
[2015-03-11 15:05:02] dude-x: if you log in to the windows box, then you would terminate your RDC connection
[2015-03-11 15:05:48] dude-x: same thing would happen in your virtual instance of windows 7
[2015-03-11 15:06:18] LocusAsaf: so thats why sauce uses windows server probably
[2015-03-11 15:06:35] LocusAsaf: so they dont have to run thoursands of virtualized windows 7 machines
[2015-03-11 15:06:47] LocusAsaf: a windows server can probably handle more than 1 session I guess

[2015-03-11 15:36:40] Titus: Is there going to be a point release for the performance increase in Firefox from this change? https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/commit/4af80cca9131a345b935d6ae76e14f8bebabf6fe
[2015-03-11 15:37:19] lukeis: Titus: the performance degradation hasn't been confirmed / reproduced
[2015-03-11 15:37:54] lukeis: nor has this 'fix' confirmed it is fixed
[2015-03-11 15:38:07] lukeis: if there's an issue :)
[2015-03-11 15:38:17] Titus: if? :)
[2015-03-11 15:38:29] lukeis: i don't have a way to reproduce it, so… if :)

[2015-03-11 15:39:59] Titus: I don't know how to test with the ruby bindings.
[2015-03-11 15:40:11] lukeis: but i can't prove this fix fixes anything since i can't see the issue! :)

[2015-03-11 15:45:11] Titus: Well, here's an example of the problem: This with 2.44 (https://travis-ci.org/watir/watir-webdriver/builds/52374951) vs this with 2.45 (https://travis-ci.org/watir/watir-webdriver/builds/52700154)

[2015-03-11 15:45:47] lukeis: Titus: can you run that against the latest in master in Selenium?
[2015-03-11 15:45:58] lukeis: :latest
[2015-03-11 15:46:00] Titus: I will try
[2015-03-11 15:46:02] lukeis: ^
[2015-03-11 15:46:24] Titus: Jari would know how to do it, I'm still learning. :)
[2015-03-11 15:46:44] Titus: I think I can set the gemfile to pull from github instead of using the gem
[2015-03-11 15:46:50] lukeis: never know if jarib is lurking or awake ;)
[2015-03-11 15:47:20] Titus: Yeah, I'm trying hard to not pester him with things. :)
[2015-03-11 15:47:28] lukeis: heh
[2015-03-11 15:47:55] lukeis: he leaves big shoes to fill :)
[2015-03-11 15:48:43] Titus: p0deje and I can take over the watir changes easily enough, but I'm concerned about the selenium ruby bindings going forward
[2015-03-11 15:49:08] Titus: a lot more browser specific knowledge required
[2015-03-11 15:49:29] lukeis: the bindings are mostly stable
[2015-03-11 15:50:51] lukeis: real m-day can't come soon enough :)

[2015-03-11 15:54:48] Titus: Actually, any chance you can make a branch with 2.45 and just that commit? :)
[2015-03-11 15:55:11] Titus: I'll try running the watir tests with that commit reference in my gemfile
[2015-03-11 15:55:16] lukeis: nothing stopping you in a fork, is there? ;)
[2015-03-11 15:55:23] Titus: Oh, sheesh
[2015-03-11 15:55:29] Titus: sigh. long day.

[2015-03-11 15:57:51] lukeis: AutomatedTester: we're still running 2.42.2 and FF 31 though ;)
[2015-03-11 15:58:13] lukeis: presently still trying to upgrade :-D
[2015-03-11 15:58:23] AutomatedTester: lukeis: you guys need some committers in there to help sort things out
