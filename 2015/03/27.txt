[2015-03-27 09:48:27] lukeis: spec doesn't have to define how, just the what, right?

[2015-03-27 10:54:38] joshin4colours: so, I was going to ask on Twitter, but this seemed more...appropriate?
[2015-03-27 10:54:40] Tendoncs: It looks like html5 fullscreen requires user input, you cant even fake it out with send keyboard commands.
[2015-03-27 10:55:03] Tendoncs: AutomatedTester: What do you mean you need to implement fullscreen?
[2015-03-27 10:55:13] joshin4colours: anyone have examples of the selenium webdriver (or similar tools) used really ineffectively/badly?
[2015-03-27 10:55:33] AutomatedTester: Tendoncs: there is no implementation in webdriver for putting the browser into fullscreen mode
[2015-03-27 10:55:48] AutomatedTester: Tendoncs: and there is no specification on how to do that either
[2015-03-27 10:56:55] Tendoncs: I see.
[2015-03-27 10:57:03] AutomatedTester: Tendoncs: I am trying to help get webdriver properly specified
[2015-03-27 10:57:06] AutomatedTester: http://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html
[2015-03-27 10:57:55] Tendoncs: What I did was create a button that puts it into full screen then used Selenium to click the button. the place user input comes in is the Html5 "warning message"
[2015-03-27 10:58:36] AutomatedTester: ahh... this is a door hanger type modal...
[2015-03-27 10:58:49] Tendoncs: Thanks for the link
[2015-03-27 10:58:55] Tendoncs: I will read up on it this weekend at home
[2015-03-27 10:59:10] AutomatedTester: Tendoncs: I am warning you... it needs A LOT of work

[2015-03-27 10:59:30] Tendoncs: Ok, then I will skim

[2015-03-27 11:00:53] AutomatedTester: :D
[2015-03-27 11:01:29] Tendoncs: The problem I have is everything works fine with firefox. But firefox 33. on rapsberry pi blinks on the website when I image swap. So I have to either fix the code or switch browsers. When on Rapsberry pi 2 running ubuntu its all new
[2015-03-27 11:01:49] Tendoncs: oh wow

[2015-03-27 11:06:25] Tendoncs: So, I read your reply again. I do not understand. My be due to a lack of coffee. Can selenium work with chromium?

[2015-03-27 11:08:02] lukeis: i don't think they cross compiled chromedriver to run on arm :)

[2015-03-27 11:10:09] Tendoncs: It all fell apart when I tried assign a profile
[2015-03-27 11:10:46] Tendoncs: the firefox driver works like a charm
[2015-03-27 11:11:04] Tendoncs: However the version of firefox I can get to work on the pi blinks when it switchs out images
[2015-03-27 11:11:20] Tendoncs: I cant have metrics blinking at the VPs/directors.

[2015-03-27 14:04:38] dude-x: threading is okay in python for I/O so long as no shared state.
[2015-03-27 14:04:45] dude-x: but then you have problems when things go wrong
[2015-03-27 14:07:50] ato: Yes, shared sate is difficult.
[2015-03-27 14:07:53] ato: state.
[2015-03-27 14:07:56] ato: Also debugging.
[2015-03-27 14:08:08] ato: Because pdb is really quite stupid.

[2015-03-27 14:10:57] lukeis: ato: i think they're building you a new airplane and underestimated the effort… so they'll be throwing in double the workers, hoping it will be done in half the time
[2015-03-27 14:11:06] ato: Been in transit for 14 hours going from London to Oslo.
[2015-03-27 14:11:17] jimevans: right.
[2015-03-27 14:11:18] ato: It usually takes 2 hours by plane.
[2015-03-27 14:11:19] lukeis: why didn't you fly direct? ;)
[2015-03-27 14:11:37] ato: Because cheap and because points.
[2015-03-27 14:11:50] dude-x: sometimes they don't offer direct at economy

[2015-03-27 14:11:53] ato: And I had today off, so I didn't mind the extra layover.
