Whenever that happens, Selenium Remote Webdriver is unable to locate elements on the webpage. If I quickly close the prompt, the check proceeds as usual. Could someone please advise how to request blocking the Java plugin using Selenium Remote Webdriver for Firefox (python)?

[2015-03-20 08:19:15] sircapsalot: well, i mainly advocate it for github pages because 1) github supports it out of the box 2) no need to fiddle with sgml. it's all markdown
[2015-03-20 08:20:17] sircapsalot: and since it is, it's easy to do stuff like ```java someCodeHere()``` and it's all rendered using pygments. right now, the doc uses <code class="java"></code>

[2015-03-20 09:43:42] AnConio: oddly, of all the style attribute changes that are taking place...and there's lots...they all seem to be only modifying the top style attribute....incrementally changing it ever so slightly in term of px...as if the top location is slowly being "dialed in"
[2015-03-20 09:45:13] ato: lukeis: I'm not sure how I feel about the rest of the crap on that downloads page either…
[2015-03-20 09:45:23] lukeis: :)

[2015-03-20 09:48:03] ato: lukeis: FWIW the reason I've started liking merge commits is two-fold: Github fixed them a little so they're not epidemically stupid anymore, and they contain the push information which can be quite important when dealing with CI's.
[2015-03-20 09:48:16] ato: lukeis: Also they contain links and references to the Github PR page.

[2015-03-20 13:26:46] lukeis: FrankyBoy1234: regarding your last comment on that issue… the support class is really an optional (although recommended) set of utilities, you don't *have to* use them… and if there's a more optimal way to handle your case, then please do :)

[2015-03-20 13:27:36] jleyba: ato: I'd gladly trade the data migration headaches I've been dealing with for some code to debug
[2015-03-20 13:27:52] ato: jleyba: Even if it depends on the mode in which you run X?
[2015-03-20 13:28:16] ato: jleyba: My test passes if run X forwarded, but crashes if run in a _virtual_ framebuffer.
[2015-03-20 13:28:26] FrankyBoy1234: well, background story is, I am taking over some automation framework built on top of protractor.net (haha, jeah thats a thing) and cleaning up the insanity and trying to figure out what of the tons of helper methods are either useless or should be contributed back and so on
[2015-03-20 13:28:28] jleyba: ato: +1. They've grown far too organically. I'd love to throw it all out and start over

[2015-03-20 13:28:55] jleyba: (and maybe I'll keep my data migration stuff over your X issues)
[2015-03-20 13:29:08] ato: Pitch your idea to simon for 3.0?
[2015-03-20 13:29:13] ato: Eh, 4.0 even.
[2015-03-20 13:29:52] jleyba: We're probably not going to make the 1 Apr date for 3.0
[2015-03-20 13:30:31] jleyba: trying to think about 4.0 is just depressing. We'll never get there
[2015-03-20 13:31:08] FrankyBoy1234: some other general question, regarding people who might have worked with both the js- sd well as the .net/java version ... in js there is this super neat ElementFinder thing which unifies the locators and actual objects, i.e. you kinda have driver.elementExists included in your iwebelement which really simplifies writing page objects
[2015-03-20 13:31:14] ato: jleyba: You did notice the date? (_:
[2015-03-20 13:31:15] ato: (-:
[2015-03-20 13:31:35] jleyba: That's why I proposed using it :)
[2015-03-20 13:31:53] ato: jleyba: I actually, sanely, think it's a good idea to start a discussion about redesigning certain support APIs though.
[2015-03-20 13:32:02] ato: jleyba: davehunt was just telling me the other day.
[2015-03-20 13:32:06] jleyba: FrankyBoy1234, ElementFinder is a protractor thing isn't it?
[2015-03-20 13:32:13] FrankyBoy1234: hm, might b
[2015-03-20 13:32:26] FrankyBoy1234: my experience in that regard comes from ptor
[2015-03-20 13:32:36] ato: Trying a new set out as selenium.newsupport or something wouldn't be too bad.
[2015-03-20 13:32:36] lukeis: FrankyBoy1234: i don't agree with adding that to the Select interface ( #350 ) adds too much bloat to it. And the user should have reference to the original WebElement if they want it, since you know, they had to create the Select to begin with…
[2015-03-20 13:33:10] jimevans: lukeis: +1
[2015-03-20 13:33:22] lukeis: i leave that to jimevans to close though ;)
[2015-03-20 13:33:31] lukeis: if it was java, i'd close it right now :)
[2015-03-20 13:33:43] jimevans: also, in your page object in .NET, it's pretty easy to wrap the creation of a SelectElement in a property too.
[2015-03-20 13:33:49] FrankyBoy1234: well, for page objects its convenient simply ... you just expose your select and if you really need the base you just do select.Base or somethinglike that
[2015-03-20 13:34:23] lukeis: Selenium WebDriver objects shouldn't be bled through your PageObjects :)
[2015-03-20 13:34:24] FrankyBoy1234: without having to have both in your page element and people wrapping it all over again because they are too stupid to look
[2015-03-20 13:35:01] jimevans: yeah, there's a gross misunderstanding between the proper implementation of the Page Object pattern, and what i call a "Page Wrapper" pattern.

[2015-03-20 13:37:28] FrankyBoy1234: I'll just give an example ...
[2015-03-20 13:39:23] FrankyBoy1234: login -> username-field, password-field, submit-button ... testcases like "fill only username, you should get error x", "fill only password, you should get error y" (errors also highlight field) ... obviously it makes sense to have a "login" method in that PO to do the common "just log me in" case, but for all the TCs that actually test the form and such you pretty much need more-or-less direct access to the elements.

[2015-03-20 13:40:49] jimevans: FrankyBoy1234: i can think of other ways to handle that, but it's late, i'm tired, and i'm supremely cranky.
[2015-03-20 13:40:57] jimevans: so best if i just not.
[2015-03-20 13:41:07] FrankyBoy1234: jim: also in Europe I take it? ^^
[2015-03-20 13:41:17] jimevans: no, U.S. east coast.
[2015-03-20 13:41:27] jimevans: but it's been a *very* long and trying week.
[2015-03-20 13:41:44] ato: jimevans: ++
[2015-03-20 13:41:47] FrankyBoy1234: ah, totally, then I won't keep you from your well-deserved weekend :)
[2015-03-20 13:41:49] ato: jimevans: For the two of us.
[2015-03-20 13:42:09] FrankyBoy1234: RUN JIMEVANS, RUN!

[2015-03-20 13:42:34] jimevans: FrankyBoy1234: i'll be around for another hour or so. i'm just not going to be drawn into contentious discussions, where i have to defend my opinions.
[2015-03-20 13:42:35] jimevans: :)
[2015-03-20 13:42:37] ato: From my knowledge of American Hollywood film that should've contained at least an instance of "Jump".
[2015-03-20 13:43:14] jimevans: $deity i hate rc.
[2015-03-20 13:43:29] ato: Why hasn't it been deprected yet?
[2015-03-20 13:43:32] ato: deprecated
[2015-03-20 13:43:33] FrankyBoy1234: Hey, you don't have to defend anything. Its just how we started doing stuff because it seemed like the best way to us ;)
[2015-03-20 13:43:33] FrankyBoy1234: Better ways always appreciated (at least for consideration) :D
[2015-03-20 13:44:15] jimevans: i'm working on refactoring the page factory implementation in .net
[2015-03-20 13:44:36] ato: I tried using that in Java a few months back, but gave up.
[2015-03-20 13:44:48] ato: It uses statics in a lot of places, if I remember correctly.
[2015-03-20 13:45:42] FrankyBoy1234: anyhow, also late on this side of the atlantic so I'll take a hike again. Nice talking to y'all :)

[2015-03-20 13:46:05] ato: It's the wrong time of year for that.
[2015-03-20 13:48:56] jleyba: lukeis: was the ff perf bug fixed?
[2015-03-20 13:49:12] jimevans: i will say one thing about the java page factory, it delegates the evaluating of the annotations to a different class. the .NET implementation doesn't. yet.
[2015-03-20 13:49:37] lukeis: jleyba: i believe so
[2015-03-20 13:50:00] ato: lukeis: Was it?
[2015-03-20 13:50:18] lukeis: yes, the watir-webdriver guys confirmed the fix in master fixes their perf issue
[2015-03-20 13:50:24] ato: Excellent.
[2015-03-20 13:50:29] lukeis: no others have been raised
[2015-03-20 13:50:34] lukeis: that i'm aware of
[2015-03-20 13:53:03] ato: Is this the right place to complain about Mercurial?
[2015-03-20 13:53:15] ato: I'm about to say some very unflattering things out loud.
[2015-03-20 13:55:33] lukeis:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-03-20 13:55:40] *lukeis doesn't use it at all for anything'
[2015-03-20 13:56:01] lukeis: only thing i briefly touched it with was webdriver spec :) now, thankfully… git!
[2015-03-20 13:57:17] ato: Good thing about working late: Californians are apparently all drunk and try has a low queue.
