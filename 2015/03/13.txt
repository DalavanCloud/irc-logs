[2015-03-13 03:26:58] Padawan: hey guys, i was learning selenium with python and all, and then i heard about this project: does anyone use it? https://splinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html
[2015-03-13 03:27:10] simonstewart: Back again
[2015-03-13 03:28:31] Dave_B_: Padawan: not heard of it no, I'd be willing to bet it's built on the same stuff tho :)
[2015-03-13 03:29:17] Dave_B_: 'Splinter is an abstraction layer on top of existing browser automation tools such as http://seleniumhq.org/'
[2015-03-13 03:29:30] Dave_B_: if you like it's abstraction then go for it
[2015-03-13 03:29:46] Dave_B_: generally i find abstraction layers are annoying and jsut make debugging harder, but they can make getting started easier
[2015-03-13 03:30:21] Dave_B_: other people love them so don't take my not liking them to mean you shouldn't use them tho!
[2015-03-13 03:31:39] Padawan: Dave_B_: Nah, i was just being curious. I would prefer to user the source. Like, i guess it makes it easier to start but when a real problem comes along, you need to run for your mamma
[2015-03-13 03:37:23] Dave_B_: it doesn't look like it's miles from the source - though this is a mixed blessing as it'd probably make debugging less annoying but also means you're basically writing the same code you would be anyway, just with a slightly different syntax & with a smaller supporting community

[2015-03-13 03:58:54] Lope: I've started firefox with webdriverJS, then I open additional windows with driver.executeScript("window.open();"); I would like to be able to close the original window. But when I try to do it in the console firefox says that javascript can only close windows that were opened with JS. and also driver.executeScript("window.close();"); doesn't work on it either. I've looked inside the driver.manage() and driver.manage().window() object
[2015-03-13 03:58:54] Lope: s and there are methods to set position etc, but not to close the window. Any ideas?
[2015-03-13 04:03:36] Dave_B_: driver.close()
[2015-03-13 04:03:59] Dave_B_: closes the window with focus
[2015-03-13 04:04:51] Dave_B_: not sure why you're trying to do it all as driver.executeScript, but then I've never used webdriverJS
[2015-03-13 04:04:56] Dave_B_: maybe there are reasons
[2015-03-13 04:06:32] WhereIsMySpoon: Lope: pretty much what dave said, and you should question why you're opening all these windows with executeScript
[2015-03-13 04:07:50] Lope: WhereIsMySpoon: I'm new at using selenium with multiple windows... I figure the two way to open multiple windows is window.open() and also to somehow click links in a way to open them in a new window?
[2015-03-13 04:08:20] Dave_B_: 1) Why do you want multiple windows?
[2015-03-13 04:08:27] Lope: But a lot of websites are JS based these days, so if you want another window you have to open the window yourself. Simply shift clicking doesn't mean you'll open a link in a new window.
[2015-03-13 04:08:40] Dave_B_: 2) Why not use two driver instances if you really must have several windows?
[2015-03-13 04:09:06] Lope: Dave_B_: the app I'm testing is one intended to be used in multiple tabs. Selenium can't do multiple tabs easily, so I'm using multiple windows.
[2015-03-13 04:09:34] Lope: I can't use separate instances because the multiple windows must be working in the same logged in session.
[2015-03-13 04:09:41] Dave_B_: if it's intended to be used in multiple tabs (wtf?) then it should let you open multiple tabs :p
[2015-03-13 04:10:20] Lope: Hey, I'm just the testing guy :p
[2015-03-13 04:10:21] Dave_B_: also, again, why driver.executeScript("window.close();");  instead of driver.close(); ?
[2015-03-13 04:10:38] Dave_B_: executeScript is occasionally of use, but shouldn't be your starting point
[2015-03-13 04:10:52] Lope: Oh yes, I'm using driver.close() now, it works better.
[2015-03-13 04:11:09] Dave_B_: If it doesn't let you open multiple tabs and you need multiple to test then that's a test failure right there
[2015-03-13 04:11:11] Lope: thanks :)
[2015-03-13 04:11:14] Dave_B_: no worries :)
[2015-03-13 04:11:42] Lope: well, it CAN be used in multiple tabs and many users use it like that.

[2015-03-13 04:30:23] Padawan: I have a page that people use to search articles, in this page, there are a dropdown to N databases to be selected, only, this renders a new url, but the page is the same. How would this fit in the page object pattern?
[2015-03-13 04:31:54] Padawan: should i do a generic class and inherit it for each DatabaseSearch children?
[2015-03-13 04:32:02] WhereIsMySpoon: Padawan: is the content that is on the page similar or the same?
[2015-03-13 04:32:11] WhereIsMySpoon: think in terms of visible content, not urls
[2015-03-13 04:32:33] WhereIsMySpoon: i guess that this dropdown renders the data from each db?
[2015-03-13 04:32:37] Padawan: WhereIsMySpoon: exactly the same
[2015-03-13 04:33:10] Padawan: it only alters the url within the page
[2015-03-13 04:33:13] Dave_B_: sounds like the same page object to me :)
[2015-03-13 04:33:19] WhereIsMySpoon: Padawan: if the containing html and structure is the same i see no need to make generic classes or anything, just use one page object
[2015-03-13 04:33:27] wdj, quitting. (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[2015-03-13 04:34:27] WhereIsMySpoon: is there a reason why you thought you shouldnt/
[2015-03-13 04:34:28] WhereIsMySpoon: ?*
[2015-03-13 04:36:02] WhereIsMySpoon: i could see your solution being useful for example if you have a data view in your page and your db dropdown changes completely what is in this widget, for one option its a table of data, then for another its a graph...then you could have separate DataWidgetGraphView, DataWidgetTableView etc
[2015-03-13 04:36:05] Padawan: yes, like im reading a lot of people put a method inside a page for it to check, generally it reads title, or some content. thinking about my tests later on, how would i generalize checking this page if i want also to change its database from time to time
[2015-03-13 04:36:26] WhereIsMySpoon: that all subclass the main containing widget or page, which doesnt change
[2015-03-13 04:36:44] WhereIsMySpoon: but if its literally all the same structure and all that changes is the data content then dont bother
[2015-03-13 04:42:53] Padawan: would you guys prefer check the a page object by its title or something else within the page?

[2015-03-13 04:45:50] Dave_B_: varies for me, if I'm checking I'm on the right palce sometimes it's by object in page, sometimes title is enough

[2015-03-13 04:47:43] Padawan: okay, thanks a lot guys.
[2015-03-13 04:49:08] WhereIsMySpoon: Padawan: as dave said, totally depends
[2015-03-13 04:50:09] Dave_B_: Hmm, my english skills & my typing are both doing well today! on the right palce? :/
[2015-03-13 04:50:12] Padawan: so, for instance, if i know tests gonna use some elements in my page, it should be nice i already check those when page loads?
[2015-03-13 04:50:13] Dave_B_: *place! :/
[2015-03-13 04:51:53] Dave_B_: I don't generally pre-check a bunch of elements, just let the tests run into them and throw nosuchelementexception (sometimes elements won't exist on first page load etc anyway) - but I do generally make sure I'm on the right page before interacting with it as otherwise it can get a bit confusing (especially if the first few elements you interact exist on whatever other page you're on too, can make it non-obvious why things failed)
[2015-03-13 04:53:11] Padawan: i see
[2015-03-13 04:53:35] Padawan: well that was really enlightening

[2015-03-13 09:11:43] simonstewart: I believe that the law has changed in the 10 years this project has been running
[2015-03-13 09:11:49] ato: Basically what the open source licenses are saying is that we're additionally giving you some extra freedoms to do things with the source.
[2015-03-13 09:12:13] simonstewart: http://www.apache.org/dev/apply-license.html#copy-per-file
[2015-03-13 09:12:44] simonstewart: I really don't think there's any value in us going through every file and changing it
[2015-03-13 09:12:45] ato: But if it's a requirement, it feels like something we could get a computer to do.
[2015-03-13 09:12:49] lukeis: so… should we do that? simonstewart
[2015-03-13 09:12:59] ato: simonstewart: Oh interesting.
[2015-03-13 09:12:59] simonstewart: What a fucking pointless waste of time
[2015-03-13 09:13:19] lukeis: removing copyright? or just adopting a policy to not have copyright on new files?
[2015-03-13 09:13:24] simonstewart: We probably need a minimal copyright in there claiming the file for the project and SFC
[2015-03-13 09:13:38] simonstewart: But we don't need the entire Apache license header there

[2015-03-13 09:14:33] lukeis: simonstewart: standard is to just put it in a LICENSE file at the root of the repo

[2015-03-13 09:14:52] Padawan, joining. (#selenium)

[2015-03-13 09:15:32] ato: It would reduce the turnover time on PRs by quite a bit I think.
[2015-03-13 09:15:39] simonstewart: If there's still stuff that's relevant in essentially infinity that needs copyright protection, a few years either way isn't going to hurt
[2015-03-13 09:15:55] lukeis: sircapsalot: no problem, and I saw someone else do it recently too ;)
[2015-03-13 09:15:57] AutomatedTester: at Mozilla we have per file but its a tiny thing linking to the full license

[2015-03-13 09:16:23] ato: By “quite a bit” I mean “time for a reviewer to point out to update the copyright notice, the author to read it, push a new change, and for the reviewer to look at the PR again”.
[2015-03-13 09:16:27] ato: So one iteration.
[2015-03-13 09:16:45] simonstewart: Meh. As we squash, we can modify the headers
[2015-03-13 09:17:13] ato: So I don't have a particular desire to modify it either (-:

[2015-03-13 10:03:19] ato: If we had an API for querying the CLA document that would really great.
[2015-03-13 10:03:34] ato: We could use that to write a Github bot to comment on authors who are not in the list.

[2015-03-13 10:10:21] KostyaSha: WhereIsMySpoon not sure that you will download and debug, question is mostly theorethical whether xpath should be calculated relative to WebElement
[2015-03-13 10:10:33] WhereIsMySpoon: no i will not downlload and debug
[2015-03-13 10:10:44] WhereIsMySpoon: KostyaSha: xpath has syntax for it being relative or not
[2015-03-13 10:10:54] WhereIsMySpoon: KostyaSha: use // for relative, / for global
[2015-03-13 10:11:13] jleyba: WhereIsMySpoon, that's not correct.  // and / are both global
[2015-03-13 10:11:16] jleyba: .// and ./ are relative
[2015-03-13 10:11:17] KostyaSha: WhereIsMySpoon i know how xpath works, the question is about WebElement and how it applies xpath
[2015-03-13 10:11:47] jleyba: WebElement applies xpath as given. If you need relative, you better provide a relative selector
[2015-03-13 10:12:02] lukeis: ato: what's the "wrong" label?
[2015-03-13 10:12:04] WhereIsMySpoon: KostyaSha: im going to say that xpath should work in the way you apply the syntax, it would make no sense to do myElement.findElement(By.xpath("/div... and have it apply from the webelements dom
[2015-03-13 10:12:04] KostyaSha: jleyba, but WebElement itself not a whole page
[2015-03-13 10:12:25] jleyba: driver.findElement(By.id("foo")).findElement(By.xpath("//body"))
[2015-03-13 10:12:30] ato: lukeis: I was thinking something along the lines of “this thing is behaving wrongly, it's not functioning as expected”.
[2015-03-13 10:12:32] jleyba: ^ is the same as driver.findElement(By.xpath("//body")
[2015-03-13 10:12:45] ato: lukeis: I'm open to better suggestions (-:
[2015-03-13 10:12:54] WhereIsMySpoon: KostyaSha: ^ there's 0 reason to make it be relative and it would be counterproductive nad confusing
[2015-03-13 10:13:09] WhereIsMySpoon: "lets use xpath but actually change what the user puts in to make it do something else"
[2015-03-13 10:13:13] lukeis: ato: i'll have a think… seems like "wrong" implies the user is wrong ;)
[2015-03-13 10:13:13] WhereIsMySpoon: no thanks
[2015-03-13 10:13:21] ato: lukeis: Yeah.
[2015-03-13 10:13:30] KostyaSha: WhereIsMySpoon this is OOP if i get child object, then i expect methods to be applid on it and not on root/parent
[2015-03-13 10:13:44] WhereIsMySpoon: KostyaSha: it has nothing to do with oop
[2015-03-13 10:13:45] lukeis: ato: but isn't that redudant? cause it is an issue… do we have to label an issue is an issue? if it wasn't it would be closed
[2015-03-13 10:13:53] jleyba: settled issue, won't change. I've told you how it behaves, update your code accordingly
[2015-03-13 10:13:59] KostyaSha: it looks like a proxy from child method to root
[2015-03-13 10:14:13] KostyaSha: + not documented in javadoc...
[2015-03-13 10:14:19] WhereIsMySpoon: now what you could argue is that xpath shouldnt be allowed in a WebElement's findElement call and only in the call from WebDriver
[2015-03-13 10:14:29] WhereIsMySpoon: but thats a different argument
[2015-03-13 10:14:58] ato: lukeis: Well an issue could be a papercut, a perf regression, a security issue, a task to refactor something, or similar.
[2015-03-13 10:14:59] jleyba: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#findElements(org.openqa.selenium.By)
[2015-03-13 10:15:05] jleyba: ": a search prefixed with "//" will search the entire document, not just the children of this current node."
[2015-03-13 10:15:13] jleyba: It's in the javadoc. Settled issue. Use the API correctly
[2015-03-13 10:15:28] WhereIsMySpoon: and i wouldnt agree with that argument anyway
[2015-03-13 10:15:52] WhereIsMySpoon: as JL says, its doc'd and it makes complete sense, so this will not change
[2015-03-13 10:16:04] KostyaSha: hm..
[2015-03-13 10:16:09] lukeis: ato: i agree… so, "wrong" isn't adding any value as a label though
[2015-03-13 10:16:09] ato: lukeis: “bug” might work, though that would also apply to a perf regression and a safety issue as well.
[2015-03-13 10:16:55] WhereIsMySpoon: eh im not in a position to say "will not" as im not a selenium dev :P but i would say that I would very much doubt if it will change, and JL just said it will not and he is a dev :)
[2015-03-13 10:17:09] KostyaSha: WhereIsMySpoon i have org.seleniumhq....

[2015-03-13 10:18:53] WhereIsMySpoon: built by google
[2015-03-13 10:19:30] jleyba: WhereIsMySpoon, wasn't my question :)
[2015-03-13 10:19:41] KostyaSha: what is the difference between org.seleniumhq and org.openqa.selenium?
[2015-03-13 10:20:54] lukeis: jleyba: wait for simon
[2015-03-13 10:21:11] ato: jleyba: There seems to be enough consensus on the mailing list.
[2015-03-13 10:21:13] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: what is the l-wrong label?
[2015-03-13 10:21:24] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis and I was just discussing that.  See the backlog.
[2015-03-13 10:21:25] KostyaSha: jleyba, in general thanks for help
[2015-03-13 10:21:29] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: see discussion above ^^
[2015-03-13 10:22:03] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: uh, whereabouts
[2015-03-13 10:22:05] WhereIsMySpoon: :log
[2015-03-13 10:22:17] WhereIsMySpoon: hours above? or minutes

[2015-03-13 10:22:40] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: Basically lukeis was confused too, and neither of us could come up with a better suggestion.
[2015-03-13 10:22:52] WhereIsMySpoon: ah right i get it

[2015-03-13 10:22:59] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: maybe a better word would be defect

[2015-03-13 10:23:11] lukeis: ato: "BehavingBadly" ? :)
[2015-03-13 10:23:17] WhereIsMySpoon: defect-new defect-regression
[2015-03-13 10:23:21] WhereIsMySpoon: and so on
[2015-03-13 10:23:38] ato: A defect can be anything.
[2015-03-13 10:23:42] ato: I think regression is worth having.
[2015-03-13 10:24:00] WhereIsMySpoon: thats why i put defect-new and defect-regression
[2015-03-13 10:24:03] WhereIsMySpoon: as separate labels
[2015-03-13 10:24:17] WhereIsMySpoon: as opposed to maybe spec-new
[2015-03-13 10:24:24] jleyba: can we mirror gc labels?
[2015-03-13 10:24:24] WhereIsMySpoon: or doc

[2015-03-13 10:25:49] WhereIsMySpoon: jleyba: sounds like a good idea
[2015-03-13 10:25:57] ato: Okay, so defect makes sense.
[2015-03-13 10:26:01] ato: Fixed is replicated by closing just closing, I think.  wontfix I think it's worth bringing over.  New issues that aren't accepted should just be closed.
[2015-03-13 10:26:24] jleyba: ato I use accepted as "I'm actively working on this now"
[2015-03-13 10:26:46] ato: We can use the assigned field for that though.
[2015-03-13 10:27:05] ato: A query for which issues are assigned to see what's in progress makes sense.  Just unassign if not in progress.
[2015-03-13 10:27:32] ato: Changed I-wrong to I-defect.
[2015-03-13 10:28:37] KostyaSha: jleyba, cool, // replace to .// fixed issue. But still have no idea what is difference between openqa group ans seleniumhq
[2015-03-13 10:29:22] WhereIsMySpoon: using .// seems like a total waste of 2 characters
[2015-03-13 10:29:27] WhereIsMySpoon: er, one characer
[2015-03-13 10:30:29] KostyaSha: WhereIsMySpoon do you mean it should be ./ ?
[2015-03-13 10:31:07] jleyba: WhereIsMySpoon:  ".//div" means "a div that is a descendant of the current node"
[2015-03-13 10:31:16] jleyba: "./div" means "a div that is an immediate child of the current node"
[2015-03-13 10:33:40] KostyaSha: btw http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/ better use LTS versions

[2015-03-13 11:12:04] simonstewart: lukeis: I think that's the way I'd like to keep them, with GC forever behind, but still valid
[2015-03-13 11:12:07] ato: jleyba: Nothing.
[2015-03-13 11:12:28] jleyba: simonstewart, what button is that?
[2015-03-13 11:12:41] ato: jleyba: But they're useful for categorising labels by colour/topic when you open the labels-dropdown.
[2015-03-13 11:12:47] simonstewart: There's one in the admin interface
[2015-03-13 11:12:57] simonstewart: Hopefully with enough hand waving, they'll get the idea
[2015-03-13 11:13:13] ato: jleyba: For example when I hit "l" to open the labelling box, I can then type "R-" to get everything related to reviews.
[2015-03-13 11:13:26] ato: jleyba: Instead of a list of labels ordered alphabetically.
[2015-03-13 11:13:36] ato: I'm documenting this right now in CONTRIBUTING.md.
[2015-03-13 11:15:06] jleyba: simonstewart, email sent

[2015-03-13 16:39:51] daemon: lukeis, yeah I am going to give it a whirl
[2015-03-13 16:39:55] daemon: xpath sure is useful
[2015-03-13 16:39:59] daemon: but it seems very slow
[2015-03-13 16:43:03] daemon: lukeis, of master opf css-searchs could I replace this by css as well: 	IWebElement team_container = game.FindElement(By.XPath("./div[1]"));
[2015-03-13 16:43:17] daemon: the div's availible are neither id'd nor class'd

[2015-03-13 16:44:17] lukeis: xpath should be your last resort
[2015-03-13 16:44:20] lukeis: not first ;)
[2015-03-13 16:44:38] daemon: lukeis, because the 'home page' for this site there was no css choice
[2015-03-13 16:44:43] daemon: auto generated, dynamic id/class
[2015-03-13 16:44:46] daemon: and ultra nested

[2015-03-13 16:46:17] daemon: lukeis, what do you do with css for stuff like this though:
[2015-03-13 16:46:18] daemon: IWebElement details_container = game.FindElement(By.XPath("./div[2]"));
[2015-03-13 16:46:51] daemon: I think css3 had a way to name the nth child
[2015-03-13 16:46:52] daemon: hmm
[2015-03-13 16:46:52] lukeis: game.FindElements(By.TagName("div")).get(1) ?
[2015-03-13 16:47:08] lukeis: or however you index a collection
[2015-03-13 16:47:20] *lukeis doesn't do c# :)'
[2015-03-13 16:47:22] daemon: lukeis, thats returning a list and simply pulling the second result though, would that still be faster than the xpath
[2015-03-13 16:47:39] lukeis: may or may not be
[2015-03-13 16:47:47] daemon: there massive divs, thousands of childs
[2015-03-13 16:48:02] daemon: hmm
[2015-03-13 16:48:11] lukeis: trade-offs abound :)
[2015-03-13 16:48:12] daemon: wonder if that css3 select by nth thing did come in
[2015-03-13 16:48:14] daemon: time for a google
[2015-03-13 16:48:46] lukeis: performance is dependent on *your* DOM tree… google won't help you except anecdotally
[2015-03-13 16:49:01] daemon: actually considering I am taking both div[1] and div[2] from that particular 'game' I could just loop on elements('div')
[2015-03-13 16:49:33] daemon: think its time for some test cases and time tests

[2015-03-13 17:39:54] sevaseva: AutomatedTester: Hey - sorry just noticed your ping! No, that proposal actually orthogonal to augmentation in Java. All those 3 interfaces are NOT being augmented (some of them were in the past). Things are augmented based on capabilities, but those 3 interfaces are MUST have features and don't have corresponding capabilities at this time.
[2015-03-13 17:40:23] AutomatedTester: sevaseva: ah
[2015-03-13 17:40:31] AutomatedTester: sevaseva: I am +1 anyway

[2015-03-13 17:40:45] sevaseva: AutomatedTester: thank you! :)
[2015-03-13 17:41:19] AutomatedTester: sevaseva: I thought screenshot needed to go through the augmentor unless you were doing tight binding
[2015-03-13 17:43:17] sevaseva: AutomatedTester: that used to be true. but a year+ ago, after we decided at the W3C that taking screenshots is a must have for the standard, Simon landed 4555973c520c3b9bdc552e6bd4bf1d8ef7c497be and made augmentation unnecessary
[2015-03-13 17:44:00] sevaseva: but that still didn't extend the interface
[2015-03-13 17:44:54] sevaseva: so people still need to do casting if they have WebDriver interface. that's what I propose to end
[2015-03-13 17:45:26] AutomatedTester: sevaseva: casting things seems a lot more expensive and unintuitive compared to getting unhandled exceptions
[2015-03-13 17:45:42] AutomatedTester: that people can then handle
[2015-03-13 17:45:55] AutomatedTester: but i rarely do Java so maybe I just dont get it
[2015-03-13 17:46:17] sevaseva: I personally don't have strong opinion on this one. I see reason behind both opinions

[2015-03-13 17:50:05] sevaseva: background story - I tried to promote using capabilities (over other methods specific to the internal infrastructure) to detect browser type/features. But (and most users use Java here) just couldn't do it - casting is too ugly etc
[2015-03-13 17:50:36] AutomatedTester: I agree casting is ugly and clunky
[2015-03-13 17:51:42] sevaseva: Certain for things you want people to do a lot... Casting is not appropriate
