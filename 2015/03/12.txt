[2015-03-12 08:28:12] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: sounds sucky

[2015-03-12 09:44:04] lukeis: they have a "github exporter tool"
[2015-03-12 09:44:31] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: was just about to say
[2015-03-12 09:44:34] WhereIsMySpoon: exports issues too
[2015-03-12 09:44:49] lukeis: heh, not sure we want to export those ;)
[2015-03-12 09:45:30] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: you said that was the main blocker last time
[2015-03-12 09:45:41] ato: We want to export them probably, but to close them all.
[2015-03-12 09:45:57] ato: I'm very much in favour of declaring issue bankruptcy.
[2015-03-12 09:47:42] lukeis: ato: your tweet was too generic, you needed to call the bearded one out like i did ;)
[2015-03-12 09:47:57] ato: Simon Simon Simon
[2015-03-12 09:48:34] ato: I refuse to move to hg if he's suggesting that.
[2015-03-12 09:48:41] antsanto: For this issue: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=3752. I'm trying to use html2Canvas.js and convert the entire document to canvas and getting the url of it and then get the image. Provided I work a patch for this issue, the approach that I'm taking here is correct?
[2015-03-12 09:49:34] ato: We're deprecating taking screenshots of the full DOM, so I wouldn't waste any time on this.
[2015-03-12 09:49:49] ato: But yeah, painting the document to canvas seems like the right path.
[2015-03-12 09:50:32] antsanto: ato: deprecating why?
[2015-03-12 09:50:59] ato: Because full page screenshots is a fictional concept and not something we can reliably support across UAs.
[2015-03-12 09:51:54] antsanto: Hmmm that is true. So in the up coming spec screenshot api is been deprecated ?
[2015-03-12 09:52:08] *lukeis doesn't care about full page screenshots… also they are a fantasy since no one can ever really see it :)'
[2015-03-12 09:52:31] *sircapsalot does /me work?'
[2015-03-12 09:52:33] ato: antsanto: It's going to say that we return a screenshot of the visible viewport, if it doesn't already.
[2015-03-12 09:52:51] sircapsalot: sorry to interject. ;)
[2015-03-12 09:53:10] ato: antsanto: That said, we're probably not going to remove the ability to take a full document screenshot from Firefox.
[2015-03-12 09:53:27] antsanto: ato: Oh I was working on this issue for an patch. :(
[2015-03-12 09:53:28] ato: antsanto: So we'll probably move that to become a proprietary extension to WebDriver.
[2015-03-12 09:53:45] antsanto: ato: That sounds interesting as well.
[2015-03-12 09:53:46] ato: Yeah, well if you do finish it I'm sure jleyba will be happy to acept it.
[2015-03-12 09:54:11] ato: But it won't be part of the official API, and isn't guaranteed to be compatible across drivers.

[2015-03-12 10:07:16] ato: I think the use of labels can help us greatly here.  This is for example the list of easy/getting started bugs in Servo: https://github.com/servo/servo/labels/E-easy
[2015-03-12 10:07:45] ato: Have we ever really done that on GC?
[2015-03-12 10:08:07] nirvdrum: The UI there is terrible.  The label colors are distracting and they don't line up.  It's just a sea of distraction.
[2015-03-12 10:08:30] nirvdrum: But, so be it.
[2015-03-12 10:08:47] ato: Right, so I'll be the last to argue that Github is the answer to all that is good and well in this world.
[2015-03-12 10:08:51] shawnknight, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-12 10:08:52] nirvdrum: We've labeled on GC, yeah.  And you can assign and CC people.
[2015-03-12 10:09:13] nirvdrum: You probably can't find it because it magically pops up once you click a text field.
[2015-03-12 10:10:02] ato: Well it had more issues.  For example that it still sends all notifications to my old work address and there's no way to fix that.
[2015-03-12 10:10:15] nirvdrum: That sucks.
[2015-03-12 10:10:28] ato: (Because it's all tied in to this semi-async integration with Google Accounts or something.)
[2015-03-12 10:11:10] nirvdrum: Having said that, my involvement has dropped off noticeably, so my vote shouldn't carry much weight.
[2015-03-12 10:12:33] bbark123: Maybe atlassian will give a free jira issue tracker to the project: https://www.atlassian.com/opensource/overview I don't know all of the details though
[2015-03-12 10:12:50] nirvdrum: bbark123: We used to have that.  It was just too onerous to admin.
[2015-03-12 10:13:06] bbark123: ah, yeah I can see that being a pain
[2015-03-12 10:13:08] nirvdrum: And there's no shortage of people that hate JIRA because they used it once 10 years ago.
[2015-03-12 10:14:14] nirvdrum: BitBucket seems like the nice middleground.  It has some of the nicer features of JIRA without the overhead.  And it ties in with the source repository.  But that would mean moving the project again, which I just don't see happening.

[2015-03-12 10:34:38] ato: Reality has changed since then.
[2015-03-12 10:34:49] lukeis: heh, resurrect the vote?!
[2015-03-12 10:35:01] lukeis: GC is no longer an option!
[2015-03-12 10:36:17] nirvdrum: jleyba: Fair enough. Selenium is just sorta carved out into sections with people responsible for each.  It has extremely poor support for that sort of ownership.  It's also terrible to try to plan anything in or really categorize issues.
[2015-03-12 10:36:45] nirvdrum: But if smart people here don't think that's likely to be a real problem, then I'm cool rolling with it.

[2015-03-12 10:39:15] lukeis: slightly off-topic… i'm in favor of splitting the ruby and python bindings into their own repos on github
[2015-03-12 10:40:36] jleyba: lukeis: don't think i would object to that (and pushing c# to its own as well)
[2015-03-12 10:40:46] Titus: what is the advantage of doing that?
[2015-03-12 10:40:58] Titus: would there still need to be submodules in the main repo? Or are we talking forks?
[2015-03-12 10:41:01] lukeis: i don't know what c#'s dependencies are… python and ruby only depend on the firefoxdriver xpi
[2015-03-12 10:41:13] lukeis: Titus: essentially forks
[2015-03-12 10:41:26] lukeis: history spliced of course to just limit the files each care about :)

[2015-03-12 10:41:47] simonstewart: yo
[2015-03-12 10:41:48] lukeis: welcome to project hosting debate day!
[2015-03-12 10:42:12] jleyba: lukeis: actually, i take it back. splitting would end up being more hassle in the long run

[2015-03-12 10:42:53] jleyba: simonstewart, oh hai!  random buck question for you: is there a way to build a src jar?
[2015-03-12 10:43:09] jleyba: simonstewart, took them long enough to post that
[2015-03-12 10:43:10] simonstewart: Yeah. //some:target#src
[2015-03-12 10:43:50] jleyba: awesome, thanks
[2015-03-12 10:44:24] simonstewart: Any care to provide a synopsis of the discussion from today?
[2015-03-12 10:44:37] jleyba: GC -> github; get 'er done
[2015-03-12 10:44:42] lukeis: :)
[2015-03-12 10:45:16] simonstewart: Not bitbucket?
[2015-03-12 10:45:25] simonstewart: I'm starting to enjoy using mercurial
[2015-03-12 10:45:30] lukeis: someone said you'd start suggesting that...
[2015-03-12 10:45:56] lukeis: you also may enjoy walks on hot coal

[2015-03-12 10:47:45] simonstewart: What's the ownership thing that nirvdrum was talking about?
[2015-03-12 10:48:20] simonstewart: Ah. Bugs in GC's issue tracker
[2015-03-12 10:48:28] simonstewart: Right then
[2015-03-12 10:48:46] simonstewart: I'll post this to the group later, but questions we need to answer:
[2015-03-12 10:48:55] simonstewart: 1) Do we port our existing issues to GC
[2015-03-12 10:49:08] simonstewart: 2) What do we do with the existing wiki?
[2015-03-12 10:49:24] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-12 10:49:35] lukeis: oh and Wiki on GC is permissioned on edits… Github is open to the world
[2015-03-12 10:49:43] simonstewart: 3) Do we want to use GC's issue tracker? I know Atlassian foks, so we could try and get an OSS JIRA hosted instance
[2015-03-12 10:50:08] simonstewart: For question 1 --- s/GC/GH/
[2015-03-12 10:50:15] jleyba: 1) declare issue bankruptcy and close it all
[2015-03-12 10:50:17] jleyba: 2) port it
[2015-03-12 10:50:23] simonstewart: I think it's a no-brainer that we'll end up on GitHub
[2015-03-12 10:50:26] Cono_, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2015-03-12 10:50:30] jleyba: 3) suck it up and use GH to keep everything in one place
[2015-03-12 10:50:54] simonstewart: 1) What happens if we close all Core and RC issues in our existing tracker?
[2015-03-12 10:51:05] lukeis: they die forever (i hope)
[2015-03-12 10:51:10] nirvdrum: simonstewart: I think you figured it out, but I meant IE bugs go to jimevans, Firefox bugs go to AutomatedTester, etc.
[2015-03-12 10:51:29] simonstewart: I mean, how many open issues would be left?
[2015-03-12 10:51:34] lukeis: lots
[2015-03-12 10:51:36] lukeis: tons even
[2015-03-12 10:51:46] lukeis: only ~20% are RC / core
[2015-03-12 10:51:58] simonstewart: We declared issue bankruptcy when we moved from JIRA to GC

[2015-03-12 10:52:48] jleyba: If we do it, I'd like us to establish an actual issue SLA documented on the wiki
[2015-03-12 10:53:00] simonstewart: Which would be?
[2015-03-12 10:53:11] lukeis: your issue may be bit-rotted ;)
[2015-03-12 10:53:13] jleyba: No more "NeedsClarification" bs. If you're issue report is vague, it gets closed
[2015-03-12 10:53:18] lukeis: +1
[2015-03-12 10:54:50] jleyba: I started one for the JS bindings: https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver#issues
[2015-03-12 10:56:07] jleyba: Guess that's not really a SLA... covers my main grievances with the current process though

[2015-03-12 11:02:06] lukeis: correct
[2015-03-12 11:02:07] simonstewart: Or "it needs doing"?
[2015-03-12 11:02:11] simonstewart: Who did that?
[2015-03-12 11:02:16] lukeis: i did

[2015-03-12 11:02:46] simonstewart: :)

[2015-03-12 11:05:56] lukeis: some more implications… do we "merge" Pull Requests through the Github UI? (allowing the 'merge' commit) or do we still employ our current process?
[2015-03-12 11:06:12] simonstewart: NO
[2015-03-12 11:06:30] simonstewart: We keep our current process, since the merges violate the single logical change principle

[2015-03-12 13:06:21] lukeis: by enough, you mean lots of links to update? :)
[2015-03-12 13:06:36] ato: What are the fixtures for?
[2015-03-12 13:06:43] ato: It downloads two HTML pages off GC.
[2015-03-12 13:06:55] lukeis: for issues?
[2015-03-12 13:07:01] ato: Yeah, apparently.
[2015-03-12 13:07:11] ato: I need to get my Ruby environment up and running to run the specs before I can do anything.
[2015-03-12 13:07:15] lukeis: yeah, that can get scraped
[2015-03-12 13:07:21] ato: Okay.
[2015-03-12 13:07:41] lukeis: that was because of google code shutting off their api's :)
[2015-03-12 13:07:56] ato: Oh, so it was curling the contents off those and parsing the HTML?
[2015-03-12 13:08:03] lukeis: yep
[2015-03-12 13:08:16] ato: Oh lord my hat.
[2015-03-12 13:08:16] jleyba: does github support serving html content straight from a repo?
[2015-03-12 13:08:23] lukeis: no
[2015-03-12 13:08:25] ato: I don't think so.
[2015-03-12 13:08:31] jleyba: so we need to set up io pages for all the api docs
[2015-03-12 13:08:37] ato: You need to push to gh-pages which exposes it on github.io.
[2015-03-12 13:08:38] lukeis: jleyba: was talking to simon about that earlier… we're going to have to use gh-pages
[2015-03-12 13:08:46] lukeis: i'll work on that if i find some time :)

[2015-03-12 13:09:36] jleyba: there is through selenium's logging API
[2015-03-12 13:09:43] ato: richardr: chromedriver exposes logging as part of the WebDriver API.

[2015-03-12 13:11:29] ato: richardr: Also see this about your original question: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/help/devtools-window-keeps-closing
[2015-03-12 13:11:42] richardr: ato: the first one I imagine is just going to log the crash STDERR which I believe I get once Selenium crashes
[2015-03-12 13:11:57] ato: richardr: Right, I linked to it before I looked at the contents.
[2015-03-12 13:11:58] richardr: second one looks really useful, not sure if it can provide me with JS debugging though, but worth a try :)
[2015-03-12 13:12:06] ato: It can.
[2015-03-12 13:12:16] ato: Just have a look at the enum; it should be in there.
[2015-03-12 13:13:05] richardr: ato: this has been immensely helpful - cheers
[2015-03-12 13:13:11] ato: np!
[2015-03-12 13:13:34] ato: richardr: FWIW FirefoxDriver exposes JS logs too if I remember correctly.
[2015-03-12 13:15:24] jleyba: ato: no
[2015-03-12 13:15:48] jleyba: it exposes it's internal logs, but hte FirefoxDriver does not capture the console API
[2015-03-12 13:16:52] richardr: jleyba: but chromedriver performance-logging will capture console API ?
[2015-03-12 13:17:00] jleyba: should
[2015-03-12 13:17:29] richardr: They mention "Timeline", "Network", and "Page", and then become a bit ambiguous around what other "trace data" it exposes
[2015-03-12 13:19:00] jleyba: richardr, oh nvm, it's just exposed via standard logging not perf
[2015-03-12 13:19:20] jleyba: see https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/node/selenium-webdriver/test/logging_test.js
[2015-03-12 13:19:43] ato: jleyba: Oh okay.
[2015-03-12 13:19:45] barancev: lukeis: is it possible to create a new issue template on GH?
[2015-03-12 13:19:57] ato: jleyba: Maybe it was the Presto-OperaDriver I implemented it for.
[2015-03-12 13:20:18] jleyba: ato, I'd be surprised if it wasn't possible. just no one has done it
[2015-03-12 13:20:35] ato: jleyba: Yes: https://github.com/operasoftware/operaprestodriver/blob/1ccceda80f1c1a0489171d17dcaa6e7b18fb4c01/src/com/opera/core/systems/scope/stp/services/messages/ConsoleLoggerMessage.java
[2015-03-12 13:20:47] lukeis: barancev: not that i'm aware of
[2015-03-12 13:20:52] ato: jleyba: Right, I'll remember to file a bug against Marionette about it.
[2015-03-12 13:20:57] ato: jleyba: It's fairly easy.
[2015-03-12 13:21:33] ato: There probably are more important things to tackle first though.
[2015-03-12 13:21:35] jleyba: ato, honestly i wouldn't bother until the logging api is finalized (since simon keeps promising to update it)
[2015-03-12 13:21:36] ato: Like compatibility.
[2015-03-12 13:21:43] ato: Exactly.
[2015-03-12 13:22:08] ato: Usually it's the case that he who codes wins though.
[2015-03-12 13:25:44] barancev: ok, what is RC-related issue policy?
[2015-03-12 13:25:52] barancev: 1) do we accept new isues on RC?
[2015-03-12 13:26:00] lukeis: No More RC!
[2015-03-12 13:26:06] barancev: 2) do we keep open old issues on RC?
[2015-03-12 13:26:06] lukeis: deprecated, close immediately

[2015-03-12 13:39:20] ato: Well there was some consensus. What Google came up with on the end, the idea of deprecation of messages etc. was quite good.
[2015-03-12 13:39:30] ato: That was implemented by Google and Opera.
[2015-03-12 13:41:06] AutomatedTester: ato: was this pre Cambridge talks?
[2015-03-12 13:41:42] ato: Much earlier. More like 2012 I think.
[2015-03-12 13:42:06] AutomatedTester: ok, then Google had changed their mind quite considerably from then

[2015-03-12 13:42:47] ato: They changed their mind a lot during development, ie the interfaces changes frequently.
[2015-03-12 13:42:52] AutomatedTester: and part of that was implemented with the perf logging
[2015-03-12 13:43:02] ato: This was before the spec was conceived.

[2015-03-12 14:58:52] Firebolt227: Hey, this is my first time of freenode. Is there anyone that has any experience with using Selenium on sites with Modal popup windows?
[2015-03-12 14:59:21] rochadt: welcome firebolt!
[2015-03-12 14:59:56] Firebolt227: Hey rochadt
[2015-03-12 15:00:13] AutomatedTester: Firebolt227: :ask away
[2015-03-12 15:01:11] Conio: I'm working along the premise that methods of page objects should not return voids but rather they should return page objects themselves
[2015-03-12 15:01:38] Conio: for example, a method to navigate to a page should return an object of type "page object"
[2015-03-12 15:01:50] lukeis: Conio: i'm in that camp, i don't believe any page object method should ever return a void
[2015-03-12 15:02:02] Conio: thi should allegedly allow method chaining and a more fluent interface
[2015-03-12 15:02:14] Firebolt227: How, do I get Selenium to interface with Modal popup windows? I need to interface with a log-in window that's a modal popup.
[2015-03-12 15:02:29] Conio: hello lukeis...i've started along that route
[2015-03-12 15:02:34] lukeis: Conio: fluency has a trade off… debuggability in the stack traces :)
[2015-03-12 15:02:54] lukeis: especially if there's a dreaded NPE ;)
[2015-03-12 15:03:01] Conio: but I find that approach is really limiting the usability of having a base page object class
[2015-03-12 15:03:17] Conio: my navigateTo method has a different return type every time
[2015-03-12 15:03:38] lukeis: i like base page object class typically is just an interface with no methods
[2015-03-12 15:03:39] lukeis: :)
[2015-03-12 15:03:40] Conio: true, there's a trade off...NPE?
[2015-03-12 15:03:42] dude-x: i had tests in Java using page object model, never used fluent style
[2015-03-12 15:03:51] lukeis: Null Pointer Exception
[2015-03-12 15:03:56] Conio: ah
[2015-03-12 15:04:02] Conio: no methods at all?
[2015-03-12 15:04:21] dude-x: no chaining methods in the tests
[2015-03-12 15:04:29] lukeis: correct, i don't think there's anything generic enough to say it will exist on every single page
[2015-03-12 15:04:59] AutomatedTester: Firebolt227: do you mean modal?
[2015-03-12 15:05:17] dude-x: loginPage.loginUser("Blah", "secret"); assertTrue("Welcome Blah", homePage.getWelcomeBannerText())
[2015-03-12 15:05:19] Conio: i guess it really depends on UAT at hand...for example for my UAT...every single page has a log out link that always takes the user to the login page...
[2015-03-12 15:05:23] AutomatedTester: Firebolt227: is it 2 modals, one for username and one for password?
[2015-03-12 15:05:37] Firebolt227: AutomatedTester: Yes. Modal. Sorry. Typing fast.
[2015-03-12 15:06:22] Conio: dude-x, I see...thanks
[2015-03-12 15:06:39] lukeis: Conio: does the login page have a logout link? :)
[2015-03-12 15:06:40] swypych, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-12 15:06:40] Conio: so not a fan of returning page object types from your methods?
[2015-03-12 15:06:59] Conio: he he, actually no lukeis, it doesn't
[2015-03-12 15:07:21] Firebolt227: AutomatesTester: No. It's just one model with two text fields for username and password and a submit button.
[2015-03-12 15:07:26] Conio: my application is actually 2 applications, a portal application front end that then allows you to access my intended application
[2015-03-12 15:07:37] dude-x: Conio: i thought it was a neat idea when i found out that people did this, but i also felt (Without even knowing about the stacktrace issue) that it will make it harder to write easy to read tests
[2015-03-12 15:07:43] Conio: but in reality, with the exception of the login page, all the other ones do
[2015-03-12 15:08:08] Conio: so in that case the login page would be on it's own..not inheriting from anything perhaps
[2015-03-12 15:08:13] lukeis: I've made a LoggedIn Page object that 'most' things extend from before...
[2015-03-12 15:08:23] dude-x: I didn't set well with me to write something like "loginPage.enterUsername("blah").enterPassword("secret").clickSubmit();
[2015-03-12 15:09:19] dude-x: also some of my page objects were shared components that can return different "pages"
[2015-03-12 15:09:23] lukeis: Conio: but typically I like a different way of composing "Widgets" on pages for reusable components that exist… like LogoutWidget… and every page that has it would have reference to that widget
[2015-03-12 15:09:29] Conio: i see your point dude-x..oddly enough, the advise is that by reutrning page object types...the tests are supposed to be EASIER to read and write
[2015-03-12 15:09:50] dude-x: but imagine a team of people who have their own ideas...
[2015-03-12 15:10:03] dude-x: then i would have to weep at code reviews
[2015-03-12 15:10:14] Conio: lukeis, yes...I've come across that issue...composing is new to me so I'm a little leery....but yes
[2015-03-12 15:10:21] Conio: I think I will eventually have to go that route
[2015-03-12 15:10:49] Conio: my UAT has a different menu for each business year that it has existed for
[2015-03-12 15:10:51] dimacus, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-03-12 15:10:58] Conio: so my menu changes from year to year
[2015-03-12 15:11:22] Conio: so I may have to go the composing way...and have a page object for each year's menu

[2015-03-12 15:11:33] Conio: talk about kludgy in my opinion
[2015-03-12 15:11:53] dude-x: i don't see any issue in having page objects derive from a base page object
[2015-03-12 15:11:55] Conio: so if you have a completely empty interface...what do you really gain?
[2015-03-12 15:12:08] dude-x: the base page object should just have functions that should be available to any page object
[2015-03-12 15:12:25] dude-x: some people wrap the selenium library in the base page object (At least in dynamic languages)

[2015-03-12 15:13:01] Conio: dude-x, that's the idea...and at first I thought...how neat!! I don't have to keep rewriting the same code....alas, slowly as my framework is maturing...i find myself "pulling" code out of my base class

[2015-03-12 15:14:24] dude-x: in my present test suite, i keep my wrapper to selenium separate from the base page object; the base object only provides convenience functions like string formatting, data structure maniupulation, functions to open files

[2015-03-12 15:15:19] Conio: oh...interesting dude-x...hadn't thought about bundling up my "utils functions" into the base page object
[2015-03-12 15:15:58] ato: There was Lohengrin at the Coliseum as well as in Oslo which would've been fun to compare, as well as your wife's concert.
[2015-03-12 15:16:20] dude-x: like i said, the base page object should have methods/functions that every page object should have access to so that it makes it easier to write a page object
[2015-03-12 15:16:21] Conio: but why not...if it's something any page object can use or might use...why create a separate Utility class for it...
[2015-03-12 15:16:26] dude-x: not every util function should belong there
[2015-03-12 15:17:04] ato: AutomatedTester: I did see Placido Domingo conduct (!) at Covent Garden though.  You can tell your wife it was pretty terrible. (-:
[2015-03-12 15:17:20] dude-x: at a prior project, the utility class just had functions that helped group some UI actions into convenience functions
[2015-03-12 15:17:24] Conio: true...I guess originally I thought you meant only the methods/functions/services provided by the pages themselves
[2015-03-12 15:17:32] merobertsjr, quitting. (Quit: Be back later ...)
[2015-03-12 15:17:53] dude-x: the way i write page objects is that there are two categories of functions
[2015-03-12 15:18:22] Conio: thank you very much for all this advise dude-x...much appreciated

[2015-03-12 15:18:41] AutomatedTester: ato: will do
[2015-03-12 15:18:52] dude-x: an "atomic" function that does one thing well, like "click a button", "type some text"; and convenience functions that group all the atomic functions; ex: loginAsUser would have typeInUserName(), typeinPassword(), clickSubmit()
[2015-03-12 15:18:53] AutomatedTester: ato: their current principle conductor is really good

[2015-03-12 15:20:16] AutomatedTester: ato: before that was Marin Alsop
[2015-03-12 15:21:10] dude-x: page objects have locators, and methods to interact with the page
[2015-03-12 15:21:13] emperorcezar, joining. (#selenium)

[2015-03-12 15:21:19] dude-x: that's an important division
[2015-03-12 15:21:20] Conio: dude-x, so your page object methods mostly return void types?
[2015-03-12 15:21:25] dude-x: Yes.
[2015-03-12 15:21:29] operatiay, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2015-03-12 15:21:36] dude-x: and String
[2015-03-12 15:21:57] ato: AutomatedTester: Oh I thought you meant the Royal Opera House.
[2015-03-12 15:22:03] dude-x: and integers sometimes (count the number of rows of stuff)
[2015-03-12 15:22:14] Conio: right, just basic types
[2015-03-12 15:22:22] Conio: never page object types?
[2015-03-12 15:22:37] dude-x: It might makes sense to occasionally return a page object type
[2015-03-12 15:22:39] ato: AutomatedTester: I will listen to him tomorrow.
[2015-03-12 15:22:53] AutomatedTester: ato: my wife likes him as a conductor
[2015-03-12 15:22:59] ato: That's important, I think.
[2015-03-12 15:23:12] dude-x: Conio: my assumption is that if you're writing tests that you know the outcome 100% of the time, no need
[2015-03-12 15:23:36] dude-x: if you need to do some non-test automation, then that could be really useful
[2015-03-12 15:24:08] Conio: well, sort of...yes mostly, but not always...what if upon login the test gets redirected to the "time to change your password" page...
[2015-03-12 15:24:21] dude-x: ah so things like that
[2015-03-12 15:24:34] dude-x: your application should have test hooks to disable that kind of thing
[2015-03-12 15:24:37] ato: Your test scenario needs to cater for that eventuality.
[2015-03-12 15:24:38] dude-x: or to override
[2015-03-12 15:24:50] ato: Or you need to disable that eventuality in your testing.
[2015-03-12 15:25:09] ato: (Which of course distances your testing from reality.)
[2015-03-12 15:25:39] dude-x: another alternative is working with a database that is always consistent
[2015-03-12 15:25:53] Conio: hmn...food for thought; not sure how I would override such...perhaps navigating by URL...not sure
[2015-03-12 15:25:54] operatiay, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-12 15:26:17] ato: Make it an optional maybe?
[2015-03-12 15:26:19] dude-x: sometimes URL works /login?disable_password_check=True
[2015-03-12 15:26:31] ato: Login action returns an optional of A or B.

[2015-03-12 15:27:14] Conio: okay, now you guys are getting fancy on me ;)
[2015-03-12 15:27:15] dude-x: test hooks are a nice thing; the application says something like "if user = "X" disable password check"
[2015-03-12 15:27:24] ato: Conio: What language are you in?
[2015-03-12 15:27:29] Conio: c#
[2015-03-12 15:28:14] ato: Okay, I don't know C#, but I'm sure there's a way to have the login method return either type A or B, or an interface they both implement.
[2015-03-12 15:28:53] ato: Or have the login action always return some structure that tells you what happened and which lets you retrieve the actual page object that happened.

[2015-03-12 15:29:51] Conio: ato, sorry over my head...but I get the gist of what you mean...that would certainly be a "future" task
[2015-03-12 15:30:22] Conio: maybe something handled by someone else since I'm already thinking I won't be at this shop much longer...sadly
[2015-03-12 15:30:29] Firebolt227: Okay, I got some people in the office to help me out with my model popups. Thanks everyone!
[2015-03-12 15:30:33] Firebolt227, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2015-03-12 15:30:51] ato: Your problem is that logging in might cause the webapp to navigate to an expected page, or a “time to change your password” page right?
[2015-03-12 15:31:03] Conio: yeah
[2015-03-12 15:31:05] ato: That conflicts with the entire idea of statical typing.
[2015-03-12 15:31:20] ato: s/statical/strong/
[2015-03-12 15:31:22] Conio: true
[2015-03-12 15:31:47] ato: So you need an abstraction which lets you query what was the outcome, and let you get the actual page object.
[2015-03-12 15:32:12] Conio: but even if I return voids yet my test expects to have made it to a certain page but instead is sitting at the "change password" page...regardless, the test will time out and fail
[2015-03-12 15:32:42] Conio: true, in theory I understand what you mean ato
[2015-03-12 15:32:44] ato: Either DashboardPage (assuming this is what you normally end up at) and ChangePasswordPage share the same interface, and you have the login routine return that interface, in which case you can do an instance test to see which it is.
[2015-03-12 15:33:05] Conio: ah, I see
[2015-03-12 15:33:15] Conio: something like IPortalPage
[2015-03-12 15:33:34] ato: Or you need to return a different class entirely which has a property that tells you which page you landed on.
[2015-03-12 15:33:54] Conio: then figure out in my code which specific page I'm at...so the IPortalPage needs to have some kind of "which page am I" method?
[2015-03-12 15:34:37] ato: Exactly.
[2015-03-12 15:34:39] ato: That's one way.
[2015-03-12 15:35:08] ato: My only worry about this sort of approach is that it offloads a lot of logic to the class hierarchy which can make things difficult to reason about.
[2015-03-12 15:35:08] Conio: but by def'n..an Interface can't have any defined methods...or something like that
[2015-03-12 15:35:46] ato: Well if two classes share the same interface you can use the interface as the return type, and do an instance test to check exactly which concrete class they implement.
[2015-03-12 15:36:13] Conio: hmn, so an IPortalBase Page...then an abstract PortalBasePage that implements the interface...
[2015-03-12 15:36:29] ato: Yeah.
[2015-03-12 15:36:40] Conio: awesome stuff ato!
[2015-03-12 15:36:56] Conio: but yeah, I think someone else will do that :)
[2015-03-12 15:37:12] Conio: right now I'm under the gun to "make sure every page" loads
[2015-03-12 15:37:33] richardr, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-12 15:37:45] Conio: but I do get the intent of what you are saying...seems sensical to me
[2015-03-12 15:39:41] Conio: mind you I think I've strayed from my original question...to use or not abstract base page objects
[2015-03-12 15:39:58] Conio: I know the general advise is yes, do it
[2015-03-12 15:40:14] dude-x: well you should have concrete base page objects
[2015-03-12 15:40:30] Conio: but slowly it seems I am "gutting" my base page object'd code/methods
[2015-03-12 15:40:52] dude-x: abstract might make sense if you want to enforce some basic methods like navigate, but i see no point really
[2015-03-12 15:41:35] dude-x: because a page object may actually be a "component" like some widget that's shared on many pages
[2015-03-12 15:41:38] Conio: right, and so far my nagivateTo method is diff't for every page since I'm abstracting out the Menu widget
[2015-03-12 15:41:59] ato: So what we're talking about here is theoretically called covariant return types.
[2015-03-12 15:42:14] Conio: right, i came across something about that ato
[2015-03-12 15:42:23] Conio: never heard about it 'til 2 days ago

[2015-03-12 15:42:35] ato: Basically it's a role-based interface that lets you cast one type to another with richer methods because you know what it is.
