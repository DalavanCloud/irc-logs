[2015-03-25 11:23:24] lukeis: cristi: not necessarily… only the grid hub does
[2015-03-25 11:24:07] cristi: I'm running tests against a hub where the nodes are private and I get timeouts for all the tests
[2015-03-25 11:24:57] cristi: but I'll look into it in more detail tomorrow
[2015-03-25 11:25:06] lukeis: the nodes also need access to the AUT (application under test) :)

[2015-03-25 11:27:52] dude-x, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-03-25 11:27:56] isonic1_: is there a grid hub setting to delay requests sent to nodes?
[2015-03-25 11:28:23] cristi: the setup is using an AWS VPC, the hub does NAT for the nodes, is whitelisted on the app side and is in a public subnet, and the nodes are in a private subnet and only reachable from the hub
[2015-03-25 11:29:28] cristi: from the nodes if I use a browser I can open the app under test without any issues

[2015-03-25 11:33:18] lukeis: cristi: have you confirmed both directions of communication between nodes and gird hub (aka node can talk to hub, hub can talk to node)
[2015-03-25 11:35:21] cristi: from nodes I can register and open the hub web interface on port 4444
[2015-03-25 11:36:06] lukeis: do the nodes stay alive after 5 minutes? (aka, hub doesn't auto disconnect them cause it can't get the status from them)
[2015-03-25 11:36:07] cristi: and from the hub I can open the selenium running on the nodes and listening on 5555
[2015-03-25 11:36:24] lukeis: ok, sounds good there :)

[2015-03-25 12:59:46] lukeis: git commit --amend -s    does the trick

[2015-03-25 13:03:38] sircapsalot: for the selenium repo, could you share your `git remote -v`, where it shows pr/371?  i'm so curious. i've never used the signoff before
[2015-03-25 13:03:50] sircapsalot: is it just their repo?
[2015-03-25 13:04:49] lukeis: add this to your .git/config  -   fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*    (under your github remote)
[2015-03-25 13:05:14] lukeis: the signoff is just something we do
[2015-03-25 13:05:27] lukeis: well, the linux kernel does it too
[2015-03-25 13:06:04] lukeis: it's to show *who* signed off on merging the commit into the repo that has access to update the 'main' repo
[2015-03-25 13:06:20] sircapsalot: yea, after that SCO vs IBM lawsuit or whatever
[2015-03-25 13:07:12] lukeis: ato: doesn't that merge leave you with a merge commit though? (in that command)

[2015-03-25 13:08:00] lukeis: then you pull after the merge? not before?
[2015-03-25 13:08:05] ato: Can't remember which of them affects it.
[2015-03-25 13:08:17] ato: Also it's a fast-forward as long as there are no commits on master in between.
[2015-03-25 13:08:32] ato: I pull before the merge.
[2015-03-25 13:08:46] lukeis: not sure what the autosetuprebase does… will need to look it up
[2015-03-25 13:09:13] ato: It tells new branches that they should be configured to always rebase.
[2015-03-25 13:09:29] ato: So a test with 70 % pass rate is Good Enough right?
[2015-03-25 13:09:43] lukeis: huh?
[2015-03-25 13:10:48] sircapsalot: very cool.. thanks for that guys.  got it working :)
[2015-03-25 13:11:15] lukeis: ato: ok… so you're working because of that autosetuprebase, because the pull request is pulled in as a branch and you are auto-rebasing it
[2015-03-25 13:11:16] sircapsalot: i gist'ed it so i wont forget.  (not sure what i'd do without gist)
[2015-03-25 13:11:38] ato: lukeis: I can't remember these things, I thought it worked because there were no commits made to master in between.
[2015-03-25 13:11:48] ato: lukeis: So it's a fast-forward merge.
[2015-03-25 13:12:00] lukeis: o.0
[2015-03-25 13:12:12] lukeis: i'll just stick with using cherry-pick like i normally do ;)

[2015-03-25 13:13:44] lukeis: yeah, i don't normally see the Fast-forward on a merge… feels like you have another setting
[2015-03-25 13:14:16] ato: OK, so it's probably because the master branch has "rebase" set to true.
[2015-03-25 13:14:26] ato: So it's not actually a merge, but a rebase.
[2015-03-25 13:14:51] ato: And branch.autosetuprebase set to always sets "rebase" on every new branch entry to true.
[2015-03-25 13:15:45] lukeis: the minutiae of git ;)
[2015-03-25 13:15:58] ato: My Selenium .git/config: https://gist.github.com/andreastt/59fb066fef61067ccf1b
[2015-03-25 13:16:18] ato: lukeis: Sorry about the confusion.  Basically I've configured my git to always do rebases of everything.

[2015-03-25 14:48:07] dude-x: however
[2015-03-25 14:48:32] dude-x: if you have control of the code, there is a thing that you can hook into your flash objects that can expose javascript controls
[2015-03-25 14:48:34] dude-x: then you can automate
[2015-03-25 14:49:45] SeleniumUser: we use third party vendor vidoes that are rendered as part of the webpage itself. But do not have any specific control on the object itself.
