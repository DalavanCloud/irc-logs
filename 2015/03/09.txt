[2015-03-09 08:55:08] lukeis: Lope: what's the difference between a tab and a new window?
[2015-03-09 08:55:23] Lope: same thing, Either one will work.
[2015-03-09 08:55:39] lukeis: ok, new window:   driver.execute_script("window.open()")
[2015-03-09 08:55:42] Lope: but it must share the same session as the original. So the original can login, and other tabs/windows can operate on the site.
[2015-03-09 08:56:53] Lope: lukeis: thanks, will explore this.
[2015-03-09 08:57:06] Lope: I need to do it with WebdriverJS
[2015-03-09 08:57:22] lukeis: there should be an execute script method available :)
[2015-03-09 08:57:35] lukeis: :api
[2015-03-09 08:57:45] Lope: yeah but then I need to also switch focus to each of the windows and access them

[2015-03-09 08:58:44] Lope: just as a user can read text in multiple windows shown on the screen without constantly switching focus.
[2015-03-09 08:58:45] lukeis: can't do that, you need to switch to them

[2015-03-09 08:59:46] Lope: this SO says switching to windows is not as reliable as running window.focus inside the desired window.
[2015-03-09 08:59:48] Dave_B_: when reading two windows the user is switching *their* focus to them, if not the OSs focus :p

[2015-03-09 09:11:57] rocket: hrmm so what is the best recommendation for improving overall speed when using selenium.  I was hoping to get decent speed with htmlunit and grid2 but even that seems slow .. eg just querying 4 pages is taking quite a while.
[2015-03-09 09:13:03] eindoofus: hi, can anyone please explain what this C# line means? I don't see 'd' defined or assigned anywhere:   wait.Until((d) => { return d.Title.StartsWith("selenium"); });
[2015-03-09 09:13:14] lukeis: rocket: try phantomjs also?  and selenium isn't the greatest tool if you care a lot about speed of execution
[2015-03-09 09:13:49] eindoofus: i believe it's one of those lambda things.. but what is passing the 'd'?
[2015-03-09 09:13:50] lukeis: eindoofus: the first "d" should be the "driver" instance, aka an instance of WebDriver
[2015-03-09 09:14:04] jimevans: eindoofus: it's a lambda function, also called an anonymous method. the Until method takes a function as an argument. that function must itself take an argument of type IWebDriver. the compiler knows all this.
[2015-03-09 09:14:06] lukeis: in the .Until
[2015-03-09 09:14:12] rocket: lukeis: I had a feeling, but I have customers who dont want to use twill to monitor their app because the javascript support lacks .. so I was hoping I might get something workable with grid2 but who knows
[2015-03-09 09:14:38] jimevans: eindoofus: so it's defining the variable 'd' as the argument to the lambda function.
[2015-03-09 09:15:04] eindoofus: the IWebDriver is defined as 'driver' in this example though, and not 'd'
[2015-03-09 09:15:17] lukeis: eindoofus: look at the construction of the "wait" variable
[2015-03-09 09:15:21] lukeis: for where it's defined
[2015-03-09 09:15:47] jimevans: eindoofus:  not in the scope of the internal function it's not. this is a standard lambda usage construct for c#
[2015-03-09 09:15:54] SitamJana, quitting. (Quit: SitamJana)
[2015-03-09 09:17:13] *lukeis quite amused by the choice of handles too :)'
[2015-03-09 09:20:08] eindoofus: i see that "new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));" is what's assigned to 'wait', does this mean that 'wait' uses it's 'driver' reference for 'd'? there is nothing that mentions this in "Until<TResult>" as far as i can tell: https://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/dotnet/html/AllMembers_T_OpenQA_Selenium_Support_UI_WebDriverWait.htm
[2015-03-09 09:21:14] eindoofus: nevermind, it does mention 'function'. still unsure about the 'd' though
[2015-03-09 09:21:29] lukeis: the "d" can be whatever you want it to be
[2015-03-09 09:21:41] lukeis: could have called it "x" or "eindoofus"â€¦ doesn't matter
[2015-03-09 09:21:48] lukeis: lookup C# lambda
[2015-03-09 09:22:43] eindoofus: i mostly understand that part but "Repeatedly applies this instance's input value to the given function until one of the following occurs". It's the "input" that's confusing me. A lambda needs some input but where does it come from?
[2015-03-09 09:23:08] lukeis: it's the driver that you gave the constructor of the Wait
[2015-03-09 09:23:33] eindoofus: how could one derive that from the documentation?: https://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/dotnet/html/AllMembers_T_OpenQA_Selenium_Support_UI_WebDriverWait.htm
[2015-03-09 09:23:54] lukeis: i concur, it's not clear there :)
[2015-03-09 09:23:55] jimevans: eindoofus: assume the documentation writer doesn't know what the hell he's doing.
[2015-03-09 09:24:03] lukeis: :api
[2015-03-09 09:24:09] eindoofus: lol. good, i'm not crazy then

[2015-03-09 09:25:03] eindoofus: it's my bad. i need to learn to communicate this stuff better
[2015-03-09 09:25:38] lukeis: it's because the abstraction was copied from Java, and in Java the WebDriverWait extends a FluentWait, which constructor takes an "input" and so javadoc refers to it as "input"

[2015-03-09 09:47:26] lukeis: rocket: nice :)
[2015-03-09 09:48:25] lukeis: Lope: if you use firefox, you'd have to do some firefox profile mangling to do that, but possibly possibleâ€¦
[2015-03-09 09:49:27] AutomatedTester: Lope: an already running Firefox?
[2015-03-09 09:49:36] Lope: AutomatedTester: yeah
[2015-03-09 09:49:51] Lope: just considering all the options
[2015-03-09 09:49:59] AutomatedTester: Lope: we dont currently support it so it requires a lot of hacking to get it working
[2015-03-09 09:50:12] AutomatedTester: fwiw, the next version of FirefoxDriver has this feature built in
[2015-03-09 09:50:27] Lope: okay, no worries. How well supported is opening a new window and switching between windows?
[2015-03-09 09:50:33] dude-x: really?
[2015-03-09 09:50:50] dude-x: you can now hook into an existing firefox instance and use webdriver commands?

[2015-03-09 09:51:34] AutomatedTester: as long as firefox was started in a specific way you can tap into it
[2015-03-09 09:51:45] rocket: When is that support coming out roughly?
[2015-03-09 09:51:52] AutomatedTester: *soon*
[2015-03-09 09:51:54] dude-x: that makes sense
[2015-03-09 09:52:00] lukeis: dude-x: i do it with python (with local hacks) ;)
[2015-03-09 09:52:03] rocket: eg will that save time since you dont have to start the process?
[2015-03-09 09:52:08] AutomatedTester: working though bugs
[2015-03-09 09:52:32] rocket: and/or will that work for a grid2 env?
[2015-03-09 09:52:43] dude-x: lukeis: impressive; that means you would have to have the webdriver extension running though right
[2015-03-09 09:52:56] AutomatedTester: rocket: it will work in the same way that ChromeDriver/IEDriver works
[2015-03-09 09:53:19] AutomatedTester: but if you tell it to use an already started Firefox it will look on a specific port for Firefox
[2015-03-09 09:53:22] rocket: ok so I assume thats why Chrome was about 3 seconds faster in my testing ..
[2015-03-09 09:53:38] lukeis: dude-x: my use caseâ€¦ start a test via javaâ€¦ set breakpointâ€¦ want to interactively interact and I hate eclipse debugging and executing there, so, python replâ€¦ all that's needed is a new constructor that takes an session id, and doesn't call the 'new session' remote endpoint
[2015-03-09 09:53:56] AutomatedTester: rocket: Firefox starts up twice during initialisation
[2015-03-09 09:54:03] AutomatedTester: in webdriver
[2015-03-09 09:54:18] dude-x: lukeis: i see. not too hard but clever
[2015-03-09 09:54:18] AutomatedTester: to make sure the browser is in a good state after we hacked together a profile

[2015-03-09 10:05:12] ato: akafred: You'll probably need to write the code yourself.  But it's not an unattainable goal, there are plenty of examples in existing bindings.

[2015-03-09 10:08:16] dgempesaw: out of curiosity, why can't/don't you want to use the server? afaik, all that the other bindings do is handle downloading and starting it on their own - it's not actually _without_ the server

[2015-03-09 14:53:20] jliberman: hi selenium, I am trying to write a script for a site that uses $.ajax with async: false making it a syncronous request. I know, WTF right? Anyway, elements that get added to the DOM by the callback of that syncronous request can't be clicked because Displayed is = false even after the element is clearly visible.
[2015-03-09 14:53:58] jliberman: do I need to make it re-parse the DOM somehow or something like that?

[2015-03-09 14:57:22] AutomatedTester: jliberman: is the element in question in via css transforms?
[2015-03-09 14:58:06] AutomatedTester: lukeis: in reality I am worried that the new macbook pros might be going dual core
[2015-03-09 14:58:20] AutomatedTester: to make the battery last longer
[2015-03-09 14:59:43] lukeis: I'm sure they wouldn't make the mbp's not capable of building xcode / ios itself ;)
[2015-03-09 15:00:06] lukeis: at least not without lots of in-fighting
[2015-03-09 15:01:22] jliberman: AutomatedTester: I didn't think to look. Doesn't appear so, the element is shown inside this popup called a "qTip" though, presumably this http://qtip1.com so its' possibly there is some CSS tomfoolery at work
[2015-03-09 15:02:01] dude-x: you can still get a macbook pro with Thunderbolt 2, Retina and Forcetouch trackpad. ï£¿
[2015-03-09 15:02:31] AutomatedTester: I was hoping that I could get an air that could still build
[2015-03-09 15:03:20] dude-x: i wonder if the new Macbook will phase out the air
[2015-03-09 15:03:27] AutomatedTester: probably
[2015-03-09 15:03:33] dude-x: relegating the Air only for iPads
[2015-03-09 15:03:53] AutomatedTester: I reckon they will stop working on iPads soo
[2015-03-09 15:03:56] AutomatedTester: soon

[2015-03-09 15:04:14] AutomatedTester: ipads arent selling very well
[2015-03-09 15:04:22] dude-x: i was hoping it would replace the ipad
[2015-03-09 15:04:23] dude-x: but no.
[2015-03-09 15:04:57] dude-x: when you turn it horizontal, it just feels like an ipad that's cut in half
[2015-03-09 15:10:51] moo-_-: yeah, after upgrading my phone to 5" I use less and less the tablet
[2015-03-09 15:11:07] moo-_-: I was pretty skeptical about "phablets" before, but I can start to see the point
