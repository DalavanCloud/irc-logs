[2015-03-03 06:47:11] antsanto: One issue, I feel is, the toDataUrl method of canvas, does gives me very long String, which Java doesnt support. Aprat from it, I guess it should work. Kindly let me know the thoughts on it

[2015-03-03 06:51:40] AutomatedTester: antsanto: in theory pushing the DOM to canvas to get the dataURL should work
[2015-03-03 06:51:46] AutomatedTester: that's what the FirefoxDriver does
[2015-03-03 06:52:14] antsanto: AutomatedTester: Really? Then you should be able to answer the question, then how your handling the string that canvas toDataURL in Java?

[2015-03-03 07:01:27] jarib: i think getting ruby onto the VMs was the previous blocker
[2015-03-03 07:01:39] jarib: the shortest route would be to set up a travis build
[2015-03-03 07:01:50] antsanto: AutomatedTester: Interesting . . . Let me check it . . .
[2015-03-03 07:02:01] jarib: that at least runs firefox tests for non-java
[2015-03-03 07:02:03] ato: jarib: Would we need a specific version of Ruby?
[2015-03-03 07:02:22] jarib: just >= 1.9.3 IIRC

[2015-03-03 07:14:57] mtscout6: ato: I'd love to see those images used in part of the Selenium build process, or even created and tested within the current build process. It may make it easier to run various load tests for a selenium grid scenario.

[2015-03-03 07:18:05] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i can make the change. it's fairly localized. however, what do you need me to do to test it? i don't have an easily create-able marionette client.
[2015-03-03 07:18:07] ato: WhereIsMySpoon, AutomatedTester: I was thinking about that the other day.  It should be possible to configure the jobs in Jenkins so that they could pick up a remote branch.
[2015-03-03 07:18:30] ato: WhereIsMySpoon, AutomatedTester: It would be interesting if we had a bot that would pick up all new PRs and give them a run on Jenkins for example.
[2015-03-03 07:18:50] jimevans: or did you roll that change into current firefox driver?

[2015-03-03 07:19:39] WhereIsMySpoon: its a little less complex as its just jenkins polling a test branch which it does out the box whereas you would have to integrate PRs
[2015-03-03 07:19:46] jarib: AutomatedTester: famous last words
[2015-03-03 07:19:58] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i get it. i just want to know what remote ends already implement that part of the protocol.
[2015-03-03 07:20:08] AutomatedTester: jimevans: FirefoxDriver
[2015-03-03 07:20:17] AutomatedTester: and Marionette
[2015-03-03 07:20:30] AutomatedTester: jimevans: you could make IEDriver understand it if you wanted :D
[2015-03-03 07:20:32] jimevans: i'll fix IE driver to do the same.
[2015-03-03 07:20:54] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I did a1d7320
[2015-03-03 07:21:01] ato: mtscout6: Yes, to have some verification that they work would be miles better than what we have now.  And dogfooding them would seem the natural, least-effort way to approach that.
[2015-03-03 07:21:11] jimevans: okay, cleaning and building, then i'll test.

[2015-03-03 07:22:33] WhereIsMySpoon: not github
[2015-03-03 07:22:53] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: For Selenium?  We mostly get code submissions as PRs on Github.
[2015-03-03 07:22:58] WhereIsMySpoon: oh
[2015-03-03 07:23:02] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: We get a few as .patch files on GC.
[2015-03-03 07:23:15] WhereIsMySpoon: then it looks to be fairly streaightforward to integrate that with jenkins
[2015-03-03 07:23:21] WhereIsMySpoon: theres a github PR plugin
[2015-03-03 07:23:54] ato: It's just a matter of wanting to wrestle with the Jenkins infrastructure, I think.
[2015-03-03 07:23:55] WhereIsMySpoon: and lots of articles about it
[2015-03-03 07:24:18] mtscout6: ato: The added benefit of bringing docker into the build process is that you can have build agents or slaves that are docker containers themselves. So if you need specific versions of Ruby, or Python or even Java the list goes on you can define that in your agent and test it locally without adding more to you own machine
[2015-03-03 07:24:37] AutomatedTester: why can't we just get our stuff working on Travis ?
[2015-03-03 07:24:48] AutomatedTester: why worry about the infra
[2015-03-03 07:25:01] WhereIsMySpoon: i have no idea what travis is
[2015-03-03 07:25:37] jarib: AutomatedTester: +1
[2015-03-03 07:25:50] mtscout6: Part of the problem I've found with travis is actually driving a browser, as far as I know they don't allow that. Instead they suggest you delegate out to something like sauce labs
[2015-03-03 07:26:03] ato: Suggesting to redo everything from the ground up seems a lot more work than making changes to what we already have.
[2015-03-03 07:26:05] AutomatedTester: mtscout6: no, they do allow it
[2015-03-03 07:26:15] jarib: they do allow it, and we already use sauce labs..
[2015-03-03 07:26:19] ato: mtscout6: We already delegate to Sauce Labs for most of our Java tests.
[2015-03-03 07:26:53] mtscout6: gotcha, I have not been able to get browser tests working yet. But I haven't tried in a few months
[2015-03-03 07:27:02] mtscout6: on travis that is

[2015-03-03 07:27:11] AutomatedTester: ato: are you saying jenkins is more work than travis?
[2015-03-03 07:27:42] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: other way around i think
[2015-03-03 07:27:57] ato: I think I was suggesting the opposite, but I'm not alien to switching.
[2015-03-03 07:28:17] AutomatedTester: so the amount of effort for travis is updating a yml
[2015-03-03 07:28:38] AutomatedTester: and then we dont have to worry that our docker images are up to date
[2015-03-03 07:30:54] AutomatedTester: if we had time to maintain the things all the time I might feel differently but I am just thinking about if people are away on holiday or whatever
[2015-03-03 07:32:33] ato: It would be interesting if someone who has experience with it, and above all else time, would experiment with it and see if it fills our needs.
[2015-03-03 07:33:09] ato: Cirkey, I forgot my tea cup.
[2015-03-03 07:33:28] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: well it seems at the moment getting 3 or 4 different people to run tests for all the different languages is a really inefficient setup
[2015-03-03 07:33:38] WhereIsMySpoon: you will take all day to coordinate a test run of one change
[2015-03-03 07:34:05] AutomatedTester: not really, for the most part java catches the errors

[2015-03-03 09:06:48] ato: IIRC the issue with window names is that they aren't always conclusive?
[2015-03-03 09:06:56] WhereIsMySpoon: how on earth am i supposed to logically switch to a new window if i cant use the window name?

[2015-03-03 09:12:26] jimevans: but the concept would work.

[2015-03-03 09:13:19] Pachecovit, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-03 09:13:43] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: So the issue here is that you could have two windows with identical names, but by definition the ordering of the sequence of windows returned by getWindowHandles() is undefined (meaning it's UA specific).  How would you guarantee the same behaviour in different drivers?
[2015-03-03 09:13:54] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: https://gist.github.com/AutomatedTester/3c2c4e4d4e221e507b49
[2015-03-03 09:13:56] jimevans: i suppose i could clean it up and make a fuller, more robust example out of that, but the idea is sound.
[2015-03-03 09:13:59] AutomatedTester: roughly
[2015-03-03 09:14:34] jimevans: or, you could use the .NET bindings, which has a PopupWindowFinder class in the support libraries. :)
[2015-03-03 09:14:46] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: the point is that I already have a nice solution where I can pass the window.name, and if I have 2 windows with the same name that are actually windows with different content then its an application problem
[2015-03-03 09:15:05] WhereIsMySpoon: it seems a rather pointless waste of work to remove functionality that makes people's life simpler
[2015-03-03 09:15:31] WhereIsMySpoon: i feel the same way about removing the ability to specify id in switchTo().frame
[2015-03-03 09:15:44] shri: why would you need more than 2 windows let alone 2 with the same name?
[2015-03-03 09:16:02] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: what happens if window.name is the same as your current window
[2015-03-03 09:16:21] ato: From a protocol level point of view it's better to remove any source of incompatibilities when the current behaviour can easily be achieved with a minimal amount of library code, like AutomatedTester jsut showed.
[2015-03-03 09:16:23] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: see above, "if I have 2 windows with the same name that are actually windows with different content then its an application problem"

[2015-03-03 09:17:49] ato: For example, one could potentially have the client binding retain backwards-compatibility for switching by name.
[2015-03-03 09:18:06] ato: I'm not sure it's a good idea, but it's possible.
[2015-03-03 09:18:30] WhereIsMySpoon: sure, why not bake AutomatedTester's solution into the client bindings
[2015-03-03 09:18:55] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: add it to the expected conditions class
[2015-03-03 09:18:59] ato: Right, but we need to be super-clear about what the drivers should implement.
[2015-03-03 09:19:25] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: i hear you about switching windows. i don't agree, but i hear you. i don't understand your not about frames. fundamentally, what's the difference between 'driver.switchTo().frame("foo")' and 'driver.switchTo().frame(driver.findElement(By.id("foo"))'?

[2015-03-03 09:21:01] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: hm, maybe I misremembered, I thought you were removing the ability to specify frames by id entirely and not adding another way
[2015-03-03 09:21:09] WhereIsMySpoon: in that case it isnt a very big deal
[2015-03-03 09:21:17] lukeis: ato: new evidence regarding what?

[2015-03-03 09:22:23] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: yes, removing the ability to specify frames by id entirely. that's correct. the way to implement (what should be) the identical behavior is to replace the string with a webelement containing the frame/iframe.
[2015-03-03 09:22:30] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I need to send my email about it
[2015-03-03 09:22:47] AutomatedTester: jleyba: and will also add that mozilla will be divergent from the spec until we have getProperty
[2015-03-03 09:23:01] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: eh. "string argument with a webelement argument"
[2015-03-03 09:23:22] AutomatedTester: need to feed my kids, bbl
[2015-03-03 09:23:32] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: sounds fine to me
[2015-03-03 09:23:33] jimevans: so you have two ways to switch to frames. by index, and by the element containing the frame.
[2015-03-03 09:23:44] jleyba: AutomatedTester: you'll notice the atoms have getProperty and getAttribute b/c gdennis refused to conflate the two ;)
[2015-03-03 09:23:48] lukeis: did we agree on index?
[2015-03-03 09:23:59] jimevans: lukeis: last i remembered we did, yes.
[2015-03-03 09:24:25] lukeis: interesting… since browsers behave differently when you do some strange frame inserting dynamically :)
[2015-03-03 09:24:40] Pachecovit, leaving. (#selenium)
[2015-03-03 09:24:55] jleyba: lukeis: can always omit index from client apis
[2015-03-03 09:24:57] WhereIsMySpoon: by index do you mean z-index?
[2015-03-03 09:25:06] lukeis: no… document.frames[N]
[2015-03-03 09:25:19] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2015-03-03 09:25:27] WhereIsMySpoon: that seems like a nice game to play
[2015-03-03 09:26:06] lukeis: the DOM retains a reference to the frames, typically in the order they appear in the DOM...
[2015-03-03 09:26:18] WhereIsMySpoon: which is surely totally up to the browser
[2015-03-03 09:26:29] WhereIsMySpoon: seems dangerous
[2015-03-03 09:26:32] lukeis: i say typically… because well, IE will do things differently if you dynamically insert frames above other ones :)
[2015-03-03 09:27:07] jleyba: lukeis: isn't document.frames[N] always tree order at the time of access?
[2015-03-03 09:27:12] lukeis: nope
[2015-03-03 09:27:17] lukeis: can't say always
[2015-03-03 09:27:19] jimevans: lukeis: as of now, switching to via index is in the spec. defined to be the same as the result of window.frames[n].
[2015-03-03 09:27:38] lukeis: i believe barancev had an example that showed how browsers behaved differently
[2015-03-03 09:27:53] lukeis: jimevans: yes
[2015-03-03 09:28:00] lukeis: and that's how we avoid the browser inconsistency

[2015-03-03 10:23:07] Unknown44191: is this a known issue?
[2015-03-03 10:24:46] jimevans: Unknown44191: you shouldn't use the microsoft webdriver implementation. the client bindings and microsoft's implementation don't yet speak the same wire protocol
[2015-03-03 10:24:59] jimevans: and won't until microsoft updates their implementation.
[2015-03-03 10:26:20] SitamJana, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-03 10:26:56] jimevans: besides that, their implementation is missing basic functionality at present.
[2015-03-03 10:27:28] Unknown44191: so basically microsoft webdriver cannot be used until microsoft updates their implementation?

[2015-03-03 10:27:59] davehunt, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2015-03-03 10:29:17] jimevans: the last update to their implementation was september 2014, as far as i'm aware. that release is not fit for purpose. it's missing core functionality (getting an element text as one example), and it doesn't use the same protocol as other implementations (using "id" in the json serialization of webelements as an example). they are aware of these issues, but have not released any updates to their implementation to my knowledge.
[2015-03-03 10:29:52] jimevans: until those glaring issues are fixed, it won't be usable with any of the client language bindings.
[2015-03-03 10:30:50] jleyba: jimevans you should go work for MS and finish their driver for them.  charge ridiculous contractor fees in the process
[2015-03-03 10:31:13] jimevans: they don't want me.
[2015-03-03 10:31:50] Unknown44191: Thanks. We wanted to try this out since we have not been able to get IE11 working for previous versions of IEDRiver (typing based tests are extremely slow) and with 2.44.0 we do see driver connection issues sporadically. Is there a release expected soon that will fix these issues?
[2015-03-03 10:32:07] jimevans: use the 32-bit version of the driver.
[2015-03-03 10:32:43] Unknown44191: sounds good. Thanks for all your help!

[2015-03-03 11:35:15] Back2Basics: I already have a connection to a particular webpage, logged in, (so I don't want to lose the credentials) I want to start a connection to a website subdirectory but without starting a new session via .get()?  Any clues?
[2015-03-03 11:37:12] jimevans: Back2Basics: nope.
[2015-03-03 11:37:30] jimevans: (can't connect to an existing session)
[2015-03-03 11:38:14] jimevans: there may be hacks to get around that limitation, but in general, it's not a supported scenario
[2015-03-03 11:39:16] lukeis: just pass the driver instance over? unless you're running this in separate processes??
[2015-03-03 11:39:38] Back2Basics: same process.
[2015-03-03 11:40:21] lukeis: it's possible… just varying levels of difficulty with hacking away at the standard selenium client languages  (like it's relatively easy to do in python… not as in java)
[2015-03-03 11:40:50] lukeis: it would be discouraged… just pass the driver variable around instead though
[2015-03-03 11:40:55] ddary, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-03 11:41:27] Back2Basics: I'm in python. So I'm doing,  driver.get(base_url); #do stuff to log in; driver.get(other_url)
[2015-03-03 11:41:47] lukeis: sounds good… what's the issue? :)
[2015-03-03 11:42:03] Back2Basics: But without the   .get(other_url)
[2015-03-03 11:42:16] lukeis: >.>
[2015-03-03 11:43:19] Back2Basics: I need a function driver.click_on_the_dang_a_href_that_doesn't_have_an_ID_field()
[2015-03-03 11:43:51] lukeis: what does it have? :)
[2015-03-03 11:43:57] lukeis: you have many ways to find elements
[2015-03-03 11:44:10] jleyba: driver.findElement(By.css("a[href]")).click()?
[2015-03-03 11:45:33] jleyba: that reminds me... lukeis: I know you don't use js, but how do you feel about findElement accepting strings as shorthand for By.css?
[2015-03-03 11:45:38] jleyba: driver.findElement("#foo")
[2015-03-03 11:46:12] lukeis: in JS only? or are you suggesting that for java?
[2015-03-03 11:47:03] jleyba: I guess across the board for consistency.
[2015-03-03 11:47:10] lukeis: and meh, i suppose that would be fine with me
[2015-03-03 11:47:20] lukeis: well, python would be a little weird
[2015-03-03 11:47:28] lukeis: and wouldn't be good there
[2015-03-03 11:47:44] lukeis: we'd have to do string parsing, since the by locators are strings already
[2015-03-03 11:47:55] lukeis: the using* i mean
[2015-03-03 11:48:09] jimevans: jleyba: i'd oppose that. mostly because jquery confusion

[2015-03-03 11:49:43] barancev: or we end up with RC-style "locator type autodetection"
[2015-03-03 11:49:51] lukeis: jleyba: i'd be happier with it just in JS… but then maybe  driver("#foo") ?  :)
[2015-03-03 11:50:03] jleyba: lukeis yeah... fuck that
[2015-03-03 11:50:09] lukeis: ;)
[2015-03-03 11:50:40] Back2Basics: How would you wrap something like this?  body>div>div.container>div>div:nth-child(1)>div>ul>li:nth-child(1)>a  is that valid css?
[2015-03-03 11:51:07] lukeis: i would never make such a brittle locator :)
[2015-03-03 11:51:15] sircapsalot: Back2Basics yes, but that's extremely reliant on the hierarchy.. is there any element with anything more unique closer to the "a" at the end?
[2015-03-03 11:51:24] sircapsalot: very bad practice to do selectors like that
[2015-03-03 11:51:42] lukeis: also, does the link itself have something unique / consistent in it?
[2015-03-03 11:51:54] lukeis: "a[href*='something']"
[2015-03-03 11:51:58] sircapsalot: and *never* stem from body..

[2015-03-03 11:53:32] LocusAsaf: does anyone have experience with using selenium with javascript bindings such as nightwatch.js or webdriver.io
[2015-03-03 11:53:36] Back2Basics: I tried link text but it's not matching it.
[2015-03-03 11:53:41] sircapsalot: you can match on more than ID remember.. is there anything unique? title, value, even a class?   make a :gist of the surrounding html Back2Basics
[2015-03-03 11:53:49] LocusAsaf: I'm wondering if there are pros & cons vs. using the python bindings
[2015-03-03 11:54:17] lukeis: LocusAsaf: you want to compare third party javascript bindings to the python ones??
[2015-03-03 11:54:30] jleyba: LocusAsaf, they are third-party implementations
[2015-03-03 11:54:31] fabrice31, joining. (#selenium)

[2015-03-03 11:55:04] lukeis: :wiki webdriverjs
[2015-03-03 11:55:13] lukeis: those are selenium's javascript bindings ^
[2015-03-03 11:55:20] *jleyba is going to kill that wiki page some time in the next week'
[2015-03-03 11:55:23] lukeis: heh
[2015-03-03 11:55:28] lukeis: what should we link instead?
[2015-03-03 11:55:37] jleyba: http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/javascript/index.html
[2015-03-03 11:55:45] jleyba: user guide will be included with that
[2015-03-03 11:55:47] LocusAsaf: so you're saying if I'm going to use selenium with javascript I should use the link you sent?
[2015-03-03 11:56:01] lukeis: it would certainly be recommended
[2015-03-03 11:56:09] LocusAsaf: because...
[2015-03-03 11:56:11] lukeis: plus you can come in here and harass jleyba ;)
[2015-03-03 11:56:16] lukeis: it's
[2015-03-03 11:56:20] lukeis: "supported"
[2015-03-03 11:56:27] lukeis: by us :)
[2015-03-03 11:56:50] LocusAsaf: do you suppose these links I posted are just wrappers over the "supported" version?
[2015-03-03 11:56:56] lukeis: nope
[2015-03-03 11:57:01] lukeis: they are separate implementations
[2015-03-03 11:57:21] jimevans: because javascript developers *hate* using other peoples' code.
[2015-03-03 11:57:22] jimevans: :)
[2015-03-03 11:57:31] lukeis: cause if you work in javascript and haven't written every library yourself, you're not a javascript developer
[2015-03-03 11:57:45] jleyba: LocusAsaf: nightwatch and webdriverio use their own style api
[2015-03-03 11:57:47] jimevans: yeah, that.
[2015-03-03 11:58:30] LocusAsaf: you're being facetious I take it?
[2015-03-03 11:58:35] LocusAsaf: lukeis: ^
[2015-03-03 11:58:41] lukeis: a bit :)

[2015-03-03 11:59:22] mach6: ^ more like 95%, imo
[2015-03-03 11:59:22] LocusAsaf: okay so if I use these custom implementations I'm basically taking risks that stuff will work not well and it's not the officially supported selenium
[2015-03-03 11:59:58] lukeis: correct :)
[2015-03-03 12:00:11] jleyba: jimevans, lukeis: http://www.allenpike.com/2015/javascript-framework-fatigue/
[2015-03-03 12:00:23] LocusAsaf: okay, so that gets me started
[2015-03-03 12:00:39] LocusAsaf: what about WebDriverJS vs. the python implementation?
[2015-03-03 12:00:58] jleyba: do you prefer working in js or python?
[2015-03-03 12:01:15] LocusAsaf: so none?
[2015-03-03 12:01:32] LocusAsaf: I mean, if I preferred one over the other that would be my personal pro and con?
[2015-03-03 12:01:36] lukeis: jleyba: lol
[2015-03-03 12:01:51] LocusAsaf: I mean I personally prefer Python
[2015-03-03 12:01:51] jleyba: if you're not comfortable in js, don't use webdriverjs
[2015-03-03 12:02:07] jleyba: webdriverjs' taret audience is js developers that are familiar with the language
[2015-03-03 12:02:11] *lukeis recommends python :)'

[2015-03-03 12:02:25] lukeis: stateful testing shouldn't be done in an async language :-D
[2015-03-03 12:03:34] LocusAsaf: by asynch programming does that extend beyond using asynchronous functions that wait for page actions?

[2015-03-03 12:11:23] LocusAsaf: I've used JS before but I've never thought about the asynch aspect of it which lends itself well to dynamic web applications but probably not so well to testing perhaps

[2015-03-03 12:31:47] lukeis: you can use the time module… but then you'd need to format it
[2015-03-03 12:32:06] jleyba: just need ms since epoch
[2015-03-03 12:32:53] lukeis: time.time() ?
[2015-03-03 12:33:43] lukeis: time.ctime() seems nicely formated (and shorter than datetime)

[2015-03-03 12:48:55] AutomatedTester: and they followed the spec and everyone else didnt
[2015-03-03 12:48:56] sircapsalot: what is third_party/py

[2015-03-03 14:07:01] Cono_: Hello all
[2015-03-03 14:07:28] Cono_: definitely a newbie to both Selenium and I suppose IRC to a certain extent
[2015-03-03 14:08:01] lukeis: hi Cono_ welcome and feel free to :ask :)
[2015-03-03 14:08:15] Cono_: got a question...I read somewhere that Selenium's explicit waits and implicit waits aremutually exclusive
[2015-03-03 14:08:24] lukeis: :waits
[2015-03-03 14:08:30] jimevans: yeah, don't mix em
[2015-03-03 14:08:47] lukeis: not necessarily, but you shouldn't use both at the same time, you'll end up with unexpected results
[2015-03-03 14:09:05] Cono_: based on the videos and guidance I've seen, thanks selbot2, yes I do think I've read that link, explicits vs. implicits
[2015-03-03 14:09:45] Cono_: I have an implicit wait set when I create an instance of my broswer/driver object
[2015-03-03 14:10:00] Cono_: using C# by the way, and Webdriver 2.44
[2015-03-03 14:10:18] jimevans: Cono_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15164742/combining-implicit-wait-and-explicit-wait-together-results-in-unexpected-wait-ti/15174978
[2015-03-03 14:10:25] jimevans: see that for reasons why not to mix.
[2015-03-03 14:10:26] Cono_: and so far my test work great in Firefox 35.0.1
[2015-03-03 14:10:37] Cono_: but with IE10 they just tank immediately
[2015-03-03 14:10:57] jimevans: Cono_: define "tank" :)
[2015-03-03 14:11:16] Cono_: where my assertions for page titles are being evaluated prior to the next page actually being loaded
[2015-03-03 14:11:18] swypych_, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-03-03 14:11:26] Cono_: tank means they fail miserably and very early on
[2015-03-03 14:11:34] jimevans: okay, so titles aren't affected by implicit waits.
[2015-03-03 14:11:53] swypych, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-03 14:11:58] Cono_: right, so now I have an explicit wait in my page object
[2015-03-03 14:12:04] jimevans: implicit waits affect calls for finding elements, and only calls for finding elements.
[2015-03-03 14:12:24] Cono_: interesting, thank you jim
[2015-03-03 14:12:55] Cono_: my other question is...are explicit waits and the pagefactory pattern usage mutually exclusive?
[2015-03-03 14:13:36] jimevans: g'night all!
[2015-03-03 14:13:37] jimevans, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-03-03 14:13:39] Cono_: and I guess my question also is...why do tests work great in FF, intermittently so so in Chrome, but awfully in IE 10
[2015-03-03 14:13:49] Cono_: g' night
[2015-03-03 14:16:19] Cono_: using only an implicit wait works fine in FF yet not in IE, why the difference? it is difference, since I have to accomodate IE, that is causing me to have to rewrite my code..IE is king...well in this environment it is
