[2015-03-17 11:28:47] Conio: Hi All, are the LoadableComponent classes or implementations the same between Java and C#?
[2015-03-17 11:29:07] Conio: all of the documentation that I've managed to find thus far illustrate Java only
[2015-03-17 11:29:49] Conio: but I'm looking at my Object browser right now..and I see way more methods implemented in there than Just Load() and isLoaded()
[2015-03-17 11:29:56] jimevans: Conio: there might be some implementation detail differences, but the effect should be mostly the same.
[2015-03-17 11:30:08] Conio: thank you Jim
[2015-03-17 11:30:33] Conio: the .net version has 6 diff't methods and 2 properties
[2015-03-17 11:30:52] Conio: but I don't see a get() method in there
[2015-03-17 11:31:31] jimevans: copied from the :apidocs for .NET
[2015-03-17 11:31:46] jimevans: on the load() method "This is equivalent to the Get() method in Java version."
[2015-03-17 11:31:58] Conio: documentation I've read so far recommends NOT calling the load() method directly but rather the get() method...which in turn takes care of calling both the load() and isLoaded() methods
[2015-03-17 11:32:17] Conio: I see...
[2015-03-17 11:32:18] jimevans: the API is slightly different.
[2015-03-17 11:32:51] jimevans: in the .NET version, the Load method is the same as java's get() method. the .NET equivalent to java's load() is TryLoad()
[2015-03-17 11:33:38] Conio: i know the LoadComponent class can be used for whole pages...but was its original intent for "subpages" or sub-components in AJAX pages?
[2015-03-17 11:33:41] jimevans: and the visibility of those methods is slightly different
[2015-03-17 11:34:00] Conio: got it...do appreciate the clarifications Jim
[2015-03-17 11:34:03] jimevans: yeah, the original intent was for use with components.
[2015-03-17 11:34:39] jimevans: the .NET api was made to feel more "natural" to .NET developers than a straight port of java method names.

[2015-03-17 11:35:50] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-03-17 11:36:02] Conio: makes sense...can you point me at any .NET-specific documentation for the LoadableComponent or SlowLoadableComponent classes? believe me, I've tried finding it so I'm not looking for a free ride here
[2015-03-17 11:38:21] jimevans: :apidocs doesn't work?
[2015-03-17 11:38:44] jimevans: you won't find a ton of examples.
[2015-03-17 11:39:26] jimevans: for a long time, the .NET support classes were intended to be example, "how would i implement something like x" stuff.
[2015-03-17 11:39:30] Conio: yeah, I'm looking over that right now...but was hoping for something like actual usage...I'm actually having doubts as to whether it would be of much benefit to my AUT
[2015-03-17 11:40:12] Conio: most of the pages in my application load fairly quickly...but there's about 3 or 5 that are a lot more involved or load a good amount of data by default and are fairly slow in loading
[2015-03-17 11:40:21] jimevans: but apparently people are in general too lazy to build their own, and want everything handed to them by *just* the webdriver project, so more stuff has been added over time, but frankly, i'm too lazy to do full example documentation.
[2015-03-17 11:41:49] Conio: I see Jim...don't blame ya.  By the looks of it, it seems like you've been involved for quite a while.  I keep coming across your posts over in Stack Overflow...dating back a few years

[2015-03-17 18:38:55] brizz: ive tried to solve this problem for a while, and taking a look at it again
[2015-03-17 18:39:02] brizz: is there anyway w/selenium webdriver to do the following
[2015-03-17 18:39:04] brizz:  a = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//span/input"), b = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//span/input2"), then do wait.until(a | b): if a: elif b:
[2015-03-17 18:39:26] brizz: basically, 'wait' until either element a or element b shows up, and immediately do something based on which element showed up?
