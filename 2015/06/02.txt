[2015-06-02 02:43:04] andy_seit: Hey there.  I'm seeing a ton of IE automation problems at the moment caused by document.readyState != complete, causing tests to drop out.  Is there anything that can/should be done from an automation perspective to mitigate it, other than saying 'fix the page'?
[2015-06-02 02:46:32] Dave_B_: SitamJana: https://twitter.com/thejohnjansen/status/596083813328887808 I think there is no real eta yet
[2015-06-02 02:46:53] Dave_B_: jimevans will probably be on later and would be likely to know the latest (outside of people in MS)

[2015-06-02 02:50:48] SitamJana: Dave_B_: Yeah. But it's fine. We are yet to have significant client base on Microsoft Edge. But sooner we can expect to grow. Hope we can see some real progress here sooner rather than later.

[2015-06-02 09:14:40] sjmikem: When running them on an ubuntu server (same version of Chrome, webdriver, and selenium server), tests think that the modal dialog is blocking the click when it isn't

[2015-06-02 09:25:47] lukeis: since sauce has an open ssl issue with uplaods
[2015-06-02 09:25:58] *lukeis has that ticket open ;)'
[2015-06-02 09:26:26] sjmikem: lukeis: not yet - we're trying to strip as much out of our proprietary stuff out as possible so that we can share
[2015-06-02 09:26:33] lukeis: thanks :)
[2015-06-02 09:26:57] sjmikem: it would help if I could understand better why Chrome might think the element is misplaced
[2015-06-02 09:27:55] sjmikem: when we get a screenshot on the error, it does not appear that the modal is blocking where we are cliking
[2015-06-02 09:27:59] lukeis: too many variables for us to guess at, thus way we need a :repro test case
[2015-06-02 09:28:00] titusfortner: sjmikem: what is the error? Is it saying the element isn't displayed, or is it Chrome's "Element is not clickable" exception?
[2015-06-02 09:28:10] lukeis: sjmikem: an AlertPresent exception will cause the driver to auto dismiss the alert
[2015-06-02 09:28:43] jimevans: of course, if it's bootstrap, there might be animation happening?
[2015-06-02 09:28:46] *jimevans doesn't know bootstrap'
[2015-06-02 09:28:49] sjmikem: titusfortner: looking, 1 sec
[2015-06-02 09:29:19] jimevans: so if the target element is blocked transiently by a moving element higher in the z-order, that might be part of it.
[2015-06-02 09:29:30] jimevans: total shot in the dark
[2015-06-02 09:29:50] sjmikem: jimevans: my understanding is that protractor is supposed to wait for the animation to complete before doing proceeding to next step
[2015-06-02 09:30:09] *lukeis doesn't want to play 20 questions ;)'
[2015-06-02 09:30:09] *jimevans doesn't know protractor either'
[2015-06-02 09:30:46] lukeis: protractor! yikes! … runs for the hills
[2015-06-02 09:30:47] *lukeis goes to update ci, like i said i would'
[2015-06-02 09:30:47] jimevans: plus, i thought protractor only had hooks into angular, not other frameworks like bootstrap. but again, dunno any of those frameworks, so have no idea if that's actually true.
[2015-06-02 09:31:31] jimevans: i *do* know that it's highly unlikely that protractor can generically wait for all animation for all javascript widget frameworks. there's just too much variability in how to make that happen for a one-size-fits-all solution.

[2015-06-02 10:22:17] octomeow: Sauce Labs sound amazing, since they use Appium
[2015-06-02 10:22:24] MonkeysPaw: octomeow: I suppose it depends on how you're automating your test cases. The walk-thru's I've seen for calling Sauce Labs to handle the tests are fairly straight forward. I think there's even a "try it before you buy it" option for the smaller scale users. Couldn't hurt to jot down some simple unit tests and run them to see if it's what you're looking for.
[2015-06-02 10:22:30] MonkeysPaw: All it costs you is time. ;)
[2015-06-02 10:23:45] MonkeysPaw: I think the screenshots and video replays when an error is detected is especially useful.

[2015-06-02 12:23:41] lukeis: we're using packer and vagrant
[2015-06-02 12:24:06] AutomatedTester: lukeis: taskcluster (http://docs.taskcluster.net) is something we're currently building out for our build/test infra
[2015-06-02 12:24:13] lukeis: yep, know about it

[2015-06-02 12:25:03] AutomatedTester: getting the scaling right first
[2015-06-02 12:25:18] AutomatedTester: but it will be there
[2015-06-02 12:25:35] AutomatedTester: scaling and reporting are hard yo
[2015-06-02 12:26:20] lukeis: we're using vagrant + vmware and we've got a couple different images now…. 'vagrant up'! and with some other bootstrapping scripts on bare metal machines and off we go! ;)
[2015-06-02 12:26:57] AutomatedTester: awesome
[2015-06-02 12:26:58] lukeis: yes… working on the scaling, etc now too…. attempting to use consul
