[2015-06-24 12:11:45] IanC_: driver.get("https://mydevice:8443")  prompts me with the authentication dialog box; however I never get to the Alert alert = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent()); on the next line never gets called.
[2015-06-24 12:12:28] IanC_: All code samples show people calling driver.get first.
[2015-06-24 12:12:55] lukeis: selenium#34  :-D
[2015-06-24 12:13:35] lukeis: it's a pretty old bug… getting some attention in the spec, but not really implemented

[2015-06-24 12:15:10] lukeis: heh… just made the connection that this is bug 34 ;) (you know… like Selenium 34th element)
[2015-06-24 12:15:30] IanC_: ha
[2015-06-24 12:15:51] IanC_: lukeis - Thank you i will look at the issue link
[2015-06-24 12:16:22] lukeis: IanC_: the more up to date issue #453

[2015-06-24 12:17:07] lukeis: the last comment in there has the "how to actually do it right now"
[2015-06-24 12:17:21] dude-x: omg, i am really slow. i now understand why Dave Haeffner calls his material 'Elemental Selenium'
[2015-06-24 12:17:33] lukeis: (facepalm)
[2015-06-24 12:17:57] lukeis: dude-x: adam goucher has always had "Element-34" :)
[2015-06-24 12:18:06] dude-x: i was wondering what would happen if raw selenium and mercury would combine.
[2015-06-24 12:18:23] dude-x: and then i thought of the word elemental.

[2015-06-24 12:25:56] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: the down side is that it is making atom very slow at the moment

[2015-06-24 12:26:25] jcrawford: hey everyone having an issue with PHPUnit_Selenium2TestCase, don't want to flood the channel with the long explanation but here is a screen shot.  I can flood if you wish though :) http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=25p1w92&s=8
[2015-06-24 12:29:41] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-24 12:31:14] jcrawford: basically an iframe is injected into the layout on button click, but when running under chromedriver with selenium server it cannot seem to even find the iframe element even though it exists as it shows on the screen.  However in view source it doesn't exist because the click event hasn't fired
[2015-06-24 12:31:30] jcrawford: so I am at a loss as to why it cannot find this element by classname, xpath, etc

[2015-06-24 12:34:11] dgempesaw: jcrawford: are you searching for the iframe itself? or an element inside the iframe?
[2015-06-24 12:34:13] tony, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-24 12:34:43] jcrawford: i need to get the iFrame element by className or XPath so that i can use js to attach an id attribute for use when calling $this->frame(frameIdAttr);
[2015-06-24 12:34:57] jcrawford: I know i cannot grab an element from inside the frame without first switching context
[2015-06-24 12:35:10] jcrawford: i just cannot seem to get the iframe element to be found at all
[2015-06-24 12:35:36] jcrawford: no such element errors is all i can seem to get returned
[2015-06-24 12:35:52] jcrawford: and I should add I have no problems grabbing elements which have not been injected during JS events
[2015-06-24 12:36:07] jcrawford: for this same reason I cannot seem to debug a backbone application either
[2015-06-24 12:36:23] dgempesaw: eh, if it's locator help, kinda hard to troubleshoot without seeing the html in question.
[2015-06-24 12:36:36] dgempesaw: mayhaps a timing issue with the button click? are you doing the appropriate waits and the like
[2015-06-24 12:36:49] jcrawford: it's not a matter of it not being located, i am calling $this->byClassName('className'); and it's not seeing the element
[2015-06-24 12:36:54] jcrawford: i have no issues matching other elements at all
[2015-06-24 12:37:05] jcrawford: i did a 2 second wait after the click, same issue
[2015-06-24 12:37:11] gabecase, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-24 12:37:12] jcrawford: i even tried a 10 second wait heh
[2015-06-24 12:37:54] dgempesaw: is the iframe inside of another iframe :P

[2015-06-24 12:41:41] tuxtoti: I set a size for a window. Switch to a new window. return back to the old window. Shouldn't I get the initial size I had set ?
[2015-06-24 12:42:17] tuxtoti: It seems to inherit the size from the second window! Is this a desired behaviour?
[2015-06-24 12:43:13] jcrawford: dgempesaw no it's not
[2015-06-24 12:43:21] jcrawford: i even went as far as trying this code
[2015-06-24 12:43:48] jcrawford: http://pastebin.com/NzGHvVc0
[2015-06-24 12:44:13] jcrawford: adding an id to the iFrame element.  this test now does not fail on not finding the element but acts as if it passes before it finishes execution
[2015-06-24 12:44:49] jcrawford: that test should always fail because the assertEquals will always fail

[2015-06-24 13:11:20] IanC_: lukeis and selbot2: Thank you! the issue urls helped me to resolve my problem. One thing I did not do was apply the network.http.phishy-userpass-length preference. Another issue is that the device I am connecting to had such old hardware I was being a little to quick to see it succeed. :)
[2015-06-24 13:11:41] IanC_: .
[2015-06-24 13:12:12] lukeis: you're welcome ;) (and selbot2 is just a bot :) )
[2015-06-24 13:12:21] dude-x: lukeis: haha, remote call
[2015-06-24 13:12:36] IanC_: ha!
[2015-06-24 13:13:01] lukeis: dude-x: umm, whats funny? :)
[2015-06-24 13:13:26] IanC_: I did not realize selbot2 was a bot
[2015-06-24 13:13:48] dude-x: just reminds me of that someone merged a patch where checking the equality of a webelement did a remote call
[2015-06-24 13:14:27] IanC_: I am slow today. I thought I was being asked what was funny
[2015-06-24 13:14:34] lukeis: dude-x: i can certainly see someone wanting to do something like  return "<%s class='%s'>%s</%s>" % (self.tag_name(), self.get_attribute('class'), self.text, self.tag_name())  …
[2015-06-24 13:15:06] lukeis: dude-x: well, i think that's valid ;)
[2015-06-24 13:15:21] dude-x: should that be a repr or a str though

[2015-06-24 13:15:54] lukeis: yes
[2015-06-24 13:16:12] lukeis: all of those are remote calls
[2015-06-24 13:16:45] dude-x: i guess we shouldn't do the latter since people would abuse that aspect of a webelement

[2015-06-24 15:22:51] phasze1, changing nick to Phasze.
[2015-06-24 15:24:43] jimevans: lukeis: actually, the national flag to which you refer is the second incarnation of the confederate states national flag. the first was the original "stars and bars" design, with a blue field and three bars alternating red-white-red. very similar to the US flag. incidentally, a third flag was introduced near the end of the war that added a vertical red bar to the white flag to lessen the chance that flying it would be mistaken as a flag of surrender.

[2015-06-24 15:42:31] lukeis: and downloads were already stopped there long ago
[2015-06-24 15:43:42] dhoer: so http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com will stick around then?

[2015-06-24 15:45:02] lukeis: if we had done the move to github beforehand, we'd be using the releases there ;)
[2015-06-24 15:45:14] jimevans: but jleyba or sevaseva might have more concrete insight into if anything might be happening to that.
[2015-06-24 15:45:49] lukeis: i'd certainly be recommending moving to Github Release if the storage from google went away

[2015-06-24 15:54:28] jimevans: but apple changed the way safari extensions were handled in the last major release.
[2015-06-24 15:54:32] jimevans: if memory serves.
[2015-06-24 15:54:44] jimevans: jleyba could expound more on that, if he were online.
