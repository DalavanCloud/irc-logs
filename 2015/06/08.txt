[2015-06-08 03:58:09] WhereIsMySpoon: dude-x: yea ive added it as a convenience method in my code now :)
[2015-06-08 03:58:48] dude-x: itâ€™s almost 7 am here
[2015-06-08 03:58:53] dude-x: but now that i read your question better
[2015-06-08 03:59:04] dude-x: it makes sense that you grab all the elements
[2015-06-08 03:59:05] dude-x: first
[2015-06-08 03:59:07] dude-x: then check them all
[2015-06-08 03:59:38] dude-x: in python though, i do have a thing where you can pass in a locator though
[2015-06-08 03:59:56] WhereIsMySpoon: dude-x: meh, all my method does is for each By, does findElement.isDisplayed()
[2015-06-08 04:00:11] WhereIsMySpoon: *findElement(theBy).isDisplayed()
[2015-06-08 04:00:14] dude-x: oh.
[2015-06-08 04:00:15] WhereIsMySpoon: so its pretty much the same
[2015-06-08 04:00:21] WhereIsMySpoon: just a convenience method
[2015-06-08 04:00:55] dude-x: i think the Java version of PresenseOfAllElements still allows for 0 elements
[2015-06-08 04:01:02] dude-x: i think i fixed that in Python

[2015-06-08 08:22:55] aj4u: Hello
[2015-06-08 08:23:04] jimevans: aj4u: hi
[2015-06-08 08:23:27] aj4u: was hoping for a little help
[2015-06-08 08:23:31] jimevans: aj4u: :ask
[2015-06-08 08:23:47] aj4u: I have a webpage with an unordered list
[2015-06-08 08:24:23] aj4u: then in the ul
[2015-06-08 08:24:32] aj4u: I have a number of <li>
[2015-06-08 08:24:56] aj4u: which then have <label> and <span class="value">          </span>
[2015-06-08 08:25:13] aj4u: i've managed to get down to the li them selves
[2015-06-08 08:25:16] aj4u: but for some reason when I do
[2015-06-08 08:25:31] aj4u: li.find_element_by_tag_name('label').text
[2015-06-08 08:26:04] aj4u: I don't get anything back, I'm not sure if i'm on the right path here. ( Please excuse me, i'm a selenium newb) :(
[2015-06-08 08:26:51] jimevans: so can you use :gist or similar to show a more complete example of the html? i think i see the structure, but one line a time it's hard to be sure.
[2015-06-08 08:29:18] aj4u: https://gist.github.com/asharma88/b630f6f0cc73e7111151
[2015-06-08 08:31:01] aj4u: I initially got content-details
[2015-06-08 08:31:11] jimevans: and your code is exactly as you posted above? if you're trying to loop through <li> elements, you'll get exceptions when it hits one that doesn't have a <label> as its immediate child. like the very first <li> in your example.
[2015-06-08 08:31:23] aj4u: yes
[2015-06-08 08:31:25] aj4u: this is it
[2015-06-08 08:31:43] aj4u: I basically need to store label -> Key
[2015-06-08 08:31:51] aj4u: and value -> value
[2015-06-08 08:32:10] aj4u: I can ignore headings
[2015-06-08 08:34:43] Surum, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-08 08:34:55] Surum: hello, I am fighting with the install of selenium on mac
[2015-06-08 08:35:18] Surum: I did this: http://damien.co/resources/how-to-get-started-selenium-2-mac-os-x-java-7403 worked as charm
[2015-06-08 08:35:41] Surum: and then installed eclipse and wanted to do this http://www.toolsqa.com/selenium-webdriver/configure-eclipse-with-selenium-webdriver/
[2015-06-08 08:36:11] Surum: but I have no idea where actually those files are on mac, where is that libs folder... performed search, but it did not find anything
[2015-06-08 08:38:16] aj4u: is label a tag name ?
[2015-06-08 08:38:41] jimevans: aj4u: it is.
[2015-06-08 08:39:29] jimevans: i wouldn't use "by tag name" in this case. i'd use a css selector (more preferred) or xpath (less preferred) to get the element i'm looking for.
[2015-06-08 08:39:56] aj4u: I think I got it
[2015-06-08 08:39:57] sohlemac, quitting. (Quit: No Ping reply in 180 seconds.)
[2015-06-08 08:40:03] aj4u: find_element_by_class_name('value')
[2015-06-08 08:40:08] aj4u: find_element_by_tag_name('label')
[2015-06-08 08:40:53] jimevans: aj4u: that's still going to throw an exception when the <li> element doesn't have one of those as a descendant. like in the header case, where the only child element is an <h2> element.
[2015-06-08 08:41:18] aj4u: so jimevans what do you recommend ?
[2015-06-08 08:41:22] jimevans: but it'd probably work if you account for that.
[2015-06-08 08:41:38] aj4u: yes I was going to put it in a try
[2015-06-08 08:41:46] aj4u: and pass on except
[2015-06-08 08:41:53] aj4u: don't know if this is an atrosity
[2015-06-08 08:42:24] jimevans: if you're okay with potentially missing a legitimate bug in the application where an element should have the child elements but doesn't, that'd be okay.
[2015-06-08 08:42:32] sohlemac, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-08 08:42:41] jimevans: i'd fight like hell to avoid just swallowing an exception like that.
[2015-06-08 08:42:47] jimevans: but it's your code.
[2015-06-08 08:42:54] WhereIsMySpoon: ^
[2015-06-08 08:43:11] WhereIsMySpoon: agree, that sounds dirty
[2015-06-08 08:43:34] aj4u: yes
[2015-06-08 08:43:37] aj4u: you guys are right
[2015-06-08 08:43:47] aj4u: maybe i'll check if its a heading
[2015-06-08 08:43:52] aj4u: if yes then ignore
[2015-06-08 08:43:56] aj4u: else raise
[2015-06-08 08:44:35] jimevans: why not just use a css selector like "li > label" to get the labels, and "li > span.value" to get the values?
[2015-06-08 08:44:50] aj4u: didn't know I could do that
[2015-06-08 08:45:16] jimevans: of course, you run another risk there that you have an <li> that has a label, but not a value, or vice versa.
[2015-06-08 08:45:48] jimevans: and you won't catch that until processing all elements returned and figuring out that there's a mismatch in the number of elements.
[2015-06-08 08:46:07] bitgeeky, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2015-06-08 08:46:38] aj4u:             for attribue in container_list:                 key = attribue.find_element_by_css_selector('li>label')                 value = attribue.find_element_by_css_selector('li>span.value')
[2015-06-08 08:47:16] jimevans: there might be a clever xpath or css selector that says /give me all the <li> elements that have both a descendent of <label> and a descendent of <span class="value">', but i don't have time today to sit and figure out exactly what that would look like.
[2015-06-08 08:47:17] BHS_error: or a xpath to get all the labels, and then for each label, you get the following sibling, which should be the span ?
[2015-06-08 08:49:49] Dave_B_: or if it's always the header at the start you could do a :not :first-of-type or something, bit hacky though
[2015-06-08 08:49:51] BHS_error: first xpath should be something like "//li/label", then for each label, you do something like find_child_element($your_label,'./following-sibling::span')
[2015-06-08 08:50:27] BHS_error: I'm not 100% sure it would work though, but I would try it this way :)
[2015-06-08 08:51:04] jimevans: be aware that :not has issues on some versions of internet explorer.
[2015-06-08 08:51:13] Dave_B_: yeah that's very true
[2015-06-08 08:51:54] jimevans: will run into the same issue with :first-of-type (or :nth-of-type, for that matter)
[2015-06-08 08:52:37] Dave_B_: yep, seems IE8 doesn't support it
[2015-06-08 08:54:27] aj4u: I can't seem to get find_element_by_css_selector('li>label')  to work
[2015-06-08 08:54:36] aj4u: think i'm going to hack it for right now

[2015-06-08 08:55:20] jimevans: protip: when attempting to use css selectors, use the browser's javascript developer console to your advantage.
[2015-06-08 08:55:51] Dave_B_: for basic learning reference: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp
[2015-06-08 08:56:07] WhereIsMySpoon: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors

[2015-06-08 08:56:49] Dave_B_: :)

[2015-06-08 09:00:43] Dave_B_: ah yeah that reminds me, could use the adjacent selector to make sure we got no values without matching keys
[2015-06-08 09:01:50] aj4u: any good books on selenium to get me up to speed?
[2015-06-08 09:01:58] aj4u: I understand how to use the API

[2015-06-08 09:03:23] WhereIsMySpoon: aj4u: a lot of people (myself incl) use it to write automated end to end tests for web apps

[2015-06-08 09:09:02] barancev|2: yes. I mean we need a CI job that runs safari tests
[2015-06-08 09:09:15] aj4u: WhereIsMySpoon> you don't write them no more
[2015-06-08 09:09:16] aj4u: ?
[2015-06-08 09:09:58] barancev|2: I'd say "who cares about safari" but I see somebody does. I personally do not at all
