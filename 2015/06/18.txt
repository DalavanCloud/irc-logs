[2015-06-18 09:14:48] D3M0S: I can see closing without an effort as being misleading to future people filing tickets
[2015-06-18 09:15:27] lukeis: define how much effort?
[2015-06-18 09:15:32] D3M0S: for example, someone files a stupid bug  "FindBy operation doesn't work" and you close with "won't fix" and nothing else
[2015-06-18 09:15:44] D3M0S: if you commented, not enough information then closed
[2015-06-18 09:15:49] D3M0S: that would make sense
[2015-06-18 09:15:53] lukeis: that's why i have my boilerplate response
[2015-06-18 09:15:57] D3M0S: I think that's the bare minimum effort
[2015-06-18 09:16:08] lukeis: for example #683
[2015-06-18 09:16:27] sircapsalot: although, D3M0S, we *do* have a CONTRIBUTING.md.  it's an issuers responsibility to read that.. It even says when creating a new issue - "Make sure to read the CONTRIBUTING guidelines" or whatever
[2015-06-18 09:17:26] D3M0S: I feel like that's enough effort lukeis
[2015-06-18 09:17:29] lukeis: and I'm honestly done without bugs having an actual repro script or results showing what the output was and describing what the output is
[2015-06-18 09:18:27] D3M0S: I wouldn't call that "without effort"
[2015-06-18 09:18:53] D3M0S: you've explained what they did wrong, and pointed them to the resources to do it right
[2015-06-18 09:19:11] lukeis: :) ok then, i'll continue using my bookmarklet ;)

[2015-06-18 11:51:31] lukeis: glad to see a contribution from you Ardesco ;) more coming again i hope?
[2015-06-18 11:52:20] Ardesco: trying, just need more time
[2015-06-18 11:52:41] lukeis: time… ah that precious little commodity :)
[2015-06-18 11:53:03] lukeis: don't you have like 3 kids?
[2015-06-18 11:53:07] Ardesco: i think i may have something for #3604
[2015-06-18 11:53:09] Ardesco: 4 :)
[2015-06-18 11:53:18] lukeis: heh… you have 0 time then :)
[2015-06-18 11:53:28] Ardesco: but I haven’t tested it yet

[2015-06-18 11:53:41] lukeis: ah, that one
[2015-06-18 11:54:04] Ardesco: i’ve got the JS so i can do it with a JavascriptExecutor
[2015-06-18 11:54:10] Ardesco: and it doesn’t use jQuery
[2015-06-18 11:54:21] Ardesco: so it should just be plugging it in
[2015-06-18 11:54:37] Ardesco: famous last words :)

[2015-06-18 11:55:16] lukeis: execute script says you know the complete action… you'll have to punch this in with the current Action chains
[2015-06-18 11:55:22] sircapsalot: funny :)  AutomatedTester and I were just talking about this yesterday
[2015-06-18 11:55:26] Ardesco: I also got asked if i’d write a book, and the last chapter was supposed to be in last Friday
[2015-06-18 11:55:33] Ardesco: so i’m playing catch up
[2015-06-18 11:55:39] sircapsalot: (the rebeccapurple)
[2015-06-18 11:55:51] Ardesco: heh
[2015-06-18 11:56:22] Ardesco: looks like the action chains are just missing the datatransfer part really
[2015-06-18 11:56:50] lukeis: it's a nice looking purple too… updated one of the colors on my work's kanban wall to use it ;)
[2015-06-18 11:57:45] Ardesco: you see the biggest problem i have
[2015-06-18 11:57:50] Ardesco: is every time i try and build selenium
[2015-06-18 11:57:53] Ardesco: it just doesn’t work
[2015-06-18 11:57:57] lukeis: heh
[2015-06-18 11:57:59] Ardesco: can we mavenised it already?
[2015-06-18 11:58:02] Ardesco: gradle even?
[2015-06-18 11:58:05] Ardesco: ;P
[2015-06-18 11:58:37] lukeis: sadly, no… and i agree with the reasons why selenium shouldn't use maven or the like which are basically java-only build tools
[2015-06-18 11:58:42] Ardesco: Buck sounds too much like a Chiken waddling around a yard
[2015-06-18 11:58:52] Ardesco: Buck Buck BUCK
[2015-06-18 11:59:15] lukeis: buck buck Buck-BUCK :)
[2015-06-18 11:59:22] Ardesco: Oh I know why Selenium shouldn’t use those build tools.  It’s just frustrating that i can’t just check out type in a command and watch it all work
[2015-06-18 11:59:38] lukeis: i haven't had an issue ;)
[2015-06-18 12:02:02] mekhami: for python selenium, can i/should i directly change the value of an input rather than using send_keys to it? send_keys seems to take longer, and i want to reduce the time my test takes
[2015-06-18 12:02:17] sircapsalot: js
[2015-06-18 12:02:33] jimevans: mekhami: setting the value directly might not trigger all of the javascript events on the control
[2015-06-18 12:02:48] jimevans: you'll need to be responsible for that yourself.
[2015-06-18 12:02:49] sircapsalot: but using that doesn't execute it like the "user" does.. so it won't pick up those javascript events
[2015-06-18 12:02:54] mekhami: jimevans: in this case, if it's not a problem, any other drawback?
[2015-06-18 12:04:10] mekhami: i mean
[2015-06-18 12:04:13] mekhami: how do i even set the value directly
[2015-06-18 12:04:15] mekhami: rather than simulating keys
[2015-06-18 12:04:20] mekhami: is there a .value() method?
[2015-06-18 12:04:25] mekhami: the docs for python selenium are woefully incomplete :9
[2015-06-18 12:04:37] sircapsalot: python probably has something like execute_script
[2015-06-18 12:04:52] jimevans: mekhami: nope. you'll need to go straight to javascript, if your intention is to bypass the mechanisms that webdriver provides
[2015-06-18 12:04:55] sircapsalot: execute_script('document.findElementById("blah").value = "something"')
[2015-06-18 12:05:01] jimevans: and yeah, it's execute_script.
[2015-06-18 12:05:05] mekhami: ah no that's not where i wanna go
[2015-06-18 12:05:17] mekhami: hm.
[2015-06-18 12:05:22] mekhami: i guess send_keys it is
[2015-06-18 12:05:23] jimevans: well, those are your options.
[2015-06-18 12:05:27] mekhami: it's just so slow D=
[2015-06-18 12:05:44] jimevans: use sendkeys, or use javascript and be responsible for firing the events on your own.

[2015-06-18 14:31:28] Ardesco: :/
[2015-06-18 14:31:48] lukeis: but it looks like for "all"  …. "./go tests test_javascript"   will do it
[2015-06-18 14:31:50] jleyba: meh. we just haven't defined a target to run everything
[2015-06-18 14:31:51] Ardesco: which are the core ones to worry about FF?
[2015-06-18 14:31:59] jleyba: ./go test_firefox

[2015-06-18 14:32:35] lukeis: Ardesco: learn to read the Rakefile

[2015-06-18 14:33:09] lukeis:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-06-18 14:33:23] Ardesco: is there a really_matters target ? :)
[2015-06-18 14:34:40] Ardesco: you see the real problem is that i don’t do this often enough so i forget
[2015-06-18 14:35:10] lukeis: no, because it all depends on what "really matters" to you...
[2015-06-18 14:35:15] jleyba: if you're working on FF, just run "./go test_firefox test_javascript"
[2015-06-18 14:35:24] lukeis: for example I just ran the "./go test_py"  before my last change ;)

[2015-06-18 14:37:45] lukeis: or a ruby test if changing python? :-D
[2015-06-18 14:38:12] Ardesco: because i don’t know all the various bits of code hook into each other

[2015-06-18 14:43:12] jcun: was wondering if any of you use the https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageFactory in your frameworks?
[2015-06-18 14:43:35] lukeis: currently, no i do not
[2015-06-18 14:43:47] jcun: i c
[2015-06-18 14:43:53] lukeis: we have our own factory ;)
[2015-06-18 14:44:00] jcun: we ended up scratching ios-driver
[2015-06-18 14:44:01] jcun: oh yeah?
[2015-06-18 14:44:04] jcun: for pages?
[2015-06-18 14:44:07] lukeis: yes
[2015-06-18 14:44:10] jcun: why?
[2015-06-18 14:44:16] jcun: so you can pass in the driver to them?
[2015-06-18 14:44:21] jcun: what's the advantage
[2015-06-18 14:44:24] lukeis: similar to Selenium's PageFactory… but just specific to us
[2015-06-18 14:44:47] jcun: so did you extend theirs?
[2015-06-18 14:44:52] jcun: or just create one from scratch?
[2015-06-18 14:45:11] lukeis: from scratch
[2015-06-18 14:45:19] jcun: we are using appium now for ios
[2015-06-18 14:45:20] Ardesco_: I use pagefactory quite a lot
[2015-06-18 14:45:39] Ardesco_: generally it’s ok, the occasional StaleElementReferenceException is slightly annoying
[2015-06-18 14:45:42] jcun: one of our projects uses pagefactory but the projects i'm working on we didn't use it
[2015-06-18 14:46:07] jcun: i was just trying to find out the advantages of use the pagefactory were over not
[2015-06-18 14:46:11] jcun: or understand
[2015-06-18 14:46:55] Ardesco_: it’s already done for you i guess :)
[2015-06-18 14:47:09] Ardesco_: If somebody fixes stuff in it you get those changes for free
[2015-06-18 14:47:26] jcun: is it in a way just a more simple way to get to your pages?
[2015-06-18 14:47:37] jcun: and have the driver bundled with it?
[2015-06-18 14:48:03] jcun: i do like how the elements are found with the "How" attribute
