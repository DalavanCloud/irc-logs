[2015-06-05 05:28:30] sircapsalot: works for me.. that should work for you akafred
[2015-06-05 05:28:35] akafred: I can select the <md-select>-element, but havent figured out a way to make a choice from the <md-options>
[2015-06-05 05:29:19] WhereIsMySpoon: akafred: wrap it in a Select object
[2015-06-05 05:29:23] WhereIsMySpoon: might work
[2015-06-05 05:29:25] sircapsalot: yea, that's because it's uncommon to have an element like that.. what you are looking at is a custom dropdown, probably powered by javascript
[2015-06-05 05:29:36] anu_c, joining. (#selenium)

[2015-06-05 05:29:48] sircapsalot: or this ^
[2015-06-05 05:30:09] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont know if this will work
[2015-06-05 05:30:20] WhereIsMySpoon: it may not due to it not being a <select>

[2015-06-05 05:30:55] WhereIsMySpoon: i was about to look
[2015-06-05 05:30:55] sircapsalot: it has to be select
[2015-06-05 05:31:35] WhereIsMySpoon: you could create a subclass of Select
[2015-06-05 05:31:41] WhereIsMySpoon: that overrides the constructor
[2015-06-05 05:31:46] WhereIsMySpoon: or wherever that code that u just posted it
[2015-06-05 05:31:47] WhereIsMySpoon: is*
[2015-06-05 05:32:14] WhereIsMySpoon: or alternatively try what sircapsalot said earlier about clicking an <option> element
[2015-06-05 05:32:16] sircapsalot: or, just try my solution and see if your click() on the <md-option> works.. it might - depending on the javascript event listeners
[2015-06-05 05:32:17] WhereIsMySpoon: or md-option or whatever it is
[2015-06-05 05:32:23] WhereIsMySpoon: yah
[2015-06-05 05:32:36] WhereIsMySpoon: try that first

[2015-06-05 05:34:24] WhereIsMySpoon: due to not really being able to put ids on elements

[2015-06-05 05:37:50] WhereIsMySpoon: well selenium handles any element mostly fine
[2015-06-05 05:37:54] WhereIsMySpoon: its just that select is quite special
[2015-06-05 05:38:02] sircapsalot: looking more at the code though akafred.. if that clicking doesn't work.. it should be very simple to subclass "Select", override the constructor, as well as a couple of others like getOptions()  - just as WhereIsMySpoon said

[2015-06-05 05:43:18] WhereIsMySpoon: akafred: maybe take a look at protractor
[2015-06-05 05:44:05] akafred: Yeah, I've seen it. Might find som inspiration. Or I have to do some of my testing in JS.

[2015-06-05 06:49:11] Cerz: does anyone know if selenium CI on jenkins can run test suits written outside of the IDE? I'm reading through a few sites talking about and they all seem to expect the tests to be in html
[2015-06-05 06:50:17] jimevans: Cerz: of course. In fact, I'd say that's the more common use case.
[2015-06-05 06:50:48] jimevans: Now, if you're talking about a specific plugin for Jenkins, that may be different.
[2015-06-05 06:51:25] Cerz: Nah, no specific plugin
[2015-06-05 06:51:39] Cerz: Just looking into it so far
[2015-06-05 06:51:48] Cerz: but I've previously wrote my tests in java so wanted to be sure
[2015-06-05 06:51:52] Cerz: thanks jimevans
[2015-06-05 06:51:55] jimevans: But just as Jenkins can run regular unit tests written in whatever language, it can run similarly marked tests that utilize selenium.

[2015-06-05 12:04:13] lukeis: ato / AutomatedTester: does marionette work in Firefox Portable too?  issue that made me think to ask this… #618
[2015-06-05 12:05:54] AutomatedTester: lukeis: maybe...
[2015-06-05 12:06:43] AutomatedTester: lukeis: depends on how much of a bastardised gecko it is
[2015-06-05 12:06:59] lukeis: obviously there's some bastardization ;)
[2015-06-05 12:07:09] rorycb: What's the selenium required Java version? did it get bumped to 7?
[2015-06-05 12:07:19] lukeis: still at 6
[2015-06-05 12:07:33] lukeis: but i'm happy with 7
[2015-06-05 12:07:57] rorycb: lukeis: trying to deal with the BB10 Java launcher, don't want to use features that will break people
[2015-06-05 12:07:58] lukeis: if you want to run htmlunit you need 7
[2015-06-05 12:08:10] rorycb: oh, so I could say you need 7 to use it?
[2015-06-05 12:08:11] lukeis: eh, 7 is ok
[2015-06-05 12:08:16] lukeis: yes
[2015-06-05 12:08:25] lukeis: you could even say you need java 8 to use it :-D
[2015-06-05 12:08:37] rorycb: lukeis: that would be great, if Selenium officially supported it
[2015-06-05 12:08:45] blackboxd, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-05 12:08:46] rorycb: Java 8 adds Lambda :)
[2015-06-05 12:08:47] lukeis: the selenium standalone server will merely not load the browser type if run in a lower version of java
[2015-06-05 12:09:29] rorycb: Has java 8 been tested though? is it officially supported?
[2015-06-05 12:09:46] lukeis: yes… java 7 is officially EOL as of 2 months ago ;)

[2015-06-05 14:50:30] barancev: may be because it can't run more than one session :)

[2015-06-05 15:55:52] LocusAsaf: python + PageObject design question
[2015-06-05 15:56:01] LocusAsaf: my site has a main menu
[2015-06-05 15:57:44] LocusAsaf: so for instance the action to navigate to page X, is the same whether you are on page Y or page Z which both contain the main menu
[2015-06-05 15:58:22] LocusAsaf: so what I've done is define a function outside the page object that other page objects import
[2015-06-05 15:58:27] LocusAsaf: is that a sane way to approach
[2015-06-05 15:58:34] LocusAsaf: I'll paste an example to clarify
[2015-06-05 15:59:21] dude-x: LocusAsaf: i have a BasePage object that all page objects inherit
[2015-06-05 15:59:27] dude-x: if you have a top nav bar thingie
[2015-06-05 15:59:32] dude-x: that’s on all pages
[2015-06-05 15:59:42] LocusAsaf: its not all pages just a bunch
[2015-06-05 16:00:00] dude-x: then you can inherit that too. so class Dashboard(TopNavBar):...
[2015-06-05 16:00:09] dude-x: class TopNavBar(BasePage)
[2015-06-05 16:00:36] dude-x: well Python has mutliple inheritance so you can also do things like
[2015-06-05 16:00:49] dude-x: class Dashboard(Top Nav Bar, Left Nav Bar):
[2015-06-05 16:01:01] dude-x: just make sure the methods don’t clash :)
[2015-06-05 16:01:07] LocusAsaf: okay gotcha
[2015-06-05 16:01:11] LocusAsaf: that makes sense
[2015-06-05 16:02:28] AutomatedTester: LocusAsaf: at Mozilla we also have inner classes that might give us details about that
[2015-06-05 16:02:53] LocusAsaf: inner classes?
[2015-06-05 16:03:02] AutomatedTester: a class within a class
[2015-06-05 16:03:06] LocusAsaf: a class defined in a class?
[2015-06-05 16:03:13] AutomatedTester: https://github.com/mozilla/Addon-Tests/blob/master/pages/desktop/addons_site.py#L42
[2015-06-05 16:03:13] dude-x: someone wrote an inner class in one of my page objects at a prior job. beautiful code, made it hard to make changes.
[2015-06-05 16:04:09] dude-x: that snippet from mozilla makes sense
[2015-06-05 16:04:27] LocusAsaf: AutomatedTester: what does the @property decorator do?
[2015-06-05 16:05:05] dude-x: LocusAsaf: say you have a function called get_text(); with @property, you can just write: thing.get_text # no parantheses
[2015-06-05 16:05:28] AutomatedTester: and you can get rid of get_
[2015-06-05 16:05:33] dude-x: true.
[2015-06-05 16:05:41] dude-x: java has infected my brain.
[2015-06-05 16:05:49] LocusAsaf: alrighty
[2015-06-05 16:05:56] AutomatedTester: it allows you to write idiomatic python
[2015-06-05 16:06:01] dude-x: with a setter, you can do this in python x.thing = y
[2015-06-05 16:06:39] LocusAsaf: also, I've seen a few examples of By.CSS_ID or By.CSS_SOMETHING what's the benefit of that?
[2015-06-05 16:07:04] LocusAsaf: versus just doing button_css = '.special_button'

[2015-06-05 16:08:34] LocusAsaf: because either way find_element(review_text_locator) will work right?
[2015-06-05 16:08:40] AutomatedTester: LocusAsaf: its a tuple so it is immutable so can't be change by accident
[2015-06-05 16:09:04] AutomatedTester: and then you just put it into driver.find_element(*_review_text_locator)
[2015-06-05 16:09:24] AutomatedTester: and python will expand the tuple into 2 arguments needed for find_element
[2015-06-05 16:09:32] LocusAsaf: got it
[2015-06-05 16:10:12] AutomatedTester: this way, we change locators near the top and not through out the file
[2015-06-05 16:10:57] AutomatedTester: if we wanted to move from class name to css selector or vice versa, we just need to change the By.*
[2015-06-05 16:11:11] LocusAsaf: hmm right I guess in my experience everything is css whetther its by id or by class or whatever

[2015-06-05 16:13:21] dude-x: xpath: it looks like this //div[@class=“thing”]
[2015-06-05 16:13:23] LocusAsaf: then I tell them nope
[2015-06-05 16:13:38] dude-x: sometimes it’s the only way to locate an element in a generic way
[2015-06-05 16:13:55] *lukeis bashes it with understand and seeing the horrors it caused fool-harty, unknowing testers'
[2015-06-05 16:13:57] dude-x: you don’t want to write a css selector that is going to depend on a very particular structure
[2015-06-05 16:14:28] LocusAsaf: well I won't go down this route much more
[2015-06-05 16:14:38] dude-x: lukeis: yeah i’ve seen some bad xpaths (aside from copying and pasting what a tool returns) but things like ::sibling: ::descendent
[2015-06-05 16:14:42] lukeis: i've seen the horror…. the horror
[2015-06-05 16:14:45] LocusAsaf: but anyway, our front end is very dynamic
[2015-06-05 16:14:50] dude-x: and then you’re just like “F##$ i have to trace this"
[2015-06-05 16:15:02] LocusAsaf: so instead of chaining driver.find_elements
[2015-06-05 16:15:08] dude-x: but other times i just say REWRITE!
[2015-06-05 16:15:34] LocusAsaf: we use selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions
[2015-06-05 16:15:35] lukeis: like a property file that contained "all the locators" for all the tests and only allowed one type of locator…. xpath
[2015-06-05 16:15:50] dude-x: i like chaining find_elements (but it’s only one layer down)
[2015-06-05 16:16:03] LocusAsaf: and just wait for the actual thing we want to be clickable
[2015-06-05 16:16:09] LocusAsaf: instead of looking at some other thing
[2015-06-05 16:16:17] LocusAsaf: if that makes sense
[2015-06-05 16:16:33] swampdragons, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-05 16:17:18] dude-x: LocusAsaf: well waiting for things is actually dependent on the code ran on the page
[2015-06-05 16:17:39] dude-x: sometimes you have to wait for intermediate elements before you can interact with some element.

[2015-06-05 16:18:03] LocusAsaf: true
[2015-06-05 16:18:40] LocusAsaf: but I have to say that this custom find_css we wrote works really well by using webdriver waits and that expected_conditions stuff
[2015-06-05 16:19:03] LocusAsaf: its much more full proof than just locating lots of elements using the plain find built into driver
[2015-06-05 16:19:23] jleyba, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2015-06-05 16:19:41] dude-x: yeah i use a wrapped driver

[2015-06-05 16:23:23] LocusAsaf: AutomatedTester: I don't quite get what you're getting by adding these inner classes
[2015-06-05 16:23:32] LocusAsaf: just further organization
[2015-06-05 16:23:41] AutomatedTester: that's it really
[2015-06-05 16:23:48] LocusAsaf: do you re-use these inner classes in other modules?
[2015-06-05 16:24:02] AutomatedTester: not really
[2015-06-05 16:24:18] LocusAsaf: so its just to kind of indicate this a special section of the page?
[2015-06-05 16:24:24] AutomatedTester: yes
[2015-06-05 16:24:41] AutomatedTester: we have other snippets that are on all pages
[2015-06-05 16:24:46] LocusAsaf: that's why you mentioned this in regards to menu bars?
[2015-06-05 16:25:04] AutomatedTester: if things should be on all pages then a base page will have it
[2015-06-05 16:25:09] LocusAsaf: it's not really a good candidate for something you want to repeat (and avoid code duplication)
[2015-06-05 16:25:17] LocusAsaf: yeah the base page seems like a better soln
[2015-06-05 16:25:20] cylon512, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-05 16:25:53] AutomatedTester: we do it all :)
[2015-06-05 16:27:17] LocusAsaf: another general question
[2015-06-05 16:27:54] LocusAsaf: actually nvm
[2015-06-05 16:28:03] LocusAsaf: okay wait
[2015-06-05 16:28:09] AutomatedTester: hammer time
[2015-06-05 16:28:25] LocusAsaf: so suppose that I've created a common function in a base page
[2015-06-05 16:28:27] pte_petey: hello #selenium
[2015-06-05 16:28:31] LocusAsaf: that navigates to page X
[2015-06-05 16:28:34] pte_petey: i got slaughtered in my interview today :(
[2015-06-05 16:28:59] lukeis: :(
[2015-06-05 16:29:02] LocusAsaf: however if I'm on page Z and I re-use nav-to-page-x
[2015-06-05 16:29:11] LocusAsaf: I actually get booted to page Y
[2015-06-05 16:29:43] LocusAsaf: the re-used code to navigate to page_x returns a pageX object which isn't what we are expecting
[2015-06-05 16:29:54] LocusAsaf: what do you suggest, override the function?
[2015-06-05 16:30:05] pte_petey: 90% of the questions were on automation
[2015-06-05 16:30:14] pte_petey: only 10% on high level python
[2015-06-05 16:30:44] lukeis: at least you didn't get, revers a string or manipulate a linked list ;)

[2015-06-05 16:31:15] pte_petey: yea
[2015-06-05 16:31:29] pte_petey: there was some things on the grid which threw me because i didn't do that
[2015-06-05 16:31:36] pte_petey: how to upload and download files using selenium
[2015-06-05 16:31:51] pte_petey: if a window appears in ajax how would you switch to and select that button
[2015-06-05 16:31:51] lukeis: :downloads
[2015-06-05 16:31:55] lukeis: :-D
[2015-06-05 16:32:12] pte_petey: what steps do you take after manual testing is complete and before you write an automated test
[2015-06-05 16:32:17] AutomatedTester: pte_petey: if you said you don't then it's all good
[2015-06-05 16:32:31] pte_petey: what is the difference between webdriver and webeventdriver
[2015-06-05 16:32:45] AutomatedTester: LOLWAT?
[2015-06-05 16:32:46] pte_petey: how does webdriver communicate with the browser
[2015-06-05 16:32:58] lukeis: what's webeventdriver? ;) maybe FiringEventWebDriver?
[2015-06-05 16:33:04] pte_petey: i think maybe that
[2015-06-05 16:33:12] pte_petey: something with driver and event in it
[2015-06-05 16:33:28] pte_petey: what's the difference between using grid and a stand alone server - benefits/disadvantages
[2015-06-05 16:33:28] lukeis: where were you interviewing?
[2015-06-05 16:33:34] pte_petey: NTT
[2015-06-05 16:33:51] pte_petey: for a company called headforwards
[2015-06-05 16:34:05] pte_petey: what is a decorator and why would you use it
[2015-06-05 16:34:18] pte_petey: how would you get key value pairs from a map - i should've said items() ?
[2015-06-05 16:34:30] AutomatedTester: some of these questions are pointless
[2015-06-05 16:34:37] pte_petey: lol
[2015-06-05 16:34:47] pte_petey: let me think what else
[2015-06-05 16:34:52] lukeis: iteritems?  … forgets my python ;)
[2015-06-05 16:35:02] LocusAsaf: my experience in interviewing people personally is that these questions are just to see at what temperature people boil
[2015-06-05 16:35:19] pte_petey: does python override and overload
[2015-06-05 16:35:21] AutomatedTester: I would have been laughing my head off...
[2015-06-05 16:35:26] pte_petey: i said it overloaded but not overriding
[2015-06-05 16:35:27] pte_petey: TT
[2015-06-05 16:35:30] LocusAsaf: its okay if they dont know but if they start boiling its a bad sign
[2015-06-05 16:35:53] pte_petey: because it doesn't let you overload constructors like in java
[2015-06-05 16:35:54] lukeis: i do like to ask questions to see how far their knowledge goes, but usually only to know what they don't know… and I don't consider a bad thing to find their limit :)
[2015-06-05 16:36:27] pte_petey: actually i think the interviewer was the one boiling over with me
[2015-06-05 16:36:35] AutomatedTester: "how does webdriver communicate with the browser" <- WebDriver developers took care in building the libraries so you never have to know....
[2015-06-05 16:36:37] pte_petey: i was just answering or hazzarding a guess
[2015-06-05 16:36:51] pte_petey: AutomatedTester i said it had something to do with bindings
[2015-06-05 16:37:08] pte_petey: but then he asked me some other question on bindings and i was like uhhhhh ??
[2015-06-05 16:37:23] lukeis: response: "do you work on the Selenium project, is this an interview for working on the OSS project?" :)
[2015-06-05 16:37:24] LocusAsaf: that actually is an interesting question
[2015-06-05 16:37:36] pte_petey: haha
[2015-06-05 16:38:22] pte_petey: describes the steps for testing
[2015-06-05 16:38:28] pte_petey: in waterfall or agile
[2015-06-05 16:38:39] *AutomatedTester feels his meme generator warming up...'
[2015-06-05 16:38:48] pte_petey: lol
[2015-06-05 16:38:52] pte_petey: please do ;)
[2015-06-05 16:41:11] lukeis: i don't look forward to potentially having to interview somewhere else someday… i feel like I may walk out on a few companies before finding a good one ;)
[2015-06-05 16:41:48] LocusAsaf: lukeis: if you have that luxary it's quite good
[2015-06-05 16:42:04] pte_petey: the company i wanna work for is 100% awesome
[2015-06-05 16:42:23] pte_petey: but we'll have to see if it's a yay or a nay
[2015-06-05 16:42:39] AutomatedTester: lukeis: I am in the same boat
[2015-06-05 16:42:43] lukeis: i don't want to work a 100% awesome company…. they might puke rainbows from unicorns on me
[2015-06-05 16:42:46] pte_petey: I've got some other potentials in ireland
[2015-06-05 16:42:57] pte_petey: all part of the hazzard pay
[2015-06-05 16:43:00] AutomatedTester: I suspect I will take the same route as Adam
[2015-06-05 16:43:19] lukeis: cto by day, consultant by night? ;)
