[2015-06-10 08:19:58] jimevans: lilalinuxHamburg: what kind of elements?
[2015-06-10 08:20:12] lilalinuxHamburg: <span>footext</span>
[2015-06-10 08:20:32] barancev: because invisible
[2015-06-10 08:20:38] lilalinuxHamburg: no, the text is visible
[2015-06-10 08:20:50] lilalinuxHamburg: I even highlighted the span via selenium
[2015-06-10 08:20:55] jimevans: absent css styling and javascript manipulation of the attributes and text of the element, that *shouldn't* be the case, assuming you've identified the correct element.
[2015-06-10 08:20:58] lilalinuxHamburg: to check if it is the right element
[2015-06-10 08:21:30] jimevans: but i'm still a bit skeptical. i'd need to see a full example of this happening to be convinced.
[2015-06-10 08:22:05] lilalinuxHamburg: <span class="rtIn" style="background-color:red">Cockpit_Menu</span>
[2015-06-10 08:22:09] lilalinuxHamburg: this is the exact html
[2015-06-10 08:22:14] gabecase, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-10 08:22:18] lilalinuxHamburg: the background-color:red has been set via selenium
[2015-06-10 08:22:40] WhereIsMySpoon: lilalinuxHamburg: and how are you trying to select
[2015-06-10 08:22:59] lilalinuxHamburg: span.getText()
[2015-06-10 08:23:08] WhereIsMySpoon: oh i see
[2015-06-10 08:23:08] lilalinuxHamburg: Where span is the WebElement
[2015-06-10 08:23:15] jimevans: lilalinuxHamburg: that's not enough. i mean a full example. full page of HTML, and the webdriver code that fails to show the text. there are just too many other variables without that full level of information.
[2015-06-10 08:23:32] WhereIsMySpoon: :sscce
[2015-06-10 08:24:16] WhereIsMySpoon: :gist
[2015-06-10 08:25:46] lilalinuxHamburg: apparently others have similar problems: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20888592/gettext-method-of-selenium-chrome-driver-sometimes-returns-an-empty-string but the workaround with innerText doesn't work for me
[2015-06-10 08:27:47] jimevans: lilalinuxHamburg: you're right, in that it seems like the situation as you've described it shouldn't be happening. that means there are two possibilities. first, there's a bug in the driver you're using. this is a possibility, but i presume you've ruled that out by testing on multiple browsers, eliminated potential timing issues, and made sure the element in question is scrolled into the view port when you call getText().
[2015-06-10 08:28:26] jimevans: the other possibility is that there's something unique to this *specific* web page that's not allowing the driver to pick up on the text of this particular element.
[2015-06-10 08:29:23] jimevans: without seeing the entirety of the page, or at least one that acts similarly, there's no way for anyone who works on webdriver to be sure where the issue is.
[2015-06-10 08:29:48] lilalinuxHamburg: yeah, I thought it might be a known issue
[2015-06-10 08:30:33] lilalinuxHamburg: got it
[2015-06-10 08:30:55] lilalinuxHamburg: I read that in some cases you have to click the element before evaluating it's text
[2015-06-10 08:31:13] jimevans: only in that .click() will cause it to be scrolled into the view port.
[2015-06-10 08:31:19] jimevans: thus making it visible.
[2015-06-10 08:32:17] rananda, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2015-06-10 08:32:24] lilalinuxHamburg: but it is visible
[2015-06-10 08:32:46] WhereIsMySpoon: -sigh-
[2015-06-10 08:32:52] jimevans: lilalinuxHamburg: define "visible"
[2015-06-10 08:32:53] yenaemj_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-10 08:32:54] WhereIsMySpoon: lilalinuxHamburg: visible to you does not mean what it means to webdriver
[2015-06-10 08:33:19] WhereIsMySpoon: lilalinuxHamburg: if the element is not actually in the viewport (i.e. you can see it on the page) then it is definitely not visible at that point in time
[2015-06-10 08:33:42] WhereIsMySpoon: lilalinuxHamburg: also, if there are overlapping elements on top of it that are maybe a very light colour or have no colour but still overlap, it could be not visible to webdriver
[2015-06-10 08:33:52] lilalinuxHamburg: I see
[2015-06-10 08:33:58] WhereIsMySpoon: visibility is hard
[2015-06-10 08:34:13] WhereIsMySpoon: think about it programmatically
[2015-06-10 08:34:21] WhereIsMySpoon: not just from your point of view
[2015-06-10 08:34:30] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium isnt a human
[2015-06-10 08:34:59] lilalinuxHamburg: ok, so I always have to check visibility before evaluating
[2015-06-10 08:35:18] WhereIsMySpoon: you should be checking visibility before doing pretty much most actions on elements
[2015-06-10 08:35:31] WhereIsMySpoon: imo

[2015-06-10 08:36:22] WhereIsMySpoon: very basic example: driver.get("mysite.com"); driver.findElement(By.id("loginButton")).click();
[2015-06-10 08:36:24] jimevans: personally, i think it's pretty dumb to have elements that are visible except for being scrolled into view not return the text via getText(). but that opinion flies in the face of others.
[2015-06-10 08:36:28] WhereIsMySpoon: OOPS the login button isnt there yet
[2015-06-10 08:36:32] WhereIsMySpoon: error
[2015-06-10 08:36:34] WhereIsMySpoon: your test fails
[2015-06-10 08:36:42] WhereIsMySpoon: basic example
[2015-06-10 08:36:46] WhereIsMySpoon: but u get the idea
[2015-06-10 08:37:27] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: you'd think it would at least attempt to scroll it into view
[2015-06-10 08:37:42] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: that, too, gets tricky.
[2015-06-10 08:38:13] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: no more so than for trying to click surely
[2015-06-10 08:38:43] jimevans: simply calling element.scrollIntoView() in javascript will work to do that. but if the element is located in the overflow area of a block element where overflow: hidden, it shouldn't be scrolled into view, because the user would be unable to do so,
[2015-06-10 08:39:37] WhereIsMySpoon: oh..hm
[2015-06-10 08:39:40] jimevans: i'm also not entirely sure i'd want autoscroll on getText(), but again, that's just my opinion.
[2015-06-10 08:40:09] WhereIsMySpoon: in that case I could make a strong argument for not returning all the text inside
[2015-06-10 08:40:15] WhereIsMySpoon: if its been cut off
[2015-06-10 08:40:21] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe you want to test the overflow hiding
[2015-06-10 08:41:23] jimevans: it's actually a bit more complicated than that, but you get the idea.
[2015-06-10 08:41:50] jimevans: visibility is hard. let's go shopping.

[2015-06-10 13:20:30] lukeis: barancev: i googledâ€¦. found this post ;) https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2013/06/automated-testing-using-selenium-at-salesforce.html
[2015-06-10 13:20:34] lukeis: read the first comment

[2015-06-10 13:21:15] jimevans: hey that blog post looks familiar...
[2015-06-10 13:21:22] lukeis: indeed! :)
[2015-06-10 13:21:41] sohlemac: lol
[2015-06-10 13:22:10] sohlemac: I'm still stuck on what a "curing engine" is...
[2015-06-10 13:22:19] lukeis: same here
[2015-06-10 13:22:57] lukeis: i think it's something lost in translation
[2015-06-10 13:23:07] barancev: it "can cure a recorded test case for all the problems" :)
[2015-06-10 13:24:28] jimevans: it presupposes that a test case recorded with Selenium IDE is "sick" and needs to be "cured". not entirely sure i disagree
[2015-06-10 13:25:29] lukeis: I have a curing engine for IDE testsâ€¦. it's called "rm"

[2015-06-10 14:16:42] arohner: is there any way to clean those up manually?
[2015-06-10 14:16:53] arohner: or detect 'leaked' browsers by asking the server?

[2015-06-10 14:21:28] D3M0S: arohner, I was going to just have it do the clean up routine after every so many tests
[2015-06-10 14:21:35] D3M0S: like bring down that node and restart it
