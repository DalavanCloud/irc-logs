[2015-06-01 09:19:40] alko: mekhami: when a developer commits a change, jenkins will pick up the change, build and deploy the latest version of the software to aws, then launch a browser node which connects to it
[2015-06-01 09:20:12] alko: mekhami: there may be some advantages to doing so when it comes to network security layers, yeah

[2015-06-01 10:48:21] lukeis: ato: why would Firefox 31.6.0 report it's user agent string as 31.0 :'(   sigh…
[2015-06-01 10:48:35] ato: lukeis: I don’t know.
[2015-06-01 10:48:56] ato: Generally you shouldn’t rely on the UA string.
[2015-06-01 10:49:08] lukeis: we don't… it just helps us in debugging our environment
[2015-06-01 10:49:10] ato: But rather do feature detection.
[2015-06-01 10:49:30] lukeis: like for me to tell that tests are really running on 31.6 as opposed to 31.0
[2015-06-01 10:49:54] lukeis: i had to manually watch a VM run to confirm it was 31.6 instead of just checking the user agent string in the results
[2015-06-01 10:50:50] ato: Can’t really find anything on Bugzilla because the search is so terrible.
[2015-06-01 10:51:06] lukeis: yeah, closest thing I found was related to FF 18
[2015-06-01 10:51:33] lukeis: it's not a big enough bug for me to care about logging though… but enough for me to complain to you on IRC ;)
[2015-06-01 10:51:37] ato: You should think that the UA string would be automatically generated though.
[2015-06-01 10:51:58] lukeis: in case you care more, this is on Windows 7
[2015-06-01 10:52:07] ato: I’m all ears for complaining (-:  We all need it.

[2015-06-01 11:21:01] LocusAsaf: do you combine those three/four steps into a helper function that you can reuse in several tests?

[2015-06-01 11:25:12] New2Selenium: its a link to the product page..i dont know how do i click on it..
[2015-06-01 11:25:27] dude-x: LocusAsaf: oh yeah i do login_page.LoginPage(driver); then login_page.sign_as_user();
[2015-06-01 11:25:42] dude-x: err login_page = LoginPage(driver)
[2015-06-01 11:25:55] jimevans: New2Selenium: find it, then click on it. i'm being cryptic on purpose, hoping you'll be able to figure some things out for yourself.
[2015-06-01 11:26:08] jimevans: what is making it "unfindable?"
[2015-06-01 11:26:13] LocusAsaf: dude-x: cool, and how do you feel about putting 3 or 4 common steps into a helper function that is reused in tests?
[2015-06-01 11:26:25] dude-x: LocusAsaf: that’s fine
[2015-06-01 11:26:29] LocusAsaf: dude-x: supposedly this helper function returns a page object that the helper function lands on
[2015-06-01 11:26:35] LocusAsaf: okay cool
[2015-06-01 11:26:35] dude-x: but i prefer being explicit
[2015-06-01 11:26:45] jimevans: New2Selenium: or to put it another way, what, in the attributes of the element, would identify it uniquely on the page so that you can find it?
[2015-06-01 11:26:49] LocusAsaf: so you'll just re-do the same 3 or 4 steps in every test
[2015-06-01 11:26:49] LocusAsaf: ?
[2015-06-01 11:28:16] New2Selenium: ok so there is this uniquie id number given in the code
[2015-06-01 11:28:39] New2Selenium: but it doesnt work when i use findelementbyID
[2015-06-01 11:29:08] New2Selenium: its given as data-id ="Value"
[2015-06-01 11:29:11] jimevans: no, it wouldn't, because it's not the "id" attribute of the element (which would just be named "id")

[2015-06-01 11:29:27] New2Selenium: right
[2015-06-01 11:29:46] jimevans: wouldn't it be great if there were some search mechanism that allowed you to find elements based on the values of attributes?
[2015-06-01 11:29:57] jimevans: i wonder if such a thing might exists.
[2015-06-01 11:29:58] Guest80447, changing nick to D3M0S.
[2015-06-01 11:30:28] New2Selenium: I tried firebug but that didnt help either..
[2015-06-01 11:30:37] jimevans: i know that some web designers style things differently using cascading style sheets (css) based on attributes of elements.
[2015-06-01 11:30:43] dude-x: LocusAsaf: the next thing i want to do is make page objects fixtures
[2015-06-01 11:30:46] dude-x: but i haven’t figured it out
[2015-06-01 11:31:46] New2Selenium: there is another unique number given in the div class but i dont know how can use it to find the element..
[2015-06-01 11:32:02] LocusAsaf: dude-x: if you make them fixtures you can automatically pass the driver into them but then you also have to pass them directly into your tests
[2015-06-01 11:32:06] LocusAsaf: I think anyway
[2015-06-01 11:32:07] jimevans: New2Selenium: i point you to my last three comments.
[2015-06-01 11:32:46] jimevans: let me put it another way. if you were in the browser's javascript developer console and you wanted to find the element using javascript, how would you do it?
[2015-06-01 11:33:49] New2Selenium: you mean inspect the element?
[2015-06-01 11:34:11] jimevans: no, i mean what javascript would you execute to find the element?
[2015-06-01 11:34:41] jimevans: for example, to find an element by ID using javascript only (not using selenium webdriver), i'd use document.getElementById('my id i'm looking for')
[2015-06-01 11:34:42] New2Selenium: let me think
[2015-06-01 11:35:06] jimevans: obviously that wouldn't work here, because the element has no ID attribute.
[2015-06-01 11:35:34] New2Selenium: hmm i see
[2015-06-01 11:35:46] jimevans: but surely there must be another way, since web developers do this kind of thing all the time, right?

[2015-06-01 11:37:55] jimevans: New2Selenium: have you ever heard of CSS selectors?
[2015-06-01 11:38:01] New2Selenium: what is the significance of the value that you put in () for document.getElementById
[2015-06-01 11:38:08] New2Selenium: yes
[2015-06-01 11:38:12] New2Selenium: i have
[2015-06-01 11:38:24] jimevans: would it be possible to use CSS selectors to accomplish what you'd want?
[2015-06-01 11:38:56] New2Selenium: yeah i think so
[2015-06-01 11:38:58] jimevans: i'm ignoring your question about getElementById, because you're focused solely on the details, and not grasping the concept.
[2015-06-01 11:39:01] nofacade, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-01 11:39:30] New2Selenium: ok so the CSS selectors
[2015-06-01 11:40:12] jimevans: if i were in your shoes, i'd probably use something like findElement(By.cssSelector("a[data-id='<put your data id here>']")
[2015-06-01 11:40:25] jimevans: how would i figure out that's the right CSS selector?
[2015-06-01 11:40:43] jimevans: i'd use the browser's javascript developer console to attempt to execute the following:
[2015-06-01 11:41:05] jimevans: document.querySelector("a[data-id='<my data id>']")
[2015-06-01 11:41:16] jimevans: and see if it returned a valid element or an error.
[2015-06-01 11:41:41] jimevans: if it returned an element, i know i can use that css selector (what's inside the quotation marks) in my webdriver code
[2015-06-01 11:42:27] jimevans: note that the stuff in angle brackets is just there as a placeholder. in your specific case, you'd want to substitute your real values.
[2015-06-01 11:43:00] New2Selenium: i put the data-id in and it returned null
[2015-06-01 11:43:41] jimevans: can you paste the exact code you tried to use?
[2015-06-01 11:43:53] New2Selenium: document.querySelector("a[data-id='<32709>']")
[2015-06-01 11:44:00] jimevans: no angle brackets there
[2015-06-01 11:44:32] jimevans: is the value of the data-id attribute "<32709>"? no, it's not. the value of the data-id attribute is "32709"
[2015-06-01 11:44:41] New2Selenium: ok so it returned the same code that is given as a source code
[2015-06-01 11:44:52] New2Selenium: right
[2015-06-01 11:45:05] jimevans: so you know then that the css selector returns the proper element, and you can now use it in your webdriver code
[2015-06-01 11:46:42] New2Selenium: trying
[2015-06-01 11:48:33] New2Selenium: throwing an error
[2015-06-01 11:48:47] New2Selenium: says no such element
[2015-06-01 11:49:15] New2Selenium: driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("a[data-id='32709']")).click();
[2015-06-01 11:50:26] jimevans: okay add the following line of code ***FOR DEBUGGING PURPOSES ONLY*** just before the findElement call in your java code:
[2015-06-01 11:50:34] jimevans: Thread.sleep(5000);
[2015-06-01 11:50:40] chris-broes, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-01 11:51:00] jimevans: if this succeeds, then you know that you have a timing issue, and you'll need to use an appropriate wait mechanism.
[2015-06-01 11:51:35] New2Selenium: ohk
[2015-06-01 11:51:41] jleyba: when in doubt, sleep
[2015-06-01 11:52:16] jimevans: jleyba: fine advice for many aspects of life.
[2015-06-01 11:52:49] New2Selenium: Amazing :)
[2015-06-01 11:53:01] New2Selenium: jimevans its working now
[2015-06-01 11:53:10] jimevans: New2Selenium: no, it's not.
[2015-06-01 11:53:14] jimevans: let me be very clear
[2015-06-01 11:53:18] jimevans: the Thread.sleep()
[2015-06-01 11:53:26] jimevans: is a HUGE code smell, and bad practice.
[2015-06-01 11:53:28] New2Selenium: really what is the problem now?
[2015-06-01 11:53:31] dude-x: LocusAsaf: ideally it would be nice to write def test_thing(login_page, dashboard): then just say login_page.login(), dashboard.click_stuff() when page objects are fixtures
[2015-06-01 11:53:46] jimevans: New2Selenium: the problem is the hard-coded Thread.sleep()
[2015-06-01 11:54:06] dude-x: at a prior job, our page objects were “auto-wired” with the driver in Java
[2015-06-01 11:54:12] jimevans: i've tried very hard to emphasize that is a very VERY temporary workaround.
[2015-06-01 11:54:23] jimevans: you will now need to use a more appropriate waiting mechanism.
[2015-06-01 11:54:39] michl68, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-01 11:54:43] LocusAsaf: dude-x: how could you be both on the login page & the dashboard though?
[2015-06-01 11:54:45] jimevans: i suggest investigating the WebDriverWait class, which is the preferred route.
[2015-06-01 11:54:52] New2Selenium: makes sense
[2015-06-01 11:55:03] jimevans: but i have reached the limit of what i'm willing to help with at the moment.
[2015-06-01 11:55:08] New2Selenium: i will have to do some learning on the waiting mechanism
[2015-06-01 11:55:25] LocusAsaf: dude-x: I can imagine test_thing(login_page): would be pretty straight forward but not two page objects, because you can theoretically not have two page objects active at once
[2015-06-01 11:55:33] dude-x: LocusAsaf: if they’re py.test fixtures, it just loads the page objects that i specify
[2015-06-01 11:55:42] New2Selenium: so this is not the ideal way of doing this..
[2015-06-01 11:55:59] dude-x: LocusAsaf: the thing i would have to code is that all the page object fixtures would use the same driver
[2015-06-01 11:56:02] jimevans: New2Selenium: the simpler mechanism is to enable what's called implicit waits (a search will turn up what that is), but i prefer something more explicit so as to express the intent of my code.
[2015-06-01 11:56:09] dude-x: LocusAsaf: so it’s not impossible
[2015-06-01 11:56:13] LocusAsaf: dude-x: but if you're testing the login page & the dashboard you have to log in first though so how can the dashboard page be initialized before you log in?
[2015-06-01 11:56:34] New2Selenium: Right
[2015-06-01 11:56:53] jimevans: New2Selenium: no, you're doing it right. it's just that the web application hasn't had time to add the product <a> element into the DOM by the time you try to look for it with your findElement call
[2015-06-01 11:56:54] dude-x: LocusAsaf: a simple page object should only interact with the page, the actual driver in use is just a variable
[2015-06-01 11:57:35] dude-x: LocusAsaf: it shouldn’t care about the actual driver in use, so long as you give it a reference to one in the constructor
[2015-06-01 11:57:38] jimevans: you need to adjust for that, because there is no "one-size-fits-all" approach that will work for all websites to wait for elements to appear, given today's modern web technologies.
[2015-06-01 11:58:06] jimevans: in fact, i'd go so far as to say there's not even a "one-size-fits-most" approach. which is why this stuff gets complicated.
[2015-06-01 11:58:15] New2Selenium: so once we figure out a number to put for the wait, Can we use the same number for other elements for the same web application?
[2015-06-01 11:58:23] LocusAsaf: dude-x: gotcha
[2015-06-01 11:58:24] dude-x: LocusAsaf: a page object’s only dependency is having a refernece to a drivre, it should not care about what’s goign on in the browser
[2015-06-01 11:58:36] jimevans: New2Selenium: if only that were so.
[2015-06-01 11:58:43] LocusAsaf: dude-x: yes it should be possible, but the dashboard object won't be usable until you log in so it could be a little confusing
[2015-06-01 11:58:43] New2Selenium: i see
[2015-06-01 11:58:58] LocusAsaf: dude-x: I see what you're saying though
[2015-06-01 11:59:04] dude-x: LocusAsaf: some people do fancy things that page objects do depend on the state of the browser, but that’s something harder to set up
[2015-06-01 11:59:17] dude-x: and i don’t even understand how that works
[2015-06-01 11:59:27] jimevans: New2Selenium: incidentally, here's why a hard-coded Thread.sleep is bad.
[2015-06-01 12:00:44] jimevans: New2Selenium: consider the case where you always say Thread.sleep(5000). now suppose the element you're looking for shows up after 1 second. every time you call that code, you're wasting 4 seconds.
[2015-06-01 12:00:46] jimevans:  every. single. time.
[2015-06-01 12:01:16] New2Selenium: thats true
[2015-06-01 12:01:34] New2Selenium: you never know what element will show up at what speed
[2015-06-01 12:02:05] jimevans: implicit waits and so-called "explicit waits" (as defined by WebDriverWait) both work around that issue, waiting only as long as necessary up to the specified timeout.

[2015-06-01 12:02:47] New2Selenium: nice
[2015-06-01 12:03:34] dude-x: LocusAsaf: anyway for a given test (or module) you load the page objects you will use.
[2015-06-01 12:03:57] dude-x: LocusAsaf: some people do fluent page objects where every action returns the page object
[2015-06-01 12:04:06] dude-x: then that strategy may not work

[2015-06-01 12:05:11] LocusAsaf: dude-x: yeah someone was showing me that all the links or navigation from one page to another returns that respective page object
[2015-06-01 12:05:19] LocusAsaf: it definitely makes the tests flow look clear
[2015-06-01 12:06:09] dude-x: i don’t know if that looks clear...
[2015-06-01 12:06:21] New2Selenium: jimevans Thank you very much, I really appreciate you time and help
[2015-06-01 12:06:35] jimevans: New2Selenium: np. glad i could help.
[2015-06-01 12:07:16] dude-x: also the traceback/stacktrace is noisy when tests fail if you have code that looks like “page.login().click_thing.type(‘that’).click_this(). (what pages are being operated at this stage?)
[2015-06-01 12:09:05] New2Selenium: I just have another quick question. I am using chrome emulator to test this mobile website. The problem is that this mobile web is being supported by firefox( it doesnt display all the pages contents)
[2015-06-01 12:09:35] New2Selenium: So i am not being able to use the Selenium IDE to record the actions.. Is there a workaround for this?
[2015-06-01 12:09:52] New2Selenium: not*
[2015-06-01 12:11:13] LocusAsaf: dude-x: well in python you can inline a lot of functions but its up to the programmer to keep things clear
[2015-06-01 12:11:22] LocusAsaf: agree though that looks quite ugly
[2015-06-01 12:11:43] dude-x: that’s fluent style
[2015-06-01 12:11:54] dude-x: WebDriverWait is actually a fluent wait class though
[2015-06-01 12:12:27] dude-x: so i do write WebDriverWait(driver, global_timeout).until(...)

[2015-06-01 12:27:39] sjmikem: When running tests with selenium on a Mac, tests pass fine.
[2015-06-01 12:28:30] sjmikem: When running them on an ubuntu server (same version of Chrome, webdriver, and selenium server), tests think that the modal dialog is active when it isn't
[2015-06-01 12:28:31] sjmikem: and thus preventing clicks on other elements on the page

[2015-06-01 13:32:56] dude-x: LocusAsaf: it’s not kosher what you’re doing
[2015-06-01 13:33:09] LocusAsaf: sorry how come?
[2015-06-01 13:33:27] dude-x: let me gist what should be proper
[2015-06-01 13:33:40] LocusAsaf: dude-x: much obliged
[2015-06-01 13:34:00] LocusAsaf: dude-x: keep in mind in that gist there are two examples, one is a class & one is all functions
[2015-06-01 13:34:11] LocusAsaf: same thing twice with two different test styles as well
[2015-06-01 13:34:13] LocusAsaf: not sure if you saw that
[2015-06-01 13:35:51] dude-x: LocusAsaf: okay
[2015-06-01 13:36:03] dude-x: so one key point is that you shuld use classes for your page objects
[2015-06-01 13:36:10] dude-x: however the test themselves are best ran as functions
[2015-06-01 13:36:16] LocusAsaf: dude-x: yeah, I made an example of classes for page objects
[2015-06-01 13:36:26] LocusAsaf: last two files in the gist
[2015-06-01 13:36:40] dude-x: but page objects are always classes because you’re maintaing state in the page object (locators, and so on)
[2015-06-01 13:36:56] LocusAsaf: I'm actually totally on the fence between the two styles though although it's my understanding that everyone here favors classes
[2015-06-01 13:37:16] LocusAsaf: IMHO though, both ways are just as OO
[2015-06-01 13:37:34] dude-x: the test themselves should just be functions
[2015-06-01 13:37:46] LocusAsaf: you mean composed of functions?
[2015-06-01 13:37:52] dude-x: because py.test works better that way; unittest uses classes but it’s a copy of Java
[2015-06-01 13:37:54] LocusAsaf: oh yes I see what you mean
[2015-06-01 13:37:59] dude-x: and Java stuff doesn’t always apply
[2015-06-01 13:38:10] LocusAsaf: the tests themselves should not be imbedded in classes
[2015-06-01 13:38:12] LocusAsaf: I totally agree with that
[2015-06-01 13:38:39] LocusAsaf: the way I see it there's a very straight forward tradeoff of classes vs. pure functions
[2015-06-01 13:40:04] LocusAsaf: classes - you don't see the word driver on every line

[2015-06-01 13:51:46] dude-x: it will work but as more tests run, IE will run into memory leaks
[2015-06-01 13:51:53] dude-x: and then the driver crashes
[2015-06-01 13:52:04] dude-x: so it would have to be a function scope fixture

[2015-06-01 13:53:11] dude-x: LocusAsaf: you can save a little boilerplate with page objects with a BasePage object

[2015-06-01 13:53:16] dude-x: have all page objects inherit that
[2015-06-01 13:53:23] dude-x: so you don’t have to do an __init__
[2015-06-01 13:53:34] LocusAsaf: dude-x: but yeah thanks for confirming

[2015-06-01 14:16:11] dude-x: well i dont’ know i have to play with it
[2015-06-01 14:16:19] dude-x: but i havne’t had the incliniation to do so
[2015-06-01 14:16:42] LocusAsaf: @fixture(scope='session', params=[list of drivers])
[2015-06-01 14:16:46] LocusAsaf: as such
[2015-06-01 14:16:53] LocusAsaf: I have mine so I pass in a list of driver classes
[2015-06-01 14:16:59] LocusAsaf: like so
[2015-06-01 14:17:21] LocusAsaf: params=[Webdriver.firefox, Webdriver.chrome] and in the function do, return request.param()
[2015-06-01 14:17:53] Padawan: LocusAsaf: is it python, right?
[2015-06-01 14:19:55] LocusAsaf: yeah padawan
[2015-06-01 14:20:06] dude-x: LocusAsaf: if you’re using sauce, make it a function fixture
[2015-06-01 14:20:17] LocusAsaf: dude-x: because of IE?
[2015-06-01 14:20:28] LocusAsaf: or because there is no notion of session in sauce?>
[2015-06-01 14:20:36] dude-x: no so that each test is recorded indvidually in sauce
[2015-06-01 14:20:49] dude-x: otherwise 10 tests will be recorded as 1 giant session
[2015-06-01 14:20:56] dude-x: 1 giant test
[2015-06-01 14:21:24] Padawan: LocusAsaf: I was wondering if you could teach me how to pass the browsers to my TestCase, cuz the only way i got to work was through environment variables.
[2015-06-01 14:22:33] LocusAsaf: Padawan, are you using py.test?
[2015-06-01 14:22:43] Selenium-Github: [13selenium] 15joshbruning opened pull request #596: RemoteLogs unit tests. (06master...06tests) 02http://git.io/vkDUg
[2015-06-01 14:22:54] Padawan: LocusAsaf: nope, i am using  unittest.
[2015-06-01 14:22:56] LocusAsaf: dude-x: ahh, thanks for the advice
[2015-06-01 14:23:31] LocusAsaf: Padawan: I'm a big proponent of py.test and if you use none of the feature of py.test it looks just like unittest
[2015-06-01 14:23:38] LocusAsaf: essentially
[2015-06-01 14:23:56] LocusAsaf: without having to imbed everything inside of a class

[2015-06-01 14:24:11] Padawan: LocusAsaf: okay, i did take a look but i could not get my fixture to work out passing a browser argument
[2015-06-01 14:24:12] LocusAsaf: anyway, there are things called fixtures in py.test that are basically setup/teardown features

[2015-06-01 14:24:27] LocusAsaf: okay so you're semi-aware
[2015-06-01 14:24:33] LocusAsaf: let me find an example online
[2015-06-01 14:24:42] Padawan: I kind of did try pytest
[2015-06-01 14:25:35] LocusAsaf: I adapted what I'm talking about from this blog post, which puts it rather succinctly https://blogs.gnome.org/danni/2012/11/15/combining-py-test-and-selenium-to-test-webapps/

[2015-06-01 14:26:02] LocusAsaf: I especially liked how she put the browser objects into a dictionary and used the keys as the params

[2015-06-01 14:26:40] Padawan: LocusAsaf: Do you know what is session in this regard?
[2015-06-01 14:26:44] yenaemj_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-01 14:26:58] LocusAsaf: session is the highest level of the test
[2015-06-01 14:27:08] LocusAsaf: basically when you execute "py.test" there is one session
[2015-06-01 14:27:15] LocusAsaf: so it happens once for the entire test suite
[2015-06-01 14:27:26] pte_petey: hello lords and ladies of #selenium
[2015-06-01 14:27:26] LocusAsaf: so basically in her example the browser opens only once
[2015-06-01 14:27:30] Padawan: Like a suite being runned
[2015-06-01 14:27:33] LocusAsaf: yes
[2015-06-01 14:27:48] LocusAsaf: then there is scope, module, class, function
[2015-06-01 14:27:52] LocusAsaf: in that order
[2015-06-01 14:27:57] Padawan: Thanks LocusAsaf
[2015-06-01 14:28:04] LocusAsaf: do the fixture once per file, once per class or once per function
[2015-06-01 14:28:22] Padawan: LocusAsaf: i kind of have a basetestcase
[2015-06-01 14:28:26] LocusAsaf: as dude-x has enlightened me with the session scoping is good for firefox & chrome but not for IE since IE has memory leaks?
[2015-06-01 14:29:08] Padawan: LocusAsaf: i think i want to get that param and store as a test variable. Since i dont use the same browser for my tests.

[2015-06-01 14:29:47] LocusAsaf: you mean you use different browsers for different tests?

[2015-06-01 14:30:44] Padawan: Yes, thats kind of a question as well. Can i pass a param to a fixture from command line?
[2015-06-01 14:30:56] LocusAsaf: yes you can
[2015-06-01 14:31:03] Padawan: I want jenkins to call my testsuite n times
[2015-06-01 14:31:09] Padawan: n fro n browsers
[2015-06-01 14:31:29] LocusAsaf: with pytest you can create your own command line arguments and access them in fixtures etc...
[2015-06-01 14:32:21] LocusAsaf: there is also this diddy for parametrizing from command line https://pytest.org/latest/parametrize.html#basic-pytest-generate-tests-example
[2015-06-01 14:32:21] Padawan: Gonna study it a little.
[2015-06-01 14:33:02] LocusAsaf: essentially letting you decide what the parameters to your tests or fixtures are from the command line
