[2015-06-16 03:14:06] fabrice31, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-06-16 03:15:13] Dave_B_: a python method that if you've got the containing ul would let you pick by value of the li elements
[2015-06-16 03:15:14] Dave_B_: https://gist.github.com/daveberg/edfcf941e3a64c4bbf58
[2015-06-16 03:15:35] max___: Surum, you should have no problems with it. All custom made controls are easy to handle with great selenium tools. As a test I did manipulations with controls from google - works like a charm.
[2015-06-16 03:15:35] Dave_B_: just a basic one but maybe give you some ideas
[2015-06-16 03:16:15] Surum: I bet that it's easy to handle when you know how to and I'm having my baby steps with everything
[2015-06-16 03:16:32] max___: Ok, let me suggest you a book?

[2015-06-16 07:14:50] Surum: not bad
[2015-06-16 07:15:55] dgempesaw: it can be hard to write reliable/not-flaky, easily-maintained tests that provide meaningful feedback.
[2015-06-16 07:16:13] WhereIsMySpoon: there is nothing particularly hard about selenium's api
[2015-06-16 07:16:13] dgempesaw: or, to put it another way, it's pretty easy to write flaky tests that are hard to maintain :P
[2015-06-16 07:16:35] WhereIsMySpoon: the hard part is getting the test quality to be excellent
[2015-06-16 07:17:03] WhereIsMySpoon: both in the writing and analysis of the tests and the execution of the implementation

[2015-06-16 07:48:47] Surum: there are 3 drop-downs and they all are custom made storing options in ul class
[2015-06-16 07:48:56] Surum: how do I take out the css selector for that
[2015-06-16 07:49:30] Surum: I tried:

[2015-06-16 07:49:35] sircapsalot: is there anything to uniquely identify them?
[2015-06-16 07:49:49] Surum: there are in unordered list
[2015-06-16 07:50:56] sircapsalot: simonstewart, can i pm ?
[2015-06-16 07:51:50] WhereIsMySpoon: <ul> is not a class
[2015-06-16 07:51:51] WhereIsMySpoon: its a tag
[2015-06-16 07:51:59] WhereIsMySpoon: like div, li
[2015-06-16 07:52:06] WhereIsMySpoon: class is a tag attribute
[2015-06-16 07:52:10] WhereIsMySpoon: <ul class="blah">
[2015-06-16 07:52:24] sircapsalot: i think he knows, he might have mistyped :)  his selector is just fine
[2015-06-16 07:52:34] Surum: I'm not a he
[2015-06-16 07:52:40] sircapsalot: s/he/she
[2015-06-16 07:52:41] WhereIsMySpoon: just making sure
[2015-06-16 07:52:53] Surum: that selector does not work

[2015-06-16 07:53:02] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-06-16 07:53:04] sircapsalot: ha
[2015-06-16 07:53:04] Surum: sorry if I get definitions wrong, everything is still confusing to me
[2015-06-16 07:53:52] sircapsalot: Surum that selector probably doesn't work because of a lack of specificity
[2015-06-16 07:54:03] Surum: hmmm, what could I add up there?
[2015-06-16 07:54:04] sircapsalot: there are probably more than 1 .pp-select > ul's
[2015-06-16 07:54:14] Surum: there are
[2015-06-16 07:54:21] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-16 07:54:31] WhereIsMySpoon: so u need a longer selector
[2015-06-16 07:54:32] sircapsalot: yea, so you need to narrow down your selector to select the one you want
[2015-06-16 07:54:33] WhereIsMySpoon: that is more specific
[2015-06-16 07:54:44] sircapsalot: if they are in an order, you could use :nth-child(n)
[2015-06-16 07:56:06] Surum: I have this thing that seems specific for that drop-down: [data-target='brand']
[2015-06-16 07:56:16] yenaemj, joining. (#selenium)

[2015-06-16 07:58:20] WhereIsMySpoon: then u have all the info about syntax u need
[2015-06-16 07:58:31] sircapsalot: then you'll learn advanced selector techniques and how to combine different selectors
[2015-06-16 07:58:35] WhereIsMySpoon: mhm
[2015-06-16 07:59:02] sircapsalot: considering you were using the ">" operator, tells me that you already have a decent grasp
[2015-06-16 07:59:21] sircapsalot: instead of the descendent selector (" ")

[2015-06-16 08:14:59] Dave_B_: BDD in general as far as I'm concerned gives no real value and just adds an extra layer to maintain
[2015-06-16 08:15:18] Dave_B_: no, your business analysts won't be able to write the tests themselves
[2015-06-16 08:15:37] Dave_B_: and page objects do better at handling common methods than step definitions
[2015-06-16 08:16:03] Dave_B_: but I've seen so many job ads that say they use it that for a recruitment perspective it's probably worth trying yourself

[2015-06-16 08:47:03] lukeis: or follow git commit message common practice?
[2015-06-16 08:47:33] davehunt: I thought I did :)
[2015-06-16 08:47:52] davehunt: Link to something (other than selenium's doc) that disagrees?
[2015-06-16 08:48:45] davehunt: multiline commit messages are a pain from the command line, esp when the commit message is pretty short anyway
[2015-06-16 08:49:34] jimevans: davehunt: i don't find multiline commit messages all that onerous in git.

[2015-06-16 12:03:38] LocusAsaf: Does anyone have an informed opinion they can share on selenium test suites taking a long time to run? Maybe point me to some articles
[2015-06-16 12:04:16] LocusAsaf: I've heard some people say that a selenium test suite taking a long time is a bad thing but on the other hand I've heard first hand from people that their test suites take a long time
[2015-06-16 12:04:46] marmotworks: It depends upon the size of your suite
[2015-06-16 12:05:02] marmotworks: you can try to minimize the amount of time you're waiting for things
[2015-06-16 12:05:03] LocusAsaf: In general, obviously you want your test suite to run as fast as possible I'm just thinking that if you want a test suite to go really fast you just have to pay for lots of resources to get that done
[2015-06-16 12:05:10] marmotworks: you can increase parallelism
[2015-06-16 12:05:22] lukeis: maximize your parallelization to reduce the timeâ€¦ also (here) we limit the amount of time a single test can take
[2015-06-16 12:05:29] LocusAsaf: either you're using a service like Sauce which is expensive or you spinning your own vms and thats also expensive
[2015-06-16 12:05:35] marmotworks: lukeis ++
[2015-06-16 12:06:02] lukeis: LocusAsaf: we do both here :)  (use Sauce and spin our own VMs)
[2015-06-16 12:06:16] LocusAsaf: lukeis: you maximize parallelism by doing both those things, is that what you mean?
[2015-06-16 12:06:38] marmotworks: cost balance I imagine
[2015-06-16 12:06:38] LocusAsaf: lukeis: also, if a test fails on time what action do you take on that?
[2015-06-16 12:06:41] lukeis: we can do better here about parallelizing tests...
[2015-06-16 12:06:59] lukeis: we create bugs for a test failures
[2015-06-16 12:07:15] lukeis: but have a custom tool that aggregates failures and matches similar failures
[2015-06-16 12:07:28] LocusAsaf: and then you re-run them until they run under a given amount of time?
[2015-06-16 12:07:34] LocusAsaf: what is your time threshold?
[2015-06-16 12:07:44] lukeis: depends on browser type :)
[2015-06-16 12:07:51] marmotworks: Does anyone have suggestions on making an assertion that a loading overlay was displayed?
[2015-06-16 12:07:56] LocusAsaf: so what is it for IE, is that your slowest browser?
[2015-06-16 12:08:06] lukeis: no, iOS is our slowest
[2015-06-16 12:08:11] LocusAsaf: right
[2015-06-16 12:08:16] LocusAsaf: and so what is the threshold for that?
[2015-06-16 12:08:30] lukeis: i think we bumped that all the way to 20 min
[2015-06-16 12:08:49] lukeis: because saucelabs can take up to 5 minutes just to boot! :)
[2015-06-16 12:09:12] lukeis: but most of the time it's in the range of 1-2 min to boot
[2015-06-16 12:09:38] lukeis: but for others our cap is between 5 and 10 min
[2015-06-16 12:09:44] LocusAsaf: but in general what is the most important part of a test suite, execution time, consistency (ie tests dont have false positives)
[2015-06-16 12:09:50] LocusAsaf: coverage
[2015-06-16 12:10:01] lukeis: consistency is crucialâ€¦ and we're still working on it
[2015-06-16 12:10:12] lukeis: developers get cranky when they have to deal with bugs and it's a non-issue
[2015-06-16 12:10:22] LocusAsaf: yeah I feel like that is most important especially since its tricky for front-end testing
[2015-06-16 12:10:23] lukeis: we do re-run failures

[2015-06-16 12:14:31] lukeis: yes, i would put that importance a bit higher
[2015-06-16 12:15:16] LocusAsaf: okay, does anyone have any other opinions? Also, any articles/blog posts that can be shared?
[2015-06-16 12:16:02] sircapsalot: retries is certainly an important thing to do.
[2015-06-16 12:17:04] sircapsalot: a test can fail for any number of reasons ranging from not enough resources on the SUT, a legitimate bug, downtime, or any intermittent issue.  I retry my tests a max of 5 times (only if they fail, of course)
[2015-06-16 12:23:58] LocusAsaf: sircapsalot: when a test fails do you investigate why it failed if it passes on run 5 for instance?
[2015-06-16 12:25:01] lukeis: we do hereâ€¦ we call it a "flapper", has a different context and lower priority than regular failuresâ€¦ but still gets addressed

[2015-06-16 12:52:31] pte_petey: i've googled and it's something to do with inheritence/test loaders and I don't think page objects should have runners right ?
[2015-06-16 12:58:28] AutomatedTester: no... no they should not
[2015-06-16 12:58:28] AutomatedTester: a page object is a design pattern
[2015-06-16 12:58:28] AutomatedTester: has 0 to do with tests

[2015-06-16 13:25:13] AutomatedTester: UploadRegion has no runTest
[2015-06-16 13:25:16] pte_petey: somehow it's not inheriting all of the objects that should be part of the namespace ?
[2015-06-16 13:26:03] pte_petey: or that's how I read it
[2015-06-16 13:26:57] AutomatedTester: something is calling runTest on your page object
[2015-06-16 13:27:14] AutomatedTester: so I am guessing your test has something like class MyTests(UploadRegion)

[2015-06-16 13:33:45] pte_petey: the page base doesn't extend TestCase in the book
