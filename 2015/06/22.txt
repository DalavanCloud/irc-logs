[2015-06-22 04:49:59] masklinn: Is it possible to use selenium scripts for tours? E.g. a mode where selenium doesn’t control the browser but displays instructions and steps forward (displaying the next instruction) when a living user applies them?
[2015-06-22 04:50:23] sircapsalot, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-22 04:50:56] sohlemac_: Sounds more like a job for some custom injected javascript. Have you considered Greasemonkey?
[2015-06-22 04:57:52] masklinn: sohlemac_: it could be, basically we’re trying to use the same system for tours and functional tests so we can run the tours and mechanically ensure they work. Except right now we’ve basically grown a half-baked selenium-ish system from bootstrap-tour or something like that, I was wondering if doing it the other way around and not reinventing the wheel would be an option
[2015-06-22 05:01:09] sohlemac_: It could be possible. I don't see why you could just pass a css finder for the elemnt to a custom JS library that will draw a box around it.
[2015-06-22 05:02:02] sohlemac_: essentially, find the element you want to click (or have the user click, draw your tour information, click (or wait for the user to click), repeat.
[2015-06-22 05:04:17] sohlemac_: Again, you're going to be relying on some external JS for the tour part.
