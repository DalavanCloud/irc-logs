[2015-06-15 03:23:22] Dave_B_: otherwise I'd have thought you're basically looking for loopholes in your browsers security and that'll be an ongoing struggle - as browsers shouldn't be able to touch cookies in other domains. Could be that certain browsers are happy to allow this thruogh however their driver implementation works, but in general I'd not go near it with a bargepole
[2015-06-15 03:24:43] Dave_B_: eh, browser shouldn't allow sites to touch cookies of other domains even

[2015-06-15 04:03:20] jason12459: I am using webdriver with Java.  Is there any drawback in calling an explicit wait every time (building it into our framework)?
[2015-06-15 04:03:35] WhereIsMySpoon: jason12459: every time you what
[2015-06-15 04:05:54] jason12459: Building it into the framework so every time i do anything with an object it has an explict wiat
[2015-06-15 04:06:22] Dave_B_: wait for what?
[2015-06-15 04:06:51] Dave_B_: explicit waits are great cause they explicitly wait for the condition you need - but if you try to globally use one explicit wait then what condition is that?
[2015-06-15 04:07:12] jason12459: objects to appear
[2015-06-15 04:07:17] jason12459: blah.exists()
[2015-06-15 04:08:42] Dave_B_: do you use find_elements ever?
[2015-06-15 04:08:48] Dave_B_: ort always singular element
[2015-06-15 04:09:12] fabrice31, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-06-15 04:09:15] jason12459: yes sometimes we use find_elements
[2015-06-15 04:09:31] Dave_B_: so what would you be explicitly waiting for here?

[2015-06-15 04:09:51] CodeItClean, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-15 04:09:57] jason12459: either the object to exist or for it to timeout
[2015-06-15 04:09:57] Dave_B_: (not saying you can't do this, just trying to think of areas where it'll be confusing)
[2015-06-15 04:10:57] jason12459: setting this globally is alot less work than adding this every time for every object....I am just trying to figure out if there is a downside to using it so much, or for putting a higher time then needed
[2015-06-15 04:11:04] Dave_B_: find_elements will return you an object every time, it just might not have any webelements in it
[2015-06-15 04:11:10] neeti, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2015-06-15 04:11:49] Dave_B_: so I suspect the biggest downside would be needing to have the highest potential timeout which will mean when stuff is legitimately failing it'll be quite slow
[2015-06-15 04:12:02] Dave_B_: or any negative tests could become a bit weird
[2015-06-15 04:12:24] WhereIsMySpoon: well for example i have methods like waitTenForClickableThenClick(By locator)
[2015-06-15 04:12:32] WhereIsMySpoon: or waitClickableThenClick(By locator, int timeout)
[2015-06-15 04:12:45] WhereIsMySpoon: which does explicit wait for element is clickable then clicks it
[2015-06-15 04:13:19] WhereIsMySpoon: 10 secs is kinda normal so i got that as a convenience
[2015-06-15 04:13:22] Dave_B_: waiting for these conditions ^ would still be necessary with a global 'element exists' wait
[2015-06-15 04:13:45] jason12459: ok
[2015-06-15 04:14:07] max___, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-06-15 04:14:10] WhereIsMySpoon: if u find ur doing a explicit wait a lot then wrap it into a method like i did
[2015-06-15 04:15:00] Rollup, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-15 04:15:11] WhereIsMySpoon: i have other ones like waitSendText(By locator, String text, int timeout) which waits for element to be visible then does sendKeys
[2015-06-15 04:15:17] WhereIsMySpoon: and so on
[2015-06-15 04:15:56] jason12459: ok ... but other than it takeing longer to fail, or wierd negative tests, there is not a down side to calling an explicit wait every time i go to do something in my framework (and set the time globally)
[2015-06-15 04:17:17] WhereIsMySpoon: not particularly
[2015-06-15 04:17:58] Dave_B_: aye, you can have it if you like

[2015-06-15 07:43:07] Surum: I want to select a drop-down and store its values, I had no problems before, but now cannot find out how to actually select that element (there is no id or concrete class name (it's not the only class))
[2015-06-15 07:43:34] Surum: <select data-target="brand" style="display: none;">
[2015-06-15 07:43:47] Surum: I think I should take this somehow, but still dunno how to take that data out
[2015-06-15 07:44:41] marmotworks: Could you locate the element via relative xpath?
[2015-06-15 07:45:08] marmotworks: Like, is there a parent element that has an ID or something that you can locate against?
[2015-06-15 07:45:34] Surum: I'm trying that, but there is no id at all
[2015-06-15 07:45:54] Surum: there is only this generic parent class which even changes its name accordingly to actions in drop-down
[2015-06-15 07:46:01] marmotworks: are there other select fields on the page?
[2015-06-15 07:46:47] Surum: yep
[2015-06-15 07:46:52] Surum: there are three drop-downs
[2015-06-15 07:47:06] Surum: each of them differ only with data-target and its options
[2015-06-15 07:47:28] marmotworks: sooooo, I have some things you could try that are likely terrible?
[2015-06-15 07:47:48] bitgeeky, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-15 07:47:50] marmotworks: Because I don't know how how repeatable it is
[2015-06-15 07:48:02] Surum: go ahead, I already tried many terrible things
[2015-06-15 07:48:29] Surum: maybe it's too little information, I'll copy a bit more of web content to private for you
[2015-06-15 07:48:38] marmotworks: but you could findElements(By.TagName("select"))
[2015-06-15 07:49:07] Surum: I need to store all that dropdown
[2015-06-15 07:49:32] Surum: Select dropdown = new Select(driver.findElement(By.xpath("//lalalala")));
[2015-06-15 07:49:45] Surum: I am using this and just need that Element link somehow
[2015-06-15 07:49:47] marmotworks: here's my idea:
[2015-06-15 07:49:47] Surum: cannot find it out
[2015-06-15 07:51:13] marmotworks: List<WebElement> selectList = driver.findElements(By.TagName("select"))
[2015-06-15 07:51:47] marmotworks: then you can do
[2015-06-15 07:52:06] marmotworks: WebElement selectElement = selectList.get(1);
[2015-06-15 07:52:19] marmotworks: or whatever position that particular dropdown was in in the list
[2015-06-15 07:52:34] marmotworks: or selectList[1]
[2015-06-15 07:52:35] Surum: hmm
[2015-06-15 07:52:37] marmotworks: it's duper easrly
[2015-06-15 07:53:13] marmotworks: *super early
[2015-06-15 07:53:39] marmotworks: so, the fragility of that is that I don't know if selenium will find the select lists in the same order each time
[2015-06-15 07:53:49] marmotworks: that's the terrible thing aspect of the solution
[2015-06-15 07:54:08] Surum: pretty terrible as here order very much matters
[2015-06-15 07:55:10] Surum: the worst part that on the internet googling most examples have pretty basic contents with id and normal class names
[2015-06-15 07:55:26] Surum: and my devs are too advanced

[2015-06-15 08:00:07] marmotworks: like I said
[2015-06-15 08:00:10] marmotworks: try it
[2015-06-15 08:00:15] marmotworks: and see if what it returns is consistant
[2015-06-15 08:00:31] marmotworks: because maybe that'll be reliable, I just can't say for sure.

[2015-06-15 08:02:12] marmotworks: best solution: buy dev a donut and get him to stick an ID to the select list

[2015-06-15 08:02:35] Surum: ahaha
[2015-06-15 08:02:56] Surum: well, the problem is that I'm not automating an old version of our product
[2015-06-15 08:03:10] Surum: new one has way better selectors
[2015-06-15 08:03:24] Surum: but I need to check that site with older one
[2015-06-15 08:03:26] Surum: so stuck
[2015-06-15 08:04:01] marmotworks: hmmm.
[2015-06-15 08:04:16] marmotworks: i mean
[2015-06-15 08:04:29] marmotworks: I don't know if you can create a selector from Actions...
[2015-06-15 08:04:38] marmotworks: ala moving the mouse or something to coordinates

[2015-06-15 09:50:57] smccarthy: Is this years SeoConf expected to be streamed? I think it was in the past, and I won't be able to make it in person this year.
[2015-06-15 09:52:24] msi: jimevans: both implicit and explicit wait check for the element, wait x amount of time, and do one last check if it's present. With the fluent wait, it continuously checks for the element for x amount of time
[2015-06-15 09:54:22] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-15 09:54:37] Dave_B_: explicit waits poll for the element
[2015-06-15 09:54:42] octomeow: msi, described method does the same
[2015-06-15 09:54:53] jimevans: msi: i'm still not sure i understand. how exactly does the DefaultWait<T> class of the .NET bindings not do what you're asking?
[2015-06-15 09:55:11] octomeow: msi, just look at the link above : http://grokbase.com/t/gg/webdriver/132emw0yn6/fluentwait-equivalent-in-c
[2015-06-15 09:56:09] Dave_B_: look at the top comment, by jim evans (hint, same guy you're talknig to)

[2015-06-15 09:57:25] jimevans: and there won't *be* a "fluent interface" version in C# as long as i can help it, because i hate fluent interfaces.
[2015-06-15 09:57:36] Matthi: If i want to start selenium server from a upstart script, do i have to do something special to make it work? At the moment, the server starts, but every browser launched does not work , and I believe its because they dont know their display
[2015-06-15 09:58:18] Matthi: but there is a display manager on that server - restarting the selenium server manually just a bit after startup actually fixes the whole problem

[2015-06-15 12:05:32] pte_petey: the target page is : http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload. Here's my code : https://gist.github.com/plgent/a598bc053e714d3ec18c . The error I get when I run it is : https://gist.github.com/c50e975005a570a03cdc
[2015-06-15 12:05:51] pte_petey: what element should i use to subimit a file to ?
[2015-06-15 12:07:37] jimevans: you should be sending the keystrokes to the <input type='file'> element. in other words, the one with the id attribute of "file-upload"
[2015-06-15 12:08:19] jimevans: also, you're using find_element*s*_by_id (emphasis mine)
[2015-06-15 12:08:29] jimevans: that returns you a list of elements, not a single element.
[2015-06-15 12:09:38] pte_petey: ah

[2015-06-15 12:25:21] pte_petey: other times tests launch immediately
[2015-06-15 12:25:29] pte_petey: is there any kind of optimization for this ? or good practice
