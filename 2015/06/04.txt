[2015-06-04 07:27:59] mekhami: using a page object structure, is it bad practice/backwards to put some of your driver information in the base page object? I am always going to be using the remote web driver, so ideally I'd like to DRY this out of the test code
[2015-06-04 07:28:24] WhereIsMySpoon: mekhami: like what? the remote url etc?
[2015-06-04 07:28:36] WhereIsMySpoon: mekhami: I have all the setup for a WebDriver object in a separate utility class
[2015-06-04 07:28:38] mekhami: WhereIsMySpoon: just the driver information at this point.

[2015-06-04 07:34:59] barancev: I bet it is sauce network issue
[2015-06-04 07:35:19] jimevans: also, it's firefox version-specific. the same set of tests, running firefox 37, do not show this behavior
[2015-06-04 07:35:44] barancev: different VM images
[2015-06-04 07:35:50] jimevans: cf. the link to the FF37 job above.

[2015-06-04 07:44:03] WhereIsMySpoon: no it doesnt
[2015-06-04 07:44:09] WhereIsMySpoon: that belongs to the test itself
[2015-06-04 07:44:18] WhereIsMySpoon: perhaps if you could superset the tests

[2015-06-04 07:44:28] mekhami: WhereIsMySpoon: That's what I was about to suggest, creating my own test class that can set the driver

[2015-06-04 07:44:35] WhereIsMySpoon: soo
[2015-06-04 07:44:59] mekhami: WhereIsMySpoon: yeah I just want to abstract it away since it never changes, why not

[2015-06-04 08:31:41] jimevans: also, we *do* have those drag-and-drop test failures that are unexplained too.

[2015-06-04 08:35:02] jimevans: and then we get the bad rap for releasing something "bad"

[2015-06-04 09:22:18] jimevans: swampdragons: that'd be me, yeah.
[2015-06-04 09:22:32] swampdragons: You were right, our firefox on windows isn't 38.0.5
[2015-06-04 09:22:34] swampdragons: it's 38.0.1
[2015-06-04 09:22:42] swampdragons: I'll fix that now
[2015-06-04 09:22:49] swampdragons: 38.0.5 is the preference?
[2015-06-04 09:23:08] jimevans: yeah, let's get the latest on there. though i'm not really sure that'll matter, according to AutomatedTester.
[2015-06-04 09:23:14] swampdragons: :-/
[2015-06-04 09:23:18] swampdragons: well, it's worth a try
[2015-06-04 09:23:30] swampdragons: FWIW I just kicked off the 38.0.1 session manually from inside one of our vms
[2015-06-04 09:23:40] swampdragons: it's really unresponsive even manually controlling it
[2015-06-04 09:24:16] swampdragons: Anyway I'll try to get this out this morning, and at least there'll be one less source of variation
[2015-06-04 09:24:32] jimevans: it's odd that only windows 7 seems to be affected.
[2015-06-04 09:24:58] swampdragons: oh, really?  So you didn't see the lag with ff38 when you were on XP?
[2015-06-04 09:25:13] barancev: XP and Win8 are OK
[2015-06-04 09:25:19] swampdragons: whoah.
[2015-06-04 09:25:20] barancev: only Win7 is affected
[2015-06-04 09:25:27] swampdragons: that's really interesting.
[2015-06-04 09:25:33] lukeis: jimevans: that doesn't bode well for us
[2015-06-04 09:26:02] jimevans: lukeis: locally, the problem doesn't seem to happen, according to barancev.
[2015-06-04 09:26:18] barancev: lukeis: why did you decide to move all jobs to Win7?
[2015-06-04 09:26:36] lukeis: only in a Virtualized Win7 environmentâ¦ like some certain company uses to run all their Firefox tests? ;)
[2015-06-04 09:26:59] lukeis: barancev: cause XP is old as hell and shouldn't be used
[2015-06-04 09:27:19] swampdragons: What makes it interesting is that all the browsers are on a shared disk between all the vms. I'd expect to see issues with all of them if it were the browser itself
[2015-06-04 09:27:39] barancev: why not Win8, and we'd not have this bad feeling before the release :)
[2015-06-04 09:28:07] lukeis: i don't mind trying win8â¦ feel free to update the jobs?
[2015-06-04 09:28:13] jimevans: just because we didn't know about it doesn't mean the problem didn't exist.
[2015-06-04 09:28:14] barancev: too late...
[2015-06-04 09:28:26] jimevans: and honestly, i'd rather know if there's *really* a problme first.
[2015-06-04 09:28:28] barancev: yes, we know already...

[2015-06-04 09:28:33] swampdragons: that's probably the fastest course of action.  I feel pretty comfortable saying the lag isn't you all

[2015-06-04 10:53:47] mekhami: https://gist.github.com/mekhami/2f13aeecdcf91f96ccdd so i'm trying to extend TestCase to dry up the setUp methods across the project. what I'm wondering is how I can inject the capability from the test class... if that makes any sense
[2015-06-04 10:54:03] mekhami: basically i want the test class to have the option of overriding the desired capability
