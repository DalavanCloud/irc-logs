[2015-06-26 09:03:51] jjbender: we bumped up selenium from..2.35 to 2.44 i believe and the corresponding jenkins plugins.  also using the python selenium driver.  but im not sure why the chrome browser declares the capabilities it does, or why its so strict on matching.  anyway, gonna keep digging on this but if anyone has suggestions on how to troubleshoot i’d appreciate it!

[2015-06-26 09:54:41] D3M0S: jjbender, you should be on 2.46, I'd recommend that
[2015-06-26 09:55:03] D3M0S: jjbender, also, chromdriver is run as a separate file on your system
[2015-06-26 09:55:24] D3M0S: jjbender, on windows you'll have it set in path, and on linux you'll have a binary

[2015-06-26 09:55:33] jjbender: D3M0S — thanks for the pointers!  i dug in and i guess we used to send jenkins.nodeName and jenkins.Label in the JSON capabilities
[2015-06-26 09:56:18] jjbender: possibily the capability matching became more strict between now and then.  anyway, i got the job to actually submit to the grid and run by removing those restrictions

[2015-06-26 10:01:58] mik3: auto_sam, so the KeyDown method in Actions only has 2 signatures, one for the Key object you want to press and then one that takes the element as well as the key
[2015-06-26 10:02:08] mik3: In Java there's the .chord method, but C# doesn't have this
[2015-06-26 10:02:21] mik3: so, would I just make two calls to KeyDown?
[2015-06-26 10:02:44] jleyba: mik3, Key.chord just does a string concat and appends Key.NULL to the end

[2015-06-26 11:24:21] D3M0S: beaconwriter, yeah, there's no way to do it form the @FindBy, you should probably do something like if(driver.findElements(By).size() > 0) if you want to attempt to locate the element without throwing an exception
[2015-06-26 11:25:25] D3M0S: beaconwriter, ofc you can use @FindBy and it should be lazily initialized
[2015-06-26 11:25:40] D3M0S: meaning it wont attempt to find that element when the PageFactory code is called
