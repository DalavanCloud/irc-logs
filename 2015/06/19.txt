[2015-06-19 05:03:09] WhereIsMySpoon: if you really need to test on the user end that the name is correct AND the file downloads, then you're better off just making a small test using a url/http checker
[2015-06-19 05:03:55] WhereIsMySpoon: and checking the http response is good, the content-type is whatever you need it to be (application/csv I assume) and that the content-disposition is something like "attachment; filename=myNameHere.csv"
[2015-06-19 05:04:13] WhereIsMySpoon: hopefully your application puts that info in the http resp

[2015-06-19 06:23:45] Dave_B_: sircapsalot is right, it's looking for 1 second every tenth of a second…
[2015-06-19 06:24:13] Dave_B_: but it's also got weird exception handling mixed in
[2015-06-19 06:24:25] PDL: Yeye
[2015-06-19 06:24:29] PDL: not right now
[2015-06-19 06:25:15] Dave_B_: that exception handling will mean after the first second has passed it times out then moves onto the second locator then starts the timer again

[2015-06-19 07:04:07] sircapsalot: well no, a <strong> is a block level element

[2015-06-19 07:12:50] sircapsalot: jeffg
[2015-06-19 07:13:05] jeffg: sircapsalot, specific meaning selects only one element? yes.
[2015-06-19 07:13:48] jeffg: sircapsalot, a few lines later i use the same selector to target a click(), which works as expected
[2015-06-19 07:16:40] Dave_B_: if you do just the a.sign-in-link part of the selector do you get any text?
[2015-06-19 07:18:20] jeffg: Dave_B_, negative. still the empty string.
[2015-06-19 07:18:21] sircapsalot: hrm.

[2015-06-19 07:26:19] WhereIsMySpoon: thats how comparators work
[2015-06-19 07:26:30] WhereIsMySpoon: wrap that in a comparator interface
[2015-06-19 07:26:34] WhereIsMySpoon: and send it to your compare method
[2015-06-19 07:26:36] sircapsalot: jeffg, if possible, you should :gist the entire html page (stripping any sensitive info of course)  so we can see your selector, and your page layout

[2015-06-19 07:32:52] dude-x: Dave_B_:  if the strings are consistent can i get away with comparing strings?

[2015-06-19 07:33:51] dude-x: alright. thanks for your ideas
[2015-06-19 07:34:07] WhereIsMySpoon: just convert them into actual date objects and use python's built in stuff to compare them
[2015-06-19 07:34:10] WhereIsMySpoon: im sure python has date comparison
[2015-06-19 07:34:20] WhereIsMySpoon: rather than building ur own and reinventing the wheel
[2015-06-19 07:34:20] dude-x: i was really looking for a naming convention

[2015-06-19 07:34:30] dude-x: i am not doing anything exotic
[2015-06-19 07:34:31] WhereIsMySpoon: in that case you dont want camelCase for a start
[2015-06-19 07:34:39] Dave_B_: datetime.strptime("19/06/2015", "%dd/%mm/%yy) or something
[2015-06-19 07:34:47] Dave_B_: I forget the exact options

[2015-06-19 07:35:45] WhereIsMySpoon: <_>
[2015-06-19 07:35:48] dude-x: the first thing i thought of was compare_dates(dataA, dateb) but then if i were to look at this code later, i would have to remember the order, what dose a 1, 0, -1 mean and so on.
