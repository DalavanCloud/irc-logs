[2015-06-03 07:11:20] simonstewart: It provided an implementation of JSON for ancient browsers without native support
[2015-06-03 07:11:36] simonstewart: If something claims it can't find it, then I'd start poking around there
[2015-06-03 07:11:48] barancev: FF38 is not ancient :)
[2015-06-03 07:12:37] simonstewart: Indeed it is not.

[2015-06-03 10:04:51] Rancho: how to solve this issue
[2015-06-03 10:05:05] lukeis: Rancho: use By.cssSelector instead of By.className
[2015-06-03 10:05:12] Rancho: ok
[2015-06-03 10:05:21] jimevans: Rancho: you tried to use a class name with a space. use css selectors instead.
[2015-06-03 10:05:22] lukeis: ".class1.class2"

[2015-06-03 10:07:11] jimevans: Rancho: no.
[2015-06-03 10:07:28] jimevans: you have an element that is like <div class="class1 class2">
[2015-06-03 10:07:29] davehunt, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2015-06-03 10:08:03] jimevans: to find that with a css selector for both values in the class attribute, you'd use ".class1.class2"

[2015-06-03 10:08:59] Rancho: i see
[2015-06-03 10:11:50] jimevans: barancev, titus__: we've still got an issue with the CI runs. i'm not going to release something that takes literally 6 times longer running on windows than it does on linux. if the issue is environmental on the part of saucelabs, let's (have the vendor) fix the environment. if it's something in the driver, we need to fix it there.
[2015-06-03 10:13:23] jimevans: it could be beyond our control, but i want proof of that.
[2015-06-03 10:13:52] jimevans: if people disagree, someone else can take the damned bacon. i didn't want it in the first place.
[2015-06-03 10:14:13] Rancho: jimevans This is my class  <div class = "conflicterror_msg">text</div>
[2015-06-03 10:14:35] Rancho: what is the second value here
[2015-06-03 10:14:56] jimevans: what was your code when you tried to use By.className?

[2015-06-03 10:15:49] jimevans: jleyba: one second.
[2015-06-03 10:16:13] jimevans: Rancho: if you're getting the "compound class" exception, there must be a space in your quotes somewhere.
[2015-06-03 10:16:50] Rancho: oh
[2015-06-03 10:16:51] jimevans: jleyba: we're seeing some failures in the javascript tests for firefox 38. it may be environmental, but you've spent more time there than anyone else, especially since some of the failures were around promises.
[2015-06-03 10:17:05] jleyba: :ci
[2015-06-03 10:17:39] Rancho: there is a space in website code as part of the class name
[2015-06-03 10:17:48] Rancho: should i remove that space?
[2015-06-03 10:18:20] jimevans: Rancho: if there's a space in the website code, then the element has multiple classes. that's the whole point i've been trying to make.
[2015-06-03 10:18:58] Rancho: ok well noted but then how do i get text from this class?
[2015-06-03 10:19:52] jimevans: Rancho: you don't get text from the "class", you get it from the element. you're using the class simply to find the element. once you can successfully do that using findElement, you call getText() on the resulting WebElement.
[2015-06-03 10:21:18] Auto1: is anyone oppose to using angular vs java+selenium ?
[2015-06-03 10:21:44] jimevans: Auto1: huh? that sounds like an apples-to-oranges comparison.
[2015-06-03 10:22:05] jleyba: jimevans, tests all pass for me on linux Firefox 38.0
[2015-06-03 10:22:19] jleyba: Might be a few hours before I have time to mess with a VM to check Windows
[2015-06-03 10:22:23] jimevans: jleyba: linux isn't the issue. they only fail on windows.
[2015-06-03 10:22:43] jimevans: i'm trying to track down possible environmental issues in the sauce-provided VMs.
[2015-06-03 10:22:55] Auto1: why? trying to figure out if it will make sense to change all our test to angular. since the application is base on javascript.
[2015-06-03 10:23:39] jimevans: Auto1: angular is an application development framework. selenium is a browser automation library. angular doesn't have anything to do with testing.
[2015-06-03 10:25:10] jimevans: angular *does* have a companion project called protractor that knows about angular-based applications, which is based on the webdriver javascript language bindings, but as far as i'm aware, it doesn't give you any advantages when used on non-angular applications.
[2015-06-03 10:26:18] jleyba: jimevans, ^ correct. protractor eases webdriver test writing for angular apps only
[2015-06-03 10:26:36] Auto1: yes I meant angular-protractor
[2015-06-03 10:26:56] jleyba: no reason to use protractor if your app doesn't use angular
[2015-06-03 10:28:29] Auto1: the app is hybrid, and 30% of is angular. I am being told protractor will be best for testing
[2015-06-03 10:28:41] jleyba: jimevans, So that "few hours" turned out to be "few minutes" :)
[2015-06-03 10:29:01] jleyba: It's a sauce problem. Tests pass for me on FF38 in Win7
[2015-06-03 10:29:32] jimevans: jleyba: yeah, me too. i need to figure this out.
[2015-06-03 10:30:13] jleyba: Does Firefox have flags to disable ES6 features? Wonder if some of those are flipped (just a hunch based on the failing generator tests)
[2015-06-03 10:30:50] jimevans: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[2015-06-03 10:41:47] jimevans: when we had regular, active participation from saucers in the channel, it made sense to use them. but getting ahold of someone to actually work with us on issues like what we're seeing now has become increasingly difficult.
[2015-06-03 10:42:11] sircapsalot: just debuted a couple hours ago dude-x
[2015-06-03 10:42:21] dude-x: what are other alternatives to sauce?
[2015-06-03 10:42:34] sircapsalot: a custom AWS solution
[2015-06-03 10:42:36] jleyba: browserstack
[2015-06-03 10:42:43] jimevans: dude-x: there are a few. browserstack jumps to mind.
[2015-06-03 10:43:01] jimevans: sircapsalot: oh dear $deity, please, no.
[2015-06-03 10:43:20] dude-x: yeah i’m aware of browser stack
[2015-06-03 10:43:32] jleyba: i think sauce and browserstack are the two major players in the Selenium space
[2015-06-03 10:44:22] jimevans: the last effing thing i want to do with my time is mess around with some custom stack of code that i'm going to have to maintain, that i won't have time to maintain, and that won't have as many eyes on it as a commercial platform.

[2015-06-03 10:45:27] sircapsalot: that's why you automate it all.  i've got mine customized to crap.. simple scripts to upgrade the AMI, choose the least expensive option, relaunch the grid with a custom amount of nodes, etc etc.
[2015-06-03 10:46:35] sircapsalot: it takes a LOT of time to have something remotely maintainable though…  that's one huge downside

[2015-06-03 10:49:45] jimevans: oh, i needed that after the kind of day i've been having.
[2015-06-03 10:50:11] sircapsalot: does anybody that use saucelabs have an enterprise license?
[2015-06-03 10:50:32] dude-x: i have medium team license 10 vms and 9000 minutes
[2015-06-03 10:51:01] jimevans: in my experience, projects like ours require maintainers who are passionate about maintaining whatever part of the system they're working on.
[2015-06-03 10:51:35] jimevans: i'm quite sure if i decided to not do any more work on the selenium project at all that the IE driver and the .NET bindings would go very much unchanged from this point forward.
[2015-06-03 10:51:54] sircapsalot: do you know how much that costs dude-x?  i'm curious how our setup compares to saucelabs.  in our initial sweep of looking at saucelabs, our soultion was less expensive at the time
[2015-06-03 10:51:55] jimevans: because nobody gives enough of a damn to keep up with them
[2015-06-03 10:52:26] dude-x: sircapsalot: i think we pay 760 per month
[2015-06-03 10:52:34] dude-x: i know it’s in the 700's
[2015-06-03 10:52:45] gabecase: maybe we can get some new contributers for those drivers jimevans
[2015-06-03 10:53:07] jimevans: gabecase: i've been open to collaborating with people for years. hasn't happened yet.
[2015-06-03 10:53:22] sircapsalot: ok yea - my approximation for how much we spend, is 300/m for 30 concurrent tests at a time, for 4000 hours
[2015-06-03 10:53:23] dude-x: sircapsalot: i’ve read that in general, an enterprise license is about 200 dollars per vm
[2015-06-03 10:53:35] gabecase: I did IE and C# dev for years and just came onto the automation scene fairly recently
[2015-06-03 10:53:50] gabecase: I would hope I can get some more people as well
[2015-06-03 10:53:56] dude-x: sircapsalot: diffreent browsers?
[2015-06-03 10:53:59] sircapsalot: because we have 30 nodes for 0.018c/h
[2015-06-03 10:54:00] sircapsalot: yes
[2015-06-03 10:54:07] dude-x: including IE?
[2015-06-03 10:54:21] dude-x: (though where I work i don’t need to test IE)
[2015-06-03 10:54:21] sircapsalot: including ie, yea these are Windows Server 2000 machines
[2015-06-03 10:54:31] gabecase: I know some quite a few teams that use .NET bindings etc... some do open source work as well but I guess web driver doesn't seem as 'sexy' a project to work on :\
[2015-06-03 10:54:44] jimevans: gabecase: i'm not saying i'm ready to give up maintaining those pieces yet, i'm just saying i find it highly unlikely anyone would be willing to actually take over maintenance, given my experience over the last five years.
[2015-06-03 10:55:00] jimevans: honestly, the .NET bindings are pretty darned stable.
[2015-06-03 10:55:07] dude-x: sircapsalot: in the future when my automation is better, i may want to become a hero and switch from sauce to a setup like yours. :)
[2015-06-03 10:55:25] sircapsalot: gotta get through jimevans first.. he's not for it ;)
[2015-06-03 10:55:26] dude-x: sircapsalot: sauce provides videos, do you record videos?
[2015-06-03 10:55:49] jleyba: jimevans, safaridriver still needs an owner :(
[2015-06-03 10:55:53] gabecase: IE driver overall for large scale automation is a huge source of pain no lie, we had to do tons of monkey patching etc... only did it because we had to
[2015-06-03 10:56:04] sircapsalot: no. haha.  i never found the use for that, but that's just me :)  logs are plenty enough for our testers
[2015-06-03 10:56:09] jimevans: sircapsalot: i'm for it, if someone is willing to, in perpetuity, be able to maintain it.
[2015-06-03 10:56:11] gabecase: I can see why people shy away from using/contributing to it sometimes
[2015-06-03 10:56:15] sircapsalot: definitely

[2015-06-03 10:57:38] jimevans: yep. the MSFT IE driver implementation is DOA right now.
[2015-06-03 10:57:52] jimevans: all work and attention has been turned to Edge.
[2015-06-03 10:58:01] jimevans: internally, at least.

[2015-06-03 10:58:46] jimevans: and they're committed to providing a webdriver implementation for Edge.
[2015-06-03 10:58:47] gabecase: jimevans no lie that community not contributing back there issues is part of the problem, alot of it was consulting work which was 'billable hours', companies forcing you to do only client work with little to no afterthought on tooling
[2015-06-03 10:58:57] jimevans: just no timeline for providing it.
[2015-06-03 10:59:13] gabecase: +1 edge
[2015-06-03 10:59:23] gabecase: Microsoft gets shit right... eventually
[2015-06-03 10:59:29] gabecase: saw they announced ssh support?
[2015-06-03 10:59:50] jimevans: gabecase: that's not an "ability" excuse, that's a "willingness" excuse. as in, "i'm not willing to contribute"
[2015-06-03 11:00:17] jimevans: and thus when complaints are made about the quality of the IE driver, i roll my eyes.
[2015-06-03 11:00:27] gabecase: yeah im with you
[2015-06-03 11:00:41] gabecase: I starte dout there and now use the ruby bindings full time with FF

[2015-06-03 11:01:18] jimevans: people who bitch and moan about how crappy the IE driver code is (and it's pretty crappy, i'll admit), but then aren't willing to do thing one about improving it.

[2015-06-03 11:03:58] jimevans: the biggest barriers to entry for most people with the IE driver are that first, it's implemented in c++; and second, until the release of the "community edition" sku of visual studio, you needed a paid-for version of visual studio to work on it.
[2015-06-03 11:04:52] jimevans: not that c++ is that bad, but it's scary to most people who are used to garbage-collected languages.

[2015-06-03 11:07:48] jimevans: gabecase: yes, because at the time it was written, there was no guarantee you'd have a .NET runtime on the target OS, and asking that as a requirement for people not using .NET languages was, in my opinion, rude.
[2015-06-03 11:09:04] jimevans: especially since the initial implementation required native API access (p/invoke in .NET, jna in java, ctypes in python, ffi in ruby)
[2015-06-03 11:09:25] jimevans: and you couldn't easily get exported function names from a .NET dll.
[2015-06-03 11:09:32] jimevans: still can't, afaik

[2015-06-03 11:10:36] jimevans: it'd be easier to sell a .NET-dependent version written in c# now that most browser-specific implementations use the json wire protocol over http.
[2015-06-03 11:10:55] jimevans: but 5 years ago, that wasn't the case.
[2015-06-03 11:13:32] ato: lukeis: Probably not, but I don't always bother or remember asking.
[2015-06-03 11:14:09] lukeis: yeah, there's a couple of other instances in the git log… it comes from users using the github UI to edit files there (and them having their email set to private)
[2015-06-03 11:14:32] ato: Ah.
[2015-06-03 11:16:15] Rancho: <jimevans I have got two numbers from getText() , can i use simple if(tex1>tex) to print an output?

[2015-06-03 11:19:36] jimevans: Rancho: you *could*, but it'd be incorrect to do so. :)
[2015-06-03 11:19:52] ctgriffiths, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-06-03 11:20:08] jimevans: because "10" is less than "2" when you're talking about strings, which is what getText() returns. :)
[2015-06-03 11:20:53] jimevans: i'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to discover how to turn a string containing a numeric value into an actual numeric data type in java.
[2015-06-03 11:21:18] jleyba: Integer.parseInt("10", 10)
[2015-06-03 11:21:34] jleyba: (always specify the radix when parsing numbers)
[2015-06-03 11:21:43] jimevans: aww, c'mon jleyba, teach a person to fish, don't give 'em a fish.
[2015-06-03 11:21:44] jimevans: :)
[2015-06-03 11:22:48] jimevans: of course, as i said on twitter the other day, most people don't want to be taught, the just want someone to "give me teh codez"
[2015-06-03 11:23:05] lukeis: i don't know if it actually works that way jimevans… from my experience it seems they keep coming back trying to learn how to catch different fish ;)
[2015-06-03 11:23:42] jimevans: if they're truly different fish, that's no problem! :)
[2015-06-03 11:24:12] lukeis: sometimes I need a break from mentoring ;)
[2015-06-03 11:24:28] jimevans: me too.
[2015-06-03 11:27:12] barancev: oh, new HtmlUnit
[2015-06-03 11:27:27] jleyba: still fake rendering engine, still fake js engine, still not worth using
[2015-06-03 11:27:28] jimevans: go ahead and merge it, if you want.
[2015-06-03 11:28:03] jimevans: it's pretty clear i'm not going to get a release out today.

[2015-06-03 11:29:26] jleyba: barancev, https://github.com/MachinePublishers/jBrowserDriver looks interesting
[2015-06-03 11:29:40] jleyba: except for the whole GPL thing
[2015-06-03 11:32:11] jimevans: jleyba: well, that, and webkit.

[2015-06-03 11:35:35] jleyba: lukeis, not sure how they reconcile that with GPL - that alone would stop me from recommending it. just saying it looked interesting as a headless java browser option
[2015-06-03 11:37:17] lukeis:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ phantomjs works well enough for me ;)
[2015-06-03 11:37:30] barancev: jleyba: we expected HtmlUnitDriver to be moved to HtmlUnit
[2015-06-03 11:37:42] lukeis: we did?
[2015-06-03 11:37:49] barancev: yes, even they made a copy of the source
[2015-06-03 11:38:08] barancev: but there is no more acivity in this direction
[2015-06-03 11:38:16] jleyba: barancev, don't think we ever expected that. Simon was against pushing the source out
