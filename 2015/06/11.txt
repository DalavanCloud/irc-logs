[2015-06-11 02:34:48] chachan: hey guys. I'm having a boring problem. An element, which is clickable and visible doesn't respond to click method. I try debugging the test and do the click by myself and it works. I checked the object to make sure I'm selecting the right one and it is the right one, what other possible causes could it be?
[2015-06-11 02:35:08] chachan: and no JavaScript errors
[2015-06-11 02:35:27] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: whats the selenium error you get, whats the selenium code and whats the html? please paste into a :gist
[2015-06-11 02:36:09] aj4u: anyway to reset a datepicker in selenium ?
[2015-06-11 02:36:23] aj4u: I tried datepicker.clear() / datepicker.send_keys('')
[2015-06-11 02:36:41] aj4u: but it throws an exception about not being editable
[2015-06-11 02:40:02] WhereIsMySpoon: aj4u: you'll have to use executeScript with the JavascriptExecutor to clear it

[2015-06-11 02:44:20] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: that error is related with an element that is suppose to be visible after clicking on "distribution-tab"
[2015-06-11 02:44:48] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: no error related with "distribution-tab" which is the weird part :/
[2015-06-11 02:45:02] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: selenium code?
[2015-06-11 02:45:11] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: hold on
[2015-06-11 02:47:55] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: https://bitbucket.org/snippets/mobydev/G46n4 Hopefully I'm including all the important classes

[2015-06-11 02:53:37] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: as I thought, I think
[2015-06-11 02:53:45] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: so when u do this property_page.distribution_button.element.click(
[2015-06-11 02:53:47] WhereIsMySpoon: )
[2015-06-11 02:53:51] WhereIsMySpoon: this loads something right?
[2015-06-11 02:54:01] chachan: it should, but it doesn't
[2015-06-11 02:54:20] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: ur sure that it isnt loading it?
[2015-06-11 02:54:44] WhereIsMySpoon: cause to me it looks like u need a wait between that line and the next
[2015-06-11 02:54:56] aj4u: WhereIsMySpoon> left my desk
[2015-06-11 02:55:04] aj4u: thanks, I'll try that
[2015-06-11 02:55:10] WhereIsMySpoon: if 1 button should make something appear, then the next thing u wanna do is interact with that thing, u need a wait between these actions
[2015-06-11 02:55:24] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: yes, the HTML is there, is a tab switcher. If I debug and stop before and after that click, I can do the click without seeing any error or misbehavior
[2015-06-11 02:55:38] WhereIsMySpoon: else it will go "click on thing one click on thing 2" when thing 2 isnt there yet
[2015-06-11 02:55:48] WhereIsMySpoon: do u understand?
[2015-06-11 02:56:29] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: yes, but I should get an error when I try to do the click
[2015-06-11 02:56:54] chachan: and I also added an expected condition element_is_clickable, same
[2015-06-11 02:56:55] WhereIsMySpoon: you do
[2015-06-11 02:57:09] WhereIsMySpoon: traceback on property_page.buildings_list.element.click()
[2015-06-11 02:57:14] WhereIsMySpoon: Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with
[2015-06-11 02:58:01] WhereIsMySpoon: that happens because your test is expecting STRAIGHT away to be able to click on buildings list after the previous click
[2015-06-11 02:58:02] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: I'll add another condition to that one. Hold on a sec
[2015-06-11 02:58:14] WhereIsMySpoon: and by straight away I really mean exactly straight away, as fast as a pc can send commands
[2015-06-11 02:58:14] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: yeah, I see your point
[2015-06-11 02:58:27] WhereIsMySpoon: waits are important
[2015-06-11 03:23:09] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: what condition would you use?, I've tried with few without any luck
[2015-06-11 03:23:45] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: visibility
[2015-06-11 03:23:53] WhereIsMySpoon: or actually no
[2015-06-11 03:23:55] WhereIsMySpoon: clickable
[2015-06-11 03:24:00] WhereIsMySpoon: since u wanna click on it
[2015-06-11 03:24:03] WhereIsMySpoon: clickable implies visibility
[2015-06-11 03:24:35] WhereIsMySpoon: so u dont need to test visibility
[2015-06-11 03:24:55] barancev: clickable does NOT imply visibility
[2015-06-11 03:25:04] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: I tried both already
[2015-06-11 03:25:18] barancev: transparent element is clickable, but not visible
[2015-06-11 03:25:28] WhereIsMySpoon: oh really
[2015-06-11 03:25:38] WhereIsMySpoon: i thought selenium did a check for visibility during the clickable check
[2015-06-11 03:26:48] p_l: I believe it simulates what user might do
[2015-06-11 03:26:57] p_l: and it's perfectly easy to click a transparent element ;)
[2015-06-11 03:27:14] WhereIsMySpoon: sure
[2015-06-11 03:27:35] barancev: selenium does check. but there is an opinion that it is not right :)
[2015-06-11 03:27:41] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: so you tried putting an explicit wait after         property_page.distribution_button.element.click() ?
[2015-06-11 03:27:45] barancev: interactable != displayed
[2015-06-11 03:27:46] chachan: I get "Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with"
[2015-06-11 03:27:52] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: thats what I meant
[2015-06-11 03:28:47] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: I meant to the selenium impl, clickable implies visible as it does a check in the background
[2015-06-11 03:28:48] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: I tried with: self.buildings_list = PageElement(self.driver, (By.ID, 'buildings-list'), ec.element_to_be_clickable)
[2015-06-11 03:29:21] WhereIsMySpoon: i have no idea what that is
[2015-06-11 03:29:24] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont code in python =/
[2015-06-11 03:29:42] WhereIsMySpoon: http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/waits.html
[2015-06-11 03:29:46] WhereIsMySpoon: this is an explicit wait in python
[2015-06-11 03:29:57] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: I'm just telling him to wait until element can be clickable
[2015-06-11 03:30:03] WhereIsMySpoon: you want visibility of
[2015-06-11 03:30:09] WhereIsMySpoon: try the way it does in this page
[2015-06-11 03:30:17] WhereIsMySpoon: ive never seen this pageelement thing
[2015-06-11 03:30:50] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: yeah, I do that in a higher class
[2015-06-11 03:31:09] chachan: check the last class here: https://bitbucket.org/snippets/mobydev/G46n4
[2015-06-11 03:31:32] chachan: line 86 and 100
[2015-06-11 03:31:43] chachan: and 102 heh
[2015-06-11 03:32:33] chachan: let me increase that time just test
[2015-06-11 03:32:41] chachan: for test *

[2015-06-11 03:35:10] WhereIsMySpoon: in init
[2015-06-11 03:35:13] WhereIsMySpoon: you have this         self.distribution_button = PageElement(self.driver, (By.ID, 'distribution-tab'), ec.element_to_be_clickable)
[2015-06-11 03:35:15] chachan: I tested it with 10, makes no sense, that HTML is there. If I click it, it switches it immediately
[2015-06-11 03:35:21] WhereIsMySpoon: not that
[2015-06-11 03:35:31] WhereIsMySpoon: self.buildings_list = PageElement(self.driver, (By.ID, 'buildings-list'))
[2015-06-11 03:35:55] WhereIsMySpoon: and u now changed that to PageElement(self.driver, (By.ID, 'buildings-list'), ec.element_to_be_clickable)
[2015-06-11 03:36:01] WhereIsMySpoon: right?
[2015-06-11 03:36:14] simonstewart: Bastard things that only use one core on a multi-core machine. Bah
[2015-06-11 03:36:23] chachan: yes, let me update the code
[2015-06-11 03:36:54] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: ok so in your init, you go, "get me this element" but this element only appears after uve clicked distribution list..
[2015-06-11 03:37:02] WhereIsMySpoon: can u pls try adding a webdriverwait in the actual test code
[2015-06-11 03:37:11] WhereIsMySpoon: after this         property_page.distribution_button.element.click()
[2015-06-11 03:37:34] chachan: and implicit wait?
[2015-06-11 03:37:36] chachan: an*
[2015-06-11 03:38:05] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: like this: driver.implicitly_wait(10) ?

[2015-06-11 03:38:17] WhereIsMySpoon: not presence

[2015-06-11 03:38:19] WhereIsMySpoon: visibility of
[2015-06-11 03:38:24] WhereIsMySpoon: never use implicit waits

[2015-06-11 08:56:38] D3M0S: okay, so what I'd do is just driver.get("http://example.com/forbidden");
[2015-06-11 08:56:49] D3M0S: then LoginPage loginPage = new LoginPage();
[2015-06-11 08:56:55] LocusAsaf: okay cool
[2015-06-11 08:57:04] LocusAsaf: thats exactly what I'm doing
[2015-06-11 08:57:05] D3M0S: and assertTrue(loginPage.isLoginPage());

[2015-06-11 08:59:24] LocusAsaf: sure...?
[2015-06-11 08:59:25] D3M0S: that you don't have some provision in your LoginPage constructor that does driver.get("http://www.example.com/login")
[2015-06-11 08:59:32] LocusAsaf: right
[2015-06-11 08:59:40] D3M0S: because that would invalidate it
[2015-06-11 09:01:03] D3M0S: and on that note, you might want to look into my blog post where I detail some possible ways to do both
[2015-06-11 09:01:11] LocusAsaf: do both what?
[2015-06-11 09:01:16] LocusAsaf: and yes sure please link
[2015-06-11 09:01:55] D3M0S: http://automationsdet.blogspot.com/2014/09/selenium-2-webdriver-part-2-page-object.html
[2015-06-11 09:02:02] D3M0S: Page Initialization
[2015-06-11 09:02:07] D3M0S: right at the top of part 2
[2015-06-11 09:02:50] D3M0S: so here we're talking about the Assume Page Loaded case
[2015-06-11 09:05:15] D3M0S: basically I noticed a lot of people will put the driver.get function in page object constructors
[2015-06-11 09:05:26] D3M0S: which would invalidate any links being clicked
[2015-06-11 09:05:49] D3M0S: so this is a way I allowed users to specify how they want to arrive at that page in the browser using the page object as the initializer

[2015-06-11 09:06:13] WhereIsMySpoon: D3M0S: driver.get in PO constructors? O.o
[2015-06-11 09:06:17] gabel, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-11 09:06:17] WhereIsMySpoon: that seems rather silly
[2015-06-11 09:06:26] N3sh108: I am trying to use selenium for fetching the content of a page in Android. I went to selendroid but I couldn't find the library itself (only the standalone)
[2015-06-11 09:06:31] N3sh108: where can I find it?
[2015-06-11 09:06:32] D3M0S: WhereIsMySpoon, there are valid cases to do so
[2015-06-11 09:07:36] D3M0S: WhereIsMySpoon, but you need to guard against it being called when not wanted also
[2015-06-11 09:08:06] WhereIsMySpoon: ive never had a scenario where i thought that would be useful
[2015-06-11 09:08:15] WhereIsMySpoon: but then again the websites i work with are heavily based on js
[2015-06-11 09:08:17] D3M0S: there's a difference in arriving at that page via URL bar and arriving at it via link....if you always call driver.get in the constructor you invalide any tests on that link.
[2015-06-11 09:09:14] WhereIsMySpoon: for sure
[2015-06-11 09:09:40] D3M0S: WhereIsMySpoon, basically at overstock, we had a TON of products, and it was chewing up loads of test time navigating to them
[2015-06-11 09:09:54] D3M0S: so we made it so you can navigate directly to the product page at the beginning of the test
[2015-06-11 09:10:05] D3M0S: with just a product number
[2015-06-11 09:11:01] WhereIsMySpoon: i see

[2015-06-11 09:51:53] D3M0S: selenium early bird tickets are on sale
[2015-06-11 09:53:26] shawnknight: D3M0S - what are your other 2 top priorities
[2015-06-11 09:53:31] merobertsjr__, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-11 09:54:00] WhereIsMySpoon: reliability and performance for me
[2015-06-11 09:54:19] D3M0S: shawnknight, maintainability and extensibility
[2015-06-11 09:54:37] WhereIsMySpoon: eh hm
[2015-06-11 09:54:38] D3M0S: reliability might be tied with extensibility
[2015-06-11 09:54:42] WhereIsMySpoon: those are important too
[2015-06-11 09:54:58] WhereIsMySpoon: i do try to build my page objects so they can be understood and extended easily
[2015-06-11 09:55:09] WhereIsMySpoon: extensibility comes under maintainability imo
[2015-06-11 09:55:24] D3M0S: 1. Maintainability 2. Readability 3. Extensibility/Reliability
[2015-06-11 09:55:32] simonstewart: Hurrah! http://www.wired.com/2015/06/facebooks-ai-tool-squashing-bugs-now-open/
[2015-06-11 09:55:36] WhereIsMySpoon: so many bilities
[2015-06-11 09:55:45] simonstewart: I've been running that over selenium as I buckify the build
[2015-06-11 09:55:49] simonstewart: Damn useful
[2015-06-11 09:55:55] lukeis: simonstewart: oooooh, nice
[2015-06-11 09:56:09] D3M0S: WhereIsMySpoon, I think of extensibility where I can use a prior test to accomplish something needed in another test
[2015-06-11 09:56:17] WhereIsMySpoon: simonstewart: sounds cool
[2015-06-11 09:56:18] jleyba: Anyone intersted in taking over the SafariDriver?
[2015-06-11 09:56:21] jleyba: like, for reals
[2015-06-11 09:56:23] D3M0S: so it makes things more maintainable for me
[2015-06-11 09:56:25] WhereIsMySpoon: jleyba: ha ha ha
[2015-06-11 09:56:54] jleyba: latest email to dev list... apparently the free Safari dev program is going away. I'm sure as hell not spending $99 so I can build the SafariDriver
[2015-06-11 09:57:18] lukeis: i have corporate apple dev program

[2015-06-11 10:01:40] barancev: also, let's try to setup a safari job on CI
[2015-06-11 10:01:56] barancev: and a phantomjs job, may be
[2015-06-11 10:02:55] barancev: it is ever possible? in view of the fact that safari extension can't be auto installed
[2015-06-11 10:04:30] barancev: and may be a job for each python/ruby/js binding
[2015-06-11 10:04:31] jleyba: lukeis, for google storage access, talk to Seva. I still have admin privileges, but I'm not involved with that team anymore, so would rather not make changes :)

[2015-06-11 14:54:12] D3M0S: qayshp, it's pretty in depth, took me a few months
[2015-06-11 14:54:19] qayshp: sorry I haven't been able to figure it out yet :( any help would be great
[2015-06-11 14:54:35] D3M0S: qayshp, so let me make sure I'm understanding your needs
[2015-06-11 14:55:04] D3M0S: because ours were slightly different, we wanted to utilize a proxy that we could command on the same thread as the test
[2015-06-11 14:55:13] D3M0S: so we could configure the proxy server to blacklist on the fly
[2015-06-11 14:55:16] D3M0S: and do some other things
[2015-06-11 14:55:42] D3M0S: you're wanting to send the node a command?

[2015-06-11 14:57:02] D3M0S: can you provide me a use case?
[2015-06-11 14:57:23] D3M0S: we can go private if you want, or stuff is semi-proprietary
[2015-06-11 14:57:25] qayshp1: basically, what we want to do is use the proxy to aggregate logs among all nodes
[2015-06-11 14:57:59] D3M0S: that's different than what I did...but I might be able to help still
[2015-06-11 14:58:03] qayshp1: and after a certain number of sessions run per node, we want to be able to run a command on the node
[2015-06-11 14:58:12] D3M0S: so DefaultRemoteProxy is a proxy that lives on the node?
[2015-06-11 14:58:30] qayshp1: yes
[2015-06-11 14:58:35] D3M0S: qayshp1, you might want to look into grid extras
[2015-06-11 14:59:01] qayshp1: right now the proxy keeps track of all sessions, and stores them to send to a central server later
[2015-06-11 14:59:36] qayshp1: what we want to add is to have the proxy tell the node to, for example and as described in the docs, restart

[2015-06-11 15:00:22] qayshp1: example from the docs: "Adding a custom Proxy
[2015-06-11 15:00:22] qayshp1: There can be situations wherein you would like to build some custom logic at each of the nodes such as “auto restart” "
[2015-06-11 15:01:04] D3M0S: can you link the docs?
[2015-06-11 15:01:22] qayshp1: of course, sorry http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/07_selenium_grid.jsp
[2015-06-11 15:01:50] qayshp1: sorry, that's the page, the paragraph is: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/07_selenium_grid.jsp#adding-a-custom-proxy
[2015-06-11 15:03:08] D3M0S: so it looks like you might want to cut your own release of the node and hub
[2015-06-11 15:03:21] rorycb, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-11 15:03:31] D3M0S: or you can do as it says in the docs
[2015-06-11 15:03:34] D3M0S: and run it via command line
[2015-06-11 15:04:26] qayshp1: maybe I'm missing what you're suggesting, sorry
[2015-06-11 15:04:46] qayshp1: we have our own wrappers around the node and hub
[2015-06-11 15:05:00] qayshp1: but I'm still not sure how I'd know which node to send a command to from the proxy
[2015-06-11 15:05:16] qayshp1: can I ask what you implemented?
[2015-06-11 15:05:30] D3M0S: you can write that logic into your hub with a servlet

[2015-06-11 15:06:28] D3M0S: qayshp1, so ours was less grid oriented than your project, we created a proxy server on the host running the code, then borrowed the browser from the node and pointed it's traffic back to the host proxy
[2015-06-11 15:06:59] D3M0S: but we have done some custom grid proxy stuff, and our old system was able to know which node it was communicating with

[2015-06-11 15:11:53] D3M0S: I think so, yes
[2015-06-11 15:12:07] D3M0S: grid extras allows you to configure your nodes to say...restart after 10 tests
[2015-06-11 15:12:21] D3M0S: or something like that, theres a ton of other stuff, again, I havent used it, just researched it a little

[2015-06-11 16:15:08] AutomatedTester: and then you ask BMP for the HAR
[2015-06-11 16:17:41] axiac: ok, so browsermob will track the times from webdriver calls ( request - response )

[2015-06-11 16:21:16] AutomatedTester: 1) WebDriver isnt concerned with the traffic level. it is a browser automation library for emulating users
[2015-06-11 16:21:30] AutomatedTester: 2) Not all browsers give this info up
[2015-06-11 16:22:28] axiac: interesting, I wonder how browsermob do that, in the end they will use webdriver, isn't ?
[2015-06-11 16:22:42] AutomatedTester: 3) browsermob does it better than us
[2015-06-11 16:23:03] AutomatedTester: browsermob is a proxy
