[2015-06-30 09:09:56] lukeis: i'd rather not check big binaries into the repo
[2015-06-30 09:10:06] simonstewart: The current PEX weighs in at 28MB
[2015-06-30 09:10:14] lukeis: that's decently large imo
[2015-06-30 09:10:23] simonstewart: That is, as you say, decently large
[2015-06-30 09:10:48] simonstewart: Right now we have the .buckversion file

[2015-06-30 09:11:59] simonstewart: I understand the words
[2015-06-30 09:12:09] lukeis: it's also known as a "release"
[2015-06-30 09:12:25] simonstewart: Possibly. I'd need to investigate how to host binaries on GH

[2015-06-30 12:53:42] AutomatedTester: anyone have any issue with having client bindings knowing the difference bewtween old firefoxdriver and marionette via a capability
[2015-06-30 12:54:50] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i'm not sure i understand the question. i mean, yeah, i get the idea, but how would that work?
[2015-06-30 12:55:40] AutomatedTester: jimevans: so populate all bindings with a "marionette" key with value set to false
[2015-06-30 12:55:53] AutomatedTester: and then if true we dont start firefox the way we normally do
[2015-06-30 12:55:59] AutomatedTester: we do it the marionette way
[2015-06-30 12:56:05] AutomatedTester: else we leave things as normal
[2015-06-30 12:56:14] AutomatedTester: and then early adopters can try it out
[2015-06-30 12:56:26] AutomatedTester: and when things are ready it's a simple pref change and away we go
[2015-06-30 12:57:57] jimevans: we're still entertaining the idea of language bindings talking directly over a socket, rather than through the http shim?
[2015-06-30 12:58:40] AutomatedTester: I would pref it to do it directly but since everyone thinks that is a silly idea I am not fighting it anymore
[2015-06-30 12:58:47] AutomatedTester: pref == prefer
[2015-06-30 13:00:14] jimevans: i don't think the idea is silly on its face. i just think using the shim makes the language binding easier to maintain.
[2015-06-30 13:00:42] jleyba: shim written in golang. we need more languages!
[2015-06-30 13:00:54] AutomatedTester: jleyba: we wrote ours in Rust

[2015-06-30 13:03:29] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I havent but it's on my todo
[2015-06-30 13:03:43] AutomatedTester: I am working quickly to see if I can release a alpha of Marionette
[2015-06-30 13:03:46] AutomatedTester: shim and all...
[2015-06-30 13:04:03] jimevans: i looked at it the other day, and it looked like the change was relatively easy.
[2015-06-30 13:04:18] jimevans: i'd do it myself if i didn't have this other stuff looming over me.
[2015-06-30 13:04:20] AutomatedTester: it should be a few lines only
[2015-06-30 13:04:29] AutomatedTester: I will try do it tomorrow
[2015-06-30 13:04:42] AutomatedTester: end of the quarter today and as a people manager I have "fun" lined up
[2015-06-30 13:04:44] jimevans: restricting the cookies returned to only display secure cookies when appropriate is more challenging.
[2015-06-30 13:05:25] jimevans: but that interface change would bring httponly cookie support to firefox driver. :)
[2015-06-30 13:06:13] AutomatedTester: jimevans: today someone came into the channel asking about
[2015-06-30 13:06:18] AutomatedTester: it

[2015-06-30 13:51:37] jleyba: jimevans, re: "only display secure cookies when appropriate". Is this a change from the spec?
[2015-06-30 13:51:56] AutomatedTester: jleyba: that's been there for some time
[2015-06-30 13:52:38] jleyba: What are we doing incorrectly now?
[2015-06-30 13:53:51] jimevans: jleyba: chrome works correctly. when browsing a site and *not* using SSL, cookies with the 'secure' flag set should not be returned by driver.manage().getAllCookies()
[2015-06-30 13:53:59] AutomatedTester: in FirefoxDriver if you ask for cookies on https://I_like.cheese you will get cookies for both  the https and http version
[2015-06-30 13:54:45] jleyba: ah
[2015-06-30 13:54:48] jimevans: AutomatedTester: that's actually okay. it when browsing the http (no 's') version that we're in the wrong.
[2015-06-30 13:55:12] jimevans: cookies without the secure flag set should be returned for both http and https sites.
[2015-06-30 13:55:52] jimevans: jleyba: though chrome doesn't return http-only flags. it'll return the cookie, but not the fact that its flagged httpOnly.
[2015-06-30 13:55:56] AutomatedTester: so what the spec describes it won't really
[2015-06-30 13:56:24] jimevans: jleyba: and neither does it return expiry dates on the cookies.
[2015-06-30 13:59:12] jimevans: AutomatedTester: not quite sure i follow that last

[2015-06-30 13:59:33] pixelport: I thought about doing a workaround by reading the cookies.sqlite for the used firefox profile. But It would be kind of fucked up.
[2015-06-30 13:59:53] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the spec describes that if you are https you cant see http and vice versa
[2015-06-30 14:00:09] AutomatedTester: pixelport: that is kinda fucked up when you can access the cookie jar via an interface :)
[2015-06-30 14:00:25] jimevans: the "cookie store associated with https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#active-document https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document-url" should include all cookies visible to the browser when pointed to the specific address, no?
[2015-06-30 14:00:54] jimevans: ugh. those URLs should read 'active document address'

[2015-06-30 14:03:22] jleyba: jimevans, I think AutomatedTester tester is right. https is a different scheme than http, so its cookies shouldn't be visible from a http page
[2015-06-30 14:03:31] jleyba: man I can't type today
[2015-06-30 14:03:35] jimevans: jleyba: but they *are*.
[2015-06-30 14:03:41] jimevans: try it in your browser.
[2015-06-30 14:03:41] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the address is the url and the url for the document is the document.documentUri
[2015-06-30 14:03:47] AutomatedTester: which includes scheme
[2015-06-30 14:04:37] AutomatedTester: according to DOM spec
[2015-06-30 14:04:48] jleyba: huh.. jimevans is right
[2015-06-30 14:04:48] jimevans: if you browse to a site that serves cookies both with and without the secure flag set, and you browse to it via https, and you inspect document.cookie, you'll get both secure and not secure cookies.
[2015-06-30 14:04:57] jleyba: document.cookie="foo=bar" on http://www.example.com
[2015-06-30 14:05:05] jleyba: the cookie is visible on https://www.example.com
[2015-06-30 14:05:24] jimevans: this is the behavior for all user agents that i know of.
