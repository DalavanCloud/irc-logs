[2015-06-28 07:38:16] smccarthy: peterjones: using java and testng?
[2015-06-28 07:38:23] p0deje, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-28 07:38:47] smccarthy: It's the part of the test runner to run tests in parallel. Not selenium, thats why more information is needed.
[2015-06-28 07:39:48] pte_petey, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-28 07:41:31] peterjones: sorry for the delay I'm using java
[2015-06-28 07:41:41] peterjones: and using jUnit
[2015-06-28 07:44:50] barancev: junit has no parallelization by itself
[2015-06-28 07:45:02] barancev: use ant/maven abilities
[2015-06-28 07:45:36] barancev: :google maven junit parallel
[2015-06-28 07:46:29] peterjones: so use testng rather than jUnit?
[2015-06-28 07:47:50] barancev: your choice :)
[2015-06-28 07:49:00] peterjones: I think maybe testNg has more options in terms of parallel tests
[2015-06-28 07:49:52] barancev: I bet you'll be disappointed in parallel test runs if you're going to run Selenium tests :)
[2015-06-28 07:50:09] barancev: massive parallelization fits unit testing well
[2015-06-28 07:50:14] barancev: not system level testing
[2015-06-28 07:50:58] barancev: CI parallel jobs are good enough for system level tests
[2015-06-28 07:51:08] barancev: no need in low level parallelization
[2015-06-28 07:51:21] peterjones: I have 2 classes I would to run at-the-same-time so, in effect open 2 different vm boxes
[2015-06-28 07:52:45] p0deje, quitting. (Quit: p0deje)
[2015-06-28 07:53:06] barancev: will you have 200 classes it would be interesting to discuss parallelization :)
[2015-06-28 07:54:12] peterjones: well I just starting to run 2 tests in parallel then increase from there
[2015-06-28 07:54:54] barancev: investigate builder abilities (maven/ant)
[2015-06-28 07:56:10] peterjones: alot to learn then
[2015-06-28 07:57:08] barancev: autotesting is hard :)
[2015-06-28 07:57:20] peterjones: ok thanks for the information barancev
[2015-06-28 07:58:27] peterjones: at them moment I have got the 2 tests running sequence not parellel
