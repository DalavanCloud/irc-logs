[2015-06-09 03:02:46] AJ_: I would like to try to add findByImage into selenium or as an extension to selenium. Can anyone help me out on whether I should create a SikuliDriver or should I just create a ImageWebElement which extends remotewebelement?

[2015-06-09 06:55:08] sfr^: to continue running the build
[2015-06-09 06:55:30] sfr^: i've tried vnc'ing into the server, but there's nothing besides the crash dialog
[2015-06-09 06:57:02] sfr^: Also, I get a lot of these log messages in the result file:
[2015-06-09 06:57:03] sfr^: info: Selenium 1.0 (Core, RC, etc) is no longer under active development. Please update to WebDriver ASAP
[2015-06-09 06:59:13] AutomatedTester: sfr^: that message looks self explanatory to me
[2015-06-09 06:59:50] sfr^: Yeah I think i understand it now. The GUI firefox plugin that I used to create my tests is deprecated, right? I need to write all my tests manually?
[2015-06-09 07:00:06] AutomatedTester: it's not deprecated
[2015-06-09 07:00:12] AutomatedTester: not to my knowledge
[2015-06-09 07:00:21] sfr^: but "no longer under active development"?
[2015-06-09 07:00:39] sfr^: any tips on the crashreporter thing?
[2015-06-09 07:00:54] AutomatedTester: are you using RC?
[2015-06-09 07:01:01] AutomatedTester: or tests from IDE?
[2015-06-09 07:01:25] sfr^: I created some tests in the Firefox extension and saved the suite as HTML files, which I use.
[2015-06-09 07:01:48] AutomatedTester: ok, not sure if RC turns off crash reporter
[2015-06-09 07:01:52] AutomatedTester: I know webdriver does
[2015-06-09 07:02:35] sfr^: I'll try using webdriver.

[2015-06-09 07:12:21] AutomatedTester: and then you should be good
[2015-06-09 07:13:42] Rancho: My chrome driver is located in C drive and i have given the correct path..but let me double check
[2015-06-09 07:15:12] Rancho: System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:/chromedriver.exe");
[2015-06-09 07:15:54] AutomatedTester: Rancho: TestNG and WebDriver can't seem to see it
[2015-06-09 07:16:20] Rancho: I see. how do i make them see it
[2015-06-09 07:17:11] AutomatedTester: you can either put it in your PATH
[2015-06-09 07:17:17] AutomatedTester: :chromedriver
[2015-06-09 07:19:48] AutomatedTester: Rancho: my java is rusty, does the path need to escaped?

[2015-06-09 07:19:59] AutomatedTester: since it's windows
[2015-06-09 07:20:25] Rancho: yeah
[2015-06-09 07:20:46] AutomatedTester: Rancho: I mean, does it need a 2nd /
[2015-06-09 07:20:53] AutomatedTester: c://chromedriver.exe
[2015-06-09 07:21:09] AutomatedTester: you have used system properties which is the other way
[2015-06-09 07:21:27] PDL: Hello, does anyone know how to enable an add-on in Firefox?
[2015-06-09 07:21:27] Rancho: that didnt work
[2015-06-09 07:21:29] AutomatedTester: the only thing I can think is that the string needs escaping or the chromedriver there doesnt actually work
[2015-06-09 07:21:41] AutomatedTester: PDL: with WebDriver?
[2015-06-09 07:22:08] PDL: Well, through Selenium
[2015-06-09 07:22:11] Rancho: System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C://chromedriver.exe"); And System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:/chromedriver.exe");
[2015-06-09 07:22:13] AutomatedTester: Rancho: and from a command prompt/powershell if you start ChromeDriver does it do anything
[2015-06-09 07:22:19] Rancho: ^ Both of them not working
[2015-06-09 07:22:25] AutomatedTester: or does it error or?
[2015-06-09 07:22:29] AutomatedTester: PDL: RC?
[2015-06-09 07:22:36] PDL: No
[2015-06-09 07:22:52] AutomatedTester: PDL: not RC or WebDriver?
[2015-06-09 07:23:00] Rancho: I was just running the same code wihtout testNg before and it was fine
[2015-06-09 07:23:06] PDL: Uh WebDriver
[2015-06-09 07:23:09] PDL: Sorry :)
[2015-06-09 07:23:23] Rancho: After i configured the TestNg, it started throwing this error..
[2015-06-09 07:23:51] AutomatedTester: Rancho: My guess is that TestNG is breaking paths somehow
[2015-06-09 07:24:06] AutomatedTester: I havent used Java in a while so not sure why
[2015-06-09 07:24:34] PDL: Firefox Plugin
[2015-06-09 07:24:36] Rancho: Hmm..but my xml and code was fine right?
[2015-06-09 07:25:02] AutomatedTester: Rancho: I think so
[2015-06-09 07:25:21] AutomatedTester: PDL: what are you trying to enable exactly?
[2015-06-09 07:26:12] PDL: Well if I go to a page it asks me to enable a plugin
[2015-06-09 07:26:29] PDL: Otherwise the page won't work
[2015-06-09 07:26:52] PDL: So I'm looking for a way to autoenable this plugin
[2015-06-09 07:27:20] AutomatedTester: PDL: what plugin
[2015-06-09 07:27:31] PDL: Internal plugin
[2015-06-09 07:27:44] PDL: So can't really tell
[2015-06-09 07:28:34] PDL: This can be just enabled at the start

[2015-06-09 08:08:33] sircapsalot: unless of course it considers an animating element "clickable", then that solution would be the best probably
[2015-06-09 08:08:47] joesmith: sircapsalot: that doesn't actually work since the item says it it clickable and visible. and actualy is(':animated') isn't working either :(
[2015-06-09 08:08:56] joesmith: i think it uses a jquery hover to move into the page

[2015-06-09 10:40:31] jleyba: D3M0S, webdriver makes extensive use of javascript. disabling JS support would break webdriver in weird ways
[2015-06-09 10:40:56] simonstewart: You could always use the htmlunitdriver (or similar) if you don't want JS execution
[2015-06-09 10:41:18] D3M0S: simonstewart, that's a good point
[2015-06-09 10:41:57] D3M0S: I've never had to do any of it, but my last place of employment wanted me to implement some disabled js stuff into the framework right before I left them.

[2015-06-09 10:59:34] santiycr: jleyba: oh, so we use any random cert for releases?

[2015-06-09 11:01:07] jleyba: it probably isn't tagged as 2.46.0, but has the latest functional code
[2015-06-09 11:01:29] santiycr: last update was in April
[2015-06-09 11:01:39] jleyba: Yup, that was the last change to the SafariDriver
[2015-06-09 11:02:26] lukeis: we don't have any official selenium apple certificates nor accountsâ€¦. I stopped attempting to make one when we abandoned IPhoneDriver
[2015-06-09 11:02:37] santiycr: I see
[2015-06-09 11:03:05] santiycr: ok, if no updates have happened to SafariDriver since April, I guess we can just release this pre-built version
[2015-06-09 11:03:09] jleyba: lukeis, We (simonstewart and I) talked with devrel at Apple about getting certificates for Selenium
[2015-06-09 11:03:24] jleyba: they didn't really know what to do with us since we are an opensource project and not a corporation

[2015-06-09 11:15:53] jimevans: at least that'd throw an error early, and wouldn't let the user blindly think that setting javascript enabled to false succeeded, when they just didn't check the returned capabilities (because no one *actually* does that).

[2015-06-09 11:57:07] lukeis: don't do circular imports :-D
[2015-06-09 11:57:29] LocusAsaf: In loginpage -> import DashboardPage -> import MainMenu -> import InfoPage -> import MainMenu

[2015-06-09 11:58:16] LocusAsaf: the MainMenu is wanting to return the correct page so it imports all the ones that it has

[2015-06-09 11:59:42] D3M0S: I'm sure somebody has come up with a design pattern to handle it though
[2015-06-09 11:59:44] D3M0S: right?
[2015-06-09 12:00:00] D3M0S: like anything circular would actually refer to a central location instead?
[2015-06-09 12:00:10] D3M0S: would that work...I dunno
[2015-06-09 12:00:21] LocusAsaf: I'm not sure I've been following advice from peoples here on the how to organize the page object stuff
[2015-06-09 12:00:36] LocusAsaf: so I'm probably missing a tip or just didn't do it quite right
[2015-06-09 12:00:57] D3M0S: LocusAsaf, I'm sure you have, I'm trying to think though my page objects and circular imports would be something I'd definitly run into if it were a problem for me in java
[2015-06-09 12:01:34] D3M0S: for example, header has login page link, click login page link go to login page, it has a header probably wiht the login page link
[2015-06-09 12:01:39] D3M0S: so right there, boom circular
[2015-06-09 12:02:50] LocusAsaf: yeah in Python it's different because when your code hits an import it actually loads the entire file that the import refers to
[2015-06-09 12:03:18] D3M0S: Dependency Injection?
[2015-06-09 12:03:22] LocusAsaf: when that file is loaded, each line is run sequentially as well and when it encounters an import...
[2015-06-09 12:03:24] LocusAsaf: well you get the idea
[2015-06-09 12:03:39] LocusAsaf: hrmm...
[2015-06-09 12:03:43] D3M0S: LocusAsaf, yeah I understand the problem, just don't really know the answer for python
[2015-06-09 12:03:51] D3M0S: DI would be the route I'd go in this scenario
[2015-06-09 12:03:56] D3M0S: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5748946/pythonic-way-to-resolve-circular-import-statements
[2015-06-09 12:04:01] D3M0S: this looks somewhat similar
[2015-06-09 12:04:14] D3M0S: the answer suggests DI, but he also has some mumbo jumbo I don't understand
[2015-06-09 12:04:23] D3M0S: pythoneese stuff
[2015-06-09 12:04:29] LocusAsaf: okay thanks I'll take a look
[2015-06-09 12:04:33] LocusAsaf: not a bad idea though in general
[2015-06-09 12:05:06] D3M0S: I use DI in java, it actually fits extremely well into page object pattern
[2015-06-09 12:05:20] D3M0S: like...supprisingly amazing good
[2015-06-09 12:05:36] D3M0S: I'd never go back to a non-DI way of doing it.
[2015-06-09 12:06:30] LocusAsaf: oh interesting
[2015-06-09 12:07:01] LocusAsaf: I need to find out about this from Python people

[2015-06-09 13:06:49] simonstewart: If we don't set the bootclasspath and you're using Java 8 on your machine, then you'll be able to access Java 8 APIs in your code
[2015-06-09 13:07:02] simonstewart: But, obviously, that'll choke when you run on Java 7

[2015-06-09 13:08:11] jleyba: You can set the target language level in IntelliJ (and presumably Eclispse)
[2015-06-09 13:08:37] simonstewart: That sets compiler features, not the available APIs
[2015-06-09 13:09:01] jleyba: Oh..eh, ok then
[2015-06-09 13:09:14] simonstewart: So two potential problems:
[2015-06-09 13:09:33] simonstewart: 1) They're stubs of a java version, so Oracle may get shirty
[2015-06-09 13:09:58] simonstewart: And the stubs take 17244k (so close to 17MB)
[2015-06-09 13:10:10] simonstewart: I might be able to trim that, but it's not going to save much
