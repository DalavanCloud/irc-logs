[2015-06-12 10:57:30] kaygee: Been reading through the support group. for the "Unable to bind to locking port" message. I checked the changelog and 2.44 appears to support 17ESR (which I'm using).
[2015-06-12 10:59:19] kaygee: The mutex port just seems to be clogged up but I can't prove it... I implemented my own FirefoxDriver (cut/paste) and attempted to assign the port myself after checking for it to not be bound.
[2015-06-12 10:59:39] kaygee: Seems like this would be a problem that'd be solved...

[2015-06-12 13:18:41] LocusAsaf: I see in examples of page object code (python) that usually people declare their selectors at the top of a class as pseudo-private class members using a tuple and the Selenium "By" object
[2015-06-12 13:18:56] LocusAsaf: how would tackle a selector that is modified during a test
[2015-06-12 13:20:29] LocusAsaf: for instance def page_func(self, unique_str): locator = (By.CSS, '.tag_{ustr} a'.format(unique_str))
[2015-06-12 13:20:34] LocusAsaf: would you all say that's acceptable
[2015-06-12 13:21:05] LocusAsaf: or do you think that I should declare that locator as a class member & then modify it in the function?
[2015-06-12 13:21:29] LocusAsaf: or should I create the preformatted string as a class member and create the tuple in the function?
[2015-06-12 13:21:47] LocusAsaf: thanks in advance

[2015-06-12 14:06:00] dude-x: LocusAsaf: so yeah i do that
[2015-06-12 14:06:29] LocusAsaf: you initialize the selector in page function?
[2015-06-12 14:06:53] dude-x: LocusAsaf: i write list_object = (By.CSS_SELECTOR, ‘#someid .class[title=\’{}\’’)
