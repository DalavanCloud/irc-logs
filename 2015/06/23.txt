[2015-06-23 10:44:21] jcun: well for my framework, i'm trying to build it in a way that the tests or page objects won't know about selenium
[2015-06-23 10:44:52] jcun: it will just know that it can call getelement and provide some sort of find expression
[2015-06-23 10:45:11] jimevans: you could devise your own system for figuring it out.
[2015-06-23 10:45:14] jcun: it may be an "id" or "cssselector"
[2015-06-23 10:45:20] jcun: yeah that's true
[2015-06-23 10:45:25] jcun: this might be the solution
[2015-06-23 10:45:34] jimevans: that is to say, have your custom locators be strings that you parse, which your framework then turns into the correct By object.
[2015-06-23 10:46:13] jimevans: i've seen other automation frameworks that do exactly that.
