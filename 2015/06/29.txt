[2015-06-29 08:18:15] AutomatedTester: TIL
[2015-06-29 08:18:18] simonstewart: We use the git revision for completely repeatable builds

[2015-06-29 08:19:26] simonstewart: But we Damn Well Should
[2015-06-29 08:19:48] AutomatedTester: kinda feels like it should since FB is investing so much in hg

[2015-06-29 08:34:40] jimevans: hooray for inconsistent driver behavior!!!
[2015-06-29 08:36:16] jimevans: consider a site that serves pages over both http and https. the site sends down cookies with and without the 'secure' flag set. for the http site, which cookies should be seen by driver.manage().getAllCookies()? which should be seen for the https site?
[2015-06-29 08:36:19] jimevans: discuss.
[2015-06-29 08:36:23] szeitlin, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-29 08:37:32] jimevans: because right now, firefox and chrome drivers behave differently. :)
[2015-06-29 08:37:48] jimevans: simonstewart, AutomatedTester: ^^
[2015-06-29 08:38:33] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: surely its still the same site, just sent over a modified protocol
[2015-06-29 08:38:42] simonstewart, quitting. (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[2015-06-29 08:38:57] jimevans: but the "secure" flag in the cookie means the browser only sees the cookie when sent over https.
[2015-06-29 08:39:33] jimevans: and (in theory) only sends those cookies back as part of http requests when browsing https.
[2015-06-29 08:39:51] jimevans: so it's not quite that simple.
[2015-06-29 08:44:10] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2015-06-29 08:44:25] WhereIsMySpoon: so send back whatever cookies are correct for the protocol type that is being used
[2015-06-29 08:44:41] WhereIsMySpoon: if i understood you correctly
[2015-06-29 08:44:57] WhereIsMySpoon: http cookies only get sent over http and not https
[2015-06-29 08:45:02] swampdragons, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-29 08:45:04] WhereIsMySpoon: and https cookies only over https and not http
[2015-06-29 08:45:05] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2015-06-29 08:45:09] jimevans: no, http cookies get sent over both.
[2015-06-29 08:45:13] WhereIsMySpoon: oh right
[2015-06-29 08:45:16] jimevans: secure cookies only get sent over https
[2015-06-29 08:45:29] jimevans: but it's a matter that needs clarification in the spec.
[2015-06-29 08:45:30] WhereIsMySpoon: yea that makes sense sorry
[2015-06-29 08:45:51] jimevans: because right now, two independent implementations (firefox and chrome) do things differently.
[2015-06-29 08:46:00] WhereIsMySpoon: so you're sending https cookies down over http connections?
[2015-06-29 08:46:20] jimevans: chrome driver doesn't return "secure" cookies for http urls. firefox does.
[2015-06-29 08:46:29] WhereIsMySpoon: that sounds quite wrong
[2015-06-29 08:46:42] jimevans: the server will send the cookie via a set-cookie header.
[2015-06-29 08:47:00] jimevans: the user agent is supposed to handle whether it's 'secure' or not, if memory serves.
[2015-06-29 08:47:08] WhereIsMySpoon: i have no clue
[2015-06-29 08:47:18] jimevans: but i may be misreading the cookie spec.
[2015-06-29 08:47:24] WhereIsMySpoon: i know more about food cookies than internet ones
[2015-06-29 08:47:26] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-06-29 08:47:41] jimevans: this is where AutomatedTester usually has more extensive knowledge than i.
[2015-06-29 08:48:12] jimevans: my concern is that i need to figure out what IE's behavior should be.
[2015-06-29 08:48:22] WhereIsMySpoon: ah
[2015-06-29 08:48:22] jimevans: should it follow firefox, or chrome?
[2015-06-29 08:48:26] WhereIsMySpoon: firefox for sure
[2015-06-29 08:48:49] AutomatedTester: I would need to reread the cookie RFC
[2015-06-29 08:48:54] jimevans: actually, the right answer is "follow the spec", but the spec is silent on the matter at the mo.
[2015-06-29 08:49:03] jimevans: :)
[2015-06-29 08:49:10] torlanco, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-06-29 08:49:13] AutomatedTester: but I would say Chrome is doing it properly
[2015-06-29 08:49:16] Dave_B_: I'd follow chrome based only on your description above :p
[2015-06-29 08:49:19] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2015-06-29 08:49:22] WhereIsMySpoon: why?
[2015-06-29 08:49:27] AutomatedTester: jimevans: actually the spec does handle it
[2015-06-29 08:49:28] WhereIsMySpoon: send all https cookies as http?
[2015-06-29 08:49:32] WhereIsMySpoon: that sounds wrong to me..
[2015-06-29 08:49:37] Dave_B_: 'chrome driver doesn't return "secure" cookies for http urls. firefox does.'
[2015-06-29 08:49:47] WhereIsMySpoon: oh
[2015-06-29 08:49:49] WhereIsMySpoon: i misread
[2015-06-29 08:49:49] jimevans: it handles what to do with "secure" cookies when browsing http urls?
[2015-06-29 08:50:01] WhereIsMySpoon: i thought jim said https
[2015-06-29 08:50:02] WhereIsMySpoon: not http
[2015-06-29 08:50:14] WhereIsMySpoon: in that case yea, chrome
[2015-06-29 08:50:58] jimevans: in other news, this logic in the IE driver is all kinds of screwed up.
[2015-06-29 08:51:11] jimevans: (and that's all on me :) )
[2015-06-29 08:51:13] WhereIsMySpoon: \\o/
[2015-06-29 08:51:17] WhereIsMySpoon: oops
[2015-06-29 08:51:20] WhereIsMySpoon: my man has an extra arm
[2015-06-29 08:51:40] jimevans: but the concept works at least.
[2015-06-29 08:51:42] WhereIsMySpoon: \o\/o/
[2015-06-29 08:51:47] WhereIsMySpoon: stacked men
[2015-06-29 08:51:51] WhereIsMySpoon: sorry, ill stop now.
[2015-06-29 08:51:52] dimacus: WhereIsMySpoon: ahh comrade from chernobyl
[2015-06-29 08:51:56] jimevans: now i just have to refine the logic.
[2015-06-29 08:51:59] WhereIsMySpoon: dimacus: rofl
[2015-06-29 08:52:33] *dimacus was born 2 months before the fateful day, and had relatives die from it, therefore allowed to make jokes'
[2015-06-29 08:53:23] jimevans: btw, given the interactions between 'secure' and http/s urls, it's possible to set a cookie with webdriver that then cannot be retrieved.
[2015-06-29 08:54:03] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the webdriver spec says Chrome is doing it properly
[2015-06-29 08:54:17] AutomatedTester: jimevans: step 4
[2015-06-29 08:54:18] jimevans: a'ight.
[2015-06-29 08:54:26] AutomatedTester: of Get Cookie
[2015-06-29 08:54:40] AutomatedTester: the active document address
[2015-06-29 08:54:58] jimevans: a-ha. yep. that'd do it.
[2015-06-29 08:54:59] AutomatedTester: address links to the DOM's spec description of URL
[2015-06-29 08:55:10] jimevans: answers my question.
[2015-06-29 08:55:26] AutomatedTester: which doesnt spell it out but it distinguishes between http and https
[2015-06-29 08:55:28] jimevans: still need to update the algorithm to handle http-only cookies.
[2015-06-29 08:55:32] AutomatedTester: yes
[2015-06-29 08:55:59] jimevans: now to fix IE!
[2015-06-29 08:56:03] jimevans: For Science!
[2015-06-29 08:56:45] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: ForScience is actually my steam "clan" tag

[2015-06-29 09:59:24] jimevans: captnkilljoy: it tries to be idiomatic to the language you're writing in. so .NET languages will see properties instead of all methods, python and ruby flatten the object model because there are no role-based interfaces to handle, and javascript uses promises to try to enforce synchronous behavior.

[2015-06-29 10:13:00] jimevans: minm_: native events will be entirely broken on firefox after firefox version 33. it just plain won't work. the .so files that need to be loaded by the browser can't be compiled with versions of the gecko sdk after 33.
[2015-06-29 10:14:08] minm_: so you mean to say that the version of the browser which is present on my jenkins machine is below 33

[2015-06-29 10:50:44] mekhami: Accept-Language header?
[2015-06-29 10:51:13] mekhami: apparently our varnish server will have some geo logic and set the locale in the header
[2015-06-29 10:51:22] mekhami: so... time to rethink
[2015-06-29 10:51:25] D3M0S: mekhami, hummmm, I can look into it, but I'm not super aware of specifics, I usually just ask my developer how it's being done
[2015-06-29 10:51:41] mekhami: heh i am trying the same thing =P
[2015-06-29 10:51:46] D3M0S: also if it's done in the header, you might be able to use a cookie editor

[2015-06-29 10:52:13] dgempesaw: you could use a proxy to inject the header into your requests, also
[2015-06-29 10:52:21] D3M0S: that too :)

[2015-06-29 10:54:23] mekhami: can you not just set a header in the request in the driver?
[2015-06-29 10:54:32] D3M0S: you can
[2015-06-29 10:54:45] D3M0S: but sometimes the site might overwrite it
[2015-06-29 10:55:13] D3M0S: so it looks like accept language has the standard "keyboard" inputs
[2015-06-29 10:55:22] D3M0S:   Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7
[2015-06-29 10:55:27] D3M0S: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html
[2015-06-29 10:55:38] D3M0S: en-gb == english great britian
[2015-06-29 10:55:42] mekhami: right
[2015-06-29 10:55:57] D3M0S: so first waht I'd try
[2015-06-29 10:56:10] D3M0S: is using that Accept-Language string I just provided
[2015-06-29 10:56:18] D3M0S: and doing a driver.manage.cookie I think
[2015-06-29 10:56:22] D3M0S: and add a cookie
[2015-06-29 10:56:35] D3M0S: then check that you get a redirect
[2015-06-29 10:56:49] D3M0S: that's the simplest way
[2015-06-29 10:57:23] D3M0S: when you add a cookie though, you have to be on the site already

[2015-06-29 10:57:50] D3M0S: back when I had to do a lot of cookie stuff, I just had the developers create me a "cookie page" that was a blank page on the domain
[2015-06-29 10:57:51] D3M0S: in test only
[2015-06-29 10:58:13] D3M0S: go to that page, add the cookie, then go wherever I needed
[2015-06-29 10:58:57] D3M0S: you can feasabily use any page, but I decided that I didn't want to wait for any load time while adding the cookie
[2015-06-29 10:59:31] jimevans: and with that commit, that fixes the last major feature gap in the IE driver.
[2015-06-29 10:59:43] *D3M0S cheers'
[2015-06-29 11:00:27] D3M0S: mekhami, also if you didnt' know header == cookie
[2015-06-29 11:00:52] mekhami: D3M0S: appreciate your help!
[2015-06-29 11:00:59] lukeis: err…. a cookie is sent as a Header… but not all headers are cookies ;)
[2015-06-29 11:01:07] D3M0S: lukeis, correct
[2015-06-29 11:01:12] D3M0S: I guess it's not ==
[2015-06-29 11:01:15] D3M0S: it's a one way relationship
[2015-06-29 11:01:52] D3M0S: for "most" cases

[2015-06-29 12:56:15] jimevans: okay, now. can anyone explain why the chrome driver doesn't return cookie expiration times?
[2015-06-29 12:56:57] jimevans: and neither the firefox nor the chrome drivers return httpOnly status of a cookie.
[2015-06-29 12:59:27] Kyl9, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-29 13:00:08] barancev: jimevans: because we need servlet-api 3 to get access to httpOnly property
[2015-06-29 13:00:29] barancev: that implies jetty upgrade
[2015-06-29 13:00:57] barancev: and I know someone who promiced...
[2015-06-29 13:01:01] jimevans: barancev: i'm not sure i follow.
[2015-06-29 13:01:14] jimevans: i totally get if that's why the test is disabled.
[2015-06-29 13:01:25] jimevans: i'm wondering why the drivers don't actually *do* it.
[2015-06-29 13:01:44] jimevans: they return http-only cookies, but not the http-only flag in the response json.
[2015-06-29 13:04:23] barancev: 1 min....
[2015-06-29 13:07:53] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-29 13:10:07] barancev: jimevans: sorry, I was wrong about the answer to your question
[2015-06-29 13:10:42] barancev: old servlet-api is the reason why we can't create a test that checks httpOnly cookies
[2015-06-29 13:10:57] epteixeira, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-06-29 13:11:32] barancev: because we can't implement CookieServlet properly, servlet-api 2 does not allow to set httpOnly flag
[2015-06-29 13:12:05] barancev: but I don't know why the driver don't set this property
[2015-06-29 13:12:15] barancev: the drivers
[2015-06-29 13:13:49] jimevans: i had to create a website for myself that would create httponly cookies so i could make sure the IE driver logic was right. that was where i noticed that none of the other drivers return the info in the json response.
[2015-06-29 13:15:23] barancev: in firefox driver we use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsICookie
[2015-06-29 13:16:31] barancev: time to go to nsICookie2

[2015-06-29 13:23:38] jimevans: good to know.

[2015-06-29 13:28:15] jimevans: i dare say the change in the firefox driver and marionette would be a damned sight easier than what one has to go through for IE. :)
