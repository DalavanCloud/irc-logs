I am on OSX with FF 38. Working via WebDriver. Use Java for scripting tests. Suggested patch doesn't work for me. Any ideas welcome!

[2015-06-13 10:22:02] minm: hey everyone
[2015-06-13 10:23:39] minm: I am a rookie automation tester
[2015-06-13 10:24:19] minm: who has just started to write testcases in selenium webdriver in java technology
[2015-06-13 10:24:32] minm: I am facing a problem
[2015-06-13 10:25:12] minm: I have written 7 testcases which are dependent on each other
[2015-06-13 10:25:28] minm: though I have prioritized them
[2015-06-13 10:26:05] max___: Hi minm!
[2015-06-13 10:26:15] max___: Your fun is just starting! ))
[2015-06-13 10:27:41] minm: hi max
[2015-06-13 10:27:53] minm: i know that
[2015-06-13 10:27:57] minm: umm
[2015-06-13 10:28:23] minm: I am using one method in all the seven testcases
[2015-06-13 10:28:51] minm: and it runs in some testcases but fails in other
[2015-06-13 10:29:08] minm: I am facing another strange problem
[2015-06-13 10:29:22] max___: Do you use PageObject approach? (I am also new to Selenium)
[2015-06-13 10:29:44] minm: whenever i run the testcases and keep an eye on how they are being executed
[2015-06-13 10:30:00] minm: yes i am using that page object model
[2015-06-13 10:30:47] minm: whenever i run the testcases and keep an eye on how they are being executed
[2015-06-13 10:30:55] minm: they don't fail
[2015-06-13 10:31:03] max___: when you look at them - they work. when you don't - they do not?
[2015-06-13 10:31:08] minm: yes
[2015-06-13 10:31:21] max___: the same issue here... )))
[2015-06-13 10:31:23] minm: i dont know but it's bit weird
[2015-06-13 10:31:29] minm: :P
[2015-06-13 10:31:54] minm: I have tried a lot of things
[2015-06-13 10:32:02] max___: I found one solution --- more and more checks and cross checks... For me it is often that test loses idea where it is located on website...
[2015-06-13 10:32:07] max___: I will implement URL check
[2015-06-13 10:32:12] minm: I have applied waitfor element visibility
[2015-06-13 10:33:16] minm: I have no idea about url check
[2015-06-13 10:33:19] max___: does it work?
[2015-06-13 10:33:23] minm: can u please elaborate
[2015-06-13 10:33:40] minm: nope wait for element visibility din't work
[2015-06-13 10:33:44] minm: neither did sleep
[2015-06-13 10:33:51] max___: URL check --- it is my workaround -- to see where on the website I am located. because waitfor doesn't work in my cases all the time....
[2015-06-13 10:34:05] minm: okay
[2015-06-13 10:34:18] max___: I do tests across several sites... so, I kind of lose context..
[2015-06-13 10:34:25] minm: ok
[2015-06-13 10:34:35] max___: But do you see stack traces, what do they say?
[2015-06-13 10:35:03] max___: Also I will implement more and more logging. I think this will help to nail down the problem.. (problems..)
[2015-06-13 10:35:30] minm: yes
[2015-06-13 10:35:42] minm: I have checked the logs
[2015-06-13 10:35:48] minm: i mean the stack traces
[2015-06-13 10:36:34] minm: basically my testcase to write some text in a textbox
[2015-06-13 10:36:42] minm: is*
[2015-06-13 10:37:19] minm: and after that I have to save the text and go to some other page
[2015-06-13 10:37:33] minm: and assert that whether that text is present on that page or not
[2015-06-13 10:38:54] minm: but it fails in assertion
[2015-06-13 10:39:18] minm: as the text which was to be entered by the method is not being entered in some cases
[2015-06-13 10:40:38] minm: so blank screen appears on the next page where I am asserting that whether the text which I had entered has appeared or not.
[2015-06-13 10:41:40] minm: coz nothing is written by the java method which I am using to write some random text
[2015-06-13 10:42:37] minm: but at the same time that same method writes text in some of the other testcases
[2015-06-13 10:45:51] max___: nightmare....
[2015-06-13 10:46:55] max___: start with nailing down the problem. make as minimal problem reproducing test as possible. maybe this will help you to understand the problem... maybe the site you test is buggy?
[2015-06-13 10:48:15] minm: nope it isn't coz the same method writes some text in that same textbox many a times
[2015-06-13 10:48:55] minm: and I have tested that manually as well
[2015-06-13 10:49:26] max___: could it be random behaviour of the site?
[2015-06-13 10:51:43] minm: i dont know
[2015-06-13 10:52:02] max___: testing nightmare )))
[2015-06-13 10:52:04] minm: but I can't rule out the possibility
[2015-06-13 10:52:42] minm: I am executing the testcases again and I am looking at them
[2015-06-13 10:52:47] minm: and they are working fine
[2015-06-13 10:52:50] max___: I am developing testing strategy at the moment. It is will be very defensive.
[2015-06-13 10:52:59] max___: I do understand you...
[2015-06-13 10:54:24] max___: Unfortunately cannot give you any good advice - I am also new here... and I am also looking for some help
[2015-06-13 10:56:15] minm: okay
[2015-06-13 10:56:19] minm: no problem
