[2015-06-17 05:25:06] sircapsalot: one trick i do for some apps here where I am that require auth - I will use simple http auth.  In the setUp method, i will do something like:  driver.get 'http://username:password@app.internal.com'

[2015-06-17 06:25:52] g00ey: what do you mean by dedicated grid?
[2015-06-17 06:26:06] sircapsalot: have a grid, then at least one node connected to the grid.
[2015-06-17 06:26:22] g00ey: ok
[2015-06-17 06:26:23] sircapsalot: when you fire a test, fire it at the grid.  it will then find the "most available" node, and run the test there
[2015-06-17 06:26:38] sircapsalot: the node being a computer that is not yours
[2015-06-17 06:26:45] sircapsalot: otherwise the browser will still show up on your computer.
[2015-06-17 06:27:16] sircapsalot: so basically, this solution still isn't "hiding" the browser per se.. it just shows up on a different computer so it doesn't clutter your workspace

[2015-06-17 12:10:30] jimevans: the active document piece is crystal clear.
[2015-06-17 12:10:38] jimevans: and answered my initial question perfectly.

[2015-06-17 12:15:34] D3M0S: so I'm iterating over rows in a table, and building a row object for each row
[2015-06-17 12:15:38] D3M0S: theres a table filter

[2015-06-17 12:16:32] gabecase: is it possible your loop iterates too many times
[2015-06-17 12:16:33] sircapsalot: ignore that ^
[2015-06-17 12:16:41] AutomatedTester: jimevans: that would make it simpler
[2015-06-17 12:16:57] gabecase: D3M0S sounds like your iterator/loop condition may be an issue
[2015-06-17 12:17:01] D3M0S: gabecase, no, because my List of WebElements is size 44 also

[2015-06-17 12:17:30] D3M0S:     List<WebElement> rowElements = table.findElements(By.tagName("tr"));
[2015-06-17 12:17:36] jimevans: AutomatedTester: but the point being that calling the endpoint with no {name} parameter returns all cookies, calling it with a {name} parameter yields the specific cookie, if present. unknown what happens if you ask for a specific cookie and it doesn't exist.
[2015-06-17 12:18:08] jimevans: what "all cookies" means, is, yes, quite implementation-specific

[2015-06-17 12:18:42] jimevans: at least, that's how i'd see it, unless i'm missing something.
[2015-06-17 12:18:53] AutomatedTester: sircapsalot: can we not do merge commits please
[2015-06-17 12:19:18] D3M0S: gabecase, I had it another way but I broke it down to make sure it wasn't somehow finding hidden "yui-dt-body"s elsewhere
[2015-06-17 12:19:46] gabecase: var rows = webDriver.findElements(By.cssSelector("yui-dt-body tr"));
[2015-06-17 12:20:00] gabecase: something like that
[2015-06-17 12:20:01] sircapsalot: the last one i did wasn't, was it?  i just signed off a cherry-picked commit
[2015-06-17 12:20:04] D3M0S: gabecase, let me try it
[2015-06-17 12:20:14] sircapsalot: the penultimate one i had done, was a merge commit.. which lukeis already told me about
[2015-06-17 12:20:19] gabecase: sorry not clear, your using .NET right
[2015-06-17 12:20:30] D3M0S: gabecase, Java
[2015-06-17 12:21:02] gabecase: List<WebElement> rows = webDriver.findElements(By.cssSelector("yui-dt-body tr"));

[2015-06-17 12:57:29] AutomatedTester: sircapsalot: the documentation is quite good so tend to find what I want there or by looking in a few of the mozilla projects
[2015-06-17 12:57:57] sircapsalot: AutomatedTester yea, i use servo quite a bit to see how they organize the project
[2015-06-17 12:58:19] AutomatedTester: they way they organise that project makes me angry

[2015-06-17 12:59:08] AutomatedTester: I understand why they are doing it but it just makes adding changes between repos
[2015-06-17 12:59:50] AutomatedTester: sircapsalot: I added rebeccapurple to gecko and servo as a tribute to Eric Meyer
[2015-06-17 13:00:06] AutomatedTester: and testing servo with the change was so so hard

[2015-06-17 13:38:17] Ardesco: I’m running a threadlocal that starts a webdriver object so it should be isolated
[2015-06-17 13:38:24] Ardesco: (note I said *should*)
[2015-06-17 13:39:16] lukeis: start chromedrivers on different ports, use the thread-id to increment the base port number, capture the chromedriver log and see? :)

[2015-06-17 13:40:44] lukeis: WebDriverWait
[2015-06-17 13:40:44] Ardesco: i suspect it’s something to do with iFrame handling
[2015-06-17 13:40:48] lukeis: ? :-D
[2015-06-17 13:40:58] Ardesco: I’m using webdriver waits :)
[2015-06-17 13:41:06] lukeis: figured
[2015-06-17 13:41:21] Ardesco: that’s whats eventually timing out with a NoSuchElementException
[2015-06-17 13:41:35] Ardesco: I thin i’m somehow getting bounced into the wrong iframe
[2015-06-17 13:41:39] Ardesco: *think
[2015-06-17 13:41:47] Ardesco: hence why it can’t find the element

[2015-06-17 13:45:00] Ardesco: lack of repo steps?
[2015-06-17 13:45:06] Ardesco: no reproducible test case?
[2015-06-17 13:45:10] Ardesco: special secret code?
[2015-06-17 13:45:19] jimevans: Ardesco: that's my biggest thing is no repro case.
[2015-06-17 13:45:30] lukeis: the first two or in general lack of a proper bug report
[2015-06-17 13:45:44] jimevans: if i can see it, and repro it, i have at least a fighting chance to fix it.
[2015-06-17 13:46:00] Ardesco: i thought that may be a big one :)

[2015-06-17 13:46:24] lukeis: it's the ones that are grey area that make it hard to immediately close… there might be an issue, but can't really tell for sure, and they don't explicitly call out everything

[2015-06-17 14:42:10] lukeis: and welcome!
[2015-06-17 14:43:05] joshbruning: I guess so.

[2015-06-17 14:44:07] joshbruning: jimevans: (or anyone else who would know) - I'm wondering how difficult it would be to get /session/:sessionId/log similar to what Chrome returns for the log type "browser"
[2015-06-17 14:44:27] joshbruning: For any version of IE
[2015-06-17 14:44:46] lukeis: jim's the *only* one who would know :)

[2015-06-17 14:46:01] joshbruning: Mostly users are concerned with seeing any JavaScript errors - really helps cut down the debug time for issues.
[2015-06-17 14:46:20] jimevans: joshbruning: get simonstewart to quit saying he's not happy with either side of the logging interface (neither he nor i are happy with the "server" side nor the "client" side), and we can talk
[2015-06-17 14:46:30] jimevans: but you won't get javascript errors anyway
[2015-06-17 14:46:43] jimevans: IE makes it nearly impossible to catch those
[2015-06-17 14:46:53] jimevans: and display them out-of-process.
[2015-06-17 14:47:21] Padawan_, changing nick to Padawan.
[2015-06-17 14:47:27] joshbruning: I see - I suppose there's no decent way to override everyone's onerror handler...
[2015-06-17 14:47:30] lukeis: window.onerror = function(e) { window.errors_found.apeend(e)};   ?   then fetch them later
[2015-06-17 14:47:49] lukeis: yeah, that'll get messy
[2015-06-17 14:47:51] jimevans: proxy server ftw!
[2015-06-17 14:48:03] jimevans: that way you can catch onload errors too!

[2015-06-17 14:49:19] joshbruning: Yes, the proxy server is definitely doable as a workaround - great post.
[2015-06-17 14:49:37] joshbruning: Browser agnostic is great.
[2015-06-17 14:50:18] joshbruning: So is there any alternative proposal under consideration for the logging interface?
[2015-06-17 14:50:28] joshbruning: (or is it just the case no one is happy)
[2015-06-17 14:50:47] jimevans: not that i'm aware of. but i honestly don't have time to think hard about it right now.
[2015-06-17 14:51:31] joshbruning: The one I like the least is the iframe interface. :-)

[2015-06-17 15:31:03] lukeis: 10ESR ??? wat?
[2015-06-17 15:31:14] lukeis: FF 38 is the latest
[2015-06-17 15:31:31] lukeis: 2.46 is what you should use
[2015-06-17 15:33:26] kaygee: I know what I "should" use... Looking for versions that are actually working with 2.44.
[2015-06-17 15:34:37] kaygee: Are you using 2.46 and FFX38? ;)
[2015-06-17 15:34:40] D3M0S: kaygee, If I remember correctly FF35
[2015-06-17 15:34:53] D3M0S: or FF34
[2015-06-17 15:35:51] lukeis: kaygee: actually working on getting that running in our ci now ;)  but if you want to know the firefox versions with selenium version, read the java :changelog
