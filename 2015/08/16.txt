[2015-08-16 03:21:17] iseedeadcode: it was different error before btw
[2015-08-16 03:21:35] Ardesco: probably best using something like this to paste in the future https://gist.github.com
[2015-08-16 03:21:50] Ardesco: So that error is telling you that at line 87 something is null
[2015-08-16 03:21:54] Ardesco: when it shouldn’t be
[2015-08-16 03:22:04] Ardesco: Best course of action is set a break point on line 87
[2015-08-16 03:22:21] Ardesco: debug the code and examine the variable when the break point is hit to work out what is null
[2015-08-16 03:27:49] iseedeadcode: everything is okey with variable
[2015-08-16 03:27:54] iseedeadcode: i see it in avriables

[2015-08-16 03:30:02] Ardesco: pfft
[2015-08-16 03:30:14] Ardesco: you can see the variable, but what is the value
[2015-08-16 03:30:19] Ardesco: some variable is set to null
[2015-08-16 03:30:36] iseedeadcode: the same i gave it :) didn't saw null values for anything let me try again
[2015-08-16 03:31:06] Ardesco: the stack trace is saying that something is null on line 87
[2015-08-16 03:32:01] Ardesco: you are probably best off putting up :gist of your code so that we can see it
[2015-08-16 03:32:46] Ardesco: I’m about to go out though so hopefuly somebody else will be able to help
[2015-08-16 03:32:57] Ardesco: I’ll check in when I get back

[2015-08-16 08:30:14] iseedeadcode: hello Ardesco :)
[2015-08-16 08:30:22] iseedeadcode: i have been waiting for you :D
[2015-08-16 08:36:36] Ardesco: hello
[2015-08-16 08:36:42] Ardesco: ooking at that line 87 is obsolete
[2015-08-16 08:36:46] Ardesco: *looking
[2015-08-16 08:38:00] Ardesco: you are also mixing implicit waits with explicit waits which is going to cause problems
[2015-08-16 08:38:07] Ardesco: pick one and stick with it
[2015-08-16 08:38:57] iseedeadcode: actually this is the only way how test passes further
[2015-08-16 08:39:29] Ardesco: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeYig60BNKs
[2015-08-16 08:39:49] Ardesco: You can see me talking about why mixing waits is bad
[2015-08-16 08:40:11] iseedeadcode: listening
[2015-08-16 08:40:23] Ardesco: Your isElementPresent function is not really needed
[2015-08-16 08:41:35] iseedeadcode: there were lots of not used stuff, i removed it so if i have to show it again it won't be sucha a mess
[2015-08-16 08:42:21] Ardesco: have you got more up to date code then, and a new stack trace?
[2015-08-16 08:43:17] iseedeadcode: http://pastebin.com/nnWryNPR
[2015-08-16 08:43:28] iseedeadcode: can't get stack trace i got banned on this website :D my ip got blocked
[2015-08-16 08:45:08] Ardesco: So if this is an exam for a job writing Selenium tests you aren’t ready yet
[2015-08-16 08:46:27] iseedeadcode: i am trying to be ready i spent last 20 hours googling and trying to make this work. I also finished all steps the only one that doesn't work is that i can't assertTrue that my review is present
[2015-08-16 08:46:37] Ardesco: Pick onw timeout method and stick with it, right now your explicit waits are pointless because you have an implciit wait of 30 seconds set
[2015-08-16 08:47:09] Ardesco: You don’t need to create 2 wait objects, you can just create one and reuse it
[2015-08-16 08:48:33] Ardesco: You could set this: By.cssSelector(".wh-rating-choices-holder") : as a variable so that you just pass it in every time you use it
[2015-08-16 08:48:47] Ardesco: You want to have a look at page objects to reduce the clutter
[2015-08-16 08:50:49] Ardesco: I would guess that the attribute “feeddesc” is either null, or doesn’t exist
[2015-08-16 08:51:27] iseedeadcode: it is possible that it's hidden ? and you need to first hover over object then it will see it ?
[2015-08-16 08:51:43] Ardesco: also it looks lik you’ve pasted your username and password, I would either change your password or pull that paste down
[2015-08-16 08:52:11] iseedeadcode: i can't show you the html that used there because i am banned by IP.
[2015-08-16 08:52:11] Ardesco: visbilitiy is irrelevant when getting an attribute
[2015-08-16 08:52:13] iseedeadcode: yeah i did it
[2015-08-16 08:52:59] iseedeadcode: this paste will be deleted in a hour
[2015-08-16 08:54:16] iseedeadcode: <p class="feeddesc">“review"</p>
[2015-08-16 08:54:29] iseedeadcode: that's where my review is
[2015-08-16 08:55:51] Ardesco: let me add some comments and sitck it back up
[2015-08-16 08:56:34] Ardesco: right that makes sense then
[2015-08-16 08:56:43] Ardesco: feeddesc is not an attribute, it’s a class
[2015-08-16 08:56:47] Ardesco: class is the attribute
[2015-08-16 08:57:59] iseedeadcode: review.getAttribute("class").contains("feedesc");
[2015-08-16 08:58:02] iseedeadcode: then this way
[2015-08-16 08:59:02] leandroal, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-16 09:00:06] Ardesco: that would work
[2015-08-16 09:00:56] iseedeadcode: this way it will find where my review is hold. but can i assertture it to my variable where my initial review is hold ?
[2015-08-16 09:02:39] iseedeadcode: i knwo it's will look awful but i think it would be more understanable
[2015-08-16 09:03:02] iseedeadcode: assertTrue(review.getAttribute("feeddesc").contains("feeddesc")) equalsTo(review_Text);
[2015-08-16 09:03:39] Ardesco: have a look at this http://pastebin.com/ELXc02Y0
[2015-08-16 09:09:05] iseedeadcode: so
[2015-08-16 09:09:06] iseedeadcode: WebElement review = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#activity10364705"));
[2015-08-16 09:09:06] iseedeadcode:         review.getAttribute("feeddesc").contains("review_text");
[2015-08-16 09:09:06] iseedeadcode:         assertTrue(review.getAttribute("feeddesc").contains("review_text"));
[2015-08-16 09:09:10] iseedeadcode: if I do this
[2015-08-16 09:09:17] iseedeadcode: the second line is obsolete and not needed

[2015-08-16 09:10:36] kggr, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-16 09:22:45] Ardesco: the middle line is obsolete
[2015-08-16 09:23:05] Ardesco: but you will want to change the last line to:
[2015-08-16 09:23:13] Ardesco: assertTrue(review.getAttribute("class").contains("feedesc”));
[2015-08-16 09:25:10] iseedeadcode: assertTrue(review.getAttribute("class").contains("feeddesc")) equalsTo(review_Text); how to implement something like that ? AS I understand aasserttrue will just go find  class named feeddesc and will that's that it's true
[2015-08-16 09:25:25] iseedeadcode: but i need to verify that in class feeddesc is my review_text
[2015-08-16 09:25:53] Ardesco: so it sounds like you are getting confused
[2015-08-16 09:26:12] Ardesco: you have found an element in the dom that you have called reveiw
[2015-08-16 09:26:24] Ardesco: you are then looking at the class attribute for that element
[2015-08-16 09:26:34] Ardesco: and checking that is contains the text feeddesc
[2015-08-16 09:26:42] Ardesco: It sounds like you want to
[2015-08-16 09:26:50] Ardesco: find the element that has the class feeddesc
[2015-08-16 09:26:56] Ardesco: and then look at the text for that element
[2015-08-16 09:27:08] Ardesco: in which case you will need to do something like:
[2015-08-16 09:27:31] iseedeadcode: not just look at it, verify that class feeddesc has the same text that i stored in variable review_Text
[2015-08-16 09:27:33] Ardesco: WebElement review = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(“.feeddesc”))
[2015-08-16 09:27:59] Ardesco: assertTrue(review.getText().equals(review_text));
[2015-08-16 09:28:10] Ardesco: classes don’t hold text
[2015-08-16 09:28:28] smccarthy: iseedeadcode: btw, nth-child won't work on IE8 or below (incase you have to test on that browser).
[2015-08-16 09:28:29] Ardesco: classes are applied to elements in the DOM
[2015-08-16 09:29:06] iseedeadcode: smccarthy: is it because it's HTML 5 stuff ?
[2015-08-16 09:29:24] Ardesco: IE8 doesn’t fully support HTML5
[2015-08-16 09:29:34] Ardesco: it’s was written before HTML5 was a thing
[2015-08-16 09:29:48] Ardesco: MS won’t support it from January
[2015-08-16 09:29:54] Ardesco: (IE8 that is)
[2015-08-16 09:30:36] elyograg: a generally true statement, in regex:  IE\d+ doesn't fully support .*

[2015-08-16 09:31:41] smccarthy: I don't have to support it with my tests :)
[2015-08-16 09:31:58] Ardesco: it will find the first one in the DOM it comes across
[2015-08-16 09:32:05] iseedeadcode: perfect
[2015-08-16 09:32:35] Ardesco: smccarthy: Windows 10 being a free upgrade was in an attempt to get rid of IE8
[2015-08-16 09:32:52] Ardesco: I don’t know why you would use it unless you are stuck on a corp machine that cannot be upgraded
[2015-08-16 09:33:32] iseedeadcode: i use almost each release IE 6 which is sad
[2015-08-16 09:33:39] smccarthy: Ardesco: I have just found that a lot of companies use out-dated, unsupported software. Like people still using java 6 :)
[2015-08-16 09:34:05] Ardesco: yup, but MS refusing to support it from Janurary is making companies upgrade
[2015-08-16 09:34:11] Ardesco: Slowly maybe, but it is happening
[2015-08-16 09:34:16] smccarthy: hopefully! that is good news
[2015-08-16 09:34:54] iseedeadcode: my company wanted to upgrade upgrade to windows 10, but it doesn't support cisco vpn
[2015-08-16 09:35:08] iseedeadcode: so we are waiting for this to be resolved
[2015-08-16 09:36:04] Ardesco: it will happen :)

[2015-08-16 09:37:29] iseedeadcode: i read somewhere that cortana sends to MS 80mb of data each 15 mins or so
[2015-08-16 09:37:33] iseedeadcode: if am not mistaken
[2015-08-16 09:37:47] Ardesco: You think Google doesn’t know everything abot you already?
[2015-08-16 09:37:55] Ardesco: or your mobile phone provider
[2015-08-16 09:37:58] Ardesco: or Apple
[2015-08-16 09:38:00] Ardesco: or Amazon
[2015-08-16 09:38:03] Ardesco: or Facebook
[2015-08-16 09:38:07] Ardesco: etc
[2015-08-16 09:38:38] iseedeadcode: i am not against it, I personally don't care. I asked in case i would have new arguments when people ask :)
[2015-08-16 09:39:04] iseedeadcode: i think if MS reads my chat history or something like that they will be bored as hell :D
[2015-08-16 09:39:37] Ardesco: i think it’s shit, but i don’t get why people are upset with MS and nobody else
[2015-08-16 09:40:24] iseedeadcode: yeah, agree google has been at it for more than 8 years i think and when MS does it everyone loses their mind
