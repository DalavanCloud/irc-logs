[2015-08-10 04:58:24] teneicent: it ran the first one then ended the test
[2015-08-10 04:58:45] teneicent: apparently you have to have one long function or something but i need to have a lot of little subfunctions
[2015-08-10 05:00:05] sgsabbage: firstly, for each test function, you need to call them test<rest of function name>
[2015-08-10 05:00:17] sgsabbage: AucionForms won't run

[2015-08-10 05:00:54] sgsabbage: also, as setUp will be called before each method, you probably want to create a tearDown method which closes all the browsers
[2015-08-10 05:01:34] teneicent: i have a teardown at the end

[2015-08-10 07:22:45] dude-x: appium seems to work without that extra tap, but it i have seen by doing a tap before text entry makes less flaky.
[2015-08-10 07:23:06] dude-x: so i'm wondering if this is a best practice based on your experience.
[2015-08-10 07:24:04] dude-x: also at this moment we are doing mobile automation against simulators, but for simplish apps, how important is using a native device
[2015-08-10 07:24:17] optionsbob: I have WebElement query = driver.findElement(By.id("AllContent_ContentMain_QuoteTableDownloadCtl1_cmdSubmit")); query.sendKeys("GOOG");

[2015-08-10 07:24:44] sgsabbage: dude-x: I haven't found any problems on a native device that I haven't found on a simulator - bearing in mind that I've only done stuff on iOS
[2015-08-10 07:24:45] dude-x: is that really an ID? longest ID i've ever seen
[2015-08-10 07:24:49] optionsbob: WhereIsMySpoon, I know I shouldn't but I can't get curl to do it
[2015-08-10 07:25:32] sgsabbage: also, yeah, while I think Appium is the best of what's out there, I really can't wait for Xcode 7 with its new UI testing stuff
[2015-08-10 07:25:37] WhereIsMySpoon: that is not the id for your search box :S
[2015-08-10 07:25:47] WhereIsMySpoon: <input type="text" id="SearchQuery" name="SearchQuery" placeholder="Quotes, Keywords, Products, News, etc." onkeypress="CallSearchButtonCommand(event)">
[2015-08-10 07:25:55] sgsabbage: in part because appium and the iOS simulator doesn't really seem to get allong that much
[2015-08-10 07:26:19] dude-x: sgsabbage: how does xcode 7 improve app testing?
[2015-08-10 07:26:33] dude-x: i've heard improvements but no specifics
[2015-08-10 07:26:35] sgsabbage: long answer https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=406
[2015-08-10 07:27:01] sgsabbage: shorter answer 1: http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/xcode-7-ui-testing/
[2015-08-10 07:27:02] sgsabbage: etc
[2015-08-10 07:27:29] optionsbob: i had the wrong id... got it working
[2015-08-10 07:27:32] sgsabbage: as I understand it it's still not perfect
[2015-08-10 07:27:35] sgsabbage: but getting there
[2015-08-10 07:28:12] dude-x: sgsabbage: i hope appium adopts to xcode 7 interface!
[2015-08-10 07:28:26] sgsabbage: dude-x: that will depend very much on Apple, I think

[2015-08-10 09:53:53] Dave_B_: I mean even if they only had a few options (album by date, reverse of this, random) that'd be OK I guess
[2015-08-10 09:55:01] sircapsalot: another annoyance is screenshots.  to take a screenshot, you need to hold power, and volume-up.  fine.. that way you could do it with one hand.  problem isâ€¦ with the lumia 920.. (http://www.mobiles4sale.in/pictures/default/nokia-lumia-920/nokia-lumia-920-pic-8.jpg)  you can't easily press the volume-up when holding your thumb on the power button
[2015-08-10 09:55:36] sircapsalot: it's too far.  AND, there is a timer. so when yo ufinally line up your thumb properly, the timer has passed, and it just volume-up's

[2015-08-10 11:25:13] steminist: octomeow would you suggest having another wait command after I sendkeys(username)
[2015-08-10 11:26:46] steminist: even if i implictly_wait(5) after every command i am still not getting it to correctly login
[2015-08-10 11:27:10] steminist: the url will open up and then i get my warning as if i pressed login before submitting a username and then the browser closes
[2015-08-10 11:27:57] dude-x: steminist: add a time.sleep(3) before the login
[2015-08-10 11:28:15] dude-x: you can set implicitly wait to infinity and it would still fail in some cases
[2015-08-10 11:31:51] steminist: i get this error:     time.sleep(5) NameError: global name 'time' is not defined

[2015-08-10 11:33:14] dude-x: lukeis: for your mobile tests, do you tap before you type/send_keys?
[2015-08-10 11:33:35] dude-x: steminist: yes, if you're looking at the browser run, you should see the username show up in the text field.
[2015-08-10 11:33:41] steminist: hmm ok '
[2015-08-10 11:33:50] lukeis: dude-x: i don't explicitlyâ€¦ most of the frameworks do so implicitly
[2015-08-10 11:33:54] steminist: i do not see it showing up in the text field
[2015-08-10 11:34:09] steminist:         driver.find_element_by_id("userName").send_keys("name_lastname")
[2015-08-10 11:34:21] steminist: is this not the best way to do this?
[2015-08-10 11:34:49] dude-x: lukeis: occasionally i get errors when attempting to type. do you do a visiblity check for the field or some other sync move?
[2015-08-10 11:35:32] steminist: I fixed it dude-x
[2015-08-10 11:35:34] steminist: thank you

[2015-08-10 11:40:10] steminist: is there any way to make sure that the webpage aftetr the login stays open so that scrapy can scrape it
[2015-08-10 11:40:26] steminist: right now i am calling driver.close() because im not sure when scraping will begin
[2015-08-10 11:41:22] dude-x: steminist: i believe you can extract the cookies and pass that to scrapy?
[2015-08-10 11:41:54] dude-x: but if the web app has sophisticated session tracking that may not work
[2015-08-10 11:45:55] steminist: oh but you could no do it in the driver
[2015-08-10 11:47:13] dude-x: you can leave the browser open if you want.

[2015-08-10 12:20:45] steminist: how can i make it so that the response passed from selenium contains the next page's url
[2015-08-10 12:21:07] steminist: so instead of http://website.com/login i want http://website.com/mainpage

[2015-08-10 12:22:05] steminist: im not sure how to do that
[2015-08-10 12:22:28] steminist: because the http://website.com/mainpage redirects to the login page unless you authenticate it through the webdriver
[2015-08-10 12:23:04] jimevans: well, i don't know anything about scrapy, but i presume there's some scrapy method you call to actually do whatever it is you need that library to do on the page, no?

[2015-08-10 12:27:42] AutomatedTester: even though I have been spoken about in pycon talks
[2015-08-10 12:28:12] jimevans: steminist: so the question is, what cookies are you receiving from the driver? do they include the cookies required to bypass the login screen and navigate directly to the page you're interested in?
[2015-08-10 12:28:25] steminist: hmm
[2015-08-10 12:28:40] steminist: so i thought that i could just login with selenium and scrape then and there
[2015-08-10 12:28:47] steminist: but i guess i have to pass the cookies in somewhere
[2015-08-10 12:28:55] jimevans: because once your call to get_some_cookies is done returns, selenium is out of the picture.
[2015-08-10 12:29:16] steminist: oh!

[2015-08-10 12:29:18] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-10 12:29:20] jimevans: your code does pass those cookies retrieved by webdriver into the Request.
[2015-08-10 12:29:32] steminist: so somehow i have to pass the cookies i got from selenium?
[2015-08-10 12:29:42] jimevans: you're doing that. that's what i'm trying to tell you.
[2015-08-10 12:30:16] jimevans: look at what your code is trying to do.
[2015-08-10 12:30:39] steminist: somehow i have to do something with the cookies i got from scrapy
[2015-08-10 12:30:41] steminist: correct?
[2015-08-10 12:30:49] steminist: got from selenium*
[2015-08-10 12:31:14] steminist: i need to take those cookies and let scrapy know that i have them so that scrapy can enter that session and scrape the authenticated page?
[2015-08-10 12:31:36] jimevans: i suspect so. again, i don't know scrapy, so i'm flying a little blind. but it looks like you're already attempting to do exactly that.
[2015-08-10 12:23:43] jimevans: what method do you call on MySpider to start the whole scraping process? parse()?
[2015-08-10 12:25:01] jimevans: and actually, once you have the session cookies (if they're accessible to webdriver; they may not be), you probably wouldn't have to re-login with scrapy
[2015-08-10 12:25:33] steminist: so i was thinking of just taking the cookies not reloggin in
[2015-08-10 12:26:01] steminist: this is where i got my inspiration though ive changed some of the code http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11200926/scrapy-authentication-login-with-cookies

[2015-08-10 12:29:43] jimevans: steminist: depends on the app design, but you might be able to go directly to http://website.com/mainpage if you have the proper authentication cookies. might is the key word there.
[2015-08-10 12:30:02] jimevans: you really need to debug the cookies you're getting back from webdriver.
[2015-08-10 12:31:31] jimevans: and would have to know, i mean absolutely *know*, that the cookies you need to define the session are present in the request you're sending to the authenticated URL.
[2015-08-10 12:31:49] steminist: is there script you need to write to debug the cookies
[2015-08-10 12:32:06] dude-x: wait did i just see a wheels package uploaded?
[2015-08-10 12:32:06] steminist: so you need to make sure youre passing in the right cookies to the website? before you can begin scraping
[2015-08-10 12:32:28] AutomatedTester: dude-x: yup
[2015-08-10 12:32:31] jimevans: steminist: you're already doing that. you're printing the value of cookies in get_some_cookies(). are you passing the correct cookies?
[2015-08-10 12:32:47] dude-x: AutomatedTester: you know maybe we should use twine, since setup.py passes your pypi password in cleartext
[2015-08-10 12:33:07] dude-x:  or rather distutils/setuptools
[2015-08-10 12:33:10] AutomatedTester: dude-x: only if you use <2.7.9
[2015-08-10 12:33:17] dude-x: oh that was fixed?
[2015-08-10 12:33:25] AutomatedTester: yea, we just had this discussion

[2015-08-10 12:33:30] AutomatedTester: in my team channel
[2015-08-10 12:33:33] jimevans: but yes, you need to know if the authentication tokens you're passing (if any, and they are passed via cookies) are the correct ones.
[2015-08-10 12:33:41] *AutomatedTester finds the point '
[2015-08-10 12:34:07] AutomatedTester: dude-x: https://github.com/pypa/twine#why-should-i-use-this
[2015-08-10 12:34:26] steminist: are authentication tokens different than cookies?
[2015-08-10 12:35:01] jimevans: steminist: that's a different question, and highly, highly dependent on what the app itself is doing. i cannot give you a blanket, one-size-fits-all answer.

[2015-08-10 12:35:37] jimevans: many, many websites do pass their authentication information back and forth to the browser via cookies.

[2015-08-10 12:38:36] dude-x: A place called handy.com
[2015-08-10 12:38:47] jimevans: steminist: you've provided no information about how the website you're targeting actually does its security, so vague ideas about what might work is all i can give you. but yes, if the authentication cookie is present in the actual http traffic that you can see via a proxy, and it's present in the cookies returned by webdriver, it's likely you're on the right track.
[2015-08-10 12:39:01] AutomatedTester: dude-x: that's... handy

[2015-08-10 12:51:59] steminist: as in if the driver sees this element on the page, i know it is the right page and then i call get_cookies
[2015-08-10 12:52:34] jimevans: steminist: well, yes, but i'd just use webdriverwait, and call it a day.
[2015-08-10 12:52:50] steminist: sorry what is that

[2015-08-10 13:26:25] jimevans: then how do you know it "doesn't change"? i would presume that when you go through the login process, you'd get a new session.
[2015-08-10 13:26:44] steminist: the PHPSESSID does not change once you're inside the main page
[2015-08-10 13:26:52] jimevans: no, it shouldn't.
[2015-08-10 13:27:16] steminist: but it does change when its on the login page

[2015-08-10 13:27:52] jimevans: (to be pedantic and clear about the sequence of events)
[2015-08-10 13:28:11] steminist: so i am using firebug to look at the cookies on each page

[2015-08-10 13:39:43] jason12459: How can I volunteer to help test Selenium 3?
[2015-08-10 13:42:25] jimevans: jason12459: let me answer that question by asking one: what do you anticipate "selenium 3" to be?
[2015-08-10 13:44:05] jason12459: Selenium 3 is supposed to be geared towards Mobile apps (please correct me if I am wrong)
[2015-08-10 13:45:22] jimevans: jason12459: actually, the selenium project itself has, and likely will have, no direct support of automating "mobile apps," if by that, you mean ability to directly automate android or ios or windows mobile applications.
[2015-08-10 13:45:50] jimevans: there are lots of companion projects that use the webdriver api, and are far better suited to that purpose.
[2015-08-10 13:46:20] jimevans: i'm thinking specifically of selendroid for android, ios-driver for ios applications, appium for both android and ios, and so on.
[2015-08-10 13:46:24] AutomatedTester: (which could fall under the wider project if they wanted to)
[2015-08-10 13:47:02] jason12459: Sorry I am a bit confused ... so Selenium 3 is not "a tool for user-focused automation of mobile and web app"?
[2015-08-10 13:47:16] jimevans: AutomatedTester: well, appium might have a tough time with that, since it's part of the node foundation and all...
[2015-08-10 13:47:48] AutomatedTester: jimevans: hence the "if they wanted to"
[2015-08-10 13:48:00] AutomatedTester: I would chalk that up as "they dont want to"
[2015-08-10 13:48:14] jimevans: jason12459: if that's a direct quote from our documentation, it needs to be changed.
[2015-08-10 13:48:26] jason12459: its from here: https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/the-road-to-selenium-3/
[2015-08-10 13:48:45] jimevans: oh, the blog post that's approaching 2 years old now. i see.
[2015-08-10 13:48:56] jason12459: its the first thing that comes up when i google selenium 3
[2015-08-10 13:49:35] jason12459: Jim do you have something more official that I could read?
[2015-08-10 13:50:10] jimevans: jason12459: nope. and i'm not gonna get dragged into a discussion about it either.
[2015-08-10 13:50:33] jason12459: very sorry, not trying to cause problems just trying to get the facts straight
[2015-08-10 13:51:24] jimevans: basically, from the point of view of the selenium project proper, "selenium 3" is mostly "removing selenium rc into a separate download for java users"
[2015-08-10 13:51:57] jimevans: simonstewart can step in and comment anytime, of course. :)
[2015-08-10 13:52:29] *simonstewart wonders what I should be stepping into'
[2015-08-10 13:53:18] jimevans: simonstewart: just make sure i'm not grossly misrepresenting anything re: "selenium 3"
[2015-08-10 13:53:22] titusfortner: Actually, I've been meaning to ask. What does it mean for other bindings? Are we moving RC code elsewhere? Or deleting it? Or leaving it alone? I'm actually not very familiar with RC things, because I've never really used it. :)
[2015-08-10 13:53:31] simonstewart: selenium 3 is "no more rc" for any language, but the major piece of work is ripping out the old RC server from the java code
[2015-08-10 13:53:41] simonstewart: selenium 4 is the w3c compliant version
[2015-08-10 13:54:03] simonstewart: For java, we handle it by adding a "leg-rc.jar"
[2015-08-10 13:54:14] simonstewart: That provides the old APIs and the server, but frozen
[2015-08-10 13:54:25] simonstewart: .Net may do something similar
[2015-08-10 13:54:38] titusfortner: And for other bindings it is "use Selenium 2 if you still want it" ?
[2015-08-10 13:54:44] simonstewart: Python and Ruby will probably need a separate library
[2015-08-10 13:54:59] simonstewart: With the understanding that RC will be unsupported
[2015-08-10 13:55:54] titusfortner: So, we wouldn't be fixing anything that breaks with new browsers? (assuming that happens now)
[2015-08-10 13:56:59] steminist: jimevans: thanks
[2015-08-10 13:57:18] jimevans: steminist: did you get things working?
[2015-08-10 13:57:45] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: what's left to do for leg-rc?
[2015-08-10 13:57:55] jason12459: Saying that the main focus is Removing the RC is less sexy than saying this new version is going to focus on Mobile apps   :-)   but I will look into Appium (and maybe the other 2) as far as mobile testing goes...thank you Jim
[2015-08-10 13:58:05] simonstewart: Ripping out the old RC server and removing any remaining deps
[2015-08-10 13:58:25] simonstewart: jason12459: the mobile webdriver spec is based on the webdriver APIs
[2015-08-10 13:58:36] simonstewart: So we're making that more lightweight :)
[2015-08-10 13:59:56] jason12459: ohhh ok, interesting, Thank you Simonstewart.  Do you know anywhere, that I can read more about Selenium 3 that is accurate?
[2015-08-10 14:00:16] simonstewart: SeConf '15 :)
[2015-08-10 14:00:55] steminist: no :/
[2015-08-10 14:01:03] steminist: i guess i need to understand my cookies more
[2015-08-10 14:02:11] jason12459: SeConf 2015 is comming up next month.  I will read more about it after that.  Thanks Simon
[2015-08-10 14:02:53] jimevans: steminist: also, bear in mind that the format the cookies are returned in from webdriver may not be the format that scrapy expects them to be in. i have no idea about that; you'll have to research the scrapy api yourself.
