[2015-08-20 10:29:13] errant_rider, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-20 10:29:24] dude-x: AnConio: you have to switch frames to operate with iframes or frames
[2015-08-20 10:29:31] jimevans: AnConio: that's a pretty broad question, was my point.
[2015-08-20 10:29:51] AnConio: really, I just panicked the minute I saw an iframe...I cringed thinking I needed to do some sort of "switch to" and then a findBy to be able to enter actual text
[2015-08-20 10:30:53] AnConio: okay, now confused...right now I just basically typed some text into the box by finding the iframe element....w/o having to do any further finding by inside of that or doing a "switch to"

[2015-08-20 12:37:55] titusfortner: Marionette is more w3c compliant than json wire protocol right?
[2015-08-20 12:38:00] AutomatedTester: yes
[2015-08-20 12:38:18] titusfortner: yeah, it's on my list to work on, if only work wasn't doing a big release right around the selenium conference
[2015-08-20 12:38:24] jimevans: titusfortner: the two dialects of the protocol are fundamentally incompatible.
[2015-08-20 12:38:34] AutomatedTester: that reminds me...
[2015-08-20 12:38:38] titusfortner: yeah, I noticed with some of the edge implementations

[2015-08-20 12:40:38] titusfortner: I'm guessing that's because w3c hasn't specified some of those things yet?
[2015-08-20 12:40:46] jimevans: that's a little misleading.
[2015-08-20 12:40:53] AutomatedTester: yea, their page is wrong

[2015-08-20 12:41:59] titusfortner: How are other bindings handling the switch to w3c approach? Toggling by browser/version somehow?

[2015-08-20 12:43:56] jimevans: titusfortner: you examine the payload you get back from the first "new session" command. if it's an OSS dialect response, use the OSS dialect. if it's a w3c dialect response, use the w3c dialect. though, as AutomatedTester just said, he's adding a capability you can check in the returned capabilities.
[2015-08-20 12:44:17] titusfortner: score
[2015-08-20 12:44:27] AutomatedTester: examining payloads can be misleading
[2015-08-20 12:44:29] AutomatedTester: just saying
[2015-08-20 12:44:47] AutomatedTester: getting something concrete will be better
[2015-08-20 12:44:58] titusfortner: Do we know what Google's plans are for switching to w3c?
[2015-08-20 12:45:03] jimevans: yes, it can. which is why i'm utterly opposed to attempting to do it.
[2015-08-20 12:45:13] jimevans: and proposed the capability in the first place.
[2015-08-20 12:45:47] jimevans: titusfortner: no idea. joshbruning? juangj?
[2015-08-20 12:46:23] jimevans: at some point MSFT will "flip the switch" on the edge driver.
[2015-08-20 12:46:29] AutomatedTester: Sam would be the best person to ask
[2015-08-20 12:46:37] AutomatedTester: and I owe him an email so will ask
[2015-08-20 12:46:53] titusfortner: Some of the Edge things don't work now because it isn't wire protocol compatible
[2015-08-20 12:47:01] titusfortner: I think window switching used a different parameter
[2015-08-20 12:47:03] AutomatedTester: he is the person that hit me right in the feels last night
[2015-08-20 12:47:16] jimevans: titusfortner: no, some of the edge things don't work because they're just not flamin' implemented.
[2015-08-20 12:47:23] titusfortner: well, that too
[2015-08-20 12:47:36] titusfortner: changing windows works, but I have to change the implementation that works for the other browsers
[2015-08-20 12:48:07] jimevans: according to their status page, switching windows isn't ready yet.
[2015-08-20 12:49:43] titusfortner: Oh, hmm. I'm almost certain that was the setting that I got to work, but had to change back because it broke the other browsers... but... this was 3 weeks ago, and I've slept since then...

[2015-08-20 13:36:52] titusfortner: lukeis: You're using Travis for your Python tests, right? Any reason I shouldn't add a circle.yml to run the Ruby tests? Do you have yours set to run every commit?
[2015-08-20 13:37:54] lukeis: titusfortner: no reason you couldn't (although i must admit i don't know what the circle.yml is)… python "checks" to see if it should run the tests on every pull request… take a look at the travis.yml
[2015-08-20 13:39:09] titusfortner: It's another cloud CI that supports UI tests. Also free for open source. I've been testing it out with a fork
[2015-08-20 13:39:14] titusfortner: Travis doesn't allow multiple languages
[2015-08-20 13:39:51] lukeis: don't allow? meh… things are installed ;)
[2015-08-20 13:40:19] titusfortner: I mean, python tests and ruby tests don't run together
[2015-08-20 13:41:01] titusfortner: I don't fully understand all the settings jarib set up for the watir-webdriver tests, but he has travis download chrome and do a bunch of things before running
[2015-08-20 13:41:01] lukeis: that's just another 'go' target though, right?

[2015-08-20 13:41:49] titusfortner: yeah, and I know the watir-webdriver tests were flaky with phantom
[2015-08-20 13:41:52] titusfortner: we've been running Firefox & Chrome

[2015-08-20 13:42:25] lukeis: yay ;)
[2015-08-20 13:42:48] lukeis: i think i saw someone try to report that on the seleniumhq github issues...
[2015-08-20 13:43:01] lukeis: closed it because there was an extreme lack of information :)

[2015-08-20 13:47:56] lukeis: not sure I think the bug is high priority… click isn't guaranteed to wait for the action… although it certainly should be able to if theres an onclick that immediately opens an alert dialog :)
[2015-08-20 13:48:05] lukeis: always be waiting :)
[2015-08-20 13:49:06] lukeis: the other one i saw was actually related to IE it seems #949

[2015-08-20 13:53:32] dude-x: i tried .scrollViews().staticText(s)
[2015-08-20 13:53:37] dude-x: i tried .scrollViews().staticTexts()
[2015-08-20 13:54:14] dude-x: i am thinking maybe after scrollViews I have to select a specific element then I can call scrollviews
[2015-08-20 13:54:16] lukeis: hmmm, i try not to use UIA directly anymore and haven't in a long time :)
[2015-08-20 13:54:23] dude-x: :sad trombone: :(
[2015-08-20 13:54:34] lukeis: are you using appium? or straight UIA?
[2015-08-20 13:54:40] dude-x: appium
[2015-08-20 13:55:01] lukeis: and you can't find it by link text?
[2015-08-20 13:55:24] lukeis: or by tag name… or … or… :)
[2015-08-20 13:55:35] dude-x: ooh tag name
[2015-08-20 13:55:37] dude-x: that can work...

[2015-08-20 13:57:14] dhoer: I was thinking about moving out chrome driver and ie driver server from chef-selenium cookbook to be there own cookbook that would self register to selenium.  I would think dropping a file with .driver extension under $selenium_home/drivers would work.  I think that driver file would contain name= and arg= where name would be name of the driver 'chromedriver' and args would be what is appended to standalone.jar when starting it.  Does
[2015-08-20 13:58:07] dhoer: This came about, because users building there custom drivers for jxbrower and the like to handle java being removed from chrome.
