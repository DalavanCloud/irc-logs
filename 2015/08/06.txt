[2015-08-06 03:41:05] philippk2: Hi, one question... from the latest selenium changelog:  "* Added TakesScreenshot to WebElement." - Is this already implemented by chromedriver or the firefoxdriver?
[2015-08-06 03:42:02] WizJin, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-06 03:43:35] sgsabbage: I don't believe so - in the .NET changelog: "Added ITakesScreenshot to .NET RemoteWebElement for spec compatibility Note that no driver implements this at present, so attempting to use this within any test will result in a NotImplementedException."
[2015-08-06 03:44:47] philippk2: ok.. thanks, that is what i'm seeing :)
[2015-08-06 03:45:32] sgsabbage: my very basic understanding is that it's for compliance with the w3c spec for webdriver (http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) which isn't currently in use, but is being developed towards
[2015-08-06 03:46:07] sgsabbage: I think, anyway.
[2015-08-06 03:47:29] philippk2: Makes sense. I guess I was a little bit too fast. From reading the changelog I thought it is already implemented
[2015-08-06 03:54:26] pauluchon: Do you have a workaround for hovering an element with Chrome Driver ? I'm a little bit stuck here.. I tried to perform a mousemove on the element but it doesn't last enough..

[2015-08-06 04:02:52] sgsabbage: pauluchon: What's the use case - as in, what are you trying to get? Text to display, or to click on a menu that appears when you hover, etc?
[2015-08-06 04:03:02] sgsabbage: also, which of the three billion bindings are you using?
[2015-08-06 04:03:16] pauluchon: A click on a menu..
[2015-08-06 04:03:22] sgsabbage: facebook, element 34, instaclick, selenium2testcase for phpunit?
[2015-08-06 04:03:33] sgsabbage: I'm sure there's more
[2015-08-06 04:03:39] pauluchon: And I'm using the phpunit bindings
[2015-08-06 04:03:58] sgsabbage: kk - when you say mousemove, how did you achieve that?
[2015-08-06 04:04:41] pauluchon: get my element with css and a call to moveTo() function
[2015-08-06 04:05:13] sgsabbage: hmm - is there anything else going on at the same time on the machine
[2015-08-06 04:05:32] sgsabbage: as in, are you running your tests in the background while you work, or are they dedicated?
[2015-08-06 04:05:52] pauluchon: No, but I think the problem appear when my mouse pointer is on the screen
[2015-08-06 04:06:39] pauluchon: They dedicated
[2015-08-06 04:06:42] sgsabbage: what's the environment?
[2015-08-06 04:06:51] pauluchon: Windows 7
[2015-08-06 04:07:00] pauluchon: Last chrome version
[2015-08-06 04:07:16] pauluchon: And I control with the remote desktop
[2015-08-06 04:08:13] sgsabbage: hm, starting to delve into the realms of personal experience rather than anything concrete - is the machine always on, or is it a VM created specifically just before you test?
[2015-08-06 04:08:30] pauluchon: Machine always on
[2015-08-06 04:08:50] pauluchon: And thank's for sharing your experience ;)
[2015-08-06 04:10:19] sgsabbage: hm, I know I've seen issues where if I'm RDed into a VM while a test is going on, it does occasionally cause mouse issues
[2015-08-06 04:10:46] sgsabbage: and in one completely weird experience, if I don't RD into my VMs after they've booted, clicking doesn't work
[2015-08-06 04:13:45] pauluchon: Problem happens when i'm RD and when i'm not
[2015-08-06 04:14:16] sgsabbage: hm, damn
[2015-08-06 04:14:21] pauluchon: But only with Chrome
[2015-08-06 04:14:28] pauluchon: Yeah, you said it
[2015-08-06 04:14:49] pauluchon: I'm trying again without RD
[2015-08-06 04:15:27] pauluchon: No same issue
[2015-08-06 04:15:40] pauluchon: I'm going to use js I think
[2015-08-06 04:16:09] sgsabbage: I'll be honest it does sound more like a chromedriver or chrome problem - I do very little with hovers because ugh hover. Yeah, that was my next suggestion, trigger the hover with execute()
[2015-08-06 04:16:16] sgsabbage: beyond that, sorry I can't be of more help
[2015-08-06 04:16:35] pauluchon: Don't be sorry, thank's for helping me
[2015-08-06 04:16:39] sgsabbage: WhereIsMySpoon: See, it's not always PHP
[2015-08-06 04:16:44] sgsabbage: (but it usually is)
[2015-08-06 04:17:00] pauluchon: Hover are such a pain..
[2015-08-06 04:17:12] pauluchon: Next step is drag'n'drop

[2015-08-06 05:33:15] WhereIsMySpoon: much more important to create more bindings
[2015-08-06 05:34:06] pauluchon: I think there is enough bindings.. It would be better with one official..

[2015-08-06 05:34:46] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-08-06 05:34:46] pauluchon: ^^
[2015-08-06 05:35:31] sgsabbage: oh, looking at it, as far as I can see all it does is call /session/:sessionId/moveto
[2015-08-06 05:35:38] sgsabbage: which is all that moveTo() in Selenium2TestCase.php does
[2015-08-06 05:37:35] sgsabbage: most of the PHP bindings that I've seen tend to be very thin wrappers over the wire protocol, whereas Java seems to have far more helpers
[2015-08-06 05:37:59] sgsabbage: the PHP bindings are just less intuitive
[2015-08-06 05:38:11] pauluchon: There a case where I can trigger the hover event and perform a click using the moveto()
[2015-08-06 05:38:30] pauluchon: But it fails "sometimes"...

[2015-08-06 05:41:54] sgsabbage: ouch
[2015-08-06 05:43:23] sgsabbage: the problem with 'official' PHP bindings as I see it is that there are already so many bindings out there, someone either has to write another set and contribute them to SeleniumHQ - which has the problem of then introducing yet another set of bindings. Or, one of the ones already out there would need to be contributed to Selenium under the CLA. Probably the best set out there (ironically, not the ones I use) are Facebook's, but I bet they wouldn't c

[2015-08-06 11:06:10] jleyba: mekhami: not at all likely that selenium will ever offer that out of the box. you can use css selectors
[2015-08-06 11:06:38] sircapsalot: ^
[2015-08-06 11:06:41] andrewmkrug: does anyone keep the entire automated test suite in the same repo as the project?
[2015-08-06 11:06:48] mekhami: using css selectors sucks equally as much
[2015-08-06 11:06:59] sircapsalot: that'd be a bad move, andrewmkrug.
[2015-08-06 11:07:02] mekhami: and apparently there's some front end trend to use data-attributes over ids for linkability or whatever
[2015-08-06 11:07:06] mekhami: sircapsalot: why?
[2015-08-06 11:08:34] sircapsalot: he's asking if people clone selenium, then create their own project inside of the selenium source code.  in my humble opinion, that's not the best move.  that's why there are artifacts

[2015-08-06 11:09:40] jleyba: mekhami, how does using css suck equally as much?  By.css("article[data-columns='3']")
[2015-08-06 11:09:41] andrewmkrug: no i mean as i have all of the selenium testcases in the same repo as the product that it run against
[2015-08-06 11:10:06] jleyba: how would you simplify that in a way that justifies adding complexity to the selenium api?
[2015-08-06 11:10:07] sircapsalot: ohhhh :)  sorry.. my bad. yes that's perfectly ok to do
[2015-08-06 11:10:19] mekhami: jleyba: i mean that's the simplest case but i don't have the easiest dom to work with
[2015-08-06 11:10:26] sircapsalot: "the project" was extremely vague
[2015-08-06 11:10:59] jleyba: mekhami, build a library on top of selenium that translates w/e you want to use into css selectos
[2015-08-06 11:11:09] andrewmkrug: management wants it in the same repo so that the devs can easily add to it as well as qa in theory
[2015-08-06 11:11:30] mekhami: andrewmkrug: i do that  with a large project at a large company (70+ devs)
[2015-08-06 11:11:50] jleyba: andrewmkrug, we use one massive repo and it works fine

[2015-08-06 11:17:52] titusfortner: I believe data-attributes are best practice. Especially since for some reusable code you can end up with more than one of the same ID in the DOM.
[2015-08-06 11:19:14] titusfortner: Watir supports data attributes directly, but in that respect it is mostly an xpath translation
