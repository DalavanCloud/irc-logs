[2015-08-27 03:58:29] GforOevOerD: What can I do to switch the control flow of webdriver.get to the next statement as the page is loading?
[2015-08-27 04:02:35] WhereIsMySpoon: GforOevOerD: you cant unless you only use firefox

[2015-08-27 04:02:53] WhereIsMySpoon: then try that
[2015-08-27 04:02:53] GforOevOerD: WhereIsMySpoon I use firefox
[2015-08-27 04:03:41] WhereIsMySpoon: note i said "try" not "it will work 100% thats ur solution"

[2015-08-27 04:07:33] GforOevOerD: WhereIsMySpoon I am testing a website with my selenium bot and I am using firefox driver. Since the website has a lot of external sources other than dom, it takes centuries to get all of them loaded.
[2015-08-27 04:08:13] GforOevOerD: WhereIsMySpoon Now I am sure that the method you gave would work nicely.

[2015-08-27 06:48:56] Alex11223: How to wait until one of the elements exist?
[2015-08-27 06:48:56] Alex11223: I mean something like wait.Until(d => d.FindElementByXpath(errorXpath) || d.FindElementByXpath(successXpath));
[2015-08-27 06:48:56] Alex11223: As I understand FindElement* throws exception if not found, so this will not work.
[2015-08-27 06:49:32] jimevans: Alex11223: except that WebDriverWait catches NoSuchElementExceptions while polling for the element.
[2015-08-27 06:49:50] jimevans: though you really can't use a logical 'or' with those
[2015-08-27 06:49:55] Alex11223: yeah, but it will never reach the second part of the condition
[2015-08-27 06:50:41] jimevans: okay, so use FindElements instead and check for Count > 0
[2015-08-27 06:51:13] Alex11223: yeah, that's exactly what I did, thought there is a better way
[2015-08-27 06:51:49] jimevans: i'd write out the method as more than a one-liner, but that's just me.

[2015-08-27 06:53:22] tony2, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-27 06:53:29] Alex11223: the problem is that it takes too long time and I don't understand why. The PollingInterval is default 500 ms but it often waits 5-10 seconds after the element is visible
[2015-08-27 06:54:02] jimevans: Alex11223: do you set an implicit wait timeout anywhere? if so, don't.
[2015-08-27 06:55:37] jimevans: rcp: not sure exactly what you mean, but if this is about sponsorship, you won't get a lot of help in this channel
[2015-08-27 06:56:02] rcp: how can I contact some of the official people
[2015-08-27 06:56:11] rcp: hardly any contact info on the site apart from here
[2015-08-27 06:56:28] jimevans: email is the only way, really. sponsorship stuff is all handled through the SFC
[2015-08-27 06:57:43] rcp: ok
[2015-08-27 06:57:44] rcp: thanks

[2015-08-27 14:31:37] jleyba: working on this closure update. the compiler is finding some legit issues
[2015-08-27 14:31:51] titusfortner: is the idea to use current firefox implementation if they are using a browser before this version, and marionette if after?
[2015-08-27 14:31:59] AutomatedTester: yes
[2015-08-27 14:32:10] jleyba: there are chunks of code in the current firefox driver that should not work

[2015-08-27 14:34:51] AutomatedTester: specificationLevel
[2015-08-27 14:35:11] jimevans: titusfortner: the idea is that specificationLevel will be returned in the capabilities passed back from a new session. a value of 0 or nonexistent means "speak the open-source dialect"
[2015-08-27 14:35:32] titusfortner: awesome, thanks for breaking that down for me
[2015-08-27 14:36:00] jimevans: at least, that's how i envisioned it when i proposed the specificationLevel capability.
[2015-08-27 14:36:46] yenaemj, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-27 14:37:18] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the spec won't describe what to do with it

[2015-08-27 14:38:31] AutomatedTester: I am about to push my patch with specificationLevel
[2015-08-27 14:39:58] titusfortner: I wish I didn't have so much on my plate right now, I'm excited to get this working. :)
[2015-08-27 14:40:28] *AutomatedTester wishes he had 30 hour days'
[2015-08-27 14:40:56] titusfortner: Oh, wait, does this mean the driver is inside the browser, and I don't need a separate executable?
[2015-08-27 14:41:36] jimevans: titusfortner: it *is* inside the browser, but if you want to do the minimal amount of work, use the separate executable. :)
[2015-08-27 14:42:19] titusfortner: why is that less work? :)
[2015-08-27 14:43:24] jleyba: shouldn't spec level be checked *before* spending resources to create a browser session?
[2015-08-27 14:43:25] *AutomatedTester drinks more wine...'
[2015-08-27 14:43:26] jimevans: because the stuff you'd have to poke down a socket to marionette is not the same as that used over http. you *could* do it, you'd just have to implement a whole different protocol handler. just like you *could* implement the chrome driver by sending remote debugging protocol messages down a websocket
[2015-08-27 14:43:54] jimevans: jleyba: if only that were possible.
[2015-08-27 14:44:16] AutomatedTester: jleyba: so I added a "marionette" capability to python
[2015-08-27 14:44:23] AutomatedTester: if you want the new way you update
[2015-08-27 14:44:38] AutomatedTester: if not it uses the old way

[2015-08-27 14:45:13] jleyba: jimevans, simon's word is not law
[2015-08-27 14:45:21] jleyba: selenium 3.0 still hasn't shipped
[2015-08-27 14:45:25] titusfortner: So person with version Firefox vXX+ will get an error when they try to use Firefox that they need to download the driver executable?
[2015-08-27 14:45:27] jleyba: so we could just all vote to break compat at that point
[2015-08-27 14:46:16] jimevans: jleyba: and i'd probably vote that way, even as user-unfriendly as it is.
[2015-08-27 14:46:34] jimevans: (which is the major argument for not just doing it)

[2015-08-27 14:48:22] jimevans: jleyba: a major version number release every six weeks? yeah, that greatly dilutes the meaning of "major numbers in version numbers"
[2015-08-27 14:48:24] AutomatedTester: all the millenials use it
[2015-08-27 14:48:51] AutomatedTester: jimevans: both google and Mozilla ship minor versions between those times too

[2015-08-27 14:49:21] jleyba: jimevans, major version is a completely arbitrary concept. as long as it's consistent for the product using the versioning

This is most probably due to the fact that Grid Extras is calling "shutdown -r now" without sudo, so it's given "shutdown: Need to be root" error". Just wondering how you guys are setting up your node so that you guys are running shutdown without sudo. maybe smccarthy can give me some insights as he's worked on the rebooting component in Grid Extras
[2015-08-27 15:11:33] smccarthy: ET1: Sorry I don't remember. Most of my testing is on Windows nodes. Maybe its expecting you to run with sudo priveledges ?

[2015-08-27 15:15:26] ET1: smccarthy: It's definitely asking me to run with sudo when I'm using a normal user. I'm not too fond of running my tests as root because of security reasons, so I just want to know how others are doing to get some insights.
[2015-08-27 15:16:14] ET1: I mean I can open a PR to modify the reboot command to use sudo, but I'm not sure how that would affect other people who also use Grid Extras

[2015-08-27 17:03:51] bristo: hey Guys, I am trying to use Selenium RC using official selenium docker-hub and node-firefox image. The tests run fine but when I attempt to capture a screenshot of some scenario, I get a “java.awt.AWTException: headless environment” exception on node-firefox console. AFAICT the node-firefox is running using Xvfb. What am I missing ?
[2015-08-27 17:05:08] bristo: These are the images I am using: https://hub.docker.com/r/selenium/hub/ and https://hub.docker.com/r/selenium/node-firefox/
