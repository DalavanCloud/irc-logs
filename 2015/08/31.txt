[2015-08-31 03:13:14] prohobo: tools_: what do you mean?
[2015-08-31 03:13:26] prohobo: i just call driver = webdriver.Chrome()
[2015-08-31 03:13:51] tools_: how do you load the chrome driver binary
[2015-08-31 03:14:56] prohobo: i dont know
[2015-08-31 03:15:19] prohobo: i just installed selenium and the ChromeDriver, then created the python script
[2015-08-31 03:15:22] prohobo: :\
[2015-08-31 03:16:55] prohobo: i suppose i have to setup a symlink from /usr/bin/google-chrome?
[2015-08-31 03:17:14] tools_: Okay the script is all most correct actually. Though you need to load the ChromeDriver binary and telle the webdriver.Chrome(), which webdriver binary (in your case chrome) it should use. Here is the correct one
[2015-08-31 03:17:15] tools_: https://gist.github.com/looopTools/0e57472dc2129631207d
[2015-08-31 03:17:34] tools_: the symlink depends on the OS, fedora for instance creates it as standard
[2015-08-31 03:17:57] tools_: you will need to download this https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home
[2015-08-31 03:19:45] prohobo: okay
[2015-08-31 03:19:47] prohobo: i have it installed
[2015-08-31 03:19:57] prohobo: i created the symlinks for chromedriver itself as well
[2015-08-31 03:20:57] prohobo: still just sits there when i execute
[2015-08-31 03:21:19] prohobo: oh wait
[2015-08-31 03:21:47] prohobo: okay ty, now im just getting "selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: 'chromedriver' executable needs to be in PATH."
[2015-08-31 03:22:46] tools_: move the binary to the same path as the python script
[2015-08-31 03:26:33] prohobo: weird
[2015-08-31 03:26:36] prohobo: doesn't change anything
[2015-08-31 03:26:59] prohobo: also changing the path to /usr/local/share/ (where the chromedriver executable is) doesn't change anything either
[2015-08-31 03:27:06] prohobo: executing the file thru terminal works fine
[2015-08-31 03:27:16] tools_: hmmm

[2015-08-31 03:28:21] prohobo: i execute script, it just sits there
[2015-08-31 03:29:28] prohobo: is this supposed to open an instance of Chrome or something?
[2015-08-31 03:29:34] prohobo: or is this headless
[2015-08-31 03:29:39] tools_: ./ is current dir
[2015-08-31 03:30:13] tools_: The script I send, opens a chrome instance very shortly and then gives this

[2015-08-31 03:30:41] prohobo: hmm yea
[2015-08-31 03:31:19] prohobo: maybe i have wrong version of chrome?

[2015-08-31 07:17:16] harbhub: so the issue is that putting a setTimeout in the isDisplayed() function handler is causing that function in the setTimeout to never fire

[2015-08-31 07:17:47] harbhub: at least there are no more errors appearing, but the test will need to have setTimeout working

[2015-08-31 11:41:01] cansado: possibly due to the incredibly overused word 'tag'
[2015-08-31 11:41:26] sircapsalot: tags? :)
[2015-08-31 11:41:37] sircapsalot: what sort of tags
[2015-08-31 11:41:56] dude-x: cansado: tags sounds like a test framework feature
[2015-08-31 11:41:57] cansado: just an identifier above a Feature or Scenario, beginning with "@"
[2015-08-31 11:42:09] sircapsalot: you mean a Java Annotation?
[2015-08-31 11:42:22] cansado: no, it's part of the gherkin syntax, iirc
[2015-08-31 11:43:43] cansado: http://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/guides/1.gherkin.html#tags <- these guys
[2015-08-31 11:44:40] smccarthy: cansado: as dude-x said, I think its part of the test framework. I know TestNG has groups (similar to your tags)
[2015-08-31 11:45:05] dude-x: cansado: so that's a feature that's dependent on the test framework. in Java you can use annotations to "tag" your tests under specific categories; python's py.test uses 'marks'

[2015-08-31 15:05:47] lukeis: Phasze: i'd like to note the lack of reproducible pages to do this on ;)
[2015-08-31 15:05:55] jimevans: Phasze: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-08-31 15:06:43] lukeis: oh wait, the first one includes one :)
[2015-08-31 15:07:30] Phasze: my workaround makes me sad and it's been this way for a long time now so that's why I ask :)

[2015-08-31 15:07:49] jimevans: Phasze: the lack of a pull request actually fixing the issue makes me sad.
[2015-08-31 15:08:09] jimevans: i apologize. that was harsh.
[2015-08-31 15:08:19] Phasze: jimevans: could you direct me to a general area/file I could start to look at to fix this?
[2015-08-31 15:08:24] Phasze: then I'll do a pull request

[2015-08-31 15:08:40] jimevans: i've gotten the runaround from several customer service organizations today, and i'm bitter and grumpy.
[2015-08-31 15:11:52] Phasze: I'm guessing the fix would be here like the first bug suggested.  Is there a quick way to test this without building the entire project? https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/firefox-driver/js/utils.js
[2015-08-31 15:12:44] jimevans: Phasze: i'd guess probably not.
[2015-08-31 15:13:00] jimevans: assuming, of course, you have a test case that can prove the issue is fixed.
[2015-08-31 15:13:07] Phasze: yes I do
[2015-08-31 15:13:47] Phasze: why does firefox driver have to be built in? :(
[2015-08-31 15:14:36] jimevans: as opposed to?
[2015-08-31 15:14:43] barancev: today's marionette score: Tests run: 583, Failures: 1, Errors: 7, Time elapsed: 1 319,997 sec
[2015-08-31 15:14:57] Phasze: separated like IEDriver and chromedriver?
[2015-08-31 15:14:59] jimevans: barancev: how many ignored test?
[2015-08-31 15:15:07] barancev: close to 600 successful tests
[2015-08-31 15:15:14] jimevans: Phasze: that's the approach taken by marionette (mozilla
[2015-08-31 15:15:20] jimevans: mozilla's firefox driver)
[2015-08-31 15:15:28] jimevans: soon to be released.
[2015-08-31 15:15:31] jimevans: for some value of "soon"
[2015-08-31 15:15:48] Phasze: would that work for all versions of firefox?
[2015-08-31 15:15:58] jimevans: Phasze: nope. just recent ones.
[2015-08-31 15:16:30] barancev: jimevans: firefoxdriver passes 821 tests atm
[2015-08-31 15:16:31] oida, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-31 15:16:38] Phasze: jimevans: so would the current official FF version be supported?
[2015-08-31 15:16:50] jimevans: but at the rate mozilla releases, that's going to overtake other firefox versions pretty quickly
[2015-08-31 15:17:06] lukeis: selenium conference is now close enough to be on the 10-day forecast!  hope it holds, partly cloudy, upper 70s, would be very nice for portland
[2015-08-31 15:17:38] jimevans: Phasze: since we quit supporting native events on firefox, anything in the release channel should be good.
[2015-08-31 15:17:49] jimevans: i think it's 42 where we start to run into problems
[2015-08-31 15:17:55] Danjo1, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-08-31 15:17:58] jimevans: someone correct me if i'm wrong.
[2015-08-31 15:18:11] jimevans: i've stopped keeping track of firefox versions since we don't do native events anymore.
[2015-08-31 15:18:25] jimevans: i have enough to worry about with IE compatibility.
[2015-08-31 15:18:33] Phasze: will the new marionette support native?
[2015-08-31 15:18:39] lukeis: 41 we have a fix for in master (we need to release)… 42 is borked
[2015-08-31 15:19:08] ET1, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-08-31 15:19:21] barancev: jimevans: do we quit?
[2015-08-31 15:19:28] jimevans: Phasze: not exactly, but that's not something the selenium project has any control over.
[2015-08-31 15:20:03] jimevans: do we quit what?
[2015-08-31 15:20:05] lukeis: it's not "OS" level native… but could be browser level native, but I don't know for sure what they've done ;)
[2015-08-31 15:20:16] *barancev is preparing a large sword to cut native events'
[2015-08-31 15:20:31] jimevans: IE still uses native events.
[2015-08-31 15:20:39] barancev: do we quit supporting native events in firefoxdriver?
[2015-08-31 15:21:12] jimevans: but we haven't supported native events in firefox for anything after, i think, 31 (actually it was 33, i think, but those have rolled off the supported list now)
[2015-08-31 15:21:34] jimevans: but i don't remember the details, and i don't care enough to look it up for sure.
[2015-08-31 15:23:15] Phasze: next question for you jimevans, would there be a better way in C# to make this work?  currently if I see a '(' about to be typed in the input field I replace it with Keys.Shift + "9" + Keys.Shift before sending off to SendKeys()

[2015-08-31 15:25:38] jimevans: i honestly don't know. you have a specific edge case for the firefox driver. i don't have any specific expertise with the internals of the firefox driver. every time i have to look into it, i have to spend significant effort re-learning where things are. i strongly suspect that the issue you raise isn't unique to the .NET bindings, so i'm going to plead ignorance.
