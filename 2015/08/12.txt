[2015-08-12 03:16:42] pauluchon: Do you know why there is no SafariDriver 2.46 and 2.47 ? Is there still support for this driver ?
[2015-08-12 03:21:09] sgsabbage: my understanding of SafariDriver is that it's no longer bundled into Selenium because recent changes in Safari mean it can't be auto installed. Instead you just manually install whatever the latest is, as per https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/SafariDriver
[2015-08-12 03:21:22] sgsabbage: I assume there's no 2.46 or 2.47 because the versioning is now decoupled

[2015-08-12 07:40:01] dude-x: does the test run to completion despite showing nothing?
[2015-08-12 07:40:05] niklongstone: dude-x, It was I am expecting like in standalone selenium, but I see just the X workspace with possibilities to press right mouse button to access the menu
[2015-08-12 07:40:51] niklongstone: I suspect that the test, present on a remote machine, is configured for an headless mode
[2015-08-12 07:41:15] dude-x: i think chrome would complain that it doesn't have a window to render to
[2015-08-12 07:41:30] dude-x: it can't run headless as far as I know unless Google changed something recently.
[2015-08-12 07:43:01] dimacus: titusfortner: do you know how the versioning of the binary is done? the download only seems to point to latest… but how do i know i have latests on my machine?

[2015-08-12 07:50:15] jimevans: dimacus: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-08-12 07:50:32] jimevans: the servicing story is microsoft update.
[2015-08-12 07:50:53] jimevans: i'd imagine you could probably query into the windows update service to see what updates have been applied.
[2015-08-12 07:51:31] jimevans: there used to be a way to do that (using wmi, if i recall correctly, but as you know, my memory isn't anything to write home about).

[2015-08-12 07:54:02] dimacus: but my assumption now is, once you installed the edgeDriver msi, the windows update will be responsible for keeping it up to date?

[2015-08-12 07:54:50] jimevans: the other option is if they pump the version numbers of the .exe, which would be relatively easy to figure out
[2015-08-12 07:55:04] jimevans: but i don't have any special insight into whether that's what MSFT will do or not.

[2015-08-12 07:59:55] smccarthy: jimevans: everything on that page says Status = Complete. Do I have to know to look for Commands that are missing to know they are incomplete?

[2015-08-12 08:47:58] WhereIsMySpoon: Auto1: no
[2015-08-12 08:48:01] rets5s: WhereIsMySpoon: I am talking about this https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docs
[2015-08-12 08:48:35] rets5s: WhereIsMySpoon: I would like to rework whole website and add more details to but I need know who maintains it first.
[2015-08-12 08:49:11] rets5s: WhereIsMySpoon: The last update was 4 months ago.
[2015-08-12 08:49:25] WhereIsMySpoon: rets5s: i think all of the selenium team maintain it
[2015-08-12 08:49:42] WhereIsMySpoon: rets5s: if you have stuff to add just branch off, then make a pull request
[2015-08-12 08:50:06] rets5s: WhereIsMySpoon: Alright. I guess I will do that.

[2015-08-12 09:49:20] rananda, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-12 09:49:47] dude-x: does selenium use wicked good xpath for all browsers or only IE
[2015-08-12 09:50:07] jimevans: just IE
[2015-08-12 09:50:11] titusfortner: So what does this mean as far as supporting xpath selection in webdriver?
[2015-08-12 09:50:12] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-12 09:51:18] jimevans: titusfortner: it means that, in theory, a language binding could "roll their own" support. it'd be ugly, but it could be done. i'm frankly surprised the MSFT team didn't get it done in the initial release.
[2015-08-12 09:51:43] jimevans: and by "roll their own" i mean do so without shoving a massive amount of javascript across the wire
[2015-08-12 09:52:06] titusfortner: What would make it ugly?
[2015-08-12 09:52:41] jimevans: the fact that you'd have to call javascript and handle the element serialization yourself. plus the edge driver wouldn't know anything about the elements you found.
[2015-08-12 09:53:20] titusfortner: This sounds like a very interesting way to learn about how some of these technologies work together. :)
[2015-08-12 09:53:30] jimevans: so any methods on WebElement objects that you retrieved using xpath would need to be refound, or cached somehow in the browser to be used again.
[2015-08-12 09:53:41] jimevans: it'd be truly, mind-bogglingly ugly.
[2015-08-12 09:54:42] titusfortner: Heh, actually, that almost makes it sound like Watir could implement the solution better than Selenium, since it already caches/lazy loads
[2015-08-12 09:54:59] jimevans: remember, when you get an "element" back from a driver implementation, all you're getting is an opaque ID that, when passed back over the wire in subsequent webdriver calls, the driver implementation can look up the *actual* DOM node and manipulate it.

[2015-08-12 09:55:16] jimevans: unless you have a hook into that browser's native element implementations, you'll be kinda out of luck.
[2015-08-12 09:56:01] jimevans: the classic watir would be able to do it, because it held onto COM objects representing the actual DOM elements.
[2015-08-12 09:56:03] lukeis: heh, jimevans i like the statement in there "This product uses Wicked Good Xpath."
[2015-08-12 09:56:16] jimevans: :)
[2015-08-12 09:56:23] jimevans: it also uses part of Chromium. :)
[2015-08-12 09:56:33] lukeis: interesting :)
[2015-08-12 09:56:38] swampdragons, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-12 09:56:54] titusfortner: So the element object found by xpath in this situation would not be re-usable directly
[2015-08-12 09:57:01] jimevans: only for video playback, though.
[2015-08-12 09:57:35] jimevans: titusfortner: i dunno. depends on if the return of elements from javascript is done correctly in the edge driver.
[2015-08-12 09:58:29] swampdragons: Hey Jim Santi mentioned that you all are looking at using the beta versions of browsers in your selenium builds.  If you have issues with them feel free to ping me directly.
[2015-08-12 09:59:23] lukeis: swampdragons: I think i may be doing that soon (namely with Firefox)
[2015-08-12 09:59:25] jimevans: swampdragons: i believe we are, yes. lukeis would be one to follow up on that.
[2015-08-12 09:59:55] lukeis: maybe i should do that today before I leave for vacation for the rest of the week ;)
[2015-08-12 10:00:07] *lukeis going to a place where my phone won't work :-D'
[2015-08-12 10:00:29] swampdragons: hah maybe best to wait until you're back then
[2015-08-12 10:00:39] lukeis: nah ;)
[2015-08-12 10:00:42] swampdragons: :D

[2015-08-12 15:31:38] lukeis: exactly as it sounds?
[2015-08-12 15:31:50] dude-x: today it should be be 41
[2015-08-12 15:31:53] lukeis: "Firefox beta" running on Saucelabs
[2015-08-12 15:31:55] dude-x: but sauce? who knows
[2015-08-12 15:32:04] lukeis: the beta knows no number ;)
[2015-08-12 15:32:27] lukeis: but yes, i believe it would be 41
[2015-08-12 15:33:03] lukeis: i've been told saucelabs updates their Firefox beta image frequently
[2015-08-12 15:33:09] dude-x: ah
[2015-08-12 15:33:15] lukeis: swampdragons: is that a fair statement ^

[2015-08-12 15:38:01] swampdragons: looks like 40
[2015-08-12 15:38:16] swampdragons: oh yeah that makes sense last ff release was 39 so 41 should be dev
[2015-08-12 15:38:31] lukeis: yeah, there was just a release, i would be the beta channel to change soon
[2015-08-12 15:39:20] swampdragons: indeed. It doesn't seem to have been updated yet though
[2015-08-12 15:39:33] swampdragons: sauce has a cron task that runs once a day to scrape down the latest beta
[2015-08-12 15:39:45] swampdragons: so if it changed since this morning around 8am then we wouldn't have gotten it yet
[2015-08-12 15:39:54] lukeis: cool, once a day :) that's frequent enough for me

[2015-08-12 15:53:50] lukeis:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-08-12 15:53:53] lukeis: ask tourdedave
[2015-08-12 15:54:11] dude-x: nice looking site, no links to scheduled talks
[2015-08-12 15:54:21] juangj: if i do somehow break it (whenever simonstewart updates the DNS), let me know
[2015-08-12 15:54:49] titusfortner: I think they just decided the talks earlier this week
