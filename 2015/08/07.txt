[2015-08-07 08:32:50] lukeis: start trying to deal with differences in dialect by maintaining a 'w3c' variable per driver instance?
[2015-08-07 08:33:01] lukeis: python started doing this...
[2015-08-07 08:33:05] titusfortner: is that how python is doing it?
[2015-08-07 08:33:09] titusfortner: :)
[2015-08-07 08:33:55] lukeis: this should give a picture of how:  06fd3f
[2015-08-07 08:34:55] lukeis: this in particular is the current method of "detection" https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/py/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py#L141-L142
[2015-08-07 08:34:59] lukeis: but that will hopefully change
[2015-08-07 08:35:31] lukeis: there's a proposal to have w3c compliant drivers return a 'specLevel' capability with a new session
[2015-08-07 08:35:50] titusfortner: Jari at one point suggested something along the lines that the different bindings in Selenium should all be doing the same-ish things, just in their own way... It doesn't feel like there is that much coordination right now. Is that by design or necessity or... ? Or is this a conversation I have with people when I'm buying them beers at the conference? :-D
[2015-08-07 08:36:24] titusfortner: specLevel variable sounds interesting
[2015-08-07 08:36:37] lukeis: beers at the conference will be good ;)
[2015-08-07 08:36:42] lukeis: (not that you'll have to buy them)
[2015-08-07 08:37:37] lukeis: there's never been "much coordination" rather just each language has been watching the others to see what is happenings
[2015-08-07 08:38:39] titusfortner: I've budgeted a fair amount for beer buying at the conference. :)

[2015-08-07 10:03:15] WhereIsMySpoon: darkfrog: edge really doesnt have a lot to do with the bindings
[2015-08-07 10:03:22] WhereIsMySpoon: it has more to do with the internals and the drivers
[2015-08-07 10:03:28] *lukeis would expect problems trying to run Edge driver ;)'

[2015-08-07 12:58:13] Alchemy: running on the os
[2015-08-07 12:58:16] Alchemy: not the browser
[2015-08-07 12:58:23] Alchemy: is they are handled by the browser send keys will work

[2015-08-07 13:00:33] dude-x: even better the Actions key should work
[2015-08-07 13:00:53] dude-x: Alt-f1 is probably not captured by the browser

[2015-08-07 14:21:03] lukeis: at first I didn't understand why firefox wasn't capitalizing after the dashâ€¦. but then I read the email chain in that and saw:  A key question is what happens to a hyphenated word, should "well-intended" become
[2015-08-07 14:21:03] lukeis: "Well-Intended" or "Well-intended"?
[2015-08-07 14:22:29] lukeis:  Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯   convert any 'find by link text' to xpath ;)
[2015-08-07 14:22:53] jleyba: lukeis, that'd be a pretty big change b/c it goes from "visible link text" to "DOM text"
[2015-08-07 14:23:02] lukeis: yep

[2015-08-07 14:23:25] jleyba: I wonder if visible text is surprising for link text

[2015-08-07 14:42:42] titusfortner: Am I the only one who rankles when people use the term "smoke testing" when it comes to automated tests? Is it really best practice to split your suite into multiple sections based on importance/likelihood to actually pass?

[2015-08-07 14:43:38] yenaemj, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-07 14:54:52] sevaseva: titusfortner: Yes, I think so. You often want to run a small suite of fast tests (and/or some of those that catch "everything is broken") all the time and some other tests sometimes
[2015-08-07 14:55:50] dude-x: titusfortner: when you have hundreds of tests and the total runtime exceeds 10-15 minutes then you want to isolate it to a few, core, "smoke" tests.
[2015-08-07 14:56:37] titusfortner: Hmmm. Wish I could remember who gave the talk on anti-smoke testing.
[2015-08-07 14:56:57] titusfortner: Parallelizing with sufficient resources solves the speed issue, and relative to manual it's all lightning fast
[2015-08-07 14:57:07] titusfortner: so at what point is it splitting hairs
[2015-08-07 14:57:29] dude-x: it's about doing what you can with the resources you have
[2015-08-07 14:57:38] titusfortner: and yeah, last company was actually 400 hours, but, yeah, let's not get started on that one.
[2015-08-07 14:58:12] titusfortner: my point being that when starting up automated process at a new company. Calling a suite a smoke test seems to be waving a white flag before you've even started
[2015-08-07 14:59:26] dude-x: you don't have access to a nice grid where tests can be distributed among a largish grid, then you divvy up your tests into smoke and slow
[2015-08-07 14:59:42] dude-x: oh.
[2015-08-07 14:59:59] dude-x: well you still want to identify tests that are crucial even if you don't discriminate on their test runs
[2015-08-07 15:00:00] notthemessiah, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-07 15:00:54] titusfortner: so we have a set of non-crucial tests where we don't care as much if they fail?
[2015-08-07 15:01:07] titusfortner: but we spend a bunch of resources keeping up to date and ensuring they aren't flaky?
[2015-08-07 15:01:42] titusfortner: also, #codingatabar in case this isn't clear
[2015-08-07 15:02:03] sevaseva: titusfortner: No one can force you build for tests of different priorities if you don't want that or don't need to (e.g. if you have all the resources). But you will say yourself thank you later for not designing that out forever

[2015-08-07 15:02:52] lukeis: titusfortner: we would use a prohibitively expense amount of compute if we tried to run our tests in parallel to reduce the total runtime to a 'reasonable' time to wait for results ;)
[2015-08-07 15:03:09] notthemessiah: Anyone use Selenium WebDriver on Polymer (WebComponents) elements or anything with Shadow DOM?
[2015-08-07 15:03:26] titusfortner: what is total time for your tests, ooc?
[2015-08-07 15:03:52] lukeis: titusfortner: that's really hard to sayâ€¦ for all tests for all browsers?
[2015-08-07 15:04:05] cylon512, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-07 15:04:14] titusfortner: sure?
[2015-08-07 15:04:50] titusfortner: Like I said, last company was 400 hours, mostly Firefox/Windows but we were trying to switch to Chrome/Linux
[2015-08-07 15:05:06] titusfortner: definitely didn't do cross-platform/browser
[2015-08-07 15:05:08] sevaseva: titusfortner: I cannot say exactly how many thousands of changes get committed per minute to some reporitories and how many hundred of thousand of tests there are to run :)
[2015-08-07 15:05:15] lukeis: i've heard someone say a 'full' run over all of those, is equivalent to 3 1/2 years of compute timeâ€¦. but reasonably it takes about 1-2 days from checkin till all tests have been run
[2015-08-07 15:06:56] rorycb, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-07 15:07:11] titusfortner: and they all pass? :)

[2015-08-07 15:07:18] lukeis: lolâ€¦ i wish

[2015-08-07 15:08:30] sgsabbage: the environment I have running at $job has a few tests that must run first - they're more generalised and will hopefully pick up any big problems quickly, then the rest of the suite runs. All tests have to pass, but the build will fail if any tests fail
[2015-08-07 15:08:36] titusfortner: Last job we were supposed to re-run/manually verify anything that failed, but...
[2015-08-07 15:09:15] sgsabbage: the ones we designate 'smoke tests' just run first out of all of those because they're the ones that are most likely to fail (fail fast etc..)
[2015-08-07 15:09:37] titusfortner: Yeah, that makes more sense to me. Unit then component then integration then functional or the like; don't run the latter if former fails

[2015-08-07 17:54:38] steminist: is this what I am searching for?
[2015-08-07 17:54:51] dude-x__: yes
[2015-08-07 17:55:42] steminist: so I would do driver.find_element_by_css_selector("submit")
[2015-08-07 17:55:44] steminist: ?
[2015-08-07 17:55:52] dude-x__: no
[2015-08-07 17:56:00] dude-x__: submit is an attribute of an element
[2015-08-07 17:56:13] dude-x__: what's the tag name for that submit button

[2015-08-07 17:58:32] steminist: .submit {     margin: 1em 0 0.5em 7em; }
[2015-08-07 17:59:50] dude-x__: a css selector is not the css description; in the above line the selector part is just '.submit'
[2015-08-07 18:00:08] dude-x__: so for that element you can use '.submit'
[2015-08-07 18:00:22] dude-x__: in a CSS selector the . matches the class name
[2015-08-07 18:00:50] steminist:    driver.find_element_by_css_selector('.submit').click()
[2015-08-07 18:00:52] dude-x__: so for that element: you can write input.submit[type='submit'] as a css selector
[2015-08-07 18:00:57] dude-x__: steminist: yeah that may work
[2015-08-07 18:01:23] dude-x__: it may work because if there's more than one element that matches .submit, it will click the first one it finds (the topmost)
[2015-08-07 18:01:51] steminist: there is only one element in the submit class
[2015-08-07 18:02:00] dude-x__: then you're good to go
[2015-08-07 18:02:07] dude-x__: steminist: i'm going home now
