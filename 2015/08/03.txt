[2015-08-03 05:32:41] sgsabbage: mad4kL That's the one - what version of chromedriver are you running?
[2015-08-03 05:33:18] mad4k: 2.16
[2015-08-03 05:33:38] mad4k: also newest from the site, also the same error is happening when i try to use the test in firefox
[2015-08-03 05:33:42] sgsabbage: cool - how are you running headless?
[2015-08-03 05:33:48] mad4k: i am thinking that my testfile might suck
[2015-08-03 05:34:40] mad4k: using xvfb
[2015-08-03 05:34:47] mad4k: http://alex.nederlof.com/blog/2012/11/19/installing-selenium-with-jenkins-on-ubuntu/ i followed this tutorial
[2015-08-03 05:35:18] mad4k: i recorded a test using the selenium IDE so its just a html file and no script, do you mind having a look at it if that might cause the trouble?
[2015-08-03 05:36:29] sgsabbage: ah, IDE is also deprecated and as such I know nothing about it, but I dunno if that's the problem, let me see what my server returns when launching chrome

[2015-08-03 05:45:40] mad4k: maybe you can provide a generic testfile for me that i can run trough to see if its my test that causes the problems
[2015-08-03 05:45:50] sgsabbage: well, just create a test that goes to google.com
[2015-08-03 05:45:58] sgsabbage: doesn't have to do anything else - what bindings are you using anyway?
[2015-08-03 05:46:03] mad4k: thats exactly what i did
[2015-08-03 05:46:09] mad4k: define bindings?
[2015-08-03 05:47:32] sgsabbage: what language
[2015-08-03 05:47:55] mad4k: oh, as i said i currently use a generated html from the IDE and just exported it
[2015-08-03 05:48:14] mad4k: i was planning to use python... but i am open for any other recommendation
[2015-08-03 05:48:28] sgsabbage: python is good - the language bindings are well documented
[2015-08-03 05:48:58] mad4k: so ill just call the .jarfile with python instead of a html file?
[2015-08-03 05:50:12] mad4k: or do i integrate the server call in the python test?
[2015-08-03 05:50:19] sgsabbage: no - assuming you're using Remote WebDriver (http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#module-selenium.webdriver.remote.webdriver) you'd start the server and then run the tests using something like PyTest
[2015-08-03 05:51:15] mad4k: oh, nice source ... well i plan to do a Testing CI build with git and jenkins... but that definitley seems possible
[2015-08-03 05:52:19] sgsabbage: using remote webdriver with jenkins is very much the best way (imho)
[2015-08-03 05:53:11] mad4k: ..okay on the wording again... what is the difference between remote-webdriver and the one i installed (selenium-standalone-server)
[2015-08-03 05:53:51] CTtpollard: it allows to to execute tests on the non server machine
[2015-08-03 05:54:23] CTtpollard: so if you're running a server os, you can send webdriver jobs to a machine with a generic desktop os
[2015-08-03 05:55:52] mad4k: i see like a orchestrator for the jobs, can i also just use webdriver and test on the same machine?
[2015-08-03 05:56:31] CTtpollard: yes

[2015-08-03 07:21:59] WhereIsMySpoon: seleniumUser500: maybe you could get them some training so they can do basic programming and then make automated tests?
[2015-08-03 07:22:03] davehunt: seleniumUser500: for a good quality of test automation, a reasonable level of programming skill is recommended
[2015-08-03 07:22:39] WhereIsMySpoon: seleniumUser500: automated testing is programming, there is no way around it. Every single record-playback tool will be inferior to programmed tests
[2015-08-03 07:22:44] davehunt: the record and play tools are very limited, and the tests they generate are hard to maintain
[2015-08-03 07:22:46] WhereIsMySpoon: no matter how shiny it may look
[2015-08-03 07:22:48] sgsabbage: also, there is always a space for manual testing, especially in the exploratory arena
[2015-08-03 07:23:24] seleniumUser500: I know where is some manual testing. Let me explain the system i was trying to create
[2015-08-03 07:23:45] Dave_B_: Your QAs exploratory test & write the tests that then get automated
[2015-08-03 07:23:52] Dave_B_: oh, sorry hadn't scrolled down
[2015-08-03 07:24:11] smccarthy, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-03 07:25:05] Dave_B_: I don't automate every possible testcase for my site, things in dev get manually tested way more extensively than we create automation for - the automation is a regression guard for core functionality (the QAs tend to be good at identifying a few main TCs to cover most of the important stuff)
[2015-08-03 07:25:44] seleniumUser500: When a QA person finds a bug, they would attach a recorded automation to hit this bug with the bug ticket. After a programmer fixes then issue the QA verifies it, reruns his test and if test passed, we would take that automation, export it as NUnit and add it to out CI test list to be run after each build or nightly.
[2015-08-03 07:25:56] Dave_B_: tho we're also training all our QAs to code so they can become slightly involved in the automation (I maintain the model, runner, anything complex, they can add on / debug test cases)
[2015-08-03 07:26:11] Dave_B_: the problem is that'll cost you loads to maintain
[2015-08-03 07:26:51] Dave_B_: the biggest cost of automation is maintenance not creation so faster creation at the expense of maintainability is a poor tradeoff
[2015-08-03 07:27:33] seleniumUser500: Dave_B_: so do you have CI at your work?
[2015-08-03 07:27:42] Dave_B_: yep
[2015-08-03 07:28:02] seleniumUser500: so what kind of test are in there? everything that is written by developers?
[2015-08-03 07:28:20] auto_sam, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-03 07:28:26] davehunt: seleniumUser500: it might work if instead of exporting the test case, you have someone write it based on the steps.. that way your record and playback is a tool for verifying a fix, and your regression tests can be more maintainable
[2015-08-03 07:28:56] Dave_B_: The tests are qwritten by QAs but automated by developers using a model to keep maintenance costs down
[2015-08-03 07:29:12] Dave_B_: as well as normal dev-written stuff like unit tests etc of course
[2015-08-03 07:29:19] davehunt: there's a place for record and play, but I wouldn't recommend it as a source of your regression suite

[2015-08-03 07:32:19] seleniumUser500: so QAs basically write down 1) click 'A' 2) click 'B' send that info to some programmer and he automates it into something CI can run?
[2015-08-03 07:33:48] seleniumUser500: i appreciate the help guys. Been trying to figure how to do this for a week. Our problem is that none of our QAs know any programming and then its time to do regression thay have to run through a bunch of test manually

[2015-08-03 07:43:17] WhereIsMySpoon: kris_: it's probably complex because not many people use it and so not many complain and so it isnt a prioritised issue
[2015-08-03 07:43:17] sgsabbage: wait, what is opera-developer? https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/OperaDriver seems to suggest it's looking for /usr/bin/opera or /usr/bin/opera-next
[2015-08-03 07:43:28] WhereIsMySpoon: or you're just doing it wrong
[2015-08-03 07:43:48] sgsabbage: erk, no that's docs for Presto
[2015-08-03 07:43:53] kris_: probably Im doing it wrong
[2015-08-03 07:43:54] *sgsabbage is confusing everything today'
[2015-08-03 07:44:14] kris_: opera-developer is opera chromium
[2015-08-03 07:44:27] kris_: atleast installing .deb it sets up opera-developer
[2015-08-03 07:44:38] sgsabbage: yeah, sorry, that was the Presto docs again
[2015-08-03 07:45:25] kris_: but using Presto (I assume its presto, not so familiar with all the opera stuff) v12.16, I am getting  Error for /wd/hub/session java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/json/JSONObject
[2015-08-03 07:45:53] kris_: also tried to add json to classpath, for both, node and grid, still the same

[2015-08-03 07:46:12] WhereIsMySpoon: you cant use presto i thought
[2015-08-03 07:46:36] WhereIsMySpoon: need to use: {"browserName":"opera","chromeOptions":{"args":[],"extensions":[],"binary":"C:/Program Files/Opera/opera.exe"}}
[2015-08-03 07:46:38] WhereIsMySpoon: this guy says

[2015-08-03 07:47:05] WhereIsMySpoon: chromeOptions for opera
[2015-08-03 07:47:09] WhereIsMySpoon: such sense making
[2015-08-03 07:47:18] sgsabbage: bear in mind that's when requesting the browser, not in the node config
[2015-08-03 07:47:36] sgsabbage: in terms of node config I have zero idea what it's looking for
[2015-08-03 07:48:05] kris_: worth a try
[2015-08-03 07:49:30] sgsabbage: just to check, you're using OperaChromiumDriver rather than OperaDriver? The error you're getting seems to suggest that the error is coming from the Presto driver ( say that because googling the error only seems to come up with Presto)
[2015-08-03 07:50:03] sgsabbage: vs "unknown error: cannot find Opera binary"
[2015-08-03 07:50:14] sgsabbage: which is the error in the issue linked above
[2015-08-03 07:50:35] kris_: at the moment I am not defining to use any driver at all
[2015-08-03 07:51:01] kris_: like for chrome its -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="/opt/selenium-node-lin/chromedriver"
[2015-08-03 07:51:35] kris_: tried to add both drivers, presto and chromium, nothing

[2015-08-03 07:53:15] sgsabbage: wondering if it's picking up the wrong one or something silly like that
[2015-08-03 07:54:13] kris_: havent defined nothing on servers PATH, for chromedriver it wasnt necessary at least
[2015-08-03 07:55:38] sgsabbage: what does the node's output look like when an opera session is requested?
[2015-08-03 07:55:43] seleniumUser500: WhereIsMySpoon: so do you think its a good idea if we have a QAs create an automation for a bug using the FF IDE plugin then send that automation as HTML to a developer so he can rewrite that test into an NUnit test to be placed in out CI test queue?

[2015-08-03 08:22:43] dude-x: the problem i was overcoming was that the linux station i was on would just choke on multiple requests, but if you spawn lots of connections within various times of each other, that would work.
[2015-08-03 08:23:40] smccarthy: dude-x: awesome, yea thats kind of what I think I was solving with my waits (100 within 1 second may not work, but ramping up to 100 over 15 seconds may)
[2015-08-03 08:25:34] smccarthy: Does anyone know if the SeConf will be live streamed this year? Or only recorded and posted online later?

[2015-08-03 12:38:19] LocusAsaf: Regarding organizing page objects properly, can anyone share their experience with working with light boxes?
[2015-08-03 12:38:36] LocusAsaf: do they get their own page, are they a part of the existing page that they spawn from?
[2015-08-03 12:39:29] dude-x: light boxes are usually css and javascript
[2015-08-03 12:39:38] dude-x: otherwise it's a javascript alert.
[2015-08-03 12:40:48] kyoob: if there's a feature in your application that shows up across many different pages, like the same lightbox, you might want to give it its own page object
[2015-08-03 12:42:06] dude-x: yeah anything that is shared should just be it's own page object, you may name it 'component object' to categorize it as a 'shared' page object.
[2015-08-03 12:42:59] merike|away, changing nick to merike.
[2015-08-03 12:43:10] kyoob: same for headers, footers, what have you. you don't want to have to remember that you put all the footer stuff in your homePage page object
[2015-08-03 12:43:46] smccarthy: I have them as components, and use composition for them. So I never instantiate a component in my test, I only instantiate page objects in my tests. My page objects instantiate the components (footer, header, light boxes, etc)
[2015-08-03 12:43:54] kyoob: or have some other programmer have to figure it out
[2015-08-03 12:49:10] LocusAsaf: okay so I get for re-used light boxes, but what about for ones that are specific to a page
[2015-08-03 12:49:23] AutomatedTester: anyone know how to make Github deeplinks work?
[2015-08-03 12:49:25] LocusAsaf: smccarthy: what do you mean by component, I'm not familiar with how that works with page objects
[2015-08-03 12:49:27] AutomatedTester: e.g. https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/wiki/jsonwireprotocol#GET_/status.md
[2015-08-03 12:50:13] jleyba: AutomatedTester, https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/wiki/jsonwireprotocol#status
[2015-08-03 12:50:14] jleyba: ?
[2015-08-03 12:50:34] kyoob: LocusAsaf: i think there might not be one right answer to the question
[2015-08-03 12:50:39] AutomatedTester: jleyba: that works! Thanks
[2015-08-03 12:50:46] jleyba: That page is a bit of a mess. Don't think anyone has done anything with it since lukeis ported from googlecode
[2015-08-03 12:51:02] LocusAsaf: kyoob: that's fine, I have no answers right now actually I'm just approaching the problem
[2015-08-03 12:51:12] kyoob: if it's going to be onerous to set up a separate page object for a lightbox because it's too specifically tied to an existing thing, then just tie it to that thing
[2015-08-03 12:51:13] LocusAsaf: just looking for everyones personal experience
[2015-08-03 12:51:29] kyoob: you can always abstract it out later
[2015-08-03 12:51:33] jleyba: inheritance solves all the problems
[2015-08-03 12:51:36] jleyba: and using webdriver api directly
[2015-08-03 12:52:19] smccarthy: LocusAsaf: Just a class with the methods for that component. So one example is a left hand nav. It is the same for all page in the left hand nav. So I create a LeftHandNav class, which has methods to click each of the links in the left hand nav and returns the correct page object. That page object has an instance of LeftHandNav. So in my test I could so something like , myPage.leftHandNav.goToThisOtherPage() - which retu
[2015-08-03 12:52:20] smccarthy: rns ThisOtherPAge
[2015-08-03 12:52:29] LocusAsaf: kyoob: so let's say its tied to a page object.  You have to click something first to make it appear.  So there is a function that is like "click_button_open_light_box" or some sort and then certain functions for the page object that only work once its visible?
[2015-08-03 12:53:53] kyoob: that is a way to do it, for sure. otherwise clicking that button could return a lightbox page object
[2015-08-03 12:54:00] LocusAsaf: smccarthy: so you consider a component stuff like navigations menus, so in this case a light box is just another component that is not a page but contained inside of a page as an instance of some sort
[2015-08-03 12:54:26] smccarthy: LocusAsaf: for me, yes (but I am not saying my way is the right way, or the only way)
[2015-08-03 12:54:27] LocusAsaf: smccarthy: in other words the only way to access it is to use it through the page
[2015-08-03 12:54:34] smccarthy: correct, in my case
[2015-08-03 12:54:44] LocusAsaf: smccarthy: understood just trying to understand your model
[2015-08-03 12:54:51] smccarthy: Ok yup :)
[2015-08-03 12:55:33] LocusAsaf: My team and I are currently building a selenium test suite with page objects so everything is sort of new to us.  We are just going piece by piece so when a new question comes along I like to get feedback from the fine folks here
