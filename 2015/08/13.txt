[2015-08-13 07:25:00] WhereIsMySpoon: Quiloopee: can u execute "time.sleep" in a small one line python script and see if it runs?

[2015-08-13 08:33:50] AnConio: oh...that would have been sweet; hear good things about Portland
[2015-08-13 08:34:00] AnConio: is your employer footing the bill?
[2015-08-13 08:34:13] jimevans: for my travel, yes.
[2015-08-13 08:34:45] sircapsalot: me too jimevans :D
[2015-08-13 08:35:16] sircapsalot: on both accounts
[2015-08-13 08:37:34] AnConio: Hmn, I really should stay more up to date on this stuff
[2015-08-13 08:38:08] tourdedave: AnConio: there are still a few tickets left :-)

[2015-08-13 08:40:11] AnConio: Yeah I saw that...not sure if my employer would chip in to be honest
[2015-08-13 08:40:40] AnConio: I think they should...especially since I am in charge and am the "SME" on getting test automation up and running here
[2015-08-13 08:40:46] AnConio: and I am a newbie
[2015-08-13 08:41:17] Nizumzen, quitting. (Quit: KVIrc 4.2.0 Equilibrium http://www.kvirc.net/)
[2015-08-13 08:41:21] AnConio: I'd be more interested on the workshops...well not more but also...and those are sold out
[2015-08-13 08:42:13] smccarthy: The conference is awesome. Its great that it is so low cost (compared to other conferences).
[2015-08-13 08:42:21] sircapsalot: it took me 5 years at my place, in order for me to get compensated.. i was doing selenium far sooner than anyone at the company was.. people got to go to GTAC and SeConf when i didn't.. i'm finally able to
[2015-08-13 08:42:35] sircapsalot: AND OsCon for that matter
[2015-08-13 08:43:39] smccarthy: The only conference I get to go to this year is : http://iteratephx.co/

[2015-08-13 08:45:11] AnConio: Only afer 5 years were you allowed/paid for to go to a conference?
[2015-08-13 08:46:31] AnConio: Question, watching a video on how to create the test automation framework...and the author advocates the usage of static member and variables and classes...your opinions?
[2015-08-13 08:46:44] jimevans: heh. one of the conditions of coming to work for my current employer was that they pay for me to go to seconf in london. :)
[2015-08-13 08:47:04] AnConio: nice! wow
[2015-08-13 08:47:49] jimevans: actually, i was prepared that year to pay for it myself, but i wouldn't have had vacation time to take off, given my start date, so that was part of the negotiation.

[2015-08-13 08:48:55] AnConio: sure, that makes sense...the beginning of employment...gotta earn your "keep"

[2015-08-13 08:49:54] AnConio: I was originally slated to help get automation up here...and do all manual testing...1 tester and about 12, maybe a little less, developers
[2015-08-13 08:50:09] AnConio: that was the carrot that was dangled in front of me
[2015-08-13 08:50:22] AnConio: and i was pretty desperate to find a new job so I bit
[2015-08-13 08:50:43] AnConio: and they were adamant that I use Telerik's product
[2015-08-13 08:50:47] AnConio: Test Studio

[2015-08-13 08:51:48] jimevans: SimonConf 2015! i'm in!
[2015-08-13 08:51:53] AnConio: but whenever I tried suggesting a new product or some other tool they would always balk...no no no, we've already done all the analysis research and that's what we want...T's Test Studio
[2015-08-13 08:51:56] jimevans: oh, better make it 2016.

[2015-08-13 08:52:41] sircapsalot: haha
[2015-08-13 08:52:43] AnConio: it may not be so bad Jim but it's still record and playback
[2015-08-13 08:52:48] AnConio: and I want to write code
[2015-08-13 08:52:50] barancev, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-13 08:53:33] AnConio: but the real kicker is that I was supposed to get automation going "on my spare time" when I wasn't doing manual testing....of systems I was brand new to
[2015-08-13 08:53:54] jimevans: AnConio: i don't disagree. but then jim holmes (formerly of telerik) and i went round and round (good naturedly; i count him a friend) about that lots of times.

[2015-08-13 08:54:08] jimevans: oh that rarely pays off in the end
[2015-08-13 08:55:17] AnConio: recording is just too "hard coded" for me...and it was taking me hours to record a test...it felt ridiculous! I just wanted to write my own code to make it a little more flexible
[2015-08-13 08:55:47] AnConio: now I can  tell these devs, including the senior devs, had no clue what they were asking for or what they were pushing me into
[2015-08-13 08:56:33] sircapsalot1, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-13 08:56:44] AnConio: it amazed me how the devs were swooned by the record and playback carrot/donut :)
[2015-08-13 08:57:02] AnConio: when everything I read kept advising against said approach
[2015-08-13 08:57:29] AnConio: needless to say that 2 or 3 years later I still had nothing for them...well not much to show for it
[2015-08-13 08:59:24] AnConio: and only w/i  the last year, when I said screw it, I'm going w/ Selenium since I'll be the one dealing with this mess did I finally make progress
[2015-08-13 08:59:35] sircapsalot, quitting. (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[2015-08-13 08:59:37] AnConio: it also helps that we now have a testing team...not just me

[2015-08-13 09:00:16] yenaemj_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-13 09:01:29] AnConio: it just seemed the documentation and technical support was more forthcoming than that of Telerik's
[2015-08-13 09:01:58] AnConio: we've been paying for multiple licenses for multiple years for Telerik Test Studio...and marginally if ever actually use it
[2015-08-13 09:02:07] jimevans: i think that might be the first time we've ever been accused of having better docs and support than a commercial vendor (well docs, anyway)
[2015-08-13 09:02:35] AnConio: I keep objecting to it...but I'm told that just in case...so I think my employer is into spending money...or wasting some of it

[2015-08-13 09:03:59] jimevans: between simonstewart and i, we can get the grumpiness quotient pretty high sometimes.
[2015-08-13 09:04:40] AnConio: I actually think it goes w/ the job territory
[2015-08-13 09:05:08] AnConio: most IT folks I know aren't the happy go lucky telemarketer types
[2015-08-13 09:06:13] AnConio: anyway SeConf...let's see what they say

[2015-08-13 09:41:55] AnConio: Is there a new version of the InternetExplorerDriver? I've not used it in a few months but now my test won't even make it to the first page of my app
[2015-08-13 09:42:09] AnConio: IE does launch but that's it
[2015-08-13 09:42:21] AnConio: doesn't actually navigate anywhere

[2015-08-13 09:45:42] jimevans: but it's unlikely that would fix anything.

[2015-08-13 10:05:01] AnConio: as you predicted; same behavior w/ 2.44 or 2.47
[2015-08-13 10:08:27] jimevans: AnConio: https://gist.github.com/jimevans/fc421fd87269974b69d9
[2015-08-13 10:09:48] AnConio: alright, let me see if I can get that incorporated into my code

[2015-08-13 10:18:35] AnConio: jimevans, when instantiating my InternetExplorerDriver object, I have to specify both a service object and an InternetExplorerOptions object?
[2015-08-13 10:19:14] jimevans: you don't have to, unless you have options you want to specify.
[2015-08-13 10:19:26] kggr, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-13 10:19:33] jimevans: although now i think about it, the service-only constructor overload may have been added after 2.44.
[2015-08-13 10:19:43] AnConio: hmn, intellisense is telling me I have to
[2015-08-13 10:19:45] kggr, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2015-08-13 10:19:57] AnConio: ah!
[2015-08-13 10:20:04] jimevans: so add new InternetExplorerOption() to the constructor.
[2015-08-13 10:20:05] jimevans: :)
[2015-08-13 10:20:09] AnConio: let me revert to 2.44 and try again
[2015-08-13 10:20:23] jimevans: no, it won't matter what IEDriverServer version you're using.
[2015-08-13 10:20:35] jimevans: the language bindings may not have the constructor overload.
[2015-08-13 10:20:44] jimevans: it'll still work with IEDriverServer 2.47.
[2015-08-13 10:20:51] shawnknight, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-13 10:20:51] AnConio: something like  Instance = new InternetExplorerDriver(IEservice, new InternetExplorerOptions());
[2015-08-13 10:21:00] jimevans: yes, exactly so.
[2015-08-13 10:22:01] AnConio: where can I learn more about this InternetExplorerOptions usage?
[2015-08-13 10:22:21] jimevans: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-08-13 10:22:39] jimevans: the options is basically a type-safe replacement for using DesiredCapabilities.
[2015-08-13 10:22:47] jimevans: that's all
[2015-08-13 10:25:00] AnConio: yeah man but...again I'm still new to this...so, okay DesiredCapabilities is what to look up
[2015-08-13 10:25:42] jimevans: DesiredCapabilities is the way to set things like whether or not to use native events, setting a proxy for the browser, and so on.
[2015-08-13 10:26:15] AnConio: okay so the LogFile points to my zoom level being set to 75%

[2015-08-13 12:58:13] jimevans: kyoob: patches welcome. safari driver has no owner at the moment.
[2015-08-13 12:58:35] kyoob: ha. i can't even get my tests to work, you don't want me patching the actual driver
[2015-08-13 12:58:45] kyoob: my kung fu is weak
[2015-08-13 12:58:52] jimevans: not really my point.
[2015-08-13 12:58:59] sohlemac: Any chances of more spots opening for seconf?
[2015-08-13 12:59:23] jimevans: was more saying that the safari driver is largely unmaintained because no one has the time and/or inclination to keep it running.
[2015-08-13 13:00:29] kggr, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-13 13:03:16] kyoob: look i'm just curious if this has happened to anyone else, and if so whether they had a workaround

[2015-08-13 13:04:33] juangj: kyoob: i haven't encountered a problem like that, to my knowledge

[2015-08-13 13:04:48] jimevans: not stirring it, i'm just disappointed that no one has decided to really try to pick it up.
[2015-08-13 13:04:56] juangj: ... not that i'm admitting to knowing anything about the safaridriver
[2015-08-13 13:05:30] jimevans: and i get to say i'm disappointed, because i do have my own project contributions. :)
[2015-08-13 13:05:53] jimevans: a little thing called the IE driver takes up nearly all the time i have to devote to selenium.
[2015-08-13 13:06:54] kyoob: jimevans: i'd proudly take it on, with the caveat that i don't know what the heck i'm doing
[2015-08-13 13:07:51] juangj: jimevans: have you used the edge driver much? (i know you've used it at least some)
[2015-08-13 13:07:55] sircapsalot1: i've been looking into it jimevans.. trying to find myself an actual niche.  never really seeing the atom's before, it's taking a while
[2015-08-13 13:07:58] sircapsalot1, changing nick to sircapsalot.
[2015-08-13 13:08:12] jimevans: juangj: much? no not really. it's not fit for my purposes yet.
[2015-08-13 13:08:16] sircapsalot: even learning Closure for the first time :P
[2015-08-13 13:08:28] juangj: some fraction of my new session commands are met by an "unknown error", and i'm not sure what options i have besides just retrying
[2015-08-13 13:08:45] juangj: any idea if it writes out logs somewhere useful so that i could at least send something besides "unknown error" to MS?
[2015-08-13 13:09:10] jimevans: until edge driver supports finding elements via xpath, handling frames, and finding elements from an element as opposed to directly from the driver, it's not usable.
[2015-08-13 13:09:17] jimevans: for me, anyway.
[2015-08-13 13:09:39] juangj: i have use cases where loading a page and executing javascript are (barely) sufficient
[2015-08-13 13:09:48] juangj: but yeah, it's not usable for much else
[2015-08-13 13:10:27] jimevans: i haven't used it enough to have encountered failure of creating new sessions.

[2015-08-13 13:10:37] jimevans: if you can get a repro case, i'm quite sure MSFT would be interested
[2015-08-13 13:10:57] juangj: i guess i'll try to gather what i can and send it along
[2015-08-13 13:11:21] juangj: i tried to reproduce on another machine but windows 10 refuses to install on that machine
[2015-08-13 13:11:22] jimevans: juangj: you going to be at seconf?
[2015-08-13 13:11:31] juangj: i was thrilled to get the fabled "Something happened" error message, though!
[2015-08-13 13:11:39] jimevans: hah
[2015-08-13 13:11:48] juangj: not planning on seconf, no
[2015-08-13 13:12:12] jimevans: damn. coulda put you in a room with MSFT people at least partially responsible for edge driver.
[2015-08-13 13:12:22] jimevans: too bad,
[2015-08-13 13:13:04] juangj: hm. i mean, i could be convinced, though i heard recently from a reliable source that it was sold out
[2015-08-13 13:13:11] jimevans: :)
[2015-08-13 13:13:31] jimevans: unfortunately, edge driver is very much a black box.
[2015-08-13 13:13:54] kyoob: ah ha
[2015-08-13 13:13:57] dude-x: juangj: tickets may open up if people cancel, it automatically restocks
[2015-08-13 13:13:59] juangj: seva was convincing josh and i to go to sapporo instead of portland. though i feel like i should really spend more time reading and contributing to the spec (which i do actually want to do)
[2015-08-13 13:14:17] kyoob: a hardcoded 10 second stopwatch on safari launch and connect
[2015-08-13 13:15:54] jimevans: i'm very happy MSFT has shipped an implementation, and one that can be used directly with existing language bindings.
[2015-08-13 13:16:15] jimevans: i just want to be able to actually run the .NET webdriver tests against it start-to-finish.
[2015-08-13 13:16:18] juangj: i'm ecstatic!
[2015-08-13 13:16:54] juangj: in my dreams, sometimes i imagine Tim Cook "and one more thinging" safari webdriver support at a big press event
[2015-08-13 13:17:17] juangj: nobody said i was a realist
[2015-08-13 13:17:32] jimevans: hah. it'd be something if we were high enough profile to get that kind of press.

[2015-08-13 13:19:30] jimevans: or at least private-source.
[2015-08-13 13:20:03] jimevans: there are dependencies on trident internals, if i've heard properly.

[2015-08-13 14:07:15] juangj: yeah, i've tried email, selbot note, and bug
[2015-08-13 14:07:29] juangj: i figured just blanketing different communications media would find him somehow
[2015-08-13 14:08:15] juangj: i don't monitor this channel that closely so i always seem to miss him in here
[2015-08-13 14:08:40] jimevans: doesn't help that you're US west coast, and he's london. :)
[2015-08-13 14:08:48] juangj: yeah, and i get up kind of late

[2015-08-13 14:41:20] D3M0S: I thought so
[2015-08-13 14:41:45] D3M0S: But it's pretty advanced stuff, so I don't know if the audience was too excited about it

[2015-08-13 14:42:37] D3M0S: It sucks because I can't talk about advanced selenium stuff at my local opensource conferences
[2015-08-13 14:42:51] dude-x: at a prior job, we used spring to autowire the wrapper to webdriver
[2015-08-13 14:43:25] D3M0S: yeah, I'm using spring
[2015-08-13 14:43:48] dude-x: so i understand the usefulness of that. otherwise you'd  have to write more boilerplate in your tests
[2015-08-13 14:43:54] dude-x: but that being said, i hate writing java  :p
[2015-08-13 14:44:00] D3M0S: haha, I understand that
[2015-08-13 14:44:10] D3M0S: I'm becoming super jelly of C# generics
[2015-08-13 14:44:13] D3M0S: stupid type erasure
[2015-08-13 14:45:14] jimevans: C#, java done right since 2002
[2015-08-13 14:45:15] jimevans: :)
[2015-08-13 14:45:19] D3M0S: right now I'm working on using Java Lambdas to minimize some boiler plate in these really retarded tables that are all over my SUT
[2015-08-13 14:45:26] smyers, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-13 14:45:33] D3M0S: and yeah, those are pretty terrible compared to C# too
[2015-08-13 14:45:58] dude-x: at least you can use java 8
[2015-08-13 14:46:29] jimevans: c# generics and lambdas are much easier to deal with than java's, at least to my reading.
[2015-08-13 14:46:39] D3M0S: jimevans, you're not wrong

[2015-08-13 14:47:11] D3M0S: java: you like generics
[2015-08-13 14:47:12] jimevans: and the async/await stuff in c# 5.0 makes parallel coding so much easier to deal with in .NET
[2015-08-13 14:47:35] D3M0S: java: you like generics? well you'll need to generify your generics code to write generics
[2015-08-13 14:48:10] jimevans: yo dawg, i heard you like generics… :)

[2015-08-13 14:48:47] D3M0S: I've never had much of a problem with concurrency in java, but I haven't looked into it in C# .NET, I'm sure it's better in every way though.
[2015-08-13 14:49:14] jimevans: :yt 99 luftballons
[2015-08-13 14:49:29] dude-x: python 3.5 will have async/await as keywords to help you tag async functions
[2015-08-13 14:49:34] D3M0S: ofc my version of concurrency is locking down 1 browser to 1 thread and making sure 1 thread is tied to 1 test method
[2015-08-13 14:49:40] D3M0S: pretty simple to do
[2015-08-13 14:50:26] D3M0S: then I just depend on Jenkins and some config stuffs to run multiple browsers
[2015-08-13 14:50:28] dude-x: async won't help much for selenium stuff
[2015-08-13 14:51:02] D3M0S: yeah, that's developer land, something I beleive I get paid a lot to stay away from
[2015-08-13 14:51:51] D3M0S: Whaaaa? I can't use main?!?!?! better pay this guy a ton of money to deal with that stuff I'm more than capable of figuring out
[2015-08-13 14:52:04] D3M0S: I'm not complaining
