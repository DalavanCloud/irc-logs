[2015-08-19 09:19:04] smccarthy: WhereIsMySpoon: how many is "not all that many" ?
[2015-08-19 09:19:31] WhereIsMySpoon: smccarthy:uhh...3 projects, about 10 complete test cases per project
[2015-08-19 09:19:41] WhereIsMySpoon: one node
[2015-08-19 09:19:44] sircapsalot: jimevans ah cool!
[2015-08-19 09:20:17] smccarthy: nice, not too many at all
[2015-08-19 09:20:17] jimevans: sircapsalot: yeah, i'm channelling simonstewart this year, as his travel plans won't allow him to get in until sometime tuesday.
[2015-08-19 09:20:41] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: that's not many, and that's as it should be. :)
[2015-08-19 09:21:21] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: I'm slowly adding more :) but yea for P1s you dont want many as that then defeats the point of them being "P1s"
[2015-08-19 09:21:29] sircapsalot: ah, was he going to co-host that workshop
[2015-08-19 09:21:41] jimevans: he was going to run it, full stop.
[2015-08-19 09:21:50] WhereIsMySpoon: i may have to start moving some of the tests out of the p1 category to make sure it doesnt become too crowded
[2015-08-19 09:21:59] jimevans: i was floating to co-host that and the grid one.

[2015-08-19 12:12:32] santiycr1, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-08-19 12:12:50] lukeis: you mean like when you are on an https site and there's insecure assets? you want selenium to tell you that?
[2015-08-19 12:12:51] AutomatedTester: mlhamel: Selenium won't give you mixed content errors
[2015-08-19 12:13:01] mlhamel: that's kind of sad
[2015-08-19 12:13:12] mlhamel: yeah cause browser would report those errrors
[2015-08-19 12:13:16] mlhamel: on the console
[2015-08-19 12:13:22] mlhamel: i want to extract those errors
[2015-08-19 12:13:32] lukeis: you can possibly get the browser console (logs) and check for the message
[2015-08-19 12:13:51] mlhamel: lukeis get_log is expecting an argument
[2015-08-19 12:13:56] mlhamel: driver.get_log
[2015-08-19 12:14:03] lukeis: yeah, you have to pass a log type
[2015-08-19 12:14:05] mlhamel: that's the one you are talking about lukeis ?
[2015-08-19 12:14:11] lukeis: is that ruby?
[2015-08-19 12:14:50] mlhamel: python
[2015-08-19 12:15:09] lukeis: heh… one sec
[2015-08-19 12:15:17] mlhamel: i always got *** ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded
[2015-08-19 12:15:28] lukeis: d.log_types
[2015-08-19 12:15:47] lukeis: d.get_log('browser')  <- for firefox
[2015-08-19 12:16:30] lukeis: i don't know if phantomjs implements the logging as such… nor if phantom even does the mixed content error
[2015-08-19 12:17:35] mlhamel: oh oki
[2015-08-19 12:17:43] mlhamel: will digg more

[2015-08-19 12:19:10] fullstack: I'm in Selenium hell. ElementNotVisibleError: element not visible
[2015-08-19 12:19:33] fullstack: No matter what -- ... isDisplayed() is true -- when it isn't -- and it can't click, because it isn't visible.
[2015-08-19 12:19:37] fullstack: so it fails
[2015-08-19 12:19:44] jimevans: fullstack: you're trying to automate the UI of gmail?
[2015-08-19 12:19:59] fullstack: jimevans: Yeah its a unit test for confirming an email
[2015-08-19 12:20:03] jimevans: if so, do you work for google on the gmail team?
[2015-08-19 12:20:07] jimevans: if not, why?
[2015-08-19 12:20:14] jimevans: there are much better ways to handle email
[2015-08-19 12:20:18] smccarthy: fullstack:  it doesn't look like a unit test ;)
[2015-08-19 12:20:32] fullstack: It isn't a unit test its a Protractor step
[2015-08-19 12:20:41] jimevans: doesn't matter.
[2015-08-19 12:21:20] jimevans: if you're attempting to validate an email or its contents from your app, and you're attempting to do so by automating gmail's UI, You're Doing It Wrong ™
[2015-08-19 12:21:33] fullstack: Any suggestion?
[2015-08-19 12:21:38] smccarthy: fullstack: ask a fellow google employee ?
[2015-08-19 12:21:44] lukeis: my first google result…. :google selenium gmail
[2015-08-19 12:21:50] lukeis: dammit...
[2015-08-19 12:21:50] lukeis: http://yizeng.me/2014/07/19/why-you-shouldnt-start-learning-selenium-by-automating-googles-products/
[2015-08-19 12:23:18] jimevans: yes. don't do that. you should be able to use a mail protocol library to check gmail. something using pop3 or imap, i would imagine.
[2015-08-19 12:23:28] fullstack: So is there anyway to if element .isDisplay == or .. even if try to "try () catch{}" it fails
[2015-08-19 12:23:45] lukeis: jimevans: even better… google provides an API in almost all languages for gmail ;)
[2015-08-19 12:24:00] jimevans: yes, even better. :)
[2015-08-19 12:24:13] lukeis: fullstack: stop… turn around… try again. Do not automate gmail with Selenium unless you work at google!
[2015-08-19 12:25:08] alien_, quitting. (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[2015-08-19 12:25:28] fullstack: Ok So but does selenium isDisplayed() work on non-google products?
[2015-08-19 12:25:36] lukeis: yes
[2015-08-19 12:25:37] jimevans: fullstack: the problem isn't isDisplayed.
[2015-08-19 12:25:54] fullstack: why is ElementNotVisibleError fired -- BTW this isn't gmail
[2015-08-19 12:26:26] fullstack: why can't I check before click() if its visible or not.  This is with non-gooogle products on my web app
[2015-08-19 12:26:54] fullstack: If I use a REPL, and manually type element(by.css('#idorwhatever')).isDisplayed() it returns false
[2015-08-19 12:26:59] fullstack: On non-google products
[2015-08-19 12:26:59] jimevans: you should be able to. or at least in the raw javascript webdriver api you should be able to.
[2015-08-19 12:27:16] jimevans: protractor may do "other stuff"
[2015-08-19 12:27:17] fullstack: but when I put the REPL -- for non-google products -- code inside the Protractor step, it fails?
[2015-08-19 12:27:42] warfront1, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2015-08-19 12:27:43] lukeis: isDisplayed doesn't fail… the click fails, right?
[2015-08-19 12:27:55] fullstack: It returns true -- and click() proceeds
[2015-08-19 12:28:11] fullstack: but under REPL it returns false -- and the conditional statement wouldn't run
[2015-08-19 12:28:21] fullstack: same non-google page
[2015-08-19 12:28:34] jimevans: there's not nearly enough information here to give you a concrete answer for your particular case. in the general case, it works as you'd expect.
[2015-08-19 12:28:45] lukeis: we'd be able to help troubleshoot more if you provided a url or html to reproduce the issue
[2015-08-19 12:28:54] fullstack: Ok, let me try an example
[2015-08-19 12:29:01] sircapsalot, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-08-19 12:29:40] fullstack: <body><button id="#hide">free mcrib</button></body>, and #hide display:none  -- should do it right?
[2015-08-19 12:30:32] jimevans: i think you want class="hide" or similar
[2015-08-19 12:30:49] jimevans: again, i'm not dealing with angular or protractor.
[2015-08-19 12:30:55] jimevans: strip it down to bare essentials
[2015-08-19 12:31:01] fullstack: ok, class instead of ID. sure why not. Free McRib might be offensive as well
[2015-08-19 12:31:55] jimevans: sorry, i'm done here.
[2015-08-19 12:32:33] lukeis: seems like you assume selenium is fundamentally broken…. i can assure you there are many unit tests for selenium itself where this type of simple case is not going to fail

[2015-08-19 12:44:25] lukeis: "A promise that will be resolved with whether this element is currently visible on the page."
[2015-08-19 12:44:36] fullstack: question: how would I write it in raw Selenium webdriver to isolate it if its protractor? Sorry my background is with Angular/Protractor?
[2015-08-19 12:44:50] lukeis: "raw" selenium?
[2015-08-19 12:45:02] lukeis: you would need to say, with X other language
[2015-08-19 12:45:07] fullstack: yes, but if isDisplayed() isn't true -- it won't resolve a promise
[2015-08-19 12:45:14] fullstack: and return false?
[2015-08-19 12:45:30] lukeis: i think it will return a promise either way

[2015-08-19 15:03:26] fullstack: is there a way to force webdriver to wait for the page to be finish loading?
[2015-08-19 15:03:55] fullstack: because some AJAX stuff is running randomly -- and if I do something while its running -- the behavior is different then what I expect
[2015-08-19 15:04:15] lukeis: you should 'wait' for an element you know to exist when the page is done loading to be present / displayed
[2015-08-19 15:04:34] fullstack: Yeah this is in the background AJAX stuff that just randomly happens
[2015-08-19 15:04:41] fullstack: after my page is done loading
[2015-08-19 15:04:52] lukeis: not sure what the best mechanism in javascript is… but basically other languages poll for a state (with a long timeout)

[2015-08-19 15:06:17] fullstack: I need like "Is the page doing things with the server?" "yes" then wait, "no" "ok, then we're safe" -- but there is no HTML element to indicate that the page is doing things except for the browser "page loading icon"  itself
[2015-08-19 15:07:00] lukeis: what element do you expect to be on the page, that doesn't exist prior, that will exist after the loading icon is gone?  whatever that is, find that element until it exists
[2015-08-19 15:08:41] lukeis: there's a few too many ways (with all the various javascript frameworks out there) for selenium to 'detect' when an AJAX request is happening and when it's "done"… we can't do it generically for everyone, thus everyone needs to wait for their page's state to be what they expect it to be
