[2015-08-15 01:33:03] Ardesco: My experience is that chrome is usually faster than phantom and much easier to run multiple threads

[2015-08-15 09:06:48] Ardesco: if it’s using HTML5 dragover stuff you’ll probably need to write some JavaScript
[2015-08-15 09:07:29] iseedeadcode: can i write you a private message ?
[2015-08-15 09:07:47] Ardesco: may as well write it in this channel :)

[2015-08-15 09:08:24] Ardesco: You’ll need to look at the website code
[2015-08-15 09:08:48] Ardesco: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Drag_and_drop
[2015-08-15 09:08:56] Ardesco: it’s probably using CSS :hoever though

[2015-08-15 09:09:52] iseedeadcode: how do i implement javascript in selenium ?
[2015-08-15 09:09:53] Ardesco: this then https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/AdvancedUserInteractions
[2015-08-15 09:11:03] iseedeadcode: i have used it, is it javascript already or it's a part of selenium or java ?
[2015-08-15 09:11:24] Ardesco: To do JavaScript you’ll need to write you JavaScript code and then execute it using a JavaScript executor
[2015-08-15 09:11:25] Ardesco: http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/JavascriptExecutor.html

[2015-08-15 10:02:04] iseedeadcode: org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: Unable to locate element: {"method":"class name","selector":".rating_5"}

[2015-08-15 10:12:12] iseedeadcode: with this it should successfully find it ?
[2015-08-15 10:12:35] Ardesco: depends what you are trying to find
[2015-08-15 10:12:45] Ardesco: I would guess the hover class is only applied when you hover over it
[2015-08-15 10:13:04] iseedeadcode: yes
[2015-08-15 10:13:10] Ardesco: I would have thought .rating_5 would give you the 5th star
[2015-08-15 10:13:39] Ardesco: so if you use that selector before you have hovered over the element it will not find anything
[2015-08-15 10:13:55] iseedeadcode: rating_5 only opens the new rating menu where is 5 stars
[2015-08-15 10:13:56] Ardesco: if you hover over the element then that selector should start to work

[2015-08-15 11:49:16] Ardesco: if you have the 5th start and the hover class is applied when you hover over it and removed when you don’t hover over it
[2015-08-15 11:49:55] Ardesco: you can do a WebElement.getAttribute(“class”).contains(“hover”)
[2015-08-15 11:50:08] Ardesco: assuming there are no other classes applied that contain the word hover
[2015-08-15 11:50:25] iseedeadcode: there are 5 stars i assume all of them has it
[2015-08-15 11:50:51] Ardesco: Assume = Ass U Me
[2015-08-15 11:50:54] Ardesco: check!
[2015-08-15 11:51:21] iseedeadcode: each star gets hover class when you hover over it
[2015-08-15 11:51:36] Ardesco: but you are only hovering over 1 of the stars correct>
[2015-08-15 11:51:51] Ardesco: so you just need to check that the one you are hovering over gets it
[2015-08-15 11:51:53] iseedeadcode: yes, the fifth one
[2015-08-15 11:51:57] Ardesco: unless you are expecting them all to get it
[2015-08-15 11:52:06] Ardesco: in which case check that they all get the hover class
[2015-08-15 11:52:35] iseedeadcode: i need to check that all of them lit up
[2015-08-15 11:53:00] Ardesco: fin each element in turn then and check it has the hover class applied

[2015-08-15 11:57:56] iseedeadcode: after adding WebElement.getAttribute(“class”).contains(“hover”) it says i need to add argument to match
[2015-08-15 11:58:59] Ardesco: by WebElement
[2015-08-15 11:59:04] Ardesco: I mean the WebElement you found
[2015-08-15 11:59:10] Ardesco: e.g.
[2015-08-15 11:59:40] Ardesco: WebElement fifthStar = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(“.rating_5"));
[2015-08-15 11:59:56] Ardesco: fifthStar.getAttribute(“class”).contains(“hover”)
[2015-08-15 12:02:34] iseedeadcode: it runned and it passed does that mean I verified it ?
[2015-08-15 12:03:26] Ardesco: did you perform an assertiong that the final line was true?
[2015-08-15 12:03:31] Ardesco: *assertion
[2015-08-15 12:03:53] iseedeadcode: no:(
[2015-08-15 12:04:09] Ardesco: You’ll want somethign like hamcrest
[2015-08-15 12:04:10] Ardesco: https://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/wiki/Tutorial
[2015-08-15 12:10:55] iseedeadcode: i don't understand how can i assert it to my stars having hover class, in tutorial they only use they own created variables
[2015-08-15 12:11:41] Ardesco: Boolean isHoverAppliedToFifthStar = fifthStar.getAttribute(“class”).contains(“hover”);
[2015-08-15 12:12:21] Ardesco: assertThat(isHoverAppliedToFifthStar, is(equalTo(true)));
[2015-08-15 12:12:49] Ardesco: you could just stick  fifthStar.getAttribute(“class”).contains(“hover”) into the matcher without the additional variable if you want
[2015-08-15 12:13:11] Ardesco: you can also System.out.println() it to display what the result is in the console
[2015-08-15 12:13:35] Ardesco: or without using hamcrest matchers you can just do a simple assert using jUnit or TestNG
[2015-08-15 12:14:05] iseedeadcode: i am runing them in jUnit
[2015-08-15 12:14:22] Ardesco: I would really suggest starting with AutomatedTester’s book  It will teach you how to do all of this stuff
[2015-08-15 12:14:42] Ardesco: https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/selenium-2-testing-tools-beginner’s-guide

[2015-08-15 12:15:46] Ardesco: I think with jUnit it’s assertTrue(<conditionHere>)
[2015-08-15 12:16:03] Ardesco: Why is it so important to get this done quickly ?
[2015-08-15 12:17:06] iseedeadcode: it's for job interview. I can't let this oppurtinity to pass. I know it's probably sounds bad, if you consider the fact that I am bad :) but i have motivation to work hard, only need to get the job and then it would be learning marathon.
[2015-08-15 12:21:57] iseedeadcode: in fact i think i am already at 16 hour :)
[2015-08-15 12:23:12] iseedeadcode: i did this is this enough of verification ? assertTrue(fifthstar.getAttribute("class").contains("hover"));
