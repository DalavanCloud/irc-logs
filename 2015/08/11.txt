[2015-08-11 03:45:18] pauluchon: What is the strategy for handling alert? I'm trying to add a fluent wait for alert, but In the stack trace I don't see calls to my wait, it simply throws an exception when alert is open if I don't do acceptAlert.
[2015-08-11 03:45:19] pauluchon: And if I just call acceptAlert, I have issues with IE which is slower and it calls acceptAlert before alert is shown so I have the noAlertPresent exception..

[2015-08-11 07:54:01] WhereIsMySpoon: Guest13089: you should be using WebDriver

[2015-08-11 09:09:54] AnConio: so I kind of had "gained" a lot of knowledge before I got here...but I still wish I'd come accross this channel a lot earlier than I did

[2015-08-11 09:11:24] barancev: lukeis: I'm self-employed so I can have a long vacation ;) but not too long.
[2015-08-11 09:11:24] AnConio: so anyway, thank you barancev

[2015-08-11 09:13:45] AnConio: so on to my question....and I'm sure it's not a new one...maybe even a heated one...Assertions, to Assert or not to Assert w/i the POM vs. the test?
[2015-08-11 09:13:49] barancev: Guest13089: show the command you use to start the test
[2015-08-11 09:14:10] barancev: or the project settings in IDE
[2015-08-11 09:14:21] barancev: or how else did you configured the classpath
[2015-08-11 09:14:45] Guest13089: running in eclipse

[2015-08-11 09:15:57] WhereIsMySpoon: not many of them but theyre there
[2015-08-11 09:16:02] WhereIsMySpoon: i believe Dave_B_ does too
[2015-08-11 09:16:31] AnConio: yeah, to me it just seems "natural" do place them w/i the POMs...but I've read that's a "bad practice"
[2015-08-11 09:16:32] Guest13089: different error with just the server.jar on the classpath

[2015-08-11 09:17:16] AnConio: otherwise my tests need to "know" about my POM properties...so I have to make my fields/properties public
[2015-08-11 09:17:22] WhereIsMySpoon: AnConio: yep
[2015-08-11 09:18:09] Guest13089: debug config classpath contains the .jar
[2015-08-11 09:18:09] AnConio: so I'm guessing that in reality you have Assertions in both your tests AND your POMs?
[2015-08-11 09:20:11] Guest13089: http://pastie.org/10344244
[2015-08-11 09:20:22] Dave_B_: *most* of my assertions are in my tests
[2015-08-11 09:20:26] Dave_B_: but some are in my POM
[2015-08-11 09:20:35] Guest13089: server .jar only gives notConnectedException
[2015-08-11 09:21:09] Dave_B_: tho being in python I tend to take a 'all things are accessible' approach so not got a 'do i expose my fields/properties etc' question

[2015-08-11 09:28:09] AnConio: the label says there should be zero results displaying initially
[2015-08-11 09:28:44] AnConio: not until the user starts selecting various other fields and values do results in the grid get displayed

[2015-08-11 10:59:43] AnConio: I guess the hang up is on what one calls an "Assertion"
[2015-08-11 10:59:55] titusfortner: If the form page won't even load, you don't know if your code will allow the form to be submitted
[2015-08-11 11:00:14] AnConio: titus seems to be defining an Assertion was what the Test is trying to confirm/verify
[2015-08-11 11:00:39] titusfortner: yeah, for me it is making sure the assertion library stays in the test
[2015-08-11 11:00:45] AnConio: so by that definition...it should be limited to exist solely in the TEST itself
[2015-08-11 11:01:12] titusfortner: Doesn't mean you can't put them in PO, but I think it confuses intent, and that's one of the most important things for testing
[2015-08-11 11:01:29] AnConio: and that does make sense...but does make for a cleaner separation of concerns...however there are certain "things" that should be/exist prior to starting a test

[2015-08-11 12:26:03] simonstewart: You can't use "response.addCookie", but you can set the header directly
[2015-08-11 12:26:25] fullstack: Is it possible to set a breakpoint/watch in chromdev tools and then if selenium hits that spot, pause for me or do something?
[2015-08-11 12:26:35] simonstewart: response.setHeader("Set-Cookie", "name=value;HttpOnly")
[2015-08-11 12:26:38] simonstewart: Something like that
[2015-08-11 12:26:45] fullstack: Like, Selenium would open up the chrome dev tools dialog, set a breakpoint (man dunno who this would work..) and then continue on
[2015-08-11 12:27:17] simonstewart: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.2.6
[2015-08-11 12:27:28] jimevans: fullstack: i'd imagine probably not. in fact, i'd imagine that'd break things pretty spectacularly, assuming chromedriver still uses the remote debugging protocol (which last i heard, could only maintain one client connected at a time).
[2015-08-11 12:28:01] fullstack: Well.. my issue is that I have some code that sporatically breaks... and I can't seem to trace it
[2015-08-11 12:28:08] simonstewart: jimevans, but watch out for: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.4
[2015-08-11 12:28:09] jimevans: simonstewart: isn't that what Response.addCookie is supposed to do? :)
[2015-08-11 12:28:30] fullstack: Like if I run it 30 times, it breaks once. Then if I'm lucky I can look around

[2015-08-11 12:29:49] jimevans: i was just kinda hoping someone who had the cycles and had worked in that code before could quickly do whatever needed to be done to make it happen. :)
[2015-08-11 12:29:54] fullstack: I noticed that also. As soon as I open up devtools, *kaboom*
[2015-08-11 12:30:17] simonstewart: I now know how to create an httponly cookie. Who wants it? And why?
[2015-08-11 12:31:13] fullstack: is there a DevTools API that Selenium can access? Let Set breakpoint? Its the same backend, rgith?
[2015-08-11 12:31:38] jimevans: simonstewart: drivers should support retrieving them, according to the json wire protocol wiki page (and the spec, maybe?). the IE driver *should* now support that functionality, but i can't validate that in CI because the test web server doesn't return those cookies. :)
[2015-08-11 12:32:19] jimevans: so to answer your questions, i want it, so that i can run the appropriate webdriver tests against IE.

[2015-08-11 12:35:10] simonstewart: start building one
[2015-08-11 12:35:25] jimevans: oh, there's already a java test for this particular feature. it's just ignored. :)
[2015-08-11 12:36:01] titusfortner: fullstack: I'm assuming most IDEs let you set breakpoints, but almost everything I've done has been in Ruby with RubyMine, so I can't speak to others
[2015-08-11 12:36:03] *jleyba votes for using golang for a conformance suite b/c he wants to write go. everyone should ignore him since he probably won't write code for selenium again any time soon'

[2015-08-11 12:53:50] ato: OperaDriver also supported it.  It's not hard to support.
[2015-08-11 12:54:25] ato: Presto-Opera insisted that the browser initiated the connection for security reasons, unless you instrumented the profile.
[2015-08-11 12:54:37] simonstewart: But I think that only the IE driver could connect to a browser that webdriver didn't start
[2015-08-11 12:54:48] ato: So you had to go to a special page (opera:debug, a privileged content page) to connect to the remote.
[2015-08-11 12:55:10] jimevans: the IE driver never exposed that functionality, but in theory, yeah, it could've been made to do so.
[2015-08-11 12:55:38] titusfortner: It was one of the main advantages of the original watir
[2015-08-11 12:55:58] titusfortner: some people still refusing to upgrade to webdriver backed watir as a result. :)
[2015-08-11 12:56:10] jimevans: don't get me started on the watir community.
[2015-08-11 12:56:15] titusfortner: lol

[2015-08-11 12:56:48] jimevans: i'm still extraordinarily bitter that a leader in that community called the IE driver "shitty," with no offer of help to fix it.

[2015-08-11 12:58:22] jleyba: titusfortner, jimevans has been the IE guy for a few years.  since he saw what simon wrote and went "that looks fun"
[2015-08-11 12:58:46] jimevans: titusfortner: i rewrote the IE driver starting in 2010.
[2015-08-11 12:59:11] AutomatedTester: jimevans: sorry, didnt mean to draw you into drama. it was a genuine question
[2015-08-11 12:59:14] titusfortner: Ok, yeah, for a long time, then. The conversion of Watir to using Webdriver was sure a weird one

[2015-08-11 14:35:29] AutomatedTester: auto_sam: I had a CS degree but I didnt start with this career
[2015-08-11 14:35:44] AutomatedTester: actually my degree put me off any direct programming jobs

[2015-08-11 14:38:09] auto_sam: AutomatedTester, that's interesting thanks for your 2¢.  I first started using selenium to scrape public company metrics
[2015-08-11 14:38:32] AutomatedTester: auto_sam: fwiw most of my reports dont have CS Degrees

[2015-08-11 14:39:39] dude-x: auto_sam: after a year of unemployment and being rejected from several developer positions because i was too green, someone told me about automated testing as a QA tester is a way to get a foot in the door
[2015-08-11 14:40:00] jimevans: mine starts back two weeks prior, plus i'm moving the week before. :-/
[2015-08-11 14:40:41] auto_sam: AutomatedTester, that's awesome.  I did econ myself.  Right now I'm only proficient with python (plus mysql and a little js)... I've been meaning to branch out to another language

[2015-08-11 14:42:43] auto_sam: dude-x, that's the feedback I've been getting talking to people casually, i.e. apply to testiung before dev
[2015-08-11 14:42:47] octomeow: auto_sam, i was a sysadmin (with a bit of coding), then my friend helped me to move to Canada and offered a job in QA
[2015-08-11 14:43:05] AutomatedTester: auto_sam: don't use QA as a footing into dev
[2015-08-11 14:43:16] AutomatedTester: auto_sam: QA and Dev are two separate skill sets
[2015-08-11 14:43:24] auto_sam: AutomatedTester, do you work for mozilla?
[2015-08-11 14:43:28] AutomatedTester: auto_sam: I do
[2015-08-11 14:43:29] octomeow: auto_sam, and they knew I am coding so I was doing mostly automation here
[2015-08-11 14:43:54] octomeow: i'm no QA, too short of an attention span
[2015-08-11 14:44:09] auto_sam: i basically want to work with more nerds and less bros
[2015-08-11 14:44:16] AutomatedTester: the venn of QA and Dev can be 2 separate circles
[2015-08-11 14:44:30] octomeow: AutomatedTester, sadly
[2015-08-11 14:44:51] AutomatedTester: auto_sam: um... unfortunately tech industry is full of bros
[2015-08-11 14:44:56] octomeow: but I was working on moving these two circles closer for my team
[2015-08-11 14:45:18] octomeow: and now that I'm leaving them, they'll have to maximize that overlapping region
[2015-08-11 14:46:24] kyoob: unless you're automating with perl. no bro's there.
[2015-08-11 14:46:34] auto_sam: AutomatedTester, yeah i guess the grass is always greener.  right now i work in a small office and am the only one with any kind of technical expertise so the bro/nerd dichotomy is probably wider in my mind than reality
[2015-08-11 14:48:14] auto_sam: thanks for the opinions everyone
[2015-08-11 14:49:22] octomeow: and for the said dichotomy - just 2 years ago I would not accept a person with no knowledge in CS as my SO
[2015-08-11 14:49:48] octomeow: now I don't give a damn
