[2015-08-26 04:35:55] Alex11223: With Selenium WebDriver (Firefox or Chrome) is it possible to have multiple browser instances (that is multiple WebDriver instances?) and use different proxy for each of them?
[2015-08-26 04:36:26] CTtpollard: each instance is a standalone instance
[2015-08-26 04:37:40] Alex11223: so they can have different proxy settings? I thought that these settings are usually "global" in browsers

[2015-08-26 08:55:24] aimmac23: what I'd guess is that your selenium session didn't startup properly, which threw an exception
[2015-08-26 08:55:40] aimmac23: and that exception has been caught by testng, and its trying to take a screenshot
[2015-08-26 08:55:49] aimmac23: but failing, 'cause the selenium session didn't startup

[2015-08-26 09:01:02] aimmac23: unfortunately, I'm not all that familiar with using XML-based TestNG - I've only used it in pure-Java mode
[2015-08-26 09:01:38] aimmac23: if you can, I suggest copying the implementation of com.thoughtworks.selenium.ScreenshotListener with your own implementation, which has more logging
[2015-08-26 09:01:55] aimmac23: and substitute your own version in your XML config file
[2015-08-26 09:02:33] aimmac23: the ITestResult object probably contains the reason for the error

[2015-08-26 09:05:42] aimmac23: the root cause is probably a web browser failing to startup, or something

[2015-08-26 10:00:04] amigo__: It is in Python
[2015-08-26 10:00:24] WhereIsMySpoon: amigo__: dont ever mix implicit with explicit
[2015-08-26 10:00:27] WhereIsMySpoon: else this shit happens
[2015-08-26 10:00:33] WhereIsMySpoon: amigo__: dont use implicit waits
[2015-08-26 10:00:54] amigo__: and I know why it is happening... I think...
[2015-08-26 10:00:58] dude-x:  amigo__ either rewrite your explict waits to disable implicit waits, or strictly use explicit waits
[2015-08-26 10:01:23] amigo__: How can I do this >>either rewrite your explict waits to disable implicit waits<<
[2015-08-26 10:01:36] amigo__: how to disable implicit waits?
[2015-08-26 10:01:46] amigo__: always set in in driver to 0?
[2015-08-26 10:01:48] WhereIsMySpoon: remove the code that you set it
[2015-08-26 10:01:56] dude-x: same way you enable them, set it to 0
[2015-08-26 10:02:00] WhereIsMySpoon: you have to actually write code to set it to 30 secs
[2015-08-26 10:02:09] amigo__: true
[2015-08-26 10:02:12] WhereIsMySpoon: so remove that line

[2015-08-26 10:04:48] amigo__: This is good enough for me!
[2015-08-26 10:06:00] amigo__: I was just wandering why code executes if my get('URL') didn't finish to load the page? Is it possible to control somehow?
[2015-08-26 10:06:41] dude-x: godzirra, give up using javascript and write the tests in python?
[2015-08-26 10:06:42] amigo__: Page still loading but code below get('URL') is already running... kind of strange for me, or it is ok?
[2015-08-26 10:07:31] dude-x: only a few people here write tests in javascript
[2015-08-26 10:07:41] sircapsalot: what's a "javascript"?
[2015-08-26 10:08:00] amigo__: I started with Java, but ten I switched to python. And I like it.
[2015-08-26 10:08:03] dude-x: amigo__: you need to add a wait for an element that indicates that the page is loaded

[2015-08-26 10:09:11] godzirra: dude-x: Not useful, unfortunately. :/
[2015-08-26 10:09:23] dude-x: amigo__: yes...
[2015-08-26 10:09:36] dude-x: it could be an element that is displayed, or an element that is present
[2015-08-26 10:09:51] amigo__: Ok.... got it! Thank you! Will do so...
[2015-08-26 10:09:59] amigo__: Thank you dude-x!
[2015-08-26 10:10:23] dude-x: if you use firefox, with firebug, it can highlight DOM changes
[2015-08-26 10:10:38] dude-x: that can give you a clue as to what is the last element modified where you can wait on
[2015-08-26 10:11:35] amigo__: Thank you dude-x! I got the idea. I will handle it.
[2015-08-26 10:12:35] richdownie, quitting. (Quit: richdownie)
[2015-08-26 10:12:48] amigo__: So, it is always implicit wait on normal test flow and in special places implicit_wait = 0 and check everything with explicit_wait. Right?

[2015-08-26 13:15:02] AnConio: thanks jleyba, I was going about it the wrong way
[2015-08-26 13:15:15] dude-x: what was the wrong way
[2015-08-26 13:15:32] jleyba: xpath
[2015-08-26 13:15:43] AnConio: yep
[2015-08-26 13:16:01] dude-x: xpath would work the same i think but potentially slower
[2015-08-26 13:16:57] dude-x: /div[@title="blah"]
[2015-08-26 13:17:21] dude-x: xpath also allows contains, which css lacks
[2015-08-26 13:17:25] AnConio: actually it was working but not quite as I wanted it to...it was clicking on a <area> element but the wrong one since the username I was using for the tests doesn't have the same visibility as an "admin"
[2015-08-26 13:18:05] AnConio: so it was clicking on the 2nd <area> element..regardless of what it's title or alt attributes were saying
[2015-08-26 13:18:40] dude-x: yeah that's more of a user error/env error
[2015-08-26 13:18:42] AnConio: *its

[2015-08-26 13:30:45] Citizenken: 1? what do you mean
[2015-08-26 13:31:11] dude-x: if you run ifconfig
[2015-08-26 13:31:17] dude-x: how many things are bounded
[2015-08-26 13:31:38] Citizenken: yeah i have one ip, bounded to eth0

[2015-08-26 13:31:49] dude-x: or other stuff
[2015-08-26 13:32:10] Citizenken: a local loopback

[2015-08-26 13:32:31] dude-x: so console doesn't show any nodes?
[2015-08-26 13:32:42] Citizenken: nope
[2015-08-26 13:32:42] dude-x: what about the server
[2015-08-26 13:32:51] dude-x: how many network devices are listed
[2015-08-26 13:33:02] Citizenken: i'm using the same machine as a hub/node
[2015-08-26 13:33:13] dude-x: oh.
[2015-08-26 13:33:15] Citizenken: or trying to, since using a dedicated node wasn't working
[2015-08-26 13:33:42] dude-x: so your hub has --role hub, and your node has --role node rigth/
[2015-08-26 13:33:50] Citizenken: yup
[2015-08-26 13:33:58] dude-x: does the server have any webbrowsers you can run?
[2015-08-26 13:34:10] dude-x: the AWS Server
[2015-08-26 13:34:35] Citizenken: the server has firefox, for headless selenium
[2015-08-26 13:35:07] dude-x: and xvfb?
[2015-08-26 13:35:57] Citizenken: no, is that needed for firefox headless?
[2015-08-26 13:36:34] dude-x: you're going to need X
[2015-08-26 13:36:56] dude-x: firefox needs to render to an X window server of some sort
[2015-08-26 13:37:05] dude-x: like xvfb for "headless" operation
[2015-08-26 13:37:06] Citizenken: ah ojk
[2015-08-26 13:37:10] Citizenken: one sec
[2015-08-26 13:39:06] Citizenken: can i just which that to confirm it is installed?
[2015-08-26 13:40:43] Citizenken: ok, looks like its installed
[2015-08-26 13:41:21] dude-x: since you have only firefox installed (presumably)
[2015-08-26 13:41:35] dude-x: you should pass the parameter --browser firefox to the node
[2015-08-26 13:42:24] Citizenken: yep, still nothing in the console
