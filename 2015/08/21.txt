[2015-08-21 09:49:39] titusfortner: Is MS maintaining the Java bindings as well? Or just the driver issues?
[2015-08-21 09:49:47] titusfortner: Didn't they write a lot of it to start with?
[2015-08-21 09:50:00] p_l: titusfortner: each driver exports the same interface
[2015-08-21 09:50:18] titusfortner: Right, I had issues implementing execute_script in Ruby with Edge
[2015-08-21 09:50:28] titusfortner: I was told last week that other bindings figured it out
[2015-08-21 09:50:47] brma, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-21 09:51:11] jimevans: titusfortner: if you're properly sending the code across the wire using the protocol, and it's not working, that's a bug in the driver.
[2015-08-21 09:52:01] titusfortner: As I recall, I was passing the toggle the same way I do with Chrome, but it wasn't returning it as an option the same way Chrome did.
[2015-08-21 09:52:28] jimevans: you mean in the capabilities when starting a session?
[2015-08-21 09:52:29] titusfortner: It's been a few weeks, I need to try again
[2015-08-21 09:52:31] titusfortner: yeah
[2015-08-21 09:52:57] titusfortner: I'm finally figuring out how to automatically run all the Ruby tests in a CI on every commit
[2015-08-21 09:53:11] jimevans: do the ruby bindings actually check the capability when attempting to call execute_script?
[2015-08-21 09:53:50] titusfortner: I was checking the output of setting up the capabilities, and the setting wasn't present.
[2015-08-21 09:54:57] jimevans: i'm confused.
[2015-08-21 09:55:03] titusfortner: but maybe it is a desired/required capabilities mixup, or something else I didn't do. I was coding all night to get it into the release, so I'm sure I could have missed something
[2015-08-21 09:55:23] titusfortner: whatever. not important. I'll try again, and ask again if I can't figure it out on a second attempt. :)
[2015-08-21 09:56:03] jimevans: when you say you were having trouble, were you having trouble actually calling the execute_script method, or just examining the returned capabilities from the new session call?
[2015-08-21 09:56:13] titusfortner: Yes, execute_script failed
[2015-08-21 09:56:27] titusfortner: and when debugging I saw that it wasn't returned after I explicitly set it the way I do with Chrome driver
[2015-08-21 09:56:41] titusfortner: (it == the capability)

[2015-08-21 10:00:26] voodoofish430: heya folks, is there a selenium driver  or recommended way to test rest endpoints using csharp?
[2015-08-21 10:00:50] brma, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-08-21 10:00:59] jimevans: voodoofish430: why would you use selenium? i'd just use an HttpWebRequest and be done with it.
[2015-08-21 10:01:58] voodoofish430: jimevans: well, thats why I'm asking, to see if it's just recommended to do something like httpwebrequest...  :) hence the "recommended way" part of my question...
[2015-08-21 10:04:55] dude-x: voodoofish430: rest endpoints? just use an http client. also look into a json schema validation library
[2015-08-21 10:05:28] dubner_, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-08-21 10:08:55] sircapsalot: voodoofish430 definitely the recommended way to go, is something "other" than Selenium :)  Selenium should be used if you are automating a front-end.  a REST API is back-end
[2015-08-21 10:08:56] voodoofish430: righto, thanks dude-x and jimevans
[2015-08-21 10:10:18] voodoofish430: sircapsalot: right, so I was just currious if there was an APIDriver that was made for doing something like that or again, just use the httpwebrequest method..
[2015-08-21 10:11:18] sircapsalot: something like JMeter or SOAP UI is what you want
[2015-08-21 10:11:43] sircapsalot: or just keep-it-simple and use just httpwebrequest, sure
[2015-08-21 10:12:54] voodoofish430: sircapsalot: yeah, I'm trying to keep it in the app test solution so I'd rather not go with other external apps, though I've used jmeter for testing of things like this before so.

[2015-08-21 11:08:55] jimevans: i mean, there's a valid point there. i'd like nothing better than to make that particular capability the default. *but* it's a change in default behavior, and people really tend to hate that.
[2015-08-21 11:09:04] titusfortner: In Ruby I just tell people to monkey patch the class if they want something different by default. :)
[2015-08-21 11:09:22] jimevans: titusfortner: that's a little harder to do when the driver in question is in C++. :)
[2015-08-21 11:09:29] titusfortner: right. :)
[2015-08-21 11:09:45] juangj: in fact, let's make a fake account with an open-secret password so that people can sock-puppet it as the a-hole account

[2015-08-21 11:39:56] sircapsalot: I just got what you meant jimevans.. earlier I had noticed you said something about "is he going to be at seconf", and "snark".. I was in a meeting so i couldn't read context :)
[2015-08-21 11:40:09] sircapsalot: i saw he was from portland

[2015-08-21 11:45:16] juangj: that's regular internet-stalking, not doxxing
[2015-08-21 11:45:21] sircapsalot: HA
[2015-08-21 11:45:27] sircapsalot: and no.. i just went to his profile

[2015-08-21 15:04:50] stephend: yeah
[2015-08-21 15:05:35] lukeis: i'll try to see if I can make itâ€¦ wife might not be happy with me, the next night is the dreamforce gala (foo fighters are playing ;) )
[2015-08-21 15:05:46] stephend: lukeis: it'll be both live-streamed and recorded/archived :-)
[2015-08-21 15:05:52] stephend: I like that mozilla does that

[2015-08-21 15:15:01] stephend: looks like you found a Python exception/HTTP 500/traceback
[2015-08-21 15:15:05] lukeis: ahâ€¦ umm, i logged a bug, haven't gone much further
[2015-08-21 15:15:19] stephend: mind cc:ing me? stephen.donner@gmail.com
[2015-08-21 15:15:27] lukeis: sure thingâ€¦

[2015-08-21 15:19:16] lukeis: of course I'm not pursuing this whole thing too heavily since AutomatedTester may be working on the 'whole signing' issue from a different angleâ€¦ not sure what outcome may occur

[2015-08-21 15:37:29] joshbruning: cool - I'd enjoy meeting people face-to-face sometime, so feel free to give me a heads up
[2015-08-21 15:38:07] lukeis: well, this one is one week after selenium conf, but will apparently have some people from mozilla that won't be attending the conference

[2015-08-21 23:16:11] joshbruning: Does it work fine if you don't set it in the profile, but navigate to the about:config page and toggle it there?
[2015-08-21 23:19:45] gardinal: No. Still doesn't work fine. It randomly forces amazon to show the older layout at times, but more often than not shows the uglier broken layout.
[2015-08-21 23:20:09] gardinal: Whilst, ff sans webdriver with js disabled always shows the older layout.
[2015-08-21 23:20:20] joshbruning: And javascript.enabled = true is a frozen value ... and the Firefox WebDriver extension executes javascript. https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/firefox-driver/webdriver.json
[2015-08-21 23:21:11] gardinal: I even used it with noscript extension for ff.
[2015-08-21 23:22:11] gardinal: Yes, setting it from profile didn't work makes sense. But noscript and manual config did work. JS wasn't executing, but still amazon wasn't behaving gracefully.
[2015-08-21 23:22:46] joshbruning: I see - so you instructed Firefox to install noscript extension as well.
[2015-08-21 23:23:01] joshbruning: Firefox 39 or 40?
[2015-08-21 23:23:24] b0nn, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-21 23:23:34] gardinal: Yes, I was trying things . I was working on 40. Then tried 34 too.
[2015-08-21 23:26:41] gardinal: selenium 2.47 right now
[2015-08-21 23:31:17] joshbruning: I see. Well, I was under the impression that running without JavaScript would break functionality. I'm most familiar w/ Chrome, though.
[2015-08-21 23:31:27] joshbruning: Good luck - heading out.
[2015-08-21 23:32:07] gardinal: okay, thanks anyway.
[2015-08-21 23:57:21] gardinal: anyone?
