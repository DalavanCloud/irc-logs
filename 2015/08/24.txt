[2015-08-24 06:14:03] GforOevOerD:  sircapsalot Thanks for the answer. So, is it same as a code locating an element *by class name
[2015-08-24 06:14:38] WhereIsMySpoon: sircapsalot: i think you might have jumped the gun
[2015-08-24 06:14:49] WhereIsMySpoon: GforOevOerD: the By class provides several ways to locate an element
[2015-08-24 06:14:58] WhereIsMySpoon: there is By.cssSelector, By.xpath, By.id, By.name etc
[2015-08-24 06:15:08] WhereIsMySpoon: u can use any of these to locate an element by any means you wnat
[2015-08-24 06:15:21] WhereIsMySpoon: mostly you should use either id or css
[2015-08-24 06:15:41] GforOevOerD: WhereIsMySpoon Oh, thank you!

[2015-08-24 06:16:07] GforOevOerD: WhereIsMySpoon It's the same as elem = find_element_by_id(some_id)
[2015-08-24 06:16:24] WhereIsMySpoon: GforOevOerD: yes then you would do driver.findElement(By.id("some_id"))
[2015-08-24 06:16:28] GforOevOerD: or the same as elem = find_element_by_xpath(some xpath)
[2015-08-24 06:16:54] GforOevOerD: WhereIsMySpoon I understood, thank you so much

[2015-08-24 10:01:39] WhereIsMySpoon: clarkenciel: the general way to deal with upload fields is just to sendKeys/send_keys to them with the the full filepath
[2015-08-24 10:01:48] WhereIsMySpoon: and NOT to click them
[2015-08-24 10:03:33] clarkenciel: I've tried that: no dice. There isn't an input field with Dropzone.
[2015-08-24 10:03:51] WhereIsMySpoon: ok i have no idea what dropzone is so..sorry
[2015-08-24 10:03:53] clarkenciel: It's just a div with an event listener
[2015-08-24 10:04:30] WhereIsMySpoon: clarkenciel: and what does that event do
[2015-08-24 10:04:40] WhereIsMySpoon: if you say open a file browser im going to be unhapy
[2015-08-24 10:04:40] jleyba: if you're doing a file upload, there must be a <input type=file> somewhere on the apge
[2015-08-24 10:04:42] WhereIsMySpoon: unhappy*
[2015-08-24 10:04:42] jleyba: page*
[2015-08-24 10:05:01] jleyba: that element is what you need to send the key events to
[2015-08-24 10:05:08] clarkenciel: WhereIsMySpoon: yeah it does that, unfortunately.
[2015-08-24 10:05:17] WhereIsMySpoon: way to reinvent the wheel
[2015-08-24 10:05:23] WhereIsMySpoon: /eyeroll
[2015-08-24 10:05:51] clarkenciel: jleyba: well one does appear...after you've uploaded the file
[2015-08-24 10:06:10] WhereIsMySpoon: jleyba: http://www.dropzonejs.com/
[2015-08-24 10:06:45] clarkenciel: what it seems to do (having not read Dz's source) is upload the file to AWS (or similar) and then create an input on the page with a link to that version of the file.
[2015-08-24 10:07:02] WhereIsMySpoon: this is ridiculous
[2015-08-24 10:07:10] WhereIsMySpoon: what a silly piece of overengineering
[2015-08-24 10:07:35] WhereIsMySpoon: clarkenciel: you cannot interact with system dialogs using selenium
[2015-08-24 10:07:41] jleyba: document.querySelector('input[type=file]')
[2015-08-24 10:07:41] clarkenciel: right
[2015-08-24 10:07:41] WhereIsMySpoon: you're gonna have to find another way to deal with it
[2015-08-24 10:07:53] jleyba: ^ that happily returns a file element
[2015-08-24 10:08:10] WhereIsMySpoon: true
[2015-08-24 10:08:10] jleyba: (looking at www.dropzonejs.com)
[2015-08-24 10:08:11] WhereIsMySpoon: actually
[2015-08-24 10:08:13] WhereIsMySpoon: <input type="file" multiple="multiple" class="dz-hidden-input" style="visibility: hidden; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; height: 0px; width: 0px;">
[2015-08-24 10:08:21] clarkenciel: well I've found a bit of javascript that uploads to it, until I run it in selenium.
[2015-08-24 10:08:43] WhereIsMySpoon: clarkenciel: driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input[type='file']")).sendKeys(myFilename)
[2015-08-24 10:08:47] jleyba: WebElement el = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input[type=file]");
[2015-08-24 10:09:07] clarkenciel: I'll try those. Thanks!
[2015-08-24 10:09:19] jleyba: ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("arguments[0].style.height = '1px'; arguments[0].style.width = '1px';", el)
[2015-08-24 10:09:25] jleyba: el.sendKeys(myFilename)
[2015-08-24 10:09:40] jleyba: the executeScript step is necessary to make the element "visible" so sendKeys doesn't barf on you
[2015-08-24 10:10:38] jleyba: AutomatedTester, ^ worth changing the spec to not require visibility when sending keys to file input elements? hiding them on the page seems to be a very common pattern

[2015-08-24 12:03:06] errant_rider: you can inject JQuery to use the :containts pseudo selector

[2015-08-24 12:24:29] aimmac23: "Message: timeout: Timed out receiving message from renderer: 10.000" <--- this seems to be your particular issue
[2015-08-24 12:24:54] warfront1: yes
[2015-08-24 12:24:56] aimmac23: warfront1: either use an RDP session (and make sure it stays connected), or use a VNC session
[2015-08-24 12:25:24] harbhub: does webdriver have an "is visible" function that i can use?
[2015-08-24 12:25:26] warfront1: That would illiminate the point of scheduling it all together
[2015-08-24 12:25:30] aimmac23: if you're not bothered about which platform your tests run on, you can usually arrange something with Linux and a virtual display
[2015-08-24 12:25:34] warfront1: eliminate*
[2015-08-24 12:25:47] harbhub: i'm trying to sendKeys on an element that exists, but is not visible
[2015-08-24 12:25:58] smccarthy: harbhub: isDisplayed()
[2015-08-24 12:26:15] aimmac23: warfront1: I take it your script is launching a Chome browser?
[2015-08-24 12:26:21] warfront1: yesd
[2015-08-24 12:26:25] harbhub: thanks
[2015-08-24 12:27:23] aimmac23: I take it you're automating some sort of task, rather than trying to run some unit tests?
[2015-08-24 12:27:42] oida, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-24 12:28:12] aimmac23: if so, you could try HTMLUnit? That one isn't bothered about the lack of display, because it never renders anything
[2015-08-24 12:29:00] aimmac23: it may be a bit harder to figure out why its not working sometimes, 'cause its not rendering anything anywhere :)
[2015-08-24 12:29:32] harbhub: hmm i see the element on the screen, but it says it is not displayed
[2015-08-24 12:30:03] harbhub: elem.isDisplayed().then(function (bool) {console.log('is displayed: ', bool});
[2015-08-24 12:30:13] harbhub: this returns false for the bool value
[2015-08-24 12:30:24] harbhub: but i see it there on the screen
[2015-08-24 12:30:52] jimevans: i'm tagging out on this one. somebody else is going to have to do the explanation of what "displayed" actually means, and the myriad of things that all have to line up to make sure webdriver sees an element as "displayed"
[2015-08-24 12:33:25] aimmac23: harbub: to cover all bases, is there some sort of invisible DIV in front of your form element?
[2015-08-24 12:34:03] aimmac23: I haven't checked the code, but another interpretation of "isVisible" could be "is there anything in front of this thing that would mean that its not visible"
[2015-08-24 12:34:24] *aimmac23 saw a Microsoft website do something like that once'
[2015-08-24 12:35:52] jimevans: or, does the element in question have a height or width of 0? or do any of its parents in the DOM? or are you sure you've got the right element, because often you can get multiple elements for the same locator?
[2015-08-24 12:36:10] harbhub: all valid questions
[2015-08-24 12:36:27] harbhub: so unfortunately the page i'm trying to functionally automate tests for isn't very friendly
[2015-08-24 12:36:42] harbhub: nowcar-dev.azurewebsites.net/Account/Login
[2015-08-24 12:36:53] harbhub: it takes a while then a modal pops up for the log in
[2015-08-24 12:37:02] harbhub: strangely, there are two forms it looks like
[2015-08-24 12:37:08] harbhub: the log in and the register forms
[2015-08-24 12:37:16] eteixeira, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-24 12:37:26] harbhub: so the only difference i noticed was that the email input for log in, which i'm trying to use, has an id='email'
[2015-08-24 12:37:41] harbhub: whereas the other email input in the register form only has a name='email'
[2015-08-24 12:38:01] harbhub: so that login input#email is the one i target
[2015-08-24 12:38:27] jimevans: which returns two elements.
[2015-08-24 12:38:38] jimevans: or the css selector does
[2015-08-24 12:38:41] jimevans: not findElement.
[2015-08-24 12:39:12] harbhub: i used driver.wait(until.elementLocated(By.id('email'...
[2015-08-24 12:39:16] jimevans: the first element it finds is *not* the one on the popup.
[2015-08-24 12:39:22] harbhub: with the .then(function (elem)...
[2015-08-24 12:39:28] harbhub: alright
[2015-08-24 12:39:31] jimevans: in your browser's javascript console, do this:
[2015-08-24 12:39:44] jimevans: document.querySelectorAll("input#email")
[2015-08-24 12:40:02] jimevans: should return you a node list with two elements.
[2015-08-24 12:40:21] aimmac23: heh, saw that at work once :)
[2015-08-24 12:40:27] jimevans: that tells you the selector 'input#email' does not uniquely identify a single element on the page, it identifies two.
[2015-08-24 12:40:42] harbhub: right
[2015-08-24 12:41:03] harbhub: i see that and i understand, i was working under the assumption that i had the one and only input#email, next time i know to first check that
[2015-08-24 12:41:08] jimevans: as it happens, the first element identified by that selector is
[2015-08-24 12:41:14] jimevans: not the one you're looking for.
[2015-08-24 12:41:15] harbhub: thanks, now i will work on finding the proper one in this messy page
[2015-08-24 12:41:26] harbhub: understood, i'm glad this mistake happened
[2015-08-24 12:41:43] harbhub: now i will learn how to find the exact element that i want given multiple elements selected  (:
[2015-08-24 12:41:48] harbhub: i appreciate your help
[2015-08-24 12:42:40] harbhub: it does beg the question though, how do i separate them given this page is what i have to work with?
[2015-08-24 12:42:47] jimevans: as it happens, the following selector will do the right thing.
[2015-08-24 12:42:59] jimevans: "form#loginForm input#email"
[2015-08-24 12:43:14] harbhub: ah silly me yes

[2015-08-24 12:43:53] *jimevans reflects on how it's so. much. easier. to give advice when people are willing to share the page they're having trouble with.'
[2015-08-24 12:44:07] harbhub: as a side lesson, is there a way to take those multiple elements that got returned from the input#email and do something like you would in jquery with selecting it down by [0] or [1]
[2015-08-24 12:44:23] harbhub: hehe why wouldn't someone want to share the page lol
[2015-08-24 12:44:31] jimevans: harbhub: :kittens
[2015-08-24 12:44:47] jimevans: you'd be surprised.
[2015-08-24 12:44:56] harbhub: i try to put in my leg work and be able to clearly explain the problem i'm having AFTER i've spent time and energy trying to solve it myself
