[2015-08-18 01:29:29] HowardwLo: gah. the proxy basic auth appears when i do a driver.get, but the code doesn’t move past driver.get for me to catch the alert
[2015-08-18 01:29:45] HowardwLo: i think its wiating for the .get to complete, but it’s hung up at .get becuase of the auth
[2015-08-18 01:29:49] HowardwLo: and i can’t auth without the get? ...
[2015-08-18 01:35:02] huggie: HowardwLo: I got around basic auth following the principle in the second answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11522434/how-to-handle-login-pop-up-window-using-selenium-webdriver
[2015-08-18 01:35:27] huggie: HowardwLo: i.e. create a separate thread that you run just before the click (or in your case the get) that waits then pastes the password in.
[2015-08-18 01:36:07] huggie: HowardwLo: Though actually if yours is on the first get you might get away with getting: http://username:password@example.com instead of just http://example.com
[2015-08-18 01:36:51] HowardwLo: huggie: when i use http://username:password@example.com, it just kind of skips it...
[2015-08-18 01:37:59] huggie: HowardwLo: skips how?  You get through and get the resource you want?
[2015-08-18 01:39:08] HowardwLo: huggie: ok i noticed when i tried it, it was http://username:password@http://example.com…. that extra http:// was there by accdient.
[2015-08-18 01:39:16] HowardwLo: and it just goes to resource without any errors
[2015-08-18 01:39:23] HowardwLo: but when i open a new tab, and check the ip, it’s not the proxy
[2015-08-18 01:39:28] HowardwLo: let me try without the extra http

[2015-08-18 03:07:50] spline: im used to regular scraping where when I need to use selenium (can tell amazon does not want this automated), ill just page_source and grab what I need from there. This is the first time I've seen something w/o it. The page looks normal (html/css) but the text values when you post are not in it. I used inspector and saw that they're coming in via a post->json
[2015-08-18 03:08:02] spline: so maybe I can grab another way?
[2015-08-18 03:08:55] spline: Iceg: http://i.imgur.com/Id3RUcp.png <- view of the page. under the "Amazon Fulfillment", the text values returned are not in the actual html (as if it were blank). Must be using JS/CSS to hide or display differently?
[2015-08-18 03:10:41] Iceg: hm, sorry can't help you much on this ;o
[2015-08-18 03:12:01] spline: just doing scraping for so long, selenium helping a bit for pages like this, I can usually tell when someone doesn't want scraping done

[2015-08-18 03:26:24] spline: like a call into selenium to grab the text in the pasteboard? or does that have to do with the os/environment?
