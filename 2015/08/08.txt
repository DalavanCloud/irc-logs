[2015-08-08 07:38:22] apiarian: hello! i seem to be hitting some strange race condition with my django LiveServerTestCase. i add a user in the test function, verify that it is in the database, GET my login view, which also confirms that the user is in the database, have selenium type in the login details and click() the login button. if I add a 1 second sleep *after* the click, everything works. if I do not, the form_valid() function doing the login form
[2015-08-08 07:38:23] apiarian:  processing sees an empty database and refused to log in. moving the sleep anywhere else in the test function does nothing. there's *nothing* happening after the click(). haven't had a chance to write any asserts of checks yet. this is with a postgres database. any idea why this timing error is happening?

[2015-08-08 10:55:49] apiarian: aha! it was a race condition indeed. since there was nothing more to be done in the test case after the click, the function closed and the server shut down before the view code could actually run. so giving some extra time after the click was pressed for the server to do its thing lets the view code run on an actual full server.
