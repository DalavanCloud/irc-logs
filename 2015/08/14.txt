[2015-08-14 00:28:45] moo-_-: I assume this might be related to latest Firefox autoupdate - where I should check issues like this?

[2015-08-14 00:46:19] pauluchon: Yes

[2015-08-14 01:04:32] pauluchon: moo-_-: I've found the solution, I was lauching selenium node through ssh and that was the problem.. It's related to X11 forwarding. Thank's for your help
[2015-08-14 01:04:51] moo-_-: pauluchon: good that you got it solved!
[2015-08-14 01:05:26] pauluchon: ;)
[2015-08-14 01:11:09] mad-: i have a case were i have a mac mini that i have as a selenium server. the problem i have is after reboot the user have to be logged in in the UI to make it possible to launch chrome. have anyone done something like this that logges in a user from command line
[2015-08-14 01:12:14] mad-: it's not a option to autologin the user on boot it has to be done from command line so i can script it
[2015-08-14 01:13:30] rplevka: moo-_-: i'm trying to get the flake8 linter working, but no luck so far...i've installed the plugin anf got the package installed via pip

[2015-08-14 01:15:32] rplevka: moo-_- ah, ok :)
[2015-08-14 01:15:35] moo-_-: I had Atom one some where
[2015-08-14 01:16:02] moo-_-: darn, cannot find it
[2015-08-14 01:16:31] moo-_-: Twitter has eaten it and it is lost in its tentacle feeds
[2015-08-14 01:16:58] CTtpollard: I prefer atom tbh
[2015-08-14 01:17:15] CTtpollard: and vim for quick edits
[2015-08-14 01:18:05] rplevka: CTtpollard: i installed atom + some vim userspace...it's brilliant (even though it doesn't support the commands)
[2015-08-14 01:19:31] CTtpollard: rplevka: tbh quite a lot of the time I don't have a desktop environment, so vim is win!

[2015-08-14 01:51:40] WhereIsMySpoon: wut
[2015-08-14 01:51:44] WhereIsMySpoon: just do what i just posted
[2015-08-14 01:51:49] WhereIsMySpoon: if its empty there are no rows in table
[2015-08-14 01:51:54] WhereIsMySpoon: therefore no data
[2015-08-14 01:54:07] Quiloopee: so how do I do the if no data, then do this
[2015-08-14 01:54:08] Quiloopee: else do this
[2015-08-14 01:57:18] rplevka: Quiloopee: also, make sure to refer to the correct table...there are more than one and they don't use id...so you might want to refer to the index of the correct one tables[1]
[2015-08-14 01:57:38] Quiloopee: its fine, if any table shows up then that user has been created
[2015-08-14 01:57:47] Quiloopee: there should be nothing

[2015-08-14 02:01:18] Quiloopee: woohoo

[2015-08-14 02:05:24] WhereIsMySpoon: Quiloopee: i specifically used findElements
[2015-08-14 02:05:32] WhereIsMySpoon: because if you use that with a selector and nothing is there
[2015-08-14 02:05:34] WhereIsMySpoon: u get an empty list
[2015-08-14 02:05:37] WhereIsMySpoon: therefore nothing was found

[2015-08-14 02:08:27] WhereIsMySpoon: "make it"?
[2015-08-14 02:08:29] WhereIsMySpoon: wat
[2015-08-14 02:08:32] Quiloopee: create the user
[2015-08-14 02:08:35] Quiloopee: or whateber
[2015-08-14 02:08:38] Quiloopee: continue the script
[2015-08-14 02:08:41] WhereIsMySpoon: o.o
[2015-08-14 02:08:48] Quiloopee: problem is if the element can't be located then the script stops

[2015-08-14 02:12:00] rplevka: Quiloopee: is that supposed to be a UI test? if not, and you just want to end up with something created, i would suggest to use curl ..or requests if you want to stick to python
[2015-08-14 02:12:34] Quiloopee: just a general question on selenium:
[2015-08-14 02:12:45] Quiloopee: How do i make a script keep running if element x is not found
[2015-08-14 02:12:59] WhereIsMySpoon: Quiloopee: put it in a try catch and dont rethrow the exception
[2015-08-14 02:13:05] rplevka: :)
[2015-08-14 02:13:19] WhereIsMySpoon: Quiloopee: but that sounds like a wierd thing to do
[2015-08-14 02:13:21] CTtpollard: or just do if not
[2015-08-14 02:13:30] WhereIsMySpoon: your test script has come across something that is wrong
[2015-08-14 02:13:37] WhereIsMySpoon: an element is missing that you tried to find
[2015-08-14 02:14:04] WhereIsMySpoon: if you're trying to do an if-else for if an element exists, use findElements (note the 's') and check the list
[2015-08-14 02:14:15] WhereIsMySpoon: but you really shouldnt have to do if-else in test selenium code
[2015-08-14 02:14:23] WhereIsMySpoon: your test should be linear
[2015-08-14 02:14:28] rplevka: Quiloopee: selenium itself has nothing to do with interrupting the script
[2015-08-14 02:15:04] WhereIsMySpoon: a selenium unit test much like any other unit test should test one specific bit of functionality
[2015-08-14 02:15:12] WhereIsMySpoon: and not test multiple, which is what an if-else implies
[2015-08-14 02:16:03] WhereIsMySpoon: the more complexity you have in your tests the more likely they are to break because of some edge case and the harder they are to maintain and keep modularised
[2015-08-14 02:16:29] WhereIsMySpoon: the complexity should be in the app, and the tests should be clear small unit tests that you can be confident in
[2015-08-14 02:16:39] WhereIsMySpoon: or maybe clear large tests
[2015-08-14 02:16:45] WhereIsMySpoon: but they should be clear and specific in purpose

[2015-08-14 06:18:41] tourdedave: WhereIsMySpoon: HEAD is a header request. Similar to GET, but doesn't return a payload. It gives you the header (e.g., content type, size of the file, etc.)
[2015-08-14 06:18:53] tourdedave: So you can check the file download without actually downloading the file
[2015-08-14 06:19:29] tourdedave: And then you can drop the mic
[2015-08-14 06:19:38] tourdedave: That last step is the important one
[2015-08-14 06:20:24] warfront1: This is the the link provided

[2015-08-14 06:21:50] pauluchon: WhereIsMySpoon has left freenode ^^
[2015-08-14 06:21:55] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2015-08-14 06:22:07] WhereIsMySpoon: looks like asp
[2015-08-14 06:22:11] WhereIsMySpoon: you poor thing
[2015-08-14 06:22:41] warfront1: haha, this is why I was attempting to automate this download via seleneium
[2015-08-14 06:23:17] WhereIsMySpoon: lbtnCsv
[2015-08-14 06:23:40] WhereIsMySpoon: ive never ever used asp
[2015-08-14 06:23:43] WhereIsMySpoon: and i know 0 about it
[2015-08-14 06:23:45] pauluchon: Good thing to know, iceweasel and chromium are working properly with Selenium
[2015-08-14 06:23:56] WhereIsMySpoon: but this: &#39;ctl00$ctl00$ContentBody$BodyLevelElment$lbtnCsv&#39 looks like some sort of bind
[2015-08-14 06:24:04] WhereIsMySpoon: ctl100 is the id of the master page
[2015-08-14 06:24:07] dimacus, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-08-14 06:24:17] WhereIsMySpoon: so ctl100 -> content body -> "body level element" -> IbtnCsv
[2015-08-14 06:24:30] WhereIsMySpoon: find out what IBtnCsv is and mayeb you'll get it

[2015-08-14 06:25:53] WhereIsMySpoon: oh yea
[2015-08-14 06:25:58] WhereIsMySpoon: so find out what doPostBack is
[2015-08-14 06:26:04] warfront1: some asp shit
[2015-08-14 06:26:27] WhereIsMySpoon: you need to find out what is being done in that method

[2015-08-14 06:53:38] pauluchon: Another good one, is with chromium on the Linux node, tests execute without problems, but tearDown() method isn't executed so I've a lot of mess in my app...

[2015-08-14 07:05:58] warfront1: The ability to download doesn't even load, because the web page doesn't even return the element when there is no javascript availabler

I’ve tried a few different ways, but using a browser.get(var), where var is the getAttribute(‘href’) gives me the error use string not an object. I’ve tried toString() and that doesn’t seem to help either. but I am in fact getting the url string, if i expect(var).tobe(true);  I can see the url

[2015-08-14 11:42:31] dude-x: leandroal: they are selenium compatible
[2015-08-14 11:42:38] leandroal: or even... use phantomjs with support of java plugin to load pages that executes java applets?
[2015-08-14 11:42:46] jimevans: leandroal: most language bindings have a phantomjs driver included.

[2015-08-14 11:43:27] jimevans: leandroal: for that type of feature in phantomjs, you'd need to modify phantomjs itself, i think.
[2015-08-14 11:43:31] leandroal: dude-x, jimevans the point is that I can't use only phantomjs because its last versions does not support java plugin
[2015-08-14 11:44:09] leandroal: jimevans,  any suggestion about how can I start the work for enable java plugin in phantomjs?
[2015-08-14 11:44:18] jimevans: if the browser (phantomjs) doesn't support it, what would lead you to believe that selenium webdriver (which only drives the existing browser) would enable that?
[2015-08-14 11:44:57] jimevans: leandroal: that'd be a question for the phantomjs project itself. kinda depends on how comfortable you are with C++ and QtWebKit.
[2015-08-14 11:45:28] leandroal: jimevans,  this is why I asked phantomjs PLUS slimerjs, which supports java plugin by loading the firefox engine
[2015-08-14 11:45:43] jimevans: i've never used slimerjs.

[2015-08-14 11:46:45] leandroal: jimevans,  exact, but this is the price to have support for java plugin, at least for start

[2015-08-14 14:17:05] elyograg: I have a test (suite?) that I came up with which works in the Selenium IDE on my Windows machine inside Firefox.

[2015-08-14 14:21:51] titusfortner: IDE is deprecated
[2015-08-14 14:22:04] shawnknight, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-14 14:22:37] titusfortner: It will likely be easier to rewrite in webdriver than to troubleshoot from IDE
[2015-08-14 14:22:58] elyograg: I only used the IDE to create the test suite.  I'm not having a problem with the IDE.
[2015-08-14 14:25:17] titusfortner: Selenium RC is not really supported any longer, either :)
[2015-08-14 14:25:41] elyograg: ok ... so if I want to make tests and run them on the linux commandline, what should I be doing?
[2015-08-14 14:25:54] titusfortner: Which language?
[2015-08-14 14:26:42] jimevans: No More RC!
[2015-08-14 14:26:52] elyograg: ideally?  none, or bash.  I provide a bunch of html files with tests, I have a script that runs each one and detects whether or not it passed, then sends the status back to xymon.
[2015-08-14 14:28:10] elyograg: I'd rather not write a whole program for each website I want to test ... I'd like this to be configuration-driven.
[2015-08-14 14:28:23] jimevans: elyograg: you're attempting to use so-called 'selenese', with html files representing the scripts, if i'm reading you right.
[2015-08-14 14:29:28] elyograg: jimevans: sounds about right.  I'm comfortable in Java and Perl, and a Perl script could count as a config file. ;)
[2015-08-14 14:29:43] jimevans: given that selense is over 10 years old, and has been deprecated for something like the last 4 years, and no one who actually commits to the project uses it, and no one is actually maintaining it, i'd suspect you're not going to be able to get much help.
[2015-08-14 14:30:05] jimevans: i, for example, won't help.
[2015-08-14 14:30:54] elyograg: ok.  understood.  i'm about two days into toying with selenium, so these are things that I could tell from the website.

[2015-08-14 14:31:37] elyograg: thinking about a config file, I suppose that with scripting to automatically compile it, a .java file could also serve as a config file.
[2015-08-14 14:32:15] elyograg: if the approach I'm taking now is completely wrong, and I am ready to accept that it is, please tell me how you'd tackle my general use case.
[2015-08-14 14:32:35] smccarthy: is IDE really depracated ? I thought there was just a release a little bit ago
[2015-08-14 14:33:04] jimevans: the way i'd do it is to write code to the webdriver api.
[2015-08-14 14:33:14] titusfortner: Anyone who is using the IDE is doing it wrong. :)
[2015-08-14 14:33:34] jimevans: smccarthy: samit is occasionally releasing things, but no *real* enhancement is being done on it.
[2015-08-14 14:33:44] smccarthy: cool ok !
[2015-08-14 14:34:00] elyograg: ok, i do see a selenium module for perl.
[2015-08-14 14:34:10] jimevans: no one currently committing to the project believes in the record-playback paradigm enough to invest the time and effort into crafting/maintaining a better solution.
[2015-08-14 14:34:21] jimevans: Selenium Builder was supposed to be the way forward with that.
[2015-08-14 14:35:14] jimevans: but i have no idea where we are with the donation of that source code to the software freedom conservancy (the 501(3)c org that owns the selenium copyrights)
[2015-08-14 14:35:19] titusfortner: Does perl have a webdriver solution?
[2015-08-14 14:35:38] elyograg: Java programs feel a lot cleaner to me than perl scripts, but I'd need to come up with infrastructure to recompile then when they are udated.  that's just a hurdle, not a showstopper.
[2015-08-14 14:35:41] jimevans: there may be an unofficial language binding.
[2015-08-14 14:35:51] jimevans: but no, the project doesn't provide a perl webdriver binding.
[2015-08-14 14:36:28] jimevans: elyograg: python might be a better choice, just because you could avoid the hassle of invoking a java compiler.
[2015-08-14 14:36:33] elyograg: I tried three different versions of Firefox trying to make the selenium server work, so I suspect it's not a "firefox too new" problem. :)
[2015-08-14 14:36:46] elyograg: jimevans: true ... and I always hear good things about python, but I don't know it yet.
[2015-08-14 14:37:03] *jimevans doesn't use python on a daily basis either'
[2015-08-14 14:37:45] elyograg: One day I will take the plunge and learn it, but this is not the project for that. :)
[2015-08-14 14:37:48] titusfortner: and I'll put in a plug for using Ruby. It's more perl-like than python
[2015-08-14 14:40:35] jimevans: freakin' dynamic languages with their duck typing and interpreted code...
[2015-08-14 14:40:47] jimevans: get off my lawn, you whippersnappers!
[2015-08-14 14:40:58] dude-x: +1 python
[2015-08-14 14:40:59] elyograg: with all this information, I think perhaps a Java system might serve me best since the perl client is not official, and reading it's docs, it looks like it connects to RC, which you guys said is not the way to go.
[2015-08-14 14:41:38] jimevans: elyograg: you'll want to look at the webdriver api specifically.
[2015-08-14 14:42:15] jimevans: :google perl webdriver
[2015-08-14 14:42:53] *jimevans makes no warranties, expressed or implied, about the quality or ease of use of that module'
[2015-08-14 14:43:05] sgsabbage: how about PHP? *hides*
[2015-08-14 14:43:29] jimevans: sgsabbage: sure. take your pick of the 17 different implementation of a webdriver client api in php.
[2015-08-14 14:43:47] elyograg: I'd be worried about that package, because I can't get the selenium server to run my test, which makes me think that having a perl program tickle the server won't work any better.
[2015-08-14 14:44:02] sgsabbage: facebook4lyf
[2015-08-14 14:44:10] elyograg: I could be wrong. :)
[2015-08-14 14:44:14] jimevans: elyograg: you are.
[2015-08-14 14:44:30] jimevans: wrong, that is. at least in this case.
[2015-08-14 14:45:17] jimevans: webdriver uses entirely different code paths and mechanisms than the "html suite runner" and selenium rc.
[2015-08-14 14:45:45] jimevans: even though the single selenium-standalone-server.jar file contains the code for both approaches (webdriver and rc)
[2015-08-14 14:45:59] jimevans: you cannot conflate the two.
[2015-08-14 14:47:00] elyograg: ok, just downloaded the java client zipfile.
[2015-08-14 14:47:19] jimevans: but i'm off

[2015-08-14 14:55:50] elyograg: so one idea here is to write a little program for each website I want to test.  Have the .java file in essence become the "config" file for that website.  The infrastructure that I'd have to build around that would check the date of the compiled version against the source file and recompile it if it's out of date.  On the executing end, I'd run each one (undecided whether it is a .jar file or a com/example/stuff structure with classes).
[2015-08-14 14:56:56] elyograg: i suppose i could write it into one program that incorporates a bunch of smaller .java files, each one handling a specific website.
[2015-08-14 14:58:24] elyograg: it would be nice to have it be "config" driven, even if the configs are actually java source files.
[2015-08-14 14:58:58] elyograg: currently my test system uses webinject and has www.example.com.xml files.
[2015-08-14 14:59:48] elyograg: A first step would be to write one of these little programs and verify that I can make it work.
