[2015-08-04 04:38:12] tiagoboldt: hey guys, my protractor tests often fail on fast CPUs when I have a select2 inside a model. Anyone with insight on this? detailed here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31808088/angular-protractor-tests-fail-with-select2-inside-modal
[2015-08-04 04:38:56] WhereIsMySpoon: tiagoboldt: are you using an explicit wait?
[2015-08-04 04:39:47] tiagoboldt: WhereIsMySpoon I'm not and I wouldn't like to.
[2015-08-04 04:39:55] WhereIsMySpoon: it sounds like when you're talking about on "fast cpus" that you're having timing issues
[2015-08-04 04:40:08] WhereIsMySpoon: tiagoboldt: you need to use waits to ensure reliable tests
[2015-08-04 04:40:14] WhereIsMySpoon: on the selenium side
[2015-08-04 04:42:11] tiagoboldt: while selenium in used, I believe protractor should ensure the interaction with angularjs and only execute the next instruction once the DOM is ready.
[2015-08-04 04:42:24] WhereIsMySpoon: tiagoboldt: what does "DOM is ready" mean
[2015-08-04 04:43:08] dimacus1, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-04 04:43:19] tiagoboldt: nice one! well, I'm not fully sure, but from their docs: "Automatic Waiting
[2015-08-04 04:43:19] tiagoboldt: You no longer need to add waits and sleeps to your test. Protractor can automatically execute the next step in your test the moment the webpage finishes pending tasks, so you don’t have to worry about waiting for your test and webpage to sync."
[2015-08-04 04:43:23] WhereIsMySpoon: im gonna bet pretty much everything on the fact that you're having timing issues and need to add a wait
[2015-08-04 04:44:04] WhereIsMySpoon: pending tasks may not include animation
[2015-08-04 04:44:08] tiagoboldt: WhereIsMySpoon if I add sleeps to the tests it works, I was just trying to find a better solution, regarding test performance.
[2015-08-04 04:44:16] WhereIsMySpoon: it may just try to detect ajax calls or redirects/injections etc
[2015-08-04 04:44:29] WhereIsMySpoon: tiagoboldt: -everyone- uses the waits provided by the selenium api in their tests
[2015-08-04 04:44:36] WhereIsMySpoon: tiagoboldt: this isnt a Thread.sleep you'll be adding
[2015-08-04 04:45:41] WhereIsMySpoon: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22072327/how-can-i-wait-for-a-condition
[2015-08-04 04:46:15] tiagoboldt: ok, so, in your opinion, I should wait at least the time of the animation whenever I have one..
[2015-08-04 04:46:37] WhereIsMySpoon: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21748442/protractor-how-to-wait-for-page-complete-after-click-a-button
[2015-08-04 04:47:08] WhereIsMySpoon: tiagoboldt: I would suggest you to try that, yes
[2015-08-04 04:47:23] WhereIsMySpoon: it will only wait as long as it needs to for the promise you make to become true
[2015-08-04 04:47:29] WhereIsMySpoon: then it will continue
[2015-08-04 04:47:38] WhereIsMySpoon: look up expected conditions
[2015-08-04 04:48:56] WhereIsMySpoon: tiagoboldt: in the background, all protractor will do is just be using waits anyway :)

[2015-08-04 07:25:24] tiagoboldt: makes sense. will explore that. thanks :)
[2015-08-04 07:25:39] WhereIsMySpoon: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-play-state.asp
[2015-08-04 07:25:40] kris_: barancev: thats something I havent tried, will try out, thanks. full command could look like java -classpath selenium-standalone-2.47.1.jar;operaprestodriver.jar org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncher -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.47.1.jar -role node -hub http://10.0.1.208:4444/grid/register -nodeConfig NodeConfig2.json ?
[2015-08-04 07:25:41] WhereIsMySpoon: this maybe
[2015-08-04 07:25:54] WhereIsMySpoon: kris_: you cant use -jar with -classpaht
[2015-08-04 07:25:57] WhereIsMySpoon: he just said that
[2015-08-04 07:26:21] kris_: oh, didnt see that, my bad, sorry
[2015-08-04 07:26:41] WhereIsMySpoon: remove the -jar bit
[2015-08-04 07:26:48] kris_: so I need to run -classpath first, and then -jar ?
[2015-08-04 07:26:52] WhereIsMySpoon: ...
[2015-08-04 07:26:53] WhereIsMySpoon: no
[2015-08-04 07:27:18] kris_: just -classpath ?
[2015-08-04 07:27:23] WhereIsMySpoon: java -classpath selenium-standalone-2.47.1.jar org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncher will launch java, which will look at the selenium jar on its classpath and launch the GridLauncher class
[2015-08-04 07:27:31] WhereIsMySpoon: then you add in the opera jar as well
[2015-08-04 07:27:33] WhereIsMySpoon: as baran did
[2015-08-04 07:27:47] WhereIsMySpoon: just copy what he pasted and add on your-role -hub and -nodeConfig
[2015-08-04 07:27:52] kris_: oh, got it, cool, thanks, will try out!

[2015-08-04 17:04:22] *jimevans screams in rage and frustration at webdriver protocol differences'
[2015-08-04 17:05:45] jimevans: trying to talk two versions of the webdriver protocol (open-source vs. w3c) is really a pain in the ass.
[2015-08-04 17:06:23] jimevans: i should point out that the pain is felt largely in statically typed languages.
[2015-08-04 17:07:09] jimevans: it's awfully convenient to have a class that represents a response, with type-safe properties and/or methods for the parts of the response.
[2015-08-04 17:07:43] jimevans: if the responses in the protocol have different structures (which they do, and will, and be it ever thus), you can't have a single class that represents both types of responses.

[2015-08-04 17:10:00] jimevans: just when i thought i'd figured out the local end for talking both versions of the protocol in c#, i looked at the IE driver code to do the same, and fell into a spiral of self doubt and despair

[2015-08-04 17:12:04] jimevans: except they've no interest in the IE driver, the open-source one or theirs, except the open-source one works well enough for them to forego working on their implementation for IE.

[2015-08-04 17:43:05] sevaseva: jimevans: Jim, but .. what did you want to change in iedriver code wrt this, can you clarify? it speaks the opensource dialect, it should probably just continue doing that, no?
[2015-08-04 17:44:12] sevaseva: jimevans: ahh,, never mind. I'm stupid. incoming commands in the w3c format, of course
[2015-08-04 17:44:12] jimevans: sevaseva: at some point, the language bindings are going to speak w3c, and no longer speak the open-source dialect. i'm trying to get a leg up on that day.
[2015-08-04 17:44:31] jimevans: yes, exactly so.
[2015-08-04 17:44:46] jimevans: but not that you're stupid, sevaseva. you're far from that. :)
[2015-08-04 17:46:22] sevaseva: on that note though... it looks like the tendency is to write local ends that speak both dialects (even the w3c python client)
[2015-08-04 17:46:34] jimevans: sevaseva: for now, it is, yes.
[2015-08-04 17:46:48] jimevans: eventually, that shouldn't be the case though.
[2015-08-04 17:46:52] sevaseva: so maybe remote ends can get away without speaking both?
[2015-08-04 17:47:42] *sevaseva tries to estimate how long ie11 has left'
[2015-08-04 17:48:14] jimevans: they might be able to, but i'm getting rid of the OSS dialect in the .NET bindings as soon as practically possible. i wouldn't implement speaking both dialects in the language bindings unless i absolutely had to, which i do, but i do so under extreme protest and with much kicking and screaming.
[2015-08-04 17:48:17] *sevaseva ... and the chances of MS to get back and complete an implementation for ie11...'
[2015-08-04 17:48:54] jimevans: sevaseva: i would estimate the chances of MSFT backporting the pieces necessary to make a complete-ish implementation for IE to be less than 10%
[2015-08-04 17:50:23] sevaseva: year, that's fair..
[2015-08-04 17:51:34] sevaseva: "as soon as practically possible" for oss dialect in .net bindings will .. probably be a long               while    , right? (as sad as it is for the complexity of the code)
[2015-08-04 17:52:42] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-04 17:53:27] sevaseva: this reminds me .. as I am trying to teach selenium java server to pipe through non-standard commands, I look though a lot of the code that will need to change for dual dialect support in Java local end. Did someone already start workign on that already?
[2015-08-04 17:54:01] jimevans: sevaseva: if it doesn't happen soon enough for my liking (which will probably be contingent on chromium shipping a spec-compliant remote end), i'll fork the damned thing, and leave the "official" .NET bindings to rot.
[2015-08-04 17:54:49] jimevans: i have no desire to maintain the dual code path messiness that will occur with speaking multiple dialects.
[2015-08-04 17:55:49] jimevans: but, that's all for me today.
