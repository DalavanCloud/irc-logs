[2015-08-28 01:29:39] tools_: Hey ladies and gentlemen, I need a bit of help with selenium and testing of a website. I need to click, an td element, which first appears on the website after approx 5 seconds. But how do I tell selenium to wait? I have tried implicitly wait, and wait to no avail, can some one help ?
[2015-08-28 01:34:21] huggie: You can always write your own loop (is it there yet? no, sleep etc)
[2015-08-28 01:36:28] rplevka, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-28 01:36:31] tools_: like while((element = driver.findElment(By.id(something)) != null) ?
[2015-08-28 01:37:19] tools_: I this will throw and ElementNotFoundException or something similar

[2015-08-28 01:48:20] sgsabbage: tools_: are you using the Java bindings? I guess you are by the code snippet?
[2015-08-28 01:48:43] tools_: No I am using python, but I thought most used the java ones, so there for java code :)
[2015-08-28 01:49:24] sgsabbage: ahh
[2015-08-28 01:49:42] tools_: But I have tried in java as well with same problem :)
[2015-08-28 01:49:43] sgsabbage: you probably want to use the explicit waits in https://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/waits.html
[2015-08-28 01:49:53] sgsabbage: they ignore the NotFoundExceptions
[2015-08-28 01:50:18] tools_: But do they not halt the driver instance as well ?
[2015-08-28 01:50:26] sgsabbage: what do you mean by halt?
[2015-08-28 01:53:18] tools_: just stop the driver for n seconds, because it seems to me, like that is what happens. Like it is just on pause for n seconds and then resume what it was doing
[2015-08-28 01:54:24] sgsabbage: no, that's not how the driver works
[2015-08-28 01:54:34] sgsabbage: it just polls it every x ms to check if the condition has been met
[2015-08-28 01:54:47] sgsabbage: the browser will continue doing what it does
[2015-08-28 01:54:54] tools_: okay will try thank you
[2015-08-28 01:54:59] sgsabbage: your tests obviously won't continue until the wait is finished, but that's the point :)

[2015-08-28 05:45:46] tools_: IWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(@"path to chrome driver"); should be correct
[2015-08-28 05:46:04] tools_: please only use var in C# if you know what you are doing :D
[2015-08-28 05:46:24] andreas_: thanks for the help :)
[2015-08-28 05:46:45] andreas_: no the <path to driver> is only pseudo code
[2015-08-28 05:47:14] andreas_: I didn't want to expose the exact path here
[2015-08-28 05:47:16] tools_: it is the ChromeDriver, I think is worng

[2015-08-28 05:48:14] andreas_: do you mean the version of the chromedriver is wrong?
[2015-08-28 05:48:21] tools_: uuh thanks selbot2 did not know that
[2015-08-28 05:49:01] tools_: No, it is the deceleration of the new ChromeDriver, that seems wrong to me.

[2015-08-28 05:49:38] tools_: hmm
[2015-08-28 05:49:44] andreas_: aha ok
[2015-08-28 05:50:02] andreas_: that row is not really correct either..
[2015-08-28 05:50:09] andreas_: actually it looks like this:
[2015-08-28 05:50:20] andreas_: var driver = new SessionExposingChromeDriver(driverService, chromeBrowserOptions, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(120));
[2015-08-28 05:50:49] tools_: That seems more right
[2015-08-28 05:50:53] andreas_: SessionExposingChromeDriver is a class derived from ChromeDriver
[2015-08-28 05:51:00] andreas_: ok good :)
[2015-08-28 05:52:10] andreas_: when executing that last row it throws an exception saying: "unknown error: unrecognized Chrome version: ......"
[2015-08-28 05:52:48] andreas_: is there anything one need to do to run the chromedriver on a non chrome browser?
[2015-08-28 05:53:31] sircapsalot, leaving. (#selenium)
[2015-08-28 05:53:33] andreas_: I read somewhere something about some experimental parameter to chromedriver, but I could not find any more info on it
[2015-08-28 05:53:59] tools_: question did you set the capabilities to be Chrome ?
[2015-08-28 05:54:32] tools_: Like the Getting started example: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver
[2015-08-28 05:59:07] andreas_: no I did not
[2015-08-28 05:59:30] andreas_: I'll try that. Thank you for the help! :)

[2015-08-28 06:07:26] kleini_: i've tried fiddling with those timeout setting, I guess I should look into that some more
[2015-08-28 06:07:44] sgsabbage: so, more information that would be useful in getting help - what are you doing at the point you get it, do you always get it, what's your setup, etc

[2015-08-28 06:12:09] sgsabbage: for example, if you're using grid, an interesting default is that if the hub is waiting for a session to be 'free', it will wait indefinitely (and not respond to the HTTP request until a requested session is available). cURL will timeout if it gets no response (while the hub may still be waiting). The command line option to change this default is -newSessionWaitTimeout

[2015-08-28 06:13:00] tools_: cURL is a b.... to get working with selenium in my experience
[2015-08-28 06:14:04] sgsabbage: mind, if you change newSessionWaitTimeout you'll get an exception rather than cURL timing out, but that might be preferable
[2015-08-28 06:14:08] kleini_: until now I was also wondering why this code used to work and now not anymore. But I guess your explanation could mean that the 'state' has changed in such a way that now the hub can't find any free sessions where previously it was able to do so
[2015-08-28 06:14:22] sgsabbage: potentially, yes. I'm guessing it's happening when requesting a new session?
[2015-08-28 06:14:32] sgsabbage: also worthwhile checking the hub logs
[2015-08-28 06:14:39] kleini_: depends, it fails on a button click
[2015-08-28 06:14:48] sgsabbage: ah, that might be something different then
[2015-08-28 06:14:57] sgsabbage: I've never had a problem with cURL and Selenium. Well. Nothing huuge.
[2015-08-28 06:15:32] kleini_: Ill poke the server guy to see what settings he's using for the hub

[2015-08-28 06:28:01] kleini_: okay, I still don't exactly know what the issue was, but restarting the selenium related processes fixed the issue
[2015-08-28 06:28:18] harbhub: ah the old fashioned solution
[2015-08-28 06:28:23] harbhub: turn it off then turn it on again
[2015-08-28 06:28:24] harbhub: lol
[2015-08-28 06:28:27] kleini_: thanks sgsabbage for putting me in that direction

[2015-08-28 06:28:49] harbhub: :p
[2015-08-28 06:29:02] kleini_: it might have been memory (leak?) related
[2015-08-28 06:29:21] harbhub: was it a long running process?
[2015-08-28 06:29:21] kleini_: looking at those proceses before we killed them
[2015-08-28 06:29:27] kleini_: couple of weeks
[2015-08-28 06:29:43] harbhub: did you compare the starting memory usage to the final?
[2015-08-28 06:30:05] kleini_: not in detail, but yes :)
[2015-08-28 06:30:13] harbhub: was there a drastic difference?
[2015-08-28 06:30:47] kleini_: there was an enourmous peak right before we killed it, but it had been running relatively stable before that for a couple of weeks
[2015-08-28 06:31:04] kleini_: so, really don't know what caused it
[2015-08-28 06:31:34] kleini_: and, now I'm gonna put my verion control back to where it should be and test if things still work...
[2015-08-28 06:32:19] harbhub: hmm

[2015-08-28 06:41:00] snumb130: I apologize in advance for what probably seems like a simple question. I have been having trouble understanding how to run my tests with the container. I have an app that requires me to run test in browser. I and running npm install in a node container. The data is there and shared, but I can't figure out how I am supposed to use the selenium container to run my tests.
[2015-08-28 06:41:47] sircapsalot: var driver = require('selenium-webdriver');
[2015-08-28 06:41:54] sircapsalot: there are tons of examples out there, snumb130
[2015-08-28 06:43:57] snumb130: I am not looking in the right places I guess.  Spent the last two days looking for this.  Running in the same container is not a problem but I am trying to build in one docker container and test in the other.  I guess my biggest confusion is do I run my tests in my 'node' docker container and link to 'selenium' container somehow.  Or am I supposed to run inside the selenium container.  I cannot figure out the linkage.  M

[2015-08-28 07:33:01] AutomatedTester: jimevans: did you see I made a change to execute script
[2015-08-28 07:33:09] jimevans: execute/async?
[2015-08-28 07:33:14] jimevans: or something else?
[2015-08-28 07:33:28] AutomatedTester: so /execute is now /execute/sync
[2015-08-28 07:33:40] jimevans: ooooh, no i didn't see that.
[2015-08-28 07:33:56] AutomatedTester: since, and it was a good point from jgraham, that async is not a sub action of execute
[2015-08-28 07:34:08] jimevans: that is a good point
[2015-08-28 07:34:24] AutomatedTester: so they now have a "mirror"
[2015-08-28 07:34:30] jimevans: indeed.
[2015-08-28 07:34:40] AutomatedTester: and that is in wires

[2015-08-28 07:41:18] jimevans: dude-x: think chromedriver, but for firefox.
[2015-08-28 07:41:19] jimevans: :)
[2015-08-28 07:41:28] jimevans: or IEDriverServer
[2015-08-28 07:41:38] dude-x: yeah i get that...

[2015-08-28 07:41:57] harbhub: im scared to use internet explorer with anything lol
[2015-08-28 07:42:05] AutomatedTester: harbhub: why?
[2015-08-28 07:42:06] harbhub: i've been sticking to chromedriver
[2015-08-28 07:42:16] AutomatedTester: IE 11 is a really great browser
[2015-08-28 07:42:34] harbhub: AutomatedTester: because internet explorer has a long history of being dreadful and not conforming to standards that the other browsers support
[2015-08-28 07:42:35] AutomatedTester: and so is Edge
[2015-08-28 07:42:53] jimevans: harbhub: i don't blame you. the developer of the IE driver can't code his way out of a paper bag if he used both hands and a flashlight.
[2015-08-28 07:42:54] AutomatedTester: harbhub: actually you will find that IE has stuck to standards and the other browsers havent
[2015-08-28 07:42:56] harbhub: AutomatedTester: that are the latest technologies, maybe they are good, i haven't tried them yet
[2015-08-28 07:43:28] jimevans: the browser itself is pretty good.
[2015-08-28 07:43:31] harbhub: AutomatedTester: then the problem is that they have stuck to outdated/limiting standards
[2015-08-28 07:44:05] jimevans: harbhub: i'm afraid your prejudice is showing.
[2015-08-28 07:44:25] harbhub: yes, i can see my bias/prejudice showing too
[2015-08-28 07:44:43] harbhub: let's help me shore that up since i don't like being prejudiced
[2015-08-28 07:44:53] harbhub: and often times i'm ignorant and need others to help me see the light
[2015-08-28 07:44:57] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: I still find that IE is slower in general than other browsers, both network wise and rendering wise
[2015-08-28 07:45:29] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: that may be so. i don't believe it to be orders of magnitude slower anymore though, like legacy versions of IE.
[2015-08-28 07:45:35] harbhub: internet explorer has left a sour taste in my mouth, i don't like the user interface (again, i don't know anything about 11 and edge, so i'm speaking about the previous versions)
[2015-08-28 07:45:42] jimevans: (where "legacy" == "pre-chakra"
[2015-08-28 07:45:48] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-28 07:45:49] harbhub: and cross-browser compatibility has been a bit annoying
[2015-08-28 07:45:58] harbhub: ^ not just due to IE though
[2015-08-28 07:46:05] AutomatedTester: harbhub: the problem is not the limiting standards but engines like Webkit cutting corners
[2015-08-28 07:46:12] AutomatedTester: harbhub: what are your thoughts on Safari?
[2015-08-28 07:46:16] harbhub: more so because there are a few major browsers and things that should be supported and work the same simply don't
[2015-08-28 07:46:17] sgsabbage: at $dayjob we've found that we've had to do very very little browser-specific work for IE 11 (having a very ajax heavy application), no more than we've had to do for Chrome/Safari/Firefox
[2015-08-28 07:46:45] sgsabbage: let us not speak of the number of differences we found in IE 9, however
[2015-08-28 07:46:51] harbhub: so far, i stick to chrome, i like the user interface, it is more minimalistic to me
[2015-08-28 07:46:55] WhereIsMySpoon: I think if I didnt have to debug issues caused by IE8 every other week or so I'd be more inclined towards it
[2015-08-28 07:47:03] WhereIsMySpoon: i also agree with harbhub on the UI
[2015-08-28 07:47:06] jimevans: sgsabbage: s/the number of differences we found in//
[2015-08-28 07:47:11] jimevans: there. i fixed it for you.
[2015-08-28 07:47:13] AutomatedTester: sgsabbage: complaining about IE9 is like complaining about Firefox 30
[2015-08-28 07:47:15] sgsabbage: jimevans: thank you
[2015-08-28 07:47:27] jimevans: :)
[2015-08-28 07:48:00] AutomatedTester: it's an outdated browsre
[2015-08-28 07:48:00] sgsabbage: AutomatedTester: Not necessarily, I suspect (not backed up) that the browser share of IE9 is greater than the browser share of FF 30
[2015-08-28 07:48:04] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: I think it's less that it's a terrible browser now, its more the fact that chrome is still pretty awesome, and I see no reason to change, and still have reasons not to change, though they are more minor
[2015-08-28 07:48:27] dude-x: I like Chrome but it has problems, it eats up CPU cycles and RAM
[2015-08-28 07:48:30] jimevans: here is everyone's periodic reminder that as of 12 january 2016, microsoft will only be supporting IE 11 and above for windows 7 or later.
[2015-08-28 07:48:30] harbhub: AutomatedTester: the thing you are missing is that some projects are required to support those outdated IE browsers, which isn't IEs fault but it makes me hate them more
[2015-08-28 07:48:43] dude-x: and the chromedriver can break your tests
[2015-08-28 07:48:52] AutomatedTester: harbhub: you nailed it there
[2015-08-28 07:48:58] WhereIsMySpoon: harbhub: like me
[2015-08-28 07:49:03] harbhub: since i end up having to write shims and hacks to make the older IE work
[2015-08-28 07:49:23] AutomatedTester: harbhub: complaining about old, nearly unsupported browsers, is not the browser vendors fault necessarily
[2015-08-28 07:49:28] harbhub: so the first thing that i wasnt realizing before is that this is NOT microsoft's fault
[2015-08-28 07:49:34] harbhub: they can't FORCE users to move on and update
[2015-08-28 07:49:41] AutomatedTester: no
[2015-08-28 07:49:45] jimevans: try though they might.
[2015-08-28 07:49:46] jimevans: :)
[2015-08-28 07:49:48] sgsabbage: jimevans: And that is something that makes me very happy. Even though our advice to customers is 'use the most recent version or the previous version' (so we'll support 10 and 11 at the moment)
[2015-08-28 07:49:52] harbhub: right, i was erroneously attributing it to them
[2015-08-28 07:50:10] sgsabbage: and of course Edge
[2015-08-28 07:50:29] sgsabbage: (yay edge)
[2015-08-28 07:50:35] harbhub: but the problem still exists, and i still hate the older versions of IE when i'm forced to write compatible web apps
[2015-08-28 07:50:42] jimevans: edge is an amazing leap forward for microsoft.
[2015-08-28 07:50:46] sircapsalot: yes it is
[2015-08-28 07:50:52] sircapsalot: so is the entire .net platform going open source
[2015-08-28 07:51:00] harbhub: fortunately, i'm considering starting my own LLC software company so i won't have to do that (unless there becomes a big enough demand, which would be a good problem to have)
[2015-08-28 07:51:06] sgsabbage: so far we've only found one issue with it, which we fixed. Therefore Edge is the browser that has required the least specific-code for so far :D
[2015-08-28 07:51:20] jimevans: not necessarily in technology, but in the concept of abandoning backward compatibility with previous versions of the proprietary browser apis
[2015-08-28 07:51:33] sgsabbage: also, jimevans, I am curious. How DOES one code their way out of a paper bag?
[2015-08-28 07:51:45] harbhub: lol
[2015-08-28 07:51:56] jimevans: i wouldn't know, clearly, because the developer of the IE driver can't do it. :)
[2015-08-28 07:52:11] harbhub: jimevans, i would like to use progressive enhancement
[2015-08-28 07:52:16] harbhub: but i haven't learned that yet
[2015-08-28 07:52:20] sgsabbage: surely the answer is not to use code to try and solve a physical problem ;)
[2015-08-28 07:52:33] jimevans: again, i plead ignorance
[2015-08-28 07:52:41] harbhub: anyways, thanks AutomatedTester jimevans WhereIsMySpoon
[2015-08-28 07:52:42] jimevans: code all the things!!
[2015-08-28 07:52:47] sgsabbage: ...also that must be a big paper bag
[2015-08-28 07:53:02] sgsabbage: I have never found one big enough to hold a developer and a development machine
[2015-08-28 07:53:03] harbhub: for pointing out my prejudice, helping me see why i was thinking that way to begin with, and now i'm a better person
[2015-08-28 07:53:34] AutomatedTester: harbhub: the IE team are actaully really nice approachable and smart people
[2015-08-28 07:53:38] jimevans: harbhub: it's common fordevelopers to have blind spots when it comes to microsoft technologies.
[2015-08-28 07:53:40] sgsabbage: I've just figured it out. Your code has to use up all of the CPU(s) so the machine gets hot enough to burn its way out

[2015-08-28 07:54:41] AutomatedTester: harbhub: the problem is not Microsoft in that sense
[2015-08-28 07:54:46] harbhub: it seems like microsoft has more hoops to jump through in order to use anything that they themselves didnt make, but again i am aware that i have for a long time now been biased
[2015-08-28 07:54:54] harbhub: so i'd like to clear these things up
[2015-08-28 07:55:15] AutomatedTester: harbhub: nodejs was developed firstly for posix systems with an after thought given to WIndows
[2015-08-28 07:55:17] jimevans: as we discussed yesterday, i'm firmly in generation x and not a millennial, so i don't use all those new-fangled things like nodejs.

[2015-08-28 09:17:45] *lukeis doubt edge does yet'
[2015-08-28 09:17:55] jimevans: no, i'm quite sure edge doesn't
[2015-08-28 09:18:08] lukeis: it's relatively new to the spec
[2015-08-28 09:18:10] jimevans: the spec change was after their release of driver

[2015-08-28 09:19:33] barancev: jimevans: does edge support id and tagname location strategies? or the standard ones only?
[2015-08-28 09:19:55] titusfortner: it doesn't support xpath :)
[2015-08-28 09:20:28] jimevans: i don't recall.
[2015-08-28 09:20:33] titusfortner: I'm pretty sure my tests passed for everything else with edge
[2015-08-28 09:20:33] jimevans: i've not tested it extensively
[2015-08-28 09:20:50] jimevans: because of the lack of element.findElement support
[2015-08-28 09:20:56] *barancev is learning to hate the diversity'
[2015-08-28 09:21:02] jimevans: well, that and frames
[2015-08-28 09:21:27] jimevans: i wish MSFT would push an update.

[2015-08-28 09:21:57] jimevans: dude-x: it was better to get *something* out than wait.
[2015-08-28 09:21:59] titusfortner: hopefully they are focused on fixing those next :)

[2015-08-28 09:24:02] barancev: jimevans: the status document does not mention id and tagname strategies...
[2015-08-28 09:24:09] dude-x: jimevans: i understand the need to get something out, but i think leaving out xpath is a biggie since it is a useful way to get elements easily.
[2015-08-28 09:25:06] barancev: css mafia paid more

[2015-08-28 09:27:57] titusfortner: this passed on edge: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/rb/spec/integration/selenium/webdriver/element_spec.rb#L200
[2015-08-28 09:28:02] titusfortner: so, that's tag name support
[2015-08-28 09:28:32] titusfortner: and this passed for id support verification: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/rb/spec/integration/selenium/webdriver/element_spec.rb#L200
[2015-08-28 09:28:52] dude-x: i knew it, there's a css mafia! i am vindicated
[2015-08-28 09:29:31] titusfortner: css mafia is powerful, someone had to show me a bunch of speed bench marks to convince me that xpath was just as fast
[2015-08-28 09:30:34] dude-x: titusfortner: speed benchmarks against which browser?

[2015-08-28 10:14:42] GforOevOerD: I know I can use selenium waits, but I found that the statements proceed after the driver has fully loaded the page and it's contents. Since the webpage use too many external sources other than dom, it takes so much to all of the contents get loaded.

[2015-08-28 10:30:52] GforOevOerD: lukeis Exactly!
[2015-08-28 10:31:02] dude-x: say if it uses jquery among one of the js libraries
[2015-08-28 10:31:17] dude-x: you can use jquery to check if there are ongoing ajax transactions are occuring

[2015-08-28 11:10:41] harbhub: currently i know js, html, c#, css
[2015-08-28 11:10:41] dude-x: yes learn python
[2015-08-28 11:10:49] harbhub: why?
[2015-08-28 11:10:57] dude-x: so you know C#
[2015-08-28 11:11:01] dude-x: and you javascript
[2015-08-28 11:11:22] harbhub: yes i know those
[2015-08-28 11:11:23] dude-x: imagine something that is nice like C# and less weird than javascript, that's Python
[2015-08-28 11:11:27] harbhub: python should be a breeze to learn
[2015-08-28 11:11:44] dude-x: yeah you can learn the basics in 1-3 days
[2015-08-28 11:11:47] mostrosonido, quitting. (Quit: mostrosonido)
[2015-08-28 11:11:53] harbhub: cool
[2015-08-28 11:11:56] harbhub: lots of jobs?
[2015-08-28 11:11:57] ET1: harbhub: you have knowledge in web and OOP already, so you probably should pick up a powerful scripting language like python or ruby that has libraries for almost everything and fast development
[2015-08-28 11:12:06] dude-x: harbhub: yes, depends where you live
[2015-08-28 11:12:07] harbhub: et1 i use nodejs
[2015-08-28 11:12:24] harbhub: also has libs for everything i need and super fast dev
[2015-08-28 11:12:28] dude-x: in the US, lots of places uses python
[2015-08-28 11:12:38] harbhub: plus lots of stuff i can use in the browser and in nodejs, like chai!
[2015-08-28 11:12:40] dude-x: other countries, python may be rare, but it can pay a lot because its rare
[2015-08-28 11:12:48] harbhub: cool dude-x
[2015-08-28 11:13:45] ET1: harbhub: node.js is great and I have worked with it a bit, but python can do more things I believe. For example, I've tried working with Kinect and image processing in python and it worked out pretty well. This is not something node can do
[2015-08-28 11:14:10] harbhub: kinect?  that xbox thing?
[2015-08-28 11:14:29] harbhub: pretty sure that is currently a dead technology lol microsoft even folded on making it mandatory
[2015-08-28 11:14:36] harbhub: because, well, it is a complete failure
[2015-08-28 11:14:47] dude-x: node.js is fast, but it's javascript, and it has bugs; javascript is not a nice language to do complex layering of code
[2015-08-28 11:14:49] harbhub: (from what i've read/heard)
[2015-08-28 11:15:04] harbhub: dude-x, promises are helping that though
[2015-08-28 11:15:05] harbhub: and ecma6
[2015-08-28 11:15:16] harbhub: and the functional stuff like map, reduce, filter
[2015-08-28 11:15:20] dude-x: yeah, but this will take time
[2015-08-28 11:15:21] harbhub: are becoming standards in js
[2015-08-28 11:15:34] harbhub: plus there is the babel + iojs stuff
[2015-08-28 11:15:41] harbhub: which seems promising (pun intended)
[2015-08-28 11:15:55] harbhub: hmm
[2015-08-28 11:16:09] dude-x: python has a rich library for you to do all kinds of work
[2015-08-28 11:16:10] harbhub: i've done complex stuff in js before
[2015-08-28 11:16:30] ET1: yeah, python is maturer and many bugs are addressed. And code in python is very conventional aka pythonic, so you can really do things in one way which can be more maintainable
[2015-08-28 11:16:32] harbhub: i wrote a monte carlo simulation tool in it for project planning (estimating times and critical paths)

[2015-08-28 11:16:39] dude-x: i'm not saying it's hard to do complex stuff, just that complex stuff becomes a bit harder to reason about because of JS wtf's
[2015-08-28 11:16:53] harbhub: lol js has some fun wtfs
[2015-08-28 11:17:01] harbhub: part of why it keeps me interested and challenged
[2015-08-28 11:17:17] harbhub: c# i criticize for being "too easy", whatever that means
[2015-08-28 11:17:30] harbhub: strongly typed making it difficult to mess up ever
[2015-08-28 11:17:53] harbhub: which sure it is a good thing but for some reason i like loosely typed javascript more hmm
[2015-08-28 11:18:00] harbhub: python is definitely what i will learn next
[2015-08-28 11:18:08] harbhub: hopefully it opens my eyes more to what you are talking about
[2015-08-28 11:18:17] harbhub: so i can see the good in it and have more to compare js against  (:
[2015-08-28 11:18:22] harbhub: (and nodejs)
[2015-08-28 11:18:28] harbhub: thanks youve convinced me hehe
[2015-08-28 11:20:23] ET1: harbhub: good luck and let me what you think about how python stacks up with node later :)
[2015-08-28 11:20:29] ET1: let me know*
[2015-08-28 11:20:49] dude-x: harbhub: perl is good to learn for the regex part
[2015-08-28 11:21:12] dude-x: other parts of the language are less than ideal, too many symbols, too many ways to express something
[2015-08-28 11:21:24] harbhub: python and perl were the two i was considering
[2015-08-28 11:21:32] harbhub: also C which i surely will learn at some point
[2015-08-28 11:21:38] harbhub: from the K&R book that hear good things about
[2015-08-28 11:21:42] harbhub: i will et1  (:
[2015-08-28 11:22:04] harbhub: the only way to truly gauge how python stacks up against node is to become an expert in both  (:
[2015-08-28 11:22:18] harbhub: and to actually write complex applications in both and use them to their full potential

[2015-08-28 11:29:59] harbhub: what are you using it with? nodejs? python?
[2015-08-28 11:30:11] Kash_: html.. firefox plugin
[2015-08-28 11:30:20] jimevans: harbhub: none. Kash_ is probably using selenium ide
[2015-08-28 11:30:22] sircapsalot: the ide
[2015-08-28 11:30:25] Kash_: yeah
[2015-08-28 11:30:26] harbhub: so selenium webdriver or selenium server?
[2015-08-28 11:30:31] jimevans: in which case, i tap out
[2015-08-28 11:30:32] sircapsalot: neither :)
[2015-08-28 11:30:33] Kash_: IDE
[2015-08-28 11:30:38] harbhub: i also tap out, i'm sorry
[2015-08-28 11:30:46] harbhub: i can help only with the nodejs workflow
[2015-08-28 11:30:48] jimevans: don't use it, won't use it, despise it.
[2015-08-28 11:30:50] harbhub: :/
[2015-08-28 11:30:57] sircapsalot: and i'm in a meeting.. can't dedicate!
[2015-08-28 11:31:02] Kash_: oh sure
[2015-08-28 11:31:03] sircapsalot: (at this particular moment)
[2015-08-28 11:31:07] Kash_: no problem
[2015-08-28 11:31:20] sircapsalot: if nobody gets to you, i'll help you out when i get out of this meeting.
[2015-08-28 11:32:08] Kash_: thanks.. It's abit frustrating. It's like when you are learning to write programming and you can't get the most basic task down. "Hello World"
[2015-08-28 11:32:31] Kash_: cant understand where im going wrong
