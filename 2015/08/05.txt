[2015-08-05 02:51:03] pauluchon: It only happens when I set requireWindowFocus to TRUE. Any workarround to avoid this ?

[2015-08-05 02:54:34] pauluchon: It is just after opening ie and all other windows are minimized, so I thing yes
[2015-08-05 02:54:47] pauluchon: think*
[2015-08-05 02:59:12] pauluchon: WhereIsMySpoon: I just check it out and I think you're right, if I perform manual click on browser before it calls sendKeys() it works

[2015-08-05 07:42:17] WhereIsMySpoon: you could replace your simple sendKeys with a fluent wait that does sendKeys then checks the contents of the field, if it doesnt equal the string you sent, empty it and sendKeys again
[2015-08-05 07:44:20] pauluchon: You really master Sellenium WhereIsMySpoon, that's a good idea.thank's again for your help

[2015-08-05 07:47:04] brockfredin, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-05 07:50:04] WhereIsMySpoon: dude-x: because usually input fields behave normally?
[2015-08-05 07:50:14] WhereIsMySpoon: pauluchon: hope it helps
[2015-08-05 07:50:33] dude-x: but i have seen it just type things and have it miss the first letter or the last
[2015-08-05 07:50:42] dude-x: but yeah it's not a common problem
[2015-08-05 07:51:03] WhereIsMySpoon: dude-x: fluent waits are awesome for first-time failures
[2015-08-05 07:51:12] WhereIsMySpoon: or even second or third time failures
[2015-08-05 07:51:16] sgsabbage: dude-x: yeah, I've seen that too, and in fact have the same function that WhereIsMySpoon described above to cope. Except it's only in one input field
[2015-08-05 07:51:27] pauluchon: WhereIsMySpoon: Yes, it did ! Works great
[2015-08-05 07:51:57] brockfredin: Anyone know why a knockout bound textbox might not always work for a Selenium based test?

[2015-08-05 09:00:54] Shayanjm: hi all, I'm using Selenium (on python) in tandem with RQ to do some scaled scraping. I've got a pretty simple function that executes on each worker where it essentially creates a phantomjs driver, does some stuff, driver.quit()'s, and then returns.
[2015-08-05 09:01:08] dolu1, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2015-08-05 09:01:43] Shayanjm: My assumption is that by .quit()ing the driver it should free everything up (so I should only ever have x phantomjs processes running, where x is # of active workers)
[2015-08-05 09:02:21] dude-x: :apidocs
[2015-08-05 09:02:26] Shayanjm: but in reality it spins up hundreds/thousands of phantomjs instances, eats up all of the memory, and then locks me out of the box.
[2015-08-05 09:03:17] Shayanjm: Am I right in assuming that this isn't the expected behavior? I haven't been able to find anything online about this.
[2015-08-05 09:03:29] dude-x: do you have the latest python client?
[2015-08-05 09:03:34] simonstewart: nirvdrum: coming to SeConf?

[2015-08-05 09:03:53] dude-x: Shayanjm: the latest client is 2.47.1

[2015-08-05 09:04:28] Shayanjm: I can check
[2015-08-05 09:04:34] WhereIsMySpoon: Shayanjm: .quit() should close the process and all sub processes
[2015-08-05 09:04:56] Shayanjm: WhereIsMySpoon: that's what I assumed too, but it's not doing that. let me verify the package version though
[2015-08-05 09:05:20] Shayanjm: dude-x: yeah it's running 2.47.1

[2015-08-05 18:06:25] sevaseva: AutomatedTester: Hey, I'm back to my desk.. No, jleyba isn't on vacation
[2015-08-05 18:06:45] AutomatedTester: sevaseva: ok, I have sent him an email anyway
[2015-08-05 18:06:46] sevaseva: He reviewed a change a couple of days ago and looks like he was online today
[2015-08-05 18:06:59] AutomatedTester: cool
[2015-08-05 18:07:04] AutomatedTester: is Friday your last day?
[2015-08-05 18:07:24] sevaseva: yeahhh :) I'm sure I'll sleep after that :)
[2015-08-05 18:07:40] sevaseva: trying to finish everything I didn't finish all these years :)
[2015-08-05 18:08:08] AutomatedTester: sevaseva: is your replacement going to visit us here?
[2015-08-05 18:08:55] AutomatedTester: sevaseva: also, maybe send an intro email to the dev mailing list
[2015-08-05 18:09:32] sevaseva: eventually - definitely. Josh and JasonJ are still thinking if they want to join Sam in the Japan f2f, I'm trying to convince they do :)
[2015-08-05 18:11:27] sevaseva: yep, we will see about an email. I think Josh just needs more excuses to do a little work in Selenium, if he has excuses we will do a great job there (as he does elsewhere)
[2015-08-05 18:12:10] sevaseva: of course, as usual, internal work is higher priority most of the time here....
[2015-08-05 18:12:42] sevaseva: but Josh works very many hours a day so I'm sure he'll show his work here too :)
[2015-08-05 18:13:07] juangj: yeah, somebody tell josh to work less
[2015-08-05 18:13:37] juangj: at some point i need to fix my irssi theme so i notice when i get nickflashed
