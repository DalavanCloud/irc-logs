[2015-08-25 02:02:24] leopld: Hey everyone, I've been working a bit with Selenium, but not familiar with its inner workings to any greater extent. I'm trying to run multiple instances of selenium webdriver + phantomjs in node, but even though several instances can't start up in parallel, only one at a time does any work. How can I run the instances in parallel?

[2015-08-25 02:15:41] WhereIsMySpoon: Maitre2B: have you imported the By class?
[2015-08-25 02:15:48] WhereIsMySpoon: Maitre2B: you using eclipse?
[2015-08-25 02:16:30] aimmac23: leopld: aren't you using only one WebDriver instance for that?
[2015-08-25 02:16:54] WhereIsMySpoon: leopld: the guy who answered has given you the correct answer
[2015-08-25 02:17:03] WhereIsMySpoon: you need to use remote webdriver and Grid
[2015-08-25 02:17:57] aimmac23: I'm not sure that he NEEDS to, but it would probably help
[2015-08-25 02:18:02] WhereIsMySpoon: no, he needs to
[2015-08-25 02:18:12] WhereIsMySpoon: you cannot start more than one local instance at any one time
[2015-08-25 02:18:46] Maitre2B: WhereIsMySpoon: Yes i'm using eclipse
[2015-08-25 02:18:57] WhereIsMySpoon: Maitre2B: press ctrl-shift-o

[2015-08-25 02:44:09] WhereIsMySpoon: leopld: long story short - you need to use remote webdriver and grid to do parallel runs
[2015-08-25 02:45:27] aimmac23: that's not actually his problem - he needs to have more than one client-side thread
[2015-08-25 02:45:49] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-25 02:45:53] WhereIsMySpoon: thats true too
[2015-08-25 02:45:53] aimmac23: its perfectly possible to run multiple instances of a selenium browser locally without using grid
[2015-08-25 02:46:16] WhereIsMySpoon: really?
[2015-08-25 02:46:18] WhereIsMySpoon: hm
[2015-08-25 02:46:19] aimmac23: yes
[2015-08-25 02:46:21] leopld: aimmac23: how would I go about doing it?
[2015-08-25 02:46:24] eteixeira, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-25 02:46:31] aimmac23: I did that at work before moving over to using the Grid
[2015-08-25 02:47:03] WhereIsMySpoon: grid provides better load balancing over multiple nodes though
[2015-08-25 02:47:17] aimmac23: Selenium grid just adds some extra bits and pieces on top - in the end you can still have Grid nodes launching multiple browsers at once
[2015-08-25 02:47:31] aimmac23: WhereIsMySpoon - yup, that it does :)
[2015-08-25 02:47:42] aimmac23: leopld: no idea, I'm afraid - Javascript is not really my thing
[2015-08-25 02:49:15] leopld: aimmac23: hmm alright, but where should I look? Like what exactly is it that I would want to configure?
[2015-08-25 02:49:47] WhereIsMySpoon: you need to either find a js test framework that will automatically multithread test runs
[2015-08-25 02:49:53] WhereIsMySpoon: or manually spin up threads
[2015-08-25 02:51:11] aimmac23: leopld: I'm afraid I can only google for answers - according to this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2387724/node-js-on-multi-core-machines you need to spin up multiple processes
[2015-08-25 02:52:32] leopld: ah okay, thanks both of you! And if I were to set up remote webdriver + grid, that means configuring grid as a separate server that remote webdriver connects to and grid takes care of spawning however many browsers, or something like that?
[2015-08-25 02:54:00] aimmac23: but someone who knows more about node.js can probably advise you better
[2015-08-25 02:54:00] aimmac23: corect
[2015-08-25 02:54:01] aimmac23: *correct
[2015-08-25 02:54:23] aimmac23: but I think the Webdriver API expects you to have one thread per browser instance, so you would still need to have something for multithreading/multiprocess
[2015-08-25 02:57:28] leopld: hmm okay, so even if I set up Grid I'll have to spawn more processes to run the tests in parallel?
[2015-08-25 02:59:44] aimmac23: yup
[2015-08-25 02:59:44] aimmac23: I think its easier to spin up threads in Python, fwiw :P
[2015-08-25 02:59:44] aimmac23: (if you have the flexibility to change languages)
[2015-08-25 03:01:39] WhereIsMySpoon: leopld: grid gives you the ability to manage and balance parallel selenium processes, it does not actually give the implementation for the creation of such
[2015-08-25 03:01:41] WhereIsMySpoon: that is up to you
[2015-08-25 03:02:27] WhereIsMySpoon: leopld: grid really starts to become useful when you have either multiple nodes or you need to have the hub and node(s) on separate machines
[2015-08-25 03:02:41] leopld: aimmac23: sadly I'm not able to pick languages at this point, but I do think this kind of territory is kind of in the margins of what node is a good fit for, though, but spinning up new processes isn't that much of a pain either. Thanks for the help!
[2015-08-25 03:03:00] aimmac23: you're welcome :)
[2015-08-25 03:03:29] leopld: WhereIsMySpoon: ok, I see - so grid also expects to communicate 1-to-1 between a browser that it has spawned and a selenium client thread?
[2015-08-25 03:04:31] WhereIsMySpoon: yes, each instance of WebDriver is a new browser instance
[2015-08-25 03:05:13] WhereIsMySpoon: and obviously you should only have one instance of webdriver per thread
[2015-08-25 03:05:29] WhereIsMySpoon: so by extension yes you're correct
[2015-08-25 03:07:06] dubner_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-25 03:07:12] leopld: Alright, well I understand the problem now, thanks again! I think setting up Grid would be to overdo it a bit in my case, I'll try and simple spawn a new node process for each test I need to run
[2015-08-25 03:07:21] WhereIsMySpoon: alrighty
[2015-08-25 03:07:22] WhereIsMySpoon: good luck
[2015-08-25 03:07:29] WhereIsMySpoon: also phantomjs is the devil
[2015-08-25 03:07:31] WhereIsMySpoon: just sayin
[2015-08-25 03:07:39] leopld: haha how so?
[2015-08-25 03:07:39] WhereIsMySpoon: when used with selenium that is
[2015-08-25 03:07:46] WhereIsMySpoon: it doesnt behave nicely
[2015-08-25 03:07:48] WhereIsMySpoon: and it isnt a browser
[2015-08-25 03:07:55] WhereIsMySpoon: your selenium tests are E2E tests
[2015-08-25 03:08:01] WhereIsMySpoon: no client is using phantomjs
[2015-08-25 03:08:09] WhereIsMySpoon: so you're already not testing the actual product
[2015-08-25 03:08:18] WhereIsMySpoon: phantomjs also doesnt deal with certain things like alerts well
[2015-08-25 03:08:21] WhereIsMySpoon: and it uses a different js engine
[2015-08-25 03:08:56] WhereIsMySpoon: i started trying to use it and ended up creating different code paths for phantomjs and other browsers
[2015-08-25 03:08:57] leopld: that's true, but my tests aren't really tests either - really what I need to do is scrape data from a page as it appears in a browser, so I just need a lightweight headless browser. Think phantomjs is a good fit in that case?
[2015-08-25 03:09:05] WhereIsMySpoon: oh right
[2015-08-25 03:09:08] WhereIsMySpoon: yea sure then
[2015-08-25 03:09:21] WhereIsMySpoon: you can make the other browsers headless too :)
[2015-08-25 03:09:24] WhereIsMySpoon: using xvfb
[2015-08-25 03:09:34] WhereIsMySpoon: but if u just wanna scrape then no need, pjs will work

[2015-08-25 03:38:16] barancev|2: start two different browsers

[2015-08-25 03:38:43] zank: only Firefox is okay
[2015-08-25 03:39:15] CTtpollard: selenium affectively is a private session

[2015-08-25 03:39:26] CTtpollard: each instance is a new profile
[2015-08-25 03:39:30] zank: Oh ?

[2015-08-25 03:40:13] barancev|2: yes, a clean profile each time
[2015-08-25 03:40:26] zank: Great !
[2015-08-25 03:40:37] CTtpollard: or if you really want a a private session, try something like firefox_profile.set_preference("browser.privatebrowsing.autostart", True)
[2015-08-25 03:41:02] zank: oookay, i'll try that and find the rest on google :)

[2015-08-25 07:03:24] WhereIsMySpoon: just cause u can change your ip and use a vpn doesnt make you untraceable

[2015-08-25 07:05:45] barancev: WhereIsMySpoon: I said selenium itself does not touch network settings

[2015-08-25 07:42:58] dude-x: Biswa: selenium will autoscroll to an element if it has to click it, or type into it
[2015-08-25 07:43:22] Biswa: suppose the element i am searching for is there at bottom part of the screen then also by using locator we can find that element and do operation then is it required to scroll down the page for that element

[2015-08-25 15:50:50] dude-x: godzirra: i found this site: http://docsplendid.com/archives/209
[2015-08-25 15:50:54] godzirra: When I change it to this, it tells me invalid locator:  driver.findElement(webdriver.By.name('Twitter Share'));
[2015-08-25 15:51:05] dude-x: this seems a bit more familiar to the code i saw from my co-worker
[2015-08-25 15:51:27] godzirra: interesting.
[2015-08-25 15:53:00] godzirra: This still gets me invalid locator:     driver.wait(driver.findElement(webdriver.By.name('Twitter Share')).isPresent);
[2015-08-25 15:53:23] dude-x: try by css selector
[2015-08-25 15:53:26] dude-x: it's faster anyway
[2015-08-25 15:53:29] godzirra: But oddly, not until after the javascript loads the embed
[2015-08-25 15:53:47] dude-x: is it in an iframe or frame?
[2015-08-25 15:53:49] godzirra: There's no css selector I can use.
[2015-08-25 15:53:53] godzirra: It's not an iframe
[2015-08-25 15:53:55] godzirra: but that's next. p
[2015-08-25 15:53:56] godzirra: ;p
[2015-08-25 15:54:04] dude-x: sure you can
[2015-08-25 15:54:07] dude-x: you just wrote it
[2015-08-25 15:54:14] dude-x: a[name="Twitter Share"]
[2015-08-25 15:54:18] godzirra: Oh.
[2015-08-25 15:54:20] godzirra: Okay.
[2015-08-25 15:54:35] godzirra: webdriver.By.name isn't what I should use though. Should I go back to $('selector')?
[2015-08-25 15:55:26] godzirra: Hm.  I thought thsi should work:      driver.wait(driver.findElement(webdriver.By.css("a[name='Twitter Share']")).isPresent);
[2015-08-25 15:55:29] godzirra: same error though.
[2015-08-25 15:57:06] dude-x: can you add a sleep before that line of like 2 seconds?
[2015-08-25 15:57:28] Danjo1, quitting. (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[2015-08-25 15:58:04] godzirra: Sure, but should I have to?
[2015-08-25 15:58:55] godzirra: There's no sleep... do you mean setTimeout?
[2015-08-25 15:58:58] godzirra: to run the driver?
