[2015-08-17 02:36:00] pauluchon: EdwardIII: I saw your experienced the "PHPUnit_Extensions_Selenium2TestCase_NoSeleniumException: Error connection[28]". I'm facing the same issue, did you manage to find a solution ?
[2015-08-17 02:36:26] EdwardIII: pauluchon: heh that must have been a loooong time ago eh?
[2015-08-17 02:36:55] EdwardIII: pauluchon: sounds like selenium just isn't running
[2015-08-17 02:37:09] EdwardIII: p.s. i'm moving away to that towards facebook's php api
[2015-08-17 02:38:30] pauluchon: EdwardIII: I found some irc log where you was asking for similar issue
[2015-08-17 02:38:49] pauluchon: Do you advice me to move away too ?
[2015-08-17 02:39:03] EdwardIII: pauluchon: hmm well i found PHPUnit_Extensions_Selenium2TestCase to not be very good
[2015-08-17 02:39:10] sgsabbage: (it's awful)

[2015-08-17 02:41:14] EdwardIII: well ye
[2015-08-17 02:41:15] EdwardIII: s
[2015-08-17 02:41:17] sgsabbage: probably something with https://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver/blob/community/lib/WebDriverSelect.php
[2015-08-17 02:41:33] pauluchon: sgabbage: I'm still kind of a newbie with selenium, could you explain me why it's so awful ?
[2015-08-17 02:42:00] EdwardIII: sgsabbage: yeah my issue is i don't know how to get/manipulate/turn-an-object-into WebDriverSelect
[2015-08-17 02:42:40] EdwardIII: sgsabbage: i just kept running into weird bugs and issues like it being exceedingly difficult, for example, to inject a custom firefox profile
[2015-08-17 02:43:11] sgsabbage: new WebDriverSelect(<element>) I think
[2015-08-17 02:43:36] EdwardIII: hmm lemme try that
[2015-08-17 02:44:05] sgsabbage: I have no idea how that semi-colon got in there, if you can see it. My IRC client is being weird
[2015-08-17 02:44:24] EdwardIII: i can't see it
[2015-08-17 02:44:38] sgsabbage: pauluchon: It's not kept up to date
[2015-08-17 02:44:45] EdwardIII: funny how facebook chose not to use namespaces heh
[2015-08-17 02:44:52] sgsabbage: they're slowly getting there
[2015-08-17 02:44:53] EdwardIII: FACEBOOK DAMNIT STOP TEACHING THE COMMUNITY BAD HABBITS
[2015-08-17 02:45:14] sgsabbage: last commit to the Selenium2TestCase Extension was 9 months ago, and I know there has been new stuff added to webdriver since
[2015-08-17 02:46:53] sgsabbage: and the documentation is massively out of date
[2015-08-17 02:48:20] sgsabbage: for ex, the README says "This package contains a base Testcase Class that can be used to run end-to-end tests against Selenium 2 (using its Selenium 1 backward compatible Api)." - not true, it uses WebDriver
[2015-08-17 02:49:11] EdwardIII: heh this facebook api is kind of horribly verbose
[2015-08-17 02:49:34] EdwardIII: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/bece923662f0ac38bfd9
[2015-08-17 02:49:47] EdwardIII: why not just return the select element?
[2015-08-17 02:50:51] sgsabbage: it's modeled heavily after the Java API
[2015-08-17 02:51:30] EdwardIII: why doesn't the java api just return a select element?
[2015-08-17 02:51:44] pauluchon: sgsabbage: So I should rewrite all my code ? I've got a lot of helpers, and a page object. I think it would take me a month to rewrite all..
[2015-08-17 02:52:43] EdwardIII: i think you'll end up rewriting it anyway
[2015-08-17 02:53:21] sgsabbage: pauluchon: what you do is entirely up to you. I'm just saying that the Selenium2TestCase extension is not very good

[2015-08-17 02:54:15] pauluchon: Yeah, it just sounds like bad news for me.. I should ask advice here sooner
[2015-08-17 02:55:08] sgsabbage: EdwardIII: why would you want the select element returned? All it is is a helper class to click on a specific option
[2015-08-17 02:55:26] sgsabbage: I'm pretty sure you could just pick the option yourself using CSS or XPath and just ->click() it
[2015-08-17 02:55:47] sgsabbage: reading through the WebDriverSelect.php class, that's all it does anywya
[2015-08-17 02:55:59] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-08-17 02:57:04] EdwardIII: sgsabbage: well so you can select a particular element, e.g. <option> with the index 20 or value="biscuits" or text="bungholio" or so forth
[2015-08-17 02:57:11] EdwardIII: oh using css
[2015-08-17 02:57:14] EdwardIII: or xpath yeah
[2015-08-17 02:57:20] EdwardIII: ok maybe that's a better way actually
[2015-08-17 02:58:35] WhereIsMySpoon: EdwardIII: because the Select class is part of the support package and not the main selenium package
[2015-08-17 02:58:48] WhereIsMySpoon: thats why it doesnt return a select object
[2015-08-17 02:59:28] WhereIsMySpoon: the select class is just a helper class wrapper, its not really meant to be thought of as another type of WebElement
[2015-08-17 03:01:14] EdwardIII: right ok that makes sense
[2015-08-17 03:01:40] EdwardIII: striving for correctness and loose coupling is something i'm not used to seeing in PHP libraries heh
[2015-08-17 03:01:52] WhereIsMySpoon: >.<
[2015-08-17 03:01:59] EdwardIII: my newest developer is pushing to start moving over to java swing for some web stuff
[2015-08-17 03:02:11] WhereIsMySpoon: swing?
[2015-08-17 03:02:14] WhereIsMySpoon: u mean spring?
[2015-08-17 03:02:18] WhereIsMySpoon: swing is the GUI stuff
[2015-08-17 03:02:18] EdwardIII: heh yeah sorry
[2015-08-17 03:02:22] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2015-08-17 03:02:26] WhereIsMySpoon: bit of a difference
[2015-08-17 03:02:27] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-08-17 03:02:35] EdwardIII: pff it's all interface stuff
[2015-08-17 03:02:39] WhereIsMySpoon: >_>
[2015-08-17 03:02:47] WhereIsMySpoon: spring has nothing really to do with interfaces
[2015-08-17 03:03:02] WhereIsMySpoon: its just an app framework

[2015-08-17 03:12:23] pauluchon: sgsabbage: Dummy question, but how do you run test with the facebook bindings ? Do you still use PHPUnit ?

[2015-08-17 03:23:08] pauluchon: Thank's for your answers. I'm really thinking about migrating to facebook bindings, but it's not up to me.

[2015-08-17 04:50:14] EdwardIII: i've made a profile in firefox where it accepts the test SSL certificate
[2015-08-17 04:50:19] EdwardIII: so i have a copy of that
[2015-08-17 04:50:25] EdwardIII: FirefoxProfile doesn't work that way, does it, heh

[2015-08-17 04:50:56] EdwardIII: i'm not sure but i don't think firefox has "accept all ssl certificates invalid or not forever" option any more. i can't find it anywhere via the firefox interface anyway
[2015-08-17 04:51:30] sgsabbage: I have no idea if this page is useful or not
[2015-08-17 04:51:31] sgsabbage: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/UntrustedSSLCertificates

[2015-08-17 04:52:41] EdwardIII: trying that now

[2015-08-17 05:58:38] sgsabbage: wait, which driver are you using>
[2015-08-17 05:58:57] EdwardIII: facebook php
[2015-08-17 05:58:59] sgsabbage: because I can see you're using \WebDriverCapabilities
[2015-08-17 05:59:03] sgsabbage: but the namespace for it is Facebook\WebDriver\WebDriverCapabilities
[2015-08-17 05:59:36] EdwardIII: sgsabbage: my version doesn't even have any namespaces
[2015-08-17 05:59:45] sgsabbage: which version are you using?
[2015-08-17 05:59:53] EdwardIII: i just did composer require --dev facebook/webdriver
[2015-08-17 05:59:57] EdwardIII: "facebook/webdriver": "dev-master"

[2015-08-17 06:00:19] EdwardIII: heh er
[2015-08-17 06:00:22] sgsabbage: let me look at packagist, that's confusing
[2015-08-17 06:00:25] EdwardIII: well i'll happily switch
[2015-08-17 06:00:44] sgsabbage: no, that's the right one
[2015-08-17 06:00:50] sgsabbage: because composer
[2015-08-17 06:00:56] sgsabbage: https://packagist.org/packages/facebook/webdriver
[2015-08-17 06:01:02] sgsabbage: 1.0.0 was when namespaces were added
[2015-08-17 06:01:29] EdwardIII: dev-master should be newer than 1.x right?
[2015-08-17 06:01:53] sgsabbage: you say that
[2015-08-17 06:02:00] sgsabbage: but they changed the branch name to 'community'
[2015-08-17 06:02:11] sgsabbage: dev-master is still pointing at the master branch
[2015-08-17 06:02:16] EdwardIII: lemme switch to "~1.0"

[2015-08-17 06:11:38] jecran: WhereIsMySpoon: it loads chrome just fine and performs multiple key presses, but firefox just opens and no key presses. Will post the code in 1 moment
[2015-08-17 06:12:22] WhereIsMySpoon: jecran: webdriver? what version of webdriver and what version of ff?

[2015-08-17 06:18:22] sgsabbage: nono, you want FirefoxDriver::Profile

[2015-08-17 12:54:15] adisaraf: Hey All, I am running Selenium RC 1.0.2 and had a question about the proxyInjectionMode. When I am running the RC with in proxyInjectionMode, the browser (Firefox 3.6.6) seems to open the commands and the actual page in the same window. When I run the RC without proxyInjectionMode then 2 a separate window is opened for the page load. Any idea why this might be the case?
[2015-08-17 12:54:28] lukeis: whoaâ€¦.
[2015-08-17 12:54:36] lukeis: No More RC!
[2015-08-17 12:55:00] lukeis: and is firefox 3.6.6 like 5+ years old?
[2015-08-17 12:55:21] voodoofish430: maybe it's 36.6?
[2015-08-17 12:55:28] adisaraf: Haha, yes I am running a very old version of Selenium and a Firefox version that is no longer supported.
[2015-08-17 12:55:38] adisaraf: I actually did mean 3.6.6
[2015-08-17 12:55:43] voodoofish430: nm then....
[2015-08-17 12:55:46] voodoofish430: good luck...
[2015-08-17 12:55:59] adisaraf: :) I was hoping for some luck here
[2015-08-17 12:56:19] lukeis: not likely to get itâ€¦ everyone is suggested to use WebDriver nowadays
[2015-08-17 12:56:29] voodoofish430: ---^

[2015-08-17 13:00:30] lukeis: yeah, i believe jimevans ended his IE6 support a while agoâ€¦ need to confer with him and i'll update SeleniumHQ

[2015-08-17 13:02:53] joshbruning: It's when that flag I added will be removed. Then we can only used a signed extension... I for one build from source, so I don't think that would work for us. Mozilla posted on the Selenium IDE bug that they were working to get a signed copy of that.
