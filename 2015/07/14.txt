[2015-07-14 08:59:59] WhereIsMySpoon: mekhami: cookies?
[2015-07-14 09:00:07] jimevans: mekhami: if logging in sets a cookie, then you can navigate to the login page (because it'll be on the right domain), set the cookie, navigate to the page behind the authentication wall, and bob's your uncle.
[2015-07-14 09:00:25] WhereIsMySpoon: bob's everywhere..

[2015-07-14 09:00:44] mekhami: WhereIsMySpoon: yeah, I'm just saying what's the best way to do this? how does the driver take cookies
[2015-07-14 09:00:55] errant_rider: mekhami: i have a way
[2015-07-14 09:00:58] jimevans: driver.add_cookie() ?
[2015-07-14 09:01:05] errant_rider: where I auth once, store the cookie info in the DB, and then add_cookie into new instance
[2015-07-14 09:01:16] D3M0S:     webDriver.manage().addCookie();
[2015-07-14 09:01:18] mekhami: jimevans: why was i not able to find this in the python selenium docs idk
[2015-07-14 09:01:29] errant_rider: so we only have to auth at the start of a test run
[2015-07-14 09:01:31] jimevans: i don't know from pythin
[2015-07-14 09:01:37] jimevans: or python either for that matter.
[2015-07-14 09:01:37] D3M0S: that's java, probably very similiar in python
[2015-07-14 09:02:03] jimevans: but given the "flattening" of the api prevalent in python and ruby, that's an educated guess.
[2015-07-14 09:02:57] mekhami: errant_rider: the DB? how/why are you accessing a DB?
[2015-07-14 09:03:22] errant_rider: mekhami: we have a test DB where we store all test results and other data
[2015-07-14 09:03:29] errant_rider: how to access the db, is left to you….
[2015-07-14 09:03:41] errant_rider: we store the cookies in the DB, and then on every new instance we pull them from the DB and pump them in

[2015-07-14 09:38:41] Basma, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2015-07-14 09:38:49] lukeis: upside? you get to use the selenium api? (for those that use it often and know it better)
[2015-07-14 09:39:05] Dave_B_: what problem are you trying to solve?
[2015-07-14 09:39:06] PCatinean: Never worked with it, just read about it two hours ago
[2015-07-14 09:39:46] lukeis: it's pretty simple api… and then you can have test scripts run 'headless' with phantomjs or with a real browser
[2015-07-14 09:40:06] PCatinean: Dave_B_, unfortunately it's complicated as well because 1. I have no idea what I'm doing mostly 2.I am constrained by a python framework that should follow certain guidelines and integrate with a custom continous integration software
[2015-07-14 09:40:17] PCatinean: The framework name is Odoo
[2015-07-14 09:40:38] PCatinean: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/tree/8.0/openerp/tests
[2015-07-14 09:40:55] PCatinean: and from what I see it runs phantomjs as a subprocess and all the good stuff like setting the session and everything needed is there
[2015-07-14 09:41:06] PCatinean: not sure if I should go with that approach or try to implement selenium somehow
[2015-07-14 09:41:58] PCatinean: And I think that really cool feature to save screenshosts is from selenium
[2015-07-14 09:42:26] WhereIsMySpoon: i would advise against phantomjs
[2015-07-14 09:43:02] PCatinean: as a library or in conjunction with selenium WhereIsMySpoon ?
[2015-07-14 09:43:29] WhereIsMySpoon: uh, i mean the driver
[2015-07-14 09:43:38] WhereIsMySpoon: ghostdriver
[2015-07-14 09:43:59] WhereIsMySpoon: which is waht phantomjs uses
[2015-07-14 09:44:01] WhereIsMySpoon: i think
[2015-07-14 09:44:08] WhereIsMySpoon: but yea, in conjunction with selenium
[2015-07-14 09:44:16] WhereIsMySpoon: better to use chromdriver/firefoxdriver/iedriver
[2015-07-14 09:44:27] WhereIsMySpoon: phantomjs just doesnt work the same
[2015-07-14 09:44:27] PCatinean: I've heard warnings similar to this regarding selenium + phantomjs

[2015-07-14 09:44:47] WhereIsMySpoon: PCatinean: the reason why is pretty simple: how many of your users are using phantomjs to browse?
[2015-07-14 09:44:51] WhereIsMySpoon: my guess: 0
[2015-07-14 09:45:00] WhereIsMySpoon: hence, it wont be a valid testing of the app
[2015-07-14 09:45:10] PCatinean: Not sure why it's so popular, even twitter bootstrap uses it for development
[2015-07-14 09:45:11] kggr, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-14 09:45:18] WhereIsMySpoon: phantomjs uses a different JS engine than the other browsers so it wont behave the same
[2015-07-14 09:45:20] PCatinean: and bootstrap is really popular
[2015-07-14 09:45:31] PCatinean: and widely used
[2015-07-14 09:45:51] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont know about phantomjs on the library side, it's probably fine
[2015-07-14 09:46:04] WhereIsMySpoon: but with selenium you're trying to emulate the UI experience, and phantomjs doesnt do that
[2015-07-14 09:46:14] PCatinean: Yes you're right, I agree

[2015-07-14 09:53:14] jimevans: andpisco: the answer, like so many other things in life, is, "it depends"
[2015-07-14 09:53:34] jimevans: in theory, yes, it should, if you code to the interfaces and not to the implementations (assuming webdriver)
[2015-07-14 09:53:55] jimevans: (and ignoring selenium IDE, about which, the less said, the better)

[2015-07-14 09:59:35] sgsabbage: the biggest problem I have had with it is the known stuff around browser focus
[2015-07-14 09:59:59] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: performance is still sadly lacking though
[2015-07-14 10:00:04] jimevans: yeah, that's a native events thing. you can try turning native events off.
[2015-07-14 10:00:06] WhereIsMySpoon: for a native msft app
[2015-07-14 10:00:25] jimevans: err, that last was re: window focus, not perf.
[2015-07-14 10:00:25] WhereIsMySpoon: I'd expect it to outperform all the other browsers
[2015-07-14 10:00:32] WhereIsMySpoon: yea i got that :)
[2015-07-14 10:00:49] sgsabbage: we do multi-session testing, so will actually have two browser windows open at once
[2015-07-14 10:01:09] sgsabbage: ah, that is interesting - I admit the documentation I had been reading still says 'this is yet to be decided'
[2015-07-14 10:01:15] jimevans: well, that can be… problematic.
[2015-07-14 10:01:29] jimevans: sgsabbage: about the webdriver implementation?
[2015-07-14 10:01:43] sgsabbage: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver specifically
[2015-07-14 10:01:57] sgsabbage: under Browser Focus: "The discussion around the requirements of the driver and how to prioritize these two conflicting goals is ongoing. The current prevailing wisdom is to prioritize the former over the latter, and document that your machine will be unavailable for other tasks when using the IE driver. However, that decision is far from finalized, and the code to implement it is likely to be rather complicated."
[2015-07-14 10:02:39] sgsabbage: at least to my eyes, I didn't know you could turn native events off as a potential fix

[2015-07-14 10:08:33] sgsabbage: my apologies if you read it as a gripe at the driver - I was, as WhereIsMySpoon suggests, mainly more taking a cheap shot at IE ;)

[2015-07-14 12:12:15] lukeis: jimevans: so…. should i spend the afternoon seeing if i can figure out how to put that into the firefox driver? ;)
[2015-07-14 12:14:19] dude-x: lukeis: so that will be a thing soon? to authenticate with the alert machinery for basic auth?
[2015-07-14 12:14:37] jimevans: lukeis: oooh. that'd be shiny.
[2015-07-14 12:14:38] lukeis: i suppose so ;)
[2015-07-14 12:14:55] lukeis: it is volunteer week, right? ;)
[2015-07-14 12:14:59] jimevans: indeed it is.
[2015-07-14 12:19:01] jimevans: okay, quick API question.
[2015-07-14 12:19:15] jimevans: does the authenticateUsing() method imply clicking OK?
[2015-07-14 12:19:31] lukeis: i think so
[2015-07-14 12:19:37] jimevans: or does one still need to alert.accept()
[2015-07-14 12:20:06] jimevans: because there is the chance to dismiss the dialog, i suppose.
[2015-07-14 12:20:25] lukeis: hmmm
[2015-07-14 12:20:31] lukeis:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-07-14 12:20:40] lukeis: he who implements it first? ;)
[2015-07-14 12:20:53] jimevans: well the IE implementation doesn't imply an OK click. :)
[2015-07-14 12:21:19] lukeis: alert.authenticate(…); alert.accept();  is required?
[2015-07-14 12:21:27] jimevans: at the moment.
[2015-07-14 12:21:37] lukeis: i could go either way...
[2015-07-14 12:21:41] jimevans: hasn't been pushed yet, so could easily change.

[2015-07-14 12:34:31] AutomatedTester: jimevans: tbh I havent given it too much thought but it should probably look and feel like the alerts api for prompts/confirmations
[2015-07-14 12:34:48] AutomatedTester: at least that is where I would start
[2015-07-14 12:35:21] jimevans: well, right. but the prototype API in java is alert.authenticateUsing(credentials). does that method imply a click of the OK button? or is an additional alert.accept() required?
[2015-07-14 12:35:45] lukeis: i suppose a prompt, you have to alert.sendKeys and then alert.accept

[2015-07-14 12:37:18] AutomatedTester: but under the hood it should be sendKeys + accept

[2015-07-14 12:37:51] AutomatedTester: jimevans: think of it from the point of the vendor, we will need to be able to do negative tests

[2015-07-14 12:38:59] lukeis: so, i could update the javas and pythons to implicitly call accept in the method
[2015-07-14 12:39:28] jimevans: well, now hold on.
[2015-07-14 12:39:31] lukeis: ;)
[2015-07-14 12:39:37] *lukeis holds on tight!'
[2015-07-14 12:40:14] AutomatedTester: if you have a utility/support method like authenticateUsing(username, password) then it would do an implicit call
[2015-07-14 12:40:28] jimevans: just calling "sendKeys" on the alert doesn't make sense for the semantics of that method in the alert context. sendKeys assumes only one editable field on the alert, because a prompt only has one.

[2015-07-14 12:41:19] jimevans: a credential dialog usually has two editable fields.
[2015-07-14 12:43:07] jimevans: there's either going to have to be another end point, or the "POST /session/:sessionid/alert_text" end point is going to have to grow some additional functionality.

[2015-07-14 12:45:55] jimevans: i'm open to suggestions.
[2015-07-14 12:46:48] AutomatedTester: It definitely needs a new end point
[2015-07-14 12:47:40] AutomatedTester: so we could have authenticateUsing() and then need an explicit call to accept
[2015-07-14 12:48:01] jimevans: prototyping it, i've been using "POST /session/:sessionid/authenticate" with a payload of {"username": "foo", "password": "bar"} and requiring an explicit accept()

[2015-07-14 12:48:27] AutomatedTester: thats a great start
[2015-07-14 12:48:36] AutomatedTester: let's see how it holds up :)
[2015-07-14 12:48:47] lukeis: and I liked the idea of the client bindings implicitly calling accept when you call Alert.authenticateUsing
[2015-07-14 12:49:49] jimevans: well, maybe we change the end point to something like "POST /session/:sessionid/set_credentials"
[2015-07-14 12:49:52] AutomatedTester: the bindings can do that
[2015-07-14 12:50:08] jimevans: it would be more explicitly descriptive.
[2015-07-14 12:50:21] AutomatedTester: but if vendors dont want to do that then they don't need to use our bindings
[2015-07-14 12:50:34] AutomatedTester: e.g. there are marionette bindings in python at Mozilla

[2015-07-14 12:54:34] mekhami: so... going to the login page, setting the auth token in the header, and then navigating the page i need doesn't really save me much more time than just entering the form. i was wondering if there's a way to set up the entire test class this way so that I can save time on logging in for every test -case-
[2015-07-14 12:54:52] mekhami: what are my options here, because I'd like to subtract the 5+ seconds from every test required for the same login process
