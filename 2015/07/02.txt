[2015-07-02 09:48:17] enroxorz: Hello gentlepeople of selenium! I seek help with a question, one that has confounded me for over a day! Is there any way at all to download a file from a selenium grid node to your local machine? I know what I seek might be dumb, but right now it's the only way I can validate these reports because my developers refuse to change the mime-type so it opens in the browser. Help me, selenium room, you're my only hope!
[2015-07-02 09:49:54] WhereIsMySpoon: enroxorz: you mean from the node machine that is running the tests to the hub machine?

[2015-07-02 09:53:49] WhereIsMySpoon: enroxorz: what I do is use a simple http request and response inspector class to send the http response to download then inspect the response headers
[2015-07-02 09:54:11] WhereIsMySpoon: so i do everything selenium up till the point where i would click the download button
[2015-07-02 09:54:16] WhereIsMySpoon: then put the url that would do the download in that clas

[2015-07-02 10:01:06] lukeis: enroxorz: you can use an http client (in your language of choice) and 'download' the fileâ€¦ if it's an authenticated session, then you likely just need to make sure to pass the Session Cookie in the http header
[2015-07-02 10:01:44] lukeis: also :download
[2015-07-02 10:01:50] lukeis: :downloads
[2015-07-02 10:01:54] lukeis: that one ^ ;)
[2015-07-02 10:02:09] enroxorz: i found the rails post method that handles this. it returns the csv back so i will see if I can do that.

[2015-07-02 10:04:50] enroxorz: now here's the hundred dollar question, how do i do straight http posts from selenium without having to call curl?
[2015-07-02 10:05:05] lukeis: don't use selenium, don't use curl
[2015-07-02 10:05:16] lukeis: what language are you writing your selenium test in? ruby?
[2015-07-02 10:05:38] Dave_B_: presumably you're writing stuff in a programming language - that language will have some good libraries to do what you want
[2015-07-02 10:05:41] lukeis: :google ruby http request

[2015-07-02 10:07:16] Dave_B_: couple of wires and good timing, you can get those 1's and 0's

[2015-07-02 10:07:35] enroxorz: i have a http client for my tools written for the API Authentication for another system. I just need to figure out how to grab the right cookie data so i can mimic the browser via net-http
[2015-07-02 10:07:50] lukeis: aye, that's the trick :)
[2015-07-02 10:08:19] WhereIsMySpoon: enroxorz: selenium allows you to grab your current cookies iirc
[2015-07-02 10:08:29] WhereIsMySpoon: driver.manage().getAllCookies() ?
[2015-07-02 10:08:32] WhereIsMySpoon: something like that

[2015-07-02 12:37:57] jumanji: hey guys really need your help http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31123364/selenium-run-test-on-my-machine-remotely
[2015-07-02 12:41:34] Gerard: Are you using Selenium Grid to run your tests remotely?
[2015-07-02 12:43:07] jumanji: Gerard: no I am not
[2015-07-02 12:43:25] Gerard: Is Selenium Grid an option?
[2015-07-02 12:43:40] jumanji: Gerard: I thought I could run my test via remote webdriver by starting a chromedriver instance on any machine
[2015-07-02 12:43:56] jumanji: Gerard: I'll take a look at that
[2015-07-02 12:44:23] jumanji: Gerard: although it'd be sweet if I could just start chromedriver.exe on my windows machine and then from my linux server which has all the tests can run it on my local machine
[2015-07-02 12:44:24] Gerard: We use Selenium Grid and it's been working really well for us and it is easy to scale up/down
[2015-07-02 12:45:28] jumanji: Gerard: could you pull this off with grid?
[2015-07-02 12:45:35] Gerard: We recently tried that as well (for a JxBrowser application), but were unsuccessful. If you do get it to work, I'd be interested in your solution! :)
[2015-07-02 12:45:43] shawnknight: is the java bindings compiled in 7 or is it 8?
[2015-07-02 12:46:02] jumanji: Gerard: I used jxbrowser too long time ago but it was way too buggy
[2015-07-02 12:46:15] AutomatedTester: jumanji: you will need a remote webserver, chromedriver only works if the commands come from localhost
[2015-07-02 12:46:28] tony3, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-07-02 12:46:35] jumanji: AutomatedTester: but I thought you could accept non local connections by using the whitelist ip argument
[2015-07-02 12:46:48] AutomatedTester: no idea then
[2015-07-02 12:46:58] jumanji: chromedriver.exe --port=25000 --verbose --whitelisted-ips=""
[2015-07-02 12:47:22] Gerard: Yes, with Grid you can run your tests remotely on any browser. There are 3 components: the client machine (which would be your Linux server), the hub and one or more nodes. You could use 1 machine for hub/node though.
[2015-07-02 12:47:26] jumanji: https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=780
[2015-07-02 12:47:45] jumanji: Gerard: wish I knew about selenium sooner, I ended up writing my own
[2015-07-02 12:47:50] jumanji: selenium grid I mean
[2015-07-02 12:47:59] jumanji: I just use celery and rabbitmq to distribute tests
[2015-07-02 12:48:14] jumanji: but i wanted to run the test on my own machine for once
[2015-07-02 12:48:23] Gerard: http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/ -> use Selenium-server-standalone
[2015-07-02 12:48:28] Gerard: Ah ok
[2015-07-02 12:49:10] Gerard: Not immediately sure then. We couldn't get Chromedriver to accept remote connections either and only got it to accept commands from localhost
[2015-07-02 12:49:22] Gerard: It might be possible, but I'm not sure
[2015-07-02 12:49:42] jumanji: Gerard: crap
[2015-07-02 12:49:56] jumanji: Gerard: if I run selenium standalone server can it accept remote connections?
[2015-07-02 12:50:03] Gerard: Yup
[2015-07-02 12:50:29] Gerard: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Grid2
[2015-07-02 12:50:53] Gerard: That wiki describes how it all works
[2015-07-02 12:51:08] Gerard: It's pretty easy to set up and has been working really well for us
[2015-07-02 12:51:11] jumanji: oops I don't have java installed lol
[2015-07-02 12:51:15] Gerard: d'oh!
[2015-07-02 12:51:29] Gerard: You will need that ;)
[2015-07-02 12:51:43] jumanji: alright I 'll give this a shot but man do I wish I could make it work with just chromedriver, favorite that stackoverflow question, hopefully 200 bounty points is enough
