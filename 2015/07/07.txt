[2015-07-07 07:13:56] Dave_B_1: your dropdown list appears to not contain a series of options which makes it a bit odd
[2015-07-07 07:14:45] Suprith: Dave_B_1, it contains around 30 options, I've pasted just one over here
[2015-07-07 07:15:03] Dave_B_1: in that case you could just do driver.find_element_by_css_selector('#edit_field_eco_software_catego_select_und_chosen span').click()
[2015-07-07 07:15:05] Dave_B_1: oh

[2015-07-07 07:51:34] LocusAsaf: I've been told that fixtures should not be used for page navigation and generally be used to just return the set up driver

[2015-07-07 08:04:23] LocusAsaf: Dave_B_1: can you elaborate on the problems a bit more
[2015-07-07 08:04:53] LocusAsaf: I've been following the channels advice on "only return the driver" but I wanted some concrete examples to share that support this philosophy
[2015-07-07 08:04:54] zeljkof, changing nick to zeljkof-meeting.
[2015-07-07 08:05:24] LocusAsaf: why do the problems not get caught/cleaned up properly, what doesn't get cleaned up, what happens if they don't get cleaned up?
[2015-07-07 08:06:10] Dave_B_1: so imagine you log in during your setup step
[2015-07-07 08:06:15] doveyg, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-07 08:06:21] Dave_B_1: now for whatever reason this becomes flakey or fails
[2015-07-07 08:06:23] simonstewart: jimevans: found a bug. Fixing
[2015-07-07 08:06:32] Dave_B_1: as setup has not completed, tearDown won't get run
[2015-07-07 08:06:43] Dave_B_1: so you'll have a browser & driver left running
[2015-07-07 08:06:53] Dave_B_1: and you'll not get a nice error or failure in your test
[2015-07-07 08:07:31] Dave_B_1: depending how your test framework handles unexpected exceptions you could get some odd debugging stuff
[2015-07-07 08:07:45] LocusAsaf: hmmm, I'm not actually sure if the teardown won't be run in my case I'll have to test that
[2015-07-07 08:07:49] doveyg: hi, does selenium use the selected browser engine? does html5/canvas work?
[2015-07-07 08:07:54] LocusAsaf: but I se your point
[2015-07-07 08:07:56] Dave_B_1: fair enough, depends on the framework
[2015-07-07 08:08:01] LocusAsaf: any other things to consider?
[2015-07-07 08:08:15] jimevans: simonstewart: i'd really like to migrate the building of the IE driver and the .NET bindings to buck in the next month or two
[2015-07-07 08:08:23] simonstewart: I would too
[2015-07-07 08:08:42] Dave_B_1: honestly not that much else - i think in general the toher thing is to avoid as much repitition as possible so if you can skip e.g. logging in each time by just setting some auth token or whatever then that can be nice
[2015-07-07 08:08:58] simonstewart: Wondering whether we can bodge something with build-defs for now

[2015-07-07 08:10:14] LocusAsaf: Dave_B_1: doesn't that support logging in with the fixture?
[2015-07-07 08:10:27] jimevans: on my list of stuff to do: update to visual studio 2015 when it releases in a couple of weeks, add a .NET 4.5 compilation target, maybe retire .NET 3.5.
[2015-07-07 08:10:45] simonstewart: What's the usage of .Net 3.5 these days?
[2015-07-07 08:11:36] simonstewart: I can see why this won't work: export PATH=$HOMER/src/selenium/buck/bin:PATH
[2015-07-07 08:11:40] jimevans: not entirely sure. i keep it around because it's the last of the 2.x-level engine.
[2015-07-07 08:13:02] jimevans: but migrations to new .NET versions for some orgs can be as slow as java version updates for enterprises.
[2015-07-07 08:13:50] simonstewart: I can imagine
[2015-07-07 08:17:04] LocusAsaf: jimevans & simonstewart would you be so kind to give your two cents on why it's good practice to only return driver from fixtures?
[2015-07-07 08:17:23] simonstewart: context?
[2015-07-07 08:17:52] LocusAsaf: simonstewart: someone in my team is asking why can't we create a fixture to log in to the dashboard if its happening in many tests
[2015-07-07 08:18:12] LocusAsaf: as opposed to getting a login page, logging in and getting the dashboard page in a test
[2015-07-07 08:18:41] LocusAsaf: I've been told that's a no-no here
[2015-07-07 08:18:42] jimevans: LocusAsaf: i need to understand the term "fixture" in what you're discussing. the term can be somewhat overloaded
[2015-07-07 08:18:49] LocusAsaf: ah okay
[2015-07-07 08:19:07] LocusAsaf: so in PyTest, fixture is essentially used to inject a setup and/or teardown into a test
[2015-07-07 08:19:28] simonstewart: Here's my massively egotistical answer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGu1ud7hk5I
[2015-07-07 08:19:31] WhereIsMySpoon: doveyg: selenium will use whatever browser you tell it to launch
[2015-07-07 08:20:27] LocusAsaf: simonstewart: thanks I'll check that out soon
[2015-07-07 08:20:35] doveyg: WhereIsMySpoon: so it will render html5/canvas elements exactly? - just being extra sure, documentation implies html5 is on the todo list
[2015-07-07 08:20:41] simonstewart: It's the original webdriver talk (which merged into selenium about a year later)
[2015-07-07 08:20:51] LocusAsaf: I'm tending to side with everyone here on this peice of advice I'd just like to give some good concrete examples of why that is a good idea to my team, so I'm looking for specifics
[2015-07-07 08:21:03] WhereIsMySpoon: doveyg: that depends on what browser you launch
[2015-07-07 08:21:16] simonstewart: The idea was to have layers: Selenium -> page objects -> workflows -> something user facing
[2015-07-07 08:21:31] simonstewart: Each layer should talk to the ones below it, but not above it
[2015-07-07 08:21:45] doveyg: WhereIsMySpoon: depends on if the browser itself supports html5/canvas?
[2015-07-07 08:21:58] simonstewart: "something user facing" in that talk was Fitnesse. Nowadays, you'd most likely use cucumber or something
[2015-07-07 08:22:10] WhereIsMySpoon: doveyg: yes
[2015-07-07 08:22:46] doveyg: WhereIsMySpoon: thank you
[2015-07-07 08:24:55] LocusAsaf: jimevans: do you have an opinion now :)

[2015-07-07 08:25:54] Sudhansu1, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-07 08:25:57] jimevans: well, in the specific case of logging in, i believe one should do that via the application UI as seldom as possible. actually do as little as you absolutely have to via the application UI.
[2015-07-07 08:25:58] jimevans: :)
[2015-07-07 08:26:31] LocusAsaf: how can you avoid logging in as the UI, do you create backdoor or shortcut somehow?
[2015-07-07 08:26:44] Selenium-Github: [13selenium] 15shs96c pushed 2 new commits to 06master: 02http://git.io/vq0hU

[2015-07-07 08:27:24] jimevans: LocusAsaf: depends on the app. in many cases, it's a simple matter of obtaining a session from a web API, and setting an appropriate cookie in the browser.
[2015-07-07 08:28:18] jimevans: not a back door per se, but using the actual authentication method of the app without actually going through the UI to do so.
[2015-07-07 08:28:49] LocusAsaf: jimevans: okay cool, good to know.  So you're a fan of testing just what is needed in the test.  For instance, you would have a set of tests that actually log in using the UI but in the rest of the cases you just manually create the cookie to speed things up?
[2015-07-07 08:29:01] jimevans: and be more stable, yes.
[2015-07-07 08:29:10] jimevans: UI automation is not only slow, it's fragile
[2015-07-07 08:29:24] LocusAsaf: So do you support creating said cookie in a setup or not?
[2015-07-07 08:30:06] WhereIsMySpoon: i log in every time i do a new test..
[2015-07-07 08:30:10] WhereIsMySpoon: <_>
[2015-07-07 08:30:21] jimevans: i support having it localized into its own method. calling it from a setup routine or as part of the test itself, i'm actually rather indifferent to.
[2015-07-07 08:31:15] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-07 08:31:31] LocusAsaf: jimevans: so more important is to avoid bad behavior that Dave_B_1 mentioned, don't fail badly and risk breaking tear down and showing bad debug messages

[2015-07-07 08:32:14] LocusAsaf: WhereIsMySpoon: is that a mention to me, you're saying you explicitly have "log in" code in every test vs. in a setup?
[2015-07-07 08:32:57] WhereIsMySpoon: simonstewart: where's chrome on this presentation :p
[2015-07-07 08:33:10] WhereIsMySpoon: LocusAsaf: just generally saying it to the channel
[2015-07-07 08:33:35] simonstewart: Chrome didn't exist
[2015-07-07 08:33:40] simonstewart: That was in 2007
[2015-07-07 08:33:40] WhereIsMySpoon: simonstewart: oh :p
[2015-07-07 08:33:41] LocusAsaf: but relevant to my discussion, did I understand what you said correctly?
[2015-07-07 08:34:09] WhereIsMySpoon: LocusAsaf: yes, in my setUp() i do { driver = setupDriver() }
[2015-07-07 08:34:16] Dave_B_1: same
[2015-07-07 08:34:27] WhereIsMySpoon: and in my test() i do logIn().blah().foo()...
[2015-07-07 08:35:30] WhereIsMySpoon: simonstewart: you seem to like gummy bears
[2015-07-07 08:35:31] WhereIsMySpoon: :Pp
[2015-07-07 08:35:34] WhereIsMySpoon: :P *
[2015-07-07 08:35:42] LocusAsaf: WhereIsMySpoon: so is that just a preference and do you have a good reason why you do it this way?
[2015-07-07 08:35:43] simonstewart: Who doesn't like gummy bears
[2015-07-07 08:35:58] lukeis: i don't like certain brands of gummy bears :)
[2015-07-07 08:36:24] simonstewart: jimevans: do a pull of both selenium master and my fork of buck (http://github.com/shs96c/buck)
[2015-07-07 08:36:29] WhereIsMySpoon: LocusAsaf: it just seemed a lot easier than messing around with cookies
[2015-07-07 08:36:38] LocusAsaf: lukeis: do you like brands of gummy bears that log in the setup or ones that log in the actual tests and why?
[2015-07-07 08:36:41] simonstewart: You'll want to switch the branch of buck to "selenium"
[2015-07-07 08:36:51] lukeis: "Please do something."  â€” hahahhahahaâ€¦ lolâ€¦ ohhâ€¦ ha..haâ€¦ ahhh
[2015-07-07 08:36:58] WhereIsMySpoon: LocusAsaf: he only just got into the channel :p
[2015-07-07 08:37:14] jimevans: lukeis: haribo ftw!
[2015-07-07 08:37:20] lukeis: yes indeed!
[2015-07-07 08:37:23] LocusAsaf: just playing along :)
[2015-07-07 08:37:39] lukeis: too bad my work does not currently stock hariboâ€¦ or is that a good thing for my belly?
[2015-07-07 08:38:00] WhereIsMySpoon: LocusAsaf: i dont see any reason not to have your login code in a fixture..
[2015-07-07 08:38:04] simonstewart: I've just brought my windows laptop to its knees
[2015-07-07 08:38:10] jimevans: simonstewart: i'll get 'round to it. i'm in the middle of a couple of other processes right now.
[2015-07-07 08:38:12] Dave_B_1: my work are very sweet-heavy, including sometimes haribo

[2015-07-07 08:38:27] sircapsalot: as long as they arent the sugar free ones
[2015-07-07 08:38:27] WhereIsMySpoon: my work doesnt stock sweets at all
[2015-07-07 08:38:33] WhereIsMySpoon: people bring some in occasionally..
[2015-07-07 08:38:47] WhereIsMySpoon: then again, we are in total less than 20 people
[2015-07-07 08:38:50] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-07-07 08:39:02] sircapsalot: those ones will destroy your stomach
[2015-07-07 08:39:25] LocusAsaf: I'm intrigued by this cookie thing, does everyone here generally support authenticating with your App in this manner if it's possible?
[2015-07-07 08:40:31] simonstewart: Sugar-free gummy bears cause diarrhea
[2015-07-07 08:40:33] WhereIsMySpoon: simonstewart: you're an amusing speaker :p
[2015-07-07 08:40:37] simonstewart: Thank you
[2015-07-07 08:40:54] jimevans: automation via the UI is slow and fragile. best to be avoided as much as possible.
[2015-07-07 08:40:54] WhereIsMySpoon: its a great presentation too :) unfortunate your rails app exploded
[2015-07-07 08:40:54] simonstewart: That was my first public talk
[2015-07-07 08:41:00] WhereIsMySpoon: simonstewart: for real? wow
[2015-07-07 08:41:13] simonstewart: For real. Bundle of nerves.

[2015-07-07 08:41:29] WhereIsMySpoon: simonstewart: you look a little nervous but nothing crazy

[2015-07-07 08:44:46] jimevans: first, i need some education as to how calling out to external executables happens under buck. then i need to figure out how to code up the stuff to correctly calculate the parameters to pass to those external executables.
[2015-07-07 08:44:49] simonstewart: lukeis: I'd rather pull htmlunit from the tree and let them own it directly :)
[2015-07-07 08:45:08] lukeis: yes, i gathered that beforeâ€¦ who's gonna make that happen? ;)
[2015-07-07 08:45:14] simonstewart: jimevans: If you're in the bowels of Buck, you can just subclass "ShellStep"
[2015-07-07 08:45:28] simonstewart: Or call ShellStep directly
[2015-07-07 08:45:37] LocusAsaf: anyone on the question about about manually setting a cookie to log in?
[2015-07-07 08:45:49] simonstewart: New build rules are registered via KnownBuildRules, which leads you to the Description interface
[2015-07-07 08:45:50] LocusAsaf: it's fine, good, great?
[2015-07-07 08:46:00] LocusAsaf: maybe bad even
[2015-07-07 08:46:05] simonstewart: When implementing a new BuildRule, just subclass AbstractBuildRule for fun and profit
[2015-07-07 08:46:29] simonstewart: And annotate "things that count as inputs" with "@AddsToRuleKey"
[2015-07-07 08:46:55] lukeis: LocusAsaf: we do itâ€¦ although i missed the entire question (caveat you have to navigate to a page on the domain before setting the cookie)
[2015-07-07 08:47:25] jimevans: looks like there are fairly decent docs, so i might give it a go, perhaps over the weekend.
[2015-07-07 08:47:49] LocusAsaf: how do you set a cookie using selenium/webDriver?
[2015-07-07 08:48:03] simonstewart: Feel free to ping me online
[2015-07-07 08:48:08] jimevans: simonstewart: will do.
[2015-07-07 08:48:08] simonstewart: Will walk through everything you need
[2015-07-07 08:48:19] LocusAsaf: is there a link online I can check out?

[2015-07-07 09:02:57] jimevans: well, doing so means ripping out the entire zip library the bindings use and replacing it with something else.
[2015-07-07 09:03:12] jimevans: or forking and fixing the problem in the dependency
[2015-07-07 09:03:32] jimevans: but even there, we run into *sigh* nuget challenges with strong-named assemblies.
[2015-07-07 09:03:56] jimevans: so, yeah, "can" is the appropriate verb. :)

[2015-07-07 09:41:41] LocusAsaf: jimevans: in regards to avoiding the UI when possible, do you support using backend API to create objects to set up tests?
[2015-07-07 09:41:48] sjmikem, quitting. (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[2015-07-07 09:42:02] WhereIsMySpoon: LocusAsaf: "set up objects"?
[2015-07-07 09:42:46] LocusAsaf: WhereIsMySpoon: so for instance suppose that my front end uses a backend that is an API
[2015-07-07 09:43:02] WhereIsMySpoon: LocusAsaf: you mean app-based objects? or selenium ones
[2015-07-07 09:43:02] LocusAsaf: so I could use the UI to create a new user
[2015-07-07 09:43:21] LocusAsaf: or I could interface with my API, create the user and then test stuff with the user in the UI
[2015-07-07 09:43:26] LocusAsaf: app-based
[2015-07-07 09:44:11] WhereIsMySpoon: as a rule i have my selenium tests in a completely separate project from my app code
[2015-07-07 09:44:13] LocusAsaf: like lets say I want to test that I can update a user in my UI. In order to find out if I can update a user the user first has to exist.  So I can create the user with the UI or I can use the API to create the user first
[2015-07-07 09:44:21] WhereIsMySpoon: no
[2015-07-07 09:44:28] WhereIsMySpoon: you do all interactions with the UI like the user would
[2015-07-07 09:45:02] LocusAsaf: jimevans supported avoiding the UI for logging in before, I was curious where he drew the line if he drew one at all
[2015-07-07 09:45:08] WhereIsMySpoon: if the end-user would have to create the user profile then you would do that with the UI
[2015-07-07 09:45:21] WhereIsMySpoon: basically, if its something you want to test, do it the selenium way
[2015-07-07 09:45:36] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: i vehemently disagree.
[2015-07-07 09:45:51] WhereIsMySpoon: if its some setup that you dont want to test and that could potentially break the tests and cause more harm than good, do it the "back-end" way e.g. cookie insertion
[2015-07-07 09:46:13] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: so if the test says "set up a user using hte UI" you'd do it via the app api?
[2015-07-07 09:46:54] jimevans: no, if the test is "edit an existing user", i set up that user using the app API, if available.
[2015-07-07 09:46:56] LocusAsaf: WhereIsMySpoon: no I'm saying the test says "update a user using the UI" so its a question of how to create the user to update it in the first place
[2015-07-07 09:47:14] jimevans: if the test is "create a user", then of course we use the UI for that.
[2015-07-07 09:47:19] LocusAsaf: jimevans: and so you don't draw the line, you use the app API if possible in all cases?
[2015-07-07 09:47:26] jimevans: yes.
[2015-07-07 09:47:34] jimevans: testing via the UI is slow and fragile
[2015-07-07 09:47:39] LocusAsaf: right
[2015-07-07 09:47:46] jimevans: avoid at all costs.
[2015-07-07 09:47:56] jimevans: test as little as possible via the UI
[2015-07-07 09:48:17] jimevans: and I say that as someone who's built a multi-decade career out of UI-based automated testing.
[2015-07-07 09:49:28] jimevans: simonstewart, lukeis: suppose i have a source-code library i want to include in the project. how and where do i include the license information for that source code?

[2015-07-07 14:05:44] brma: my Google Fu is weak today
[2015-07-07 14:06:13] jimevans: brma: i believe the firefox driver (and *only* the firefox driver) adds an attribute to the <html> or the <body> element, but that's my unreliable memory talking.
[2015-07-07 14:06:18] octomeow: is there one?
[2015-07-07 14:06:32] octomeow: I can check for you now
[2015-07-07 14:06:50] jimevans: in other words, not all drivers watermark their presence.
[2015-07-07 14:07:19] brma: @jimevans thanks, I suspected this actually
[2015-07-07 14:07:55] octomeow: ok so

[2015-07-07 14:10:45] brma: @jimevans: If I was trying to detect that a form has been submitted with webdriver using IE.  Can you think of a methodology that I could use?
[2015-07-07 14:10:55] jimevans: brma: nope.
[2015-07-07 14:11:13] jimevans: the driver goes to great lengths to *not* appear as other than a user.
[2015-07-07 14:11:30] brma: @jimevans: not even if I had the ability to inject my own javascript onto the page to do the check?
[2015-07-07 14:11:33] octomeow: if you actually measure the time needed to complete and submit a form, you may get a hint...
[2015-07-07 14:11:56] jimevans: octomeow: that's a rather myopic view, that "IE sucks"
[2015-07-07 14:12:30] octomeow: jimevans, not IE in general (though I don't use it), but the iedriver definitely does

[2015-07-07 14:14:16] jimevans: i mean, i know the IE driver developer can't code his way out of a paper bag...
[2015-07-07 14:15:46] octomeow: I gave up on... let me check...
[2015-07-07 14:19:38] octomeow: oh, I'm sorry. that was safari that refused to clean sessions.
[2015-07-07 14:20:07] octomeow: our website behaves funny with IE driver, and as I had no means to debug the behaviour, I gave up
[2015-07-07 14:21:29] jimevans: i'd suspect the IE driver developer would want to know what the problems were. i know he wants things to be as solid as possible. but as he's fond of saying "i can't fix 'sucks'"
[2015-07-07 14:22:24] octomeow: well, I could discuss it in more detail, for sure, if this somehow help
[2015-07-07 14:22:27] octomeow: helps*
[2015-07-07 14:22:35] jimevans: but, y'know, if all people are interested in is bitching about it, then go right ahead with that.
[2015-07-07 14:23:26] octomeow: do you want me to go in full detail now?
[2015-07-07 14:23:52] jimevans: sure, feel free to discuss it. i don't know how much longer i'm going to be online, but yeah, go ahead.

[2015-07-07 14:29:34] octomeow: First, I have problems with some elements not being clickable. I mean, you click them in webdriver session, but nothing happens.
[2015-07-07 14:30:06] jimevans: what have you tried?
[2015-07-07 14:30:17] octomeow: clicking manually
[2015-07-07 14:30:33] octomeow: after my test failed I've decided to check, and I can find no workaround
[2015-07-07 14:30:48] jimevans: two techniques that are known to improve the situation are turning off native events, and using the requireWindowFocus capability
[2015-07-07 14:31:18] octomeow: caps.SetCapability("requireWindowFocus", true);
[2015-07-07 14:31:31] jimevans: c.f., http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2013/01/revisiting-native-events-in-ie-driver.html
[2015-07-07 14:31:32] octomeow: that was on, but the other one not...
[2015-07-07 14:31:45] jimevans: they're mutually exclusive
[2015-07-07 14:32:04] jimevans: you use one or the other.
[2015-07-07 14:33:06] octomeow: so I either turn window focus ON or native events OFF?
[2015-07-07 14:33:15] jimevans: yes.
[2015-07-07 14:33:26] jimevans: and requireWindowFocus isn't foolproof.
[2015-07-07 14:33:29] octomeow: I can try with native events now...
[2015-07-07 14:33:50] jimevans: there is no. good. way. to simulate keyboard and mouse events in IE
[2015-07-07 14:34:00] jimevans: unless you count javascript simulated events.
[2015-07-07 14:34:11] jimevans: (which is what turning native events off gets you)
[2015-07-07 14:34:53] octomeow: the thing I was confused by is even manual clicks do not work
[2015-07-07 14:35:52] jimevans: that could be related to persistent hovers, but requireWindowFocus should be turning that off automaticaly.

[2015-07-07 14:42:01] jimevans: some caveats though. i'm assuming you're doing webelement.click(), not using the advanced user interactions api (the "actions" class) here.

[2015-07-07 14:43:10] octomeow: I just discovered that double-click works as single-click in that case
[2015-07-07 14:44:01] octomeow: when I click once, I see that crossed circle pointer, but if I click again, I see the menu

[2015-07-07 14:45:29] jimevans: are you doing this interactively, on the same machine? stepping through code in an IDE like eclipse?
[2015-07-07 14:46:07] octomeow: yep
[2015-07-07 14:46:16] jimevans: the behavior you describe sounds a lot like well-known focus issues with native events (though turning those off *should* mitigate that)
[2015-07-07 14:46:45] octomeow: elements use data-bind="click: onCLick"
[2015-07-07 14:46:47] jimevans: i point you to this blog post - http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/06/whats-wrong-with-internet-explorer.html
[2015-07-07 14:46:50] octomeow: knockout bindings
[2015-07-07 14:47:13] jimevans: i don't know what that is.
[2015-07-07 14:48:05] octomeow: lucky you...
[2015-07-07 14:48:30] octomeow: the article you've linked now basically says there's no cure
[2015-07-07 14:48:40] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-07 14:48:44] jimevans: i know. i wrote it.
[2015-07-07 14:49:01] jimevans: as well as all of the code you so eloquently said, "sucks". so thanks for that.
[2015-07-07 14:49:08] octomeow: pfft
[2015-07-07 14:50:27] jimevans: but turning native events off should put you running roughly the same javascript code that runs in firefox to click an element.
[2015-07-07 14:50:44] jimevans: i say roughly because there are a lot of factors that may change that
[2015-07-07 14:50:55] jimevans: like document modes, versions of IE, and so on.
[2015-07-07 14:50:59] octomeow: it was not "sucks" as in "and the person who wrote it sucks too", it was "sucks as being incompatible with my current project", so I was not trying to offend you in any way
[2015-07-07 14:51:28] octomeow: I've tried with both ways, native events and focus, and neither helps
[2015-07-07 14:52:28] octomeow: so I gave up and moved on. Don't really want to create a silly workaround in my code by writing a wrapper for Click() events and checking for IE
[2015-07-07 14:53:12] octomeow: and double-clicking in that case
[2015-07-07 14:53:35] octomeow: that does not even replicate in every element so far, just a few of them
[2015-07-07 14:53:45] jimevans: i get it. but hey, i've only spent about the last five years trying to wrestle IE into something approaching usable, with little support from within microsoft. so y'know, if you have suggestions on how to fix it, i'm all ears.
[2015-07-07 14:54:23] octomeow: that's the problem: I see that it behaves strangely, but I'm frustrated and know next to nothing about all this stuff
[2015-07-07 14:54:49] octomeow: so my only relief is in venting my frustration to the void -_-
[2015-07-07 14:54:53] jimevans: reproducible test pages go a very, very long way toward helping solve these issues

[2015-07-07 15:54:36] jimevans: using that code exactly as i published, in a console app (substituting a valid email and password, of course)?
[2015-07-07 15:54:54] octomeow: sec
[2015-07-07 15:54:54] jimevans: and using no breakpoints.
[2015-07-07 15:54:55] jimevans: :)
[2015-07-07 15:55:16] jimevans: the second you allow visual studio to get in the way, all bets are off.
[2015-07-07 15:56:13] lukeis: this does look like a fun page ;) http://ci.seleniumhq.org:2310/common/cookies.html
[2015-07-07 15:56:36] jimevans: lukeis: oh, yeah. if only our version of jetty would allow httponly cookies...
[2015-07-07 15:57:42] lukeis: Jetty7 doesn't?
[2015-07-07 15:57:57] jimevans: one version of an api doesn't. barancev has the details
[2015-07-07 15:58:19] lukeis:  Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[2015-07-07 16:01:42] octomeow: ok, second issue is my IEDriver uses IE cookies
[2015-07-07 16:02:10] octomeow: so basically I don't always get clean session
[2015-07-07 16:02:55] octomeow: damn it, your code really works.
[2015-07-07 16:03:13] dude-x, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-07-07 16:03:32] jimevans: so if you *really* want a clean session every time you start IE, you can use the ie.ensureCleanSession capability.
[2015-07-07 16:04:26] lukeis: i want the "noReallyReallyGiveMeACleanSession" capability ;)
[2015-07-07 16:04:35] octomeow: lukeis, +1
[2015-07-07 16:04:47] jimevans: in the .NET bindings, if you're using InternetExplorerOptions, you want the EnsureCleanSession property
[2015-07-07 16:05:26] octomeow: DesiredCapabilities caps = DesiredCapabilities.InternetExplorer(); I was using these
[2015-07-07 16:05:48] jimevans: well, usually, deleting the cookies is good enough, which you can do with the cookie API, but that capability will wipe out browsing history and cached files too
[2015-07-07 16:05:55] jimevans: octomeow: don't do that.
[2015-07-07 16:05:56] jimevans: :)
[2015-07-07 16:06:00] octomeow: okay
[2015-07-07 16:06:02] jimevans: i mean, you can.
[2015-07-07 16:06:27] jimevans: but the using the browser-specific options classes are preferred, because they're type safe.
[2015-07-07 16:06:46] octomeow: thanks for the tip!
[2015-07-07 16:07:04] jimevans: and it's easier to avoid misspelling the capability name.
[2015-07-07 16:07:15] jimevans: which the driver will just happily ignore.
[2015-07-07 16:07:15] octomeow: yeah, definitely

[2015-07-07 16:08:50] jimevans: yeah, the .NET equivalent is IntroduceInstability...
[2015-07-07 16:08:57] octomeow: lol
[2015-07-07 16:09:03] jimevans: you'd think the name would be a clue *NOT* to use it.

[2015-07-07 23:55:33] dhsl: Hi everybody. I got a weird issue with Selenium + ChromeDriver + some ajax-heavy website I want to test.
[2015-07-07 23:56:27] dhsl: At one point, I need to fill in a string into a textarea, which then pops up search suggestions in a normally invisible <div>
[2015-07-07 23:57:45] dhsl: I need to fill in "Einzeln". The search box then gives me two clickable <span> elements, one with "Einzeln" and one with "Einzeln/GT" which is perfectly fine. Now I need to click() on the one with only "Einzeln" in it
[2015-07-07 23:58:19] dhsl: Got some XPath here, where I check span[text() = "Einzeln"]. It clicks on "Einzeln/GT" and not "Einzeln"
[2015-07-07 23:59:04] dhsl: I even did something like span[text()[contains(.,"Einzeln") and not(contains(.,"GT"))]] but it still clicks "Einzeln/GT"
