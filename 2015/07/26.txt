[2015-07-26 17:31:37] railswebdev, quitting. (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[2015-07-26 17:35:04] dimacus: raul782: did you forget to export DISPLAY variable?
[2015-07-26 17:35:51] raul782: humm, i'm able to get the html from the url I'm testing
[2015-07-26 17:36:15] dimacus: ahhh ok so it's not getting stuck on getting new brewoser session?
[2015-07-26 17:37:13] raul782: no I believe not
[2015-07-26 17:38:04] dimacus: what part does it get stuck on?
[2015-07-26 17:38:06] raul782: I have to fill an ajax login form to enter into the backend
[2015-07-26 17:38:33] dimacus: i see and what browser are you in?
[2015-07-26 17:38:35] dimacus: firefox?
[2015-07-26 17:38:36] raul782: and I'm filling the username and password, that works fine on my mac
[2015-07-26 17:38:38] raul782: chrome
[2015-07-26 17:39:08] raul782: but I can tell that when I try to go to the backend dashboard page, I get the contents of the login page
[2015-07-26 17:39:13] dimacus: by any chance are you running more than a single instance of a test?
[2015-07-26 17:40:03] raul782: humm, let me check
[2015-07-26 17:40:48] dimacus: right now i'm thinking… what if you have multiple tests running, and 1 window is on top of the other which sometimes causes ajax issues specifically in firefox
[2015-07-26 17:41:31] raul782: nope, these are the commands I'm using :
[2015-07-26 17:41:44] raul782: sudo start xvfb
[2015-07-26 17:41:44] raul782: wget http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-server-standalone-2.35.0.jar --quiet
[2015-07-26 17:41:45] raul782: java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.35.0.jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/usr/local/bin/chromedriver &
[2015-07-26 17:42:13] raul782: on the test side, there is only one runner
[2015-07-26 17:42:22] raul782: I'm using behat with selenium driver
[2015-07-26 17:42:28] raul782: and I'm calling it once
[2015-07-26 17:42:37] dimacus: where is the "export DISPLAY" before java -jar commands?
[2015-07-26 17:43:05] dimacus: raul782: why does your test runner not take care of teh stand alone jar itself? what language are your tests written in?
[2015-07-26 17:45:15] raul782: I'm testing php
[2015-07-26 17:45:24] raul782: using gherkin language
[2015-07-26 17:45:48] raul782: ok I will run one more time with export DISPLAY=:0.0
[2015-07-26 17:46:06] dimacus: raul782: don't use 0.0 that is reserved for a physical display
[2015-07-26 17:46:17] raul782: but I believe this variable is already set
[2015-07-26 17:46:18] dimacus: when starting xvfb start in on :1 +
[2015-07-26 17:46:53] raul782: export DISPLAY=:1+ or with space between 1 and +?
[2015-07-26 17:47:11] dimacus: errr + as in 1 or more
[2015-07-26 17:47:26] dimacus: also are you using php-webdriver or php-webdriver-bindingds?
[2015-07-26 17:48:34] raul782: instaclick/php-webdriver
[2015-07-26 17:49:28] dimacus: raul782: i feel like your use of java-jar command is a duplicate… when you start a test (in ruby ruby foo_test.rb etc…) typically the language biding does the "java -jar" command within itself
[2015-07-26 17:50:11] raul782: I tried that but it gave me an error initially
[2015-07-26 17:50:28] raul782: an error like the selenium server wasn't available
[2015-07-26 17:50:47] raul782: when I check the debug info from selenium, I see that between pages, the session is kept
[2015-07-26 17:51:24] dimacus: hmm that's super odd
[2015-07-26 17:51:58] *dimacus wishes he had more experience with php driver'
[2015-07-26 17:53:11] dimacus: raul782: another question… when the test is running… what is the command that fails? is it a click or get?
[2015-07-26 17:53:23] dimacus: type you said… is there any error in the log what is so ever?
[2015-07-26 17:54:40] raul782: nope, just that I don't get passed to the dashboard page, what I'm doing is adding the export display, that is probably the problem maybe
[2015-07-26 17:55:37] dimacus: any cahnce you can connect to the box while the test is running and actually watch what happens?
[2015-07-26 17:55:47] dimacus: or at least take a screenshot at the point of failure?
[2015-07-26 17:56:11] raul782: that's the issue I'm trying to figure it out, I'm using drone.io

[2015-07-26 17:56:44] raul782: So I can't access the box inside it
[2015-07-26 17:57:01] raul782: I can store the screenshot, but not sure how can I export that
[2015-07-26 17:57:20] raul782: I might need S3 to do that
[2015-07-26 17:57:23] dimacus: so the screnshot should be saved on the test runner
[2015-07-26 17:57:31] dimacus: it's actually a bas64 string
[2015-07-26 17:57:53] dimacus: if you can get it off the remote machine, even if you just print it into test console output
[2015-07-26 17:58:00] raul782: really, so I could actually dump that into the console ?
[2015-07-26 17:58:03] dimacus: and convert it to image
[2015-07-26 17:58:16] raul782: aha
[2015-07-26 17:59:18] dimacus: sorry not familiar enough with php driver, but in ruby and java driver you can save the screenshot to file
[2015-07-26 17:59:30] dimacus: or just get the base64 string of a screenshot
[2015-07-26 17:59:48] raul782: yeah, I can do that dump the screenshot content
[2015-07-26 18:00:05] dimacus: i feel like there might be something on the page that is browser seeing that you don't see on your local box
[2015-07-26 18:00:48] dimacus: since it is not an issue with getting a browser session, and you are able to use .get() to navigate to the page you want
[2015-07-26 18:01:23] dimacus: but the issue is on the fillout page… you should do a screenshot when you land on the page, when you fill out first field, 2nd field, pre-submit, post submit
[2015-07-26 18:01:49] dimacus: after you did all of that… see if all pages look as expected… maybe you are getting som error somewhere… like "user not found"

[2015-07-26 18:05:24] raul782: humm now that I put export DISPLAY=:99.0, I got an exception
[2015-07-26 18:05:31] dimacus: what's the exception?
[2015-07-26 18:06:05] raul782: Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: unknown error: Chrome failed to start: exited abnormally
[2015-07-26 18:06:30] dimacus: well before you do the "export DISPLAY" did you start xvfb on :99?
[2015-07-26 18:06:39] raul782: I'm running a demo project so you can see the issue

[2015-07-26 18:07:16] raul782: sudo start xvfb
[2015-07-26 18:07:24] raul782: that's the order I followed

[2015-07-26 18:10:41] raul782: Ic
[2015-07-26 18:11:55] dimacus: the first link you sent, the /144 one is deff issue where the browser does not know which display to open in or display is not available
[2015-07-26 18:12:47] dimacus: also… the .0 in :99.0 is odd i don't think you need the .0
[2015-07-26 18:12:53] dimacus: (never used it)
[2015-07-26 18:14:13] raul782: ok I will try that
[2015-07-26 18:14:47] dimacus: alright it's 9pm here i'm off to put my kids down to sleep… good night, wish you luck and try again tomorrow when everyone is awake ;)
