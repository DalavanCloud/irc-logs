[2015-07-23 02:46:56] WhereIsMySpoon: arbuz: the nodes subscribe to the hub and accept selenium commands from it, they arent directly controlled by it

[2015-07-23 04:31:28] elmcrest: WhereIsMySpoon: sry for the Delay, was having lunch. f.e. like this self.send_keys("Task Group 1" + Keys.TAB)
[2015-07-23 04:31:45] elmcrest: other keys work well - and Tab is the natural way a User would use it too
[2015-07-23 04:32:01] rplevka: elmcrest: python?
[2015-07-23 04:32:07] elmcrest: rplevka: yes
[2015-07-23 04:32:45] rplevka: elmcrest: don't know, but try to put 'u' (declare unicode) in front of your string .. u"Task Group..."
[2015-07-23 04:33:22] elmcrest: rplevka: it's python3 so this isn't needed anymore
[2015-07-23 04:33:27] rplevka: oh
[2015-07-23 04:33:48] elmcrest: actually the String get placed into the Field
[2015-07-23 04:33:56] elmcrest: only the Tab key somehow doesn't get sned
[2015-07-23 04:34:00] elmcrest: s/sned/send
[2015-07-23 04:34:03] rplevka: gotcha
[2015-07-23 04:34:08] elmcrest: a following Shift+Enter f.e. works again
[2015-07-23 04:35:04] rplevka: elmcrest: are you trying to move the focus to the next element after inserting the text into the field?
[2015-07-23 04:35:11] elmcrest: rplevka: exactly
[2015-07-23 04:36:47] rplevka: elmcrest: this is just my guess... i believe .send_keys() works on the element ...so you're pretty much sending the tabulator as a value() for the text field
[2015-07-23 04:39:17] elmcrest: hehe ok if I send the tab only it crashes :)
[2015-07-23 04:39:38] rplevka: elmcrest: there you go :) that's what i call a progress

[2015-07-23 04:42:45] rplevka: elmcrest: checking some sample code out on stackoverflow, it looks like sending Keys.TAB to the text field was correct
[2015-07-23 04:43:10] rplevka: how about trying to send the text first, then send_keys(Keys.TAB) again?
[2015-07-23 04:43:24] elmcrest: that's what I'm doing at the moment without success
[2015-07-23 04:43:31] elmcrest: I even added some sleep time 0.5 secs
[2015-07-23 04:44:12] elmcrest: (timing did help me before on another Issue :D )
[2015-07-23 04:44:48] rplevka: how about sending "\t" ? (desperate idea)
[2015-07-23 04:45:31] elmcrest: tried that, too
[2015-07-23 04:45:36] elmcrest: no success sadly

[2015-07-23 04:45:55] sgsabbage: elmcrest: When you say it crashes, is there an error or?
[2015-07-23 04:45:56] elmcrest: it try some other keys now ... Shift+Enter works
[2015-07-23 04:46:15] elmcrest: sgsabbage: doesn't crash anymore. but was about an missing Node
[2015-07-23 04:47:56] sgsabbage: hmm, ok - if it does crash again just sending the tab, gist the stacktrace if you can
[2015-07-23 04:48:38] elmcrest: ok I try to reproduce it
[2015-07-23 04:49:40] sgsabbage: just want to check, you're calling send_keys on a web element, right
[2015-07-23 04:49:40] sgsabbage: ?
[2015-07-23 04:50:34] elmcrest: sgsabbage: send_keys is actually this: self.driver.switch_to.active_element.send_keys(keys)
[2015-07-23 04:50:52] elmcrest: but yeah
[2015-07-23 04:51:06] elmcrest: but, it's not an input, it's and contenteditable=True element
[2015-07-23 04:51:19] elmcrest: but works fine
[2015-07-23 04:51:31] elmcrest: at least when using it manually
[2015-07-23 04:52:03] sgsabbage: kk
[2015-07-23 04:52:19] elmcrest: btw I can't reproduce the crash... probably I did something different wrong
[2015-07-23 04:52:32] elmcrest: ha! now that I said this ...
[2015-07-23 04:53:36] elmcrest: TypeError: Failed to execute 'createNSResolver' on 'Document': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'.

[2015-07-23 05:35:02] EdwardIII: sgsabbage: hrm i figured i'd create a real FF profile on the host machine, then cp it to the guest machine
[2015-07-23 05:35:11] EdwardIII: i must say this has proved to be more complex than i initially counted on
[2015-07-23 05:35:18] EdwardIII: as is often the case with PHP
[2015-07-23 05:35:29] EdwardIII: currently battling with this: Error: Method GuzzleHttp\Query::__toString() must not throw an exception
[2015-07-23 05:35:32] EdwardIII: like wtf.... why?
[2015-07-23 05:35:39] EdwardIII: it masks whatever the underlying exception is and has no stack trace
[2015-07-23 05:35:46] EdwardIII: so you're just...screwed
[2015-07-23 05:35:59] EdwardIII: it's about as useful as "Segfault"

[2015-07-23 07:27:44] simonstewart: Because myself and kronsenvold abused it quite a lot
[2015-07-23 07:27:59] WhereIsMySpoon: hm..im sure i remember something about the port binding having issues
[2015-07-23 07:28:53] simonstewart: It times out after a while
[2015-07-23 07:28:58] simonstewart: So you can definitely have issues
[2015-07-23 07:29:13] simonstewart: And there's a lot of magic about not running out of ephemeral ports
[2015-07-23 07:32:03] mikolaj: ehh so how can i run 100 and more  parallel tests with selenium ?
[2015-07-23 07:33:26] simonstewart: Many different ways
[2015-07-23 07:33:38] simonstewart: The best is by not running the 100 tests on the same machine
[2015-07-23 07:34:02] simonstewart: But you can also control the port assignment mechanism, and avoid the approach that's baked in entirely
[2015-07-23 07:34:21] simonstewart: (which solves the cross-jvm, cross-language, multitple tests on a single machine problem as cleanly as possible)
[2015-07-23 07:36:04] beaconwriter: I found a typo in the java docs. Can someone walk me through my first git hub pull request?
[2015-07-23 07:36:23] simonstewart: fork the project on GH, make your changes, and check them in
[2015-07-23 07:36:38] simonstewart: (Personally, I like a separate branch for each logical feature)
[2015-07-23 07:36:50] mikolaj: "But you can also control the port assignment mechanism, and avoid the approach that's baked in entirely" How ? :D
[2015-07-23 07:37:33] simonstewart: I'd need to read the code, but I remember it not being hard
[2015-07-23 07:37:38] simonstewart: Because I needed to do it :)
[2015-07-23 07:38:25] mikolaj: So can i send you my code ? Or you must look in yours code  ?:)
[2015-07-23 07:38:47] simonstewart: I'm just reading the selenium source

[2015-07-23 07:53:38] simonstewart: I don't think you're going to have a great time of that
[2015-07-23 07:54:15] D3M0S: don't think theres enough threads on a single machine to really handle that
[2015-07-23 07:54:32] mikolaj: i start hub on my local machine
[2015-07-23 07:54:38] simonstewart: Depends on your OS, but 100 threads isn't actually that bad
[2015-07-23 07:54:45] mikolaj: but nodes are running on different machines
[2015-07-23 07:54:56] mikolaj: and on my local machines i just start mvn tets

[2015-07-23 07:56:55] mikolaj: I was tried by phantomjs by xvfb

[2015-07-23 07:58:42] D3M0S: mikolaj, I feel from looking at your code that you're not going to have problems with the selenium side of things
[2015-07-23 07:58:50] mikolaj: so next i tried with xvfb
[2015-07-23 07:58:59] D3M0S: you're going to need to look into parallization either through testng, or junit and the maven-surefire-plugin
[2015-07-23 07:59:28] EdwardIII: BHS_error: well my statement was a joke intended to poke fun at my own kind

[2015-07-23 08:00:23] mikolaj: writed in angular
[2015-07-23 08:00:42] D3M0S: then I'd probably try to use phantomjs
[2015-07-23 08:00:49] WhereIsMySpoon: D3M0S: that doesnt work
[2015-07-23 08:00:53] WhereIsMySpoon: D3M0S: he has https issues
[2015-07-23 08:00:59] WhereIsMySpoon: they are recorded bugs in phantomjs

[2015-07-23 08:01:30] D3M0S: mikolaj, what are your resources like?
[2015-07-23 08:01:40] D3M0S: how many nodes and what are the specs of each node
[2015-07-23 08:01:46] EdwardIII: BHS_error: i mean a debugging client really
[2015-07-23 08:01:50] EdwardIII: BHS_error: but i'm just using the standard php runtime
[2015-07-23 08:01:55] D3M0S: what are the nodes running on, etc
[2015-07-23 08:02:17] BHS_error: EdwardIII: IIRC you have things like remote debugging right ?
[2015-07-23 08:02:21] EdwardIII: BHS_error: yeah
[2015-07-23 08:02:30] mikolaj: i have problem with 10 nodes... for 5 test +5 nodes all works fine but for 6 and upper i have this error
[2015-07-23 08:02:31] EdwardIII: well you only have remote debugging iirc

[2015-07-23 08:03:05] D3M0S: I mean, I worked for a pretty big organization that had loads of selenium tests, and we had the ability to hit 50 simultanious instances as a shared grid for the entire org.
[2015-07-23 08:03:20] D3M0S: I don't see why you'd need 100 simultanious unless you're load testing
[2015-07-23 08:03:40] BHS_error: like xdebug_start(); xdebug_stop() around the code you want to trace ?
[2015-07-23 08:03:41] D3M0S: no suite would parallize over 5 threads though
[2015-07-23 08:03:47] WhereIsMySpoon: and 100 simultaineous isnt really a big load :p
[2015-07-23 08:03:49] D3M0S: well, we had a few that were authorized 10 threads
[2015-07-23 08:04:31] BHS_error: but yeah it's not step by step execution, you just have the trace
[2015-07-23 08:04:32] mikolaj: yes i am load testing
[2015-07-23 08:04:51] mikolaj: i start with 50 threads and i must end with 600
[2015-07-23 08:04:53] D3M0S: so your purpose is mainly load testing?
[2015-07-23 08:04:59] mikolaj: 3 user stories with test scenarios
[2015-07-23 08:05:32] mikolaj: yes
[2015-07-23 08:05:32] D3M0S: why not use a tool that's better at load testing like Jmeter?
[2015-07-23 08:05:48] D3M0S: and test the functionality separatly with selenium?
[2015-07-23 08:06:03] mikolaj: I never used this before and i totally dont know how it woirks
[2015-07-23 08:06:17] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium is more suited for functional testing
[2015-07-23 08:06:29] D3M0S: selenium makes for some really expensive load tests
[2015-07-23 08:06:33] WhereIsMySpoon: ^
[2015-07-23 08:06:57] WhereIsMySpoon: 600 selenium threads...

[2015-07-23 08:07:02] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-07-23 08:07:07] mikolaj: So do you think i should use jmeter totally ?
[2015-07-23 08:07:22] mikolaj: and by this tool i can run tests parallel ?
[2015-07-23 08:07:39] WhereIsMySpoon: i think you should do some googling on load testing applications
[2015-07-23 08:08:06] mikolaj: i do and poeple write about grid

[2015-07-23 09:28:57] WhereIsMySpoon: 4000
[2015-07-23 09:29:23] WhereIsMySpoon: test est 40000
[2015-07-23 09:29:26] lukeis: if you type up to 4 or 5  hex characters in a row and it happens to match a commit in the history, yes, it will report it back
[2015-07-23 09:29:39] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: earlier when i typed "40000" it was just spitting out a commit
[2015-07-23 09:29:50] *lukeis looking in the log'

[2015-07-23 09:30:27] WhereIsMySpoon: oh thats it
[2015-07-23 09:30:29] lukeis: you matched a commit ;)
[2015-07-23 09:30:41] WhereIsMySpoon: yea but it was a little annoying to have it constantly pop that up :P
[2015-07-23 09:31:01] WhereIsMySpoon: and it might be misleading if someone types a number and the bot pops up a commit, might think it has something to do with it
[2015-07-23 09:31:02] lukeis: stop saying 45000 then! :-D
[2015-07-23 09:31:04] WhereIsMySpoon: i dunno

[2015-07-23 09:33:38] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: i just meant like that you'd have to say #4 5000 to get it to show rather than just plain 4 5000 (without the spaces)

[2015-07-23 12:21:32] lukeis: heh
[2015-07-23 12:21:41] errant_rider: i have committed to the coreâ€¦but its been a LONG time
[2015-07-23 12:21:43] jimevans: errant_rider: we're around. i don't have any specific plans. patty works until 8 mon-thurs.
[2015-07-23 12:21:50] errant_rider: perfect.  Late dinner?
[2015-07-23 12:22:09] jimevans: sure.
[2015-07-23 12:22:30] errant_rider: wednesday is probably best day for us I thinkâ€¦
[2015-07-23 12:22:30] jimevans: let me ping her about which day.
[2015-07-23 12:22:31] sircapsalot: tourdedave well i'm in the selenium-commiters group in github, does that count :D
[2015-07-23 12:22:32] errant_rider: ok
[2015-07-23 12:22:51] jimevans: and we'll have to play it by ear a little with her. we never know how much energy she's gonna have from day to day.
[2015-07-23 12:23:27] tourdedave: Perhaps. It's up to the planning committee. I can bring it up on our next planning call
[2015-07-23 12:23:42] sircapsalot: i'm @ddavison in github

[2015-07-23 12:26:26] lukeis: i believe "all day"
[2015-07-23 12:26:29] lukeis: :-D
[2015-07-23 12:26:34] dimacus: in india mine was supposed to be 5 horusâ€¦ i ran out of stuff by 3.5 hours :(
[2015-07-23 12:27:33] lukeis: yeah, i think we're going to be the sameâ€¦. denali had a grand notion she told me that she wanted everyone to set up (free) AWS accounts and teach them how to spin up a grid there too
[2015-07-23 12:27:41] lukeis: i wasn't a big fan of that idea
[2015-07-23 12:28:03] lukeis: dimacus: do you have your content from the last grid workshop?

[2015-07-23 12:29:24] lukeis: :)
[2015-07-23 12:29:30] dimacus: instead i got pros who grilled me on every config
[2015-07-23 12:29:33] dimacus: and JVM option
[2015-07-23 12:29:40] lukeis: there may be a range of knowledge at thisâ€¦ from 0 - pro

[2015-07-23 12:36:54] tourdedave: @SeleniumHQ has been dormant for a couple of years. A worthy retweet to bring it back into swing.
[2015-07-23 12:36:55] sgsabbage, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-23 12:37:09] jimevans: and yes, i've had a blog post queued up about it for about a week now.
[2015-07-23 12:37:41] tourdedave: Could be a good topic for a future Selenium Hangout.
[2015-07-23 12:38:02] tourdedave: AutomatedTester and I are overdue for one
[2015-07-23 12:38:06] AutomatedTester: we are indeed
[2015-07-23 12:38:33] lukeis: EdgeDriver is already in the source tree ;)
[2015-07-23 12:38:45] jimevans: yep. pull request merged yesterday. :)
[2015-07-23 12:38:54] *AutomatedTester might be crying a little right now...'
[2015-07-23 12:38:56] jimevans: i can talk about it now!!!
[2015-07-23 12:39:03] lukeis: which suggests they *can* look at the selenium code base now??
[2015-07-23 12:39:11] jimevans: i've been under an embargo for more than a week
[2015-07-23 12:39:20] AutomatedTester: lukeis: it might be that 1 person can look at the source
[2015-07-23 12:39:26] jimevans: well, some of them can. :)
[2015-07-23 12:39:37] jimevans: and read carefully the microsoft blog post.
[2015-07-23 12:39:51] lukeis: oh, i didn't intend on reading it ;)
[2015-07-23 12:40:01] jimevans: they've implemented the existing OSS json wire protocol, in addition to the w3c dialect
[2015-07-23 12:40:15] lukeis: how kind of them :)
[2015-07-23 12:40:39] sgsabbage: :log
[2015-07-23 12:40:59] jimevans: ah. here's what they've implemented and what they haven't yet http://dev.modern.ie/platform/status/webdriver/details/
[2015-07-23 12:41:22] D3M0S: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/01399fffecd5a20af6f31aed6cb0043c9c5cde65/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/service/DriverService.java
[2015-07-23 12:41:27] jimevans: so element.findElement doesn't work. finding by xpath doesn't work. switching frames isn't implemented.

[2015-07-23 12:42:16] AutomatedTester: now they iterate
[2015-07-23 12:42:23] AutomatedTester: this. is. awesome!!!!!!!!!
[2015-07-23 12:42:30] lukeis: no alert text? that'll be interesting to work with in java then ;)
[2015-07-23 12:42:46] D3M0S: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/01399fffecd5a20af6f31aed6cb0043c9c5cde65/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/chrome/ChromeDriverService.java
[2015-07-23 12:43:03] jimevans: AutomatedTester: oh, yeah totally agree!
[2015-07-23 12:43:12] jimevans: just setting expectations.
[2015-07-23 12:43:18] D3M0S: So, ChromeDriverService has a Builder that extends DriverService.Builder
[2015-07-23 12:43:26] D3M0S: where is DriverService.Builder in DriverService?
[2015-07-23 12:43:58] lukeis: D3M0S: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/service/DriverService.java#L201
[2015-07-23 12:44:27] D3M0S: yeah it's there
[2015-07-23 12:44:30] D3M0S: whhhaaatt
[2015-07-23 12:46:19] lukeis: soâ€¦ oddly enough on that modern.ie page, the element/text  endpoint links to the alert text spec?
[2015-07-23 12:46:33] lukeis: so, maybe their doc just isn't accurate :)
[2015-07-23 12:46:57] lukeis: jimevans: have you run the selenium suite against it yet? :)
[2015-07-23 12:47:29] jimevans: yeah, a couple of days ago. or at least the .NET version of it. the results were abysmal.
[2015-07-23 12:47:35] lukeis: heh
[2015-07-23 12:47:46] jimevans: we do a *lot* of find by xpath.
[2015-07-23 12:47:57] AutomatedTester: they are implementing xpath in edge
[2015-07-23 12:47:58] lukeis: ahh
[2015-07-23 12:48:04] jimevans: yes, they are.
[2015-07-23 12:48:08] AutomatedTester: or so says status.modern.ie
[2015-07-23 12:48:11] jimevans: they'll get there.
[2015-07-23 12:48:31] AutomatedTester: I literally don't care how good or bad it is
[2015-07-23 12:48:39] jimevans: at this point i don't either
[2015-07-23 12:48:44] AutomatedTester: THEY. SHIPPED. AN. IMPLEMENTATION
[2015-07-23 12:48:51] *AutomatedTester head asplode'
[2015-07-23 12:48:52] lukeis: :)
[2015-07-23 12:49:01] D3M0S: why is my DriverService file only 196 lines long!!! I don't understand at all!!!
[2015-07-23 12:49:11] jimevans: man, i've been waiting to talk about this for *days*
[2015-07-23 12:49:22] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-23 12:49:47] lukeis: D3M0S: you seeâ€¦ there's a thing called gitâ€¦ where you can make changes incrementally and then push to another repoâ€¦
[2015-07-23 12:50:10] D3M0S: lol
[2015-07-23 12:50:29] D3M0S: lukeis, it's in a project just tying to use new ChromeDriver()
[2015-07-23 12:50:34] sgsabbage: jimevans: That's awesome! :)
[2015-07-23 12:50:43] D3M0S: it's pulling down 2.46.0 from maven
[2015-07-23 12:50:58] D3M0S: i did a clean install, and the file doesn't match the repo, I just dont even
[2015-07-23 12:51:06] D3M0S: maybe I've been staring at the computer for too long today
[2015-07-23 12:52:02] sircapsalot, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-23 12:53:15] D3M0S: the only thing that I really did was try to use this phantomjs-maven-plugin which is supposed to give me the phantomjs binaries in the project, I commented all that stuff out and did a clean install to see if that was affecting the files some how
[2015-07-23 12:53:32] someone235, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-23 12:55:13] D3M0S: oh
[2015-07-23 12:56:01] D3M0S: really, is com.github.detro.phantomjsdriver overwriting the DriverService files?
[2015-07-23 12:56:07] D3M0S: I commented that out and it's fixed

[2015-07-23 13:03:20] lukeis: D3M0S: ghostdriver depends on 2.39 of selenium, in maven you'd have to likely exclude the selenium dependencies explicitly from it, otherwise you are trying to include 2.39 and 2.46â€¦ and the jvm will 'pick' one run-time to use
[2015-07-23 13:03:38] D3M0S: ah that makes sense
[2015-07-23 13:04:10] D3M0S: I'm just not going to integrate with phantomjs, I'd rather be on latest selenium version.
[2015-07-23 13:05:08] D3M0S: oh do you think I can get away with just an exclusion?
[2015-07-23 13:05:14] D3M0S: I'll try it
[2015-07-23 13:06:07] lukeis: yes, you should be able to just exclude selenium from the phantomjs dependencyâ€¦ namely selenium-server, selenium-java and selenium-remote-driver
[2015-07-23 13:06:47] lukeis: you should add dependency convergence check to your pom :)
[2015-07-23 13:07:45] lukeis: alsoâ€¦ someone should update the ghostdriver project :)

[2015-07-23 13:37:58] D3M0S: So I went to a talk a few months ago
[2015-07-23 13:38:04] D3M0S: for a local java users group
[2015-07-23 13:38:10] D3M0S: I guy showed some metrics on browsers
[2015-07-23 13:38:17] D3M0S: he said that phantomjs was slower than chrome
[2015-07-23 13:38:20] D3M0S: it's not
[2015-07-23 13:39:08] AutomatedTester: D3M0S: as with all metrics the base test can make a difference
[2015-07-23 13:39:28] D3M0S: I ran an array of 12 tests, they're all the same, both single threaded and multithreaded with phantomjs and chrome
[2015-07-23 13:39:51] D3M0S: single threaded phantomjs 1min 3 sec, single threaded chrome 1min 24 sec
[2015-07-23 13:40:12] D3M0S: multithreaded phantomjs 26sec, multithreaded crhome 48sec
[2015-07-23 13:40:41] AutomatedTester: have phantomjs been upgraded to have a decent JS engine yet?
[2015-07-23 13:41:12] D3M0S: almost twice as fast than chrome while multithreaded, I think the speed comes in during the driver instantiation and browser setup
[2015-07-23 13:41:28] D3M0S: chrome takes a long time to pull up the browser compared to phantomjs
