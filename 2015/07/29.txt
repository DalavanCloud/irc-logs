[2015-07-29 06:11:22] mt_: is anyone here who know somethings abou problem with selenium grid + phantomjs ? I cannot open one page which starts https
[2015-07-29 06:11:56] mt_: when i get driver.getTitle() i have empty string for this site
[2015-07-29 06:12:04] mt_: for google etc all works fine
[2015-07-29 06:12:19] Rollup, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-29 06:12:22] mt_: but this one page does not open (?)
[2015-07-29 06:14:04] mt_: but when i use phantomjs in junit for this page
[2015-07-29 06:14:07] mt_: all works fine
[2015-07-29 06:17:41] Dave_B_1: when on the grid is your node on the same machine as when using junit?
[2015-07-29 06:18:09] mt_: when i take screenshot after driver.get(address) then i have nothing :D transparent screen
[2015-07-29 06:18:20] mt_: yes
[2015-07-29 06:18:32] mt_: i have nodes and hub on my machine
[2015-07-29 06:18:56] Dave_B_1: weird :( sorry I don't know about that problem
[2015-07-29 06:19:09] mt_: totally weird :D
[2015-07-29 06:19:37] mt_: driver = new PhantomJSDriver(DesireCaps);
[2015-07-29 06:19:40] mt_: this works fine

[2015-07-29 06:19:55] mt_: this not
[2015-07-29 06:20:45] Dave_B_1: how about driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://localhost:4444/wd/hub"),DesireCaps);
[2015-07-29 06:21:04] Dave_B_1: in general i avoid phantomjs as it's got lots of odd bugs :( and not testing how a user would use the site but I realise this isn't a helpful answer :/
[2015-07-29 06:21:24] Dave_B_1: given your two examples appear to have some differences to threading too
[2015-07-29 06:21:30] mt_: i testes this solution too but not working
[2015-07-29 06:21:41] Dave_B_1: ok so not related to the threading :(

[2015-07-29 07:01:33] jimevans: oh how cute. someone just opened a spec bug that window handles should be ordered.
[2015-07-29 07:01:43] jimevans: that would be ato. :)
[2015-07-29 07:02:10] AutomatedTester: no... he didnt raise it
[2015-07-29 07:02:10] ato: I didn't open it, just moved it from the GH issue tracker.
[2015-07-29 07:02:15] jimevans: ah.
[2015-07-29 07:02:15] AutomatedTester: he said we should close it
[2015-07-29 07:02:17] jimevans: i see.
[2015-07-29 07:02:18] ato: For visibility.
[2015-07-29 07:03:04] ato: Is backwards compatibility the reason we landed on not ordering window handles?  Between e.g. IEDriver and Edge?
[2015-07-29 07:03:46] jimevans: i've no idea how edge driver does things.
[2015-07-29 07:04:07] ato: I mentioned Edge because there we can obviously mandate what how it does things.

[2015-07-29 07:07:25] jimevans: IE uses a map in the c++ stl, the keys of which are unordered. i could refactor the IE driver to enforce an order, i suppose. it'd be additional crufty code that would server only a marginal (imo) purpose.

[2015-07-29 07:45:50] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: prevents polluting the system packages
[2015-07-29 07:45:56] simonstewart: So, virtualenv for testing, rather than manipulating the PYTHONPATH?
[2015-07-29 07:46:27] AutomatedTester: how would you manipulate the pythonpath?
[2015-07-29 07:47:03] simonstewart: I control the build tool. I can do _anything_ :)
[2015-07-29 07:47:36] AutomatedTester: I mean, how would you manupulate the python path in a way that allows it to be blown away if need be
[2015-07-29 07:47:45] AutomatedTester: and all the site packages
[2015-07-29 07:48:04] simonstewart: There's the env variable
[2015-07-29 07:48:09] simonstewart: $PYTHONPATH
[2015-07-29 07:49:13] AutomatedTester: no, I wouldnt want to use that (from reading python docs)
[2015-07-29 07:49:20] AutomatedTester: and would want virtualenv
[2015-07-29 07:49:42] CTtpollard: venv is very useful with python imo
[2015-07-29 07:49:43] AutomatedTester: oh...
[2015-07-29 07:50:13] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: you could do it with python path but my preference would be to use virtualenv
[2015-07-29 07:51:28] simonstewart: Duly noted.
[2015-07-29 07:51:52] dude-x: you would rather use a virtualenv because it isolates the system and main python from test runs.
[2015-07-29 07:52:00] AutomatedTester: dude-x: yea
[2015-07-29 07:52:09] dude-x: I would also add a hash -r command to clear any cached libraries
[2015-07-29 07:52:18] shawnknight, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-29 07:52:45] AutomatedTester: dude-x: using a virtualenv means that you can switch python versions if need be
[2015-07-29 07:53:38] dude-x: AutomatedTester: on a long running terminal window where you switch virtual environments every now and then, you would start getting import errors in python
[2015-07-29 07:53:55] dude-x: so a hash reset would make sure that references to files are recalculated

[2015-07-29 10:16:38] jimevans: someone should try it. :)
[2015-07-29 10:16:40] dimacus: is edge as picky as IE in general?
[2015-07-29 10:16:50] jimevans: how do you mean "picky"?
[2015-07-29 10:16:50] dimacus: say multiple profiles or 1 per user?
[2015-07-29 10:17:02] jimevans: no, that's still single profile
[2015-07-29 10:17:06] dimacus: or needs to be in focus or it does not render JS in same way
[2015-07-29 10:17:19] dimacus: ok edge has the same weight as IE in that case

[2015-07-29 10:17:24] jimevans: i don't know the answers to those.
[2015-07-29 10:17:36] jimevans: i didn't write the edge driver, so all i can do is speculate
[2015-07-29 10:17:54] dimacus: fair enough but if in fact edge is only single profile
[2015-07-29 10:18:05] dimacus: that means that 1 node can safely only run 1 test
[2015-07-29 10:18:15] dimacus: therefore node running 1 edge/ie test is 100% busy

[2015-07-29 10:20:36] dimacus: i wonder why MS didn't implement profiles in Edgeâ€¦ my original thought was it was a complete re-write of the browser, so implementing profiles sounds like a no brainer
[2015-07-29 10:21:06] dude-x: maybe because they tie profiles to user accounts
[2015-07-29 10:21:28] dimacus: user accounts on system or in teh cloud?

[2015-07-29 15:24:15] octomeow: I mean, what the hell? Selenium scrolls to element and clicks on it. The problem is, at that point element is located at the top of the screen and is hidden by semi-transparent topbar.

[2015-07-29 15:30:54] jimevans: octomeow: the scroll behavior is entirely consistent with the javascript element.scrollIntoView() function.

[2015-07-29 15:33:09] octomeow: jimevans, that much I figured. I am trying to think now of a way to go around this, cause even if I click, scroll up and click again, second click scrolls it back again.
[2015-07-29 15:34:24] octomeow: and I'm curious as to why did it happen only recently. I thought our design wasn't changed as much.

[2015-07-29 15:35:25] jimevans: depending on the browser you're having trouble with, you can alter the scroll behavior to scroll to the bottom of the viewport instead.
[2015-07-29 15:36:15] jimevans: IE and firefox implement the elementScrollBehavior capability

[2015-07-29 15:37:21] octomeow: m
[2015-07-29 15:37:22] AutomatedTester: can I ship yet?
[2015-07-29 15:37:24] jimevans: set to 1, it behaves as if scrollIntoView(true) were called, which scrolls only enough to get the element into the viewport.
[2015-07-29 15:37:33] octomeow: oh
[2015-07-29 15:37:34] octomeow: i
[2015-07-29 15:37:38] octomeow: i'll try that, thanks
[2015-07-29 15:37:42] jimevans: set to 0, it scrolls to the top of the viewport.

[2015-07-29 15:43:29] jimevans: though honestly, i forget which value (true or false) means which behavior
[2015-07-29 15:43:36] octomeow: false is bottom
[2015-07-29 15:43:46] octomeow: as we just tested in console
[2015-07-29 15:44:15] jimevans: should do. at least, firefox *used* to support that capability.
[2015-07-29 15:44:21] jimevans: dunno if it still does.
[2015-07-29 15:44:25] octomeow: ok, I'll try it now and tell you
[2015-07-29 15:44:37] jimevans: and the driver should be smart enough not to scroll if the element is already in the view port.

[2015-07-29 15:45:03] jimevans: so the solution of 'scrolling it back into the middle' should work fine.
