[2015-07-28 04:12:04] sgsabbage: WhereIsMySpoon: Chrome upgrade to 44 has, for whatever reason sped up the speed of clicking, reducing the amount of time between the mousedown and the mouseup events in the browser. This is turn has exposed a bug in a ckeditor plugin our app uses
[2015-07-28 04:12:38] sgsabbage: which it's almost impossible to trigger as it requires the mousedown and mouseup events to be fired so close together it's very very difficult for a human to emulate
[2015-07-28 04:12:58] Rollup, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-28 04:13:29] sgsabbage: so in the Element wrapper class I use, I've overriden click() to use the session moveTo, buttonDown and buttonUp commands instead of the native Element click(). It's horrible, I hate it
[2015-07-28 04:14:09] PCatinean: Hmm i'm confused a bit
[2015-07-28 04:14:33] PCatinean: so it's better to install the actual browsers you want to test on the operating system and use them in tests using the webdriver
[2015-07-28 04:14:50] PCatinean: what if for example I do not have Safari or IE on it and still want to test
[2015-07-28 04:15:11] andrewmkrug, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-28 04:15:13] PCatinean: Or what would be the minimum setup to have the tests work with a CI
[2015-07-28 04:17:58] PCatinean: I found this article: https://saucelabs.com/resources/articles/selenium-jenkins-how-to-do-it-yourself-and-the-sauce-labs-advantage
[2015-07-28 04:18:47] sgsabbage: depends very much what your goal is. If you want to make sure the website behaves as it should in a certain browser, you'll need to install that browser
[2015-07-28 04:19:07] sgsabbage: or, pick a browser and install that one
[2015-07-28 04:19:10] sgsabbage: and test against that
[2015-07-28 04:20:02] tony3, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-28 04:24:09] Dave_B_: you can use e.g. remotewebdriver so the install of an OS & browser doesn't have to be on your CI machine :)
[2015-07-28 04:24:34] Dave_B_: ah yeah the sauce labs chat is also a similar idea
[2015-07-28 04:24:47] Dave_B_: jsut they provide the machine for you :)
[2015-07-28 04:25:05] bobacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-28 04:26:17] PCatinean: sgsabbage, and what if general javascript behavior with a bit of ajax here and there?
[2015-07-28 04:28:41] sgsabbage: phantomjs is probably acceptable, or chrome/firefox run headless - or like Dave_B_ says, use remotewebdriver and have a different machine be your node

[2015-07-28 04:36:26] WhereIsMySpoon: PCatinean: will be fine :) if u wanna run headless you can use xvfb and still use chrome/ff

[2015-07-28 05:11:47] sgsabbage: ah, no, it's a single click
[2015-07-28 05:11:54] sgsabbage: as in, the mouse down then mouse up
[2015-07-28 05:11:57] WhereIsMySpoon: er
[2015-07-28 05:11:58] sgsabbage: it's happening faster than it used to
[2015-07-28 05:12:11] sgsabbage: or something. I'm really not sure anymore
[2015-07-28 05:12:20] WhereIsMySpoon: so your widget cant handle the mouse up+down event?
[2015-07-28 05:12:26] WhereIsMySpoon: er down+up
[2015-07-28 05:12:29] WhereIsMySpoon: whatever
[2015-07-28 05:12:54] sgsabbage: I'm not sure - I'm tempted to open a bug with ckeditor because there's an assumption that something won't be destroyed before something else is called
[2015-07-28 05:13:17] sgsabbage: but. I'm not sure anymore, I'm very lost in the whole thing
[2015-07-28 05:13:21] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-07-28 05:13:23] WhereIsMySpoon: sucks
[2015-07-28 05:13:53] sgsabbage: yup!
[2015-07-28 05:14:08] sgsabbage: it almost looks like chrome 44 is generally faster
[2015-07-28 05:14:15] sgsabbage: (which wouldn't surprise me)
[2015-07-28 05:14:39] sgsabbage: but it sees to be breaking bad JS

[2015-07-28 06:25:14] WhereIsMySpoon: if you want to just match by partial <a> text then you can do //td[@class='myclass']/a[contains(text(), 'partial text')]

[2015-07-28 06:25:39] WhereIsMySpoon: '.' is shorthand for text in xpath
[2015-07-28 06:25:46] sgsabbage: also, if the td has multiple classes you might want to use contains(@class,'myclass')

[2015-07-28 07:03:09] sircapsalot: so [class~='something']

[2015-07-28 07:04:05] WhereIsMySpoon: and [class ~= 'something else'] would be what
[2015-07-28 07:04:30] WhereIsMySpoon: could be .something .else .something.else or .else.something right?@
[2015-07-28 07:04:47] sircapsalot: it would match <a class="something else again"> but not <a class="something again else">
[2015-07-28 07:05:11] WhereIsMySpoon: oh right
[2015-07-28 07:05:23] WhereIsMySpoon: surely you could just do contains(@class, 'somethinig else')
[2015-07-28 07:05:38] sircapsalot: definitely.. but that's dependent on order
[2015-07-28 07:05:42] sircapsalot: and you know classes :)
[2015-07-28 07:05:43] WhereIsMySpoon: so is yours
[2015-07-28 07:05:56] sircapsalot: no, you wouldn't use "something else" in ~=
[2015-07-28 07:06:07] sircapsalot: you were asking about that :P  I would just do .something.else
[2015-07-28 07:06:21] sircapsalot: which is === [class~='something'][class~='else']

[2015-07-28 07:07:42] sircapsalot: :P
[2015-07-28 07:08:09] sircapsalot: and i think the answer is no.  seriously there is barely any difference between *= and ~=
[2015-07-28 07:08:12] sircapsalot: other than semantics
[2015-07-28 07:08:19] WhereIsMySpoon: i was gonna say

[2015-07-28 07:41:48] eindoofus: hi, just curious, how does one mix the authentication aspect when using selenium with cucumber? it seems as though every test would require either a manual login or some api authentication behind the scenes. is that typically the case?
[2015-07-28 07:42:44] eindoofus: assuming that a user needs to login to access all the functionality, like in my case
[2015-07-28 07:43:28] Dave_B_: yeah you're not wrong
[2015-07-28 07:43:36] sgsabbage: I would say yes. In my case we have created a 'quick login' method for the testing environment only /login?id=<user id>

[2015-07-28 12:16:44] dimacus: lukeis: yes i did, when i spun up 4 proxies with 4 slots on each, then i started 5 tests, it took up 1 slot on each proxy before it doubled the 2nd slot on the very first proxy… the pattern i see typically is that at least 1 or 2 of the slots will be taken up on the 1st proxy before going to next free proxy

[2015-07-28 12:20:31] AutomatedTester: jimevans: ok... will do it now

[2015-07-28 12:24:00] jimevans: not just the driver
[2015-07-28 12:24:01] lukeis: well, yeah ;)
[2015-07-28 12:25:19] AutomatedTester: I emailed John
[2015-07-28 12:25:25] AutomatedTester: I will start porting now
[2015-07-28 12:26:07] dude-x: dimacus: it used to be a thing i guess

[2015-07-28 12:31:15] lukeis: basically… that change is "too soon"
[2015-07-28 12:31:57] AutomatedTester: when would have been enough time?
[2015-07-28 12:31:58] lukeis: 2.X of selenium != spec… you broke compatibility :)
[2015-07-28 12:32:16] lukeis: when we have spec 1.0 published? :)
[2015-07-28 12:32:54] AutomatedTester: we are going to be in a very awkward place soon
[2015-07-28 12:33:03] AutomatedTester: since MS will be implementing it like that
[2015-07-28 12:33:23] lukeis: selendroid#945

[2015-07-28 12:33:43] asm89: \o
[2015-07-28 12:34:00] lukeis: ;)
[2015-07-28 12:34:06] lukeis: ohai asm89
[2015-07-28 12:34:22] lukeis: selendroid won't work with python right now
[2015-07-28 12:34:51] asm89: que?
[2015-07-28 12:34:59] asm89: < afkish for a bit
[2015-07-28 12:35:05] lukeis: python only finds by css for the most part now
[2015-07-28 12:35:42] asm89: oh fun
[2015-07-28 12:35:44] lukeis: AutomatedTester: i think you should revert it
[2015-07-28 12:36:04] AutomatedTester: ok, and when MS come knocking shortly and EdgeDriver doesnt work?
[2015-07-28 12:36:08] asm89: will the other endpoints be completely deprecated in the end?
[2015-07-28 12:36:29] asm89: because that would be a sad story for mobile e2e testing imo
[2015-07-28 12:36:30] lukeis: AutomatedTester:  it's easier for end users to use "by css" always instead of this current way
[2015-07-28 12:36:53] asm89: having to parse some CSS thingy to find by id etc
[2015-07-28 12:37:15] jimevans: AutomatedTester: MSFT is implementing the driver using the OSS dialect of the wire protocol. once the spec and language bindings are updated, they'll flip the switch to speak the w3c dialect. :)
[2015-07-28 12:37:30] sgsabbage, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2015-07-28 12:37:41] jimevans: edge driver works without any changes whatsoever to the protocol pieces of the java or the .NET bindings.

[2015-07-28 12:38:02] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I thought it also didnt work for finding elements
[2015-07-28 12:38:15] lukeis: it doesn't work only for xpath AFAIK
[2015-07-28 12:38:46] jimevans: it'll find elements just fine.
[2015-07-28 12:39:01] jimevans: just not from an element context (i.e., element.findElement)
[2015-07-28 12:39:18] jimevans: only xpath is broked right now for driver.findElement
[2015-07-28 12:39:52] simonstewart, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-28 12:40:25] jimevans: but i think both java and .net have been updated to understand both element property markers in the JSON responses
[2015-07-28 12:44:08] AutomatedTester: I won't revert but will handle it purely for Marionette
[2015-07-28 12:44:27] *AutomatedTester would like there to be at least one spec compliant implementation floating about'
[2015-07-28 12:45:04] lukeis: i don't like this pattern in the code… capabilities["marionette"] == True   for detecting W3C compliance…
[2015-07-28 12:45:22] jimevans: and again, this is where i strongly consider forking the damned project
[2015-07-28 12:45:29] lukeis: can't it be detected on the new session, to see if the status code is a string or an int?
[2015-07-28 12:45:47] jimevans: we don't return a status on success
[2015-07-28 12:46:09] lukeis: heh
[2015-07-28 12:46:23] jimevans: the 200 of the http request *is* the status
[2015-07-28 12:46:40] lukeis: test for spec compliance by calling an invalid command? :)
[2015-07-28 12:46:59] jimevans: note that the response json no longer has a uniform shape for all responses
[2015-07-28 12:47:06] lukeis: yep
[2015-07-28 12:47:13] AutomatedTester: some the commands are valid but the data structure has changed
[2015-07-28 12:48:13] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i'm not sure what you mean by that.

[2015-07-28 12:49:15] AutomatedTester: I thought I changed one where the data structure was different

[2015-07-28 12:49:19] AutomatedTester: let me look again
[2015-07-28 12:50:01] AutomatedTester: oh it was the page load timeout endpoint
[2015-07-28 12:50:06] AutomatedTester: but that was already updated
[2015-07-28 12:50:51] jimevans: simonstewart: yt?
[2015-07-28 12:51:56] AutomatedTester: jimevans: oh... window switching in the spec has handle but we use name
[2015-07-28 12:52:20] lukeis: why didn't we put a distinguishing attribute in the new session in the spec :)
[2015-07-28 12:52:21] jimevans: yeah, the window handling ones are vastly different from the OSS version
[2015-07-28 12:53:07] lukeis: like "W3C spec compliance level" : "1.0"  :)
[2015-07-28 12:53:08] AutomatedTester: lukeis: we can do
[2015-07-28 12:53:18] jimevans: lukeis: because the spec doesn't care a whit about coexisting with non-spec-compliant implementations
[2015-07-28 12:53:25] jimevans: (and it probably shouldn't)
[2015-07-28 12:53:55] lukeis: well, it should care about compatibility with itself and future versions of itself :)
[2015-07-28 12:54:00] AutomatedTester: (definitely shouldnt)
[2015-07-28 12:54:12] AutomatedTester: lukeis: and the spec does care about it's future self
[2015-07-28 12:54:22] AutomatedTester: thats why we dropped some stuff
[2015-07-28 12:54:36] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i happen to disagree with that assessment, about compatibility, but i'm the only one who does, so i quit yelling about it.
[2015-07-28 12:55:41] AutomatedTester: jimevans: a major version bump would solve this
[2015-07-28 12:56:13] jimevans: not if we anticipate backward compatibility with cross-version local and remote ends. i wish it would.
[2015-07-28 12:56:34] jimevans: and i wish we could afford not to care about that

[2015-07-28 13:02:29] jimevans: since no one can tell me if i'm doing it right.
[2015-07-28 13:04:10] sgsabbage, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-28 13:04:52] AutomatedTester: jimevans: did you ask nirvdrum
[2015-07-28 13:05:07] nirvdrum: Eh?
[2015-07-28 13:05:18] nirvdrum: If jimevans is involved, he's probably not doing it right ;-)
[2015-07-28 13:05:30] nirvdrum: Whatever "it" is.
[2015-07-28 13:05:30] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I think jimevans wants to add a new default browser to grid
[2015-07-28 13:05:34] jimevans: a truism, if i ever heard one.
[2015-07-28 13:05:56] nirvdrum: You just modify the default JSON file.
[2015-07-28 13:06:07] jimevans: o rly?
[2015-07-28 13:06:20] nirvdrum: I believe so.  It's been a while since I've looked.  Give me a few minutes.
[2015-07-28 13:06:45] jimevans: no, i don't care about default at start up. i just want to be able to create a session for a new browser when it's requested.
[2015-07-28 13:07:46] yenaemj_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-28 13:07:48] nirvdrum: Oh.  Well the node just needs to report that it supports that particular browser.

[2015-07-28 13:07:57] nirvdrum: The hub is mostly a dumb proxy.
[2015-07-28 13:08:42] nirvdrum: It sees a request for X, checks if any nodes support X, if not raises an exception (possible to disable), otherwise if capacity is available, fulfills the request, otherwise queues the request.
[2015-07-28 13:09:04] jimevans: i think we're talking at two different places. i'm talking remote server, more than grid.

[2015-07-28 13:15:47] nirvdrum: jimevans: Gotcha.  I think you need to subclass RemoteWebDriver then.
[2015-07-28 13:16:09] nirvdrum: The only time I needed to write a new driver was in the old RC days.
[2015-07-28 13:16:13] jimevans: nirvdrum: i'm not explaining myself.
[2015-07-28 13:16:16] nirvdrum: Heh.
[2015-07-28 13:17:32] jimevans: there has been a new driver (for microsoft edge) added to the java language bindings. however, calling new RemoteWebDriver(…, DesiredCapabilites.edge()), the remote server doesn't know how to create one of those.
[2015-07-28 13:20:29] nirvdrum: jimevans: Looking quickly, it looks like you want to modify the defaultDriverProviders map in org.openqa.selenium.remote.server.DefaultDriverSessions.
[2015-07-28 13:20:53] jimevans: nirvdrum: 3cb0af8
[2015-07-28 13:21:02] jimevans: :)
[2015-07-28 13:21:53] nirvdrum: jimevans: Then I agree with your assessment :-)
[2015-07-28 13:21:58] lukeis: +1 jimevans
[2015-07-28 13:22:19] nirvdrum: Just note that the driver is looked up via reflection, so you'll need to ensure it's available on the classpath.  Ideally it'd be done in the same standalone JAR.
[2015-07-28 13:22:30] jimevans: it is
[2015-07-28 13:22:33] lukeis: AutomatedTester: feels odd that "w3c" response capability is a boolean… but  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-07-28 13:22:45] nirvdrum: jimevans: If you want it available by default in the grid configuration, you should just need to modify the default node config JSON file.
[2015-07-28 13:22:55] AutomatedTester: lukeis: for now
[2015-07-28 13:23:14] jimevans: nirvdrum: that's cool. i'm less worried about that in this iterationg
[2015-07-28 13:23:18] jimevans: or iteration even
[2015-07-28 13:23:27] lukeis: AutomatedTester: wouldn't it make sense to just have the python code be   if capabilites['w3c']:
[2015-07-28 13:23:47] lukeis: or is there a key error possibility?
[2015-07-28 13:24:07] AutomatedTester: It shouldnt be a possibility but who knows what people do to capabilitieis
[2015-07-28 13:24:08] nirvdrum: jimevans: You'd want to look at java/server/src/org/openqa/grid/common/defaults/DefaultNodeWebDriver.json
[2015-07-28 13:24:09] lukeis: yeah...
[2015-07-28 13:24:11] nirvdrum: It should be easy enough.

[2015-07-28 13:25:04] jimevans: lukeis: if you want to eventually have it as version numbers, i could conceive of a remote end that doesn't speak w3c dialect to send "w3c": 0
[2015-07-28 13:25:18] lukeis: which in python would be falsy ;)
[2015-07-28 13:25:26] AutomatedTester: and Ruby

[2015-07-28 13:26:01] jimevans: great.
[2015-07-28 13:26:37] AutomatedTester: hence the explicit bool :)
[2015-07-28 13:26:47] jimevans: nvm. i'm just gonna stay out of it.
