[2015-07-13 07:12:32] amharris: WhereIsMySpoon: The tests aren't hanging, closing the port being used at the end of a session, before proceeding to the next test, is the issue.
[2015-07-13 07:13:13] amharris: WhereIsMySpoon: Selenium tries to run a .quit() but that eventually ends up being [skipping to] a kill, which is nasty.

[2015-07-13 09:22:48] smccarthy: jcun: I do
[2015-07-13 09:22:54] jimevans: yes, almost always. i wish i could to exclusion, but i'm forced to wrestle with RC occasionally.
[2015-07-13 09:22:58] jimevans: No More RC!
[2015-07-13 09:23:14] Dave_B_: ewww
[2015-07-13 09:23:26] *Dave_B_ feels sorry for any who must RC'
[2015-07-13 09:23:29] jcun: cool smccarthy and  jim
[2015-07-13 09:23:30] jcun: what's RC?
[2015-07-13 09:23:35] smccarthy: the old api
[2015-07-13 09:23:42] jcun: i c!
[2015-07-13 09:23:46] Dave_B_: you're better off not knowing, it'll steal your innocence
[2015-07-13 09:23:51] jcun: lol
[2015-07-13 09:23:52] jcun: thanks dave
[2015-07-13 09:24:05] jimevans: woohoo! my msdn renewal just arrived! :)
[2015-07-13 09:24:05] jcun: how are you guys handing events with webdriver?
[2015-07-13 09:24:15] jimevans: in what sense?
[2015-07-13 09:24:17] jcun: wrapping the eventfiringwebdriver?
[2015-07-13 09:24:26] jcun: after clicks navigation etc?
[2015-07-13 09:24:35] jcun: we wrap the eventfiringwebdriver
[2015-07-13 09:24:43] jcun: i was just wonder if you all did the same
[2015-07-13 09:24:51] jimevans: in general, i don't try to use eventfiringwebdriver. don't see much point really.
[2015-07-13 09:25:01] jcun: or wrap the driver into the event firing one
[2015-07-13 09:25:38] jcun: jimevans: how do you perform actions after clicks or page load
[2015-07-13 09:25:51] jcun: say you need to wait for page to finish loading
[2015-07-13 09:25:54] jimevans: wait for the thing i want to operate on to appear on the new page.

[2015-07-13 09:26:16] Dave_B_: for me: WebdriverWait http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp#explicit-waits
[2015-07-13 09:26:17] jcun: what if its the same page
[2015-07-13 09:26:18] jimevans: because "finish loading" is a meaningless term in today's ajax-friendly, javascript-centric web
[2015-07-13 09:26:40] jcun: this is true
[2015-07-13 09:26:43] Dave_B_: same page is fine, you presumably know what it is you need to wait for as if you don't then how do your users?

[2015-07-13 09:27:35] Seth_D, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-13 09:27:40] jcun: yes this is true dave
[2015-07-13 09:28:14] jcun: what if the page is isn't predictable
[2015-07-13 09:28:24] jcun: like a web page that may or may not display a modal
[2015-07-13 09:28:25] Neo--, quitting. (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[2015-07-13 09:28:48] jcun: i think that's the problem we have, Qa doesn't have full control of test environments
[2015-07-13 09:28:49] jimevans: if it's truly a "single page application", that is all DOM manipulation is done via javascript, and not through a browser-level navigation, there's techniques for that, just as there are techniques for if interactions cause a navigation, even if to the same URL.
[2015-07-13 09:29:30] jimevans: a web page that "may or may not display a modal"? that's untestable. you must have a deterministic environment. full stop.
[2015-07-13 09:29:41] Dave_B_: my tests know if their path will arrive on the modal or not… if it's really a randomly-appearing one then I'll probably have an object-initialisation method that just checks for it and dismisses it if found
[2015-07-13 09:30:07] Dave_B_: but generally jim's right, non-determinism has no place in test automation
[2015-07-13 09:30:16] Dave_B_: or really in most websites tbh
[2015-07-13 09:30:31] titusfortner, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-13 09:30:44] jimevans: (and the situation where it's truly random are actually pretty rare. most cases i've seen where people are asking about that, they're trying to do too much with a single method, and not engineering their tests to specifically avoid or trigger the modal in question)
[2015-07-13 09:30:49] jcun: we have a test and target env, where maybe 10% of the users are shown a modal
[2015-07-13 09:30:50] jcun: ha
[2015-07-13 09:31:00] jimevans: then you need a config setting to turn that off.
[2015-07-13 09:31:03] jimevans: full stop.
[2015-07-13 09:31:23] jcun: unfortunately qa doesn't have full control of the env where we can control the settings and data
[2015-07-13 09:31:34] jcun: bah!
[2015-07-13 09:31:38] jimevans: if you can't get your dev group on board with that, escalate to management.
[2015-07-13 09:31:52] jimevans: if you can't change your company, then you need to change your company.
[2015-07-13 09:32:20] jcun: jim!
[2015-07-13 09:32:30] jcun: you're on to something
[2015-07-13 09:32:38] ulmi, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-07-13 09:32:39] jcun: really appreciate your advice
[2015-07-13 09:32:51] jimevans: oh, and i hope i never have to use your product. a UX where 10% of the time i get a modal popup thrown in my face is a product i'll go out of my way not to use. :)
[2015-07-13 09:32:57] WhereIsMySpoon: jcun: ill add my weight to that you -need- to have a predictable environment
[2015-07-13 09:33:09] WhereIsMySpoon: you simply cant test reliably without it
[2015-07-13 09:33:18] jcun: ecommerce
[2015-07-13 09:33:23] jcun: is the product
[2015-07-13 09:33:47] WhereIsMySpoon: what does the test case look like? "test case: click on this button. test results: may or may not show a modal"
[2015-07-13 09:33:54] WhereIsMySpoon: useful test case right there
[2015-07-13 09:34:04] jimevans: and again, i'll go out of my way to shop somewhere else, if i encounter that user experience. just a simple data point for your management team. :)
[2015-07-13 09:34:19] WhereIsMySpoon: there must be a deterministic way this happens, and you need to be able to control that on the QA side
[2015-07-13 09:34:27] WhereIsMySpoon: else you aren't testing so much as flailing
[2015-07-13 09:34:38] jcun: thanks jim
[2015-07-13 09:34:40] WhereIsMySpoon: *press button* "oh look, a thing happened!"

[2015-07-13 09:34:52] Dave_B_: I've got deterministic test envs, but the actual product varies by user and I truly detest it, have argued with product about it repeatedly
[2015-07-13 09:34:53] jcun: we dont' test the modals that are test and target
[2015-07-13 09:34:56] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: or didn't, as the case may be.
[2015-07-13 09:34:58] jcun: spoon
[2015-07-13 09:35:02] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: quite
[2015-07-13 09:35:14] WhereIsMySpoon: jcun: even better, just ignore parts that are badly written
[2015-07-13 09:35:20] WhereIsMySpoon: that'll surely make your product great /s
[2015-07-13 09:35:37] jcun: where just try to close all modals in event handlers
[2015-07-13 09:35:42] WhereIsMySpoon: jcun: not aiming this at you btw
[2015-07-13 09:35:53] jcun: so ever time a navigation occurs event handler method is called
[2015-07-13 09:36:02] jcun: and we look for any modals
[2015-07-13 09:36:04] jcun:  and kill them
[2015-07-13 09:36:05] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2015-07-13 09:36:12] WhereIsMySpoon: why not just not display them in the first place
[2015-07-13 09:36:17] WhereIsMySpoon: wth is this lol
[2015-07-13 09:36:25] jcun: haha np spoon
[2015-07-13 09:36:34] jimevans: yeah, but the problem with that is you're wasting time looking for modals. and you'll never, *ever* know for certain that you've waited long enough.
[2015-07-13 09:36:35] jimevans: :)
[2015-07-13 09:36:36] WhereIsMySpoon: im not sure i wanna know
[2015-07-13 09:36:37] amharris, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2015-07-13 09:36:44] jcun: exactly jim, our test are slow lol
[2015-07-13 09:36:53] WhereIsMySpoon: and unreliable
[2015-07-13 09:37:15] jcun: well the tests are running pretty well just slow
[2015-07-13 09:37:19] WhereIsMySpoon: you dont have deterministic states, you cannot say that your tests are reliable
[2015-07-13 09:37:25] WhereIsMySpoon: it isnt logically possible
[2015-07-13 09:37:30] jcun: ha
[2015-07-13 09:37:38] jcun: k
[2015-07-13 09:37:43] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon is being dogmatic, but he's not wrong.
[2015-07-13 09:37:49] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe one modal got stuck
[2015-07-13 09:37:52] Dave_B_: so long as you just don't test the non-deterministic areas they could be ok
[2015-07-13 09:37:56] Dave_B_: ish
[2015-07-13 09:38:00] jcun: np
[2015-07-13 09:38:01] WhereIsMySpoon: network issues, browser hanging, etc

[2015-07-13 09:38:34] jimevans: yep, the best ui-based test is the one you never write. :)
[2015-07-13 09:38:38] WhereIsMySpoon: a lot of us are actually developers ourselves
[2015-07-13 09:38:53] WhereIsMySpoon: who also masquerade as automation engineers
[2015-07-13 09:38:54] Dave_B_: :D aye, they're my fave too jim
[2015-07-13 09:39:02] jcun: that's awesome, cool
[2015-07-13 09:39:04] WhereIsMySpoon: such as myself
[2015-07-13 09:39:22] jimevans: and i say this as someone who's built an entire career out of ui-based automated testing.
[2015-07-13 09:39:32] WhereIsMySpoon: jcun: as jim will say and I echo, it's vital to get an actual coder to do automated testing
[2015-07-13 09:39:36] Dave_B_: I'm formerly a developer but been in test automation so long I'm not sure anyone would hire me for normal dev work any more :(
[2015-07-13 09:39:44] jcun: yeah i was a soft eng for 7 years
[2015-07-13 09:40:07] jcun: primarily java
