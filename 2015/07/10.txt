[2015-07-10 06:35:18] philippp: great, thanks! So, I had a look at the StaleTolerantWrapper (from https://github.com/barancev/webdriver-extensions)
[2015-07-10 06:35:49] philippp: Is there any way to cast the StaleTolerant driver to an RemoteWebDriver
[2015-07-10 06:36:31] philippp: Because when I try to do that I'll get ClassCastException: com.sun.proxy.$Proxy9 cannot be cast to org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver
[2015-07-10 06:36:43] philippp: which makes sense I guess
[2015-07-10 06:40:17] WhereIsMySpoon: no clue but I'll hope barancev is able to help you in a bit :)

[2015-07-10 06:50:05] andrewmkrug, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-10 06:51:47] philippp: For example in some places I would like to check if the current driver is an IE driver for additional workarounds
[2015-07-10 06:52:00] philippp: or if the current driver is an AppiumDriver
[2015-07-10 06:52:01] barancev: well, you can store capabilities before wrapping the driver
[2015-07-10 06:52:34] philippp: yes that would work I guess...
[2015-07-10 06:54:02] philippp: but might need some more refactoring :)

[2015-07-10 06:54:18] WhereIsMySpoon: ;)
[2015-07-10 06:54:29] philippp: Anyway I think the StaleTolerantWrapper seems great

I am using it with a scrapy spider that is running concurrent requests. it seems the spider crawls the urls quickly but the whole thing slows down with parsing with phantomjs. I also wonder if its truly using multiple instances of phantomjs. Do I need to do anything special to make sure multiple instances of phantom are being used?

[2015-07-10 12:05:52] jonahss: hello wonderful test automation enthusiasts
[2015-07-10 12:06:15] jonahss: I'm trying to use the java client to get all sessions running on a selenium server
[2015-07-10 12:06:25] jonahss: i should be hitting the /sessions endpoint
[2015-07-10 12:06:38] jonahss: in the java client theres a command handler for getAllSessions
[2015-07-10 12:06:49] jonahss: but, for the life of me, I can't figure out how to call it
[2015-07-10 12:07:58] jimevans: jonahss: where's the command handler?
[2015-07-10 12:07:59] lukeis: if you're using the standalone server…. http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/sessions  would be the default path/port
[2015-07-10 12:08:08] lukeis: hit it in your web browser
[2015-07-10 12:08:25] jimevans: and yeah, there's not a client-side webdriver api to get that for you.

[2015-07-10 12:10:32] jonahss: ha yeah it works fine hitting via browser or curl. was looking for how to hit that using java driver.
[2015-07-10 12:10:39] jonahss: ah thanks jimevans
[2015-07-10 12:10:40] lukeis: it's not intended for 'driver client' consumption… rather for selenium-grid related activities
[2015-07-10 12:10:51] jonahss: riiiiight yeah that makes sense. hm
[2015-07-10 12:11:26] jonahss: there's this file here: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/01399fffecd5a20af6f31aed6cb0043c9c5cde65/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/server/handler/GetAllSessions.java
[2015-07-10 12:12:11] jonahss: a user is asking me how to get all the sessions on a server, and they use java. Should I suggest they just write their own json http command marshaler?
[2015-07-10 12:12:49] lukeis: you can get the server url / port / base url from the http command object
[2015-07-10 12:13:09] lukeis: the 'remote connection' or whatever it's called
[2015-07-10 12:13:36] jonahss: 'getRemoteAddress()' found it
[2015-07-10 12:14:32] jonahss: oh interesting. i see that 'getRemoteStatus' is deprecated
[2015-07-10 12:15:35] jimevans: git clone cloney mcclone clone….
[2015-07-10 12:17:12] jonahss: oh, can i submit a PR to add these commands?
[2015-07-10 12:17:20] jonahss: i figured they're not in there for a reason
[2015-07-10 12:17:27] lukeis: which commands?
[2015-07-10 12:17:46] jonahss: kinda makes sense. if you're just testing with a driver, there's no particular reason to hit the /status or /sessions endpoints
[2015-07-10 12:18:04] jonahss: but iv'e used them
[2015-07-10 12:18:18] jonahss: a bunch of other clients include the commands
[2015-07-10 12:18:22] jonahss: and a user is asking for them
[2015-07-10 12:18:39] lukeis: i would tell them "no" :)
[2015-07-10 12:19:17] jimevans: yep. i'd say "no" also, and i'd reject outright any pull request to the .NET bindings that tried to add them.
[2015-07-10 12:19:17] jonahss: ah. here's the actual use case
[2015-07-10 12:19:38] jonahss: the use case is as follows:
[2015-07-10 12:19:58] gabecase, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-07-10 12:20:09] jonahss: a user wants to know wether a session is already in progress on the server. before instantiating a new driver
[2015-07-10 12:20:29] jonahss: (i think they want to also connect to the currently running session if there is one)
[2015-07-10 12:20:35] gabecase, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-10 12:20:41] jonahss: which they can do just by setting the sessionId
[2015-07-10 12:21:16] jimevans: oh dear {$diety}. it's the "i want to connect to an existing browser" thing.
[2015-07-10 12:21:20] *jimevans sighs heavily'
[2015-07-10 12:21:21] leandroal, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-10 12:21:29] jonahss: lol
[2015-07-10 12:21:50] jonahss: if u just set the sessionId it works
[2015-07-10 12:22:03] jimevans: yes, that's a very very lucky side effect.
[2015-07-10 12:22:06] jonahss: erm. ive never quit understood the motivations for is but.....
[2015-07-10 12:22:26] jonahss: *typos*
[2015-07-10 12:23:19] jonahss: some people have used it for handling their test code in two different files. like um... passing off a driver from one suite to another or something
[2015-07-10 12:23:20] jimevans: most of the time i've heard people want to do it, they justify it with something like, "but my app has to login to do anything meaningful, and i don't want to have to re-login for every time."
[2015-07-10 12:24:12] jonahss: erg. then they have to reset state back to their "home" page at the end of every test. yuck.
[2015-07-10 12:24:57] jimevans: yes, that road is usually fraught with fraughtiness
[2015-07-10 12:25:23] jimevans: far easier to avoid the ui login process altogether.
[2015-07-10 12:26:38] jonahss: still. an endpoint's and endpoint
[2015-07-10 12:26:43] jonahss: an*
[2015-07-10 12:33:32] jonahss: oh well. let them eat cake, I say. i'll reap the rewards of fraught users later down the road
[2015-07-10 12:34:06] jimevans: i'd much rather educate them on a Better Way™
[2015-07-10 12:35:29] jonahss: I like to provide reliable tools and let people improvise and get creative rather than actually tell them the best way of doing things. eventually they figure out the right way themselves or come up with a really entertaining method that sometimes surprises you in its usefulness ;)
[2015-07-10 12:35:38] jonahss: or they pester ur forums forever :(
[2015-07-10 12:36:29] jonahss: what `ho. this is why there's an open api. different clients get to try out different paradigms
[2015-07-10 12:36:33] jimevans: didn't say "best," i said "better"
[2015-07-10 12:36:40] jonahss: ooooh. noted.
[2015-07-10 12:37:13] jonahss: i retract the tone of my message then
[2015-07-10 12:37:20] jimevans: thank you
