[2015-07-08 14:05:23] octomeow: ...or not.
[2015-07-08 14:05:47] lukeis: your own fault for relying on that third party library :-D
[2015-07-08 14:05:57] jimevans: alright. someone smarter than me is going to have to dig into the CI issue for IE 7, 8, and 9. it looks like the tests aren't able to start a session.
[2015-07-08 14:06:00] octomeow: I mean, what else should I use for Appium?
[2015-07-08 14:06:01] mik3: octomeow, lukeis, I've tried reproducing it manually with no luck.  Which is why I'm hesitant to log a defect without attempting to clear it to see if that changes the behavior.  My thinking is that if it works, then there's a session issue that I'll need to scout out.  So far though manually, I'm unable to reproduce
[2015-07-08 14:06:29] mik3: Ignore my redundant last sentence :))
[2015-07-08 14:06:30] octomeow: jimevans, *gasp* I thought you were the smartest one! Now we're doomed...
[2015-07-08 14:06:32] AutomatedTester: juangj: can you (or the team) look at the IE7/8/9 issues on the CI?
[2015-07-08 14:06:48] pte_petey: hi #selenium how's it going :)

[2015-07-08 14:07:02] lukeis: AutomatedTester: it may be a saucelabs issue
[2015-07-08 14:07:21] octomeow: mik3, sometimes you log out and log in with your test too fast so the system is actually using previous credentials, I saw that happen. have you tried setting delays and see what happens?
[2015-07-08 14:08:11] octomeow: lukeis, the question is, what should I use instead for Appium?
[2015-07-08 14:08:15] mik3: octomeow (read Donatello), that's a BRILLIANT notion
[2015-07-08 14:08:49] lukeis: octomeow: just the regular 'ol RemoteWebDriver? (that's what I do...)
[2015-07-08 14:09:01] mik3: Let me see if that does anything
[2015-07-08 14:09:55] octomeow: mik3, lots of experience with flaky/slow webapps is speaking here :D
[2015-07-08 14:10:59] jimevans: btw, octomeow, i figured out the issue we were looking at last night.
[2015-07-08 14:13:57] octomeow: jimevans, that's cool. is it on my side?
[2015-07-08 14:14:20] jimevans: kinda, but not really. it's an artifact of that particular element.
[2015-07-08 14:14:55] jimevans: let me bring it up, and i can explain more clearly.
[2015-07-08 14:15:05] octomeow: lukeis, hmm, let me see into it...

[2015-07-08 14:17:07] jimevans: the element in question is an <a> element, which, when you click on it, opens the side bar with the settings menu.
[2015-07-08 14:17:41] jimevans: it *looks* like, to the user, that the element's bounds are simply the "hamburger" menu
[2015-07-08 14:18:08] jimevans: however, upon inspecting the DOM, there's a <span> that's inside the <a>
[2015-07-08 14:18:32] eteixeira_, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2015-07-08 14:18:57] octomeow: yup
[2015-07-08 14:19:10] trentp, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-07-08 14:19:17] octomeow: lukeis, but now I can't use FindElementByAndroidUIAutomator! and that was the main reason to use that...
[2015-07-08 14:19:20] jimevans: and if you look at where IE thinks that span should be rendered (using the IE F12 Developer Tools), you'll see that it thinks it should be rendered below the 'hamburger' menu.
[2015-07-08 14:19:54] octomeow: jimevans, oh, makes sense. but why does it respond to double-click then?
[2015-07-08 14:20:22] jimevans: so that means that if you all getBoundingClientRect() on the <a> element, you get both the 'hamburger' graphic *and* the invisible <span>
[2015-07-08 14:20:46] octomeow: oh. ooooh...
[2015-07-08 14:21:20] jimevans: the way it's rendered, that means the center of the full element (which is where IWebElement.Click() tries to click) isn't *in* the hamburger menu
[2015-07-08 14:21:57] jimevans: (i'm speculating about the getBoundingClientRect part. i haven't actually tried that yet)
[2015-07-08 14:22:26] lukeis: octomeow: here, we wrap RWD and add methods as need be… or you can just update your implementation based on their changes ;)
[2015-07-08 14:22:30] jimevans: however, by using the Actions class, you can tell the driver to click at an offset from the upper-left corner of the element, rather than in the dead center.
[2015-07-08 14:22:36] jimevans: and this works.
[2015-07-08 14:23:13] octomeow: lukeis, yeah, looks like instead of porting their code to my wrapper it's easier to adapt my code for their changes for now
[2015-07-08 14:23:19] octomeow: less painful, at least

[2015-07-08 14:24:11] octomeow: jimevans, thanks for the investigation, at least I know I can make a workaround now.
[2015-07-08 14:24:22] jimevans: now, it's possible i'm wrong.
[2015-07-08 14:24:45] jimevans: but i *do* know that the Actions workaround works. i've just tested it.
[2015-07-08 14:25:31] octomeow: jimevans, that gives me lots of information to work with :)
[2015-07-08 14:25:54] jimevans: i'd have to debug into the driver to discover what the coordinate calculations actually are.
[2015-07-08 14:25:59] jimevans: for the driver, i mean.
[2015-07-08 14:27:51] mik3: octomeow, my updated test is running now *fingers crossed*
[2015-07-08 14:28:26] mik3: have you ever had bad latency issues with browserstack or saucelabs?
