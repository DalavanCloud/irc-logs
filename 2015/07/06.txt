[2015-07-06 05:46:33] Dave_B_: your test code is multi-threaded but to actually have any gains you're relying on quite specific behaviour from the driver that I really doubt you can be sure of

[2015-07-06 05:48:35] leandroal_: Dave_B_,  I can't do that because I don't know if the element is loaded or not... I can't simply set implicit wait to 0 since elements can be dinamically loaded and I don't know which one will be loaded first due to network latency. What I now is that I have to take an action once at least one of them appear. If I don't use multi-thread I will not be able to do that.
[2015-07-06 05:49:16] leandroal_: What I know*

[2015-07-06 05:53:45] leandroal_: Dave_B_,  Suppose, for example, the login feature of a website. If login is success I will take an action (I know that is was success because the page will be loaded with an exit button. If the login is not success, there will not be an exit button, instead it will show a div with an error message. The problem is: I don't now how many seconds any of these two elements (button and a div) will appear. If I do a findElement for waiting for the exit b
[2015-07-06 05:53:45] leandroal_: utton, but what happen was an error in the login, I will have to wait the implicit type to get a NoSuchElementException and then findElement(div_error), which will take much more time.
[2015-07-06 05:54:28] AutomatedTester: Selenium has no requirement to work multithreaded
[2015-07-06 05:54:34] leandroal_: Instead, I created two threads, one to do findElement(exit button) and other findElement(div element).
[2015-07-06 05:54:41] AutomatedTester: and as such probably wont work very well
[2015-07-06 05:54:49] leandroal_: AutomatedTester,  ok, so, can you please suggest an alternative for my case?
[2015-07-06 05:54:59] Dave_B_: don'#t implicit wait
[2015-07-06 05:55:09] Dave_B_: explicit wait, it ignores nosuchelement by default
[2015-07-06 05:55:26] AutomatedTester: leandroal_: WebDriverWait ?

[2015-07-06 06:28:51] Dave_B_: no need for threads

[2015-07-06 06:31:15] Dave_B_: pretty trivial to do really - though it will require you to not use implicit waits or you'll suffer a huge performance hit (which you may suffer with threading also, again because you are not controlling the driver-side threading and you may get some very unexpected results)

[2015-07-06 06:55:27] mekhami: I was just looking for a link to the driver.Url property
[2015-07-06 06:55:38] mekhami: in the chrome driver, which offlinked me to the RemoteWebDriver
[2015-07-06 06:55:58] mekhami: which is "correct" in that's where it originates from
[2015-07-06 06:56:49] AutomatedTester: mekhami: all drivers are "RemoteWebDriver" which might not always be obvious
