[2015-07-16 02:15:37] sgsabbage: PCatinean: I can't provide a lot of support on this, but the command I used to use (before I moved to non-headless tests) was to start the server with something like: xvfb-run --server-args="-screen 0 1440x900x24" java -jar /path/to/selenium-server-standalone.jar
[2015-07-16 02:15:49] sgsabbage: that's off the top of my head so it may require tweaking
[2015-07-16 02:15:57] sgsabbage: (you can also just use -s instead of --server-args)
[2015-07-16 02:15:59] PCatinean: the selenium server?
[2015-07-16 02:16:07] sgsabbage: yes
[2015-07-16 02:16:18] PCatinean: I just did import in python and started testing, don't think I have the selenium server installed/running

[2015-07-16 02:26:33] WhereIsMySpoon: yes, when you get selenium going for real you'll want to use Grid and remote webdriver

[2015-07-16 02:38:28] Dave_B_: how do you trigger your tests? If you're using e.g. nosetest you could do@

[2015-07-16 02:39:18] Dave_B_: or whatever
[2015-07-16 02:39:40] Dave_B_: hmm, think that shouldn't be using screen 0 actually really, tho it'll probably work ok
[2015-07-16 02:41:55] sgsabbage: yeah - I only went with screen 0 because that's what I originally did

[2015-07-16 02:49:30] Dave_B_: very scalable, can run many tests in parallel, can handle cross-browser testing easily, it's good :)
[2015-07-16 02:49:55] Dave_B_: can run an in-house grid or swap out to external vendors like saucelabs or browserstack very easily
[2015-07-16 02:50:29] Dave_B_: can run against any OS without having to have the actual test code run on the OS, just the browser (and driver)
[2015-07-16 02:51:41] PCatinean: I assume it's not easy to setup
[2015-07-16 02:52:32] WhereIsMySpoon: PCatinean:wrong
[2015-07-16 02:53:54] WhereIsMySpoon: PCatinean: literally you need to start the selenium jar on your CI machine as a hub and then on the machine your tests will actually run as a node giving the (I think) -hub argument and passing the address of the hub in
[2015-07-16 02:54:11] WhereIsMySpoon: then on your code side you use remotewebdriver instead of WebDriver.Firefox or WebDriver.Chrome
[2015-07-16 02:54:12] PCatinean: I see
[2015-07-16 02:54:35] WhereIsMySpoon: and pass in DesiredCapabilities.chrome or DesiredCapabilities.firefox (whatever those are in python)
[2015-07-16 02:54:44] WhereIsMySpoon: google grid setup
[2015-07-16 02:54:49] WhereIsMySpoon: there will be lots of info
[2015-07-16 02:54:53] WhereIsMySpoon: but its really pissing easy
[2015-07-16 02:55:16] WhereIsMySpoon: the hardest part will be to get it running on the node with xvfb but even that shouldnt be too hard
[2015-07-16 02:55:18] WhereIsMySpoon: again, google

[2015-07-16 02:58:30] PCatinean: I'll try to integrate it with the current framework somehow
[2015-07-16 02:58:33] p0deje, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-16 03:05:35] Dave_B_: in python you can do desired_capabilities as a dictionary (browserName = whatever browser you want)

[2015-07-16 04:16:18] sgsabbage: ta
[2015-07-16 04:16:54] EdwardIII: funny thing is, i bet if it wasn't headless i'd see what was up heh
[2015-07-16 04:17:50] sgsabbage: I assume that http://localhost works fine?
[2015-07-16 04:18:54] EdwardIII: sgsabbage: yup, works OK when i hit it with curl
[2015-07-16 04:19:06] EdwardIII: one thing, i don't actually stop the webdriver yet in my test
[2015-07-16 04:19:07] sgsabbage: does it ever timeout/error or does it just sit there forever?
[2015-07-16 04:19:29] EdwardIII: seems to just sit there forever
[2015-07-16 04:19:38] sgsabbage: hmm
[2015-07-16 04:21:22] sgsabbage: let me try spinning ff up locally, see if I can get expected output
[2015-07-16 04:22:42] EdwardIII: hrm OK i tried running it non-headlessly on another machine
[2015-07-16 04:23:09] EdwardIII: and i get Got result: ERROR: Element id=confirmation_studentContact_firstName not found on session 8f37627f30c747dbb19349ec524628cd

[2015-07-16 04:25:17] EdwardIII: butbut then it actually opens firefox and attempts to run the test
[2015-07-16 04:25:43] EdwardIII: hmm ok ran it that time it even completed OK
[2015-07-16 04:26:21] EdwardIII: puzzling

[2015-07-16 04:29:44] sgsabbage: weird - what bindings are you using out of interest?
[2015-07-16 04:30:39] EdwardIII: sgsabbage: whichever ones come with phpunit-selenium
[2015-07-16 04:30:50] sgsabbage: oh, ok, you're on ph
[2015-07-16 04:30:52] sgsabbage: *php
[2015-07-16 04:31:04] EdwardIII: world of toiletcraft
[2015-07-16 04:32:03] sgsabbage: so, idly, this may have nothing to do with it, giorgiosironi/phpunit-selenium uses the RC (old) API
[2015-07-16 04:32:30] EdwardIII: hrm
[2015-07-16 04:32:41] sgsabbage: ..well, I say that. The documentation says that, the code does not, handy
[2015-07-16 04:32:57] EdwardIII: heh
[2015-07-16 04:33:03] sgsabbage: Are you using Selenium2TestCase?
[2015-07-16 04:33:12] EdwardIII: hrm i'm using PHPUnit_Extensions_SeleniumTestCase
[2015-07-16 04:33:36] sgsabbage: Try PHPUnit_Extensions_Selenium2TestCase if it will let you
[2015-07-16 04:33:48] EdwardIII: hmm that says PHPUnit_Extensions_Selenium2TestCase_WebDriverException: The path to the driver executable must be set by the phantomjs.binary.path capability/system property/PATH variable; for more information, see https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki. The latest version can be downloaded from http://phantomjs.org/download.html
[2015-07-16 04:33:53] EdwardIII: is that right?
[2015-07-16 04:34:12] sgsabbage: sounds like it's not sending the right desiredcapabilities there
[2015-07-16 04:35:00] sgsabbage: what's your setUp() (or wherever you're setting up the browser session) look like?
[2015-07-16 04:35:07] EdwardIII: hehe it says "adMethodCallException: The command 'open' is not existent or not supported yet."
[2015-07-16 04:35:32] EdwardIII: sgsabbage: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/dfe7b6cdea9019d9e5fe
[2015-07-16 04:35:40] sgsabbage: okay, try
[2015-07-16 04:35:54] sgsabbage: $this->setBrowser("firefox") and $this->url instead of open
[2015-07-16 04:36:35] EdwardIII: ok! 1s
[2015-07-16 04:37:01] EdwardIII: interestingly i just tried manually creating a profile then calling it: java -jar /usr/local/bin/selenium-server -Dwebdriver.firefox.profile=functionaltest
[2015-07-16 04:37:26] EdwardIII: and selenium just spins away happily forever, never actually gives access (i.e. it never says RemoteWebDriver instances should connect to: http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub)
[2015-07-16 04:38:06] sgsabbage: odd
[2015-07-16 04:38:18] EdwardIII: ah wait, it does, it just takes AGES
[2015-07-16 04:38:43] EdwardIII: but then when i try and exec a test it still says "12:30:44.187 INFO - Preparing Firefox profile..."
[2015-07-16 04:40:21] EdwardIII: hrm ok no it just always takes ages now

[2015-07-16 04:45:34] EdwardIII: i wanna check i'm seeing a booking id in the content
[2015-07-16 04:47:48] EdwardIII: heh i sort of... can't find it
[2015-07-16 04:48:01] EdwardIII: PHPUnit_Extensions_Selenium2TestCase doesn't have a method like getBody or anything like that

[2015-07-16 04:49:07] sgsabbage: I think
[2015-07-16 04:49:34] EdwardIII: ah yeah there it is
[2015-07-16 04:49:45] sgsabbage: I mean, there are probably better ways to do it than that - pick the element where the booking id is using css, then assert the value of the element

[2015-07-16 05:07:37] EdwardIII: sgsabbage: hrm i'm not sure how this helps? the old API just has ->type('some keys')
[2015-07-16 05:08:33] EdwardIII: sgsabbage: oooh wait
[2015-07-16 05:08:40] sgsabbage: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/keys
[2015-07-16 05:08:59] sgsabbage: hopefully that didn't turn into an emoticon in your IRC client as it did mine..
[2015-07-16 05:09:46] EdwardIII: hrm OK so the API includes PHPUnit_Extensions_Selenium2TestCase_SessionCommand_Keys->keysForText($text)
[2015-07-16 05:10:04] EdwardIII: so how the hell do i use that hehe...
[2015-07-16 05:10:49] EdwardIII: wait wtf, stupid me!
[2015-07-16 05:11:09] EdwardIII: the actual Selenium2TestCase object has a keys() method

[2015-07-16 05:14:40] sgsabbage: it uses the magic __call() method
[2015-07-16 05:16:08] EdwardIII: whoa
[2015-07-16 05:16:16] EdwardIII: well the reason i was looking was because i was trying to find out what args it takes
[2015-07-16 05:18:22] sgsabbage: the Keys session command in the library handles splitting it out, so you should just be able to send it a string
[2015-07-16 05:18:57] sgsabbage: or, if you were sending it an array of parameters, you could send it: [ 'value' => [ 'k', 'e', 'y', 's' ] ]

[2015-07-16 06:34:15] erwyn: (I'm using the selenium IDE btw)
[2015-07-16 06:34:16] EdwardIII: .click is the same, right?
[2015-07-16 06:35:05] EdwardIII: erwyn: not sure i get your question

[2015-07-16 06:35:40] erwyn: When I use assertText on Some text it always return true cause a child of my div contains it

[2015-07-16 06:45:35] sgsabbage: EdwardIII: You don't have to use keys() specifically, that just types at the screen. You could select an element and then use ->value($value) on that object - see the jsonwireprotocol for how things break down
[2015-07-16 06:45:48] sgsabbage: erwyn: As I understand it the IDE is deprecated and no longer supported

[2015-07-16 06:49:12] jimevans: EdwardIII: selenese (or at least the RC API) has been deprecated longer than IDE.
[2015-07-16 06:49:34] erwyn: jimevans: is there anything else? to quickly build test suites?
[2015-07-16 06:49:42] erwyn: that replaces the ide?
[2015-07-16 06:49:50] EdwardIII: well how about that
[2015-07-16 06:50:40] jimevans: and to be totally honest, IDE isn't so much as deprecated as no one is interested in maintaining it. in theory there's a "selenium builder" project that was supposed to be donated to the selenium project, but i don't know the legal status of that intellectual property, and no one has done any work to integrate it into the current code base.
[2015-07-16 06:51:46] jimevans: i mean, there's been steady messaging from the selenium project that RC is going away for at least 3 years now.

[2015-07-16 06:52:50] erwyn: It felt quicker to use the IDE
[2015-07-16 06:52:58] erwyn: than the whole language binding stuff
[2015-07-16 06:53:43] EdwardIII: yeah the IDE was awesome
[2015-07-16 06:53:46] jimevans: well, again, it's a "no one is interested" problem. this project is fully volunteer. there's no "selenium foundation" funding work on it. there's no developers on payroll to maintain it.

[2015-07-16 06:56:33] jimevans: i personally have no interest in maintaining a record-playback mechanism, because i don't believe in its efficacy for producing maintainable code.

[2015-07-16 08:02:00] jimevans: "wait for page load" is an obsolete concept in today's javascript-heavy, ajax-informed web

[2015-07-16 08:02:14] EdwardIII: it's exactly what i need here
[2015-07-16 08:02:29] jimevans: define "page loaded" in a way that applies to all web pages.
[2015-07-16 08:02:41] EdwardIII: nobody can
[2015-07-16 08:02:57] jimevans: which is why the webdriver api has no such concept.
[2015-07-16 08:02:59] EdwardIII: but in my instance i just mean "waitUntilTheSubmitHasCompletedAndTheServerHasReturnedAResponse"
[2015-07-16 08:03:10] EdwardIII: no fancy schmacy stuff
[2015-07-16 08:03:21] jimevans: so, looking at the page, how do you know the server has returned a response?
[2015-07-16 08:03:46] EdwardIII: because i see 'response: ...' in the network tab
[2015-07-16 08:04:02] jimevans: that's not looking at the page. that's looking at the developer tools.
[2015-07-16 08:04:04] jimevans: try again.
[2015-07-16 08:04:04] EdwardIII: or just because i see the page start to load
[2015-07-16 08:04:32] jimevans: but you don't know it's been loaded.
[2015-07-16 08:04:37] EdwardIII: i do
[2015-07-16 08:04:41] EdwardIII: i know the html has been returned
[2015-07-16 08:04:44] jimevans: how?
[2015-07-16 08:04:57] EdwardIII: because i can see the browser trying to render it
[2015-07-16 08:05:06] jimevans: how do you know that the DOM has been parsed and what you're actually looking for has been rendered?
[2015-07-16 08:05:07] WhereIsMySpoon: EdwardIII: there must be a change in the dom on the page that you can see, maybe some new text appears?
[2015-07-16 08:05:12] WhereIsMySpoon: or some image appears?
[2015-07-16 08:05:25] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: thanks for walking over my socratic method. :)
[2015-07-16 08:05:34] WhereIsMySpoon: eh sorry
[2015-07-16 08:05:58] EdwardIII: i'm familiar with the complexities and ambiguity of what constitutes a page being "ready" in natural language

[2015-07-16 08:06:16] WhereIsMySpoon: EdwardIII: that's a nice non-answer
[2015-07-16 08:06:21] EdwardIII: and i understand why selenium can't support a one-size-fits-all mechanism for that
[2015-07-16 08:06:33] jimevans: EdwardIII: my point is that there is a technique that people use with webdriver.
[2015-07-16 08:07:04] jimevans: you identify a condition on the page that indicates enough of it has loaded to interact with the element you're actually interested in, then wait for that condition.
[2015-07-16 08:07:15] jimevans: often, it's the presence of a specific element in the DOM of the target pge
[2015-07-16 08:07:20] jimevans: or page even
[2015-07-16 08:07:22] EdwardIII: yes that's fine
[2015-07-16 08:07:31] EdwardIII: but what the heck is that called in the php api?
[2015-07-16 08:07:36] WhereIsMySpoon: for example, if you were testing http://google.com you might test that the google logo appears and the search bar appears
[2015-07-16 08:07:51] jimevans: oh. php. you're on your own there.
[2015-07-16 08:07:56] WhereIsMySpoon: ew
[2015-07-16 08:08:06] EdwardIII: what's it called in your implementation? i can probably work back from there
[2015-07-16 08:08:14] WhereIsMySpoon: EdwardIII: it's called work_in_a_better_language_func
[2015-07-16 08:08:18] WhereIsMySpoon: /s
[2015-07-16 08:08:20] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-07-16 08:08:27] EdwardIII: very helpful, thanks
[2015-07-16 08:08:38] WhereIsMySpoon: awh i was just messing :) in java its WebDriverWait
[2015-07-16 08:09:00] jimevans: the php community's obsession with "not-invented-here" and the proliferation of different language bindings astounds me. only second to the javascript community's, but only because there's an "official" javascript binding.
[2015-07-16 08:09:04] WhereIsMySpoon: EdwardIII: I'd like to point out an actual issue with the php bindings which is that they are not officially supported by the selenium team
[2015-07-16 08:09:08] kggr, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-07-16 08:09:17] WhereIsMySpoon: therefore they will lag behind the "official" binding langs
[2015-07-16 08:09:27] WhereIsMySpoon: also there are like 5 different php bindings
[2015-07-16 08:09:32] WhereIsMySpoon: for no reason
[2015-07-16 08:09:37] jimevans: but yes, the concept in most official bindings is called "webdriverwait"
[2015-07-16 08:09:45] EdwardIII: hrm this api has waitUntil($callback)
[2015-07-16 08:09:49] jimevans: and essentially, it polls the page for a condidtion.
[2015-07-16 08:09:52] EdwardIII: WhereIsMySpoon: well also it's PHP so, it will be crap
[2015-07-16 08:09:53] jimevans: or condition

[2015-07-16 08:10:37] EdwardIII: PHP is the worst popular language imo
[2015-07-16 08:10:38] jimevans: sounds like whichever bindings you're using has a wait construct, so that would probably be the right thing to use.
[2015-07-16 08:10:47] WhereIsMySpoon: EdwardIII: so why are you using it

[2015-07-16 08:12:30] WhereIsMySpoon: you dont have to write selenium tests in the same language as your web app..
[2015-07-16 08:12:39] jimevans: which is a perfectly legitimate reason to decide on a language.

[2015-07-16 08:12:59] WhereIsMySpoon: is that corpus or corpse :P
[2015-07-16 08:13:03] EdwardIII: e.g. inject a mock API client
[2015-07-16 08:13:06] WhereIsMySpoon: EdwardIII: ah ok fair enough
[2015-07-16 08:13:40] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: you don't have to, but if your company has a large knowledge base of expertise in a specific language because of personnel, that's a very good reason to choose the same language as your app.
[2015-07-16 08:14:15] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: sure, but EdwardIII sounded like he personally also didnt like php
[2015-07-16 08:14:19] WhereIsMySpoon: so
[2015-07-16 08:14:27] WhereIsMySpoon: but yea i understand that

[2015-07-16 08:23:10] WhereIsMySpoon: EdwardIII: by "repo objects to do smart stuff" do you mean data bindings and such?
