[2015-07-31 00:42:03] Surum: If particular item in webpage loads (it loads like 50% of the time, aka, a/b test), I'd like to quit driver and restart all code again, but here I run into issue that after driver.quit() I reinitialize driver, it opens up again, but does not stay in same code and thus does not continue my code. Any suggestions how to do quit and restart all implementation automatically?

[2015-07-31 07:29:41] CTtpollard: yes
[2015-07-31 07:30:03] kris_: and is the set up process the same?
[2015-07-31 07:30:27] CTtpollard: kris_ do you know what opera version?
[2015-07-31 07:30:35] CTtpollard: chromium or presto?
[2015-07-31 07:30:58] kris_: Opera 12.16 Build 1860 for Linux x86_64.
[2015-07-31 07:31:26] kris_: I set it up using

[2015-07-31 07:33:28] kris_: webdriver

[2015-07-31 07:59:50] smccarthy: haha yea.... I like AZ for the most part. The cost of living is amazing, and Vegas, Mexico, San Diego are all close enough for a weekend trip
[2015-07-31 07:59:58] WhereIsMySpoon: that sounds like a whole lot of bug waiting to happen
[2015-07-31 08:01:30] dude-x: Perl has a lot features where you can shoot yourself in the foot.
[2015-07-31 08:01:49] WhereIsMySpoon: \o/
[2015-07-31 08:01:54] kyoob: so like, rather than socking an open filehandle to a string within a method, you could just use the open filehandle passed in by referencing $_
[2015-07-31 08:02:18] WhereIsMySpoon: or you could be sure what you're referencing and use an actual variable name
[2015-07-31 08:02:27] WhereIsMySpoon: I could change all my variable names to be 'a', 'b', 'c'
[2015-07-31 08:02:29] WhereIsMySpoon: or 'banana'
[2015-07-31 08:02:38] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe it'd make for shorter code
[2015-07-31 08:03:13] kyoob: perl guys love shorter code
[2015-07-31 08:03:29] WhereIsMySpoon: shorter code doesnt mean better code
[2015-07-31 08:03:37] kyoob: hey now i didn't say that
[2015-07-31 08:03:46] WhereIsMySpoon: i didnt say you did
[2015-07-31 08:04:01] dude-x: but you can treat it like a souped up C or Python and avoid that. but people don't
[2015-07-31 08:04:06] kyoob: well i didn't say you said i said that
[2015-07-31 08:04:14] WhereIsMySpoon: kyoob: -_-
[2015-07-31 08:05:00] kyoob: i don't know what it is. there are lots of impossible to read perl programs out there that are only that way so someone could say their program fits on a post-it
[2015-07-31 08:05:45] kyoob: you could do the same with any language. but perl makes it easy and nasty
[2015-07-31 08:06:59] WhereIsMySpoon: i doubt you could do the same with java :p
[2015-07-31 08:08:55] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: you could if you had some FactoryFactoryFactory class

[2015-07-31 12:14:57] dude-x: kyoob: you mean it's slower than usual? :p
[2015-07-31 12:15:14] dude-x: i don't know the speed characteristics of our sauce tests to judge
[2015-07-31 12:16:07] yenaemj, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-31 12:16:58] kyoob: i mean i get failures on sauce that i don't get locally. i just wonder if the performance is the main issue
[2015-07-31 12:17:06] kyoob: does my application suck when performance is bad?
[2015-07-31 12:17:16] kyoob: or do my tests suck when performance is bad?
[2015-07-31 12:17:50] dude-x: so....
[2015-07-31 12:18:06] dude-x: if tests pass locally 99% of the time
[2015-07-31 12:18:17] dude-x: and they fail on sauce, or a remote workstation
[2015-07-31 12:18:22] dude-x: you have ... flaky tests.
[2015-07-31 12:18:58] dude-x: or a bug where speed of input can expose a race condition or something else that is subtle.
[2015-07-31 12:27:02] kyoob: superflaky
[2015-07-31 12:28:21] kyoob: we have tests that fail 20%-50% of the time without any change to the tests or the application. this project is a nightmare.
[2015-07-31 12:28:40] ato: lukeis: Why would you want anything other than Bing?
[2015-07-31 12:28:58] ato: lukeis: And Windows and Edge?
[2015-07-31 12:29:49] dude-x: kyoob: what language you write your tests in?
[2015-07-31 12:30:04] kyoob: dude-x: java
[2015-07-31 12:30:35] dude-x: oh bummer. Box.com has a python py.test plugin called flaky you can use to mark your tests as flaky
[2015-07-31 12:30:51] dude-x: i'm sure there's a junit or testng plugin that does the same (or you can write your own Rule)
[2015-07-31 12:31:34] kyoob: we run em thru teamcity, and that has pretty good reporting about which tests are problematic
[2015-07-31 12:31:46] kyoob: it's just whack-a-mole at the moment
[2015-07-31 12:33:56] yosito, quitting. ()
[2015-07-31 12:37:10] dude-x: well the fast easy fix is look at where the test fails
[2015-07-31 12:37:28] dude-x: add a Thread.sleep(2000) to the troublesome line.
[2015-07-31 12:37:29] kyoob: lol what's the hard fix?
[2015-07-31 12:37:33] kyoob: haha
[2015-07-31 12:37:58] dude-x: look at how the webpage is rendering, figure out what elements are mutating, and then wait on that element to change in some way
[2015-07-31 12:38:11] kyoob: my coworker just last week said "i fixed the video player tests" i went in there and there were sleeps before every findElement
[2015-07-31 12:38:37] kyoob: and the tests still flaked
[2015-07-31 12:38:42] dude-x: but you want to use a polling wait.
[2015-07-31 12:38:52] dude-x: which is WebDriverWait
[2015-07-31 12:39:18] dgempesaw, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-31 12:39:49] dude-x: Some actions are to wait for an intermediate element to be visible, or disappear, wait for an invisible element to match some state
[2015-07-31 12:40:40] dude-x: since you mentioned video stuff, it seems that you have a javascript heavy site. you may be able to use whatever framework the site uses to synchronize actions a little better.
[2015-07-31 12:41:30] kyoob: part of the problem is that the client-side stuff all works synchronously
[2015-07-31 12:41:59] kyoob: part X could become present before or after part Y depending on how much data is being served, performance, etc
[2015-07-31 12:43:23] kyoob: on a lot of pages in the app we've got listeners that create a [rendered] attribute on an element in the body once everything is done processing
[2015-07-31 12:43:25] kyoob: that helps
[2015-07-31 12:43:38] kyoob: but the video player is just our frame around brightcove's code
[2015-07-31 12:43:57] kyoob: not much we can do but wait for the timer to start ticking or whatever
[2015-07-31 12:44:14] kyoob: another part of the problem is the application is actually broken and the video just doesn't autoplay sometimes
[2015-07-31 12:44:17] dude-x: another option is to cheat with javascript and just set things in motion, or set values
[2015-07-31 12:44:19] kyoob: look, we've all got problms
[2015-07-31 12:45:31] kyoob: if i had my druthers we'd rewrite the whole thing from scratch
