[2015-07-20 00:17:40] katch: (newbie to selenium and ruby) hi, looking for help with input keys. Code is here https://gist.github.com/mrudulp/a21e0d124b1e4535ec6c. Issue is that test does not wait for input keys. I have tried some hacky way to wait for full page load as well, but it does not help. Before moving code to page object pattern same code used to work. Any idea what could be the issue

[2015-07-20 02:16:13] RahulAN: python
[2015-07-20 02:16:15] sgsabbage: use .text rather than .getText()

[2015-07-20 02:16:59] sgsabbage: note, I've not actually used the python bindings in about 2 years, so I am literally going off the documents :)

[2015-07-20 02:33:25] RahulAN: Actually there is <pre id="testResultsText"> Hello </pre>  i want the entire text (Hello) in one variable
[2015-07-20 02:33:43] RahulAN: between pre tag
[2015-07-20 02:34:29] Dave_B_: one_variable = browser.find_element_by_id('testResultsText').text

[2015-07-20 02:47:34] Dave_B_: basically the ones in it with brackets afterwards are methods, ones without are properties, so they're called by the format some_element.mehtod_name() or some_element.property
[2015-07-20 02:48:01] Dave_B_: browser.find_element_… is returning a webelement so effectively we're doing the above, just in a single chain

[2015-07-20 07:53:29] EdwardIII: ah
[2015-07-20 07:53:49] EdwardIII: it looks like it waits a full 1m before 'delete session'

[2015-07-20 07:54:38] EdwardIII: hrm
[2015-07-20 07:54:48] EdwardIII: that server is local (it's on a vm) but it is headless
[2015-07-20 07:55:03] EdwardIII: i can switch the vm to run with a head buuut i have a feeling installing & configuring X is going to be a big headache heh

[2015-07-20 08:12:52] EdwardIII: sgsabbage: yeah that's right
[2015-07-20 08:13:28] EdwardIII: here's the latest: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/fafa463f0f8424cc87e2

[2015-07-20 08:13:54] sgsabbage: comment it out and see what error you get - this is a problem I've seen before where the test fails, firing an exception, it gets to onNotSuccessfulTest, then something in there throws an exception, so you never actually see what caused the test to fail in the first place
[2015-07-20 08:14:02] EdwardIII: ahh
[2015-07-20 08:14:17] sgsabbage: or put a try/catch around the screenshot call

[2015-07-20 08:16:27] EdwardIII: haha
[2015-07-20 08:16:38] sgsabbage: jimevans: There are 13 competing bindings..
[2015-07-20 08:16:38] EdwardIII: https://xkcd.com/927/
[2015-07-20 08:16:51] sgsabbage: bah, I was off by one!
[2015-07-20 08:16:54] EdwardIII: he's like a thinking-man's dilbert
[2015-07-20 08:17:34] jimevans: sgsabbage: i'm well aware. the "not-invented-here syndrome" in the php webdriver community is only surpassed by that of the javascript community.
[2015-07-20 08:17:54] jimevans: i've publicly lamented the proliferation of multiple php bindings for years.
[2015-07-20 08:17:55] sgsabbage: oh, no, jimevans, I was quoting the XKCD that EdwardIII linked to
[2015-07-20 08:17:56] sgsabbage: :)
[2015-07-20 08:18:28] sgsabbage: but then he linked to it and exposed the fact that I got the number wrong
[2015-07-20 08:18:30] jimevans: AutomatedTester: yt?
[2015-07-20 08:18:36] AutomatedTester: jimevans: did you see the Javascript community now wants a browser automation tool for testing and scraping?
[2015-07-20 08:18:40] AutomatedTester: jimevans: no... :P
[2015-07-20 08:18:44] jimevans: yeah, i saw that one.
[2015-07-20 08:18:50] *jimevans sighs.'
[2015-07-20 08:18:56] AutomatedTester: and that WebDriver was "over engineered for their needs"
[2015-07-20 08:19:04] jimevans: wtfe.
[2015-07-20 08:19:31] *AutomatedTester waits silently for them to realise they are idiots'
[2015-07-20 08:19:44] jimevans: i don't remember where that came about though, what mailing list or public forum it was posted to.
[2015-07-20 08:19:51] BHS_error: hahah
[2015-07-20 08:20:05] sgsabbage: so, question - what do folks consider would be an actual beneficial thing I could do for the PHP webdriver community? Or is that a doomed question?
[2015-07-20 08:20:06] WhereIsMySpoon: webdriver was not engineered for scraping in the first place xD
[2015-07-20 08:20:18] AutomatedTester: https://github.com/maxogden/electron-microscope/issues/1
[2015-07-20 08:21:19] sgsabbage: (since I suspect it would start with: "get everyone behind the same implementation")
[2015-07-20 08:21:29] WhereIsMySpoon: scope.domReady(cb)
[2015-07-20 08:21:32] WhereIsMySpoon: hahahahahahahaha
[2015-07-20 08:21:52] WhereIsMySpoon: good luck mr naive
[2015-07-20 08:21:54] dude-x: WhereIsMySpoon: i saw a presentation where a business research company did use webdriver for scraping certain kinds of information
[2015-07-20 08:22:01] jimevans: sgsabbage: yep, that would be the first, most beneficial thing you could do, imo.
[2015-07-20 08:22:10] WhereIsMySpoon: dude-x: and I can use a donkey to haul carrots from the supermarket
[2015-07-20 08:22:33] dude-x: well their use case made sense, and it wasn't super sophisticated

[2015-07-20 08:23:02] sgsabbage: jimevans: Damn, I was hoping the answer was 'write my own implementation, insist it is the one true way, and die in obscurity'
[2015-07-20 08:23:02] WhereIsMySpoon: dude-x: sure, you can use it for that, but if you wanna to web scraping on a large scale webdriver is a bit slow for that
[2015-07-20 08:23:24] WhereIsMySpoon: sgsabbage: if you wanna become like the other 13 implementations, sure
[2015-07-20 08:23:25] p0deje, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-20 08:23:26] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-07-20 08:23:31] dude-x: true, but the advantage they had was to be able to obtain text that was hidden behind javascript controls
[2015-07-20 08:23:35] Dave_B_: I've sorta done scraping-ish things in that when testing deeplinks out from my own site I already had my own page model so recorded details of what we thought the deeplink was, then grabbed screenies on the other end and human-verified it matched… so the 'scraping' was of ourselves :p
[2015-07-20 08:23:37] EdwardIII: hrm ok so this is the underlying exception: PHPUnit_Extensions_Selenium2TestCase_NoSeleniumException: Error connection[28] to http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/session/3366f130-4275-47ab-acd7-b44529034eb6/element/40/click: Operation timed out after 60001 milliseconds with 0 bytes received
[2015-07-20 08:23:39] jimevans: i used webdriver last month to bulk-download a bunch of data from a site we were migrating from that (stupidly) didn't provide an api for accessing your data.
[2015-07-20 08:24:26] jimevans: don't even care that i was violating ToS of the site. they weren't responding to our needs, so we downloaded our data and closed our account with them.

[2015-07-20 08:28:12] WhereIsMySpoon: i am suspicious..
[2015-07-20 08:28:21] EdwardIII: i mean it waited 60001ms
[2015-07-20 08:28:23] sgsabbage: bear in mind that 60 second timeout is a curl timeout
[2015-07-20 08:28:27] sgsabbage: I believe
[2015-07-20 08:28:28] EdwardIII: oh
[2015-07-20 08:28:36] EdwardIII: i'm going to pepper in some more waitUntils
[2015-07-20 08:28:36] WhereIsMySpoon: whats that got to do with anything
[2015-07-20 08:29:00] EdwardIII: this is the line: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/fafa463f0f8424cc87e2#file-f-php-L69
[2015-07-20 08:29:08] EdwardIII: but it only happens on the second test (ideal)
[2015-07-20 08:29:16] EdwardIII: which is strange. i'd expect it to be broken on both
[2015-07-20 08:30:02] sgsabbage: WhereIsMySpoon: the server isn't responding with any data, so after 60 seconds curl aborts and throws a CurlTimeoutException
[2015-07-20 08:30:28] sgsabbage: which is why it says it waiting 60001ms
[2015-07-20 08:30:29] EdwardIII: it did look a bit like it had triggered a JS animation then tried to click a button being hidden BEFORE the animation had completed (POSSIBLY)
[2015-07-20 08:30:40] WhereIsMySpoon: sgsabbage: selenium uses curl?
[2015-07-20 08:30:41] EdwardIII: but i'd expect the server to throw an elementnotfoundexception
[2015-07-20 08:30:44] EdwardIII: rather than just break

[2015-07-20 08:35:45] EdwardIII: the musical genre?
[2015-07-20 08:35:48] WhereIsMySpoon: yus
[2015-07-20 08:36:10] sgsabbage: I never got into bluegrass, but I think that was a teen rebellion thing against my parents
[2015-07-20 08:36:18] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2015-07-20 08:36:21] WhereIsMySpoon: fair enough
[2015-07-20 08:36:25] WhereIsMySpoon: its really upbeat and happy
[2015-07-20 08:36:29] sgsabbage: I was a fairly well behaved teenager, so instead I just disliked their music
[2015-07-20 08:36:47] WhereIsMySpoon: its hard to find non religious bluegrass though
[2015-07-20 08:37:00] WhereIsMySpoon: been listening to "newgrass" and progressive bluegrass which seems to be more secular

[2015-07-20 08:40:20] WhereIsMySpoon: nice
[2015-07-20 08:40:41] WhereIsMySpoon: i love to sing...never done it professionally though, just did my grade 8 and a couple competitions
[2015-07-20 08:41:10] sgsabbage: ABRSM?

[2015-07-20 08:43:40] sgsabbage: I was studying for my grade 5 violin this time last year until I had a bit of a 'too many things' breakdown and had to drop something
[2015-07-20 08:44:14] WhereIsMySpoon: sgsabbage: oh nice..I got to grade 2 piano and couldnt get further...different rhythms in both hands is hard
[2015-07-20 08:44:26] WhereIsMySpoon: well hellecasters is nothing like bluegrass lol
[2015-07-20 08:44:38] sgsabbage: WhereIsMySpoon: I am awful at genre spotting
[2015-07-20 08:45:56] WhereIsMySpoon: sgsabbage: bluegrass is fairly fast tempo, usually with banjos and a dude with a texan/georgian/southern redneck accent
[2015-07-20 08:46:07] sgsabbage: aha
[2015-07-20 08:46:19] sgsabbage: and I would love to play piano but time, money and lack of space for another musical instrument

[2015-07-20 08:52:46] jimevans: oh! visual studio 2015 releases today.
[2015-07-20 08:53:03] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: also additionally, vs 2015 contains resources for developing on ios/android
[2015-07-20 08:53:31] WhereIsMySpoon: as in you can build the apps using vs 2015
[2015-07-20 08:53:59] WhereIsMySpoon: sgsabbage: well there's a whole lotta bluegrass out there but np :)

[2015-07-20 08:59:29] EdwardIII: hrm ok so
[2015-07-20 08:59:40] EdwardIII: the button, weirdly, doesn't render in my test
[2015-07-20 08:59:56] EdwardIII: but why does it curl timeout?
[2015-07-20 08:59:58] EdwardIII: and not show 'elementnotfound' ex?
[2015-07-20 09:00:23] WhereIsMySpoon: i might hazard a guess that its there to the dom inspector but when it actually tries to do the click it doesnt work because it isnt rendered
[2015-07-20 09:00:53] WhereIsMySpoon: *wonders if this could all be avoided by not using phantomjs*
[2015-07-20 09:01:48] EdwardIII: hrm yeah but why isn't it rendering
[2015-07-20 09:02:00] sgsabbage: on that note, home time!

[2015-07-20 09:02:15] WhereIsMySpoon: (:
[2015-07-20 09:02:19] EdwardIII: and why, only, when it runs the second test?
[2015-07-20 09:02:25] EdwardIII: maybe i should just have 2 totally separate testcases?
[2015-07-20 09:02:36] WhereIsMySpoon: anythiings worth a go at this point
[2015-07-20 09:03:03] sgsabbage: EdwardIII: If you filter it, phpunit --filter Ideal does it still fail?
[2015-07-20 09:03:14] sgsabbage: so that it only runs one test

[2015-07-20 09:08:50] WhereIsMySpoon: EdwardIII: did you try removing parts of the testcase bit by bit?

[2015-07-20 09:10:28] WhereIsMySpoon: what?..
[2015-07-20 09:10:38] EdwardIII: the real test case is, under testing conditions, actually redirecting you away to a payment provider
[2015-07-20 09:11:33] EdwardIII: but why selenium is fouling up like that rather than taking a screenshot and then showing the next page i don't know

[2015-07-20 09:45:47] simonstewart: Guess I should do the work in the java tree asap

[2015-07-20 09:46:37] simonstewart: Aye
[2015-07-20 09:46:48] lukeis: on another note… god damn simonstewart how did you figure out most of that stuff in the firefox driver…. navigating the mozilla docs for extensions and then 'testing out things' is quite painful in my experience with trying to implement the basic auth.

[2015-07-20 12:53:25] jimevans: the driver doesn't set that preference automatically? seems like it ought to.
[2015-07-20 12:54:08] chromehelp: I got the browser to open a link in a new tab but i need to switch to it.

[2015-07-20 13:11:33] jimevans: chromehelp: let's try a slightly different approach. what, specifically, isn't working? i assume you want to switch to the new window for some purpose, and whatever you're trying to do on the new window is failing?
[2015-07-20 13:11:44] dude-x: chromehelp: the code should be something like current_window_handle = driver.get_current_window_handle; for handles in driver.get_handles: if handle != current_window handle, then switch to window handle
[2015-07-20 13:14:59] chromehelp: I'm using tabs and i want to switch to the tab. switch to window isnt working
[2015-07-20 13:15:30] lukeis: a 'tab' is just a 'window'

[2015-07-20 13:16:48] lukeis: the browser will not visibly show you the tab switched to
[2015-07-20 13:17:02] lukeis: your webdriver context can control a window hidden by others
[2015-07-20 13:17:06] jimevans: remember that "switch_to_window" switches the *driver's* focus to the new tab/window. the driver will do nothing to actually switch the operating system focus.
[2015-07-20 13:17:21] jimevans: y'know what? i'm gonna butt out of this one.
[2015-07-20 13:20:04] chromehelp: if that's true then that means i should still be able to 'switch windows', do stuff, then close that tab

Firefox does not consider the window to be 'modal' nsIWebBrowserChrome.isWindowModal returns false, what other mechanism may exist to detect it?" :)
[2015-07-20 13:47:40] lukeis: i'm currently crawling through firefox source code to figure it out....
[2015-07-20 13:47:51] AutomatedTester: um... one sec
[2015-07-20 13:50:02] AutomatedTester: iirc Marionette supports it

[2015-07-20 13:56:17] AutomatedTester: lukeis: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/marionette/driver.js#2728 is how we use that dialog

[2015-07-20 22:25:10] lukeis: :note AutomatedTester thanks for the pointers earlier, I've made tons of progress because of it and am refactoring a bunch of the current firefox driver regarding alerts. One thing I noticed is that in the marionette code, you guys aren't handling the case of when a user manually 'handles' the dialog. One thing I've stumbled across is this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIWindowWatcher#
[2015-07-20 22:25:47] lukeis: :note AutomatedTester when you check the activeWindow, it returns null when a modal (like alert) is displayed
