[2015-07-17 03:05:48] EdwardIII: hrm ok it seems to have a method for ->currentScreenshot
[2015-07-17 03:05:53] EdwardIII: the PHP implementation
[2015-07-17 03:06:32] sgsabbage: yeah, the $captureScreenshotOnFailure is all convenience stuff, but at the end of the day it just calls /session/:sessionId/screenshot
[2015-07-17 03:06:43] sgsabbage: which returns a base64 encoded screenshot
[2015-07-17 03:07:36] EdwardIII: ah ok
[2015-07-17 03:07:39] EdwardIII: convenience stuff which doesn't work heh

[2015-07-17 03:11:28] EdwardIII: heh
[2015-07-17 03:11:34] EdwardIII: the most basic thing imaginable
[2015-07-17 03:11:44] EdwardIII: they didn't even have it until relatively recently
[2015-07-17 03:11:45] sgsabbage: EdwardIII, what does $this->currentScreenshot() get you?
[2015-07-17 03:12:04] EdwardIII: i guess it's kinda hard to implement into a language retrospectively
[2015-07-17 03:12:06] BHS_error: EdwardIII: they chose the less ambiguous character for the namespacing, hence '\'
[2015-07-17 03:12:17] sgsabbage: (it'll be raw data, but it should return something)
[2015-07-17 03:12:33] EdwardIII: heh yes which was a good move, because \ doesn't already have a meaning in every single language in and every single environment everywhere...
[2015-07-17 03:12:45] EdwardIII: lemme give it a spin sgsabbage

[2015-07-17 03:13:50] sgsabbage: WhereIsMySpoon that would have been a good separator
[2015-07-17 03:13:54] WhereIsMySpoon: why did they not use ::

[2015-07-17 03:14:44] sgsabbage: I will readily admit I have worked in PHP professionally all of my adult life
[2015-07-17 03:14:50] EdwardIII: gooooood onnnneeee guyyyyys heh
[2015-07-17 03:14:50] sgsabbage: and I still despair at it
[2015-07-17 03:14:57] BHS_error: WhereIsMySpoon: dunno, it was ambiguous I think
[2015-07-17 03:15:21] EdwardIII: i couldn't do any better of course
[2015-07-17 03:16:10] sgsabbage: When it was originally written by Rasmus, the hash function for function names was the length of the function name, so that's why there most of the core functions are inconsistently named

[2015-07-17 03:17:43] EdwardIII: sgsabbage: yes, ->screenshot() does return a screenshot
[2015-07-17 03:17:51] EdwardIII: well, a bunch of base64 encoded text i assume is a screenshot

[2015-07-17 03:18:00] EdwardIII: so i guess it's the "dump screenshot on error" bit that's the problem
[2015-07-17 03:18:24] WhereIsMySpoon: um
[2015-07-17 03:18:25] EdwardIII: i *think* captureScreenshotOnFailure didn't make it into their selenium2 implementation
[2015-07-17 03:18:27] WhereIsMySpoon: class foo {
[2015-07-17 03:18:27] WhereIsMySpoon:     static function bar(){echo "bar\n";
[2015-07-17 03:18:27] WhereIsMySpoon: }
[2015-07-17 03:18:33] WhereIsMySpoon: that seems like a syntax error
[2015-07-17 03:18:50] BHS_error: haha even in the examples they can't get it right damn it
[2015-07-17 03:18:51] sgsabbage: EdwardIII: You can just use onNotSuccessfulTest( \Exception $e ){} to catch failing tests
[2015-07-17 03:19:19] sgsabbage: it's a callback that'll get called by PHPUnit if/when your tests fail (or are skipped)
[2015-07-17 03:19:25] EdwardIII: mmmi can can i? just override that method on my testcase?
[2015-07-17 03:19:36] sgsabbage: yup, just make sure you throw $e at the end of it
[2015-07-17 03:19:43] EdwardIII: sweet, thanks
[2015-07-17 03:19:48] sgsabbage: or call parent::onNot.. etc

[2015-07-17 03:20:50] BHS_error: onFailedTest would have been better nah ?
[2015-07-17 03:21:04] sgsabbage: yes, except that it also is called in the case of a skipped or incomplete test
[2015-07-17 03:21:25] BHS_error: yeah I was just thinking about that :)
[2015-07-17 03:21:28] sgsabbage: Or, even onUnsuccessfulTest
[2015-07-17 03:21:37] sgsabbage: which sounds better in my head
[2015-07-17 03:22:04] sgsabbage: I don't actually use Selenium2TestCase, I wrote my own - yes I know, yet another implementation
[2015-07-17 03:22:17] BHS_error: I'm not judging
[2015-07-17 03:22:30] sgsabbage: well - I use a selenium implementation in it
[2015-07-17 03:22:35] sgsabbage: which wasn't written by me
[2015-07-17 03:22:36] sgsabbage: :D
[2015-07-17 03:23:21] BHS_error: I'm the co-maintainer of the main Perl implementation of the Selenium bindings

[2015-07-17 03:24:12] WhereIsMySpoon: BHS_error: because perl
[2015-07-17 03:24:14] WhereIsMySpoon: :P
[2015-07-17 03:24:21] BHS_error: haha
[2015-07-17 03:24:33] EdwardIII: perl is awesome
[2015-07-17 03:24:47] BHS_error: at least we don't use \ as separators for the namespaces :)
[2015-07-17 03:24:52] EdwardIII: cpan Literally::Anything::You::Could::Ever::Imagine # some scaffolding, take the rest of the day off
[2015-07-17 03:25:11] EdwardIII: in #perl they say PHP is a lobotomised perl
[2015-07-17 03:25:21] EdwardIII: which stands up pretty well
[2015-07-17 03:25:50] BHS_error: yeah Rasmus got all his inspiration from Perl to craft PHP
[2015-07-17 03:26:06] EdwardIII: perl is insanely idiomatic, and yes, there is some foul code out there, but i've seen some really beautiful code in perl
[2015-07-17 03:26:31] EdwardIII: imo it's biggest problem is when you google "how to do this in perl" you get some horrid CGI article from 1995
[2015-07-17 03:27:31] BHS_error: EdwardIII: like in PHP, I think you look for anything you'll end up with some shitty example
[2015-07-17 03:27:40] sgsabbage: PHP just makes it easy
[2015-07-17 03:27:53] EdwardIII: hmm but in PHP it never ends
[2015-07-17 03:28:05] EdwardIII: nobody is using CGI.pm anymore, but lots and lots of people are still doing mysql_query on fresh projects
[2015-07-17 03:28:16] sgsabbage: It has taken me an hour, but I have finally added a new package to my Visual Studio solution

[2015-07-17 03:29:10] sgsabbage: It necessitated: Figuring out where all my disk space had gone (20GB parallels log file), updating Visual Studio so that it wouldn't crash, uninstalling the NuGet package manager, reinstalling the package manager..
[2015-07-17 03:29:25] WhereIsMySpoon: sgsabbage: O.o such log file

[2015-07-17 03:30:21] sgsabbage: EdwardIII: Hm, I'm not sure when they call tearDown and onNotSuccessful in the order
[2015-07-17 03:30:30] EdwardIII: using a teenie weenie SSD drive like me?
[2015-07-17 03:31:07] EdwardIII: sgsabbage: i kinda imagine there's already be some mechanism in place for capturing screenshots on exception though heh
[2015-07-17 03:31:48] EdwardIII: hrm maybe not, i don't see a unit test for that
[2015-07-17 03:33:11] sgsabbage: try taking the stop() out of tearDown, it should handle that
[2015-07-17 03:33:42] sgsabbage: (he says, and is probably wrong)

[2015-07-17 07:15:23] BHS_error: that was the main requirement right ?

[2015-07-17 07:54:40] jexmex: so I have a scraper I wrote with scrapy that uses selenium with the phantomjs webdriver to process dynamically injection html.

[2015-07-17 07:55:37] jexmex: this is a basic find_elements_by_css_selector search, using pretty pointed searches (for example .rc-item .rc-item-wrapper)
[2015-07-17 07:55:38] Sudhansu, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-17 07:57:00] Dave_B_: Massive page? Gotta check all class names on all elements with those selectors so not the fastest but shouldn't be 20s anyway
[2015-07-17 07:57:42] Dave_B_: I presume local phantomjs so no communication time problems, no implicit waits set etc
[2015-07-17 07:58:15] jexmex: yes local phantom
[2015-07-17 07:58:26] Dave_B_: I've limited phantomjs experience but it was often much slower than e.g. firefox in a virtual frame buffer - maybe worth a go to see if that makes much difference
[2015-07-17 07:58:27] jexmex: I have implicit waits, maybe that is the issue

[2015-07-17 07:58:37] jexmex: I wanted to make sure the page was loaded before proceeding
[2015-07-17 07:58:56] Dave_B_: implicit waits with find_elements is a bit weird so may be causing issues with the phantomjs driver
[2015-07-17 07:59:11] jexmex: ok I will try removing them and go from there, thank you very much
[2015-07-17 07:59:16] Dave_B_: hope it helps

[2015-07-17 08:00:16] Dave_B_: implicit waits in general i don't like (explict or go home :p) but at least on find_element it's clear what it's waiting for. On find_elements I've no idea what it would even choose to wait for :/
[2015-07-17 08:00:38] jexmex: ya that seemed to speed it up, let me see if it causes issues with finding things though
[2015-07-17 08:01:20] jexmex: I had it setup with driver (driver.implicitly_wait(20), which I did not realize would happen everytime

[2015-07-17 08:12:27] jexmex: interesting, you know I spent 2 1/2 days trying different things to make the iframe switching worked (while putting it on the back burner a few times to move onto other things)
[2015-07-17 08:12:45] WhereIsMySpoon: x_x
[2015-07-17 08:13:22] jexmex: yes, a would be a single result of the find_by_elements. I add the wait, then the switch after

[2015-07-17 08:15:37] Dave_B_: also are you in the right frame when you're starting this lookup? (ps if it's an id you can just do find_by_css('#my_id')or do find_by_id('my_id'))
[2015-07-17 08:15:43] jexmex: yes it is, the gv_id would end up something like blah-7475, there maybe multiple of blah-* but each number is unique

[2015-07-17 08:31:22] WhereIsMySpoon: BHS_error: oh so it does
[2015-07-17 08:31:28] WhereIsMySpoon: BHS_error: you should try not to use xpath
[2015-07-17 08:31:32] WhereIsMySpoon: css selectors are much better
[2015-07-17 08:32:00] BHS_error: why so ?
[2015-07-17 08:32:13] WhereIsMySpoon: BHS_error: theyre faster for a start

[2015-07-17 08:33:41] BHS_error: WhereIsMySpoon: from my point of view, I found xpaths easier to write than css selectors
[2015-07-17 08:34:05] BHS_error: I mean, once you get the logic, it really make more sense than css selectors
[2015-07-17 08:34:14] WhereIsMySpoon: "more sense"?

[2015-07-17 08:40:46] sgsabbage: XPath makes perfect sense when your DOM is only about data - but because the DOM in the majority of websites is more of a presentation layer than a data layer, it rapidly breaks down

[2015-07-17 16:23:11] sevaseva: Hm, that was too general.. more specifically, there was not a decision made to drop the notion of the page loading strategies (none, normal, eager) despite Simon's comment https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20947#c1 , right?

[2015-07-17 16:26:51] AutomatedTester: sevaseva: So I am inclined to go with  that comment because it would simplify things and we already tell users to do explicit waits
[2015-07-17 16:27:32] AutomatedTester: sevaseva: but feel free to throw it to the mailing list. Sam's comment doesnt go to the mailing list
[2015-07-17 16:29:21] sevaseva: AutomatedTester: thanks. as an immediate answer I get that a decision is not made on that bug, that's helpful to clarify but sad :)
[2015-07-17 16:30:34] sevaseva: I had a feeling that say marionette implemented page load strategies (and probably Microsoft too, because current spec - updated after that Simon's comment - says all about page loading strategies)
[2015-07-17 16:31:24] sevaseva: anyway. we will consider that undecided for now
[2015-07-17 16:32:33] AutomatedTester: we dont have page load strategy implemented yet
