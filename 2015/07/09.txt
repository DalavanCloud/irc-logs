[2015-07-09 02:07:49] Vlissides: Hello, I am having a problem with phantomjs driver, I try to find an element by xpath, it works correctly with firefox driver, but not with phantomjs and neither with chrome driver
[2015-07-09 02:07:59] Vlissides: have you faced similar problems?
[2015-07-09 02:09:02] Dave_B_: in general xpath is not desirable, use css selectors. Also, phantomjs is generally not appropriate for testing as no sutomers use it (though chrome is of course!)
[2015-07-09 02:09:26] Dave_B_: for specific help though it'd be good if we could see the website you're looking at & the selector you're using
[2015-07-09 02:10:21] ralku: Is the XPath actually valid in both Firefox and Chrome?
[2015-07-09 02:10:26] Dave_B_: (xpath has occasional uses, I'm not telling you to never use it or anything)
[2015-07-09 02:10:32] Dave_B_: good question ^ :)
[2015-07-09 02:11:26] ralku: Vlissides I often experience minor differences in the DOM between FF and Webkit-based
[2015-07-09 02:12:13] ralku: just forgot what the Google Webkit fork is called now haha crap
[2015-07-09 02:12:31] Vlissides: I've seen in chrome it has double quotes instead of single quotes that it had in firefox, but i don't know how this works, they are different in each browser?
[2015-07-09 02:12:51] Dave_B_: yes, browsers are different, this is why cross-browser testing is a thing!
[2015-07-09 02:14:36] ralku: Yeah, well just 'cause there are webdrivers for many browsers doesn't mean that the DOM-Structure is the same ;) that's where we need to find the right balance between being specific and ambiguity
[2015-07-09 02:15:45] ralku: But Vlissides the interesting Question would be: If you get the absolute XPath for the Element in Chrome and FF, are they identiclal?
[2015-07-09 02:16:05] Dave_B_: this is part of why I like a good css selector - people often grab very overly specific xpaths (I realise they could do this with css selectors too) and it makes stuff super fragile
[2015-07-09 02:16:26] ralku, changing nick to ralku[away].
[2015-07-09 02:17:44] Vlissides: ralku: identical, but in chrome with double quotes .//*[@id="header"]/a[2] and in firefox with single .//*[@id='header']/a[2]
[2015-07-09 02:18:46] ralku[away], changing nick to ralku.
[2015-07-09 02:19:49] ralku: okay... don't think that'll be the problem...
[2015-07-09 02:20:25] Dave_B_: is the error a NoSuchElementException ?
[2015-07-09 02:20:36] Dave_B_: and is this element present from first page load?
[2015-07-09 02:20:49] Vlissides: Dave_B: no, it is selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotVisibleException
[2015-07-09 02:20:55] Dave_B_: Ah
[2015-07-09 02:20:59] ralku: okay ^^
[2015-07-09 02:21:13] Dave_B_: so FF & Chrome handle transparent elements differently
[2015-07-09 02:21:17] fabrice31, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-07-09 02:21:26] ralku: doesn't even have to be that way!

[2015-07-09 02:21:43] fabrice31, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-09 02:21:47] Dave_B_: if an element is transparent and in front of something you try and interact with then FF interacts anyway, Chrome tells you it can't cause it's not visible
[2015-07-09 02:21:51] ralku: is the element you're accessing only made visible by another action?
[2015-07-09 02:22:01] Dave_B_: (Could be other things than transparency but it's a place to start)
[2015-07-09 02:22:03] Vlissides: yes
[2015-07-09 02:22:15] Vlissides: it is a menu, which appears after a click
[2015-07-09 02:22:26] ralku: well... Chromedriver is faster than FF in my experience
[2015-07-09 02:22:27] Dave_B_: :D ralku wins
[2015-07-09 02:22:50] ralku: I had these cases, where FF just was slower, and got the AJAX timing
[2015-07-09 02:22:54] Dave_B_: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp#explicit-waits
[2015-07-09 02:23:48] Vlissides: ok, i'll try with explicit wait
[2015-07-09 02:24:11] ralku: :) try it! I'll stick around here... would be interesting to hear, if that was the problem
[2015-07-09 02:26:26] Vlissides: wow, works like a charm
[2015-07-09 02:26:33] Vlissides: thanks!
[2015-07-09 02:26:53] WhereIsMySpoon: Vlissides: in general when you're doing stuff like clicking on things and expecting something to happen, you should put an explicit wait
[2015-07-09 02:27:02] p0deje, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-09 02:27:59] Vlissides: WhereIsMySpoon: yes I understand it now
[2015-07-09 02:28:15] WhereIsMySpoon: good good
[2015-07-09 02:29:00] ralku: Vlissides Yep! If there's AJAX involved, you're Tests are gonna be Waiters ;)
[2015-07-09 02:30:12] Dave_B_: You've moved straight in to explicit waits which is good, being clear about what you're waiting for makes better sense and is more robust. Some code examples will have implicit waits, I'd try to avoid them as they're a pain for reliability, cross-browser compatibility & debugging
[2015-07-09 02:30:35] WhereIsMySpoon: explicit and fluent waits are the way to go
[2015-07-09 02:30:41] WhereIsMySpoon: :)

[2015-07-09 05:47:28] jimevans: okay, people, riddle me this. in the webdriver cookie tests, there's a test that navigates to a page over https so it can set and retrieve a cookie with the "secure" flag set. in the CI runs for the project, the IE 10 version of that test fails, but all other versions of IE pass. for IE 10, the browser is hitting IE's "untrusted SSL certificate" page, so it can't set the cookie. but why only for IE10?
[2015-07-09 05:48:15] Dave_B_: :op
[2015-07-09 05:48:38] Dave_B_: erm, normally I'd say 'wait for jim evans, he'll probably know' but in this case the answer seems inappropriate

[2015-07-09 09:13:14] dyce: does selenium clear cache/cookies on startup?
[2015-07-09 09:13:22] dyce: when running through python
[2015-07-09 09:13:32] barancev: lukeis: is the amount of Selenium mentions on http://www.wedoqa.com/ enough to be listed on the Selenium site?
[2015-07-09 09:14:25] jimevans: dyce: ti depends.
[2015-07-09 09:14:35] jimevans: what browser are you talking about?
[2015-07-09 09:14:39] dyce: firefox
[2015-07-09 09:14:42] lukeis: barancev: i supposeâ€¦ i just don't like providing "free advertising" :)
[2015-07-09 09:15:18] barancev: right, that's what we do
[2015-07-09 09:15:21] jimevans: dyce: firefox *should* be starting up with a clean user profile every time the browser launches, which would include cookies and cached pages, if memory serves.
[2015-07-09 09:16:01] barancev: but it makes sense to advertise companies that are really involved in Selenium movement
[2015-07-09 09:16:33] dyce: i see
[2015-07-09 09:16:45] lukeis:  Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ that made sense when selenium was trying to gain market share? I think we aren't trying to 'market' selenium much anymore
[2015-07-09 09:16:52] dyce: has anyone tried sikuli with selenium?

[2015-07-09 09:17:28] lukeis: if you aren't specifying a firefox profile, a new one will be usedâ€¦. the profile contains cookies and history, etc.
[2015-07-09 09:17:30] jimevans: and of course, i'm talking about selenium webdriver, not selenium rc

[2015-07-09 10:26:58] jimevans: in the tests i'm running, i know what browser and version it's running against, and i can either abort/ignore the test.

[2015-07-09 10:27:35] jimevans: i mean, i could try some hack like using javascript to "click" the "continue to this website" link, but that's lame.
[2015-07-09 10:27:57] octomeow: I had to invent that kind of dirty hack for our site :|
[2015-07-09 10:28:18] jimevans: i hate that IE doesn't give you any way around it. firefox and chrome both do.
[2015-07-09 10:28:23] octomeow: sometimes it has the popup about free access, and people in our office just love to toggle on free access on our IP address
[2015-07-09 10:28:29] jimevans: and when i say that, i mean the browser, not the driver.
