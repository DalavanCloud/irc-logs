[2015-07-11 03:29:16] Iceman_: Hello everyone
[2015-07-11 03:30:43] Iceman_: I'm facing the following problem : using nodejs selenium webdriver, trageting chromium on Debian, I can write something that opens the browser correctly on a given url
[2015-07-11 03:31:57] Iceman_: But since I rewrite the same stuff in a mocha cotext for tests, the browser opens with the "url": "data:," and I got stuck with a timeout exception from mocha
[2015-07-11 03:33:02] Iceman_: I found lightely similar issues on the web, but in very different environmenets (windows, protractorn etc..) and no clear solutions or explanations
[2015-07-11 03:33:57] Iceman_: Any help or ideas, please ? Best regards
[2015-07-11 03:37:49] Iceman_: (debian 8, node v0.12.4, selenium-webdriver 2.46.1, 2.2.5, chromium 43.0.2357.65)
[2015-07-11 03:38:03] Iceman_: mocha 2.2.5 sorry
