[2015-07-22 07:04:52] jimevans: sgsabbage: yep. unlike java, everything in c# is descended from System.Object, and has the concept of "value types" and "reference types". the "value types" you're used to seeing as scalar values are usually really structs. :)
[2015-07-22 07:05:21] sgsabbage: Ahhhh
[2015-07-22 07:05:46] sgsabbage: I didn't realise that, I was still thinking in very Java terms of primatives, etc
[2015-07-22 07:06:26] sircapsalot: i think c# still has primitives
[2015-07-22 07:06:27] jimevans: yeah, in c#, there's no distinction between 'int' and 'System.Int32'. the former is an alias for the latter.
[2015-07-22 07:06:35] sgsabbage: Indeed, if I actually pay attention to IntelliSense, int shows up as struct System.Int32

[2015-07-22 07:47:33] LocusAsaf: I'm wondering about best practices about handling TimeoutExceptions or ElementNotFoundExceptions, ETCExceptions that would be raised from a navigation or page object method?
[2015-07-22 07:47:54] LocusAsaf: do you let the exception just be raised or do you try and catch it in your test and handle appropriately?
[2015-07-22 07:48:37] sircapsalot: depends on what you want to do
[2015-07-22 07:48:41] sircapsalot: it's all subjective
[2015-07-22 07:49:12] sircapsalot: for example, if you get a timeout exception, you may want to send an email or file a bug that says "the app is too slow"  .. that's just an example ;)
[2015-07-22 07:49:48] fabrice31, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-22 07:50:52] sircapsalot: and for the ElementNotFound exception, i think it's useful to do something like: if (ElementNotFoundException) { tryAgain() }  to make sure you catch the ajax'y stuff

[2015-07-22 08:03:07] LocusAsaf: WhereIsMySpoon: I'm just double checking that it's okay that not all tests fail inside your actual test from an assertion

[2015-07-22 09:06:41] simonstewart: Nice to know it's working on your machine as well. You're the second person to build selenium on Windows using Buck
[2015-07-22 09:06:42] simonstewart: :)
[2015-07-22 09:06:49] jimevans: :D

[2015-07-22 09:11:01] simonstewart: On Linux we've got the "super console" that does ansi shit to make the display lovely and concise. Guessing we can't do that on Windows
[2015-07-22 09:11:11] simonstewart: Hi Millhouse
[2015-07-22 09:11:20] jimevans: simonstewart: okay, first bit is the buck.bat. i'm working on that right now.
[2015-07-22 09:11:26] simonstewart: Sweet :)
[2015-07-22 09:11:34] simonstewart: Also, thank you
[2015-07-22 09:11:52] jimevans: might be able to enable ansi stuff in the windows console. i'll investigate.

[2015-07-22 09:12:15] simonstewart: yeah. and .net
[2015-07-22 09:12:52] jimevans: for selenium, doing c++ in VS is simply invoking msbuild with the .cxproj file name.
[2015-07-22 09:13:06] jimevans: the c# compiling is far more comples.
[2015-07-22 09:13:09] simonstewart: jimevans: I'd like buck to do better in the long run :)
[2015-07-22 09:13:12] jimevans: and complex too.
[2015-07-22 09:13:43] jimevans: well, for selenium's purposes, i'm not sure i want to be calling cl.exe, then link.exe at the end.
[2015-07-22 09:13:50] jimevans: not at first, anyway.
[2015-07-22 09:14:25] jimevans: because to work in visual studio, that means you need to define all of your dependencies twice. in c#, it's not that bad.

[2015-07-22 09:32:51] BW^-: lukeis: manually closed I think!
[2015-07-22 09:32:55] BW^-: i closed it manually
[2015-07-22 09:33:01] BW^-: lukeis: even so Webdriver keeps stuck about it
[2015-07-22 09:33:01] lukeis: ok, that makes sense then

[2015-07-22 09:33:15] BW^-: lukeis: am I not allowed to close confirm:s and alert:s in Firefox 31.4.0 ESR?
[2015-07-22 09:33:37] lukeis: you can… usually you do it with an API call to accept or dismiss :)
[2015-07-22 09:34:05] lukeis: otherwise, expected the unexpected alert open exception message on the next wire call :)
[2015-07-22 09:34:12] BW^-: =)

[2015-07-22 09:59:49] WhereIsMySpoon: wait nvm
[2015-07-22 09:59:55] WhereIsMySpoon: ada maybe
[2015-07-22 09:59:59] BW^-: lukeis: my situation is that I already got the alert box

[2015-07-22 10:00:13] BW^-: lukeis: so all i want to do is just to make WebDriver think that it dismissed it
[2015-07-22 10:00:19] BW^-: lukeis: so, what about the step *after* the wait?
[2015-07-22 10:00:28] BW^-: lukeis: the actual "switching" to the alert box (even if it's gone) and "dismissing it"?
[2015-07-22 10:00:55] WhereIsMySpoon: BW^-: if its gone you cant do that
[2015-07-22 10:01:01] lukeis: if you are not manually messing with the alert box…. then you have a timing issue
[2015-07-22 10:01:17] BW^-: WehereIsMySpoon: aha, so i'm "trapped", and must restart my browser?
[2015-07-22 10:01:19] lukeis: remember selenium is "faster than a human could possible do"
[2015-07-22 10:01:27] BW^-: lukeis: right

[2015-07-22 10:01:39] simonstewart: I bet he's faster than selenium
[2015-07-22 10:01:41] BW^-: i mean it's not worse than that

[2015-07-22 10:02:18] sircapsalot: wouldn't that be a twist… you show up at SeConf.. a computer is sitting on the ground with his nametag
[2015-07-22 10:02:21] lukeis: simonstewart: how's that popcorn?
[2015-07-22 10:02:23] BW^-: WhereIsMySpoon: wait let me check if I can go to another URL..

[2015-07-22 10:02:58] BW^-: WhereIsMySpoon: no no, i was just surfing the web when *not* using webdriver
[2015-07-22 10:03:12] WhereIsMySpoon: ???????????

[2015-07-22 10:28:45] mekhami: hi folks. I really don't understand how travis integrates with grid tests (specifically with browser tests, but..) how does travis expose a url for the application?
[2015-07-22 10:29:21] lukeis: travis? selenium doesn't run the grid tests (really at all, anywhere...)
[2015-07-22 10:29:34] lukeis: it's a big coverage gap in our CI
[2015-07-22 10:29:44] mekhami: wait hold on
[2015-07-22 10:29:48] mekhami: i have selenium tests
[2015-07-22 10:29:55] mekhami: i have a platform that uses travis
[2015-07-22 10:30:01] mekhami: i just want the travis build system to include the selenium tests
[2015-07-22 10:30:03] mekhami: does that not work?!
[2015-07-22 10:30:04] lukeis: so you're talking about your tests?
[2015-07-22 10:30:07] mekhami: yeah
[2015-07-22 10:30:22] sjmikem, quitting. (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[2015-07-22 10:30:47] lukeis: then just add a the command you would use locally to run the tests command line to the .travis.yml ?
[2015-07-22 10:31:08] mekhami: right but what url do my tests hit?
[2015-07-22 10:31:11] lukeis: travis doesn't 'expose' a url, you'll have to deal with it in your code
[2015-07-22 10:31:16] mekhami: right now they just hit like a standing application
[2015-07-22 10:31:21] mekhami: but obviously
[2015-07-22 10:31:27] mekhami: the tests need to run against the system that travis builds
[2015-07-22 10:31:31] mekhami: otherwise what's the point
[2015-07-22 10:31:35] sjmikem, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-22 10:31:39] lukeis: 'localhost' ?
[2015-07-22 10:31:56] mekhami: okay but how can the grid hit localhost
[2015-07-22 10:32:10] lukeis: why are you using grid in travis?
[2015-07-22 10:32:17] mekhami: i'm using a grid period, for parallelization
[2015-07-22 10:32:28] lukeis: why are you using a grid in travis? :)
[2015-07-22 10:32:32] mekhami: i'm actually using browserstack, but they're essentially just a grid provider
[2015-07-22 10:32:40] mekhami: i'm not.. what.. that question doesn't make sense
[2015-07-22 10:33:01] mekhami: i have travis that wants to run the tests, it sends the tests off to the grid to run otherwise travis has to be provisioned to run tests as well?
[2015-07-22 10:35:04] mekhami: like i don't understand the disconnect here. PR happens, travis builds the application based on that PR, travis runs the tests. running the tests means running against the grid (browserstack).
[2015-07-22 10:35:12] mekhami: is this not the most obvious workflow ever?
[2015-07-22 10:36:09] sircapsalot: lukeis, i think mekhami is using a ".com" travis instance
[2015-07-22 10:36:25] mekhami: i don't know what that means
[2015-07-22 10:36:53] sircapsalot: travis-ci.org is free.  travis-ci.com is not.  you must be using a private one since you are using a grid
[2015-07-22 10:37:04] lukeis: this doesn't feel like a 'selenium' question :)
[2015-07-22 10:37:22] mekhami: ....
[2015-07-22 10:38:07] mekhami: sircapsalot: we're definitely using a private one
[2015-07-22 10:38:30] mekhami: i just don't understand why this isn't the most obvious thing in the world. travis needs to run selenium tests against a grid. duh?

[2015-07-22 10:39:32] sircapsalot: I think that's the disconnect
[2015-07-22 10:40:19] sircapsalot: this means that… your travis ci instance has the app code, then runs the app you want to test against
[2015-07-22 10:40:31] sircapsalot: then your grid points back to the travis url?
[2015-07-22 10:41:09] lukeis: if your selenium grid is running on an external system (browserstack) you need to connect to that url for your selenium tests…. which could / should be done with an environment variable, that you'd configure in your travis-ci yml or job
[2015-07-22 10:41:48] mekhami: right, but how would i know what that public-facing url woudl be
[2015-07-22 10:42:52] lukeis: how would we know? :)
[2015-07-22 10:43:25] sircapsalot: an idea comes to mind:  your travis instance declares a env variable, then your thingy mcdoohicker would be:  new RemoteDriver(new URL(ENV['the_url']))
[2015-07-22 10:43:30] sircapsalot: or wait that's wrong.

[2015-07-22 11:23:01] toothe: I don't want to set an arbitrary time of time.sleep(2) when the page might load in 0.4 seconds or 10 seconds.
[2015-07-22 11:23:41] jimevans: toothe: what's the next instruction that is failing?
[2015-07-22 11:24:04] toothe: well, usually a element lookup.
[2015-07-22 11:24:09] *jimevans starts to get socratic'
[2015-07-22 11:24:32] toothe: so, per google this is a common problem.
[2015-07-22 11:25:27] jimevans: have your web searches given you any ideas how the problem may be overcome? what are some of the techniques you've seen?
[2015-07-22 11:26:18] toothe: i'm looking into clickAndWait, just found it.
[2015-07-22 11:26:26] toothe: but, a lot of other ideas were also present.
[2015-07-22 11:26:33] jimevans: toothe: are you using webdriver or selenium RC?
[2015-07-22 11:26:57] jimevans: because 'clickAndWait' is an RC construct, and RC has been deprecated for about, oh, four years now.
[2015-07-22 11:28:15] jimevans: let me approach this a slightly different way. what needs to happen before you can proceed with the next thing? (hint: it's not "the following page must be loaded.") what condition needs to be met before the find_element() call can succeed?
[2015-07-22 11:28:16] toothe: webdriver.

[2015-07-22 11:51:19] jimevans: toothe: well, you can do it by finding the span as a child of the element you've already found (e.g. element.find_element_by_css_selector("span") )
[2015-07-22 11:51:31] toothe: ahh......
[2015-07-22 11:51:40] toothe: very django-like
[2015-07-22 11:51:43] jimevans: or you could find it in one step, without having to manipulate the parent element at all
[2015-07-22 11:52:07] jimevans: driver.find_element_by_css_selector(".abc span")
[2015-07-22 11:52:41] jimevans: which says "find a node with class having the value 'abc', and then find a descendent node of tag 'span'"
[2015-07-22 11:53:02] toothe: ahh...
[2015-07-22 11:53:04] *toothe tries.'
[2015-07-22 11:53:17] jimevans: css selectors are almost always better than other approaches with the possible exception of using id, and the very few scenarios that require xpath.
[2015-07-22 11:53:25] toothe: why so?
[2015-07-22 11:53:34] toothe: I'm selecting by ID. But why so?
[2015-07-22 11:53:47] jimevans: because the css selector engine is built directly into the browser.
[2015-07-22 11:53:50] jimevans: all browsers, in fact.
[2015-07-22 11:54:05] jimevans: because css is a technology used in the creation of modern websites
[2015-07-22 11:54:09] toothe: so, its an integration issue?
[2015-07-22 11:54:55] jimevans: i wouldn't say that necessarily, but they give you flexibility to find elements based on a number of criteria that using other methods would require multiple find_element calls
[2015-07-22 11:55:49] jimevans: find_by_class_name is a particularly egregious example of an outdated, outmoded locator mechanims.
[2015-07-22 11:55:54] jimevans: or mechanism even.
[2015-07-22 11:56:46] toothe: ahh....
[2015-07-22 11:57:07] toothe: so, given that I've written this minor project with it and it works, I'll keep it for now. However, I anticipate using Selenium quite a bit in the future and will certainly use that.

[2015-07-22 12:07:58] jimevans: if you're using webdriver to mix automated and manual processes, that's probably a Bad Thing™

[2015-07-22 12:09:39] BW^-: lukeis: how do you make Webdriver use the new window?
[2015-07-22 12:09:49] BW^-: aha
[2015-07-22 12:09:51] lukeis: driver.switch_to.window
[2015-07-22 12:09:55] BW^-: one way is just to make a new WebDriver instance
[2015-07-22 12:09:57] BW^-: aha nice
[2015-07-22 12:09:58] lukeis: driver.window_handles
[2015-07-22 12:10:05] jimevans: so, for example, if, with webdriver, you click on an element that brings up an alert, then manually dismiss that alert while your webdriver code is doing something else, you're likely to run into a timing issue there.
[2015-07-22 12:10:23] BW^-: jimevans: exactly, I experienced that already! :}

[2015-07-22 12:10:43] lukeis: and thus why there's an ExpectedCondition with the WebDriverWait
[2015-07-22 12:10:48] tony4, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-22 12:10:58] lukeis: (webdriverwait is a simple polling mechanism)
[2015-07-22 12:11:01] tony3, quitting. (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[2015-07-22 12:11:09] jimevans: so the answer to that is to let webdriver handle the alert. but you do have to be careful that you don't attempt to handle it before the alert actually exists
[2015-07-22 12:11:16] jimevans: hence the polling wait mechanism
[2015-07-22 12:11:31] jimevans: or, as it's called in the webdriver docs, "explicit waits"
[2015-07-22 12:11:50] jimevans: the name of which, i hate, but whaddayagonnado?
[2015-07-22 12:11:59] lukeis: as opposed to implicit waits (which do not apply to modal dialogs)

[2015-07-22 12:13:20] lukeis: blame :whobrokeit  … i think he named it
[2015-07-22 12:13:31] jimevans: because for some people, "explicit wait" == "thread.sleep"
[2015-07-22 12:13:40] BW^-: lukeis,jimevans: so the way I get WebDriver into the "Unexpected modal dialog" crash state, is by opening a WebDriver session,and doing some command (such as just, "set timeout"). then, manually, I go to  http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_alert and click "Try me", showing the alert
[2015-07-22 12:13:42] BW^-: I click "OK"
[2015-07-22 12:13:43] lukeis: which is indeed explicit :)
[2015-07-22 12:13:52] BW^-: lukeis,jimevans: and then, after that, I just try to do *any* other WebDriver command
[2015-07-22 12:13:53] jimevans: as in "i'm explicitly waiting for x milliseconds"
[2015-07-22 12:13:55] BW^-: and now, it will crash
[2015-07-22 12:14:03] BW^-: with the ""Unexpected modal dialog" error again
[2015-07-22 12:14:27] BW^-: jimevans,lukeis: that's how you crash it.
[2015-07-22 12:14:47] BW^-: jimevans,lukeis: so that is, *any* alert() or confirm() box interaction done manually, crashes WebDriver for that whole Firefox window, permanently
[2015-07-22 12:14:49] lukeis: did you call driver.switch_to.alert.dismiss()   after you clicked the button that causes the alert?
[2015-07-22 12:15:05] lukeis: it's not permanent
[2015-07-22 12:15:21] lukeis: the command after the one you get the exception with, should work :)
[2015-07-22 12:15:48] BW^-: lukeis,jimevans: When I do, it tells me "No alert is present", but the other WebDriver operations are still broken.
[2015-07-22 12:16:29] jimevans: could be a bug in the firefox driver's alert detection/handling, but it's not a global webdriver bug.
[2015-07-22 12:16:43] BW^-: lukeis,jimevans: nope - it will crash at this same place over and over aain: "stackTrace":[{"methodName":"fxdriver.modals.closeUnhandledAlert/<","fileName":"file:///midyr/.mozilla/firefox/ph29burb.BitFinex/extensions/fxdriver@googlecode.com/components/command-processor.js","lineNumber":9608,"columnNumber":84},{"methodName":"fxdriver.modals.isModalPresent/<","fileName":"file:///midyr/.mozilla/firefox/ph29burb.BitFinex/extensions/

[2015-07-22 12:17:56] BW^-: jimevans,lukeis: wait.. how would you open a new window in Webdriver, "window.open();" or alike i.e. ordinary JS?
[2015-07-22 12:17:56] lukeis: BW^-:  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/aa3d1ff466b5974d572f   :)

[2015-07-22 12:18:22] jimevans: BW^-: i wouldn't

[2015-07-22 12:18:32] BW^-: jimevans: why?
[2015-07-22 12:18:33] jimevans: execute_script would come the closest.
[2015-07-22 12:18:33] BW^-: mhm
[2015-07-22 12:18:35] BW^-: right
[2015-07-22 12:18:36] lukeis: but normally, no, why do you need to open a new window?
[2015-07-22 12:18:38] BW^-: yeah i'll try that good
[2015-07-22 12:18:43] BW^-: lukeis: to close the crashed one
[2015-07-22 12:18:44] BW^-: anyhow
[2015-07-22 12:18:48] lukeis: >.>
[2015-07-22 12:18:54] BW^-: just wanted to get an idea if this exception *requires* manual admin intervention
[2015-07-22 12:18:58] lukeis: it isn't crashed....
[2015-07-22 12:19:04] lukeis: and it worked for me… see my gist

[2015-07-22 12:19:18] BW^-: so you get current-url to work.. let me check!
[2015-07-22 12:19:26] BW^-: which web browser & version are you using?
[2015-07-22 12:19:33] lukeis: firefox 39
[2015-07-22 12:19:36] lukeis: os x
[2015-07-22 12:19:56] sircapsalot: it doesn't have syntax highlighting lukeis.. you know that programmers can't understand code without syntax highlighting..
[2015-07-22 12:19:57] jimevans: BW^-: what remote end are you using?
[2015-07-22 12:20:05] sircapsalot: ;)
[2015-07-22 12:20:06] lukeis: sircapsalot: dammit...
[2015-07-22 12:20:16] BW^-: sec
[2015-07-22 12:20:22] jimevans: by that i mean, you're sending json-over-http requests to *something*. what something is that?
[2015-07-22 12:20:54] BW^-: lukeis,jimevans: I tried doing current_url and it crashes too.  I'm on FireFox 31.4.0 ESR with WebDriver 2.46.0 on OpenBSD 5.7.
[2015-07-22 12:20:55] williara, quitting. (Quit: williara)
[2015-07-22 12:21:02] BW^-: so I conclude WebDriver is crashed.
[2015-07-22 12:21:10] BW^-: jimevans: just gettingt he url!
[2015-07-22 12:21:18] BW^-: or *anything*
[2015-07-22 12:21:21] BW^-: setting the timeout
[2015-07-22 12:21:24] BW^-: it's all crashed.
[2015-07-22 12:21:25] jimevans: BW^-: i'm asking a completely different question now.
[2015-07-22 12:21:29] BW^-: aha which?
[2015-07-22 12:21:37] lukeis: not reproducible… closes issue ;)
[2015-07-22 12:21:52] BW^-: lukeis: install OpenBSD and or just try with Firefox 31.4.0 ESR on your machine?
[2015-07-22 12:21:57] BW^-: I think you can get Firefox!
[2015-07-22 12:22:03] jimevans: what remote end are you using? you're sending json-over-http webdriver calls to *something*. what's the "something?"
[2015-07-22 12:22:17] BW^-: jimevans: to.. the webdriver plugin in Firefox?
[2015-07-22 12:22:19] BW^-: what do you mean?
[2015-07-22 12:22:34] jimevans: where did you get the webdriver plugin to firefox?
[2015-07-22 12:22:46] BW^-: jimevans: from the 2.46.0 JAR!
[2015-07-22 12:22:48] cframe, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2015-07-22 12:22:50] BW^-: webdriver.xpi it's called
[2015-07-22 12:23:23] jimevans: i… see...
[2015-07-22 12:24:22] BW^-: jimevans,lukeis: okay not even the "execute" call works
[2015-07-22 12:24:24] BW^-: so it'sf ried
[2015-07-22 12:24:25] BW^-: fried
[2015-07-22 12:24:32] jimevans: so we're *really* going off the rails of supported behavior here.
[2015-07-22 12:25:22] lukeis: so, you're likely launching firefox without all the normal preferences set
[2015-07-22 12:25:40] lukeis: (that webdriver expects to be set)
[2015-07-22 12:26:40] lukeis: BW^-: here's the firefox profile preferences that you should be setting :) https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/firefox-driver/webdriver.json
[2015-07-22 12:26:42] jimevans: um, yeah, i just did the same test on windows, using firefox 39. works just fine to me.
[2015-07-22 12:27:20] jimevans: (using the .NET bindings to launch the browser, and subsequently knock down the alert and retrieve the current url)
[2015-07-22 12:27:28] BW^-: jimevans,lukeis: and neither can I do execute_async
[2015-07-22 12:27:40] lukeis: BW^-: see my last few comments
[2015-07-22 12:27:43] BW^-: lukeis: ah thanks checking out =)
[2015-07-22 12:27:49] BW^-: wooooow
[2015-07-22 12:27:51] BW^-: lukeis: so nice!
[2015-07-22 12:27:55] BW^-: let's see =)
[2015-07-22 12:28:41] BW^-: hmm
[2015-07-22 12:29:00] BW^-: lukeis: so those are supposed to be fed into Firefox at startup time somehow, to be stored in Firefox as profile preferences/settings?
[2015-07-22 12:29:05] jimevans: BW^-: i wonder what would happen if you fired up the java standalone server and threw your json-over-http commands at *that* instead of directly to the firefox extension.
[2015-07-22 12:29:05] lukeis: keep in mind, most language bindings that launch firefox do so with a clean firefox profile or a copy of the one provided by a user
[2015-07-22 12:29:54] lukeis: BW^-: you should really read with Java / Python / C# / Ruby to understand the proper way to start up the firefox driver...
[2015-07-22 12:29:56] jimevans: in general, the firefox extension is not designed to be installed and used outside the context of a language binding.
[2015-07-22 12:30:14] lukeis: all other language bindings use the selenium-standalone server to start it up
[2015-07-22 12:30:27] D3M0S: lukeis, is it your bot that does the remind command?
[2015-07-22 12:30:30] jimevans: lukeis: um, that's not necessarily true.
[2015-07-22 12:30:45] lukeis: D3M0S: yes, selbot2 takes 'notes'
[2015-07-22 12:30:48] D3M0S: where it sends a message fater they log on
[2015-07-22 12:30:52] D3M0S: after*
[2015-07-22 12:31:09] lukeis: jimevans: i don't know of any other that starts up firefox-driver
[2015-07-22 12:31:30] D3M0S: lukeis, thanks, do you mind if I send this to another bot creator?
[2015-07-22 12:31:31] jimevans: .NET doesn't rely on the standalone server.
[2015-07-22 12:31:39] D3M0S: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selbot2/blob/master/lib/selbot2/notes.rb
[2015-07-22 12:31:40] jimevans: not for firefox
[2015-07-22 12:31:48] lukeis: D3M0S: sure? it's open source :)
[2015-07-22 12:31:56] lukeis: jimevans: i listed C#
[2015-07-22 12:31:57] D3M0S: awesome, thanks!
[2015-07-22 12:32:11] BW^-: jimevans,lukeis: aha.. hmm I understand
[2015-07-22 12:32:14] BW^-: it works *quite* well though
[2015-07-22 12:32:15] BW^-: hm
[2015-07-22 12:32:27] jimevans: lukeis: oh, soz. i misunderstood the context of "any other." my bad :)
[2015-07-22 12:32:31] BW^-: jimevans,lukeis: you mean, all bindings like Python, use "selenium-standalone server" which is some Java program?
[2015-07-22 12:32:42] jimevans: BW^-: not at all
[2015-07-22 12:33:03] BW^-: jimevans: my Firefox has webdriver.xpi installed in it, in a profile that we could call "MyFantasticProfile":
[2015-07-22 12:33:04] BW^-: .
[2015-07-22 12:33:13] jimevans: but all of the bindings do a metric crap-load of prep work before the browser is launched to make sure it's in the correct state to be communicated with.
[2015-07-22 12:33:16] lukeis: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/firefox_binary.py
[2015-07-22 12:33:23] BW^-: jimevans,lukeis: this stuff https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/firefox-driver/webdriver.json is code *internal* to WebDriver.XPI isn't it??
[2015-07-22 12:33:29] lukeis: no
[2015-07-22 12:33:31] BW^-: aha
[2015-07-22 12:33:38] jimevans: sorry. all of the bindings *provided by the project*
[2015-07-22 12:33:45] lukeis: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/firefox_profile.py#L40
[2015-07-22 12:34:17] lukeis: jimevans: i'm not sure the javascript ones do…
[2015-07-22 12:34:28] jimevans: lukeis: you're probably right on that one.
[2015-07-22 12:35:05] D3M0S: :note lukis "testing notes"
[2015-07-22 12:35:08] jimevans: but it hardly matters for javascript, because all of the entitled millennials who'd use javascript will insist on writing their own bindings anyway.
[2015-07-22 12:35:11] BW^-: ah.. ahaa.. wait i'm getting it slowly
[2015-07-22 12:35:14] kggr, quitting. (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[2015-07-22 12:35:18] D3M0S: oh you have to log off and on again though
[2015-07-22 12:35:23] jimevans: :)
[2015-07-22 12:35:27] lukeis: jimevans: i'm incorrect they do… https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/node/selenium-webdriver/firefox/binary.js
[2015-07-22 12:35:27] D3M0S: oh, or spell your name right
[2015-07-22 12:35:32] lukeis: :note D3M0S wrong name ;)
[2015-07-22 12:35:38] D3M0S: :note lukeis "testing notes"
[2015-07-22 12:35:42] lukeis: :)
[2015-07-22 12:35:46] lukeis: you don't have to log off
[2015-07-22 12:35:50] D3M0S: right
[2015-07-22 12:36:00] D3M0S: nice function
[2015-07-22 12:36:03] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-22 12:36:23] D3M0S: yeah my buddy said he'd add it to our local hackerspace irc
[2015-07-22 12:36:31] lukeis: D3M0S: you can also 'test' out the bot in another channel if you like… or PM selbot2
[2015-07-22 12:36:47] BW^-: lukeis,jimevans: so the ["frozen"] section of the webdriver.json file should simply be appended to the profile's user.js .
[2015-07-22 12:36:58] BW^-: lukeis,jimevans: and wait..w hat about the "mutable" section?  I don't catch immediately the meaning of the python code here!
[2015-07-22 12:36:59] lukeis: i used to run a clone of selbot2 on my internal work IRC channel (but then we moved to hipchat)
[2015-07-22 12:37:11] D3M0S: some of these hacker types, you can only get ahold of them on IRC and if they're not online, you're kinda SOL
[2015-07-22 12:37:40] lukeis: BW^-: please read through the existing bindings first please :)
[2015-07-22 12:38:00] BW^-: ok
[2015-07-22 12:38:15] D3M0S: I FINALLY got these junit tests running multithreaded
[2015-07-22 12:38:42] jimevans: BW^-: all of those (frozen and mutable) should be added to the profile. the language bindings ensure that those in the frozen section cannot be changed by users attempting to modify the profile settings, because the driver flat-out won't work if the frozen ones are changed
[2015-07-22 12:38:49] BW^-: lukeis,jimevans: okay I think the "mutable" section is included too - so - both the "frozen" and "mutable" sections should be appended to user.js
[2015-07-22 12:38:49] jimevans: i'm still failing to see any reason why using the json wire protocol directly is of any benefit to anyone outside of language binding authors.
[2015-07-22 12:38:49] D3M0S: I had to create a ThreadSafeSpringJUnit4ClassRunner
[2015-07-22 12:39:04] BW^-: ah awesome
[2015-07-22 12:39:24] BW^-: jimevans: I half qualify for that.. it's like please don't ask it's complicated =)))
[2015-07-22 12:39:30] BW^-: whatever
[2015-07-22 12:39:33] jimevans: i'm not afraid of complicated.
[2015-07-22 12:39:37] jimevans: not in the slightest
[2015-07-22 12:39:38] BW^-: thanks a lot for shedding light on that
[2015-07-22 12:39:54] jimevans: i've worked on the driver for internet explorer.
[2015-07-22 12:40:02] jimevans: so i'm good with complicated. :)
[2015-07-22 12:40:12] D3M0S: when most people say something like that, I assume they're talking out of their ass, I beleive jimevans though
[2015-07-22 12:40:18] lukeis: aka… please don't patronize us or diminish our intelligence by not explaining what you are doing :)
[2015-07-22 12:40:24] BW^-: =)
[2015-07-22 12:40:33] BW^-: jimevans: was that a lot of work !? =)
[2015-07-22 12:40:46] BW^-: ah no no i trust that
[2015-07-22 12:40:55] jimevans: nah, i had my first working version in a couple of hours.
[2015-07-22 12:40:58] jimevans: nope
[2015-07-22 12:41:03] lukeis: heh
[2015-07-22 12:41:07] jimevans: i couldn't keep a straight face typing that.
[2015-07-22 12:41:10] jimevans: sorry
[2015-07-22 12:41:49] lukeis: the amount of time jim has spent working on the IE Driver… measurable in months, if not years :)
[2015-07-22 12:41:58] lukeis: time straight i mean
[2015-07-22 12:42:59] jimevans: at least the chrome driver is owned by the chromium project developers.
[2015-07-22 12:43:10] BW^-: =)
[2015-07-22 12:43:18] BW^-: I understand that
[2015-07-22 12:43:21] jimevans: and there are more than a few mozilla folks who are active in the selenium community
[2015-07-22 12:43:21] BW^-: mhm
[2015-07-22 12:43:26] BW^-: aha
[2015-07-22 12:43:29] BW^-: while IE was just pure PITA
[2015-07-22 12:43:31] BW^-: ?
[2015-07-22 12:43:34] BW^-: that's respectable work man.
[2015-07-22 12:43:46] BW^-: in particular without the sourcecode
[2015-07-22 12:43:51] jimevans: well *somebody* had to do it.
[2015-07-22 12:44:19] AutomatedTester: awesome... windows is stuck on updates!
[2015-07-22 12:44:20] D3M0S: He's the hero we need but not the one we deserve
[2015-07-22 12:44:50] jimevans: D3M0S: *nobody* deserves me. i'm too big an a-hole.
[2015-07-22 12:45:06] AutomatedTester: not as big as an a-hole as me...
[2015-07-22 12:45:25] *jimevans conspicuously doesn't argue with AutomatedTester'
[2015-07-22 12:45:28] perfectsine, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2015-07-22 12:45:31] D3M0S: jimevans, do you ever feel like you just delayed the inevitable, do you think that had you done nothing IE would be dead and gone for good?
[2015-07-22 12:46:27] lukeis: safari hasn't died? ;)
[2015-07-22 12:46:40] AutomatedTester: lukeis: it's the new IE
[2015-07-22 12:46:43] D3M0S: like, there was some microsoft board meeting a few years ago "we should really kill the IE project, it's crap, nobody wants to develop on it because nobody can test on it....hold on, this dude just wrote a driver for it, we'll fund it for another 5 years!"
[2015-07-22 12:46:54] jimevans: i think that IE, like safari, would've always been around as a browser.
[2015-07-22 12:47:04] jimevans: too many enterprise developers
[2015-07-22 12:47:09] sircapsalot: LOL D3M0S
[2015-07-22 12:47:20] jimevans: people that don't develop for sites that ever see the public internet
[2015-07-22 12:47:27] MXfive, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-22 12:47:51] jimevans: the integration with other windows applications via the webview control (hosted trident, which is what IE uses) is just too deep
[2015-07-22 12:47:56] sircapsalot: i can't remember.. is Project Spartan (Edge) going to be based on a different engine?
[2015-07-22 12:48:26] D3M0S: well I'm glad they seem to be turning a new leaf, I hope they don't fuck it up
[2015-07-22 12:48:29] jimevans: sircapsalot: it's a forked version of trident, but one that has a ton of "legacy-IE-only" code stripped out of it.
[2015-07-22 12:48:47] jimevans: edge doesn't know anything about document modes
[2015-07-22 12:49:07] jimevans: and gives no fucks whatsoever about emulating earlier versions of any browser.
[2015-07-22 12:49:29] sircapsalot: what the F*** man…
[2015-07-22 12:49:37] sircapsalot: Trident … created in 1997
[2015-07-22 12:49:52] sircapsalot: i'm sure there's reasons not to leave.. but jeez
[2015-07-22 12:49:56] D3M0S: jimevans, none of that was a dig at you btw, it's just how I feel sometimes after doing some huge project, I start to wonder if I even made an impact, just wondered if some of those crazy thoughts have jumped in your head
[2015-07-22 12:50:16] jimevans: it goes an awfully long way to disguise the fact that it comes from IE's legacy from servers. doesn't mention IE at all in the user agent string
[2015-07-22 12:50:32] jimevans: D3M0S: well, nothing like that.
[2015-07-22 12:51:09] jimevans: but i *can* say that microsoft has mostly abandoned their development of a driver for IE largely because of the existing IE driver.
[2015-07-22 12:51:26] AutomatedTester: windows folks... I have been stuck on update 23 of 25 for at least 25 minutes...
[2015-07-22 12:51:36] AutomatedTester: can I force a restart?
[2015-07-22 12:51:47] D3M0S: AutomatedTester, I wouldnt
[2015-07-22 12:52:08] D3M0S: Windows is like your grandmas painted china eggs
[2015-07-22 12:52:11] jimevans: the direct quote was "we're concentrating on a driver for edge, but that means we need to quit working on the driver for IE, but we felt like we could get away with that because the open-source one works pretty damned well"
[2015-07-22 12:52:22] D3M0S: don't take it out of the cabinet when she tells you not to
[2015-07-22 12:52:59] D3M0S: jimevans, Basically, Bill Gates himeself gave you a pat on the back :)
[2015-07-22 12:53:34] jimevans: D3M0S: not so much, but that was in a direct discussion from one of the web platform team's product managers.

[2015-07-22 12:54:53] D3M0S: I wonder if someones figured out how to execute code via the font vulnerability to block it's own patch
[2015-07-22 12:55:11] jimevans: AutomatedTester: what version of windows is your VM running?
[2015-07-22 12:55:12] BW^-: lukeis,jimevans: what's the risk if I don't apply the "mutable" preference suggestions?
[2015-07-22 12:55:12] D3M0S: not to scare the shit out of you AutomatedTester, this is where my Hacker brain goes...
[2015-07-22 12:55:28] lukeis: BW^-: more failures? :)
[2015-07-22 12:56:15] AutomatedTester: jimevans: 8.1

[2015-07-22 12:56:35] lukeis: no, that's the risk
[2015-07-22 12:56:48] AutomatedTester: D3M0S: you are welcome to try hack my windows VM

[2015-07-22 12:57:50] D3M0S: AutomatedTester, if it's a VM and you don't care about it, then yeah, just force a restart on it
[2015-07-22 12:58:06] D3M0S: you probably have a snapshot before the update anyways
[2015-07-22 12:58:13] D3M0S: well...you should have a snapshot before the update
[2015-07-22 12:58:20] D3M0S: unless you really really don't care about it
[2015-07-22 12:58:25] AutomatedTester: I didnt do a snapshot
[2015-07-22 12:58:31] AutomatedTester: so windows would have done that?
[2015-07-22 12:58:38] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i'll give 'em until friday. then i'll start squawking.
[2015-07-22 12:58:53] D3M0S: nope, but theres a chance that your hypervisor is doing it for you
[2015-07-22 12:59:02] D3M0S: on a daily basis or w/e
[2015-07-22 12:59:51] D3M0S: what are you running your VM through?
[2015-07-22 13:00:03] AutomatedTester: VMWare Fusion

[2015-07-22 13:01:09] D3M0S: if it's not, I'd turn it on
[2015-07-22 13:01:17] D3M0S: and just set it to keep 1 snapshot
[2015-07-22 13:01:21] AutomatedTester: it doesnt appear to be
[2015-07-22 13:01:27] AutomatedTester: I have 0 snapshots
[2015-07-22 13:01:30] D3M0S: aww
[2015-07-22 13:01:35] D3M0S: well now you know
[2015-07-22 13:01:46] D3M0S: turn it on and set it to keep 1 snapshot and refresh it every day
[2015-07-22 13:01:51] AutomatedTester: and I posted back the disc and cd drive today
[2015-07-22 13:02:09] D3M0S: it takes a really tiny amount of space, and will save your ass at some point

[2015-07-22 14:01:01] jimevans: 1.7 or better
[2015-07-22 14:02:14] AutomatedTester: I am ready to test the marionette httpd executable on windows now
[2015-07-22 14:02:18] BW^-: jimevans: so this is my bug report =)
[2015-07-22 14:02:19] BW^-: anyhow
[2015-07-22 14:02:34] jimevans: AutomatedTester: w00t!
[2015-07-22 14:02:49] jimevans: BW^-: i can't reproduce your issue. full stop
[2015-07-22 14:04:15] AutomatedTester: ok... in about 10 mins I will be ready
[2015-07-22 14:04:27] *AutomatedTester waits for Java to download *sigh*'
[2015-07-22 14:05:51] BW^-: ok!
[2015-07-22 14:06:17] BW^-: jimevans: One question, I make an elements  xpath lookup to check that a particular xpath does *not* have any matches so that I *not* will get any elements
[2015-07-22 14:06:36] BW^-: it seems it's blocking until the timeout, expecting that it *should* get some results afterall?
[2015-07-22 14:06:54] BW^-: jimevans: I just want to *doublecheck that there are indeed no matches* - how would you do that generally?
[2015-07-22 14:06:55] jimevans: are you setting an implicit wait timeout
[2015-07-22 14:06:58] jimevans: ?
[2015-07-22 14:07:06] BW^-: jimevans: aha no, then that's what I need to do
[2015-07-22 14:07:16] BW^-: jimevans: so that implicit wait timeout will regard this particular elements-xpath only then right?
[2015-07-22 14:07:24] BW^-: jimevans: I should set it to 0 seconds?
[2015-07-22 14:07:46] jimevans: an implicit wait timeout will retry the find until an element is found or the timeout is reached.
[2015-07-22 14:07:47] lukeis: it's 0 by default unless you set it otherwise
[2015-07-22 14:07:55] BW^-: or.. hmm
[2015-07-22 14:08:03] BW^-: aha.. w8
[2015-07-22 14:08:04] jimevans: so if you're looking to fail-fast, you need to set it to the default of 0
[2015-07-22 14:08:37] MXfive, quitting. (Quit: Sleep)
[2015-07-22 14:08:45] BW^-: ahaaaa right, I set the "page load" and "implicit" indeed!!

[2015-07-22 14:08:56] BW^-: jimevans: right.. gotcha!

[2015-07-22 14:13:36] jimevans: AutomatedTester: how much work did you need to do to the rust source to get it compiling on windows? any? or just tooling glitches?
[2015-07-22 14:14:10] AutomatedTester: jimevans: Updating the build targets to remove parts that won't compile on windows
[2015-07-22 14:14:32] AutomatedTester: luckily it was parts that I dont need so it was a nice "cutting the fat away" exercise
[2015-07-22 14:14:59] jimevans: was just wondering how soon a '0.3' release could be made available. :)
[2015-07-22 14:15:17] AutomatedTester: jimevans: tomorrow or Friday

[2015-07-22 15:04:13] jimevans: double quotes around the path
[2015-07-22 15:04:44] lukeis: what if there's a path with double quotes?! o.0
[2015-07-22 15:04:49] lukeis: :)
[2015-07-22 15:04:54] D3M0S: escape the quotes
[2015-07-22 15:04:59] D3M0S: with spaces probably
[2015-07-22 15:05:04] D3M0S: :)
[2015-07-22 15:05:24] jimevans: lukeis: assuming you're not just trolling, i believe a double quote is an illegal character in a path.
[2015-07-22 15:05:37] lukeis: you assumed incorrectly
[2015-07-22 15:05:42] jimevans: i don't know if you can actually *make* a file or directory containing the double-quote.
[2015-07-22 15:05:43] jimevans: :)
[2015-07-22 15:05:55] AutomatedTester: I have "binary": "C:\Program Files\Nightly\Firefox.exe"
[2015-07-22 15:06:01] AutomatedTester: I think the space is cauing issues

[2015-07-22 15:06:16] jimevans: this is json?

[2015-07-22 15:06:54] jimevans: so try "binary": "\"C:\Program Files\Nightly\Firefox.exe\""
[2015-07-22 15:07:11] lukeis: don't the backslashes need escaping in the paths?
[2015-07-22 15:07:16] lukeis: so C:\\P...
[2015-07-22 15:07:33] jimevans: ah. yeah that's probably true if it's json

[2015-07-22 15:08:15] lukeis: why does windows *still* use an escape character for path separation….
[2015-07-22 15:08:27] lukeis: should just switch to /

[2015-07-22 16:21:34] arbos: hi, I have a question that is probably due to me not knowing much about javascript...
[2015-07-22 16:21:50] arbos: this javascript function is (I think) displaying a timer
[2015-07-22 16:22:02] arbos: but for the love of god the timer value is nowhere to be found in the html
[2015-07-22 16:22:09] arbos: or that it changes the html file

[2015-07-22 16:22:42] arbos: any tips on how to read the timer value, here is the function call from the html file: http://pastebin.com/QbfWkuaw
[2015-07-22 16:22:54] AutomatedTester: arbos: it will probably be changing the text content of the html element
[2015-07-22 16:23:46] arbos: AutomatedTester, yes that was exactly what I was thinking, some other values do exactly that... but this timer value seems to not even be in html
[2015-07-22 16:24:09] sgsabbage: is this the knob function from http://anthonyterrien.com/knob/ ?
[2015-07-22 16:25:01] arbos: sgsabbage it's a knob function iv to check if its the same but probably
[2015-07-22 16:25:14] arbos: yes pretty sure it is that one
[2015-07-22 16:25:32] sgsabbage: it looks like it's rendering directly on a <canvas> element
[2015-07-22 16:25:39] sgsabbage: mebbe
[2015-07-22 16:25:59] arbos: aha, I think you are right
[2015-07-22 16:26:19] arbos: there is also a canvas element
[2015-07-22 16:26:37] arbos: which didn't copy paste in the pastebin, maybe it didn't put it there yet
[2015-07-22 16:27:12] sgsabbage: I'm not sure there's a lot that can be done there with selenium as it's effectively outside of the DOM entirely
[2015-07-22 16:27:43] sgsabbage: I have almost no experience with <canvas> though, so someone with more knowledge may have other thoughts

[2015-07-22 16:28:47] arbos: I see hmm
[2015-07-22 16:29:36] AutomatedTester: oh it's canvas...
[2015-07-22 16:29:50] arbos: very interesting though, I never heard about canvas, good to learn about it
[2015-07-22 16:30:00] AutomatedTester: the only thing you can do is instrument that code that updates the canvas
[2015-07-22 16:31:56] sgsabbage: maybe, use execute() to execute some JS to get the value of the control and assert on that? I'm reaching here though
