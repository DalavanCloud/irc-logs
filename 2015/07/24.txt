[2015-07-24 05:31:41] AutomatedTester: I suspect if it doesnt work it is just silly platform assumptions

[2015-07-24 05:54:03] simonstewart: ?
[2015-07-24 05:54:44] AutomatedTester: moving everything to have a central source (we rely on Cargo downloading versions atM (yes... I know))
[2015-07-24 05:55:04] simonstewart: Buck has "remote_file" to support downloading bits
[2015-07-24 05:55:18] simonstewart: So you can still segment your source however you like
[2015-07-24 05:55:40] simonstewart: (Just because _I_ have strong opinions doesn't mean there aren't occasional cases where they're not _entirely_ correct)
[2015-07-24 05:55:48] AutomatedTester: oh I get that

[2015-07-24 05:57:23] AutomatedTester: oh yea...
[2015-07-24 05:57:47] AutomatedTester: but they are all downloads and I feel we could get away with not doing that
[2015-07-24 05:57:56] AutomatedTester: but I dont have the time to invest in that currently
[2015-07-24 05:58:08] simonstewart: Downloading constantly isn't a winning approach
[2015-07-24 05:58:14] simonstewart: But, you know, meh
[2015-07-24 05:58:24] AutomatedTester: it caches and tries to limit downloads
[2015-07-24 05:59:02] AutomatedTester: but my main point of contention with this philosophy is that it is more fun to cut your finger off than bisect failures

[2015-07-24 09:14:45] williara: But, its ports have been opened for 4444(default hub port) and 5555 (default node port)

[2015-07-24 10:40:37] jexmex: afternoon folks
[2015-07-24 10:40:55] D3M0S: almost....for me :)
[2015-07-24 10:41:04] D3M0S: afternoon to you
[2015-07-24 10:41:18] D3M0S: or good afternoon to you
[2015-07-24 10:41:43] jexmex: I am using selenium phantomjs, is it possible for me to pass source code to it, then parse the page? I already have the page request because I am using scrapy, but I need to run the javascript and then some a bit of javascript with it
[2015-07-24 10:42:12] D3M0S: driver.executeScript
[2015-07-24 10:42:27] jexmex: ok, will look into that
[2015-07-24 10:42:32] jexmex: thanks
[2015-07-24 10:42:53] D3M0S: you'll need to transform the driver object into a JavascriptExecutor object
[2015-07-24 10:43:12] D3M0S: via casting or w/e, what's your language of preference?
[2015-07-24 10:43:23] jexmex: python

[2015-07-24 10:44:22] D3M0S: seems the python bindings don't require that step
[2015-07-24 10:45:11] D3M0S: I don't know python very well, you might want to look into another example where you can pass in WebElements as args to the executeScript function
[2015-07-24 10:46:04] D3M0S: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14088541/how-to-execute-a-javascript-function-in-python-with-selenium
[2015-07-24 10:46:36] D3M0S: you can do some REALLY fancy stuff with the javascript executor
[2015-07-24 10:46:45] D3M0S: so you can like, inject your own code
[2015-07-24 10:47:02] D3M0S: then call that code using a webelement found in your python script with webdriver
[2015-07-24 10:47:29] D3M0S: but most will warn you here, that when you inject code into the page you're not testing the page that is meant to be tested
[2015-07-24 10:47:56] D3M0S: so keep that in mind and be responsible with it, make sure you're not invalidating the tests intent
[2015-07-24 10:48:38] jexmex: ok, I am just trying to run page source that was already retrieved to reduce a call. I am running a simulated scroll code on that as well, but not injecting anything into pages

[2015-07-24 11:17:08] jexmex: I am doing some benchmarking, it seems like the thing that slows me down the most is the actual iterating over each element found within a find elements by method (the actual code being executed on each item is not taking that long, but it seems like just iterating through each result does

[2015-07-24 11:21:43] jexmex: I am going to test this further, I took all my code out of the loop, replaced it with a print statement and am timing it now
[2015-07-24 11:23:57] jexmex: ok guess I was wrong. I benchmarked each item at around 2.5 seconds, but the total processing at 40 or so seconds (with about 6 items), so not sure how that is working
[2015-07-24 11:24:09] jexmex: could be a scrapy related issue
[2015-07-24 11:24:21] jexmex: oh well, back at trying to track down the reason

[2015-07-24 13:04:03] lukeis: then hack-tastic sounds like the best approach
[2015-07-24 13:04:51] dimacus: but yeah the fact that i keep seeing a bug where 1 node has 2 'slots' and it will pick up 2 tests at the same time instead of spreading the load amongst all idle nodes
[2015-07-24 13:05:39] dimacus: damn it… might as well do a PR

[2015-07-24 13:10:28] dimacus: instead of sorting it by whatever default sort order is
[2015-07-24 13:10:32] dimacus: sort it by idle
[2015-07-24 13:10:39] dimacus: idle nodes up top, busy in the end
[2015-07-24 13:11:10] lukeis: define "idle"? no executing tests?
[2015-07-24 13:11:21] lukeis: will you sort those that "have load" next?
[2015-07-24 13:12:27] dimacus: sure
[2015-07-24 13:12:30] dimacus: but just starting
[2015-07-24 13:12:45] lukeis: sorted by percentage utilized would probably be good…. 0/X == 0%    1 out of 3… 33%   1 out of 5…. ~13%   (lowest to highest)
[2015-07-24 13:12:49] dimacus: i have 1 test, i go to end of the line, i have 0 tests i go to top
[2015-07-24 13:13:56] dimacus: lukeis: i think just ordering them by busy not busy will be a huge huge fix
[2015-07-24 13:14:06] lukeis: yeah
[2015-07-24 13:14:15] dimacus: we can do the "how busy" next
[2015-07-24 13:14:27] dimacus: unless….. hmmmmm

[2015-07-24 13:17:21] lukeis: heh

[2015-07-24 13:56:12] lukeis: ok :)
[2015-07-24 13:56:29] dimacus: it's not nesserily % busy, but still if 1 node has 3 tests running, it should be checked way after all the nodes that have 0 or 1 tests running on them

[2015-07-24 14:31:40] titusfortner: yup copy/paste in commits works
[2015-07-24 14:31:51] dimacus: jimevans: if my fix can get it into next weeks release… i think you will save me about 2 hours each week on monday
[2015-07-24 14:32:06] dimacus: where 1/2 the grid is in a weird dead state and i have to reboot nodes like crazy
[2015-07-24 14:32:14] jleyba: should probably update node bindings for edge... but that require messing with a windows VM, so...
[2015-07-24 14:32:28] jimevans: jleyba: heh.
[2015-07-24 14:33:28] jimevans: I can go from clean VM to configured build environment in about 20 minutes.
[2015-07-24 14:33:44] jimevans: Modulo time to clone the repo.
[2015-07-24 14:33:59] dimacus: :note lukeis the tests on your code passed :) https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/832
[2015-07-24 14:35:17] jimevans: dimacus: I'll see what I can do. lukeis might be the best person to merge that in.
[2015-07-24 14:35:33] dimacus: yeah
[2015-07-24 14:35:43] dimacus: he helped with the actual code writing so let him do the merging
[2015-07-24 14:35:54] jimevans: Cool.
[2015-07-24 14:36:22] dimacus: i just see it as very fortuitous that there might be a release next week :)
[2015-07-24 14:37:01] jimevans: jleyba: look into chocolatey. pretty good for machine setup.
[2015-07-24 14:38:43] jimevans: dimacus: I just got an email from our friends in Redmond saying "Thanks for merging our pull request. When do you think it'll be released?"
[2015-07-24 14:39:43] dimacus: that's awesome
[2015-07-24 14:40:13] jimevans: So I'm trying to be accommodating. Détente, glasnost, promoting good relations, and all that.
[2015-07-24 14:41:10] dimacus: sheesh that would be great… keep them as happy customers
[2015-07-24 14:41:16] jimevans: Of course I suppose it'd be poetic justice to make 'em wait.
[2015-07-24 14:41:16] dimacus: everyone gets a huge bonus
[2015-07-24 14:41:30] dimacus: jimevans: you sir are better than that!
[2015-07-24 14:41:49] jimevans: You'd think that, wouldn't you? :)
[2015-07-24 14:42:08] dimacus: (trollface)
[2015-07-24 14:42:29] jimevans: Okay, I'm going back to bed. Hoping to feel better in the morning.
[2015-07-24 14:42:35] dimacus: while we are on the topic… make them pay for tech support if they upgrade
[2015-07-24 14:42:43] dimacus: jimevans: cheers
