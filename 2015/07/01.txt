[2015-07-01 09:09:48] jimevans: :note sevaseva my bad about missing expiry times. it was a .NET bindings parsing error, which i've now fixed. the chrome driver returns httponly cookies, just not the httponly attribute. would be nice to see if we could fix that; once a small change gets to firefox, chrome becomes an outlier in not returning that.

[2015-07-01 13:14:40] jimevans: (because the reason i'd be giving it a go would be to update the .NET bindings to support it)

[2015-07-01 13:16:39] AutomatedTester: the reason we havent released on Windows is due to Rust support being iffy
[2015-07-01 13:16:47] jimevans: i figured as much
[2015-07-01 13:16:50] jimevans: i'm not complaining.

[2015-07-01 13:17:18] jimevans: just can't/won't be pushing .net bindings support until windows binary is avaialble
