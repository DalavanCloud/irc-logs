[2015-07-30 09:07:44] dimacus: my PR did a minor change to the Collection.sort, where it just changed step 2), and sorted all of the nodes by how busy they are, idle ones go on top, busy ones on the bottom (totalUsedSlots / totalCapacipty)
[2015-07-30 09:08:07] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: is your life complete again? ;)
[2015-07-30 09:08:25] lukeis: and yes… i moved desks *again*
[2015-07-30 09:08:32] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: I thought as much :p
[2015-07-30 09:08:38] lukeis: 10th desk in 4.5 years ;)
[2015-07-30 09:08:39] WhereIsMySpoon: and yes ;)
[2015-07-30 09:08:49] WhereIsMySpoon: :api
[2015-07-30 09:08:51] dimacus: Dave_B_: it's not round robin per se… so some nodes will pick up more builds over and over right now, but at the very least, if there is a node that is idle while one is running 2 tests, the idle has a higher chance of picking up new build
[2015-07-30 09:08:52] WhereIsMySpoon: ODA_AG: ^
[2015-07-30 09:09:58] WhereIsMySpoon: i guess its kinda like a greedy round robin
[2015-07-30 09:10:03] WhereIsMySpoon: at the moment
[2015-07-30 09:10:05] dude-x: dimacus: that sounds a lot better now with your patch.
[2015-07-30 09:10:09] brma: dude-x, WhereIsMySpoon: I got to the bottom of my event questions.  It all comes down to the value of event.isTrusted, which is set to true for any event being initiated via webdriver synthetic events, but set to false when injecting js events directly on the page
[2015-07-30 09:10:09] WhereIsMySpoon: yea

[2015-07-30 09:11:42] WhereIsMySpoon: dude-x: I'd imagine some sort of pop-up appears when he clicks his input or similar
[2015-07-30 09:11:43] dimacus: dude-x: it's not perfect but yes it's an improvment… i've been watching 1 grid's logs in particular. The issue would be, there are 20 nodes 18 of which were 100% idle and 2 of them would be running 2 or 3 instances of chrome builds at the same time… as of the PR the load is spread thinly across all nodes, at any given point 5 to 15 of them are running 1 build each
[2015-07-30 09:12:28] Dave_B_: nice :)

[2015-07-30 11:19:31] lukeis: jimevans: uploading the internet as we speak for 2.47.1  … 2.47.0 "works" with maven in edge-driver… as long as you include the 'leg-rc' module (which is included by default)… so this isn't really *that* major of an issue
[2015-07-30 11:20:34] lukeis: if only i had a windows 10 vm where I could actually test it out! :-D
[2015-07-30 11:20:34] jimevans: yeah, except it didn't work at all for remote. :)

[2015-07-30 13:56:04] octomeow: doomrobo, what type of log are you asking to send?
[2015-07-30 13:56:17] octomeow: as far as I can see, it's used like get_log(log_type)
[2015-07-30 13:56:42] octomeow: and can be used like this: driver.get_log(‘browser’) driver.get_log(‘driver’) driver.get_log(‘client’) driver.get_log(‘server’)
[2015-07-30 13:58:25] doomrobo: octomeow, 'browser' and 'driver' work but they don't return what I'm looking for. Also I'm setting the corresponding loggingPrefs keys to "ALL" just in case
[2015-07-30 13:58:30] D3M0S: Anybody aware of an overview or design pattern when a Page Object action could return multiple page types?  Like if I login correctly when pusing the submit button on a login form, I would return the customer page, but if I log in incorrectly, I could return the password reset page, both require the same button press

[2015-07-30 14:01:41] doomrobo: octomeow, 'performance' gives me the same stuff as 'driver' I think
[2015-07-30 14:01:48] doomrobo: nothing from the extension
[2015-07-30 14:02:20] AutomatedTester: hirani: did the cert expire?
[2015-07-30 14:03:53] hirani: AutomatedTester: The website is our internal test server. Its certificate has always been invalid.

[2015-07-30 14:07:23] doomrobo: octomeow, a private extension I'm working on. I know for a fact that it's doing console.log() and I see the output in the chrome console
[2015-07-30 14:08:23] octomeow: hmmm.
[2015-07-30 14:08:53] hirani: octomeow: i am adding that one. But I meant the one that firefox profile use (prefs.js file)
