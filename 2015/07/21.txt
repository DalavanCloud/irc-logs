[2015-07-21 01:24:56] EdwardIII: selenium you absolute strange thing: it finds the element but times out when clicking it. clicking it does a post which then redirects to another page eventually: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/0567767f4f71a09afec5#file-gistfile1-txt-L23-L24
[2015-07-21 01:25:12] EdwardIII: the next step is to look for some content on the other page inside waitFor
[2015-07-21 01:25:24] EdwardIII: but it never gets that far
[2015-07-21 01:25:41] EdwardIII: selenium shouldn't be broken by redirecting to another domain should it? think testing a flow that goes through paypal sandbox
[2015-07-21 01:26:37] EdwardIII: hmm it's going from http to https
[2015-07-21 01:26:44] EdwardIII: i see an old bug to do with ie7 and this issue

[2015-07-21 02:03:41] sgsabbage: uh oh, what did I do? :D
[2015-07-21 02:03:45] EdwardIII: i've come up with some guessed as to why it's failing
[2015-07-21 02:03:56] EdwardIII: i've seen some buzz about issues when selenium switches from http:// to https:// across domains
[2015-07-21 02:04:04] sri_, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2015-07-21 02:04:07] EdwardIII: so i've setup my test env to have ssl, but obviously it's self signed so FF errors
[2015-07-21 02:04:14] sgsabbage: oooh
[2015-07-21 02:04:15] EdwardIII: any idea how i can setup a ff profile to have that cert in it's trust list?
[2015-07-21 02:04:16] sgsabbage: ok
[2015-07-21 02:04:23] EdwardIII: and then get selenium to use that profile?
[2015-07-21 02:04:25] sgsabbage: I do veeery little with firefox, but let me check
[2015-07-21 02:04:30] EdwardIII: oh which do you use?
[2015-07-21 02:04:31] EdwardIII: chrome?
[2015-07-21 02:04:34] sgsabbage: yarp
[2015-07-21 02:04:43] EdwardIII: any good headless?
[2015-07-21 02:05:07] sgsabbage: ah, no, I don't do it headless, I do it all on windows servers (that said I would much rather use sauce labs but for what we need $$$)
[2015-07-21 02:05:14] EdwardIII: heh yeah
[2015-07-21 02:05:20] EdwardIII: you work on 1 product the whole time i guess?
[2015-07-21 02:05:22] sgsabbage: though, if I were going to use chrome linux (and I did for about a year)
[2015-07-21 02:05:24] sgsabbage: yup
[2015-07-21 02:05:33] sgsabbage: I would use Xvfb to run it headless
[2015-07-21 02:06:15] EdwardIII: works ok in FF, yes i guess it should work ok for chrome
[2015-07-21 02:06:17] EdwardIII: but what's the approach there?
[2015-07-21 02:06:39] sgsabbage: oh, I have no idea on the SSL cert front for Chrome ;) our test server uses our wildcard cert
[2015-07-21 02:06:46] sgsabbage: but, let me poke around for a minute
[2015-07-21 02:07:45] sgsabbage: (stops me from having to deal with WiX for a second)
[2015-07-21 02:07:58] EdwardIII: hehe wix the cms?
[2015-07-21 02:08:30] sgsabbage: nope, WiX the windows installer toolset
[2015-07-21 02:08:41] EdwardIII: ah
[2015-07-21 02:10:29] sgsabbage: so, there is a -trustAllSSLCertificates option for the Selenium server
[2015-07-21 02:10:43] sgsabbage: but it does say it needs to use the Selenium proxy so that may not work
[2015-07-21 02:10:55] sgsabbage: (I don't know enough about the internals to be able to say if it will or not)
[2015-07-21 02:11:32] EdwardIII: lemme spin it

[2015-07-21 02:14:40] sgsabbage: as I am now apparently the PHP Guy I declare that we're just going to use the facebook bindings, screw it. Even though I don't use them myslef
[2015-07-21 02:14:56] EdwardIII: hmm yeah that switch on the selenium server doesn't seem to work
[2015-07-21 02:15:02] EdwardIII: interestingly it... times out!
[2015-07-21 02:15:10] EdwardIII: exactly like on button click -> redirect
[2015-07-21 02:15:47] EdwardIII: hrm now how the hell do i pass through desiredCapabilities heh
[2015-07-21 02:16:16] EdwardIII: hehe errr i'm gonna guess ->setDesiredCapabilities([])
[2015-07-21 02:17:35] EdwardIII: wow that was actually it: 10:10:18.925 INFO - Done: [new session: Capabilities [{acceptSslCerts=true, browserName=*firefox}]]
[2015-07-21 02:18:19] sgsabbage: haha

[2015-07-21 02:18:26] EdwardIII: no hehe

[2015-07-21 02:19:45] EdwardIII: i'm not sure how acceptAllCerts would work though
[2015-07-21 02:24:33] sgsabbage: are you able to visit the test-dev pages on your local machine?
[2015-07-21 02:24:43] sgsabbage: and does it give you a bog standard security error
[2015-07-21 02:24:48] EdwardIII: it does yeah
[2015-07-21 02:24:55] sgsabbage: wunderufl
[2015-07-21 02:25:25] sgsabbage: so this is partway there, but not everything you need http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24507078/how-to-deal-with-certificates-using-selenium (I'm still searching because firefox profiles are outside of my knowledge sphere)
[2015-07-21 02:25:45] sgsabbage: and selenium server does have -firefoxProfileTemplate as an option
[2015-07-21 02:25:46] EdwardIII: hrm actually it has a wrong name as well
[2015-07-21 02:26:02] EdwardIII: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/46f1531b4c458e6f4a61
[2015-07-21 02:26:22] EdwardIII: so it's erroring because it's self-signed and also because it's for the name 'vagrantbox'
[2015-07-21 02:26:47] sgsabbage: still, you should be able to just skip that, maybe
[2015-07-21 02:28:44] EdwardIII: yeah i skip it in the normal way
[2015-07-21 02:29:24] EdwardIII: heh hrmm ok let me see if i can translate this into the php api...
[2015-07-21 02:29:37] sgsabbage: you may need to generate the profile first
[2015-07-21 02:29:56] sgsabbage: I'm not sure, a lot of that isn't using Grid, it's just directly connecting to the firefox WD implemtnation
[2015-07-21 02:31:42] EdwardIII: yeah i wonder how to make selenium load that profile first
[2015-07-21 02:31:50] EdwardIII: i guess i can just make the profile on my host machine

[2015-07-21 06:32:18] WhereIsMySpoon: R1ppa: not possible, you need to use webdriver

[2015-07-21 06:32:26] R1ppa: I find it difficult to get Chrome and IE to run the same code as Firefox, I thought it would be more flexible
[2015-07-21 06:32:40] R1ppa: WhereIsMySpoon, so using RC what does that mean to me?
[2015-07-21 06:32:50] WhereIsMySpoon: RC is deprecated and old
[2015-07-21 06:32:58] WhereIsMySpoon: it is not updated or supported
[2015-07-21 06:33:00] WhereIsMySpoon: use webdriver
[2015-07-21 06:33:06] R1ppa: WhereIsMySpoon, stil reading what the real difference is between all different Seleniums
[2015-07-21 06:33:21] WhereIsMySpoon: RC is the old technology (1.0
[2015-07-21 06:33:22] WhereIsMySpoon: )
[2015-07-21 06:33:24] R1ppa: WhereIsMySpoon, ooops sorry I meant Webdriver
[2015-07-21 06:33:26] WhereIsMySpoon: webdriver is 2.0
[2015-07-21 06:33:32] WhereIsMySpoon: the IDE is built on RC
[2015-07-21 06:33:56] R1ppa: WhereIsMySpoon, so making a webdriver IDe in Eclipse, then using Firefox IDE to produce test cases code, this doesnt work right?
[2015-07-21 06:34:16] WhereIsMySpoon: there is no "webdriver ide"
[2015-07-21 06:34:24] sircapsalot: .. I think you are confusing "Eclipse IDE" with "Selenium IDE"
[2015-07-21 06:34:30] R1ppa: WhereIsMySpoon, ohhhh RC old, built from IDE, so no one picked up IDE to keep it updated?
[2015-07-21 06:34:46] R1ppa: sircapsalot, no not confusing them, but prolly having trouble explaining well to you guys hehe
[2015-07-21 06:34:53] sircapsalot: no.. the IDE is built with Selenium 1 (RC)
[2015-07-21 06:34:58] WhereIsMySpoon: R1ppa: not really
[2015-07-21 06:35:29] R1ppa: so with no programming in my blood, is there no easy way now to produce test cases for all browsers
[2015-07-21 06:35:32] R1ppa: ?
[2015-07-21 06:35:37] perfectsine, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-21 06:36:27] WhereIsMySpoon: R1ppa: correct, automated test programming is a programmer's job
[2015-07-21 06:36:32] WhereIsMySpoon: not a manual tester's job
[2015-07-21 06:36:42] R1ppa: lol I suppose that makes sense
[2015-07-21 06:37:00] R1ppa: my boss is like "figure out Selenium" yikes
[2015-07-21 06:37:00] WhereIsMySpoon: R1ppa: you will find that sentiment echoed by most people here
[2015-07-21 06:37:11] sircapsalot: it is possible though, of course, R1ppa.. just not easy :)
[2015-07-21 06:37:19] WhereIsMySpoon: sure, you can learn to program
[2015-07-21 06:37:27] WhereIsMySpoon: and webdriver's api is quite simple
[2015-07-21 06:37:47] R1ppa: I agree with you guys, but it was nice to be able to use Firefox IDE then import that into my Eclipse IDE, but man so many problems which explains what you are telling me deprecated and borked

[2015-07-21 06:38:21] EdwardIII: third person in 2 days
[2015-07-21 06:38:33] WhereIsMySpoon: the IDE produced flaky and unreliable tests
[2015-07-21 06:38:49] R1ppa: I can confirm that hehe
[2015-07-21 06:38:55] WhereIsMySpoon: then why bother at all
[2015-07-21 06:38:59] WhereIsMySpoon: better to just continue manually
[2015-07-21 06:39:05] WhereIsMySpoon: if u arent gonna do it automatically properly
[2015-07-21 06:39:07] R1ppa: because thats my job to do as I am told
[2015-07-21 06:39:13] WhereIsMySpoon: :| :| :|
[2015-07-21 06:39:20] R1ppa: now I will just tell them to get a testing programmer than, IDE is dead
[2015-07-21 06:39:21] BHS_error: erm, what will be included in Selenium 3 ?
[2015-07-21 06:39:26] WhereIsMySpoon: that sounds crap R1ppa
[2015-07-21 06:39:35] EdwardIII: to be honest though, the website doesn't exactly make it clear that all this stuff is deprecated: http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
[2015-07-21 06:39:41] R1ppa: WhereIsMySpoon, well you know, sysadmin, go figure it out kind of deal
[2015-07-21 06:39:43] WhereIsMySpoon: R1ppa: your manager and your job should give you some say in what you do and how you do it
[2015-07-21 06:40:02] R1ppa: WhereIsMySpoon, they do to some extent, I will tell them its a waste of my time now
[2015-07-21 06:40:15] R1ppa: WhereIsMySpoon, if they try to put another hat on my head, PEACE ;)
[2015-07-21 06:40:31] R1ppa: thanks so much guys for the answers

[2015-07-21 06:41:41] WhereIsMySpoon: EdwardIII: Selenium IDE is a Firefox plugin which records and plays back user interactions with the browser. Use this to either create simple scripts or assist in exploratory testing. It can also export Remote Control or WebDriver scripts, though they tend to be somewhat brittle and should be overhauled into some sort of Page Object-y structure for
[2015-07-21 06:41:42] WhereIsMySpoon:  any kind of resiliency.
[2015-07-21 06:41:48] WhereIsMySpoon: see especially last bit
[2015-07-21 06:42:03] EdwardIII: yes i did see that heh
[2015-07-21 06:42:21] EdwardIII: i tell you what though it was an amazingly useful feature
[2015-07-21 06:42:28] EdwardIII: really helped kick start test writing
[2015-07-21 06:42:31] WhereIsMySpoon: EdwardIII: RC isnt even there for download
[2015-07-21 06:43:27] WhereIsMySpoon: EdwardIII: unfortunately it comes with a -lot- of extra crap that the selenium devs understandably dont want in the code base
[2015-07-21 06:43:27] sircapsalot: definitely nice to play with if you are just getting started with web automation

[2015-07-21 07:27:15] AutomatedTester: jimevans: marionette is probably going to suffer from this too
[2015-07-21 07:27:19] AutomatedTester: as well as ChromeDriver
[2015-07-21 07:27:35] AutomatedTester: ChromeDriver errors if it thinks you might hit a different element
[2015-07-21 07:29:02] jimevans: i suspect that, in the reporter's eyes, an error would be preferrable.
[2015-07-21 07:30:00] jimevans: but then again, i'm speculating on that one.
[2015-07-21 07:30:20] AutomatedTester: sure but this is not "defined" behavour

[2015-07-21 07:36:01] jimevans: more seriously, though, i'm reveling in the irony that we've said, "oh, synthetic events are good enough, and no one has provided a scenario where they break down," and yet, someone calls our bluff on it, and i *know* what's going to happen on that issue. nothing. because nobody cares.
[2015-07-21 07:36:24] AutomatedTester: I do care

[2015-07-21 07:57:49] dude-x: using the latest chrome driver and release Chrome, if you just do driver.find_element(By.x, 'select#blah').click() it just works!
[2015-07-21 07:57:54] dude-x: i was surprised.
[2015-07-21 07:58:09] dude-x: I thought that was a native events thing only.
[2015-07-21 07:58:30] AutomatedTester: what is By.x?
[2015-07-21 07:59:15] dude-x: By.CSS_SELECTOR, but nevermind the exact locator
[2015-07-21 07:59:58] AutomatedTester: that should work in all drivers...

[2015-07-21 11:13:38] LocusAsaf: Does anyone have any point of views on collecting errors and doing a sort of multi assert at the end of a test?
[2015-07-21 11:14:02] LocusAsaf: For instance if there are two assertions I would like to make in a test, asserting them combined at the end so I know if both things failed or just 1?
[2015-07-21 11:15:05] smccarthy: LocusAsaf: kind of like a SoftAssert (in TestNG) ?
[2015-07-21 11:15:52] LocusAsaf: smccarthy: I'm not sure about TestNG, but essentially I want to check two things and if the first is False I can still safely check the 2nd
[2015-07-21 11:16:12] smccarthy: LocusAsaf: ok yea, I have done that before, using TestNG's SoftAssert.
[2015-07-21 11:16:13] lukeis: i try to avoid those, but sometimes there's situations it feels like it's ok… but then i smack myself in the face and remember that no, just assert, if it's wrong enough to fail the test later, it's fine to fail it first
[2015-07-21 11:16:18] LocusAsaf: so I dont want to the test to end right away and would rather know if both things are broken so it saves time in terms or re-running the test to find out the next thing is broken after you fix the first
[2015-07-21 11:16:50] lukeis: the 'save-time' is not much time saved :)
[2015-07-21 11:17:02] lukeis: re-running the test *should* not take that long
[2015-07-21 11:17:09] smccarthy: haha I want to have 1 test for my entire test suite, and all SoftAssert's and 1 assertAll at the end.
[2015-07-21 11:17:21] lukeis: >.>
[2015-07-21 11:18:15] LocusAsaf: lukeis: can you say in another way what you meant by "if it's wrong enough to fail the test later, it's fine to fail it first"
[2015-07-21 11:19:05] lukeis: if the error is something I care about enough to fail the test… then I should fail the test as fast as possible.

[2015-07-21 12:58:54] lukeis: AutomatedTester: actually, i think the prose in the spec meets my assumption…. next to all the alert commands it says "If no alert is present a https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#status-no-such-alert must be raised."

[2015-07-21 15:30:15] NoodlesNZ: I'm getting a "java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.lang.Number" when trying to use findElement on Selenium 2.46 (via facebook's php webdriver sdk). Is that a problem with Selenium or the sdk?
[2015-07-21 15:31:04] sgsabbage: what's the full call you're making?
[2015-07-21 15:31:39] NoodlesNZ: in php it's: $this->webDriver->findElement(WebDriverBy::id('livesearch-imprint'));
[2015-07-21 15:32:01] NoodlesNZ: I can get the full stack trace if that helps
[2015-07-21 15:32:22] sgsabbage: I think that's probably enough, bear with me for a second
[2015-07-21 15:33:17] sgsabbage: actually, yeah, if you could :gist the full stack trace
[2015-07-21 15:33:45] NoodlesNZ: http://pastebin.com/0eYkjmev
[2015-07-21 15:34:17] NoodlesNZ: sorry, I already used pastebin before I saw your message, can move to gist if you'd prefer
[2015-07-21 15:34:29] sgsabbage: nah, both work for me :)
[2015-07-21 15:34:41] sgsabbage: I only said gist because selbot has a macro for it ;)
[2015-07-21 15:34:44] NoodlesNZ: some ppl have a dislike of pastebin for some reason :)
[2015-07-21 15:35:00] lukeis: it's the ads ;)
[2015-07-21 15:35:45] NoodlesNZ: so I've tried this across 3 platforms, Mac OS X 10.10.4, Windows 7 and CentOS 6.5
[2015-07-21 15:35:56] NoodlesNZ: all give the same response when using findElement
[2015-07-21 15:36:42] lukeis: NoodlesNZ: you'll need to get the log from the standalone server i think…
[2015-07-21 15:36:56] lukeis: although, that looks like it...
[2015-07-21 15:37:07] NoodlesNZ: yea, that's all I have (the standalone logs)
[2015-07-21 15:37:13] NoodlesNZ: in the pastebin
[2015-07-21 15:38:02] lukeis: so, it basically got an exception while processing the find element and didn't respond with a proper error response….
[2015-07-21 15:38:02] sgsabbage: yeah, that's confusing me, I can't see why that would happen
[2015-07-21 15:38:20] lukeis: might need to look at the Firefox developer console   (ctrl-shift J )
[2015-07-21 15:38:37] NoodlesNZ: ok, hold the line, lets see what I can get
[2015-07-21 15:39:50] NoodlesNZ: nothing special in there
[2015-07-21 15:41:33] NoodlesNZ: and I can definitely see the element in the DOM

[2015-07-21 16:09:13] lukeis: sorry for closing that issue right away NoodlesNZ, but we much prefer to have reproducible issues (with reproduction steps listed) anything else, should go to the user list first for vetting… also it could be an issue in the PHP bindings

[2015-07-21 16:09:44] lukeis: (which would be logged elsewhere, if it was a php issue)
[2015-07-21 16:10:33] NoodlesNZ: no problem, would it help if I posted the PHP code to replicate it? I added an issue for facebook's webdriver repo, but I thought it might be more Selenium specific
[2015-07-21 16:11:05] NoodlesNZ: I'm trying a fresh build from the selenium repo to see if it exists in the latest code
[2015-07-21 16:12:51] lukeis: NoodlesNZ: so i get a weird error when i try it in python…. https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lukeis/b4ee0dbaefeddde69b1d/raw/dc7a0092c03b5af5f4f569da2ee32461aadaf085/gistfile1.txt

[2015-07-21 16:14:24] lukeis: seems like
[2015-07-21 16:14:42] NoodlesNZ: thanks, I'll have a bit of a play and see where I get
[2015-07-21 16:14:58] NoodlesNZ: should probably be handled a bit more gracefully by selenium though
