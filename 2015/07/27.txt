[2015-07-27 07:58:28] AutomatedTester: it's released but not spreading the news yet
[2015-07-27 07:58:32] davehunt: AutomatedTester: was my feedback helpful?
[2015-07-27 07:58:55] Bootinbull, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-27 07:59:00] AutomatedTester: davehunt: yea it was, some of the things are because the W3C implementation and webdriver have diverged
[2015-07-27 07:59:19] AutomatedTester: e.g. Pagesource
[2015-07-27 07:59:26] davehunt: yeah, I understand - are we going to address those?
[2015-07-27 07:59:34] AutomatedTester: yea
[2015-07-27 07:59:43] AutomatedTester: actually... I might do that now
[2015-07-27 07:59:47] davehunt: great, the user shouldn't hit those issues imo
[2015-07-27 07:59:56] aj4u: you guys looking for someone to help out with Selenium issues ?
[2015-07-27 08:00:06] jimevans: if i wanted to use it with any other language than python, i'll need a w3c-dialect compliant binding, yeah?
[2015-07-27 08:00:13] AutomatedTester: davehunt: the window ones are because the endpoint was incorrectly created in webdriver
[2015-07-27 08:00:38] AutomatedTester: jimevans: kinda
[2015-07-27 08:00:44] jimevans: o rly?
[2015-07-27 08:01:00] davehunt: AutomatedTester: oh, Bob also pointed out that all of the logs appear to be ERROR level, even successful ones
[2015-07-27 08:01:14] AutomatedTester: "all of the logs"
[2015-07-27 08:01:17] AutomatedTester: what logs?
[2015-07-27 08:01:40] AutomatedTester: jimevans: sorry you are right, it needs to be a w3c-dialect of the json wire packet
[2015-07-27 08:02:03] jimevans: AutomatedTester: good. as it should be. gives me the excuse i need to write one of those. ;)

[2015-07-27 08:02:18] AutomatedTester: jimevans: at least for python it was really simple
[2015-07-27 08:02:41] jimevans: i fear it won't be as simple for statically typed languages
[2015-07-27 08:02:54] jimevans: or maybe just c# will be the bitch because of the json library
[2015-07-27 08:03:11] jimevans: either way, i'll figure it out.
[2015-07-27 08:03:26] jimevans: has to be done sooner or later anyhow.

[2015-07-27 11:22:07] auto_sam: when doing a locator query on an element, is it possible to only select direct children?
[2015-07-27 11:22:12] auto_sam: example #1: driver.find_element_by_css_selector("div.parent > div.child") gives only direct child
[2015-07-27 11:22:17] auto_sam: example #2: parent_elem = driver.find_element_by_css_selector("div.parent"); child_elem = parent_elem.find_element_by_css_selector("div.child")
[2015-07-27 11:22:23] auto_sam: #2 could also select "div.child" elements that are not direct children... how can this be avoided?
[2015-07-27 11:24:29] dude-x: auto_sam driver.find_elements_by_css_selector to get more than one element
[2015-07-27 11:25:08] auto_sam: dude-x: yes, but how do I only select the direct children?
[2015-07-27 11:25:50] dude-x: div.parent div should select all divs under div.parent
[2015-07-27 11:26:15] dude-x: hmm
[2015-07-27 11:26:34] auto_sam: correct, but what I really want is "div.parent > div.child"... notice the ">"
[2015-07-27 11:27:41] dude-x: yeah i am thinking...
[2015-07-27 11:28:23] jimevans: auto_sam: what does element.querySelector() do (in the browser's javascript developer console)?
[2015-07-27 11:28:27] dude-x: do the child divs have matching characteristics?
[2015-07-27 11:28:53] jimevans: because ultimately, it's not a findElement question, it's a querySelector question.

[2015-07-27 11:31:22] auto_sam: jimevans, I see... I guess it is not possible.  I originally thought that I could do parent_elem.find_element_by_css_selector(" > div.child") but it throws invalid/illegal string

[2015-07-27 11:38:40] auto_sam: dude-x, ty.  I was using the singular/plural interchangeably just for demonstration purposes.  And it was more of a paradigm question than a "how do I make a locator for this 1 case" question

[2015-07-27 14:12:47] kyoob: hi
[2015-07-27 14:13:03] kyoob: it's recently been brought to my attention that for-if is an antipattern.
[2015-07-27 14:14:14] kyoob: like {list boxs = find.boxes; for box in boxes{ if box.text==string {do stuff;} }
[2015-07-27 14:14:29] kyoob: what'sa better way to do that?
[2015-07-27 14:14:51] jimevans: list boxes = find.boxes.where.text == string
[2015-07-27 14:15:32] kyoob: and then boxes.doStuff() ?
[2015-07-27 14:15:47] kyoob: or i guess doStuff(boxes();
[2015-07-27 14:15:59] jimevans: yeah, then you can do foreach box in boxes { dostuff }
[2015-07-27 14:16:02] kyoob: man even my pseudocode is sloppy today
[2015-07-27 14:16:25] kyoob: isn't that doing the same thing behind the scenes?

[2015-07-27 14:16:37] jmeaney__, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-27 14:16:47] jimevans: no, because by narrowing down the list of boxes returned in the first place, you're saving a couple of round-trips
[2015-07-27 14:17:24] jimevans: remember that every webdriver method call has to be treated as an RPC call. every. single. one.
[2015-07-27 14:18:25] kyoob: but it has to look at all the boxes either way
[2015-07-27 14:18:41] jimevans: and as slow as the xpath processor may be (and you'll be using xpath to do that), it still has the potential to be an order of magnitude faster than network i/o
[2015-07-27 14:18:48] kyoob: does box.getText() still make the trip even if they're webelements socked away into a list?
[2015-07-27 14:18:53] jimevans: yes.
[2015-07-27 14:19:01] kyoob: ah ha
[2015-07-27 14:19:06] jimevans: it's the only way to determine the text of the bos
[2015-07-27 14:19:07] kyoob: i thought those were saved to memory
[2015-07-27 14:19:07] jimevans: box
[2015-07-27 14:19:09] jimevans: nope.
