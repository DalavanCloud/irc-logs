[2015-02-04 06:25:40] barancev: don't blame native events in all failures :)
[2015-02-04 06:26:15] antsanto: oh thanks. But any idea, why it just hangs :( if native events are off, then this causes this issue?
[2015-02-04 06:27:55] antsanto: smccarthy: Thanks for the link. Looks interesting. I guess, that might be the reason.
[2015-02-04 06:28:03] smccarthy: barancev: lol It was just an idea. I really have no clue, but from working on Mac and not working on Windows, I thought it was worth a shot
[2015-02-04 06:28:44] barancev: antsanto: what operation hangs?
[2015-02-04 06:28:51] antsanto: smccarthy: So click() and other works via js in mac and real events (native) in windows?
