[2015-02-11 01:46:46] Dave_B_: hmmm, on the chat from last night about chrome checking if element is clickable / on top and firefox not, this sometimes breaks functional tests
[2015-02-11 01:47:50] Dave_B_: e.g. lightboxes (shudder) often get closed by clicking on stuff in the background - but in FF the background element actually gets the click while chrome sends the click to the place and the transparent layer between takes the click

[2015-02-11 01:52:23] Dave_B_: i suppose strictly that's not checking the clickability of the element but rather how the click is sent *shrug*

[2015-02-11 10:06:18] joesmith: are you guys kicking them off from your binding language? for instance if i have selenium grid out there and my tests are python, using something like subprocess to run all the tests at once, which queue up on the grid?
[2015-02-11 10:06:35] joesmith: i've seen some stuff about testNG or jenkins as well
[2015-02-11 10:07:47] smccarthy: joesmith: well if you are talking about java, there is JUnit and TestNG (I use TestNG)
[2015-02-11 10:08:04] smccarthy: Than I have a jenkins job for each test suite, browser, browser version combination
[2015-02-11 10:10:02] joesmith: smccarthy: can you detail a bit more? when your jenkins job kicks off with browser combination1, does TestNG run all the tests in the suite at once?
[2015-02-11 10:10:04] jleyba: we're pretty similar to smccarthy, but also have infrastructure to break down test suites into multiple processes
[2015-02-11 10:10:24] jleyba: process 1 runs tests [1..N], process 2 runs [N+1..M], and so on
[2015-02-11 10:10:38] smccarthy: jleyba: sweet.
[2015-02-11 10:11:18] jleyba: junit4 based...filters are used to prune the test tree at runtime

[2015-02-11 10:12:31] joesmith: and will those parallel tests all go through Grid and run on separate servers? will they run multiple instances on the same server? both?
[2015-02-11 10:12:48] smccarthy: when we run our tests from jenkins, they are all pointed to the selenium grid hub
[2015-02-11 10:12:54] smccarthy: and the hub will distribute it

[2015-02-11 10:15:15] joesmith: gotcha. just trying to imagine how to build this in python. i know i can use nose to parallelize the unit tests which would basically run each test as a separate process

[2015-02-11 10:57:32] smccarthy: joesmith: Correct. Grid will just distribute the tests (however many you throw at it). You can limit how many each node can run though in the configuration (by default I think its 5?)
[2015-02-11 11:00:09] joesmith: smccarthy: yep, that makes sense. it seems that Jenkins relies on JUnit style tests to be able to parallelize them, so I think parallelizing the python tests in python itself and just having jenkins run that command would be the best for us

[2015-02-11 13:25:59] lukeis: but that's as one file...
[2015-02-11 13:26:20] sohlemac: page is not. It's part of the DOM. element is.
[2015-02-11 13:28:00] sohlemac: you are essentially injecting the javascript page.includeJs("uri_to_js_document") into the page you are on.
[2015-02-11 13:28:42] sohlemac: google dom scripting for more details.

[2015-02-11 13:32:54] jbone1: gotcha. yeah, sorry, don't mean to ask for a javascript tutorial. but this essentially means that it will load the other library *before* trying to read the javascript source on the page.
[2015-02-11 13:33:17] jbone1: damn. i'm still getting the same error:

[2015-02-11 14:09:41] AutomatedTester: and modal dialog support
[2015-02-11 14:09:50] jleyba: did you have a chance to check if webdriver.xpi <-> marionette communication was possible?
[2015-02-11 14:10:03] AutomatedTester: in theory it should be doable
[2015-02-11 14:10:16] AutomatedTester: at worst it would be the xpi opens a tcp connection and speaks through that

[2015-02-11 14:16:52] jleyba: AutomatedTester: awesome thanks
[2015-02-11 14:17:45] ato: The protocol isn't documented, but it basically looks like `length of packet:{json object}`.
[2015-02-11 14:19:56] jleyba: json rpc, eh?
[2015-02-11 14:20:10] ato: Pretty much.  It's fairly rudimentary.
[2015-02-11 14:20:37] jleyba: and the iedriver from MS is json based
[2015-02-11 14:20:42] ato: Unidirectional JSON RPC over TCP.
[2015-02-11 14:20:47] jleyba: internally chromedriver is json
[2015-02-11 14:21:29] ato: That's interesting.
[2015-02-11 14:21:40] ato: Re. IE.
[2015-02-11 14:21:45] *dimacus votes to replace JSON with SOAP'
[2015-02-11 14:22:23] ato: dimacus: My team at Opera was responsible for maintaining BTS extensions to the SOAP interface to JIRA.
[2015-02-11 14:22:29] ato: dimacus: I'd rather kill myself than go there again.
[2015-02-11 14:22:42] jleyba: ato: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn725045%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
[2015-02-11 14:22:44] dimacus: but SOAP is enterprise!
[2015-02-11 14:23:17] ato: Was that a requirement? (-:
[2015-02-11 14:23:35] *jleyba wonders why spec is restful http when api naturally maps to json'

[2015-02-11 14:24:30] lukeis: dimacus: don't drop the SOAP… or hold it, it doesn't matter… still will get raped in the asshole with it :)
[2015-02-11 14:24:52] *lukeis having a rough day…'
[2015-02-11 14:25:36] dimacus: lukeis: sorry to hear that… let's drink a beer, it always makes things better
[2015-02-11 14:25:42] jleyba: ato: still going to use ambiguous error code mapping
[2015-02-11 14:26:47] lukeis: dimacus: still fighting a bit of a cold too … so, sadly beer doesn't sound appealing
[2015-02-11 14:27:37] ato: jleyba: But they'll be consistent across drivers.  The status codes will give a rough indication of the problem is what we decided in Santa Clara IIRC.
[2015-02-11 14:28:27] ato: Isn't the problem that HTTP status codes aren't necessarily verbose enough to cover every possible error WebDriver encounters, and ignoring setting HTTP status codes for responses entirely would be un-RESTful?
[2015-02-11 14:28:35] nonny_t, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2015-02-11 14:28:43] jleyba: Yes, HTTP status code aren't verbose enough
[2015-02-11 14:28:46] emperorcezar, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-11 14:28:57] jleyba: and so what if it's un-RESTful? webdriver isn't a REST API... just likes to pretend it is
[2015-02-11 14:29:21] ato: I'd be happy with 200 for success and 410 or something for the rest.
[2015-02-11 14:29:51] ato: Just for reference, the discussion we had on this can be reviewed here: http://www.w3.org/2014/10/30-testing-minutes.html#item05
[2015-02-11 14:31:04] ato: I don't really have a strong preference on this.
[2015-02-11 14:33:58] jleyba: ato: I think it should be 200 for success, 4xx for bad requests, and 500 if something terrible happens
[2015-02-11 14:34:22] jleyba: basically, use HTTP to communicate status of transmitting the command.. use JSON to communicate actual command/response details
[2015-02-11 14:34:53] ato: I think that was pretty much what we landed on.
[2015-02-11 14:34:58] ato: It's just not made it into the spec yet.
