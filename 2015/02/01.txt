[2015-02-01 07:11:17] SlimJim: Hows your Selenium skills?
[2015-02-01 07:11:38] smccarthy: decent.... yours ?
[2015-02-01 07:12:23] SlimJim: Well the Internet Explorer Webdriver is causing me some issues
[2015-02-01 07:12:30] fabrice31, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-01 07:13:06] smccarthy: which version of IE ?
[2015-02-01 07:13:26] SlimJim: 11
[2015-02-01 07:14:13] smccarthy: whats the issue? Does it have to do with the KB3025390 update ? http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2014/12/windows-update-kb3025390-for-ie-11.html
[2015-02-01 07:14:54] SlimJim: I will have a look,
[2015-02-01 07:16:39] SlimJim: Oh, I see thanks, I guess IE 11, is not compatible we selenium webdriver

[2015-02-01 07:17:37] smccarthy: so people are saying if they removed that update, it worked again (I think)
[2015-02-01 07:18:45] SlimJim: Interesting, I wonder if I should use just IE 10, instead
[2015-02-01 07:19:25] smccarthy: Microsoft is aware of the IE11 KB3025390 issue : https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/1062093/installation-of-kb3025390-breaks-out-of-process-javascript-execution-in-ie11
[2015-02-01 07:20:53] SlimJim: that's very good info, smccarthy!
[2015-02-01 07:21:15] smccarthy: yup,... just waiting on microsoft to fix the issue
[2015-02-01 07:22:16] SlimJim: If remove the Update from my PC, can just do a Windows Update to get it back?
