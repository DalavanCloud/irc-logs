[2015-02-20 09:03:16] mister2: hey guys, is it possible to have a multiprocess python script that has two different browsers going? i wrote one, but it only loads firefoxes... code is here: https://gist.github.com/Ben-Grey/e84e3e800a4058c78b84
[2015-02-20 09:04:31] dude-x: sure
[2015-02-20 09:09:20] dude-x: mister2: you're creating tuples of strings i ithink
[2015-02-20 09:09:24] dude-x: that's why you're getting all firefox
[2015-02-20 09:09:32] mister2: yeah i just noticed that
[2015-02-20 09:09:36] mister2: thanks :)
[2015-02-20 09:09:54] dude-x: otherwise your code should work
[2015-02-20 09:10:39] dude-x: alternatively you can just write a dump script in pytohn and use bash to fire all of them at once
[2015-02-20 09:11:17] dude-x: you may want to also add a try/except to retry spawning a driver browser instance
[2015-02-20 09:11:31] dude-x: so that if there's a problem starting it will retry 5 times
[2015-02-20 09:11:35] dude-x: up to 5 times
[2015-02-20 09:11:55] mister2: that's a good idea

[2015-02-20 09:15:32] mister2: dude-x: here's a quick one, is there "wait until loaded" function you're familiar with?
[2015-02-20 09:15:47] dude-x: there's no generic one
[2015-02-20 09:16:04] mister2: mk

[2015-02-20 09:16:07] mister2: guess i'll live with sleep
[2015-02-20 09:16:10] dude-x: becaues every webpage is unique on how it loads its resources
[2015-02-20 09:16:11] dude-x: BUT
[2015-02-20 09:16:14] swampdragons, leaving. (#selenium)
[2015-02-20 09:16:22] dude-x: there's a WebDriverWait function
[2015-02-20 09:16:34] dude-x: and if you know the element that is last to load for a particular page
[2015-02-20 09:16:42] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-20 09:16:49] dude-x: you can use the ExpectedConditions class to wait for that element to be present
[2015-02-20 09:17:02] mister2: oh yeah, that works
[2015-02-20 09:17:34] dude-x: you will want to wait like 30 seconds or 60 seconds, because if you are writing an ad-hoc load test
[2015-02-20 09:17:50] dude-x: as you make more connections, it will slow down in response time
[2015-02-20 09:17:57] dude-x: so the webdriver wait should have a generous wait time
[2015-02-20 09:18:00] p0deje, quitting. (Quit: p0deje)
[2015-02-20 09:18:12] dude-x: it's a polling wait, so it will wait up to the timeout you specified

[2015-02-20 09:19:07] WhereIsMySpoon: webdriverwaits and fluent waits are what you want
[2015-02-20 09:19:11] WhereIsMySpoon: not system sleeps
[2015-02-20 09:19:14] WhereIsMySpoon: or thread sleeps
[2015-02-20 09:19:14] mister2: yeah, i've had some issues with it xD
[2015-02-20 09:19:25] mister2: looking it up in the docs now
[2015-02-20 09:20:01] dude-x: technically a webdriver wait or fluent wait is a sleep, but it polls based on a condition, which is what you want to do than a blunt sleep
[2015-02-20 09:20:08] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2015-02-20 09:21:28] mister2: so

[2015-02-20 09:22:18] WhereIsMySpoon: no
[2015-02-20 09:22:22] WhereIsMySpoon: its the time it waits until it doesnt find it
[2015-02-20 09:22:38] WhereIsMySpoon: the default time between polls is 0.5s iirc
[2015-02-20 09:22:48] WhereIsMySpoon: for webdriverwaits
[2015-02-20 09:23:32] dude-x: 10 is the time until it times out, the polling interval is by default every half second (0.5)

[2015-02-20 09:26:25] mister2: i've been looking at seleniumhq
[2015-02-20 09:26:26] mister2: o.0
[2015-02-20 09:26:50] WhereIsMySpoon: that has tutorials on how to use selenium and its blocks
[2015-02-20 09:26:59] WhereIsMySpoon: the apidocs will have specific implementation level details
[2015-02-20 09:27:21] WhereIsMySpoon: seleniumhq is a good place to start :)
[2015-02-20 09:27:32] WhereIsMySpoon: then if you need api help go to those links

[2015-02-20 09:32:12] mister2: hm
[2015-02-20 09:32:13] mister2: alright
[2015-02-20 09:32:19] WhereIsMySpoon: mister2: that's why you wrap it in a wait so that if it takes a couple seconds to load you dont throw the exception
[2015-02-20 09:32:36] mister2: right
[2015-02-20 09:32:37] mister2: i was thinking
[2015-02-20 09:32:48] mister2: i could use that in the wait
[2015-02-20 09:33:15] mister2: element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(lambda x: x.find_element_by_id(“someId”))
[2015-02-20 09:33:33] mister2: so i could use x.find_elemtn_by_link_text() in place of by_id
[2015-02-20 09:33:35] WhereIsMySpoon: until needs an expectedcondition
[2015-02-20 09:33:44] WhereIsMySpoon: at least in the java bindings, dont know about python
[2015-02-20 09:34:13] mister2: i'm pretty sure this will work, but i'm a noob so i'm going to try it :)
[2015-02-20 09:34:30] WhereIsMySpoon: go for it lol
[2015-02-20 09:34:37] WhereIsMySpoon: only way you find out is to try
[2015-02-20 09:34:43] WhereIsMySpoon: to find out*
[2015-02-20 09:35:24] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: my patch still has status new even after 2 months of being there :p

[2015-02-20 09:39:52] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: (Also next time you submit a patch, please use `git format-patch` instead of `git diff`.)

[2015-02-20 09:42:23] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: Also real they are easier to apply.

[2015-02-20 09:43:30] jleyba: ato: pretty sure no one would object to moving to github at this point
[2015-02-20 09:43:35] jleyba: someone just needs to sign up for the work

[2015-02-20 09:44:13] ato: Tempting!
[2015-02-20 09:44:35] WhereIsMySpoon: just dump all the below critical issues and if theyre really important people will recreate them
[2015-02-20 09:44:37] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-02-20 09:44:51] ato: Well that's not an entirely bad idea.
[2015-02-20 09:44:57] jleyba: we use two issue priorities: medium and low

[2015-02-20 11:27:29] mister2: is there a reason this:     WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(lambda x: driver.find_element_by_link_text('Library'))
[2015-02-20 11:27:29] mister2:  wouldn't return true if this returns true if i use a system sleep? driver.find_element_by_link_text('Library').click()
[2015-02-20 11:28:34] *lukeis doesn't understand the question, can you rephrase?'
[2015-02-20 11:28:57] mister2: sure
[2015-02-20 11:29:50] mister2: when i run  driver.find_element_by_link_text('Library').click() after the page has loaded it clicks the link as it should, i learned this running my code with a time.sleep(5) to let the page load
[2015-02-20 11:30:05] mister2: but when i use  WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(lambda x: driver.find_element_by_link_text('Library')) it times out
[2015-02-20 11:30:20] mister2: even though i can manually scroll to the bottom and see the link as loaded and existing
[2015-02-20 11:30:38] mister2: also tried lambda driver: driver...... and lambda x: x.....
[2015-02-20 11:31:43] farlan, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-02-20 11:32:42] lukeis: the lambda variable should be consistent and not one from the global scope (ideally)… but that doesn't really matter here since you likely just have one instance of 'driver'….  so if you do a time.sleep(5) and then find the element / click it works?
[2015-02-20 11:32:59] mister2: yep, it does
[2015-02-20 11:33:23] mister2: what should the lambda variable be? x is fine? or does it need to reference the driver?
[2015-02-20 11:33:44] lukeis: can you :gist some more of the code to understand? like showing the way it works with sleep (and the line before it) and the way it doesn't work with the lambda / webdriverwait
[2015-02-20 11:33:48] mister2: my setup is multiprocess, so there are multiple instances running if that affects this (which i presume not)
[2015-02-20 11:34:03] lukeis: the lambda variable name can be whatever you want it to be
[2015-02-20 11:34:16] lukeis: the driver is passed into the constructor of the WebDriverWait

[2015-02-20 11:34:52] mister2: that's my current code
[2015-02-20 11:35:01] mister2: there's a revision in there somewhere with sleep

[2015-02-20 11:41:42] lukeis: mister2: heh, that stacktrace kind of sucks because the multiprocessing hides where you're getting the real exception...
[2015-02-20 11:41:45] mister2: hm, maybe i should be using implicit waits instead?
[2015-02-20 11:41:48] mister2: YUP

[2015-02-20 11:42:01] lukeis: can you run it without multiprocessing at first :)
[2015-02-20 11:42:38] lukeis: basically you can't even tell if it's failing on firefox or chrome ;)

[2015-02-20 11:51:27] farlan, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-20 11:52:22] mister2: so i guess what i'm really asking is why https://gist.github.com/Ben-Grey/e84e3e800a4058c78b84#file-gistfile1-py-L12 doesn't return true because time.sleep(.1) is enough time to load the page for https://gist.github.com/Ben-Grey/e84e3e800a4058c78b84#file-gistfile1-py-L37 to not throw an error
[2015-02-20 11:54:11] lukeis: but it's failing here? https://gist.github.com/Ben-Grey/e84e3e800a4058c78b84#file-gistfile1-py-L24
