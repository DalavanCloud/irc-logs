[2015-02-25 06:54:58] joesmith: yeah that all makes sense, but i'm having trouble if the client running the actual test is inside the firewall, the grid server can't get back to it. does the grid server talk on port 4444 back to the client too? would you need to forward port 4444 back into that client?
[2015-02-25 06:55:22] joesmith: not talking about the nodes at all, just the test client to node communication
[2015-02-25 06:55:46] joesmith: i guess i thought it would be a persistent connection. i guess this is why saucelabs has sauce connect

[2015-02-25 07:01:19] joesmith: thats similar to what i'm testing. my client running a test is inside the network, but the grid server is out in aws
[2015-02-25 07:03:37] sircapsalot: so your test client (i.e. your computer) wants to send the test requests to your grid which is out in aws, which gets routed to saucelabs?
[2015-02-25 07:03:52] joesmith: theres no saucelabs
[2015-02-25 07:04:02] joesmith: just my computer sending tests to my grid which is in aws
[2015-02-25 07:04:12] sircapsalot: where are the nodes
[2015-02-25 07:04:24] sircapsalot: your grid needs nodes to run tests on
[2015-02-25 07:04:51] joesmith: yes i know, the nodes are all communicating with the grid find. the tests work fine if i run them on the grid server to localhost

[2015-02-25 08:50:09] jimevans: sorry it's not what you wanted to hear. selenium is a hammer. getting http headers of requests from the browser is a screw.
[2015-02-25 08:50:10] jimevans: :)
[2015-02-25 08:50:18] trevorj: Is there a way to get selenium to set PROXY_HOST before starting firefox/chrome
[2015-02-25 08:50:27] trevorj: It needs to be handled per session
[2015-02-25 08:50:39] trevorj: We use different proxies to get to different locations based on what app we're testing
[2015-02-25 08:51:02] trevorj: We also utilize basic auth for said proxies, which makes it not as easy to configure apparently
[2015-02-25 08:52:03] trevorj: Using the PROXY_HOST environment variable we can include the proxy authentication parameters, but this would have to be exported to the firefox process before selenium starts it per session

[2015-02-25 09:06:29] ato: The release is pending on whether we want to drop Firefox native events or not AFAIK.

[2015-02-25 09:07:07] lukeis: yesterday simon seemed to agree that we should release without native events
[2015-02-25 09:07:08] ato: I pinged him about it earlier today, so we'll see when he turns up I guess.
[2015-02-25 09:07:23] jdowns: ok, so do you think the timeline might be less than a month?
[2015-02-25 09:07:24] ato: OK, because I think all of the remaining pieces are in place right?
[2015-02-25 09:07:26] lukeis: since no one is willing to work on fixing native events properly and he doesn't seem to have the time

[2015-02-25 10:05:57] joesmith: since there's more people here now, anyone know if there's ports that need to be opened for a grid server to be able to respond back to a test inside a router/firewall?
[2015-02-25 10:08:28] dude-x: 4444 at the minimum
[2015-02-25 10:08:30] dude-x: and i tihnk 5555
[2015-02-25 10:08:57] sircapsalot: still haven't figured that issue out?  :/
[2015-02-25 10:09:08] joesmith: nope
[2015-02-25 10:09:20] joesmith: so does that mean you can't have multiple clients sharing the same public IP trying to connect to a grid/
[2015-02-25 10:10:10] joesmith: seems like test->grid isn't a stateful tcp connection?
[2015-02-25 10:14:03] sircapsalot: you should be able to do client -> grid -> nodeN  with no problem
[2015-02-25 10:15:26] joesmith: yeah i'm testing two different clients behind two different IPs, both timeout creating the webdriver instance. one mac, one linux. with both, the grid see it, and launches the app on the node, but the client never gets a response

[2015-02-25 10:17:47] dude-x: one thing that affected me was that I had a VMWare virtual network adapter
[2015-02-25 10:18:02] dude-x: you may wnat to run the Jar with --host ip_of_your_machine
[2015-02-25 10:18:02] joesmith: my grid node is an aws instance
[2015-02-25 10:18:12] jleyba: is it possible to test if something is running under xvfb vs. a real display?
[2015-02-25 10:18:12] dude-x: well if it has muliple network adapters
[2015-02-25 10:18:16] joesmith: maybe it's trying to use the private ip to talk to the clients...
[2015-02-25 10:18:19] joesmith: let me try that
[2015-02-25 10:18:25] dude-x: the server may bind to the wrong ip
[2015-02-25 10:19:01] joesmith: well it's definitely running on 0.0.0.0 because i can see it from the clients, but maybe it's trying to return back on the wrong IP
[2015-02-25 10:19:17] jleyba: disable ipv6 if you're using it
[2015-02-25 10:19:34] jleyba: selenium doesn't behave well with ipv6

[2015-02-25 10:30:22] jimevans: jleyba: so how come we decided to not do the extension install anymore? i assume it's because apple changed the extension stuff somehow in safari.vCurrent.
[2015-02-25 10:30:34] jimevans: but i don't remember the conversation per se.
[2015-02-25 10:31:01] jleyba: jimevans: installing an extension requires updating the keychain
[2015-02-25 10:31:06] jimevans: aha.
[2015-02-25 10:31:10] jimevans: that'd do it.
[2015-02-25 10:31:16] jleyba: well, we can "install" it, but it needs to be enabled via the keychain
[2015-02-25 10:32:04] jimevans: so essentially we do for safari what we worked very hard *not* to do for IE.
[2015-02-25 10:33:31] jimevans: there are some things that would probably be easier if the IE driver were a browser extension, but IE browser extensions require installation/elevation, so we hack-hack-hackity-hacked to find other ways to do what was required to drive IE.
[2015-02-25 10:34:08] jleyba: Safari extensions are like Chrome extensions, they're JS apps
[2015-02-25 10:34:19] jleyba: not the same as an IE plug-in.
[2015-02-25 10:34:32] jleyba: users don't need special permissions to install the extension
