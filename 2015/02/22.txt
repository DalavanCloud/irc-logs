[2015-02-22 14:10:22] ato: jumanji: In WebDriver, interaction commands are implemented differently for each browser.
[2015-02-22 14:10:52] jumanji: is it possible to say run a webdriver test in javascript on my browser?
[2015-02-22 14:11:01] ato: jumanji: Some commands call down to a library of JS atoms that are shared across browsers.
[2015-02-22 14:11:12] jumanji: where can I find that
[2015-02-22 14:12:03] jumanji: im looking to build a chrome extension that will run webdriver test
[2015-02-22 14:12:07] jumanji: locally
[2015-02-22 14:12:09] ato: The synthesised WebDriver implementation in JS is here: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/master/javascript/atoms
[2015-02-22 14:12:40] ato: Well to properly implement WebDriver, you need to control the browser from OOP.
[2015-02-22 14:13:02] ato: So the WebDriver-in-JS implementation we have won't be 100%.
[2015-02-22 14:13:03] jumanji: I see
[2015-02-22 14:13:18] smccarthy, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-02-22 14:13:21] ato: But it might be good enough for what you want to do.
[2015-02-22 14:13:34] jumanji: where can I find that js implementation?
[2015-02-22 14:14:19] jumanji: ato: I found this https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs#Controlling_the_Host_Browser
[2015-02-22 14:14:37] jumanji: but not sure if that is what I think it does
[2015-02-22 14:15:47] ato: That's an in-document JS client that communicates with a WebDriver server controlling the browser it gets run from.
[2015-02-22 14:15:55] ato: Using XHR.
[2015-02-22 14:17:06] ato: You might want to ask jleyba about that when he comes online.
[2015-02-22 14:17:14] jumanji: ok
[2015-02-22 14:17:24] ato: I have to run now, but I'll be back tomorrow morning.
