[2015-02-12 08:46:47] ato: You're right: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/firefox-driver/js/wdsession.js#L116
[2015-02-12 08:47:01] ato: FirefoxDriver's default is -1, which for it means “infinite”.
[2015-02-12 08:48:24] dude-x: which is not a bad thing because i've actually written a script that would kick off an API call via a URL that would take 20-30 minutes to complete

[2015-02-12 08:50:46] dude-x: Dave_B_: only weird thing was that version of webdriver would sometimes call "get" twice
[2015-02-12 08:50:53] dude-x: so TWO Jobs would get kicked off and the webserver will die

[2015-02-12 09:03:44] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: I'm not going to argue with you, but the IRC protocol doesn't really have any concept of “URL”.  Hence it's the UA's choice whether to turn them into clickable links, and I think it's rather unspecified how to parse an URL as part of English, especially when prose interferes with the semantics of a URL.

[2015-02-12 10:37:38] smccarthy: the first one, shows how to change the log level for the hub and node logs (for selenium). The second one shows how to change the log level for the grid_extras logs.
[2015-02-12 10:37:54] smccarthy: I just tested it a little, so def might be missing something... hopefully someone else can check more
[2015-02-12 10:38:00] smccarthy: to see if it works for them that is.
[2015-02-12 10:41:33] phasze: smccarthy: and if I wanted to disable logging entirely?
[2015-02-12 10:41:57] smccarthy: for log4j, use the level = OFF
[2015-02-12 10:42:07] smccarthy: sorry, thats backwards, for java.util.logging
[2015-02-12 10:42:23] phasze: ah yeah, just saw that in the link's link
[2015-02-12 10:42:28] phasze: cool cool
[2015-02-12 10:42:29] smccarthy: actually both have a level = OFF
[2015-02-12 10:42:32] smccarthy: I havent tested that :)

[2015-02-12 10:43:14] smccarthy: yea sure, mvn clean install -DskipTests is what I do

[2015-02-12 15:21:19] jentron_: Is it possible to get selenium to choose a user cert for login authorization? Right now my tests are pausing as firefox waits for me to choose an identity...
[2015-02-12 15:22:14] AutomatedTester: jentron_: could you install it into a firefox profile and then get that profile used?
[2015-02-12 15:23:21] jentron_: Yes, I've got my test profile used
[2015-02-12 15:24:57] jentron_: And it would be a pain, but I could generate separate profiles for each user I need to use, but it would be better to just choose the correct certificate on the fly
[2015-02-12 15:25:15] joesmith: just fyi if anyone was reading my stuff, it was because i wasn't specifying a version in my desired capabilities. without it, the grid server just matches whatever the first node in the grid is, instead of trying to match the other desired capabilities. even though version isnt required. that seems like a bug

[2015-02-12 16:10:02] AutomatedTester: I dont know what libary you are using but my guess, and this is because I dont have much info to work on, is that you are passing a string when it's not expecting one
