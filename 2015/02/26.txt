[2015-02-26 09:09:36] ato: So we're picking a random port by binding a socket to port 0, which returns a random free one.

[2015-02-26 09:30:47] lukeis: useful spam… but yes, more spam
[2015-02-26 09:30:57] jleyba: we forked WebDriverException.java here. All that "extra info" stuff is commented out
[2015-02-26 09:32:16] ato: The extra information in WebDriverException.java is pretty pointless.
[2015-02-26 09:32:30] lukeis: typically i can infer upon the used locator based on the stack trace… although dynamic locators can often are hard to find what was actually used…

[2015-02-26 09:49:29] WhereIsMySpoon: jleyba: lots of stuff about electricity :p
[2015-02-26 09:49:30] lukeis: as opposed to AC (alternating current) circuits :)
[2015-02-26 09:49:32] WhereIsMySpoon: got it though
[2015-02-26 09:49:47] lukeis: AC — plug into the wall… DC — batteries
[2015-02-26 09:49:55] jleyba: context though.. if its a law content, might have been a reference to dc circuit courts?
[2015-02-26 09:50:01] jleyba: law context*
[2015-02-26 09:50:17] lukeis: indeed
[2015-02-26 09:50:27] lukeis: District of Columbia  (aka Washington DC)
[2015-02-26 09:52:18] lukeis: how lovely that this is considering this legislation that affects the entire wold… but really only care about the U.S. and will only hear arguments basically from the U.S.
[2015-02-26 09:52:50] jleyba: the fcc's proposal will most likely pass
[2015-02-26 09:53:02] lukeis: that's what my understanding was too
[2015-02-26 09:53:05] jleyba: whether congress tries to undo that by changing the law is another matter
[2015-02-26 09:53:19] lukeis: and will be a legal battle over the course of the next few years to see if it's upheld
[2015-02-26 09:53:26] WhereIsMySpoon: jleyba: thats what oreilly was saying
[2015-02-26 09:53:32] WhereIsMySpoon: that it wouldnt hold up
[2015-02-26 09:53:37] jleyba: like i said, Obama just needs to come out against net neutrality
[2015-02-26 09:53:52] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: that's a republican stand point… i think it may :)
[2015-02-26 09:54:00] WhereIsMySpoon: jleyba: eh?
[2015-02-26 09:54:12] lukeis: against?
[2015-02-26 09:54:14] WhereIsMySpoon: why do you keep saying that :p
[2015-02-26 09:54:42] lukeis: jleyba: did you mean s/against/for/ ?? :)
[2015-02-26 09:54:50] jleyba: against :)
[2015-02-26 09:55:04] WhereIsMySpoon: jleyba:?
[2015-02-26 09:55:05] jimevans: lukeis, WhereIsMySpoon: because then the majority republican congress would *have* to take the opposite stance, because obstructionism.
[2015-02-26 09:55:12] WhereIsMySpoon: oh i see lol
[2015-02-26 09:55:14] jleyba: jimevans wins

[2015-02-26 09:56:38] lukeis: which is the likely path over the next two years… with the stupid half of the country putting all those republicans in congress :)
[2015-02-26 09:57:21] jimevans: our political system is highly effed.
[2015-02-26 09:57:33] sircapsalot: thats just politics in general.  effed

[2015-02-26 09:59:33] jimevans: but the current atmosphere where compromise is a dirty word, and where none but the most extreme viewpoints can get on the ballot because primaries, that's what's effed.
[2015-02-26 09:59:43] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: quite
[2015-02-26 10:00:00] sircapsalot: indeed...
[2015-02-26 10:00:07] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: also changing your view isnt allowed

[2015-02-26 10:00:51] jimevans: gerrymandered districts where the same party gets elected time after time doesn't help either.
[2015-02-26 10:01:14] lukeis: don't make me wish Occupy comes back ;)
[2015-02-26 10:01:25] lukeis: that's where this is heading...
[2015-02-26 10:01:30] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2015-02-26 10:01:36] WhereIsMySpoon: occupy didnt really do squat
[2015-02-26 10:01:42] jimevans: occupy was a flawed movement.
[2015-02-26 10:01:51] sircapsalot: well awareness maybe

[2015-02-26 10:58:46] ppeng: what should I do now? wait for 2.45.0?
[2015-02-26 10:59:08] lukeis: that's one option
[2015-02-26 10:59:37] jleyba: could build yourself a new jar from source.
[2015-02-26 10:59:51] lukeis: or download it from our ci...

[2015-02-26 12:20:23] skywalker: hey guys, how do i get the Nome (id) field in this html http://pastebin.com/qVMZRRW7 ? i tried the following with no success: String nomez = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//form[@class='fltes']/table/tbody/tr/td[1]")).getText();  OR String nomez = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//form[@id='formSalvarContato']/div/table/tbody/tr/td[1]")).getText(); OR String cpf = driver.findElement(By.id("Nome")).getText();
[2015-02-26 12:20:31] skywalker: could someone please help me?
[2015-02-26 12:21:30] bbark123: try .getAttr("value);
[2015-02-26 12:21:37] jleyba:  skywalker By.cssSelector("#Nome")?
[2015-02-26 12:22:59] bbark123: sorry, typo: webElement.getAttribute("value");
[2015-02-26 12:23:11] skywalker: all try that folks
[2015-02-26 12:23:23] skywalker: what is wrong with my xpath? i am still trying to figure out how it does work
[2015-02-26 12:24:08] jleyba: for starters its not efficient. if the element you want has an id, use the id
[2015-02-26 12:24:48] skywalker: i see. i tried what i thought was the simplest way which is By.id("Nome")
[2015-02-26 12:25:52] skywalker: jleyba: this By.cssSelector("#Nome")? did not work
[2015-02-26 12:25:56] skywalker: i'll try the getAttr now
[2015-02-26 12:26:03] bbark123: you are probably able to get the element just fine, but i've run into the same issue using getText() on a input field. driver.findElement(By.id("Nome")).getAttribute("value"); should work
[2015-02-26 12:26:10] seljenkinsbot: Yippee, build fixed!

[2015-02-26 14:45:16] jleyba: technically, but I don't remember the password to login
[2015-02-26 14:45:27] ato: That was exactly what I was going to ask you. d-:
[2015-02-26 14:45:34] ato: I can't remember my username.
[2015-02-26 14:45:50] juangj: ato: seva will probably be back in ~45 minutes
[2015-02-26 14:46:35] ato: Hah, I remembered!
[2015-02-26 14:46:42] ato: It had to do with my old LDAP username at Opera.
[2015-02-26 14:47:21] ato: PSA: I'm going to disable the Opera jobs in the CI.
[2015-02-26 14:48:04] ato: And by disable I mean delete.
[2015-02-26 14:48:07] threexk: trying to build, I get "Could not reserve enough space for 2097152KB object heap".  What is wrong?
[2015-02-26 14:48:20] threexk: I have 3GB memory free, 5GB disk space
[2015-02-26 14:48:47] ato: threexk: It's failing to allocate ~2G of memory.
[2015-02-26 14:49:04] ato: You probably have too little memory to build Selenium.
[2015-02-26 14:49:42] threexk: strange, Windows says I have 3GB free
[2015-02-26 14:50:04] ato: Well available RAM isn't an exact science.
[2015-02-26 14:50:06] threexk: oh maybe that 2GB it is trying to allocate is on top of other memory needs
[2015-02-26 14:50:20] threexk: OK I will add more memory, thanks

[2015-02-26 14:58:42] threexk: ato: tried that initially but couldn't find what I wanted (WebDriver Python bindings).  It was suggested to do 'go firefox py_install'
[2015-02-26 14:58:56] ato: Ah, OK.
[2015-02-26 14:58:58] threexk: ato: I changed 2048M to 1024M in go.bat and it seems to be building now
[2015-02-26 14:59:08] threexk: not sure if it'll work
[2015-02-26 14:59:13] ato: To… 1G less?
[2015-02-26 14:59:21] ato: OK.
[2015-02-26 14:59:27] ato: Maybe it's just got to do with JVM allocation.
[2015-02-26 14:59:32] ato: The build system we use is crazy.
[2015-02-26 15:00:02] jleyba: ato the Xmx jvm args need to removed for java8 anyway (assuming Selenium ever switches to it)
[2015-02-26 15:00:05] threexk: I could only increase the RAM to 3.5GB in this VM (32-bit Windows limitation?), which wasn't enough
[2015-02-26 15:00:15] ato: jleyba: Indeed.
[2015-02-26 15:00:24] joshin4colours, leaving. (#selenium)
[2015-02-26 15:00:34] ato: Well it's meant to be buildable on Windows too.
[2015-02-26 15:00:36] threexk: does JDK8 work?  that is what I am using
[2015-02-26 15:00:43] ato: JDK8 works.
[2015-02-26 15:00:53] threexk: OK, cool
[2015-02-26 15:01:20] ato: jleyba: So when are you going to rewrite the server in Go? (-:
[2015-02-26 15:01:39] jleyba: ato: I actually have one started somewhere
[2015-02-26 15:01:48] ato: You have?
[2015-02-26 15:01:48] ato: \o/
[2015-02-26 15:02:28] jleyba: Do you mean for a shared Marionette/IEDriverServer platform, or something to replace the standalone Java server?
[2015-02-26 15:02:36] ato: The latter.
[2015-02-26 15:03:02] ato: (We're writing a httpd for Marionette in Rust, but that's primarily meant for the wpt tests.)
[2015-02-26 15:03:35] jleyba: For the standalone server I think the plan was to stick with Java, but switch to Netty
[2015-02-26 15:03:51] ato: OK |-:
[2015-02-26 15:03:59] jleyba: I'd be in favor of a lighter weight server written in Go, but I'm not messing with any grid stuff
[2015-02-26 15:04:43] dude-x: one day i would like to write the server stuff in erlang

[2015-02-26 15:06:06] dude-x: but the only downside is that people can't write their own extensions easily
