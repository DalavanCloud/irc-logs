[2015-02-05 07:47:52] mtellez: Hi, i'm following the basic example of WebDriver (http://pastebin.com/MmpLTP7N), it seems to work but the firefox window close almost immediately. If I put a setTimeout then the window stays open for a moment, but how can I leave the window open? removing driver.quit() do not help.

[2015-02-05 07:49:46] WhereIsMySpoon: odd, removing the .quit() should stop it quitting

[2015-02-05 07:53:52] joshin4colours: if you're interested in *viewing* the test, you could put some waits in there

[2015-02-05 07:59:11] joshin4colours: mtellez: you could use setTimeout
[2015-02-05 07:59:39] joshin4colours: normally, I'd recommend a sleep statement (ONLY for initial viewing purposes)

[2015-02-05 08:09:10] dude-x: dubner: typically i would do line by line, but if i do multiple imports it's on one line from x import a, b, c, e
[2015-02-05 08:09:48] dubner: dude-x: yeah that is good too, think I must have been in a full on pep8 mode
[2015-02-05 08:09:59] dude-x: one thing i do differently for selenium waits is use a global default, and i can override on a individual basis
[2015-02-05 08:10:08] jimevans: dubner: i don't, but that would require running multiple simulators on the same machine simultaneously, and i'm not sure the ios simulator allows that.

[2015-02-05 08:57:56] jimevans: ato: yep. that link is to my bug report.
[2015-02-05 08:58:16] ato: Okay, so it's not certain the fix makes it into the Window update?
[2015-02-05 08:58:20] jimevans: and the official word is that the fix is "on track" to be included in the february update.
[2015-02-05 08:58:25] jimevans: but i'm a realist.
[2015-02-05 08:58:41] jimevans: if a late regression is found in testing before the update goes live, it'll be pulled.
[2015-02-05 08:58:52] ato: Understand.
[2015-02-05 09:00:06] jimevans: i'm optimistic.

[2015-02-05 09:01:48] jimevans: yep, sorry, i've been asked to keep internal sausage-making comments under wraps.
[2015-02-05 09:02:22] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: lol
[2015-02-05 09:02:24] *AutomatedTester LOLs so hard'
[2015-02-05 09:02:50] AutomatedTester: I think from now on I should tell the marionette team to keep quiet about things
[2015-02-05 09:03:12] jimevans: hey, i like thejohnjansen, and i value his friendship. i'm not going to jeopardize that :)
[2015-02-05 09:03:20] AutomatedTester: since we get passive aggressive comments all the time
[2015-02-05 09:03:33] jimevans: AutomatedTester: guilty as charged.
[2015-02-05 09:03:34] AutomatedTester: but MS say, please keep quiet and there is hardly a peep
[2015-02-05 09:03:36] jimevans: sorry mate.

[2015-02-05 09:05:05] ato: Although Mozilla does have one as well.
[2015-02-05 09:05:16] jimevans: it's not a "please keep quiet," so much as a "you agreed to keep quiet about this stuff."
[2015-02-05 09:09:58] jimevans: AutomatedTester: but re: marionette, would it help if i stopped caring about it?
[2015-02-05 09:10:32] jimevans: because i make passive-aggressive comments because i care, and want the project to be successful.

[2015-02-05 11:36:12] joesmith: what's best practice for writing many tests that require logging in? have a login and logout method before and after each test? is it worth the extra time to be able to run tests individually and cleanly?
[2015-02-05 11:38:32] jimevans: joesmith: don't do your login through the UI.
[2015-02-05 11:41:25] joesmith: jimevans: right, we can use the API and do a shared cookie. is it still best practice to do this before and after each test?
[2015-02-05 11:41:30] dude-x: joesmith: have a login page object, and then have a login method that will first logout, then login; also use webdriver.get to jump to the section you want to test
[2015-02-05 11:42:20] dude-x: alternatively have a test hook to make login easier, or jump to a particular feature and skip all the prerequisites
[2015-02-05 11:43:09] dude-x: at one company, they had accounts that dind't require passwords to login, and these accounts only worked in a "QA" environment and not on prod
[2015-02-05 11:45:57] joesmith: dude-x: so are you saying only login once for all the tests? or for all of them?
[2015-02-05 11:46:27] dude-x: joesmith: i think it's a matter of taste/preference, however I feel that only setting up the browser, closing the browser is for test start up and tear down; i have logging in as a part of the test; you don't want to logout in the tear down if the test fails
[2015-02-05 11:47:04] jimevans: see, this is why i'm always leery of the term "best practices." what's "best" in one environment, isn't in another.
[2015-02-05 11:47:05] dude-x: joesmith: i login for every test but not in the setup, in the test itself. the login will logout first to handle cases of a prior session failing
[2015-02-05 11:48:19] dude-x: i like to have a single browser session for my tests
[2015-02-05 11:48:33] dude-x: so that one browser is always open and it logs in and out repeatedly as tests are ran
[2015-02-05 11:49:03] aCodinMan, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-05 11:49:15] dude-x: however i also have the option to have every test case start a new browser instance (and terminate it when its done)
[2015-02-05 11:49:24] dude-x: which i use when i run against sauce for example
[2015-02-05 11:49:38] dude-x: or if I had to run against Microsoft's Internet Explorer
[2015-02-05 11:50:07] joesmith: dude-x: thanks, that's what i thought
