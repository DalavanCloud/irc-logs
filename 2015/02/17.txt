[2015-02-17 08:20:45] antsanto_: Is it possible to get the driver references that are created/used from the Selenium Grid?
[2015-02-17 08:21:05] WhereIsMySpoon: or am i misunderstanding what you're saying ato

[2015-02-17 08:23:27] ato: WhereIsMySpoon: I have bad experiences with services that aren't on the same subnet, i.e. which needs to talk to some remote server via internet.  It's just not a deterministic environment, and debugging intermittent networking related issues is a PITA.
[2015-02-17 08:23:35] ato: sohlemac: I'm not your manager (-:
[2015-02-17 08:24:41] Dave_B_: I've yet to work on an app that was totally local so it's never been an option to date for me
[2015-02-17 08:25:35] sohlemac: ato: lol, I concede that point. Things would probably be a lot different here if you were.
[2015-02-17 08:25:39] jentron_: Since our dev database != test database, testing the deployed location helps find bad deploy procedures
[2015-02-17 08:26:16] ato: Dave_B_: Well you can instrument your test setup in such a way that you spin up the services in the same data centre or on subnet connections that reduce latency and gives you some level of hermetic guarantee.
[2015-02-17 08:26:19] Dave_B_: that said, quite often the non-local stuff isn't accessed from browser machine itself anyway
[2015-02-17 08:26:26] jimevans: to be fair, it seems that jentron_'s question can be stated without any relation to selenium whatsoever.
[2015-02-17 08:26:27] jimevans: :)
[2015-02-17 08:27:06] ato: sohlemac: (-:  I used to be a manager, and I didn't enjoy it very much.
[2015-02-17 08:27:07] sohlemac: but jimevans, we wanted to pick apart a blanket statement from ato!
[2015-02-17 08:27:33] ato: jentron_: Sure, you make a valid point.
[2015-02-17 08:27:48] jimevans: sohlemac: i'm not included as part of the antecedent to the pronoun "we" in your last sentence. :)
[2015-02-17 08:27:53] jentron_: True, but I don't really care ff phones home when I start it once a day... but under the selenium environment I'm starting it fresh for every test
[2015-02-17 08:27:58] fabrice31, quitting. (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[2015-02-17 08:28:01] ato: jentron_: There are of course different types of testing; but running your full set of functional tests against a live deployment doesn't sound like a winning strategy.
[2015-02-17 08:28:33] jimevans: jentron_: then my response to your question would be another question: "how would you manually prevent firefox from phoning home?"
[2015-02-17 08:29:05] jentron_: ato, at this point I'm just looking at running some simple smoke tests ... Can I log in as varous users and navigate around the site.
[2015-02-17 08:29:11] jimevans: once you answer that question, the "how do i get firefox to not phone home when using webdriver" question is easy to answer.
[2015-02-17 08:30:12] jentron_: jimevans: true. I just thought this might be something that was fairly common to selenium users since we start FF so often...
[2015-02-17 08:30:16] *jimevans is still on island time'
[2015-02-17 08:30:25] simonstewart, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-17 08:30:34] ato: jentron_: Makes sense.  I was perhaps generalising a little bit; no situation is the same.

[2015-02-17 08:31:00] ato: jimevans: How was das boot?

[2015-02-17 08:32:09] ato: jentron_: You're probably looking for the toolkit.telemetry.enabled pref BTW.
[2015-02-17 08:32:29] jimevans: g'day simonstewart!
[2015-02-17 08:32:37] jimevans: where in the world is simonstewart today?
[2015-02-17 08:33:01] ato: jimevans: Also there's the whole datareporting.* subsection which has lots of related things.
[2015-02-17 08:33:36] antsanto_: Why we couldnt able to find the PID of browsers opened in Java? Any reasons behind it?
[2015-02-17 08:33:40] sirfilip, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2015-02-17 08:34:02] jimevans: antsanto_: that's a very good question. though with today
[2015-02-17 08:34:30] jimevans: though with today's multiprocess browser architecture, it's increasingly difficult to know exactly *which* process your driver started.
[2015-02-17 08:34:33] ato: antsanto_: OSes have different concepts of what a PID means.  AFAIK on Windows a PID doesn't help you much.
[2015-02-17 08:35:09] ato: Yeah, so on Windows you typically care about the thread group (I think it's called) and on Unix you care about the parent process that forked the subprocesses.
[2015-02-17 08:35:11] jimevans: ato: au contraire, my friend. a windows PID would help a great deal for some of the things i'd like to do.
[2015-02-17 08:35:26] simonstewart: jimevans: I'm back in London
[2015-02-17 08:35:30] antsanto_: hmmmm, but how come python was able to  be success?
[2015-02-17 08:35:48] ato: jentron_: You might be interested in https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/profiles/prefs_general.js
[2015-02-17 08:36:03] simonstewart: jimevans: isn't IE multiprocess? Or does it add everything to a process group?
[2015-02-17 08:36:27] ato: Process group was the name I was looking for.
[2015-02-17 08:36:57] jimevans: simonstewart: yes, IE is multiprocess, but generally, you can tie one process to one browser tab.
[2015-02-17 08:37:12] simonstewart: A frame or a tab?
[2015-02-17 08:37:17] simonstewart: (just curious
[2015-02-17 08:37:18] simonstewart: )
[2015-02-17 08:37:25] antsanto_: But I think, when we do new SafariDriver or any driver, some guy is opening the browser. We know the some guy, then why cant PID
[2015-02-17 08:37:26] jimevans: per tab, if memory serves.
[2015-02-17 08:38:10] jimevans: antsanto: because some browsers (i'm looking at you, IE) may not continue to use the process you launched.
[2015-02-17 08:38:37] antsanto_: BTW any idea, who gives the command to the OS to open specific browser? Which class that does this Selenium?
[2015-02-17 08:38:41] antsanto_: jimevans: Oh!
[2015-02-17 08:39:15] jimevans: consider what happens if you try to use the CreateProcess API on windows to launch the iexplore.exe found at C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer (x86) on a 64-bit windows system
[2015-02-17 08:39:36] jimevans: that'd be the fully 32-bit version of IE. or at least you'd think so.
[2015-02-17 08:40:16] antsanto_: I'm in this situation; we have bunch of cases, which are running in Safari. Sadly Safari doesnt gives you file upload :(. So we are using applescript to do the file upload. Things are working. But now we cant run them in parallel, as applescript doesnt know the PID, which asked for the file upload. !
[2015-02-17 08:40:47] jimevans: what'll happen is that the exectuable will be launched, then it will launch the 64-bit version in "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer", which is the 64-bit version, in another process (whose ID you *can't* know a priori), and silently exits the process *you* launched.
[2015-02-17 08:40:56] ato: antsanto_: In Java?
[2015-02-17 08:41:05] antsanto_: ato: Yeah!
[2015-02-17 08:41:18] jimevans: antsanto_: that's okay, the safari driver doesn't support multiple instances anyway. :)
[2015-02-17 08:41:19] ato: antsanto_: That's usually, but not guaranteed to be, org.openqa.selenium.os.CommandLine.
[2015-02-17 08:41:23] antsanto_: In java me calling applescript to do the file upload.
[2015-02-17 08:41:53] antsanto_: jimevans: Nope. We are running cases in Safari , in parallel. Why it cant support it?
[2015-02-17 08:42:37] antsanto_: Or I'm in the right direction?
[2015-02-17 08:42:51] antsanto_: sorry wrong direction*
[2015-02-17 08:43:00] simonstewart: Because safari doesn't support isolated instances>?
[2015-02-17 08:44:43] antsanto_: simonstewart: meaning?
[2015-02-17 08:45:01] simonstewart: WebDriver
[2015-02-17 08:45:10] simonstewart: WebDriver's protocol is single-threaded and blocking

[2015-02-17 13:59:21] CSWookie: Hey, all.  I know that in the python webdriver bindings, I can do "el1 == el2" to determine if two WebElements point to the same DOM element.  Can I do "el1.id is el2.id"?  Because I'd REALLY like to have a set of ids for elements and say "if el in el_set: return False".
[2015-02-17 13:59:52] CSWookie: Because the time it's taking to iterate through my list over and over is killing me.
[2015-02-17 13:59:56] AutomatedTester: CSWookie: no, because el1 and el2 don't share the same memory space
[2015-02-17 14:00:40] CSWookie: Is there another way for me to do this in a way that I can use a set to speed things up?

[2015-02-17 14:01:15] AutomatedTester: you can't do el1.id is el2.id because they arent in the same memory space
[2015-02-17 14:02:17] AutomatedTester: you might be able to do if el.id in [ele.id for ele in element_set]
[2015-02-17 14:02:24] AutomatedTester: but you still incur a loop
[2015-02-17 14:02:38] CSWookie: Yeah.  And the loop is killin' me.
[2015-02-17 14:03:02] AutomatedTester: that loop should be quick since it is all clientside
[2015-02-17 14:03:08] AutomatedTester: there is no RPC to the driver

[2015-02-17 14:05:37] CSWookie: Potentially big.
[2015-02-17 14:06:07] CSWookie: lukeis: Say on?
[2015-02-17 14:07:02] CSWookie: I'm looking for a quick way to say, "I want the nth element that matches any of the following xpaths and does not match any of these."
[2015-02-17 14:07:06] lukeis: el1 = driver.find_element_by_id("something");   el2 = driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#something")   <= "same" element and webdriver will potentially set a different element.id for each… thus the RPC
[2015-02-17 14:07:17] CSWookie: The first part is easy-peasy, but the second is slow.
[2015-02-17 14:07:47] CSWookie: Bummer.
[2015-02-17 14:07:56] lukeis: yeah, nope… can you contrive a new xpath?  you can do "not" in there
[2015-02-17 14:08:16] dude-x: CSWookie: for the record i never look at element.ID
[2015-02-17 14:08:26] lukeis: you shouldn't :)
[2015-02-17 14:08:27] CSWookie: I can, but I'm trying to avoid that, because the xpaths were getting gross. as it was.

[2015-02-17 14:08:32] lukeis: it's an internal webdriver ID
[2015-02-17 14:08:54] dude-x: it's useful to look at id's to determine if a single element has stopped mutating
[2015-02-17 14:08:55] dude-x: but that's it
[2015-02-17 14:08:59] CSWookie: I'm writing a DSL that lets folks write tests of workflows in English.
[2015-02-17 14:09:49] AutomatedTester: lukeis: el1 == el2 shouldnt do a rpc
[2015-02-17 14:10:34] lukeis: AutomatedTester: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/py/selenium/webdriver/remote/webelement.py#L386
[2015-02-17 14:11:21] AutomatedTester: hmmm

[2015-02-17 14:12:37] AutomatedTester: since it's just going to check the id's on the server
[2015-02-17 14:12:41] lukeis: the atoms can potentially return different WebDriver Id's for the same element...
[2015-02-17 14:12:55] dude-x: so that code was added sometime last year....
[2015-02-17 14:13:16] lukeis: i believe this a case in chrome, not sure it behaves like that in firefox
[2015-02-17 14:13:31] lukeis: and I don't think this is in the spec at all :-D
[2015-02-17 14:13:55] AutomatedTester: jesus jet-skiing christ!?!?!?!
[2015-02-17 14:14:03] CSWookie: I'm using old as dirt Firefox, and that's how it seems to be behaving.
[2015-02-17 14:18:10] CSWookie: Well, that sucks.

[2015-02-17 14:30:06] lukeis: of course "not in" doesn't work in javascript ;)

[2015-02-17 14:38:12] CSWookie: So, get all the potential matches, then get all the ones that are not matches, the pass both sets to a javascript function that compares them?
