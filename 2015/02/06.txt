[2015-02-06 11:20:46] ato: errant_rider: I suspect what you're looking for is equivalent to Array.slice(p.childNodes).filter(n => n.nodeType == 3).map(el => el.textContent).join("").

[2015-02-06 12:26:43] jleyba: not possible with WebDriver (not specific to WebDriverJS)
[2015-02-06 12:26:46] jleyba: You'll have to use a proxy
[2015-02-06 12:27:01] Lope: Hi jleyba. A proxy?
[2015-02-06 12:27:14] Lope: In what configuration?
[2015-02-06 12:27:42] Lope: Well at the moment I use greasemonkey to inject JS into the browser at page-start. it works nicely.
[2015-02-06 12:27:53] jleyba: Depends on what you're trying to do. But if you want to modify content before the page loads, you'll need to intercept HTTP responses and inject content there before it makes it to the browser
[2015-02-06 12:28:04] Lope: But I'm having trouble getting my greasemonkey configuration right with your webdriverJS.

[2015-02-06 12:28:40] Lope: I'm using 'firefox-profile' to make a firefox profile that includes firebug and greasemonkey. and I can configure all their prefs.js options as required.
[2015-02-06 12:28:52] Lope: but greasemonkey has it's own directory where it needs to find scripts.
[2015-02-06 12:29:04] Lope: I still need to figure out how to set that up.

[2015-02-06 12:34:42] Lope: I wasn't aware that selenium-webdriver has a firefox profile
[2015-02-06 12:34:47] Lope: is that a dir on the hard drive?
[2015-02-06 12:35:12] Lope: I've fixed the tabbing btw.
[2015-02-06 12:35:23] jleyba: included with `selenium-webdriver`
[2015-02-06 12:35:47] Lope: hmm, with your new webdriverJS doesn't it use FF directly?
[2015-02-06 12:36:23] jleyba: that was my next question.. why are you running through SeleniumServer? adds extra overhead to your test
[2015-02-06 12:36:44] Lope: I start with this: var webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver');

[2015-02-06 12:38:03] Lope: Basically I was creating a selenium-webdriver object and then creating a firefox profile with firefox-profile.
[2015-02-06 12:38:43] Lope: I noticed that when using your webdriverJS with chrome directly it was very stable. But when using webdriverJS via selenium-webdriver Firefox crashes every few minutes, unpredictably.
[2015-02-06 12:39:06] Lope: So I would very much like to avoid using selenium-webdriver (assuming it is causing the FF crashes)
[2015-02-06 12:41:00] Lope: oh, I've not been coding with webdriverJS for a while, I forgot that it's called selenium-webdriver.

[2015-02-06 12:46:51] Lope: I really got into the webdriverJS coding many weeks ago. I just came back to it now to pick up where I left off and I was a little unfamiliar with everything.

[2015-02-06 12:49:18] Lope: Just reading through your selenium-webdriver/firefox/profile.js. I'm wondering if I can use the same profile over and over. It might give me more speed.
[2015-02-06 12:49:36] Lope: (instead of creating a profile every time and writing it to a temp dir)
[2015-02-06 12:49:57] jleyba: The FirefoxDriver always creates a new profile
[2015-02-06 12:50:15] Lope: what is your profile.js intended to do?
[2015-02-06 12:50:23] jleyba: You can give it a pre-existing one to use as a template, but it will just copy it
[2015-02-06 12:51:08] andi5, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-06 12:51:19] Lope: I see that: var Profile = function(opt_dir) { ... this.template_ = opt_dir;
[2015-02-06 12:52:04] andi5: hi... is it a known issue that chrome collapses to the location bar and window borders after calling browser.manage().window().setSize(320, 780)?  (i am built a minimal case using http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/)

[2015-02-06 16:12:15] Lope_pi: all of that code isn't needed to see the bug/issue though.
[2015-02-06 16:13:06] Lope_pi: All you need to do is myProfile.addExtension(path.join(__dirname, 'ff-ext/greasemonkey-2.3-fx.xpi')); and you'll see Greasemonkey is not working.

[2015-02-06 16:13:43] jleyba: Where does the gm_scripts directy live?
[2015-02-06 16:13:48] Lope_pi: something is causing it to have it's main options greyed out/
[2015-02-06 16:13:55] Lope_pi: it lives in the ff profile dir
[2015-02-06 16:14:20] Lope_pi: If you've not used greasemonkey before you should try it, its amazingly useful.
[2015-02-06 16:14:36] SMaction, quitting. ()
[2015-02-06 16:14:46] jleyba: so you basically have an existing profile you want to use copy and then change varios preferences?
[2015-02-06 16:14:55] jleyba: (don't use firefox so no need for greasemonkey)
[2015-02-06 16:14:55] Lope_pi: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
[2015-02-06 16:15:09] Lope_pi: greasemonkey works in chrome also
[2015-02-06 16:15:29] Lope_pi: Not an existing profile, just an existing greasemonkey script.
[2015-02-06 16:16:37] jleyba: We can extend the API so you can copy additional files into the profile (like your script)
[2015-02-06 16:16:52] Lope_pi: if you add greasemonkey to your browser, make a script with alert('hello'); then set the include URL's on the script to * you'll see it functioning in your regular browser.
[2015-02-06 16:16:58] jleyba: but if the scripts show up as disabled, there might be a config incompatibility b/w webdriver and greasemonkey
[2015-02-06 16:17:17] Lope_pi: jleyba, the script is not disabled though.
[2015-02-06 16:17:27] Lope_pi: Greasemonkey itself is not fully working.

[2015-02-06 16:17:46] jleyba: anything interesting in firefox's error console?
[2015-02-06 16:17:48] Lope_pi: If you try create a new script in GM it won't let you type in the name.
[2015-02-06 16:18:28] Lope_pi: no
[2015-02-06 16:22:22] Lope_pi: Thanks jleyba (regarding extending the API) in the short term could you please give greasemonkey a try? How can we determine the problem?
[2015-02-06 16:24:16] Lope_pi: If this helps: it's behaving as though it doesn't have write access to the profile dir (my best wild guess)
[2015-02-06 16:27:28] jleyba: file a bug and I'll look into it
[2015-02-06 16:28:09] Lope_pi: thank you very much, where should I file it?
