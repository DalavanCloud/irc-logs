[2015-02-03 04:47:39] WhereIsMySpoon: so for java this would work: WebElement el = ((JavascriptExecutor)myDriver).executeScript("return document.getElementById('blah')");

[2015-02-03 08:19:36] jimevans: biscuits (as the term is used in the US) are a colloquialism for a type of shortbread. note that scones also fall into the same category. they (biscuits) are typically savory, as opposed to sweet, usually with buttermilk, which provides for a slightly acidic taste. they are easy, quick, and cheap to make, not requiring time to rise, which accounts for their prevalence in rural southern cooking.
[2015-02-03 08:19:52] dimacus: WhereIsMySpoon: to me, the deep south of USA is quite confusing stillâ€¦ although i do like the Georgia law that makes it a "grievous misdemeanor to serve Ice Tea without serving Sweet Ice Tea"
[2015-02-03 08:19:58] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: what does rising time have to do with southern coking?

[2015-02-03 08:22:26] joshin4colours: WhereIsMySpoon: "over easy" = fried

[2015-02-03 14:01:18] jimevans: i think there's still some work to be done to entirely turn off native events for firefox.
[2015-02-03 14:01:19] simonstewart: IWhat's the current stable firefox relase?
[2015-02-03 14:01:23] jimevans: 35.
[2015-02-03 14:01:37] jleyba: jimevans: work = deleting code?
[2015-02-03 14:01:46] lukeis: which is +2 the current release ;) (for native events)
[2015-02-03 14:03:03] barancev: lukeis: as soon as there is no issues in the tacker nobody cares about native events not working in FF34 + Se2.44
[2015-02-03 14:03:16] jimevans: jleyba: i'm pretty sure the advanced user interactions attempt to use native events if specified in the profile and do not fall back silently to synthetic events (at least if CI results are to be believed)
[2015-02-03 14:03:32] jleyba: was afraid of that

[2015-02-03 14:04:14] jleyba: jimevans: well, if that's the case, implementing the interactions api for Safari just became more likely to happen
[2015-02-03 14:04:35] jimevans: jleyba: the atoms are there. they just need to be wired up.
[2015-02-03 14:04:40] jleyba: I know
[2015-02-03 14:06:35] barancev: I don't think we need auto fallback in Actions API
[2015-02-03 14:06:49] jimevans: oh really?
[2015-02-03 14:07:16] barancev: people should set off native events explicitly or use an older FF
[2015-02-03 14:08:17] jimevans: okay, let's break every single user who tests firefox on windows and uses advanced user interactions. sorry but if we're going to pitch fits about not changing APIs at major version numbers, i'm going to pitch a fit about this.
[2015-02-03 14:08:32] jimevans: and no, i'm not volunteering to do the work.
[2015-02-03 14:08:51] jimevans: i've precious little time to tend to the maintenance i currently have for the next couple of days.
[2015-02-03 14:09:00] barancev: ah, this
[2015-02-03 14:09:10] barancev: yes, we can set default to off on windows too

[2015-02-03 14:09:31] barancev: I mean there should not be implicit fallback in the driver code
[2015-02-03 14:10:46] sevaseva: barancev: how about after ff34 is outside of the support window?
[2015-02-03 14:10:47] barancev: if a user set native events expicitly on it would be unfair to fallback
[2015-02-03 14:11:01] barancev: sevaseva: FF31 ESR is supported
[2015-02-03 14:11:28] jimevans: barancev: but we already do!
[2015-02-03 14:12:05] jleyba: sevaseva: FF34 is only a few weeks from falling out of support too: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Releases#Based_on_Gecko_36
[2015-02-03 14:12:28] barancev: jimevans: no, in Actions API -- no

[2015-02-03 14:12:45] sevaseva: barancev: ok. and after that is not supported and there are no native events anywhere in firefox, then okay to explicitly switch to synthetic, even for Actions API (when it is implemented) ?
[2015-02-03 14:13:09] jimevans: barancev: so suddenly, element.click() works, but Actions.click(element) doesn't. when the user doesn't change his or her code. what a lovely user story.
[2015-02-03 14:13:18] barancev: sevaseva: don't you trust in M-day? :)

[2015-02-03 14:14:03] simonstewart: What's changed in the C++ stuff that prevents us recompiling?
[2015-02-03 14:14:07] jleyba: jimevans: I see your point, but does this mean the project is completely blocked until someone implements synthetic events for interactions API in FF?
[2015-02-03 14:14:33] jleyba: simonstewart: Mozilla changed an API, no obvious fix
[2015-02-03 14:14:45] jimevans: simonstewart: mozilla removed a method from an interface that provided us an OS window handle. and no suitable replacement. the OS window handle is required for native events.
[2015-02-03 14:14:52] simonstewart: Oh.
[2015-02-03 14:15:09] simonstewart: Hmmm... presumably that window handle is still there _somewhere_, right?
[2015-02-03 14:15:34] jleyba: ato: is the interactions api implemented in marionette?
[2015-02-03 14:15:42] jimevans: the response from mozilla on the bug that was filed was, "yep. it got removed. don't rely on our binary apis"

[2015-02-03 14:16:25] barancev: jimevans: yes, element.click() works, but Actions.click() does not. that's exactly what's happening now when a user explicitly set native events on and upgrade Firefox to an unsupported version :)
[2015-02-03 14:16:35] simonstewart: I remember having to do a certain amount of hunting to find it in the first place
[2015-02-03 14:16:35] barancev: so we don't broke much
[2015-02-03 14:16:57] ato: jleyba: Only parts of it.
[2015-02-03 14:17:26] jimevans: okay, i'm stepping away for a bit. it's clear i'm not thinking rationally about this, and i'm likely to type something i'll later regret.

[2015-02-03 14:22:08] AutomatedTester: I suspect still in a good place because some people mentioned them on an internal list the other day

[2015-02-03 14:22:51] simonstewart: That might work for Windows users, who I guess are the guys who use native events the most
[2015-02-03 14:23:05] simonstewart: jleyba, sevaseva: how bad would losing native events on Linux be?
[2015-02-03 14:23:23] barancev: simonstewart: this is an idea of a new implementation: https://gist.github.com/barancev/ba21897fd373d8af5d04
[2015-02-03 14:23:43] barancev: but read jimevans comments on the compilation issues
[2015-02-03 14:24:07] barancev: in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1122727
[2015-02-03 14:24:32] simonstewart: Yeah. I saw that
[2015-02-03 14:24:33] sevaseva: simonstewart: only a small minority of tests/teams are broken. no big deal. internally we are rolling out ff35 wo native events already
[2015-02-03 14:25:02] simonstewart: Wondering whether we could do the native futzing with js-ctypes?
[2015-02-03 14:26:06] simonstewart: nsIBaseWindow.nativeHandle appears to still be present
[2015-02-03 14:27:25] simonstewart: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/widget/nsIBaseWindow.idl
[2015-02-03 14:29:03] simonstewart: Would something like this work? https://gist.github.com/shs96c/276e9705d565310343c1
[2015-02-03 14:29:33] simonstewart: Adapted from that page I linked to above
[2015-02-03 14:29:54] simonstewart: That way we can pass the HWND in
[2015-02-03 14:30:08] simonstewart: After obtaining it via ctypes
[2015-02-03 14:31:01] simonstewart: Anyone got a Windows machine that they can try that on, please?
[2015-02-03 14:33:06] barancev: yes, I can try
[2015-02-03 14:33:46] simonstewart: Sweet.

[2015-02-03 14:44:35] barancev: simonstewart: what is "Ci" in this code?
[2015-02-03 14:44:46] simonstewart: Components.interfaces, from memory

[2015-02-03 14:46:57] simonstewart: I think we can compile our native interaction code as a library and use js-ctypes to call into it directly
[2015-02-03 14:47:26] simonstewart: Meaning we'd never need to do a new selenium release in tandem with Firefox releases
[2015-02-03 14:47:44] simonstewart: We need our binary component to get the window handle
[2015-02-03 14:47:59] simonstewart: Everything else if using normal C library functions
