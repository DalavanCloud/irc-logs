[2015-02-09 12:30:19] RalphS: Hello. Relative newb to webdriver here. Does anyone know of any automated way of converting watir-classic tests/code into watir-webdriver / selenium webdriver code?
[2015-02-09 12:31:43] RalphS: We have a bunch of watir-classic tests / code, which we need to update, but I'm more familiar with straight webdriver, and would prefer if I could convert it first.
