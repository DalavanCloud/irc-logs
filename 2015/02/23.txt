[2015-02-23 02:34:56] Dave_B_: Abhay10908: People are likely to help if you have specific questions, but general questions not so much
[2015-02-23 02:37:15] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-23 02:38:48] Dave_B_: korg: I've no idea what changes between debug & playing a PS script :( nor have I ever used them with selenium - possibly others will have ideas but it's not a common use (didn't even know there was a PS extension for selenium) so you may find help isn't as easy to come by :(
[2015-02-23 02:39:33] WhereIsMySpoon: korg: did u try what the person responded with?
[2015-02-23 02:39:36] WhereIsMySpoon: to remove the unecessary code
[2015-02-23 02:39:39] WhereIsMySpoon: otherwise i have no idea
[2015-02-23 02:41:30] korg: I did try advice of person and not get good result
[2015-02-23 02:41:50] WhereIsMySpoon: k well i had no idea selenium even had a PS ext, and im 100% sure it isnt official in terms of support
[2015-02-23 02:41:51] korg: difficult question
[2015-02-23 02:42:10] WhereIsMySpoon: korg: try making a stackoverflow question
[2015-02-23 02:42:40] korg: stackoverflow question what it is mean?
[2015-02-23 02:42:54] WhereIsMySpoon: :google stackoverflow

[2015-02-23 03:01:03] chachan: gusy, I have a test for "Create an element", which tests a form and its submit. Now I want to test the delete, how can I avoid writing the creation again?. I mean, what's the best approach for these kind of tests?
[2015-02-23 03:01:10] chachan: guys*
[2015-02-23 03:02:06] cromero, quitting. (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[2015-02-23 03:03:32] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: how would you do this in a manual way?
[2015-02-23 03:03:35] WhereIsMySpoon: what steps would you take
[2015-02-23 03:05:10] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: since I don't want to assume I already have elements created. I'd would reach the page, fill the form, click "Save", and then click "Delete", and confirm
[2015-02-23 03:05:20] WhereIsMySpoon: so then, do the same
[2015-02-23 03:05:35] WhereIsMySpoon: think of selenium as purely automating your manual effort
[2015-02-23 03:05:44] WhereIsMySpoon: it's end-to-end testing, of what the user would do
[2015-02-23 03:06:09] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: the thing is that I already wrote the first steps for testing creation
[2015-02-23 03:06:20] WhereIsMySpoon: what you can do is abstract the "create", "fill", "save" bits of the process
[2015-02-23 03:06:22] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: is it possible to reuse that code?
[2015-02-23 03:06:25] WhereIsMySpoon: into separate functions
[2015-02-23 03:06:28] Dave_B_: it's possible to reduce code duplication by writing some kind of methods or classes to do the heavy lifting, but actually running it will probably need to be repeated
[2015-02-23 03:06:30] chachan: mm
[2015-02-23 03:06:43] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: one pattern that is used is the Page Object pattern
[2015-02-23 03:06:45] Dave_B_: e.g. PageObject models are often used, though thwere are other possible patterns
[2015-02-23 03:06:47] chachan: Dave_B_: yeah, I'm aware about it
[2015-02-23 03:06:49] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2015-02-23 03:06:59] *Dave_B_ typed too slow again! :p'
[2015-02-23 03:07:03] WhereIsMySpoon: hehe
[2015-02-23 03:07:24] chachan: will read about it, thank you guys :-)
[2015-02-23 03:07:27] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: I use it to great effect
[2015-02-23 03:08:29] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: though I advise against using WebElement fields if your website has any sort of timing issues...I've found that it's better to just have final By fields (in java terms) than to try and use the PageFactory with WebElement fields
[2015-02-23 03:08:45] WhereIsMySpoon: otherwise it sometimes fails to find them even though it's supposed to wait
[2015-02-23 03:10:17] WhereIsMySpoon: dunno if you've had the same Dave_B_
[2015-02-23 03:10:27] WhereIsMySpoon: then again, the site im working on is rather temperamental
[2015-02-23 03:10:30] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-02-23 03:10:35] chachan: interesting, I'm new on this and I was pointed to use WebElement from protractor (Angular.JS runner). I'm handling the timing issues adding a delay but still not sure if that's a good approach
[2015-02-23 03:10:46] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: you can use WebElement fine
[2015-02-23 03:10:58] WhereIsMySpoon: just not with the PageFactory if your website has a load of timing issues
[2015-02-23 03:11:17] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: you should handle timing issues using WebDriverWait or fluent waits
[2015-02-23 03:11:21] WhereIsMySpoon: not using sleeps
[2015-02-23 03:12:14] chachan: browser.driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(3000);
[2015-02-23 03:12:21] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: is that a sleep?
[2015-02-23 03:12:23] WhereIsMySpoon: nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[2015-02-23 03:12:27] chachan: lol
[2015-02-23 03:12:28] fabrice31, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-02-23 03:12:36] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: remove that code and never use implicitlyWait ever again
[2015-02-23 03:12:49] chachan: got it. Any reason?
[2015-02-23 03:12:54] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: what that does is set inside the bowls of webdriver some internal wait for every single findElement call
[2015-02-23 03:13:03] WhereIsMySpoon: what that "implicit wait" means is anyone's guess
[2015-02-23 03:13:08] WhereIsMySpoon: and can change at any time
[2015-02-23 03:13:25] SitamJana, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2015-02-23 03:13:37] Dave_B_: explicit waits are waiting for a certain condition to appear that you define (and are good). implicit waits tell the browser driver to do stuff on each call in a non-consistent way and makes timing issues way harder to debug
[2015-02-23 03:13:39] WhereIsMySpoon: and even if it doesn't, will mean that you aren't specifically controlling wait periods for findElement calls
[2015-02-23 03:13:48] WhereIsMySpoon: what dave said
[2015-02-23 03:13:52] SitamJana, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-23 03:14:42] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: what I've done is made a few wrapper functions like waitTenForElementVisibleThenClick(By by) which does a WebDriverWait for the element to be visible, then clicks it
[2015-02-23 03:15:15] WhereIsMySpoon: i have others such as waitForElementVisibleThenClick(By by, int secs), waitTenForElementVisibleThenSelect(By by, String valueToSelectBy) ...etc
[2015-02-23 03:15:24] WhereIsMySpoon: that way you dont have to write the wait each time :)
[2015-02-23 03:16:21] WhereIsMySpoon: id show you the code but its part of our company and so proprietary
[2015-02-23 03:16:38] WhereIsMySpoon: but im sure you get the idea :)
[2015-02-23 03:17:18] chachan: oh I see, but I'm not writing that each time. I use a kind of setUp method. But I see your point
[2015-02-23 03:17:38] chachan: the method/function is "onPrepare"
[2015-02-23 03:17:53] WhereIsMySpoon: a setup method before your test wont help you with timing issues for findElement calls
[2015-02-23 03:19:01] chachan: yes, I probably don't realize that because my tests are to small and simple so far
[2015-02-23 03:19:07] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2015-02-23 03:19:15] WhereIsMySpoon: but please remove that implicitlyWait
[2015-02-23 03:19:22] chachan: I'm reading about designs
[2015-02-23 03:19:35] chachan: yes, I will change it. Thanks for your advices
[2015-02-23 03:19:41] WhereIsMySpoon: no prob
[2015-02-23 03:19:53] WhereIsMySpoon: ask more qs if u got any :) someone here will generally answer
[2015-02-23 03:20:41] Dave_B_: you don't have to necessarily follow the design patter exactly by the way - e.g. my page objects don't return other page objects, I let the tests handle knowing what object comes next which saves coding logic into my page objects themselves (there are loads of places I can end up from the same button click, it was getting too messy :p)
[2015-02-23 03:21:28] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: I've actually got a little bit of page object inheritance
[2015-02-23 03:21:29] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-02-23 03:21:31] Dave_B_: (not suggesting that particular change will be appropriate for you, jsut giving an example)
[2015-02-23 03:22:19] Dave_B_: I've got some inheritance too, as there are a few 'types' of pages that all have similar stuff plus different extra bits
[2015-02-23 03:22:24] WhereIsMySpoon: yup
[2015-02-23 03:22:26] SitamJana, quitting. (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[2015-02-23 03:22:28] Dave_B_: not pure but meh. works for me :)
[2015-02-23 03:22:42] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2015-02-23 03:23:56] Dave_B_: just a warning chachan: You'll probably find that once you've built up a bunch of automation that it's keeping it all working that's the biggest bit of work, hence design patterns that minimise that work are important, even if for your first few tests they slow down creation.
[2015-02-23 03:24:17] Dave_B_: if your site doesn't change much then maybe less so, I've got about 40 devs making changes though!

[2015-02-23 03:25:46] WhereIsMySpoon: so i both know whats going on and can add little bits to help selenium out every now and then
[2015-02-23 03:27:59] chachan: guys, I'm reading about the pattern and it totally seems to be what I needed :-)
[2015-02-23 03:28:16] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2015-02-23 03:28:24] WhereIsMySpoon: its a good pattern
[2015-02-23 03:28:37] chachan: I see they use "waitForPageToLoad", not sure if that's available on JavaScript, I'll check it
[2015-02-23 03:28:38] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: just dont forget that you dont need to model -everything- on the web page
[2015-02-23 03:28:40] WhereIsMySpoon: only model what's needed
[2015-02-23 03:29:06] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: yes, in fact they're modeling the same case I need to
[2015-02-23 03:29:12] chachan: creating an element
[2015-02-23 03:29:18] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: and putting even small widgets and stuff inside separate PageObject classes/files/objects is useful
[2015-02-23 03:29:44] SitamJana, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2015-02-23 03:29:48] Dave_B_: yeah most of my page objects are at best partial - i add stuff to it only when i write a test that uses it

[2015-02-23 03:29:56] WhereIsMySpoon: creating automated tests is all about doing the overhead -now- and saving urself work in the long run
[2015-02-23 03:30:15] WhereIsMySpoon: plus creating more reliable and stable tests
[2015-02-23 03:31:11] chachan: yes, I'm also testing RESTful API with another framework, etc. Probably will add coverage in a near future
[2015-02-23 03:31:28] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2015-02-23 03:32:41] chachan: my next challenge will be see how to test UI using jenkins. Not sure how possible this could be
[2015-02-23 03:32:50] WhereIsMySpoon: very possible
[2015-02-23 03:32:59] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: look up selenium Grid
[2015-02-23 03:33:06] chachan: without UI?
[2015-02-23 03:33:16] WhereIsMySpoon: you dont need a screen to use selenium
[2015-02-23 03:33:33] WhereIsMySpoon: you will however need a virtual frame buffer
[2015-02-23 03:33:34] Dave_B_: can always xvfb it :p
[2015-02-23 03:33:36] Dave_B_: GAH
[2015-02-23 03:33:37] WhereIsMySpoon: xvfb for example
[2015-02-23 03:33:40] WhereIsMySpoon: hahahahaha
[2015-02-23 03:33:42] chachan: but you need to install server X or something like that right?
[2015-02-23 03:33:45] Dave_B_: why am i always jsut too slow?
[2015-02-23 03:33:54] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: xvfb :)
[2015-02-23 03:34:07] WhereIsMySpoon: dont try to use phantomjs/ghostdriver
[2015-02-23 03:34:08] WhereIsMySpoon: it sucks
[2015-02-23 03:34:19] *chachan is copying "xvfb" and pasting it on google'
[2015-02-23 03:34:25] WhereIsMySpoon: X Virtual Frame Buffer
[2015-02-23 03:34:54] WhereIsMySpoon: i imagine if you search "selenium grid xvfb setup" you'll get some good stuff

[2015-02-23 03:52:13] WhereIsMySpoon: java, python, js and .net are the most commonly used
[2015-02-23 03:52:21] WhereIsMySpoon: and are officially supported
[2015-02-23 03:52:23] WhereIsMySpoon: :apidocs
[2015-02-23 03:52:26] WhereIsMySpoon: ruby too
[2015-02-23 03:52:31] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2015-02-23 03:52:52] WhereIsMySpoon: php has about 5 or 6 bindings and is not officially supported, though is used
[2015-02-23 03:53:02] WhereIsMySpoon: (dont use php)
[2015-02-23 03:55:40] chachan: I'm using JavaScript now. But I don't find a "nice" way to replace the implicit wait
[2015-02-23 03:57:53] WhereIsMySpoon: chachan: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16882860/selenium-webdriver-js-explicit-wait
[2015-02-23 03:58:00] WhereIsMySpoon: the javascript impl uses promises
[2015-02-23 03:58:54] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: got it, makes sense :)
[2015-02-23 03:59:20] chachan: WhereIsMySpoon: I was checking it from protractor site. http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/api?view=webdriver.WebDriver.prototype.wait

[2015-02-23 09:49:05] shri: What is the best way to extend/override the driver.get call?
[2015-02-23 09:49:33] jimevans: shri: depends. what are you trying to accomplish that you feel like you need to override it?
[2015-02-23 09:50:08] shri: Well not really override it. But after the get call is completed, I want to read Javascript variables off the page returned.
[2015-02-23 09:50:24] shri: The variable might change based on the current page loaded in the driver.
[2015-02-23 09:50:52] jimevans: i'd wrap the call to driver.get, and use executeScript() to do it.
[2015-02-23 09:51:42] shri: basically inforce use of the wrapped call as opposed to driver.get?

[2015-02-23 09:53:15] shri: hmm that makes sense. but there is nothing preventing other devs from using driver.get
[2015-02-23 09:53:38] shri: its either that or I have to extend all driver types used in my test and override the methods?
[2015-02-23 09:54:09] jleyba: composition over inheritance. wrap it like jimevans suggested
[2015-02-23 09:54:39] shri: at a high level, after driver.get is complete the PageObject I have to use depends on the javascript variable
[2015-02-23 09:54:53] shri: so I have a proxy class that will delegate calls to either PageA or PageB depending on the value
[2015-02-23 09:55:27] jleyba: configure your page object to call executeScript as part of its loaded condition
[2015-02-23 09:56:06] jimevans: yep. fully implementing the Page Object pattern implies that your tests don't call any webdriver methods directly.
[2015-02-23 09:56:12] shri: yeah but page objects are wired through spring. so the objects have a reference to the driver but not its state

[2015-02-23 11:23:20] Ankit: I have googled, but haven't found an appropriate and working solution yet.
[2015-02-23 11:23:23] Ankit: Please help!
[2015-02-23 11:23:31] jleyba: why? windows only supports up to Safari 5.1.7, which is ancient

[2015-02-23 11:23:47] Ankit: Client requirements
[2015-02-23 11:24:10] jleyba: To test Safari 5.1.7?
[2015-02-23 11:24:19] jimevans: then, with all due respect, your clients don't know what the hell they're talking about.
[2015-02-23 11:24:29] Ankit: :P
[2015-02-23 11:24:32] Ankit: Can't help
[2015-02-23 11:24:55] jleyba: You really should explain that Safari on Windows is very very old and not representative of a modern browser
[2015-02-23 11:25:13] jleyba: You're better off using Chrome on Windows as an approximation
[2015-02-23 11:25:22] shri: lol
[2015-02-23 11:25:25] jimevans: if they can produce metrics that indicate they're getting meaningful traffic from safari 5.x, then, and only then, should you attempt to find a solution to automate it.
[2015-02-23 11:25:56] jimevans: but as dennis miller used to say, that's just my opinion, i could be wrong.
[2015-02-23 11:25:57] Ankit: They are asking me that if I can implement the flow with Win7+Safari
[2015-02-23 11:26:01] Ankit: I told yes we can....
[2015-02-23 11:26:11] Ankit: But the version is old
[2015-02-23 11:26:24] Ankit: So, they are saying that
[2015-02-23 11:26:33] jleyba: Ok....well, it's supported in Selenium
[2015-02-23 11:26:40] Ankit: Show a small flow on windows then we will think about MAC
[2015-02-23 11:27:02] jleyba: With java+selenium server, just use DesiredCapabilities.safari()
[2015-02-23 11:27:03] Ankit: So, I am stuck after launching the safari
[2015-02-23 11:27:05] jimevans: that's asinine.
[2015-02-23 11:27:12] jleyba: Oh...right
[2015-02-23 11:27:14] jimevans: (the clients, not you)
[2015-02-23 11:27:28] Ankit: It shows error that "error in connecting to safari extension"
