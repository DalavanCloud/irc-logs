[2015-02-18 00:17:49] bungiman: master on source?

[2015-02-18 03:12:56] Dave_B_: anyone know anything about this area / have any links to documentation or any useful extensions etc?
[2015-02-18 03:13:09] *Dave_B_ is wanting to make an auto-scaling grid and is jsut thinking how to get started'
[2015-02-18 03:15:39] Dave_B_: googling is giving me a million results of people asking the difference between max sessions and max instances etc, yawn :(
[2015-02-18 03:15:43] bimmelino: @Dave_B_: thats a good point. I had the same "problem" / wish. I ended up parsing the html dom from "/grid/console" with webdriver
[2015-02-18 03:17:41] bimmelino: so i could determine the number of busy (half-transparent browser logo) and avaiable (not transparent) browser instances
[2015-02-18 03:17:45] WhereIsMySpoon: ew
[2015-02-18 03:17:53] Dave_B_: Haha yeah I could do that, have the required skills inevitably! I'm hoping the info is available more easily than that, or if not I suppose I could try and find time to dig into how the hub works and try making a PR to add it
[2015-02-18 03:18:09] Dave_B_: not keen on scraping my own hub if I can avoid it :p
[2015-02-18 03:18:14] WhereIsMySpoon: but yea im not sure there's an api for the hub

[2015-02-18 07:48:57] trevorj: Hi everyone, I'm currently using docker-selenium to form a grid, and I'm trying to setup auto scaling according to load
[2015-02-18 07:53:01] trevorj: The question I have is related to docker networking I suppose with the hub and nodes
[2015-02-18 07:53:43] trevorj: I'd like to have one hub running on an ec2 instance, and a series of nodes running X number of node containers
[2015-02-18 07:54:11] trevorj: But the issue is the hub has to connect TO the nodes, not just the other way around, so I'm hitting a snag with an internet NAT
[2015-02-18 07:54:35] dimacus: yup
[2015-02-18 07:56:36] dimacus: trevorj: seems like you need to set up some sort of communication channel between the nodes and the hub
[2015-02-18 07:56:53] dimacus: i had a similar situation but between 2 data centers that could not freely communicate
[2015-02-18 07:57:16] dimacus: so set up 2 apache mod-proxies to allow the hub and nodes to talk over 1 channel back and forth
[2015-02-18 07:57:31] dimacus: and used the jvm's proxy settings to let the hub talk to nodes and nodes to hub
[2015-02-18 07:59:56] trevorj: s/internet/internal/ sorry
[2015-02-18 08:00:03] yenaemj, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-18 08:00:55] dimacus: trevorj: so can your nodes inside the containers see anything on the internal network?
[2015-02-18 08:01:03] dimacus: that part is configured correctly?
[2015-02-18 08:01:25] trevorj: dimacus: well with docker they have an internal emulated NAT between any nodes on that host
[2015-02-18 08:01:52] dimacus: yup
[2015-02-18 08:02:01] dimacus: but as you mentioned your HUB is on EC2, right?
[2015-02-18 08:02:12] trevorj: Yes, everything is on a VPC
[2015-02-18 08:02:33] dimacus: are the nodes running in docker on local network or in EC2 also?
[2015-02-18 08:02:58] trevorj: dimacus: and the IPs can overlap currently, unless I edit that and regenerate a proxy configuration upon (and dynamically assign the docker internal network)
[2015-02-18 08:03:03] trevorj: I could setup routing from the VPC I suppose
[2015-02-18 08:03:30] trevorj: But that just seems like a hack that shouldn't have to be done (dynamically assigning internal LAN network CIDRs according to host number)
[2015-02-18 08:05:04] trevorj: dimacus: all hosts are on the same network, each service runs in it's on container on an internal nat (per host), hub runs in a container on it's own host, multiple nodes run in containers on multiple hosts (this is the part I'm trying to scale to load)
[2015-02-18 08:05:24] bitgeeky, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-18 08:06:17] trevorj: My other idea to keep things easy was just to run a hub on each host as well, then setup a load balancer across the hubs
[2015-02-18 08:06:22] trevorj: But that's not optimal
[2015-02-18 08:07:21] dimacus: trevorj: that would be a little harder bc each hub tries to keep the state of the nodes
[2015-02-18 08:07:34] dimacus: so you would have to keep track of too many variables
[2015-02-18 08:08:03] emperorcezar, quitting. (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzzâ€¦)
[2015-02-18 08:08:08] dimacus: trevorj: is there any way for you to identify the nodes uniquely? on the network?
[2015-02-18 08:08:23] dimacus: docker-1-node1
[2015-02-18 08:08:24] dimacus: etc..
[2015-02-18 08:08:32] dimacus: so your hub can talk to nodes by name and not IP
[2015-02-18 08:09:17] trevorj: Talking by name ends up talking by IP after name resolution anyway
[2015-02-18 08:10:26] lampd1, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-18 08:10:45] dimacus: it's just that if docker allows you to have IP collisions between hosts, the hub will try to talk to multiple nodes via an IP but that IP is pointing to multiple nodes the hub will be confused
[2015-02-18 08:11:08] dimacus: if hub is outside of the docker, on say a regular host, it needs a unique communication channel to each of the nodes
[2015-02-18 08:12:14] trevorj: I'm thinking I might be able to change the node dockerfile to be able to specify the running port and assign that dynamically then expose it to the outside world, I'd also need a way to override what IP selenium sends to the hub when it registers
[2015-02-18 08:12:30] dimacus: that's easy
[2015-02-18 08:12:40] dimacus: one sec let me look up that flag
[2015-02-18 08:12:48] trevorj: Oh? Awesome.
[2015-02-18 08:12:57] trevorj: by outside world I mean my EC2 lan IP of the host ;)
[2015-02-18 08:13:37] fabrice31_, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-02-18 08:14:12] dimacus: the -host flag, that's how a node can identify itself to hub
[2015-02-18 08:14:48] dimacus: btwâ€¦ putting hub on ec2 is bad idea
[2015-02-18 08:15:43] trevorj: Why?
[2015-02-18 08:16:20] dimacus: bc if you put the hub on EC2, you now need to set up an ssh tunnel between the ec2 and your local network, think how sauce labs is using sauce connect
[2015-02-18 08:16:40] trevorj: Oh, the nodes that will be accessing selenium are on ec2 as well
[2015-02-18 08:16:54] dimacus: ahhhh
[2015-02-18 08:17:59] neeti, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-18 08:19:52] dimacus: trevorj: ok so as long as the nodes and hub are on same network and can talk to each other it's ok
[2015-02-18 08:20:18] dimacus: it's when you have ec2 hub trying to talk to nodes on your private network, that's hard
[2015-02-18 08:20:43] trevorj: Yeah
[2015-02-18 08:21:04] jleyba_, quitting. (Quit: jleyba_)
[2015-02-18 08:21:28] dimacus: in that case, set up the nodes to have a unique network address name/ip and have each node identify itself to the hub with the -host flag
[2015-02-18 08:21:48] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-18 08:22:04] trevorj: Does -host not make the server try to bind to that address?
[2015-02-18 08:22:16] trevorj: I need to send a different address than what it discovers
[2015-02-18 08:22:21] trevorj: And from what it binds to
[2015-02-18 08:23:07] dimacus: i'm not 100% sure but about 90% certain that the hub will use the -host coming from node to send the HTTP requests to what is specified
[2015-02-18 08:23:40] dimacus: so if the actual host is a.ec2.com and you identify it with -host node1, than the hub will send requests to http://node1:5555
[2015-02-18 08:25:10] trevorj: Great, I'll check that out
[2015-02-18 08:25:16] trevorj: dimacus: thanks for your help!
[2015-02-18 08:25:22] dimacus: yeah good luck
[2015-02-18 08:25:23] trevorj: I'm gonna take a look at this again later this week

[2015-02-18 08:45:06] jimevans: CSWookie: should be able to. that'd be a python-specific implementation detail, but for example, i know that you can pass an array to javascript in .NET.
[2015-02-18 08:45:56] jimevans: and yes, that array can contain WebElements, which will be properly deserialized across to the javascript running in the browser.
[2015-02-18 08:46:40] CSWookie: It seems like if I pass a list, arguments[0] accesses the first element in the list, rather than the list itself.
[2015-02-18 08:47:43] dimacus: jimevans: how goes it?

[2015-02-18 08:49:13] jimevans: nope.
[2015-02-18 08:49:19] dimacus: just delete and forget?
[2015-02-18 08:49:33] jimevans: we make no attempt at state management in the IE driver.
[2015-02-18 08:49:44] dimacus: best answer i could have ever wanted

[2015-02-18 08:50:06] jimevans: the only thing we do is if you pass the ie.ensureCleanSession capability, in which case, we'll delete history/cookies/cache.
[2015-02-18 08:50:24] dimacus: ohhhhh you don't even delete existing stufâ€¦ interesting

[2015-02-18 08:57:20] dimacus: except that safari does not give any hooks into a running processâ€¦ no wonder jleyba went crazyâ€¦ everything had to be done in JSâ€¦ everything!!

[2015-02-18 09:11:30] jimevans: 2 october.
[2015-02-18 09:12:56] AutomatedTester: jimevans: counting down the days?
[2015-02-18 09:13:52] jimevans: 226 and counting. :)
[2015-02-18 09:14:24] jimevans: might take a weekender between now and then, to take the Trouble Brothers along.
[2015-02-18 09:14:45] jimevans: but only because they have to stay with Dad while drharmony and i go. :)

[2015-02-18 09:27:47] barancev: FF36 in a week
[2015-02-18 09:29:04] barancev: there is a single "pro" vote to support native events given by simonstewart
[2015-02-18 09:29:23] barancev: chances that he implements them for FF35+?
[2015-02-18 09:29:24] jimevans: i've decided that if no one else can be persuaded to care about pushing a selenium update, i'm not going to either.
[2015-02-18 09:31:15] barancev: as I see it, the only thing that holds the release is native events support
[2015-02-18 09:31:44] barancev: as for the next version (FF36) we have another issue
[2015-02-18 09:31:46] lukeis: i'm a bit surprised at how little any backlash from users has been :)
[2015-02-18 09:31:49] jimevans: which i would like to see us continue to support, but i'm tired of fighting about it.

[2015-02-18 09:32:28] lukeis: only 16 stars? ;)
[2015-02-18 09:32:44] barancev: because FF36 is still in beta channel
[2015-02-18 09:32:58] barancev: you'll see the stars in a week
[2015-02-18 09:33:05] jimevans: well, that, and we haven't publicly released the fix for #8390
[2015-02-18 09:33:41] lukeis: ok, that's better 187 stars ;)
[2015-02-18 09:34:19] barancev: there is a comment (no.2) in #8399
[2015-02-18 09:34:35] lukeis: if someone wants to tag a revision and update the changelogs, i'd be more than happy to push the release artifacts

[2015-02-18 09:38:13] lukeis: i'd consider it another bug to fix the performance issue

[2015-02-18 09:40:48] CSWookie: WhereIsMySpoon: "return arguments[0].filter(function(el){return arguments[0].indexOf(1);});"
[2015-02-18 09:41:01] CSWookie: WhereIsMySpoon: arguments[0] is a list.
[2015-02-18 09:42:06] lukeis: CSWookie: indexOF(el)  instead???
[2015-02-18 09:42:32] CSWookie: lukeis: Same result, I just didn't copy that line, by accident.
[2015-02-18 09:42:53] lukeis: not sure what you're passing nor what you're expecting
[2015-02-18 09:43:12] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: you're aware that someList.indexOf(1) will expect the list to literally have the value of hte integer 1 in it?
[2015-02-18 09:43:30] WhereIsMySpoon: ["asd", "fg"].indexOf("asd") == 0
[2015-02-18 09:43:38] WhereIsMySpoon: ["asd", "fg"].indexOf(1) == -1
[2015-02-18 09:43:48] lukeis: what do you want returned?  the element if the element isn't in the list? or the element if it does exist in the list? or the index of the element in the list?
[2015-02-18 09:44:38] CSWookie: lukeis: I'm passing a list of WebElements.  In this case, I'm expecting to get the array back, since 1 isn't in the list, and -1 is true.
[2015-02-18 09:44:55] CSWookie: I'm not particularly worried about the result is, but I don't expect it to error out.
[2015-02-18 09:45:33] WhereIsMySpoon: so return arguments[0].indexOf(1); is just a long winded way of saying "return -1" since you -know- that 1 isnt in the list?
[2015-02-18 09:45:37] WhereIsMySpoon: im confused

[2015-02-18 09:47:51] lukeis: the arguments[0] is scoped to the functionâ€¦ it will be the same as "el" â€¦.

[2015-02-18 09:50:13] CSWookie: Here this is what I actually WANT to work.  Let's drop the stupid toy code.

[2015-02-18 09:52:57] barancev: cool!
[2015-02-18 09:53:08] dimacus: if you like that direction, i want to add a ton of other things to report on
[2015-02-18 09:53:29] dimacus: like total tests ran etcâ€¦ maybe ability to tweak a node on the fly
[2015-02-18 09:53:50] barancev: tweaking is optional
[2015-02-18 09:53:59] dimacus: yeah
[2015-02-18 09:54:15] dimacus: but i really want ability to mark node offline after current test is overâ€¦ similar to how jenkins does it
[2015-02-18 09:54:31] dimacus: this way i can reboot a windows node after current session is done, without it picking up a new test
[2015-02-18 09:54:39] dimacus: that would make me so happy
[2015-02-18 09:55:43] barancev: with JMX enabled we could reimplement web console too
[2015-02-18 09:55:48] WhereIsMySpoon: CSWookie: and you've checked this works fine in a normal browser?
[2015-02-18 09:55:48] dimacus: yup
[2015-02-18 09:55:54] WhereIsMySpoon: in the console
[2015-02-18 09:56:11] dimacus: barancev: yeh that's the ideaâ€¦ make it less expensive to load that HTML
[2015-02-18 09:56:43] barancev: at the moment the console provides only information gathered from the hub
[2015-02-18 09:56:53] dimacus: yup
[2015-02-18 09:56:55] barancev: no actual info about node
[2015-02-18 09:57:01] barancev: *nodes
[2015-02-18 09:57:12] dimacus: yeah that would be completely awesome to add
[2015-02-18 09:59:38] CSWookie: Yes, I'll double verify, though.

[2015-02-18 13:18:15] joshin4colours: so, something I've been wondering
[2015-02-18 13:18:53] joshin4colours: is the plan for Marionette/FF to have Marionette be a separate "driver" similar to the IEDriver and Chromedriver?
[2015-02-18 13:21:40] lukeis: essentially it already isâ€¦ but even better, it's bundled in firefox itself ;) (except it doesn't speak the exact same protocol, so there is a 'shim' the translates the JSON RPC to what marionette uses)
[2015-02-18 13:22:00] lukeis: ato: correct me please :) ^   i often forget the exact state of the world
[2015-02-18 13:22:15] AutomatedTester: joshin4colours: jgraham has written a rust based implementation of the executable
[2015-02-18 13:22:59] joshin4colours: lukeis: ah, ok
[2015-02-18 13:23:19] joshin4colours: so, Marionette will continue to be explicitly a part of gecko/FF?
[2015-02-18 13:23:41] dude-x: currently it's a bit more hidden...
[2015-02-18 13:23:45] dude-x: but it's builtin
[2015-02-18 13:23:51] AutomatedTester: joshin4colours: there is 2 parts to marionette
[2015-02-18 13:24:12] AutomatedTester: there is the Mozilla implementation, that won't really use the executable since it is superfulous
[2015-02-18 13:24:44] AutomatedTester: and then there is what the webdriver community will use
[2015-02-18 13:25:00] AutomatedTester: which is the "FirefoxDriver" executable that speaks to marionette
[2015-02-18 13:25:35] lukeis: where is the rust thing?
[2015-02-18 13:25:44] AutomatedTester: that is the "FirefoxDriver"
[2015-02-18 13:25:51] ato: https://github.com/jgraham/wires
[2015-02-18 13:25:52] AutomatedTester: that is the httpd executable
[2015-02-18 13:26:00] lukeis: fyi 'marionette':  https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/marionette
[2015-02-18 13:26:24] lukeis: ato: horrible repo name ;)
[2015-02-18 13:26:51] AutomatedTester: but since everyone thinks downloading a gazillion things just to use webdriver is a great idea we have to have it
[2015-02-18 13:26:52] ato: Reality is that different language bindings (at least Python, Java, and .NET) will provide a client implementation of the Marionette protocol though, so for them a shim probably won't be needed.
[2015-02-18 13:27:18] jimevans: AutomatedTester: leave it, man.

[2015-02-18 14:34:00] soLucien: Hi guys ! How do you handle authentication in Selenium?
[2015-02-18 14:34:16] soLucien: using C#
[2015-02-18 14:34:33] soLucien: There are like 24113412 different answers, some are outdated and others don't work
[2015-02-18 14:35:54] smccarthy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2015-02-18 14:37:28] soLucien: So .. how do you handle the Authentication Required Alert/Dialog
[2015-02-18 14:37:29] soLucien: ?
[2015-02-18 14:37:59] dude-x: you can not;
[2015-02-18 14:38:42] dude-x: well if the browser supports this type of authentication you can do a get with (user:password@http://site)
[2015-02-18 14:38:56] Jaykul, changing nick to Windows.
[2015-02-18 14:39:07] dude-x: otherwise use an http client and auth that way, and then grab the cookie and put in the browser using selenium
[2015-02-18 14:39:10] Windows, changing nick to Jaykul.
[2015-02-18 14:39:38] soLucien: ok the @ doesn't work
[2015-02-18 14:40:31] CSWookie, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2015-02-18 14:42:19] soLucien: So dude-x: the authentication does not seem to be cookie-based, but session-based
[2015-02-18 14:43:59] dude-x: do you know the how the session is handled? if an http client connects, can you have selenium take over
[2015-02-18 14:45:12] soLucien: i logged in through Chrome, then inspected the cookies. There were 0 cookies stored for the websire
[2015-02-18 14:45:19] soLucien: website*
[2015-02-18 14:46:38] soLucien: it's running on IIS, and using some kind of windows authentication. I actually don't know what it is, but I'm supposed to write tests for it
[2015-02-18 14:46:50] soLucien: and typing in username/password every run is annoyoing
[2015-02-18 14:47:04] soLucien: kind of defeats the purpose of automated testing
[2015-02-18 14:47:27] CSWookie, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-18 14:47:54] dude-x: unfortunately, selenium doesn't seem to support basic auth; but i am not 100% sure if some language implementations do provide a way
[2015-02-18 14:48:05] dude-x: java doesn't, can't speak for c#
[2015-02-18 14:48:25] soLucien: dude-x : is there any way to type in stuff using selenium?
[2015-02-18 14:48:34] soLucien: simulate typing username
[2015-02-18 14:48:37] dude-x: not in the pop up dialog box
[2015-02-18 14:48:37] soLucien: then tab key
[2015-02-18 14:48:40] dude-x: using selenium
[2015-02-18 14:48:43] soLucien: then password
[2015-02-18 14:48:48] soLucien: then tab again and enter
[2015-02-18 14:48:51] dude-x: you can use AutoIT on windows
[2015-02-18 14:49:13] soLucien: damnit
[2015-02-18 14:50:46] dude-x: you can use an HTTP client to do auth though
[2015-02-18 14:50:58] dude-x: and then pass on the info to selenium
[2015-02-18 14:51:23] dude-x: whether's it a cookie or a URL that has a sesion id
[2015-02-18 14:55:46] soLucien: what do you mean?
[2015-02-18 14:56:01] soLucien: Selenium starts up Firefox
[2015-02-18 14:56:04] soLucien: runs the tests
[2015-02-18 14:56:07] soLucien: then closes
[2015-02-18 14:56:14] soLucien: that's how it runs without auth
[2015-02-18 14:57:02] soLucien: with auth i have to type stuff in every time, no matter what i try
[2015-02-18 14:57:23] soLucien: so how could i do auth first and pass info to selenium?

[2015-02-18 14:59:00] soLucien: this is where I am now
[2015-02-18 15:00:54] jimevans: soLucien: the answer depends on what type of authentication it is. in any case, webdriver doesn't know how to handle the authentication dialogs displayed by the system. there may be workarounds if the authentication is entirely browser-based (like "basic authentication").
[2015-02-18 15:01:22] jimevans: but even in that case, it won't be as easy as the webdriver api makes other things.

[2015-02-18 15:03:15] jimevans: well, again, without knowing what type of authentication, you're going to be flying a little blind.
[2015-02-18 15:03:45] soLucien: ok , should i look up on the server side to see what kind of auth it uses?
[2015-02-18 15:03:53] soLucien: I'm guessing it's user access control
[2015-02-18 15:04:03] soLucien: the standard windows thing
[2015-02-18 15:04:30] jimevans: soLucien: then it's probably what's called NTLM authentication, in which case it's not a browser dialog, but a system dialog that pops up.
[2015-02-18 15:04:44] jimevans: and the only way to automate that will be to use an external library.
[2015-02-18 15:04:59] jimevans: people will say to use autoit. i will never, ever, ever make that recommendation.
[2015-02-18 15:05:22] jimevans: (though i won't judge those who do)
[2015-02-18 15:08:32] soLucien: jimevans how could i find out what kind of authentication the server is using?
[2015-02-18 15:08:38] soLucien: Telnet? :)
