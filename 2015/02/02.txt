[2015-02-02 01:45:40] SamuraiJack: I'd like to complain loudly about this issue: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=6390
[2015-02-02 01:46:19] SamuraiJack: it has a clearly reproducible test case and its a hard failure of the webdriver just doing very basic API call
[2015-02-02 01:47:01] SamuraiJack: now that this issue also appeared in ChromeDriver (in Firefox driver it presents for a long time already) it affects our product too much
[2015-02-02 01:47:30] SamuraiJack: I'm not sure if its a but of selenium itself or of those respectful drivers
[2015-02-02 01:47:45] SamuraiJack: but definitely would be great to see it fixed

[2015-02-02 07:53:48] patchie: hi, can i use selenium ide to make benchmarks of a intranet website? like load 10 intranet pages each hour and log loadingtime over a few weeks to see trends?
[2015-02-02 07:57:11] dimacus: patchie: in general not a good idea
[2015-02-02 07:57:22] patchie: why?
[2015-02-02 07:57:24] dimacus: selenium is the worst tool you can use for performance testing
[2015-02-02 07:57:28] dimacus: too many variable
[2015-02-02 07:57:49] dimacus: there are plenty of other tools that will test a website load speed etc
[2015-02-02 07:57:53] dimacus: try jmeter
[2015-02-02 07:57:56] dimacus: or loadrunner
[2015-02-02 07:58:39] patchie: can these tools log into a webpage and go to a specific site?...and then make a graph over time so i can analyze?
[2015-02-02 07:58:57] dimacus: yeah that's what they do, especially the laod runner
[2015-02-02 07:58:57] dude-x, quitting. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2015-02-02 07:59:01] dimacus: they are a little pricey
[2015-02-02 07:59:27] dimacus: jmeter is free but it's a pain to learn and get going
[2015-02-02 08:00:27] patchie: ahh
[2015-02-02 08:00:37] patchie: does it do intranet sites?
[2015-02-02 08:01:18] dimacus: it runs on your computer and you record the actions you want it to perform, it does those without browser, as HTTP requests in the background
[2015-02-02 08:01:31] dimacus: this is nice bc you can simulate 1,000 people using the site at once
[2015-02-02 08:01:45] patchie: aha, nice
[2015-02-02 08:01:59] patchie: what programming language do i need to know?
[2015-02-02 08:02:20] dimacus: honestly don't remeber but things like load runner uses excel
[2015-02-02 08:02:25] dimacus: it's made for non programmers
[2015-02-02 08:02:48] patchie: ahh, cool
[2015-02-02 08:03:00] patchie: thanks a lot..i will check out some youtube videos
[2015-02-02 08:03:06] dimacus: yeah those are nice tools, there are plenty of other tools
[2015-02-02 08:03:16] dimacus: i haven't done load testing in years so dunno
[2015-02-02 08:04:08] patchie: aha, ok

[2015-02-02 09:00:31] CSWookie: ?
[2015-02-02 09:01:20] jimevans: CSWookie: you'd probably need to use the "actions" api. but that's going to be doomed to failure.
[2015-02-02 09:01:33] dude-x: CSWookie: you can't in that aspect
[2015-02-02 09:02:00] dude-x: the actions API has a "context click" which is the right click
[2015-02-02 09:02:13] dimacus: CSWookie: on top of that, even if you right click and do a save as, how will you deal with the "Save file" dialog?
[2015-02-02 09:02:14] dude-x: but it's only useful for webpages that can respond to a right click
[2015-02-02 09:02:24] jleyba: not possible. "Save as..." is from a system dialog which WebDriver doesn't interact with
[2015-02-02 09:02:26] dude-x: with a custom menu
[2015-02-02 09:02:48] jimevans: CSWookie: what jleyba said. that's what i meant by "doomed to failure."
[2015-02-02 09:03:03] CSWookie: I don't actually care if it really DOES do the right-click ets, I really just want to download the link.  The download dialog isn't a problem, because I've got the preferences in the profile to always save to a particular directory, and not raise the dialog.
[2015-02-02 09:03:25] jleyba: CSWookie: getPageSource(), write the response to a file
[2015-02-02 09:03:40] jleyba: or just use a vanilla HTTP client and download the file without webdriver
[2015-02-02 09:03:41] ato: You can't automate the context menu with WebDriver; it's focussed on the content browser, not the chrome.
[2015-02-02 09:03:55] jleyba: (can use WebDriver to get the cookies for authentication)
[2015-02-02 09:04:00] ato: I'd probably use el.getElementAttribute("href") and give the URL to a HTTP client.

[2015-02-02 09:25:01] AutomatedTester: jleyba: since executeScript stuff should all be able to be marshalled to JSON I think the browser should let us know when bad things are happening

[2015-02-02 09:56:15] ato: AutomatedTester: Obviously the notion of “undefined” isn't compatible with JSON, so we'd need some special concept for referring to a value that is undefined (like we refer to web elements) if we should decide to allow that.
[2015-02-02 09:57:30] AutomatedTester: ato: the more that I think about it, the more I think I just want to leave it to http://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#returning-http-response
[2015-02-02 09:58:23] AutomatedTester: ato: since that says stringify. I am not sure what would cause json.stringify to error
[2015-02-02 09:59:04] p0deje, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-02 09:59:07] ato: AutomatedTester: Yes, so the return value from JSON.stringify(undefined) is undefined, which is assigned to the value property on the response JSON object, which when stringified disappears.
[2015-02-02 09:59:31] davehunt, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)

[2015-02-02 10:00:33] AutomatedTester: hmm
[2015-02-02 10:01:40] ato: If you have a response, {value: undefined}, which is possible if your WebDriver server is written in JS (Safari, Marionette, FirefoxDriver), serialising that will become {} indeed.
[2015-02-02 10:02:17] lukeis: do we need to solve this in the Spec itself? or in some wpt?
[2015-02-02 10:02:29] AutomatedTester: in the spec
[2015-02-02 10:02:50] ato: We either need to specify that undefined variables are allowed in the value of a response, or say that all undefined's will be coerced to null so that we can be consistent across implementations.

[2015-02-02 10:03:50] ato: I think it's easier to say that if the return value of JSON.stringify is undefined, return null.
[2015-02-02 10:04:05] lukeis: +1
[2015-02-02 10:05:04] ato: That's implicitly saying: We don't care about languages which has a way to assign undefined to variables, like JavaScript, Perl, and Haskell.

[2015-02-02 10:13:47] ato: AutomatedTester: FWIW the only language I can think of where rv in rv = executeScript("return undefined") is assigned to the JS notion of undefined is Node.js.  It makes absolutely no sense in other languages like Perl because without "use warnings;" it cause you having a bad day.
[2015-02-02 10:14:11] ato: AutomatedTester: Even in C if we decided to do this in a strict way, it would cause a segmentation fault.

[2015-02-02 10:14:51] ato: AutomatedTester: So really the one language that it would help to have a special notion about undefined's is JS.
[2015-02-02 10:14:59] jleyba: AutomatedTester: not sure I understand what you're asking. `var foo = function (){return 1;}; JSON.stringify(foo); ` doesn't have a return statement, so I'd expect the browser to just return

[2015-02-02 10:21:33] jleyba: AutomatedTester: well we need to recurse on properties to find all DOM elements

[2015-02-02 11:33:26] dimacus: jleyba: throwing away that PR and getting a butchers knife to delete things!
[2015-02-02 11:36:20] jleyba: dimacus: cool. I'm going to leave a follow-up message on that for why you closed it
[2015-02-02 11:37:33] jleyba: dimacus: we probably should update the extension in some way so it's painfully obvious in the UI when the extension is enabled
[2015-02-02 11:37:54] jleyba: the logs checkbox added to the toolbar might be too subtle
[2015-02-02 11:39:00] dimacus: well in that PR i did have better error messages
[2015-02-02 11:39:10] dimacus: in case the extension is not installed or disabled etc
[2015-02-02 11:39:33] dimacus: so i'll re-use some of it, and it would give user an error in a stack trace in clear language "no extension installed"
[2015-02-02 11:40:01] jleyba: I'm talking about for when users browse with Safari when they're not running WebDriver

[2015-02-02 11:41:18] dimacus: green for enabled red for disabled?
[2015-02-02 11:41:25] dimacus: or apple style guide does not allow that?
[2015-02-02 11:41:52] jleyba: not allowed.. would interfere with their pretty UI
[2015-02-02 11:41:59] dimacus: heh
[2015-02-02 11:42:08] dimacus: first time ever someone said safari UI is pretty
[2015-02-02 11:42:27] jleyba: I'm sure Apple thinks it is

[2015-02-02 11:45:44] dude-x: so it should be possible to add a little Se button or something
[2015-02-02 11:45:51] dimacus: well the button is already there
[2015-02-02 11:46:06] dimacus: not sure if you can make it colorful though
[2015-02-02 11:46:10] jleyba: dimacus: <h1 style="background:red">Warning: you appear to be using the WebDriver extension without an active client.</h1>
