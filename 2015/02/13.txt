[2015-02-13 13:11:19] dude-x: the most popular use of 'is' in Python is to check for None specifically since it's a singleton object
[2015-02-13 13:13:14] CSWookie: dude-x: I know that's what it's for, but you can override it (I think the function is __hash__).  I didn't know which of the methods was overridden.

[2015-02-13 13:15:06] AutomatedTester: CSWookie: webelement has a __eq__ function so you can do element == another_element
