[2015-02-24 02:27:42] bourgismael: Hi, do someone have a good tuto to integrate Selenium Tests with Jenkins ? I found some but I always have some trouble or they are outdated.
[2015-02-24 02:32:59] WhereIsMySpoon: bourgismael: use the jenkins plugin for selenium which will start a hub on the jenkins server, register nodes with that hub, et walla
[2015-02-24 02:33:19] WhereIsMySpoon: you will be able to see connected nodes with the plugin
[2015-02-24 02:34:01] bourgismael: I use this but my tests always blocked at step : 'Checking Resource aliases'
[2015-02-24 02:34:17] WhereIsMySpoon: and what log does that come from
[2015-02-24 02:34:22] WhereIsMySpoon: or what output
[2015-02-24 02:34:30] WhereIsMySpoon: the hub? node? your test?
[2015-02-24 02:34:57] WhereIsMySpoon: can you paste the whole output in a :gist ?

[2015-02-24 02:48:51] WhereIsMySpoon: sim2: and is this new url valid?..

[2015-02-24 02:57:59] WhereIsMySpoon: though im not using phantomjs
[2015-02-24 02:58:04] WhereIsMySpoon: (which I personally recommend to avoid)
[2015-02-24 02:58:46] sim2: oh why to avoid phantomJS, from what I read it seemed a really good solution?
[2015-02-24 02:58:53] sim2: what would you recommend instead?
[2015-02-24 02:59:05] WhereIsMySpoon: because it doesnt behave the same way as a browser would
[2015-02-24 02:59:18] sim2: I changed the expected title text and it hasn't made a difference
[2015-02-24 02:59:21] WhereIsMySpoon: I assume you wanted to use phantomjs because its headless?
[2015-02-24 03:00:02] sim2: yes
[2015-02-24 03:00:21] WhereIsMySpoon: sim2: you can do the same by just using XVFB and running chrome/ff inside that

[2015-02-24 03:04:21] Dave_B_: ahh, xvfb seems to be topic of the month in here :)
[2015-02-24 03:04:39] sim2: ok thanks, so it seems the commands can be integrated into the script the same way that I am calling phantomJS currently?
[2015-02-24 03:05:14] sim2: although that link confuses me as I've never seen ruby before haha
[2015-02-24 03:05:23] WhereIsMySpoon: ignore the ruby parts
[2015-02-24 03:05:29] WhereIsMySpoon: just focus on the linux console parts
[2015-02-24 03:05:37] WhereIsMySpoon: about display and stuff
[2015-02-24 03:05:56] sim2: yeah I was trying to extract that info and workout how I'd put that into javascript
[2015-02-24 03:06:23] Dave_B_: so my tests don't know they're being run in xvfb, it's just how i kick them off
[2015-02-24 03:06:32] Dave_B_: e.g. if I previously ran 'runtests'
[2015-02-24 03:06:46] Dave_B_: now I run xvfb-run --server-args="-screen 1 1920x1080x8" runtests
[2015-02-24 03:06:49] *WhereIsMySpoon lets Dave_B_ explain'
[2015-02-24 03:06:56] *WhereIsMySpoon doesnt use xvfb'
[2015-02-24 03:08:25] Dave_B_: the commands in your test don't care what browser type you've got so they should be fine (though of course you have to create the right driver instance in the first place)
[2015-02-24 03:08:55] Dave_B_: the test has no idea you're running headless, the browser also doesn't know, only you know
[2015-02-24 03:09:00] sim2: yeah so where the webdriver bit is I'd change the browserName there
[2015-02-24 03:09:20] Dave_B_: yep you'd change that, to be firefox or chrome or whatever you like
[2015-02-24 03:09:29] Dave_B_: how do you currently trigger your tests?
[2015-02-24 03:10:02] sim2: I run 'mocha' and it executes them
[2015-02-24 03:10:09] Dave_B_: OK, so…
[2015-02-24 03:10:17] Dave_B_: xvfb-run --server-args="-screen 1 1920x1080x8" mocha
[2015-02-24 03:10:26] Dave_B_: should be enough :)
[2015-02-24 03:10:41] Dave_B_: probably can get away without the server args tbh
[2015-02-24 03:11:10] Dave_B_: ehh, you'll need to make sure you've got xvfb installed first
[2015-02-24 03:11:14] sim2: Yeah thanks that's really useful. Will try set that up in a minute, I now have to answer lots of questions a client has been asking our sales director who obviously knows nothing
[2015-02-24 03:11:25] Dave_B_: cool, good luck :)
[2015-02-24 03:12:09] sim2: cheers, think I'm gonna be around here more though haha if I can get things going well then I will scooch into being a dedicated automated tester at my company ;)
[2015-02-24 03:12:25] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2015-02-24 03:13:15] Dave_B_: if you're around often at this kinda time you'll find me and WhereIsMySpoon around a lot :)

[2015-02-24 04:57:59] sim2: I managed to install xfvb and execute the test that way, an actual firefox browser window does pop up though when running the test. Is there a switch to stop that?
[2015-02-24 04:57:59] sim2: Also my initial issue of getTitle returning a null value is still occurring.
[2015-02-24 04:59:45] Dave_B_: hmm that's odd, all children processes should be outputting to the virtual frame buffer I think
[2015-02-24 04:59:58] operatiay, quitting. (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[2015-02-24 05:01:03] sim2: yeah the test executes, a browser window pops up and then terminates itself
[2015-02-24 05:02:06] Dave_B_: how exactly are you triggering your test run now?
[2015-02-24 05:03:22] sim2: xvfb-run --server-args="-screen 1 1920x1080x8" mocha
[2015-02-24 05:03:28] Dave_B_: ok cool
[2015-02-24 05:03:33] sim2: and same if I don't run the server args
[2015-02-24 05:04:35] Dave_B_: hmm, seems like that *should* work to me, I'll jsut do some quick googling and see if I can see anything
[2015-02-24 05:05:01] Dave_B_: oh, maybe shouldn't use screen 1… what happens if you try:
[2015-02-24 05:05:05] Dave_B_: xvfb-run --server-args="-screen 99 1920x1080x8" mocha
[2015-02-24 05:05:31] sim2: ok will try
[2015-02-24 05:06:01] sim2: xvfb failed to start with the screen 99 command
[2015-02-24 05:06:07] Dave_B_: awesome :p
[2015-02-24 05:06:20] Dave_B_: ok so we'll try to create a display and export it then run our tests...
[2015-02-24 05:07:29] sim2: was that option 1 from that link, where you start sfvb as a background process?
[2015-02-24 05:07:39] Dave_B_: yep
[2015-02-24 05:07:40] Dave_B_: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb
[2015-02-24 05:07:50] sim2: ok cool, will try that
[2015-02-24 05:08:36] Dave_B_: Xvfb :99 &
[2015-02-24 05:08:36] Dave_B_: mocha
[2015-02-24 05:08:36] Dave_B_: export DISPLAY=:99
[2015-02-24 05:08:38] Dave_B_: or something
[2015-02-24 05:09:56] Dave_B_: (I'm suspecting that the display we used, display 1, is already in use as your actual real display - but that's conjecture, I'm far from an expert in xvfb)
[2015-02-24 05:11:00] Dave_B_: oh, we never set a display, only a screen, bleh
[2015-02-24 05:11:20] sim2: ok trying to set it as a background process now, in between eating my pasta lol
[2015-02-24 05:13:47] Dave_B_: hmm not sure if screennum has a maximum value
[2015-02-24 05:14:45] sim2: so I ran Xvfb :99 & export DISPLAY=:99
[2015-02-24 05:14:45] sim2: and I get the same behaviour, firefox window pops up and terminates itself
[2015-02-24 05:15:35] sim2: although at this point that's the minor issue
[2015-02-24 05:15:59] sim2: trying to work out why getTitle returns a null value is screwing with me more so lol
[2015-02-24 05:16:15] Dave_B_: yeah :(
[2015-02-24 05:16:51] Dave_B_: I'm confused as to why the ff window would appear but also why your test would say it's a null value
[2015-02-24 05:17:09] Dave_B_: it's a bit like it's making a second driver instance that hasn't navigated to the right place
[2015-02-24 05:17:17] sim2: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4e6bb2419e7d1a55838d
[2015-02-24 05:17:17] *Dave_B_ goes back to look at your code'
[2015-02-24 05:17:23] sim2: slight edit
[2015-02-24 05:17:50] sim2: I'm gonna kill the selenium webserver instance and restart, wonder if that would make any difference
[2015-02-24 05:19:18] sim2: same error
[2015-02-24 05:19:18] sim2: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e88db479f51a9f1a1f83
[2015-02-24 05:22:11] Dave_B_: if we just don't use xvfb at all (it's adding complexity to the problem at the moment!) but stick with firefox so we should see us navigating to the given url...
[2015-02-24 05:22:28] Dave_B_: I'm assuming the navigation never happens?
[2015-02-24 05:22:38] sim2: the output from the webserver terminal window all seems correct
[2015-02-24 05:23:19] sim2: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/92e361c917cd57806991
[2015-02-24 05:23:40] Dave_B_: yeah looks right...
[2015-02-24 05:24:41] sim2: yeah, the code all seems corrent and the outputs all seem right, not sure what's going wrong
[2015-02-24 05:33:08] Dave_B_: I'm not very familiar with the specifics of the JS stuff as I don't use it
[2015-02-24 05:33:30] sim2: fair enough, what do you generally use?
[2015-02-24 05:33:35] Dave_B_: do you know what version of the driver you're using, as well as the version of firefox?
[2015-02-24 05:33:38] Dave_B_: i use python
[2015-02-24 05:33:48] Dave_B_: so e.g. https://gist.github.com/daveberg/2a07ac1717db2f404e4c gives me the expected title
[2015-02-24 05:34:46] sim2: ah see I've used python much more recently than javascript (which I've not used for years) but when I was googling around js seemed to be in the results so I figured I would just use it, but I know python better.
[2015-02-24 05:34:46] sim2: so how is your setup structured?
[2015-02-24 05:35:07] Dave_B_: personally I'm using nosetest to run my tests
[2015-02-24 05:35:23] sim2: using selenium server standalone 2.43.1 because of the bug in 2.44
[2015-02-24 05:35:24] Dave_B_: so my equivalent test would be….
[2015-02-24 05:37:43] sim2: at this point it might actually make sense for me to switch to nosetest, I know python much better than I know js, just had a look at the nose docs page and it looks good
[2015-02-24 05:39:50] Dave_B_: https://gist.github.com/daveberg/8d2f7feb9b015b0f65ce
[2015-02-24 05:40:19] Dave_B_: keeping the same calls in the same areas of the test etc
[2015-02-24 05:40:42] AutomatedTester: py.test ftw
[2015-02-24 05:40:56] wdj, quitting. ()
[2015-02-24 05:40:58] sim2: yeah looking at the code you sent reminded me why I really like python
[2015-02-24 05:42:32] Dave_B_: not sure where you're trying to get to, but what I actually do doesn't quite look like that as I use page objects to avoid rewriting stuff and having locators scattered through my code etc, but still
[2015-02-24 05:43:00] Dave_B_: (I'm sure the JS bindings can be good too, just was struggling to see why it wasn't working as am not familiar with them)
[2015-02-24 05:44:40] Dave_B_: also AutomatedTester is really good so if he advises something he probably has reasons :p
[2015-02-24 05:47:18] sim2: so the deal is, I work at a independent testing company, currently all our work is manual testing, but there are some clients interested in automated testing and my bosses want to know if we could viably offer it. So I'm currently researching this stuff, I have some coding knowledge, the test I was trying to do was just run something simple to see if it was working. The site that it was navigating contains a colour
[2015-02-24 05:47:18] sim2:  picker, so that's something I need to workout how to test. So it's the kinda thing we get from clients, so using that as a basis.
[2015-02-24 05:47:18] sim2: Using page objects does sound like something I want to use, as I do want to write more easily maintainable tests.
[2015-02-24 05:47:45] Dave_B_: page objects <3
[2015-02-24 05:51:37] sim2: that's something I'll look into
[2015-02-24 05:51:43] sim2: just installed nosetests
[2015-02-24 05:53:51] AutomatedTester: sim2: I recommend py.test as it has better hooks for your own extensions
[2015-02-24 05:54:08] sim2: oh ok
[2015-02-24 05:54:34] AutomatedTester: sim2: so at Mozilla we have a module that gets the used during setup and pulls in the necessary parts without having to write everything from scratch

[2015-02-24 07:54:10] AutomatedTester: the speed is not the profile, its the issue with having to start the browser twice

[2015-02-24 08:23:35] sircapsalot: awesome.  you work/worked for salesforce, correct?
[2015-02-24 08:23:58] jimevans: i do, yes. but please don't ask me about automating a salesforce-based app/website.
[2015-02-24 08:24:39] jimevans: (he said, hoping to forestall a long conversation that will inevitably lead to disappointment)
[2015-02-24 08:24:41] sircapsalot: i don't need your help *with* automating it, other than answering at least one question.  Does salesforce prevent selenium automation?  does it monitor the user agent, and reject it?
[2015-02-24 08:24:47] sircapsalot: sure :) i understand.
[2015-02-24 08:25:21] sircapsalot: I'll clear that "user agent" up by saying, my suite changes the user agent to "chrome-Selenium" for metrics
[2015-02-24 08:26:05] jimevans: afaik, there's no code in the salesforce app that does any type of detection specifically for prevention of automation with selenium/webdriver. in point of fact, we use selenium extensively in our automated tests of the product.
[2015-02-24 08:26:09] sircapsalot: Honestly, since salesforce has their own automation suite, i personally don't like the idea of even automating "our piece of salesforce"…. but the request came in.. gotta investigate

[2015-02-24 08:29:52] sircapsalot: well when i try to log in after setting username, password, and clicking login, it rejects my credentials saying something about "invalid location / time"  which i figured might be salesforce rejecting my useragent

[2015-02-24 08:31:00] jimevans: that'd be an easy test.

[2015-02-24 08:32:04] sircapsalot: so i set a debug point in the browser, opened up the Network panel in Chrome, and inspected the User Agent.. even after resetting the user agent it seems to reject it (even after manually setting the un/pw)

[2015-02-24 08:32:54] sircapsalot: I think i'll just fight back to the request by saying "why… why are we automating someone elses app"
[2015-02-24 08:32:55] sircapsalot: ;)
[2015-02-24 08:33:11] jimevans: you can ping lukeis too when he comes online.

[2015-02-24 08:36:25] sircapsalot: i think the end result will still be me explaining to the request why we shouldn't be automating someone elses app.  (they are wanting the case management solution to be automated and checking to see if it works)

[2015-02-24 10:00:40] sircapsalot: hey there! lukeis
[2015-02-24 10:01:37] sircapsalot: so I had a request come to me at my company regarding automating a piece of salesforce (basically they want to make sure that assigning cases, deleting cases, etc. works)
[2015-02-24 10:02:12] sircapsalot: now, i don't need help per se automating it.  I just have a few questions about salesforce:
[2015-02-24 10:02:27] lukeis: ok ;)
[2015-02-24 10:02:40] sircapsalot: to your knowledge, do you know if salesforce prevents selenium automation?  I know that you guys have 40k+ tests running with selenium.
[2015-02-24 10:02:50] lukeis: no, it does not prevent it
[2015-02-24 10:02:52] sircapsalot: I'm getting an issue logging into our salesforce instance, stating that i have an invalid location / time
[2015-02-24 10:04:50] sircapsalot: we change our selenium browser user agent for metrics purposes. it fails with that user agent, and another user agent.  ( I originally was under the assumption that the app refuses browsers that aren't "modern")
[2015-02-24 10:04:57] rananda, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2015-02-24 10:05:17] lukeis: that's possible ;)
[2015-02-24 10:05:51] lukeis: you should try to use the browsers you care about with selenium (user agent spoofing will lead to inconsistencies)
[2015-02-24 10:06:14] cristi, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2015-02-24 10:07:12] sircapsalot: i'm only using chrome.. we only care about chrome.  problem is though, i did :)  i did take out the user-agent change, and it still has that same behavior.  I set a debug point in the browser controlled by webdriver, and enter my info manually and it still fails there
[2015-02-24 10:08:39] sircapsalot: this is what i'm getting:  "Your login attempt has failed. The username or password may be incorrect, or your location or login time may be restricted"
[2015-02-24 10:08:42] sircapsalot: is this our side, or yours?
[2015-02-24 10:09:15] lukeis: your salesforce org could have a restriction on login
[2015-02-24 10:09:32] sircapsalot: but it works from a regular browser which is the intriguing part :)
[2015-02-24 10:09:34] lukeis: you'd have to check the settings (as an administrator on your side)
[2015-02-24 10:10:06] lukeis: i'd have to see what's happening… but there's no restriction we put on using selenium to automate our site
[2015-02-24 10:10:22] lukeis: sircapsalot: do you also have a api connection with your tests?
[2015-02-24 10:10:39] lukeis: cause you can bypass login by setting the session cookie provided with the api connection
[2015-02-24 10:10:42] sircapsalot: a connection to the salesforce api?
[2015-02-24 10:10:46] lukeis: yes
[2015-02-24 10:10:50] sircapsalot: negative
[2015-02-24 10:10:57] lukeis: would be preferable ;)
[2015-02-24 10:11:01] sircapsalot: hmm

[2015-02-24 11:15:14] lukeis: simonstewart: so… will 3.0 support native events for firefox (you know, assuming we're not using marionette)
[2015-02-24 11:15:30] simonstewart: Dunno
[2015-02-24 11:15:40] simonstewart: I don't have a handy linux or windows machine to experiment on
[2015-02-24 11:15:50] simonstewart: But we did discuss how to use js-ctypes to get the window handle
[2015-02-24 11:16:01] simonstewart: So we could (technically) get them back up and running again
[2015-02-24 11:16:05] lukeis: i think you were the only one seemingly willing to work on that
[2015-02-24 11:17:00] simonstewart: Then it's not happening in a hurry
[2015-02-24 11:17:54] lukeis: ok then we should make another point release soon (before 3.0) that fixes the latest firefox

[2015-02-24 11:18:00] lukeis: (for synthetic even)
[2015-02-24 11:18:27] simonstewart: OK. We should also deprecate the rc classes in the python tree

[2015-02-24 11:26:57] jleyba: Tested on Yosemite
[2015-02-24 11:28:10] dimacus: i'm gonna be scrubbing my whole os and upgradint to yosemite next week bc Safari died completely on my box and i figure best time to scrub the OS is after coming from ex soviet block country
[2015-02-24 11:28:27] jleyba: lol
[2015-02-24 11:30:59] Accipiter: Thanks everyone!
[2015-02-24 11:31:16] dimacus: seriously though, i have to VNC into a different OSX box just to compile the extension
[2015-02-24 11:32:07] jleyba: the build only depends on java7
[2015-02-24 11:33:08] dimacus: yeah but… if you can't even launch safari you can't do the final compile step
[2015-02-24 11:33:34] jleyba: oh you mean to actually package everything up into a .safariextz file
[2015-02-24 11:33:37] dimacus: also, getting 100% of the tests to pass has been dificult
[2015-02-24 11:33:51] dimacus: the cookies tests are killing me
[2015-02-24 11:34:01] dimacus: :yt killing me solftly
[2015-02-24 11:34:13] jleyba: Yeah, I had some problems with cookie tests last night
[2015-02-24 11:34:50] jleyba: The SafariDriver cannot open new windows via js.. I suspect Apple put some security restrictions in place to prevent you from working with cookies too
[2015-02-24 11:34:59] dimacus: yeah… like i mentioned in the doc… i'm tempted to just execute an AppleScript 1 liner to delete all cookies vs doing it in JS ;)
[2015-02-24 11:35:42] dimacus: i've been doing some reading of the API, it's possible to control the tabs, which one is in focus, closing and setting the current URL in one via AppleScript
[2015-02-24 11:35:45] jleyba: cookie commands need to be restricted to the current page's domain though
[2015-02-24 11:36:03] dimacus: too bad they don't give any more API hooks to control the browser
[2015-02-24 11:36:57] jleyba: Safari extensions are an after thought

[2015-02-24 12:49:21] dimacus: do you have DISPLAY exported and a GUI session running on that dispaly?
[2015-02-24 12:49:51] Guest89859: I dont, unless it's handled inside the docker file
[2015-02-24 12:50:04] Guest89859: well i didn't explicitly anyway
[2015-02-24 12:50:20] dimacus: that's the thing in linux display needs to be handle explicitly
[2015-02-24 12:51:01] dimacus: 90% of can't start firefox issues i've seen have to do with display not working properly
[2015-02-24 12:51:50] Guest89859: ah right, i'm using chrome, but i could git FF a shot and see what happens (also, ill do some googlefoo around exporting DISPLAY)
[2015-02-24 12:52:39] dimacus: so if you are not explicitly starting a GUI server like vnc or xvnc or flux box
[2015-02-24 12:53:11] dimacus: and explicitly not telling your ENV where you started it on
[2015-02-24 12:53:27] dimacus: no matter what browser you use it will not start since it needs gui on linux
[2015-02-24 12:56:45] Guest89859: ah ic. I guess i was under the assumption that i could just fire up the webapp, selenium hub and node, and then run protractor and it would "just work". Ill take a look at what it takes to do what you're suggesting.
[2015-02-24 12:57:32] dimacus: yeah simple test is this
[2015-02-24 12:57:40] dimacus: ssh into the box and run "firefox"
[2015-02-24 12:57:59] dimacus: if you cannot start an instance of firefox or chrome like that, than you need to explicitly set everything up
[2015-02-24 12:58:13] Guest89859: for reference or if it's unclear, these are the docker containers i'm using  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium
[2015-02-24 12:58:14] dimacus: and don't forget DISPLAY=:0 is reserved
[2015-02-24 12:58:30] jimevans: oh, hey, look firefox 36 is out.
[2015-02-24 12:58:40] dimacus: only to physically attached display, it's gonna wear you out make that work
[2015-02-24 12:59:04] dimacus: so make sure you use fluxbox or xnvc and start a dispaly, and then send the browser to that display
[2015-02-24 12:59:22] Guest89859: gotcha, that'll take a few minutes as i have to full around with pub/priv keys and such. Thanks ahead of time.
[2015-02-24 12:59:28] Guest89859: will do
[2015-02-24 13:00:00] sircapsalot: oh so jimevans,, apparently this wasn't the actual "salesforce" portal I was doing.. this was some sort of customized app from salesforce.

[2015-02-24 13:21:18] jimevans: if i'm hearing you correctly, you want to emulate what the java, .net, python, and ruby bindings do, right?
[2015-02-24 13:21:28] kallisti: yup
[2015-02-24 13:21:39] jimevans: in that you want to fire up chromedriver.exe or iedriverserver.exe directly
[2015-02-24 13:21:47] jimevans: rather than rely on the java bindings.
[2015-02-24 13:22:03] jimevans: and by "java bindings" i mean the standalone server.
[2015-02-24 13:22:11] kallisti: and use java server as a fallback yeah
[2015-02-24 13:22:50] jimevans: so what .net does, is it finds an open tcp port, then launches iedriverserver.exe or chromedriver.exe with the port specified on its command-line arguments.
[2015-02-24 13:23:16] jimevans: then polls via http on http://localhost:<port>/status for a valid response.
[2015-02-24 13:23:40] jimevans: java uses a similar mechanism, if memory serves.
[2015-02-24 13:24:07] kallisti: oh, you don't check for an existing server before launching a new one?
[2015-02-24 13:24:18] kallisti: for some reason I thought that was how it worked.
[2015-02-24 13:24:30] jimevans: nope. no way to know what port the server is listening on.
[2015-02-24 13:24:38] jimevans: and i'm not about to implement a port scanner.
[2015-02-24 13:25:42] jimevans: that's why it's so critically important to use driver.quit() instead of just driver.close() to shut down the browser.
[2015-02-24 13:28:38] jimevans: firefox, of course, is its own special brand of snowflakey goodness.

[2015-02-24 13:29:16] kallisti: IIRC firefox loads firefox with an extension that implements the server.
[2015-02-24 13:29:27] joshin4colours: jimevans: excellent line there
[2015-02-24 13:29:28] jimevans: but only in the sense that the HTTP server is started inside the browser, so you have to do a fair amount of manipulation to get the server set up properly beforehand
[2015-02-24 13:29:29] joshin4colours:  :)
[2015-02-24 13:29:35] kallisti: er, firefoxdriver, I guess. "firefox loads firefox" sounds weird to me.
[2015-02-24 13:30:13] jimevans: kallisti: yes, that's correct. but there's a lot more to "firefoxdriver loads firefox" than just starting up firefox.exe
[2015-02-24 13:31:09] kallisti: I would guess: create a temp directory, create a firefox profile containing the extension, point firefox to the temp directory
[2015-02-24 13:31:42] jimevans: lots of manipulation to get a clean, anonymous profile; add the webdriver extension to it; modify the setting of the profile to start the http server; launch firefox to make sure the profile is good; launch firefox again, this time with the profile fully activated, and able to be connected to.
[2015-02-24 13:32:46] jimevans: it's not particularly magic code, but it's not trivial either.
[2015-02-24 13:34:54] kallisti: well, the good news is that I can make a pretty trivial java server launcher and tack it onto my API, and do the firefox launcher later. :>
[2015-02-24 13:36:01] kallisti: not entirely sure what I'd be gaining from doing so, other than completeness.

[2015-02-24 13:51:24] kallisti: Kind of long overdue though. I didn't think it would really be worth adding, but I've gotten enough questions asking why they get a "connection not found" error to perhaps warrant it. :P
[2015-02-24 13:51:55] kallisti: even though I have (I think) pretty clear documentation for why the library would not work out of the box. ;)
