[2015-02-19 09:52:05] Ankit: I am facing an issue with Selenium 2.44, 2.43 + IE9 + Win7. During the flow, when I try to navigate to a page through a link. It goes there and returns back to some previous page of the navigation. Please help!
[2015-02-19 09:52:57] jimevans: Ankit: there's going to be no generic, simple answer to solving your problem. i've never heard of the driver spontaneously behaving that way.
[2015-02-19 09:53:36] WhereIsMySpoon: :sscce
[2015-02-19 09:53:42] WhereIsMySpoon: Ankit: ^

[2015-02-19 09:55:23] Ankit: There is no GUI related issue in it.
[2015-02-19 09:55:34] Ankit: With chrome it is working great.
[2015-02-19 09:55:45] Ankit: The issue is coming with IE only.
[2015-02-19 09:55:45] WhereIsMySpoon: those 2 sentences do not necessarily flow
[2015-02-19 09:55:50] lukeis: Ankit: you need to show us how to reproduce it
[2015-02-19 09:55:53] WhereIsMySpoon: ^
[2015-02-19 09:56:04] tony2, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-19 09:56:28] Ankit: Actually, its really difficult to reproduce on some different website.
[2015-02-19 09:56:39] Ankit: It is my client's application which is giving issue.
[2015-02-19 09:56:44] jleyba: ohai jimevans. welcome back
[2015-02-19 09:56:45] Ankit: But still, I'll say the flow
[2015-02-19 09:56:54] jimevans: jleyba: thanks
[2015-02-19 09:57:02] jleyba: have a good trip?
[2015-02-19 09:57:06] lukeis: Ankit: it's really difficult for us to help troubleshoot it then too ;)
[2015-02-19 09:57:13] Ankit: I need to do a search, after that a document opens up directly
[2015-02-19 09:57:15] jimevans: jleyba: an excellent one, yes.
[2015-02-19 09:57:34] Ankit: After that I need to go to settings page
[2015-02-19 09:57:37] WhereIsMySpoon: Ankit: what sort of "document"? you mean you're viewing a pdf or word doc in IE?
[2015-02-19 09:57:37] Ankit: When I go there
[2015-02-19 09:57:47] Ankit: The page returns to the homepage of search
[2015-02-19 09:58:01] Ankit: No, an HTMl document kind of....
[2015-02-19 09:58:16] Ankit: It is formatted in form of a document.
[2015-02-19 09:58:19] Ankit: But it is html
[2015-02-19 09:58:20] *lukeis gives up :)'
[2015-02-19 09:58:22] WhereIsMySpoon: Ankit: and does this happen when you manually do the flow?
[2015-02-19 09:58:33] Ankit: no, not manually
[2015-02-19 09:58:34] jleyba: jimevans: I started working on IE support for node.js last night. Didn't get very far - had two years worth of windows updates to install on the VM :(
[2015-02-19 09:58:56] jleyba: VM image was so old it had IE9 and Firefox 4 installed
[2015-02-19 09:59:04] jimevans: Ankit: what you're describing sounds incredibly specific to the site you're automating. without access to that site, or one that acts similarly, there's very, very little anyone will be able to help you with.
[2015-02-19 09:59:15] jimevans: jleyba: that's impressive.
[2015-02-19 09:59:18] WhereIsMySpoon: Ankit: im afraid this is going to be very difficult for us to help you with unless you give very specific instructions as to what sort of elements are being pressed, what commands are being run, what exceptions happen
[2015-02-19 09:59:41] WhereIsMySpoon: "i navigate somewhere and a html document opens up and then it goes back to the home page" is not useful
[2015-02-19 09:59:43] jimevans: :kittens
[2015-02-19 10:00:39] Ankit: Well, beyond the client office I don't have access to the application.
[2015-02-19 10:00:50] Ankit: So, I don't know which other site to refer to....

[2015-02-19 10:01:29] Ankit: The functions I am using
[2015-02-19 10:01:42] Ankit: The elements I am clicking....
[2015-02-19 10:02:15] Ankit: The functions are normal: findElement(By.cssSelector(dsds)).click();
[2015-02-19 10:02:15] jimevans: nope. i'm done. not getting sucked into this anymore.
[2015-02-19 10:02:33] jimevans: life's to short.
[2015-02-19 10:02:40] jimevans: and too short also
[2015-02-19 10:03:03] Ankit: and the elemts are dropdown menus
[2015-02-19 10:03:06] Ankit: from top toolbar
[2015-02-19 10:03:09] Ankit: elements*
[2015-02-19 10:03:27] jimevans: friend-of-a-friend disappeared last week, so i'm starting to reevaluate priorities.
[2015-02-19 10:04:06] WhereIsMySpoon: Ankit: you need to provide a page of html, the selenium code snippets you're using and the exceptions
[2015-02-19 10:04:09] WhereIsMySpoon: without that we cant help

[2015-02-19 10:05:01] Ankit: bbye
[2015-02-19 10:05:02] dude-x: i would bet that because you're using IE9 versus Chrome, that one of your locators does not work properly on IE9
[2015-02-19 10:05:32] dude-x: this could be because of things like jQuery using a slightly different structure of code on IE9
[2015-02-19 10:05:57] dude-x: this is most likely the problem
[2015-02-19 10:06:48] dude-x: the other problem is that your code has logic errors in terms of flow, that works ok on Chrome but is totally wrong on IE. (i've had this happen because i don't fully inspect the actual steps and locators used)

[2015-02-19 13:00:36] theneb_: Yes, nested paragraphs are a w3c error so that's no problem.
[2015-02-19 13:01:12] theneb_: lukeis: I'm writing functional tests. So I look for the parent then the child.
[2015-02-19 13:01:27] theneb_: The fact selenium is failing to find elements with bad HTML is a good thing.
[2015-02-19 13:02:36] lukeis: ok, then that works :)

[2015-02-19 14:09:03] mach6: ooh shiny new ones!  thx
[2015-02-19 14:09:24] lukeis: "new" … been a work in progress since Boston ;)

[2015-02-19 14:13:05] mach6: updates are only going to the "new" one?
[2015-02-19 14:13:25] mach6: I mean, I'm sure new releases and other trival changes still go into the "old" docs
[2015-02-19 14:13:26] lukeis: both
[2015-02-19 14:14:00] lukeis: to say the docs are frequently updated… heh… you know software developers maintain this right? ;)
[2015-02-19 14:15:23] mach6: yep. well aware of what that means.

[2015-02-19 14:25:03] Markw_: hi, any update on when 2.45 is coming out?
[2015-02-19 14:26:10] smccarthy: haha
[2015-02-19 14:27:26] jleyba: 2.45 is blocked on native event support for Firefox 35 (Mozilla removed an API we use)
[2015-02-19 14:28:42] Markw_: :) ok thanks
[2015-02-19 14:30:05] jleyba: to be honest, it's probably going to be a while. it will be a non-trivial fix and is a part of the code base that doesn't have a dedicated maintainer

[2015-02-19 15:42:41] jentron_: What method (c#) should I use if I want to search a page for any occurance of a text string?
[2015-02-19 15:47:13] dude-x: get page source, and then scan the entire text
[2015-02-19 15:47:20] dude-x: but getting the page source can be slow
[2015-02-19 15:48:09] lukeis: driver.FindElement(By.Xpath("//*[contains(., 'your text')");    # this will take a long time :)

[2015-02-19 15:49:17] lukeis: if you're finding things by text… You're doing it wrong™
[2015-02-19 15:50:49] jentron_: I'm just poking around a legacy app to play with selenium... I'm hoping to get the devs to use IDs on important things in the real app
[2015-02-19 15:52:06] jentron_: I'm just noticing the xpaths I copied out of firefox/firebug don't map in IE9
[2015-02-19 15:52:22] ato: mach6: Yeah, so the new docs aren't quite good enough for us to abandon our old ones yet.
[2015-02-19 15:52:39] ato: mach6: But patches welcome (-:
[2015-02-19 15:52:53] lukeis: mach6: meet the new docs maintainer ^^  ;)
[2015-02-19 15:52:59] ato: Dammit.
[2015-02-19 15:53:02] lukeis: :-D
[2015-02-19 15:53:18] mach6: ato: that makes sense. hello new maintainer. :)
[2015-02-19 15:53:36] jentron_: Docs? /me thought this was an opensource project. :P
[2015-02-19 15:53:51] lukeis: indeed
[2015-02-19 15:54:04] ato: Unconventional, I know.
[2015-02-19 15:54:12] mach6: well, tbh I started the question about artwork.. not strictly "docs" :)
[2015-02-19 15:54:28] ato: I didn't read the backlog, sorry.
[2015-02-19 15:54:31] lukeis: i'm currently trying to use another open source project… docs are basically non-existent.
[2015-02-19 15:54:45] mach6: docs need artwork too.. right?
[2015-02-19 15:54:50] lukeis: yes :)
[2015-02-19 15:54:50] ato: Right.
[2015-02-19 15:55:05] ato: Contributing artwork, new website design, cleanups, anything.
[2015-02-19 15:57:26] mach6: great. I've already conveyed the message to the co-worker that pinged me re: "cleaning up" the Se logo artwork and contributing it back.. so let's see where that goes.. beyond that, I'll keep it in mind.
[2015-02-19 15:57:48] lukeis: heh, i just did an image search for selenium…. this should be our new logo  http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/archive/2010/07/1_123125_2257175_2257248_100702_bpt_selenium34.jpg.CROP.original-original.jpg
[2015-02-19 15:57:59] ato: mach6: Thanks in advance.  If there's anything, I'm always aronud in this channel.
[2015-02-19 15:58:13] mach6: lukeis: rofl
[2015-02-19 15:58:22] ato: So I think my ISP's DNS server just died.
