[2015-02-27 10:06:32] jeffszusz: hey guys; i'm having a strange problem. I've got my tests (selenium + webdriverjs + protractor) running just fine with both chrome and phantomjs on my local box. for some reason when we run them on our jenkins box with phantom, there's an error "CancellationError: UnknownError: Session [2dfd1e60-bea2-11e4-ae93-b5b1cb017e17] was terminated due to FORWARDING_TO_NODE_FAILED"
[2015-02-27 10:06:38] fp_: Good to know. Thank you so much for the quick replies.
[2015-02-27 10:06:49] jeffszusz: the weird part is that we have an almost identical setup running for another project on the same jenkins server

[2015-02-27 10:07:25] jeffszusz: is there anything in particular that I should be checking in the configuration to determine what could be mismatched?
[2015-02-27 10:08:32] jleyba: jeffszusz Hard to say without access to the code. CancellationErrors usually indicate there is an unhandled promise rejection

[2015-02-27 10:12:04] jeffszusz: unhandled promise rejection with a webdriver.promise.Promise ?
[2015-02-27 10:12:59] jeffszusz: ok thanks jleyba I'll take a cruise through our code and make sure they're all handled
[2015-02-27 10:13:26] jleyba: Specially, a promise is being rejected with "FORWARDING_TO_NODE_FAILED" (phantomjs-specific error?)
[2015-02-27 10:13:57] jleyba: That's not being caught properly, so the control flow is aborting scheduled tasks (hence CancellationError)
[2015-02-27 10:15:39] jeffszusz: ooo
[2015-02-27 10:15:40] jeffszusz: ok
[2015-02-27 10:15:41] jeffszusz: great
[2015-02-27 10:16:16] jleyba: Entirely possible it's a bug in selenium-webdriver itself though :)
[2015-02-27 10:16:56] jeffszusz: it's highly likely we've missed a bunch of 'reject' cases

I'm using saucelabs to run those tests. When I run login test against safari, it types in username correctly, password correctly and when it clicks login button, it says credentials are not valid.
[2015-02-27 13:12:14] dhinchak: Using same credentials I'm able to login to safari manually. But when I user WebDriver it fails.
[2015-02-27 13:12:14] dhinchak: Here are my configurations -

[2015-02-27 17:22:43] dhinchak: I'm running into strange issue. I've a login test created using ruby/web driver that works on ie (8,9,10,11), all major versions of chrome and firefox. I'm using saucelabs to run those tests. When I run login test against safari, it types in username correctly, password correctly and when it clicks login button, it says credentials are not valid.
[2015-02-27 17:22:43] dhinchak: Using same credentials I'm able to login to safari manually. But when I user WebDriver it fails.
