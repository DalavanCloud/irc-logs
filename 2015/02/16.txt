[2015-02-16 22:12:52] Joe____: Hello, guys! Is it possible to take a screen shot with browser's frame in Selenium WebDriver. I'm using line like this "File scrFile = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);" to take screen shot. When I take a screen shot, I need to save URL that been displayed on opened page. But this screen only gives me content of the page.

[2015-02-16 23:38:47] Joe____: ato: But how to do that in selenium? I readed many forums and not found situation as I have.

[2015-02-16 23:39:54] ato: Joe____: Load a frame individually? Iterate the frame handles and get the URL for the frame. Then navigate to that.
[2015-02-16 23:42:47] Joe____: I think I described my problem not clearly :) It is no need to navigate to URL. Just do spanshot it in URL-address field.
