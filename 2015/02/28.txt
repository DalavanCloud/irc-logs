[2015-02-28 13:50:29] AutomatedTester: so... literally no one cares
[2015-02-28 13:50:47] barancev: I don't care about Se IDE
[2015-02-28 13:50:56] barancev: but I do care about Se Builder
[2015-02-28 13:51:11] AutomatedTester: barancev: so... builder has the same problem
[2015-02-28 13:51:15] AutomatedTester: and yet... no reply
[2015-02-28 13:51:27] ato: I've been watching how Servo, in particular, are picking out issues that the devs file and feel they haven't got time for or which would be suitable to onboard new contributors, or that the community files, and label them as Easy targets.
[2015-02-28 13:51:56] ato: So that anyone who comes a long and thinks it would be interesting to get involved with the project could just filter by that.
[2015-02-28 13:52:19] AutomatedTester: ato: we tried that before but GC might have limited the interaction
[2015-02-28 13:52:29] barancev: we used to set GettingInvolved label
[2015-02-28 13:53:25] ato: They also have a bot that picks up on new contributors filing their first two-three PRs, and greets them with the information they need to know as new contributors.  Basically it says “hi, welcome, and thank you” and that a contributor will look at this shortly.
[2015-02-28 13:53:56] lukeis: and "have you signed the cla?" ? :)
[2015-02-28 13:54:11] ato: Thirdly, and perhaps most controversial, they have a bot that auto-assigns new PRs to an active committer.
[2015-02-28 13:54:31] lukeis: define "active"? :)
[2015-02-28 13:54:44] ato: About the CLA, that's another thing I want to discuss.  Is that thing really necessary these days?
[2015-02-28 13:54:45] AutomatedTester: definite committer
[2015-02-28 13:55:06] lukeis: ask simon...
[2015-02-28 13:55:22] ato: I think the algorithm they use is pretty dumb and that this aspect is not necessarily the best idea.
[2015-02-28 13:56:02] ato: But I do think it's worth having a greeter bot that says something like “if noone looks at this, please refer to this list of commiters and feel free to @-ping them in this PR to get a response”.
[2015-02-28 13:56:23] barancev: btw, the next driver to get rid of should be HtmlUnitDriver
[2015-02-28 13:56:24] ato: My experience is that people usually respond when you approach them directly.
[2015-02-28 13:56:29] ato: barancev: ++
[2015-02-28 13:59:02] AutomatedTester: so... the CLA is an interesting conversation to be had
[2015-02-28 13:59:30] ato: Personally I believe the CLA isn't necessary, but that's only to the (very limited) extent of my understanding of US law.
[2015-02-28 14:00:04] lukeis: i don't understand US law either…  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-02-28 14:00:07] ato: Basically the idea is that we need to assign the copyright to a single entity so that we can more easily make project-wide licensing related changes.
[2015-02-28 14:00:21] ato: That made a whole lot of sense when Google Inc. owned the copyright.
[2015-02-28 14:00:25] AutomatedTester: US has law?
[2015-02-28 14:00:56] barancev: pretend it has
[2015-02-28 14:01:18] AutomatedTester: barancev: I think it has similar amount of laws as Russia ;)
[2015-02-28 14:01:24] ato: But if the CLA /is/ necessary, we should take steps to minimise the pain involved for all parts.
[2015-02-28 14:01:56] barancev: AutomatedTester: pretend Russia has law too :)
[2015-02-28 14:02:39] ato: For example it be nice if it wasn't so hard to check if the committer had signed the CLA.  With a bot that checked against the Google Forms list and added a paragraph about signing it, it would dramatically improve the feedback loop for the new contributor, and the the life of us as reviewers.
[2015-02-28 14:03:35] AutomatedTester: yes
[2015-02-28 14:03:46] ato: Additionally we should exploit Github labels so that if a PR lacks a CLA signature, we'd label it with something like Awaits-CLA-Signing.
[2015-02-28 14:04:14] ato: Or Awaits-Rebase if it needs to be rebased or Awaits-Review if it's a complicated change.
[2015-02-28 14:04:36] AutomatedTester: Awaits-Steak
[2015-02-28 14:04:43] ato: This is one of my gripes with all of the PRs we currently have open; I have no idea which of them makes sense.
[2015-02-28 14:04:51] ato: Also we shouldn't be so afraid of refusing PRs.

[2015-02-28 14:08:45] lukeis: it's for mobile… Native vs. WebView when automating hybrid apps
[2015-02-28 14:08:57] lukeis: it's what ios-driver, selendroid, appium use
[2015-02-28 14:09:03] AutomatedTester: so we assume people dont know where they are?
[2015-02-28 14:09:22] lukeis: what?
[2015-02-28 14:09:41] lukeis: it's basically akin to Window handle switching
[2015-02-28 14:10:15] *AutomatedTester was thinking it was more like frame switching'
[2015-02-28 14:10:42] lukeis: similar i suppose, but not quite :)
[2015-02-28 14:10:50] AutomatedTester: frame switching doesnt have get active frame
[2015-02-28 14:11:19] lukeis: we added it to the mobile spec for kindness
[2015-02-28 14:12:16] *AutomatedTester wonders if this will hamper people writing deterministic code'

[2015-02-28 14:29:32] ato: Yeah.  I we should prioritise and focus on what has the biggest impact.
[2015-02-28 14:29:51] ato: Like, I don't think it's a priority to do anything about the website just yet.
