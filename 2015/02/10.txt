[2015-02-10 01:38:54] Ashwee: I'm trying to set a field on an angularJs app using latest selenium and latest ie driver in ie11. When I set the field values the they blank out. Things I have tried: SendKeys and tab away, SendKeys and call blur (via js), SendKeys and call change (via js), Set the underlying angular field by stealing the scope from the DOM. Nothing appears to work :(

[2015-02-10 03:39:55] Ashwee: then just a standard: var driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri("http://localhost:4444/wd/hub"), DesiredCapabilities.InternetExplorer(), TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));

[2015-02-10 10:49:05] Ankit: There when you scroll, a navigation bar will follow down.
[2015-02-10 10:49:33] Ankit: But if you want to click something, then the navigation bar covers it and doesn't let you click the particular link.
[2015-02-10 10:50:57] shteou: Is it a navigation bar? Or is it an EU cookie directive dropdown? In which case the solution would be to wait for the dropdown to appear, close it, then continue with your test
[2015-02-10 10:51:47] Ankit: No nno, it is a navigation bar which follows when you scroll down the page.
[2015-02-10 10:58:07] shteou: So I guess the link is scrolled to, and then the navbar obscures the link? (Whereas the user would scroll to a different location). 2 solutions: 1) Do some keyboard (pageup/down) or element-based scroll to get it out of view 2) Hide the navbar to click it
[2015-02-10 10:59:10] Ankit: Ya, the navbar hides the link.
[2015-02-10 10:59:13] shteou: It's hard to say without very specific steps and a loose description, especially when sites can be different between regions etc.
[2015-02-10 10:59:16] Ankit: I can't hide the navbar
[2015-02-10 10:59:40] shteou: Ankit: You can do almost anything, you can execute javascript which would hide it if it were absolutely necessary
[2015-02-10 11:00:03] shteou: Unfortunately selenium doesn't know much about the structure of the page, where overlays should be etc.
[2015-02-10 11:00:12] Ankit: How can I run javascript to hide the navbar?
[2015-02-10 11:00:15] Ankit: Please suggest.
[2015-02-10 11:00:41] Ankit: Can I remove the whole navbar by javascripts?
[2015-02-10 11:00:51] Ankit: How?
[2015-02-10 11:03:37] shteou: You probably can, as some hints for where to look. 1) Take a look at the JavascriptExecutor (or equivalent for your language bindings) 2) Try locating the navbar element in the DOM (using firebug or chrome devtools or whatever you fancy) and setting its css display value to 'none'
[2015-02-10 11:03:55] shteou: then execute the code from #2 using the JavascriptExecutor from #1

[2015-02-10 12:49:02] jmartin9589: Wondering about best practices. Should I 1) just be running N node-chrome containers if I want to run 5 specs in parallel 2) try to configure the node-chrome container at runtime or 3) build my own container based on node-chrome and set maxInstances/maxSessions via Dockerfile?
[2015-02-10 12:49:34] jmartin9589: Using the official selenium containers btw.
[2015-02-10 12:51:30] jmartin9589: I noticed the hub image uses an ENV called "GRID_MAX_SESSION" which defautls to 5, but that doesn't seem to have much to do with the nodes. They still configure themselves with maxInstance/maxSession = 1.
[2015-02-10 12:53:19] davehunt, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2015-02-10 12:53:35] jmartin9589: So I could just create a bunch of node-chrome containers and register them to the same hub, but I don't actually need to test in different browsers/versions, I just want to run specs in parallel, so configuring the node itself seems a little cleaner.

[2015-02-10 13:11:24] dimacus: why would firefoxDriver say an element is visible when it's covered by another element, while Chrome correctly says it's not visible and not clickable
[2015-02-10 13:13:32] swampdragons, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-10 13:15:45] jleyba: what is the exact error you get from chrome?
[2015-02-10 13:16:16] dimacus: so i have a button that gets hidden under the footer, so the element is not visible
[2015-02-10 13:16:29] dimacus: the error in chrome is "Element is not clicakble" as expected
[2015-02-10 13:16:40] dimacus: for some reason Firefox still allows a click though
[2015-02-10 13:16:56] jleyba: for click Chrome picks coordinates, then does a hit test to make sure the target element will actually receive the click
[2015-02-10 13:16:59] dimacus: idk if that's that big of a deal to be honest… someone is trying to test layout… and i think that's not a good idea
[2015-02-10 13:17:08] dimacus: ahhh
[2015-02-10 13:17:43] jleyba: We do not do the hit test in Firefox (we probably could though, it's a glorified elementFromPoint)
[2015-02-10 13:17:58] dimacus: gotcha
[2015-02-10 13:18:02] barancev: write this to the spec
[2015-02-10 13:18:12] dimacus: wc3 spec?
[2015-02-10 13:18:30] jleyba: Chrome added this behavior b/c there is a race b/w it computing click location and issuing the click command
[2015-02-10 13:18:43] jleyba: and there was a problem with animated menus not receiving clicks

[2015-02-10 13:20:02] dimacus: should i file an issue request or as barancev says to add it to the spec?
[2015-02-10 13:20:04] jleyba: something like "if elementFromPoint(clickX,clickY) does not return the target element or one of its descendants, return an element not clickable error"
[2015-02-10 13:20:24] barancev: dimacus: in general no. let's suppose there is a link with an image. you can't click the link because it is covered by the image
[2015-02-10 13:20:47] dimacus: hmmm valid point
[2015-02-10 13:21:26] jleyba: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/test/chromedriver/element_util.cc&q=%22Element%20is%20not%20clickable%22&sq=package:chromium&type=cs&l=92
[2015-02-10 13:21:53] barancev: jleyba's point on descendants improves the algorithm, but adds complexity
[2015-02-10 13:21:56] jleyba: which ultimately calls: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/chrome-driver/atoms.js#L207
[2015-02-10 13:22:07] jleyba: so looks like chrome is just using code in our repo that we don't use >:)
[2015-02-10 13:22:09] andy_seit, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-02-10 13:22:11] barancev: because it requires visibility calculation for descendants
[2015-02-10 13:22:20] dimacus: true
[2015-02-10 13:22:38] dimacus: so it becomes a bit of a philosophical issue… does selenium test Layout?
[2015-02-10 13:22:51] dimacus: if it does, then we have to implement on every browser, if no, than it's an extra
[2015-02-10 13:23:04] jleyba: dimacus: lots of teams here do image diff testing with selenium
[2015-02-10 13:23:23] jleyba: but i don't know of anyone testing layout in terms of "can i click here"
[2015-02-10 13:24:15] dimacus: that's a tough one…
[2015-02-10 13:25:19] jleyba: ideally selenium should be able to handle this
[2015-02-10 13:25:45] jleyba: but the reality is we don't handle z-index and css3 transforms very well
[2015-02-10 13:26:01] AutomatedTester: because they are dark magic

[2015-02-10 13:28:33] AutomatedTester: because as more css specs come to fruition we are going be battling uphill to keep on top of this

[2015-02-10 13:33:11] jleyba: We could change it to be super inefficient and just do elementFromPoint hit testing over the bounding box
[2015-02-10 13:33:13] AutomatedTester: since it's implicitly called by send_keys/click etc

[2015-02-10 14:01:47] barancev: "focusable" means "able to get focus" that's a different notion
[2015-02-10 14:03:25] ravenzz: I need my window size to be larger than the screen, but it seems to be impossible to do so with webdriver
[2015-02-10 14:03:27] ravenzz: is that correct?
