[2015-04-07 09:14:16] jimevans: okay open question about file upload elements (<input type="file">
[2015-04-07 09:14:17] jimevans: )
[2015-04-07 09:14:51] jimevans: currently, many javascript widget frameworks make those elements transparent/invisible so as to make their upload experience pretty.
[2015-04-07 09:15:37] jimevans: the firefox and chrome drivers handle that case so that the user can use sendKeys() to upload a file, even though the upload element is not "displayed".
[2015-04-07 09:15:50] jimevans: this is in violation of the current reading of the w3c spec.
[2015-04-07 09:16:14] tony3, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-07 09:16:20] jimevans: the IE driver throws an exception when the user attempts to manipulate such elements via sendKeys
[2015-04-07 09:16:26] ato: The spec is wrong in this area on so many ways.
[2015-04-07 09:16:49] jimevans: should the IE driver conform to the spec, or mimic the behavior of other browser implementations?
[2015-04-07 09:17:03] jimevans: simonstewart, barancev, feel free to chime in.
[2015-04-07 09:17:33] jimevans: AutomatedTester, you too.
[2015-04-07 09:17:45] barancev: I'l like the spec to be fixed first
[2015-04-07 09:18:10] jimevans: ive given up arguing what i think behavior should be. somebody just tell me what they want.

[2015-04-07 09:23:42] nolanlawson: I'm trying to use it in a node server that spins up a phantomjs process in order to take screenshots of a web page
[2015-04-07 09:23:55] nolanlawson: I suppose the currently state of the art for that would be nightwatch.js or something?
[2015-04-07 09:23:58] WhereIsMySpoon: o.O
[2015-04-07 09:24:09] WhereIsMySpoon: you dont need selenium for that im sure

[2015-04-07 09:28:05] Dave_B_: I'd have thought it only needs to be up for a few secondss to load the page and take the screenie, rather than up all the time

[2015-04-07 09:29:08] nolanlawson: WhereIsMySpoon: that's kind of where I'm going. wait for the selenium process to start throwing errors, then restart it

[2015-04-07 09:29:34] nolanlawson: still, seems that the best WD implementation out there is tied to selenium, so I'm not really sure how to get screenshots from phantomjs otherwise. y'all have done a great job with selenium

[2015-04-07 09:35:25] jimevans: as long as you don't have to actually manipulate the web page in any way, and can navigate directly to the URL in question, that's the way to go, i think.

[2015-04-07 12:26:47] AutomatedTester: jimevans: if this is about cookie I am about to push my final finishing touches to the spec that MS are free to bikeshed on
[2015-04-07 12:28:14] jimevans: AutomatedTester: well, no, this particular thing is "handling <input type='file'> elements, where the element has been made to be 'invisible'"
[2015-04-07 12:28:41] jimevans: the cookie thing is just another damned bug in the bug tracker(s) against the IE driver that can't be fixed.
[2015-04-07 12:29:07] AutomatedTester: jimevans: if its invisible, how does a user interact with it?
[2015-04-07 12:30:07] jimevans: AutomatedTester: in many javascript widget toolkits, it's simply transparent, and an underlying element styled to be "sooper awesumz looking" underneath is used for the visual element.
[2015-04-07 12:30:23] jimevans: which is why i put "invisible" in scare quotes.
[2015-04-07 12:30:28] AutomatedTester: ahh... opacity...
[2015-04-07 12:30:58] *AutomatedTester points at the "edge" case for getting rid of isDisplayed'
[2015-04-07 12:31:32] jimevans: and firefox and chrome drivers handle that case fine (without bringing up a file selection dialog because privileged driver contexts), but IE doesn't
[2015-04-07 12:33:26] jimevans: AutomatedTester: knowing whether or not an element is visible* is a useful thing
[2015-04-07 12:33:37] jimevans: *for some definition of the word "visible"

[2015-04-07 12:34:41] AutomatedTester: so, is IE showing the dialog when it shouldnt?
[2015-04-07 12:35:43] barancev: interactable != displayed
[2015-04-07 12:35:43] jimevans: AutomatedTester: no, the IE driver throws, saying "you can't interact with an invisible element, jackass"
[2015-04-07 12:36:21] jimevans: and frankly, i'm tired of getting pinged via email with issue comments that i can't do a damned thing about.
[2015-04-07 12:36:26] AutomatedTester: but chrome and FF show the dialoug?
[2015-04-07 12:36:33] AutomatedTester: dialog?
[2015-04-07 12:36:52] jimevans: AutomatedTester: no, in point of fact, they don't, but they *do* upload the file.

[2015-04-07 12:37:57] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I think chrome and FF are wrong here
[2015-04-07 12:38:07] AutomatedTester: from your tl;dr;

[2015-04-07 12:42:21] jleyba: right.  so FF and Chrome go "oh a file input, let me attach that value for you".  IE needs to click the button to bring up the dialog and fill in the path

[2015-04-07 12:42:52] barancev: it is *possible* to click an element with zero opacity

[2015-04-07 12:43:18] jimevans: i just haven't done that.
[2015-04-07 12:43:30] barancev: and we should allow to interact with transparent elements
[2015-04-07 12:43:36] barancev: I mean, allow by the spec

[2015-04-07 12:57:37] jleyba: barancev, reading the definition of "displayedness", doesn't sound like opacity counts at all
[2015-04-07 12:58:16] barancev: jleyba: ato wants to add it, iiuc :)
[2015-04-07 12:59:15] jleyba: but for the problem at hand, if jimevans were to support <input type=file style="opacity:0">, the IE driver would still be compliant

[2015-04-07 13:02:03] jleyba: yes, and opacity:0 does not count as "not displayed"
[2015-04-07 13:02:24] jleyba: based on the algorithm currently in the spec

[2015-04-07 15:45:25] hernan: i have an android-x86 machine. I want to use selenium on it
[2015-04-07 15:45:30] hernan: whats the recommended way ?
[2015-04-07 15:46:58] mekhami, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-07 15:47:13] dude-x, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-04-07 15:48:22] mekhami: i'm going to be working on creating a test suite for a client soon. putting their custom cms (built on php) under test. i'm more than likely going to be able to do the functional testing with python and selenium. there are a few things i wanna try to understand before i begin
[2015-04-07 15:48:44] mekhami: the most important of which is how to handle database interactions. obviously being a CMS it's pretty important.
[2015-04-07 15:49:00] mekhami: do you spin up a test database when you run your functional tests?
[2015-04-07 15:49:44] mekhami: the client will mostly likely be able to/want to set up an entire stack for the test system
[2015-04-07 15:54:27] dcboycm, quitting. ()
[2015-04-07 15:57:57] hernan: mekhami: how does selenium relates to database ?
[2015-04-07 15:58:02] hernan: that makes no sense for me...
[2015-04-07 15:58:26] hernan: im a selenium noob, but it seems obvious selenium will not talk directly to database...
[2015-04-07 15:59:15] hernan: with selenium you will test the interface... and that might talk with database..
[2015-04-07 15:59:17] mekhami: if i use selenium to create an article in my CMS, I want to be able to navigate to that article. if it's not in a database somehow, how will i see my content on the next page?
[2015-04-07 15:59:34] hernan: you wont see it because its not on the database
[2015-04-07 15:59:45] mekhami: i'm not talking about 'how does selenium use the database' i'm talking about 'how do people making functional tests manage database stuff'
[2015-04-07 15:59:48] hernan: you might go to post index and search it there
[2015-04-07 16:00:09] hernan: you need a page that lists "latest posts"
[2015-04-07 16:00:21] hernan: then you create a post and go to that page and make sure it has been created
[2015-04-07 16:00:24] mekhami: okay so tell me, how do i ever see latest posts that are never saved to a database
[2015-04-07 16:00:46] hernan: you wont see them because you never saved...
[2015-04-07 16:00:50] hernan: what nonsense ..
[2015-04-07 16:00:51] mekhami: okay nevermind please
[2015-04-07 16:00:54] mekhami: just stop
[2015-04-07 16:01:04] mekhami: if you don't get it you don't get it and that's okay
[2015-04-07 16:01:14] hernan: explain better then
[2015-04-07 16:01:22] hernan: lets make a test case...
[2015-04-07 16:01:22] mekhami: reading comprehension is hard
[2015-04-07 16:01:50] mekhami: "how do you manage database interactions in large scale functional test frameworks"
[2015-04-07 16:01:52] mekhami: how is this so difficult
[2015-04-07 16:01:58] mekhami: if you don't know then just don't say anything
[2015-04-07 16:03:03] hernan: maybe you want unit tests ?
[2015-04-07 16:03:16] mekhami: stop
[2015-04-07 16:03:38] hernan: no..
[2015-04-07 16:03:42] hernan: help me understand
[2015-04-07 16:03:48] mekhami: "how do you manage database interactions in large scale functional test frameworks"
[2015-04-07 16:03:49] hernan: maybe someone else will jump in and help
[2015-04-07 16:04:24] hernan: thats a bit vague i belive
[2015-04-07 16:04:36] mekhami: which is why i said
[2015-04-07 16:04:46] mekhami: <mekhami> do you spin up a test database when you run your functional tests?
[2015-04-07 16:04:46] mekhami: <mekhami> the client will mostly likely be able to/want to set up an entire stack for the test system
[2015-04-07 16:05:10] mekhami: do you just have a test database and you create/drop the table when you run the tests?
[2015-04-07 16:05:23] mekhami: obviously there needs to be isolation or your tests will never pass
[2015-04-07 16:06:08] hernan: i prefer to start fresh... ie. make python deploy a fresh test-system-environment. Then start selenium tests
[2015-04-07 16:06:59] mekhami: this client will (probably) want to run these tests on a dedicated AWS server. is that feasible?
[2015-04-07 16:07:06] mekhami: (this is just based on limited preliminary knowledge i have)
[2015-04-07 16:07:39] hernan: yeah, you will create a fresh instance with clean databases and run the tests which can be.. create a user, then make some posts
[2015-04-07 16:08:05] hernan: that would work best i belive
[2015-04-07 16:08:40] mekhami: so when i want to run tests, i'd spin up a new instance, then tear it down at the end
[2015-04-07 16:08:54] hernan: yeah
[2015-04-07 16:09:11] mekhami: that's the kinda info i'm looking for
[2015-04-07 16:09:12] mekhami: thank you.
