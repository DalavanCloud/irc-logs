[2015-04-27 07:54:06] mekhami: hi folks. I have a few questions. The first is about this issue: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/issues/14 it still seems to be a problem as I had to use the solution provided at the bottom to fix my node/hub issue. sircapsalot you remember what i was going through? it turned out to be this. should this solution already be rolled into the standalone server? I'm wondering if I should be trying to bring some light onto this.
[2015-04-27 07:56:16] mekhami: the second question is about workflow. I understand the benefit of the grid in a CI system where you might be running hundreds of tests and it'll take ages to run them one at a time. but would individual developers run their tests against a grid? it doesn't seem like they would because most often devs would be running their app on localhost which, the test running on the node can't point the driver to localhost? but i'm sure i'm really misunderstanding
[2015-04-27 07:56:17] mekhami:  something here.

[2015-04-27 08:09:38] smccarthy: lol no worries.
[2015-04-27 08:10:02] dimacus: i did a ton of homework to disable firefox auto updates post silent install

[2015-04-27 08:11:44] dimacus: it better be ANSI encoding on windows
[2015-04-27 08:12:27] dimacus: bc deity forgive if it's UTF8 or any other encoding, firefox will ignore them
[2015-04-27 08:12:50] smccarthy: oh.
[2015-04-27 08:13:12] dimacus: yeah spent 2 days debuging that
[2015-04-27 08:13:30] dimacus: bc for some reason when i would write the config files via script it woud be ignored
[2015-04-27 08:13:39] dimacus: but when i wrote the same script via notepad it would work
[2015-04-27 08:14:52] dimacus: went through so many permissions configs etc… seriously that's messed up

[2015-04-27 08:30:53] mekhami: yeah, i just can't wait 24+ hours to make progress on this.

[2015-04-27 08:31:45] mhall_work: NOW you can repost the question :p
[2015-04-27 08:31:45] mekhami: 	the second question is about workflow. I understand the benefit of the grid in a CI system where you might be running hundreds of tests and it'll take ages to run them one at a time. but would individual developers run their tests against a grid? it doesn't seem like they would because most often devs would be running their app on localhost which, the test running on the node can't point the driver to localhost? but i'm sure i'm really misunderstanding
[2015-04-27 08:31:47] mekhami: something here.
[2015-04-27 08:32:07] mekhami: my question itself is worded poorly because i'm not really coming from a good frame of reference.

[2015-04-27 08:32:58] mekhami: I just want to know how would a large team use selenium grid. i have the servers running, finally, but without pushing code to a singular test server, they obviously can't test local changes running on their local machine using the grid.
[2015-04-27 08:33:03] dimacus: mekhami: so grid is useful when yo uwant to spread the coverage against multiple "os's"

[2015-04-27 08:33:18] mekhami: same here
[2015-04-27 08:33:25] dimacus: so they do point their local tests to the grid
[2015-04-27 08:33:33] dimacus: to get IE9, 10, 11 coverage

[2015-04-27 08:33:49] mekhami: okay so that's what i don't understand
[2015-04-27 08:34:06] mekhami: for example, i've got a simple test case, RemoteWebDriver pointed to the hub with desired capability whatever.
[2015-04-27 08:34:18] dimacus: aha
[2015-04-27 08:34:20] mekhami: But I'm pointing the webdriver to localhost in the test
[2015-04-27 08:34:32] mekhami: which, when it runs on the grid, doesn't have access to the localhost on the vm on my notebook

[2015-04-27 08:35:08] dimacus: mekhami: don't use localhost
[2015-04-27 08:35:09] dimacus: use ip
[2015-04-27 08:35:26] dimacus: this whay when you rh tests on say http://11.12.13.14:555
[2015-04-27 08:35:32] mekhami: dimacus so i'd run the tests against my notebooks public ip?
[2015-04-27 08:35:34] dimacus: your tests will run against your local machine

[2015-04-27 08:37:00] mekhami: okay. so, given that these tests would need to be source controlled, how do you not commit your ip addresses? use environment variables or something?

[2015-04-27 08:37:25] mekhami: python

[2015-04-27 08:38:28] mhall_work: I just don't have much grid experience. We achieve parallelism in a different way
[2015-04-27 08:38:40] epteixeira, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-27 08:38:43] mhall_work: Otherwise I'd take a shot
[2015-04-27 08:39:38] dimacus: mekhami: so basically when you are building the URL for the grid tests, you will get the IP of the machine you are hosting the test site with the python's get ip method
[2015-04-27 08:40:20] mekhami: okay
[2015-04-27 08:40:30] mekhami: i think i understand what's going on there.
[2015-04-27 08:41:01] dimacus: mekhami: when dealing with grid, assume that every test is running from some other computer on your networks… so you have to think outside in… as in if your machine has a CSV file  you need to uplaod… that means that you need to make sure that any other machine outside of yours has access to that csv file

[2015-04-27 08:43:27] mhall_work: I hear ya
[2015-04-27 08:43:28] dimacus: mekhami: this is very similar situation if  you are using sauce labs etc..
[2015-04-27 08:43:45] dimacus: basically any reference to localhost or 127.0.0.01 are a big no no
[2015-04-27 08:43:51] mekhami: dimacus this is onboarding for a new major client, so i have no current infrastructure
[2015-04-27 08:43:54] dimacus: have to be IP or hostname
[2015-04-27 08:44:07] dimacus: yeah that's fine
[2015-04-27 08:44:19] dimacus: just keep that in mind localhost is the enemey
[2015-04-27 08:44:24] Selenium-Github: [13selenium] 15rbri opened pull request #496: Update to Htmluni  2 16 (06master...06htmluni_-2_16) 02http://git.io/vfQaZ
[2015-04-27 08:44:34] mhall_work: so, for my java suite, I just have two different constructors in our baseTest. One stays commented out. It let's us run our tests locally without needing to use CI or any other external resources
[2015-04-27 08:44:59] dawoo, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-27 08:44:59] dimacus: mekhami:  so you need to start thinking in the point of view "i'm a user that has no access to the machine that has the code, so i'm testing from outside in"
[2015-04-27 08:45:35] mhall_work: But I don't know if the structure of grid tests are different from otherwise
[2015-04-27 08:45:54] dimacus: it's  quite literarly the same mhall_work
[2015-04-27 08:46:03] dimacus: just simple… localhost is evil
[2015-04-27 08:46:14] dimacus: everything is the same… but localhost is the devil
[2015-04-27 08:46:21] mhall_work: Agreed
[2015-04-27 08:46:27] mhall_work: use machine name if nothing else.
[2015-04-27 08:46:45] dimacus: it is much closer to external user… who does not have access to db or etc..
[2015-04-27 08:46:55] mekhami: it's interesting though that
[2015-04-27 08:46:56] dimacus: outside user, looking into your website
[2015-04-27 08:47:00] mekhami: all of the grid docs use localhost
[2015-04-27 08:47:04] mekhami: it'd be nice if that was more clear
[2015-04-27 08:47:16] mhall_work: So I would have two constructors, one for grid, that is commented out, and the other for localhost. That way within the project tests are run from localhost, but in CI, you could sed the comments to switch, and then run in grid as configured.
[2015-04-27 08:47:22] dimacus: so grid is a closer representation of what a real human usser sees when looking at your site
[2015-04-27 08:47:37] dimacus: aka, no access to any backend things like databases etc
[2015-04-27 08:48:27] mekhami: so

[2015-04-27 08:52:41] mhall_work: Ping me otherwise

[2015-04-27 08:53:19] mekhami: maybe.
[2015-04-27 08:53:29] mekhami: i'm not running the hub on the same network as my machine right now so that's a complication
[2015-04-27 08:53:31] dimacus: mekhami:  sorry but a 192 sounds wrong
[2015-04-27 08:53:34] mekhami: although it probably would be on the same network later
[2015-04-27 08:53:37] dimacus: it should be a 10.X.X.X
[2015-04-27 08:53:42] dimacus: in theory
[2015-04-27 08:53:53] mekhami: dimacus well, in this case that's copy pasted from my terminal..
[2015-04-27 08:54:07] dimacus: mekhami: can you ping the machine you are runing the tests from, if you are logged into the grid node?
[2015-04-27 08:54:35] dimacus: 192.X.X.X tend to be ip adress of external external not within network
[2015-04-27 08:54:38] mekhami: like my notebook's public ip?
[2015-04-27 08:55:16] mekhami: cause these machines aren't on the same network right now
[2015-04-27 08:55:20] losh, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2015-04-27 08:55:41] dimacus: yeah….. that's a big red flag my friend
[2015-04-27 08:56:31] dimacus: think basic networking… you have machine A on netwrok, and Machine B on the same network. Machine A tries to get machine B and gets a "yes i'm here" vs "no we are not on same network"
[2015-04-27 08:56:32] mekhami: this is all just proof of concept/explatory stuff
[2015-04-27 08:56:39] mekhami: exploratory
[2015-04-27 08:57:05] dimacus: yeah make sure machine A (your test machien) and Machine B (grid node) can talk to each other
[2015-04-27 08:57:14] dimacus: aka same network, vpn, proxy, etc...
[2015-04-27 08:57:23] mekhami: that'll definitely be the case in the 'future'
[2015-04-27 08:57:31] mekhami: when this project actually starts up
[2015-04-27 08:57:37] dimacus: see
[2015-04-27 08:57:45] dimacus: can't let tests run via grid

[2015-04-27 08:57:59] dimacus: unless grid can actually reach the test site on the same network
[2015-04-27 08:58:07] dimacus: that's a must 101
[2015-04-27 08:58:08] mekhami: yeah that makes sense
[2015-04-27 08:58:39] barancev: wow, new htmlunit
[2015-04-27 08:59:04] dimacus: again, think of grid nodes as your laptop, and test node is someone else's laptop that you are tryig to connect to… if you can't make that connection, you can't run tests
[2015-04-27 08:59:10] dimacus: mekhami: ^^
[2015-04-27 08:59:46] mekhami: understood
[2015-04-27 08:59:56] mekhami: also can i paste you my first question?
[2015-04-27 08:59:58] mekhami: it's simpler
[2015-04-27 09:00:07] dimacus: sure
[2015-04-27 09:00:08] mekhami: and isn't really a question so much as something i wanted to point out
[2015-04-27 09:00:19] mekhami: The first is about this issue: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/issues/14 it still seems to be a problem as I had to use the solution provided at the bottom to fix my node/hub issue. sircapsalot you remember what i was going through? it turned out to be this. should this solution already be rolled into the standalone server? I'm wondering if I should be trying to bring some light onto this.

[2015-04-27 09:02:38] dimacus: including auto reboot windows nodes every 10 tests which alone fixes 90% of all problems

[2015-04-27 09:06:37] mekhami: does this by chance also manage the display issues?

[2015-04-27 09:07:53] mekhami: yeah  that's the problem i had

[2015-04-27 09:23:29] eindoofus: is there a way to get a key/value from an http response using selenium 2? not sure if the answers i'm coming across are outdated. need to get the token being used that's stored in there and there doesn't appear to be a simple way of doing so, which is strange.
[2015-04-27 09:24:12] dimacus: eindoofus: what http response key/values are you looking for? bc if i think what you are thinking… be careful :-P
[2015-04-27 09:24:49] mhall_work: eindoofus, check out RESTassured.
[2015-04-27 09:24:59] mhall_work: Might be able to wrap that into your test stack
[2015-04-27 09:24:59] eindoofus: dimacus, the dev are putting the token into the header using a custom key.

[2015-04-27 09:27:51] eindoofus: dimacus, thanks. will look into it. suprised that selenium doesn't provide something for this already
[2015-04-27 09:27:58] WhereIsMySpoon: eindoofus: it specifically doesnt
[2015-04-27 09:28:12] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium is for interacting with the ui not for inspecting http responses

[2015-04-27 09:29:23] jimevans: proxies are specifically designed to inspect and/or modify http traffic from a browser to a webserver and vice versa.
[2015-04-27 09:29:44] jimevans: expecting selenium/webdriver to supply that feature is expecting it to supply a proxy

[2015-04-27 10:14:25] jimevans: eindoofus: the important thing is using a controllable proxy. and frankly, it's not a common thing. most people *really* don't need it, contrary to what a small vocal minority would have you believe.
[2015-04-27 10:15:46] eindoofus: jimevans, or maybe the majority don't understand it's usefulness. either way, is BrowserMob Proxy the most common?

[2015-04-27 10:16:29] jimevans: eindoofus: i strongly disagree with your assessment. but i'd suspect the browsermob proxy is likely the most common currently, at least for java/python/ruby developers.
[2015-04-27 10:16:44] jimevans: .net developers can use fiddlercore.
[2015-04-27 10:17:01] jimevans: though that's not open-source.

[2015-04-27 10:19:12] eindoofus: jimevans, our sites based around tapping into an api and after logging in it returns a token in the http response header. is this an unheard of method? i'm trusting the devs but if this isn't a good method then what is the alternative?
[2015-04-27 10:19:17] mekhami: what is browsermob proxy used for?
[2015-04-27 10:19:35] Hestil, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-04-27 10:19:44] eindoofus: jimevans, given that our front-end uses an api
[2015-04-27 10:20:12] eindoofus: without that token i can compare against the backend
[2015-04-27 10:20:17] eindoofus: can't*
[2015-04-27 10:20:43] jimevans: mekhami: it's a proxy server. it sits in between the browser and the web server. it can examine, capture, and modify the raw http traffic.
[2015-04-27 10:21:10] jimevans: mekhami: it also has an API, and thus the captured data can be examined programmatically
[2015-04-27 10:21:31] mekhami: what's the use case for that kind of thing? (sorry for the not entirely channel relevant questions, i'm just trying to absorb everything)

[2015-04-27 10:21:57] sircapsalot: jimevans, do you have that second to unlock the wiki for those fixes i had?
[2015-04-27 10:22:02] kyoob: i'd imagine a healthy portion of the populace use whatever http methods their language provides and pass cookie information back and forth between that and the webdriver object if they need to stay logged in or whatever
[2015-04-27 10:22:21] sircapsalot: or rather, ato?  could you unlock that wiki? I have more fixes
[2015-04-27 10:22:23] eindoofus: mekhami, in my case i need to token returned in the http header response after logging in to use for the api. that way i can compare the ui and backend. our front-end taps into an api

[2015-04-27 10:23:16] jimevans: mekhami: if you need to get the status code of a given web page or resource (the call yields a 404 instead of a 200)l; or if you want to modify the incoming HTML to, say, install a javascript error handling script to capture all javascript errors; or any number of other things that you can't get from the browser without diving into their respective developer tools.
[2015-04-27 10:23:21] mekhami: i think historically i would have thought to do that via unittesting the back end.
[2015-04-27 10:23:53] Stevesan, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2015-04-27 10:23:54] jimevans: eindoofus: how does the page in the browser access the token in the header?
[2015-04-27 10:23:56] eindoofus: i belive unittesting only would verify the backend works, not that the ui displays the correct data
[2015-04-27 10:24:56] mekhami: eindoofus i have more experience in django than anything else, and in django i would just look through the response object, but this is my extremely naive attempt at understanding your problem. (And i'm not positing a solution either, just thinking out loud.)
[2015-04-27 10:24:57] eindoofus: jimevans, it uses the token after logging in whenever it makes request to endpoints on the api to retrieve data to populate different web components.
[2015-04-27 10:25:52] eindoofus: mekhami, how would you look at the response object though while your doing ui testing?
[2015-04-27 10:26:19] eindoofus: each user can recieve a unique token when logging in
[2015-04-27 10:26:40] mekhami: eindoofus i guess my point is that the token stuff generally gets handled by the app framework (django) and not ui but that could be totally wrong
[2015-04-27 10:26:45] jimevans: eindoofus: what does "uses the token" mean? how does it "make request to endpoints on the api"? via javascript? if so, how does it retrieve the token from the http response? afaik, not all browsers expose that via a javascript api available in the DOM.
[2015-04-27 10:26:56] mekhami: like i can do csrf testing and cookie testing in unit tests at the application layer
[2015-04-27 10:27:29] jimevans: unless the "front end" that you keep mentioning isn't a straightforward webpage, and is something like a chrome app.
[2015-04-27 10:27:59] eindoofus: jimevans, believe it's all https and they do make it available to the dom. i'm going to go check
[2015-04-27 10:28:02] swampdragons, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-04-27 10:34:00] kyoob: if you need a token to check some api endpoints why use selenium at all?
[2015-04-27 10:34:12] eindoofus: jimevans, it stores the token in a cookie after logging in and uses that data when making requests against the api to populate web components like drop downs and so on.
[2015-04-27 10:34:26] kyoob: couldn't you log in with an http post?
[2015-04-27 10:34:27] jimevans: ah. okay, then get the cookie.
[2015-04-27 10:34:29] jimevans: :)
[2015-04-27 10:34:36] eindoofus: kyoob, to compare ui against the backend
[2015-04-27 10:34:42] kyoob: ah
[2015-04-27 10:35:01] jimevans: webdriver *does* give you access to the cookie store.
[2015-04-27 10:35:03] kyoob: yeah then get the cookie out of the http connection and pass it to webdriver
[2015-04-27 10:35:08] kyoob: or vice versa
[2015-04-27 10:35:19] eindoofus: lol. sounds a bit simpler now with that detail
[2015-04-27 10:35:33] jimevans: (standard caveats apply)
[2015-04-27 10:35:58] kyoob: i feel your pain, i just wrestled with this very thing last friday
