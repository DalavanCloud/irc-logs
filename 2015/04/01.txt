[2015-04-01 04:56:38] sircapsalot: ato, you there?
[2015-04-01 04:57:19] ato: sircapsalot: You sent me a content-less ping.
[2015-04-01 04:57:25] ato: sircapsalot: What can I do for you?
[2015-04-01 04:57:36] sircapsalot: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/www.seleniumhq.org/commit/44e6d7ee0550ef5bbe617c13ce9bc1609787a07c
[2015-04-01 04:57:59] sircapsalot: i tried the git merge origin/pr/18 && git commit â€”amend â€”signoff  didn't work as planned.. what did i do wrong?
[2015-04-01 04:58:23] ato: What did you expect to happen?
[2015-04-01 04:58:29] ato: It appears to be signed off.
[2015-04-01 04:58:53] sircapsalot: doesn't it show something like, http://i.imgur.com/8qT9x17.png
[2015-04-01 04:58:55] ato: Also, we don't really do signoffs on website stuff.
[2015-04-01 04:59:03] ato: Just hitting the merge button is fine on this repo
[2015-04-01 04:59:03] ato: .
[2015-04-01 04:59:07] sircapsalot: ok
[2015-04-01 04:59:18] ato: OK, so you expected a non-merge commit?
[2015-04-01 04:59:21] sircapsalot: but there, it shows "the person" and an arrow, and who signed it off
[2015-04-01 05:00:10] ato: Git merges (rather than rebases) by default, and if the branch isn't in a fast-forward state (e.g. it and master hasn't diverged) it will merge.
[2015-04-01 05:00:33] sugaku, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-01 05:00:52] sircapsalot: ahh, so i needed â€”no-ff most likely..?
[2015-04-01 05:01:33] ato: So in this case you'd have to check out the branch locally and rebase it before merging it back to master.
[2015-04-01 05:01:48] ato: No, you'd need --ff-only.
[2015-04-01 05:02:00] sircapsalot: ah, that makes sense...
[2015-04-01 05:02:00] ato: --no-ff creates a merge commit unconditionally.
[2015-04-01 05:02:28] ato: I have git defaults that helps be avoid this by telling git to always rebase no matter what.
[2015-04-01 05:02:41] ato: But for the website repo, hitting the big green button is OK.
[2015-04-01 05:02:59] sircapsalot: perfect.  thanks
[2015-04-01 05:03:20] sircapsalot: i'll have to experiment more in my git playground regarding the signoff stuff
[2015-04-01 05:03:25] ato: Personally I think we should do the same for the main repo, but the bearded one disagrees.

[2015-04-01 05:09:50] sircapsalot: how about the typical workflow ato, do we typically just push to master, or create a new branch, and do a PR on github
[2015-04-01 05:09:57] sircapsalot: (in any repo)
[2015-04-01 05:10:03] sebhoss, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-01 05:10:27] ato: Committers push changes directly to master.  Whether they develop locally on a branch or not varies.
[2015-04-01 05:10:34] sircapsalot: ok
[2015-04-01 05:10:47] ato: Contributors create branches locally and PRs through Github's UI.
[2015-04-01 05:11:10] ato: IMO we should all use PRs and do code review before integration.
[2015-04-01 05:11:17] ato: But the world disagrees with me.
[2015-04-01 05:11:48] sircapsalot: that's the workflow i'm used to

[2015-04-01 05:20:32] WhereIsMySpoon: karan: depends, are you using webdriver, or the IDE
[2015-04-01 05:22:46] karan: I am using webdriver and did small sample to test gmail login test
[2015-04-01 05:23:01] WhereIsMySpoon: karan: you'll want Grid then :)
[2015-04-01 05:23:06] WhereIsMySpoon: and to use RemoteWebDriver
[2015-04-01 05:23:16] WhereIsMySpoon: google is ur friend
[2015-04-01 05:23:57] karan: now how can I host in server and trigger in clients web-browser
[2015-04-01 05:24:12] karan: now can I host in server and trigger in clients web-browser
[2015-04-01 05:24:34] sircapsalot: grid - node
[2015-04-01 05:24:35] WhereIsMySpoon: you will be able to yes
[2015-04-01 05:24:50] WhereIsMySpoon: you have a many to one relationship between nodes and the hub that you will set up
[2015-04-01 05:25:04] WhereIsMySpoon: so you start execution on the hub and it delegates to the nodes
[2015-04-01 05:25:04] sircapsalot: computer: run-test -> grid -> node (runs test in browser)
[2015-04-01 05:25:27] sircapsalot: per WhereIsMySpoon,  google is definitely your friend
[2015-04-01 05:25:32] sircapsalot: karan
[2015-04-01 05:25:56] WhereIsMySpoon: please bear in mind Grid only allows the -possibility- of parallel testing, it does not actually implement it. If you want multiple tests to start at the same time, you'll need to manually fire them off in separate threads
[2015-04-01 05:26:06] WhereIsMySpoon: or use a test runner that manages that for you

[2015-04-01 05:37:02] karan: because I used same kind of OS and browser in different places

[2015-04-01 07:56:56] adac: Is it possible to start the chromedriver on another host ie instead of 127.0.0.1 on 0.0.0.0

[2015-04-01 07:58:03] rnnr: I would like to prevent alien nodes to accidentally register to my hub - I'm considering to add some pre-shared secret to the configs of both node and hub and match it

[2015-04-01 07:58:33] sircapsalot: rnnr  the most obvious option is to put your grid / nodes in an intranet
[2015-04-01 07:58:55] rnnr: so I've found there is RegistrationRequest and GridHubConfiguration
[2015-04-01 07:59:13] sircapsalot: another one, is to change your listening port from default 4444
[2015-04-01 07:59:58] rnnr: sircapsalot, it is, but it happens when we give somebody virtual machine with webdriver node and he/she forgets to change the port or turn it off :)

Then, to run on the CI server we set the property -Dtest.config.selenium.url=<selenium-grid-url> and locally we leave that off, letting the devs run the browser on their machine. Or, if they want to run them all they can point the tests to the grid

[2015-04-01 11:51:58] jimevans: changing the data type of status isn't
[2015-04-01 11:52:16] jimevans: but i realize i'm shouting at the rain
[2015-04-01 11:52:20] jimevans: so i give up.
[2015-04-01 11:53:15] jimevans: it's not impossible. it requires hacks and inelegance. which grates against my sensibilities as a developer.

[2015-04-01 11:53:31] ato: Either you detect which protocol the remote is speaking by some identifier in the response from newSession and switch into whichever compatibility mode you'd need to talk W3C WebDriver protocol.
[2015-04-01 11:53:50] ato: Or you could look at the dict to see if the new element UUID is present, if it is use that, otherwise fall back to look for the "ELEMENT" key.

[2015-04-01 11:54:07] jleyba: barancev, nice
[2015-04-01 11:54:19] jleyba: the java code loves them system properties :-(
[2015-04-01 11:54:27] ato: Similarly for errors you could check the type of "status" and either look the error type up by number or by string.
[2015-04-01 11:54:56] jimevans: ato: not in the .NET bindings. not without a significant refactor.
[2015-04-01 11:55:05] jimevans: that's been my point all along.
[2015-04-01 11:55:11] jleyba: jimevans, For "status", can you introduce a strong type that wraps the underlying value (whether it's number or string)?
[2015-04-01 11:55:24] jleyba: Kind of like SessionId.java? (which I'll admit can be a PITA to work with)
[2015-04-01 11:55:28] jimevans: i have to deserialize, catch the exception when it's the wrong effing dialect, then reparse.

[2015-04-01 11:56:31] lukeis: Deserializer object, change the deserializer after creating a new session if required and then don't care after that? (deserializer being a member of the driver instance?)
[2015-04-01 11:56:33] barancev: jleyba: people use these properties to tune selenium server
[2015-04-01 11:56:44] barancev: because our config files sucks
[2015-04-01 11:56:56] jleyba: barancev, I know. Config in java sucks
[2015-04-01 11:57:04] jimevans: ato: using the features of the json.net library we use, yes. because deserialization into a CLR object is driven by attributes on the CLR (C#) object properties, which are strongly typed.
[2015-04-01 11:57:05] aaronhumerickhou, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-01 11:57:32] ato: jimevans: Okay, that's not dissimilar to how Go does it which is sometimes a problem.
[2015-04-01 11:57:43] ato: jimevans: Can you have two CLR objects with different attributes?
[2015-04-01 11:57:58] jleyba: jimevans, Can you register a custom de/serializer for a type?
[2015-04-01 11:58:50] ato: We're just talking "status", "message", and "stack" here.  So it's not a big struct we're talking about.
[2015-04-01 11:58:51] emperorcezar, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-01 11:59:05] ato: Also I know for a fact Rust is equally nasty dealing with undefined types like this.
[2015-04-01 11:59:20] ato: But if we could detect which deserialiser to use based on some previous communication, like newSession, it might work.
[2015-04-01 11:59:21] jimevans: ato: i could, yes, but that would be "attempt deserialization, catch the exception when it doesn't deserialize properly, and deserialize again", at least during the newSession call.
[2015-04-01 12:00:11] jimevans: jleyba: yeah, but that would require coding the deserializer, which hasn't been done, and is more work.

[2015-04-01 12:00:33] ato: jimevans: Right, because newSession has a "status" field too, which could either be an integer or a string.

[2015-04-01 12:02:00] shawnknight, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-01 12:02:04] ato: jimevans: Wouldn't you have the same problem if the string error had a different name?  If the response from a Selenium remote didn't contain that?
[2015-04-01 12:02:05] lukeis: slightly out of date...
[2015-04-01 12:03:35] jimevans: ato: no, because it's very easy to define behavior for the default serializer for "what to do when a property in the json stream doesn't exist"
[2015-04-01 12:04:41] ato: jimevans: Okay, so with that logic you could have a partial deserialiser for newSession that looks only for the capabilities object and if that contains some unique identifier that says it's a W3C WebDriver remote talking, you could deserialise it again using the string-based error version?
[2015-04-01 12:05:09] ato: As I understand it this is to avoid having to catch and retry.
[2015-04-01 12:06:15] jimevans: could do. but again, i'm just being curmudgeonly
[2015-04-01 12:06:38] jimevans: wanting my life to be easy instead of having to actually hack
[2015-04-01 12:07:07] ato: My point is that we probably didn't consider typed languages so much when we designed this.
[2015-04-01 12:07:22] ato: For me as a driver implementor it makes absolutely no difference what the field is named.
[2015-04-01 12:07:26] jimevans: right. but now lunch.
[2015-04-01 12:08:02] ato: jimevans: If you think it's worth coming up with a new name, I'd encourage you to open a bug on it.
[2015-04-01 12:08:30] jimevans: i'm all alone on this one. editors don't agree it's useful
[2015-04-01 12:08:36] jimevans: so i don't see the point.
[2015-04-01 12:08:50] jleyba: ato, when the spec first adopted string status codes, Simon put them into java as "state"

[2015-04-01 13:18:59] webdriverUser: Hi all, I recently have been working on an automated testing framework using webdriver and browserstack. However, I now need to set up automated tests for APIs. Can someone recommend a good approach to include this into my framework?
[2015-04-01 13:19:00] *jleyba still doesn't understand the need for two sets'
[2015-04-01 13:19:26] barancev: so what's purpose of two sets if we just merge them? :)
[2015-04-01 13:20:02] barancev: ok, a more practical question: what shoud Firefox do if I pass nativeEvents=true as a *desired* capability, and native events can't be loaded?
[2015-04-01 13:20:14] barancev: what shoud Firefox do if I pass nativeEvents=true as a *required* capability, and native events can't be loaded?
[2015-04-01 13:20:15] jleyba: barancev, ignore it
[2015-04-01 13:20:26] jleyba: a) ignore it, b) fail to create the session
[2015-04-01 13:20:53] gabecase_: webdriverUser there are frameworks designed for api automation testing
[2015-04-01 13:21:49] webdriverUser: can you give me some examples? do they plugin to webdriver?
[2015-04-01 13:22:00] gabecase_: whats your stack
[2015-04-01 13:22:07] gabecase_: ruby, java, .net?
[2015-04-01 13:22:09] gabecase_: etc...
[2015-04-01 13:22:20] webdriverUser: .net, webdriver, browserstack
[2015-04-01 13:22:56] jimevans: why do you need api tests to "plugin to webdriver"?
[2015-04-01 13:23:20] barancev: jleyba: a) ignore and silently (?) fallback to synthesized, b) fail to create a session and stop the browser?
[2015-04-01 13:23:20] gabecase_: you can try a library like REST Sharp http://restsharp.org/
[2015-04-01 13:24:01] jleyba: a) think the returned capabilities should have nativeEvents=false
[2015-04-01 13:24:03] jleyba: b) yes
[2015-04-01 13:24:04] webdriverUser: so i was creating a page object pattern style of framework. However, we can have tests that are GUI or API for a certain component. I was trying to figure out a clean way to work that into the automation framework
[2015-04-01 13:24:11] gabecase_: a good rest client library is all yuou need to formulate api requests, your tests can just do asserts against whats returned

[2015-04-01 13:24:40] jleyba: webdriverUser, You don't need a browser for API testing. Just use a HTTP client. You'll have faster and more stable tests
[2015-04-01 13:25:39] gabecase_: this is python but we use opencafe for api test automation https://github.com/stackforge/opencafe
[2015-04-01 13:25:48] webdriverUser: I understand that I don't need a webdriver for the tests. So I guess my issue is that browserstack is recording all of the steps for GUI tests. So we were using it as a way to keep track of test runs. But without a browser, we have no place to record results
[2015-04-01 13:26:29] gabecase_: can use a build machine for that
[2015-04-01 13:26:37] gabecase_: jenkins etc...
[2015-04-01 13:26:44] gabecase_: will run your tests and record the results
[2015-04-01 13:26:48] gabecase_: can even send emails etc...
[2015-04-01 13:27:27] webdriverUser: I guess if you envision an application that contains a bunch of tests, whether GUI or API, we want them logged to the same place for resutls
[2015-04-01 13:27:30] gabecase_: workflow would be: build machine runs a job, job just contains logic to execute your api tests, api tests are ouputted into XUnit format
[2015-04-01 13:27:47] gabecase_: jenkins captures those results and sends notifications and displays them
[2015-04-01 13:28:04] webdriverUser: thats great to know gabecase
[2015-04-01 13:28:25] webdriverUser: we have not added it to jenkins yet, which i think would be wise
[2015-04-01 13:29:48] webdriverUser: but what if this job needed to run GUI and API tests? And what do I do about the fact that we have BrowserStack with its pretty result runs and history. I dont want to force people to go to multiple locations to see the status of the application
[2015-04-01 13:30:07] aik099, quitting. (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzzâ€¦)
[2015-04-01 13:30:11] barancev: f*ck the profile + desired capabilities + required capabilities relations!
[2015-04-01 13:30:19] barancev: pardon my french
[2015-04-01 13:30:21] jleyba: :)
[2015-04-01 13:30:41] aik099, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-01 13:30:56] gabecase_: the problem is browserstack is focused on browser testing
[2015-04-01 13:31:20] AutomatedTester: barancev: if any of the requiredcapabilites can not be met then we dont start the session
[2015-04-01 13:31:32] webdriverUser: gabecase_, exactly, and we have been using it for that, and the company is paying money
[2015-04-01 13:31:43] gabecase_: in theory you could have a browserstack test log into jenkins UI and execute the api tests and assert what the results are
[2015-04-01 13:31:49] gabecase_: its a little weird though
[2015-04-01 13:32:11] AutomatedTester: and then we try to mean the desired and what is left is returned plus whatever the browser decided
[2015-04-01 13:32:18] gabecase_: (because now your testing jenkins as well as your api tests which is overhead you dont want)
[2015-04-01 13:32:49] AutomatedTester: barancev: so native events should be a desired cap to start...
[2015-04-01 13:33:18] barancev: explain this to the users
[2015-04-01 13:34:02] aik099, leaving. (#selenium)
[2015-04-01 13:34:08] barancev: too much freedom
[2015-04-01 13:34:13] webdriverUser: gabecase_. Thanks, how about this approach? I use standard WebRequests, wrapped in application specific classes that have a method called CommentInBrowserStack. With that method, i make textual comments in their UI
[2015-04-01 13:34:32] webdriverUser: It's working out fine I think. But I was wondering if there was a better approach
[2015-04-01 13:35:41] gabecase_: webdriverUser I honestly would split the testing out and just use jenkins or another CI server(bamboo etc...), you can configure it after each build to post the results however you want
[2015-04-01 13:35:48] gabecase_: can make a post build event
[2015-04-01 13:35:57] gabecase_: to upload the results to a dashboard etc...
[2015-04-01 13:36:34] gabecase_: Rest Sharp is thourhgly good, one of the most popular open source C# projects https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp
[2015-04-01 13:36:41] gabecase_: *thoroughly
[2015-04-01 13:36:58] webdriverUser: gabecase_, thanks for the API framework, will def take a look
[2015-04-01 13:37:01] jimevans: webdriverUser: i don't understand. does the browserstack architecture actually execute your webdriver code on the remote VM, or just the browser, which you use RemoteWebDriver to control?
[2015-04-01 13:38:04] AutomatedTester: barancev: it's not going to be that hard to handle
[2015-04-01 13:38:05] jimevans: because if it's the latter, there's no need for your api tests to hit browserstack at all.
[2015-04-01 13:38:44] webdriverUser: jimevans, great question.
[2015-04-01 13:39:01] webdriverUser: jimevans, here is how i create my driver to access BrowserStack
[2015-04-01 13:39:02] webdriverUser: var driver =  new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri("http://hub.browserstack.com:80/wd/hub/"), capability);
[2015-04-01 13:39:23] jimevans: then presumably, you have some machine (a build server?) executing your tests, no?
[2015-04-01 13:39:24] webdriverUser: so i think im using RemoteWebdriver to control?
[2015-04-01 13:39:28] dude-x, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-04-01 13:39:38] AutomatedTester: barancev: it's one of my next parts of the spec to rewrite
[2015-04-01 13:39:59] barancev: ok :)
[2015-04-01 13:40:00] webdriverUser: jimevans, not a build server, we have some vms running scheduled tasks
[2015-04-01 13:40:03] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-01 13:40:08] jimevans: okay, same difference.
[2015-04-01 13:40:11] *barancev is writing more tests'
[2015-04-01 13:40:22] webdriverUser: jimevans, so what are you recommending?
[2015-04-01 13:40:51] jimevans: i'm saying there's no need for integration of api tests with webdriver.
[2015-04-01 13:40:59] jimevans: you have a set of tests.
[2015-04-01 13:41:04] jimevans: some are api, some are UI.
[2015-04-01 13:41:09] jimevans: they're run by some test runner.
[2015-04-01 13:41:18] jimevans: (like nunit, or visual studio, or whatever)
[2015-04-01 13:41:54] jimevans: you can break out the execution however you like, or put them all together.
[2015-04-01 13:42:03] jimevans: so you have consolidated reporting.
[2015-04-01 13:42:43] gabecase_: precisely, all the test results most likely are in XUnit format which is easy to capture and transform
[2015-04-01 13:43:26] jimevans: gabecase_: fyi, that's almost assuredly *not* the case if they're using the mstest/visual studio test runner.
[2015-04-01 13:43:51] jimevans: proprietary formats ftw!
[2015-04-01 13:43:54] gabecase_: NUnit
[2015-04-01 13:43:55] gabecase_: FTW
[2015-04-01 13:44:13] jimevans: that was sarcasm, btw.

[2015-04-01 13:44:33] jimevans: i did
[2015-04-01 13:44:33] gabecase_: lol, MS Test sucks a bag of rocks :(
[2015-04-01 13:44:53] lukeis1: that must be a big strawâ€¦ or tiny rocks
[2015-04-01 13:44:58] lukeis1, changing nick to lukeis.
[2015-04-01 13:45:12] webdriverUser: jimevans, oh sure, but the ask is to be able to know the state of the application by looking at a table of results.
[2015-04-01 13:45:18] sevaseva, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-04-01 13:45:20] webdriverUser: jimevans, Before we were making GUI tests, BrowserStack was the nice table that conveyed the status of the test suite. Now, we need to include API test results in there. Doestn have to be BrowserStack, but it hosts our GUI results
[2015-04-01 13:45:36] gabecase_: Just have a dashboard for both
[2015-04-01 13:45:42] gabecase_: upload results to said dashboard
[2015-04-01 13:45:46] gabecase_: done
[2015-04-01 13:45:48] webdriverUser: gabecase, why dont you like MS Test, it can do everything that NUnit can and it doesnt require 30 min to set up
[2015-04-01 13:46:14] webdriverUser: gabecase, so youre suggesting that BrowserStack should not be the dashboard?
[2015-04-01 13:46:17] jimevans: if NUnit requires 30 minute to set up, You're Doing It Wrong(TM)
[2015-04-01 13:46:31] gabecase_: NUnit had better plugins and community honestly, just more widely used
[2015-04-01 13:46:40] merobertsjr____, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-01 13:46:41] gabecase_: Probably because its a port of JUnit
[2015-04-01 13:47:03] jimevans: s/its/it started out as/
[2015-04-01 13:47:10] jimevans: there. i fixed it for you gabecase_
[2015-04-01 13:47:44] jimevans: it's diverged enough from its original "port" that it's more accurate to say it is its own thing now.
[2015-04-01 13:48:03] gabecase_: webdriverUser My suggestion and others as well is have a centralized location for your test results
[2015-04-01 13:48:36] merobertsjr___, quitting. (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[2015-04-01 13:48:43] barancev: I should say that passing nativeEvents=true as a required capability to FirefoxDriver construction does not cause a failure, it is interpreted as a desired capability
[2015-04-01 13:48:44] webdriverUser: gabecase_, i completely agree with that. So I guess if I understand correctly
[2015-04-01 13:48:49] barancev: well, well
[2015-04-01 13:48:56] gabecase_: API and Browser tests under the hood may be different but they all report results in a very similar way
[2015-04-01 13:49:12] webdriverUser: i will leave the BrowserStack results as is, also capture them in another format, capture API tests in a format and transform?
[2015-04-01 13:49:36] jimevans: barancev: required capabilities aren't really implemented by most browser drivers. they're certainly not implemented by IE
[2015-04-01 13:49:37] webdriverUser: into a single dashboard
[2015-04-01 13:49:52] jleyba: jimevans, barancev only Firefox implements required capabilities
[2015-04-01 13:50:11] barancev: jimevans: because they are useless for anything other than native events
[2015-04-01 13:50:43] gabecase_: webdriverUser I just wouldn't use BrowserStack for this, would be easier to me to have a centralized ashboard for all my applications test results organized by type: Unit tests, API Tests, UI Tests etc...
[2015-04-01 13:50:47] gabecase_: *dashboard
[2015-04-01 13:50:50] gabecase_: but thats just me
[2015-04-01 13:51:05] jimevans: gabecase_: +1
[2015-04-01 13:51:14] barancev: desired/required makes sense for grid
[2015-04-01 13:51:45] webdriverUser: gabecase yea, makes sense. I guess it just sucks because they provide this nice dashboard with test steps, screenshots and results. It means I would need to recreate this on my own
[2015-04-01 13:51:56] webdriverUser: i was figuring why reinvent the wheel
[2015-04-01 13:52:13] barancev: and I see that required caps are not implemented in FirefoxDriver too
[2015-04-01 13:53:05] barancev: is it worth to implement? to deprecate this odd feature? hm//
[2015-04-01 13:53:07] AutomatedTester: barancev: required is useful for anything that you want to make sure that it available
[2015-04-01 13:53:29] *jleyba pulls out his stick to beat the horse'
[2015-04-01 13:53:30] barancev: AutomatedTester: what can be unavailable other than native events?
[2015-04-01 13:53:50] AutomatedTester: barancev: what if you want a specific browser version

[2015-04-01 13:53:58] jleyba: AutomatedTester, then ask for that version
[2015-04-01 13:53:59] AutomatedTester: what if you want touch available
[2015-04-01 13:54:15] jleyba: make all requested capabilities required
[2015-04-01 13:54:20] jleyba: if you don't care, don't ask for something
[2015-04-01 13:54:29] AutomatedTester: jleyba: there you and I agree
[2015-04-01 13:54:36] barancev: AutomatedTester: do you mean grid? or a local FirefoxDriver?
[2015-04-01 13:54:47] AutomatedTester: barancev: doesnt make a difference
[2015-04-01 13:55:22] *jimevans is so indifferent to required/desired capabilities that his indifference has apathy about the discussion.'
[2015-04-01 13:55:30] barancev: for grid desired/required makes difference
[2015-04-01 13:55:47] AutomatedTester: barancev: and for local it makes a difference
[2015-04-01 13:55:48] barancev: for local driver all caps should be required, imho
[2015-04-01 13:55:59] *jleyba thinks jimevans wore himself out on status types earlier'
[2015-04-01 13:56:18] jimevans: jleyba isn't far wrong, but it's not just status types.
[2015-04-01 13:56:30] barancev: "give me a browser that can touch, or can't"
[2015-04-01 13:56:47] jleyba: barancev, why does it matter for grid?
[2015-04-01 13:56:47] barancev: well, ok, let it be
[2015-04-01 13:57:08] AutomatedTester: grid already does things as required iirc
[2015-04-01 13:57:43] barancev: jleyba: I may prefer chrome (because speed), but Firefox is good enought too
[2015-04-01 13:57:59] jleyba: wtf kind of nonsense is that
[2015-04-01 13:58:09] jleyba: pick a browser so you know what results you are getting back
[2015-04-01 13:58:10] barancev: yes :)
[2015-04-01 13:58:11] webdriverUser: thanks to all for your advice jimevans, gabecase_
[2015-04-01 13:58:24] barancev: I vote for All Required

[2015-04-01 15:41:20] ato: I suppose a CSS selector like that to find the element, then clicking it would make sense.
[2015-04-01 15:41:52] ato: But it should be quite easy to build a wrapper like Select (from Java or Python) around it also

[2015-04-01 18:47:43] aaronhumerickhou: Firefox is built into selenium.  Chrome is not, thats why you need chromedriver.
