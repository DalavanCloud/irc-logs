[2015-04-28 08:12:00] WhereIsMySpoon: what the heck is this gemfile.lock even for...it doesnt sound like its -just- a lock file
[2015-04-28 08:12:14] WhereIsMySpoon: it sounds like its the file that is read in deployment mode by the server for running the server
[2015-04-28 08:14:12] dimacus: oh you are not familiar with gemfile.lock files?
[2015-04-28 08:14:19] WhereIsMySpoon: not really

[2015-04-28 08:15:02] WhereIsMySpoon: .lock says to me that its the lock file for the Gemfile to prevent concurrent modification
[2015-04-28 08:15:07] WhereIsMySpoon: like for most .lock files
[2015-04-28 08:15:08] dimacus: no

[2015-04-28 09:32:30] dude-x: and it only cares about one browser
[2015-04-28 09:32:52] dude-x: you can then have a script that will rerun the test suite with different browsers
[2015-04-28 09:33:22] dude-x: or you can use feature of a test runner which lets you run the same test again via a "parameter". Py.test supports parameterized tests

[2015-04-28 09:36:21] mekhami: thanks friends :)
[2015-04-28 09:37:59] mekhami: i think it's curious that this isn't sort of built in to the remote webdriver/grid system
[2015-04-28 09:38:17] mekhami: i figured it'd be obvious that people would want to run their suite against all the browsers in many situations and that would be possible.
[2015-04-28 09:38:27] mekhami: even just passing an array of desired capabilities instead of a single
[2015-04-28 09:38:49] jimevans: mekhami: separation of concerns.
[2015-04-28 09:40:44] dude-x: mekhami: running tests against multiple browsers can be difficult. If you use jQuery on the website, sometimes the structure of the DOM varies slightly.
[2015-04-28 09:40:53] dude-x: how will you write your page objects to handle exceptional cases
[2015-04-28 09:41:09] dude-x: what if you need native events, but some browsers don't support it
[2015-04-28 09:41:10] jimevans: most test execution systems have some way of parameterizing execution of tests, running them repeatedly with different permutations of parameters. why would the selenium project want to try to duplicate that functionality, which would is not one of its core competencies, and likely would be done in a way inferior to what already exists in other projects better suited to that functionality?
[2015-04-28 09:41:53] WhereIsMySpoon: ^^^^^^^^^^ this
[2015-04-28 09:42:06] WhereIsMySpoon: mekhami: when you ask a question like you just did, think what jim just said there and it will probably answer it
[2015-04-28 09:42:27] HenriettaSalt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-28 09:43:02] jimevans: this, incidentally, is the same logic that applies to "why doesn't webdriver allow you to get the status code or headers of the HTTP response sent to the browser?" proxies exist to provide this functionality, and webdriver isn't (and shouldn't) be a proxy. attempting to become one would likely be done in a way inferior to existing projects that already provide that functionality.

[2015-04-28 10:14:12] dude-x: grid is just a browser dispatcher
[2015-04-28 10:15:07] dude-x: and a hub of communication between the nodes
[2015-04-28 10:15:59] kyoob: it's not a great leap to think a browser dispatcher would have a native way to dispatch x, y, and z browsers
[2015-04-28 10:18:23] dude-x: how it would know to send the same messages to all those browsers?
[2015-04-28 10:18:39] mekhami: logically to me it seems like an extension of desiredcapabilities
[2015-04-28 10:18:50] dude-x: how would you handle differences
[2015-04-28 10:18:51] mekhami: i can see why you would separate your webdriver from your testrunner and in that way it makes sense
[2015-04-28 10:18:53] dude-x: of browsers
[2015-04-28 10:19:25] kyoob: strictly speaking i'm not an advocate of this solution
[2015-04-28 10:19:28] mekhami: if your tests hit things specific enough to have differences in the dom, then they would separate those into different DC's
[2015-04-28 10:19:39] mekhami: how often is that a significant problem?
[2015-04-28 10:19:44] kyoob: but you could case out what to send based on the capabilities of the driver
[2015-04-28 10:19:58] dude-x: would require a new api
[2015-04-28 10:20:43] dude-x: distributed systems are hard
[2015-04-28 10:20:51] dude-x: it's best to keep things dumb and simple
[2015-04-28 10:21:00] mekhami: yeah not making an actual recommendation or anything, just expressing what i thought would be the case.

[2015-04-28 13:41:15] kyoob: selenium ide taught me perl
[2015-04-28 13:41:19] kyoob: in a way
[2015-04-28 13:42:07] kyoob: the export libraries are clutch fora a novice
[2015-04-28 13:42:28] barancev: simonstewart leaved the chat because you talk about selenium ide
[2015-04-28 13:42:51] kyoob: ha
[2015-04-28 13:43:35] kyoob: man, record and playback tools get a bad rap
[2015-04-28 13:46:27] jimevans: kyoob: they're useful in some cases, but, like xpath, that utility is far more limited than most people really want to believe.
[2015-04-28 13:46:50] eindoofus: how should i structure Page Objects if i have a lot of javascript strangeness going on? for example i have five dropdowns i need to open/search/select/deselect items from but nothing changes between them other than that css id. would hate to write a custom method for each action with each dropdown.
[2015-04-28 13:47:23] cweng: For some reason dropdowns don't play nice with firefoxdriver after a parallax
[2015-04-28 13:47:37] jimevans: eindoofus: private helper methods that take the element in as an argument?
[2015-04-28 13:47:39] cweng: the whole page shifts when attempting to select the dropdown
[2015-04-28 13:47:56] kyoob: jimevans this is true. i think if someone could build a really super-capable selenium ide type thing, a lot of automation people would be out on the street.
[2015-04-28 13:48:45] jimevans: kyoob: lots of people smarter than me have been trying to create something "really super-capable" for at least the last two decades. i've yet to see it.

[2015-04-28 13:50:45] kyoob_: jimevans well, who would want to work on that project?
[2015-04-28 13:50:52] eindoofus: jimevans, so i would pass the element itself? i was thinking of passing just the css id as a sting and then having a method that concatenates it before grabbing the element within the helper method
[2015-04-28 13:50:57] jimevans: but i've seen enough snake oil salesmen try to say they had it that i'm immediately skeptical

[2015-04-28 13:52:22] jimevans: eindoofus: either way. the point is that you don't write the "custom method for each action with each dropdown". you write the custom method once, and execute the same operations a dropdown
[2015-04-28 13:53:39] jimevans: of course, you haven't said whether you have page objects or page wrappers, but that's probably immaterial to this discussion.
[2015-04-28 13:53:42] eindoofus: jimevans, thanks. makes sense. what have you seen people do in terms of the method argument? are they passing elements or strings around. i don't want to do anything that is too hackish and deviates from good practice
[2015-04-28 13:54:33] eindoofus: jimevans, just Page Objects at this point
[2015-04-28 13:55:11] kyoob: i don't think it matters which way you go as long as you're consistent throughout your project
[2015-04-28 13:56:20] jimevans: eindoofus: so you expose no individual screen elements in your object classes? in other words, on a theoretical login page, you do not have "setUserName", "setPassword", and "clickLogin" methods?
[2015-04-28 13:57:48] *jimevans really should write that blog post about the difference between page objects and page wrappers'
[2015-04-28 13:57:58] eindoofus: jimevans, i'm confused. i do expose those as public methods. i basically implemented the example at the bottom: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects
[2015-04-28 13:59:01] jimevans: that's a bad example imo.
[2015-04-28 13:59:05] jimevans: but whatever.
[2015-04-28 13:59:11] jimevans: it's not that important.
[2015-04-28 13:59:40] eindoofus: uh oh. to what degree is it bad? that's the way i've been kind of going about it
[2015-04-28 13:59:52] eindoofus: been*
[2015-04-28 13:59:53] jimevans: eindoofus: you're doing it the way most people do.
[2015-04-28 14:00:06] jimevans: like i said, don't worry about it. it's not important.
[2015-04-28 14:00:24] eindoofus: please let me know if you ever write that blog. lol :)
[2015-04-28 14:00:28] jimevans: i'm feeling like being a pedant about page objects vs. page wrappers.
[2015-04-28 14:01:04] jimevans: a page wrapper basically includes methods to manipulate each element on the page, and little else.
[2015-04-28 14:01:15] kyoob: as long as you get logged in somehow, right?
[2015-04-28 14:02:13] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-28 14:02:15] jimevans: page *objects* on the other hand, model the services provided by the page. on a login page, the service would be logging into the application. so it would have a "loginAs" method. or a "submitIncorrectCredentials" method.
[2015-04-28 14:02:28] jimevans: *NOT* methods to manipulate each individual element.
[2015-04-28 14:02:58] jimevans: most people implement page wrappers, and (mistakenly, imo) call them "page objects"
[2015-04-28 14:04:42] jimevans: kyoob: logging in through the UI is usually an antipattern for everything except explicitly testing the flow of the login pages themselves.
[2015-04-28 14:05:24] kyoob: i was just going along with the example, is all

[2015-04-28 14:08:57] titusfortner: jimevans: I'm not sure I'm following your pattern. A Page Wrapper has methods to interact with username and password text fields. Are you saying a Page Object is a separate abstracted object to login using the elements defined in the Page Wrapper?

[2015-04-28 14:10:09] jimevans: titusfortner: i'm saying that you use one or the other. internally, a page object might resemble a page wrapper, it just doesn't expose the methods to interact with username and password fields outside itself.
[2015-04-28 14:10:22] jimevans: but no, it's not a separate object.
[2015-04-28 14:10:28] jimevans: or needn't be

[2015-04-28 14:20:14] MonkeysPaw: cweng:  I'm admittedly pretty new to this, but chrome typically runs like a memory hog. I'm inclined to wonder if chrome is just crashing because it's too bloated.
[2015-04-28 14:20:19] MonkeysPaw: ah, never mind then.
[2015-04-28 14:20:41] kyoob: how does it crash?  'chrome not reachable' error?
