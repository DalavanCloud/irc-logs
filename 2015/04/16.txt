If i put it in a test, the problem is, is it opens a window, with a local server with a random port.   The url will always be dynamic.  should I just not test that one?

[2015-04-16 08:21:04] eireland: hi all, selenium in ruby newbie
[2015-04-16 08:23:17] eireland: in need of help clicking on an element on a page in chrome.  It keeps giving me the error Element is not clickable at point (x,y). Other element would receive the click. Tried maximizing the window, tried injecting javascript to offset the mouse click. Neither are working for me right now.
[2015-04-16 08:24:09] eireland: any help with be much appreciated. The problem may lie with my javascript.

[2015-04-16 08:42:16] jimevans: np. it'd also be an easy change to make it *not* wait in those cases. :)
[2015-04-16 08:42:46] AutomatedTester: jimevans: James and Andreas and I are discussing and we think the IE Driver approach is the better one
[2015-04-16 08:42:47] jimevans: incidentally, i'm about to commit a bastardized version of pageLoadStrategy for the IE driver
[2015-04-16 08:43:03] AutomatedTester: o.O
[2015-04-16 08:43:14] jimevans: bastardized in that it doesn't exactly follow the spec.
[2015-04-16 08:43:23] AutomatedTester: it's specified?
[2015-04-16 08:43:28] jimevans: it looks for all frames on the page, not just the "currently focused" one.
[2015-04-16 08:43:35] jimevans: yep.
[2015-04-16 08:43:37] jimevans: sure is.
[2015-04-16 08:44:01] simonstewart: jimevans: from memory, that was one of the page loading strategies
[2015-04-16 08:44:03] jimevans: section 4.1
[2015-04-16 08:44:07] AutomatedTester: it's extremely underspecified is what I was saying :D
[2015-04-16 08:44:08] jimevans: err, 4.2
[2015-04-16 08:45:06] jimevans: i think it's specified with a simple definition now.
[2015-04-16 08:45:10] AutomatedTester: yes
[2015-04-16 08:45:14] jimevans: and i'm not sure it's underspecified.
[2015-04-16 08:45:29] jimevans: maybe we haven't discussed it as much as we should, but there it is
[2015-04-16 08:45:51] eireland: WhereIsMySpoon and selbot2:https://gist.github.com/eireland/5892c5ce7603979cd267

[2015-04-16 08:46:24] sircapsalot: eireland, don't worry about spelling out selbot2.. save yourself a couple keystrokes :)  selbot2 is a bot
[2015-04-16 08:46:27] lukeis: eireland: you need to use ruby interpolation…. so  do this instead: driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0,#{+graph_button_offset});")
[2015-04-16 08:46:28] WhereIsMySpoon: eireland: selbot2 is a bot :p
[2015-04-16 08:46:42] jimevans: AutomatedTester, simonstewart: maybe we haven't come to a full consensus on that part of the spec, but it's specified well enough to be implemented.
[2015-04-16 08:46:44] lukeis: eireland: oops, left a + in there by accident
[2015-04-16 08:47:08] eireland: WhereIsMySpoon:  Told you I was a newbie : )
[2015-04-16 08:47:31] lukeis: :seen selbot2
[2015-04-16 08:47:32] AutomatedTester: jimevans: there is disconnect between our spec and the html spec and there are a few parts that need definitions
[2015-04-16 08:47:42] sircapsalot: we don't blame you - that's just ignorance towards the Selenium IRC, can't blame you for that ;)
[2015-04-16 08:48:03] Titus___: eirland: you might also try graph_button.location_once_scrolled_into_view
[2015-04-16 08:49:47] Titus___: That takes you to the location of the element as well as returning that location
[2015-04-16 08:50:05] Titus___: you might not need the execute_script
[2015-04-16 08:50:24] WhereIsMySpoon: eireland: you dont need to scroll yourself

[2015-04-16 08:52:39] WhereIsMySpoon: eireland: and did you check that the locator you have works in chrome's dev tools console?
[2015-04-16 08:53:22] WhereIsMySpoon: eireland: also http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp has some docs on ruby usage of waits, click the "ruby" button and unclick "java"
[2015-04-16 08:53:26] jimevans: AutomatedTester: for creating pull requests to the spec, we make our changes to the numbered section files, right?
[2015-04-16 08:53:32] eireland: WhereIsMySpoon: From what I have googled, I can maximized the window, or I offset where I click in Chrome.
[2015-04-16 08:53:36] AutomatedTester: jimevans: yes
[2015-04-16 08:53:41] jimevans: awesome.
[2015-04-16 08:53:50] WhereIsMySpoon: eireland: i test exclusively in chrome atm and ive never ever needed to scroll to click
[2015-04-16 08:53:53] eireland: WhereIsMySpoon: Unless there is another way?
[2015-04-16 08:54:05] WhereIsMySpoon: eireland: scrolling to the element to click on it is baked into webdriver
[2015-04-16 08:54:19] WhereIsMySpoon: calling .click implicitly calls an internal method to scroll into view

[2015-04-16 08:59:38] eireland: WhereIsMySpoon: Is there a way to check the locator for chrome. I have dev tools open and can search for the element. Is there a backwards way where I type in the xpath and it shows me which elements is finding?
[2015-04-16 08:59:53] Titus___: WhereIsMySpoon: there are times where the default doesn't work, and Element#location_once_scrolled_into_view worked. Shouldn't be an issue in this case
[2015-04-16 08:59:53] Titus___: eireland: Waiting for driver.execute_script(*) doesn't make sense
[2015-04-16 09:00:11] Titus___: eireland: driver.find_elements(:xpath=> "//canvas[@alt='Graph']") will give you an array of matching elements

[2015-04-16 10:22:38] AutomatedTester: lukeis: really? is this a new feature
[2015-04-16 10:22:44] lukeis: new?
[2015-04-16 10:22:49] lukeis: been around for quite a while

[2015-04-16 10:26:32] lukeis: set your "Watching" settings per repo
[2015-04-16 10:26:45] AutomatedTester: lol... I dont have time to sort that
[2015-04-16 10:26:58] lukeis:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-04-16 10:27:05] AutomatedTester: when Github auto watched I got put on every single Mozilla repo
[2015-04-16 10:27:14] lukeis: https://github.com/watching
[2015-04-16 10:27:25] lukeis: disable the automatically start watching
[2015-04-16 10:27:32] AutomatedTester: I have done that
[2015-04-16 10:27:36] AutomatedTester: but the damage is done
[2015-04-16 10:27:38] lukeis: click unwatch all on that page ^
[2015-04-16 10:27:48] lukeis: then just start watching what you care about
[2015-04-16 10:27:55] lukeis: like w3c/webdriver ;)
[2015-04-16 10:28:09] *AutomatedTester would spend a weekend sorting that'
[2015-04-16 10:28:14] lukeis: sorting what?
[2015-04-16 10:28:40] AutomatedTester: re adding repos to watch
[2015-04-16 10:28:52] AutomatedTester: since it will remove it from all my repos

[2015-04-16 10:39:03] lukeis: nom nom nom
[2015-04-16 10:41:30] jimevans: so the page load strategy capability in the IE driver will be named "pageLoadStrategy". anyone have problems with this?
[2015-04-16 10:42:05] jimevans: speak now or forever hold your peace
[2015-04-16 10:42:26] lukeis: that match the ones done for FF?
[2015-04-16 10:42:34] jimevans: dunno. too lazy to find out
[2015-04-16 10:42:38] lukeis: :-P
[2015-04-16 10:42:46] lukeis: speaking up that it should match
[2015-04-16 10:42:55] jimevans: and i'm talking about the name of the capability, not the values. :)
[2015-04-16 10:42:58] lukeis: yes
[2015-04-16 10:43:13] lukeis: although the values would ideally be the same too ;)
[2015-04-16 10:43:21] jimevans: i think we discussed earlier that ff is "pageLoadingStrategy"
[2015-04-16 10:43:23] AutomatedTester: it shouldnt pageLoadingStrategy as in Firefox
[2015-04-16 10:43:27] jimevans: and no, they're not gonna match
[2015-04-16 10:43:33] AutomatedTester: it should pageLoadStrategy
[2015-04-16 10:43:50] jimevans: i'm not putting broken values in the IE driver, when the values will be in the spec.
[2015-04-16 10:43:52] lukeis: spec link?

[2015-04-16 10:45:27] lukeis: so…. not defined ;)
[2015-04-16 10:45:31] jimevans: note that the capability name is unspecified. but the values are.
[2015-04-16 10:46:00] AutomatedTester: no one uses pageLoadingStrategy
[2015-04-16 10:46:03] jimevans: which is why i asked the question in the first place.
[2015-04-16 10:46:16] lukeis: no one uses anything except Selenium's FirefoxDriver!
[2015-04-16 10:46:30] AutomatedTester: no one uses the version in FirefoxDriver
[2015-04-16 10:46:38] AutomatedTester: it's not documented
[2015-04-16 10:46:38] lukeis: that's not true
[2015-04-16 10:46:52] AutomatedTester: you use it?
[2015-04-16 10:47:22] lukeis: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriver#-beta--load-fast-preference
[2015-04-16 10:47:27] HenriettaSalt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-16 10:48:38] jimevans: right. and you set the firefox driver setting with a profile preference, not a capability value.
[2015-04-16 10:49:13] davehunt, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-04-16 10:49:13] AutomatedTester: and the documented strategy type is not in the spec
[2015-04-16 10:49:18] AutomatedTester: form that beta list
[2015-04-16 10:50:27] barancev: FirefoxDriver supports types documented in the spec, as well as 'unstable' type that is an alias for 'eager'
[2015-04-16 10:50:28] AutomatedTester: so we are in the wonderful world of 3 divergent places yet again
[2015-04-16 10:51:13] jimevans: hmm. maybe someone who knows about this should update the wiki with the correct information.

[2015-04-16 10:52:11] barancev: done
[2015-04-16 10:52:23] barancev: there is no more this section in the wiki page :)
[2015-04-16 10:52:38] kyoob, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-16 10:52:46] lukeis: well, that's not nice
[2015-04-16 10:52:50] jimevans: great. so now it's fully undocumented.
[2015-04-16 10:53:21] lukeis: people do legitimately use this 'feature'
[2015-04-16 10:53:30] barancev: this in no feature
[2015-04-16 10:53:36] *AutomatedTester wishes there was proof of that'
[2015-04-16 10:53:37] barancev: people should use capavilities
[2015-04-16 10:53:52] lukeis: capabilities isn't looked at for this though
[2015-04-16 10:53:54] barancev: capabilities, not preferences

[2015-04-16 10:56:54] lukeis: proof :)
[2015-04-16 10:57:10] AutomatedTester: lukeis: but it's not using the right thing
[2015-04-16 10:57:20] AutomatedTester: so to make it right we need to break them
[2015-04-16 10:57:23] lukeis: what do you mean "right thing"
[2015-04-16 10:57:32] AutomatedTester: that using a pref in firefox profile
[2015-04-16 10:57:37] AutomatedTester: not a capability
[2015-04-16 10:57:40] lukeis: yep… cause that's how it's coded
[2015-04-16 10:57:52] barancev: updated :wiki DesiredCapabilities
[2015-04-16 10:58:03] AutomatedTester: so to make it right, we need to remove the pref and make it a capability
[2015-04-16 10:58:20] lukeis: barancev: care to doublecheck that wiki change ;)
[2015-04-16 10:58:22] AutomatedTester: the pref is webdriver.LOAD.strategy not LOADING
[2015-04-16 10:58:34] AutomatedTester: not shouting, just showing the distinction
[2015-04-16 10:58:45] barancev: lukeis: the code is correct, we use preferences to store capabilities
[2015-04-16 10:58:54] barancev: but there is no need to expose this to public
[2015-04-16 10:58:56] lukeis: ah, ok
[2015-04-16 10:59:26] barancev: AutomatedTester: it is pageLoadingStrategy in the current implementation
[2015-04-16 10:59:43] barancev: so I documented the status quo
[2015-04-16 11:00:08] AutomatedTester: so why did you go from load to loading
[2015-04-16 11:00:14] lukeis: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=pageLoadingStrategy
[2015-04-16 11:00:33] lukeis: you can see there ;)

[2015-04-16 11:02:23] kggr, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-16 11:02:49] AutomatedTester: lukeis: so you're argument for keeping it pageLoadingStrategy is because people use it as a pref, which is not the same name as the capability, and it's essentially private
[2015-04-16 11:03:14] lukeis: no, not used as a pref… it's an already coded capability as barancev pointed out
[2015-04-16 11:03:28] AutomatedTester: which no one uses as a capability
[2015-04-16 11:03:38] AutomatedTester: no one adds it as a capability
[2015-04-16 11:03:38] lukeis: barancev probably does ;)
[2015-04-16 11:03:43] barancev: yes, it is here for more than a year
[2015-04-16 11:03:44] lukeis: you don't know that
[2015-04-16 11:04:18] AutomatedTester: in that case we should stop documenting what we want as the right thing and document things as is
[2015-04-16 11:04:43] jimevans: okay, fine. i'll make it pageLoadingStrategy.
[2015-04-16 11:04:57] lukeis: AutomatedTester: also w3c test have it!!!
[2015-04-16 11:04:58] lukeis: https://github.com/w3c/wpt-tools/blob/2f48f78a4d4949be317b924ffe4bdd6b6ff0cfa3/webdriver/webdriver/capabilities.py#L7
[2015-04-16 11:05:00] jimevans: that's why i asked before i effing committed it.
[2015-04-16 11:05:06] lukeis: jimevans: ^
[2015-04-16 11:05:12] AutomatedTester: which no one runs

[2015-04-16 11:05:33] lukeis: i'm not hearing a good argument to change it to 'Load' instead of 'Loading'
[2015-04-16 11:05:51] lukeis: have to go… meeting :)
[2015-04-16 11:06:09] barancev: actually, it is not hard to add another alias if you prefer pageLoadCapability
[2015-04-16 11:06:10] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i have to agree that there's no evidence for "no one uses the capability"
[2015-04-16 11:06:21] simonstewart, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-16 11:06:28] AutomatedTester: and there is no evidence that people use it
[2015-04-16 11:06:42] jimevans: but absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
[2015-04-16 11:07:22] jimevans: just because we don't know anyone uses it, doesn't mean no one does. plus if someone out there does, they break when we change.
[2015-04-16 11:07:41] *AutomatedTester holds his tongue about breaking changes'
[2015-04-16 11:07:56] jimevans: honestly i don't give a rat's ass
[2015-04-16 11:08:33] jimevans: i'll just shelve this change until someone comes to consensus.
[2015-04-16 11:08:41] jimevans: or not implement it at all.
[2015-04-16 11:10:13] AutomatedTester: pageLoadStrategy is a better fit with the onLoad event which it kinda waits or doesnt wait
[2015-04-16 11:10:56] eireland, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-16 11:11:00] barancev: ok, I'll implement an alias on the browser side, then deprecate the java binding constant and create a new one
[2015-04-16 11:11:09] kyoob: how should i check if an element would receive the click intended for it without executing the click?
[2015-04-16 11:11:11] barancev: let it be pageLoadStrategy
[2015-04-16 11:11:23] kyoob: i want to wait for no other elements to be in the way
[2015-04-16 11:11:33] eireland: WhereIsMySpoon: That was it! found the div in front of it and the click works now.  Thanks!
[2015-04-16 11:13:06] kyoob: yeah, i know what element would be blocking it but how do i say i want to wait for that element to be out of the other element's way without trying to click there and catching the error?
[2015-04-16 11:13:42] kyoob: should i wait for the dimensions of the elements to not overlap?
[2015-04-16 11:13:55] kyoob: or is there a trick i'm missing?

[2015-04-16 11:14:53] jimevans: AutomatedTester: https://github.com/w3c/webdriver/pull/29
[2015-04-16 11:15:14] kyoob: the weird thing is i'm waiting for the element to be displayed before the click and it still gets blocked occasionally
[2015-04-16 11:15:26] dude-x: is it an animation?
[2015-04-16 11:15:29] dude-x: that's blocking it?
[2015-04-16 11:15:50] kyoob: yeah, you click a row and it expans for like 1000ms and then you can see it
[2015-04-16 11:15:56] HenriettaSalt, quitting. (Quit: Zzzzz...)
[2015-04-16 11:16:03] kyoob: and i mean the failures are like 3% of the time

[2015-04-16 12:08:46] eireland: Does anybody know if Selenium injects your test script into the browser and gets interpreted by the browser or downloads an image of the browser into your script to run locally
[2015-04-16 12:10:17] dude-x: eireland: no
[2015-04-16 12:10:39] dude-x: if you use firefox, it will install a client driver that will wait for commands from your script
[2015-04-16 12:11:16] sohlemac_: eireland: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol might be helpful.
[2015-04-16 12:11:46] sircapsalot: :wiki JsonWireProtocol
[2015-04-16 12:11:47] dude-x: the client driver uses native javascript to interact with the site, your test script runs on its own and communicates to firefox via that driver
[2015-04-16 12:12:04] sircapsalot: sohlemac_ - google code doc is outdated now :)
[2015-04-16 12:12:06] dude-x: other browsers work similarly
[2015-04-16 12:12:31] sohlemac_: sircapsalot: My brain knew that, but my bookmarks bar is living in the past :-)

[2015-04-16 12:22:13] dude-x: yeah :/
[2015-04-16 12:22:20] dude-x: i just remembered that after i posted that
[2015-04-16 12:22:57] dude-x: but using any google app will open up Chrome so that's a nice thing to have support for

[2015-04-16 12:51:49] eindoofus: jimevans, thought ui test and functional tests were common terms. am i wrong?
[2015-04-16 12:51:54] eindoofus: tests*
[2015-04-16 12:52:23] jimevans: oh they're common terms, yes. does everyone assign the same meaning to them? hardly.
[2015-04-16 12:53:05] AutomatedTester: UI tests is extremely broad where functional is more focused (in my opinion)
[2015-04-16 12:53:14] jimevans: if you say so.
[2015-04-16 12:53:37] *AutomatedTester puts on his boxing gloves '

[2015-04-16 12:54:03] eindoofus: lol
[2015-04-16 12:54:11] gabecase: Selenium is for sure is more focused on web application functional tests
[2015-04-16 12:54:48] AutomatedTester: jimevans: in the browser world a UI test could include things like reftests, video testing
[2015-04-16 12:54:57] AutomatedTester: well... my understanding that is
[2015-04-16 12:55:35] jimevans: i don't have a proverbial dog in this hunt.
[2015-04-16 12:55:47] eindoofus: so creating a user object and calling the api to see if we receive the correct response that matches the user object would be called what kind of test? and is that typically done in selenium or through the web framework somehow?
[2015-04-16 12:56:13] AutomatedTester: so... anyone know what the symptoms are for an adult getting chicken pox? asking for a friend...
[2015-04-16 12:56:27] jimevans: eindoofus: i absolutely wouldn't do that through webdriver.
[2015-04-16 12:56:29] DarkElement, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2015-04-16 12:56:41] jimevans: i say that not because to put some amorphous label on the type of testing
[2015-04-16 12:56:46] dude-x: AutomatedTester: adults typically get "shingles" not chicken pox, but it is the same virus
[2015-04-16 12:56:48] DarkElement, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-16 12:56:53] jimevans: i say it because launching the browser is expensive and unreliable.
[2015-04-16 12:57:01] jimevans: reduce the number of potential points of failure
[2015-04-16 12:57:06] dude-x: as a kid, i remembered getting red dots on my arms that were itchy
[2015-04-16 12:57:11] jimevans: and use a straight network client.
[2015-04-16 12:57:31] AutomatedTester: dude-x: that's incorrect. Shingles is a dormamnt version of chickenpox that can be activated if the chickenpox enters the body again
[2015-04-16 12:57:48] eindoofus: jimevans, where can it be done in that case? would that be a whole sepearate diy java app?
[2015-04-16 12:58:04] dude-x: AutomatedTester: from what i hear, shingles is very painful
[2015-04-16 12:58:06] AutomatedTester: it sits at the end of the nerve endings and thats why it is extremely senstive to touch
[2015-04-16 12:58:16] AutomatedTester: from what I hear too
[2015-04-16 12:58:22] AutomatedTester: but I have never had chickenpox
[2015-04-16 12:58:31] AutomatedTester: so can't get shingles (yet)
[2015-04-16 12:58:37] dude-x: it usually occurs in adults who haven't had chicken pox
[2015-04-16 12:58:37] eindoofus: jimevans, by network client, would that be some java library?

[2015-04-16 12:59:49] jimevans: eindoofus: in whatever language you're using yes. if the API is served over http, use something like HttpClient from the apache commons project.
[2015-04-16 13:00:14] AnConio: Greetings all, I'm back...to bug you again, sorry.  I think jimevans already answered this question before but I've been reading so much of this stuff on the internet that I am not sure...so pardon the redundancy if so...SlowLoadableComponent
[2015-04-16 13:00:18] jimevans: at least that's what i'd do.
[2015-04-16 13:00:29] *jimevans runs and hides'
[2015-04-16 13:00:49] AnConio: originally was it meant for page components that were ajax loaded after a page had been loaded?
[2015-04-16 13:00:50] AutomatedTester: jimevans: +1 for testing endpoints like that

[2015-04-16 13:02:10] AnConio: all the examples I've found online are using the SlowLoadableComponent on actual pages
[2015-04-16 13:02:22] eindoofus: jimevans, is there some sort of common design pattern for that sort of thing? i would imagine you would need to setup and teardown each test case. also something to drive the test cases. i can picture a need for a framework to exist for this sort of thing.
[2015-04-16 13:02:38] stepheneb, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-16 13:02:57] eindoofus: wow, i just said "sort of" three times. lol
[2015-04-16 13:03:29] kyoob: you can still use junit or testng like you would with a selenium framework, just make your tests assert the results of the http calls
[2015-04-16 13:04:39] eindoofus: thanks. still confused about how to label these sorts of tests when talking to a developer. are they functional tests?
[2015-04-16 13:04:44] SitamJana, quitting. (Quit: SitamJana)
[2015-04-16 13:04:49] gabecase: yes
[2015-04-16 13:04:54] gabecase: so
[2015-04-16 13:05:06] gabecase: you could categorize them as functional or integration tests really
[2015-04-16 13:05:14] gabecase: we call them acceptance tests
[2015-04-16 13:05:26] gabecase: because they do more then smoke tests they do acceptance tests as well
[2015-04-16 13:05:40] gabecase: so it really depends on how in-depth your test-suite goes
[2015-04-16 13:06:54] eindoofus: cool. thanks for the help
[2015-04-16 13:07:33] stepheneb, quitting. (Quit: stepheneb)
[2015-04-16 13:07:35] jimevans: AnConio: so any LoadableComponent is simply designed to give you a wrapper class to know when a page or part of a page is loaded.
[2015-04-16 13:08:19] jimevans: the SlowLoadableComponent flavor allows you to set a timeout and wait for the page or part of a page to be "loaded", where you define what "loaded" means
[2015-04-16 13:08:32] jimevans: it can be the whole page, or just part of one.

[2015-04-16 17:54:33] sevaseva: LeonardC: most of many components of selenium are not thread safe (and there is no plan to fix that). avoid make sure to serialize all operations with selenium if you have to run tests in parallel
[2015-04-16 17:55:31] LeonardC: huh, I didn't think of that. Thank you, are there any examples online?
[2015-04-16 17:59:57] sevaseva: LeonardC: I am sure there are. Examples of what?
[2015-04-16 18:03:01] LeonardC: Examples of serializing selenium operations. I'm doing a search now. But if you know of a really good one it would be helpful.
[2015-04-16 18:04:58] sevaseva: LeonardC: by serializing I simply mean executing operations serially, one after the other, rather than (possibly) concurrently.
[2015-04-16 18:05:29] sevaseva: Doing those kinds of things can be dome in many ways, depends of the language and what your code looks like otherwise
[2015-04-16 18:05:56] sevaseva: you may be able to find some examples that will help you, but without knowing your code I wounldn't be able to help
[2015-04-16 18:10:02] LeonardC: The way its setup right now, I'm using selenium grid and sending one test at a time to a node one 3 virtual machines. Using xunit should ensure that there is no overlap in running the tests and the tests are sent out from different classes.

[2015-04-16 18:16:58] sevaseva: LeonardC: if your tests or selenium commands/sessions *aren't* running in parallel, there might be other (of many) reasons for intermittent failures. (I may not be able to go that deep in discussing your code here - wanted to be explicit about that; also I need to leave soon)
[2015-04-16 18:17:28] sevaseva: there is selenium-users mailing list where you may be able to get help
[2015-04-16 18:18:46] LeonardC: The test pass 100% of the time when they arent run in parallel. No problem having to leave earlier, I appreciate the help!
