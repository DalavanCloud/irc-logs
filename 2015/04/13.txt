[2015-04-13 02:58:54] AutomatedTester: karan: you want selenium to do something when a click happens?
[2015-04-13 02:58:58] AutomatedTester: or?
[2015-04-13 03:00:54] karan: No, if submit button happens by manual, couldn't get control of the browser

[2015-04-13 03:38:24] WhereIsMySpoon: that isnt really a valid use case and selenium isnt designed to handle it usually
[2015-04-13 03:42:47] karan: Infact, I was spent a month for website automation using selenium webdriver with java, now user ask me to do some manual submit (for couple of pages). So I am looking for possiblities
[2015-04-13 03:43:25] WhereIsMySpoon: karan: so what you want is for your automated test to start, then for partway through for a user to manually click on stuff?
[2015-04-13 03:43:28] WhereIsMySpoon: then the test to continue on?
[2015-04-13 03:44:12] karan: yes
[2015-04-13 03:44:17] WhereIsMySpoon: ..why?
[2015-04-13 03:44:26] WhereIsMySpoon: the automated test cant do it?
[2015-04-13 03:50:23] karan: omg, if I can check whether button clicked or not  then I can do it somehow..!!

[2015-04-13 03:52:32] WhereIsMySpoon: theres no point automating a test that still then involves manual input really

[2015-04-13 04:07:55] karan: But I expect      isClicked()   for buttons, atleast upcomming release of Selenium
[2015-04-13 04:12:06] WhereIsMySpoon: karan: and what exactly would that do?
[2015-04-13 04:12:53] WhereIsMySpoon: theres nothing in javascript without some explicit state saving that would be able to tell you if a button has at some point been clicked

[2015-04-13 14:02:15] jimevans: AutomatedTester: so when we last left off, i was remarking that if we don't have a standard json response structure (i.e. a "value" property in every json response object), then we need to be explicit in specifying the structure of the response values in every command in the spec.
[2015-04-13 14:02:45] jimevans: and that no, failed commands do not always return 200, even today.

[2015-04-13 14:06:31] AutomatedTester: jimevans: so the http response != 200 is non-standard
[2015-04-13 14:06:40] admc1, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-04-13 14:06:58] jimevans: for failed commands? it's always been a feature of the wire protocol.
[2015-04-13 14:07:13] AutomatedTester: for commands that dont exist then yes
[2015-04-13 14:07:19] AutomatedTester: but 404 for a findElement?
[2015-04-13 14:07:30] jimevans: for commands that return an error response too.
[2015-04-13 14:08:32] AutomatedTester: jimevans: "The client should interpret a 404 Not Found response from the server as an "Unknown command" response. All other 4xx and 5xx responses from the server that do not define a status field should be interpreted as "Unknown error" responses."
[2015-04-13 14:09:00] AutomatedTester: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#invalid-requests
[2015-04-13 14:09:49] jimevans: we're not talking about the same thing, i don't think. i mean yes, we're both cognizant of the same facts and referencing the same document, but i don't think we're communicating.
[2015-04-13 14:10:19] jimevans: if, say, findElement returned element not found, it would return a non-200 error code (500 to be exact, if memory serves)
[2015-04-13 14:10:37] jimevans: in addition to having the status of the json response be non-zero
[2015-04-13 14:11:14] jimevans: bah. i'm conflating "error" and "status" there when i mean "http response code" and "status field of the json response object"
[2015-04-13 14:11:26] jimevans: sorry for being imprecise.
[2015-04-13 14:11:58] AutomatedTester: it's cool :)
[2015-04-13 14:12:12] AutomatedTester: we can conflate attributes and properties later
[2015-04-13 14:12:13] AutomatedTester: :P
[2015-04-13 14:12:17] jimevans: :P
[2015-04-13 14:15:06] jimevans: but the more salient point is that the structure of the response for successful commands is not enumerated in a global way in the current spec. and that's true whether the command returns an object (like findElement) or a primitive (like getText)
[2015-04-13 14:17:58] jimevans: take getTitle, for instance. the current spec reads "The 'getTitle' command MUST return the contents of the <title> element like it would for document.title." what's not stated is whether the body of the http response should be {"value": "<title of the document>"}, {"title": "<title of the document>"}, or simply "<title of the document>".
[2015-04-13 14:18:27] jimevans: it's implied that the last option would be acceptable, but of course, that breaks all current local-end implementations at present.

[2015-04-13 14:18:52] jimevans: or at least one reading of the spec would imply that the last option would be acceptable
[2015-04-13 14:19:06] AutomatedTester: that seems like it is underspecified
[2015-04-13 14:19:25] AutomatedTester: I would vote for the first value
[2015-04-13 14:19:32] jimevans: as would i
[2015-04-13 14:19:34] AutomatedTester: {"value": "<title of the document>"}
[2015-04-13 14:19:45] jimevans: but i would take it a step further.
[2015-04-13 14:20:14] jimevans: in that *all* commands would return { "value": <whatever the appropriate return value for the command is> }
[2015-04-13 14:20:33] jimevans: but that's explicitly what we pared out at tpac

[2015-04-13 14:25:47] jimevans: i'm thinking the problematic piece for me is step 6 of the processing model in section 2.4. "command response object" is a term that is no longer defined (it used to be, and used to be defined as { "sessionId": <session id>, "status": <status>, "value": <value> }.
[2015-04-13 14:25:52] fermatta, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-04-13 14:25:56] jimevans: obviously the first two properties are redundant.
[2015-04-13 14:26:13] jimevans: for successful commands, anyway
[2015-04-13 14:26:13] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-13 14:26:31] AutomatedTester: jimevans: and they have been dropped
[2015-04-13 14:26:38] jimevans: which is largely what the discussion centered around at tpac.
[2015-04-13 14:26:39] jimevans: right.
[2015-04-13 14:26:42] jimevans: as they should
[2015-04-13 14:27:27] jimevans: but in dropping them, we've not taken the last step and specified what the remaining command response object should look like for successful command executions.
[2015-04-13 14:27:40] jimevans: we have for unsuccessful command executions (errors)
[2015-04-13 14:27:44] jimevans: and that's great.
[2015-04-13 14:28:01] jimevans: but the success case is underspecified at the moment.
[2015-04-13 14:29:56] oida, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-13 14:30:23] AutomatedTester: I believe what we agreed, and you are right that we would need to handle accordingly in each command, is that have "value" as a default but for things like getElementRect we would return  {height: float, width:float, x: float, y: float} instead of {value: {height: float, width:float, x: float, y: float} }
[2015-04-13 14:31:51] jimevans: i prefer the latter of those two options to the former. makes the spec algorithm so much cleaner.
[2015-04-13 14:32:13] jimevans: but i understand i'm in the minority there.
[2015-04-13 14:32:37] AutomatedTester: well... we work on consensus
[2015-04-13 14:34:09] jimevans: let me try some language.

[2015-04-13 21:14:03] ntlight: Hi all guys. Due to project requirements, I am planning to re-write ChromeDriver by myselft in Java.
[2015-04-13 21:14:41] ntlight: Could you suggest me a design document of ChromeDriver or a contact point? Thank you.
[2015-04-13 21:17:57] smccarthy: ntlight: why re-write it ?
[2015-04-13 21:20:15] ntlight: @smccarthy: Before I used selenium to control chrome for page navigation. But, I failed to open a new page whose link is generated by JavaScript when user clicks on the link.
[2015-04-13 21:21:36] ntlight: I want to capture event when user click on a link, with selenium I could not do that. That is the reason I want to control Chrome directly (without Selelinum). ChromeDriver is good starting point to investigate.
[2015-04-13 21:23:22] smccarthy: ntlight: oh k... https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chromedriver-users might help ?
