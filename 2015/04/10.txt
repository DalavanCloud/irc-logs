[2015-04-10 02:39:40] tester: In page object model, it is suggested not to use assertions in pages, instead use assertions in tests, what is the reason behind it?
[2015-04-10 02:40:10] Dave_B_: I'd imagine because assertions are, well, tests.
[2015-04-10 02:40:15] Dave_B_: could be wrong
[2015-04-10 02:41:31] Dave_B_: the POM is just a suggestion, you can decide for yourself anyway (e.g. my POM doesn't return other page objects after button clicks)
[2015-04-10 02:41:51] Dave_B_: the reason I personally keep my assertions in my tests is that way it's clear what the test is actually doing
[2015-04-10 02:42:00] Dave_B_: so model changes and test changes are separate
[2015-04-10 02:42:22] Dave_B_: if I want to change exactly what a test verifies only that test needs editing
[2015-04-10 02:42:43] tester: ok got your point
[2015-04-10 02:44:51] tester: thanks dave

[2015-04-10 03:00:45] WhereIsMySpoon: webdriver is at least as are the bindings
[2015-04-10 03:01:10] Dave_B_: depending what bindings you use what links you should look up varies
[2015-04-10 03:01:22] Dave_B_: e.g. for python these may be handy for a beginner:
[2015-04-10 03:01:28] Dave_B_: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/py/index.html
[2015-04-10 03:01:28] Dave_B_: http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html
[2015-04-10 03:02:10] Dave_B_: learning about CSS selectors etc will help any which way as uniquely identifying elements in a robust way seems to be something people struggle with to begin with:

[2015-04-10 08:32:47] WhereIsMySpoon: joshin4colours: so if you have a function on a vehicle object for example that would usually be isCar(), you'd make that isCar?() in ruby so that you could go if myVehicle.isCar?

[2015-04-10 08:33:00] joshin4colours: dude-x: WhereIsMySpoon: thanks! I figured that but I'm interested in knowing where that value comes from here
[2015-04-10 08:33:38] WhereIsMySpoon: joshin4colours: in a similar vein there is exclamation mark (!) which denotes that the method will apply a change internally to the object you're calling it on
[2015-04-10 08:33:59] WhereIsMySpoon: presumably a previous script
[2015-04-10 08:34:25] WhereIsMySpoon: or global/system variable

[2015-04-10 08:51:27] Kesl: i have tests written for a web app that's testing chrome and firefox browsers. If I want to use those tests for Android, do I need to rewrite my tests? Currently using Microsoft test explorer
[2015-04-10 08:51:51] Kesl: And do I need to rewrite the framework as well?

[2015-04-10 08:54:37] tonkotsu: could someone tell me how i can run just one test out of my test suite? D:
[2015-04-10 08:55:45] Dave_B_: only way is to delete all the other tests*
[2015-04-10 08:55:49] Dave_B_: *may be lies
[2015-04-10 08:56:47] jimevans: hey, the current firefox driver understands the unexpectedAlertBehavior capability, no?
[2015-04-10 08:58:58] tonkotsu: aha.. D
[2015-04-10 09:00:12] Dave_B_: more seriously tonkotsu without knowing lots more about what test runner you're using I can't answer your question :(
[2015-04-10 09:00:25] gabecase_: yeah tonkotsu what are you using to run tests?
[2015-04-10 09:00:33] gabecase_: JUnit? NUnit? Rspec?
[2015-04-10 09:00:37] tonkotsu: rspec
[2015-04-10 09:01:03] gabecase_: you can just say: rspec 'path/to/your/spec.rb'
[2015-04-10 09:01:11] gabecase_: in your terminal
[2015-04-10 09:01:50] tonkotsu: o ill give that a try thanks
[2015-04-10 09:02:45] tonkotsu: okay that failed horribly D:
[2015-04-10 09:03:07] tonkotsu: load error :|
[2015-04-10 09:03:23] gabecase_: make sure the path to the spec file is correct
[2015-04-10 09:03:34] gabecase_: and that it requires all its depdencies
[2015-04-10 09:04:29] tonkotsu: hmm
[2015-04-10 09:04:38] gabecase_: normally you would have some type of spec_helper/test_helper file with all your dependencies already required in it
[2015-04-10 09:04:50] tonkotsu: so config.rb?
[2015-04-10 09:04:52] gabecase_: then you just require that file
[2015-04-10 09:04:54] tonkotsu: o wait spec_helper

[2015-04-10 11:59:05] jimevans: ericmeds_: you want theory or practice?
[2015-04-10 11:59:14] ericmeds_: either or
[2015-04-10 11:59:24] sircapsalot: mine not good enough?
[2015-04-10 11:59:26] sircapsalot: ;)
[2015-04-10 11:59:40] ericmeds_: how about pratice
[2015-04-10 11:59:42] ericmeds_: practice
[2015-04-10 11:59:49] ericmeds_: guess that matters more :P
[2015-04-10 12:00:18] jimevans: in theory, running headlessly should yield better performance, since the browser doesn't have to render content. in practice, this is rarely so, since most headless solutions actually do the rendering, but just do it in a frame buffer that isn't displayed.
[2015-04-10 12:00:33] jimevans: or at least the perf gain is relatively negligible.
[2015-04-10 12:01:08] jimevans: the biggest argument against headless testing is that no user will ever browse your site using a headless browser.
[2015-04-10 12:01:56] bbarke: ericmeds_: I'd say pros: PhantomJs - use a ton less resources vs a real browser. HTMLUnit - Even less resources. Firefox (using Docker and frame buffer) able to run the tests in the background and still do stuff without it popping up in your way all the time. Plus, if it is in docker you now have the power to place it on other machines, etc.. (hopefully it is out on a grid somewhere though).
[2015-04-10 12:02:15] bbarke: But, as jimevans said, no one will browse to your site with a headless browser
[2015-04-10 12:02:19] ericmeds_: yeah
[2015-04-10 12:02:29] ericmeds_: right now it’s setup as Jenkins being the hub
[2015-04-10 12:02:31] ericmeds_: and a few nodes
[2015-04-10 12:02:35] ericmeds_: that execute the tests
[2015-04-10 12:02:37] jimevans: plus there's no popular headless solution that actually renders using a current rendering engine used by an end-user browser.
[2015-04-10 12:02:53] jimevans: phantomjs uses webkit, but it's an outdated version of webkit.

[2015-04-10 12:03:16] jimevans: htmlunit is a java-only solution, which is a non-starter for many folks.
[2015-04-10 12:03:42] jimevans: plus, it doesn't use an *actual* rendering engine.
[2015-04-10 12:04:10] ericmeds_: the slaves we spin up do not have a gui so decided to go headless for those
[2015-04-10 12:04:20] ericmeds_: they will most likely just be for developers to run on PR
[2015-04-10 12:04:23] bbarke: True, we started off with firefox/IE and then as our tests grew, we needed a way to run them faster without additional resources

[2015-04-10 12:05:07] jimevans: if you care about cross-browser implementations at all, you have to care about windows, and headless solutions are hard to come by on that platform.

[2015-04-10 12:05:18] ericmeds_: right
[2015-04-10 12:05:40] ericmeds_: i always thought firefox/chrome on linux acts the same way ultimately
[2015-04-10 12:05:40] jimevans: and arbitrarily saying "i don't care about IE or Microsoft" is irresponsible
[2015-04-10 12:05:45] ericmeds_: but i guess just better practice on windows right
[2015-04-10 12:05:47] ericmeds_: or mac
[2015-04-10 12:05:55] ericmeds_: since that’s what people are actually using
[2015-04-10 12:05:58] *jimevans is being deliberately provocative and inflammatory'

[2015-04-10 12:07:28] jimevans: i swear, though, i'm tired of people dismissing windows as irrelevant because "it's too haaaaaaaard"
[2015-04-10 12:07:43] jimevans: it happens all too often in open-source projects.
[2015-04-10 12:08:05] ericmeds_: i havent routinely used windows in years

[2015-04-10 12:14:34] mach6: slightly on-topic .. jimevams: thoughts microsoft's future browser "spartan" and building webdriver support for it
[2015-04-10 12:15:40] jimevans: mach6: yes, i have thoughts.
[2015-04-10 12:15:53] mach6: rofl. not sharing? :)
[2015-04-10 12:16:08] jimevans: some of them, i can't share.
[2015-04-10 12:16:25] jimevans: i do know that microsoft is committed to supporting webdriver
[2015-04-10 12:16:28] jimevans: even for spartan
[2015-04-10 12:16:36] joshin4colours: that's good news
[2015-04-10 12:16:48] mach6: well that is good and refreshing news
[2015-04-10 12:17:00] jimevans: but preliminary documentation and releases have been hard to come by, and i'm less than confident.
[2015-04-10 12:17:19] jimevans: i believe they'll deliver *something*
[2015-04-10 12:17:27] jimevans: and that they'll deliver it *eventually*
[2015-04-10 12:17:46] jimevans: will it be available before or at the time windows 10 becomes generally available?
[2015-04-10 12:17:55] jimevans: that, i have little confidence in.
[2015-04-10 12:18:25] mach6: i think that's the general sentiment that a lot of communities following the windows 10 release express

[2015-04-10 12:19:02] jimevans: i think the browser will ship
[2015-04-10 12:19:07] jimevans: with the OS
[2015-04-10 12:19:56] jimevans: but they've been remarkably closed-mouthed about integration points with the browser.

[2015-04-10 12:24:00] mach6: ericmeds_ javascript support is always an issue -- headless and non-headless.. also screenshots, phatomjs can render them, htmlunit can't -- for starters
[2015-04-10 12:24:18] stryx`, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-10 12:24:19] bbarke: well, personally I haven't seen a difference between a headless firefox and non-headless, but when we started converting our tests to use phantomjs or htmlunit, some of them just won't work because they have older and limited javascript engines. So, we have some tests that only run in firefox, and some that are able to run on HTML Unit.
[2015-04-10 12:24:38] bbarke: we tried the tests against HTMLUnit first, then phanotmJs, then resorted back to Firefox

[2015-04-10 12:25:45] brma: newer webkit library
[2015-04-10 12:25:48] mach6: divide and conquer is a safe tact, imo ... run the tests that can be run headless-ly in a headless mode, for the speed improvement.. run the one's that can't elsewhere
[2015-04-10 12:26:01] bbarke: mach6: bingo
[2015-04-10 12:26:36] brma: I've had a good experience so far with running the browsers in the docker containers
[2015-04-10 12:26:52] bbarke: brma: I should try it out. I think we are using 1.8 still

[2015-04-10 12:27:53] bbarke: same, i think docker containers are the way to go
[2015-04-10 12:28:37] mach6: using docker containers is solving the issue a bit differently -- but an effective one ... you are solving the issue with scale vs improving the execution time of each test.
[2015-04-10 12:29:55] brma: I haven't experienced any degradation in execution time due to using containers
[2015-04-10 12:30:30] mach6: I'm not suggesting you will

[2015-04-10 13:32:19] jimevans: in the json response, i don't see a "value" property mentioned anywhere. or is my memory just faulty that i don't remember that change from a f2f?
[2015-04-10 13:32:52] jimevans: or i'm not reading it carefully enough
[2015-04-10 13:33:21] AutomatedTester: jimevans: we changed it at the last f2f

[2015-04-10 13:34:14] AutomatedTester: jimevans: we paired it down in Santa Clara
[2015-04-10 13:36:17] jimevans: yep. here's the relevant bit. http://www.w3.org/2014/10/30-testing-minutes.html#item05
[2015-04-10 13:36:58] jimevans: or part of it anyway
[2015-04-10 13:38:38] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the data model section above has some of it too
[2015-04-10 13:39:58] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the idea was to remove a lot of the superfluous data in what is transmitted back and forth
[2015-04-10 13:40:53] AutomatedTester: so instead of {value: {foo:{}} it would be {foo:{}}

[2015-04-10 13:57:47] jimevans: but since we've killed the generic "value" that we can count on in every response (handy, that was), we need to explicitly specify what each response will look like.

[2015-04-10 14:02:44] trent, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-04-10 14:02:50] jimevans: we still need to define what "someComplex" is for each command then, because I don't see that specified either for those commands that return complex responses..

[2015-04-10 14:09:57] jimevans: i'm guessing the objection is that the response is now pared down to only a single property in the response, so why use the property at all; just return the raw value, since the 200 response guarantees that you don't need to parse the value.
[2015-04-10 14:11:31] jimevans: i suppose one's opinion is predicated on whether one believes that responses should always contain a json object at the root of the response or not.
[2015-04-10 14:14:04] jimevans: but as an implementer on both ends, i'd fall in the camp of wanting an object at the root, and if it only has a single property, so be it. it also allows remote ends to easily augment the responses with extra information if they desire (which local ends are free to ignore).

[2015-04-10 14:18:27] AutomatedTester: the first part
[2015-04-10 14:18:34] AutomatedTester: if it's 200 then we know its good
[2015-04-10 14:18:42] AutomatedTester: at the moment, everything is 200
[2015-04-10 14:18:49] AutomatedTester: so we need a root key
[2015-04-10 14:19:58] jimevans: i'm not entirely sure that's true. at the moment, in the OSS dialect of the wire protocol, every response most certainly *isn't* a 200.
[2015-04-10 14:20:11] jimevans: but i'm probably misunderstanding you
[2015-04-10 14:21:18] AutomatedTester: jimevans: when is a findelement going to not return a 200?

[2015-04-10 14:25:09] jimevans: AutomatedTester: if the element isn't found. the IE driver in particular returns a non-200 response when an element isn't found (in addition to returning status == ENOSUCHELEMENT in the json response body).
[2015-04-10 14:25:35] testerbit: automatedtester: When I click it, the target is: css=#recurring_modal > div.modal-dialog > div.modal-content > div.modal-header > button.close
[2015-04-10 14:26:04] testerbit: how would I use that to see if the class has become "selected"?
[2015-04-10 14:28:13] AutomatedTester: testerbit: if you want the active element you can call driver.switchTo(activeElement)
[2015-04-10 14:28:20] AutomatedTester: or what ever it is in your language
[2015-04-10 14:29:09] testerbit: so I have used this to get the color, how would I get the actual content of the element?: window.document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(window.document.getElementsByClassName('selected')[0]).getPropertyValue('color')
