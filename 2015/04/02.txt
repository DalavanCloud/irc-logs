[2015-04-02 01:11:41] sailors: Hey, I'm dumb and way too terrible to actually read the documentation. How does a Selenium Grid hub/node setup cope with multi-tenancy, if at all?
[2015-04-02 01:13:49] sailors: Is it a case of "no two outside test runners should be using the same hub at the same time, expect failure" or would a hub with a sufficient amount of nodes handle it and queue the tasks/divide up the available nodes?

[2015-04-02 01:26:15] WhereIsMySpoon: sailors: one: grid does not automatically queue up tasks and divide up nodes - it only allows you to be able to do that by providing a hub for nodes to connect to. you need to actually do the task queueing/parallel execution impl
[2015-04-02 01:26:50] SelTest75: can selemium be used for testing .Net based windows app
[2015-04-02 01:26:54] WhereIsMySpoon: sailors: two: i dont think that people are generally using two test runners at once per hub but you may want to check that
[2015-04-02 01:27:04] WhereIsMySpoon: SelTest75: no, selenium is for testing websites

[2015-04-02 01:29:23] sailors: WhereIsMySpoon: That's sort of the conclusion I'm arriving at. Just trying to confirm that if I wanted to have multiple test runners going at the same time, it'd be a bit of a mess and Selenium Hub has nothing to do with enabling that.

Just any details at all would be appreciated, really
[2015-04-02 01:40:34] sailors: At this point my goal is to figure out if A Thing I Have A Slight Inkling Of is even accomplishable
