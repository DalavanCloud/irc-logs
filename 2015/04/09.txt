[2015-04-09 06:45:37] barancev: again to visibility and interactability///
[2015-04-09 06:46:10] barancev: do we want to check layout (like chromedriver does)?
[2015-04-09 06:47:07] barancev: "I can't click this element because it is covered by another element that will accept the click"
[2015-04-09 06:47:39] dude-x: it kind of works like that now
[2015-04-09 06:47:54] barancev: +: yes, a user can't click it too
[2015-04-09 06:48:24] mekhami, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-09 06:48:35] barancev: -: if the element is focusable (e.g. a button or a link) a user can navigate to it with TABs and press space
[2015-04-09 06:48:48] barancev: that is effectively the same as click
[2015-04-09 06:49:14] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: that isnt normal user behaviour though
[2015-04-09 06:49:22] WhereIsMySpoon: the tab thing
[2015-04-09 06:49:45] barancev: think about a blind user :)
[2015-04-09 06:49:53] barancev: selenium has no eyes
[2015-04-09 06:50:51] barancev: does screen readers for blind users check layout?

[2015-04-09 07:00:58] ato: If you can tab to it it's also interactable.
[2015-04-09 07:01:45] WhereIsMySpoon: ah true barancev
[2015-04-09 07:02:07] barancev: so we need also "clickable" that is not equal to "interactable"? shit
[2015-04-09 07:03:20] ato: If you want to counter for “input field visually hidden by another element” scenario.
[2015-04-09 07:03:25] ato: I'm not convinced we want to do that.
[2015-04-09 07:03:37] ato: But again, question for the WG.

[2015-04-09 07:49:14] barancev: in the last 2-3 weeks
[2015-04-09 07:49:40] ato: My refactor landed.
[2015-04-09 07:49:40] jimevans: what. the. hell. :ci
[2015-04-09 07:50:05] barancev: ato: refactor == no functional changes?
[2015-04-09 07:50:41] ato: barancev: Yes, in theory.
[2015-04-09 07:50:46] barancev: ok
[2015-04-09 07:50:50] ato: There are to known regressions I think.
[2015-04-09 07:51:11] barancev: I mean new features
[2015-04-09 07:52:01] ato: No new features landed IIRC.
[2015-04-09 07:52:42] jimevans: builds are completely borked
[2015-04-09 07:53:20] ato: Build is green.
[2015-04-09 07:53:28] ato: Tests are failing though.
[2015-04-09 07:53:41] jimevans: ato: :-P
[2015-04-09 07:53:44] jimevans: you know what i mean.
[2015-04-09 07:53:54] barancev: jobs are failing, not the tests
[2015-04-09 07:54:38] barancev: I see sevaseva run them manually http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Firefox%2024%20Linux%20Native%20Java%20Tests/1999/
[2015-04-09 07:54:53] barancev: so he should be awary of the problem
[2015-04-09 07:55:59] barancev: to check layout or not to check... that is the question...
[2015-04-09 07:56:04] ato: Ah.  I looked at the failing commit and it's just a doc update.

[2015-04-09 10:54:42] ato: Adding the Python test targets makes sense.
[2015-04-09 10:54:56] ato: But from last I looked at it they are a bit ad-hoc and not always maintained.
