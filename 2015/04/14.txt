[2015-04-14 08:24:33] jimevans: no, nothing in the support libraries are covered in the spec.
[2015-04-14 08:24:34] barancev: it is in support
[2015-04-14 08:24:39] WhereIsMySpoon: oh yea
[2015-04-14 08:24:54] WhereIsMySpoon: fair enough
[2015-04-14 08:25:04] barancev: yes, Java binding wants this feature too
[2015-04-14 08:25:26] WhereIsMySpoon: does it/
[2015-04-14 08:25:28] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2015-04-14 08:25:32] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont really see why its useful tbh

[2015-04-14 08:25:55] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2015-04-14 08:25:59] barancev: iiuc
[2015-04-14 08:26:08] WhereIsMySpoon: what about them
[2015-04-14 08:26:17] WhereIsMySpoon: will it make FindBy work with Select?
[2015-04-14 08:26:18] barancev: may be I'm wrong about jimevans intention though
[2015-04-14 08:26:19] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: consider the page object case, where your page wrapper exposes a field of type Select.
[2015-04-14 08:26:39] WhereIsMySpoon: yah
[2015-04-14 08:26:48] WhereIsMySpoon: Select doesnt work with @FindBy
[2015-04-14 08:26:52] jimevans: should you need to do something like "check the isDisplayed() method on the underlying element", you need to have two properties.
[2015-04-14 08:26:55] jimevans: or fields
[2015-04-14 08:27:04] jimevans: one with type Select, the other of type WebElement.

[2015-04-14 08:27:23] WhereIsMySpoon: so i wouldnt have that anyway :P
[2015-04-14 08:27:25] WhereIsMySpoon: but i see
[2015-04-14 08:27:43] jimevans: this does not necessarily imply using the PageFactory to initialize your page objects.
[2015-04-14 08:27:48] WhereIsMySpoon: ah
[2015-04-14 08:27:52] WhereIsMySpoon: ok
[2015-04-14 08:28:33] jimevans: that's only one mechanism that is provided as a convenience. it's not the only way to properly use the page object pattern.
[2015-04-14 08:28:34] simonstewart: I don't know why people don't just hack the code together to make an ElementLocatorFactory that ultimately finds Selects
[2015-04-14 08:28:38] simonstewart: It's Not That Hard
[2015-04-14 08:29:05] lukeis: â„¢
[2015-04-14 08:29:07] jimevans: simonstewart: well, this is .NET, not java.
[2015-04-14 08:29:09] WhereIsMySpoon: simonstewart: i think its more an expectation that since its similar to WebElement that it would just work
[2015-04-14 08:29:19] jimevans: so, y'know, it's different.
[2015-04-14 08:29:19] WhereIsMySpoon: but it doesnt work with pagefactory
[2015-04-14 08:29:25] simonstewart: I'm so tempted to delete the entire support package
[2015-04-14 08:29:31] WhereIsMySpoon: lolnothx
[2015-04-14 08:29:50] WhereIsMySpoon: you crazy?
[2015-04-14 08:29:54] jimevans: simonstewart: i'd very much like to do the same, for the trouble it's caused me in maintenance.

[2015-04-14 08:30:40] jimevans: when i implemented the support library for .NET it was intended to be a "hey, here's how you could implement stuff if you need it" simply an example repository.
[2015-04-14 08:30:40] lukeis: simonstewart: you do know that what you consider "Not That Hard" is quite difficult to othersâ€¦ you happen to operate at a higher level than most ;)

[2015-04-14 08:32:06] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: oh dear
[2015-04-14 08:32:08] WhereIsMySpoon: i feel your pain
[2015-04-14 08:32:15] simonstewart: jimevans, need a hug?
[2015-04-14 08:32:22] WhereIsMySpoon: i used that for almost a year in work experience
[2015-04-14 08:32:27] WhereIsMySpoon: never again pls
[2015-04-14 08:32:34] jimevans: simonstewart: i rarely turn down hugs. :)

[2015-04-14 08:33:14] barancev: as well as the whole pagefactory implementation
[2015-04-14 08:33:38] WhereIsMySpoon: tbh pagefactory is kinda unreliable with element instantiation half the time
[2015-04-14 08:34:00] lukeis: simonstewart: the other day I integrated a changeset across some distant branchesâ€¦ it flat out left a file out of the changelistâ€¦. i missed it and submittedâ€¦ still have no idea how that happened.

I'm using driver.get("about:blank"), then loading using your JS code, and then invoking a location.reload(), but still the page is not displayed, any suggestions on how to force the driver to load the page?
[2015-04-14 09:58:05] lukeis: reload when you're on about:blankâ€¦ will give youâ€¦ wait for itâ€¦ a blank page :)
[2015-04-14 09:58:32] borbam: haha, but even after injecting the HTML code to the DOM?
[2015-04-14 09:58:41] lukeis: yesâ€¦ you haven't changed the url
[2015-04-14 09:58:58] borbam: how can I force to load the new HTML?
[2015-04-14 09:59:01] lukeis: location still will equal about:blank

[2015-04-14 10:01:31] borbam: I don't know a thing about JS, that's what's up :)
[2015-04-14 10:01:49] lukeis: well, you've just described a sure fire way to end up with a blank page
[2015-04-14 10:02:08] lukeis: and the executeScript should be  "document.body.innerHTML = arguments[0]"
[2015-04-14 10:02:08] borbam: I supposed after setting the innerHTML I should reload the DOM
[2015-04-14 10:02:15] lukeis: nope
[2015-04-14 10:02:29] lukeis: the browser will automatically "reload" the dom
[2015-04-14 10:02:54] borbam: specifying body will just set from <body> downwards, right?
[2015-04-14 10:03:19] lukeis: yes

[2015-04-14 10:10:05] borbam: and the browser opens the file just fine, but injecting the code does not -.-
[2015-04-14 10:10:35] lukeis: you likely have something in there that it's failing onâ€¦ you'd have to provide the file for me to help further
[2015-04-14 10:10:54] borbam: it's something about the html
[2015-04-14 10:10:57] lukeis: better suggestion would be to start up a local http server, put the file in it, point the url to that
[2015-04-14 10:11:01] lukeis: indeed it is
[2015-04-14 10:11:05] borbam: it's not very clean, but I'm not the provider

[2015-04-14 13:16:29] kyoob: you either need to find every element that matches that xpath and tell webdriver to click the third element in the array of elements you've found
[2015-04-14 13:16:46] kyoob: or include the index in the xpath itself, to return only the third matching element
[2015-04-14 13:17:16] kyoob: in that sample, with the 's' added, it looks like you'd be doing the former

[2015-04-14 13:21:58] kyoob: DarkElement: you can try moving the index right into the xpath.  if it's done right, that'll only return one element.  you'll want to use find_element again, without the s
[2015-04-14 13:22:25] kyoob: you might also want to sock the results away into an array first and check out what the contents are in debug

[2015-04-14 14:29:57] simonstewart: So you can leave, unchanged, references that no longer make any sense in a mono-repo
[2015-04-14 14:30:18] simonstewart: Right. But there's this point in time where we'll have multiple repos being mashed into one
[2015-04-14 14:30:40] simonstewart: At that point, a reference in one of the original repos to "//some/file" won't resolve any longer
