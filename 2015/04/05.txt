[2015-04-05 05:57:04] cgoldberg: barancev, found the tests:  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/master/py/test/selenium/webdriver
[2015-04-05 05:57:31] cgoldberg: ... it would be a shame to not run them... perhaps I can setup a sepereate CI for python?
[2015-04-05 05:57:32] barancev: cgoldberg: you asted about *unit* tests
[2015-04-05 05:57:39] barancev: *asked
[2015-04-05 05:57:50] cgoldberg: blah.. unit.. acceptance... integration.. they use python's unittest
[2015-04-05 05:58:27] *cgoldberg rephrases'
[2015-04-05 05:58:38] barancev: actually we run them with py.test
[2015-04-05 05:58:52] cgoldberg: barancev, i stand corrected :)  but is that in CI?
[2015-04-05 05:58:53] ato: cgoldberg: We don't run them on the CI.
[2015-04-05 05:59:04] barancev: no, no python tests on CI
[2015-04-05 05:59:49] cgoldberg: what i'm really looking for is to validate supported python versions... so using something like tox or travis to run across all supported python versions
[2015-04-05 06:00:21] barancev: but the browser...
[2015-04-05 06:00:28] ato: barancev: Re. opacity: Probably an overlook.
[2015-04-05 06:00:39] barancev: ato: I don't want to say that ignoring opacity is wrong, it is good if displayed property is interpreted as interactable (not "visible by eyes")

[2015-04-05 06:00:59] barancev: a user can type into a text box with zero opacity
[2015-04-05 06:01:13] barancev: and can click zero opacity buttons
[2015-04-05 06:01:29] ato: That's why we have the interactibility concept.
[2015-04-05 06:01:34] cgoldberg: ato.. are the py tests run at all regularly.. or just ad-hoc?
[2015-04-05 06:01:49] barancev: but it is not properly defined
[2015-04-05 06:01:53] ato: cgoldberg: Ad-hoc is my impression.  Hopefully they're run before a release.
[2015-04-05 06:02:11] barancev: interactable == displayed AND not disabled
[2015-04-05 06:02:27] barancev: if displayed ignores opacity -- it is ok
[2015-04-05 06:02:58] barancev: so I want to be sure opacility will never be added to the spec :)
[2015-04-05 06:03:10] ato: The displayed algorithm is not analogous to interactable elements.
[2015-04-05 06:03:27] barancev: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#interactable-elements
[2015-04-05 06:03:40] ato: There may be an input field hidden behind a div, covering it completely, that is interactable but not visible.
[2015-04-05 06:03:40] barancev: "The element must be displayed"
[2015-04-05 06:04:01] ato: That's wrong.
[2015-04-05 06:04:12] ato: FWIW I'm going to suggest we drop element visibility at some point.
[2015-04-05 06:04:18] barancev: :)
[2015-04-05 06:04:26] cgoldberg: ato, what about running travis for the py tests?  I can set it up,,, that way we can have up to date test runs... and test across python 2.6/2.7/3.2/3.3/3.4
[2015-04-05 06:04:43] barancev: yes, we need interactability much more
[2015-04-05 06:04:58] barancev: cgoldberg: you need to run browser somewhere
[2015-04-05 06:05:00] ato: There are conceptual issues with element displayed that we can't solve.
[2015-04-05 06:05:25] cgoldberg: barancev, you can run a browser on travis-ci... headless with xvfb
[2015-04-05 06:06:12] ato: cgoldberg: I enabled a Java build test on Travis for PRs a few days ago (see my email to selenium-developers@), but we don't run any tests as part of that yet.
[2015-04-05 06:06:49] cgoldberg: and i don't need a matrix of browser versions... just latest Firefox would satisfy me
[2015-04-05 06:06:58] barancev: Selenium tests are heavy
[2015-04-05 06:07:05] cgoldberg: indeed
[2015-04-05 06:07:14] barancev: is it allowed on travis?
[2015-04-05 06:07:26] cgoldberg: barancev, yes.. i run them daily
[2015-04-05 06:07:54] cgoldberg: all i would need to do for integration is add a .travis.yml to the selenium repo
[2015-04-05 06:07:59] ato: cgoldberg: My suggestion would be for you to work on integrating the Python test rules in crazyfun with the normal test hooks.

[2015-04-05 06:08:49] cgoldberg: ato... where does crazyfun run CI?  what kind of system is it?
[2015-04-05 06:09:00] ato: crazyfun is the build system.
[2015-04-05 06:09:23] ato: It has some rules that are run on :ci
[2015-04-05 06:09:39] ato: Targets, sorry.
[2015-04-05 06:09:52] barancev: ato: is "hidden behind" aspect present in the definition of "displayed" at the moment?
[2015-04-05 06:09:55] cgoldberg: gotcha
[2015-04-05 06:10:05] ato: There are so many things that needs to be done to make the Python testing situation good.
[2015-04-05 06:10:24] cgoldberg: ato, barancev.. thanks for the tips.  I'll talk to lukeis and AutomatedTester .... I'd like to help improve python testing
[2015-04-05 06:10:27] ato: barancev: It is.
[2015-04-05 06:11:17] ato: barancev: See step 9.
[2015-04-05 06:11:42] ato: barancev: But it only covers visibility in hierarchical chain.
[2015-04-05 06:12:06] ato: barancev: I.e. not an element placed on top of another than belongs to a different part of the tree.

[2015-04-05 06:14:08] barancev: am I wrong?

[2015-04-05 06:16:28] cgoldberg: ato, have you played with the Navigation Timing API at all?  `driver.get_performance_timing()` would be a really nice addition to webdrivers
[2015-04-05 06:16:35] barancev: so we ignore this aspect, and it is a good thing
[2015-04-05 06:16:57] barancev: because it is impossible to handle "partially covered" concept
[2015-04-05 06:17:20] cgoldberg: ato, i used to do this crazy setup with browsermob proxy to get performance timing... now I get the info right from the browser.. it's sweet
[2015-04-05 06:17:29] barancev: and an element covered by some other element is considered disaplyed?interactable
[2015-04-05 06:17:34] ato: barancev: You're right, there's something fishy here.
[2015-04-05 06:18:11] ato: barancev: I'm not really inclined to look too closely into this because I'm quite sure we're going to have to drop the whole visibility idea altogether.
[2015-04-05 06:18:57] ato: cgoldberg: It can be exposed through JS, so out of WebDriver's scope?
[2015-04-05 06:19:00] barancev: if we ignore this layout aspect, and if we ignore opacity -- the current state of "displayed" fits "interactable" as much as possible
[2015-04-05 06:19:15] barancev: just don't change it! don't add opacity to this algorythm!
[2015-04-05 06:19:28] ato: If anything, we should remove the whole section.
[2015-04-05 06:19:33] cgoldberg: ato, yea, you just inject javascript... is that not something that would be included in a webdriver?
[2015-04-05 06:20:05] cgoldberg: it's just a convenience/utility
[2015-04-05 06:20:25] ato: You said WebDriver, so I assumed you meant the actual drivers.
[2015-04-05 06:20:42] barancev: ato: if we consider "opacity:0" element displayed it has two positive implications
[2015-04-05 06:20:42] ato: It seems like a thing you could wrap in a nice API for the binding, yes.
[2015-04-05 06:21:00] cgoldberg: i was thinking of a method under the bindings
[2015-04-05 06:21:15] ato: We shouldn't expose it on the WebDriver API.
[2015-04-05 06:21:16] barancev: 1) "invisible" file inputs becomes first-class citizens, users can interact with them
[2015-04-05 06:21:19] ato: Since it's a utility.
[2015-04-05 06:21:31] barancev: 2) IE can't calculate opacity propely
[2015-04-05 06:21:42] cgoldberg: ato, could it be in the python bindings?  or does everything always get added across all bindings?
[2015-04-05 06:22:10] ato: barancev: You should be able to interact with a <input type=file style="opacity:0"> because you can tab to it.
[2015-04-05 06:22:30] ato: But it seems the interactability algorithm doesn't really cater for that.
[2015-04-05 06:22:31] barancev: but you can't sendKeys to an invilible element
[2015-04-05 06:22:40] barancev: *invisible
[2015-04-05 06:23:01] ato: Right, if we then drop the whole concept of visibility that sorts it?
[2015-04-05 06:23:06] barancev: yes
[2015-04-05 06:23:12] barancev: interactability instead
[2015-04-05 06:23:13] ato: Because all input elements in a document can be interacted with.  Period.

[2015-04-05 06:23:54] barancev: all? no :)
[2015-04-05 06:24:06] barancev: only "interactable"
[2015-04-05 06:24:14] ato: Unless they're disabled or display: hidden IIRC, so there will have to be some provisions.  But we can make “visibility” as simple as that.
[2015-04-05 06:24:22] barancev: no "displayed:none"
[2015-04-05 06:24:28] barancev: no "visibility:hidden"
[2015-04-05 06:24:30] ato: cgoldberg: I don't understand.
[2015-04-05 06:25:08] barancev: interactability instead of visibility, that's what we need
[2015-04-05 06:25:19] ato: Right, agreed.
[2015-04-05 06:25:19] barancev: who cares about visibility
[2015-04-05 06:25:32] barancev: it's all layout shit
[2015-04-05 06:25:34] cgoldberg: ato, do all the bindings have feature parity?  I am only interested in implementing a utility function in the python bindings.  would that be accepted, or would I have to implement it across all supported bindings
[2015-04-05 06:25:46] barancev: z-index, dimentions, colors et all
[2015-04-05 06:25:54] ato: barancev: It's a mistake to reference the element displayedness algorithm in the interactibility definition.
[2015-04-05 06:26:09] barancev: I agree
[2015-04-05 06:26:40] ato: cgoldberg: You can implement something just for Python; not all idioms make sense in every language.
[2015-04-05 06:27:03] cgoldberg: ato... ok cool.. i'll work on a PR for python bindings to add PerformanceTimings..  we'll see how it goers over.  (I take rejection well)
[2015-04-05 06:27:17] ato: cgoldberg: And there is some precedence that some features, especially support utilities, is just for one language.

[2015-04-05 10:35:30] Shapeshifter: Hi. I'm crawling a site using the HtmlUnit driver. Problem is that the site appears to be served in 2 versions, which have slightly different class names for the elements I'm interested in. I randomly reach one of the two versions on each call. So I have a simple catch(NoSuchElementException) to try looking for the second class name if the first is not found. However, I notice that in that case, the
[2015-04-05 10:35:36] Shapeshifter:  crawl is much, much slower. ...
[2015-04-05 10:35:38] Shapeshifter: ... I.e. if no exception is raised and caught, the whole site is crawled in 2 seconds. If I get the alternate version and the try/catch fires, it takes about 1 second for a single element...
[2015-04-05 10:36:18] Shapeshifter: I assume this is some sort of implicit wait...
[2015-04-05 10:36:21] cryzed: Shapeshifter, is it possible that you try to catch that exception for each element you want to scrape and then use the alternate method?
[2015-04-05 10:37:01] cryzed: If that's the case did you try scraping one element and then setting some boolean "version_a or version_b" and use that variable with if-conditionals later down the line to choose the correct scraping method?
[2015-04-05 10:37:11] Shapeshifter: cryzed: yeah. I'm wondering if I should just temporarily disable the (assumed) implicit wait or go through the trouble of implementing a sort of switch that --- yeah just as you described it.
[2015-04-05 10:37:46] cryzed: If for the alternate version of the site each scraping attempt fails and it has to do twice as much work basically, then that might be the reason for the slow-down
[2015-04-05 10:38:10] Shapeshifter: cryzed: yes it should definitely help
[2015-04-05 10:38:51] cryzed: Try that and see if it is any faster. If you have an implicit wait set for each element it will wait for the element to appear if it's not immediately found -- so there's probably the source of the problem, in combination with catching that exception for each target element
