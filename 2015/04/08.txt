[2015-04-08 09:43:44] sircapsalot: chebyte : yes. you can do that.  no, you don't use selenium for "downloading" it
[2015-04-08 09:43:45] jleyba: just use a normal http client
[2015-04-08 09:44:03] chebyte: the problem is that I first need to login
[2015-04-08 09:44:07] chebyte: and then I can access to pdf
[2015-04-08 09:44:09] sircapsalot: then login, fetch the url, then http.get it, and download it.

[2015-04-08 09:44:24] dude-x: the general rule for downloading with a browser is configure the browser to automatically download without prompting; but still these tests are more liable to be flakey.
[2015-04-08 09:44:28] lukeis: :downloads
[2015-04-08 09:44:38] chebyte: with firefox works ok
[2015-04-08 09:44:48] chebyte: but I want to use pahtnomjs as headless browser
[2015-04-08 09:45:46] lukeis: can you call the javascript method that generates the link and get it before the browser tries to download it? and then use an http client lib

[2015-04-08 09:48:09] chebyte: lukeis: you lost the session
[2015-04-08 09:48:23] chebyte: you need to access with the same browser that you made the login
[2015-04-08 09:48:52] lukeis: sounds like just setitng an http header (such as the Cookies, with a sessionId, that you can pull from the browser)

[2015-04-08 10:06:45] tonkotsu: okay apparently

[2015-04-08 14:25:10] jimevans: AnConio: what are you trying to do?
[2015-04-08 14:26:40] AnConio: he he, not sure exactly...mostly understand
[2015-04-08 14:26:52] jimevans: AnConio: and there are changes coming in the .NET implementation of the PageFactory in the next release that would prompt you to use a new interface, IElementLocator, but knowing what you're trying to do would help.
[2015-04-08 14:26:52] AnConio: to see if it's worthwhile using in my page objects
[2015-04-08 14:27:06] jimevans: do you need special behavior on locating elements?
[2015-04-08 14:27:12] AnConio: understood sir
[2015-04-08 14:27:29] AnConio: I'm having one really tricky element right now...it's a menu
[2015-04-08 14:27:44] AnConio: of all 8 menus this one is tripping up my tests 9/10 times
[2015-04-08 14:27:47] AnConio: not sure why
[2015-04-08 14:28:08] AnConio: basic approach is to hover over the menu, wait for it to expand down, and then click on a subMenu
[2015-04-08 14:28:22] AnConio: my code is working for all other menus pretty well...but not this one
[2015-04-08 14:28:46] jimevans: okay. why do you think changing the element locator factory would help?
[2015-04-08 14:28:55] AnConio: the 1st time it hovers over the menu...and clicks on the actual menu itself...great, that's what I want
[2015-04-08 14:29:35] AnConio: the 2nd time it should also hover over the menu and then click on the 1st subMenu...but that is failing..and it seems to be failing on hovering over the menu...which is what it did correctly the 1st time
[2015-04-08 14:30:09] AnConio: and of course it can't then find the subMenu and that is the error I'm getting....ElementNotVisible exception
[2015-04-08 14:30:44] AnConio: again, this code works for all other menus...and subMenus...but occasionally/rarely it will work
[2015-04-08 14:31:48] AnConio: no, I'm not saying IElementLocatorFactory would solve my problems necessarily...but every time I think ReSharper is telling me that my class/page objects should be inheriting from that Interface...or rather...implementing that interface
[2015-04-08 14:32:32] AnConio: I need/want to better understand IElementLocatorFactory and ISearchContext to be honest
[2015-04-08 14:32:42] jimevans: then ReSharper is being stupid.
[2015-04-08 14:33:02] jimevans: ISearchContext is basically an interface that contains FindElement and FindElements.
[2015-04-08 14:33:20] jimevans: note that both IWebDriver and IWebElement inherit from ISearchContext.
[2015-04-08 14:33:23] jimevans: it's a core interface.
[2015-04-08 14:33:35] AnConio: when I extract a certain type/class to its own "definition"...it automatically appends the : IElementLocator...or something like that
[2015-04-08 14:33:59] AnConio: right, I just read that yesterday...
[2015-04-08 14:34:09] jleyba, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-08 14:34:48] jimevans: so the PageFactory scans a given type (your page object type) for members (properties or fields) marked with FindBy attributes.
[2015-04-08 14:35:05] trent, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-04-08 14:35:16] AnConio: my page objects are still pretty "fixed" and very declarative...but they are also very basic, I'm still just creating them..only one of my POMs has more than a handful of webElements declared in it
[2015-04-08 14:36:25] AnConio: but before I go on and start declaring 30 or 50 diff't elements....using the FindsBy annotation...which seems rather tedious I wanted to know if there was a smarter way of doing this...so I think the ElementLocatorFactory might be it
[2015-04-08 14:36:36] admc, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-04-08 14:36:54] losh, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-08 14:37:06] jimevans: the problem with using PageFactory as the way to populate your page objects is that they must be declared at compile time. full stop.
[2015-04-08 14:37:10] jimevans: that's what attributes do.
[2015-04-08 14:37:21] AnConio: right...
[2015-04-08 14:37:29] jimevans: and because they must be declared at compile time, you can't do any expression parsing with them.
[2015-04-08 14:37:55] jimevans: like, say, have your locators in a text file that you can change without recompiling your code.
[2015-04-08 14:37:58] jimevans: that's fine.
[2015-04-08 14:38:15] AnConio: Jesus Jim...you are full of knowledge...on this topic...you don't have a book out there do ya?
[2015-04-08 14:38:29] AnConio: okay, following you
[2015-04-08 14:39:11] jimevans: but all the IElementLocatorFactory (and its replacement IElementLocator) do is tell the PageFactory how to actually find the element when your code references a property or field marked with the appropriate attribute
[2015-04-08 14:39:13] jimevans: that's all
[2015-04-08 14:39:34] swampdragons, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-08 14:40:17] jimevans: in the default case, that's done with a simple call to FindElement (or FindElements, if you've marked a property or field that has a data type of  IList<IWebElement>).
[2015-04-08 14:40:30] AnConio: meaning I don't have to annotate my fields with "FindsBy" strings?
[2015-04-08 14:41:19] jimevans: if you're using the PageFactory, yeah, you do. but there's nothing to say that you can't have your own mechanism to populate the elements referenced in your page objects.
[2015-04-08 14:41:53] AnConio: I can just declare them as IWebElement or IList<WebElement> but not whether it's found by Name or PartialLinkText or ClassName or anything like that
[2015-04-08 14:41:56] jimevans: i've seen (and created and used) frameworks where the element finding logic is part of the base Page object from which all other pages descend.
[2015-04-08 14:42:20] jimevans: and no page factory is use.
[2015-04-08 14:42:24] jimevans: *used
[2015-04-08 14:42:27] AnConio: true
[2015-04-08 14:42:57] AnConio: that makes sense...but those would only be elements that are common to all pages?
[2015-04-08 14:42:59] jimevans: but yes, if you want to use the PageFactory in the .NET bindings, you're stuck with using the attributes.
[2015-04-08 14:43:14] *lukeis thinks I should talk to jimevans here instead… he might reply to me :-D'
[2015-04-08 14:44:24] jimevans: AnConio: not necessarily. in your base object you'd have a simple protected method that calls down to FindElement
[2015-04-08 14:44:39] AnConio: hands off lukeis...he's all mine! get your own man  =)
[2015-04-08 14:44:40] jimevans: and have your locators in the individual classes.
[2015-04-08 14:44:59] lukeis: AnConio: … um, no… he's mine!
[2015-04-08 14:45:10] jimevans: AnConio: actually, given that lukeis and i actually work together, he's got dibs.
[2015-04-08 14:45:10] AnConio: he he, alright, in theory I understand what you are saying...
[2015-04-08 14:45:31] AnConio: snap snap...circle...snap!
[2015-04-08 14:45:39] lukeis: ;)
[2015-04-08 14:45:55] AnConio: it's all good, this is way above my head
[2015-04-08 14:46:02] gabel, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-04-08 14:46:34] jimevans: AnConio: using the PageFactory is a good way to get started. there may come a time when you outgrow it.
[2015-04-08 14:47:08] AnConio: right...guess I was trying to outgrow it too soon
[2015-04-08 14:49:16] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-08 14:50:37] jimevans: actually, i just made the member detection mechanism pluggable in .NET. in the next release, you could, in theory, now use something other than attributes to populate your page objects, but you'd have to create your own implementation for that.
[2015-04-08 14:50:44] jimevans: i wouldn't recommend that
[2015-04-08 14:50:58] jimevans: it'd be a way fraught with fraughtiness

[2015-04-08 14:54:21] AnConio: so you do think that ReSharper is being dumb in that it's recommending that my POMs implement IElementLocator  ?
[2015-04-08 14:55:01] jimevans: there's absolutely no need for them to do so.
[2015-04-08 14:56:12] jimevans: implementations of IElementLocator are only used by the PageFactory, so that the factory can tell the objects how to find the elements their members represent.
