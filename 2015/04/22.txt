[2015-04-22 05:04:14] alko: jimevans: thanks for the reply, sorry i must have just missed you yesterday, finally took an evening off :)
[2015-04-22 05:05:04] alko: mostly i'm just trying to debug some of the problems i encountered with the grid
[2015-04-22 05:05:31] alko: so rearranging things so that i can easily load it into the debugger
[2015-04-22 05:05:47] alko: i'm only looking at the grid code, and all the rest is easily loaded in via mvn from the:
[2015-04-22 05:07:44] alko:     <dependency>
[2015-04-22 05:07:44] alko:       <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
[2015-04-22 05:07:44] alko:       <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
[2015-04-22 05:07:44] alko:       <version>2.45.0</version>
[2015-04-22 05:07:45] alko:     </dependency>
[2015-04-22 05:07:53] alko: mvn dependency
[2015-04-22 05:08:18] alko: or seems to be at any rate, i got the impression i was able to run the grid and the node successfully from this mvn dependency
[2015-04-22 05:08:32] alko: but i didn't thoroughly test it on a fresh machine :)
[2015-04-22 05:08:35] tuxtoti, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-22 05:09:06] alko: i had a lot of success running a huge selenium grid on my last project, but i hear a lot of people complaining about how hard it is to do so
[2015-04-22 05:10:51] davehunt, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2015-04-22 05:13:51] alko: i was pretty easily able to consistently reproduce hanging behavior when i did some playing around
[2015-04-22 05:15:54] alko: so i wanted to see if i could get in and figure out what was going on
[2015-04-22 05:16:02] alko: but i need to be able to run it in a debugger to do so
[2015-04-22 05:16:39] alko: cuz that's the only way i know how to roll :)
[2015-04-22 05:17:38] alko: i think also we could make it much easier to setup nodes for the various browsers
[2015-04-22 05:17:47] Dave_B_, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-04-22 05:17:52] alko: and add some hooks for managability and stability
[2015-04-22 05:17:56] alko: jmx monitors and such
[2015-04-22 05:18:34] anu_c, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-22 05:18:37] alko: at my former client our selenium grids became integral enough to our development and deployment process that they were mission critical
[2015-04-22 05:18:55] alko: and the ops people wanted to build them into a monitoring process
[2015-04-22 05:19:25] WhereIsMySpoon: alko: I think this is the sort of discussion/long question you'd want to post to the selenium mailing list rather than posting it in lots of series of small posts here in irc
[2015-04-22 05:19:45] alko: we had a "roll-your-own" solution driven by Jenkins that used simple url polling to restart and monitor the machines
[2015-04-22 05:20:11] WhereIsMySpoon: i mean feel free to do it here but you're putting a lot of text here that is just ~information~ without stating a short question/inquiry
[2015-04-22 05:20:20] alko: WhereIsMySpoon: ok no worries, i'm a bit of an outsider i've just used this stuff a lot and some of the guys i know are a bit more on the inside :)
[2015-04-22 05:20:35] WhereIsMySpoon: you might get a better, longer response in a mailing list
[2015-04-22 05:20:55] alko: they told me that i should come here to discuss all of this
[2015-04-22 05:20:59] WhereIsMySpoon: alko: you can always send the mail there then poke the devs here that you have done so
[2015-04-22 05:21:04] WhereIsMySpoon: oh right
[2015-04-22 05:21:05] alko: no one pointed me to the mailing lists :)
[2015-04-22 05:21:14] WhereIsMySpoon: well...most of them wont really be around for another 2-3 hours
[2015-04-22 05:21:25] alko: tnx
[2015-04-22 05:21:30] WhereIsMySpoon: its 8am there at best
[2015-04-22 05:21:34] WhereIsMySpoon: for west coast 4-5am
[2015-04-22 05:21:51] WhereIsMySpoon: though I think most of the US devs are on east
[2015-04-22 05:21:53] alko: i'm american too, i just live in europe :)
[2015-04-22 05:22:01] alko: are most of the devs in the US then?
[2015-04-22 05:22:10] alko: and where do i find the mailing list?
[2015-04-22 05:22:10] WhereIsMySpoon: a lot of them are, jim included
[2015-04-22 05:22:40] alko: i haven't used irc since probably 1993 so this is a bit funny to me i was just told this was the place to come :)
[2015-04-22 05:23:01] sircapsalot: welcome!
[2015-04-22 05:23:25] alko: sorry to spam you i'll take it to the mailing list, google away...
[2015-04-22 05:23:32] alko: ta!
[2015-04-22 05:23:47] WhereIsMySpoon: alko: its less that its spam, its good talk
[2015-04-22 05:23:57] WhereIsMySpoon: its just that you need to condense
[2015-04-22 05:25:20] sircapsalot: and yes, WhereIsMySpoon, I'm on EST.. it's 8:19 her
[2015-04-22 05:29:00] alko: ok fair enought, sorry :)
[2015-04-22 05:29:04] WhereIsMySpoon: alko: please dont take it as that you need to contribute less here, its awesome that you do
[2015-04-22 05:29:18] alko: sircapsalot and you are devs?
[2015-04-22 05:29:21] WhereIsMySpoon: im not
[2015-04-22 05:29:24] WhereIsMySpoon: im just a user :)
[2015-04-22 05:29:53] sircapsalot: i'm not a "core dev", but I do contribute a lot to the selenium project, if that's what you mean.  (i'm in the seleniumhq github team)
[2015-04-22 05:30:16] sircapsalot: mostly though, i regular stackoverflow helping people out with the Selenium tag :)
[2015-04-22 05:32:08] alko: no worries, i have used this stuff quite a lot and am a pretty good java programmer and kind of bored, so don't mind contributing where i can. i had a lot of success with the grid software but so many people tell me they have troubles with it that i thought i'd like to get in there. dimacus said he had a laundry list of stuff he'd like fixed there too, but i couldn't even get it into an IDE
[2015-04-22 05:32:08] alko: to debug until i invested a couple days into rearranging the code so i could. any fixes i make on that level can be reintegrated into the main git repo, but i also like to add some JMX stuff for monitoring so i can see what is going on
[2015-04-22 05:32:50] WhereIsMySpoon: youre going to have a lot of trouble getting any project rearrangements merged
[2015-04-22 05:33:02] WhereIsMySpoon: jim and the rest are very set on it being one monolithic project
[2015-04-22 05:33:48] alko: yup, i'm not even going there. really the stuff i am doing just affects the grid piece of the project, which pulls in most of the code via the single mvn dependency outlined above.
[2015-04-22 05:33:57] WhereIsMySpoon: ok
[2015-04-22 05:34:46] alko: it just makes it much easier for me to work on it, and i can remerge any fixes into the single repo, but i would like to add stuff to make it more enterprise friendly.

[2015-04-22 05:35:29] sircapsalot: do you have a fork on your enterprise github account for it?
[2015-04-22 05:36:01] alko: at the end i just hear so many people saying the grid is impossible to use, and i had a lot of success with it, so i would like to try to make it easier for everyone as our experience was having your own grid was the only way to run a lot of tests fast for CI. maybe sauce and their clones are more perfomant now though
[2015-04-22 05:36:29] sircapsalot: i've had a lot of success with the grid.  it all depends on how you use it
[2015-04-22 05:36:58] sircapsalot: I honestly haven't even had to modify the grid code and publish my own
[2015-04-22 05:37:02] alko: i have a fork yup and i made branches with the breakout i did, but i am now in the process of moving those into multiple repos as it is easier to work with, the branch thing i did was kind of kludge
[2015-04-22 05:37:16] alko: yup, i agree, me too. but you are the first person i've "talked" to who is saying that
[2015-04-22 05:37:34] sircapsalot: the others are bitter, i guess :)
[2015-04-22 05:37:48] alko: we were running lots of tests in real time on multiple browsers for CI and getting great results
[2015-04-22 05:37:52] sircapsalot: I have a setup of one dedicated grid in AWS, with 60 m2.medium nodes in AWS
[2015-04-22 05:38:07] sircapsalot: and a script wrapping it, to check the least priced spot-instances
[2015-04-22 05:38:15] sircapsalot: to take down / fire up the autoscaling
[2015-04-22 05:38:29] alko: when we took our grid up to hundreds of nodes though managing the nodes became a lot more difficult than when it was small :)
[2015-04-22 05:38:30] alko: cool
[2015-04-22 05:39:05] alko: i haven't worked with AWS, but one of the guys i was at the selenium conference with in kiev said they had some code for dynamically firing up resources there for testing on a PAAS level
[2015-04-22 05:39:34] alko: we wanted to do something similar but no one else needed the vm resources we had so we could just leave it up all the time
[2015-04-22 05:40:12] alko: i would like to compare performance on using a cloud provider (aws or otherwise) vs a local grid vs saucelabs or one of their clones
[2015-04-22 05:40:36] alko: my experience is CI has to be REALLY fast or devs won't use it, and when we tried to use sauce it was way too slow, maybe that has changed
[2015-04-22 05:42:11] alko: i setup a box in AWS to use as a nexus server for what i'm working on and will setup Jenkins there to automatically update nexus for me. i broke out the project into very small bits - the hub and the node are just single classes now
[2015-04-22 05:42:12] wdj, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-04-22 05:42:19] alko: and all the servlets they launch are also single classes
[2015-04-22 05:42:36] alko: then all the upstream utility stuff is in a few different repos, but could easily be one

[2015-04-22 05:43:04] epteixeira, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-04-22 05:43:09] alko: you can get the hub or node very quickly from github and then mvn gives you all the rest
[2015-04-22 05:43:47] WhereIsMySpoon: alko: sounds like you know what you're doing :)
[2015-04-22 05:43:50] alko: it also allows you to easily have different versions of the servlets that the hub runs (the hub just basically launches a bunch of servlets, and only a few of them seem to be doing most of the work)
[2015-04-22 05:43:54] WhereIsMySpoon: im also a java dev
[2015-04-22 05:44:29] WhereIsMySpoon: fairly new though, coming up on 2 years in work

[2015-04-22 05:44:50] WhereIsMySpoon: its nice to be both the dev and selenium tester for a website though
[2015-04-22 05:45:12] alko: i switched from c++ to java in 1995 and never looked back, or switched to anything else :) i'm more interested in design patterns and other architectural issues and on agile methodologies than in new programming languages, and java makes me happier than c or c++ ever did
[2015-04-22 05:45:23] alko: saying good by to **&* was the best thing i ever did :P
[2015-04-22 05:45:28] WhereIsMySpoon: haha
[2015-04-22 05:45:36] sircapsalot: yea.  pointers can get ugly
[2015-04-22 05:45:37] WhereIsMySpoon: c++ is interesting
[2015-04-22 05:45:48] WhereIsMySpoon: ive used it for a few projects
[2015-04-22 05:45:52] sircapsalot: i've been getting into Golang which is pretty sweet :)
[2015-04-22 05:45:52] WhereIsMySpoon: i also enjoy using ruby
[2015-04-22 05:45:57] sircapsalot: Java is just such a memory hog
[2015-04-22 05:46:04] sircapsalot: yea man.. ruby is nice
[2015-04-22 05:46:20] alko: i am pretty facile with mvn as well, though i hear people quite hate it for some reason it is fairly well integrated into the IDEs and you can load and debug any project very easily and quickly with it
[2015-04-22 05:46:30] WhereIsMySpoon: mvn is nice
[2015-04-22 05:46:34] WhereIsMySpoon: people will hate anything
[2015-04-22 05:46:36] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2015-04-22 05:47:07] alko: java memory management is a big problem, it is true. most of the work with c++ i've done in the last 20 years was integrating java and c++ code via SOAP
[2015-04-22 05:47:21] alko: i'm glad that people have stopped using that (CORBA too)
[2015-04-22 05:47:28] WhereIsMySpoon: ugh soap
[2015-04-22 05:47:31] alko: RESTful back ends seem to be the way to go
[2015-04-22 05:47:32] WhereIsMySpoon: we learned all about that in uni
[2015-04-22 05:47:38] WhereIsMySpoon: ive never used it once
[2015-04-22 05:47:41] WhereIsMySpoon: and it looked horrible
[2015-04-22 05:47:49] alko: one WSDL for C++ and the other for Java and they didn't work together
[2015-04-22 05:47:56] alko: never really got mature honestly
[2015-04-22 05:48:13] WhereIsMySpoon: im not really a big fan of xml in general
[2015-04-22 05:48:37] alko: i've heard that too :) yaml, json, xml, all fine with me
[2015-04-22 05:48:39] sircapsalot: same.  once you've touched with json, and/or yaml.. it's hard to go back
[2015-04-22 05:48:48] alko: they are mathematically equivalent after all :)
[2015-04-22 05:48:53] WhereIsMySpoon: especially when the xml types become a language all of their own
[2015-04-22 05:49:01] WhereIsMySpoon: like in wsdls
[2015-04-22 05:49:23] alko: allright, so my question is when is json better vs yaml? last place i was both were floating around
[2015-04-22 05:49:25] sircapsalot: they are mathematically equivalent in the end, but some are more efficient to write than others :)
[2015-04-22 05:49:37] alko: sorry to bring up WSDL :D
[2015-04-22 05:49:40] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2015-04-22 05:49:52] WhereIsMySpoon: its not like i have ptsd for wsdls :p
[2015-04-22 05:50:02] WhereIsMySpoon: just sayin
[2015-04-22 05:50:09] WhereIsMySpoon: ive never used yaml
[2015-04-22 05:50:12] WhereIsMySpoon: so i dunno llol
[2015-04-22 05:50:23] sircapsalot: usually you should use json if you are using JavaScript, since you don't have to use any libraries
[2015-04-22 05:50:34] sircapsalot: although, it's extremely subjective :P
[2015-04-22 05:50:40] alko: i really figured out how it all worked, but i am happy to forget it. the four layers of definition for WSDL were way more annoying than the fact that it was written in XML
[2015-04-22 05:51:01] WhereIsMySpoon: *rocks out*
[2015-04-22 05:51:02] alko: i see configs in both languages, i'm fine with that, i'm also fine with making mvn poms in xml :)
[2015-04-22 05:51:07] WhereIsMySpoon: nooooooooon stop, devastating everythiiing
[2015-04-22 05:51:18] WhereIsMySpoon: sorry :p
[2015-04-22 05:51:24] WhereIsMySpoon: mvn poms arent too bad
[2015-04-22 05:51:48] WhereIsMySpoon: i think its more the fact people misuse xml more than anything
[2015-04-22 05:52:05] alko: generally you shouldn't have to touch them too much, they are nice with defining things in the environment like versions
[2015-04-22 05:52:09] alko: fair enough
[2015-04-22 05:52:28] WhereIsMySpoon: alko: and all the dependencies :)
[2015-04-22 05:53:08] epteixeira, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-22 05:53:35] alko: yup, exactly, mvn makes my life much easier (remembering what life was like before it). i'm not exactly sure why people hate it, but if another solution becomes as integrated and mature as mvn i'm happy to switch to it. i'm even getting used to using git instead of svn :)
[2015-04-22 05:53:49] WhereIsMySpoon: alko: gradle is similar
[2015-04-22 05:53:57] WhereIsMySpoon: it pretty much wraps mavne
[2015-04-22 05:53:58] WhereIsMySpoon: maven
[2015-04-22 05:54:04] sircapsalot: i don't think people hate it, i think people have just moved on..  me - i'm still using maven for my java projects
[2015-04-22 05:54:09] alko: ok
[2015-04-22 05:54:18] WhereIsMySpoon: we went back to mvn from gradle for some projects tho
[2015-04-22 05:54:19] sircapsalot: some people even still use ivy
[2015-04-22 05:54:22] alko: is gradle integrated into Eclipse/IntelliJ as well?
[2015-04-22 05:54:29] WhereIsMySpoon: gradle is unecessary for small projects
[2015-04-22 05:54:29] WhereIsMySpoon: yes
[2015-04-22 05:54:30] alko: and ant
[2015-04-22 05:54:33] WhereIsMySpoon: eclipse
[2015-04-22 05:54:36] sircapsalot: ant, yep
[2015-04-22 05:54:37] WhereIsMySpoon: dunno intellij dont use it
[2015-04-22 05:54:46] sircapsalot: yea - intellij supports gradle
[2015-04-22 05:54:51] alko: i'm an eclipse guy myself but i don't want to get flamed :D
[2015-04-22 05:54:57] WhereIsMySpoon: haha i am too but i dont like it
[2015-04-22 05:55:01] WhereIsMySpoon: its so clunky
[2015-04-22 05:55:03] WhereIsMySpoon: and slow
[2015-04-22 05:55:05] sircapsalot: that's ok.. only professionals use intellij
[2015-04-22 05:55:09] WhereIsMySpoon: LOL
[2015-04-22 05:55:10] sircapsalot: xD!! kidding.  :)
[2015-04-22 05:55:13] WhereIsMySpoon: sick burns
[2015-04-22 05:55:28] WhereIsMySpoon: *pours water over alko*
[2015-04-22 05:55:55] WhereIsMySpoon: *...and himself*
[2015-04-22 05:56:20] alko: i used intellij like 10 years ago when it first came out, then eclipse copied all the best features and was free, and then i got used to the eclipse short cuts :)
[2015-04-22 05:56:24] sircapsalot: you should at least consider doing the 30 day trial :)  if you don't like it, go back to eclipse
[2015-04-22 05:56:35] alko: i went to intellij again, and set it to use the eclipse key mappings
[2015-04-22 05:56:53] alko: but the killer for me was the code hot swapping didn't seem to work, and i usually code in the debugger
[2015-04-22 05:57:10] alko: eclipse was way better, intellij i had to keep restarting the app which wasted time
[2015-04-22 05:57:31] alko: in all honesty, i usually kept both running as there were some features in intellij i liked better and some in eclipse
[2015-04-22 05:57:46] alko: such as the smart stepping in intellij - brilliant if i don't need hot swapping :)
[2015-04-22 05:57:54] WhereIsMySpoon: smart stepping?
[2015-04-22 05:58:07] sircapsalot: intellij 14.1 introduced fricking setting breakpoints in decompiled code
[2015-04-22 05:58:56] alko: smart stepping allows you to pick exactly which method call you want to step into when you are debugging instead of having to keep stepping in/out to get to the right one as normal
[2015-04-22 05:59:19] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2015-04-22 05:59:21] alko: pretty handy when there is a lot going on on a single line of code
[2015-04-22 05:59:24] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2015-04-22 05:59:38] alko: ok (guys/girls/both?) i got to go take care of a couple things, have a train to catch tonight unless the german train driver strike leaves me stranded, nice to chat catch up later
[2015-04-22 05:59:40] WhereIsMySpoon: like doThis(blah.getThis(), doop.something(), foo.zed())
[2015-04-22 05:59:57] alko: sounds like we will be chatting a lot as there are few people online in our time zone :P
[2015-04-22 06:00:14] WhereIsMySpoon: im uk :)

[2015-04-22 07:05:45] Dave_B_: so there are a few reasons you might want a remote browser
[2015-04-22 07:06:17] Dave_B_: it gives you the ability to run tests against browsers you don't have locally
[2015-04-22 07:06:47] Dave_B_: it lets you separate the running of the tests from the running of the browsers (mostly relevant for CI stuff)
[2015-04-22 07:07:03] sircapsalot: you still there sohlemac?
[2015-04-22 07:07:21] Dave_B_: it lets you run your tests in parallel (it doesn't *cause* this, but if you can farm out the browser stuff then it gets much easier)

[2015-04-22 07:09:53] mekhami: the webdrivers would run on a server somewhere, not locally

[2015-04-22 07:11:01] mekhami: actually Dave_B_  there's a selenium server itself, you register your remote webdriver to that?
[2015-04-22 07:11:24] mekhami: then anybody registered to the selenium server can just run their tests against that webdriver on that server?

[2015-04-22 07:13:25] Dave_B_: so the way I do it is using a grid - I set up a hub somewhere that any test can ask for a browser, and I set up nodes with whatever browser/os i need and they register with the hub. When a test asks for a new driver instance it gets given a matching node and it sends it's webdriver commands to that node and gets back all the usual responses (the test code itself still runs locally)

[2015-04-22 07:13:50] Dave_B_: (the selenium server stuff does the roles of the hub & the node)
[2015-04-22 07:14:01] mekhami: i really wish i could just see all this in action
[2015-04-22 07:14:30] Dave_B_: yeah it's much easier to show someone than explain in text - it's all pretty simple actually
[2015-04-22 07:14:44] mekhami: i believe it is but the words are getting in the way of my understanding, haha.
[2015-04-22 07:14:49] Dave_B_: (well, the code underneath may well be complex, I didn't write any of it!)
[2015-04-22 07:15:23] Dave_B_: no worries mekhami, it takes a bit of getting used to :)
[2015-04-22 07:15:43] Dave_B_: you can set up a mini-grid all locally to try it out, doing is the best way etc

[2015-04-22 07:19:50] mekhami: so does this flow help out with running tests against many browsers without having to repeat stuff?
[2015-04-22 07:20:20] mekhami: like say i wanted to test against chrome/firefox/safari version whatever, i would want to run my tests against all those without having to repeat a bunch of code?
[2015-04-22 07:20:58] oida, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-22 07:21:52] Dave_B_: yeah normally you'd use the exact same code, what i do is have an environment variable that is read to populate the browserName used in the desired capabilites then i can trigger a gives set of tests with whatever browser used
[2015-04-22 07:22:02] Dave_B_: the test code itself has no browser knowledge
[2015-04-22 07:22:21] mekhami: ah okay cause right now my test code specifies Webdriver.Firefox()
[2015-04-22 07:22:36] mekhami: with my naive first attempts at selenium testing

[2015-04-22 07:27:10] Dave_B_: you could use something like this for now, meaning it's firefox until you decide otherwise:

[2015-04-22 07:28:04] mekhami: i'm just wondering like where the environment variable is, it's on your local? it's on the selenium server?

[2015-04-22 07:28:50] mekhami: Ah, okay.
[2015-04-22 07:28:51] Dave_B_: the remote browser is just offloading the browser stuff, the test code still runs wherever you run it, be that local or a CI server or whatever
[2015-04-22 07:28:52] WhereIsMySpoon: you'd pass in -Pbrowser=firefox
[2015-04-22 07:28:58] WhereIsMySpoon: for a java invocation
[2015-04-22 07:29:30] Dave_B_: most common confusion i see with remote webdriver is people think the whole test goes to the node, rather than just the webdriver commands

[2015-04-22 07:30:44] sircapsalot: WhereIsMySpoon, are you trying to pass variables to the JavaVM?  if so, i'm pretty sure it's -D :)
[2015-04-22 07:30:55] WhereIsMySpoon: oh yea then i set it in the build.gradle :Pp
[2015-04-22 07:30:56] WhereIsMySpoon: :P
[2015-04-22 07:31:03] WhereIsMySpoon: sircapsalot: nope, passing to gradle
[2015-04-22 07:31:15] WhereIsMySpoon: then systemProperty "browser", browser
[2015-04-22 07:31:26] sircapsalot: you said "java" invocation, not gradle, so that's where my confusion came from :)
[2015-04-22 07:31:28] WhereIsMySpoon: could probably skip that part and just do -D i guess but whatever
[2015-04-22 07:31:33] WhereIsMySpoon: i said gradle before that

[2015-04-22 08:00:21] sircapsalot: in theory, it's definitely possible with selenium.  is it recommended?   as WhereIsMySpoon stated, it's not "for" layout testing
[2015-04-22 08:01:04] kyoob: selenium can be combined with existing layout testing tools to get you to the screen and state you need to be in
[2015-04-22 08:01:23] kyoob: a lot of them take a webdriver object as an argument
[2015-04-22 08:02:54] kyoob: my thing is, it takes a human to look at the screenshot diffs and say "yes, this new one is fine, this is the new baseline"
[2015-04-22 08:03:06] kyoob: so why not just have that human take a look in the first place?
[2015-04-22 08:03:30] sircapsalot: one thing you can do, is use selenium to take those pictures - put them in a shared location for manual testers to look at

[2015-04-22 10:25:00] mekhami: when i'm starting up a node on a different machine
[2015-04-22 10:25:20] mekhami: is it -hub http://ip.address:4444/grid/register
[2015-04-22 10:25:35] mekhami: basically do i just point it at the hubs ip adress/port
[2015-04-22 10:25:37] sircapsalot: yep, that's how you connect your node to your hub
[2015-04-22 10:25:41] mekhami: okay
[2015-04-22 10:25:50] mekhami: so if i were running both on the same machine it'd be localhost:4444
[2015-04-22 10:25:56] mekhami: but since it's two different machines i point to the right node
[2015-04-22 10:26:12] sircapsalot: if that doesn't work, i personally use -hubUrl http://ip.address:4444/grid/register  but i think -hub and -hubUrl are synonymous
[2015-04-22 10:26:42] mekhami: okay so these two are connected now
[2015-04-22 10:27:11] mekhami: so i what do i need to do about the browsers? are those installed with the selenium node or something or do i need to install chrome/firefox/ie etc
[2015-04-22 10:27:22] sircapsalot: then fire your tests off, against RemoteWebDriver() on the url:  http://ip.address:4444/wd/hub
[2015-04-22 10:27:46] sircapsalot: you need to do that yourself, on the target machine.  install whichever browsers you need
[2015-04-22 10:28:04] sircapsalot: (for arguments sake, lets say you are using chromedriver)
[2015-04-22 10:28:19] sircapsalot: you need to download chromedriver.exe (if windows)  and then in your node startup script, you can do something like:
[2015-04-22 10:28:50] sircapsalot: java -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -hub http://ip.address:4444/grid/register -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=C:\path\to\chromedriver.exe
[2015-04-22 10:29:15] sircapsalot: you'd of course need google chrome installed on the node.
[2015-04-22 10:29:19] sircapsalot: as well.

[2015-04-22 10:35:52] mekhami: yes and no
[2015-04-22 10:35:58] mekhami: the code exists but i don't have it yet

[2015-04-22 10:37:06] mekhami: locally, i assume
[2015-04-22 10:37:07] sircapsalot: just to see how you can point your tests to a grid
[2015-04-22 10:37:28] sircapsalot: if you download that, and change SampleFunctionalTest.java  (the hub = "") part, to http://ip.address:4444/wd/hub
[2015-04-22 10:37:43] sircapsalot: you'll see when you run one of those tests under there as "jUnit tests"  it'll run against your grid
[2015-04-22 10:39:19] mekhami: sorry what's the actual command to run the tests? i don't use java at all hah
[2015-04-22 10:39:31] mekhami: (i should learn it i suppose, it's a big one.)
[2015-04-22 10:40:27] sircapsalot: if you are using intellij,
[2015-04-22 10:40:47] mekhami: i'm not
[2015-04-22 10:40:53] sircapsalot: what are you using?
[2015-04-22 10:40:54] mekhami: i just using vim and the command line
[2015-04-22 10:41:00] sircapsalot: ok that's fine,
[2015-04-22 10:41:12] sircapsalot: just change that hub ="" part,

[2015-04-22 11:02:11] mekhami: changing the hub now and we'll see what happens
[2015-04-22 11:02:31] sircapsalot: watch the hub, and the node machine all at once
[2015-04-22 11:02:41] sircapsalot: as well as watching your console that you ran "mvn test" from
[2015-04-22 11:02:47] sircapsalot: you can see how it interacts
[2015-04-22 11:03:20] mekhami: heh got an error
[2015-04-22 11:03:23] sircapsalot: you fire off a  test from your local machine.. the test throws the hub a request, the hub then finds an available node, then runs those tests against the node.
[2015-04-22 11:03:29] kyoob: i should open source my first suite, written in perl
[2015-04-22 11:03:31] mekhami: i prob need webdrivers?
[2015-04-22 11:04:02] sircapsalot: yea - i said earlier that you need to do the -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=C:\Path\To\Chromedriver.exe  or whatever, attached to your java -jar command
[2015-04-22 11:04:08] kyoob: as an example of how not to do page objects

[2015-04-22 11:04:41] mekhami: but it's important that i can see that you only have to have the code locally where your'e running the actual tests

[2015-04-22 11:06:43] mekhami: i don't begin to understand how though
[2015-04-22 11:07:40] mhall_work, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-22 11:07:44] kyoob: your test code has always been sending instructions to some selenium server, usually one sitting on your local machine

[2015-04-22 11:08:25] mekhami: i can understand how the browser would load my page when the code is on the same machine as the selenium server
[2015-04-22 11:08:41] mekhami: but when i send my request to that server over there, how does that server have my application code to run

[2015-04-22 11:22:42] mekhami: do you happen to know where the executable would be for this? (I'm sorry I'm asking a bunch of really dumb questions because I'm still relatively new)
[2015-04-22 11:22:53] tuxtoti_: posted this sometime back, i guess it went unnoticed.
[2015-04-22 11:22:56] tuxtoti_: im using selenium v2.45 with the python binding. I'm using a EventFiringWebElement webdriver (to include a before_click event) . When i try to do a switch frame i get a TypeError : is not JSON serializable exception thrown .
[2015-04-22 11:23:02] tuxtoti_: works fine without the EventFiringWebElement !
[2015-04-22 11:23:21] tuxtoti_: any clues on how to debug this?
[2015-04-22 11:23:35] sircapsalot: mekhami :chromedriver
[2015-04-22 11:24:11] mekhami: okay so i'll start the node using -D to point to /usr/bin/google-chrome
[2015-04-22 11:24:20] sircapsalot: no, that's not the chromedriver
[2015-04-22 11:24:28] mekhami: err
[2015-04-22 11:24:29] mekhami: looking
[2015-04-22 11:24:39] sircapsalot: two pieces:  Chrome and chromedriver
[2015-04-22 11:25:00] sircapsalot: Chrome = usr/bin/google-chrome
[2015-04-22 11:25:13] sircapsalot: Chromedriver = (what you download from this page)
[2015-04-22 11:25:13] sircapsalot: http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html 
[2015-04-22 11:25:23] sircapsalot: you'lll download just an executable called "chromedriver"
[2015-04-22 11:26:05] mekhami: ok
[2015-04-22 11:26:11] mekhami: now i have both of those
[2015-04-22 11:26:37] sircapsalot: perfect.. now, set -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/path/to/chromedriver
[2015-04-22 11:27:05] sircapsalot: in your java -jar -role node -hubUrl http://ip.address:4444/grid/register -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/path/to/chromedriver
[2015-04-22 11:27:15] sircapsalot: this is all documented man :)
[2015-04-22 11:27:28] mekhami: yeah i know hah, and i am getting most of the way there.
[2015-04-22 11:27:41] mekhami: but some of it still makes my eyes glaze over a bit.

[2015-04-22 11:29:21] mekhami: so ic an run those tests hopefully
[2015-04-22 11:29:50] mekhami: hmm still an error.
[2015-04-22 11:29:58] sircapsalot: what did you set "hub" too?

[2015-04-22 12:51:30] SitamJana, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-22 12:51:32] dude-x: i think the --host parameter lets you specify the ip address to bind to as your public ip
[2015-04-22 12:51:52] mekhami: and i'd use that parameter for the hub?
[2015-04-22 12:51:57] dude-x: no for the node.
[2015-04-22 12:52:22] Dave_B_: you can specify lots of stuff for a node, including host
[2015-04-22 12:52:23] dude-x: hub too
[2015-04-22 12:52:40] dude-x: you can probably do it for all nodes and the hub so there's no guessing
[2015-04-22 12:52:45] mekhami: i used --host http://machineIPaddress --port 4444
[2015-04-22 12:52:48] mekhami: didn't change anything
[2015-04-22 12:52:48] Dave_B_: you can make all the config stuff as a single json file, makes your life easier
[2015-04-22 12:53:25] dude-x: don't need to specify port unless there's a conflict

[2015-04-22 13:09:10] dude-x: that's interesting
[2015-04-22 13:09:22] dude-x: the hub may be bound to the wrong ip address
[2015-04-22 13:09:32] dude-x: so pass --host on the hub
[2015-04-22 13:09:34] mekhami: but
[2015-04-22 13:09:45] mekhami: the hub says INFO - Got a request to create a new session: Capabilities blah blah blah

[2015-04-22 13:49:04] mekhami: yeah i know that's the whole problem here
[2015-04-22 13:49:49] lukeis: you're not specifying a config for the node?

[2015-04-22 13:50:21] mekhami: because i followed the docs and just am getting nowhere
[2015-04-22 13:50:24] lukeis: basically when you register a node with a hub, you need to tell the hub what kind of node you are, what browsers / platforms / etc
[2015-04-22 13:50:28] lukeis: :wiki grid2
[2015-04-22 13:50:44] mekhami: okay so i used the defaults, didn't I?

[2015-04-22 13:51:24] mekhami: sure
[2015-04-22 13:51:36] mekhami: shouldn't the other registrations happen?
[2015-04-22 13:51:39] lukeis: you need to explicitly configure your node
[2015-04-22 13:51:41] mekhami: i should still have access to the firefox and chrome
[2015-04-22 13:51:47] mekhami: ah

[2015-04-22 13:51:55] lukeis: heh :)

[2015-04-22 13:52:07] lukeis:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-04-22 13:52:17] lukeis: they work "sometimes"
[2015-04-22 13:52:45] lukeis: but it was originally debated having any defaults at all
[2015-04-22 13:52:53] mekhami: i woudl recommend against it if they're gonna be misleading.
[2015-04-22 13:52:58] mekhami: but i've gotta run, will work on this more later.
[2015-04-22 13:52:59] lukeis: as like you've encountered, it doesn't make sense most of the time

[2015-04-22 14:13:23] jimevans: i understand the reason for it. i don't agree with changing the client-facing API because of it, but i understand it.
[2015-04-22 14:13:43] barancev: lukeis: I want to talk to AutomatedTester first
[2015-04-22 14:13:59] lukeis:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[2015-04-22 14:14:21] lukeis: python bindings are not just for Firefox
[2015-04-22 14:14:59] lukeis: (or IEDriver for that fact)

[2015-04-22 14:18:46] barancev: but what to do with phantomjs and chrome?
[2015-04-22 14:18:46] jimevans: that changes with marionette, and the msft implementation
[2015-04-22 14:19:15] barancev: e.g. how to forece them implement getElemenRect?
[2015-04-22 14:20:35] barancev: yes, we can deliberately break a client binding and allow users to complain to a driver vendor

[2015-04-22 14:21:25] jimevans: that's what the spec is supposed to be for, but it's not in the state it needs to be in yet.

[2015-04-22 14:48:02] Khal: I believe thats in Java
[2015-04-22 14:48:08] Khal: the Keys.Chord
[2015-04-22 14:48:25] dude-x: you'll have to use the ActionChains API.

[2015-04-22 15:11:11] lukeis: this sounds like a synthetic event vs. native event thing… and native + firefox + OSX == no dice

[2015-04-22 15:12:53] dude-x: you need native events for control-A?
[2015-04-22 15:13:15] lukeis: if you're trying to "highlight the whole page" … yes
[2015-04-22 15:13:36] lukeis: if you have an element that listens for control-a events, then no
[2015-04-22 15:13:45] dude-x: oh.
[2015-04-22 15:13:54] dude-x: what if you click into a element.
[2015-04-22 15:14:03] dude-x: well i don't think synthetic clicks work
[2015-04-22 15:14:05] lukeis: that's still native events

[2015-04-22 15:15:03] dude-x: Chrome now has "native events" on the Mac
[2015-04-22 15:15:20] lukeis: yeah, but i just tried cmd-a and that didn't work ;)
[2015-04-22 15:15:44] dude-x: but you can click on select dropdowns in chrome
