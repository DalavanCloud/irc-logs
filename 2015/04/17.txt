[2015-04-17 07:24:29] eindoofus: is that still the case?

[2015-04-17 07:26:58] Dave_B_: Grid is good for running tests in parallel or against several browsers at once
[2015-04-17 07:27:10] WhereIsMySpoon: grid has nothing especially to do with load testing
[2015-04-17 07:27:14] sircapsalot: or just so you don't have to clutter your machine with browsers.
[2015-04-17 07:27:24] Dave_B_: that too
[2015-04-17 07:28:18] eindoofus: oh. if the only two browsers we plan to support are chrome/firefox can you picture any need for it?
[2015-04-17 07:28:47] sircapsalot: it's totally subjective eindoofus.  we are ignorant of what you need, and what you plan on doing
[2015-04-17 07:29:20] WhereIsMySpoon: eindoofus: sure, there could be

[2015-04-17 07:34:55] sircapsalot: yes eindoofus.  they are mutually exclusive, and can be used in conjuction

[2015-04-17 07:35:32] WhereIsMySpoon: eindoofus: you should really look up what Grid actually is
[2015-04-17 07:35:33] sircapsalot: I did write down your question though, eindoofus seleniumhq/docs#70
[2015-04-17 07:35:36] WhereIsMySpoon: if you knew you wouldnt ask that
[2015-04-17 07:35:48] Dave_B_: grid basically  gives you the ability to have the browsers somewhere else - it makes no difference to your test runner or anything like that
[2015-04-17 07:36:18] Dave_B_: it helps enable parallel execution and stuff, but doesn't actually do the parallelisation, that's down to you.
[2015-04-17 07:36:25] Dave_B_: likewise cross-browser
[2015-04-17 07:36:59] sircapsalot: "Computers are stupid machines that can do great things."  that paradigm fits selenium.. selenium is stupid, so is jUnit.  so is the grid. it's all what you do with it and how you integrate it ;)

[2015-04-17 16:34:07] leandroal: Hi... I run my tests in a selenium server. One of my tests downloads a file and I need to open the file to check its content. I use RemoteWebDriver to run the test in the server. The file downloaded is stored in the server but I need to open the file in the machine that runs the script. How can I get a file stored in the server?

[2015-04-17 17:59:53] leandroal: Is it possible to use the RemoteWebDriver connection to the selenium server in the port 4444 to get a file in the server downloaded during the test by my test script?
[2015-04-17 18:08:49] leandroal: Hi,
[2015-04-17 18:08:49] leandroal:    If I run my test in a remote browser using RemoteWebDriver, the browser will open in a selenium server. If my script downloads a file during the test, the downloaded file will be stored in the server. I need to get access to the downloaded file to check its content and verify its correctness according to my business logic. Is it possible to use the RemoteWebDriver instance to download a file that is stored in the remote server?
