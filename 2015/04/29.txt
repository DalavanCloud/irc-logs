[2015-04-29 08:36:01] simonstewart: Which one?

[2015-04-29 08:36:19] simonstewart: Because it's a fucking terrible idea

[2015-04-29 08:36:37] MonkeysPaw: cweng: I've had chrome do the same damn thing to me. FF and IE will work fine -ish, and chrome will behave for several tests and then it will just crap its pants for no discernable reason.
[2015-04-29 08:36:55] MonkeysPaw: So I'll tack in a wait.
[2015-04-29 08:37:06] simonstewart: Maven destroys your ability to actually manage your third party deps while pretending it's helping
[2015-04-29 08:37:17] MonkeysPaw: I've been given the impression that explicit waits are preferable to implicit waits, however.
[2015-04-29 08:37:30] simonstewart: Downloading required deps from the web at build time destroys build times (natch) and increases build fragility
[2015-04-29 08:37:47] simonstewart: And means that someone who's frequently offline or has shitty connectivity can't do work
[2015-04-29 08:38:09] simonstewart: Until recently maven's public repos were only available over HTTP, leaving your builds open to MITM attacks

[2015-04-29 08:48:05] alko: simonstewart: maven was a huge improvement over life before maven, and assuming all your dependencies are already on your local repo you don't need to get any of them over the web
[2015-04-29 08:48:16] alko: also, they can all be in a local repository on your local network
[2015-04-29 08:48:25] eindoofus, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-29 08:48:34] alko: it is rather handy for managing multiple layers of internal builds as well.
[2015-04-29 08:48:49] alko: the security issues are an interesting topic though.
[2015-04-29 08:49:12] alko: the best thing about maven now perhaps though is that it is a standard.
[2015-04-29 08:50:22] alko: it is rather self-evident though that i have different ideas about what is a best practice than the powers that be in this community, but what i found most frustrating was how difficult it was to load the java based grid code into an ide to debug it
[2015-04-29 08:50:58] alko: when i asked others how they debugged it seemed to be by adding System.out.println() statements to the code and rebuilding it...
[2015-04-29 08:51:15] alko: i am intrigued as to why people hate maven so much though :)
[2015-04-29 08:51:26] WhereIsMySpoon: i dont

[2015-04-29 08:52:20] mhall_work: I still don't see what the selling point of grid is though. Sounds to me like alot of pain for little benefit
[2015-04-29 08:52:25] alko: yup
[2015-04-29 08:52:26] cristi, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-29 08:52:41] alko: i didn't have so much pain with grid, and a lot of benefit
[2015-04-29 08:52:53] alko: we had hundreds of vms running different oss, browsers, versions
[2015-04-29 08:53:00] mhall_work: if you don't mind giving me a few lines on it, learn me
[2015-04-29 08:53:09] WhereIsMySpoon: mhall_work: grid allows you to have your actual testing run on a separate vm/pc than the CI vm/pc
[2015-04-29 08:53:24] alko: and could run tons of tests in parallel via jenkins on all the browsers / vms / versions we wanted
[2015-04-29 08:53:25] WhereIsMySpoon: mhall_work: it is especially useful if you have a huge CI system and need to run multiple tests at once
[2015-04-29 08:53:43] WhereIsMySpoon: but even for a small CI system with one node it is useful
[2015-04-29 08:54:20] mhall_work: so I hadn't thought about the idea of running tests on something other than the CI slave in that way, that's interesting.
[2015-04-29 08:54:29] mhall_work: We use browserstack
[2015-04-29 08:54:33] alko: in my experience, CI works best when all the tests can be run quickly, so that developers don't have to wait a long time after they commit to see if they broke anything
[2015-04-29 08:54:37] mhall_work: so thus, grid is moot for me
[2015-04-29 08:54:45] alko: i want to check that out - that is essentiall grid, outsourced to the cloud
[2015-04-29 08:54:53] mhall_work: alko +1
[2015-04-29 08:54:54] alko: we tried using saucelabs but it was so slow it was a joke
[2015-04-29 08:55:01] mhall_work: yeah saucelabs is saddening
[2015-04-29 08:55:04] eindoofus: we have a dashboard and up till now i've been throwing every method into the same DashboardPage page object, and every method happily returns the same DashboardPage object after I perform a method like searchDropdown(...). however, there is a part of the dashboard that is more complex and it would make sense to break it out if i can into another Page Object, however, i'm worried about loosing the flexibility i have now once i create a
[2015-04-29 08:55:04] eindoofus: DashboardSomeComponentPage object and enter that.
[2015-04-29 08:55:14] alko: others are also using cloud providers like aws
[2015-04-29 08:55:26] WhereIsMySpoon: eindoofus: have it inherit from the DashboardPage?
[2015-04-29 08:55:38] mhall_work: ^^^
[2015-04-29 08:55:38] joshin4colours: my 2 cents
[2015-04-29 08:55:57] alko: when i get back home i am going to setup and run some benchmarks on cloud vm provider vs outsourced vs locally hosted solution performance
[2015-04-29 08:55:58] simonstewart: alko: Just open the selenium project in IntelliJ or Eclipse.
[2015-04-29 08:56:03] simonstewart: Everything works
[2015-04-29 08:56:04] joshin4colours: conceptually, maven is great, but in practice it can lead to crappy situations
[2015-04-29 08:56:08] eindoofus: makes sense. but what do i keep in the DashboardPage object and what do i put in subclasses?
[2015-04-29 08:56:14] WhereIsMySpoon: eindoofus: thats up to you
[2015-04-29 08:56:24] joshin4colours: sometimes our project "breaks" because our dependencies are out of date/incorrect
[2015-04-29 08:56:26] alko: if i am wrong then ok
[2015-04-29 08:56:26] WhereIsMySpoon: eindoofus: but in a nutshell - put stuff in dashboardpage that is common to both the widget and the page
[2015-04-29 08:56:31] joshin4colours: but we have no way of knowing until we build/run stuff
[2015-04-29 08:56:39] joshin4colours: because it's hidden away by mvn
[2015-04-29 08:56:45] alko: simonstewart: i tried but at the time it wasn't working for me and all the people i asked didn't know how to :)
[2015-04-29 08:56:45] mhall_work: alko: keep me posted on that
[2015-04-29 08:56:53] alko: mhall_work: will do
[2015-04-29 08:56:57] eindoofus: sounds good. thanks
[2015-04-29 08:56:57] simonstewart: My beef with maven is manifold. Other than the fact that it doesn't solve the dependencies issue (it just makes it feel that way), the code layout is unpleasant, the tool itself is slow, doesn't parallelise well and doesn't provide repeatable builds
[2015-04-29 08:56:59] WhereIsMySpoon: eindoofus: say you have a "home" button, you keep that in the dashboardpage as you might wanna press it from the widget

[2015-04-29 09:03:08] mhall_work: And I totally get that. But for me, for the webapps that I work on, it's an ideal solution. Single hosting environment, single language, etc.

[2015-04-29 09:04:10] simonstewart: So, yeah. That's what I think :)
[2015-04-29 09:04:11] mhall_work: It's quick if you call your phases explicitly, if you let it run through the whole lifecycle each time then yea
[2015-04-29 09:04:27] alko: simonstewart: thank you for that
[2015-04-29 09:04:34] mhall_work: On the same note, alot of folks like gradle, which I abhor.
[2015-04-29 09:04:34] simonstewart: By design a no-op build in maven is going to slower than in something like buck
[2015-04-29 09:04:44] alko: it seems we have started some discussion here :)
[2015-04-29 09:04:57] mhall_work: and I have no idea what buck is

[2015-04-29 09:11:47] WhereIsMySpoon: it has some banks there
[2015-04-29 09:11:56] WhereIsMySpoon: i wouldnt say it was the wall st of london
[2015-04-29 09:12:02] dude-x: then what is?

[2015-04-29 09:15:25] WhereIsMySpoon: thats £2100

[2015-04-29 09:15:36] WhereIsMySpoon: thats pretty insane

[2015-04-29 09:15:43] WhereIsMySpoon: thats a lot more than london i think
[2015-04-29 09:15:47] dude-x: as a native new yorker i don't care for anything else outside of manhattan
[2015-04-29 09:15:48] mekhami: anywhere close to manhattan though is still 1500+ for a small studio

[2015-04-29 09:16:25] dchef: How do I target ie 9, 10, 11 browsers while still keeping their full version info e.g. 10.0.9200.17267
[2015-04-29 09:16:27] alko: now that would get me a studio :D

[2015-04-29 09:17:20] mekhami: and we're talkign crappy places
[2015-04-29 09:17:20] mekhami: in 1920? how
[2015-04-29 09:17:27] simonstewart: dchef: I'm sure that jimevans can tell you, but the Capabilities returned from the getCapabilities method should have the actual version number in it

[2015-04-29 09:17:48] dchef: so for capabiliities.setVersion('10.*') and it would select 10.0.9200.17267
[2015-04-29 09:18:10] WhereIsMySpoon: alko: I pay £560/mo for a 1 bedroom house share, not even my own bathroom or kitchen or anything

[2015-04-29 09:18:55] jimevans: dchef: setting the version to 10 should get you what you want, if i recall correctly.
[2015-04-29 09:18:56] WhereIsMySpoon: alko: not quite as simple as that :P
[2015-04-29 09:19:02] simonstewart: But check the returned value to be sure you got what you wanted

[2015-04-29 09:25:58] MonkeysPaw: cweng: Depends on what I'm trying to do. The great thing about an explicit wait is that it will keep trying to perform the target task until it either gets it or it fails out. You may want to just wrap that test in a try catch.
[2015-04-29 09:26:20] jimevans: so the box is provisioned, and part of that provisioning process writes the configuration file for when the node is launched?
[2015-04-29 09:26:28] dchef: yes
[2015-04-29 09:26:36] jimevans: then fix your configuration process :)
[2015-04-29 09:26:53] jimevans: or create a custom capability matcher for your grid.

[2015-04-29 09:28:07] dchef: so it is not important to know what exact version you are testing against?
[2015-04-29 09:28:48] jimevans: it may or may not be. however, the IE driver doesn't make the distinction. it only reports major version number of IE, so it doesn't really care.
[2015-04-29 09:29:24] cweng: MonkeysPaw: its not the tests failing, its the browser crashing
[2015-04-29 09:29:26] jimevans: and please note that i'm speaking solely about the IE driver here. i've only a passing familiarity with the inner workings of the java code making up the server.
[2015-04-29 09:29:28] dchef: i can set it to major version, but is there another placeholder to capture full version?
[2015-04-29 09:30:02] jimevans: not that will get passed all the way back to the client via capabilities, no.
[2015-04-29 09:30:03] dchef: so when i view the node from hub, i can extract that info?
[2015-04-29 09:30:18] jimevans: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-04-29 09:30:32] sircapsalot: ok… well. i'm back from lunch, and holy shit what a discussion.

[2015-04-29 09:30:55] jimevans: keyboard shortcut for os x.
[2015-04-29 09:30:56] jimevans: :)
[2015-04-29 09:31:00] MonkeysPaw: cweng: well yeah, but what was the last test that it executed before it crashed? Because that's where I would start looking for a problem.
[2015-04-29 09:31:01] WhereIsMySpoon: ah
[2015-04-29 09:31:13] MonkeysPaw: And what happens if you just skip or ignore that test?
[2015-04-29 09:31:14] dchef: no regex support on matching version

[2015-04-29 09:38:48] alko: done before, focussed on more of a single product company.

[2015-04-29 09:50:25] WhereIsMySpoon: eindoofus: all the browser drivers are supposed to be "clean slates" each time a new instance of one is spawned
[2015-04-29 09:50:37] WhereIsMySpoon: hence why you have people injecting cookies for logins and such
[2015-04-29 09:51:58] eindoofus: that's strange. the dev recently fixed the login textboxes to show text and after refreshing it in my personal firefox it works fine, but in the firefoxdriver instance it still has the old issue, almost as though it cached the old page.
[2015-04-29 09:52:56] eindoofus: nm, i'm wrong about that

[2015-04-29 10:52:49] joesmith: jimevans: are you recommending implicit waits only? i want to have some allowed time for elements to become visible, but i also want to be able to wait for something to happen on the page (like an element no longer visible)
[2015-04-29 10:53:03] jleyba: joesmith, use explicit waits only
[2015-04-29 10:53:13] jimevans: joesmith: i recommend so-called explicit waits (e.g. webdriverwait) only
[2015-04-29 10:53:35] joesmith: wow, i feel like everything i've read has said only to use implicit waits!

[2015-04-29 10:54:27] joesmith: jimevans: so you would wrap every element selector in a webdriverwait then?
[2015-04-29 10:54:29] jimevans: i'd gladly throw implicit waits out of the webdriver api altogether
[2015-04-29 10:55:57] jimevans: not explicitly every time i needed to wait, no. i'd create a helper method in my framework that i could call whenever i needed to (avoiding the whole, "but webdriverwait looks so *ugly* in my code" argument)

[2015-04-29 10:56:42] joesmith: i was thinking implicit waits make the code more resilient (if theres an unexpected little delay/page load somewhere)
[2015-04-29 10:56:59] joesmith: but seems like the opposite is wrapping every single call in a webdriverwait/helper

[2015-04-29 10:57:39] jimevans: by making the wait explicit via the use of webdriverwait, you're intention in the code is much more clear.

[2015-04-29 12:17:31] eindoofus_: ml")

[2015-04-29 12:20:39] ericmeds, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-29 12:20:46] jimevans: i'd have a static method off the DashboardPage object, like navigateDirect(), which would take a WebDriver object as a parameter and use it to grab the cookie, navigate to the appropriate page, create an instance of the DashboardPage object, and return it.
[2015-04-29 12:23:54] smccarthy: eindoofus_: What I have done is have two constructors. One that just has a WebDriver object as a parameter, and the other might have a WebDriver object and a Cookie as a parameter. So in your test if you call the one with the WebDriver object and Cookie, it can insert the cookie into the driver object and get the page.

[2015-04-29 12:52:34] cweng: Thanks looking through it
[2015-04-29 12:55:03] cweng: Speed is an issue to if that matters.

[2015-04-29 14:16:08] gabecase: cweng ^
[2015-04-29 14:16:11] gabecase: thats a decent start
[2015-04-29 14:16:31] gabecase: Id ignore the domain driven design link since its focus is on some book
[2015-04-29 14:16:54] gabecase: but the parts on page objects and loadable component is on point
[2015-04-29 14:17:55] oida, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-29 14:20:14] cweng: Is there any other recommended material for building frameworks?
[2015-04-29 14:23:55] gabecase: your looking more for guidance for building a full solution around selenium
[2015-04-29 14:24:00] gabecase: which requires alot of moving parts
[2015-04-29 14:24:08] gabecase: well not requires but
[2015-04-29 14:24:21] gabecase: when you start factoring in CI/CD etc...
[2015-04-29 14:24:30] gabecase: its alot more then just the test code at that point
[2015-04-29 14:25:13] cweng: Well, any help would be great
[2015-04-29 14:26:00] gabecase: Im making some curriculum around test automation using the lessons learned from the framework I built for my previous company
[2015-04-29 14:26:07] gabecase: which was microsoft/.NET focused
[2015-04-29 14:26:35] gabecase: you might find that useful but its not ready for publish yet
[2015-04-29 14:27:07] gabecase: if you want to do a QA you can ping me here and we could set up a time
[2015-04-29 14:27:33] gabecase: I might be able to fill in some of the gaps with the design of your solution
[2015-04-29 14:27:46] cweng: that would be very helpful
[2015-04-29 14:28:49] cweng: I originally had page object implemented for my project, but that screwed a lot of the parallel test results, and it was after we removed the pageojbect when parallel testing became more consistent
