[2015-04-30 01:31:02] lazymanc: http://pastebin.com/eyzKF2XL - as you can see it succeeds but takes about 23 seconds on chrome

[2015-04-30 01:31:39] lazymanc: and it also succeeds in firefox but is much slower
[2015-04-30 01:32:46] lazymanc: the text is an error message inserted into the DOM by jQuery, and I can see it appear immediately as it should do and then there's a long delay before selenium detects it

[2015-04-30 02:25:23] Dave_B_1: anyone in here handled nested iframes much? A product change here is going in that will give me a set of nested iframes and not really sure how/where to handle the frame switching - i'd rather my tests don't know about it, but to do it in the POM is looking messy
[2015-04-30 02:27:58] Padawan_, quitting. (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[2015-04-30 02:28:13] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_1: is there important content in each nested frame?
[2015-04-30 02:28:24] Dave_B_1: some but not all
[2015-04-30 02:28:56] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe just create a PoM for each important iframe and from the top parent iframe create methods to get to each one
[2015-04-30 02:29:07] Dave_B_1: i've made a model for each frame and the inner most one is jsut an externally provided form so only got a single method to input stuff, so the frame sweitching there is easy
[2015-04-30 02:29:10] WhereIsMySpoon: well...top parent html element
[2015-04-30 02:29:14] Padawan_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-30 02:29:35] Dave_B_1: yeah that's what I'm doing at the moment, the parent page is handling it all :p
[2015-04-30 02:30:12] Dave_B_1: I'd be so much happier without iframes in the product, especially nested ones :(
[2015-04-30 02:30:29] WhereIsMySpoon: you can have each child iframe PoM inherit from that and have a protected method that goes back to the main parent element
[2015-04-30 02:30:42] WhereIsMySpoon: that way you can do someNestedFrame.goToParent().goToOtherFrame()
[2015-04-30 02:30:53] Dave_B_1: ahh not a bad idea
[2015-04-30 02:31:01] Dave_B_1: I'm building from the bottom each time
[2015-04-30 02:31:04] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2015-04-30 02:31:05] Dave_B_1: which is just dumb

[2015-04-30 02:31:24] WhereIsMySpoon: go for it
[2015-04-30 02:33:28] WhereIsMySpoon: I can imagine going driver.switchTo().frame("blah").switchTo().frame("foo")...... every time must get annoying
[2015-04-30 02:33:33] WhereIsMySpoon: to get to one 6 frames down
[2015-04-30 02:33:34] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2015-04-30 02:34:28] Dave_B_1: luckily we're 'only' 3 frames deep inside the original page
[2015-04-30 02:34:38] Dave_B_1: but even so it was a bit tedious
[2015-04-30 02:36:51] Dave_B_1: all in the name of 'compliance' - sometimes work makes me sad
[2015-04-30 02:37:19] Dave_B_1, changing nick to Dave_B_.
[2015-04-30 02:59:54] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: compliance of what? shitty html standards/
[2015-04-30 02:59:55] WhereIsMySpoon: ?*
[2015-04-30 03:01:06] Dave_B_: so it would seem
[2015-04-30 03:01:51] Dave_B_: some garbage about how we handle card details - apparently the people who do our compliance audit are under the impression sticking stuff in iframes makes it all super secure and not using them can never be secure
[2015-04-30 03:02:14] Dave_B_: I've had no contact with them but I'm led to believe it was a frustrating experience
[2015-04-30 03:02:27] WhereIsMySpoon: wtf
[2015-04-30 03:02:44] WhereIsMySpoon: non technical people doing technical audits is the worst
[2015-04-30 03:02:55] WhereIsMySpoon: "i read a blog about iframes once and now omg iframes"
[2015-04-30 03:03:08] Dave_B_: pretty much
[2015-04-30 03:03:20] Dave_B_: lots of facepalming
[2015-04-30 03:04:01] Dave_B_: I was involved in a bunch of investors 'due diligence' stuff where non-technical people would ask me a bunch of questions about how our deployment pipeline wored
[2015-04-30 03:04:10] Dave_B_: it was brutal too
[2015-04-30 03:04:39] Dave_B_: the questions didn't make sense, they didn't connect to each other, they'd ask things that I'd already answered presumably cause they didn't know - what they thought they got from it I don't know
[2015-04-30 03:06:44] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: sounds like a nice waste of your time
[2015-04-30 03:06:53] WhereIsMySpoon: lots of box ticking
[2015-04-30 03:07:58] Dave_B_: yep, all about box ticking - the head of engineering was quite open that that's what it was going to be going in and apologised for it being a waste of time, but if it gets us further investment at good rates then it's worth doing, soâ€¦ :S not my cup of tea
[2015-04-30 03:08:40] WhereIsMySpoon: i know the one
[2015-04-30 03:09:15] WhereIsMySpoon: though the auditors we get are a little more competent
[2015-04-30 03:09:22] WhereIsMySpoon: still lots of box ticking
[2015-04-30 03:14:05] Dave_B_: maybe as we get bigger we'll get better auditors - which I guess will be a good thing

[2015-04-30 08:38:49] cweng: My tests are running when run individually, but freezes chrome after 40 or so tests
[2015-04-30 08:39:18] cweng: They will still pass when run in groups of 30, but fail afterward
[2015-04-30 08:39:22] WhereIsMySpoon: cweng: are you still not shutting down chrome with driver.quit after each test?
[2015-04-30 08:39:48] cweng: My boss wants to have faster test results, so he doesn't want browser to quit
[2015-04-30 08:40:13] Dave_B_: he'll get faster test results by running tests separately and then using the wonder of parallel execution
[2015-04-30 08:40:21] Dave_B_: also broken tests serve nobody well

[2015-04-30 08:42:31] WhereIsMySpoon: cweng: would you rather have correct, reliable tests that are slower or wonky unreliable broken tests that are faster
[2015-04-30 08:42:33] cweng: We also use config manager through VS if that affects anything
[2015-04-30 08:42:38] WhereIsMySpoon: why bother testing if you're comprimising
[2015-04-30 08:42:55] dude-x: if your org doesn't understand that, you're going to go bonkers if they don't give you resorces to address issues
[2015-04-30 08:42:59] dhoer: Chef IE cookbook 2.0.0 is released with support for disabling enhanced security, enabling bfcache, configuring zones, and setting zoom
[2015-04-30 08:43:01] cweng: I would rather just have slow correct tests, but my boss would rather have correct fast tests lol
[2015-04-30 08:43:09] WhereIsMySpoon: cweng: ofc he would
[2015-04-30 08:43:17] WhereIsMySpoon: cweng: but it isnt possible to leave the frigging thing open for 40 tests
[2015-04-30 08:43:25] WhereIsMySpoon: cweng: quitting and reopening takes a few seconds
[2015-04-30 08:43:37] WhereIsMySpoon: really, tell him to stop quibbling over a few seconds of extra test time
[2015-04-30 08:43:42] cweng: it adds up though after like a thousand tests
[2015-04-30 08:44:08] cweng: I'm just trying to figure out my options before I just give up lol
[2015-04-30 08:44:27] cweng: Firefox and IE work fine not closing out so I dunno

[2015-04-30 08:44:52] kyoob: the answer is parallel tests.  might be time to revisit it
[2015-04-30 08:45:05] kyoob: you're not going to be able to get chrome to perform well under these conditions
[2015-04-30 08:45:08] WhereIsMySpoon: cweng: if your boss wants quick and reliable he needs parallelisation
[2015-04-30 08:45:14] WhereIsMySpoon: end of storyu

[2015-04-30 08:45:31] gabecase: if its speed you seek
[2015-04-30 08:45:35] kyoob: 1000 ui tests not running in parallel is a lot even if the browser is performing perfectly
[2015-04-30 08:45:48] cweng: stuff keeps breaking
[2015-04-30 08:45:53] Dave_B_: what test runner you using?
[2015-04-30 08:46:03] Dave_B_: also do your tests rely on stuff from other tests?
[2015-04-30 08:46:05] cweng: Xunit

[2015-04-30 08:47:20] Dave_B_: remember to set an execution timeout that is sensible though, the default assumes you're running a unit test so is very short
[2015-04-30 08:49:14] dhoer: Safari extension applescript fails consistently on 'System Events'. I would like to get this stable.  I might try JXA if applescript can't be fixed.
[2015-04-30 08:49:44] cweng: I also heard that app config messes with selenium testing. is that true?

[2015-04-30 08:52:07] jimevans: huh?
[2015-04-30 08:52:10] dude-x: cweng: so this is how we address parallelization, one is the idea of having a fixture library, we create the data set that the application will use for UI tests. This way if two tests run at the same time, we use separate accounts so that there is no stomping over data in parallel
[2015-04-30 08:53:06] eindoofus_: is there any simple way to wait for a webelement to load? find a lot of complex answers and left questioning if there isn't a more simple solution

[2015-04-30 08:53:28] WhereIsMySpoon: eindoofus_: explicit waits
[2015-04-30 08:53:34] WhereIsMySpoon: eindoofus_: if java, WebDriverWait
[2015-04-30 08:53:45] cweng: we write an extension method for findelement called waitforelement
[2015-04-30 08:53:49] eindoofus_: does it really need to be implemented like this?: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19851518/selenium-webdriver-wait-for-element-to-be-present-when-locating-with-webdriver
[2015-04-30 08:54:11] WhereIsMySpoon: no
[2015-04-30 08:54:16] WhereIsMySpoon: there is a support class for java

[2015-04-30 08:55:34] eindoofus_: that's alright. should be able to figure it out from there
[2015-04-30 08:55:57] Dave_B_: it's one of the things that bugs me about some of the 'our tool is like selenium but better' pages â€¦ they always make a hash of waiting in their 'comparison' examples
[2015-04-30 08:56:23] cweng: jimevans: right now we're using a configuration manager so we can easily change drivers through VS ui, wondering if that will affect driver performance

[2015-04-30 08:57:31] cweng: WhereIsMySpoon: he asked huh? so I was explaining
[2015-04-30 08:57:46] jimevans: cweng: i honestly can't imagine how that would have any effect at all on driver performance, but the proverbial devil, as they say, is in the details

[2015-04-30 09:23:31] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: for multithreading?
[2015-04-30 09:23:48] Dave_B_: it's just reinventing the polling stuff, thought that was used differently for a secx
[2015-04-30 09:23:52] Dave_B_: -x
[2015-04-30 09:24:02] jimevans: nah, that'll be fine, as long as driver instances are suitably isolated on threads.
[2015-04-30 09:24:12] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: like they wont be with a singleton :p
[2015-04-30 09:24:26] jimevans: but essentially, that's what WebDriverWait does.
[2015-04-30 09:24:30] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2015-04-30 09:24:40] WhereIsMySpoon: oki then
[2015-04-30 09:24:55] jimevans: defines a suitably small polling interval, and polls once per interval until success or the timeout is reached.
[2015-04-30 09:25:31] jimevans: it's a little bit reinventing the wheel, since the .NET bindings already provide a WebDriverWait, that's incredibly configurable.

[2015-04-30 09:27:52] jimevans: err, no, that's not what i'm recommending at all.
[2015-04-30 09:28:09] cweng: How should I have the driver set up then?

[2015-04-30 09:36:22] eindoofus_: any suggestions for a lightweight method of dynamically persisting token data in a maven/java project? when a user logs in they recieve a token via a cookie, and that token may change if the token expires or user logs out. would like to store the token (or cookie) information for retrieval in future runs of the application. already storing the user's username/password in a static json file that i read from before beginning a run.
[2015-04-30 09:36:32] jimevans: something like this: https://github.com/jimevans/WebDriverProxyExamples/blob/master/WebDriverProxyUtilities/WebDriverFactory.cs
[2015-04-30 09:36:42] jimevans: though i wouldn't copy/paste that.
[2015-04-30 09:37:00] jimevans: i'd probably resort to something using reflection for creating the driver.

[2015-04-30 09:39:51] jimevans: AnConio: that looks to me like firefox driver stuff. remember that the firefox driver creates an anonymous profile for every instantiation.
[2015-04-30 09:40:00] jimevans: yes, usually in the temp directory
[2015-04-30 09:40:35] jimevans: it's *supposed* to be cleaned up if you properly dispose of the driver using driver.quit()
[2015-04-30 09:40:40] AnConio: yep...I thought so too
[2015-04-30 09:41:03] AnConio: he he he, well alright, I admit...I don't always use driver.close or driver.quit
[2015-04-30 09:41:17] AnConio: namely cause I wanna see the progress of the tests executing so far...
[2015-04-30 09:41:29] WhereIsMySpoon: AnConio: i do the same sometimes when debugging :)
[2015-04-30 09:41:31] WhereIsMySpoon: just comment it
[2015-04-30 09:41:33] jimevans: that's a recipe for filling up your temp directory with lots of abandoned profiles, then.
[2015-04-30 09:41:47] AnConio: yes...I know in the future I'll be cleaner about it
[2015-04-30 09:42:04] AnConio: but for example we just instituted a session time out warning at 15 mins.
[2015-04-30 09:42:12] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe put a debug pointer on the driver.quit line and run your tests under debug mode
[2015-04-30 09:42:14] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2015-04-30 09:42:26] AnConio: so I wanted to see that take effect and I would let webdriver just sit there and not close the browser

[2015-04-30 09:43:35] AnConio: the problem also now is that security on these boxes is so clamped down tight that I can't simply delete this files myself
[2015-04-30 09:44:03] WhereIsMySpoon: AnConio: maybe firefox can though?...

[2015-04-30 09:44:23] AnConio: i have to open up a service desk help ticket so I can get someone to apply admin credentials so I can remove these junk files
[2015-04-30 09:44:42] WhereIsMySpoon: dont know if that will work but worth a go/
[2015-04-30 09:44:44] jimevans: cweng: that example was just that, an example. the project it's taken from exists to demonstrate using proxies with webdriver to do things webdriver isn't meant to do
[2015-04-30 09:44:46] AnConio: woah? Firefox console?
[2015-04-30 09:44:56] WhereIsMySpoon: ....
[2015-04-30 09:45:01] WhereIsMySpoon: AnConio: open firefox, press f12
[2015-04-30 09:45:01] jimevans: like capture javascript errors, or get the status code of http responses to the browser.
[2015-04-30 09:45:23] AnConio: yeah I got that open...Firebug
[2015-04-30 09:45:34] jimevans: cweng: that's why i said "don't just copy that code"
[2015-04-30 09:45:36] WhereIsMySpoon: sure, whatever
[2015-04-30 09:45:40] WhereIsMySpoon: dev tools
[2015-04-30 09:45:51] WhereIsMySpoon: then try using js from the console to execute system calls
[2015-04-30 09:45:53] AnConio: yep, I'm there
[2015-04-30 09:45:53] WhereIsMySpoon: to remove those files
[2015-04-30 09:46:04] AnConio: oh...I see
[2015-04-30 09:46:06] WhereIsMySpoon: i dunno if it will work :p
[2015-04-30 09:46:49] WhereIsMySpoon: i guess firefox is installed as admin
[2015-04-30 09:46:52] WhereIsMySpoon: and not at user level

[2015-04-30 09:48:59] AnConio: I really need to become a pro at using "dev tools"
[2015-04-30 09:49:23] WhereIsMySpoon: i use dev tools in all browsers constantly
[2015-04-30 09:49:37] WhereIsMySpoon: i just wish ie8 had some decent ones..
[2015-04-30 09:49:45] WhereIsMySpoon: they were only added in ie10 i think
[2015-04-30 09:49:55] WhereIsMySpoon: and even then they are sup par
[2015-04-30 09:50:00] WhereIsMySpoon: sub*
[2015-04-30 09:50:13] WhereIsMySpoon: chrome's are the best imo
[2015-04-30 09:50:20] AnConio: not that I've searched it yet...nor do I particularly want to go buy yet another book...but any references on "mastering dev tools"?
[2015-04-30 09:50:26] WhereIsMySpoon: use them
[2015-04-30 09:50:43] WhereIsMySpoon: there isnt a massive amount of depth to them for day to day use

[2015-04-30 09:51:16] WhereIsMySpoon: use inspector to inspect elements, use console for small js scripting and viewing errors on page, use debugger for stepping through js scripts
[2015-04-30 09:51:20] AnConio: yeah, IE10 has them but I've not really used them....still mostly just use FF and Firebug...although I believe Firebug will be dying or morphing some time soon?
[2015-04-30 09:51:22] WhereIsMySpoon: use network to inspect calls
[2015-04-30 09:51:30] WhereIsMySpoon: no idea i dont rly use firefox
[2015-04-30 09:52:17] AnConio: I think I read a post, on Firebug's website, about the future of Firebug now that FF has it's own set of dev tools
[2015-04-30 09:52:46] AnConio: and it seemed to me like they weren't really interested in competing with FF's dev tools...but rather to complement them
[2015-04-30 09:53:04] WhereIsMySpoon: ive never used firebug
[2015-04-30 09:53:11] WhereIsMySpoon: only ff's dev tools

[2015-04-30 11:17:07] jimevans: driver.Close() followed by driver.Dispose() is redundant
[2015-04-30 11:17:52] cweng: Tests also call Driver.Interface for find elements and regular tests
[2015-04-30 11:18:49] eindoofus_: running into a really bizarre scenario with this code. have a LoginPage object that enters username, password, and clicks submit on "#login-form button" using By.cssSelector, and returns a DashboardPage object. all is fine till i use the following chunk of code in the DashboardPage constructor after assigning the driver:
[2015-04-30 11:19:07] jimevans: eindoofus_: please use :gist
[2015-04-30 11:19:11] jimevans: or similar
[2015-04-30 11:19:21] eindoofus_: oh. will do
[2015-04-30 11:20:07] jimevans: cweng: your framework seems somewhat convoluted. perhaps unnecessarily so.
[2015-04-30 11:20:34] cweng: jimevans: any tips for refactoring?
[2015-04-30 11:21:20] jimevans: cweng: i can't be very specific, sorry. but the first thing i'd do is allow one and only one way to access your driver instance.
[2015-04-30 11:21:22] eindoofus_: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d6f3580a9ed32bcf4d6d
[2015-04-30 11:21:25] jimevans: right now you have at least two
[2015-04-30 11:21:38] sevaseva, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2015-04-30 11:22:09] eindoofus_: the funny thing is it goes to the Dashboard Page and clicks on the submit button in Login Page fine
[2015-04-30 11:22:41] eindoofus_: commenting out "WebDriverWait" stops the error
[2015-04-30 11:22:43] cweng: what are the two ways that its accessing the driver instance?
[2015-04-30 11:23:27] eindoofus_: cweng, it enters through LoginPage and DashboardPage is never used. been trying to narrow it down
[2015-04-30 11:24:02] jimevans: cweng: you have a public instance variable in TestFixture named _driver. you also have the singleton Instance property of the Driver class
[2015-04-30 11:24:17] jimevans: both are publicly available to the test in question.
[2015-04-30 11:25:18] jimevans: and i've no idea if your TestFixture class is a base class of all of your tests (a common pattern) or not.
[2015-04-30 11:25:31] cweng: it is
[2015-04-30 11:25:31] eindoofus_: cweng, sorry. in my own world right now. disregard that last comment.
[2015-04-30 11:26:13] jimevans: cweng: so why does TestFixture implement IDisposable? does your test framework (xunit or ms test or whatever your using) support that?
[2015-04-30 11:26:31] jimevans: in other words, does the test runner explicitly call Dispose?
[2015-04-30 11:26:37] cweng: Xunit supports it
[2015-04-30 11:26:58] jimevans: dear $deity, how utterly idiotic.
[2015-04-30 11:28:12] jimevans: i mean every other .NET test runner in existence uses specific attributes and a well-defined life cycle for the test fixture class, and this one relies on the test fixture to implement IDisposable? talk about an antipattern.
[2015-04-30 11:28:31] jimevans: plus, there's no guarantee *when* .Dispose() will be called?
[2015-04-30 11:28:34] jimevans: ugh.
[2015-04-30 11:29:53] jimevans: sorry, cweng, not your fault or your problem
[2015-04-30 11:30:10] cweng: Well, it gives me insight, which I seriously need

[2015-04-30 11:31:46] jimevans: so if i were building the thing, i'd use NUnit, i'd create my driver instance in the [SetUp] method, and call .Quit() or .Dispose() in the [TearDown] method (if i wanted to have a new browser for every single test.
[2015-04-30 11:33:44] cweng: I was told it was difficult to set up parallel with nunit

[2015-04-30 11:46:54] cweng: so basically remove the driver class and create new driver in setup?
[2015-04-30 11:47:10] jimevans: i'd probably approach it that way, yes.
[2015-04-30 11:48:22] cweng: Any references you can recommend for figuring out how to parallel test using nunit?
[2015-04-30 11:49:32] Sourcerer, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-30 11:51:09] jimevans: fwiw, nunit 3.0 (in development, beta 1 released 25 March) fully supports parallelization.
[2015-04-30 11:51:45] gabecase: NUnit ftw
[2015-04-30 11:52:05] gabecase: I didnt have to do anything special for parallel testing using NUnit
[2015-04-30 11:53:56] jimevans: gabecase: how were you spawning test in parallel? using your own threading mechanism? and what version of nunit?
[2015-04-30 11:54:17] cweng: i was using threading
[2015-04-30 11:54:49] cweng: currently using 2.6.4
[2015-04-30 11:54:56] jimevans: cweng: those questions were for gabecase.
[2015-04-30 11:55:19] gabecase: I did parallelization through our CI server Bamboo basically
[2015-04-30 11:55:41] gabecase: each job was assigned a test suite but the test suites ran single threaded
[2015-04-30 11:55:46] gabecase: but were broken up
[2015-04-30 11:55:48] jimevans: gabecase: so you organized your tests into multiple assemblies, and parallel-tests the assemblies?
[2015-04-30 11:56:12] jimevans: oh, or you used test categories to slice up the tests.
[2015-04-30 11:56:18] gabecase: so each test suite was broken into 5-15 minute chunks and I scaled horizontally
[2015-04-30 11:56:31] gabecase: multiple executers per machine
[2015-04-30 11:56:42] gabecase: I wasn't using selenium grid
[2015-04-30 11:56:58] ericmeds, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-30 11:57:00] jimevans: gabecase: i guess i'm trying to get a handle on how the tests were broken up.
[2015-04-30 11:57:15] gabecase: logically in the code itself
[2015-04-30 11:57:31] gabecase: each test suite would be a file
[2015-04-30 11:57:32] jimevans: or rather, how the CI system knew to run tests A and B in one executor and C and D in parallel on another executor.
[2015-04-30 11:57:45] gabecase: via a queue
[2015-04-30 11:58:04] gabecase: I had downstream jobs that all got kicked off via a trigger upstream job
[2015-04-30 11:58:13] gabecase: downstream jobs = test suites
[2015-04-30 11:58:18] gabecase: all test suites got queued up
[2015-04-30 11:58:40] gabecase: multiple executers on each CI machine picked them up from the queue
[2015-04-30 11:58:51] gabecase: and started working on them in parallel
[2015-04-30 11:59:17] gabecase: but logically I had to plan for this, like eahc test suite needs to login in as seperate users etc... to prevent test from colliding with each other
[2015-04-30 11:59:19] jimevans: but the nunit test executor wasn't handling the parallelization itself.
[2015-04-30 11:59:20] gabecase: *each
[2015-04-30 11:59:42] gabecase: true jimevans we were leveraging CI for parallelization not the software itself
[2015-04-30 11:59:44] jimevans: you broke your tests up in such a way as to make them parallel external to nunit
[2015-04-30 12:00:06] gabecase: yes I wasnt' clear you guys were trying to do this thrugh NUnit directly
[2015-04-30 12:00:16] jimevans: gabecase: i'm not.
[2015-04-30 12:00:16] gabecase: reminds me of multitask in Rake

[2015-04-30 12:00:29] gabecase: correct
[2015-04-30 12:01:01] gabecase: sorry cweng im not familiar in that approach in .NET

[2015-04-30 12:13:47] MichaelB: So, I'm trying to get some HAR files using a browsermob proxy, and it works fine for most websites... The problem is that when I try to access the website I really want HARs for, I get "an unknown error occurred" response from the website when I'm using the browsermob proxy.
[2015-04-30 12:14:19] MichaelB: any ideas on why i might be getting an error for a website only when using a proxy?

[2015-04-30 13:12:56] jimevans: cweng: fwiw, nunit 3.0 looks like parallelization is pretty solid, and easily handled with attributes. in beta 1, only test fixtures (classes) are parallelizable; individual methods within a class aren't yet, but it's on the map for the full release.

[2015-04-30 14:17:02] dude-x: cweng: what i saw in the Java framework that i've worked with, every class had a private webdriver object, that the Spring framework would initialize with the global pretest driver
[2015-04-30 14:17:40] cweng: dude-x: what about the tests? all had a public Iwebdriver?
[2015-04-30 14:18:09] dude-x: well the reality was a bit more complicated... it wasn't a webdriver object, but a wrapper to webdriver
[2015-04-30 14:18:20] dude-x: but it was available for all tests to use to initialize the page objects

[2015-04-30 14:25:21] dude-x: it was actually private, because it doesn't matter outside of a test
