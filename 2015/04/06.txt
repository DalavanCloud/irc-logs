[2015-04-06 00:14:53] pikaren: why would u use explicit wait
[2015-04-06 00:15:08] pikaren: it makes the code so messy
[2015-04-06 00:15:11] pikaren: implicit wait all day

[2015-04-06 04:10:19] ato: Ardesco: It compiles just fine for me, try doing a clean build?
[2015-04-06 04:10:23] ato: Ardesco: `./go clean build`
[2015-04-06 04:10:34] Ardesco: i’ll give it a go
[2015-04-06 04:11:33] Ardesco: chug chug chug
[2015-04-06 04:11:34] Ardesco: :)
[2015-04-06 04:11:44] ato: It also compiles just fine on the CI and on Travis, so it's got to be something on your local system.
[2015-04-06 04:11:55] Ardesco: I’m sure it is
[2015-04-06 04:12:11] Ardesco: it’s just working out what i’m mising, or what I have that’s screwing things up
[2015-04-06 04:12:13] ato: It's odd though because the Closure compiler is in-tree.
[2015-04-06 04:12:23] ato: Make sure you haven't made any changes to any files?  (`git status`)
[2015-04-06 04:12:30] Ardesco: already done :)
[2015-04-06 04:12:53] Ardesco: could be I had something bad compiled previously and the clean will sort it out
[2015-04-06 04:13:37] Ardesco: this time i got go aborted!
[2015-04-06 04:13:38] Ardesco: Don't know how to build task '//cpp/iedriverserver:sizzle'
[2015-04-06 04:14:06] Ardesco: should I be running a different target for osx
[2015-04-06 04:14:26] Ardesco: I’m not going to be able to compile c++
[2015-04-06 04:16:57] Ardesco: or what do i need to install :)
[2015-04-06 04:17:18] ato: It will abort the targets it doesn't know/can compile.
[2015-04-06 04:17:26] ato: But it shouldn't abort the whole build.
[2015-04-06 04:17:38] ato: Can you paste the full output?

[2015-04-06 04:29:27] ato: My guess is that you have some libraries installed that makes it take a special path where it thinks it can compile something.

[2015-04-06 05:06:27] barancev: we use embedded jruby
[2015-04-06 05:06:50] barancev: Don't know how to build task '//cpp/iedriverserver:sizzle'
[2015-04-06 05:07:11] barancev: check the case if the subdir name
[2015-04-06 05:07:23] barancev: ./cpp/iedriverserver
[2015-04-06 05:07:32] barancev: it must be all loweracse
[2015-04-06 05:08:37] Ardesco: that’s it
[2015-04-06 05:08:41] Ardesco: it has uppercase
[2015-04-06 05:08:59] barancev: rename
[2015-04-06 05:09:05] Ardesco: just the directory names all lower case?
[2015-04-06 05:09:15] barancev: check other subdirs in cpp too
[2015-04-06 05:09:50] Ardesco: looking better :)
[2015-04-06 05:10:14] *Ardesco tries a full build'
[2015-04-06 05:10:16] barancev: jimevans decided to rename them once
[2015-04-06 05:10:24] barancev: but git sucks
[2015-04-06 05:11:36] Ardesco: would be nice it it gave you some better feedback, like can’t find directory or something
[2015-04-06 05:11:39] Ardesco: *if
[2015-04-06 05:11:44] Ardesco: but who am i kidding
[2015-04-06 05:11:58] Ardesco: all build tools are rubbish at feedback if you aren’t used to them
[2015-04-06 05:12:13] barancev: you know how to pull request, right? :)
[2015-04-06 05:12:39] *Ardesco submit pull reqest 666 Convert selenium build to Maven'
[2015-04-06 05:12:56] barancev: bwahaha!
[2015-04-06 05:13:17] Ardesco: i got really excited last year until i realised it was an April fools
[2015-04-06 05:13:17] barancev: to ant, it is more realistic
[2015-04-06 05:13:30] ato: Ah interesting.
[2015-04-06 05:13:37] Ardesco: the things i’ve seen in ant....
[2015-04-06 05:13:42] *Ardesco shudders'
[2015-04-06 05:13:42] ato: Mac by default uses a case insensitive file system.
[2015-04-06 05:13:46] ato: Is yours case sensitive?
[2015-04-06 05:13:56] Ardesco: I’ve not changed anything
[2015-04-06 05:14:05] Ardesco: that i’m aware of
[2015-04-06 05:14:10] barancev: ato: crazyfun is case sensitive
[2015-04-06 05:14:41] Ardesco: allworking
[2015-04-06 05:14:42] Ardesco: cheers
[2015-04-06 05:14:44] ato: Well then Ruby is actually wrong, because the file A and a should both exist on Mac.
[2015-04-06 05:14:50] Ardesco: I knew it would be something stupid
[2015-04-06 05:15:01] barancev: ato: crazyfun target is not a "file"
[2015-04-06 05:15:26] barancev: and it is case sensitrive
[2015-04-06 05:15:35] barancev: that can be improved of course
[2015-04-06 05:15:37] barancev: but...
[2015-04-06 05:15:57] barancev: renaming a dir is so easy...
[2015-04-06 05:16:06] Ardesco: where is selenium going with builds anyway
[2015-04-06 05:16:09] Ardesco: crazyfun
[2015-04-06 05:16:10] Ardesco: buck
[2015-04-06 05:16:17] Ardesco: vanilla rake?
[2015-04-06 05:16:21] barancev: buck
[2015-04-06 05:16:27] barancev: kick off jruby
[2015-04-06 05:16:53] Ardesco: not tempted by bazel?
[2015-04-06 05:16:54] Ardesco: :)
[2015-04-06 05:17:20] barancev: can it parallelize the build?
[2015-04-06 05:17:25] ato: The problem with both of them is that they don't support Windows.
[2015-04-06 05:17:54] Ardesco: pre-made docker build instance
[2015-04-06 05:17:59] ato: Whereas crazyfun sort of does.
[2015-04-06 05:18:02] Ardesco: just pull it and go?
[2015-04-06 05:18:12] barancev: yes, windows support is the only real showstopper for buck to be used instead of crazyfun
[2015-04-06 05:18:29] ato: Windows doesn't support LXC natively, so having to spin up VirutalBox to build Selenium is even crazier.
[2015-04-06 05:18:41] barancev: no docker, please :)
[2015-04-06 05:18:55] Ardesco: aww i’m really quite liking docker atm
[2015-04-06 05:19:00] trent, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-06 05:19:04] barancev: not for building purpose
[2015-04-06 05:19:09] ato: Docker really only makes sense on Linux.
[2015-04-06 05:19:16] Ardesco: need to spin up virtualbox for docker on osx as well
[2015-04-06 05:19:34] ato: Which is fine, it's great for deployment of server-side things.
[2015-04-06 05:19:41] barancev: docker is cool, even on windows, but having it a prerequisite to build selenium -- no, just no
[2015-04-06 05:19:42] Ardesco: isn’t MS next server os going to have built in docker support
[2015-04-06 05:20:04] aaronhumerickhou, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-06 05:20:04] ato: We need it to build on developer machines though.
[2015-04-06 05:20:04] Ardesco: i’m not suggesting it be a pre-requisite barancev
[2015-04-06 05:20:16] ato: But I'm in favour of checking in dependencies like we are now.
[2015-04-06 05:20:23] Ardesco: i’m suggesting having a ready made dev environment you could just pull down may be useful in some cases
[2015-04-06 05:20:29] ato: Building Selenium would be a lot more painful if we hadn't done that.
[2015-04-06 05:20:29] Ardesco: not specifically a selenium idea
[2015-04-06 05:20:31] barancev: there are ones
[2015-04-06 05:20:48] barancev: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium
[2015-04-06 05:21:37] Ardesco: goddammit selenium stop using the monitor i’m using irc in
[2015-04-06 05:21:44] ato: Nono, checking in dependencies is common practice in organisations with huge repositories who need reproducible builds.
[2015-04-06 05:22:00] Ardesco: checking in dependencies is sooo 90’s
[2015-04-06 05:22:14] Ardesco: what happened to local repository stores like nexus and artifactory
[2015-04-06 05:22:43] ato: Shared libraries and build dependency packages is so Linux-distro-y.
[2015-04-06 05:22:55] Ardesco: can’t think of anywhere i’ve worked in the past 10 years who actually checked libraries into source control
[2015-04-06 05:23:04] ato: Which doesn't quite scale on other OSes who don't have exactly the same package management structure.
[2015-04-06 05:23:21] barancev: I agree that there is no need to keep java deps in the repository, because maven
[2015-04-06 05:23:39] ato: Ardesco: Google, Facebook, Opera, Mozilla all do it so they can't be all wrong.
[2015-04-06 05:23:45] barancev: we can download them easily
[2015-04-06 05:23:59] barancev: and selenium's python and ruby deps are not store inside
[2015-04-06 05:24:06] barancev: not stored
[2015-04-06 05:24:19] ato: Right, there's a fine line towards what you store.
[2015-04-06 05:24:49] ato: Things like making sure the build system is self-contained and doesn't depend on having to install specific gems or pip packages though, makes sense.
[2015-04-06 05:24:54] Ardesco: to be fair, i’m very much based in the java world
[2015-04-06 05:25:01] ato: Because pip and gems suck quite badly.
[2015-04-06 05:25:01] Ardesco: so my view is approriatly biased

[2015-04-06 05:25:16] ato: You mean Maven world?
[2015-04-06 05:25:32] Ardesco: i find node dodgy as hell because people can republish stuff (although i think they are trying to stop that now)
[2015-04-06 05:25:36] barancev: pip + virtualenv -- what's wrong with this configuration?
[2015-04-06 05:25:53] Ardesco: well maven, gradle, etc
[2015-04-06 05:25:55] barancev: (that's what crazyfun deas for python)
[2015-04-06 05:26:00] barancev: *does
[2015-04-06 05:26:10] Ardesco: I think most of the technologies pull from central maven repos
[2015-04-06 05:26:10] ato: third_party in Selenium is actually quite nice, because you can check out the repo and don't have to worry about not having internet access.
[2015-04-06 05:26:11] ato: Which is a big thing if you decide to build Selenium in an internal build infrastructure where you can reproducible builds.
[2015-04-06 05:26:39] barancev: pip stores anything inside a virtualenv
[2015-04-06 05:26:52] barancev: so if you prepared the env you don't need to be online
[2015-04-06 05:27:27] barancev: and... for the Java part -- we depend on gecko :(
[2015-04-06 05:27:40] barancev: that is to downloaded :)
[2015-04-06 05:28:07] barancev: die, native events, die!

[2015-04-06 09:46:49] jleyba: meh, I've given up on 3.0
[2015-04-06 09:47:35] *ato shrugs'
[2015-04-06 09:48:33] ato: I feel changing the element string is more of a breaking change than removing a command we'd like to get rid of.
[2015-04-06 09:48:54] ato: Because the element string is used in several commands.
[2015-04-06 09:49:56] jimevans: w.r.t. the element serialization, the .NET bindings speak both dialects, as does the IE driver.
[2015-04-06 09:50:49] ato: So I don't particularly care what features goes into a release that breaks it, but from a user's perspective it seems unnatural to break in a point release because it would be not-quite-subtle breakage.
[2015-04-06 09:51:22] jimevans: ato: fwiw, that's simonstewart's preferred approach.
[2015-04-06 09:51:39] jimevans: (he and i disagree on this point)
[2015-04-06 09:51:43] ato: I was under the impression simonstewart's preferred approach was not to break it at all.
[2015-04-06 09:52:02] ato: But rather have a compatibility shim layer in the Selenium server.
[2015-04-06 09:52:18] jimevans: his approach is to publicize some (as yet undefined) release as "the last one to talk to 2.x server components"
[2015-04-06 09:52:52] jimevans: then remove the back compat bits
[2015-04-06 09:53:18] jimevans: in the meantime, there's some translation layer that handles translation both ways.
[2015-04-06 09:53:22] ato: How is that different from deprecating it like jleyba suggested, disregarding the version number.
[2015-04-06 09:53:33] jimevans: which, incidentally, will have to happen in all language bindings.
[2015-04-06 09:53:46] jimevans: ato: the difference is in version numbering
[2015-04-06 09:53:58] ato: Okay, that's not what I'm suggesting at all.
[2015-04-06 09:54:02] PartyGod, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-06 09:54:20] jimevans: i'd be fine with making the changeover happen at a major version number change. 2.x -> 3.0 or 3.x -> 4.0
[2015-04-06 09:54:35] jimevans: simonstewart insists that 3.x (to some value of
[2015-04-06 09:54:45] jleyba: lets please not wait for 4.0
[2015-04-06 09:54:46] jimevans: 'x') be able to continue to talk the
[2015-04-06 09:54:50] jleyba: that will be 5 years from now
[2015-04-06 09:54:52] jimevans: original protocol dialect
[2015-04-06 09:54:57] ato: Just release it.
[2015-04-06 09:55:25] jimevans: which, again, i disagree with.
[2015-04-06 09:55:47] jimevans: and, jleyba, that's also one of the reasons for my recent extreme disillusionment.
[2015-04-06 09:56:33] ato: If we can't reach consensus on this–in part because of lack of decisions–we just make it clear in the changelog that something's deprecated as of next release and make the transition in the subsequent release.
[2015-04-06 09:58:07] ato: I'm saying it would be nice to do a clean break on a major version increment, but 3.0 seems to have become so politicised by this point and no one seems to quite know what it is, that I'm happy to settle for the next best thing.

[2015-04-06 10:06:31] ato: Well, I didn't say anything about exposing the check of whether an element is interactable or not.
[2015-04-06 10:06:36] ato: I haven't given that any thought.
[2015-04-06 10:07:10] ato: But I do think that the current definition in the spec of interactibility is completely wrong, as barancev pointed out in his spec bug.
[2015-04-06 10:07:30] ato: But that may be because no one has seriously looked at that part of the spec.
[2015-04-06 10:07:53] barancev: it is legacy wording
[2015-04-06 10:07:57] ato: Yeah.
[2015-04-06 10:08:27] ato: Interactibility implies element displayedness, which isn't what the WG intended to say.
[2015-04-06 10:09:51] jimevans: i think what people are really interested in, is "canBeMadeToBeClickableOrSendKeysable"

[2015-04-06 10:10:21] barancev: exactly
[2015-04-06 10:10:29] jleyba: so they can click it outside a normal user flow?
[2015-04-06 10:10:48] jimevans: jleyba: er, no.

[2015-04-06 14:29:28] dmarr: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/element/:id/value
[2015-04-06 14:29:29] cassie_f: yep we have an "enter_text" function which is basically a field.clear and field.send_keys(text)
[2015-04-06 14:31:24] jleyba: dmarr, that's not a setValue
[2015-04-06 14:31:29] Titus: lukeis: yes, I'm willing to help out in that capacity
[2015-04-06 14:31:56] dmarr: jleyba: yeah sorry its from the wrapper lib i'm using: http://nightwatchjs.org/api/setValue.html
[2015-04-06 14:32:00] jleyba: that translates to send key strokes. so if you want to clear the form element, the simplest is to send Ctrl+A prior to the replacement value
[2015-04-06 14:32:38] lukeis: Titus: cool… we'll likely want to ask jarib if he thinks you're a good candidate and for you to get some keys to do that :)
