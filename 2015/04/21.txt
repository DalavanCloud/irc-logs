[2015-04-21 04:26:46] referup: hi all. I have Selenium 1/RC tests and want to setup a Se Grid. Followed official seleniumhq wiki page. Ran java -jar selenium-...-2.45.0.jar -role hub and also "-node rc". Both on localhost and link OK betweend them. However I get a 500 error that I googled but no clue (none of responses applies to me). First, I would like to know: is setting a Se1 Grid the same than a Se2 Grid? Official docs link to non-working http://selenium-grid
[2015-04-21 04:28:52] referup: also: the same grid runs Se2 tests fine.

[2015-04-21 05:30:44] alko: hello world? i was here a bit ago after doing some work refactoring the selenium grid into something that is easy to work on, but it got nixed
[2015-04-21 05:30:53] fabrice31, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-21 05:31:10] alko: dimacus suggested that i come back and discuss the realities with the powers that be
[2015-04-21 05:31:23] davehunt, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-04-21 05:32:00] alko: i built up a selenium grid with over 100 nodes running windows 7, windows 8, and mac os x
[2015-04-21 05:32:14] alko: and then a second grid as a failover with dimacus in the us
[2015-04-21 05:32:37] alko: and we built an automated monitoring and management system to keep it running and alert us to problems
[2015-04-21 05:33:01] alko: doing this we were able to support running lots of automated tests in parallel on multiple browsers at the same time
[2015-04-21 05:33:11] alko: to get good results with continuous integration
[2015-04-21 05:33:24] alko: we tried saucelabs and found it was so slow it was completely unusable
[2015-04-21 05:33:48] CodeItClean, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-21 05:33:54] alko: the interesting thing i find is that every one i meet tells me the selenium grid is unusable, but we really had good success with it
[2015-04-21 05:34:00] alko: so i find that odd
[2015-04-21 05:34:38] alko: there are obviously problems, and i always wanted to get into the code, but found the way the project was structured to be very difficult to work with; all of the selenium components are in one massive repo
[2015-04-21 05:35:04] alko: when all i want are the grid classes, and the rest comes from nexus
[2015-04-21 05:35:31] alko: unlike every other project i've ever wanted to work on, i couldn't just import a pom into my IDE and then start debugging it
[2015-04-21 05:36:00] alko: now that i had some time, i pulled out the grid code and broke it into separate maven modules
[2015-04-21 05:36:26] DarkRift, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-21 05:36:35] alko: so it is now very easy to debug and code, and i don't need to download tons and tons of source code i don't need to work on it
[2015-04-21 05:36:57] alko: however this is a very different approach to the monolithic code base currently in use
[2015-04-21 05:38:02] alko: i then built a client to monitor the traffic going through the hub, and ran some test simulations to determine that the nodes for some reason just stop working at some point
[2015-04-21 05:38:20] wdj, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)

[2015-04-21 05:38:47] wdj, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-21 05:39:04] alko: i am wondering if this is the reason many people find the grid unusable? we handled this by simply restarting the nodes on a regular basis, but it would be nice to find a solutin

[2015-04-21 05:39:54] alko: anyhow, i believe that being able to run a large, performant grid is essential to any serious continuous integration work using selenium webdriver tests (especially when you want to run the tests on multiple browsers)

[2015-04-21 05:42:18] alko: and i should have some time to take a look into that and various other problems with the grid in the next couple months
[2015-04-21 05:42:36] alko: i can merge all my changes back into the main repo, as they are structural, but that is kind of a pain
[2015-04-21 05:42:58] alko: so i will probably work with multiple repos for now and setup my own nexus for now
[2015-04-21 05:43:09] alko: but it would be nice to keep in synch with you all
[2015-04-21 05:43:17] wdj, quitting. (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[2015-04-21 05:43:39] alko: so maybe we can find some sort of happy solution at the end...and with that, i return to coding for now :)

Firefox opens up with some abritrary settings, not the ones I pushed through. Here's my simple code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/634e7554310a919139c7

[2015-04-21 09:38:48] _sillymarkets: Do you know if it would be like a corporate firewall blocking it? but when I manually change my firefox settings, and open a new browser window, it retains my configured settings. When I run the selenium script, and re-open a browser window manually, the settings are changed to some random default
[2015-04-21 09:39:41] WhereIsMySpoon: the settings set automatically inside a selenium session wont be saved over your normal firefox settings

[2015-04-21 12:52:15] lukeis: jleyba: it also assumes you're running on the same machine as the test runner… so, we'd have to make "enhancements" to run it on saucelabs somehow?

[2015-04-21 13:06:50] jleyba: eindoofus, authentication depends on your stack.  teams here grab an authentication cookie directly from the backend and set it via WebDriver
[2015-04-21 13:07:05] jleyba: so tests don't need to mess with a login page
[2015-04-21 13:07:44] barancev: IE does not conform to the good sense

[2015-04-21 13:08:03] jleyba: eindoofus: creating test data...suppose you're testing messages in Gmail. You shouldn't have test user A send a message to B, then login as B and verify it shows up in the inbox
[2015-04-21 13:08:30] jleyba: instead, just manipulate the backend directly for user B, load the inbox and check the UI did its thing

[2015-04-21 14:05:33] kyoob: junit 4 can run parameterized tests as well: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19203730/writing-java-tests-with-data-providers

[2015-04-21 14:18:57] eindoofus: they're set on using junit4 for this project so don't really have those options, but good to know either way
[2015-04-21 14:20:07] kyoob: in that case look into ingesting data from spreadsheets and parameterizing your tests with the results of that.
[2015-04-21 14:20:12] kyoob: business folk love spreadsheets
[2015-04-21 14:20:30] eindoofus: lol. very true
[2015-04-21 14:21:16] eindoofus: hoping to do something more dynamic that accesses our data api directly, just don't know how to structure it
