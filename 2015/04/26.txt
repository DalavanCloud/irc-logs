[2015-04-26 05:48:35] lavish: hi all, I'm using python-selenium 2.42 with phantomjs-1.9.8 (gentoo stable packages).  There's a crazy thing happening here... If I set the UA to something like 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11) KHTML/4.9.1 (like Gecko) Konqueror/4.9' by doing DesiredCapabilities.PHANTOMJS['phantomjs.page.settings.userAgent'] = '<my user agent>', the application collapses in the following way http://pastebin.com/iUsYYgjd

[2015-04-26 10:20:34] dude-x_: you connect to the hub in your tests

[2015-04-26 10:20:47] mekhami: that's what i thought. what am i thinking
[2015-04-26 10:20:50] dude-x_: you have to specify the right browser
[2015-04-26 10:20:56] dude-x_: the hub will then connect to the right node
[2015-04-26 10:21:17] dude-x_: so if machine A is FF and machine B is Chrome, your test just has to specify Chrome and the hub will connect to machine B
