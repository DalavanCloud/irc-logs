[2015-04-03 08:30:36] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: but I am not sure how a CLA covers us
[2015-04-03 08:30:46] nirvdrum: We own the copyright then.
[2015-04-03 08:31:06] AutomatedTester: Mozilla only asks for a CLA if we give a person commit access
[2015-04-03 08:31:09] nirvdrum: Covers is a bit strong.  But it allows us to relicense if that ever were something to look into.
[2015-04-03 08:31:43] AutomatedTester: fair enough
[2015-04-03 08:31:57] nirvdrum: I wanted to change a library that was made GPL once.  And without a CLA I needed to track down every single committer to get assent or remove their contributions and rewrite.
[2015-04-03 08:32:41] nirvdrum: You could be in weird territory where a contributor commits stuff his/her employer actually owns.  The CLA in theory shields you a bit from that.
[2015-04-03 08:33:14] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I would have thought our legal team wouldnt leave us open for litigation
[2015-04-03 08:33:31] nirvdrum: The beauty of open source licensing and such is no one has a clue.
[2015-04-03 08:33:44] AutomatedTester: \o/
[2015-04-03 08:33:45] nirvdrum: Apache requires one for that reason, FYI.
[2015-04-03 08:33:51] AutomatedTester: ok
[2015-04-03 08:34:04] nirvdrum: And then the ASF provides indemnity to each project that complies with the policy.
[2015-04-03 08:34:22] nirvdrum: ASLv2 also guards against submarine patent BS.

[2015-04-03 08:34:47] AutomatedTester: right... I need to get back to my public holiday
[2015-04-03 08:34:50] AutomatedTester: laters
[2015-04-03 08:34:51] nirvdrum: That's a fun case where I contribute code and let you own the copyright, but the code uses something I own a patent on and then I start extorting people.

[2015-04-03 14:37:35] ato: barancev: I'm here, but it's a holiday in Europe today.
[2015-04-03 14:38:05] barancev: ato: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=7405 -- do you really think this is a valid issue?
[2015-04-03 14:38:46] ato: I think it's might be a real issue, but I don't think we have the power to fix it.
[2015-04-03 14:39:42] ato: At least in X the call to maximise a window isn't blocking or doesn't offer any callback so the caller can block.
[2015-04-03 14:40:12] ato: It's by design meant to be asynchronous, and whatever the WM does of fancy effects isn't X's concern.
[2015-04-03 14:40:57] barancev: so it is not a Selenium issue :)
[2015-04-03 14:41:08] ato: Basically we can't tell what crazy stuff the WM is doing.
[2015-04-03 14:41:14] barancev: right
[2015-04-03 14:41:20] ato: Yeah, I lean towards “out of scope”.
[2015-04-03 14:41:26] barancev: ok
[2015-04-03 14:41:49] ato: Like if you run in an X virtual framebuffer, this shouldn't be an issue.
[2015-04-03 14:42:07] ato: That's my take on it (-:
[2015-04-03 14:42:18] barancev: it depends on the browser too
[2015-04-03 14:42:26] barancev: not X-server only
[2015-04-03 14:42:37] barancev: or WM
[2015-04-03 14:45:12] ato: True.
[2015-04-03 14:45:22] ato: Firefox does this crazy slow animation when you move into fullscreen.
[2015-04-03 14:45:32] ato: But at least that's under our control.

[2015-04-03 17:24:18] ngc0202: and it automates some task for a bit then I want it to, once it's finished, just hold and only quit when the browser is manually closed
[2015-04-03 17:24:20] ngc0202: How can I do this?
[2015-04-03 17:25:30] ngc0202: Well actually preferably I guess it'd kill the webdriver and end the program, but leave the browser open

[2015-04-03 17:48:55] ato: ngc0202: At the last question: No that's not possible because the driver is the parent of the browser.
[2015-04-03 17:49:11] ngc0202: okay
[2015-04-03 17:49:32] ato: ngc0202: But I'd suggest blocking until the browser quits.
[2015-04-03 17:49:40] ngc0202: I have no idea how to do that
[2015-04-03 17:49:56] ngc0202: I was reading all about the waits and stuff but all I could find was stuff on how to wait for things to load
[2015-04-03 17:50:02] ato: It's not entirely straight forward.
[2015-04-03 17:50:26] ngc0202: What I've been doing is just Ctrl-C'ing the Java process once it finished
[2015-04-03 17:50:37] ngc0202: It would keep the browser open
[2015-04-03 17:50:55] ngc0202: But then I realized I had about 50 chromedriver.exe's open
[2015-04-03 17:52:16] ato: You'd probably need to send some regular pings to the driver to not have it time out.
[2015-04-03 17:53:08] ato: But generally you just leave it, then ignore the error it sends back on the last poll and do a check on that, which would tell you that the driver has lost connection to the browser.
[2015-04-03 17:54:01] ngc0202: ok
[2015-04-03 17:54:31] ato: You probably want your program to block for a kqueue/epoll event.
[2015-04-03 17:58:38] ngc0202: Can I change the connection timeout?
[2015-04-03 17:59:41] ngc0202: Like so it doesn't wait 5 minutes before it realizes something's wrong
[2015-04-03 18:03:11] ato: Probably.
[2015-04-03 18:03:19] ato: It's not uniform, so you'll have to read the soruce.
[2015-04-03 18:03:21] ato: source.
