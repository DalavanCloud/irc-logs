[2015-05-22 03:38:48] WhereIsMySpoon: ^_^
[2015-05-22 03:42:09] johnner: does the beta form of Marionette assist also with Firefox 38 issues and above? And is a version of Selenium being updated for the Developer Version of Firefox, as I believe that edition plays nicer with tools like Selenium?  thx
[2015-05-22 03:45:23] davehunt, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2015-05-22 03:47:44] barancev: johnner: 1) no, 2) no, 3) no
[2015-05-22 03:47:55] barancev: marionette is not production ready yet
[2015-05-22 03:49:05] johnner: thx
[2015-05-22 03:49:57] barancev: and it requires nightly, not the developer edition
[2015-05-22 03:51:23] johnner: reason I brought up marionette was - a beta version was hinted in the change log files for 2.46; so even with 2.46 - firefox going forward will still be either broken?   And any hints of 3.0.0
[2015-05-22 03:52:10] barancev: a beta version, you read it correct :)
[2015-05-22 03:52:36] johnner: what is nightly, another rev of FF, or are you saying the nightly builds of firefox (beta) allow backdoor access to the browser still.... again thx
[2015-05-22 03:52:53] barancev: yes, nightly firefox builds
[2015-05-22 03:53:19] barancev: there are 4 firefox channels: stable, beta, dev, nightly
[2015-05-22 03:53:45] barancev: sltable releases are shipped every 6 weeks
[2015-05-22 03:53:53] barancev: nightly is, well, nightly
[2015-05-22 03:55:02] barancev: marionettedriver requires the features that are available in nightly only at the moment

[2015-05-22 08:18:22] pagenoare: oh
[2015-05-22 08:18:31] marmotworks: you could prolly use something along with it in your suite
[2015-05-22 08:18:37] marmotworks: but selenium is not going to do that
[2015-05-22 08:18:59] marmotworks: redirects, or just navigation?
[2015-05-22 08:19:00] dude-x: use requests library and set "do not follow"
[2015-05-22 08:19:06] pagenoare: i was using pure phantomjs
[2015-05-22 08:19:27] pagenoare: but it failed because it didnt support cookies I think

[2015-05-22 08:20:20] marmotworks: cheers
[2015-05-22 08:20:29] marmotworks: Yeah I don't have a good answer for that
[2015-05-22 08:20:42] dude-x: you would have to execute some javascript to interfere with that
[2015-05-22 08:21:45] pagenoare: selenium works just fine. it renders the final page as expected, the thing is to log the urls in between
[2015-05-22 08:22:14] pagenoare: have somebody tried scrappy for that kind of stuff?
[2015-05-22 08:22:26] pagenoare: or it won't either
[2015-05-22 08:22:43] pagenoare: scrapy*
[2015-05-22 08:22:53] dude-x: my guess a proxy server can record all that
[2015-05-22 08:22:55] dude-x: without effor
[2015-05-22 08:23:05] D3M0S: pagenoare, possibly try an Event Firing WebDriver
[2015-05-22 08:23:10] dude-x: other than the effort of setting up a proxy server
[2015-05-22 08:23:18] dude-x: no event firing webdriver doesn't make sense in this case.
[2015-05-22 08:23:33] pagenoare: dude-x, hm. so setup a proxy for logging all requests, and hit selenium to use that proxy server?
[2015-05-22 08:23:37] pagenoare: am I thinking right?
[2015-05-22 08:23:41] dude-x: yes
[2015-05-22 08:23:45] pagenoare: makes sense
[2015-05-22 08:23:46] dude-x: the browser will use that proxy
[2015-05-22 08:23:49] pagenoare: yeah
[2015-05-22 08:23:54] D3M0S: yeah, well you could possibly get it to log the driver.getCurrentUrl() on like every navigation to see if it matches to where you expected to be
[2015-05-22 08:24:05] pagenoare: that makes perfect sense to me.
[2015-05-22 08:24:19] pagenoare: D3M0S, I was thinking about it, but the docs kinda sucks :s
[2015-05-22 08:24:26] pagenoare: and couldn't dig into that parts of code
[2015-05-22 08:24:47] D3M0S: pagenoare, does your framework restrict the set-up of your webdriver?
[2015-05-22 08:25:14] pagenoare: D3M0S, no. but i want it to work without X-server
[2015-05-22 08:25:30] pagenoare: so all "normal" browser's drivers are not an option
[2015-05-22 08:25:30] D3M0S: Event Firing doesn't require x-server
[2015-05-22 08:26:01] D3M0S: EventFiringWebDriver efwd = new EventFiringWebDriver(driver); where driver = your phantomjs driver
[2015-05-22 08:26:04] D3M0S: it's a wrapper
[2015-05-22 08:26:10] pagenoare: dude-x, thanks for the idea.
[2015-05-22 08:26:15] D3M0S: efwd.addListener(MyListener) I think
[2015-05-22 08:26:20] pagenoare: D3M0S, yeah.. Im using python:P
[2015-05-22 08:26:30] D3M0S: it's just syntax
[2015-05-22 08:26:36] pagenoare: sure
[2015-05-22 08:26:41] pagenoare: checking the names in the code. thanks
[2015-05-22 08:26:50] D3M0S: I'm just showing that you essentially wrap your phantom js driver with the EFWD, then add a litener to the efwdDriver
[2015-05-22 08:26:53] dude-x: event firing webdriver has listeners?
[2015-05-22 08:27:03] D3M0S: dude-x, yeah...that's like the core part of them
[2015-05-22 08:27:17] dude-x: i always seen it more like a trigger based on actions
[2015-05-22 08:27:27] dude-x: but that's make it even more interesting
[2015-05-22 08:27:45] dude-x: I can do some clever error handling...
[2015-05-22 08:28:07] pagenoare: ;)
[2015-05-22 08:28:24] barancev: jimevans: FYI: CI is green
[2015-05-22 08:28:34] jimevans: noticed that earlier.
[2015-05-22 08:28:46] dude-x: when i last looked at the event firing webdriver api, it just seems that you can define things like before events and after eventes for certain webdriver calls
[2015-05-22 08:28:56] jimevans: barancev: mad props to lukeis for following up with sauce on the root cause and getting it fixed.
[2015-05-22 08:29:01] pagenoare: from selenium.webdriver.support.events import EventFiringWebDriver
[2015-05-22 08:29:05] pagenoare: found it:-)
[2015-05-22 08:29:12] dude-x: which is different than having something poll based on a "event" from a webpage.
[2015-05-22 08:29:21] pagenoare: D3M0S, gonna test it in a few. thanks a lot!!
[2015-05-22 08:29:38] pagenoare: https://gist.github.com/billagee/080e21842bafb8b22586
[2015-05-22 08:29:54] D3M0S: pagenoare, it's much easier than implmenting a proxy, but wont be as versatile.  I still really like a proxy as a solution, but efwd would be a very quick and dirty fix if it works
[2015-05-22 08:30:05] barancev: I think about delisting htmlunitdriver from seleniumserver at all
[2015-05-22 08:30:38] pagenoare: D3M0S, yeah. i've emailed my boss about proxy solution. not sure if we've resources for it:)
[2015-05-22 08:30:46] pagenoare: D3M0S, i like it too:)

[2015-05-22 08:31:08] D3M0S: pagenoare, you can do loads of really cool stuff with proxies.  you might want to look into littleproxy
[2015-05-22 08:31:31] Cache_Money, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-22 08:31:39] pagenoare: will do, cheers
[2015-05-22 08:32:52] D3M0S: pagenoare, littleproxy allows you to spin up a proxy server for each webdriver thread and then attach the proxy to each webdriver for that proxy server and then you can monitor and modify the proxy server along with your webdriver...which brings loads of utility to your webdriver.
[2015-05-22 08:33:58] D3M0S: ofc, you might need to find the python counterpart

[2015-05-22 08:38:54] lukeis: i think i still need to adjust our build so that we're basically only including native events for two versions nowâ€¦ 31esr and 33

[2015-05-22 08:39:55] pagenoare: D3M0S, many thanks
[2015-05-22 08:40:11] barancev: who cares about 31 and 33
[2015-05-22 08:40:12] pagenoare: D3M0S, we'll probably switch to the proxy later
[2015-05-22 08:40:44] lukeis: barancev: oddly enough, I care about 31â€¦ but i don't care about native events at all
[2015-05-22 08:41:40] lukeis: how we're using Firefox proxy with RC is broken in Firefox 34+ â€¦ so we're pegging our RC tests to 31esr.

[2015-05-22 08:45:00] lukeis: it's about time to get Selenium 3.0 going (and then you can delete it)
[2015-05-22 08:45:49] D3M0S: is there a selenium 3 source I can help with?  I want to dive in and start contributing and I think selenium 3 is a good place to start.

[2015-05-22 08:47:13] lukeis: and the source is all in master
[2015-05-22 08:47:38] lukeis: fixing any issue with WebDriver would be a good place to start :)
[2015-05-22 08:47:55] D3M0S: so just pick a bug and tackle it?

[2015-05-22 09:48:08] pagenoare: D3M0S, this solution with event firing driver doesnt seem to work well after all
[2015-05-22 09:48:17] pagenoare: D3M0S, it catches only first redirection :(
[2015-05-22 09:48:25] pagenoare: D3M0S, gonna go with proxies. thanks
[2015-05-22 09:48:31] D3M0S: pagenoare, there are multiple redirections?
[2015-05-22 09:48:41] pagenoare: yeah
[2015-05-22 09:48:46] davehunt: lukeis: any idea what format the timestamp from the logs is?
[2015-05-22 09:48:52] D3M0S: pagenoare, and...do all of them matter or only the last one?
[2015-05-22 09:49:01] pagenoare: D3M0S, i want to log them all
[2015-05-22 09:49:09] pagenoare: just the url
[2015-05-22 09:49:16] pagenoare: no need for source, or any other info
[2015-05-22 09:49:41] pagenoare: brb
[2015-05-22 09:49:59] D3M0S: pagenoare, yeah, I'm not sure if it will be able to do that...maybe if you polled every 100 ms and logged the url for like 4 seconds..but that would be pretty bad way to handle it
[2015-05-22 09:50:15] davehunt: I assumed unix timestamp, but we're not in the year 47358
[2015-05-22 09:50:50] D3M0S: Padawan, you still around?
[2015-05-22 09:51:05] Padawan: Sure
[2015-05-22 09:51:12] davehunt: ah, maybe unix time but in millis
[2015-05-22 09:51:16] D3M0S: Padawan, the way I usually handle it is to pass in an argument with the run
[2015-05-22 09:51:24] D3M0S: so like -Dbrowser=firefox
[2015-05-22 09:51:29] D3M0S: or -Dbrowser=chrome
[2015-05-22 09:51:37] Padawan: D3M0S: But with the selenium server right?
[2015-05-22 09:51:51] D3M0S: then you react to that system property in order to build out the correct webdriver and return it
[2015-05-22 09:52:27] Padawan: I mean, can we do cross browser test without the remote webdriver?
[2015-05-22 09:52:39] Padawan: i see
[2015-05-22 09:52:42] D3M0S: you dont need the remote webdriver in this instance...no

[2015-05-22 09:59:33] D3M0S: so yeah, pseudo code would look like this

[2015-05-22 10:02:51] D3M0S: Padawan, so however you can pass in runtime arguments with python, just pass in one of those...and then do like a switch or a few if statements on that property
[2015-05-22 10:03:44] Padawan: oh, i think i got it
[2015-05-22 10:04:20] D3M0S: Padawan, cool, sorry I'm not more help with Python
[2015-05-22 10:06:46] Padawan: D3M0S: hey man, thanks a lot. All i was looking was some guidance, and you did that. I really appreciated.
[2015-05-22 10:07:02] D3M0S: Padawan, no worries, anytime.
[2015-05-22 10:08:22] D3M0S: doing it this way makes it really nice for CI, because you can schedule one test run with the firefox switch and then do a 2nd test run with the chrome switch, so you get separated results for each browser
