[2015-05-28 00:12:45] arex\work: We have created a smoke test for our web application using Selenium WebDriver. It is a very flaky test, because the grid hub, grid node or browser tend to crash. Is this normal? Should I build in "retry this test x times"? Should I look to use other technologies for my smoke testing?
