[2015-05-20 03:45:17] p0deje: since it now only happens for firefox (and this pull request extends it to chrome)
[2015-05-20 03:46:10] p0deje: if this is done, it should be applied to other bindings as well, so Jari suggested to discuss it here first

[2015-05-20 04:27:42] p0deje: so there is a chance port is free at the moment it’s checked, but take at the moment chromedriver is started
[2015-05-20 04:28:42] p0deje: pull request solves it by forcing chromedriver to be started one-by-one

[2015-05-20 07:43:18] lukeis: the next release will be when we get our act together :)  yesterday we finally identified the saucelabs issue… they are running java 6. so apparently the next release will require java 7 (we'll put a big note in the readme :) ). This has been discussed in the past that we would drop java 6, but the day has finally come.
[2015-05-20 07:43:57] barancev: or we rebuild htmlunit
[2015-05-20 07:44:01] lukeis: no ;)
[2015-05-20 07:44:04] barancev: or drop it :)
[2015-05-20 07:44:08] lukeis: no ;)
[2015-05-20 07:45:01] lukeis: so, what's going on with their windows? seems like they are already running java 7?
[2015-05-20 07:45:15] barancev: yes
[2015-05-20 07:45:38] barancev: only linux boxes are subject to this issue
[2015-05-20 07:46:09] AutomatedTester: hasnt Java 7 been EOL?
[2015-05-20 07:46:18] lukeis: yes ;)
[2015-05-20 07:46:41] lukeis: April 2015
[2015-05-20 07:47:20] lukeis: we here have only recently switched our application to java 8
[2015-05-20 07:47:45] AutomatedTester: what is wrong with Java folk?
[2015-05-20 07:47:56] lukeis: what's wrong with python folk?
[2015-05-20 07:48:11] lukeis: so many people still run 2! :-D
[2015-05-20 07:48:14] AutomatedTester: python 2.7 is supported till 2020
[2015-05-20 07:48:24] lukeis: well, that's just silly ;)
[2015-05-20 07:48:43] barancev: what? 2020?
[2015-05-20 07:48:54] AutomatedTester: Guido said 2020
[2015-05-20 07:49:28] lukeis: dates too far off means people will not be motivated to migrate until it's 2020
[2015-05-20 07:51:50] lukeis: java 7 EOL was very aggressive compared to the EOL of 6 :)
[2015-05-20 07:52:52] lukeis: the problem with java nowadays is it's owned by oracle! ;)   (and that when they've released a new major release, it's always had major issues with backwards compatibility)
[2015-05-20 07:57:34] barancev: lukeis: if we target Java 7 I'd suggest to change compiler settings in the project
[2015-05-20 07:57:42] barancev: to enforce migration
[2015-05-20 07:57:47] lukeis: sounds good :)
[2015-05-20 07:58:08] barancev: but first we have to make a decision

[2015-05-20 09:03:16] lukeis: mekhami: i call it Jenkins :)
[2015-05-20 09:03:16] gabecase, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-05-20 09:03:28] sircapsalot: definitely feasible
[2015-05-20 09:03:40] mekhami: heh lukeis they definitely have a jenkins thing set up, but can someone run a single test class on demand that way? i haven't used jenkins personally
[2015-05-20 09:03:50] mekhami: or a set of test classes
[2015-05-20 09:03:53] gabecase, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-20 09:03:56] sircapsalot: yea you can -
[2015-05-20 09:03:57] lukeis: yes, you can easily configure a job to take parameters
[2015-05-20 09:04:08] lukeis: one parameter being the test class ;)
[2015-05-20 09:04:10] sircapsalot: have a custom testrunner, where you can pass something like com.company.myapp.tests.MyTest
[2015-05-20 09:04:17] sircapsalot: then your test runner will reflect and find all test methods
[2015-05-20 09:04:25] mekhami: is this something that a QA person can do without touching code or command lines?
[2015-05-20 09:04:30] mekhami: I'm having to cater to the bottom of the barrel
[2015-05-20 09:04:35] lukeis: once you've set it up for them, yes
[2015-05-20 09:04:37] sircapsalot: a QA person can do, yes.. if they are a "developer" ;)
[2015-05-20 09:04:37] angliscCzilla, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2015-05-20 09:04:42] sircapsalot: to implement it anyway
[2015-05-20 09:05:00] mekhami: I (and my team) can implement it, just need to make sure its easy for a non-dev to use

[2015-05-20 09:18:36] D3M0S: mekhami, in my experience, this type of thing is what makes you an SDET over just a Software Developer...
[2015-05-20 09:18:52] mekhami: D3M0S not familiar with the acronym
[2015-05-20 09:19:02] D3M0S: mekhami, Software Developer in Test
[2015-05-20 09:19:17] D3M0S: mekhami, technically Software Development Engineer in Test
[2015-05-20 09:19:42] mekhami: i guess i don't understand what your'e saying haha
[2015-05-20 09:19:48] D3M0S: the hardest part is making your code stupid simple to cater to the lowest common denominator

[2015-05-20 09:21:21] WhereIsMySpoon: mekhami: i dont see why you couldnt just set up a bunch of jenkins jobs that are for the different classes you have or packages and set permissions on them for your testers
[2015-05-20 09:21:29] D3M0S: anybody can be a Software Engineer and make difficult code, that only other Software Engineers can use.  But it's basically in the SDET job description to code exentesibility to a workforce that generally has a very low understanding of coding
[2015-05-20 09:21:31] WhereIsMySpoon: then they can just press build and report on the results
[2015-05-20 09:21:46] WhereIsMySpoon: though i dont know why you need people to do that..
[2015-05-20 09:21:50] sohlemac, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-20 09:21:54] WhereIsMySpoon: you can automate build and report generation/analysis
[2015-05-20 09:22:11] WhereIsMySpoon: mekhami: what are these people doing that you're catering to?
[2015-05-20 09:22:13] mekhami: WhereIsMySpoon because the company has to justify salaries =P
[2015-05-20 09:22:22] mekhami: WhereIsMySpoon way above my pay grade to even answer that question
[2015-05-20 09:22:34] WhereIsMySpoon: mekhami: you dont know waht they do on a day to day basis?
[2015-05-20 09:22:54] D3M0S: mekhami, what I recommend is coding the thing so it works, then abstracting it out to be very simple...so it can be understood by a 2 semester java student
[2015-05-20 09:22:56] mekhami: WhereIsMySpoon I will soon, but my consulting contract with them doesn't start till (probably) next week
[2015-05-20 09:23:01] WhereIsMySpoon: mekhami: I see
[2015-05-20 09:23:20] mekhami: D3M0S it's not about the code though, just about providng access to tests for non developers
[2015-05-20 09:23:34] WhereIsMySpoon: thats easily possible with jenkins
[2015-05-20 09:23:42] WhereIsMySpoon: and a few parameters to your test runner
[2015-05-20 09:23:43] D3M0S: mekhami, which language?
[2015-05-20 09:23:44] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2015-05-20 09:23:48] mekhami: WhereIsMySpoon it's entirely likely that MY job for this company is going to be to make THEIR job irrelevant
[2015-05-20 09:23:54] WhereIsMySpoon: hahahhaa
[2015-05-20 09:24:15] WhereIsMySpoon: in that case why bother with this dumbing down
[2015-05-20 09:24:30] D3M0S: mekhami,  another thing you could use is something like JBehave or a BDD framework
[2015-05-20 09:24:31] mekhami: because it's probably an iterative step to that end.
[2015-05-20 09:24:32] WhereIsMySpoon: make it complex but make it output readable results and completely automated
[2015-05-20 09:24:57] WhereIsMySpoon: that way the dumb testers wont be able to do anything apart from print off a report and hand it to a manager
[2015-05-20 09:25:05] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-05-20 09:25:26] D3M0S: WhereIsMySpoon, I don't see it that way, I think you should be lifting the people around you up, not shutting them out of a job
[2015-05-20 09:25:35] WhereIsMySpoon: it was partly a joke :)
[2015-05-20 09:25:43] D3M0S: WhereIsMySpoon, ah ok
[2015-05-20 09:25:46] WhereIsMySpoon: but see where he said consulting job
[2015-05-20 09:25:58] D3M0S: WhereIsMySpoon, consult them to get better testers!
[2015-05-20 09:25:58] WhereIsMySpoon: he isnt part of this company
[2015-05-20 09:26:00] D3M0S: jk
[2015-05-20 09:26:01] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2015-05-20 09:26:04] WhereIsMySpoon: no jk
[2015-05-20 09:26:06] WhereIsMySpoon: for real
[2015-05-20 09:26:06] mekhami: That's actually my position
[2015-05-20 09:26:14] WhereIsMySpoon: automated testers == software engineers
[2015-05-20 09:26:30] mekhami: I'm setting them up to do TDD, creating a test framework, and educating their devops team on how to integrate the tests with their build system etc
[2015-05-20 09:26:32] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe not full devs but definitley some sort of software eng
[2015-05-20 09:26:39] mekhami: i'm architecting an entire work flow for a major php project
[2015-05-20 09:26:45] WhereIsMySpoon: oh goody
[2015-05-20 09:26:46] WhereIsMySpoon: php
[2015-05-20 09:26:48] WhereIsMySpoon: we need more of that
[2015-05-20 09:26:54] D3M0S: mekhami, you're actually in luck!!! php
[2015-05-20 09:27:00] D3M0S: dude...use visualphpunit
[2015-05-20 09:27:02] mekhami: i know, i hate it, but that's another decision above my pay grade ;)
[2015-05-20 09:27:18] mekhami: i actually do get to write the selenium tests in python
[2015-05-20 09:27:20] mekhami: which is nice
[2015-05-20 09:27:30] D3M0S: https://github.com/NSinopoli/VisualPHPUnit

[2015-05-20 09:29:11] mekhami: i wonder how bad it's going to be
[2015-05-20 09:29:18] mekhami: to do PHP unit tests and Python functional tests

[2015-05-20 10:48:39] Das_Cheese: well, in firefox. but i don't get to develop the test for chrome
[2015-05-20 10:50:08] Das_Cheese: jimevans: gem -v selenium returns 2.2.2, and ff version is 28.0
[2015-05-20 10:50:35] jimevans: D3M0S: get back in there, i've got meetings.
[2015-05-20 10:50:48] D3M0S: jimevans, haha, I can try
[2015-05-20 10:51:24] Das_Cheese: oh, also, the text field is readonly, as per ext, which isn't helping things.
[2015-05-20 10:51:40] D3M0S: Das_Cheese, why so old on versions? selenium now is at like 2.45 and FF is on 36 or so
[2015-05-20 10:51:54] Das_Cheese: because corporate software >_<
[2015-05-20 10:52:17] D3M0S: humm...so you have control of the selenium versions but not firefox?
[2015-05-20 10:52:48] lukeis: Das_Cheese: gem list selenium
[2015-05-20 10:52:56] lukeis: gem -v    prints the version of gem
[2015-05-20 10:52:57] Das_Cheese: well, the selenium version is a set thing, and it only likes to work with ff versions up to i think 29 or so
[2015-05-20 10:53:02] D3M0S: im so bad at ruby rails
[2015-05-20 10:53:32] Das_Cheese: haha. that call returns 2.44.0, 2.43.0
[2015-05-20 10:53:43] lukeis: 2.45 is the latest :)
[2015-05-20 10:53:54] Das_Cheese: oh okay, so it's decently recent
[2015-05-20 10:54:08] D3M0S: 2.44 was crap on FF though right?
[2015-05-20 10:54:25] lukeis: it was?
[2015-05-20 10:54:38] D3M0S: or was it only FF35 and 2.44 combo?

[2015-05-20 10:55:52] Das_Cheese: >_< fun. did you ever figure out what was going on? or is it just selenium being dumb?
[2015-05-20 10:55:59] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-20 10:56:21] lukeis: Das_Cheese: I would recommend using 2.45 and if you must use an old version of firefox, use 31esr
[2015-05-20 10:56:26] D3M0S: well...as far as I know FF did something wierd, and selenium did something in 2.44 to try and fix it, and it didnt quite hit the mark
[2015-05-20 10:56:51] D3M0S: let me find the release notes
[2015-05-20 10:56:56] lukeis: :changes

[2015-05-20 10:57:31] lukeis: we are on github now!
[2015-05-20 10:57:38] D3M0S: oh yea
[2015-05-20 10:57:39] Das_Cheese: hmm, okay. I can tell the guy in charge of selenium about this. unless there's some workaround for the version we have
[2015-05-20 10:58:28] D3M0S: tell him to definitly upgrade to 2.45 it's far far more stable than 2.44 in my experience
[2015-05-20 10:58:36] lukeis: Das_Cheese: "soon" (which could be weeks or longer) we'll release 2.46 and then you'll want to use FF 38 (an ESR release)

[2015-05-20 11:00:30] Das_Cheese: yeah, i guess i'll see what he says. I guess to make sure there's definitely no other way, are readonly textboxes even send_keys-able?
[2015-05-20 11:00:47] Das_Cheese: i kinda feel like they're not
[2015-05-20 11:01:39] rorycb: Das_Cheese: not sure how Selenium does it, but readonly textboxes don't accept input
[2015-05-20 11:02:05] rorycb: so even if selenium did send text, nothing should happen
[2015-05-20 11:02:24] *rorycb is still trying to get his Selenium juju back'
[2015-05-20 11:02:42] Das_Cheese: oh gotcha. Everyone says that's the only way to fill out a file upload thing...

[2015-05-20 13:20:49] jimevans: riotz: um, huh?
[2015-05-20 13:20:56] riotz: my actual parsing is damn slow.. i need like 30 seconds for one page right now that probably would be parsable in 2 seconds
[2015-05-20 13:21:02] lukeis: that's what i was gonna say ;)
[2015-05-20 13:21:23] jimevans: i feel like i'm missing some context.
[2015-05-20 13:21:24] riotz: so i want to do that part in some kinda offline mode with another lib
[2015-05-20 13:21:47] lukeis: pick your poison, depends on language… but the locators will not be the same
[2015-05-20 13:21:49] jimevans: "parsing". i'm not following at all
[2015-05-20 13:22:07] lukeis: i think they want to slurp the xml and then 'parse' it
[2015-05-20 13:22:13] lukeis: or traverse it
[2015-05-20 13:22:14] jimevans: so you don't want to use a browser to actually parse stuff?
[2015-05-20 13:22:22] riotz: i want to extract data from a table
[2015-05-20 13:22:29] riotz: and test for consitency
[2015-05-20 13:22:41] riotz: so hard to understand?
[2015-05-20 13:22:43] jimevans: that way be serious dragons. html *isn't* xml. it's not properly structured. but whatever.
[2015-05-20 13:22:43] lukeis: yeah, use an http library of your language of choice and an xml parser of your language of choice
[2015-05-20 13:22:56] riotz: yeah thanks
[2015-05-20 13:23:02] riotz: that wasnt my question
[2015-05-20 13:23:07] lukeis: or use htmlunit or phantomjs for better performance
[2015-05-20 13:23:40] lukeis: and with that… i'm going to go take a late lunch :)
[2015-05-20 13:24:06] riotz: i dont want to replace the webdriver
[2015-05-20 13:24:07] jimevans: riotz: clearly i'm dense.
[2015-05-20 13:24:21] jimevans: and for that i apologize.
[2015-05-20 13:24:22] riotz: i just asked for a library with similar kinda locators
[2015-05-20 13:24:36] riotz: that i can use in offline mode
[2015-05-20 13:26:43] jimevans: okay, and again, i'm gonna apologize for being quite thick, but you're wanting to use webdriver to navigate to some page, take the rendered html source of that page, shove it into some other library, and use some other API to use some "locators" to extract some data (you haven't mentioned how you're extracting the data with webdriver that you're finding deficient or unperformant).
[2015-05-20 13:26:52] jimevans: have i got it right?
[2015-05-20 13:27:10] riotz: yep youre 100% right
[2015-05-20 13:27:37] riotz: well.. driver.getSource() will give me the source of the page that i can feed into the other lib
[2015-05-20 13:27:52] riotz: there are people doing that already in python with BeautifulSoup
[2015-05-20 13:28:18] jimevans: yeah, you'd think that'd be the case, that getPageSource() is accurately reliable 100% of the time.
[2015-05-20 13:28:40] riotz: for my usecase it will be ok
[2015-05-20 13:28:47] jimevans: but frankly, the source returned by that is in no way guaranteed to be the same html source the browser renders
[2015-05-20 13:29:02] riotz: the information i need is in there i already checked
[2015-05-20 13:29:42] jimevans: i'd be interested in seeing the code you're using that's giving you performance problems.
[2015-05-20 13:30:10] riotz: jimevans i'm constantly dealing with that problem
[2015-05-20 13:30:26] jimevans: i'm not going to be any help with a java library; i'm just not well-versed enough in the wide ecosystem of all the java libraries that are out there to be able to just "make a recommendation"
[2015-05-20 13:30:38] riotz: as soon there is a table or a page where you have to locate more then 10 values it gets slow
[2015-05-20 13:31:32] D3M0S: riotz, jsoup possibly might be your best bet
[2015-05-20 13:31:35] jimevans: i would dispute that as a global statement. it's going to be far more complicated than that.
[2015-05-20 13:31:38] jimevans: but okay
[2015-05-20 13:31:40] D3M0S: but they won't have the same locators as webdriver
[2015-05-20 13:31:47] D3M0S: you'd need to do some translation there
[2015-05-20 13:32:09] riotz: hmm.. thats ok.. thanks for the tip D3M0S
[2015-05-20 13:32:20] jimevans: you've clearly made up your mind on a solution, so i wish you luck in finding a solution that fits your needs.
[2015-05-20 13:32:20] D3M0S: I'm with jimevans as much as I've dreamed about doing something similar, it eventually comes full circle back to using selenium locators anyways

[2015-05-20 13:33:25] D3M0S: theres just no real way to essentially "have something write page objects for you"
[2015-05-20 13:33:52] D3M0S: riotz, it will be very complicated
[2015-05-20 13:34:04] riotz: D3M0S why?
[2015-05-20 13:34:21] riotz: because of the mix of two synthaxes?
[2015-05-20 13:34:38] D3M0S: 1.  You need to figure out a way to reliably parse the dom, the dom is extreemly complicated
[2015-05-20 13:34:44] riotz: syntaxes
[2015-05-20 13:34:50] mekhami: What's the verdict on testing search functionality? Should this be in unit tests, or should it be handled on the integration side? can selenium help with this sort of thing?
[2015-05-20 13:35:29] sircapsalot: why not both?
[2015-05-20 13:35:40] jimevans: D3M0S: at the risk of putting words in riotz's mouth, i don't think they're worried about creating page objects. they just find the performance of locating things in the browser via webdriver to be deficient ("slow"), so they want to use another engine.
[2015-05-20 13:35:41] D3M0S: mekhami, I've done some of that, we handled it on the integration side(we were testing international characters like uumlat and such), yes selenium was the tool for the job
[2015-05-20 13:35:41] sircapsalot: developers should test their stuff using unit tests
[2015-05-20 13:36:12] riotz: jimevans the architecture here works with pageobjects.. but thanks for caring
[2015-05-20 13:36:21] D3M0S: jimevans, I'd suspect some terrible waiting strategies there
[2015-05-20 13:36:50] riotz: nevertheless there is no need to let selenium parse everything if it takes 30 seconds to finish
[2015-05-20 13:37:11] riotz: i can do my asserts with some other lib aswell on my table without any problems
[2015-05-20 13:37:46] D3M0S: riotz, the parsing and dom traversal isnt THAT slow in selenium, and it's a literal drop in the bucket compared to page loads and third party resources if done correctly
[2015-05-20 13:38:09] D3M0S: you might want to look into implementing a proxy and blacklisting some of the requests that are slowing you down
[2015-05-20 13:38:15] D3M0S: if your waiting strategies are on par
[2015-05-20 13:39:34] riotz: there is a massive bloated communication going on each request to find an element with selenium

[2015-05-20 13:39:51] riotz: this is what slows it down i think
[2015-05-20 13:39:52] mekhami: sircapsalot in this case, they're using elasticsearch. what exactly would be tested in that situation?
[2015-05-20 13:40:08] williara, quitting. (Quit: williara)
[2015-05-20 13:40:24] riotz: since selenium is communicating everytime with the browser for each call to findelement
[2015-05-20 13:40:39] riotz: instead of using some kinda cache or whatever
[2015-05-20 13:40:55] D3M0S: riotz, this really isnt terrible.  So at my last company, we had this thing called thread-local-dns which was dns on it's on thread on the grid nodes
[2015-05-20 13:41:22] D3M0S: we actually took that out, and ended up essentially doing the same thing by proxying back to the machine running the tests
[2015-05-20 13:41:30] D3M0S: so we effectivly doubled every selenium request in doing so
[2015-05-20 13:41:45] D3M0S: we had no noticable difference in test speeds
[2015-05-20 13:41:54] D3M0S: maybe a few seconds on massive tests
[2015-05-20 13:42:17] riotz: yeah but i got another usecase
[2015-05-20 13:42:20] sircapsalot, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-05-20 13:42:36] D3M0S: I'm just saying, if they were really the culprit, we would have seen some crippling behavior
[2015-05-20 13:42:44] riotz: it simply takes selenium 30 seconds to fest all the elements on the page i need
[2015-05-20 13:43:06] riotz: if i do that by hand with getsource and some string functions i end up with 2 seconds
[2015-05-20 13:43:21] D3M0S: are you not lazily initializing your page objects?
[2015-05-20 13:43:25] riotz: but well.. string functions arent realy the way you should parse html source right
[2015-05-20 13:43:50] D3M0S: you use Page Factory and @FindBy annotations yes?
[2015-05-20 13:44:03] riotz: how else should you initialize them if not lazy?
[2015-05-20 13:44:16] riotz: you cant know how the page looks like after 5 clicks
[2015-05-20 13:44:23] D3M0S: well you're saying that it needs to collect everything you need on the page, when in reality the process is far more linear
[2015-05-20 13:45:52] riotz: uhm.. no page factory.. click to new page passes the driver to the contructor and creates a new pageobject for the new page
[2015-05-20 13:45:56] D3M0S: and here's the thing, are you going to call getSource, parse the entire dom into useable objects, after EVERY action?
[2015-05-20 13:46:15] riotz: not after every action only after selected actions
[2015-05-20 13:46:20] riotz: like this table parsing
[2015-05-20 13:46:29] riotz: the rest can be kept like it is

[2015-05-20 13:47:40] riotz: like a simple table.. its just that is a lot of data ive to test for consistency aswell
[2015-05-20 13:47:48] riotz: not only locate a button and click on it
[2015-05-20 13:47:54] riotz: what most of you do
[2015-05-20 13:48:23] D3M0S: maybe we could mock up some code using this: http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/large

[2015-05-20 13:49:02] riotz: yeah that looks like a evil good example
[2015-05-20 13:49:43] jimevans: riotz: have you thought about maybe locating child elements of the table using just javascript and seeing if that improves things?
[2015-05-20 13:50:08] riotz: jimevans nope i havent thought about that.. this sounds good aswell
[2015-05-20 13:51:09] jimevans: i mean, if you're using css selectors, a call to document.querySelector() might be the way to go.
[2015-05-20 13:52:02] riotz: i'm using all except the css selectors right now
[2015-05-20 13:52:10] riotz: they are pretty slow on ff
[2015-05-20 13:53:11] jimevans: please tell me you're not using xpath. that's likely slower than css selectors.
[2015-05-20 13:55:42] riotz: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/eaa723a2b35a1007206c
[2015-05-20 13:55:54] riotz: the code looks something like that right now
[2015-05-20 13:56:03] riotz: and it takes 25 seconds to finish
[2015-05-20 13:56:22] riotz: just for the for loop
[2015-05-20 13:57:30] riotz: with some offline lib you can for sure get this down to 1 second or less
[2015-05-20 13:58:07] jimevans: well for one thing, your xpath is not doing what you think it's doing. :)
[2015-05-20 13:58:20] riotz: and jimevans test have shown that xpath is faster then css with ff and selenium
[2015-05-20 13:58:34] brma: typo on line 15: lenght
[2015-05-20 13:59:13] jimevans: whose tests? on which versions? and dear $(deity) i hope not, since modern websites *rely* on css selectors to render content in the right way.
[2015-05-20 13:59:16] jimevans: but okay.
[2015-05-20 13:59:47] riotz: http://elementalselenium.com/tips/33-xpath-vs-css-revisited
[2015-05-20 14:00:04] riotz: this is one i found now.. there is another guy who did the same with the same results
[2015-05-20 14:01:15] alko, quitting. (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[2015-05-20 14:01:25] jimevans: i'd be interested to see the same tests performed with current versions of the browsers in question, given that firefox 26 is a year old.
[2015-05-20 14:02:20] jimevans: and those test results do *not* support the statement that "xpath is always faster in every case than css selectors"
[2015-05-20 14:02:38] riotz: yeah nevertheless jimevans it wont change much
[2015-05-20 14:03:18] riotz: i already tried to experiment a little bit in this snippet of code and checked different locators
[2015-05-20 14:03:54] riotz: and there isnt much of a change at all.. if i replace all the other locators with xpath ones it gets 3 seconds slower
[2015-05-20 14:03:57] riotz: or something like that
[2015-05-20 14:04:23] riotz: the change in speed by using other locators isnt the fix to my problem
[2015-05-20 14:04:39] jimevans: what does your xpath look like? if it looks like the one in line 13, you're re-finding from the top of the document every tim.
[2015-05-20 14:04:41] jimevans: time
[2015-05-20 14:04:42] jimevans: :)
[2015-05-20 14:05:07] jimevans: but nevertheless, it would be interesting to me to see where the bottleneck is.
[2015-05-20 14:05:09] riotz: yeah i know that.. i was just to lazy to research the correct xpath there
[2015-05-20 14:05:12] riotz: thanks for bashing
[2015-05-20 14:05:52] jimevans: i'm sorry that came across as bashing. wasn't my intent.

[2015-05-20 14:16:25] riotz: its a hog yes.. but not that much if it gets replaced by a proper one
[2015-05-20 14:17:18] jimevans: does it change if you use ".//img" instead of "//img" (note the preceding period)?
[2015-05-20 14:17:21] riotz: oh, and other then that i'm getting an appcrash on ff since the last ff update
[2015-05-20 14:17:24] jimevans: i'm just curious.
[2015-05-20 14:17:33] riotz: on startup.. i have to click on then the test starts
[2015-05-20 14:17:45] riotz: is this known behaivour?
[2015-05-20 14:17:49] jimevans: that's an issue lots of others have been reporting. i've not seen it myself.
[2015-05-20 14:18:06] riotz: in module xul.dll
[2015-05-20 14:18:28] riotz: i click on close program and the browser starts up

[2015-05-20 14:19:25] riotz: The search took: 24
[2015-05-20 14:19:39] riotz: speed up of 1 second
[2015-05-20 14:20:05] riotz: thanks.. i didnt knew about the dot notation
[2015-05-20 14:20:58] D3M0S: have you tried with chrome? is there a requirement to use Firefox?
[2015-05-20 14:21:07] D3M0S: chrome is waaay faster
[2015-05-20 14:21:27] riotz: uhm.. nope havent tried chrome
[2015-05-20 14:21:41] D3M0S: I know it's even faster than phantomJs, but this was a metric taken on phantomJs 1.9 not phantomJs2
[2015-05-20 14:22:38] riotz: hmm.. ok, i'll try that now.. lets see how i get that running
[2015-05-20 14:22:54] jimevans: you *could* try something like the following: https://gist.github.com/jimevans/700d13bdfd949802985a

[2015-05-20 14:23:24] jimevans: (warning: untested code, written without the benefit of an IDE!)
[2015-05-20 14:23:53] riotz: ok then first this javascript test.. lets see
[2015-05-20 14:24:19] D3M0S: yeah, if you're running on windows you need to put chromedriver on your path, which will require a logout/login.
[2015-05-20 14:24:20] jimevans: there's all kinds of pitfalls in that code, mind.
[2015-05-20 14:25:12] jimevans: and i've probably screwed *something* up in ginning that up.
[2015-05-20 14:25:55] jimevans: but i'm pretty sure the concept is sound.
[2015-05-20 14:27:11] jimevans: of course, if you *really* wanted to shove the whole thing into a single javascript call and get the elements back, you could.
[2015-05-20 14:27:35] riotz: The search took: 12
[2015-05-20 14:27:44] jimevans: rather than a javascript call per time through the loop, just put the whole loop in the javascript function
[2015-05-20 14:27:46] riotz: thats quite a improvement
[2015-05-20 14:28:57] riotz: all good except the img.sprite one
[2015-05-20 14:29:48] jimevans: yeah, that's the wrong selector for that one.
[2015-05-20 14:29:55] jimevans: i misread the original gist.
[2015-05-20 14:31:13] jimevans: you want 'img[sprite]'
[2015-05-20 14:31:21] jimevans: updated my gist to reflect that.
[2015-05-20 14:32:05] riotz: The search took: 14
[2015-05-20 14:32:20] riotz: so thats an effective improvement of 11 seconds now
[2015-05-20 14:33:23] jimevans: i mean, i dunno what the DOM looks like of the actual page you're using, so i'm shooting half-blind as far as suggestions.
[2015-05-20 14:33:29] riotz: probably that slow since i'm calling things like getAttribute and getText on the fetched elements aswell which isnt reflected in the gist
[2015-05-20 14:34:03] riotz: javascript is a good way to improve the whole thing for sure
[2015-05-20 14:34:16] jimevans: getText is one of the most computationally expensive things you can do with webdriver.
[2015-05-20 14:35:06] riotz: so how else do you get the text?
[2015-05-20 14:35:10] jimevans: mostly because internally, it relies on figuring out what elements (both up *and* down the DOM tree) are "visible" before it can figure out what text is displayed.
[2015-05-20 14:35:35] jimevans: the answer (as with most complicated questions) is, "it depends"
[2015-05-20 14:35:43] jimevans: most of the time, getText is good enough
[2015-05-20 14:36:06] jimevans: in cases like yours, you might be able to leverage javascript.
[2015-05-20 14:36:28] D3M0S: riotz, http://pastebin.com/MTUQqLtB
[2015-05-20 14:37:32] jimevans: D3M0S: that'll do next to nothing to help the performance issue, which is the whole point here.
[2015-05-20 14:37:49] D3M0S: yeah, I didn't think so, but I think it makes better page objects :)
[2015-05-20 14:39:37] jimevans: riotz: but to answer your question, you could use the textContent property of the element.

[2015-05-20 14:54:55] jimevans: you mentioned the browser version earlier.
[2015-05-20 14:55:25] riotz: The search took: 5 with my old code
[2015-05-20 14:55:30] D3M0S: jimevans, wasnt there a little warning with 2.45 that tests with firefox can take a bit longer than expected.
[2015-05-20 14:55:33] riotz: so chrome is realy a lot faster like it seems

[2015-05-20 15:00:52] D3M0S: but its a very difficult problem

[2015-05-20 15:02:24] D3M0S: I think the lesson I've learned is, webdriver is very very good at doing it's job if applied correctly, there are a few things that it's not good at that are annoying...and can only really be accomplished with long winded code.
[2015-05-20 15:03:08] D3M0S: but those things are so complex to deal with in an efficient manner, that they're almost an entirely new project to attempt to tackle, whereas selenium CAN do them, just not as concisely as it does other things.
[2015-05-20 15:03:19] riotz: what i learned today.. but what i knew already is that dont rely on those pesky locators that the webdriver provides
[2015-05-20 15:04:06] riotz: javascript or some offline lib will always speed things up by a big factor
[2015-05-20 15:04:13] D3M0S: yeah, well, it was designed to include the javascript executors because javascript is very good at it's job too....and there's no point in reinventing the wheel there.
[2015-05-20 15:04:42] D3M0S: so used correctly as an API, which includes utilizing javascript executors where necessary, its a very good tool

[2015-05-20 15:09:01] jc2121: Is there a cssSelector way of locating the third item on the page with class="whatever"?
[2015-05-20 15:11:21] D3M0S: By.cssSelector(".whatever[2]")
[2015-05-20 15:11:23] D3M0S: I think
[2015-05-20 15:11:35] D3M0S: give it a try, I'm trying to find where to confirm now
[2015-05-20 15:11:50] jc2121: I'll give that a shot.  I can't seem to find anything like that when googling.
[2015-05-20 15:12:12] D3M0S: it makes logical sense to me, but I'm not 100% sure it's correct
[2015-05-20 15:12:15] dude-x: jc2121: nth of type
[2015-05-20 15:12:26] dude-x: D3M0S: that won’t work
[2015-05-20 15:12:33] D3M0S: dude-x, thought not
[2015-05-20 15:13:25] dude-x: Xpath it would be //div/*[@class=“whatever”][3]” may work
[2015-05-20 15:13:26] D3M0S: By.cssSelector(".whatever:nth-of-type(3)")
[2015-05-20 15:13:28] D3M0S: is that right?
[2015-05-20 15:13:37] dude-x: D3M0S: maybe

[2015-05-20 15:14:15] dude-x: The way CSS counts things is confusing to me, i just play with the firepath tool until I get a match
[2015-05-20 15:14:27] dude-x: also google css3 selectors
[2015-05-20 15:14:51] D3M0S: haha same here, nth of type makes it seem like it should be 3, but actually in xpath because its an array it would be [2]
[2015-05-20 15:17:08] jc2121: thx.
[2015-05-20 15:17:19] jc2121: Still trying to figure out the right way to format it.
[2015-05-20 15:22:35] D3M0S: im trying to find a blogpost that I knew had really good info on css selectors with lots of examples
[2015-05-20 15:24:39] jc2121: Can't seem to get it to work.
[2015-05-20 15:25:20] jc2121: I think I'll find the closest element I CAN get, and then make my way there with "+" and ">".  Ugly.
[2015-05-20 15:26:18] D3M0S: one way is to make a list of webelements using findElements and then iterate over that list and use something within that webelement to help you find the "correct" one
