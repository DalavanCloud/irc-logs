[2015-05-18 05:15:20] Anton2k: Trying to understand what Grid is, i understand that i can point my tests to web driver and have web driver run the tests. Without reading in any great depth into grid, would I would be safe to assume the grid is used for distrubuting tests to remote web drivers. So say for talking sake I had a test i wanted to run from my server in the us aswell as my server in the uk, grid enables be to do this? if not could someone point me to a
[2015-05-18 05:19:08] WhereIsMySpoon: Anton2k: yep, thats pretty much it
[2015-05-18 05:20:56] WhereIsMySpoon: Anton2k: you can have say one machine with jenkins and the grid plugin (which just runs a grid server) and then register remote nodes to that grid
[2015-05-18 05:21:27] WhereIsMySpoon: then when you execute tests via jenkins the test will run through grid and be passed to your remote node(s)
[2015-05-18 05:21:47] WhereIsMySpoon: Anton2k: PLEASE NOTE: grid does not magically parallel your tests, it only gives the ability to
[2015-05-18 05:21:59] WhereIsMySpoon: you need to either write parallelism for your tests or use a test runner that will do it

[2015-05-18 05:28:41] Anton2k: Thanks WhereIsMySpoon i dont really know about nodes or jenkins yet, last time i used selenium i was using RC server, i recored my script using the IDE in FireFox and then played back those tests ether in the IDE or in the server? i could be wrong it was a while ago now.
[2015-05-18 05:29:27] WhereIsMySpoon: Anton2k: ok you're talking about the IDE indeed, you should use WebDriver and program your tests
[2015-05-18 05:29:38] WhereIsMySpoon: seleniumhq.org
[2015-05-18 05:29:46] WhereIsMySpoon: some documentation, tutorials there
[2015-05-18 05:30:19] Anton2k: I am also not sure what you mean by writing parallelisim for my tests, dosent every one use the IDE and then the web driver for further tweaking? ill have a look at the tuts thanks
[2015-05-18 05:31:10] WhereIsMySpoon: Anton2k: dont worry about parallelism for now
[2015-05-18 05:31:16] WhereIsMySpoon: i assumed you were a webdriver user already
[2015-05-18 05:31:25] WhereIsMySpoon: Anton2k: no, you  should not use the ide at all
[2015-05-18 05:31:54] WhereIsMySpoon: it produces flaky code and bad element find statements
[2015-05-18 05:32:31] Anton2k: Ah really? i thought the whole point of the IDE was make test case recording easier?
[2015-05-18 05:32:42] Anton2k: web driver you have to write it all manually, right?

[2015-05-18 09:22:56] jimevans: lukeis: since when does switchTo().alert() rely on implicit waits?

[2015-05-18 09:23:14] lukeis: since apparently it always has? :)
[2015-05-18 09:23:15] jimevans: i guarantee the IE driver doesn't behave that way.
[2015-05-18 09:23:20] jimevans: and never has
[2015-05-18 09:23:21] lukeis: firefox does...
[2015-05-18 09:23:59] lukeis: i'm sure this behavior is not described in the spec anywhere? :)
[2015-05-18 09:24:07] jimevans: anybody want to hazard a guess what chrome does?
[2015-05-18 09:25:41] jimevans: the spec specifically sates that the "implicit wait timeout â€¦ specifies a time to wait for the implicit element location strategy when locating elements using find element and find elements"

[2015-05-18 09:27:58] lukeis: commenting on the bug
[2015-05-18 09:28:41] nedo007: any ideea why chrome doesn't start all the time when using chromedriver and pyvirtualdisplay?
[2015-05-18 09:29:54] swampdragons, leaving. (#selenium)
[2015-05-18 09:30:15] jimevans: of course, i reckon the spec wording will become clearer as the alert handing command specifications become more algorithmic in keeping with where we need the spec to be.

[2015-05-18 09:35:14] jimevans: dawagner had a long dissertation on why that was needed.
[2015-05-18 09:36:26] jleyba: jimevans, something to do with the alert notification service not being super responsive

[2015-05-18 09:42:25] jimevans: ?
[2015-05-18 09:42:25] lukeis: 34?
[2015-05-18 09:42:30] lukeis: it's in the :changelog
[2015-05-18 09:42:44] lukeis: 33!
[2015-05-18 09:42:46] jimevans: yep. that's it.
[2015-05-18 09:43:25] lukeis: 38 is the esr, right?
[2015-05-18 09:43:37] jimevans: should be, if the pattern holds.
[2015-05-18 09:43:38] dude-x: 38 is indeed the next ESR
[2015-05-18 09:43:55] dude-x: and current
[2015-05-18 09:44:05] lukeis: we can / should drop 24esr native events then

[2015-05-18 12:58:28] AutomatedTester: can we set implicitWait via capabilities?
[2015-05-18 12:58:45] jimevans: nope.
[2015-05-18 12:59:08] AutomatedTester: would it make sense to?
[2015-05-18 12:59:26] jimevans: well, i suppose an implementation might allow it, but currently there's at least one where it's true that we don't. :)
[2015-05-18 12:59:27] *AutomatedTester is thinking yes but would love others thoughts'
[2015-05-18 12:59:55] jimevans: in addition to being able to set it with the API call?
[2015-05-18 13:00:00] AutomatedTester: yes
[2015-05-18 13:00:01] jimevans: or instead of?

[2015-05-18 13:04:38] AutomatedTester: jimevans: so my thinking is that capabilities should be used to get your session to the correct place before a session is started. So with taht in mind, pageLoadStrategies and implicitTimeouts and the like would be useful at the beginning of the session
[2015-05-18 13:04:57] AutomatedTester: but I am not going to fight either way
[2015-05-18 13:05:04] AutomatedTester: just wanting others opinions
[2015-05-18 13:06:06] jimevans: like i said, i prefer the cleanliness of a single touch point, but it really doesn't matter to me that much.
[2015-05-18 13:06:22] lukeis:  Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯   the way the spec is worded with creating a new session, one could implement accepting implicit timeout on the capabilitiesâ€¦ but we don't specify what the key name would be
[2015-05-18 13:06:42] AutomatedTester: lukeis: I am just about to do that
[2015-05-18 13:06:45] lukeis: "Initialise the following if not set while processing capabilities:"

[2015-05-18 14:35:35] j_t: :(
[2015-05-18 14:36:42] D3M0S: j_t, I'd probably recommend selenium IDE though(probably the first time I've ever said that), do you always enter the same times?
[2015-05-18 14:37:14] j_t: D3M0S: yes
[2015-05-18 14:37:20] j_t: I'm like a robot repeating the same tasks

[2015-05-18 14:37:53] j_t: I looked up the rest api, but it's not turned on. and getting them to turn it on will be difficult, since I'm in a large bureaucracy
[2015-05-18 14:37:53] D3M0S: yeah, just download selenium IDE and record it...if it's a one-off script that's your best(and easiest) bet
[2015-05-18 14:38:03] j_t: but I'm willing to learn/figure out selenium, if this will do it.
[2015-05-18 14:38:10] j_t: D3M0S: nice, great tip
[2015-05-18 14:38:16] j_t: I was wondering if I could 'record' it.
[2015-05-18 14:38:40] D3M0S: you can with selenium IDE, but it's not great for "seriously automating things"
[2015-05-18 14:38:52] D3M0S: if you only have a few scripts then it's acceptable
[2015-05-18 14:38:58] gabecase: Web driver master race
[2015-05-18 14:39:02] D3M0S: if you're going to test the oracle website, don't use IDE
[2015-05-18 14:39:58] D3M0S: gabecase, I'm with you there, I've never seriously recommended IDE to anybody before, but it actually seems like the right tool for the job here
[2015-05-18 14:40:23] j_t: If anything the IDE seems reasonable to see the code and figure out how selenium works
[2015-05-18 14:40:49] j_t: or figure out how I can get selenium to roughly do a thing I want it to do.
[2015-05-18 14:41:02] D3M0S: j_t, it's a good place to start.  if you actually want to code it, I recommend going though the WebDriver google example

[2015-05-18 14:42:25] D3M0S: lol
[2015-05-18 14:42:25] j_t: It's a chrome extension?
