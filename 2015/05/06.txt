[2015-05-06 11:00:34] sircapsalot: it's whatever you want eindoofus.  database, or flat file

[2015-05-06 11:01:01] sircapsalot: no practice is "better" than the other I don't think.. although, for optimization reasons, databases would be better if there are thousands of different records
[2015-05-06 11:01:05] CSWookie: lukeis: This is not looking promising.
[2015-05-06 11:01:53] eindoofus: sircapsalot, is there some design strategy i can use for organizing such files? could see this getting messy fast
[2015-05-06 11:02:40] sircapsalot: an example that I've used before, is if you are using Java, you could just have a .properties file
[2015-05-06 11:02:47] sircapsalot: and read in all of the options to validate
[2015-05-06 11:03:21] eindoofus: i see. so map a test case with an entry in the properties file that points to the needed file?
[2015-05-06 11:03:33] sircapsalot: sure, that's one way to do it
[2015-05-06 11:03:44] sircapsalot: MyTestsA.java   reads MyTestsA.properties

[2015-05-06 14:50:14] jimevans: bleeet: you have a couple of options. you can use *sigh* nuget to handle your references, or you can download the .net bindings from https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html.
[2015-05-06 14:51:02] bleeet: which do you prefer?
[2015-05-06 14:51:35] jimevans: which version of visual studio are you using?

[2015-05-06 14:55:06] bleeet: what is my next step
[2015-05-06 14:55:11] jimevans: you'll need to extract the assemblies somewhere.
[2015-05-06 14:55:21] jimevans: i.e., unzip the file
[2015-05-06 14:55:23] bleeet: sorry I am new to selenium as you can see thanks for helping me
[2015-05-06 14:55:46] bleeet: ok I just put them on my desktop
[2015-05-06 14:56:13] jimevans: ugh. okay. i'd put them somewhere closely related to your actual code, but whatever.
[2015-05-06 14:56:25] bleeet: ok sure I will move them
[2015-05-06 14:56:39] bleeet: I just thought that would make this faster
[2015-05-06 14:56:41] jimevans: now open up visual studio, and open up your webdriver vb.net project

[2015-05-06 15:05:19] jimevans: "linked"? the server will be found if it's in the same directory as your executable/class library.
[2015-05-06 15:05:29] bleeet: oh it's not
[2015-05-06 15:05:44] jimevans: otherwise, you can pass it in as part of the constructor for the driver.
[2015-05-06 15:05:58] bleeet: how do i do that?
[2015-05-06 15:06:36] jimevans: updated the gist
[2015-05-06 15:08:44] bleeet: does not work

[2015-05-06 15:09:44] bleeet: is the path i put
[2015-05-06 15:09:55] jimevans: don't put IEDriverServer.exe in the constructor call. just the directory name.
[2015-05-06 15:10:21] bleeet: still gives me an error when I press play
[2015-05-06 15:10:33] bleeet: start i mean
[2015-05-06 15:10:34] jimevans: please :gist the exact error
[2015-05-06 15:10:50] jimevans: also, have you unblocked the executable?
[2015-05-06 15:10:57] jimevans: for IEDriverServer.exe?
[2015-05-06 15:11:21] bleeet: no i have not touched it besides unzip the file
[2015-05-06 15:12:05] jimevans: you need to, or the executable can't start. navigate to the file, right click on it, choose Properties, and click the "Unblock" button
[2015-05-06 15:12:52] bleeet: ok done
[2015-05-06 15:13:10] bleeet: updated the gist
[2015-05-06 15:13:13] jimevans: can you actually run the IEDriverServer.exe executable manually?

[2015-05-06 15:15:00] jimevans: good. then you're okay. given your comment to the gist, i assume the full path (including file name) to IEDriverServer.exe is "C:\Users\user\Downloads\IEDriverServer\IEDriverServer.exe"
[2015-05-06 15:15:13] jimevans: is that correct?

[2015-05-06 15:16:20] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-06 15:16:27] bleeet: but take out the exe as you said before
[2015-05-06 15:17:10] jimevans: then in your constructor should be "C:\Users\user\Downloads". as i said above "just the directory name"
[2015-05-06 15:17:48] bleeet: ok so take tou the \IEDriverServer.exe
[2015-05-06 15:17:56] bleeet: i see
[2015-05-06 15:18:09] uDie_: how do i make selenium see the rendered angular directives?

[2015-05-06 15:20:36] jimevans: bleeet: how is your code compiling? if your gist comment is correct, you need the path in quotes. it's a string. if it's not correct, please correct it.
[2015-05-06 15:20:52] AutomatedTester: can we remove visibility yet?
[2015-05-06 15:21:07] jimevans: remember, you'll need to escape the backslashes.

[2015-05-06 15:25:35] jimevans: bleeet: at the right-hand edge of the blue squiggly, there should be a little red tag. hover over the little red tag, it'll turn into a drop down that will give you the option of how to fix it.
[2015-05-06 15:25:36] dude-x: that's worrysome
[2015-05-06 15:25:49] uDie_: it's perfectly valid angular.
[2015-05-06 15:25:50] dude-x: because the app i will have to automate is using angular
[2015-05-06 15:25:52] jleyba: that direct is transformed into a dom you can manipulate
[2015-05-06 15:25:59] jleyba: directive*
[2015-05-06 15:26:15] dude-x: yeah that's true
[2015-05-06 15:26:27] bleeet: it works now!! thanks so much
[2015-05-06 15:26:33] uDie_: it is. but selenium doesn't see it
[2015-05-06 15:26:39] uDie_: not even after waiting 20 seconds
[2015-05-06 15:26:40] jleyba: yes it does
[2015-05-06 15:26:49] jleyba: I know 100% for a fact selenium works fine with angular
[2015-05-06 15:26:51] bleeet: I am guessing I can use the smae syntax as vba in excel to automate in ie?
[2015-05-06 15:26:52] jimevans: bleeet: actually you could resolve it by simply adding "Import OpenQA.Selenium.IE" (no quotes) to the top of your code, but following the prompts given you you by the IDE is a skill you'll want to be comfortable with.
[2015-05-06 15:26:59] jleyba: b/c protractor is built on selenium
[2015-05-06 15:27:06] jimevans: bleeet: probably. i don't know the wrapper.
[2015-05-06 15:27:14] dude-x: uDie_: that's a different problem then; if you wait for an element for an eternity then it won't work
[2015-05-06 15:27:24] dude-x: you have to wait on an intermediate element
[2015-05-06 15:27:32] uDie_: your'e supposed to wait for the list to populate
[2015-05-06 15:27:40] uDie_: you can't just scrape it before angular does its magic
[2015-05-06 15:27:43] uDie_: wrong order.

[2015-05-06 15:28:03] bleeet: also where do you recomend me putting the net35 net 40 flies and idedriver
[2015-05-06 15:28:18] uDie_: dude-x i tried that
[2015-05-06 15:28:22] jleyba: if you're using selenium in js or dart, use protractor
[2015-05-06 15:28:27] uDie_: the only other "option" for me now is javascript.
[2015-05-06 15:28:33] jleyba: if you're using another language, look at what protractor does
[2015-05-06 15:28:49] jimevans: bleeet: that's entirely up to you. i usually put them in a 'lib' directory
[2015-05-06 15:28:49] jleyba: angular exposes hooks selenium can use to know exactly when ti is done manipulating the dom
[2015-05-06 15:29:11] bleeet: ah ok thanks so much
[2015-05-06 15:29:20] jimevans: glad to help
[2015-05-06 15:29:33] dude-x: jleyba: sort of like jquery.active for ajax updates?
[2015-05-06 15:29:36] bleeet: now I hope I can use the same sytnax i sed in excel

[2015-05-06 15:30:54] dude-x: jleyba: where can i find documentation on these hooks? has anyone blogged about this?
[2015-05-06 15:31:25] jleyba: dude-x, You're not really meant to use them directly. Protractor is angular's end-to-end test framework

[2015-05-06 15:34:07] uDie_: it is not "for a fact selenium works fine with angular"
[2015-05-06 15:34:56] dude-x: thanks
[2015-05-06 15:34:59] uDie_: protractor is just supposed to be a wrapper for timing.  my issue is NOT timing

[2015-05-06 15:50:47] uDie: i can find it via jquery and old document.findlement blah blah javascript
[2015-05-06 15:51:25] Selenium-Github: [13selenium] 15tobli opened pull request #532: Replace custom PATH_SEPARATOR with path.delimiter. (06master...06path-delimiter) 02http://git.io/vJNYJ
[2015-05-06 15:51:41] uDie: the code right now for debugging purposes is Thread.sleep(20000); driver.findElement(By.id("iforgettheID"))
[2015-05-06 15:52:09] dude-x: which is a reasonable thing to do...
[2015-05-06 15:52:54] uDie: if the javascript executor works and the selenium find by id doesn't work... there's something going on
[2015-05-06 15:53:33] uDie: selenium is telling me that the code isn't there via getAttribute("innerHTML") and getPageSource().  and that corroborates with the error that it can't find the element
[2015-05-06 15:53:33] dude-x: uDie: how does the ID look like?
[2015-05-06 15:53:50] dude-x: but page source doesn't show it either... hmm
[2015-05-06 15:54:00] dude-x: is it just firefox? or is it chrome too?
[2015-05-06 15:54:17] uDie: chrome too. the page source shows the content
[2015-05-06 15:54:31] uDie: in the browser page source. Not the selenium getPageSource
[2015-05-06 15:54:54] uDie: http://www.pasteall.org/58272   <---- selenium page source.
[2015-05-06 15:56:39] dude-x: uDie: you reminded me of something.... I remember at a prior job, that there was some javascript that would modify the DOM that only the browser could see but not Selenium
[2015-05-06 15:57:00] dude-x: i had to use executeJavascript to get the true value.
[2015-05-06 15:57:11] uDie: I am trying to avoid that as much as possible
[2015-05-06 15:57:48] dude-x: it was this list of things where you can highlight and it had checkboxes; clicking a checkbox didn't reveal itself to selenium
[2015-05-06 15:58:14] dude-x: it caused the state to change for the element, but selenium could not see it for some reason.
[2015-05-06 15:58:29] dude-x: however IE could see the changes which was i why was able to figure out the code to write
[2015-05-06 15:58:44] uDie: but you could $("#someID") or findElementById it
[2015-05-06 15:59:06] dude-x: i was able to locate the element but it did not have the attribute i was looking for
[2015-05-06 15:59:14] dude-x: but it was there when you looked at firefox
[2015-05-06 15:59:35] uDie: yes. this is exactly what i'm experiencing.
[2015-05-06 15:59:39] jimevans: jleyba: https://twitter.com/thejohnjansen/status/596083813328887808
[2015-05-06 15:59:40] uDie: did you happen to file a bug somewhere?
[2015-05-06 15:59:57] uDie: or you just went ahead with javascript and said "ok fine.
[2015-05-06 16:00:14] dude-x: uDie: i didn't file a bug because it seemed like a bug to firefox;
[2015-05-06 16:01:06] dude-x: plus i didn't know how to get a minimal reproducible test case
[2015-05-06 16:02:25] uDie: heh. oh well. i'll just do the javascript executor thing.  i don't really have time to put everything together. especially with the hippa compliance i need to follow
[2015-05-06 16:03:05] uDie: i don't know how it would be a firefox bug anyways
[2015-05-06 16:03:09] dude-x: at another job, i was unable to click on a checkbox, but that turned out to be bad HTML because the divs overlapped each other
[2015-05-06 16:03:14] uDie: chrome and other browsers are the same. only selenium is different
[2015-05-06 16:03:24] dude-x: i think even FireBug couldn't see the state change.
