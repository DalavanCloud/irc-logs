[2015-05-05 06:59:10] beaconwriter: I'm trying to write a java method to just check if an element is on the page or not but it keeps on failing when i try to change the implicit wait time
[2015-05-05 06:59:12] beaconwriter: https://ideone.com/g2rBTd
[2015-05-05 06:59:36] Dave_B_: ugh, implicit waits
[2015-05-05 06:59:55] beaconwriter: yeah, i can't control the system defaults where i work
[2015-05-05 07:00:13] Dave_B_: I'd be looking to set it to 0 if anything!
[2015-05-05 07:01:22] Dave_B_: I'd probably go for a much shorter implementation (just return if length of elements is > 0)
[2015-05-05 07:01:26] Dave_B_: but shouldn't crash...

[2015-05-05 07:05:35] beaconwriter: or on the line where i initially try to reset the implicit wait
[2015-05-05 07:07:27] Dave_B_: so I'd generally avoid setting an implicit wait to anything other than 0 because then you're at the mercy of your browsers implementation which may vary
[2015-05-05 07:07:43] Dave_B_: though if it won't let you set it to 0 then that's a bit harder
[2015-05-05 07:08:03] Dave_B_: findElements with an implicit wait doesn't really make sense in my head anyway (what are we waiting for?)
[2015-05-05 07:10:45] beaconwriter: I need to verify that a quote we are supplying has the proper text. However sometimes there is a button that needs to be clicked in order to view the quote. I want to say "if(there is a button) click the button"
[2015-05-05 07:11:19] beaconwriter: Don't want to wait our default 30 seconds for the button to appear
[2015-05-05 07:11:50] Dave_B_: explicit waits are great for this kind of situation
[2015-05-05 07:11:57] Dave_B_: though not so hot as combos
[2015-05-05 07:12:01] Dave_B_: with implicit
[2015-05-05 07:12:05] beaconwriter: Is there a way to supply an explicit wait time to findElement?
[2015-05-05 07:12:21] Dave_B_: no, explicit waits get handled on your side

[2015-05-05 07:18:55] Dave_B_: with 0 implicit wait that'll work well - with implicit waits set it won't work so well

[2015-05-05 14:28:10] smccarthy: kyoob: no, I do not think it HAS to work like that
[2015-05-05 14:28:32] kyoob: it'd be cool if it did
[2015-05-05 14:29:21] smccarthy: kyoob: you can get the current window handle before you open any new windows, than always go back to that original one if needed
[2015-05-05 14:30:21] kyoob: i do that, but i have a case where i need to open two windows from the original and make sure both load
[2015-05-05 14:30:32] kyoob: it's just a minor juggling act that that would've solved
[2015-05-05 14:30:40] smccarthy: yup...
[2015-05-05 14:31:02] smccarthy: i could be wrong, as I am no expert.
[2015-05-05 14:31:49] kyoob: iirc the windows are put into that set in no predictable order
[2015-05-05 14:31:57] kyoob: but i wanted to double check

[2015-05-05 14:40:56] MonkeysPaw: kyoob: couldn't you just do a conditional check in a for loop to grab the desired window? It's only three windows and you know which ones are the beginning and the end, yeah?
[2015-05-05 14:41:16] kyoob: well, yeah, that's what i'm doing
[2015-05-05 14:41:16] jimevans: :log
[2015-05-05 14:41:27] kyoob: but that's a far sight form knowing i can just go to window[2]
[2015-05-05 14:41:42] MonkeysPaw: *chuckles*
[2015-05-05 14:42:40] kyoob: laziness is a virtue
[2015-05-05 14:42:50] jimevans: kyoob: you are correct in that the return result from getWindowHandles is in no specific order. this, in fact, is explicit in the api.
[2015-05-05 14:43:14] kyoob: ok cool

[2015-05-05 14:45:22] jimevans: s'up?
[2015-05-05 14:45:31] jimevans: bleeet: what trouble are you having?
[2015-05-05 14:47:39] MonkeysPaw: kyoob: I suppose you could have a variable set up in the initial for loop that you used to switch to the 3rd window and use it to store the id value for that window handle. That way you aren't doing the for loop dance every time you want to nab that middle window.
[2015-05-05 14:49:57] jimevans: i don't remember what language binding kyoob is using, but the .net bindings have a popupwindowfinder class designed to make it a little easier to get the newly opened window handle.
[2015-05-05 14:50:12] jimevans: linq is pretty cool for that kind of thing.
[2015-05-05 14:50:14] kyoob: i'm in java land
[2015-05-05 14:51:02] kyoob: i mean i've got the names of the two windows already open, it's easy enough to say "make sure there are X windows open, and go to the one that is neither this one nor that one"
[2015-05-05 14:52:22] kyoob: but if i could dream up a better api, it'd index the windows automagically

[2015-05-05 15:01:42] jimevans: kyoob: sounds like something we could do in the w3c spec. you might raise an issue with the working group, if it means that much to you.
[2015-05-05 15:02:00] kyoob: what on github?
[2015-05-05 15:02:52] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the twitters is full of MS circling SF
[2015-05-05 15:02:55] jimevans: the spec is there, yes
[2015-05-05 15:03:31] jimevans: AutomatedTester: not just the twitters. it's been a topic of some speculation among us rank and file too. :)
[2015-05-05 15:03:59] AutomatedTester: jimevans: would you ask for a transfer to the IE team?

[2015-05-05 15:05:27] AutomatedTester: jimevans: things to ask 1) where is the webdriver update? 2) how does it work with Edge? 3) is he going to reply to bugmail for me?

[2015-05-05 15:07:37] ckenst: Hello everyone. I'm trying to detect when a modal dialog is no longer displayed
[2015-05-05 15:07:56] ckenst: I have a div id for the modal element and I know that when the dialog closes the style is set to none
[2015-05-05 15:08:06] ckenst: but I don't know where to go from here. any ideas?
[2015-05-05 15:08:57] jimevans: ckenst: so checking isDisplayed on the element doesn't work?
[2015-05-05 15:09:47] ckenst: when the page loads, the dialog displays for maybe a few seconds and then closes
[2015-05-05 15:10:05] jimevans: so you have a race condition.
[2015-05-05 15:10:43] seljenkinsbot: Yippee, build fixed!

[2015-05-05 15:10:53] jimevans: but again, does checking for isDisplayed work? does isDisplayed properly return true when the dialog element is visible, and false when it's not?
[2015-05-05 15:11:51] ckenst: @jimevans I believe so
[2015-05-05 15:12:24] jimevans: then you check for element.isDisplayed to return false.
[2015-05-05 15:12:34] jimevans: once it does, the dialog has disappeared.
[2015-05-05 15:12:50] jimevans: yes, you have to check for the race condition
[2015-05-05 15:12:58] jimevans: but that's a separate matter altogether
[2015-05-05 15:13:59] ckenst: @jimevans: thanks, I'm new to this. Im doing find_element(id: 'tag').displayed?
[2015-05-05 15:14:13] ckenst: that's the same as element.isDisplayed, right?
[2015-05-05 15:14:18] jimevans: ckenst: assuming you're using ruby, yes
[2015-05-05 15:14:23] ckenst: yes, ok
[2015-05-05 15:14:31] jimevans: in .NET, it'd be element.Displayed
[2015-05-05 15:14:41] jimevans: in python, element.is_displayed
[2015-05-05 15:14:42] jimevans: :)

[2015-05-05 15:21:29] ckenst: jimevans: checking for isDisplayed does not work. it appears regardless of whe the dialog element is visible or not
[2015-05-05 15:21:49] jimevans: ckenst: well that's a problem then.
[2015-05-05 15:22:48] ckenst: looks like it has a style element on the div that changes to none
[2015-05-05 15:25:04] jimevans: ckenst: that might be a bug in isDisplayed. i'd probably expect it to return false in that case.
[2015-05-05 15:25:32] jimevans: nevertheless, you can always check the appropriate css property
[2015-05-05 15:25:43] jimevans: check it for a value of 'none'. that might work.
