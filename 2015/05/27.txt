[2015-05-27 05:00:35] pte_petey: and what are the procedures you use in going from test case to automated script
[2015-05-27 05:06:52] AutomatedTester: pte_petey: I wouldnt make an automated test if I couldnt recoup the cost of making it and maintaining it. Automated tests have a pay it forward system and if it's going to be inherently flaky or hard to maintain then don't make it

[2015-05-27 07:38:38] cptjesus: I'm just taking screenshots of pages and discarding it if it doesn't load fast enough
[2015-05-27 07:38:58] cptjesus: The issue is that firefox's timeout seems to be inherently broken in some weird way

[2015-05-27 07:39:43] D3M0S: cptjesus, hummm, and this is on 2.45?  I've heard that this build has had some issues, 2.46 should be out very soon.
[2015-05-27 07:40:44] cptjesus: Yeah, looks like pip is using 2.45.0

[2015-05-27 07:42:19] D3M0S: yeah, I think this might have been addressed in 2.46

[2015-05-27 07:45:47] cptjesus: True

[2015-05-27 08:11:27] cptjesus: AutomatedTester, yes

[2015-05-27 08:13:08] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-27 08:14:15] cptjesus: If you are...then it might be an issue with the version of firefox being used

[2015-05-27 08:17:22] AutomatedTester: cptjesus: I am getting 1 and then what I suspect is happening is that Firefox is looking at its cache before loading the page again
[2015-05-27 08:17:46] cptjesus: AutomatedTester, the problem is that it can cause Selenium to hang indefinitely
[2015-05-27 08:18:17] cptjesus: If you're hitting a page which actually doesn't load
[2015-05-27 08:18:36] cptjesus: It will never throw that timeout exception, this test case suceeds because google loads properly
[2015-05-27 08:18:53] AutomatedTester: now that sounds like a real problem
[2015-05-27 08:19:22] AutomatedTester: and that is with page timeout set?
[2015-05-27 08:19:29] cptjesus: Yep
[2015-05-27 08:19:37] cptjesus: I cant find a web page to test it on
[2015-05-27 08:20:12] AutomatedTester: I have seen people mention this when CDNs are being normal

[2015-05-27 08:20:56] cptjesus: So lets say you hit 2 different sites, neither of which will ever load due to w/e
[2015-05-27 08:21:03] cptjesus: The first site WILL throw a timeoutexception
[2015-05-27 08:21:08] cptjesus: And then you move to site 2
[2015-05-27 08:21:08] |zzy, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-27 08:21:14] cptjesus: Site 2 will NEVER throw a timeout exception
[2015-05-27 08:21:17] cptjesus: So unless you ctrl + c it
[2015-05-27 08:21:19] AutomatedTester: hmm
[2015-05-27 08:21:23] cptjesus: That selenium driver is gone
[2015-05-27 08:21:43] cptjesus: Same issue is not reproducible in the PhantomJS driver
[2015-05-27 08:22:13] AutomatedTester: phantomjs doesnt have the same caching principles as a real browser
[2015-05-27 08:22:21] cptjesus: Sure
[2015-05-27 08:22:43] AutomatedTester: so it could be that the cache "thinks" its there but its not really
[2015-05-27 08:22:47] cptjesus: So in our application, we had to fix the timeout issue by explicitly destroying the firefoxdriver on each timeout
[2015-05-27 08:22:50] AutomatedTester: and then waits for it to load from cache
[2015-05-27 08:23:07] cptjesus: If you create a new driver
[2015-05-27 08:23:11] cptjesus: It'll throw a timeout just fine
[2015-05-27 08:23:21] AutomatedTester: bizarre
[2015-05-27 08:23:22] cptjesus: Its a solution, but it's not a great one
[2015-05-27 08:23:34] cptjesus: Since theres overhead involved with creating a new driver

[2015-05-27 08:30:49] WhereIsMySpoon: could you not reproduce this easily by just setting page load timeout really low
[2015-05-27 08:30:55] cptjesus: Yeah, you can

[2015-05-27 08:31:00] cptjesus: But its not really visible
[2015-05-27 08:31:05] D3M0S: so it might just be a single resource that's slow
[2015-05-27 08:31:05] cptjesus: Unless you have a page that takes a long time to load
[2015-05-27 08:31:09] D3M0S: not sure if that will work for you
[2015-05-27 08:31:37] cptjesus: Testing
[2015-05-27 08:31:49] cptjesus: Nah, loads instantly
[2015-05-27 08:32:01] D3M0S: cptjesus, but you can actually add to this app.

[2015-05-27 08:32:57] D3M0S: so if you want to create a page that takes a long time to load, you can put it on there.
[2015-05-27 08:33:24] D3M0S: tourdedave, do you have a page that takes a long time to load on the-internet?

[2015-05-27 08:34:57] D3M0S: tourdedave, that's a single resource, I don't think it will work for this situation
[2015-05-27 08:35:06] cptjesus: Its also loading almost immediately for me
[2015-05-27 08:35:24] D3M0S: cptjesus, if you watch the networking tab in developer tools, it does have a resource that's lagging
[2015-05-27 08:35:44] cptjesus: Selenium doesn't see it that way though
[2015-05-27 08:36:38] D3M0S: cptjesus, yeah, I played with it a little but I was actually trying to make that resource timeout, making proxy blacklists....I wasn't doing what you are doing.

[2015-05-27 08:54:58] brma: because I'm looking for a tool that will let me increase the latency of resource requests, but by different amounts based on the resource
[2015-05-27 08:55:55] D3M0S: brma, you could do that with the proxy solution tourdedave mentioned earlier
[2015-05-27 08:56:24] brma: I don't think I was in the room at the time
[2015-05-27 08:56:26] D3M0S: also you can use deelay.me with images and other things on a site, specific resources, not just the whole page
[2015-05-27 08:56:27] brma: browsermob?
[2015-05-27 08:56:42] D3M0S: brma, doesn't NEED to be browsermob, but yes

[2015-05-27 08:57:09] AutomatedTester: cptjesus: can you raise a bug with that pastebin for me?
[2015-05-27 08:57:13] AutomatedTester: :newissue
[2015-05-27 08:57:16] brma: yeah, but proxies like browsermob put latency on the entire connection, right?
[2015-05-27 08:57:26] D3M0S: brma, you don't need to do it that way
[2015-05-27 08:57:30] brma: I'd like to say, only the request for myfile.js is slow
[2015-05-27 08:57:36] cptjesus: AutomatedTester, yeah, 1 sec
[2015-05-27 08:57:40] D3M0S: brma, yes that's possible
[2015-05-27 08:57:43] AutomatedTester: cptjesus: awesome thanks
[2015-05-27 08:57:56] cptjesus: http://pastebin.com/VvCYhqzy
[2015-05-27 08:58:00] cptjesus: This is a refined example
[2015-05-27 08:58:01] brma: D3M0S: with browsermob ?
[2015-05-27 08:58:08] cptjesus: Without browsermob
[2015-05-27 08:58:10] D3M0S: brma, https://github.com/adamfisk/LittleProxy
[2015-05-27 08:58:12] cptjesus: Added in timing
[2015-05-27 08:58:16] cptjesus: To show the issue
[2015-05-27 08:58:29] D3M0S: so checkout the serverToProxyResponse, in the documentation
[2015-05-27 08:58:50] D3M0S: the documentation is a little old, I believe the method is now postResponse
[2015-05-27 08:59:04] cptjesus: Can anyone else give that code a whirl to make sure I'm not insane?
[2015-05-27 09:00:02] D3M0S: so basically in pseudo code, if httpobject is httpresponse then httpresponse.getResourceUrl, if resourceUrl == myfile.js then sleep 10000 return httpobject

[2015-05-27 09:05:10] D3M0S: brma, once you've cleanly hooked the proxy into your framework, it makes loads of things possible
[2015-05-27 09:05:25] D3M0S: the hard part is tying that proxy server to that test instance
[2015-05-27 09:05:32] cptjesus: in the meantime, just going to use my silly workaround
[2015-05-27 09:05:36] cptjesus: Thanks for looking into this

Moving forward whats the best approach for writing and deploying tests, the best language to write tests in (from experience) and are there any good easy to follow tutorials out there than can help me movie from the point i am on just now?

[2015-05-27 11:46:40] cptjesus: Finally solved my issues with basic auth
[2015-05-27 11:46:41] gabecase: best language depends on your skillset JoseyPalosy
[2015-05-27 11:47:03] gabecase: most of the major ones have web-driver ports
[2015-05-27 11:47:35] gabecase: Ive seen amazing and awful test suites in many languages
[2015-05-27 11:47:59] JoseyPalosy: thanks gabecase, i come from a web development background and would say php is my go to language , could i use that? do you seen any disadvantages to using it as apposed to a language like java?
[2015-05-27 11:49:23] gabecase: guys whats php web-driver support like?

[2015-05-27 11:49:56] jleyba: not officially supported by selenium
[2015-05-27 11:50:12] jleyba: there are third-party php webdriver clients available
[2015-05-27 11:50:25] gabecase: ah, I see official support reserved for Java, C#, Rub, Python, and Javascript
[2015-05-27 11:50:44] gabecase: there are some php ports out there I see https://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver
[2015-05-27 11:50:53] gabecase: *Ruby
[2015-05-27 11:51:01] jleyba: yeah, if you want php you probably want to go with the facebook version
[2015-05-27 11:51:31] gabecase: JoseyPalosy may be worth checking out the php driver but just realise the officially supported web drivers will generally be easier to find tutorials and support for
[2015-05-27 11:52:03] gabecase: It seems like your looking for the most straight forward path

[2015-05-27 11:54:16] gabecase: Me personally? Ive used the Java and C#  drivers and both worked pretty well and had tons of libraries and support, I currently use the ruby web driver and if your more into dynamic languages its good as well

[2015-05-27 11:56:16] titusfortner: to a large extent, the best binding to use is the one that is in the same language as the developers of the web app you are testing. :)
[2015-05-27 11:57:52] gabecase: yeah choosing the same language that your main development team uses is a much better way to get them to contribute as well
[2015-05-27 11:58:25] gabecase: if you add the barrier of learning a new language to write selenium tests they might be less likely to help

[2015-05-27 12:15:30] D3M0S: I think it will at somepoint, they've kindof seen the error in their ways plus WebDriver is in or mostly in the W3C spec now
[2015-05-27 12:16:08] D3M0S: so it should take some minimal tweaking to provide support

[2015-05-27 12:20:21] JoseyPalosy: nice one!
[2015-05-27 12:22:39] JoseyPalosy: In addition to this method we have also added one called displayed?. This is the same thing as element_present? but modified to make sure that an element is visible within the browser. This distinction is important since an element can be present without it being visible.
[2015-05-27 12:22:55] JoseyPalosy: this would xplain why many of my ide tests fail lol
