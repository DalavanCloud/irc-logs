[2015-05-04 06:51:35] bimmelino: @Dave_B suggestion is more clean. however it requires more calls to selenium server.

[2015-05-04 10:37:56] dude-x: selenium is slow...

[2015-05-04 10:41:16] asxbr: with selenium i dont need to care with it. The developers should fix the site to implement the change
[2015-05-04 10:41:25] asxbr: and my code will still work

[2015-05-04 11:03:45] jleyba: eindoofus, break it up into multiple queries

[2015-05-04 11:04:20] grepped: jleyba: Awesome, I'll try that out. thanks for the help
[2015-05-04 11:04:24] eindoofus: nice :). didn't know that was possible :)
[2015-05-04 11:05:06] jleyba: eindoofus, yup.. an unlike xpath, using css on a WebElement will always use the WebElement as the search root
[2015-05-04 11:07:31] grepped: jleyba: That's working but it's giving me an object with closure_uids etc, how would i get string output from that command?
[2015-05-04 11:07:32] eindoofus: jleyba, in the end though that looks like what i'm already doing. why doesn't it work as is already?
[2015-05-04 11:08:17] jleyba: grepped, Are you unwrapping the promise?   getCookie('foo').then(function(cookie) {...})
[2015-05-04 11:09:12] grepped: jleyba: Nope I wasn't. that's it, working perfectly :)

[2015-05-04 15:36:06] behbeh: hi folks, I need some pointers on webdriver troubleshooting. I run 400 tests and firehost blows up at least once with "Session [] was terminated due to TIMEOUT"
[2015-05-04 15:36:37] behbeh: it only happens with firefox (latest that selenium 2.45 supports) and it has been happening for a few months now.
[2015-05-04 15:37:05] behbeh: I'm really lost on where to look or what to look for. the exception is at random times in random places
[2015-05-04 15:37:31] behbeh: the server has ample memory and CPU and I watch it so it doesn't run out
[2015-05-04 15:39:23] fabrice31_, quitting. (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[2015-05-04 15:47:18] MonkeysPaw: behbeh: Any chance you aren't quitting the browser instance after each test?
[2015-05-04 15:48:24] behbeh: it's happening in the middle of the tests, at random places, I don't think it's quitting...
[2015-05-04 15:49:44] MonkeysPaw: behbeh: Right, but are you including a driver.quit() at the end of each test or have driver.quit set as a tear down method that runs after each test is called?
[2015-05-04 15:50:33] dimacus, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-05-04 15:52:07] behbeh: the tests are organized in groups and I call quit after each group. Then the next group starts, and halfway through the group it times out.
[2015-05-04 15:53:15] MonkeysPaw: You have multiple tests running in each method?
[2015-05-04 15:55:11] swampdragons, leaving. (#selenium)
[2015-05-04 15:55:15] matt-b: 1/quit
[2015-05-04 15:59:00] behbeh: it's serial, one test at a time
[2015-05-04 15:59:40] MonkeysPaw: I would try calling quit after every test.
[2015-05-04 15:59:50] MonkeysPaw: Instead of after every group of tests.
[2015-05-04 16:00:24] behbeh: I wish there was a way to find out what's going wrong. webdriver doesn't show anything weird going on.
[2015-05-04 16:01:51] MonkeysPaw: If it appears random, different tests fail every time, that makes me think you have a memory related problem.
[2015-05-04 16:02:10] MonkeysPaw: Which leads me back to quitting the tests.

[2015-05-04 16:05:23] behbeh: that could be it - java?
[2015-05-04 16:07:28] MonkeysPaw: behbeh: yeah, I use java. For example, with TestNG I have a set up method @BeforeMethod Setup() that declares the webdriver driver and a tear down method @AfterMethod TearDown(){driver.quit()}. That way the driver is created and destroyed after each test is run.

[2015-05-04 16:08:27] behbeh: I use python, but I was wondering if the node might have memory problems? I have watched its utilization but maybe not closely enough.
[2015-05-04 16:08:46] MonkeysPaw: What it sounds like you are doing is instantiating the webdriver, using and re-using it for a group of tests. And I think it's pitching a memory fit.
[2015-05-04 16:09:03] behbeh: hmmm I'll check on that, thanks!
[2015-05-04 16:09:15] MonkeysPaw: But I'm also fairly new here, so someone else may have a better idea.
[2015-05-04 16:09:30] MonkeysPaw: time to wrap up on my end and go home. Best of luck!
