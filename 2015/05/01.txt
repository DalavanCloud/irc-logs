[2015-05-01 10:44:00] jleyba: same comment @ line 52
[2015-05-01 10:44:34] eindoofus_: jleyba, a bit new to Actions. i was thinking so. i mean i need to continue to clickAndHold while i move the slider
[2015-05-01 10:45:18] eindoofus_: jleya, however, it definitely does not work as expected. it'll continue to move right or left for a bit before it corrects itself
[2015-05-01 10:45:26] jleyba: Actions is a builder, calling build().perform() does not clear the builder's state
[2015-05-01 10:46:02] jleyba: so if your while() runs 3 times, your chain would be:  clickAndHold().moveByOffset().moveByOffset().moveByOffset().moveByOffset()

[2015-05-01 14:15:17] bbarke: Was there ever a way to slow down the execution speed of selenium, for demo purposes to show a room full of people selenium clicking around at a pace they can see. I thought there was once, but I might be thinking of the avoided implicitlyWait function
[2015-05-01 14:18:33] kyoob: selenium rc had a setSpeed method
[2015-05-01 14:18:51] bbarke: ah, maybe that is what I'm thinking of
[2015-05-01 14:19:29] kyoob: yeah, webdriver dropped that

[2015-05-01 14:53:00] D3M0S: next time I take over a framework that wraps webdriver I'm going to commit suicide.
[2015-05-01 14:53:16] D3M0S: WHY!!!
[2015-05-01 14:53:46] dude-x: D3M0S: you use raw webdriver calls in your tests?

[2015-05-01 15:03:08] D3M0S: I'll make generics if they're warranted for specific "Page Objects" which are more objects in a page.

[2015-05-01 15:07:12] dude-x: like to get an element and wait until the element is present
[2015-05-01 15:08:14] tony2, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-05-01 15:08:25] D3M0S: yeah, I'll have like a wait utility that makes writing some of those waits easier, but that isn't what I'd consider wrapping the driver
[2015-05-01 15:10:24] dude-x: you mean like a framework that provides it's own test runner, it's own way to set up tests, it's own idioms to interact with elements?
[2015-05-01 15:11:15] D3M0S: basically something like public class SillyDriver extends WebDriver
[2015-05-01 15:11:30] dude-x: oh
[2015-05-01 15:13:12] D3M0S: then having SillyDriver do all kinds of crap to the WebDriver methods and hooking it into the framework as a WebDriver object

[2015-05-01 15:15:24] dude-x: from that point of view, that does make things more complicated
[2015-05-01 15:15:54] D3M0S: so when you unhook the SillyDriver and replace it with any regular driver it completly breaks everything.  Then basically having a bunch of Weird Page Objectesque behviourisms in the framework that depend on the SillyDriver methods
[2015-05-01 15:16:33] D3M0S: basically taking WebDriver and turning it into the swiss-army-knife antipattern, is the best way I can describe it
[2015-05-01 15:16:49] D3M0S: it's terrible.  I'm basically going to have to throw this entire thing out.
[2015-05-01 15:16:58] dude-x: even when i worked in Java webdriver tests, my team didn't do anything silly like that
