[2015-05-19 06:37:15] kyoob: i want to watch failures happen, and i've never done it before
[2015-05-19 06:37:42] WhereIsMySpoon: kyoob: you can easily integrate screenshot on failure into your tests
[2015-05-19 06:37:47] WhereIsMySpoon: you can also just run them locally
[2015-05-19 06:37:50] WhereIsMySpoon: and watch htem
[2015-05-19 06:37:51] WhereIsMySpoon: them*
[2015-05-19 06:38:08] kyoob: yeah, they pass locally
[2015-05-19 06:38:14] WhereIsMySpoon: i would imagine that with something like jenkins though it should be easy to set a recorder going on the display that the tests are running on
[2015-05-19 06:38:29] WhereIsMySpoon: kyoob: if you paste the error message here we might be able to help :)
[2015-05-19 06:38:55] kyoob: i think i want to run a screen recorder from CI and save the file to google drive
[2015-05-19 06:39:10] WhereIsMySpoon: sounds easy enough
[2015-05-19 06:39:30] kyoob: oh, it's just No Such Element, waiting for a status icon to change into a checkmark
[2015-05-19 06:39:33] WhereIsMySpoon: just run a series of shell commands using your CI thing
[2015-05-19 06:40:07] kyoob: it works locally but i don't know why it's failing on the CI agent. maybe an orphaned open window from a previous test, i dunno

[2015-05-19 06:43:51] kyoob: @afterMethod also clears test data, cookies, etc. each login is fresh
[2015-05-19 06:43:55] WhereIsMySpoon: and we can look
[2015-05-19 06:44:12] kyoob: really, i don't know if it will help.  it's systemic. you'd need to see a lot of it
[2015-05-19 06:44:23] kyoob: thanks though
[2015-05-19 06:44:33] WhereIsMySpoon: kyoob: just the bit that looks at the element would be fine
[2015-05-19 06:46:11] kyoob: that bit is the same wrapper every other test is using to find an element, and they're all working fine.

[2015-05-19 07:04:48] WhereIsMySpoon: as is running any hackintosh

[2015-05-19 07:05:17] WhereIsMySpoon: mekhami:its totally possible to get osx running
[2015-05-19 07:05:28] jimevans: but yes, you can use different drivers (not provided by the selenium project) for automating against the iOS and android browsers.
[2015-05-19 07:05:32] WhereIsMySpoon: just not as simple as windows or linux

[2015-05-19 08:10:20] ca1ek: hi guyz
[2015-05-19 08:10:45] ca1ek: how can i ignore something selenium found by xpath and search for the next thing that fits this xpath?
[2015-05-19 08:11:20] jimevans: warning: flippant snarky answer ahead!
[2015-05-19 08:11:26] jimevans: ca1ek: use a better xpath.
[2015-05-19 08:11:27] jimevans: :)
[2015-05-19 08:11:36] ca1ek: i cant
[2015-05-19 08:11:45] jimevans: betcha can :)
[2015-05-19 08:11:46] ca1ek: even the one i use took me a lot to make
[2015-05-19 08:11:53] ca1ek: it can return many entries
[2015-05-19 08:11:58] ca1ek: because thats what its supposed to do
[2015-05-19 08:12:27] ca1ek: take a look https://gist.github.com/ca1ek/058e851458c3419db4aa
[2015-05-19 08:12:30] jimevans: but more seriously, you can call findElements() instead of findElement() and simply skip the one you're not interested in.
[2015-05-19 08:13:53] ca1ek: it returns a list of all things that fit the xpath?
[2015-05-19 08:13:59] ca1ek: or an array if you are not python
[2015-05-19 08:14:11] jimevans: yep
[2015-05-19 08:14:47] jimevans: and why you wouldn't look for the class as part of your selector is beyond me, but whatever.
[2015-05-19 08:14:56] ca1ek: wwwait
[2015-05-19 08:15:03] jimevans: err, class "matchOrderWrite"
[2015-05-19 08:15:08] ca1ek: fuck why did i use xpath when i could just find the clas
[2015-05-19 08:15:09] ca1ek: s
[2015-05-19 08:15:11] ca1ek: fuck me
[2015-05-19 08:15:21] ca1ek: thanks for pointing that out
[2015-05-19 08:15:27] ca1ek: +1 optimization point
[2015-05-19 08:15:43] jimevans: forest -> trees. we all do it from time to time.
[2015-05-19 08:15:58] nedo007, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-19 08:16:03] ca1ek: i probably did that
[2015-05-19 08:16:14] ca1ek: because i didn't use anything but xpath in whole code
[2015-05-19 08:16:48] jimevans: finding by xpath is evil and should be killed with fire.
[2015-05-19 08:16:51] jimevans: not really
[2015-05-19 08:17:04] WhereIsMySpoon: ca1ek: xpath is the weakest and most brittle of the find methods
[2015-05-19 08:17:08] ca1ek: it was simplest for me until this part
[2015-05-19 08:17:10] jimevans: but it's so easy to misuse
[2015-05-19 08:17:11] WhereIsMySpoon: in my opinion
[2015-05-19 08:17:14] WhereIsMySpoon: "simplest"?
[2015-05-19 08:17:15] WhereIsMySpoon: wut
[2015-05-19 08:17:18] WhereIsMySpoon: idontevenwut
[2015-05-19 08:17:21] ca1ek: i just used the firepath browser extension
[2015-05-19 08:17:25] ca1ek: and pasted xpath into code
[2015-05-19 08:17:30] WhereIsMySpoon: great
[2015-05-19 08:17:36] WhereIsMySpoon: so now you have a) xpath and b) xpath you dont understand
[2015-05-19 08:17:45] ca1ek: oh wait
[2015-05-19 08:17:45] WhereIsMySpoon: thumbs up
[2015-05-19 08:17:52] ca1ek: nope
[2015-05-19 08:17:55] ca1ek: class wont work
[2015-05-19 08:18:04] WhereIsMySpoon: copy-pasting code is the worst way to code

[2015-05-19 08:20:16] nedo007: hello, is there a way to set a timeout on webdriver's creation?
[2015-05-19 08:20:19] nedo007: in python?
[2015-05-19 08:20:32] jimevans: nedo007: i'm not sure i understand the question.
[2015-05-19 08:20:38] nedo007: i have a strange situation where google-chrome doesn't start all the time
[2015-05-19 08:20:51] nedo007: and the program just hangs and waits for chrome to start for 30 or so seconds
[2015-05-19 08:21:06] nedo007: self.display = Display(visible=1, size=(800, 600))
[2015-05-19 08:21:08] nedo007:         self.display.start()
[2015-05-19 08:21:09] nedo007:         self.driver = webdriver.Chrome('/usr/local/bin/chromedriver')
[2015-05-19 08:21:12] nedo007: i have something like this
[2015-05-19 08:21:13] WhereIsMySpoon: dont paste code here
[2015-05-19 08:21:14] WhereIsMySpoon: :gist
[2015-05-19 08:21:15] ca1ek: dont paste in irc
[2015-05-19 08:21:21] nedo007: i know ... it's just 3 lines of code ...
[2015-05-19 08:21:26] ca1ek: too much
[2015-05-19 08:21:31] ca1ek: 3 lines too much
[2015-05-19 08:21:35] nedo007: oh... i remember from other channels that 3 was ok
[2015-05-19 08:21:38] nedo007: my bad
[2015-05-19 08:21:47] ca1ek: not here
[2015-05-19 08:21:50] ca1ek: we actually hate code
[2015-05-19 08:21:54] WhereIsMySpoon: >_>
[2015-05-19 08:21:59] AutomatedTester: 3 lines is fine
[2015-05-19 08:22:03] AutomatedTester: :gist
[2015-05-19 08:22:08] jimevans: i wonder why people prefer xpath to css selectors
[2015-05-19 08:22:20] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: because of things like firebug xpath automatic generators
[2015-05-19 08:22:24] nedo007: http://pastebin.com/6EcdJapt
[2015-05-19 08:22:27] nedo007: i have this code
[2015-05-19 08:22:27] ca1ek: because i don't have firecssselector extenstion!
[2015-05-19 08:22:31] AutomatedTester: jimevans: ancestor locators
[2015-05-19 08:22:33] WhereIsMySpoon: or whatever it is
[2015-05-19 08:22:34] nedo007: that is ran a number of times
[2015-05-19 08:22:43] nedo007: google-chrome doesn't always start
[2015-05-19 08:22:45] jimevans: AutomatedTester: hush, you! :)
[2015-05-19 08:23:14] nedo007: and the rest of the program hangs at the webdriver.chrome() creation
[2015-05-19 08:23:33] nedo007: that code is inside the __init__ of a clas
[2015-05-19 08:23:36] nedo007: class*
[2015-05-19 08:23:39] WhereIsMySpoon: you know you arent the first person over the last few days to complain about chrome hanging
[2015-05-19 08:23:52] WhereIsMySpoon: in conjuction with selenium
[2015-05-19 08:23:53] jimevans: there are three, and only three, situations i can think of where xpath should be used over css selectors.
[2015-05-19 08:24:58] WhereIsMySpoon: nedo007: i mean you could just do a sleep(40000) or smth
[2015-05-19 08:25:05] nedo007: well after the last update i feel like the whole browser has some issues
[2015-05-19 08:25:19] nedo007: sleep? ..
[2015-05-19 08:25:22] nedo007: hmm
[2015-05-19 08:25:25] WhereIsMySpoon: whatever it is in python
[2015-05-19 08:25:38] WhereIsMySpoon: idk i dont code in python
[2015-05-19 08:25:49] nedo007: don't see how that helps as the code hangs at the lie where webdriver is created
[2015-05-19 08:26:00] WhereIsMySpoon: oh right
[2015-05-19 08:26:00] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2015-05-19 08:26:02] WhereIsMySpoon: um
[2015-05-19 08:26:07] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-19 08:26:08] nedo007: and eventually in throws an exception
[2015-05-19 08:26:16] nedo007: line*
[2015-05-19 08:26:29] WhereIsMySpoon: have you tried looking at the chromedriver log/
[2015-05-19 08:26:29] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2015-05-19 08:26:58] nedo007: not really
[2015-05-19 08:27:07] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe u should
[2015-05-19 08:27:08] nedo007: hmm
[2015-05-19 08:27:17] nedo007: yes
[2015-05-19 08:27:23] WhereIsMySpoon: could be some local issue or chrome issue
[2015-05-19 08:27:38] WhereIsMySpoon: nedo007: and i assume chrome itself doesnt hang on startup?
[2015-05-19 08:27:39] nedo007: most likely a chrome issue
[2015-05-19 08:27:43] WhereIsMySpoon: when u normally start it
[2015-05-19 08:27:44] nedo007: no
[2015-05-19 08:27:50] nedo007: when i start it it doesn't
[2015-05-19 08:27:51] WhereIsMySpoon: kk
[2015-05-19 08:28:02] nedo007: it does however not work if i try to run it as root
[2015-05-19 08:28:12] nedo007: and couldn't solve that either
[2015-05-19 08:28:27] nedo007: but it shouldn't matter since i am running it as normal user

[2015-05-19 08:59:43] rorycb: lukeis: that was a tame code review BTW
[2015-05-19 09:00:28] lukeis: heh, glad you think so :)
[2015-05-19 09:00:52] lukeis: (but it's not merged yet! ;) )
[2015-05-19 09:00:55] rorycb: lukeis: I've had much, much worse - and they were all valid concerns - working on a better way to detect our tools
[2015-05-19 09:01:29] rorycb: taking longer than I hoped - my python is quite rusty
[2015-05-19 09:01:59] lukeis: rorycb: for comparison, android usually sets ANDROID_HOME (or sometimes ANDROID_SDK) for the location of it's tools
[2015-05-19 09:02:05] rorycb: lukeis: I am not 100% following the thread on the mailing list either - I am not sure how we would host this sort of code on our own.
[2015-05-19 09:02:17] lukeis: you can do either way
[2015-05-19 09:02:49] lukeis: hosting your own, would mean creating a pypi project and providing some instructions to users on how to also install and use along side selenium
[2015-05-19 09:02:57] rorycb: lukeis: I was going to do that (env vars), and then I realized if you install our WebWorks SDK (vs the NDK) it actually adds our stuff to the PATH
[2015-05-19 09:03:12] lukeis: but then you'd probably also want to do it in Java and Ruby and .NET :)
[2015-05-19 09:03:39] lukeis: going into the selenium project usually means someone will pick up the other pieces though ;)
[2015-05-19 09:03:40] rorycb: lukeis: ruby and java are also ready to go, but I wanted to get this in and reviewed before the other two so I can use the updates
[2015-05-19 09:03:50] lukeis: sounds good
[2015-05-19 09:03:59] rorycb: .NET is the only place I will need help
[2015-05-19 09:04:10] jimevans: i got your back there, rorycb
[2015-05-19 09:04:17] rorycb: jimevans: awesome :) Thanks!
[2015-05-19 09:04:47] rorycb: lukeis: I'd love to say we would host this ourselves, but given it took me a year to get back to this patch I don't have high hopes
[2015-05-19 09:05:11] lukeis: :)
[2015-05-19 09:05:52] *AutomatedTester thinks vendors hosting this part is a silly idea '
[2015-05-19 09:06:05] AutomatedTester: but Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

[2015-05-19 09:06:22] rorycb: lukeis: AutomatedTester I didn't fully get the ask either, but I don't make the rules :)

[2015-05-19 09:07:39] lukeis: not really, we extended our own client
[2015-05-19 09:07:53] lukeis: (extended from seleniumâ€¦ not copy the whole f*ing thing over)
[2015-05-19 09:07:55] AutomatedTester: but then it becomes... Vendor X hates language Y because they dont support it
[2015-05-19 09:08:11] lukeis: i've included some selendroid support into python ;)
[2015-05-19 09:08:55] lukeis: and the point of the selendroid / iosdriver ones are just convenience for some of the capabilities (and maybe a few custom endpoints)...
[2015-05-19 09:09:27] lukeis: custom endpoints though shouldn't live in SeleniumHQ, right?
[2015-05-19 09:10:03] AutomatedTester: an argument could be made eitherway on that

[2015-05-19 09:12:40] WhereIsMySpoon: and even after all that its still wrong sometimes
[2015-05-19 09:13:09] lukeis: we should just leave a big footnoteâ€¦ *We cannot cover all possible cases of element displayedness, please log bugs as you encounter them

[2015-05-19 09:14:14] WhereIsMySpoon: big proposed changes*
[2015-05-19 09:14:42] jimevans: but at least, when isDisplayed returns false when someone things it shouldn't, now we have a stake in the ground we can point to where we say "*this* is what it means to be 'displayed'. if your element doesn't meet that, tfb"
[2015-05-19 09:15:12] WhereIsMySpoon: also what's the timescale for 3.0 roughly?
[2015-05-19 09:15:14] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: 2.0 vs 3.0 is the removal of RC to a separate download. in theory.
[2015-05-19 09:15:21] jimevans: "when it's ready"

[2015-05-19 10:28:02] lukeis: yes
[2015-05-19 10:29:37] lukeis: TPAC in japan!  not sure if i'm gonna swing thatâ€¦ i'd like to, but not sure
[2015-05-19 10:30:12] lukeis: rorycb: this makes me cringeâ€¦. time.sleep(3)  # give the browser time to initialize
[2015-05-19 10:30:16] sircapsalot: how are you guys specifying the hub to run against?  i'm using a free saucelabs hub as well, but i can't seem to figure out how to pass in the hub url secretly.  I've specified the url as a JVM parameter in /etc/init.d/jenkins   , to no avail.     i've looked through the selenium ci and the grid information is nowhere to be found (as designed, of course :)) so my question is, how are you guys passing in the grid url?
[2015-05-19 10:30:22] ca1ek: does chromeDriver work with chromium?
[2015-05-19 10:30:45] rorycb: lukeis: me too. but there is no way around it, at least that I could figure
[2015-05-19 10:30:54] lukeis: yeah, i figured...
[2015-05-19 10:31:09] lukeis: rorycb: in selendroid we can poll the device for it to be 'awake'
[2015-05-19 10:31:49] lukeis: also, you could 'poll'  <url>/status ? (do you guys respond to /status ?)
[2015-05-19 10:32:06] rorycb: lukeis: let me ping a couple people here and see if I can make this better
[2015-05-19 10:32:19] rorycb: I don't know if we respond to /status - but we might
[2015-05-19 10:32:31] rorycb: our stuff is a little lacking, at least that is what I am finding
[2015-05-19 10:33:26] rorycb: lukeis: magic - there maybe a new option we can use, wasn't there before. give me a few

[2015-05-19 10:34:51] lukeis: the username and key are environment variables that are only accessible on the jenkins box
[2015-05-19 10:36:42] sircapsalot: right exactly.. so how are they being set there?  I don't want values.. just "where"?  like i said, i actually tried to specify my own env variable in the /etc/init.d/jenkins script which didn't work, because that's tied to the jenkins instance, not necessarily the individual jobs
[2015-05-19 10:37:02] sircapsalot: I see that it's reading SAUCE_USERNAME.. where is that set? do you know ? :)
[2015-05-19 10:37:13] sircapsalot: i'm not a devops guy :(

[2015-05-19 14:46:54] D3M0S: something I've been wondering for awhile, what is the best way to handle a table like this? http://pastebin.com/wWQ01AfX
[2015-05-19 14:47:23] D3M0S: variable sets of "schedule" and "actual" can be added to the table
[2015-05-19 14:47:34] lukeis: what do you want to do with it?
[2015-05-19 14:47:36] D3M0S: I'm trying to make a page object out of it
[2015-05-19 14:47:52] lukeis: and you should fire the UI developer :)
[2015-05-19 14:47:58] D3M0S: so once I'm actually inside the correct "actual" class, theres other items that I want to garner info from
[2015-05-19 14:48:03] D3M0S: I know right
[2015-05-19 14:48:20] D3M0S: I have limited ability to add identifiers to the DOM
[2015-05-19 14:48:44] D3M0S: but I can't completely switch things around without an enhancment ticket and a near 2 week turn around
[2015-05-19 14:48:52] lukeis: use javascript i suppose, to select the sibling
[2015-05-19 14:48:58] D3M0S: but I can add classnames and id's to my hearts content

[2015-05-19 14:50:45] D3M0S: and then refer to its sibling by grabbing previous?
[2015-05-19 14:50:49] lukeis: sure?

[2015-05-19 14:51:21] lukeis: nah ;)
[2015-05-19 14:51:24] D3M0S: lol
[2015-05-19 14:51:35] D3M0S: its basically, two rows for each "set"
[2015-05-19 14:51:41] *lukeis leaves you to make the best judgement call'
[2015-05-19 14:52:14] D3M0S: I doubt you want to hear more than, I think your idea will work well
[2015-05-19 14:52:27] D3M0S: thanks
[2015-05-19 14:52:35] lukeis: note that the previousSibling thing may work differently cross browser, especially if there's whitespace between the <tr>'s
[2015-05-19 14:53:15] D3M0S: I like this though, I'll add it to my relations class
[2015-05-19 14:53:25] D3M0S: which is all javascript parent sibling mumbo jumbo
[2015-05-19 14:53:52] lukeis: and honestly, i think i would just slurp the full table and put the data into a map, then expose a method that helps read that map
[2015-05-19 14:54:05] lukeis: map / dictionary
[2015-05-19 14:54:41] D3M0S: is there a way to do that? like pull the html tree into a json object then ObjectMapper that into a fancy class? or am I overthinking it?
[2015-05-19 14:54:59] lukeis: i would write it in javascript :)
[2015-05-19 14:55:07] D3M0S: I'm such shit at js
[2015-05-19 14:56:02] D3M0S: I can like...hardly read it, and slap together some little one-off js executors.

[2015-05-19 15:04:20] D3M0S: yeah, it's more concise for a one off thing, but what if I could build an opensource library that does some magic with the help of a few other tools and then solve it for lots of people
[2015-05-19 15:04:31] D3M0S: its something to think about

[2015-05-19 15:22:52] D3M0S: I had some very very minimal interaction with IDE like 4 years ago
[2015-05-19 15:22:54] INeedSeleniumHel: Customizing the code outputed by the IDE would be the best
[2015-05-19 15:23:09] D3M0S: as in, my co-worker was using it and I told him to switch to WebDriver..
[2015-05-19 15:23:20] bbarke, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-05-19 15:24:26] INeedSeleniumHel: lol
[2015-05-19 15:24:28] D3M0S: I'm not sure it does have that functionality.  But seriously get input from somebody more versed than me in it
[2015-05-19 15:24:36] INeedSeleniumHel: yeah no one else seems to be here
[2015-05-19 15:24:42] D3M0S: they'll come along
[2015-05-19 15:25:10] D3M0S: my experience, whenever somebody asks and IDE question, most everybody goes quiet
[2015-05-19 15:25:11] D3M0S: lol
[2015-05-19 15:25:13] INeedSeleniumHel: yay I found it
[2015-05-19 15:25:15] INeedSeleniumHel: yeah lol
[2015-05-19 15:25:20] D3M0S: well there you go
[2015-05-19 15:25:22] INeedSeleniumHel: I don't see why, it makes everything 10x faster
[2015-05-19 15:25:30] INeedSeleniumHel: why nobody uses it
[2015-05-19 15:26:07] D3M0S: I think it limits control...and people that maintain massive test suites need as much control as possible
[2015-05-19 15:26:20] D3M0S: maintainability becomes your #1 priority
[2015-05-19 15:26:26] INeedSeleniumHel: yeah that makes sense
[2015-05-19 15:26:34] INeedSeleniumHel: I guess most people that use it for massive projects?
[2015-05-19 15:26:47] INeedSeleniumHel: wow my English is way off today
[2015-05-19 15:26:58] D3M0S: yes, a lot use it to automate testing of entire websites
[2015-05-19 15:27:03] INeedSeleniumHel: and I'm a native English speaker haha
[2015-05-19 15:27:05] D3M0S: with thousands of testcases
[2015-05-19 15:27:08] INeedSeleniumHel: yeah
[2015-05-19 15:27:10] INeedSeleniumHel: that makes sense
[2015-05-19 15:28:08] D3M0S: most of us will recommend IDE if you've only got a couple things to automate
[2015-05-19 15:28:36] INeedSeleniumHel: I want to be able to automate things as fluidly as possible
[2015-05-19 15:28:52] D3M0S: how much automation do you need to do?
[2015-05-19 15:28:56] D3M0S: like use cases?
[2015-05-19 15:29:08] INeedSeleniumHel: not much
[2015-05-19 15:29:18] INeedSeleniumHel: just a few logins and actions on websites
[2015-05-19 15:29:32] D3M0S: ah ok, then IDE should service you fine
[2015-05-19 15:29:53] D3M0S: if you go over 10 or so, I'd seriously consider moving to WebDriver
[2015-05-19 15:30:00] D3M0S: and page object pattern
[2015-05-19 15:30:24] D3M0S: well like 10-25 you dont really need page object pattern
[2015-05-19 15:30:36] D3M0S: 25+ you should be using page object pattern
[2015-05-19 15:30:55] INeedSeleniumHel: I do use webdriver
[2015-05-19 15:31:06] INeedSeleniumHel: and what is page object pattern?
[2015-05-19 15:31:22] D3M0S: its a way of defining your locators in page objects
[2015-05-19 15:31:32] D3M0S: so you don't constantly rewrite the code to find webelements
[2015-05-19 15:31:36] D3M0S: but it becomes much much more
[2015-05-19 15:31:54] D3M0S: like defining actions off of webelements and things
[2015-05-19 15:32:32] D3M0S: so say you have 2 tests, that use a login page, each test "finds" the username field and does sendkeys to it
[2015-05-19 15:33:01] D3M0S: but if something happens where that username field changes, then you need to modify both tests to fix the thing that changed
[2015-05-19 15:33:07] INeedSeleniumHel: yeah I've written code like that previous
[2015-05-19 15:33:14] INeedSeleniumHel: a "library" if you want to call it that
[2015-05-19 15:33:25] INeedSeleniumHel: previously*
[2015-05-19 15:33:31] D3M0S: exactly, page object help you define that username field into a common code location
[2015-05-19 15:33:42] D3M0S: so you only need to fix it in one place instead of two
[2015-05-19 15:33:42] INeedSeleniumHel: yeah, I can do that with the IDE
[2015-05-19 15:33:51] INeedSeleniumHel: yeah
[2015-05-19 15:35:01] D3M0S: but the page object api has some conventions and helpers to locate those elements which makes it much cleaner than just manually building a library
[2015-05-19 15:36:06] D3M0S: if your Page Object Pattern libarary is really well put together, you can write tests incredibly fast...which is probably why most don't bother with IDE past a certian point
[2015-05-19 15:37:10] D3M0S: for example, this is my login code:  loginPage.username("foo").password("bar").submit()
[2015-05-19 15:38:50] D3M0S: this navigates to a table describing an employee, hits the edit button and modifies the phonenumber field:
[2015-05-19 15:38:51] D3M0S: mainEmployee.getEmployeeTable().getEmployee(employee.getEmployeeNumber()).clickEditEmployeeButton()
[2015-05-19 15:38:51] D3M0S:         .phoneNumber1(mockPhone1).clickSaveButton();
[2015-05-19 15:40:02] INeedSeleniumHel: yeah I need to check out the page object api lol
[2015-05-19 15:40:15] D3M0S: see how readable the tests become too?
[2015-05-19 15:40:23] D3M0S: probably a world better than what the IDE spits out
[2015-05-19 15:41:15] INeedSeleniumHel: yeah
[2015-05-19 15:41:21] INeedSeleniumHel: you've made me change my mind
[2015-05-19 15:41:24] INeedSeleniumHel: thanks lol
[2015-05-19 15:41:26] D3M0S: :)
[2015-05-19 15:41:34] D3M0S: +1 convert
[2015-05-19 15:41:50] INeedSeleniumHel: I'm the kind of programmer that will write hundreds of lines of boilerplate code for something that I could do in 100 lol
[2015-05-19 15:42:01] INeedSeleniumHel: just because it works better
[2015-05-19 15:42:04] D3M0S: Then page object pattern is perfect for you!
[2015-05-19 15:42:06] D3M0S: lol
[2015-05-19 15:42:13] INeedSeleniumHel: yep
[2015-05-19 15:42:25] D3M0S: seriously though, it will feel like that, but theres a few things you should keep in mind
[2015-05-19 15:42:58] D3M0S: your tests should be: Maintainable, Readable, Extensible
[2015-05-19 15:43:17] D3M0S: if you work towards those goals, then you'll save yourself time in the long run
[2015-05-19 15:43:23] D3M0S: and in automation time == money
[2015-05-19 15:43:35] INeedSeleniumHel: yeah
[2015-05-19 15:43:41] jc2121: I'm trying to say if(elementExists){ do stuff }.  How do I determine if an element exists?
[2015-05-19 15:43:52] INeedSeleniumHel: what do I do if the selectors for two different login pages are different?
[2015-05-19 15:44:17] D3M0S: if(driver.findElements(By...).size > 0)
[2015-05-19 15:44:31] jc2121: Ah!  Thanks
[2015-05-19 15:44:41] jc2121: D3M0S: turns out I needed to driver.SwitchTo().DefaultContent() and then do another switch after that: driver.SwitchTo().Frame(driver.FindElement(By.Name("framename")))
[2015-05-19 15:44:51] D3M0S: INeedSeleniumHel, have two different page objects to describe two different login pages
[2015-05-19 15:45:03] jc2121: Yes, model each page.
[2015-05-19 15:46:21] D3M0S: jc2121, glad you figured it out, you should be able to take this part out of your code: driver.FindElement(By.Name("framename")) and replace with: "framename"
[2015-05-19 15:46:58] D3M0S: the .frame() method will automatically search by name or id
[2015-05-19 15:47:16] D3M0S: or according to the api it should
[2015-05-19 15:47:16] jc2121: oh cool
[2015-05-19 15:47:21] jc2121: c#?
[2015-05-19 15:47:35] D3M0S: its the webdriver api, the language shouldnt matter here
[2015-05-19 15:47:48] jc2121: ah
[2015-05-19 15:50:59] INeedSeleniumHel: I like this a lot, D3M0S
[2015-05-19 15:51:09] INeedSeleniumHel: I'm trying to come up with a way to check for a login
[2015-05-19 15:51:25] INeedSeleniumHel: maybe a method checking for a cookie and then defining the name of the cookie on sub-classes?

[2015-05-19 15:54:05] INeedSeleniumHel: oh god I'm gunna make this even more awesome
[2015-05-19 15:54:50] D3M0S: INeedSeleniumHel, yeah, its really cool...keep this in mind
[2015-05-19 15:55:06] INeedSeleniumHel: I will :)
[2015-05-19 15:55:09] D3M0S: Page Object Pattern should be a class that describes your Pages
[2015-05-19 15:55:26] D3M0S: but its not against the rules to make Page Objects out of subsections of your pages
[2015-05-19 15:55:34] D3M0S: especially for parts of your site that look like they're reused
[2015-05-19 15:56:00] D3M0S: so you can have "Objects in a Page" or a Page Object comprised of multiple Page Objects
[2015-05-19 15:56:16] INeedSeleniumHel: well I was thinking of creating a way to reuse a login if there's already a cookie in the webdriver
[2015-05-19 15:56:21] INeedSeleniumHel: so I don't have to relogin
[2015-05-19 15:56:38] D3M0S: I've seen lots of people start and make classes taht are like 4000 lines long, because they have one object that describes a page, and never thought to pull out peices of that page into their own class
[2015-05-19 15:56:52] INeedSeleniumHel: and I'm not quite sure what you mean by that, can you give me a basic example of "Objects in a Page" and "a Page Object comprised of multiple Page Objects"
[2015-05-19 15:57:08] D3M0S: sure, do you have a favorite website we can look at?
[2015-05-19 15:57:16] INeedSeleniumHel: hmm
[2015-05-19 15:57:21] INeedSeleniumHel: Amazon, for example
[2015-05-19 15:57:24] D3M0S: ok
[2015-05-19 15:57:37] D3M0S: so right off the bat
[2015-05-19 15:57:39] INeedSeleniumHel: just give me basic method and class names
[2015-05-19 15:57:51] D3M0S: lets pretend were defining amazon.com
[2015-05-19 15:57:58] D3M0S: so we have a HomePage Object
[2015-05-19 15:58:16] D3M0S: so lets click on the Todays Deals link
[2015-05-19 15:58:19] D3M0S: in the header

[2015-05-19 15:58:30] gabel, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-05-19 15:58:38] D3M0S: so were going to have a HomePage, and a TodaysDealsPage
[2015-05-19 15:58:42] D3M0S: those are 2 objects
[2015-05-19 15:58:49] D3M0S: but theres a similarity between those 2 pages
[2015-05-19 15:58:52] D3M0S: the header
[2015-05-19 15:58:58] D3M0S: so we should have a Header page object
[2015-05-19 15:59:16] D3M0S: and both the HomePage and the TodaysDealsPage inherit or get composed with the Header object
[2015-05-19 15:59:25] D3M0S: so you don't write stuff from the header in both pages
[2015-05-19 15:59:34] INeedSeleniumHel: oh yeah that's basically what I'm doing
[2015-05-19 15:59:44] INeedSeleniumHel: creating a parent class for all repeated code
[2015-05-19 15:59:57] D3M0S: so look at the varous pages in your site...and try to pull out objects visually
[2015-05-19 16:00:17] D3M0S: when you inspect the dom, you can usually tell theres different parts of the page with different purposes
[2015-05-19 16:00:33] D3M0S: so define your page objects around actions on those subsections of the page
[2015-05-19 16:01:10] oida, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-19 16:01:31] D3M0S: so within the Header, I might have another page object called SearchBar, and in SearchBar I could have a method doSearch(String searchTerm)
[2015-05-19 16:01:49] D3M0S: and that method uses the search bar element to sendkeys, and the search button to click
[2015-05-19 16:02:16] D3M0S: you can...and probably should, keep your elements private, and only have actual actions publicly accessable
[2015-05-19 16:02:41] INeedSeleniumHel: ah ok
[2015-05-19 16:02:50] INeedSeleniumHel: I'm not sure if I need THAT much functionality lol
[2015-05-19 16:04:06] D3M0S: so if you do that, you can end up with a test like homePage.getHeader().doSearch("Hello Kitty"); nice and neat
[2015-05-19 16:04:49] D3M0S: further you can chain what you return so you could have it do SearchPage searchPage = homePage.getHeader().doSearch("Hello Kitty");
[2015-05-19 16:05:40] D3M0S: anyways, thats a good primer, and you can make them as complex or simple as you need them to be
[2015-05-19 16:06:07] INeedSeleniumHel: yeah I'll keep it in mind
[2015-05-19 16:06:08] D3M0S: but it constrains all that logic into a central place, and keeps your test logic nice and clean, and more importantly, maintainable
[2015-05-19 16:06:09] INeedSeleniumHel: thanks for your help
[2015-05-19 16:06:18] D3M0S: no problem, enjoy
[2015-05-19 16:06:32] D3M0S: I'm off for the night, I'll be back tomorrow if you have more questions
[2015-05-19 16:06:59] INeedSeleniumHel: okay, cya, and I'll let you know if I do :D
