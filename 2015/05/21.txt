[2015-05-21 01:58:30] v_v: i got 2 problems:

[2015-05-21 01:59:25] v_v: 1. script like "page=require('webpage')" can run from cli 'phantomjs a.js' (a.js contain the script). when called by selenium webdriver.execute_script(), it has no object 'page', and 'require' is not defined.
[2015-05-21 02:00:37] v_v: 2. any way to monitoring the actions i care about ? so far, i found a example of network monitoring, which i don't know how to make it work from selenium

[2015-05-21 03:20:33] extor: bimmelino if you don't mind me asking, what is it that phantomJS can do that selenium alone cannot do?
[2015-05-21 03:21:23] extor: barencev that was supposed to be directed at you, sorry
[2015-05-21 03:21:30] barancev: extor: selenium is just a driver for phantomjs, as well as firefox, chrome, opera etc
[2015-05-21 03:21:55] barancev: think of phantomjs as a headless browser
[2015-05-21 03:22:17] extor: SO selenium lacks the ability to run headlessly
[2015-05-21 03:22:49] barancev: selenium is not a browser
[2015-05-21 03:22:53] extor: Sorry I'm a selenium noob, just got my hands on two video tutorials on it which I should have crammed into my head today in their entirety
[2015-05-21 03:22:55] barancev: it is a driver for browsers
[2015-05-21 03:23:02] bimmelino: @extor: two reasons are speed and less hardware required
[2015-05-21 03:23:08] extor: yes I gather selenium is an API orchestrator for firefox
[2015-05-21 03:23:26] barancev: selenium can driver any browser, not only firefox
[2015-05-21 03:23:40] barancev: and it can drive phantomjs as well
[2015-05-21 03:23:52] extor: barancev so then phantom pretends to be chrome and selenium drives it, but headlessly?
[2015-05-21 03:24:14] barancev: you're close :)
[2015-05-21 03:24:19] extor: barancev ahh I was thinking of the selenium IDE then, I saw that it was only a firefox product
[2015-05-21 03:24:31] barancev: yes, SeIDE is a firefox addon
[2015-05-21 03:25:18] WhereIsMySpoon: bimmelino, extor: you can run selenium headlessly without needing to resort to phantomjs
[2015-05-21 03:25:19] extor: So technically speaking then a practical use of the ghostdriver would be to run 100 simultaneous web client sessions on a VPS which otherwise would crash at 20
[2015-05-21 03:25:50] extor: WhereIsMySpoon then why is it that ghostdriver exists, perhaps it's for people who have existing phantomJS scripts? I am puzzled.
[2015-05-21 03:26:03] barancev: I'd not say phantomjs is so much faster and less memory consuming
[2015-05-21 03:26:12] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: not sure
[2015-05-21 03:26:19] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: but id be wary of using it for web testing
[2015-05-21 03:26:30] WhereIsMySpoon: it doesnt work the same as most browsers and has limitations
[2015-05-21 03:26:35] barancev: extor: read carefully the ghostdriver home page
[2015-05-21 03:26:52] barancev: "GhostDriver is designed to be integral part of PhantomJS itself, but it's developed in isolation and progress is tracked by this Repository."
[2015-05-21 03:27:02] barancev: "integral part of"
[2015-05-21 03:27:23] extor: WhereIsMySpoon I was only considering it for web automation. Logging in and posting to sites as well as signing up. However, I do not have enough knowledge of either phantom or selenium to grasp the differences and commonalities et
[2015-05-21 03:27:45] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: ok, separate in your mind phantomjs and selenium
[2015-05-21 03:28:01] WhereIsMySpoon: in the realm of selenium, phantomjs is the same as chrome and firefox and IE
[2015-05-21 03:28:08] WhereIsMySpoon: it is a platform to run your tests on
[2015-05-21 03:28:08] barancev: phantomjs provides various external APIs, ghostdriver is one of them, the WebDriver compatible one
[2015-05-21 03:28:15] extor: WhereIsMySpoon yeah that will happen automatically once I get off my butt and actually learn about their features
[2015-05-21 03:28:29] WhereIsMySpoon: eh, ghostdriver more accurately, not phamtomjs
[2015-05-21 03:28:38] WhereIsMySpoon: but yea
[2015-05-21 03:28:53] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: i dont recommend ghostdriver for selenium
[2015-05-21 03:29:37] extor: WhereIsMySpoon you don't recommend it for what reason, because it's absolutely pointless or because there is a better option to bridge the two apps
[2015-05-21 03:29:49] WhereIsMySpoon: because there are issues with it
[2015-05-21 03:30:05] WhereIsMySpoon: for one thing, how many of your clients are using ghostdriver to browse the web?
[2015-05-21 03:30:12] WhereIsMySpoon: they arent, theyre using chrome or firefox or IE
[2015-05-21 03:30:15] extor: It almost sounds like a gimmick to me like cygwin..."hey this works its so cool did you think this was not possible guys" type of thing
[2015-05-21 03:30:27] WhereIsMySpoon: so from the start you're testing on a platform your clients arent using
[2015-05-21 03:30:35] WhereIsMySpoon: secondly it uses a different JS engine from other browsers
[2015-05-21 03:31:02] extor: Well to be fair phantomJS can probably be configured to be similar to a mobile browser, did you think of that?
[2015-05-21 03:31:04] WhereIsMySpoon: thirdly there are several basic things it cant do, like handle alerts for example
[2015-05-21 03:31:16] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: id rather use one of the drivers that have been developed for mobile..
[2015-05-21 03:31:22] WhereIsMySpoon: there are ios and android drivers
[2015-05-21 03:31:29] barancev: "similar to" is the key
[2015-05-21 03:31:37] WhereIsMySpoon: chrome is "similar to" firefox
[2015-05-21 03:31:52] WhereIsMySpoon: for various lengths of "similar"
[2015-05-21 03:32:00] WhereIsMySpoon: 1 is similar to 2
[2015-05-21 03:32:12] ArSn, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-21 03:32:18] WhereIsMySpoon: you want your tests to be reliable and trustworthy
[2015-05-21 03:32:19] extor: So why do people use phantomJS to begin with, by itself? How does it stand apart, what does it bring to the table? Must be something...
[2015-05-21 03:32:23] WhereIsMySpoon: and test what your clients are using
[2015-05-21 03:32:44] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: because it doesnt require a head and people are too lazy to do the small work required to run normal browsers headlessly
[2015-05-21 03:32:58] extor: Or is it just a toy made by Arya for his own personal pleasure and persuits
[2015-05-21 03:33:15] extor: Oh ok...so phantomJS is a gimmick
[2015-05-21 03:33:16] WhereIsMySpoon: or because for some reason the only test nodes they have are macs
[2015-05-21 03:33:22] WhereIsMySpoon: i wouldnt go that far
[2015-05-21 03:33:28] WhereIsMySpoon: for selenium I dont think its a good solution
[2015-05-21 03:33:33] WhereIsMySpoon: for other domains, i dont know
[2015-05-21 03:34:05] WhereIsMySpoon: im sure it has its uses for other problem domains
[2015-05-21 03:34:06] extor: Well phantom may have good access to DOM manipulation or Xpath manipulation. Who knows. I'll be honest, I'm ignorant.
[2015-05-21 03:34:22] WhereIsMySpoon: i doubt any more than any other browser
[2015-05-21 03:34:26] WhereIsMySpoon: so am i :)
[2015-05-21 03:34:31] WhereIsMySpoon: hence why i said i dont know for other domains
[2015-05-21 03:35:39] extor: I have two goals with selenium, one is to become proficient enough with it to put on my resume and the other is to be able to automate registration, login and scraping/posting to various blog urls and forum urls. On the verge of spamminess but not quite.
[2015-05-21 03:36:10] WhereIsMySpoon: sounds easily doable
[2015-05-21 03:36:23] WhereIsMySpoon: as long as theres no captcha
[2015-05-21 03:36:25] WhereIsMySpoon: ;)
[2015-05-21 03:36:43] WhereIsMySpoon: though tbh most registration nowadays requires email validation
[2015-05-21 03:37:11] WhereIsMySpoon: i guess you could automate that too, using some form of web mail...
[2015-05-21 03:37:40] fabrice31, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-21 03:40:39] extor: pop mail
[2015-05-21 03:40:39] barancev: extor: for the second target (scraping etc) phantomjs fits well
[2015-05-21 03:40:56] extor: Oh so selenium cannot do screen scraping?
[2015-05-21 03:41:02] WhereIsMySpoon: sure it can
[2015-05-21 03:41:06] barancev: because it is headless
[2015-05-21 03:41:07] WhereIsMySpoon: phantomjs will just be faster
[2015-05-21 03:41:41] extor: ahh not sure I want to go multithreaded but then again why not run 20 to 50 instances if possible
[2015-05-21 03:42:53] extor: I'm doing this on C# btw which I know the syntax of somewhat but was also consideing visual C++ since .NET hads a reputation of being unstable at high velocity
[2015-05-21 03:43:32] WhereIsMySpoon: there are no c++ bindings for selenium afaik
[2015-05-21 03:43:41] extor: And the captcha I would just throw at myself as a popup or something, that hurdle can be solved I'm sure. Might even use paid captcha solving APIs
[2015-05-21 03:43:54] barancev: you can run a task with phantomjs in background and continue useing your computer normally, phantomjs will not interfere with you
[2015-05-21 03:44:01] extor: ok well C# it is then, no need to get fancy just to feel l33t
[2015-05-21 03:44:19] barancev: unlike a regular browser
[2015-05-21 03:44:33] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: the major bindings are :docs
[2015-05-21 03:44:36] WhereIsMySpoon: :api
[2015-05-21 03:44:40] extor: barancev but that task of phantomJS will be orchestrated by ghostdriver I take it, in fact maybe multiple threads of it
[2015-05-21 03:44:40] WhereIsMySpoon: ^ those
[2015-05-21 03:45:35] extor: net java ruby python and JS...everything is going JS these days it seems. thisJS and thatJS popping up all over the place
[2015-05-21 03:45:37] barancev: with a regular browser you have to use a VM or dring coffee while it is running
[2015-05-21 03:46:15] epteixeira1, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-21 03:46:20] extor: barancev yes however I think you or WhereIsMySpoon mentioned earlier that selenium can also run headless browser stubs
[2015-05-21 03:46:28] WhereIsMySpoon: not quite
[2015-05-21 03:46:39] WhereIsMySpoon: what you do is run xvfb and direct the drivers to run on it

[2015-05-21 03:47:01] WhereIsMySpoon: then you dont need a head
[2015-05-21 03:47:01] barancev: extor: remember one simple thing -- selenium is a DRIVER
[2015-05-21 03:47:09] WhereIsMySpoon: you will need X though ofc :)
[2015-05-21 03:47:14] barancev: it is your browser that is headless or not
[2015-05-21 03:47:14] extor: Ahh so phantomJS might be a useful addon to my scheme
[2015-05-21 03:47:20] WhereIsMySpoon: what barancev said
[2015-05-21 03:47:50] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium couldnt care less if u use a banana driver
[2015-05-21 03:48:03] extor: yeah phantomJS is probably more "specialized" at doing acrobatics than native firefox. I think I understand.
[2015-05-21 03:48:05] WhereIsMySpoon: as long as it implements the correct api protocols
[2015-05-21 03:49:59] extor: In industry when people typically use selenium for testing, are they throwing a lot of selenium threads at the web server URL usually or how does it work?
[2015-05-21 03:50:10] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: look up Grid
[2015-05-21 03:50:28] barancev: and virtualization
[2015-05-21 03:50:44] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: in a nutshell, you run a Grid server. you then have several "node" machines that will have the browser drivers on them. Grid allows you to (KEY word allows) distribute selenium tasks
[2015-05-21 03:50:51] WhereIsMySpoon: you still have to manage the threading of job creation
[2015-05-21 03:51:04] WhereIsMySpoon: but when you pipe the jobs to Grid it will distribute them to registered nodes
[2015-05-21 03:51:33] pixelport, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-21 03:51:42] WhereIsMySpoon: you use the same jar to run a grid hub as you do to run a grid node
[2015-05-21 03:51:47] WhereIsMySpoon: only difference is the arguments u give it to start
[2015-05-21 03:51:48] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2015-05-21 03:53:53] extor: the threading of job creation is a C# skill I take it
[2015-05-21 03:54:31] WhereIsMySpoon: or you can get a test runner that will do it for you
[2015-05-21 03:54:36] extor: Or has selenium written the code for me so I don't have to think or design multithreading, it just does it for me in the form of a pre existing template
[2015-05-21 03:54:43] extor: Oh boy this is too easy then
[2015-05-21 03:54:47] WhereIsMySpoon: no
[2015-05-21 03:54:52] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium does not deal with multithreading
[2015-05-21 03:54:53] WhereIsMySpoon: at all
[2015-05-21 03:55:10] extor: What on earth was I learning Awesomium for when Selenium can do all this?
[2015-05-21 03:55:13] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium does selenium stuff, you need to use a test framework to manage and run your tests
[2015-05-21 03:55:16] *extor facepalms'
[2015-05-21 03:55:36] WhereIsMySpoon: i have no idea what that is
[2015-05-21 03:55:40] WhereIsMySpoon: but i dunno
[2015-05-21 03:56:20] extor: Awesomium is a webkit driver that can also run headlessly or like a browser. BUt it's documentation and tutorials are horrible so me being a noob had trouble with it
[2015-05-21 03:56:41] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2015-05-21 03:57:07] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: are you a software dev?
[2015-05-21 03:57:17] extor: So Selenium doesn't package a test framework with itself. I guess I should just crash course my way through the video tutorials I have for selenium
[2015-05-21 03:57:39] extor: WhereIsMySpoon my background is a system admin/tech support and I am just starting to get into software dev
[2015-05-21 03:58:09] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: no it doesnt, selenium tries to be (and continues to try to be) as slim as possible an pi
[2015-05-21 03:58:10] WhereIsMySpoon: api*
[2015-05-21 03:58:32] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium is an api you use to solve problems, it isnt an all in one packages
[2015-05-21 03:58:36] WhereIsMySpoon: package*
[2015-05-21 03:58:37] barancev: extor: Awesomium is one API to WebKit, Selenium WebDriver is another API
[2015-05-21 03:59:01] barancev: if you want WebKit -- you can choose any you like
[2015-05-21 03:59:14] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: cool, well i dont know how long it will take for you, but for me as a software dev it took really only a week or so to get used to selenium and start writing tests
[2015-05-21 03:59:32] WhereIsMySpoon: and that only because i was doing other stuff for more than half of that week anyway
[2015-05-21 03:59:40] extor: I don't necessarily need webkit, just anything that can emulate a browser will do as long as it can render JS, CSS etc
[2015-05-21 03:59:41] WhereIsMySpoon: its quite straightforward
[2015-05-21 03:59:49] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: again, selenium is NOT the browser
[2015-05-21 03:59:58] WhereIsMySpoon: nor does it have anything to do with emulation
[2015-05-21 04:00:13] WhereIsMySpoon: it drives what the browser does
[2015-05-21 04:00:26] extor: right I know, but I was responding to barancev who assumed I needed webkit specifically for my goals. I do not.
[2015-05-21 04:00:57] WhereIsMySpoon: and you wont be emulating a browser, you will be running the actual browser
[2015-05-21 04:01:08] extor: Oh boy a week is a long time. Still, I have to master selenium. Will try to crash course my way tomorrow using the video lessons
[2015-05-21 04:01:13] WhereIsMySpoon: you just need chromedriver/firefoxdriver/etc to launch it so that it can intercept selenium commands
[2015-05-21 04:01:35] extor: Yes I will be running an actual browser through APIs unless I am running phantomjs or webkit through some plugin
[2015-05-21 04:01:38] WhereIsMySpoon: a week isnt a long time, as i said i wasnt doing straight selenium for 40 hours
[2015-05-21 04:02:01] extor: well a week is a long time for me because I want to start writing code well before the 1st.
[2015-05-21 04:02:20] WhereIsMySpoon: if you've never coded before that expectation is fairly unrealistic
[2015-05-21 04:02:21] extor: Maybe if I work 12 to 16 hours a day I can speed things up
[2015-05-21 04:02:26] WhereIsMySpoon: imo
[2015-05-21 04:02:33] barancev: extor: I bet you'd better go write code with _any_ API instead of spending so much time to select "the best one", that would serve better your golas :)
[2015-05-21 04:02:35] extor: I've written some scripts and some simple programs
[2015-05-21 04:02:43] WhereIsMySpoon: or rather...you may be writing code, but whether it's any good..
[2015-05-21 04:02:57] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: sure, but when you want to learn, its best to learn with an end goal in mind
[2015-05-21 04:03:00] barancev: *goals
[2015-05-21 04:03:08] extor: barancev yes you are correct, I suffer from the disease of indicesion
[2015-05-21 04:03:19] WhereIsMySpoon: but i do agree you should just pick something and start
[2015-05-21 04:03:30] WhereIsMySpoon: rather than procrastinating over niggles like libraries
[2015-05-21 04:03:33] WhereIsMySpoon: or apis
[2015-05-21 04:03:51] WhereIsMySpoon: do -> learn -> refactor -> repeat
[2015-05-21 04:04:00] extor: Yeah my first goal is to produce web automation...already have that goal. Now I am "shopping" for ways to do this other than with Awesomium which has dissapointed me.
[2015-05-21 04:04:24] extor: Yes you guys are right, I should stop talking and start walking
[2015-05-21 04:04:48] WhereIsMySpoon: :P
[2015-05-21 04:04:58] WhereIsMySpoon: feel free to ask qs here any time though
[2015-05-21 04:05:12] WhereIsMySpoon: but since you have a deadline..
[2015-05-21 04:05:16] WhereIsMySpoon: better get on with it ;)
[2015-05-21 04:05:50] WhereIsMySpoon: extor: break down your goal into problems, you said you wanted registration, scraping, posting
[2015-05-21 04:06:05] WhereIsMySpoon: start with automating registration of a simple form
[2015-05-21 04:06:08] WhereIsMySpoon: for example
[2015-05-21 04:06:31] extor: yes will do registration first, already doing it in awesomium so have gained knowledge about the various tasks
[2015-05-21 04:06:55] extor: the form fields, field names and ids, DOM model to retrieve code for buttons and links.
[2015-05-21 04:07:22] WhereIsMySpoon: (:
[2015-05-21 04:09:34] *barancev is not impressed by awesomium API'
[2015-05-21 04:10:53] barancev: imho, it serves better developing apps with embedded webkit, not "browser automation"
[2015-05-21 04:13:08] extor: Yes it was recommended to me by others and I suppose they themselves did not understand what they were doing.
[2015-05-21 04:13:30] extor: I was too much of a noob to understand the pros and cons, now I do a little tiny bit

[2015-05-21 06:41:02] Anton2k: Hey guys, just looking for some clarification to see if i am understanding correctly how selenium grid works, you have a machine running selenium server in hub mode and another machine running selenium server in node mode
[2015-05-21 06:41:41] Anton2k: a test is sent to the hub and then sent to the node which executes the actual test
[2015-05-21 06:42:33] Anton2k: or it might be there are multiple nodes and the grid sends the same test to so i might have a mac linux and windows machine all running firefox and the test would be ran on all of those nodes

[2015-05-21 09:56:40] jleyba: sad point 2) selenium still requires java 6
[2015-05-21 09:56:50] WhereIsMySpoon: right
[2015-05-21 09:56:59] lukeis: *still only requires java 6
[2015-05-21 09:57:00] WhereIsMySpoon: makes more sense :p
[2015-05-21 09:57:54] jleyba: lukeis, i've long been asking to require java 7. i still don't understand why we don't
[2015-05-21 09:58:01] lukeis:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-05-21 09:58:16] lukeis: thread on the dev list suggests we're ok to require java 7 now
[2015-05-21 09:58:31] lukeis: simonstewart: comments there?
[2015-05-21 09:58:54] jleyba: should just establish a policy like Firefox. We require Java N-1 and support Java N-1/N
[2015-05-21 09:59:42] lukeis: except with Firefox and native events we're not doing that :)
[2015-05-21 09:59:42] WhereIsMySpoon: we would support java 0.857?
[2015-05-21 09:59:48] WhereIsMySpoon: :p

[2015-05-21 10:13:31] anurag_: can anyone me with it?
[2015-05-21 10:13:36] anurag_: *help
[2015-05-21 10:15:31] dude-x: just write about your problem
[2015-05-21 10:15:47] rorycb: dude-x: isn't there a macro for that? :)
[2015-05-21 10:16:05] rorycb: :ask
[2015-05-21 10:16:08] dude-x: rorycb: there is but i feel it’s a tad passive-aggressive
[2015-05-21 10:16:33] rorycb: dude-x: fair. I forgot what it said :)
[2015-05-21 10:21:03] anurag_: selenium firefox clears my browser histrory after i close the driver; how can i prevent it from doing that?
[2015-05-21 10:24:35] dude-x: anurag_: well
[2015-05-21 10:25:15] dude-x: anurag_: by default, Selenium will create a new anonymous profile for Firefox
[2015-05-21 10:25:29] dude-x: then when it stops running, it will close the browser and clean up the tmp folder that has the profile
[2015-05-21 10:26:17] anurag_: dude-x : I have created a new profile and i am using it; but still it is cleaning the browsing history
[2015-05-21 10:27:15] dude-x: anurag_: so you’re loading the profile with p = webdriver.FirefoxProfile(‘/path’)
[2015-05-21 10:27:29] dude-x: d = webdriver.Firefox(p)?
[2015-05-21 10:27:33] anurag_: dude-x : Yes
[2015-05-21 10:28:01] dude-x: well…
[2015-05-21 10:28:16] dude-x: If I remember correctly, it still copies the profile anyway
[2015-05-21 10:28:26] dude-x: after all, you don’t want the history to influence future test

[2015-05-21 10:29:14] dude-x: :api
[2015-05-21 10:32:15] anurag_: dude-x : Thanks for them..Looking into it ..also, Is it affecting preferences of browser or i am going into wrong direction?
[2015-05-21 10:35:25] dude-x: anurag_: well looking at the source code, even if you override the firefox quit command
[2015-05-21 10:35:35] dude-x: it will still copy the original profile over
[2015-05-21 10:35:37] dude-x: to a temp file
[2015-05-21 10:35:56] dude-x: anurag_: why do you need browser history after a “test” run
[2015-05-21 10:36:03] dude-x: are you using it for tetsts or general browser automation?
[2015-05-21 10:36:33] anurag_: actually, I am using it for general browser automation.
[2015-05-21 10:38:01] dude-x: well, two choices then
[2015-05-21 10:38:10] dude-x: 1, override the firefox code
[2015-05-21 10:38:18] dude-x: 2, use IE

[2015-05-21 10:39:30] anurag_: dude-x : thanks for your help..Let me try to override the code
[2015-05-21 10:40:07] anurag_: so, basically, it should prevent it from removing temp folder
[2015-05-21 10:40:07] anurag_: ?

[2015-05-21 10:40:46] dude-x: that could be sufficient
[2015-05-21 10:41:07] dude-x: but keep in mind the init of Firefox() will copy your designated profile to a temp folder
[2015-05-21 10:41:14] dude-x: your OS may erase that tmp folder after some time

[2015-05-21 10:41:51] dude-x: so it will have to override quit and __init__
[2015-05-21 10:43:26] anurag_: dude-x :  will be right if i am prevent it from creating temp folder and making it use profile folder itself or that may worse the situation?

[2015-05-21 11:45:55] simonstewart: crazyfun is the perfect name. It met every single one of the goals I had for it
[2015-05-21 11:46:14] simonstewart: One of which was to prevent other people attempting to adopt it for their projects
[2015-05-21 11:46:19] rorycb: simonstewart: it sometimes makes me cry :)
[2015-05-21 11:46:34] lukeis: of course that was a goal....
[2015-05-21 11:46:34] simonstewart: Any particular reason?
[2015-05-21 11:47:04] rorycb: simonstewart: when getting back to it after a year, it isn't always consistent on how things get called
[2015-05-21 11:47:30] rorycb: ie: running tests for ruby vs python is almost the same, but not quite
[2015-05-21 11:47:30] simonstewart: There is that

[2015-05-21 11:51:38] lukeis: did you build firefox first?
[2015-05-21 11:51:41] simonstewart: Something about a browser_specific_template.py not missing something
