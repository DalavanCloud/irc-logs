[2015-05-12 01:20:25] Industrial: Hi. I'm a web developer and I'm getting a little tired of making the same interaction loops on websites as I develop to get the app in a state where I can test my current problem. I'd like to use a program to capture macros so I can stop clicking around the site and start testing the problem at hand :) make my development loop smaller. Can Selenium do this?
[2015-05-12 01:21:16] Industrial: So I don't want to code the test, I want to point & click (because I maybe need to make 10/20 different automations on a single day that are small things, not big tests that need to run over 20 different devices.)

[2015-05-12 11:46:06] na_th_an: I'm trying to create a FluentWait that will return a list of WebElements found by some By relative to some SearchContext. The problem is, I want to do this quickly (less than two seconds) and ignore the implicit wait timeout when finding these elements.
[2015-05-12 11:46:18] kyoob: is there a primer or tutorial somewhere for setting up a test lab with grid and docker containers?
[2015-05-12 11:47:00] na_th_an: I don't want to have to change the implicit wait of the driver. Is this possible? Currently, my FluentWait waits the implicit timeout, even if the FluentWait timeout is 2 seconds, it still waits the 30 second implicit timeout
[2015-05-12 11:47:21] jimevans: na_th_an: set the implicit wait timeout to 0, use your explicit wait ("FluentWait"), then proceed.
[2015-05-12 11:47:25] jimevans: no other way around it.
[2015-05-12 11:47:34] na_th_an: what if I don't have the driver though?
[2015-05-12 11:47:43] jimevans: also, don't mix implicit and explicit waits.
[2015-05-12 11:47:52] na_th_an: and why doesn't ExpectedConditions have to obey the implicit wait
[2015-05-12 11:47:56] jimevans: (and this is exactly why)\
[2015-05-12 11:48:06] na_th_an: I guess that's my real question, is why ExpectedConditions doesn't have this problem
[2015-05-12 11:48:54] jimevans: when you mix implicit and explicit waits, the behavior is undefined.
[2015-05-12 11:49:21] na_th_an: but I can do a WebDriverWait with an expected condition and it times out in less than the implicit timeout
[2015-05-12 11:49:34] jimevans: i'm telling you, the behavior is undefined.
[2015-05-12 11:49:37] na_th_an: it'd be nice to not mix implicit and explicit timeouts but that's really not going to happen with the monolithic code base we use
[2015-05-12 11:50:07] jimevans: na_th_an: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15164742/combining-implicit-wait-and-explicit-wait-together-results-in-unexpected-wait-ti/15174978
[2015-05-12 11:51:20] jimevans: i point you to the link as a shortcut to rehashing the logic here.

[2015-05-12 11:51:28] na_th_an: so are you saying, if I am to use an explicit wait, then the implicit wait should be set to 0?+
[2015-05-12 11:51:34] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-12 11:51:41] jimevans: i would encourage that, yes
[2015-05-12 11:52:20] na_th_an: thanks, this is all good to know
[2015-05-12 11:52:37] na_th_an: I'm still confused at why wait.until(ExpectedConditions.whatever()) works when I have an implicit wait set though
[2015-05-12 11:52:44] jimevans: i honestly wish we'd never included implicit waits in the first place, but whatever
[2015-05-12 11:53:35] na_th_an: if there were no implicit waits the single-page webapp I'm supposed to automate would be damn near impossible since everything is AJAX
[2015-05-12 11:53:50] jimevans: blog posts i'll never get around to writing: "implicit waits considered harmful"
[2015-05-12 11:53:55] na_th_an: I just wish there was a doesElementExist() kind of method that could tell me if an element exists or not without the implicit wait
[2015-05-12 11:54:11] jimevans: it's a dead-simple wrapper method to write.
[2015-05-12 11:54:24] na_th_an: to reset the implicit wait?
[2015-05-12 11:54:29] na_th_an: go to zero, check, then revert?
[2015-05-12 11:55:04] pixelport, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2015-05-12 11:55:08] jimevans: if you insist on using implicit waits, that would be the pattern, yes.
[2015-05-12 11:55:18] jimevans: (for some definition of "you")
[2015-05-12 11:55:32] na_th_an: heh
[2015-05-12 11:55:36] na_th_an: it'd be nice if you could read the implicit wait from the driver
[2015-05-12 11:56:09] jimevans: yes, i've made that argument in some spec meetings too.
