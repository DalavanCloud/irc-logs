[2015-05-29 03:30:55] Tony: Can some one point me to documentation that will enable me to run one test across multiple instances of the same browser? for example i want to run my web driver test, its already pointing to my hub, to which i have a node registered on, atm i have it running on firefox one time, i want it to run on 5 instances of firefox at the same time, is that
[2015-05-29 03:30:55] Tony: possible? i'm using ruby
[2015-05-29 03:32:15] rorycb, quitting. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2015-05-29 03:37:41] Dave_B_: I'm confused - have you got a single test that needs multiple browser instances? Or several tests and you want them to all run at the same time?
[2015-05-29 03:38:18] Dave_B_: if the first then you can just create more driver instances in the normal way (though if possible try and avoid tests that require multiple browser instances)
[2015-05-29 03:38:48] Dave_B_: if the second then it depends on your test runner - if it supports parallel execution then you're all good (assumnig you have done things like scope your drivers appropriately)

[2015-05-29 03:51:00] Tony: Thanks Dave_B_ its the first, are there any code examples of this being done that i could look @?
[2015-05-29 03:52:29] Rollup, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-05-29 03:55:47] Dave_B_: a super trivial example with two driver instances (in this case both local but you can do the exact same with remote), in this case in python as that's what I use but I imagine ruby isn't too different
[2015-05-29 03:55:48] Dave_B_: https://gist.github.com/daveberg/7617a6b67f8a3b7ad39f
[2015-05-29 03:56:58] Dave_B_: could of course move the driver creation into it's own method/class/function/whatever to avoid repetition of how to set up your remote driver
[2015-05-29 03:57:22] Dave_B_: have you already got several nodes available on your grid?
[2015-05-29 03:57:30] Dave_B_: or, several browser instances

[2015-05-29 05:12:12] Tony: Thanks Dave_B_
[2015-05-29 05:12:28] Dave_B_: no worries, hope it helps
[2015-05-29 05:12:39] Tony: currently i only have on the node available, which is also acting as my hub
[2015-05-29 05:13:47] Tony: im not sure how many instances of firefox i have but on my grid console i see, under web driver v: then 5 firefox icons
[2015-05-29 05:13:54] Tony: same with chrome
[2015-05-29 05:14:27] Dave_B_: so you'll probably be using the default config which allows up to 5 concurrent browser instances, and up to 5 firefox, 5 chrome etc
[2015-05-29 05:14:46] Dave_B_: which means you can have 5 total, not 5 ff & 5 chrome at the same time
[2015-05-29 05:16:28] Tony: ah i never knew thats, so 5 browsers running at any one time
[2015-05-29 05:16:37] rananda, quitting. (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[2015-05-29 05:16:42] Tony: so i could have 2 ff 2 chrome and 1 ie for example
[2015-05-29 05:19:04] Tony: I have another kind of side question, is there any way to record how long it takes for each step in a test to execute as well as recording all the resources that get loaded for a page (a bit like what you see in the network tab in chrome and firefox?)
[2015-05-29 05:23:12] Dave_B_: test execution times can probably be handled by whatever your test runner is, but resource loading wouldn't be easy - I'd probably use a proxy for that personally

[2015-05-29 06:10:32] Tony: David_B_ I would agree a proxy would be a good idea for that, would still need to see how that would all tie in though. With regards to test runner, and sorry for my ignorance but what exactly is meant by test runner? Currently my setup is Web-Drivertest written in ruby > Hub > Node > Browser
[2015-05-29 06:13:45] Tony: where does the test runner fit in there? im still reading through the selenium documentation
[2015-05-29 06:13:47] knownasilya, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-29 06:14:38] Dave_B_: I don't know much about ruby, but I'd assume you've either used some kind of testing framework or written your own runner of some kind, like Test::Unit, RSpec, whatever
[2015-05-29 06:14:49] Dave_B_: the test runner has basically nothing to do with selenium
[2015-05-29 06:15:00] Dave_B_: it's the thing that causes your ruby code to be run
[2015-05-29 06:15:38] Dave_B_: it'll know nothing about any of the hub/node/browser stuff, all it'll know about is how to trigger test cases and report back success/failure/error type messages

[2015-05-29 06:29:16] Tony: would i be right in saying that if a step fails the test runner will report the step that failed and what went wrong? would it just be a matter of including the test runner in the test and it would do all the work?

[2015-05-29 10:52:54] lukeis: ohai santiycr :)
[2015-05-29 10:52:57] santiycr: barancev, lukeis did our new linux vm do the trick?
[2015-05-29 10:53:06] santiycr: ohai lukeis!!
[2015-05-29 10:53:23] lukeis: barancev checked in a 'fix' before your fix to work around the issue :)
[2015-05-29 10:53:34] santiycr: oh, haha
[2015-05-29 10:53:41] santiycr: guess selenium is still compatible with java 6?
[2015-05-29 10:53:46] barancev: yes, we've found a workaround
[2015-05-29 10:53:50] santiycr: nice
[2015-05-29 10:53:56] santiycr: ok, well next time it won't be necessary
[2015-05-29 10:53:57] barancev: selenium is mostly java 6 compatiblr
[2015-05-29 10:54:02] lukeis: basically only html unit was compiled for java 7, so when loading drivers in the standalone, if java version mismatch, ignore the driver
[2015-05-29 10:54:13] santiycr: ah, nice
[2015-05-29 10:54:30] santiycr: yeah, I don't think people use sauce to run htmlunit anyways :D
[2015-05-29 10:54:43] lukeis: hopefully not :-D
[2015-05-29 10:54:46] santiycr: BTW, have you guys tried firefox 38 on sauce?

[2015-05-29 10:55:47] santiycr: lukeis: I'm pretty sure it will not go well
[2015-05-29 10:55:55] lukeis: heh
[2015-05-29 10:55:56] santiycr: at least it doesn't on the 2.45.0
[2015-05-29 10:56:06] lukeis: well, we have fixes for 38 in master

[2015-05-29 12:07:12] LocusAsaf: woops

[2015-05-29 12:18:25] D3M0S: have you heard of Page Object Pattern??
[2015-05-29 12:18:27] LocusAsaf: the thing to mention is that the test function automatically does that is in the fixture code automatically based on the argument in the test
[2015-05-29 12:18:33] D3M0S: this might be your missing peice here

[2015-05-29 12:20:07] octomeow: basepage class has a method which inits the page of needed type
[2015-05-29 12:20:38] octomeow: so any method defined in any page can return any other page type
[2015-05-29 12:21:16] LocusAsaf: octomeow: what I think you're all talking about is a class that has all the appropriate css and helper methods to do something on a page
[2015-05-29 12:21:40] D3M0S: man, I can't write python, would you be able to understand it if I did it in Java?
[2015-05-29 12:21:47] octomeow: to make this possible: page = ((BasePage)page).OpenSignInForm().ValidLogin(PRSettings.Username, PRSettings.Password1);

[2015-05-29 12:24:58] smyers: Things I've learned writing tests with pytest and selenium: Page objects are good. Providing a function that gives you a webdriver instance is good, so you don't need the test framework to get a browser.
[2015-05-29 12:25:14] kggr, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-29 12:25:34] smyers: Baking navigation into fixtures is no fun, because it makes interactive development much harder, versus just having a navigate('destination') function.
[2015-05-29 12:27:01] LocusAsaf: smyers: so you would favor just having the same boilerplate in every single function?
[2015-05-29 12:27:14] smyers: Dear god no
[2015-05-29 12:27:40] LocusAsaf: like "login(driver); navigate('destination', driver);"
[2015-05-29 12:28:01] LocusAsaf: if you don't let the fixture do it then what will do it?
[2015-05-29 12:28:27] LocusAsaf: you need to call those two functions somewhere
[2015-05-29 12:28:59] smyers: And, ideally, that place would be your page object: login_page_instance.login(username, password)
[2015-05-29 12:29:20] smyers: In the test, that would be followed by an assertion
[2015-05-29 12:29:45] smyers: Outside of the test, you'd have a webdriver instance that you can poke at for prototyping tests
[2015-05-29 12:30:17] LocusAsaf: smyers: I don't really see the benefit of creating a page object other than storing some css
[2015-05-29 12:30:42] LocusAsaf: where instead I can just have a login function which is much leaner and easier to understand than a page object
[2015-05-29 12:31:12] LocusAsaf: although you're all trying to convince me now I'm just kind of visual so I'm probably not seeing the full picture you're trying to describe

[2015-05-29 12:32:06] LocusAsaf: smyers: if I single login method it's as simple as changing some content in that method, whats the difference if its a method or a class?
[2015-05-29 12:32:34] smyers: That's sorta like asking about the benefits of object-oriented programming, no?
[2015-05-29 12:32:46] LocusAsaf: functions are as object-oriented as classes are
[2015-05-29 12:32:54] LocusAsaf: how is a function not object oriented
[2015-05-29 12:32:57] sircapsalot: what's object-oriented programming?
[2015-05-29 12:33:02] D3M0S: LocusAsaf, http://pastebin.com/2VxjCvFK
[2015-05-29 12:33:05] *sircapsalot kidding..'
[2015-05-29 12:33:28] *smyers backs away slowly'
[2015-05-29 12:33:55] LocusAsaf: I'm not trying to be snarky, forget what I said
[2015-05-29 12:34:05] LocusAsaf: let me create an example and you tell me what's better
[2015-05-29 12:34:36] D3M0S: LocusAsaf, did you see my example for your situation using Page Objects in java
[2015-05-29 12:34:45] LocusAsaf: will look in just one second
[2015-05-29 12:34:51] D3M0S: there's ofc better ways than just passing the driver around in constructors
[2015-05-29 12:34:58] D3M0S: but I'll leave those up to you.
[2015-05-29 12:35:57] admc, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-05-29 12:37:59] santiycr: lukeis: let's do eet
[2015-05-29 12:38:10] santiycr: I'm out next week, but I'll send you an email so we can start planning
[2015-05-29 12:38:18] lukeis: sounds good :)
[2015-05-29 12:38:19] LocusAsaf: smyers: see http://pastebin.com/UJkjd5C8
[2015-05-29 12:38:42] LocusAsaf: is that a good example, am I missing anything, do you see anything better about the object vs. the function?
[2015-05-29 12:38:55] LocusAsaf: D3M0S: looking now
[2015-05-29 12:40:41] LocusAsaf: D3M0S: okay so your trick is that you have well defined routes from one page (or object) to another and you return the next page that contains the same driver
[2015-05-29 12:40:59] D3M0S: not my trick, this is page object pattern
[2015-05-29 12:41:34] LocusAsaf: fair enough but what i said is true
[2015-05-29 12:41:38] D3M0S: yep
[2015-05-29 12:42:00] D3M0S: as you can see, the advantages are in maintainability and readability in the actual test
[2015-05-29 12:42:04] LocusAsaf: this is what I was kind of mentioning before too
[2015-05-29 12:42:10] D3M0S: which are like..the 2 most important things
[2015-05-29 12:42:44] LocusAsaf: it definitely makes a lot more sense in java I'm not totally sold on doing page objects in python though
[2015-05-29 12:42:50] LocusAsaf: I'm curious what smyers has to say though
[2015-05-29 12:42:59] LocusAsaf: or anyone else that is familiar with python and wants to look at my bpaste
[2015-05-29 12:43:16] LocusAsaf: pastebin rather
[2015-05-29 12:44:18] smyers: This really is a discussion of the merits of OO design, which are intrisic to the value of the page object model.
[2015-05-29 12:44:55] smyers: (even in python)
[2015-05-29 12:45:11] LocusAsaf: smyers: I totally agree and I'm totally fine if you say that I'm wrong
[2015-05-29 12:45:25] LocusAsaf: was my example sound though?
[2015-05-29 12:45:26] D3M0S: yeah, page object model is shite with terrible OOD

[2015-05-29 12:45:52] LocusAsaf: was I missing anything there?
[2015-05-29 12:45:53] merobertsjr__, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-05-29 12:46:10] D3M0S: and your ability to take OOD principals and design patterns and efficiently put them into effect is really what makes page object model strong or mediocre
[2015-05-29 12:46:12] LocusAsaf: I just want to know specifically why because I just don't see it right now
[2015-05-29 12:46:18] santiycr, quitting. (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[2015-05-29 12:46:28] merobertsjr__, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-29 12:46:57] smyers: I can't really answer that for you. All I can do is suggest that you separate your concerns wherever possible because things change, your assumptions will be challenged, and refactors will happen.
[2015-05-29 12:47:37] LocusAsaf: separate what concerns?
[2015-05-29 12:47:40] D3M0S: smyers, +1
[2015-05-29 12:47:57] *D3M0S sighs'
[2015-05-29 12:48:14] D3M0S: don't stick your hand in fire, why?
[2015-05-29 12:48:24] D3M0S: because you'll get burned, whats a burn?
[2015-05-29 12:49:12] smyers: Again, I can't really answer that for you. Or, in this case, shouldn't. You clearly need to be concerned with how to havigate to a page. Also locating elements is important, right? Filling forms, I assume?
[2015-05-29 12:49:35] LocusAsaf: yes of course
[2015-05-29 12:50:28] smyers: My apologies, those were rhetorical questions. I don't know what your concerns are, so I don't know how to separate them.
[2015-05-29 12:50:47] LocusAsaf: okay well it feels like I'm reading a forunte from a cookie right now
[2015-05-29 12:51:19] LocusAsaf: let me continue
[2015-05-29 12:51:22] D3M0S: LocusAsaf, they're pretty common programming principals
[2015-05-29 12:51:46] D3M0S: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns
[2015-05-29 12:52:16] LocusAsaf: I can create a file called "login_page.py", "x_page.py" and I can put two different styles of things in there
[2015-05-29 12:52:37] LocusAsaf: one style would be putting in classes, see the pastebin I example
[2015-05-29 12:52:51] LocusAsaf: another style would be putting in functions, again see example
[2015-05-29 12:53:10] LocusAsaf: when page X changes some css, I go into said file, change some constants and I'm done
[2015-05-29 12:53:19] alexwhitman, quitting. (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[2015-05-29 12:53:26] D3M0S: LocusAsaf, yeah, that's separation of concerns
[2015-05-29 12:53:29] LocusAsaf: you're telling me follow OO, stuff will change
[2015-05-29 12:54:15] LocusAsaf: either if I put classes or functions, they are still objects and you can consider both "page objects"
[2015-05-29 12:54:52] LocusAsaf: so unless you can convince me that my functions should be methods in classes, I'm not going to write extra code
[2015-05-29 12:56:16] LocusAsaf: if you can convince me that it's good, I'll gladly put the code in
[2015-05-29 12:56:38] D3M0S: It's not my job to convince you of anything
[2015-05-29 12:56:44] seljenkinsbot: Yippee, build fixed!
[2015-05-29 12:56:44] seljenkinsbot: Project Firefox 31 XP Javascript Tests build #1437: FIXED in 6 min 36 sec: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Firefox%2031%20XP%20Javascript%20Tests/1437/
[2015-05-29 12:56:48] nbnds, quitting. (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[2015-05-29 12:57:19] D3M0S: LocusAsaf, I can only say this, I've been doing this for 5 years, and this is the way I do things...there are plenty other developers out there and in this channel that feel the exact same as I do
[2015-05-29 12:57:54] D3M0S: Follow good design principals, lest there be dragons.
[2015-05-29 12:57:57] LocusAsaf: D3M0S: absolutely
[2015-05-29 12:58:01] LocusAsaf: and I agree with you
[2015-05-29 12:58:04] LocusAsaf: and I apologize
[2015-05-29 12:58:37] LocusAsaf: I don't mean to be argumentative.  I know i'm not perfect and I know there is more to learn, that is why I come here to ask questions.  I'm delighted when someone tells me I'm doing it wrong and shows me a better way
[2015-05-29 12:58:41] D3M0S: and "writing extra code" you saw my simple java example right?
[2015-05-29 12:58:53] D3M0S: in java there's load of "extra code"
[2015-05-29 12:58:58] LocusAsaf: I think the point I'm trying to make is that my code is just as OO as your example
[2015-05-29 12:59:33] LocusAsaf: the question I was asking smyers is a bit language specific though
[2015-05-29 12:59:45] LocusAsaf: as in, there are many ways to skin the cat
[2015-05-29 12:59:51] LocusAsaf: sometimes one is better, sometimes they are the same
[2015-05-29 13:00:10] LocusAsaf: I was asking, which way do you think is better and why, or are they the same?
[2015-05-29 13:00:46] LocusAsaf: D3M0S: what you code did illustrate is that in my page objects I can have well defined routes to another page and have it return the same driver
[2015-05-29 13:01:14] aaronhum_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-29 13:01:20] LocusAsaf: it's a little bit contrived in the way I'm defining my page objects since the driver is not really being mutated
[2015-05-29 13:01:32] LocusAsaf: but I think it's a reasonable way to solve my problem
[2015-05-29 13:01:48] aaronhum_, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-05-29 13:02:25] aaronhum_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-29 13:02:31] smyers: The biggest reason I can give you is that going with page objects and other reasonable abstractions will save your ass down the line when refactoring is necessary.
[2015-05-29 13:02:35] aaronhumerickhou, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2015-05-29 13:03:04] D3M0S: LocusAsaf, how many test cases do you have?
[2015-05-29 13:03:12] D3M0S: if you have less than 10 do whatever you want
[2015-05-29 13:03:24] D3M0S: if you have more than 100, do as smyers says
[2015-05-29 13:03:29] smyers: I have thousands ><
[2015-05-29 13:04:02] smyers: My suite takes 3 days to run. Someone just pushed a fix that broke every page...
[2015-05-29 13:04:08] smyers: I fixed it with one line of code.
[2015-05-29 13:04:10] LocusAsaf: smyers: I 100% and understand what you are saying
[2015-05-29 13:04:16] D3M0S: smyers, I feel ya there.
[2015-05-29 13:04:36] D3M0S: smyers, I just gave a talk about page object pattern a few weeks ago
[2015-05-29 13:05:11] smyers: I really need to organize my thoughts and do public talks, specifically about selenium, py.test, and page modeling.
[2015-05-29 13:05:31] smyers: I've done enough internally, and ironically work at red hat where I really ought to be more sharing :)
[2015-05-29 13:05:36] *smyers is terrible'
[2015-05-29 13:05:37] D3M0S: I got told to write a book at my talk!
[2015-05-29 13:06:05] D3M0S: I dunno if that's gonna happen...
[2015-05-29 13:06:54] dimacus, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-05-29 13:07:01] LocusAsaf: smyers: I just want to know.  Do you agree or disagree.  Is modeling a page in a module with functions more or less OO than with classes?
[2015-05-29 13:07:22] smyers: functions are inherently less oo than with classes if you're using them properly
[2015-05-29 13:07:25] smyers: (in python)
[2015-05-29 13:07:52] LocusAsaf: okay so that's why we can't get on the same page
[2015-05-29 13:07:55] smyers: That doesn't make them better or worse, just a different tool for a different job
[2015-05-29 13:08:39] sircapsalot, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-05-29 13:08:40] LocusAsaf: I don't think it's a huge difference but I think they both just as OO and I would give preference to the functions because I think they are easier to understand
[2015-05-29 13:10:41] smyers: You're entitled to believe whatever you choose. I'm entitled to dinner.
[2015-05-29 13:11:04] merobertsjr__, quitting. (Quit: Be back later ...)
[2015-05-29 13:12:03] phasze: Anyone know the .NET remotedriver command to get executing server name or address?
[2015-05-29 13:14:27] LocusAsaf: smyers: thanks for your input
[2015-05-29 13:14:36] LocusAsaf: I'd love to see some examples sometimes if you can share
[2015-05-29 13:15:10] LocusAsaf: D3M0S: another thing that I think you're in agreement with with smyers is that you start your tests off with the browser and navigate in the test
[2015-05-29 13:15:35] Tony, quitting. (Quit: http://www.kiwiirc.com/ - A hand crafted IRC client)
[2015-05-29 13:15:40] LocusAsaf: I guess using either common helpers or the page objects themselves
[2015-05-29 13:15:44] emi_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-29 13:16:04] LocusAsaf: I'm assuming you two agree because he said he likes to do it and because you did so in your example
[2015-05-29 13:16:05] jimevans1: phasze: umm, what?
[2015-05-29 13:16:32] jimevans1, changing nick to jimevans.
[2015-05-29 13:17:28] emi_: need help with chromedriver in windows 8.1. I've added the directory for chromedriver to the PATH variable, but I'm still getting the unable to find the chromedriver executable error. am i missing something?
[2015-05-29 13:18:34] D3M0S: emi_, did you logout of windows and log back in?
[2015-05-29 13:18:48] D3M0S: emi_, PATH variable changes don't take effect in the same windows session
[2015-05-29 13:19:03] emi_: restarted the computer? Will tryi it again.
[2015-05-29 13:19:12] D3M0S: emi_, restart works too
[2015-05-29 13:19:22] jimevans: also, adding something to \windows\system32, even though that directory is nominally on the path, doesn't guarantee that one will find the file one puts there.
[2015-05-29 13:21:17] phasze: jimevans: has the .NET implementation done something like this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9771932/how-to-get-executing-server-name-or-address-with-selenium-server-2-20
[2015-05-29 13:21:42] phasze: basically I want the IP or hostname of the node that ran the test
[2015-05-29 13:21:59] jimevans: nope. the .NET bindings don't expose the command executor
[2015-05-29 13:22:07] phasze: blast
[2015-05-29 13:22:25] phasze: in the future maybe?
[2015-05-29 13:22:32] phasze: or a command in remotewebdriver for that?
[2015-05-29 13:23:08] jimevans: i wouldn't bet on it. not unless you can make a really, *REALLY* compelling reason (one that convinces me, specifically) for it to happen.
[2015-05-29 13:23:28] phasze: reporting of the node that ran the test isn't good enough? :(
[2015-05-29 13:23:48] jimevans: exposing the command executor leaks too many abstractions to be useful
[2015-05-29 13:24:03] phasze: specifically would help with large node clusters determining of a specific node has or had a problem
[2015-05-29 13:24:16] emi_: thanks for the hints. finally got it to work.
[2015-05-29 13:24:27] emi_, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2015-05-29 13:24:33] phasze: you don't even have to expose the commandexecutor, just the ability to get the address of the remote node
[2015-05-29 13:25:17] D3M0S: it's not printed when remote driver connects?
[2015-05-29 13:25:18] Padawan, quitting. (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[2015-05-29 13:25:23] D3M0S: I thought it did that
[2015-05-29 13:25:37] Padawan, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-29 13:25:42] jimevans: phasze: i don't know if the hub ever reports the node used.
[2015-05-29 13:25:50] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-29 13:26:36] jimevans: note that the machine you connect to in the constructor of RemoteWebDriver may not ultimately be the machine where the browser is actually executed.
[2015-05-29 13:27:35] D3M0S: jimevans, yeah, I've been away from my massive grid for a few months so I don't quite remember
[2015-05-29 13:27:40] phasze: jimevans: yeah, that's why I'd like the ability to see that and I thought that was already built in
[2015-05-29 13:28:01] jimevans: and if the java bindings never report the ultimate destination (the node) back over the wire, there's no way for the language bindings to give it to you.
[2015-05-29 13:28:12] phasze: do the java bindings not do that?
[2015-05-29 13:28:20] jimevans: i honestly don't know
[2015-05-29 13:28:26] D3M0S: phasze, I've heard of this project, it might expose some extra stuff that might help you out https://github.com/groupon/Selenium-Grid-Extras
[2015-05-29 13:28:45] phasze: hehe, I'm actually using a modified version of that D3M0S
[2015-05-29 13:29:05] D3M0S: but yeah, like jimevans said, if it doesnt ever come back over the wire...
[2015-05-29 13:29:22] phasze: I supposed I could just get the list of connected proxies to the hub and match the session ID....
[2015-05-29 13:29:27] phasze: suppose*
[2015-05-29 13:29:31] D3M0S: phasze, it's a possibility
[2015-05-29 13:29:43] santiycr, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-29 13:29:44] D3M0S: our old grid, had something where we used a servelet to choose the machine
[2015-05-29 13:29:49] D3M0S: but we got rid of that
[2015-05-29 13:29:50] jimevans: might be interesting if the java bindings did return back something identifying in the response to the create session command.
[2015-05-29 13:30:04] phasze: I think the link I provided had the command
[2015-05-29 13:30:10] D3M0S: because we wanted JUST the browser to come from the node, and then proxied all traffic back to the machine running the test
[2015-05-29 13:32:34] phasze: maybe the stackoverflow code I linked just gets you the hub address you connected to
[2015-05-29 13:32:40] phasze: I haven't tested the java
[2015-05-29 13:32:57] jimevans: if i had to guess, that'd be my suspicion
[2015-05-29 13:39:18] D3M0S: google I/O has an Android M Permissions talk in 30 minutes events.google.com/io2015
[2015-05-29 13:39:29] D3M0S: if anybody here is interested
[2015-05-29 13:42:49] barancev: FYI: Hub startup profiling results: http://screencast.com/t/jlBEEwTRPOR
