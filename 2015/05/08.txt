[2015-05-08 02:36:49] Dave_B_: given I live in Scotland I'm currently being depressed by the success of the SNP
[2015-05-08 02:37:01] barancev: omg...

[2015-05-08 02:39:09] p_l: Dave_B_: SNP is weird. On one side, nationalists and I have good reasons against nationalism... otoh, they sometimes appear to have sense in other things
[2015-05-08 02:39:29] AutomatedTester: Dave_B_: for my parish I had a choice of UKIP or Tories :(

[2015-05-08 02:40:20] barancev: marionette, save our souls!
[2015-05-08 02:40:29] Dave_B_: sometimes they do have sense, but they lie too much too blatantly and are totally let off on it by the scottish press (I realise all political parties lie, but still :p gotta draw the line somewhere)
[2015-05-08 02:40:49] Dave_B_: UKIP got a fair whack of the total vote
[2015-05-08 02:41:08] Dave_B_: more than twice SNP, yet 1 seat to 56 :p
[2015-05-08 02:41:22] AutomatedTester: Dave_B_: over 3 million votes
[2015-05-08 02:41:39] Dave_B_: :'(
[2015-05-08 02:42:13] AutomatedTester: this general trend world wide of moving to the right is scaring the crap out of me
[2015-05-08 02:43:05] AutomatedTester: at least Nigel Farage is still not an MP
[2015-05-08 02:43:14] Dave_B_: It's certainly interesting… I'm more worried by the rise of nationalism but then that probably reflects the areas we each live in!
[2015-05-08 02:43:16] Dave_B_: yeah
[2015-05-08 02:43:24] Dave_B_: saw they won 1 seat and had a moment of fear
[2015-05-08 02:43:48] AutomatedTester: it's official that Nigel lost to the tories
[2015-05-08 02:44:20] AutomatedTester: the seat they did win they lost over 8k votes
[2015-05-08 02:44:43] AutomatedTester: he won the area by 12k in the by election and only won by 3k this time

[2015-05-08 02:46:01] AutomatedTester: it's cold but and their idea of right wing is still way left of the tories
[2015-05-08 02:46:10] Dave_B_: I'm trying to think of a country I'd like to live in where the political landscape doesn't scare me - can't say I've really paid attention to Norway, is that the place to flee to? :p
[2015-05-08 02:46:19] simonstewart: I think the UK is one of the more right wing countries in Europe now
[2015-05-08 02:46:27] simonstewart: Germany might not be too bad
[2015-05-08 02:46:35] simonstewart: And Greece has fantastic weather

[2015-05-08 02:48:06] AutomatedTester: they apparently have the highest amount of porsches
[2015-05-08 02:48:28] Dave_B_: hmm, weird, just looked up the areas of each member of my family and we all are labour regions
[2015-05-08 02:48:34] Dave_B_: flukey
[2015-05-08 02:49:19] Dave_B_: well, i realise strictly voting isn't fluke, but you know what i mean :p

[2015-05-08 09:49:48] tdallacr: Using Selenium IDE 2.9.0 and Firefox 37.0.2 (on OS X), and so far I still have not been able to simulate a user hitting arrows up or down to slightly scroll the page. Tried sendKeys, keyPress, tried ${KEY_DOWN} as well as //40, but so far no luck. Any idea?
[2015-05-08 09:50:14] WhereIsMySpoon: tdallacr: you cant interact with the os level buttons on the browser
[2015-05-08 09:50:18] WhereIsMySpoon: only web page elements
[2015-05-08 09:50:25] WhereIsMySpoon: anything outside the dom is not interactable
[2015-05-08 09:51:07] tdallacr: Is there anyway to scroll the page? Or am I limited to jumping to an element?
[2015-05-08 09:51:09] WhereIsMySpoon: or did i misunderstand you
[2015-05-08 09:51:14] WhereIsMySpoon: why do you want to scroll
[2015-05-08 09:51:48] mekhami: WhereIsMySpoon that doesn't seem right.
[2015-05-08 09:51:55] mekhami: WhereIsMySpoon given that I can send_keys to a form item.
[2015-05-08 09:52:11] WhereIsMySpoon: mekhami: forms are in the dom
[2015-05-08 09:52:24] mekhami: right i understand
[2015-05-08 09:52:26] mekhami: just doesn't seem right
[2015-05-08 09:52:47] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2015-05-08 09:52:50] WhereIsMySpoon: what do you mean
[2015-05-08 09:52:56] WhereIsMySpoon: selenium interacts with the web page
[2015-05-08 09:52:58] tdallacr: The only success I've had so far to kinda bring me to an element in the page is sendKeys | target | \uE00F"
[2015-05-08 09:52:59] mekhami: like it seems like there should be a way to do exactly what he's saying
[2015-05-08 09:53:08] WhereIsMySpoon: there is but i want to know why
[2015-05-08 09:53:15] WhereIsMySpoon: u shouldnt need to scroll at all
[2015-05-08 09:53:52] tdallacr: The problem with the above, and the reason I would like to scroll, is that the above puts the element I want to see under the sticky header at the top.

[2015-05-08 09:56:23] tdallacr: I've used WebDriver before, and liked it. However, current employer wants a quick thing with IDE that's simple enough for product manager to launch
[2015-05-08 09:56:35] WhereIsMySpoon: woah woah woah
[2015-05-08 09:56:44] WhereIsMySpoon: a thing with the ide "for the product manager to launch"?
[2015-05-08 09:56:48] WhereIsMySpoon: excuse me?
[2015-05-08 09:57:09] WhereIsMySpoon: you mean for him to run it or for him to launch an app with the IDE being part of it?
[2015-05-08 09:57:10] tdallacr: to launch and test a dev site
[2015-05-08 09:57:13] WhereIsMySpoon: oh right
[2015-05-08 09:57:14] WhereIsMySpoon: phew lol
[2015-05-08 09:57:25] WhereIsMySpoon: tdallacr: you can make it that simple with webdriver too...
[2015-05-08 09:57:45] WhereIsMySpoon: write a test, write a shell/batch script to run it, tell him to double click it
[2015-05-08 09:57:58] WhereIsMySpoon: ??? -> profit
[2015-05-08 09:58:36] tdallacr: WhereIsMySpoon, I'd have to install Java on his machine though
[2015-05-08 09:58:49] tdallacr: probably
[2015-05-08 09:59:05] lukeis: i wouldn't even do that…  create a jenkins instance with a job, where it will tell him to pass in the url to the dev site and it runs the test suite and reports the results
[2015-05-08 09:59:21] WhereIsMySpoon: ^ this even
[2015-05-08 09:59:22] lukeis: unless this product manager needs to 'see' the automation running?
[2015-05-08 09:59:28] WhereIsMySpoon: (why would he)
[2015-05-08 09:59:41] WhereIsMySpoon: kinda defeats the purpose of automation if people need to see it running and dont trust it
[2015-05-08 09:59:45] lukeis: i've worked in silly places where they think they want that sort of thing ;)
[2015-05-08 10:00:04] lukeis: they don't understand that they really don't want to
[2015-05-08 10:00:17] WhereIsMySpoon: id hope if they were doing that, that they produce a nice detailed report on the automation every time
[2015-05-08 10:00:22] WhereIsMySpoon: with all of what it did
[2015-05-08 10:00:36] tdallacr: I agree with lukeis, if given enough time, maybe our SysOps department can set up all the dependencies on a server somewhere so a nice automated process can be easily used
[2015-05-08 10:00:36] WhereIsMySpoon: else id maybe suspect that they were just wasting their time
[2015-05-08 10:01:17] WhereIsMySpoon: "all the dependencies"?
[2015-05-08 10:01:20] WhereIsMySpoon: uh
[2015-05-08 10:01:48] WhereIsMySpoon: install jenkins, install selenium plugin, put selenium jar on node, start node connecting to jenkins server, run tests
[2015-05-08 10:01:59] WhereIsMySpoon: can all be done in less than a day
[2015-05-08 10:02:06] WhereIsMySpoon: for a simple setup
[2015-05-08 10:03:08] tdallacr: At a previous job, our SysOps dept tried to set something like that up, but couldn't make it work. Something about Java on Debian, I forgot... I wasn't the one who was asked to do it.
[2015-05-08 10:03:31] WhereIsMySpoon: ew, debian
[2015-05-08 10:03:42] tdallacr: If I was given the time, maybe I'd try on my sandbox.
[2015-05-08 10:05:00] tdallacr: afk, meeting, will try your Google suggestion, I guess my GoogleFu isn't strong today.
[2015-05-08 10:05:16] WhereIsMySpoon: good luck, weekend for me

[2015-05-08 10:48:52] jimevans: the driver probably *should* be the 32-bit one.
[2015-05-08 10:49:10] jimevans: see http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2014/09/screenshots-sendkeys-and-sixty-four.html for why
[2015-05-08 10:49:54] tony2, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-08 10:52:03] jimevans: improper protected mode settings are one of the leading causes of "x doesn't work in the IE driver"
[2015-05-08 10:52:39] jimevans: see http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/08/youre-doing-it-wrong-protected-mode-and.html for why
[2015-05-08 10:52:48] Auto1: Proctected Mode ( is disable for all zones)
[2015-05-08 10:53:42] jimevans: then, for "IE driver can't find the element on the page, but firefox and chrome do" are very often caused by timing issues.
[2015-05-08 10:55:00] jimevans: but i'd recommend using selenium-webdriver directly, instead of using watir-webdriver for troubleshooting.

[2015-05-08 10:56:06] Auto1: ok. any suggestion on using selenium-web-driver vs protractor ?
[2015-05-08 10:56:30] jimevans: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-05-08 10:56:53] jimevans: i have no specialized knowledge about any wrappers of webdriver that might be in use
[2015-05-08 10:57:11] dude-x: protractor is webdriver.js
[2015-05-08 10:57:14] jimevans: this includes protractor, capybara, coypu, watir, and so on.
[2015-05-08 10:57:31] dude-x: protractor knows how to wait for angular updates
[2015-05-08 10:59:04] jimevans: i *do* know that findElement(By.whatever…) works in the general case for IE11.
[2015-05-08 11:00:08] Auto1: so protractor is better only when testing angular apps?
[2015-05-08 11:02:00] dude-x: it's only better if you have an angular app and know how to write tests in Javascript

[2015-05-08 11:05:52] jimevans: in Auto1's example of "what doesn't work" it was in ruby, and had similar syntax to the watir api, so i mentioned it as something that would need to be taken out of the scenario before i could be of further assistance.

[2015-05-08 11:08:54] Auto1: I was able execute the test after running my command prompt as an administrator.
[2015-05-08 11:09:11] jimevans: Auto1: that fully indicates a Protected Mode issue to me.

[2015-05-08 11:10:26] jimevans: in navigating to the external url (google.com), you're crossing a protected mode boundary, which orphans the COM objects the driver uses to automate IE
[2015-05-08 11:10:50] jimevans: note, that's described in excruciating detail in the blog post to which i referred earlier

[2015-05-08 11:16:04] Auto1: follow the instructions from the blog:
[2015-05-08 11:16:05] Auto1: How do I fix it?
[2015-05-08 11:16:06] Auto1: One way to solve the problem is to either turn User Access Control (UAC) off, or elevate your privileges to an administrator when running WebDriver code,
[2015-05-08 11:16:16] Auto1: no reboot

[2015-05-08 11:17:35] jimevans: the whole point of that paragraph is why turning off UAC and or elevating to administrator are Bad Ideas™
[2015-05-08 11:18:44] Auto1: The simplest way to do that is to change the Protected Mode settings in the browser to be the same, either enabled or disabled,
[2015-05-08 11:18:48] Auto1: This does not work for me
[2015-05-08 11:20:12] kggr, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-08 11:20:13] jimevans: the only other thing i'd suggest is using the logging facilities of the IE driver to see where it's losing the connection.
[2015-05-08 11:20:38] Auto1: I am also on a vpn. not sure if this will cause any problems
[2015-05-08 11:20:50] jimevans: but the symptom is very, very much like what happens when a protected mode boundary is crossed.
[2015-05-08 11:21:36] jimevans: vpn shouldn't figure into it, assuming you're running the webdriver code and the browser on the same machine
[2015-05-08 11:23:21] dude-x: i've ran webdriver tests thorugh a vpn, vpn doesn't do anything bad

[2015-05-08 11:33:00] kyoob: hi
[2015-05-08 11:33:30] ghanima: question... its my understanding that selenimum can be used in a way similar to jmeter where you can do run a test through a central server and then have that test executed across multiple machines
[2015-05-08 11:33:35] ghanima: If that is correct
[2015-05-08 11:33:45] ghanima: Is it possible to do this with somethinbg like phantomjs
[2015-05-08 11:34:11] sircapsalot: selenimum can be hooked up to a CI, yes
[2015-05-08 11:34:26] dude-x: you can use selenium for load testing, but you will need scripts that are not flaky, that is super reliable, and then you will need to be able to command a lot of machines
[2015-05-08 11:34:29] sircapsalot: as well as use it's grid to distribute tests accross many different platforms and browsers

[2015-05-08 11:35:35] kyoob: ghanma are you looking to do load tests or just run phantomjs on  a handful of various machines?
[2015-05-08 11:35:43] kyoob: ghanima, that is
[2015-05-08 11:35:58] ghanima: kyoob: Load Test
[2015-05-08 11:36:13] ghanima: but I need to do this across multiple geographies
[2015-05-08 11:36:21] ghanima: and trying to find a way to orchestrate that
[2015-05-08 11:36:53] dude-x: that's hard.
[2015-05-08 11:36:56] dude-x: good luck
[2015-05-08 11:37:00] kyoob: what cases do you need phantomjs for instead of jmeter?  jmeter has webdriver plugins to interrogate pages
[2015-05-08 11:37:41] ghanima: I need to to test FrontEnd Elements
[2015-05-08 11:37:49] ghanima: I.e JS elements
[2015-05-08 11:38:20] ghanima: kyoob: my understanding is that the webdriver can't render javascript
[2015-05-08 11:38:58] kyoob: i mean
[2015-05-08 11:39:15] kyoob: webdriver is driving around your browser, which renders the javascript for you
[2015-05-08 11:39:52] kyoob: i don't understand the case for this though.  aren't the js elements performing on the client side?  why do you need to access js elements for a load test?

[2015-05-08 11:42:32] ghanima: kyoob: So my goal... is to perform use case testing at a certain load... logging into the site... confirming loggin was successful... enter text in a form field that has results returned through jquery... confirm results of search by confiming results which are rendered through a JS function
[2015-05-08 11:43:09] ghanima: The load test would try to simulate the client workflow described above at a certain concurrency rate
[2015-05-08 11:43:47] ghanima: does that make sense
[2015-05-08 11:44:03] kyoob: it sounds like javascript is processing this data and rendering it on the page, in which case i bet webdriver would work
[2015-05-08 11:44:32] kyoob: i guess in your position i'd try to do that once using webdriver instead of phantomjs
[2015-05-08 11:44:41] kyoob: and if it works explore the webdriver plugin for jmeter

[2015-05-08 11:57:40] kyoob: although really, you should separate your functional use case from the load testing machinery.  put load on your app the normal way using jmeter, and coordinate separate webdriver testing while the site is under load
[2015-05-08 12:00:28] ghanima: kyoob: thanks for the reference I am checking now

[2015-05-08 12:01:13] felixn, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2015-05-08 12:02:45] kyoob: well, it is, but generally functional testing either works or doesn't work once and doesn't need to be run 100 concurrent times to get that result
[2015-05-08 12:03:25] kyoob: if you just hammer your services using jmeter and then open up a browser and verify functionality once, it's much less work for the robots to do

[2015-05-08 12:22:45] eindoofus: hi, what would you call hooking up different page elements for future tests? like the creation of methods for interaction of a dropdown within a page object? trying to figure out the right word to use
[2015-05-08 12:23:08] kyoob: i'd call it buy that developer a beer
[2015-05-08 12:23:10] dude-x: utility class, component class
[2015-05-08 12:23:19] eindoofus: kyoob, lol
[2015-05-08 12:23:40] titusfortner: YAGNI? :)
[2015-05-08 12:24:00] eindoofus: i guess i'm looking for a word that describes the general functionality being developed.. like the term "test framework"
[2015-05-08 12:24:21] eindoofus: but "test framework" sounds a bit vague. lol
[2015-05-08 12:24:44] dude-x: kind of sounds like a forward reference
[2015-05-08 12:24:56] dude-x: but... you're being a bit vague
[2015-05-08 12:25:23] kyoob: oh, i see.  you're mapping interactions into the page object before you've got test cases that necessitate them
[2015-05-08 12:25:37] eindoofus: kyoob, yup :)

[2015-05-08 12:26:28] dannyfink: thanks titus - should check it out when you get a chance it seems like a neat framework, but they currently only support Java/JS bindings
[2015-05-08 12:26:32] dude-x: your base page object would have methods like click(), select(),get_text()
[2015-05-08 12:27:21] titusfortner: YAGNI means don't write things you aren't using yet, because if you end up not doing it, you're only cluttering your modeling. :)
[2015-05-08 12:27:37] dude-x: +1 to that
[2015-05-08 12:27:40] titusfortner: I've worked at too many places that mapped every single element on a page into a page object
[2015-05-08 12:27:43] dude-x: keep your code simple until you need stuff
[2015-05-08 12:27:48] titusfortner: and then I couldn't figure out what was used and what wasn't
[2015-05-08 12:28:17] kyoob: the thinking is "well, we're going to cover 100% of our functionality some day.  might as well have a comprehensive page object"
[2015-05-08 12:28:44] Auto1: so page object or no page object?
[2015-05-08 12:29:31] kyoob: page objects are good, but don't let the authoring of a perfect model stop you from writing actual tests
[2015-05-08 12:31:06] titusfortner: Add to your page model as you need things. Creating the perfect page model can result in confusion and lots of unnecessary rework later.
[2015-05-08 12:35:37] kyoob: so i guess the answer to the original question is 'creating a perfect page model' but it sounds nicer than it is in practice
[2015-05-08 12:37:39] dude-x: all my page objects inherit a base page object
[2015-05-08 12:38:22] dude-x: base page objects have utility functions to create strings, open a file, get a timestamp, deal with troublesome dropdowns
[2015-05-08 12:39:27] kyoob: any advantage over creating a utility class and calling that?
[2015-05-08 12:39:37] kyoob: i guess you have to pass the driver around in that case
[2015-05-08 12:40:13] dude-x: you can have a separate utility class
[2015-05-08 12:40:30] dude-x: logically, base page object has functions that help with real page objects
[2015-05-08 12:40:40] dude-x: utility class should have stuff that doesn't fit into base page neatly.
[2015-05-08 12:41:04] kyoob: like utility.closeAllTheseOpenPopups()
[2015-05-08 12:41:31] dude-x: alerts?
[2015-05-08 12:41:35] dude-x: javascript alerts? nah
[2015-05-08 12:41:44] dude-x: you have to handle that differently
[2015-05-08 12:41:44] kyoob: no, just new windows/tabs
[2015-05-08 12:41:51] dude-x: oh.
[2015-05-08 12:42:01] dude-x: well for an automated test it should clean up properly
[2015-05-08 12:42:48] kyoob: i like to keep the same browser open between some tests
[2015-05-08 12:43:07] dude-x: since i use FF, i keep the same browser open for all tests locally
[2015-05-08 12:43:14] dude-x: otherwise i use sauce and have my code shutdown the driver
[2015-05-08 12:43:42] kyoob: what i mean is i usually don't want to driver.close() just to get rid of new tabs
[2015-05-08 12:43:47] kyoob: so i have a little helper
[2015-05-08 12:44:26] dude-x: i wrap my webdriver library so if i call close, it won't close the main window
[2015-05-08 12:44:32] dude-x: or the remaining window i should say.
[2015-05-08 12:44:36] kyoob: ooh sweet
[2015-05-08 12:45:16] kyoob: i wonder if we wrote an open source test suite for, say, google and had everyone in here as a contributor
[2015-05-08 12:45:20] dude-x: in my comments/ i say "use driver.quit to close last window"
[2015-05-08 12:45:32] kyoob: would it end up being a perfect suite, or just very very controversial re: best practices

[2015-05-08 13:11:45] onlywade: ok. maybe try an apt-get update first.
[2015-05-08 13:12:05] onlywade: to be clear, just: sudo apt-get update

[2015-05-08 13:19:26] onlywade: yep, i think any way you can get chrome installed, as long as the binary ends up on the path, will be fine
[2015-05-08 13:20:04] onlywade: if it's a headless server, though, you may wont to consider just running selenium in a docker container
[2015-05-08 13:20:49] Cache_Money: onlywade: I'm not going to use it as a headless server... I just plan to run some python scripts to invoke selenium for a few things
[2015-05-08 13:21:58] onlywade: why not run locally, then? you need your scripts to run continuously, or unattended?

[2015-05-08 14:11:26] dude-x: CSWookie: however you can do something like a script that opens a regular browser using selenium (say with your home profile) and you record the session ID
[2015-05-08 14:11:48] dude-x: then using another script, that selenium can attach to the session ID (this will work in Python)
[2015-05-08 14:14:01] CSWookie: What I'm wanting is to open the browser and then have selenium connect to it, though, because I can't get selenium to successfully open and connect to any firefox > 25.
[2015-05-08 14:14:27] CSWookie: Which makes me sad.  Because I'm really tired of using old versions of firefox.
[2015-05-08 14:14:43] dude-x: you should use ff 31?

[2015-05-08 14:16:47] dude-x: oh
[2015-05-08 14:16:56] dude-x: there are some changes i guess

[2015-05-08 14:19:27] CSWookie: That's the puke I get when trying to open 36 on win7 using selenium 2.45
[2015-05-08 14:19:45] dude-x: isn't 37 the latest?
[2015-05-08 14:19:50] dude-x: have you tried 31?
[2015-05-08 14:20:11] CSWookie: We don't support 37 yet, do we?  and yes.
[2015-05-08 14:20:53] CSWookie: I think the problem is the blocklist being disabled.  Whatever that means.
[2015-05-08 14:21:45] onlywade: Cache_Money: I haven't ran selenium *directly* on an EC2 instance, but I've used the docker images there with no problems.
[2015-05-08 14:21:54] onlywade: you can find them here: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium
[2015-05-08 14:22:28] onlywade: and for example, start the standalone-chrome image, and then just point your scripts to the EC2 host on port 4444 and fire away.
[2015-05-08 14:22:52] onlywade: you do need to make sure that the instance is in a security group which exposes that port to your client host.
[2015-05-08 14:26:39] Cache_Money: onlywade: gotcha.  I haven't used Docker yet..
[2015-05-08 14:27:57] onlywade: yeah, and i understand if you're not wanting to take that leap or whatnot, just an idea. it really shouldn't be too bad to set up selenium "from scratch" there, anyway.
[2015-05-08 14:28:01] onlywade: good luck!
