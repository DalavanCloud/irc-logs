[2015-05-11 03:02:40] Dave_B_: :)
[2015-05-11 03:02:44] aj4u: was wondering if there was some selenium best practices
[2015-05-11 03:02:48] Dave_B_: I have a (vague) memory
[2015-05-11 03:02:51] aj4u: when making websites etc
[2015-05-11 03:03:17] aj4u: sorry
[2015-05-11 03:03:24] aj4u: framework for big websites
[2015-05-11 03:03:31] aj4u: my terminology isn't great as of y3et
[2015-05-11 03:03:33] aj4u: yet*
[2015-05-11 03:03:44] aj4u: Ps. the css tuts helped
[2015-05-11 03:03:48] Dave_B_: For when making websites? Not specifically, just follow normal best practises on things like markup and dom structure etc, keeps automation easy
[2015-05-11 03:03:53] Dave_B_: ah cool, I'm glad :)
[2015-05-11 03:04:02] Dave_B_: for when maknig automation frameworks...
[2015-05-11 03:04:27] Dave_B_: page object model is very useful (not sure if it's strictly 'best practise' but probably should be)
[2015-05-11 03:04:52] Dave_B_: explicit waits also should be best practise rather than implicit
[2015-05-11 03:05:55] Dave_B_: normal software dev practises apply in general, so making sure you avoid lots of duplicate code etc etc

[2015-05-11 03:15:33] WhereIsMySpoon: ask for a raise
[2015-05-11 03:15:36] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-05-11 03:15:39] Dave_B_: :D
[2015-05-11 03:15:55] Dave_B_: may as well, if I'm stuck doing it I may as well get the compensation!
[2015-05-11 03:16:29] WhereIsMySpoon: like in your next review or w/e, say that you're doing jobs that would normally get better compensation e.g. person 1/role X and that you think you deserve to be bumped to that level

[2015-05-11 03:16:59] WhereIsMySpoon: depends how good a rapport u got with ur management
[2015-05-11 03:22:28] Dave_B_: well, my line manager recently got the boot...

[2015-05-11 10:19:05] titusfortner: capybara is a test framework similar to Watir. Both rely on WebDriver to interact with the browser
[2015-05-11 10:22:27] titusfortner: Also, I haven't read any truly compelling reasons to use Phantomjs over Chrome (using xvfb if you need headless)

[2015-05-11 10:25:18] ghanima: titusfortner: I need to run headless for my testing and phantomjs seems to be the perferred option for remote headless
[2015-05-11 10:25:47] titusfortner: I run headless using xvfb (which is easy on Linux, harder on Mac)
[2015-05-11 10:27:09] titusfortner: ah, but you said remotely, so it could depend on your limitations of the remote box
[2015-05-11 10:27:28] ghanima: titusfortner: What I am trying to do is using phantomjs --webdriver=port#
[2015-05-11 10:27:35] ghanima: on the remote machine
[2015-05-11 10:27:55] ghanima: and then from my local machine submit Selenium test th that remote machine

[2015-05-11 10:28:23] ghanima: but now I am trying to decide... If I have the test working in Selenium is there any points of moving it to capybara

[2015-05-11 10:29:12] titusfortner: I assume capybara will give similar advantages
[2015-05-11 10:29:44] ghanima: titusfortner: Waitr does this require qt-toolkit
[2015-05-11 10:31:08] titusfortner: No, Watir is just a gem that uses webdriver, but provides a more flexible interface for writing tests.

[2015-05-11 22:04:58] AutomatedTester: HowardwLo: what happens when you change EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, '//*[text()[contains(.,\'load more\')]]')) to EC.presence_of_element_located(driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[text()[contains(.,\'load more\')]]'))
[2015-05-11 22:05:57] HowardwLo: AutomatedTester: i’ll try that out and report back! i never know when it’ll die, but thanks!
[2015-05-11 22:06:49] AutomatedTester: hmmm looking at the code, you were right
[2015-05-11 22:07:17] AutomatedTester: can you use pdb at see where it is hanging?
[2015-05-11 22:07:23] HowardwLo: pdb at?
[2015-05-11 22:07:56] AutomatedTester: s/at//
[2015-05-11 22:08:05] HowardwLo: i have a print statement above the EC.presense…. and a print statement below it. The print before comes out, so it’s def. hanging on that line
[2015-05-11 22:08:07] AutomatedTester: to see where it is hanging
[2015-05-11 22:08:16] HowardwLo: im unfamiliar with pdb :(
[2015-05-11 22:08:32] AutomatedTester: today is a good day to learn :)
[2015-05-11 22:08:55] AutomatedTester: your print, in the example, is after the wait
[2015-05-11 22:09:09] AutomatedTester: and then you tell it to sleep for 1 hour

[2015-05-11 22:10:15] AutomatedTester: HowardwLo: I can't see why it would hang indefinitely. What OS and browser are you using?
[2015-05-11 22:10:30] HowardwLo: osx 10.9
[2015-05-11 22:10:43] HowardwLo: i run the selenium on FireFox(), on PhantomJS()
[2015-05-11 22:10:56] HowardwLo: FireFox is like a guarantee death actually, so maybe I can test on that one
[2015-05-11 22:11:04] HowardwLo: but PhantomJS() dies randomly
[2015-05-11 22:11:20] HowardwLo: i don’t recall running into any problems on Chrome()

[2015-05-11 22:12:58] AutomatedTester: HowardwLo: I am around for a little bit :)
[2015-05-11 22:13:30] HowardwLo: AutomatedTester: thanks! any hints on a quickstart ? :)
[2015-05-11 22:13:56] AutomatedTester: HowardwLo: above the wait put |import pdb; pdb.set_trace()|
[2015-05-11 22:14:09] AutomatedTester: rin your code and hopefully it will hit the breakpoint
[2015-05-11 22:15:51] HowardwLo: yes it did :) (Pdb)
[2015-05-11 22:16:51] HowardwLo: looks like i’ll just step through it
[2015-05-11 22:17:08] AutomatedTester: s to step into the wait
[2015-05-11 22:17:21] AutomatedTester: and n to step over
[2015-05-11 22:19:49] HowardwLo: jesus! there’s a lot to step through
[2015-05-11 22:21:43] HowardwLo: AutomatedTester: ok, i htink i found the endless loop :|
[2015-05-11 22:21:59] AutomatedTester: ok, where?

[2015-05-11 22:22:19] HowardwLo: pasting it

[2015-05-11 22:23:44] AutomatedTester: HowardwLo: is this working properly on other machines?
[2015-05-11 22:23:57] HowardwLo: AutomatedTester: negative
[2015-05-11 22:24:26] HowardwLo: on firefox (which is my primary selenium browser for headless) it completely doesn’t work
[2015-05-11 22:24:55] AutomatedTester: HowardwLo: if that's the endless loop then there is something wrong with the network stack affecting selenium
[2015-05-11 22:25:34] HowardwLo: AutomatedTester: any chance i could be using pdb wrong?
[2015-05-11 22:25:54] HowardwLo: if not, then what does that mean? :D
[2015-05-11 22:26:33] AutomatedTester: instead of using s in the socket code or code that looks like it's doing the http calls use |n|
[2015-05-11 22:26:44] AutomatedTester: and that way you dont step into as much code

[2015-05-11 22:29:25] HowardwLo: ya
[2015-05-11 22:29:37] AutomatedTester: then it must be the 1 hour long sleep afterwards
[2015-05-11 22:29:55] AutomatedTester: time.sleep(3600) takes seconds as a parameter

[2015-05-11 22:35:35] AutomatedTester: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-05-11 22:35:49] HowardwLo: is this programming?! :D
[2015-05-11 22:35:50] AutomatedTester: at least you learned how to debug python code
[2015-05-11 22:36:03] AutomatedTester: so its not a complete waste of time
