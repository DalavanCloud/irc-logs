[2015-05-26 04:14:31] AutomatedTester: my brain has gone blank on why this isnt working in a classmethod
[2015-05-26 04:15:31] pte_petey: well i added 30
[2015-05-26 04:15:38] pte_petey: it should work right
[2015-05-26 04:16:21] AutomatedTester: yes, but I suspect the problem is related to classmethod usage not a specific webdriver issue

[2015-05-26 04:26:46] AutomatedTester: pte_petey: have you made a virtualenv?
[2015-05-26 04:26:54] pte_petey: not yet
[2015-05-26 04:27:13] AutomatedTester: pte_petey: my suggestion would be to make a virtualenv and use pip
[2015-05-26 04:27:24] AutomatedTester: and not bother with brew
[2015-05-26 04:27:56] pte_petey: hmm ok
[2015-05-26 04:28:13] pte_petey: i only used brew because there was some conflict in other instalations of python
[2015-05-26 04:28:26] pte_petey: ^^ thanks it will be my first automated testing role
[2015-05-26 04:28:32] pte_petey: i've done manual for years
[2015-05-26 04:30:19] AutomatedTester: reasons for using virtualenv + pip 1) I am the module owner for the selenium python project and release to pip and don't actively support brew 2) in a CI environment you want the best cross platform support (brew is OSX only) 3) it's easier to blow away virtualenvs and start again if you are in a bad place
[2015-05-26 04:30:40] pte_petey: that's true
[2015-05-26 04:30:45] pte_petey: I've used it a couple of times before
[2015-05-26 04:30:50] pte_petey: but I'm not super confident with it

[2015-05-26 04:34:21] pte_petey: but I tried self.implicit_wait(30) and nothing happened
[2015-05-26 04:34:49] AutomatedTester: implicit_waits only work on find_element(s)
[2015-05-26 04:36:22] pte_petey: like this ? self.search_field.find_element_by_id('').implicit_wait(30)

[2015-05-26 04:37:08] AutomatedTester: so once you set it you can do find_element type calls

[2015-05-26 04:37:55] AutomatedTester: yup
[2015-05-26 04:38:12] AutomatedTester: but the reason your test fails is not because it can't find the element, it things the value is not set
[2015-05-26 04:38:19] AutomatedTester: actually... that is the issue with your test
[2015-05-26 04:38:23] pte_petey: ok
[2015-05-26 04:38:38] AutomatedTester: it's an input so you need to do get_attribute('value') not .text

[2015-05-26 04:47:38] pte_petey: ok

[2015-05-26 04:48:00] AutomatedTester: one sec while i make a sample page for you
[2015-05-26 04:48:01] ajay123: AutomatedTester: i tried to import my model but it is empty when i tried MyModel.objects.all()
[2015-05-26 04:48:18] AutomatedTester: ajay123: that sounds like a django issue

[2015-05-26 04:48:50] ajay123: AutomatedTester: and how am i supposed to work that out?
[2015-05-26 04:49:22] AutomatedTester: :google django import model for test
[2015-05-26 04:49:37] AutomatedTester: ajay123: ^ looks like a good place to start

[2015-05-26 04:52:08] AutomatedTester: pte_petey: so in that example we dont have a value attribute but if you type in it one is created by the browser

[2015-05-26 04:53:47] AutomatedTester: pte_petey: automation will require you to understand a little how the DOM works

[2015-05-26 04:54:52] AutomatedTester: yup

[2015-05-26 04:56:01] pte_petey: exlicit is conditional
[2015-05-26 04:56:08] pte_petey: implicit is handled by the server
[2015-05-26 04:56:13] pte_petey: or something like that
[2015-05-26 04:56:13] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-26 04:56:24] pte_petey: so explicit is flawed in the same way Thread.sleep() is
[2015-05-26 04:56:25] AutomatedTester: but why would I not want it done on the server side?
[2015-05-26 04:56:44] pte_petey: because you're testing the client domain ?
[2015-05-26 04:57:06] pte_petey: and I guess it comes down to syncronicity ?
[2015-05-26 04:57:18] AutomatedTester: it comes down to control
[2015-05-26 04:57:27] AutomatedTester: automated tests need to be deterministic
[2015-05-26 04:58:12] AutomatedTester: in your example you had a setupClass that set up implicit waits and then you had 3 tests
[2015-05-26 04:58:33] AutomatedTester: what if the middle test set the implicit wait to 0 and your tests started failing
[2015-05-26 04:59:00] pte_petey: thats true
[2015-05-26 04:59:23] pte_petey: so it's about the granularity of timing
[2015-05-26 04:59:44] pte_petey: i thought the classmethod locks you out from method specific timings?
[2015-05-26 05:00:16] AutomatedTester: no, you have set it across the wire
[2015-05-26 05:00:23] AutomatedTester: it's a fire and forget type call
[2015-05-26 05:00:37] AutomatedTester: my rules for test automation
[2015-05-26 05:00:40] AutomatedTester: * Test should follow these rules:

[2015-05-26 05:00:42] AutomatedTester: 	*  - Should put the system back into a known state

[2015-05-26 08:23:21] WhereIsMySpoon: anton2k: and a car going at 150mph is better than one going 80?
[2015-05-26 08:23:29] anton2k: not at all
[2015-05-26 08:23:35] WhereIsMySpoon: well then

[2015-05-26 08:32:29] D3M0S: rorycb, Danstar Nottingham Ale Yeast
[2015-05-26 08:33:37] rorycb: D3M0S: Interesting. I have been thinking about trying it at home, there are so many opinions about the 'right' yeast :)
[2015-05-26 08:34:03] D3M0S: rorycb, I just took the word of my local HBS, it turned out really well.
[2015-05-26 08:34:14] rorycb: D3M0S: sweet or dry?
[2015-05-26 08:35:02] D3M0S: rorycb, mine was a little different, I added an extra pound of corn sugar
[2015-05-26 08:35:06] D3M0S: to make it more dry
[2015-05-26 08:35:24] D3M0S: then I added a pound of Lactose to make it sweet
[2015-05-26 08:35:38] D3M0S: so the Lactose is an unfermentable sugar
[2015-05-26 08:35:46] rorycb: D3M0S: oh interesting. I'll pick your brain if I get around to doing it.
[2015-05-26 08:36:14] rorycb: I have a grapefuit honey ale fermenting at the moment
[2015-05-26 08:36:31] D3M0S: yeah Lactose will give it a lot of body, so I made it a little more dry to compensave for that.

[2015-05-26 09:38:41] pte_petey: my book recommends div.header-minicart

[2015-05-26 09:38:54] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: oh, and of course, they insist on not storing authorization info via a browser-visible cookie.
[2015-05-26 09:39:11] pte_petey: but from what I can see (probably nievely) it doesn't make sense under the css selectors
[2015-05-26 09:39:25] WhereIsMySpoon: div.header-minicart?
[2015-05-26 09:39:28] WhereIsMySpoon: div is a tagname

[2015-05-26 09:40:07] WhereIsMySpoon: pte_petey: looks like you could just do "skip-link.skip-cart.no-count"
[2015-05-26 09:40:09] WhereIsMySpoon: uh

[2015-05-26 09:41:18] WhereIsMySpoon: do what i just said

[2015-05-26 09:52:23] pte_petey: should i remove implciit waits in favour of explicit?

[2015-05-26 09:52:40] WhereIsMySpoon: you'll need to code in explicit waits tho

[2015-05-26 09:55:52] titusfortner: I can't imagine coding in Java again after switching to Ruby. :)
[2015-05-26 09:55:53] D3M0S: I'm sure it's fine, but I have like....ruby ptsd
[2015-05-26 09:55:56] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2015-05-26 09:56:02] WhereIsMySpoon: sounds like something weird happened there then
[2015-05-26 09:56:06] WhereIsMySpoon: ruby is super awesome
[2015-05-26 09:56:09] WhereIsMySpoon: rails even more so

[2015-05-26 09:56:26] WhereIsMySpoon: speaking of ruby
[2015-05-26 09:56:33] titusfortner: It's also somewhat opinionated in the convention over configuration approach, which people often struggle with :-/
[2015-05-26 09:56:36] jimevans: i'd like to have a reason to use python for something but i've got too much java, c# and c++ i'm currently responsible for keeping running.

[2015-05-26 09:56:47] WhereIsMySpoon: lol
[2015-05-26 09:56:47] pte_petey: so will explicit waits solve the css selector problem or is it a cosmetic thing
[2015-05-26 09:57:00] pte_petey: or 'nice to have'
[2015-05-26 09:57:04] D3M0S: so I was like...smashing my head against complex maps trying to get the right answer for 2 weeks, it was just a nightmare
[2015-05-26 09:57:12] WhereIsMySpoon: D3M0S: that sounds shit
[2015-05-26 09:57:35] WhereIsMySpoon: pte_petey: implicit waits are bad as they give u no control over how your selectors work and when you wait and how long
[2015-05-26 09:57:54] pte_petey: so it's all about granularity
[2015-05-26 09:57:56] WhereIsMySpoon: its not cosmetic or "nice to have", its something you should really start doing now
[2015-05-26 09:58:00] jimevans: okay, my network connection is about to go all wonky.
[2015-05-26 09:58:02] pte_petey: so you either have explicit or implicit
[2015-05-26 09:58:10] WhereIsMySpoon: rather than 2 months down the line when you have all ur tests written and dont want to refactor
[2015-05-26 09:58:11] pte_petey: why would you use one and not the other
[2015-05-26 09:58:11] WhereIsMySpoon: yes
[2015-05-26 09:58:14] WhereIsMySpoon: do not mix them ever
[2015-05-26 09:58:30] AutomatedTester: mixing waits is like mixing drinks
[2015-05-26 09:58:37] AutomatedTester: seems like a good idea at the time but never is
[2015-05-26 09:58:37] titusfortner: exponential increase of waits
[2015-05-26 09:58:53] D3M0S: pte_petey, tourdedave just did a good post on this, let me find it
[2015-05-26 09:58:57] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: I have cider + wine for pre drinks then meal drink a lot

[2015-05-26 11:13:17] pte_petey: why would you use web element instead of the regular webdriver class?
[2015-05-26 11:13:35] pte_petey: is it because it exclusively allows you to interact with dynamic elements?
[2015-05-26 11:14:43] D3M0S: pte_petey, in regards to what?
[2015-05-26 11:15:13] pte_petey: i don't know my book didn't give me too much detail on the motivation for one or the other
[2015-05-26 11:15:30] pte_petey: i guess it just offers you more control right ?
[2015-05-26 11:15:39] pte_petey: like navigating forward or back in the browser
[2015-05-26 11:15:50] D3M0S: WebElement usernameField = driver.findElement(By.id("username"));

[2015-05-26 11:16:09] D3M0S: does that make sense?
[2015-05-26 11:16:30] D3M0S: you can also navigate down WebElements
[2015-05-26 11:16:56] D3M0S: WebElement loginDiv = driver.findElement(By.tagname("div"));
[2015-05-26 11:17:24] D3M0S: WebElement loginButton = loginDiv.findElement(By.tagname("button"));

[2015-05-26 11:17:56] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-26 11:18:16] pte_petey: can you not navigate down without web elements?
[2015-05-26 11:18:34] AutomatedTester: pte_petey: scroll down?
[2015-05-26 11:18:38] D3M0S: pte_petey, you can think of it like this...WebDriver is kindof like starting at the top of the DOM, while WebElements are centric on DOM nodes
[2015-05-26 11:18:53] pte_petey: ah that makes a lot more sense
[2015-05-26 11:19:03] andy_seit, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-26 11:19:07] pte_petey: so bottom up vs top down
[2015-05-26 11:19:40] AutomatedTester: pte_petey: find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "body").send_keys(Keys.SPACE)
[2015-05-26 11:19:45] AutomatedTester: that will allow you to scrool
[2015-05-26 11:19:48] D3M0S: sortof, because the DOM is basically a tree, and all webdriver really does is allow you to traverse that tree, and do certian actions on tree nodes
[2015-05-26 11:19:55] barancev: AutomatedTester: btw, how is it supposed to distribute http bridge to marionette? is it going to be embedded to the browser?
[2015-05-26 11:20:15] pte_petey: hmm
[2015-05-26 11:20:31] pte_petey: so with webelements you navigate at the same height
[2015-05-26 11:20:33] D3M0S: WebDriver also gives you the normal browser control functions, like navigating to a webpage or hitting the back button.
[2015-05-26 11:20:35] pte_petey: working upwards

[2015-05-26 11:20:51] AutomatedTester: barancev: we will have an executable like IEDriver and ChromeDriver
[2015-05-26 11:20:52] Padawan_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-05-26 11:21:04] D3M0S: think of it like this, you're constraining the scope when navigating within a WebElement or node
[2015-05-26 11:21:10] barancev: an executable, ok, cool
[2015-05-26 11:21:15] andy_seit: "D 2015-05-26 14:11:03:236 Browser.cpp(489) document.readyState is not 'complete'; it was interactive" - is ruining my life >_<
[2015-05-26 11:21:19] D3M0S: so you can only find things within that node
[2015-05-26 11:21:26] pte_petey: make sense
[2015-05-26 11:22:18] D3M0S: you might want to go practice a bit, it will make more sense than just academically reading about it
[2015-05-26 11:22:32] D3M0S: a good place to pracitce is tourdedaves "the-internet"
[2015-05-26 11:22:48] D3M0S: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/
[2015-05-26 11:23:00] andy_seit: If I raise an issue against IEDriver, if the repro code only fails 30% of the time, will that be okay?
[2015-05-26 11:23:08] andy_seit: (+1 for the-internet)
[2015-05-26 11:24:16] D3M0S: pte_petey, https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login would be a pretty easy place to do some simple webdriver actions

[2015-05-26 11:27:29] D3M0S: you can kindof garner how the WebDriver works with those code examples
[2015-05-26 11:27:54] D3M0S: and then try to make it input the correct username and password on "the-internet" and hit the login button

[2015-05-26 11:28:22] D3M0S: then play around with navigating the dom, a good challenge would be to do the same thing, but don't allow yourself to use ids
[2015-05-26 11:28:52] D3M0S: the differences between WebDriver and WebElement should become fairly obvious at that point

[2015-05-26 11:30:15] D3M0S: so another good challenge there would be to do the login stuff again, but extract the stuff into page objects and try writing your login test using them.
[2015-05-26 11:30:33] pte_petey: cool :)
[2015-05-26 11:30:52] pte_petey: thx man
[2015-05-26 11:31:17] D3M0S: no worries, if you have Page Object Pattern down, you'll have a leg up on 90% of the competition out there
[2015-05-26 11:32:05] D3M0S: even better, if you can explain why the company should be using Page Object Pattern...if they don't ask you about it, you'll probably get hired easily.

[2015-05-26 11:34:27] pte_petey: the way i understand from the outset is it's a bit like the .net style of providing dynamic web content
[2015-05-26 11:34:36] pte_petey: but it's really just a wrapper class
[2015-05-26 11:34:51] pte_petey: so you  only see services
[2015-05-26 11:34:54] pte_petey: or content
[2015-05-26 11:34:58] pte_petey: not the implementation
[2015-05-26 11:35:11] pte_petey: that's robably rediculously vague and incorrect at this stage
[2015-05-26 11:35:17] D3M0S: that's a big part of it, or moreso, a good wayt o implement it
[2015-05-26 11:36:08] D3M0S: it's mostly a common location to put all your locators, so your tests aren't constantly redefining the same things
[2015-05-26 11:36:41] D3M0S: locator basically == .findElement()
[2015-05-26 11:36:56] D3M0S: so you don't want to really be "finding" anything within your tests
[2015-05-26 11:37:19] D3M0S: you want those in a different layer

[2015-05-26 11:50:21] D3M0S: pte_petey, no, its a layer of protection to enhance the maintainability of your tests, it also can make writing tests for less experienced coders much simpler, if designed correctly
[2015-05-26 11:50:32] pte_petey: ok
[2015-05-26 11:50:38] D3M0S: so if I have 1000 tests, and they all login
[2015-05-26 11:51:09] D3M0S: so they all do this...driver.findElement(By.id("username").sendKeys("JoeSlappy");
[2015-05-26 11:51:40] D3M0S: now when sometime in the future the username field id gets changed to "usrname" or something like that
[2015-05-26 11:51:45] D3M0S: you need to go fix 1000 tests
[2015-05-26 11:51:53] D3M0S: if they were all doing something like this:
[2015-05-26 11:52:01] D3M0S: LoginPage login = new LoginPage();
[2015-05-26 11:52:15] D3M0S: login.username("JoeSlappy");
[2015-05-26 11:52:26] D3M0S: now if the same scenario happens
[2015-05-26 11:52:33] D3M0S: you just need to go fix the LoginPage page object
[2015-05-26 11:52:38] D3M0S: and all 1000 tests are fixed

[2015-05-26 12:43:03] sbonami: Hi, I have a problem with Selenium Server. In my test suite HTML file, I have a line like this to include a test case: <tr><td><a href="../TestCases/TestCase.html">TestCase</a></td></tr>
[2015-05-26 12:43:17] sbonami: but when running the test suite with java command, I have a 404 error that it's not finding RequestURI=/selenium-server/TestCases/TestCase.html
[2015-05-26 12:43:52] sbonami: Why is it searching for the folder TestCases inside a folder called "selenium-server?
[2015-05-26 12:51:20] D3M0S: well when you do../ it moves you back one direcotry, does that land you in the selenium-server directory?
[2015-05-26 12:56:13] sbonami: it seems that yes, but I don't want to
[2015-05-26 12:56:40] sbonami: I want to be in the directory where the folder TestCases is
[2015-05-26 12:57:41] sbonami: I have 2 folders at the same level: TestSuites and TestCases
[2015-05-26 12:58:07] sbonami: so my test suites are in TestSuites and my test cases are in TestCases (it's clean for me that way)
[2015-05-26 12:58:44] D3M0S: sbonami, try <a href="./TestCases/TestCase.html">TestCase</a>
[2015-05-26 13:01:09] D3M0S: ./ means work within the current folder
[2015-05-26 13:02:44] sbonami: it can't work because the folder TestCases is not within the current folder (TestSuites)
[2015-05-26 13:03:58] sbonami: it works btw with IDE as ../ is well interpreted
[2015-05-26 13:05:49] D3M0S: you might want to fully qualify the location then.
[2015-05-26 13:07:23] sbonami: this would work, but not an option for me because these files are in a git repo and people can clone it and put it where they want

[2015-05-26 13:08:42] sbonami: it's a java question?
[2015-05-26 13:09:29] sbonami: the command I'm using is: java -jar C:\Selenium\selenium-server-standalone-2.45.0.jar -htmlSuite "*firefox" "http://www.google.com" "TestSuite.html" "selenium-results.html"
[2015-05-26 13:09:30] D3M0S: yeah...it just happens to interpolate your into the selenium-server directory for whatever reason.

[2015-05-26 16:10:31] dude-x: protip: enumerate(communes, 1)
[2015-05-26 16:10:38] dude-x: save yourself from doing +1
[2015-05-26 16:11:04] youssef: ok thanks for the trick
[2015-05-26 16:11:28] dude-x: this code would read better if you use css selectors
[2015-05-26 16:11:46] dude-x: xcodecommune = ‘#xcodecommune{}’.format(i)
[2015-05-26 16:12:36] dude-x: value = browser.find_element_by_css_selector(xcodecommune).get_attribute(‘value’)
[2015-05-26 16:13:36] youssef: yes this is because, there are some hiddent fields named xcodecommune1, xcodecommune2, etc....
[2015-05-26 16:14:00] dude-x: so you want to get all the elements that have xcodecommune# right?
[2015-05-26 16:14:12] youssef: no
[2015-05-26 16:14:53] youssef: at the end of the script there is a while(1)
[2015-05-26 16:15:26] youssef: and the last instructione is : browser.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@class="next"]').click()
[2015-05-26 16:15:51] dude-x: so only the last part is giving you trouble?
[2015-05-26 16:15:58] youssef: ye
[2015-05-26 16:15:59] youssef: yes
[2015-05-26 16:16:06] youssef: there are 15 pages
[2015-05-26 16:16:45] youssef: the idea is to gets all items of the current page
[2015-05-26 16:16:46] youssef: then
[2015-05-26 16:17:06] youssef: click each then there is a '.next' button
[2015-05-26 16:17:09] dude-x: alright so this what is going to happen when you run line 41
[2015-05-26 16:17:18] dude-x: you say to wait for all elements to be located is avaialble
[2015-05-26 16:17:30] dude-x: the problem is if there is 1 element located
[2015-05-26 16:17:39] dude-x: then you will get back a list of 1 element
[2015-05-26 16:17:46] dude-x: if there are 15
[2015-05-26 16:17:50] dude-x: you may get 15
[2015-05-26 16:17:55] dude-x: it all depends
[2015-05-26 16:18:02] dude-x: on how the page is loading the list of links
[2015-05-26 16:18:21] youssef: this is ajax loaded
[2015-05-26 16:18:23] dude-x: so you will have to know what happens on the page when all items are loaded
[2015-05-26 16:19:12] dude-x: then you can print all the links properly
[2015-05-26 16:19:55] youssef: i can already print all the links of the first result page
[2015-05-26 16:19:56] dude-x: but anyway that WebdriverWait you have in line 41 is a race condition in that not all items may not be completely loaded.
[2015-05-26 16:20:09] dude-x: so line 44 doesn’t work?
[2015-05-26 16:21:17] youssef: line 44 work because i'm able to reach the second page but i'm having a error
[2015-05-26 16:21:29] dude-x: what’s the error?
[2015-05-26 16:21:54] youssef: ok let me go back to pastbin
[2015-05-26 16:22:29] youssef: http://pastebin.com/dUTq1ysv
[2015-05-26 16:22:58] youssef: i think it has something to happen with the page loading
[2015-05-26 16:24:17] youssef: sorry for my bad english :)
[2015-05-26 16:24:48] dude-x: ah
[2015-05-26 16:24:52] dude-x: element not visiible
[2015-05-26 16:25:14] dude-x: just use a webdriver-wait and wait for element to be visible
[2015-05-26 16:25:19] dude-x: then the click should suceed
[2015-05-26 16:25:42] youssef: ok i will try
[2015-05-26 16:25:47] youssef: right now :)
[2015-05-26 16:26:51] youssef: how to wait for an element to be visible ?
[2015-05-26 16:26:56] dude-x: yes
[2015-05-26 16:27:24] dude-x: most likely as you’re cycling through these things, the DOM is still being updated
[2015-05-26 16:27:31] lukeis: :waits
[2015-05-26 16:27:32] dude-x: so while the button exists, it hasn’t finished rendering
[2015-05-26 16:28:08] lukeis: (coincidentally wanted the link… not following the current conversation… ;) )
[2015-05-26 16:29:10] dude-x: haha
[2015-05-26 16:29:18] dude-x: well time for me to go home.
