[2015-05-14 10:09:18] andy_seit7: I always use xpath. Im not popular.
[2015-05-14 10:09:29] *jleyba would just grab all the nobr with css and check text client side'
[2015-05-14 10:09:42] jc2121: I wasn't aware you could use it for that.  I'll try lukeis's example.

[2015-05-14 10:10:20] jimevans: andy_seit7: xpath can be used effectively, but most people don't. their xpath locators are brittle, fragile things that can't withstand the first minor change to things.
[2015-05-14 10:10:21] jimevans: :)

[2015-05-14 10:12:42] lukeis: jc2121: yes
[2015-05-14 10:13:11] jc2121: Or anyone?  Not sure of the syntax for finding content by its text.
[2015-05-14 10:13:18] jc2121: Excited about it!
[2015-05-14 10:13:31] jc2121: Cool.  Thx!
[2015-05-14 10:13:44] lukeis: if it's not an exact match of the textâ€¦ try "//nobr[contains(., 'my text')]"
[2015-05-14 10:13:54] jimevans: of course, finding an element by the text contained within it sounds rather suspect for long-term maintenance.
[2015-05-14 10:13:55] jc2121: Awesome
