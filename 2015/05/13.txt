[2015-05-13 03:45:43] AutomatedTester: davehunt_: good use
[2015-05-13 03:46:14] AutomatedTester: davehunt_: wonder if they use Selenium then :)

[2015-05-13 08:20:34] ato: There have been many discussions backwards and forwards on this, but it’s unclear to me what people consider the fundamental pieces and what is sugar.
[2015-05-13 08:20:48] simonstewart: Right

[2015-05-13 08:22:00] simonstewart: What's currently broken?
[2015-05-13 08:22:12] barancev: sendKeys is a sugar? hm...
[2015-05-13 08:22:52] barancev: what's instead? a series of keyDown+keyUp actions?
[2015-05-13 08:22:56] barancev: no...
[2015-05-13 08:23:23] barancev: simonstewart: sauce incompatibility
[2015-05-13 08:23:50] simonstewart: sendKeys definitely isn't sugar
[2015-05-13 08:23:53] barancev: it does not run our linux jobs
[2015-05-13 08:23:54] simonstewart: It's a "do what I mean" API
[2015-05-13 08:24:16] ato: That’s not what I meant.
[2015-05-13 08:24:27] barancev: simonstewart: I mean sendKeys in "advanced user interations api"
[2015-05-13 08:25:01] ato: We should definitely have sendKeys for brevity’s sake.

[2015-05-13 08:25:47] barancev: there is no sendKeys action in the spec, yes
[2015-05-13 08:25:58] simonstewart: Indeed.
[2015-05-13 08:26:02] barancev: why?
[2015-05-13 08:26:22] simonstewart: Because you have everything you need for the "do what I mean" APIs with keydown and keyup
[2015-05-13 08:26:55] barancev: so you have to break an action chain if you want to type something
[2015-05-13 08:27:39] simonstewart: eh?
[2015-05-13 08:27:58] barancev: new Actions(driver).click(element).sendKeys("test").perform() is not posible
[2015-05-13 08:28:10] simonstewart: There's nothing to prevent you having a nice API over the top of the lower-level stuff
[2015-05-13 08:28:17] jimevans: barancev: don't confuse the webdriver client api with marionette's client-side api.
[2015-05-13 08:28:19] simonstewart: So your example is entirely possible
[2015-05-13 08:28:23] barancev: that's what I meant to say

[2015-05-13 08:28:53] barancev: a client (binding) should send a series of keyDown+keyUp adtions in place of sendKeys

[2015-05-13 08:29:30] simonstewart: If you're using the actions api, yes
[2015-05-13 08:29:50] barancev: are you serious?
[2015-05-13 08:30:34] simonstewart: Entirely.
[2015-05-13 08:30:39] barancev: do we really want all bindings implement this conversion of a string to a set of keyDown+keyUp actions

[2015-05-13 08:31:05] simonstewart: One moment. Someone at my desk
[2015-05-13 08:31:11] jimevans: barancev: they'll all have to do translation. in the w3c spec, there's only one actions end point.
[2015-05-13 08:31:52] barancev: yes, but what action should be put in the chain?
[2015-05-13 08:32:12] barancev: a single sendKeys or a bunch of keyDown+keyup?
[2015-05-13 08:32:41] jimevans: has to be keydown/up pairs. has to be. that's the only primitives there are for keyboard actions.
[2015-05-13 08:32:52] jimevans: and look, that's dead-simple code to write.
[2015-05-13 08:32:53] barancev: omg...
[2015-05-13 08:33:01] jimevans: for a language binding, anywah.
[2015-05-13 08:33:01] barancev: poor binding developers
[2015-05-13 08:33:10] fabrice31, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-05-13 08:33:37] barancev: and no click for the same reason, right?
[2015-05-13 08:33:51] barancev: no click action in the spec
[2015-05-13 08:34:02] jimevans: foreach (char c in keyString) { // add action keydown and keyup }. it's really not that burdensome.
[2015-05-13 08:35:00] barancev: actually it must be bit more sophisticated
[2015-05-13 08:35:06] barancev: uppercase letters

[2015-05-13 08:35:15] jimevans: but honestly, not much
[2015-05-13 08:35:18] barancev: must be converted to shift key down
[2015-05-13 08:35:48] barancev: and shift key releasing after the end of sendKeys
[2015-05-13 08:36:05] barancev: it would be more fair to delete sendKeys from the cline t Actions API
[2015-05-13 08:36:10] barancev: *client
[2015-05-13 08:36:37] jimevans: which language bindings developers are free to do.
[2015-05-13 08:36:46] barancev: as well as click
[2015-05-13 08:37:25] barancev: because, you know, click is actually moveTo+poiterDown+pointerUp

[2015-05-13 08:41:09] barancev: should the current element be tracked someway by a binding too?

[2015-05-13 08:42:41] simonstewart: The browser should send the keyboard input to whatever currently has focus
[2015-05-13 08:42:45] jimevans: the spec formatting needs to be cleaned up there
[2015-05-13 08:42:54] barancev: there is no choice

[2015-05-13 08:46:39] barancev: new Actions().moveTo(element).keyDown().perform()
[2015-05-13 08:47:01] kyoob: probably best to give pointerDown an optional x,y because much of the world is tapping instead of clicking these days
[2015-05-13 08:47:06] barancev: what to pass to pointerDown backend?
[2015-05-13 08:47:59] barancev: element? no, the client can't recognize what's the actual current element
[2015-05-13 08:48:12] barancev: coordinates? how to track them?
[2015-05-13 08:48:50] barancev: I'd say it should "call" pointerDown backend without parameters
[2015-05-13 08:48:52] jimevans: i'm quite sure that this part of the spec will be undergoing a fair amount of revision. note that the last sentence before the action descriptions says, in part, "pointerDown must accept the parameters that pointerMove does"
[2015-05-13 08:49:34] barancev: ok, thanks, now I got a better picture
[2015-05-13 08:50:12] *barancev is heading to implement sendKeys action as a series of keyDown+keyUp'
[2015-05-13 08:51:26] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: seen as thats how the actual input works for humans, makes sense

[2015-05-13 08:53:25] WhereIsMySpoon: why? seen as selenium already does actions stuff anyway it would make sense for it to just call that stuff
[2015-05-13 08:54:27] barancev: because backend changes
[2015-05-13 08:54:36] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2015-05-13 08:54:37] barancev: and you can't "just call"

[2015-05-13 09:40:17] lukeis: i think it's basically going to be a team event for us jimevans ;) well, aside personal matters i suppose :)
[2015-05-13 09:40:32] lukeis: that doesn't mean you can't go!

[2015-05-13 09:41:39] WhereIsMySpoon: D3M0S: use a website that isnt shit
[2015-05-13 09:41:46] jimevans: marmotworks: :)

[2015-05-13 09:43:10] WhereIsMySpoon: firefox maybe
[2015-05-13 09:43:11] D3M0S: the only time I could see it being worthwhile is when you're an image hosting service and dont want people downloading the image
[2015-05-13 09:43:17] WhereIsMySpoon: D3M0S: hahahahahahahaha
[2015-05-13 09:43:22] D3M0S: WhereIsMySpoon, I did
[2015-05-13 09:43:23] WhereIsMySpoon: there are other ways to get around that
[2015-05-13 09:43:42] D3M0S: WhereIsMySpoon, I know, you can about:config in firefox to disable that
[2015-05-13 09:43:44] WhereIsMySpoon: disabling right clicking to stop that is some middle manager's way cause they read a blog about it 2 years ago
[2015-05-13 09:44:32] D3M0S: WhereIsMySpoon, well there's the majority users...then theres the few that if they really want the image...you're not really doing to stop them
[2015-05-13 09:44:42] D3M0S: going*
[2015-05-13 09:45:07] WhereIsMySpoon: D3M0S: ...printscreen?

[2015-05-13 09:46:33] WhereIsMySpoon: quite
[2015-05-13 09:46:43] D3M0S: it's not like theres really any purpose anyways...its just a stupid confirmation dialog
[2015-05-13 09:46:50] lukeis: WhereIsMySpoon: you can always open the dev tools without right clicking
[2015-05-13 09:46:50] D3M0S: brb, gonna go yell at the devs
[2015-05-13 09:46:58] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis: he cant interact with them tho
[2015-05-13 09:47:07] lukeis:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2015-05-13 09:47:10] WhereIsMySpoon: quite
[2015-05-13 09:47:11] WhereIsMySpoon: so
[2015-05-13 09:47:20] WhereIsMySpoon: i havent seen a website that does that for a few years now
[2015-05-13 09:47:23] D3M0S: lukeis, I have the dev tool open, but it's like clicking anything other than an OKAY or CANCEL button...including dev tools is not allowed
[2015-05-13 09:47:28] WhereIsMySpoon: they used to be popular for a while
[2015-05-13 09:47:34] WhereIsMySpoon: then people got a clue
[2015-05-13 09:48:06] lukeis: that sounds like a javascript "confirm" dialog
[2015-05-13 09:48:28] D3M0S: should I just be using that WebDriver alert handle junk then?

[2015-05-13 09:50:35] WhereIsMySpoon: oh

[2015-05-13 09:50:40] jimevans: if there's a checkbox, it's not an alert
[2015-05-13 09:50:43] D3M0S: doesnt have the dialog

[2015-05-13 09:51:12] WhereIsMySpoon: D3M0S: that's a browser-level config and you'd be testing the browser
[2015-05-13 09:51:15] WhereIsMySpoon: waste of time
[2015-05-13 09:51:27] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: no, i don't agree there.
[2015-05-13 09:51:33] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: how so
[2015-05-13 09:51:35] jimevans: it's not a browser-level alert. it's app code.
[2015-05-13 09:51:41] WhereIsMySpoon: im confused
[2015-05-13 09:51:48] WhereIsMySpoon: its a browser popup
[2015-05-13 09:51:52] D3M0S: yeah I didn't think it was a browser alert
[2015-05-13 09:51:53] WhereIsMySpoon: "do you want me to stop sending alerts at you"
[2015-05-13 09:51:54] jimevans: if it has a "don't show this anymore" it's not a browser alert.
[2015-05-13 09:52:01] WhereIsMySpoon: unless im misunderstanding
[2015-05-13 09:52:06] lukeis: not necessarily
[2015-05-13 09:52:09] jimevans: it's not a standard javascript alert() or cancel()
[2015-05-13 09:52:11] WhereIsMySpoon: D3M0S: is this popup the "do you want me to stop showing you alerts"?
[2015-05-13 09:52:15] lukeis: window.confirm("don't show this anymore")
[2015-05-13 09:52:16] WhereIsMySpoon: or is it something else

[2015-05-13 09:52:39] WhereIsMySpoon: yes
[2015-05-13 09:52:45] D3M0S: is the text next to the checkbox
[2015-05-13 09:52:50] WhereIsMySpoon: thats a browser level thing
[2015-05-13 09:52:55] WhereIsMySpoon: tied to the page
[2015-05-13 09:52:58] lukeis: this very much sounds like Firefox modal dialogs
[2015-05-13 09:52:59] D3M0S: ah, then I wont test that
[2015-05-13 09:53:10] jimevans: ugh.
[2015-05-13 09:53:11] lukeis: use the Alert api to dismiss them
[2015-05-13 09:53:24] D3M0S: lukeis, yep, that sounds right
[2015-05-13 09:53:36] D3M0S: thanks guys..what a pain
[2015-05-13 09:53:37] jimevans: i stand corrected.
[2015-05-13 09:53:48] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: that popup will happen on any page that brings up two alerts in a row
[2015-05-13 09:54:08] WhereIsMySpoon: its just a browser level config and is pointless to test
[2015-05-13 09:54:10] jimevans: and not in a cross-browser way

[2015-05-13 09:57:01] lukeis: i read IOC as Inversion of Control… but don't see how it fits here :)
[2015-05-13 09:57:14] D3M0S: WhereIsMySpoon, I've wired up my framework to be like a WebDriver--Spring combination
[2015-05-13 09:57:29] D3M0S: so I can just use WebDriver in an object whenever

[2015-05-13 10:00:00] D3M0S: WhereIsMySpoon, I did change a bunch of his stuff, because you can use @DirtiesContext set to the test method level instead of using a custom test scope

I don’t believe there is any value in creating large amounts of tests in little time. The value is when

[2015-05-13 10:03:14] WhereIsMySpoon: the closest ive gotten is manual bean definitions in xml or java
[2015-05-13 10:03:18] D3M0S: WhereIsMySpoon, jimevans, he has another pretty good blog post you should read, his only other one, pitty he didnt keep blogging
[2015-05-13 10:03:31] jleyba: WhereIsMySpoon, you don't need a DI container like spring, guice, or dagger to use DI

[2015-05-13 10:04:18] D3M0S: really nicely laid out here
[2015-05-13 10:06:59] D3M0S: I'm thinking I'm going to put out my barebones framework on github and use it to show how to address some of tourdedaves the-internet problems

[2015-05-13 12:00:00] na_th_an: it depends on the expected condition that you use

[2015-05-13 13:24:18] jimevans: Cache_Money: in the sense that your browser can do a POST request, yes. but if you're looking to do raw HTTP requests to a server, Selenium is the wrong tool for the job.
[2015-05-13 13:25:54] Cache_Money: jimevans: Okay.  I thought when I clicked a button it was submitting a form, turns out it is doing a POST request to ".../view_transactions.json"
[2015-05-13 13:26:20] Cache_Money: So, I'm assuming I'll need to pull my cookie out of Selenium then pass that into my Python Requests call... thanks!
[2015-05-13 13:26:38] jimevans: that's what "submitting a form" in a browser often is, sending a POST request.
