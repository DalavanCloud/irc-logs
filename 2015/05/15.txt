[2015-05-15 12:33:34] kyoob: how come when i findElements() for elements that are not on the page, it takes much longer than findElements() when there are elements on the page?
[2015-05-15 12:33:56] jimevans: kyoob: are you using implicit waits?
[2015-05-15 12:34:33] kyoob: nope, just driver.findElements(locator);
[2015-05-15 12:34:45] kyoob: should i set an implicit wait if i expect the size to be 0?
[2015-05-15 12:35:00] jimevans: no, you shouldn't
[2015-05-15 12:35:29] jimevans: the point is that if you're using implicit waits, it'll wait up to the timeout for elements.size() > 0.
[2015-05-15 12:38:20] kyoob: does a css selector take longer to return null than to return a real result?
[2015-05-15 12:39:08] alko, quitting. (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[2015-05-15 12:39:30] jimevans: kyoob: to find out, use the browser's developer tools javascript console and try executing document.querySelectorAll('<your selector here>')
[2015-05-15 12:39:51] jimevans: that, in essence, is what findElements(By.cssSelector('foo')) does.
[2015-05-15 12:40:33] kyoob: sure, but it seems weird that if there are like 150 elements on the page that that would execute faster than if there are 0
[2015-05-15 12:40:51] kyoob: matching elements, that is
[2015-05-15 12:41:16] jimevans: kinda depends on the browser's css selector engine, i'd wager
[2015-05-15 12:41:25] kyoob: i'll give it a try
[2015-05-15 12:41:30] kyoob: For Science!
[2015-05-15 12:44:14] kyoob: nah, from the console it returns in no time even when the elements aren't there to be found
[2015-05-15 12:44:46] jimevans: you're sure you don't have a driver.timeouts().implicitlyWait() in there somewhere?
[2015-05-15 12:44:55] kyoob: jeez now i'm wondering if someone else put an implicit wait in here somewhere
[2015-05-15 12:48:42] kyoob: well well well
[2015-05-15 12:48:48] kyoob: there WERE implicit waits!
[2015-05-15 12:51:05] kyoob: yep. that did it. shaved about 110 seconds off this test.
