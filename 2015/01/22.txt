[2015-01-22 09:40:15] dude-x: a nice trick is return len(d.find_elements(By.X, 'x')) == 1;

[2015-01-22 09:57:09] jimevans: but the january insider update has the first DOM level 3 xpath implementation from MSFT.
[2015-01-22 09:57:49] jleyba: boooo
[2015-01-22 09:59:44] jimevans: if only we'd had a "find any element (not just links) by its text content" method, we could've avoided xpath altogether.
[2015-01-22 10:01:43] jleyba: just add it now?
[2015-01-22 10:02:02] jleyba: also no reason to support xpath just b/c of find-by-link text.  that doesn't have to be a baked into the spec
[2015-01-22 10:02:30] jimevans: jleyba: it's not link text. it's any element by text content.
[2015-01-22 10:02:55] jimevans: there is, like it or not, a compelling use case for finding an element by the equivalent of element.innerText
[2015-01-22 10:03:07] ulmi, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-01-22 10:03:20] jimevans: and xpath is the only way we can achieve that in the current api, or in the spec.
[2015-01-22 10:03:51] jimevans: there is, incidentally, a bug against the spec to do just that. remove xpath, and add a "find by text content"

[2015-01-22 10:05:52] Ankit: Hi All :)
[2015-01-22 10:06:16] Ankit: I am Ankit, a Software Engineer and another user of Selenium Webdriver.
[2015-01-22 10:06:24] jimevans: yes, because the wiki page says to modify the entry from the "32-bit windows apps running on 64-bit windows" section of the registry.
[2015-01-22 10:06:34] dimacus: jimevans: love you
[2015-01-22 10:06:41] Ankit: I am facing an issue with use of selenium, please help.
[2015-01-22 10:06:46] dimacus: jimevans: will you have and raise my children?
[2015-01-22 10:06:55] jimevans: and we do that because even when you're running 64-bit windows, you're not running 64-bit IE.
[2015-01-22 10:06:59] jimevans: :)
[2015-01-22 10:07:13] jimevans: dimacus: i'm too busy raising my own children. :)
[2015-01-22 10:07:31] dimacus: jimevans:  you are not a team player i see :-P
[2015-01-22 10:07:48] Ankit: Whenever I use selenium to navigate a flow on a website, it gives high response time. But when I do it manually, it gives less response time.
[2015-01-22 10:07:51] Ankit: Please help me with this.

[2015-01-22 10:07:59] dimacus: jimevans: ok i'll send a PR for that wiki page to add that point as a PS, i feel it can be more clear
[2015-01-22 10:08:11] jimevans: dimacus: drharmony and i have a general rule: don't let your children outnumber you.
[2015-01-22 10:08:19] jimevans: we're at capacity for that.
[2015-01-22 10:08:20] jimevans: :)
[2015-01-22 10:08:33] dimacus: jimevans: tell that to my wife, i think we are at capacity :-P
[2015-01-22 10:09:01] Ankit: Guys!
[2015-01-22 10:09:03] dimacus: Ankit: what exactly do you mean by high response time? does the page load slower?
[2015-01-22 10:09:12] Ankit: Ya
[2015-01-22 10:09:20] Ankit: The page loads very slowly
[2015-01-22 10:09:37] Ankit: But if I do it manually, then it loads considerably fast.
[2015-01-22 10:09:46] jimevans: dimacus: the whole 32-bit vs 64-bit IE thing is a little more complex than just adding an extra bit to the wiki. see http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2014/09/screenshots-sendkeys-and-sixty-four.html for the full story.
[2015-01-22 10:10:18] Ankit: Selenium is taking almost double the time to load the pages, as compared to manually navigating the flow.
[2015-01-22 10:10:29] jimevans: in particular the section titled "What Happened in IE10"
[2015-01-22 10:10:45] Ankit: The issue is coming with Chrome, not IE.
[2015-01-22 10:10:58] dimacus: jimevans: yeah i'm trying to stay away from 64bit per your request
[2015-01-22 10:10:59] jimevans: Ankit: i'm having a separate conversation with dimacus.
[2015-01-22 10:11:00] Ankit: 32-bit driver of chrome.
[2015-01-22 10:11:11] dimacus: Ankit: do you have some firewalls on your system or any proxies?
[2015-01-22 10:11:16] dimacus: that might slow down the page load
[2015-01-22 10:11:19] Ankit: No
[2015-01-22 10:11:42] Ankit: If they restrict, then they should restrict during manual flow also, right?
[2015-01-22 10:12:01] dimacus: depends
[2015-01-22 10:12:26] Ankit: Can you please explain?
[2015-01-22 10:12:27] dimacus: Ankit: how big of a time difference are we talking about per page load?
[2015-01-22 10:12:37] dimacus: 2x 10x or 10ms slower?
[2015-01-22 10:13:00] Ankit: Umm, manually the page takes approx 2.24secs. to load but with selenium webdriver it is taking 4 or more for the same page.
[2015-01-22 10:13:04] Ankit: 2x
[2015-01-22 10:13:14] Hestil, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-01-22 10:13:20] dimacus: well… 4 second page load is not too bad
[2015-01-22 10:13:35] Ankit: But it doesn't match the client requirements.
[2015-01-22 10:13:56] dimacus: ok here is the other question, when you say Page loads
[2015-01-22 10:14:05] dimacus: do you mean that things are on the page become visible?
[2015-01-22 10:14:23] dimacus: or do you mean that every single item on the page loaded and the browser says "document.read == true"
[2015-01-22 10:14:30] dimacus: because those are 2 different things
[2015-01-22 10:14:38] Ankit: When the circle on top-left of browser stops rotating. And the time when selenium makes its new click.
[2015-01-22 10:14:39] dimacus: and selenium waits for the 2nd condition
[2015-01-22 10:15:01] Ankit: No no, complete load of the page, I mean.
[2015-01-22 10:15:31] dimacus: Ankit: your problem might be, is that the test is waiting for the JavaScript to be ready to execute, which might take some time after the spinner stops spinning
[2015-01-22 10:15:59] dimacus: as a human the page looks normal and you are ready to use and click it, but in background it's not "fully loaded" and Selenium waits for the "fully loaded" state
[2015-01-22 10:16:06] admc, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-01-22 10:16:39] jimevans: yep. that's particularly true for things like third-party analytics scripts too.
[2015-01-22 10:16:53] dimacus: Ankit: if you want to garantee faster page loads
[2015-01-22 10:17:09] dimacus: you want to block all 3rd party tracking sites, tracking pixels, assets etc
[2015-01-22 10:17:23] dimacus: think facebook like button etc… those will make the tests run much slower
[2015-01-22 10:17:24] Ankit: No third party app is loading.
[2015-01-22 10:17:37] Ankit: The whole environment is provided by client only.
[2015-01-22 10:17:52] dimacus: are you sure? try your page with "YSlow" you would be surprized how many CDNs your page loads from
[2015-01-22 10:18:01] Ankit: Dimacus, Ohk, your point seems good, but what should I do to resolve such things.
[2015-01-22 10:18:11] dimacus: one sec i had a blog post about it

[2015-01-22 10:18:32] dimacus: Ankit: https://engineering.groupon.com/2013/misc/black-hole-proxy-for-selenium-testing/
[2015-01-22 10:18:37] Ankit: Ohk, I will try Yslow. Actually, our client has a tool to get the timings of page load for all calls.
[2015-01-22 10:18:56] dimacus: basically block anything that does not come from your test box, especially facebook, twitter, etc
[2015-01-22 10:19:02] Ankit: He has shown me the time it takes manually and through selenium.
[2015-01-22 10:19:05] dimacus: that blog post is overkill
[2015-01-22 10:19:08] dimacus: but the idea is there
[2015-01-22 10:20:13] Ankit: Is it like, if I have made lots of objects and made the Java code very object oriented, then it is taking time in calling functions and loading files.......
[2015-01-22 10:20:24] Ankit: Use of static functions.....
[2015-01-22 10:20:27] Ankit: Anything like that?
[2015-01-22 10:21:45] dimacus: i don't think so
[2015-01-22 10:22:27] dimacus: Ankit: one sec i'll give you an example
[2015-01-22 10:23:16] Ankit: Sure, please.
[2015-01-22 10:25:17] Hestil, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-22 10:25:43] Ankit: Apart from removing proxy, is there any way I can handle this issue?
[2015-01-22 10:25:54] dimacus: Ankit: ok so if you load google.com, it is a simple empty page
[2015-01-22 10:25:58] dimacus: but look
[2015-01-22 10:26:57] dimacus: Ankit: http://i.imgur.com/pCzPNoT.png
[2015-01-22 10:27:39] dimacus: there are several 3rd party links on google.com that load after the page "loaded", so webdriver ends up waiting for all of the 3rd party things in the background to load, before it clicks
[2015-01-22 10:28:02] dimacus: the problem is that those things are in background and are not needed… they are there unrelated to the actual site
[2015-01-22 10:28:36] adamgoucher: run your script through a proxy like the browsermob one and send the 3rd party crap into a blackhole
[2015-01-22 10:29:20] dimacus: actually i had luck on firefox without having a proxy all together
[2015-01-22 10:29:26] Ankit: Ya, right dimacus. This I understood. My client has some tools which check the load time of all calls. The calls seem genuine for both the flow (manual and selenium). The only difference which is occuring is that manual flow is taking less response time in bringing the page and its resources than selenium.

[2015-01-22 10:33:06] jleyba: Ankit: you can get performance info from chromedriver, see what is taking longer

[2015-01-22 10:33:37] dimacus: Ankit: actually you could run in a headless browser if 2 second difference matters
[2015-01-22 10:33:57] Ankit: How can I run in headless browser?
[2015-01-22 10:34:01] Ankit: How to do that?
[2015-01-22 10:34:53] dimacus: Ankit: there are about a dozen soultions, depending if you are running on linux, windows, browser, etc
[2015-01-22 10:35:18] dimacus: Ankit: for example, here is how to do it on linux and firefox http://elementalselenium.com/tips/38-headless

[2015-01-22 10:39:39] Ankit: Lol :P
[2015-01-22 10:40:15] Ankit: Demacus, you were saying something about running in headless browser. What is it like, what difference it can make?
[2015-01-22 10:40:37] jleyba: saves you performance on rendering time. makes no difference in network performance
[2015-01-22 10:40:45] dimacus: i've seen a 30% performance boost with ruby and firefox
[2015-01-22 10:41:04] dimacus: but it's not a real web browser
[2015-01-22 10:41:11] dimacus: so take it with a grain of salt
[2015-01-22 10:41:31] jleyba: phantomjs is qtwebkit, which is a real rendering engine
[2015-01-22 10:42:06] jleyba: uses the craptastic JavaScriptCore for js though
[2015-01-22 10:42:11] dimacus: jleyba: did qtwebkit switch to an actual JS engine or are they running their own implementation?
[2015-01-22 10:42:37] jleyba: supposedly they're working on switching to v8. not sure what the progress is
[2015-01-22 10:43:25] dimacus: Ankit: so you can use qtwebkit, but it's a web browser simulation… so that's your trade off
[2015-01-22 10:44:14] dimacus: Ankit: just out of curiosity though, what kind of a client requires a page load of 2.4 seconds instead of 4 seconds in a selenium test? should you be using Selenium at all in this situation?
[2015-01-22 10:44:33] SwampDragons, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-22 10:45:00] Ankit: He just wants to automate the flow without affecting load time of page.
[2015-01-22 10:45:06] Ankit: Manually, it is 2.24 only.
[2015-01-22 10:45:19] dimacus: again… this might not be the right tool for the job
[2015-01-22 10:45:28] dimacus: selenium is good for automating test flows
[2015-01-22 10:45:34] dimacus: it's not a performance tool
[2015-01-22 10:45:57] dimacus: there is an implied sacrifice in speed of the test run when testing with selenium
[2015-01-22 10:46:14] dimacus: the trade up for slower tests, is that you run your tests in a real browser like a real user would
[2015-01-22 10:47:44] Ankit: Ohk, just want to give every shot which can make selenium equally fast as manual page loads......
[2015-01-22 10:48:06] Ankit: Will check proxy first, then what should be my next step?
[2015-01-22 10:48:08] dimacus: Ankit: you could disable implicit waits for page loads :-P
[2015-01-22 10:48:12] dimacus: but that's playing with fire
[2015-01-22 10:48:34] Ankit: Haha, no implicit waits are there. I am using thread.sleep
[2015-01-22 10:48:45] *dimacus throws up a little'

[2015-01-22 10:53:18] Ankit: What difference these calls make?
[2015-01-22 10:53:37] dimacus: Ankit: to be honest this is a bit of a philosophical debate here, personally i would rather add 2 mins of time to a single test run if that will guarantee 0 flakiness, but good luck with boosting load times, that's a tricky snake to catch. If you figure it out how to do it effectively, make a blog post and send me your resume ;_
[2015-01-22 10:53:45] Ankit: Sleep/implicitwait/explicitwait..... all are stopping to click for some time.
[2015-01-22 10:54:11] jleyba: Ankit: sleep does nothing to solve the race condition
[2015-01-22 10:54:53] Ankit: Haha :D
[2015-01-22 10:56:06] Ankit: What should I check after I check proxy of my browser and all?
[2015-01-22 10:56:24] Ankit: After I remove proxy, then what else I can do to resolve the issue?
[2015-01-22 10:56:34] dimacus: Ankit: go with explicit waits before you do proxy
[2015-01-22 10:56:49] dimacus: proxy is your last resort
[2015-01-22 10:56:51] Ankit: Ohk
[2015-01-22 10:57:24] dimacus: yeah, instead of doing thread.sleep, you will wait for the button that you want to click on to show up and click, even if the page is not 100% loaded
[2015-01-22 10:57:33] jleyba: enable performance logging and see what chrome reports as taking a long time to load
[2015-01-22 11:00:27] Ankit: Ohk, if chrome report show some weird data, then how should I proceed?
[2015-01-22 11:00:38] Ankit: I mea, after implementing explicitwaits.

[2015-01-22 14:02:42] AutomatedTester: and by shopping I mean on a cruise ship
[2015-01-22 14:03:18] jleyba: I'd love to see MSFT tell their enterprise users to suck it up and just prepare for the old thing going away
[2015-01-22 14:03:24] jimevans: AutomatedTester: 16 days.
[2015-01-22 14:03:29] jleyba: Not necessarily with this IE/sparan thing, but with something
[2015-01-22 14:03:38] jleyba: just once with something
[2015-01-22 14:03:49] AutomatedTester: jleyba: they are going to have to
[2015-01-22 14:04:31] jimevans: jleyba: but that would absolutely kill the revenue stream. no business would willingly buy windows 10 if that were the story.
[2015-01-22 14:04:45] jimevans: and they'd remain on 7, like they are today.
[2015-01-22 14:05:21] jleyba: jimevans: MS is just creating more and more technical debt for themselves by continuing to support redundant products
[2015-01-22 14:05:27] jimevans: agreed.

[2015-01-22 14:06:45] jleyba: they only look 6 months in the future
[2015-01-22 14:07:22] jimevans: i have to say, watching the briefing yesterday, most of what they were talking about was saying the right things.
[2015-01-22 14:07:46] jimevans: free upgrade for any windows 7 or greater user to windows 10.
[2015-01-22 14:07:57] AutomatedTester: they have to do that tbqh
[2015-01-22 14:07:58] jleyba: Yeah, Apple forced their hand on that one
[2015-01-22 14:07:59] jimevans: forced streaming updates
[2015-01-22 14:08:09] AutomatedTester: they are the last OS that requires payment
[2015-01-22 14:08:32] jimevans: i can take or leave the cortana integration
[2015-01-22 14:08:52] jimevans: but the cross-form-factor binary story is kinda compelling.
[2015-01-22 14:09:21] jimevans: that was probably the biggest technical takeaway from yesterday.
[2015-01-22 14:09:21] jleyba: Curious to see how that works out in the long run
[2015-01-22 14:09:40] jimevans: it'll be an interesting experiment, to be sure.
[2015-01-22 14:09:55] jleyba: That will certainly help with getting apps onto Windows Phone
[2015-01-22 14:10:35] jimevans: the vaporware from yesterday was kinda fun to think about
[2015-01-22 14:11:48] jimevans: and by vaporware i mean the hololens bits. even though i cringed every time they improperly used "hologram".
[2015-01-22 14:12:25] jleyba: I doubt it will be vaporware
[2015-01-22 14:12:38] jleyba: it will be a niche product, but will probably launch
[2015-01-22 14:12:42] jimevans: no, i'm sure it does and will exist in the market.
[2015-01-22 14:14:01] jimevans: and the potential applications for the kind of augmented reality one could build are fun to contemplate.
[2015-01-22 14:14:23] jimevans: but this won't be "the one" that gets us all wearing headsets and waving in the air for everyday computing.

[2015-01-22 14:30:06] ato: AutomatedTester: Okay, then why do we need “focus window on switching to it” to be built in to Marionette?
[2015-01-22 14:36:34] AutomatedTester: ato: are you talking about whimboo's bug/
[2015-01-22 14:37:11] ato: Yes, I was going to retort with “why don't we make it focus all windows like WebDriver does”, which seems to be true for 2/4 implementations I've checked so far.
[2015-01-22 14:37:33] ato: But essentially my argument is that I think the focus argument should be removed altogether.
[2015-01-22 14:37:40] AutomatedTester: because there is probably something Firefox specific
[2015-01-22 14:37:51] ato: Because you can achieve the same thing with executeScript("window.focus()").
[2015-01-22 14:38:31] AutomatedTester: ato: there is contention within Mozilla about the part of the html5 spec that talks about focus
[2015-01-22 14:38:55] AutomatedTester: since what does  "focus" mean
[2015-01-22 14:39:03] ato: Status quo is that you can do that; that's even the workaround that's being used in production code.
[2015-01-22 14:39:26] ato: And it's what Marionette would have to do internally.
[2015-01-22 14:40:06] ato: My point is that it's a bad idea to deviate from the WebDriver API when we don't have to.
[2015-01-22 14:40:43] ato: There are also a number of other bugs I could've argued this point on, but I only have a finite amount of energy.
[2015-01-22 14:41:08] jleyba: ato: Firefox has to focus the window b/c it won't process input events if it is not the active application
[2015-01-22 14:41:29] jleyba: That's why we have the nofocuslib for linux - to block blur events so Firefox will actually fire events WebDriver tells it to
[2015-01-22 14:41:33] ato: jleyba: We're not really talking abot focus anymore.

[2015-01-22 14:41:58] ato: Marionette accepts an argument to switchToWindow which tells it to focus the window.
[2015-01-22 14:43:08] ato: Sorry, switchToFrame does.
[2015-01-22 14:48:21] AutomatedTester: ato: so technically we aren't deviating from the spec as such. This looks like more b2g 'fun'
[2015-01-22 14:50:08] AutomatedTester: ato: looking at the code I need to understand why they want to not focus
[2015-01-22 14:50:24] AutomatedTester: since the default is to implicitly focus
[2015-01-22 14:52:15] AutomatedTester: ato: it appears that keyboard in FirefoxOS is a special snowflake

[2015-01-22 15:12:50] ato: If the default is to focus, we should probably fix that then.
[2015-01-22 15:13:15] ato: What they want feels like something that should be built on top of Marionette; not in it.
