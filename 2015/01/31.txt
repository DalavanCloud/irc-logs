[2015-01-31 18:12:45] pikaren: timg: Thanks. I'm a beginner to Selenium. I'll look up how I can select the 'like button' element
[2015-01-31 18:15:30] pikaren: It seems that I have to learn how make a XPath query
[2015-01-31 18:18:45] timg: usually you don't need to resort to xpath
[2015-01-31 18:19:59] pikaren: timg: Could I pick a big elements first and then locate some child element inside it?
[2015-01-31 18:21:09] timg: I'm sure you could
[2015-01-31 18:22:47] timg: It looks like all of the thumbs up buttons have the same class, so you might be able to select by class name
[2015-01-31 18:23:35] timg: I'm not sure though, they're using some pretty strange class names so they might be doing some kind of obfuscation to make it harder to automate
[2015-01-31 18:23:44] timg: I've never done anything on youtube

[2015-01-31 22:05:35] highbass: hey guys i am using selenium in pythong...
[2015-01-31 22:05:59] highbass: i was wondering is it possible to get the html sources of an element you find
[2015-01-31 22:06:20] highbass: for example if i find find_element_by_xpath
[2015-01-31 22:06:23] highbass: on my page
[2015-01-31 22:06:30] highbass: and it stops at
[2015-01-31 22:06:44] highbass: <table id=blah> </table>
[2015-01-31 22:06:54] highbass: is it possible i can pull everthing within that id ... so under that table?
[2015-01-31 22:07:03] highbass: i know i can do page_source
[2015-01-31 22:07:33] highbass: that gives me the full page source but i rather just get that specific element or div or whichever element i find
