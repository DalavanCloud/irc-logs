[2015-01-17 13:50:59] AutomatedTester: jarib: I will try look at it on Monday
[2015-01-17 13:51:10] jarib: great
[2015-01-17 13:51:31] jarib: the warning says "use WebIDL bindings or Components.utils.cloneInto instead". not sure what is meant by WebIDL bindings in this context, but may be worth looking into
[2015-01-17 13:51:48] AutomatedTester: cloneInto doesnt work?
[2015-01-17 13:52:07] AutomatedTester: I should really read the bug :)
[2015-01-17 13:52:25] jarib: cloneInto works, that's the marionette approach, where we lose the ability to call functions
[2015-01-17 13:52:39] jarib: also, we only use a sandbox if doc.designMode is on
[2015-01-17 13:53:00] AutomatedTester: can't we always use a sandbox?
[2015-01-17 13:53:53] jarib: not without losing the ability to call functions
[2015-01-17 13:54:14] AutomatedTester: I wonder if it's a wrapping issue...
[2015-01-17 13:54:28] jarib: also, we don't have a sandbox version of execute async script
[2015-01-17 13:54:40] jarib: we just throw if someone tries to execute async with designMode on
[2015-01-17 13:55:03] jarib: marionette seems to implement async execution with the sandbox, though

[2015-01-17 19:21:12] Derp_: So I was using the normal Firefox driver for a little while.  But before I installed/began using it, I hardly used firefox. Now that I've used it a little, it automatically updated to the newest version, which is 35 and the driver doesn't appear to support it. Yet I can't find which version of firefox I should update to, to make the latest driver work for it again, since the driver doesn't seem to have any note saying what it supports
[2015-01-17 19:21:41] Derp_: I guess my question is what firefox version is the latest selenium supporting?
[2015-01-17 19:22:14] Derp_: Unless something else is wrong. When ran, it gives a unknown driver version error.
[2015-01-17 19:25:25] Derp_: Specifically: "f.QueryInterface is not a function".
[2015-01-17 19:26:16] Derp_: ...Nevermind. I derped.
[2015-01-17 19:26:43] Derp_: Didn't have the proper protocol in the url.
