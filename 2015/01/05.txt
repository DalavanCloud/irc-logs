[2015-01-05 09:27:17] jimevans: nmatrix9: i'd be surprised if you found *any* tutorials featuring selenium ide.
[2015-01-05 09:27:57] nmatrix9: This is primarily for training for BA's on my team.
[2015-01-05 09:28:03] nmatrix9: jimevans, Why is that?
[2015-01-05 09:29:19] WhereIsMySpoon: nmatrix9: because its old and fairly self explanatory anyway
[2015-01-05 09:29:40] jimevans: nmatrix9: i can't talk rationally about selenium ide. i'm on record as believing record-playback is doomed to failure as a long-term automation strategy
[2015-01-05 09:29:40] WhereIsMySpoon: nmatrix9: in any case, you'd use IDE the same way on any website
[2015-01-05 09:29:40] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-05 09:29:43] *WhereIsMySpoon agrees with jimevans'
[2015-01-05 09:29:59] jleyba: +1
[2015-01-05 09:30:10] nmatrix9: jimevans, Ok
[2015-01-05 09:30:56] jleyba: nmatrix9 unfortunately, most of participants in this channel are not fans of Selenium IDE

[2015-01-05 09:31:03] nmatrix9: jimevans, What about just for quick prototype testing?
[2015-01-05 09:31:12] joshin4colours: hello
[2015-01-05 09:31:34] jimevans: for quick prototyping, it can be useful. but any scripts generated therefrom will grow stale very very quickly.
[2015-01-05 09:31:36] joshin4colours: I would like to help out with Marionette :) which IRC channel should I join?

[2015-01-05 09:31:51] ato: joshin4colours: ↑ AutomatedTester
[2015-01-05 09:32:24] nmatrix9: jimevans, I agree with you for long term testing strategy it would be a disaster, but for quick prototype testing by BA's that is what Iam aiming for
[2015-01-05 09:32:44] WhereIsMySpoon: nmatrix9: fire it up and have a play about
[2015-01-05 09:32:58] WhereIsMySpoon: im not really sure you want to be advocating it as a solution to a group of people though
[2015-01-05 09:33:05] WhereIsMySpoon: you're better off starting with webdriver from the beginning
[2015-01-05 09:33:06] jimevans: nmatrix9: bear in mind though, selenium ide is barely maintained, so you'll likely have challenges making it work with modern websites.
[2015-01-05 09:33:16] WhereIsMySpoon: short term scripts inevitably become longer term
[2015-01-05 09:33:48] jleyba: nmatrix9: "BA"?
[2015-01-05 09:34:05] joshin4colours: ato: thanks!
[2015-01-05 09:34:11] nmatrix9: jleyba, Business Analysts
[2015-01-05 09:34:11] jimevans: a behavior-driven development option might be a better approach if you insist that your business analysts *have* to write test cases.
[2015-01-05 09:34:20] WhereIsMySpoon: "business analyst"?
[2015-01-05 09:34:24] WhereIsMySpoon: what the heck does that have to do with autoamtino
[2015-01-05 09:34:26] WhereIsMySpoon: automation*
[2015-01-05 09:34:36] WhereIsMySpoon: nmatrix9: I hope these people are properly trained coders
[2015-01-05 09:34:48] jimevans: it's the old "how do i get non-coders to be able to write automated tests"
[2015-01-05 09:34:48] ato: joshin4colours: #ateam on irc.mozilla.org is the short answer, but I'm a bit busy now to help.
[2015-01-05 09:35:00] WhereIsMySpoon: short answer, you get them to learn to code
[2015-01-05 09:35:00] nmatrix9: WhereIsMySpoon, they have some experience in coding but not a lot.
[2015-01-05 09:35:03] joshin4colours: ato: that's exactly what I'm looking for
[2015-01-05 09:35:05] joshin4colours: thanks again!
[2015-01-05 09:35:18] jimevans: which can't be done, imo, or is doomed to failure if you try, but that doesn't seem to stop people from trying.
[2015-01-05 09:35:29] jleyba: nmatrix9: Use WebDriver with python
[2015-01-05 09:35:38] ato: joshin4colours: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Marionette
[2015-01-05 09:35:40] WhereIsMySpoon: nmatrix9: ok, well coding in selenium is a little less involved than a lot of production type code, but still requires a lot of coding skills
[2015-01-05 09:35:45] nmatrix9: jimevans, behaviour-driven development,  I don't think I've heard of that before
[2015-01-05 09:35:51] jleyba: The python API is straight forward and you can quickly prototype with it
[2015-01-05 09:35:57] jimevans: nmatrix9: look at the cucumber project.
[2015-01-05 09:36:03] jimevans: that'll give you an idea.

[2015-01-05 09:38:16] WhereIsMySpoon: nmatrix9: that's a completely pointless vote to have a whole presentation about
[2015-01-05 09:38:21] WhereIsMySpoon: its just a set of language bindings

[2015-01-05 09:39:01] jleyba: WhereIsMySpoon: disagree there
[2015-01-05 09:39:10] WhereIsMySpoon: what language you choose depends on what skills your analysts have

[2015-01-05 09:39:37] nmatrix9: WhereIsMySpoon, when going through the documentation
[2015-01-05 09:39:37] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: what supporting libraries and frameworks are available are also considerations.
[2015-01-05 09:39:48] WhereIsMySpoon: hm I guess
[2015-01-05 09:39:53] jleyba: nmatrix9: We try to keep the language bindings consistent, yet idiomatic for each language
[2015-01-05 09:39:53] jimevans: nmatrix9: please enlighten me where you find (other than slight cosmetic) differences.
[2015-01-05 09:39:58] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-05 09:40:05] WhereIsMySpoon: i know nothing about .net but JUnit works fine for java
[2015-01-05 09:40:35] WhereIsMySpoon: im sure .net has a similar thing
[2015-01-05 09:40:44] jimevans: NUnit is what you're looking for, WhereIsMySpoon
[2015-01-05 09:40:51] WhereIsMySpoon: there you go
[2015-01-05 09:41:11] WhereIsMySpoon: the bindings you use is a question that needs to be answered ofc
[2015-01-05 09:41:30] WhereIsMySpoon: but i dont think its worth what you seem to be putting into it
[2015-01-05 09:42:09] WhereIsMySpoon: and from what you've said it looks like the skills your people have and what you're working with are higher priority
[2015-01-05 09:43:37] nmatrix9: WhereIsMySpoon, Well I am trying to learn as much as I can,  especially best practices.  Having the BA's get a license for Visual Studio and TFS and start hammering away some test unit classes does not seem likely atm.

[2015-01-05 09:44:16] WhereIsMySpoon: im a coder by practice and I just downloaded the selenium jar, opened up a new project in eclipse and got cracking
[2015-01-05 09:44:26] jleyba: ew eclipse
[2015-01-05 09:44:29] WhereIsMySpoon: some time later and I have a whole test suite
[2015-01-05 09:44:32] WhereIsMySpoon: oh shut it

[2015-01-05 09:46:01] nmatrix9: WhereIsMySpoon, but like I said we are a microsoft shop mostly so we are heavily into the microsoft stack.
[2015-01-05 09:46:16] adamgoucher: application stack != automation stack
[2015-01-05 09:46:19] WhereIsMySpoon: why, are they paying you to use VS?
[2015-01-05 09:46:27] WhereIsMySpoon: also what adam said
[2015-01-05 09:47:05] WhereIsMySpoon: use whatever makes your work flow better
[2015-01-05 09:47:06] jimevans: hey, visual studio isn't bad kit.
[2015-01-05 09:47:06] WhereIsMySpoon: get that guy to download the selenium jar, open up a new project, stick it in there and start hacking
[2015-01-05 09:47:06] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: never said it was
[2015-01-05 09:47:10] WhereIsMySpoon: ive used it myself
[2015-01-05 09:47:11] jimevans: (says the biggest microsoft apologist in the channel)
[2015-01-05 09:47:43] jleyba: I've long held VS is one of MS's best products
[2015-01-05 09:47:55] WhereIsMySpoon: the java bindings for selenium are quite well done and are very easy to use
[2015-01-05 09:48:15] WhereIsMySpoon: (i use them)
[2015-01-05 09:48:27] jimevans: jleyba: made even moreso by the release of the community edition. you can even build the IE driver in c++ with it.
[2015-01-05 09:48:51] jleyba: is that the bombshell they dropped last month?
[2015-01-05 09:48:56] jimevans: ayep.
[2015-01-05 09:49:36] jimevans: visual studio community edition includes *almost* everything professional does, including the ATL templates.
[2015-01-05 09:49:41] nmatrix9: Is there a .net WebDriver for Safari?
[2015-01-05 09:49:51] jleyba: yes and no
[2015-01-05 09:50:04] nmatrix9: ?
[2015-01-05 09:50:14] WhereIsMySpoon: yes but its discontinued and out of date
[2015-01-05 09:50:35] WhereIsMySpoon: afaik
[2015-01-05 09:50:36] jleyba: It's not discontinued
[2015-01-05 09:50:36] WhereIsMySpoon: ok then ignore me
[2015-01-05 09:50:57] WhereIsMySpoon: sorry :D
[2015-01-05 09:50:58] jimevans: there's a SafariDriver class in the .NET bindings, but since Safari is no longer supported on Windows, it's kind of a moot point.
[2015-01-05 09:51:04] jleyba: ^ very important
[2015-01-05 09:51:13] jleyba: last Safari for Windows was 5.1.7, which is ancient
[2015-01-05 09:51:16] WhereIsMySpoon: but what about all those people using .net on mac
[2015-01-05 09:51:25] jimevans: jleyba: the other big bombshell is the open-sourcing of the .NET framework, and a commitment to a cross-platform library.
[2015-01-05 09:51:26] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2015-01-05 09:51:32] nmatrix9: I am using Safari on Windows right now I believe
[2015-01-05 09:51:41] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2015-01-05 09:51:53] WhereIsMySpoon: anyway im off
[2015-01-05 09:51:53] WhereIsMySpoon: o/
[2015-01-05 09:52:05] nmatrix9: Double checking just to make sure Iam not hallucinating
[2015-01-05 09:52:39] jleyba: nmatrix9: Safari has very very few hooks for automation, so the WebDriver implementation has lots of limitations
[2015-01-05 09:52:43] jimevans: nmatrix9: there is a version of safari for windows. it's 5.1.7. it also hasn't been updated in about 2 years from apple
[2015-01-05 09:52:46] fabrice31, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-05 09:52:58] jimevans: the latest version of safari on OS X is 8.0.2
[2015-01-05 09:53:10] nmatrix9: jimevans, yes I am using 5.1.7

[2015-01-05 09:54:59] nmatrix9: good point
[2015-01-05 09:55:50] nmatrix9: jleyba, But I work in a company where we fight people still on IE 8

[2015-01-05 09:58:01] jimevans: rumor.
[2015-01-05 09:58:05] nmatrix9: Yeah code name Spartan
[2015-01-05 09:59:12] jimevans: even if they rename it, it'll most likely be new paint on an old fence.
[2015-01-05 09:59:20] jimevans: though that's exaggerating a bit.
[2015-01-05 09:59:36] jimevans: because they'll actually be able to kill off some legacy code.
