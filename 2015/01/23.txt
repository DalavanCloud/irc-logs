[2015-01-23 03:53:42] shteou_: mers: I suppose the selector methods are entirely analagous to their JS counterparts (document.getElementById/getElementsBy*/querySelectorAll). When you get a reference to an element (with vanilla selenium) it should be robust to html changes (e.g. you can move the element about within the DOM), but if the element is deleted (even if it is replaced with an identical element) or detached from the DOM you will get a stale reference exception

[2015-01-23 03:54:50] BW^-: so I installed the extension
[2015-01-23 03:55:09] BW^-: the webdriver.xpi file
[2015-01-23 03:55:17] BW^-: I did this last year and vaguely remember how it's done
[2015-01-23 03:57:04] shteou: Hmm BW^-,how do you mean start listening on HTTP? Wouldn't you boot up Firefox directly from your webdriver bindings or via selenium-server? Either way that extension should be installed for you into the launched profile
[2015-01-23 03:57:05] neeti, quitting. (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[2015-01-23 03:58:22] mers: shteou: and it's only one particular selector which is used, correct? from what i've seen in Selenium IDE, there can be different ways to select the same element (screenshot here http://imgur.com/Kuajfaj ). i'd like to confirm that there isn't some way to combine those different mechanisms (ID, CSS, DOM, XPath) to heuristically select an element and make tests less brittle
[2015-01-23 04:00:38] Hestil, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-23 04:01:33] shteou: Yeah I think that's correct, mers. I think that test brittleness comes from your own combination of selectors. With the exception of maybe xpath on some very old browsers
[2015-01-23 04:01:44] shteou: Where some browsers support different xpath specs / may have bugs
[2015-01-23 04:02:40] Dave_B_1: there are some wrappers that try the different mechanisms to ook up elements, resulting in much harder debugging and less deterministic tests
[2015-01-23 04:03:09] mers: Dave_B_1: so you think it backfires?
[2015-01-23 04:03:14] Dave_B_1: absolutely
[2015-01-23 04:03:47] shteou: Yeah, would definitely agree. There may be one or two cases where it has its merits but by and large I'd stick to defining your own selectors and following a few simple rules
[2015-01-23 04:03:57] StaphY, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-01-23 04:04:00] Dave_B_1: they can cause all sorts of weird problems where you can match unintended elements and working out what went werong is a total pain
[2015-01-23 04:04:14] StaphY, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-23 04:04:47] shteou: Like selecting by ID where possible (directly on the webdriver object rather than a child element) and trying to analyse your css selectors to avoid known problem areas and use as few elements as possible for selection
[2015-01-23 04:04:57] BW^-: shteou: no I do not boot it up via the Java webdriver bindings or selenium-server
[2015-01-23 04:04:59] mers: interesting. know of any by name? would be curious to see how they work
[2015-01-23 04:05:04] Hestil, quitting. (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[2015-01-23 04:05:08] mers: the wrappers i mean
[2015-01-23 04:05:12] Dave_B_1: there are ways of making selectors less brittle (e.g. don't use xpath, don't use full paths to elements, make sure you're using waits appropriately for stuff that's loaded in late/changes)
[2015-01-23 04:05:17] BW^-: shteou: so, I have installed the Webdriver extension into Firefox.
[2015-01-23 04:05:22] BW^-: shteou: now I want to make it start listening on port 7055.
[2015-01-23 04:05:36] BW^-: shteou: I vaguely remember that some command line argument is needed to Firefox, for it to start doing that.
[2015-01-23 04:06:43] shteou: Ah okay, 1 sec BW^- let me see if I can find it
[2015-01-23 04:07:44] Dave_B_1: mers: Just trying to find an example now, I've forgotten what the ones I've run into previously were called!
[2015-01-23 04:07:57] mers: Dave_B_1: cheers
[2015-01-23 04:10:22] Dave_B_1: d'oh, the first one I thought I found actually just converts everything to xpath, for the worst of all worlds! :(
[2015-01-23 04:10:29] mers: lol
[2015-01-23 04:11:26] mers: on an orthogonal note, know of any JS libraries that let me easily capture the different types of element selectors by hovering over an element? like the Selenium IDE extension, but embedded using JS?

[2015-01-23 04:16:04] BW^-: shteou: I found it in the past, it's somewhere in the Java code I believe
[2015-01-23 04:16:38] shteou: Yeah, it should be littered over all the driver bindings I guess, BW^-
[2015-01-23 04:16:44] shteou: Just having a quick search through
[2015-01-23 04:17:02] BW^-: shteou: yeah i saw it in the past.. i found it.. now just remember time
[2015-01-23 04:19:00] Dave_B_1: mers: Not a great example, but you can see e.g https://github.com/bbangert/lettuce_webdriver/blob/master/lettuce_webdriver/util.py#L170 where find_button and the called find_field_with_value are both going for 'anything that slightly matches is good enough'
[2015-01-23 04:19:48] Dave_B_1: just ignore the minor detail that the find by id actually does xpath :p
[2015-01-23 04:19:50] shteou: BW^-: It looks like perhaps it's just set in the profile as 'port', but I'm just checking
[2015-01-23 04:19:50] BW^-: shteou: do you see it?
[2015-01-23 04:19:51] Dave_B_1: and so on
[2015-01-23 04:20:25] Dave_B_1: mers: As you can see it doesn't make everything nice and obvious :( I'd really not go down that route
[2015-01-23 04:22:32] shteou: Aha BW^-, 1 mo will paste some relevant bits
[2015-01-23 04:23:40] BW^-: stheou: super
[2015-01-23 04:24:49] shteou: BW^-: http://www.privatepaste.com/b4c7742cd9
[2015-01-23 04:25:16] mers: Dave_B_1: right. that kind of blanket cascade through "anything that slightly matches" looks like it would cause more problems. i was thinking more along the lines of capturing plenty of information about an element, using only the strongest match, and then if those matches break, having an automated way to help fix tests. e.g. "element with ID X no longer exists. element with ID Y matches what we captured about element with ID X. update test
[2015-01-23 04:25:16] mers: references from Y to X?"
[2015-01-23 04:25:18] shteou: I was just looking at the ruby driver implementation there, perhaps there are other ways to do it
[2015-01-23 04:25:31] shteou: (since that is what I have on disk)
[2015-01-23 04:25:40] mers: Dave_B_1: it's lofty, i know :)
[2015-01-23 04:26:14] Dave_B_1: ahh, I see what you mean mers. Not seen that, sorry!
[2015-01-23 04:26:25] Dave_B_1: soundsâ€¦ complicated :p
[2015-01-23 04:26:26] BW^-: shteou: you may be right - i'll try it
[2015-01-23 04:26:27] WhereIsMySpoon: mers: that would require you to keep a data list of all of the possible ways of identifying elements over each test run
[2015-01-23 04:26:54] WhereIsMySpoon: and there is so much stuff in html templates nowadays that many elements can be very simila
[2015-01-23 04:26:55] WhereIsMySpoon: r
[2015-01-23 04:27:04] WhereIsMySpoon: so i dont really see that working
[2015-01-23 04:27:20] BW^-: shteou: okay interesting, so it already made a "ebdriver.log.browser.file", "driver.file" and "init" configuration setting in about:config
[2015-01-23 04:27:23] BW^-: yeah so let's add that and see.
[2015-01-23 04:28:09] Dave_B_1: I'd agree WhereIsMySpoon. Also, if an element isn't there that I'm expecting I'm totally happy for my test to fail
[2015-01-23 04:28:16] mers: WhereIsMySpoon: not only similar, but dynamic. it's a thought exercise at this point. trying to learn about what's out there
[2015-01-23 04:28:16] WhereIsMySpoon: ^^^^ this
[2015-01-23 04:28:21] WhereIsMySpoon: what Dave_B_1 said i mean
[2015-01-23 04:28:29] WhereIsMySpoon: mers: its important to allow tests to fail
[2015-01-23 04:29:17] BW^-: shteou: now can that be set from the command line?..
[2015-01-23 04:29:35] BW^-: can I set a configuration property from the command line?
[2015-01-23 04:29:47] shteou: BW^-: Maybe, I'll see if I can find it in the mozilla source :P
[2015-01-23 04:29:50] WhereIsMySpoon: BW^-: you mean when you start up the server node/hub?
[2015-01-23 04:29:55] WhereIsMySpoon: or are you talking about f
[2015-01-23 04:29:56] WhereIsMySpoon: ff*
[2015-01-23 04:30:26] shteou: mers: We did similar things at my old job, we kept a database of selectors, but it was very rudimentary
[2015-01-23 04:30:42] shteou: I eventually gave up on it thinking re-running the tests was actually quicker
[2015-01-23 04:31:01] WhereIsMySpoon: well it also kinda goes against what you're trying to do
[2015-01-23 04:31:05] BW^-: WhereIsMySpoon: when I start firefox, yes
[2015-01-23 04:31:21] WhereIsMySpoon: you're testing to make sure that a certain execution path on your website succeeds
[2015-01-23 04:31:34] BW^-: ok looks like you need different profiles for that..
[2015-01-23 04:31:50] WhereIsMySpoon: you dont want to take a slightly different eceution path sometimes
[2015-01-23 04:32:06] WhereIsMySpoon: that circumvents one of the most important things about automation which is reliability
[2015-01-23 04:35:11] shteou: BW^-: I can't see any way to do it via commandline
[2015-01-23 04:35:17] shteou: I think the XPI references only the profile
[2015-01-23 04:35:23] mers: WhereIsMySpoon: it depends on how you define an execution path. when a site changes in layout, e.g., has the execution path changed?
[2015-01-23 04:35:24] shteou: I may be wrong, but that's all I can see at a quick glance
[2015-01-23 04:35:32] BW^-: shteou: no setting those config settings did not make it start listening =(
[2015-01-23 04:35:51] WhereIsMySpoon: mers: then the underlying written test case will change
[2015-01-23 04:35:53] BW^-: shteou: ok this is fine - so now, how do I make my firefox profile make Webdriver start listening on HTTP on port 7055?
[2015-01-23 04:36:02] WhereIsMySpoon: and you need to refactor your test

[2015-01-23 04:36:08] WhereIsMySpoon: that needs to be an actual effort done

[2015-01-23 04:36:21] WhereIsMySpoon: not something that you hope can be achieved by your list of similar selectors
[2015-01-23 04:36:28] BW^-: shteou: so, my firefox does say "Webdriver" in the bottom-most right corner!
[2015-01-23 04:36:36] BW^-: shteou: but, telnet localhost 7055 shows nothing!
