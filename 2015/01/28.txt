[2015-01-28 01:55:59] shteou: adac: With Chrome/Firefox I think they default to unique sessions. This is essentially what the private browsing sessions do (they create a new session so that it has no cookies etc. and clear it down when all private session tabs are closed)

[2015-01-28 08:58:20] dude-x: msi2: do you know about WebDriverWait?
[2015-01-28 08:58:30] kbarry, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-28 08:58:49] msi2: basically just wait x-seconds?
[2015-01-28 08:58:56] WhereIsMySpoon: not quite
[2015-01-28 08:59:04] WhereIsMySpoon: its like a retry functionality

[2015-01-28 09:00:13] kbarry: shteou YT?
[2015-01-28 09:00:24] shteou: Hey kbarry
[2015-01-28 09:00:26] msi2: I'm using that
[2015-01-28 09:00:57] WhereIsMySpoon: if you were using that you wouldnt get an nosuchelementexception
[2015-01-28 09:01:01] WhereIsMySpoon: you'd get a timeoutexception
[2015-01-28 09:01:23] kbarry: shteou: I'm wondering, when using grid where are the divisions of tests made, in other words, if Grid can run things in parallel, how does Grid know how many tests are there, that can be run in parallel?
[2015-01-28 09:01:35] msi2: ...hmm...how do you set it?
[2015-01-28 09:01:41] kbarry: is that usually handled, per file?
[2015-01-28 09:01:44] WhereIsMySpoon: set what, msi2?
[2015-01-28 09:02:23] shteou: kbarry: Grid (Selenium Server) just knows what capabilities there are on its nodes, including maxsessions/maxinstances
[2015-01-28 09:02:42] WhereIsMySpoon: kbarry: grid does not manage parallel running of tests
[2015-01-28 09:02:46] kbarry: I got that part, and if can even be set, when starting the node.
[2015-01-28 09:02:53] AutomatedTester: jleyba: hey, how do I raise a bug against gmail?
[2015-01-28 09:02:53] WhereIsMySpoon: you have to do that yourself, grid just enables the ability for it to happen
[2015-01-28 09:02:57] msi2: Wait, I set the ImplicitlyWait is that different?
[2015-01-28 09:03:06] shteou: Usually your tests will just keep executing, requesting a new browser session each time, if grid can't satisfy it, it will block for a while then timeout
[2015-01-28 09:03:08] kbarry: WhereIsMySpoon: Right, im really asking about that,
[2015-01-28 09:03:08] WhereIsMySpoon: msi2: that is totally different and not something you should do anyway
[2015-01-28 09:03:23] WhereIsMySpoon: implicit waits are an internal thing and subject to change at any time
[2015-01-28 09:03:30] WhereIsMySpoon: use an explicit wait like a webdriverwait or a fluent wait
[2015-01-28 09:03:31] kbarry: What does it look like to have grid run several tests?
[2015-01-28 09:03:32] jleyba: AutomatedTester: gear menu > “Report Google.com mail bug"
[2015-01-28 09:03:40] shteou: WhereIsMySpoon: If you have your own requirements on limitations then you would code them in
[2015-01-28 09:04:01] shteou: but it may be acceptable to just, e.g., fire up a few batch runs and let selenium server block
[2015-01-28 09:04:05] WhereIsMySpoon: kbarry: for(Test test : myTestClassList) { spawnNewProcessAndRunTest(); }
[2015-01-28 09:04:10] shteou: and your tests will get executed when they can
[2015-01-28 09:04:17] kbarry: Im not sure how to run more than one test at a time. I mean, I am testing several things in my [test.rb] files, but i am only running one file at a time.
[2015-01-28 09:04:21] jleyba: AutomatedTester: nevermind, that’s not right
[2015-01-28 09:04:30] shteou: kbarry: It would depend on your testing stack
[2015-01-28 09:04:38] shteou: are you using a testing framework, how do you do reporting, etc.?
[2015-01-28 09:04:43] WhereIsMySpoon: kbarry: if you have no real testing framework or stack that would be how you do it
[2015-01-28 09:04:51] WhereIsMySpoon: you literally have to spawn a new process for each new test you want to run
[2015-01-28 09:05:19] shteou: Or run in batches
[2015-01-28 09:05:27] kbarry: WhereIsMySpoon: I cant answer, Im too new, (I didnt even know tests had frameworks ;)
[2015-01-28 09:05:52] kbarry: Initially I see Grid as a way for us to get away from running tests
[2015-01-28 09:05:55] kbarry: locally
[2015-01-28 09:06:05] WhereIsMySpoon: msi2: so lets say you have a very simple test, you want to go to a url, type in a username and password, press the login button, and wait for your main home page to come up
[2015-01-28 09:06:16] jleyba: AutomatedTester: I can’t find the feedback link :(
[2015-01-28 09:06:40] kbarry: so each test developer will be able to run their tests on the same hardware, instead of there possibly being differences between his laptop, and my laptop.
[2015-01-28 09:07:33] kbarry: The second benefit "might" be running things in parallel (I say might, because the refactoring of the tests may be staggering to undertake immediately.)

[2015-01-28 09:23:35] kbarry: OK,
[2015-01-28 09:23:46] shteou: So you might kick off different configurations of your test suite (+ framework) with rake

[2015-01-28 09:49:29] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: i… see…

[2015-01-28 09:49:42] kbarry: We use Testlink, but its not integrated yet,
[2015-01-28 09:49:43] WhereIsMySpoon: jimevans: its your capital...
[2015-01-28 09:49:50] shteou: kbarry: I feel for you :P
[2015-01-28 09:50:03] kbarry: (I think it might be possible to integrate the results on-screen, to be placed into testlink automagically.)
[2015-01-28 09:50:18] jimevans: WhereIsMySpoon: indeed it is. which is one of only two reasons to actually go to tallahassee
[2015-01-28 09:50:27] WhereIsMySpoon: whats the other
[2015-01-28 09:50:29] kbarry: shteou: Is that because testlink is bad, or not having it inetgrated?

[2015-01-28 09:51:51] kbarry: So, seeing others manually use a tool makes me feel tired :)
[2015-01-28 09:52:05] shteou: Anyway, in our setup we have three cucumber tasks which are run in Jenkins. These output to JUnit XML format which are trivial to merge

[2015-01-28 09:57:06] kbarry: shteou: I'm guessing its nor reasonable to have each thing thats being tested run a s a separate "entity (something that grid will direct to takeup an session on a node and test)
[2015-01-28 09:57:17] WhereIsMySpoon: shri: that'll be org.json jar probably
[2015-01-28 09:57:27] kbarry: Like, we test some 50 elements on our main page. (as an example)

[2015-01-28 09:58:03] shri: but I shouldn't have to download it explicitly correct?
[2015-01-28 09:58:06] kbarry: It wouldnt be faster to have a grid with capabilities of handling 25 parallel tests, then send that batch of tests to grid, and have it do them 25 in parallel.

[2015-01-28 10:08:40] shteou: You'd be throwing hardware at running very, very specific test cases which might give you as much trouble as benefit in terms of pinpointing an issue
[2015-01-28 10:09:07] shteou: It's probably very infrequent that, e.g., if you are running your tests frequently enough a developer breaks two separate elements
[2015-01-28 10:09:36] shteou: and you get immediate feedback on which two elements... but in all liklihood once you investigate the issue manually you would notice the issue anyway :p
