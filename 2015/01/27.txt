[2015-01-27 04:54:01] BW^-: Weird - with Webdriver.xpi, I have an issue that ifI make an xpath elements query for an "//input[@id='login']" and that does not exist,
[2015-01-27 04:54:14] BW^-: then the HTTP request just stops and then times out, i.e. something in the Firefox webdriver crashes
[2015-01-27 04:54:24] BW^-: this is a 12-24mo old Webdriver.xpi so maybe I should update, though, nonetheless it's weird
[2015-01-27 04:54:28] dubner, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-27 04:56:22] BW^-: so "//div[@class='dsifjlogin']" crashes it too.
[2015-01-27 04:57:54] BW^-: let's see if I can get hold of a newer webdriver.xpi .
[2015-01-27 04:59:34] BW^-: shteou: any idea?

[2015-01-27 05:06:59] shteou: BW^-: Personally I _never_ use xpath
[2015-01-27 05:07:37] BW^-: shteou: really, why?
[2015-01-27 05:07:41] shteou: If I can't do it with id/class/css or some procedural combination I would stab the devs :D
[2015-01-27 05:07:45] BW^-: what do you use instead for hopping around in DOM:s?
[2015-01-27 05:07:53] BW^-: aha interesting.
[2015-01-27 05:08:31] shteou: I don't see any need for XPath, so far my experience has been if I can't do it as above then there's probably an underlying issue (i.e. the DOM reeks, tidy it up please)
[2015-01-27 05:09:06] shteou: There were some (maybe historic now) reasons for not using XPath in the first place... but this approach has served me well
[2015-01-27 05:11:44] AutomatedTester: BW^-: 12 months? There have been at least 8 releases in that time frame
[2015-01-27 05:12:22] shteou: BW^-: btw, one reservation I have with my approach is sometimes I could perform an XPath statement with potentially better performance characteristics than multiple ID/class/css selectors... but then there's maintainability to take into account and I don't like staring at monolithic XPath

[2015-01-27 05:12:59] shteou: and I find the performance isn't that much of an issue, especially when compared with "sleep 5 # HACK: Fix this" littered through my inherited codebase :(

[2015-01-27 05:26:57] BW^-: umm
[2015-01-27 05:27:15] BW^-: with the latest Webdriver.xpi , I get the error that it could not be installed because "it's not compatible with Firefox 22.0".
[2015-01-27 05:27:45] BW^-: shteou,AutomatedTester,*: is this because i use an unusual OS or is it an actual Firefox version issue?
[2015-01-27 05:28:22] AutomatedTester: BW^-: we don't support Firefox 22
[2015-01-27 05:30:16] BW^-: aha super
[2015-01-27 05:30:19] BW^-: AutomatedTester: which is the oldest firefox you support now?
[2015-01-27 05:30:40] BW^-: AutomatedTester: do you have any idea in what version Webdriver most recently supported Firefox 22?
[2015-01-27 05:31:48] BW^-: automatedtester: and do you have any idea which Firefox version is required at least?
[2015-01-27 05:32:05] AutomatedTester: BW^-: 2.44 supports Firefox 33 and 34
[2015-01-27 05:32:09] AutomatedTester: and mostly 35
[2015-01-27 05:32:15] BW^-: mhm
[2015-01-27 05:32:56] BW^-: automatedtester: does any relevant Webdriver release support Firefox 22?
[2015-01-27 05:33:08] AutomatedTester: probably but I dont know off hand
[2015-01-27 05:33:20] BW^-: mhm
[2015-01-27 05:33:21] AutomatedTester: I would guess something like 2.33
[2015-01-27 05:34:03] BW^-: mhm
[2015-01-27 05:34:19] BW^-: AutomatedTester: so, my issue is that ELEMENT operation XPath query for nonexistant object crashes the HTTP connection
[2015-01-27 05:34:33] AndreiH, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2015-01-27 05:34:37] AutomatedTester: BW^-: that sounds like a bug we had a while ago and we fixed it
[2015-01-27 05:34:43] BW^-: that is a really really weird bug, maybe it's that there's something in Firefox' DOM on that page that the XPath implementation can't handle

[2015-01-27 05:35:07] BW^-: automatedtester: i'm on a BSD with not too many firefoxes
[2015-01-27 05:35:24] BW^-: automatedtester: with some luck, I can get hold of Firefox version 31, I think
[2015-01-27 05:36:23] ato: Firefox should compile fine on BSD.
[2015-01-27 05:36:27] ato: At least it does on FreeBSD.
[2015-01-27 05:36:35] BW^-: ato: it works well on OpenBSD too.
[2015-01-27 05:36:40] BW^-: automatedtester,ato: If I get hold of Firefox 31, should I be "safe" then?
[2015-01-27 05:36:43] ato: There's even a 35 port.
[2015-01-27 05:37:00] BW^-: ato: I'm on OpenBSD, the latest stable version there that I see is ff31.
[2015-01-27 05:37:06] BW^-: w8.. maybe..
[2015-01-27 05:38:01] ato: But anyway.  It's usually in the release notes or the change log which Firefox versions a particular release supports.
[2015-01-27 05:38:37] BW^-: aha
[2015-01-27 05:38:41] BW^-: ato: where can I read that?
[2015-01-27 05:38:46] ato: BW^-: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/CHANGELOG
[2015-01-27 05:38:53] BW^-: ato: sorry i ask because i see all these download urls, and am on slow connection
[2015-01-27 05:38:58] BW^-: awesome
[2015-01-27 05:39:06] AutomatedTester: I can't find anything bu I remember there was an issue
[2015-01-27 05:39:14] BW^-: yey, maybe I can get hold of Firefox v35
[2015-01-27 05:39:17] AutomatedTester: it was the way we were doing findElement
[2015-01-27 05:39:29] BW^-: AutomatedTester: my current Webdriver.xpi is from December 2013
[2015-01-27 05:39:41] AutomatedTester: BW^-: wow
[2015-01-27 05:39:58] BW^-: ato: aha, so the changelog says for 2.44.0: " * Updating Native events to support Firefox 24, 31, 32 and 33"
[2015-01-27 05:40:08] BW^-: ato,AutomatedTester: so that means that FF24 is supported too?
[2015-01-27 05:40:11] BW^-: and ff32
[2015-01-27 05:40:13] BW^-: by 2.440
[2015-01-27 05:40:15] BW^-: 2.440
[2015-01-27 05:40:16] BW^-: 2.44.0
[2015-01-27 05:40:21] AutomatedTester: um only the ESR
[2015-01-27 05:40:32] BW^-: AutomatedTester: wow = that's sooo old?
[2015-01-27 05:40:38] AutomatedTester: yea
[2015-01-27 05:40:41] BW^-: AutomatedTester: wait, ESR?
[2015-01-27 05:40:42] BW^-: mhm
[2015-01-27 05:40:51] ato: Unfortunately web browsers are a fresh commodity.
[2015-01-27 05:41:04] AutomatedTester: extended support r....
[2015-01-27 05:41:08] AutomatedTester: release
[2015-01-27 05:41:08] BW^-: aha
[2015-01-27 05:41:10] BW^-: right
[2015-01-27 05:41:16] BW^-: ato: aha, crap.
[2015-01-27 05:41:32] BW^-: AutomatedTester,ato: I think I'll try to get Firefox v32 going - that note above mentions ff32
[2015-01-27 05:41:33] BW^-: sounds fair?
[2015-01-27 05:41:38] BW^-: or should I better try ff35?
[2015-01-27 05:41:49] AutomatedTester: BW^-: 34 if you can get it or 31
[2015-01-27 05:41:58] AutomatedTester: 31 will give you more life
[2015-01-27 05:42:08] AutomatedTester: since you get that ESR version
[2015-01-27 05:42:22] BW^-: AutomatedTester: the options I see are version 22, 26 and 32.
[2015-01-27 05:42:31] BW^-: AutomatedTester: and 35
[2015-01-27 05:42:36] BW^-: AutomatedTester: i can get any of those for my OS
[2015-01-27 05:42:45] AutomatedTester: um...
[2015-01-27 05:42:47] BW^-: AutomatedTester: maybe with Lots of digging I could find 31 or 34
[2015-01-27 05:42:59] AutomatedTester: 35 has issues at the moment
[2015-01-27 05:43:13] AutomatedTester: so try 2.43 with 32 then
[2015-01-27 05:43:21] AutomatedTester: Selenium 2.43 with Firefox 32
[2015-01-27 05:43:54] BW^-: AutomatedTester: awesome, thanks, i'll give it a shot.
[2015-01-27 05:43:59] BW^-: waaaaait
[2015-01-27 05:43:59] BW^-: sorry
[2015-01-27 05:44:05] BW^-: AutomatedTester: I read wrong, it's Firefox 31 that I can probably get hold of
[2015-01-27 05:44:24] AutomatedTester: If you struggle to do updates follow ESRs
[2015-01-27 05:44:29] BW^-: AutomatedTester: for Firefox 31, which version did you say I should try to use?
[2015-01-27 05:44:32] BW^-: mhm
[2015-01-27 05:44:37] AutomatedTester: 31 is an ESR
[2015-01-27 05:44:43] BW^-: AutomatedTester: Which Webdriver version for Firefox 31
[2015-01-27 05:44:51] AutomatedTester: 2.44 should support it
[2015-01-27 05:44:59] BW^-: super.
[2015-01-27 05:45:07] BW^-: AutomatedTester: ok, let's see if it compiles.

[2015-01-27 11:02:24] jleyba: if they are including jquery in the injected script, that's a bit different
[2015-01-27 11:03:02] jleyba: but findElements(By.cssSelector("#browse-deals .deal-card")) would be better
[2015-01-27 11:03:14] dimacus: jleyba: well that's my assumption also

[2015-01-27 11:57:05] lukeis: what language are you writing your webdriver code in?
[2015-01-27 11:57:29] BW^-: lukeis: none, there's nothing
[2015-01-27 11:57:38] BW^-: so for refresh there's  http://localhost:7055/hub/session/dfffcc96-c43e-46b9-8093-5259e70ce1d1/refresh
[2015-01-27 11:57:39] lukeis: why do you care about the url endpoints? it's an implementation detail of a language binding

[2015-01-27 12:01:46] BW^-: lukeis: I have checked.
[2015-01-27 12:01:53] jleyba: lukeis: except for php. always need more of those
[2015-01-27 12:01:54] lukeis: without telling us what language?
[2015-01-27 12:01:56] barancev: php? :)
[2015-01-27 12:02:02] lukeis: heh

[2015-01-27 12:07:59] jleyba: is quit

[2015-01-27 12:08:54] BW^-: ..I noted that the bug I encountered in the old Webdriver I use, can be worked around by starting a new Webdriver session from scratch
[2015-01-27 12:08:57] BW^-: so this way ran into the quit call for first time.

[2015-01-27 12:19:18] BW^-: jleyba: ouch, the delete call actually closes Firefox.
[2015-01-27 12:19:31] jleyba: yes, that's what driver.quit() does
[2015-01-27 12:19:36] BW^-: mhm
[2015-01-27 12:19:37] BW^-: good to know.
[2015-01-27 12:19:53] BW^-: jleyba: is there any other way to make Webdriver  deallocate all memory it used up for a session?
[2015-01-27 12:21:48] BW^-: so just like,   http://localhost:7055/hub/session/dfffcc96-c43e-46b9-8093-5259e70ce1d1/delete_every_memory_and_record_about_this_session

[2015-01-27 12:22:24] BW^-: anyhow, this leak is not big enough for me to give additional consideration now I think..
[2015-01-27 12:22:31] BW^-: can't be more than some KB of memory for each session
[2015-01-27 12:22:36] jleyba: close just closes the currently selected window
[2015-01-27 12:22:59] BW^-: mhm
[2015-01-27 12:23:49] BW^-: ok i understand the ramifications - very well, if i'd follow up on that one, i'd write a shellscript that restarted firefox automatically

[2015-01-27 13:53:08] AutomatedTester: I have worked directly with the JSONWireProtocol... its just a transport layer that shouldnt really be exposed to end users
[2015-01-27 13:53:14] jleyba: webdriver cannot execute concurrent commands
[2015-01-27 13:53:32] SomeFrontendGuy: Did I make a different stupid mistake? :)
[2015-01-27 13:53:35] jleyba: so even if the client sent two findElement commands at once, they will be executed in the order received by webdriver
[2015-01-27 13:53:49] jleyba: (or should be, behavior is actually "undefined")
[2015-01-27 13:53:56] lukeis: jleyba: that depends on implementation ;)
[2015-01-27 13:54:39] lukeis: selendroid would happily attempt to handle both requests concurrently… since they don't modify the state… but i wouldn't recommend it :)
[2015-01-27 13:54:39] SomeFrontendGuy: so you mean internally webdriver will actually block when it's waiting for something to appear?

[2015-01-27 13:56:00] AutomatedTester: a-ha... sure...
[2015-01-27 13:56:20] jleyba: selenium-webdriver is stricter: commands issued within a control flow must go in order and is gated on the client rather than punting to the server
[2015-01-27 13:57:20] SomeFrontendGuy: so basically you always have to know what to expect, or risk waiting for a long time cycling through all possibilities

[2015-01-27 14:55:05] _Druid_: jleyba: i see a lot of people who want to control */%session_id%/* , why not solve the problem?
[2015-01-27 14:55:29] jleyba: _Druid_: what? think we're talking about different issues
[2015-01-27 14:56:47] jleyba: I'm talking about the w3c spec's requirement that webdriver set `window.navigator.webdriver === true` so pages can detect webdriver

[2015-01-27 14:58:34] SomeFrontendGuy: for me it's not about session_id, it's about being able to send a useragent that gets the mobile page. but at least the chrome arguments thing solves it. and I kind of understand why header control isn't available. it's not like a "normal" user has control over their headers when they enter a URL. just a pity that you have to come up with rube-goldbergesque setups to satisfy all your testing needs :)

[2015-01-27 14:59:42] _Druid_: jleyba: yes, i'm wrong with SomeFrontendGuy question, i'm confused beacouse i use FF, and was easy to change user-agent by custom profile. Sry
[2015-01-27 15:01:46] AutomatedTester: jleyba: would love it if Sam Uong implemented and gave me implementors feedback
[2015-01-27 15:02:04] AutomatedTester: jleyba: it's not at the top of my priority for Firefox tbqh
[2015-01-27 15:02:22] SomeFrontendGuy: languages are another good use case (accept-language headers), but I'm not gonna beat a dead horse here ;)
[2015-01-27 15:02:31] simonstewart, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-27 15:03:09] AutomatedTester: SomeFrontendGuy: ideally you should be able to set those through preferences before the browser loads using capabilities
[2015-01-27 15:03:22] AutomatedTester: (not sure if someone already gave that answer)
[2015-01-27 15:03:25] _Druid_: SomeFrontendGuy: i see on about:config of FF , intl.accept_languages , you can try to use firefox, is more easy..for me mby.. :)
[2015-01-27 15:04:03] SomeFrontendGuy: yes, that's my current solution. it works well enough and I found a way to abstract it away nicely for the users.
[2015-01-27 15:05:33] _Druid_: jleyba: sites can detect if i use webdriver?
[2015-01-27 15:05:42] AutomatedTester: _Druid_: yes
[2015-01-27 15:05:54] _Druid_: AutomatedTester: how can i detect this?

[2015-01-27 15:06:55] AutomatedTester: _Druid_: the current FirefoxDriver does fingerprint the page that it is on

[2015-01-27 15:07:47] AutomatedTester: _Druid_: the way I wrote this part of the spec should make it more palatable for browser vendors
[2015-01-27 15:08:25] AutomatedTester: since our current fingerprinting makes the HTML slightly invalid
[2015-01-27 15:10:02] SomeFrontendGuy: it would actually be really awesome if implemented consistently. that way the app could see if it's being tested and load additional scripts to move some test automation to the client using executeAsyncScript
[2015-01-27 15:10:54] SomeFrontendGuy: AutomatedTester: you mean "This can be used to prevent denial of service attacks." with "more palatable"?
[2015-01-27 15:11:26] AutomatedTester: SomeFrontendGuy: making sure we using browser idioms and not make valid html invalid
[2015-01-27 15:11:43] SomeFrontendGuy: well, yeah, that sounds more palatable. what's the current solution then?
[2015-01-27 15:11:56] AutomatedTester: we add an attribute to body
[2015-01-27 15:12:08] AutomatedTester: if using FirefoxDriver
[2015-01-27 15:12:23] AutomatedTester: not sure if the other browser implementations do that
[2015-01-27 15:13:07] AutomatedTester: jleyba: fyi, there is an email in the dev mailing list that is screaming for your reply :P
[2015-01-27 15:13:32] jleyba: barancev's vote?
[2015-01-27 15:13:44] AutomatedTester: no, the JSONWP
[2015-01-27 15:14:17] AutomatedTester: "why is findElements and findElement asymetrical"
[2015-01-27 15:14:38] AutomatedTester: To keep people on their toes
[2015-01-27 15:21:15] jleyba: b/c simon designed findElement to be an implicit assertion that the element is present on the page
[2015-01-27 15:21:50] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: can reply then :)
[2015-01-27 15:23:43] jleyba: findElement never returning null is another nice argument :)
[2015-01-27 15:24:34] AutomatedTester: I quite like the, let's not use exception handling as conditionals
[2015-01-27 15:24:39] AutomatedTester: argument

[2015-01-27 15:51:50] simonstewart: Never returning null is a lovely thing to do.
[2015-01-27 15:52:26] simonstewart: WebDriver started life as a relatively fluent interface. The expected usage was always something like: driver.findElement(By.id()).click(); or similar
[2015-01-27 15:52:39] simonstewart: If `findElement` returned null, you'd get a NullPointerException
[2015-01-27 15:52:49] simonstewart: Which is shit, and doesn't convey interesting information
