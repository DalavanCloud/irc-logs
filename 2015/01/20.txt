[2015-01-20 02:47:47] Eigenvalue: Hello, I am attempting to download an image using webdriver/firefox. Unfortunately, firefox insists on using a built-in viewer to open the image, rather than downloading it. Any ideas how to resolve this?
[2015-01-20 02:51:05] bimmelino: hm, thats an usual task. i would rather take the url and download it via the API the test is written in.
[2015-01-20 02:51:05] bimmelino: curl(url);
[2015-01-20 02:52:08] bimmelino: nevertheless webdriver is a great help to gather the urls you're interested in
[2015-01-20 02:53:50] bimmelino: on top the download mechanism (auto-download or not) is user specific which makes it even harder to use firefox to download it
[2015-01-20 02:55:26] Eigenvalue: I am able to get most other file types to download automatically. However, image files such as png, jpg, gif seem to be presenting a rather stubborn problem.

[2015-01-20 09:19:44] jimevans: barancev: until mozilla ships .obj files for linking in VS2013 format in the gecko sdk, we can't link the native events libs.
[2015-01-20 09:19:58] jimevans: in theory, that's in the pipeline, but it's not released in the main line yet.
[2015-01-20 09:20:19] barancev: ah, ok
[2015-01-20 09:20:51] jimevans: i believe the cutover happened in nightly around 15 december, which means it's likely in aurora now.
[2015-01-20 09:20:59] barancev: so we will not be able to use the same VS version for "old" and "new" versions of gecko?
[2015-01-20 09:21:05] jimevans: nope.
[2015-01-20 09:21:05] barancev: because we support two ESR versions
[2015-01-20 09:21:27] jimevans: yeah, but those binaries shouldn't have to be rebuilt. just renamed as new ESR builds come along.
[2015-01-20 09:21:57] barancev: right
[2015-01-20 09:22:02] jimevans: afaik the sdks aren't refreshed for ESR release refreshes.

[2015-01-20 12:46:14] jleyba: AutomatedTester: I may have asked you this before, but would it be possible to start delegating to Marionette from our extension?
[2015-01-20 12:46:18] lukeis: FF 35 has issues with Alert handling though (if i take an internal users word for the issue)
[2015-01-20 12:46:42] AutomatedTester: jleyba: hmmm.... not sure good question
[2015-01-20 12:46:54] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I can't see why not off the top of my head
[2015-01-20 12:47:22] jleyba: If we can, gutting native events might be a nice place to start.

[2015-01-20 12:51:44] AutomatedTester: jleyba: we dont have the browser not focused stuff
[2015-01-20 12:51:49] AutomatedTester: well we do and we don't
[2015-01-20 12:52:02] AutomatedTester: "browser in focus" is slightly contentious
[2015-01-20 12:52:21] jleyba: AutomatedTester: pretty sure that's just an extra .so that gets loaded to block blur events
[2015-01-20 12:55:39] AutomatedTester: jleyba: not sure how they would interact together
[2015-01-20 12:55:53] AutomatedTester: we inject trusted events into the event loop

[2015-01-20 12:56:24] AutomatedTester: our current approach injects into the OS event loop
[2015-01-20 12:57:17] jleyba: AutomatedTester: is there an xpcom component for marionette? webdriver.xpi could get a reference and call the appropriate method
[2015-01-20 12:57:44] AutomatedTester: let me look into
[2015-01-20 12:57:47] AutomatedTester: I like the idea
[2015-01-20 12:58:20] AutomatedTester: at worst we can get the webdriver.xpi to open a TCP socket in to marionette
[2015-01-20 12:59:09] AutomatedTester: *facepalm*
[2015-01-20 12:59:56] AutomatedTester: jimevans: did you ever get EventUtils.jsm working in webdriver.xpi
[2015-01-20 13:00:46] jimevans: i recall vaguely that i did, yes, but that was quite some time ago.
[2015-01-20 13:00:59] jimevans: i'll have to look and see if i saved that work in a branch.
[2015-01-20 13:02:55] jimevans: but yeah, i remember that i did get it working without too much trouble.
[2015-01-20 13:03:09] AutomatedTester: ok, I might try see about getting that working
[2015-01-20 13:03:25] AutomatedTester: seeing the last comment in the bug that appears to be the way forward
