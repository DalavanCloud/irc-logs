[2015-01-16 08:26:43] jimevans: that's probably the initial "fix up the temporary anonymous profile the driver uses" launch of firefox.

[2015-01-16 08:31:58] jimevans: computa_mike: i'd try a newer version of webdriver before downgrading firefox.

[2015-01-16 08:32:26] jimevans: 31 would work, yes, but only because it's an ESR version, so it's supported for 12+ months.

Thanks for your advice guys - I'm going to have to leave the channel temporarily - I'm at work, and I'm about to drive home, but I'll leave myself logged on here so you can shout abuse at me (and NuGet) if you want, and I'll reconnect when I get back.
[2015-01-16 08:37:20] computa_mike: thanks again -
[2015-01-16 08:37:26] jimevans: although i will say maven's use of xml as a description format is a strong case against.
[2015-01-16 08:37:33] WhereIsMySpoon: ato: aha I see. So how do future bug releases that want to get put into ESR versions get merged? do you branch from the latest ESR commit always?
[2015-01-16 08:37:45] WhereIsMySpoon: assuming git..
[2015-01-16 08:37:51] WhereIsMySpoon: if not then dont worry
[2015-01-16 08:38:38] ato: ESR's are “branched off” and have security patches uplifted to them.

[2015-01-16 08:41:09] ato: Historically, when Mozilla switched from CVS to Mercurial, git wasn't a viable option.
[2015-01-16 08:41:29] ato: It had poor support for Windows, which was a major factor for choosing Mercurial.

[2015-01-16 08:42:26] ato: Nowadays there's a strong base of developers who still prefer Mercurial, but we also have git mirrors and tooling for those who prefer that.
