[2015-01-21 10:38:11] kyoob: have you seen something like that before?  the test just started breaking today though i can'r recall whether chrome at one point looked liked <div rendered=""> or if it was just the attribute the whole time
[2015-01-21 10:41:19] bbark1231, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2015-01-21 10:44:28] kyoob: actually that still fails.  also tried xpath //div[@rendered] but webdriver can't find it.  checked in debug and it's there to be found.
[2015-01-21 10:44:40] stan, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-21 10:44:58] kyoob: does wd fail on an attribute with a null value?
[2015-01-21 10:45:35] jimevans: kyoob: what happens when you try to use the browser's developer console with css selectors?
[2015-01-21 10:46:11] jimevans: that would be the litmus test.
[2015-01-21 10:46:30] kyoob: my js is weak.  lemme google that.  firepath finds it, but then firepath has an empty string whereas chrome is null
[2015-01-21 10:46:32] jimevans: if you can't do it in the browser developer tools, the driver will never be able to find it.
[2015-01-21 10:47:10] jimevans: document.querySelector('div[rendered]')
[2015-01-21 10:47:29] kyoob: so like document.querySelector([rendered]); ?
[2015-01-21 10:47:33] kyoob: ha thanks
[2015-01-21 10:47:46] jimevans: yep. except enclose the selector in quotes.
[2015-01-21 10:48:02] jimevans: document.querySelector("[rendered]")
[2015-01-21 10:48:28] kyoob: came back fine, but let me try it while debugging
[2015-01-21 10:48:51] jimevans: "came back fine" means what? did it find the element?
[2015-01-21 10:52:39] kyoob: yes, looking in the console, i found it
[2015-01-21 10:54:29] kyoob: but webdriver times out waiting for it
[2015-01-21 10:54:34] kyoob: this is java btw
[2015-01-21 10:55:25] jimevans: so in the developer console of the browser, when you enter document.querySelector("[rendered]"), that returns an element in the console?

[2015-01-21 11:00:39] kyoob: sorry, i might be over answering.  the answer is yes, when i enter that statement in chrome's console, it returns the element
[2015-01-21 11:01:08] jleyba: kyoob: what about driver.executeScript("return driver.querySelector('div[rendered]');")

[2015-01-21 11:07:00] kyoob: sorry, i meant on the inside, should that be driver.executeScript("return document.quesrySelector('div[rendered]');); ?
