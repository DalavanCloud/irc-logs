[2015-01-29 02:39:37] selbot2_____: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[2015-01-29 02:39:48] Dave_B_: specific questions you'll probably get help with
[2015-01-29 02:39:55] Dave_B_: generic ones are hard :(
[2015-01-29 02:40:18] sharebeyoid: ok right
[2015-01-29 02:40:57] *Dave_B_ doesn't use java so probably other people in the channel will be more useful, just giving general info :)'

[2015-01-29 12:26:46] geocat: Execution of checkmaps.edited aborted due to compilation errors.
[2015-01-29 12:26:46] geocat: # Looks like your test exited with 255 before it could output anything." - ive taken a look at line 31 and around the elseif statement however i am no perl expert and am unsure how the clean script is breaking it. Note test works from start to end under selenium IDE
[2015-01-29 12:31:17] geocat: im testing at the moment but this appears to have something to do with $sel->pause(3000);

[2015-01-29 12:32:01] geocat: if i remove those from the script it allows it to progress further, however the pauses are in there to allow the site to load.

[2015-01-29 13:18:02] dimacus: jleyba: are you gonna be nice to me today? or i won't talk to you at all :-P
[2015-01-29 13:18:10] dimacus: no mean people allowed
[2015-01-29 13:18:25] dimacus: :-D
[2015-01-29 13:18:43] jleyba: dimacus: proposal for you: rip out auto-installation of SafariDriver extension for OSX. bump min supported version to Safari 7
[2015-01-29 13:19:12] dimacus: so only install by hand similar to how iedriver needs to be installed?
[2015-01-29 13:19:19] jleyba: yes
[2015-01-29 13:19:34] dimacus: i mean by far that's the best solution i've heard since i started to chase my own tail
[2015-01-29 13:20:06] jleyba: messing with the keychain is just a royal pita
[2015-01-29 13:20:33] dimacus: yeah, i'm completely down for this idea
[2015-01-29 13:21:15] dimacus: ok i can do that tomorrow if there is not going to be any hate towards me for implementing such heresey
[2015-01-29 13:21:26] jleyba: manual installation wouldn't be hard anyway... we'd just publish the extension with the rest of the release bits and a user opens it with safari
[2015-01-29 13:21:37] dimacus: yeah
[2015-01-29 13:21:41] dimacus: don't even need to do that
[2015-01-29 13:22:18] dimacus: but yeah do a test, if it's not installed, then write in error log "go to this site for install instructions"
[2015-01-29 13:22:26] dimacus: i love it jleyba
[2015-01-29 13:24:02] dimacus: jleyba: i'll be honest, the amount of code i've written so far to have support for 10.8, 9, 10 at the same time is starting to compete with total project size
[2015-01-29 13:24:11] dimacus: a nice clean up will work awesome
[2015-01-29 13:24:21] jleyba: dimacus: we could just update the bootstrap html to have a giant banner message: "if this fails, make sure you've installed the extension here[link]"
[2015-01-29 13:24:33] dimacus: yeah already did that
[2015-01-29 13:24:49] dimacus: but mine says so far "trying to install, if it fails, follow these steps"

[2015-01-29 13:26:25] dimacus: i have no problem with that
[2015-01-29 13:26:29] dimacus: less to debug

[2015-01-29 13:28:42] dimacus: jleyba: it's a huge change though, should this be aproved by a majority vote or something?
[2015-01-29 13:30:13] jleyba: dimacus: I'd do it unilaterally
[2015-01-29 13:30:29] jleyba: If someone from the community objects they can step up and contribute code to fix auto-installation
[2015-01-29 13:31:34] dimacus: ok well as long as you say it's a good idea it's good enough for me, i do love to delete me some code :)
[2015-01-29 13:31:41] dimacus: i'll get on it my friend

[2015-01-29 15:51:21] Harry__: I was wondering if there's a way to execute some arbritrary remote command on the remote selenium side. For instance, to get something from the remote selenium temporary profile. Is such channel available between the client and the server?
[2015-01-29 15:51:53] Harry__: s/remote selenium/remote chrome/

[2015-01-29 15:55:24] Harry__: To give you some context, the problem is that in my testing I'm testing a flash app (I know it sucks :)) and it has some default value in a .sol file within the profile that needs to be changed in order to skip a really annoying popup

[2015-01-29 15:56:18] Harry__: now, this can easily be done if running a local selenium (since the client code has access to the file system), however I was wondering if there's a way to also do it remotely through selenium without opening another communication channel

[2015-01-29 17:52:15] bfisher-fleig: it's just much easier to build a docker/vagrant/virtualbox from an ubuntu server image. canonical doesn't seem to distribute desktop builds that nicely packaged for vms/containers
