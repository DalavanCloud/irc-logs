[2015-01-30 08:12:21] brooksch: Anyone use selenium to download files with firefox?

[2015-01-30 08:13:47] WhereIsMySpoon: if the browser is sending a certain header i think it will always give u the dialog
[2015-01-30 08:14:05] jarib: the preference trick should work. have you set the neverAsk.saveToDisk pref to the correct content-type?
[2015-01-30 08:14:08] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-30 08:14:17] WhereIsMySpoon: ahhhhh thats it
[2015-01-30 08:15:35] brooksch: jarib, I think so.  When I boot up my regular firefox it saves the csv downloads automatically without problem, since I just clicked on the save and always on the dialog.  But when I go to about:config the neverAsk.saveToDisk preference is empty still.  This suggested to me that this preference is maybe out dated and is no longer where firefox saves the information.
[2015-01-30 08:15:41] WhereIsMySpoon: brooksch: I dont actually do file download with selenium at all
[2015-01-30 08:16:02] WhereIsMySpoon: i use a http response checker class to inspect the headers returned
[2015-01-30 08:16:17] WhereIsMySpoon: that way a) im not dealing with files and b) its quicker
[2015-01-30 08:17:22] brooksch: I'm doing this to automate downloading after a particularly painful signing procedure
[2015-01-30 08:17:50] brooksch: Normally I would curl it up
[2015-01-30 08:17:56] brooksch: But the sign in procedure is somewhat interactive, and selenium is a nice solution.  I just can't find a way to autodownload the files.
[2015-01-30 08:18:21] WhereIsMySpoon: sure, i do all the sign in and moving pages with selenium
[2015-01-30 08:18:35] WhereIsMySpoon: when it comes time to press the 'download' button, i just send a http request instead
[2015-01-30 08:18:38] WhereIsMySpoon: via the javascriptexecutor
[2015-01-30 08:19:00] brooksch: Hrm, I was using browser.get()
[2015-01-30 08:19:03] WhereIsMySpoon: it will download the file as a side effect but i dont even deal with it
[2015-01-30 08:19:07] brooksch: With the filedownload url

[2015-01-30 08:20:00] brooksch: Do you just feed a url to the javascriptexecutor
[2015-01-30 08:20:09] brooksch: or ajaz?
[2015-01-30 08:20:11] brooksch: ajax?
[2015-01-30 08:20:29] jarib: brooksch: perhaps you can write a webdriver script that dumps about:config, wait for you to manually change the preference to "always save" and dump about:config again
[2015-01-30 08:20:44] jarib: then diff the output to see what the correct preference is now
[2015-01-30 08:20:52] WhereIsMySpoon: brooksch: document.location.hostname
[2015-01-30 08:21:08] WhereIsMySpoon: i just set the url to that
[2015-01-30 08:21:24] brooksch: jarib, I've scoured my main profile, which downloads automatically, and there seems to be nothing in there about saving to disk.  I'm thinking firefox moved this out of about:config
[2015-01-30 08:21:28] WhereIsMySpoon: wait no i dont sorry
[2015-01-30 08:21:40] shri, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-30 08:21:51] WhereIsMySpoon: i get the document.location.hostname, plus the url I want to add onto it, and use HttpClient in java to execute a request
[2015-01-30 08:21:58] jarib: brooksch: if you have the actual url, you can just use the cookies from selenium with your favorite http lib
[2015-01-30 08:22:10] WhereIsMySpoon: ^ pretty much what im doing
[2015-01-30 08:22:32] WhereIsMySpoon: httpbuilder/httpclient/httpresponse
[2015-01-30 08:22:49] brooksch: Ok, this seems pretty good.  So move download out of selenium into my native code (which is python, but that's fine it's similar enough)
[2015-01-30 08:23:02] WhereIsMySpoon: yer
[2015-01-30 08:23:05] brooksch: This seems like a good solution
[2015-01-30 08:23:15] brooksch: Thanks folks, I appreciate it
[2015-01-30 08:23:21] WhereIsMySpoon: brooksch: this doesnt apply to you particularly
[2015-01-30 08:23:47] WhereIsMySpoon: but in general for downloads/uploads, you want to avoid dealing with the actual file -> browser interaction, as then you're just testing whether the browser can download and upload
[2015-01-30 08:23:52] WhereIsMySpoon: which is pointless
[2015-01-30 08:23:56] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2015-01-30 08:23:59] brooksch: Right
[2015-01-30 08:24:06] WhereIsMySpoon: thats why for uploads you just modify the <input type="file"
[2015-01-30 08:24:10] brooksch: Here I'm not trying to test but more to automate a workflow
[2015-01-30 08:24:20] WhereIsMySpoon: and for downloads this native http thing is better imo
[2015-01-30 08:24:22] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2015-01-30 08:24:37] brooksch: Yes, I should be able to set directories and stuff nicely, and deal with permissions well

[2015-01-30 11:18:18] dude-x: well it's javascript...
[2015-01-30 11:18:27] dude-x: it's going to log in as a user, no password
[2015-01-30 11:18:34] dude-x: and then return the user object as a json
[2015-01-30 11:19:30] dude-x: in general executeAsyncScript will run code that depends on a call back;
[2015-01-30 11:20:01] extor: How does Awsomium differ from Selenium in a practical, application relevent way? Let's say I want to automate the registration and login process into 10 random websites. Some of which use JS and what not. Perhaps even flash? With which tool can I build an app faster?
[2015-01-30 11:20:26] dmarr: ok thanks dude-x that kind of makes sense
[2015-01-30 11:21:29] dude-x: dmarr: webdriverJS has a different way of writing scripts due to the heavy use of async
[2015-01-30 11:21:57] dude-x: extor: selenium dosn't work handle flash, never heard of awsomium
[2015-01-30 11:22:00] dude-x: but it's not a good name

[2015-01-30 12:03:30] dude-x: it doesn't do anything special other than inject some javascript code that allows the browser to talk to the code binding
[2015-01-30 12:03:42] dude-x: on Firefox, it installs a webdriver plugin

[2015-01-30 12:03:57] dude-x: Chrome uses an intermediate ChromeDriver program

[2015-01-30 12:06:24] dude-x: but it was not a trivial task and they put constraints on what they want to work with
[2015-01-30 12:07:05] extor: dude-x I thought Selenium was used for heavy duty testing of websites and that would involve logging in adn logging out and clearing cookies and such very rapidly? Isn't that what it was built for? Stress testing web servers?
[2015-01-30 12:07:40] dude-x: it is for automated testing and automated interaction
[2015-01-30 12:07:50] dude-x: but there are limits

[2015-01-30 16:04:02] jugglinmike: None. I'm invoking as: `java -jar {{ path_to_jar_file }}`
[2015-01-30 16:05:05] dude-x: in that manner, you can not run it headless
[2015-01-30 16:05:16] jugglinmike: oh!
[2015-01-30 16:05:34] dude-x: if you connect to it, it will spawn a browser, and that will require a framebuffer
[2015-01-30 16:06:03] jugglinmike: dude-x: I have that part taken care of. I've install Xvfb and I have set the DISPLAY env var as appropriate

[2015-01-30 16:07:10] dude-x: if you just run the jar

[2015-01-30 16:10:20] jugglinmike: the standard startup text is printed to standard out
[2015-01-30 16:10:23] dude-x: yeah
[2015-01-30 16:10:24] jugglinmike: but nothing after that
[2015-01-30 16:10:35] jugglinmike: when I'm making requests
[2015-01-30 16:10:51] jugglinmike: although I wouldn't expect that
[2015-01-30 16:11:00] jugglinmike: because I am running the same test on my host machine
[2015-01-30 16:11:13] jugglinmike: which has a display, and where everything works
[2015-01-30 16:11:14] dude-x: then if you connect via python, for example, driver = webdriver.Remote({'browser': 'firefox'}, 'http://127.0.0.1/wd/hub'})
[2015-01-30 16:11:34] emperorcezar, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2015-01-30 16:11:47] dude-x: then you should get a message from the client if something goes wrong, and in the stdout of the running server
[2015-01-30 16:12:29] jugglinmike: I think trying to connecting via a language binding is taking a step backward. I'm using `curl` because that proves the server isn't responding to any http requests
[2015-01-30 16:12:58] dude-x: i'm not sure using curl alone will work
[2015-01-30 16:13:00] jugglinmike: (plus, my testing infrastructure won't allow me to run tests against a selenium server it can't "see" via a GET request)
[2015-01-30 16:13:07] jugglinmike: it does on my host machine
[2015-01-30 16:13:09] dude-x: okay
[2015-01-30 16:13:51] jugglinmike: GETting localhost:4444 there results in a 403
[2015-01-30 16:14:09] chrismcmahon, quitting. ()
[2015-01-30 16:14:18] dude-x: and it doens't on the other host?
[2015-01-30 16:14:21] dude-x: then i don't know....
[2015-01-30 16:14:38] dude-x: things that have affected the server are IP addresses
[2015-01-30 16:14:42] jugglinmike: whereas inside this virtual machine, curl exits with an error, "couldn't connect to host"
[2015-01-30 16:14:46] dude-x: you may want to bind a particular IP address
[2015-01-30 16:14:57] dude-x: yeah that could be it
[2015-01-30 16:15:09] dude-x: find out the thing to set an ip address
[2015-01-30 16:15:27] dude-x: VMs tend to have a bridge IP
[2015-01-30 16:15:42] dude-x: the server might wrongly bind to that, so you may have to specify it yourself

[2015-01-30 16:18:20] dude-x: it might --host 127.0.0.1 or --ip; i forget
[2015-01-30 16:18:27] jugglinmike: -host
[2015-01-30 16:18:55] dude-x: yeah

[2015-01-30 16:19:07] dude-x: it's time for me to go home
