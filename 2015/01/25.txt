[2015-01-25 01:09:46] kbarry: I'm trying to learn how to use Grid. I'm fairly new to Selenium itself, but am trying to get into it. I am picking thru existing code, and trying to see what might need to be changed to test using grid.
[2015-01-25 01:09:47] kbarry: We currently have tests written in ruby.
[2015-01-25 01:10:25] kbarry: I have read, and seen that there is a slight different setup needed to get the tests to run remotely.
[2015-01-25 01:11:29] kbarry: Some of our test files have many different tests defined inside. Will we be able to set things so that these tests might be run in parallel across the grid?
[2015-01-25 01:11:35] twilight, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-25 01:12:25] kbarry: The documentation re: grid makes me think we are going to need to put in some special 'foo', stating that "this test is to be run in firefox", etc.

[2015-01-25 01:28:37] shteou_: kbarry: Yeah, so normally you would create a Driver instance (FirefoxDriver/IEDriver etc.)
[2015-01-25 01:28:55] shteou_: but instead you'll create a RemoteWebDriver instance and pass it the capabilities you want (e.g. Capabilities.Firefox)
[2015-01-25 01:29:12] kbarry: shteou_: I see a ':remote', as in
[2015-01-25 01:29:20] shteou_: Yeah, that'd be it
[2015-01-25 01:29:34] kbarry: Selenium::WebDriver.for(:remote, :url => DEFAULT_REMOTE_URL, :desired_capabilities => caps)
[2015-01-25 01:29:42] shteou_: That looks correct yeah
[2015-01-25 01:29:52] shteou_: But the issue of running tests in parallel
[2015-01-25 01:30:09] shteou_: is you're really limited by your testing framework / setup
[2015-01-25 01:30:42] kbarry: What do you mean?
[2015-01-25 01:30:44] shteou_: Most tools are designed to run things sequentially, so you can either find something which runs in parallel, hack your own or take your existing sequential tests and run them some other way
[2015-01-25 01:31:13] shteou_: e.g. I wrote a parallel test runner at my last job, but at this one I will be batching the different form factors
[2015-01-25 01:31:26] kbarry: You mean, "get to a page, now do these tests (There might be 5), then go to another page, and do these tests.
[2015-01-25 01:31:35] kbarry: and each test might now have the "foo" to "go to this page"
[2015-01-25 01:31:46] shteou_: kbarry: So say I have 5 tests, all of which are capable of running on their own
[2015-01-25 01:32:05] shteou_: if I just write cucumber my.feature it will move run test 1 through 5 sequentially
[2015-01-25 01:32:19] shteou_: grid won't help you there
[2015-01-25 01:32:40] shteou_: But if you wanted to run the same 5 tests in two different browsers, you could run cucumber twice
[2015-01-25 01:32:46] kbarry: (i'm guessing cucumber is not the antecedent of the pickel
[2015-01-25 01:33:28] shteou_: hehe, cucumber does utilise a language called Gherkin :p
[2015-01-25 01:33:33] kbarry: (i'm still an uber newb, and so 2 things, First, thanks for the help, and also thanks for the patience.
[2015-01-25 01:33:59] kbarry: Look, grid might not be right for me as far as parallel, it dos, however, solve an important issue,
[2015-01-25 01:34:28] kbarry: Which is that before i joined the team, testing has been done on each persons laptop.
[2015-01-25 01:34:32] shteou_: kbarry: Yeah, it can be used just to divvy up tests to the correct machines :)
[2015-01-25 01:34:46] shteou_: Anyway, I'll be back on later if you want a chat, in a few hours
[2015-01-25 01:34:55] kbarry: You leaving for now?
[2015-01-25 01:34:58] shteou_: I do very similar things, Ruby/WebDriver
[2015-01-25 01:35:08] shteou_: Yeah, I have a meeting in 25 mins
[2015-01-25 01:35:34] shteou_: It's somewhere on a farm, I think
