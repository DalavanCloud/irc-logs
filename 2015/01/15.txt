[2015-01-15 14:12:48] TrentonDAdams: I'm curious about why selenium seems to be moving more towards a programmatic testing framework, as opposed to a more declarative one.  e.g. You write code to test, rather than declare what to do, such as in XML, or config files.
[2015-01-15 14:13:28] lukeis: selenium is a tool, not a framework :)
[2015-01-15 14:13:35] lukeis: tool / Library
[2015-01-15 14:13:44] TrentonDAdams: okay, sure.
[2015-01-15 14:14:03] lukeis: you can certainly use a framework to use selenium in a declarative way
[2015-01-15 14:14:22] TrentonDAdams: Specifically?
[2015-01-15 14:14:51] lukeis: cucumber is something that comes to mind
[2015-01-15 14:14:57] lukeis: http://cukes.info/
[2015-01-15 14:17:59] TrentonDAdams: Okay, but I guess the question is why would selenium itself not be delcarative?  For example, ultimately, the selenium IDE files, while kind of a clunky format, were easy to change, share, etc.
[2015-01-15 14:18:31] TrentonDAdams: I would have kind of thought it would be nicer to have a file format that was the same between unit tests, and the IDE.  So that you could just run the files no matter which you're using
[2015-01-15 14:18:56] TrentonDAdams: We have users, that would like to use selenium IDE, but developers that would like to do automated UI unit testing.
[2015-01-15 14:19:24] jleyba: Itâ€™s certainly possible to build that
[2015-01-15 14:19:28] TrentonDAdams: Not being able to share the IDE markup between them is double the work.
[2015-01-15 14:20:34] TrentonDAdams: jleyba: Right, but I used to be able to just do that.  I used to copy the selenium code into perl format, for example, and run the tests.  Ultimately though, the test language should have a driver that could just read a selenium IDE file, and run it.

[2015-01-15 22:24:30] rodyhaddad: How I know this: I have a 'document.body.innerHTML = "It works";' in my page, and when I output the html of my page to my terminal, my served <body> is still there instead of "It works"
[2015-01-15 22:25:37] rodyhaddad: Would anyone where I should start investigating to find what the issue is? Is it in the way I'm running selenium (just running the jar)? The way firefox is setup (just apt-get installed it)? or the driver I'm using?
