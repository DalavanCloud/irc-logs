[2015-01-06 06:22:16] ato: I don't know why the Java API would explicitly add a method to get that, but.

[2015-01-06 09:09:26] dude-x: or even a .rb
[2015-01-06 09:09:34] dude-x: that says browser=firefox
[2015-01-06 09:09:57] dude-x: then your test code will have a function that will read the config file and initialize the right type of driver
