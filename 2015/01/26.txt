[2015-01-26 06:38:23] ccmonster: it is
[2015-01-26 06:39:40] sburjan, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2015-01-26 06:39:48] jimevans: okay, next question. what's happening when you try to run the code that you've pasted? does it find the element in question?
[2015-01-26 06:40:42] ccmonster: It finds the element, #content, but it can't seem to read the text
[2015-01-26 06:41:50] jimevans: how do you mean "can't seem to read" it? does it return an empty string? i'm not familiar with python's unittest library, so i don't know if it tells you what the actual value is when you call the assert methods, and the values don't match.
[2015-01-26 06:42:08] jimevans: also, what happens if you wait between finding the element and getting the text attribute?
[2015-01-26 06:42:13] ccmonster: by default, the text is basically "   \n   ", but "Event is Not Active" is dynamically added. It ALWAYS finds the empty string essentially
[2015-01-26 06:42:37] jimevans: (i notice in your code that you do a find_element…().text all in one line.
[2015-01-26 06:43:03] ccmonster: when i open the dev console and inspect the element, I can see the "   \n Event is not active" however.
[2015-01-26 06:43:11] jimevans: what happens if you (temporarily and only for testing purposes) manually insert a sleep between the find and getting the text?
[2015-01-26 06:43:16] ccmonster: yes, is that not advised?
[2015-01-26 06:43:31] jimevans: in a case like this, you may have a race condition that you're losing.
[2015-01-26 06:43:51] ccmonster: hmm.
[2015-01-26 06:44:17] jimevans: if, as you say, the element has its content dynamically generated, it's entirely possible that the element exists, with no content, and you're attempting to get the text before the javascript has had a chance to execute and update the text.
[2015-01-26 06:44:20] ccmonster: does selenium grab the text everytime you do a .text, or does it capture the text at the time of finding the element?
[2015-01-26 06:44:42] jimevans: it does it when the .text attribute is accessed.
[2015-01-26 06:44:56] jimevans: and doesn't (or shouldn't) cache the value.
[2015-01-26 06:45:18] ccmonster: so if i debug live, everytime i call .text it should re-access the text attry
[2015-01-26 06:45:28] jimevans: should do.
[2015-01-26 06:45:42] jimevans: notice, i said *should*
[2015-01-26 06:46:07] jimevans: you mentioned using phantomjs. do you see any difference running with a different browser?
[2015-01-26 06:48:36] ccmonster: i seem to be running into all sorts of issues with firefox, and in this case, headless is preferred anyway.
[2015-01-26 06:49:16] ccmonster: <div id="content" role="main" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="false" relevant="additions" style="height: 638px;">
[2015-01-26 06:49:16] ccmonster: 	<br>Event is not active</div>
[2015-01-26 06:49:19] ccmonster: jimevans: in the web inspector, the element looks like so ^
[2015-01-26 06:49:20] jimevans: i understand the preference, but this is where i point out that no user will ever browse the site using a headless browser.
[2015-01-26 06:49:51] ccmonster: yes, but the point is to determine the closed captioning piece, not the full browsing experience.
[2015-01-26 06:50:00] jimevans: ccmonster: fine. i honestly don't care what it looks like in the inspector. the inspector won't be subject to the same race condition that your webdriver code will be.
[2015-01-26 06:50:21] ccmonster: understand. Just putting more context to the situation.
[2015-01-26 06:50:59] jimevans: so my question still stands. what happens when you put a pause between finding the element and getting its text? does webdriver then find the text value in the element?
[2015-01-26 06:51:31] ccmonster: im live inspecting right now, trying .text repeadetly, nothing yet. I will try a timed/programmatic wait. one moment.

[2015-01-26 06:53:30] jimevans: does the page content refresh? if so, you could still be in a race condition.
[2015-01-26 06:54:20] ccmonster: the page does refresh.
[2015-01-26 06:54:53] jimevans: yeah, you're going to be in a world of hurt trying to fight with the page, unless you can disable the refreshes.
[2015-01-26 06:55:27] jimevans: because when the page reloads, the element you found with find_element_by… will be stale.
[2015-01-26 06:55:48] sebhoss, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-26 06:56:03] ccmonster: yea.
[2015-01-26 06:56:06] ccmonster: i assumed as much.
[2015-01-26 06:57:49] jimevans: you're masking that problem in your code by always calling find_element, but if the browser hasn't had time to have its content updated by the executing javascript, you've lost the race condition.
[2015-01-26 06:59:26] jimevans: but until and unless you can specifically put in a delay (at least for testing purposes) between finding the element and getting its text, i'm not prepared to say this is a webdriver or even a browser problem.
[2015-01-26 07:00:08] ccmonster: ok
[2015-01-26 07:00:17] ccmonster: perhaps I'm able to find the perfect timing.
[2015-01-26 07:05:15] jimevans: i sincerely wish you luck with that.

[2015-01-26 07:39:11] _Druid_: how can i see list of active sessions on webdriver.Remote(), by python api?
[2015-01-26 07:45:53] ato: _Druid_: You need to keep track of sessions yourself, or query the server you're interacting with.
[2015-01-26 07:48:56] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-26 07:54:56] _Druid_: i can see current auto-generated session name , like 'fa977e9c-e596-49db-b62d-19527d717cd5', by driver.capabilities.items()
[2015-01-26 07:55:54] nirvdrum, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-01-26 07:56:05] _Druid_: but how can i set custom session name, and how can i set custom session connection? driver = webdriver.Remote( something like target_session=mycustom/or random session name
[2015-01-26 07:59:15] jimevans: _Druid_: what are you actually trying to accomplish? (i think i already know, but i want to hear you say it)
[2015-01-26 08:00:41] _Druid_: i try to start one session like go to google.com, and after to disconnect from webdriver.Remote, and connect again to same session and execute something like search query :)
[2015-01-26 08:01:11] Dave_B_: http://media.giphy.com/media/wfdzAgbvsK7Mk/giphy.gif
[2015-01-26 08:01:13] jimevans: yeah, i figured it was something like that. "user wants to attach to an existing, running browser session."
[2015-01-26 08:01:26] _Druid_: xD
[2015-01-26 08:02:01] _Druid_: yes, is possible this? sorry for my bad english...
[2015-01-26 08:02:17] jimevans: man goes to the doctor, and raises his arm, and tells the doctor, "it hurts when i do that, doc." doctor replies, "don't do that, then."
[2015-01-26 08:02:55] jimevans: attempting to connect to an existing session is a fool's errand.
[2015-01-26 08:03:20] _Druid_: why?
[2015-01-26 08:04:16] jimevans: because webdriver sessions *require* the browser to have been started by webdriver. to reuse an existing session requires abandoning an existing session in mid-operation, which is subject to all sorts of leakage.
[2015-01-26 08:06:26] _Druid_: i see on /wd/hub/static/resource/hub.html , all sessions not closed with driver.close(), so i guess i can interact again with this sessions,no?\
[2015-01-26 08:07:01] jimevans: until the timeout for unclosed sessions kicks in and drops the session while you're trying to connect to it, sure. :)
[2015-01-26 08:07:15] _Druid_: good, how can i do this?
[2015-01-26 08:07:29] _Druid_: to connect to custom session listed in /wd/hub/static/resource/hub.html?

[2015-01-26 08:11:14] Dave_B_: to turn your question around… Why would you have disconnected from a session that you still needed?
[2015-01-26 08:11:15] jimevans: nothing's wrong with me. i've offered my best advice as a core contributor to the project, which you've chosen to ignore, and pursue other avenues. i have other things i need to attend to.

[2015-01-26 08:16:19] jimevans: why on earth would you use a web browser to check email?
[2015-01-26 08:16:30] jimevans: (from an automated work flow)
[2015-01-26 08:17:19] _Druid_: that's my scenario
[2015-01-26 08:17:29] Dave_B_: Are you testing the games site, or your email provider?
[2015-01-26 08:17:39] _Druid_: you're funny guys :)
[2015-01-26 08:17:56] _Druid_: you want to know what i do , or to tell me if is possible to continue googleing mby..
[2015-01-26 08:18:43] jimevans: but checking the email via a web browser is one of the absolute least reliable ways to do that. if the goal is to check the email to get the get the confirmation code, use a mail client from your code to do that. i assume python has a pop3 and/or imap library that can be used to check an email inbox.
[2015-01-26 08:19:23] _Druid_: jimevans: i know this, is just an example to see if is possible to use this in this way
[2015-01-26 08:19:24] Dave_B_: _Druid_: I strongly suggest listening to jim, it's a much better way of dealing with the problem
[2015-01-26 08:19:29] Dave_B_: however...
[2015-01-26 08:19:44] Dave_B_: if you insist on that kind of workflow, you can do stuff like: https://gist.github.com/daveberg/72f62a267dc5999fcf7a
[2015-01-26 08:20:10] _Druid_: but i guess .. i need to start multiple driver = webdriver.Remote( , for every sesssion, and keep all alive
[2015-01-26 08:20:10] Dave_B_: note, this then depends on how long you take doing other stuff and makes your whole flow more fragile
[2015-01-26 08:20:51] Dave_B_: you could hack around it to achieve this
[2015-01-26 08:20:56] Dave_B_: but I don't recomment it

[2015-01-26 19:49:52] CSWookie: Hey all, I'm using webdriver with python bindings.  I'd like to browse to a non-HTML file and get its source.  I tried do page_source of the page, but it threw some HTML around the data.
[2015-01-26 19:50:16] CSWookie: Is there a way to not have that happen?
[2015-01-26 19:55:12] dude-x: CSWookie:
[2015-01-26 19:55:13] dude-x: no
[2015-01-26 19:55:23] dude-x: just remove the pre tags
[2015-01-26 19:55:46] CSWookie: Bummer.

[2015-01-26 19:59:55] CSWookie: I can do that, I suppose.  Is adding the html something Selenium is doing, or something the browser is doing?
[2015-01-26 20:02:27] wilhelm_: The browser.
[2015-01-26 20:03:38] CSWookie: I figured as much.

[2015-01-26 20:13:53] dude-x: CSWookie: you can probably do something like get_element_by_css_selector('pre').text

[2015-01-26 22:34:32] koomi_: i've started to use the c# bindings to run selenium tests with powershell.
[2015-01-26 22:35:01] koomi_: right now i'm in the middle of writing convenience functons to abstract away some of the c# to get a more powershell'y feeling
[2015-01-26 22:35:23] koomi_: i was wondering if there are some test pages i can run my code against to see if it works
[2015-01-26 22:35:29] koomi_: (and get some unit testing done?)
