[2013-05-09 06:42:01] seljenkinsbot: Project Chrome Linux Java Tests build #2628: FIXED in 6 min 35 sec: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Chrome%20Linux%20Java%20Tests/2628/
[2013-05-09 06:42:50] dawagner: Well that's an annoying fix.
[2013-05-09 06:43:19] dawagner: jcraft's ssh library, when you have a connection, you have a channel and a session
[2013-05-09 06:43:41] dawagner: Turns out, if you disconnect the session, it tries to disconnect the channel, and fails horribly if, say, you've already disconnected the channel
[2013-05-09 06:44:10] dawagner: Which is why our builds were timing out and failing.  Because it would go "Time to shut down.  OH WAIT I WILL JUST SIT HERE FAILING FOR A WHILE"

[2013-05-09 06:50:11] dawagner: I found the name a little confusing
[2013-05-09 06:50:17] dawagner: Can you sum up the intention of what it's for?
[2013-05-09 06:50:29] Ardesco: dammit you were supposed to say yes I am and I would have switched you into positive mode and me into negative
[2013-05-09 06:50:34] Ardesco: now we are both stuck in negative
[2013-05-09 06:51:07] Ardesco: dawagner: the intention is to provide a list of @FindBy annotations
[2013-05-09 06:51:43] Ardesco: it will then return a list of WebElements that match all the @FindBy annotations specified
[2013-05-09 06:51:45] dawagner: And to return which of: {the first, all} elements which match {any, all} bys?
[2013-05-09 06:52:51] jimevans: okay, so if i'm using the interactions api (action chains), and i do a mouse move action, with an element specified, but no offset, and the center of the element cannot be scrolled into view because the element is too big, where should the mouse move? for webelement.click(), we said we should click in the center of the visible portion of the element after scrolling as much into view as possible.

[2013-05-09 07:35:21] barancev: imho, page factory can be removed from the selenium distrinution at all, may be even as a separate project
[2013-05-09 07:35:27] jimevans: then let's quit supplying anything in the support namespace altogether. no webdriverwait, no select element wrapper, no page factory, no nothing.
[2013-05-09 07:35:31] chrismcmahon: jimevans: is the code that runs the IEDriver tests for setting cookies on Sauce public somewhere?  I failed to find the magic incantation (in Ruby) to set the ignoreProtectedModeSettings capability to true, and documentation is scarce.
[2013-05-09 07:36:03] Ardesco: oki dawagner
[2013-05-09 07:36:20] barancev: webdriverwait and select are language neutral things that can be implemented in all bindings
[2013-05-09 07:36:48] jimevans: chrismcmahon: all of the code is part of the repo.
[2013-05-09 07:37:11] jimevans: and please, for the love of all that's holy, don't set ignoreProtectedModeSettings to true.

[2013-05-09 11:38:12] gdennis: lukeis: it may be helpful to add a simple ExpectedCondition.asBoolean helper function that interprets any value as a primitive boolean (i.e. return value != null && value != Boolean.FALSE). Then it's easier to reason about boolean logic once you have the primitive. You could build ExpectedCondition.and, .or, and others from it easily. The bug in not() probably would not have been made if it used a helper function like that.
[2013-05-09 11:39:33] lukeis: i see… i quite like that actually, maybe in my next spare moments I'll put that together :)

[2013-05-09 13:28:18] Dude-X: Ardesco_Home: i was looking at your wait for jquery code to complete. what does window.jquery keep track of?

[2013-05-09 13:29:09] Ardesco_Home: i'm guessing you mean the part that checks that jquery is loaded

[2013-05-09 13:30:07] Dude-X: yes
[2013-05-09 13:30:23] trent_, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-09 13:30:25] Ardesco_Home: that's checking jQuery is loaded before requesting the number of active AJAX connections
[2013-05-09 13:31:07] Ardesco_Home: without it I was occasionally getting an error where the jQuery.active request was sent before jQuery had been loaded into the page
[2013-05-09 13:31:15] Dude-X: ah neat
[2013-05-09 13:31:22] Dude-X: i've had that problem before
[2013-05-09 13:31:23] Ardesco_Home: so it waits until the jQuery object exists and then waits for 0 AJAX calls to be in porcess
[2013-05-09 13:31:29] Ardesco_Home: *process
[2013-05-09 13:31:55] Dude-X: normally i'd wait for some other element before i did the jquery.active checks
[2013-05-09 13:32:24] Dude-X: however animated widgets controlled by jquery rely on other things
[2013-05-09 13:32:48] Ardesco_Home: can be a real pain in the arse at tiems :)
[2013-05-09 13:33:14] Dude-X: using filter(:animated) === 0 works
[2013-05-09 13:33:20] Dude-X: as your predicate
[2013-05-09 13:33:51] Ardesco_Home: have to give that a go at some point
[2013-05-09 13:34:00] dimacus: Dude-X:  why not wait for jQuery to finish animating?
[2013-05-09 13:34:05] dimacus: then do rest of the checks?
[2013-05-09 13:34:16] Dude-X: only problem is the race condition where a click may set something into motion but the animation doesn't start yet
[2013-05-09 13:34:26] Dude-X: and the check succeeds...
[2013-05-09 13:34:33] dimacus: '$(":animated").length'
[2013-05-09 13:34:49] dimacus: fare enough.. what are the odds though?
[2013-05-09 13:35:08] Dude-X: i've had the occasional flakiness from that…. :/
