[2013-05-06 07:26:52] klepikovm: hi, QQ... how to upload a patch for review? I end up with an issue that cannot show side by side diffs: https://codereview.appspot.com/9223043/
[2013-05-06 07:27:11] klepikovm: I do:
[2013-05-06 07:27:11] klepikovm: ./upload.py --download_base --base_url=https://code.google.com/p/selenium/ --rev=remotes/origin/master
[2013-05-06 07:28:23] barancev: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium -- you can create a pull request
[2013-05-06 07:28:44] klepikovm: what if I'm already in git based on code.google.com?
[2013-05-06 07:28:58] klepikovm: is the only way redoing the whole thing off of github?
[2013-05-06 07:30:11] cmcgraw, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-06 07:30:41] barancev: googlecode unfortunately does not provide a good way to send a patch to review
[2013-05-06 07:31:40] klepikovm: ok 2nd Q -- the real one:) I added a new test class under java/test/o/o/s/logging
[2013-05-06 07:32:12] klepikovm: and it doesn't run when I do ./go test_chrome offline=true haltonerror=false haltonfailure=false log=true onlyrun=<my class>
[2013-05-06 07:32:12] barancev: if you want to use googlecode only you can add a comment with the abovementioned link to codereview, and after review you should create a patch file and attach it to the issue
[2013-05-06 07:32:22] klepikovm: it works with an existing class like GetLogsTest
[2013-05-06 07:33:00] barancev: a new test should be added to one of the existing test suites
[2013-05-06 07:33:08] klepikovm: and my class is in tests.jar
[2013-05-06 07:33:19] klepikovm: where is the suite def?
[2013-05-06 07:34:07] klepikovm: ah found StandardSeleniumTests

[2013-05-06 07:48:59] Xapak: How do you guys handle Firefox new input fields validation? I mean, I handled validation on my application, and that’s what I tested with Selenium, but with Firefox giving me not-on-DOM tooltips, my Selenium steps don’t finish.
[2013-05-06 07:49:02] Ardesco_Home: jump in shout and jump out agian
[2013-05-06 07:49:09] Xapak: Firefox 19+ I think.
[2013-05-06 07:49:10] barancev: I'm going to make grid "beta" console the default one, any objections?
[2013-05-06 07:49:35] Ardesco_Home: by not on dom tooltips do you mean a title attribute ?
[2013-05-06 07:50:06] plightbo, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-06 07:50:28] Xapak: No, it displays a Firefox-owned tooltip for instance, if the input field had “required” but it was left empty.
[2013-05-06 07:50:48] barancev: ah, HTML5 fields
[2013-05-06 07:51:13] Ardesco_Home: Is there an example page available that shows what you mean?
[2013-05-06 07:51:27] Xapak: Hmm, not publicly available. :'(
[2013-05-06 07:51:31] Ardesco_Home: although if it's firefox specific functionality i would question the value of testing it
[2013-05-06 07:51:43] Dude-X: HTML5 fields, i change the type so that the browser doesn't interfere
[2013-05-06 07:51:48] Ardesco_Home: can you show the markup for that element?
[2013-05-06 07:52:14] Dude-X: type="email" is annoying because the browser, not the app will state that the email is not proper, or requiered
[2013-05-06 07:52:56] Ardesco_Home: OK, so is there a real requirement to check that FireFox does what FireFox thinks it should do
[2013-05-06 07:53:06] Ardesco_Home: this is outside the control of your site by the sound of it
[2013-05-06 07:53:14] Xapak: Let’s say I have these input fields, with HTML5 “required” attribute. I leave one of them empty. The application I’m testing validates just that, that the value is valid, or at least is not left blank, but Firefox now hijacks that with its own tooltips about “Please fill this field”, and I can’t test those.
[2013-05-06 07:53:25] Ardesco_Home: and if FireFox didn't behave as expected there doesn't sound like a huge amount you could do
[2013-05-06 07:53:31] barancev: wtf! https://gist.github.com/barancev/5525645 -- why a node registers itself on the hub and reports all slots as VISTA except for IE that is WINDOWS?
[2013-05-06 07:53:44] Xapak: What I’m saying is that I’m not able to supress that to verify my application actually validates de information.
[2013-05-06 07:53:44] Ardesco_Home: I would validate that the correct type attribute had been set and leave it at that
[2013-05-06 07:54:00] Ardesco_Home: ah
[2013-05-06 07:54:59] Xapak: I just don’t want to make my tests browser/version specific, not just for this. (foreveralone)
[2013-05-06 07:55:09] Ardesco_Home: in that case I would look for a way to disable the validation in firefox
[2013-05-06 07:55:14] Ardesco_Home: I assume there must be a way

[2013-05-06 07:57:43] Xapak: Yeah, I am breaking my head. At first tests would fail on the virtual appliances, then when I tried local, I realized why.
[2013-05-06 07:59:33] Xapak: For instance, Firefox thinks “myaccount@email” is fine, which my application obviously detects as invalid.

[2013-05-06 13:32:01] llaskin1: yea i think 90 is a 400$ a night hotel
[2013-05-06 13:32:14] cgoldberg: i wouldn't pay my own money.,.. but a company wouldnt freak over a marriot
[2013-05-06 13:32:16] freynaud: cgoldberg: how far is it from the conf ? can you walk from there ?
[2013-05-06 13:32:29] llaskin1: yea u can
[2013-05-06 13:32:40] llaskin1: warning: there is not much to do near the conf
[2013-05-06 13:32:53] llaskin1: the speakers dinner is actually in the north end(will require a cab)
[2013-05-06 13:32:54] freynaud: surely there is a bar of some sort
[2013-05-06 13:32:59] llaskin1: the party is closer to the conf
[2013-05-06 13:33:33] cgoldberg: you can take a $5-7 cab ride and your at fannuel hall.. plenty to do if you venture out a little

[2013-05-06 13:37:03] Dude-X: i am paying 189 dollars a night
[2013-05-06 13:37:08] Dude-X: good thing my  company pays for it
[2013-05-06 13:37:10] Phasze: cgoldberg: probably have to cab across the Fort Point Channel anyway right?
[2013-05-06 13:37:32] Phasze: if from 90 or marriot
[2013-05-06 13:37:55] cgoldberg: Phasze, you can walk it
[2013-05-06 13:37:59] cgoldberg: the bridge..

[2013-05-06 13:39:19] llaskin1: just fyi: anything in East Boston, avoid.

[2013-05-06 13:40:17] llaskin1: i mean...u can always stay *at* the airport
[2013-05-06 13:40:24] llaskin1: not super fun/near fun things, but probably cheaper

[2013-05-06 14:53:22] asavchuk: jimevans: hm. then another timeout? or hardcode something like 1seconds ?
[2013-05-06 14:54:04] barancev: I used to sleep for 200ms, that was enough
[2013-05-06 14:54:41] barancev: so I think we can set hardcoded timeout 1s

[2013-05-06 14:54:58] jimevans: asavchuk: i'd probably hard-code it to start (retry for one second, on 50 millisecond intervals). if that's not long enough for other cases, maybe we can create a timeout settable by capability. but i wouldn't expose the capability until and unless there's a documented need forit.
[2013-05-06 14:55:04] jimevans: s/forit/for it/
[2013-05-06 14:55:47] barancev: 10 attempts with 100ms interval would be reasonable strategy imho
[2013-05-06 14:56:01] asavchuk: jimevans: barancev: good. N iterations with sleep interval.
[2013-05-06 14:56:03] asavchuk: ok
