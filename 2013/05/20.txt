[2013-05-20 07:30:41] jimevans: Ardesco: just wanted to follow up on the IEDriverServer change from fridayh.
[2013-05-20 07:31:17] Ardesco: so i rolled back to 2.32.0 and it's still failing the same way, I've now rolled back to 2.31.0 which is where it originally was on friday
[2013-05-20 07:31:38] Ardesco: and it's just passed
[2013-05-20 07:31:50] Ardesco: so i'm not sure what's going on with our env
[2013-05-20 07:32:11] jimevans: okay, well that means that whatever i've been changing over the last week isn't what broke stuff.
[2013-05-20 07:32:15] Ardesco: latest in git is giving the same results as the current live release
[2013-05-20 07:32:22] Ardesco: yup
[2013-05-20 07:32:48] Ardesco: I'm just scratching my head trying to work out what the issue is with our test framework right now

[2013-05-20 07:34:29] jimevans: i've got one more change i need to push, but the important changes for requireWindowFocus took effect in 2.32.3.11.
[2013-05-20 07:34:45] jimevans: (latest in git is 2.32.3.12)
[2013-05-20 07:34:59] jimevans: soon to be 2.32.3.13
[2013-05-20 07:36:10] Ardesco: not a good day today, our application won't deploy on the windows box I put together today
[2013-05-20 07:36:18] Ardesco: so i can't run it locally atm
[2013-05-20 07:36:22] jimevans: yeesh. sounds like.
[2013-05-20 07:36:43] Ardesco: if i get it sorted i'll grab the latest from git and try again
[2013-05-20 07:36:49] Ardesco: or rather when
[2013-05-20 07:36:49] jimevans: thanks mate.
[2013-05-20 07:36:55] Ardesco: i'm going to have to get it sorted
[2013-05-20 07:36:58] Ardesco: :)

[2013-05-20 07:48:17] barancev: simonstewart: you reverted my synchronization schema again, do you have a better idea?
[2013-05-20 07:48:34] simonstewart: Yes. I implemented it
[2013-05-20 07:48:55] simonstewart: If you want to futz with it, you MUST NOT change NewProfileExtensionConnection
[2013-05-20 07:49:15] simonstewart: A "Lock" implementation is the thing that's respsonsible for understanding how to obtain a lock
[2013-05-20 07:49:26] simonstewart: Spreading that logic through the codebase is a Bad Thing.
[2013-05-20 07:49:37] barancev: I expect your implementation does not work
[2013-05-20 07:49:42] simonstewart: I expect it does
[2013-05-20 07:49:49] simonstewart: The syncObject is a singleton in the JVM
[2013-05-20 07:50:00] simonstewart: And we sycnhronize on that before getting the socket lock
[2013-05-20 07:50:26] simonstewart: Which is basically what you were doing before --- even using the same sync object --- but in a single class
[2013-05-20 07:50:31] barancev: you're trying to synchronize port selection only
[2013-05-20 07:50:40] simonstewart: No.
[2013-05-20 07:51:14] simonstewart: The Lock is wrapped around the critical period of Firefox startup
[2013-05-20 07:51:30] simonstewart: From picking the port to use right up to the port actually being used by firefox
[2013-05-20 07:51:46] barancev: exactly, but we have to synchronize __both__ lock and unlock in the same sync block
[2013-05-20 07:51:52] simonstewart: And they are
[2013-05-20 07:52:11] simonstewart: Effectively
[2013-05-20 07:52:53] barancev: ok, what happens if you want to start 20 FFxes simultaneousely?
[2013-05-20 07:52:58] simonstewart: If you were really paranoid you'd implement DCL by setting a boolean in lock and unsetting it in unlcok
[2013-05-20 07:53:19] simonstewart: Only one instance gets the sync lock, then gets the socket lock
[2013-05-20 07:53:24] simonstewart: the others block on the socket lock
[2013-05-20 07:53:33] barancev: each FF takes ~10sec to start
[2013-05-20 07:53:47] simonstewart: Then set a boolean in the SocketLock
[2013-05-20 07:54:19] barancev: well, theory aside, let me run a test :)
[2013-05-20 07:54:20] simonstewart: If you're starting that many instances per machine, you should probably implement your own port allocation strategy and lock mechanism
[2013-05-20 07:54:49] simonstewart: And if it's taking that long to start a firefox instance, you're in a bad palce
[2013-05-20 07:55:57] simonstewart: You may see timeouts because we start the timer before we have the synched object
[2013-05-20 07:56:03] ryanpetrello, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-20 07:57:52] jimevans: if i wanted to locally set the requireWindowFocus capability in the IE driver via command line using the go build script, can i do that? if so, how? if not, where do i modify the java tests to set that capability?
[2013-05-20 07:57:53] barancev: yes, exactly! why do we start the timer before we have got the syncked object?
[2013-05-20 07:58:40] barancev: it's "start timeout", not "wait others timeout"
[2013-05-20 07:59:36] Ardesco: grrr
[2013-05-20 07:59:44] Ardesco: user env variable instead of a system one
[2013-05-20 07:59:46] *jimevans can't seem to follow the myriad WebDriverBuilder, Supplier<?>, other classes '
[2013-05-20 07:59:47] Ardesco: damn you windows
[2013-05-20 08:00:01] barancev: jimevans: org.openqa.selenium.testing.drivers.LocallyBuiltInternetExplorerDriver
[2013-05-20 08:01:10] simonstewart: barancev: the timeout is global IMO. I want my test to fail if I've not obtained a firefox instance within 45 secdonds, regardless of what's causing the delay
[2013-05-20 08:01:42] barancev: so we need two different timeouts
[2013-05-20 08:02:03] barancev: "connection timeout" and "waiting in queue timeout"
[2013-05-20 08:02:06] seljenkinsbot: Project Chrome Linux Java Tests build #2663: UNSTABLE in 22 min: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Chrome%20Linux%20Java%20Tests/2663/
[2013-05-20 08:02:25] simonstewart: no
[2013-05-20 08:02:43] simonstewart: you need a diffeent port allocation and locking strategy
[2013-05-20 08:02:56] simonstewart: The standard one isn't a great fit for the overloaded machine you have
[2013-05-20 08:03:05] simonstewart: So rather than muck around with it, write a new one
[2013-05-20 08:03:13] barancev: so let's make it more robust
[2013-05-20 08:03:27] barancev: it does not affect fast envs
[2013-05-20 08:03:35] barancev: and helps slow ones
[2013-05-20 08:04:11] simonstewart: Your slow env is an outlier
[2013-05-20 08:04:55] simonstewart: The only reason we need to do the locking in the first place is because we don't want to coordinate port allocation centrally
[2013-05-20 08:04:57] barancev: my? look into the tracker and user group how many people cry on "Unable to bind to locking port 7054"
[2013-05-20 08:05:18] simonstewart: Given our user numbers, it's not that many
[2013-05-20 08:05:34] barancev: how can it affect "fast" users?
[2013-05-20 08:05:45] simonstewart: ?
[2013-05-20 08:05:46] jimevans: barancev: you sure about that? i see in LocallyBuiltInternetExplorerDriver where i can set properties on the service, but this is a capability of the driver.
[2013-05-20 08:06:44] barancev: jimevans: it is the driver, it is instantiated in org.openqa.selenium.testing.drivers.TestInternetExplorerSupplier
[2013-05-20 08:07:45] barancev: simonstewart: if we add more robust synchronization with additional "please wait in the queue" timeout -- how can it affect existing fast envs?
[2013-05-20 08:08:12] simonstewart: barancev: I don't really care how the locking is done, but it MUST be contained in a Lock implementation
[2013-05-20 08:08:21] simonstewart: It MUST NOT be smeared throughout the codebase
[2013-05-20 08:08:30] jimevans: barancev: and where are those capabilities specified? in both of the classes you've mentioned, we're passed in a Capabilities interface, which is not mutable.
[2013-05-20 08:08:44] simonstewart: The changes to NewProfileConnectionExtension are the reason I keep on backing out your change
[2013-05-20 08:08:47] simonstewart: and will continue to do so
[2013-05-20 08:09:50] plightbo, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-20 08:09:55] barancev: jimevans: org.openqa.selenium.testing.drivers.WebDriverBuilder prepares capabilities, selects a driver supplier and request it to instantiate a driver
[2013-05-20 08:11:23] barancev: simonstewart: ok, I got your point, will try to implement it without touching NewProfileConnectionExtension
[2013-05-20 08:11:29] simonstewart: Thanks :)
[2013-05-20 08:11:45] jimevans: apparently, i'm not asking my question with sufficient clarity. but never mind. i think i can hack what i need by changing webdriverbuilder.
[2013-05-20 08:12:03] jimevans: err, BrowserToCapabilities, rather.
[2013-05-20 08:12:21] Ardesco: jimevans: I've run with the latest version of the iedriver from git (2.32.3.12) and one failure i'm getting is triggering a hover event
[2013-05-20 08:12:27] barancev: I suspect may be I just need to move timer start into the synchronization block
[2013-05-20 08:12:34] simonstewart: The key property you're looking for is that obtaining the lock should only return when the next instance can continue
[2013-05-20 08:12:36] Ardesco: looks like after a file upload focus isn't on IE any more
[2013-05-20 08:12:42] simonstewart: barancev: maybe
[2013-05-20 08:12:46] Ardesco: if I wiggle the mouse it fixes it though
[2013-05-20 08:13:05] jimevans: Ardesco: well, that's something.
[2013-05-20 08:13:18] jimevans: i'll have to investigate that.
[2013-05-20 08:13:39] jimevans: i'm messing with sendKeys right now.
[2013-05-20 08:14:11] plightbo, quitting. (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[2013-05-20 08:14:17] Ardesco: not sure why IE9 is blowing up, i'm pretty sure it's our IE9 box though
[2013-05-20 08:14:26] barancev: simonstewart: how do you feel about two different timeouts if both will be hidden inside Lock?
[2013-05-20 08:14:41] simonstewart: I feel a little bit unwell
[2013-05-20 08:15:06] jimevans: Ardesco: keep me apprised. :)
[2013-05-20 08:15:17] Ardesco: will do
[2013-05-20 08:15:19] barancev: one can't get all 20 browsers in 45 seconds :)
[2013-05-20 08:15:44] simonstewart: barancev: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Semaphore.html might be useful
[2013-05-20 08:15:47] barancev: even if hardware is good enough, browser start is slow
[2013-05-20 08:16:03] simonstewart: barancev: 20 browsers in 45 seconds? You can if you move the socket allocation out of selenium
[2013-05-20 08:16:07] barancev: especially if you have no SSD
[2013-05-20 08:16:15] simonstewart: No SSD? Ugh
[2013-05-20 08:16:26] barancev: temp profile creation is slow
[2013-05-20 08:16:47] simonstewart: krosenvold____ probably had a machine that can do it :)

[2013-05-20 08:18:14] Ardesco: jimevans do you know if there were ny dependency changes between 2.31 and 2.32?  e.g. .NET version or anything like that
[2013-05-20 08:18:27] Ardesco: IEDriverServer.exe seems to be crashing on the IE9 box
[2013-05-20 08:18:47] Ardesco: can't get into the damn thing to pull out detailed logs though
[2013-05-20 08:19:04] jimevans: Ardesco: no dependency changes, no. logging also shouldn't be affected.
[2013-05-20 08:19:21] jimevans: can you get any information about where it's crashing?
[2013-05-20 08:19:30] jimevans: s/where/when in the process/
[2013-05-20 08:20:42] Ardesco: all i have atm are the jenkins logs
[2013-05-20 08:20:51] barancev: simonstewart: with two timeouts we can treat separately "inability to start a browser in 45 sec" (due to startup problems -- wrong path, broken profile, etc) and "inability to obtain lock in 5 min" (e.g. due to overloading the hardware)
[2013-05-20 08:21:05] jimevans: ick. need to set the log level on the server.
[2013-05-20 08:21:15] Ardesco: Caused by: java.io.IOException: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host
[2013-05-20 08:21:18] simonstewart: barancev: just look at the semaphore and move the timing to inside the block where the semaphore is acquired
[2013-05-20 08:21:20] Ardesco: which isn't really helpful
[2013-05-20 08:21:31] wolcanus, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-05-20 08:21:47] jimevans: Ardesco: yeah, need to set the log level and log file on the driver service.
[2013-05-20 08:21:48] nirvdrum, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-05-20 08:21:50] Ardesco: i'll get our friendly neighbourhood devops onto it and pull out what information i can
[2013-05-20 08:22:02] Ardesco: i suspect we have something wrong with the build though
[2013-05-20 08:22:06] jimevans: InternetExplorerDriverService.Builder is your friend. :)
[2013-05-20 08:22:14] barancev: simonstewart: I'm trying to explain the idea of __two__ timeouts :)
[2013-05-20 08:22:20] Ardesco: just strange that rolling it back to 2.31.0 gets it all up and running again
[2013-05-20 08:22:27] Ardesco: I'm sure theres a logical explanation
[2013-05-20 08:22:50] simonstewart: barancev: I'm trying to explain that I find the idea of two timeouts distasteful
[2013-05-20 08:22:58] jimevans: is it 2.32.0.0 of the iedriverserver that causes the problem?
[2013-05-20 08:23:50] barancev: moving the timing into a semaphore implicitly makes "wating in the queue" infinite
[2013-05-20 08:24:07] Ardesco: i tried 2.32.3 today
[2013-05-20 08:24:13] barancev: that's not good either
[2013-05-20 08:24:34] simonstewart: And I'm okay with that because (once again, for effect): "if you're in a place where you're trying to start 20 firefox simultaneously, you should implement your own locking and port allocation strategies"
[2013-05-20 08:24:37] barancev: but it was infinite in my previous implementation, tbh
[2013-05-20 08:24:51] Ardesco: anyway let me get more info, i'm not giving you anything useful at all atm
[2013-05-20 08:25:05] nirvdrum, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-20 08:25:05] Ardesco: and the fact it's running fine on IE8 and on a local IE10 says it's the box
[2013-05-20 08:25:15] Ardesco: or something we have done to it
[2013-05-20 08:25:24] jimevans: Ardesco: let's also start using the fourth field of the version as well for IEDriverServer.exe.
[2013-05-20 08:25:36] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-20 08:26:19] jimevans: pulling from code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list is 2.32.3.0. latest in the git repository is 2.32.3.12 (soon to be .13)
[2013-05-20 08:26:50] lukeis: :ci
[2013-05-20 08:26:50] selbot2__: Jenkins: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/ | Dashboard: http://dashboard.ci.seleniumhq.org/
[2013-05-20 08:26:56] Ardesco: in that case 2.32.3.0 i tried earlier and 2.32.3.12 is what i'm using locally right now
[2013-05-20 08:27:09] jimevans: okay. great.
[2013-05-20 08:28:06] jimevans: that helps too.
[2013-05-20 08:29:02] wolcanus, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-20 08:29:06] lukeis: barancev: did we ever flip the bit to have sauce auto-recreate a VM when the browser fails to start?
[2013-05-20 08:29:29] barancev: lukeis: yes
[2013-05-20 08:29:37] Ardesco: I rolled it back to 2.31.0.0 to fix the issues we are having
[2013-05-20 08:29:46] barancev: lukeis: not the browser, but a server
[2013-05-20 08:29:56] lukeis: ah
[2013-05-20 08:30:27] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-20 08:33:04] jimevans: Ardesco: so there are certainly some possibilities for what changed between 2.31.0.0 and 2.32.0.0 that *might* cause instability. *.1.0, *.2.0, and *.3.0 are all pretty minor updates.
[2013-05-20 08:33:58] lukeis: do we know why this test is failing in IE? org.openqa.selenium.TypingTest.testFunctionKeys
[2013-05-20 08:34:00] jimevans: (just looking at the changelog)
[2013-05-20 08:34:08] jimevans: lukeis: yep. know exactly.
[2013-05-20 08:34:10] Oscar1, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-05-20 08:34:12] lukeis: ok ;)
[2013-05-20 08:34:16] jimevans: and it's expected.
[2013-05-20 08:34:37] lukeis: just going through ci and making sure our test failures are expected ;)
[2013-05-20 08:34:39] jimevans: we turned on requireWindowFocus for sauce executions.
[2013-05-20 08:34:50] jimevans: which broke some of the IE6 tests.
[2013-05-20 08:34:56] jimevans: and i'm looking at right onw.
[2013-05-20 08:34:57] jimevans: now even
[2013-05-20 08:35:08] davehunt, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-05-20 08:35:32] Ardesco: well my problems with our IE9 box aside, i'm not seeing any issues with requireWindowFocus locally with 2.32.3.12
[2013-05-20 08:35:41] Ardesco: which is the question originally asked :)
[2013-05-20 08:36:10] Ardesco: looks good in IE8 too apart from needing to add a jiggle to one step of one of our tests
[2013-05-20 08:36:22] jimevans: the function keys test types F4, which for IE puts the focus in the address bar. when using SendInput (which is what requireWindowFocus does), we don't (and can't) check during sending of a key sequence that focus is correct. they just get blindly sent to wherever the focus happens to be.
[2013-05-20 08:37:30] jimevans: which means "KEYS-TOO" gets sent to the browser address bar.
