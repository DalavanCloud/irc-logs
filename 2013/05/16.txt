[2013-05-16 03:42:42] barancev: disabled two recently added tests :)
[2013-05-16 03:43:31] barancev: one is related to RTL languages, another is related to passing maps to executeJavascript
[2013-05-16 03:43:53] andreastt: Sounds good.
[2013-05-16 03:44:15] andreastt: As you may have guessed, we're really busy right now with the new browser.
[2013-05-16 03:44:25] andreastt: So not really any time to fix Presto issues.
[2013-05-16 03:44:52] AutomatedTester: Hypothetical: if you were keynoting PyCon what would you talk about?
[2013-05-16 03:45:41] andreastt: Something other than Python. d-:
[2013-05-16 03:47:55] AutomatedTester: thats the 2nd such suggestion
[2013-05-16 03:48:17] andreastt: Sorry, I have a love-hate relationship towards it.
[2013-05-16 03:48:41] AutomatedTester: andreastt: but thats because it feels like you are doing things that are pythonic
[2013-05-16 03:48:47] AutomatedTester: but I have suggested this before
[2013-05-16 03:49:02] AutomatedTester: arent pythonic
[2013-05-16 03:49:10] andreastt: Hm, not really.  Most of my annoyances are tiny little platform and library incompatibilities.
[2013-05-16 03:49:20] andreastt: And that the standard library could do with a good spring cleaning.
[2013-05-16 03:49:30] AutomatedTester: andreastt: a lot like Java
[2013-05-16 03:49:56] plightbo, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-16 03:50:14] andreastt: But I don't dislike the language as such.
[2013-05-16 03:50:33] andreastt: Besides, almost everything I do these days is in Python.
[2013-05-16 03:50:41] barancev: I dislike python for python 2-to-3 switch
[2013-05-16 03:51:01] AutomatedTester: barancev: python people hate that too
[2013-05-16 03:51:18] AutomatedTester: supporting both versions is a PITA
[2013-05-16 03:52:37] andreastt: I like __future__ though.
[2013-05-16 03:52:59] andreastt: But I don't want to know what abominations hide inside that library.
[2013-05-16 03:53:05] AutomatedTester: well you arent supposed to use __future__ often
[2013-05-16 03:53:08] andreastt: I'm happily using it blindly (-:
[2013-05-16 03:53:21] AutomatedTester: future is to help with multiple version support
[2013-05-16 03:53:34] AutomatedTester: but if you use it all the time then its probably best to upgrade
[2013-05-16 03:54:02] AutomatedTester: says he who still has to support 2.4
[2013-05-16 03:54:12] AutomatedTester: *cries a little*
[2013-05-16 03:54:24] andreastt: Well, Python 3 has a much more sane import path logic than 2.
[2013-05-16 03:54:34] andreastt: Which is my primary use case.
[2013-05-16 03:54:51] AutomatedTester: so why not move everything to 3?
[2013-05-16 03:54:54] andreastt: We've upgraded everything to 2.7 now, so I'm not too unhappy.
[2013-05-16 03:55:01] andreastt: 2.7 support.
[2013-05-16 03:55:06] AutomatedTester: needed for?

[2013-05-16 03:56:46] andreastt: We will eventually get to 3.
[2013-05-16 03:57:07] andreastt: The automation tools were running 2.6 until very recently.

We are starting the skript check_selnium several times after each other. But mostly after the dirt time we got the error: timed out after 30000ms. If we wait a few minutes and check again everything is working fine again, but only once within a few minutes. Did anyone know where is the problem?

[2013-05-16 06:23:10] DerManni: Ok, did you seen this error on an regularly selenium installation? Independent from my installation?
[2013-05-16 06:23:10] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: no
[2013-05-16 06:23:37] AutomatedTester: DerManni: firefox_profile works fine from the core lib
[2013-05-16 06:24:06] AutomatedTester: DerManni: we have tests that access that library
[2013-05-16 06:24:13] DerManni: Sry ardesco, the autocomplete did that ;-)
[2013-05-16 06:24:38] Ardesco: eh?
[2013-05-16 06:24:42] *Ardesco looks confused'
[2013-05-16 06:25:27] DerManni: No my comment "ok, so" wasn't finished at this time, but I hit enter
[2013-05-16 06:26:51] Ardesco: ah, I was talking to AutomatedTester  at that point
[2013-05-16 06:27:12] DerManni: @Automatedtester: this was the original post:
[2013-05-16 06:27:25] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: no, someone has written a patch to keep profiles between sessions
[2013-05-16 06:27:31] DerManni: Hello guys. We experienced a strange problem using headless selenium with xvfb and iceweasel on an debian 6. We are starting the skript check_selnium several times after each other. But mostly after the dirt time we got the error: timed out after 30000ms. If we wait a few minutes and check again everything is working fine again, but only once within a few minutes. Did anyone know where is the problem

[2013-05-16 06:28:12] Ardesco: that doesn't sound like a good idea
[2013-05-16 06:28:24] AutomatedTester: I need to have the Firefox profile and all changes that are made to it during a Seleniumsession preserved between sessions.
[2013-05-16 06:28:29] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: ^
[2013-05-16 06:28:37] AutomatedTester: that means they want their tests to not be clean
[2013-05-16 06:28:57] Ardesco: also if they want to do that they could just run their tests in the same browser
[2013-05-16 06:29:03] Ardesco: without closing it down
[2013-05-16 06:29:15] Ardesco: sounds like they have tests depending on tests which is a smell in my mind

[2013-05-16 06:30:38] DerManni: We do a simple login, check for an phrase and logout. This test should be executed every 10 minutes. The browser should be closed after each test
[2013-05-16 06:30:39] AutomatedTester: agreed
[2013-05-16 06:31:05] AutomatedTester: DerManni: thanks for the message but you havent answered my question
[2013-05-16 06:31:08] AutomatedTester: what is the error?
[2013-05-16 06:31:27] AutomatedTester: "it's flaky" isnt something I can help with
[2013-05-16 06:32:37] DerManni: The Error: Exception: Timed out after 30000ms
[2013-05-16 06:34:35] DerManni: In front of this there are some selenium.py errors: File...selenium.py, line xxx, in open or File....selenium.py, line xxx, in.do_command

[2013-05-16 10:34:22] jimevans: Ardesco_Home: you're one of the few people i know of consistently using requireWindowFocus for the IE driver.
[2013-05-16 10:34:46] jimevans: we just turned it on for the CI build for IE, which exposed an issue with sendKeys
[2013-05-16 10:35:22] jimevans: i may have a fix for it, but i'm not entirely convinced of its efficacy. just wanted to give you a heads-up
[2013-05-16 10:35:24] Ardesco_Home: hmm i've not seen any
[2013-05-16 10:35:43] Ardesco_Home: our builds are rocks solid stable atm
[2013-05-16 10:35:55] Ardesco_Home: have to check what version i'm using
[2013-05-16 10:37:03] jimevans: no, the issue is definitely there. when you use sendKeys with requireWindowFocus, the SendInput API shoves the keystrokes into the keyboard input queue, but that doesn't mean they've been processed by IE's message pump yet. if your machine is sufficiently slow, the keystrokes may not get fully entered into the element by the time you expect them to be.
[2013-05-16 10:37:37] Ardesco_Home: maybe it's the speed of the machines we use then
[2013-05-16 10:37:45] Ardesco_Home: we are using EC2 Large instances for IE tests
[2013-05-16 10:38:07] jimevans: if you look at our CI results, you can clearly see the issue cropping up.
[2013-05-16 10:38:09] Ardesco_Home: got to try and speed up that IE JavaScritp engine somehow :)
[2013-05-16 10:38:26] jimevans: yeah, i'll get right on that. :)
[2013-05-16 10:38:27] Ardesco_Home: maybe that's why we have had limited success running our tests on Sauce
[2013-05-16 10:38:46] jimevans: could be.
[2013-05-16 10:39:07] Ardesco_Home: ah we are on 2.31.0 of IEDriverServer.exe
[2013-05-16 10:39:21] Ardesco_Home: something that came in in 2.23 maybe ?
[2013-05-16 10:39:25] jimevans: shouldn't matter, really. it's all about processing power.
[2013-05-16 10:39:28] Ardesco_Home: 2.32 even
[2013-05-16 10:39:35] jimevans: this issue has been there since requireWindowFocus was introduced.
[2013-05-16 10:40:12] Ardesco_Home: I guess it's one of those "Hoe the hell did this ever work??" moments :)
[2013-05-16 10:40:15] Ardesco_Home: *How
[2013-05-16 10:40:17] SamuraiJack, joining. (#selenium)

[2013-05-16 10:40:47] Ardesco_Home: I'm thinking about our tests
[2013-05-16 10:41:09] jimevans: and the keystrokes *will* show up, just not necessarily before your next step happens.
[2013-05-16 10:41:11] Ardesco_Home: everybody is runnign macbooks at work so our IE tests have always been run through CI using EC2 instances

[2013-05-16 10:42:22] Ardesco_Home: ok
[2013-05-16 10:42:24] jimevans: 2.32.3.11 is the latest.
[2013-05-16 10:42:47] Ardesco_Home: Well i'm happy to try adding it into our framework as soon as it's there
[2013-05-16 10:42:57] Ardesco_Home: and see how that affects our tests (if at all)
[2013-05-16 10:43:29] jimevans: the issue only appears in the requireWindowFocus case, so not many people have hit it/will hit it.
[2013-05-16 10:43:44] jimevans: but i know you've been using it, so i thought i'd give you a heads up.
[2013-05-16 10:43:53] Ardesco_Home: cheers :)
[2013-05-16 10:44:04] Ardesco_Home: yup it's hard coded into our test framework
[2013-05-16 10:44:11] Ardesco_Home: all the IE tests we run use it
[2013-05-16 10:44:12] jimevans: and to help make sure my fix (if i get it right) doesn't break anything. :)

[2013-05-16 11:03:41] imphasing: I've got selenium grid open locally and the browserTimeout set to 5 minutes so I can play with the session while any random test is sitting on a breakpoint.. if I navigate to the localhost:4444/wd/hub/session/GUID/url URL, I can see the command is executed on the node's output, but my browser never recieves a response.. just sits "waiting for localhost" when I request that URL

[2013-05-16 11:08:37] jimevans: Megido: so you'll need to synchronize before calling driver.quit. that is, you'll need to look for some element that appears after a successful upload.

[2013-05-16 12:37:01] AutomatedTester: intchanter-work: one suggestion today was talk about how awful python developers are at testing

[2013-05-16 16:14:42] dogarrhea: downloads are part of the web
[2013-05-16 16:15:01] llaskin: dogarrhea: we spend tons of money for that marketing
[2013-05-16 16:15:02] llaskin: as you know
[2013-05-16 16:15:16] barancev|2: yes, yes, and you return again and again and continue using fucking selenium, why?
[2013-05-16 16:15:32] dogarrhea: because you've managed to fool some retards who believe it's hot shit
[2013-05-16 16:15:33] llaskin: barancev|2:  i'll have a talk with our marketing peeps
[2013-05-16 16:15:37] llaskin: so that they stop advertising to dogarrhea
[2013-05-16 16:15:49] llaskin: i'd lol if dogarrhea turned out to be FSET or somesuch
[2013-05-16 16:15:58] barancev|2: no, it can't be you this retard
[2013-05-16 16:16:17] dogarrhea: try qualcomm
[2013-05-16 16:16:22] barancev|2: why you do bought this marketing shit and use selenium?
[2013-05-16 16:16:29] dogarrhea: they hired a team of 30 h1b outsourced selenium developers
[2013-05-16 16:16:37] dogarrhea: as of 1 year and 3 months ago
[2013-05-16 16:16:48] dogarrhea: now they have just 1 selenium developer as a last ditch effort to "automate"
[2013-05-16 16:17:20] barancev|2: so what?
[2013-05-16 16:17:34] dogarrhea: there's this app on grails for their internal patent management application that their fucking lawyers and stakeholders use
[2013-05-16 16:17:36] plightbo, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-16 16:17:46] dogarrhea: so they download spreadsheets and stuff
[2013-05-16 16:17:54] dogarrhea: but nooo. now we need to do autoit
[2013-05-16 16:18:02] dogarrhea: beause selenium is incomplete.
[2013-05-16 16:18:13] dogarrhea: i can just write c++ windows api programs to automate things..
[2013-05-16 16:18:29] dogarrhea: why bring in all these integration headaches
[2013-05-16 16:19:15] barancev|2: exactly, you do need to use autoit, go use it! or write your own tool in c++, a good ideaoo. why do you continue fighting with selenium? drop it, now
[2013-05-16 16:19:45] dogarrhea: if you need food on the table you will fight for whatever.
[2013-05-16 16:19:56] dogarrhea: despite the morons on top who bought into selenium
[2013-05-16 16:20:13] barancev|2: do you obliged to use it?
[2013-05-16 16:20:31] barancev|2: can't you go tell you boss selenium is shit?
[2013-05-16 16:20:32] dogarrhea: "do you obliged to use it"

[2013-05-16 16:31:13] llaskin: then you probably suck at it
[2013-05-16 16:31:46] dogarrhea: it's selenium fail. i now need to jna or jni or execute some command line script because no, downloads aren't part of the web
[2013-05-16 16:32:03] dogarrhea: and selenium only likes firefox driver
[2013-05-16 16:32:50] dogarrhea: i have not recommended testing anything on phone browsers with selenium.
[2013-05-16 16:32:56] dogarrhea: because it's just so broken there
[2013-05-16 16:33:07] barancev|2: we know :)
[2013-05-16 16:33:41] barancev|2: we hoped somebody like you come here and implement a working driver for mobile oses :)

[2013-05-16 16:36:02] barancev|2: I usually use another way to download files, not described in this article -- I use browsermob-proxy that performs download and sends a simple notification page with the link to the downloaded file to the browser

[2013-05-16 16:36:20] llaskin: barancev|2: thats one way to do it too:)
[2013-05-16 16:38:08] barancev|2: it's crossplatform, crossbrowser, no native dialog windows
[2013-05-16 16:38:25] llaskin: dogarrhea: hows that solution for you?
[2013-05-16 16:38:36] dogarrhea: not done reading it
[2013-05-16 16:38:44] llaskin: well then why don't you read it
[2013-05-16 16:38:52] llaskin: and in the mean time, go fuck yourself?
[2013-05-16 16:39:12] dogarrhea: nope
[2013-05-16 16:39:33] dogarrhea: for something so simple, this "workaround" seems pretty screwed up. time waster
[2013-05-16 16:39:53] dogarrhea: AND it's not simulating user experience anymore
[2013-05-16 16:40:13] llaskin: dogarrhea: well then i suggest QTP
[2013-05-16 16:40:18] dogarrhea: which is the whole point of selenium in the first place. to simulate how that lawyer who approves patent 349283492834928394 uses the app
[2013-05-16 16:40:19] barancev|2: it's not so simple because every browser implements its own download dialog
[2013-05-16 16:40:38] barancev|2: that may vary among versions
[2013-05-16 16:40:47] barancev|2: and IE9+ has no dialog at all
[2013-05-16 16:41:03] barancev|2: instead there is a "panel" in the bottom of the window
[2013-05-16 16:41:19] barancev|2: that no automation tool can recognize as a "widget"

[2013-05-16 16:43:51] llaskin: and they are different in every OS
