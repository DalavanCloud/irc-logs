[2013-05-28 00:29:09] barneyS: barancev: have they fixed this issue in 2.33?
[2013-05-28 00:29:52] barancev: I suggest to check this. yes, some fixes in autoscrolling are present in almost every release
[2013-05-28 00:30:55] barneyS: yes, i'll do that
[2013-05-28 00:30:57] barancev: it is is not fixed -- please provide a sample page or an URL to a pege where it can be reproduced
[2013-05-28 00:31:26] barneyS: i dnt think you'l be able to reproduce, it's a production code
[2013-05-28 00:32:12] barneyS: basically its a survey question, which i'm answering.. the options are <a> tags with different id's. . .
[2013-05-28 00:32:36] barneyS: it runs fine for few starting questions, but later on after few question it gives this error
[2013-05-28 00:32:44] Manoj: right, barneyS the purpose of providing the link is so that you will take a look on that and you could provide us the reproducible test with sample html page.

[2013-05-28 00:39:23] barancev: 3) element has negative coordinates

[2013-05-28 02:58:22] ronny: AutomatedTester: wrong is the formatting of exceptions (because much of the data in the formated trace is unreadable
[2013-05-28 02:58:47] AutomatedTester: can I see an example
[2013-05-28 02:58:53] ronny: patching out the repr in self.msg before inserting it made it already more nice
[2013-05-28 02:59:17] ronny: AutomatedTester: stuff like StaleElement has huge json items in the msg,
[2013-05-28 02:59:57] *AutomatedTester goes looking in the code to see what you mean since asking you isnt helping'
[2013-05-28 03:00:03] ronny: i.e. not just 2 params like unable to locate, but 3 lines of not pretty printed json on a terminal that has >100 characters lines
[2013-05-28 03:00:27] zac_sel: I've never seen that in a StaleElement ? Are you doing something different to get extra debugging output?
[2013-05-28 03:00:48] ronny: let me paste a example
[2013-05-28 03:01:15] AutomatedTester: thank you
[2013-05-28 03:01:18] PierreW: i am to stupid to get an Actions instance on a WebDriverBackedSelenium in java and to find good google result for a solution. Any hints?
[2013-05-28 03:01:56] AutomatedTester: PierreW: dont use WebDriverBackedSelenium unless you really have to
[2013-05-28 03:02:30] PierreW: okay :) i'm totally new to using java for selenium. thanks for the hint. :)
[2013-05-28 03:02:35] ronny: AutomatedTester: the code in question is https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/py/selenium/common/exceptions.py#23
[2013-05-28 03:02:43] ronny: plus whatever formats msg before its passed
[2013-05-28 03:02:49] AutomatedTester: PierreW: just use webdriver
[2013-05-28 03:03:08] AutomatedTester: ronny: ok, so what is in the JSON blob that is useful?
[2013-05-28 03:03:25] plightbo, quitting. (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[2013-05-28 03:03:56] ronny: and example output is www.bpaste.net/show/rHosn4Qx60VpA4INq2kX/
[2013-05-28 03:05:02] ronny: AutomatedTester: btw, i already removed the call to repr for self.msg in selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException.__str__
[2013-05-28 03:05:23] ronny: (because with the u"...\nmore" the error display is even worse
[2013-05-28 03:05:42] AutomatedTester: ronny: what information is it missing
[2013-05-28 03:05:56] AutomatedTester: ronny: since there is a lot of information that isnt required to the end user
[2013-05-28 03:06:20] ronny: AutomatedTester: i have no idea, it just throws that blob at me and its damn hard to figure anything, since i really just started with selenium
[2013-05-28 03:06:50] AutomatedTester: ronny: ok but you are calling it crap and you dont understand what you want so its hard to help you
[2013-05-28 03:06:59] AutomatedTester: a lot of the information is not required
[2013-05-28 03:07:09] AutomatedTester: its useful to me for debugging and thats it
[2013-05-28 03:07:46] ronny: AutomatedTester: yes, why is it there in a blob thats formated in a way that is very hard to interpret, in parituclat for selenium beginners
[2013-05-28 03:07:55] AutomatedTester: if you do driver.find_element(By.ID, "#form_profilepublic') and you get a NoSuchElementException its fairly obvious what the error is, no?
[2013-05-28 03:08:10] PierreW: :)
[2013-05-28 03:08:42] ronny: AutomatedTester: yes, but i know the element is there and want to fiugre what it did search where so it didnt find it
[2013-05-28 03:09:13] ronny: and its like "oh, lots of data, what is actually usefull"
[2013-05-28 03:09:29] AutomatedTester: like what?
[2013-05-28 03:09:49] AutomatedTester: this the crux of the conversation
[2013-05-28 03:09:54] ronny: do i look like i have a idea, i just have a large serialized as not prettyprinted string json blob
[2013-05-28 03:09:57] AutomatedTester: what do you find is valueable in there
[2013-05-28 03:10:09] cuauhtemoc, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-05-28 03:10:25] ronny: and i have NO idea what valuable, but i do know that a large blob of json data thats not prettyprinted is absolutely horrible to read
[2013-05-28 03:10:44] ronny: sowhy is it not prettyprinted
[2013-05-28 03:11:09] cuauhtemoc, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-28 03:11:13] AutomatedTester: to save on output
[2013-05-28 03:11:53] ronny: why is it necessary to safe on output? if those things pass out of a test, i want to read nicely wahts wrong
[2013-05-28 03:11:58] ronny: atm i cant do that
[2013-05-28 03:12:00] ronny: why?
[2013-05-28 03:12:20] AutomatedTester: because its there to have a look when I am debugging
[2013-05-28 03:12:34] AutomatedTester: when developing you should be writing deterministic code
[2013-05-28 03:12:51] AutomatedTester: if you are not writing deterministic code then you are going to hit errors because its doing random things
[2013-05-28 03:13:07] AutomatedTester: and the first thing you are going to do is blame the library you are using
[2013-05-28 03:13:08] ronny: weill, im refactoring testing tools, they break and now i need to read that stuff and its a pain
[2013-05-28 03:13:41] AutomatedTester: as I said, if you do driver.find_element(By.ID, "#form_profilepublic') and you get a NoSuchElementException its fairly obvious what the error is, no?
[2013-05-28 03:14:27] ronny: i also had the same errors with various css selectors, and its not always oblivious
[2013-05-28 03:14:38] ronny: plus you asume im using driver direclyly
[2013-05-28 03:15:24] AutomatedTester: ronny: even if you arent using it directly, the backtrace will have the line where webdriver raises an exception
[2013-05-28 03:16:11] ronny: yes
[2013-05-28 03:16:51] AutomatedTester: so at the top of the trace you have NoSuchElementException and at the bottom of the trace you have driver.find_element(By.ID, "#form_profilepublic')
[2013-05-28 03:16:52] ronny: which is in some cases happening in a some_element.find_element_by_css_selector
[2013-05-28 03:18:30] ronny: AutomatedTester: the crux is now i need to figure where did it start to search from, what did it search
[2013-05-28 03:18:49] AutomatedTester: ronny: right, and the exception wont tell you that
[2013-05-28 03:19:17] AutomatedTester: if you do element.find_element*(....) it will search from that element onwards through the DOM
[2013-05-28 03:19:21] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-28 03:19:50] ronny: so i gotta handle it by intercepting and raising eceptions that do contain the correct information about what was searched and where
[2013-05-28 03:20:14] ronny: is it necessary to always show the blob then?
[2013-05-28 03:21:18] AutomatedTester: ronny: for debugging purposes for me yes
[2013-05-28 03:21:31] AutomatedTester: and for anyone who wants to work on the Selenium code base
[2013-05-28 03:21:50] ronny: AutomatedTester: but why show those to all selenium users that just run their tests
[2013-05-28 03:22:14] AutomatedTester: ronny: because I havent added an IF DEBUG type wrapper to things
[2013-05-28 03:22:14] ronny: basically those things can fall trough every time a page is changed or a test is changed
[2013-05-28 03:22:21] AutomatedTester: and I dont see value in adding it either
[2013-05-28 03:22:52] AutomatedTester: ronny: yes they can and this is why good abstraction on top of webdriver can save you maintenace effort
[2013-05-28 03:23:46] ronny: ok
[2013-05-28 03:24:20] ronny: AutomatedTester: btw, please still remove the call to repr for self.msg in WebDriverException.__str__
[2013-05-28 03:24:34] AutomatedTester: why?
[2013-05-28 03:25:06] ronny: then isntead of u"text\ndebug stuff" i get text<real new line here>debug stuff
[2013-05-28 03:26:26] AutomatedTester: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s63/sh/8efa3792-6ebe-4d7b-80af-e19e20f2fa87/e289c03f9517e32d66fdb0af8866bae2 looks pretty to me
[2013-05-28 03:27:42] ronny: oO firefox declares that image is broken :(
[2013-05-28 03:29:04] ronny: so i cant see what you mean
[2013-05-28 03:29:30] ronny: AutomatedTester: but bascially a repr call replaces newlines with a literal r'\n'
[2013-05-28 03:30:01] ronny: since well, a repr for python unicode can be eval'd

[2013-05-28 04:17:39] Ardesco: so if you are telling me that the id in question is a descendant, that sounds like an issue

[2013-05-28 05:12:46] AutomatedTester: I dont use django-selenium though
[2013-05-28 05:13:09] chiller: django-selenium is a runner and takes care of building up a test database and server for you
[2013-05-28 05:13:21] chiller: good for end to end tests on dev server
[2013-05-28 05:13:52] AutomatedTester: chiller: I am sure it is, I dont use that and still get the same output but that is not your issue ;)
[2013-05-28 05:14:22] AutomatedTester: are you running tests in parallel and its killing the server during use?

[2013-05-28 11:23:20] jillio: hello. just want to ask if there is solution out there to my problem - i am currently using WebDriver. i want to visit the page until some timeout. once timeout is reached, i want the driver to abort. this seems to be impossible to do as driver.get() is blocking. has anyone found a workaround for this?
[2013-05-28 11:23:54] nicegraham, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-28 11:24:35] Dude-X: jillio: it sounds like the webpage is constantly loading when you open it?
[2013-05-28 11:24:36] jillio: i am using firefox driver if it helps
[2013-05-28 11:24:45] markalanevans, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-28 11:24:59] jillio: yep, sometimes the site i am accessing takes longer than timeout
[2013-05-28 11:25:12] Dude-X: what timeout?
[2013-05-28 11:25:15] jillio: which what i would ideally want is, driver should just give up
[2013-05-28 11:25:25] Dude-X: driver.get blocks until the page loads
[2013-05-28 11:25:34] jillio: so i have this: Wait<WebDriver> wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 15);
[2013-05-28 11:26:01] jillio: after i called driver.get(someurl);
[2013-05-28 11:26:56] jillio: after 15 secs, there is exception thrown (TimeoutException) by webdriver, however driver still continues to load the page
[2013-05-28 11:27:02] jillio: ideally i want driver to just stop
[2013-05-28 11:27:04] Dude-X: well… that's probably not an appropriate use of web driver wait;
[2013-05-28 11:27:13] Dude-X: driver.get is a blocking call
[2013-05-28 11:27:28] jillio: so does that mean there is no workaround for it?
[2013-05-28 11:27:34] Dude-X: however if you're using java, you can set the driver to use a fast load strategy
[2013-05-28 11:27:39] jillio: i'd like to reuse my driver
[2013-05-28 11:27:53] jillio: whoah! i got to google that
[2013-05-28 11:27:56] Dude-X: so that it will timeout on driver.get
[2013-05-28 11:28:14] Dude-X: this is good for infinite loading web pages (which is bad design)
[2013-05-28 11:28:24] jillio: ok thanks very much
[2013-05-28 11:28:27] jillio: ill be back shortly
[2013-05-28 11:28:40] jillio: got to read about this 'fast loading stategy'

[2013-05-28 11:29:57] lukeis: (Dude-X that's for more than just java, although the example is only in java...)
[2013-05-28 11:30:17] Dude-X: i don't know if that's been exposed in the python bindings
[2013-05-28 11:30:31] Dude-X: also i don't remember if that's a capabilities setting
[2013-05-28 11:30:33] lukeis: it's a preference on the firefox profile

[2013-05-28 11:32:36] lukeis: jillio: I don't know what state the driver is in after the timeout, but if you'd like to stop the page loading i think you can try driver.executeScript("window.stop()")
[2013-05-28 11:33:00] Dude-X: but driver.get is a blocking call...
[2013-05-28 11:33:13] lukeis: unless you have it timeout ;)
[2013-05-28 11:33:46] Dude-X: only through fast load
[2013-05-28 11:33:52] lukeis: and get doesn't always wait for your page to load
[2013-05-28 11:34:23] Dude-X: hmm that's true
[2013-05-28 11:34:55] jillio: javadoc: This is done using an HTTP GET operation, and the method will block until the load is complete

[2013-05-28 11:35:56] lukeis: "load is complete" isn't deterministic… so it does it's best guess
[2013-05-28 11:36:08] jillio: i see
[2013-05-28 11:36:43] jillio: thank you lukeis and Dude-X. i have something to work on for now
