[2013-05-13 01:03:08] barancev|2: it's an old rule :)
[2013-05-13 01:03:09] mazzachre: After "updgrading" to selenium java library 2.32 and firefox 20, some strange errors are appearing... Instead of using the existing window, like it used to, new windows and tabs are created, seemingly at random (not all the time, only some times...)
[2013-05-13 01:04:06] barancev|2: somedays, there was "two months rule", but about a year ago it was changed to "one month rule"

[2013-05-13 01:11:19] mazzachre: Could it have something to do with the window still doing something? Sometimes I will request a new url before cheking if the existing have loaded finished?

[2013-05-13 01:18:27] mazzachre: barancev|2: Hmmm... interesting... I don't actually, but I have had the problem with firefox 20.0.1 (that I am currently using) when using it manually, that sometimes control keys are sticky (ctrl+tab to change to firefox will not always release ctrl inside firefox)
[2013-05-13 01:19:41] barancev|2: so, if you push Control manually when Selenium performs click it can also affects the behaviour, that explains appearing new windows
[2013-05-13 01:19:42] mazzachre: I don't use control keys in my scripts (yet) but as the scripts are running while I am using the computer normally it might be a problem somwhow..
[2013-05-13 01:19:52] mazzachre: Ah...
[2013-05-13 01:20:37] barancev|2: also, don't push Shift when Firefox starts, otherwise it will attempt to start in "safe mode"
[2013-05-13 01:20:47] mazzachre: ok, that solves that problem :)

[2013-05-13 11:34:29] mg983: for starters
[2013-05-13 11:34:33] mg983: which is which?
[2013-05-13 11:34:56] lukeis: implicit waits are on the server side
[2013-05-13 11:35:25] mg983: can you give me an example when you would use one over the other? maybe that will help
[2013-05-13 11:35:26] lukeis: explicit waits are essentially a retry loop, pausing every 0.5 seconds
[2013-05-13 11:35:37] lukeis: i never use implicit waits
[2013-05-13 11:35:45] lukeis: :)

[2013-05-13 11:36:07] *lukeis believes one should know the state of their app and figure out the timings of things'
[2013-05-13 11:36:20] mg983: if i understand what the difference was I could
[2013-05-13 11:36:44] mg983: your explanations aren't helping, no offense :)
[2013-05-13 11:37:06] jimevans: mg983: let me take a crack at this.
[2013-05-13 11:37:18] *lukeis yields to jim ;)'
[2013-05-13 11:37:19] mg983: Thanks :)
[2013-05-13 11:37:34] jimevans: every driver has two components, a "client" or "local" side, and a "server" or "remote" side.
[2013-05-13 11:37:48] zac_sel, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-05-13 11:37:50] jimevans: the "local" side is the local language binding that you write your code to use.
[2013-05-13 11:38:10] mg983: so, PHP, in the instance of using PHPUnit_Extensions_Selenium2TestCast ?
[2013-05-13 11:38:37] jimevans: i guess. i don't know php worth anything.
[2013-05-13 11:38:41] jimevans: the "remote" side is anything that knows how to handle the webdriver json over http protocol.
[2013-05-13 11:39:27] jimevans: that can be the java webdriver remote server, or an instance of chromedriver.exe, or an instance of IEDriverServer.exe, or the browser extension that the firefox driver installs into an anonymous firefox profile to drive the browser.
[2013-05-13 11:39:35] mg983: would that be the JVM
[2013-05-13 11:39:36] mg983: yeah ok
[2013-05-13 11:39:39] mg983: I get that
[2013-05-13 11:39:44] admc1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-13 11:40:12] jimevans: so implicit waits are implemented at the remote side. you set the implicit wait timeout, and the remote side knows every time you call findElement to keep trying until the timeout.
[2013-05-13 11:40:18] barancev: I can explain the difference from a user point of view :)
[2013-05-13 11:40:31] akoumjian, quitting. (Excess Flood)
[2013-05-13 11:40:31] barancev: let's suppose you want to check presence of an element
[2013-05-13 11:40:39] barancev: right NOW

[2013-05-13 11:41:01] lukeis: Image a click that sets a timeout of 3 seconds before it adds a new "some_id" element on the page.  driver.findElement(By.id("some_id"))   with an implicit wait set will wait until X seconds have elapsed before returning with an Element not found (or return your element if it existed on the page, if you set it higher than 3 seconds it will find it).
[2013-05-13 11:41:09] akoumjian, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-13 11:41:12] jimevans: explicit waits require a local-side construct that repeatedly waits for the condition with a small wait in between each call.
[2013-05-13 11:41:16] barancev: you can't do this if you use implicit wait, because when you call driver.findElement(...) it will block on the browser side for the specified timeout
[2013-05-13 11:41:22] p_l, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2013-05-13 11:41:25] jimevans: most language bindings contain some kind of
[2013-05-13 11:41:35] jimevans: "explicit wait" construct
[2013-05-13 11:41:42] jimevans: but you can manually create one yourself too.
[2013-05-13 11:42:35] p_l, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-13 11:42:35] mg983: explicit wait is just essentially hammering?
[2013-05-13 11:42:40] mg983: with a small delay?
[2013-05-13 11:42:57] jimevans: mg983: i'd prefer the term "polling"
[2013-05-13 11:42:58] lukeis: yep, it's a retry loop
[2013-05-13 11:43:09] mg983: semantics shmeantics :)
[2013-05-13 11:43:45] jimevans: i know where you're coming from, but semantics matter to me, so let's not be too flip about 'em, if you don't mind.
[2013-05-13 11:43:50] barancev: implicit wait is a "retry loop" too, but on the browser side
[2013-05-13 11:44:17] mg983: jimevans: okay I gotcha
[2013-05-13 11:44:38] kkania, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-13 11:44:39] mg983: jimevans: by polling do you mean checking/testing/looking for?
[2013-05-13 11:44:46] amitev2, changing nick to amitev.
[2013-05-13 11:44:47] kkania: jarib: ping
[2013-05-13 11:44:56] jimevans: here's the thing about implicit waits: the *only* thing they work for is checking the existence of an element. they can't be used for element visibility, checking the presence of an alert, checking for an element to disappear, or anything else.
[2013-05-13 11:45:15] lukeis: one of the reasons i prefer explicit to implicit, is if you want to make sure an element doesn't appear, an explicit wait will satisfy the condition (nearly) immediately, while an implicit will have to wait till the implicitly wait timeout is complete
[2013-05-13 11:45:34] jimevans: mg983: yes, the explicit wait checks for the condition, if the condition isn't met, it waits for a small bit, then tries again.
[2013-05-13 11:45:54] mg983: what is the difference between checking if an element exists or its visibility? if its invisible doesn't it not exist for all intents and purposes?
[2013-05-13 11:46:02] jimevans: not true!
[2013-05-13 11:46:36] eanxgeek, changing nick to eanxgeek|log.
[2013-05-13 11:46:38] jimevans: consider some javascript frameworks that create "wait spinner" elements. it may simply hide and show the spinner element to save performance on constructing the element and adding it to the DOM every time.
[2013-05-13 11:46:47] mg983: >:o
[2013-05-13 11:46:58] lukeis: display:none  or visibility:hidden ;)
[2013-05-13 11:46:59] mg983: but it's still there, just invisible?
[2013-05-13 11:47:00] mg983: yeah
[2013-05-13 11:47:11] mg983: that's right
[2013-05-13 11:47:56] mg983: thanks barancev jimevans lukeis — this is making more sense (i put you guys in alphabetical order to avoid choosing a different order :-P)
[2013-05-13 11:48:17] lukeis: heh
[2013-05-13 11:48:27] jimevans: well, hopefully, it'll help.
[2013-05-13 11:48:36] mg983: another question...
[2013-05-13 11:48:50] mg983: if I click on a link… will it wait for that link to fully load before executing the next step?
[2013-05-13 11:48:52] jimevans: using PHP, i don't know if those bindings have a WebDriverWait equivalent built in, but it's pretty easy to construct one.
[2013-05-13 11:49:13] lukeis: jimevans: what's the t-shirt again? "Selenium Support Team"?
[2013-05-13 11:49:31] jimevans: mg983: the full answer to that is "it depends".
[2013-05-13 11:49:46] lukeis: mg983: the answer is, it depends…. selenium does a best effort to wait for the page to load, but there's many ways that a page can be loaded
[2013-05-13 11:49:55] lukeis: :-D
[2013-05-13 11:49:59] jimevans: but the short version is that a driver will do its best to try to wait, give a best effort, but there are no guarantees.
[2013-05-13 11:50:07] mg983: it appears that it is doing that
[2013-05-13 11:50:13] mg983: out of 20 tests it failed once
[2013-05-13 11:50:17] mg983: the first time oddly enough
[2013-05-13 11:50:24] lukeis: caching ;)
[2013-05-13 11:50:48] mg983: ::smh:: of course
[2013-05-13 11:50:55] jimevans: remember, though, there are no guarantees, so depending on the page structure, it could work sometimes and fail at others.
[2013-05-13 11:51:00] mg983: right
[2013-05-13 11:51:14] jimevans: a far, far better approach is to always wait for the *next* thing you want to interact with.
[2013-05-13 11:51:44] mg983: <pseudocode>waitUntilElementExists(".vote-again");</pseudocode>
[2013-05-13 11:51:47] mg983: like that?
[2013-05-13 11:51:58] lukeis: yup
[2013-05-13 11:52:00] jimevans: pretty much.

[2013-05-13 12:47:36] freynaud: the hub has to do the work anyway and detect the session has timed out anyway, to free the resources

[2013-05-13 12:48:04] freynaud: you can always remove the /delete message send from the hub, but it doesn't really save you anything
[2013-05-13 12:48:35] freynaud: and at least, you prevent the case where the node timeout if > hub one

[2013-05-13 15:49:05] desertfoxatx: Hi, Is there a list of browser versions supported per selenium version?
[2013-05-13 15:49:30] desertfoxatx: Can't find any on the site, or google pages.

[2013-05-13 15:53:24] lukeis: been meaning to document it ;)  but really the only thing that matters is the version of FF, for that you can get an understanding by reading the :changelog
[2013-05-13 15:53:24] selbot2__: .NET: http://goo.gl/zBIjE | Java: http://goo.gl/5B23U | Ruby: http://goo.gl/yN6Qm | Python: http://goo.gl/7BtCb | IDE: http://goo.gl/50vLB

[2013-05-13 15:54:10] lukeis: desertfoxatx: so in general our latest release supports FF version N  (where N is the current release at the time) and N-1 followed by ESR, ESR-1  (which is 17, 10)
[2013-05-13 15:54:35] desertfoxatx: Awesome. thank you.
[2013-05-13 15:54:38] lukeis: so… 2.32.0 supports 20,19, 17, 10
[2013-05-13 15:54:53] lukeis: 2.33 will be out soon (maybe this week) and will support 21, 20, 17, 10

[2013-05-13 17:24:01] Scoding: I was wondering if someone could point me to the origins of my error, if I don't shut down a browser session via selenium, and try to close it normally(on mac) it still stays open, i'm stuck with 10 firefox windows…
