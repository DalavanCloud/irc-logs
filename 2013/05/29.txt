[2013-05-29 02:52:22] AutomatedTester: Scoding: I personally recommend the Element-34 version
[2013-05-29 02:52:36] AutomatedTester: which is a fork of the Facebook code and is maintained, unlike the Facebook code

[2013-05-29 03:02:46] davehunt: I'm not certain it's in the Python API, but if it is, that's where it will be documented
[2013-05-29 03:02:54] ronny: davehunt: not seeing any logging there
[2013-05-29 03:03:09] davehunt: AutomatedTester might know more, I've not used logs with WD
[2013-05-29 03:03:55] ronny: davehunt: i only wanted to know, cause mozwebqa exposed logs
[2013-05-29 03:04:02] ronny: but atm i just killed it ^^
[2013-05-29 03:04:14] ronny: (the logs only worked with the rc api
[2013-05-29 03:04:15] davehunt: it only exposes logs for RC
[2013-05-29 03:05:19] ronny: well, then i'll just leave it gone for now
[2013-05-29 03:05:30] davehunt: sgtm

[2013-05-29 03:38:44] Ardesco: Manoj_: last time i checked safari driver didn't support alerts at all
[2013-05-29 03:38:56] Ardesco: due to the fact it's a JS implementation and alerts are blocking
[2013-05-29 03:39:09] Ardesco: I may be out of date now though
[2013-05-29 03:50:47] Manoj_: Ardesco: seems to be still there are few issues on Alerts.
[2013-05-29 03:51:18] Ardesco: as in they aren't supported
[2013-05-29 03:51:19] Ardesco: ?
[2013-05-29 03:51:50] Manoj_: yes
[2013-05-29 03:52:11] Ardesco: that's kind of a limitation of a JS only driver
[2013-05-29 03:52:32] Ardesco: alerts are blocking so as soon as you see an alert it kills everything dead until it is interacted with
[2013-05-29 03:52:44] Manoj_: I believe it will automatically dismiss the alerts and will not allow the user to interact with like how the other browser's does.
[2013-05-29 03:52:49] Manoj_: exactly.
[2013-05-29 03:52:59] Ardesco: you would need to get under the hood to fix that issue
[2013-05-29 03:53:12] Ardesco: it's a limitation of the driver, not an "issue"
[2013-05-29 03:53:21] Manoj_: right.
[2013-05-29 03:53:40] Manoj_: do you remember how it was in RC ?
[2013-05-29 03:53:57] Ardesco: nope haven't used RC for years
[2013-05-29 03:54:03] Ardesco: 4-5 i think?
[2013-05-29 03:54:55] Ardesco: I don't remember Safari being particularly well supported in RC tbh
[2013-05-29 03:55:32] Manoj_: yeah, I have been given with a sick task.. to fix issues on RC scripts in Safari :(
[2013-05-29 03:56:17] Ardesco: sounds like a pointless task, current version of Safari wasn't a twinkle in apples eye when RC was current
[2013-05-29 03:56:42] Ardesco: I wouldn't expect RC to support Safari 6 tbh
[2013-05-29 04:00:22] jacksoncage, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-29 04:00:23] Ardesco: looks like iOS-driver supports alerts
[2013-05-29 04:00:28] Ardesco: so there may be hope for safari
[2013-05-29 04:03:23] Manoj_: good point , I just realized am on Mountain Lion and its Safari 6

[2013-05-29 07:20:53] jimevans: AutomatedTester: vaguely, but yeah.
[2013-05-29 07:20:56] AutomatedTester: what was the magic you suggested

[2013-05-29 07:21:33] AutomatedTester: I remember
[2013-05-29 07:21:38] AutomatedTester: check parents
[2013-05-29 07:23:38] jimevans: right. so when you call elementFromPoint, you'll get an element back. if it's not the element you want, you need to walk up the DOM from the elementFromPoint-element to see if the element you want is an ancestor. if i remember right. but i've only had my first cup of coffee today too.

[2013-05-29 07:29:29] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: this patch is if element A obscures element B and both elements are in different parts of the tree
[2013-05-29 07:29:42] simonstewart: Ugh
[2013-05-29 07:29:47] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: so walking the DOM says both of visible which is a lie
[2013-05-29 07:29:52] barancev: to reimlement click we should change bot.action.click to work with first rectangle only

[2013-05-29 07:38:47] barancev: especially for elements in nested frames
[2013-05-29 07:38:58] simonstewart: on page should be the only consistent one

[2013-05-29 08:13:56] brockfredin: jimevans I get a lot of assembly diagnostic occasionally when running the Selenium driver.  If I step into code, sometimes it shows the actual assembly language step by step.  Throwing stuff onto the stack, addresses, and a reference.  Do you ever promote the use of Caller information in C# for debugging purposes?

[2013-05-29 08:26:04] jimevans: so you get the disassembly window (or more correctly, you get thrown into the raw MSIL code)
[2013-05-29 08:28:22] brockfredin: jimevans That's exactly right.  This is fascinating to finally have explained.

[2013-05-29 09:22:23] jimevans: no, i fully realize that.
[2013-05-29 09:23:33] jimevans: but the story of "for opera beyond version 'x', you don't need the java runtime" is compelling to me.
[2013-05-29 09:24:24] jimevans: yeah, i know i'm in the minority, and yeah, i know it's petty, but it's where i'm at.
[2013-05-29 09:24:27] andreastt: That's true.
[2013-05-29 09:24:56] andreastt: It's pretty much anything that's true for Chromium is pretty much true for Opera now.
[2013-05-29 09:26:38] lukeis: so chromedriver will drive opera in the future? :)
[2013-05-29 09:26:45] jimevans: i'll invest some time into it when things stabilize a bit more. and by "things" i mean "chromedriver2 and opera.next" :)

[2013-05-29 12:24:42] AutomatedTester: gdennis: have you finished your isShown patch yet?
[2013-05-29 12:25:02] gdennis: AutomatedTester: internally, I have one more change to submit
[2013-05-29 12:25:08] gdennis: and then I'll sync back out
[2013-05-29 12:25:32] manoj_: see yaâ€¦!! gotta get some sleep !!
[2013-05-29 12:25:40] gdennis: I'm taking away the isTransform stuff, because that turns out not to be the key issue with those examples
[2013-05-29 12:26:10] gdennis: the issue is that the element is positioned entirely to the left or above an ancestor element that has non-visible overflow
[2013-05-29 12:26:31] AutomatedTester: gdennis: so the tests that I have are passing without change?
[2013-05-29 12:26:35] manoj_, quitting. (Quit: manoj_)
[2013-05-29 12:27:03] gdennis: AutomatedTester: they are passing with my new overflow calculation
[2013-05-29 12:27:35] AutomatedTester: gdennis: interesting that overflow fixings transform: translateX(-10000)
[2013-05-29 12:27:40] AutomatedTester: I look forward to seeing the code
[2013-05-29 12:27:52] gdennis: I factored out a new function called getOverflowState that is replacing isShown's overflow calculation, getParentOverflow, and eventually isScrolledIntoView
[2013-05-29 12:28:14] AutomatedTester: overflow seems a weird name though
[2013-05-29 12:28:19] AutomatedTester: since its not an overflow object
[2013-05-29 12:28:33] gdennis: I'm open to better names
[2013-05-29 12:28:47] gdennis: getOverflowState returns either NONE, SCROLL, or HIDDEN
[2013-05-29 12:29:07] gdennis: SCROLL means it is overflows some ancestor element but can be scrolled into view
[2013-05-29 12:29:19] gdennis: HIDDEN means it overflows some ancestor element but cannot be scrolled into view
[2013-05-29 12:29:37] gdennis: NONE means it does not overflow any ancestor
[2013-05-29 12:29:50] AutomatedTester: and a transform is hidden?
[2013-05-29 12:29:57] foundatron, quitting. (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[2013-05-29 12:30:57] gdennis: I know I'm using "overflow" here as a transitive verb
[2013-05-29 12:30:57] gdennis: if the transform makes the element overflow an ancestor, then yes, which was the case with those isTransform unit tests
[2013-05-29 12:31:23] AutomatedTester: right, its "overflowing" the body is some cases
[2013-05-29 12:31:46] AutomatedTester: sounds good
[2013-05-29 12:31:53] ddary, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-05-29 12:32:40] gdennis: and there's a subtle and important distinction between overflowing the body and overflowing the document element and how overflow styles are applied to each --- it's pretty tricky, and took some time to figure out
