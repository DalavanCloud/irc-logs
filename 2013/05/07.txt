[2013-05-07 06:18:48] trandatnh: jimevans: because I have many simple tasks which can be automated.
[2013-05-07 06:19:11] jimevans: using selenium (or any UI-based automation tool) to automate email retrieval is very, very much using the wrong tool for the job.
[2013-05-07 06:19:44] trandatnh: jimevans, could you tell me why?

[2013-05-07 06:20:58] barancev|2: trandatnh: what's the purpose of this automation? do you want to check UI works as expected? do you want to jsy monitor the site availability? do you want to read email content?
[2013-05-07 06:21:26] trandatnh: jimevans: I'm not only going to cheack email, I also need to login into sites, and some websites require cookie, session and all.
[2013-05-07 06:21:28] jimevans: be glad to. there are much better (and more reliable) ways to interact with an email inbox. barancev|2 mentioned one earlier (IMAP). you can also use POP3 in some cases. either of those would be superior if your goal is to check email content. it doesn't rely on a UI-based client which can change without notice. it doesn't rely on timing.
[2013-05-07 06:21:33] mallikarjun: @barancev , im beginner to selenium. I want some existing sample framework on selenium testng. So that i can understood easily

[2013-05-07 06:22:42] barancev|2: mallikarjun: what do you mean by "testing framework"? a sample test set for some service? a tool to run selenium-based tests? anything else?
[2013-05-07 06:22:50] trandatnh: barancev|2, no, I don't need to check UI works as expected. I just want to read the mail content. then submit the content to another website
[2013-05-07 06:23:04] barancev|2: trandatnh: so use IMAP or POP3
[2013-05-07 06:23:09] jimevans: trandatnh: you can use selenium for those other use cases, that's what it's intended for. but don't use selenium to get the content of the emai.
[2013-05-07 06:23:13] jimevans: or email even.
[2013-05-07 06:23:42] trandatnh: yes, many thanks for the email reading suggestion.
[2013-05-07 06:23:46] trandatnh: :)
[2013-05-07 06:24:06] jimevans: (though depending on the mechanism for "submit[ting] the content to another website", it may be more efficient to use straight HTTP requests without involving a browser at all.
[2013-05-07 06:24:11] trandatnh: and in case of login to websites which require session and cookies?
[2013-05-07 06:24:36] trandatnh: in case I want to login into a bank account
[2013-05-07 06:24:37] nirvdrum, joining. (#selenium)

[2013-05-07 06:24:58] trandatnh: to do transfer money or buy stuff on the internet
[2013-05-07 06:25:28] trandatnh: because I don't want to fill a lot of infomation, I want 1 click to do thing instead.
[2013-05-07 06:25:41] jimevans: and this is something you'll be doing repeatedly, and use email to get content for this?
[2013-05-07 06:26:26] trandatnh: yes, somehow, bank will send me an email which have password/code/id for transaction...
[2013-05-07 06:26:40] jimevans: trandatnh: then change your bank.

[2013-05-07 06:29:56] jimevans: trandatnh: it sounds like you have a pretty big job ahead of you, unless you have only a few specific sites you're going to be doing these tasks on.
[2013-05-07 06:30:05] trandatnh: so, may selenium ide, selenium client, selenium rc or selenium webdriver help?
[2013-05-07 06:31:06] trandatnh: correct, I only have a few specify sites include bank account, email, and purchase site
[2013-05-07 06:31:18] trandatnh: then done
[2013-05-07 06:31:29] trandatnh: nothing else is requires.
[2013-05-07 06:32:46] jimevans: i suspect it's possible.
[2013-05-07 06:33:06] jimevans: it's going to be fragile, and subject to the whims of whatever sites you're using.
[2013-05-07 06:33:24] jimevans: when the bank decides to completely redo its website, everything is going to break.
[2013-05-07 06:33:31] jimevans: but knock yourself out.
[2013-05-07 06:34:11] jimevans: be careful though. by automating any of these sites which you don't have control over, you may be violating the terms of service of the website.
[2013-05-07 06:34:15] trandatnh: I must to accept it, if bank's site changed. the code should change accordingly
[2013-05-07 06:34:31] jimevans: many have clauses that specifically prohibit the use of automation software to use the site.
[2013-05-07 06:35:02] llaskin: trandatnh: its definitely nto a "small" task what you describe
[2013-05-07 06:35:07] trandatnh: jimevans, yes of course I won't do anything overhead, my goal is purchase, everything should be in care manner
[2013-05-07 06:35:17] llaskin: I'd budget 3+ months minimum, and thats with advance knowledge of webdriver...
[2013-05-07 06:35:23] jimevans: to be honest, you've been sufficiently vague about your actual workflow, that i can't offer anything more specific

[2013-05-07 06:40:17] trandatnh: it's may give better performance, but it's not a browser. so that it can't execute javascript.
[2013-05-07 06:40:41] jimevans: trandatnh: i think selenium might be a spectacularly bad choice for what you're trying to do. this is exactly what i was getting at when i said "depending on the mechanism… it might be more efficient to use straight HTTP requests without involving a browser at all"
[2013-05-07 06:41:41] trandatnh: yes, I'm comparing all possible approach.
[2013-05-07 06:41:49] jimevans: i might be able to give a more comprehensive analysis of the right tools for the job if i knew specifically which sites you were trying to work with.
[2013-05-07 06:42:10] jimevans: and how you expected to use the information from those sites in an example workflow.
[2013-05-07 06:42:43] jimevans: but you've only spoken about that in vague terms, so i don't think i'm going to be much help.
[2013-05-07 06:43:09] trandatnh: thanks jimevans, because everything is in my mind...

[2013-05-07 06:43:45] barancev|2: or an issue?
[2013-05-07 06:43:58] trandatnh: ok, let I imagine what I can do... I have a visa account. I want to use the visa account to buy stuff and re-sell it for others
[2013-05-07 06:44:51] trandatnh: I may go to a airline site to buy air ticket. I may go to amazon.com, ebay.com to buy anything
[2013-05-07 06:44:52] barancev|2: trandatnh: almost all the sites I know that do financial operations prohibit use of automation software. pleare read carefully the terms of service!
[2013-05-07 06:45:53] trandatnh: I'm not sure, but in my country we have 3 airlines, 2 of them provide API for searching/booking/buying ticket
[2013-05-07 06:45:54] asavchuk: barancev|2: issues with FF MoveTargetOutOfBoundsException/MouseMove... - i spent some time and found 2 diff. issues with float coordinates - for native/sync events.
[2013-05-07 06:46:15] jimevans: trandath: okay, now you've gone from a very specific problem ("automate a specific set of sites to accomplish a particular task") to a very general one ("be able to automate any e-commerce site to automate purchase of anything").
[2013-05-07 06:46:27] trandatnh: the third airline doesn't, so that I have to implement a automation for that airline

[2013-05-07 06:47:05] trandatnh: jimevans, thanks , it's exactly what i want
[2013-05-07 06:47:09] asavchuk: "found" == figured out the reason.
[2013-05-07 06:47:44] barancev|2: asavchuk: aha, float, yes, I remember I asked you about this already, and I suspected there are many other places where it can cause a bug
[2013-05-07 06:47:50] trandatnh: barancev|2, yes, but also I can use the API to create my own application to communicate with the sites

[2013-05-07 06:49:02] barancev|2: trandatnh: aure, API is intended to use for integration. it is light, it does not affect performance in the same weay as when you load the whole page in the browser, it allows to identify you by the API key, etc
[2013-05-07 06:49:31] asavchuk: barancev|2: yeah, i'm in progress :)

[2013-05-07 06:50:11] jimevans: trandatnh: yes. your general "automate any e-commerce site to automate purchases of any item" is far to broad to speak to.
[2013-05-07 06:50:22] jimevans: s/to broad/too broad/
[2013-05-07 06:50:23] trandatnh: I will check the term of service of the site.
[2013-05-07 06:50:45] trandatnh: :D

[2013-05-07 08:25:30] jimevans: and i'd be happy to submit the patch (though i know nothing about the mozilla code base, or the submission culture, or the procedure). where should i start? what, specifically, is the "patch" that needs contributing to get this going?
