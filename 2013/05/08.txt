[2013-05-08 00:05:22] trandatnh: hi there, I want to do stress test to a cinema website. It is included search movie by name, date, cinema, discount. and the searching should be run for at least 8h continuously.
[2013-05-08 00:06:02] trandatnh: is it possible to use selenium? and which type of selenium rc or selenium webdriver is the best fit for this test?
[2013-05-08 00:06:46] stephend: load-testing?
[2013-05-08 00:06:47] trandatnh: this is the website https://www.galaxycine.vn/
[2013-05-08 00:06:55] stephend: I'd recommend a different type of tool
[2013-05-08 00:07:07] stephend: and RC is pretty much deprecated afaik
[2013-05-08 00:07:29] trandatnh: so which tool is fit with the requirement?
[2013-05-08 00:07:47] stephend: if you know Python, I'd recommend http://ziade.org/2011/07/27/how-to-stress-test-your-app-using-funkload-part-1/
[2013-05-08 00:07:51] stephend: (or even if you don't)
[2013-05-08 00:08:49] stephend: some folks use jmeter, but we moved from mostly jmeter to funkload
[2013-05-08 00:09:17] trandatnh: oh, I haven't known about this before, thanks stephend
[2013-05-08 00:09:31] stephend: np
[2013-05-08 00:09:56] trandatnh: so what kind of tests are fit to selenium?
[2013-05-08 00:10:12] stephend: trandatnh: functional, mostly
[2013-05-08 00:10:19] stephend: trandatnh: what language do you program in?
[2013-05-08 00:10:25] trandatnh: when I researched on the Internet, ppl talk about selenium a lot.
[2013-05-08 00:10:42] trandatnh: currently I wish a java system
[2013-05-08 00:10:48] stephend: ah
[2013-05-08 00:11:09] trandatnh: rather than python, I don't know python ... I can learn but it takes time you know.
[2013-05-08 00:11:14] stephend: trandatnh: at its core, selenium is best for "emulating real user and browser actions"
[2013-05-08 00:11:52] trandatnh: what does it means? could you give an example stephend.
[2013-05-08 00:13:12] barancev: if you prefer Java look at grinder
[2013-05-08 00:13:18] stephend: yeah, good call
[2013-05-08 00:13:23] stephend: our Web Ops guys use that too
[2013-05-08 00:13:30] stephend: log replay, even, sometimes
[2013-05-08 00:13:33] eranm, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-08 00:13:41] stephend: if you want to replay apache traffic in bulk
[2013-05-08 00:15:19] trandatnh: I know this forum is not for asking about other tools but do you know HttpUnit?
[2013-05-08 00:15:30] trandatnh: I heard about it sometimes
[2013-05-08 00:15:45] stephend: heard of it, but haven't used it, or know anyone who has
[2013-05-08 00:16:07] barancev: HttpUnit in context of load testing?
[2013-05-08 00:16:41] trandatnh: no, just HttpUnit in compare with selenium
[2013-05-08 00:17:03] trandatnh: some ppl on the Internet reference to HttpUnit when they talk about Selenium.
[2013-05-08 00:17:20] barancev: HttpUnit works on HTTP level, selenium works on the Browser UI level
[2013-05-08 00:17:28] barancev: see the difference
[2013-05-08 00:17:42] trandatnh: ok, very clear. thanks barancev :)
[2013-05-08 00:17:57] stephend: trandatnh: we used to write selenium for _everything_
[2013-05-08 00:18:20] stephend: but then, in Python, we used other libraries like "requests" or "urllib" etc., to do response-code and URL-redirect checking, for instance
[2013-05-08 00:19:06] barancev: stephend: have you tried mechanize (and multi-mechanize for load)? I like these tools much
[2013-05-08 00:19:21] stephend: barancev: couple folks on my team have, and love it, yeah
[2013-05-08 00:19:43] stephend: we're still using beautifulsoup in places :-(
[2013-05-08 00:20:08] trandatnh: thanks stephend, barancev :) this channel is very friendly :-)
[2013-05-08 00:20:17] stephend: trandatnh: most of the time it is :-)
[2013-05-08 00:20:40] stephend: trandatnh: this is Python, so brace yourself: https://github.com/mozilla/mozwebqa-test-templates
[2013-05-08 00:21:14] stephend: trandatnh: and it's page-object model, which, if you're writing Selenium you probably want to look at using, so the selenium calls are a bit abstracted, there
[2013-05-08 00:21:48] trandatnh: stephend: yes, I will do research on the Internet and findout the best fit for my project. many thanks.

[2013-05-08 00:58:11] asavchuk: all other parts at this issue are already fixed, as i understand
[2013-05-08 00:58:13] barancev: asavchuk: want to turn them off by default?
[2013-05-08 00:58:45] barancev: I'm ok with it
[2013-05-08 00:59:21] frankensteeen: we get an error while starting the testcase.. and no firefox is running after this do you have an idea?
[2013-05-08 00:59:24] barancev: frankensteeen: to run a browser on a headless machine you can use a virtual x-server, e.g. чмаи
[2013-05-08 00:59:35] barancev: xvfb, even
[2013-05-08 00:59:53] frankensteeen: yes i use xvfb
[2013-05-08 01:00:27] frankensteeen: i take a screen shot over import and see only black
[2013-05-08 01:00:28] asavchuk: yes, sounds good. but after that will user be able to turn it on inside selenium-standalone jar ? inside own code user can do it already.

[2013-05-08 01:03:15] barancev: asavchuk: JUL is one of the worst logging frameworks, especially in regard of configuration
[2013-05-08 01:03:58] barancev: yes, a user can reconfigure it, but it's not a simple task and I hope nobody will need this
[2013-05-08 01:04:08] frankensteeen: we get an error111 while running a test. the jar is running checked over ps
[2013-05-08 01:04:23] smccarthy: frankensteeen: what version of selenium, what version of firefox
[2013-05-08 01:05:47] frankensteeen: 2.2.32.0 and firefox 17.0.5
[2013-05-08 01:06:17] barancev: what is error111?
[2013-05-08 01:06:42] barancev: it is not a message selenium or browser throws

[2013-05-08 01:08:11] barancev: can you run the same tests on a machine with the display? it this a headless-specific issue or more broad?
[2013-05-08 01:08:43] frankensteeen: by running a test with check_selinum

[2013-05-08 01:15:14] frankensteeen: we use it as it comes so i think as server

I have located it to sending multiple clicks in one go (or in quick succession) adding a Thread.sleep(10) before and after each click solves it, but that does not look particulary nice...

[2013-05-08 04:07:05] AutomatedTester: qdos: selenium server tries to pick the "best" browser according to your desired capabilities
[2013-05-08 04:09:14] qdos: so if I have DesiredCapabilities.Android in my tests, and i've defined "browser=android,platform=ANDROID" on my node, that should in theory "find" the correct one? (I only have 1 instance of android running). It finds the correct box, as shown by the output on the running node

[2013-05-08 04:13:32] AutomatedTester: hmm
[2013-05-08 04:18:22] qdos: ohh.. so going by that then, if the HOST machine/node that is running the emulator isnt Platform.android, then it would never work?
[2013-05-08 04:21:05] barancev: it seems to be so, according to the code
[2013-05-08 04:24:38] qdos: im sure im not reading that right.. my emulator is running on a win7 VM.  is that saying that the win7 box should be reporting that its an android platform, in order to allow the android driver? if so, that seems a little strange..
[2013-05-08 04:26:55] barancev: I suspect this is simply a bug :)

[2013-05-08 06:45:28] dawagner: Then it isn't shown

[2013-05-08 07:05:34] mazzachre: llaskin: Sry, was away working... Well, I would not expect to have to explicitly wait.. What I do is basically "click" on a checkbox and on the next line of my code "click" on a button element, the action of the button element is different based on the checked state of the checkbox, and in 1 out of 3 case this works as expected in the other 2 the element is not checked... When I pause it in debugger it depends on where I pause it,
[2013-05-08 07:05:34] mazzachre: if it ends up working or not...
[2013-05-08 07:05:36] aweiteka, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-08 07:07:04] llaskin: right since the action is different
[2013-05-08 07:07:08] llaskin: you have to wait for that element to update
[2013-05-08 07:07:14] llaskin: of course it works when you pause it....
[2013-05-08 07:07:42] mazzachre: There is no action on the checkbox... It is simply read by the page submit (the button submits the page)

[2013-05-08 07:09:00] mazzachre: llaskin: And it does not always work when I pause it... If I pause it before the click even and the start running (the wto clicks in row) it works, if I pause it after the first click before the second, it does not work (same as running the script itself)

[2013-05-08 07:14:23] llaskin: mazzachre: i am betting that when you perform Action 1, the html in the DOM changes, Action 2 can't happen since you are probably not refinding the element, or waiting long enough for the change to happen

[2013-05-08 07:14:43] cgoldberg: llaskin, i wont :)
[2013-05-08 07:15:40] asavchuk: cgoldberg: at python side all looks good - use grid2 + nose + nose-xunit + nose-xunitmp.
[2013-05-08 07:15:49] asavchuk: *we use
[2013-05-08 07:15:51] adamgoucher: i would suggest parallelizing instances of the same browser, not parallel instances of different browsers. latter is a pain in the ass to report / debug
[2013-05-08 07:15:57] cgoldberg: llaskin, so *most* of the time in my tests is spent in browser setup/teardown (which I do every testcase).  this is disk and cpu intensive... so I'm wondering what kind of actuals peedup i'll see
[2013-05-08 07:16:13] cgoldberg: adamgoucher, that part's easy ;)

[2013-05-08 07:16:29] mazzachre: llaskin: No, there are no changes to the DOM I am quite certain... Also, it is not the the second click goes wrong, it works, it is the first click that is simply being ignored (the checkbox is never checked, but the form is submitted anyway)

[2013-05-08 07:17:11] llaskin: are you talking about having multiple drivers inside each setup?
[2013-05-08 07:17:37] cgoldberg: llaskin, i'm talking about building a suite of tests.. that runs in parallel (or at some level of concurrency) on the local machine
[2013-05-08 07:17:51] cgoldberg: llaskin, i already have a massive distributed jenkins cluster.. this is for local testing
[2013-05-08 07:18:21] *adamgoucher thinks cgoldberg is just angling for a bigger development machine :)'
[2013-05-08 07:18:27] cgoldberg: hah
[2013-05-08 07:19:09] cgoldberg: adamgoucher, and *am* trying to parallelize diff instances  .. but i've got a great solutions for aggregating results
[2013-05-08 07:20:26] adamgoucher: i've written similar solutions. but i also suspect 'you' and 'my market' are on different places on the curve. single browser per run (even if the executing is acting in parallel) is a much better fit
[2013-05-08 07:20:31] cgoldberg: adamgoucher, i have to buy my own hardware :P
[2013-05-08 07:21:31] cgoldberg: adamgoucher, so i have test cases.. each with their own instances of webdriver.  i can't meld all that together.  i need to run them as-is in parallel
[2013-05-08 07:22:27] cgoldberg: so each test cases uses only one browser.. but many may be running at once.. at the whim of the cpu scheduler
[2013-05-08 07:22:56] adamgoucher: ya. thats pretty easy-peasy. if you are dependcy injecting you instance to your page object. i had the driver as a singleton for awhile -- makes parallel 'hard' :d
[2013-05-08 07:23:58] cgoldberg: i'll let you guys know how it goes.  the implementation I have in my head seems too easy.. there's gotta be a few ratholes to fall in
[2013-05-08 07:25:07] adamgoucher: my concern is always when you have something like 6 different browser types and then run a single testcase 6x paralell -- one per browser. that kind worries me. 6 testcases with 1 browser at the same time is pretty useful

[2013-05-08 10:18:43] DavidScherer: I like the IDE in that I'm not going to have to spend days/weeks creating/updating/maintaining these tests.

[2013-05-08 10:20:22] jimevans: DavidScherer: if you're a backend developer, comfortable with languages like java, ruby, python and the like, then IDE is going to give you far *less* maintainable code in the long run.
[2013-05-08 10:20:23] DavidScherer: The people I work under used to work for Highmark and apparently Highmark is obsessed with automation testing. So they want automation testing.

[2013-05-08 10:22:33] jimevans: to me, the phrase "maintainable test written using Selenium IDE" describes an impossible state.
[2013-05-08 10:22:53] Dude-X: a contradiction of terms
[2013-05-08 10:23:34] DavidScherer: So you're suggesting I use Selenium Remote Control?
[2013-05-08 10:23:40] jimevans: but i'm really getting tired of tilting at that particular windmill, so i think i'm just going to start keeping quiet whenever someone pipes up that they want help using selenium ide.

[2013-05-08 10:24:28] jimevans: DavidScherer: that's one of the reasons i don't like IDE. in addition to it being record-playback, it's also focused on selenium RC, which has an API i absolutely despise.
[2013-05-08 10:24:48] barancev: let's kick down rc?
[2013-05-08 10:25:10] DavidScherer: jimevans: I'm running out of Selenium tools here, :P Which should I use?

[2013-05-08 10:26:37] jimevans: DavidScherer: i like the webdriver api myself. though if you're dead-set on php, you'll need a third-party language binding. i believe adamgoucher may have some recommendations on that score.

[2013-05-08 10:27:26] DavidScherer: jimevans: Well, considering over 5k lines of PHP in this project....
[2013-05-08 10:27:41] adamgoucher: mine? http://github.com/element-34/php-webdriver :)

[2013-05-08 10:28:02] DavidScherer: jimevans: Also, I'm wanting to test the UI, not necessarily the PHP...
[2013-05-08 10:28:33] DavidScherer: adamgoucher: what's the difference between your PHP driver and Facebook's?
[2013-05-08 10:28:44] jimevans: DavidScherer: that's what the webdriver bindings are for. driving the browser. i'm just pointing you toward a way to do that with php instead of java, .net, ruby or python.
[2013-05-08 10:28:54] jimevans: it all uses the same technology on the backend.
[2013-05-08 10:28:57] adamgoucher: mines not abandoned, and has /way. more functionality than theirs. since they abandoned it...
[2013-05-08 10:30:03] DavidScherer: adamgoucher: Good to know. People (me) see the FB version and think "Score! It *has* to be stable AND perfect!"
[2013-05-08 10:30:07] DavidScherer: Pity.
[2013-05-08 10:30:08] jimevans: adamgoucher: did you refactor the api in your bindings to not have to expose passing raw arrays? i always thought that was a huge code smell in the facebook version.
[2013-05-08 10:30:43] adamgoucher: jimevans: not really. of course, some of that nastiness is hidden from users in saunter :D
[2013-05-08 10:30:54] DavidScherer: Wait, so I would install the Selenium WebDriver on my machine and write the test code in PHP?
[2013-05-08 10:30:56] jleyba: jimevans: have you seen the dart webdriver bindings?

[2013-05-08 11:37:55] dimacus: Seuser: as compared to what?
[2013-05-08 11:38:27] Seuser: dimacus: In general WebDriver itself might have few limitations so can list out that.
[2013-05-08 11:38:41] llaskin: it's free, so because of that noone gets paid to work on it, so overall its a huge piece of crap.
[2013-05-08 11:38:49] llaskin: since nothing that is free is ever any good right?
[2013-05-08 11:39:08] detronizator: llaskin: at least the name is DOC
[2013-05-08 11:39:20] llaskin: DOC?

[2013-05-08 11:39:42] dimacus: Seuser: it does not handle browser events… like you cannot manipulate "save password" dialogs etc
[2013-05-08 11:39:46] detronizator: it's how Italian's brand good stuff
[2013-05-08 11:40:03] jimevans: Seuser: you'll need to be more specific. just asking for "disadvantages" isn't likely to get you very far. you'll need to specify what you want to compare against.
[2013-05-08 11:40:05] llaskin: aah ok detronizator sorta like chianti is properly labeled with the rooster if its real stuff, got it
[2013-05-08 11:40:09] Seuser: Not comparing to others. Or may be we can compare with RC ?
[2013-05-08 11:40:10] *llaskin trolls the trolls'
[2013-05-08 11:40:17] llaskin: Seuser: there is a great youtube on that

[2013-05-08 11:40:57] nirvdrum: barancev: I'd have to go through my logs, but it might be fixed now.  Let's close it out and I can re-open if it's still a problem.
[2013-05-08 11:41:21] jimevans: Seuser: and it's rather subjective also. webdriver does not have a concept of "page is loaded", while rc attempts to define one. some people call this a disadvantage. i don't.
[2013-05-08 11:41:38] dimacus: Seuser:  unlike say QTP you cannot test beautiful native java application
[2013-05-08 11:42:24] jimevans: dimacus: that's a disadvantage? i suppose if you're comparing apples to oranges.
[2013-05-08 11:42:37] *jimevans leaves the statement of "beautiful native java application" alone.'

[2013-05-08 11:43:11] lukeis: intellij is a java app?? wha
[2013-05-08 11:43:34] *lukeis stops using intellij'
[2013-05-08 11:43:44] Seuser: few ppl claim that.. webdriver works OS level - so why won't it support  handling browser dialogs...
[2013-05-08 11:43:45] jimevans: jleyba: eclipse? (yeah, i'm kidding here)
[2013-05-08 11:43:50] *jleyba wonders what IDE lukeis is going to use - eclipse?'
[2013-05-08 11:43:56] lukeis: vim!
[2013-05-08 11:44:14] dimacus: Seuser:  it works on os level to send things like click into the browser's DOM
[2013-05-08 11:44:25] dimacus: however, outside of a profile… you cannot control anythning
[2013-05-08 11:44:39] *jleyba uses vim and sublime text 2 for dynamic languages (js, python, etc)'

[2013-05-08 11:44:57] Seuser: alright... i understand..
[2013-05-08 11:45:16] dimacus: Seuser: there are a lot of advantages over paid versions
[2013-05-08 11:45:21] Seuser: any more points that be jotted down  ?
[2013-05-08 11:45:22] jleyba: Seuser: we call them "native" events b/c it's simpler.  The details are far trickier
[2013-05-08 11:45:49] dimacus: Seuser:  if something goes terribly wrong, you can't call many people and demand support… you have to bribe them with donuts
[2013-05-08 11:45:56] jleyba: when you want to type with chromedriver, it injects key events into the browser's rendering queue making it think the user pushed a physical key
[2013-05-08 11:46:01] Seuser: dimacus: yeah, i seen that. Right now, just searching on the dis advantages of WebDrver so that it will make us understand better.
[2013-05-08 11:47:31] qaguy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-05-08 11:47:38] dimacus: Seuser:  also… a lot of disadvantages you might find on say google… are actually browser issues (cough ie cough)
[2013-05-08 11:48:03] jimevans: dimacus: hey, it could just be that the IE driver is actually a piece of crap. :)
[2013-05-08 11:48:23] andreastt: barancev: We can indeed.  Let me sort out a new version tomorrow, is that fine?
[2013-05-08 11:48:43] jleyba: jimevans: don't sell yourself short.  I've needed to come up with FAR more IE-related workarounds with SeRC than IEDriver
[2013-05-08 11:48:49] barancev: andreastt: sure
[2013-05-08 11:48:54] dimacus: jimevans:  at the risk of offending the people who put in a lot of hard work on the actual code, i will not confirm nor deny that statment
[2013-05-08 11:49:00] barancev: but I think the release is soon

[2013-05-08 11:51:27] dimacus: jimevans:  touche… to be honest a lot of issues have gone away when i upgraded from RC...
[2013-05-08 11:51:35] andreastt: Ah okay.  Plenty of time then.
[2013-05-08 11:51:36] dimacus: i'm still chasing down the specifics
[2013-05-08 11:51:41] andreastt: Thanks for the head's up (-:
[2013-05-08 11:52:07] dimacus: jimevans: best solution is simple, full screen, mouse outside the window, and don't use RDP, use VNC
[2013-05-08 11:52:13] dimacus: that solves 90% of all issues

[2013-05-08 11:55:00] dimacus: i'd love to not use IE, but… things fall apart
[2013-05-08 11:55:02] barancev: not because IE is evil or IEDriver is bad, but because it is very sensitive to environment
[2013-05-08 11:55:20] dimacus: no a lot of the time it is the IE JS engine

[2013-05-08 12:33:27] AutomatedTester: gdennis: I think Simon wrote that from my initial code
[2013-05-08 12:33:30] AutomatedTester: I think
[2013-05-08 12:34:50] gdennis: in the absence of an optional coordinate (which appears to never be provided in current usages) it checks whether the center of the element is visible
[2013-05-08 12:35:22] AutomatedTester: centre?
[2013-05-08 12:35:27] jimevans: gdennis: if you say so.
[2013-05-08 12:36:16] gdennis: in he absense of the coordinate, I think it would make more sense to me if it checked whether the entire element were hidden
[2013-05-08 12:37:13] gdennis: I'm also not crazy about this being a public function at all -- but I see it's used directly by the IE driver
[2013-05-08 12:37:30] jimevans: gdennis: indeed it is.
[2013-05-08 12:38:20] jimevans: i think i may have even been the one to expose it. the IE driver needs to know if the center of the element is visible.
[2013-05-08 12:39:05] SamuraiJack, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-05-08 12:40:04] gdennis: if it were to be changed to so that it checks whether the entire element is hidden when a coordinate is not provided,  would the IE driver be able to provide the center argument itself?
[2013-05-08 12:40:30] jimevans: where "visible" means "currently within the viewport of the browser scrolled to be seen by the user, taking into account top-level document scroll position, containing frame/iframe(s) scroll position, and parent elements with the overflow style set to true"
[2013-05-08 12:42:41] jimevans: it'd be a major pain in the ass, but yeah, the driver could pass in the center coordinate.
[2013-05-08 12:43:42] jimevans: and i say that because it'd then require three round-trips through IE's already abysmally performing javascript engine.
[2013-05-08 12:43:47] jimevans: instead of just the one.
[2013-05-08 12:44:13] jost, quitting. (Quit: jost)
[2013-05-08 12:44:56] gdennis: alternatively, I could do a tri-state thing where an undefined coordinate means "center" and a null coordinate means "all of the element"
[2013-05-08 12:45:08] gdennis: or something like that
[2013-05-08 12:45:30] gdennis: anyway, sounds like I should avoid putting the driver though the rountrips :)
[2013-05-08 12:45:36] jimevans: gdennis: that's pretty ugly. fix it however you want. i'll adjust.
[2013-05-08 12:45:51] AutomatedTester: gdennis: isInParentOverflow looks out of date btw
[2013-05-08 12:46:13] Oscar, changing nick to Oscar_Rieken.
[2013-05-08 12:46:41] gdennis: AutomatedTester: there are two implementations of whether an element is hidden by overflow right now
[2013-05-08 12:46:51] AutomatedTester: gdennis: yup
[2013-05-08 12:46:57] brockfredin: jimevans You know the page object model?  Would you recommend creating automation tests for defects (that have been fixed) as a new file or put them within the appropriate page object file?
[2013-05-08 12:47:07] AutomatedTester: gdennis: the one in isShown is the canonical source as far as I am concerned
[2013-05-08 12:47:12] gdennis: one is in isShown (and I've been improving that internally at Google and will push out an improved version)
[2013-05-08 12:47:41] gdennis: these implementations should obviously be shared
[2013-05-08 12:48:18] gdennis: also, the isScrolledIntoView calculation is very similar, so I think there's room for even more code sharing there and further improvement
[2013-05-08 12:48:38] AutomatedTester: gdennis: definitely
[2013-05-08 12:48:46] jimevans: brockfredin: i'm not sure i understand. in my implementation, a page object wouldn't have test code in it, just code encapsulating business logic.
[2013-05-08 12:49:05] AutomatedTester: and we could probably save a little bit of effort by memoising the tree walking
[2013-05-08 12:49:33] jimevans: i'm not sure the IE driver can rely on the atoms for "is scrolled into view" calculation.
[2013-05-08 12:50:04] jimevans: the problem, near as i can tell, is that it'll break for cross-domain frames.
[2013-05-08 12:50:07] AutomatedTester: gdennis: also, as an FYI, I am working on a patch for isShown right now to do with elements being obscured
[2013-05-08 12:50:15] AutomatedTester: by other elements
[2013-05-08 12:50:53] jimevans: and while firefox and chrome may provide internal workarounds to allow that case to go through, we're limited by IE to not allow that.
[2013-05-08 12:51:05] gdennis: AutomatedTester: if you have any opinions about how to structure the "is element entirely hidden by overflow" vs "is this particular coordinate of element hidden by overflow" and how to make the "center of element" use case easy for the IE driver at the same time, let me know
[2013-05-08 12:52:09] AutomatedTester: gdennis: actually the patch that I am going to try do now will handle the "is the element entirely hidden"
[2013-05-08 12:52:53] gdennis: jimevans, AutomatedTester: I'm thinking about changing isScrolledIntoView to be confined to a single window and letting the caller walk up the window tree if and how it wants.
[2013-05-08 12:53:18] gdennis: all the other atom functions stay confined to a single window

[2013-05-08 13:22:52] jimevans: consider where element is a proper sub-element elem2. elementFromPoint() will give you the inner element, and we may want that. the parent element is still visible, even though it's "obscured" by its child element.

[2013-05-08 13:31:11] JasonN: hi, performance wise is findElement(By.Id) faster than findElement(By.Xpath) ?
[2013-05-08 13:31:22] AutomatedTester: JasonN: depends
[2013-05-08 13:31:27] jimevans: ah. okay. fair enough. i was going to simply suggest maybe looking to see if element.parentNode !== element2.parentNode.
[2013-05-08 13:31:43] AutomatedTester: jimevans: thats a good idea, I will try do that too
[2013-05-08 13:32:02] jimevans: which should eliminate the parent-child case. :)

[2013-05-08 13:32:47] jimevans: but i'll admit this kind of DOM querying isn't my strong suit. :)
[2013-05-08 13:33:21] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I know enough to be dangerous
[2013-05-08 13:33:47] JasonN: can you point out what is the advantage of using Xpath versus find element by attribute such as Id or ClassName
[2013-05-08 13:34:11] JasonN: AutomatedTester: can you point out what is the advantage of using Xpath versus find element by attribute such as Id or ClassName

[2013-05-08 13:34:55] AutomatedTester: JasonN: xpath is good when you can't use id or name
[2013-05-08 13:35:16] jimevans: JasonN: xpath can be more flexible. it can traverse the DOM to find relative elements. it can find elements based on textual content. but in general, finding by id or the name attribute *should* be more performant in most cases.
[2013-05-08 13:35:23] jimevans: there are exceptions, of course,
[2013-05-08 13:35:38] AutomatedTester: JasonN: but //*[@id='foo'] and id=foo are not going to be that different in lookup speed
[2013-05-08 13:36:04] jimevans: in IE, they probably are. particularly in IE < 9.
[2013-05-08 13:36:36] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I revert back to my "depends" answer ;)
[2013-05-08 13:36:40] jimevans: but IE is the outlier.
[2013-05-08 13:37:38] AutomatedTester: I did ask my MS contact to see if MS would add xpath to the browser. They said they hadnt because their copy of the internet showed very little use of it
[2013-05-08 13:37:45] AutomatedTester: not worth the person effort
[2013-05-08 13:38:09] AutomatedTester: which... to be fair is correct, no one really uses xpath in a browser these days
[2013-05-08 13:38:15] AutomatedTester: well except testers
[2013-05-08 13:38:34] jimevans: right.
[2013-05-08 13:38:56] AutomatedTester: we suggested that they correct this
[2013-05-08 13:39:15] JasonN: thank you for the answers
[2013-05-08 13:39:15] jimevans: i have much, much higher priorities of things i'd like to see from MSFT for supporting the IE driver before i want native xpath-over-html.
