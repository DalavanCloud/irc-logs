[2013-05-30 02:57:40] Chepra, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-30 02:58:06] Chepra: Hey there. Does the selenium-server uses other root-certificates than the standard firefox-profile?
[2013-05-30 02:58:41] andreastt: klad: Depends what browser you want to use, but generally if you want a real browser the trick is to start it in a xvfb session.
[2013-05-30 02:59:10] klad: I can start with firefox ... but ...
[2013-05-30 02:59:20] klad: I've tried to instal xvfb
[2013-05-30 02:59:36] klad: and ... ok give me a sec I'm pasting some error and warning

[2013-05-30 03:01:16] andreastt: Sounds like you're missing xfonts.
[2013-05-30 03:01:34] andreastt: Do a `sudo apt-get install xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi xfonts-scalable xfonts-cyrillic`.
[2013-05-30 03:01:58] klad: ok .. I think I did it .. but .. I'll try
[2013-05-30 03:02:09] klad: yep .. nothing happening
[2013-05-30 03:02:15] andreastt: Well, make sure you have the X server installed.
[2013-05-30 03:02:41] andreastt: Did you apt-get install xorg?
[2013-05-30 03:02:47] klad: ok I think I lack some knowledge here .. but is it necessary on a webserver ?
[2013-05-30 03:02:49] AutomatedTester: TIL I learnt ruby doesnt isnt installed by default on ubuntu
[2013-05-30 03:03:05] AutomatedTester: klad: on a webserver?
[2013-05-30 03:03:14] AutomatedTester: X isnt required there no
[2013-05-30 03:03:34] andreastt: klad: When running a browser in xvfb it's not actually running without window.  It's running the window in an X session hidden from the screen.
[2013-05-30 03:04:01] klad: ok perfect .. so I need to install it anyway
[2013-05-30 03:04:31] andreastt: Firefox won't run without X, no.
[2013-05-30 03:04:38] klad: installing
[2013-05-30 03:05:41] klad: ok .. now I'm starting with ...

[2013-05-30 03:06:08] klad: is it correct ?
[2013-05-30 03:06:17] Chepra: I dont understand how selenium started firefox handles ssl different than normal started firefox
[2013-05-30 03:06:24] andreastt: klad: Sure, that looks okay.

[2013-05-30 03:07:33] klad: nope .. it isn't
[2013-05-30 03:07:41] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Does firefox-bin support -display?  Or do you need to set DISPLAY?
[2013-05-30 03:07:53] AutomatedTester: you need DISPLAY

[2013-05-30 03:14:31] klad: ok so I just wrote ...
[2013-05-30 03:14:38] klad: export DISPLAY=:99
[2013-05-30 03:14:38] andreastt: It's an environmental variable to tell the X server to put it on screen number 99 on display server 0.

[2013-05-30 03:15:30] andreastt: Alternatively you can install xvfb-run and write a shell script to wrap the firefox binary.
[2013-05-30 03:15:31] klad: export DISPLAY=:99
[2013-05-30 03:15:36] andreastt: Which is perhaps the easist solution.

[2013-05-30 03:15:59] andreastt: Actually, you don't need a script at all.
[2013-05-30 03:16:13] andreastt: Just set firefox.bin (or whatever the capability is called) to "xvfb-run firefox".
[2013-05-30 03:16:28] AutomatedTester: andreastt: irl on ubuntu would be where

[2013-05-30 07:30:55] jds_: Hi there
[2013-05-30 07:31:41] jimevans: i'm wondering how you're getting marionette started with that (unless you have it enabled in your default profile, and/or there's a hidden -marionette switch on a command line somewhere)
[2013-05-30 07:31:46] jimevans: jds_: hi
[2013-05-30 07:32:01] barancev|2: AutomatedTester: does this mean that marionette is going to be compatible with selenium protocol?
[2013-05-30 07:32:19] barancev|2: you told it works over websockets instead of http
[2013-05-30 07:32:22] jimevans: (or alternatively, you're using a custom-built firefox.exe)
[2013-05-30 07:32:28] AutomatedTester: it doesnt use websockets
[2013-05-30 07:32:30] AutomatedTester: it uses tcp
[2013-05-30 07:32:40] barancev|2: oh! even worse
[2013-05-30 07:32:43] AutomatedTester: and there is a shim if you use the normal JSONWireProtocol
[2013-05-30 07:32:46] AutomatedTester: worse?
[2013-05-30 07:32:48] AutomatedTester: seriously?
[2013-05-30 07:33:03] AutomatedTester: http has a stupid amount of overhead that isnt useful on mobile
[2013-05-30 07:33:04] barancev|2: I'm thinking what we should rewrite in Java binding
[2013-05-30 07:34:06] barancev|2: and why Ruby sample works? it uses http too
[2013-05-30 07:34:29] jimevans: barancev|2: https://github.com/jimevans/MarionetteDriver.NET
[2013-05-30 07:34:45] jimevans: i suspect we'll do something similar in the other language bindings too.
[2013-05-30 07:34:53] AutomatedTester: barancev|2: thats using the shim
[2013-05-30 07:35:12] klad, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-05-30 07:35:16] barancev|2: jimevans: yes, I've seen this, but I wonder Ruby works out-of-the-box
[2013-05-30 07:35:30] jimevans: AutomatedTester: ah! that's the magic. you're using the shim. :)
[2013-05-30 07:35:46] AutomatedTester: notice how I am using remote
[2013-05-30 07:35:53] barancev|2: ah, interceptors...
[2013-05-30 07:35:58] jimevans: barancev|2: there's a shim that mozilla provides which acts like chromedriver.exe.
[2013-05-30 07:36:22] barancev|2: yes, a converter

[2013-05-30 07:36:51] selbot2___: AutomatedTester/Selenium-Proxy · GitHub: https://github.com/automatedtester/Selenium-Proxy
[2013-05-30 07:37:09] barancev|2: can we then follow the way of chromedriver and IEDriverServer?
[2013-05-30 07:37:24] AutomatedTester: what do you mean by that?
[2013-05-30 07:37:33] AutomatedTester: start the shim and then start the browser?
[2013-05-30 07:37:45] barancev|2: yes
[2013-05-30 07:37:49] jimevans: barancev2: you *could*, but it's implemented in python, which means that you need a python runtime installed, which means extra steps on windows.
[2013-05-30 07:38:29] AutomatedTester: you could but it will be more efficient to speak the protocol directly
[2013-05-30 07:38:32] AutomatedTester: just saying
[2013-05-30 07:39:37] jds_: I'm using the ruby version of selenium-webdriver.  If I visit a page with some asynchronously-loaded javascript on it, I can't interact with that page until the js has finished downloading, even though onready has already fired.
[2013-05-30 07:39:42] jds_: Is this a feature or a bug?
[2013-05-30 07:39:44] barancev|2: "efficient" in what measure?
[2013-05-30 07:40:29] barancev|2: is rewriting all bindings more "efficient"?
[2013-05-30 07:40:30] jimevans: anybody know if the remote debugging protocol for chrome is documented anywhere?
[2013-05-30 07:40:43] AutomatedTester: barancev|2: running them will be more efficient
[2013-05-30 07:41:10] AutomatedTester: barancev|2: I dont see how this is more contentious that some drivers using websockets and some using pure http
[2013-05-30 07:41:11] jimevans: barancev|2: almost any direct tcp communication is going to be more efficient than having an http stack in the middle.
[2013-05-30 07:41:16] barancev|2: what's speed improvement can I get from direct calls instead of a shim?

[2013-05-30 07:42:01] AutomatedTester: barancev|2: no shim ==  no need for the shim to process the request and then find the right mapping and then call the browser and then the same all the way back to the client
[2013-05-30 07:42:23] barancev|2: 1%? 10%?
[2013-05-30 07:42:34] AutomatedTester: I dont know
[2013-05-30 07:42:49] jimevans: barancev|2: nothing's stopping you from using the shim, you know.
[2013-05-30 07:42:58] jimevans: if you really want to, that is.
[2013-05-30 07:43:08] barancev|2: browser is slow, web is slow -- what's the deal to speedup the tests?
[2013-05-30 07:43:41] barancev|2: if I really care about the speed I can setup a grig and get X-times improvement
[2013-05-30 07:43:42] AutomatedTester: barancev|2: less processing code between browser and client code will make it faster no matter what

[2013-05-30 07:44:32] barancev|2: that's cool
[2013-05-30 07:44:36] AutomatedTester: barancev|2: a tcp client is much easier to implement that websockets
[2013-05-30 07:44:44] barancev|2: but... python...

[2013-05-30 08:24:35] Ardesco: does that mean 0.9 for different platforms have differing support?
[2013-05-30 08:24:38] Ardesco: ah

[2013-05-30 09:10:26] nirvdrum: I think freynaud does everything as a capability matcher.  He lets every request come in and then routes based on that.

[2013-05-30 09:15:05] nirvdrum: So overriding getNewSession is probably you're best bet.
[2013-05-30 09:17:38] jarib: then there's afterSession.. i will need to access the modified capabilities there as well. possible?

[2013-05-30 11:26:18] brockfredin: jimevans I am having this issue: penQA.Selenium.WebDriverException: Unexpected error. System.Net.WebException: Unable to connect to the remote server ---> System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused
[2013-05-30 11:27:11] brockfredin: But when I run echo from the command line it works fine on that build server.
[2013-05-30 11:27:27] jimevans: brockfredin: that means something's not running on the port you think it's running on, and you're trying to connect with it. that could be chromedriver.exe, iedriverserver.exe, the firefox webdriver extension, the java remote webdriver server, a strontium server, or anything else like that.
[2013-05-30 11:28:41] jimevans: could be that chromedriver.exe isn't getting launched properly, in that maybe it's not where your framework thinks it should be on the build server.
[2013-05-30 11:29:12] jimevans: (i'm assuming this is chrome. you seem to be beholden to testing with chrome a lot)
[2013-05-30 11:32:21] manoj9788: dimacus: Selenium  is under Apache license

[2013-05-30 11:34:33] simonstewart: That's pretty common
[2013-05-30 11:34:46] simonstewart: And it's one of the reasons we went with Apache 2
[2013-05-30 11:34:54] dimacus: yeah just want to get it over with and say… here you go it's on github
[2013-05-30 11:35:03] simonstewart: (Or rather, why one of the reasons I chose apache 2 for the original webdriver project)
[2013-05-30 11:35:15] simonstewart: The Source of Truth is the Google Code project
[2013-05-30 11:35:20] simonstewart: http://selenium.googlecode.com
[2013-05-30 11:35:29] simonstewart: That has the license information readily available

[2013-05-30 11:42:15] brockfredin: jimevans Yeah.  Thanks.  Just don't know why it runs via echo from the ocmmand line and not when it's told to by Jenkins.  Seems like everything is wrong with this.  Now I get: Unhandled Exception: OutOfMemoryException.
[2013-05-30 11:46:44] jimevans: brockfredin: probably different user contexts. jenkins frequently runs as a separate user, sometimes as a service. and running as a service is particularly problematic for the chromedriver
