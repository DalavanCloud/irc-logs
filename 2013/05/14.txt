[2013-05-14 07:10:53] jimevans: i'm looking at the IE10 tests in CI, and there have been some new failures that have sprung up recently.
[2013-05-14 07:11:20] jimevans: it may be something i broke in the IEDriverServer.exe code, during the couple of days dawagner was messing with the CI server
[2013-05-14 07:12:09] jimevans: then again, looking at the logs, it doesn't look like the failures happen right away either. in other words, the test case starts, then fails a good long while later, after many other tests have been run.
[2013-05-14 07:12:36] jimevans: of course, locally with IE10, everything works great.

[2013-05-14 08:20:22] Phasze: hmm, the only odd thing is that it only occurred on IE8
[2013-05-14 08:21:18] Ardesco: was anything else running at the same time as the IE8 tests?
[2013-05-14 08:21:32] Phasze: yes probably
[2013-05-14 08:21:44] Ardesco: bear in mind that IE8 is slow because it has a rubbish JS engine so all the other tests will most likely have completed whilst IE8 was still soldering along
[2013-05-14 08:21:49] Phasze: I have 2 concurrent tests that can be run from the IE8 machine

[2013-05-14 15:32:01] tmrhmd: Hello! I am about to start a large automation project involving hundreds of "tests" and still can't settle on a language to use. Currently, I am using Selenium with python and the experience so far has been good. I was considering if switching to Java would benefit with speed of the overall tests. I am aware that it will involve more typing due to Java's syntax but I can sacrifice that. So are there any other pros for using selenium with ja
[2013-05-14 15:32:40] tmrhmd: Oh BTW, I have very little experience with Java but willing to learn it
[2013-05-14 15:33:10] jimevans: tmrhmd: i'd be surprised if you saw any performance differences between language bindings.
[2013-05-14 15:33:54] barancev: the most low-performance part is the browser

[2013-05-14 15:57:02] nirvdrum: My guess is it had to do with thread safety.
[2013-05-14 15:58:17] barancev: it is just an *additional* log handler, as I see it
[2013-05-14 15:58:31] jimevans: something in javascript/atoms/test/dom_test.html is causing IE6 (6.00.3790.3959) to crash. this is *not* the version of IE6 from windows xp sp3. it's from windows server 2003 sp2, which is, of course, what we use in the CI environment.
[2013-05-14 15:59:33] jimevans: and i can't pull down our entire hosted version of the closure library to start hacking stuff out to see if i can fix the damned thing.

[2013-05-14 16:14:38] barancev: a vanilla new node is ~4M, each session adds ~3M (without logs!)
[2013-05-14 16:14:59] barancev: so the node can be really effective in memory use if we set logs off

The whole point of a grid is you're not really supposed to care what node you're running on anyway.  And if you really want to handle logs in a distributed environment, you should be centralizing the logging.
