[2013-05-02 06:39:33] Ardesco: In this case, the rifle was made by a company that sells guns specifically for children — “My first rifle” is the slogan — in colors ranging from plain brown to hot pink to orange to royal blue to multi-color swirls.

[2013-05-02 06:40:48] Oscar: its more the parents fault for not being responsible and locking the rifles up
[2013-05-02 06:40:52] Oscar: they are not toys
[2013-05-02 06:41:12] Ardesco: Nothing wrong with teaching kids to shoot in a properly supervised way

[2013-05-02 06:41:46] garndt: but it can come in multi-color swirls!

[2013-05-02 08:16:15] jimevans: it helps that .NET attributes (the equivalent of java's annotations) can be used multiple times for the same field or property, so you can define multiple FindBy-s for a single member. that attribute also supports a Priority field so that you can express which instance should be preferred in what order.

[2013-05-02 09:36:18] lukeis: that usually stems from an actual bug in your application, not matching the user agent header (they are slightly different for WebViews)… basically your app won't work as intended if someone links to it from facebook or twitter and the user is using those mobile apps

[2013-05-02 09:39:28] coreygriggs: do you know of a workaround to that?
[2013-05-02 09:39:51] coreygriggs: it's an edu app that's sold to schools so the linking on fb & twitter doesn't necessarily apply
[2013-05-02 09:40:33] lukeis: you can try using ios-driver  (but real device support isn't quite there)

[2013-05-02 14:42:54] stackedsax1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-02 14:42:54] lukeis: more correctly Mezmor is on 11.04 (right?)
[2013-05-02 14:43:05] jarib: that's odd. i'll take a look when i've figured out where the failure is coming from
[2013-05-02 14:43:36] lukeis: just seems very odd that the example works in python (with and without native events)
[2013-05-02 14:43:48] Dude-X: lukeis: dirty indeed. i prefer subclassing or composition
[2013-05-02 14:44:15] lukeis: i'm dirty with my python… because all my tests are written in java ;)
[2013-05-02 14:44:24] Dude-X: i feel your pain lukeis
[2013-05-02 14:44:25] jarib: lukeis: it's definitely a bug in the firefox driver. not sure why python isn't hitting that code path
[2013-05-02 14:44:28] jarib: let me link you to it
[2013-05-02 14:44:41] Dude-X: lukeis: but lately you're doing android, so i see why
[2013-05-02 14:44:49] lukeis: yes…..
[2013-05-02 14:44:52] Mezmor: 12.04 actually
[2013-05-02 14:45:10] jarib: lukeis: here's the problem: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/firefox-driver/js/firefoxDriver.js#L1377
[2013-05-02 14:45:24] jarib: being editable != having .value
[2013-05-02 14:45:46] brockfredin: You guys ever get crap for your Selenium runs failing?

[2013-05-02 14:47:45] Dude-X: but i got praise for making most of the tests stable
[2013-05-02 14:47:53] Dude-X: then i got pushed back to trying to make other tests stable

[2013-05-02 14:53:16] lukeis: jarib: i don't know why, but native events == false with same OS/FF but using python 2.32 and the send_keys works
[2013-05-02 14:54:50] jarib: can you log and :gist the wire resources you're hitting for the action chain?
[2013-05-02 14:54:50] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[2013-05-02 14:55:20] lukeis: jarib: i was reproducing it with just element.send_keys
[2013-05-02 14:55:25] jarib: that's the problem
[2013-05-02 14:55:39] jarib: that's a different code path
[2013-05-02 14:56:10] jarib: key_down(:shift) -> FirefoxDriver.prototype.sendKeysToActiveElement
[2013-05-02 14:57:08] lukeis: ah… python is the odd one out there then, cause it finds the active element first and then sends keys to it (doesn't use the /keys endpoint at all)
[2013-05-02 14:57:08] jarib: send_keys(:shift) -> WebElement.sendKeysToElement (in wrappedElement.js)
[2013-05-02 14:57:17] jarib: don't ask me why

[2013-05-02 14:57:57] jarib: that's not what python does AFAICT
[2013-05-02 14:57:59] lukeis: i don't know why the code paths differ there either
[2013-05-02 14:58:03] jarib: (if you use action chains)
[2013-05-02 14:58:40] jarib: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/py/selenium/webdriver/common/action_chains.py#L148
[2013-05-02 14:59:06] lukeis: yeah, shift is different… i'll try it ;)
[2013-05-02 14:59:08] lukeis: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/py/selenium/webdriver/common/action_chains.py#L240
[2013-05-02 14:59:17] lukeis: is everything else ;)
[2013-05-02 14:59:58] lukeis: key_down/up i meant
[2013-05-02 15:00:03] lukeis: ugh
[2013-05-02 15:00:03] jarib: yep
[2013-05-02 15:00:41] jarib: i commented on the issue. i'll take a quick look at the native events thing before bed
