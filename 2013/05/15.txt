[2013-05-15 05:26:19] adamgoucher: ok. so i've only been reading se-users and linkedin again for 3 days, but wow. i am actually amazed that a) the automation outsource industry exists/has survived if these are the level of questions b) that automation has as good a reputation as it does [as shit as it is]
[2013-05-15 05:27:02] Ardesco: not the only one
[2013-05-15 05:27:03] Ardesco: :)
[2013-05-15 05:31:05] RossPatterson: Indeed.  I have been wondering what a SeConf hosted in a country where the industry is dominated by outsourcing will be like.
[2013-05-15 05:31:20] RossPatterson: My mental picture is selenium-users but in person :-(
[2013-05-15 05:33:46] RossPatterson: Disgraced US President and de-frocked Quaker Richard Nixon often spoke of the "silent majority", a constituency he believed to exist and to back him.  I often think that automated testing is the same, only based in reality instead of fantasy.

[2013-05-15 10:32:27] diminoten: is there a way I can eval javascript in python without having to run it through a browser
[2013-05-15 10:32:36] stackedsax1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-15 10:32:48] jimevans: diminoten: in what respect? what do you want to do with it?
[2013-05-15 10:33:03] diminoten: there's a js object which contains a csrf value
[2013-05-15 10:33:17] diminoten: our app used to have it embedded in the HTML on one of the pages but the devs fixed that bug :(
[2013-05-15 10:33:32] diminoten: I want to pull the value out of the js object
[2013-05-15 10:34:11] jimevans: okay, what do you mean by "js object"? the object has to have a context. if it doesn't exist on the page, where is it?
[2013-05-15 10:34:22] diminoten: it does exist on the page
[2013-05-15 10:34:33] jimevans: then how do you expect to get access to it without a browser?
[2013-05-15 10:34:41] brettporter, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-15 10:34:59] diminoten: however the browser gets it
[2013-05-15 10:35:16] diminoten: I need just a small subset of the browser's capability
[2013-05-15 10:35:44] jimevans: how does the browser get it then? (i've no idea what csrf value is)
[2013-05-15 10:36:00] jimevans: is the object instantiated on the page by some javascript that's embedded in the page?
[2013-05-15 10:36:05] diminoten: yeah
[2013-05-15 10:36:16] stackedsax1, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2013-05-15 10:36:23] jimevans: so how does the javascript instantiate the object?
[2013-05-15 10:36:25] diminoten: the idea is that along with a session id you also use a CSRF token
[2013-05-15 10:36:33] diminoten: var object = new Thing()
[2013-05-15 10:36:44] diminoten: thing.csrf is what I want
[2013-05-15 10:37:38] lukeis: simonstewart is actually here? ;)  it's that time of the month again (FF just released another version) I don't know of anything that we're waiting for (opera driver has been updated)
[2013-05-15 10:37:40] jimevans: okay, but what's the context of "thing"? how does the javascript library get the information with which to construct the "thing" object?
[2013-05-15 10:37:41] plightbo, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-15 10:38:08] diminoten: it's a global var
[2013-05-15 10:38:36] diminoten: I think I see where you're going with this though
[2013-05-15 10:38:55] diminoten: the browser is given this token somehow
[2013-05-15 10:38:59] diminoten: by the server
[2013-05-15 10:39:15] diminoten: if I can mimic that behavior
[2013-05-15 10:39:23] diminoten: I don't actually need the JS itself
[2013-05-15 10:39:36] jimevans: i guess what i'm trying to get at here is that you have two choices. if there's some server-side process that would yield you the same data the javascript object uses to construct itself, you can use the same server-side process to get the data without using javascript. on the other hand, if the data is constructed entirely by the javascript logic, you *have* to have the page loaded to get it.
[2013-05-15 10:40:08] jimevans: and thus, you'd need the browser anyway, so don't resist it. :)
[2013-05-15 10:40:18] diminoten: it takes *forever* to get a browser up
[2013-05-15 10:40:23] diminoten: and it requires infrastructure
[2013-05-15 10:40:29] diminoten: etc etc
[2013-05-15 10:40:58] jimevans: no argument. that's what i'm trying to say. you probably don't need the javascript at all, just the data the javascript code uses to create the object on the page.

[2013-05-15 10:42:32] jimevans: if the data exists outside of the javascript code, don't rely on the javascript code to get the data.

[2013-05-15 11:51:08] sdog: lukeis:  I`m looking for rpm's .. so I can have them in a local repository and bootstrap machines with the full setup included ..
[2013-05-15 11:51:30] plightbo_work, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-15 11:51:51] cgoldberg: sdog, they aren't packaged officially as rpm's/deb's etc... some downstream people do them sometimes.. but like you saw.. out of date
[2013-05-15 11:52:15] sdog: cgoldberg:  exactly why I came here to see if somone knew some downstream version that was more recent :)
[2013-05-15 11:52:18] lukeis: I think most people usually create an image (with everything they want in the right place) and then install that image
[2013-05-15 11:52:37] jimevans: curl?
[2013-05-15 11:52:38] cgoldberg: sdog, i'm in the debian/ubuntu world... so i don't keep tabs on rpm's :)
[2013-05-15 11:53:00] sdog: lukeis:  It's not because a lot of people are  incompetent morons that don't understand how to deploy software at scale that I have to behave like one of them :)
[2013-05-15 11:53:27] barancev: ok, it seems to me that all drivers are ready to ship
[2013-05-15 11:53:36] cgoldberg: sdog, we package our own deb for Ubuntu
[2013-05-15 11:53:44] cgoldberg: we == my crew at work
[2013-05-15 11:53:47] lukeis: that's fine… then you'll likely need to have your own script to do the bootstrap (if you want the latest version of selenium)
[2013-05-15 11:54:13] sdog: cgoldberg:  which is what I`ll probably end up doing also ...  but it doesn't hurt to ask if someone already did the work :)
[2013-05-15 11:54:22] cgoldberg: sdog, totally
[2013-05-15 11:54:27] lukeis: or make an rpm :) (although I did not enjoy that experience when I did rpm building ~8 years ago)

[2013-05-15 12:00:47] cgoldberg: does php even have a packaging system?
[2013-05-15 12:00:49] jimevans: barancev: yeah, i'm telling you i need to add some synchronization code.
[2013-05-15 12:01:14] sdog: cgoldberg:  the sympony folks have composer which is as bad as any other packaging gimmic :)
[2013-05-15 12:01:22] barancev: so you'll be able to see the effect of changes on CI
[2013-05-15 12:01:52] cgoldberg: sdog..you can install latest python bindings from PyPI in your bootstrap.. that's all you need.  you could also store the tarball (from pypi) in a local branch and install from there (if for example your requirements don't allow you to install from pypi)
[2013-05-15 12:02:45] cgoldberg: sdog, selenium project *does* do proper Python packaging/release
[2013-05-15 12:02:49] jimevans: barancev: i know what's wrong.
[2013-05-15 12:02:50] cgoldberg: with *ever* release
