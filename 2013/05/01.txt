[2013-05-01 13:48:28] jimevans: it's a pretty simple fix for the IE driver, i think.
[2013-05-01 13:50:19] jimevans: there's even already a stub function in the submit command handler to check for the existence of a parent element.

[2013-05-01 14:28:07] jimevans: yeah, i'm watching it
[2013-05-01 14:28:28] jimevans: i don't think it's *old* IE, so much as *slow* IE.

[2013-05-01 14:29:32] jimevans: i'm pretty sure my change didn't cause that. it'll probably go away next time the test is run.
[2013-05-01 14:29:54] jimevans: i'll have to increase the timeout waiting for asynchronous javascript functions to run.

[2013-05-01 14:30:56] jimevans: i moved execution of the clear() atom to a different thread to handle the case where the onchange event of an input element fires an alert.

[2013-05-01 14:39:18] yappy_: KaibutsuX: because it's obvious by watching, that sending Keys.F5 doesn't refresh the page.
[2013-05-01 14:39:46] KaibutsuX: I'm pretty sure F5 is a browser level key, you can't catch that in the dom
[2013-05-01 14:40:29] yappy_: Well by observation, Keys.SHIFT, Keys.CONTROL, 'i' # Does not bring up chrome's console
[2013-05-01 14:40:39] KaibutsuX: again, browser level
[2013-05-01 14:40:42] yappy_: err control, shift i,  thats the order.
[2013-05-01 14:40:46] KaibutsuX: you're sending keys to an element, not the browser
[2013-05-01 14:40:51] yappy_: so how do I send keys to the browser ?
[2013-05-01 14:40:54] KaibutsuX: you can't
[2013-05-01 14:41:11] jimevans: yappy_: i'm not sure you can get there from here with chrom.
[2013-05-01 14:41:17] jimevans: or chrome even.
[2013-05-01 14:41:27] yappy_: so it's impossible to bring up the chrome console via webdriver ?
[2013-05-01 14:41:43] jimevans: mainly because of the way that the chrome driver processes keystrokes.
[2013-05-01 14:41:56] KaibutsuX: I don't think it's possible, but even if you could, it's not possible to interact with it
[2013-05-01 14:42:05] yappy_: ok.  If that's the correct answer so be it.  Do you have documentation to explain this?

[2013-05-01 14:42:41] jimevans: but maybe there's an alternative way to accomplish what you want.
[2013-05-01 14:42:47] KaibutsuX: yappy_: you can't screenshot the console anyway, screenshot only taks a pic of the dom canvas
[2013-05-01 14:42:52] jimevans: why do you want to take a screenshot of the console?
[2013-05-01 14:43:05] yappy_: yeah or read it's contents.
[2013-05-01 14:43:11] lukeis: driver.page_source
[2013-05-01 14:43:13] jimevans: and KaibutsuX is right, you won't be able to screenshot the console with webdriver.
[2013-05-01 14:43:48] KaibutsuX: yappy_: it's a good idea, personally I wish there was a way I could run my tests, and dump all the warnings from a browser's console to a file or something
[2013-05-01 14:43:55] lukeis: driver.page_source > some fancy imagemagic command… voila, screenshot of the source code ;)
[2013-05-01 14:44:20] KaibutsuX: lukeis: but page_source is interpreted from the DOM, so not necessarily the actual source
[2013-05-01 14:44:24] *lukeis no clue what that would be useful for'
[2013-05-01 14:44:36] jimevans: if chromedriver.exe implemented the logging commands, it might be able to give that to you, but i don't know if it does or if it will.
[2013-05-01 14:44:43] lukeis: the inspectors only show the interpretations too

[2013-05-01 14:46:20] KaibutsuX: oh you were referring to your own imagemagic thing, nm

[2013-05-01 16:05:39] Dude-X: firefox was suppose to have a feature to allow multiple browsers to support native events without requiring active focus
[2013-05-01 16:06:00] KaibutsuX: we just got our new VM set up and I'm testing 8 simultaneous test nodes
[2013-05-01 16:06:11] KaibutsuX: but we turn nativeEvents off right now
[2013-05-01 16:07:29] Dude-X: oh it's better that way until you need it
[2013-05-01 16:07:31] KaibutsuX: eventually we'll want them back on so we can do some of our UI testing for mouseovers, but seems like something that might get affected in concurrent tests
[2013-05-01 16:08:02] KaibutsuX: yeah I know, turning off was a real life saver, especially before I cleaned up a ton of bad html and js
