[2013-05-17 03:13:08] AutomatedTester: Phil37: no...
[2013-05-17 03:13:40] AutomatedTester: I have never had to integrate with Enterprise crap, I  mean software
[2013-05-17 03:14:04] Phil37: the acronym summons ellipses
[2013-05-17 03:14:07] p_l: AutomatedTester: it starts with "Rational" in name, it must be crap
[2013-05-17 03:17:10] barancev: Rational Rose was an awesome product

[2013-05-17 03:17:35] AutomatedTester: red and white blend?
[2013-05-17 03:17:43] barancev: it's a UML designer
[2013-05-17 03:17:50] barancev: it was Rational, not IBM, those days
[2013-05-17 03:18:02] AutomatedTester: do people really use UML
[2013-05-17 03:18:12] AutomatedTester: I thought that was only for teaching in university
[2013-05-17 03:18:49] barancev: it's quite usable to reverse-engineeer a big pile of code and investigate class diagramm, in addition to read the code
[2013-05-17 03:19:44] barancev: for those who likes "visualizations"
[2013-05-17 03:19:49] Ardesco: used www.plantuml.com to show data flows between systems at last gig

[2013-05-17 03:20:30] p_l: as long as no one gets the bright idea to keep 1:1 mapping between diagram and code
[2013-05-17 03:21:05] barancev: p_l: what's the problem with mapping?
[2013-05-17 03:21:22] barancev: you change the code, tools redraws the diagram, bingo!
[2013-05-17 03:21:58] Ardesco: the diagram was created by the test code, so you could see what was being sent where
[2013-05-17 03:22:07] Ardesco: was quite useful actuall
[2013-05-17 03:22:13] plightbo, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-17 03:22:18] Ardesco: easier than trawling through log files for send/acks
[2013-05-17 03:22:24] p_l: barancev: it's often abused (or leads to too verbose diagrams)
[2013-05-17 03:22:31] p_l: not to mention that not everything maps to class diagrams
[2013-05-17 03:22:40] p_l: class diagrams are the least useful from UML, to me
[2013-05-17 03:22:51] barancev: yes, there is nothing that can picture "everythons", so what?
[2013-05-17 03:22:59] barancev: every model is just a model
[2013-05-17 03:23:26] barancev: these days I use IDEA, they generate nice looking class diagrams
[2013-05-17 03:23:47] barancev: but theis layout engine is worse that Rose's

[2013-05-17 08:36:11] jimevans: klepikovm: my general policy for the IE driver is that anything that can't be isolated to a single "session" shouldn't be implemented. but i suppose i could be convinced otherwise.

We can talk about making it "more optional" of course, as part of the review.

[2013-05-17 08:53:55] Ardesco: easy enough to roll it out if something does go wrong
[2013-05-17 08:54:56] barancev: svg in 2.32? really?
[2013-05-17 08:55:05] zac_sel: some bits of it
[2013-05-17 08:55:08] jimevans: Ardesco: i suppose that's true. for all the code churn, it's really about three lines inside InputManager::PerformInputSequence() that is affected.
[2013-05-17 08:55:09] zac_sel: I can click elements now
[2013-05-17 08:55:22] barancev: btw, AutomatedTester, we still have svg tests broken in FF10 and 17 :)
[2013-05-17 08:56:57] jimevans: zac_sel: we added some fixes for svg in IE in 2.32.0.1 of IEDriverServer.exe too.
[2013-05-17 08:57:07] jimevans: don't know if you care about IE or not.
[2013-05-17 08:57:47] zac_sel: well you know who I work for, but that is cool to have solid support across other browsers :)

[2013-05-17 09:50:07] jimevans: lukeis: you have two options, take a lump sum cash disbursement up front (that's the $376M figure), or take the full amount disbursed annually over 30 years.
[2013-05-17 09:50:47] lukeis: that's definitely what I would do if I got it… just right off the bat say all my family split the ticket, then I wouldn't have to deal with trying to disburse it amongst them later...

[2013-05-17 13:30:47] Ardesco_Home: initial run did this:

[2013-05-17 13:31:11] Ardesco_Home: so i think i need to get in that box and find out whats happening
[2013-05-17 13:31:17] jimevans: ok. fair enough.
[2013-05-17 13:31:24] Ardesco_Home: i suspect so,mething wierd has happened
[2013-05-17 13:31:34] Ardesco_Home: i can't access it again until monday though
[2013-05-17 13:32:03] Ardesco_Home: actually maybe i can
[2013-05-17 13:32:08] jimevans: don't give it too much thought til then. sounds like i didn't screw things up too badly. though the hover test failure disturbs me.
[2013-05-17 13:32:16] Ardesco_Home: i'll see what i can get out of it and let you know
[2013-05-17 13:32:26] Ardesco_Home: well IE8 is slow
[2013-05-17 13:32:28] jimevans: thanks, mate.
[2013-05-17 13:32:39] Ardesco_Home: may just be i need to extend a timeout
[2013-05-17 13:32:41] jimevans: is this a test that occasionally fails on IE8 normally?
[2013-05-17 13:32:50] Ardesco_Home: normally they are rock solid
[2013-05-17 13:33:01] jimevans: well, i am worried now.
[2013-05-17 13:33:12] Ardesco_Home: the main problem we have is occasionally we get a timeout loading a library from google which breaks everything
[2013-05-17 13:33:12] jimevans: but i can certainly wait until monday
[2013-05-17 13:33:19] Scoding: I was wondering guys, how would I select a form by it's index(lets say there are 3 forms on the page, and I want to interact with second form) and then interact with it's elements?
[2013-05-17 13:33:20] Ardesco_Home: or google maps autocomplete doesn't return
[2013-05-17 13:33:24] jimevans: gotcha
[2013-05-17 13:33:31] Ardesco_Home: we think thats because we don't have a paid for API key yet
[2013-05-17 13:33:38] Ardesco_Home: (only been asking for that since october)
[2013-05-17 13:34:06] Scoding: I'm using
[2013-05-17 13:34:07] Scoding: $form_check = $this->session->element("css selector","form:nth-child(".($form_id).")")->displayed();
[2013-05-17 13:34:08] jimevans: Scoding: how about driver.findElements(By.tagName("form")).get(1); (or the equivalent thereof in the language you're using)
[2013-05-17 13:34:24] Scoding: but if theres only one form, that messes up
[2013-05-17 13:34:24] Ardesco_Home: anyway i'll try get something more useful for you
[2013-05-17 13:34:25] Scoding: Hmm
[2013-05-17 13:34:35] Ardesco_Home: i'll kick IE8 off again and see if it fails in the same place
[2013-05-17 13:34:54] Ardesco_Home: entirely possible it was just a glitch
[2013-05-17 13:34:54] jimevans: Ardesco_Home: whatever help you give would be useful, i'm sure.
[2013-05-17 13:35:20] jimevans: we shall see.
