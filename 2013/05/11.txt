[2013-05-11 01:26:28] andreastt: I assume you'd pass an instance of that into FirefoxDriver's constructor.

[2013-05-11 01:43:21] trandatnh: andreastt: many thanks. I found it. You're correct, we can set the profile in FireFoxDriver's contructor as: FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile(new File("\\locationto\\uibpc5wf.selenium"));
[2013-05-11 01:43:22] trandatnh: 	WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(profile);

[2013-05-11 02:54:34] trandatnh: I don't know is there any performance decrease if I execute js?
[2013-05-11 02:56:07] trandatnh: bayandin: how to make sure page has changed after a click?
[2013-05-11 02:56:30] trandatnh: bayandin: I want to wait untill the page is loaded after click a button
[2013-05-11 02:57:07] trandatnh: bayandin: current my code just running forward without caring about what the current page is
[2013-05-11 02:59:31] bayandin: trandatnh: you may use implicit wait and dont worry about page loaded
[2013-05-11 02:59:40] trandatnh: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
[2013-05-11 02:59:47] bayandin: yep
[2013-05-11 02:59:56] trandatnh: I'm using this one... but it doesn't work as my expectation
[2013-05-11 02:59:57] trandatnh: :(
[2013-05-11 03:00:11] trandatnh: yep, it works with findElement
[2013-05-11 03:00:30] trandatnh: Select select = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id(ticketType)));
[2013-05-11 03:00:50] trandatnh: I don't know it will wait for this statment or not...
[2013-05-11 03:00:54] trandatnh: bayandin:
[2013-05-11 03:01:42] bayandin: Actually, WebDriver automatically waits for the page to load
[2013-05-11 03:02:32] trandatnh: hmm I tried 2 times, while debugging, everything works fine
[2013-05-11 03:02:42] robpark, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-11 03:02:44] trandatnh: without debug, it runs without caring the page load

[2013-05-11 03:04:06] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-11 03:04:33] trandatnh: bayandin: If I do add driver.findElement(By.id(ticketType)); before Select select = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id(ticketType))); then WebDriver will wait
[2013-05-11 03:05:19] bayandin: trandatnh: what happens after click a button? JS load new data or new page loading?
[2013-05-11 03:05:35] trandatnh: new page loading
[2013-05-11 03:07:06] trandatnh: it looks like a bug? if I write driver.findElement(By.id("ibtnNext")), WebDriver will wait.

[2013-05-11 03:07:35] trandatnh: bayandin: but with driver.findElement(By.id("ibtnNext")).click() , WebDriver will not wait
[2013-05-11 03:10:05] bayandin: Try to split into 2 part your function: 1. find element and store it, 2. click on element
[2013-05-11 03:10:53] trandatnh: bayandin: yes I did. It makes WebDriver to wait.
[2013-05-11 03:11:35] trandatnh: IMO both of the implement should work in the same way

[2013-05-11 03:17:17] trandatnh: bayandin: oh, let me check :)
[2013-05-11 03:17:30] trandatnh: bayandin: thanks for your information
[2013-05-11 03:19:18] trandatnh: bayandin: so in case new page will be loaded after a click
[2013-05-11 03:19:27] trandatnh: bayandin: then I need to check myself?
[2013-05-11 03:20:37] trandatnh: bayandin: in that case, which method should I use to check ?

[2013-05-11 03:22:29] trandatnh: I will click another button
[2013-05-11 03:22:49] trandatnh: bayandin: or I will select an option
[2013-05-11 03:23:25] bayandin: by click?
[2013-05-11 03:24:20] trandatnh: bayandin: yes, for select I use the class Select
[2013-05-11 03:24:28] bayandin: trandatnh: by click?
[2013-05-11 03:24:29] trandatnh: bayandin: Select select = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id(ticketType)));
[2013-05-11 03:25:16] bayandin: trandatnh: again split into 2 part: find element and action with it
[2013-05-11 03:25:50] trandatnh: bayandin: ok let me try.. I'm doing the same but something's wrong here...

[2013-05-11 04:37:57] bpietro: hi, I'm Selenium newbie and maybe for this reason I can see little (IMHO) slips. A little suggestion to Selenium GUI designer: Principle of least astonishment - People are part of the system. The design should match the user's experience, expectations, and mental models.(Saltzer, J. H.; Kaashoek, Frans (2009). Principles of computer system design: an introduction) I was surprised seeing velocity regulator ranging from Fast(left) to Slow(right). Daily
[2013-05-11 04:37:58] bpietro: experience teached me exact contrary. Have you ever seen e.g. speedometer in the car ranging from 160 mph (on the left) to 0 (on the right)? Or download status "termometer" growing from the right to the left? IMHO the element would be inverted (from Slow at the left to the Fast at the right). My 5 cents :)
