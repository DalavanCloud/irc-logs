[2013-05-10 06:07:09] Dude-X_: it's just a limitation of the language when it comes to foreign words

[2013-05-10 07:58:05] RexButler: I'm having frame issues (StaleElementReferenceException) ...
[2013-05-10 07:58:39] RexButler: now I am calling the Select.deselectAll() method which seems to be the trouble
[2013-05-10 07:58:51] freynaud, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-10 07:59:03] Ardesco: Sounds like the elements have changed since they were originally found
[2013-05-10 07:59:11] Ardesco: you'kk have to reinstanciate the select object
[2013-05-10 07:59:23] RexButler: because if I comment out that call, the problem goes away and the code acts as usual except the select isn't cleared
[2013-05-10 08:00:30] RexButler: So a Select must be reinstantiated after a deselectAll() call?  That would probably explain it
[2013-05-10 08:01:32] Ardesco: no it needs to be reinstantiated if the elements in the dom have been destroyed and recreated
[2013-05-10 08:01:40] freynaud, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2013-05-10 08:02:07] Ardesco: a StaleElementReferenceException means that the reference to the WebElement you had is no longer correct
[2013-05-10 08:02:10] Ardesco: i.e. it is stale
[2013-05-10 08:02:15] RexButler: BTW, I posted this question on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16473377/selenium-issue-select-deselectall-causing-iframe-issues
[2013-05-10 08:02:19] Ardesco: so you have to find the element you want to interact with again
[2013-05-10 08:02:35] RexButler: Hmm...
[2013-05-10 08:02:37] Ardesco: this is usually cause by a DOM refresh that has destroyed and then recreate the original element
[2013-05-10 08:03:07] RexButler: That makes sense
[2013-05-10 08:04:25] RexButler: However if I comment out the deselectAll() method the rest of the code works
[2013-05-10 08:04:32] Ardesco: so basically find the select element again before performing a deselectALl
[2013-05-10 08:04:53] RexButler: Oh okay
[2013-05-10 08:05:13] Ardesco: I suspect if you change the deselectAll call to another call that interacts with the select you will still see a StaleElementReferenceExcpetion
[2013-05-10 08:05:29] Ardesco: I'd guess that whatever you do before the deselect all is the cause
[2013-05-10 08:05:51] RexButler: Wonderful, I'll look at the code

[2013-05-10 08:29:01] Ardesco: foenix: I don't see an obvious reason for the problem, I would suggest checking to see if the element exists and is visible
[2013-05-10 08:29:22] Ardesco: my guess would be that you need an explicit wait because PhantomJS is going too quickly

[2013-05-10 08:32:07] Ardesco: yup RexButler
[2013-05-10 08:32:38] JasonN, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-10 08:32:48] Ardesco: It could be that the click is happening before the listener is registered, or it's just not triggering the listener for some reason
[2013-05-10 08:33:07] Ardesco: if this is the case you could try to explicitly trigger the event you are expecting

[2013-05-10 08:38:24] RexButler: essentially?
[2013-05-10 08:38:42] Ardesco: A By object is a way to find an element
[2013-05-10 08:38:51] Ardesco: a WebElement is a reference to an element in the DOM
[2013-05-10 08:39:18] RexButler: Yes OC
[2013-05-10 08:40:00] jimevans: eranm: do you happen to remember a hover issue in IE where a hover wasn't being displayed unless you pointed to the actual text in an element, instead of just the center of an element (like a block element)?
[2013-05-10 08:40:30] Ardesco: I've seen that jimevans, but the issues was reproducible manually
[2013-05-10 08:40:42] Ardesco: to get round that in our test framework we added a jiggle
[2013-05-10 08:41:12] Ardesco: case "internet explorer":
[2013-05-10 08:41:13] Ardesco:                 performAction.moveToElement(cellToHoverOver, 1, 1).perform()
[2013-05-10 08:41:14] Ardesco:                 performAction.moveToElement(cellToHoverOver).perform()
[2013-05-10 08:41:51] jimevans: Ardesco: yeah, but there was some code added to the IE driver to try to detect this scenario and work around it for  you.

[2013-05-10 08:46:36] jimevans: eranm: but i was wondering if we had a test that displayed the issue.
[2013-05-10 08:47:05] jimevans: because i just refactored some of the mouse move code in the IE driver, but only have an IE10 environment to test against locally
[2013-05-10 08:47:06] eranm: I'll have to go back and check, nothing off the top of my head
[2013-05-10 08:48:20] jimevans: and what i'm afraid of is that it only manifests in older IE versions.

Its a very simple test, it fills in a form and clicks a button. This webform submission is all done in ajax. Everything goes smoothly until I click the submit button - nothing happens.
[2013-05-10 12:24:42] cozby: The element is there
[2013-05-10 12:24:56] cozby: I'm not getting an error regarding the element not being present
[2013-05-10 12:25:05] cozby: however it just timesout

[2013-05-10 13:33:46] nullx: jimevans: I see, so I'd have to implement a basic proxy that logs the transaction

[2013-05-10 22:50:09] trandatnh: WebElement has methods sendKey, is there any issue if the webdriver lose focus?
[2013-05-10 22:55:55] andreastt: There may be, depending on the browser.
[2013-05-10 22:56:07] andreastt: Some browsers require focus on some OSes.
[2013-05-10 22:56:23] trandatnh: I'm using firefox
[2013-05-10 22:57:02] andreastt: I don't think Firefox should have this problem.
[2013-05-10 22:57:11] trandatnh: I have used MSHTML and it supports some DOM function like, setAttribute
[2013-05-10 22:57:18] trandatnh: getAttribute
[2013-05-10 22:57:23] stephend: on linux it might
[2013-05-10 22:57:28] stephend: have problems with firefox, that is
[2013-05-10 22:57:41] stephend: there have been weird focus-manager window issues in linux
[2013-05-10 22:57:45] trandatnh: WebDriver provies select by id but I don't see setAtrribut
[2013-05-10 22:57:50] trandatnh: setAttribute*
[2013-05-10 22:58:15] trandatnh: hmmm
[2013-05-10 22:58:17] andreastt: stephend: I see, I didn't think it had such a limitation.
[2013-05-10 22:58:35] stephend: well, not 100% sure
[2013-05-10 22:58:37] ShawnM, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-10 22:58:37] andreastt: trandatnh: WebDriver isn't a DOM manipulation library.
[2013-05-10 22:58:53] andreastt: stephend: Neither am I (-:
[2013-05-10 22:59:07] trandatnh: Since WebDriver can inject js, why don't we support js for setAttribute?
[2013-05-10 22:59:26] andreastt: trandatnh: So to set an attribute, you could call executeScript() to inject a blob of arbitrary JS into the browser.
[2013-05-10 22:59:53] andreastt: Because supporting setAttribute, traversal, DOM manipulation, and so on would be a serious feature creep (-:
[2013-05-10 23:00:38] andreastt: Other libraries are more suited to do those things.
[2013-05-10 23:01:01] trandatnh: andreastt: ok... I will manage it with js
[2013-05-10 23:01:32] trandatnh: anyway, I'm new to java too :) do I need to create main for every class :D
[2013-05-10 23:02:43] andreastt: You only need a main function if you want your program to be executable from command-line.
[2013-05-10 23:03:16] ShawnM, quitting. (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[2013-05-10 23:03:27] andreastt: You can have none or more main functions in your program depending on how many access points you need.
[2013-05-10 23:04:01] trandatnh: andreastt: great! that's why I can't run my class in command-line.
[2013-05-10 23:04:33] trandatnh: anyway, I want to check whether an input is present or not. which function should I use?
[2013-05-10 23:05:18] andreastt: Like an element is present, or that a text in an input field is present?
[2013-05-10 23:06:31] trandatnh: element Id
[2013-05-10 23:07:05] trandatnh: just want to check whether the element id is present or not. like after login the password id should disappear
[2013-05-10 23:07:55] stephend, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-05-10 23:09:42] andreastt: I'd probably ask WebDriver to fetch a list of all elements with that ID and check the length of that list.
[2013-05-10 23:10:00] andreastt: Like driver.findElements(By.id("foobar")).length()
[2013-05-10 23:10:35] trandatnh: I have seen somewhere that ppl use funtion assert*
[2013-05-10 23:11:02] andreastt: Sorry, size().
[2013-05-10 23:11:22] trandatnh: that's cool ^^

[2013-05-10 23:17:31] andreastt: You might have to employ some more techniques if elements on your page is loaded asynchronously, and so forth.
[2013-05-10 23:19:21] andreastt: If using Java to write tests, you should look at JUnit for assertions.
