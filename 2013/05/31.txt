[2013-05-31 02:30:43] Seuser: hi all
[2013-05-31 02:30:54] Seuser: a doubt regarding the xpath
[2013-05-31 02:31:28] Seuser: my xpath looks like this - //div[@id='1233']/div/span[2]/span and the id changes dynamically everytime... so this is not working.
[2013-05-31 02:32:06] Seuser: Can any one help in fixing this. I think it can be solved by regex ? - If yes, can some one help me with that ?
[2013-05-31 02:33:25] AutomatedTester: Seuser: is that the best locator you can come up with?
[2013-05-31 02:33:52] Ardesco: if you have a problem and solve it with regex, you probably now have 2 problems :)
[2013-05-31 02:34:04] Ardesco: keep regex in it's box unless you really have to
[2013-05-31 02:36:00] Seuser: AutomatedTester: yes that is the xpath that I can get through the source.
[2013-05-31 02:36:08] AutomatedTester: a
[2013-05-31 02:36:46] Ardesco: Seuser: can you show us the source
[2013-05-31 02:36:46] AutomatedTester: Seuser: the right thing to do is ask your developers if they can add something for you to use as that xpath is going to be very brittle
[2013-05-31 02:37:13] AutomatedTester: Seuser: baring that you need to see if the id has something common in it but still makes it unique
[2013-05-31 02:37:48] AutomatedTester: and do something like //div[contains(@id,'uniquePartOfTheId']/div/span[2]/span
[2013-05-31 02:38:06] AutomatedTester: but that is still very brittle and will make adults cry like children
[2013-05-31 02:41:02] Seuser: i tried to capture the source of that element alone... hope that is sufficient to analyze.
[2013-05-31 02:41:02] Seuser: http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=vhaqg2&s=5
[2013-05-31 02:41:56] Phil37:  //span[@title='Edit Settings'] ?
[2013-05-31 02:42:07] AutomatedTester: what Phil37 said
[2013-05-31 02:42:52] Seuser: the problem is I have one more attribute with title as Edit Settings but with different span
[2013-05-31 02:44:51] Phil37: you can stick an index on the end of it, like //span[@title='Edit Settings'][3] for the third span node that matches
[2013-05-31 02:44:54] Phil37: i think
[2013-05-31 02:48:44] jamesoram, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-05-31 02:48:45] Seuser: ahh ok but again adding the index wont be brittle ?

[2013-05-31 02:50:29] Seuser: AutomatedTester phil37 Wont this be brittle - ? //span[@title='Edit Settings'][3]
[2013-05-31 02:51:02] AutomatedTester: Seuser: a lot less brittle than your original one but the right thing to do is fix the html to make the element unique
[2013-05-31 02:51:14] Seuser: ok...
[2013-05-31 02:52:05] vitsaus: AutomatedTester: i was wondering that for a while :)

[2013-05-31 09:28:49] andreastt: I just had a test (which is phenomenally badly written) delete the entire build it's testing.  That is, it deleted itself during runtime.
[2013-05-31 09:29:07] andreastt: jimevans: I betcha even IE doesn't do that!
[2013-05-31 09:29:53] jimevans: andreastt: i bow to your superior test writing skillz. :)
[2013-05-31 09:29:57] andreastt: As it turns out, this caused some… shall we say interesting Python problems.

[2013-05-31 09:31:01] andreastt: Apparently there should be a check for whether the build your running exists before each test.
[2013-05-31 09:31:05] jimevans: very true, that.
[2013-05-31 09:31:06] andreastt: Might be someone deleted it!
[2013-05-31 09:31:27] andreastt: Of course, the test is also horrible in more than one way.
[2013-05-31 09:31:43] andreastt: Turns out it's not thread-safe in any form, way, or fashion.
[2013-05-31 09:31:54] andreastt: So it sits on an external HTTP server, and is written in PHP.

[2013-05-31 10:07:07] jytvp: Had a quick question: Using Saucelabs & PHPUnit, and I'm getting an error testing our app on IE9/10: " The point at which the driver is attempting to click on the element was not scrolled into the viewport" ... elementScrollBehavior is 1, and requireWindowFocus is true.
[2013-05-31 10:07:34] jytvp: Not sure where to go with this one, so any help is appreciated! In the saucelabs video, the element is actually not visible on screen; it looks like it's being covered up by the windows taskbar or something.
[2013-05-31 10:07:38] smccarthy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-31 10:10:26] jimevans: jytvp: so the IE driver attempts to call the equivalent of the javascript "scrollIntoView()" function on the element. if you're using the php equivalent of the click() method on the element, the driver is trying to click on the center of the element. if that center can't be brought into the viewport, the driver tries to calculate the center of the visible portion of the element. if the element can't be brought into the viewport at all, it can't be clic
[2013-05-31 10:11:47] jytvp: jimevans: That's interesting. So if I'm understanding correctly... at this point, it means that either the page isn't scrollable with javascript, or the element isn't visible on screen?
[2013-05-31 10:11:49] jimevans: the question is, if the element isn't in the viewport, how would the user click on it? this is especially important with requireWindowFocus
[2013-05-31 10:12:01] jytvp: right
[2013-05-31 10:13:12] jytvp: okay; i'm going to mess with our implementation a bit and see if i can't fix this some other way. thank you! Super helpful to know (even a little) more about how the drivers are actually working :D

[2013-05-31 12:57:15] jimevans: because you *can't* build a windows 8 phone app in a VM.

[2013-05-31 12:57:38] jimevans: you *have* to be running bare metal. and the sdk *only* installs on windows 8.
[2013-05-31 12:58:51] jimevans: and if you're asking "why do you want to build windows 8 phone apps," it's the only hope in hell of getting the IE driver to work on IE mobile platforms.
