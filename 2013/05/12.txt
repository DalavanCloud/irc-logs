[2013-05-12 07:49:48] nullx: Nah, this is still timers
[2013-05-12 07:50:05] nullx: I would just get the time, do the action, wait for page load, then get the time again.. subtract the difference
[2013-05-12 07:50:14] nullx: you said Python?
[2013-05-12 07:51:15] nullx: I believe you need to do time() from the time module or whatever
[2013-05-12 07:51:41] nullx: or clock() not sure, there seems to be a difference based on OS on how accurate they are
