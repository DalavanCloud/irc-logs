[2013-05-27 04:44:33] Nyris: i am trying to test picture upload with webdriver and Ruby on rails app..any tips how can i make the reference to the photo relatvie to rails directory ?
[2013-05-27 04:46:08] jarib: Nyris: you mean the path on disk?
[2013-05-27 04:47:08] jarib: perhaps something like driver.find_element(...).send_keys Rails.root.join('public/images/your-photo.png')
[2013-05-27 04:47:17] jarib: (depends on how your tests are set up)
[2013-05-27 04:47:55] Nyris: jarib when i use Rails.root. the test fails with a complain " NameError:   uninitialized constant Rails"
[2013-05-27 04:49:53] jarib: ok, so then you're not running this test inside rails
[2013-05-27 04:50:14] Nyris: i am, it's inside Spec/features
[2013-05-27 04:50:46] jarib: but rails itself is not loaded inside the test
[2013-05-27 04:50:50] jarib: which is good, if you can avoid it
[2013-05-27 04:52:42] jarib: so you just need to make a constant yourself, relative to one of the loaded files - e.g. APP_ROOT = File.expand_path("../../../..", __FILE__) inside spec/features/support/env.rb (or what have you)
[2013-05-27 04:54:23] Nyris: I see... i will try to do that, i am still new to this, but i will do some research ...

[2013-05-27 05:16:54] chriskak: We're extending things like PageFactory and are looking for a good way to unit test it without pointing Selenium at an external web server, or struggling to find the right local filesystem URL for a test HTML file.
