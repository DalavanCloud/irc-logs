[2013-05-21 03:03:37] andreastt: Is your core.ignorecase set to true?
[2013-05-21 03:03:49] andreastt: git does some magic to deal with case insensitive file systems.
[2013-05-21 03:04:18] andreastt: Also, isn't the HFS+ case insensitive?

[2013-05-21 03:09:13] andreastt: I think it's case preserving, but not case insensitive.  I suspect git is trying to be clever about it.

[2013-05-21 03:13:12] AutomatedTester: it was
[2013-05-21 03:13:15] AutomatedTester: and I set it to false
[2013-05-21 03:13:20] AutomatedTester: and can work with the file
[2013-05-21 03:13:33] andreastt: I don't think it defaults to true on Mac.  It shouldn't anyway.
[2013-05-21 03:13:50] AutomatedTester: I know I never changed it

[2013-05-21 04:40:34] ronny: hi
[2013-05-21 04:40:47] ronny: i got a tricky problem here using webdriver api driven tests
[2013-05-21 04:41:23] ronny: clicking a button will scroll it under a hovering message and it turns unclickable, whats a good strategy for solving
[2013-05-21 04:45:12] Ardesco: how would up manually deal with this situation ?
[2013-05-21 04:46:39] ronny: wait it out or click a close button, the problem is, that the notifications area is dynamically created by some javascript after page creation
[2013-05-21 04:47:04] ronny: so its created after a bit, then can be clicked, and after another timeout its gone from the dom again
[2013-05-21 04:47:11] ronny: (i.e. hell to script out)
[2013-05-21 04:47:23] Ardesco: sounds like an explicit wait is required
[2013-05-21 04:47:44] Ardesco: AdditionalConditions.visibilityOfElementLocatedBy
[2013-05-21 04:47:53] Ardesco: if you are Java based
[2013-05-21 04:47:59] ronny: im python based
[2013-05-21 04:48:06] Ardesco: don't know the conditions fr other bindings off the top of my head
[2013-05-21 04:48:40] Ardesco: basically explicit wait until it becomes visible then click it quick
[2013-05-21 04:48:41] ronny: Ardesco, the nasty part of the problem is, the button is clickable, but when the click method is called it gets scrolled below the hovering message area
[2013-05-21 04:48:57] ronny: and then its no longer clickable
[2013-05-21 04:49:09] Ardesco: so can't you wait it out with an explicit wait
[2013-05-21 04:49:25] Ardesco: i thought that's what you said you would do manually

[2013-05-21 04:50:53] Ardesco: lets step back
[2013-05-21 04:50:57] Ardesco: when you said wait it out
[2013-05-21 04:51:00] Ardesco: what did you mean
[2013-05-21 04:51:29] Ardesco: does the hovering message dissapear?
[2013-05-21 04:52:29] ronny: Ardesco, yes, the problem is how to wait it out, since it doesnt exist at the beginning of the page, then is dynamically created
[2013-05-21 04:52:51] ronny: so i kinda have to wait for its creation first, then wait for it to disappear/make it disappear
[2013-05-21 04:53:21] ronny: brb, phone
[2013-05-21 04:53:27] Ardesco: but is it the button you are interested in rather than the hover message?

[2013-05-21 04:56:17] ronny: re
[2013-05-21 04:56:45] ronny: Ardesco, yes, i want the button, but when i give it a click command it is scrolled below the hover message
[2013-05-21 04:57:48] Ardesco: so at that point can you perform an explicit wait to wait for either the button to be clickable again
[2013-05-21 04:57:56] Ardesco: or the hover message to no longer be visible

[2013-05-21 06:16:18] llaskin: oh interesting
[2013-05-21 06:16:56] llaskin: btw, what are folks using to drive testing of non webkit IOS and Android apps?  Can selenium do it, assuming no, since they are non-webkit
[2013-05-21 06:17:26] jimevans: ios-driver does native apps, if i recall correctly.
[2013-05-21 06:17:38] jrock20041: llaskin: http://www.compuware.com/application-performance-management/
[2013-05-21 06:18:20] jrock20041: what has this guy upset is that webdriver interacts with an element when its not ready
[2013-05-21 06:18:49] jimevans: jrock20041: knowing that there's network traffic wouldn't help.
[2013-05-21 06:18:50] jrock20041: I believe that javascript is manupliating the item
[2013-05-21 06:19:20] jrock20041: well his thought would be is at every page you check that there is no network traffic for x seconds
[2013-05-21 06:19:24] jimevans: i guarantee i could create a page that would break "just waiting for the network traffic to stop"
[2013-05-21 06:20:17] jrock20041: My solution is have atPage methods that look for an element that takes some time to load
[2013-05-21 06:20:48] llaskin: jrock20041: thats not true, it doesn't unless you don't use explicit waits....
[2013-05-21 06:21:35] jrock20041: I think explicit waits would not help for this problem
[2013-05-21 06:21:46] llaskin: they wait for the element to be ready....
[2013-05-21 06:22:03] jimevans: jrock20041: i'd be willing to bet you can craft an appropriate explicit wait.
[2013-05-21 06:22:27] jrock20041: But just waiting for the element to be ready does not tell you that all javascript is done on the page that could manuplate the dom
[2013-05-21 06:22:44] jrock20041: does it?
[2013-05-21 06:23:16] llaskin: i mean, you can identify what the last loaded element on a page is, and wait for it to appear
[2013-05-21 06:23:38] jimevans: no, it doesn't. and that's an impossible condition to detect, which is why webdriver doesn't even try, and why the selenium rc "waitForPageToLoad" method is such a confusing piece of… software.
[2013-05-21 06:23:44] jrock20041: llaskin: that is true but that is not wasy to do either :)
[2013-05-21 06:23:52] llaskin: jrock20041: noone said it was easy:)

[2013-05-21 06:24:12] jimevans: jrock20041: you know what the element is that you want to interact with, right?
[2013-05-21 06:24:17] jimevans: (on any given page)
[2013-05-21 06:24:23] jrock20041: yeppers
[2013-05-21 06:24:29] jimevans: then wait for it.
[2013-05-21 06:24:35] jimevans: that element.
[2013-05-21 06:24:46] jrock20041: see the problem we are having is that we do have the wait
[2013-05-21 06:24:49] jimevans: wait for it to be present, and available, and in the state you need it to be in.
[2013-05-21 06:24:53] jrock20041: on that element
[2013-05-21 06:25:13] jimevans: why is that a problem? it's a single utility method, ffs.
[2013-05-21 06:25:26] llaskin: so what is the issue?
[2013-05-21 06:25:34] llaskin: are you arguing that the element changes after the waiter is satisfied?
[2013-05-21 06:25:35] jrock20041: so the code sees the element is ready, grabs the text and does a compare and it fals. In looking at the screenshot the text matches
[2013-05-21 06:25:41] Ardesco: jrock20041: jquery?

[2013-05-21 11:16:31] Dude-X: barancev: the setup was plain java firefoxdriver, not using selenium server as a remote; i have no clue why the driver would call get twice…. it should just block until the call completes in some way
[2013-05-21 11:16:58] stackedsax1: the php bindings should be able to send to grid, yes.  not that I've used them in an age.  but the parallelization would come from your test framework.  I assume phpunit for you?
[2013-05-21 11:17:10] ej: yes, phpunit
[2013-05-21 11:17:18] barancev: exactly. I'd suppose it was caused by your framework (wrapper around selenium) may be?
[2013-05-21 11:22:28] Dude-X: barancev: for a driver.get we have no wait until command; my wrapper only has a sleep after the initial get

[2013-05-21 12:20:48] Dude-X: i didn't set a timeout
[2013-05-21 12:21:02] Dude-X: it's suppose to block or wait until the get call completes

[2013-05-21 12:21:41] barancev: huh, really? no timeout? why, I wonder
[2013-05-21 12:21:57] Dude-X: but once we removed the timeout from apache, you can have an open connection for as long you want
[2013-05-21 12:22:15] barancev: that's suboptimal
[2013-05-21 12:22:20] Dude-X: a get may be downloading a file for example
