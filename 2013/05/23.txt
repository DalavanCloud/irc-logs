[2013-05-23 02:40:59] AutomatedTester: Phil37: why? there is a perfectly good API for alerts in webdriver
[2013-05-23 02:41:44] Phil37: we have some batch scripts and an UnexpectedPopup.exe that have been there since I got here
[2013-05-23 02:41:59] Phil37: there are similar files for uploading which we are now doing properly with sendKeys
[2013-05-23 02:42:20] Phil37: so idk they must have ran into issues trying to do it normally
[2013-05-23 02:46:43] barancev: AutomatedTester: just catch an exception. the alert is auto-dismissed (by default) after the exception thrown

[2013-05-23 03:54:34] barancev: simonstewart: why the spec says "If the remote end is unable to capture the entire DOM, then the part of the DOM currently displayed in UI of the browser must be captured" -- why not allow to catch as much as possible?
[2013-05-23 03:55:19] simonstewart: When taking a screenshot?
[2013-05-23 03:55:25] barancev: it's about screenshots, yes
[2013-05-23 03:57:34] simonstewart: Because "as much as possible" leaves too much room for interpretation
[2013-05-23 03:57:44] barancev: I'd suggest to change last "must" to "should"
[2013-05-23 03:58:04] simonstewart: Why?
[2013-05-23 03:58:27] rananda, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-23 03:58:40] barancev: "must" is too restrictive :)
[2013-05-23 03:58:58] simonstewart: That is part of the intention
[2013-05-23 03:59:23] simonstewart: As stated, everything will return some sort of image
[2013-05-23 03:59:29] AutomatedTester: we MUST avoid SHOULD as much as possible
[2013-05-23 03:59:39] AutomatedTester: SHOULD === ambiguous
[2013-05-23 03:59:41] simonstewart: At the most basic it'll be a dump of the HWND (or equivalent)
[2013-05-23 03:59:51] barancev: it means that is a page is too long and can't be captured complete -- a driver can't make a picture of a "long-enough" part of the page, it MUST make a picture of the visible part only
[2013-05-23 04:00:16] Scoding, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-23 04:00:19] barancev: it's rfc2119, right?
[2013-05-23 04:00:33] simonstewart: The RFC to with MUST, SHOULD? yes
[2013-05-23 04:01:01] barancev: "SHOULD This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course"
[2013-05-23 04:01:26] barancev: "MUST This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification."
[2013-05-23 04:01:51] simonstewart: Right.
[2013-05-23 04:02:28] simonstewart: If you can find a way of using MUST that captures what you're thinking without leaving wriggle room for assholes to implement things in a completely broken way, I'd like to hear it
[2013-05-23 04:02:29] barancev: so, for a long pare I'd like to obtain a picture that contains as much of the page as possible, reasonable, right?

[2013-05-23 04:06:23] muay-guy: Hi, I'm having some issues with selenium(2.33)/django after upgrading to django 1.5. Selenium execs a couple of tests and then stops working altogether. I'm using chrome webdriver
[2013-05-23 04:06:57] andreastt: AutomatedTester: I replied to that.
[2013-05-23 04:07:06] AutomatedTester: did you?

[2013-05-23 04:47:19] barancev: or to github :)
[2013-05-23 04:47:25] dawagner: github doesn't do downloads either
[2013-05-23 04:47:27] jimevans: well, we have until january.

[2013-05-23 04:51:05] jimevans: well, i guess we'll just have to find another solution for distribution.
[2013-05-23 04:52:13] dawagner: Maven.
[2013-05-23 04:52:20] Ardesco: Maven
[2013-05-23 04:52:23] Ardesco: gah beat me to it
[2013-05-23 04:52:36] Ardesco: you can complete the move to Maven totally
[2013-05-23 04:52:46] Ardesco: Selenium can now be a maven project \o/
[2013-05-23 04:52:49] Manoj_: dawagner: I guess we can have a page for selenium and then from there we can initiate downloads. Github pages ? I have seen GitHub pages allows a download - for Appium earlier
[2013-05-23 04:53:18] Manoj_: ahh.. there comes a Maven fan... :))
[2013-05-23 04:53:18] Ardesco: Manoj_: read the link barancev posted :)
[2013-05-23 04:53:27] dawagner: At worst we can just copy files to google cloud storage or s3 or something
[2013-05-23 04:53:49] Manoj_: Google Drive.. as they themselves suggessted.
[2013-05-23 04:54:05] Ardesco: bittorrent!
[2013-05-23 04:54:26] Manoj_: torrent...???
[2013-05-23 04:54:50] jimevans: maven? simonstewart will have kittens.
[2013-05-23 04:55:28] Ardesco: heheh do people really think I'm being serious about maven? : )
[2013-05-23 04:55:38] Manoj_: Sponsar of Selenium project - the Sauce Labs - Sauce Cloud ?
[2013-05-23 04:56:33] Ardesco: Oh an Manoj_   torrent is well used
[2013-05-23 04:56:35] Ardesco: e.g. http://www.debian.org/CD/torrent-cd/
[2013-05-23 04:57:44] Manoj_: the guess torrent will be  blocked on many corporate network Env.
[2013-05-23 04:58:11] Ardesco: why ?
[2013-05-23 04:58:27] jimevans: Ardesco: because, y'know, bittorrent.

[2013-05-23 04:59:05] Manoj_: if its a better corp - it will be blocked :)
[2013-05-23 04:59:37] Manoj_: ok, so cant we get some space from Sauce cloud for this ?
[2013-05-23 04:59:42] Ardesco: hmmm
[2013-05-23 05:00:07] Ardesco: I can't zero in of the cause of the IEDriverServer.exe crashed i'm getting
[2013-05-23 05:00:30] Ardesco: the log files are either empty or writing at the time of crash
[2013-05-23 05:00:33] Ardesco: doesn't seem consistent
[2013-05-23 05:00:38] jimevans: Ardesco: crashing? that sounds bad. i'd love to help.
[2013-05-23 05:01:03] Ardesco: My best guess at the moment is that I'm sending a command over after doing a driver.quit()
[2013-05-23 05:01:13] Ardesco: and that's causing a crash
[2013-05-23 05:01:17] Ardesco: but I can't substantiate it

[2013-05-23 06:28:05] jimevans: barancev: there's a case to be made that the synthetic events case should be scrolling, no?

[2013-05-23 06:30:13] jimevans: barancev: what i mean is, shouldn't the synthetic events case be as close to the native events case as possible? and if so, wouldn't that imply scrolling?

[2013-05-23 06:31:23] barancev: jimevans: as I understand, it should not be "as close as possible" regarding to scrolling, but it should fire the same events

[2013-05-23 07:23:08] AutomatedTester: because you assume all mobile phones have back buttons

[2013-05-23 07:35:05] AutomatedTester: if in the browser you pull the menu down and use it
[2013-05-23 07:35:24] AutomatedTester: but if you "install" facebook you dont have a browser as such

[2013-05-23 07:36:35] andreastt: simonstewart: So about buck, how should I avoid “Cycle found”'s if I have component A depending on B, and B on A?
[2013-05-23 07:36:52] simonstewart: Extract the common piece into C
[2013-05-23 07:36:58] simonstewart: Then have both A and B depend on C

[2013-05-23 07:52:09] jimevans: which i have a solution for
[2013-05-23 07:52:16] jimevans: but it's out of scope for webdrive.r
[2013-05-23 07:52:52] jimevans: simonstewart: doesn't really matter. could be authentication dialog, could be download prompts, could be print dialog, could be any number of things.
[2013-05-23 07:53:10] jimevans: those are (and ought to be) out of scope for webdriver.
[2013-05-23 07:53:12] simonstewart: At some point, I'll finish the authenticateUsing(Credentials) stuff
[2013-05-23 07:54:10] jimevans: the thing is, there's room for other projects to build generic dialog handling on top of webdriver, but it needs a hook.

[2013-05-23 07:56:57] jimevans: brockfredin: yep. happens all the time, in chrome. usually when the element one wants to click on is obscured by another element.
[2013-05-23 07:57:50] AutomatedTester: dawagner: dev tools?
[2013-05-23 07:58:54] eranm: jimevans, it is. But I'm not sure why it's needed...
[2013-05-23 07:59:45] brockfredin: jimevans Right.  The explanation is fairly straight forward.  There's nothing oscuring the element though.  I'll gist and upload the photo

[2013-05-23 08:00:34] simonstewart: Even by my standards, that last change broke a lot
[2013-05-23 08:00:58] andreastt: simonstewart: So can I set source="7" and target="7" for all the BUCK files somewhere?
[2013-05-23 08:01:00] jimevans: eranm: the use case is to provide a hook for a generic dialog handling project. if i have the pid, i can query the windows in the system to find those belonging to that pid, and thus use the window handle (which *isn't* standardized across OSes) as the basis for watching for said dialogs.
[2013-05-23 08:01:04] simonstewart: yeah
[2013-05-23 08:01:08] simonstewart: In the java_library
[2013-05-23 08:01:23] simonstewart: We really should make it visible in the .buckconfig too
[2013-05-23 08:01:30] simonstewart: But I don't think it's there yet
[2013-05-23 08:01:47] jimevans: brockfredin: if you can provide a reproducible test case, i'm sure the chromedriver developers would love to see it.
[2013-05-23 08:03:18] andreastt: simonstewart: So I have to set it for every java_library?
[2013-05-23 08:03:36] simonstewart: andreastt: until we do the sane thing and make it configurable via .buckconfig
[2013-05-23 08:03:42] andreastt: Okay.
[2013-05-23 08:03:53] andreastt: Having the default in the config, then allowing it to be overridden would make sense.
[2013-05-23 08:03:55] simonstewart: Because we use buck to build our android apps, and we still need to support gingerbread

[2013-05-23 08:07:29] simonstewart: We have something, but it's not on the scale of google
[2013-05-23 08:07:37] simonstewart: Almost nothing is, tbh :)
[2013-05-23 08:07:42] jimevans: brockfredin: nothing much we can do about it from our end. we're just reporting what comes back from chromedriver.exe. so again, i say, reproducible test case, so the chromedriver guys can debug and hopefully fix. also, you might try chromedriver2, just to see if that works.
[2013-05-23 08:08:05] AutomatedTester: andreastt: as participants I believe

[2013-05-23 08:17:42] jimevans: eranm: that pull request isn't expected to work in the multiple instance case. and that's why i've not merged it in.
[2013-05-23 08:18:10] jimevans: Ardesco: are you at least getting the crashes in consistent places?
[2013-05-23 08:18:40] Ardesco: to be honest i'm not sure atm
[2013-05-23 08:18:47] Ardesco: just waiting for the second test run to finish
[2013-05-23 08:18:54] Ardesco: not reproduced it with a single case yet
[2013-05-23 08:19:10] Ardesco: unfortunately it's about 2 hours a run for IE
[2013-05-23 08:19:16] Ardesco: damne IE JavaScript engine
[2013-05-23 08:19:17] jimevans: Ardesco: i was afraid i broke something. sounds like i did pretty severely. dammit.
[2013-05-23 08:20:02] jimevans: and it's broken for you in 2.32.0?
[2013-05-23 08:20:18] eranm: jimevans,and how would you envision the behaviour of the cache cleaning  feature in the multiple instances case?
[2013-05-23 08:20:33] jimevans: eranm: i don't think you can. that's my point.
[2013-05-23 08:21:29] eranm: jimevans, my understanding of that feature is that it cleans the cache once when the driver starts *if* that capability is specified.
[2013-05-23 08:21:45] Ardesco: yup broken in 2.32.0 as well for me
[2013-05-23 08:21:57] Ardesco: i forgot to update the IEDriverServer.exe when that came out
[2013-05-23 08:22:00] farlan, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-23 08:22:02] Ardesco: so didn't notice it
[2013-05-23 08:22:46] eranm: So it seems like it'd hurt the multiple instance case only if the user intentionally asks for this capability. Which means they read somewhere about it. And we can point out, where we document this capability, that it would not work well in the multiple instances case.
[2013-05-23 08:22:50] jimevans: eranm: yes, it's hidden behind a capability. yes, it may be useful in the single instance case. but if you have multiple instances running, that behavior is going to be undefined.
[2013-05-23 08:23:06] Ardesco: that being said IE8 runs fine
[2013-05-23 08:23:35] eranm: jimevans, do you not think that cleaning the cache is a core WebDriver feature?
[2013-05-23 08:23:42] jimevans: eranm: as i said before, i've been loathe to add stuff to the IE driver that deliberately breaks under the multiple instance case.
[2013-05-23 08:23:55] brockfredin: jimevans Where is the Chrome 2 driver?
[2013-05-23 08:24:04] jimevans: but i'm rapidly approaching my "i just don't give a shit anymore" threshold.

[2013-05-23 08:24:22] eranm: jimevans, how about we make this capability a no-op if there are multiple instances running?

[2013-05-23 11:36:35] manoj_: ok so yes, the best practice is in place. like page objects .etc...
[2013-05-23 11:36:53] manoj_: and most of the test cases are of medium complex….
[2013-05-23 11:37:18] manoj_: so any one..?
[2013-05-23 11:37:22] tobie, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-23 11:37:26] lukeis: i assumed using PageObjects… but sometimes it's a new page or the page has never had a PO implemented for it
[2013-05-23 11:37:58] lukeis: and even if one does exist, you often need more methods ;)
[2013-05-23 11:38:41] manoj_: right...
[2013-05-23 11:38:43] lukeis: very complex / cross browser running… can often take the whole day if not longer…
[2013-05-23 11:38:57] lukeis: for just 1
[2013-05-23 11:38:57] manoj_: how many ?
[2013-05-23 11:39:04] manoj_: okay...!!!
[2013-05-23 11:39:34] lukeis: i've done as many as 10 test cases in a day though ;)
[2013-05-23 11:39:52] manoj_: lukeis is a brilliant guy
[2013-05-23 11:39:56] lukeis: (more if you count data multipliers or browser configs)
[2013-05-23 11:40:29] lukeis: but trying to measure this is a bad sign ;)
[2013-05-23 11:40:30] manoj_: our company norms is 4 per day… but the client asks for 8 a day.. tough times....
[2013-05-23 11:41:20] manoj_: yes they see as a measure but not on the ROI that they might get if its done with good quality one.
[2013-05-23 11:41:27] lukeis: well, 1 test in my mind could be 8 in theirs… see, my "test scenario handles IE / FF/ Chrome / Safari / iOS / Android "
[2013-05-23 11:42:55] barancev: the norm is 25
[2013-05-23 11:43:32] manoj_: no they know the app complexity.. and it has many data dependencies from DB and all stuffs….
[2013-05-23 11:43:47] manoj_: with FF, chrome, Safari in mac and win
[2013-05-23 11:44:15] manoj_: 25 TC's / day ?
[2013-05-23 11:44:20] barancev: yes :)
[2013-05-23 11:44:30] manoj_: Absolutely.. No
[2013-05-23 11:44:45] manoj_: i haven't seen so far anywhere that states 25.
[2013-05-23 11:44:49] barancev: if you can only 4 -- just split them to 6 parts and you get 25
[2013-05-23 11:44:52] manoj_: the mac norm that i have seen is 10
[2013-05-23 11:45:14] manoj_: lol barancev: we can't do that.. the Tc's are like that
[2013-05-23 11:45:25] manoj_: the a strict One -O- One mapping is needed.
[2013-05-23 11:45:34] manoj_: so in that case… 4 is 4 and 8 is 8
[2013-05-23 11:46:09] lukeis: if someone is just requiring X number of cases to do per day… then i would find another job
[2013-05-23 11:46:10] barancev: mapping of what to what?
[2013-05-23 11:46:59] manoj_: lukeis: Agreed.
[2013-05-23 11:48:01] manoj_: 1 Functional Tc = 1 Automated Script.
[2013-05-23 11:48:31] manoj_: the client is shit...
[2013-05-23 11:48:39] barancev: so please ask your test designers to make shorter "functional TCes" :)
[2013-05-23 11:49:16] lukeis: in that case I would do 8 in a day easy…..  "Enter X into field, etc…" then change X out with 'valid' 'invalid1' 'invalid2' ....
[2013-05-23 11:49:16] manoj_: lol
[2013-05-23 11:49:23] Turzai, quitting. (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[2013-05-23 11:50:00] barancev: another protip: use a different calculation schema: you implement a single scenario, and a data provider that generates 100 data sets == 100 test cases done
[2013-05-23 11:50:15] manoj_: barancev: moving forward  that should be the strategy… But for now the Tc's are already written few months ago.. and now only automation… so the probs...
[2013-05-23 11:50:48] lukeis: then you should look for where the test cases overlap and work on those in one day
[2013-05-23 11:50:55] manoj_: lukeis: The one that you mentioned is a Simple… but the TC's that i am talking about is Medium complex and v.complex.
[2013-05-23 11:51:25] barancev: why do yo uautomate them at all?
[2013-05-23 11:52:17] simonstewart, quitting. (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[2013-05-23 11:52:22] manoj_: lukeis: when they consider measure then obvious that they will not give time for that all...
[2013-05-23 11:52:27] manoj_: barancev: which ?
[2013-05-23 11:53:05] phishy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-23 11:53:09] barancev: what's the purpose of this automation activity?
[2013-05-23 11:53:11] lukeis: well, simply don't agree to the number
[2013-05-23 11:53:42] AutomatedTester: lukeis: the hotel Simon and I are staying in is a nice walk away from the conf center
[2013-05-23 11:53:51] manoj_: lukeis: Right, its good that there is someone who think's what I have in my mind.
[2013-05-23 11:54:04] barancev: why do you need to automate exactly these scenarious one-to-one?
[2013-05-23 11:54:24] manoj_: that's a strict requirement
[2013-05-23 11:54:25] barancev: why can't you optimize your work?
[2013-05-23 11:54:46] barancev: long scenarious == hard to debug, hard to analyse failures
[2013-05-23 11:54:50] lukeis: AutomatedTester: I know, i'm a block away from you (on milk st.)
[2013-05-23 11:54:51] AutomatedTester: jleyba_: hey, there are webdriverjs pull requests on github
[2013-05-23 11:55:01] manoj_: we did it, in a flow based.. with customised results as well… but they wanna one-o-one.
[2013-05-23 11:55:18] barancev: thete is no such thing as "strict requirement"
[2013-05-23 11:55:24] barancev: anything is negotiatable
[2013-05-23 11:55:33] manoj_: our Management  is failing there.
[2013-05-23 11:56:30] barancev: from my experience, when you implement a DSL for a new app -- you are slow to ship scenarious, but as soon as DSL is ready you can do 10-20 test scenarios per day
[2013-05-23 11:56:32] manoj_: barancev: there you are with a point "Negotiate" - You know what they fail to negotiate with the terms and fears they might lose the contact… :(
[2013-05-23 11:56:33] cgoldberg: i've seen anywhere from  1 testcase per week, to several dozen per developer per day... depends on where you are in your cycle and what your tooling is
[2013-05-23 11:57:40] cgoldberg: barancev, i agree with a dsl/framework for a new app.  invest a little upfront and reap benefits longer term with quick small tests
[2013-05-23 11:57:45] barancev: and it depends on AJAXiness of the app, on the speed of the server where you debug, on complexity of the locators, etc
[2013-05-23 11:58:07] manoj_: the framework that is designed is good with PO and DSL 's….
[2013-05-23 11:58:52] manoj_: and good flexibility that a script written in that framework will run both on RC as well as Webdriver…. with just changing the flag value
[2013-05-23 11:59:05] dawagner, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-05-23 11:59:18] cgoldberg: manoj_, so you have selenium tests (i only implement a selenium/browser-based test for acceptance tests)  ... do you also have unit tests?
[2013-05-23 11:59:30] barancev: if you want numbers -- don't try to work faster, play this game -- look for cheats :)
[2013-05-23 11:59:37] cgoldberg: and whats the balance/ratio of acceptance vs. unit?
[2013-05-23 11:59:38] manoj_: no unit tests
[2013-05-23 11:59:54] cgoldberg: manoj_, i'd worry more about that then
[2013-05-23 11:59:59] cgoldberg: manoj_, thats crazy talk :)
[2013-05-23 12:00:03] manoj_: yes, it is.
[2013-05-23 12:00:35] cgoldberg: manoj_, without unit tests, you might consider not writing browser based tests at all.. until that's fixed
[2013-05-23 12:00:44] manoj_: its a critical app as well, with lot of complexity… its a good learning.
[2013-05-23 12:01:10] manoj_: but due to this measure it makes us sick…..
[2013-05-23 12:01:57] manoj_: You know what - you would be surprised to hear the Client Name.
[2013-05-23 12:02:15] manoj_: But I would not mention here.
[2013-05-23 12:02:41] barancev: a company name means nothing, you work with concrete people that can be smart or not
[2013-05-23 12:04:24] manoj_: company name matter's when we know that they are matured enough in all process and still see only the measure but not the ROI(if done with good quality)
[2013-05-23 12:04:34] barancev: actually, I suppose I know the situation, I've been many times in India (you're from Bangalore, right?) -- and I've seen your managers don't negitiate even if they allowed to
[2013-05-23 12:04:44] barancev: I don't know why
[2013-05-23 12:04:58] barancev: may be it's a cultural issue
[2013-05-23 12:04:59] manoj_: Other way's you are right, we work on what we love "selenium"
[2013-05-23 12:05:09] manoj_: lol, its not cultural issue.
[2013-05-23 12:05:44] manoj_: Its a IT trend. Since all are Service based companies.. they fear of losing the projects to other competitors.
[2013-05-23 12:05:49] qaguy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-05-23 12:06:11] barancev: yes, may be it's high competitive market
[2013-05-23 12:06:26] manoj_: yes a lot of competitors.
[2013-05-23 12:06:41] manoj_: good that you were here. - I am from Chennai
[2013-05-23 12:07:29] barancev: oh, sorry, I've beed to Chennai too :)
[2013-05-23 12:07:35] barancev: *beeen
[2013-05-23 12:07:37] barancev: *been
[2013-05-23 12:07:47] manoj_: nothing to be sorry…

[2013-05-23 12:09:38] barancev: no, we were selling a tool, and I've been a technican and a teacher
[2013-05-23 12:10:18] manoj_: Cool
[2013-05-23 12:10:44] barancev: your managers under-negotiate, even if they can they don't attempt
[2013-05-23 12:11:02] manoj_: let me know when you are here some time in future - we shall meet up.
[2013-05-23 12:11:26] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-23 12:11:30] manoj_: right, majority fear to negotiate.
[2013-05-23 12:11:43] barancev: being asked "can you automate these test scenarios" they don't try to tell you "we suggest to rework them for better automation", instead they answer "yes, we can"
[2013-05-23 12:12:08] barancev: may be it
[2013-05-23 12:12:27] barancev: it's a fear to loose a client, may be
[2013-05-23 12:12:49] barancev: but your engineers have to do this work after that :)
[2013-05-23 12:15:13] rp2: I'm still in my uphill struggle with TestNG ... I think I should take a course or something
[2013-05-23 12:15:56] barancev: what's about testNG?
[2013-05-23 12:16:01] rp2: well
[2013-05-23 12:16:42] rp2: I like the TestNG Eclipse plugin, the way it reports the tests in a tree view and the way you can rerun them from the treeview
[2013-05-23 12:16:46] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-23 12:16:55] rp2: but I can't bend it to my will
[2013-05-23 12:17:51] rp2: the problem is test parametrization ... this really isn't Selenium specific except that the parmeters happen to be Selenium-specific because I'm runnign Selenium tests
[2013-05-23 12:18:20] barancev: so, what's about parametrization?
[2013-05-23 12:18:22] coreygriggs, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-23 12:18:36] barancev: do you want to rerun a test with a specific set of parameters?
[2013-05-23 12:19:13] manoj_: barancev: lol
[2013-05-23 12:19:25] barancev: I bet it is not possible without modification of a DataProvider
[2013-05-23 12:19:50] rp2: right now I have 2 parameters: browser and site
[2013-05-23 12:19:59] Ardesco_Home, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-23 12:20:12] barancev: ok
[2013-05-23 12:20:33] rp2: all tests should run for each browser and each site
[2013-05-23 12:20:48] manoj_: yes, I need to motivate the team rather than complaining Should advice to move from here :P
[2013-05-23 12:20:56] manoj_: (on a funny note)
[2013-05-23 12:21:36] ryanpetr_, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-23 12:21:44] rp2: tests depend on each other
[2013-05-23 12:22:28] rp2: tests colour grean in the treevie when they succeeded, red when they ffailed, and yellow when they were not executed due to a dependent test failing
[2013-05-23 12:22:32] rp2: so far, so good

[2013-05-23 12:23:38] rp2: however, this should really happen per papameter value
[2013-05-23 12:23:38] AutomatedTester: are there any users of my BrowserMob Proxy library in here?
[2013-05-23 12:23:52] rp2: or rather, pair of values
[2013-05-23 12:24:17] barancev: rp2: why do you want to run all this from Eclipse?
[2013-05-23 12:24:17] rp2: this is where I'm stuck
[2013-05-23 12:24:20] rp2: yes.
[2013-05-23 12:24:29] barancev: why?
[2013-05-23 12:24:39] rp2: I'm trying to use the provided facilities as much as possible

[2013-05-23 12:25:06] rp2: well, i have a @Dataprovider on each test that provides all combinations of parameter values
[2013-05-23 12:25:24] barancev: a better solution is: 1) start a CI-server (e.g. Jenkins), 2) configure a job for each site-browser pair, 3) run your tests on CI
[2013-05-23 12:25:28] rp2: the effect is that in turn, each test is run with all combinations of values.
[2013-05-23 12:25:46] plightbo_work, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-05-23 12:26:00] barancev: exactly, that's how DataProviders work in testNG
[2013-05-23 12:26:18] plightbo_work, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-23 12:26:42] barancev: don't use dataProviders to generate site-browser pairs, make them a parameter of test suite
[2013-05-23 12:26:47] rp2: and that is wrong. if test 4 fails for IE and test 5 depends on it, test 5 should be yellow for IE, but red or green for Firefox
[2013-05-23 12:26:59] barancev: and run suite as many times as many pairs you need
[2013-05-23 12:27:34] rp2: I had them as test suite parameters, but multiple parameter values aren't really supported by TestNG
[2013-05-23 12:28:23] rp2: the problem is that if I do that, I only get one tree node per test, and I don't even know for which parameter value combination it shows
[2013-05-23 12:28:33] barancev: follow CI way
[2013-05-23 12:28:47] rp2: and the same thing happens in the HTML report: only one entry per test
[2013-05-23 12:29:17] rp2: it just so happens that I installed Jenkins 2 hours ago and looked at the site to figure out how it works
[2013-05-23 12:29:26] rp2: but how does it report its results?
[2013-05-23 12:29:36] barancev: :ci
[2013-05-23 12:29:36] selbot2__: Jenkins: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/ | Dashboard: http://dashboard.ci.seleniumhq.org/
[2013-05-23 12:30:00] barancev: you welcome to look to Selenium test results

[2013-05-23 12:30:47] rp2: wonderful!
[2013-05-23 12:31:06] rp2: i just *knew* #selenium was the answer :)
[2013-05-23 12:31:19] rp2: mmm
[2013-05-23 12:31:50] rp2: so can I combine the results of different jobs into a single report? (I guess so)

[2013-05-23 12:32:37] barancev: the dashboard http://dashboard.ci.seleniumhq.org/ is a home-brew tool
[2013-05-23 12:32:39] Ardesco_Home: reading back I would go for cultural issue
[2013-05-23 12:32:57] Ardesco_Home: most indian managers I have worked with say yes because you don't tell somebody you can't do something
[2013-05-23 12:33:08] barancev: source code of the dashboard is here: https://github.com/jarib/selenium-ci-dashboard
[2013-05-23 12:33:09] Ardesco_Home: used to really piss us off at first when dealing with offshore
[2013-05-23 12:33:18] Ardesco_Home: lots of nodding and yes and no delivery

[2013-05-23 12:34:23] rp2: OK
[2013-05-23 12:34:28] lukeis: Ardesco_Home: yeah… really sucks when your own manager does it (is now on a team responsible for a lot of different things)
[2013-05-23 12:34:51] rp2: what kept me from going this way is that it adds yet one more complex piece of Java software to the stack
[2013-05-23 12:34:53] Ardesco_Home: we have a similar problem where I am now, only not as bad
[2013-05-23 12:35:05] Ardesco_Home: scrum master likes to tell people what they want to hear even when it's not true
[2013-05-23 12:35:22] Ardesco_Home: we are doing continuous delivery, every build is a certified release
[2013-05-23 12:35:38] barancev: adding parts != increasing complexity
[2013-05-23 12:35:42] Ardesco_Home: but he et the business think they could roll back if there was a problem for about 3 months
[2013-05-23 12:35:44] rp2: certified in what sense?
[2013-05-23 12:35:46] Ardesco_Home: *let
[2013-05-23 12:35:52] Ardesco_Home: we don't roll back, we roll forwards

[2013-05-23 12:36:31] rp2: then again, people elsewhere on this floor are using Jenkins, and I already contemplated using it for a different project
[2013-05-23 12:36:40] Ardesco_Home: we know it works because we have excellent test coverage and rock solid selenium tests
[2013-05-23 12:37:11] Ardesco_Home: the challenge is keeping it that way as it grows larger :)

[2013-05-23 12:40:05] jimevans: so there were three revisions checked into prebuilts between 2.31.0.0 and 2.32.0.0. (and actually, 2.31.0.3 is virtually identical to 2.32.0.0) you could try each of those in turn to see where i actually broke things.
[2013-05-23 12:40:08] manoj_: need some rest.
[2013-05-23 12:40:12] jimevans: i know that's a lot to ask.
[2013-05-23 12:40:14] manoj_: have a good day ahead.
[2013-05-23 12:40:46] rp2: I was thinking perhaps JUnit can do what I need
