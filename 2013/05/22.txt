[2013-05-22 09:13:31] jimevans: for those keeping score at home, the firefox driver does so to clean up the anonymous profile that is copied into the temp directory, and that the firefox driver uses during its operation.
[2013-05-22 09:13:54] jimevans: that's completely unrelated to the conversation SimonWaters1969 is having, since he's using IDE/RC.

[2013-05-22 09:37:17] jimevans: SimonWaters1969: i hope that answers your question. i'd like to think i'm not just sitting here in the channel, slagging Selenium, and trolling people using it. particularly since i've dedicated a significant portion of the last 3.5 years of my life to making it better. :)
[2013-05-22 09:38:35] SimonWaters1969: jimevans, fair enough. Although not sure I have a serious automation effort here, I do remember a test suite (not web related) that was more work than the code base to maintain. Going to be involved in a lot more intensive testing of web apps soon, so if you've written your wisdom down somewhere I'll read it, and apply it in a couple of month - could save me 3.5 years ;)

[2013-05-22 09:49:06] brockfredin: When is Selenium going to create prompt handling?  I want it to automate Windows domain functions.
[2013-05-22 09:51:03] jimevans: brockfredin: it's not, at least not outside of the browser javascript alerts. there's a proposal floating around for handling authentication dialogs, but that's only at the discussion stages.
[2013-05-22 09:51:42] Bebe_, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-05-22 09:51:55] brockfredin: It should go far beyond just authentication dialogs.  It should recurse through process ID's to find specific windows.  It could be forked and development proposed to create these required tools.

[2013-05-22 10:09:05] jimevans: the challenge is that you need cross-platform handling too.
[2013-05-22 10:09:17] jimevans: just windows isn't good enough.
[2013-05-22 10:09:25] jimevans: you need linux and os x.

[2013-05-22 10:10:15] jimevans: i mean, you can take a look at https://github.com/jimevans/BrowserDialogHandler if you're specifically interested in handling dialogs.
[2013-05-22 10:11:00] jimevans: but webdriver doesn't expose anything to let you hook into that. (you need at a minimum a process id or an os-level window identifier)
[2013-05-22 10:11:52] brockfredin: jimevans I'll pair down and look into it.
[2013-05-22 10:12:43] jimevans: but i'm not sure i understand your use case.

[2013-05-22 10:14:39] brockfredin: Bridging narrow gaps between handling Windows, folder windows, and processes.   Downloading files for example.  Finding the file within a Windows OS.  Verifying it exists.  Handling the dialog and clicking 'submit'.  THan letting webdriver continue it's experience.

[2013-05-22 10:17:19] jimevans: from within the context of the browser, there's very little use for handling file dialogs. the main case is file downloads. webdriver already supports file uploads (for standard HTML upload elements). it's likely that there are other, more effective methods than manipulating UI windows for file finding and verification.

[2013-05-22 10:20:32] brockfredin: jimevans Morever, a wholeistic bridging of Selenium to Windows automation could bring Selenium into the hands of system admins.  Obviously I'm like the 98025 person who has thought this.  It's probably just a fantasy.  No one will ever really work to make it a reality.
[2013-05-22 10:21:38] jimevans: brockfredin: but for sysadmins, there are better tools already available. anytime you're trying to automate a UI to do sysadmin tasks, that's a code smell. :)

[2013-05-22 10:24:01] jimevans: but if it's your dream to have such a tool, you can make it happen. no one is stopping you from creating an open-source project that does exactly what you're asking for.
[2013-05-22 10:24:35] jimevans: and i find command lines to be much, much easier and more reliable than trying to synchronize an inherently asynchronous process (any windows-based UI)
[2013-05-22 10:24:37] brockfredin: jimevans I know.  Just punt it to me.  I'll just bang out some stellar system.  Give me like 3 days.
[2013-05-22 10:25:18] brockfredin: jimevans I want simple.  But I have a fatal error:  I want other people to do my work...

[2013-05-22 11:52:32] lukeis: hey awilson820: where do you like to get custom t-shirts made? (decent quality, i'm assuming you've had to do this for some conferences or even work...)
[2013-05-22 11:52:55] jimevans: manoj_: there used to be two flavors of "backed" things.
[2013-05-22 11:53:28] jimevans: one was webdriverbackedselenium, which is the selenium RC api backed by a webdriver backend.
[2013-05-22 11:53:36] jimevans: it's still around, and hasn't changed much.
[2013-05-22 11:53:42] lukeis: it was only really used for Safari RC to be run with WebDriver
[2013-05-22 11:53:47] manoj_: yeah, that is known . the other ?
[2013-05-22 11:53:51] jimevans: before the new safaridriver was completed, you used to have to use selenium RC
[2013-05-22 11:54:14] jimevans: so there was a SeleniumBackedWebDriver that laid the webdriver API over a selenium RC backend.
[2013-05-22 11:54:22] jimevans: it was intended to be used primarily for safari.
[2013-05-22 11:54:40] *lukeis missed the deletion of that'

[2013-05-22 13:45:26] AutomatedTester: early 2009
[2013-05-22 13:46:20] AutomatedTester: I got my commit bit Feb 2010 iirc
[2013-05-22 13:46:21] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i ended up looking through the dev list archives. looks like conversations were starting as early as january 2008.
[2013-05-22 13:46:49] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I know conversations were before hand
[2013-05-22 13:46:57] AutomatedTester: but I *think* code landing was 2009
[2013-05-22 13:47:05] jimevans: i think you're right too.
[2013-05-22 13:47:11] AutomatedTester: but am open to correction
[2013-05-22 13:48:02] jimevans: i remember i started submitting patches for the .net bindings in december 2009.
[2013-05-22 13:48:43] jimevans: and 2.0.0 released in june 2010.
[2013-05-22 13:48:46] AutomatedTester: I started January 2010
[2013-05-22 13:49:17] *AutomatedTester remembers the good ole days when it was him and Jim removing Simon's ".NET"'
[2013-05-22 13:49:19] AutomatedTester: code
[2013-05-22 13:49:25] jimevans: bah, i mean 2011.
[2013-05-22 13:49:41] lukeis: was about to say… i was around for 2.0.0 ;)
[2013-05-22 13:50:17] *jimevans is working on a blog post for the sfdc engineering blog'
[2013-05-22 13:50:22] AutomatedTester: I joined Mozilla in October 2010
[2013-05-22 13:50:43] AutomatedTester: and had been committing code before that
[2013-05-22 13:50:55] jimevans: i remember when you joined mozilla.
[2013-05-22 13:51:38] AutomatedTester: ahh the good ole days
[2013-05-22 13:52:00] lukeis: mid 2010, i was working at macy's when a thoughtworker showed me Selenium RC… i thought it was shitty ;)  really wished he showed me webdriver
[2013-05-22 13:52:31] AutomatedTester: TW wouldnt really have shown webdriver to customers
[2013-05-22 13:52:38] Dude-X: the idea of even automating web browser was mind-blowing to me when i first web driver in 2010
[2013-05-22 13:52:40] AutomatedTester: you had to be a real early adopter to use it then
[2013-05-22 13:52:54] lukeis: yup
[2013-05-22 13:53:26] lukeis: heh, I still have a place deep down for PAMIE ;)  /me automating IE back in ~ '04
[2013-05-22 13:53:35] llaskin: i started in late 2010 using RC i think
[2013-05-22 13:54:15] jimevans: heh. back when i had my borg implants, we didn't bother with a wrapper library. just used the raw COM objects. naturally, we only cared about IE.
[2013-05-22 13:54:16] jimevans: :)
[2013-05-22 13:54:40] lukeis: PAMIE was just a python wrapper of COM ;)

[2013-05-22 13:57:28] lukeis: engineering… reworking what engineers already worked out DECADES ago :)
[2013-05-22 13:57:31] jimevans: and how did you approach it?

[2013-05-22 13:58:34] lukeis: essentially "window.onerror = function(e){  write the error to a div }" then check for it existing on a page
[2013-05-22 13:58:49] jimevans: right. that's what i figured.

[2013-05-22 14:00:40] AutomatedTester: any errors on the page are then POST back to their server
[2013-05-22 14:00:58] lukeis: that's what we *should* be doing
[2013-05-22 14:01:09] lukeis: catch those JS errors that exist in the wild

[2013-05-22 14:08:12] lukeis: every time i see a video of someone using glass, it bothers me that they are looking up… not a very good HUD if you ask me ;)
[2013-05-22 14:08:15] AutomatedTester: so you suggest that people could use the screen for brainwashing and hacking a person

[2013-05-22 14:21:10] lukeis: woot 2.33 is already in maven central… that was relatively quick
[2013-05-22 14:22:11] lukeis: and here i was about to complain about the recent 'improvements' to sonatype since the workflow changed slightly
[2013-05-22 14:23:27] jimevans: how many users you think the project has worldwide?
[2013-05-22 14:23:43] jimevans: order of magnitude guess.
[2013-05-22 14:23:57] adamgoucher, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-22 14:25:22] jimevans: tens of thousands? hundreds of thousands? millions?
[2013-05-22 14:26:23] lukeis: tens i think… maybe slightly over 100k
[2013-05-22 14:26:35] *lukeis basing this on download stats'
[2013-05-22 14:26:40] jimevans: that'd be my guess.
[2013-05-22 14:27:11] lukeis: actually, very likely over 100k
[2013-05-22 14:27:54] lukeis: there's people that download the standalone server… then there's that use maven or *sigh* nuget or python or ruby
[2013-05-22 14:28:33] lukeis: plus there's all those 'internal' users that never download it directly from there
[2013-05-22 14:28:49] *jimevans loves that he's got other people sighing before naming that .NET packaging system.'

[2013-05-22 14:40:01] lukeis: just for reference of 2.32, pypi had 38,521 downloads.  maven has 9,970 (although 2.31 has 15,734).  ruby 182,724.  nuget 7,030.  standalone server: 46,475. java-zip 31,693
[2013-05-22 14:40:58] jimevans: i think "tens of thousands" is a safe phrase to use.
[2013-05-22 14:41:05] lukeis: I think ruby's numbers are inflated by autobuilds always downloading it (like tearing down vm's a starting fresh… ahem, travis)
[2013-05-22 14:41:31] lukeis: adding it altogether i'd say we're in the low 100k
[2013-05-22 14:42:09] plightbo, quitting. (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[2013-05-22 14:42:20] lukeis: maven users typically have intermediate nexus repo's, so we would potentially see only 1 download from a big organization
[2013-05-22 14:46:25] AutomatedTester: python would have inflated numbers like ruby
[2013-05-22 14:47:57] *lukeis <3 that ruby downloads blow away everything else… even though I no longer have any desire to touch a line of ruby code'
[2013-05-22 14:48:59] andreastt: lukeis: I share the sentiment.
[2013-05-22 14:49:32] andreastt: The numbers are skewed since the various languages uses different packaging systems.

[2013-05-22 14:50:19] andreastt: Downloading and installing Selenium via some (external) package repository for every usage I would call crazy.
[2013-05-22 14:50:57] andreastt: We've had _so_ many issues with network connectivity and remote package manager unreliability that I couldn't see anyone taking their tests seriously doing that.

[2013-05-22 16:54:43] Dude-X: if you're using py.test, you can create a fixture that will take a list of browsers
[2013-05-22 16:54:51] Dude-X: but that will run each browser serially...

[2013-05-22 16:57:55] munro: lol, one browser would be nice locally, so it doesn't keep popping up over my windows, but multiple browsers integrates better with saucelabs for me
