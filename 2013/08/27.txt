[2013-08-27 10:11:33] lukeis: if you use phantomjs, yes… otherwise a 'real' browser needs some kind of display (can be virtualized, aka xvfb)

[2013-08-27 11:44:26] phdjsep: Has anyone ever run into an issue where if a single test is run, it passes, but when a suite of tests are run, the same test fails?
[2013-08-27 11:44:38] phdjsep: It has nothing to do with test data either
[2013-08-27 11:46:21] lukeis: yes… you should see what the preceding test is doing / leaving the state
[2013-08-27 11:47:02] phdjsep: How could I check the state of the preceding test?
[2013-08-27 11:47:26] lukeis: watch it? :)  take a screenshot at the start of your test?
[2013-08-27 11:47:50] *lukeis assumes it's UI related… could be any number of things...'
[2013-08-27 11:47:53] phdjsep: It's running fine though. Starting browser, running test, then closing browser
[2013-08-27 11:48:41] lukeis: do you start a fresh browser for every test? if so, then it's likely something else then
[2013-08-27 11:50:38] phdjsep: I do. We have a couple inputs that require text on save. Selenium sends text to these fields and when it clicks save, an alert is sent indicating that text is needed. Interestingly. I run the test on its own and it works. Only appears when running the suite of tests
[2013-08-27 11:51:12] phdjsep: I'm really scratching my head here
[2013-08-27 11:53:19] swente: is it correct that findElement[s]ByXPath has problems with namespaces, or do i miss something? i can't get xpath-queries working for elements with a custom/explicit namespace.
[2013-08-27 11:55:20] phdjsep: swente: you have an example of a custom namespace?
[2013-08-27 11:56:02] phasze: phdjsep: are you just closing the browser in-between tests or are you calling driver Quit?
[2013-08-27 11:56:32] phdjsep: self.browser.quit()
[2013-08-27 11:56:52] phdjsep: browser = driver
[2013-08-27 11:57:00] swente: phdjsep: i just realize that it is a (malformed!) xhtml-declaration, as in <html  xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/broken"> ... <h:section>..   <- can't query for those sections.

[2013-08-27 12:00:35] phdjsep: Well, recently Chrome is acting haywire, so I haven't been able to test it
[2013-08-27 12:00:58] phdjsep: I'm not sure what's going on with that. The Chrome update seemed to jack things up

[2013-08-27 12:03:47] phdjsep: What do you mean?
[2013-08-27 12:04:03] phasze: perhaps you're re-using some variable across them
[2013-08-27 12:04:27] phdjsep: nope. Each test is self contained
[2013-08-27 12:05:39] phasze: what exactly does it fail on?
[2013-08-27 12:06:15] Scoding, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-27 12:06:24] phdjsep: There's a js alert that is thrown when the user tries to save and there is no text in the name field.
[2013-08-27 12:06:41] phdjsep: Problem is that selenium does fill those fields out
[2013-08-27 12:06:49] mansi, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2013-08-27 12:07:01] phasze: so in the suite selenium isn't filling those fields?
[2013-08-27 12:07:01] phdjsep: Sometimes it works (when run alone), other times it doesn't

[2013-08-27 12:07:12] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-27 12:07:20] phasze: so you do have failures when run alone sometimes?
[2013-08-27 12:07:40] phdjsep: Selenium is filling them out and then going to save, but getting the alert
[2013-08-27 12:08:20] phasze: do you sometimes see failures when running alone and not in the suite?
[2013-08-27 12:08:37] phdjsep: rarely, but it has happened
[2013-08-27 12:08:56] phdjsep: more difficult to reproduce that situation
[2013-08-27 12:09:27] phasze: what is sounds like is that selenium fills the fields and then clicks OK or whatever button you may have too quickly for your page
[2013-08-27 12:09:57] phdjsep: I thought that too, but the sleep I added didn't seem to help

[2013-08-27 12:13:13] phasze: well if you can see the fields filled in then it sounds like a webpage problem :P
[2013-08-27 12:13:25] phdjsep: ha, right
[2013-08-27 12:13:55] phdjsep: thanks for the help!
[2013-08-27 12:14:01] phasze: figure it out? :P
[2013-08-27 12:14:29] phdjsep: Not yet. Gonna go get lunch and come back and think with a full stomach ;)
