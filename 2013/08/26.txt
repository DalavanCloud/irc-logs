[2013-08-26 07:47:27] gdennis: barancev: none of the visibility checks looked up through the frame tree except for isScrolledIntoView
[2013-08-26 07:47:45] ruel, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-26 07:48:02] gdennis: and looking across frames in JS can run into cross-domain issues
[2013-08-26 07:48:35] jimevans: if i remember correctly, the assumptions are that if an element is inside a div with overflow hidden, and that element is outside the size of the div, we assume that element isn't visible, and can't be made visible. is that accurate?
[2013-08-26 07:48:55] gdennis: that is right
[2013-08-26 07:49:31] jimevans: ugh.
[2013-08-26 07:49:39] gdennis: well, can't be made visible by using a browser-provided scrollbar
[2013-08-26 07:50:09] jimevans: yeah, that's exactly the case i'm running into. in the mobile case, you can scroll using gestures.
[2013-08-26 07:50:10] barancev|2: gdennis: I got the point, I just don't know how to fix it without reimplementing scrolling code in firefox-driver
[2013-08-26 07:50:36] gdennis: we've actually run into a similar mobile issue internally with one test
[2013-08-26 07:50:45] brokenthumbs, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-08-26 07:50:53] jimevans: gdennis: have you resolved it? if so, how?
[2013-08-26 07:51:03] barancev|2: jimevans: in desktop you can switch to a link with TAB button, and a hidden link can magically came to visible area
[2013-08-26 07:51:48] jimevans: barancev|2: assuming your framework isn't doing things with tab order to prevent this.
[2013-08-26 07:52:00] barancev|2: right
[2013-08-26 07:52:23] gdennis: jimevans: it was raised right before I went on vacation, so didn't have time to look into it deeply yet, but the authored temporarily changed his test to call scrollIntoView directly on the element first
[2013-08-26 07:53:32] gdennis: jimevans: in your case, do the gestures trigger native browser scrolling, or is the UI listening for the touch events and doing the "scrolling" itself?

[2013-08-26 07:54:20] jimevans: gdennis: i'm not entirely sure. i'll need to look into how this particular framework does its mobile rendering.
[2013-08-26 07:54:59] rebelagentm, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-26 07:54:59] jimevans: this is a particularly pathological case
[2013-08-26 07:55:02] gdennis: if native browser scrolling is being triggered, then it's definitely a bug in the atoms
[2013-08-26 07:55:47] jimevans: the dev team in question is attempting to load the mobile site into chrome (changing the window size and user agent string), and emulate the mobile experience via desktop.
[2013-08-26 07:55:59] jimevans: it's entirely f'ed
[2013-08-26 07:56:46] jimevans: but the scrollIntoView suggestion is a very, very good one. i'd not considered that approach.
[2013-08-26 07:58:31] gdennis: yeah, element.scrollIntoView can sometimes scroll elements into view that are in overflow:hidden, where bot.action.scrollIntoView would now refuse to
[2013-08-26 08:00:21] barancev|2: gdennis: can you look at the test testShouldScrollOverflowElementsIfClickPointIsOutOfViewButElementIsInView -- it is not related to frames, but it is broken too by the recent atom update

[2013-08-26 08:40:16] cgoldberg: what does an element not being visible imply?  I see it in the html source, but getting: "ElementNotVisibleException: Message: u'Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with'" when selecting a link..
[2013-08-26 08:41:04] stephend, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-26 08:41:35] cgoldberg: anyone know ^^
[2013-08-26 08:41:35] jimevans: cgoldberg: element "visibility" is a tricky business.
[2013-08-26 08:41:57] phasze: Grrr, since chromedriver 2.2 I get "unable to receive message from renderer" every once in a while.  Time to spend much time getting a reproducible case...
[2013-08-26 08:42:13] cgoldberg: jimevans, hmm.. anything I can do to ensure it's visible?  or what's the tricky bit?
[2013-08-26 08:42:19] jimevans: nominally, it means "is styled such that it can be seen by the user, and can be brought into the browser viewport via normal scrolling."
[2013-08-26 08:42:33] jimevans: but that's not a precise definition.
[2013-08-26 08:42:55] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-26 08:42:58] jimevans: because "can be scrolled" is a bit of a hazy definition.
[2013-08-26 08:43:05] cgoldberg: jimevans, i also have a stacktrace from fxdriver that it spit out.. would that be useful?
[2013-08-26 08:43:19] jimevans: might be to someone. wouldn't be to me. :)
[2013-08-26 08:44:08] cgoldberg: fwiw, i'm getting this:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/6029098/

[2013-08-26 08:47:39] cgoldberg: jimevans, essentially, I think it's trying to click a link that is out of view (but should be able to be scrolled to).  that would work though, right?

[2013-08-26 08:48:59] jimevans: cgoldberg: should do. but the latest automation atoms update broke some things with scrolling in firefox. jleyba is probably our best bet to figure out what's gone wrong.
[2013-08-26 08:50:25] cgoldberg: jimevans, interesting.. that might be the prob then.  Are they fixed in trunk, or still broken?

[2013-08-26 10:07:44] Dude-X: but whether it's horrible is debatable

[2013-08-26 10:11:36] akaciccio: sorry, wrong room

[2013-08-26 10:23:34] Todd: eutheria, there is also the selenium add-ons that was talked about at the conference
[2013-08-26 10:23:45] Todd: it's basically a wrapper w/ a restful api
[2013-08-26 10:23:57] Todd: that allows you to upgrade selenium via a GET request
[2013-08-26 10:24:07] Todd: and start/stop.. do some other stuff
[2013-08-26 10:24:14] eutheria: oh oh i will wait for that

[2013-08-26 10:57:29] cgoldberg: I was gonna offer you some tips if you were using python
[2013-08-26 10:57:33] eutheria: i hated java :D until i discovered spring 3
[2013-08-26 10:58:03] cgoldberg: i hated java at first sight.. but begrudgingly used it for years
[2013-08-26 10:58:05] eutheria: i used to do stuff in python, but this is a lot more complex so java is really the tool for the job
[2013-08-26 10:58:29] ibl: i hated programming when it was introduced with java. Okay with python
[2013-08-26 10:58:29] eutheria: i could never get into java, i found it so so tiresome to get anything done in it

[2013-08-26 11:19:28] jimevans: you can use the browsermob proxy via a python wrapper, but you'll still need a jvm to execute it.

[2013-08-26 15:46:00] cgoldberg: SparkySparkyBoom, cool.  you will need wither chrome or chromium installed.  was that the missing piece?
[2013-08-26 15:46:33] SparkySparkyBoom: i think so
[2013-08-26 15:46:41] cgoldberg: SparkySparkyBoom, also, is your server headless (most likely)... a browser requires a display... so you'll need to use Xvfb to run inside a virtual X server.  It's easy to setup
[2013-08-26 15:47:16] SparkySparkyBoom: ah right i kept reading about that
[2013-08-26 15:47:26] SparkySparkyBoom: for getting screenshots with phantomjs
[2013-08-26 15:47:31] cgoldberg: SparkySparkyBoom, from python it's real simple
[2013-08-26 15:47:34] SparkySparkyBoom: i think i read a SO question about that
[2013-08-26 15:47:42] cgoldberg: well.. you can run PhantonJS.. which is headless
[2013-08-26 15:47:52] cgoldberg: or.. you can run aChrome or FF.. inside Xvfb
[2013-08-26 15:48:20] cgoldberg: SparkySparkyBoom, since your using Ubuntu and Python.. my 2 personal favs :)  I can help you get it setup
[2013-08-26 15:49:07] cgoldberg: SparkySparkyBoom, Xvfb rocks.. i run most all tests headless locally also.  get tiring to see the browser jump around :)
[2013-08-26 15:51:25] SparkySparkyBoom: thank you for the help
[2013-08-26 15:51:35] SparkySparkyBoom: i used xvfb-run
[2013-08-26 15:51:52] SparkySparkyBoom: it works beautifully
[2013-08-26 15:51:55] SparkySparkyBoom: :D
[2013-08-26 15:52:27] cgoldberg: SparkySparkyBoom, also check out xvfbwrapper, and pyvirtualdisplay  .. both are python packages that wrap Xvfb-run
[2013-08-26 15:53:20] cgoldberg: SparkySparkyBoom, you can even screenshot inside Xvfb... so I take screenshots and dump page contents on any exception

[2013-08-26 16:05:00] cgoldberg: then jenkins will automagically translate it into pretty grids and graphs
[2013-08-26 16:05:11] eutheria: didn't know that
[2013-08-26 16:05:22] eutheria: i was going to push screen shots into confluence
[2013-08-26 16:06:10] cgoldberg: you can do that too.. and delete the jenkins workspace each time... or you can just store them in Jenkins and view from there
[2013-08-26 16:06:45] cgoldberg: and jenkins will notify of regressions.. give pretty formatted stacktraces.. graphs of results.. timings, etc
[2013-08-26 16:06:59] eutheria: hmm, i didn't know jenkins could do that
[2013-08-26 16:07:14] cgoldberg: i only screenshot on errors.. and just hit up jenkins to see it
[2013-08-26 16:07:17] eutheria: i have it building some projects, but nothing much else
[2013-08-26 16:07:39] eutheria: i could raise a jira ticket on error
[2013-08-26 16:07:41] cgoldberg: yea.. it can do some neat stuff
[2013-08-26 16:07:59] cgoldberg: eutheria, yup.. you can do IRC notifications.. email notifications.. etc etc

[2013-08-26 16:08:14] cgoldberg: email links to results or regressions.. whatever
[2013-08-26 16:08:17] eutheria: not much use as i am the poor lonely coder
[2013-08-26 16:08:38] eutheria: maybe i will setup an irc server
[2013-08-26 16:08:41] cgoldberg: eutheria, ah.. yea i work on a team so it's neat.. but Jenkins is still useful as a lone coder
[2013-08-26 16:09:02] cgoldberg: eutheria, and talk to yourself? :)
[2013-08-26 16:09:08] eutheria: yes i talk to myself
[2013-08-26 16:09:30] eutheria: i have a feeling i will have someone to work with soon(ish)
[2013-08-26 16:10:05] cgoldberg: cool
[2013-08-26 16:10:24] cgoldberg: i did the lone coder thing once.. it can be tough.. better with code reviews and collaboration
[2013-08-26 16:10:37] eutheria: i hate not having someone to talk to
[2013-08-26 16:11:55] cgoldberg: eutheria, i've worked from home for past 2.5 years... so i understand isolation ;)  IRC and email/code-reviews, and an occasional voice call,  are my only means of communication
[2013-08-26 16:12:11] eutheria: exactly where i am
[2013-08-26 16:12:21] eutheria: companies i work with keep going bust
[2013-08-26 16:12:32] cgoldberg: but we have a very active private IRC server.. I couldn't imagine surviving without it
[2013-08-26 16:13:32] cgoldberg: if i ever started an engineering group or company.. irc server would be first priority.. before I even bothered with getting email service
[2013-08-26 16:13:35] eutheria: there must be some windows control scripts somewhere
[2013-08-26 16:14:05] eutheria: what i did was get a decent server from ebay and find a cheap colo for it

[2013-08-26 16:14:55] cgoldberg: eutheria, instead of cloud or VPS?  interesting
[2013-08-26 16:15:10] eutheria: i found those expensive

[2013-08-26 16:15:59] eutheria: yes your risk is higher by doing it yourself,
[2013-08-26 16:16:15] cgoldberg: depends what service level you need.. but you can have a small private VM or like 7 bucks a month.. maybe 20-30 for nice size machine at a reliable host
[2013-08-26 16:16:24] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-26 16:16:42] eutheria: yes a very small one,
[2013-08-26 16:16:58] cgoldberg: or run on a shared host for like 3 dollars a month.  depends on how important your project is and how you can  handle downtime or latency :)
[2013-08-26 16:17:08] eutheria: maybe it is cheaper in the US
[2013-08-26 16:17:32] eutheria: but i find hosting like that very restrictive
[2013-08-26 16:17:38] cgoldberg: eutheria, did you price Rackspace and AWS?  it's hard to beat what you get there.. unless you want a VPS
[2013-08-26 16:17:58] eutheria: i did a number of those services
[2013-08-26 16:18:12] cgoldberg: how much does colo cost? (just curious)
[2013-08-26 16:18:24] eutheria: i got 2 U for Â£150 a month
[2013-08-26 16:18:47] eutheria: i run a 48gb dl380
[2013-08-26 16:18:55] eutheria: bought it cheap off ebay

[2013-08-26 16:19:34] cgoldberg: scale out dude :)
[2013-08-26 16:19:34] eutheria: cause it was cheap
[2013-08-26 16:19:41] eutheria: ebay man
[2013-08-26 16:19:58] cgoldberg: 150 pounds a month, you could have like 100 VM's running :)

[2013-08-26 16:21:08] cgoldberg: i pay 30 pounds a month for my VPS in London..
[2013-08-26 16:21:20] eutheria: sounds about right

[2013-08-26 16:49:09] Ned_: is there any mechanism to "filter" an element by a CSS selector (i.e. rather than finding children/grandchildren etc, the CSS selector "starts" on the current element
[2013-08-26 16:49:12] Ned_: )

[2013-08-26 16:49:49] Ned_: for example, if I've used find_elements_by_id() to get an element, it'd be nice if I could do filter_by_css('div') to check if it's a div or not
[2013-08-26 16:50:08] Ned_: obviously that's a trivially simple example, but shows what I'm trying to do

[2013-08-26 16:52:10] Ned_: yes
[2013-08-26 16:52:12] Ned_: that's true
[2013-08-26 16:52:16] Ned_: but that's not what I'm after
[2013-08-26 16:52:25] Ned_: I'm saying, if I already have the element reference
[2013-08-26 16:52:34] Ned_: can I filter by css
[2013-08-26 16:52:36] Ned_: the existing element
[2013-08-26 16:52:45] jleyba: filter its children?
[2013-08-26 16:52:45] Ned_: it seems like a wird thing to want to do in the context above,
[2013-08-26 16:52:55] Ned_: but I'm building a framework around selenium
[2013-08-26 16:53:01] Ned_: jleyba: do you know jQuery ?
[2013-08-26 16:53:15] jleyba: sort of
[2013-08-26 16:53:17] Ned_: essentially, if you have some jquery object $stuff
[2013-08-26 16:53:24] Ned_: then, $stuff.find('selector')
[2013-08-26 16:53:31] Ned_: finds children and further descendants
[2013-08-26 16:53:34] Ned_: and that's easy in selenium too
[2013-08-26 16:53:38] Ned_: _but_
[2013-08-26 16:53:42] Ned_: $stuff.filter('selector')
[2013-08-26 16:54:00] Ned_: that's not :/, because there's no way in selenium to use a css selector on an element itself

[2013-08-26 16:56:49] Ned_: jleyba: except you've joined the two selectors together
[2013-08-26 16:56:57] Ned_: do you know a programatic way of doing that ?
[2013-08-26 16:57:37] Ned_: see, in this case, two different pieces of my code are providing those selectors
[2013-08-26 16:57:39] jleyba: divs = find_elements_by_tag_name('div')
[2013-08-26 16:57:42] Ned_: so I can't just join them together like that

[2013-08-26 16:59:23] Ned_: yup
[2013-08-26 16:59:30] jleyba: gotta run
[2013-08-26 16:59:30] Ned_: but now it's not using css selectors
