[2013-08-08 00:36:23] tshek: basically the website is using  bootstrap-fileupload.js for file upload and I am not sure what is making the input element hidden par se( opacity, parent visibility etc )
[2013-08-08 00:38:09] tshek: anyway to avoid javascript manipulation and purely work with webdriver
[2013-08-08 00:38:51] barancev|2: can you share url of a page with such an element?

[2013-08-08 00:45:23] barancev|2: tshek: which one?

[2013-08-08 00:56:26] barancev|2: yes, it's "hidden by transform", you can change it to be visible and use regular sendkeys
[2013-08-08 00:56:57] tshek: sure there is no way but to use javascript

[2013-08-08 01:05:39] barancev|2: either JS, or a tool that will handle native file uploading dialog that will appear after click to a placeholder

[2013-08-08 05:05:30] asavchuk: now iedriver supports at own 'proxy' capability - at least for manual proxy. But InternetExplorerDriver.java supports it too using old browserlauncher code - WindowsProxyManager etc

[2013-08-08 05:06:23] asavchuk: may it broke something - at selenium code or users?

[2013-08-08 05:41:55] barancev: simonstewart: removing? we usually wait two releases
[2013-08-08 05:42:02] barancev: to allow people adapt
[2013-08-08 05:42:44] simonstewart: tests running

[2013-08-08 05:44:32] simonstewart: Right. It's back
[2013-08-08 05:44:46] simonstewart: Short version with deprecation and deletion
[2013-08-08 05:44:53] simonstewart: Deprecate for a release, delete in the next
[2013-08-08 05:45:09] simonstewart: Unless we decide that it's a thing that people will find hard to cope without
[2013-08-08 05:45:17] simonstewart: And then we decide to give them extra time
[2013-08-08 05:45:30] barancev: we usually wait two. ok, a new rule is not a bad thing :)
[2013-08-08 05:45:36] simonstewart: Since the input devices were already causing grief, I just did what we normally do

[2013-08-08 05:46:50] AutomatedTester: I think a jar for 1 file is silly
[2013-08-08 05:47:27] simonstewart: I think that a protocol that's specific to a single company doesn't belong in the general repo
[2013-08-08 05:47:41] simonstewart: A jar for that company's tech make sense
[2013-08-08 05:47:49] simonstewart: No matter how many classes there are in there
[2013-08-08 05:47:54] AutomatedTester: fine
[2013-08-08 05:47:57] simonstewart: And we can then pull it in as a third party dep
[2013-08-08 05:48:07] simonstewart: Just as we do with ghostdriver
[2013-08-08 05:48:09] AutomatedTester: but then Mozilla will not be creating or maintaining it
[2013-08-08 05:48:13] simonstewart: Why not?
[2013-08-08 05:48:16] barancev: afaik we were going to implement websocket-based interface to andriod too?
[2013-08-08 05:48:25] AutomatedTester: Java is not our lingua franca
[2013-08-08 05:48:32] AutomatedTester: we have the shim and we can add that

[2013-08-08 05:48:41] simonstewart: You can host a github project though
[2013-08-08 05:48:51] simonstewart: And hardly anyone on windows has python
[2013-08-08 05:49:00] barancev: shim would be an extra layer, it is even bigger overkill
[2013-08-08 05:49:02] simonstewart: So getting grumpy about it is hurting users
[2013-08-08 05:49:10] simonstewart: shim is required by the spec
[2013-08-08 05:49:29] simonstewart: Because otherwise you lose interop
[2013-08-08 05:49:40] AutomatedTester: yea but Java is not our language
[2013-08-08 05:49:51] simonstewart: So?
[2013-08-08 05:49:55] simonstewart: Just accept patches
[2013-08-08 05:50:02] simonstewart: Mozilla's done work in java before
[2013-08-08 05:50:02] AutomatedTester: so we wont be having it in our test infrastructure
[2013-08-08 05:50:04] barancev: it Java *prohibited*?
[2013-08-08 05:50:18] barancev: s/it/is/

[2013-08-08 05:51:08] simonstewart: What does that mean?
[2013-08-08 05:51:25] simonstewart: So that means that mozilla won't host the code in a github repo?
[2013-08-08 05:51:30] simonstewart: and make the jar available?
[2013-08-08 05:51:43] AutomatedTester: we will but if we change things its up to the community to see when we break it
[2013-08-08 05:51:55] simonstewart: That's OSS
[2013-08-08 05:51:58] oliveiraev, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-08 05:52:00] barancev: simonstewart: can we set it up as a separate project on github under selenium account?
[2013-08-08 05:52:11] jamesoram, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-08 05:52:12] simonstewart: barancev: technically?
[2013-08-08 05:52:17] AutomatedTester: but this really feels like making work for the sake of making work
[2013-08-08 05:52:28] barancev: simonstewart: politically :)
[2013-08-08 05:52:33] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: long term goal of the project: the vendors own their drivers
[2013-08-08 05:52:55] AutomatedTester: so client bindings will be deleted too?
[2013-08-08 05:53:03] simonstewart: barancev: I'd prefer the vendor to own their proprietary protocol
[2013-08-08 05:53:15] simonstewart: We'll keep the remote ones
[2013-08-08 05:53:24] simonstewart: And a minimal amount of infrastructure around them
[2013-08-08 05:53:36] simonstewart: Because _everything_ will speak the wire protocl
[2013-08-08 05:53:53] simonstewart: I see the drivers becoming fairly slim.
[2013-08-08 05:54:14] AutomatedTester: and we will be supporting that but now having to support java/ruby/dotnet when we dont have people to do that seems like a lot of work
[2013-08-08 05:54:28] AutomatedTester: and I can see that community are going to get upset
[2013-08-08 05:54:35] AutomatedTester: they already hate having to download shims
[2013-08-08 05:54:47] simonstewart: Package the shim in the download?
[2013-08-08 05:54:56] simonstewart: Of Firefox
[2013-08-08 05:55:07] AutomatedTester: and mobile?
[2013-08-08 05:55:14] AutomatedTester: and Firefox OS?
[2013-08-08 05:55:30] simonstewart: Enabling the wire protocl isn't har

[2013-08-08 05:55:44] AutomatedTester: except for mobile
[2013-08-08 05:55:44] simonstewart: we've demonstrated it's possible to do it even back in the froyo days
[2013-08-08 05:55:49] simonstewart: Nonsense
[2013-08-08 05:55:56] simonstewart: I've now implemented it myself twice
[2013-08-08 05:56:14] AutomatedTester: ok, its not efficient
[2013-08-08 05:56:23] simonstewart: Moving the goal posts?
[2013-08-08 05:56:38] simonstewart: How efficient does it need to be?
[2013-08-08 05:56:44] AutomatedTester: so now we have to package a httpd in the browser?
[2013-08-08 05:56:53] simonstewart: It's not a binary encoding, but http isn't bad?

[2013-08-08 05:57:30] AutomatedTester: because Ken told me otherwise
[2013-08-08 05:57:32] simonstewart: chrome are providing a shim that people can use
[2013-08-08 05:57:35] AutomatedTester: they are moving to what we are doing
[2013-08-08 05:57:38] rananda, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-08 05:57:46] simonstewart: a self-contained binary that just needs to be put on the path
[2013-08-08 05:58:00] AutomatedTester: so how are we going to put this binary in chrome for mobile
[2013-08-08 05:58:05] AutomatedTester: ?
[2013-08-08 05:58:14] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: you're being unreasonable
[2013-08-08 05:58:24] simonstewart: what are you getting so angry about
[2013-08-08 05:58:30] AutomatedTester: im not, you said ship it with firefox
[2013-08-08 05:58:47] simonstewart: I said, right back at the start of this, "the vendor should own their driver"
[2013-08-08 05:59:00] simonstewart: You complained about the shim being a PITA to update
[2013-08-08 05:59:08] simonstewart: I suggested shipping it with the browser
[2013-08-08 05:59:18] AutomatedTester: I never said the shim is a pain to update
[2013-08-08 05:59:31] AutomatedTester: I said maintain languages we dont maintain will be a pain
[2013-08-08 05:59:34] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: they already hate having to download shims
[2013-08-08 05:59:43] AutomatedTester: we will be happy to maintain shims
[2013-08-08 06:00:02] simonstewart: So why are you getting so angry at me?
[2013-08-08 06:00:49] AutomatedTester: because maintaining java when we dont have people nor looking for people seems overkill
[2013-08-08 06:01:03] AutomatedTester: and then having to do it for .net and ruby too again overkill
[2013-08-08 06:01:12] simonstewart: Then the more productive conversation would be how to address that
[2013-08-08 06:01:17] simonstewart: rather than getting narked at me
[2013-08-08 06:01:39] AutomatedTester: but thats what I said originally

[2013-08-08 06:02:52] simonstewart: My suggestion was a project hosted "somewhere" to host that code
[2013-08-08 06:03:18] simonstewart: Which fits in well with the Mozlla ethos of OSS
[2013-08-08 06:03:38] AutomatedTester: why cant somewhere be in our tree?
[2013-08-08 06:03:54] simonstewart: I'd be more than happy to have it your tree
[2013-08-08 06:04:02] AutomatedTester: our == selenium
[2013-08-08 06:04:02] andreastt: Is that the plan for the ChromeDriverService and ChromeOptions classes as well?
[2013-08-08 06:04:03] simonstewart: That's exactly what I want :)
[2013-08-08 06:04:42] simonstewart: I see all the remote drivers becoming wrappers around a service and a config class
[2013-08-08 06:04:49] AutomatedTester: so chrome specific code parts, as andreastt points out, must be removed from the tree?
[2013-08-08 06:04:52] simonstewart: So there'll be a FirefoxService and FirefoxPreferences
[2013-08-08 06:05:04] andreastt: In which tree?
[2013-08-08 06:05:11] AutomatedTester: the selenium tree
[2013-08-08 06:05:14] simonstewart: Right
[2013-08-08 06:05:23] AutomatedTester: ok, so we will do a FirefoxService item
[2013-08-08 06:05:28] AutomatedTester: which will start the shim
[2013-08-08 06:05:31] simonstewart: Right
[2013-08-08 06:05:36] andreastt: Sure, that makes sense.  Then have that communicate with an HTTP server that maps down to whatever proprietary remote control protocol the vendor uses.

[2013-08-08 06:06:06] elopio, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-08 06:06:15] simonstewart: Ultimately, what we want is the remote webdriver and APIs that make using that nice on the languages
[2013-08-08 06:06:17] AutomatedTester: I see people forking our repo to put in a marionetteconnection code
[2013-08-08 06:06:20] andreastt: So the problem in this case is that Firefox doesn't speak the HTTP JSON wire protocol out of the box
[2013-08-08 06:06:26] simonstewart: Right
[2013-08-08 06:06:26] AutomatedTester: and using the fork
[2013-08-08 06:06:48] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: not if the marionetteconnection is in the mozilla code base
[2013-08-08 06:06:52] simonstewart: (as you just suggested)
[2013-08-08 06:07:04] simonstewart: And there's nothing to stop us including it as a third-party jar
[2013-08-08 06:07:09] simonstewart: So they'll have access to it
[2013-08-08 06:07:19] AutomatedTester: full circle, we wont have that in our tree
[2013-08-08 06:07:41] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: why cant somewhere be in our tree?
[2013-08-08 06:07:51] simonstewart: That's literally what you just said
[2013-08-08 06:08:05] AutomatedTester: when I say our I mean the selenium tree
[2013-08-08 06:08:15] AutomatedTester: otherwise I will call it m-c
[2013-08-08 06:08:23] AutomatedTester: marionetteconnection will not be in m-c
[2013-08-08 06:08:25] simonstewart: OK. The clarification helps
[2013-08-08 06:08:33] simonstewart: Youd been speaking as "mozilla" when you said that
[2013-08-08 06:08:43] simonstewart: (or, rather, that's how I was reading it)
[2013-08-08 06:08:59] AutomatedTester: we will offer the shim, like chrome, and have a service
[2013-08-08 06:09:03] simonstewart: OK
[2013-08-08 06:09:16] qba73, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-08 06:09:26] AutomatedTester: but for a simple transport layer its a shame that people cant use it directly
[2013-08-08 06:09:46] simonstewart: And host the marionetteconnection in a github repo owned by mozilla, but contributed to by the community?
[2013-08-08 06:09:59] simonstewart: Which we can then pull in as a third-party repo
[2013-08-08 06:10:01] AutomatedTester: for ruby and .net too?
[2013-08-08 06:10:13] simonstewart: Yes
[2013-08-08 06:10:22] AutomatedTester: and <insert another language> as people create bindings
[2013-08-08 06:10:30] simonstewart: If people donate the code
[2013-08-08 06:10:46] simonstewart: Personally, I'd stop at the ones that the selenium project ships with
[2013-08-08 06:10:47] AutomatedTester: I am not understanding why we cant keep it with the people who understand it best
[2013-08-08 06:10:51] cgoldberg, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-08 06:11:00] simonstewart: because mozilla understand their protocol best
[2013-08-08 06:11:18] simonstewart: it's your protocol
[2013-08-08 06:11:25] AutomatedTester: but now to handle reviews we need to understand the language
[2013-08-08 06:11:26] simonstewart: mozilla's, that is
[2013-08-08 06:11:34] simonstewart: I can help
[2013-08-08 06:11:37] simonstewart: I have no problem with that
[2013-08-08 06:11:44] andreastt: So we decided to not put OperaDriver in the Selenium repo to begin with, later we also removed it as a dependency.  The situation here is not any different IMO.
[2013-08-08 06:12:00] simonstewart: agreed
[2013-08-08 06:12:03] andreastt: The people who have done work on it are still Selenium people.
[2013-08-08 06:12:06] AutomatedTester: andreastt: but your protobuff code wasnt a single file doing simple things
[2013-08-08 06:12:24] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: doesn't matter
[2013-08-08 06:12:32] simonstewart: it's a proprietary protocol
[2013-08-08 06:12:41] simonstewart: that's owned, controlled and developed by mozilla
[2013-08-08 06:12:55] simonstewart: Just because it happens to work one way now doesn't mean it won't in the future
[2013-08-08 06:13:14] simonstewart: If you're concerned about efficiency, I foresee a push towards a binary encoding
[2013-08-08 06:13:22] andreastt: I don't think the difference from status quo is going to be very big regardless of what we do here.
[2013-08-08 06:13:37] andreastt: If anything it's going to make people's perception of “drivers” clearer.
[2013-08-08 06:13:40] AutomatedTester: ok, we will offer shim and leave it there
[2013-08-08 06:13:53] simonstewart: Why not the OSS project for the other languages?
[2013-08-08 06:14:16] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: it seems inconsistent to say "think of the users" when someone else will be hosting the code
[2013-08-08 06:14:31] simonstewart: but to say "forget about the users" when mozilla will host the code
[2013-08-08 06:14:48] AutomatedTester: i am not saying forget the users
[2013-08-08 06:14:55] simonstewart: As andreastt points out, this is the same as the operadriver
[2013-08-08 06:15:10] simonstewart: where the code was hosted as an opera github project
[2013-08-08 06:15:20] AutomatedTester: we will give the shim, as andreastt did and ken does, that will be hosted under Mozilla
[2013-08-08 06:15:25] simonstewart: but worked on by selenium people (admittedly, almost entirely andreastt :)
[2013-08-08 06:15:36] simonstewart: And the place for the other language bindings?
[2013-08-08 06:15:36] bimmelino, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-08 06:15:55] AutomatedTester: that can be handled as FirefoxService and FIrefoxPrefences
[2013-08-08 06:15:56] simonstewart: We can move the existing MarionetteConnection to the mozilla hosted git repo
[2013-08-08 06:16:01] AutomatedTester: which fits the current model
[2013-08-08 06:16:17] AutomatedTester: and then the language owners can make the updates, like the current model
[2013-08-08 06:16:34] simonstewart: one moment

[2013-08-08 06:18:58] barancev: and they will have to use either "python shim" or "java shim" anyway
[2013-08-08 06:19:08] simonstewart: ddary: it's something that translates from the JSON wire protocol to some other protocol

[2013-08-08 07:18:31] asavchuk: jimevans: hi! it was decided ( simonstewart ) to support on java both: old iedriver which could not setup proxy and new which could. for that i need to know version of iedriver _before_ it is started :) I'm going to add /version switch to IEDriverServer.exe and parse it in java. Do you have some special opinion for this?
[2013-08-08 07:20:35] jimevans: asavchuk: let me think on that one for a bit.
[2013-08-08 07:21:08] AutomatedTester: cant you just send a desiredcapability about it?
[2013-08-08 07:21:16] AutomatedTester: if its handled, awesome, if not so bad
[2013-08-08 07:22:44] rbalent, quitting. (Quit: May the Force be with you)
[2013-08-08 07:23:34] asavchuk: hm. for  "if not" case, as i understand, it's expected to set proxy by old java code. but it may be not possible (or not?) due browser is already started and i'm not sure that changes which do hudsuckr.exe will be applied to existed browser window.
[2013-08-08 07:24:15] jimevans: AutomatedTester: it's not quite that simple. the IE driver now sets the proxy for itself before the browser is launched. the java bindings need to know that an old version of the IE driver won't set the proxy when launched, so it can set the proxy for itself.
[2013-08-08 07:24:32] AutomatedTester: ooooo
[2013-08-08 07:24:36] AutomatedTester: dont mind me then
[2013-08-08 07:24:42] asavchuk: could someone clarify behavour: when browser started hudsuck.exe can change its proxy settings ?
[2013-08-08 07:25:03] jimevans: asavchuk: global proxy changes can be propagated throughout the system by calling the WinINet api.
[2013-08-08 07:26:09] jawr: shouldn't ele.click() trigger any js associated with that event?
[2013-08-08 07:26:28] jawr: i.e. click()'ing a checkbox
[2013-08-08 07:26:43] papegaaij, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-08-08 07:26:59] jimevans: so, theoretically, the java bindings could launch the IE driver, check the returned version in the capabilities of the session, and if they're earlier than 2.33.0.9, set the proxy using WindowsProxyManager and notify all open windows by calling the Windows (wininet) InternetSetOption API with the right settings.
[2013-08-08 07:30:10] qaguy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-08-08 07:31:09] jawr: is there a more explicit way of clicking, i.e. using a hover and then clicking that way?
[2013-08-08 07:31:25] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-08 07:31:28] jawr: can't understand why a jquery plugin works if i click on an input box, but if i click the element from selenium it doesn't
[2013-08-08 07:32:35] asavchuk: "calling the Windows (wininet) InternetSetOption API with the right settings" - am i right that java should call WinAPI?
[2013-08-08 07:32:59] jimevans: asavchuk: that would be the correct pattern, yes.
[2013-08-08 07:34:14] asavchuk: hm. what does this solution to be better that /version switch and parsing it at java and to decide basing on result ?
[2013-08-08 07:34:20] jimevans: you'd want to do the java equivalent of InternetSetOption(NULL, INTERNET_OPTION_PROXY_SETTINGS_CHANGED, NULL, 0);
[2013-08-08 07:35:22] jimevans: because it's a simple api call, and it doesn't require a hack in IEDriverServer

[2013-08-08 07:37:45] jimevans: asavchuk: additionally, the java language bindings *should* already encapsulate this api call somewhere. if they don't, they're setting the proxy incorrectly.
[2013-08-08 07:39:13] asavchuk: jimevans: java manipulates proxy by registry changes and hudsuckr.exe utility call :) it doesn't query WinAPI.
[2013-08-08 07:39:38] jimevans: asavchuk: then java bindings are wrong.
[2013-08-08 07:39:40] jimevans: :)
[2013-08-08 07:40:08] asavchuk: ;)
[2013-08-08 07:41:03] jimevans: manipulating the registry is fine (it's not exactly correct, but it'll get the job done), but there should be a call to InternetSetOption to notify applications that the proxy settings have changed.
[2013-08-08 07:41:34] cgoldberg, quitting. (Quit: Ex-Chat)
[2013-08-08 07:41:50] asavchuk: i think, it is done by hudsucrk.exe
[2013-08-08 07:42:13] asavchuk: ok, i'l try to do right thing :)
[2013-08-08 07:42:21] jimevans: and like i said, it's a simple API call. InternetSetOption takes several pointers to structures, but they're all NULL when using the option to notify of proxy settings changes (INTERNET_OPTION_PROXY_SETTINGS_CHANGED)
[2013-08-08 07:42:50] asavchuk: yes, i see. thanks.

[2013-08-08 08:31:00] simonstewart: Fire away
[2013-08-08 08:31:08] jimevans: so we're going to wrap the mozilla shim then?
[2013-08-08 08:31:12] simonstewart: Yes
[2013-08-08 08:31:26] simonstewart: And pull in the MarionetteConnection as a third party library
[2013-08-08 08:31:31] jimevans: from the .net bindings perspective i have an issue with that.
[2013-08-08 08:31:35] simonstewart: ok
[2013-08-08 08:31:40] simonstewart: Talk to me
[2013-08-08 08:31:47] jimevans: to run the mozilla shim, you must have a python runtime.
[2013-08-08 08:32:04] jimevans: (their http server is developed in python)
[2013-08-08 08:32:11] simonstewart: That's true.
[2013-08-08 08:32:18] simonstewart: I hope that mozilla will Think Of The Users
[2013-08-08 08:32:27] simonstewart: But, yes, their shim is python
[2013-08-08 08:32:37] jimevans: that means a pure .net solution (where "pure" means "only require the .net runtime") can't be done if that's our approach.
[2013-08-08 08:32:52] simonstewart: So the C# MarionetteConnection could also live in the mozilla git repo
[2013-08-08 08:32:56] simonstewart: (whereever it may be)
[2013-08-08 08:33:03] simonstewart: And we can pull it in as a dependency
[2013-08-08 08:33:08] simonstewart: Just as we do with Java
[2013-08-08 08:33:15] simonstewart: s/do/will do/
[2013-08-08 08:33:19] jimevans: okay, now i'm more confused.
[2013-08-08 08:33:24] simonstewart: About?

[2013-08-08 08:33:42] simonstewart: Think of it this way: "who owns the code?"
[2013-08-08 08:33:44] jimevans: if we're using the connection class as a dependency, then we're not wrapping the shim.
[2013-08-08 08:33:55] simonstewart: My plan in Java land is to do both
[2013-08-08 08:33:57] jimevans: i'm clearly missing something here.
[2013-08-08 08:34:05] jimevans: ah.
[2013-08-08 08:34:08] jimevans: i seee.
[2013-08-08 08:34:15] simonstewart: In javaland I'll sniff to see if the marionetteconncetion is available
[2013-08-08 08:34:18] simonstewart: and use that if it is
[2013-08-08 08:34:28] simonstewart: Otherwise, I'll use the service wrapping the shim
[2013-08-08 08:35:15] simonstewart: Does that make it a little clearer?
[2013-08-08 08:35:21] simonstewart: (Hoping it does)
[2013-08-08 08:35:24] simonstewart: :)
[2013-08-08 08:35:54] simonstewart: The implementation of the Mozilla protocol is a mozilla thing (though we're planning on pitching in).
[2013-08-08 08:36:10] jimevans: i'm still having trouble visualizing it. if you have the MarionetteConnection class available, there's no need to start the shim.
[2013-08-08 08:36:18] simonstewart: That's right
[2013-08-08 08:36:31] simonstewart: But not every language will have the native connection class
[2013-08-08 08:36:42] simonstewart: And there's always the case where the protocol changes
[2013-08-08 08:36:55] simonstewart: So the shim would work, but the connection wouldn't
[2013-08-08 08:37:41] jimevans: i'm till confused. let me try to articulate where i'm having trouble (no guarantees i'll be able to)
[2013-08-08 08:37:56] simonstewart: Sure
[2013-08-08 08:38:08] stackedsax, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-08-08 08:38:21] jimevans: in the java case, you'll never use the shim. MarionetteConnection is a class internal to java, so it'll always be available to java.
[2013-08-08 08:38:39] jimevans: other languages will have to make a decision whether to create a native connection class or to use the shim.
[2013-08-08 08:38:53] simonstewart: Ah
[2013-08-08 08:39:04] p0deje, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-08 08:39:12] jimevans: in the case where the other languages want to create a native connection class, we're deciding not to host that code in the webdriver project.
[2013-08-08 08:39:21] p0deje, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2013-08-08 08:39:27] simonstewart: In javaland, I plan on providing a DriverService and making its usage optional should I detect the MarionetteCOnnection on the classpath
[2013-08-08 08:39:35] simonstewart: jimevans: right
[2013-08-08 08:39:50] simonstewart: The code would live in mozilla git repo (whereever it's hosted)
[2013-08-08 08:39:55] simonstewart: (probably *sigh* github)
[2013-08-08 08:40:21] asavchuk: simonstewart:  jimevans: could you answer to my question about another potential ie proxy solution - is it good or wrong ?

[2013-08-08 08:40:52] simonstewart: asavchuk: seems like a reasonable approach to me
[2013-08-08 08:40:55] jimevans: i see. so you're not planning on bundling marionetteconnection with webdriver releases? or you are? if so, how would you get to a situation where you wouldn't have it available? unless there's a "bare-bones, only what we provide" version of the java bindings.
[2013-08-08 08:41:05] *jimevans shows his java ignorance.'
[2013-08-08 08:42:08] asavchuk: good.
[2013-08-08 08:42:09] jimevans: s/wouldn't have it available/wouldn't have it on the classpath/
[2013-08-08 08:42:16] simonstewart: jimevans: the marionetteconnection will be included in the releases (as a third-party jar, like guava). There are a few places where it might not work, notably if there's something that breaks the ABI
[2013-08-08 08:42:33] simonstewart: So instantiating the connection would be done via reflection
[2013-08-08 08:42:40] asavchuk: * be right back in a hour.
[2013-08-08 08:42:43] asavchuk, quitting. (Quit: bye, everyone)
[2013-08-08 08:43:06] simonstewart: If that fails, we fall back to the service
[2013-08-08 08:43:24] simonstewart: And if people don't have the connection for some reason (downloaded from maven?)
[2013-08-08 08:43:33] jleyba: if marionette has any java code that will not live in our code base, i hope it doesn't use any interfaces from org.openqa.selenium
[2013-08-08 08:43:41] simonstewart: Then we can use the shim without needing to terrify the user
[2013-08-08 08:43:52] jleyba: keep the dependency  chain one way
[2013-08-08 08:44:04] simonstewart: jleyba: that's why our interfaces don't depend on any third party libraries
[2013-08-08 08:44:22] simonstewart: They'll need to implement the CommandExecutor interface
[2013-08-08 08:44:33] jlipps, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-08 08:44:46] simonstewart: So need Command, Response and CommandExecutor
[2013-08-08 08:44:47] jleyba: simonstewart: then we need to freeze our interfaces
[2013-08-08 08:44:52] sr78ger, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-08 08:45:00] jimevans: i think i get it now. what i suspect i'll end up doing is a native connection class for .net, which will get ilmerge'd into the WebDriver.dll assembly (so as to keep the single-assembly approach)
[2013-08-08 08:45:02] simonstewart: See early comments in thread re: ABI
[2013-08-08 08:45:14] jleyba: and not move them to new packages and change signatures...as a certain someone did with Mouse and Keyboard and broke the OperaDriver for 2.34.0

[2013-08-08 11:42:53] Dude-X: well when you start firefox via the firefox driver, it creates the profile first and sets it. then it shuts down and then restarts firefox with that profile

[2013-08-08 14:06:25] jimevans: (meaning reproducible)
[2013-08-08 14:06:28] cgoldberg: lukeis, so selenium uses google code for source hosting?  I thought when it moved to git, it also moved to GitHub.

[2013-08-08 14:06:35] fijiaaron: If you teach me how to build successfully, I'll try to tackle some other pissant maintenance ones
[2013-08-08 14:06:39] lukeis: 270 Needs Clarification
[2013-08-08 14:06:44] jimevans: cgoldberg: we mirror the project on github.
[2013-08-08 14:06:52] jimevans: here's the party line.
[2013-08-08 14:07:19] lukeis: we started the github clone to allow users to issue Pull Requests (the most desired feature)
[2013-08-08 14:07:33] cgoldberg: because GitHub's integration for code reviews/issues/pull-requests is freakin awesome
[2013-08-08 14:07:36] lukeis: google code PR is clunky at best
[2013-08-08 14:08:09] jimevans: google has made massive contributions in manpower, server space, and project visibility. we use google code as our repository as a way of respecting that contribution.
[2013-08-08 14:08:15] lukeis: issues are just fine in googlecode, not really any different from github
[2013-08-08 14:08:29] lukeis: in fact better on googlecode… easier to search
[2013-08-08 14:09:16] lukeis: code reivews… well, if it wasn't semi-broken on googlecode, i'd be happy with it
[2013-08-08 14:09:26] cgoldberg: I moved off google code about a year ago for personal projects.. and am still blown away by how nice GitHub is
[2013-08-08 14:09:41] lukeis: (sometimes you can comment on a line of code and it will attach itself to a different code revision)
[2013-08-08 14:09:53] cgoldberg: though I use Launchpad and bzr for daily "work"
[2013-08-08 14:09:59] lukeis: yeah, I use GitHub for personal stuff too
[2013-08-08 14:15:11] barancev|2: lukeis: yes, I can reproduce the xpath issue in FF23 and the current version of IDE
[2013-08-08 14:16:03] lukeis: but that sounds more like a FF bug, than anything we can do with selenium?
[2013-08-08 14:16:21] lukeis: (aka, should it hold up the 2.35 release?)
[2013-08-08 14:16:26] barancev|2: from the FF console document.evaluate works as expected
[2013-08-08 14:16:30] lukeis: ah
[2013-08-08 14:16:42] lukeis: can you add a failing test?
[2013-08-08 14:16:49] barancev|2: it is IDE + Core issue
[2013-08-08 14:16:56] barancev|2: not related to WebDriver at all
[2013-08-08 14:16:56] lukeis: not in WD?
[2013-08-08 14:17:00] lukeis: ahh, ok
[2013-08-08 14:17:14] lukeis: who cares about that then? :-P
[2013-08-08 14:17:38] barancev|2: so we can recommend all RC users to downdrate FF because thy use ancient seleniгm

[2013-08-08 14:18:36] barancev|2: who cares... well... the letter about 10 millions of IDE downloads makes me think...

[2013-08-08 14:19:21] lukeis: well, every user downloads a new version with each version of firefox
[2013-08-08 14:19:32] lukeis: so 10 mil / 20
[2013-08-08 14:19:40] lukeis: still quite a bit ;)

[2013-08-08 14:20:07] lukeis: or maybe they don't
[2013-08-08 14:20:15] lukeis: forgets how the plugins work
[2013-08-08 14:20:41] lukeis: ah, every version of the plugin ;)
[2013-08-08 14:20:42] barancev|2: new FF version inherits all installed plugins

[2013-08-08 14:23:44] barancev|2: neverheless, we can do 2.35 because this xpath bug is not a regression issue
[2013-08-08 14:24:09] lukeis: sounds like a regression
[2013-08-08 14:24:10] barancev|2: older firefoxes are ok
[2013-08-08 14:24:22] barancev|2: it is ff23 specific issue
[2013-08-08 14:24:24] lukeis: yeah, but we usually hold up to fix new issues with the new version
[2013-08-08 14:25:50] barancev|2: al least I know where in the code it sits

[2013-08-08 14:26:56] barancev|2: this.doc.evaluate returns null for some reason there
[2013-08-08 14:27:01] barancev|2: for a valid xpath
[2013-08-08 14:27:28] barancev|2: and I have no idea why this happens
[2013-08-08 14:28:15] lukeis: probably need to figure out what this.doc really is
[2013-08-08 14:28:48] barancev|2: it return null even for //* query

[2013-08-08 14:38:42] barancev|2: so the issue is in namespaceResolver not the this.doc

[2013-08-08 15:05:03] barancev|2: and I should note that MDN documentation of document.evaluate is wrong about this parameter
[2013-08-08 15:06:28] barancev|2: 2.35 will fix this issue in RC, and we need another IDE release
[2013-08-08 15:06:39] lukeis: ping samit
