[2013-08-01 05:43:58] simonstewart: 'sup?
[2013-08-01 05:44:25] jimevans: simonstewart: so i recently implemented a native setting of proxy information in IEDriverServer.exe.
[2013-08-01 05:44:37] jimevans: works great in my environment, under the .NET bindings.
[2013-08-01 05:44:40] simonstewart: Sounds good
[2013-08-01 05:45:08] jimevans: can set either the system proxy (default), or hack a per-process proxy that affects only the specific instance of IE.
[2013-08-01 05:45:29] jimevans: but it fails miserably under the java language bindings.
[2013-08-01 05:45:36] jimevans: i think i've managed to disable all of the WindowsProxyManager stuff
[2013-08-01 05:45:53] jimevans: but the InternetSetOption API call is still failing in the C++ code.

[2013-08-01 05:47:03] simonstewart: Interesting
[2013-08-01 05:47:46] jimevans: so i'm wondering if (1) maybe i *haven't* properly disabled all of that, or (2) something the java bindings are doing is different.
[2013-08-01 05:48:17] simonstewart: Good question.
[2013-08-01 05:48:40] simonstewart: From memory, you probably want to nuke some of the code from RC which is referred to in the IE driver constructor

[2013-08-01 05:51:19] simonstewart: Right. So it should be enough to nuke the WindowsProxyManager

[2013-08-01 05:52:13] jimevans: looks like. i've pretty much commented out all of the references to it in InternetExplorerDriver.java that i can see.
[2013-08-01 05:52:39] jimevans: but i can delete those references too and see what happens.
[2013-08-01 05:52:47] simonstewart: It might be easier to remove the functionality from the proxy manager itself rather than commenting out code in the prepareProxy method

[2013-08-01 06:17:43] simonstewart: FTR, you're going through the UnixProcess right now when starting the IEDriverService.exe
[2013-08-01 06:18:07] simonstewart: Question: what happens when you run the IEDriverServer.exe by hand and just connect to that?
[2013-08-01 06:18:19] jimevans: haven't tried that yet.
[2013-08-01 06:19:10] simonstewart: Might be a low friction thing to try
[2013-08-01 06:19:12] jimevans: not even sure really how to make that work for my java environment (which is non-existent on this machine)
[2013-08-01 06:19:23] simonstewart: Hmmm...
[2013-08-01 06:19:28] simonstewart: Start the server
[2013-08-01 06:19:35] cmcgraw, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-01 06:19:38] simonstewart: then just create a bare bones RemoteWebDriver pointing at it?
[2013-08-01 06:19:43] jimevans: fwiw, i'm relying on ProxySettingTest to validate this.
[2013-08-01 06:19:48] simonstewart: But passing in the proxy through the desired capabilities?
[2013-08-01 06:20:06] simonstewart: OK. Then we're good
[2013-08-01 06:20:26] simonstewart: Other question: is the IEDriverServer.exe seeing the proxy as it comes across the wire?
[2013-08-01 06:20:27] jimevans: the test should fail (because IE doesn't understand required capabilities), but it should still set the proxy when passed.
[2013-08-01 06:20:43] simonstewart: k
[2013-08-01 06:21:02] simonstewart: Manual test with IEDriverServer.exe and a RemoteWebDriver would be my next step
[2013-08-01 06:21:19] jimevans: yes. i'm validating that the proxy settings are what we expect them to be, and that the proxy string built by the IEDriverServer ProxyManager class is the correct one for InternetSetOption. the api call just fails.
[2013-08-01 06:21:23] simonstewart: Since that allows us to narrow the problem down to either the server or the way that we're starting the server
[2013-08-01 06:21:32] simonstewart: ugh
[2013-08-01 06:21:32] jimevans: but you've given me a lot more to go on.

[2013-08-01 08:50:55] jimevans: barancev: i don't think he's worried so much about me, but anyone else who'd work on the IE driver java bindings.
[2013-08-01 08:51:17] daemon: barancev, this is a bit of an odd thing to ask but im a new selenium users (literally 15 minutes ago) was it not a little odd to ship 2.33 with such a massive bug
[2013-08-01 08:51:46] barancev: daemon: 2.33 was shipped 2 months ago
[2013-08-01 08:52:04] jimevans: daemon: careful now. you realize none of the people who actually develop selenium are paid to do it, right?
[2013-08-01 08:52:20] barancev: later firefiox shipped version 22 and broke selenium
[2013-08-01 08:52:22] daemon: jimevans, im not paid to work on any of my perl projects or freebsd ones either but it is still a valid question
[2013-08-01 08:52:36] daemon: barancev, ah so the firefox update broken it
[2013-08-01 08:52:47] daemon: hmm might be easier getting an older version of ff
[2013-08-01 08:52:48] p0deje, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-01 08:53:24] barancev: yes, is not an excuse for us, I understand, but firefox releases are too often these days :)
[2013-08-01 08:53:55] barancev: yes, you can run your tests on FF21, it is free of this issue
[2013-08-01 08:54:15] barancev: and we are doing our best to ship 2.34
[2013-08-01 08:54:29] daemon: ok this is odd the last version of firefox I can get is 2.00
[2013-08-01 08:54:30] jimevans: daemon: it's a valid question, but before you accuse people who volunteer their time and effort on a project of "ship[ing with a] massive bug", i'm just suggesting treading a little carefully how you phrase it, is all.
[2013-08-01 08:54:33] daemon: Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.20

[2013-08-01 08:54:57] barancev: jimevans: ok, I'll roll it back, and I'll implement a new crazyfun option to set this capability to true (default to false)
[2013-08-01 08:55:04] daemon: argh how many version of firefox are ther
[2013-08-01 08:55:04] barancev: simonstewart: ^^^
[2013-08-01 08:55:42] simonstewart: barancev: seems reasonable
[2013-08-01 08:55:58] barancev: deal
[2013-08-01 08:56:13] daemon: barancev, looking at the release history for firefox I see your point :)

[2013-08-01 08:56:54] barancev: daemon: opera 12 only (presto-based)
[2013-08-01 08:57:07] daemon: does it need anything special and or are there any problems using it?
[2013-08-01 08:57:18] barancev: new opere 15 (blink-based) is not supported yet

[2013-08-01 11:36:44] jimevans: nirvdrum: per-instance proxy settings in IE.
[2013-08-01 11:36:49] nirvdrum: No shit?
[2013-08-01 11:36:51] nirvdrum: How?
[2013-08-01 11:37:14] nirvdrum: I was about to resort to using virtual registries.
[2013-08-01 11:37:31] lukeis: barancev: ok, i thought i saw something about that… but can't that be fixed in the non-java implementations? and I think that's only ruby ;)
[2013-08-01 11:37:54] barancev: may be ruby only

[2013-08-01 11:39:02] nirvdrum: jimevans: So did you just end up registering another hook?
[2013-08-01 11:39:14] barancev: lukeis: if you want to look at this test -- you're welcome!
[2013-08-01 11:39:16] jimevans: nirvdrum: you can thank eric lawrence (formerly of the IE team, currently of telerik) for that little idea.
[2013-08-01 11:39:19] jimevans: and yes.
[2013-08-01 11:39:40] nirvdrum: Funky.  I thought hooks were just for message interception.
[2013-08-01 11:39:48] lukeis: barancev: for what browser/version ?
[2013-08-01 11:39:48] barancev: i'll be busy for an hour, later will be back to selenium
[2013-08-01 11:39:56] nirvdrum: jimevans: That's pretty awesome though.
[2013-08-01 11:39:56] barancev: lukeis: it is a mocked test
[2013-08-01 11:39:59] lukeis: ok
[2013-08-01 11:40:10] jimevans: nirvdrum: well this one is for that, but i'm sending a custom message to IE, which I intercept along the way. :)
[2013-08-01 11:40:13] nirvdrum: jimevans: Do you have a commit or set of commits I can look at?
[2013-08-01 11:40:23] nirvdrum: Ahh :-)
[2013-08-01 11:40:25] nirvdrum: Clever indeed.
[2013-08-01 11:40:39] jimevans: you can grab the latest IEDriverServer out of the prebuilts in the repo.
[2013-08-01 11:40:57] nirvdrum: I went nuts trying to figure that out.  I was quite certain proxies could be set per process.  But I couldn't find any sort of QI work I could do to set it.
[2013-08-01 11:41:08] nirvdrum: jimevans: I wanted to see the actual code ;-)
[2013-08-01 11:41:12] jimevans: set the "proxy" capability for proxy settings, and the "ie.usePerProcessProxy" capability to true to enable the code.
[2013-08-01 11:41:13] nirvdrum: I'll just go through git.
[2013-08-01 11:41:17] jimevans: look at the ProxyManager class.
[2013-08-01 11:41:19] jimevans: it's all in there.
[2013-08-01 11:41:24] nirvdrum: Sweet.  Thanks.
[2013-08-01 11:41:35] jimevans: np
[2013-08-01 11:41:45] nirvdrum: Safari could benefit from something similar.  But I don't know how popular Safari on Windows actually is.
[2013-08-01 11:42:23] nirvdrum: jimevans: Any similar trick to do per-process cookies? :-P
[2013-08-01 11:42:24] jimevans: you could probably pull off the same trick there.
[2013-08-01 11:42:35] jimevans: nirvdrum: i'm not touching cookies. :)
[2013-08-01 11:42:43] nirvdrum: I do a similar hook trick to do screenshots on Windows safari.
[2013-08-01 11:42:56] nirvdrum: I basically ported snapsie to NPAPI by using Firebreath.
[2013-08-01 11:43:00] jimevans: neat
[2013-08-01 11:43:11] nirvdrum: I haven't shared it though because invariably someone will try to use it on Mac and it won't work.
[2013-08-01 11:43:13] asavchuk: nirvdrum: there is -private cmd arg for per-process cookie ;)
[2013-08-01 11:43:31] jimevans: yeah, there is that.
[2013-08-01 11:43:49] nirvdrum: asavchuk: Does it work?  Francois seemed to think that didn't really do what it's supposed to.
[2013-08-01 11:44:04] nirvdrum: I'm fortunate in that I tend to test different sites at once, so shared cookies isn't a huge deal.
[2013-08-01 11:44:23] asavchuk: should, as i know. we use it for run multiple IEs at node.
[2013-08-01 11:44:39] nirvdrum: jimevans: I still need to get to the bottom of the screenshot code breaking in IE 10.  But I'm in the process of a big move off EC2, so I haven't been able to look into it.
[2013-08-01 11:45:11] nirvdrum: asavchuk: How do you set the command-line args?  I assume there's a capability for it.
[2013-08-01 11:45:39] jimevans: nirvdrum: if you figure it out, let me know. IE 11 suffers from the same problem, or so i hear.
[2013-08-01 11:45:49] nirvdrum: Cute.
[2013-08-01 11:45:50] jimevans: (which isn't surprising)
[2013-08-01 11:45:55] nirvdrum: What's odd is it used to work fine.
[2013-08-01 11:46:12] nirvdrum: I'm not sure if something changed in a Windows update or if something changed in Selenium.  I fear it's the former.
[2013-08-01 11:46:45] asavchuk: capabilities forceCreateProcess=true and internetExplorerSwitches=-private should be set. also special registry keyTabProcGrowth=0 should be set.
[2013-08-01 11:48:29] asavchuk: from my point of view, problem with IE10/IE11 screenshot have the x64 source. at least it is not reproduced for x32 IE10 machines.

[2013-08-01 12:34:31] nirvdrum: lukeis: I guess that would be my vote.  But maybe GitHub won't bite me again.  They just have a history of doing it.
[2013-08-01 12:34:34] lukeis: it looks like you have to tag / upload at the same time… i don't see a UI to update a tag post tagging
[2013-08-01 12:34:52] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: tag an upload
[2013-08-01 12:35:10] nirvdrum: So the uploaded file becomes part of the repo?
[2013-08-01 12:35:11] AutomatedTester: and nirvdrum Google and github both have a bad history of killing useful things
[2013-08-01 12:35:17] mansi: @andreastt: - Is this the xml namespace we were talking about this morning? "<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:dd="MyApp">"
[2013-08-01 12:35:22] lukeis: nirvdrum: i still have issues figuring out how to host on seleniumhq.org … i don't want to check in all the released artificats over all time in our sites repo o.0
[2013-08-01 12:35:30] mansi: I have it in the css doc already
[2013-08-01 12:35:31] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I concur.  I don't think hopping from one to the other is a good mitigation strategy.
[2013-08-01 12:35:54] asavchuk: jimevans: ok, looks good - no error at setting proxy for both global and per-process cases. per-process works fine. but for global case it sets not existed proxy (i see it at IE settings) and _successfully_ open page.
[2013-08-01 12:36:04] nirvdrum: lukeis: S3 would be a good bet.
[2013-08-01 12:36:17] asavchuk: even more - if i set manually at IE settings not existed proxy and open page - it opened :)
[2013-08-01 12:36:17] jimevans: asavchuk: \o/
[2013-08-01 12:36:18] lukeis: then we'd need to start paying for that too
[2013-08-01 12:36:24] asavchuk: looks like my machine issue.
[2013-08-01 12:36:40] nirvdrum: The project makes money.  But even then, the cost is stupidly low.
[2013-08-01 12:36:59] foundatron, quitting. (Quit: Computer has gone to sleep.)
[2013-08-01 12:37:09] asavchuk: so from my point of view, IEDriver has support for proxy. Congrats! jimevans you are great!

[2013-08-01 12:38:00] nirvdrum: jimevans: I don't suppose anyone updated RWD to not create the proxy registry entries for IE, did they?
[2013-08-01 12:38:15] jimevans: nirvdrum: not yet. :)
[2013-08-01 12:38:17] mansi: @andreastt: - Just ignore, I got what you we were talking about.
[2013-08-01 12:38:22] nirvdrum: Or rather, if that capability is set.  Flat out removing it would likely break a lot of people.
[2013-08-01 12:38:34] davidlai, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-08-01 12:40:11] asavchuk: nirvdrum: hm. not sure that someone could normally use different proxy at the same machine with IE and old ProxyManager code.
[2013-08-01 12:40:39] nirvdrum: asavchuk: Not different, but it would set up a proxy.
[2013-08-01 12:40:45] asavchuk: nirvdrum: oh, of course i said about grid
[2013-08-01 12:40:47] nirvdrum: All IE instances would share that same proxy.
[2013-08-01 12:41:11] asavchuk: it has a bug - it not cleaned up at driver exit
[2013-08-01 12:41:21] nirvdrum: That would probably conflict with the new proxy stuff.  But flat out deleting the old implementation would really break people.
[2013-08-01 12:41:21] asavchuk: only at grid node shutdown
[2013-08-01 12:41:38] nirvdrum: At least until this is promoted as the default proxy handler.
[2013-08-01 12:42:20] asavchuk: ok. then how we avoid this breaking ?
[2013-08-01 12:42:21] davidlai, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-01 12:42:35] asavchuk: maybe using specific ie.Proxy ?
[2013-08-01 12:42:58] asavchuk: and marking current as deprecated?
[2013-08-01 12:43:29] jimevans: asavchuk: well you can't do that. "proxy" is a global capability, used by all drivers
[2013-08-01 12:44:00] nirvdrum: asavchuk: RWD should notice that the experimental proxy capability is present and just not screw with the proxy registry settings in that case.
[2013-08-01 12:44:22] barancev: re: deployment -- what do you think about https://bintray.com/ ?
[2013-08-01 12:46:35] jimevans: nirvdrum, asavchuk: so the issues you're talking about are exclusive to the java bindings (which, of course, is complicated, because everyone uses them if they're using grid/remote). i haven't started looking into the java code to see how hard/easy it would be to account for IE being able to set its own proxy settings now.
[2013-08-01 12:47:06] nirvdrum: jimevans: Not exclusive to Java bindings.  I use the Ruby bindings.  But RWD is only implemented in Java.
[2013-08-01 12:47:18] nirvdrum: Selenium Server will do that proxy stuff I'm talking about.
[2013-08-01 12:47:40] jimevans: right. what i said. everyone uses java bindings if they're using grid or remote.
[2013-08-01 12:47:51] nirvdrum: Accounting for this should actually be pretty straightforward.  I can take a look at it.  But if you're looking to get a release out this week, I'm probably not the guy.
[2013-08-01 12:47:54] jimevans: (because on the remote end, it's java)
[2013-08-01 12:48:12] nirvdrum: That's fine.  I just wanted to clarify that it's not really the client bindings.
[2013-08-01 12:48:16] asavchuk: jimevans: that's why i suggest experimental "ie.Proxy" capability - it will not break "proxy". so we just need to change "proxy" to "ie.Proxy" at iedriver
[2013-08-01 12:49:00] nirvdrum: asavchuk: You can already look at the "ie.usePerProcessProxy" capability.  If it's set, then don't configure the proxy the old way.
[2013-08-01 12:49:14] jimevans: nirvdrum: but that's not enough.
[2013-08-01 12:49:21] nirvdrum: jimevans: Why not?
[2013-08-01 12:49:36] jimevans: one *could* pass a proxy capability, without specifying ie.usePerProcessProxy at all
[2013-08-01 12:49:51] jimevans: and to the IE driver, that means "set the system proxy"
[2013-08-01 12:49:51] nirvdrum: jimevans: Right.  And I'm saying that should continue to work the way it does today.
[2013-08-01 12:49:56] nirvdrum: Oh.
[2013-08-01 12:50:03] nirvdrum: Well, that's something else :-P
[2013-08-01 12:50:17] nirvdrum: So, IEDriverServer ignores "ie.usePerProcessProxy" ?
[2013-08-01 12:50:26] jimevans: no, it definitely uses it.
[2013-08-01 12:51:04] asavchuk: as i understand, right now if "proxy" is set both java and IEdriver code will try to set system proxy
[2013-08-01 12:51:05] nirvdrum: So shouldn't it ignore "proxy" unless "ie.usePerProcessProxy" is set?  Or does IEDriverServer now handle global proxy config?
[2013-08-01 12:51:06] jimevans: but since i'm using a total hack to get it to work, with nothing but my own intuition, trial and error, and good luck, i don't want to make it the default;.
[2013-08-01 12:51:19] ianbrandt, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-08-01 12:51:36] jimevans: IEDriverServer is supposed to handle global proxy config (for the case where the IE driver is used)
[2013-08-01 12:51:37] nirvdrum: Maybe I'm missing something.  Today, the IEDriver ignores "proxy" right?
[2013-08-01 12:51:45] ianbrandt, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-01 12:51:51] nirvdrum: (Today == latest release)
[2013-08-01 12:52:29] seljenkinsbot: Project IE 9 Java Tests build #2739: UNSTABLE in 12 min: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/IE%209%20Java%20Tests/2739/
[2013-08-01 12:52:37] jimevans: as of latest checked-in binaries, it does *not* ignore the proxy capability. "latest public release" and "latest checked-in prebuilt binary" are two different things.
[2013-08-01 12:52:52] nirvdrum: Which is why I just clarified.
[2013-08-01 12:53:10] nirvdrum: "Latest checked-in prebuilt binary" is something that can be easily changed without breaking things.
[2013-08-01 12:53:19] jimevans: latest public release doesn't handle the proxy capability, no.
[2013-08-01 12:53:38] nirvdrum: So, the new stuff only handles per-process proxy, right?
[2013-08-01 12:53:54] nirvdrum: Or did you add two proxy implementations?
[2013-08-01 12:54:02] daemon: hey all I am trying to write an automated test on a site, but when I click login it pops up a javascript powered Iframe where you are meant to enter your login details

[2013-08-01 12:54:28] jimevans: no, latest checked-in prebuilt binary understands the "proxy" capability. if ie.usePerProcessProxy is false or not set, set the system proxy.
[2013-08-01 12:54:41] brettporter, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-01 12:54:45] nirvdrum: So that screws with the registry then?
[2013-08-01 12:55:20] jimevans: indirectly, yes. it uses the approved InternetSetOption API, rather than direct registry hacks.
[2013-08-01 12:55:35] nirvdrum: That's fine.  It'll ultimately update the registry though.
[2013-08-01 12:55:43] nirvdrum: In that case, we can just remove the Java stuff completely I think.
[2013-08-01 12:55:55] nirvdrum: Obviously the new bindings won't work with an old IE driver.
[2013-08-01 12:56:30] nirvdrum: Old bindings with a new IE driver would probably get screwed up during the clean up, but would function otherwise.
[2013-08-01 12:57:05] jimevans: probably, yes. although maybe not.
[2013-08-01 12:58:33] nirvdrum: Well, either the Java stuff runs first and modifies the registry, in which case your API call would overwrite the values.
[2013-08-01 12:58:44] nirvdrum: Or your stuff would run first, in which case the registry would be overwritten.
[2013-08-01 12:59:02] nirvdrum: If the former, the cleanup should actually still work.  If the latter, it wouldn't.
[2013-08-01 12:59:04] jimevans: nirvdrum: but both would write their values back on exit.
[2013-08-01 12:59:15] jimevans: s/their values/their saved values/
[2013-08-01 12:59:30] jimevans: so as long as the registry changes are nested, you're good.
[2013-08-01 12:59:36] yairgo, quitting. (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[2013-08-01 12:59:51] nirvdrum: I think they are.  The registry needs to be written to before IE starts up.
[2013-08-01 13:00:03] dimacus, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-08-01 13:00:07] nirvdrum: And I'm almost positive it cleans up the registry after IE is shut down.
[2013-08-01 13:00:12] jimevans: java language bindings modify -> IEDriverServer modifies -> IEDriverServer restores it's saved -> java bindings restore its saved settings
[2013-08-01 13:00:24] nirvdrum: Right.  I think that's the order.
[2013-08-01 13:00:38] nirvdrum: And if you run multi-IE, all bets are off anyway.
[2013-08-01 13:00:41] nirvdrum: Gotta jet.  Meeting time.
[2013-08-01 13:01:26] nirvdrum: The real problem would be using a newer java binding without the registry mod, but talking to an old IE Server that doesn't do anything with "proxy"
[2013-08-01 13:01:41] nirvdrum: In that one situation, tests that previously passed would fail because nothing is setting the proxy.
[2013-08-01 13:01:41] jimevans: yep. that would be a problem.

[2013-08-01 13:03:05] jimevans: and to think, all this came out of a desire to write the definitive "use a damned proxy for http status codes" blog post for the .NET bindings.

[2013-08-01 13:31:22] jarib: barancev: not sure what is better, tbh.. i don't know if anyone else relies on the capability

[2013-08-01 13:35:23] WillPittenger: He says he did that.
[2013-08-01 13:35:46] barancev: so your claim "it did't help" is wrong because he did not :)
[2013-08-01 13:36:01] barancev: jarib: ok, let's change the server
[2013-08-01 13:36:16] WillPittenger: He just stated he thinks the classpath variable isn't taking.  It works when he puts the classpath on the command line.

[2013-08-01 13:37:00] barancev: I personally never use classpath variable, may be it just wrong to use it
[2013-08-01 13:37:02] WillPittenger: He seems to be using a Windows netbook.
[2013-08-01 13:37:24] barancev: nevertheless, I can't see selenium-server-standalone-2.33.jar in this variable, anyway
[2013-08-01 13:37:38] WillPittenger: He says it's compiling now.

[2013-08-01 18:14:51] WillPittenger: How do I test for text being on a page?  The text in question isn't part of a link.
[2013-08-01 18:15:40] sibichakravarthy: how do i insert a variable in the 'find_element_by_css_selector' ?
[2013-08-01 18:16:21] WillPittenger: sibichakravarthy: A variable?  You mean you want to dynamically change the selector?  Build a string and pass that.
[2013-08-01 18:16:43] sibichakravarthy: i tried..let me show u the code
[2013-08-01 18:17:09] sibichakravarthy: h = By.cssSelector('%s a[name="product"]'%menu_item)
[2013-08-01 18:17:12] sibichakravarthy: is this right?
[2013-08-01 18:17:40] WillPittenger: Which language is that?  I only know C#, C++, and Java.
[2013-08-01 18:17:45] sibichakravarthy: python?
[2013-08-01 18:18:00] WillPittenger: Ask someone else then.

[2013-08-01 18:58:50] varialus: Is there a standard location that the various selenium language bindings store webdriver binaries and log files? I'm working on some new binding and I'm currently planning on storing them in the user's home directory at ~/.selenium

[2013-08-01 19:10:03] daemon: varialus, doubtful due to the amount of base operating systems selenium is rolled out upon
[2013-08-01 19:10:28] daemon: its probably OS specific based on what is most desirable for that enviroment
[2013-08-01 19:13:08] varialus: daemon: Thanks. I'd like my bindings to not require root privileges nor installation, so I'm just going to stick with ~/.selenium for now.
[2013-08-01 19:13:30] varialus: Once it's further along, I can show it off to get more feedback.
[2013-08-01 19:14:12] daemon: :-)
