[2013-08-30 06:56:53] Ahmed_: ddary when will this be available?

[2013-08-30 07:25:23] jimevans: okay
[2013-08-30 07:25:35] jimevans: so here's my dilemma
[2013-08-30 07:26:30] jimevans: findElement(By.linkText('foo')), where an <a> element matching that text exists, but exists in a div with overflow:hidden, and appears outside the overflow area of the div.
[2013-08-30 07:26:39] jimevans: should the element be found?
[2013-08-30 07:27:13] jimevans: AutomatedTester, gdennis: feel free to weigh in.

[2013-08-30 07:28:39] jimevans: kkania: you too.
[2013-08-30 07:29:25] AutomatedTester: jimevans: so it cant be seen because of the overflow?
[2013-08-30 07:29:38] jimevans: the <a> element can't be, no.
[2013-08-30 07:29:46] AutomatedTester: then its not visible
[2013-08-30 07:29:51] jimevans: note, i'm not trying to do anything other than find it.
[2013-08-30 07:29:57] gdennis: it should be found, I think
[2013-08-30 07:30:03] AutomatedTester: it should be found
[2013-08-30 07:30:06] jimevans: it won't be.
[2013-08-30 07:30:09] oliveiraev, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-30 07:30:13] AutomatedTester: if its in the DOM it should be found
[2013-08-30 07:30:23] jimevans: at least not with the current state of the atoms code.
[2013-08-30 07:30:27] AutomatedTester: ?
[2013-08-30 07:30:40] barancev: AutomatedTester: it should not be found :)
[2013-08-30 07:30:52] barancev: because its text is empty string
[2013-08-30 07:30:56] AutomatedTester: ooooo
[2013-08-30 07:30:57] jimevans: bot.dom.getVisibleText will return no text. find by link text depends on getVisibleText
[2013-08-30 07:31:08] AutomatedTester: sorry I never saw by link text
[2013-08-30 07:31:09] mansi, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2013-08-30 07:31:19] AutomatedTester: yea, its not visible
[2013-08-30 07:31:25] AutomatedTester: you need to find it via xpath etc
[2013-08-30 07:31:38] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-30 07:31:38] barancev: yes. I'd kill this location strategy
[2013-08-30 07:32:03] AutomatedTester: jimevans: you arent looking for a specific DOM node, just if one matches some text
[2013-08-30 07:32:15] AutomatedTester: since the text isnt visible it shouldnt be found
[2013-08-30 07:32:23] jimevans: bah. that answer sucks for me. i totally get it, and i won't argue about it, but the answer sucks for me.
[2013-08-30 07:32:34] gdennis: well, so what's the specification of By.linkText?
[2013-08-30 07:33:19] jimevans: AutomatedTester: note for the spec for finding by [partial] link text.
[2013-08-30 07:34:12] gdennis: looks like the specification is ambiguous: "locates A elements that contain the given link text"
[2013-08-30 07:34:35] gdennis: it's not clear whether it matches visible text or just text that happens to be in the DOM
[2013-08-30 07:35:16] AutomatedTester: since link text is a fluffy locator imho it should abide by text visibility
[2013-08-30 07:35:38] tourdedave, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-30 07:35:53] AutomatedTester: its a "do what I mean" instead of do what I say (to channel simonstewart)
[2013-08-30 07:36:10] gdennis: that's a good argument
[2013-08-30 07:36:25] AutomatedTester: jimevans or gdennis mind raising a bug on the spec for that please
[2013-08-30 07:36:29] barancev: btw, what if there is an element <span>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa<span>bbbbb</span></span> in an overflow block, and the second (inner) span is not in the visible area -- what should be the text of this element?
[2013-08-30 07:36:57] AutomatedTester: aaaaaaaaaaa
[2013-08-30 07:37:09] gdennis: the counter-argument, I think, is that the locators should always be a free of visibility analysis
[2013-08-30 07:37:31] barancev: yes. and if it is a link, not a span, I should search it by this text 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'
[2013-08-30 07:37:34] gdennis: we don't place the same requirement on finding by id, name, or anything else
[2013-08-30 07:37:50] selim, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-30 07:38:04] AutomatedTester: gdennis: since id/class/css/xpath are asking for specific DOM nodes
[2013-08-30 07:38:06] barancev: gdennis: what if you have a link that contains a hiden span with a hidden text?
[2013-08-30 07:38:22] gdennis: I also don't like the circular dependency it creates
[2013-08-30 07:38:26] barancev: would you like it to be found by "full" text or visible?
[2013-08-30 07:38:38] gdennis: because a visibility analysis may need to find elements in the DOM
[2013-08-30 07:38:49] gdennis: and now finding elements in the DOM may need a visibility analysis
[2013-08-30 07:38:58] AutomatedTester: (partial) Link Text is asking you to scan the DOM for text that makes that equal and we already normalise the text
[2013-08-30 07:39:32] AutomatedTester: so do we stop normalising the text and have it like Selenium RC?
[2013-08-30 07:39:42] *AutomatedTester goes to get a can of worms quickly'
[2013-08-30 07:39:49] gdennis: it's a good question: where to draw the line

[2013-08-30 07:40:39] Selenium-Git, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-08-30 07:40:40] gdennis: My instinct is that finding elements is a textual/syntactic thing, just not a visibility thing
[2013-08-30 07:41:05] gdennis: and so text normalization is fine
[2013-08-30 07:41:23] AutomatedTester: I say, if you can express it by asking for an attribute on a DOM node (like you do for id/class/css/xpath) then it is "Do what I say" and when its (partial) Link Text it finds what it can
[2013-08-30 07:41:33] AutomatedTester: based on visible text
[2013-08-30 07:41:57] jimevans: the other alternative is to simply make link text alias By.xpath("//a[text()='foo']")
[2013-08-30 07:42:13] AutomatedTester: jimevans: and that goes back to "do what I say"

[2013-08-30 07:42:44] jimevans: i'm not sure i have a strong opinion either way.
[2013-08-30 07:42:49] gdennis: I think "do what I say" is good for locators, because location is something you want to be precise/exact
[2013-08-30 07:43:08] jimevans: just pointing out an option that would keep semantics that until recently worked just fine.
[2013-08-30 07:43:11] gdennis: and all other locators are precise
[2013-08-30 07:43:48] barancev: that's why I'd kill By.linkText :)
[2013-08-30 07:43:49] gdennis: and making the location dependent on the visibility algorithm introduces fragility and that circular dependency
[2013-08-30 07:44:22] gdennis: yeah, so maybe it never should have existed :)
[2013-08-30 07:44:35] AutomatedTester: if you have <div><a hidden id='foo1' href='x'>foo'</a><a href='#' id='foo2'>foo</a></div> which would you want returned from driver.findElement(By.LinkText('foo'));
[2013-08-30 07:44:57] AutomatedTester: the user would expect the 2nd
[2013-08-30 07:44:58] gdennis: whatever happens when both are not hidden
[2013-08-30 07:46:17] gdennis: in the tool I work on, if you do the equivalent of "findElement" with a locator that matches multiple, that's an error
[2013-08-30 07:47:11] gdennis: so I have a bit of a bias there :)
[2013-08-30 07:47:13] AutomatedTester: so now do we apply the same logic to everything?
[2013-08-30 07:47:36] AutomatedTester: findElement(By.XPATH('//a'))
[2013-08-30 07:47:44] AutomatedTester: that errors in on your tool?
[2013-08-30 07:47:53] gdennis: if there are multiple links, yes
[2013-08-30 07:47:58] gdennis: because it's ambiguous
[2013-08-30 07:48:01] Dude-X__, changing nick to Dude-X.
[2013-08-30 07:48:11] gdennis: if the user wants the first link, I make them be explicit about that
[2013-08-30 07:48:37] AutomatedTester: that goes against how we have done things
[2013-08-30 07:48:41] gdennis: then can qualify the xpath to choose the first, or they can do "findElements" (plural) and get the first
[2013-08-30 07:49:20] AutomatedTester: I can see the reasoning but there will be a lot of upset users
[2013-08-30 07:49:39] gdennis: yeah, I know, not realistic to do

[2013-08-30 07:50:58] AutomatedTester: "using strict";
[2013-08-30 07:51:49] gdennis: anyway, my vote is for discouraging "by link text" to begin with, but not making it dependent on any visibility properties, just syntactic ones
[2013-08-30 07:52:55] AutomatedTester: gdennis: jimevans post to the dev list
[2013-08-30 07:53:03] AutomatedTester: looks like we need further debate with more people
[2013-08-30 07:53:41] jimevans: visibility is hard, let's go shopping!

[2013-08-30 07:56:50] Ardesco: deprecate byLinkText and remove it in Se3
[2013-08-30 07:57:10] AutomatedTester: I am happy to do that too
[2013-08-30 07:57:20] Ardesco: you can do byLinkText with and Xoath anyway
[2013-08-30 07:57:24] Ardesco: an XPath
[2013-08-30 07:57:34] AutomatedTester: but I want more thoughts on this
[2013-08-30 07:57:41] AutomatedTester: hence putting it to the mailing list
[2013-08-30 07:57:50] Ardesco: NO, just KILL IT!

[2013-08-30 07:58:27] nirvdrum: As do I.
[2013-08-30 07:58:33] Ardesco: what can you do with byLinkText that you can't do with the other available locators?
[2013-08-30 07:58:46] nirvdrum: It's clearer?
[2013-08-30 07:59:06] nirvdrum: What can you do with CSS selectors that you can't do with XPath?

[2013-08-30 07:59:53] Ardesco: you don't need to jump through the cpntians(@class, 'foo') hoop
[2013-08-30 07:59:54] barancev: 2) //*[@id='x']/..
[2013-08-30 07:59:58] nirvdrum: byLinkText is cleaner than xpath.
[2013-08-30 08:00:13] *AutomatedTester gets his broken record and says "put it to the mailing list"'
[2013-08-30 08:00:16] Ardesco: dammit i just blew my own argument out of the water
[2013-08-30 08:00:17] Ardesco: :)
[2013-08-30 08:00:21] nirvdrum: Heh.
[2013-08-30 08:00:36] nirvdrum: Obviously there's a line that needs to be drawn somewhere.
[2013-08-30 08:00:47] Ardesco: being more serious though the others are all specifically looking for elements
[2013-08-30 08:00:54] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Much harder to argue in real time on the list :-)
[2013-08-30 08:01:02] Ardesco: by link text seems to be scanning the page looking for text and hoping
[2013-08-30 08:01:16] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: forces people to think about what they are saying
[2013-08-30 08:01:24] jimevans: Ardesco: sort of.
[2013-08-30 08:01:33] Ardesco: I guess it comes down to the fact I generally don't like the vast majority of locators I have seen that look for link text
[2013-08-30 08:01:33] mansi, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2013-08-30 08:01:51] Ardesco: or just text in general
[2013-08-30 08:01:57] Ardesco: it harkens back to the bad old days of rc
[2013-08-30 08:02:00] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I think you have a discussion topic for the next hangout.
[2013-08-30 08:02:01] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-30 08:02:09] Ardesco: where people would assert text was on a page and say the test had passed
[2013-08-30 08:02:11] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I have a number :)
[2013-08-30 08:02:19] mansi, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2013-08-30 08:02:23] nirvdrum: Ardesco: The subtle implication there is RC got everything wrong, which I don't find to be accurate.
[2013-08-30 08:02:30] jimevans: by link text actually says, "give me all of the <a> elements on the page, and match their [visible] text with what i'm specifying." visible in brackets because that's the ambiguous part.
[2013-08-30 08:02:38] Ardesco: I still see implementations where people go a get page source and scan it for text to pass a test
[2013-08-30 08:02:40] *Ardesco shudders'
[2013-08-30 08:02:45] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-30 08:02:57] jimevans: nirvdrum: RC *did* get everything wrong!
[2013-08-30 08:02:59] Ardesco: RC didn't get everything wrong
[2013-08-30 08:03:02] *jimevans ducks'
[2013-08-30 08:03:17] Ardesco: but it made it very simple to do stupid things that were wrong
[2013-08-30 08:03:38] Ardesco: i.e. scanning the whole page for the text login to see if a login button was there
[2013-08-30 08:03:54] Ardesco: because people didn't know how to do it properly and doing it badly was way too easy
[2013-08-30 08:04:25] barancev: gdennis: back to the real issues. why do you think we should not add BrowserSpecificOffset to a LocationRelativeToWindowHandle?
[2013-08-30 08:04:26] Ardesco: I like the fact that WebDriver forces you to find an element to do stuff
[2013-08-30 08:04:38] Ardesco: it forces you to have some level of understanding about how the page is built
[2013-08-30 08:04:46] cnd, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-08-30 08:05:37] barancev: to perform a native click we need "screen-related" coordinates

[2013-08-30 08:05:39] nirvdrum: Ardesco: Or forces N different byLinkText implementations :-P
[2013-08-30 08:05:52] barancev: we can even move mouse of of the browser window
[2013-08-30 08:06:14] Ardesco: I would love to see a command in WebDriver to move the cursor off the browser window
[2013-08-30 08:06:28] Ardesco: to prevent accidental hover events
[2013-08-30 08:06:59] barancev: Ardesco: no, not the real cursor :)

[2013-08-30 08:11:19] nirvdrum: Well, it shouldn't be singular.
[2013-08-30 08:11:29] nirvdrum: But the DOM itself finds that a useful enough method to provide.

[2013-08-30 08:12:29] Ardesco: I think that would be a bad idea because people would start using co-ordinates all over the place
[2013-08-30 08:12:36] Ardesco: they can still do it with a JavaScript executor
[2013-08-30 08:12:50] Ardesco: but to do it they need to have some knowledge right now
[2013-08-30 08:13:06] barancev: instead, we could redesign By to allow extending it
[2013-08-30 08:13:27] Ardesco: well that would be a good thing to do anyway
[2013-08-30 08:13:51] sburjan, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-08-30 08:13:51] nirvdrum: All I'm suggesting is roughly the same thing I said in the hangout.  There are extremely common patterns of Selenium usage and it probably makes sense to have a less terse API for them.
[2013-08-30 08:13:54] Ardesco: any plans for a byImage in the WebDriver spec
[2013-08-30 08:13:57] jimevans: barancev: how is it not extensible now?
[2013-08-30 08:13:58] nirvdrum: But maybe that doesn't make sense in Selenium itself.
[2013-08-30 08:14:14] nirvdrum: capybara seems rather popular for much this reason.
[2013-08-30 08:14:27] barancev: jimevans: it is impossible to add new methods to By class
[2013-08-30 08:14:34] Ardesco: *sigh* robot to install things time
[2013-08-30 08:14:38] Ardesco, quitting. (Quit: Ardesco)
[2013-08-30 08:14:59] barancev: so the pattern of use of By class (static methods) is an obstacle for extending
[2013-08-30 08:15:00] jimevans: barancev: but it's perfectly possible to subclass By, and use that for findElement, no?

[2013-08-30 08:16:17] barancev: yes, it is possible, may be we just have to document it properly
[2013-08-30 08:16:18] gdennis: thought it makes that test pass
[2013-08-30 08:16:28] barancev: but I find it hard to extend this way

[2013-08-30 08:16:49] barancev: gdennis: "it makes a bunch of other tests fail to remove it" <<---- true :)
[2013-08-30 08:17:09] gdennis: barancev: I saw it made the failing test pass, and it looked like Utils.getLocationRelativeToWindowHandle already took the offset into account
[2013-08-30 08:17:35] barancev: no, it returns "window-relative" offset
[2013-08-30 08:17:50] barancev: but native click wants "screen-relative" one

[2013-08-30 09:18:29] jleyba: or do we have to go through desired capabilities
[2013-08-30 09:18:42] jimevans: jleyba: i have no idea about the standalone server.

[2013-08-30 10:21:34] Ahmed_: i mean no error messages
[2013-08-30 10:21:48] Ahmed_: and nothing in the logcat because it didn't arrive there
[2013-08-30 10:22:58] Ahmed_: this is the exception i get : https://gist.github.com/AhmedIbrahiim/3feb1677d7ac2aa4466d
[2013-08-30 10:23:18] lukeis: so the jar console doesn't show a connection coming?

[2013-08-30 10:30:22] lukeis: default port without specifying anything to selendroid is 5555
[2013-08-30 10:31:31] Ahmed_: so the problem was the port!
[2013-08-30 10:31:41] Ahmed_: changing the port to 4444 did the job
[2013-08-30 10:31:48] lukeis: cool :)
[2013-08-30 10:32:01] Ahmed_: maybe there's something running in this port!
[2013-08-30 10:32:39] lukeis: should work on any port not blocked on your box...
[2013-08-30 10:32:47] Ahmed_: but no the same code was running with the same port when i removed the -installedApp

[2013-08-30 12:31:52] andreastt: Me too.  £25k in my case.  On the upside it's a cheap loan, and I'll be debt-free when I'm 41 years old! \o/
[2013-08-30 12:31:57] lukeis: cheapest for a year, if you live with family is $24k
[2013-08-30 12:32:06] jleyba: lukeis: UC is actually on par with a private school
[2013-08-30 12:32:18] AutomatedTester: thats crazy money
[2013-08-30 12:32:25] jleyba: but that doesn't change the fact that a public school should never charge what a private school does...
[2013-08-30 12:32:43] andreastt: Right.  We don't have the concept of private schools.
[2013-08-30 12:32:46] lukeis: i dunno, standford, usc, pepperdine… are a lot more money
[2013-08-30 12:32:57] lukeis: $45k min for those
[2013-08-30 12:33:10] jleyba: i was looking at the out of state

[2013-08-30 12:34:16] jleyba: my first year of undergrad was only 12k..  it was up to 17k by the time i finished

[2013-08-30 12:51:51] Dude-X_: probably one of the few times the government did something in response to a citizen's petition
[2013-08-30 12:52:51] Dude-X_: but there was some dubious motives to prohibition; they thought by banning alcohol they could stop minorities and poor from abusing alcohol; the rich can still get alcohol freely.
[2013-08-30 12:53:43] cgoldberg: don't catholics read the bible? (where they drink wine every other sentence) ... odd group to lobby for prohibition
