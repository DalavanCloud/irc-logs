[2013-08-07 06:32:53] Dave_B_: jawr: can't you just open the page in your browser and inspect the html?

[2013-08-07 06:33:41] jawr: i am doing Dave_B_ that's how i came up with the initial selector
[2013-08-07 06:33:42] p_l: Dave_B_: I use it in place of selectors sometimes
[2013-08-07 06:33:50] jawr: also, the selector works in jquery on the console
[2013-08-07 06:34:27] jawr: p_l: how do you retrieve the element? give it a unique id then retrieve it afterwards?
[2013-08-07 06:34:51] p_l: jawr: no, $(selector)[index of the element in jquery results]
[2013-08-07 06:35:22] p_l: for safety, I drill down to one element in jquery then use .get(0) or [0] on it
[2013-08-07 06:35:59] p_l: this gets returned as WebElement on Java side

[2013-08-07 06:36:24] jawr: oh, that's pretty niffty
[2013-08-07 06:36:37] jawr: that it parses the return of the jquery to an element
[2013-08-07 06:36:56] p_l: actually, it parses if you return a bare DOM element back
[2013-08-07 06:37:10] p_l: [0] recovers the DOM node from jQuery
[2013-08-07 06:37:26] jawr: let's give it a go
[2013-08-07 06:37:36] p_l: same way you can pass WebElement as argument to JS execution from java

[2013-08-07 07:18:12] Moses_: i set the timeout to 20 s and  after 5 min it's most likeky still there
[2013-08-07 07:18:13] asavchuk: Moses_: selenium version? configuration of node and hub ?
[2013-08-07 07:18:31] asavchuk: timeout is not for that.
[2013-08-07 07:18:38] Moses_: oh ok
[2013-08-07 07:18:41] asavchuk: if you said about -timeout parameter
[2013-08-07 07:19:02] Moses_: 2.31 hub and node are almost completely default

[2013-08-07 07:19:43] Moses_: yes i was talking of the timout param
[2013-08-07 07:20:01] Moses_: so there is no way to deregister nodes manually?
[2013-08-07 07:20:13] asavchuk: ok. for dead node you mean Selenium java process is killed or node totally is not available ?
[2013-08-07 07:21:00] Moses_: in this case even the vm where the node was runing is killed
[2013-08-07 07:21:02] asavchuk: i'm not sure there is.
[2013-08-07 07:21:15] plightbo_work, quitting. (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[2013-08-07 07:21:50] Moses_: it would also be an option to close the node properly, but at least after sighup it also does not unregister itself
[2013-08-07 07:21:59] Dave_B_: I'd assume nodePolling tells it how often to check a node is available? On defaults i see nodes become 'cannot be reached at the moment' pretty quickly and are then removed shortly trhereafter

[2013-08-07 07:29:26] Moses_: Dave_B_: i think i did not understand your question. The vm with the node is killed. the hub does not recognize this. the next test which is sent to the hub will be given to the first node matching capabilities. thus a exception is thrown which says "host unreachable"
[2013-08-07 07:30:24] asavchuk: Moses_: but be note that it _may_ not help in case of dead node/vm. i'd recommend to update to last selenium 2.34 and use all avaialbale paramters: nodePolling unregisterIfStillDownAfter  downPollingLimit  nodeStatusCheckTimeout
[2013-08-07 07:31:37] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-07 07:31:41] Moses_: ok, so that implies that these params are not available in 2.31?
[2013-08-07 07:31:55] Moses_: or do you recommend the update for some other reason?
[2013-08-07 07:32:21] asavchuk: these 2 are available only in >= 2.34 : downPollingLimit nodeStatusCheckTimeout
[2013-08-07 07:32:47] asavchuk: but please try w/o update - maybe all will work :)

[2013-08-07 07:39:56] Moses_: 1000 doesn't seam to be positive enough.. :/

[2013-08-07 07:46:39] asavchuk: it works stable at our internal network and dead vm nodes are excluded in some seconds.

[2013-08-07 08:20:54] leo-the-manic: Hi all, I wanted to write a Selenium test to check that my webapp doesn't stay logged in if you close the window. But it seems each WebDriver instance has its own session info. Is there a way I can close and open a new window, while maintaining session data etc. in the manner a normal desktop user would?
[2013-08-07 08:21:00] leo-the-manic: I'm using Python if that makes a difference
[2013-08-07 08:22:02] AutomatedTester: leo-the-manic: no, when the last window closes we go into clean up mode and start releasing resources
[2013-08-07 08:22:28] AutomatedTester: leo-the-manic: you could always delete the cookie or use JS and clean up the session storage

Right now I haven't fixed that issue but I can't reproduce it in Selenium because it seems like each Selenium window has its own independent session info
[2013-08-07 08:25:40] AutomatedTester: ok, you cant do what you want in Selenium
[2013-08-07 08:26:25] Dave_B_: maybe you could open a main window, open a second one, do what you want, close it, keeping main window alive, then open a third and do second half of the check? Not sure it'd work
[2013-08-07 08:26:51] Dave_B_: as in open them from the main window so they're not separate driver instances

[2013-08-07 12:54:01] smccarthy: Androidnewbe: is the element in an iframe ?

[2013-08-07 12:55:15] Androidnewbe: what do you mean by locator ?
[2013-08-07 12:55:37] jimevans: an xpath that finds the element.
[2013-08-07 12:55:49] jimevans: because some xpaths are more brittle than others.
[2013-08-07 12:56:00] smccarthy: yea, so what is the string of the xpath you are using ?
[2013-08-07 12:56:21] Androidnewbe: hmmm but it is werid becasue for rexample out of 140 same pages it will fail on like 5
[2013-08-07 12:56:54] jimevans: Androidnewbe: that sounds very much like a synchronization problem.
