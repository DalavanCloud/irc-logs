[2013-08-06 02:27:50] simonstewart: We'll pull in marionette driver as a third-party library
[2013-08-06 02:28:14] barancev: I see your point, you're absolutely right
[2013-08-06 02:29:08] barancev: on the other hand... why not move FirefoxDriver to mozilla manespace too?
[2013-08-06 02:29:19] barancev: *namespace
[2013-08-06 02:29:42] barancev: (other than they don't want to support it :))
[2013-08-06 02:29:42] simonstewart: At some point we'll delete the existing FirefoxDriver
[2013-08-06 02:30:01] simonstewart: The spec mandates that the implementations support the json wire protocol
[2013-08-06 02:30:21] simonstewart: So we'll end up hollowing it out to be a service for starting their shim (or perhaps the browser itself)
[2013-08-06 02:30:37] simonstewart: and then using a normal remote webdriver with a lot less special-cased logic
[2013-08-06 02:30:44] simonstewart: It'll look a lot like the chromedriver
[2013-08-06 02:30:54] barancev: I'd start with extracting all drivers to separate subprojects
[2013-08-06 02:31:12] simonstewart: I think there's a balance to be struck
[2013-08-06 02:31:21] simonstewart: The chromedriver is a really nice model
[2013-08-06 02:31:45] simonstewart: The selenium project provides a nice wrapper around the chrome team's work
[2013-08-06 02:31:54] simonstewart: but really, we don't have a lot of special-cased logic
[2013-08-06 02:32:12] barancev: the same is true for IE driver
[2013-08-06 02:32:15] simonstewart: It's "just" a simple extension of the remote webdriver and a mechanism for starting the shim
[2013-08-06 02:32:16] simonstewart: Yeah
[2013-08-06 02:32:26] barancev: excepto for the fact that it is in the same code tree
[2013-08-06 02:32:38] simonstewart: I don't mind us owning code that wraps theirs
[2013-08-06 02:32:58] simonstewart: But I think that the marionette specific communication channel is a little too far
[2013-08-06 02:33:02] simonstewart: That's mozilla-specific
[2013-08-06 02:33:55] barancev: I disagree with the "protocol" part
[2013-08-06 02:34:06] barancev: there is app level and transport level
[2013-08-06 02:34:17] barancev: app level should be specified in the spec
[2013-08-06 02:34:28] simonstewart: The spec defines the json wire protocol
[2013-08-06 02:34:32] simonstewart: (will define)
[2013-08-06 02:34:41] barancev: transport can be different -- http or websockets

[2013-08-06 06:25:07] andreastt: Depending on the UI toolkit used there might exist automation solutions.
[2013-08-06 06:25:22] barancev: but a java applet can be loaded in the applet viewer that is a java app
[2013-08-06 06:25:43] barancev: and you can manage it with any java automation framework

[2013-08-06 08:25:11] Androidnewbe: hi i just wondered abotu urnning multiple instances of a webdriver for testing but would this really speed things up ? or the processor would just round robin all the instance and it would work out the same as running one but much quicker ?
[2013-08-06 08:25:12] phasze: tried to copy your KillAllByName thing
[2013-08-06 08:25:27] phasze: Abtin: state your question
[2013-08-06 08:26:16] phasze: Androidnewbe: multiple instances of webdriver or just turning up maxsessions in grid2?
[2013-08-06 08:26:24] Abtin: I've described it here, would be much appreciated if you can take a look. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18082680/selenium-webdriver-with-php-returns-element0-on-all-element-findings
[2013-08-06 08:26:38] Androidnewbe: phasze: i just mean testing on local machine
[2013-08-06 08:26:53] dimacus: phasze:  KillAllByName might not be the best one
[2013-08-06 08:26:59] Androidnewbe: but  i think you can open multiple browsers rigth ?
[2013-08-06 08:27:09] phasze: dimacus: is your killallbyname not working? :P
[2013-08-06 08:27:13] Androidnewbe: i can't remember how it worked
[2013-08-06 08:27:41] phasze: Androidnewbe: you might be able to if you define multiple drivers
[2013-08-06 08:27:44] Dave_B_: Androidnewbe: I run multiple browsers at the same time, its much faster than all waiting for the same one
[2013-08-06 08:28:26] dimacus: phasze:  itry ExposeDirectory.java there is a cleanUpExposedDirectory method
[2013-08-06 08:28:30] Androidnewbe: but why is it faster if processor spends more time trying to serv each of them
[2013-08-06 08:28:41] Dave_B_: erm
[2013-08-06 08:28:52] Dave_B_: 1. processors can have more than 1 core
[2013-08-06 08:29:05] Dave_B_: 2. if waiting on a page to load we're not using the processor much anyway
[2013-08-06 08:29:25] Dave_B_: 3. scales much better across lots of machines
[2013-08-06 08:29:28] Dave_B_: etc
[2013-08-06 08:29:52] Dave_B_: yes, if you try to reun 100 webdriver instances on 1 machine you'll not get much from it

[2013-08-06 08:35:46] lukeis: Abtin: well, something's wrong somewhere with the php code, cause it works fine in python :)  https://gist.github.com/lukeis/6165591
[2013-08-06 08:35:50] Dave_B_: if testing with one browser plus your web server is maxcing your machine i'd not wrry about simultaneous instances :)

[2013-08-06 08:40:10] Gwildor: last question, i am automating http firewall maintenance, is the selenium "testing tool" the proper toolset? or is it jsut not built for it ?
[2013-08-06 08:40:12] simonstewart: 'sup?
[2013-08-06 08:40:27] jimevans: ohai simonstewart!
[2013-08-06 08:40:36] jimevans: kkania was wondering about the shadow dom.
[2013-08-06 08:40:42] simonstewart: Yes
[2013-08-06 08:40:45] jimevans: one of your favorite topics, i know.
[2013-08-06 08:41:03] Dude-X: Gwildor: if the firewall ui relies on javascript and stuff, then selenium will be good, otherwise if you can do gets/posts then you can use an HTTP client library
[2013-08-06 08:41:06] kkania: simonstewart: i've some users who are complaining the switch to subtree command for shadow dom is a pain for nested shadow trees
[2013-08-06 08:41:24] simonstewart: Can't remember whether we decided to use a "switchTo" or a role-based interface
[2013-08-06 08:41:28] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-06 08:41:30] Gwildor: Dude-X_: javascript, iframes, pop-ups....
[2013-08-06 08:41:37] simonstewart: kkania: how come?
[2013-08-06 08:42:03] Abtin: Same error with PHP-WebDriver
[2013-08-06 08:42:24] simonstewart: kkania: or, more precisely, how are they using the functionality?
[2013-08-06 08:42:25] Dude-X: selenium will be sufficient to automate it but it won't be super fast. if that's ok, go for it!
[2013-08-06 08:42:55] kkania: with the current w3 proposal, they have to do: driver.findElementByCssSelector('outer-shell').switchToSubTree().findElementByCssSelector('header').switchToSubTree().findElementByCssSelector('search-bar').switchToSubTree().findElementById('search-input').type('something')
[2013-08-06 08:43:13] kkania: that was one user case
[2013-08-06 08:43:13] simonstewart: Well, that's a hint if ever there was one
[2013-08-06 08:43:17] phasze: dimacus: hehe, I take it stop_grid isn't working?
[2013-08-06 08:43:27] simonstewart: Why are the DOMs so deeply nested?
[2013-08-06 08:43:39] Gwildor: Dude-X_: selenium can build 10-15 objects for me, and all the other crap i need, even if it takes 3x the time for me to do it manually.....i can still be doing other things..
[2013-08-06 08:43:42] simonstewart: ANd are they using page objects?
[2013-08-06 08:43:43] dimacus: phasze:  it was working on linux just fine, never got to test it on windwos
[2013-08-06 08:43:47] Gwildor: Dude-X_: is there a 'faster' alternative ?
[2013-08-06 08:43:55] kkania: idk, i'm trying to get more details from the user
[2013-08-06 08:44:04] simonstewart: That'd be handy
[2013-08-06 08:44:13] simonstewart: Would love to better understand the use case
[2013-08-06 08:44:15] Dude-X: Gwildor: still using the web driver API, you can use something like Ghostdriver which is headless
[2013-08-06 08:44:30] kkania: regardless of this case, it seems maybe using the switch to is a bit heavy, since they all share the same js context
[2013-08-06 08:44:33] Abtin: @lukeis : I've post it at your gist
[2013-08-06 08:44:51] phasze: dimacus: hmm, maybe it's because I tried to start a node when one was already started
[2013-08-06 08:44:54] phasze: time to test again
[2013-08-06 08:45:02] simonstewart: kkania: but they're not the same DOM
[2013-08-06 08:45:07] lukeis: Abtin: ok, what's the output of the var dump?
[2013-08-06 08:45:12] dimacus: phasze:  test away!
[2013-08-06 08:45:14] simonstewart: So how do you differentiate between the different trees?

[2013-08-06 08:47:27] lukeis: Abtin: what version of the standalone server and what version of firefox?
[2013-08-06 08:48:10] kkania: simonstewart: maybe a new method, getSubtree(index), which returns an element ref for the shadow root, and then they can use that for doing additional find element stuff; this is basically the same as the switch to, except a bit lighter weight

[2013-08-06 08:49:00] simonstewart: So you're thinking of grabbing a subtree hosted on the same node?
[2013-08-06 08:49:09] kkania: well, those are separate documents, while shadow dom is just a doc fragment

[2013-08-06 08:49:39] dimacus: ahhh
[2013-08-06 08:49:42] simonstewart: Sure, but the DOM nodes within each of the trees are separate
[2013-08-06 08:50:05] simonstewart: So you can't find an element in one shadow dom without actually being in that dom
[2013-08-06 08:50:42] dimacus: phasze:  if you have some free time to fix it please doâ€¦ i'm trying to finish this thing up this week http://i.imgur.com/pLP2a9W.jpg

[2013-08-06 09:05:01] kkania: simonstewart: my point is just that it might be simpler for the user to treat shadow trees as part of the main document target, instead of having to switch back and forward; i see no real advantage in the latter

[2013-08-06 10:02:03] jimevans: :)
[2013-08-06 10:02:12] jimevans: still the answer is yes, right?

[2013-08-06 10:12:36] nirvdrum, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-08-06 10:12:37] Abtin: so it means I have to assign it to object and then use _>text() ?

[2013-08-06 10:13:07] lukeis: i'm not sure with phpâ€¦ if you use the element-34 php bindings, there should be examples

[2013-08-06 10:16:31] jimevans: i'm sorry? say what? i've not been paying attention.
[2013-08-06 10:17:05] lukeis: normal element id's a long UUIDsâ€¦ but when run through the standalone server  start off with 0, then increment
[2013-08-06 10:17:47] jimevans: actually, yeah, i think i did know that.
[2013-08-06 10:17:59] lukeis: seems quite odd
[2013-08-06 10:18:26] jimevans: every "server" has its own element id generation scheme.
[2013-08-06 10:18:37] jimevans: should be opaque to the user
[2013-08-06 10:19:33] Abtin: so we cannot get elements id this way?

[2013-08-06 11:59:38] AutomatedTester: other than pypi will be asked for a new dependency in the setup
[2013-08-06 12:00:32] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester,  ok cool.  but you can also use it natively? (without webdriver)
[2013-08-06 12:00:42] AutomatedTester: yes
[2013-08-06 12:01:09] AutomatedTester: marionette api has things that dont fall under how webdriver automates things
[2013-08-06 12:01:19] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, any advantages?  deeper FF integration
[2013-08-06 12:01:26] AutomatedTester: yea
[2013-08-06 12:01:39] AutomatedTester: automating the browser chrome
[2013-08-06 12:02:16] jimevans: so do we have a plan going forward for native events integration? are we planning on cutting over from the native events binary libraries right at v24? or will marionette be ready for that level of integration yet?
[2013-08-06 12:02:46] AutomatedTester: marionette isnt ready for everyday use in FF24
[2013-08-06 12:02:55] jimevans: right. understood
[2013-08-06 12:03:04] AutomatedTester: not unless you just want FfOS

[2013-08-06 12:24:03] jimevans: AutomatedTester: would it be worthwhile to port mozprofile to other languages for marionette support (or at least the part that sets up a clean profile)?
[2013-08-06 12:24:29] jimevans: i feel like the java and .net firefox profile bits for the current firefox driver are not as streamlined as they ought to be.
[2013-08-06 12:25:56] AutomatedTester: jimevans: i would say yes
[2013-08-06 12:26:44] jimevans: guess i'll have to brush up on my python

[2013-08-06 12:35:47] lukeis: thx
[2013-08-06 12:36:07] jleyba: Why is it included in the java changelog?  It's node specific
[2013-08-06 12:36:46] jimevans: jleyba: because i saw information about changes to webdriverjs in previous versions, so i blindly followed the pattern?

[2013-08-06 13:02:33] phasze: but the teardown is executing after driver.Quit() isn't it?
[2013-08-06 13:03:05] phasze: I don't see how putting something higher up in teardown would make it execute before the browser closes

[2013-08-06 14:51:37] lukeis: the youtube linked also doesn't use maven
[2013-08-06 14:51:40] LeslieM: BTW - thanks for the help!
