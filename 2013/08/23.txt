[2013-08-23 03:03:31] weeb1e: My chrome webdriver stopped working in the night, after having used it for over a year... Less than 12 hours ago (perhaps after a chrome browser update), it starts giving the error described here: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=6152
[2013-08-23 03:04:31] weeb1e: After doing some research, it sounded like the solution was to update to chromedriver 2.2, but after doing that, and updating my selenium webdriver, my whole application is broken
[2013-08-23 03:05:17] weeb1e: Various selenium webdriver calls such as driver.manage.window.resize_to and move_to no longer work, and just block for many seconds before failing silently

[2013-08-23 03:19:30] weeb1e: I guess I will have to wait for selenium-webdriver to be updated, like everyone else

[2013-08-23 06:29:54] bfife: anyone _really_ good with python?
[2013-08-23 06:30:01] bfife: (in general)
[2013-08-23 06:30:26] kilink: what's the question?
[2013-08-23 06:31:00] bfife: just about comparing the following two statements:
[2013-08-23 06:31:06] bfife: if not(x == "value"):
[2013-08-23 06:31:10] bfife: if x != "value":
[2013-08-23 06:31:14] bfife: is the first more expensive?
[2013-08-23 06:31:47] bfife: or will python realize that it's basically #2, and execute as such
[2013-08-23 06:31:52] kilink: I don't think so, but I would have to look at the byte code they generate to be sure
[2013-08-23 06:32:02] kilink: it is slightly different in that they are executing different methods potentially
[2013-08-23 06:32:20] AutomatedTester: bfife: what do you mean by expensive?
[2013-08-23 06:32:38] kilink: __eq__ vs __ne__, but in the general case they will both do a __cmp__
[2013-08-23 06:32:45] bfife: expensive as in, it's an additional operation
[2013-08-23 06:32:59] *jimevans head a splode!'
[2013-08-23 06:33:03] bfife: also, it looks awkward
[2013-08-23 06:33:05] kilink: I don't think it's worth worrying about
[2013-08-23 06:33:17] kilink: x != "value" seems better to me
[2013-08-23 06:33:32] AutomatedTester: its a micro optimization imho
[2013-08-23 06:33:48] kilink: it's also more idiomatic python imo
[2013-08-23 06:35:26] bfife: indeed

[2013-08-23 08:29:15] cgoldberg: was going to merge them into my branch...
[2013-08-23 08:30:04] cgoldberg: but I'm not really happy with those docs.  there is some useful stuff in there indeed.. but I don't think it's good enough to be an official doc, without some serious rework and completion

[2013-08-23 08:34:01] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: agreed

[2013-08-23 08:35:25] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, so pick out best content and create a proper official doc?
[2013-08-23 08:35:46] AutomatedTester: best of both and create new
[2013-08-23 08:35:49] AutomatedTester: yea
[2013-08-23 08:36:21] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, well.. for existing docs in the python tree, there is just an index.st, and then the auto-generated API docs (which should def stay as-is)
[2013-08-23 08:36:42] cgoldberg: so not much for existing to merge
[2013-08-23 08:36:55] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: I reckon we could update our docstrings
[2013-08-23 08:36:56] cgoldberg: index.rst rather
[2013-08-23 08:37:01] AutomatedTester: so that we have best of both
[2013-08-23 08:37:08] cgoldberg: right
[2013-08-23 08:38:33] cgoldberg: for now, if possible, I'd like to land my pull request (104) .. which just updates README and index.rst  .... I can get to working on merging bits to form a good doc in a future branch

[2013-08-23 10:28:30] jimevans: barancev: there isn't one. all an element knows is what document it belongs to.
[2013-08-23 10:28:47] barancev: it does not scroll to an element if it belongs to am iframe
[2013-08-23 10:28:58] jimevans: most anything that deals with frames in IE isn't done with the atoms.
[2013-08-23 10:30:15] jimevans: if you want the gory details of all the offal that you have to wade through to figure that out for an element in IE, look at Element::AppendFrameDetails
[2013-08-23 10:30:21] jimevans: (in element.cpp)

[2013-08-23 11:11:40] legind: Q: I have tests running in parallel using the FirefoxDriver, but even when I specify a separate FirefoxProfile for each, the sessions are shared between them.  How do I have each test run in isolation, not sharing any cookies/sessions?
[2013-08-23 11:12:09] dimacus: legind:  are you using profiles?
[2013-08-23 11:12:32] legind: dimacus: yes, I'm creating a random profile in /tmp for each test
[2013-08-23 11:12:51] dimacus: that's odd… the cookies and sessions should never jump between instance of profiles
[2013-08-23 11:13:47] legind: it looks like the profiles aren't created though... do I have to create a ff profile beforehand, or can selenium do that for me?

[2013-08-23 11:17:57] legind: cgoldberg: yes, nose
[2013-08-23 11:18:09] dimacus: legind:  so there is something similar in ruby
[2013-08-23 11:18:10] dimacus: profile = Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Profile.new
[2013-08-23 11:18:27] dimacus:  Selenium::WebDriver.for browser, options
[2013-08-23 11:18:33] dimacus: where options contiains the new profile
[2013-08-23 11:18:39] cgoldberg: legind, cool.  i have no probs with concurrency... but each of my Firefox instances gets a profile passed in
[2013-08-23 11:18:56] dimacus: this way when you ask for a new instance of FF you explicitly create a new profile
[2013-08-23 11:19:04] dimacus: not sure what py equivlent is

[2013-08-23 11:33:13] jleyba: lukeis: your change to ExpectedConditions.not() is causing all sorts of havoc with   "not(visibilityOf(element))"
[2013-08-23 11:33:37] jleyba: I've found a few cases where the test was legitimately broken and the bug in not() was masking that

[2013-08-23 13:29:56] barancev: bot.action.scrollIntoView does not scroll if an element is in a frame and the frame is not in the view
[2013-08-23 13:30:26] cgoldberg: arg.. someone gave me an old dell "netbook" to revive for them :/   ... I used to have this same model, and it's a pain to get most linux distros on this thing
[2013-08-23 13:30:35] barancev: the second one is not investigated yet
[2013-08-23 13:31:27] barancev: I can fix the first one but I suspect googlers are working on the same task
[2013-08-23 13:31:41] barancev: jleyba: ^^^ ?
[2013-08-23 13:31:47] jimevans: ah. a good question for jleyba.
[2013-08-23 13:32:37] jleyba: jimevans: I'm working on the svg document failures
[2013-08-23 13:32:56] barancev: and I can't reproduce atom overflow_test failure locally
[2013-08-23 13:33:32] jimevans: jleyba: no worries, mate. that's a great goal; happy to hear it.
[2013-08-23 13:34:27] barancev: ok then I'll commit a fix for "an element in a frame"
[2013-08-23 13:35:17] jleyba: barancev: put that logic in firefox specific code or something in the webdriver.atoms namespace
[2013-08-23 13:36:38] barancev: jleyba: why do you think it is firefox-specific?
[2013-08-23 13:36:51] jlipps, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-23 13:37:00] jleyba: i don't.. mainly just meant don't put it in bot.*

[2013-08-23 13:38:46] barancev: does it cross frame boundaries?
[2013-08-23 13:39:23] barancev: and why bot.action.scrollIntoView should ignore frames?
[2013-08-23 13:40:03] barancev: frames (iframes) can be out of view and should be scrolled
[2013-08-23 13:41:22] barancev: actually we don't need anything special, element.scrollIntoView() does its job well

[2013-08-23 13:48:29] jimevans: what'd i do this time?

[2013-08-23 13:48:57] jimevans: jleyba: don't be so sure. :)
[2013-08-23 13:49:05] jleyba: fixed one of the bugs with svg documents, but trying to get the unit test to play nicely in all versions of IE is proving rather difficult
[2013-08-23 13:49:21] jimevans: there's that whole #ifdef JLEYBA_IS_USING flag in the code base.
[2013-08-23 13:49:53] jimevans: oh, it won't work in all versions of IE. you silly silly man.

[2013-08-23 14:02:35] jleyba: barancev: your patch creates an inconsistency for b/w elements that do and do not have scrollIntoView defined
[2013-08-23 14:03:09] jleyba: scrollIntoView would take care of the frame, but the manual scrolling would not
[2013-08-23 14:03:43] barancev: true
[2013-08-23 14:03:56] barancev: and you вщтже want to implement it at all, right?
[2013-08-23 14:04:07] barancev: and you don't want to implement it at all, right?
[2013-08-23 14:04:42] barancev: because it breaks frame boundaries...
[2013-08-23 14:06:15] jleyba: trying to handle frames adds a lot of complexity
[2013-08-23 14:06:38] jleyba: things are much simpler if we keep bot.* restricted to a single frame
[2013-08-23 14:06:43] barancev: what to do if they present?
[2013-08-23 14:07:11] jleyba: (for instance, bot.dom.isShown only checks an element's ownerDocument, it does not check if the enclosing frame is also visible)
[2013-08-23 14:07:25] barancev: so it's a bug :)
[2013-08-23 14:07:40] jleyba: no, that is very very much a conscious decision
[2013-08-23 14:08:08] barancev: disagree. what if you want to click it?
[2013-08-23 14:09:13] barancev: following this way we can say "css transform adds a lot of complexity, let's ignore it", etc
[2013-08-23 14:10:04] barancev: visibilty, scrolling, location calculation should take frames into account
[2013-08-23 14:10:11] barancev: al least iframes
[2013-08-23 14:10:26] barancev: that are not rare in modern apps

[2013-08-23 14:11:33] jleyba: how do you handle cross domain frames?
[2013-08-23 14:12:11] jleyba: the FirefoxDriver is the *only* driver that can execute JS without the limits of SOP
[2013-08-23 14:12:16] barancev: in IE we do it in C++ code
[2013-08-23 14:12:28] jleyba: but you can't do it via JS with IE
[2013-08-23 14:12:32] jleyba: and the atoms are JS...sooooo
[2013-08-23 14:12:32] barancev: right
[2013-08-23 14:12:46] barancev: so?
[2013-08-23 14:13:22] barancev: ... we can't implement browser neutral scrolling.
[2013-08-23 14:14:12] barancev: of course we can recommend to NOT use native events in FF, that solves the problem
[2013-08-23 14:14:27] barancev: synthesized events don't need scrolling
[2013-08-23 14:15:14] barancev: or we can hope marionette will implement scrolling without use of atoms
[2013-08-23 14:15:23] jleyba: <pseudo code>var frameStack = [];   frame = element.ownerDoc.window; while (frame != window.top) frameStack.push(frame)
[2013-08-23 14:15:29] barancev: and atoms will not be used by no driver
[2013-08-23 14:15:38] jleyba: frameStack.forEach () -> frame.scrollIntoView()
[2013-08-23 14:15:39] barancev: I mean "scrolling atoms"
[2013-08-23 14:15:45] jleyba: el.scrollIntoView()
[2013-08-23 14:15:52] jleyba: </pseudo code>
