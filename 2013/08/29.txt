[2013-08-29 02:39:02] javajunky: Can anyone point me at any resources for whether to use CSS or XPath selectors (all the references I can find are fairly old, and recommend CSS over XPath for speed) .. is this still true with modern IE ?

[2013-08-29 03:08:03] barancev|2: javajunky: benchmark yourself
[2013-08-29 03:08:18] barancev|2: with the exact locators you need
[2013-08-29 03:09:03] javajunky: barancev|2: yeah indeed, am doing so, but wanted to know if the generally pointed to advice still holds true :)
[2013-08-29 03:09:33] barancev|2: no it is not, in general
[2013-08-29 03:10:49] barancev|2: my benchmarks show that 1) findElement and findElements IE is slow, it can be 10-30 times slower than Chrome or FF
[2013-08-29 03:12:09] barancev|2: 2) dependency 'time / the number of element found by a locator' is not linear in IE, unlike Chrome and FF
[2013-08-29 03:12:51] barancev|2: 3) there is no big difference between XPath and CSS in IE7+
[2013-08-29 03:19:41] javajunky: ok, thank you this is interesting, so given #3 and a fair proportion of my selectors require 'find element <foo> with text <bar>' are very slow with the CSS approach, there's no reason why I shouldn't swap them out to use XPath (we only care about IE9+)

[2013-08-29 03:40:49] barancev|2: javajunky: "with text <bar>?" it is not supported by CSS. are you sure you use "real CSS" not Sizzle?
[2013-08-29 03:44:15] javajunky:  barancev|2 you are indeed correct, which is why its slower, I have to pull back all the matching elements and check them in the C# for text content ..hence the slowness.
[2013-08-29 03:46:23] asavchuk: canobi: stress testing of what? SUT ?
[2013-08-29 03:57:17] canobi: asavchuk: A multimedia-serving web application (think of something like various video on-demand sites). So my question is twofold (just to nudge me in the right direction): Can I run a script recorded with Selenium IDE in the grid? And two - if that script has a variable that needs to change during each run (a username/password combo), can it be done in some standard way? So, I'm just trying to find out if I'm on the right track (I assumed a "yes" answer
[2013-08-29 03:57:43] canobi: as I assumed
[2013-08-29 03:58:32] barancev|2: why do you need selenium for this task?
[2013-08-29 03:58:40] barancev|2: do you want to stress a server?
[2013-08-29 03:59:06] barancev|2: or a set of clients that run browsers with a media-player?
[2013-08-29 04:00:01] barancev|2: to stress a server you'd better use more appropriate tools that work on protocol level, selenium is overkill
[2013-08-29 04:00:39] canobi: Both - to stress test the application and media serving. Basically, a user-experience simulator if you will. The application itself was already attacked with jmeter, now I need something that will give me a complete picture
[2013-08-29 04:02:27] barancev|2: ok, the answer is: yes you can run a script recorder by IDE in the grid, but you have to convert it to a programming language of your choise
[2013-08-29 04:02:40] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-29 04:02:41] barancev|2: s/recorder/recorded/
[2013-08-29 04:03:26] barancev|2: and use a framework that can run many scenarious in parallel
[2013-08-29 04:03:32] canobi: Great, and that also answers my second quesiton :-D
[2013-08-29 04:03:41] barancev|2: btw, do you know jmeter has a wwebdriver plugin?
[2013-08-29 04:04:14] barancev|2: http://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/WebDriverSet/
[2013-08-29 04:05:39] canobi: Didn't know that, interesting... If I could use that, it could be even more simple as I'm much more familiar with jmeter, thanks, I'll take a look right now.
[2013-08-29 04:05:40] barancev|2: unfortunately Selenium IDE does not have a formatter that exports a scenario to a format that can be paste into this plugin, some manual work required
[2013-08-29 04:06:15] canobi: The scenario itself is not complex, so that's OK

[2013-08-29 07:35:16] simonstewart: What's the lifecycle of a Selendroid instance?
[2013-08-29 07:35:47] simonstewart: My intern just mentioned that each use of selendroid requires a brand new emulator instance
[2013-08-29 07:35:51] simonstewart: Which seems novel to me
[2013-08-29 07:35:58] simonstewart: Wanted to see what I'm missing :)
[2013-08-29 07:36:36] ddary: if you use the selendroid standalone, then it means in the end, that between each session a new emulator is started
[2013-08-29 07:36:37] AutomatedTester: chocolate?
[2013-08-29 07:36:41] AutomatedTester: missing chocolate?
[2013-08-29 07:36:59] ddary: if you use the selendroid-server, you can do what ever you want
[2013-08-29 07:37:19] simonstewart: ok
[2013-08-29 07:37:30] ddary: the reason for doing it (at the standalone server) is to be selenium like
[2013-08-29 07:37:41] ddary: you also get a new fresh browser
[2013-08-29 07:37:49] simonstewart: Right, but not a fresh OS
[2013-08-29 07:37:51] simonstewart: :)
[2013-08-29 07:38:05] ddary: right
[2013-08-29 07:38:10] p_l, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-29 07:38:13] simonstewart: OK. For my use case, emaultor/android instance lifecycles are controlled by Something Else
[2013-08-29 07:38:23] simonstewart: So it sounds like using the server is the way forward
[2013-08-29 07:38:33] ddary: yeah
[2013-08-29 07:38:49] ddary: with that component you can do whatever you want
[2013-08-29 07:39:39] ddary: the only thing that is not perfect there, is the taking screenshot approach, that is the reason why I'm using in the standalone server the ddmliv library for that
[2013-08-29 07:40:04] ddary: *ddmlib*
[2013-08-29 07:40:43] ddary: and btw, if you look at code, you should look at the dev branch ...

[2013-08-29 08:12:12] Ardesco: simonstewart: that it's brilliant and Selenium 3 will be a maven based project?

[2013-08-29 08:52:08] lukeis: Ardesco: equivalent distance is SF -> LA… is $63 … but takes 13 hours  (by train).   Bus is about the same price and is about same price and takes 12 hours (because of all the stops)…. so, people either plane (1 hr, typically less than $150) or drive (5~6 hours)…. c'mon hyperloop! ;)
[2013-08-29 08:52:32] Ardesco: so here it's faster by plane and cheaper by pnae
[2013-08-29 08:52:51] lukeis: ;)
[2013-08-29 08:52:54] Oscar_Rieken: so you are saying if i get a job in london paying me 100k then I could live in scotland and commute for 30 a day
[2013-08-29 08:53:13] Ardesco: that's probably £30 each way + airport taxes
[2013-08-29 08:53:28] Ardesco: but once in london you'll need underground
[2013-08-29 08:53:31] Ardesco: :)
[2013-08-29 08:53:45] Ardesco: and you'll need to get to the airport
[2013-08-29 08:53:57] lukeis: $100k… ~£100 / day   -> $160 / day
[2013-08-29 08:54:19] lukeis: that's a lot to be spending on commute
[2013-08-29 08:54:37] Oscar_Rieken: yeah
[2013-08-29 08:54:58] Oscar_Rieken: i meant £100k
[2013-08-29 08:55:33] lukeis: still $100k with $100/day commute is a bit much
[2013-08-29 08:56:07] Oscar_Rieken: agreed
[2013-08-29 08:56:14] lukeis: i spend ~ $13 / day  on my commute :)

[2013-08-29 08:56:23] Oscar_Rieken: also i dont know if i would move to the UK
[2013-08-29 08:57:00] Ardesco: but if it's a regular commute you get discounts on trains
[2013-08-29 08:57:25] Ardesco: so you'd have to find out the charter price for regular flights
[2013-08-29 08:57:34] Oscar_Rieken: im around 6 a full tank will last me 10 work days in my new truck, in my gti im aound 20 a day but its much more fun to drive
[2013-08-29 08:57:37] Ardesco: I still think with enough people it will probably work out even
[2013-08-29 08:57:54] Ardesco: $6 per full tank
[2013-08-29 08:57:57] Ardesco: bastard
[2013-08-29 08:58:35] Ardesco: costs me just over £100 for a full tank
[2013-08-29 08:58:38] lukeis: ?  gas is like $4.50 / gallon   so $60+ per full tank
[2013-08-29 08:58:45] Oscar_Rieken: i mean 60 to fill the tank, averages out to about 6 a day
[2013-08-29 08:59:05] ibl: oh dudes... i'm still contemplating whether or not to get a drivers lisence, if i can actually afford it

[2013-08-29 08:59:37] Ardesco: it's different to a uk one isn't it

[2013-08-29 09:00:17] lukeis: Ardesco: sorry 3.78 :)
[2013-08-29 09:00:19] jimevans: lukeis: doublecheck your math.
[2013-08-29 09:00:27] jimevans: hah. beat me to it.
[2013-08-29 09:00:30] Ardesco: :)
[2013-08-29 09:00:38] lukeis: i don't know what I was thinking ;)
[2013-08-29 09:00:49] jimevans: 2.2 us pounds/kg.
[2013-08-29 09:00:57] lukeis: ahh
[2013-08-29 09:01:00] Ardesco: so it;s £5.37 a gallon for fuel round here
[2013-08-29 09:01:01] Oscar_Rieken: 18.5 gallons is 70 liters
[2013-08-29 09:01:36] lukeis: Ardesco: that's $9 / gallon…. we're about half that
[2013-08-29 09:01:46] Ardesco: stupid tax on fuel
[2013-08-29 09:02:16] lukeis: heh, and we have taxes on fuel which is most of the cost ;)
[2013-08-29 09:02:32] lukeis: your taxes are insane :-D

[2013-08-29 09:04:10] Ardesco: :)
[2013-08-29 09:04:23] lukeis: i only got *some* because my company *paid for it*
[2013-08-29 09:04:42] Ardesco: company pays for it in the UK as well
[2013-08-29 09:04:49] Ardesco: they can then claim some tax back from the government
[2013-08-29 09:05:09] Ardesco: forgotten what the statutory fee is
[2013-08-29 09:05:14] Ardesco: something like £50/week

[2013-08-29 09:06:28] Ardesco: I have no issue with the NHS
[2013-08-29 09:07:00] Ardesco: my eldest was in SCBU for 4 weeks when he was born, care was great and I'm glad it's something I didn't have to pay for
[2013-08-29 09:07:14] Ardesco: would have bankrupted me
[2013-08-29 09:07:31] jimevans: Ardesco: we had to visit a hospital while in london for seconf.
[2013-08-29 09:07:55] Ardesco: :(
[2013-08-29 09:07:59] lukeis: well, my second was in NICU for ~1 week… thankfully insurance covered most of it, but I was still out of pocket about $1.5k
[2013-08-29 09:08:50] lukeis: initially the hospital sent us the bill instead of to our insurance…. $90k! (and that wasn't even for the whole thing)
[2013-08-29 09:09:08] *lukeis almost had a heart attack when i saw that'
[2013-08-29 09:09:24] Ardesco: yup the cost of that sort of thing is unbelievable
[2013-08-29 09:10:05] Oscar_Rieken: wow def glad for insurance
[2013-08-29 09:10:34] lukeis: i'd be more glad for national health care and not have to worry about it
[2013-08-29 09:11:07] lukeis: hospital visits are stressful enough… thinking about paying for it… why do we add that stress to ourselves?

[2013-08-29 09:15:51] Oscar_Rieken: I would just add pry and put one before it "freezes or timesout" and poke around

[2013-08-29 09:20:52] Dude-X: i am a US citizen, born in NYC. we are also legally married, but i call her my fiancee because she doesn't consider it official until the wedding ceremony in a church
[2013-08-29 09:21:07] lukeis: heh
[2013-08-29 09:21:34] jds: Oscar_Rieken: figuring out exactly where the freeze is occuring is part of the problem

[2013-08-29 09:23:26] Oscar_Rieken: not sure about that I'd go ask in the #capybara channel like lukeis said seems to me more of a capybara talking to webdriver issue
[2013-08-29 09:23:59] jds: Mm.  I suspect they'll say it's Selenium's fault, but I'll try

[2013-08-29 10:24:59] Dude-X: in my experience there are some settings that can't be set via webdriver
[2013-08-29 10:25:07] phdjsep: oh
[2013-08-29 10:25:17] Dude-X: they are read only preferences for some reason
[2013-08-29 10:25:37] phdjsep: hmm, that's thought provoking
[2013-08-29 10:25:55] phdjsep: It seems I'm able to set it though
[2013-08-29 10:26:12] phdjsep: just in the lowercase 'default_preferences' not the uppercase one
[2013-08-29 10:26:38] Dude-X: still that's just a python dictionary
[2013-08-29 10:26:44] Dude-X: does it actually set it in the browser?
[2013-08-29 10:27:14] jds: One of the chrome-freezes I'm seeing occurs when Capybara tries to reset its session after a run.  It calls "@browser.navigate.to('about:blank')", but Remote::Driver#raw_execute never returns

[2013-08-29 14:20:27] lukeis: Ahmed_: do you see the app start in your emulator?
[2013-08-29 14:20:32] Ahmed_: no
[2013-08-29 14:20:51] lukeis: ok, yeah… looks like the package name, and I'm not sure why
[2013-08-29 14:21:14] Ahmed_: that's weird
[2013-08-29 14:21:21] lukeis: does the class objects in the app and the class name in AndroidManifest.xml match up?
[2013-08-29 14:21:28] lukeis: (you can't mismatch them right now)

[2013-08-29 14:22:57] Ahmed_: they match
[2013-08-29 14:24:22] lukeis: doesn't look like it…. selendroid thinks your main activity is under the package "com.facebook.testing.bully"  but your AndroidManifest.xml has "com.facebook.home.dev"  (according to the output)
[2013-08-29 14:25:00] lukeis: hopefully the manifest is just "com.facebook" and that would fix it
