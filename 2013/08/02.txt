[2013-08-02 04:32:31] tasslehoff: asavchuk: thanks. so "Element Should Be Visible" should work?
[2013-08-02 04:33:51] tasslehoff: hmm. no.
[2013-08-02 04:34:05] asavchuk: rstrazhnyk: there is. but it depends on how your pop-up is implemented - if it's system alert window, use switch to alert. if it's just html element, use wait until visible + switch to frame if needed.
[2013-08-02 04:34:29] asavchuk: rstrazhnyk: if your pop-up is different window use switch to window.
[2013-08-02 04:34:58] asavchuk: tasslehoff: should work from my point of view. maybe timeout is needed?
[2013-08-02 04:35:21] rstrazhnyk: hi, asavchuk. It's not an alert.  it is another window
[2013-08-02 04:35:56] rstrazhnyk: but how to switch to another window, if driver.window_handles returns just one
[2013-08-02 04:36:08] rstrazhnyk: it is working in ff ok
[2013-08-02 04:36:11] asavchuk: rstrazhnyk: then switch to window should work, i think. but be note that sometimes some tries are necessary - window is not opened immediately
[2013-08-02 04:36:18] asavchuk: rstrazhnyk: IE ?
[2013-08-02 04:36:23] rstrazhnyk: yes

[2013-08-02 04:37:58] asavchuk: hm. looks like there is an issue with it - someone already report this problem. could you provide TRACE log ? at least at this issue i could not reproduce it at my ie8+win7 node
[2013-08-02 04:38:25] tasslehoff: asavchuk: that didn't help. I can see the statusfield, but the test doesn't agre. back to the drawing board :)

[2013-08-02 04:45:26] asavchuk: dhanush: also solution with multiargument function/lamdda will not work - WebdriwerWait.until call passed method with one parameter only.
[2013-08-02 04:46:06] dhanush: asavchuk: wait is ui.WebDriverWait(driver, 30)
[2013-08-02 04:46:18] dhanush: asavchuk: I dont get the multiargument part

[2013-08-02 04:49:36] asavchuk: rstrazhnyk: for TRACE log i mean IEDriverServer TRACE log. if you use grid pass capabilities logFile="<file-path>" and logLevel="TRACE" during driver instanciating. it will generate at <file-path>  TRACE log of IEDriverServer. Could you paste it ?
[2013-08-02 04:49:48] asavchuk: rstrazhnyk: sorry for misunderstanding
[2013-08-02 04:49:57] rstrazhnyk: ok I have it
[2013-08-02 04:50:33] dhanush: asavchuk: Thats the entire script. http://pastebin.com/qpEU6A8e But if you read till the first part of the try block in the function named test_login, you will be able to understand what I am trying to accomplish
[2013-08-02 04:53:11] asavchuk: dhanush: i'm not python expert, but wait.until() argument need to be callable function/lambda. but for wait.until(locate_element(driver, "login_box")) case wait.until just got found webelement.

[2013-08-02 07:52:31] asavchuk: bigon: or just uninstall, cleanup, install firefox :)

[2013-08-02 07:59:12] Androidnewbe: i have a question
[2013-08-02 07:59:37] sspy: Hi all, I'm using last chrome and selenium. Element is visible, but I get ElementNotVisibleException. How do I solve this ?
[2013-08-02 08:00:55] asavchuk: Androidnewbe: :ask
[2013-08-02 08:00:55] selbot2: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[2013-08-02 08:01:07] Androidnewbe: lets say your driving test need to click o a button "show" that shows a table (sets css dispaly to "inline" ) and thank click a link in that table.  does the webdriver watits untill the table is visible ? or do i need to specifically make it wait ?
[2013-08-02 08:01:37] Androidnewbe: bassically my driver cannot find certain elemets
[2013-08-02 08:02:10] Androidnewbe: elements*
[2013-08-02 08:02:20] Androidnewbe: im just wondering how it works
[2013-08-02 08:03:18] Androidnewbe: or the elements are alwasy there so i dont even need to "show" them ? that is what i though at first but since i cannot find sometimes i confused

[2013-08-02 08:05:40] Androidnewbe: asavchuk: ill have a look thanks
[2013-08-02 08:05:58] Androidnewbe: but could you just answer in like simple sentence
[2013-08-02 08:05:59] Androidnewbe: ?
[2013-08-02 08:06:02] sspy: Can it be usable in my case ?
[2013-08-02 08:06:03] asavchuk: also you could use WebdriverWait to perform some action periodically with timeout, i.e. checking of element visibility
[2013-08-02 08:07:13] asavchuk: Androidnewbe: yes, you could tell webdriver to wait some period of time until it find element.
[2013-08-02 08:07:23] phasze: Androidnewbe: We have the same thing in our product and I always wait for visible before clicking another item inside something that was previously hidden.
[2013-08-02 08:07:49] asavchuk: it's named implicit wait.
[2013-08-02 08:07:58] Androidnewbe: phasze: but in theory you shouldn't have to do that right ? is thsi like a bug in selenium ?
[2013-08-02 08:08:20] phasze: No, it's the age of problem of "when is the page *really* loaded"
[2013-08-02 08:08:30] Androidnewbe: how do i know for which things i need to make it wait explicitly and for which not ?
[2013-08-02 08:08:35] phasze: especially if you have ajax calls
[2013-08-02 08:09:07] asavchuk: sspy: do you use last chromedriver version?
[2013-08-02 08:09:54] sspy: asavchuk: yes, 2.1
[2013-08-02 08:10:27] phasze: Androidnewbe: I think it basically depends on the product you're testing.  With ours the pages are always changing and as a safe practice I usually wait for something to be visible or present almost all the time
[2013-08-02 08:10:48] phasze: before interacting with it

[2013-08-02 08:12:26] sspy: one more curiosity, I use implicitly_wait(30), but when element is not visible it throws an exception without waiting those 30 seconds
[2013-08-02 08:13:06] phasze: Androidnewbe: Also I think each browser driver detects the page as loaded differently so in general it's a good idea to wait for your element anyway
[2013-08-02 08:13:43] p0deje, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-08-02 08:14:02] Dave_B_: doesn't implicitly_wait just wait for it to exist not to be visible?
[2013-08-02 08:14:28] Dave_B_: maybe not, i can't remember - I always use explicit waits to keep from getting myself confused
[2013-08-02 08:14:51] asavchuk: hm. does explicit wait help ?

[2013-08-02 12:46:41] RexButler: there
[2013-08-02 12:47:39] lukeis: personally, the only place I put assertions is in Tests… everywhere else (helper, page objects, etc) throws Exceptions of some variety

[2013-08-02 15:34:12] davidlai: I think selenium best practices are programming best practices in general
[2013-08-02 15:34:40] davidlai: for the most part.  the thing you'll want to read up on is Page objects and how to use them.
[2013-08-02 15:34:42] arex\\: there are a lot of selenium specific things
[2013-08-02 15:35:11] davidlai: other wise modularize like any other code, and avoid nested if statements.  (usually means you have high level and low level logic mixed, which is bad for tests)
[2013-08-02 15:35:14] barancev: 5 books!
[2013-08-02 15:35:35] barancev: what other testing tool have al least 3? :)

[2013-08-02 15:49:39] barancev: right now? I'm afraid today is friday :)
[2013-08-02 15:50:22] davidlai: not immediate.  I was thinking I'd dabble in some of the low hanging fruits so I can get to know the code base and the build process for the selenium project.
[2013-08-02 15:50:44] barancev: AutomatedTester, lukeis are two persons looking after the pyhon binding
[2013-08-02 15:52:48] davidlai: thanks.  guess I'll talk to them sometime in the future.
[2013-08-02 15:56:44] davidlai: haven't worked too much on a google code project.  How do I submit a pull request?
[2013-08-02 15:57:10] barancev: you can send a PR to the github mirror

[2013-08-02 16:01:22] davidlai: cool.  I guess i'll do the github one.  I'm more familair with that inferface

[2013-08-02 18:27:03] smccarthy: sibichakravarthy: oh wait
[2013-08-02 18:27:06] smccarthy: what is the [1] for ?
[2013-08-02 18:27:25] sibichakravarthy: i'm trying to get only the first occurrence of h5
[2013-08-02 18:27:57] smccarthy: sibichakravarthy: you can probably use driver.find_element_by_xpath("//h5[1]") , or just driver.find_element_by_xpath("//h5")
[2013-08-02 18:28:07] smccarthy: or driver.find_elements_by_xpath("//h5")[1]
[2013-08-02 18:28:25] smccarthy: find_element_by_xpath automatically returns the first element I believe
[2013-08-02 18:28:44] sibichakravarthy: i actually need the second element
[2013-08-02 18:28:46] smccarthy: but also, i think the correct xpath for the first element is //h5[1]  , though I am not good with xpath
[2013-08-02 18:29:03] sibichakravarthy: and this is the exact xpath:
[2013-08-02 18:29:04] sibichakravarthy: category_name=.find_elements_by_xpath(".//h5//a[@href='#']")
[2013-08-02 18:29:32] sibichakravarthy: where shud i insert the index here?
[2013-08-02 18:30:10] smccarthy: with find_elements , in the latest example, at the end... like : ategory_name=.find_elements_by_xpath(".//h5//a[@href='#']")[1]
[2013-08-02 18:30:24] smccarthy: find_elements returns a list of elements
[2013-08-02 18:30:30] smccarthy: find_element only returns a single element
