[2013-08-22 16:18:05] barancev|2: this check returns if an element is in a frame, but not in an overflow block
[2013-08-22 16:18:12] barancev|2: and scrolling does not happen
[2013-08-22 16:19:13] barancev|2: what if we remove this check? (as it was before)
[2013-08-22 16:19:29] jleyba_: there's probably additional logic needed inside FF
[2013-08-22 16:19:44] jleyba_: just to make sure i understand - the element is in frame
[2013-08-22 16:19:52] jleyba_: and that frame needs to be scrolled into view to make the element in view?

[2013-08-22 16:20:36] barancev|2: jleyba_: exactly
[2013-08-22 16:20:56] jleyba_: additional logic is needed in the fxdriver to handle the frame
[2013-08-22 16:20:56] barancev|2: it is required to click with native events
[2013-08-22 16:21:45] barancev|2: we don't need special logic, element.scrollIntoView() handles "frame case"
[2013-08-22 16:22:07] barancev|2: we just have to give it a chance
