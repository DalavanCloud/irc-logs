[2013-08-04 01:33:22] nicegraham: RoySegall: what's the question?
[2013-08-04 01:43:32] benraju, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2013-08-04 01:52:45] RoySegall: nicegraham, didn't saw you answer. Still here?
[2013-08-04 01:54:12] RoySegall: any way - i have the selenium stand alone java file and i have the travis ci service which i'm running the server on his installation on each git commit.
[2013-08-04 01:54:52] RoySegall: The problem is when i start the selenium stand alone on my travis the server runs under the 127.0.0.2 address and not 127.0.0.1
[2013-08-04 01:55:37] RoySegall: The question is: is there an argument in the server which i defined on whch address he will run. i.e - forced him to run under 127.0.0.1
[2013-08-04 01:56:15] nicegraham: RoySegall: -host I think
[2013-08-04 01:56:29] RoySegall: nicegraham, 10x i'll try
[2013-08-04 01:57:11] RoySegall: nicegraham, it suppose to be like java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.32.0.jar -host 127.0.0.3
[2013-08-04 01:57:15] nicegraham: yeah, that should do it, and -port for the port to run on
[2013-08-04 01:58:48] RoySegall: nicegraham, nah... still run under .0.1
[2013-08-04 01:59:24] RoySegall: nicegraham, do you know what causing this?
[2013-08-04 01:59:37] nicegraham: no idea
[2013-08-04 01:59:56] nicegraham: it should run on the ip you give it
[2013-08-04 02:02:20] nicegraham: I assume it does some validation that the ip is valid and maybe it's getting confused there? but I don't really know
