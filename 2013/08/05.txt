[2013-08-05 04:40:33] ronny: barancev: problem is, that as soon as i set the speed from *slow* to fast or export to a program, it breaks
[2013-08-05 04:41:41] barancev: so add some waitForXXX commands

[2013-08-05 04:42:57] barancev: ok, wait for specific element properties (e.g. text)
[2013-08-05 04:43:20] ronny: is there some example what to configure somewhere?
[2013-08-05 04:43:42] barancev: how, as a human, can you understand that "the action is done"?
[2013-08-05 04:44:41] ronny: barancev: i meant to say i have no idea how to use the waitfor in selenium-ide, where are examples of using it for waiting for text to change

[2013-08-05 04:45:59] barancev: you're not waiting for "change"
[2013-08-05 04:46:07] ronny: ok

Android: I'm not saying you shouldn't use headless - I'm just wondering what you're testing. Sometimes you care about what browser you're running on, sometimes you don't.

[2013-08-05 11:24:32] jleyba: We haven't updated the IEDriver in a while, so maybe this just means we need to get on that - or is there anything else we should look at that you can think of?
[2013-08-05 11:26:56] jimevans: that message will happen for exactly one reason. that the driver isn't able to get an IHTMLDocument2 interface by using the WM_HTML_GETOBJECT message (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/249232). if you have logging enabled, you'll see exactly where in that process it's failing with a warning written to the log.
