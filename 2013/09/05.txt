[2013-09-05 12:18:19] nirvdrum: IE you need to set a registry value.
[2013-09-05 12:18:42] nirvdrum: If you use RemoteWebDriver and set the 'proxy' desired capability, Selenium will set up the registry key for you.
[2013-09-05 12:18:51] nirvdrum: Yes, that's an odd step.
[2013-09-05 12:19:01] eutheria: proxy ?
[2013-09-05 12:19:04] nirvdrum: In Safari you need to disable fraudulent web sites.
[2013-09-05 12:19:51] eutheria: is that an option i pass to the jar?
[2013-09-05 12:19:55] nirvdrum: No.

[2013-09-05 12:20:12] eutheria: i just want IE for now
[2013-09-05 12:20:40] nirvdrum: Then your options are do the proxy thing with RemoteWebDriver or go through and manually change the registry key yourself.
