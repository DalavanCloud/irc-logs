[2013-09-30 05:38:40] ychaouche: barancev|2: then with a particular firefox extension, I can see the data present in memory cache
[2013-09-30 05:38:59] ychaouche: my goal is to be able to download that file as html, then parse it using shell commands.
[2013-09-30 05:39:12] barancev|2: that's what I'm asking about -- the purpose
[2013-09-30 05:39:30] barancev|2: can't you get the cache content directly
[2013-09-30 05:39:39] ychaouche: I don't know I wish I could
[2013-09-30 05:40:08] ychaouche: but appearntly firefox holds different sources of data in the same file so it's hard to tell
[2013-09-30 05:41:23] barancev|2: there are tools that can extract files from the cache
[2013-09-30 05:41:28] barancev|2: e.g. http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/mozilla_cache_viewer.html

[2013-09-30 05:44:37] ychaouche: so for example : dosomework.py would open firefox in selenium, get access to some data in the cache then transform it using some linux commands.
[2013-09-30 05:46:00] Dave_B_: can you perhaps break up the cache a bit? Do you need all that stuff cached for whatever you do? 229M is still a bit cache

[2013-09-30 05:49:53] ychaouche: Dave_B_: place it in a temporary location then get it back inside the cache

[2013-09-30 06:42:38] andreastt: HtmlUnitDriver is based on the fully headless HtmlUnit Java browser implementation.
[2013-09-30 06:43:03] drharmony, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-09-30 06:43:12] andreastt: PhantomJS uses WebKit and its framebuffer as a backend.
[2013-09-30 06:43:14] andreastt: AFAIK.
[2013-09-30 06:44:12] ychaouche: so, firefox crashed, webdriver still running, trying to create another Firefox gives me this error : OSError: [Errno 17] File exists: '/tmp/tmpCDlrtA/webdriver-py-profilecopy/extensions/fxdriver@googlecode.com'

[2013-09-30 06:44:21] ychaouche: what can I do ?
[2013-09-30 06:44:22] detronizator_: andreastt: Eravohn: phantomjs is based on QtWebKit (a wrapper of WebKit)
[2013-09-30 06:44:54] ychaouche: also, ff.start_client() doesn't restart the client

[2013-09-30 07:30:21] cgoldberg: ychaouche, strange.. that sounds like a bug.. unless a tab is considered part of the main window?
[2013-09-30 07:30:48] ychaouche: I have no idea

[2013-09-30 07:31:22] ychaouche: thanks, later maybe
[2013-09-30 07:31:33] ychaouche: I have to find a workaround first
[2013-09-30 07:31:40] Dave_B_: possible workaround:

[2013-09-30 07:31:47] Dave_B_: or your language equivalent
[2013-09-30 07:31:54] ychaouche: mm saw that on SO earlier
[2013-09-30 07:32:02] Dave_B_: no luck?
[2013-09-30 07:32:07] ychaouche: Didn't try it
[2013-09-30 07:32:09] ychaouche: yet
[2013-09-30 07:32:10] Dave_B_: ah ok :)
[2013-09-30 07:32:25] ychaouche: that's the equivalent of pressing Ctrl+2
[2013-09-30 07:32:32] cgoldberg: ychaouche, why are you using tabs anyways?
[2013-09-30 07:33:01] ychaouche: cgoldberg: I have to have two open tabs : one for retreving data from a website, and one for retreiving data from about:cache
[2013-09-30 07:33:08] cgoldberg: use 2 separate driver instances instead.. each controlling it's own window
[2013-09-30 07:33:34] cgoldberg: that's what i'd try..
[2013-09-30 07:33:35] ychaouche: cgoldberg: would that open two browsers with two different memories ?
[2013-09-30 07:34:12] cgoldberg: 2 browsers.. 1 cache (AFAIK)
[2013-09-30 07:34:28] ychaouche: not for in memory cache, unfortunately
[2013-09-30 07:34:37] ychaouche: it is instance specific.

[2013-09-30 07:39:00] ychaouche: I really don't know how to do it otherwise
[2013-09-30 07:39:07] cgoldberg: an http library
[2013-09-30 07:39:27] cgoldberg: also.. many streams are DRM'ed.. so capturing them will be no help
[2013-09-30 07:39:29] ychaouche: but you'd have to have the exact url, with ids, hidden variables etc.
[2013-09-30 07:39:35] cgoldberg: but for example a streamed mp3.. easy
[2013-09-30 07:39:38] ychaouche: cgoldberg: I did it manually it helped.

[2013-09-30 07:39:56] ychaouche: I'm listening to grooveshark atm
[2013-09-30 07:40:02] cgoldberg: so make an HTTP request for the mp3
[2013-09-30 07:40:17] ychaouche: cgoldberg: as I said, variables, specific urls, response etc...
[2013-09-30 07:40:22] ychaouche: too much work
[2013-09-30 07:40:38] ychaouche: and should grooveshark be aware you're using anything that's not like a browser, your IP is banned.
[2013-09-30 07:40:45] cgoldberg: ychaouche, all trivial compared to accessing browser cache via selenium while the stream is playing.. THAT's a hack
[2013-09-30 07:41:03] cgoldberg: ychaouche, spoof your user agent.. this is all simple stuff
[2013-09-30 07:41:25] cgoldberg: anyways.. good luck.. selenium is the wrong tool for the hob.. but have fun trying
[2013-09-30 07:41:43] ychaouche: cgoldberg: not really, you have to have a session, you must request a coin, you must mark a song as being downloaded after your do etc.
[2013-09-30 07:41:54] cgoldberg: and>
[2013-09-30 07:41:56] cgoldberg: ?
[2013-09-30 07:42:15] cgoldberg: sniff a browser session and recreate using python mechanize

[2013-09-30 07:43:10] ychaouche: cgoldberg: I already took a look at some existing tool, far from trivial.
[2013-09-30 07:43:19] cgoldberg: ychaouche, good luck to ya then

[2013-09-30 09:13:21] jimevans: jleyba: also, you solution won't work as-is for nested frames, will it? it'll require repeated calls to getWindow to navigate down the frame hierarchy to get to the correct window context, right?
[2013-09-30 09:13:51] jleyba: jimevans: https://gist.github.com/jleyba/6766198
[2013-09-30 09:14:25] jleyba: It depends on where you save your window reference.  It should work if you save window references in the top frame's cache

[2013-09-30 09:16:15] ychaouche: Hi back
[2013-09-30 09:16:34] ychaouche: Is there a way to tell if a link has been visited or not in webdriver ?
[2013-09-30 09:17:25] jleyba: ychaouche: no idea if this will work, but you could try   driver.findElements(By.cssSelector("a:visited"));
[2013-09-30 09:17:54] ychaouche: mm, actually I'm looping over a bunch of links I only want to process those that are not visited
[2013-09-30 09:18:05] ychaouche: your solution would require me to do a minus between two sets
[2013-09-30 09:18:26] Dave_B_: if your full links collection are in a list why not remove them when visited?
[2013-09-30 09:18:26] jleyba: are you using java?
[2013-09-30 09:18:39] ychaouche: I'll look at get_css_property maybe with :visited as argument or something

[2013-09-30 09:19:45] Dave_B_: if you need to make new list yopu could always pick at random from it and then check if visited, if so remove from list & pick again, else click and what have you
[2013-09-30 09:20:00] ychaouche: Dave_B_: or keep a cache

[2013-09-30 10:22:37] jleyba: for older versions of IE
[2013-09-30 10:22:43] jimevans: of course.
[2013-09-30 10:22:52] jleyba: otherwise looks fine
[2013-09-30 10:23:25] jleyba: might be worth opening up bot.inject.unwrapValue_ and have it take which document to unwrap element references in
[2013-09-30 10:23:35] jimevans: that should refactor out common code that can be reused for all of the other atoms. (getText, isEnabled, etc.)
[2013-09-30 10:23:39] jleyba: then just have it unwrap all the args instead of having the "first arg must be a element" constraint
[2013-09-30 10:24:03] jimevans: fair point
[2013-09-30 10:24:50] jimevans: i'll think about that.

[2013-09-30 13:15:56] jakubryska: brma: well the installation is OK, but the running of the chrome with output there is not working, it's on the centos
[2013-09-30 13:18:04] brma: jakubryska: the running part can be tougher.  I've found the easiest way to do it is to let xvfb manage which X session your using.
[2013-09-30 13:18:24] brma: jakubryska: I'm running on centos too.  this is my command:  xvfb-run --auto-servernum --server-args="-screen 0 1280x1024x24" <COMMAND>
[2013-09-30 13:18:48] brma: the <COMMAND> part would be starting the selenium server
[2013-09-30 13:20:08] brma: The only issue I've seen is that sometimes the chromedriver doesn't get killed properly (probably due to an aborted test run) whihc can leave a defunct Chrome process lying around

[2013-09-30 13:23:42] jimevans: jlebya: so the injected atom test for getSize() in dom_test.html is consistently failing in IE10.
[2013-09-30 13:23:44] brma: jakubryska: good luck.  I'd focus on getting it working because it's the best solution if you aren't going to run a grid with nodes that are real machines (IMO).
[2013-09-30 13:24:09] jimevans: jleyba: and i'm not sure what is exactly the right way to resolve the issue, so i'm looking for your insight.
[2013-09-30 13:24:56] jimevans: jleyba: the expected value is retrieved through goog.style.getSize(), which calls offsetWidth and offsetHeight, which are always integer values.
[2013-09-30 13:26:12] jimevans: jleyba: the actual getSize atom calls getBoundingClientRect, which returns floating point values in IE10.
[2013-09-30 13:26:29] jimevans: my confusion is, "which behavior is right?"

[2013-09-30 14:44:43] jimevans: i'm guessing i don't set that value, but i honestly don't know for sure.

[2013-09-30 14:46:36] jimevans: what i mean is that i don't know exactly how that value translates to the wininet proxy apis
[2013-09-30 14:49:04] nirvdrum: So, in the registry, I believe it's: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings -- ProxyOverride = '<local>'
[2013-09-30 14:49:21] nirvdrum: That's how I used to do it manually before IEDriver did it anyway.
[2013-09-30 14:49:28] nirvdrum: I'm not sure how that translates into the API call though :-/
[2013-09-30 14:49:37] jimevans: right, but writing directly to the registry is the Wrong Thing™ to do
[2013-09-30 14:49:52] nirvdrum: No disagreement here.

[2013-09-30 14:50:25] nirvdrum: Maybe the API allows an override list?  If so, it seems like that would auto-set the setting.
[2013-09-30 14:50:46] jimevans: nirvdrum: probably does. let me check.
[2013-09-30 14:51:12] nirvdrum: What was funky is "<local>" seems to be a magic value.

But any future use of that session doesn't seem to fail the same way that others do.  I'm not sure if the status code is just wrong, if there's a JSON payload that needs to be set, or if the remote web driver just isn't handling the response properly.

[2013-09-30 15:22:00] cgoldberg: lukeis, is it related to native events.. or should I file a bug for it?

[2013-09-30 15:22:37] lukeis: maybe… but it likely won't get worked on, since tabs aren't supported
[2013-09-30 15:22:54] lukeis: driver.execute_script("window.open('')") is your work around
[2013-09-30 15:23:22] cgoldberg: lukeis, i personally don't care much... but someone noticed it wasn't working.. so I wrote the testcase to prove
[2013-09-30 15:23:39] cgoldberg: might be good to just throw that testcase in the tracker for reference
[2013-09-30 15:23:47] lukeis: yeah, and the response from anyone in the selenium crowd is tabs are explicitly not supported :)
[2013-09-30 15:24:30] jleyba: lukeis: it's more nuanced than that.  tabs are the same as windows, and we just force everything to open in a new window
[2013-09-30 15:24:41] jleyba: I think I would actually prefer to go the other way and open everything in a new tab
[2013-09-30 15:24:55] cgoldberg: meh.. i'll just jump on the "tabs aren't supported" bandwagon and brush that bug under the rug

[2013-09-30 16:42:38] jimevans: okay, perl bindings then.

[2013-09-30 16:44:03] daemon: pita*
[2013-09-30 16:44:51] jimevans: the 204 is likely an HTTP status code being sent back by the selenium server.

[2013-09-30 16:45:18] daemon: it seems that if the remote command fails not inly does perl croak the selenium server axes the session

[2013-09-30 16:48:01] jimevans: actually, 204 is a success code.
[2013-09-30 16:48:11] daemon: its kinda the actual error is:

[2013-09-30 16:48:17] jimevans: 2xx is a success code for HTTP
[2013-09-30 16:48:43] jimevans: 204 responses must not return a body
[2013-09-30 16:48:53] jimevans: but can be considered a success.

[2013-09-30 16:55:49] memeyou: imevans - I only see javaw.exe, is that it?
[2013-09-30 16:55:50] jimevans: daemon: it's not an error.
[2013-09-30 16:55:52] jimevans: full stop
[2013-09-30 16:56:05] Eravohnn: OK! So.. My code clicks the "Follow" button on a random Twitch profile (It actually does click it) and the text changes from Follow to Following. But When I open a browser and go to my page - that person is not in my "following" list.. wth? It's like its not.. saved..
[2013-09-30 16:56:28] daemon: jimevans, I think when I soft returned the cannot find ..... perl has remembered the failure from the last attempt to find something and is returning that instead for the next query
[2013-09-30 16:56:37] daemon: but I do not see where its stashing it
[2013-09-30 16:56:47] jimevans: except for the getTitle command (which you've not dumped the output to), all of the commands subsequent to the failed findElement return an empty result (204).

[2013-09-30 17:18:23] javalover: guys how do I do this twice? //descendant::div[contains(@class, 'myclass')][${i}]
[2013-09-30 17:18:37] javalover: I want to get a div that is inside the div that this finds
[2013-09-30 17:19:15] irene-knapp: you add /div to the end of it
[2013-09-30 17:19:24] irene-knapp: that's why it's called a path - you can keep adding components to it
[2013-09-30 17:20:13] javalover: so wait //descendant::div[contains(@class, 'event-pop')][${i}] /div[contains?
[2013-09-30 17:20:15] javalover: like that?
[2013-09-30 17:20:38] irene-knapp: well, possibly you want to explicitly specify the descendant axis,
[2013-09-30 17:20:50] irene-knapp: and I think that //descendant:: doesn't mean what you want it to, you probably mean /descendant::
[2013-09-30 17:21:45] irene-knapp: argh
[2013-09-30 17:21:51] irene-knapp: I keep typing things out and they start with a / so I can't send them
[2013-09-30 17:22:00] irene-knapp:  // is an abbreviation for /descendant::node()/
[2013-09-30 17:22:18] irene-knapp: so //descendant::div expands to /descentant::node()/descendant::div
[2013-09-30 17:22:29] irene-knapp: which probably isn't what you thought it was, although it COULD be

[2013-09-30 17:22:56] javalover: yeah i'm new to all of this
[2013-09-30 17:22:59] irene-knapp: if you add /div[... at the end of the thing you gave above, that will look for an immediate child and not an ultimate child
[2013-09-30 17:23:14] irene-knapp: when in doubt, check the xpath spec on the w3 site, or ask stackoverflow, or I bet there's an #xpath here :)
[2013-09-30 17:23:23] javalover: wait but
[2013-09-30 17:23:24] irene-knapp: we are not really an xpath channel, I just happened to be messing with this earlier today
[2013-09-30 17:23:29] irene-knapp: sure?

[2013-09-30 17:24:08] javalover: so you're saying it just continues?
[2013-09-30 17:24:19] irene-knapp: yeah, you can just keep adding more clauses to it, with / between them
[2013-09-30 17:24:35] javalover: odd I did try that and it didn't work but maybe it's the //
[2013-09-30 17:24:40] irene-knapp: very likely :)
[2013-09-30 17:24:48] javalover: I also did /descendent
[2013-09-30 17:24:51] javalover: maybe i should just do /div
[2013-09-30 17:24:56] irene-knapp: well, it needs the :: after descendant
[2013-09-30 17:25:04] irene-knapp: like /descendant::div at the end of it

[2013-09-30 17:26:05] javalover: the contains part?
[2013-09-30 17:26:16] irene-knapp: yeah
[2013-09-30 17:26:21] irene-knapp: mind you, you need that ] matching the [
[2013-09-30 17:26:27] irene-knapp: well
[2013-09-30 17:26:29] irene-knapp: I forget the syntax :)
[2013-09-30 17:26:35] irene-knapp: I could look it up, but then, so could you :)
[2013-09-30 17:26:54] javalover: well the thing is
[2013-09-30 17:26:56] javalover: the first one works
[2013-09-30 17:26:58] irene-knapp: but yes, xpath can do that, it's one of the biggest things xpath has that css selectors don't
[2013-09-30 17:27:02] javalover: but when I try to do it again it fails
[2013-09-30 17:27:16] irene-knapp: what you're asking now is how you can select a div that contains another div satisfying certain properties, right?
[2013-09-30 17:27:16] javalover: sooo //descendant::div[contains(@class, 'event-pop')][${i}]   that works
[2013-09-30 17:27:21] irene-knapp: selecting the outer one
[2013-09-30 17:27:34] javalover: i'm trying to select an inner div

[2013-09-30 17:27:43] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-30 17:27:45] irene-knapp: sorry, yes, I misunderstood because I had forgotten the original example
[2013-09-30 17:27:56] irene-knapp: strictly, what I use instead of contains(@class, 'event-pop') is...
[2013-09-30 17:28:23] irene-knapp: contains(concat(' ', normalize-space(@class), ' '), ' event-pop ')
[2013-09-30 17:28:26] irene-knapp: see what that's doing?

[2013-09-30 17:29:21] stephend, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-30 17:29:27] irene-knapp: so yeah
[2013-09-30 17:29:43] irene-knapp: the inner div, you want it immediately within,
[2013-09-30 17:29:46] irene-knapp: or anywhere within?
[2013-09-30 17:30:06] javalover: anywhere within
[2013-09-30 17:30:15] irene-knapp: and you know what the [${i}] is doing, right?  selecting the i-th child of the div that has event-pop?
[2013-09-30 17:30:20] javalover: of course i wouldn't mind having a "next node" command
[2013-09-30 17:30:25] irene-knapp: right, there is one, actually
[2013-09-30 17:30:30] javalover: yeah it's a loop

[2013-09-30 17:30:50] irene-knapp: the part between the slash and the :: is called the "axis" and it describes a way in which you can traverse the document, such as forwards, backwards, in, out, etc
[2013-09-30 17:31:01] javalover: dang
[2013-09-30 17:31:02] irene-knapp: yeah
[2013-09-30 17:31:12] irene-knapp: I'm just full of information!
[2013-09-30 17:31:44] javalover: i'm so new to all of this  I didn't even know it existed
[2013-09-30 17:31:55] irene-knapp: that's fine!
[2013-09-30 17:32:26] irene-knapp: this is called an xpath thingy, and it's a standard (well, sort of standard... the wonderful thing about standards, as they say, is that there are so many to choose from...) for describing how to get from one place to another in a website :)
[2013-09-30 17:32:46] p_l: well, it's a standard for XML
[2013-09-30 17:32:57] javalover: is that where it comes from p_l?
[2013-09-30 17:33:06] p_l: I found personally that CSS makes for better approach on websites
[2013-09-30 17:33:11] p_l: javalover: that's what it is defined for
[2013-09-30 17:33:23] javalover: it' sodd you'd say that cuz also in my code I have htis
[2013-09-30 17:33:25] javalover: this*
[2013-09-30 17:33:26] p_l: it just happens that HTML through pains etc. ended up supporting same DOM

[2013-09-30 17:33:35] irene-knapp: lol
[2013-09-30 17:33:46] javalover: css=div.myclass
[2013-09-30 17:33:54] p_l: not that Xpath is bad per se
[2013-09-30 17:33:56] javalover: so I do that first & then I use the other thing to interact with it
[2013-09-30 17:34:07] javalover: coruse this is code i'm using from a stack overflow
[2013-09-30 17:34:09] irene-knapp: yeah, they both serve purposes.  css is more concise for common tasks, but also more restricted.
[2013-09-30 17:34:15] irene-knapp: certainly
[2013-09-30 17:34:43] p_l: in my one real work selenium project, I started with xpath, and after flailing around switched to CSS with occasional executeScript with jQuery :)
[2013-09-30 17:34:57] javalover: well I think I get this but when I try it fails
[2013-09-30 17:35:43] javalover: wait maybe i have wrong class
[2013-09-30 17:35:44] irene-knapp: what's the full path as you have it now, javalover?
[2013-09-30 17:35:45] javalover: now that I think about it
[2013-09-30 17:36:42] javalover: was gonna try this //descendant::div[contains(@class, 'event-pop')][${i}] /div[contains(@class, 'title')]@id
[2013-09-30 17:37:50] irene-knapp: ah, yes, I think that's valid
[2013-09-30 17:38:13] irene-knapp: what does it do?  appear to succeed but with no results?
[2013-09-30 17:39:01] javalover: yeah
[2013-09-30 17:39:06] javalover: it might be that i have to do each one individually
[2013-09-30 17:39:12] javalover: so imma try that
[2013-09-30 17:39:36] irene-knapp: okay
[2013-09-30 17:39:46] javalover: yeah i was right
[2013-09-30 17:39:49] javalover: it works if i go to next div
[2013-09-30 17:39:54] javalover: now comes my question //descendant
[2013-09-30 17:39:59] javalover: that seems like it's saying "is inside"
[2013-09-30 17:40:05] javalover: but when I try that it fails...
[2013-09-30 17:40:14] javalover: however I can solve from here just doing each one individually
[2013-09-30 17:40:36] javalover: WAIT
[2013-09-30 17:40:38] javalover: i figured it out
[2013-09-30 17:40:40] javalover: the title has no ID
[2013-09-30 17:40:41] irene-knapp: do tell
[2013-09-30 17:40:41] javalover: lol
[2013-09-30 17:40:47] irene-knapp: ah!  okay lol
[2013-09-30 17:40:50] javalover: so of course the value is blank
[2013-09-30 17:40:50] javalover: hahaha
[2013-09-30 17:42:14] irene-knapp: as I like to say
[2013-09-30 17:42:17] irene-knapp: it's always something simple
[2013-09-30 17:42:23] irene-knapp: the question is always just, which simple thing is it
[2013-09-30 17:42:55] javalover: yeah this one is more cuz i didn't know how it worked
[2013-09-30 17:43:02] javalover: so given an hour of "well it does work like this" i was able to see it
[2013-09-30 17:43:09] irene-knapp: hehe :)
[2013-09-30 17:43:11] irene-knapp: no problem!
[2013-09-30 17:43:18] javalover: now I know @id gives me the id
[2013-09-30 17:43:24] javalover: does @text give me the text?
[2013-09-30 17:43:33] irene-knapp: I'm not sure, but I don't think so
[2013-09-30 17:43:38] javalover: k i google that
[2013-09-30 17:43:39] irene-knapp: the @ is a syntax for getting an attribute value
[2013-09-30 17:43:42] javalover: you've been a great help
