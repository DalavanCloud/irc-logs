[2013-09-16 00:21:50] firc: ddary: thanks
[2013-09-16 00:21:55] firc: I'm new to using selenium. I'm using the pyvirtualdisplay (xvfb) and trying to do something very basic. Open a webpage and save a screenshot
[2013-09-16 00:22:00] firc: whenever I call driver.save_screenshot(file_name) the command seems to hang there, forever.
[2013-09-16 00:22:03] firc: Is there a way, I can see what exactly is going wrong?
[2013-09-16 00:23:35] ddary: I'm not an python expert, but when the browser is started, is it started in the virtual display?
[2013-09-16 00:24:46] andreastt: firc: Does it work without the virtual display?
[2013-09-16 00:25:04] andreastt: firc: I think what you want to do is to connect to the virtual display and verify that the browser is behaving as it should.
[2013-09-16 00:25:06] firc: I'm trying this on a server. I don't have X
[2013-09-16 00:25:15] firc: how would I do that?
[2013-09-16 00:25:26] andreastt: Connect to the X display server?
[2013-09-16 00:25:32] ddary: that is probably the issue

[2013-09-16 00:30:44] andreastt: firc: You should be able to remotely connect to an X display over VNC with a program like x11vnc IIRC.

[2013-09-16 00:31:14] andreastt: Or you can tell Xauthorities to allow you to do it natively in X, but that's kind of old fashioned.

[2013-09-16 00:34:28] andreastt: Maybe try a different browser?

[2013-09-16 09:16:06] phasze: jimevans: sounds good

[2013-09-16 09:21:01] jimevans: yeah, new events are cheap. i'm going to implement it that way.
[2013-09-16 09:21:05] phasze: what about adding it to WebElementEventArgs?
[2013-09-16 09:21:36] jimevans: phasze: then you have an ElementValue property that only has meaning for one method, when sending keys.
[2013-09-16 09:21:53] jimevans: and that's inelegant, and poor api design/.
[2013-09-16 09:21:53] dawagner, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-16 09:22:41] phasze: hmm, true true.  Since the other events don't really have multiple methods firing them.
[2013-09-16 09:23:36] jimevans: what's the use case that you need to distinguish between the two?

[2013-09-16 09:25:19] Prometheian: If I'm creating a new Capabilities for Chrome, what do I pass to it to tell it to not run in sandbox mode?
[2013-09-16 09:25:29] jimevans: Prometheian: what do you mean?
[2013-09-16 09:25:44] jimevans: what would you pass on chrome's command line to make that work?
[2013-09-16 09:26:24] Prometheian: sec, I have that in a tab
[2013-09-16 09:26:30] Prometheian: in java
[2013-09-16 09:26:37] Prometheian: how would I pass it to it
[2013-09-16 09:26:51] Prometheian: "--no-sandbox"
[2013-09-16 09:27:16] jleyba: Prometheian: You need to make sure the CHROME_DEVEL_SANDBOX environment variable is set (and empty)
[2013-09-16 09:27:34] jleyba: I believe that will stop working in Chrome 30 though
[2013-09-16 09:27:35] Prometheian: Capabilities temp = new Capabilities();
[2013-09-16 09:28:02] jimevans: Prometheian: i'd assume you'd call addArguments("--no-sandbox") using the ChromeOptions class.
[2013-09-16 09:28:02] Prometheian: Would I put it in there?
[2013-09-16 09:28:58] Prometheian: kk

[2013-09-16 09:30:04] Prometheian: Says unsupported command line flag, stability and security will suffer.. Does that mean it won't won't affect anything, or that it's a legacy command?
[2013-09-16 09:30:32] phasze: jimevans: Some of my testers have written tests that will attempt to clear a field before typing in it, this presents problems with input file fields since you cannot clear them and throws a js error in IE (and probably other browsers).  I would like to eventually turn on script error reporting in IE, so tests fail if they happen, and I was hoping to only have that Clear() function complete if the element wasn't for input files but still have the sendkeys c
[2013-09-16 09:30:34] jimevans: Prometheian: it's telling you "don't use this"
[2013-09-16 09:30:45] Prometheian: kk ^^
[2013-09-16 09:30:49] phasze: Kind of a hack way around it but that way or making my own webelement was my other idea
[2013-09-16 09:30:58] phasze: or just changing all of the tests
[2013-09-16 09:31:30] timbo1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-16 09:32:04] jimevans: phasze: are your testers calling .Clear() and .SendKeys directly, or are they using a wrapping library?
[2013-09-16 09:32:22] phasze: I'm making the wrapping library now, for now they're calling them directly
[2013-09-16 09:33:13] jimevans: in the wrapping library, you can check for that. bool isFileElement = element.GetAttribute("type") == "file";
[2013-09-16 09:33:15] phasze: while making the library is where I came up with the idea to catch it in ElementValueChanging
[2013-09-16 09:33:42] phasze: yes, but how to distinguish between Clear() and sendKeys()?
[2013-09-16 09:33:49] qaguy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-09-16 09:34:00] jimevans: in the wrapping library, you don't need to.
[2013-09-16 09:35:04] phasze: wait, why not?  How would I block the Clear() command when it's of type file if I cannot distinguish between Clear and sendKeys?
[2013-09-16 09:35:18] phasze: ah
[2013-09-16 09:35:19] phasze: nvm
[2013-09-16 09:35:34] phasze: well, I guess I could overwrite Clear()
[2013-09-16 09:35:46] phasze: which is essentially what I have done

[2013-09-16 12:25:03] jleyba: why not?  you demonstrated you can inject the scripts to set it up

[2013-09-16 12:25:32] jimevans: yes, but you need a *way* to inject the scripts.
[2013-09-16 12:25:50] jimevans: if you want to start bundling a proxy with webdriver, that's fine, but that's what it would take.

[2013-09-16 12:30:09] jleyba: jimevans: I don't follow.  implementations that can handle multiple domains now would be just fine
[2013-09-16 12:30:18] jleyba: implementations that are bound by same origin still will be bound by same origin
[2013-09-16 12:30:31] jleyba: I don't see where the proxy is required
[2013-09-16 12:31:43] jimevans: wait, we're talking about capturing javascript errors, right? there's no way to do that for onload events without using a proxy.
[2013-09-16 12:32:15] jimevans: you've got to inject your onerror routine to be the *first* thing that happens on the page.
[2013-09-16 12:33:20] jleyba: jimevans: you're getting stuck in IE driver implementation details
[2013-09-16 12:33:43] jleyba: Safari, Chrome, and Firefox can all inject scripts before onload fires
[2013-09-16 12:34:16] jimevans: well, sort of, because any solution that doesn't include feasibility in IE relegates IE to second-class citizenship, and i'll resist that with every fiber of my being.
[2013-09-16 12:34:47] jleyba: I see this along the lines of alert handling and screenshots
[2013-09-16 12:35:09] jleyba: a) not every driver will be able to capture js errors - it will be off by default and encoded in capabilities if it's supported
[2013-09-16 12:35:18] jleyba: b) not every driver will be able to provide the same fidelity of error reporting
[2013-09-16 12:35:41] jimevans: so hide it behind an interface. let's do the same for status codes then, and get everyone to stfu about issue 141.
[2013-09-16 12:36:06] jimevans: you can't have it both ways.
[2013-09-16 12:36:40] jleyba: Actually, yes, I can
[2013-09-16 12:36:48] jleyba: There's lots of precedence in existing features

[2013-09-16 12:41:35] zeljkof, quitting. (Quit: zeljkof)
[2013-09-16 12:41:38] jleyba: if you click a button and the event handler throws, there may be no indication why subsequent action fails
[2013-09-16 12:42:07] jleyba: the test would likely end up with an explicit wait timeout or something
[2013-09-16 12:42:35] jleyba: the javascript may already be on the page - webdriver would just be hooking in and providing that feedback
[2013-09-16 12:44:25] jleyba: also, javascript errors are within the realm of the rendered DOM

[2013-09-16 12:45:55] barancev|2: page load timeouts are at the network layer too
[2013-09-16 12:46:18] jleyba: not necessarily
[2013-09-16 12:46:52] dimacus: jleyba:  when you are dumping the defualt log, driver log, etcâ€¦ doesn't that dump the JS console and JS errors in there?
[2013-09-16 12:47:27] jleyba: dimacus: this about providing more immediate feedback than "oh crap my test failed, let me go dig through 10k of log output"
[2013-09-16 12:47:40] dimacus: touche
[2013-09-16 12:48:24] jleyba: barancev|2: page load timeout can be implemented in terms of window.onload or DOMContentLoaded.
[2013-09-16 12:48:42] jleyba: in fact, it is defined within terms of DOM state. not network activity
[2013-09-16 12:48:43] dimacus: what if taking the aproach outside of a webdriver? like an FF or Chrome plugin that collects it and makes it available via execute_script?

[2013-09-16 12:50:11] jimevans: jleyba: didn't propose. developed. and only because there's not a built-in solution.
[2013-09-16 12:50:25] jimevans: for the record, i'd rather have a native built-in solution too.
[2013-09-16 12:50:48] jimevans: but you can't get there from here in the one browser i'm responsible for wrangling into the webdriver world.

[2013-09-16 13:02:04] AutomatedTester: dimacus: overload onerror on the browser and you can do what you want...
[2013-09-16 13:02:22] dimacus: does it work across all browsers?
[2013-09-16 13:02:26] dimacus: IE etc...
[2013-09-16 13:03:42] AutomatedTester: its in IE
[2013-09-16 13:03:55] AutomatedTester: dont know what version it came in but its a fairly standard thing
[2013-09-16 13:04:04] jimevans: dimacus: it works in IE. that's the whole premise of my blog post. that by injecting a script into the page (as the *first* script executing on the page), you can gather all errors, even those in the onload event.
[2013-09-16 13:04:22] jimevans: and i have demonstration code that has it working in IE, firefox, and chrome.

[2013-09-16 13:05:32] AutomatedTester: and see if there are any bad CDN pushes
[2013-09-16 13:05:39] dimacus: is it wrong to automatically start injecting this for all browsers and dump into /tmp of some sortâ€¦
[2013-09-16 13:06:08] jimevans: dimacus: that depends on what your goal is.
[2013-09-16 13:06:10] dimacus: then you don't really need to integrate error reading into webdriver per seâ€¦ unless the browsers is on remote moachine
[2013-09-16 13:06:45] dimacus: jimevans:  simple access to all JS errorsâ€¦ at the end of test run JS errors count should be 0 or fail the test
[2013-09-16 13:06:48] jimevans: if you don't care about potential onload js errors, feel free to do exactly that.
[2013-09-16 13:07:54] dimacus: that does solve my issues
[2013-09-16 13:08:25] santiycr, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-09-16 13:09:23] jimevans: that's always been the "go-to" answer for how to do it. inject a script that hooks onerror, and go from there. the problem with it is when your errors occur during the onload event. your injected script won't catch them (under ordinary circumstances)

[2013-09-16 13:59:07] jimevans: mindsailor: phantomjs is not chrome. it's a headless webkit implementation. every webkit implementation is slightly different.
[2013-09-16 13:59:09] Dude-X: so it will probably resemble Safari more now than chrome
[2013-09-16 13:59:42] mindsailor: ah okay.
[2013-09-16 14:00:16] Dude-X: btw the example xpath you gave is very brittle, it should be generic
[2013-09-16 14:00:26] mindsailor: Is there any alternative?  the xpath goes through it just doesn't open the pop up box like it should and does in firefox.

[2013-09-16 14:33:15] Prometheian: Because the window closes and it disconnects...?

[2013-09-16 16:37:14] firc: Hi all. I'm facing some issue using selenium
[2013-09-16 16:37:39] firc: I'm using the firefox driver, and apparently when i call driver.get(url) it works for some pages
[2013-09-16 16:38:01] firc: I have a javascript heavy page, and when I call driver.get(url) on that, it seems to hang there.
[2013-09-16 16:38:09] firc: is there a way to debug that?
[2013-09-16 16:38:46] nirvdrum: Is the browser locked up?  You might be getting an unresponsive page error.
[2013-09-16 16:38:49] plightbo_work, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-09-16 16:39:18] firc: maybe, because after calling driver.get(url) i try a browser.page_source
[2013-09-16 16:39:22] firc: it even hangs tehre

[2013-09-16 16:39:39] firc: oh, and i'm running the test on a server box, using pyvirtualdriver (xvfb)
[2013-09-16 16:39:57] firc: no X..
[2013-09-16 16:40:39] firc: The page is just javascript heavy. There isn't any problem as such with the scripts
[2013-09-16 16:41:00] nirvdrum: I mean, seeing what the browser is doing is a good way to debug.
[2013-09-16 16:41:10] nirvdrum: Presumably you have a desktop you could try this on.
[2013-09-16 16:41:33] firc: well. lemme try

[2013-09-16 16:49:38] firc: nirvdrum: ok, weird thing. When I tried it on my local box, the page in question opened up fine, and it didn't hang.
[2013-09-16 16:50:04] firc: http://pastie.org/8331426#15   line 40, 45, 46, etc don't work.
[2013-09-16 16:50:36] firc: I tried pdb, and it seems the script hangs at data = self._sock.recv(self._rbufsize).. so yes, something is unresponsive.
[2013-09-16 16:52:07] firc: is it because I'm using xvfb?
[2013-09-16 16:53:18] nirvdrum: My guess is the machine you're normally testing against is slower.

[2013-09-16 16:55:04] nirvdrum: Or run vnc.
[2013-09-16 16:55:10] nirvdrum: Just to see what's going on.
[2013-09-16 16:55:15] firc: how do I do that?
[2013-09-16 16:55:43] firc: if I dont have X, can I still see whats going on?
[2013-09-16 16:55:56] firc: can I take a screenshot of the xvfb session?
[2013-09-16 17:03:07] firc: hmm, got it.
[2013-09-16 17:03:19] firc: Ok, I can see that the browser shows that it's loading
