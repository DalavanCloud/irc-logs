[2013-09-13 02:29:03] AutomatedTester: manoj9788: what do you think would prevent it?
[2013-09-13 02:29:36] AutomatedTester: at worst its browsers that wouldnt work but I doubt they would be an issue
[2013-09-13 02:30:56] manoj9788: I get to see the browsers working, i am able to use Firefox browser
[2013-09-13 02:31:28] manoj9788: I guess it might get issues when it deals with the native events. And believe it would be slow in running.

[2013-09-13 07:48:05] lrvick: Like, is being abel to load a url that is bound to a driver even possible with selenium?

[2013-09-13 07:48:42] lrvick: Or is that evne soemthing a driver could potentially do, even if it does not exist todaY?
[2013-09-13 07:49:40] jimevans: Irvick: i'm not entirely sure what you're asking for. it sounds like you want to drive mobile browsers that drivers don't exist for (like kindle fire, nook, and so on)
[2013-09-13 07:52:25] lrvick: Correct. Basically be able to drive the browser using generic javascript
[2013-09-13 07:52:57] cgoldberg, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-13 07:53:21] lrvick: plug in a special selenium url into the browser that injects javascript automation commands and does it's thing
[2013-09-13 07:54:00] jimevans: Irvick: i don't know how you'd get around the javascript sandbox.
[2013-09-13 07:54:23] jimevans: you need to have a way to execute script from within the context of the existing page.
[2013-09-13 07:54:27] jimevans: full stop.
[2013-09-13 07:54:37] jimevans: otherwise you'll run into cross-domain scripting issues.
[2013-09-13 07:54:55] lrvick: Yeah i mean selenium is acting as  broxy anyway, yeah?
[2013-09-13 07:55:05] lrvick: so it could just inject scripts into the page before the browser loads it
[2013-09-13 07:55:10] jimevans: depends on how you run it.
[2013-09-13 07:55:11] lrvick: which i assume it does to some extent anyway
[2013-09-13 07:55:15] jimevans: if you're talking about webdriver, no
[2013-09-13 07:55:19] jimevans: it doesn't act as a proxy
[2013-09-13 07:55:37] jimevans: if you're talking about the obsolete selenium rc, the answer is "maybe"
[2013-09-13 07:55:45] lrvick: Ok fair enough.
[2013-09-13 07:56:32] jimevans: in webdriver, browser drivers are tightly bound to the browsers they automate.
[2013-09-13 07:56:32] lrvick: Well then this would need to be a driver, that injects your tests into the page as JS, and then rather than _real_ touch events etc, it will fire onclick handlers for click, emulate keyboard input etc
[2013-09-13 07:56:41] lrvick: everything should be pssible with pure JS on the page

[2013-09-13 07:57:01] jimevans: agreed. in fact that's exactly how some drivers work today.
[2013-09-13 07:57:25] jimevans: the hard part, as i'm sure you're beginning to understand, is having the ability to inject the javascript.
[2013-09-13 07:57:37] jimevans: s/inject/inject and execute/
[2013-09-13 07:57:40] lrvick: That part, is actually easy. I have written multipel toosl to do this
[2013-09-13 07:58:18] jimevans: from an application that you have no control over the source code? without resorting to frames?
[2013-09-13 07:58:31] lrvick: sure
[2013-09-13 07:58:35] jimevans: s/an application/a website/

[2013-09-13 08:05:32] lrvick: very easy to do. So I don't see why it should not be possible to make a generic selenium driver that proxies and just outputs a url, and can be run on any device that for whatever reason a traditional driver is not possible for.

[2013-09-13 08:09:29] jimevans: as i said, might be an interesting approach. sounds like a step backward in my opinion (no native events), but knock yourself out. of course, you still need a way to force the browser to browser to your url.
[2013-09-13 08:09:50] lrvick: Again this is a step backwards, but the only option for some devices

[2013-09-13 08:10:36] lrvick: As far as making the browser browser to a certian url, I can remote control that over websockets.
[2013-09-13 08:10:38] jimevans: which you could manually, if you intend on actually hard-coding your tests into your mitm.
[2013-09-13 08:10:40] lrvick: and push anew url to it
[2013-09-13 08:10:57] jimevans: you still have a bootstrapping problem.
[2013-09-13 08:11:02] lrvick: the script i inject can inso include a listener, that the driver uses to push new urls to it
[2013-09-13 08:11:21] jimevans: that's pretty much how the desktop safari driver works today.
[2013-09-13 08:11:24] pairup, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-13 08:11:42] jimevans: but you can launch desktop safari, forcing it to use an existing url.

[2013-09-13 08:12:14] lrvick: Yeah in this case I would set the home page of each device to a script that has aa websocket connection to the driver and waits for instructions
[2013-09-13 08:12:17] Ardesco: oh jimevans it was me being stupid with the chrome options
[2013-09-13 08:12:17] Ardesco: it works fine if you pass in an array properly
[2013-09-13 08:12:17] Ardesco: instead of trying to pass in the contents of an array
[2013-09-13 08:12:17] Ardesco: :)
[2013-09-13 08:12:26] jimevans: heh.
[2013-09-13 08:12:27] lrvick: so on all my obscure devices that dont have native drivers i load up this special url
[2013-09-13 08:12:28] Ardesco: lesson = don't try and do shit like that last thing on a Friday
[2013-09-13 08:12:30] Ardesco: ;)
[2013-09-13 08:12:37] lrvick: then the driver can run tests on them whenever
[2013-09-13 08:13:28] jimevans: Irvick: assuming, of course, that the mobile browser supports websockets. (does IE on windows phone? i honestly don't know)
[2013-09-13 08:13:36] lrvick: jimevans: Then we can have a universal catch all driver for about the 10 devices right now I have that i can't use selenium on in any capacity today.
[2013-09-13 08:13:48] lrvick: jimevans: I would use sockjs which falls back all the way to ie5.5 and works on every target device
[2013-09-13 08:13:49] lrvick: ive tested
[2013-09-13 08:14:05] lrvick: it alls back to evne json polling, if it has to
[2013-09-13 08:14:10] lrvick: or xhr streaming
[2013-09-13 08:14:25] jimevans: sounds like it might be an interesting project.
[2013-09-13 08:14:29] lrvick: but it is api compatible with websockets.

[2013-09-13 11:00:01] figuringout: hi, i'm trying to get data out of a page that loads content via javascript. i am able to use page_source to get the HTML, but this page does not containt the elements that I want. They seem to be loaded dynamically in some way, dont even show up when I do "view source" in Firefox.
[2013-09-13 11:00:03] figuringout: any pointers?
[2013-09-13 11:01:15] jimevans: figuringout: don't try to analyze the html source. find the elements you want and extract the data from them.
[2013-09-13 11:01:27] lukeis: maybe they're in a frame?
[2013-09-13 11:01:46] figuringout: they are, i think
[2013-09-13 11:02:14] lukeis: then you have to switchTo that frame  (and in firefox, right click, this frame -> view frame source)
[2013-09-13 11:02:17] figuringout: i also tried driver.find_element_by_css_selector (and had a huge time.sleep before i called it) and that also fails
[2013-09-13 11:02:40] lukeis: driver.switch_to(driver.find_element_by_tag_name('iframe'))  first
[2013-09-13 11:02:55] lukeis: (or a better locator for your frame)
[2013-09-13 11:03:12] figuringout: how should i check if its a different frame? when i right click in firefox, i dont see "see frame source"
[2013-09-13 11:03:15] lukeis: driver.switch_to_frame*
[2013-09-13 11:03:41] lukeis: use the inspector, easier to use than viewing page source

[2013-09-13 11:12:51] lukeis: do you work for google?
[2013-09-13 11:13:08] Dude-X: oh my god you're trying to automate against a google website?
[2013-09-13 11:13:13] figuringout: nope, just a class project.
[2013-09-13 11:13:22] lukeis: ok, choose something else ;)
[2013-09-13 11:13:31] figuringout: i'm at MIT -- so foolhardy?
[2013-09-13 11:13:42] Dude-X: it's even foolhardy for google themselves
[2013-09-13 11:13:48] lukeis: google is best left to be automated by google ;)
[2013-09-13 11:14:13] figuringout: ah, so you think something's going on, that is going to be very very hard to solve? not selenium's fault?
[2013-09-13 11:14:21] lukeis: yes
[2013-09-13 11:14:31] figuringout: sigh
[2013-09-13 11:14:35] Dude-X: on top of that, google uses code generators to write the site
[2013-09-13 11:14:45] Dude-X: so those code generators can change something the next day
[2013-09-13 11:14:55] lukeis: google's pages use very complex javascript with frames and other 'tricks' / hacks to get things rendered the way they do
[2013-09-13 11:15:37] figuringout: my sense was, "if i can see it, i can grab it" -- not true for google's pages?

[2013-09-13 11:18:04] lukeis: what are you trying to accomplish?
[2013-09-13 11:18:27] lukeis: like a cool demo of selenium automation?
[2013-09-13 11:18:27] figuringout: i'm trying to figure out when a particular listing was added / changed
[2013-09-13 11:18:36] figuringout: economics class project
[2013-09-13 11:18:53] figuringout: mapmaker is like wikipedia, so in theory you can look at edits and figure that out
[2013-09-13 11:18:59] lukeis: ah, I would look into any API google has exposed and leave selenium out of it ;)
[2013-09-13 11:19:08] jimevans: +1
[2013-09-13 11:19:18] figuringout: unfortunately no API for this, i've looked :(
[2013-09-13 11:20:36] mdas, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-13 11:21:09] lukeis: yeah, they probably don't like people mining their data in this way
[2013-09-13 11:21:54] figuringout: i think that should be, they "definitely" dont like people mining their data in this way ;/
[2013-09-13 11:22:12] phasze: if you mine it then they can't sell it ;)
[2013-09-13 11:22:45] figuringout: anyone want to make a guess as to how they're hiding the data?
[2013-09-13 11:23:19] Dude-X: it doesn't matter how they're hiding it, it will probably change next week
[2013-09-13 11:23:59] figuringout: yeah, but i'll be all done by then :)
[2013-09-13 11:24:03] phasze: figuringout: you'll probably have to navigate into randomly generated frames
[2013-09-13 11:24:11] phasze: to get the info you want
[2013-09-13 11:24:20] figuringout: ok, thanks for the tip
[2013-09-13 11:24:39] vila, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-09-13 11:24:58] phasze: and since for now they probably won't change it "too" soon you could do it by frame indexes
[2013-09-13 11:25:23] figuringout: how can i figure out what frame it is in?
[2013-09-13 11:25:28] figuringout: firebug?
[2013-09-13 11:25:29] lukeis: it's not in a frame
[2013-09-13 11:25:37] lukeis: firebug would tell ya
[2013-09-13 11:25:44] phasze: yeah, firebug is key
[2013-09-13 11:25:45] figuringout: right, that was my hunch also
[2013-09-13 11:25:47] lukeis: i use chrome + it's built in inspector
[2013-09-13 11:25:58] phasze: I also prefer chrome
[2013-09-13 11:26:03] phasze: just seems to go faster
[2013-09-13 11:26:17] figuringout: yeah, firebug's being a real drag for me too
[2013-09-13 11:26:21] lukeis: (firefox also has a built in inspector)
[2013-09-13 11:26:41] lukeis: and firefox has been performing as good if not better than chrome lately
[2013-09-13 11:26:52] phasze: ooo
[2013-09-13 11:26:58] phasze: maybe I'll have to update and try it out
[2013-09-13 11:27:59] phasze: if FF just updated without telling me like chrome does I would update FF more :P

[2013-09-13 11:29:34] figuringout: one of the things i'm doing is find_element_by_link to click on some of these links, and that works fine -- is it normal to expect issues only when i'm trying to dump the data somewhere?
[2013-09-13 11:29:44] lukeis: phasze: i think it does now

[2013-09-13 11:30:56] lukeis: figuringout: normal? i don't think so… it's normal to need to add waits after clicking though
[2013-09-13 11:31:21] lukeis: WebDriverWait and ExpectedConditions are your friend :)
[2013-09-13 11:31:57] phasze: your friend which turns out you can't live without so she becomes a dependency like a drug you can't get rid of and stuck with for life paying for all her dirty habits
[2013-09-13 11:32:07] phasze: errrr, I mean yes, your good friend
[2013-09-13 11:32:20] figuringout: yeah, but one would think a time.sleep(30) should be sufficient?

[2013-09-13 11:37:22] jimevans: if you're using the raw webdriver methods in your tests, You're Doing It Wrong.

[2013-09-13 11:37:45] phasze: what do you mean?
[2013-09-13 11:37:59] jimevans: you should already have wrappers built for the functionality you need.
[2013-09-13 11:38:28] lukeis: you forgot the ™  ;)   You're Doing it Wrong.™
[2013-09-13 11:38:32] jimevans: webdriver is much more of a building block for other frameworks than something to be used raw.
[2013-09-13 11:38:48] phasze: but is there a way to wrap multiple things in one?
[2013-09-13 11:38:53] jimevans: it can be done, but you'll run into situations like this.
[2013-09-13 11:39:04] jimevans: yeah, it's called a wrapper method.
[2013-09-13 11:39:05] jimevans: :)
[2013-09-13 11:39:19] *phasze googles'
[2013-09-13 11:39:33] jimevans: no, i mean you wrap the calls to webdriver with methods of your own design.,
[2013-09-13 11:40:08] jimevans: that way you can do what you need to do before calling the base webdriver method.
[2013-09-13 11:40:14] phasze: yeah, so any "driver" use would call my "super" method to execute before and then continue
[2013-09-13 11:40:23] jimevans: yep.
[2013-09-13 11:40:30] phasze: that would be perfect
[2013-09-13 11:40:40] phasze: time to research and impliment
[2013-09-13 11:40:46] phasze: thank you muchly jimevans
[2013-09-13 11:40:47] jimevans: of course in .net you could look at the eventfiringwebdriver, which may give you enough hooks that you need.
[2013-09-13 11:40:55] phasze: 0.o
[2013-09-13 11:41:16] jimevans: it's in the support assembly (WebDriver.Support.dll)

[2013-09-13 11:42:20] lukeis: hahaha ;)
[2013-09-13 11:42:22] jimevans: i'm not an idiot 100% of the time.
[2013-09-13 11:43:56] jimevans: there used to be some issues using EventFiring* with the advanced user interactions api (the Actions class), but i think i've worked all those out.
[2013-09-13 11:44:38] phasze: sweet
[2013-09-13 11:45:12] phasze: We use Actions a bit so I hope they work :P
[2013-09-13 11:45:39] jimevans: if you run into problems, let me know.
[2013-09-13 11:46:18] phasze: I do have one question with this, I think I've seen before that if I execute some javascript on a page while an alert is up it closes the alert
[2013-09-13 11:46:40] phasze: is that intended?  I haven't checked with the latest build of selenium but I'll check now.
[2013-09-13 11:47:51] figuringout: folks: i tried to take a screenshot from selenium before i tried to find my element, and it shows up just fine -- and its not in a frame, so what could it be?

[2013-09-13 15:53:27] Dude-X: phasze: a WebElement has no idea how it got there
[2013-09-13 15:54:03] Dude-X: you'd have to subclass the SearchContext class (in java) to return a web element that has the original query
[2013-09-13 15:54:35] Dude-X: phasze: i get around that problem by writing a wrapper to the web driver api, so I can keep track of the locator
[2013-09-13 15:54:51] phasze: yeah I'm writing a wrapper right now
[2013-09-13 15:54:51] Dude-X: but i don't inject it in the web element because that's not important info to have

[2013-09-13 15:57:05] Dude-X: usually when i want t do something like that, it's better to find a better way to wait for an element to be in a "ready" state

[2013-09-13 16:04:50] phasze: doesn't help if they've saved and element but for new ones it would
