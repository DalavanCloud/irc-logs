[2013-09-11 06:25:10] jimevans: p_l: just sayin'. if it's that important to you, that's the answer. y'know, using the right tool for the right job and all that.
[2013-09-11 06:25:29] p_l: jimevans: yep. In general, I agree with you regarding "no http error codes" etc.
[2013-09-11 06:25:54] p_l: I was thinking more of an interface that could let you bring similar data user could by opening "page information" dialog and similar
[2013-09-11 06:26:03] jimevans: what gets me is, we've said all along, "hey, you really want to use a proxy for this".
[2013-09-11 06:26:08] p_l: haha
[2013-09-11 06:26:32] simonstewart: p_l: who would implement that interface?
[2013-09-11 06:26:39] jimevans: so folks come back and say either, "but that's too haaaaaard!!!!" or, "you're being too vague"
[2013-09-11 06:26:43] simonstewart: And who would define it?
[2013-09-11 06:26:53] Dude-X: i am reading comment #115 and I don't understand how using a web browser can test http status codes for search engine removal of a page

[2013-09-11 06:27:20] jimevans: to which the responses were, in general, "you still suck."
[2013-09-11 06:27:55] p_l: simonstewart: If I had satisfactory answers, I'd be using different words than wishy-washy "it would be nice". I went into selenium fully accepting "functional tests only" and "we are going to be as close to generic user as possible"
[2013-09-11 06:28:01] simonstewart: :)
[2013-09-11 06:28:25] simonstewart: I think that a lot of the discussion hinges on being able to answer that question, though.
[2013-09-11 06:28:43] simonstewart: It doesn't "feel" like a responsibility of the selenium project
[2013-09-11 06:28:48] simonstewart: since it tramples on things such as proxies
[2013-09-11 06:28:53] simonstewart: and the web timing specs
[2013-09-11 06:29:14] p_l: I was thinking of those being at most for extended logging when something does crap out during functional operation, so only things that if possible could be gleaned from browser's dev console
[2013-09-11 06:29:21] p_l: no messing with page itself
[2013-09-11 06:29:54] p_l: If I knew how to reliably let selenium access some elements of the browser, even through an extra plugin, I'd be overjoyed :)
[2013-09-11 06:30:18] simonstewart: p_l: I used to just aggregate logs across servers and tests
[2013-09-11 06:30:24] p_l: but that's blue-sky thinking, kind of
[2013-09-11 06:30:33] jimevans: my favorite was comment 113, where that... guy says, "sucks that it took you three posts to describe it". i really wanted to just be an asshat and say, "yeah, i could've done it in one post, just giving the code and letting you figure it out, but i wanted to take it one step at a time for people coming from a less experienced background. <insert some derogatory name here>."

[2013-09-11 06:30:48] p_l: simonstewart: unfortunately logs wouldn't exactly help when it's some dynamic JS fucking up without exactly being visible on screen
[2013-09-11 06:31:06] simonstewart: Yeah. That's a separate thing.
[2013-09-11 06:31:10] jimevans: but the comments on an issue aren't the place to say something like that if you have any sense of decorum or professionalism.

[2013-09-11 06:32:02] p_l: simonstewart: but when it comes to scope of the project, I see more sense in supporting efforts to integrate or interact with functional testing interfaces for some other web technologies

[2013-09-11 06:32:23] simonstewart: p_l: go on
[2013-09-11 06:33:07] p_l: simonstewart: I was thinking of something that could let me muck with a flash-based chart used in some part of the application, without separating it from Selenium tests
[2013-09-11 06:33:17] simonstewart: Ah that.
[2013-09-11 06:33:24] simonstewart: Like the FlashSelenium of old?
[2013-09-11 06:33:26] p_l: simonstewart: maybe even not integrating, but "tunnelling"
[2013-09-11 06:33:30] p_l: haven't seen FlashSelenium
[2013-09-11 06:33:43] p_l: honestly, we still have more issues to deal with than testing the flash parts ;)
[2013-09-11 06:34:15] jimevans: simonstewart: and i'd let him. i'm genuinely interested in people's opinions about stuff which is why i invite a more real-time interaction.

[2013-09-11 06:36:19] p_l: that is, FlashDriver wouldn't even necessarily have to be part of Selenium, but could be another test library, just "tunneled" over WebDriver

[2013-09-11 06:36:52] p_l: (because thinking of building everything needed to sync WebDriver with few other things when we already have problems dealing with page loads... urk)
[2013-09-11 06:37:34] p_l: simonstewart: could be a start. But probably would need something hairy to inject it into SWF files etc :)

[2013-09-11 08:51:33] lukeis: (or really just disable it, since it should be changed to ff24, but no point in having two ff24 builds)
[2013-09-11 08:52:23] barancev|2: right
[2013-09-11 08:52:32] jimevans: lukeis: we need to keep firefox 10 around until firefox 26. yes, 24 is an ESR, but we can still support 10 as "previous ESR" until 25 is no longer "current or previous"
[2013-09-11 08:52:58] jimevans: er, 24 is no longer "current or previous"
[2013-09-11 08:53:07] lukeis: that doesn't make sense to me
[2013-09-11 08:53:24] jimevans: think of it this way: we always support four versions of firefox.
[2013-09-11 08:53:26] barancev|2: makes sense, we have to allow transition period
[2013-09-11 08:53:51] lukeis: but the current ESR is 24
[2013-09-11 08:53:58] lukeis: and previous is 17
[2013-09-11 08:54:03] lukeis: (come next week)
[2013-09-11 08:54:09] jimevans: yes, technically, that's true.
[2013-09-11 08:54:18] barancev|2: it will be "current" when people witll migrate to it
[2013-09-11 08:54:30] jimevans: but if you drop 10, then you only support 3 versions of firefox.
[2013-09-11 08:54:34] lukeis: if people aren't at least on FF17 by now… :-/
[2013-09-11 08:54:42] jimevans: (because they're overlapping)
[2013-09-11 08:54:46] lukeis: yes
[2013-09-11 08:54:54] lukeis: i don't see an issue with that :)
[2013-09-11 08:54:58] jimevans: my point is don't do that.
[2013-09-11 08:55:17] lukeis: other than "don't"… i don't see the reasoning there
[2013-09-11 08:55:21] barancev|2: technically, it is easier to keep support for 4 versions
[2013-09-11 08:55:44] barancev|2: otherwise, we'll have to reconfigure plugin manifest
[2013-09-11 08:55:56] lukeis: we always have to do the plugin manifest
[2013-09-11 08:55:57] jimevans: barancev|2: exactly so. you beat me to it.

[2013-09-11 09:00:00] jimevans: lukeis: i understand your logic, i just think supporting more is better. and since ESR17 is supported for three more releases..
[2013-09-11 09:00:06] lukeis: cause then, you're saying  Current, Current-1, ESR, ESR-1, except when ESR == Current || ER == Current −1, Then Current, Current −1, ESR-1, ESR-2

[2013-09-11 09:00:47] jimevans: and i don't see anything wrong with that.

[2013-09-11 09:01:01] barancev|2: I predict dawagner will vote for dropping FF10 ^)
[2013-09-11 09:01:05] Dude-X: actually i think it's okay to drop 10; companies who want to use 10 and stay there won't upgrade
[2013-09-11 09:01:05] lukeis: i think it's carrying along (dragging) FF10 for too long

[2013-09-11 10:04:19] stackedsax1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-11 10:04:31] jimevans: official support story is current, current-1, esr and esr-1.
[2013-09-11 10:04:53] jimevans: that's great, unless latest esr is also current or current-1
[2013-09-11 10:05:44] jimevans: the question is, do we drop support for esr-1 (current firefox 10) while the latest esr (firefox 24) wends its way down to being two releases old (at firefox 26)?
[2013-09-11 10:06:16] jleyba: keep it simple.  current, current-1, esr and esr-1
[2013-09-11 10:06:19] jimevans: if so, we now support 3 versions of firefox instead of 4
[2013-09-11 10:06:23] jleyba: if there's overlap, there's overlap
[2013-09-11 10:07:42] simonstewart: Agreed.
[2013-09-11 10:07:59] jimevans: i've got a massive case of the "i don't give a damn"s today, so i really don't care which way we go, i just think it's easier from a build perspective to always build the four libs, but whatever.
[2013-09-11 10:08:04] simonstewart: Current, current -1, esr, esr -1
[2013-09-11 10:08:18] simonstewart: And if two of those version numbers match, then we only support three versions for a bit

[2013-09-11 13:31:20] monk12: I was wondering is it possible for the wait.until to actually still pass if the page1 is still loading page2
[2013-09-11 13:31:40] lukeis: barancev|2: i didn't think i did… which job?
[2013-09-11 13:31:41] monk12: like i was hoping i wouldnt have to check for a specific element on page2,3,4, etc

[2013-09-11 13:33:35] lukeis: will do
[2013-09-11 13:33:52] lukeis: wouldn't we want that for FF23 (and 25 when it comes out)?
[2013-09-11 13:34:38] barancev|2: it is not so critical
[2013-09-11 13:34:44] lukeis: ok ;)

[2013-09-11 13:35:01] barancev|2: tnx!
[2013-09-11 13:35:19] monk12: I wasnt sure if that basically will just re-check the current page1 which is still loading  page2 so chance of an issue if page2 doesn't load quickly
[2013-09-11 13:36:43] lukeis: monk12: you can wait for the stalenessOf that form element on page one
[2013-09-11 13:37:06] barancev|2: monk12: when a browser is "loading page2" it is not "still showing page1", it is loading page 2, it is in an intermittant state :)

[2013-09-11 13:38:07] barancev|2: and there is no way to check the current "page loading state", you can only check elements (presense, staleness, visibility, etc)

[2013-09-11 13:41:20] lukeis: you can look at the source of it if you like :)

[2013-09-11 13:43:25] lukeis: monk12: the elementToBeClickable one is more like what you were doing, but since you said the element may exist on both pages, doing staleness is more correct
[2013-09-11 13:43:26] barancev|2: staleness of an element means that either the whole page DOM was diminished (replaced by another page's DOM) or a part of the current DOM was rebuilt where this element belongs

[2013-09-11 13:50:32] lukeis: granted appium is a bit more integrated ;)
[2013-09-11 13:51:08] barancev|2: like browsers -- saucers update them by schedule or by request
[2013-09-11 13:51:34] lukeis: more like 'chromedriver' … not like browsers
[2013-09-11 13:51:53] lukeis: xcode is like browser ;)
[2013-09-11 13:52:03] lukeis: (iOS version that is)

[2013-09-11 13:52:38] monk12: barancev|2: when you say its can also happen when 'part of the current DOM was rebuilt where this element belongs' ... what does that mean exactly? like what 'part 'is considered to be looked at for changes? pretend javascript updates a sibling element or a footer element? would that trigger stalenessOf
[2013-09-11 13:53:04] lukeis: monk12: if the element is no longer attached to the DOM tree

[2013-09-11 13:53:34] monk12: oh just the 1 Element itself. how about if the element gets a new attr? also considered stale i would guess
[2013-09-11 13:53:36] lukeis: sometimes javascript 'updates' an element by replacing it (removing the original)
[2013-09-11 13:53:38] barancev|2: monk12: yes, if javascript deletes an element or detaches it from the DOM it becames "stale"
[2013-09-11 13:53:46] santiycr, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-11 13:54:07] lukeis: the elements attributes can change without it becoming stale
[2013-09-11 13:54:32] barancev|2: and it can be detached because its parent or grandpa detached
[2013-09-11 13:55:46] lukeis: i'm still alive even though my grandpa is detached! ;)
[2013-09-11 13:56:41] barancev|2: and we can make a conclusion that you're not a DOM node, right?

[2013-09-11 14:00:46] lukeis: shadow dom is for things like <input type=date>  <- where chrome shows the calendar widget when clicked…. right?  (or I know nothing about what it is)
[2013-09-11 14:00:47] barancev|2: (jimevans it was your speech)

[2013-09-11 14:01:45] monk12: i just assumed it was some c++ control for IE that shows up.
[2013-09-11 14:02:03] jleyba: lukeis: in chrome, try
[2013-09-11 14:02:03] monk12: does it create extra HTML in the background actually?
[2013-09-11 14:02:04] jleyba: var root = document.body.webkitCreateShadowRoot();
[2013-09-11 14:02:17] jleyba: root.innerHTML = '<H1>HI</H1>'
[2013-09-11 14:02:20] barancev|2: btw, about html5, our drag-n-drop implementation can't deal with html5 events ondrag and ondrop
[2013-09-11 14:03:01] jleyba: a shadow root for an element basically replaces how it is rendered (so internally, the calendar widget is implemented with shadow dom)
[2013-09-11 14:03:38] lukeis: that just replaced my whole page? can you then remove that root?
[2013-09-11 14:04:15] jleyba: I don't think so.  Once you create a root for an element, it's there for good
[2013-09-11 14:04:26] barancev|2: HAHAHA!!!
[2013-09-11 14:04:27] jleyba: You *can* have multiple roots for an element and splice them together
[2013-09-11 14:04:32] lukeis: not very um, shadow-like
[2013-09-11 14:04:49] jleyba: hidden dom
[2013-09-11 14:04:52] jleyba: inspect your page contents
[2013-09-11 14:05:15] jleyba: webkit inspector will still show the original DOM, not what you've rendered

[2013-09-11 14:18:38] lukeis: doing it via javascript means people will start doing *crazy* shit
[2013-09-11 14:18:51] barancev|2: lukeis: yes, but the question is: how are we going to implement sendKeys for such fields?

[2013-09-11 14:19:11] barancev|2: it was already discussed on the dev llist
[2013-09-11 14:19:13] lukeis: we shouldn't… shadow dom / switch (or however) should be done
[2013-09-11 14:19:38] jleyba: interacting with shadow dom elements is relatively straight forward.  the main hurdle is going to be the stupid staleness checks
[2013-09-11 14:19:42] barancev|2: swicthing to shadom dom is not compatible with old browsers
[2013-09-11 14:20:04] lukeis: true, tests will need to know what browser they are running against :)
[2013-09-11 14:20:20] barancev|2: no, you're not serious about it!
[2013-09-11 14:20:28] lukeis: i'm not?
[2013-09-11 14:20:37] barancev|2: hm..
[2013-09-11 14:21:04] lukeis: my tests know what they are running against...
[2013-09-11 14:21:20] barancev|2: sendKeys to an input type="date" should work in all browsers equally
[2013-09-11 14:21:31] lukeis: i don't agree
[2013-09-11 14:21:45] barancev|2: internally we can implement it via shadow dom or other evil toys
[2013-09-11 14:21:55] barancev|2: but it should just work
[2013-09-11 14:22:22] lukeis: i don't like that idea… means we'd be implementing for every browsers shadow dom… does chromedriver have to implement that themselves?
[2013-09-11 14:22:49] barancev|2: means all users will have to tune tests for all browsers?
[2013-09-11 14:23:03] barancev|2: every single user!
[2013-09-11 14:23:06] lukeis: they should have the ability to
[2013-09-11 14:23:49] lukeis: until all browsers act the same, they should :)
[2013-09-11 14:24:18] barancev|2: if they can implement utility methods for all the browser we can do too
[2013-09-11 14:24:35] barancev|2: and hide them behind sendKeys
[2013-09-11 14:24:36] lukeis: i don't mind have support wrappers
[2013-09-11 14:24:43] barancev|2: like we do for file inputs

[2013-09-11 14:45:16] mdas: hahah
[2013-09-11 14:46:16] jimevans: once the marionette gang gets the compliance issues out of the way, i'll feel better about my .net native marionette client, and can then really start paying attention to the test failures for firefox desktop.
[2013-09-11 14:46:17] mdas: hah, that's awesome
[2013-09-11 14:46:17] mdas: we have a bot in our channel that randomly spews out previously said /me comments

[2013-09-11 14:53:22] jimevans: oi!

[2013-09-11 15:30:31] jimevans: use the go build script. the target you want is //javascript/ie-driver:atoms
[2013-09-11 15:30:49] alabaster: jimevans: which build script?
[2013-09-11 15:30:54] jimevans: ./go
[2013-09-11 15:30:59] jimevans: that's the only way to do it.

[2013-09-11 15:34:04] jimevans: you really don't want to use the existing IE driver for that.
[2013-09-11 15:34:06] imphasing, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-11 15:34:12] jimevans: or IE driver atoms for that
[2013-09-11 15:34:21] alabaster: jimevans: and why is that?
[2013-09-11 15:34:24] lurky1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-11 15:34:37] jimevans: all of the IE driver's frame handling is done in C++, not in the atoms.
[2013-09-11 15:34:45] alabaster: ohhh...
[2013-09-11 15:34:59] jimevans: because the atoms can't do cross-domain frames.

[2013-09-11 15:35:55] alabaster: that will be pure js for automation?
[2013-09-11 15:35:57] jimevans: possibly
[2013-09-11 15:36:00] jimevans: i don't know.
[2013-09-11 15:36:13] jimevans: i think most of the atoms are frame-free.
[2013-09-11 15:36:22] jimevans: specifically because of the sandbox.
[2013-09-11 15:38:24] lukeis: yeah, there's nothing in the atoms for frame handling
[2013-09-11 15:39:27] lukeis: firefoxdriver has an implementation (in js) but in the extension only…. and I wrote something in Obj-C for the (defunct) iPhoneDriver… everything handles it in it's own way

[2013-09-11 15:43:22] jimevans: probably because the visibility algorithm changed then.
