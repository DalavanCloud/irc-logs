[2013-09-17 04:53:06] barancev: (no strong type checking)
[2013-09-17 04:53:18] barancev: so you have to check capabilities

[2013-09-17 05:40:57] sr78ger, quitting. (Max SendQ exceeded)
[2013-09-17 05:41:02] AutomatedTester: tobie_: what types of tasks?
[2013-09-17 05:41:18] tobie_: running tests
[2013-09-17 05:41:39] sr78ger, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-17 05:43:13] AutomatedTester: tobie_: since each action is a call from local to remote it can only say when 1 action is complete
[2013-09-17 05:43:38] AutomatedTester: except for advanced user interactions, that sends it over as 1 call and waits for it to finish
[2013-09-17 05:44:05] AutomatedTester: well that will be the case when the OSS project implements it
[2013-09-17 05:44:11] AutomatedTester: its already like that in Marionette
[2013-09-17 05:45:34] AutomatedTester: tobie_: make sense?
[2013-09-17 05:45:51] tobie_: Right, so if I load a page and this page runs a bunch of JS, I have no way for that JS to signal to the local end when it's done, right?
[2013-09-17 05:46:13] AutomatedTester: no
[2013-09-17 05:46:17] AutomatedTester: well...
[2013-09-17 05:46:19] AutomatedTester: yes
[2013-09-17 05:46:25] AutomatedTester: well
[2013-09-17 05:46:39] tobie_: That sounds straightforward.
[2013-09-17 05:46:44] tobie_: :p
[2013-09-17 05:47:06] AutomatedTester: you need the page to run JS and then do an execute_async_script call that has a call back for the data
[2013-09-17 05:47:11] barancev: http://libwat.ch/lib/selenium -- "Selenium 2.5.0 today" O_O
[2013-09-17 05:47:34] AutomatedTester: tobie_: and that *might* wait for you
[2013-09-17 05:48:05] tobie_: unless the connection closed?
[2013-09-17 05:48:24] AutomatedTester: yes
[2013-09-17 05:50:05] AutomatedTester: tobie_: is this in relation to James Graham's email?
[2013-09-17 05:50:12] tobie_: Yes it is.
[2013-09-17 05:50:35] tobie_: I had a model in mind that avoided relying on a window opener
[2013-09-17 05:50:43] tobie_: For contexts where that is not supported.
[2013-09-17 05:51:19] tobie_: (e.g. mobile/tv, in app browsers, epub readers, etc)
[2013-09-17 05:53:08] tobie_: So what I had in mind was: make the browser visit a url, that launches the tests, when the tests are run, just advise the local end. Repeat with a different url
[2013-09-17 05:54:03] AutomatedTester: um... not sure how the atoms tests work
[2013-09-17 05:54:40] AutomatedTester: but that might do what you want

[2013-09-17 11:44:30] jimevans: AutomatedTester: ^^
[2013-09-17 11:44:43] AutomatedTester: so its what I thought
[2013-09-17 11:45:03] AutomatedTester: native events causing the crash
[2013-09-17 11:45:37] *AutomatedTester doesnt know the native events C++ code'
[2013-09-17 11:46:43] jimevans: well, yeah, ultimately, i guess that's true, but it was simply in the act of loading the binary components, not even in executing anything in the binaries.
[2013-09-17 11:47:05] AutomatedTester: I suspect Firefox does something on load
[2013-09-17 11:47:23] jimevans: probably
[2013-09-17 11:47:30] AutomatedTester: e.g. does the native code attach properly? no ahhh fuck *crash*
[2013-09-17 11:48:02] jimevans: anyway, at least it doesn't crash anymore, and tests pass locally against 24 on windows.
[2013-09-17 11:48:15] AutomatedTester: sans native events
[2013-09-17 11:48:18] AutomatedTester: ?
[2013-09-17 11:48:24] jimevans: no, with native events.
[2013-09-17 11:48:29] AutomatedTester: oh
[2013-09-17 11:49:07] AutomatedTester: and on ESR?
[2013-09-17 11:49:16] jimevans: 17 ESR?
[2013-09-17 11:49:20] AutomatedTester: yes
[2013-09-17 11:49:23] AutomatedTester: and 24 ESR
[2013-09-17 11:49:29] jimevans: haven't tried 24 ESR
[2013-09-17 11:49:39] AutomatedTester: that will be a good one to try
[2013-09-17 11:49:50] jimevans: 17 ESR seems to be working fine in :ci

[2013-09-17 11:50:26] AutomatedTester: do we host Firefox or do we offload to Sauce?
[2013-09-17 11:50:33] jimevans: we offload
[2013-09-17 11:50:45] jimevans: all ci tests are running against sauce, afiak
[2013-09-17 11:50:52] jimevans: or afaik even
[2013-09-17 11:51:05] AutomatedTester: santiycr: gutentag... when will Firefox 24 ESR be up on Sauce for us to test?
[2013-09-17 11:51:31] barancev: AutomatedTester: it is already there, on linux
[2013-09-17 11:51:44] AutomatedTester: barancev: do we have this crash on linux?
[2013-09-17 11:51:54] barancev: no more crashes
[2013-09-17 11:52:17] AutomatedTester: right and native events work on 24 ESR on Windows?
[2013-09-17 11:52:44] barancev: is 24 ESR equivalent to regular FF24?
[2013-09-17 11:52:53] AutomatedTester: should be
[2013-09-17 11:53:01] AutomatedTester: but... who knows
[2013-09-17 11:53:04] barancev: I tested on regular 24
[2013-09-17 11:53:21] AutomatedTester: if we are confident then remove commented lines

[2013-09-17 11:53:40] barancev: it will be uncommented in two releases
[2013-09-17 11:53:52] PaulB010101, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-17 11:53:53] barancev: atm we support 3 releases of FF

[2013-09-17 11:54:19] tilgovi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-17 11:54:37] barancev: so I think it was a collision of two dlls for the same version
[2013-09-17 11:54:47] jimevans: AutomatedTester: barancev is right. i left it commented because it'll just be uncommented again when 26 comes out, and 24 rolls into using the latest esr binary component.
[2013-09-17 11:55:37] jimevans: because even if v24 and 24-esr are separate builds, they'll still load the same binary (c++) code.
[2013-09-17 11:55:48] barancev: true
[2013-09-17 11:56:08] AutomatedTester: ok
[2013-09-17 11:56:10] barancev: and now I worry about FF23
[2013-09-17 11:56:54] barancev: AutomatedTester: can you run test swith native events locally in FF23?
[2013-09-17 11:57:06] barancev: 2-3 test cases would be enough
[2013-09-17 11:57:06] AutomatedTester: barancev: not at the moment
[2013-09-17 11:57:26] barancev: jimevans: do you have a linux box with FF23?

[2013-09-17 12:16:22] Ardesco: hmm the take screenshot code
[2013-09-17 12:16:23] barancev: jimevans: so it should be something specific to sauce env, right?
[2013-09-17 12:16:36] Ardesco: if it was asked to take a screenshot on a site like google images
[2013-09-17 12:16:48] Ardesco: would it keep trying to scroll down to the bottom of the page
[2013-09-17 12:16:52] Ardesco: even though it's infinite
[2013-09-17 12:16:59] Ardesco: or facebook
[2013-09-17 12:17:03] jimevans: barancev: i suppose so.
[2013-09-17 12:17:07] Ardesco: any site that has infinite scrolling basically
[2013-09-17 12:17:41] jimevans: Ardesco: depends on the browser, but IE would find out how big the page was at the time you requested the screenshot, and that would be the size you'd get.
[2013-09-17 12:17:56] stephend: AutomatedTester: if he's around, whimboo might know
[2013-09-17 12:18:08] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: no, it will take a screenshot of the DOM as is in most browsers
[2013-09-17 12:18:12] stephend: (re: doorhanger disabling)
[2013-09-17 12:18:25] Ardesco: that answers that question then

[2013-09-17 12:18:32] stephend: np
[2013-09-17 12:18:32] Ardesco: next one, is there a maximum screenshot size?
[2013-09-17 12:18:52] Ardesco: i'm guessing not really
[2013-09-17 12:18:54] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: for FirefoxDriver we push the DOM to a canvas and then ask for the dataurl of what is created
[2013-09-17 12:19:06] asavchuk, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-17 12:19:16] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: maximum is the max size base64 can cope with
[2013-09-17 12:19:18] jimevans: Ardesco: again, no idea about other browsers, but IE will cap its screenshot size at 65536 pixels.
[2013-09-17 12:19:33] jimevans: (in either direction)
[2013-09-17 12:19:47] AutomatedTester: jleyba: plugins.notifyMissingFlash for flash
[2013-09-17 12:20:03] Ardesco: so if it capped it would i get a valid screenshot
[2013-09-17 12:20:18] Ardesco: of what it could take
[2013-09-17 12:20:25] jimevans: for IE, yes.
[2013-09-17 12:20:26] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: you would likely get an error if it exceeded its limit
[2013-09-17 12:20:40] AutomatedTester: well for Firefox

[2013-09-17 12:23:06] jimevans: well, it's actually somewhat less than that. it's the 65534 pixels that we will resize the window to, so the effective screenshot will be that size minus the size of the browser chrome. (windows can't resize the window any larger than that, apparently)

[2013-09-17 12:39:01] jleyba: jimevans: bot.inject.executeScript and bot.inject.executeAsyncScript?
[2013-09-17 12:39:41] jimevans: no, in general. there's a webdriver.atoms.inject.frame.findFrameByIndex
[2013-09-17 12:39:49] jimevans: and friends
[2013-09-17 12:40:07] jimevans: how are they intended to be used?
[2013-09-17 12:40:11] jleyba: yeah, those are all composites of bot.inject.executeScript and another atom
[2013-09-17 12:41:01] jleyba: ok, consider webdriver.atoms.inject.dom.getText... suppose you have it compiled into a fragment, $GET_TEXT
[2013-09-17 12:41:35] jleyba: then it's just:  $GET_TEXT({"ELEMENT": "webelement-id"})

[2013-09-17 12:41:56] arex\\: would appreciate any thoughts on this
[2013-09-17 12:41:56] jleyba: that will decode the WebElement JSON object using the cache stored on the document evaluating the injected script
[2013-09-17 12:41:57] arex\\: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18812326/alternatives-for-automated-web-application-front-end-performance-testing
[2013-09-17 12:42:40] jleyba: and "window" will refer to the window the script is evaluating in
[2013-09-17 12:43:24] timbo1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-17 12:43:45] jimevans: i'm going to have to play around with that.
[2013-09-17 12:44:08] jleyba: bot.inject.executeScript does let you specify a window
[2013-09-17 12:44:34] jleyba: ex)  bot.inject.executeScript("return document.title", [], window.frames[2])
[2013-09-17 12:45:08] jleyba: when you provide a Window like that, it will compile the script in the context of the target window, so "window" refers to the target and not the evaluating window
[2013-09-17 12:45:39] jleyba: but that is bound by SOP
[2013-09-17 12:46:11] jimevans: sure. that's a given.
