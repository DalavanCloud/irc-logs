[2013-09-29 03:32:54] javalover: right now it's just doing it based on where I click etc.   but i'd like it to just mouseover all links on page load  that is my 1 question, but even if you can't answer it thank you so much this tool is awesome!!

[2013-09-29 03:41:41] Purefan: Hello all! Newbie on first try here. Using Selenium IDE I want to check if an element exists then enter some values and submit the form, otherwise do nothing. Here is my latest try http://i.imgur.com/Pibq8rU.png I am using storeElementPresent and gotoIf but no luck
[2013-09-29 03:42:31] Purefan: would you please enlighten me as to why it doesn't jump to the label?

[2013-09-29 10:35:49] gics: sorry if that sound like a silly question....the fact i'm new to python and selenium too
[2013-09-29 10:36:18] gics: actually if i do:  el = driver.find_elements_by_class_name("my_class")
[2013-09-29 10:37:11] gics: it return to me list "el" with many "selenium.webdriver.remote.webelement.WebElement object at 0x1a2f550"
[2013-09-29 10:37:24] Dude-X__: once you have an element
[2013-09-29 10:37:28] gics: which i think are data i need to work on
[2013-09-29 10:37:30] Dude-X__: you have to interact with it
[2013-09-29 10:37:39] Dude-X__: either you can get .text or .click()
[2013-09-29 10:37:47] gics: text it's sufficient?
[2013-09-29 10:37:53] Dude-X__: or retreive an attribute with .get_attribute("")
[2013-09-29 10:38:04] Dude-X__: if its text you're locating maybe
[2013-09-29 10:38:13] Dude-X__: it depends on why you're grabbing those elements

[2013-09-29 10:39:07] gics: so there is no other way than do a for
[2013-09-29 10:39:14] gics: now finally i know
[2013-09-29 10:39:43] gics: the element i'm trying to get it's a td in the example
[2013-09-29 10:40:15] gics: from which i'd like to extract(and store) different values like numbers or string
[2013-09-29 10:40:34] Dude-X__: you can't change what's on a webpage
[2013-09-29 10:40:53] Dude-X__: but i suppose you can change what you get back from a webpage
[2013-09-29 10:41:11] gics: i was diffident on text alone because in python shell it seemed slow to print out name
[2013-09-29 10:41:32] gics: no i don't need to change anything in the original page
[2013-09-29 10:41:41] gics: just collect values
[2013-09-29 10:41:59] gics: already used with .click command/action
[2013-09-29 10:42:13] Dude-X__: then you can simply just convert values to integers with int(value)
[2013-09-29 10:42:17] Dude-X__: if you need to
[2013-09-29 10:42:27] Dude-X__, changing nick to Dude-X_.
[2013-09-29 10:43:05] gics: no i don't need that for now
[2013-09-29 10:43:51] gics: it only sound strange to me to see memory location in my list instead of some strings ;)
[2013-09-29 10:44:27] gics: now i know it's correct output from webdriver i can go on
[2013-09-29 10:44:36] gics: thanks again Dude-X_
[2013-09-29 10:45:14] Dude-X_: well the webelement object is only a reference
[2013-09-29 10:45:26] Dude-X_: it only stores the id of the object retrieved
[2013-09-29 10:45:38] Dude-X_: when you interact with it, it has to talk to the browser again and do something
