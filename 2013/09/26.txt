[2013-09-26 08:39:06] lukeis: which atoms do frame switching?
[2013-09-26 08:39:24] jimevans: the executeScript injected atom is frame-aware.

[2013-09-26 08:40:45] jimevans: yep. it has an optional "window" argument that takes a frame element reference, and executes the script in that window context. at least, that's what's advertised.
[2013-09-26 08:40:49] lukeis: in iOS, the context I have to 'execute' always starts with the top window… no access to a frame's 'window'
[2013-09-26 08:40:51] jimevans: that's what i'm struggling with right now.

[2013-09-26 08:41:19] lukeis: i think ;)
[2013-09-26 08:41:35] lukeis: or… maybe not and just using the frame's context to execute the atom I pass in

[2013-09-26 09:06:41] lukeis: I still think using selenium to get http status codes is bloat… and I leave my opinion there ;)
[2013-09-26 09:06:46] nirvdrum: I dislike telling someone, don't do X, do Y, but Y doesn't always work.
[2013-09-26 09:07:24] nirvdrum: lukeis: The problem with that argument (and likely the file upload one too) is the philosophical divide between being a browser automation tool and being a testing tool.  We're not terribly consistent about when we want to be one or the other.
[2013-09-26 09:07:29] lukeis: (of course I wrote ~ 3 years ago a crawler that looked at resource and http status codes...)
[2013-09-26 09:07:35] lukeis: (not using selenium)
[2013-09-26 09:08:02] lukeis: true, we are a bit wishy-washy on that
[2013-09-26 09:08:10] irene-knapp: hm...  I guess I see how it's a scope issue.  (I just started thinking about it two minutes ago, mind you!)
[2013-09-26 09:08:28] nirvdrum: Crawlers that don't execute JS are of decreasing value, unfortunately.  This comes up pretty frequently for mogotest.  We have a dumb crawler and a lot of users that have sites that just don't do anything unless JS is enabled.

[2013-09-26 09:09:10] nirvdrum: irene-knapp: Not unusable for testing.  But if you identify what the product is, that dictates what it should do.
[2013-09-26 09:09:14] irene-knapp: ah, yes, true
[2013-09-26 09:09:50] irene-knapp: so basically it's an issue of not wanting to provide features that are going to be the tip of a wedge to drive ever-more features for general-purpose non-testing automation.
[2013-09-26 09:09:54] nirvdrum: irene-knapp: E.g., using Selenium to upload a file may be a bad way to test it (or at least there are other ways to test that).  But if it's a browser automation tool, it's likely valid to automate that action.

[2013-09-26 09:11:20] lukeis: then there's the whole "As a user can do it" notion, which goes in and out ;)  visibility is hard! let's go shopping...

[2013-09-26 09:11:48] nirvdrum: And then you have people like me that complain, but only get around to writing code once a month :-(
[2013-09-26 09:11:55] Dude-X: one issue i have with http status codes is that it encourages people to be lazy testers in that if a single resource responds with 200, that doesn't always mean the right resource loads!

[2013-09-26 09:13:10] Dude-X: in a prior project; we did use selenium in combination with java's net client to check http status codes
[2013-09-26 09:13:25] Dude-X: and that was a mere sanity check to check if all image resources were available
[2013-09-26 09:13:28] nirvdrum: Dude-X: For me, the value isn't in getting 200, but getting virtually any other code.  So I know if it was forbidden, auth is required, a redirect occurred, and so on.  While it's possible a linked image will 401, that rarely happens unless the source doc is also 401.
[2013-09-26 09:13:44] nirvdrum: But, yeah.

[2013-09-26 09:15:52] Dude-X: my feeling is that if something unexpected happens, then you can investigate it deeply; but if you want to write tests around redirects and special http code, then that use case is valid; i am not 100% against the idea of having http status codes in selenium, if it can be done in a way that doesn't slow down the normal usage of selenium
[2013-09-26 09:16:06] lukeis: xapak: you don't ;)   use XPath
[2013-09-26 09:16:12] xapak: (okay)

[2013-09-26 10:22:15] jimevans: jleyba: a quick summary of where i'm at. i can execute arbitrary javascript in the top-level frame. when i try to execute in a frame on the page, it get { "status":13, "value":{"message":"Object doesn't support this action"}}. it doesn't look like there's anything fundamentally wrong with how the atom attempts to execute in the frame context. i've created a stripped-down javascript method that mimics that approach, and it seems to work fine.
[2013-09-26 10:23:41] jimevans: additionally, the unit tests work fine for webdriver.atoms.inject.executeScript.
[2013-09-26 10:24:49] jimevans: so there's something screwy going on in the compiled version of the atom, or i'm calling it incorrectly.

[2013-09-26 10:43:25] jleyba: It's probably something with bot.inject.recompileFunction_

[2013-09-26 12:46:42] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, i usually do before.. but I don't think there is a standard
[2013-09-26 12:47:05] AutomatedTester: I have always done after since I normally want to see the tests first
[2013-09-26 12:47:31] AutomatedTester: never really noticed how others do it till now in a review ;)

[2013-09-26 13:24:06] barancev|2: nirvdrum: hi! do you have an idea how should we configure loggers?
[2013-09-26 13:24:28] barancev|2: we have two options -- logFile and logLevel
[2013-09-26 13:24:43] nirvdrum: I ignore those and use a logging properties file.
[2013-09-26 13:25:26] barancev|2: I know, I mean -- how to configure "defaults" so that this configuration does not interfere with your way
[2013-09-26 13:26:15] barancev|2: if logFile is not set we have to configure a console logger with the logLevel or INFO if logLevel is not specified

[2013-09-26 13:31:45] nirvdrum: barancev|2: I guess I never understood what the problem you're trying to fix is.
[2013-09-26 13:31:50] nirvdrum: Why is having a console logger bad?
[2013-09-26 13:32:26] barancev|2: may be my previous attempt was ugly, I agree
[2013-09-26 13:32:46] barancev|2: we add a ConsoleHandler or a FileHandler, depending on the options
[2013-09-26 13:33:05] barancev|2: but by defualt there is already one ConsoleHandler in the list
[2013-09-26 13:33:27] barancev|2: as a result we've got two handlers and duplicated messages on the console
[2013-09-26 13:33:51] barancev|2: so my "simple patch" was to kill all handlers prior to adding new ones
[2013-09-26 13:34:14] robpark, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-26 13:34:51] nirvdrum: Ahh.  Well, somehow that killed any handlers I registered via -Djava.util.logging.config.file
[2013-09-26 13:35:06] barancev|2: right
[2013-09-26 13:35:47] nirvdrum: So, you're saying you'd end up with a console handler and a file handler?
[2013-09-26 13:36:03] nirvdrum: Or you'd end up with two console handlers?
[2013-09-26 13:36:15] barancev|2: two console handlers
[2013-09-26 13:36:34] nirvdrum: Rather than trynig to delete, wouldn't it make sense to just not add the second console handler?
[2013-09-26 13:36:56] barancev|2: if we log to a file we have to delete console handler
[2013-09-26 13:37:08] nirvdrum: I doubt we have to.
[2013-09-26 13:37:20] nirvdrum: Who cares if it's also logging to the console?
[2013-09-26 13:37:57] barancev|2: I don't know why we do have logFile option at all
[2013-09-26 13:38:09] barancev|2: anybody can redirect stdout to a file
[2013-09-26 13:38:23] nirvdrum: It's trickier on Windows, but yeah.
[2013-09-26 13:38:40] robpark, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2013-09-26 13:38:41] barancev|2: it is no more trickier than on linux
[2013-09-26 13:39:08] nirvdrum: Does it work the same way?  I can't say I've ever even tried.
[2013-09-26 13:39:12] barancev|2: but, well, it is an existing behaviour I'm not going to break
[2013-09-26 13:39:15] nirvdrum: My guess is it was a convenience.
[2013-09-26 13:39:30] barancev|2: yes, on windows you just > file.log
[2013-09-26 13:39:49] barancev|2: exactly the same
[2013-09-26 13:40:07] barancev|2: I don't want to remove an option
[2013-09-26 13:40:37] barancev|2: the logFile options
[2013-09-26 13:40:48] barancev|2: it would be a surprise for someone
[2013-09-26 13:40:55] nirvdrum: I agree.
[2013-09-26 13:41:19] nirvdrum: Your gist is fine to me.  But like I said, I don't think we absolutely need to remove the console handler if the file handler is used, too.
[2013-09-26 13:42:39] barancev|2: then, we'll have to introduce an option to disable logging to console
[2013-09-26 13:42:48] barancev|2: windows has no /dev/null :)

[2013-09-26 13:44:29] nirvdrum: It seems like a solution to a problem no one has.
[2013-09-26 13:45:27] barancev|2: some people do care, because they run selenium server as a subprocess, and have to drain its output stream
[2013-09-26 13:46:03] barancev|2: there are issues related to this in the tracker
[2013-09-26 13:46:07] nirvdrum: Okay.

[2013-09-26 23:54:10] juri`: Anyone knows how to increase performance of chrome and safari? Reading bunch of xpaths takes about 44 seconds to complete, while same code reads values in firefox and opera in about 2-3 seconds.
