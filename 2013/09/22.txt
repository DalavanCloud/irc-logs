[2013-09-22 10:49:05] bapula: i have an interview tomorrow
[2013-09-22 10:49:30] Dude-X: umm
[2013-09-22 10:49:48] Dude-X: bapula: well i'd ask someone, do you know how to program in general
[2013-09-22 10:50:15] bapula: yes I know Dude-x
[2013-09-22 10:50:31] Dude-X: first question i'd ask then is
[2013-09-22 10:50:38] Dude-X: how would you structure your tests
[2013-09-22 10:50:42] bapula: i have experience in vb scripying,qtp
[2013-09-22 10:50:53] bapula: and knowledge in java scriopting also
[2013-09-22 10:51:03] Dude-X: assuming the employer is looking for a tester
[2013-09-22 10:51:05] bapula: upto some extent java programming as well
[2013-09-22 10:53:32] lord1234, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-22 10:54:59] Dude-X: so bapula how do you structure your tests
[2013-09-22 10:55:14] Dude-X: you say you know selenium web driver, so would would you structure your tets
[2013-09-22 10:57:18] bapula: we need to create a firefox profile for that in every program
[2013-09-22 10:57:59] bapula: i mean using webdriver and then proceed with the test
[2013-09-22 10:58:15] smccarthy: explain the page object model
[2013-09-22 10:58:26] Dude-X: the answer i'm looking for has to include the word "page object"
[2013-09-22 10:58:33] bapula: reporting tools we  can use as test ng /junit]
[2013-09-22 10:58:48] bapula: ya we have to create page object
[2013-09-22 10:59:35] smccarthy: bapula: explain it. Also, name the methods you might have on a sign on page object
[2013-09-22 10:59:42] smccarthy: or login page object
[2013-09-22 11:01:15] bapula: do  want me to explzin in terms of coding
[2013-09-22 11:01:27] bapula: should i write down code for that
[2013-09-22 11:04:01] jimpurbrick, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-22 11:04:01] smccarthy: whats the purpose of it
[2013-09-22 11:05:13] Dude-X: you shouldn't have to code anything; you do have to explain in detail how you would arrange your various layers for your test framework
[2013-09-22 11:05:56] smccarthy: bapula: it helps with maintenance. If you have a login page object, and the login page changes, you only have to change the page object, and not all of your tests.
[2013-09-22 11:06:17] bapula: yes
[2013-09-22 11:06:50] bapula: so page object is created for maintenance right
[2013-09-22 11:07:03] smccarthy: Also, for my "what methods on a login page", i was expecting at least a signIn method which takes a username and password (not just enterUsername, enterPassword, clickLogin methods).
[2013-09-22 11:08:10] smccarthy: bapula: last question, "What sound does a fox make?"
[2013-09-22 11:10:52] bapula: what type question is this smccarthy

[2013-09-22 11:23:37] Dude-X: there's phantomJS which is headless.
[2013-09-22 11:24:00] detronizator_: I'd advice toward PhantomJS in this specific case
[2013-09-22 11:24:06] detronizator_: if you are not about testing, but scraping
[2013-09-22 11:24:10] detronizator_: phantomjs can be a good choice
[2013-09-22 11:24:16] Dude-X: but as far as I know, selenium like tools are the only way to process the Javascript
[2013-09-22 11:24:21] detronizator_: (not because I wrote the driver for it :P)
[2013-09-22 11:24:21] cybrNaut: thanks folks.. i'll check it out
[2013-09-22 11:24:55] detronizator_: ah - if you are more familiar with WebDriver, you can hook PhantomJS to Selenium
[2013-09-22 11:25:20] cybrNaut: detronizator_: i had a little experience with selenium, before it all changed around
[2013-09-22 11:25:44] cybrNaut: i've not used selenium since some major change broke my scripts and drivers

[2013-09-22 13:42:07] daemon: I can actually use vnc and goto www.google.com
[2013-09-22 13:42:09] daemon: in the browser just fine
[2013-09-22 13:42:41] daemon: no seems to be sure :(
[2013-09-22 13:42:42] nirvdrum: It could be that the latest Selenium release doesn't support the latest Firefox release.  I don't know to what extent that'd break things though.
[2013-09-22 13:42:48] daemon: I already tested that
[2013-09-22 13:42:52] daemon: at the moment im running:
[2013-09-22 13:43:01] daemon: firefox-esr-17.0.8,1 Web browser based on the browser portion of Mozilla
[2013-09-22 13:43:06] daemon: the extended support release
[2013-09-22 13:43:06] daemon: of ff
[2013-09-22 13:43:34] daemon: I had it running FF23,1 but downgraded to esr when this problem showed up
[2013-09-22 13:43:38] daemon: just as a precaution
[2013-09-22 13:43:45] nirvdrum: 23 is supported.  24 is now.
[2013-09-22 13:43:48] nirvdrum: AFAIK.
[2013-09-22 13:44:02] daemon: this issue appears on both FF17 & FF23 though
[2013-09-22 13:44:11] nirvdrum: Yeah, I'm just letting you know.
[2013-09-22 13:44:14] daemon: ah :)
[2013-09-22 13:44:56] nirvdrum: I don't have many other clues, unfortunately.  The only reason I've ever seen that timeout is because of X problems.
[2013-09-22 13:45:06] nirvdrum: And I suspect if you google for it, that's all you'll find too :-/
[2013-09-22 13:45:10] daemon: oddly this setup also works in a vbox
[2013-09-22 13:45:20] daemon: already googled for it there are many instancers of this problem but none that match my setup
[2013-09-22 13:45:45] daemon: it even looks like all the sockets are fine
[2013-09-22 13:45:45] daemon: <daemon> paul     firefox    88825 11 tcp4 6 *:4444                *:*

[2013-09-22 13:47:18] daemon: what is that connection about anyway?
[2013-09-22 13:47:24] daemon: java can obviously start firefox
[2013-09-22 13:47:37] daemon: is that the webdriver in firefox trying to connect back to the java server?
[2013-09-22 13:47:52] nirvdrum: Yeah.  The entire command set is JSON over HTTP.
[2013-09-22 13:48:16] daemon: so why is the jav server listening on :4444 not 7055
[2013-09-22 13:48:19] daemon: or 7054
[2013-09-22 13:48:42] nirvdrum: 4444 is the standard Selenium port.  It's what you'd point your clients at in the RemoteWebDriver setup.
[2013-09-22 13:48:51] daemon: yep that bit works ok
[2013-09-22 13:48:58] nirvdrum: If you're not using RemoteWebDriver, you don't need Java at all.
[2013-09-22 13:49:13] daemon: so then the server launches firefox, and that tries to connect to the server on port 7054?
[2013-09-22 13:49:36] daemon: because I cannot see that java server listening on any other port but 4444
[2013-09-22 13:50:05] nirvdrum: It'd be an ephemeral port.
[2013-09-22 13:50:24] nirvdrum: Just whatever it would do in making outgoing connections.
[2013-09-22 13:50:35] nirvdrum: All commands are initiated on the Java end.
[2013-09-22 13:51:10] daemon: so really its selenium connecting to firefox
[2013-09-22 13:51:14] daemon: not the otherway around
[2013-09-22 13:51:27] nirvdrum: Right.
[2013-09-22 13:51:37] daemon: I wonder what it thinks localhost is
[2013-09-22 13:51:43] nirvdrum: Heh.
[2013-09-22 13:51:46] daemon: <daemon> org.openqa.selenium.firefox.NotConnectedException: Unable to connect to host localhost on port 7055 after 45000 ms. Firefox console output:
[2013-09-22 13:51:50] daemon: because it is not 127.0.0.1
[2013-09-22 13:51:50] nirvdrum: I've seen Ubuntu do weird stuff there.
[2013-09-22 13:51:59] nirvdrum: Like make it 127.0.1.1
[2013-09-22 13:52:05] daemon: which is absolutely valid
[2013-09-22 13:52:11] daemon: 127.* is the loopback range
[2013-09-22 13:52:26] daemon: mine is 127.0.0.2
[2013-09-22 13:52:34] daemon: root@automate:/ # host localhost
[2013-09-22 13:52:35] daemon: localhost has address 127.0.0.2
[2013-09-22 13:52:37] nirvdrum: Yeah, but sometimes things bind explicitly to 127.0.0.1.  I have no idea what firefox driver does.
[2013-09-22 13:52:58] daemon: hmmpaul     firefox    41524 14 tcp4   127.0.0.2:7054        *:*
[2013-09-22 13:53:04] daemon: wonder if I can connect to it manually
[2013-09-22 13:53:15] daemon: root@automate:/ # telnet 127.0.0.2 7055
[2013-09-22 13:53:15] daemon: Trying 127.0.0.2...
[2013-09-22 13:53:15] daemon: telnet: connect to address 127.0.0.2: Connection refused
[2013-09-22 13:53:20] daemon: wrong port -_-"
[2013-09-22 13:53:28] daemon: still con refused
[2013-09-22 13:53:41] daemon: so this is the real reason why selenium cannot connect
[2013-09-22 13:53:47] daemon: but why .... if I listen manually on that with nc it works fine
[2013-09-22 13:54:18] daemon: I wonder if I can force webdriver to listen on a different ip altogether
[2013-09-22 13:54:23] daemon: something like 192.168.100.4
[2013-09-22 13:54:26] daemon: on the lan range
[2013-09-22 13:55:36] daemon: ok something is very wrong here
[2013-09-22 13:55:36] daemon: root@automate:/ # nc -l 127.0.0.2 4545
[2013-09-22 13:55:40] daemon: root@automate:/ # telnet 127.0.0.2 4545
[2013-09-22 13:55:44] daemon: Connected to localhost.
[2013-09-22 13:55:56] daemon: so it seems that when something not firefox listens on localhost
[2013-09-22 13:56:02] daemon: it works but when its not firefox, it cannot
[2013-09-22 13:56:11] daemon: when it is firefox, it cannot
[2013-09-22 13:56:22] daemon: nirvdrum, can you do me a favour and try connect to 127.0.0.1 7054
[2013-09-22 13:56:26] daemon: on your machine
[2013-09-22 13:56:33] daemon: see if it lets you connect to it with something like telnet or putty
[2013-09-22 13:57:37] nirvdrum: Not 7054, but yes on 7055.
[2013-09-22 13:57:51] nirvdrum: And that's bound to a completely different IP in your lsof output abov.
[2013-09-22 13:58:47] daemon: odd
[2013-09-22 13:58:51] daemon: look at the ports firefox has bound
[2013-09-22 13:58:51] daemon: paul     firefox    41524 14 tcp4   127.0.0.2:7054        *:*

[2013-09-22 13:58:55] daemon: there on different ips
[2013-09-22 13:59:23] nirvdrum: Do you have different IPs set up for localhost?
[2013-09-22 13:59:27] daemon: no
[2013-09-22 13:59:32] nirvdrum: Is this on Mac by chance?
[2013-09-22 13:59:36] daemon: that instance has three ips
[2013-09-22 13:59:37] daemon: no

[2013-09-22 15:31:59] daemon: because of that it picks the first two it sees and binds to them
[2013-09-22 15:32:44] daemon: I removed the private range 192.168.x.xxxxx and it only had two ips to pick from 127.0.0.2 and the public so ofc worked :)
