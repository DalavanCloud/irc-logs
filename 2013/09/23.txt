[2013-09-23 02:01:21] AutomatedTester: if an element has an opacity of 0, I could click on it if I knew it was there
[2013-09-23 02:01:45] barancev|2: an opaque element is not visible but interactable, right?
[2013-09-23 02:01:50] AutomatedTester: yes
[2013-09-23 02:02:09] AutomatedTester: barancev|2: http://www.w3.org/2013/06/13-testing-minutes.html#item03
[2013-09-23 02:02:14] AutomatedTester: read from there
[2013-09-23 02:02:18] barancev|2: an element behind this opaque one is visible but not interactable?
[2013-09-23 02:02:24] AutomatedTester: yes
[2013-09-23 02:02:53] barancev|2: that was the motive for my question: are we going to take into account layout?
[2013-09-23 02:03:08] AutomatedTester: kinda
[2013-09-23 02:03:10] lemonsparrow, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-23 02:03:50] barancev|2: partial visibility?
[2013-09-23 02:04:10] barancev|2: "not completely hidden behind some other element"
[2013-09-23 02:04:26] AutomatedTester: this is where it gets scary
[2013-09-23 02:04:38] barancev|2: true
[2013-09-23 02:04:49] AutomatedTester: the way we are going to do it in marionette is getElementFromPoint(coords) see if its the element you wish to interact with and then do opacity checks on the area we want to try interact with
[2013-09-23 02:05:18] AutomatedTester: if a) not the element and opacity == 1 then its not visible/interactable
[2013-09-23 02:05:44] AutomatedTester: b) not the element and opacity => 0.04 then its viisble but not interactable
[2013-09-23 02:06:06] AutomatedTester: its not going to get every case
[2013-09-23 02:06:12] barancev|2: a magic number? :)
[2013-09-23 02:06:19] AutomatedTester: the amount of edge cases will be immense
[2013-09-23 02:06:24] barancev|2: 4%
[2013-09-23 02:06:31] AutomatedTester: 0.04 is roughly when you can start to see elements
[2013-09-23 02:06:37] AutomatedTester: but thats my figure
[2013-09-23 02:06:41] AutomatedTester: we may change it

[2013-09-23 03:48:24] ddary: k
[2013-09-23 03:48:31] simonstewart: Any reason why JavaSdk demands that JAVA_HOME is set?
[2013-09-23 03:48:38] simonstewart: On OS X it's almost never set
[2013-09-23 03:48:50] simonstewart: So it's pretty easy to cause selendroid tests to fail on that platform
[2013-09-23 03:48:57] ddary: it is there to build the path of thejarsigner
[2013-09-23 03:49:32] simonstewart: On OS X you can figure out the path to JAVA_HOME using "/usr/libexec/java_home"
[2013-09-23 03:49:59] simonstewart: But, also on OS X, jarsigner is on the PATH
[2013-09-23 03:50:38] andreastt: The same is true for Debian FWIW.
[2013-09-23 03:50:55] andreastt: (That JAVA_HOME is rarely ever set.)
[2013-09-23 03:51:08] ddary: ok, for me the way how it is implemented was clean so it is th same way on all platforms
[2013-09-23 03:51:25] ddary: that is the reason why i said, you have to configure it (in the docs)
[2013-09-23 03:51:35] simonstewart: There are docs? :)
[2013-09-23 03:51:48] ddary: :-)

[2013-09-23 04:42:17] barancev|2: simonstewart: AutomatedTester: a question re synthesized events in FF: if we do actions.moveToElement(el,x,y) and x,y > element dimention, should we fire an event on the passed element or the actual element in the calculated location?
[2013-09-23 04:47:42] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-23 04:51:42] simonstewart: In the ideal world, we'd fire the event on the actual element that the user would be interacting with

[2013-09-23 04:52:17] barancev|2: simonstewart: we can al least try to find an element by position
[2013-09-23 04:52:28] barancev|2: (like wo do in native implementation)
[2013-09-23 04:52:37] simonstewart: I think you may have misread what I wrote
[2013-09-23 04:53:06] simonstewart: I'm saying that if we've wandered out of the bounds of the element specified, we should try and find out which one _would_ receive the events

[2013-09-23 13:48:19] rbp: I have a very curious bug. When i click a certain link in my application, selenium navigates to /var/local/path/of/app/users/logout

[2013-09-23 13:48:38] timbo1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-23 13:48:42] rbp: basically it resolves a relative link as relative to the local filesystem
[2013-09-23 13:48:56] rbp: but only for that link.. it's a logout link
[2013-09-23 13:49:11] phasze: and when you click it it works fine?
[2013-09-23 13:49:18] rbp: ye
[2013-09-23 13:50:16] phasze: hmm, are there multiple elements in the same location?  Maybe your physical click is clicking on something else than the locater selenium is clicking?
[2013-09-23 13:51:21] santiycr, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-23 13:51:35] rbp: hmm
[2013-09-23 13:51:36] rbp: nope
[2013-09-23 13:51:41] rbp: this is the click command
[2013-09-23 13:51:41] rbp: $this->click("css=.tst-signout-button");
[2013-09-23 13:51:58] phasze: are there any other elements that use that class on your page?
[2013-09-23 13:52:33] rbp: no
[2013-09-23 13:54:07] phasze: what about if you run the test and pause it right there and click it manually?
[2013-09-23 13:54:22] phasze: if it still bugs out then I dunno
[2013-09-23 13:55:09] phasze: errr, if it still doesn't bug out
