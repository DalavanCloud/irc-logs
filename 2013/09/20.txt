[2013-09-20 02:28:49] lemonsparrow: I want to give a delay of 2 minutes after the command click and wait.. which selenium api to use
[2013-09-20 02:28:54] jamesoram, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-20 02:29:18] vila, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-20 02:30:13] Dave_B_: you want to wait 2 mins every time or weait up to 2 mins, depending on a condition?
[2013-09-20 02:30:59] lemonsparrow: Dave_B_: actually login after entering username and password takes upto 2 minutes.. so i want selenium to wait for 2 minutes after clicking login before next command runs
[2013-09-20 02:31:01] Dave_B_: actually i don't know what clickandwait does, never used it
[2013-09-20 02:31:14] lemonsparrow: Dave_B_: now it is not able to find the next element since the login is still going on
[2013-09-20 02:31:26] Dave_B_: can you not just do some kind of thread.sleep type command? Or explicit wait?
[2013-09-20 02:33:08] lemonsparrow: Dave_B_: waitforpagetoload should help I guess
[2013-09-20 02:33:33] vila, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-09-20 02:34:21] Dave_B_: I'm thinking something like (c# example)....
[2013-09-20 02:35:10] Dave_B_: new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(120)).Until(d => d.FindElement(By.Id("your_id_here));
[2013-09-20 02:36:00] Dave_B_: so it keeps polling for the next element until it exists (login finished?) or 2 mins are up
[2013-09-20 02:36:51] Dave_B_: if the next element exists before your login is complete then we'd have to find another thing to wait for to tell our tests to continue
[2013-09-20 02:38:00] Dave_B_: oh, is this selenium IDE you're using?
[2013-09-20 02:39:11] Dave_B_: looks like you could probably use waitForElementPresent
[2013-09-20 02:39:41] Dave_B_: waitForPageToLoad is called automatically when clickAndWait is used apparently

[2013-09-20 06:44:03] jimevans: my thinking on this spurred by my recent investigations into javascript runtime errors.

[2013-09-20 06:48:48] barancev: and let's switch from JUL to slf4j, please!
[2013-09-20 06:50:04] nirvdrum, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-20 06:51:14] simonstewart: nope
[2013-09-20 06:51:17] simonstewart: not going to happen
[2013-09-20 06:51:41] simonstewart: I've worked in enough places with enough logging frameworks that picking anything other than in the JDK is folly
[2013-09-20 06:51:44] simonstewart: I know it's shit
[2013-09-20 06:51:59] simonstewart: But it's standard shit that never conflicts with the logging shit that people have selected
[2013-09-20 06:53:47] barancev: it does
[2013-09-20 06:54:14] simonstewart: It does conflict?
[2013-09-20 06:54:18] barancev: it is close to impossible to redirect logs to whatever place I want
[2013-09-20 06:54:39] barancev: and you have to redirect JUL to slf4j or log4j first
[2013-09-20 06:54:39] simonstewart: I know it's fugly
[2013-09-20 06:54:57] simonstewart: Ah. The problem is that you're mixing and matching logging frameworks
[2013-09-20 06:55:02] barancev: and then write it to a file, db, socket
[2013-09-20 06:55:17] simonstewart: I've never had that much trouble configuring JUL.
[2013-09-20 06:55:31] simonstewart: It's shit, and you need to do it as the JRE warms up, but it's not that bad
[2013-09-20 06:55:58] barancev: do you know what slf4j conflicts with?
[2013-09-20 06:56:48] barancev: it is easy to configure, fast (the fastest one), implements bindings to all other loggers (including JUL)
[2013-09-20 06:58:35] simonstewart: sl4j conflicts with older/newer versions of sl4j
[2013-09-20 06:59:05] simonstewart: I'm not getting into a discussion about java logging frameworks
[2013-09-20 06:59:13] barancev: :)
[2013-09-20 06:59:16] simonstewart: :)
[2013-09-20 06:59:26] simonstewart: I fought those battles many times, many, many years ago
[2013-09-20 06:59:40] barancev: me too
[2013-09-20 06:59:53] simonstewart: heh
[2013-09-20 07:00:25] simonstewart: I believe that the next topic would be dependency injection frameworks….
[2013-09-20 07:00:35] PaulB010_, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-20 07:01:02] barancev: btw, we have commons-logging in the dependencies
[2013-09-20 07:01:16] barancev: iirc, html client wants it
[2013-09-20 07:01:21] simonstewart: I know, but it's there transitively
[2013-09-20 07:01:37] barancev: right, but it writes to this logger
[2013-09-20 07:01:44] simonstewart: The old RC server has some shitty other framework in there in places too
[2013-09-20 07:01:50] simonstewart: We'll nuke that one day
[2013-09-20 07:02:01] barancev: and we can't handle this log and redirect it to the same stream as other logs
[2013-09-20 07:02:23] simonstewart: See? Stupid logging frameworks
[2013-09-20 07:02:49] barancev: we could. if we agreed to use slf4j :)
[2013-09-20 07:03:03] barancev: actually, I do use it
[2013-09-20 07:03:16] ddary: hi does anyone can help me / guide me about how to fix https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=5871
[2013-09-20 07:03:17] barancev: because it is possible to redirect JUL to it too
[2013-09-20 07:03:20] simonstewart: I repeat my assertion about only using JUL
[2013-09-20 07:03:56] simonstewart: Really, the apache chaps should switch to JUL
[2013-09-20 07:04:52] qaguy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-09-20 07:06:06] barancev: btw, what conflicts of the versions are you talking about?
[2013-09-20 07:06:25] barancev: I know it is impossible to include in the classpath two different versions of jul
[2013-09-20 07:06:30] simonstewart: not discussing
[2013-09-20 07:06:40] simonstewart: I'm not open to persuasion
[2013-09-20 07:06:48] simonstewart: And I'm not interested in debate on this
[2013-09-20 07:06:55] barancev: and using bindings of a version that is different form the facade version
[2013-09-20 07:07:02] simonstewart: I've been beaten up too many times with clashing logging frameworks in java
[2013-09-20 07:07:09] barancev: irrelative to selenium, nust personal interest
[2013-09-20 07:07:14] simonstewart: :)

[2013-09-20 07:08:44] simonstewart: What to google? "Java logging is a clusterfuck"?
[2013-09-20 07:09:11] barancev: too generic :)
[2013-09-20 07:10:06] ddary: simonstewart: do you may have an idea about how to fix that one :#5871
[2013-09-20 07:10:09] simonstewart: I think that the BileBlog had a lot to say about it

[2013-09-20 07:11:02] simonstewart: He's Mr ChromeDriver
[2013-09-20 07:11:29] ddary: ok, it is also related to the AndroidDriver
[2013-09-20 07:12:10] ddary: and just updateing the dependencies of ngxpath did not solve the problem
[2013-09-20 07:13:00] simonstewart: Not sure off the top of my head

[2013-09-20 11:50:11] phasze: hello petarm
[2013-09-20 11:50:40] rananda, quitting. (Quit: /AWAY Leaving)
[2013-09-20 11:51:09] petarm: I have been trying to find a way to give myself some visual feedback on what elements are being clicked on in selenium (python) but I have not been able to find a way to do that yet... Any ideas anyone? Thanks.
[2013-09-20 11:53:00] petarm: I found suggestions on using JavaScript for inside of selenium, but my JavaScript knowledge is nonexistent...
[2013-09-20 11:53:35] phasze: Yeah javascript would probably be your best bet
[2013-09-20 11:53:40] petarm: Basically what I am looking for is to "highlight" any element that webdriver interacts with... click, send_keys, etc.
[2013-09-20 11:54:24] petarm: I was afraid you would say that... well... I guess I better go learn some javascript?
[2013-09-20 11:54:31] phasze: hehe indeed

[2013-09-20 11:54:39] petarm: Can't hurt, right?
[2013-09-20 11:54:53] phasze: if you have a wrapper you could make any click/send_keys highlight the object in yellow
[2013-09-20 11:55:03] phasze: but again, that would be with javascript
[2013-09-20 11:55:09] Dude-X: execute_script("argument[0].style.border='#FF0000', element)
[2013-09-20 11:55:22] phasze: ^
[2013-09-20 11:55:26] barancev: javascript is hard, let's go shoping!
[2013-09-20 11:55:33] Dude-X: something like that
[2013-09-20 11:56:41] phasze: where are we going barancev? ;)
[2013-09-20 11:57:24] petarm: Yeah, barabcev. Count me in.. Javascript is hard lol... Thank you, Dude-X. I'll try that

[2013-09-20 12:04:59] petarm: Dude-X: I am afraid execute_script("argument[0].style.border='#FF0000', element) did not work... of course I had it with ffDriver.executescript... and element was equal to element object that selenium found with xpath
[2013-09-20 12:05:18] Dude-X: arguments[0]
[2013-09-20 12:05:39] Dude-X: google the common style properties
[2013-09-20 12:05:44] phasze: petarm: you'll need to change that argument[0] to be the element you're trying to select
[2013-09-20 12:06:35] SamuraiJack_, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-20 12:10:05] petarm: do I just change the "0" or I have to replace the whole arguments[0] with something else?

[2013-09-20 12:25:27] petarm: Is there a place where I can find out what "styles" can be manipulated and in which order I need to place the arguments?
