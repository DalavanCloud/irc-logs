[2013-09-19 04:10:00] barancev|2: ff23 said it can't load native componens, but locally all is ok (I tried xubuntu 32 and 64 bit)

[2013-09-19 04:10:59] jimevans: because that might be a difference, if it's building the binaries on the fly

[2013-09-19 07:21:02] dputer: hi, any chance someone here can help with a question regarding writing a plugin for selenium ide?
[2013-09-19 07:22:06] jimevans: dputer: probably not, but you're welcome to ask. most people in the channel don't work with IDE
[2013-09-19 07:22:46] dputer: thanks, problem is #seleniumide is constantly empty
[2013-09-19 07:23:02] dputer: anyways, I need to hook the start/end/fail of a test in my plugin
[2013-09-19 07:23:08] dputer: any ideas how to do that?

[2013-09-19 07:28:32] jimevans: dputer: i personally abhor IDE, and remain purposefully ignorant of it, so i'm going to be no help whatsoever.
[2013-09-19 07:29:33] dputer: thanks anyway jim
[2013-09-19 07:29:45] dputer: I'll try and contact samit again
[2013-09-19 07:30:10] jimevans: barancev|2: so what's really weird is that the firefox 24 native events tests on linux work just fine, but the 23 ones don't.
[2013-09-19 07:30:43] barancev|2: jimevans: locally on your linux box?
[2013-09-19 07:30:52] jimevans: no, in ci.
[2013-09-19 07:31:08] barancev|2: right, 24 works on CI, but 23 does not

[2013-09-19 07:35:13] jimevans: meh, i kinda doubt it. i'd expect lots of TestStudio stuff. though jim holmes is a standup guy, and they do track the selenium project over at telerik.
[2013-09-19 07:35:22] jimevans: so maybe.
[2013-09-19 07:36:08] barancev|2: yes, prev webinars were dedicated to TestStudio
[2013-09-19 07:36:37] barancev|2: but the announce in twitter intimates...
[2013-09-19 07:37:07] jimevans: agreed. i might ping the guy and ask about it.

[2013-09-19 10:30:10] bfife: can ie.ensureCleanSession be set as a selenium standalone argument?
[2013-09-19 10:30:15] bfife: or is it just a capability
[2013-09-19 10:32:35] jimevans: bfife: it's only a capability.
[2013-09-19 10:32:39] jimevans: full stop.
[2013-09-19 10:33:03] tilgovi, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-09-19 10:33:13] jimevans: because it modifies stuff for running browsers and makes permanent changes to the user's machine.
[2013-09-19 10:33:20] bfife: gotcha. i'm adding it to a grid node config
[2013-09-19 10:33:36] bfife: so i just added it to the IE capability there :>
[2013-09-19 10:34:04] jlipps, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-19 10:34:06] bfife: i saw it described as ie.ensureCleanSession, wasn't sure if you could go -Dwebdriver.ie.ensure...
[2013-09-19 10:34:43] jimevans: bfife: nope. at least not as far as i know.
[2013-09-19 10:35:15] phasze: permanent changes as in clearing cache and whatnot or does it make other changes?
[2013-09-19 10:35:58] bfife: i tried to configure IE to clear the cache / not participate in that windows search thing but it looked like temp files remained, hope this works
[2013-09-19 10:36:01] jimevans: phasze: permanent changes as in cache/cookie/history clearing, but will also affect all running instances at the time.
[2013-09-19 10:36:42] phasze: I never run more than one instance of IE anyway because of new windows not handling sessions correctly anyway :P
[2013-09-19 10:37:08] jimevans: so it'll even affect your manually-started instances of IE. not a huge deal in the grid case, where your machine dedicated to automation instances, but if you're running locally, it might cause some grief.
