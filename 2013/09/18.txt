[2013-09-18 01:28:01] juri`: Does anyone know how to fix ClassNotFoundException for com.opera.core.systems.OperaDriver? Tried versions 2.33 and 2.35 of selenium-server-standalone, but getting exception with both.
[2013-09-18 01:28:30] Dave_B_: Um, I don't know the answer but I do know 2.35 doesn't launch Opera for me, think its a known issue and fixed waiting on next release
[2013-09-18 01:28:50] Dave_B_: what language are you working in?
[2013-09-18 01:29:05] juri`: release notes say that operadriver has been updated in 2.35, but why doesn't 2.33 work then? =/
[2013-09-18 01:29:20] juri`: i'm using remotewebdriver in .net
[2013-09-18 01:30:01] Dave_B_: Not sure why 2.33 wouldn't work - I'm using 2.33 and can use Opera. I';m using Opera 12 though, in case that's relevant
[2013-09-18 01:30:07] juri`: but as long as selenium server kept launching IE instead of Opera i went into debugging it with eclipse
[2013-09-18 01:30:41] Dave_B_: 2.35 will keep launching IE, yep.
[2013-09-18 01:30:58] juri`: and found out that it gets ClassNotFoundException when loading operadriver

[2013-09-18 01:56:56] juri`: i started to get it in firefox lately, and now getting in opera as well, but it was gone, when using 2.35
[2013-09-18 01:58:07] Dave_B_: umm I don't really know (there are far more knowledgable people than me in here... probably more knowledgable fish come to that) but I have seen that previously when using incompatible browser versions with a given driver
[2013-09-18 01:58:21] Dave_B_: so e.g. on 2.33 don't go past FF22
[2013-09-18 01:58:57] juri`: now i tried to go to .net libs v 2.35 (while keeping selenium server 2.33) and the test has passed with opera
[2013-09-18 01:59:07] Dave_B_: yay :)
[2013-09-18 02:00:37] juri`: and it seems that Maximizing of browser window is not supported with Opera
[2013-09-18 02:00:51] Dave_B_: indeed nhot, no browser resizing :(
[2013-09-18 02:00:51] juri`: that's bad, but i think i can live with that
[2013-09-18 02:00:58] Dave_B_: youy can send it f11 if you like
[2013-09-18 02:01:32] Dave_B_: if you've responsive design or something and need it to be bigger than a certain cutoff
[2013-09-18 02:01:39] Dave_B_: not very elegant though :(
[2013-09-18 02:02:01] Dave_B_: (and remember that you may be un-fullscreening it if you do this at the start of each test!)

[2013-09-18 06:03:19] jusfreeman: the screen on the Android device goes white when I run the test, so it looks like selenium is sending it the session. Plus in the Android log cat, I can see logs like "Creating new session for Capabilities...."
[2013-09-18 06:05:07] Dave_B_: whats the remoteHost line for? I'm confused by it being localhost:8080 same as host, seems like a port conflict in my head
[2013-09-18 06:07:25] ddary: the android emulator and the computer have two separated networks
[2013-09-18 06:07:46] Dave_B_: ahh
[2013-09-18 06:07:49] Dave_B_: makes sense now :)

[2013-09-18 06:32:56] jeffszusz: what would I do if I wanted to manually copy what the 'sendKeys()' method does? does it click first? just hover? does it just change the 'value' of the element?
[2013-09-18 06:35:04] jimevans: jeffszusz: it depends on whether you're using so-called "native events" or not.
[2013-09-18 06:35:35] jeffszusz: what is a "native event" and what's the alternative? we're using geb and spock
[2013-09-18 06:37:05] juri`, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-18 06:37:06] jimevans: so each browser driver has different, unique methods for simulating user input, based on the "best" method for doing so for each browser. "native events" (which are preferred when possible) simulate user input via os-level mechanisms, contrasted with "simulated events", which use javascript exclusively.
[2013-09-18 06:37:22] jeffszusz: ok
[2013-09-18 06:37:26] jeffszusz: so we're using chromedriver
[2013-09-18 06:38:00] jimevans: so chromedriver isn't actually developed by the selenium development team; it
[2013-09-18 06:38:12] jimevans: it's created and maintained by the chromium team
[2013-09-18 06:38:29] jimevans: i'm not entirely sure what mechanism they use for sending keystrokes.
[2013-09-18 06:38:45] jeffszusz: hm
[2013-09-18 06:39:23] juri`: why the same code may work with SafariDriver on win7 x64, but may not work on win XP x86? WebDriver client doesn't see to get connection to Safari extension, even though extension gets installed properly
[2013-09-18 06:39:35] juri`: seem*

[2013-09-18 06:39:42] jimevans: i'd have to jump into the chromium source code in order to figure out what they're doing.
[2013-09-18 06:40:28] jeffszusz: i see
[2013-09-18 06:41:30] jeffszusz: I'm just trying to figure out this test someone wrote - they're sending an element a TAB key, as if to tab away from it, but that element has no focus anyway at that point so i'm not sure what it's doing before actually sending the TAB

[2013-09-18 07:00:34] jimevans: you also shouldn't need to worry about the extension if you're using a relatively recent version of language bindings.
[2013-09-18 07:00:51] jimevans: (the language bindings should handle installing the extension for you)
[2013-09-18 07:00:52] juri`: i'm using .net
[2013-09-18 07:01:06] juri`: does it have the extension as well?
[2013-09-18 07:01:09] jimevans: yep. the .net bindings should install the extension for yoyu.

[2013-09-18 07:11:36] jimevans: note that this is using the bindings downloaded from the googlecode page, not attempting to build the bindings myself.

[2013-09-18 14:19:36] barancev|2: yes, I'd expect the click() works after this moveTo() :)

[2013-09-18 14:21:16] barancev|2: I'm working with firefox atm, not sure about others
[2013-09-18 14:22:06] jimevans: just asking. i know there's specific code in the IE driver to detect the "link" case to prevent wrapping, and i think it's invoked for actions too.
[2013-09-18 14:22:34] AutomatedTester: jimevans: found the bug that made my interop patch burn
[2013-09-18 14:22:41] AutomatedTester: FYI
[2013-09-18 14:22:49] jimevans: groovy!
[2013-09-18 14:22:57] barancev|2: jimevans: why links only?
[2013-09-18 14:23:10] barancev|2: what if I have a span with onclick handler?
[2013-09-18 14:23:18] jimevans: well, not really links. it's inline elements.
[2013-09-18 14:23:29] AutomatedTester: barancev|2: then clicking anywhere in the span should fire that event
[2013-09-18 14:23:56] barancev|2: such a span will consis of several rectangles too
[2013-09-18 14:24:07] barancev|2: any inline element, as jimevans told

[2013-09-18 14:30:04] jimevans: but in practice, it works out to <a> and <span>, because for the other inline elements, either no one tries to locate them (like the formatting elements <strong> or <b>) or they don't break on lines (like <input> or <button> or <textarea>)
[2013-09-18 14:30:58] barancev|2: yes, a and span are most frequently used ones
[2013-09-18 14:31:36] barancev|2: and firefox-native can't deal with wrapped spans even in the case of span.click()

[2013-09-18 15:04:55] jimevans: using sendmessage to simulate user input is a BadThing™, and should never be used by anybody on windows.
[2013-09-18 15:05:26] jleyba: Hmmm.. so requireWindowFocus actually moves the mouse?
[2013-09-18 15:05:57] jimevans: no, it uses the SendInput api, which injects events into the system-level keyboard and mouse event queues.
[2013-09-18 15:06:10] jimevans: which is why the window has to have focus.
[2013-09-18 15:06:34] jimevans: because whatever window is in the foreground will get those messages from the system input queues.
