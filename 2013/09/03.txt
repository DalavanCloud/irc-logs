[2013-09-03 03:32:46] jawr: i wanted to be able to detect when an event has been fired, but doesn't executeScript expect a dom element to be returned
[2013-09-03 03:32:48] simonstewart: I'm not sure what that sentence means, jawr. Can you please elaborate a bit?
[2013-09-03 03:33:04] simonstewart: jawr: take a look at executeAsyncEvent
[2013-09-03 03:33:09] jawr: aha
[2013-09-03 03:33:37] jawr: async script?
[2013-09-03 03:34:35] simonstewart: Well, it depends on what you're trying to do
[2013-09-03 03:34:45] simonstewart: If you're checking to see whether an interaction causes an event to fire
[2013-09-03 03:34:55] simonstewart: add a listener for the event using a normal "executeScript"
[2013-09-03 03:35:04] simonstewart: then cause the event to fire via an interaction
[2013-09-03 03:35:08] simonstewart: (a click? sendKeys?)
[2013-09-03 03:35:12] jawr: sure
[2013-09-03 03:35:19] simonstewart: Then check the result from your listener using executeScript
[2013-09-03 03:35:34] jimpurbrick, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-03 03:35:35] simonstewart: (which implies you store the result in some global or readily available variable)
[2013-09-03 03:36:12] jawr: so perhaps something like: execute_script("$(document).on('event'), function() { return someObj; }")
[2013-09-03 03:36:18] jawr: then fire the event off with my click
[2013-09-03 03:36:37] jawr: then afterwards poll the return of the execute_script to see if it actually retusn anything
[2013-09-03 03:36:45] simonstewart: Nope
[2013-09-03 03:36:47] simonstewart: Something like:
[2013-09-03 03:37:18] simonstewart: execute_script("$(document).on('event'), function() { document.yourMagicVar = true; }")
[2013-09-03 03:37:21] simonstewart: Then fire the event
[2013-09-03 03:37:29] simonstewart: Then check "document.yourMagicVar"
[2013-09-03 03:38:26] jawr: i wanted to try avoid writing variables, but it makes sense

[2013-09-03 04:30:49] barancev: it's a jmeter plugin

[2013-09-03 04:39:07] ajaykools: So i can automate whole page and get load test result (memory used by Apache and MYSQL)

[2013-09-03 07:35:23] barancev: I have a piece of good news
[2013-09-03 07:35:32] gdennis: great
[2013-09-03 07:35:49] barancev: I know why testShouldScrollOverflowElementsIfClickPointIsOutOfViewButElementIsInView fails
[2013-09-03 07:36:21] barancev: bot.action.scrollIntoView "underscrolls" the target element by ~20px
[2013-09-03 07:36:29] gdennis: scrollbar width?
[2013-09-03 07:37:53] gdennis: on Friday, before I left the office for our long weekend, I found the same thing, figuring it to be the width of the bottom scrollbar
[2013-09-03 07:38:35] gdennis: and then started to investigate whether I could reliably calculate the width and account for it
[2013-09-03 07:39:10] gdennis: barancev: unless you think there's another cause of the ~20px underscrolling?
[2013-09-03 07:40:21] barancev: gdennis: I've compared the "scrolled" position before the patch and after it
[2013-09-03 07:41:12] barancev: 17px, to be precise
[2013-09-03 07:42:00] barancev: may be it's the saise of scollbar, I don't know, I just compared and found there is a difference

[2013-09-03 07:54:20] jimevans: yeah, in IE there was an assumption that a vertical scrollbar was always present, because in most cases it is. so if a page took pains to remove the vertical scroll bar, the calculation of whether an element was "in view" or not would be incorrect, because the width would be incorrect, which meant we'd inadvertently assume there was a horizontal scroll bar.

[2013-09-03 08:51:11] nirvdrum: jimevans: You probably know, but the approach to ensuring a clean session in IEDriver doesn't work in IE 6.

[2013-09-03 09:28:37] dimacus: has anyone seen this odd bug on browser.navigate.to (java equivalent), when from time to time, if navigate_to is called in middle of the test (instead of clicking a link to navigate to another page) the method will not wait for the new page to fully load
[2013-09-03 09:30:01] dimacus: i think i have a way to test it, but not 100% sure if i'm digging into a bug that has already been researched to death and solved
[2013-09-03 09:30:53] Dude-X: dimacus: the navigate to call has rudimentary waiting
[2013-09-03 09:31:21] Dude-X: basically it will wait for the throbber to stop spinning or when document.ready is ready

[2013-09-03 09:36:04] dimacus: 1) Navigate to is called
[2013-09-03 09:36:25] dimacus: 2) before naviagte is called we get current_url from browsers and store it
[2013-09-03 09:36:41] dimacus: 3) after page.ready is called, check if URL has changed
[2013-09-03 09:37:15] dimacus: 4) if changed next step, if stayed the same wait a little longer, if timeout, error "expected to move to different url but current url did not change"
[2013-09-03 09:38:41] dimacus: i have several tests that keep on failing b/c the previous page is still spinning waiting to load and new page has not loaded yet… but webdriver releases the hold and the test starts to do assertions

[2013-09-03 09:48:20] Dude-X: dimacus: sometimes the URL doesn't change.
[2013-09-03 09:48:45] Dude-X: due to link rewriting
[2013-09-03 09:49:05] jleyba: dimacus: what browser are you having trouble with?
[2013-09-03 09:49:05] dimacus: dang… what other possible ways to solve this?
[2013-09-03 09:49:20] Dude-X: generally, you should know the characteristics of how the page loads
[2013-09-03 09:49:29] Dude-X: then wait for that element to be visible
[2013-09-03 09:49:37] Dude-X: the last element that is modified
[2013-09-03 09:49:42] Dude-X: or added.
[2013-09-03 09:49:55] dimacus: you are assuming that you have a page object framework of some sort ;)
[2013-09-03 09:50:04] jleyba: if you're expecting a new page to load you can
[2013-09-03 09:50:05] Dude-X: yes….
[2013-09-03 09:50:13] jleyba: 1) wait for an element on the old page to disappear
[2013-09-03 09:50:20] jleyba: 2) wait for an element on the new page to become present
[2013-09-03 09:52:06] dimacus: yeah true… however, that would mean modifying every test ever written… i guess i'm trying to figure out a way to fix the "rudimentary waits" in the navigate method
[2013-09-03 09:52:51] jleyba: The navigate method doesn't have waits per se
[2013-09-03 09:53:00] dimacus: just feels wrong that sometimes webdriver let's it go to new step even though the page is still obviously loading, and the spinner spinning…
[2013-09-03 09:53:20] jleyba: ok... what browser?
[2013-09-03 09:53:21] dimacus: oh? we how does it know that the page is fully loaded before letting the next method call to go through?
[2013-09-03 09:53:23] dimacus: FF
[2013-09-03 09:53:39] dimacus: FF17 and FF23
[2013-09-03 09:54:01] jleyba: hahaha.. the network activity in FF is such a pain in the ass
[2013-09-03 09:54:12] dimacus: and again, i'm chasing down 1/100 situation here… and simplest solution is to add a sleep
[2013-09-03 09:54:13] jleyba: I'll grab a link for the relevant files if you're interested in hacking on it :)
[2013-09-03 09:54:17] dimacus: but sheesh i feel bad about it

[2013-09-03 09:57:24] jleyba: ok, so two basic parts to the navigate command
[2013-09-03 09:57:42] jleyba: 1) it loads the new page then tries to detect when it has finished loading before returning a response to the client
[2013-09-03 09:57:54] dimacus: aha
[2013-09-03 09:57:57] Dude-X: dimacus: fyi,, sometimes i do find navigate a bit flaky, not switching the page properly...
[2013-09-03 09:58:14] Dude-X: but that was a year ago.
[2013-09-03 09:58:22] jleyba: 2) on every command, the FF driver checks if there is new network activity and will hold off on executing the command until the activity is done
[2013-09-03 09:58:43] dimacus: Dude-X:  i found a perfect test that fails often enough to verify a concrete fix… that's why i bring this up, to squash and confirm fix :)

[2013-09-03 11:11:25] stevegross: Hi folks.
[2013-09-03 11:12:06] stevegross: I'm running into an issue that I *think* is specific to the firefox-winxp client on Selenium 2.34. Would like some guidance, if that's possible...
[2013-09-03 11:12:19] manoj9788: Attended PyCon India this weekend.. It was Nice. Got to meet Kenneth Reitz and many others.
[2013-09-03 11:14:21] jleyba: in java, suppose i have "private final InnerClassFoo foo = new InnerClassFoo();"
[2013-09-03 11:14:48] jimevans: stevegross: what's happening?
[2013-09-03 11:14:51] jleyba: what could cause foo to not maintain proper references to the outer class's members?
[2013-09-03 11:14:57] stevegross: Ok, here's the situation:
[2013-09-03 11:15:11] stevegross: Consider this URL: https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&tbm=shop&q=altoids&oq=altoids&gs_l=products-cc.3..0l10.2201.2583.0.2644.7.5.0.0.0.0.117.412.3j2.5.0...0.0...1ac.1.ASFsOFI8kF4
[2013-09-03 11:15:30] stevegross: If you click on the first search result ("ALtoids..."), it takes you here: https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11348055498800560761?hl=en&q=altoids&oq=altoids&sa=X&ei=KScmUpHeIai2sAS8xIDgBw&ved=0CFsQ8wIwAA
[2013-09-03 11:15:44] stevegross: On firefox-winxp, OCCASIONALLY that operation will timeout.
[2013-09-03 11:15:58] stevegross: By timeout, I mean it goes for ~5 minutes and then our test mechanism forcibly kills the test.
[2013-09-03 11:16:18] stevegross: The stacktrace shows that the code is dealing with some HTTP read-from-buffer work.
[2013-09-03 11:16:29] stevegross: This does not happen all the time, but maybe 1-out-of-15 times.
[2013-09-03 11:16:50] stevegross: I'm wondering if there's a bug in the firefox-winxp driver that specifically deals with reading-from-buffer.
[2013-09-03 11:16:59] stevegross: I can give more detailed stacktrace info if you want.
[2013-09-03 11:17:47] jleyba: It's just a standard apache http client
[2013-09-03 11:18:11] stevegross: Yeah, I figured that at that level there's nothing browser-specific going on.
[2013-09-03 11:18:17] stevegross: However, this only happens on firefox-winxp.
[2013-09-03 11:18:27] stevegross: So there has to be SOMETHING browser-specific causing the problem.
[2013-09-03 11:18:40] jleyba: Well, the firefox driver is implemented as a browser extension
[2013-09-03 11:19:23] jleyba: have you tried pausing the test and checking Firefox's error console?
[2013-09-03 11:19:42] stevegross: No, but that sounds like a reasonable idea.
[2013-09-03 11:19:48] jleyba: there could be an error preventing the driver from writing a response back to the client
[2013-09-03 11:20:10] stevegross: I'm only seeing this problem in production, in a situation in which I would not be able to examine Firefox in that way, though.
[2013-09-03 11:20:21] stevegross: I suppose I could run it locally and examine the console.
[2013-09-03 11:20:26] stevegross: Would that be useful?

[2013-09-03 12:03:53] Evanlec: so I have a "carousel" widget that normally auto-scrolls as long as mouse isn't hovering on it...but during my selenium test run, even if I use "move_to_element" method to move the cursor away, the widget refuses to scroll as normal...I'm using time.sleep(60) to wait 60 seconds and still nothing
[2013-09-03 12:05:09] Evanlec: could the sleep function be holding things up? seems unlikely as im running on a remote grid, the browser should still be executing its own javascript

However,  by adding browser.current_url the issue stops happening at all. I'm wondering if explicitly asking to get the current url buys it some extra time to finish loading or something
[2013-09-03 12:30:00] jleyba: dimacus: yes
[2013-09-03 12:30:02] jleyba: it does
[2013-09-03 12:30:22] jleyba: each time a command is received, the FirefoxDriver checks if the browser is loading a new page
[2013-09-03 12:30:28] dregin, quitting. (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[2013-09-03 12:30:44] jleyba: so if get(url) returned too early, the getCurrentUrl() will make it wait for the load
[2013-09-03 12:31:12] barancev: gdennis: eagerly waiting for your fix
[2013-09-03 12:31:24] Evanlec: barancev: ah its the twitter bootstrap carousel: seen here: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#carousel
[2013-09-03 12:32:02] dimacus: jleyba:  ok so once in a while… the get() calls isLoadExpected() which accidently returns a false
[2013-09-03 12:32:19] jleyba: probably
[2013-09-03 12:32:21] dimacus: now to figure out why isLoadidExpected() gets confused
[2013-09-03 12:32:44] dimacus: or.. cheat and brut force it by asking for getUrl() at the end of each get()
