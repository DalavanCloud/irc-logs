[2013-09-09 08:38:33] Prometheian: My test opens a window where there's a table. If you click on any part of one of the rows, it counts that as a choice and closes itself and sends the choice to the main window. However, for some reason, my test keeps failing even though it's clicking where it needs to. Line 87. http://www.hastebin.com/qevijawali.avrasm Anyone mind taking a peek to see why it might be doing so?
[2013-09-09 08:38:54] jimevans: barancev: parameters should be passed as the value of the "parameters" property in the json object sent across the wire.
[2013-09-09 08:39:05] dimacus: anyone know of a firefox plugin that will take console log and dump it into file?
[2013-09-09 08:39:12] dimacus: error log etc..
[2013-09-09 08:39:16] dimacus: info
[2013-09-09 08:39:25] barancev: jimevans: got it, thanks
[2013-09-09 08:40:45] asavchuk: dimacus: fxdriver? :)
[2013-09-09 08:41:36] dimacus: yeah… basically there seems to be a bug with the console log command line arg
[2013-09-09 08:41:41] dimacus: that it does not actually save to file
[2013-09-09 08:42:08] dimacus: asavchuk:  webdriver.log.file this flag is broken, so i'm looking for an alternative
[2013-09-09 08:42:20] dimacus: like an FF add on that just dumps things to file
[2013-09-09 08:42:22] asavchuk: dimacus: oh! it's broken of course
[2013-09-09 08:42:31] dimacus: of course?
[2013-09-09 08:42:34] asavchuk: dimacus: use webdriver.log.driver.file
[2013-09-09 08:42:40] asavchuk: :)
[2013-09-09 08:43:06] asavchuk: webdriver.log.(driver|browser|?).(file|level)
[2013-09-09 08:43:22] dimacus: asavchuk:  so will that be log from the driver or from JS console log?
[2013-09-09 08:43:55] asavchuk: driver log contains messages from driver. browser log - from browser
[2013-09-09 08:44:00] asavchuk: as i know.

[2013-09-09 08:45:53] dimacus: thank you sir… this should help me to chase down a JS bug in FF driver core, and hopefully fix it

[2013-09-09 11:31:30] jimevans: Prometheian: the name property added when window.open() is called.
[2013-09-09 11:31:52] Prometheian: What if the new window is generated by the webpage?
[2013-09-09 11:32:01] jimevans: then use window handles.
[2013-09-09 11:32:18] Prometheian: Window name is a no-go in that scenario?
[2013-09-09 11:32:44] jleyba: if you know it, use it
[2013-09-09 11:32:45] jimevans: not necessarily. you'd need to know what window was supplied (if any) by the webpage when it calls window.open()

[2013-09-09 11:53:35] jimevans: okay, so you've verified the list count by something like system.out.println(driver.getWindowHandles().getSize()), right?
[2013-09-09 11:53:41] Prometheian: yes
[2013-09-09 11:53:47] jimevans: okay, great.
[2013-09-09 11:54:10] jimevans: now, inside your loop, see if you can get the title of each driver.
[2013-09-09 11:54:20] Prometheian: I'm unsure how to get a window's title from it's handle.

It's just a simple web entry of some text into two form fields and hitting submit.

[2013-09-09 12:09:53] patarr: eeh im not well versed at debugging python yet. and it seems the exception is coming from within the webdriver itself.
[2013-09-09 12:10:45] phasze: yeah, that will come from webdriver because it's trying to do something with an element it can't find.
[2013-09-09 12:11:27] phasze: so maybe you're trying to sendkeys or click on something you think it there but isn't.  Like maybe your page isn't loaded yet.

[2013-09-09 12:39:03] jimevans: yeah, there are a few issues, but i think most of them are already captured in the bug list.
[2013-09-09 12:39:08] jimevans: like submit doesn't work
[2013-09-09 12:39:49] jimevans: scrolling elements into view doesn't work very well. :)
[2013-09-09 12:40:07] jimevans: but again, this stuff isn't directly related to your change.

[2013-09-09 12:40:36] jimevans: yeah. one funny one is returning a list of elements from javascript.
[2013-09-09 12:41:04] jimevans: marionette returns an object, rather than an array.
[2013-09-09 12:41:08] OS-10583: got a bit of "curious" issues related to selenium on web application with .NET
[2013-09-09 12:41:14] AutomatedTester: jimevans: which one?
[2013-09-09 12:41:25] jimevans: AutomatedTester: give me a second.

[2013-09-09 12:42:29] OS-10583: why does selenium record duplicate username and password fields when i try to record the login
[2013-09-09 12:42:57] patarr: phasze: my script completely executes correctly but I still get a not found element message. Is that some sort of weird quirk?
[2013-09-09 12:42:58] jimevans: OS-10583: by "record", are you using Selenium IDE (the firefox plugin)?
[2013-09-09 12:43:09] OS-10583: also, it seems it's omitting the username/password fields from sending them in other hidden fields
[2013-09-09 12:43:23] OS-10583: yes, selenium IDE 2.3.0 on firefox on ubuntu 12.04
[2013-09-09 12:43:26] phasze: patarr: nope, sounds like something didn't execute correcly.

[2013-09-09 12:43:50] phasze: patarr: if you think it all ran good it may have even been the last command.
[2013-09-09 12:44:01] patarr: but it worked well! lol
[2013-09-09 12:44:07] jimevans: OS-10583: well, i'm going to be singularly unable to help with that. my (strongly negative) feelings about selenium ide are on record.
[2013-09-09 12:44:20] OS-10583: i can handover the url of the site just to try out
[2013-09-09 12:44:33] OS-10583: no wait, i don't think that's wise (this is being recorded)
[2013-09-09 12:45:27] OS-10583: jimevans: you know if selenium has been tested with a .net web application?  those things could be really annoying
[2013-09-09 12:45:38] tourdedave, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-09 12:46:12] OS-10583: i compare payloads between what selenium sends
[2013-09-09 12:46:20] OS-10583: and what the browser sends
[2013-09-09 12:46:23] OS-10583: here's one sample
[2013-09-09 12:46:34] OS-10583: $txtPassword=1234&ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_txtPassword_ClientState={"enabled":true,"emptyMessage":"Password","validationText":"","valueAsString":""}

[2013-09-09 12:47:08] OS-10583: first is with selenium, second is with firefox alone
[2013-09-09 12:47:16] OS-10583: notice the "1234" in the field

[2013-09-09 12:51:12] OS-10583: wait a minute
[2013-09-09 12:51:36] OS-10583: i missed the part where you said you didn't like the ide
[2013-09-09 12:51:51] jimevans: OS-10583: i just abhor the RC api, and keep myself deliberately ignorant of it. similarly i believe record/playback to be a flawed paradigm for long-term success of automation efforts, so i remain ignorant of that too.
[2013-09-09 12:51:54] OS-10583: what would be the alternative to write a nice selenium script
[2013-09-09 12:53:10] jimevans: visual studio using the webdriver .net bindings? eclipse/intellij using the webdriver java bindings? any text editor using the webdriver ruby or python bindings? any of those i'd use. :)
[2013-09-09 12:53:13] OS-10583: jimevans: i'll have to agree, i do stress testing and recording never helped me out by itself
[2013-09-09 12:53:45] barancev: AutomatedTester: is something fixed from this list? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bcQKwXD8pTEggsdPVM3LA23eVdQdHDtkm7GHFMUeWN4/edit?usp=sharing
[2013-09-09 12:54:14] OS-10583: jimavans: thanks, so i can use python to generate a selenium script ?
[2013-09-09 12:54:50] jimevans: "generate" is a hazy word for me, but you can write a webdriver script using python, yes.

[2013-09-09 13:12:34] barancev: can it be the reason?
[2013-09-09 13:12:40] AutomatedTester: ?
[2013-09-09 13:12:53] barancev: the reader that reads data from the socket
[2013-09-09 13:13:00] barancev: connection to marionette
[2013-09-09 13:14:09] AutomatedTester: so you read the response and then it dies?
[2013-09-09 13:14:46] barancev: yes
[2013-09-09 13:14:51] AutomatedTester: weird
[2013-09-09 13:14:59] AutomatedTester: that should be rock solid code
[2013-09-09 13:15:06] AutomatedTester: jimevans: are you seeing that too?

[2013-09-09 13:16:10] jimevans: AutomatedTester: no, i'm good. i'm not seeing any crashes at all. although i did add some robustness code in my .NET implementation to handle subsequent calls to quit().
[2013-09-09 13:16:12] AutomatedTester: OS-10583: different APIs

[2013-09-09 13:16:34] jleyba: OS-10583: one of the reasons you should migrate to the webdriver API
[2013-09-09 13:16:38] OS-10583: would it make a difference in form login ?
[2013-09-09 13:16:44] jleyba: depends
[2013-09-09 13:17:21] OS-10583: k,
[2013-09-09 13:17:59] OS-10583: 1.10 seems to record my input as "type"
[2013-09-09 13:18:10] OS-10583: 2.3.0 puts "sendkeys" instead

[2013-09-09 13:21:02] jimevans: the vast bulk of the complexity of the .net marionette driver could be eliminated if moz#819050 were fixed and if the command names and parameter names matched the webdriver wire protocol.
