[2013-09-04 01:55:48] selbot2: 03barancev 4 months ago - Checking a node status when attempting to create a new session. This | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=2edd481 | http://dashboard.ci.seleniumhq.org/#/revision/2edd481c09fe220bd10d4d292eb24069605467f7
[2013-09-04 01:56:22] nirvdrum: Can you better explain why that change was made please?
[2013-09-04 01:57:47] nirvdrum: I'm pretty sure what's happening is that status check is blocking for whatever reason . . . host went down, client thread pool exhausted, etc.
[2013-09-04 01:58:01] barancev: yes, if a node goes to nothing for some reason (a software failure or a network unreachable) it remains registered in the hub, and it attempts to dispatch new session requests to this dead node
[2013-09-04 01:58:49] nirvdrum: But that's called in a synchronized method, which blocks NewSessionRequestQueue.
[2013-09-04 01:58:57] nirvdrum: Which blocks every single request thread to the Jetty server.
[2013-09-04 01:59:07] nirvdrum: I'm able to lock my entire hub up within 30 min.
[2013-09-04 01:59:22] nirvdrum: That clean up needs to happen somewhere else.

[2013-09-04 01:59:32] nirvdrum: This code was pretty thoroughly reviewed for thread safety.
[2013-09-04 01:59:49] barancev: which method is synchronized?
[2013-09-04 02:00:08] nirvdrum: Everything in NewSessionRequestQueue.
[2013-09-04 02:00:18] jamesoram, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-04 02:00:33] nirvdrum: In particular, the call to processQueue ends up blocking everything else.
[2013-09-04 02:01:07] nirvdrum: You can trace it back to Registry#assignRequestToProxy
[2013-09-04 02:01:35] nirvdrum: That predicate ends up calling getNewSession.
[2013-09-04 02:01:54] barancev: so you want to say that call to getStatus() blocks, right?
[2013-09-04 02:02:07] nirvdrum: I want to remove the getStatus call completely.
[2013-09-04 02:02:23] nirvdrum: But, yes, it is blocking.
[2013-09-04 02:02:44] nirvdrum: Even if it all works swimmingly, ios-driver can take 600 ms easily to respond to that status call.
[2013-09-04 02:02:51] nirvdrum: In the meanwhile, that lock is held.
[2013-09-04 02:03:07] barancev: ok, then, we are back to the issue: what to do if a node has gone?
[2013-09-04 02:03:10] nirvdrum: In a small grid, it may not matter much.  But in a remotely medium sized one, that will kill you.
[2013-09-04 02:03:14] evanton, quitting. (Quit: leaving)
[2013-09-04 02:03:29] nirvdrum: We have heartbeats.  We have timeouts.
[2013-09-04 02:04:00] asavchuk: nirvdrum: hm. maybe we need to tune timeout for this operation ? during restarting node it's good to not assign session to restarting node.
[2013-09-04 02:04:00] barancev: the hub does not deregister nodes if they are temporarily unavailable
[2013-09-04 02:04:22] barancev: the hub waits till they are back
[2013-09-04 02:04:42] nirvdrum: As with nearly all distributed systems, there is an expectation the client has the ability to retry requests.
[2013-09-04 02:04:46] asavchuk: or move out this call from sync
[2013-09-04 02:05:09] DrJenkin_, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-04 02:05:45] barancev: I see the point -- checking the status is slow, I agree
[2013-09-04 02:06:23] nirvdrum: I'll have to revisit the heartbeat code.
[2013-09-04 02:06:31] barancev: but we do it only when a node wants to start a new session
[2013-09-04 02:06:36] nirvdrum: I don't recall what grid 2 does differently than grid 1.
[2013-09-04 02:06:38] tobie_, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-04 02:06:57] nirvdrum: I create a crapload of sessions.  And they come almost all at once.
[2013-09-04 02:07:22] nirvdrum: But clients can't even timeout now because there's no way to remove sessions.  The entire thing is just deadlocked.
[2013-09-04 02:07:29] ronny: does anyone have an idea whats wrong if the standalone execution of a selenium suite doesnt find the paths for single testcases?
[2013-09-04 02:08:09] barancev: nirvdrum: ok, you can roll it back, and reopen the issue I tried to fix

[2013-09-04 02:08:56] nirvdrum: I see grid 2 nodes drop out, so I assumed that worked the same way.
[2013-09-04 02:08:56] barancev: and yes I could reproduce it

[2013-09-04 02:10:02] barancev: nirvdrum: where is heartbeat code? I see only "I'm alive requests" from nodes
[2013-09-04 02:10:16] barancev: no activity from the hub side to check nodes availability
[2013-09-04 02:10:18] nirvdrum: The Grid1 heartbeat servlet is there.
[2013-09-04 02:10:31] nirvdrum: That's probably what I'm using, actually.
[2013-09-04 02:10:41] asavchuk: DefaultRemoteProxy#startPolling
[2013-09-04 02:10:50] asavchuk: it is hearbeat i think
[2013-09-04 02:11:02] asavchuk: hub calls getStatus for each node
[2013-09-04 02:12:38] asavchuk: and grid2 now has max count of failed checks before unregistering node too

[2013-09-04 02:26:12] nirvdrum: FWIW, I opened an issue on ios-driver to make the status call faster there.  But if we're assuming grid nodes are unreliable, you have to assume that call can take as long as a timeout.

[2013-09-04 02:27:39] asavchuk: this polling works but it's too slow (even with tuned timeouts) so in result new sessions are assigned to "dead" nodes if hub is under load. but if we have "expectation the client has the ability to retry request" then it's ok
[2013-09-04 02:27:51] zeljkof, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-04 02:28:17] barancev: ok, let's discuss another issue
[2013-09-04 02:28:43] nirvdrum: asavchuk: Couldn't we just catch the exception when forwarding the request, unregister the node, and retry the request on a new proxy?
[2013-09-04 02:28:49] barancev: let's suppose a node has gone, but the timeout is not exceeded
[2013-09-04 02:28:59] nirvdrum: Obviously a bit more complicated because it's a queue.  But it sounds like it would make everyone happy.
[2013-09-04 02:29:25] barancev: should the hub mark it as a "not available" and skip when it needs a node to start a new session?
[2013-09-04 02:29:54] operatiay, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-04 02:30:46] nirvdrum: What do you mean by "it's gone"?  It went away permanently?
[2013-09-04 02:31:02] nirvdrum: We were trying to be resilient towards ephemeral network failures, too.
[2013-09-04 02:31:07] stackedsax, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-09-04 02:31:27] barancev: we (the hub) can't know permanently or temporarily
[2013-09-04 02:31:40] nirvdrum: That's why there's a cycle count.
[2013-09-04 02:31:47] nirvdrum: If it fails a check N times, we evict it.
[2013-09-04 02:31:48] asavchuk: nirvdrum: hm. that means that single failure is enough to unregister node. but polling code uses 2 tries before unregistering and make a wait before it.
[2013-09-04 02:32:07] barancev: what to do while "N times" loop is not completed yet?
[2013-09-04 02:32:21] nirvdrum: asavchuk: I was just laying out a framework.  We could not unregister it, but instead keep a failed session count per proxy.
[2013-09-04 02:32:25] barancev: shuld we consider it as "available for тку sessions" or not?
[2013-09-04 02:32:35] barancev: *new sessions

[2013-09-04 02:33:39] nirvdrum: But, currently we consider it still good.  If you need a tighter threshold, tune your grid timeouts.
[2013-09-04 02:33:52] barancev: btw, why getStatus() blocks and starting a new session does not?

[2013-09-04 06:28:52] Ardesco: it's stable atm
[2013-09-04 06:28:58] Ardesco: but the VN's are not uber powerful
[2013-09-04 06:29:04] Ardesco: VM's even
[2013-09-04 06:29:22] Ardesco: for us it was quicker to load up a couple of AWS Large instances for our IE tests
[2013-09-04 06:29:23] DrJenkins: can you go all in on one of these services are would you say that local machines still are needed?
[2013-09-04 06:29:53] Ardesco: I wouldn't because I want to run my tests on my local machine without access to the net
[2013-09-04 06:29:59] Ardesco: depends on your requirements
[2013-09-04 06:30:38] stackedsax1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-04 06:30:38] Ardesco: the good thing is that Sauce Labs, Testing Bot and BrowserStack all use very similar setups so it's easy to switch between them
[2013-09-04 06:31:15] Ardesco: Personally i've found browserstack to have slightly more powerful VM's, but it's not as mature
[2013-09-04 06:31:29] Ardesco: Sauce have the most bells and whistles
[2013-09-04 06:31:48] DrJenkins: how do you get your tests to the remote machines? can browserstack/saucelabs check out from git to get the latest test code?
[2013-09-04 06:32:02] DrJenkins: and can they monitor a git branch for changes and run tests if it finds an update?

[2013-09-04 06:34:02] Ardesco: it's a grid, so you just configure your tests to use a RemoteWebDriver

[2013-09-04 08:28:02] jimevans: the "return" key is the one above the right-hand shift key; the "enter" key is on the numeric keypad. they send different characters over the wire in the JSON wire protocol.

[2013-09-04 14:28:59] jimevans: if, somewhere down in the javascript that's being called by your delete action, the "popup" that is being displayed is caused by the alert() or confirm() function, you'll want to handle it in webdriver with switchTo().alert().
[2013-09-04 14:28:59] Prometheian: That any more useful?
[2013-09-04 14:29:52] nhirata, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-04 14:30:07] Prometheian: If that's still a no-go I'll just bug the developers Friday.
[2013-09-04 14:30:09] jimevans: no, because although each of those attributes on the elements only has a single javascript line associated with it, each of those could be calling hundreds or thousands of other lines of javascript code.
[2013-09-04 14:30:30] jimevans: but try switchTo().alert() and see if that helps.
