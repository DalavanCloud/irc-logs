[2013-09-10 07:03:14] barancev: simonstewart: re: InvalidSelectorException -- do you think we should check validity of all kinds of locators?
[2013-09-10 07:03:25] simonstewart: If we can
[2013-09-10 07:03:38] barancev: id, name, classname, tagName
[2013-09-10 07:03:40] simonstewart: But I've seen xpaths get mangled the worst
[2013-09-10 07:03:50] simonstewart: xpath and css seem like the main candidates
[2013-09-10 07:03:57] simonstewart: I've not seen the others get screwed up

[2013-09-10 07:04:11] barancev: xpath and css are validated by the browser
[2013-09-10 07:04:48] barancev: id, name are not
[2013-09-10 07:04:56] CaptainHeavy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-10 07:05:11] barancev: and findElement(By.id("")) throws NoSuchElementException
[2013-09-10 07:05:54] barancev: should we aim to throw more specific InvalidSelectorException for this case?
[2013-09-10 07:06:14] simonstewart: Have you seen that in the wild?
[2013-09-10 07:06:54] barancev: yes, I met it in the wild, and that inspired my quesion ;)
[2013-09-10 07:07:09] Dude-X: I suppose throwing invalidSelectoException would only help people who dynamically generate the id string
[2013-09-10 07:07:18] simonstewart: biab
[2013-09-10 07:07:35] barancev: Dude-X: that was exactly the case
[2013-09-10 07:07:49] barancev: non-static locators
[2013-09-10 07:08:32] Dude-X: i would +1 that change.
[2013-09-10 07:08:42] andreastt: That's not a bad idea, I think.
[2013-09-10 07:09:02] andreastt: As long as we can detect that the locator is wrong, which I guess we might be able to do in some cases.
[2013-09-10 07:09:07] AutomatedTester: jimevans: no

[2013-09-10 07:09:36] Dude-X: but i also feel that it hurts my consistency metric; but i think that being helpful to developers is always better
[2013-09-10 07:09:45] ddary: barancev: i like InvalidSelectorException
[2013-09-10 07:09:48] jimevans: AutomatedTester: in other news, any movement on a marionette language binding repository?
[2013-09-10 07:10:25] barancev: I like InvalidSelectorException too
[2013-09-10 07:11:05] barancev: but selenium (or browser) validates only xpath and css locators
[2013-09-10 07:11:47] Dude-X: i suppose that making it work for every kind of locator is a good thing, passing an empty string is never an intended result

[2013-09-10 07:37:33] monk12|2: if i do driver.findElement(By.id("question2")); just by itself on a line. and i have the implicit wait set for 30s... will it wait 30s until that line can find the element or do i need to add a Wait.until with that findElement
[2013-09-10 07:38:12] monk12|2: I been using wait.until's only for dynamic elements to show up. but thought since there is an implicit wait i could just do that.
[2013-09-10 07:40:07] monk12|2: my scenarios is 2 pages right after each page that just click the 'next' button. so i had 'driver.findElement(By.name("next_btn")).click();' but i was worried it may just click the same button element twice on the same page, so wanted to add a specific check for text/ or another input on the page (which i could do with a wait.until)...
[2013-09-10 07:40:38] monk12|2: but thought maybe a standalone line (driver.findElement(By.id("question2")); ) might wait to find that element to be found before going to the next line of code.

[2013-09-10 08:47:12] AutomatedTester: add a listener for DOMContentLoaded
[2013-09-10 08:47:17] AutomatedTester: that fires when onLoad fires

[2013-09-10 08:47:37] AutomatedTester: or if you know jquery thats when ready() fires

[2013-09-10 08:48:42] dimacus: yeah i'm trying to go back and fix a bug in ffdriver, it seems that the "delay" loop miss fires every once in a while and thinks the page is fully loaded while it is still mid-flight… just want that bug fixed b/c it's driving me crazy :)

[2013-09-10 11:22:55] nirvdrum: lukeis: Which is kinda horeshit.  The idea behind being salaried is sick time isn't supposed to be a tracked thing.  Just as you don't demand overtime when working more than 40 hours.

[2013-09-10 12:23:20] patarr: But I know I have the issue of how to check the value of the text inside an INPUT tag because it appears as though the function I'm using does not check that. Most likely looks at what's between two P tags or something. I need to check the text inside an INPUT. Is there a way I can do that?
[2013-09-10 12:23:34] andreastt: barancev: Always lower case, or what the browser returns?
[2013-09-10 12:23:59] cgoldberg: patarr, locate the element... get it's .text property?
[2013-09-10 12:24:10] jimevans: patarr: that's because the text inside an <input> tag isn't text inside the tag, it's the value of the "value" attribute.
[2013-09-10 12:24:27] andreastt: I'm not sure what locator.tagName returns.
[2013-09-10 12:24:33] patarr: cgoldberg: would it be as simple as elementobject.text == string?
[2013-09-10 12:24:58] davidlai, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-09-10 12:24:58] cgoldberg: .. or as jimevans said... value of value attribute
[2013-09-10 12:25:05] barancev: oops! there is no getTagName in the standard!
[2013-09-10 12:25:20] patarr: jimevans: thanks! I believe there's an expected condition for that. Exactly what I need.
[2013-09-10 12:26:13] jimevans: yep. text_to_be_present_in_element_value.
[2013-09-10 12:26:18] barancev: AutomatedTester: jimevans: why getTagNames is not specified? forgotten? or?
[2013-09-10 12:26:51] jimevans: barancev: damned if i know. probably just an oversight.
[2013-09-10 12:30:35] barancev: andreastt: it is not specified, but all the current drivers return lowercased tag names
[2013-09-10 12:31:06] barancev: iirc, IE returns uppercase tag names, but IE driver returns them lowercase
[2013-09-10 12:31:14] andreastt: barancev: Okay, I'll patch that in the next release.
[2013-09-10 12:31:26] andreastt: barancev: I feel its worth pointing out that this should be standardized.
[2013-09-10 12:31:37] andreastt: barancev: Saying “whatever the browser returns” is fine by me.
[2013-09-10 12:31:43] andreastt: If only that.
[2013-09-10 12:31:50] barancev: or, may be we should instead document this
[2013-09-10 12:32:06] andreastt: Yup.

[2013-09-10 12:44:51] andreastt: yes.
[2013-09-10 12:45:03] andreastt: Definitely not milliseconds like in all other languages.
[2013-09-10 12:45:15] andreastt: </3 python
[2013-09-10 12:45:39] jimevans: AutomatedTester: so the python marionette client has a hard-coded 5 second sleep in it when starting a new session?
[2013-09-10 12:46:07] jimevans: or am i reading this wrong? http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/efc53394043e/testing/marionette/client/marionette/marionette.py#l537

[2013-09-10 12:46:45] jimevans: or andreastt, feel free to look. you'll be needing that code soon enough :)
[2013-09-10 12:48:44] andreastt: Uh, this code is wierd on multiple levels.
[2013-09-10 12:49:11] mreedell_, quitting. (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[2013-09-10 12:50:13] mreedell-work, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-10 12:50:19] andreastt: So it's specifying 3000 seconds keyword argument to timedelta, which means 50 minutes; then it's doing swallowing of exceptions and a five seconds sleep before returning a successful session.
[2013-09-10 12:50:24] andreastt: wtf.
[2013-09-10 12:53:09] jimevans: as i read it, it's polling for the existence of a socket, and looking to get some reply back from it. when it gets a response containing the string "from" (quotes include), it waits for 5 seconds then returns that it found the socket.
[2013-09-10 12:53:31] jimevans: but i'm not the world's best python programmer, so i may be missing something.
[2013-09-10 12:53:32] andreastt: That's how I read it too.
[2013-09-10 12:53:53] jimevans: oh, and it closes the socket too, once it finds it.
[2013-09-10 12:54:01] andreastt: And it does that every second until it's able to connect.
[2013-09-10 12:54:02] barancev: right, I've implemented 5 sec sleep in Java client too
[2013-09-10 12:54:33] andreastt: Which I guess explains the implicit swallowing of exceptions.
[2013-09-10 12:54:39] barancev: because marionette allows connection bit too early
[2013-09-10 12:54:56] md--, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2013-09-10 12:55:00] barancev: you have to wait 2-3 seconds before sending commands
[2013-09-10 12:55:02] jimevans: i can only imagine that when the connection is closed on the portion of marionette that runs inside firefox, it resets the connection, because when a new session is initiated, it looks for that handshake all over again.
[2013-09-10 12:55:31] andreastt: Yes, that seems logical.  Althought not very thread-safe.
[2013-09-10 12:56:00] jimevans: it would be interesting to know why that is.
[2013-09-10 12:56:06] jimevans: (for both things)
[2013-09-10 12:56:11] andreastt: There isn't any explicit closing of the socket in this function.
[2013-09-10 12:56:17] andreastt: Which is somewhat scary.
[2013-09-10 12:56:24] jimevans: sock.close() doesn't do it?
[2013-09-10 12:56:39] andreastt: Oh, sorry, I missed that.
[2013-09-10 12:56:40] *jimevans doesn't know the python socket lib'
[2013-09-10 12:56:59] andreastt: But if sock.connect() fails for other reasons than being able to connect you're in trouble.
[2013-09-10 12:57:22] andreastt: Not that I know the socket library extensively either.  Personally I'd put it in a finally block.
[2013-09-10 12:57:26] jimevans: yeah, you'll sit and spin until the timeout.
[2013-09-10 12:58:31] jimevans: it'd be really nice to eliminate that hard-coded delay. i wonder what needs initializing inside firefox that requires it.

[2013-09-10 13:52:24] cgoldberg: Cheekio, hit it with an http request first.. outside of selenium
[2013-09-10 13:52:24] Cheekio: Or is selenium for testing that your wholistic 'site' works, and I'm asking the wrong questions?
[2013-09-10 13:52:53] cgoldberg: Cheekio, it's used for driving a browser.. you can adapt that to do whatever you want
[2013-09-10 13:53:49] cgoldberg: Cheekio, if you have an expected result when hitting your site (not an http status code).. you can use selenium to get that state and then assert it

[2013-09-10 13:55:21] Cheekio: alright, so I can think of tag names that will always be on the main page
[2013-09-10 13:55:39] Cheekio: or a user is logged in
[2013-09-10 13:55:42] cgoldberg: Cheekio, you can also use absence of elements
[2013-09-10 13:55:48] Cheekio: but I guess asking for the <title> tag is important

[2013-09-10 21:00:23] lukeis: that's a good post too ;)
[2013-09-10 21:00:30] stephend: https://blog.mozilla.org/webqa/2012/07/12/webdrivers-implicit-wait-and-deleting-elements/
[2013-09-10 21:00:50] edrob: I have an implicit wait set at the top level of my hierachy, it seems to work with Firefox pretty consistently, but we had to drop other browsers
[2013-09-10 21:00:55] stephend: indeed, both are -- we went through the conversion in less than 6 months or so, iirc
[2013-09-10 21:02:19] edrob: I will read both articles now, thanks
[2013-09-10 21:03:15] lukeis: edrob: i'm taking a look at it, you say you're using Firefox? and which button, the 'New Post' at the top or the 'Post a Need' in the page?
[2013-09-10 21:03:26] Cheekio: the accepted method of navigation is element = browser.get_link_method; element.click(), right?
[2013-09-10 21:04:43] lukeis: driver.find_element_by_*('locator').click()   <- I usually only store a local variable if I need to do something else with the element
[2013-09-10 21:05:09] Cheekio: alright
[2013-09-10 21:05:13] Cheekio: so I'm not doing anything crazy
[2013-09-10 21:05:41] Cheekio: I'm also using selenium in a TestCase subclass, as per basically everybody who uses Django's suggestions
[2013-09-10 21:06:03] Cheekio: but I have weird issues like my browser won't always start at the beginning of a test
[2013-09-10 21:06:17] lukeis: but typically i don't even do that…. it's usually in the form or   wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10);   wait.until(ExpectedCondition.element_to_be_clickable('locator')).click()
[2013-09-10 21:14:14] Cheekio: stephend: how'd you come about this knowledge? Is this just trial and error over the course of weeks?
[2013-09-10 21:14:57] stephend: Cheekio: we converted 18 or so suites from selenese/selenium 1 -> WebDriver/Selenium 2
[2013-09-10 21:14:58] stephend: yeah
[2013-09-10 21:15:26] Cheekio: haha
[2013-09-10 21:15:31] Cheekio: so worth its weight in gold
[2013-09-10 21:15:35] stephend: Cheekio: it's not authoritative, but http://marlenacompton.com/?p=2664 is a good pointer
[2013-09-10 21:15:47] stephend: Cheekio: you really should be on WebDriver, if you're not
[2013-09-10 21:16:05] Cheekio: huh what
[2013-09-10 21:16:51] stephend: if you're already on WebDriver, ignore it
[2013-09-10 21:17:00] Cheekio: haha
[2013-09-10 21:17:03] Cheekio: Yeah, I'm on webdriver
[2013-09-10 21:17:09] Cheekio: phew
[2013-09-10 21:17:12] Cheekio: I thought I was about to make another leap
[2013-09-10 21:17:29] Cheekio: You can only take so many leaps before you forget where it was you were trying to get to
[2013-09-10 21:17:30] stephend: heh, no
[2013-09-10 21:17:45] stephend: WebDriver is very much here to stay -- it *is* Selenium :-)
[2013-09-10 21:17:58] stephend: Cheekio: what language are you in?
[2013-09-10 21:18:15] Cheekio: python/english
[2013-09-10 21:18:30] Cheekio: fun fact, I think http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp#explicit-waits reliably crashes ubuntu/chromium
[2013-09-10 21:18:47] Cheekio: nope
[2013-09-10 21:18:52] Cheekio: just two lucky crashes
[2013-09-10 21:19:16] Cheekio: My browser didn't like the formatting on the code snippets for python, probably a local issue
[2013-09-10 21:20:00] stephend: if it's firefox, please report it :-)
[2013-09-10 21:20:19] stephend: my team also works on Socorro, which is the codename for crash-stats :-)

[2013-09-10 21:21:07] Cheekio: I'd use firefox if I could get the dev tools to run smoothly
[2013-09-10 21:21:13] Cheekio: but my computer for some reason is terrible with them
[2013-09-10 21:21:46] Cheekio: That, and I was a chrom fanboy for a while so I'm stuck with google until I find a really compelling reason to switch
[2013-09-10 21:22:06] Cheekio: so yeah, short answer I got no fun crash stats for you
[2013-09-10 21:22:10] Cheekio: although that does sound like a fun job
[2013-09-10 21:26:54] Cheekio: I think I found where I need to put the explicit wait
[2013-09-10 21:27:08] Cheekio: At least this is one place I absolutely need one
[2013-09-10 21:27:54] Cheekio: Using testunit for python, I'm running  a setUp() method which goes to the homepage, and logs into the admin
[2013-09-10 21:28:22] Cheekio: and the whole slew of tests related to this area include clicking on a link at the landing page
[2013-09-10 21:28:30] Cheekio: like 1/4 of the time, the link isn't there
