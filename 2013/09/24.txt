[2013-09-24 02:20:06] zeljkof: as far as I see, we have an old version of phantomjs, looks like ghost driver was not bundled yet
[2013-09-24 02:20:20] detronizator_: which version? you should be using 1.9.2
[2013-09-24 02:20:26] detronizator_: latest and greatest
[2013-09-24 02:20:45] zeljkof: I think we had 1.4, since that is the latest supported in ubuntu :)
[2013-09-24 02:21:03] zeljkof: but one of our guys is creating an ubuntu package with the latest phantomjs
[2013-09-24 02:21:04] zeljkof: https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Backport_packages
[2013-09-24 02:21:07] detronizator_: way too old

[2013-09-24 02:21:19] zeljkof: detronizator_: yes, that is what I thought too
[2013-09-24 02:21:27] detronizator_: I'm sure there is a repo with latest package

[2013-09-24 02:24:33] detronizator_: I'd suggest build it from source
[2013-09-24 02:24:40] detronizator_: it should generate a single binary with all in it
[2013-09-24 02:24:45] hashar: detronizator_: btw, what ever you did on ghostdriver/phantomjs/etc  thank you for all the hardwork!
[2013-09-24 02:25:35] detronizator_: ghostdriver is mostly my work
[2013-09-24 02:26:04] detronizator_: on phantomjs I have contributed the FS api, the CookieJar, work on the WebServer module and other things

[2013-09-24 03:10:25] detronizator_: Ardesco: wait - are you making a joke here? I mean, did anyone ever asked for Localization on WebDriver?

[2013-09-24 03:11:30] Ardesco: i need it
[2013-09-24 03:11:52] Ardesco: our app works in english spansih german and portugese
[2013-09-24 03:12:15] Ardesco: we are currently using HTMLUnit to runs  couple of quick tests that checks that switching locale results in the correct language being displayed
[2013-09-24 03:12:18] detronizator_: and... you print the console output or the API of PhantomJS to your customers?
[2013-09-24 03:12:26] Ardesco: I want to move from HTMLUnit driver to PhantomJS
[2013-09-24 03:12:34] detronizator_: wait a minute
[2013-09-24 03:12:46] detronizator_: you are talking about the locale the BROWSER asks for?
[2013-09-24 03:12:49] Ardesco: yup
[2013-09-24 03:12:52] detronizator_: I'm really confused...
[2013-09-24 03:13:04] Ardesco: so if you load chrome -
[2013-09-24 03:13:12] Ardesco: go to settings -> language
[2013-09-24 03:13:17] Ardesco: and change the language
[2013-09-24 03:13:34] Ardesco: google maps will now display in the language you have selected
[2013-09-24 03:13:38] Ardesco: our app does the same thing
[2013-09-24 03:13:53] Ardesco: based on the browser locale it provide text for that language
[2013-09-24 03:14:15] detronizator_: honest knowledge hole: where that information is shipped?
[2013-09-24 03:14:19] Ardesco: so if you have chrome set to spanish as your favourite language the website will be displayed in spanish
[2013-09-24 03:14:21] detronizator_: as in, which part of the HTTP request
[2013-09-24 03:14:23] detronizator_: carries that?
[2013-09-24 03:14:29] detronizator_: the user agent? I don't recall...
[2013-09-24 03:14:56] Ardesco: HTTP Accept Language header
[2013-09-24 03:14:57] Ardesco: i think
[2013-09-24 03:14:59] *Ardesco checks'
[2013-09-24 03:15:11] Ardesco: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4
[2013-09-24 03:15:15] Ardesco: yup
[2013-09-24 03:15:34] detronizator_: yes
[2013-09-24 03:15:38] detronizator_: Accept Language
[2013-09-24 03:15:39] detronizator_: of course
[2013-09-24 03:15:53] detronizator_: Well, I think you can now in 1.9.2 too
[2013-09-24 03:15:57] detronizator_: as you can set headers
[2013-09-24 03:16:08] detronizator_: how do you set the language on ChromeDrier?
[2013-09-24 03:16:10] detronizator_: ChromeDriver?
[2013-09-24 03:16:37] detronizator_: or FirefoxDriver
[2013-09-24 03:16:39] Ardesco: using chrome options
[2013-09-24 03:16:42] Ardesco: preferances.put("intl.accept_languages", I18n.BROWSER_LOCALE);
[2013-09-24 03:16:51] detronizator_: I see, so via capabilities
[2013-09-24 03:16:54] Ardesco: yup
[2013-09-24 03:17:08] detronizator_: well, you can set headers in ghostdriver/phantomjs too
[2013-09-24 03:17:10] Ardesco: works with Firefox as well
[2013-09-24 03:17:14] detronizator_: gimme a sec to gather code
[2013-09-24 03:17:49] Ardesco: (we force our tests to run in English because they rely on some english text, not everybody is using an english machine which caused some tests to fail at first
[2013-09-24 03:18:30] Ardesco: it's hard getting tests running on everybody's computer when the languages are a lldifferent
[2013-09-24 03:18:32] Ardesco: :)

[2013-09-24 04:47:48] Ardesco: as a general observation
[2013-09-24 04:47:57] simonstewart: The constants that are particular to a specific driver -> that driver class
[2013-09-24 04:47:59] barancev|2: I want to implement a new capability that allows autoscrolling for synthesized events in FF

[2013-09-24 04:48:23] simonstewart: I'd just do the scrolling regardless
[2013-09-24 04:48:30] barancev|2: options are: driver, session, preferences
[2013-09-24 04:48:38] simonstewart: I fear that we're giving people too many gubbins to tweak
[2013-09-24 04:48:48] barancev|2: first I'll implement it as a capability (experimental)
[2013-09-24 04:49:00] barancev|2: ant then we'll make it default
[2013-09-24 04:49:09] simonstewart: I'd just make the firefox driver do the scrolling, and not even make it configurable

[2013-09-24 07:04:00] gdennis: barancev|2: I was debating whether to remove the call to element.scrollIntoView from the implementation of bot.action.scrollIntoView, leaving it all up to the separate JS calculation

[2013-09-24 07:05:05] gdennis: which would probably be a performance hit, but would give us stronger control over doing the minimal amount of scrolling necessary and probably give better cross-browser consistency
[2013-09-24 07:05:28] barancev|2: gdennis: I'd suggest to extract a method isInView()
[2013-09-24 07:05:42] barancev|2: that can be used by implementations to decide on the need of scrolling
[2013-09-24 07:05:44] gdennis: we have getOverflowState for that

[2013-09-24 07:07:50] gdennis: I decided that I didn't like the isInView method, because when it returns false, it doesn't tell you whether it *can* be scrolled into view
[2013-09-24 07:08:05] barancev|2: gdennis: does it check viewport?
[2013-09-24 07:08:11] barancev|2: or only overflow blocks?
[2013-09-24 07:08:18] aweiteka, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-24 07:08:25] gdennis: there's really 3 states: it's in view, it's out of view and can be scrolled into view, it's out of view and cannot be scrolled into view
[2013-09-24 07:08:34] DrJenkins: Hi guys, is BASIC HTTP authentication officially supported in Selenium?
[2013-09-24 07:08:37] gdennis: it considers viewport too
[2013-09-24 07:08:58] gdennis: the logic treats the viewport as the "overflow block" of the HTML element
[2013-09-24 07:09:02] barancev|2: ok, I'll read it, may be it is what I need

[2013-09-24 07:12:42] nirvdrum: Your two options are: embed credentials in the URL or use a proxy server to inject the Basic auth headers.
[2013-09-24 07:13:02] nirvdrum: The former is obviously easier, but browser have different support for it.  The latter should work with everything.

[2013-09-24 10:27:41] petarm: I know I can achieve that on linux with some extra tools besides selenium and python, but is something like that possible on Windows?
[2013-09-24 10:28:40] petarm: I found something that suggests starting Chrome as an external process with AutoIT and have the window hidden, but how would I do that from within python, I have no clue...
[2013-09-24 10:28:44] phasze: phantomjs is probably your best bet

[2013-09-24 10:29:36] lukeis: i think the answer to running selenium on windows headless is… don't. Windows has a display… use it
[2013-09-24 10:29:50] petarm: Hmm... phantomjs you say? ... I will explore the option. Thank you.
[2013-09-24 10:30:14] lukeis: phantomjs is headless anywhere / everywhere ;)
[2013-09-24 10:30:42] Dude-X: will phantomJS remain webkit or will it use the blink engine
[2013-09-24 10:30:52] petarm: lukeis: True that... I should say thought that I am trying to run insurance quotes from different websites at the same time and I want it to happen "invisibly" to the user...

[2013-09-24 10:32:54] lukeis: petarm: might be worth investing some time to see if the insurance companies have some kind of API or other mechanism to get a quote (you might have to / want to contact them)

[2013-09-24 10:48:43] cgoldberg: petarm, using a headless browser to scrape web content is near insanity :)

[2013-09-24 10:53:05] petarm: cgoldberg: I am using Python.
[2013-09-24 10:53:38] cgoldberg: petarm, why do you need a headless selenium, or for that matter a browser at all?
[2013-09-24 10:53:47] cgoldberg: is there something special about the site you are scraping?
[2013-09-24 10:54:36] cgoldberg: use python's http libraries.  or better yet.. use python-requests or mechanize
[2013-09-24 10:54:42] cgoldberg: no need to fire up a full browser
[2013-09-24 10:54:48] petarm: Well, I am not sure they have an API to do that. These are insurance companies... Think 10-20 years behind in technology.
[2013-09-24 10:55:02] cgoldberg: petarm, if it speaks http, you can use that
[2013-09-24 10:55:18] petarm: Hmm... I didn't even know that existed....
[2013-09-24 10:55:41] petarm: I am rather... OK not rather... I am completely new to programming/python.selenium ...
[2013-09-24 10:55:43] cgoldberg: petarm, if a web browser can talk to it.. you can do it programatically with an http library
[2013-09-24 10:56:02] petarm: But how would I know what/how to pass information to it?
[2013-09-24 10:56:14] phasze: fiddler and google ;)
[2013-09-24 10:56:18] cgoldberg: petarm, ok.. so web scraping is an area you definitely wouldn't wanna use selenium for
[2013-09-24 10:56:36] cgoldberg: petarm, in your browsers dev tools
[2013-09-24 10:56:49] cgoldberg: the net panel shows you request content
[2013-09-24 10:57:22] cgoldberg: there are a few gotchas like setting a user agent and handling cookies if needed... but its not bad.. and it's the proper solution
[2013-09-24 10:58:10] cgoldberg: petarm, Firebug is a good start if you use Firefox
[2013-09-24 10:58:22] cgoldberg: Chrome has built in net panel in its dev tools
[2013-09-24 10:58:27] cgoldberg: either will suffice
[2013-09-24 10:59:37] petarm: Got it... Well... Haha... I mean I understand what you are saying. I am not saying I understand how to actually get it to work :).. I did find what you are referring to in Chrome dev tools.
[2013-09-24 11:00:16] petarm: For a simple login to one of the websites it spit out a ton of information... Am I just looking for the GET and POST events, or everything?
[2013-09-24 11:00:20] Oscar, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-24 11:00:28] cgoldberg: petarm, so look at python 'requests' module
[2013-09-24 11:00:37] cgoldberg: it makes crafting http requests very simple
[2013-09-24 11:00:58] cgoldberg: if you get stuck handling cookies.. 'mechanize' library  is helpful
[2013-09-24 11:01:01] petarm: Is it in the standard library?
[2013-09-24 11:01:06] cgoldberg: petarm, no
[2013-09-24 11:01:23] petarm: OK. I'll take a look.  Thanks so much for the information!
[2013-09-24 11:01:24] cgoldberg: petarm, are you restricted to standard library?  if so, use urllib2 instead
[2013-09-24 11:01:42] petarm: No, I was just asking to know where I should look for it.

[2013-09-24 11:03:03] bfife: does that work "well" enough?
[2013-09-24 11:03:40] petarm: Nice... Now, if I get all that figured out... I can make it as a SAAS with Django right? There should be no problem with that? (This last part is a LONG-term goal. I am building this for the company that I work  - in my spare time).
[2013-09-24 11:04:07] phasze: bfife: depends what well enough is :P  I don't use it because it has problems keeping sessions with popups.
[2013-09-24 11:04:45] cgoldberg: petarm, yea no prob
[2013-09-24 11:06:38] petarm: cgoldberg, you have been most helpful. Can I trouble you for one more thing? Any suggestion on what put in Google to get me to a nice "getting started" tutorial for crafting HHTP requests? :)
[2013-09-24 11:08:59] cgoldberg: petarm, tbh, the documentation for requests is fantastic:  http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/
[2013-09-24 11:09:26] cgoldberg: and also do some research on HTTP in general... any networking book or even wikipedia
[2013-09-24 11:09:57] cgoldberg: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol
[2013-09-24 11:10:01] petarm: Got it! Yeah, I landed there and started reading.  Thanks so much... This kind of totally changes the direction I was going it, but it sounds like a much better solution.

[2013-09-24 13:49:22] jimevans: barancev|2: i anticipated possibly allowing different values. the fact that we use scrollIntoView is an implementation detail
[2013-09-24 13:49:45] jimevans: in the language bindings, these express themselves as "top" and "bottom" enum values.
[2013-09-24 13:49:56] jimevans: (or they should)
[2013-09-24 13:50:14] barancev|2: right, but why it is numeric in the specification?
[2013-09-24 13:50:41] jimevans: ease of implementation in the IE driver.

[2013-09-24 13:51:58] barancev|2: numeric is... hmm... C-ish
[2013-09-24 13:52:00] jimevans: because .NET doesn't have string enums, it was easier to implement in .NET too\

[2013-09-24 14:58:42] medecau: I am trying to scrape a page using selenium
[2013-09-24 14:59:06] medecau: it has some info that is loaded when the options of the form change
[2013-09-24 14:59:19] medecau: there are to select input tags
[2013-09-24 14:59:32] medecau: the second depends on the first
[2013-09-24 15:00:17] dhenry, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-09-24 15:00:37] medecau: I am trying to create a list of option elements
[2013-09-24 15:01:25] medecau: I add the options of the second select to the same list of the first and always click() the last item on that list
[2013-09-24 15:02:16] medecau: but I am getting an error that seems to be caused by the fact that it takes sometime to retrieve info from the server
[2013-09-24 15:02:32] medecau: is there anyway I can wait until the JS is done running?
[2013-09-24 15:03:00] phasze: what language?
[2013-09-24 15:03:16] medecau: oh, sorry. I'm using python
[2013-09-24 15:03:33] medecau: over PhantomJS
[2013-09-24 15:04:01] medecau: but that is probably irrelevant

[2013-09-24 15:07:17] phasze: medecau: I'm afraid I'm not familiar with python, but your timeout is on the Click?  I know in .NET it has a default 100 second timeout of which you can extend.
[2013-09-24 15:08:06] jimevans: y'know, if there's a page refresh, the element might not be valid anymore. what's the error?
[2013-09-24 15:08:07] medecau: It's not a timeout. It's StaleElementReferenceException
[2013-09-24 15:08:22] medecau: jimevans: I think that's it
[2013-09-24 15:09:07] jimevans: because when you click on one of the elements in the first select list, the page refreshes, which means any and all element references you've found are now no longer valid.
[2013-09-24 15:09:09] qaguy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-09-24 15:10:10] medecau: jimevans: does that happen even if there is no refresh? meaning that part of the page is overwritten with JS requests?
[2013-09-24 15:10:58] mansi, quitting. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2013-09-24 15:11:07] jimevans: if the part of the DOM to which you previously held references have those elements deleted (and possibly recreated) in the DOM, then yes, that's true.
[2013-09-24 15:11:35] medecau: jimevans: thanks
[2013-09-24 15:11:47] jimevans: np
[2013-09-24 15:12:03] medecau: btw, any idea on how to solve something like this?
[2013-09-24 15:12:18] jimevans: refind the element after the DOM is recreated
[2013-09-24 15:13:04] cgoldberg, quitting. (Quit: Ex-Chat)
[2013-09-24 15:14:45] medecau: is it possible to save an path of an element?
[2013-09-24 15:15:03] medecau: something like element.get_xpath()
[2013-09-24 15:15:17] jimevans: sure, but you have to manage that yourself. there's nothing intrinsic in the library to do it for you.
[2013-09-24 15:15:28] jimevans: mostly because there's no cross-browser way to make it reliable.
[2013-09-24 15:16:14] medecau: all I see is WebElement().location
[2013-09-24 15:16:20] medecau: but that's coordinates
[2013-09-24 15:16:33] jimevans: as i said, you'll have to manage it yourself. you
[2013-09-24 15:17:01] jimevans: you'll need to figure out the identifiers for the elements you want to keep track of cross-DOM manipulation.
