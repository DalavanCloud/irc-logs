[2013-09-27 00:23:29] mindaugasm: Hello, we are interested in paid custom development of selenium-server. We would like to have a "Screenshot on failure" feature to be implemented in selenium server. This feature would take screenshot on any failure selenium would catch, for example on assertText and others. We think this can be easily achieved by adding additional keyword to selenium-server.jar like -ScreenShotOnFailure /path/to/directory/where/to/store/screenshots. Maybe you
[2013-09-27 00:23:29] mindaugasm: know some other better way to achieve this (converting the tests to any other programming language and then adding some other code for catching is not a solution for us - we would like to continue using selenesse)?

[2013-09-27 05:27:31] freynaud: HubStatus does a lot already
[2013-09-27 05:28:26] jarib: i could add it only if the user asks for it
[2013-09-27 05:28:33] freynaud: you may want a separate call , say /grid/api/hub/newSessionCount , that would return only what you want
[2013-09-27 05:28:51] jarib: or that, yeah
[2013-09-27 05:29:14] freynaud: actually
[2013-09-27 05:29:35] freynaud:  grid/api/hub/ already have a mechanism to return only certain params
[2013-09-27 05:29:42] jarib: right
[2013-09-27 05:29:51] freynaud: if you pass a json object to that call, it return only what's in there

[2013-09-27 06:54:30] xapak: Hello.
[2013-09-27 06:56:22] xapak: If there is an upper-cased link that I access with “link=Log Out” on Firefox (the all-uppercase it’s because of a CSS property), but the same on Chrome has to be “link=LOG OUT” or it won’t work... whose fault it is? The bindings I’m using?
[2013-09-27 06:56:49] xapak: I read, and it’s one browser using textContent (or innerText, not sure), and the other using innerHTML. :'(
[2013-09-27 06:57:01] Oscar1: dont use the text?
[2013-09-27 06:57:16] xapak: (okay)
[2013-09-27 06:57:25] Oscar1: what does the code for the link look like, me personally i would add an id to it and use that
[2013-09-27 06:58:36] xapak: I don’t have any say in the matter. And the link it’s the fourth link inside an unidentified div as well.
[2013-09-27 06:58:58] Dave_B_: is it a page we can look at or private?
[2013-09-27 06:59:04] xapak: Private.
[2013-09-27 06:59:14] xapak: I know I can with XPath, I just didn’t want to write all that. :P
[2013-09-27 06:59:34] xapak: But still, my question remains unanswered.
[2013-09-27 07:00:46] jimevans: the actual answer to your original question ("whose fault is it") is that it's likely the fault of either (a) the spec for being unclear, or (b) the browser drivers for not adhering to the spec if it is clear.
[2013-09-27 07:01:12] Oscar1: or it could be how its styled
[2013-09-27 07:01:46] xapak: Oscar1, THAT is the end result, but it’s not *why* they fail.
[2013-09-27 07:02:14] jimevans: Oscar1: according to xapak, it's styled using CSS, and it's the drivers' fault that the styling isn't being interpreted consistently across browsers.
[2013-09-27 07:02:17] Dave_B_: you can quite possibly mitigate the issue if you can work out what is being fetched by whatever your locator is

[2013-09-27 08:17:32] dimacus: jimevans: someone is asking me if it's possible to trigger browser native Print Preview via webdriver… i think they might be crazy, but i figured i'd ask just in case… is that even possible?
[2013-09-27 08:18:32] jimevans: dimacus: they're crazy.
[2013-09-27 08:18:45] dimacus: i'll tell them this with confidence now!
[2013-09-27 08:18:55] jimevans: dimacus: actually, it might be possible to use a native keypress to trigger it, but what would you do with it once you did so?
[2013-09-27 08:19:29] qba73, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-27 08:19:30] dimacus: well take screenshot of the OS completely and kill browser

[2013-09-27 08:20:23] jimevans: right.
[2013-09-27 08:20:49] jimevans: and it wouldn't be cross-browser, unless the same keyboard shortcut was guaranteed to trigger print preview for every browser.
[2013-09-27 08:22:11] umaar: jimevans: I was thinking of a webdriver recipes repo which contains examples of how to do common actions in modern web apps e.g. https://github.com/umaar/webdriver-recipes/issues?state=open
[2013-09-27 08:23:25] dimacus: jimevans:  yeah… i'm gonna tell them to use QTP (as much as it hurts me) bc you can open that and close the print preview on os level
[2013-09-27 08:24:25] jimevans: umaar: have you looked at http://elemental-selenium.com/tips
[2013-09-27 08:25:04] umaar: Ah yes! I've subscribed. It's really cool, but examples are all in Ruby I believe
[2013-09-27 08:25:07] dimacus: maybe some autoit scripts
[2013-09-27 08:25:53] umaar: jimevans: JavaScript examples 'in the wild' are still limited/basic from what I've seen, I think we could benefit from more examples
[2013-09-27 08:25:57] jimevans: dimacus: ugh. what's the use case, anyway? what are they trying to accomplish by triggering print preview? i mean, that's browser functionality
[2013-09-27 08:27:51] dimacus: they tell me they are using HTML to print some stuff like plane tickets instead of PDF, so they need to guarntee that the bar code shows up on page when user prints (not sliding off to 2nd page). Now the problem is that even if you get a screenshot… it will be very dificult for them to compare the look and feel to a tmeplate

[2013-09-27 08:28:11] dimacus: might as well look at it by hand… i'm trying to convince them it's a waste of time trying to automate this flow
[2013-09-27 08:28:39] jimevans: umaar: if you want to do something javascript-specific, that's fine. knock yourself out. in my experience, most examples translate across languages pretty easily.

[2013-09-27 08:29:29] jimevans: dimacus: that's kinda my point. you'll likely need to visually inspect the output anyway to determine pass/fail, so that cries out to be a manual test case.

[2013-09-27 08:31:08] umaar: jimevans: Agreed, but I've found this is truer for bindings in Ruby/Java etc. When it comes to JavaScript, you have to deal with everything being asynchronous, using promises for pretty much everything and such. I still feel the JS bindings are very cool, just not as straight forward as they could be for someone new to WebDriver. It'd be great to have others create some issues in that repo for things they'd like examples of
[2013-09-27 08:31:08] dimacus: yup i'm just trying to make a coherent point so that someone does not sand bag me with "well you can do this"

[2013-09-27 08:33:27] garndt: jimevans: do you know off the top of your head if isSelected will return true if it was a javascript event that selected the radio button?
[2013-09-27 08:34:49] jimevans: garndt: no, sorry. i'd expect it to, since i believe the atom is using the .selected property of the element, but that property may not be updated until the element is blurred, so you probably need to be sure your javascript is doing that.
[2013-09-27 08:36:16] garndt: ah

[2013-09-27 15:16:05] AutomatedTester: create a private cloud
[2013-09-27 15:16:06] mreedell-work, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-09-27 15:16:44] tkeith: AutomatedTester: That's not really an option for me sadly... I'm running on digitalocean which doesn't really offer that option. The SSH way I'm doing now does work and is secure, but it's inflexible and annoying. Hopefully I can figure out a reverse proxy or something...

[2013-09-27 15:17:06] AutomatedTester: digital ocean offer it on the NYC datacenter
[2013-09-27 15:17:06] p_l: tkeith: setup OpenVPN?
[2013-09-27 15:17:35] tkeith: AutomatedTester: No, the private network is stil accessble to any other instances in that datacenter
[2013-09-27 15:18:10] tkeith: p_l, wouldn't that still be more work than SSH? I'm trying to get away from the tunnel/VPN type solutions and make it a more basic secure client/server model

[2013-09-27 15:18:48] p_l: tkeith: IMO not really... tunneling through SSH is more annoying because you need to remember proxies etc. (unless you use that tun mode, which requires apropriate permissions)
[2013-09-27 15:19:28] tkeith: p_l: What do you mean? I just do ssh -L 4444:localhost:4444 sel-server
[2013-09-27 15:19:36] tkeith: p_l: And then treat it as a local instance
[2013-09-27 15:19:44] p_l: ah, this way
[2013-09-27 15:19:57] p_l: well, I find it easier to setup openvpn as service and have it "always on"
[2013-09-27 15:20:10] p_l: so it looks like the test infrastructure is in local lan
[2013-09-27 15:20:19] tkeith: Selenium in the cloud is actually great because I can spin up a bunch of instances, run all my tests quickly, and shut them down and only pay for an hour
[2013-09-27 15:20:49] tkeith: p_l: Yeah, I haven't done much with VPNs before
[2013-09-27 15:21:21] jleyba, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-09-27 15:21:24] tkeith: p_l: I really don't like the concept though... it *should* be possible to get it set up as a secure server with authentication. VPN (or SSH) just seem like overkill
