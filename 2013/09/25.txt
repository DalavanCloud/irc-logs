[2013-09-25 05:04:13] DrJenkins: in my current solution, i have a method called moveMouseOnElement and I was thinking about adding a check to detect the active drive, and if it is phantomjs I will do something else as action.moveToElement is failing in headless browsers. What I am looking for is some kind of javascript injection in the page to "fake" the event.

[2013-09-25 06:51:54] jimevans: all that change does is create a new crazy-fun target type of js_fragment_csharp, which allows a driver to output the results of javascript atom compilation to a C# file (mirroring what we do for C++ and Java)
[2013-09-25 06:52:10] jimevans: and no drivers actually use that target type.

[2013-09-25 09:54:04] jleyba: jimevans: it just wraps bot.locators.findElement, which returns null if the element cannot be found
[2013-09-25 09:54:34] jimevans: i didn't realize findElement worked that way.
[2013-09-25 09:54:42] jleyba: interpreting null as <no such element> has always been a higher level action (although I'd be open to pushing this into webdriver.atoms.inject)
[2013-09-25 09:55:49] lukeis: yeah, if you use some (most?) of the php bindings, you get a null for findElement instead of an exception
