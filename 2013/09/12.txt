[2013-09-12 13:14:20] jleyba: you have an executeAsyncScript call that does not terminate before a new page is loaded

[2013-09-12 13:19:38] lrvick: headless box

[2013-09-12 13:20:37] lrvick: but yeah ideally
[2013-09-12 13:20:57] lrvick: we will have a seperate selenium server on an ubuntu vm with all the browsers installed
[2013-09-12 13:21:42] lrvick: but i just want to see phantomjs work, so I can at least use this as a part of my headless dev process.

[2013-09-12 13:34:21] jleyba: on the phantomjs side, it's not detecting this page load and waiting for it to complete
[2013-09-12 13:34:56] jleyba: on the protractor side, line 274 should probably gracefully handle when the executeAsyncScript call fails b/c the page loads

[2013-09-12 15:36:09] smccarthy: Do people map automated tests to manual tests?
[2013-09-12 15:36:24] stephend: smccarthy: we do, yeah
[2013-09-12 15:36:40] stephend: one of our community contributors even wrote a plugin to help associate and track that
[2013-09-12 15:37:28] smccarthy: stephend: oh ok... I was asked to do so, and wondered if other people people do it as well. Isn't it like twice the work? Writing a manual test AND an autoamted test?
[2013-09-12 15:37:47] stephend: it's tied to a tool we also wrote and use, in-house -- MozTrap
[2013-09-12 15:38:04] stephend: https://github.com/klrmn/pytest-moztrap is the plugin for pytest-mozwebqa, which is another plugin, itself :-)
[2013-09-12 15:38:36] stephend: smccarthy: in the heavier, more-important projects, we do manual first, typically, then write automation to cover it, vet the results, and then get rid of the manual test
[2013-09-12 15:39:07] stephend: there are times when a manual test is worth it for exploratory testing, more than the simple case you're really supposed to be testing
[2013-09-12 15:39:16] stephend: but straight-up duplication is bad, IMHO, of course :-)
[2013-09-12 15:39:53] stephend: sfbrian: what do you guys do?
[2013-09-12 15:40:05] smccarthy: I think they have the same idea here. Write the manual test, automate it, and get rid of the manual test once the automated one works great
[2013-09-12 15:40:13] stephend: yeah
[2013-09-12 15:40:18] stephend: it's worth it, if you do it right
[2013-09-12 15:41:03] stephend: and even though our Django devs write a ton of tests (mostly unit), and we're tempted at making our test suites leaner, I'm amazed at the seemingly random bugs we've found with old, old tests
[2013-09-12 15:41:26] sfbrian: stephend: we tried to do that using testlink. Too difficult
[2013-09-12 15:41:38] *stephend nods'
[2013-09-12 15:41:49] stephend: we never got ourselves using that mapping plugin either
[2013-09-12 15:42:09] sfbrian: stephend: then we got a license for test rail and then never full implemented it either
[2013-09-12 15:42:11] smccarthy: I'm at the point now, where I am trying to reduce the number of frontend tests, and try for more middletier tests....
[2013-09-12 15:43:20] sfbrian: it was never a high enough priority for us
[2013-09-12 15:43:40] stephend: our frontend tests have served us well, but they take a ton of maintenance time
[2013-09-12 15:43:52] stephend: even with good explicit waits and a robust page-object model
[2013-09-12 15:44:02] stephend: (our devs don't really update them, which sucks -- it's all on us)
