[03:09:24] intchanter: I need another bit of help with the build process.  ./go is returning with "jar: command not found" and "could not zip ... webdriver.xpi".  It looks like the jar utility only exists as part of Sun's official java dist, but that zip should do the trick.  How do I tell the build process to use zip to make the .xpi file?
[03:41:18] intchanter: In case it's relevant, I'm on Fedora for this.

[16:53:57] zezikaro: They're simple findElement(By.id("foo")).click()

[18:32:40] garndt: zezikaro: what is the error that you get?
[18:33:06] zezikaro: garndt it was mentioning that it couldn't find the element with the given selector
[18:33:16] zezikaro: I added a delay to wait for the page to load and that worked though
[18:33:45] garndt: The element is visible? Are you sure that your locator is correct?
[18:34:21] zezikaro: Yip, I was using the basic By class
[18:34:35] zezikaro: And it would randomly fail 40-50% of the time
[18:35:00] garndt: by class?  What you said earlier us By.id()
[18:35:10] garndt: oh
[18:35:12] garndt: nevermind
[18:35:16] garndt: <-brain fart
[18:35:36] garndt: any way you could use pastebin or something to show me a snippet of your code and a snippet of the html?  I could try to take a look at it
[18:35:55] garndt: is it the same element that it's failing 40-50% of the time with?
[18:36:31] zezikaro: garndt yeah
[18:36:38] garndt: hrm
[18:36:39] garndt: odd
[18:37:00] zezikaro: i assumed it was just a race condition
[18:37:06] zezikaro: So I googled how to delay web driver
[18:37:12] zezikaro: And that worked
[18:37:16] zezikaro: and it passes all the time now
[18:37:37] garndt: ah, I must have misread when you said it works all the time now. 
[18:37:51] garndt: so you're using webdriverwait now?
[18:37:54] zezikaro: Even though the element is always there on page load, it's not injected by javascript or anything
[18:38:13] zezikaro: Yip, although it seems wrong for me to do that
[18:38:18] garndt: why?
[18:38:19] zezikaro: Since it's a pretty basic html assert that i was doing
[18:38:22] zezikaro: And it's there on pageload
[18:38:25] zezikaro: It's not dynamic
[18:38:31] zezikaro: It should pass 100% of the time :P
[18:38:48] garndt: what is the exception that is being thrown?  ElementNotVisible? StaleReferenceException?
[18:38:55] garndt: ElementNotFound?
[18:39:07] zezikaro: It couldn't find it with the given selector
[18:39:09] zezikaro: "h2"
[18:39:19] zezikaro: (I don't have the exact log sorry :(
[18:39:20] garndt: and it should not pass 100% if the time if your script decides to start executing before the browser is done rendering the page.
[18:39:45] garndt: even though visually the element is there and it seems that it could start referencing that element, the browser just might not be completely done yet
[18:39:53] garndt: and the script jumped the gun and started executing the next piece of code
[18:40:06] garndt: and yes, that could happen even for static pages
[18:40:28] zezikaro: The full logic was; webdriver.findElement(By.id("foo")).click(); assert("hello world", webdriver.findElement(By.tag("h2)).getText());
[18:40:33] zezikaro: Something along those lines
[18:40:39] zezikaro: And the second part would fail randomly
[18:40:53] garndt: ah
[18:41:06] garndt: is that click() clicking a link?
[18:41:09] zezikaro: yeah
[18:41:13] garndt: and that loads a new page with an h2 tag?
[18:41:21] zezikaro: yip :)
[18:41:30] garndt: well then it definitely seems like the script is jumping to the next line of execution before the browser is completely done with the page
[18:41:35] garndt: happens (a lot)
[18:41:40] zezikaro: :(
[18:41:52] zezikaro: about 50% of the time! :D
[18:42:00] garndt: it's very difficult for webdriver to determine when the browser is completely done rendering a page and the script can continue
[18:42:11] zezikaro: How does it hook into it?
[18:42:12] garndt: it does the best that it can, but is not fool proof
[18:42:29] garndt: how does webdriver hook into the browser?
[18:42:32] zezikaro: yeah
[18:42:43] zezikaro: I mean, the test would pass if it fired on dom load even
[18:42:43] garndt: uses the native automation libraries for the browser
[18:42:55] zezikaro: ah
[18:43:07] zezikaro: I thought it was at the javascript level
[18:43:47] garndt: I have introduced some logic into my automation for trying to make some intelligent guesses as to when pages are loaded and ready to be interacted with and also some logic for locating elements that might not exist yet (because the page isn't fully loaded)
[18:43:56] garndt: well, it used to be that way with selenium 1
[18:44:12] garndt: if you are using selenium 2, which I hope you are, then it's native events for the most part
[18:44:32] zezikaro: Sorry i'm new to selenium/webdriver
[18:44:37] zezikaro: I'm using webdriver 
[18:44:46] garndt: yea, then that is not using javascript for controlling the browser
[18:44:47] zezikaro: 2.28.0
[18:44:59] zezikaro: hm
[18:45:12] zezikaro: That implies that two tests would run differently in firefox/chrome right?
[18:45:22] garndt: it could
[18:45:32] zezikaro: So I'm running these tests in firefox atm which fail randomly, but might not fail randomly in chrome
[18:45:36] zezikaro: haha okay great 
[18:46:07] garndt: tests failing was even more likely when using javascript to drive the browser because of different javascript engine implementations
[18:46:44] zezikaro: yeah, i thought it would be a bit awkward with javascript assertions; Which was why i was testing selenium with basic static html asserts
[18:46:58] zezikaro: And even that failed =[
[18:47:11] zezikaro: Are there any other alternatives to selenium?
[18:47:30] garndt: selenium and webdriver will only solve some of your pain points with browser automation.  Your scripts will need to solve the rest of the problems
[18:47:33] zezikaro: I've tried phantomjs/zombiejs/testacular, but for javascript testing
[18:47:43] zezikaro: hm =[
[18:47:52] zezikaro: nodejs testing*
[18:47:57] garndt: the problem you are facing will be a problem with any browser driven framework you decide to use
[18:48:10] zezikaro: zombiejs dealt with it nicely
[18:48:17] zezikaro: But it was headless which was a pain
[18:48:34] zezikaro: and testacular is angularjs only which is saddening too
[18:48:55] zezikaro: I'll have to wait a few years then :D

[19:01:07] zezikaro: garndt Random question; Do you happen to use checkstyle?
[19:02:07] garndt: As in this: http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/?
[19:04:02] garndt: I do not use anything called "checkstyle".  Was just curious if that's the package you were speaking of
[19:04:06] garndt: I'm not a Java developer.
[19:04:51] zezikaro: garndt Yip that's the one :)
[19:05:04] zezikaro: garndt are you a Groovy/ruby follower?
[19:05:10] garndt: Python
[19:05:15] zezikaro: ah cool
[19:05:24] garndt: although I have been known to dabble with ruby
[19:05:33] zezikaro: Are there checkstyle type programs for python?
[19:06:01] garndt: there are a few type of packages, but mostly I think people just try to adhere to pep-8
[19:06:10] garndt: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
[19:06:50] garndt: pythontidy should help with adhering to pep-8
[19:07:18] zezikaro: hm
[19:07:23] zezikaro: do you follow the 80 char rule?
[19:07:25] garndt: I much prefer changing my workflow and style to match a particular language's style than have something try to do it for me
[19:07:26] garndt: no
[19:07:28] zezikaro: "Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters."
[19:07:35] garndt: that's a large debated thing across all languages 
[19:07:38] garndt: largely 
[19:07:38] zezikaro: lol
[19:08:05] garndt: that's also why I like trying to follow a guide rather than some package force me to adhere to it or bug the hell out of me when I don't.
[19:08:09] detronizator_hom has joined #selenium
[19:08:18] garndt: Sometimes I might not completely agree with that language's style guideline
[19:09:24] garndt: at least from what I've seen, people seem to like those type of packages to take someones' very poorly written code to be slightly less poorly written.  It won't fix the programmer though.  Only hides the true problem.
[19:11:12] zezikaro: yeah i'm not a fan of it either
[19:11:13] zezikaro: hm
[19:12:07] detronizator_hom has joined #selenium
[19:15:27] garndt: so for my own code I follow my own heavily-influenced-by-pep8 style, and if I were going to contribute to some open source project, I would adhere to their guidelines rather than the language styles. The project maintainers are the ones that have to deal most with the code, so pleasing them is much more important than trying to adhere to some golden style
[19:15:27] garndt: (within reason).
[19:17:34] garndt: and depending on the project, that might even mean I have to ignore my personal style of not caring as much about 80 character lines and following the rules by the project maintainers. Oh well though.
[19:17:57] garndt: it's not a playground that I built, it's only one I wish to play in.  Gotta follow the rules of the playground.
