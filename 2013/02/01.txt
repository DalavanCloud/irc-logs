[16:46:08] lukeis: i can't explain it… but needle piecing flesh is absolutely the worst image possible to me… i hate it when movies / tv show it
[16:46:19] dude-x: btw lukeis, never do a medical study where they test your blood sugar level; they'll prick all your finger tips; I HATE THAT
[16:46:49] dude-x: i wanted to strangle the nurse by finger 4
[16:49:29] dude-x: i don't mind needles when they take my blood, but pricking the hands or fingers hurts a lot.

[17:02:22] dude-x: i had one nurse did a terrible job putting an IV. gave me a terrible sore arm and a huge bruise
[17:03:00] dude-x: I wanted her fire
[17:03:03] regex___: jimevans: What up playa.
[17:03:09] dude-x: fired; or rather lit on fire

[17:37:59] adamgoucher: to a certain extent, yes
[17:38:34] barancev: afaik, they prepare a version with webdriver engine
[17:39:19] dude-x: they acutally use selenium webdriver?
[17:39:48] barancev: not yet
[17:40:04] jimevans: regex__: the .Build() method returns an IAction, not an Action. System.Action is a .NET framework type. IAction is what you want.
[17:40:27] jimevans: and yes, you call the .Perform() method on the IAction object.
[17:40:45] jimevans: the .NET API mirrors the Java API in this respoect.
[17:41:04] lukeis: is there a shortcut to just .Perfom() on the Actions?
[17:41:35] *lukeis could look himself...
[17:41:54] regex___: jimevans: Figured it out.  Yeah, that was it.  
[17:42:10] jimevans: lukeis: yes, there is a shortcut. just like in java.

[18:10:26] sayd: i have a WebDriverWait(wd,30).until(element_to_be_clickable((By.LINK_TEXT, "Testing Tweet"))).click() which opens a new page
[18:10:46] sayd: and then WebDriverWait(wd,30).until(element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, "edit-delete"))).click() which should trigger the popup but the popup is rarely triggered

[18:16:55] sayd: yeah. looking at the conditions for a page loaded :)
[18:17:16] sayd: which I dont see
[18:18:32] dude-x: a driver.get, or an element.click() will block until the page "loads"
[18:18:44] dude-x: that's why it doesn't exist
[18:19:24] dude-x: however a page can finish "loading" and then kick off other javascript that will take time to execute

[18:40:49] sayd: https://gist.github.com/c2228608a02a3dde4852
[18:41:09] sayd: the first one exectutes the click and opens a new page
[18:41:16] sayd: the second one never seems to click
[18:41:33] dude-x: i'm suspecting there's some javascript occuring that gets in the way
[18:41:47] sayd: yeah prob (drupal)
[18:42:03] dude-x: then you have to use firebug with fireDiff to see what events are occuring
[18:42:07] sayd: how would i work around that?
[18:42:52] dude-x: say that after the button is displayed, it's still creating new DOM elements

[19:01:17] jimevans: santiycr: yt?
[19:03:22] sayd: dude-x: not sure what you mean
[19:04:48] dude-x: you click on a widget. it opens up a page that has all these widgets running
[19:05:10] dude-x: the thing you're concerned about is the last thing to get updated, that is close to the widget you want to interact with
[19:05:36] dude-x: that can be a command to display a button that is close to the widget
[19:05:42] dude-x: you wait for that button to be visible
[19:05:50] dude-x: before you click on the button you want to click on
[19:07:14] sayd: seems weird
[19:08:12] dude-x: it's the way Javascript just works
[19:09:28] sayd: is it that or is it that selenium can't do things when js is executing

[20:11:04] dude-x: anyone british around?
[20:11:05] jimevans: regex__: there are two ways to navigate. use driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(), or to set the driver.Url property. it differs from other languages because we try to make the bindings for a particular language feel "natural" to people who develop in those languages.

[21:44:30] KaibutsuX: hmm
[21:44:41] KaibutsuX: have you tried the same thing locally without using the virtualdisplay?
[21:45:06] KaibutsuX: what you're doing doesn't look wrong
[21:45:32] kentor: well its a remote box
[21:45:38] kentor: there is no display
[21:45:43] kentor: its a node on  AWS
[21:45:51] KaibutsuX: i mean try it on your box that you're on now
[21:46:08] kentor: im on a windows machine here
[21:46:17] KaibutsuX: doesnt matter
[21:46:19] kentor: i need to run this programmatically
[21:46:27] KaibutsuX: install python?
[21:46:30] KaibutsuX: or not an option?
[21:46:43] kentor: its a completely different machine, with none of that installed at all
[21:47:16] kentor: before you run that script
[21:47:17] KaibutsuX: im just saying, all you would need to install is python and then map the remote filesystem as a drive on your windows
[21:47:27] kentor: do you need to do anything before that
[21:47:31] KaibutsuX: you shouldn't
[21:47:36] kentor: do you need to start browsermob separetely
[21:47:37] KaibutsuX: does the remote have java installed?
[21:47:40] kentor: open up a port
[21:47:43] kentor: yes
[21:47:47] KaibutsuX: no, thats what server.start() does
[21:47:56] kentor: I've tried java but ran into some issues as well
[21:48:09] kentor: I couldn't find a good example for java
[21:48:13] KaibutsuX: what do you mean
[21:48:21] KaibutsuX: the browsermobproxy relies on java to start
[21:48:30] KaibutsuX: the server.start() is just basically a wrapper for it
[21:51:05] KaibutsuX: i suppose it could be a port issue.
[21:51:26] KaibutsuX: you can print server.port and server.url to see what it's using
[21:51:41] KaibutsuX: and make sure those are accessible
[21:52:00] kentor: ok

[23:18:14] jimevans: santiycr: if you're still looking for the atoms piece, './go //cpp:atoms' should create the atoms.h used by the IE driver.
[23:19:28] KaibutsuX: kentor: you should be using the python webdriver bindings, correct?
[23:22:33] kentor: im not sure what I'm using to be honest
[23:22:38] kentor: i have installed so many different packages
[23:22:43] kentor: and so many different things
[23:22:55] kentor: i am pretty confused :)
[23:28:28] KaibutsuX: you shouldn't need any java packages except for whats included in browsermobproxy
[23:28:42] kentor: ok let me try that
[23:34:06] kentor: KaibutsuX, can you please point me to the correct CentOS link for webdriver?
[23:38:09] KaibutsuX: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium
[23:38:13] KaibutsuX: you just need that
[23:38:58] KaibutsuX: anyone here know if webdriver has any notification for unresponsive script? my d.execute_script is not throwing any exceptions on while(true) {alert()}
[23:40:30] lukeis: that won't be un-responsive… that's javascript waiting for the alert to return ;)
[23:41:03] KaibutsuX: well I've been getting them from deep in firefox's engine and I want a way to either ignore when it shows the prompt
[23:42:02] lukeis: i don't know if firefox treats that like a confirmation window or another type of window… if it's another type you're likely SOL
[23:42:28] lukeis: and if you are getting those, it's a legitimate UI bug
[23:42:28] KaibutsuX: figuresd
[23:42:46] lukeis: as in a bug in your application (if you're testing it…)
[23:42:54] kentor: KaibutsuX, that is the standalone one no?
[23:43:03] kentor: that is what I am using
[23:43:24] KaibutsuX: there may be some confusion here, I always took the standalone to mean the java RC server
[23:43:52] KaibutsuX: you're not running a "server" for webdriver, you're just invoking the driver using the python bindings, it doesn't use a server
[23:44:12] KaibutsuX: and lukeis: even if the unresponsive script is coming from in fx-googlecode.js?
[23:44:17] KaibutsuX: or something like that
[23:44:32] cfgregory has left #selenium
[23:44:36] kentor: well hmm but http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium  is what I have installed
[23:45:27] lukeis: KaibutsuX: I'm not sure what that script is… is it included in the page source? or is that in a (or webdriver's) firefox extension?
[23:46:47] KaibutsuX: lukeis: no not my page source, I assume in FF
[23:46:52] KaibutsuX: kentor: thats good thats what you need
[23:47:20] kentor: ok but the file is "selenium-server-standalone-2.29.0.jar"
[23:47:44] KaibutsuX: oh, no, you want below that
[23:47:50] KaibutsuX: selenium-2.29.0.tar.gz (md5)
[23:48:15] lukeis: why would they need that one?
[23:48:39] lukeis: the deprecation warning is valid (just reading up what i've missed)
[23:48:55] lukeis: new way of using a proxy with selenium firefox and python
[23:48:56] lukeis: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp#using-a-proxy
[23:48:59] KaibutsuX: oh ok
[23:49:03] KaibutsuX: Im still on 2.28
[23:49:48] KaibutsuX: wait a minute, so just having the jar file present in my directory allows me to call methods from python
[23:49:48] KaibutsuX: ?
[23:50:12] lukeis: huh?
[23:50:27] lukeis: the jar file does nothing unless you run it
[23:50:41] kentor: hmm honestly, i may have installed the python one but im not sure, i have so many different dirs
[23:50:44] lukeis: and by run it's … java -jar selenium-server-standalone....
[23:50:56] lukeis: then with the python install from pypi
[23:51:04] lukeis: you do webdriver.Remote(....)
[23:51:23] lukeis: webdriver.Firefox() or webdriver.Chrome()  and you don't need the standalone server
[23:51:35] KaibutsuX: oh ok, yes I don't use the standalone server
[23:51:48] lukeis: and to install python it's recommended to use pip… 'pip install -U selenium'
[23:52:02] lukeis: don't need to download anything
[23:52:13] lukeis: (pip does it)
[23:52:16] kentor: yea i definitely did that
[23:52:30] stephend has joined #selenium
[23:52:36] KaibutsuX: ok, my setup is a bit different, I actually download because we share the selenium source on a network drive
[23:52:52] lukeis: that's… umm… weird :)
[23:53:15] KaibutsuX: it's easier than making sure everyone here is on the same version
[23:54:02] lukeis: i'm sure you could tell pip to install to a different location...
[23:54:13] lukeis: but the download works ;)
