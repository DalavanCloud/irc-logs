[16:51:34] jimevans: i'm running the remote server (on windows), and requesting a new firefox driver, but i'm getting a session with native events turned off.
[16:52:08] lukeis: jimevans: do you know how we can do what nirvdrum suggested? (get a project license for MSDN) you know, for free because we are open source :)
[16:52:18] lukeis: request it at least
[16:53:05] jimevans: lukeis: no idea. any information about that would be found the same way anyone else would find it - search-engine-fu.
[16:53:06] nirvdrum: jimevans: I was seeing the same with IE.  Are native events off by default now?

[16:53:35] nirvdrum: jimevans: That error I shared with you the other day was the first time I noticed I wasn't used native events.

[16:53:57] jimevans: nirvdrum: well now that starts to make more sense.

[16:54:28] regex: jimevans: I am trying to click all edit buttons.  Using this syntax: By.CssSelector("button.btn.btn-mini.btn-success")) 
[16:54:40] nirvdrum: jimevans: But I didn't question it much because I thought you had introduced a new capability recently around requesting native events.
[16:54:45] regex: I get this exception: Element is not clickable at point (1011.5, 11). Other element would receive the click: <div class="container">...</div>
[16:55:08] jimevans: nirvdrum: introduced a new capability, yes, but it defaults to native events being on (or it should)
[16:55:31] jimevans: regex: sounds like your target element is obscured by another element.
[16:55:49] regex: jimevans: Any tricks to get around that? 
[16:55:52] jimevans: regex: and you didn't mention it, but i'd be willing to bet you're using google chrome.

[16:56:43] jimevans: or use firefox.
[16:56:57] nirvdrum: jimevans: Well, this was a problem at least with 2.29.0 then as well.  Sorry, I should have been more vocal about it before the 2.30.0 release.
[16:57:00] jimevans: regex: you *did* run through your demo before using it?
[16:57:28] regex: jimevans: I am a web developer and was given 25 minutes to setup.  I didn't want to revert all my changes back to a stable build. 
[16:57:31] jimevans: nirvdrum: somebody really should investigate that. :)
[16:57:47] dude-x: regex: i've had a demo of webdriver fail on me too

[16:58:20] regex: dude-x: That's rough..
[16:58:21] dude-x: but it worked in my practice run several times
[16:59:15] jimevans: regex: demo-giving 101. never give a demo to people who matter without running through it. or without making it clear to those viewing the demo that they're looking at experimental code and it's subject to potential failure.
[16:59:19] nirvdrum: jimevans: I can give it a shot.  I have no clue where I'd be looking, though.  I'm playing a lot of catch up with my WD knowledge.

[17:05:09] lukeis: jimevans: my search-fu has landed me on this http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-options/for-industries.aspx#tab=4  I think we can qualify (err, Software Freedom Conservancy can qualify) to get such a license (and give it to us).. it's mainly for Windows OS licenses but appears to qualify for other software as well.

[17:10:35] dawagner: jimevans: hi
[17:11:37] jimevans: dawagner: i'm running into a strange issue, and was hoping i could get some help looking into it. i'm requesting firefox sessions from a remote server, and getting back sessions with native events turned off, even for windows.
[17:11:53] jimevans: i don't even know where to start looking.
[17:12:00] stephend has joined #selenium
[17:12:04] dawagner: That definitely sounds weird...
[17:12:13] dawagner: Got a repro?
[17:12:22] regex: jimevans: All front end jquery stuff.  Runs more poorly in Firefox and IE.  Runs smooth in Chrome.
[17:12:28] jimevans: nirvdrum is reporting the same thing with IE, which is even weirder.
[17:12:56] jimevans: regex: you asked for a workaround. :)
[17:13:01] *jimevans hates jquery
[17:13:32] regex: jimevans: Anyway to click the center of that button?
[17:14:11] jimevans: regex: when you use the .Click() method of IWebElement, you'll be clicking in the center of the element in question.
[17:14:18] barancev: jimevans: watch firefox error console, it should tell which native event modules it's trying to load

[17:19:52] qaguy: quick question gentlemen. I just installed 2.30 (ruby gem for webdriver). Tried to run my tests in safari. It launches but all i see is this "SafariDriver requesting connection at ws://127.0.0.1:64728/wd"
[17:20:03] qaguy: Do I need to do something to open that port?

[17:23:56] qaguy: I have safari 6.0.2
[17:24:18] qaguy: on MAC 10.8.2
[17:25:00] nirvdrum: qaguy: Did you install the Safari extension?  I don't know if that's handled automatically now.
[17:25:20] nirvdrum: That might also just be the start-up page.  Did you try to navigate to a URL afterwards?
[17:25:49] jimevans: nirvdrum: as of 2.30, safari extension installation is handled automatically.
[17:26:17] nirvdrum: jimevans: Okay. I saw it was packaged but wasn't sure if that still meant a manual install, like the cybervillains cert.
[17:26:26] qaguy: nirvdrum: no didn't install but according to the wiki with 2.30 SafariDriver is bundled with the Selenium server so should not need to
[17:26:53] nirvdrum: qaguy: See my above comment.  "bundled" hasn't always meant "zero install" *shrug*

[17:31:13] qaguy: I can log as an "issue"
[17:31:17] jimevans: regex: no, i wouldn't think so. .Perform() returns void, so you can't assign it to the clickOffSet variable.

[22:10:29] zsawyer: Hi. I am currently working on a java-web app maven project. I am using the org.openqa.selenium.htmlunit.HtmlUnitDriver . When building the project a cargo container starts starts failsave/surefire and runs the selenium tests. This works fairly well. However since we have multiple people working on the project the target's URL (if only the base url) differs for each user. Has anyone got any idea how I can pass the current user's target base ur
[22:11:41] lukeis: totic: yep, that worked for me

[22:14:28] lukeis: zsawyer: make it a variable?   driver.get(baseURL + "/something") ?
[22:14:33] lukeis: totic: no
[22:14:43] lukeis: really that is only for htmlunit
[22:15:06] lukeis: selenium is javascript based, you can't disable it for most of our drivers :)
[22:18:00] _kW has joined #selenium
[22:19:15] zsawyer: lukeis: yes that is the idea. the problem is that the "contextPath" is specified in the pom.xml and may with each user profile in there. I cannot pass that contextPath through environment parameters as cargo doesn't seem to support that properly. Maybe this is more a maven/cargo issue than a selenium one after all... 
[22:19:50] lukeis: yep, sure is :)
[22:20:04] lukeis: i've had my fair share of fun passing maven variables to the jvm
[22:20:17] zsawyer: any hints?
[22:21:11] lukeis: there's ways to use maven properties and pass those in to everywhere you need
[22:21:26] lukeis: i haven't done it in 1+ years, so it's not fresh in my head
[22:23:25] zsawyer: yeah the maven properties work for the normal project (development or production build) but as soon as I want to start an integration test cargo when building the properties are not present at all. :(
[22:23:27] dude-x: how properties gets passed into Java is a mystery to me too …. 
[22:23:31] totic: lukeis: found the problem, the DesiredCapabilities.SAFARI breaks it
[22:24:11] lukeis: totic: yeah, because that sets the version at 5 i believe
[22:24:17] davehunt has joined #selenium
[22:24:35] lukeis: that should probably be removed from the DesiredCapabilities object in the bindings

[23:14:47] barancev: the only separate Java 7 security update was http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013update-1905892.html
[23:15:10] barancev: oops, sorry, this one: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2013-0422-1896849.html
[23:16:27] barancev: and this one was for desktops only

[23:35:31] linguini: Is it possible to tell selenium "just use as much of this site as possible", and to do something when a javascript error occurs?

[23:38:43] dude-x: linguini: be more specific
[23:39:45] linguini: dude-x: hmm.  I want web-spider-like behavior to flush out Internal Server Errors and javascript errors.
[23:40:22] dude-x: for the first, use exception handlng to do sometihng sensible
[23:40:26] dude-x: like log it to a file
[23:40:30] dude-x: instead of giving up
[23:40:42] dude-x: javascript errors not so sure what to do in that case
[23:40:47] dude-x: sometimes they can lock up webdriver
[23:41:00] linguini: dude-x: E.g. selenium http://my.test.site/ # selenium fires up some version of a browser and "explores" the site automatically [ideally with some stored form data].
[23:41:19] linguini: dude-x: Right; I server errors are logged.
[23:41:23] dude-x: selenium IDE?
[23:41:29] kentor: does anybody have an example of how to detect whether a specific js var is ready to be used?
[23:41:30] dude-x: or selenium webdriver?
[23:41:48] linguini: dude-x: I'm not sure; I'm completely new to selenium.  I'm trying to find out what tool will help me.
[23:41:56] dude-x: kentor use webdriver wait and wait for execute script to equal a value
[23:43:12] dude-x: kentor: what language are you using?
[23:43:16] linguini: I suspect what I want is a hard problem to solve, because of the nature of javascript.  But I thought perhaps selenium might have this "auto-explore" feature.
[23:43:36] kentor: java
[23:43:38] dude-x: linguini: it's not a spider
[23:43:49] dude-x: you'd have to write that code yourself
[23:44:36] linguini: dude-x: Hmm.  Thanks.  I'll do some googling for spiders.
[23:45:08] dude-x: kentor: you'd have to use a WebDriverWait class and write an ExpectedCondtion where executeJavascript returns a boolean
[23:45:53] dude-x: something like "return value === expected_value;" 
[23:46:09] dude-x: you might add a try/except there
[23:47:37] kentor: ok ill try to find an example online
[23:47:40] kentor: thanks dude-x
[23:50:22] zsawyer: this helped me - http://blog.martinelli.ch/2010/08/integrating-seleniumhq-and-maven2.html - it appear that I already had this working but a colleague screwed with the properties and renamed some insignificantly (appsrvUrl -> appsrv.url). Changed it for his profile and in the code but the rest of us were left in the dark -.- .

[23:54:00] intchanter-work: Trying to build from the github trunk, and it dies at "org.apache.tools.ant.BuildException: Test org.openqa.selenium.javascript.ClosureTestSuite failed".  What does that indicate I need to change in my environment to get this working?
[23:54:26] intchanter-work: I'm past when my ride usually leaves, so I'll check for an answer from home (intchanter).
