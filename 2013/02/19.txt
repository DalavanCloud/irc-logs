[03:50:03] rmancy: Hi Guys. I'm trying to understand what the docs mean when they say that webdriver drives browsers  "using each browserâ€™s native support for automation". Doesn't this just mean that they call the browsers internal JS engine ?
[03:50:42] rmancy: and isn't that what Selenium-Core did?
[03:55:35] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Feb 19 04:04:59 2013]
[04:04:59] Dude-X_: rmancy, yes it calls the internal JS engine, but it's not sandboxed like it was in Selenium RC
[04:06:10] admc has joined #selenium
[04:26:24] rmancy: Dude-X_, I see.
[04:28:50] rmancy: I'm tempted to ask why it does not have to be sandboxed.
[04:32:14] Dude-X_: one useful thing is being able to execute arbitrary javascript
[04:33:23] rmancy: Dude-X_, yeah, I'm just doing a bit of reading here http://google-opensource.blogspot.com.au/2009/05/introducing-webdriver.html
[04:33:58] rmancy: Answers a few of my questions
[04:34:55] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[04:34:55] rmancy: I've never programmed an extension, but I'm assuming it doesn't suffer the same security sandboxing that Javascript does
[04:35:53] Dude-X_: the webdriver api is simpler than RC and it's constantly worked on. RC is no longer developed only maintained
[04:36:03] Dude-X_: in a few years it will be dropped from active development
[04:37:29] rmancy: Dude-X_, yep, I haven't written a Selenium (1.0) test in over a year and have been actively converting my existing ones. I'm just trying to get a grapple on the nuts and bolts that are diferent, and whilst I think I understand RC pretty well now I'm still trying to read up about the details of WebDriver
[04:38:41] Dude-X_: you may lose some of the simplicity that Selenium RC when you switch to Webdriver
[04:38:54] Dude-X_: but you will have more control in your tests

[06:41:47] newbieSel: i am using webdriver and creating a new project in Eclipse.
[06:41:59] newbieSel: do i need the java srcs bindingg jar file ?
[06:42:42] newbieSel: Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings
[06:42:46] newbieSel: Do we need these ?
[06:43:16] newbieSel: i just created a new project and added the selenium -server latest into build path and i was able to kick off tests.
[06:43:30] newbieSel: So What's the use of this language specific clients ?
[06:43:33] newbieSel: any one ?
[06:43:44] sassda has joined #selenium
[06:48:13] newbieSel: no one.. online to help ?
[06:51:45] rmancy: newbieSel, what did you write your tests in ?
[06:51:57] newbieSel: using java.
[06:52:16] newbieSel: and a simple google search.....program.
[06:52:36] newbieSel: there was no eroors and it was clean. Also the program executed very well.
[06:52:42] newbieSel: So What's the use of Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings
[06:56:36] rmancy: newbieSel, I'm not familiar with using java with selenium, but I would have thought that you would need the java client bindings if you are running against the RC
[06:57:40] newbieSel: ok so its not mandatory to use that for webdriver right ?
[06:59:35] rmancy: I would have assumed it was the same requirement.

[14:25:59] jimevans: barancev|2: i have native events for firefox 19 building on windows. i'm hesitant to check in for fear of breaking CI (which it *will* break)
[14:27:07] barancev: jimevans: FF19 is not deployed to sauce yet
[14:27:30] barancev: but we should not break anything
[14:27:33] jimevans: i'm well aware of that, which is why i brought it up.
[14:27:56] barancev: we need to create a new DLL version for FF17 as it's The New ESR
[14:28:39] barancev: we should support now 3.x (legacy), 10, 17, 18, 19 -- five DLLs
[14:29:36] barancev: jimevans: btw, please rebuild DLL for FF18 with the updated sdk 18.0.2
[14:31:17] jimevans: barancev: i've not touched the FF18 code. i'll need to update the SDK download.
[14:32:10] barancev: yes, no code changes, just change SDK url and checksum. and rebuild the DLL

[14:33:53] dawagner: jimevans: hi
[14:34:19] jimevans: dawagner: do you happen to know if eranm is around? i could use some guidance on some of the native event code he wrote for firefox.

[14:34:46] jimevans: well that's too bad.
[14:35:09] dawagner: He should be around later this week, but probably not today
[14:35:28] jimevans: it's not critical; i just want to ping him about some warnings i'm receiving from visual studio. i'll catch him  when i see him next.

[15:17:05] jimevans: firefox linux native event question. in chrome.manifest for the firefox extension, the binary-component file names for the linux so's are of the pattern "libwebdriver-firefox-latest.so". in the build.desc, it looks like the built file names are of the pattern "libwebdriver_firefox_latest.so" (underscores instead of hyphens). which is correct?
[15:17:54] jimevans: oh, never mind. the resources piece of crazy-fun renames the file.
[15:23:13] jimevans: okay, i think i'm completely ready to check in support for building FF19, once the ci environment supports it.

[16:42:00] qaguy: jimevans: Thanks. Is it due to hit soon?

[17:02:27] lukeis: and 13
[17:02:59] jimevans: the FF19 update broke even for synthetic events.

[17:16:22] intchanter-work: lukeis: Are you doing Python stuff in AT's absence?
[17:16:25] lukeis: the lack of people working on RC has expedited it's deprecationâ€¦ I would expect 3.0 around conference time

[18:50:32] jimevans: metroxylon: depends on what you're trying to do. if you're really wanting to send an <enter> keystroke, use element.sendKeys(). if you're looking for actual "keydown" for some reason, use the Actions class (or its equivalent in whatever language you're using)

[18:58:42] llaskin1: so I have an element that when you .clear it, it resets instead of clearing.  So it says $0.00 as the default value.  If I send_keys(10) to it, it becomes $0.0010.  How would you suggest making it into "10"?  Right now i've resorted to sending 5 backspaces to the element after a .clear(since I know that after a .clear it becomse the default value, no matter what)
[18:59:17] llaskin1: any suggestions?

[19:46:05] nirvdrum: *well
[19:46:13] jimevans: no, i fucked up the release yesterday.
[19:46:37] jimevans: or more correctly, fucked up the deploy.
[19:46:40] llaskin1: doh
[19:47:27] nirvdrum: jimevans: So am I running the correct version with a bad identifier?  Or is this actually the 2.29 binary?
[19:47:53] jimevans: no you're running the right one. the version identifier is bad. give me 10 minutes and i'll have a fix pushed.
[19:48:20] nirvdrum: No problem.  Just wondering if I should stop upgrading my grid :-P
[19:48:25] sejo: dude-x 4 G, 4 procs, and 100Mb line

[19:49:08] sejo: I wait like this:  WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(lambda driver: driver.find_element_by_tag_name('body'))

[20:27:35] dude-x: does the CI run tests for all language bindings?
[20:28:04] jimevans: no, just java.
[20:28:22] dude-x: so i take it when you deploy the .net bindings you run the .net tests?
[20:28:49] jimevans: in general, yes, but issues specific to language bindings are actually pretty rare these days.
[20:29:02] jimevans: at least among the "big four"
[20:29:49] dude-x: yeah
[20:30:13] barancev: they are not rare, but they are usually related to the browser startup code, that can't be tested on CI

[21:28:19] jrendell: Is this the appropriate channel to ask about IEDriver oddness? We just upgraded from 2.24 today to 2.30, and when running locally we no longer see IE show the webpage or the tests actionsâ€¦ although the test does pass.  Any suggestions (i.e. what did we do wrong? :) )
[21:29:26] jimevans: jrendell: can you use :gist to show the code that doesn't work?
[21:29:26] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[21:29:39] jimevans: also, what version of the IEDriverServer.exe are you using?
[21:31:51] jrendell: jimevans: code is working, just IE shows the IEDriver start page ("this s a dummy page loaded by IEDriverâ€¦") We just downloaded latest (2.30.1, win32) from the google code page.
[21:33:10] jimevans: okay, i needed to check about the IEDriverServer, many people when they upgraded from 2.24, didn't realize it was mandatory to use the IEDriverServer.exe
[21:33:48] jrendell: No problem.  I'm thinking we missed something obvious. Our tests are doing stuff- just IE isn't displaying it.
[21:34:19] jimevans: there's no setting that can make IE *not* display what it's doing.
[21:36:16] jrendell: That's what I thought.  Weird. I'm going to ask my colleague to restart his machine, then maybe check he's downloaded the correct bit version of the server.  If it continues, I'll try and create an isolated test case + video to show.  Thanks!
