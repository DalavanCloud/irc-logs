[06:01:01] Osleg: hello guys
[06:01:39] Osleg: i;m getting this error selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: 'The browser appears to have exited before we could connect. The output was: Error: cannot open display: :14614\n'
[06:01:51] intchanter: Osleg: Which OS?
[06:01:59] Osleg: and after th program fails - the browser starts
[06:02:09] Osleg: linux/centos with ff 17
[06:02:47] intchanter: :14614 is an unusual display number.
[06:02:54] Osleg: using Xvfb
[06:03:31] intchanter: Do the number Xvfb is running on and the number set in $DISPLAY match?
[06:04:33] Osleg: yes
[06:04:40] Osleg: it running ~30 tests
[06:04:45] Osleg: one after another
[06:05:05] Osleg: and on one of them it just fails to wait till the browser actually starts
[06:05:46] Osleg: on one random, it also never the same test
[06:06:02] intchanter: So each of them individually work?
[06:07:23] intchanter: I'm guessing a bit here, but it sounds like you may be looking at a timing issue where one browser hasn't fully exited before the next one starts up.
[06:07:46] intchanter: And the connection is attempted to one that is shutting down instead of the one that's starting.
[06:08:16] intchanter: One way to test that would be to temporarily introduce a delay between the cleanup of one test and the start of the next.
[06:09:12] intchanter: The more permanent solution if that appears to help would be to add logic ensuring that one has completely closed before continuing with the next.
[06:12:38] Osleg: intchanter: that sounds very logical, i will try to add some delay now, thanks :)

[14:22:05] RossPatterson: I for one welcome our new highly-polished-metallic overlords :-)
[14:22:15] RossPatterson: (as an opera user for many years)
[14:22:50] Ardesco: Does that mean Opera driver is going to merge with chromedriver2
[14:23:04] Ardesco: (if i remember right thats webkit based rather than chrome specific)
[14:23:09] andreastt: Unknown at this point.
[14:23:22] andreastt: But I imagine it would be trivial to get chromedriver working with the new Opera.
[14:23:39] RossPatterson: arex\: I don't know the MS unit-testing framework (we use NUnit for our tests), but it looks to me like you're doing it right and that you should only have one browser running at a time.
[14:24:14] andreastt: Ardesco: I should note that it's not on the roadmap though.
[14:24:28] Ardesco: andreastt: any idea when the first chromium based opera is planned to come out?
[14:24:44] simonstewart: Hopefully "immediately"
[14:24:44] barancev: recently Yandex launched a chromium-based browser., and I could run tests on it even with old chromedriver
[14:24:50] andreastt: We've been working on it for over six months.
[14:24:59] Ardesco: I guess the next question is will OperaDriver be updated to support the chromium based version of Opera?
[14:24:59] andreastt: But it's still far off, I think.  I can't really tell you a date.
[14:25:00] simonstewart: Because I've already heard people talk about dropping support for testing with opera
[14:25:20] andreastt: barancev: Yeah, you probably saw that Opera entered a partnership with Yandex a few months back …
[14:25:50] barancev: yes, I saw ,but I though it was search-related deal
[14:25:53] arex\: RossPatterson: i deleted some test settings files, and it seems to work. thanks again :)
[14:25:56] andreastt: Ardesco: Unsure.
[14:26:11] Ardesco: dammit, do you guys know anything… ;)
[14:26:25] andreastt: Ardesco: But that's an excellent question.
[14:26:50] Ardesco: I guess suck it and see
[14:27:03] andreastt: simonstewart: Yes, unless Opera implements and ships web standards before they get into WebKit proper, I guess there's no real reason to do so.
[14:27:16] Ardesco: and I'll probably push back against any requests to add Opera to our list of supported browsers now
[14:27:37] Ardesco: probably  to worth it as I'm guessing by the time we release Opera will have moved on
[14:27:40] simonstewart: andreastt: or if there are any differences in standards already implemented
[14:27:46] Ardesco: s/to/not/
[14:27:50] simonstewart: "flexbox" was mentioned on quirksmode
[14:28:08] andreastt: Yeah, I haven't really followed that discussion.
[14:28:18] *andreastt has been busy reimplementing our testing infrastructure
[14:29:04] simonstewart: It becomes a bit clearer why that's necessary
[14:29:06] andreastt: (It's pretty awesome FWIW.  In my opinion far superior to Chromium's.)
[14:29:19] simonstewart: What happens to opera's existing webdriver tests?
[14:29:45] simonstewart: Cripes, Mozilla
[14:29:53] andreastt: Our WebDriver-specific tests (through Watir) are very Presto-specific.
[14:30:01] simonstewart: :(
[14:30:10] Bebe_ has joined #selenium
[14:30:18] andreastt: But of the remainder of the tests (about 220k others), we might port some.
[14:30:24] andreastt: All of them use WebDriver as their backend currently.
[14:31:35] simonstewart: I know someone who's working on testing for the w3c who might be interested in taking a look at them
[14:31:55] mreedell_ has joined #selenium
[14:31:57] andreastt: Most of them are bug TCs.
[14:32:15] andreastt: So there's very likely a lot of Presto-specific tests, and a lot of repetition.
[14:32:37] andreastt: If the person signs an NDA, I'm pretty sure (s)he could have a look.
[14:32:49] andreastt: I think the long-term plan has always been to release all of the relevant ones.

[14:55:50] aimbire: Ardesco: problem solved! lol
[14:56:09] RossPatterson: arex\: That depends entirely on what happens when you click().
[14:57:03] Ardesco: RossPatterson: how long does it take to run in IE8 ?
[14:57:05] Ardesco: ;)
[14:57:39] RossPatterson: arex\: It's entirely possible that your click() operation invalidates the WebElements you've already obtained.

[15:25:34] Phil37: anyone know if there's a way to grab the xpath from a By object created using By.xpath()?
[15:26:29] simonstewart: There isn't
[15:27:02] Phil37: alrighty
[15:27:52] simonstewart: How come?
[15:28:28] rpereira_ has joined #selenium
[15:28:54] Phil37: we're passing WebElements between classes so dont have the original xpath at hand when we're trying to find other elements based on the original element
[15:29:30] Phil37: we can still do what we want but it wouldve been convient for there to be a way to get it
[15:30:11] Phil37: conveniant*
[15:30:32] simonstewart: Why not just pass the By?
[15:31:22] Phil37: we're doing something like element2 = element.findElement(By.xpath(".//span/span")
[15:31:51] simonstewart: The argument about the By stands....
[15:32:17] Phil37: and if it causes a nosuchelement exception we run the same line but with .//a/span instead
[15:32:42] simonstewart: Jeepers.
[15:32:46] Phil37: as elements we need to rightclick for a certain contextual menu to appear varies depending on the table we're interacting with and the columns it looks like
[15:33:07] Phil37: so if we had the original xpath we mightve found a cleaner way to do it
[15:33:17] Phil37: atm we have a try catch inside a try catch
[15:33:18] simonstewart: Phil37: the less than helpful answer is to say that you should be aware of the context you're doing the search in and just use the right locator
[15:33:24] simonstewart: That's not particularly helpful though
[15:33:31] Phil37: ye
[15:33:35] Phil37: appreciate it nonetheless
[15:33:36] simonstewart: You could try to use two child locators
[15:34:11] simonstewart: By.xpath(".//span") followed by By.xpath(".//span")
[15:34:24] zeljkof_ has joined #selenium
[15:34:32] simonstewart: and it that fails, try By.xpath(".//a") follewed by By.xpath(".//span")
[15:34:35] matthewrobbins has joined #selenium
[15:34:44] simonstewart: So rather than passing the whole xpath and munging, pass the pieces
[15:34:47] simonstewart: Would that work?
[15:35:23] Phil37: i dont see any reason why it wouldn't but it looks to be a more verbose way of doing what we're already doing
[15:35:37] Phil37: im just a placement student though so take my opinion with a few kilos of salt
[15:36:01] RossPatterson: locator =By.xpath(".//span/span); try { element2 = element.findElement(locator) } catch { locator = By.xpath(".//a/span"); element2=element.findElement(locator); }
[15:36:09] simonstewart: You can gussy it up to look nice
[15:37:19] Phil37: ill show you what we've got here, thx ross i will look at that
[15:38:55] Phil37: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/83e6e07c5684f22c234e
[15:39:44] Ardesco: think i have something that would kind of do it Phil37 
[15:39:51] Phil37: should be noted that sometimes all thats needed is to right click on the raw element, this piece of code is meant to handle any situation
[15:39:57] Phil37: really ardesco?
[15:40:38] Ardesco: https://github.com/Ardesco/Powder-Monkey/blob/master/src/main/java/com/lazerycode/selenium/tools/WebElementTools.java
[15:40:53] Phil37: these tests will be run by testers with little coding experiance so the framework tries to handle special cases like this by itself
[15:42:21] Phil37: this looks great, you had this to hand?
[15:42:25] Ardesco: generally if testers have little coding exp don't expect them to write automated tests
[15:42:31] Ardesco: let manual testers be manual testers
[15:42:41] Ardesco: if they want to be automated testers each them how to code
[15:42:46] Phil37: if i had it my way id do it your way
[15:43:07] simonstewart: :gist
[15:43:08] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[15:43:14] Ardesco: and you can do what you want by passing the webElement around and calling findElements() on it
[15:43:19] simonstewart: Phil37: https://gist.github.com/shs96c/4945539
[15:43:58] Ardesco: yeah I had that to hand, I don't use it.  It was something I wrote to see if it could be done\
[15:44:07] Phil37: its really useful ty
[15:44:33] Phil37: and that method looks like a better way to do things
[15:44:45] Phil37: easier to expand the list of things we look out for too
[15:46:58] simonstewart: I'd throw a hissy fit if that landed in my code, and would ask for the parameters to be reversed
[15:47:02] simonstewart: But it serves to show the idea
[15:47:07] Phil37: yeye i get it

[16:25:54] intchanter-work: You could respond asking them to re-read their support contract with you.
[16:26:02] Phil37: my ancestry evolved such that we lost our ability to give shits many generations ago
[16:26:07] intchanter-work: I'm sure they'll find that any response you give is well within the stated time frame.
[16:26:15] Ardesco: maybe I should say his support contract has been revoked due to non-payment
[16:26:32] garndt: heh
[16:27:10] medwards: hmm, when I do driver.get('http://deliveryhero.com.au') against a remote IE driver I end up with a BadStatusLine but it looks like it loaded fine in Sauce :/
[16:27:28] intchanter-work: Would someone remind me what competitive advantages Opera has over any browser but IE?
[16:27:55] Ardesco: intchanter: bloody useful if you have a very old phone

[16:28:29] lukeis has joined #selenium
[16:29:32] Ardesco: probably because opera was on all mobile phones a while back
[16:29:38] medwards: Ardesco: everything but IE is big here. I was shocked to see IE under 15% on our DE site.
[16:30:06] intchanter-work: Amazing what can happen when it stops being bundled as the default.
[16:30:37] jimevans: lukeis: yeah, so your automated SO upvoting was reverted today. :)
[16:30:52] Ardesco: heh
[16:31:14] Ardesco: need to run it again with a bigger wait between pages
[16:31:16] Ardesco: :P
[16:31:21] lukeis: jimevans: ahhh :(
[16:31:35] medwards: flip-side is older versions of modernizr crashed because a lot of media codecs weren't allowed to be bundled with with Windows in EU. (fixed now, but was a problem for us when we started using SauceLabs)
[16:32:00] medwards: Anyways, BadStatusLine in IEDriver, is there a separate project or should I just file a defect?

[16:32:54] *jimevans has never seen a "BadStatusLine" from the IE driver.
[16:34:04] RossPatterson: interchanter-work: Opera deals with REALLY large numbers of tabs very well, is quite lightweight and speedy, and does a great job of not downloading malware onto my machine.  Unlike Firefox and Chrome, which have both done that to me repeatedly
[16:36:23] intchanter-work: RossPatterson: Good data point, thanks!
[16:39:09] medwards: jimevans: just use an iedriver and do .get('http://deliveryhero.com.au')?
[16:39:26] jimevans: medwards: locally, or remote?
[16:39:32] medwards: I do it remotely
[16:39:38] lukeis: and which version of IE? :)
[16:39:42] medwards: ah good q
[16:39:46] jimevans: does it reproduce locally? and which version of IE?
[16:39:49] medwards: IE9 against Windows 2008 (or 7)
[16:39:55] medwards: I am on Linux, can't really repro locally :/
[16:40:30] jimevans: I'm on OS X, but i do so with regularity (thanks to VMs)
[16:41:12] dude-x: RossPatterson: lots of tabs on opera works well? i think i might swtich. do you use a mac?
[16:42:01] medwards: based on the logs I'm also settign implicitly_wait to 5s. I'll re-test without it just be sure that isn't the problem
[16:42:33] RossPatterson: dude-x: Nope.  A variety of Windows machines
[16:42:46] medwards: my desired_capabilities btw: {'browser': 'internetexplorer', 'platform': 'Windows 2008', 'version': '9'}
[16:43:47] RossPatterson: Put it this way: I don't keep bookmarks, I keep tabs.  My main Opera window has 46 tabs right now.
[16:44:29] RossPatterson: I have a second Opera window with only a few tabs on a second monitor (dashboard stuff)
[16:45:19] medwards: jimevans: Ah the selenium-server log got posted: https://gist.github.com/medwards/5fee1ce8241ccc460c9d according to the Sauce-ified log output the get and implicit wait failed. I don't know how it gets that from the logs tho
[16:48:39] jimevans: medwards: the browser is never achieving a ready state of "complete"
[16:49:03] medwards: Like its still loading on yours?
[16:49:32] medwards: hrm. That happened in a few cases to me too but it also timed out if the page appeared to be finished loading (based on indicators in IE aka the spinner)
[16:49:51] Phil37: thx to everyone who helped me today
[16:49:57] jimevans: just because the page looks like it's finished loading, doesn't mean it actually is.
[16:50:29] jimevans: (hence the reason "waitForPageToLoad" is such a bitch to try to code correctly)
[16:50:53] medwards: urgh
[16:51:03] medwards: I betcha somebody added some kind of mofo-ing tracking pixel...
[16:51:07] medwards: now I get to figure out what it is...

[16:51:16] medwards: colour me excited.
[16:51:18] annette has left #selenium
[16:52:47] jimevans: there are at least two 1x1 pixel <img> tags in the page, just as direct children of the <body> element.
[16:55:13] medwards: I'm looking at output in the tunnel vm and a front-page load results in at least 10 other requests for tracking/advertisers/etc.
[16:57:17] medwards: anyways, my problem now. Thanks jimevans 
[16:57:24] jimevans: np
[16:58:02] jimevans: medwards: theoretically, you could also set the page load timeout, catch the exception, and proceed from there.

[17:14:14] barancev: people can't find 2.29 because seleniumhq.org tells the latest version is 2.28
[17:14:26] simonstewart: barancev: one bottleneck was the problem of updating the dns records
[17:14:35] simonstewart: lukeis and I both had a head scratch about that
[17:14:38] lukeis: direct them to www.seleniumhq.org

[17:39:40] andreastt: jimevans: Specifically?
[17:40:36] jimevans: andreastt: there's a slim chance that the still-under-development new chromedriver can be generalized into a "generic webkit driver", depending on how things shake out.
[17:41:01] jimevans: not that i don't appreciate the existing operadriver, but, you know, java. :)
[17:41:30] andreastt: Yeah, kkania mentioned that it is mostly really a WebKit thing, but that the only reason he hadn't put it up for inclusion there was the overhead of CR for development.
[17:41:36] lukeis: java's the best ;)
[17:41:36] jleyba: jimevans: that won't be possible
[17:41:40] andreastt: Due to where the DevTools protocol moved.
[17:41:54] andreastt: But I don't know the details.
[17:41:57] jleyba: a good portion of the new chromedriver will use devtools, but there's a sizable chunk that is chrome specific
[17:42:06] lukeis: jimevans: more likely we'll be able to use what françois has done with ios-driver
[17:42:19] lukeis: but that's java ;)
[17:42:31] jimevans: lukeis: i was thinking mostly of desktop, not mobile.
[17:42:53] lukeis: it applies to both
[17:42:54] andreastt: jimevans: (BTW, there's no good reason we couldn't have written an operadriver in another language.  It was just about implementing the right protocol calls.)
[17:42:59] jimevans: jleyba: that's incredibly disappointing.
[17:43:16] andreastt: jleyba: Apart from the listening interfaces, which parts do you think of?
[17:44:14] jleyba: off the top of my head, screenshots is the big one

[17:44:50] jleyba: <rant>I really, really hate Selenium RC</rant>
[17:44:56] lukeis: jimevans: in case you didn't know, françois has (reverse engineered due to undocumented features) the remote protocol and is using that mostly for 'mobile safari'… no reason that couldn't be used for any webkit based browser exposing the remote debugger
[17:45:02] andreastt: jleyba: Here, have some sympathy!
[17:45:19] *jleyba is working on deploying server-side webdriver-backed selenium without the selenium rc server
[17:45:37] jimevans: andreastt: if i could use the "sharpen" tool to do a bulk translation from java to c#, but the use of enums in the java code confuses sharpen to no end.

[17:49:03] jimevans: barancev: sorry, but don't care. if i'm a .NET shop, i don't want the java runtime, if i can avoid it. :)
[17:49:23] simonstewart: What's the problem?
[17:49:26] simonstewart: Also, why?
[17:49:47] jleyba: The usual difference in semantics b/w selenium and webdriver (e.g. element visibility)
[17:49:57] simonstewart: oh. ffs
[17:50:03] barancev: if you're a .net shop why can't you build a grid from linux servers, no need to pay for WinServer licenses
[17:50:05] simonstewart: we can fix that if it's a crazy problem
[17:51:07] AlbinoGeek: Windows Server 2012 has much better licensing.
[17:51:15] AlbinoGeek: Just saying.
[17:52:06] barancev: does Java cures and corrupts .net shops so much that they feel fear just to install Java runtime? :)

[18:17:32] barancev: lukeis: already starred
[18:17:53] AlbinoGeek: git is great.
[18:18:03] AlbinoGeek: Why: sub-modules
[18:18:06] AlbinoGeek: Why: rebasing

[18:18:24] barancev: s/start/stars/
[18:18:47] simonstewart: barancev: apparently we'll get a lot contributions
[18:18:52] lukeis: we don't use sub-modules (yet… although I should convert a couple now!)
[18:18:57] arex\: Why: easy and fast branching and merging
[18:19:07] barancev: we don't branch
[18:19:09] arex\: Why: working offline
[18:19:16] barancev: we don't need rebasing
[18:19:20] lukeis: simonstewart: we've got some :)
[18:19:31] simonstewart: I'm not convinced it's more than we had before
[18:19:33] AlbinoGeek: ie: each remote module should be a different module, or repo.  The docs should be one, etc etc etc.
[18:19:35] barancev: we (I) don't commit when offline
[18:20:00] AlbinoGeek: You will branch, when other people start wanting to commit (which never happens with SVN by the way, community commits.)
[18:20:02] lukeis: easier to apply a contributors patch :)
[18:20:02] phishy has joined #selenium
[18:20:08] AlbinoGeek: "pull requests" and patches.
[18:20:13] barancev: yes, I could *code* offline even with SVN, I'm a superman!
[18:20:26] simonstewart: lukeis: I'm not entirely convinced by that, given how much futzing I do when applying a PR
[18:20:37] lukeis: ah…it's easier for me
[18:20:44] AlbinoGeek: barancev: Yes, but with offline commits you can keep track of which changes were all towards one issue, add those files and make a commit specific to that; and keep coding even without pushing.
[18:21:00] simonstewart: AlbinoGeek: did you ever see changesets in svn?
[18:21:01] arex\: ^- this guy gets it
[18:21:01] barancev: I know how to diff, patches can live this format
[18:21:08] AlbinoGeek: simonstewart: I did, I hated it :x
[18:21:09] lukeis: simonstewart: I (very often) can't cleanly apply a patch attached to the issue tracker… even with updating to their svn revision
[18:21:33] barancev: AlbinoGeek: Eclipse has local history, and I can go back even without commiting changes
[18:21:47] AlbinoGeek: The issue with patches, is that if any work was applied after the source of the patch... it's hard to apply without losing changes.
[18:22:16] qaguy has joined #selenium
[18:22:34] barancev: we don't have SO many patches (yes, *apparently* we will, after migration. yes, yes!)
[18:23:15] AlbinoGeek: ie:  build81 userB finds "X" that needs to be fixed, however; by the time he makes a patch we're on build94.  You try to apply the patch on build94 and find the files userB's patch touches are now incompatible...
[18:23:17] AlbinoGeek: Solution ?
[18:23:39] lukeis: well, i am happy that the sites are in separate repos now :)
[18:24:20] barancev: AlbinoGeek: you I know in git it is easier, but *everyday* live is harder
[18:24:38] barancev: I'd be very glad to just apply patches and rebase, and commit
[18:24:38] AlbinoGeek: barancev: I'm not saying patches are any easier in git :P
[18:25:04] AlbinoGeek: In git the user should do a pull request instead of submitting a patch.
[18:25:28] dude-x: whoa debit card is an anagram for bad credit
[18:25:30] barancev: the only real argument I can see is that it's easier for lukeis :)
[18:25:31] *dude-x mind is blown.
[18:25:34] AlbinoGeek: It's an unauthorized commit that an authenticated author of the repo has to approve and push, but it happily merges with any number of changes.

[20:12:17] garndt: is there a preferred way of taking screenshots on windows vms that are locked?  Screenshots appear black.  
[20:13:44] aweiteka has joined #selenium
[20:13:59] KaibutsuX: if it's locked, how do you plan on using it?
[20:14:50] garndt: it's running the script.  The machine auto locks after a certain time period.  It also locks when you disconnect from RDP.
[20:15:26] garndt: appears this might be a workaround: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=3536#c9
[20:17:20] KaibutsuX: ahhh, sorry never ran into that, i don't think our vms lock

[20:42:58] qaguy has left #selenium
[20:43:49] garndt: jimevans: what should I not be doing? Connecting via RDP to execute the tests?
[20:45:09] garndt: I do need to look into using selenium grid
[20:45:19] jimevans: garndt: two things. first, don't let your VMs lock. second, attach to the console session of the OS, if applicable (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/278845)
[20:45:56] garndt: two things I can't control because of a restrictive group policy
[20:47:12] barancev: garndt: use VNC instead of RDP, and keep session active
[20:48:03] barancev: or build the grid on linux machines, cheaper and better :)
[20:48:15] barancev: sorry, jimevans :)
[20:48:30] garndt: I would if our only supported platform was IE and Windows
[20:48:36] garndt: s/was/wasn't/
[20:49:16] p_l: garndt: oh, another in my position :D
[20:49:22] garndt: regardless of the problems I have now, I would probably use VNC anyways if it weren't for IT restricting it.
[20:49:48] jimevans: barancev: as the designated MSFT apologist in this (and just about every other OSS project) community, i'm used to being told that i'm an idiot. it's usually true, too.
[20:49:52] garndt: I also would prefer not to have console sessions that are never locked
[20:50:20] jimevans: garndt: then forget about screenshots. sorry, but that's just the way the windows PrintWindow() api works.
[20:50:48] jimevans: one can only do on windows what the windows api allows one to do.
[20:51:22] barancev: jimevans: as a self-designated Java apologint I claim my win :)
[20:51:38] p_l: jimevans: ... unless you extend the API...
[20:51:41] *p_l ducks
[20:52:06] jimevans: p_l: nope, that works when you control the basis of the api, but in the case of the OS, you don't have that luxury.
[20:52:44] p_l: jimevans: well, in this case it would depend on what would be the exact definition of "unlocked VM"
[20:53:05] garndt: jimevans: I was not asking for apologies for the way it is.  Seems it put you on the defensive about it, which I was not trying to do.  I was only asking if there was a preferred way.  If this is just the limitation then so be it.
[20:53:10] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[20:53:11] garndt: So..sorry ;)
[20:53:23] garndt: O dodnmt'
[20:53:29] garndt: er, damn keyboard
[20:53:42] garndt: would help if I put the fingers on the right keys
[20:53:45] p_l: jimevans: it's at least theoretically possible to inject display stack that can simulate console session being still open when you disconnect from RDP (i.e. simulating the case of someone physically taking over)
[20:53:46] jimevans: garndt: not really being defensive, though i am prone to be so.
[20:54:50] garndt: jimevans: I've noticed, which is why I try to be very careful when asking questions.  heh
[20:55:54] barancev: jimevans: are there something like xvfb for windows? how do they implement "multiscreen"? apps like dexpot or virtualwin?
[20:56:03] jimevans: i've taken a lot of hits over the problems in the IE driver. i *know* the code in it is shitty. i've gotten to the point where i'm starting to feel that if one is going to dump on that code, either don't use it or be constructive and patch it.
[20:56:27] jimevans: barancev: i have no idea. could be using terminal services.
[20:56:29] garndt: jimevans: understood
[20:56:51] p_l: barancev: what kind of "multiscreen"?
[20:56:58] p_l: You mean multiple users on single machine?
[20:57:19] barancev: virtual desktops -- http://virtuawin.sourceforge.net/
[20:58:09] jimevans: garndt: having said that, if there's a legitimate problem, i'm happy to fix it, but i can't fix what i can't reproduce, and being pissy about it doesn't help. (note, i'm not talking about you, at all, just venting my frustration at some of the [sometimes truly nasty] comments i've received in the past)
[20:58:43] garndt: jimevans: I understand (and empathize) 
[20:58:49] p_l: barancev: ah, that. No idea, really, but I suspect similarly how it's done on X11 (i.e., you just "unmap" the windows that aren't on the screen you are currently displaying)
[20:59:28] barancev: xvfb does not unmap windows, it just another X11-server, a virtual one
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Feb 13 21:00:20 2013]
[21:00:20] barancev: but, yes, for virtual desktops one x11-server is enough, you're right
[21:00:53] barancev: btw, there is an "official" virtual desktop manager from MS -- http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc817881.aspx
[21:00:56] p_l: barancev: XVFB and "virtual desktops" in meaning of virtuawin are completely different beasts
[21:01:12] p_l: and virtual desktops for windows was included in MS Plus at some point :)
[21:01:26] barancev: sure, they are completely different
[21:03:28] p_l: as for multiple user sessions, NT since NT for Terminal Services? maybe even earlier, supports creation of multiple "desktop" objects, with apropriate complete "login session" objects
[21:03:45] p_l: GUI etc. operates on current "Desktop"
[21:03:49] p_l: at least that's what I recall
[21:04:09] garndt: jimevans: where does one begin with understanding the IE driver to the point of being able to help rather than ask random questions?  I have looked at the source, but unfortunately I know almost no c++ (I know you hear the C++ excuse all the time.  I am not unwilling to learn) and have very little insight to how it's all tied together and working.
[21:05:04] jimevans: garndt: here's a scary (not-so-) secret. i'm not a c++ developer.
[21:05:24] *lukeis shocked

[21:06:11] jimevans: :D
[21:07:20] p_l: barancev: anyway, GDI (and on nt6, DWM) calls are intercepted when the session is connected remotely
[21:08:47] sassda has joined #selenium
[21:08:52] jimevans: garndt: but seriously, understanding the IE driver is, i hope, not too hard. i'm happy to answer any questions you might have. the vast majority of the work takes place in the command handlers (*CommandHandler.h). each webdriver json wire protocol command eventually finds its way down into its corresponding command handler.
[21:09:03] smccarthy has joined #selenium
[21:09:07] garndt: jimevans: Nor did I claim that you were one. (and I know it's not a secret)
[21:09:35] garndt: jimevans: ok
[21:09:39] garndt: jimevans: thanks.
[21:10:04] jimevans: and it relies heavily on the "automation atoms", which are javascript code that gets turned into string constants in the header files, and used to execute some of the functions of the driver.
[21:10:57] jimevans: (which, incidentally, is one reason the IE driver is so damned slow - the IE javascript engine, particularly before IE9, is an incredibly poor performer) 
[21:13:14] jleyba: Hmmm...should we change the status on the JsonWireProtocol wiki?  It's not really a draft anymore
[21:13:37] jleyba: Maybe "living standard" and link to the W3C spec?
[21:13:48] santiycr has joined #selenium
[21:15:31] arex\: If a click of a button in a table row removes that table row, would finding all elements and clicking them in a loop lead to a StaleElementReferenceException? Is it preferrable to find and click the elements one by one?
[21:16:22] jimevans: jleyba: well, the JSON wire protocol is not normative in the W3C spec sense. it's a potential implementation of that spec, but the spec doesn't demand a specific transport mechanism.
[21:17:13] jimevans: arex\: it could. since the click of the button is manipulating the DOM (removing a table row), there's a possibility that's not *all* that it's modifying, and could cause other element references to become invalid.
[21:17:23] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[21:17:41] barancev: santiycr: which FF10 version do you use in sauce cloud, exactly?
[21:17:49] jleyba: jimevans: right, it's an implementation of the W3C spec, but it's not a draft in its own right.  we rarely change it
[21:17:52] arex\: jimevans: http://pastie.org/private/srexdsh8mdy5zqfwdbdxbg
[21:18:20] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[21:18:21] barancev: jleyba: there was a suggestion to add "batch actions"
[21:18:27] arex\: jimevans: How can the reference become invalid? Is it only if the element disappears from the DOM?
[21:19:33] jimevans: arex\: typically yes, but if, for example, clicking the button would delete and re-add the table without the row, then all other elements would no longer be valid, right? i don't know if that's what your page is doing, and it's impossible to tell that just by looking at your webdriver code.
[21:19:50] arex\: jimevans: Ok, I understand. Thanks :)
[21:20:14] jimevans: additionally, if i had to guess, your site also probably uses jquery, so it might be difficult to actually figure out exactly what DOM manipulation is occurring.
[21:20:37] *jimevans was looking for an excuse to try out his psychic debugging powers today
[21:21:05] arex\: hehe, we do not
[21:21:27] arex\: but similar stuff, so your point still stands

[21:30:17] jimevans: santiycr: did we ever make any attempt to track down what was causing the IE6 javascript test failures in the CI environment?

[21:30:40] santiycr: in Win 7 -> 10.0.2

[21:31:47] santiycr: jimevans:  not really
[21:31:54] santiycr: It crashed the browser, right?
[21:32:18] jimevans: i dunno. maybe?
[21:32:36] jimevans: i haven't investigated it to any real degree.
[21:32:40] santiycr: I'm wondering if this is connected to the regedits that we apply
[21:32:51] jimevans: i was just hoping somebody would've done the legwork already. :)
[21:32:59] santiycr: jimevans:  did you get to skim through those?
[21:33:05] santiycr: (regedits)
