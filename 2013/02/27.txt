[00:54:36] kentor: I'm trying to retrieve a JS value of a variable but am having trouble... I can get the value if I do: String sgVal1 = (String) js.executeScript("alert(initted);"); but this creates a popup.... if I just do String sgVal1 = (String) js.executeScript("return initted;"); I get an exception
[00:54:53] kentor: any idea how to get the value of that variable in java?
[00:57:03] dude-x: kentor: that seems to be the right way...
[00:57:16] kentor: =/
[00:57:31] dude-x: can you play with ruby/python webdriver?
[00:57:50] dude-x: or even something like firebug or the console debugger?

[01:01:37] kentor: I could, how?
[01:01:39] kentor: what should I try
[01:05:02] dude-x: in python: from selenium import webdriver
[01:05:14] dude-x: d = webdriver.Firefox() # or whatever browser you're testing
[01:05:20] kentor: oh wow it works like this:
[01:05:26] kentor: Object val1 = js.executeScript("return initted;");
[01:05:28] dude-x: when the browser opens up, navigate manually to the page you're working on
[01:05:38] kentor: i shouldn't have been casting it to a String
[01:05:39] kentor: weird
[01:05:53] dude-x: oh that makes sense actually
[01:06:13] dude-x: actually what you wrote should work too
[01:06:22] kentor: yea thats what i thought
[01:06:22] dude-x: but are you getting the right value?
[01:06:32] kentor: let me check one sec
[01:06:37] dude-x: maybe you're getting back an integer
[01:06:45] dude-x: which in that case you should cast to an Integer
[01:07:05] dude-x: if innited is an integer value then you should cast to an integer first
[01:07:13] dude-x: because the Java code will return an integer
[01:07:21] mreedell has joined #selenium
[01:07:50] dude-x: however it might be safer to store the returned value as an object then do some checking if its the right type
[01:08:06] dude-x: so if you get Null or your program won't blow up stupidly
[01:08:18] plightbo has joined #selenium
[01:08:25] dude-x: one thing i like about dynamic languages it makes working with selenium a lot easier
[01:08:48] dude-x: no need to use AugmentedWebdriver to take screenshots with RemoteWebdriver as in java
[01:09:40] kentor: ok just finished testing, it is returning the correct value
[01:10:01] dude-x: as a string?
[01:10:03] kentor: im just receiving it as an object
[01:10:06] kentor: so thats good
[01:10:16] kentor: and in js, it is an int
[01:10:24] dude-x: you can't cast to string then
[01:10:27] kentor: sorry no
[01:10:28] kentor: its a boolean
[01:10:37] dude-x: you can't cast to string, you cast to Boolean
[01:10:44] dude-x: that should work
[01:11:07] kentor: i just don't cast and store as object
[01:11:09] dude-x: executescript will return Boolean if it's a bool (true/false), Integer if it's an int, and String ''
[01:11:09] kentor: and then i can do anything
[01:11:17] dude-x: yeah but then Eclipse will complain
[01:11:21] kentor: ok thats awesome
[01:11:26] kentor: eclipse seems fine with it
[01:11:26] kentor: :)
[01:11:42] dude-x: also you're expecting a boolean so it's better to state to other programmers that you expect a bool and not just some random object
[01:11:50] kentor: yes for sure
[01:11:51] kentor: i agree
[01:11:56] kentor: im just doing POC right now
[01:11:57] kentor: :)
[01:12:03] dude-x: cool

[07:17:02] barancev|2 has joined #selenium
[07:19:23] jeichar has joined #selenium
[07:19:26] Applejack_: I'm trying to get the response times for certain requests that occur when an action is performed on our site. Firebug has been great for this when manually testing, as I can see the exactly how many seconds each network action takes to complete. However, I cannot figure out how to accomplish something similar to this through selenium.
[07:19:56] barancev|2: selenium api does not provide this kind of information
[07:20:20] barancev|2: use browsermob proxy to accompain selenium
[07:21:26] barancev|2: browsermob proxy will catch all the traffic and store info in HAR format that you can analyze to get responce time (as well as many other usefull data)
[07:21:57] Applejack_: Would that work if we are coding in C#? (sorry, I'm pretty new to this)
[07:23:08] Manoj_: right, barancev:
[07:23:21] Manoj_: Applejack: its possible,
[07:23:30] Manoj_: this would help you out. http://assertselenium.com/2012/11/02/performance-data-collection-using-browsermob-proxy-and-selenium/
[07:23:58] Manoj_: it can be done in Python, Java and C#
[07:24:05] barancev: yes, as Manoj_ told
[07:24:08] Manoj_: i have added a sample C# code there
[07:24:55] Applejack_: Awesome! I'll go dig into the documentation. Thank you very much for the help :)
[07:24:56] Manoj_: Applejack_: visit the blog and try out its pretty simple set up....
[07:39:52] cmyster: Hi, I am trying selenium and I can't find something specific. I have a simple username/password dialog and a respon1se (predefined string). I was able to record the user name password typing but how can I ask it to check a specific span? 
[07:40:38] cmyster: I know how to write the if in paything or whatever, I am looking for the page to do it in (firefox with the ide plug)
[07:41:00] cmyster: python*
[07:43:48] cmyster: never mind, I exported as a python file. (is there a better way?)
[07:45:30] admc has joined #selenium
[07:46:26] Manoj_: cmyster: are you trying to validate the response (the predefined string) ?
[07:46:38] cmyster: Manoj_: I am
[07:47:20] Manoj_: there is a StoreText Api in selenium IDE and the same will be as getText() in webdriver which will return a string 
[07:47:35] Manoj_: and then you can compare the returned string with the predefined one.
[07:48:02] cmyster: so find element by id, getText it and compare sort of thing ?
[07:49:20] Manoj_: yes
[07:49:46] cmyster: figured as much, thanks
[07:49:50] Manoj_: or just a AssertText - based on your needs.
[07:50:06] Manoj_: cool. thanks for trying selenium.
[07:50:18] cmyster: still no idea what those are, I'll need to go over the API
[07:56:39] Manoj_: cmyster: yes, you will get a better idea when you look at them.
[07:57:27] Manoj_: i dont know whether is this the updated one... for selenium IDE reference,, http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-core/1.0.1/reference.html
[07:57:43] Manoj_: for webdriver api docs :apidocs

[14:43:20] nirvdrum: jimevans: I don't suppose you've tested much with IE 10 yet, have you?
[14:43:45] jimevans: nirvdrum: only what's been in the CI server, and since yesterday.
[14:43:49] nirvdrum: Ahh.
[14:44:01] nirvdrum: Okay.  Well, screenshots are busted.  I'm looking into it now.
[14:44:01] jimevans: screenshots are broken, and always have been.
[14:44:15] nirvdrum: The technique still works fine (I do something similar in a Safari plugin).
[14:44:18] jimevans: (at least on windows 8)
[14:44:29] jimevans: that's windows 8
[14:44:36] p_l: what about screenshots on xp with ie7-8?
[14:44:37] jimevans: i've not tried on windows 7 yet.
[14:44:38] nirvdrum: Well, it's working in Safari on Windows 8.
[14:44:58] *adamgoucher has reached a limit of his php clue -- kinda amazing it took this long
[14:45:06] nirvdrum: So, the windows hook trick works generally.  I suspect IE just isn't painting when requested.
[14:45:20] jimevans: nirvdrum: i'd guess you're probably right.
[14:45:46] nirvdrum: I guess I'll have to clone my VM and see if it works in IE 10 on Win 7.
[14:46:04] jimevans: i've got IE10 locally now. i can check it pretty quickly.
[14:48:06] nirvdrum: I usually use http://nirvdrum.com/2010/03/25/how-to-take-full-page-or-full-canvas-screenshots-in-windows.html as my test.
[14:48:19] nirvdrum: It's really long.  And it's funny to test the technique on the page where I describe it.

[15:03:22] nirvdrum: jimevans: Good to know.  That may give me an out for now :-P
[15:03:36] nirvdrum: I'll investigate Win 8 + IE 10.
[15:03:57] jimevans: what's the symptom? a completely blank image? or something else?
[15:04:16] nirvdrum: It gets the part in the current viewport.  The rest is black.
[15:04:40] nirvdrum: The height of the image is correct though.
[15:05:20] rpereir__ has joined #selenium
[15:05:33] nirvdrum: I was afraid it was a Win 8 problem.  But, like I said, I was able to run Safari on Win 8 and get the canvas.  It's basically a port of SnapsIE to NPAPI.
[15:05:48] nirvdrum: And that worked fine.
[15:07:39] jimevans: i just tried it with the macbeth page from the project tests (which is too big to get a full screenshot, but will get the maximum size of 64K pixels high), and i'm getting no blanks. the screenshot is being generated.
[15:08:37] nirvdrum: Cool.  So, that's IE 10 + Win 7?
[15:09:06] jimevans: correct.
[15:10:09] jimevans: of course, that's only one data point.
[15:13:09] nirvdrum: I cloned my VM.  Trying it out now.

[15:36:17] jimevans: nirvdrum: one sec.
[15:36:56] jimevans: nirvdrum: nope, i get a full screenshot.
[15:37:17] nirvdrum: Hmm . . .
[15:37:25] nirvdrum: What version of IEDriverServer are you using?
[15:37:55] jimevans: i'm using the tip of the tree. 
[15:38:26] nirvdrum: Okay.  I can build that.  But my guess is the screenshot code hasn't been touched in a while.
[15:38:38] nirvdrum: I'm running 2.30.2.  I'm not sure what's going on.
[15:38:40] jimevans: no, it's not been touched in quite some time.
[15:38:52] andreastt: AutomatedTester: You can have 47 weeks leave if you choose to have 100 % pay, or 57 weeks if you go down to 80 % pay.  The first 6 weeks are reserved the mother, and the rest can be split 50/50 between father/mother.  The father is required to take 12 weeks of leave.
[15:38:55] jimevans: 2.30.2 is pretty close
[15:39:33] simonstewart: andreastt: bloody hell. I got two weeks at full pay
[15:39:45] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: I get 4 weeks full pay...
[15:39:46] andreastt: Heh.
[15:39:49] nirvdrum: jimevans: And you're running 32-bit?
[15:39:55] jimevans: yes, sir.\
[15:40:01] nirvdrum: Thanks.
[15:40:26] jimevans: oh, wait, no i'm mistaken. i'm running 64-bit.
[15:40:41] andreastt: AutomatedTester: If you wanted, you could then technically be home with the child for 51 weeks if the mother agrees to it.
[15:40:51] jimevans: 2.30.2.2.
[15:41:13] AutomatedTester: andreastt: http://www.norway.org.uk/aboutnorway/society/welfare/benefits/ suggests that the father could only do 49 weeks max
[15:41:19] andreastt: AutomatedTester: The law was changed a couple of years ago to favour the man.
[15:41:30] andreastt: Ah okay.
[15:41:30] AutomatedTester: andreastt: its still brilliant :)
[15:41:36] llaskin: andreastt: HOLY CRAP
[15:41:37] andreastt: There may be other limitations.
[15:42:11] AutomatedTester: andreastt: the UK has a sliding scale for maternity leave from 90% to 0 over the course of a year
[15:42:18] AutomatedTester: and fathers only get 2 weeks
[15:42:26] andreastt: Ah, I see.
[15:42:27] AutomatedTester: but employers can add to it
[15:42:31] AutomatedTester: which mine does :)
[15:42:36] AutomatedTester: I get 4 weeks :)

[16:39:17] AutomatedTester: YAY! I conquered my email
[16:40:30] itatitat: ok
[16:40:33] itatitat: lukeis: thanks
[16:41:32] itatitat: and its necessary to install the addon?, becuase i'm going to design all my tests in local, with the addon, but later to run them is necessary as well?

[16:49:20] lukeis: itatitat: you're recording with IDE and then exporting that to be re-run? then no, you won't need the addon installed, but you will need to use the standalone-server.jar
[16:49:46] simonstewart: Who has the release bacon this time round?
[16:49:46] itatitat: aaaaaaaaaah, ok, thanks a lot, very helpful

[18:01:25] manoj: the reason for having it as a new patch is because of using the edit this page option.
[18:01:47] lukeis: yeah, but if you have the source locally cloned, just edit that :)

[18:02:32] lukeis: what about it?

[18:15:04] KaibutsuX: I want to see that "local" is derived from "remote"
[18:15:19] lukeis: manoj: there's a bug apparently with google code, when you forked it took you to a 404 page, but it did create a fork.
[18:15:33] manoj: Oh.. yeah i reported its a 404.
[18:15:39] manoj: hurray… found a bug :)

[19:16:34] barancev: deps.js go away!
[19:16:35] plightbo_work: i can try
[19:17:16] davehunt: plightbo_work: I'm setting a header for basic authentication, but it's of course set for all requests.. the site I'm loading loads external resources, and those are having an issue with the added header
[19:17:27] davehunt: can I make headers domain specific?

[19:18:29] davehunt: adamgoucher: that's what I thought.. going to need to rethink this then :/
[19:18:59] *adamgoucher should note however that /is/ java, so he might be wrong.
[19:19:42] *davehunt is using browsermob-proxy-py

[19:33:25] plightbo_work: davehunt: interesting. I know in the BrowserMob product you could do it by hosts. But if not in BMP then just open a feature request and I can hammer it out quickly
[19:33:34] plightbo_work: you can also hack it by doing a request interceptor for now
[19:33:43] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[19:33:50] plightbo_work: in the most recent source, there is a REST API for defining request interceptors
[19:33:56] davehunt: plightbo_work: thanks, I'll raise it
[19:33:59] jimevans: barancev: as far as i know we're not waiting on anything to release. IE and .NET are ready to go at a moment's notice (pending file versioning changes)
[19:34:10] plightbo_work: you just do a POST to /proxy/:port/interceptors/request and the body is JavaScript
[19:34:16] davehunt: plightbo_work: against the webmetrics fork?
[19:34:23] plightbo_work: yeah
[19:34:23] barancev: afaik Java binding is ready
[19:35:21] plightbo_work: the body is simple JavaScript that has a variable "req" of type BrowserMobHttpRequest
[19:36:16] davehunt: plightbo_work: ah, cool.. actually it looks like autoBasicAuthorization might be what I need
[19:36:30] plightbo_work: so you could do req.getMethod().addHeader(..., ...) or something like that
[19:36:36] davehunt: I haven't seen that in the python client
[19:36:51] plightbo_work: oh yeah
[19:36:52] plightbo_work: duh
[19:37:00] plightbo_work: I thoguht you were saying it didn't support hosts, but it does
[19:37:06] plightbo_work: so what's the issue?

[19:48:22] simonstewart: I was kind of expecting it to happen the day after Firefox 19 went live :)
[19:49:00] jimevans: simonstewart: would've liked that, but we didn't have updated linux native events binaries. :)
[19:49:16] simonstewart: Right. And that's why we pushed 2.30 when we did
[19:49:42] jimevans: well, let's do this, then.
[19:50:24] plightbo_work: davehunt: it's possible we hadn't exposed that one. Not all APIs are opened up. Open a ticket or set up a patch :) Seems like this is what you'd want:
[19:50:36] plightbo_work: POST /proxy/:port/auth/basic
[19:50:54] plightbo_work: which a JSON payload of {host: "...", username: "...", password: "..."}
[19:51:20] plightbo_work: or maybe better is POST /proxy/:port/auth/basic/:host and payload of {username, password}

[20:08:37] jimevans: totic1: the regular IE driver will work for IE10 on windows 8.
[20:08:46] totic1: but where do I put it?
[20:08:54] totic1: I dont see a windows/system32 folder
[20:09:03] lukeis: echo %PATH%
[20:09:17] jimevans: totic1: any folder that's in the system's PATH environment variable will work.
[20:09:41] totic1: so c:/windows/ should work?
[20:10:07] jimevans: totic1: i don't know is that directory part of the PATH environment variable?

[20:39:13] nirvdrum: jimevans: Am I going crazy, or does starting up 64-bit IE 10 on Win 7 actually run some weird 64-bit wrapper with a 32-bit process?
[20:39:54] KaibutsuX: ha
[20:40:06] jimevans: java, .net, and IE driver 2.31 are building.
[20:40:38] jimevans: nirvdrum: i have no idea
[20:40:44] AutomatedTester: dude-x: intchanter-work: where did you guys get with py3?
[20:40:58] dude-x: i haven't worked on it much lately. 
[20:41:05] nirvdrum: jimevans: I take it you haven't seen that then?  I'm looking at the task manager when I start up with 64-bit IEDriverServer.
[20:41:16] dude-x: running just the basic tests seems to error out in my environment
[20:41:30] jimevans: nirvdrum: not that i haven't seen it, i haven't paid any attention to it.
[20:41:36] dude-x: and the original python tests; one of the tests freeze
[20:42:00] jimevans: i know iexplore.exe gets launched at least twice for a single browser session.
[20:42:09] jimevans: but that's been the case since IE8
[20:42:30] *Osleg starting to get mad >___<
[20:42:58] nirvdrum: jimevans: Maybe IEDriverServer is at "fault" then?  I need to play around some more.
[20:42:59] jimevans: so maybe the broker process is now always 64-bit.
[20:43:02] davehunt has joined #selenium
[20:43:26] nirvdrum: I had to run with my 32-bit ActiveX thing for it to load up.
[20:43:37] jimevans: Osleg: sorry, i'm in the middle of about 7 other things, so i can't investigate your IE issue right now.
[20:44:23] Osleg: may you give an idea where could i possibly look to investigate/find sollution?
[20:44:24] nirvdrum: jimevans: However, IE 10 on Win 8 64-bit does not seem to do the same thing.
[20:44:29] dude-x: AutomatedTester: i haven't done too much work. I spend a lot of time with my gf; but last time i looked at the latest work done, running the tests for the original branch had one test that would lock up
[20:44:43] AutomatedTester: ok cool
[20:45:05] jimevans: Osleg: i know this will come across as rude, but i really don't have anything to offer.
[20:45:13] Osleg: meh
[20:45:18] Osleg: well thank you anyway
[20:45:31] dude-x: AutomatedTester: last fall, i had things in a pretty decent state and i was able to test it with more browsers. but since the switch to git and a new official repo, i don't know what to do with my codebase….
[20:45:57] dude-x: it would be cool if i can switch source repos on git and it would work automagically
[20:47:34] KaibutsuX: how do I disable nativeEvents on an IEDriver?
[20:47:34] jimevans: nirvdrum: what are you seeing on windows 8?
[20:47:59] jimevans: KaibutsuX: set the "nativeEvents" capability to false.
[20:48:17] nirvdrum: jimevans: On Win 8 64-bit, it's 64-bit all the way through.
[20:48:25] AutomatedTester: dude-x: I dont see why you cant
[20:48:32] nirvdrum: On Win 7 64-bit, I end up with one 64-bit iexplore and one 32-bit.
[20:48:38] KaibutsuX: jimevans: that is after starting the driver, correct?
[20:49:04] jimevans: KaibutsuX: i don't understand the question.
[20:49:13] dude-x: AutomatedTester: if i forked off k rosenveld's mirror, how do I set upstream to use the official mirror?
[20:49:20] KaibutsuX: I have to update AFTER instantiating the driver, NOT before like firefoxprofile
[20:49:27] dude-x: or even better.
[20:49:31] nirvdrum: I have no idea what's going on there.  If I go pure 32-bit, screenshots don't work.  If I do 64-bit, I get this weird hybrid.  Screenshots work, but only 32-bit plugins load.
[20:49:45] nirvdrum: So, I have no idea what's actually running there :-P
[20:49:56] dude-x: do i fork the official repo, then just create new branches locally and then apply my patches?

I've tried Object val13335 = js1.executeScript("if (typeof initted1 != 'undefined') { alert('defined'); } else { alert('undefined') }"); and it says undefined
[20:51:20] jimevans: KaibutsuX: depending on the language you're using, there should be a constructor overload that takes an options or capabilities instance, and that's where you set it - in the capabilities you pass to the constructor
[20:51:53] KaibutsuX: jimevans: ah, I don't believe python offers that
[20:52:08] nirvdrum: jimevans: Sorry, don't mean to bug you in the middle of a release.  We can chat more later.  I'll try to get more info.
[20:53:35] garndt: KaibutsuX: the constructor for the firefox driver takes a capabilities argument in python http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/webdriver.py#35
[20:54:26] KaibutsuX: garndt: IE
[20:54:34] Osleg: dude-x: git push --set-upstream <new mirror>
[20:55:01] lukeis: AutomatedTester: yes, i'll take care of it :)
[20:55:11] garndt: KaibutsuX: sorry, saw "firefox" and "python" and jumped the gun
[20:55:29] KaibutsuX: garndt: I think firefoxProfile is the preferred method for firefox anyway
[20:55:44] dude-x: Osleg:  thanks… :)
[20:55:54] Osleg: np :)
[20:56:11] lukeis: KaibutsuX: since it's python and the objects are in memory, you can directly update the webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.IE  object ;)
[20:56:25] jimevans: nirvdrum: so IE requires what's called a "broker process" that handles the communication between processes of different mandatory integrity levels. in IE7, this was easy to identify because the broker process was called IEUser.exe, and iexplore.exe was the browser process.
[20:56:46] lukeis: KaibutsuX: err DesiredCapabilities.INTERNETEXPLORER
[20:57:14] jimevans: in IE8, the broker process piece was subsumed into iexplore.exe. so since IE8, you've always gotten two iexplore.exe instances for the first IE browser window displayed.
[20:57:38] jimevans: now, it's possible that with IE10, they've changed that broker process piece so that it's always 64-bit on 64-bit windows.
[20:57:44] jimevans: i honestly don't know.
[20:58:07] intchanter-work: dude-x: Which test is hanging for you on the latest?
[20:58:30] dude-x: intchanter-work: two weeks ago it was api test
[20:58:32] intchanter-work: I'm merging the current changes from master as we speak.
[20:58:48] nirvdrum: jimevans: Well, unless I'm crazy I'd expect the broker to match the platform of the IE process proper.
[20:58:52] intchanter-work: That should be fixed.  It was erroring trying to shut down the webserver.

[21:00:31] intchanter-work: AutomatedTester: If you'd like to give it a spin and give any feedback, that would be welcome.  I understand if you're still busy with the mini-AT.  You can find it here: https://github.com/intchanter/selenium/tree/py23
[21:00:38] jimevans: nirvdrum: not necessarily. depends on how they implemented the interprocess communication.
[21:00:45] kentor: ok let me try that
[21:01:30] nirvdrum: jimevans: Okay, so Win 7 64-bit - IE 9, both processes are 64-bit.  Win 8 64-bit - IE 10, both processes are 64 bit.  Win 7 64-bit - IE 10, one is 32-bit, one is 64-bit.  (I'm using the 64-bit IEDriverServer)
[21:01:31] AutomatedTester: intchanter-work: did you update crazyfun or are you using tox?
[21:01:52] phishy has joined #selenium
[21:02:00] intchanter-work: Neither yet.  It has the .py changes necessary to support 2.6+ and 3.1+ though.
[21:02:04] nirvdrum: jimevans: So, it looks like this may be a quirk of IE 10 on Win 7.
[21:02:49] AutomatedTester: intchanter-work: ok cool
[21:03:27] intchanter-work: We still have tests failing, but they're a subset of the tests that fail without the changes.
[21:04:25] nirvdrum: jimevans: Normally I wouldn't care.  But this seems to be exhibiting some odd behavior.
[21:04:57] nirvdrum: I may be an isolated case.  If that's so, that's fine.  I just want to be sure it doesn't negatively impact others.
[21:05:49] lukeis: jimevans: so, 2.31 is tagged right? I can release python?
[21:06:10] barancev: yes, tagged
[21:06:12] jimevans: lukeis: yes, it's tagged
