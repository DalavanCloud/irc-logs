[05:25:46] barancev: nirvdrum: GET request support was fixed because of this issue, I don't know which client is used by this person, but according to the specification RC protocol must support GET requests, and I've fixed this
[05:26:19] nirvdrum: Assuming the specification wiki page is accurate :-P
[05:26:54] nirvdrum: I guess we don't have anything else to go by though.
[05:28:17] barancev: yes, this one is the only specification I've found
