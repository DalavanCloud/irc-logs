[06:09:28] dogarrhea: cool
[06:09:51] dogarrhea: firefox hangs for 5 hours waiting for some request when I can clearly see a              driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(11, TimeUnit.SECONDS); line in my code
[06:10:01] dogarrhea: why can't selenium just not be buggy
[06:11:23] dogarrhea: if they can't promise cross platform/version support it's pretty much useless
[06:11:24] barancev: dogarrhea: do you have a reproduction scenario? which version of selenium and browser do you use?
[06:11:58] barancev: :log
[06:11:58] selbot2: http://illicitonion.com/selogs/selenium/2013/02/10.txt | http://illicitonion.com/selogs/search
[06:13:24] dogarrhea: this is going to take so much time to replicate.. it took 5 hours when i was afk and i see the red "webdriver" thing in the lower right and it's "waiting for blahblahblah site....."
[06:13:34] dogarrhea: but i am on 18.01
[06:13:40] dogarrhea: i've had stability issues with selenium forever.
[06:14:09] dogarrhea: it's fine though
[06:14:46] dogarrhea: whenever the stupid test hangs, i have a chron/task scheduler job that closes the browser, the test catches the error and goes back a few times and then skips the test if the problem keeps occuring
[06:14:51] dogarrhea: so stupid and hackey
[06:16:52] barancev: 18 is the browser version. which version of selenium do you use?
[06:17:05] dogarrhea: yep it happened again. 
[06:17:24] dogarrhea: it's stuck on "Transferring data from www.amicusrx.com..." 
[06:17:32] dogarrhea: not doing anythi9ng. it's more than 11 seconds now
[06:18:41] barancev: so it hangs in get? or click? when loading a new page, right?
[06:19:04] dogarrhea: i'm only getting
[06:19:37] dogarrhea: well, that's not true, i'm searching for //a
[06:19:50] dogarrhea: but usually when it's searching for links i can see the red webdriver blinking in the lower right hand corner
[06:21:15] dogarrhea: still transferring.
[06:22:26] barancev: if it is in get, try to use "unstable" page loading strategy, see the very last chapter in :wiki FirefoxDriver
[06:22:27] selbot2: 1: 03FirefoxDriver: Information about the Firefox Driver - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriver
[06:23:15] barancev: but 1) it was broken before 2.29, you need 2.29 to use unstable page loading strategy
[06:23:52] gabrielrotbart has joined #selenium
[06:24:46] barancev: hmm... I was going to write 2), but I see you use implicit waits, so just 1)
[06:34:35] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[06:39:15] dogarrhea: so basically it's a selenium bug
[06:39:30] dogarrhea: i don't see any stack trace or anything
[06:39:59] barancev: basically, the browser can't reach readyState = "complete" and selenium waits
[06:42:17] barancev: "unstable" page loading strategy allows selenium to act when readyState = "interactive" that means "the page is rendered and a user can interact with it, but some elements are still loading"
[06:42:48] dogarrhea: these are internals right?
[06:45:34] barancev: these are two different solutions of the :google halting problem
[06:45:35] selbot2: Halting problem - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem
[06:46:08] barancev: (applied to page loading)

[07:15:11] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[07:16:50] dogarrhea: it's not the halting problem :/
[07:17:12] dogarrhea: way to twist a bug out of proportion into an attempt to say it's an unsolvable problem
[07:17:33] dogarrhea: if i see a "Transferring from blah blah blah" for over 10 seconds
[07:17:36] dogarrhea: it should turn off
[07:17:41] dogarrhea: that's not the halting fucking problem
[07:17:47] dogarrhea: it's just a message.
[07:18:27] dogarrhea: you see a message for 10 seconds? turn off. done
[07:18:45] dogarrhea: we aren't writing code to monitor firefox code to see if it's done. 
[07:18:55] dogarrhea: "scan c++ for possible infinite loop"
[07:18:57] dogarrhea: no way
[07:23:37] dogarrhea: if selenium is trying to solve the halting problem then that tells me i shouldn't be using it anyways
[07:23:46] barancev: dogarrhea: why do you think your definition of "page loading complete" is right? most people don't want to halt, they want all resources to be loaded to the page, even if it takes more than 10 sec
[07:24:03] dogarrhea: whatever time it takes, that's when it should stop
[07:24:14] dogarrhea: and since i specified 11 seconds in my code and it's not stopping, it's a bug
[07:24:43] barancev: and you're free to not use selenium, I hope nobody oblige you to do so :)
[07:25:14] dogarrhea: but yea, halting problem and selenium are not even in the same league
[07:25:22] dogarrhea: you will get an F in your computing course.

[11:57:34] samphippen has joined #selenium
[11:59:42] bcave: hi all. we've been using selenium for a couple of years now, and have recently overhauled one of our UI's, implementing it with a whole new set of libraries that uses a lot of javascript. backbone, underscore, handlebars, etc. finding it hard to use selenium with the new UI
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Feb 11 12:00:56 2013]
[12:00:56] bcave: for example: go to log in page, enter credentials and submit. There is client-side validation that the fields are being completed, but the validators are failing. it seems like the js doesn't register selenium's "type" on the components, and when I try submit the login form, I get a message complainig (for example) that the username field needs to be completed.
[12:01:06] bcave: while I can see that the value has been entered
[12:01:22] simonstewart: lunch. biab
[12:01:51] bcave: is this something that others have come across? a common problem? I know that it could probably be resolved by looking into the validation, but thats all handled by MVC defaults of the libraries, and I don't really want to go fiddling around with that
[12:03:12] AutomatedTester: bcave: is this with WebDriver?
[12:04:28] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[12:08:33] Ardesco: if it's any help (which it may not be) what I'm working on now is using underscore and handlebars and we aren't seeing those issues
[12:08:52] Ardesco: this is using WebDriver API though

[12:19:07] detronizator: AutomatedTester: moaning?

[12:20:14] AutomatedTester: you said something about PhantomJS is a real browser to and I shouldnt think otherwise
[12:20:16] detronizator: I don't follow, sorry. Here this question is about clicking and on which instances we "wait" for possible page loads
[12:20:46] detronizator: AutomatedTester: come on, don't be a dick :) I'm serious here

[12:21:50] detronizator: like FF, Chrome and Opera
[12:21:52] detronizator: that's all

[13:21:02] simonstewart: The stuff on CSS transforms you looked at might well play into it

[13:36:35] barancev: it is invisible, on the first sight
[13:36:46] barancev: but a user can switch between links with TAB key
[13:36:56] barancev: and it can switch to the "invisible" link and at the moment it gets the focus it becames visible
[13:37:28] barancev: the browser automatically scrolls the content of overflow:hidden block to make the link visible
[13:37:40] barancev: it is even possible to click it with the mouse after this
[13:38:21] AutomatedTester: barancev: got a test page showing that?
[13:38:26] barancev: sure

[13:50:43] barancev: in Opera I can't navigate with the keyboard, is it ever possible?
[13:51:51] barancev: IE shows the hidden link, but you need more that two TAB clicks, because it starts from the addressbar, not from the first link on the current page
[13:52:13] AutomatedTester: barancev: I cant get that to happen for me
[13:52:14] barancev: four TABs (addressbar, search, first link, second link)
[13:52:53] barancev: can you switch to the first link? what happens when you click TAB again?

[IRC logfile - Started Mon Feb 11 14:00:26 2013]
[14:00:26] barancev: Opera does not scroll, when a "hidden" link gets the focus it is hidden, but if I press Enter it becomes visible and the browser follows the link
[14:00:35] barancev: so it's kinda clikc
[14:00:39] barancev: so it's kinda click
[14:00:58] barancev: verdict: all the browser allow a user to navigate this "hidden" link

[14:07:45] barancev: "It seems a bit strange, but if I create a new user profile in Firefox 3, keyboard navigation works without further configuration. If I create a new Mac OS X user, however, keyboard navigation does not work until I add accessibility.tabfocus in about.config."

[17:17:22] dude-x: intchanter-work: yeah
[17:17:30] nirvdrum: I think the second one would fail anyway, since it wouldn't be able to bind to the port.
[17:17:32] dukeatcoding: which is stupid atm ;) and startsup every time
[17:17:45] dukeatcoding: another thing i am looking for right now are 
[17:17:49] dukeatcoding: hub control commands like
[17:17:55] dukeatcoding: ?cmd=shutDownSeleniumServer
[17:17:58] dukeatcoding: is there a list somewhere
[17:18:02] dukeatcoding: didn't found one so far
[17:18:21] nirvdrum: Turning this into an upstart script wouldn't be too hard.  But I don't think that would prevent multiple instances either.  It just would give you a standard tool for starting up.
[17:18:49] nirvdrum: That isn't really a hub command.  That's an RC server command that the hub also responds to.
[17:18:59] dukeatcoding: the thing is i probably will run multiple instance in the future
[17:19:00] nirvdrum: I have no idea what else is available.
[17:19:01] dukeatcoding: on different ports
[17:19:05] nirvdrum: Why?
[17:19:08] dukeatcoding: so only scanning for selenium hub processes
[17:19:11] dukeatcoding: wont do it
[17:19:29] dukeatcoding: I want to have seperate grids with dedicated machines and special configs
[17:20:04] nirvdrum: You could just segregate a single grid with different capabilities.
[17:20:40] dukeatcoding: but i want to ensure that Person A doesn't run test on the machine Person B does
[17:21:01] dukeatcoding: I have build a system which can boot machines with about 1200 configurations
[17:21:21] nirvdrum: Well, have fun with that :-P
[17:21:22] dukeatcoding: and i created a java class to boot a specific grid
[17:21:26] dukeatcoding: configuration on demand
[17:21:33] dukeatcoding: works fine ;)
[17:21:46] Phil37: ye well i can eat a whole steak without pooping
[17:21:47] dukeatcoding: when i put a rotating port for the hub
[17:21:49] dukeatcoding: its no problem

[17:22:01] dukeatcoding: ;)
[17:22:02] dukeatcoding: lol
[17:22:05] Phil37: i know.
[17:22:16] dukeatcoding: so there must be a list of server commands anywhere
[17:22:20] dukeatcoding: or do i have to dig into the code
[17:22:34] nirvdrum: dukeatcoding: I don't doubt it would work.  That's just an awful lot of infrastructure to manage.

[17:57:51] jimevans: but i'm off to grab lunch. brb.
[17:58:26] RossPatterson: We're both right.  It depends on which element Mike Hill wants to act on.  Your XPath identifies the <SPAN>, mine the <BUTTON>.  Knowing JavaScript frameworks, he might really want a <DIV> six miles away from both of those :-(

[20:52:25] jarib: jimevans: 60 seconds in ruby 
[20:53:04] jimevans: so in the case that an http command doesn't respond, the ruby bindings could take up to 3 minutes to throw an error?
[20:53:07] jarib: that's the default for the HTTP client in ruby's stdlib
[20:53:40] jimevans: (i'm looking in the ruby bindings' implementation of an http request to a wire protocol remote server)
[20:53:46] jarib: 3 minutes? 
[20:54:00] jarib: the connection will time out after 60 seconds
[20:54:23] jimevans: there appears to be retry logic in the request method of Selenium::WebDriver::Remote::Http::Default
[20:55:37] jarib: oh right. but that's only for those socket errors, not for the TimeoutError you'd get after 60 seconds

[23:35:47] Guest30455: hi everyone! wondering if anyone has run into this problem: I have jenkins setup with the selenium grid plugin and i have a mac/chrome and mac/firefox node registered to it. my simple test just starts the remote browser, does a get, and then closes the browser. when i start up a chrome browser, things work. when i start up a firefox browser, the firefox browser opens but the url never shows up in the address bar and it eventually times out
