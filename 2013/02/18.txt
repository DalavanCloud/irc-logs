[09:55:12] millenium: who can give me a hint about using nunit +.net + webdriver - ignore specific tests with specific TestFixture parameters (in TestFixture I set the driver type - FF, IE, Ch, Safari, etc.)
[09:56:41] Manoj_: millenium: I havent used much on Nunit with .net
[09:56:58] Manoj_: however, I may give a try. Let me know what are you trying to achieve
[09:57:02] rananda has joined #selenium
[09:57:33] millenium: I have one idea but search for better one, I add categories - "not supported from FF", "not supported from IE" .. then in each test I have method checking what category it is and what driver is at this time userd and if they match igore the test
[09:58:10] millenium: in TestFixture i have  [TestFixture(typeof(FirefoxDriver))] [TestFixture(typeof(ChromeDriver))] etc...

[10:13:16] millenium: no, I create successfully my webdriver objects and I don't need to do nothing in [SetUp]
[10:14:16] millenium: here is the problem I have list of tests, SOME of them fail on SOME browsers, on my test case [TestFixture] I set up my browsers and each test is run on each browser
[10:14:57] millenium: the problem is how to check and ignore some tests in some browsers when those tests are loaded, or maybe I can ignore them before that
[10:15:58] millenium: with categories I can ignore some tests, but for all browsers, on TestFixture I can ignore some browsers but for all tests - I'm looking for something in the middle
[10:16:42] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[10:18:51] millenium: I found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11017830/getting-nunit-selected-categories-programatically and now I think to made a method CheckDriverCompatibility(); where to get category and the type of the correct browser and ignore if they match
[10:19:34] millenium: but it will be just like             if (Driver.GetType() == typeof (ChromeDriver)                 || Driver.GetType() == typeof (InternetExplorerDriver))                 Assert.Ignore("This test is not supported by ChromeDriver and InternetExplorerDriver.");

[11:47:47] millenium: Ardesco it will be great to make all tests to pass but it take some times too muck time, project is big, I make tests myself and it's vary java scrip heavy project. Kendo UI, jQuery UI, jscroller etc.
[11:53:10] samphippen has joined #selenium
[11:55:10] Ardesco: more time to make the tests pass than to hack in a way to ignore specific tests?

[15:19:18] jimevans: have i mentioned how much i hate *sigh* nuget recently?
[15:19:23] acidjnk: when I run a couple of steps in selenium IDE using firefox, it fries all other Javascript on the page so that I can't use the page afterwards anymore for manual input. Is there any way to prevent that?
[15:19:52] jimevans: must. resist. snarky. response.
[15:19:58] Ardesco: I couldn't

[15:20:20] Ardesco: ah to that
[15:20:42] Ardesco: acidjnk are you sure it's IDE causing problems and not just bad JS
[15:20:59] jimevans: acidjnk: apologies. i'm willfully ignorant of selenium IDE, so i'm not going to be much help.

[15:21:51] acidjnk: no, not at all. it's always bad script, otherwise i wouldn't have to fix errors in it. But in all selenium IDE versions since 2007 I had this problem. I run a few steps in the IDE, for example to help me fill out 20 or 30 form fields, and then want to continue manually. And at that point, all other javascript doesn't work anymore.
[15:22:08] acidjnk: the only thing that helps is to close selenium IDE. then it works again immediately, without reloading the page or anything.

[16:09:32] duktatcoding: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver
[16:09:35] intchanter: Testing that now.
[16:09:42] duktatcoding: is it standalone replacement for the normal selenium node ?
[16:09:45] duktatcoding: or do i have to use both
[16:09:51] duktatcoding: the selenium.jar + the chrome driver
[16:11:08] smccarthy: duktatcoding: what I do is keep the selenium-standalone jar on my node, plus the ChromeDriver for that specific OS. Than when I start the node, I use -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=path/to/chrome/driver in the command line
[16:11:21] smccarthy: same with the IE driver
[16:11:25] duktatcoding: ah cool
[16:11:30] duktatcoding: so the Chrome driver will be loaded
[16:11:34] duktatcoding: as part of the normal node ?
[16:11:38] smccarthy: yea
[16:11:57] smccarthy: since u cant set the webdriver.chrome.driver property from your code. Needs to be set on each node u want to use chrome
[16:12:29] duktatcoding: ok thats no problem , i have an installation routine already for the selenium-standalone.jar
[16:12:34] duktatcoding: i would include the chrome driver then

[16:18:38] duktatcoding: i simply store the standalone exe

[16:53:06] intchanter: Dude-X_: The webserver thread loops, serving requests as long as self.stop_serving is False.  The main thread sets it to True and then sends another request, wrapped in a try.  I unwrapped it to see if I could get the real error.
[16:53:20] intchanter: except Exception: isn't terribly descriptive.
[16:53:58] Dude-X_: maybe the web server code needs to tweaked bit for python3
[16:54:08] intchanter: Oddly, if we don't catch the exception, the test case finishes without killing the webserver at all, and it continues serving additional requests.
[16:54:15] intchanter: Probably.
[16:54:30] intchanter: I'm looking over the test log for any clues.
[16:54:41] Dude-X_: are tests passing?
[16:55:01] intchanter: Most, yes.  It's not quite as good as the results I get on the original code yet though.

[17:25:35] zac_sel_ has joined #selenium
[17:27:00] jimevans: regex__: because you're depending on passing in an id to the InnerText or GetInnerText method. i would expect that you already have the div you're looking for, because you pass it into the constructor.
[17:27:35] jimevans: in which case, your InnerText property would simply return this.objectName.Text.
[17:28:42] jimevans: if your Div class doesn't actually represent the <div> element that you're passing into the constructor, then your object model doesn't make sense to me.
[17:29:57] regex__: jimevans: Okay.  So make an interface of Divs and pass that into the constructor?
[17:30:06] jimevans: um. no.

[17:32:02] jimevans: (as opposed to some *other* element that you haven't told me about)
[17:32:08] regex__: Yes and no.  It would require the developer to pass in the Div and understand it needs the Div to be passed in? 
[17:32:54] regex__: jimevans: All I want to do is be able to use a property access that InnerText method...
[17:34:00] phishy has joined #selenium
[17:34:05] jimevans: regex__: i can give you an answer, but i want to make sure it's the *right* answer given what you're trying to accomplish.
[17:34:36] regex__: I don't have any other extension method for Div. 
[17:35:05] jimevans: i guess what I'm getting at is that i don't understand the purpose of a FindElement call, if you already *have* the element you're interested in (as would be implied by the constructor)
[17:35:31] jimevans: i don't think anyone mentioned "extension methods".
[17:36:47] regex__: jimevans: You're right.  This whole thing was just for me to learn Selenium and become a better developer.
[17:36:54] samphippen has joined #selenium
[17:37:21] regex__: I wanted to be able to organize a Div class to put methods specific to Div.  I realize the InnerText call is generic to all IWebElements.
[17:37:29] jimevans: i mean, if it were me, i'd do this: https://gist.github.com/jimevans/4979115
[17:38:46] jimevans: (and you're right, that property would probably be better served on a base class, since it's common to other elements than <div> elements)
[17:39:08] regex__: jimevans: Should I do that with all of my methods:  https://gist.github.com/brockf12/4979142
[17:40:47] jimevans: regex__: my rule of thumb is that if i have a method that takes no arguments, and returns a value, that's a pretty good candidate to be turned into a property.
[17:42:09] jimevans: if you're asking for a code review, i can give you one.
[17:42:41] jimevans: but i'm only going to do it on one class at a time.
[17:42:54] jimevans: i can't look at the framework as a whole; i'm sure i'd miss something.
[17:43:22] regex__: Absolutely.  That's why I'm only doing a little bit everyday.
[17:43:38] regex__: jimevans: I just steal 10 minutes of your time everyday.
[17:44:36] jimevans: for instance: your Textfield class, your GetTextfield method and set_Textfield method should be a read-write property, and its name probably shouldn't be Textfield, since it's returning the raw webdriver element. 
[17:45:05] jimevans: i don't see any purpose in having a RowCount, ColumnCount, or GetCell method on a Textfield.
[17:45:46] jimevans: unless your Textfield class isn't modeling a simple text field (i.e., <input> element). then, if that's not the case, you should either (a) document the hell out of it, or (b) call it something different.
[17:46:41] regex__: jimevans: That's supposed to be table
[17:46:54] jimevans: then it makes much more sense. :)
[17:47:46] regex__: jimevans: https://gist.github.com/brockf12/4979223
[17:48:48] jimevans: regex__: i'd be willing to bet that code doesn't compile
[17:50:26] intchanter: Dude-X_: webserver.py is now working.  I'm starting to look at the individual test cases that failed.
[17:51:02] jimevans: regex__: at the very least, line 26 in the gist is problematic 
[17:52:16] jimevans: regex__: furthermore, i don't understand why GetRowCount() and ColumnCount() take an argument.
[17:53:30] samphippen has joined #selenium
[17:54:01] regex__: jimevans: You're sharp.  Yes, line 26 was just refactoring crap.  I realize a git can't return a method.

[18:54:14] Gx4: hi
[18:55:02] Gx4: I have a question if I try to do Select select = new Select(element); it does not recognize Select class nor does it offer to import it
[18:55:41] intchanter: Gx4: Which bindings are you using?
[18:56:17] Gx4: I'm using webdriver in c# code
[18:56:32] jimevans: Gx4: you want SelectElement. and you need a reference to WebDriver.Support.dll
[18:57:24] jimevans: ("select" is a keyword in LINQ, so it's not a good candidate for the name of a class)
[18:57:49] Gx4: ah ok forgot that :D
[18:59:14] *jimevans is coming to regret that he ever implemented anything in the support library for the .NET bindings
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Feb 18 19:00:03 2013]
[19:00:03] intchanter: jimevans: Why's that?  Stuck maintaining and supporting them?
[19:01:25] jimevans: intchanter: sort of. what i'm really regretting is ever supporting the *sigh* nuget packaging system.
[19:02:00] intchanter: It that pronounced "nougat", "nugget", or both?
[19:02:01] jimevans: but there's no specification that says "this should be in the support libs" or "this shouldn't be". 
[19:02:21] jimevans: i've only ever heard it pronounce "new-get"
[19:03:13] Gx4: we use it to exchange contracts between services
[19:05:32] jimevans: the major issue with *sigh* nuget (and all library packaging systems, really) is that you either are a project that uses it, or you're not. if you're a project that uses it, you need to expect all of your consumers to use it too. webdriver has users in both camps, so it can't really force people to use the packaging system.
[19:07:23] intchanter: Ew, so it's a virus?
[19:07:44] jimevans: and if you'll notice, with me, it's always "*sigh* nuget". mostly because those who use the packaging system can be foamy-mouthed, swivel-eyed zealots about it, and really pushy if you don't subscribe to its model.
[19:07:56] jimevans: and its model is deficient in two major ways.
[19:09:06] jimevans: strongly-named assemblies (often mischaracterized as "signed" assemblies) and in projects that don't necessarily update their dependencies at the exact moment a new release of a dependency is available.
[19:09:11] intchanter: I wish I could offer more, but you have my sympathy.

[19:09:51] jimevans: webdriver, for what it's worth, hits both deficiencies.

[19:42:20] jimevans: nirvdrum: yikes, i dunno. what's the error?
[19:42:51] nirvdrum: "Selenium::WebDriver::Error::ElementNotVisibleError: Received a JavaScript error attempting to click on the element using synthetic events. We are assuming this is because the element isn't displayed, but it may be due to other problems with executing JavaScript. (WARNING: The server did not provide any stacktrace information)"
[19:43:02] nirvdrum: I've verified that the element is in fact displayed.
[19:43:28] nirvdrum: The HTML is a bit crappy though.  It's a <button> with a type of "submit" (used for form submission apparently).
[19:44:54] nirvdrum: I can distill down to a test case, but figured I'd try to debug a bit more first.
[19:53:56] jimevans: okay so the question is, what does element.displayed? return. if it returns true, then there's something else going on, and we'll probably need to debug it further.

[20:00:54] nirvdrum: jimevans: I guess it's coming back as false.  Odd.
[20:00:59] nirvdrum: Does that come from atoms?
[20:02:23] jimevans: nirvdrum: yes, is-displayed is pretty much a direct atoms call.
[20:03:25] nirvdrum: Okay.  Thanks.
[20:04:55] nirvdrum: Methinks there's a bug in there.
[20:05:27] nirvdrum: I've had to deal with some convoluted definitions of "is visible" and so far this seems to pass all of the criteria.

[20:16:16] nirvdrum: jimevans: Sorry to bother you again.  But there a way to executeScript with the bot handle in scope?
[20:17:15] jimevans: nirvdrum: how do you mean "with the bot handle in scope"?
[20:17:26] nirvdrum: I.e., to debug this I'd like to be able to execute arbitrary JS, but with atoms code loaded.
[20:17:42] nirvdrum: E.g., so I can execute bot.dom.getEffectiveStyle(e, 'display')
[20:21:00] jimevans: nirvdrum: i've had remarkably bad luck getting the atoms code loaded outside the scope of the atoms tests themselves.
[20:21:19] nirvdrum: Ugh.  That's going to make debugging considerably harder.
[20:21:33] jimevans: maybe one of the google guys has a tried-and-true method of doing it, but i haven't ever been able to get it working reliably.
[20:21:51] nirvdrum: Well, thanks for trying :-)
[20:22:41] jimevans: alternatively, if you can create a simple repro case, you can drop an html file into trunk/javascript/atoms/test and run it as if it were an atoms test.
[20:22:58] nirvdrum: jleyba: Is there a sensible way to remotely execute JS with the atoms loaded?  I'm trying to track down a potential issue with isShown and it'd be a lot easier if I could executeScript or something similar with the bot reference loaded.
[20:23:06] jimevans: using 'go debug-server'
[20:23:34] jleyba: go debug-server will have the raw source
[20:23:45] nirvdrum: Well, reproducing would be a lot easier if I could narrow down what the failure case is.  As you've aptly pointed out, this method is a bit gnarly.
[20:24:51] barancev: jleyba: hi! do you know already that  f7fa29c99c7da33e994d0ed15eac064441902b4c broke almost all JS tests?

[21:10:13] jimevans: fwiw, i'm happy with IE at the moment.

[21:10:56] jimevans: shall i go ahead and bump the IE version number to 2.30?
[21:11:24] intchanter: Does the CI server have Python 3 installed in parallel with Python 2?
[21:11:24] simonstewart: Go for it
[21:11:34] intchanter: And is that where the release packages are built?
[21:11:41] simonstewart: Doubt it. Officially no-one tests with p3k
[21:11:53] simonstewart: release packages are built locally
[21:11:58] simonstewart: from a known git tag
[21:12:29] intchanter: Are you okay with Py3 changes being included without running tests on py3 then?
[21:12:46] intchanter: This looks like it's probably ready to go (a handful of tests remaining, but looking good).
[21:13:16] simonstewart: AutomatedTester knows more about the py bindings than me
[21:13:28] simonstewart: I'm ok with them, provided python 2.6 continues to work
[21:13:39] intchanter: The tests can be run with a manual change to mappings/python.rb at present.

[21:37:38] simonstewart: Awesomeness.
[21:37:45] simonstewart: So it's not a real problem?
[21:37:47] simonstewart: How irksome.
[21:38:06] barancev: yes, this test uses stubs, and they were broken
[21:38:18] simonstewart: *sigh*
[21:38:21] simonstewart: Thank you. Good catch

[21:41:39] barancev: this is a new test
[21:41:54] simonstewart: Yeah. Was wondering whether it'd been fixed yet :)
[21:41:55] barancev: it never passed before

[22:19:46] simonstewart: And then I think we're good to go
[22:20:02] simonstewart: barancev, jimevans, jleyba: Any reason not to push 2.30?
[22:20:16] jimevans: i'm ready, as far as i know.
[22:20:19] barancev: none I know about
[22:20:22] jleyba: all good here
[22:20:34] simonstewart: Great. If these tests pass, I'm going for it

[22:36:34] jleyba: is that tests for se 1.0?
[22:36:35] simonstewart: Running again.
[22:36:40] simonstewart: That and the WDBS
[22:37:04] simonstewart: looks like lots of 404 errors for the proxy-based rc tests
[22:37:09] simonstewart: So that should be easy enough to fix
[22:37:18] simonstewart: WDBS is a little more worrying
[22:37:32] jleyba: I've had my hands in WDBS… was green last time I ran the tests
[22:37:46] simonstewart: Using firefox 10
[22:38:02] jleyba: oh.. yeah, didn't run there
[22:38:06] jleyba: tried chrome and ff17
[22:38:21] simonstewart: ff10 is still supported
[22:38:40] barancev: we run WDBS tests on CI with FF17
[22:38:58] simonstewart: should also do 10:)

[22:47:48] jleyba: it was sporadic
[22:47:52] simonstewart: Just updated my java version on OS X, so seeing whether a clean build helps
[22:48:05] jleyba: i hit it on linux
[22:49:42] simonstewart: Wonder whether we need to bump the jruby version

[23:12:15] simonstewart: OK. Looks like something to do with jruby now bumping up to version 1.9
[23:13:13] jimevans: maybe time to update albacore?
[23:14:32] simonstewart: Well, this jruby update appears to update a fuck ton of stuff
[23:14:37] simonstewart: including albacore
[23:14:42] simonstewart: and rake
[23:15:52] simonstewart: Alright. It's getting late here. Upping Firefox to 17

[23:15:56] simonstewart: even

[23:41:05] jarib: new jruby version would be a massive improvement, especially on java 7
[23:41:47] simonstewart: It'd be worth doing the update. It's choking on albacore and the .net stuff for me
[23:41:53] simonstewart: I've hacked that out in my local copy
[23:42:10] simonstewart: But it's not particularly elegant
[23:42:17] simonstewart: And breaks .net :)
[23:42:26] jarib: heh
[23:42:33] jarib: are we bundling the latest albacore?
[23:42:48] simonstewart: Nope
[23:44:13] jarib: looks like there are fixes for 1.9 in trunk, but not released
[23:44:19] jarib: though should still be possible to run jruby in 1.8 mode
[23:44:26] jarib: (if that's what causing trouble)
[23:44:28] simonstewart: Pffft.
[23:44:33] simonstewart: I think it's a memory thing
[23:44:50] jarib: just add --1.8 in ./og
[23:44:52] simonstewart: We output a lot of stuff in the webdriver-backed selenium tests
[23:45:09] simonstewart: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
[23:45:14] jarib: ah
[23:45:19] simonstewart: How. Much. Memory. Do. We. Need?
[23:45:38] jarib: so you solved undefined method "csc" then.
[23:45:47] simonstewart: Nope. I just replaced it with "task"
[23:46:42] jarib: "fixes for 1.9 in trunk" - i meant albacore trunk
[23:47:09] simonstewart: That explains a few things

[23:50:48] simonstewart: Right. Fuck it
