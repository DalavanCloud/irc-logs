[00:47:29] garndt: anyone know if there is a way to have IE driver crash gracefully and not have it block the next test?  Windows prompts when IE driver has crashed and stopped responding and the next test does not being until that dialog is dismissed

[00:50:19] rpereira_ has joined #selenium
[00:56:52] zsawyer: garndt, is that like a popup dialog?
[00:57:20] dude-x: kentor: return jsVar != nil;
[00:57:29] dude-x: or is that null...
[00:57:34] dude-x: google it :p
[00:59:09] kentor: hrmmm, but that is a call from Java

[01:00:49] garndt: zsawyer: It's a native Windows dialog for when a process crashes.  
[01:01:04] zsawyer: ouch that sounds really bad
[01:03:39] sayd has joined #selenium
[01:03:55] zsawyer: garndt, are you interested in me suggesting dirty work-arounds?
[01:04:05] sayd: i'm trying to run -help from the jar but getting: xception in thread "main" java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError at org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncher.main(GridLauncher.java:44)
[01:08:58] sayd: did that message make it to the channel?
[01:08:58] admc has joined #selenium
[01:09:00] zsawyer: yes
[01:09:19] zsawyer: (2:08:25 AM) sayd: i'm trying to run -help ...
[01:09:25] sayd: yep thanks
[01:10:12] zsawyer: no idea but have you tried with --help or -version --version?
[01:10:41] sayd: zsawyer: yeah well it shows a bunch of info then bails out towards the end (im guessign where the grid info would be)
[01:10:52] sayd: maybe its because im only using server-standalone.jar
[01:11:02] zsawyer: it is possible that you are missing a dependency?
[01:11:48] sayd: zsawyer: yeah possible, not sure how to check
[01:11:49] zsawyer: are you trying to run the standalone in grid mode?
[01:11:53] sayd: zsawyer: yeah
[01:12:14] sayd: well im trying to see what the ghostdriver is all about. it wants to connect to a wd/hub on 8080
[01:13:27] zsawyer: "Use this if you want to use the Selenium RC or Remote WebDriver or use Grid 2 without needing any additional dependencies" sounds like you might want to file a bug report?
[01:14:12] brettporter has joined #selenium
[01:16:05] zsawyer: i believe this error means that in one of the static functions or blocks of that class an exception is thrown - if you are using wrong parameters an initializer exception is a bad way to tell the user... so i'd say it's a bug
[01:16:19] sayd: zsawyer: yeah im upgrading to 2.30 
[01:16:38] sayd: works

[03:13:22] intchanter: Should ./go --trace be hanging on "Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005"?  I'm guessing no.  What can be done about it?
[03:27:31] smccarthy has joined #selenium
[03:30:05] zsawyer: garndt: have a look at AutoHotkey or AutoIt its pretty simple scripting to scan for the window and have the script dismiss it instantly. But thats not a really neat "solution". 
[03:31:46] zsawyer: Rereading your last - i  guess that's what pywinauto does too. Since the window contains information about the process that died you could make the script fairly safe i believe. 
[03:32:03] zsawyer: The biggest issue is that this should never happen in the first place. xD
[03:32:27] zsawyer: Bug report it?
[03:38:40] sent_hil: garndt: i was hoping do something like this: driver.executeScript(//add event listener);
[03:39:18] sent_hil: garndt: this is a very ajax heavy app and i'm emitting a lot of events, so it makes sense to add another listener and use that, instead of waiting

[IRC logfile - Started Thu Feb 21 12:00:28 2013]
[12:00:28] barancev: it's bundled into selenium-java
[12:01:18] barancev: I see it inside selenium-server-2.30.0.jar too
[12:01:21] Phil37 has joined #selenium
[12:01:34] jimevans: Ardesco: if you're talking about the Safari extension, it's now bundled into the jar (and the .NET assembly for .NET), and is installed/uninstalled on-demand at runtime.
[12:01:50] Ardesco: ah so i need to do nothing then
[12:01:54] jimevans: indeed
[12:01:56] Ardesco: fair enough
[12:01:57] Ardesco: :)
[12:02:41] jimevans: screw you IT departments worldwide for forcing me to create a trial account at mcafee.
[12:02:58] Ardesco: s/mcaffe/norton/
[12:03:25] Ardesco: which is even worse IMHO
[12:04:30] jimevans: yeah, but i hear about UnhandledAlertExceptions from mcafee users.
[12:06:01] Ardesco: I'm just being facetious because norton bought mcafee and IMHO they have been going downhill ever since
[12:06:07] Phil37: moving a test fraework from using the firefoxdriver to chromedriver shouldn't present too many issues no?  i've tried moving to the IEDriver before and it was a tad bothersome
[12:06:40] jimevans: norton bought mcafee? did intel then buy norton?
[12:07:04] jimevans: Phil37: that's because the IE driver is a piece of shit.
[12:07:18] Phil37: lol
[12:07:25] Phil37: i didnt want to say it in those words
[12:07:37] barancev: IE driver atm passes more tests than Opera or Chrome
[12:07:51] Phil37: thats surprising
[12:08:13] jimevans: Phil37: but as the IE driver developer always says, "patches welcome"
[12:08:26] barancev: at least it's my impression of :ignores
[12:08:27] selbot2: http://ignores.ci.seleniumhq.org/
[12:08:33] Ardesco: Phil37: my experience is that you will need to add more explicit waits to get chrome working
[12:08:52] Phil37: alright, good to know
[12:08:56] Ardesco: and you will probably come across one or two chrome oddities
[12:09:58] Ardesco: one we have right now is that when running tests against chrome in sauce elements that require a hover to show the element and then a click to got to a link don't work, we have to do a senKeys(Keys.RETURN) instead
[12:10:03] Ardesco: it all works fine locally though
[12:10:16] Ardesco: and stepping through it does everything, the click just doesn't seem to register
[12:10:22] Ardesco: not sure what that's all about yet
[12:10:28] Phil37: hmm
[12:10:29] Ardesco: but it's only when running against sauce
[12:10:46] Ardesco: o_O
[12:11:06] Phil37: we can find out what driver we're currently using somehow cant we?  in case there needs to be driver specific code somwhere
[12:11:26] Phil37: like do this with FFDriver or this for Chrome
[12:12:35] Ardesco: ((RemoteWebDriver) driver).getCapabilities().getBrowserName()

[15:00:31] Ardesco: they aced me if the router was plugged into the wall
[15:00:55] Ardesco: and stupidly I said, "Well no it's plugged into a micro filter, and that is plugged into the wall"
[15:01:34] dude-x: i once called dell tech support and got someone who didn't make me go through the song and dance, and actually told me about a hidden bios trick
[15:01:36] Ardesco: (we need to use micro filters here to stop interference between the data and voice signals just in case you don't need to do that in your country of origin and have no idea what i'm talking about
[15:01:40] dude-x: it actually fixed the problem
[15:01:53] Ardesco: they told me that my problem was because I was using a mircofilter and told me to remove it
[15:01:54] dude-x: i wish i wrote down that bios trick....
[15:02:09] Ardesco: and refused to believe that in the UK we need to use mircofilters 
[15:02:10] dude-x: Ardesco: that sounds like bad advice
[15:02:13] Ardesco: and would not test my line
[15:02:17] Ardesco: (which was b0rked)

[15:23:05] jimevans: eranm: i am. s'up?
[15:23:19] eranm: Good! Doing alright?
[15:24:00] jimevans: meh. i'm a little peeved at stubborn IT departments who won't let their users configure their machines right now, but yeah, i'm good.
[15:24:06] jimevans: you feeling better?
[15:24:29] eranm: You know, it could be worse. Those IT departments could force their users to stay on IE6.
[15:24:46] jimevans: eranm: many do! :)
[15:24:46] eranm: I'm better, thanks. not with a fever anymore, anyway
[15:24:56] jimevans: good that.
[15:25:04] eranm: I was wondering: Are full-page screenshots expected to work with IE10?
[15:25:32] eranm: I've never tried taking a screenshot on IE10, on account of not having windows 8 anywhere
[15:26:06] jimevans: i doubt it. i don't have a windows 8 environment to test on, but screenshots are one of the things that dawagner noted as not working entirely correctly when we first started looking at IE10 compatibility.
[15:26:22] barancev: dawagner: hi! jenkins missed several commits, it is alive?
[15:26:58] jimevans: i suspect something got borked by MSFT in windows 8, screwing with the hack we use to get full-page screenshots.
[15:27:13] jimevans: but that's pure speculation on my part.
[15:27:33] barancev: where are pull-requests from MS people?
[15:27:54] jimevans: barancev: nonexistent as of yet. (which was my fear/prediction)
[15:28:40] jimevans: eranm: glad you're here. i've a question on the interactions lib.\
[15:29:11] jimevans: for firefox specifically
[15:29:16] eranm: I can try my best to answer
[15:31:34] jimevans: in interactions.h, you've #define'd BOOL_TYPE to be "boolean" for microsoft compilers. any reason not to define it as "bool
[15:31:35] jimevans: "?
[15:33:43] eranm: jimevans, I believe it's because 'boolean' was exported to a type that matches the gecko sdk, while 'bool' wasn't. If it compiles with 'bool', by all means, change it.
[15:34:03] jimevans: let's take a look.
[15:35:56] jimevans: seems to build incrementally. let me try a clean first.
[15:36:56] jimevans: eranm: also, would you mind updating the firefox native events prebuilts when you get a chance?
[15:37:02] jimevans: for FF19, i mean.
[15:38:48] eranm: jimevans, you may have to include stdbool.h 
[15:39:08] eranm: jimevans, I'll be happy to. It may take until tomorrow though
[15:39:10] jimevans: eranm: don't seem to. looks like it builds just fine for me on windows.
[15:42:42] eranm: then feel free to remove it

[19:40:35] barancev: the issue is dated Mar 4, 2011
[19:40:38] nirvdrum: It had to do with the IDispatch method changing the number of parameters.
[19:41:01] nirvdrum: barancev: Arguably the issue should be closed.  SnapsIE has its own issue tracker.

[20:13:32] jimevans: i am. s'up?
[20:13:56] garndt: I wanted to get your opinion on something.  Sometimes the ie driver will become unresponsive and windows will popup a dialog indicating that with a button to close the program.  However this still keeps the process around and the script just waits there forever.  So far I've been just manually killing the process and closing the browser window to get it to
[20:13:56] garndt: error out and continue onto the next test.  Any suggestions of handling that programmatically?
[20:14:24] garndt: Was just having a brain fart right now and wanted to see if you had an idea.
[20:14:55] garndt: It doesn't happen often, but when it does happen I would just like it to fail silently and continue on
[20:15:57] jimevans: garndt: i'd wager what's happening is that the IEDriverServer.exe is actually crashing. you're not going to silently fail and continue from that. the executable needs to be fixed.
[20:17:21] garndt: Oh ok, well good to know so I don't spend time trying to hack some solution together
[20:18:22] jimevans: reproducible test cases and/or patches are always welcome. :)
[20:18:29] garndt: yes yes, I know :)
[20:19:00] garndt: I'm trying to reproduce it.  my logs got blown away last time (whoops) so I'm trying to track it down.  like I said, it's not all the time when running this series of tests, so it's not the same failure point every time
[20:19:34] jimevans: and if you can't reproduce it reliably, there's no way on earth i'll be able to.
[20:20:27] garndt: You're a C++ hacker, IE master, and computer mind reader.  You have the qualifications to do it!

[21:48:38] santiycr: not surprised, though 
[21:48:49] santiycr: I'm sure some of the ninjas here can explain this in detail
[21:49:08] runnyspot: well i just hope concatenating the port works

[21:54:08] jimevans: runnyspot: for IE, try adding the cookie using the javascript console in the F12 developer tools. if you can't add it there, the IE driver will never be able to add it, full stop.
[21:54:36] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[21:55:09] runnyspot: i'll try that
[21:55:31] runnyspot: i think i'll also try logging in normally
[21:55:38] runnyspot: then dumping the cookie with the webdriver
[21:55:42] runnyspot: seeing if i can spot the diff
[21:59:36] barancev: a question about WebElement.submit() method:
[21:59:43] barancev: according to the javadoc it @throws NoSuchElementException If the given element is not within a form
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Feb 21 22:00:00 2013]
[22:00:00] barancev: actually FF and Chrome throw InvalidElementStateException
[22:00:19] barancev: what's more correct -- docs or implementation?
[22:00:54] barancev: context: IE does not throw any exception, and I wonder what to implement

[22:11:30] dude-x: i thought .submit was one day going to be deprecated… 
[22:12:54] barancev: unfortunately it was not
[22:13:25] barancev: :spec
[22:13:26] selbot2: http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html | http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/
[22:14:35] barancev: yes, the spec does not list it, cool!
[22:17:06] runnyspot: santiycr: i have a feeling it might be due to the fact that on IE 9/Windows 2008, 'Protected Mode' is enabled. haven't checked other OS/browser combos
[22:20:42] santiycr: hm, afaik protected mode doesn't do much
[22:20:45] santiycr: jimevans?
[22:21:07] jimevans: santiycr: no idea. sorry.
[22:21:13] runnyspot: ok, i'm going to keep experimenting to try and narrow it down
[22:21:45] jimevans: again, the litmus test is can you do it via javascript in the F12 developer tools. if you can there, and webdriver can't, then we have an issue.
[22:22:54] runnyspot: yeah i'm working through that currently

[22:24:58] barancev: hmm... protocol specification tell nothing on submit of an element that is not whithin any form
[22:29:50] sayd: is there a way to determine if a particular ajax call happened?
[22:30:16] runnyspot: jimevans: i was able set the cookie through the JS console
[22:30:53] jimevans: then we've got something strange happening. under the covers, the IE driver is doing document.cookie = "<cookie string>
[22:30:54] jimevans: "
[22:31:34] runnyspot: then i'll try removing the domain, etc from the cookie and setting the main key/val pair
[22:32:12] jimevans: you could try bumping up the log level of the IEDriverServer and see what the log tells you.
[22:34:23] jimevans: if you set the log level to at least WARN, we'll at least be able to tell what operation is failing in attempting to add the cookie.
[22:34:31] runnyspot: ok
[22:37:59] admc has joined #selenium
[22:38:05] runnyspot: sorry, but what do i set in desired_caps to up the log level?

[22:45:51] runnyspot: jimevans: is there any sample code or test that might add a cookie in IE that I could compare with?
[22:46:09] jimevans: runnyspot: how comfortable are you in java?
[22:46:44] runnyspot: rusty, but i am surrounded by java devs
[22:47:01] jimevans: http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/CookieImplementationTest.java
[22:47:41] jimevans: if you prefer c#: http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/dotnet/test/WebDriver.Common.Tests/CookieImplementationTest.cs
[22:48:31] jimevans: these are the tests from the actual integration suite for the webdriver project itself. the java ones are run on all browsers, including IE6-10.
[22:48:51] jimevans: (though they're failing on IE10 for an as-yet-unknown reason)
[22:53:04] runnyspot: yeah im gonna need the logs :)
[22:53:11] runnyspot: maybe i can dig up a windows machine

[23:18:13] lukeis: arcee123: have you read the docs? seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp   and sounds like you'll want to click the drop down element, wait (read chapter 4 of the docs) for the contents to appear, and then assert the options are what is to be expected?
[23:19:19] arcee123: yes...and if the term is in at least one of the drop downs....then it's a pass.
[23:19:24] arcee123: I have a large list of terms to check against.
[23:20:14] lukeis: that's wait Arrays.contains() is for :)
[23:20:24] lukeis: or you can write a for loop
