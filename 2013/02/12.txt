[10:02:58] Andrei_Khveras: Hi! I use WebDriver.
[10:05:03] Andrei_Khveras: The main idea is that I do browser.deleteAllCookies when I'm logged in user and then immediatelly navigate to that page again. And the problem is I still remain logged in. I thought cookies clean up cause a session breaking.

[11:49:06] Kraplax: i've found flash-selenium on gogole code. but i can't figure out how to use it within behat
[11:49:10] andreastt: Kraplax: Selenium doesn't cover Flash.  You should look at Flash-specific automation frameworks for that.
[11:50:21] Kraplax: andreastt: could you take a look at http://code.google.com/p/flash-selenium/ to maybe make any suggestion on that?
[11:50:44] Kraplax: it should be an extension for selenium
[11:51:12] Kraplax: but behat doesn't use selenium directly, but rather through Mink driver..

[11:54:13] detronizator_hom: Hi Drivers,
[11:54:33] detronizator_hom: I have just discovered another case of "every driver does whatever the fuck it wants"
[11:54:33] detronizator_hom: https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/issues/178
[11:54:50] detronizator_hom: this time, ChromeDriver != FireFox != GhostDriver
[11:57:14] AutomatedTester: detronizator_hom: looks like bugs
[11:57:27] AutomatedTester: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html#cookies
[11:58:01] AutomatedTester: FirefoxDriver bug to be more precise
[11:58:37] detronizator_hom: AutomatedTester: I don't see a section where you guys define
[11:58:46] detronizator_hom: what to do if a webdriver instance is open but haven't navigated yet
[11:58:50] detronizator_hom: is it there?
[11:59:09] AutomatedTester:  	invalid cookie domain - If the cookie's domain is not visible from the current page.
[11:59:12] AutomatedTester: search for that
[11:59:23] *AutomatedTester wishes he could scroll for you 
[11:59:41] detronizator_hom: AutomatedTester: I read all the section on Cookies. That is NOT what I mean.
[11:59:58] *detronizator_hom wishes AutomatedTester would pay a tiny bit more attention to what he says
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Feb 12 12:00:09 2013]
[12:00:09] AutomatedTester: so you ARENT on the page right?
[12:00:21] detronizator_hom: new FirefoxDriver();
[12:00:29] detronizator_hom: that's it: no ".get" yet
[12:00:32] detronizator_hom: the page is blank
[12:00:36] detronizator_hom: points at "about:blank"
[12:00:43] detronizator_hom: if interaction with cookies happens at that stage
[12:00:46] detronizator_hom: Chrome says "FU"
[12:00:51] AutomatedTester: so that means, and correct me if I am wrong, that you arent on that domain right?
[12:00:51] *Ardesco_H offers detronizator a relaxing shoulder rub
[12:00:56] detronizator_hom: Firefox says "wellcome" and sets a domain-less cookie
[12:01:20] AutomatedTester: if you arent on the domain " 	invalid cookie domain - If the cookie's domain is not visible from the current page."
[12:01:40] detronizator_hom: it's frased wrong then
[12:01:50] detronizator_hom: because I can have a cookie without domain
[12:01:56] detronizator_hom: new Cookie(name, value) for example
[12:02:03] detronizator_hom: and be on "about:blank"
[12:02:47] detronizator_hom: Firefox seems to percieve "about:blank" as domain ""
[12:03:03] AutomatedTester: 12:01 AutomatedTester: FirefoxDriver bug to be more precise
[12:03:19] detronizator_hom: AutomatedTester: yes, I agree you said that straight away
[12:03:28] detronizator_hom: I think though the specs should cover the corner case
[12:03:29] detronizator_hom: of
[12:03:42] detronizator_hom: a Session in which no URL has not been loaded yet
[12:03:47] detronizator_hom: and interaction with cookies happens
[12:04:02] detronizator_hom: of course, if a cookie with "banana.domain.com" is set, that is rejected
[12:04:07] detronizator_hom: and all Drivers DO DO that
[12:04:11] detronizator_hom: but 
[12:04:23] detronizator_hom: the scenario that is not well covered
[12:04:40] detronizator_hom: is what to do if a domainless-cookie is provided
[12:04:46] detronizator_hom: you see what I'm trying to say?
[12:04:51] detronizator_hom: AutomatedTester: ^
[12:05:43] AutomatedTester: tbh I see setting a cookie on foo.bar.com while on bar.com the same trying to set it on about:home
[12:06:55] AutomatedTester: and that is covered already
[12:06:59] detronizator_hom: ok. what about a cookie WITHOUT domain
[12:07:19] detronizator_hom: current drivers "fill" the domain if it's not provided
[12:07:32] AutomatedTester: yea, that part is missing
[12:07:34] detronizator_hom: assuming that a "domain less" cookie should be set to the current page domain
[12:07:47] detronizator_hom: but if no domain is in the page either... here you go.
[12:08:03] AutomatedTester: right but that wasnt what you were complaining about
[12:08:23] AutomatedTester: feel free to raise a bug against the spec
[12:08:23] detronizator_hom: well, I was originally reporting a driver behaviour mismatch
[12:08:31] AutomatedTester: yes and I agreed
[12:08:43] detronizator_hom: cool, where do I raise bugs against the specs?
[12:08:46] AutomatedTester: and then I was told I was wrong
[12:09:24] AutomatedTester: https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi?comment=&blocked=20860&short_desc=%5BWebDriver%20Spec%5D%3A%20&product=Browser%20Test%2FTools%20WG&component=WebDriver

[12:10:21] kaawee_ has joined #selenium
[12:10:30] AutomatedTester: arex\: you will have to probably create a plugin for your runner to do that
[12:10:43] AutomatedTester: arex\: are you using mbunit or nunit?
[12:11:04] arex\: AutomatedTester: MSTest, but I can easily change
[12:13:36] AutomatedTester: arex\: I know nunit supports creating extensions and addons
[12:13:45] AutomatedTester: have a look at them and see what you can get
[12:14:35] arex\: AutomatedTester: I'll do that. Thanks. Seems like a useful thing, so I expect there to be some existing solutions somewhere too though.

[12:21:46] detronizator_hom: AutomatedTester: done https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20975
[12:22:11] detronizator_hom: AutomatedTester: do you agree that the best behaviour should be to NOT accept cookies when the page is in that stage?
[12:22:28] AutomatedTester: detronizator_hom: I agree
[12:22:37] detronizator_hom: coolio
[12:22:40] AutomatedTester: 12:04 AutomatedTester: if you arent on the domain " invalid cookie domain - If the cookie's domain is not visible from the current page."
[12:22:51] dawagner has joined #selenium
[12:23:04] dawagner: FYI bringing down the CI for a couple of hours
[12:23:15] detronizator_hom: AutomatedTester: it's the current page bit that I think it's at fault
[12:23:31] detronizator_hom: because it doesn't mention the case where the page is in this "not ready to be used" state
[12:24:06] detronizator_hom: AutomatedTester: if it was clear, we won't have the issue in the first place, no?
[12:25:27] AutomatedTester: like I said, I think its already covered since you arent on a current page therefore its not visible
[12:25:48] AutomatedTester: but we can add in more text to say it a different way
[12:28:43] detronizator_hom: AutomatedTester: mmm, "since you arent on a current page" - is that something well defined?
[12:28:45] nirvdrum_ has joined #selenium
[12:28:46] detronizator_hom: a "current page" I mean?
[12:28:55] detronizator_hom: I know what YOU mena
[12:28:56] detronizator_hom: mean
[12:29:05] detronizator_hom: but "about:blank" could be a "current page" to me
[12:29:30] detronizator_hom: I know I'm being "anal" here, but I see where a 3rd person can come and get confused
[12:29:38] detronizator_hom: and I think confusion it's a bad thing

[16:07:43] ha6aha6a: if i used selenium webdriver with python instead of java would the tests run faster? which languages would run faster than java? all of them? :-)
[16:07:58] jimevans: :note santiycr indeed there is. one of the constructor overloads to RemoteWebDriver takes a System.TimeSpan which is the command timeout for the HttpCommandExecutor. I think this overload is also propagated to all of the browser-specific subclasses to expose the command timeout to them too.
[16:07:59] selbot2: ok!
[16:08:55] jimevans: ha6aha6a: i have no numbers to back this up, but i would guess that webdriver code is not computationally bound at the language binding level.
[16:09:25] jimevans: unless one of the language bindings is using a wildly inefficient HTTP client or JSON parser.
[16:09:38] dude-x: ha6aha6a: java or .net is fastest in terms of executing code, so it's a more time sensitive, but it won't make a difference in terms of test execution time.
[16:09:48] dude-x: A test that takes 10 seconds will still take 10 seconds on Python or Java
[16:10:06] ha6aha6a: jimevans: in english are you saying that it does not matter which language i use?
[16:10:09] ha6aha6a: ok got it
[16:10:24] ha6aha6a: jimevans: dude-x thank you
[16:10:51] dude-x: it matters when it comes to tricky javascript issues but test time is the same
[16:21:41] nirvdrum_: ha6aha6a: Your bottleneck is going to be the browser with any of the bindings.
[16:21:45] intchanter-work has joined #selenium
[16:24:05] ha6aha6a: nirvdrum_: yes you are right. it's the browser that takes forever. i want to run a long while statement in the code but i guess that will execute a lot faster than anything the browser does. i was also thinking if it was possible to call some c++ code from the java code to speed things up but maybe that is too sci fi
[16:24:33] nirvdrum_: Computers are really fast at looping.
[16:24:47] dude-x: ha6aha6a: it sounds like you're doing something a bit odd....
[16:24:58] ha6aha6a: nirvdrum_: yeah. what ineed is more ram :-)
[16:25:20] nirvdrum_: If RAM grows on each pass of your loop, you may have deeper problems :-P
[16:25:28] ha6aha6a: dude-x i have to loop through a bunch of elements
[16:25:30] garndt: O_o
[16:25:43] ha6aha6a: nirvdrum_: i mean more ram for the browser to start faster
[16:25:59] garndt: RAM will not increase the speed at which your browser launches 
[16:26:11] garndt: unless you have no available RAM to begin with, which then you have a lot larger problem
[16:26:11] dude-x: it's slow to loop through elements and extract text
[16:26:19] nirvdrum_: garndt: It will if you're swapping already, I suppose.
[16:26:24] nirvdrum_: Yeah.
[16:26:25] dude-x: so you may use javascript to extract text
[16:26:46] dude-x: other than that you should have machines with beefy ram to keep things running smoothly
[16:26:58] ha6aha6a: that's what i am saying
[16:26:58] dude-x: 8GB of RAM is my minimum these days

[17:05:40] lukeis: uppity how?
[17:05:59] lukeis: reload has been fraught with problems in my experience, so i don't use it
[17:07:02] dude-x: i am aware of those issues, but i told someone my experience with using supybot, where reload came in handy
[17:07:06] dude-x: with a plugin
[17:07:16] dude-x: because supybot actually resets the state of plugin modules
[17:08:03] dude-x: at least someone PM'ed me to tell me that I should pipe down because they try their best to not recommend using reload at all.
[17:10:11] cgoldberg: dude-x, reload is just asking for headaches :)

[18:19:03] cgoldberg: dude-x, do you use tox for Python?
[18:19:26] cgoldberg: i started using it recently.. tox and detox are blowing my mind.. I need to blog about them
[18:20:24] dude-x: cgoldberg: no but working with intchanter on python2-3 unification for python bindings i will begin to look into it
[18:20:59] cgoldberg: dude-x, supporting  python 2 and 3 is exactly what led me there
[18:22:50] cgoldberg: dude-x, detox is tox in parallel.  I can run my test suite (a tiny suite that runs in about 1.0 secs) across python 2.6/2.7/3.1/3.2/3.3/pypy .... and the overhead is about 2 extra seconds to setup virtualenvs and install dependencies
[18:23:30] dude-x: neat!
[18:23:54] cgoldberg: it's awesome
[18:24:35] cgoldberg: so in under 3 secs i can run all versions every change i make... 3-4 secs is about my threshold for instant feedback
[18:25:22] lukeis: heh… my 'instant' feedback for mobile is around 10 min :-/
[18:25:35] dude-x: sweet sassy molassy
[18:25:51] cgoldberg: and the config language is nearly identical to travis configs.. so as soon as i push a change (after running tox locally).. it gets tested again on travis-ci
[18:26:27] cgoldberg: lukeis, in 10 mins i've already forgot what I was waiting for
[18:26:34] lukeis: same here...
[18:26:54] lukeis: so it ends up taking me 30min ;) cause i already started doing something else
[18:27:19] lukeis: thus things like the upvote script...

[23:34:57] intchanter-work: For the rest of the work, it looks like running tests individually may be helpful.  Is it possible to target a single one, such as build/lib/selenium/test/selenium/webdriver/firefox/ff_alerts_tests.py ?
[23:35:43] intchanter-work: That one currently reports fail on all but one case, but I don't get the trace because build/lib/selenium/test/selenium/webdriver/firefox/ff_api_example_tests.py hangs.
