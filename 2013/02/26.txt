[08:20:28] Manoj_: barancev: i am taking a look at this issue.
[08:20:28] Manoj_: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=5047&q=Docs&colspec=ID%20Stars%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary#makechanges
[08:21:10] Manoj_: can be a browser version problem ? i see many ppl have faced that.
[08:21:12] barancev: Manoj_: yes, we need a repro for this issue
[08:21:42] Manoj_: they might have tried a higher version of firefox, 
[08:21:52] barancev: I's sure it's just a timing issue or an invalid locator
[08:21:54] Manoj_: in the stack trace I see that they are using 2.28
[08:22:32] barancev: may be an element with @id='usernameTextEdit' is in a frame
[08:22:52] Manoj_: yeah, it can be,
[08:23:00] barancev: it's impossible to debug without the page code
[08:23:13] SamuraiJack has joined #selenium
[08:23:18] Manoj_: but these kind of problems i see it occurs when ppl use firefox version higher and selenium version lower
[08:23:20] barancev: so I advide you to not spent your time on this issue :)
[08:23:40] Manoj_: like Firefox-19 and selenium library referenced may be 2.28 
[08:23:56] barancev: they used to run 2.28.0 and FF17
[08:24:17] barancev: Capabilities [{platform=XP, acceptSslCerts=true, javascriptEnabled=true, browserName=firefox, rotatable=false, locationContextEnabled=true, version=17.0.1, cssSelectorsEnabled=true, databaseEnabled=true, handlesAlerts=true, browserConnectionEnabled=true, nativeEvents=true, webStorageEnabled=true, applicationCacheEnabled=true, takesScreenshot=true}]
[08:25:26] Manoj_: Ahh there I see.
[08:25:54] Manoj_: 2.27 itself had the support for firefoc 17
[08:26:07] barancev: yes
[08:26:11] Manoj_: fine, then may be a frame issue or a page load issue.
[08:26:31] barancev: don't touch this issue, I'll close it in two days with the verdict "no repro in 1 month"
[08:26:42] Manoj_: their test may tries to find that element before the page renders.
[08:26:48] Manoj_: Alright. 
[08:26:58] Manoj_: thgouht of following it and closing it. 
[08:27:04] Manoj_: Glad I asked you now :)
[08:27:17] barancev: let them ask such questions in selenium user's group :)
[08:27:24] Manoj_: yes,,, :)

[10:51:02] Ardesco: sounds like you already have something running on socket 4500
[10:51:04] Ardesco: at a guess
[10:51:31] millenium: I'm searching in internet now but maybe I can find fast answer here also :)
[10:53:53] Ardesco: well no code and no stack trace doesn't help :)
[10:54:13] Ardesco: what os?
[10:54:41] millenium: I see some solutions like - renew your selenium packages, but I don't know how will reflect to my tests, that's why I'm caution
[10:54:48] millenium: on Win Serv 2008
[10:54:53] birnig01 has joined #selenium
[10:55:59] millenium: on my local machine it work fine (but my FF is 18 here) on win serv is v. 19 (I think it's because of this)
[10:56:29] millenium: or maybe the port is busy, but on netstat I didn't found it taken and it was working before fine
[10:59:46] millenium: there is no code Ardesco it's on init of FirefoxDriver

[11:09:25] millenium: I just update it to 2.30 I'll run my tests to see is everything is ok
[11:10:05] Ardesco: FF19 should run ok with 2.30.0
[11:10:10] Ardesco: it will break with 2.29.0
[11:10:26] Ardesco: (missed the fact you were using FF19)

[11:15:41] birnig01: Hello ... is there a Java property (or similar) that can be set to override where WebDriver writes temporary folders/files (such as Firefox profiles) ? (default being /tmp on unix systems)
[11:18:18] birnig01: We get a lot of junk (and some useful files) arrive in /tmp, it would be good to separate out the WebDriver ones 
[11:20:09] birnig01: This is partly discussed in http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1934 but I can't see an obvious solution
[11:29:00] Ardesco: System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir")); is your temp dir
[11:29:21] Ardesco: you could change it by doing a System.setProperty("java.io.tmpdir", "<tmpDirLocation>"));
[11:30:19] Turzai: hi guys, i have a problem with ie10 in win8 , the sendKeys function enters text very slowly, is there a workaround, or can you point me in a  direction on how to solve this issue? (master: jenkins, grid selenium plugin,slave: win8 with ie10)
[11:31:28] Ardesco_H has joined #selenium
[11:35:20] Ardesco: It's an expensive operation and the core IEDriver dev doesn't have access to an IE10 box yet
[11:35:33] Ardesco: in other words, what your seeing is most likely expected
[11:35:48] Ardesco: and IE10 isn't officially supported yet as far as I'm aware
[11:36:53] Turzai: thx for the information Ardesco
[11:38:38] birnig01: Ardesco: java.io.tmpdir seems to work, thanks for that, I saw previous postings that suggested it didn't work, so thought it couldnt be that simple ...
[11:39:45] Ardesco: heh

[16:06:23] eranm: jimevans, noticed that, it was very handy

[16:55:27] garndt: jimevans: what was the component that the IE driver uses that required the use of VS 2010 professional? I can't remember what that was.
[16:55:36] nirvdrum: lukeis: You've probably read about that utopia in software where you develop components and they're usable from all other languages as just drop-in items you wired up.  MS essentially built that.

[17:02:00] jimevans: i've only got disk space for one vm, so i've updated.
[17:02:12] nirvdrum: lukeis: Yeah.  But the same is true for the Mac & Linux solutions.  At least within the Windows ecosystem, COM is very consistent and Win 8 essentially works the same as Win XP.

[17:24:05] jimevans: garndt: then c++ will be challenging. if you're used to dynamic languages, statically-typed languages feel constricting (or so i'm given to understand)

[17:24:22] jimevans: if you'd said java or c#, c++ isn't that big a leap.

[18:54:33] jleyba: sayd: phantomjs specific
[18:55:06] sayd: jleyba: is it a bug? it shouldn't be timing out like that.. when i run the same code through the python interpreter it works

[18:55:39] jimevans: sayd: what are you doing when you get the timeout?
[18:55:50] jleyba: sayd: don't know if it's a bug.  but it's coming from the ghostdriver, not part of the selenium code base
[18:55:52] raboof: barancev: i think so (though I never actually used selenesse)
[18:56:08] sayd: not always, but seems like succcess rate is better within interpeter
[18:56:14] sayd: jimevans: i am doing a get
[18:56:34] jimevans: (sounds like the page load isn't completing, and it's reporting the page load timeout, which is set to some invalid value by default)

[21:14:22] jleyba: simonstewart: why?

[21:14:54] simonstewart: jleyba: For new webdriver implementations that add additional commands
[21:15:30] simonstewart: The spec allows the protocol to be extended
[21:15:44] simonstewart: But currently there's no way to add new command/url mappings to the httpcommandexecutor
[21:15:45] jleyba: simonstewart: Once upon a time I combined the protocol spec into a single class shared by client and server
[21:15:50] Swadq has joined #selenium
[21:16:02] jleyba: it could translate from HTTP request to Command and vice versa
[21:16:23] jleyba: probably still have it, the question is in which of my 500 svn clients did I leave it :)
[21:16:28] simonstewart: The two sides aren't always symmetrical 
[21:16:43] jleyba: When are they not?
[21:17:02] simonstewart: Like the iosdriver doesn't support every method that the normal remote driver do
[21:17:09] simonstewart: But does support additional commands
[21:17:13] simonstewart: (or, rather, could)
[21:17:25] simonstewart: But the httpcommandexecutor is shared 
[21:18:15] jleyba: httpcommandexecutor doesn't need to know about that nonsense.  give it a Command, it uses the Config class (forget what I called it) to get a HttpRequest
[21:18:21] jleyba: it executes request
[21:18:35] simonstewart: Right. But what if it's a command name that's not in the map of configs?
[21:18:55] jleyba: dependency injection - got a custom config, inject a custom config into the executor
[21:18:59] phishy has joined #selenium
[21:19:03] simonstewart: "-moz-kill-all-the-things"?
[21:19:14] simonstewart: The Config is a private static inner class
[21:19:40] simonstewart: But we are basically talking about how to allow new configs to be added to the command executor
[21:20:01] jleyba: HttpCommandExecutor() { this(evilDefaultStaticConfigInnerClass); }  HttpCommandExecutor(Config config) { this.config = config; }
[21:20:22] jimevans: the .net bindings neatly sidestep all of this by introducing a CommandInfoRepository class, which is a singleton repository of known commands.
[21:20:39] simonstewart: jimevans: I suspect we might want "per instance"
[21:20:44] jleyba: jimevans: yeah, that's basically what we need.  minus the evil singleton part
[21:20:47] simonstewart: Not every driver is an iosdriver

[21:38:01] selbot2: 03 open/new ClassCastException in sendkeys - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=5243 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Status-Untriaged]
[21:38:19] barancev: or we can say "it's a client's problem"
[21:38:45] plightbo has joined #selenium
[21:38:50] simonstewart: We should probably fix that
[21:39:10] barancev: they want the server to accept numbers and convert them to strings where appropriate
[21:39:51] barancev: accoring to the spec the parameter type is {Array.<string>}
[21:39:51] simonstewart: I only skimmed that
[21:40:04] jleyba: barancev: we should handle it in the client bindings
[21:40:06] lukeis: client bindings convert to string
[21:40:07] simonstewart: Oh.
[21:40:09] simonstewart: They're mad
[21:40:17] simonstewart: lukeis is correct
[21:40:23] simonstewart: As is jleyba 
[21:40:48] barancev: ok, then, "it's a client's problem" :)
[21:40:59] simonstewart: client bindings
[21:41:05] barancev: yes
[21:41:13] simonstewart: It's our problem, but not server side
[21:41:27] lukeis: in this case it's one of * php bindings
[21:41:27] barancev: it's perl binding
[21:41:31] lukeis: or perl
[21:41:36] simonstewart: Not our problem
[21:45:51] jimevans: here's my PSA for the day: if you're planning on staying at the conference hotel for SeConf, and you need to stay an extra night or two, you're out of luck. the hotel is sold out on wednesday and thursday night the week of the conf.
[21:46:49] jimevans: oh, and that's 10 fewer failures in the IE10 build with my doctype change. \o/
[21:47:00] lukeis: o/
[21:47:05] jimevans: \o
[21:47:08] simonstewart: Very cool
[21:47:22] simonstewart: Well, it compiles.
[21:47:32] jimevans: now if i could just figure out why we can't set a cookie in IE10 in the ci environment.

[21:48:36] lukeis: who stole the cookie from the cookie jar?  (can't help thinking of that every time… since I have a kids story i read on a regular basis that has it)

[21:52:49] nirvdrum: jimevans: On 64-bit windows, which IE is used by default?
[21:53:01] jimevans: should still be 32-bit IE
[21:53:25] nirvdrum: Well, that confirms what I'm seeing.  I guess I didn't need to spend two days getting this thing building for x64 :-P
[21:53:36] jimevans: nirvdrum: sorry, mate.
[21:53:41] nirvdrum: No problem.
[21:53:46] nirvdrum: It was a good exercise.
[21:53:57] nirvdrum: You just saved me a night of debugging why I can create an automation object.
[21:54:01] nirvdrum: *can't
[21:54:23] nirvdrum: I was afraid I'd try to load a 32-bit DLL into a 64-bit proc.  I hadn't really thought about the inverse problem.
[21:55:09] nirvdrum: jimevans: Do you recommend just using the 32-bit one?  Or should I set whatever capability to run as 64-bit?
[21:56:03] jimevans: i use 32-bit most often, because that's the one users use most often. they have to go out of their way to run 64-bit IE.

[21:57:14] jimevans: where's that list of registry changes y'all make for the CI environment?
[21:57:23] jimevans: (for IE, i mean)
[21:57:32] jimevans: i've lost that location
[21:58:43] nirvdrum: jimevans: Oh? I'm fairly new to Win 8.  I thought it used 64-bit by default from the new start screen.
[21:59:06] jimevans: nirvdrum: oh, windows 8. well that's a whole different kettle of fish.

[22:50:20] simonstewart: I'm not a fan of android right now
[22:53:04] jimevans: or perhaps barancev can check it for me.
[22:53:43] barancev: jimevans: how?
[22:54:05] jimevans: i dunno. can you spin up a ci vm and connect interactively to it?
[22:54:39] barancev: no, i don't know the password
[22:54:58] jimevans: then it'll have to be santiycr, i goes.
[22:55:09] jimevans: or guess even.
[22:55:23] barancev: and even with the password there is no access to the VM, only browser is under control
[22:55:58] barancev: I can run a Scout session under my accont
[22:56:43] jimevans: no, i really need registry access, specifically to the VMs we use in the CI environment for IE10 tests.
[22:59:11] barancev: sorry I was wrong

[22:59:27] barancev: what to search?

[23:05:32] freynaud has joined #selenium
[23:06:23] jimevans: santiycr: the value is 3 for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. we should try setting it to 0 to see what happens.
[23:06:51] santiycr: I can do that
[23:07:46] jimevans: if that fixes the cookie issue, i'll be very pleased.

[23:08:32] santiycr: ok, I'll need 1h to do it
[23:08:34] santiycr: on a meeting now
[23:08:47] jimevans: 3 for this value means "block all cookies" which would be consistent with the problems we're seeing in CI for IE10
[23:09:24] jimevans: and i honestly don't know what the interaction between HKLM and HKCU is in this case, which overrides which.

[23:34:59] intchanter-work: I thought HKCU should override HKLM because it's more specific.
[23:35:32] plightbo has joined #selenium
[23:35:50] jimevans: intchanter-work: not necessarily. since you have to be an admin to set HKLM, for security settings, it might be the case that HKLM overrides HKCU because it'
[23:35:59] jimevans: it's assumed an admin wanted it that way.
[23:37:25] noahsussman has joined #selenium
[23:38:38] jimevans: so with luck (though i'm not holding my breath) this will get rid of the majority of the remaining IE10 failures in the CI build, leaving us with only a small handful to diagnose.
[23:40:26] intchanter-work: Ugh... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry#Root_keys says that it may be application-specific, but that generally HKCU will be checked first, and HKLM will be the fall-back in case the entry isn't found.
[23:40:50] intchanter-work: But for security things, generally the "least privilege" principle is followed, which would necessitate checking all of them.
[23:41:39] intchanter-work: Er, or something close to that.  There may have been a minor misreading in there.
[23:42:02] llaskin has joined #selenium
[23:42:38] intchanter-work: A few more levels of exceptions to exceptions, and it might be eligible to succeed the English language.

[23:43:43] *lukeis watching a demo of a record/playback tool, and it injects sleeps for how long the user took in between actions (facepalm)
[23:44:34] intchanter-work: Should I add the invention of sleep() functions to my list of technical flaws to correct with time travel?
[23:44:56] intchanter-work: Or maybe just mandatory printed warnings when it's used?
[23:44:58] lukeis: sleep is useful… but people have abused it
[23:45:20] jimevans: you couldn't have "proper" waits without sleep().
[23:45:58] intchanter-work: True enough.  It's frustrating that it's easier to abuse than use properly, though.
[23:46:06] intchanter-work: And as a result tends to get abused more.
[23:46:25] llaskin: lukeis: that doesn't make sense to do at all
[23:46:31] llaskin: then you definitely are not speeding up testing at all
[23:46:38] llaskin: if it takes a user 1hr to test, it will take the automation the same time
[23:46:48] lukeis: you're replicating a manual tester… it's awesome...
