[00:43:35] davehunt_: plightbo_work: your silence speaks volumes ;)
[00:44:50] plightbo_work: maybe this weekend if I get time
[00:44:57] plightbo_work: the big issue for me with releases is documenting it all
[00:45:16] plightbo_work: I don't have a great system in place... check out the gh-pages branch to see what I do. it's all manual HTML editing. kind of sucks
[00:45:25] plightbo_work: doing the actual binary release takes a few minutes
[00:49:03] davehunt_: plightbo_work: fair enough
[00:49:27] davehunt_: looking forward to a release, but we'll be dependent on the python client too - I have a pull request already up for that
[00:49:45] davehunt_: once done, one of our sites becomes testable again! :D
[00:50:14] plightbo_work: woot
[00:53:00] intchanter-work: davehunt_: What's blocking your Python tests?
[00:53:16] davehunt_: intchanter-work: we just have one site behind basic authentication
[00:53:35] davehunt_: it's never been a huge priority, but always bothered me :)
[00:53:50] stephend: well, from time to time we have more :-)
[00:53:58] stephend: our MWC site was staged behind auth, for example
[00:54:06] davehunt_: argh, stephend will know I'm still awake!
[00:54:10] stephend: lol
[00:54:15] stephend: it's ok, we've talked about this
[00:54:17] stephend: we both do it, it's fine
[00:54:24] intchanter-work: I haven't tried basic auth with Selenium yet.
[00:54:26] stephend: it's still wind-down
[00:55:16] intchanter-work: My testing project is still early enough in development that I was able to get approval to add Python3 support.
[00:55:29] stephend: our webdevs are still on 2.6
[00:55:47] stephend: but they're looking at django 1.5 now, I hear
[00:55:55] stephend: so might move python up a bit
[00:55:58] intchanter-work: Then you'll be happy to know that 2.6+ and 3.1+ are both supported simultaneously on the new work.
[00:56:15] intchanter-work: Should make it less painful to do the migration when you're ready.
[00:56:19] stephend: yeah
[00:56:56] intchanter-work: I should update my sites to Django 1.5.  And then actually do something with them.

[14:35:09] nirvdrum: jimevans: It looks like handling basic authentication in IE could actually be pretty trivial.  The IWebBrowser2::navigate2 method takes a headers argument.
[14:36:10] jimevans: yeah, shouldn't be too tough.
[14:37:07] jimevans: as long as navigate2() allows basic authentication as part of the header, and it's not restricted because it could be a security risk
[14:38:36] nirvdrum: My take is they don't restrict it.  I haven't actually tried yet though.
[14:38:48] nirvdrum: Although this would only work for one level.
[14:39:10] nirvdrum: I've had people use basic auth on a site and then load in images from another host that also has basic auth.
[14:39:24] nirvdrum: IE will pop up a new basic auth dialog at that point since the realm is different.

[14:47:43] nirvdrum: Chrome, Firefox, & Safari all do it too.
[14:48:05] nirvdrum: Chrome is really cool though because they don't actually create a modal dialog.  They draw something on the canvas that looks and feels like a modal dialog.
[14:48:23] nirvdrum: So you can't even just dismiss it with an outside process.
[14:53:43] intchanter: I think my favorite thing about basic auth is that it works at all without encryption.
[14:54:04] intchanter: Nothing like replay attacks to help make your site secure.
[14:56:01] nirvdrum: intchanter: It was conceived in a simpler time.
[14:56:12] nirvdrum: intchanter: HTTP without SSL at all is generally a bad idea.
[14:56:22] intchanter: True on both counts.
[14:57:12] intchanter: I wish Convergence looked likely to replace the CA model for certificates so that we could eliminate the cost hurdle altogether.

[16:18:28] llaskin1: poror jim "The lesson, as always, I'm an idiot."
[16:18:40] ryanpetrello: we ran our Firefox web driver tests this AM and now Firefox just opens a new window and hangs
[16:18:47] ryanpetrello: to my knowledge, nothing has changed recently on our end
[16:18:57] ryanpetrello: but I did notice that FF released version 19.0.1 in the last day or so
[16:19:01] ryanpetrello: anybody else seeing similar issues?
[16:19:27] ryanpetrello: tried un/re installing Selenium IDE (latest)
[16:19:29] ryanpetrello: and no luck :\
[16:19:32] KaibutsuX: If I get 'yahoo.com' d.title is 'yahoo.com' then if I ele.click on an href='google.com' d.title is still 'yahoo.com'. It seems the iedriver doesn't clear out the title when it's about to change urls
[16:19:47] KaibutsuX: but if I ele.click, pause(1) then d.title is the new url
[16:20:13] annette has joined #selenium
[16:21:01] jimevans: KaibutsuX: it's entirely likely that IE hasn't had time to parse the html of the new page, and render the title to be the appropriate value when you're checking on it.
[16:21:47] jimevans: and the fact that "pause(1)" fixes it supports that theory.
[16:22:01] KaibutsuX: I'm ok with that, but now that means that a webdriverwait is useless, because it will always return the most recent title
[16:22:24] simonstewart: ryanpetrello: you must update to 2.30 or above for firefox 19 to work
[16:22:51] jimevans: KaibutsuX: i'm not sure i follow how that makes webdriverwait useless.
[16:23:22] simonstewart: IDE is the remit of Samit and adamgoucher, but I imagine it needs an update too
[16:23:46] KaibutsuX: jimevans: if I go from yahoo to google, I would expect that if I wait for title!=None, I could assume that means that I'm now on google, but instead it immediately returns yahoo.com while it's still pasing google
[16:23:55] KaibutsuX: *parsing even
[16:23:57] ryanpetrello: simonstewart: thanks, I'll give it a try
[16:24:24] jimevans: KaibutsuX: why would you wait for title != none? why wouldn't you wait for title == google?
[16:25:24] annette has left #selenium
[16:25:50] KaibutsuX: jimevans: because I don't always know what title to expect. From what I've seen in FF and chrome, if I go from yahoo to google, title will be None in between
[16:26:09] jimevans: KaibutsuX: now you're into browser quirks.
[16:26:15] KaibutsuX: ahh
[16:26:31] KaibutsuX: so it isn't webdriver that is 'clearing' the title in between loads?
[16:26:38] jimevans: nope.
[16:26:41] KaibutsuX: well shit
[16:26:56] jimevans: the driver is faithfully reporting whatever comes back from the browser.

[17:43:36] manoj: lol, i was puzzled to see that as well.
[17:43:47] lukeis: there's only so much i can do for people who choose not to read
[17:44:07] manoj: may be we can add… what is the Role of Client Driver (language specific bindings)
[17:44:17] manoj: as many ppl ask why do we want that.
[17:44:20] lukeis: all that info is there in various ways
[17:44:57] lukeis: the docs are repeating themselves in a few places now because no one wants to read 'all of it' ;)
[17:45:06] manoj: :)
[17:45:14] manoj: yeah, but i have seen many ppl asking this questions.
[17:45:28] manoj: Why and what is the need for selenium client driver for web driver project ? 
[17:46:21] manoj: they are clear that, rc needed that language specific bindings - but why for webdriver
[17:47:20] llaskin has joined #selenium
[17:47:22] plightbo has joined #selenium
[17:47:30] lukeis: it's the same thing for webdriver though, you *need* a client binding
[17:47:53] lukeis: the only difference is with the webdriver clients, you may *not need* the standalone server
[17:48:27] lukeis: a pretty picture on the projects/webdriver page would be appropriate
[17:50:16] manoj: lukeis: But even I have used web driver project without the client drivers
[17:50:30] lukeis: not sure how that's possible
[17:51:06] lukeis: you need java / c# / python / ruby / javascript / php / perl / haskell / <something else> to 'driver' it
[17:51:06] manoj: used, something like  - adding the standalone server.jar to my project buildPath and started working on it,
[17:51:10] manoj: its smooth
[17:51:22] lukeis: that's using the java client bindings
[17:51:36] lukeis: they happen to be bundled in the standalone server ;)
[17:51:45] manoj: ohh… I see.
[17:51:55] KaibutsuX: manoj: I use the python client bindings, but I never use the RC, because I only work with FF, chrome and IE
[17:51:56] manoj: :) so that's why..
[17:52:17] manoj: right, I understand. 
[17:52:30] manoj: Have been with Java for all these days, so didn't care what;s going on others.
[17:53:05] manoj: as lukeis: said standalone-server comes with java bundled :) so that made me not to worry on client drivers
[17:53:24] manoj: can we add these points and close that issue ?

[20:25:47] barancev: it is bundled in 2.31, but I'm worrying about maven
[20:26:23] lukeis: sounds like andreastt may have overlooked uploading to maven :)
[20:27:25] barancev: I know he did
[20:27:35] barancev: but may be not to the central directly
[20:27:58] lukeis: it only takes max 4 hours if he did it correctly :)

[20:29:08] barancev: yes, so is my concern
[20:32:19] barancev: I'm curious: why AndroidWebDriver.AndroidFindBy implements SearchContext ?
[20:32:58] barancev: or, in another words, why do we need this nested class at all?
[20:35:03] barancev: I'd suggest to flatten it

[20:46:51] intchanter-work: Python3-compatible package can now be downloaded at http://www.intchanter.com/media/selenium-2.31.0.tar.gz .  I recommend using virtualenv, and "pip install" will take the filename.  Comments welcome.
[20:48:49] ^A^kira: another computer, same issue - on click on login button IE spawns secondary window and doesnt register it's handle
[20:49:45] Osleg: How is it possible to debug -_-
[20:51:38] lukeis: debugging IE doesn't sound like fun… as a minimum you'll need Visual Studio and figure out how to build it yourself (in debug mode)
[20:52:04] lukeis: or giving a reproducible test case and hope that jim helps you out :)
[20:52:34] jimevans: Osleg: and that jim guy is a real ass, so you don't want him helping you.

[20:59:16] jimevans: unfortunately, it sounds like you've got a situation that's pretty environment-specific (happens on some machines but not others). is that right?
[20:59:21] Osleg: lukeis: it's pretty much impossible to give reproductible test since it requires USBkey
[20:59:33] Osleg: jimevans: no, it happened on 2 machines
[20:59:38] Osleg: both win7 and both ie9
[20:59:48] jimevans: oh, but those are the only two you've tried, then?
[20:59:57] Osleg: don't have windows machines anymore

[21:10:05] barancev: someone should do a release
[21:10:22] barancev: atm IDE generates illegal code for alert handling
[21:10:27] barancev: it is fixed in the HEAD

[21:10:43] barancev: push
[21:12:10] barancev: 4d3f89c5937c is the change that broke IDE generated code

[21:12:50] barancev: not covered by tests
[21:13:19] davehunt: right
[21:13:35] davehunt: barancev: did you fancy pushing out a release? :)
[21:14:25] barancev: is the procedure documented?
[21:14:58] barancev: and, btw, I'd get Samit blessing after his recent changes

[21:24:45] davehunt: jimevans: if I had either of those installed, I would :)
[21:24:52] davehunt: is it ugly?
[21:25:23] jimevans: well, IE9 displays for nice hebrew characters. IE10, not so much.
[21:26:10] jimevans: and it's because the server sends back "Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-16" in the headers
[21:26:50] jimevans: (IE9 is the "right" behavior, btw. or at least it matches firefox and chrome)
