[08:49:51] rightshift: I need to setup Selenium for the first time, does anyone have a moment to assist a new user?
[08:49:56] rightshift: Thanks in advance.
[08:50:02] dukeatcoding: where is your problem
[08:50:08] dukeatcoding: to start the grid its quite simple
[08:50:49] rightshift: hi dukeatcoding for one im not quite sure of what I need to install
[08:50:49] rbalent has joined #selenium
[08:50:50] rbalent has joined #selenium
[08:51:04] rightshift: there seem to be many components, ide's , webdrivers , i'm not a dev so I don't know what most of these are.
[08:51:23] rightshift: I'm just a techie trying to assist the testers with a setup
[08:51:33] rightshift: I would host selenium on an ubuntu 12.04lts box
[08:51:59] rightshift: and my testers would need to use it for firefox / chrome / ie / opera
[08:52:27] dukeatcoding: i run the hub on ubuntu and the nodes on windows right now
[08:52:29] dukeatcoding: is now problem
[08:52:34] dukeatcoding: just right the guide
[08:52:51] dukeatcoding: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/07_selenium_grid.jsp
[08:53:03] dukeatcoding: if you have problems afterwards you can come back
[08:53:15] rightshift: by nodes do you mean the testers machines?
[08:53:27] dukeatcoding: hehe you don√Ñt have a clue
[08:53:39] rightshift: nope
[08:53:39] dukeatcoding: read the link i sent you
[08:53:41] rightshift: i'm not a dev
[08:53:43] rightshift: or a tester
[08:53:46] dukeatcoding: doesnt matter
[08:53:47] rightshift: i'm a techie :P
[08:53:56] dukeatcoding: then you should be able to read 
[08:54:13] rightshift: is Selenium grid different to selenium
[08:54:16] rightshift: or just a component?
[08:54:20] rightshift: I can read and I will ;)
[08:54:35] smccarthy: rightshift: the selenium grid is to run tests on different machines (nodes)
[08:54:58] barancev: rightshift: grid is a server (or distributed network of selenium servers)
[08:55:02] smccarthy: rightshift: so you have a hub on one machine, and nodes on the other machines (and even a node on your hub machine).
[08:55:16] barancev: your testers shold use a client lib to develop tests
[08:55:23] smccarthy: rightshift: with the selenium grid, you can have some nodes have different browers, OSs, browser versions...
[08:55:32] barancev: and run the tests remotely on the server(s)
[08:55:45] smccarthy: rightshift: or you can just have all the same browser, OS, browser version for each node, and run your tests a lot faster
[08:56:01] barancev: to run the grid this info should be enough :wiki Grid2
[08:56:02] selbot2: 1: 03Grid2: gridseleniumwebdriver - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2
[08:56:19] smccarthy: rightshift: so if your tester runs the test from their machine, it will send the test to the hub, and the hub will send it to an open node.
[08:56:57] rightshift: smccarthy: i'm assuming then that I need spare machines for this?
[08:57:23] rightshift: smccarthy: i was under the assumption the testers could run tests from their own machines via the selenium server
[08:57:23] matthewrobbins has joined #selenium
[08:57:24] smccarthy: rightshift: yea. physical or virtual
[08:57:44] rightshift: smccarthy: is there no way of having them test from their own machines? I don't need a farm as such
[08:57:46] smccarthy: rightshift: if they want to run tests from their machine, and open the browsers on their machine, you can do that too
[08:58:09] smccarthy: rightshift: but thats not really a selenium grid. 
[08:58:25] rightshift: smccarthy: that sounds more like what they would be doing, local machine testing / scripts
[08:58:28] rightshift: smccarthy not a farm
[08:58:51] rightshift: smccarthy: dukeatcoding pointed me at the grid - do I perhaps need another setup? Its all a bit confusing
[08:59:52] smccarthy: In my point of view, a Selenium Grid is used in 2 cases. 1) You want to run multiple tests at the same time. or 2) You want to test browser versions and OSs

[09:00:34] stan has joined #selenium
[09:02:16] rightshift: smccarthy: thanks. Basically we are small, only 2 testers
[09:02:30] rightshift: smccarthy: they typically test off of their own machines and then maybe have 1 machine each for IE
[09:02:37] rightshift: smccarthy: they typically test off of their own machines and then maybe have 1 VM machine each for IE
[09:06:10] ebi: Is there a way to make selenium-server telling when its ready? i.e. wrtining a ready file or something?
[09:06:45] smccarthy: rightshift: ok. might want to get a grid setup since u do have to run tests on a different  (virtual) machine. Than you can have 1 VM for IE that both testers can use (as long as they dont need to test IE at the same time)
[09:07:05] smccarthy: gotta go tho
[09:08:55] Manoj_: rightshift: I think there was same questiong from you yesterday too..
[09:09:01] Manoj_: still ahven't done with that ?
[09:09:31] rightshift: No i'm revisting it now Manoj_ - I looked @ your site but it appears to timeout or not load for me at times.
[09:10:12] Manoj_: rightshift: that's ridiculous, it should be fine all time up and running.
[09:10:32] Manoj_: alright, no prob.
[09:10:36] rightshift: It could quite possibly be my side - our upstream provider has been having international connectivity issues.
[09:10:44] Manoj_: have a good time using selenium
[09:10:59] rightshift: I'm trying but its not easy for a new user to pickup
[09:11:08] rightshift: they need to define which components you need in an easier way
[09:11:09] rightshift: im still lost
[09:12:34] rightshift: I dont know what I need to use for what

[09:21:53] One-Man-Bucket: how do i check if a string is present on a page?
[09:21:59] One-Man-Bucket: in webdriver.
[09:22:19] One-Man-Bucket: selenium had a isTextPresent(string) method
[09:22:20] Manoj_: I would suggest, if you many questions you can draft a post and post in the Selenium-Users group.
[09:24:06] Manoj_: One-Man-Bucket: First of all such  a long name to type :P
[09:24:32] Manoj_: you are right webdriver doesnt have a direct API to determine the TextPresent 
[09:24:42] Manoj_: but you can achieve that in other ways.
[09:24:53] One-Man-Bucket: right?
[09:25:15] Manoj_: its already been asked by many and few suggesstions here : https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/selenium-users/jRX7Ogu5WZI
[09:26:12] Manoj_: something like this
[09:26:14] Manoj_: boolean isTextPrest=false;
[09:26:20] Manoj_: isTextPrest=driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[contains(.,'WebDriver')]")).isDisplayed();  
[09:26:47] Manoj_: or
[09:26:48] Manoj_: boolean b = driver.getPageSource().contains(text);             return b;
[09:26:55] Manoj_: which ever you feel better.
[09:28:56] One-Man-Bucket: would pagesource() catch text that has been inserted into the DOM after page load?
[09:31:48] Manoj_: it would, I guess. 
[09:32:00] Manoj_: if not try using the xpath contains method

[10:03:59] One-Man-Bucket: ~250 less than yesterday :)
[10:14:01] dukeatcoding: hehe
[10:14:10] dukeatcoding: do you test with several browsers at the same time ?
[10:14:19] dukeatcoding: or do you have multiple seperated runs ?
[10:16:41] One-Man-Bucket: yeah, we're running 16 browser simultaneous, iirc
[10:17:35] One-Man-Bucket: 16 parallel junit runners 
[10:27:01] Phil37 has joined #selenium
[10:27:46] dukeatcoding: ok
[10:27:52] dukeatcoding: because i was wondering
[10:28:01] dukeatcoding: how to define multiple capabilities
[10:28:08] dukeatcoding: so you define a capability each
[10:28:13] dukeatcoding: and get a remote driver each
[10:28:16] dukeatcoding: ?
[10:28:41] One-Man-Bucket: each runner has it's own webdriver
[10:28:52] dukeatcoding: thats what i thought
[10:28:59] dukeatcoding: i am thinking about adding another layer
[10:29:08] dukeatcoding: where you can specify a list of cabalities
[10:29:17] dukeatcoding: which your then are tested in a loop or someting
[10:29:20] dukeatcoding: do you think there is a problem ?
[10:29:33] dukeatcoding: are their differences when you test different browsers ?
[10:34:42] One-Man-Bucket: we're only testing with firefox atm
[10:35:51] dukeatcoding: but differnt versions
[10:35:55] dukeatcoding: like 13, 15....
[10:36:10] dukeatcoding: so you start your testclient with a version parameter
[10:36:26] One-Man-Bucket: one version of firefox
[10:36:59] dukeatcoding: ah so "only" 16 test cases
[10:37:01] dukeatcoding: with the same firefox
[10:37:38] One-Man-Bucket: no, 1200 tests which are run by 16 parallel test runners
[10:37:48] One-Man-Bucket: using the same firefox (latest)
[10:37:51] dukeatcoding: ah ok ;)
[10:37:54] dukeatcoding: now i got it
[10:38:02] dukeatcoding: i am doing a little research for doing your 1200 tests
[10:38:07] dukeatcoding: on 1200 configurations
[10:38:10] dukeatcoding: os x browser x flash
[10:38:11] dukeatcoding: ;)
[10:40:31] One-Man-Bucket: yeah, we can't afford to test on different browser permutations i think
[10:40:57] dukeatcoding: maybe you can in about 2 monts
[10:41:07] dukeatcoding: don't know how much you wont to spend
[10:41:12] dukeatcoding: but we will over it as a service
[10:41:14] One-Man-Bucket: we're already experiencing platform explosions... our master branch runs on 55 platforms
[10:41:34] One-Man-Bucket: adding a browser dimension would be too expensive
[10:41:58] One-Man-Bucket: but maybe we could fit in a chrome/safari run on a weekly basis 
[10:42:33] dukeatcoding: our plattform
[10:42:36] dukeatcoding: www.testchameleon.com
[10:42:40] dukeatcoding: offers atm about 1200 configurations

[13:39:56] One-Man-Bucket: dukeatcoding: yeah, before i joined the company they were experimenting with running tests in EC2
[13:40:27] One-Man-Bucket: iirc they had to scrap that because for some reason we got really slow (~500kb/s) speeds to amazon
[13:41:06] One-Man-Bucket: and our packaged distribution is a couple of hundred megabytes.. or at least it was back then

[13:45:33] Ardesco: we ru  our tests in EC2

[13:45:37] Ardesco: and it's all good
[13:45:40] Ardesco: well some of them
[13:45:48] Ardesco: not the OSX one ovbiously
[13:45:58] Ardesco: we have a mac mini knocking around to do that
[13:46:01] dukeatcoding: so you have your selenium nodes at amazon ?
[13:46:15] Ardesco: we don't have selenium nodes
[13:46:25] Ardesco: We are looking at offloading IE tests to sauce atm
[13:46:38] Ardesco: we don't run a grid, no need
[13:46:41] dukeatcoding: saucelabs or what ?

[13:46:54] Ardesco: saucelabs or saucelabs

[13:47:06] Ardesco: at the moment all of them
[13:47:18] dukeatcoding: with selenium
[13:47:21] dukeatcoding: standalone ?
[13:47:23] dukeatcoding: so no grid
[13:47:24] Ardesco: yup

[13:47:32] dukeatcoding: intersting
[13:47:40] dukeatcoding: what kind of interface to you get to the EC2 btw ?
[13:47:44] dukeatcoding: always wondered
[13:47:49] dukeatcoding: do you get SSH, RDP or something ?
[13:47:53] Ardesco: define interface
[13:47:58] Ardesco: the machines are just remote servers
[13:48:06] dukeatcoding: jep how do you access them
[13:48:10] Ardesco: ssh
[13:48:10] dukeatcoding: via common protocols
[13:48:17] dukeatcoding: ok so linux servers via ssh
[13:48:17] Ardesco: browser
[13:48:27] Ardesco: some linux, some windows
[13:48:37] dukeatcoding: do you get windows remote desktop for the windows ones ?
[13:48:42] Ardesco: we don't

[13:49:30] Ardesco: but we never look at them anyway tbh
[13:49:36] dukeatcoding: hehe
[13:49:40] Ardesco: stack trace and a screenshot is enough
[13:49:49] dukeatcoding: so the code deployment testing goes fully automated ?
[13:50:01] Ardesco: yup
[13:50:03] Ardesco: jenkins
[13:50:11] Ardesco: every time somebody pushes to git
[13:50:20] Ardesco: jenkins deploys new war file to apache
[13:50:25] Ardesco: and then tests get kicked off
[13:50:52] Ardesco: and because they run standalone the devs can run all automated tests before they push
[13:51:02] Ardesco: so we rarely get failures
[13:51:08] Ardesco: normally an env thing, 
[13:51:46] dukeatcoding: sounds nice
[13:51:58] dukeatcoding: a lot of people seem to use jenkins / mavin
[13:52:05] dukeatcoding: getting there things done
[13:52:55] Ardesco: tbh gradle/groovy  is equivalent of java/maven
[13:53:05] Ardesco: would do it exactly the same way with maven
[13:55:52] dukeatcoding: i got selenium code from one client here right now
[13:56:05] dukeatcoding: they use a maven / gradle / groovy / spock combination

[16:04:07] itatitat: or how might I make this?
[16:04:28] dude-x: i don't understand the question
[16:04:33] dude-x: can you rephrase it
[16:05:18] dude-x: if you want the html source, you can use webdriver's page_source command, depending on the programming language you use
[16:05:19] dukeatcoding: i think he wants
[16:05:22] dukeatcoding: to have nice html reports
[16:05:26] itatitat: yes, the problem is that I need to parse the content along different pages, which appear when a user make login. 
[16:05:28] dukeatcoding: TestNG 
[16:05:30] itatitat: yes, exactly, is that
[16:05:38] dukeatcoding: with some modules
[16:05:48] dukeatcoding: can generate HTML / PDF output
[16:05:51] dukeatcoding: for example
[16:05:57] dukeatcoding: there are a lot of ways out there
[16:06:07] dukeatcoding: did some research last week
[16:06:17] dukeatcoding: depends highly on the testclient language u use
[16:07:12] itatitat: im using php, really all the examples I saw was with java and intellij, the problem is that I dont see where the object selenium come from in all those examples...I need a library?, because I tried to create a selenium object in my tests and I was having errors
[16:07:22] itatitat: someone with experience on this?
[16:07:56] dukeatcoding: java has the most options
[16:08:05] itatitat: yes, indeed
[16:08:07] dukeatcoding: maybe you search for the term phpunit report
[16:08:15] dukeatcoding: there is something out
[16:08:19] dukeatcoding: as equivalent to junit
[16:08:26] dukeatcoding: phpunit it must be called i think
[16:08:27] itatitat: yes, for me is phpunit
[16:08:35] dukeatcoding: there should be some options to display phpunti results
[16:08:38] itatitat: jummm, ok, thanks a lot
[16:08:53] itatitat: then the idea is to use the selenium object, webdriver

[16:21:33] is_null: hi all, how to assert that a page was reloaded **or** that a javascript function was called ?
[16:21:58] KaibutsuX: I think you would need a global handler for that type of thing on your page, at least for the js
[16:21:59] dude-x: is_null: do you have control of the code written?
[16:22:47] is_null: dude-x: yes ... but i'd rather avoid to put test code in it
[16:23:43] dude-x: you can put a variable like reload_count = 0 in the html code. and if the page is refreshed the javascript function (or the web controller) will increment that count
[16:24:29] dude-x: or you can inject a variable using execute_script but I don't know if that works‚Ä¶ never tried that
[16:25:02] KaibutsuX: it does it you make sure to make it global, execute_script(window['myvar'] = 'asd')

[16:46:49] is_null: i just tried naively to instanciate another browser after loggin in the first one, and it's not authenticated - it looks like cookies aren't shared, which makes sense since tests must be isolated, but in this case inappropriate
[16:47:30] dude-x: webdriver instances on firefox are different profiles
[16:47:51] dude-x: unless you use a specific profile
[16:48:20] dude-x: but i feel that you may get 'concurrency' issues
[16:48:53] is_null: maybe it's possible to open another tab in the same firefox instance ?
[16:49:21] dude-x: the default firefox profile disables tabs
[16:49:25] jleyba has joined #selenium
[16:49:29] dude-x: kind of

[16:52:50] dude-x: in python, profile = FirefoxProfile('path/to/profile')
[16:53:02] dude-x: driver = webdriver.Firefox(profile)
[16:53:21] dude-x: i don't think it will work though
[16:53:32] dude-x: firefox prohibits two instances of the same browser using the same proifle

[18:11:07] santiycr: I'm collecting them for chrome as well, though only trunk build of selenium can make that happen
[18:11:20] santiycr: and I'm waiting for being able to do the same with IE
[18:11:46] santiycr: which I can make happen if you're bussy
[18:12:04] santiycr: just didn't want to duplicate work if you were already working on it
[18:12:29] barancev: yes, I saw, but the FF logs seems to be different from what is on FF error console
[18:12:45] barancev: I hoped to get all this info...
[18:13:09] santiycr: maybe the loglevel is too high?
[18:13:24] barancev: I'll do this for IE, but after 2.30
[18:13:44] santiycr: oh, I can make it happen before then, if that's ok with you

[18:14:54] santiycr: WTF
[18:15:27] santiycr: there's something wrong with these jars or vms
[18:15:32] santiycr: I can't think of what it is
[18:15:42] santiycr: hell, we can turn on automatic requeue 
[18:16:26] santiycr: none of our users ever get bit by this, due to our system figuring this stuff out and re-assigning the job to a new vm
[18:18:25] barancev: what's bad with auto requeueing for selenium CI jobs?
[18:19:25] dawagner: It used to stop us from getting error logs, IIRC?
[18:20:09] santiycr: I thought that wasn't a great idea for selenium-ci, cuz it would basically let the project get away with reliability issues in startup 
[18:20:35] santiycr: dawagner:  I fixed that since we moved away from requeing 
[18:20:53] santiycr: but yeah, that was also a problem
[18:21:22] santiycr: and by 'get away' I mean 'loose visibility'

[18:47:01] barancev: aha, "drag and drop an element onto another when draggable is out of viewport"
[18:47:34] jimevans: barancev: there's a test case for it in watirspec. dawagner was working with one of the commenters on it at one time.
[18:48:52] barancev: there were lots of improvements in scrolling since last Feb
[18:50:05] barancev: no I still can't run WDBS tests here
[18:50:11] barancev: "TypeError: Pb.ba is undefined"
[18:50:17] barancev: even after go clean
[18:50:52] jimevans: i've just been assigned an issue internally that doing a mouseover throws the dreaded MoveTargetOutOfBoundsException, and i'm in the process of tracking it down. 
[18:51:03] barancev: according to the map, Pb.ba should mean core.locators

[18:53:08] dawagner: jimevans: I spent a while looking at it back when it was reported, and then got distracted
[18:53:14] dawagner: There were like 30 different causes for it, IIRC
[18:53:49] jimevans: well that kinda sucks
[18:54:07] dawagner: I can put you in touch with some people who have sent me private repros off-list
[18:54:47] jimevans: no thanks. :) i just wondered if we'd found a definitive cause and/or workaround that hadn't been updated in the issue report.

[19:22:47] llaskin: what attribute can I check on a radio button to see if it enabled or not?
[19:25:19] jimevans: llaskin: dunno. the lack of a "disabled" attribute? why wouldn't "element.enabled?" work for you?
[19:25:50] KaibutsuX has joined #selenium
[19:26:36] jimevans: (you're using ruby, right? i think i got that syntax correct)
[19:27:51] llaskin: yes you did
[19:27:55] llaskin: but enabled returns true regardless here...
[19:29:16] jimevans: well that sounds suboptimal
[19:30:09] simonstewart has joined #selenium
[19:30:44] llaskin: if i element.attribute("checked") it returns true if selected, and nil if unselected
[19:31:30] llaskin: thats the check LOL
[19:31:38] _SjG_ has joined #selenium
[19:32:24] jimevans: but checked doesn't mean enabled.
[19:33:24] jimevans: and if you're looking to see if the radio button value is checked or not, try element.selected?
[19:33:51] _SjG_: I'm injecting Javascript into a page during testing using getEval(). This seems to runs in the context of Selenium, not of my page. I can access things in my page, but am having a difficult time with jQuery. It seems filters are in the wrong context. 
[19:34:50] lukeis: _SjG_: in RC you need to pre-pend  "this.browserbot.getUserWindow()"
[19:35:35] _SjG_: lukeis: Well, that works for things like selectors, but if I pass an anonymous function to filter the selector, it fails
[19:35:39] _SjG_: for example:
[19:36:30] _SjG_: getEval("var window=selenium.browserbot.getUserWindow();k = window.$(':contains(test)').filter(function(){return true;})")
[19:36:40] _SjG_: without the filter, I get back results
[19:36:46] _SjG_: with the filter, I don't
[19:37:35] _SjG_: I'm not sure the problem is context, but I'm bewildered :)
[19:38:30] lukeis: yeah‚Ä¶ jquery itself uses 'window'
[19:39:01] _SjG_: oh... so is it a namespace clash?
[19:39:06] *_SjG_ tries a different name
[19:39:06] lukeis: yeah
[19:39:14] lukeis: well, yes and no
[19:39:43] lukeis: jquery is likely picking up the control window rather than the target window, which is what you want...
[19:40:11] lukeis: time to switch to WebDriver :-D
[19:40:32] _SjG_: unfortunately, I have to drive this out of PHPUnit
[19:40:44] lukeis: there's webdriver bindings for php
[19:40:57] _SjG_: ok. I'll look into that.
[19:40:59] _SjG_: thanks.
[19:41:09] lukeis: _SjG_: https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver
[19:43:32] *_SjG_ clicks
[19:45:26] _SjG_: when I have that working, will I just use "execute" to inject my JS?

[20:18:54] dude-x has joined #selenium
[20:19:07] monk12: Hey all, just curious if there are good solutions to use Selenium and also database testing. like on after step 6, check the database to assert a value is there. 'Testing Anywhere' has that ability to record web things and check things in database but its not as nice to me as Selenium IDE. be cool if you can setup a driver and get Selenium to assert things in DB.
[20:20:36] jarib: monk12: selenium is a browser automation tool. your tests can call out to the DB if you'd like, but it's not something selenium cares about.
[20:20:42] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[20:20:46] jimevans: monk12: that's going to be a hard sell here. IDE isn't set up to do things like that, which is why i'd recommend exporting your code to a "real" programming language (java, c#, ruby, python). then you have all of the functionality available from libraries in that language.
[20:22:18] jimevans: gotta run grab a mid-afternoon cuppa. 
[20:22:39] monk12: Gotcha, and I can just test for database in there via jdbc etc... Thanks.
[20:23:02] monk12: Is there like a 'DBUnit' you can use in that java code. simple asserts for values in tables?
[20:23:40] monk12: (sorry i guess thats more a java question.)
