[06:05:57] SamuraiJack: the SafariDriver wiki page says now: Starting with Selenium 2.30.0, the SafariDriver comes bundled with the Selenium server
[06:06:26] SamuraiJack: does that mean that there will be no need to manually compile and install the extenstion to the safari?
[06:06:46] SamuraiJack: and - any hints about when 2.30.0 going to be released?

[06:51:07] barancev: sam___: WebDriver emulates a "human user" actions. a user can't deal with invisible popups => it is disabled in WebDriver
[06:51:48] barancev: of course you can use executeJavascript if you want, it's a kinda "advanced user with JS console"
[06:52:41] barancev: SamuraiJack: yes, in 2.30 there will be no need to compile and install safari plugin manually
[06:53:22] SamuraiJack: barancev: great news!
[06:54:38] SamuraiJack: barancev: is it already in the sources? I mean - if I'll build everything from sources it should work?
[06:54:59] barancev: yes, it should if you build from the HEAD

[08:02:25] One-Man-Bucket: barancev: hehe no.. i'm experimenting with migrating our 1200 web tests to webdriver.. and we have a matryoshka-style wrapping framework around selenium
[08:02:44] One-Man-Bucket: apparently this seems to be caused by trying to select the element before the frame has finished loading or something

[12:47:30] SamuraiJack_ has joined #selenium
[12:50:12] jimevans: Ardesco: i don't necessarily agree. temporarily using sleep() during development can sometimes be instructive as to the source of a failing test.
[12:50:30] *jimevans is being pedantic about the use of "never" and "always" today.
[12:52:26] Ardesco: but most people using it in tests or suggesting using it on the mailing lists are not using it that way
[12:52:31] Ardesco: so easier to say never
[12:53:31] Ardesco: by the time they have got to the level where they can use it in the correct way, they will know that *never* is not always valid

[14:56:12] jimevans: hooray!
[14:56:40] Ardesco: IE tests are still much slower than other tests
[14:56:50] Ardesco: but that's more to do with IE's JavaScript engine IMHO
[14:57:10] Ardesco: worth nothing that IE is about 25-30 times slower in sun spider than chrome
[14:57:12] jimevans: Ardesco: probably so.
[14:57:32] jimevans: even 32-bit IE9?

[IRC logfile - Started Thu Feb  7 15:00:11 2013]
[15:00:11] Ardesco: don't take into account the fact that we have extra CSS and JavaScript fixes for IE support
[15:00:18] Ardesco: so IE is probably rendering more JS
[15:00:22] Ardesco: making it even slowe
[15:00:23] Ardesco: r
[15:00:40] jimevans: Ardesco: understood.
[15:00:42] Ardesco: the tests that are very slow are ones that invloe heavy JS rendering
[15:00:50] AutomatedTester: thats the other thing people never take into account
[15:01:35] Ardesco: basically I'm very happy with current IE driver
[15:01:45] Ardesco: last 40 builds have been green
[15:02:06] Ardesco: it wasn't like that before i turned on the requireWindowFocus
[15:02:09] Ardesco: capability
[15:02:54] Ardesco: (we only have the last 40 stored in history, so it's probably more than that)
[15:04:16] jimevans: I would expect the requireWindowFocus capability to be discussed at SeConf in june. :)
[15:05:08] *garndt feels that he should check out requireWindowFocus
[15:07:34] jimevans: my gut feeling is that SendInput() is faster than the SendMessage() travesty we're using under normal circumstances, but i've done no benchmarking to back that up.
[15:09:22] AutomatedTester: has anyone got test cases that isDisplayed being slow?
[15:09:35] *AutomatedTester wants to use them to bench mark and optimise that algorithm
[15:10:27] qaguy has joined #selenium
[15:10:45] jimevans: is the isDisplayed algorithm documented in the spec yet? (i'm too lazy to look)
[15:10:51] AutomatedTester: yes
[15:10:59] AutomatedTester: I documented it
[15:11:13] AutomatedTester: so what it does, therefore what is in the spec, will remain unchanged

[16:03:29] Ardesco: IMHO
[16:03:30] Ardesco: :)
[16:03:46] jimevans: no, it's fine to leave it ignored.
[16:04:01] Ardesco: s/on/only
[16:04:02] jimevans: it's the only ignored alert test for IE at the moment afaik
[16:04:10] Ardesco: s/i.e./IE/
[16:05:39] barancev|2: jimevans: yes, it fails in IE 6 and 7
[16:05:45] jimevans: Ardesco: if only that were the case. but as long as vista is still a supported OS, and upgrading to IE > 7 is not mandatory for vista users, i can't make that convincing argument. IE6 is in a similar state, though XP is going to be unsupported by MSFT soon, it still has a large install base.
[16:06:16] Ardesco: currently pushing to drop IE8 support here
[16:06:26] Ardesco: or at least invoke an IE8 tax on customers
[16:06:39] barancev: jimevans: also, do you want me to implement an option to set requireWindowFocus capability in SauceDriver?
[16:06:55] Ardesco: e.g. product will cost you this much, if you want it to work in IE* it costs X evtra
[16:07:48] AutomatedTester: IE9 + are good browsers
[16:08:03] intchanter-work: Selenium -- dragging the world kicking and screaming onto the modern web.  :-p
[16:08:40] jimevans: barancev: if you have time, but i don't anticipate enabling it as a permanent thing. i just wanted to see if it would positively affect run times.
[16:09:13] jimevans: and if it would help pass rates on IE10

[16:19:28] jimevans: Ardesco: it's the only option for windows 7 users...
[16:19:34] Ardesco: yup
[16:19:47] Ardesco: and that's the big problem with MS's current browser strategy
[16:19:48] AutomatedTester: and XP will be around for at least another 2 years
[16:20:04] AutomatedTester: especially in businesses
[16:20:13] Ardesco: I can see exactly why they built it into the OS years back in an attempt to lock down the market
[16:20:49] AutomatedTester: it was more to simplify other apps
[16:21:09] AutomatedTester: and to simplify how people work on intranet vs internet
[16:21:27] intchanter-work: And as a performance optimization, skipping several security layers that turned out to be necessary after all.
[16:21:53] AutomatedTester: sod... killed another mobile phone...
[16:22:02] intchanter-work: But mostly to try to kill Netscape.
[16:22:12] AutomatedTester: the did kill netscape
[16:22:21] AutomatedTester: did a very good job on that
[16:22:39] Ardesco: but it's now preventing them from moving quickly with browser development
[16:22:50] Ardesco: FF and chrome are miles ahead of them now
[16:23:00] intchanter-work: Also got them convicted as a monopolist.
[16:23:09] Ardesco: meh
[16:23:19] Ardesco: like that actually made a difference to them
[16:23:53] jimevans: intchanter-work: i'd be much more impressed with that statement if having a monopoly were, you know, illegal
[16:23:56] intchanter-work: It should have made more of a difference, as many regional governments and some national ones have regulations prohibiting doing business with convicted monopolists.
[16:24:14] jimevans: (at least in the U.S.)
[16:24:36] intchanter-work: jimevans: Convicted of anti-trust violations is the more technically accurate way to say it.
[16:24:50] AutomatedTester: were they convicted in the US?
[16:25:00] AutomatedTester: thought it was purely in the EU
[16:25:30] intchanter-work: I thought I remembered yes, but after you ask I'm not so sure.
[16:25:47] jimevans: no, not convicted. the case was settled.
[16:25:52] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[16:26:02] AutomatedTester: since only the EU made them have a thing asking which browser would they like
[16:26:05] jimevans: s/settled/settled without a trial verdict/
[16:26:22] AutomatedTester: which means they were not convicted...
[16:26:50] *intchanter-work adds that to his list of things to correct after time travel is invented.

[21:27:16] stackedsax1: slf4j-api-1.6.6.jar
[21:27:16] stackedsax1: slf4j-log4j12-1.6.6.jar
[21:27:16] stackedsax1: log4j.jar
[21:27:27] barancev: and when you run a Java process you should set a property -Djava.util.logging.config.file=pathtothefilelogging.properties
[21:27:45] stackedsax1: and then I'll need a log4j.xml config file on the classpath too
[21:28:05] barancev: if you want to redirect then from slf4j to log4j -- yes
[21:28:15] stackedsax1: for the moment I'll use log4j, yeah
[21:28:18] barancev: but you'd better use logback as a backend
[21:28:32] barancev: though, it's up to you
[21:28:33] stackedsax1: just to prove that the zeromq or redis appenders work
[21:28:47] stackedsax1: later, I can convert those appenders to logback
[21:29:31] stackedsax1: they don't exist yet, but one of the reasons to use slf4j would be to switch log4j out easily once I've converted those suckers

[21:31:18] stackedsax1: although, for my purposes, I don't know exactly what the benefit is with logback. just seems like the community recognizes logback as shinier.

[22:39:22] kentor: how do I make sure that selenium waits for a page to fully load ? I am loading an app on facebook but selenium exists before I get the whole page loaded so the .har file is empty
[22:40:32] lukeis: you, my friend, have stumbled into the halting problem :)
[22:41:09] kentor: how do i solve it :)
[22:42:30] barancev: how do you as a human understand that the page is fully loaded?
[22:43:05] lukeis: you'll need to determine what 'fully loaded' means to you and then wait for that to happen
[22:43:22] kentor: well, once the progress bar is at 100% on the fb app, i can start using it
[22:43:30] kentor: alright
[22:43:37] kentor: how do i wait for a certain file to load
[22:43:52] kentor: on that page
[22:44:50] barancev: how do you understand it is "fully loaded"? may be loading the file was broken in the middle due to a network failure?
[22:45:41] barancev: use something more deterministic as a criterion
[22:45:44] kentor: file needs to be of a certain size
[22:45:52] kentor: so i want to make sure i got that file(s)
[22:45:58] kentor: and they meet my size conditions
[22:46:24] barancev: and you have a proxy (that creates har, and can watich the file to be downloaded fullsize)
[22:46:47] barancev: so the proxy should tell you this
[22:46:48] kentor: im using browermob proxy yes
[22:47:23] kentor: interesting, ok ill try to find some examples
[22:47:28] barancev: btw, "file downloaded" != "the browser used the info from this file to update the page"
[22:52:16] phishy has joined #selenium
[22:53:20] kentor: what do you mean
[22:55:44] barancev: browser can spend some additional time to use information from the loaded file
[22:56:03] barancev: before it will be available on the page
[22:56:28] kentor: ah ok, thats o
[22:56:29] kentor: ok*

[23:13:49] AutomatedTester: sorry I havent replied to your email, been swamped
[23:14:00] kentor: no :(
[23:14:06] kentor: i gave up
[23:14:16] AutomatedTester: :(
[23:14:19] kentor: i've tried python and java
[23:14:20] kentor: both failed
[23:14:35] kentor: i am even seeing a lot of stuff happening
[23:14:40] kentor: but im just not getting the har file
[23:14:45] kentor: everything else i can get
[23:14:47] kentor: i can get all the content
[23:14:58] kentor: something about the proxy/ports is failing and i don't know what i tis
[23:15:00] kentor: it us*
[23:15:03] kentor: it is*
[23:15:27] kentor: if you have any suggestions, i will definitely try them :)
[23:15:33] AutomatedTester: did the example in http://oss.theautomatedtester.co.uk/browsermob-proxy-py/ work for you?
[23:15:48] AutomatedTester: with your setup?
[23:16:01] AutomatedTester: with XVFB + browsermob + selenium
[23:16:22] jimevans has left #selenium
[23:16:34] kentor: yes basically the har is empty
[23:16:44] kentor: i see some output but its empty
[23:18:23] AutomatedTester: kentor: in the email you sent me you arent telling FirefoxDriver to use the proxy
[23:19:27] AutomatedTester:  profile  = webdriver.FirefoxProfile()
[23:19:27] AutomatedTester:                 profile.set_proxy(proxy.selenium_proxy())
[23:19:27] AutomatedTester:                 driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile)
[23:19:27] AutomatedTester: that isnt in your example
[23:19:27] AutomatedTester: that will give you empty HARs
[23:19:27] AutomatedTester: if not done
[23:21:19] AutomatedTester: kentor: ^
[23:21:48] kentor: ok let me check

[23:23:20] qaguy has left #selenium
[23:25:46] kentor: when I do that, I can no longer get the title (which is fine, i don't care about the content that much right now), but the har is still empty http://pastie.org/6091156
[23:27:25] kentor: i have a feeling that im mising something that has to do with the ports
[23:34:55] kentor: any ideas :)
[23:35:51] AutomatedTester: i dont really have an environment that is headless
[23:35:57] AutomatedTester: just checking it locallyu
[23:36:14] kentor: yea it seems there are few people who are using headless :(
[23:36:33] kentor: although this could be so useful so I dunno why more people aren't using it
[23:36:46] AutomatedTester: I like to see selenium working
[23:36:50] AutomatedTester: <- weird
[23:37:09] kentor: yea but with headless, you can run this every x mins
[23:37:13] kentor: somewhere on a remote box
[23:37:19] kentor: on ec2
[23:37:24] kentor: test for perf
[23:37:26] kentor: test for changes
[23:37:34] kentor: etc
[23:37:37] kentor: its all automated
[23:38:14] AutomatedTester: I run them remote too
[23:38:28] AutomatedTester: but with VMs that I can VNC into
[23:38:53] kentor: yea makes sense

[23:44:50] kentor: remove the profile and you'll get all the content
[23:45:08] kentor: just do browser = webdriver.Firefox()
[23:45:20] kentor: instead of browser = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile)
[23:45:25] AutomatedTester: but if you remove the profile you remove the proxy
[23:45:30] kentor: :)
[23:45:30] AutomatedTester: which is not what you want
[23:45:40] kentor: well then something is broken :)
[23:46:50] kentor: btw
[23:46:53] kentor: where are the bmp logs
[23:46:56] kentor: I cannot find them
