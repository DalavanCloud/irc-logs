[00:17:31] G-Mac: I've been working with Jim Evans on a patch for the PhantomJSDriverService for the .NET bindings.  He suggested that I submit the patch through git, and I don't see a clear path for submitting a patch/pull request with Google code.  Can someone point me in the right direction?
[00:19:50] stackedsax1: barancev: I think I'm close with the slf4j stuff.  I think, though, it's loading JUL earlier than Jetty
[00:19:56] stackedsax1: like mentioned here
[00:19:56] stackedsax1: http://jetty.4.n6.nabble.com/Usage-of-JUL-to-SLF4J-td4958903.html
[00:22:34] sayd: I think facebook just broke the internet
[00:23:15] sayd: anyone else noticing if youre logged in on facebook and go to any site with their js, you get redirected to a fb error page?
[00:30:59] dude-x: that's nutty
[00:31:35] jarib: G-Mac: you can attach the patch to an issue (see :newissue) or do a pull request against https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium

[00:36:34] G-Mac: Thanks jarib.
[00:40:21] AutomatedTester: right kids I should be curled up in bed
[00:41:02] KaibutsuX: hey not bad
[00:41:09] KaibutsuX: looks like it's not quite focused
[00:41:16] KaibutsuX: focusing sucks :)
[00:42:40] KaibutsuX: if I need to get the input element that a label references in it's "for" attribute, what would be the fastest way to accomplish that?
[00:43:00] dude-x: http://brython.info/index.html python in the browser
[00:43:20] KaibutsuX: right now I'm thinking xpath to get the label, then get_attribute to get the id, then get_element_by_id with that
[00:44:17] KaibutsuX: dude-x, that is sweet
[00:44:38] dude-x: it's basically a javascript file that can interpret python sytanx
[00:44:44] dude-x: it's wild

[02:32:52] stackedsax1: no matter what I do, slf4j doesn't work.  
[02:33:27] stackedsax1: I'm doing the ultra-simplest thing possible: adding the jars to the classpath.  But Selenium doesn't find them.
[02:33:40] stackedsax1: if you have any thoughts, would love to know
[02:33:51] itsmikerudolph: ruby - appending onto web driver error messages - anyone have thoughts on where to start?

[08:55:01] dukeatcoding: i mean you can simple put it out to console, you can use some maven plugins like Surfire

[10:11:53] *detronizator listening to yesterday's AutomatedTester rant

[10:41:59] Ardesco: :)
[10:42:46] Ardesco: dukeatcoding: there are possibly a million ways to create fancy reports to make managers poo and ah
[10:42:49] Ardesco: personally
[10:42:52] Ardesco: i don't bother
[10:42:57] Ardesco: they never get looked at
[10:43:04] Ardesco: I just make sure the tests keep passing
[10:43:05] Ardesco: :)
[10:43:22] Ardesco: I would suggest working out what info you want in your report
[10:43:27] Ardesco: and then making it look like that

[11:18:37] zac_sel: gwad why was that movie made?
[11:43:59] dukeatcoding: @Adresco my intention of asking is not really that i am creating a test
[11:44:03] dukeatcoding: i am creating a plattform
[11:44:19] dukeatcoding: for executing selenium tests written in different languages
[11:44:25] dukeatcoding: i am doing the next step of saucelabs
[11:44:35] dukeatcoding: no only giving the infrastructure
[11:44:49] dukeatcoding: but also providing the possible to upload code, execute it and retrieving the result
[11:44:54] dukeatcoding: for that reason i need to get an overview
[11:45:06] dukeatcoding: what kind fo reporting is widely spread
[11:47:33] samphippen has joined #selenium
[11:53:55] Ardesco: i would guess most people use standard junit/testng/ant/jenkins output
[11:54:31] dukeatcoding: after reading a while in docu and the google group
[11:54:35] dukeatcoding: i would guess the same
[11:54:45] dukeatcoding: jenkins is also an integrated build system
[11:54:55] dukeatcoding: it is "only" responsible for compile and executing things or not ?
[11:55:00] nemesi8s has joined #selenium
[11:55:03] dukeatcoding: so JUnit and TestNG and their plugins
[11:55:08] dukeatcoding: are responsible for the main reporting
[11:55:17] dukeatcoding: ant/jenkins/maven are for building and executing things
[11:55:34] dukeatcoding: like executing the test -> logfile -> executing reproting tool -> convert text to html, pdf something
[11:55:49] dukeatcoding: or i am i missing somehting ?
[11:56:08] nemesi8s: hi all
[11:56:37] Ardesco: i think ant has an option to add some polishing of output
[11:56:44] Ardesco: gradle can also polish testing output
[11:56:58] Ardesco: s/testing/testng/
[11:57:08] nemesi8s: does anybody has experience with ie + js autocomplete + selenium? :)
[11:57:45] dukeatcoding: jep gradle i got also on my list
[11:57:56] dukeatcoding: it seems that there is a specific reporting tool for each programming language
[11:58:12] dukeatcoding: and you might be right on the ant thing
[11:58:17] dukeatcoding: i found something for maven
[11:58:36] dukeatcoding: called surfire
[11:58:40] dukeatcoding: also enhancing the log output
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Feb  8 12:00:22 2013]
[12:00:22] Ardesco: tbh
[12:00:28] Ardesco: make up your own logs
[12:00:41] Ardesco: when people moan they aren't good enough add what they ask for
[12:00:55] dukeatcoding: maybe you are right
[12:00:58] dukeatcoding: the system i build is
[12:00:59] Ardesco: don't try and ad in all the reporting requirements aeverybody could ever want
[12:01:01] dukeatcoding: www.testchameleon.com
[12:01:17] dukeatcoding: and we want to integrate selenium testing
[12:01:20] dukeatcoding: maybe an approach like
[12:01:21] dukeatcoding: http://usetrace.com
[12:01:24] dukeatcoding: is a good way
[12:01:33] plightbo has joined #selenium
[12:02:02] Ardesco: jebus
[12:02:05] Ardesco: that's expensive
[12:02:12] dukeatcoding: we probably
[12:02:18] dukeatcoding: lower the prices don't know ;)
[12:02:23] dukeatcoding: i am only responsible for the technology
[12:03:18] Ardesco: that's way more expensive than backspace or AWS
[12:03:23] Ardesco: *rackspace
[12:03:31] dukeatcoding: you can't compare us with them
[12:03:37] dukeatcoding: our system is dedicated to software testing
[12:03:39] Ardesco: way more expensive than sauce
[12:03:39] dukeatcoding: so you say
[12:03:42] Ardesco: or testingbot
[12:03:44] dukeatcoding: OS x browser x flash
[12:03:49] dukeatcoding: start
[12:03:52] dukeatcoding: test for 3 minutes
[12:03:56] dukeatcoding: throw the system away
[12:03:58] dukeatcoding: get the next one
[12:04:17] dukeatcoding: sauce lab is cheaper but you can't have some much configurations as we have
[12:04:31] dukeatcoding: we have about 1200 possible combinations for system configurations
[12:05:09] Ardesco: the only difference i'm seeing so far is you have an option to configure flash
[12:05:50] dukeatcoding: flash is the main difference right now
[12:05:54] dukeatcoding: we are working on some things
[12:05:57] Ardesco: and the sauce package I currently have access to has unlimited manual minutes
[12:06:18] dukeatcoding: the thing is
[12:06:26] dukeatcoding: the simple keep a bunch of machines running
[12:06:28] dukeatcoding: all the time
[12:06:32] dukeatcoding: multiple people on the same machine
[12:06:41] dukeatcoding: you can only use the browser as far as i know
[12:06:50] dukeatcoding: we give you full remote access to a dedicated machine
[12:07:13] *Ardesco is wondering why I can't compare you to backspace or AWS then
[12:07:21] Ardesco: *rackspace
[12:07:25] Ardesco: stupid autocorrect
[12:07:30] dukeatcoding: hehe have to lookup backsupace though
[12:07:36] dukeatcoding: AWS give you cloud ressources ? am i wrong
[12:07:42] Ardesco: nope
[12:08:15] dukeatcoding: do you get also remote access lets say like RDP to a machine ?
[12:08:26] Ardesco: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/
[12:08:39] Ardesco: you get full access
[12:08:44] Ardesco: you build what you want on it
[12:09:08] dukeatcoding: do you get remote access to mac os machines ?
[12:09:15] dukeatcoding: only linux and win ?
[12:09:26] dukeatcoding: an like it seems only win server not win client
[12:09:32] dukeatcoding: yeah you might be able to compare
[12:09:40] dukeatcoding: but in the end its a whole different use case
[12:09:45] dukeatcoding: in our focus is software testing
[12:09:49] dukeatcoding: our main brand is
[12:09:51] dukeatcoding: www.testbirds.com
[12:13:32] dukeatcoding: did you take a look a
[12:13:33] dukeatcoding: http://usetrace.com
[12:13:37] dukeatcoding: looks very intersting
[12:16:59] Ardesco: sorry pulled away
[12:17:12] Ardesco: nope don't get access to OSX
[12:17:21] dukeatcoding: np
[12:17:37] dukeatcoding: so we have OSX 10.7 and 10.8 right now
[12:18:01] Ardesco: but if OSX is your only selling point
[12:18:09] Ardesco: i think you will struggle :)
[12:18:19] dukeatcoding: hehe
[12:18:25] dukeatcoding: probably you are right
[12:19:03] dukeatcoding: so we are currently working on new nice features
[12:19:12] dukeatcoding: first will be selenium integration in some way
[12:19:21] dukeatcoding: right now i have it so far
[12:19:28] dukeatcoding: that you can configure your systemconfigurations for your test
[12:19:35] dukeatcoding: the specified machines will boot up
[12:19:40] dukeatcoding: and you can start the test
[12:19:48] dukeatcoding: but now i want to go further with the nice reporting
[12:19:58] Ardesco: you lost my business at "machines will boot up"
[12:20:05] dukeatcoding: hehe
[12:20:14] eutheria has joined #selenium
[12:20:15] dukeatcoding: lets say you want to thest a web applcaition
[12:20:26] Ardesco: i want to just fire my tests at a grid
[12:20:32] Ardesco: i don't want to boot a machine
[12:20:35] Ardesco: attach it to a grid
[12:20:40] Ardesco: and then fire my tests at the grid
[12:20:41] dukeatcoding: in chrome 21 with flash 11.5 on win xp, vista, 7 32bit , 764bit, 8 32, 8 64, mac os 10.7, 10.9
[12:20:47] dukeatcoding: so you select this configrations on our plattform
[12:20:49] dukeatcoding: the will but
[12:20:50] dukeatcoding: boot
[12:20:54] dukeatcoding: connect themselves to the grid
[12:20:58] dukeatcoding: and you can start your test

[12:21:13] eutheria: Archdude, you want to pay for a test hosting service?
[12:21:27] eutheria: i think there is one

[12:21:56] dukeatcoding: you don't have to
[12:21:58] Ardesco: I'm at risk of firing my tests at the grid and there being no valid nodes
[12:22:01] dukeatcoding: right now you upload your test
[12:22:04] dukeatcoding: grid boots up
[12:22:06] dukeatcoding: when grid is ready
[12:22:13] dukeatcoding: your test will be executed automatically
[12:22:19] dukeatcoding: then grid shuts down
[12:22:26] dukeatcoding: only problem is the reporting part
[12:22:30] dukeatcoding: thats what i am working on
[12:22:44] Ardesco: so how are you going to be able to run my tesy
[12:22:59] dukeatcoding: i worked only on a prototype so far
[12:23:03] dukeatcoding: so i used a simple java test case
[12:23:06] Ardesco: how can i be sure you have all required jar's in the class path
[12:23:10] dukeatcoding: which i execute ...
[12:23:21] dukeatcoding: jep ;)
[12:23:23] Ardesco: do i have to make my test framework match your java framework
[12:23:28] dukeatcoding: one of the thinks i have to deal with
[12:23:56] Ardesco: you really want me to upload arbitrary code and just start running shit...
[12:24:09] dukeatcoding: that would be the far far far away thing
[12:24:10] Ardesco: you don't know what my code does...
[12:24:13] dukeatcoding: i honestly right now think
[12:24:17] dukeatcoding: i have to go more in the direct of http://usetrace.com
[12:24:24] dukeatcoding: and specifiy one or more languages
[12:24:30] dukeatcoding: where you directly write the code on the plattform
[12:24:37] dukeatcoding: to enshure that code and reporting works properly
[12:24:47] dukeatcoding: otherwise i will never be able to ensure that it is working
[12:24:51] dukeatcoding: other idea is
[12:24:57] dukeatcoding: to give you a dedicated machine
[12:25:02] dukeatcoding: in our system
[12:25:07] dukeatcoding: from which you start your test
[12:25:16] dukeatcoding: where you can setup your testing environment
[12:25:25] dukeatcoding: though i am not shure if that is a better solution
[12:26:36] Ardesco: the advantage sauce have got is that you can write your test in any way and you just fire your code to a grid
[12:26:44] dukeatcoding: jep
[12:26:46] dukeatcoding: i see that
[12:26:46] Ardesco: so any test code written in any way will work
[12:27:02] dukeatcoding: i am right, that they have a limited number of possible configurations ?
[12:27:06] dukeatcoding: their grid is up all the time
[12:27:10] dukeatcoding: with machines hosting some configurations
[12:27:20] dukeatcoding: as long as you only need them you are fine
[12:27:25] dukeatcoding: no special wishes
[12:27:33] Ardesco: https://saucelabs.com/docs/browsers
[12:27:35] dukeatcoding: and you have to bring your own build environment for the test
[12:28:00] Ardesco: what do you mean by own build environment
[12:28:20] dukeatcoding: you need to have a system with jenkins / maven something installed
[12:28:24] dukeatcoding: to run your code maybe
[12:28:25] Ardesco: i can fire tests from my local machine to sauce, or from CI to sauce, basically anywhere I can run my tests
[12:28:34] dukeatcoding: what chrome versions does saucelab support ?
[12:28:44] Ardesco: as long as I have a valid test that can run and be pointed at a grid i'm good
[12:28:57] Ardesco: ^^ look at the link
[12:28:57] dukeatcoding: we have clients right now
[12:29:02] dukeatcoding: in the link
[12:29:06] dukeatcoding: there is no versio number on
[12:29:09] dukeatcoding: chrome that why i am asking
[12:29:17] dukeatcoding: seems to me they offer a "random" version
[12:29:26] Ardesco: i believe it's latest
[12:29:32] Ardesco: but as chrome auto downloads updates
[12:29:37] Ardesco: not really a big deal IMHO
[12:29:44] dukeatcoding: you maybe right for most people not
[12:29:48] dukeatcoding: we have some client right now
[12:29:50] Ardesco: i'm sure there are edge cases where this is not true
[12:29:52] dukeatcoding: which want to test all chrome versions
[12:29:57] dukeatcoding: all Firefox version
[12:30:02] dukeatcoding: not only the main releases
[12:30:10] dukeatcoding: the want the highest compatablity available
[12:30:13] Ardesco: IMHO they are wasting their time
[12:30:17] dukeatcoding: hehe
[12:30:20] dukeatcoding: not my time my money
[12:30:21] dukeatcoding: ;)
[12:30:25] dukeatcoding: the setup the rulez
[12:30:27] Ardesco: mozilla doesn't support all firefox versions
[12:30:29] dukeatcoding: but i agree with you in most cases
[12:30:32] dukeatcoding: you might be right
[12:30:34] Ardesco: google doesn't support all browser versions
[12:30:39] dukeatcoding: that newest browsers re fine
[12:32:02] dukeatcoding: ;)
[12:32:16] dukeatcoding: my personal idea is ;)
[12:32:28] dukeatcoding: to create a "grid_class"
[12:32:37] dukeatcoding: for each programming languages
[12:32:43] dukeatcoding: which lets you specify the machines you want
[12:32:52] dukeatcoding: start them, and then executes rest of the selenium code
[12:33:01] dukeatcoding: so that the client execution will still remain on your machine

[13:03:01] millenium_: is it ok to make tests witch create some records then go to another and see are they connected - for example create default group then create few users which by default are added to this group and make some test with this group after that like move users to other groups, check existing of some buttons when select user, etc? for me this kind of tests look kind of hard to implement with selenium?

[15:18:17] AutomatedTester: not at jimevans though
[15:18:19] AutomatedTester: he is lovely
[15:18:33] garndt: jimevans: with 2.29, should elements scroll into view in the viewport when interacted with or should it throw an exception now that it's not in the viewport?
[15:18:52] garndt: I didn't see any issues open currently, unless I didn't look correctly
[15:19:37] jimevans: garndt: depends on the element. there are certain (rare?) instances where we might throw an exception, but in the main should be scrolling into view. do you have a repro case?
[15:20:02] *Ardesco shakes his fist backâ€¦
[15:21:04] garndt: I can reproduce it consistently in an internal app I'm testing.  I certainly could try to build some html file to test against if needed.  It's a form button that is at the bottom of the page that is not currently visible in the viewport
[15:21:27] garndt: worked in 2.26, updated to 2.29 and now I am getting that exception when attempting to click it.
[15:22:42] jimevans: garndt: is this 2.29 of the IEDriverServer.exe? 2.29.0, 2.29.1, or an interim release pulled directly from the prebuilt directory in the source tree?
[15:23:35] jimevans: and, yeah, this is the kind of thing that's going to need a test page.
[15:24:00] garndt: 2.29.1 from the selenium downloads page
[15:24:34] jimevans: garndt: try 2.29.0. i think i may know where things changed.
[15:28:13] simonstewart: g;day jimevans 
[15:35:34] garndt: jimevans: sure, I'll try that.  Is there somewhere that I can download the previous prebuilt packages?
[15:36:33] jimevans: go to the downloads page, change the "search" drop down from "current downloads" to "all downloads" and just hit the search button. 
[15:36:50] garndt: Sorry for the dumb question.  Thanks.

[16:47:06] lukeis: jimevans: do you think it possible to build the IE Driver with MinGW? or will do i *really* need Visual Studio? (Which I don't have nor will I likely get)
[16:47:14] jimevans: Ardesco: the biggest issue for me is that they're not wrong. the IE driver is shit, perf-wise.

[18:28:10] supercom32: Is there a way in Selenium to get the absolute position of a webElement on screen? Or this not possible?

[18:30:18] JackDandy has joined #selenium
[18:30:36] supercom32: @barancev: Ah. Ok, thanks for the heads up.
[18:31:18] garndt: jimevans: I've been playing with the ElementNotVisibleException that I mentioned earlier and the only thing I can come up with is that it's related to click().  If I send the enter key to the button web element, it works correctly, but when I use click() it only scrolls to the element and throws the exception. I also noticed that if the element is a
[18:31:18] garndt: checkbox, it will scroll to it but not click it and not throw an exception.   I tried saving the file locally so I could have something to give you but the issue wasn't reproducible then.  I'm not sure what's going on.
[18:31:40] garndt: it is not only on that page either.  Other pages where the button is out of the viewport it throws the exception.  I can try to isolate it more.
[18:31:50] jimevans: did you try it with 2.29.0?
[18:31:53] garndt: yes
[18:31:59] lukeis: barancev: it's not? can't you get driver.window().location() and then element.location()  (and then guess how large the browser chrome is) ?
[18:32:06] jimevans: same problem?
[18:32:39] jimevans: garndt: ^^
[18:33:14] jimevans: (and i meant IEDriverServer.exe 2.29.0, if that wasn't clear)
[18:34:20] *jimevans needs a sauce account
[18:34:31] barancev: lukeis: you can calculate it
[18:34:53] lukeis: jimevans: which kind? Selenium's sauce account, or an SFDC one?
[18:34:54] barancev: but element.getCoordinates().onPage() throws UnsupportedOperationException
[18:35:07] barancev: s/onPage/onScreen/
[18:35:47] garndt: jimevans: I'm not intentionally ignoring your question, was just double checking something before I say I was sure I tested on 2.29.0.  One sec. (and yes, it was clear you meant 2.29.0 of IEDriverServer.exe)
[18:35:57] lukeis: okâ€¦ supercom32 ^ you follow that? :) the direct method (in one shot) is not supported, but you can calculate it with a few calls
[18:36:28] jimevans: lukeis: don't care. i need to find out something about configuration of the IE10 instances used for our CI build 
[18:36:39] supercom32: The current solution I have which isn't perfect is to get the window position, then get the web element's position. And if it's in an iFrame, recursively calculate the size of each container until your at the root.
[18:36:41] garndt: jimevans: same thing on 2.29.0
[18:36:54] garndt: sending the enter key works, click does not
[18:36:58] supercom32: And then factor in the chrome.
[18:37:36] jimevans: garndt: that means i didn't break it in 2.29.0.3 (which is what i thought i did)
[18:37:53] garndt: jimevans: oh, well good :)

[20:51:51] lukeis: well, there's DOM events that you could look forâ€¦ your google searching should be 'how do i determine file loaded with javascript' or similarâ€¦ because you'll need to use driver.execute_script to check the page

[21:13:30] jimevans: could really use a consult from jarib.
[21:13:39] runnyspot: is anyone experiencing issues with sauce currently?
[21:13:55] runnyspot: i can't even pull up google in manual testing session
[21:13:58] jarib: jimevans: what's up?
[21:15:02] jimevans: jarib: is there any reason why the ruby bindings would be starting the IE driver with native events turned off by default?
[21:15:31] jarib: don't think so
[21:15:33] *jarib looks
[21:16:00] AutomatedTester: that thing were you replicate a bug with all the moving parts
[21:16:07] AutomatedTester: but when in an atom test you cant
[21:16:33] nirvdrum: Does anyone have all the tests passing in linux?
[21:17:06] nirvdrum: I assume CI is linux.
[21:17:30] AutomatedTester: the CI is different platforms
[21:17:34] AutomatedTester: :ci
[21:17:34] selbot2: Jenkins: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/ | Dashboard: http://dashboard.ci.seleniumhq.org/
[21:17:56] nirvdrum: Well, yes.  I assumed you couldn't run IE on linux.  I meant the host.
[21:18:03] jarib: jimevans: don't see anything that would indicate that. 
[21:18:11] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: you would assume that
[21:18:31] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I will fight you.
[21:18:46] AutomatedTester: and I will cuddle you...
[21:18:47] AutomatedTester: :D
[21:19:00] nirvdrum: Are we back on you picturing me naked?
[21:19:12] jarib: jimevans: if it's a user having trouble, ask them to run with `$DEBUG = true` to get a wire dump.. you'll see the capabilities used
[21:19:15] AutomatedTester: zomg yes!
[21:19:29] jimevans: jarib: itsmikerudolph seems to be experiencing that. he says he's getting native events = false when launching IE
[21:19:39] jimevans: itsmikerudolph: ^^
[21:19:59] regex__: How do ou change the coordinate or position at which the .click method clicks?
[21:20:04] smccarthy has joined #selenium
[21:20:07] regex__: and or wait until visible?
[21:20:46] jimevans: regex__: if you're using .Click(), that's a convenience method. it will always click at the center of the element. if you need more control than that, use the Actions class.
[21:22:16] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I'm having, and have been having, troubles with the FF atoms tests: https://gist.github.com/nirvdrum/4742052
[21:22:19] nirvdrum: Any ideas?
[21:22:30] regex__: jimevans:  Element is not clickable at point (690.5, 490)
[21:22:59] jimevans: regex_: well, then the element is likely not clickable at that point. :)
[21:24:03] jimevans: or rather, that point on the element isn't in the view port, and can't be scrolled to become so (at least not by the element.scrollIntoView() JavaScript function)
[21:24:05] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: whats the ./go build target?
[21:24:33] jimevans: this is often the case when you have a really large element, and a really small browser window.
[21:24:48] jimevans: but again, if you need finer control, use the Actions class.
[21:24:52] nirvdrum: Just "./go"  I was trying to get a clean build through-and-through.  But it's failing at //javascript/atoms:test_ff
[21:25:01] regex__: I'm trying to close a window.  The other button that closes it gives me: element must be displayed to click
[21:25:03] regex__: Even though it is
[21:26:05] jimevans: regex__: you may not have the element you think you have. or the visibility checking algorithm may be mistaken about this particular element.
[21:27:39] regex__: jimevans: I might just take the easy route and choose the escape send key
[21:29:12] jimevans: :kittens

[22:04:45] lukeis: nirvdrum: the change logs are linked from the downloads pageâ€¦ and also :changelog

[22:05:50] nirvdrum: lukeis: I'm open to being wrong, but where is the changelog on this page?  https://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list
[22:06:14] lukeis: the sehq :download page :)
[22:06:18] lukeis: :downloads
[22:06:18] selbot2: http://seleniumhq.org/download/ and https://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list
[22:06:55] lukeis: of course you need to go to www or docs right nowâ€¦ since 'seleniumhq.org' is old
[22:08:20] nirvdrum: lukeis: Ahh.  That is much better.  I don't think I've ever seen that link before.
[22:08:35] nirvdrum: It still kinda blows that I need to look at several files to get an idea of what's changed.
[22:08:58] nirvdrum: I'm sure the argument is IEDriverServer can release at its own pace.  But in reality, I think most people upgrade at the same time.
[22:10:30] lukeis: to that point IEDriverServer has released at it's own pace, but jim also likes to cut a release during normal Se releases too
[22:13:57] nirvdrum: I don't see why that couldn't be under a "Selenium Changelog" though.
[22:14:45] lukeis: it could beâ€¦ change logs are always a pain to write ;)
[22:14:57] *lukeis knows someone who also has the commit bit
[22:15:04] nirvdrum: They really aren't.
[22:15:17] nirvdrum: Most of my complaints are solved easily technically.
[22:15:31] lukeis: every time i've had to do them for this project i find them to beâ€¦ 
[22:15:50] nirvdrum: You just update a text file when you make a notable change . . .
[22:16:06] lukeis: heh, tell that to everybody ;)
[22:16:10] nirvdrum: Clearly people are doing that already :-P
[22:16:19] lukeis: not all the time
[22:16:28] lukeis: some more discipline than others...
[22:16:38] nirvdrum: lukeis: So, I could go in and reorganize the changelog.  But I don't really have the energy for the fighting it'll cause.
[22:16:40] lukeis: i forget to all the time :)
[22:16:46] nirvdrum: So, easier to vent here and have people call me lazy.
[22:16:56] lukeis: you's be lazy ;)
[22:17:25] lukeis: of course i'm lazierâ€¦ 
[22:17:32] nirvdrum: lukeis: In the Ruby world, almost no one maintains a changelog because it's "too hard."  When you start thinking about your project in terms of more than just code, it becomes second nature.
[22:18:08] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Does that mean you were able to reproduce?
[22:18:35] nirvdrum: lukeis: Long story short, I content user-facing docs like changelogs should optimize for the user, not the dev.

[22:20:24] nirvdrum: lukeis: And this speaks to a larger concern I have that the project is just too onerous now with so many disparate downloads.  But that's an argument I lost long ago.
[22:21:06] lukeis: it will only get worse in the future :) each browser to have it's own download
[22:21:15] lukeis: then + selenium
[22:21:24] lukeis: well, i guess FF won't have one
[22:21:30] lukeis: maybe...
[22:21:41] nirvdrum: Yeah.
[22:21:44] nirvdrum: That sucks.
[22:22:13] nirvdrum: As it is, I have to keep googling for the chromedriver, only to have the top search result be wrong :-/

[22:23:37] nirvdrum: I'd hazard to say most don't know the bot commands.
[22:23:50] nirvdrum: So, the average selenium user is likely to use a search engine.
[22:23:54] nirvdrum: And the top result is wrong.
[22:23:56] lukeis: yes
[22:24:04] lukeis: it is linked on the downloads page
[22:25:08] lukeis: top 3 links for me were good thoughâ€¦ (our wiki page was first, it has a link to the downloadâ€¦ granted it's half way down the page)
[22:27:25] nirvdrum: But then you lose the changelog.
[22:27:29] nirvdrum: Oh well.

[22:40:30] AutomatedTester: dale: no difference
[22:40:53] andreastt: dale: Don't think there's much of a difference; it all boils down to a remote connection to Firefox.
[22:41:04] andreastt: Uh, yeah.
[22:42:01] jleyba: andreastt: The link is added by Closure's test library.
[22:42:38] jleyba: Our tests define the DOM structure in the test HTML page and expect it to be in a certain state. We rarely clean up in tearDown
[22:42:49] jleyba: So if you click the run again button, the DOM won't be in the right state.  Refresh should always work
