[00:44:08] ha6aha6a: hello. i am using webdriver. i have to go through a bunch of elements that have the same class name. But i only get the first one. how can i make the code move passt that and get the next element with the same class name?
[00:48:17] jost: ha6aha6a, use "driver.findElements" instead of "driver.findElement"
[00:51:31] ha6aha6a: jost that is what i am doing but then i get a List and i can't get the info out of a List and not a List of WebElements but a List of Objects. i tried to use List.get(0) to get th first 
[00:51:52] ha6aha6a: jost: don't read the text after the last period
[00:52:55] jost: Thats weird... can you show your code?
[00:53:38] ha6aha6a: can i show two lines of code here?
[00:54:01] jost: I suppose
[00:54:21] ha6aha6a: List webElements = new ArrayList();
[00:54:32] ha6aha6a: webElements =  driver.findElements(By.className("prod_grid"));
[00:54:46] ha6aha6a: i guess this looks ok so far
[00:55:28] jost: Try List<WebElement> webElements = driver.findElements(...);
[00:55:54] jost: Your list has no element type given, and thus defaults to List<Object>.
[00:59:25] ha6aha6a: jost: that solved it. thank you very much :-)
[00:59:44] jost: np :-)

[10:32:32] AutomatedTester: maybe I am just hitting every webkit backwardness but every time I try implement something it works well in everything but webkit
[10:33:12] Osleg: AutomatedTester: you are so right -_-
[10:33:24] AutomatedTester: WebKit is the new IE
[10:33:36] Osleg: was rtying to use webkit for automatization -> it newer works as expected
[10:33:47] Osleg: s/rtying/trying
[10:34:20] annette has left #selenium
[10:34:56] bobsapp: are you talking about chome webkit? from experience safari's webkit supports the most things.
[10:35:08] Osleg: chrome does too
[10:35:19] Osleg: but the way it supports is so awkward
[10:35:51] bobsapp: its even worse on android
[10:36:09] simonstewart: OK. Just tweaked the DNS settings to make "www.seleniumhq.org" direct to "docs.seleniumhq.org"
[10:36:12] simonstewart: Let's see if this works
[10:36:24] bobsapp: getting better though with JB since the default browser on anything past jellybean is chrome.
[10:37:42] p_l: bobsapp: only on nexus devices, and those without custom rom
[10:38:00] p_l: (a common custom mod is bringing Browser.apk back)
[10:38:23] bobsapp: p_l: exactly :) 2.3 is still like 40%+ of the ecosystem
[10:38:38] bobsapp: why would you want to bring back the old browser?
[10:39:48] dawagner: simonstewart: Using a temporary redirect, not a perm, right?
[10:39:57] simonstewart: DNS CNAME
[10:40:06] p_l: bobsapp: because it supports Flash
[10:40:07] simonstewart: With a TTL of 5 minutes
[10:40:16] dawagner: Cool :)
[10:40:31] p_l: bobsapp: also, in tablet version it had a bit nicer UI than Chrome (the pie-menu :3)
[10:40:32] rananda has joined #selenium
[10:40:35] Osleg: also chrome is kinda buggy
[10:40:41] Osleg: chrome for mobile i mean
[10:40:50] Osleg: it crashes alot and works really slow
[10:40:57] Osleg: on tegra3 device with 2gb ram
[10:41:19] bobsapp: well i suppose there is no down side as long as the interal browser for rendering html is still chrome.

[12:03:17] bobsapp: millenium: I think it removes the checkbox from the dom if you do that
[12:03:19] bobsapp: in firefox
[12:04:47] millenium: bobsapp yes I don't see it in the innerHtml but still is visable on the browser :?
[12:05:23] bobsapp: true
[12:05:35] millenium: so is there a way to be tested
[12:05:39] bobsapp: actually it is still in the dom
[12:05:43] millenium: it should I think
[12:05:53] bobsapp: maybe execute some javascript to get the value?
[12:06:27] bobsapp: try in this with firebug: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_checkbox_disabled
[12:07:09] bobsapp: document.getElementById("cats").checked
[12:07:18] bobsapp: dunno if you want it to be cross browser thoug

[13:40:56] barancev: jimevans: g'day! have I already asked you why IEDriver uses IEDocument2::get_cookie but not InternetGetCookieEx?
[13:41:12] llaskin has joined #selenium
[13:43:27] jimevans: barancev: what would you expect to pass in as the lpszURL parameter?
[13:44:06] jimevans: also, InternetGetCookieEx can only retrieve one cookie at a time.
[13:44:30] barancev: jimevans: something like document->window->url
[13:45:20] jimevans: what would you expect to gain by using InternetGetCookieEx that you don't get from get_cookie()?
[13:45:47] vila has joined #selenium
[13:46:05] davehunt has joined #selenium
[13:46:18] barancev: jimevans: and if  lpszCookieName == NULL it should return all cookies
[13:46:38] barancev: jimevans: we can get HttpOnly cookies that get_cookies does not return
[13:46:39] jimevans: barancev: it's not documented that way.
[13:46:45] barancev: and I need them
[13:48:40] barancev: jimevans: it is not documented in MSDN but there are samples in the Net that claims this is true
[13:49:28] barancev: jimevans: and, btw a coment to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384714(v=vs.85).aspx claims this too
[13:50:33] *jimevans apologizes to everyone in advance. he's very cranky today thanks to a very long weekend.
[13:51:02] jimevans: i suppose other browser drivers retrieve http-only cookies?
[13:51:04] barancev: I've yet checked this myself, I thought may be you know something bad about InternetGetCookieEx  and/or IEGetProtectedModeCookie (that can also take INTERNET_COOKIE_HTTPONLY yet this is not documented)
[13:51:17] barancev: jimevans: other browsers return all cookies, yes
[13:51:23] barancev: al least FF and Chrome
[13:51:30] barancev: not sure about Opera

[13:51:56] barancev: s/checked/not checked/
[13:52:51] barancev: jimevans: an example of "enchanced" get_cookie impementation, just found -- http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-cvs/2009-December/062156.html
[13:53:51] jimevans: that'd be the wine implementation, which may, in fact be exactly what get_cookie does.
[13:54:29] barancev: jimevans: atm IEDriver does not return HttpOnly cookies
[13:55:15] jeichar has joined #selenium
[13:55:17] jimevans: barancev: neither would the "enhanced" get_cookie implementation you pointed to.
[13:56:10] barancev: jimevans: yes, because it does not pass INTERNET_COOKIE_HTTPONLY flag, but I' prefer it to be passed

[14:09:59] jimevans: barancev: does InternetGetCookieEx return session cookies? it might not.
[14:10:40] OscarZ_: Michael_Wowro: the contents might be same as before in some cases...

[15:31:37] Michael_Wowro: do you mean something like that: http://assertselenium.com/2012/12/20/highlight-webelements-using-selenium-webdriver/
[15:33:23] millenium: ok lets try it...
[15:35:45] millenium: well... how can get the element on which my mouce is over it? :)
[15:35:48] millenium: *mouse
[15:40:27] millenium: there are two table headers and when I hover the mouse between them one div pop up in the end of the table which is re-sizer of the headers
[15:41:15] millenium: I want to hover between this two div then select the resizing div and resize one of the headers
[15:42:21] KaibutsuX: millenium: ActionsClass
[15:42:52] millenium: yep, .MoveToElement(tableColumHeaders[1], -9 , 5)
[15:43:03] millenium: and still the resizing div dont popup
[15:43:56] millenium: something is wrong of the positioning of this headers :? too much javascript in this grid
[15:44:41] KaibutsuX: anyone know how to do the following in Python: load a source file which has no imports, but edit it to use an import that is present in the parent?

[21:28:53] santiycr: awesome, glad my fix solved the problem
[21:28:54] santiycr: :)
[21:29:14] *santiycr looking at the job you sent

[21:38:04] jimevans: indeed i do.
[21:38:22] AutomatedTester: jimevans: see he is a good guy :)
[21:38:42] jimevans: most people are. it's just getting them motivated to do what i want.
[21:38:46] jimevans: :)
[21:39:12] lukeis: obviously you're not talking about me ;)
[21:40:01] jimevans: lukeis: you're a good guy too. i just haven't wanted anything from you yet. :)
[21:40:43] AutomatedTester: jimevans: didnt you want his pickup?
[21:40:52] AutomatedTester: or was that the other luke ?
[21:41:36] AutomatedTester: right kids...
[21:41:38] AutomatedTester: I am off
[21:42:09] santiycr: barancev:  that new error message is kind of my fault. I'm investigating, but I think it means: "Selenium server never started
[21:42:57] santiycr: Confirmed, the Selenium jar never started listening

[21:53:26] barancev: santiycr: and an enhancement request: we'd like to run IEDriverServer with increased log level and get access to the log file, to debug issues like this one: https://saucelabs.com/tests/34a659a199a345d08cd1fcd99de89b52
[21:56:01] santiycr: barancev:  first job (9320ed..) looks like an operadriver bug
[21:56:59] santiycr: the second one is a WTF, shouldn't have failed to download the Se jar
[21:57:47] santiycr: we'll look into this soon, our temp storage infrastructure is about to go under a big overhaul
[21:58:07] santiycr: with a backup box and fail-proof 
[21:58:27] santiycr: if you can ignore those issues for now, we'll definitely invesitgate them if they are still around after that
[21:58:51] santiycr: regarding IEDriver support for improved logging, that's something I was already planning to do
[21:59:02] santiycr: been pinging jimevans for some details and have plans to put it in as new caps
[21:59:25] santiycr: like ie.log.file and ie.log.level
[21:59:39] santiycr: barancev:  did I thank you already for being an awesome monitor of our builds??

[22:00:18] santiycr: thanks
[22:03:35] barancev: thank you for the great system, I have lots of interesting things to watch :)
[22:03:45] barancev: and here it's again
[22:04:06] barancev: Couldn't establish TCP connection == server can't start. why?
[22:04:49] fatguylaughing has joined #selenium
[22:08:05] santiycr: barancev:  could be our fault as well, we've changed that code fairly recently 
[22:09:08] santiycr: barancev:  does it happen only in a specific type of test?
[22:15:37] barancev: santiycr: I can't see any specific test ot a test group, looks quite random

[22:29:23] kentor: can someone please help me with this: http://pastebin.com/LxBRArxW
[22:29:28] barancev: jimevans: I've added several new tests to CoordinatesTest, they fail in IE -- when IE calculates coordinates of an element in an iframe it ignores iframe border width, if you know where to fix this please do
[22:29:40] kentor: I am not able to run the most basic selenium Example
[22:32:40] barancev: kentor: Could not find the main class: Example -- where is the file Example.class in your directory tree?
[22:32:49] kentor: right there
[22:33:23] barancev: it should be in org/openqa/selenium/example according to your package declaration
[22:33:26] kentor: after javac, it gets created
[22:33:26] kentor: [sgalkov@zpub-web-203 selenium-2.29.0]$ ls CHANGELOG  Example.class  Example.java  libs  selenium-server-2.29.0.jar  selenium-server-2.29.0-srcs.jar  selenium-server-standalone-2.29.0.jar
[22:33:45] barancev: either move the file, or chane to package declaration
[22:34:07] barancev: s/chane to/change the/
[22:34:21] kentor: just import "example" 
[22:34:23] kentor: ?
[22:34:27] kentor: since its the same directory?
[22:35:09] kentor: i guess i don't need it
[22:35:10] barancev: if you want it to be in the current dir just remove the package declaration al all
[22:35:16] kentor: yes great
[22:35:24] kentor: im doing this on a headless machine and it is confusing
[22:35:51] kentor: ok thank you very much, it is working now
[22:35:57] kentor: let me try to get the proxy working now
