[2013-06-27 00:40:58] millenium: Hi, I'm sorry for the dummy question, but what are the pluses of standard IEserver, ChromeServer than selenium-standalone-server and RemoteWebDriver
[2013-06-27 00:43:13] Ardesco: you don't need a standalone selenium server unless you are using Selenium RC (Which is deprecated so you shouldn't be using it)
[2013-06-27 00:43:25] Ardesco: you need to use the IEDriverServer.exe to control IE
[2013-06-27 00:43:36] Ardesco: and you need to use the chromedriver binary to control chrome
[2013-06-27 00:44:06] Ardesco: remotewebdriver allows you to connect to a grid so that you can fire tests off against grid nodes
[2013-06-27 00:44:27] Ardesco: those nodes can be any browser, but if IE they need to use the IEDriverServer.exe and if chrome they need to use the chromedriver binary
[2013-06-27 00:44:48] Ardesco: hopefully that's clear :)
[2013-06-27 00:45:32] millenium: so the standalone-server communicate 02make the connection between the IEDriverServer.exe01 and the the remote webdriver in tests
[2013-06-27 00:47:00] manoj9788: Java Bindings of WebDriver is bundled with the Standalone server and that's why... some times.. you see people.. only use the Standalone server and not the Java Client libraries..
[2013-06-27 00:47:27] millenium: I just sow one test which I run on remotewebdriver with IE capabilities and it take the same time as Chrome (before it was almost two times more slow)02
[2013-06-27 00:47:27] manoj9788: But for other Language bindings... the client libraries.. are necessary.

[2013-06-27 00:48:54] millenium: we write our tests on .Net + SpecFlow
[2013-06-27 00:49:24] davidlai, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-27 00:49:58] millenium: till now we use the binaries *driver.exe and now we "migrate" to remotewebdriver and grid (i hope) we are still fresh in Selenium :)
[2013-06-27 00:50:48] manoj9788: Heard specFlow is a good one.. for BBD stlye in .NET
[2013-06-27 00:52:55] millenium: yes, I start a project on nUnit but after a month we realize that SpecFlow is our testing tool for Selenium unfortunately we don't use PageObject, but services for each module
[2013-06-27 00:53:34] millenium: so, are there pluses and minuses between the stand alone server and binaries :?
[2013-06-27 00:54:07] Ardesco: what do you mean by standalone-server
[2013-06-27 00:54:17] Ardesco: you shouldn't need to start a standalone server any more
[2013-06-27 00:54:23] Ardesco: web driver should deal with that for you
[2013-06-27 00:55:07] Ardesco: if the iEDriverServer.exe and the chromedriver binaries are in the system path it should be able to deal with those without you doing any extra as well

[2013-06-27 00:57:10] millenium: is it the same :?

[2013-06-27 01:27:09] sometesterdude: anyone can help?
[2013-06-27 01:27:15] andreastt: sometesterdude: :ask
[2013-06-27 01:27:15] selbot2_: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[2013-06-27 01:28:11] sometesterdude: looking help with nosetests, especially parallelizing
[2013-06-27 01:28:49] sometesterdude: for some reason, my test's don't run in parrallel even with running norestests --processes
[2013-06-27 01:29:37] stackedsax1, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2013-06-27 01:30:37] andreastt: Well presumably you need to make sure that you have multiple browser processes.
[2013-06-27 01:30:55] andreastt: So whenever your test uses a driver instance, you should make sure it comes from a pool of available drivers or something.
[2013-06-27 01:31:06] sometesterdude: hmm
[2013-06-27 01:31:28] sometesterdude: thing is, i can run in parralell when using unittest.Testcase
[2013-06-27 01:31:33] sometesterdude: but without it i can't
[2013-06-27 01:31:48] sometesterdude: since generators won't work with unittest
[2013-06-27 01:31:59] andreastt: I think unittest doesn't use multiprocessing to achieve parallelization.
[2013-06-27 01:32:17] sometesterdude: yes that's why i'm not using inittest
[2013-06-27 01:32:29] sometesterdude: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/02dc853944afc7de68a5
[2013-06-27 01:34:46] andreastt: Yes, so the problem here is the global driver.
[2013-06-27 01:35:23] andreastt: That needs to be serialized across the processes to be accessible.  So there's also only one driver ever available by the looks of it.
[2013-06-27 01:35:37] sometesterdude: ugh
[2013-06-27 01:35:44] sometesterdude: do you know how to do it?
[2013-06-27 01:36:10] andreastt: I've ever really only done this in Java, but I imagine you'd need a function to return you an available driver.
[2013-06-27 01:36:33] andreastt: In Java I'd use something like ThreadLocal, and then spin up the number of threads I wanted.
[2013-06-27 01:36:38] andreastt: But I haven't really done this in Python before (-:
[2013-06-27 01:36:53] sometesterdude: oh threadlocal
[2013-06-27 01:37:07] sometesterdude: in python threads are not that fancy as in Java

[2013-06-27 06:12:25] Panuchka: Hi! I have a bit strange problem with HtmlUnitDriver. When user clicks a link, it submits the information to server and goes to /create momentarily. Then in a flash it redirects the user to other place. Then it is supposed to look for h2 and print the insides of that to the log. It however can't find the h2 with any possible ways, or other elements I have tested IN THIS PAGE. Funny thing is that Firefox WebDriver works fine...
[2013-06-27 06:13:30] Panuchka: I'm running Windows 7 and the Java Selenium. The test was not written by me originally and I think it has worked before in Ubuntu.
[2013-06-27 06:13:39] SamuraiJack: llaskin: not really, just from command line, using rhino
[2013-06-27 06:14:08] llaskin: Panuchka: are you waiting for the h2?
[2013-06-27 06:14:16] llaskin: or for the "other place" to load?
[2013-06-27 06:14:39] Panuchka: I've tried some methods but I'm a total Selenium noob :)

[2013-06-27 06:49:02] nicegraham: I was wondering what people were doing, running a single instance of BMP or one per node
[2013-06-27 06:49:20] nicegraham: and if the latter, how do you specify it as part of init the session?
[2013-06-27 06:49:34] cmcgraw, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-27 06:49:42] davehunt: we aren't quite set up to run it at all yet, but it will be one server per test job, and one proxy per test
[2013-06-27 06:50:21] davehunt: we will likely the server centrally though, not on the remote nodes running the browser instances
[2013-06-27 06:50:26] Guest86920, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2013-06-27 06:50:40] davehunt: we will likely *run* the servers...
[2013-06-27 06:51:21] nicegraham: so how will you decide which proxy to use per test?
[2013-06-27 06:51:48] ryanpetrello, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-06-27 06:51:50] davehunt: the test framework will be responsible for requesting a proxy from the server
[2013-06-27 06:52:17] nicegraham: ok, so you don't care about the proxy's location relative to the browser session I guess?
[2013-06-27 06:52:19] davehunt: the servers will also be launched by the test harness
[2013-06-27 06:52:22] ryanpetrello, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-27 06:52:46] nicegraham: so will you be using grid at all?
[2013-06-27 06:53:11] davehunt: yes, we're using grid, but that doesn't really make a difference
[2013-06-27 06:53:32] davehunt: you can just treat that as a remote server
[2013-06-27 06:54:01] davehunt: as long as the browser instances you launch have the address of the proxy, and can reach that proxy, you're all good
[2013-06-27 06:54:15] davehunt: I released pytest-browsermobproxy which takes care of launching the servers/proxies for pytest
[2013-06-27 06:54:30] davehunt: but I'm likely to revisit that at some point and change the way it works
[2013-06-27 06:54:42] davehunt: this is a low priority project for me though, sadly
[2013-06-27 06:54:58] nicegraham: no worries, I was just looking for approaches
[2013-06-27 06:55:02] Panuchka: llaskin: Tried it but recieved same error: Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: Unable to locate element with name: h2
[2013-06-27 06:55:27] nicegraham: I was hung up on having the proxy close to the browser so that a har output would be as close to the browser as possible
[2013-06-27 06:55:45] nicegraham: I'm actually wondering about the validity on that concern
[2013-06-27 06:55:53] Panuchka: llaskin: Before that is the usual: syntax error (script in URL/quiz from (17, 36) to (37, 14)#19)
[2013-06-27 06:55:58] davehunt: you're concerned about adding network latency?
[2013-06-27 06:56:03] nicegraham: yeah
[2013-06-27 06:56:14] nicegraham: but really, the har is correct fo a machine
[2013-06-27 06:56:20] stan, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-06-27 06:56:32] davehunt: I think that's potentially valid, but it depends if you want to meet performance criteria or to detect regressions
[2013-06-27 06:56:39] nicegraham: the fact that it's not the browser machine probably isn't too important
[2013-06-27 06:57:08] Panuchka: It really bothers me that this has probably worked in Ubuntu, so perhaps it's something OS specific horriblesness
[2013-06-27 06:57:12] llaskin: Panuchka: sorry I need more info i guess
[2013-06-27 06:57:28] manoj9788: Yeah  llaskin:

[2013-06-27 06:58:15] nicegraham: chrome, ff, ie
[2013-06-27 06:58:46] davehunt: nicegraham: so you won't be able to set up a proxy in IE, afaik

[2013-06-27 07:01:57] davehunt: and maybe ultimately we will generate reports from the HAR files

[2013-06-27 07:04:11] manoj9788: davehunt: Really..? the HAR
[2013-06-27 07:04:12] Oscar1: you can get har exported from firefox using firebug and netexport
[2013-06-27 07:04:12] nicegraham: albeit not in a readily consumable manner
[2013-06-27 07:04:23] davehunt: manoj9788: a rumour of a rumour :)
[2013-06-27 07:04:26] manoj9788: there wll be no need.. for BMP then
[2013-06-27 07:04:33] manoj9788: davehunt: lol...
[2013-06-27 07:04:37] Oscar1: or you can just run some fancy javascript and get the raw json and get the data you want yourself
[2013-06-27 07:04:40] llaskin: and this works in ff but not in chrome?
[2013-06-27 07:05:29] Oscar1: you can just do something like
[2013-06-27 07:05:30] Oscar1: driver.execute_script("return window.performance || window.webkitPerformance || window.mozPerformance || window.msPerformance;")
[2013-06-27 07:05:42] Oscar1: you get all the same info back just as json
[2013-06-27 07:05:50] davehunt: manoj9788: BMP would still be needed for basic authentication, and use use cases

[2013-06-27 07:10:06] manoj9788: AutomatedTester: I think there is a new one about W3C
[2013-06-27 07:10:08] Oscar1: with firefox you can use firebug + netexport to get the har files, chrome has Devtools that will save the har as well
[2013-06-27 07:10:14] Dave_B_: Panuchka: Rats, there goes my idea :(
[2013-06-27 07:10:21] Panuchka: But there's a redirect after the click
[2013-06-27 07:10:22] Oscar1: never tried to save a har from chrome in code tho

[2013-06-27 08:36:38] Dave_B_: if you can work out how to tell then you can write code using webdriver that can tell

[2013-06-27 08:39:00] Dave_B_: I know it sounds obvious, but most of the time if you can say how you can do or check something then you already have the key to doing it automatically :) the reverse also being true, if you can't manually do something then its likely to be a bit annoying to automate
[2013-06-27 08:39:02] peshom: So theoretically, I can have the webdriver periodically check the page the browser is on and if it is on a page where there is activity programmed, it can be executed?
[2013-06-27 08:39:51] Dave_B_: umm. I guess? I'm slightly confused as to what you're aiming to do
[2013-06-27 08:41:01] Bebe_, quitting. (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[2013-06-27 08:41:03] Dave_B_: generally I already know what page my tests should be on, I may check I really am there though
[2013-06-27 08:41:37] peshom: My project is to automate auto insurance quoting and I need it to work on different websites and the process is different for every website. On page 1 of the quoting process one company asks you for name/address/phone for example, but another company asks for name/address/phone. and  date of birth.
[2013-06-27 08:42:56] peshom: I am doing some high level planing where once I submit the client information to the script, it would be able to detect which website I am on, which page of the quoting process it is on and input only the appropriate fields then wait until I move to another page where it will enter  the information required on that page.
[2013-06-27 08:43:53] Dave_B_: ah cool. You certainly could do it that way, I think I'd probably not do it via periodic page checking but rather when I arrive on whatever page immediately check
[2013-06-27 08:44:38] peshom: Oh! Much better! That would certainly make it more efficient.
[2013-06-27 08:44:44] jamesoram, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-06-27 08:45:22] peshom: So I would have to somehow combine URL and Page element checking so the driver can decide what it needs to fill out.
[2013-06-27 08:45:56] peshom: Eventually I would want to automate the whole process and just click a button and it spits out aa quote for me, but that would require quite a bit of testing :)
[2013-06-27 08:47:34] peshom: Which leads me to my next question. Is it possible to drive a browser in the "background"? Ultimately all I am interested in is the PDF file with the quote. Is it possible to make WebDriver ge to that PDF without showing me the browser and what it populates and just give me the quote once it's done?

[2013-06-27 08:49:03] Dave_B_: yes, quite possible
[2013-06-27 08:49:23] Dave_B_: I run a bunch of grid nodes as a service which makes them 'invisible'
[2013-06-27 08:49:52] Dave_B_: they navigate to pages, fill stuff in etc and I just get the results

[2013-06-27 08:50:44] tobie, quitting. (Quit: tobie)
[2013-06-27 08:50:47] Dave_B_: like: Certain pages behave differently if they have focus or not
[2013-06-27 08:51:09] Dave_B_: running as a service mostly seems to fool them
[2013-06-27 08:51:17] Dave_B_: in IE9 though this doesn't entirely work
[2013-06-27 08:51:17] peshom: And umm... What is a "grid node"?
[2013-06-27 08:51:39] Oscar1: selenium grid nodes
[2013-06-27 08:51:40] Dave_B_: oh, right. So I'm using RemoteWebDriver instead of e.g. FirefoxDriver
[2013-06-27 08:52:01] peshom: Oh great... It's IE9 that I'll most likely be automating. Insurance companies don't support anything besides IE...

[2013-06-27 08:52:19] Dave_B_: and it goes off to a 'hub' and then to a 'node' then that node drives the browser instance ... all of which can quite happily be local

[2013-06-27 11:15:23] jimevans: ?

[2013-06-27 11:17:36] jimevans: jleyba: from java? use the InternetExplorerDriverService.Builder

[2013-06-27 11:22:31] nicegraham: jimevans: does iedriver support proxies?
[2013-06-27 11:23:16] jimevans: nicegraham: in what way? if there's a proxy installed on the system, it'll use it. getting that proxy installed is a challenge, and involves destructively editing the registry.
[2013-06-27 11:23:19] dawagner, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-06-27 11:23:34] nicegraham: no, I mean an external proxy
[2013-06-27 11:23:38] nicegraham: like BMP
[2013-06-27 11:23:38] jimevans: the java bindings have some code that will modify the registry for you
[2013-06-27 11:23:49] jimevans: same answer applies
[2013-06-27 11:24:00] jimevans: it's all handled in the registry for IE.
[2013-06-27 11:24:18] nicegraham: How destructively does it change the registry?
[2013-06-27 11:24:43] jimevans: by "destructively" i mean it changes the settings for the system.
[2013-06-27 11:24:57] jimevans: every instance of IE for that user thereafter will use that same proxy
[2013-06-27 11:25:04] chrisgao: AutomatedTester: Hi, there?
[2013-06-27 11:25:22] jimevans: and there's no way to "save the settings and change back" because what do you do in the multiple-instances-of-IE case?
[2013-06-27 11:25:24] nicegraham: ok, I'll mull that over and see if that's an issue for us - thanks for the info
[2013-06-27 11:26:47] jimevans: nicegraham: like i said, the java bindings have code that will modify the registry to point IE to whatever proxy you want. i've not migrated that code into the IE driver itself because of my reluctance to permanently change user-wide settings on a user's machine.
[2013-06-27 11:27:38] nicegraham: that's fair enough, is that functionality the normal add proxy to caps
[2013-06-27 11:27:42] nicegraham: or is it more involved/
[2013-06-27 11:27:44] nicegraham: ?
[2013-06-27 11:27:55] jimevans: nicegraham: no, nothing more involved than that.
[2013-06-27 11:28:10] nicegraham: well that's nice at least :)
[2013-06-27 11:28:20] nicegraham: you're some man for dealing with IE :)
[2013-06-27 11:28:30] jimevans: well, no, it actually sucks, but it's all we can do at the moment.

[2013-06-27 11:30:02] jimevans: IE's not so bad actually. the only real depressing thing is the insistence that every setting should be global for a user, and that there's no concept of a "profile" that one can point to that will isolate the settings for *only* that instance of IE.

[2013-06-27 12:35:48] brma: 2.6 - 2.7 support either
[2013-06-27 12:36:04] tobie, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-27 12:36:24] brma: peshom: read my comments ^.  That file is incompatible with python 3.3
[2013-06-27 12:36:45] chrisgao: AutomatedTester:  is it possible to make a change to firefox driver extension in order to open a new tab or active a tab?
[2013-06-27 12:36:47] peshom: Oh! ... Well I was hoping to use the IDE to generate some examples for myself to familiarize myself with test writing, but... Yeah...
[2013-06-27 12:37:19] brma: You still can, you'll just need to manually modify that line.  Or even easier, just use python 2.7
[2013-06-27 12:37:39] tobie, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-06-27 12:38:03] peshom: Well, I don't know python (yet) so shouldn't I try to learn 3.3?
[2013-06-27 12:38:37] Dude-X: you should probably use python 2.7 since 100% of stuff works with 2.7
[2013-06-27 12:38:54] Dude-X: and about 50% of popular packages works with python3
[2013-06-27 12:39:04] Dude-X: selenium python works on python 3.2+
[2013-06-27 12:39:16] brma: Interesting question.  More and more projects are supporting 3.x, but *everything* still supports 2.7
[2013-06-27 12:39:48] wolcanus, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-27 12:40:01] brma: Maybe AutomatedTester has an opinion?
[2013-06-27 12:40:21] AutomatedTester: chrisgao: it is possible
[2013-06-27 12:40:27] AutomatedTester: but why are you wanting to do that?
[2013-06-27 12:40:37] tobie, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-27 12:41:11] AutomatedTester: brma: use both ;)
[2013-06-27 12:41:54] chrisgao: AutomatedTeser: we have a performance benchmark on  tab switching, it requires these two features.
[2013-06-27 12:42:19] chrisgao: I can do it by myself, but would you give me some code pointer for that?
[2013-06-27 12:42:27] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: the issue about emulating how a user uses a browser…. how come we don't support tabs?
[2013-06-27 12:42:37] Dude-X: (other than ease of use for the API)
[2013-06-27 12:42:47] AutomatedTester: ease of use
[2013-06-27 12:43:19] Dude-X: maybe for web driver 3.0, we should have tab support
[2013-06-27 12:43:31] jimevans: Dude-X: oh dear god please no.
[2013-06-27 12:43:37] Dude-X: would be nice to test "link opens a tab" versus "link opens a window"
[2013-06-27 12:44:05] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: we force everything into a new window
[2013-06-27 12:44:12] Dude-X: well since you vehemently object, let's save it for web driver 4.0 :p
[2013-06-27 12:44:33] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: there is no real use case for web users to do tab vs window
[2013-06-27 12:45:05] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: switch_to_window in marionette will cycle through things
[2013-06-27 12:45:07] brma: Will marionette enable tab support?
[2013-06-27 12:45:11] lukeis: "For users who have never changed their default browser settings, have link x open in a new tab, have link y open in a window" ;)
[2013-06-27 12:45:13] AutomatedTester: tabs and windows
[2013-06-27 12:45:27] AutomatedTester: lukeis: but WE change that setting for them
[2013-06-27 12:45:32] lukeis: i know
[2013-06-27 12:45:35] AutomatedTester: so your use case is moot
[2013-06-27 12:45:43] Dude-X: at my former job, we would sometimes open a new window, and some would open a new tab
[2013-06-27 12:46:01] lukeis: AutomatedTester: I was speaking as some Product Owner who doesn't necessarily know better ;)
[2013-06-27 12:46:28] llaskin, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-27 12:46:38] Dude-X: although I think it's a bad design decision to open a new window
[2013-06-27 12:46:46] Dude-X: i prefer to respect users settings
[2013-06-27 12:47:06] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: you will be shocked by what we change then...
[2013-06-27 12:47:13] lukeis: opening a window at all is a bad design decision ;)
[2013-06-27 12:47:26] Dude-X: sometimes it makes sense
[2013-06-27 12:47:41] dimacus1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-27 12:47:44] chrisgao: AutomatedTester: another question. In "Web Developer--Web Console", I can get values of window.performance.timing.*, but I can NOT get the values through webdriver. Is there a workaround?
[2013-06-27 12:47:45] Dude-X: like a user prints a page
[2013-06-27 12:47:56] lukeis: you don't need a new page for that
[2013-06-27 12:48:09] lukeis: CSS can do magical things ;)
[2013-06-27 12:48:16] Dude-X: in gmail, chrome opens a new tab
[2013-06-27 12:48:23] lukeis: that it does
[2013-06-27 12:48:42] AutomatedTester: chrisgao: driver.executeScript("return window.performance.timing;")
[2013-06-27 12:49:13] lukeis: Dude-X: in their case it's likely cause the app is so complex (and all the data is in frames, etc.) that it was probably too hard to print straight away
[2013-06-27 12:49:33] Dude-X: it's also a preview of how it's going to print too
[2013-06-27 12:49:36] lukeis: but in that case it's a new window
[2013-06-27 12:49:50] dimacus, quitting. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2013-06-27 12:49:55] lukeis: haven't heard a justification for needing it in a new tab ;)
[2013-06-27 12:50:31] davidlai: hey, i know this seems like a silly question.. is there a way to do some sort of 'no opp' to keep selenium from timing out (using saucelabs setup), while I'm waiting for an email to be delivered?
[2013-06-27 12:50:37] Dude-X: it seems to be the common UX experience for me when doing a print preview

[2013-06-27 12:51:01] davidlai: should I just spool a different thread and send it useless javascript commands?
[2013-06-27 12:51:02] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: to your test it doesnt know the difference
[2013-06-27 12:51:19] Dude-X: davidlai: you still have to poll somehow to know when your email is delivered
[2013-06-27 12:51:20] lukeis: davidlai: i would do something similar (or even use) a WebDriverWait
[2013-06-27 12:51:43] davidlai: I'm not using selenium to check emails, this is done in imap
[2013-06-27 12:51:47] lukeis: FluentWait is the base class, in case you don't want to use it
[2013-06-27 12:52:05] davidlai: but I need selenium to wait around, while I get the email which I extract a email confirmation link from.
[2013-06-27 12:52:16] Dude-X: i don't know if sauce labs sets a timeout while waiting for commands
[2013-06-27 12:52:16] lukeis: you need your test to do it though?
[2013-06-27 12:52:26] lukeis: driver.quit() will end the test session
[2013-06-27 12:52:40] Dude-X: selenium doesn't timeout, only you set the timeouts
[2013-06-27 12:52:59] davidlai: sauce labs seems like there's a 90 second timeout between commands
[2013-06-27 12:53:29] lukeis: sounds like a sauce thing… santiycr? ;)
[2013-06-27 12:53:30] Dude-X: interesting. maybe execute a do nothing javascript
[2013-06-27 12:54:02] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-27 12:54:37] santiycr: davidlai:  tell me more
[2013-06-27 12:54:52] santiycr: oh, timeout between commands, yes
[2013-06-27 12:55:06] santiycr: we have that to prevent our system from running tests forever when a customer script crashes
[2013-06-27 12:55:24] santiycr: https://saucelabs.com/docs/additional-config#idle-timeout
[2013-06-27 12:55:31] santiycr: grid has it too
[2013-06-27 12:56:21] santiycr: Selenium server can be more sloppy about these
[2013-06-27 12:56:26] davidlai: for 1 period of my test, it can take up to 5 minutes to wait for the email delievery.  would the best way be just spawn a thread and poll using webdriver.execute("1=1")
[2013-06-27 12:56:30] santiycr: tks lukeis
[2013-06-27 12:56:54] santiycr: davidlai:  that's exactly what I was going to recommend
[2013-06-27 12:57:06] santiycr: you can also increase the idle-timeout
[2013-06-27 12:57:36] santiycr: but that also means that every time a script in your end crashes or looses connectivity, sauce will charge 5' of usage before ending the session
[2013-06-27 12:57:37] chrisgao: AutomatedTester: thx, it works. Can firefox provide other timeline data for Image decoding and the like?
[2013-06-27 12:57:47] davidlai: is it also possible to increase the 30 min timeout for a long running test?  (regression test suite)
[2013-06-27 12:58:00] AutomatedTester: chrisgao: not sure
[2013-06-27 12:58:18] AutomatedTester: I suggest asking in #devtools on irc.mozilla.org
[2013-06-27 12:58:31] Dude-X: davidlai: do you have control over the email sending? why not write to a text file and have a separate test to test real email sending?

[2013-06-27 13:00:01] davidlai: Dude-X, already doing that for integration tests.  But we do need 1 acceptance test that ties it all together to be part of an acceptance criteria.
[2013-06-27 13:00:11] Dude-X: ah
[2013-06-27 13:00:34] santiycr: davidlai:  yeah, you can increase it up to 2h, it's the 'max-duration' capability, same docs
