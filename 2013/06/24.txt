[2013-06-24 03:41:43] Trbs: Hi there
[2013-06-24 03:41:50] Phil37: hi
[2013-06-24 03:42:09] Trbs: I am having problem with Firefox WebDriver ... trying to sendKeys ...
[2013-06-24 03:42:35] Trbs: When ever I try to send CTRL+T or anything else ... I will get Context meny open
[2013-06-24 03:43:04] Trbs: I have tried multiple approaches ... to send keys (CTRL right left ) but I will get same result always ...
[2013-06-24 03:43:17] Trbs: Has anyone had similar problem before ?
[2013-06-24 03:43:18] Phil37: what are you passing through into the sendKeys method?
[2013-06-24 03:43:33] Trbs: ac.ContextClick(el).SendKeys(((char)0xE009).ToString()).SendKeys(key).Build().Perform();
[2013-06-24 03:44:28] Trbs: I have tried this as well ac.ContextClick(el).SendKeys(OpenQA.Selenium.Keys.Control.ToString()).SendKeys(key.ToString()).Build().Perform();
[2013-06-24 03:44:50] Trbs: sorry I forgot to say I am using c# version
[2013-06-24 03:45:05] Phil37: ac is your driver instance?
[2013-06-24 03:45:18] Trbs: new Actions(dr).SendKeys(driver.FindElement(By.TagName("html")), System.Windows.Forms.Keys.Control.ToString())                                .SendKeys(driver.FindElement(By.TagName("html")), key.ToString()).Build().Perform();
[2013-06-24 03:45:27] Trbs: ac is Action
[2013-06-24 03:45:35] Phil37: ah sorry
[2013-06-24 03:45:37] Trbs: dr in ac is instance
[2013-06-24 03:45:51] Trbs: var ac = new Actions(dr);
[2013-06-24 03:45:56] Trbs: IWebElement el = driver.FindElement(By.TagName("html"));
[2013-06-24 03:46:12] Trbs: ac.MoveToElement(el);
[2013-06-24 03:46:12] Phil37: and you just want to send CTRL + T to the element?  not bring up the context menu?
[2013-06-24 03:46:17] Trbs:             ac.ContextClick(el).SendKeys(OpenQA.Selenium.Keys.Control.ToString()).SendKeys(key.ToString()).Build().Perform();
[2013-06-24 03:46:25] Trbs: yes ...
[2013-06-24 03:47:04] Trbs: ok is it ContextClick :)
[2013-06-24 03:47:09] Trbs: ?
[2013-06-24 03:47:24] Phil37: thats probably whats making the menu come up yeah
[2013-06-24 03:48:11] Trbs: hahah I am such ... :) sorry I thought that ContextClick means clicking in the context of element ... HTML or what ever is element ...
[2013-06-24 03:48:42] Phil37: ha, easy mistake to make
[2013-06-24 03:49:41] Trbs: thanks :) I should have read document before I start asking quesitons
[2013-06-24 03:50:06] Phil37: i think this is the kind of thing you're after? http://pastebin.com/Ri5V7QVF
[2013-06-24 03:50:42] Phil37: thats for the java bindings but it should be similar for c#

[2013-06-24 06:01:16] coreygriggs, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-24 06:01:56] Dave_B_: http://gridHubLocalion:4444/grid/console should show you (port may vary if you changed it)
[2013-06-24 06:02:23] Dave_B_: greyed out icons = activity (mouse over for what they just did)
[2013-06-24 06:02:25] jrock20041: I see that, but it only shows the machines on the grid
[2013-06-24 06:02:39] jrock20041: it does not show if any of them are in use at this time
[2013-06-24 06:02:50] Dave_B_: that suggests to me that none are
[2013-06-24 06:03:14] Dave_B_: if you see browser icons with proper colours they are idle
[2013-06-24 06:04:10] jrock20041: I just remoted into one of the machines, and the test is running on it
[2013-06-24 06:04:32] jrock20041: if I go into the console, it looks like the others. Nothing really showing that its being used
[2013-06-24 06:05:27] Dave_B_: thats odd :( what version you using?
[2013-06-24 06:05:43] jrock20041: For each defaultremoteproxy, I see listening on, test session timeout, supports up to 5 concurrent tests, then I see browser icons
[2013-06-24 06:05:49] jrock20041: 2.32.0
[2013-06-24 06:06:15] jrock20041: grid hub 2.32.0
[2013-06-24 06:06:41] Dave_B_: sounds fine - 2.32.0 on one of my grids here
[2013-06-24 06:06:44] Dave_B_: it shows usage
[2013-06-24 06:07:05] Dave_B_: you definitely using just the one grid? Not another hub/node that could be active?
[2013-06-24 06:07:25] Dave_B_: if so I think we'll need someone with better knowledge thasn me to show up :( sorry!
[2013-06-24 06:07:29] jrock20041: I have a hub and 8 machines that connect to that hub

[2013-06-24 06:09:32] jrock20041: do I have to launch the hub with a certain parameter to get those usages?
[2013-06-24 06:09:53] Dave_B_: default should tell you

[2013-06-24 06:10:11] Dave_B_: but one+ of those icons should be grey
[2013-06-24 06:10:15] Dave_B_: if its in use :S

[2013-06-24 06:12:10] jrock20041: Does the number of firefox icon I see mean how many firefox windows I can have open?
[2013-06-24 06:12:45] Dave_B_: yes, ish. You can have up to that many firefoxes matching certain criteria, but you may also have a max concurrent tests that will limit total browsers of any variety
[2013-06-24 06:13:01] Dave_B_: e.g. 'up to 5 concurrent' with 3 chrome open means just 2 firefox allowed
[2013-06-24 06:14:14] Dave_B_: also by default I *think* 2.32 will show both SeleniumRemoteProxy and WebDriverRemoteProxy (aka DefaultRemoteProxy) which will mean you can see 10 icons but only 5 will likely match your CapabilityMatcher

[2013-06-24 08:50:21] lukeis: isn't there a mailing list thread with the solution for that? I seem to recall one...
[2013-06-24 08:50:24] smccarthy: Phasze: it built SeleniumGridExtras-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar and SeleniumGridExtras-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  . I am not sure which one you/we need

[2013-06-24 08:51:14] jimevans: lukeis: his problem is that he wanted to get a screenshot of an android driver, using remote webdriver. for .NET, that means subclassing RemoteWebDriver and adding the ITakesScreenshot implementation.
[2013-06-24 08:51:16] smccarthy: Phasze: k ! :) probably best lol
[2013-06-24 08:51:41] jimevans: but then, he was using RemoteWebDriver, and needed to change the orientation. and RemoteWebDriver doesn't implement IRotatable.

[2013-06-24 08:51:55] jimevans: so he needed to add the implementation for that as well.
[2013-06-24 08:52:17] jimevans: of course, he would've been better off just using the AndroidDriver class for the .NET bindings, which already does that (or should)
[2013-06-24 08:52:31] AutomatedTester: jimevans: how would you tell android driver with grid to change orientation?
[2013-06-24 08:53:04] jimevans: how do you do it in java?
[2013-06-24 08:53:22] AutomatedTester: I suspect it has similar issues
[2013-06-24 08:53:31] lukeis: with the Rotatable interface
[2013-06-24 08:53:47] jimevans: does Java's RemoteWebDriver implement Rotatable?
[2013-06-24 08:53:53] jimevans: (if so, that sounds wrong to me)
[2013-06-24 08:54:19] jimevans: in other words, there's not a direct cast, right?
[2013-06-24 08:54:27] jimevans: you have to use the augmenter, i'd imagine

[2013-06-24 09:06:07] jimevans: it breaks in the "base class case" where the base class doesn't implement all of the interfaces.

[2013-06-24 09:22:29] vascobnunes: can anyone help me out?
[2013-06-24 09:24:14] lukeis: finding the element doesn't cause that exception... clicking on it will
[2013-06-24 09:24:25] lukeis: is the input actually visible?

[2013-06-24 09:29:24] dimacus: just in repo or is there a rubygems.org thing just for jars?
[2013-06-24 09:29:29] vascobnunes: lukeis: yes, cause I clicked the button that displays that menu
[2013-06-24 09:30:04] lukeis: dimacus: it's call maven central :)
[2013-06-24 09:30:08] lukeis: called*

[2013-06-24 09:30:10] vascobnunes: Oscar_Rieken: starting to feel the same here

[2013-06-24 09:30:44] jimevans: vascobnunes: are you sure the browser has had time to render the input as visible when you try to manipulate it?
[2013-06-24 09:31:20] vascobnunes: jimevans: not sure. how do I assure that it did?
[2013-06-24 09:31:22] lukeis: dimacus: :google how to publish to maven central

[2013-06-24 09:31:56] dimacus: mucho gracias
[2013-06-24 09:31:57] jimevans: vascobnunes: the short answer is "use an explicit wait". the details of that answer are widely available on the web.
[2013-06-24 09:36:33] lukeis: dimacus: this is the real step-by-step guide to doing it https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide
[2013-06-24 09:36:56] dimacus: i shall follow it when i feel release is ready
[2013-06-24 09:37:13] dimacus: getting close… i wanna finish the first run auto config questionare
[2013-06-24 09:37:14] lukeis: you should start now... cause you have to log a ticket and they have to approve you
[2013-06-24 09:37:21] dimacus: that way it's not parsing ugly json
[2013-06-24 09:37:31] dimacus: ahh ok
[2013-06-24 09:37:56] Oscar_Rieken: what are you uploading?
[2013-06-24 09:38:08] lukeis: grid-extras
[2013-06-24 09:38:09] dimacus: the grid extras stuff
[2013-06-24 09:38:33] dimacus: it's gonna be awesome… added ability to self upgrade/downgrade webdriver.jar through the HTTP api
[2013-06-24 09:38:45] dimacus: working with nicegraham to get a pretty pretty guy
[2013-06-24 09:38:47] dimacus: gui
[2013-06-24 09:39:10] dimacus: and he is digging into the Grid api to expose it via servlet

[2013-06-24 09:43:10] dimacus: will start windows testing tomorrow
[2013-06-24 09:43:54] Phasze: dimacus: I notice the extras add GUI controls and whatnot, does it also add the ability to force close something like IEDriverServer and all instances of IE after a test is run?
[2013-06-24 09:44:06] dimacus: aha
[2013-06-24 09:44:14] dimacus: when you started the jar, in your borwser go to

[2013-06-24 09:45:48] dimacus: hahaha
[2013-06-24 09:45:51] nirvdrum: dimacus: What lukeis said.
[2013-06-24 09:46:06] nirvdrum: We have enough angry people at Mogotest right now ;-)
[2013-06-24 09:46:27] dimacus: i think that can be arranged, just pm me and we will figure out how to make it so
[2013-06-24 09:46:32] lukeis: there is a SeleniumHQ org ;) not sure how simon would feel about that though
[2013-06-24 09:46:54] dimacus: probably kill us with a rusty nail
[2013-06-24 09:46:55] nirvdrum: lukeis: Well, Simon's feelings on it are why it didn't happen at SeleniumConf in London.
[2013-06-24 09:47:15] dimacus: wait which part didn't happen?
[2013-06-24 09:47:43] nirvdrum: Francois and I were looking to have a semi-offiicial home for servlets, proxies, and other grid implementations.
[2013-06-24 09:47:57] nirvdrum: Things that clearly wouldn't fit into Selenium proper.
[2013-06-24 09:48:16] lukeis: seems like a perfect fit into seleniumhq org :-/
[2013-06-24 09:48:18] dimacus: yeah
[2013-06-24 09:48:23] nirvdrum: I think consolidating in one location would be nice.  Simon's thoughts were they should all be hosted wherever. E.g., Sauce hosting the sauce grid plugin.

[2013-06-24 09:49:02] nirvdrum: I think that'd be a mess and largely defeats the point.  I wanted a place where you could either: a) find something that fits your needs, or b) have a good example to work from.
[2013-06-24 09:49:24] nirvdrum: Anyway, neither Francois nor I had the energy to really fight it.  So, the project was dropped on the floor.
[2013-06-24 09:49:33] dimacus: nirvdrum:  i do own http://seleniumplugins.org
[2013-06-24 09:49:53] nirvdrum: Incidentally, that's also where I had planned on placing all the material from the London workshop on customizing grid.

[2013-06-24 09:53:37] dimacus: it has a ton of stuff in there until we figure it out

[2013-06-24 09:56:07] nirvdrum: You need to add it to the classpath.
[2013-06-24 09:56:46] Phasze: I need to or he does?
[2013-06-24 09:57:08] nirvdrum: You need to.
[2013-06-24 09:57:17] dimacus: Phasze: hold on what command are you running? can you copy paste?
[2013-06-24 09:57:21] nirvdrum: You can't just put the JAR in the same directory.  You need to explicitly add it to the classpath.
[2013-06-24 09:57:38] Phasze: ah, yeah I just put them in the same directory
[2013-06-24 09:58:53] Oscar_Rieken: nice work on that add jar

[2013-06-24 09:59:52] Oscar_Rieken: grid-extras
[2013-06-24 10:00:01] Oscar_Rieken: looks good might play with it on my grid in a bit

[2013-06-24 10:27:27] jrock20041: I understand the parallel part
[2013-06-24 10:28:30] nicegraham: you need to quit() at the end of each test
[2013-06-24 10:28:36] ShawnM: perhaps that the driver session and object gets explicitly destroyed in your runtime so it doesn't hang sessions or something?

[2013-06-24 10:32:40] nicegraham: nirvdrum: following on from dimacus was saying... do you think it would be better to use the grid api available and decouple the selenium-grid-extras from grid [not have it run as a servlet] or just install as a servlet?
[2013-06-24 10:35:31] jrock20041: nicegraham: Yeah, we quit on every tests. ok thanks
[2013-06-24 10:37:36] nirvdrum: nicegraham: I haven't really had time to look at what grid-extras does.  But generally speaking, I'm a bigger fan of having a servlet.  The big grid environments I'm aware of all have very different set ups, so I question whether there really could be a single API that meets all needs.  Plus, as a servlet, there's no need to worry about API compat.

[2013-06-24 10:51:51] Dude-X_, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-24 10:52:13] dimacus: not yet, but let me give you a brief shpeal
[2013-06-24 10:52:23] dimacus: lets say node1 is running a test
[2013-06-24 10:52:33] dimacus: and you want to take a screenshot on that node
[2013-06-24 10:52:47] dimacus: you will make an HTTP Get request against that node
[2013-06-24 10:52:54] Phasze: yeah but how do you know which  node?
[2013-06-24 10:52:56] dimacus: http://node1:3000/screenshot
[2013-06-24 10:53:10] dimacus: we are currently working on that
[2013-06-24 10:53:23] Phasze: hehe, well that's the part I'm stuck at :P
[2013-06-24 10:53:28] dimacus: that is, finding out from grid which node is running which test
[2013-06-24 10:53:43] dimacus: do you know any java?
[2013-06-24 10:53:46] Phasze: yeah
[2013-06-24 10:53:48] dimacus: maybe we can do it faster
[2013-06-24 10:53:59] Phasze: my main language is C# but java is quite similar
[2013-06-24 10:54:05] dimacus: yeah true
[2013-06-24 10:54:21] dimacus: nicegraham:  do you know the grid2 api point to see which Session is running on Which node?
[2013-06-24 10:55:58] Phasze: Currently, I just give my compiled .dll files to NUnit which runs the test against grid, I can always parse the console for session id's but can't ever really know from that which node it was given to.
[2013-06-24 10:56:17] dimacus: ok let me take a look at that now
[2013-06-24 10:57:02] nicegraham: dimacus: I don't think you can
[2013-06-24 10:57:05] mezmor, changing nick to Mezmor.
[2013-06-24 10:57:16] nicegraham: you can ask for a particular node status
[2013-06-24 10:57:27] dimacus: really? that sounds like something that should totally be built in
[2013-06-24 10:57:27] nicegraham: or for a particular session status
[2013-06-24 10:57:44] nicegraham: I think you can also get a list of current testsesions via the wd/hub/status
[2013-06-24 10:58:04] dimacus: ok so can we see current sessions, then ask 1 session what machine it is on?
[2013-06-24 10:58:32] nicegraham: I imagine so - but there's no way to see a full list of nodes
[2013-06-24 10:58:52] Phasze: heh, was hoping not to have to check grid/console to parse which session it was running on
[2013-06-24 10:58:54] nicegraham: I think we should just build it as a servlet and have access to everything
[2013-06-24 10:58:57] dimacus: i guess it's fine as long as we can get session -> machine
[2013-06-24 10:58:59] dimacus: in some way
[2013-06-24 10:59:06] dimacus: nicegraham:  +100
[2013-06-24 10:59:43] dimacus: add it as a servlet for now
[2013-06-24 10:59:54] jimevans: so… all you grid experts: what does a node have to do to register with a hub for the hub to recognize it?
[2013-06-24 10:59:57] dimacus: once we figure out how to do it via servlet, we add that functionality diretly to grid
[2013-06-24 10:59:59] nicegraham: we just have to potentially do a release per selenium release
[2013-06-24 11:00:02] dimacus: and only use the http apo
[2013-06-24 11:00:28] jimevans: (he asked without doing a single bit of research on his own)
[2013-06-24 11:00:33] nicegraham: just hit the register endpoint with a  json object
[2013-06-24 11:00:50] dimacus: nicegraham:  this way we have a servlet for old versions and going forward we have a real api built into the grid itself
[2013-06-24 11:01:18] nicegraham: jimaevans: I started writing them all down at the weekend https://github.com/nicegraham/selenium-grid2-api
[2013-06-24 11:01:45] jimevans: nicegraham: thanks for that. i'm thinking of alternative (i.e., not produced by the selenium project) node implementations.
[2013-06-24 11:01:50] nicegraham: yeah, we can see what info we need and then build out the api to match

[2013-06-24 11:09:32] lukeis: zx29b: ^
[2013-06-24 11:09:32] nicegraham: depends on your usage
[2013-06-24 11:09:33] Phasze: especially if I have two tests running against the same browser on different nodes
[2013-06-24 11:09:45] nicegraham: if you have the session already created
[2013-06-24 11:09:49] lukeis: err, two years ago
[2013-06-24 11:10:04] nicegraham: you have access to the session id
[2013-06-24 11:10:29] admc, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-06-24 11:12:09] Phasze: nicegraham: like execute a test and wait for it to assign a session id before starting any other tests?
[2013-06-24 11:13:10] dimacus: i don't think you even get session id from grid before a node is assigned
[2013-06-24 11:13:22] dimacus: you sit in queue until a box is free, then you get a session
[2013-06-24 11:13:30] Phasze: that's why I said wait for it before continuing
[2013-06-24 11:13:49] Phasze: but that seems like an unnecessary pause that I would hope could be avoided
[2013-06-24 11:13:58] nicegraham: when your tests get's it's remote web driver instance it has a session id at that point
[2013-06-24 11:14:27] nicegraham: so at the earliest point it means anything you have access to the session id
[2013-06-24 11:15:24] Phasze: which means I wouldn't be able to start any test that uses the same browser at the same time, I would have to wait for the first to get a session id before starting the second.
[2013-06-24 11:16:20] nicegraham: assuming you only have one browser to test on
[2013-06-24 11:16:33] nicegraham: at which point - why bother using grid?
[2013-06-24 11:17:02] Phasze: no, assuming the only browser left, or the order of the browsers happen to coinside
[2013-06-24 11:17:05] Phasze: which happens quite often
[2013-06-24 11:17:11] dimacus: my only case for using grid, is bc windows cannot install all dependencies on windows boxes, so i have to use grid and IE as dumb browsers
[2013-06-24 11:17:51] nicegraham: Phasze: what are you trying to do? I'm confused :)
[2013-06-24 11:18:43] Phasze: so let's say I have 2 machines each set up to run 1 instance of chrome and 1 of firefox
[2013-06-24 11:18:55] Phasze: so it could run 4 tests at once maximum
[2013-06-24 11:19:09] nicegraham: yes
[2013-06-24 11:19:19] Phasze: if I run 2-3 tests at the same time and each get queued for firefox
[2013-06-24 11:19:35] Phasze: how would I know which one was assigned which node without one having to wait for the other before being queued?
[2013-06-24 11:19:45] kedoodek, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2013-06-24 11:20:14] nicegraham: when the test proceeds it will have a session id and can then figure out which node it's running on
[2013-06-24 11:20:33] nicegraham: the other ones will be paused waiting for grid to give them a session
[2013-06-24 11:20:54] nicegraham: you can also see what test sessions are active on the wd/hub/status
[2013-06-24 11:21:24] Phasze: well, only one test would be paused, since it could assign two almost immediately

[2013-06-24 11:21:43] nicegraham: yes

[2013-06-24 11:22:07] nicegraham: which test is on which node?
[2013-06-24 11:22:13] Phasze: yes
[2013-06-24 11:22:16] dimacus: nicegraham:  i think what he wants to know is
[2013-06-24 11:22:18] nicegraham: how do you currently see your running test?
[2013-06-24 11:22:24] dimacus: sesion asdfljklasdf is runing on 10.1.1.10
[2013-06-24 11:22:31] dimacus: progromatically
[2013-06-24 11:23:05] nicegraham: you could do that via the wd/hub/status to get the current testsessions and then testsession?id= to get more details
[2013-06-24 11:23:17] nirvdrum, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2013-06-24 11:23:25] dimacus: i shall try that right now
[2013-06-24 11:23:29] nicegraham: but I don't think that would link back to your internal testcase id or whatever identifier you're using
[2013-06-24 11:23:38] Phasze: right
[2013-06-24 11:23:58] nicegraham: the only way to do that is to have the testcase report what session id / node it's running on
[2013-06-24 11:24:18] Phasze: how would I do that?
[2013-06-24 11:24:39] nicegraham: I'll do up a demo - give me a few minutes
[2013-06-24 11:24:45] Phasze: thanks :)
[2013-06-24 11:24:55] dimacus: thank you
[2013-06-24 11:25:09] dimacus: i want that demo too… but i'll let Phasze look stupid by asking the question
[2013-06-24 11:25:16] Phasze: haha
[2013-06-24 11:25:20] Phasze: thanks dimacus
[2013-06-24 11:25:34] nicegraham: dimacus: I already gave you the code!

[2013-06-24 11:26:03] dimacus: too many fires to deal with
[2013-06-24 11:27:03] Phasze: that's my current fire, sometimes a bloody test won't close properly or something else will stop it and I want to force it to death, but no way to tell which node it was running on without writing my own console parser or something to run on each node
[2013-06-24 11:28:29] dimacus: yeah i ran into similar issue a while back
[2013-06-24 11:29:26] Phasze: I can't just kill the process id's inside the test either, because that affects the hub in C# and not the node :P
[2013-06-24 11:30:08] dimacus: yeah
[2013-06-24 11:30:54] dimacus: so basically, once we get the info from nicegraham on how to associate session -> node, we should be able to do a netstat call on the node box to see what is the PID that takes up the webdriver port
[2013-06-24 11:30:57] Phasze: so being able to use this lovely gridextras to do the work would be ideal :)
[2013-06-24 11:30:59] dimacus: and kill −9 it

[2013-06-24 14:36:32] lukeis: don't they take system level proxies though?
[2013-06-24 14:36:34] nirvdrum: Nor can any of the mobile drivers that I'm aware.

[2013-06-24 14:36:53] lukeis: system == OS
[2013-06-24 14:37:00] nirvdrum: And specifying a proxy as a desired capability can totally violate the principle of least surprise.  Since WebDriver will just start the thing up anyway.
[2013-06-24 14:37:13] nirvdrum: lukeis: If you don't have a way to specify the proxy, it's of little consequence.
[2013-06-24 14:37:40] jimevans: nirvdrum: hold on a second there. what do you mean by "will just start the thing up anyway?"
[2013-06-24 14:37:49] jimevans: do you mean won't barf if the proxy can't be set?
[2013-06-24 14:37:56] jimevans: or somethign else?
[2013-06-24 14:38:10] nirvdrum: jimevans: If I tell pass a proxy as a desired attribute to a driver that doesn't support proxies, it'll just start up a browser as if I didn't request a proxy.
[2013-06-24 14:38:24] jimevans: that's what i thought you meant. thanks for clarifying.
[2013-06-24 14:38:31] nirvdrum: Required capabilities should fix that.
[2013-06-24 14:38:44] jimevans: we (driver implementors) should really get on supporting required capabilities.
[2013-06-24 14:38:44] nirvdrum: But it certainly confused the hell out of me at one time.
[2013-06-24 14:38:51] nirvdrum: Because I thought I screwed up my proxy config.
[2013-06-24 14:38:55] jimevans: it confuses a lot of people
[2013-06-24 14:38:58] nirvdrum: And found out the driver just didn't support it.
[2013-06-24 14:39:10] jimevans: they miss the "desired" part of DesiredCapabilities.
[2013-06-24 14:39:21] nirvdrum: AFAIK, there's no list of which drivers support proxies and which don't.
[2013-06-24 14:39:21] jimevans: just because you desire them, doesn't mean you can necessarily have them.
[2013-06-24 14:39:25] jimevans: :)
[2013-06-24 14:39:42] nirvdrum: jimevans: Sure.  But that's an entirely useless feature.  I'd go so far as to call it a cop-out.
[2013-06-24 14:39:44] jimevans: IE's support for them sucks pretty badly.
[2013-06-24 14:39:59] nirvdrum: There is no situation in which I'd ever request a driver with a proxy and accept one without a proxy.
[2013-06-24 14:40:20] jimevans: a fair criticism.
[2013-06-24 14:40:28] nirvdrum: And that goes across the board for every capability I've ever specified.
[2013-06-24 14:40:44] nirvdrum: But, in any event.
[2013-06-24 14:40:59] nirvdrum: Setting all that aside, it's not like setting these proxy servers up is easy or fun.
[2013-06-24 14:40:59] jimevans: i'd take a non-native events driver even if i specified native events.
[2013-06-24 14:41:15] nirvdrum: Hell, I found a half dozen things that BMP didn't do that we've been telling people for years that it does.
[2013-06-24 14:41:28] nirvdrum: There's a pretty big disconnect there.
[2013-06-24 14:41:49] nirvdrum: I've fixed most of them.
[2013-06-24 14:42:19] jimevans: nirvdrum: another clarification, fixed for public consumption, or fixed privately?
[2013-06-24 14:42:43] nirvdrum: Fixed for public consumption.
[2013-06-24 14:42:56] nirvdrum: BMP 2.0 beta 5, IIRC, was lacking some pretty important stuff.
[2013-06-24 14:43:03] nirvdrum: But, I think part of it too is that WebDriver feels like using a smarter HTTP agent.  And every other HTTP agent in the world returns a status code.
[2013-06-24 14:43:03] jimevans: again, i thought so. just making sure i'm following you.

[2013-06-24 14:43:33] Dude-X: jrock20041: i've had that problem with loading custom profiles
[2013-06-24 14:43:36] nirvdrum: jimevans: While fixed now, that ticket has been opened for 4 years with comments spanning the entire history.
[2013-06-24 14:43:38] Dude-X: i'd get obscure errors
[2013-06-24 14:44:20] jimevans: nirvdrum: i don't doubt it. and you're doing yeoman's work getting those fixed and pushed into the project.
[2013-06-24 14:44:27] nirvdrum: jimevans: FWIW, I think that watir-webdriver solution is wholly useless, too.  I don't want the status code for a separate request because it precludes transient failures, UA sniffing, and a whole bunch of other ugliness.  It's just not representative.
[2013-06-24 14:44:37] nirvdrum: jimevans: Which makes me think that guy doesn't really know what he's arguing for.
[2013-06-24 14:44:39] lukeis: jrock20041 / Dude-X:  that IS jim's and my job here... we deal with CI issues (too often)
[2013-06-24 14:44:41] jrock20041: Dude-X: well we do not use custom profiles, but its just weird how a test will fail when ran via Jenkins but I can run locally and they work
[2013-06-24 14:44:58] jrock20041: even if I specify to use a remote browser it stikll works
[2013-06-24 14:45:00] Dude-X: jrock20041: well is it a flaky test, or it doesn't work at all?
[2013-06-24 14:45:22] jimevans: nirvdrum: let's be clear, that's a *proposed* solution, not currently available in watir-webdriver. :)
[2013-06-24 14:45:25] nirvdrum: jimevans: Incidentally, the most useful status code for me to get is a 401, but that locks up virtually every driver implementation anyway :-P
[2013-06-24 14:45:31] jimevans: and yes, it's useless.
[2013-06-24 14:45:46] jimevans: nirvdrum: indee.d
[2013-06-24 14:46:05] jrock20041: Dude-X: well my recent issue is its skipping tests like crazy
[2013-06-24 14:46:12] jimevans: does it lock up IE? i'm thinking it shouldn't, but maybe it does.
[2013-06-24 14:46:21] jrock20041: Let me finish the run and I could get a little more detailed
[2013-06-24 14:46:35] nirvdrum: Mogotest has a feature where we'll fetch your page and auto-find a login form.  That works pretty well with a naive HTTP agent.  But increasingly it's been failing due to dynamically generated pages or cookies being set via JS or some other whacked out shit.
[2013-06-24 14:47:19] nirvdrum: So, running in a browser would fix those problems.  But introduces the complexity of adding the proxy server (which I'm using elsewhere, but it's hardly the pinnacle of efficiency).
[2013-06-24 14:47:50] nirvdrum: jimevans: I haven't tried in a while.  I try to detect a 401 with an HTTP agent beforehand to avoid that situation.
[2013-06-24 14:47:53] lukeis: my perspective on the whole 404 / 500 matter... if your test got to the page unexpectantly wouldn't the next command fail in your test? hopefully then bubbling up an exception and then taking a screenshot as to it being obvious the issue?  (granted this does not help nirvdrum in any way, but he at least has his own working solution... i think)
[2013-06-24 14:48:06] jimevans: nirvdrum: fair enough.
[2013-06-24 14:48:36] nirvdrum: lukeis: That gets to another problem I have.  When convenient, Selenium isn't a testing tool; it's a browser automation tool.  But when convenient we argue testing-only use cases.
[2013-06-24 14:48:46] lukeis: indeed :)
[2013-06-24 14:49:07] nirvdrum: lukeis: Principally, there's no reason a browser automation tool couldn't be used to hit pages outside your control where the error page is not a known entity.
[2013-06-24 14:49:12] lukeis: i guess i'm countering the 'most of your users are asking for this feature'
[2013-06-24 14:49:41] nirvdrum: Oh, well that's an unsubstantiated claim.  If SeleniumConf is any indication, most of our users don't know what the hell a status code is.
[2013-06-24 14:50:41] jrock20041: Is this a conversation on using test status codes in your testing?
[2013-06-24 14:50:42] nirvdrum: Keep in mind, I'm not arguing Selenium should return the full network trace.  I don't even think it's technically possible in most cases.  And there's a lot of corner cases.
[2013-06-24 14:51:01] nirvdrum: I just don't think people asking for it are crazy either.  And I can understand the frustration with some of the justification.

[2013-06-24 14:51:24] nirvdrum: jrock20041: It's a debate about whether Selenium should return response headers and status codes.
[2013-06-24 14:51:43] jrock20041: oh, Jim and I had a talk about this not too long ago
[2013-06-24 14:52:26] jrock20041: The only benefit I could see to status codes is you could tell when your browser was done loading. But I am not sure that would tell you when javascript is done

[2013-06-24 14:53:00] nirvdrum: It's useful to have that info when something goes awry.
[2013-06-24 14:53:02] jrock20041: Web developers are not putting JS at the bottom of the their code so the JS does not start till the page loads
[2013-06-24 14:53:16] nirvdrum: But if you're trying to build a spider or something with phantomjs, it could be really useful.
[2013-06-24 14:53:18] jrock20041: nirvdrum: Did I miss an example of this something goes awry
[2013-06-24 14:53:52] jimevans: nirvdrum: if you're building a spider, don't use webdriver. phantomjs is fine on its own.
[2013-06-24 14:53:59] nirvdrum: jrock20041: A test fails.  Usually I just know that something wasn't present on the page.  Maybe I have a screenshot.  Knowing it's a 500 helps me track down that it was a random server screw up though.
[2013-06-24 14:54:06] nirvdrum: It's just another level of logging.
[2013-06-24 14:54:07] jimevans: but that's just me being troll-ish
[2013-06-24 14:54:17] jimevans: sorry for that.
[2013-06-24 14:54:23] jimevans: i'll try not to do it again.

[2013-06-24 14:55:33] nirvdrum: lukeis: Well, rhino kinda sucks.  Does htmlunit still use that?
[2013-06-24 14:55:34] jrock20041: 3) could be an element that you are looking for has changed

[2013-06-24 14:56:09] nirvdrum: jrock20041: If you have a 404 or 500 or anything other than 200 in most cases, it'd be the same URL.  It'd be the correct page.  You'd just get back unexpected content.
[2013-06-24 14:56:55] nirvdrum: lukeis: That's fine for something you know doesn't execute JS.  But all these friggin' browser vendors are teaching a wave of graphic designers that JavaScript is the end-all be-all of development.
[2013-06-24 14:57:06] lukeis: yes
[2013-06-24 14:57:09] nirvdrum: So you have loads of sites nowadays that won't do shit without JS enabled.

[2013-06-24 14:58:14] nirvdrum: jrock20041: Usually that is sufficient.  I don't think it's deniable that checking if you had a 500 would be far quicker though.
[2013-06-24 14:58:59] jimevans: i've said it before, and i'll say it again, if someone provides me with a patch that has a working implementation, i'll fight tooth and nail to get it committed, even over the objections of other committers. but my bar for "working" is pretty high.
[2013-06-24 14:59:06] jrock20041: so lets say webdriver/selenium did this for you? What would that tell you and or be quicker than what I just stated to do?
[2013-06-24 15:00:01] nirvdrum: jrock20041: A screenshot is not a substitute for a log.
[2013-06-24 15:00:14] nirvdrum: Not to mention, some drivers can't do screenshots.
[2013-06-24 15:00:26] nirvdrum: And others can't screenshot the entire page.
[2013-06-24 15:00:42] lukeis: which drivers can't do screenshots?
