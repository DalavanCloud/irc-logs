[2013-06-26 05:56:15] Bebe_sel: yep that might be a issue
[2013-06-26 05:56:28] Bebe_sel: we don't run the tests on Ubuntu

[2013-06-26 05:56:53] Dude-X_: windows? interesting. i guess that makes sense
[2013-06-26 05:57:06] Dude-X_: maybe i'll take advantage of microsoft's free VMs. but thsoe are timeboxed
[2013-06-26 05:57:07] AutomatedTester: but our test runner is on OSX

[2013-06-26 06:31:37] Guest93852: I just learned about Selenium a couple of days ago and I wanted to see if it possibly is the tool I should use for this...
[2013-06-26 06:32:02] Guest93852: I'll try to format my question as consicely as possible...
[2013-06-26 06:33:50] Guest93852: Can I use Selenium IDE to build an automated process for entering data in an online system? Say I have a file that contains all the information that needs to be entered for a person - first name, last name, date of birth, etc. and all that information needs to be entered in a website that will in the end spit out an auto insurance quote.
[2013-06-26 06:34:09] Oscar1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-26 06:34:12] llaskin: sure
[2013-06-26 06:34:20] llaskin: not the IDE
[2013-06-26 06:34:25] llaskin: but selenium webdriver and a language of your choice
[2013-06-26 06:34:37] llaskin: since you will have to find a way to read in the spreadsheet/csv file/whatever input you are using
[2013-06-26 06:34:38] coreygriggs, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-26 06:35:48] Guest93852: Ahh I see... I was afraid I'd get that answer the IDE looked too good to be true haha... But yeah it has it's purpose I understand.
[2013-06-26 06:36:10] llaskin: why not learn how to program?
[2013-06-26 06:36:14] llaskin: sounds like a good learning exercise!
[2013-06-26 06:36:48] AutomatedTester: Guest93852: IDE is fine but long term it will hurt you more than the short term gains
[2013-06-26 06:37:00] llaskin: AutomatedTester: how will he use the IDE to read in the file
[2013-06-26 06:37:10] llaskin: he wants to read from the file(multiple results) and pass in the data from the file
[2013-06-26 06:37:15] llaskin: ide doesn't support that
[2013-06-26 06:37:23] AutomatedTester: llaskin: it does if he creates a plugin
[2013-06-26 06:37:38] AutomatedTester: I am sure samit has done it already knowing him
[2013-06-26 06:37:42] Guest93852: Oh yeah! I absolutely intend to learn. In fact, I am going back to school and going for computer science so learning to program is definitely the way to go for me
[2013-06-26 06:38:17] AutomatedTester: Guest93852: going straight for webdriver will work out better for you long term
[2013-06-26 06:38:28] Guest93852: I currently work as an isnurance agent thought and was hoping I could make my life easier quicker.
[2013-06-26 06:38:35] AutomatedTester: not only for your sanity but for your career
[2013-06-26 06:38:36] Guest93852: Gotcha!
[2013-06-26 06:38:50] davehunt_: yeah there's a data driven plugin, if that's what you need
[2013-06-26 06:39:08] Guest93852: Does it matter which language I use? I have dabbled with Java a little, but it seems like I'll be working with C++ at school.
[2013-06-26 06:39:57] AutomatedTester: Guest93852: there is a java library, since you know that, but there is also bindings for other languages like .NET, Python, Ruby, PHP
[2013-06-26 06:40:02] AutomatedTester: the list goes on and on
[2013-06-26 06:40:03] davehunt_: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide-sel-blocks/?src=search
[2013-06-26 06:40:04] AutomatedTester: :)
[2013-06-26 06:40:15] davehunt_: but yeah, don't use IDE unless you have to :)
[2013-06-26 06:42:21] Guest93852: Haha I see... OK, ok... I won't be lazy! I'll go with the web driver. Although the plugin that you linked mentioned XML parametarization and the input for the information that I get is already neatly structured in XML... Oh so very tempting!!
[2013-06-26 06:43:16] llaskin: AutomatedTester: when giving a har a name, is there any reason to give a har a specific name?  or just for ease of coding?
[2013-06-26 06:43:33] llaskin: Guest93852: C++ is a great learning language, but not used that much these days.  most colleges do teach in it because of a) not b)
[2013-06-26 06:44:01] AutomatedTester: Guest93852: here is a plan for you. Use IDE, learn the ins and outs of automation and then migrate to webdriver when you're comfortable
[2013-06-26 06:44:14] AutomatedTester: llaskin: C++ is used quite a lot btw
[2013-06-26 06:44:56] AutomatedTester: want to do anything in the world where scalability becomes the priority you move away from higher order languages
[2013-06-26 06:45:18] Guest93852: The reason why I am going with C++ is because the school I am transfering after my first 2 years prefers C++ over anything else
[2013-06-26 06:45:46] AutomatedTester: Guest93852: there is nothing wrong with C++ but make sure you learn other languages too
[2013-06-26 06:46:32] Guest93852: Any particular order of importance? Do you think I should focus on a "class" of languages (desktop or web) or combination of both?
[2013-06-26 06:47:23] AutomatedTester: desktop is dying unless you are doing something specific e.g. a browser or server items
[2013-06-26 06:47:27] AutomatedTester: or an OS
[2013-06-26 06:48:07] AutomatedTester: the server stuff will require C++ but you dont need to go to school to learn all of this :)
[2013-06-26 06:48:30] AutomatedTester: some of the top Selenium core contributors have music degrees and not CS degrees
[2013-06-26 06:48:33] AutomatedTester: and they are awesome
[2013-06-26 06:49:24] Guest93852: So Python, PHP, etc.? Well... the ultimate goal for me is software development job and unfirtunately most HR departmants want to see a degree
[2013-06-26 06:49:48] AutomatedTester: Guest93852: where in the world are you?
[2013-06-26 06:50:04] Guest93852: Besides, I need the structure. I have a full time job and a family. I won't set the time aside to learn unless I "have to". (USA)
[2013-06-26 06:50:32] AutomatedTester: Guest93852: now that is a valid reason to do school, I can appreciate that
[2013-06-26 06:51:00] Guest93852: The degree being required or "have to" do the work? lol
[2013-06-26 06:51:27] AutomatedTester: startups want do'ers, how you learnt to do doesnt make a difference
[2013-06-26 06:52:03] AutomatedTester: my employer, Mozilla, never asked to see my degree because they are more interested in getting things done than you having a fancy bit of paper
[2013-06-26 06:52:23] AutomatedTester: not all HRs are black and white about degrees is my point :)

[2013-06-26 07:05:32] Ardesco: she fell into programming because she didn't know what to do after coming back from Japan and Sony seemed like a good company to work for

[2013-06-26 07:06:18] andreastt: llaskin: I've got a degree in music!

[2013-06-26 07:06:30] andreastt: (=
[2013-06-26 07:06:57] llaskin: you are dude
[2013-06-26 07:07:03] Guest93852: I was reading the documentation for the Sel Blocs that davehunt_ mentioned and the developer mentions the following: "Note that Selenium performs variable substitution before each command executes. When Selenium variables are used in Selblock parameters, which are JavaScript expressions, they are evaluated as literals. So for example, you would write: "$(userid}". Or more simply: userid."
[2013-06-26 07:07:08] Guest93852: What are the implications of this?
[2013-06-26 07:07:48] llaskin: any reason why a firefoxdriver instance would request a page 2x instead of 1x as a normal page request would go?
[2013-06-26 07:08:32] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-26 07:08:37] AutomatedTester: Guest93852: I assume its substituting values
[2013-06-26 07:08:48] AutomatedTester: so it will execute the value to see what it is
[2013-06-26 07:08:56] millenium: anyone know something about Issue 4780: "C# RemoteWebDriver can't take screenshots" there will implementation of ITakesScreenshot to RemoteWebDriver soon :?
[2013-06-26 07:08:56] AutomatedTester: so 'foo' will be foo
[2013-06-26 07:09:04] AutomatedTester: but '1+1' might become 2
[2013-06-26 07:09:12] AutomatedTester: llaskin: this through BMP?
[2013-06-26 07:09:27] Guest93852: AutomatedTester: Got it! Thanks!
[2013-06-26 07:09:54] AutomatedTester: llaskin: could the first call be a HEAD and the 2nd a GET?
[2013-06-26 07:10:04] Dave_B_: millenium: Its not ideal but its easy to extend RemoteWebDriver to take screenshots
[2013-06-26 07:10:21] AutomatedTester: Dave_B_: why?
[2013-06-26 07:10:43] *AutomatedTester thinks it should or at least give a mechanism to get a screenshot'
[2013-06-26 07:10:46] llaskin: AutomatedTester: not through BMP
[2013-06-26 07:10:46] llaskin: just striaght get
[2013-06-26 07:10:49] llaskin: i'm hitting a single pixel page(that simulates a pixel coming into our system from anotehr site), and somehow am getting 2 clicks instead of 1
[2013-06-26 07:10:50] Dave_B_: well it'd be nicer to not have to :p maybe there is a good reason to have it the way it is, I was mostly being sympathetic
[2013-06-26 07:11:06] AutomatedTester: how else would you get screenshot if using grid?

[2013-06-26 07:11:26] millenium: Dave_B_ yes I just did it and I had to modify few layers of services (from driver services to specflow) just I'm asking before commit my "wild" code :D
[2013-06-26 07:11:26] Dave_B_: I've extended my RemoteWebDriver to allow it
[2013-06-26 07:11:26] nicegraham: anyone using BMP on a grid? are you running one instance per node or a central one? and if per node... how are you adding it as a proxy before the session has been created?

[2013-06-26 07:14:06] AutomatedTester: nicegraham: he was working with infosec to set something up
[2013-06-26 07:14:27] Dave_B_: millenium: I don't know if there will be implementation soon without having to extending
[2013-06-26 07:14:39] nicegraham: interesting, I'll try and catch him later
[2013-06-26 07:14:41] millenium: Dave_B_ well I come to this ugly moment ... if(driver.GetType() == typeof(RemoteWebDriverExtender)) {return remoteWebDriver.ExecuteScreenShotCommand()} else{return ((ITakesScreenshot)driver).GetScreenshot()}
[2013-06-26 07:15:02] millenium: still our tests need to be runned on local machines with standard webdrivers

[2013-06-26 07:27:10] millenium: Java have the reaches API if I don't mistake

[2013-06-26 07:27:31] ibl: Guest93852: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ i used this
[2013-06-26 07:28:08] Dave_B_: Guest93852: moved into writing actual tests pretty quickly though, most stuff is fine to do with rudimentary language knowledge and as you learn more you can go back and refactor rather than trying to become an expert first

[2013-06-26 07:32:50] AutomatedTester: millenium: nicegraham could probably answer that
[2013-06-26 07:33:07] nicegraham: I haven't tried
[2013-06-26 07:33:21] nicegraham: but there's no reason it wouldn't assuming you have the prerequisites for it
[2013-06-26 07:33:39] nicegraham: currently that's only really xcode
[2013-06-26 07:33:48] nicegraham: and some folders etc
[2013-06-26 07:34:03] nicegraham: but assuming you can run osx and xcode you should be golden

[2013-06-26 08:55:41] peshom: Haha! I guess you would be a good person to talk to about it AutomatedTester
[2013-06-26 08:55:43] AutomatedTester: the communication goes through RemoteWebDriver via a protocol called the JSONWireProtocol

[2013-06-26 08:56:24] peshom: But if I only need to run local scripts, I don't need to be concerned about the RemoteWebDriver, yes?
[2013-06-26 08:56:44] AutomatedTester: no since everything is essentially a RemoteWebDriver
[2013-06-26 08:57:00] AutomatedTester: its a slightly overloaded term

[2013-06-26 11:17:53] peshom: not only I am new to Selenium but also to Python. So if webdriver.ie did not work, but webdriver.Ie works, am I correct in assuming that Python is case sensitive?

[2013-06-26 11:20:01] Dude-X: though you'd think that if programmers are "lazy" they would make symbols case insensitive
[2013-06-26 11:20:42] peshom: Got it... Isn't AutoIt not case sensitive either? I might be wrong.
[2013-06-26 11:20:43] barancev: llaskin: fortran is a modern one :)

[2013-06-26 14:44:47] Phasze: now just need a way to view registered nodes/browsers
[2013-06-26 14:44:56] Phasze: of which I assume you have in your github?
[2013-06-26 14:44:59] Phasze: nacegraham
[2013-06-26 14:45:03] Phasze: nicegraham*
[2013-06-26 14:45:08] nicegraham: Yeah, there's no way to do that
[2013-06-26 14:45:11] Phasze: hmmm
[2013-06-26 14:45:15] nicegraham: Just get a single node
[2013-06-26 14:45:16] Phasze: how does /grid/console do that?
[2013-06-26 14:45:27] nicegraham: It's a servlet
[2013-06-26 14:45:41] nicegraham: So the ones in my repo do something similar
[2013-06-26 14:46:00] nicegraham: But there's no api endpoint to return all proxies
[2013-06-26 14:46:14] Phasze: hmm, is there one to check if a browser is currently available?
[2013-06-26 14:46:47] nicegraham: Not out of the box, that would need to use a matcher really
[2013-06-26 14:46:56] nicegraham: If you want to do that in the hub
[2013-06-26 14:47:21] nicegraham: Otherwise, grab everything available and then match it yourself. That's what we do.
[2013-06-26 14:47:54] nicegraham: We only queue tests to the grid if there's a matching os / browse available

[2013-06-26 14:48:04] Phasze: hmm, so I would have to use a custom servlet then or just parse grid/console for it
[2013-06-26 14:48:28] nicegraham: Yeah, or what I said above :-)
[2013-06-26 14:49:00] Phasze: I don't really have a good way of matching it myself without manually configuring it
[2013-06-26 14:49:46] Phasze: What I want to do is what you have done actually hehe, only queue tests up if there is a browser available
[2013-06-26 14:50:51] Phasze: since if I have 5 tests running at once and at some point two want to use IE10 and only 1 IE10 instance if available I want my test to continue with another browser instead of waiting for the other to complete on IE10
[2013-06-26 14:52:03] nicegraham: Yeah that's exactly what we do

[2013-06-26 14:53:17] nicegraham: It's s basic check
[2013-06-26 14:53:43] nicegraham: One of those sevlets groups them by busy and free

[2013-06-26 14:54:26] Phasze: yeah, I just need to get that free list at this point
[2013-06-26 14:54:42] nicegraham: Well that's there, something like jsonbystatusservlet

[2013-06-26 19:05:08] spyder: why not just install firefox?
[2013-06-26 19:05:28] spacebat: I will
[2013-06-26 19:05:36] spyder: btw anyone have any insight on my question: if I click on a button that executes some javascript that updates the page, will this be reflected in driver.page_source ?
[2013-06-26 19:05:38] spacebat: just wondering how this all comes together
[2013-06-26 19:06:07] spacebat: there's also the version 1 vs 2 rift, seems most perl modules expect v1
[2013-06-26 19:06:31] spacebat: but saucelabs use Selenium::Remote::Driver which I assume is v2
[2013-06-26 19:06:34] spyder: spacebat, the best way to get started is to installed selenium ide for firefox, record your browsing, and export it to w.e language you are working on

[2013-06-26 19:06:57] DarkRift: iceweasel is kinda supported though with https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=d044c13e8b01

[2013-06-26 19:07:11] DarkRift: Selenium::Remote::Driver is v2 afaik
[2013-06-26 19:07:26] spacebat: I don't mind installing firefox, will try that approach spyder

[2013-06-26 19:10:45] spyder: So, js that execures on a page and alters some html, if this is not reflected on driver.page_source, where can I find out what the js did (in terms of what html it spit out)?
[2013-06-26 19:10:55] spyder: executes*

[2013-06-26 19:18:58] DarkRift: if you could get rid of v1, I would do so as it is not maintained anymore. I see no other problem if you run them on different ports
[2013-06-26 19:20:01] spacebat: oh, the docs say its in maintenance mode
[2013-06-26 19:20:01] merrihew: Does anyone know if there is a known issue with choosing an option from a select input field over the JSON wire protocol?
[2013-06-26 19:20:51] spacebat: cool - its just that there's a bunch of testing modules on the CPAN that use v1
[2013-06-26 19:22:15] DarkRift: merrihew, I just listened to GTAC 2013, and one of the presenters talked about having that kind of issue, might want to take a look on the bug tracker to see if it has been opened and/or resolved

[2013-06-26 19:23:08] merrihew: DarkRift That would be hilarious, I've been fighting with it for hours. Is there just one bug tracker for Selenium, or separate for the wire protocol?
[2013-06-26 19:24:00] DarkRift: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list
[2013-06-26 19:25:31] ryanpetrello, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-06-26 19:25:33] DarkRift: the wire protocol is just the specification of the commands, the implementation is handled by the different browsers and via the automation atoms scripts. The problem would be more in the implementation than in the wire protocol spec

[2013-06-26 19:27:31] merrihew: DarkRift Thanks.
[2013-06-26 19:27:52] DarkRift: np
[2013-06-26 19:28:41] spacebat: I installed firefox and it seems to have autodetected it
[2013-06-26 19:28:44] merrihew: It seems as though the triggering of a <select> element halts execution. I have tried looping through options, triggering clicks on options by assigning IDs, sending keystrokes, sending a click event to another element on the page.

[2013-06-26 19:29:52] DarkRift: the thing with a select element is that it's a native selection box ... that might be the problem
[2013-06-26 19:30:09] DarkRift: in java there is a helper class to handle that element
[2013-06-26 19:30:39] merrihew: Right. I'm doing everything via web driver. WD doesn't seem to have the Select helper yet.
[2013-06-26 19:31:00] DarkRift: heuu web driver is only the version of selenium. Which language is most important
[2013-06-26 19:31:15] DarkRift: webdriver = selenium v2
[2013-06-26 19:32:25] noahsussman, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-06-26 19:32:53] DarkRift: or you mean, you are doing the wire protocol calls yourself ?
[2013-06-26 19:32:58] merrihew: I'm running using a Node library over the JWP.
[2013-06-26 19:33:25] DarkRift: give me 2 seconds, I'll see what the Select helper class does
[2013-06-26 19:33:36] merrihew: And I cannot seem to find any method that natively handles selects on here https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol
[2013-06-26 19:34:02] nirvdrum, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-26 19:36:24] DarkRift: ok so what the Select helper class does when you want to select the item by index, is retrieve all the options element, and click on the nth option
[2013-06-26 19:36:25] DarkRift: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/Select.java

[2013-06-26 19:37:43] merrihew: That is exactly what I need. But I can't figure out why I don't see this option listed in the JWP documentation.
[2013-06-26 19:38:24] DarkRift: what JWP documentation ?
[2013-06-26 19:38:29] DarkRift: the wire protocol ?
[2013-06-26 19:38:35] merrihew: Right

[2013-06-26 19:41:38] merrihew: And that's where I'm stuck. Selenium does not respond to the request to click the proper option. I grab the select, click to open it, grab its descendent options, loop through the options to find the one I want, and then trigger a click on that element. Nothing happens.
[2013-06-26 19:42:30] merrihew: Additionally, triggering the select to open seems to stop (Chrome, at least) from responding to any further events.
[2013-06-26 19:43:22] DarkRift: don't trigger the select
[2013-06-26 19:43:29] DarkRift: click on the option directly
[2013-06-26 19:43:46] DarkRift: and not the select before it

[2013-06-26 19:46:18] merrihew: DarkRift Wow. I feel like a complete idiot. That did it.
[2013-06-26 19:46:32] DarkRift: Glad I was able to help
[2013-06-26 19:46:37] merrihew: I didn't think you could trigger a click on the descendent options if they weren't visible
[2013-06-26 19:46:52] merrihew: Thank you so much. Sorry for all the back and forth. Much appreciated.
[2013-06-26 19:46:54] DarkRift: I thought so too until I looked at the helper class
[2013-06-26 19:47:03] DarkRift: might be a special case for select options
