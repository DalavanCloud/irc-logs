[2013-06-18 05:24:00] jimevans: it's a capability called requireWindowFocus. it should have a defined constant in the latest java and .NET bindings (though i'm too lazy to look it up right now)

[2013-06-18 06:28:42] dimacus: damn itâ€¦ i guess i'll have to learn c++ once i finish with javaâ€¦ this way i'll try to fix bugs that creep up

[2013-06-18 06:34:16] dimacus: hehe
[2013-06-18 06:34:41] jimevans: though they call into a compiled (in C) dll at the bottom of the stack
[2013-06-18 06:35:00] dimacus: no easy way to reach into that?
[2013-06-18 06:35:16] txwikinger, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-18 06:35:24] jimevans: but looking at the behaviour of coded ui tests, it acts like they're using SendInput in their lowest-level code.
[2013-06-18 06:35:31] jimevans: not without the source cod.e
[2013-06-18 06:36:25] nirvdrum, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-18 06:36:40] dimacus: do you have access to SendInput?
[2013-06-18 06:36:46] dimacus: or is that a private api
[2013-06-18 06:36:53] jimevans: SendInput is a documented windows API.
[2013-06-18 06:37:00] jimevans: we *do* use it.
[2013-06-18 06:37:16] jimevans: when you add requireWindowFocus as a capability for the IE driver.
[2013-06-18 06:37:54] *dimacus feels like an IE noob'
[2013-06-18 06:38:10] jimevans: the challenge is, SendInput acts at a very *very* low level.
[2013-06-18 06:38:12] barancev, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-18 06:39:00] jimevans: so low, that keyboard and mouse events get shoved into the system-wide keyboard and mouse event queues, which means that whatever window has the focus is the one that gets the keyboard or mouse events.
[2013-06-18 06:39:30] dimacus: which proves tricky on multi browser runs
[2013-06-18 06:39:37] txwikinger, quitting. (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[2013-06-18 06:39:37] jimevans: indeed.
[2013-06-18 06:39:46] dimacus: what if you do small vms 1 browser per test?
[2013-06-18 06:39:54] jimevans: that'd be ideal.
[2013-06-18 06:40:10] dimacus: i wonder if it's possible to get something simple like rasbery pi
[2013-06-18 06:40:19] dimacus: 1 browser mini machine
[2013-06-18 06:40:25] dimacus: that would help to scale
[2013-06-18 06:40:40] dimacus: b/c right now i'm wasting 2GB of RAM on a vm per browser
[2013-06-18 06:40:49] dimacus: just to run IE :-/
[2013-06-18 06:40:59] jimevans: dimacus: problem is that IE is a pig. you need that much memory.

[2013-06-18 06:52:50] jimevans: initial verdict on my talk. needed to rehearse a bit more, but did a passable job.
[2013-06-18 06:52:59] dimacus: no you did well
[2013-06-18 06:53:08] dimacus: i liked it, you were natural

[2013-06-18 06:53:39] jimevans: i wanted to make it entertaining, and have a bit of a narrative, rather than just dry technical details.
[2013-06-18 06:53:54] jimevans: to me, that helps it be more memorable.

[2013-06-18 09:06:44] Dude-X: handrus: describe the problem
[2013-06-18 09:06:46] handrus: How can I set up the timeout for a page load so selenium would close the browser and go to the next test?
[2013-06-18 09:07:33] handrus: Dude-X, I have just 2 steps, open a page and than take a screenshot. Another tool will than compare previous screenshots of that page...
[2013-06-18 09:07:55] handrus: but for a specific website the page never stops loading, and my tests get stuck
[2013-06-18 09:08:20] Dude-X: you can set a capability on the profile to use the fast load strategy in firefox
[2013-06-18 09:08:36] Dude-X: there is something in the docs about setting that.
[2013-06-18 09:08:39] handrus: in my case it is happening on IE8

[2013-06-18 09:10:56] jimevans: IE8 doesn't have that capability, but you can set a page load timeout, catch the timeout exception and go along your merry way.
[2013-06-18 09:11:17] handrus: All I want is my hub to skip this test and follow the others on the queue

[2013-06-18 09:12:17] stephend, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-18 09:13:35] jimevans: handrus: so, set the page load timeout [driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout() in java], and catch the timeout exception.

[2013-06-18 12:29:56] arex\: for front-end i've looked at webpagetest(.org) and dynaTrace AJAX Edition - both decent except for reporting... i can look at results for one test session, but not look at results over time to track progress/regressions

[2013-06-18 12:34:01] eghm: rdarcy: is that the Appplication Aware network monitoring?

[2013-06-18 19:02:05] rdarcy: how to make an automator realize they should focus on manual testing rather than automation, for lack of skills
[2013-06-18 19:02:20] llaskin:  :(
[2013-06-18 19:02:22] llaskin: thats tough
[2013-06-18 19:02:24] llaskin: without demoting them
[2013-06-18 19:02:30] rdarcy: yes
[2013-06-18 19:02:31] llaskin: and I would reapidly expect them to quit...
[2013-06-18 19:02:43] rdarcy: but they know the product
[2013-06-18 19:02:55] llaskin: yea but they will stil quit:(
[2013-06-18 19:02:55] rdarcy: just not how to code (after 2 years)
[2013-06-18 19:02:59] llaskin: :(
[2013-06-18 19:03:27] tinygeo, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-06-18 19:03:58] llaskin: if you tell someone they can't code, they will quit and go elsewhere
[2013-06-18 19:04:13] rdarcy: Mentoring has not worked, I have moved a manual tester, up and in 6 months has surpassed this person
[2013-06-18 19:04:19] llaskin: :(
[2013-06-18 19:04:32] llaskin: we are interviewing people...and their resumes include things like multiple languages, selenium, etc
[2013-06-18 19:04:34] llaskin: i ask them to find me an element
[2013-06-18 19:04:36] llaskin: they fall over
[2013-06-18 19:04:43] llaskin: so i neg every one of them
[2013-06-18 19:04:55] rdarcy: how do you creatively let them know their avenue is not coding
[2013-06-18 19:05:01] llaskin: i don't hire them
[2013-06-18 19:05:04] rdarcy: lmao
[2013-06-18 19:05:09] llaskin: :)
[2013-06-18 19:05:13] llaskin: no but seriously
[2013-06-18 19:05:17] riv_, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-06-18 19:05:21] rdarcy: unfortunately I did not hire this one
[2013-06-18 19:05:32] llaskin: we have 1 qa person who is a BAD qa person...he's just negative and sadly he was brought on by the current VPEng
[2013-06-18 19:05:34] llaskin: i can't get rid of him
[2013-06-18 19:05:36] rdarcy: I just have to constantly mentor
[2013-06-18 19:05:47] llaskin: then there is me(i do automation and some manual)
[2013-06-18 19:05:52] rdarcy: I feel your pain
[2013-06-18 19:05:55] llaskin: and we have 1 manual guy who is AMAZING, but would be a better automator
[2013-06-18 19:06:01] llaskin: who can actually code better then me IMO
[2013-06-18 19:06:07] llaskin: but just isn't given time
[2013-06-18 19:06:07] rdarcy: lol
[2013-06-18 19:06:11] llaskin: we also let him move back to Belarus
[2013-06-18 19:06:21] llaskin: I told my boss if they didn't keep him when he moved home ot take care of his sick mother, that I'd quit on the spot
[2013-06-18 19:06:34] llaskin: ...they kept him
[2013-06-18 19:06:41] rdarcy: that is value
[2013-06-18 19:06:54] rdarcy: so they let him work remote
[2013-06-18 19:07:00] rdarcy: that is awesome
[2013-06-18 19:07:02] llaskin: yea
[2013-06-18 19:07:07] llaskin: they don't let me work remote
[2013-06-18 19:07:08] llaskin: they do let him

[2013-06-18 19:19:25] llaskin: rdarcy: we have a culture of not allowing w@h:(
[2013-06-18 19:19:33] llaskin: jrock20041: ...what does that have to do with selenium?
[2013-06-18 19:20:10] jrock20041: llaskin: well the surefire report is generated based on my selenium tests.
[2013-06-18 19:20:14] llaskin: the only excuse to W@H is a legit reason...its never a daily thing
[2013-06-18 19:20:44] jrock20041: llaskin: I agree this has nothing to really do with selenium but thought I would ask here to see if anyone has dealt with it
[2013-06-18 19:21:37] llaskin: sorry, you're in a bad time for people
[2013-06-18 19:21:41] llaskin: noone is really here

[2013-06-18 19:22:01] jrock20041: Understood
[2013-06-18 19:22:40] llaskin: why are you trying to override the surefire plugin?  what does that have to do with a better looking report?
[2013-06-18 19:23:52] jrock20041: Well I would like the rearrange the layout. I want to add some additonal content for the test results

[2013-06-18 19:27:24] llaskin: ok but thats a coding problem..not a selenium issue(once again)...what is your issue like?

[2013-06-18 19:31:50] rdarcy: and you can always include an HTML report for stacktraces and such
[2013-06-18 19:32:04] jrock20041: llaskin: I know this is not a selenium issue
