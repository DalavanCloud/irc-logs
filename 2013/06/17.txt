We are using Selenium with WebDriver for Firefox 10.0.7ESR (according to http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/faq/ this is Firefox 17) Which Version should I enter for DesiredCapabilities, and what are the implications, if there is a wrong version entered?
[2013-06-17 02:47:32] Ardesco: and it is the firefox binary and not a script?
[2013-06-17 02:47:39] Ardesco: and the permission are set up correctly

[2013-06-17 02:52:03] srm: ah, you mean 17.0.6esr because it's the latest release from 10.0.7 ? Got this :)
[2013-06-17 02:53:36] srm: Ardesco: sorry, mixed that up. You are perfectly right. Version shows 17.0.6 - anyhow, what's the correct version for DesiredCapabilities? 10, 17 or a minor version?
[2013-06-17 02:54:20] Ardesco: you don't need to set the version in desired capabilities
[2013-06-17 02:55:14] srm: Ok, what's that field for then?

[2013-06-17 03:01:45] Ardesco: so you can query it to get the version of the browser currently running

[2013-06-17 03:02:01] Ardesco: in fact I should probably ask what you are trying to set

[2013-06-17 03:03:18] Ardesco: in selenium you can only get cookies that are visible to you by doing a document.cookie in the JavaScript console
[2013-06-17 03:03:23] Ardesco: it's not aware of any others
[2013-06-17 03:04:00] deanrock: is it possible to get path to temporary profile? that way i could read firefox cookie file
[2013-06-17 03:04:05] Ardesco: unless one of the drivers has implemented something that hooks into lower levels of the browser
[2013-06-17 03:05:08] Ardesco: not sure off the top of my head
[2013-06-17 03:05:10] *Ardesco has look'
[2013-06-17 03:05:45] srm: Ardesco: We have trouble with Selenium and WebDriver and Timouts when asking for visibility or availability of elements in our Ajax page (Wicket Backend). So I'm trying to figure out what may be wrong and I just stumbled across our setup code, that initializes the WebDriver for firefox and sets the Version field to 7 in desired capabilities. Rather old code, but that triggered me.
[2013-06-17 03:06:42] Ardesco: can you show me the line that sets the version so i can checks it's what I think it is
[2013-06-17 03:07:43] srm: Ardesco: capabilities.setCapability(CapabilityType.VERSION, "7");
[2013-06-17 03:08:07] Ardesco: in that case you don't need to do that
[2013-06-17 03:08:16] Ardesco: that capability is set when the driver is instantiated
[2013-06-17 03:08:25] Ardesco: so you know what version of firefox you are running
[2013-06-17 03:08:58] ddary, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-06-17 03:11:33] srm: hm. So the WebDriver figures the version by itself when starting the WebDriver? Map<String, Object> rawCapabilities = (Map<String, Object>) response.getValue(); ?

[2013-06-17 07:46:30] depoel: Hey guys, I feel limited by what IDE can do, would it be a good idea to move onto coding tests for webdriver? Thing is I don't know java, I do know PHP, can PHP be used to write tests for web driver?
[2013-06-17 07:50:49] depoel: I am using IDE, export to PHP, run with PHPunit via command line
[2013-06-17 07:51:04] depoel: Maintaining tests is just horrible this way
[2013-06-17 07:51:59] riv: depoel: yes webdriver can be used to write tests in PHP but the PHP bindings are not officially supported by the selenium team i think .... java, c#, ruby and python are the officially supported ones
[2013-06-17 07:53:40] riv: i dont use PHP so I cant give you much info I use JAVA ... also IDE will go away in some months ... its best to start using selenium builder http://sebuilder.github.io/se-builder/
[2013-06-17 07:54:36] depoel: Yeah I have got that installed, but didn't know IDE was going? how come?

[2013-06-17 10:44:20] zx29b: with rspecâ€¦the confusing part is that if I do this via command ilne (pry) it works fine
[2013-06-17 10:44:28] zx29b: only rspec barfs it up
[2013-06-17 10:44:43] lukeis: redhawk: all it does is launch a process and forward on to itâ€¦ namely chromedriver
[2013-06-17 10:45:00] zx29b: nothing bizarre in my setup.rb fileâ€¦driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox
[2013-06-17 10:45:24] zx29b: did that in pry and it worked fine when I do driver.get("http://www.google.com")
[2013-06-17 10:45:52] zx29b: when rspec tires to do the same thing in my simple test stub, it hangs and gives me "unable to obtain stable firefox connection in 60 seconds"
[2013-06-17 10:45:56] jimevans: nirvdrum: i'm kinda ambivalent about it. i guess i could see its use, but i think there are better tools (as you so rightly point out)
[2013-06-17 10:45:58] redhawk: lukeis: do I need the chromedriver to get it to work?  I have tried running the selenium jar with just chrome installed and it works fine on windows 2003
[2013-06-17 10:46:16] lukeis: redhawk: that means you're running Selenium RC?
[2013-06-17 10:46:31] nirvdrum: jimevans: Well, to be fair, we told people to use BMP for this for a long time and it just didn't work :-P
[2013-06-17 10:47:10] redhawk: lukeis: yeah, I am using the selenium-server-standalone-2.32.0.jar file
[2013-06-17 10:47:17] nirvdrum: BMP use can get gnarly in grid.  And it's downright unusable if you'd like to try to run multiple IE or Safari instances.
[2013-06-17 10:47:27] jimevans: nirvdrum: it also didn't help that RC acted as a proxy in some cases, and had its captureNetworkTraffic() method.

[2013-06-17 10:47:49] lukeis: redhawk: the standalone server contains both RC and WebDriver api'sâ€¦ if you use RC you don't need chromedriverâ€¦ if you use WebDriver you DO need chromedriver
[2013-06-17 10:48:07] jimevans: nirvdrum: true, but that's also a browser architecture limitation, to a certain degree. at least in the case of IE it is.

[2013-06-17 10:48:53] nirvdrum: jimevans: Sure.  But as an ActiveX control or BHO you can do process isolation of your memory.  So you can do things that you couldn't achieve with a shared proxy setting.  As shitty as that is.
[2013-06-17 10:49:23] *jimevans sighs heavily'
[2013-06-17 10:49:28] redhawk: lukeis: oh ok.  That makes more sense.  Thanks for clearing that up!  What I am having an issue with is when running a selenium test on windows 7 as the local system user, I get a selenium WindowsRegistryError.
[2013-06-17 10:49:45] jimevans: i thought strongly about implementing the IE driver as a bho.
[2013-06-17 10:49:52] davidlai: don't you need chromedriver since RC bindings is just a wrapper for SeleniumBackedWebdriver?
[2013-06-17 10:49:57] nirvdrum: jimevans: Of course, there's no  guarantee other browsers implement similar semantics.  So you could have the inverse problem.
[2013-06-17 10:50:28] jimevans: davidlai: no, RC is its own thing.
[2013-06-17 10:51:33] lukeis: redhawk: if you use WebDriver, i may be able to help (still not entirely likely on windowsâ€¦ but at least others could here). For RC, I'm afraid I can't help and not many others will be able to either
[2013-06-17 10:51:40] nirvdrum: jimevans: I just loathe when people argue "you don't do the one thing I want and that's the 99% use case."

[2013-06-17 10:53:43] redhawk: lukeis: ok, thanks!  I have a suspicion its less a question about selenium RC/WebDriver as its a problem with selenium not finding chrome or something...
[2013-06-17 10:53:52] nirvdrum: lukeis: I'm not sure that's legal.
[2013-06-17 10:54:29] lukeis: redhawk: it's likely an RC problemâ€¦ webdriver / chromedriver doesn't seem to have issues (that I'm aware of)

[2013-06-17 10:59:43] Oscar: what do you mean test stub?
[2013-06-17 10:59:43] nirvdrum: My guess is it can't find your Firefox installation.  Is it just /Applications/Firefox.app ?

[2013-06-17 11:11:55] nirvdrum: zx29b: This would be weird, but if the stack ends up screwing with the DISPLAY variable, that could cause the browser to spawn, but crash.

[2013-06-17 11:15:52] jimevans: barancev: the IE driver code for getting element location is a very *very* thin wrapper around the getLocation atom. thus, in order to get rid of those failures in CI is to get a test in the atoms so the atoms can be fixed.

[2013-06-17 12:09:29] Phasze: lukeis: you mentioned at the SeConf that salesforce tries not to test the same thing twice (such as login).  My question is how are you accessing your site which requires login info without logging in?
[2013-06-17 12:09:42] rdarcy: I have not seen the slides, but the videos are up on you tube and accessable from the seconf
[2013-06-17 12:09:49] rdarcy: site
[2013-06-17 12:10:22] lukeis: Phasze: by authenticating with and API first (just straight http requests) and then setting a cookie in the browser that is the SessionID
[2013-06-17 12:11:20] lukeis: also one could log in once for a given user, then re-use the SessionID cookie (if they don't have an API exposed for it)

[2013-06-17 12:12:22] Phasze: hehe, we just started supporting REST as well
[2013-06-17 12:13:04] lukeis: REST is cross language friendlyâ€¦ also much easier for me to hack on in a python interpretter
[2013-06-17 12:13:22] manoj9788: glad to see some keen observers, was thinking to ask lukeis the same.
