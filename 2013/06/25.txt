[2013-06-25 12:37:44] AutomatedTester: woah...

[2013-06-25 13:37:52] AutomatedTester: zx29b: that will be in October
[2013-06-25 13:37:55] pianoroy: I have a boat load of Selenium IDE (html) tests, currently being run (programmatically) with SeleniumRC and FireFox. Is it possible to run these in PhantomJS instead (perhaps via WebDriver)?
[2013-06-25 13:38:13] migfrade: pianoroy, I tried storeEval, but how do I check the contents of the javascript? For instance, if I have var s = runSomeFunction(), how do I verify the contents of s? What's the verify command I need to use?

[2013-06-25 13:39:20] AutomatedTester: jimevans1: its fine, there is no rush
[2013-06-25 13:39:30] migfrade: stackedsax1, I didn't use the pipe. Is that how I should use it in Selenium IDE? I just used runScript in the Command, the script itself was in Value, enclosed within javascript{} and Target was empty

[2013-06-25 13:40:49] stackedsax1: migfrade: try the syntax I pasted.  runScript | javascript{alert('hi');}       it's been a long time, I can't remember exactly.
[2013-06-25 13:40:57] pianoroy: migfrade: like this - verifyEval | javascript{runSomeFunction()} | 10

[2013-06-25 13:41:30] AutomatedTester: zx29b: the story behind it is was I was asked to keynote. So, since its a keynote for pycon I wanted to step outside of my usual talk subjects and asked a number of people in Mozilla what I should talk about. The recurring theme was how poor the testing is in the python community as a whole
[2013-06-25 13:41:31] stackedsax1: migfrade: or pianoroy's verifyEval, sure.  but I think those pipes are necessary

[2013-06-25 13:43:21] AutomatedTester: stackedsax1: but ironically, being the maintainer of the selenium bindings I should interact more with them
[2013-06-25 13:43:38] pianoroy: migfrade: so in "someCommand | arg1 | arg2", arg1 and arg2 are the arguments passed to someCommand in Selenese

[2013-06-25 13:44:49] jimevans: jleyba: well, to be fair, it may be something else, but everything was green/yellow for the java tests until a commit, which following up the commit tree, was your commit. :)
[2013-06-25 13:44:51] migfrade: pianoroy, I tried putting this in, and am now getting an error like this: [error] Unexpected Exception: fileName -> chrome://selenium-ide/content/selenium-core/scripts/selenium-api.js, lineNumber -> 2535, columnNumber -> 0
[2013-06-25 13:45:23] AutomatedTester: stackedsax1: indigenous is a relative term ;)
[2013-06-25 13:45:52] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I will post the blog tomorrow morning my time
[2013-06-25 13:46:13] pianoroy: Is it possible to run Selenese (html) tests using WebDriver?
[2013-06-25 13:46:15] AutomatedTester: get full affect on the Europeans and retweet when west coasters come on lime
[2013-06-25 13:46:29] jimevans: AutomatedTester: brilliant. there ought to be a fair number of comments by the time i get online tomorroe.
[2013-06-25 13:46:33] AutomatedTester: pianoroy: if we get builder finished then yes
[2013-06-25 13:46:38] migfrade: I suppose I could try, but was giving Selenium IDE the first shot
[2013-06-25 13:46:39] AutomatedTester: jimevans: we'll see
[2013-06-25 13:46:49] stackedsax1: speaking of events, there is this next week for Bay Area folk: http://www.eventbrite.com/event/7230826597
[2013-06-25 13:46:51] jimevans: AutomatedTester: simonstewart already had a shot on his.
[2013-06-25 13:46:52] zx29b: stackedsax1: you are SOOOOO not the person to be discussing "indigenous" LOL
[2013-06-25 13:47:15] stackedsax1: zx29b: I am indignantly indigenous.
[2013-06-25 13:47:25] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I know, but I had started mine before his so should let it lose
[2013-06-25 13:47:30] zx29b: stackedsax1: Yes, but to WHERE!!!!!
[2013-06-25 13:47:36] AutomatedTester: jimevans: plus Simon has to play nice, I dont :D
[2013-06-25 13:47:43] stackedsax1: that eventbrite link is for an appium hackathon in SF

[2013-06-25 13:48:16] jimevans: stackedsax1: sorry mate, i'll be gone by then. :)
[2013-06-25 13:48:26] zx29b: stackedsax1: There is no such thing as an indigenous British, redneck Marin-ite

[2013-06-25 13:52:52] jimevans: AutomatedTester: no, you're right. i was exaggerating for dramatic effect. though it *is* pretty bad.
[2013-06-25 13:53:06] AutomatedTester: Val Kilmer in The Saint
[2013-06-25 13:53:16] AutomatedTester: zomg, he needed to be shot for that
[2013-06-25 13:53:35] zx29b: jimevans, AutomatedTester: backstory…Alex is British and yet also a northern Bay area Marin-ite, yet also almost a redneck having lived in the Sierra Foothills.  When I asked him why he confused things by telling people he was from San Rafael instead of saying "I was born in London…blah blah blah".  It was due to people then launching into terrible British accents, so he claims.  So now I torture him with THAT video
[2013-06-25 13:53:53] migfrade: pianoroy, any ideas? Shouldn't verifyEval work with the code in http://pastebin.com/hBVYyAPk
[2013-06-25 13:54:15] AutomatedTester: zx29b: lol
[2013-06-25 13:54:32] AutomatedTester: the worst accent of all time is Leonardo DiCaprio in Blood Diamond
[2013-06-25 13:54:35] zx29b: and yes AutomatedTester all of Val Kilmer's accents in that movie were bad…but DVanD still holds the medal

[2013-06-25 13:55:18] zx29b: AutomatedTester: for all around crap accent…yes…but for worst Brit (cockney) accent…DVD has to be the worst
[2013-06-25 13:55:19] AutomatedTester: he is supposedly South African but in one sentence he went dutch, english, mexican and american

[2013-06-25 13:58:53] jimevans: zx29b: selbot always says simonstewart broke the build. :)
[2013-06-25 13:59:22] zx29b: as it should since it is ultimately his fault (since we live in a culture of victimhood and need someone to blame)
[2013-06-25 13:59:30] zx29b: jimevans: :)
[2013-06-25 13:59:52] migfrade: pianoroy, that's the page I'm loading - it is nearly blank except for the function whoami(). I am loading it from the Selenium IDE
[2013-06-25 14:01:20] pianoroy: migfrade: try getting something simpler working first: how about "verifyEval | javascript{2+2} | 4"
