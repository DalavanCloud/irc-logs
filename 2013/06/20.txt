[2013-06-20 01:05:10] juri`: Hello, does anyone have experience with WebDriver+IE?
[2013-06-20 01:09:54] asavchuk: juri`: hi! yes. what's a problem?
[2013-06-20 01:11:24] jost, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-20 01:17:20] juri`: the problem is that the initial start page just stays and i cannot see the requested page's content, but somehow it's opened, because according to the iedriverserver log some data is successfully retrieved from the browser
[2013-06-20 01:17:33] juri`: the exception comes only when it tries to click on a link
[2013-06-20 01:18:28] juri`: the exactly same code just worked on another machine, but only once after booting the windows
[2013-06-20 01:19:02] juri`: i've been reading th forums all around
[2013-06-20 01:19:15] juri`: there are similar problems, but no clear soultion

[2013-06-20 01:27:59] asavchuk: juri`: initial start page is empty page or some your application page ?
[2013-06-20 01:28:19] asavchuk: juri`: how click fails when nativeEvents are on ?
[2013-06-20 01:28:22] juri`: it's default webdriver start page in case of IE
[2013-06-20 01:29:24] juri`: OpenQA.Selenium.ElementNotVisibleException: The point at which the driver is attempting to click on the element was not scrolled into the viewport.
[2013-06-20 01:29:34] juri`: with native events enabled
[2013-06-20 01:29:47] asavchuk: does enablePersistentHover=false affect this behaviour?
[2013-06-20 01:30:30] juri`: no, it does not
[2013-06-20 01:31:30] juri`: i cannot understand how is that possible, that page is not shown, but reading some texts from it is successful

[2013-06-20 01:32:22] AeroNotix: hi - it seems I can't get selenium to actually use a proxy. I can get the browsers to use a proxy but I am wanting to use webdriver.Remote with a proxy and thus I tried to start the server itself with a proxy (maybe this isn't the right thing to do)
[2013-06-20 01:34:07] Eleccy: you can define proxy settings for a Firefox driver at least
[2013-06-20 01:34:16] juri`: asavchuk, and launching the same code on another machine worked, but only once.. the second attempt gave the same failure
[2013-06-20 01:34:40] Eleccy: oh nvm

[2013-06-20 01:36:32] asavchuk: juri`: from my point of view something is wrong at machine and IE stops to redraw window but DOM model is updated correctly. what may be the reason of that i don't know, sorry

[2013-06-20 01:38:28] juri`: asavchuk, but what's ur guess why it works 1 time after rebooting system? It used to work this way (once) on my machine as well
[2013-06-20 01:38:37] juri`: IE10/Win7x64
[2013-06-20 01:38:49] juri`: both machines i've tested it on are the same

[2013-06-20 01:41:10] juri`: i think i'll try to re-install IE
[2013-06-20 01:41:38] asavchuk: oh, does this problem begins some days ago and before that it works normally ?
[2013-06-20 01:42:39] juri`: right from the start it worked only one after system boot, then it stopped working on my machine even once, but was showing "Waiting for page", today it doesn't even show the waiting message
[2013-06-20 01:42:46] juri`: once*
[2013-06-20 01:43:35] juri`: ther ewere driver/framework changes during that time, as i was playing around with them to see if that solves the problem
[2013-06-20 01:43:51] juri`: version changes, i meant

[2013-06-20 01:46:21] asavchuk: juri`: no idea why it could be. i have suspiction about latests IE10 installed at last win update (bigger than my 10.0.9200.16576) - my colleague warns me about this - it produces strange problems at simple pages.
[2013-06-20 01:46:55] asavchuk: yes, i'd recommend to reinstall IE10 (and maybe Windows too, if it's virtual ;)

You can spend days with such stuff. There are crawlers that do all that, but they can't really cope with the login on my page (RSA

[2013-06-20 08:34:53] jimevans: zx29b: i can't point to any setup stuff that you could automate to prep a windows instance for automation of IE. almost all of that stuff is in the registry, though, so you can check there for what you might need to edit.
[2013-06-20 08:35:53] jimevans: as for performance, don't use 64-bit IE. limit your use of javascript in your webdriver tests. and by that i mean limit your use of xpath for finding elements, limit your use of isDisplayed and limit your use of getText
[2013-06-20 08:35:55] zx29b: jimevans: so you manually configure a Windows server before you start running tests on it??  How does that scale?

[2013-06-20 09:31:33] p_l: OTOH, I did find out a way to deal with the page loads :3
[2013-06-20 09:31:45] jimevans: i refuse to believe it's impossible to sanitize/create from scratch an example HTML of any given problem. note that i don't say it wouldn't be without effort, maybe even more effort than the actual application being automated, but it's not an impossible task.
[2013-06-20 09:31:47] p_l: and better way, in the end, than QTP time
[2013-06-20 09:32:03] p_l: jimevans: I suspect that suitably sanitized HTML would not exhibit the problems
[2013-06-20 09:32:23] p_l: which is why I hope to never buy from certain american companies again ;)\
[2013-06-20 09:33:30] jimevans: note that by "sanitize", i don't necessarily mean "simplify".
[2013-06-20 09:33:45] p_l: we were supposed to just do the deployment of american-made software, now we are afaik more than 3 years into fixing it
[2013-06-20 09:34:13] jimevans: i mean, look, it's all html/css/javascript under the hood. an equivalent implementation will exhibit equivalent behavior.
[2013-06-20 09:34:28] jimevans: even if it doesn't have the same data associated with it.

[2013-06-20 09:42:29] jimevans: Phasze: welcome to the wonderful world of the pre-IE9 javascript engine.
[2013-06-20 09:42:32] p_l: (actually, I should work with IE7, but that's where spec and reality deviate)
[2013-06-20 09:42:54] Phasze: jimevans: can't wait to not support IE8 when microsoft dumps XP
[2013-06-20 09:43:39] p_l: Phasze: ... oh god, you just made me think of the "glorious" possible contract in updating the shit when that happens >_>
[2013-06-20 09:43:39] jimevans: Phasze: i wish i could get away with that. i'm dropping IE6 support in the IE driver on 15 April 2014.

[2013-06-20 09:48:46] Phasze: now if only IE wasn't built into the OS and we could run multiple instances at once :D

[2013-06-20 09:49:52] jimevans: asavchuk: yt?
[2013-06-20 09:50:17] asavchuk: jimevans: yes
[2013-06-20 09:50:21] jimevans: Phasze: sessions *should* be isolated in the IE driver, but there may be conditions where they're not.

[2013-06-20 09:52:07] Phasze: jimevans: would also be nice if IE8 closed properly with lightboxes leave this page prompt
[2013-06-20 09:52:16] asavchuk: jimevans: yes.
[2013-06-20 09:52:31] jimevans: the code of the IE driver is rather crappy, so probably sucks at that. (i can say it's crappy; i'm really good friends with the maintainer/author)

[2013-06-20 09:52:44] Phasze: lol
[2013-06-20 09:53:45] jimevans: Phasze: i have a test that closes IE with the "leave this page" prompt active.

[2013-06-20 10:03:44] davidlai: I'm going for a slightly different setup.  I was thinking of using Grid Extras to restart the node a particular test runs on (only that node)  The nodes themselves are not hooked up to CI, my CI setup is on bamboo which is running on unix, then requests browsers from the Grid which can be windows or mac
[2013-06-20 10:04:31] davidlai: The idea is to keep the machines not used in the test intact so another queued up test can use those while the first set of nodes are rebooting

[2013-06-20 10:58:04] lukeis: that's a silly question, just quizzing API knowlege (something that can be easily googled)
[2013-06-20 10:58:15] saml: no..
[2013-06-20 10:58:21] saml: i wasn't going to ask api questions

[2013-06-20 10:58:38] zx29b: I'm seeing some seriously slower times for FF 21 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS…I run a short test locally on my Macbook and it takes about 26 seconds.  I run it locally on Ubuntu with xvfb and it takes 38 seconds…any reason anyone can think of why this is so?
[2013-06-20 10:58:42] Dude-X: saml: simply ask them how they did things at work

[2013-06-20 10:59:53] saml: what's flakiness?
[2013-06-20 10:59:59] lukeis: basically similar questions you'd ask a dev, but just add the "in tests" at the end ;)

[2013-06-20 11:07:34] lukeis: i think so
[2013-06-20 11:10:00] zx29b: lukeis: you know anything about FF + Ubuntu slowness
[2013-06-20 11:10:10] lukeis: nope
[2013-06-20 11:10:40] Dude-X: zx29b: what do you mean about slowness?
[2013-06-20 11:10:40] lukeis: it would be better to narrow down what you think is slow
[2013-06-20 11:11:57] zx29b: I benchmark against my local Macbook.  I run a small test that does a "Hello World" search against Google, then clicks on and through a bunch of links through Wikipedia.  On my Mac, using FF 21, it runs in about 27 seconds, which is comparable to what it takes Chrome to run, again locally on my Macbook
[2013-06-20 11:12:48] zx29b: When I run locally from an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS machine, Chrome once again takes about 26 seconds, but FF consistently takes about 38 seconds, so approximately 50% longer
[2013-06-20 11:13:03] manoj9788: simonstewart might be on a Vacation :) lukeis
[2013-06-20 11:13:19] lukeis: zx29b: can you narrow it down more? and eliminate browser startup in the timing

[2013-06-20 11:15:22] zx29b: lukeis: since I'm running "headless" it is difficult to "see" if browser startup is the issue…any suggestions how one goes about, from the command line, determining how long each step is taking when using Rspec to run tests written in Ruby?
[2013-06-20 11:16:18] lukeis: start time = now();    do x;  logTimeDelata();  do y; logTimeDelta();  do z.....
[2013-06-20 11:16:20] zx29b: from a purely anecdotal perspective, I can see that each test step takes a little longer to report success or failure when usin gFF
[2013-06-20 11:16:48] lukeis: i no know ruby ;)
[2013-06-20 11:17:09] zx29b: lukeis: sure, knew that, but yeah, I guess I can futz with this test to report time deltas
[2013-06-20 11:17:28] zx29b: will take some time hahahah
[2013-06-20 11:17:46] zx29b: and then run it against IE and get a good laugh

[2013-06-20 15:45:31] krys: can I use selenium at my commercial software?
[2013-06-20 15:45:43] lukeis: yes
[2013-06-20 15:45:51] Dude-X: is your commercial software a web application, then yes you can
[2013-06-20 15:45:59] krys: i also read that it has paid version
[2013-06-20 15:46:02] jimevans: krys: i am not a lawyer, but selenium is very liberally licensed.
[2013-06-20 15:46:18] lukeis: paid version? wha?
[2013-06-20 15:46:41] lukeis: some people offer paid services (aka sauce labs)
[2013-06-20 15:46:42] jimevans: erm. not that i'm aware of.
[2013-06-20 15:46:59] krys: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/support/
[2013-06-20 15:47:25] lukeis: those are 'support' services or companies that will write your test automation for you, for a fee
[2013-06-20 15:47:35] lukeis: the selenium tool is free
[2013-06-20 15:47:43] krys: ok
[2013-06-20 15:47:56] krys: so it is free to use at commercail software...
[2013-06-20 15:47:59] krys: i guess
[2013-06-20 15:48:00] lukeis: yes
[2013-06-20 15:48:12] krys: and yes it is web application
[2013-06-20 15:48:25] lukeis: Apache2 license
[2013-06-20 15:48:31] krys: tired of using c# webbrowser
[2013-06-20 15:48:42] lukeis: if you at a "commercial company" have your lawyers read that license and check it for you :)
[2013-06-20 15:48:43] p_l: krys: some companies also offer hosted "selenium grid" that provides you with pre-made environments to test again (need IE8 on windows XP? sure! etc. etc.)
[2013-06-20 15:48:49] Dude-X: doesn't the new visual studio include IE Driver now?
[2013-06-20 15:49:02] jimevans: Dude-X: no. not by a long shot. :)

[2013-06-20 15:49:58] Dude-X: very well
[2013-06-20 15:50:02] jimevans: Dude-X: they recommend using the .NET bindings for executing cross-browser "coded ui tests", which is the visual studio name for their proprietary testing solution.
[2013-06-20 15:50:15] Dude-X: ah
[2013-06-20 15:50:44] jimevans: and they do have a bridge assembly that translates calls from their coded ui test methods into the webdriver apil
[2013-06-20 15:50:47] jimevans: or api even
[2013-06-20 15:50:56] Dude-X: neat i guess.
[2013-06-20 15:51:20] jimevans: but their IE playback of coded ui tests is completely proprietary.

[2013-06-20 15:52:19] jleyba, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-06-20 15:52:36] jimevans: it's pretty much the same as using webdriver, except they don't have an IEDriverServer equivalent (visual studio handles that role)
[2013-06-20 15:53:04] jimevans: their mouse/keyboard methods are implemented using SendInput(), i think
[2013-06-20 15:53:12] jimevans: (would have to see the source code to know for sure)
[2013-06-20 15:53:33] jimevans: and if you use the requireWindowFocus capability in the IE driver that's also the behavior you get.
[2013-06-20 15:54:12] jimevans: their element-finding syntax is a little clunkier than the webdriver api, but it's also a bit more powerful, and it's designed for all kinds of apps, not just websites.

[2013-06-20 15:55:07] jimevans: for windows apps, they leverage UI Automation (the accessibility library) for locating stuff.
