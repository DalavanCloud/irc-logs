[2013-06-07 19:43:44] crowell: in the event that there's a javascript that takes forever to run or something, I want to kill my selenium guy
[2013-06-07 19:48:41] crowell: would using ruby's Timeout::timeout(5){do_selenium_stuff} work?

[2013-06-07 20:00:46] smccarthy: crowell: is this in ruby or a different language? In JUnit or TestNG I think you can give a max time for a test, and afterwards it would go to the AfterMethod which could driver.quit()
[2013-06-07 20:00:59] smccarthy: so maybe the test framework you use may have something similar
[2013-06-07 20:01:55] crowell: smccarthy: this is in ruby
[2013-06-07 20:02:31] crowell: I just found this on stackoverflow, so it might do what I want
[2013-06-07 20:02:32] crowell: driver.manage.timeouts.page_load = 10 # seconds
[2013-06-07 20:02:51] smccarthy: crowell: that is only if the page takes longer than 10 seconds to load
[2013-06-07 20:03:03] smccarthy: but if you want to stop the test after a certain amount of time, that won't work
[2013-06-07 20:03:10] crowell: ok

[2013-06-07 20:05:12] crowell: thanks.  I'm pretty sure that's what I want, as it kills whatever is in the {} if it lasts longer than N seconds
