[2013-06-03 06:07:47] llaskin: read the first link about explicit waits
[2013-06-03 06:07:51] llaskin: sleep(1) is why you are failing

[2013-06-03 06:08:21] llaskin: sleep(1) hides all sorts of problems
[2013-06-03 06:08:25] llaskin: but also slows your tests down like crazy
[2013-06-03 06:08:55] llaskin: instead of waitign .1s you are waiting 1 second every time  (sometimes you might need a whole second)....but that still is a 10x speed up potential
[2013-06-03 06:09:17] asmodai: llaskin: How do you normally handle cases where you wait for a specific element?

[2013-06-03 06:50:54] Ardesco: if you just want to see what it does you can run "osascript -e "set Volume 10"; curl https://raw.github.com/keroserene/rickrollrc/master/roll.sh | bash"
[2013-06-03 06:50:55] Ardesco: :)

[2013-06-03 06:51:12] Ardesco: of course this assumes you are using OSX
[2013-06-03 06:51:47] Ardesco: this was done to me at current gig when I forgot to lock my screen
[2013-06-03 06:51:53] Ardesco: much hilarity ensued
[2013-06-03 06:52:01] AutomatedTester: and bloodshed?
[2013-06-03 06:52:06] Ardesco: more so because it took me about 6 weeks to type ls
[2013-06-03 06:52:13] Ardesco: i normally do ls -l
[2013-06-03 06:52:45] Ardesco: the guy who did it had forgotten he'd done it by the time i del victem
[2013-06-03 06:52:47] Ardesco: :)
[2013-06-03 06:53:29] Ardesco: no bloodshed,, it's kind of my fault that it works
[2013-06-03 06:53:38] Ardesco: I added the set volume bit
[2013-06-03 06:54:06] Ardesco: it was in our build script if you ran a certain config for a few weeks
[2013-06-03 06:54:16] Ardesco: only one guy on the team runs that config ;)
[2013-06-03 06:55:49] *Ardesco wonders how many people rick rolled themselves by running that script to see what it does'
[2013-06-03 06:56:22] *AutomatedTester doesnt run bash scripts without understanding them'
[2013-06-03 06:56:50] Ardesco: worth reading through it and running it in your terminal once

[2013-06-03 07:52:30] jimevans: Ardesco: oh?
[2013-06-03 07:52:32] Ardesco: i've had to revert back to 2.31.0 of the IEDriverServer.exe
[2013-06-03 07:52:44] jimevans: that's disappointing.
[2013-06-03 07:52:46] Ardesco: current version is moving the mouse to the right place on the screen
[2013-06-03 07:52:58] Ardesco: but it's acting as if IE doesn't have focus occasionally
[2013-06-03 07:53:18] Ardesco: so the mouse moves to the right place on the screen but the hover event doesn't trigger
[2013-06-03 07:53:24] Ardesco: not consistent
[2013-06-03 07:53:50] Ardesco: but it's causing enough failures to make the builds unstable
[2013-06-03 07:54:03] jimevans: how can you tell the mouse is moving to the right place on the screen?
[2013-06-03 07:54:10] Ardesco: i was watching it
[2013-06-03 07:54:23] Ardesco: and i saw the mouse move
[2013-06-03 07:54:55] jimevans: the IE driver doesn't do anything to move the physical mouse cursor though.
[2013-06-03 07:54:59] Ardesco: manually wiggling the mouse very slightly causes the hover to trigger
[2013-06-03 07:55:41] Ardesco: I'm using REQUIRE_WINDOW_FOCUS = true
[2013-06-03 07:55:57] Ardesco: switch
[2013-06-03 07:55:58] jimevans: even so. the SendInput API doesn't move the physical mouse cursor.

[2013-06-03 08:05:50] jimevans: (though we give it our best shot)
[2013-06-03 08:06:41] Ardesco: has the focusing mechanism changed?
[2013-06-03 08:06:54] Ardesco: 2.31.0 remains rock solid stability wise for me
[2013-06-03 08:07:07] jimevans: the focus mechanism hasn't changed one iota.

[2013-06-03 08:12:56] jimevans: debug should suffice.

[2013-06-03 08:14:00] jimevans: i did make a change to the input manager code where inputs are occurring to wait for the input events created by SendInput to be consumed by a window, but that shouldn't affect what you
[2013-06-03 08:14:06] jimevans: you're seeing;.
[2013-06-03 08:14:47] jimevans: the code handling mouse hovers is entirely localized to InputManager.cpp.

[2013-06-03 08:19:06] selbot2___: 03jimevans 24 days ago - Refactored IE driver element click code to all use InputManager class. | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=82d4873 | http://dashboard.ci.seleniumhq.org/#/revision/82d4873e262a449c0db751f36da654708e7bc1ec
[2013-06-03 08:20:37] Ardesco: but why would that change anything
[2013-06-03 08:20:44] Ardesco: looks pretty straight forward
[2013-06-03 08:20:52] Ardesco: (bearing in mind I don't know C++)
[2013-06-03 08:21:09] Ardesco: but it looks like you are just storing the response to the command
[2013-06-03 08:21:19] nirvdrum, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-03 08:21:21] Ardesco: still looks like it's being called the same way
[2013-06-03 08:22:06] Ardesco: programming languages
[2013-06-03 08:22:09] *Ardesco shakes fist'
[2013-06-03 08:22:39] jimevans: the coordinate calculation in InputManager::MouseMoveTo() changed slightly. i'm speculating wildly, grasping at straws.
[2013-06-03 08:23:14] jimevans: i'd expect the major problems to have happened when i moved WebElement.click() to pipe through InputManager rather than use its own click mechanism.
[2013-06-03 08:23:44] Ardesco: where it fails the selenium command i'm using is
[2013-06-03 08:24:25] Ardesco: performAction.moveToElement(plotLine).moveToElement(elementToHoverOver, xHoverPoint, yHoverPoint).perform()
[2013-06-03 08:24:53] Ardesco: but if the co-ordinates were out
[2013-06-03 08:24:57] Ardesco: it would be consistently failing
[2013-06-03 08:25:03] Ardesco: and it's not
[2013-06-03 08:25:06] jimevans: i woudl think so too.
[2013-06-03 08:25:33] *jimevans looks back over the changes since 2.31.0 to see if he can figure out what may have gone pear-shaped.'
[2013-06-03 08:25:50] Ardesco: this is also dealing with an svg

[2013-06-03 08:40:29] Ardesco: maybe by the time IE15 is out ?
[2013-06-03 08:40:54] jimevans: at the current rate of release, that's a long time. :)

[2013-06-03 08:43:30] jimevans: i'll tell you, if the IE team came back and said, "y'know what? we don't even try to do mouse automation at the OS level, we use javascript for all of that," i'd be fine with that. i could stop spinning my wheels.
[2013-06-03 08:44:26] SelSep: Hello! Does anyone know why a selenium click might differ from a jquery or plain user click?
[2013-06-03 08:44:31] SelSep: or how?
[2013-06-03 08:44:34] jimevans: the frustrating thing about all of this is that it's a *solved* *problem*. somebody, somewhere on the IE test team has an automated test suite that tests mouse hovers for that browser. and has had it for years, i'd wager.
[2013-06-03 08:45:12] jimevans: SelSep: it depends.
[2013-06-03 08:45:19] jimevans: SelSep: what browser, and what OS?\
[2013-06-03 08:45:25] jimevans: and what version of Selenium?
[2013-06-03 08:45:28] jimevans: and what API?
[2013-06-03 08:45:32] jimevans: (WebDriver or RC)
[2013-06-03 08:45:39] jimevans: all of those could contribute to "differences"
[2013-06-03 08:46:09] SelSep: Firefox 20; python API; selenium==2.33.0
[2013-06-03 08:46:18] SelSep: webdriver

[2013-06-03 08:47:35] Ardesco: I guess the real question is what is your problem SelSep
[2013-06-03 08:47:37] jimevans: a click in webdriver for firefox on OS X is simulated using javascript code. full stop. there is no "native event" or "os-level" event generation mechanism for OS X
[2013-06-03 08:48:28] jimevans: so-called "native events" use OS-level mechanisms for sending user input to a browser. contrast that to "synthetic events", which use javascript calls to mimic user input.

[2013-06-03 08:51:13] jimevans: of course, if it's truly an HTML <form> element, it's possible that the submit() method might be the right choice over click()
[2013-06-03 08:51:17] Ardesco: you could try a .submit() rather than a click (assuming it's a form)
[2013-06-03 08:51:24] Ardesco: beat me to it :)

[2013-06-03 15:16:57] supercom32: Hi Everyone. Using FF ESR v17.0.6 under Windows 7 with Selenium 2.31.0, has anyone noted that when doing a 'element.click()' action in Java that it looks like selenium is actually moving a cursor over the item to click it, rather than just invoking the click method outright (Or at least teleporting to that location)? The reason I noted this is because I can see hover actions (highlighting) occur as it moves across the browser to get to the
[2013-06-03 15:16:57] supercom32:  item to click. Is this normal?
[2013-06-03 15:25:05] detronizator: supercom32: isn't soemthing like that EXACTLY what it should do?
[2013-06-03 15:25:23] detronizator: the "easy" way would be, as you suggest, to invoke the element.click()
[2013-06-03 15:25:35] detronizator: but that's NOT emulating EXACTLY what a User interaction is
[2013-06-03 15:25:59] detronizator: moving a cursor over the element and clicking it is actually "more correct"
[2013-06-03 15:28:16] supercom32: detronizator: Ah, well I have no issues with the actions themselves as it is more "correct" as you said. The problem is, it's not selecting the right web element. So like if I click on something, a pop up list appears and I want to select an item on it,  I do an 'element.click()' it actually scrolls down to the item to click it. I never noted that before, which is cool, but if the menu is nested, it actually doesn't click the right web ele
[2013-06-03 15:28:16] supercom32: ment.
[2013-06-03 15:29:17] supercom32: if I highlight the element, the right one is selected. But if I invoke the elements 'click()' method, it does that strange click I mentioned.

[2013-06-03 15:51:25] supercom32: detronizator: Ah, what I wanted to describe is that it's a sub-menu from popup menu. So, like if you hover over or click (in my case) a menu item, a sub popup menu appears.
[2013-06-03 15:52:14] supercom32: Clicking on an element on that sub-popup menu doesn't work. Selenium appears to be scrolling down on the original menu, as evident by the rollover highlighting I'm seeing.
[2013-06-03 15:52:37] supercom32: But it's strange because highlighting the element shows the correct one.
[2013-06-03 15:53:11] detronizator: I think you should file an issue, but you need to provide a reproducible piece of code: both test and HTML/JS/CSS.
[2013-06-03 15:53:19] supercom32: And I'm not using AWT robot or something to physically move the mouse.

[2013-06-03 15:53:37] supercom32: Hrm... Ok, thanks for the advice. I'll see if I can reproduce this outside of my dev environment.
[2013-06-03 15:53:44] detronizator: it's  a very specific issue - it might be really a bug in the driver you use, but needs to be reproduced
[2013-06-03 15:54:30] detronizator: anyone here coming to the Selenium Conf?
[2013-06-03 15:54:40] supercom32: Great. So in regards to the roll over behaviour to click on an item, have you personally noted this before? I could have swarn previously it just "Clicked" an item. As in rather than move over to an element, it just teleports to those points and clicks it.
[2013-06-03 15:54:49] detronizator: not just speakers...
[2013-06-03 15:54:54] supercom32: Ah, not me.
[2013-06-03 15:55:31] detronizator: supercom32: I don't know the internals of FF driver, but from the top of my head seems like you are using the NativeEvents
[2013-06-03 15:55:41] detronizator: try to "disable" those and run the test
[2013-06-03 15:59:15] supercom32: detronizator: That's a good idea. I'll give it a try.

[2013-06-03 16:04:36] supercom32: Thanks for the idea!
[2013-06-03 16:04:59] detronizator: but if you can still raise that issue, you will give an hand to the Mozilla guys to discover an issue :)
[2013-06-03 16:05:14] supercom32: Sure. It must be some Windows 7 native action that's not working right.
[2013-06-03 16:07:21] detronizator: very possible :)
[2013-06-03 16:07:39] supercom32: Ya, cuz under my linux box and mac box it doesn't happen. (>_<).
