[2013-06-11 07:46:58] Todd: yeah you can have multiple versions of firefox running on yoru grid nodes
[2013-06-11 07:47:15] franaimar21:  I am doing tests with Selenium grid and by default it runs with Firefox3.6

[2013-06-11 07:52:20] franaimar21: by default appears *firefox, *firefox2 and *firefox3 in the selenium grid console. All with the version 3.6.
[2013-06-11 07:53:43] franaimar21: I would like to add one more, as you said I need to add it in the grid node, but I don't know where I can add the path of the new firefox version...

[2013-06-11 07:57:09] franaimar21: really that I am searching information, but I don't find how to add a new version in http://xxxx:4444/console
[2013-06-11 07:57:19] llaskin: check out the link I just posted....
[2013-06-11 07:57:58] franaimar21: ok ok, anyway thank you very much! :)
[2013-06-11 07:58:17] franaimar21: I am becoming crazy with this "problem"
[2013-06-11 07:58:35] WaaX: I'm instantiating SeleniumServer from my java application. Is there a way stop it from logging to stdout?
[2013-06-11 07:58:55] franaimar21: I readed your link, but they don't say how to add a new FF version
[2013-06-11 08:00:20] nirvdrum: llaskin: Never share that URL with anyone again.
[2013-06-11 08:00:27] nirvdrum: Oh, nevermind.  Grid 1.
[2013-06-11 08:01:35] nirvdrum: But I don't think the demo works either.
[2013-06-11 08:01:39] Ardesco: franaimar21: move to grid 2 :)
[2013-06-11 08:01:55] llaskin: nirvdrum: google has it as the first result
[2013-06-11 08:01:59] llaskin: you should fix that....

[2013-06-11 08:04:39] franaimar21: Maybe you are right Ardesco but the system runs with Jenkins and move to grid2 maybe has a lot of extra work
[2013-06-11 08:04:51] llaskin: why?  it shouldn't be a huge migration effort
[2013-06-11 08:05:02] llaskin: do some find/replace in your jenkins config files....and bam you're done
[2013-06-11 08:05:05] Ardesco: grid2 is backwards compatible as far as i'm aware
[2013-06-11 08:05:10] nirvdrum: franaimar21: Grid 1 doesn't lock down to Firefox 3.6 though.  It just uses the browser launcher string.
[2013-06-11 08:05:20] nirvdrum: So, whatever *firefox ends up being.
[2013-06-11 08:05:36] nirvdrum: You can use the custom path stuff if you need a different version.
[2013-06-11 08:05:53] Todd: llaskin: yeah me too. I've never actually used grid 1
[2013-06-11 08:06:00] nirvdrum: Your problem is going to be that grid 1.0.8 ships with a really old version of selenium server.  You'll want to update that.
[2013-06-11 08:06:39] nirvdrum: franaimar21: But, upgrading to grid 2 shouldn't be hard.  I spent a lot of time making sure the grid 2 hub is backwards compatible with grid 1 nodes.
[2013-06-11 08:06:42] franaimar21: wow! a lot of comments! thanks boys, but really that I don't know what to do
[2013-06-11 08:06:52] franaimar21: I don't want to migrate to grid2
[2013-06-11 08:06:53] Todd: llaskin: though from my limited reading I would highly recommend an upgrade.. if you have a lot of nodes they should be managed somehow (puppet in our case) .. your configs should be in source control... with the right setup upgrading to grid 2 should be fairly painless
[2013-06-11 08:06:55] Ardesco: The way the Track B talk is going I wonder if they also wrote this
[2013-06-11 08:07:03] Ardesco: https://github.com/Ardesco/selenium-standalone-server-plugin
[2013-06-11 08:07:06] nirvdrum: franaimar21: Okay.  Well, best of luck then.

[2013-06-11 09:23:48] garndt: Unfortunately part of our resistance to using anything else is dictated by the customers we have.  We need to cater to hospital IT, which unfortunately for the most part is stuck in the stone ages.
[2013-06-11 09:23:50] Todd: The sight of those silly Microsoft Partner banners is what sends me running for the hills.
[2013-06-11 09:24:57] garndt: Fortunately we have no partner banners here, but we have some ISO and FDA banners!
[2013-06-11 09:25:02] Oscar_Rieken: nothing wrong with MS its just a problem of the mindset of a lot of people that use MS
[2013-06-11 09:25:21] garndt: The more iso banners we have the more compliant we are I think
[2013-06-11 09:26:10] garndt: I think that's enough snarky remarks about this company though (for now) :)
