[2013-06-12 04:11:10] capox: assertNotHtmlSource with value "title" on a normal html doc (with a <title> elem, ie. at least two "title" strings in it) passes. assertHtmlSource with value "title" on the same doc fails.

[2013-06-12 05:57:51] Ardesco: Santu, you'll probably find it easier to do one type of browser at a time
[2013-06-12 05:58:00] Ardesco: different browsers have different resource requirements
[2013-06-12 05:58:34] Ardesco: if you do one browser at a time you can tune it so that you test can for example run 6 chrome tests at the same time
[2013-06-12 05:58:36] Santu: We can do it by using Grid .. please correct if i am wrong
[2013-06-12 05:58:39] Ardesco: but only 4 firefox tests
[2013-06-12 05:58:48] Ardesco: you can do
[2013-06-12 05:59:04] Ardesco: but then you are only running one browser at a time
[2013-06-12 05:59:09] Santu: Yah... I want to know how
[2013-06-12 05:59:11] Ardesco: unless you grid node is connected multiple times
[2013-06-12 05:59:34] Ardesco: I can give you an example that allows you to select browser type and run multiple threads
[2013-06-12 05:59:42] Santu: Does it require to download TestTNG
[2013-06-12 05:59:45] Ardesco: it won't allow a mix of different browsers at the same time though

[2013-06-12 06:00:25] Ardesco: it uses TestNG but you can do the same with jUnit, you'll just need to write a custom jUnit test runner (which you should be used to if you use jUnit anyway)

[2013-06-12 06:38:18] jimevans: p_l: more seriously though, your question is lacking a great deal of context. it won't fail for every website everywhere.
[2013-06-12 06:38:18] p_l: jimevans: well, does it mean I need to drop in some AutoIt or whatever and somehow link it with Hudson? :D
[2013-06-12 06:38:18] Todd: llaskin: unfortunately it's not all my code though.. we've been encouraging our developers to write more acceptance tests.. it's not working as magnificently as we imagined

[2013-06-12 06:39:05] p_l: jimevans: hmm... what kind of context do you need? The driver basically a single-window, single-tab IE8, accessing a very quirks-mode-loving page
[2013-06-12 06:39:08] llaskin: and then a line count on that:-P

[2013-06-12 06:39:40] jimevans: p_l: if it's that simple, share the HTML code.
[2013-06-12 06:39:40] p_l: jimevans: it talks with selenium standalone server on XP SP3 that runs IE driver for it
[2013-06-12 06:39:54] llaskin: Oscar_Rieken: what do you mean?  total time slept?  thats an interesting question, since most of those are framework...I bet its 5-10 minutes total
[2013-06-12 06:40:04] p_l: jimevans: don't think I can share the HTML :(

[2013-06-12 17:57:15] llaskin: i learned a lot
[2013-06-12 17:57:25] llaskin: ...one of the things being that I probably should leave my current job
[2013-06-12 17:57:25] llaskin: hah
[2013-06-12 17:57:30] nicegraham: :)
[2013-06-12 18:01:18] momomomomo: I'm coming to that conclusion myself llaskin :p
[2013-06-12 18:03:01] momomomomo: for the time being, though, I'm trying to debug an issue with selenium-webdriver - I'm receiving an error in /lib/selenium/webdriver/remote/capabilities.rb:139:in `json_create' - I've uploaded a gist here: https://gist.github.com/momer/5770344
[2013-06-12 18:04:07] llaskin: sounds like you should look here:  ./spec/support/utilities.rb:48:in `sign_in'
[2013-06-12 18:06:19] momomomomo: That's what I thought - but that's working in all of the other specs (unit tests)

[2013-06-12 18:07:28] llaskin: where is the downcase call?
[2013-06-12 18:07:33] llaskin: is it in your utilities file?
[2013-06-12 18:07:39] momomomomo: I'll chalk it up to an issue with my test suite - not selenium; just wanted to see if you all come across it often. All tests were passing green on another system :O
[2013-06-12 18:07:49] llaskin: can i see what the utilities file says around that line?

[2013-06-12 18:08:23] momomomomo: llaskin: there's no downcase call - I think I might be passing in a null user; one sec :)
[2013-06-12 18:08:33] momomomomo: (the downcast would be in the user model)
[2013-06-12 18:08:37] llaskin: i'm guessing that it thinks *SOMETHING* is a nil class....
[2013-06-12 18:08:56] llaskin: that you're not expecting to be one....
[2013-06-12 18:09:51] momomomomo: Right - the mystery is that user is defined just previous to this call, but this is the beauty of minor gem updates in ruby :)
