[2013-06-21 11:26:39] lukeis: don't use IE8? ;)
[2013-06-21 11:27:25] Phasze: Hehe, I wish lukeis
[2013-06-21 11:27:36] Phasze: Is there a previous release download pool?
[2013-06-21 11:27:52] jimevans: fast, correct, and cheap. choose two. realize that you've already chosen "cheap". :)
[2013-06-21 11:28:13] jimevans: go to the google code downloads page, and change the dropdown from "current downloads" to "all downloads"

[2013-06-21 11:28:24] Phasze: jimevans: thanks
[2013-06-21 11:28:53] daleharvey: does anyone have a favourite, 'get started with selenium in 5 minutes' guide for python / javascript
[2013-06-21 11:29:21] adamgoucher: this afternoon's first world problem; may have just burned my arms sitting in the patio chair just now
[2013-06-21 11:30:18] lukeis: when working outside, one should sit in the shade ;)
[2013-06-21 11:30:25] daleharvey: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp has 'pip install selenium' which is nice and all, but there doesnt seem to be much 'I have no clue how selenium is architected, get me from scratch to first test written' guide
[2013-06-21 11:30:32] lukeis: daleharvey: not really… but I'd recommend that page and the pip one :)
[2013-06-21 11:31:11] lukeis: test writing and using the selenium tool are actually to different subjects
[2013-06-21 11:31:18] lukeis: two*
[2013-06-21 11:33:05] Phasze: jimevans: I don't suppose there are any plans to increase IE8 speeds?  I'll just have to be happy with older drivers for IE8 or something hehe.
[2013-06-21 11:33:28] lukeis: (or patches welcome) ;)
[2013-06-21 11:33:30] jimevans: Phasze: patches welcome.
[2013-06-21 11:33:47] jimevans: how would you propose increasing the speeds?
[2013-06-21 11:33:57] daleharvey: I feel like that may be an internal distinction that doesnt need to be exposed to newbs like me, I just want to go from 0 to getting WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.get("http://www.google.com"); working asap
[2013-06-21 11:34:15] Phasze: jimevans: I haven't the slightest, and I already patched the IDE, can't you just be happy!?!?! :P
[2013-06-21 11:34:41] jimevans: Phasze: nope. can't be happy. i'm genetically incapable when it comes to the IE driver.
[2013-06-21 11:35:00] Phasze: jimevans: haha, I hear ya
[2013-06-21 11:35:00] jimevans: because people keep bitching about it being slow. ;)
[2013-06-21 11:35:10] lukeis: daleharvey: it's not internal… python has test libraries / tools (one should look into which to use) and then Selenium has python library that one can use… the simple examples on they pypi page should be enough for the Selenium aspect
[2013-06-21 11:35:30] lukeis: daleharvey: you will need to choose *some* form of test runner… there are many choices
[2013-06-21 11:36:18] lukeis: Selenium project tries to stay (somewhat) agnostic to your choice of Test tool
[2013-06-21 11:36:18] daleharvey: sorry I guess I meant I shouldnt have said 'first test', I meant 'first script that controls the browser'

[2013-06-21 11:37:06] lukeis: daleharvey: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium/  has an example (so does seleniumhq.org/03_webdriver.jsp )
[2013-06-21 11:37:50] daleharvey: I mean I have written selenium test projects before, it was just years ago and every time I come back to do it I forget how to get it all set up
[2013-06-21 11:38:25] daleharvey: lukeis: nice, it may seem obvious but thats all I needed, cheers
[2013-06-21 11:38:41] daleharvey: *http://docs.seleniumhq.org/03_webdriver.jsp is a 404 though

[2013-06-21 11:40:11] lukeis: heh
[2013-06-21 11:40:35] adamgoucher: daleharvey: you could also use something like http://element34.ca/products/saunter/pysaunter :0
[2013-06-21 11:40:51] adamgoucher: and/or :)
[2013-06-21 11:41:25] daleharvey: heh, I think https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium/ should be the home page, with a language switcher
[2013-06-21 11:42:14] adamgoucher: lukeis: did you join the webinar his morning? i didnt see twitter snark
[2013-06-21 11:42:42] jimevans: i saw it. but i didn't want to be too snarky. jim's going to help me out with some proxy stuff.

[2013-06-21 12:01:32] selena_: Hi. I am having some issues with data disappearing from input fields when I switch tabs on a day entry form. Sending a Keys.TAB to change focus to a different field before switching tabs has improved the results a little bit, but sometimes the data still disappears. This never happens when using WebDriver to enter data into fields when I don't switch to another tab or when entering data manually.
[2013-06-21 12:02:52] selena_: Is there some technique should be using other than hard-coding a sleep that will solve this problem. If I hard code a sleep after entering data into a field just before switching tabs, the data doesn't disappear, but hard-cosing sleeps is a really bad practice.

[2013-06-21 12:54:25] jimevans: my most recent tweets were a general commentary on OSS project culture than being specific.
[2013-06-21 12:55:30] jimevans: i genuinely *do* think we've lost a measure of civility in online discourse. we routinely spout garbage online that we'd never say in person.
[2013-06-21 12:55:46] jimevans: and, yes, i know i'm far from the first person to note this.
[2013-06-21 12:58:02] jimevans: but that doesn't mean that i don't feel badly that we can't manage to disagree with someone without the position we disagree with being, "ZOMG! that's the stupidest, most naive, horrible thing evah!"

[2013-06-21 13:02:45] llaskin: awesome
[2013-06-21 13:03:24] jimevans: AutomatedTester: the marionette json protocol is still the same as it's always been, right?
[2013-06-21 13:03:36] AutomatedTester: jimevans: yes :(
[2013-06-21 13:04:20] jimevans: and the odds of that changing (before moving to the release channel)?
[2013-06-21 13:04:48] jimevans: no value judgement in that question; i can adjust either way, and it's not the end of the world if the protocols differ.
[2013-06-21 13:05:03] AutomatedTester: no
[2013-06-21 13:05:15] AutomatedTester: looks like next week is release
[2013-06-21 13:05:48] jimevans: so, once it hits aurora, that's it, then? the protocol's frozen?
[2013-06-21 13:06:11] AutomatedTester: no, while it is in Opt builds, we havent "officially" released it
[2013-06-21 13:06:16] AutomatedTester: it was a soft launch
[2013-06-21 13:06:19] jimevans: okay, groovy.
[2013-06-21 13:06:44] AutomatedTester: I think the official release will be 31
[2013-06-21 13:06:55] AutomatedTester: so we get an ESR
[2013-06-21 13:07:55] AutomatedTester: it might be in earlier but the ESR malarky is a PITA
[2013-06-21 13:08:51] jimevans: that's fair too. that'll give things time to shake out. it'll be enabled in 24 though, right?
[2013-06-21 13:09:00] AutomatedTester: yup

[2013-06-21 13:10:12] jimevans: cool. so i can use 24 to spec out the direct-communication marionette driver, and tweak that as protocol changes happen. then when the "official" release hits in 31, we're ready to go live.
