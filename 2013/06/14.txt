[2013-06-14 03:53:02] foolx: i have a very very silly problem. On the url http://de.piratestorm.bigpoint.com/09?aid=3703 we have a empty checkbox (AGB und Datenschutzerkl√§rung ...) i have to mark checked via selenium.
[2013-06-14 03:54:06] foolx: i work with the cssSelector input[name=signup_termsAndCondition] and my test shows me, that the item IS found, but when i use .click(), nothing changes. Also i can't get information about the checked status of either of those checkboxes
[2013-06-14 03:56:24] foolx: even the checkbox input[name=signup_newsletter] returns null when i check newsElement.getAttribute("checked")
[2013-06-14 03:56:51] foolx: i work in java with firefox, fully updated, disabled flash
[2013-06-14 03:57:02] manoj9788: what does isSelected() return ?
[2013-06-14 03:57:53] foolx: one second

[2013-06-14 04:11:55] manoj9788: It source is failry simple....
[2013-06-14 04:11:59] manoj9788: fairly*
[2013-06-14 04:12:07] manoj9788: it should be clickable...
[2013-06-14 04:12:19] foolx: the normal fields for username, pw are all usable without problems, still, .click() doesn't do anything.
[2013-06-14 04:12:24] manoj9788: can you share the stack trace.. of the error thrrown
[2013-06-14 04:12:33] foolx: i already updated firefox, updated selenium, restarted everything...
[2013-06-14 04:15:42] manoj9788: document.forms['signup_signup'].elements['signup_termsAndCondition'] - can you try click with this locator ?

[2013-06-14 04:17:40] manoj9788: the locator which you tried is also fine..
[2013-06-14 04:18:57] foolx: no problem, will try that. Just tried a different selenium-server, but reacts the very same
[2013-06-14 04:19:06] manoj9788: the web app opens now....  and I see that I am able to perform the click.
[2013-06-14 04:19:34] manoj9788: not sure why it doesn't for you...
[2013-06-14 04:20:09] manoj9788: what is the Firefox version ?
[2013-06-14 04:20:49] foolx: tested 20.0.1 and 21.0
[2013-06-14 04:21:10] manoj9788: i am having FF 18 and SeServer 2.32
[2013-06-14 04:21:12] manoj9788: it works fine.
[2013-06-14 04:21:50] foolx: seServer 2.32 and 2.33, both not working
[2013-06-14 04:22:31] manoj9788: can you try downgrading your FF version ? to 18 or 19 ?
[2013-06-14 04:22:46] manoj9788: Se 2.32 supports upto 20
[2013-06-14 04:23:06] foolx: yeah, i will try ;)
[2013-06-14 04:23:30] foolx: your locator somehow kills my test
[2013-06-14 04:23:55] manoj9788: kills..?
[2013-06-14 04:24:14] manoj9788: lol.. pls try downgrading the FF version.. if not let see what else we can try.
[2013-06-14 04:24:46] foolx: yes, i just changed the locator to document.forms... and it directly breaks when i try to access it
[2013-06-14 04:24:52] Zoidberg_: hmm
[2013-06-14 04:25:03] Zoidberg_: invalid element state exception for me in ff
[2013-06-14 04:25:07] Zoidberg_: works in chrome
[2013-06-14 04:25:37] manoj9788: Ziodberg_ you tried foolx case ?
[2013-06-14 04:25:54] manoj9788: what's your config
[2013-06-14 04:26:48] Zoidberg_: lol oops pointing to wrong ff
[2013-06-14 04:26:58] Zoidberg_: two secs while i fix that
[2013-06-14 04:27:03] foolx: downloading firefox 18.0.2
[2013-06-14 04:27:08] Zoidberg_: seserver 2.33
[2013-06-14 04:27:21] Zoidberg_: but was opening ff3.6 - bad path set
[2013-06-14 04:27:25] manoj9788: Ziodberg_ looks like still you havent recovered  ? lol had a break ?

[2013-06-14 04:28:27] Ardesco: well at least not to a *really* old version
[2013-06-14 04:28:28] foolx: but it might help to find the problem?
[2013-06-14 04:28:46] Ardesco: 23.33 supports the latest version of firefox so it you are running 2.33.0 and FF21 that's not your problem
[2013-06-14 04:29:08] Ardesco: using an old version of firefox is more likely to cause you problems because native events have changed since then
[2013-06-14 04:29:43] foolx: i won't start using 18/19 for everything, but i want to know, if it will work or won't at all with same problems
[2013-06-14 04:29:46] Ardesco: :gist your code and stack trace and you're more likely to get useful information
[2013-06-14 04:29:47] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[2013-06-14 04:30:50] Zoidberg_: ok ff21, seserver 2.33 and it works fine here
[2013-06-14 04:31:08] Ardesco: FF21 and 2.33.0 has been working fine here for ages as well
[2013-06-14 04:31:12] Zoidberg_: (remote web driver not ff driver )
[2013-06-14 04:31:17] manoj9788_brb, changing nick to manoj9788.
[2013-06-14 04:31:20] manoj9788: back..!!
[2013-06-14 04:31:21] Ardesco: hence why seeing the code and stack trace is going to be the most useful thing
[2013-06-14 04:31:31] Ardesco: we don't use remotewebdriver
[2013-06-14 04:32:09] manoj9788: Ardesco: right, i agree. my intention was to try out things as its working here. Hope i didn't mislead ppl :)
[2013-06-14 04:32:23] Zoidberg_: did foolx say if he was using remote or not? missed that
[2013-06-14 04:32:44] Ardesco: if he does a :gist of his code we will know
[2013-06-14 04:32:44] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[2013-06-14 04:32:44] manoj9788: i asked him the stacktrace.... earlier.. But No... he haven't provided yet
[2013-06-14 04:33:00] Zoidberg_, changing nick to zoid|afk.
[2013-06-14 04:33:02] Ardesco: and the stack trace will show what version of selenium he is using
[2013-06-14 04:33:11] manoj9788: yup.
[2013-06-14 04:33:25] Ardesco: as well as a detailed breakdown of the error which will be most useful
[2013-06-14 04:33:39] Ardesco: a click() not working could be many things
[2013-06-14 04:33:42] foolx: okay, i will now upload the stuff ;)
[2013-06-14 04:33:45] manoj9788: i have asked that long back...!!! but haven't got any update... guess he is busy trying thigs.....
[2013-06-14 04:33:57] manoj9788: pls...
[2013-06-14 04:35:33] foolx: okay, here the GIST: https://gist.github.com/mschmidtBP/fbe67227ccadc47dc80c
[2013-06-14 04:35:59] foolx: please tell me if you need more infos/files. I will upload them as soon as i know what you need

[2013-06-14 04:37:30] Ardesco: the actual stack trace would be useful
[2013-06-14 04:38:15] foolx: okay, the stack trace isn't the output ?
[2013-06-14 04:38:49] foolx: It's the output directly from the seserver2.33?
[2013-06-14 04:39:52] Ardesco: i don't see anything for step5 in your code
[2013-06-14 04:40:02] Ardesco: which is what your console output is saying has gone wrong
[2013-06-14 04:41:15] Ardesco: a stack trace looks like the bit under the heading stack trace here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10621449/error-element-q-not-found-seleniumrc-in-eclipse-stacktrace-and-code-provide
[2013-06-14 04:41:31] foolx: The Error happens during Step 4a6, thats when the terms_checkbox should be checked, but isn't. There isn't a check for it. therefore he later fails since he doesn't finds the elements he thinks he should find
[2013-06-14 04:41:52] manoj9788: foolx better you can write a simple test with trying to click on the check box and let us know the stack trace of it... !!  rather than ths whole stuff. because we dont understnad what is 4a6 stuffs..
[2013-06-14 04:42:16] manoj9788: right, that's how the stack trace looks like...!!!

[2013-06-14 04:43:38] Ardesco: the problem is you are catching all your exceptions so you aren't emitting any stacktraces
[2013-06-14 04:43:46] Ardesco: so it's really hard to work out what went worng
[2013-06-14 04:44:11] foolx: ah, okay, thats one problem ;( I will try to fix that, at least for that element stuff
[2013-06-14 04:44:19] Ardesco: you have try catch inside try catch
[2013-06-14 04:44:34] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-14 04:45:07] Ardesco: you are never going to know what failed as everything is caught between lines 50 and 342
[2013-06-14 04:45:15] Ardesco: remove all the try catch stuff
[2013-06-14 04:45:22] Ardesco: and let an exception be thrown when it goes wrong
[2013-06-14 04:45:28] Ardesco: then you will know which line is the problem
[2013-06-14 04:47:45] girija, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-14 04:48:16] Ardesco: I can narrow it down to something between 155 and 222
[2013-06-14 04:48:17] foolx: i entered e.getStackTrace(); but there isn't a Exception that is thrown out. The command termsElement.click(); isn't throwing an error ;(
[2013-06-14 04:48:37] jimpurbrick, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-14 04:48:38] Ardesco: well something is throwing an error because you are catching it in your try catch
[2013-06-14 04:49:05] Ardesco: the problem is that the way the code is written is masking where the error was thrown from
[2013-06-14 04:49:09] Ardesco: it may not be the click
[2013-06-14 04:50:36] foolx: okay, the error between 155 and 222 should be the missing information about birthday-elements, not needed here, the test works without those. (not every page does, but this one). Afterwards (233-) he checks the mailElements and enters a mail into the field, he doesn't stop there
[2013-06-14 04:51:51] Ardesco: so if the test works without that why is it in your test?
[2013-06-14 04:52:30] Ardesco: i'm not even sure what's causing an error to be flagged to be honest
[2013-06-14 04:52:46] foolx: The code is going to test several pages. Some pages (like this one) already have "good" birthdate entered (01.01.1970) so i don't need to change that. Other pages got the "TODAY" entered and i have to change that to be able to register.
[2013-06-14 04:53:07] Ardesco: screenshots all seem to be taken after Step 5: try to validate registration
[2013-06-14 04:53:26] Ardesco: so my guess is that's where you problem is
[2013-06-14 04:54:30] foolx: the problem is, he never throws an exception in the first place. i changed the code to output those stacktrace, but he isn't throwing anything for the checkbox. He simply "tries" to click it, nothing happens and he then proceeds to click the "register" button, as he should afterwards
[2013-06-14 04:55:18] Ardesco: what line of code?
[2013-06-14 04:55:20] foolx: then the page says "sorry, you have to accept out terms" and fails to go on. Afterwards my testsuite tries to find several elements that are only shown when registerd successfully - Fails to find those, throws error and creates screenshots
[2013-06-14 04:56:05] foolx: 270 in the gist
[2013-06-14 04:56:41] foolx: thats where i try to click the checkbox. All log.debug before and afterwards happen, no exception is thrown ;(
[2013-06-14 04:58:32] Ardesco: in that case I can't see a good reason for it not doing anything in the code
[2013-06-14 04:58:40] Ardesco: that's the HTML of the element you are trying to click
[2013-06-14 04:58:45] Ardesco: and what OS
[2013-06-14 04:59:12] foolx: OS is windows 7 for all machines, i enter the html of the page to the gist

[2013-06-14 05:05:38] foolx: some lines down, i entered the command to click the other (already checked!) checkbox for newsletter. .getAttribute("checked") returns NULL, .click() doesn't do anything
[2013-06-14 05:06:24] manoj9788: Ardesco are you sure 2.33 supports  21 ? in the change log I see 2.32 supports upto 20 and nothing on the FF 21 ?

[2013-06-14 06:49:33] Ardesco: manoj yes latest selenium supports FF21, I'm sure
[2013-06-14 06:50:09] manoj9788: Ardesco: i have checked the locator on behalf of him.. and did a small test with having a click surrounded by a try catch .. and it did work properly.
[2013-06-14 06:50:14] Ardesco: foolx: selenium 2.21 with FF21 will not work, that looks like your problem
[2013-06-14 06:50:29] stephend_: we're running 2.33 with firefox 21, just FYI (https://github.com/mozilla/moz-grid-config/commit/92052750c2f708d082b958f80d894a075d7b671f)
[2013-06-14 06:50:34] manoj9788: cool thanks. I guess it missed from the change log ?
[2013-06-14 06:51:14] manoj9788: thanks stephend

[2013-06-14 06:53:05] Ardesco: redhawk: I don't believe running selenium as a service works
[2013-06-14 06:53:14] Ardesco: because it doesn't associate with a GUI
[2013-06-14 06:53:35] manoj9788: Ardesco is playing a rapid fire round of questions...
[2013-06-14 06:53:54] llaskin: @simonstewart did you see what I said?  Any thoughts how to work around it?

[2013-06-14 12:04:31] lukeis: they were? i didn't see any from them
[2013-06-14 12:04:42] lukeis: i thought that was just sauce
[2013-06-14 12:04:46] Dude-X: they didn't have t-shirts in plain sight
[2013-06-14 12:05:05] Dude-X: but my coworkers scored a shirt after doing something silly
[2013-06-14 12:05:15] Dude-X: i had the harder task of finding code in the marionette python client

[2013-06-14 12:55:39] llaskin: we did give away tshirts
[2013-06-14 12:55:40] llaskin: i doubt any are left
[2013-06-14 12:55:43] mmerrell: the t-shirts were pretty expensive this year‚Äîlast year they were comp'd
[2013-06-14 12:55:43] llaskin: awilson will know
[2013-06-14 12:55:56] mmerrell: almost didn't get them
[2013-06-14 12:56:00] llaskin: they were still pretty cheap....
[2013-06-14 12:56:04] llaskin: 5k for 500 shirts isn't half bad
[2013-06-14 12:56:08] mmerrell: really?

[2013-06-14 12:56:31] mmerrell: I figured the flash drives would be way more, but they were just over half that
[2013-06-14 12:56:32] llaskin: custom printed tshirts from VP cost 15$ normally

[2013-06-14 12:56:35] lukeis: i paid ~ $20 for the shirts i made
[2013-06-14 12:56:38] llaskin: we got em for ~7$ a piece + shipping
