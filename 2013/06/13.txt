[2013-06-13 07:48:11] mmerrell: I get 10 elements back when I use that locator… I've spent the past year forgetting everything I know about xPath, so I can't say it didn't work
[2013-06-13 07:49:30] llaskin: xpath sucks:-P
[2013-06-13 07:49:43] zloy: mmerrell, I've revied xpath in xpath viewer plug-in
[2013-06-13 07:50:01] zloy: llaskin, what do I have to use instead?
[2013-06-13 07:51:58] zloy: mmerrell, just a second, I am trying
[2013-06-13 07:52:28] mmerrell: CSS selectors are much easier to read
[2013-06-13 07:52:31] mmerrell: much much easier to read
[2013-06-13 07:52:44] p0deje, quitting. (Quit: p0deje)
[2013-06-13 07:53:22] mmerrell: I could make a number of other sweeping statements, but I'm not sure how accurate they would be… the only time I'd ever consider using xPath is when I wanted to find the parent element of an element, but even then I'd try to recast the problem and engineer a way around it
[2013-06-13 07:53:32] zloy: mmerrell, nope cssSelector doesn't work :(
[2013-06-13 07:53:39] zloy: the list size is still 0
[2013-06-13 07:53:46] p_l: has anyone tried making interactive test developement environment for WebDriver?
[2013-06-13 07:54:17] mmerrell: I'm not sure where to go from here—that one change in my environment made it to where the list size was 10, where it was definitely 0 before
[2013-06-13 07:54:45] mmerrell:         List<WebElement> element = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector("h3.r > a"));
[2013-06-13 07:54:58] zloy: mmerrell, yes, I have the same line
[2013-06-13 07:55:05] mmerrell: >>>>>>>>> list size: 10
[2013-06-13 07:55:14] zloy: list size: 0
[2013-06-13 07:55:22] mmerrell: try removing the > from the locator
[2013-06-13 07:55:26] mmerrell: that's all I got
[2013-06-13 07:56:02] mmerrell: otherwise, try doing a mvn clean or something—be sure your class is recompiling :)
[2013-06-13 07:56:23] zloy: melter, just a second, I will show you screenshot

[2013-06-13 07:59:33] mmerrell: I believe it, I'm just not convinced the locator is wrong :)
[2013-06-13 07:59:48] mmerrell: for kicks, can you try ChromeDriver?
[2013-06-13 08:00:20] zloy: ok, just a second
[2013-06-13 08:00:35] mmerrell: wait
[2013-06-13 08:00:44] mmerrell: I think this might be a race condition issue

[2013-06-13 08:01:02] mmerrell: tell you what—put a debug breakpoint on the line with the locator

[2013-06-13 08:01:25] mmerrell: debug into the class, and when it stops there, look at the browser and make sure it's rendered
[2013-06-13 08:01:29] llaskin, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-13 08:01:31] mmerrell: then step over the line
[2013-06-13 08:01:44] mmerrell: I think you're doing the check before google is rendering the result
[2013-06-13 08:01:44] llaskin: CSS is much easier
[2013-06-13 08:03:05] mmerrell: CSS is like saying 2+2, while XPath is like multiplying the quadratic formula by a non-linear modular form that proves Fermat's theorem
[2013-06-13 08:03:07] zloy: how can I set breackpoints?
[2013-06-13 08:03:18] mmerrell: you're in eclipse, right?
[2013-06-13 08:03:24] zloy: yes I am
[2013-06-13 08:03:29] mmerrell: hover over the line, then right-click and say Toggle Breakpoint
[2013-06-13 08:03:54] mmerrell: then, instead of saying "Run As->Java Application", say "Debug As->Java Application"
[2013-06-13 08:04:39] zloy: ok
[2013-06-13 08:04:43] mmerrell: it will magically stop at line 19, and you can step over the line with F6
[2013-06-13 08:05:01] zloy: I have to set brack on the line with locator, am I right?
[2013-06-13 08:05:07] mmerrell: yep

[2013-06-13 08:06:46] zloy: ok, what do you want to see?
[2013-06-13 08:06:57] mmerrell: if only there had been some recent meeting… a gathering perhaps, where people of all stripes came to talk about things like "waiting for page elements to render"...
[2013-06-13 08:07:20] mmerrell: well, I'm betting that now, when you step over the next couple lines, your list size will not be 0
[2013-06-13 08:07:25] mmerrell: just by having stopped this process in the middle
[2013-06-13 08:08:35] zloy: I don't know how to step in eclips :-(
[2013-06-13 08:08:54] zloy: sorry, but I havn't seen eclipse before :-(
[2013-06-13 08:09:01] mmerrell: the internets are full of tutorials on this—it's a technique that will change your life
[2013-06-13 08:09:49] llaskin: zloy: yea find some tutorials on "how to debug code"
[2013-06-13 08:10:14] mmerrell: I can say with reasonably certainty that the locator is not the problem. The problem is that WebDriver is looking for that element before it exists
[2013-06-13 08:10:15] Ardesco: ploy, i would try http://paste2.org/tXdYWgsp
[2013-06-13 08:10:15] llaskin: anyone here use Jasmine?

[2013-06-13 08:11:29] mmerrell: stick to the cssSelector :
[2013-06-13 08:11:30] mmerrell: )
[2013-06-13 08:11:49] Ardesco: but I added an explicit wait to wait for the results to appear
[2013-06-13 08:11:55] mmerrell: yeah, understood
[2013-06-13 08:11:58] Ardesco: which is probably the cause of your problems

[2013-06-13 08:14:10] Ardesco: softmanpetro:  have a read of this:  http://ardesco.lazerycode.com/index.php/2012/07/how-to-download-files-with-selenium-and-why-you-shouldnt/
[2013-06-13 08:14:24] mmerrell: @Ardesco, do you need to add an ExpectedConditions qualifier to the visibilityOfElementLocated call? I didn't see a static import
[2013-06-13 08:14:38] Ardesco: the code parts probably won't help that much because it is in java but the principle holds
[2013-06-13 08:14:52] Ardesco: doh forgot that mmerrell
[2013-06-13 08:15:03] Ardesco: wrote it from memory (which is not always the best way)
[2013-06-13 08:15:18] Ardesco: doesn't seem to be an easy way to edit it either

[2013-06-13 08:15:40] mmerrell: forgot how to use it
[2013-06-13 08:15:49] Ardesco: oh and softmanpetro as stated before WebDriver doesn't know anything about the network traffic

[2013-06-13 08:17:00] Ardesco: they are already up i belive
[2013-06-13 08:17:16] zloy: so, understood
[2013-06-13 08:17:20] zloy: thank you for your help
[2013-06-13 08:17:24] mmerrell: yeah… @zloy the problem is that WebDriver is too fast for its own good :)
[2013-06-13 08:17:24] mmerrell: sure
[2013-06-13 08:17:32] Ardesco: http://new.livestream.com/seleniumconfA/TrackA
[2013-06-13 08:17:39] softmanpetro: Ardesco thx ! I did previously a test for free download links which get_headers and compare the result with a size specified in xml !
[2013-06-13 08:17:41] mmerrell: sorry, the problem is that the browsers are too slow for your own good
[2013-06-13 08:17:54] mmerrell: got to go catch a plane
[2013-06-13 08:17:56] Ardesco: http://new.livestream.com/seleniumconfB/TrackB
[2013-06-13 08:18:41] Ardesco: softmanpetro: I would suggest that checking the file size is not really a check that you have the right file
[2013-06-13 08:18:43] softmanpetro: now my trouble comes from that if i do webdriver->get(url for download link) it seems it comes in a new session or i have no ideea how to check
[2013-06-13 08:18:49] Ardesco: if you are going to check it check a hash
[2013-06-13 08:19:03] softmanpetro: I can do $link->click()... but headers ?
[2013-06-13 08:19:23] Ardesco: I'm not sure how i can be cleaer
[2013-06-13 08:19:31] Ardesco: WebDriver does not know anything about network traffic
[2013-06-13 08:19:40] Ardesco: it can't give you any headers
[2013-06-13 08:19:51] softmanpetro: so is not usefull to click on the link
[2013-06-13 08:20:00] Ardesco: no use at all
[2013-06-13 08:20:29] Ardesco: if you use your browser to click on a link, do you know what the network headers are ?
[2013-06-13 08:20:40] softmanpetro: nope
[2013-06-13 08:20:50] Ardesco: exactly the same for WebDriver
[2013-06-13 08:21:04] softmanpetro: I've seen curl -I will give you headers
[2013-06-13 08:21:20] Ardesco: it can interact with the web page, but doesn't know anything about how the browser gets the web pages
[2013-06-13 08:21:24] riv: mmerrell: there was a way in selenium 1 to control speed. In webdriver there is no way to control the speed i think :)
[2013-06-13 08:21:25] mmerrell, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-06-13 08:21:45] Ardesco: rid no way to control speed, why would you want to slow your tests down ?
[2013-06-13 08:21:50] Ardesco: riv even
[2013-06-13 08:21:50] softmanpetro: but the i,plementation of the webdriver for php said in in the webdriverbase in curlinit curl_setopt( $this->_curl, CURLOPT_HEADER, false );
[2013-06-13 08:21:54] *Ardesco can't type still'
[2013-06-13 08:22:19] Ardesco: i guess the next question is which php bindings are you using softmanpetro
[2013-06-13 08:22:19] p_l: softmanpetro: that's for talking with Selenium, not the page you're testing
[2013-06-13 08:22:24] Ardesco: as there are no official ones
[2013-06-13 08:23:17] riv: Ardesco: dont want to do it in webdriver :) ... we used to control the speed in selenium with setspeed ... was just saying that to marcus
[2013-06-13 08:23:27] Ardesco: ok
[2013-06-13 08:23:50] Ardesco: softmanpetro, i would suggest using these ones, IMHO they are the best supported https://github.com/Element-34/saunter.php/

[2013-06-13 09:21:09] lord1234: and...no
[2013-06-13 09:21:28] dulac: it's screwing up my test run. The timeout.page_load is throwing an exception, but the next url doesn't actually load

[2013-06-13 09:23:05] lord1234: thats wierd
[2013-06-13 09:23:22] dimacus: dulac:  i bet it's some external url

[2013-06-13 09:23:42] dulac: lord1234: when I watch the test run, I notice that webdriver has issued the next get url command but firefox is still trying to load the previous url after timeout
[2013-06-13 09:23:45] dimacus: is the page visible, but the page_load still waiting?
[2013-06-13 09:23:56] dimacus: ohhh nm

[2013-06-13 09:24:37] dulac: dimacus: so the page load exception is working as expected. What I do is when driver.get returns or the page_load exception occurs, I fetch the next url in the queue
[2013-06-13 09:24:57] dulac: dimacus: also, this is on Linux
[2013-06-13 09:26:13] dimacus: dulac:  yeah i'm not familir… maybe killing the browser might be the thing to do
[2013-06-13 09:26:49] dulac: dimacus: wouldn't that kill my webdriver instance too?
[2013-06-13 09:27:12] dimacus: not really
[2013-06-13 09:27:16] dimacus: if you do driver.quit
[2013-06-13 09:27:26] dimacus: and then ask for new driver instance it will restart browser for you
[2013-06-13 09:27:37] dimacus: granted you will have a new session
[2013-06-13 09:27:41] dimacus: but if 1 test timed out and failed
[2013-06-13 09:27:51] dimacus: and you want next test to be happy… that's the best way to go

[2013-06-13 19:49:24] SamuraiJack: hello
[2013-06-13 19:49:45] SamuraiJack: I have a code on my test page, that uses "element.focus()" calls
[2013-06-13 19:50:15] SamuraiJack: to clarify - thats DOM method, called by the script on the test page, has nothing to do with selenium focus methods
[2013-06-13 19:51:11] SamuraiJack: so this method works fine when page is opened in "normal" browsers - element receives focus and I can see the cursor blinking inside of the <input>
[2013-06-13 19:51:45] SamuraiJack: but when I open my page with selenium, using Firefox webdriver - .focus() simple stops working, nothing happens
[2013-06-13 19:52:01] SamuraiJack: any hints?
[2013-06-13 19:52:34] SamuraiJack: thats firefox webdriver only problem - chrome and IE drivers works fine

[2013-06-13 19:59:12] SamuraiJack: moreover - if I just will do a single click inside of the firefox window (anywhere) it seems to start working..
[2013-06-13 19:59:29] SamuraiJack: so looks like firefox window is not focused when its opened
[2013-06-13 20:01:49] SamuraiJack: :docs

[2013-06-13 20:05:45] SamuraiJack: this should probably be called automatically, somewhere in firefox driver internals
[2013-06-13 20:05:55] SamuraiJack: other drivers works fine in this regard
[2013-06-13 20:06:12] SamuraiJack: why selenium does not have an official test suite, shared by __all__ drivers
