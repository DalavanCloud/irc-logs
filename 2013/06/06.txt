[2013-06-06 01:37:14] MestreLion: is there a way to let Selenium choose whe webdriver based on what's available on client? Something equivalent to (in python): try driver = webdriver.Firefox(); except: try: driver = webdriver.Chrome(); except: try .... etc etc ?
[2013-06-06 01:38:20] MestreLion: AFAIK, since all browsers have a common basic API, I don't care which webdriver is selected.. all I want is *a* browser, any

[2013-06-06 04:29:25] AutomatedTester: we want people to be deterministic in what they are doing
[2013-06-06 04:29:58] MestreLion: AutomatedTester: that makes sense in automated testing
[2013-06-06 04:30:40] MestreLion: but not for my case... I'm using selenium to simply automate a trivial task
[2013-06-06 04:31:05] p0deje, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-06 04:31:08] AutomatedTester: we try do fuzzy matching of browsers
[2013-06-06 04:31:11] MestreLion: (logging into Dyndns website to avoid the 30-day idle delettion
[2013-06-06 04:31:29] AutomatedTester: so you need to do remote but still ask for a specific browser
[2013-06-06 04:31:58] MestreLion: so It's irrelevant which webdriver it uses... it may be Firefox, or Chrome, or Ie... as long as they all have the same basic API (and i seems they do)
[2013-06-06 04:32:11] AutomatedTester: MestreLion: they do have the same API
[2013-06-06 04:32:32] AutomatedTester: but since its browser automation we expect people to pick a browser they wish to work with
[2013-06-06 04:32:45] MestreLion: fuzzy matching? how? I'm using Linux, and webdriver.Chrome()  didn't find "chromium"... looks like it is locked with *Chrome*, but not Chromium
[2013-06-06 04:33:06] AutomatedTester: 12:31 AutomatedTester: so you need to do remote but still ask for a specific browser
[2013-06-06 04:33:58] AutomatedTester: it will pick the relevant browser but if you pass in IE on linux is does a little fuzzy matching
[2013-06-06 04:34:21] MestreLion: btw, it seemed ironic that Chrome() webdriver was made with support from Chromium TEam, but there's no webdriver for Chromium itself
[2013-06-06 04:35:10] MestreLion: shouldn't the Chrome() webdriver also look for Chromium browser, at least on Linux?
[2013-06-06 04:36:11] AutomatedTester: we defer to their shim to find the browser
[2013-06-06 04:36:20] AutomatedTester: is your Chromium install in the correct place?
[2013-06-06 04:36:29] AutomatedTester: s/correct/standard
[2013-06-06 04:36:36] MestreLion: it was installed through Ubuntu repository, so I guess yes
[2013-06-06 04:36:48] AutomatedTester: then the chromium team should handle that
[2013-06-06 04:38:56] plightbo_work, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-06 04:41:24] MestreLion: AutomatedTester: from the debug log, selenium complained there was no /usr/bin/google-chrome
[2013-06-06 04:41:41] MestreLion: so I guess it's not even trying chromium
[2013-06-06 04:42:04] AutomatedTester: i guess Google dont want people using Chromium

[2013-06-06 04:42:26] MestreLion: chromium team provided selenium a webdriver fro Chrome but not Chromium?
[2013-06-06 04:42:56] MestreLion: or did selenium requested a driver specifically for Chrome?
[2013-06-06 04:42:56] AutomatedTester: its just not looking for Chromium

[2013-06-06 04:46:56] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: I'll tell Ken when I see him next week
[2013-06-06 04:47:32] MestreLion: AutomatedTester: well, I can't symlink... my original question is about running the script in different environments... and make selenium pick the first browser "that works" in that platform
[2013-06-06 04:47:44] Ardesco: I suspect it needs something set I'm not doing,
[2013-06-06 04:47:52] Ardesco: I'm just doing "options.setBinary("/Applications/Opera\\ Next.app/Contents/MacOS/Opera");" atm
[2013-06-06 04:48:07] AutomatedTester: MestreLion: and as I said, we expect people to be deterministic
[2013-06-06 04:48:19] AutomatedTester: we expect them to pick 1 thing for automation and that is the browser
[2013-06-06 04:48:54] AutomatedTester: you can use RemoteWebDriver and hope it goes into its fuzzy matching of browsers
[2013-06-06 04:49:15] AutomatedTester: but you are still expected to pass browser details
[2013-06-06 04:49:25] MestreLion: AutomatedTester: that's what rp21 suggested, correct?
[2013-06-06 04:50:01] AutomatedTester: no, you will have to pass in desired capabilities
[2013-06-06 04:50:40] MestreLion: can I pass an empy (or simple) set of capabilities?
[2013-06-06 04:50:45] AutomatedTester: if you dont the client bindings will either error or pick one for you
[2013-06-06 04:51:30] MestreLion: I'm using the Python bindings btw
[2013-06-06 04:51:40] MestreLion: and "pick one for you" is *exactly* what I want :)
[2013-06-06 04:52:12] AutomatedTester: MestreLion: well python errors
[2013-06-06 04:52:12] AutomatedTester: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/py/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py#58
[2013-06-06 04:52:21] AutomatedTester: MestreLion: your use case is very unique
[2013-06-06 04:52:34] AutomatedTester: and we dont support it
[2013-06-06 04:52:46] AutomatedTester: MestreLion: if we pick one it will probably be firefox
[2013-06-06 04:52:51] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-06 04:52:53] AutomatedTester: if firefox isnt installed it will error
[2013-06-06 04:53:34] MestreLion: oh, it doesn't *test* for installed browsers before it picks one?
[2013-06-06 04:53:39] AutomatedTester: yes
[2013-06-06 04:55:04] MestreLion: so can't I pass an empty dict as desired_capabilities ?
[2013-06-06 04:55:14] AutomatedTester: no
[2013-06-06 04:55:39] AutomatedTester: as I say, if a client binding allows it, they will probably expect firefox
[2013-06-06 04:55:58] AutomatedTester: so you might as well work with the 1 thing we really need from you
[2013-06-06 04:56:03] AutomatedTester: for you to pick a browser
[2013-06-06 04:56:53] MestreLion: I'm picking Firefox() currently, I just wanted to make the script a little more platform-agnostic
[2013-06-06 04:57:17] MestreLion: is such use case really so unique?
[2013-06-06 04:57:30] AutomatedTester: yea
[2013-06-06 04:57:43] AutomatedTester: this is the first time I have ever heard some ask that
[2013-06-06 04:58:05] AutomatedTester: and I have been working on the project 3+ years
[2013-06-06 04:58:17] AutomatedTester: and a user of the project for twice that
[2013-06-06 04:59:37] AutomatedTester: firefox works on all platforms
[2013-06-06 04:59:58] MestreLion: there will be more requests once people find out how amazing selenium is, and how easy it is to manipulate a browser with it
[2013-06-06 05:00:25] MestreLion: people will soon want to handle a "generic"  browser.
[2013-06-06 05:00:58] AutomatedTester: MestreLion: the python bindings and the ruby bindings have been installed over a million times each
[2013-06-06 05:01:10] MestreLion: I'm aware this does not fit an automated test framework (which is the major use case for selenium, granted)
[2013-06-06 05:01:40] MestreLion: AutomatedTester: yes, and the Firefox() webdriver works great here.
[2013-06-06 05:01:46] AutomatedTester: MestreLion: the problem with *generic* is we need to start interrogating the OS
[2013-06-06 05:01:55] AutomatedTester: which will slow it down considerably
[2013-06-06 05:02:05] MestreLion: I was just afraid of *IF*  the user does not have firefox installed.. and provide a fallback
[2013-06-06 05:02:31] AutomatedTester: MestreLion: set it as a requirement and walk away
[2013-06-06 05:02:51] AutomatedTester: MestreLion: solve the 80% and then let people ask for me
[2013-06-06 05:02:56] AutomatedTester: s/me/more
[2013-06-06 05:03:44] MestreLion: ok, its a fair approach
[2013-06-06 05:08:44] MestreLion: but still, would be nice to provide this "slower" generic browser (respecting the 'desired_capabilities' dict). You already interrogate the OS regardless of what user choose (to look for executable path, etc). The generic would simply try each webdriver in turn with a few Try/Catch blocks.And it would be slow only when initializing, a one-time operation
[2013-06-06 05:11:03] MestreLion: anyway, such function would be a convenience, not a necessity. But what about the chrome/chromium issue AutomatedTester? Enough to warrant a "wishlist" bug?
[2013-06-06 05:11:27] rstrazhnyk, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-06-06 05:12:03] MestreLion: so webdriver.Chrome() also looks for /usr/bin/chromium-browser if /usr/bin/google-chrome is not found?

[2013-06-06 05:48:38] manoj9788: raju what videos ?
[2013-06-06 05:50:02] MestreLion: as you said, the python bindings for Chrome() webdriver is just a stub for the "real" driver, which (as it seems) must be downloaded separately and installed as "chromedriver" anywhere in $PATH
[2013-06-06 05:50:07] MestreLion: (so far, is this correct?)
[2013-06-06 05:50:46] mreedell-work, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-06-06 05:52:53] MestreLion: sources for this driver can be downloaded from Chromium.org website, so it seems selenium itself knows nothing about /usr/bin/chromium-browser or google-chrome
[2013-06-06 05:53:17] raju: yes

[2013-06-06 07:58:12] dimacus1: when i'm done with it… you will
[2013-06-06 07:58:18] dimacus1: and you will say thank you for it
[2013-06-06 07:58:24] dimacus1: and your first born
[2013-06-06 07:58:26] Ardesco: nah
[2013-06-06 07:58:31] Ardesco: just build locally
[2013-06-06 07:58:53] Ardesco: much easier to have jenkins check out code and run it on a slave
[2013-06-06 07:59:00] Ardesco: than build and administer a grid setup
[2013-06-06 07:59:12] Ardesco: if i really need to fire something at a grid there's always Sauce :)
[2013-06-06 07:59:13] dimacus1: yeah well i'm in a situation
[2013-06-06 07:59:26] dimacus1: where Windows does not install all the Gems that i would need to run a full build
[2013-06-06 07:59:48] Ardesco: bleh
[2013-06-06 07:59:52] dimacus1: so, it's easier to setup a grid VMs that only serve a browser and jenkins runs tests from linux
[2013-06-06 07:59:55] Ardesco: In that case I would fire it at Sauce
[2013-06-06 08:00:04] dimacus1: too slow :(

[2013-06-06 08:00:20] dimacus1: you familiar with jasmine?
[2013-06-06 08:00:29] Ardesco: and also the cost starts getting quite high if you run lots of builds
[2013-06-06 08:00:44] Ardesco: Only the stuff i put in my tea cup
[2013-06-06 08:00:47] dimacus1: yeah i run 300 builds on a slow day

[2013-06-06 08:01:22] dimacus1: i tried it with sauce… it takes 8 mins for the page to load the ammount of tests and all the JS files
[2013-06-06 08:01:35] Ardesco: having a quick look now
[2013-06-06 08:01:37] Ardesco: looks sane
[2013-06-06 08:01:52] Ardesco: ack
[2013-06-06 08:02:02] dimacus1: jasmine is great if you need to test JS without the full stack
[2013-06-06 08:02:09] Ardesco: it would be nice ifSauce offered higher powered VN's
[2013-06-06 08:02:12] dimacus1: we have 2K of tests that run in 2 mins

[2013-06-06 08:02:23] dimacus1: yeah that would be nice
[2013-06-06 08:02:34] Ardesco: we had a look at running all our IE tests through it as our IE run takes almost 2 hours
[2013-06-06 08:02:45] Ardesco: (we run IE with a single thread)
[2013-06-06 08:03:09] Ardesco: firing all tests into sauce in parallel (20 concurrent threads) still takes about 45 mins
[2013-06-06 08:03:18] Ardesco: we have 80 odd selenium tests
[2013-06-06 08:03:40] dimacus1: that's still too long
[2013-06-06 08:03:45] Ardesco: so really no benefit in using Sauce instead of a AWS Large instance
[2013-06-06 08:03:51] dimacus1: i got 300 that i run in 10 min :-P
[2013-06-06 08:03:54] dimacus1: but on firefox
[2013-06-06 08:04:08] Ardesco: we run everything through chrome in about 10 mins
[2013-06-06 08:04:20] dimacus1: death to IE!!!
[2013-06-06 08:04:22] Ardesco: our tests are not small though
[2013-06-06 08:04:38] Ardesco: they are user journey's through the system
[2013-06-06 08:04:47] dimacus1: here is the thing though… i bet a lot of selenium tests should be transfered to say jasmine
[2013-06-06 08:04:54] dimacus1: b/c se is overkills
[2013-06-06 08:05:03] dimacus1: you are trying to test auto-complete or something
[2013-06-06 08:05:10] Ardesco: nope
[2013-06-06 08:05:12] dimacus1: and have to load all the pages… eh
[2013-06-06 08:05:20] softmanpetro: exit

[2013-06-06 08:06:48] dimacus1: not sure what "hover's on SVG" means
[2013-06-06 08:06:56] Ardesco: i'm talking about hover event's on SVG's

[2013-06-06 08:33:49] bfife: any browsers implement xpath 2.0 yet?
[2013-06-06 08:34:09] jimevans: unless you've built a framework that allows you to mix and match locators, then a By subclass might make sense.
[2013-06-06 08:34:38] bfife: i hacked in a smartclient locator that just wraps an execute when you pass in a string
[2013-06-06 08:34:49] bfife: but hate is brewing here for using those
[2013-06-06 08:35:29] jimevans: i'm frankly rather disappointed in the smartclient guys for not updating their testing bits to support webdriver.

[2013-06-06 08:35:40] Ardesco: you're doing it wrong
[2013-06-06 08:35:55] bfife: jimevans: they do now, sort of. they provide some .java files for doing it in java only
[2013-06-06 08:36:11] jimevans: bfife: then translation should be a snap.
[2013-06-06 08:36:16] bfife: Ardesco: they generate random div id="isc_XY#" that's browser-dependent
[2013-06-06 08:36:42] Ardesco: you don't have to have an id to find an element
[2013-06-06 08:37:24] bfife: you're right. but how their framework is built, you don't have any input into the attributes

[2013-06-06 11:13:11] lukeis: i do similar sometimes, yes. but I usually store the elements in a local variable as to not have to re-look them up if there are any
[2013-06-06 11:14:22] RexButler: here, let me paste something on pastebin and I can show...
[2013-06-06 11:15:55] lukeis: Todd: this is still up though http://www.seleniumconf.org/schedule/
[2013-06-06 11:17:17] RexButler: http://pastebin.com/7jna4gWZ
[2013-06-06 11:17:39] RexButler: See above... I'm trying to avoid using a try catch to switch into an iframe
[2013-06-06 11:19:24] Todd: lukeis: yeah.. I was looking for the descriptions.. it's ok.. google has it cached

[2013-06-06 11:20:02] RexButler: Best practice would seem to suggest avoiding trying to access stuff expecting them to throw exception as one common execution path, no?

[2013-06-06 11:26:48] jimevans: RexButler: the api design is such that if you should know the state of the DOM you are executing against. in other words, if you are executing a "find" or a "switch to", the target is expected to exist. if it doesn't, that's an exceptional condition (and thus, an exception should be thrown)
[2013-06-06 11:27:16] manoj9788: lukeis: yeah he is in my Skype contact… and it shows Bday 6th June
[2013-06-06 11:27:29] ryanhess: I'm having some trouble using PhantomJS with Selenium in Python.  It works for a simple test, but on another it hangs on a button click
[2013-06-06 11:28:16] jimevans: ryanhess: i assume you're using phantomjs 1.9.1
[2013-06-06 11:28:18] jimevans: ?
[2013-06-06 11:28:31] ryanhess: I think so.  I installed latest from homebrew
[2013-06-06 11:29:00] ryanhess: actually, 1.9.0
[2013-06-06 11:29:02] jimevans: 1.9.1 is literally only a couple of days old. i don't know how long it takes it to propagate.
[2013-06-06 11:29:36] llaskin1: so is Selenium still the latest and greatest?  Is there a new hotness coming down the pipe?
[2013-06-06 11:29:43] llaskin1: phantomJS the new hotness?
[2013-06-06 11:30:01] lukeis: llaskin1: wha?
[2013-06-06 11:30:01] jimevans: llaskin1: phantomjs supports the webdriver api.
[2013-06-06 11:30:14] jimevans: has embedded support for it
[2013-06-06 11:30:19] lukeis: phatomjs is a headless browser
[2013-06-06 11:31:30] ryanhess: jimevans: 1.9.1 has not propagated to homebrew yet.  DOes it make a big difference?
[2013-06-06 11:31:42] jimevans: i dunno. i know there were some bug fixes in it.
[2013-06-06 11:31:46] lukeis: how's the rain jimevans ;)
[2013-06-06 11:31:47] ryanhess: hmm
[2013-06-06 11:31:53] jimevans: lukeis: quiet at the moment.
[2013-06-06 11:32:28] llaskin1: ok so who is getting in when to boston?
[2013-06-06 11:32:34] llaskin1: i'm around Saturday and Sunday night if anyone wants to do drinks
[2013-06-06 11:32:39] lukeis: 1700 on Sunday
[2013-06-06 11:33:18] lukeis: i'll likely be able to meet up around 1830 (after getting to my room etc.)
[2013-06-06 11:33:20] jimevans: lukeis: http://tbo.com/weather/local/interactive-radar/

[2013-06-06 11:37:30] llaskin1: ok so Sunday night for drinks?
[2013-06-06 11:37:31] llaskin1: hotel bar?
[2013-06-06 11:37:44] andreastt: I am, I am.
[2013-06-06 11:38:05] lukeis: i'm staying downtown
[2013-06-06 11:38:13] andreastt: I'm at the conf hotel.
[2013-06-06 11:38:36] andreastt: My plane doesn't land before 19:30 though.
[2013-06-06 11:38:44] ryanhess: jimevans: updating to the latest version didn't help.  Any idea why it would hang on a button click?  It's getting down to socket receive, just waiting for a response, not getting anything.  So it's probably not actually hanging on the click, but on the page that's supposed to load because of the click
[2013-06-06 11:41:06] Dude-X: my coworkers and  i will be in boston monday night
[2013-06-06 11:41:30] jimevans: ryanhess: could be the "wait for load" thinks the new page isn't loaded. could be that calling the element's click() function in javascript doesn't navigate the same way manually clicking on it in a "full" browser does.
[2013-06-06 11:41:41] ryanhess: mm
[2013-06-06 11:42:02] jimevans: no real idea unless you can provide the page. and if you can, you should code up a test case, and submit it as an issue to the ghostdriver project.
[2013-06-06 11:42:05] Todd: I will be there early Monday morning
