[2013-06-15 18:43:34] Dude-X_: you want to send a huge buffer of keys?
[2013-06-15 18:44:08] codepython777: i want to type that whole webpage source into that box indeed

[2013-06-15 18:45:20] Dude-X_: you might be able to do that without selenium
[2013-06-15 18:45:34] Dude-X_: using the urllib2 library or requests
[2013-06-15 18:45:53] codepython777: Dude-X_: urllib2 and requests are both broken libraries for https. Lets not go there.
[2013-06-15 18:45:53] Dude-X_: it would be a lot easier if you can do a post to the w3c validator page
[2013-06-15 18:46:41] Dude-X_: well it seems based on this code snippet you're having a hard time synchronizing the events that happen as you try to navigate and post the source code
[2013-06-15 18:47:20] Dude-X_: the way send keys works btw is that it sends one character at a time to the browser.
[2013-06-15 18:47:44] codepython777: can you show me how to post that data using firefox in my case?  Perhaps we can use the file upload section of firefox?
[2013-06-15 18:48:30] Dude-X_: so if you're posting kilobytes of text to send_keys it's transmitting one character at a time to firefox
[2013-06-15 18:48:58] codepython777: I see. I cant emulate a Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V like i actually do on the browser?
[2013-06-15 18:49:09] ShawnM, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-06-15 18:49:29] Dude-X_: not really. selenium doesn't access the clipboard buffer
[2013-06-15 18:49:43] Dude-X_: you can send a ctrl-c or ctrl-v to the browser though
[2013-06-15 18:50:08] Dude-X_: you can upload files so long you can type a path
[2013-06-15 18:50:20] Dude-X_: then you can use send_keys(file_path)
[2013-06-15 18:50:24] codepython777: can you show me how to do this for this page: http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload?
[2013-06-15 18:51:17] codepython777: just write the page_source to open("temp.txt", "w").write(page_source) - then we need to upload temp.txt
[2013-06-15 18:52:07] Dude-X_: okay
[2013-06-15 18:52:15] Dude-X_: give me a moment to write a quick script
[2013-06-15 18:53:27] codepython777: thanks
[2013-06-15 18:54:51] Dude-X_: :apidocs

[2013-06-15 19:06:47] Dude-X_: codepython777: that submit button on the file upload page is troublesome. it's invisible...
[2013-06-15 19:08:06] codepython777: Dude-X_: Perhaps they are trying to not let robots click it ?
[2013-06-15 19:08:21] Dude-X_: that can be easily defeated though...
[2013-06-15 19:08:53] codepython777: I'm surprised that there is not much info about it. I dont know how people validate their web applications these days? I dont see another way
[2013-06-15 19:09:12] Dude-X_: they don't
[2013-06-15 19:09:21] Dude-X_: they simply write something that conforms 99% of the way
[2013-06-15 19:09:22] codepython777: so no one cares about html being valid?
[2013-06-15 19:09:34] Dude-X_: not with chrome and firefox and IE having their own rules
[2013-06-15 19:09:35] codepython777: how do they write 99% good html?
[2013-06-15 19:09:44] Dude-X_: does it look good? then Check
[2013-06-15 19:10:02] Dude-X_: can other programmers easily modify it?

[2013-06-15 19:16:32] Dude-X_: okay i found a solution
[2013-06-15 19:16:36] Dude-X_: cause i'm diabolical

[2013-06-15 19:18:25] Dude-X_: well that didn't work :/
[2013-06-15 19:18:46] codepython777: Dude-X_: I want to write tests for multiple web pages. Is there a way to open and close the driver once and then run multiple unit tests on it?
[2013-06-15 19:19:12] Dude-X_: are you using something like pytest or nose?
[2013-06-15 19:19:18] codepython777: yes, nose
[2013-06-15 19:19:42] Dude-X_: in your test setup or "before" you create the driver
[2013-06-15 19:19:49] Dude-X_: in your after you can call driver.quit()
[2013-06-15 19:20:09] codepython777: you dont mean setup and teardown of a particular unittest, right?
[2013-06-15 19:20:26] Dude-X_: i don't know how to do a global a setup with nose though
[2013-06-15 19:21:25] Dude-X_: bbl
