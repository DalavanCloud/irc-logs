[2013-12-11 07:49:48] *Dude-X wants to see someone use selenium to automate a website about controlling a virtual yo-yo to walk the dog'
[2013-12-11 07:51:40] ato: Fun fact is that the initial Selenium plans was to have a website frontend for WebDriver to control WebDriver controlling a browser.
[2013-12-11 07:51:45] ato: Inception-style.

[2013-12-11 07:54:29] ato: It would probably be wiser to ignore it.
[2013-12-11 07:54:32] jimevans: my reply should be something like "could you execute the slightest amount of effort on your own?"
[2013-12-11 07:54:47] ato: Haha
[2013-12-11 07:58:58] fuppinshire: sending an email man
[2013-12-11 07:59:01] fuppinshire: that's like 1, maybe 2 lines of code
[2013-12-11 08:00:21] fuppinshire: I think it's silly that phantomjs doesn't support "multiple class names" if you do ByClass... but then you can just do an xpath with multiple classes and it executes
[2013-12-11 08:01:15] jimevans: the webdriver api demands By.ClassName for only a single class. it's not phantomjs.
[2013-12-11 08:01:29] jimevans: if you want multiple class names, use By.CssSelector. that's what it's for
[2013-12-11 08:02:15] fuppinshire: is there any reason not to just do everything with XPath
[2013-12-11 08:02:22] fuppinshire: other than super obvious cases
[2013-12-11 08:02:24] fuppinshire: like ById
[2013-12-11 08:02:49] jaywink, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-12-11 08:02:49] fuppinshire: it seems like there's seldom an instance where there's a navigation/text area element I want that would be simplest to find by the cssselector
[2013-12-11 08:02:49] Dude-X: fuppinshire: on older browsers, and IE, xpath can be slow
[2013-12-11 08:02:55] jimevans: in some browsers, xpath can be as much as an order of magnitude slower than css selectors
[2013-12-11 08:02:56] Dude-X: otherwise it's usually ok
[2013-12-11 08:03:12] fuppinshire: yeah I figure it's probably fairly slow
[2013-12-11 08:03:19] fuppinshire: the bottleneck for me is how long it takes sites to load though
[2013-12-11 08:03:45] fuppinshire: CssSelector faster in every case though?
[2013-12-11 08:03:47] Dude-X: benchmarks show that CSS selectors are usually faster than a comparable xpath, but if your tests run fast, you don't have to change anything really.
[2013-12-11 08:03:50] fuppinshire: I'll have to give that a look
[2013-12-11 08:03:51] fuppinshire: nice
[2013-12-11 08:03:59] fuppinshire: I don't *have to*
[2013-12-11 08:04:07] fuppinshire: but now that I know about it I will be *compelled to*
[2013-12-11 08:04:22] ato: The search mechanisms WebDriver supplies are also roughly similar to those supplied in JavaScript.  So we try not to “invent our own”.
[2013-12-11 08:04:38] Dude-X: i did it incrementally at a prior job that used nearly 100% xpath
[2013-12-11 08:04:52] jimevans: the knock on css selectors is that you can't select using the text within the element
[2013-12-11 08:04:56] fuppinshire: I use xpath a ton for scraping
[2013-12-11 08:04:56] ato: Browser vendors (such as us) benchmark CSS performance.  We don't care the faintest about xpath.

[2013-12-11 08:07:00] Dude-X: fuppinshire: in those cases, use xpath for that. Parent traversal, or odd traversal, or selecting by text is a legit case to keep xpath

[2013-12-11 08:10:25] jimevans: 7056 is suspicious. sounds like the port firefox uses.
[2013-12-11 08:10:30] jimevans: (by default)
[2013-12-11 08:11:53] fuppinshire: jimevans are you talking about webdriver or htmlagilitypack wrt selectors up there
[2013-12-11 08:12:13] dimacus: jimevans:  yes actually it's 7055, and i was looking at wrong console
[2013-12-11 08:12:19] fuppinshire: I pull stuff quite a few different ways w/ htmlagilitypack but xpath is probably the favorite just because it's the laziest
[2013-12-11 08:12:20] dimacus: so it is firefox console that was freaking out
[2013-12-11 08:12:27] jimevans: ah
[2013-12-11 08:12:28] nirvdrum: ato: That sounds horrible.

[2013-12-11 08:13:19] noahsussman, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-11 08:13:21] ato: The argument is that it would make the HTML parser significantly simpler.
[2013-12-11 08:13:37] ato: Thus more maintainable.
[2013-12-11 08:13:47] nirvdrum: That sounds specious.  The point of xhtml was that it was all well-formed.
[2013-12-11 08:13:49] ato: I haven't investigated how much truth there's to that.
[2013-12-11 08:14:41] nirvdrum: Years of allowing people to do crazy shit with tags likely is the largest contributor to parser complexity.
[2013-12-11 08:16:10] jimevans: but at least now the parse algorithm is entirely standardized. :)

[2013-12-11 08:36:25] jimevans: not that i'm aware of, but don't you have to go out of your way to get a 64-bit version of firefox for windows?
[2013-12-11 08:36:33] jimevans: or have they made that a default install now?

[2013-12-11 08:37:59] jimevans: that's what i thought.
[2013-12-11 08:38:40] ato: I think it's technically possible to build a 64-bit one on Windows, but I wouldn't rely on it being stable.
[2013-12-11 08:38:42] Dude-X: firefox is 64 bit on MacOS X

[2013-12-11 08:39:21] ato: dimacus: Don't worry.  The shipping of 32- vs. 64-bit versions are purely for practical reasons.

[2013-12-11 13:18:53] therealfakemoot: The WebDriver's execute_script() function is throwing an error after an alert() box has been raised and dismissed (by hand because I'm doing manual testing). http://bpaste.net/show/uPwPnKQzXIVtDNTqRL1W/
[2013-12-11 13:19:03] therealfakemoot: line 3 is after the alert has been raised

[2013-12-11 13:21:55] therealfakemoot: Interesting.

[2013-12-11 13:23:18] lukeis: therealfakemoot: the "a is null" means something went horribly wrong with the webdriver javascript code :)
[2013-12-11 13:23:43] lukeis: if you are manually dismissing an alert, that could cause this i think
[2013-12-11 13:24:02] therealfakemoot: That is reasonable I guess.
[2013-12-11 13:24:36] wrench: I can't figure out how to get the text from a popup alert. I have: "print self.driver.get_alert().text" which gives "print self.driver.get_alert().text

[2013-12-11 13:24:39] therealfakemoot: My REAL issue is that when using webdriver methods to dismiss an alert, when I try to take a screenshot of the page (I do this at the end of failed tests), Selenium chokes saying "Alert Present"
[2013-12-11 13:24:48] therealfakemoot: wrench: Because it's not get_alert()

[2013-12-11 13:26:31] wrench: lukeis: hrmm -- with that I saw the message pop up on the browser but got this message: NoAlertPresentException: Message: u'No alert is present'
[2013-12-11 13:26:40] wrench: …but I saw the alert happen
[2013-12-11 13:26:49] lukeis: maybe there wasn't one *at the time* :)

[2013-12-11 13:27:18] wrench: maybe its not a real alert. the actual code is: notify.success('Forgot Password Email Sent');

[2013-12-11 13:27:29] wrench: not sure if that's the same thing as an alert
[2013-12-11 13:27:33] lukeis: wrench: yeah, then it's not an alert
[2013-12-11 13:27:41] lukeis: you'll need to locate the elements and click them
[2013-12-11 13:27:41] wrench: any idea what it is?

[2013-12-11 13:53:25] davidlai: with alerts, sometimes I'll just inject a javascript:   alert = function(*params) { console.log(params);};  to just log it to some global variables.  Then I can examine the sequence of events happening later.
