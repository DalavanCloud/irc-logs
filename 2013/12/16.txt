[2013-12-16 06:07:38] ato: xsanders: What do you mean by that?
[2013-12-16 06:08:11] xsanders: i have a page loading "forever" and thus my python skript is "stuck"
[2013-12-16 06:08:30] xsanders: can i timeout this so it may throw an expection or somewhat ?
[2013-12-16 06:09:07] ato: It will time out when unable to load the page, I think.
[2013-12-16 06:09:54] xsanders: but how to tell the browser via python the timeout. i found nothing working on the net except this solution
[2013-12-16 06:09:55] xsanders: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13853432/python-selenium-webdriver-how-to-add-timeout-to-geturl-function
[2013-12-16 06:09:55] ato: You could try setting the page load timeout explicitly.
[2013-12-16 06:10:13] ato: Try browser.driver.manage.timeouts.page_load = TIMEOUT
[2013-12-16 06:10:20] ato: Eh, s/browser\.//

[2013-12-16 09:11:36] dogarrhea: Saucelabs only buys us simultaneous testing on isolated enviornments correct?
[2013-12-16 09:12:00] dogarrhea: 1 database / middle tier / browser
[2013-12-16 09:12:07] lukeis: with video recordings
[2013-12-16 09:12:39] dogarrhea: In the end I would be donig the hard part of 1 database / 1 middle tier / multiple browsers at the same time right?
[2013-12-16 09:12:56] dogarrhea: seems like It don't buy much in my humble opinion
[2013-12-16 09:13:26] lukeis: you want to maintain all the different browser combinations and have it scale? :)

[2013-12-16 09:13:49] lukeis: maintenance burden can be high :)

[2013-12-16 09:14:50] lukeis: although we do use saucelabs for things we have not put the effort into scaling, like iOS and android

[2013-12-16 09:15:49] lukeis: that's because they won't recommend beta products :)
[2013-12-16 09:15:57] lukeis: appium / ios-driver / selendroid
[2013-12-16 09:16:04] dogarrhea: yea. they all seem so buggy
[2013-12-16 09:16:13] lukeis: 3 years ago they wouldn't recommend webdriver ;)
[2013-12-16 09:16:16] dogarrhea: and/or don't work on most devices
[2013-12-16 09:16:32] lukeis: selendroid hasn't been buggy for me at all and works on everything in android :)
[2013-12-16 09:16:53] lukeis: iOS, well, there's been issues with upgrading to iOS 7
[2013-12-16 09:17:12] dogarrhea: also, browsers on phones you can forget about
[2013-12-16 09:17:16] lukeis: but those i think are solved in appiumâ€¦ and close in ios-driver
[2013-12-16 09:17:20] dogarrhea: you just can't automate them
[2013-12-16 09:17:27] lukeis: you can automate the webview

[2013-12-16 13:11:13] jimevans: which is part of the reason i vastly prefer the webdriver api.
