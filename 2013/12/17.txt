[2013-12-17 08:45:53] Dude-X: and the way the api works it seems to have the potential to be really slow
[2013-12-17 08:45:54] lukeis: this is likely a small outfit… one or two guys at most, they're likely watching everything said about it (even lurking here!)

[2013-12-17 08:47:25] jimevans: possibly.
[2013-12-17 08:47:43] Dave_B_: hrm, looking at their examples i think they started by ripping off lettuce (which as i already mentioned is terrible)

[2013-12-17 08:51:17] Dude-X: also some of the automatic behavior may not make testing easy

[2013-12-17 09:03:35] dogarrhea_: what about the following situation:  There is a test that does the following.  User A creates a user with username 'dog'.  Test asserts that they see this 'dog' user in a list.
[2013-12-17 09:03:53] dogarrhea_: User B does the exact same thing on a parallel test.  Now we see a race condition.

[2013-12-17 09:04:21] dogarrhea_: Selenium says "All your tests must be able to run standalone and this will make parallelization possible" but this one example proves that statement false
[2013-12-17 09:04:22] andy_seit: Solution: User B doesn't do it
[2013-12-17 09:04:49] dogarrhea_: andy_seit, so I write a global thread to see which node is running which test and cancel the ones it shouldn't be?
[2013-12-17 09:05:02] Dave_B_: why would you run two tests that both create the same user?
[2013-12-17 09:05:14] jimevans: dogarrhea_: that statement (likely taken from the docs on seleniumhq) is an oversimplification. doc patches welcome.

[2013-12-17 09:05:43] dogarrhea_: how do you annotate tests that are race conditions on data?
[2013-12-17 09:05:49] llaskin: don't feed the trolls jim
[2013-12-17 09:05:50] andy_seit: No. My first thought would be each test requests the user data from a controller of sorts, controller has knowledge of state and provides it appropriately
[2013-12-17 09:05:50] Dave_B_: there are times it's hard to run stuff in parallel especially when database changes are involved - but use of different users etc helps
[2013-12-17 09:06:11] dogarrhea_: Dave_B_: they are different users.
[2013-12-17 09:06:13] mgalvin, quitting. (Quit: mgalvin)
[2013-12-17 09:06:19] jimevans: i approach "must be able to run standalone" to include "should not have clashes in created data"
[2013-12-17 09:06:21] Dave_B_: dogarrhea_: I wouldn't start by working out which test to run, I'd start by removing the redundant test.
[2013-12-17 09:06:42] dogarrhea_: we still want to capture that one user can't create another user because that user was already created in a test, but determining which node created the user is a whole different story
[2013-12-17 09:06:51] dogarrhea_: this is a valid use case.
[2013-12-17 09:07:05] Dave_B_: ok, so test1 creates dog. test 2 creates cat, tries to create cat again
[2013-12-17 09:07:12] andy_seit: Why would it matter which node created it?  (sorry, must be missing something there)
[2013-12-17 09:07:23] dogarrhea_: These tests are all running simultaneously
[2013-12-17 09:07:23] Dave_B_: or better to pre-set up a user (cat) so you're not doing the creation bit again
[2013-12-17 09:07:24] rebelagentm, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-17 09:07:34] dogarrhea_: we are testing the actual user creation functionality
[2013-12-17 09:08:03] Dave_B_: yes, test 1 tests that. test 2 cvan start with a user already in existance that doesn't depend on test 12 at all, then tries to create another with same name
[2013-12-17 09:08:04] dogarrhea_: is it "manual testing only"
[2013-12-17 09:08:20] jimevans: this is absolutely automatable

[2013-12-17 09:08:45] dogarrhea_: test 1 will run in parallel and fail on other nodes that don't create the user first
[2013-12-17 09:09:11] andy_seit: test1: Mr Controller give me a user to create.  Controller: Here is userdata1.  test2: Mr Controller give me a user to create.  Controller: Hmm userdata1 is in use, have userdata2.  test1: Mr Controller, I'm done with userdata1.  Controller:  Thanks, userdata1 is now available to other tests.                   [I may be over-engineering this.]
[2013-12-17 09:09:24] Dave_B_: eh? If it's one test you don't run it in parallel with itself, you run  it in parallel with other tests
[2013-12-17 09:09:28] dogarrhea_: test1 is running on every node.
[2013-12-17 09:09:33] andy_seit: ...
[2013-12-17 09:09:37] Dave_B_: that's your problem right there
[2013-12-17 09:09:39] jimevans: dogarrhea_: randomize the created user name so that the created user names don't clash. furthermore, the "can't create an already created user" test doesn't have to be done in parallel.
[2013-12-17 09:10:21] dogarrhea_: the way you configure tests... with paramemters and all it just sends the tests to nodes to run in parallel
[2013-12-17 09:10:38] dogarrhea_: where is the finer grained configuration for the non parallel aspects?

[2013-12-17 09:11:27] dogarrhea_: how do you order which tests run?
[2013-12-17 09:11:29] Dave_B_: if i have 10 tests, i run all 10 in parallel as in i run each one on a different node so they are all running at the same time but each one is only run once. Also, as jim suggested, randfom names will get you round it if you really need to do that
[2013-12-17 09:11:36] jimevans: dogarrhea_: i don't.

[2013-12-17 09:12:35] dogarrhea_: how do you capture the failed case?
[2013-12-17 09:12:42] dogarrhea_: creating a user that already exists
[2013-12-17 09:12:54] dogarrhea_: you must know the random user name created on one node at least and have another node create that same user
[2013-12-17 09:12:54] jimevans: create the user, attempt to create the user again.

[2013-12-17 09:13:04] jimevans: why do you need to do that on multiple nodes?
[2013-12-17 09:13:04] dogarrhea_: this is on the same node no?
[2013-12-17 09:13:25] DrJenkins, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-17 09:13:25] dogarrhea_: To simulate user experience as closely as possible
[2013-12-17 09:13:41] dogarrhea_: not necessarily the same user saying "Duh. i already created that user"
[2013-12-17 09:14:08] jimevans: okay, so you have two admin users, each of which attempt to create the same user. the second of which will fail, right?
[2013-12-17 09:14:19] dogarrhea_: yes
[2013-12-17 09:15:04] jimevans: how is the "do this simultaneously" case different from "admin user 1 logs in, creates user foo and logs out, then admin user 2 logs in and attempts to create user foo"?
[2013-12-17 09:15:21] jimevans: (from a conceptual standpoint)
[2013-12-17 09:15:27] Dave_B_: wait, what do you mean by node? I've been assuming you mean something like grid node, but I'm suspecting I was horribly off-base there. Are you running against different targets??!?

[2013-12-17 09:15:43] jimevans: (and that's how i'd do the conflicting case)
[2013-12-17 09:16:07] dogarrhea_: there might be a timing issue we don't catch when users are doing things at the same time
[2013-12-17 09:17:01] jimevans: then i'd get myself an api that would allow me to simulate the locking case.
[2013-12-17 09:17:44] Dave_B_: ok so to expand on my earlier reply which is pretty similar to what jim said but using explicit names not random... test1 creates user 'dog' and checks in user list. test 2 creates user 'cat' then tries to create user 'cat' again and checks it failed. Run them in either order and the result is the same. test 1 creates the account as expected, test 2 fails to create the account as expected.
[2013-12-17 09:17:44] Dave_B_: All happy, no order conflict

[2013-12-17 09:17:59] jimevans: look, the act of creating the user must set up some locking mechanism somewhere so the second admin user gets the "hey, dumbass, you can't do this right now" message. set up the locking mechanism externally to the ui.
[2013-12-17 09:18:07] DrJenkins, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-17 09:18:21] dogarrhea_: hrm. so this is out of scope of selenium

[2013-12-17 09:19:19] jimevans: the UI verification of the failure case is important, and definitely within scope. but in the interest of setting up the environment for the test, i'd find a way to do it outside the UI. (arrange-act-assert, and all that)

[2013-12-17 09:24:55] jimevans: if creating a user is done via a REST API, sure. i don't know your application, so i can't say how it needs to be done.
[2013-12-17 09:25:55] dogarrhea_: i guess the developers need to create some api for this
[2013-12-17 09:25:59] Dave_B_: i think the exact same moment problem wasn't really the main issue (as with all automation if you don't know how to test it manually it'll likely not be super-easy automatically either!)
[2013-12-17 09:26:33] dogarrhea_: i know how to test it manually :/
[2013-12-17 09:26:46] dogarrhea_: we have pair programming here. We both say "1 2 3" and then click and see what happens
[2013-12-17 09:27:01] lukeis: dogarrhea_: in the test environment you should have access to the database too and likely will be able to 'insert' records to create users (or have the developers make you an api)
[2013-12-17 09:27:02] DrJenkin_, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2013-12-17 09:27:26] dogarrhea_: and this manual process implicitly implies that both users (nodes) can see each others state

[2013-12-17 09:27:42] dogarrhea_: i look at one QA's screen and they look at mine.
[2013-12-17 09:27:48] dogarrhea_: this is the manual process.
[2013-12-17 09:28:12] Dave_B_: ok so have 21 test that cvreates two driver instances and do the same thing
[2013-12-17 09:28:16] Dave_B_: erm
[2013-12-17 09:28:22] Dave_B_: 2 tests, not 21
[2013-12-17 09:28:24] Dave_B_: no
[2013-12-17 09:28:25] Dave_B_: 12 test
[2013-12-17 09:28:28] Dave_B_: argh
[2013-12-17 09:28:28] Dave_B_: 1

[2013-12-17 09:28:42] andy_seit: Going, going..
[2013-12-17 09:29:51] jimevans: i guess what i'm having confusion about is why this has to be done simultaneously. i don't know the app architecture, but i'd suspect that if there's that big a chance that there could be a "timing" issue between two admin users attempting to create a user simultaneously, there should be an api that allows you to "partially create" a user for testing purposes.

[2013-12-17 09:31:38] jimevans: if i were building such a thing, i'd probably archtect it at the lowest level with something like "acquire lock, insert data, release lock". and for my testing purposes, i'd simply need to do the "acquire lock" bit, then go through the UI to attempt to create the user that the lock is already in place for.
[2013-12-17 09:31:41] DrJenkins, quitting. (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[2013-12-17 09:31:45] Dave_B_: if the above manual test is good enough then it can be done jsut fine programatically too within a single test. Two driver instances being the two testers
[2013-12-17 09:31:53] andy_seit: Couldn't you just have a code walkthrough with the dev of the area responsible for the lock?
[2013-12-17 09:31:57] jimevans: yes, this might require directly hacking the DB, but it'd be more reliable.
[2013-12-17 09:32:08] Dave_B_: yeah, it's be a much better test that way jim
[2013-12-17 09:32:12] DrJenkin_, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-17 09:32:29] jimevans: remember, the best sort of UI test is one that you don't do.
[2013-12-17 09:32:37] Dave_B_: true
[2013-12-17 09:33:09] jimevans: or more specifically, one that you don't *have* to do, because you have other unit and integration level tests in place.
[2013-12-17 09:33:44] andy_seit: Yup
[2013-12-17 09:34:01] jimevans: automated testing of the UI is the least reliable and least performant type of automated testing. do as little of it as possible.
[2013-12-17 09:34:15] jimevans: note that "as little as possible" may still be a hell of a lot.
[2013-12-17 09:34:39] andy_seit: I was looking for a cheatsheet for that, for test scrubbing
[2013-12-17 09:34:41] jimevans: but the point is, only use the UI to test the *specific* UI thing you need to verify.
[2013-12-17 09:35:19] jimevans: if you can avoid it, don't use the UI to set up the environment or do ancillary work not directly related to the task at hand.
[2013-12-17 09:35:38] jimevans: okay, off soapbox for now. gotta get back to work.

[2013-12-17 09:58:36] dogarrhea_: random users doesn't cover the entire use case. Multiple drivers has problems with global settings in windows. syncrhonous tests also dont' cover the case..
[2013-12-17 09:59:26] lukeis: i don't think you have "selenium tests"  (the selenium project does…) you have "UI / Integration tests" that are perfectly reasonable to do setup / teardown using other tools than selenium (like a direct database connection)

[2013-12-17 10:10:21] simonstewart: yup
[2013-12-17 10:10:25] ato: Some of the point of the WebDriver design is for people to be able to do that.

So if you want a new user defined field in all projects, you need to add it separately. I didnt have to worry about cost, so that wasn't a negative for me personally.

[2013-12-17 12:57:53] nirvdrum: Upon quick inspection, it looks like just shitty naming.  But I'd have to look more.  I think the divide is between things needed just on the hub and things needed on the hub on behalf of nodes/proxies.
[2013-12-17 12:57:54] dimacus1: but yeah… you can have a situation with 2 sets of configs
[2013-12-17 12:58:27] dimacus1: yeah i agree
[2013-12-17 12:58:41] nirvdrum: And there's also the matter of config coming from the command-line vs the grid1 YAML vs the grid2 JSON config.

[2013-12-17 12:59:52] dimacus1: so if you are using grid1 config, you can have a situation where your configs are completely ignored by proxies etc...
[2013-12-17 12:59:53] nirvdrum: By all means, play around.  But given we know the hub does work in production grid installations, I'd use that as the starting point.

[2013-12-17 13:01:25] nirvdrum: Okay.  That should be fine then.  I just didn't want to make a static member a reference to a mutable object.

[2013-12-17 13:22:39] nplatt: nirvdrum: I've not been able to reproduce consistently; I have multiple instances of the error, but I haven't figured out why it happens.
[2013-12-17 13:23:55] nplatt: It seems like either the browserTimeout setting isn't respected (since 0 ought to mean "never time out"), or a session can terminate for some other reason but report BROWSER_TIMEOUT.
[2013-12-17 13:24:14] nirvdrum: It's likely the latter.  I'd have to go through the code to be sure.
[2013-12-17 13:24:25] nirvdrum: I never allow the browser not to timeout since that's a recipe for disaster.

[2013-12-17 23:47:31] selbot2__: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
