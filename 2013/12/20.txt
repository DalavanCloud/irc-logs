[2013-12-20 04:47:40] AutomatedTester: no one is going to look at it till there is one unfortunately

[2013-12-20 04:55:11] AutomatedTester: jquery docs site?
[2013-12-20 04:57:41] Cliff123: ok, found one. I'll try to write a test case and post it to the issue

[2013-12-20 04:58:58] millenium: AutomatedTester do you have an idea why I can't find PhantomJSDriver in webdriver library? (in .Net on last version of selenium webdriver)
[2013-12-20 04:59:24] AutomatedTester: millenium: is it maybe called GhostDriver?
[2013-12-20 05:01:13] millenium: I cant find in the assembly nor Ghoust or Phantom driver

[2013-12-20 05:02:15] daemon: Cliff123, imgur [web upload] is drag and drop as well
[2013-12-20 05:02:19] AutomatedTester: its https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/#git%2Fdotnet%2Fsrc%2Fwebdriver%2FPhantomJS there

[2013-12-20 07:35:38] AutomatedTester: jimevans: millenium was in here earlier saying nuget doesnt have the phantomjs namespace
[2013-12-20 07:35:41] EdwardIII: one of the elements is on the visible page, one of them is below the viewport

[2013-12-20 07:37:15] jimevans: indeed.
[2013-12-20 07:38:41] jimevans: EdwardIII: so there are two of them. i assume you want the first one. and it has height and width both > 0, and isDisplayed for the element returns true?
[2013-12-20 07:39:20] EdwardIII: jimevans: lemme check isDisplayed (it has height and width, plus i can see it on screen so as far as chrome/firefox are concerned it's visible)
[2013-12-20 07:39:25] EdwardIII: however, i will say this, it's a real framegasm
[2013-12-20 07:40:07] jimevans: i disagree with your statement that "as far as chrome/firefox are concerned it's visible", but whatever.

[2013-12-20 07:59:38] WintermeW: hi. have anybody ever tried to run selenium serv with phantomjs ? i have a strange behaviour with it: it cannot find an element in the DOMTREE where chrome and firefox perfectly can, and since it's headless, it's a pain in the ass to troubleshoot.. :s
[2013-12-20 08:06:03] smccarthy: EdwardIII: you mention frames. Are you sure you are on the right frame before you search for the element ?

[2013-12-20 08:10:31] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-20 08:15:20] garndt: smccarthy: he should be because it's not saying no element found, but rather that the element is not visible.  It knows about the element, but can't interact with it.  At least I thought it should throw up an exception that the element can't be found if he was in the wrong frame.
[2013-12-20 08:15:43] garndt: I have similar issues with a few pages in our app when I'm trying to interact with the last element on the page, and even though it's visible to me, it's for some reason not visible to webdriver.  Haven't found a suitable page to test with though for a bug report.  For now using action chains to move to the element and send the enter key has worked instead
[2013-12-20 08:15:43] garndt: of click()
[2013-12-20 08:16:28] smccarthy: garndt: ok cool! you're more observant than me lol
[2013-12-20 08:17:47] Dave_B_: WintermeW: I've had trouble like that where dom elements that got created didn't actually get created on phantomjs (it was an autosuggest type thing) - didn't come up with a solution i'm afraid though
[2013-12-20 08:20:25] JeffHall: WintermeW: There is a known issue with lack of bind() support in PhantomJS, which we ran into when using PhantomJS with WebDriver. See: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/phantomjs/r0hPOmnCUpc/uxusqsl2LNoJ

[2013-12-20 08:39:15] EdwardIII: what should i say, switch_to_frame(0) then switch_to_frame(1)?
[2013-12-20 08:39:45] EdwardIII: the frame i want is nested

[2013-12-20 08:41:07] lukeis: the "frameset" may be nested, but that's different than the "frame" :)

[2013-12-20 08:42:57] jimevans: WintermeW: that branch is most assuredly experimental.
[2013-12-20 08:43:10] EdwardIII: lukeis: i also hate frames, i've been doing development for 10 years. i remember when frames + huge table spaghetti was the norm

[2013-12-20 08:48:40] EdwardIII: lukeis: hrm for me it seems to say 'TypeError: 'WebElement' object is not callable'

[2013-12-20 09:09:27] jimevans: that's why the .NET bindings take pains to feel "natural" to .NET developers.
[2013-12-20 09:10:05] jimevans: and why there's no driver.Get() method in the .NET bindings. set the Url property instead.
[2013-12-20 09:10:21] lukeis: python *should* be the same ;)
[2013-12-20 09:10:46] jimevans: deprecate and rewrite! :)
[2013-12-20 09:10:47] lukeis: driver.url = "http://google.com"
[2013-12-20 09:11:00] lukeis: ^ much more python
[2013-12-20 09:11:15] jimevans: but that's one advantage of a statically typed language. it's much easier to issue deprecation warnings at compile time.

[2013-12-20 09:11:29] lukeis: yep
[2013-12-20 09:11:51] lukeis: python we'll start spitting Deprecation warnings to everyone's console… they'll LOVE that :)
[2013-12-20 09:12:16] jimevans: it'll motivate them to change to the new method though, amirite?
[2013-12-20 09:12:23] lukeis: yup
[2013-12-20 09:13:02] jimevans: evans rule of deprecation: be loud, be obnoxious, and be noisy.
[2013-12-20 09:13:59] lukeis: if I get my act together I'll deprecate it and a few other things in python and the 3.0 will have it removed
[2013-12-20 09:14:29] lukeis: i don't agree with how we deprecate / remove in point releases ;)
[2013-12-20 09:14:37] jimevans: we really ought to start thinking more seriously about branching and preparing for 3.0
[2013-12-20 09:14:51] lukeis: yes.

[2013-12-20 09:15:23] jimevans: lukeis: i hate having an api frozen in stone for 2 years while we release every six weeks.
[2013-12-20 09:15:40] jimevans: when there are API improvements to be made.
[2013-12-20 09:16:14] lukeis: improvements sure, removal of a deprecated thing? that's different to me
[2013-12-20 09:17:28] lukeis: with 3.0 and FF to be controlled externally, each of the language bindings can be more independent with their versioning
[2013-12-20 09:18:05] lukeis: java although is still a bit bound with the server :)
[2013-12-20 09:18:09] jimevans: once that happens, i might consider splitting the IE driver out into a separate project.
[2013-12-20 09:18:33] jimevans: there's a case to be made that it ought to be anyway.
[2013-12-20 09:19:07] jimevans: but in my view, the biggest looming decision we have to make/problem we have to solve is where to host binary release.

[2013-12-20 09:39:28] selbot2___: jleyba: note from jimevans about 2 hours ago: ping me when you get online. i had a thought about safaridriver.
[2013-12-20 09:39:36] jleyba: jimevans: ping
[2013-12-20 09:41:23] jimevans: jleyba: so i was thinking about alert handling in the safari driver. i understand why the current architecture doesn't support it, but i had a thought this morning.
[2013-12-20 09:42:02] jimevans: is there any mileage in moving the communication pieces off of the main UI thread and into a web worker? does that buy us anything if we can let the UI thread throw the alert then?
[2013-12-20 09:42:39] jleyba: jimevans: you need to block the UI thread
[2013-12-20 09:42:47] jleyba: var response = window.confirm("Are you sure?");
[2013-12-20 09:43:19] jimevans: right. so let the javascript engine block it for you.
[2013-12-20 09:43:49] jleyba: but js runs in the UI thread.  so if you block for too long, the browser will throw up the unresponsive script dialog
[2013-12-20 09:43:57] jimevans: i admit my idea isn't even really a serious proposal. i'm just spitballing.
[2013-12-20 09:44:21] jleyba: I've considered adding an RC-like alert API for Safari
[2013-12-20 09:44:41] jleyba: where you pre-declare what you want to do when an alert is triggered
[2013-12-20 09:44:42] jimevans: okay, but "too long" is surely long enough for us to throw a modal alert present exception, right?
[2013-12-20 09:45:13] jimevans: and my understanding is that web workers actually spawn separate threads that aren't the UI thread.
[2013-12-20 09:46:48] jimevans: i also don't have any idea what kind of cross-thread communication structures you have when using web workers, so i'm probably just talking out of turn.
[2013-12-20 09:47:16] jleyba: webworkers communicate with postMessage
[2013-12-20 09:47:21] jleyba: which is async
[2013-12-20 09:47:41] tony1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-20 09:48:04] jimevans: really async? or javascript "async"?
[2013-12-20 09:48:58] jleyba: async is async...message is delivered in a future turn of the js event loop
[2013-12-20 09:49:06] jleyba: realistically, it's the next turn, but it's still async
[2013-12-20 09:49:55] jimevans: yep got it
[2013-12-20 09:51:37] jimevans: does postMessage return immediately, even if the target thread is blocked?
[2013-12-20 09:52:44] jleyba: yes

I have a question about isDisplayed for WebElements. isDisplayed returns true for an element (we'll say a button for example) even if there is another element in front of it (i.e. a div is positioned over it). I would've thought that if the button wasnt visible on the screen it would return false for isDisplayed().

I had a look at the w3c docs here: http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/ and the criteria for checking isDisplayed doesnt seem to mention anything about elements hidden by css (ithout using display none)
[2013-12-20 14:20:30] irishshagua: so, was just wondering is there any way to check for visibility including these quirks?
[2013-12-20 14:21:35] irishshagua: I did a little jsFiddle page to show what way the button is hidden... http://jsfiddle.net/zpXPM/5/show/ (in case my skills of description are lacking :-P)

[2013-12-20 14:27:32] AutomatedTester: irishshagua: if you want to check if your item is visible you can execute JS to figure out if it is the top level element

[2013-12-20 14:28:30] AutomatedTester: irishshagua: if you use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.elementFromPoint and then test if the element you searched for is equal to the element that should receive a click
[2013-12-20 14:29:01] AutomatedTester: its not fool proof but it might give you enough to test what the top level element is
