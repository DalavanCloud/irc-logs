[2013-12-06 05:59:26] zeljkof: ato: hm, then it is maybe just my machine
[2013-12-06 06:00:18] ato: Well, I guess Sauce is running an older version of Opera.
[2013-12-06 06:00:55] ato: I've seen that problem with strange characters before.  If I remember correctly it had to do with the protobuf classes being compiled with the wrong version of protoc.

[2013-12-06 06:35:05] barancev: killing iPhoneDirver too, of course
[2013-12-06 06:35:08] ato: That question came up here on the channel yesterday too.

[2013-12-06 06:37:42] simonstewart: Letting the conversation draw to a close
[2013-12-06 06:38:19] jimevans: it's virtually identical to the java implementation, except that the ExpectedConditions class we provide doesn't have nearly as many options. that's mainly because c# developers tend to be pretty comfortable with lambda expressions these days, and it's pretty damned easy to write them in c#
[2013-12-06 06:38:44] jimevans: ohai simonstewart!
[2013-12-06 06:38:58] ato: jimevans: That's fine.  The one in Python is radically different too.
[2013-12-06 06:39:06] ato: (And I just did my own interpretation of it for Marionette.)

[2013-12-06 06:42:41] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: tl;dr; MS shipped WinPhoneDriver and no longer support it

[2013-12-06 06:44:22] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: I have started a conversation with John about it
[2013-12-06 06:44:34] simonstewart: grief
[2013-12-06 06:44:48] jimevans: my involvement came because i was working on the same thing internally here at work.
[2013-12-06 06:45:10] simonstewart: John is a brilliant chap
[2013-12-06 06:45:32] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: that was my exact tweet
[2013-12-06 06:45:49] jimevans: which i echoed. :)
[2013-12-06 06:46:17] simonstewart: When I get on to twitter again today, I shall repeat the refrain
[2013-12-06 06:46:28] jimevans: anyway, when i heard about the MSFT implementation, and saw they'd published to codeplex, i looked at it, and saw i could overcome one of their initial limitations (lack of frames support), so i put together a pull request that cleaned up stuff, got them using the injected atoms, and implemented frame support.
[2013-12-06 06:46:45] simonstewart: nice
[2013-12-06 06:47:10] simonstewart: And they did or didn't take it?
[2013-12-06 06:47:37] jimevans: in working with the "owner" to get the pull request merged, that was when i got in email, "As I mentioned on the Selenium's dev group, I initially planned just to check it in into Selenium's tree and do not spend time on its administration at all."
[2013-12-06 06:47:49] jimevans: no, it got merged last night.
[2013-12-06 06:48:56] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I need to go through that email thread again and just do some OSS education
[2013-12-06 06:48:57] jimevans: further email conversation showed that the codeplex project is a "here it is. we're not supporting or maintaining it though."
[2013-12-06 06:49:17] AutomatedTester: jimevans: can you send me links to these precise conversations
[2013-12-06 06:49:33] jimevans: AutomatedTester: they're in private email, i'm afraid.
[2013-12-06 06:50:00] AutomatedTester: ok
[2013-12-06 06:50:39] jimevans: again, just me working with the owner to get that initial pull request merged. i'm also going to be added to the project as a contributor, so i won't need to go through the merge process anymore.
[2013-12-06 06:50:56] jimevans: which means i'm going to end up owning maintenance of another driver.
[2013-12-06 06:50:58] jimevans: apparently.
[2013-12-06 06:51:19] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I dont understand the "apparently I'll own it" part
[2013-12-06 06:51:20] jimevans: or be the only one really contributing to it, which amounts to the same thing
[2013-12-06 06:51:45] AutomatedTester: why do you have to own it?
[2013-12-06 06:52:01] jimevans: because nobody else gives a damn about it, and i need it for work.
[2013-12-06 06:52:07] jimevans: sorry.

[2013-12-06 07:03:23] nullx: weird thing is

[2013-12-06 07:04:43] jimevans: nullx: what language bindings do you use?

[2013-12-06 07:05:36] jimevans: the PhantomJSDriverService should allow you to set most of those phantomjs command line options.

[2013-12-06 07:07:30] nullx: indeed

[2013-12-06 07:07:41] nullx: in my test with phantomjs directly it worked
[2013-12-06 07:08:13] jimevans: well, i suppose it's possible that the parameters aren't getting passed properly on the command line to phantomjs.
[2013-12-06 07:08:29] nullx: easy way to tell
[2013-12-06 07:09:04] nullx: yay
[2013-12-06 07:09:06] nullx: it works!
[2013-12-06 07:09:06] ato: jimevans: I'm not going to go all defensive about the free software community and Linux here, but they are making it substantially easier for people to get stuff done, even cross platform, than most other technology I've used.
[2013-12-06 07:09:21] nullx: wasn't passing the service to the thing itself
[2013-12-06 07:16:13] jimevans: ato: i wouldn't argue against that, but there's a distinct feeling of, "we'll do linux and os x first, and if you use windows, you're out of luck" in a lot of projects i encounter. it helps that os x has a posix underpinning, and many of the raw API calls can be used interchangeably.
[2013-12-06 07:16:50] ato: I think you'll find for end-user consumer software it's usually the other way around.

[2013-12-06 07:39:45] narayans: and i didnt have to disablr native events. however when i used an earlier version (i think 2.35) i got an error from the driver. java bindings btw.
[2013-12-06 07:40:03] narayans: pardon my punctuation, typing from my phone
[2013-12-06 07:40:56] jimevans: ah. the native events binary component is loaded in the chrome.manifest if appversion>=25.
[2013-12-06 07:41:15] jimevans: it might not work properly, because the binary api might change.

[2013-12-06 07:50:04] AutomatedTester: jimevans: so am I
[2013-12-06 07:50:06] AutomatedTester: so am I
[2013-12-06 07:50:38] jimevans: narayans: the firefox driver is implemented as a firefox extension. extensions have a chrome.manifest file describing the binary contents of the extension.
[2013-12-06 07:51:07] *jimevans wonders how many people will get his proper use of "champing" as opposed to the incorrect "chomping"'
[2013-12-06 07:51:44] narayans: i get it now that you provide a reference :-)
[2013-12-06 07:51:55] jimevans: narayans: so that information comes from looking at the firefox driver source code.
[2013-12-06 07:52:42] AutomatedTester: jimevans: chomping is not incorrect, you can use it since chomping has long been used for chewing
[2013-12-06 07:53:38] narayans: thanks for the patience jim. i wonder what the process of fixing native events involve
[2013-12-06 07:53:43] vergiliu: hi guys, could anyone tell me if selenium latest (2.38.1) should work out of the box with python 3.3 (on Mac if that's of any importance) ? :D
[2013-12-06 07:54:09] narayans: while chomping would be to cut down, champing would be to augment, correct?

[2013-12-06 08:21:02] jimevans: got a quick selendroid atoms question. do you use the atom for driver.switchTo().defaultContent()?
[2013-12-06 08:21:09] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-06 08:22:04] ddary: i'm not sure if driver.switchTo().defaultContent() is implemented at all, to which end point is this pointing?
[2013-12-06 08:22:57] ddary: So by default the atoms are used to interact with the webview, when the user switches to: driver.switchTo().window("WEBVIEW");
[2013-12-06 08:23:04] jimevans: it points to /session/:sessionid/frame where the id in the json body is null.
[2013-12-06 08:23:57] jimevans: you mentioned using an atoms target for selendroid in the discussion on se-dev, but i've got an issue using this particular atom in the windows phone driver.
[2013-12-06 08:24:01] papegaaij, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-12-06 08:24:14] ddary: that endpoint is not implemented: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-server/src/main/java/io/selendroid/server/AndroidServlet.java#L143
[2013-12-06 08:24:17] jimevans: i have a workaround, but jleyba thinks my fix would break the legacy android driver.
[2013-12-06 08:25:04] jimevans: well okay then, i guess that answers my question.
[2013-12-06 08:25:40] ddary: what kind of issue your fix will cause?
[2013-12-06 08:25:53] jimevans: my point was that if i made this change, i didn't care much about breaking android driver (since we've long started the process of deprecation there), but i *really* care about breaking selendroid.
[2013-12-06 08:26:08] jimevans: i'm not sure. i've not tried it anywhere except windows phone.
[2013-12-06 08:26:29] jimevans: i'm strictly going off jleyba's analysis.
[2013-12-06 08:26:52] ddary: if you can generate the java atoms file and give it to me, i can have a look

[2013-12-06 11:25:21] Cheekio: I have a webapp I'm testing with selenium, and it seems like too many items have to be done in order. I atomize my functional tests (page load, form renders, input is submittable), but it feels like each new test needs to be an amalgum of each test before it
[2013-12-06 11:26:32] Cheekio: So I end up with test_first_thing: ~assert(whatever); test_second_thing: helperfunction_that_replicates_first_test(); ~assert(whatever2)
[2013-12-06 11:27:03] Cheekio: But like x8. So my end up with test 8 that's just a series of helper functions to redo what all the other tests did
[2013-12-06 11:27:23] Cheekio: with last 'did it work?' question.
[2013-12-06 11:27:24] Oscar: this is where i would chime in and ask are you testing your applications elements or its behaviors :)
[2013-12-06 11:27:53] lukeis: you should look into some way to setup the test data on your website to skip those first steps as much as possible (doing 'setup' with webdriver is not ideal)
[2013-12-06 11:28:01] Cheekio: In my mind, I'm saying I'm testing that it "works", so I guess behavior?
[2013-12-06 11:28:51] Cheekio: Should I be testing elements?
[2013-12-06 11:29:14] Cheekio: What will wow my boss and make me popular with the opposite gender?
[2013-12-06 11:29:27] Oscar: well testing behavior would be like, registering a new account on the site and your assert would be the new account or some success page
[2013-12-06 11:29:47] lukeis: Cheekio: nothing with regards to test automation in my experience ;)
[2013-12-06 11:30:03] Oscar: asserting for elements would be visit the registration page, validate the items are there
[2013-12-06 11:30:12] Cheekio: Well, hopefully wowing the boss is possible
[2013-12-06 11:30:27] Oscar: then filling out the form and asserting it was submitted
[2013-12-06 11:30:49] lukeis: depends on the boss and there level of understanding of tech… which could in turn give you a bonus or more $$ and then it'll wow the opposite gender ;)
[2013-12-06 11:30:52] Oscar: then filling out the form and submitting it and then validating the account was created

[2013-12-06 11:32:06] Oscar: well here is my question
[2013-12-06 11:32:36] Oscar: do you need to have a test for the form and its elements, if you have one that registers an account
[2013-12-06 11:33:06] Oscar: that would imo be the difference between testing for elements and testing for behavior
[2013-12-06 11:33:15] Cheekio: Ok
[2013-12-06 11:33:23] Cheekio: I don't think I do
[2013-12-06 11:33:48] Cheekio: So don't atomize my tests that build on them, consider an action that has to be completed as a sequence a single action
[2013-12-06 11:33:53] Cheekio: single "test"*
[2013-12-06 11:34:17] Oscar: i dont know, i guess thats up to you

[2013-12-06 11:35:50] Cheekio: Well, If I make larger functional tests, I imagine I can do more interesting things
[2013-12-06 11:36:00] Cheekio: and I'll have to hope the unit tests cover the small stuff
[2013-12-06 11:36:06] Oscar: well
[2013-12-06 11:36:41] Oscar: so there are flow thru the application
[2013-12-06 11:36:51] Oscar: flows
[2013-12-06 11:37:10] Oscar: if something changes in the flow your test would fail
[2013-12-06 11:37:23] Oscar: like if your flow is to successfully register an account
[2013-12-06 11:37:56] Oscar: if the form changes(new required fields or something) your test would fail because it would not be able to successfully register
[2013-12-06 11:39:28] ddary, quitting. (Quit: ddary)
[2013-12-06 11:40:41] Cheekio: I mean, if someone changes an id tag then my tests will fail
[2013-12-06 11:41:00] Cheekio: should I make long tests, and assert along the way?
[2013-12-06 11:41:28] Cheekio: that way you can debug easier than "well, user reg is broken"
[2013-12-06 11:42:22] jimevans: Cheekio: i wouldn't do it that way.
[2013-12-06 11:42:40] jimevans: i'd have a test that tests my user registration flow through the UI.
[2013-12-06 11:42:56] Oscar: i don't like soft asserts or asserting along the way, if you are using page objects the failure would be in a class (that is hopefully named after a page, and a method that would have the name of the action you have to do)
[2013-12-06 11:43:20] jimevans: any other tests that require a user for the application, I'd pre-seed the user in the back end (using direct database injection, or an application provided api).
[2013-12-06 11:44:13] jimevans: just like i wouldn't go through my application's login flow for every test. i'd get the cookie information and set it on the driver, then navigate directly to the desired page via the url.
[2013-12-06 11:44:14] Oscar: i don't like soft asserts or asserting along the way, << I'm more of commit or don't. if you care about it write the test for it, if you dont then why write a test just to have a lot of tests
[2013-12-06 11:44:39] Oscar: yeah what jim said, I would have a factory that injects my user in the db for all other tests that are not registering a new user
[2013-12-06 11:44:54] Oscar: JimEvans4President
[2013-12-06 11:45:18] jimevans: Oscar: i like your ambition, but let's get elected to congress first. :)
[2013-12-06 11:46:06] Oscar: im going to start making shirts
[2013-12-06 11:46:21] jimevans: heh
[2013-12-06 11:48:13] Oscar: i think getting elected to congress would be hard if you actually do what you say :/
[2013-12-06 11:48:34] Oscar: or make sense when you talk

[2013-12-06 11:51:06] ato: Small screen is small.
[2013-12-06 11:51:44] lukeis: heh… but ato this is just another example of lack of documentation / things you 'just have to know'
[2013-12-06 11:52:32] ato: There is docs on this somewhere, but I remember them being hard to find.
[2013-12-06 11:52:45] lukeis: the information is very scattered

[2013-12-06 20:00:54] Catu: I am a manual tester and started going through selenium today. I have a very basic question so please excuse my lack of knowledge on selenium. In manual testing, we create test cases based on requirements and then run it for testing whether it's a completely new application or old. When using selenium how is this accomplished. We use record , playback and edit while testing so if say title is wrong on the web app and not as per require
[2013-12-06 20:01:22] Catu: Get passed during playback as wrong title would be recorded during the run?
