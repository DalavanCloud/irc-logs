[2013-12-02 07:09:36] Zeukkari: Im new to selenium and I want to use a user extension with selenium rc. Im not comfortable with any of the language bindings yet, so Im testing the server side by manually creating JsonWire requests. The problem is: Im not sure how to create a JsonWire request that corresponds with a selenium user extension command. The user extension Im testing is: https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo/blob/master/component/simulator/tool/user-extensions/user-extens

[2013-12-02 07:49:01] Zeukkari: Im developing a deskop-like app using the qooxdoo framework, which generates rather complex dom-trees. There's a selenium extension which defines some custom selectors and actions which look really useful. Im trying to figure out how to use those extensions with webdriver python bindings.

[2013-12-02 08:38:31] cgoldberg: Zeukkari, fwiw, controlling the server via wire protocol is massively harder than just using the language bindings... why not just learn some python starting with simple Webdriver scripts?

[2013-12-02 08:41:27] daleharvey: yeh its helped me out, now my main issue is why I need a > 40MB of dependancies (standalone-server + chromedriver) for what as far as I can tell should mostly be proxying commands to a browser, would be nice to get rid of as much as that as possible, also looking into appium for having tests run on phonegap etc
[2013-12-02 08:42:01] cgoldberg: daleharvey, why do you need the standalone server?
[2013-12-02 08:42:55] cgoldberg: the client drivers (non-remote) don't need it

[2013-12-02 08:47:21] cgoldberg: daleharvey, which language are you using?
[2013-12-02 08:47:27] daleharvey: Every time I get into selenium I get fairly confused, so if I have a script https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb/blob/master/bin/test-browser.js, how do I make that work without installing selenium-standalone
[2013-12-02 08:48:41] Dave_B_: g'day jim
[2013-12-02 08:48:53] cgoldberg: daleharvey, ah javascript.  I'm not familiar with how webdriverjs works.  it may rely on selenium remote and require the server.. really not sure
[2013-12-02 08:49:48] cgoldberg: daleharvey, but for example, python bindings are like you described... they just hook directly into the browser... no java server needed for local instances
[2013-12-02 08:51:40] daleharvey: cgoldberg: ah, thats nice, any chance you can point me to where the python bindings do that (if theres any high level of how the comm works would be nice too)

[2013-12-02 10:20:54] dska, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-02 10:21:17] jimevans: the problem is that sometimes, unexpectedly, you can cross a protected mode boundary even if you've properly set all of the protected mode settings. when that happens, you're dead in the water.
[2013-12-02 10:21:29] dska: hey @ all
[2013-12-02 10:22:17] dska: i saw, that selenoum ide (capture/replay) canot upload files, because a windwos gui opens up,  and the ide can not save the interactions there.
[2013-12-02 10:22:28] dska: Does java + webdriver can handle this ?
[2013-12-02 10:22:38] jleyba: yes, but don't test uploads with selenium
[2013-12-02 10:22:58] dska: jleyba,  why not ?
[2013-12-02 10:23:10] jleyba: you'll have a much easier time just using a standard http client
[2013-12-02 10:23:30] jimevans: jleyba: there's a registry key you can set that will disable that problem, but i don't know what it is yet. it's going through the legal channels at microsoft to be released to the public.

[2013-12-02 10:26:10] jleyba: which can interfere with how IE interprets a pac file (see support article linked in #6629)

[2013-12-02 10:27:21] jleyba: The second issue is I have a bunch of proxy based tests I'm about to push to Selenium. These tests start a bunch of browser sessions with various proxy settings.
[2013-12-02 10:28:14] awilson820, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-02 10:28:18] jleyba: It appears in IE if you go from a pac that uses direct connections to no proxy, IE gets hosed causing all subsequent tests in the suite to fail to load pages
[2013-12-02 10:28:55] jleyba: Happens about 40% of the time.  I'm running those tests in isolation here, not sure how to handle them for the OSS project
[2013-12-02 10:29:32] jimevans: is there any difference between using single-instance proxy settings and global proxy settings?
[2013-12-02 10:29:50] jleyba: doesn't appear to be
[2013-12-02 10:30:08] jimevans: well that sounds suboptimal
[2013-12-02 10:30:51] jleyba: I haven't tried with the old WindowsProxyManager - even with this bug the IEDriver can handle more cases correctly than WPM (so good work there!)
