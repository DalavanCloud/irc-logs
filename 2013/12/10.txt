[2013-12-10 07:19:42] simonstewart: Which address?
[2013-12-10 07:19:47] simonstewart: My personal one?

[2013-12-10 07:21:15] simonstewart: Orientation unlocked?
[2013-12-10 07:21:52] ato: Like, set orientation.  Imagine some other process/person/human/robot rotating the phone.  Should those interactions be accepted or discarded?

[2013-12-10 07:22:57] simonstewart: If someone decides to rotate the phone mid test, then we're screwed
[2013-12-10 07:23:00] ato: Also, web apps can specify a web application's orientation.  Which could be problematic here.
[2013-12-10 07:23:07] simonstewart: Same as if someone resized a browser window mid test
[2013-12-10 07:23:23] simonstewart: The call to set can fail
[2013-12-10 07:23:25] simonstewart: That's fine
[2013-12-10 07:23:27] ato: Yeah.  But as vendors we have the option to lock it completely.
[2013-12-10 07:23:39] ato: Which is what my implementation for Marionette does currently.
[2013-12-10 07:23:52] ato: In fact, it would be pretty hard not to lock it.
[2013-12-10 07:23:53] simonstewart: I think that's fine
[2013-12-10 07:24:03] simonstewart: I'd just leave that bit of the spec vague
[2013-12-10 07:24:20] ato: Yeah.  My head is bubbling over with edge cases right now. \-:
[2013-12-10 07:24:28] simonstewart: KISS
[2013-12-10 07:24:47] ato: I'd be happy to cut down on that diff.  It's a little too specific IMO.
[2013-12-10 07:25:00] ato: Also I'm unsure about some of the ways to define things.
[2013-12-10 07:25:28] simonstewart: I see you've mashed in the invalid argument diff too
[2013-12-10 07:25:34] ato: Especially the role based interfaces.  And the WebIDL readonly attribute vs. method.
[2013-12-10 07:25:37] llaskin, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-10 07:26:02] ato: Yes, it's kind of needed to get this right IMO.  But we could land that separately, and have this diff just do a WebDriverException.
[2013-12-10 07:27:06] simonstewart: You'll need to run a spell check over it
[2013-12-10 07:28:05] simonstewart: The interface definition for Rotatable is complete, and so doesn't need to be labeled "partial"
[2013-12-10 07:28:31] ato: Right, I was unsure about that.
[2013-12-10 07:28:52] simonstewart: Basically, if you plan on adding methods to the interface throughout the spec, leave it "partial"
[2013-12-10 07:29:00] simonstewart: Otherwise, just declare the interface.
[2013-12-10 07:29:37] ato: OK, I was confused by how the Screen Orientation API extends the Screen interface, but we're not really doing that here.
[2013-12-10 07:29:38] simonstewart: Are you using emacs for editing this?
[2013-12-10 07:29:48] ato: ofc.
[2013-12-10 07:29:57] simonstewart: I can tell by the way the text is formatted
[2013-12-10 07:30:49] ato: I can fix up everything to one-liners before we put it in, if that helps.
[2013-12-10 07:31:04] ato: It's just a nightmare to edit in any fine text editor.
[2013-12-10 07:31:06] simonstewart: Not worried

[2013-12-10 07:31:47] simonstewart: There's an assumption that local end implementations add the interfaces matching capabilities, but we've never before used MUST there
[2013-12-10 07:32:02] simonstewart: It'd be legit to use a plain RemoteWebDriver with marionette
[2013-12-10 07:32:11] simonstewart: Which would violate this spec as written
[2013-12-10 07:32:46] simonstewart: What happens if you can read the orientation but can't set it?
[2013-12-10 07:33:10] ato: Good point, we shouldn't mandate that it MUST be added.
[2013-12-10 07:33:36] simonstewart: That final paragraph needs a little cleaning up, but otherwise it looks ok

[2013-12-10 07:34:15] gdennis, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-10 07:34:24] ato: Also a fair point.  Firefox allows the screen orientation to be read, even on desktop.  But it's confusing that WebDriver might have Rotatable added to it, when it can't actually rotate.
[2013-12-10 07:35:10] simonstewart: "If a browser supports rotation of the viewport when the user's device's screen orientation changes, and if the screen orientation can also be set in software, the "rotatability" capability MUST be returned. If the device supports rotation but not setting the orientation, the "rotatability" capability MAY be returned.
[2013-12-10 07:35:21] simonstewart: "
[2013-12-10 07:35:24] simonstewart: Something like that
[2013-12-10 07:35:36] ato: I can imagine users checking if driver instanceof Rotatable, then being surprised driver.setScreenOrientation("portrait-primary") throwing.
[2013-12-10 07:35:43] simonstewart: So can I
[2013-12-10 07:35:57] simonstewart: But it need not
[2013-12-10 07:35:57] root_empire, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-10 07:35:58] simonstewart: throw
[2013-12-10 07:36:18] ato: Good point, although that means I need to rework my Marionette patch.
[2013-12-10 07:36:19] simonstewart: What if "setScreenOrientation" returned a DOMString giving the new orientation?

[2013-12-10 07:36:59] ato: If we want to make drastic changes, mirroring the Screen Orientation API completely would make more sense.

[2013-12-10 07:37:27] ato: That returns a boolean for lockOrientation(orientation): http://www.w3.org/TR/screen-orientation/#extensions-to-the-screen-interface
[2013-12-10 07:37:44] ato: But I was concerned with backwards compatibility.

[2013-12-10 07:38:46] simonstewart: I'd rather we get this right rather than feel like we're already set in stone
[2013-12-10 07:38:54] simonstewart: Consider us as being "semi-ossified"
[2013-12-10 07:39:24] ato: But I guess changing it to be more like the Screen Orientation API doesn't mean we have to break things.
[2013-12-10 07:39:39] ato: setScreenOrientation could call down to lockOrientation for the OSS bits.
[2013-12-10 07:39:50] simonstewart: If we currently return "void" adding a return type won't make any existing code that uses the API fail to compile

[2013-12-10 08:53:39] jimevans: sahithya: yeah, but remember, the setting is zone-specific. you need to change it in each zone.

[2013-12-10 08:53:53] fuppinshire: I need to be able to do web capture by running a headless browser that exists entirely in its own process
[2013-12-10 08:54:12] fuppinshire: it can't share session information - that would cause things like me being logged in to the same site twice, running search A and B from different processes, and search A getting search B's results
[2013-12-10 08:54:46] fuppinshire: I tried using WatiN but it wasn't up to the task - because it needs to be headless I had difficulty getting WatiN to work with it
[2013-12-10 08:54:55] lukeis: did you try running two processes of phantomjs?
[2013-12-10 08:55:21] sahithya: jimevans: Thanks for your help! We know what to do now.
[2013-12-10 08:55:29] jimevans: sahithya: np.
[2013-12-10 08:55:30] lukeis: 'headless' can also be a Xvfb on linux too, right? :) (if so, you can use a 'real' browser too)
[2013-12-10 08:55:40] fuppinshire: it has to run on Windows Server :(
[2013-12-10 08:55:46] fuppinshire: and it has to be launched from a service
[2013-12-10 08:56:06] ato: simonstewart: I've changed my mind about the screen orientation stuff again.  The use case we need to cater for is a web app asking the browser to lock orientation to e.g. "portrait-primary".  What you want to test with WebDriver is that it _doesn't_ change the screen orientation of the browsing context when you tilt the device.
[2013-12-10 08:56:11] ato: simonstewart: Which is what WD needs to cater for.
[2013-12-10 08:56:12] fuppinshire: the service listens on MSMQ and then spins up new processes that are in that request queue
[2013-12-10 08:56:15] lukeis: phantomjs (ghostdriver) or htmlunitdriver will be your only options from selenium then
[2013-12-10 08:56:26] fuppinshire: I currently have this working with System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser
[2013-12-10 08:56:30] fuppinshire: by hacking it a little
[2013-12-10 08:56:43] jimevans: fuppinshire: using a service, you're begging for trouble. service processes are different from user-mode processes.
[2013-12-10 08:56:49] fuppinshire: I am well aware
[2013-12-10 08:57:06] lukeis: and thus we don't support running as a service for the 'full' browsers :)
[2013-12-10 08:57:09] fuppinshire: unfortunately I have to do at least hundreds of these as a day
[2013-12-10 08:57:16] fuppinshire: and they run concurrently
[2013-12-10 08:57:18] simonstewart: ato: sounds like you want setOrientation
[2013-12-10 08:57:22] fuppinshire: across 8-9 servers
[2013-12-10 08:57:23] jimevans: and attempting to scrape the screen is the least reliable way to get this working.
[2013-12-10 08:57:24] ato: simonstewart: So we need to clarify the distinction between WD and Screen Orientation API, while sharing the same terminology.
[2013-12-10 08:57:26] simonstewart: and then the mozilla impl will lock it
[2013-12-10 08:57:28] ato: simonstewart: Yeah, exactly.
[2013-12-10 08:57:32] simonstewart: Which is what you wrote

[2013-12-10 08:58:32] fuppinshire: also I can't interact with modal dialogues or javascript alerts at all
[2013-12-10 08:59:32] jimevans: i would almost (*almost*) be willing to bet cash money that there's a better way than automating the browser for this.
[2013-12-10 08:59:54] fuppinshire: the browser automation part just drives the navigation
[2013-12-10 09:00:00] fuppinshire: to actually scrape data out I use HtmlAgilityPack
[2013-12-10 09:00:04] fuppinshire: I'm fine with that part though
[2013-12-10 09:00:08] fuppinshire: the navigation part is the crappy part
[2013-12-10 09:00:32] fuppinshire: the current code is unmaintainable, and wouldn't allow me to, for example, write a browser plugin to automatically generate the navigation pieces
[2013-12-10 09:00:38] jimevans: i stand by my earlier statement.

[2013-12-10 09:01:38] fuppinshire: without being too specific
[2013-12-10 09:01:42] jimevans: if all you're doing is getting data off the page, there's likely a better way. you've not mentioned anything yet that indicates you need to use a full browser stack.

[2013-12-10 09:02:24] fuppinshire: selecting the correct search result
[2013-12-10 09:02:28] fuppinshire: and then pulling all the data I need from that
[2013-12-10 09:02:39] fuppinshire: in many cases I have to do more than that like make decisions about where to go next based on the content on the page
[2013-12-10 09:02:40] lukeis: still doable without a full browser
[2013-12-10 09:03:10] fuppinshire: well right now I'm just using the IE Active X Instance
[2013-12-10 09:03:13] fuppinshire: there's no browser window
[2013-12-10 09:03:30] fuppinshire: it's not actually launching IE at all
[2013-12-10 09:03:56] fuppinshire: I would prefer there not be a "real" IE instance actually because that's overhead I don't want
[2013-12-10 09:04:06] fuppinshire: and also since it's running as a service you can imagine why I don't want to interact with UI stuff
[2013-12-10 09:04:30] jimevans: yeah, but you could likely make it all happen with some combination of raw http requests (with cookies for authentication) and manipulating the web applications' search API. then again, i wonder how much of this approach is going to violate the terms of service of whatever websites you're navigating to.
[2013-12-10 09:05:22] fuppinshire: they actually know we are doing it 99% of the time

[2013-12-10 09:40:04] ato: jimevans: Any opinions on whether we should allow users to get the screen's orientation even if it's not possible to rotate the device the browser's running on?

[2013-12-10 09:43:54] jimevans: i don't know that i have a strong opinion either way. i think it'd probably be a good idea that, if the device is normally able to be rotated, but the driver has disabled that for some reason, we indicate that somehow.
[2013-12-10 09:44:11] jimevans: in that case, being able to retrieve the orientation doesn't hurt.
[2013-12-10 09:44:30] ato: Yep.
[2013-12-10 09:44:43] ato: My worry is that the name of the augmentation interface causes confusion.
[2013-12-10 09:44:45] timbo1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-10 09:45:28] jimevans: how about an isOrientationLocked() method?
[2013-12-10 09:45:33] ato: If users see that their WebDriver instanceof Rotatable evals to true, I wouldn't blame them if that leads them to think the browser can rotate.
[2013-12-10 09:46:06] grampajoe, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-10 09:46:10] ato: That's a difficult distinction to make from an implementor's point of view.
[2013-12-10 09:46:15] ato: I think.
[2013-12-10 09:46:26] jimevans: i don't know that it is.
[2013-12-10 09:46:40] jimevans: if the orientation is locked, and you try to set it, throw.
[2013-12-10 09:46:44] ato: You have the DOM Screen Orientation API that lets a web app lock the browsing context to one or several orientations.
[2013-12-10 09:46:52] santiycr, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-12-10 09:47:03] jimevans: provide the isLocked() method to let the user query.
[2013-12-10 09:47:08] jimevans: and avoid the exception
[2013-12-10 09:47:22] lukeis: +1
[2013-12-10 09:48:11] lukeis: that's html (or javascript) setting on a page?
[2013-12-10 09:48:15] ato: What problem are we solving with an isOrientationLocked() command?
[2013-12-10 09:48:18] jimevans: so isOrientationLocked() returns true if the orientation can't be changed because the driver implementation won't let it (marionette), or the page won't let it.
[2013-12-10 09:48:37] jimevans: well, i
[2013-12-10 09:48:40] ato: lukeis: JS API
[2013-12-10 09:48:50] lukeis: ato do we handle the difference between hardware orientation lock and web app orientation lock?
[2013-12-10 09:49:00] ato: That's what I'm trying to clarify (-:
[2013-12-10 09:49:05] lukeis: :)
[2013-12-10 09:49:12] ato: But that's exactly the point.
[2013-12-10 09:49:16] jimevans: well, i'm fine if you want to just throw with an appropriate error message if the orientation can't be changed. it'd be consistent with the rest of our api.
[2013-12-10 09:49:57] lukeis: well… you can "rotate" the hardware device, but the picture won't rotate with it :-/
[2013-12-10 09:50:01] lukeis: fun case
[2013-12-10 09:50:05] lukeis: "fun"
[2013-12-10 09:50:25] lukeis: and by hardware, i also mean emulator / simulator
[2013-12-10 09:50:43] jimevans: but my thinking was that if you fear confusion because the interface is named Rotatable, then providing an isOrientationLocked() would give the user some clue that there are cases where you can't control the rotation, even though the interface would indicate that you should be able to under normal circumstances.
[2013-12-10 09:51:14] ato: The use case we're trying to solve is this: A web app locks the browsing context to a given orientation, for example "landscape-primary".  They want to automate a test for that, and tries to use WebDriver to set the orientation of the device to "portrait-primary".  When they then do getScreenOrientation(), they'd expect that to still return
[2013-12-10 09:51:14] ato: "landscape-primary" because it wasn't possible to change the orienation.
[2013-12-10 09:51:24] llaskin, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-10 09:51:59] jimevans: sounds like we have multiple orientations we need to deal with. device orientation and page orientation.
[2013-12-10 09:52:06] lukeis: we need two endpoints related to orientation then… one for hardware, one for the 'page'
[2013-12-10 09:52:09] ato: So get and set here would really behave quite differently.  The getter would query the actual orientation of the browsing context, whereas the setter would update the device's actual physical orientation.
[2013-12-10 09:52:15] ato: jimevans: Exactly.
[2013-12-10 09:52:59] jimevans: however, we already have an api to deal with page orientation - the javascript DOM api.
[2013-12-10 09:53:03] lukeis: hmm, i would want to be able to query both hardware and browsing context
[2013-12-10 09:53:10] lukeis: yeah
[2013-12-10 09:54:11] lukeis: driver.getOrientation() <- hardware…. driver.executeScript("return window.orientation") (or whatever it is) <- browsing context ?
[2013-12-10 09:59:24] ato: Yes.
[2013-12-10 09:59:46] ato: So for consistencies sake, should we remove getScreenOrientation altogether?
[2013-12-10 10:00:23] lukeis: to have just getOrientation instead?
[2013-12-10 10:00:45] ato: I mean, just setScreenOrientation to control the “hardware” side of things.

[2013-12-10 11:55:18] wrench: Heys, I'm using the python bindings w/ webdriver and python unittest. I have a test method that successfully authenticates w/ the login page and checks the title. Now I want to write more test methods. I noticed that I can't use the same webdriver instance from the first method in the second method. Does that mean that every single test method I write has to reconnect and reauthenticate w/ the site before it can test anything?

[2013-12-10 11:57:16] lukeis: you can certainly "share" the instance of the driver… but then you're reducing your ability to run tests in parallel
[2013-12-10 11:58:47] lukeis: whatever you end up choosing, there's trade offs :)  (and you shouldn't necessarily have to do the 'full' login flow with webdriver everytime, for example we use an API call to get a session id and then set the session id cookie in the browser)
[2013-12-10 11:59:28] wrench: hrmm I need to research using session id
[2013-12-10 11:59:31] wrench: thanks for the info
[2013-12-10 11:59:49] wrench: I hadn't even thought about testing in parallel -- as the number of tests grow -- seems useful

[2013-12-10 12:34:01] fuppinshire: phantomjs is also insanely fast compared to the IE ActiveX object
[2013-12-10 12:34:16] fuppinshire: glory and approbation to IWebDriver
[2013-12-10 12:34:39] fuppinshire: so I could run one of them there Selenium grids to distribute load for these babies too
[2013-12-10 12:34:50] fuppinshire: which would eliminate the need for the stupid service also
[2013-12-10 12:34:59] fuppinshire: then I could choose whether or not I wanted to run it in a UI or not
[2013-12-10 12:35:03] lukeis: when you don't have to render everything and download a whole stack of extra assets (images)… of course it'll be faster ;)
[2013-12-10 12:35:40] fuppinshire: yeah I think there's still gonna be some sites where I'll have to render them

[2013-12-10 23:54:21] Cliff123: add the jar to the classpath
