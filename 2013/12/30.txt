[2013-12-30 06:39:38] simplex_: how can i take a screenshot of the whole page with chromedriver? the screenshots i take sre only from the visible part...
[2013-12-30 06:40:04] simplex_: with other drivers it is the whole page...
[2013-12-30 06:40:10] simplex_: ?
[2013-12-30 06:40:42] jack090: Typically it's just what is in the browser frame
[2013-12-30 06:41:16] jack090: There are ways to get a screenshot

[2013-12-30 06:56:05] jack090: if you want title bar etc.. you'll have to invoke a different API to screen capture.
[2013-12-30 06:56:29] simplex_: resize the window -> take the screenshot -> resize back...
[2013-12-30 06:56:38] simplex_: thats how i do it atm

[2013-12-30 07:04:42] testersel: can anyone help me on this please
[2013-12-30 07:04:51] jack090: It was fairly easy if I recall. I think I maximize the browser window to be outside the screen scope then take screenshot then flip it back

[2013-12-30 07:25:43] simplex_: well i just fire up many instances and it gets quite slow after 15 or so... so i thought disabling everything that is not used would be the best way...

[2013-12-30 10:45:16] Koganei: hey guys, I was wondering if it was possible to take a screenshot while the page was loading. It seems that it waits til the page finishes loading before taking the screenshot
[2013-12-30 10:47:06] jimevans: Koganei: since a "screenshot" in webdriver is defined as "full-DOM rendering", screenshots will have to wait for the full page to load, by definition.

[2013-12-30 10:47:59] Koganei: hmm okay :o
[2013-12-30 10:48:09] DrJenkins, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-30 10:48:27] jack090: jimevans someone was asking about chromedriver not taking a full screenshot (only what's currently in frame)
[2013-12-30 10:48:46] jimevans: now, that's assuming you use webdriver. selenium rc may be different (i sincerely doubt it), but since i refuse to answer questions about selenium rc, someone else would have to help there.
[2013-12-30 10:48:49] jack090: would you know if that's a chromedriver limitation or selenium?
[2013-12-30 10:49:02] Koganei: so if I want to see what the page looks like while it's loading, I'd have to use the OS screenshot or smthing
[2013-12-30 10:49:18] jimevans: jack090: that's a bug in chromedriver. limited by a bug in chromium. the chromium bug has been around for 3+ years.
[2013-12-30 10:49:27] jimevans: Koganei: yep, sounds like
[2013-12-30 10:49:43] Koganei: kk thanks man
[2013-12-30 10:49:49] jimevans: np
[2013-12-30 10:49:50] jack090: Koganei yes.. if you are using C# or Java you can invoke methods that use OS screenshot capabilities
[2013-12-30 10:50:21] jack090: jimevans: I think it worked in chromedriver1 and not 2
[2013-12-30 10:50:39] Koganei: jack090: yeah that was my thinking
[2013-12-30 10:50:48] Koganei: I wonder if there's a way to know page load time though
[2013-12-30 10:50:58] Koganei: like "this is what the page looks like after 0.2s, after 0.8s, etc
[2013-12-30 10:51:05] jack090: correct

[2013-12-30 12:09:42] lukeis: yeah... but as a reader of the logs on occaison (on my phone) it's quite annoying to not easily see real conversation :)
[2013-12-30 12:09:53] jimevans: oh, there is that too, i suppose.
[2013-12-30 12:10:17] lukeis: i might just change the logging bot to ignore leaves/ joins
