I'm getting a 405 error out of it, but it seems to be building things close to correctly, except the final command url looks strange, but I'm not sure how selenium is 'setting' things like this via url calls
[2013-12-18 07:25:55] jimevans: rick_h__: the webdriver language bindings use http POST calls to set data.

[2013-12-18 07:26:58] rick_h__: jimevans: yep, I traced the code to see that, and the post calls for setting implicit wait and script timeout work fine
[2013-12-18 07:27:12] kedoodek, quitting. (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[2013-12-18 07:27:24] rick_h__: jimevans: but the one for page load timeout failed. The only different I could see in the requests generated was that the page load timeout one had an extra param of a 'type': 'pageTimeout'
[2013-12-18 07:27:53] rick_h__: I'm guessing that the 405 was due to the internals rejecting the command, but it's in the api docs and I couldn't seem to understand why it hated me on that one timeout
[2013-12-18 07:28:37] ato: Selenium loves everyone.  It's nothing personal.
[2013-12-18 07:28:41] jimevans: rick_h__: a couple of questions. which language binding are you using (looks like python or ruby, but i can't be sure)? and what browser are you having the issue with (does it happen for all, or just one)?
[2013-12-18 07:28:47] rick_h__: jimevans: python
[2013-12-18 07:28:59] rick_h__: jimevans: I only tried chrome, it's using the remote webdriver
[2013-12-18 07:29:11] jimevans: try firefox. see what happens.
[2013-12-18 07:29:18] ato: 405 would indicate that it's not accepting the POST it's getting.
[2013-12-18 07:29:23] rick_h__: jimevans: I'll be adding more browsers as a next step, so I'll see if it works on others. I'm trying to get it going on saucelabs for several browsers.
[2013-12-18 07:29:41] rick_h__: ato: :) I feel hated by software too easily.
[2013-12-18 07:29:51] jimevans: iirc, chrome driver didn't have page load time out implemented for a good while.
[2013-12-18 07:29:58] rick_h__: ato: but yea, I figured the request must be bad, or not accepted, but I couldn't find anything to give me a hint as to why and it looked very supported
[2013-12-18 07:30:19] ato: rick_h__: Well if it's not supported it's a problem with the driver you're using, and not with Selenium.
[2013-12-18 07:30:19] rick_h__: jimevans: cool, yea noticed some history, but most of that was from 2012 and older in the searching I was doing
[2013-12-18 07:30:45] jimevans: ato: that's what that 405 response code *should* indicate. it's still up to the remote end to implement the protocol correctly.
[2013-12-18 07:30:48] jigal: hello when i do  $this->fillField('fp_title_n0', $arg1); i get the error that this field doesn't exist while I am 1000% and have seen that the field exists. How could I possibly solve this?
[2013-12-18 07:30:59] rick_h__: ato: understood. For now I'm trying the 'manually set a socket default timeout' in python, but curious if I was hitting something known
[2013-12-18 07:31:01] ato: jimevans: Hey, I'm just guessing.
[2013-12-18 07:31:08] ato: jimevans: i'm a tepot
[2013-12-18 07:31:10] ato: teapot
[2013-12-18 07:31:16] jimevans: jigal: what is that? fillField isn't raw selenium rc, or webdriver.
[2013-12-18 07:31:36] jimevans: plus it looks like php, which isn't a language i use or know much about.
[2013-12-18 07:31:53] jimevans: (or maybe perl)
[2013-12-18 07:32:05] ato: Perl doesn't look like that. (-

[2013-12-18 07:32:08] jimevans: (but in any case, the project doesn't have those language bindings natively anyway)

[2013-12-18 07:56:10] kedoodek, quitting. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2013-12-18 07:56:30] nirvdrum: Well, there's one that's not quite grid related, but if you run a grid you'll almost certainly hit it.  Our LoggingHandler leaks entries . . . a lot.
[2013-12-18 07:57:14] nirvdrum: We return a strong ref in LoggingHandler#getRecords, so when we flush the handler, it doesn't really matter.  Anything that called getRecords keeps the previous entries alive.

[2013-12-18 07:57:43] nirvdrum: I think just using a weak ref there will be sufficient.
[2013-12-18 07:58:07] nirvdrum: There's a pretty bad memory leak in BMP I want to plug, too.
[2013-12-18 07:58:08] DrJenkins, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-18 07:58:23] nirvdrum: And there's a big memory leak in the new grid console.
[2013-12-18 07:58:46] zeljkof-away, changing nick to zeljkof.
[2013-12-18 07:58:48] nirvdrum: That is, if the page doesn't timeout first.  It's effectively unusable for grids with more than 10 nodes.
[2013-12-18 07:59:40] nirvdrum: Beyond that, I suspect a lot of the issue tracker is non-issues or trivial things.  Grid seems to be running fairly solidly for everyone I know running a largish grid.
[2013-12-18 08:00:11] jimevans: i'm lazy and can't find the test that specifies this explicitly. getTitle() returns title of the top-level frame or focused frame?
[2013-12-18 08:00:41] Dave_B_: grid works pretty weell so long as you stick to the old console :)

[2013-12-18 10:46:35] Dude-X: another problem i have is, is that this currency follows the belief that the money supply should be limited. in the 18-19th century, this idea only hurt people like farmers who needed money to continue farming
[2013-12-18 10:46:38] dimacus: i'll buy this piece of toilet paper for 1million dogecoins!
[2013-12-18 10:47:00] dimacus: Dude-X:  money suply should be limited otherwise you have hyper inflations

[2013-12-18 10:48:08] dimacus: there is a reason that Russia is sitting on a crap load of diamonds in siberia. They could crash the entire diamond market if they start to mine it
[2013-12-18 10:48:14] p_l: (for example, print money to pay *people* so they spend their windfall on things they wouldn't have normally bought, essentially adding value to the money)

[2013-12-18 10:48:28] p_l: they sit on it because diamonds are worthless
[2013-12-18 10:48:35] dimacus: they are worthless
[2013-12-18 10:48:42] p_l: (since late 19th century or so)
[2013-12-18 10:48:49] Dude-X: diamonds have articial value
[2013-12-18 10:49:05] Dude-X: and now they can be me made with machiens
[2013-12-18 10:49:16] p_l: Dude-X: when you pay for diamonds at jeweler you pay something like >500% in markup
[2013-12-18 10:49:19] dimacus: but the supply is relatively low so the fact that there is so few of them that brings value up
[2013-12-18 10:49:27] p_l: dimacus: the supply is *fukchuge*
[2013-12-18 10:49:34] p_l: *fukchuge*

[2013-12-18 10:52:17] p_l: dimacus: solution - don't buy diamond engagement ring. Since it's artificial tradition manufactured by the same group that controlled diamond prices despite the real supply going up like crazy
[2013-12-18 10:52:40] Dude-X: i paid 200 dollars for an engagement with a .5 carat diamond. my wife loves it.
[2013-12-18 10:52:43] dimacus: even then diamond engagment ring is relatively recent development
[2013-12-18 10:52:51] dimacus: 1800 i believe the tradition started
[2013-12-18 10:52:52] p_l: at my friends university they equipped one of the labs with windows made of diamond. The cost? Few hours of graduate's works :>
[2013-12-18 10:52:57] p_l: dimacus: later
[2013-12-18 10:53:00] Dude-X: more like 1940's
[2013-12-18 10:53:03] dimacus: better still
[2013-12-18 10:53:08] p_l: late 1800s in USA
[2013-12-18 10:53:11] dimacus: hate those traditions tha tmake 0 sense
[2013-12-18 10:53:34] Dude-X: if you wonder why there's an expensive tradition, think like a Ferengi,
[2013-12-18 10:53:35] dimacus: we have a shit load of diamonds no one wants… lets find a way to make money
[2013-12-18 10:53:48] dimacus: step 1: make everyone feel insecure about not having diamons
[2013-12-18 10:53:53] dimacus: step 2: raise prices
[2013-12-18 10:53:59] dimacus: step 3: smoke a giant cigar
[2013-12-18 10:54:12] p_l: dimacus: it started more like "oh shit, we found so much diamond we can cover our existing demand for a 100 years)
[2013-12-18 10:54:16] Dude-X: well the genius of debeers is getting people to buy diamonds and not resell them

[2013-12-18 11:10:39] dogarrhea: Mixed content https is just the way IE works.
[2013-12-18 11:10:50] dogarrhea: that popup.

[2013-12-18 11:11:12] dogarrhea: lukeis the site itself may not offer https
[2013-12-18 11:11:24] dogarrhea: www.sprint.com might just be plain http
[2013-12-18 11:11:57] dogarrhea: so the point that there's a bug is moot
[2013-12-18 11:12:20] dogarrhea: it's an IE specific behavior.  Is the solution just to check !Theres_An_IE_Popup
[2013-12-18 11:12:41] lukeis: but the general answer to your question was in PageObjects you could have a factory of some kind that returned a different impl depending on Browser (or just do an 'if' condition in the PageObject if the difference is trivial)
[2013-12-18 11:13:19] dimacus: dogarrhea: is there an IE specific registry bit flip you can turn off the pop up?
[2013-12-18 11:13:38] dogarrhea: I'm sure there's a setting you can configure for sure
[2013-12-18 11:13:43] lukeis: that shouldn't be a question ;)

[2013-12-18 14:53:55] jimevans: define "visible". if by "visible" you mean, "i can see it on the page," that doesn't mean it necessarily meets webdriver's criteria of "visible". and in order to help further, you'll need to provide a sample of HTML that repros the issue.

[2013-12-18 22:29:57] bark_: Hi. How to bind selenium-server-standalone to an ip address? It's only accessible on http://localhost:4444/wb/hub now. I want something like 192.168.1.50...

[2013-12-18 22:54:36] casey0: im using selenium python with webdriver.PhantomJS() and passing a socks 5 proxy in the service args.  it works, but takes like 5-6 minutes when using a proxy.  im wondering how i can speed this up?  without a proxy it is still pretty slow, but not nearly as slow as with one.
