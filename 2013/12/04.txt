Been struggling with getting it to work for a couple of days and google hasn't been any help. the IDE worked beautifully but I want to establish a hub system with multiple platforms and browsers, which is why I'm testing the server on my system now.
[2013-12-04 06:13:24] tlousky: I tried both server versions 2.37 and 2.32. I can run the server well through java -jar, and it also loads the web gui on http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
[2013-12-04 06:13:47] AdamDangoor, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2013-12-04 06:13:57] tlousky: but it won't create a session through the web-gui, nor through a python script that creates a new remote webdriver

[2013-12-04 06:28:57] ato: That sounds right.

[2013-12-04 06:29:25] BadPtr: (y)
[2013-12-04 06:29:28] ato: I think it will release all keys at the end of a chain.
[2013-12-04 06:31:26] BadPtr: not too sure how to perform it on a specific element, though?
[2013-12-04 06:31:45] BadPtr: pretty sure I have the chain right, but how do I run it on my $s->element(...) ?

[2013-12-04 06:36:15] ato: BadPtr: So to have an action chain interact with an element you must first select the element, or pass along an element reference to it.
[2013-12-04 06:36:51] ato: BadPtr: So a.moveToElement(el).click().keyDown("Control").sendKeys("Enter").perform()

[2013-12-04 06:38:07] jimevans: i'm trying to track down what chromedriver uses for its http server library.
[2013-12-04 06:38:26] ato: chromedriver1 used mongoose.  chromedriver2 uses net::http I think.
[2013-12-04 06:38:37] ato: Which is an internal Chromium HTTP server.
[2013-12-04 06:38:57] jimevans: yeah, i knew they used mongoose at one point.
[2013-12-04 06:39:12] jimevans: which is what i'm needing to move away from.
[2013-12-04 06:39:39] ato: kkania wrote something to the Chromium dev list a few months back about some migration to a different server.  Not sure if that was the Chromium one they have in their base libraries or something else.
[2013-12-04 06:39:54] ato: As far as I remember, Chromium has two different HTTP servers.
[2013-12-04 06:40:12] jimevans: went to look at the latest mongoose updates, and they've changed their license to a gpl license, which i won't use.
[2013-12-04 06:40:28] ato: Well GPL is Apache 2 compliant, but I hear you.
[2013-12-04 06:41:28] jimevans: there's an mit licensed fork, but the http server has always been a weak point in the IE driver, so i periodically look for alternatives anyway.
[2013-12-04 06:41:47] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-04 06:41:54] jimevans: the tricky bit is that it has to work on windows, and many oss http servers are linux-variant-only.

[2013-12-04 08:14:17] simonsimon: Selenium IDE question.  I've created my own custom locateElementByMenuItem and added a LocatorBuilder that return menuitem=xxx.  When I am recording with the IDE, I see the clickAndWait menuitem=xxx target.  The problem is that when I replay my scenario, I get a [error] Unrecognised locator type: 'menuitem' message.  Any pointers on why?

[2013-12-04 09:27:23] jimevans: what i was having issues with was trying to switch to a frame by getting the frame element was failing if the findElement call happened after a switchTo().defaultContent()
[2013-12-04 09:27:36] jimevans: it was telling me the found element isn't a frame or iframe.
[2013-12-04 09:28:19] jimevans: and dumping the properties of the found element shows that to be very true. the found element turns out to be the top level window object (!)
[2013-12-04 09:28:47] jimevans: but i don't have any idea why the findElement would be throwing the window object into the cache.

[2013-12-04 09:30:24] jimevans: jleyba: so where should i tart looking?
[2013-12-04 09:30:26] nullx: or wait till the url is fully loaded (eg to take a proper screenshot)
[2013-12-04 09:30:33] nullx: or does that only exist in the Java binding?

[2013-12-04 09:31:02] nullx: it's not in C#

[2013-12-04 09:35:41] nullx: Is there any way beyond webdriverwait to do something like.. do this until url is something? the phantom js binding crashes if I do while(driver.url != newUrl), but firefox/chrome are fine with it.,.

[2013-12-04 09:36:28] nullx: Dude-X: PhantomJS is the best one of the bunch, from what I can tell... which is unexpected really.
[2013-12-04 09:36:29] Dude-X: maybe it's a bug with calling driver.url many times.
[2013-12-04 09:36:31] nullx: except that
[2013-12-04 09:36:35] jleyba: no worries jimevans... for every rant/complaint I post in this channel, I hold back 3 more
[2013-12-04 09:36:35] nullx: yeah
[2013-12-04 09:36:42] nullx: It really will call it again and again every milisecond or something
[2013-12-04 09:36:45] *jleyba wants those damn kids to stay off his lawn'
[2013-12-04 09:36:55] jimevans: jleyba: the implementation of defaultContent() calls down to webdriver.atoms.inject.frame.defaultContent
[2013-12-04 09:36:57] Dude-X: the default is 500 msec
[2013-12-04 09:37:07] Dude-X: nullx: try changing the default wait interval
[2013-12-04 09:37:07] nullx: Dude-X: oh you mean it will wait anyway?
[2013-12-04 09:37:13] nullx: explain?
[2013-12-04 09:37:24] nullx: so the get/setter waits anyway?
[2013-12-04 09:37:32] nullx: if it did that, it'd be fine yeah
[2013-12-04 09:37:37] nullx: half a second (500ms) is fine
[2013-12-04 09:37:38] Dude-X: web driver wait will attempt the action first, if it gets a False, it will sleep for .5 seconds
[2013-12-04 09:38:00] Dude-X: maybe change your intervals to .8 seconds as a work around
[2013-12-04 09:38:02] lukeis: nullx:  in python -  WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(lambda d : d.url == newUrl)
[2013-12-04 09:38:06] nullx: yeah
[2013-12-04 09:38:18] jimevans: and (in c#) if you find the poll interval is too short or long, you can use DefaultWait<T> instead of WebDriverWait.

[2013-12-04 09:38:35] jleyba: jimevans: webdriver.atoms.inject.frame.defaultContent calls bot.frame.defaultContent, which returns a Window object
[2013-12-04 09:38:42] Dave_B_: i think i had issues previously with phantomjs not liking you to ask for it's url if the page is loading
[2013-12-04 09:38:46] jleyba: that's how a Window is added to the cache

[2013-12-04 09:42:34] nullx: there isn't a huge level of abstraction going on for me.. I get screenshots from a lot of pages, that's the whole nine yards of what I do.

[2013-12-04 09:42:45] jleyba: nodejs is fun to play with, but i don't think it's mature enough for a serious project
[2013-12-04 09:42:47] nullx: while(driver.url != url); is what I do

[2013-12-04 11:23:28] phasze: what I like to do in our product is wait for all ajax calls to be done
[2013-12-04 11:23:35] nullx: How can I be sure though?
[2013-12-04 11:23:42] nullx: I know firefox does it, PhantomJS sometimes is incorrect
[2013-12-04 11:23:54] phasze: a good practice is to wait for what usually loads last in the page to be there or what you're interacting with to be there
[2013-12-04 11:24:02] nullx: right
[2013-12-04 11:24:06] nullx: but there's no generic way right?
[2013-12-04 11:24:21] nullx: because I really would have to check per page to figure that out, which for my project is not very practical
[2013-12-04 11:24:33] nullx: driver.url is blocking right?
[2013-12-04 11:24:37] nullx: blocks until its loaded in theory?

[2013-12-04 11:25:48] jimevans: nullx: "when is my page fully loaded" is a question that's nearly impossible to answer 100% of the time for all pages, particularly in the javascript-heavy world of today's web.
[2013-12-04 11:25:51] phasze: but I still tell my testers to wait for the element they're interacting with to be present

[2013-12-04 11:28:41] jimevans: driver.get (setting the driver.Url property in .NET) will make a "best faith" effort to wait as best it can.
[2013-12-04 11:28:51] nullx: ooh
[2013-12-04 11:28:55] nullx: so driver.get instead of driver.url?
[2013-12-04 11:29:08] lumberg: So what's the deal with CSS :hover psedo classes.  Can they be activated with WebDriver Native Elements support?  Can't seem to find a straight answer.

[2013-12-04 11:37:43] jimevans: lumberg: with native events, should do. synthetic (javascript-only) events, not so much.
[2013-12-04 11:40:44] lumberg: jimevans: OK, and I see from this list that there are browsers that support Native Events (https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/AdvancedUserInteractions#Native_events_versus_synthetic_events) but I dont see a browser version list there.  Can I expect problems with older browsers or newer browsers that haven't gotten a driver update?

[2013-12-04 11:43:08] nullx: native events as in the same event loop as Windows GUI events?
[2013-12-04 11:43:19] jleyba: nullx: we use the term native events loosely

[2013-12-04 11:43:35] jleyba: basically each driver tricks the browser into thinking there was a native key press. how it does that is implementation specific

[2013-12-04 11:49:15] jleyba: jimevans can give more specifics, but I believe the IEDriver shoves events directly into the window handle's event queue
[2013-12-04 11:49:28] jleyba: (using COM)
[2013-12-04 11:49:54] jimevans: the IE driver uses the SendMessage API by default. there's an option to use the (more correct, but more problematic) SendInput API.

[2013-12-04 12:34:54] intchanter-work: nullx: On the waiting question, if you're using page maps or page objects, you can include an element for your code to check.
[2013-12-04 12:35:08] intchanter-work: That at least prevents duplicating that information throughout your tests or scripts.
[2013-12-04 12:35:15] nullx: intchanter-work - unfortuantely this is testing production sites and it would not really be possible most of the time

[2013-12-04 12:36:07] intchanter-work: Oh, not changing the page, just storing the selector that maps to the element that would indicate the page is ready.
[2013-12-04 12:36:58] intchanter-work: So I have things with a map like this {'signup_button': '...selector...', ... , 'wait_for': '...selector'}

[2013-12-04 12:37:54] intchanter-work: And then the code that needs to wait just looks for the element specified by the selector stored as 'wait_for'.
[2013-12-04 12:39:35] intchanter-work: Then, depending on the page, I either set the 'wait_for' selector to be something near the end of the page (if it's somewhat static), or something that will be present only after the initial AJAX-y work is (mostly) done.

[2013-12-04 13:13:37] brockfredin: I'm using the alert feature.  How come I can't do: alert.sendKeys(Keys.Enter); I get this error: The method sendKeys(String) in the type Alert is not applicable for the arguments (Keys)
[2013-12-04 13:14:46] jimevans: brockfredin: because sendKeys is only supposed to be used for javascript prompt() dialogs.
[2013-12-04 13:15:21] jimevans: use accept() or dismiss() to close the alert.

[2013-12-04 13:20:12] Dude-X: that's what i thought
[2013-12-04 13:20:36] jimevans: brockfredin: in other words, don't attempt to use the alerts api for file selection dialogs, dialogs displayed using showModalDialog(), or for HTML constructs like lightboxes that look like alerts but really aren't.
[2013-12-04 13:20:54] jimevans: you're begging for disappointment if you do
[2013-12-04 13:21:43] Dude-X: i've seen the term lately light boxes for what i've seen traditionally called modal overlays
[2013-12-04 13:22:15] jimevans: whatever you call them, they are explicitly *not* alerts.
[2013-12-04 13:22:17] simplex_: would be cool though.. i try xpath now, like phasze suggested - thanks btw
[2013-12-04 13:23:16] Dude-X: jimevans: though what's disorienting though is that the latest browsers now skin alert boxes
[2013-12-04 13:23:27] Dude-X: they sometimes resemble lightboxes
[2013-12-04 13:23:43] jimevans: any web development framework that forces your automation to use partial ids to automate it (and doesn't give the developer the ability to override it) is hindering the development effort, and should be replaced.

[2013-12-04 13:37:24] jimevans: but if the page refreshes or modifies the DOM once the alert is closed (a distinct possibility), your element references may no longer be valid.

[2013-12-04 13:41:59] brockfredin: By the way, Eclipse Debugging blows.  Most of the time, it doesn't even recognize breakpoints.
[2013-12-04 13:42:39] jimevans: it sounds like you have an "edit" button that throws your page into edit mode, after confirming that's what you really want to do with a javascript alert.
[2013-12-04 13:43:08] simplex_: funny: same function, awesomium: 220 lines, selenium: 40 lines :)
[2013-12-04 13:43:54] brockfredin: jimevans http://picpaste.com/friedChicken-1xjf9DkO.jpg
[2013-12-04 13:43:57] jimevans: i'd guess that, since you find all of the elements you're going to be sending keys to before you click the edit button, the application re-adds the (now-editable) elements into the DOM after you've confirmed you want to edit the record, so all of those elements you spent time finding before the click are now invalid.
[2013-12-04 13:45:08] brockfredin: jimevans Ah, I see.  One of those.  Hmm.
[2013-12-04 13:45:33] admc, joining. (#selenium)

[2013-12-04 13:48:50] brockfredin: jimevans Line 20 or so.  I htink your analysis was exact.  I'm still playing and debugging with it.
[2013-12-04 13:49:25] jimevans: you're also running the risk of IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions by blindly calling get(0) on the element lists.
[2013-12-04 13:49:29] jimevans: but that's another matter.
[2013-12-04 13:50:17] brockfredin: jimevans That's the exact error that came up.
[2013-12-04 13:52:50] brockfredin: What just call the iterator instead of the o index?

[2013-12-04 13:54:47] simplex_: can i sell an application which uses selenium?
[2013-12-04 13:54:55] jimevans: and trying to avoid doing the right thing by writing a helper function. probably because you think it'll make your code "look cleaner"

[2013-12-04 13:57:19] jimevans: brockfredin: why aren't you using your getElement() function for the edit field elements?
[2013-12-04 13:58:16] brockfredin: That feature of mine doesn't contain an iterator to compare the ID values and a specific iterator that happens with additional boxes that are added based on user edits.

[2013-12-04 15:08:00] lukeis: jason assured me we shouldn't be too concerned by chrome… but yeah, i'm not sure… i think we need santiycr to confirm those jobs are really running what they say they are running (chromedriver 2.7, chrome 30)

[2013-12-04 15:14:55] jleyba: not really possible
[2013-12-04 15:15:08] jleyba: best practice is to write a wait condition that checks for the presence of some element in the DOM
[2013-12-04 15:16:47] simplex_: ok. i thought maybe there's a method in which i do not have to specify a specific element...
[2013-12-04 15:17:17] simplex_: but i'm gonna use WebDriverWait then. thanks!
