[2013-12-31 04:51:29] detronizator_: Well, I'm in London - not "new year yet" either
[2013-12-31 04:51:35] detronizator_: just wanting to go ahdead wit the work
[2013-12-31 04:52:03] detronizator_: anyone I can ask questions about https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/default/webdriver-spec.html#typing-keys logged in?
[2013-12-31 04:52:11] detronizator_: AutomatedTester: for example?
[2013-12-31 04:52:14] Dave_B_: :ask
[2013-12-31 04:52:14] selbot2___: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[2013-12-31 04:52:57] detronizator_: so, I got (again!) an issue with people saying "Firefox works, why it doesn't with Phantom???"
[2013-12-31 04:53:06] detronizator_: and this time is about "\n" at the end of a sendKeys
[2013-12-31 04:53:26] detronizator_: I have checked and both FF and Chrome seem to "wait" for page to load implicitly
[2013-12-31 04:53:38] detronizator_: i say "seems" asa I haven't checked the source code
[2013-12-31 04:53:56] detronizator_: but tests seem to support that
[2013-12-31 04:54:27] detronizator_: while phantomjs doesn't, and returns giving space to a new command to be executed (while in the background the page is ACTUALLY loading)
[2013-12-31 04:54:59] detronizator_: of course, when I say "\n" at the end of sendKeys, I'm implicitly depicting a form submission (sorry if I wasn't clear)
[2013-12-31 04:55:21] detronizator_: all that said, the specs DO NOT specify anything about this scenario
[2013-12-31 04:55:26] detronizator_: what should I do???
[2013-12-31 05:00:36] detronizator_: Dave_B_: you see? I asked because I knew everyone is stuffing their Turkey right now ;)
