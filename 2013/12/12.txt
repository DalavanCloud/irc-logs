[2013-12-12 05:34:56] ato: The typical use case for WebDriver is that you try setting the device orientation to landscape.  If the web app is locked to only portrait, you should be able to check that the two differ.
[2013-12-12 05:35:07] ato: I.e. setting the orientation to landscape wouldn't change the app's orientation.

[2013-12-12 06:26:01] simonstewart: Ah. Not sure
[2013-12-12 06:26:18] simonstewart: But it's a wildly popular framework, so most job sites should show something useful if you do a search for it

[2013-12-12 06:26:59] jimevans: ato: i have a native .NET marionette client that works around the current wire-protocol incompatibilities.
[2013-12-12 06:27:12] tulasi: any sample projcts is there on selenium for my practice
[2013-12-12 06:27:55] ato: jimevans: I know, I've looked at it.  barancev also did one for Java.  And AutomatedTester one for Python.
[2013-12-12 06:28:07] ato: They are all slightly incompatible and none of them cover everything (-:
[2013-12-12 06:28:32] barancev: Java client is outdated I think
[2013-12-12 06:28:41] ato: So we're trying to make things simpler by being more webdriver compatible, so that clients could be more or less a direct wire protocol → socket conversion.
[2013-12-12 06:29:08] ato: barancev: It was great help though (-:
[2013-12-12 06:29:10] jimevans: ato: as is any publicly available .net client. the up-to-date version only exists in a git branch on my local machine.
[2013-12-12 06:29:24] jimevans: (outdated, that is)

[2013-12-12 06:31:58] ato: barancev: I'll crossreference that against the webdriver tracking bug.
[2013-12-12 06:32:11] barancev: ok
[2013-12-12 06:32:43] barancev: these issues were gathered from Selenium tests executed agains early Marionette release
[2013-12-12 06:32:46] jimevans: the frame issue is tracked by a separate bug.
[2013-12-12 06:32:57] jimevans: in bugzilla
[2013-12-12 06:33:24] barancev: btw, why do we have switchTo().frame() by index and string?
[2013-12-12 06:33:26] DrJenkins, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-12 06:33:28] ato: AutomatedTester did one that fixed most of the issues, with the exception of some minor edge cases I believe.
[2013-12-12 06:33:36] barancev: let's deprecate these methods
[2013-12-12 06:33:37] ato: one, as in a patch
[2013-12-12 06:33:43] barancev: and force use of WebElement
[2013-12-12 06:33:49] jimevans: ato: iirc, his fix broke b2g.

[2013-12-12 06:34:10] simonstewart: lots of people just use the name or id
[2013-12-12 06:34:16] ato: jimevans: RIght, okay.  I didn't run the full test suite on the emulator.
[2013-12-12 06:34:23] tulasi: thanks
[2013-12-12 06:34:37] ato: jimevans: (It… takes… forever!)
[2013-12-12 06:34:40] barancev: simonstewart: so findElement(By.NameOrId(...)) would solve the need
[2013-12-12 06:34:52] jimevans: ato: but last time i checked in with him about it, he had another approach he was going to work on.
[2013-12-12 06:35:16] ato: Cool.  That should resolve like 80 % of the initial issues you were seeing IIRC.
[2013-12-12 06:35:19] simonstewart: Meta-question: why change this now?
[2013-12-12 06:35:21] barancev: switching to a webelement is more explicit
[2013-12-12 06:35:24] tulasi: it is not working
[2013-12-12 06:35:30] ato: bbib
[2013-12-12 06:35:33] barancev: and it minifies the API

[2013-12-12 06:36:30] simonstewart: it could just boil down a single wire protocol url

[2013-12-12 06:36:45] simonstewart: right
[2013-12-12 06:37:01] jimevans: in .net it's a single method, with overloads.
[2013-12-12 06:37:04] simonstewart: (sorry, hacking on day job stuff right now, so not got all the context for the webdriver protocol in my head)
[2013-12-12 06:37:07] barancev: a single URL with 3 different semantics
[2013-12-12 06:37:07] jimevans: (java too, iirc)
[2013-12-12 06:37:07] simonstewart: ditto java
[2013-12-12 06:37:13] tulasi: hello please any one help me

[2013-12-12 06:42:16] jimevans: barancev: that seems ambiguous to me. all of the By incarnations take a string as location criteria. it would seem odd to me to special case id or name vs., say, xpath or css selector.
[2013-12-12 06:43:10] barancev: jimevans: right, the same logic can (and should) be applied to frame location strategies
[2013-12-12 06:43:34] barancev: switchTo().frame(By locator) would be good solution too

[2013-12-12 06:45:04] jimevans: barancev: i disagree because frames are fundamentally different than elements (c.f. javascript's window.frames), but i'm not going to argue the point.
[2013-12-12 06:45:33] simonstewart: Switching by index and name were both very webdriver-ish at one point
[2013-12-12 06:45:44] barancev: they was, may be
[2013-12-12 06:45:44] simonstewart: They still, as jimevans points out, make a lot of sense
[2013-12-12 06:45:51] barancev: but API changed sinse
[2013-12-12 06:46:06] simonstewart: the frame switching api is modeled after indexing into window.frames
[2013-12-12 06:46:21] simonstewart: adding the webelement version was relatively recent
[2013-12-12 06:47:39] barancev: jimevans: there is document.images, so what? should we add a method to look for an image by index?
[2013-12-12 06:48:39] jimevans: barancev: now you're just being disingenuous. switching frames is *different* (because of execution context). and you know it.
[2013-12-12 06:48:40] barancev: these "technical" explanations make sense, but we're talking about API
[2013-12-12 06:49:10] barancev: no ned to mimic javascript, even for frames

[2013-12-12 06:50:26] barancev: "adding the webelement version was relatively recent" <- right, and as soon as this new method added old ones can be deprecated
[2013-12-12 06:50:47] simonstewart: I happen to disagree in this case

[2013-12-12 06:51:45] simonstewart: What would you clean up?
[2013-12-12 06:52:06] barancev: let's look from 'waiting' implementation point
[2013-12-12 06:52:30] simonstewart: I really wish I knew where this was coming from
[2013-12-12 06:52:31] barancev: does implicit wait work if we switch to a frame by index?
[2013-12-12 06:52:57] jimevans: i hate having methods that take no parameters, but return a value. they should be properties. but properties should be named nouns, not verbs. "SwitchTo()" breaks that. no clean way around it. it's merely aesthetic, and nitpicky on my part.
[2013-12-12 06:52:59] barancev: how explicit wait should be implemented for switching by index?
[2013-12-12 06:53:00] jimevans: i'll get over it.

[2013-12-12 06:55:22] simonstewart: An ExpectedCondition
[2013-12-12 06:55:23] barancev: switchTo().frame(wait.until(presenseOfElementLocatedBy(...))) is quite straightforward
[2013-12-12 06:55:36] simonstewart: I'd not write that

[2013-12-12 06:56:39] simonstewart: We already have the condition
[2013-12-12 06:56:42] barancev: two hops: frame = wait.until(presenseOfElementLocated(By.xpath(...)); driver,switchTo().frame(frame)
[2013-12-12 06:56:57] simonstewart: There's two hops in your approach
[2013-12-12 06:57:55] barancev: I don't like conditions with side efffect :)
[2013-12-12 06:58:12] barancev: but yes your solution is more eco
[2013-12-12 06:58:24] simonstewart: ?
[2013-12-12 06:59:07] barancev: 1 action (switch) instead of 2 ones (find + switch), if the frame is present already

[2013-12-12 07:00:14] barancev: I prefer simplified API

[2013-12-12 07:06:09] jimevans: my personal preferences are to avoid excess casting, catching exceptions for flow control, and fluent interfaces, each of which we have in the project. but i recognize these are my personal preferences, and that not everyone shares them. so i keep my desires in these regards mostly to myself.

[2013-12-12 07:06:17] simonstewart: We only added the WebElement approach because some JS apps maintained frame references in code

[2013-12-12 07:07:51] jimevans: stoopid javascript.
[2013-12-12 07:08:34] barancev: ok, I just wanted to talk about it. I want WebDriver API to be minimalistic :)
[2013-12-12 07:08:41] simonstewart: And I quite like the fact that someone familiar with the technology we're automating could see bits of the ideas they're familiar with poking through

[2013-12-12 09:27:30] jimevans: use the TouchActions class.

[2013-12-12 09:28:24] Phasze: I do notice it's practically the same
[2013-12-12 09:28:35] jimevans: because the first thing the constructor tries to do is check for IHasTouchScreen, which no known implementation does.
[2013-12-12 09:28:37] Phasze: Click/draganddrop/etc
[2013-12-12 09:28:48] jimevans: (it's a subclass of Actions)
