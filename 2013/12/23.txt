[2013-12-23 07:26:17] barancev: wrong question
[2013-12-23 07:26:26] jimevans: more seriously, the number of users of selenium rc for python and ruby is minuscule compared to the java and .NET users of the same

[2013-12-23 07:26:37] root_empire, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-23 07:27:34] jimevans: because even three fucking years after webdriver was introduced as the way forward, people still haven't gotten the message that the rc api is not what you should be using.
[2013-12-23 07:27:59] nirvdrum, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-23 07:28:00] jimevans: and they have not migrated their legacy code to webdriver.

[2013-12-23 07:28:38] jimevans: (and selenium IDE not having a webdriver exporter for a good while didn't help either)
[2013-12-23 07:29:20] barancev: idea! let's deprecate RC exporters?
[2013-12-23 07:29:44] barancev: so they will not be able to create RC tests
[2013-12-23 07:30:10] barancev: iirc, tru RC users don't use WDBS

[2013-12-23 07:34:07] barancev: well, the *real* problem I have is a bit different: I can't run WDBS tests for .Net because the test pages are not deployed to a production selenium server now

[2013-12-23 07:58:05] jimevans: here's the thing: the list of stuff that jquery offers that plain-jane css offers is pretty small.
[2013-12-23 07:58:24] jimevans: you've got :contains, which is the big one, and a few others.

[2013-12-23 08:04:25] jimevans: parent is a one-line javascript call

[2013-12-23 09:19:38] barancev: jimevans: I need your help implementing test setup for .Net WDBS tests
[2013-12-23 09:19:49] barancev: namely, a fixture to run test server
[2013-12-23 09:20:13] barancev: like TestWebServer.cs in WebDriver.Common.Tests
[2013-12-23 09:20:58] barancev: but a bit different jar -- build/java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/v1/environment-standalone.jar
[2013-12-23 09:22:09] jimevans: barancev: you won't get that help from me today (which means you won't get it until thursday at the earliest). not trying to be rude, but i literally don't have a .NET development environment right now.
[2013-12-23 09:22:35] jimevans: i just found out that virtualbox can't support hyper-v in a guest os.

[2013-12-23 10:02:05] barancev: jimevans: I was wondered why .Net tests for WDBS are more green than Java ones, unless I found that you commented out all alert-related asserts :)
[2013-12-23 10:02:32] barancev: well, not all of them, but many ones
[2013-12-23 10:04:08] jimevans: not surprising.
[2013-12-23 10:04:27] jimevans: wdbs support is minimal
