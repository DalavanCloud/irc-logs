[2013-12-08 09:54:27] simplex_: does somebody have an idea why my function is not working anymore after i changed from firefox driver to phantomjs?
[2013-12-08 09:54:37] simplex_: i get this error: Additional information: Error Message => 'Element is not currently visible and may not be manipulated'

[2013-12-08 10:07:48] cteef: can you check if the element locator identifies more than one element?
[2013-12-08 10:08:54] smccarthy: cteef: yes
[2013-12-08 10:09:19] smccarthy: driver.findElements(By.cssSelector("cssLocator"))
[2013-12-08 10:09:28] smccarthy: that returns a list of WebElements.
[2013-12-08 10:09:30] cteef: sorry, i was asking simplex_
[2013-12-08 10:09:38] smccarthy: so u can check .size() on it
[2013-12-08 10:09:58] cteef: with respect to his problem
[2013-12-08 10:11:04] simplex_: yes it shows a lot of selectors, also, the firefox driver works perfectly, but when i changed it to the phantomjs driver, i get the error above
[2013-12-08 10:11:41] smccarthy: cteef: oh sorry k lol
[2013-12-08 10:12:16] simplex_: i also changed the window size and the elements are visible on the screenshot i took... very strange
[2013-12-08 10:14:36] cteef: simplex_: i was thinking that if your locator identified more than one element, the find_element function maybe returning the first one found which is not visible, while others were visible.
