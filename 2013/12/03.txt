[2013-12-03 06:23:06] jimevans: then the operative question is does it support the remote debugging protocol? if the answer is yes, then maybe you can use webdriver with it. if the answer is no, then no chance in hell, unless you or someone else has implementated the webdriver json wire protocol in the browser code.

[2013-12-03 07:10:56] jimevans: simplex_: not sure what you're asking. most language bindings already provide a "PhantomJSDriver" class.
[2013-12-03 07:11:41] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-03 07:12:12] jimevans: if you're trying to hide the window, use your language's facility for launching external processes to launch phantomjs.exe with the appropriate command line switches, and use that language binding's RemoteWebDriver class to connect to it.

[2013-12-03 07:24:34] jimevans: so, no, there's no explicit sample code for .NET, but it's pretty straightforward c# code. use System.Diagnostics.Process to launch phantomjs.exe with a command line argument of "--webdriver=<port number>" for whatever port you want it to listen on.
[2013-12-03 07:26:26] jimevans: then you use RemoteWebDriver, as in IWebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri("http://localhost:<port number>"), DesiredCapabilities.PhantomJS);
[2013-12-03 07:27:09] jimevans: the various arguments you use in the System.Diagnostics.Process object will allow you to entirely hide the command line window that pops up for phantomjs.
[2013-12-03 07:27:11] daleharvey: cgoldberg: you mentioned the python webdriver doesnt need to go through selenium standalone, is that true for chrome?
[2013-12-03 07:28:31] Dude-X: chrome just requires the chromedriver, no java server unless you do remote
[2013-12-03 07:29:25] ojacobson, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-03 07:30:11] simplex_: nice! thanks a lot jimevans! Can i run multiple instances of phantomjs in different threads and on different ports? Or will there be conflicts (like temporary files which are used by multiple instances etc.?
[2013-12-03 07:31:15] jimevans: simplex_: no idea. there shouldn't be any issues with the client-side webdriver code, but phantomjs might have other ideas. i assume multiple processes won't be a problem, but i won't swear to it.
[2013-12-03 07:31:38] jimevans: also, pay close attention that driver.Quit() won't shut down the phantomjs.exe process when you use this method.
[2013-12-03 07:32:06] jimevans: you're on your own managing the process lifetime
[2013-12-03 07:32:53] cgoldberg: daleharvey, yes.. but with chrome you need chromedriver executable along with it
[2013-12-03 07:34:00] simplex_: will do! Thanks a lot for your help!
[2013-12-03 07:34:01] ato: daleharvey: The chromedriver executable does its own HTTP server that speaks the JSON wire protocol.
[2013-12-03 07:34:10] jimevans: np
[2013-12-03 07:34:42] daleharvey: cool thanks
[2013-12-03 07:34:53] cgoldberg: simplex_, I've done multiple instances of phantomjs in parallel... did it with isolated processes instead of threads... a separate instance of phantomjs driver per process
[2013-12-03 07:35:19] Dave_B_: jimevans: Thanks for the MS update, didn't know you were under NDA :)
[2013-12-03 07:35:27] ato: daleharvey: If you're interested, for the new FirefoxDriver that we're working on, we'll do something similar but without HTTP for the Python client.
[2013-12-03 07:35:52] ato: So that wouldn't require the standalone Java unless you wanted to do remote either.
[2013-12-03 07:36:35] jimevans: Dave_B_: for certain things yes.
[2013-12-03 07:37:08] daleharvey: ideally I want to get to a place where I can run tests against local browsers with 0 deps and a reasonably minimal footprint, or choose to run against remote server
[2013-12-03 07:37:35] daleharvey: sounds without reinventing the world I will need chromedriver as a dep, but can live for now
[2013-12-03 07:38:03] cgoldberg: daleharvey, my only deps are "pip install selenium", and a copy of phantomjs and chromedriver binaries
[2013-12-03 07:39:19] ato: daleharvey: If you want zero dependencies you'll have to write your own libraries to speak with all the different remote debugger protocols.
[2013-12-03 07:39:40] daleharvey: Yeh that sounds about right, just need to write a js client equivalent of the code you gave me yesterday
[2013-12-03 07:40:03] cgoldberg: daleharvey, i just use a dependencies branch with seleniu, phantomjs, chromedriver checked into the branch.  so I grab a branch of my framework.. grab the dependency branch, and I'm good to write tests.. pretty simple setup

[2013-12-03 07:41:20] ato: Also I think dependencies are fine as long as they are transitive.
[2013-12-03 07:41:27] cgoldberg: daleharvey, when selenium upgrades.. and then I have a CI job that runs my framework tests with latest versions of dependencies.. so I know they all pass and I can push them to my dependency branch

[2013-12-03 08:01:04] cgoldberg: ato, you are right.. but the general concepts are similar
[2013-12-03 08:01:23] cgoldberg: ato.. sure cPython does

[2013-12-03 08:14:37] nirvdrum: Dude-X: The GIL would limit you to one core, not one CPU, as I understand it.
[2013-12-03 08:14:51] Dude-X: right one core.
[2013-12-03 08:15:18] Dude-X: i suppose you can use a C extension with python that can take advantage of multiple cores
[2013-12-03 08:15:21] Dude-X: but it's not really python
[2013-12-03 08:15:52] nirvdrum: Jython wouldn't have a GIL.  I don't think pypi does either.
[2013-12-03 08:16:06] nirvdrum: Alas, it's been years since I've actively written Python.  I miss it.
[2013-12-03 08:16:09] ato: Dude-X: That's one of the nicer features of CPython.
[2013-12-03 08:16:13] Dude-X: pypi has a GIL in the current state. Jython doesn't have a gil.
[2013-12-03 08:16:35] Dude-X: pypi however lets you use a stack less form of python
[2013-12-03 08:16:36] nirvdrum: I've been rocking JRuby for the past couple years.
[2013-12-03 08:16:38] Dude-X: err pypy
[2013-12-03 08:17:04] nirvdrum: Sorry.  Yeah, pypy.
[2013-12-03 08:17:45] Dude-X: Jython doesn't have a gil, but version 2.7.x  is still in beta
[2013-12-03 08:18:48] Dude-X: but i think pypy is better if you don't need java
[2013-12-03 08:19:22] cgoldberg: pypy rocks, but cPython meets 100 of my needs currently
[2013-12-03 08:20:12] cgoldberg: if i had a specific need, i'd use Go instead of python.. but i never find that case arises

[2013-12-03 09:37:41] therealfakemoot: lukeis: Interesting!
[2013-12-03 09:38:10] lukeis: java implicitly calls .getText() (thus causing the exception to bubble up) upon switchTo().alert()

[2013-12-03 13:07:49] jimevans: cgoldberg: yeah, but if you want that information from webdriver, that's how you're going to get it. webdriver doesn't see browser internals like "what url did my submit actually send"

[2013-12-03 13:08:43] jimevans: mib_mib: you can try the actions api, but that's blindly clicking on a point.
[2013-12-03 13:08:53] jimevans: webdriver can't see into the flash object to tell you anything about it.

[2013-12-03 13:11:37] jimevans: mib_mib: that may also depend on which browser and OS you're using. you need native events enabled for that to work.
[2013-12-03 13:12:37] mib_mib: jimevans: what are native elements?
[2013-12-03 13:12:53] mib_mib: jimevans: firefox - linux

[2013-12-03 13:14:16] mib_mib: jimevans: i think its not a matter of native vs synthetic though, because the events are still javascript, and its a security thing to let javascript manipulate flash objects
[2013-12-03 13:14:32] davidlai, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-03 13:14:35] mib_mib: jimevans: so its triggering a javascript click, but this click isnt propogating to the embedded flash object
[2013-12-03 13:14:43] jimevans: no, using native events, the events specifically *aren't* javascript.
[2013-12-03 13:14:55] jimevans: they're sent using native OS-level mechanisms
[2013-12-03 13:15:09] jimevans: and they're turned off for firefox on linux by default.
[2013-12-03 13:15:40] jimevans: so you have two choices.
[2013-12-03 13:15:51] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-03 13:15:55] jimevans: try native events, and see if that works (which it may not)
[2013-12-03 13:16:22] mib_mib: jimevans: In WebDriver advanced user interactions are provided by either simulating the Javascript events directly (i.e. synthetic events) or by letting the browser generate the Javascript events (i.e. native events)
[2013-12-03 13:16:25] jimevans: or recompile the flash object with automation hooks (which you say you don't have access to)
[2013-12-03 13:16:45] mib_mib: jimevans: inotherwords, the browser is generating a javascript event **somehow** and i think therein lies the problem
[2013-12-03 13:17:09] jimevans: mib_mib: i disagree with your characterization of what native events is doing.
[2013-12-03 13:17:11] mib_mib: jimevans: in that flash doesnt respond to any type of javascript event, its independent

[2013-12-03 13:18:14] mib_mib: jimevans: but i will try to turn them on and see what happens
[2013-12-03 13:18:22] jimevans: native events generate OS-level native events into the browser. the fact that clicking on an element using them triggers the javascript events is the desired effect, but it should also generate click events in whatever is underneath.
