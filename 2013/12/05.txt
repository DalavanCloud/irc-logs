[2013-12-05 06:49:09] llaskin: and while that value still has more then 0 elements, close the first one
[2013-12-05 06:49:13] llaskin: lather rinse repeat
[2013-12-05 06:49:15] llaskin: not the most ideal way
[2013-12-05 06:49:16] llaskin: but yea
[2013-12-05 06:51:00] therealfakemoot: As far as I've seen the only way to 'find' an alert box is to use switch_to_alert() but that doesn't seem to find the alert boxes being raised on the page
[2013-12-05 06:52:29] garndt: python right?
[2013-12-05 06:52:43] therealfakemoot: Yuip
[2013-12-05 06:53:11] therealfakemoot: switch_to_alert is returning None regardless of whether or not there's actuall an alert open in the browser at this particular moment.
[2013-12-05 06:53:12] garndt: if I remember correctly, switch_to_alert() will return an alert object, not necessarily an actual alert.  You need to interact with the alert and catch the exception if there is no alert.
[2013-12-05 06:53:35] therealfakemoot: I'm aware. I've read the source of the Alert class.
[2013-12-05 06:53:45] Dave_B_: get the text of the alert and it'll throw an exception (or not)
[2013-12-05 06:53:54] garndt: that's what I end up doing
[2013-12-05 06:53:58] llaskin: same
[2013-12-05 06:54:30] *Dave_B_ doesn't understand why nose doesn't want to play and make his tests run in parallel :('
[2013-12-05 06:55:26] therealfakemoot: That was the solution suggested the other day
[2013-12-05 06:55:55] therealfakemoot: But switch_to_alert() is returning None, even when there is an alert active.
[2013-12-05 06:56:01] Dave_B_: oh
[2013-12-05 06:56:05] therealfakemoot: I cannot get the alert object to begin with
[2013-12-05 06:57:16] cgoldberg, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-05 06:59:53] therealfakemoot: I've also played around with calling driver.execute(Command.DISMISS_ALERT) directly and catching WebDriverException but that doesn't seem to work consistently either (it'll dismiss one alert and then raise WDException even though there's nine more alert boxes open)

[2013-12-05 07:07:47] garndt: Does this happen when you first attempt to switch to an alert? I'm wondering if there is some kind of race condition when trying to interact with an alert and an alert appearing.
[2013-12-05 07:08:02] therealfakemoot: Um
[2013-12-05 07:08:23] therealfakemoot: No, I'm loading up an interactive prompt
[2013-12-05 07:08:41] therealfakemoot: I manually trigger the alert box in the browser and then try to grab the alert with switch_to_alert()
[2013-12-05 07:09:21] garndt: and then after switch_to_alert() you call something like .text on it and it throws an exception that there is no alert?
[2013-12-05 07:09:33] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-05 07:09:34] therealfakemoot: No, it throws an AttributeError
[2013-12-05 07:09:39] therealfakemoot: because NoneType has no attribute text
[2013-12-05 07:09:43] garndt: ok
[2013-12-05 07:09:57] therealfakemoot: Because switch_to_alert() is unconditionally returning None.
[2013-12-05 07:11:19] garndt: what version of selenium?
[2013-12-05 07:11:38] therealfakemoot: 2.37.2
[2013-12-05 07:11:40] therealfakemoot: according to pip
[2013-12-05 07:12:24] therealfakemoot: Latest stable.
[2013-12-05 07:12:30] therealfakemoot: according to pypi at least
[2013-12-05 07:12:39] garndt: if you are calling .text after switch_to_alert(), you should be getting a NoAlertPresentException thrown
[2013-12-05 07:12:47] garndt: if there is actually no alert
[2013-12-05 07:12:54] therealfakemoot: Yeah, I know
[2013-12-05 07:13:05] therealfakemoot: Let me read the source for switch_to_alert again.

[2013-12-05 12:20:01] barancev: UIMap? isn't it dead?
[2013-12-05 12:20:21] simonsimon: lol, perhaps, but I've got to tell you it's quite usefull :)
[2013-12-05 12:20:54] simonsimon: The IDE is very usefull for my testing.  Do you know if the UIMap and IDE will be kept or dropped?
[2013-12-05 12:21:37] barancev: not sure about UIMap but IDE is going to be dropped :)
[2013-12-05 12:21:56] simonsimon: Okay, you scared me for a second ;)
[2013-12-05 12:22:06] simonsimon: Is there something replacing the UIMap ?
[2013-12-05 12:22:33] simonsimon: Or what are people doing instead?

[2013-12-05 12:25:38] simonsimon: (I don't think so since it's java code?)

[2013-12-05 12:26:37] barancev: that was a hint -- stop using IDE, learn a programming language
[2013-12-05 12:27:41] simonsimon: Yeah, I've got a lot of webdriver code done for the app.  All of our regression testing has been done this way.  I'm used the IDE for "freelance" testing and recording my tests.  This way I can pass them to the developpers more easily.
[2013-12-05 12:28:27] simonsimon: The UIMap is quite nice because a developer can read the test and understand what I'm going...
[2013-12-05 12:28:53] simonsimon: instead of trying to understand what I clicked on with the dynamic Ids generated from the app

[2013-12-05 12:36:35] lukeis: i don't have 3 anywhere
[2013-12-05 12:36:44] barancev: simonsimon: actually I just checked UIMap should work
[2013-12-05 12:37:01] barancev: IDE recognizes ui= locator prefix
[2013-12-05 12:37:10] simonsimon: barancev: It does work.  My problem is that it doesn't work with fuzzy match.
[2013-12-05 12:37:18] Dude-X: i'll have to fix this later
[2013-12-05 12:37:21] Dude-X: but i'll submit a patch
[2013-12-05 12:37:29] Dude-X: though i wonder what happened to the code that handled httplib
[2013-12-05 12:37:48] lukeis: it was changed in favor of using KeepAlives
[2013-12-05 12:38:08] Dude-X: ah.... okay i'll have to do some research then
[2013-12-05 12:38:44] simonsimon: barancev: I've created a custom locator returning menu=x for the menus and I enable fuzzy matching.  Although the IDE returns the fuzzy match, it won't return the UI element.
[2013-12-05 12:39:06] simonsimon: ... for that fuzzy element.

[2013-12-05 12:39:57] barancev: got it. but (like many other selenium devs) don't use IDE, with UIMap or without it
[2013-12-05 12:40:28] lukeis: my IDE is IntelliJ (and Eclipse) ;)
[2013-12-05 12:40:45] Dude-X: cmcgraw: I'm afraid this might take long. i know that the python3 http.client has a lot of interesting changes so i am going to make sure that all the tests pass before I submit a patch. However it's quite likely a user will fix this before me
[2013-12-05 12:41:12] simonsimon: barancev: Yeah, I also use eclipse.  Again, my problem is that I need to be able to  record my clicks. That's why the IDE is great.
[2013-12-05 12:41:29] lukeis: cmcgraw: you could be *that* user ;)
[2013-12-05 12:41:52] barancev: simonsimon: do record and export
[2013-12-05 12:42:51] cmcgraw: awww...  <3     ;however, I'm on company time and the previous version works. :(  I'll try to get time to peek at it tonight.
[2013-12-05 12:43:10] simonsimon: barancev: Ironically enough, my plan was to write a custom export script that would work with my UIMap ! This way, IDE->Java export would work with my PageObject
[2013-12-05 12:43:20] lukeis: cmcgraw: i too am on company time ;)
[2013-12-05 12:43:40] cmcgraw: have you people contact my people to get me some OSS time :D
[2013-12-05 12:43:45] cmcgraw: your*
[2013-12-05 12:43:53] simonsimon: barancev: It's all about making the testcase very petty right in the IDE.
[2013-12-05 12:44:03] lukeis: (my company doesn't paying directly to work on OSS)

[2013-12-05 23:38:12] tbone1987: If anyone has a moment to answer I have a question. I am familiar with the older Selenium RC for use with automation, and I used to be able to run a one-liner to execute a suite and save results. With webdriver I am not sure how to get this results page. Is this possible in webdriver?
[2013-12-05 23:38:25] noahsussman, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-05 23:38:52] tbone1987: Or is the only option to use junit or some other external tool to report results?
[2013-12-05 23:42:39] smccarthy: tbone1987: junit or some other tool to report results (As far as I know)
[2013-12-05 23:43:59] tbone1987: aka is there any backend equivalent in webdriver to RC's old "java -jar seleniumRC.jar -htmlsuite /pathtoSuite.html /pathtoHTMLResults.html" (I figure they ought to have some way to do this "results.html" option)
[2013-12-05 23:44:28] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-05 23:45:25] tbone1987: thank you for the input smccarthy, may end up just junit-ing anyway. The old results page was fairly bare bones by comparison... but worth knowing if its supported still.
