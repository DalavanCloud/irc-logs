[2013-12-19 05:46:08] andy_seit: Hey Dave
[2013-12-19 05:46:36] Dave_B_: normally you could just re-do the driver.FindElement(By.blah….)
[2013-12-19 05:46:44] andy_seit: It's a numpty hack method,  it just does http://pastebin.com/KaFvyuT8
[2013-12-19 05:47:37] andy_seit: But when it re-invokes the find(..).Click, it doesn't actually re-lookup the element (at least, according to the event log), it just re-does the click [on the stale element]
[2013-12-19 05:47:42] hollickish, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-12-19 05:48:42] Dave_B_: not sure how to fix staleguard - but more generally just recalling the findelement will sort it (of course you can then get antoher stale elment) - i presume sthe action.invoke is just recalling the .click :S
[2013-12-19 05:49:50] andy_seit: Yeah, I guess I assumed the Action would represent the whole chain.  Bah.
[2013-12-19 05:50:27] Dave_B_: I'd have thought so too, apparently not! Just in case it's C# being silly - perhaps force garbage collection? I've occasionally seen odd behaviours where c# reuses things it says it won't.
[2013-12-19 05:50:51] andy_seit: Hrm.  Didn't consider GC, i'll give it a go.

[2013-12-19 08:35:33] andy_seit: Fwiw, it looks like I have a replacement for stale guard.  I just used extension methods to allow me to (for example) 'driver.Retry().Click(locator);'.  It's still awful and hacky of course, but it looks like it works.
[2013-12-19 08:36:24] Dave_B_: :) woo!
[2013-12-19 08:36:49] *Dave_B_ is worryingly happy to keep hacky stuff rather than fix it'
[2013-12-19 08:37:11] jimevans: andy_seit: so the actions class, when you use one of the methods that takes an element reference, doesn't have any way to re-find the element. it just has the element reference.
[2013-12-19 08:37:27] andy_seit: Hah :D   I'll keep it, but only because Im not smart enough to think of something more elegant.
[2013-12-19 08:37:36] jimevans: a WebElement (or IWebElement in .NET) doesn't know how it was found.
[2013-12-19 08:38:09] andy_seit: jimevans: Yeah, when you mentioned it, it seemed obvious.
[2013-12-19 08:38:50] jimevans: i'd like to *think* the .NET API wasn't just created with no thought.
[2013-12-19 08:39:53] jimevans: but the developer of it is kind of a hack, so take that for whatever it's worth.
[2013-12-19 08:40:03] jimevans: :)
[2013-12-19 08:40:14] jack090: hehe
[2013-12-19 08:41:04] andy_seit: jimevans: Nothing wrong with the API, just me not thinking things through.  Stupid un-modellable pages forced me to use raw locators and therefore expose my ignorance of wth the Action class does.
