[2013-12-13 02:22:21] ato: guest3434: I've never heard of TCL bindings for WebDriver, but any language can be used for writing WebDriver bindings.
[2013-12-13 02:22:45] guest3434: ato: any hint on how to use for TCL ?
[2013-12-13 02:23:26] guest3434: or just a generic algorithm to implement webdriver in any language...??
[2013-12-13 02:23:32] guest3434: that you can share to me ?
[2013-12-13 02:24:18] ato: WebDriver uses a JSON-over-HTTP wire protocol for commands.  So a simple TCL binding would have to implement an HTTP client that speaks that protocol to the Selenium standalone server.
[2013-12-13 02:24:27] ato: This is called using a remote driver.
[2013-12-13 02:24:44] ato: :wiki jsonwireprotocol gives a good overview of what's needed.
[2013-12-13 02:24:46] selbot2__: No results.
[2013-12-13 02:24:49] ato: Uh.

[2013-12-13 07:11:09] beefman: new to selenium, using js.  if i use driver.findElements(webdriver.By.css(myselector)), how do i log whether the thing it found has the correct properties?  appending then.(function(el){console.log(el);}); shows a driver object, not a dom element

[2013-12-13 07:21:00] jarib: beefman: i'm not sure about the JS bindings, but a WebElement is just an opaque reference to the DOM element
[2013-12-13 07:21:30] jarib: beefman: if you want more info about it, you'll need to get it through el.getText, el.getTagName, el.getAttribute etc
[2013-12-13 07:21:54] beefman: jarib: great, thanks.  are those documented anywhere?
[2013-12-13 07:22:35] jimevans: or alternatively, you might be able to do driver.executeScript("console.log(arguments[0])", el)
[2013-12-13 07:22:47] jimevans: (or whatever the equivalent is.
[2013-12-13 07:22:49] jimevans: )
[2013-12-13 07:23:18] jarib: yeah, was just about to say that - another option is to do something like driver.executeScript("return arguments[0].parentElement.innerHTML")
[2013-12-13 07:23:31] jarib: uh, that would be: driver.executeScript("return arguments[0].parentElement.innerHTML", el)

[2013-12-13 09:18:26] HerpDerp: Question, I am using python Selenium WebDriver to load URLs and then basically take a screenshot via Firefox. I also wanted to get the Local Storage Objects that are dropped by flash objects within a page. For some reason when I do geturl(...) on a page with a flash object the Flash does not load complete or no Local Storage Object is stored in .macromedia directory
[2013-12-13 09:18:37] HerpDerp: Does Selenium webdriver actually load flash objects from firefox?

[2013-12-13 12:03:19] nullx: Hello, is anyone aware how I would be able to allow phantomJS to use JQuery on the site it's evaluating? (via selenium of course)
[2013-12-13 12:03:37] lukeis: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/py/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py#L396 :)
[2013-12-13 12:04:32] nullx: lukeis: I mean if I'm under phantomjs and I go driver.executeScript("$('something').doSomething();"); it says JQuery is not present (well $ is not present)
[2013-12-13 12:05:00] lukeis: i'm not sure nullx, my link was for therealfakemoot
[2013-12-13 12:05:06] nullx: oh ok heh
[2013-12-13 12:05:11] nullx: I was actually asking about execute script ;)
[2013-12-13 12:05:14] therealfakemoot: lukeis: Okay, that makes sense.
[2013-12-13 12:05:36] therealfakemoot: lukeis: I guess.

[2013-12-13 12:09:55] lukeis: or use the sekrit private variable…. webelement._parent  :)

[2013-12-13 12:11:29] therealfakemoot: Not proud of it but working with CKEditor is really hard
[2013-12-13 12:11:30] therealfakemoot: I'm not sure
[2013-12-13 12:11:58] therealfakemoot: I changed it do `{'script':script, 'args':None}` and still get 'h is undefined'
[2013-12-13 12:11:59] *lukeis doesn't do SO too much'
[2013-12-13 12:12:04] therealfakemoot: No, I hate SO
[2013-12-13 12:12:18] therealfakemoot: but it had this prerolled solution that SEEMED to implement the solution theCKEditor docs prescribed
[2013-12-13 12:12:34] lukeis: it might need an empty list then… like 'args':[]
[2013-12-13 12:12:35] jimevans: barancev: sorry. had stepped away for a bit. i don't think it's the right approach.
[2013-12-13 12:13:02] therealfakemoot: let's try it

[2013-12-13 12:20:23] therealfakemoot: As in, I'm passing a whole javascript snippet in.
[2013-12-13 12:20:31] therealfakemoot: What else is there to pass to execute()?

[2013-12-13 12:20:38] DrJenkins, quitting. (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[2013-12-13 12:20:42] jimevans: therealfakemoot: they're the argument to the javascript. if your script requires no arguments, pass None.
[2013-12-13 12:21:10] therealfakemoot: Passing None still produces "h is undefined"
[2013-12-13 12:21:45] lukeis: therealfakemoot: you can do something like  driver.execute("arguments[0].value = arguments[1]", webelement, 'Something')
[2013-12-13 12:21:58] lukeis: webelement and 'Something' are the 'args'
[2013-12-13 12:22:00] therealfakemoot: Ah, I see.
[2013-12-13 12:22:11] therealfakemoot: That's kinda neat actually
[2013-12-13 12:22:20] therealfakemoot: parameterized javascript or something
[2013-12-13 12:22:29] lukeis: and really, you want to use the driver.execute_script way  (so use webelement._parent)
[2013-12-13 12:22:33] therealfakemoot: Yeah.
[2013-12-13 12:22:39] therealfakemoot: I'll work on changing that now.
[2013-12-13 12:23:04] jimevans: it makes perfect sense when you realize that execute_script wraps your script fragment into an anonymous function for execution, which can, of course, have arguments. :)
[2013-12-13 12:24:17] lukeis: it's a bit of needing to know what happens under the hood though ;)
[2013-12-13 12:24:38] therealfakemoot: Yes.
[2013-12-13 12:24:43] therealfakemoot: That's really important, and really hard to do
[2013-12-13 12:24:50] therealfakemoot: because I've got the compiled/minified javascript
[2013-12-13 12:24:55] therealfakemoot: and all the names are completely meaningless

[2013-12-13 12:25:20] lukeis: well, don't try to call the JSON wire directly… that's just silly :)
[2013-12-13 12:25:28] therealfakemoot: I wasn't aware that I was.
[2013-12-13 12:25:29] lukeis: unless you *really* know what you're doing

[2013-12-13 12:26:10] jimevans: in python, anytime you're resorting to calling ._execute(), that's dropping down to the wire protocol.
[2013-12-13 12:26:17] therealfakemoot: I see.
[2013-12-13 12:26:33] lukeis: the "_" should be a red flag btw
[2013-12-13 12:26:38] lukeis: it's a private method :)

[2013-12-13 13:03:52] dimacus: xsanders:  just ask it you will get a faster answer, then if you ask for permission to ask a question first ;)
[2013-12-13 13:03:56] jimevans: xsanders: :ask
[2013-12-13 13:03:57] selbot2__: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[2013-12-13 13:04:49] xsanders: thanx ;) ok, basic question: does element.click() fire an onmousedown javascript event if it is attached to a link ?
[2013-12-13 13:05:01] nullx: it should
[2013-12-13 13:05:09] dimacus: are you using RC or Webdriver?
[2013-12-13 13:06:18] xsanders: eh, good question. i installed selenium via pip install selenium
[2013-12-13 13:06:25] xsanders: using the chromedriver
[2013-12-13 13:06:41] jimevans: if you're using chromedriver, that's webdriver.
