[2013-12-09 03:29:13] sgronblo1: Hey, can someone help me figure out how to select an option from a dropdown using the JS webdriver?
[2013-12-09 03:31:06] sgronblo1: For Java it seems you can wrap the result of findElement in a Select object and then call selectByVisibleText
[2013-12-09 03:31:21] sgronblo1: But I can't find any mention of this on the JS documentation site
[2013-12-09 03:31:36] ato: That's a utility class probably not implemented in JS.
[2013-12-09 03:31:48] ato: It calls down to the webdriver APIs internally.
[2013-12-09 03:32:07] sgronblo1: Can I work around it somehow?
[2013-12-09 03:32:52] ato: driver.findElement(By.id("my-option")).click()
[2013-12-09 03:33:39] sgronblo1: Ah I can just find by id and click? I will try it.
[2013-12-09 03:33:41] ato: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/Select.java
[2013-12-09 03:34:33] ato: sgronblo1: You probably want to do a el.isSelected() check first.
[2013-12-09 03:34:58] ato: If you end up writing a Select utility like that in JS, feel free to contribute it back to the project (-:
[2013-12-09 03:35:09] ato: I imagine it would be useful to have something similar in JS.
[2013-12-09 03:35:58] sgronblo1: ato: I'm still quite new to using the API

[2013-12-09 04:10:03] Ardesco: I have a basic implementation, but I haven't made it cater for promises yet

[2013-12-09 04:11:23] Ardesco: I've not really used the JS binding for writing tests much yet, just done a basic Protractor implementation
[2013-12-09 04:11:29] sgronblo1: Yeah, but I suppose you use webdriver for testing in some actual project?
[2013-12-09 04:11:41] Ardesco: I've not yet attempted to setup data for tests in JS

I have two main problems, IEDriver is not closed properly sometimes which fails the test when Jenkins is trying to clean the target directory since IEDriver is in use, and the fact that no matter how much I try to start a clean IE Session, cookies sometimes is present anyway.
[2013-12-09 05:44:49] DrJenkins: My thinking is to simply kill the IEDriver process and clean out cookies straight from Java before each IE test, but I just want to know if more people than me use this route to get IE tests to become stable.

[2013-12-09 06:51:11] ato: Yes.

[2013-12-09 06:51:30] barancev: simonstewart: why InvalidSelectorException extends NoSuchElementException ? this causes issues with explicit waits
[2013-12-09 06:51:30] simonstewart: The build tool will build you the AUTHORS file

[2013-12-09 06:52:13] barancev: we should not ignore InvalidSelectorException, there is no chance to succeed
[2013-12-09 06:52:25] simonstewart: context?
[2013-12-09 06:52:34] simonstewart: Imagine that you've just started talking to me out of the blue
[2013-12-09 06:52:39] simonstewart: And I'm at my day job
[2013-12-09 06:52:42] ato: What is a build tool (I'm thinking of make as the canonical example) if not for taking some input and doing some processing to generate new files?
[2013-12-09 06:52:59] barancev: simonstewart: new WebDriverWait().until(presenseOfElementLocated(by))
[2013-12-09 06:53:16] simonstewart: ok
[2013-12-09 06:53:39] simonstewart: If the user entered an invalid selector, they should catch that as they write their tests
[2013-12-09 06:53:43] simonstewart: I have no sympathy
[2013-12-09 06:53:49] ato: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-docs/blob/master/Makefile#L38 is a good example of what I'm trying to do here.

[2013-12-09 07:15:43] ato: is_null: To answer the first bit of your question, you'd wrap your search for the element in a try block and catch the exception to determine if it's present or not.

[2013-12-09 07:25:14] jimevans: is_null: i should hope so, but imnsho, the use of implicit/explicit waits should be completely abstracted away from your test code (and under the hood, shouldn't use implicit waits)

[2013-12-09 07:27:10] is_null: as you can see, there is not much difference, because my routines are good and the wait is almost transparent
[2013-12-09 07:27:34] is_null: however, the time and energy spent coding waits is better spent on other things, me thinks
[2013-12-09 07:28:12] jimevans: is_null: which is why you use a helper method. code it properly once, and you're done.
[2013-12-09 07:28:23] jimevans: but what do i know
[2013-12-09 07:29:22] jimevans: i guess i'm just a stickler for wanting my test code to accurately express exactly what i'm trying to do, and if i need to wait for something, i want to *know* i have to wait for it.
[2013-12-09 07:29:31] jimevans: at a glance.
[2013-12-09 07:30:10] dimacus: anyone ever played with JavascriptExecutor for java?
[2013-12-09 07:30:15] Ardesco: the time and effort spent putting explicit waits in will aid debugging and make your tests run faster in my experience
[2013-12-09 07:30:19] is_null: i don't understand why selenium can't just wait until all events are done triggering, all the wait fuss seems hacking
[2013-12-09 07:30:21] dimacus: is that seporate from executeScript?
[2013-12-09 07:30:45] ato: jimevans: That's a fair point.  If I needed to do anything serious with Selenium I would maybe be inclined to do just that.
[2013-12-09 07:30:50] is_null: imho the problem lies in selenium at a lower level

[2013-12-09 07:32:19] is_null: jimevans: can't the driver just wait for the js triggers to be all completed before returning to execution ?

[2013-12-09 07:35:15] is_null: wouldn't you ?
[2013-12-09 07:35:37] jimevans: is_null: so you're drawing an arbitrary line, then.
[2013-12-09 07:36:02] is_null: i see, thanks for answering
[2013-12-09 07:37:38] jimevans: is_null: hey, i'm not opposed to making the drivers more synchronous, i just don't think the problem is that simple.
[2013-12-09 07:38:30] jimevans: and that comes from a lot of time tinkering with the inner workings of multiple browsers.
[2013-12-09 07:38:39] jimevans: if you want to tackle the problem, go for it.
[2013-12-09 07:38:49] jimevans: it's beyond me as a developer.
[2013-12-09 07:38:49] AutomatedTester: is_null: FWIW, future browsers are going to pushing more and more things into the asynch space so its going to get harder to solve

[2013-12-09 07:48:03] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Unless I'm mistaken, that's not really the halting problem.  If you have a known set of event handlers, then you should know whether they've completed.  It's just that if you accept that as your definition of "done" you have to accept that the underlying set can grow ad infinitum.
[2013-12-09 07:49:28] simonstewart: nirvdrum: you don't actually know whether the OS has yet processed the event
[2013-12-09 07:49:51] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Event handlers don't have a processed state?
[2013-12-09 07:50:17] Ardesco, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-12-09 07:50:20] simonstewart: On Windows we know that we've hit the message handler of the browser
[2013-12-09 07:50:21] nirvdrum: I mean, if they don't, that's a solvable problem.  It's effectively what promises and futures do.
[2013-12-09 07:50:31] simonstewart: But we don't know whether the message has been processed yet
[2013-12-09 07:50:54] nirvdrum: Gotcha.
[2013-12-09 07:51:03] Ardesco: good lord, somebody is asking if Selenium can telnet/ssh into a server on the mailing list

[2013-12-09 07:51:18] simonstewart: Well, bless ;em
[2013-12-09 07:51:24] nirvdrum: I was under the impression the request was for JS handlers.
[2013-12-09 07:51:35] ato: I think we should add an API for telnetting.
[2013-12-09 07:52:22] Ardesco: before or after the JDBC API?

[2013-12-09 07:54:48] nirvdrum: simonstewart: There always seems to be two levels to this discussion :-)
[2013-12-09 07:55:30] simonstewart: Well, there's "async isn't impossible to handle sanely" and then there's "the horror that is the modern browser"
[2013-12-09 07:58:06] nirvdrum: I meant more the "why can't you just do X?" and then the real implementation level.
[2013-12-09 07:59:28] jimevans: speaking mainly for the IE case, if you're going to use native events, you can't unambiguously wait for a page to load after a click, not without a forced, hard-coded sleep. you can detect the navigation occurring, but a click may not cause a navigation.
[2013-12-09 08:00:00] jimevans: (i mention this mainly for those in the channel who aren't familiar with browser driver internals)
[2013-12-09 08:00:39] nirvdrum: jimevans: I guess I'm suggesting a better answer might be "the browser just doesn't let us through the interfaces they provide" rather than "it's impossible to solve", give the browser itself is evidently able to solve it.
[2013-12-09 08:01:08] nirvdrum: *given
[2013-12-09 08:01:29] jimevans: that's a fair answer.
[2013-12-09 08:02:42] jimevans: i'll also mention that the question is often asked without realizing that it needs to be solved in every. single. browser. the project supports.
[2013-12-09 08:02:51] nirvdrum: It doesn't require a theoretical understanding, counters the immediate counter-claim, and lets us shift blame to another party :-D
[2013-12-09 08:03:14] nirvdrum: jimevans: Also fair.

[2013-12-09 08:50:43] dogarrhea: what is a good (low maintenance) setup for selenium in parallel
[2013-12-09 08:51:22] dogarrhea: I imagine it's more subtle than just "install virtual box / set up vms / run tests"
[2013-12-09 08:51:31] dogarrhea: there might be some concurrency issues
[2013-12-09 08:52:00] lukeis: simonstewart: be careful with the android java removal… selendroid uses some of the classes from the selenium project (cause you know, java). I'll have to double check what selendroid is consuming
[2013-12-09 08:52:15] simonstewart: Jesus
[2013-12-09 08:52:17] simonstewart: Right
[2013-12-09 08:52:27] simonstewart: Well, I appear to be mucking around with selendroid now
[2013-12-09 08:52:49] simonstewart: I'll just check in the new binary and see what breaks
[2013-12-09 08:52:54] simonstewart: Oh fuck you maven
[2013-12-09 08:52:58] simonstewart: fuck you very much
[2013-12-09 08:52:59] lukeis: teehee
[2013-12-09 08:53:03] dogarrhea: phone automation is the trashcan
[2013-12-09 08:53:06] lukeis: you can locally maven install ;)
[2013-12-09 08:53:18] dogarrhea: android 2.3.3 is worse than ie6 ever was
[2013-12-09 08:53:22] simonstewart: Right.
[2013-12-09 08:53:23] lukeis: or i can, since I know what i'm doing with maven :-D
[2013-12-09 08:53:24] dogarrhea: worse than winderp 98
[2013-12-09 08:53:34] simonstewart: Let's see if we can find out where the android driver is referenced
[2013-12-09 08:53:53] lukeis: all the TouchActions implementations for sure
[2013-12-09 08:53:56] simonstewart: find . -name "pom.xml"
[2013-12-09 08:54:03] lukeis: ha
[2013-12-09 08:54:04] simonstewart: TouchActions wasn't in the android tree
[2013-12-09 08:54:07] simonstewart: it's in remote
[2013-12-09 08:54:07] lukeis: ok
[2013-12-09 08:54:15] ato: dogarrhea: Not exactly sure what you're asking for.
[2013-12-09 08:54:20] lukeis: then likely none directly from the android tree
[2013-12-09 08:54:21] ato: dogarrhea: A simple one-machine setup would be to wrap your browsers in xvfb-run and writing a parallelization runner for JUnit.
[2013-12-09 08:54:46] ato: Personally I wouldn't bother with virtualization of each browser unless you know you need it.
[2013-12-09 08:55:30] dogarrhea: ato. there are OS specific browser quirks
[2013-12-09 08:55:44] dogarrhea: ie8 on various windows versions runs differently
[2013-12-09 08:55:49] dogarrhea: safari on windows etc
[2013-12-09 08:56:24] ato: That's a pretty big condition.
[2013-12-09 08:56:32] ato: There's nothing simple about any of that.
[2013-12-09 08:57:05] dogarrhea: firefox's X window system screws things up on linux too
[2013-12-09 08:57:18] dogarrhea: sometimes you can't even maximize the window
[2013-12-09 08:57:48] lukeis: jimevans: o/
[2013-12-09 08:57:57] jimevans: \o
[2013-12-09 08:59:14] ato: That's not Firefox specific behaviour, I think.
[2013-12-09 08:59:43] ato: A browser instance running in a X framebuffer doesn't have a window manager, which could cause window manipulation issues.
[2013-12-09 08:59:58] dogarrhea: ato, the way the window resizes and how it affects content inside the window is very browser specific
[2013-12-09 09:00:04] dogarrhea: and is definitely tied to the OS too
[2013-12-09 09:00:10] simonstewart: lukeis: what the fuck is this shit?

[2013-12-09 09:03:10] lukeis: Dude-X: yes… although I wanted them to run the tests to check for more failures with py3 and they did and there was 2 more, but I don't have more details
[2013-12-09 09:03:27] Dude-X: fair enough
[2013-12-09 09:03:30] dogarrhea: where the clinican says "This is how we do stuff. First we drag the window bar to the very top on Windows 7 so it half resizes the window. then whe open another and do the same thing but on the right so we can see two things at once blah blah blah blah"
[2013-12-09 09:03:36] dogarrhea: so we test this situation

[2013-12-09 09:05:48] simonstewart: lukeis: if I use "mvn versions:set" to the version of the official release and then do a "mvn install" will it replace the copy in my .m2/repository?
[2013-12-09 09:05:53] lukeis: so funny to me… maven seems like cake walk compared to every 'ant' solution I've come across

[2013-12-09 09:06:09] lukeis: :)
[2013-12-09 09:06:22] lukeis: you can install 2.0-SNAPSHOT locally and point selendroid to that version
[2013-12-09 09:06:22] Dude-X: looks like a few more python3 errors

[2013-12-09 09:06:33] simonstewart: how?
[2013-12-09 09:06:54] dogarrhea: we are currently looking at sauce labs for contracting this parallelization out so we can just work on writing the tests, but it's my job to investigate if it's worth the effort
[2013-12-09 09:07:19] dogarrhea: i'm attempting to find out all the nuances for doing this ourselves vs the minute plan at saucelabs.
[2013-12-09 09:07:27] lukeis: simonstewart: after you've done mvn install (you have 2.0-SNAPSHOT in your .m2/repo), then just update the pom.xml (s) in selendroid to use that version instead of (2.37?) that it is now
[2013-12-09 09:07:46] simonstewart: I can't really see how this is simpler

[2013-12-09 09:16:46] simonstewart: dogarrhea: I use data to slim down the combination

[2013-12-09 10:17:40] jleyba: easier to scale up safari on windows if you use virtualization
[2013-12-09 10:17:52] jack090_: true
[2013-12-09 10:18:08] jack090_: or just find the how-to-guide for esxi and mac os
[2013-12-09 10:18:16] jack090_: works pretty good
[2013-12-09 10:18:30] jleyba: although, IMO testing desktop safari doesn't buy you much if you're already testing chrome
[2013-12-09 10:18:37] jleyba: might change down the line as webkit and blink diverge

[2013-12-09 10:20:02] jimevans: so for IE, the driver does, in fact, work by shoving windows mouse and keyboard messages into the event queue of IE. note that it explicitly *doesn't* just call the javascript element.click() unless you specifically tell it to via a capability.
[2013-12-09 10:20:23] jleyba: jimevans: if synthetic events use the atoms, then element.click() never gets called
[2013-12-09 10:20:44] jimevans: and that's one reason it's occasionally unreliable, and why window focus is important for IE.
[2013-12-09 10:20:59] jleyba: i meant the atoms don't just do element.click()
[2013-12-09 10:21:12] jleyba: they generate the full mousedown, mouseup, click sequence
[2013-12-09 10:21:26] jimevans: jleyba: i'm aware of that. i'm glossing over for simplicity's sake.
[2013-12-09 10:22:03] jimevans: i've made my eyes bleed too many times tracing through the atoms' click code to *not* know that. :)

[2013-12-09 10:22:43] dogarrhea: oh. so it sounds like it does matter if you're running multiple versions of a browser on windows
[2013-12-09 10:22:58] dogarrhea: running parallel tests on the same machine soudns like it does not work
[2013-12-09 10:23:05] jimevans: (and to be fair, i'm oversimplifying native events too; there are a [very small, limited] number cases where we fall back to javascript even *if* you're using native events)
[2013-12-09 10:23:06] jleyba: no, it should
[2013-12-09 10:23:19] dogarrhea: and this seems to be correct. usually the user won't be running safari and ie 8 6 and 7 all on the same machine
[2013-12-09 10:23:26] dogarrhea: this is not really "simulating the user"
[2013-12-09 10:23:32] jack090_: I've found IE is so squirrelly that I just run 1 instance at a time per machine
[2013-12-09 10:23:36] jack090_: and 1 version installed
[2013-12-09 10:23:39] jleyba: assuming you have the hardware to support it, you should be able to run tests against multiple browsers in parallel
[2013-12-09 10:23:54] dogarrhea: on same OS session?
[2013-12-09 10:24:02] dogarrhea: or are you talking about soemthing else
[2013-12-09 10:24:06] jleyba: yes
[2013-12-09 10:24:18] dogarrhea: <jimevans> and that's one reason it's occasionally unreliable, and why window focus is important for IE
[2013-12-09 10:24:24] jleyba: I wouldn't recommend it, but it is possible
[2013-12-09 10:24:25] dogarrhea: this sounds like you can't do that
[2013-12-09 10:24:31] jack090_: I've found weirdness with cookies when I run multi-sessions with IE
[2013-12-09 10:24:46] jleyba: Oh I would never do concurrent sessions for IE or Safari
[2013-12-09 10:24:51] jack090_: if time isn't a factor I'd suggest running them 1 at a time per machine
[2013-12-09 10:24:52] jleyba: those browsers depend on global state

[2013-12-09 13:08:25] AutomatedTester: dogarrhea: what do you mean
[2013-12-09 13:08:40] dogarrhea: so if two tests are running simultaneously and you delete/create content simultaneously,
[2013-12-09 13:08:45] dogarrhea: i can see some problems in testing
[2013-12-09 13:08:59] Dude-X: use locks, or different users, or schedule your tests to avoid conflicts
[2013-12-09 13:09:18] jimevans: dogarrhea: i always isolate my test data so that doesn't happen. different user accounts or profiles are key.
[2013-12-09 13:09:20] AutomatedTester: dogarrhea: use different users. Each test should be able to run in parallel and not influence other tests
[2013-12-09 13:09:30] dogarrhea: "schedule tests to avoid conflicts" seems like not the point of parallelization
[2013-12-09 13:09:37] dogarrhea: what if there's shared content?
[2013-12-09 13:09:51] dogarrhea: ie, two users can access the same content
[2013-12-09 13:10:14] AutomatedTester: in that case you optimise for testing content versus testing for functionality
[2013-12-09 13:10:23] jimevans: but i also make sure i always have provisioning hooks in the application so i don't have to go through the UI to create those users.

[2013-12-09 13:15:55] AutomatedTester: but if not, then it might be easier to manually test it
[2013-12-09 13:16:21] jack090: so you're wanting to test something that would or would not happen in real life?
[2013-12-09 13:16:24] AutomatedTester: you can sync by doing flow with user 1, logging out and then logging in with user 2 and checking you can see the data
[2013-12-09 13:16:48] dogarrhea: jack090 i'm definitely wanting to test simultaneous users
[2013-12-09 13:16:54] dogarrhea: but selenium doesn't seem useful for testing data.
[2013-12-09 13:16:57] nicegraham: I had to automate a poker application in a previous life - so I controlled 2 "users" in the same testcase

[2013-12-09 13:19:03] dogarrhea: groovy
[2013-12-09 13:19:55] jack090: In C# I would do something like a multi-threaded instance and use built in loops to wait for actions
[2013-12-09 13:20:18] lukeis: dogarrhea: I like your thinking… new RemoteIndianWorker("http://india.consultant.com", { "speaksEnglish": true})   ;)
[2013-12-09 13:20:34] nicegraham: heh
[2013-12-09 13:20:43] jack090: I put more leverage on the language such as C#/ Java  then selenium itself
[2013-12-09 13:22:15] jack090: so you can basically spawn up two instanced of remote webdriver
[2013-12-09 13:22:17] jack090: instances
[2013-12-09 13:22:40] dogarrhea: i have that already
[2013-12-09 13:22:41] jack090: and have one execute a testcase and the other is the "response" testcase
[2013-12-09 13:22:47] dogarrhea: oh
[2013-12-09 13:22:55] jack090: it's really 2 testcases
[2013-12-09 13:23:21] jack090: and have them put into a wait for response type method
[2013-12-09 13:24:02] dogarrhea: this seems really like load testing domain
[2013-12-09 13:24:07] jack090: such as: while (IsTextPresent(Value) == false && TO < TimeoutSeconds) { SleepMilliseconds(1000); TO++;}
[2013-12-09 13:24:27] dogarrhea: jack090 that test is inherently flakey
[2013-12-09 13:24:42] dogarrhea: we don't know if there's a javascript error, the server is slow, a user is locking one resource or anything else
[2013-12-09 13:24:55] dogarrhea: we just know the text isn't present for some reason
[2013-12-09 13:25:08] dogarrhea: if we are running simultaneous stuff
[2013-12-09 13:25:26] dogarrhea: this simultaneouity is making things much harder.  Looks like it's time to install jmeter
[2013-12-09 13:25:34] jack090: you could essentially setup a "listener" to wait until the expected "bug" appears
[2013-12-09 13:25:44] jack090: and manually do it
[2013-12-09 13:26:14] jack090: do it manually = meaning that you could track down how it is occuring
[2013-12-09 13:27:07] jack090: best way to debug these scenario's is just to add a lot more logging into your application
[2013-12-09 13:27:33] dogarrhea: our dev ops people are pushign back on that lol
[2013-12-09 13:27:46] dogarrhea: "LESS LOGGING. ITS GETTING TOO HARD TO READ STUFF WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM"
[2013-12-09 13:27:47] jack090: once you identify the issue you can then begin to try and automate it
[2013-12-09 13:27:59] jack090: well you can put it in a "debug" mode
[2013-12-09 13:28:04] jack090: and toggle it off an on
[2013-12-09 13:28:37] dogarrhea: doesn't really matter if the devs use an inappropriate logging level
[2013-12-09 13:28:48] dogarrhea: "oh the dev ops guy turned the logging down. let's use error for everything now"
[2013-12-09 13:30:03] jack090: I'd say creating two cases is your best bet then
[2013-12-09 13:30:08] jack090: or tell the dev ops to shove it :-)
[2013-12-09 13:30:34] dogarrhea: ok ok. so basically if i want to simulate two users doing the same thing, first, selenium isn't the tool for that, probably some load tester
[2013-12-09 13:30:57] dogarrhea: and maintain two separate data stores for simultaneous tests on ie and firefox and whatever else, which is the intended original scope of selenium
[2013-12-09 13:31:39] jack090: by data stores you mean test cases?
[2013-12-09 13:31:52] dogarrhea: data that the tests will modify
[2013-12-09 13:31:58] jack090: correct
[2013-12-09 13:32:06] dogarrhea: database. warehouse whatever
[2013-12-09 13:32:08] jimevans: dogarrhea: sounds like you're on the right track, except that you don't need separate data stores if individual users' data can be isolated within a given data store (e.g., back-end database)

[2013-12-09 13:34:11] jimevans: okay, is there any data that can be isolated according to entity? (maybe "user" is the wrong encapsulating entity; maybe it's "organization" or "office location" or something else) if not, then yeah, maybe you really do need separate data stores.
[2013-12-09 13:35:03] jimevans: my point is to only set up as much heavyweight stuff for the app as you absolutely have to.
[2013-12-09 13:35:20] jimevans: and a separate data store sounds heavyweight to me, though i don't know the app in question.
[2013-12-09 13:35:31] dogarrhea: ok. i have a plan of attack.  1st, create 1 vm 1 database for each browser and Operating system permutation I want to test
[2013-12-09 13:35:37] jimevans: and, then again, i'm an idiot, so don't take my word for it.
[2013-12-09 13:35:50] dogarrhea: as far as testing data itself, there's performance testing for that
[2013-12-09 13:35:59] dogarrhea: Jmeter, sql profilers etc .
[2013-12-09 13:36:16] dogarrhea: and I will hav eto flesh out the locking mechanism on the user front end for the devs to figure out.
[2013-12-09 13:36:27] dogarrhea: what error messages etc.
[2013-12-09 13:36:37] jack090_: Yup.
[2013-12-09 13:36:45] dogarrhea: that will be another bit of complexity to deal with.

[2013-12-09 13:36:46] jack090_: you have to reproduce the error somehow
[2013-12-09 13:36:54] dogarrhea: how do parallel tests talk to each other
[2013-12-09 13:37:05] dogarrhea: there's now global application scope among instances
[2013-12-09 13:37:25] dogarrhea: can the hub see what's going on in all the tests its running?
[2013-12-09 13:37:38] jack090_: Don't think so
[2013-12-09 13:37:49] jack090_: you'd have to develop that logic yourself
[2013-12-09 13:37:52] dogarrhea: bleh.
[2013-12-09 13:37:54] dogarrhea: hard problems.
[2013-12-09 13:38:22] AutomatedTester: let's go shopping
[2013-12-09 13:38:28] jack090_: That's why I was saying you'd probably have to do that in a language such as C#/Java
[2013-12-09 13:39:01] dogarrhea: might be easier to manual test this with 2 peopel sitting side by side
[2013-12-09 13:39:11] jack090_: :-)
[2013-12-09 13:39:12] dogarrhea: looking at the two screens
[2013-12-09 13:39:24] lukeis: Hiya AutomatedTester, sorry about the many point releases… i really aught to install py3 somewhere (but i have failed to do so properly a few times ;) )
[2013-12-09 13:39:40] AutomatedTester: lukeis: its all good
[2013-12-09 13:39:41] jimevans: most of the "shared data" issues i encounter can be handled by "log out as user 1, log in as user 2," unless you really, *really* need real-time collaboration.
[2013-12-09 13:39:49] AutomatedTester: lukeis: thanks for sorting it though
[2013-12-09 13:40:04] dogarrhea: jimevans, think sharing a google doc
[2013-12-09 13:40:05] lukeis: Pull Requests ftw! :)
[2013-12-09 13:41:16] jimevans: dogarrhea: yeah, i get the use case, but it seems to me that the "real-time collaboration" of that is a comparatively small portion of the "shared data" tests.
[2013-12-09 13:41:57] jack090_: You can do simultaneous and real-time collaboration
[2013-12-09 13:42:02] jack090_: but it would take a loooong time to setup
[2013-12-09 13:42:49] dogarrhea: what if i created a new suite called "seleniumSimultaneousTests"
[2013-12-09 13:42:59] nicegraham: that would fix it
[2013-12-09 13:43:01] dogarrhea: where I have two web drivers
[2013-12-09 13:43:39] dogarrhea: well, this would involve a rewrite of all of the current tests
[2013-12-09 13:43:58] dogarrhea: which are running on a single instance of firefox
[2013-12-09 13:45:02] dogarrhea: argh. still the problem of one thread needing info from the other thread. and writing these kinds of tests is crazy hard
[2013-12-09 13:45:02] phasze: alright lukeis, ready to help me with ios-server? ;)
[2013-12-09 13:45:24] lukeis: there's guys in #ios-driver that can help ;)
[2013-12-09 13:45:31] *lukeis is one of them in there too'
[2013-12-09 13:45:31] phasze: blast!

[2013-12-09 14:52:59] jack090_: hardly anyone uses ie64 (customer wise)
[2013-12-09 14:53:12] jack090_: when you run IE typically you run the 32bit
[2013-12-09 14:53:16] jack090_: version
[2013-12-09 14:53:34] dogarrhea: so it doesn't work on ie 64?

[2013-12-09 14:56:37] jack090_: -Dwebdriver.ie.driver=C:\SomePath\IEDriverServer.exe i bet is what you are missing for using IEdriver
[2013-12-09 14:57:44] dogarrhea: i'm thinking the whole browserName=Internet Explorer is the root cause
[2013-12-09 14:58:04] dogarrhea: when i do -browser browserName = internet explorer
[2013-12-09 14:58:11] dogarrhea: it sets it as internet
[2013-12-09 14:58:15] lukeis: it's supposed to be lower cased

[2013-12-09 15:07:14] jack090_: dogarrhea it probably has to do with not finding internet explorer
[2013-12-09 15:07:29] dogarrhea: it runs when I do not use a hub and use the iedriver server directly
[2013-12-09 15:07:36] jack090_: can you go to command prompt and type iexplore

[2013-12-09 15:08:46] jack090_: and type iexplore

[2013-12-09 15:11:28] jack090_: I'd use the x86 version

[2013-12-09 15:51:09] dogarrhea: it starts to run the test.  This seems like a big bug in desiredCapabilities

[2013-12-09 15:51:23] tviru1987: If anyone has a moment to help a noob question I'd appreciate it. I am trying to move a Selenium IDE test case over to Java/Junit and run it in eclipse, but I am having problems and I believe it is something in the setup I am missing. When I run the case, it seem to not understand what FirefoxDriver() is and gives "NoClassDefFoundError" at the firefoxDriver line.

[2013-12-09 15:52:37] AutomatedTester: tviru1987: have you done the classpaths?
[2013-12-09 15:53:31] tviru1987: Most likely I have not but not sure. I have downloaded and installed maven, and run the maven setup on a pom.xml file as described  in Selenium docs.
[2013-12-09 15:53:44] tviru1987: @AutomatedTester (see above)
[2013-12-09 15:54:20] AutomatedTester: tviru1987: I defer to lukeis then, if he has time before he heads home
[2013-12-09 15:55:36] lukeis: (not especially) if it's in maven, your java file needs to be in a folder: src/main/java  (or more appropriately src/test/java) relative to the pom.xml
[2013-12-09 15:55:37] tviru1987: @lukeis, if you aren't heading home yet,well, that would be cool for me. :)
[2013-12-09 15:56:02] lukeis: i have a few moments left ;) (very few)
[2013-12-09 15:56:45] tviru1987: is there a simpler way to get my java case up and running without maven then? It seems that this is an unnecessarily convoluted way to get one single java file running.
[2013-12-09 15:57:19] lukeis: heh, you can download the standalone jar and add it to your classpath
[2013-12-09 15:57:24] tviru1987: I have seen things to the effect of downloading and pointing manually to a "FirefoxDriver" of some kind.
[2013-12-09 15:57:34] tviru1987: but not sure if that's correct or even true!
[2013-12-09 15:57:44] lukeis: 'simple' setup is a relative term in java… simpler would be python ;)
[2013-12-09 15:58:34] lukeis: unless you know java, "just" running a single file is not straight forward as any newb would hope
[2013-12-09 15:58:46] lukeis: :yt my drunken selenium

[2013-12-09 15:58:56] lukeis: tutorial on getting up and going with IntelliJ :)
[2013-12-09 15:59:43] tviru1987: Would you recommend IntelliJ over Eclipse? I have never used IntelliJ
[2013-12-09 15:59:50] lukeis: yes
