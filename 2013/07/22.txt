[2013-07-22 05:55:10] simonstewart: ?
[2013-07-22 05:55:31] axellj: hola! I'm looking to set up Selenium Server to control remote tests using Jenkins. I've got a few questions about the requirements on the server running the serenium hub / nodes though:
[2013-07-22 05:55:56] axellj: * Can I run without setting up an explicit always-logged-in user session on the remote server?
[2013-07-22 05:56:13] axellj: * Is it feasible / sensible to run selenium as a service ?
[2013-07-22 05:56:25] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: there is a contributer who watches all areas of the code base for fun and is stupidly clever
[2013-07-22 05:56:27] axellj: (This is in a windows environment)
[2013-07-22 05:56:33] adamgoucher: axellj: no.
[2013-07-22 05:56:39] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: he also writes the DOM spec for fun while at uni
[2013-07-22 05:56:47] simonstewart: ah
[2013-07-22 05:56:49] axellj: adamgoucher: to both questions?
[2013-07-22 05:56:55] simonstewart: msg2r?
[2013-07-22 05:56:56] adamgoucher: axellj: yes
[2013-07-22 05:57:05] AutomatedTester: ms2ger, yup
[2013-07-22 05:58:02] axellj: hm. the ops dudes are not feeling happy about having a persistent always-logged-on user. Anyone have  any idea how I might engange them about this?
[2013-07-22 05:58:40] adamgoucher: axellj: 'this is the requirement, there is nothing either of us can do about it'
[2013-07-22 05:59:31] adamgoucher: webdriver acts as a user to interact with the browser. users who are not logged in cannot, pretty much by definition, interact with a browser
[2013-07-22 05:59:52] axellj: I read about some people managing to run it as a windows service using a wrapper
[2013-07-22 06:00:31] adamgoucher: yes, you 'can', but that is completely unsupported and is actually officially discouraged by the project

[2013-07-22 06:01:48] AutomatedTester: axellj: you can create a new user just for that service and lock down what they can access
[2013-07-22 06:02:07] axellj: yeah, that's what I'm trying to negotiate

[2013-07-22 06:02:43] adamgoucher: it shouldnt be a negotiation … if your company wants to run se on windows, this is what you have to do
[2013-07-22 06:02:57] AutomatedTester: either you have a machine with the user logged in or a new user for the service that has desktop
[2013-07-22 06:02:59] AutomatedTester: either or

[2013-07-22 10:01:42] jimevans: i'd like to see how you've archtected the server component.
[2013-07-22 10:02:04] alagabes: and it works, but the problem is this stupid WebBrowser controller on WP will return only a last evaluated string, there's no other way to get any data from js engine
[2013-07-22 10:02:39] alagabes: jimevans: not yet, this is quite poorly created code, I'd rather want to work on it somemore before pushing it somewhere
[2013-07-22 10:03:08] jimevans: alagabes: so you've implemented the HTTP server using, what, .NET? c++?
[2013-07-22 10:03:14] alagabes: C#
[2013-07-22 10:03:38] alagabes: .NET C#, this is just WP 8 app
[2013-07-22 10:03:52] jimevans: did you look at the strontium project for a .net remote server implementation you could steal?

[2013-07-22 10:04:12] alagabes: jimevans: I haven't heard of it
[2013-07-22 10:04:27] alagabes: but WP 8 API is quite different thant the normal .NET
[2013-07-22 10:04:32] jimevans: yes, it is.
[2013-07-22 10:04:39] Prometheian: If I'm running JUnit tests via command line, is there a way to have it either catch the failures and store them, or run them again?
[2013-07-22 10:04:44] alagabes: there are only async network functions
[2013-07-22 10:04:59] alagabes: let me check the strontium
[2013-07-22 10:05:46] jimevans: but from an architecture point of view you'll be hitting the same problems.
[2013-07-22 10:06:51] jimevans: also, are you simply creating an app that instantiates a webbrowser control (the same approach as the first-gen android and iphone drivers used), or are you using something like ui automation to control the actual IE installed on the device?

[2013-07-22 10:25:32] alagabes: my server works like this right now, you have a HTTPServer object, where you can register a handler,
[2013-07-22 10:25:35] alagabes: this.RegisterHandle(
[2013-07-22 10:25:35] alagabes:                 new ApiPattern(WebRequest.WebRequestMethod.Post, "/session/:sessionId/url"),

[2013-07-22 10:26:28] alagabes: I think you get the idea
[2013-07-22 10:26:38] jimevans: yep. looks reasonable.
[2013-07-22 10:26:49] alagabes: I don't know if that's a good approach, it seemd for me to very straightforward
[2013-07-22 10:27:03] alagabes: anyway, for me now, js is the biggest struggel
[2013-07-22 10:27:27] alagabes: since I'm not good at working with it, and the WebBrowser controller limitation

[2013-07-22 11:36:32] __rockbot__: hi! any recommendations for getting started with selenium tests?
[2013-07-22 11:36:42] __rockbot__: ideally there'd be a step-by-step guide...?
[2013-07-22 11:37:09] Dude-X: well
[2013-07-22 11:37:22] Dude-X: __rockbot__: you want to write UI tests?
[2013-07-22 11:37:30] Dude-X: i don't know if there's a step by step guide
[2013-07-22 11:37:50] __rockbot__: Dude-X: yes, UI tests are the goal :-)
[2013-07-22 11:38:02] Dude-X: i can give you advice
[2013-07-22 11:38:10] Dude-X: are you using webdriver?
[2013-07-22 11:38:24] __rockbot__: yes
[2013-07-22 11:38:29] Prometheian: If I'm running JUnit tests via command line, is there a way to have it either catch the failures and store them, or run them again?
[2013-07-22 11:38:31] Dude-X: what langauge?
[2013-07-22 11:38:49] __rockbot__: preferably javascript
[2013-07-22 11:38:50] lukeis: junit == java ;)
[2013-07-22 11:38:54] __rockbot__: but i can do python
[2013-07-22 11:38:56] lukeis: oh
[2013-07-22 11:39:01] Dude-X: Prometheian: you'd have to either use Junit @Rules or use a scripting language to handle that
[2013-07-22 11:39:43] Dude-X: i think webdriver js is a work in progress compared to the python bindings
[2013-07-22 11:39:52] Prometheian: For the scripting language, do you mean build a shell outside of Java that runs and captures failures?
[2013-07-22 11:40:00] Dude-X: Prometheian: ys
[2013-07-22 11:40:13] lukeis: Prometheian: for JUnit, i use a @Rule for just that
[2013-07-22 11:40:21] Dude-X: otherwise you'd have to hook into Junit's test handling
[2013-07-22 11:40:29] Prometheian: Could you show me how you do it with @Rule?
[2013-07-22 11:40:49] Dude-X: that's beyond my ability unfortunately
[2013-07-22 11:41:22] lukeis: Prometheian: here's kinda the gist of it:  http://stackoverflow.com/a/12144220
[2013-07-22 11:41:28] Prometheian: Sorry, I meant lukeis. Ty.
[2013-07-22 11:41:44] lukeis: note you also need to add a reference in your Base test class
[2013-07-22 11:42:20] Prometheian: So in each test I would implement this into the @After?
[2013-07-22 11:42:30] lukeis: no

[2013-07-22 11:42:40] lukeis: i don't at least
[2013-07-22 11:43:16] phasze: hey nicegraham :)
[2013-07-22 11:43:42] Prometheian: You'll have to forgive my lack of knowledge. I'm still new to all this and I'm modifying a system that was already in place. By a reference in my Base test, do you mean some kind of CoreUtilities type deal?
[2013-07-22 11:44:11] lukeis: your test class "extends" something right?
[2013-07-22 11:44:17] towski, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-07-22 11:44:37] lukeis: all your tests could / should extend a 'Base' class for testing so you can do something like… add a @Rule to all test classes ;)
[2013-07-22 11:45:08] Dude-X: yeah that's a good thing
[2013-07-22 11:46:02] Prometheian: extends testbase.TestBase {
[2013-07-22 11:46:13] Prometheian: So I would do an @Rule in the code.
[2013-07-22 11:46:24] lukeis: then in TestBase you add @Rule
[2013-07-22 11:46:43] lukeis: and you need to create the Rule class (example i linked)
[2013-07-22 11:46:52] Prometheian: And in @Rule I call the function you showed me?
[2013-07-22 11:47:45] lukeis: the only thing in your base class:
[2013-07-22 11:47:46] lukeis: @Rule
[2013-07-22 11:47:46] lukeis:     public ScreenCaptureOnFailure testRule = new ScreenCaptureOnFailure();
[2013-07-22 11:48:14] Prometheian: Ah, okay. Thank you. :)
[2013-07-22 11:48:30] lukeis: ScreenCaptureOnFailure is a java class that implements TestRule  and you should Override the apply method
[2013-07-22 11:49:11] Prometheian: I got to test some tickets, and then I'll get back to you. ^^

[2013-07-22 12:15:39] AutomatedTester: lukeis: I can use stash to do what I want
[2013-07-22 12:15:52] lukeis: certainly one way to do it :)
[2013-07-22 12:16:22] AutomatedTester: lukeis: or
[2013-07-22 12:16:23] AutomatedTester: ?
[2013-07-22 12:16:24] lukeis: you can also add the commits and then `git rebase -i HEAD~5`  and then simply delete the revisions from the history

[2013-07-22 12:16:45] lukeis: it doesn't delete the commit… just detaches them from your branch
[2013-07-22 12:16:46] AutomatedTester: lukeis: rebase is too heavy weight for my needs
[2013-07-22 12:16:58] lukeis: doesn't actually rebase
[2013-07-22 12:17:09] lukeis: well… i mean, not as heavy as a real rebase
[2013-07-22 12:17:27] lukeis: but if you can do it with stash, then by all means :)
[2013-07-22 12:18:26] AutomatedTester: if I have 3 patches and want to pop patches 1 and 3 and land 2 rebase feels like I will be annoyed
[2013-07-22 12:18:53] AutomatedTester: "grrr wtf are you doing git, just pop the patch muthachuffer!!!!??!?!?!?!"
[2013-07-22 12:19:05] lukeis: in the editor when you are rebasing interactively you can reorder or delete individual commits
[2013-07-22 12:19:17] lukeis: deleting the line merely detaches it from your branch
[2013-07-22 12:19:25] lukeis: like popping it
[2013-07-22 12:19:31] AutomatedTester: and if I want to push it back?
[2013-07-22 12:19:33] lukeis: er stashing it ;)
[2013-07-22 12:19:41] lukeis: git cherry-pick REV
[2013-07-22 12:19:55] lukeis: git reflog will be your friend in this type of workflow
[2013-07-22 12:21:00] AutomatedTester: so I go from hg qpop and hg qpush to doing git rebase -i HEAD^x and cherry picking and looking at the log?

[2013-07-22 15:31:02] kyled: I am trying to perform a file upload using selenium and auto it. When the file selection dialog shows, my tests hang for some reason. Is this a known bug? I am writing my tests in php.

[2013-07-22 15:35:09] kyled: dude-x: so there is their a  work around for this? I haven't seen sendkeys for the JsonWireProtocol . Using the value function did not work either... It would seem rather hackey to launch another process before i click the link that makes the dialog show. Mabey i can hack the bindings so it can force return from w/e it is doing? Or perhaps a manual mouse down and up event can get around this...
