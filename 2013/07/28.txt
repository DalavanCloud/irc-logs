[2013-07-28 12:45:18] WillPittenger: When I call org.openqa.selenium.TakesScreenshot.GetScreenshot, is there a way to have it return a java.io.File that isn't temporary?  Looks like if you pass OutputType.FILE, you get a temporary file that is deleted when the JVM exits.
[2013-07-28 12:47:30] WillPittenger: The other option would be to save the page to the drive.
[2013-07-28 12:54:06] dimacus, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-07-28 12:55:16] nicegraham: WillPittenger: why don't use just copy the temporary file to somewhere permanent? that's what I do if I want to keep it.
[2013-07-28 12:59:51] WillPittenger: Too bad java.io.File doesn't have a copy method.
[2013-07-28 13:01:24] nicegraham: yeah, but it's not hard to copy a file :)
[2013-07-28 13:02:08] WillPittenger: Ah.  Apache Commons FileUtils.
[2013-07-28 13:02:32] barancev: nicegraham: selenium has org.openqa.selenium.io.FileHandler class
[2013-07-28 13:02:55] barancev: that provides copt methods
[2013-07-28 13:03:04] barancev: a simplified version of FileUtils, yes

[2013-07-28 13:04:30] barancev: guava com.google.common.io.Files is usable too
[2013-07-28 13:04:44] barancev: and selenium distro incudes guava

[2013-07-28 15:29:55] swente: WillPittenger: same difference as in clicking the "reload-button" and re-entering the same url?
[2013-07-28 15:34:09] WillPittenger: swente: The main difference would be if data was sent with the URL.  Firefox would ask if you wanted to resend the data.
[2013-07-28 15:34:24] WillPittenger: No would cancel.
[2013-07-28 15:35:21] swente: WillPittenger: (perhaps i did mis-understand you entirely). did you *expect* a "refresh"-function to behave like get(<currenturl>)?
[2013-07-28 15:35:55] WillPittenger: No.  Not now that I think about it.  Your statement got me thinking.  It would be the same for my URL though. ;)
[2013-07-28 15:36:30] swente: WillPittenger: *i* would expect "refresh" to behave like e.g. firefox - *asking* for re-sending POST-data..
[2013-07-28 15:36:49] swente: (re-typing the URL would simply GET the url .. not the same in this case)
[2013-07-28 15:37:00] WillPittenger: Which would be an issue if your code can't tell it what option to use.
[2013-07-28 15:37:29] swente: an API should do it, as requested, as the programmer should understand "refresh" the way it is meant :)
[2013-07-28 15:38:20] swente: it depends on what kind of user-behaviour you want to emulate.
