[2013-07-10 07:32:39] barancev: andreastt: that's what I see when I try to use opera with chromedriver2 -- https://gist.github.com/barancev/5966779
[2013-07-10 07:33:15] barancev: it can start and stop the browser instance, but it can't connect
[2013-07-10 07:33:55] andreastt: Okay, well that seems pretty fatal.
[2013-07-10 07:34:02] barancev: does opera 15 support remote debugging API?
[2013-07-10 07:34:09] andreastt: AFAIK noone has worked on exposing the correct listening interfaces for the remote debugger.
[2013-07-10 07:34:12] andreastt: Yes.

[2013-07-10 07:44:38] deadweasel: someone here told me to install FIREDIFF, it shows the DOM changes over time, so you can see what the last element loaded is.
[2013-07-10 07:44:43] deadweasel: it's a FF extension.

[2013-07-10 07:45:49] deadweasel: use the FIREDIFF, it will let you know why.
[2013-07-10 07:46:31] deadweasel: or wait.until(ExpectedCondition.visiblityOfElementLocated(By.id("id string")));
[2013-07-10 07:46:57] deadweasel: so you can use WebDriverWait to instantiate the wait.  then use it like above.
[2013-07-10 07:47:33] deadweasel: Dude-X: I'm not sure how to make an expected condition out of a custom Wait class...
[2013-07-10 07:48:14] deadweasel: would like to use wait.untilAnimatedIsDone() on that link.

[2013-07-10 07:51:42] deadweasel: java
[2013-07-10 07:51:53] Dude-X: then you can simply create an ExpectedCondition
[2013-07-10 07:52:08] Dude-X: if you look at the source code, you can see how the other expected conditions are written
[2013-07-10 07:52:39] Dude-X: i would do it differently
[2013-07-10 07:53:10] deadweasel: can I just put "selenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow().jQuery.active == 0" into the expected condition?

[2013-07-10 07:54:39] Dude-X: well Java lacks first class functions, so you have to do the wrapping inside an ExpectCondition class that expects a boolean
[2013-07-10 07:55:38] deadweasel: hmm.  i'll hammer on that for a bit, see where I get.   thks!
[2013-07-10 07:56:09] Dude-X: but i would take a string that represents a jquery selector (which is like CSS selectors) and then check for "return $j('%s').filter(':animated') === 0;"

[2013-07-10 08:20:26] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I am going to create a test runner
[2013-07-10 08:20:33] Ardesco: addition?  I mean edition
[2013-07-10 08:20:37] AutomatedTester: andreastt: so that we can easily switch on/off tests
[2013-07-10 08:20:59] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Okay.  I quite like that fact nose deals nicely with non-classy tests.
[2013-07-10 08:21:09] AutomatedTester: andreastt: and that will live in the tree so the only dependency is selenium

[2013-07-10 08:21:24] andreastt: I think the whole class thing unittest forces one into is pointless for these kind of tests.
[2013-07-10 08:21:44] peshom: AutomatedTester: Thanks. That's true.... I'll try vim/sublime first.
[2013-07-10 08:21:53] AutomatedTester: andreastt: Mozilla doesnt allowed external dependencies in the tree
[2013-07-10 08:22:11] AutomatedTester: andreastt: so this way people can plug their version of selenium in where they need
[2013-07-10 08:22:20] AutomatedTester: be it selenium or marionette from their tree
[2013-07-10 08:23:17] andreastt: Rolling our own test runner seems like extra work
[2013-07-10 08:23:37] AutomatedTester: its not that much work
