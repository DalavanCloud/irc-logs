[2013-07-12 04:34:28] barancev|2: it seems to be a bug in closure library

[2013-07-12 04:39:42] andreastt: Sounds like the patch is to use :root or something.

[2013-07-12 19:18:17] matelot: Can one switch to frame by index ?
[2013-07-12 19:18:31] Dude-X_: i think so

[2013-07-12 19:21:23] Dude-X_: intersting
[2013-07-12 19:22:35] Dude-X_: switch_to_frame takes an index (0 for the first iframe, 1 for the second...), id (<frame id='blah'), or name <frame name='inner'>

[2013-07-12 19:38:35] matelot: <iframe src="...someurl..."    How to get the "src" attribute ? I wonder if I can access the URL
[2013-07-12 19:38:52] whhone, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-12 19:40:47] Dude-X_: as long you're not in the iframe itself
[2013-07-12 19:41:11] Dude-X_: you can do d.find_element_by_tag_name('iframe').get_attribute('src')
