[2013-07-11 01:55:16] AutomatedTester: 99% sure we dont

[2013-07-11 02:00:31] AutomatedTester: no idea
[2013-07-11 02:00:54] AutomatedTester: are you using a java webserver? tomcat/websphere etc/
[2013-07-11 02:00:56] AutomatedTester: ?
[2013-07-11 02:01:13] Ardesco: so anybody got any suggestions for enforcing the default locale for all selenium tests to GB ?
[2013-07-11 02:01:38] andreastt: jsessionid comes from Java Servlets, not the servers itself.
[2013-07-11 02:02:42] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: update general.useragent.locale in firefox profile to en-GB
[2013-07-11 02:02:49] gentoonoob_: oh ok then the problem must be related 2 the application ?
[2013-07-11 02:03:01] AutomatedTester: gentoonoob_: more than likely
[2013-07-11 02:03:08] Ardesco: is that possible via desiredCapabilities or do I need to start generating profiles
[2013-07-11 02:03:27] andreastt: gentoonoob_: Yes.  Selenium does nothing to your HTTP requests.
[2013-07-11 02:03:40] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: profiles
[2013-07-11 02:03:48] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: and its not cross browser :/
[2013-07-11 02:04:24] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: probably the best way is to install a version of the browser with that locale
[2013-07-11 02:04:30] AutomatedTester: on the VM

[2013-07-11 02:05:05] davehunt: could you use a proxy and set the locale in the header?
[2013-07-11 02:05:38] davehunt: http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-accept-lang-locales
[2013-07-11 02:06:13] davehunt: I guess it depends on how locales are implemented in the AUT
[2013-07-11 02:09:56] Ardesco: the problem is not that I wan't to run in different locales, the problem is that we have a Spanish team checking out our codebase and running the tests and they are failing because their locale is Spanish and our app gets translated to spanish
[2013-07-11 02:10:36] Ardesco: which means that we need to ensure the tests run in enlist so that they pass

[2013-07-11 02:15:38] AutomatedTester: zac_sel: could comment better than me ;)
[2013-07-11 02:15:42] Ardesco: silly thing is they are running our tests in a VM so that they don't have to install anything on their machines
[2013-07-11 02:15:52] Ardesco: but the VM can't have an en_GB locale...
[2013-07-11 02:15:53] zac_sel: what what!
[2013-07-11 02:15:56] Ardesco: ;)
[2013-07-11 02:16:08] AutomatedTester: zac_sel: the fun of working with TEF
[2013-07-11 02:16:33] davehunt: Ardesco: for mozilla sites we redirect to a URL containing the locale, so we just force that to be en-US within our tests
[2013-07-11 02:17:16] p_l: AutomatedTester: Firefox Portable is basically Firefox configured to run from a directory without anything else on the system (so the profiles are also in that directory)
[2013-07-11 02:17:33] Ardesco: we have to have the same URL no matter which locale
[2013-07-11 02:17:47] Ardesco: but that's a damn good idea
[2013-07-11 02:17:52] zac_sel: I guess you need to add IDs and use locators that are not content sensitive
[2013-07-11 02:18:19] AutomatedTester: p_l: Yea I saw from looking it up
[2013-07-11 02:18:27] Ardesco: ID's and locators aren't the issue
[2013-07-11 02:18:32] Ardesco: it's data we check
[2013-07-11 02:18:46] Ardesco: we have to check some numbers pumped out by the app, but they are localised
[2013-07-11 02:18:56] Ardesco: so 3,000 becomes 3.000
[2013-07-11 02:19:24] Ardesco: and checking dates are as expected
[2013-07-11 02:21:03] zac_sel: yes I see
[2013-07-11 02:22:13] Ardesco: not many because we actively don't check copy
[2013-07-11 02:22:18] Ardesco: but enough to break a few tests :)

[2013-07-11 04:46:45] andreastt: I see.
[2013-07-11 04:47:07] AutomatedTester: and looking at our visiblity code we dont handle hidden attribute
[2013-07-11 04:48:28] AutomatedTester: reading a Steve Faulkner blog post people should do <p hidden style="display:none" aria-hidden='true'> as markup
[2013-07-11 04:48:51] AutomatedTester: so if the markup is like above we are fine
[2013-07-11 04:49:01] AutomatedTester: but if its <p hidden> we say its visible
[2013-07-11 04:49:24] AutomatedTester: or even <p hidden aria-hidden='true'>
[2013-07-11 04:49:41] AutomatedTester: the aria stuff doesnt matter tbh
[2013-07-11 04:49:43] andreastt: Which takes presedence or the hidden attribute and the CSS styling?  The attribute?
[2013-07-11 04:49:55] andreastt: s/or/of/
[2013-07-11 04:50:07] AutomatedTester: the attribute
[2013-07-11 04:50:19] AutomatedTester: the style is for browsers that dont understand the style
[2013-07-11 04:50:27] AutomatedTester: the style is for browsers that dont understand the attribute
[2013-07-11 04:51:05] andreastt: Right, I see.  Handling the aria-hidden would be nice I guess.
[2013-07-11 04:51:21] AutomatedTester: would be nice but our code is sighted biased
[2013-07-11 04:51:35] o3u, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-11 04:51:36] andreastt: But that the aria-hidden variable is set doesn't mean the browser respects it.
[2013-07-11 04:51:41] andreastt: It could e.g. not be implemented .
[2013-07-11 04:51:52] AutomatedTester: if only aria-hidden acted like hidden attribute

[2013-07-11 05:51:10] andreastt: Greetings!
[2013-07-11 05:51:47] Unode: I'm currently having some issues with FirefoxWebdriver running inside xrfb. The hard part is that two identical machines, but one slower than the other are producing different results
[2013-07-11 05:52:29] Unode: in addition I've tried to do stepwise execution of the tests and it boiled down to element.click() not triggering the event in the slower machine
[2013-07-11 05:53:22] Unode: this .click() should trigger a javascript event which creates a pop-up
[2013-07-11 05:53:24] p_l: heh. Better than finding out that your browser stopped acting on click() at all
[2013-07-11 05:53:50] Unode: p_l well, other tests are passing which use .click()
[2013-07-11 05:54:00] Unode: so it's some sort of edge case
[2013-07-11 05:54:16] llaskin: Unode have you used explicit waits?
[2013-07-11 05:54:33] llaskin: because your description of "one machine being slower then the other" points to a lack of waits setup to account for machine differences
[2013-07-11 05:54:35] p_l: Unode: I had an edge case where IE completly stopped reacting to click on some elements - even when I grabbed the mouse and clicked on the damend link.
[2013-07-11 05:54:58] Unode: llaskin, you mean WebDriverWait or sleep() ?
[2013-07-11 05:55:04] *p_l since then has been considering naming his workaround method "clickClickMotherfucker()"'
[2013-07-11 05:55:29] Unode: llaskin, I've recently dropped implicit wait in favor of WebDriverWait
[2013-07-11 05:56:11] Unode: I have it on the find_element call which in some cases is an issue, but on the step by step debugging I did, everything was ok up until the .click()
[2013-07-11 05:56:40] llaskin: wEBdRIVERwAIT
[2013-07-11 05:56:41] Unode: what seemed to be the case is that the element to be clicked was at the edge to the screen and requires scrolling the page
[2013-07-11 05:56:44] llaskin: woops
[2013-07-11 05:56:46] llaskin: WebDriverWait
[2013-07-11 05:56:49] llaskin: since you are still on RC

[2013-07-11 05:57:14] AutomatedTester: llaskin: play nice

[2013-07-11 06:41:05] AutomatedTester: Unode: the DOM starts getting built and rendered as the browser engine receives the information
[2013-07-11 06:41:28] AutomatedTester: so we could have a page rendered and painted but still be downloading the JavaScript
[2013-07-11 06:41:54] AutomatedTester: which means the javascript might not have attached a listener to the DOM node when you try click

[2013-07-11 06:42:18] Unode: the link is present since the page renders, and as I explained before, I tried to execute the code stepwise, with a few seconds in between, and it only failed on the .click() part, not before
[2013-07-11 06:42:25] Unode: meaning, finding the element was not a problem
[2013-07-11 06:43:01] jimevans: so where can i discover the differences between chromedriver 2.0 and 2.1? there don't seem to be release notes or a changelog, unless i'm missing them.
[2013-07-11 06:43:17] Unode: AutomatedTester, makes sense, but that would be solved by a long sleep() before click right?
[2013-07-11 06:43:39] AutomatedTester: Unode: maybe
[2013-07-11 06:43:59] melter: jimevans: if you find the answer, please let us know. was wondering the same thing
[2013-07-11 06:44:33] Unode: AutomatedTester, or in other words, since what is being linked is an anchor with an href, if javascript wasn't ready yet, it should navigate to the page pointed out by the link, right?

[2013-07-11 06:44:49] Unode: *what is being clicked is an anchor

[2013-07-11 06:44:56] AutomatedTester: i guess
[2013-07-11 06:45:00] AutomatedTester: Unode: can we see the page
[2013-07-11 06:45:12] Unode: I can take screenshots if that helps
[2013-07-11 06:45:27] AutomatedTester: I would like to see the markup
[2013-07-11 06:45:40] melter: jimevans: they fixed the log spamming, at the very least

[2013-07-11 06:46:12] Unode: AutomatedTester, part of the page is dynamically altered, do you want it before or after this step?
[2013-07-11 06:46:30] AutomatedTester: Unode: what error are you getting again?
[2013-07-11 06:47:15] Ardesco: jimevans: is there a way to tweak registry setting for the IEdriver IE instance using GetOptionKeyPath?
[2013-07-11 06:47:52] Ardesco: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa753258.aspx
[2013-07-11 06:48:03] Unode: AutomatedTester, it's more a lack of behavior than an error. I do find_element... , I get the element and then do element.click(), the browser scrolls to the location and focus the element but it's like the click never happens
[2013-07-11 06:48:30] AutomatedTester: Unode: multiline link?
[2013-07-11 06:48:37] Unode: AutomatedTester, however this only happens on one machine. On another which is identical it works fine
[2013-07-11 06:48:41] Unode: AutomatedTester, will check
[2013-07-11 06:49:02] jimevans: Ardesco: interesting idea. however, i don't think you can get an IDocHostUIHandler from the IE browser instance. if you can, we'd be golden. :)
[2013-07-11 06:49:48] Ardesco: :/
[2013-07-11 06:50:20] Unode: AutomatedTester, no, single line but containing an image
[2013-07-11 06:50:33] Unode: should I click the image instead of the anchor?
[2013-07-11 06:50:42] AutomatedTester: Unode: can you try that
[2013-07-11 06:50:56] Unode: will do
[2013-07-11 06:51:02] AutomatedTester: that will probably be it
[2013-07-11 06:51:31] AutomatedTester: its like a <a href='<foo>'><span>foo</span></a>
[2013-07-11 06:51:39] AutomatedTester: that has caused issues in the past
[2013-07-11 06:51:43] Ardesco: looks like people are embedding IE to tweak settings
[2013-07-11 06:51:52] AutomatedTester: Unode: click on what the user would click
[2013-07-11 06:51:53] Ardesco: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2013430/set-browser-locale-in-internet-explorer-programmatically
[2013-07-11 06:52:45] Unode: AutomatedTester, hum.. that seems to work
[2013-07-11 06:53:32] Unode: I'll push this to all the testing code and see if it solves all the issues
[2013-07-11 06:53:38] Unode: AutomatedTester, thanks for the suggestion
[2013-07-11 06:53:39] Ardesco: jimevans: how about always starting IE in embedded mode? :)
[2013-07-11 06:54:14] jimevans: Ardesco: so i have to create a C++ application that embeds a webbrowser control? yuck. :)
[2013-07-11 06:54:19] AutomatedTester: Unode: I *think* what is happening is the rectangle around the <a> is top:0, left:0,width:0,Height:0 and we are getting lucky on the other machine
[2013-07-11 06:54:35] Ardesco: You could call it IEDriverDriver
[2013-07-11 06:54:45] jimevans: Ardesco: heh.
[2013-07-11 06:54:49] AutomatedTester: Unode: but if we do the image we get a proper dimesion of the element
[2013-07-11 06:54:57] AutomatedTester: and then can put our click in the right place
[2013-07-11 06:55:07] Ardesco: ah well no forced localisation for IE in my scripts I guess

[2013-07-11 07:02:18] AutomatedTester: peshom: It should work
[2013-07-11 07:02:21] AutomatedTester: if not its a bug
[2013-07-11 07:02:40] Dude-X: peshom: it should "just work". windows may have a  few issues though. but on mac/linux it's fine
[2013-07-11 07:03:14] peshom: AutomatedTester: I was able to figure out how to set up Eclipse to recognize the python binding for selenium, but it only works when I set python 2.7 as the interpreter.

[2013-07-11 10:17:12] matelot: Dude-X: Python

[2013-07-11 10:18:42] Dude-X: you may need the jar if you want to use RemoteWebdriver
[2013-07-11 10:18:42] jimevans: matelot: depends on how you want to use it. :)

[2013-07-11 10:21:10] jimevans: matelot: however, one of the ways you can use webdriver is to drive a browser installed on an entirely different machine. this is done using "RemoteWebDriver" (the client side of that is included in the language bindings download, so don't worry). for that functionality, you'd need a "server" implementation running on the target machine (where the browser you're driving is actually installed). that's implemented in java, and is a separate download.

[2013-07-11 10:22:39] jimevans: matelot: now, before you hit this, and come back screaming that we didn't tell you everything, and that you can't get it to work with IE or Chrome, you should be aware that you may want to download other components as well.
[2013-07-11 10:22:56] matelot: Do I need "IE Driver Server" ? -- the web app I want to automate is IE "recommened"
[2013-07-11 10:23:16] jimevans: matelot: yes, that's the piece you need.
[2013-07-11 10:23:21] jimevans: for IE anyway.
[2013-07-11 10:23:36] jimevans: and it runs on your local machine too.
[2013-07-11 10:24:14] jimevans: the language bindings should handle starting it up and shutting it down for you, so don't obsess about that.
[2013-07-11 10:24:26] jimevans: they just need to know where the executable file is.
[2013-07-11 10:25:10] jimevans: oh, and save yourself some pain. use the 32-bit executable.
[2013-07-11 10:25:20] matelot: so so I would need the Server ("selenium-server-standalone-2.33.0.jar")- if I want to.....what ?
[2013-07-11 10:25:36] jimevans: matelot: if you want to control a browser installed on a separate machine.
[2013-07-11 10:25:43] matelot: jim ah got it
[2013-07-11 10:26:36] peshom: Quick question: If a webpage element is in the source when the page loads, but is not visible to humans until another element is clicked on the page, can I "click" that initially-hidden element with the web driver without making it "visible" to humans first?
[2013-07-11 10:26:44] matelot: IEDriverServer.exe - is this install file or actuall run file ?
[2013-07-11 10:26:58] jimevans: matelot: that's the file actually run.
[2013-07-11 10:27:02] jimevans: not an installer.
[2013-07-11 10:27:09] jimevans: we don't do installers on this project.

[2013-07-11 10:27:23] matelot: jimevans: thx!
[2013-07-11 10:28:29] SamuraiJack__, quitting. (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[2013-07-11 10:28:35] jimevans: peshom: the right answer is "no", and the followup question is "why would you want to?" now, since you have the ability to run javascript via webdriver, then anything's possible, and all bets are off if you decide to go that way, because you're not accurately mimicking the user at that point.
[2013-07-11 10:29:39] matelot: so basically....the work-horse selenium code I "installed" - under Python binding - is all pure Python code ? no...DLL, EXE etc ?
[2013-07-11 10:30:06] jimevans: matelot: sort of.
[2013-07-11 10:31:11] matelot: OK i do see .so files
[2013-07-11 10:31:16] jimevans: matelot: each browser has its own implementation for actually driving the browser. for IE and chrome, those are compiled .exes written in c++. for firefox, it's a browser extension written mostly in javascript (with a few c++ components).
[2013-07-11 10:31:31] Dude-X: peshom: you will have to do appropriate waits before interacting
[2013-07-11 10:31:36] Dude-X: that's the hard part sometimes
[2013-07-11 10:32:10] jimevans: matelot: each of these browser implementations starts up an http server, and the language bindings use a json-over-http protocol to communicate with those implementations.
[2013-07-11 10:32:38] jimevans: the client-side communication parts are, however, entirely python. (for the python bindings)
[2013-07-11 10:33:35] matelot: jimevans: thx sounds cool, very eager to play and see if it's possible to automate this slow .net app...<rubs hands/>

[2013-07-11 10:40:39] jimevans: matelot: they provide examples in those specific languages as you go through the documentation.
[2013-07-11 10:40:47] jimevans: (or make them visible by default)
[2013-07-11 10:40:55] peshom: jimevans: Understood. In essence, you are saying the system might behave funky if I am not mimicking the actions a user would ordinarily have to take to accomplish something?
[2013-07-11 10:41:07] jimevans: peshom: that's exactly what i'm saying.
[2013-07-11 10:41:37] jimevans: depending on the architecture of the site, there could be no differences, or there could be vast differences.
[2013-07-11 10:41:49] peshom: jimevans: That actually makes a ton of sense... I probably should have picked up on that myself :). Thanks.

[2013-07-11 10:47:52] peshom: This might be my most basic question for the day: Can you "click" on a div element? Or do you have to "click" on the contents of the div? (say if the div was button and the button had an img or span tag)

[2013-07-11 11:11:40] peshom: deadweasel: I would say that is because I lack better understanding of CSS?

[2013-07-11 12:11:27] jimevans: deadweasel: you don't. if all <option> elements have that same class, you're out of luck doing a direct findElement. you'll need to find all of the elements, and loop through them to find the particular one you're looking for.
[2013-07-11 12:11:29] phasze: or just not worth it
[2013-07-11 12:12:12] jimevans: phasze: won't work. what if you start multiple instances of IE? then what happens when the first automated process ends?
[2013-07-11 12:12:12] phasze: I guess you wouldn't know if they wanted them all checked or unchecked
[2013-07-11 12:12:26] phasze: would it affect the IE's currently running?

[2013-07-11 12:14:38] phasze: yeah....good principle
[2013-07-11 12:14:44] dimacus: you have to hit a button or you have to hit a url
[2013-07-11 12:14:54] phasze: can't really do that with an automation service
[2013-07-11 12:15:07] dimacus: why not?
[2013-07-11 12:15:15] dimacus: you have your setup/teardown pre/post build stuff
[2013-07-11 12:15:34] dimacus: plus with CI… the boxes are a little more linient… that is actual users don't use those boxes
[2013-07-11 12:15:43] dimacus: so messing with stuff is slightly more allolwed
[2013-07-11 12:16:08] phasze: I was just thinking that the actual IEDriverServer.exe shouldn't require any setup when run
[2013-07-11 12:16:23] phasze: but I guess it *could*
[2013-07-11 12:16:38] phasze: setup being prompts for users
[2013-07-11 12:16:45] jimevans: dimacus: sure, and that's fine, but the IE driver can't cater to that use case. it *has* to work with the case of the user using it on his or her local machine.
[2013-07-11 12:17:26] dimacus: agreed, and this is why i propose of just taking care of it in the extras

[2013-07-11 12:18:01] dimacus: basically i'd like to be able to take a naked box, and have it test ready by running 1 command
[2013-07-11 12:18:12] lukeis: deadweasel: you can do a cssSelector to help… but I don't know your page or what you're trying to locate

[2013-07-11 12:39:30] lukeis: heya
[2013-07-11 12:40:01] brockfredin: So, the language bindings talk to the respective browser driver?  The driver sends HTTP commands to the browser itself, right?
[2013-07-11 12:40:22] lukeis: depends on the browser
[2013-07-11 12:40:40] lukeis: typically the driver sends http commands to a 'server' controlling the browser
[2013-07-11 12:40:58] brockfredin: What?  Where is this 'server'?  Confusing!
[2013-07-11 12:41:14] lukeis: Firefox, we use a Firefox Plugin that runs an embedded server that then in turn controls the browser by interpretting the http commands
[2013-07-11 12:41:23] jimevans, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-11 12:41:28] lukeis: Chrome, the server is chromedriver
[2013-07-11 12:41:35] lukeis: IE, the server is IEDriverServer.exe
[2013-07-11 12:41:54] lukeis: Safari, uses a user-extension plugin
[2013-07-11 12:41:58] matelot: oh i got it inputElement.click()
[2013-07-11 12:42:06] brockfredin: Okay, so I was right.  Language bindings talk to the driver(server) and that sends commands to the browser.  Vaguely.
[2013-07-11 12:42:14] lukeis: yes
[2013-07-11 12:42:33] brockfredin: But, Firefox is slightly tweaked, because it opens the plugin profile within firefox.
[2013-07-11 12:43:13] lukeis: each driver implementation is 'tweaked' ;)

[2013-07-11 12:43:43] lukeis: ios-driver / appium  use Apples Instruments to driver it
[2013-07-11 12:44:07] lukeis: the goal of the Selenium project is to offload the ownership to the makers of each of the Browsers
[2013-07-11 12:44:09] brockfredin: What specific people within the selenium project handle the Firefox driver?  Jim handles the .NET language bindings, right?
[2013-07-11 12:44:30] lukeis: everyone ends up touch Firefox driver right now ;)
[2013-07-11 12:44:52] lukeis: but in the future Mozilla has something called Marionette that is their implementation that they will be owning in the future
[2013-07-11 12:45:24] lukeis: and the Firefox driver as we know it dies (a slow death by being versioned out of existence)

[2013-07-11 13:37:36] swente: but i am generally new to selenium, and english is not my native language :).

[2013-07-11 13:38:59] dimacus: swente:  so what's up? what's the question i guess
[2013-07-11 13:39:17] barancev: who is the person to report closure bugs?
[2013-07-11 13:39:49] swente: dimacus: re-reading Selenium-Grid-Extras a couple of times to understand "where" into the game it belongs [extension or standalone-service of/next to hubs/nodes?]
[2013-07-11 13:40:15] dimacus: hmmm
[2013-07-11 13:40:29] cheezy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-11 13:40:38] dimacus: well i was thinking it could be a "manager" where it will start and manage the grid hub/nodes
[2013-07-11 13:40:51] dimacus: and give access to the OS that the node is running on
[2013-07-11 13:41:15] swente: ah, ic. so a "co-service" running next to each node, and a central counterpart to grid's hub?
[2013-07-11 13:41:54] dimacus: yes...

[2013-07-11 13:42:45] dimacus: one of the things i finished today was, downloading IEDriver.exe and adding it automatically to the path
[2013-07-11 13:42:55] dimacus: to help manage 100 windows nodes
[2013-07-11 13:43:33] dimacus: now working on disabling/enabling protected mode in IE7
[2013-07-11 13:43:49] dimacus: so basically it is to help manage all the little things that might come up during a test session
[2013-07-11 13:44:11] swente: what protocol do you use for grid-wide-communication? same as selenium itself?
[2013-07-11 13:44:42] dimacus: no not yet, simple HTTP gets for now until it gets more sophisticated
[2013-07-11 13:45:05] dimacus: if you start the grid-extras and go to localhost:3000/api it will list all of the end points
[2013-07-11 13:45:06] swente: not necessarily rocketscience if i wanted to add a single command
[2013-07-11 13:45:10] dimacus: and a description what it does
[2013-07-11 13:47:27] dimacus: swente:  there is also a servlette that we are adding to the grid hub that puts pretty HTML to all of that communication
[2013-07-11 13:47:35] dimacus: like screenshot of the desktop, etc..
[2013-07-11 13:48:22] peshom: *
[2013-07-11 13:48:29] swente: dimacus: (this one i have to translate precisely)  how do you "identify" nodes? i mean: currently here's tons of "nodes" running on the same box, on the same ip-address but just with different DISPLAY-vars [VNC-framebuffer]. so, if node's ip-address is your primary key, i would be lost again.
[2013-07-11 13:49:05] dimacus: i think we will identify them by SessionID
[2013-07-11 13:49:26] dimacus: and based on that try to pull info about that node… i havn't run into multiple display issue yet
[2013-07-11 13:49:31] dimacus: so that is very new

[2013-07-11 13:54:19] matelot: jimevans: just not sure how to locate the element, no unique id/name
[2013-07-11 13:55:00] jimevans: right. that's my point. your app has to be testable.
[2013-07-11 13:55:31] jimevans: as a last resort, you can do findElements(By.className("rtsLink")) and index into the collection returned.
[2013-07-11 13:56:07] jimevans: (or using css selectors, findElements(By.cssSelector(".rtsLink"))
[2013-07-11 13:56:15] swente: dimacus: you already have a ExecuteOSTask. might help me out. still, i might create a "FetchNodeEnvironmentalVariables" [os-independant, just calling java's System..]. gridextras is generally in an "usable" shape?
[2013-07-11 13:56:47] jimevans: make that findElements(By.cssSelector("a.rtsLink"))

[2013-07-11 13:59:40] swente: dimacus: i just hope it "basically" would be like implementing the task and wiring it. hope it won't take days to get into this.
[2013-07-11 14:00:01] matelot: jimevans:  I got    "does not support indexing" error  http://paste2.org/C9e1zbk7
[2013-07-11 14:00:15] swente: dimacus: as long as you're around i can't imagine it would get too problematic.
[2013-07-11 14:00:25] jimevans: matelot: errr, no. that won't work.
[2013-07-11 14:00:52] jimevans: you'll need to do a little hand-coding here.

[2013-07-11 14:01:04] jimevans: i'm not familiar enough with the python api to walk you through it.
[2013-07-11 14:01:09] dimacus: swente:  it shouldn't be too hard… checkout MoveMouse.java for a simple example, and you can use ExecuteCommand.execRuntime("") to make OS level commands like you would in terminal
[2013-07-11 14:01:57] jimevans: matelot: but you'll want to use webdriverwait such that you're waiting for the result of a find_elements (note the trailing 's') method call to have a count greater than 1.
[2013-07-11 14:02:18] jimevans: find_element() returns a single element (which can't be indexed). find_elements() returns a collection, which can.
[2013-07-11 14:03:00] jimevans: lukeis, AutomatedTester: is there a python expected condition for waiting for a number of elements matching a locator to appear?

[2013-07-11 14:04:39] matelot: jimevans: you mean there are 2 methods: find_elements_by_class_name and find_element_by_class_name ?
[2013-07-11 14:04:51] jimevans: matelot: exactly so.
[2013-07-11 14:05:33] matelot: is there presence_of_elements_located ?? <-- note "s"

[2013-07-11 14:23:07] matelot: jimevans: switch then find ?
[2013-07-11 14:23:12] jimevans: yep.

[2013-07-11 14:47:53] matelot: frame switching has to be by name ? not id ?
[2013-07-11 14:49:11] jimevans: name, index, or by finding the <frame> or <iframe> element and using that.
[2013-07-11 14:49:47] jimevans: so if you want by id, do element = find_element_by_id("frameid"), then switch_to_frame(element)

[2013-07-11 15:04:42] jimevans: any ideas?

[2013-07-11 17:39:29] matelot1: my main focus will be on IE  so...when will I need the IE Driver	? like under what circumstances/conditions..

[2013-07-11 17:43:31] santiycr: matelot1:  that will be every time
[2013-07-11 17:43:46] santiycr: as in, to run tests on IE, you need to have IEDriver in your machine

[2013-07-11 17:45:08] matelot1: santiycr: so I'm using the Python binding - just start the IE Driver then start my script ?
[2013-07-11 17:47:26] santiycr: matelot1:  just drop the iedriver.exe file somewhere in your computer's path
[2013-07-11 17:47:31] jimevans: matelot1: the python bindings should handle starting the IE driver exe for you.
[2013-07-11 17:47:50] matelot1: ah i see

[2013-07-11 17:54:12] matelot1: is it possible to use an existing instance of the browser ?
[2013-07-11 17:54:19] jimevans: matelot1: nope.
[2013-07-11 17:56:10] matelot1: OK but the browser object created in a Se session can/should be used repeatedly right ?
[2013-07-11 17:56:35] jimevans: matelot1: that's perfectly fine.
[2013-07-11 17:58:50] santiycr: matelot1: can be done, though I'm not the biggest fan of that approach. You'll be carrying cookies and cache around between your tests, which can cause lots of issues
[2013-07-11 17:58:58] jimevans: g'night everybody!
[2013-07-11 17:59:16] santiycr: matelot1: killing browsers and starting them is definitely the most reliable way to do testing

[2013-07-11 18:00:04] santiycr: I think so
[2013-07-11 18:00:15] santiycr: though you may run into some issues with IE
[2013-07-11 18:00:22] santiycr: when it comes to focus
[2013-07-11 18:00:31] santiycr: you can search for jim's talk at the last seconf
