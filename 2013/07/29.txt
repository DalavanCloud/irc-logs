[2013-07-29 07:28:14] santiycr: what's happening is really that iedriver never responds
[2013-07-29 07:28:32] santiycr: that's why you think the log is incomplete, because there isn't a log line for a response happening
[2013-07-29 07:29:06] santiycr: so sauce gives up and keeps sending user commands to the test, at that point Selenium keeps taking the commands but not responding to any of them
[2013-07-29 07:30:38] jimevans: santiycr: does the sauce infrastructure use the proxy capability to install a "sauce-standard" proxy?

[2013-07-29 07:32:49] jimevans: i don't. i'm just asking.
[2013-07-29 07:33:17] jimevans: i just landed proxy support in the IE driver native code (making the java code for proxies in IE obsolete).
[2013-07-29 07:33:27] jimevans: i'm hoping i didn't break anybody too badly.
[2013-07-29 07:33:34] jimevans: just checking in on that.
[2013-07-29 07:34:21] santiycr: well, sauce sets IE to proxy through the selenium jar, to add support for invalid https certs
[2013-07-29 07:34:24] intchanter-work, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-29 07:34:40] santiycr: but we don't use the proxy caps for that, we set it at windows level
[2013-07-29 07:35:05] jimevans: that's fine. shouldn't be any problem there.

[2013-07-29 07:37:00] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-29 07:39:13] jimevans: dhanush: use a "file://" url?
[2013-07-29 07:39:56] jimevans: but be aware that some browser (IE) will throw up a warning if the html file attempts to load javascript.
[2013-07-29 07:39:58] dhanush: jimevans: is this valid: driver.get("file://path/to/file")
[2013-07-29 07:40:23] jimevans: dhanush: depends on the OS. on windows, you might need a drive designator.
[2013-07-29 07:40:35] dhanush: im on linux jimevans
[2013-07-29 07:40:36] jimevans: also might depend on which browser you're using.
[2013-07-29 07:40:46] dhanush: firefoz and chrome
[2013-07-29 07:40:50] dhanush: *firefox
[2013-07-29 07:40:59] jimevans: are you getting errors?
[2013-07-29 07:41:07] andreastt: What errors are you getting?
[2013-07-29 07:41:51] *jimevans doesn't usually try to load html files directly from the file system, because it's usually a much different environment than browsing when served from a webserver.'
[2013-07-29 07:42:02] jimevans: (also, setting up a local webserver is not very hard)
[2013-07-29 07:43:07] dhanush: jimevans: ultimately I will put that file on the webserver. Its just an intermediate solution
[2013-07-29 07:43:10] santiycr: jimevans, barancev let me know if there's anything else I can help with to get that bug on iedriver down
[2013-07-29 07:43:13] dhanush: btw. it works. :)
[2013-07-29 07:43:25] andreastt: Debugging from local disk can be useful.
[2013-07-29 07:44:12] barancev: santiycr: I this it is an intermittent issue
[2013-07-29 07:44:13] dhanush: one more thing, any way to make the page wait for all the elements to load?
[2013-07-29 07:44:23] jimevans: andreastt: i suppose it can be, but automating it in some browsers (again, i say, IE) can be a pain in the neck.
[2013-07-29 07:44:50] andreastt: dhanush: Try setting the implicit wait through driver.manage().timeouts() IIRC.
[2013-07-29 07:44:50] jimevans: dhanush: not globally. use an explicit wait and wait for the element you're looking for to appear.
[2013-07-29 07:45:10] jimevans: andreastt: i hate implicit waits.
[2013-07-29 07:45:20] jimevans: we should never have made them part of the API.
[2013-07-29 07:45:35] andreastt: jimevans: The problem we were having (in the past) was that file directory listings were non scriptable documents.
[2013-07-29 07:45:51] andreastt: jimevans: So you'd be able to navigate anywhere, like a user, but once you reached such a page you were essentially in a deadlock.

[2013-07-29 07:46:13] jimevans: sure. i can see that.
[2013-07-29 07:49:38] dhanush: andreastt: jimevans implicit or explicit?
[2013-07-29 07:50:05] andreastt: jimevans' approach is more reliable.
[2013-07-29 07:50:20] jimevans: dhanush: andreastt says set the implicit wait timeout. i say don't do that, use an explicit wait (WebDriverWait class, or equivalent in your language binding)
[2013-07-29 07:50:41] dhanush: okay. explicit for me. sounds better.
[2013-07-29 07:51:21] schweens, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-29 07:51:22] andreastt: An explicit wait is basically saying: Don't move on until this condition evaluates to true, or you reach the designated timeout value.
[2013-07-29 07:51:52] dhanush: yeah. kind of/

[2013-07-29 09:02:11] jimevans: barancev: i remember you changed it for mouse events, but keyboard event had been using nsIDOMWindowUtils for awhile, iirc.

[2013-07-29 09:02:37] barancev: may be, I just did not touch keyboard implementation
[2013-07-29 09:02:57] jimevans: and if so, nsIDOMWindowUtils is marionette's mechanism for input events, so i'm probably okay with it.
[2013-07-29 09:03:08] jimevans: but we should check with AutomatedTester for confirmation on that.
[2013-07-29 09:03:50] barancev: I want to start a jihad against native events as the default mode
[2013-07-29 09:04:26] barancev: synthesized events work for all versions of FF, unlike native ones

[2013-07-29 10:38:39] dhanush: My test reports pass a little before the actual events take place in the browser.
[2013-07-29 10:39:21] dhanush: I mean I have a click() action on an id. So its the last of my test. I see 1 test passed and then after a couple of seconds the action is produced in the browser.
[2013-07-29 10:40:33] jimevans: dhanush: what are you asserting on after the click?
[2013-07-29 10:40:49] jimevans: because clicks are asynchronous.
[2013-07-29 10:42:08] seljenkinsbot: Project Firefox 22 Linux Synthesized Java Tests build #976: FIXED in 9 min 45 sec: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Firefox%2022%20Linux%20Synthesized%20Java%20Tests/976/
[2013-07-29 10:42:08] dhanush: jimevans: asserting? ummm nothing actually. so the click basically submits the login form and logs the user in.
[2013-07-29 10:42:39] jimevans: dhanush: then you'll need to synchronize on something after the form submission.
[2013-07-29 10:42:58] jimevans: like waiting for an element that you expect to appear on the first page after successful login.
[2013-07-29 10:43:18] mreedell-work, quitting. (Quit: Computer has gone to sleep.)
[2013-07-29 10:43:57] dhanush: jimevans: hmm..yeah makes sense. I would also like to make sure that login was successful so will your approach be good? or there is some other elegant solution too?
[2013-07-29 10:45:05] mreedell-work, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-29 10:45:29] jimevans: sounds like waiting for an expected element would be the right thing to do. in addition to making sure the click has been performed, it would also make sure the login was successful.
[2013-07-29 10:46:21] dhanush: jimevans: okay. so I want to seprate two actions into test. First is a successful login, Second is some other action inside the user profile page.
[2013-07-29 10:47:12] mreedell_, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-29 10:47:23] jimevans: i would absolutely avoid logging into the application via the UI for every test.
[2013-07-29 10:47:25] dhanush: So if I add that explicit timeout for that element that appears on a successful login in the last line of say def test_login(self) and then go onto define the next test as say def test_edit_profile(self)
[2013-07-29 10:47:30] dhanush: it will work ?
[2013-07-29 10:47:44] dhanush: jimevans: what alternative do I have?
[2013-07-29 10:48:02] jimevans: might do, but now you have tests that depend on one another, which should never, ever be the case.
[2013-07-29 10:48:26] jimevans: set up the logged-in session on the backend of the application, and navigate directly to the user profile page.
[2013-07-29 10:48:39] jimevans: maybe get an appropriate cookie, so that you're not prompted to login.
[2013-07-29 10:48:42] qaguy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-07-29 10:48:45] dhanush: jimevans: No no. Mine is such a scenario. Its basically a chain of events.
[2013-07-29 10:49:18] dhanush: jimevans: okay. I will do that when I have my basic test up and running. But its a good idea you know.
[2013-07-29 10:49:21] jimevans: dhanush: in my opinion, that's Doing It Wrong"
[2013-07-29 10:49:32] jimevans: but okay.

[2013-07-29 10:49:38] dhanush: jimevans: okay. so what should I do?
[2013-07-29 10:49:49] jimevans: i've already given you my opinion, but it's up to you.
[2013-07-29 10:50:35] jimevans: if you're going to insist on logging in through the UI for any test that requires logging in, you're going to find your tests run much, much slower than they ought to.
[2013-07-29 10:50:56] jimevans: but, hey, i really don't know what i'm talking about, so you might want to ask for other opinions.
[2013-07-29 10:51:09] dhanush: jimevans: yeah your opinion does make sense. Not that I am taking it without any thought. So I can actually put this all into a single test. But I am doing this, in case my application fails, I can pinpoint the exact failure quickly. The first in the chain of failures would be the root cause evidently.
[2013-07-29 10:51:48] jimevans: if that's the approach you want to take, that's fine.
[2013-07-29 10:52:16] jimevans: but please don't create separate tests that depend on one another. that's an anti-pattern, in my opinion
[2013-07-29 10:52:46] dhanush: okay. and I will probably put that cookie capture thing in once I have the basic structure up.

[2013-07-29 11:08:01] jimevans: jleyba: because it sucks?
[2013-07-29 11:08:03] Dude-X: only way to know is through javascript
[2013-07-29 11:08:24] Dude-X: web driver doesn't really pay attention to what's going on in a webbrowser
[2013-07-29 11:08:40] jleyba: lol.. I didn't know what to say.
[2013-07-29 11:08:51] jimevans: jleyba: because the IE driver is a piece of sh*t, and if they want it to get faster they should pull their finger out and fix it?
[2013-07-29 11:10:17] jleyba: Give yourself some credit.  Supporting 5 different versions of a terrible browser is quite an accomplishment
[2013-07-29 11:12:17] jimevans: oh, i give myself plenty of credit. random "why is the IE driver slow" questions without an understanding of how the driver works drive me up the wall, and i'm not inclined to be polite to those asking. especially people who should know better (like googlers). and to be clear, i'm not talking about you, jleyba, but the person that asked you. :)

[2013-07-29 11:12:59] dhanush: okay so I have an html element whose default display style is none. So on page load it is there but hidden. Now when an event is fired, it becomes visible. Any way to detect when it is visible and not just loaded?
[2013-07-29 11:13:19] dhanush: If not I will have to refactor my html code :(
[2013-07-29 11:13:53] jimevans: i mean a simple search, or a cursory glance at the IE driver code base would tell anyone there's a fair amount of javascript being executed. from there, it's a very short hop to realize that, "oh, IE's javascript engine, particularly in IE < 9 is really slow". :)
[2013-07-29 11:14:09] jimevans: dhanush: wait for element.is_displayed?
[2013-07-29 11:14:45] dhanush: jimevans: oh. Im really new, my first day at selenium. This was probably a stupid question. Thanks

[2013-07-29 11:42:39] lukeis: yep, but if you perform and then want more different actions, you need to have another Actions

[2013-07-29 12:03:42] dimacus: or CDN that seems to go down once a month
[2013-07-29 12:04:13] dimacus: it's fun to run a single test, and see how many exteral URLs get hit on a single page load :(
[2013-07-29 12:04:49] cgoldberg: dimacus, totally.  we're working on trying hermetic testing.  everything is local.

[2013-07-29 12:05:36] dimacus: well this option gives you ability to switch between hermetic and open in mid test suite run
[2013-07-29 12:05:47] cgoldberg: cool
[2013-07-29 12:06:01] dimacus: if you have 1 or 2 tests that actually test external urls… you start a new browsers session without a proxy
[2013-07-29 12:06:09] dimacus: and after that test, turn the proxy back on
[2013-07-29 12:07:00] cgoldberg: dimacus, besides flakiness.. you probably get a little performance increase in test runs.... bet your proxy is faster than a remote service
[2013-07-29 12:07:14] dimacus: yes
[2013-07-29 12:07:28] dimacus: but only a 1/2 of second or so per page load
[2013-07-29 12:07:50] dimacus: you really notice the difference when you look for build history for 3 months… and notice that all builds have a consistent run time
[2013-07-29 12:07:52] cgoldberg: .5 sec per pageload is still a *nice* savings on a big suite
[2013-07-29 12:08:13] dimacus: instead of that having that 1 day where all the tests just randomly time out :-P
[2013-07-29 12:08:37] cgoldberg: dimacus,  well done.  now write me one  in Python so I don't have to! :P

[2013-07-29 14:53:00] jimevans: liulk: haha. i can't count the number of times i've read that page over the last 3 years.
[2013-07-29 14:53:16] liulk: If IE starts in low integrity mode and IE driver in medium, then IE driver should be able to overwrite its objects right?
[2013-07-29 14:53:36] liulk: overwrite IE's objects.
[2013-07-29 14:55:30] jimevans: right, but it shouldn't go the other way. a low integrity process shouldn't be able to control a medium or high integrity process.
[2013-07-29 14:56:51] jimevans: however, when it comes to things like the cache, cookies and so on, if you run a medium integrity process (IEDriverServer.exe), and call certain APIs (like cache or cookie APIs), they reference a different place than if you launched the same application as a low integrity process.

[2013-07-29 15:36:07] detroniz_: anyone here uses PhantomJSDriver in Java?
[2013-07-29 15:36:11] lukeis: hola
[2013-07-29 15:36:45] detroniz_: My Maven is pretty pure and I have received a report that the jar coming back from Maven Central are still compiled with java7
[2013-07-29 15:36:47] lukeis: i have used it recreationally, but we haven't set it up in our CI
[2013-07-29 15:37:17] lukeis: tell them to upgrade to java 7 ;)
[2013-07-29 15:37:22] lukeis: selenium works with it :-D
[2013-07-29 15:38:08] lukeis: i don't have a system without java 7 installed, i forget how to easily verify that...
[2013-07-29 15:38:57] detroniz_: nah - I made the mistake to firstly release as build with java7
[2013-07-29 15:39:00] phasze: anyone have experience with spoon.net and running multiple IE's on one machine?
[2013-07-29 15:39:02] detroniz_: then recompiled and reuploaded
[2013-07-29 15:39:19] detroniz_: but there is a guy still complaining - and I have checked the binary by hand myself
[2013-07-29 15:39:28] detroniz_: maybe local/regional maven cache?
[2013-07-29 15:39:59] lukeis: did you bump the revision numbers right?
[2013-07-29 15:40:42] lukeis: maven central you can only upload an artifact for a particular number once… no 'updating' a release
[2013-07-29 15:44:58] detroniz_: shit!

[2013-07-29 15:48:15] phasze: dunno, haven't used it yet
[2013-07-29 15:48:21] lukeis: phasze: spoon.net is a virtualization of the browser, and selenium doesn't support it ;)

[2013-07-29 15:50:42] lukeis: i used to use it a bunch
[2013-07-29 15:51:09] lukeis: haven't tried it since they changed to requiring a login
[2013-07-29 15:51:17] phasze: I'd use it if it didn't cost money for legacy browsers :P
[2013-07-29 15:51:43] lukeis: esh… it was really awesome when it was free :)
[2013-07-29 15:52:15] timbo1: ah

[2013-07-29 15:54:02] timbo1: cause its addicting
[2013-07-29 15:54:41] lukeis: it was free until Microsoft saw what they were doing and sent a cease & desist… i'm sure they've managed a new ($) license agreement and are able to provide it now again
