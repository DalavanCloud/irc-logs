[2013-07-26 07:32:38] dimacus: i think this guy might be what i'm looking for http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682629%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
[2013-07-26 07:34:37] jimevans: dimacus: what are you trying to do (in broad terms)?
[2013-07-26 07:35:15] dimacus: i wanna see if selenium server/grid-node is running on say 5555… if it is running, get the pid of it so i can kill it at later date
[2013-07-26 07:36:04] dimacus: i used netstat for that previously… but for some reason when i exec Runtime via java, and wait for process to finish… it just hangs indefinetly
[2013-07-26 07:36:42] dimacus: i'm 98% sure it's some security setting i'm missing… but really don't want to have to go on a wild goose chase trying to figure out all of the security settings on windows boxes
[2013-07-26 07:37:01] jimevans: no, i'm pretty sure that's a rabbit hole you don't want any part of.
[2013-07-26 07:37:26] dimacus: plus i figured might as well learn some cpp on the side… can't hurt, right?
[2013-07-26 07:37:41] jimevans: no, i suppose it couldn't
[2013-07-26 07:37:58] dimacus: might help fixing IE driver bugs one day
[2013-07-26 07:41:02] jimevans: so EnumProcesses will give you a list of process ids but not much else.
[2013-07-26 07:41:56] cgoldberg: dimacus, i've done lots of monitoring (gasp, even on windows)... what are you after?
[2013-07-26 07:42:29] dimacus: cgoldberg:  basically need ability to run netstat/tasklist equivent on windows… but to do it in java code without exec shell
[2013-07-26 07:42:37] cgoldberg: i used WMI (mostly via Python, and sometimes C#)
[2013-07-26 07:42:49] dimacus: oh? example please?
[2013-07-26 07:42:50] jimevans: WMI might well be a good approach here.
[2013-07-26 07:43:08] cgoldberg: dimacus, i have plent of python examples.. would that help?
[2013-07-26 07:43:19] cgoldberg: python using the WMI package
[2013-07-26 07:43:42] dimacus: i guess it's a start
[2013-07-26 07:43:50] cgoldberg: WMI is a nightmare of a maze... but I somehow got what i needed.
[2013-07-26 07:43:51] cgoldberg: 1 sec
[2013-07-26 07:43:54] jimevans: COM components FTW! (wow, if that's not a phrase you'd almost never use)
[2013-07-26 07:44:09] *dimacus twitch twitch'
[2013-07-26 07:44:37] jimevans: the tricky bit about wmi is its pseudo-sql syntax. once you figure that out, you're halfway to your goal.
[2013-07-26 07:45:16] dimacus: i have about 2 or 3 years of experience with Powershell… so i think i have a little experience with psudo-sql syntax ;)
[2013-07-26 07:45:57] cgoldberg: dimacus, caveat.. i haven't worked on windows in years.  this post I wrote is 5 years old.. so you're mileage my vary :)

[2013-07-26 07:46:16] cgoldberg: it works for remote and local WMI
[2013-07-26 07:46:34] dimacus: damn dude… you are hitting on all of the things i crave
[2013-07-26 07:46:43] dimacus: uptime, cpu util, memory

[2013-07-26 07:48:42] dimacus: now integrating with windows makes me wheep
[2013-07-26 07:49:48] dimacus: cgoldberg:  and what do you know… there is Java -> WMI examples right there… no C++ needed
[2013-07-26 07:49:56] *dimacus single tear of happines'

[2013-07-26 07:50:41] cgoldberg: dimacus, jimevans... i wrote an entire Windows monitoring system back in the day :  https://code.google.com/p/perfmetrics/

[2013-07-26 12:17:40] asavchuk: Dude-X: yes, it can
[2013-07-26 12:18:08] Dude-X: interesting….
[2013-07-26 12:18:16] arex\\: i would be curious to know people's node configurations... which browser, how many instances, timeout settings, etc
[2013-07-26 12:18:37] Dude-X: i've been experimenting with docker; and i created a container with server and firefox
[2013-07-26 12:19:56] Dude-X: you can set up a container and just run instance of a browser per container
[2013-07-26 12:20:09] Dude-X: or maybe you can run 5 browsers per container
[2013-07-26 12:20:19] Dude-X: this would take benchmarking
[2013-07-26 12:20:50] Dude-X: arex\\: at a former employer, one project used 4 Mac minis that ran 4 instances of chrome per mac mini

[2013-07-26 12:31:09] phasze: I say system because I think it's GUI-less so that's why it cannot see it
[2013-07-26 12:31:52] jimevans: phasze: are you running your selenium tests as a windows service?
[2013-07-26 12:32:06] phasze: it's what I was going for
[2013-07-26 12:32:11] jimevans: yeah. don't do that.
[2013-07-26 12:32:13] phasze: but I think IT changed it to a group policy thing
[2013-07-26 12:32:17] phasze: ah
[2013-07-26 12:32:25] phasze: was hoping it could be done
[2013-07-26 12:32:29] phasze: so was experimenting
[2013-07-26 12:32:56] jimevans: if all goes well, i'm going to check in some changes to the IE driver soon that absolutely should not be used inside a windows service.
[2013-07-26 12:33:11] phasze: haha, what have you done? :)
[2013-07-26 12:33:25] jimevans: implementing proxy settings in the IE driver.
[2013-07-26 12:33:33] jimevans: but that uses wininet.
[2013-07-26 12:33:48] jimevans: and the docs explicitly say, "don't use wininet in a windows service"
[2013-07-26 12:33:55] phasze: lol
[2013-07-26 12:34:45] phasze: yeah I'm connected to a domain and due to security reasons we cannot have someone automatically start logged in
[2013-07-26 12:35:06] jimevans: you need to talk to your IT department.
[2013-07-26 12:35:11] phasze: I guess I'll just have to have this thing log in a special user and remember to change it's password every few months
[2013-07-26 12:35:13] jimevans: seriously.
[2013-07-26 12:35:24] jimevans: sit down with them face-to-face, and explain your needs.
[2013-07-26 12:35:51] phasze: we've been talking about it
[2013-07-26 12:36:00] jimevans: don't do it via email, or over the phone, sit somebody's butt down in a conference room or in an office and have a face-to-face conversation with them.

[2013-07-26 12:37:01] jimevans: if your company is a software company, let them know that their policies are hindering the delivery of product to customers.
[2013-07-26 12:37:34] phasze: it's more of the security required for the inside of the building
[2013-07-26 12:38:04] jimevans: if you're in an internal software shop that's part of a larger company that primarily does something other than deliver software to customers, you'll have to take a different route.
[2013-07-26 12:38:13] jimevans: phasze: i'm not really talking to you specifically
[2013-07-26 12:38:32] jimevans: it's more like i'm starting the process of thinking about a blog post that addresses this issue.
[2013-07-26 12:38:40] phasze: hehe I see
[2013-07-26 12:38:41] jimevans: and beginning the process of wordsmithing it here. :)
[2013-07-26 12:38:50] asavchuk: jimevans: hi! great that IE will have proxy support!
[2013-07-26 12:39:21] jimevans: asavchuk: don't get too excited. it kinda goes against my nature, but i'm going to do it anyway.
[2013-07-26 12:39:22] asavchuk: it will help me with some specific tests :)
[2013-07-26 12:39:50] asavchuk: jimevans: why?
[2013-07-26 12:41:04] jimevans: because the "change the system setting for the user's machine, then try to change it back when you're done" fails miserably when you try to use multiple instances of whatever is modifying the settings.
[2013-07-26 12:41:15] phasze: asavchuk: were you able to replicate that session not being released issue?

[2013-07-26 12:42:14] jimevans: you could implement some sort of refcount system, but refcounting sucks. you could try to set some sort of global flag, but globals suck.
[2013-07-26 12:42:20] asavchuk: jimevans: oh! so you solution will change it for system? as it was done in java?

[2013-07-26 12:42:40] asavchuk: jimevans: i thought you find solution for change it for process only :(
[2013-07-26 12:42:41] jimevans: except...
[2013-07-26 12:43:48] jimevans: IE doesn't give you access to any of the things you'd need to set the proxy settings for *only* a given instance of IE.
[2013-07-26 12:43:55] jimevans: it's just not available.
[2013-07-26 12:44:24] jimevans: unless you want to reimplement the IE driver as a browser helper object (bho)
[2013-07-26 12:44:29] jimevans: which i'm not going to do.
[2013-07-26 12:44:42] jimevans: because you can't install a bho without elevating your permissions. full stop.
[2013-07-26 12:44:58] asavchuk: phasze: yes, i'm able
[2013-07-26 12:45:29] jimevans: (registering a bho *has* to write to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE in the registry, and that's protected)
[2013-07-26 12:46:45] asavchuk: jimevans: i think that if set proxy using wininet and do not notify other instances and system about it it will be specific for process. so i was wrong :(

[2013-07-26 12:50:44] asavchuk: phasze: but it will not help in your situation. :) after setting these timouts node tried to quit at iedriverserver. but it just hangs at this operation. Event more - cleanup thread of node hangs too :)

[2013-07-26 13:37:12] lukeis: Actions()…..perform()  calls build().perform()  and essentially discards the queue because one did not store it locally

[2013-07-26 16:06:47] sibichakravarthy: yup
[2013-07-26 16:06:59] Dude-X: how did it end up there?
[2013-07-26 16:07:20] Dude-X: go to the python interpreter
[2013-07-26 16:07:24] sibichakravarthy: i moved it..shud it not be moved?
[2013-07-26 16:07:30] Dude-X: just type from selenium import webdriver
[2013-07-26 16:08:13] Dude-X: if you did pip install selenium it would install to a site-package folder in the system Python
[2013-07-26 16:08:17] Dude-X: if you want to isolate installations of libraries, then use virtualenv
[2013-07-26 16:08:39] sibichakravarthy: ok..i'll try from selenium
[2013-07-26 16:09:31] Dude-X: i suspect that because it's not in a standard directory (site-packages) that the path to other modules is borked.
[2013-07-26 16:13:18] sibichakravarthy: thnx a lot buddy
[2013-07-26 16:13:21] sibichakravarthy: it worked

[2013-07-26 17:48:51] davidlai: in the python bindings many of the non-action calls that return info without alterting the state will be decorated with @property.  Then when you call it using a (), it'll raise and error.
