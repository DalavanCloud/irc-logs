[2013-07-09 03:20:13] jamesoram: Hi, does anyone know how I can disable third-party cookies in web driver? Preferably in all major browsers. Thanks.
[2013-07-09 03:20:29] simonstewart: How come?
[2013-07-09 03:20:51] simonstewart: I mean, I can guess, but it seems like an unusual thing to do
[2013-07-09 03:21:32] jamesoram: I need to test an event-tracking system with third-party cookies disabled
[2013-07-09 03:22:28] simonstewart: It'll depend on the browser
[2013-07-09 03:22:34] simonstewart: Chrome has a command-line switch: http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/
[2013-07-09 03:22:41] simonstewart: --only-block-setting-third-party-cookies
[2013-07-09 03:22:57] simonstewart: With firefox, you'd need to set up a profile that disables cookies and then use that in your tests
[2013-07-09 03:23:20] jamesoram: I see. Isn't it possible to use a profile for Chrome too?
[2013-07-09 03:25:17] simonstewart: You'd use the command line switch for chome
[2013-07-09 03:25:23] simonstewart: The ChromeOptions should allow you pass it in
[2013-07-09 03:25:59] jamesoram: Interesting, thank you very much simonstewart :)
[2013-07-09 03:26:26] simonstewart: np
[2013-07-09 03:26:29] simonstewart: good luck!
[2013-07-09 03:26:36] jamesoram: cheers
[2013-07-09 03:27:38] Ardesco: or you could use a black hole proxy to stop third party sites being accessible

[2013-07-09 03:30:23] Ardesco: he's got an implementation somewhere but I can't find it atm
[2013-07-09 03:30:59] jamesoram: No worries, Google is my friend :)
[2013-07-09 03:31:25] Ardesco: aha https://gist.github.com/dimacus/5757573
[2013-07-09 03:32:03] jamesoram: would that work in a selenium grid?
[2013-07-09 03:33:58] Ardesco: I don't use grid
[2013-07-09 03:34:21] Ardesco: i would guess that it could
[2013-07-09 03:34:37] Ardesco: but you would have to run it on each node
[2013-07-09 03:36:06] jamesoram: I see, I'll try it

[2013-07-09 10:19:28] llaskin, quitting. (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[2013-07-09 10:19:59] phasze: nicegraham: well what I really want is a way to clean up the machine before a test to ensure it's in a good state.  For example if I have a machine set to run IE, chrome, and firefox, it would be nice before I start an IE test to close all IE and IEDriverServer processes on that machine if there are any left over.
[2013-07-09 10:20:19] phasze: Also would like to be able to see any available browsers
[2013-07-09 10:20:30] nicegraham: so you can only have 1 session per browser then?
[2013-07-09 10:20:32] phasze: so before I queue a test to see, ok I have 3 IE's that can run
[2013-07-09 10:20:39] phasze: yes, 1 session per browser
[2013-07-09 10:20:42] llaskin1: jarib, ok yea, i don't see anything in there
[2013-07-09 10:21:12] nicegraham: ok, well dimacus has already implemented a proxy which will fire before and after session
[2013-07-09 10:21:32] nicegraham: so you could use that or extend it to do commands based on the session browser
[2013-07-09 10:21:35] phasze: yeah but that presents a problem if an IE test is running and you start a FF test
[2013-07-09 10:21:39] davidlai, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-07-09 10:22:05] nicegraham: you just need to add logic to the @before to only do certain commands based on the browser
[2013-07-09 10:22:09] dimacus: the other option is to have your tests themselves call the kill commands
[2013-07-09 10:22:14] dimacus: but only for the browser they care about
[2013-07-09 10:22:18] phasze: yes, that's exactly what I need to do nicegraham
[2013-07-09 10:22:21] dimacus: what nicegraham said
[2013-07-09 10:22:32] phasze: where would I do that?
[2013-07-09 10:22:52] phasze: I can program it in myself if you tell me the files ;)
[2013-07-09 10:23:10] nicegraham: https://github.com/groupon/Selenium-Grid-Extras/blob/master/SeleniumGridExtras/src/main/java/com/groupon/seleniumgridextras/grid/proxies/SetupTeardownProxy.java#L69
[2013-07-09 10:23:22] nicegraham: or more likely create your own version of that file
[2013-07-09 10:23:28] nicegraham: but that's where you'd implement your logic
[2013-07-09 10:23:29] phasze: I can see the browser from that session?
[2013-07-09 10:23:37] nicegraham: yeah
[2013-07-09 10:23:39] phasze: lovely
[2013-07-09 10:23:41] phasze: thanks much :)
[2013-07-09 10:23:55] phasze: I'll look around and see what I can do
[2013-07-09 10:23:55] nicegraham: the proxy has access to the registry etc
[2013-07-09 10:24:02] nicegraham: so it has access to everything you need
[2013-07-09 10:25:00] phasze: so then the only thing I would need is to see which browsers are available
[2013-07-09 10:25:15] nicegraham: I think that's a seperate concern
[2013-07-09 10:25:27] nicegraham: by the time that code is accessed the session has been assigned
[2013-07-09 10:25:51] nicegraham: so you want to do that check prior to your session @before and @after
[2013-07-09 10:26:58] phasze: yeah, I would check the hub for available browsers before queueing one up
[2013-07-09 10:27:02] nicegraham: so something like https://github.com/nicegraham/selenium-grid2-api/blob/master/src/main/java/com/seleniumgrid2api/servlet/ProxyStatusJsonServlet.java
[2013-07-09 10:27:07] phasze: I can use yours for that
[2013-07-09 10:27:17] phasze: but would be nice to be built in to dimacus' ;)

[2013-07-09 10:27:43] nicegraham: we can't do everything for you :)

[2013-07-09 10:34:18] lukeis, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-07-09 10:34:40] phasze: go for it Paladin852
[2013-07-09 10:35:02] Paladin852: Trying to use the select command to work with drop down menus. All works great inside IDE.
[2013-07-09 10:35:21] Paladin852: When I try to export, I get # ERROR: Caught exception [ReferenceError: selectLocator is not defined]
[2013-07-09 10:35:25] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-09 10:35:28] phasze: C#?
[2013-07-09 10:35:37] Paladin852: Python 2 / Webdriver
[2013-07-09 10:35:47] Paladin852: IDE 2.2.0 ,FF22 if that helps
[2013-07-09 10:35:49] phasze: heh, I haven't fixed the python one, only C#
[2013-07-09 10:36:10] phasze: you'll have to modify the webdriver.js file and the python-wd.js file
[2013-07-09 10:36:40] phasze: well, more like "enhance" instead of fix :P
[2013-07-09 10:36:44] Paladin852: Okay, cool. Where would I find those? I noticed that was where the problem was, but I couldn't find the files to look at them
[2013-07-09 10:36:54] phasze: I'll give you a link here

[2013-07-09 10:44:11] deadweasel: I beleive so, others here have helped me already, a dev is looking into if this is a css or ajax call.
[2013-07-09 10:44:36] phasze: jQuery.Active==0    ;)
[2013-07-09 10:44:50] deadweasel: i'll give it whirl, thanks phasze !
[2013-07-09 10:47:08] smccarth_: I use "return $.active == 0"
[2013-07-09 10:47:33] phasze: ooo, does that get rid of any errors if jQuery isn't defined smccarth?

[2013-07-09 10:50:42] smccarth_: phasze: I dont know lol. I just always used $.active instead of jQuery.Active

[2013-07-09 10:51:21] lukeis: depends on how the dev's are using it I think… but both should be available

[2013-07-09 10:56:42] phasze: jQuery.active

[2013-07-09 10:57:19] deadweasel: crap, i'm using java.
[2013-07-09 10:57:27] phasze: you can still make a javascript call
[2013-07-09 10:57:30] deadweasel: it's going to be a long year.
[2013-07-09 10:57:33] phasze: lol
[2013-07-09 10:57:34] lukeis: deadweasel: did you copy / paste my line?
[2013-07-09 10:57:53] lukeis: you can test that 'javascript' in the Browser's javascript console btw
[2013-07-09 10:58:21] deadweasel: lukeis, not yet because I don't get it, I'll check out the JS console now. thanks!
[2013-07-09 11:00:56] lukeis: deadweasel: here's it a little better formatted: https://gist.github.com/lukeis/5959636   want me to explain each piece?
[2013-07-09 11:00:57] barancev|2: a question: how to emulate ENTER key in selenium ide using a new command sendKeys?
[2013-07-09 11:03:15] deadweasel: Lukeis, I get setting up the webdriverwait for an expected condition, but I get lost on the subsequent recursions...
[2013-07-09 11:03:28] deadweasel: so at about "apply" I lose it
[2013-07-09 11:04:10] lukeis: the recursion is inside the 'until' method (hidden from you)
[2013-07-09 11:04:21] lukeis: it's not really recursion though
[2013-07-09 11:04:24] lukeis: it's just a loop
[2013-07-09 11:04:40] lukeis: so, not at all recursion ;)
[2013-07-09 11:04:49] deadweasel: yup, poor word choice.
[2013-07-09 11:05:11] deadweasel: so we've got a 10 second max, waiting for expected condition.. that's about all I understand.
[2013-07-09 11:05:44] lukeis: the apply method gets called by the 'until' method, if the value returned by the apply is Non-null and Non-False it considers it successful and thus stops waiting
[2013-07-09 11:06:02] lytrogeek, changing nick to eanxgeek|log.
[2013-07-09 11:06:10] lukeis: if the condition is not met, it sleeps for 0.5 seconds and then retries until the time (10 seconds in this case) is reached
[2013-07-09 11:06:33] deadweasel: ah! ok.  I see it.
[2013-07-09 11:07:03] lukeis: if it hits 10 seconds, you'll get a TimeoutException thrown
[2013-07-09 11:07:37] lukeis: so if that happens, you'll either need to extend the timeout or adjust the condition which you are trying to match
[2013-07-09 11:08:03] lukeis: if it doesn't wait at all, that means the condition is already met (and if your page isn't updated then you'll need to wait for a different condition)

[2013-07-09 12:44:18] deadweasel: is there somethign I can put in a WebDriverWait.until() that will just wait a few seconds?
[2013-07-09 12:44:53] Dude-X: deadweasel: you can always use thread.sleep
[2013-07-09 12:44:59] Dude-X: or time.sleep on python
[2013-07-09 12:45:10] deadweasel: java, but I haven't been able to get that to work.
[2013-07-09 12:45:14] Dude-X: deadweasel: what kind of waiting do you want to do?
[2013-07-09 12:45:24] Dude-X: you probably need to synchronize on more points
[2013-07-09 12:45:30] deadweasel: there is a UI bug when the test moves to fast for a few commands.
[2013-07-09 12:45:55] deadweasel: I've tried this:   driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(2000, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
[2013-07-09 12:46:05] Paladin852, quitting. (Quit: Page closed)
[2013-07-09 12:46:10] deadweasel: but I don't see the 2 second wait occuring after each command.
[2013-07-09 12:46:12] Dude-X: that won't help
[2013-07-09 12:46:18] deadweasel: nope
[2013-07-09 12:46:26] Dude-X: that's not a wait for 2 seconds before each command
[2013-07-09 12:46:34] deadweasel: ah, what is it?
[2013-07-09 12:46:46] Dude-X: that's  wait up to 2 seconds when trying to locate an element command
[2013-07-09 12:46:47] deadweasel: oh, that setting the timouts
[2013-07-09 12:46:54] deadweasel: balls
[2013-07-09 12:47:00] deadweasel:  wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("sharePhnInactiveButtonIdTextControl")));
[2013-07-09 12:47:03] deadweasel: this works
[2013-07-09 12:47:17] deadweasel: but I can't find the element... all elements are present, the UI just hasn't caught up.
[2013-07-09 12:47:21] deadweasel: so I need a delay until it does.
[2013-07-09 12:47:29] deadweasel: I'll try thread.sleep again.
[2013-07-09 12:47:38] Dude-X: wait for an event that is somewhat related to that button
[2013-07-09 12:47:50] Dude-X: it maybe an element that appears before the button is rendered
[2013-07-09 12:48:17] Dude-X: do you have ajax going on? does the page have jquery or a big JS library
[2013-07-09 12:48:51] deadweasel: Dude-X: yes, we have ajax and jquery, most is css and we are trying to convert all to CSS....  so I'm having trouble telling which is which.
[2013-07-09 12:49:19] deadweasel: jquery.active is what I want to use.
[2013-07-09 12:49:36] AutomatedTester: tourdedave: hey chap, when are we meeting up again?
[2013-07-09 12:49:44] AutomatedTester: I can't see anything in my calendar
[2013-07-09 12:50:17] Dude-X: deadweasel: then the wait condition would be something like you're expeciting a boolean where jQuery.active === 0
[2013-07-09 12:50:41] Dude-X: you would have to use executeScript
[2013-07-09 12:50:47] Dude-X: and do the appropriate casts and stuff
[2013-07-09 12:50:49] deadweasel: yes, bingo.  lukeis set me up with that
[2013-07-09 12:50:57] deadweasel: but I have to get it correct
[2013-07-09 12:51:02] deadweasel: Thanks dude-x,
[2013-07-09 12:51:17] Dude-X: deadweasel: using firefox or the browser's inspector
[2013-07-09 12:51:25] deadweasel: firebug
[2013-07-09 12:51:26] Dude-X: if you have firebug
[2013-07-09 12:51:35] Dude-X: get an extension called "firediff"
[2013-07-09 12:51:40] Dude-X: it will load a tab called changes
[2013-07-09 12:51:42] deadweasel: firediff, ok.
[2013-07-09 12:51:46] Dude-X: then study all the dom changes
[2013-07-09 12:52:22] Dude-X: focus on the events that occur right before the button appears
[2013-07-09 12:52:29] Dude-X: then you wait for that element to appear
[2013-07-09 12:52:30] davidlai, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-09 12:52:40] Dude-X: (appear as in get element succeeds)
[2013-07-09 12:52:57] Dude-X: if there is a small UI change then you can wait for that element to be visible too
[2013-07-09 12:53:37] Dude-X: if animation is involved and it's a jquery widget you can also wait on that element to stop animating using jquery
[2013-07-09 12:53:42] deadweasel: oh my, this will be wildy helpful.

[2013-07-09 14:43:25] hirani: i am using perl bindings Selenium::Remote::Driver . is there a good known way to wait for all the content on a page to fully load before the driver moves with the test execution ?

[2013-07-09 14:46:19] hirani: Dude-X: hmm .. i suppose you mean , if there is jquery on the page or not .. ,etc. etc.
