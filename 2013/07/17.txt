[2013-07-17 02:08:39] barancev: dregin: yes, HtmlUnit has issues with JavaScript, in general
[2013-07-17 02:09:01] barancev: but it should not affect findElement method, imho
[2013-07-17 02:09:09] dregin: I wouldn't have thought so
[2013-07-17 02:09:13] barancev: there must be another cause for locator to fail
[2013-07-17 02:09:27] dregin: I hit the JS errors after I started using name instead of id
[2013-07-17 02:10:30] barancev: ah, WebDriverBackedSelenium!
[2013-07-17 02:10:48] barancev: yes, *this* wrapper uses lot of JS code
[2013-07-17 02:11:01] dregin: \o/
[2013-07-17 02:11:08] barancev: I'd suggest to avoid it
[2013-07-17 02:11:08] dregin: Can you suggest a different one?
[2013-07-17 02:12:13] barancev: just don't mix WebDriverBackedSelenium and HtmlUnitDriver
[2013-07-17 02:12:42] dregin: kk
[2013-07-17 02:12:52] barancev: because WebDriverBackedSelenium emulates "old selenium behaviour" in pure JavaScript
[2013-07-17 02:13:12] barancev: rather complex JS code, that can have issues with HtmlUnit

[2013-07-17 02:16:52] raboof: so WebDriverBackedSelenium uses the classes like org.openqa.selenium.internal.seleniumemulation.* ?
[2013-07-17 02:18:03] raboof: i noticed for example org.openqa.selenium.internal.seleniumemulation.Type will use either javascript or element.clear();element.sendKeys() to accomplish its task, and prefers the javascript route when available
[2013-07-17 02:18:30] raboof: that seemed odd to me, as the js method sends like 50kb of javascript to the browser, so that doesn't seem ideal to me
[2013-07-17 02:18:37] raboof: any clue about the rationale behind that?
[2013-07-17 02:18:50] raboof: or shouldn't I be using org.openqa.selenium.internal.seleniumemulation.Type at all?

[2013-07-17 06:05:30] pigmej: switch_to_frame...
[2013-07-17 06:05:30] pigmej: ok
[2013-07-17 06:05:31] AutomatedTester: we require explicit changes to each frame before interacting with it
[2013-07-17 06:05:41] AutomatedTester: otherwise we never find the element
[2013-07-17 06:05:47] pigmej: ok
[2013-07-17 06:05:48] AutomatedTester: since its not in the frame webdriver is in
[2013-07-17 06:06:08] pigmej: ok
[2013-07-17 06:06:35] pigmej: can I focus any netsted frame ?
[2013-07-17 06:06:40] pigmej: or ful path needed ?
[2013-07-17 06:06:48] AutomatedTester: also use until/until_not (see http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/py/webdriver_support/selenium.webdriver.support.wait.html) for your wait
[2013-07-17 06:07:03] AutomatedTester: you can focus on  it by index
[2013-07-17 06:07:05] AutomatedTester: or by name
[2013-07-17 06:07:13] AutomatedTester: but you need to walk down the frameset
[2013-07-17 06:08:19] pigmej: ok
[2013-07-17 06:08:22] pigmej: so another question
[2013-07-17 06:08:26] pigmej: wait = ui.WebDriverWait(browser, 10)
[2013-07-17 06:08:31] pigmej: will it wait for frames also?
[2013-07-17 06:08:34] AutomatedTester: driver.switch_to_frame(1); driver.switch_to_frame(2) will find the first frame, switch to it and then find the 2nd frame within the first frame

[2013-07-17 06:08:52] AutomatedTester: well yes
[2013-07-17 06:08:56] pigmej: ;D
[2013-07-17 06:09:08] AutomatedTester: you are using it incorrectly
[2013-07-17 06:09:36] pigmej: probably, just find it out
[2013-07-17 06:10:00] pigmej: I have to define condition probably ?
[2013-07-17 06:10:09] AutomatedTester: you want wait.until(lambda driver: driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "<your frame id>"))
[2013-07-17 06:10:25] AutomatedTester: that will wait until it find the first level frame of what you want

[2013-07-17 06:13:51] pigmej: but frame name="main"

[2013-07-17 06:14:41] AutomatedTester: pretty much
[2013-07-17 06:14:54] AutomatedTester: you may need to do other tweaks
[2013-07-17 06:15:08] pigmej: because it sill throws me 'not found' ;/
[2013-07-17 06:15:09] AutomatedTester: e.g waiting for the submit button but other than that looks good

[2013-07-17 06:24:25] AutomatedTester: e.g click, send_keys
[2013-07-17 06:24:37] AutomatedTester: we implicitly scroll
[2013-07-17 06:24:41] p_l: AutomatedTester: the problem is that I already had cases where it wouldn't click because element wasn't visible
[2013-07-17 06:24:51] p_l: that is, visible in viewport
[2013-07-17 06:24:58] AutomatedTester: p_l: thats a bug if we arent scrolling
[2013-07-17 06:25:09] AutomatedTester: we should implicitly scroll for you

[2013-07-17 09:34:32] Prometheian: Okay. I tried downgrading my Chrome to v27 to fix an issue, which didn't help, so I was wondering if my v27 was too high.
[2013-07-17 09:34:41] Prometheian: But nope, not it. ^^

[2013-07-17 09:39:36] Dude-X: that's what stable is anyway
[2013-07-17 09:39:41] Dude-X: and it should work well with chromedriver 2

[2013-07-17 09:40:20] barancev: and now I'm back and going to implement Java binding for marionette
[2013-07-17 09:40:45] jleyba: where are we on a 2.34 release/
[2013-07-17 09:40:59] barancev: jimevans: why don't you include C# binding for marionette to the trunk?
[2013-07-17 09:41:19] jimevans: barancev: because it's not in the release channel of firefox yet.
[2013-07-17 09:41:48] jimevans: and i'm not convinced of the right way to do version-specific detection.
[2013-07-17 09:41:53] jimevans: at least not yet.
[2013-07-17 09:41:58] jimevans: i'm still thinking on it.
[2013-07-17 09:42:02] barancev: jleyba: somebody should build native events lib for linux x64 (iirc lukeis created 32 bit version only)
[2013-07-17 09:42:37] barancev: jimevans: MarionetteDriver can be a separate driver (temporarily)
[2013-07-17 09:42:56] barancev: or do you want to make it a capability?
[2013-07-17 09:42:57] jimevans: barancev: i'm not comfortable with that for the .net bindings.
[2013-07-17 09:43:08] barancev: we don't need auto-detection
[2013-07-17 09:43:14] barancev: we Ð²Ñ‰Ñ‚Ð¶Ðµ want it
[2013-07-17 09:43:20] barancev: we don't want it
[2013-07-17 09:43:41] barancev: we should allow the user to choose
[2013-07-17 09:43:52] barancev: at least for several releases
[2013-07-17 09:44:33] sfbrian, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-17 09:44:54] jimevans: barancev: that's fine, as far as it goes. the .net firefox driver needs a little refactoring at this point though, because i hate copy-paste code. and i'm not done with that yet.
[2013-07-17 09:45:17] barancev: fair
[2013-07-17 09:45:23] jimevans: it's not going into 2.34. full stop.
[2013-07-17 09:45:34] jimevans: not in .net, anyway.
[2013-07-17 09:45:35] jimevans: :)
[2013-07-17 09:45:52] barancev: sure I'm not going to include it in 2.34 for Java too
[2013-07-17 09:46:31] jimevans: well, that would be one reason it's not in trunk. :) the .net bindings build process compiles a glob of all .cs files. :)
[2013-07-17 09:46:53] Dude-X: firefox 24 ail have marionette in release build right?
[2013-07-17 09:47:00] barancev: yes

[2013-07-17 09:47:58] barancev: yes, the end of September
[2013-07-17 09:48:38] jleyba: Prometheian what are you trying to do?
[2013-07-17 09:49:02] Prometheian: I keep getting "chrome not reachable" errors in my JUnit test that I'm trying to run on Grid.
[2013-07-17 09:49:39] jleyba: Oh.   I don't use grid so I can't help you there
[2013-07-17 09:49:50] Prometheian: I've set the chromedriver path in my command line setup, I was wondering if I can set the chrome path as well.
[2013-07-17 09:49:58] jleyba: Yes.
[2013-07-17 09:50:01] jleyba: See ChromeOptions class
[2013-07-17 09:50:17] jleyba: Well, you can't set it from the command line, but you can in DesiredCapabilities (see previous comment)
[2013-07-17 09:50:41] gagangowda10: is there a way to tell the webdriver to wait untill an ajax call completes???
[2013-07-17 09:50:58] Dude-X: gagangowda10: use a web driver wait with execute script
[2013-07-17 09:51:46] jleyba: ew.  if you're not expecting any navigation, use executeAsyncScript
[2013-07-17 09:51:58] Dude-X: python example: WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(lambda d: d.execute_script("return jQuery.active === 0;")
[2013-07-17 09:52:22] gagangowda10: Dude-X thats awesome!!! thank you!

[2013-07-17 09:52:33] Prometheian: What's the capability name, chrome.path? I'm lookin through documentation but haven't found yet.
[2013-07-17 09:52:34] jleyba: Still think executeAsyncScript would be better.  See example in javadoc: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/JavascriptExecutor.html#executeAsyncScript(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object...)
[2013-07-17 09:52:35] Dude-X: that's a simple acase
[2013-07-17 09:53:05] Dude-X: jleyba: async script is cool if you know what to hook into
[2013-07-17 09:53:22] jleyba: Prometheian: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/chrome/ChromeOptions.html#setBinary(java.io.File)
[2013-07-17 09:53:37] Prometheian: Ah, ty. ^^
[2013-07-17 09:54:17] jleyba: Dude-X: you can check jQuery.active.  just use setTimeout to recheck if != 0
[2013-07-17 09:55:13] Dude-X: i am a little unclear on how setTimeout works
