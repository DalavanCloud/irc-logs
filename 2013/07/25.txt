[2013-07-25 00:44:51] nicegraham: millenium: you can use the capabilities to achieve that
[2013-07-25 00:45:31] millenium: nicegraham how I can set the ip of the node I'm on .net
[2013-07-25 00:45:58] nicegraham: as in point it at an ip?
[2013-07-25 00:47:34] millenium: I have identical machines in DesiredCapabilities I can set only browser type, browser version, and os type, but they are all the same on my tests :(
[2013-07-25 00:47:55] millenium: the difference is in the websites hosted there
[2013-07-25 00:48:08] nicegraham: you can add a different capability
[2013-07-25 00:48:23] millenium: like?
[2013-07-25 00:48:24] nicegraham: or use one of the existing ones to differentiate
[2013-07-25 00:49:08] millenium: I have two nodes with this params java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.33.0.jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=C:\neoface\SeleniumServer\chromedriver.exe -role webdriver -hub http://192.168.1.57:4444/grid/register -port 5556 -browser "platform=WINDOWS,browserName=chrome,maxInstances=4" -browser  "browserName=firefox,maxInstances=4
[2013-07-25 00:49:49] nicegraham: you can overwrite those capabilities
[2013-07-25 00:50:03] nicegraham: or specify browserVersion
[2013-07-25 00:51:30] nicegraham: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2
[2013-07-25 00:51:40] nicegraham: Parameters allowed for -browser: browserName={android, chrome, firefox, htmlunit, internet explorer, iphone, opera} version={browser version} firefox_binary={path to executable binary} chrome_binary={path to executable binary} maxInstances={maximum number of browsers of this type} platform={WINDOWS, LINUX, MAC}
[2013-07-25 00:52:16] nicegraham: use the version to identify the node or block of nodes you want to use
[2013-07-25 00:53:33] millenium: so I can lie that my firefox is version 3.6 and try to use it with my remote webdriver but I'll use the currently installed browser

[2013-07-25 05:33:14] dave_s: I kinda want to run it on a central server and just click a button for a "build" (we use PHP) and it runs.
[2013-07-25 05:33:30] andreastt: Maybe Jenkins is what you're looking for?
[2013-07-25 05:33:35] dave_s: All the test cases and also the automation test cases.
[2013-07-25 05:33:37] andreastt: It can parse JUnit reports, for example.
[2013-07-25 05:33:48] andreastt: I assume there's something similar that exports to JUnit format for PHP.
[2013-07-25 05:33:58] dave_s: I

[2013-07-25 05:34:36] andreastt: Well Jenkins seems to fit the bill then.
[2013-07-25 05:34:41] dave_s: So I can set it up to run my phpunit and selenium scripts.

[2013-07-25 06:05:47] andreastt: I don't know testng, but this sounds more like a testng related support question than a Selenium one.
[2013-07-25 06:06:22] andreastt: In JUnit the typical approach is to provide a custom TestRunner that you annotate your suite with using @RunWith.
[2013-07-25 06:06:55] JoshHomme: if it's possible to run with jUnit, then i'll try junit but searching the web, everyone seems to talk about testng
[2013-07-25 06:07:52] selenium33, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-07-25 06:08:12] andreastt: JoshHomme: This is what I do: https://gist.github.com/andreastt/6079437
[2013-07-25 06:09:33] andreastt: Then I use @RunWith(ParallelSuite.class) on the @Suite.SuiteClasses({…}) initializer.
[2013-07-25 06:10:09] andreastt: Possibly testng has some more sophisticated way of doing this.
[2013-07-25 06:10:17] andreastt: (But I don't really like testng.)
[2013-07-25 06:11:58] JoshHomme: never used testng before, this was my first try
[2013-07-25 06:12:02] JoshHomme: i'll check it out, thx
[2013-07-25 06:12:24] JoshHomme: so I put @RunWith(ParallelSuite.class) on my @Test ?
[2013-07-25 06:15:35] JoshHomme: what do I do with the @Suite.SuiteClasses({…}) ?
[2013-07-25 06:16:08] andreastt: My implementation of ParallelSuite is designed to be put on your initializer list of test classes, not on the test class directly.
[2013-07-25 06:16:38] JoshHomme: ah, ok
[2013-07-25 06:16:42] andreastt: See for example http://www.mkyong.com/unittest/junit-4-tutorial-5-suite-test/
[2013-07-25 06:17:19] andreastt: So it runs the tests within a class in sequence on a thread, but parallelizes the classes on multiple threads.

[2013-07-25 06:18:57] JoshHomme: is it stanbdard junit?
[2013-07-25 06:19:28] andreastt: Yes, it's in the org.junit.runners package.
[2013-07-25 06:19:34] andreastt: org.junit.runners.Suite to be exact.
[2013-07-25 06:19:51] JoshHomme: i see, eclipse was acting up again :)
[2013-07-25 06:20:01] andreastt: (-:
[2013-07-25 06:20:27] JoshHomme: and where do you define how much instances he can run at the same time?

[2013-07-25 06:25:28] andreastt: JoshHomme: Read the code, it's fetched from the Java system property “testExecutors”.
[2013-07-25 06:25:42] andreastt: But the default is number of CPU cores * 2.
[2013-07-25 06:25:44] JoshHomme: yeah sorry, I just saw it :)
[2013-07-25 06:25:56] andreastt: So 32 on my machine, which is plenty.
[2013-07-25 06:25:58] JoshHomme: but how come that only one FF window is still opened
[2013-07-25 06:26:16] JoshHomme: instead of the number of CPU cores * 2?
[2013-07-25 06:26:57] andreastt: Is this within the same class?  The code I just shared only parallelizes classes, not methods.
[2013-07-25 06:27:10] JoshHomme: yes, it's one test in one class
[2013-07-25 06:27:41] JoshHomme: is there a way to parallelize methods?
[2013-07-25 06:27:46] andreastt: Possibly.
[2013-07-25 06:27:55] andreastt: I mean, most likely.
[2013-07-25 06:27:59] JoshHomme: :)
[2013-07-25 06:28:07] andreastt: But bear in mind that starting browser instances is very expensive.
[2013-07-25 06:28:26] andreastt: So unless you have Google scale you should keep them longer than one test.
[2013-07-25 06:28:43] JoshHomme: true, but we are using vaadin and I am not sure that HtmlUnit supports vaadin
[2013-07-25 06:29:17] andreastt: So if you were to start a fresh browser session in each test method AND to parallelization of methods, it could quite possibly be slower than running all method sin sequence on one instance.
[2013-07-25 06:29:38] JoshHomme: well the goal is to load test using webdriver
[2013-07-25 06:29:49] JoshHomme: so if the tests run slow that's not a big of a deal
[2013-07-25 06:30:00] JoshHomme: as long as they put the system under load it's fine
[2013-07-25 06:30:02] andreastt: webdriver is a really poor tool for doing load testing (-:
[2013-07-25 06:30:14] JoshHomme: any other suggestions are welcome :)
[2013-07-25 06:30:22] JoshHomme: but not many tools can load test vaadin

[2013-07-25 11:59:37] phasze: I'm trying to setup a timeout thing for these nodes, so if some test happens to never end (eg. enters a filepath that doesn't exist).  Is there a timeout thing I can set so it does that cleanup/releases the node in grid?
[2013-07-25 11:59:43] phasze: such as timeout or browserTimeout
[2013-07-25 12:00:00] phasze: I've been trying to play with those two but haven't had much success
[2013-07-25 12:01:08] dimacus: hmmm
[2013-07-25 12:01:16] asavchuk: phasze: yes, there is. see commit 0acce3ba7ebcbc399ac7c9e38311390e0f7e6cfd

[2013-07-25 12:01:29] asavchuk: but it will be available only for 2.34
[2013-07-25 12:01:38] phasze: ah
[2013-07-25 12:02:15] asavchuk: for 2.33 only nodePolling and unregisterIfStillDown are available

[2013-07-25 12:02:49] dimacus: asavchuk:  can you expand on "unregisterIfStillDown"?
[2013-07-25 12:02:54] phasze: ^
[2013-07-25 12:02:56] asavchuk: nodePolling defines interval in ms b/w checks of node is alive
[2013-07-25 12:03:11] dimacus: b/c i'm trying to find a away to reboot a node… without hub sending new session to that node
[2013-07-25 12:03:14] dimacus: ie take it offline right away
[2013-07-25 12:03:29] dimacus: so if i do nodePolling every 1 second
[2013-07-25 12:03:38] dimacus: and tell it to unregister… that might solve my issue
[2013-07-25 12:04:09] asavchuk: after 2 tries of node check it marked as down and after unregisterIfStillDow interal in ms it become unregistered
[2013-07-25 12:04:56] dimacus: love it, thank you!
[2013-07-25 12:04:58] phasze: so in 2.34 if the hub registered a failure from the node but the node is still running something on the browser it will run the cleanup on that browser?
[2013-07-25 12:05:32] dimacus: phasze:  i think i'll add that the nodepolling and unregister to default configs to pass to node/hub in extras
[2013-07-25 12:05:40] asavchuk: dimacus: phasze stop. this mechnizm is alrady existed.
[2013-07-25 12:05:51] asavchuk: i only to improve it :)

[2013-07-25 12:06:11] phasze: asavchuk: how do I use this already existing mechanism?
[2013-07-25 12:06:14] dimacus: just making it it on by default
[2013-07-25 12:07:10] asavchuk: phasze: set up parameters nodePolling and unregisterIfStillDown to something 1000 and 1000.
[2013-07-25 12:07:38] phasze: but I don't want it to unregister
[2013-07-25 12:07:49] phasze: I just want it to clean up the bloody browser that got left open
[2013-07-25 12:08:13] dimacus: phasze:  then why don't you call the /kill_ie or /kill_chrome on extras?
[2013-07-25 12:08:13] rakl, quitting. (Quit: sleeping)
[2013-07-25 12:08:25] phasze: that's what I'm trying to do
[2013-07-25 12:08:28] phasze: but I'm not sure what node
[2013-07-25 12:09:05] phasze: the failure is returned to the hub and it doesn't contain any session/node data
[2013-07-25 12:09:06] dimacus: ahh… so what about the proxy that we have with extras?
[2013-07-25 12:09:07] dimacus: there is an "after session" call
[2013-07-25 12:09:15] asavchuk: phasze: if there is no session for this browser, use /kill_ie way. selenium can do nothing for such situation
[2013-07-25 12:09:15] phasze: yeah, but the session isn't over
[2013-07-25 12:09:23] asavchuk: oh
[2013-07-25 12:09:35] dimacus: oh...
[2013-07-25 12:09:38] dimacus: ok so you have 3 tests
[2013-07-25 12:09:38] phasze: the session is still alive but the failure has already been reported to the hub
[2013-07-25 12:09:43] dimacus: test 1 gets stuck...
[2013-07-25 12:09:46] phasze: yup
[2013-07-25 12:09:49] dimacus: kill session, start new session for test 2
[2013-07-25 12:09:55] dimacus: probably the sanest solution
[2013-07-25 12:10:02] asavchuk: here is another clean exist - for timed out sessions
[2013-07-25 12:10:04] phasze: dunno how to kill that session
[2013-07-25 12:10:22] dimacus: driver.quit
[2013-07-25 12:10:27] phasze: never gets hit
[2013-07-25 12:11:12] phasze: because the test is still running
[2013-07-25 12:11:12] dimacus: actually, how about setting a timeout for sessions pretty low, if node is stuck… your tests can request a new node, and this node will hit idle timeout and kill current session?
[2013-07-25 12:11:25] phasze: that's what I'm trying to do
[2013-07-25 12:11:32] phasze: if a test is idle for too long I want it killed
[2013-07-25 12:12:12] Prometheian: lol
[2013-07-25 12:12:39] phasze: I think it's NUnit that returns the failure
[2013-07-25 12:12:45] phasze: but the session is still alive on grid
[2013-07-25 12:12:50] dimacus: phasze:  -browserTimeout
[2013-07-25 12:13:00] asavchuk: phasze: see at cleanUpCycle timeout
[2013-07-25 12:13:05] AutomatedTester: barancev: yup
[2013-07-25 12:13:08] AutomatedTester: well now
[2013-07-25 12:13:18] dimacus: asavchuk:  +1
[2013-07-25 12:13:25] phasze: these are in ms?
[2013-07-25 12:13:26] barancev: AutomatedTester: already resolved my trouble :)
[2013-07-25 12:13:34] AutomatedTester: barancev: hurray
[2013-07-25 12:13:38] asavchuk: phasze: cleanUpCycle and timeout.
[2013-07-25 12:13:58] phasze: looks like cleanUpCycle is already at 5000
[2013-07-25 12:14:16] phasze: is that in seconds?
[2013-07-25 12:14:31] dimacus: no it's ms
[2013-07-25 12:14:33] phasze: 5 ms sounds kinda small
[2013-07-25 12:14:36] phasze: errr 5 s
[2013-07-25 12:14:37] phasze: hehe
[2013-07-25 12:15:09] dimacus: well if you set -browserTimeout to 60
[2013-07-25 12:15:30] dimacus: after page hangs for 60 seconds, it's in timeout, then every 5 seconds cleanupCycle will check it and say clean it up
[2013-07-25 12:15:34] phasze: so does that mean if no command is sent within 60 seconds it will clean up that session?
[2013-07-25 12:15:37] dimacus: asavchuk:  is my understanding corret?
[2013-07-25 12:16:22] dimacus: actually -nodeTimeout is timeout that says if node does not get any new commands, to clean it up
[2013-07-25 12:16:35] *dimacus surprissed at all the timeouts'
[2013-07-25 12:16:44] phasze: I'll brb, my specific example is with sending keys to an input field for a file upload and not giving a valid path in IE, it never exits
[2013-07-25 12:17:26] dimacus: ok so are you talaking about command timeout then?
[2013-07-25 12:17:42] dimacus: ie… you send a click command, and it just sits there waiting for new page to open?
[2013-07-25 12:17:53] asavchuk: dimacus: looks correct. but i'm not expert of grid2 :)

[2013-07-25 12:29:14] phasze: oh I'm sure it is, but shouldn't there be a way to have grid clean things up (delete sessions) if they're not used for a certain amount of time?

[2013-07-25 12:30:55] phasze: maybe I just need to lower the "timeout" value to something below the .Net timeout in Nunit
[2013-07-25 12:31:03] dimacus: phasze:  i think you should do it maybe in teardown for that test?
[2013-07-25 12:31:17] phasze: problem is the teardown is never hit

[2013-07-25 12:37:29] dimacus: in a good language like ruby, you could monkey patch the existing upload method to throw an exception… and all of them would just buble up and prevent users from using the old way again ;)

[2013-07-25 13:14:48] phasze: kk, letting it try and quit now
[2013-07-25 13:16:29] phasze: it executed driver.Quit() but nothing was written to the log and the window was not closed, the session is still alive
[2013-07-25 13:17:29] phasze: maybe because of the exception thrown by the sendkeys with the http request to session timing out
[2013-07-25 13:17:43] phasze: I'll throw that in a try/catch and see if the quit records anything then

[2013-07-25 13:42:51] kallisti: currently I actually don't expose any access to the capabilities JSON object.

[2013-07-25 13:43:44] kallisti: for non-standard capabilities
[2013-07-25 13:44:12] jimevans: for what .NET does, each Options class has a catchall AddAdditionalCapability method for that case.
[2013-07-25 13:44:44] jimevans: (which, incidentally, checks for known capabilities when you try to add a "known" capabilty there)
[2013-07-25 13:44:56] kallisti: yeah I could just have an additionalCapabilities field which contains a list of pairs.
[2013-07-25 13:45:44] kallisti: checking for known capabilities would be a little weird.
[2013-07-25 13:45:48] kallisti: but possible.

[2013-07-25 13:46:33] jimevans: well, the point being i don't want someone doing options.AddAdditionalCapability("nativeEvents", false) if there's already an EnableNativeEvents property on the options object they should be using instead.

[2013-07-25 13:47:15] kallisti: jimevans: what do you do in that case?
[2013-07-25 13:47:31] jimevans: throw an exception.
[2013-07-25 13:47:43] kallisti: jimevans: I'm assuming there's an options object for every browser or something like that?
[2013-07-25 13:47:48] jimevans: the "don't do that moron" exception
[2013-07-25 13:47:59] jimevans: for IE, Chrome, and PhantomJS, yes.
[2013-07-25 13:48:12] jimevans: firefox, not yet, because that's a bit of a refactor for me.
[2013-07-25 13:48:19] kallisti: oh, webdriver supports phantomjs?
[2013-07-25 13:48:38] jimevans: and the constructors for each of those drivers takes the appropriate options class instead of raw capabilities.
[2013-07-25 13:48:47] kallisti: right
[2013-07-25 13:48:50] jimevans: phantomjs has webdriver support baked in.\
[2013-07-25 13:49:14] kallisti: oh okay. Are there any phantomjs-specific capabilities?
[2013-07-25 13:49:39] jimevans: so the .NET PhantomJSDriver is a convenience class; you could use RemoteWebDriver just as easily.
[2013-07-25 13:49:43] kallisti: ah okay.
[2013-07-25 13:50:56] kallisti: So I don't need to worry about it. It wouldn't make any sense for me to do that over in not-object-oriented land.
[2013-07-25 13:52:04] kallisti: eventually I'll probably want additionalDesiredCapabilities and additionalRequiredCapabilities, but I haven't implemented that stuff yet.
[2013-07-25 13:53:36] asavchuk: jimevans: It looks like really old behaviour. I'd like to change it to something reasonable like 1-10 seconds if you have no objections.
[2013-07-25 13:53:47] kallisti: jimevans: I guess I could add a phantomJS browser capability though. Or does it just ignore the browser capability?
[2013-07-25 13:54:19] kallisti: {browser: "phantomjs", ...}  or something?

[2013-07-25 14:08:43] cgoldberg: Dude-X_, erlang is prob perfect for a huge grid
[2013-07-25 14:08:54] Dude-X_: yeah but haskell feels like you have to be a math genius to get it right
[2013-07-25 14:08:55] barancev: a command like option may be?
[2013-07-25 14:08:58] cgoldberg: Dude-X_, yes, and has been for a while now
[2013-07-25 14:09:17] andreastt: Dude-X_: There is already a WebDriver client in Go.
[2013-07-25 14:09:27] andreastt: And Go is, by the way, an awesome language.
[2013-07-25 14:09:33] andreastt: barancev: You can make the same call on OperaProfile.
[2013-07-25 14:09:38] cgoldberg: haha.. i've actually used.  (damn my memory is bad)
[2013-07-25 14:09:48] barancev: andreastt: from javascript code?
[2013-07-25 14:10:06] andreastt: No probably not.  It's a privileged call.
[2013-07-25 14:10:12] andreastt: barancev: Are these atoms tests?
[2013-07-25 14:10:18] kallisti: Dude-X_: depends on what you're doing.
[2013-07-25 14:10:37] barancev: andreastt: yes. http://ci.seleniumhq.org:2310/javascript/atoms/test/html5/location_test.html
[2013-07-25 14:10:57] andreastt: I'd be happy with adding this call to the WebDriverBuilder.
[2013-07-25 14:11:10] andreastt: Adding it to the test runner would fix it, even for atoms tests, right?
[2013-07-25 14:11:41] cgoldberg: Dude-X_, we are hardcore python... but certain programs don't make sense to run in Python, so embracing Go a lot instead of just Python or C
[2013-07-25 14:12:07] barancev: andreastt: on CI, yes, I should try, thanks!
[2013-07-25 14:12:15] Dude-X_: i guess Go would be good if you want an easier C to write for Speed, and better concurrnecy support than Python
[2013-07-25 14:12:20] andreastt: barancev: Thanks for looking into it (-:
[2013-07-25 14:12:53] andreastt: Dude-X_: https://bitbucket.org/tebeka/selenium
[2013-07-25 14:13:08] andreastt: cgoldberg: Many things don't make sense to write in Python.
[2013-07-25 14:13:27] kallisti: Dude-X_: the main thing haskell lacks that erlang has is the built-in support for distributed programs. The concurrency support is on par with erlang and go.
[2013-07-25 14:13:30] andreastt: But ctypes is pretty awesome, and integrates well with Go programs AFAIK.
[2013-07-25 14:13:38] Dude-X_: thanks andreastt
[2013-07-25 14:13:52] Dude-X_: i think the latest thing in python is to use cffi
[2013-07-25 14:13:54] cgoldberg: Dude-X_, C speed, Python ease, awesome concurrency... or so th pitch goes.  I've only really toyed with Go and written some trivial programs... but I've seen some neat stuff done in it by others.
[2013-07-25 14:13:55] Dude-X_: better than ctypes
[2013-07-25 14:14:18] andreastt: Ah, I see.  I'll look it up.
[2013-07-25 14:14:47] Dude-X_: i have to wrap my mind on how would i write go programs without the object model... but i think it's the same case as in C
[2013-07-25 14:15:02] andreastt: I feel the same here.
[2013-07-25 14:15:16] Dude-X_: cffi also gives you the benefit to run a python C extension in PyPy as well
[2013-07-25 14:15:56] andreastt: Also I'm not too impressed by Go's testing features.  I also have a slight dislike of the strictness of its package solutions.
[2013-07-25 14:15:59] kallisti: Dude-X_: objects are just structs/records/etc with a builtin namespace for functions that have an implicit argument. And that whole inheritance thing, but who needs that.
[2013-07-25 14:16:11] Dude-X_: go takes advantage of inheritance!
[2013-07-25 14:16:15] Dude-X_: err
[2013-07-25 14:16:16] Dude-X_: nevermind
[2013-07-25 14:16:17] Dude-X_: interfaces
[2013-07-25 14:16:22] andreastt: Not doing inheritence is a feature IMO.

[2013-07-25 14:58:35] timbo1: but since 2.33 + the console UI change
[2013-07-25 14:58:52] timbo1: once I add the android node, the console UI will give me 500 response with that error org.json.JSONObject$Null cannot be cast to java.lang.String

[2013-07-25 15:13:57] asavchuk: which text is shown ?
[2013-07-25 15:14:17] asavchuk: as i understand it's the reason of 500.

[2013-07-25 15:18:10] timbo1: well

[2013-07-25 15:18:25] asavchuk: looks like it registers aan another hub inside

[2013-07-25 16:10:36] detronizator: what's up
[2013-07-25 16:10:41] detronizator: yes
[2013-07-25 16:10:49] detronizator: well
[2013-07-25 16:11:01] detronizator: IF you are using GhostDriver from a local copy of the JS source, yes
[2013-07-25 16:11:03] detronizator: otherwise, no
[2013-07-25 16:11:26] jimevans: okay, so what's the order.
[2013-07-25 16:11:44] detronizator: IF you are using GhostDriver from local source, anything before `src/main.js` is paramter for PhantomJS - anything after is parameters for GhostDriver
[2013-07-25 16:11:52] detronizator: this is a general rule in PhantomJS
[2013-07-25 16:12:07] detronizator: this way you can pass cli parameters to your phantomjs script
[2013-07-25 16:12:07] jimevans: okay. i need to adjust the .net bindings then.

[2013-07-25 16:12:27] jleyba: detronizator: is it ok to run phantoms as a long running webdriver server with multiple sessions, or is it assumed you'll launch a new process for each session?
[2013-07-25 16:12:30] detronizator: we should probably document that better in phantomjs --help
[2013-07-25 16:12:37] jimevans: they couldn't call a "development" version of ghostdriver.
[2013-07-25 16:12:44] jimevans: until recently

[2013-07-25 16:13:00] detronizator: jleyba: well, GhostDriver is designed for multi session
[2013-07-25 16:13:07] detronizator: BUT phantomjs webserver is utter crap
[2013-07-25 16:13:14] detronizator: and it crashes randomly after a while
[2013-07-25 16:13:22] detronizator: so I advice to use a new process every time... for now
[2013-07-25 16:13:31] tobie, quitting. (Quit: tobie)
[2013-07-25 16:13:34] jleyba: new process every time, or use GhostDriver?
[2013-07-25 16:14:01] detronizator: if you use the PhantomJSDriver bindings in java (and I guess in all other languages) you get a new process for every sesison
[2013-07-25 16:14:05] detronizator: also, there is another limitation

[2013-07-25 16:14:15] detronizator: sessions within the same process share the same cookiejar
[2013-07-25 16:14:29] detronizator: that has consequences on the "logged on the page" status
[2013-07-25 16:14:31] detronizator: as you can imagine
[2013-07-25 16:14:39] jleyba: ah that's a deal breaker for me
[2013-07-25 16:15:07] jleyba: is other state shared?  cache, local/session storage, etc?
[2013-07-25 16:15:41] detronizator: yep - you are in 1 browser opening multiple tabs
[2013-07-25 16:16:09] detronizator: it's in the pipeline to use multiple processes of phantomjs, so that this isolation is a given
[2013-07-25 16:16:24] detronizator: hopefully after 1.0.4 I can go back to actual features
[2013-07-25 16:16:27] detronizator: instead of bug fixes
[2013-07-25 16:16:40] detronizator: tomorrow I need to import 1.0.4 bindings into Selenium repo
[2013-07-25 16:16:51] detronizator: and give another go at running the full suite test again
[2013-07-25 16:16:59] detronizator: last time I was doing steady progress there
[2013-07-25 16:17:10] detronizator: I managed to make more tests of the Selenium suite pass
