[2013-07-21 15:05:15] Dude-X_: smccarthy: it all depends on what you're trying to extract; there are many strategies that can be used. you can be lazy and do findElements, and iterate through the list of elements, or you can use some xpath and narrow it down a specific row
[2013-07-21 15:05:28] Dude-X_: smccarthy: also depends on how fast you want your tests to be
[2013-07-21 15:06:05] smccarthy: Dude-X_: I dont need to iterate through the list of elements right? Since I can grab it by the index.

[2013-07-21 15:06:52] Dude-X_: if you can narrow it down easily, grab it by index, otherwise it might be easier to just grab everything and look for what you want.
