[2013-07-02 13:36:47] AutomatedTester: lukeis: it will be something like [[chain1], [chain2], [chain3]]
[2013-07-02 13:37:08] AutomatedTester: lukeis: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/marionette/client/marionette/marionette.py#104
[2013-07-02 13:37:20] AutomatedTester: thats the actions and multi actions is below that
[2013-07-02 13:37:43] AutomatedTester: lukeis: I am also updating Malini's document
[2013-07-02 13:37:54] lukeis: ok :)
[2013-07-02 13:40:10] AutomatedTester: [[item1, item2, item3], [item1, item2, item3], [item1, item2, item3]] turns into [item1, item1, item1], [item2, item2, item2], [item3, item3, item3] when executed
[2013-07-02 13:40:14] AutomatedTester: lukeis: ^
[2013-07-02 13:40:53] lukeis: yeah, i think I caught that by what the spec implied
[2013-07-02 13:41:13] lukeis: how exactly item1 looks is more my question :)
[2013-07-02 13:41:42] AutomatedTester: lukeis: item1 can be any action
[2013-07-02 13:41:47] AutomatedTester: e.g. click, send_keys etc
[2013-07-02 13:42:09] lukeis: yes, but where do the keys go for sendkeys
[2013-07-02 13:42:15] lukeis: is it a complex object?
[2013-07-02 13:42:25] AutomatedTester: [[chain1], [chain2], [chain3]] === [[item1, item2, item3], [item1, item2, item3], [item1, item2, item3]]
[2013-07-02 13:42:25] lukeis: how is it detailed? :)
[2013-07-02 13:43:09] lukeis: .send_keys("some keys")  <- where does "some keys" fit in
[2013-07-02 13:43:27] AutomatedTester: in the same way an action does it
[2013-07-02 13:43:29] lukeis: "send_keys('some keys')"  is   itemX,  right?
[2013-07-02 13:43:38] AutomatedTester: yes
[2013-07-02 13:43:48] lukeis: but action does it as a JSON payload
[2013-07-02 13:43:57] lukeis: to an action endpoint
[2013-07-02 13:43:57] jimevans: lukeis: item1 would probably look something like {"name": "moveto", "element": "element-webdriver-id", "xoffset": 5, "yoffset": 5}
[2013-07-02 13:44:19] jimevans: the difference here is that there would be one (and only one) "action endpoint"
[2013-07-02 13:44:24] lukeis: jimevans:  that's what i'm getting atâ€¦ exactly what that is supposed to look like ;)
[2013-07-02 13:45:26] AutomatedTester: lukeis: dont go on our implementation as our JSON payload is a little out
[2013-07-02 13:48:54] jimevans: i particulars haven't been exactly defined yet, but i'd expect a single chain to look something like this: https://gist.github.com/jimevans/5912957

[2013-07-02 13:49:24] jimevans: and so multiple actions might look something like this:

[2013-07-02 13:52:36] AutomatedTester: jimevans: thats pretty much it
[2013-07-02 13:53:26] AutomatedTester: the important part is that each action is just an array of atomic tasks
[2013-07-02 13:53:44] brettporter, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-02 13:54:37] AutomatedTester: and then multi actions is just an array of actions
[2013-07-02 13:54:59] jimevans: yep. something like this: https://gist.github.com/jimevans/5913025
[2013-07-02 13:55:13] jimevans: note the addition of the synchronizing "wait" action.
[2013-07-02 13:55:57] jimevans: that would be an approximation of a "pinch"
[2013-07-02 13:56:05] jimevans: sorta-kinda
[2013-07-02 13:56:37] jimevans: the implementation details may not be exactly that, but that should give you the gist of it.
[2013-07-02 13:57:46] AutomatedTester: jimevans: lukeis: https://gist.github.com/AutomatedTester/5750415 is a working example of pinch

[2013-07-02 14:06:15] AutomatedTester: lukeis: a wait is a synchronising command
[2013-07-02 14:08:02] lukeis: yes, but a pinch seems like it would be better as   action1 = Action().press(location1).move_to(location2, duration=1500).release().perform();  action2 = (basically the same as the other one) and then perform both
[2013-07-02 14:09:12] AutomatedTester: we might do that
[2013-07-02 14:09:26] AutomatedTester: but in this case we are doing move, pause, move, pause
[2013-07-02 14:09:40] AutomatedTester: makes verbose chains but simplifies things
[2013-07-02 14:10:52] lukeis: the odd thing is that ios-driver / appium  would need to translate that whole chain to understand it and then issue the one Instrumentation command to perform the action
[2013-07-02 14:11:01] jleyba: Action().press(location).move_by_offset(dx, dy, velocity.pixels_per_second(20)).release().perform()
[2013-07-02 14:11:04] lukeis: (especially with pinch)
[2013-07-02 14:11:21] lukeis: yeah, i like that too jleyba
[2013-07-02 14:11:29] *jleyba has never used the interactions api in a meaningful way, just throwing stuff out there'
[2013-07-02 14:11:37] lukeis: velocity can be inferred by duration though
[2013-07-02 14:11:51] AutomatedTester: pixel_per_second is going to cause issue
[2013-07-02 14:12:05] AutomatedTester: since each device have different densities
[2013-07-02 14:12:12] jimevans: lukeis: does instrumentation consider "pinch" one gesture?
[2013-07-02 14:12:20] lukeis: yes
[2013-07-02 14:12:27] jimevans: (i.e., it has one command for it)
[2013-07-02 14:12:31] lukeis: yes
[2013-07-02 14:12:32] jleyba: AutomatedTester: android emulator can be configured for that.  some devs care
[2013-07-02 14:12:51] AutomatedTester: jleyba: they care enough to make you use the emulator
[2013-07-02 14:13:02] AutomatedTester: :)
[2013-07-02 14:13:26] jimevans: that's fine, but we're thinking bigger than that. consider automating an MSFT surface table, which could conceivably have far more than two things making contact at once.
[2013-07-02 14:13:27] jleyba: the emulator scales a hell of a lot better than device labs
[2013-07-02 14:14:24] AutomatedTester: jleyba: there is that
[2013-07-02 14:14:27] jimevans: suddenly pinch (with only two fingers) is very limiting. yes it works for phones/today's tablets, but there may be a time when we need more than that.
[2013-07-02 14:14:48] lukeis: jimevans: yeah, i'm ok with having ios translate something like I mentioned into one 'pinch' commandâ€¦ but the waits like AutomatedTester showed are a bit much to translate
[2013-07-02 14:15:06] dimacus, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-07-02 14:15:14] jleyba: Should we support more abstract action APIs?
[2013-07-02 14:15:23] sowat, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-02 14:15:30] jleyba: for example: Actions().dragFrom(el1).to(el2).perform()
[2013-07-02 14:15:30] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-02 14:15:31] *lukeis thinks so'
[2013-07-02 14:16:09] AutomatedTester: lukeis: how do you perform taps with 2 fingers where the fingers are not in sync?
[2013-07-02 14:16:18] sowat: I am not able to execute javascript with webdriver in the latest version of firefox. I get "waiting for evaluate.js load failed" regardless
[2013-07-02 14:16:23] jimevans: jleyba: good question.
[2013-07-02 14:17:24] lukeis: AutomatedTester: I think having the wait / having that minutia is good, just that common use case for end users automating apps (rather than the browser/os itself) isn't going to use it
[2013-07-02 14:17:37] rickdarcy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-02 14:18:01] AutomatedTester: lukeis: I freely admit there might be a disconnect there
[2013-07-02 14:19:43] AutomatedTester: lukeis: our "worst" case was making sure that we can testing games
[2013-07-02 14:20:01] lukeis: heh ;)
[2013-07-02 14:20:11] jleyba: AutomatedTester: that's crazy ambitious
[2013-07-02 14:20:20] jimevans: we're nothing if not that. :)
[2013-07-02 14:20:33] jimevans: crazy or ambitious. pick one.
[2013-07-02 14:20:56] AutomatedTester: jleyba: actually its not hard
[2013-07-02 14:21:01] jleyba: Every time I ask someone from the game industry what they use for e2e automation they just look at me like i'm a crazy fool
[2013-07-02 14:21:14] jimevans: i think you have to be a little bit crazy to work on a w3c spec.
[2013-07-02 14:21:28] AutomatedTester: jleyba: 2 fingers working asynchronously is how we came about with multi-actions
[2013-07-02 14:21:57] AutomatedTester: think Garage Band
[2013-07-02 14:22:09] AutomatedTester: or is it RockStar
[2013-07-02 14:22:16] AutomatedTester: the guitar game
[2013-07-02 14:22:23] jimevans: guitar hero?
[2013-07-02 14:22:26] jimevans: rock band?
[2013-07-02 14:22:31] AutomatedTester: yea
[2013-07-02 14:22:34] lukeis: ha
[2013-07-02 14:23:30] *lukeis doesn't play any phone games that require me to use more than one fingerâ€¦ since it's often too hard to do so while on the train holding on with one hand ;)'
[2013-07-02 14:24:00] AutomatedTester: also if you want to test rotate on Google Maps
[2013-07-02 14:24:12] AutomatedTester: fingers need to work independantly
[2013-07-02 14:24:21] lukeis: yep

[2013-07-02 14:26:58] jimevans: and to be fair, we may never see such an implementation, but it's nice to know we have that club in our bag.
[2013-07-02 14:27:36] AutomatedTester: yea, the implementation is simple
[2013-07-02 14:27:40] AutomatedTester: "simple" I mean

[2013-07-02 14:39:27] selbot2_: asavchuk: note from jimevans 1 day ago: ping me next time we're both in the channel together. we need to rethink a couple of IE things.
[2013-07-02 14:40:00] asavchuk: :log
[2013-07-02 14:40:00] selbot2_: https://raw.github.com/SeleniumHQ/irc-logs/master/2013/07/02.txt
[2013-07-02 14:41:49] asavchuk: hi everyone!
[2013-07-02 14:41:55] asavchuk: jimevans: ping
[2013-07-02 14:41:56] jimevans: ohai asavchuk!
[2013-07-02 14:42:45] jimevans: so i was thinking about the work we did to get the "forceCreateProcess" and "ieSwitches" command line parameters in the IEDriverServer.
[2013-07-02 14:43:20] jimevans: and i've come back to the notion that those should be desired capabilities on the session, rather than global for the IEDriverServer instance.
[2013-07-02 14:43:44] jimevans: i know i probably argued it exactly the opposite way when we were implementing it the first time, but i think i was wrong.
[2013-07-02 14:43:54] jleyba: jimevans: what if someone wants to reuse the server between sessions?
[2013-07-02 14:44:21] jimevans: jleyba: they should be able to specify this stuff on a per-session basis.
[2013-07-02 14:45:46] jimevans: for instance, when you tell chromedriver that you want to use command-line switches to start chrome, you do that by passing a capability, not a command line arg for chromedriver.exe.
[2013-07-02 14:46:13] ddary, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-07-02 14:46:27] jleyba: oh sorry, i got confused
[2013-07-02 14:46:28] asavchuk: yes, i thought about similar thing when see how switches are passed to chrome. these 2 can be moved to capabilities, i agree
[2013-07-02 14:46:45] jleyba: thought you were talking about flags for the iedriverserver itself, not stuff that configures IE
[2013-07-02 14:47:17] jimevans: asavchuk: you're the only person i know of that uses those things, so i thought i'd run it by you before i unilaterally changed it.
[2013-07-02 14:47:18] jimevans: :)
[2013-07-02 14:48:01] jimevans: jleyba: yeah, some IE configuration things were implemented as IEDriverServer command line args, which is what i'm arguing is incorrect.
[2013-07-02 14:49:09] jimevans: asavchuk: i'll be sure to flag you when i get around to migrating that.
[2013-07-02 14:49:20] jimevans: but for now, friends, i must away!
[2013-07-02 14:49:20] asavchuk: :) yes. maybe i'll do it ? also i wanted to fix requiring TabProcGrowth (if it's event possible).
[2013-07-02 14:49:36] jimevans: "requiring"? for everyone?
[2013-07-02 14:50:44] asavchuk: using forceCreateProcess requires this registry key, as i know. i think it's possible to remove this req.
[2013-07-02 14:51:06] jimevans: asavchuk: you think it's not required to use the registry key?
[2013-07-02 14:51:51] asavchuk: yes, if some additional code will be changed,
[2013-07-02 14:52:01] jimevans: how would that work, exactly?
[2013-07-02 14:52:06] wolcanus, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-07-02 14:57:19] asavchuk: i suppose requirement of TabProcGrowth=0 could be avoided by updating of method which find newly opened window. i think, it would be better, if i create a patch and will show.
[2013-07-02 14:57:46] asavchuk: lets discuss it after that.
[2013-07-02 14:58:10] jimevans: fair enough. i think you're going to hit a race condition, but i'll look at your patch when it's ready.
[2013-07-02 14:58:13] jimevans: for now,
