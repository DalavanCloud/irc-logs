[2013-07-03 07:25:16] Ardesco: not sure
[2013-07-03 07:25:31] AutomatedTester: because its rubbish...

[2013-07-03 07:26:19] AutomatedTester: well git bisect reset MUST put it back to the original state
[2013-07-03 07:26:22] AutomatedTester: imho
[2013-07-03 07:26:26] Ardesco: from what i've seen and used it's insanely powerful but gives you the tools to really mess yourself up
[2013-07-03 07:26:40] Ardesco: if you aren't totally sure what you are doing
[2013-07-03 07:27:03] Ardesco: did you do a git bisect reset HEAD

[2013-07-03 08:36:07] __gotcha: and I log jquery eventdata

[2013-07-03 08:38:07] Dude-X: native events is where the OS uses the mouse to click/drag,move
[2013-07-03 08:38:20] Dude-X: otherwise Webdriver will make javascript calls
[2013-07-03 08:38:35] __gotcha: Dude-X: testing with firefox on osx

[2013-07-03 08:40:10] jimevans: __gotcha: it's simple. linux and windows support native events, os x doesn't. on windows, it's enabled by default; on linux, you have to specifically enable it.

[2013-07-03 08:42:48] jimevans: turn it on in the firefox profile. that is, you need to create a FirefoxProfile object, enable the native events therein, and pass it to your FirefoxDriver constructor.
[2013-07-03 08:43:09] Dude-X: you may have to do: from selenium.webdriver.firefox import FirefoxProfile

[2013-07-03 10:39:33] jimevans: there's a special "mvp summit" conference that happens that i'll get to go to.
[2013-07-03 10:39:51] jimevans: just the opposite. you *can't* work at MSFT and be an mvp.
[2013-07-03 10:39:59] jimevans: employees aren't eligible.
[2013-07-03 10:40:29] dimacus: ah cool… i don't think i'll ever get one, b/c my twitter stream is non stop bitching about the msft… :-P
[2013-07-03 10:41:13] jimevans: dimacus: there's a nomination process. someone just has to nominate you (RossPatterson nominated me), and you can nominate yourself.
[2013-07-03 10:41:39] dimacus: oh cool
[2013-07-03 10:41:39] jimevans: but then they send you a questionnaire that asks basically, "what have you done for the microsoft platform this year"
[2013-07-03 10:41:49] dimacus: i'll keep that in mind to nominate you again next year ;)

[2013-07-03 13:18:56] jimevans: hirani: most of the other language bindings have a concept of an "explicit wait", usually implemented with an object called WebDriverWait or similar. it takes a condition and polls for the condition to be true or a timeout to be reached.
[2013-07-03 13:19:20] jimevans: since the perl bindings aren't provided by the Selenium project, i can't speak as to whether they include such a construct.

[2013-07-03 13:20:25] jimevans: nevertheless, that's the "correct" solution. check for the condition (is an alert present) to be true. if not, wait for a short amount of time, and check again. keep checking until the condition is true or your timeout is reached.
[2013-07-03 13:21:22] simonstewart: There's an ExpectedCondition for that

[2013-07-03 13:46:08] gdennis: barancev: makes sense from WebDriver's perspective. The driver can take care of that when invoking the JavaScript, just provide window.top for the second argument

[2013-07-03 13:46:34] Ubuh-Huntuh: selenium only works with firefox right?
[2013-07-03 13:47:16] jimevans: Ubuh-Huntuh: no. selenium works with most browser. selenium *IDE* only works in firefox.
[2013-07-03 13:47:17] barancev: gdennis: yes, I see, we have to add a wrapper around setSize
[2013-07-03 13:47:44] Ubuh-Huntuh: jimevans: meaning i can only record test cases with Firefox? but the script can call any browser?
[2013-07-03 13:48:21] gdennis: jimevans: how often in the IE driver do you find yourself taking more JS roundtrips than ideally necessary, if there were only a JS function that did X, Y, and Z for you all at once?
[2013-07-03 13:48:26] jimevans: Ubuh-Huntuh: not exactly. yes, you can only record test cases in firefox. if you're using IDE to play them back, that will likewise only work in firefox.
[2013-07-03 13:49:14] jimevans: Ubuh-Huntuh: but it's possible to export IDE scripts to a "real" programming language, which can then use any supported browser for the script.
[2013-07-03 13:49:36] jimevans: gdennis: far more often than i'd like to admit.
[2013-07-03 13:50:13] jimevans: actually, it happens every time we run any javascript.
[2013-07-03 13:50:39] jimevans: sorry. not what i meant to say.
[2013-07-03 13:50:56] jimevans: but it does happen anytime we find an element. that takes two javascript round-trips.
[2013-07-03 13:51:16] davidlai, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-03 13:51:32] jimevans: because the findElement atom takes a json object, which irks me, but that's the api, so i deal with it.
[2013-07-03 13:51:32] gdennis: jimevans: we can pretty easily create a set of IE-specific atoms, like we have for other browsers, where you can create functions that bottle up everything you might want to do in a single command, so that the roundtrips are at their absolute minimum

[2013-07-03 13:53:27] gdennis: jimevans: ok, there's a chance I might take a cut at it myself, but not promising anything :)
[2013-07-03 13:53:28] jimevans: hirani: nope. that's not what you're looking for. that *only* affects finding elements. nothing else. full stop.

[2013-07-03 13:54:22] hirani: jimevans: i might have to then write a wrapper which checks if alert box is present based on size of $driver->get_windows_handles

[2013-07-03 13:54:35] hirani: jimevans: thanks though !
[2013-07-03 13:55:03] jimevans: hirani: not if you're looking for a javascript alert. alerts don't show up in the list of window handles
[2013-07-03 13:55:23] hirani: jimevans: i am looking for a js alert ... really ?
[2013-07-03 13:55:37] simonstewart, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-03 13:55:51] jimevans: what you'll want to do is write a wrapper that tries to switch to the alert (driver.switchTo().alert() in java), catch the exception if the alert doesn't exist, and try again.
[2013-07-03 13:56:40] hirani: hmm .. ok so i'll just do try { driver->get_alert_text() } catch { # do nothing } until the timeout expires or alert text is found
[2013-07-03 13:57:02] jimevans: hirani: sounds like it would work.
[2013-07-03 13:57:17] hirani: jimevans: thank you . i'll give that a go ! :)
