[2013-07-30 06:36:45] salman: here it is : $x("//span[@class='ui-button-text'][text()='Sign in']/..")

[2013-07-30 08:14:55] jimevans: you could switch_to() each window and interrogate it for the piece of information you're looking for.

[2013-07-30 08:22:34] jimevans: it's virtually impossible to find a one-size-fits-all approach that won't break somewhere else.
[2013-07-30 08:22:46] jimevans: that's one reason element.click() is asynchronous.
[2013-07-30 08:23:12] KaibutsuX: damn
[2013-07-30 08:23:20] jimevans: there's no way to reliably win the race condition, and what happens if a click just runs some javascript, and doesn't cause a navigation?
[2013-07-30 08:23:54] richdownie, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-30 08:23:57] jimevans: if you want to get into the business of parsing HTML and the DOM, that's fine, but it's not one i want to be any part of.

[2013-07-30 09:23:10] Dude-X: you can do many things
[2013-07-30 09:23:17] dhanush: Dude-X: as in?

[2013-07-30 09:24:26] phasze: dhanush: if your test makes it to the end it probably succeeded.  Usually an exception will be thrown if, for example, an element couldn't be found, etc.
[2013-07-30 09:25:28] Dude-X: you can use jenkins
[2013-07-30 09:25:33] Dude-X: or travis ci
[2013-07-30 09:25:33] b_mannix: Dude-X: pHash?
[2013-07-30 09:25:33] dhanush: phasze: okay. so its just about putting the test case in a try except and then just handling the exception right?
[2013-07-30 09:25:57] phasze: dhanush: that is one way of doing it
[2013-07-30 09:26:19] dhanush: phasze.okay.. thanks.
[2013-07-30 09:26:27] phasze: dhanush: I personally use NUnit to handle running my tests, it has the test divided into 3 parts, setup, teardown, and the actual test
[2013-07-30 09:26:29] dhanush: oh one way.
[2013-07-30 09:26:47] phasze: if an exception is thrown in the test then the teardown will clean it all up and report the failure
[2013-07-30 09:27:19] phasze: well, the teardown runs anyway but the actual framework of NUnit keeps track of most success/failure states
[2013-07-30 09:27:33] dhanush: hmm.okay.
[2013-07-30 09:28:12] phasze: I think it essentially wraps the test in a try/catch and if it catches anything it reports the failure
[2013-07-30 09:28:27] phasze: along with linenumber and exception
[2013-07-30 09:29:30] phasze: dhanush: like Dude-X said there are many frameworks out there already which will handle all that for you.

[2013-07-30 09:31:08] Dude-X: dhanush: you can just write the test and not write tons of try/catchs
[2013-07-30 09:31:15] phasze: They can keep track of all your tests, their success/failures, handle the database stuff, etc.  All depends on the type you use

[2013-07-30 11:51:23] Dude-X: seems like the test passed
[2013-07-30 11:51:41] dhanush: Dude-X: yeah because I handled the exception.
[2013-07-30 11:52:02] Dude-X: do you want the test to fail?
[2013-07-30 11:52:04] dhanush: Dude-X: so if I put a raise after the print. It fails. and prints all the message and stacktrace
[2013-07-30 11:52:06] Dude-X: then don't handle the exception
[2013-07-30 11:52:11] dhanush: Dude-X: for now yes.
[2013-07-30 11:52:17] Dude-X: just don't handle any exception
[2013-07-30 11:52:21] dhanush: Dude-X: not for production code
[2013-07-30 11:52:46] dhanush: Dude-X: yeah I wasnt handling it previously. so the test failed nicely enough.
[2013-07-30 11:52:47] Dude-X: a test should not handle exceptions unless it's part of a some routine
[2013-07-30 11:52:52] whhone, leaving. ("Leaving...")
[2013-07-30 11:53:04] Dude-X: if you  want to recover from an exception intelligently
[2013-07-30 11:53:14] Dude-X: create another file that is a page object representing the page you're on
[2013-07-30 11:53:30] Dude-X: and then you can wrap your calls
[2013-07-30 11:53:42] dhanush: Dude-X: I want to make some notifications. So when my test will ultimately run on a server every 2 minutes or so. I want to be notified if it fails.
[2013-07-30 11:54:19] Dude-X: you'd have to modify unit test to do something beyond printing an F on the line of dots

[2013-07-30 11:56:32] Dude-X: i don't know if you can configure unit test to fail and stop running
[2013-07-30 11:56:34] dhanush: Dude-X: Yeah so I have a seperate code for notifications. I will just invoke it with a dict containing the error. But for that I need to be able to correctly extract the exception. which isnt happpening yet.
[2013-07-30 11:59:16] Dude-X: so let me get this straight
[2013-07-30 11:59:35] Dude-X: you want an instant notification that a series of tests have failed on unittest
[2013-07-30 11:59:55] Dude-X: because unit test by default won't stop running because of an exception (unless you do something to crash unittest)
[2013-07-30 12:00:28] dhanush: Dude-X: okay. not even if I raise an exception?
[2013-07-30 12:00:52] Dude-X: if you raise an exception it will propagate
[2013-07-30 12:01:02] dhanush: Dude-X: my entire test will take hardly a minute. So even if I get the notif at the end. no problems.
[2013-07-30 12:01:04] Dude-X: and in the case of unit test, it will simply mark the test as failed
[2013-07-30 12:01:30] dhanush: Dude-X: okay. I will crash it then.
[2013-07-30 12:01:47] Dude-X: you do understand that unit test keeps running when a test fails (an exception is thrown and not handled)
[2013-07-30 12:01:52] qaguy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-07-30 12:02:18] dhanush: yeah I do. So even if test 1 fails. it keeps testing the others. I get that.
[2013-07-30 12:02:19] davidlai, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-30 12:02:28] Dude-X: ok
[2013-07-30 12:02:34] Dude-X: what do you want to do different?
[2013-07-30 12:03:20] dhanush: Dude-X: Not much. Basically I am seprating out all the components of the entire workflow. Login. connect. some process in between. disconnect. logout.
[2013-07-30 12:03:51] dhanush: so if any one fails all the subsequent tests are bound to fail. no point in testing further. I will crash it. and then notify.
[2013-07-30 12:04:18] dhanush: so the problem exists. I need to catch the exception and then read its args. which is not happening. :(
[2013-07-30 12:04:31] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-30 12:06:17] Dude-X: you want to have subsequent tests not run when a test fails in the workflow
[2013-07-30 12:06:24] Dude-X: that's not good test design
[2013-07-30 12:06:34] Dude-X: tests should be independent of each other
[2013-07-30 12:07:18] dhanush: Dude-X: Not good test design. But just for instance login doesnt work. is there any chance ever the rest of the workflow will work? It is bound to fail.
[2013-07-30 12:07:44] Dude-X: you can pass -f for fast fail
[2013-07-30 12:08:45] Dude-X: you can also take advantage of expected to fail
[2013-07-30 12:09:00] Dude-X: so that you can write tests and log it as expected to fail

[2013-07-30 12:11:15] dhanush: Dude-X: when I am handling the exception, I just want the stacktrace. thats it.
[2013-07-30 12:11:19] Dude-X: if a single test fails, you can use the fail fast option to stop running test
[2013-07-30 12:11:44] Dude-X: unit test should log the stack trace somewhere

[2013-07-30 12:13:25] Dude-X: another test framework
[2013-07-30 12:13:30] Dude-X: better than unittest
[2013-07-30 12:13:48] Dude-X: shows a very detailed stack trace
[2013-07-30 12:17:09] Dude-X: dhanush: in python it's called a "traceback"
[2013-07-30 12:17:10] Dude-X: so google
[2013-07-30 12:17:11] Dude-X: that
[2013-07-30 12:19:19] Dude-X: you can also check sys.exc_info() inside an exception handler
[2013-07-30 12:20:23] Dude-X: and then you can play with the traceback object in [2]

[2013-07-30 15:07:41] jimevans: sibichakravarthy: selenium is a library for automating browsers.
[2013-07-30 15:08:07] jimevans: what are you trying to accomplish?

[2013-07-30 15:10:01] sibichakravarthy: cool
[2013-07-30 15:10:02] jimevans: you can use python directly, or perhaps a python library that understands rtf.
[2013-07-30 15:10:18] jimevans: but selenium isn't the right tool for that job.
