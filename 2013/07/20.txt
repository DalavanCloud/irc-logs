I have a page with a form with multiple option values. what i want is to loop through selecing each of these and open a new page and get page content. i know how to do this if i use one selenium window, but i then have to navigate back which takes alot of resources. So my question is: is there any way to cache the first page so i dont have to reload the

[2013-07-20 15:34:32] Dude-X_: however you can open multiple browsers if its firefox
[2013-07-20 15:34:34] Dude-X_: or chrome
[2013-07-20 15:34:45] Dude-X_: :apidocs

[2013-07-20 15:34:59] lbod: hi, is the selenium site currently down?
[2013-07-20 15:35:01] apeaPer: Dude-X_: so there is no way to stay on one page and or just clone the object or somthing?
[2013-07-20 15:35:31] Dude-X_: lbod, the google code page is fine. i havne't checked seleniumhq.org
[2013-07-20 15:35:45] lbod: ah, thats the one thats showing the nginx page
[2013-07-20 15:35:49] apeaPer: seleniumhq.org have been down for me aatleast
[2013-07-20 15:36:04] Dude-X_: apeaPer: you can grab the domsource but then you're not dealing with what the browser sees
[2013-07-20 15:36:15] Dude-X_: there's no way to cache it.
[2013-07-20 15:36:38] Dude-X_: think of it this way, what can you do with one web browser?
[2013-07-20 15:36:40] apeaPer: bah :/
[2013-07-20 15:36:57] lbod, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-07-20 15:37:10] apeaPer: ohwell, my task is doable with navigating back, but it makes slower than neccecary
[2013-07-20 15:37:10] Dude-X_: you can have 20-50 firefox open though
[2013-07-20 15:37:21] Dude-X_: depends on your hardware
[2013-07-20 15:37:26] apeaPer: i have to use the Webdriver
[2013-07-20 15:37:36] Dude-X_: yeah with webdriver
[2013-07-20 15:38:50] Dude-X_: if it was python, you would write 'script.py' and then run it as so: python script.py option1 option3 & python script.py option2 option 4
[2013-07-20 15:39:01] Dude-X_: then it will fill your screen with multiple browsers
[2013-07-20 15:40:26] apeaPer: its in java, but the thing is i'm just gonna use this to parse out data some data, i dont think Firefox is a option since it requires it to be installed (or am i incorrect?)
[2013-07-20 15:40:41] Dude-X_: Java and what browser?
[2013-07-20 15:40:54] Dude-X_: you can start multiple JVMS too
[2013-07-20 15:40:57] Dude-X_: or you can thread
[2013-07-20 15:41:01] apeaPer: i use the HtmlUnitDriver
[2013-07-20 15:41:08] Dude-X_: oh that's so deprecated
[2013-07-20 15:41:14] Dude-X_: nevertheless
[2013-07-20 15:41:21] Dude-X_: it's the same idea
[2013-07-20 15:41:26] apeaPer: is there any other alternatives which doesnt need any dependencies
[2013-07-20 15:41:27] apeaPer: ?

[2013-07-20 15:41:34] Dude-X_: you write code that starts htmlunitdriver in each thread
[2013-07-20 15:41:52] Dude-X_: and each thread then reads different options (like the different options you want to read)

[2013-07-20 15:44:16] apeaPer: Dude-X_: so far ive just made a for loop which goes through each option and then clicks, after that i navigate back.  and its the last part i wish to skip. (navigating back). i would like to instead store the first page and submit the form in another window
[2013-07-20 15:44:38] Dude-X_: i am not sure if html unit driver is a real browser
[2013-07-20 15:44:44] Dude-X_: or it's like doing a wget
[2013-07-20 15:45:06] Dude-X_: but what you're describing sounds like a real browser
[2013-07-20 15:46:41] apeaPer: but its not a very big issue, it just makes executing the script abit less efficient. but the diffrence is only about 200 ms per iteration. so ill survive if its not supported :P
[2013-07-20 15:55:17] apeaPer: Thanks btw :)
[2013-07-20 15:55:35] Dude-X_: no problem
