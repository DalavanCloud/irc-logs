[2013-07-27 15:26:37] WLP|Away, changing nick to WillPittenger.
[2013-07-27 15:37:17] WillPittenger: I'm having troubles figuring out how to configure Grid nodes from within Java code.  I was told about http://www.testingexcellence.com/how-to-start-selenium-server-with-java-code/, but that doesn't explain how I get 10 Firefox nodes or how to specify the path to Firefox.
[2013-07-27 15:37:37] WillPittenger: Can someone help?  The JavaDocs are horrible.
[2013-07-27 15:43:53] barancev: you have to start nodes on different physical machines
[2013-07-27 15:44:17] barancev: so you hardly can do this "from within Java code"
[2013-07-27 15:44:21] WillPittenger: ??? Not what I was told earlier.
[2013-07-27 15:44:36] WillPittenger: That sample sure used only one machine.
[2013-07-27 15:44:47] barancev: you can start a selenium server on the *local* machine from withing the Java code
[2013-07-27 15:45:52] barancev: starting a distributed net of nodes is an infrastructure-level task
[2013-07-27 15:46:04] WillPittenger: What do you mean by the "server"?  The hub?
[2013-07-27 15:48:03] barancev: selenium server can run in a single-server mode, or as a part of a grid (being the hub or a node of the grid)
[2013-07-27 15:50:22] barancev: if you want "a grid that contains only one node" you don't have to start both hub and node, you can start a sigle-server instance
[2013-07-27 15:50:37] ryanpetrello, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-07-27 15:51:40] barancev: if you want "a multi-node grid" you have to start a single selenium server in hub mode and several and tselenium servers in node mode connected to the hub
[2013-07-27 15:52:07] WillPittenger: One node is enough as long as I can put 10 Firefox instances on it.
[2013-07-27 15:53:03] barancev: so you can use a single-server mode, and you can start the server from within Java code, on the local host
[2013-07-27 15:53:37] WillPittenger: So, back to my original question...
[2013-07-27 15:53:41] barancev: and you don't need to "configure nodes" because there are no nodes in this configuration :)
[2013-07-27 15:54:27] barancev: just a signle selenium server
[2013-07-27 15:54:28] WillPittenger: I still need 10 Firefox instances.  (Looks like I messed things up before calling them Nodes. :(  Sorry.)
[2013-07-27 15:54:49] WillPittenger: I also don't know how to tell it where Firefox is.
[2013-07-27 15:55:03] barancev: yes you can create 10 instances of RemoteWebDriver connected to the same selenium server, and you'll get 10 instances of the browser running
[2013-07-27 15:55:07] WillPittenger: I have both Firefox and Aurora folders.
[2013-07-27 15:55:56] barancev: unfortunately, you can't run different flavious of Firefox on the same server
[2013-07-27 15:56:19] WillPittenger: Well, I would probably run it once one way and then again another way.
[2013-07-27 15:56:30] WillPittenger: Once with Firefox and then with Aurora.
[2013-07-27 15:56:39] WillPittenger: Not at the same time.
[2013-07-27 15:56:45] barancev: to specify a custom location of the firefox binary you need to set Java property webdriver.firefox.bin
[2013-07-27 15:57:54] barancev: morover
[2013-07-27 15:58:19] barancev: if you want to run your tests locally you don't need the server at all!
[2013-07-27 15:58:34] barancev: just create 10 instances of FirefoxDriver, that's all
[2013-07-27 15:59:36] WillPittenger: Well, the instances need to be simultaneous.  The users would be voting on something.
[2013-07-27 16:00:06] barancev: sure, they all will run different instances of Firefox, each with its own profile
[2013-07-27 16:00:33] barancev: isolated as much as possible
[2013-07-27 16:00:53] WillPittenger: Ok.  That simplifies things.
