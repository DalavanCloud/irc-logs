[2013-07-24 07:31:53] gagangowda10: oh definitely!
[2013-07-24 07:32:51] gagangowda10: an good example is a graph that gets displayed if there are tickets... if not there is no data on the graph.
[2013-07-24 07:33:24] andreastt: Verifying that a Flash graph is correct given a data set can't be solved by Selenium.
[2013-07-24 07:33:34] andreastt: It sounds like something you might want to use a Flash automation solution for.
[2013-07-24 07:35:12] gagangowda10: andreastt: Flash automation? nice, will research on that now
[2013-07-24 07:36:09] andreastt: Before you ask: I don't know anything about that.
[2013-07-24 07:37:01] andreastt: What I'd do is to write a unit test to check the data set generation, a Selenium test for checking that it's properly rendered and interactable on the page, and some other kind of Flash test for making sure the graph is rendered with a mocked data set.
[2013-07-24 07:38:31] MathworksKevin: Hey guys

[2013-07-24 08:46:36] jimevans: Dude-X: in python, you don't really have "private" methods. in other languages, the "create web element" piece would be hidden by use of proper method scoping.

[2013-07-24 08:46:55] asavchuk: Dude-X: this command as i know for extending WebElement class. If you extend it you need to extend WebDriver and overwrite this method. After that WebDriver will use your implementation of WebElement.

[2013-07-24 09:28:37] jimevans: timbo1: two suggestions. disable native events (less recommended), or turn on the requireWindowFocus capability (more recommended)
[2013-07-24 09:29:02] timbo1: jimevans: where would you turn on the requireWindowFocus?
[2013-07-24 09:29:44] jimevans: it's a capability. add it as a capability in the constructor (or use the InternetExplorerOptions class, depending on what language you're using)
[2013-07-24 09:30:08] timbo1: ah okay
[2013-07-24 09:30:12] timbo1: I'll set it when I start the node?
[2013-07-24 09:30:27] jimevans: no, it gets set when you start a session within your tests.
[2013-07-24 09:30:47] RexButler: Dude-X:  So what's the difference?  What change in context makes the big builds less reliable than the local ones? Hmm...
[2013-07-24 09:31:17] Dude-X: slower network, CPU spikes, latency in data base calls, etc

[2013-07-24 09:36:44] Dude-X: on a server that's using xvfb or some other clunnkier GUI it will cause hiccups
[2013-07-24 09:37:15] RexButler: Dude-X:  Still, it seems running the whole nightly suite -locally- is less reliable than running the tests individually throughout the day
[2013-07-24 09:37:41] Dude-X: i know your pain. at a prior job all I did was fix nightly tests

[2013-07-24 09:47:07] timbo1: I know, just updating you :)
[2013-07-24 09:47:18] jimevans: but using requireWindowFocus is about as close as you'll get to actual user interactions with keyboard and mouse.
[2013-07-24 09:47:40] jimevans: it's possible the coordinates are being calculated wrong, but that's somewhat unlikely.
[2013-07-24 09:47:45] timbo1: is the disabling native events a capabilities as well?
[2013-07-24 09:48:43] jimevans: for IE, yes. nativeEvents = false.

Or simply, how can I send a task to certain instance by checking if it's busy or not?
[2013-07-24 11:56:07] dimacus: i_am_good:  why do they have to be in FIFO?

[2013-07-24 11:58:53] dimacus: it is nothing but pain in long turn
[2013-07-24 11:58:56] i_am_good: ah, i see

[2013-07-24 12:01:08] dimacus: i_am_good:  however, if you are not caring about order of tests per seâ€¦ you can take the whole list of tests, split them into 15 list of tests, and start a new "browser" session per list

[2013-07-24 12:08:49] dimacus: i_am_good:  not per se
[2013-07-24 12:09:19] dimacus: but say you have 15 hosts, and you can run those tests in parallel, each time you ask for a new browsers, one of 15 will be used
[2013-07-24 12:09:37] dimacus: so what i do is i take all the tests (test files) and put them into an array
[2013-07-24 12:09:57] dimacus: then slice array in X parts, and run each slice of the array in 1 browsers
[2013-07-24 12:10:02] dimacus: so sort of auto balance
[2013-07-24 12:11:33] i_am_good: ahhh. but I have dynamically growing # of tests, like 17 and a server w/ 15 instances and split them as you said, what happens to the last two?
[2013-07-24 12:12:20] dimacus: well 2 of the 15 servers will run 2 tests each instead of just 1

[2013-07-24 12:16:25] i_am_good: Thanks dude, I'll do it this way. I was trying to do in a way so that there would be a Selenium server that runs all the time with X instances and a queue that manages incoming tests and if more than X it would hold them until some more instances freed
[2013-07-24 12:16:34] i_am_good: But splitting also works for me
[2013-07-24 12:18:02] i_am_good: by 'this' I mean what you suggested
[2013-07-24 12:18:17] dimacus: cool :)
[2013-07-24 12:18:35] cgoldberg: dimacus, i_am_good... do you do any work with local concurrency? (i.e. not Sel Grid or multi machine)
[2013-07-24 12:19:12] dimacus: i_am_good: just remeber, RAM is your hard limitâ€¦ it's ok to split your tests into 5 threads each thread with 3 tests
[2013-07-24 12:19:20] dimacus: cgoldberg:  yup i do both
[2013-07-24 12:19:21] i_am_good: cgoldberg: yes, but the machine becomes so slow with more tests
[2013-07-24 12:19:36] cgoldberg: i've had real good success (in python) with local parallel tests,
[2013-07-24 12:19:56] i_am_good: dimacus: I'm gonna rent a server with 128gb ram from OVH, hopefully it will be enough :D
[2013-07-24 12:20:11] cgoldberg: i_am_good, mine scales nicely with processor cores... so i can provision larger VM's and get big time reductions in test runs
[2013-07-24 12:20:20] dimacus: yeah same hereâ€¦ but upper limit is 6 tests on a 16GB machine (Granted each thread had a full instance of stack loaded intom memoryâ€¦ MySQL being the slowest point)

[2013-07-24 12:22:55] dimacus: cgoldberg:  againâ€¦ i'm talking about a full stack per core of the run timeâ€¦ so the whole instance of groupon.com is running on each one of the 7 PIDs
[2013-07-24 12:23:16] dimacus: not the best way to do it, and i'm working on moving thatâ€¦ but this is the best way to garantee no test polution
[2013-07-24 12:23:35] Dude-X: i was able to run 40-50 instances of a browser on a dual core machine with 8Gb of ram on a ubuntu workstation
[2013-07-24 12:23:52] cgoldberg: if your tests are purely processor bound... it doesnt make sense to run more prallelism than number of cores you have... but in reality, there is lots of I/O waiting in many tests.. good rule of thumb is double the number of cores you have.... so usually go up to 8 on a 4 core box, etc
[2013-07-24 12:23:54] Dude-X: but if it's farmed out using Grid, it seems the limit is about 2.5 browsers per core
[2013-07-24 12:24:03] Dude-X: and you need low latency for the network

[2013-07-24 12:25:10] Prometheian: Anyone here run JUnit tests on Ubuntu machines? Mine require I add a Thread.wait() before any frame switches to numerical frames.
[2013-07-24 12:25:17] cgoldberg: dimacus, groupon must be huge.  i run many local instances of svelt Django apps on 4GB machines
[2013-07-24 12:25:44] dimacus: yeahâ€¦ it is.. a lot of code and a lot of stuff in DB
[2013-07-24 12:25:52] dimacus: customers only see 10% of the whole app
[2013-07-24 12:25:58] cgoldberg: dimacus, isit java?
[2013-07-24 12:26:02] dimacus: rails
[2013-07-24 12:26:14] dimacus: so that's a performance hit right there
[2013-07-24 12:26:14] cgoldberg: interesting.. big rails app
[2013-07-24 12:26:37] cgoldberg: im a 100% python guy these days.. but have worked on many stacks
[2013-07-24 12:28:23] Prometheian: I take that statement back. It only does that for some tests. T.T

[2013-07-24 12:30:00] dawagner: If we make the logging less verbose, we can store more history
[2013-07-24 12:30:11] barancev: let's delete built jars, not the logs
[2013-07-24 12:30:11] dawagner: As it stands, one commit is roughly a gig of log storage.

[2013-07-24 12:32:39] cgoldberg: i'm really excited for it
[2013-07-24 12:32:53] andreastt: cgoldberg: Yes, it looks very promising.
[2013-07-24 12:33:10] barancev: we have ~50 jobs, be a log 10M, it should take ~500M
[2013-07-24 12:33:19] *dimacus starts googling UbuntuEdge'
[2013-07-24 12:33:53] andreastt: cgoldberg: I just love the thought of the device as a portable computer.
[2013-07-24 12:33:54] Dude-X: 600 bucks is a bit pricey
[2013-07-24 12:33:58] barancev: can we keep al least published test results, not the raw logs?
[2013-07-24 12:34:01] Dude-X: then again i paid nearly 700+ for the iPhone 5
[2013-07-24 12:34:02] cgoldberg: andreastt, i ordered one.  I *hope* we make the funding.  5 million usd raised in first 2 days (of 32 million raised)... we have 30 days
[2013-07-24 12:34:13] andreastt: cgoldberg: In general I hate hardware (it gets in the way).  But this thing I might like.
[2013-07-24 12:34:17] dawagner: I don't believe jenkins has that flexibility.
[2013-07-24 12:34:19] dimacus: can i host a rails app on it?
[2013-07-24 12:34:29] cgoldberg: Dude-X, it totally pricey, and it goes up each day
[2013-07-24 12:34:40] cgoldberg: dimacus, of course you can
[2013-07-24 12:34:41] dimacus: i'll be a walking website

[2013-07-24 12:34:54] cgoldberg: dimacus, it could be your entire work/dev computer (and phone)
[2013-07-24 12:35:22] Prometheian: Anyone here use an iPhone or Android emulator to run tests?
[2013-07-24 12:35:25] dawagner: I would like to be able to keep a larger number of failing logs than non-failing logs, but also no flexibility from jenkins
[2013-07-24 12:35:27] dawagner: Maybe there is a plugin
[2013-07-24 12:35:41] cgoldberg: Dude-X, 128GB internal storage, 4 GB Ram, sapphire chrystal 4.5 display.  rest is to be updated as it get closer to production... to the latest and greatest
[2013-07-24 12:35:54] andreastt: cgoldberg: My ideal computer sits in a server centre somewhere, but having a cheap and portable device as a terminal is an amazing innovation.
[2013-07-24 12:35:59] Dude-X: cgoldberg: then in that case, 600 bucks is a great deal

[2013-07-24 12:37:28] Dude-X: now imagine it covering the whole display
[2013-07-24 12:37:44] Dude-X: hopefully no weird purple blue issues at odd angles

[2013-07-24 12:38:06] Dude-X: interesting
[2013-07-24 12:38:22] dimacus: i can see that being useful with some sort of a laptop keyboard attachment
[2013-07-24 12:38:26] Dude-X: will it have an OS tuned to the needs for mobile?
[2013-07-24 12:38:29] cgoldberg: dimacus, and Ubuntu runs quite snappy on ARM processors with 4GB RAM
[2013-07-24 12:38:38] dimacus: yeah i belive ya
[2013-07-24 12:38:57] cgoldberg: Dude-X, we are yes.. it's called Ubuntu Touch
[2013-07-24 12:39:12] cgoldberg: Dude-X its available now (early versions)
[2013-07-24 12:39:34] Dude-X: will it also be tuned to not eat battery life?
[2013-07-24 12:39:38] dimacus: the phone itself looks pretty sharp also
[2013-07-24 12:40:26] cgoldberg: Dude-X, it's ARM so it should be good on battery.. it uses silicon-anode technology for battery (whatever that is)
[2013-07-24 12:40:41] Dude-X: never heard of that.
[2013-07-24 12:41:00] Dude-X: it sounds like a sweet phone. i'll wait for the second revision before i invest in one.
[2013-07-24 12:41:16] Dude-X: it's now my official policy to by only the S versions of iPhones.
[2013-07-24 12:41:58] cgoldberg: Dude-X, these are the limited souped up versions for first adopters (40k produced).  it should land on several other devices on national carriers next year also
[2013-07-24 12:42:41] dimacus: they are already sold out

[2013-07-24 12:47:31] barancev: but I hoped to fix it before you update your envs :)
[2013-07-24 12:49:06] santiycr: barancev: is this broken in specific chromedriver versions?
[2013-07-24 12:49:09] santiycr: or all of them?

[2013-07-24 12:59:33] cgoldberg: adam___, the python bindings for firefox definitely has issues when running many instances (more than say 20)... i use a hack to get slightly more
[2013-07-24 12:59:43] cgoldberg: adam___, what language are you using?

[2013-07-24 13:02:39] cgoldberg: he will eventually enter a bug against selenium and propose a patch (i hope).. but has been on vacation.. so its our stopgap solution
[2013-07-24 13:02:40] adam___: cgoldberg is it possible you can share that hack?

[2013-07-24 13:03:51] adam___: thanks
[2013-07-24 13:04:25] adam___: did you notice the tmp folder increases a lot in size? 10-30 mb per profile
[2013-07-24 13:04:38] adam___: when running 30 instances in one hour it had 10gb of profiles
[2013-07-24 13:05:03] cgoldberg: adam___, i believe we had to deal with cleaning tmp as well.. but its all built into our framework
[2013-07-24 13:05:07] Dude-X: it should clean up the tmp profiles when closed properly

[2013-07-24 13:10:22] Dude-X: i did kind of a similar thing a while back in Java, mostly due to the port opening issue
[2013-07-24 13:12:03] Dude-X: basically try to instantiate a driver and if it fails, try again but give up after 5 times
[2013-07-24 13:12:25] Dude-X: i think that's fixed now in the java code
[2013-07-24 13:13:17] cgoldberg: we gotta get into python bindings :)
[2013-07-24 13:13:23] cgoldberg: first step is enter a bug
[2013-07-24 13:13:48] Prometheian: I'm trying to make my tests write out their file names if they fail. So far I've accomplished this by adding, into the class all my tests extend, an @Rule that just creates a new instance of another class.  http://www.hastebin.com/pefikosabu.java is the code for that other class, but right now it isn't doing anything, not even writing a "test" in. Can anyone throw an eye my way?

[2013-07-24 14:01:13] dave_s: What do I need to get started with testing with php?
[2013-07-24 14:01:30] dave_s: The documentation makes no sense.
[2013-07-24 14:04:21] evanmcd: dave_s I started with PHPUnit and the demos from sauce labs... using the Sausage library
[2013-07-24 14:04:52] cgoldberg: adam___, xvfb is just used so you can run it on a headless server.. it doesn't help your tests in any way
[2013-07-24 14:05:04] dave_s: evanmcd: My problem is I have no idea where to even start. The links on the site have me hopping all over the place and I'm just confused.
[2013-07-24 14:05:33] cgoldberg: adam___, it's a virtual X server... so you don't need a physical display attached (aka a server in a rack or something)
[2013-07-24 14:05:37] dave_s: It's not clear on what needs installed and how to get started.
[2013-07-24 14:05:41] evanmcd: dave_s yeah it is a bit tricky to get started
[2013-07-24 14:06:01] evanmcd: dave_s did you start with the Saucelabs demo?
[2013-07-24 14:06:02] dave_s: You would think the documentation would at least make sense.
[2013-07-24 14:06:45] evanmcd: dave_s https://saucelabs.com/php
[2013-07-24 14:06:48] cgoldberg: adam___, it's also useful running locally.. personally i'd rather watch a clean log file scroll by than a bunch of browser windows popping up everywhere
[2013-07-24 14:07:08] dave_s: evanmcd: No, I started with the IDE, realized it's useless and quickly discovered that anything beyond the IDE is incomprehensible, and trying to find links to outside tutorials is no good since they're all done by people who speak english as a second language or use the "Old" way of doing things with RC.
[2013-07-24 14:07:09] adam___: cgoldberg thanks for explaning that. i was thinking xvfb would make the tests faster and use less resources
[2013-07-24 14:07:31] cgoldberg: adam___, nope.. purely do emulate a display

[2013-07-24 14:10:46] adam___: have you ever tried starting a browser minimized? i mean is that possible?
[2013-07-24 14:10:55] cgoldberg: adam___,   *and* you can screenshot inside the virtual display
[2013-07-24 14:11:39] cgoldberg: so you dont see the tests run.. just their logs... but you get a screen shot on any error ... at least thats what my framework does)

[2013-07-24 14:28:44] timbo1: IE 8 and IE 9 stayed fine

[2013-07-24 14:30:09] lukeis: but he doesn't like / do java

[2013-07-24 14:30:43] timbo1: ah, I remember lukeis, he helped me a while back
[2013-07-24 14:30:45] cgoldberg: masochist
[2013-07-24 14:30:48] lukeis: ;)
[2013-07-24 14:30:51] timbo1: I like / do java :P
[2013-07-24 14:31:20] lukeis: simon is also pretty deep in a relationship with java :)
[2013-07-24 14:31:29] cgoldberg: and meant "like".. i know lots of people "do"
[2013-07-24 14:31:41] lukeis: well, i certainly don't hate it
[2013-07-24 14:31:42] timbo1: well thats true cgoldberg
[2013-07-24 14:31:50] lukeis: i like python
[2013-07-24 14:32:02] cgoldberg: i did a comp sci degree all in java.. haven't really touched the language since :)
[2013-07-24 14:32:04] lukeis: i used to like javascriptâ€¦ but now don't really
[2013-07-24 14:32:22] lukeis: my comp sci was in C++ â€¦ they had one class in java
[2013-07-24 14:32:28] cgoldberg: lukeis, i don't like python.. i *love* python
[2013-07-24 14:32:32] lukeis: ;)
[2013-07-24 14:32:40] timbo1: I did c++ in school
[2013-07-24 14:32:43] timbo1: and all java now at work
[2013-07-24 14:32:43] andreastt: The right tool for the job.
[2013-07-24 14:32:51] lukeis: i *love* programmingâ€¦ the language doesn't matter too much to me
[2013-07-24 14:33:02] cgoldberg: lukeis, my undergrad was in C++ and Scheme/LISP
[2013-07-24 14:33:07] timbo1: assembly lukeis? :)
[2013-07-24 14:33:18] lukeis: i did assembly and liked it ;)
[2013-07-24 14:33:26] timbo1: you are a true programmer
[2013-07-24 14:33:27] timbo1: then
[2013-07-24 14:33:27] timbo1: ahhaha
[2013-07-24 14:33:36] cgoldberg: lukeis, i love it also.. just have some preferences.. if i had to i'd be using an abacus and having a blast at it

[2013-07-24 14:34:55] timbo1: so now tell me why all the sudden selenium is giving me so many problems :(
[2013-07-24 14:35:16] lukeis: it's not selenium necessarily selenium ;)
[2013-07-24 14:36:16] cgoldberg: timbo1, start small,  understand your environment.. simple things... if you have this massive ball of tests and something acts up.. of course your gonna blame the software (and have no idea where/how to fix your problems)
[2013-07-24 14:36:44] timbo1: well, we have 5 browsers going
[2013-07-24 14:36:50] timbo1: and then 1 line code change went out
[2013-07-24 14:37:00] timbo1: and 3 browsers are failing on sets of different tests
[2013-07-24 14:37:03] cgoldberg: timbo1, do you have a suite that runs ROCK SOLID in one browser?
[2013-07-24 14:37:09] timbo1: IE 8 and IE 9
[2013-07-24 14:37:14] timbo1: still works like a charm
[2013-07-24 14:37:32] cgoldberg: well wtf was in the one line change?
[2013-07-24 14:38:20] adam___: cgoldberg what were you using before selenium for your automation tests?
[2013-07-24 14:38:24] timbo1: nothing!

[2013-07-24 14:38:51] cgoldberg: timbo1, and you obviously you have crappy logging/debugging going on in your setup if you don't know whats causing an error
[2013-07-24 14:38:56] timbo1: well the chrome is having a issue that is not a wtf issue. my chrome is starting with the default tab and getting stuck there
[2013-07-24 14:39:09] timbo1: the other browsers are just notâ€¦clicking the element
[2013-07-24 14:39:19] timbo1: when I am phsyically watching the browser
[2013-07-24 14:39:29] timbo1: which all worked before
[2013-07-24 14:40:40] cgoldberg: adam___, i've used many old proprietary tools (Silk, Mercury, etc).. hated all of them... started writing my own test tools and frameworks around 2004.  but thats just for front-end/acceptance automation.. i was previously more into unit testing and performance testing
[2013-07-24 14:41:19] hirani, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-24 14:42:09] cgoldberg: adam___,  selenium (specifically webdriver) is the best i've used for driving browsers.. and being open source is a prerequisite for me to even touch

[2013-07-24 14:45:17] cgoldberg: timbo1, what happens on an error in your setup?.. do you get nice logs of whats going on?... screenshots? saved stack traces? page source dumps? etc..  If not, and it just blows up and leaves you clueless.... you need to step back and think about a framework and test structure
[2013-07-24 14:46:17] timbo1: I agree cgoldberg
[2013-07-24 14:46:28] timbo1: But all I have is the stack trace + logs atm
[2013-07-24 14:47:44] cgoldberg: timbo1, is this a one-off little project.. or is this the basis for a larger automation effort?
[2013-07-24 14:47:49] jimevans, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-07-24 14:48:56] adam___: nice you seem like a real pro... im new to all of this. i do have a system setup where the testing is done and is stable if using 20 instances. do you have an idea how i can run more instances? i can buy a bunch of vps's and they can share one db? i see they have services which allow you to run your tests on clouds but it seems expensive
[2013-07-24 14:49:26] timbo1: its pretty much the effort to automatic the testing for a site
[2013-07-24 14:50:01] cgoldberg: timbo1, like i said then.. step back and refactor some stuff to give you good logging and errors
[2013-07-24 14:50:29] cgoldberg: adam___, you can use selenium grid.  or are you already?
[2013-07-24 14:50:33] timbo1: well don't really have the time
[2013-07-24 14:50:39] timbo1: releases can't go out
[2013-07-24 14:50:48] adam___: not using grid yet
[2013-07-24 14:50:49] timbo1: till the tests pass with all the browsers
[2013-07-24 14:51:22] cgoldberg: timbo1, you've been been building up technical debt.. and you just got a call from the banker :)
[2013-07-24 14:51:28] cgoldberg: (sorry for bad analogy)
[2013-07-24 14:51:47] timbo1: its just I am mad at this whole thing too
[2013-07-24 14:51:50] timbo1: I am not even the SDET
[2013-07-24 14:51:57] timbo1: and I get stuck fixing these
[2013-07-24 14:52:02] cgoldberg: adam___, look into Grid to provision tests across several machines
[2013-07-24 14:52:18] cgoldberg: adam___, do you use Jenkins at all (or similar CI system)
[2013-07-24 14:53:38] cgoldberg: adam___, you can do some cool stuff with Jenkins master-slave setup, and use it as a bastardized test controller across a farm of slave machines
[2013-07-24 14:53:38] adam___: no, not using jenkins
[2013-07-24 14:54:43] cgoldberg: run your 20 processes per machine... and have jenkins run chuncks of tests on various slave configurations or whatever
[2013-07-24 14:55:02] cgoldberg: adam___, do you use *any* continuous integration?
