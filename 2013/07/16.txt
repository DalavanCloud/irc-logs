[2013-07-16 11:40:30] tedwards_: Ah.. I see.. Does WebDriver have the browser_network_traffic capability tucked away somewhere I'm not looking?
[2013-07-16 11:40:47] tedwards_: I'd be interesting in dumping that on test failures and storing the data in my build system.
[2013-07-16 11:41:01] tedwards_: interested*
[2013-07-16 11:42:27] jimevans: tedwards_: there's nothing in the webdriver api that allows you to analyze network traffic.
[2013-07-16 11:42:41] jimevans: that's a conscious design decision in the api
[2013-07-16 11:42:58] tedwards_: Fair enough.. if I wanted it badly enough I could get it anyways.

[2013-07-16 13:46:14] watsonmw: Hey Jim, did you want to ask me about that ie driver patch?
[2013-07-16 13:46:41] jimevans: watsonmw: yeah, i kinda did.
[2013-07-16 13:47:15] jimevans: so when i merged it into my local IEDriverServer, and tried to run the integration tests, i see some anomalies.
[2013-07-16 13:47:25] jimevans: like the alerts tests all fail.
[2013-07-16 13:47:50] jimevans: it's like they're not able to click on the element that brings up the alert. which is odd, because other clicks work fine.
[2013-07-16 13:47:59] foundatron, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-16 13:48:35] watsonmw: ok ill give it go with and without the patch

[2013-07-16 13:48:56] jimevans: thanks. oh, sorry. i should mention i was forcing use of shellwindows.
[2013-07-16 13:49:10] jimevans: wanted to make sure that functionality was working.
[2013-07-16 13:49:56] Dude-X: raboof: yes
[2013-07-16 13:49:58] watsonmw: oh np i should have tried the tests anyway
[2013-07-16 13:51:27] raboof: i was looking at the bottom 10 or so lines of org.openqa.selenium.internal.seleniumemulation.Type.java , and it strikes me as odd that it uses the 'javascript' method whenever it is available
[2013-07-16 13:51:52] tedwards_, quitting. (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[2013-07-16 13:52:12] raboof: the non-javascript way seems preferable if available, given that the javascript includes all of type.js, which is like 50kb of javascript code
[2013-07-16 13:52:13] jimevans: watsonmw: also, you're going to hate me.
[2013-07-16 13:52:16] jimevans: :)
[2013-07-16 13:52:27] raboof: but i'm new to the codebase so perhaps i'm missing something - would be interested to learn.
[2013-07-16 13:52:51] jimevans: i'm in the process of refactoring a bunch of the code in BrowserFactory.cpp. I'll adapt your changes when you're ready to submit.
[2013-07-16 13:55:35] watsonmw: oh yeah my crazy long method names probably didnt help the state of things
[2013-07-16 13:56:59] Prometheian: Could someone take a look at this tack trace? I have no idea why I'm getting an Empty pool of VM. http://www.hastebin.com/neluquvuti.sm

[2013-07-16 13:59:44] jimevans: watsonmw: heh. not so much that, actually, as the fact that there's a ton of stuff in the command executor that really ought to be member variables in the browser factory, since each executor gets its own factory. :)(
