[2013-07-31 02:03:15] asavchuk: not sure. maybe we need to run test IE driver with requireWindowFocus ?

[2013-07-31 07:59:08] asavchuk: in driver trace log i saw that in both cases (global and per-process) correct capabilities are set. also i added timeout to check how it's shown in IE browser settings (in both cases) - it did not set too.
[2013-07-31 07:59:09] jimevans: asavchuk: also, you're not using a windows service to run IE tests, right?

[2013-07-31 09:05:27] jimevans: what makes it really odd is that the heavy lifting is done inside iedriverserver.exe. there shouldn't be anything specific in the language bindings that makes it fail. let my try python.

[2013-07-31 09:12:57] jimevans: java still fails for me, though.
[2013-07-31 09:13:25] jimevans: so there's something specific to the java language bindings that causes iedriverserver to not be able to set the proxy.

[2013-07-31 11:36:48] Dude-X: smccarthy: in python i do button = (By.CSS_SELECTOR, '.button')

[2013-07-31 11:37:45] AutomatedTester: barancev: induced?
[2013-07-31 11:37:46] Dude-X: smccarthy: in Java i created a Locator class that is similar to the python one so I write Locator button = new Locator('css', '.button')
[2013-07-31 11:38:07] barancev: AutomatedTester: induced by previous failures
[2013-07-31 11:38:15] AutomatedTester: barancev: aha
[2013-07-31 11:38:30] smccarthy: Dude-X: but how do you know button is a locator in your page object? Besides looking at the declaration ?
[2013-07-31 11:38:31] Dude-X: but I have a wrapper to the webdriver API that allows me to decode locators
[2013-07-31 11:38:42] whhone, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-07-31 11:39:09] Dude-X: smccarthy: it has to be, you can't get web elements "ahead of time"
[2013-07-31 11:39:58] smccarthy: Dude-X: sorry I don't think I am being clear on what I want. I am looking for a naming standard, not how to get the element.
[2013-07-31 11:40:44] Dude-X: smccarthy: i see. the assumption is that you have a locator inside a page object
[2013-07-31 11:44:01] Dude-X: when i did webdriver tests in java, locators just had plain names (redSubmitButton), but WebElements had element in their name - rowsOfStudentsElements
[2013-07-31 11:44:58] Dude-X: however, the method arguments were pretty clear what you're working with
[2013-07-31 11:45:03] Dude-X: and the type declarations
[2013-07-31 11:47:05] smccarthy: Dude-X: I was using "username" as the name of my username text field by locator. But then I may run into my enterUsername(String username) function. Than I have to use this.username and stuff. Just seems like it might be confusing for someone reading the code
[2013-07-31 11:47:47] hirani, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-07-31 11:48:45] Dude-X: smccarthy: i find it best to have a very good description of the locator or object. it's annoying when i see something non descriptor like "red button" when there are two red buttons on the page
[2013-07-31 11:50:32] Dude-X: for username i would use username_input_field; in Java, i would make it a constant string static so it would be "USERNAME_INPUT_FIELD"
[2013-07-31 11:51:08] Dude-X: also private
[2013-07-31 11:51:23] awilson820, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-31 11:51:29] Dude-X: the page object should not expose its internals to the test
[2013-07-31 11:54:11] Dude-X: smccarthy: so pro tip: use the uppercase naming for locators.
[2013-07-31 11:54:32] Dude-X: and use static private final
[2013-07-31 11:55:01] smccarthy: Dude-X: yea its private already. but making it FINAL and static and upcase is probably useful too. thx

[2013-07-31 11:59:02] davidlai: probably better to minus the static.  If you're running threaded tests, the static will not allow you to have multiple instances of the same webelement.

[2013-07-31 12:09:17] rzec: Is there anyway with the selenium webdriver to be able to test if the text in an input element is selected?
[2013-07-31 12:09:22] Dude-X: davidlai: i put all the locators on top too.
[2013-07-31 12:09:44] Dude-X: rzec: if you have a web element you can call .is_selected() or isSelected()
[2013-07-31 12:10:12] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-31 12:11:10] rzec: also, would this be the correct way to focus an element : driver.findElement(protractor.By.css('.display')).click() ?
[2013-07-31 12:11:23] rzec: not I am using webdriverjs
[2013-07-31 12:11:26] rzec: note*
[2013-07-31 12:12:01] Dude-X: calling findElement just gives you a node
[2013-07-31 12:12:06] rzec: I know that driver.findElement(protractor.By.css('.display')) does return the element, not sure if .click() is the right way to focus the element
[2013-07-31 12:13:19] rzec: so I need a web element and note a node?
[2013-07-31 12:13:24] rzec: not*
[2013-07-31 12:14:50] Dude-X: it returns a WebElement
[2013-07-31 12:15:15] Dude-X: when you call click, it will "click" on the web element you fetched
[2013-07-31 12:16:15] dhanush, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-31 12:17:30] Dude-X: it doesn't put it into focus
[2013-07-31 12:17:38] Dude-X: there is webdriver.switch_to_active_element()
[2013-07-31 12:17:55] Dude-X: that returns a web element that is under focus
[2013-07-31 12:19:35] rzec: well I have determined the .click() is working because running : driver.switchTo().activeElement() : after I do that is returning the right element however I don't think .isSelected() is what I am looking for.
[2013-07-31 12:19:56] rzec: reading the documentation for .isSelected seems like it is for radio/checkbox/select box
[2013-07-31 12:20:54] rzec: I am trying to figure out if it is possible to tell if the text in a textbox is selected (like when mouse click and drag over the text), maybe this level to detection is not possible
[2013-07-31 12:22:31] Dude-X: that level of selection is probably an OS thing
[2013-07-31 12:22:34] jimevans: rzec: use javascript, maybe?

[2013-07-31 13:26:08] phasze: how?
[2013-07-31 13:26:14] jimevans: each constructor has an overload that lets you set that with a TimeSpan
