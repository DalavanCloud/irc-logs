[2013-07-05 07:48:33] arex\: Instead of having to have a try/catch block in every test ( http://pastie.org/private/utabrrwavhneddjslqbnmq ), I'm now wrapping the Assert class ( http://pastie.org/private/uew4svze5dileqmuihxd8g ). Is there an even better way of automatically taking a screenshot whenever an Assert fails?

[2013-07-05 08:17:56] PePo__: i believe that's what i'm doing right now.. i run multiple threads and each starts a browser instance
[2013-07-05 08:18:09] PePo__: but is't this a waste of memory?
[2013-07-05 08:18:33] jimevans: PePo__: since most browsers isolate tabs in their own process these days anyway, i don't see how it would be.
[2013-07-05 08:18:35] wolcanus, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-07-05 08:18:41] jimevans: (or at least chrome and IE do)
[2013-07-05 08:19:30] jimevans: and remember, running browser-based automation is extremely heavyweight. you should be doing as little of it as humanly possible.
[2013-07-05 08:19:31] PePo__: so that means regardless of using tabs or new instances, the amount of memory used is the same?
[2013-07-05 08:19:33] whhone, quitting. (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[2013-07-05 08:20:08] jimevans: i wouldn't presume to predict whether that was strictly true or not. i'm far from an expert in the internal workings of the browsers from the various browser vendor.s
[2013-07-05 08:20:24] PePo__: sry english as a first language
[2013-07-05 08:21:03] PePo__: i mean english isn't my first language, thus all those "stupid" questions
[2013-07-05 08:22:29] jimevans: there is some performance overhead involved in spinning up a browser from scratch, but that's the price you pay if you want the browser instances to be isolated with unique profiles. i would imagine the amount of memory should be pretty close to the same though.
[2013-07-05 08:23:04] PePo__: ok, thank you very much

[2013-07-05 08:25:53] arex\\: i asked it a little while ago so you may be able to scroll and have a look at it
[2013-07-05 08:26:06] arex\\: if not, i'll type it out again (can't copy-paste it because i'm on another client right now)
[2013-07-05 08:27:12] PePo__: this is all i got from you: I'd be interested to know more about how you report your Selenium test results. Currently we just use the standard test result report generated by MSTest. I'd like to include screenshots, and my first thought is to generate a custom HTML report somehow

[2013-07-05 08:31:12] arex\\: ah, you found it
[2013-07-05 08:31:28] arex\\: no, my goal is to take a screenshot whenever an assertion fails

[2013-07-05 08:42:31] jimevans: arex\\: so i don't really know the MSFT test tools all that well, or at least not the test execution framework, but in the TestCleanup method, i think you can access the TestContext object to tell if the test passed or failed, and if it failed, take your screenshot.
[2013-07-05 08:43:05] arex\\: jimevans: Sweet! That's the kind of thing I was imagining :)
[2013-07-05 08:44:06] arex\\: jimevans: I guess it is a problem if I have multiple asserts in a test - but I guess you shouldn't have that anyway?
[2013-07-05 08:44:42] jimevans: no problem if you do. the first assert that fails should fail the test, and immediately move to the test cleanup method.
[2013-07-05 08:44:52] arex\\: oh, that is true
[2013-07-05 08:44:55] arex\\: d'oh
[2013-07-05 08:45:12] jimevans: and if you're in that state, you should already have solved the problem of determining which of your multiple asserts failed. :()
