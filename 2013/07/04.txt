[2013-07-04 04:20:09] millenium: there is known issue with IE and remoteWebDriver that it can't make screenshots (including with the remoteWebdriverScreenShot extension). So ... on "normal" browser screenshots are made the way should be, but on IE there is interesting issue, because the test run on Virtual Machine if I'm logged in it make normal SS but if I'm not with remote desktop there it make black screen shots

[2013-07-04 04:36:06] goldstar: I want to know whether it is possible to run selenium tests independently of the UI ? Everytime we make front end changes this always breaks a test.
[2013-07-04 04:37:54] millenium: I'm selenium "user" as you but maybe I can help you if you explain your issue with more details or example :)
[2013-07-04 04:41:20] goldstar: millenium:  well Im not the one writing the tests, i have a qa engineer who is managing this. So we have a made visual changes to a form for instance like moving CSS around, changing order and so on but consequently the test for the form fails
[2013-07-04 04:44:49] zeljkof, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-04 04:48:11] millenium: selenium is made to test the web application interface with other words UI :)
[2013-07-04 04:48:29] millenium: for what selenium tools you are talking about Selenium IDE?
[2013-07-04 04:51:54] millenium: if you use selenium webDriver then moving CSS around will not mess with the tests unless you don't check specially the CSS values in your tests, so ... if you have something with driver.findElement(by.Id("miButton")).click() you always will click on this button (no matter what margin or padding you use) if it's viable on the screen and not covered with some other web element

[2013-07-04 06:03:02] hirani: arex\: my tests are written using Perl bindings (https://metacpan.org/module/Selenium::Remote::Driver) . would i still be able to use the GRID?
[2013-07-04 06:08:10] arex\: hirani: yes, as far as i know
[2013-07-04 06:09:24] hirani: arex\: ok , thanks .... i shall take a closer look into the implementation
[2013-07-04 06:10:03] arex\: personally i use the c# bindings, and it works like a charm
[2013-07-04 06:10:17] hirani: arex\: ah , I see
[2013-07-04 06:11:04] hirani: arex\: i remember last time I tried I had trouble implementing it . Currently , I run the tests against a selenium-server
[2013-07-04 06:11:46] arex\: using grid isn't much different
[2013-07-04 06:11:53] millenium: arex\ tell me please with RemoteWebDriver and IE node do you have problems with screenshots?
[2013-07-04 06:12:19] arex\: millenium: i don't take screenshots :) thought i would try it soon though
[2013-07-04 06:12:54] hirani: arex\: so it isnt an issue that selenium grid uses remote control ? Could you explain to me the difference between Selenium RC and Selenium Server itself
[2013-07-04 06:13:08] millenium: for me screnshouts are live savers because writing test on local machine and testing it on it is one store, on grid is totally other :)
