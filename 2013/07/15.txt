[2013-07-15 01:08:48] arex\: I would like to measure front-end performance using my Selenium test suite. Ideas?
[2013-07-15 01:14:56] Mox[NL]: What kind of performance? like a stress test? Or you want to measure loading times for one client?
[2013-07-15 01:15:35] arex\: download time, execution time, render time - i imagine getting a HAR file from the browser or something similar
[2013-07-15 01:16:50] arex\: the idea is to make sure the user experience is good (performance wise)
[2013-07-15 01:17:27] arex\: i think i will use selenium -> jmeter for "system performance"/stress/load/peak testing
[2013-07-15 01:17:41] arex\: but now i need to cover the front-end part
[2013-07-15 01:18:25] arex\: ^ Mox[NL]
[2013-07-15 01:19:55] Mox[NL]: I'm not sure what the possibilities are, chrome has a build-in analizer for loadingtimes.. or you can use a plugin I guess; something like http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/
[2013-07-15 01:20:50] Mox[NL]: or you could just measure the total loading time after a click in selenium
[2013-07-15 01:21:07] arex\: yeah.. hoping to use something that can leverage our existing selenium test suite and be integrated into our continuous integration process
[2013-07-15 01:21:50] arex\: i would like something more comprehensive than a number or two.. that is why i'm currently looking at collecting HAR files
[2013-07-15 01:23:40] Mox[NL]: for automation maybe totals are enough.. when it exceeds the 'reasonable' treshold you can inspect manually where to improve...
[2013-07-15 01:24:25] arex\: that is a valid point - although CHARTS! :-)
[2013-07-15 01:25:23] arex\: i think i will start by looing at this -> https://github.com/lightbody/browsermob-proxy
[2013-07-15 01:26:50] Mox[NL]: that sounds like it does exactly what you want
[2013-07-15 01:27:45] arex\: yeah :) hopefully the REST API is sufficient (i'm on C#)
[2013-07-15 01:33:36] arex\: AutomatedTester: looks like you have a .net browsermob proxy project going on?

[2013-07-15 07:15:55] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: in theory marionette could automate it
[2013-07-15 07:16:09] AutomatedTester: since its using gecko
[2013-07-15 07:16:40] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, it uses the same API as phantom.js (i think)
[2013-07-15 07:17:47] cgoldberg: having a *really* fast gecko render without the rest of browser overhead would be nice

[2013-07-15 07:19:29] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, nice
[2013-07-15 07:19:43] AutomatedTester: I suspect it just requires packaging Marionette
[2013-07-15 07:20:00] AutomatedTester: and since Marionette is already in Nightly it should be trivial
[2013-07-15 07:21:17] gagangowda10: swente doing something like this "list1 =  driver.find_elements_by_xpath("//tbody/tr/td[contains(@class,'center sev')]")"
[2013-07-15 07:21:41] gagangowda10: would return a list of webelement locations like selenium.webdriver.remote.webelement.WebElement at 0x2701790
[2013-07-15 07:22:22] gagangowda10: if i try to do something like list1[1].text
[2013-07-15 07:22:42] gagangowda10: i get "stale element reference: element is not attached to the page document\n  (Session info: chrome=28.0.1500.71)\n  (Driver info: chromedriver=2.0,platform=Linux 3.5.0-36-generic x86_64)"

[2013-07-15 07:23:11] gagangowda10: jimevans
[2013-07-15 07:25:10] KaibutsuX: it means the element is no longer valid
[2013-07-15 07:25:20] KaibutsuX: it might have been removed from the dom or you navigated away

[2013-07-15 07:26:12] KaibutsuX: is it ajax-ed in or ajax modified?

[2013-07-15 07:30:02] gagangowda10: yup it is an ajax modified
[2013-07-15 07:30:15] gagangowda10: KaibutsuX
[2013-07-15 07:30:27] KaibutsuX: well then your ajax engine is probably removing it from the dom and re-adding the new one
[2013-07-15 07:30:34] KaibutsuX: meaning it's not the same element anymore
[2013-07-15 07:30:39] gagangowda10: manoj9788 thanks i am looking through

[2013-07-15 07:31:37] KaibutsuX: wait for the one you're expecting
[2013-07-15 07:32:30] TheCommieDuck: I'm trying to use implicitWait to wait for an element to load. However, I load one page then want to load another and repeat the same thing..so it will not 'wait' the second time for the element to reload and instead just uses the first element all the time. Is there any way to solve this?
[2013-07-15 07:32:37] TheCommieDuck: Other than repeatedly making new drivers

[2013-07-15 07:34:49] KaibutsuX: TheCommieDuck, the first element is a pointer to that element in the dom, the next time you load the page, it's not the same pointer anymore
[2013-07-15 07:35:12] TheCommieDuck: KaibutsuX: I am opening somesite.com/1 and waiting for element A to load. I then do stuff with it, navigate to somesite.com/2, wait for A to load. However, it'll wait for A on 1 to load, then do stuff, then not wait for A on 2 to load and reuse the element from 1.

[2013-07-15 07:35:45] TheCommieDuck: If I use driver.Quit() and make a new one each page it's fine, but that's a lot of added overhead
[2013-07-15 07:36:20] KaibutsuX: that doesn't make any sense, if you navigate to .com/2, A on 1 is no longer valid
[2013-07-15 07:36:37] KaibutsuX: it can't "re-use" element A on 1

[2013-07-15 07:38:52] KaibutsuX: how do you know the lookup isn't just faster on 2
[2013-07-15 07:38:58] jimevans: TheCommieDuck: first the driver.Navigate() call is unnecessary. setting the .Url property will trigger the navigation.
[2013-07-15 07:39:17] TheCommieDuck: KaibutsuX: Because it will take 5 seconds to do the first one and then 1 second to do the other 109, with the same results as 1
[2013-07-15 07:39:44] KaibutsuX: 5 seconds for an id lookup seems pretty slow, the other 109 seem about right
[2013-07-15 07:39:59] TheCommieDuck: KaibutsuX: it's steam's site. it's slow :P
[2013-07-15 07:40:42] KaibutsuX: so if you try myDynamicElement.text, if it's really the old element A from 1, that should throw a StaleElement Exception
[2013-07-15 07:40:54] jimevans: TheCommieDuck: does this happen with all browsers?
[2013-07-15 07:40:57] TheCommieDuck: And it's about a second for the other 109 together, or as fast as the console will output.
[2013-07-15 07:41:14] TheCommieDuck: jimevans: I'll try this and .text and return. I am pretty sure it did with FF too.

[2013-07-15 07:45:58] TheCommieDuck: jimevans: I'm not sure what you mean. I'm waiting for a search results table to load and then going through each page of results. I'd expect that if I load page 1, wait for the table to load, then load page 2, I'd be waiting for the page 2 table to load

[2013-07-15 08:21:54] TheCommieDuck: jimevans: Ah, okay. I'll try waiting on the table elements (I presume that's possible, somehow?)

[2013-07-15 09:21:04] Prometheian: Yes to any language?
[2013-07-15 09:21:13] TheCommieDuck: jimevans: Should I presume that that will use the default timeout property?
[2013-07-15 09:21:14] Todd: Yes to any language.
[2013-07-15 09:21:35] Todd: Prometheian: this is a good starting point: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp
[2013-07-15 09:21:36] lukeis: they all speak the same communication protocol (http)
[2013-07-15 09:21:38] Prometheian: Thank you very much Todd
[2013-07-15 09:22:15] Prometheian: I already have some tests, some that run in a NUnit application, and some that run in Eclipse as JUnit tests.
[2013-07-15 09:22:30] Prometheian: But I want to move them to Selenium Grid. So that's going to be an adventure.
[2013-07-15 09:22:48] Todd: Prometheian: How so? If you're using webdriver already it should be simple.

[2013-07-15 09:25:30] Todd: Prometheian: I had to search for NUnit. It appears to be a unit-testing framework for .Net. I don't know anything about .Net as I'm a linux guy. There are things like mono but I'm unfamiliar.
[2013-07-15 09:26:00] Prometheian: Okay. Chances are I'll have to recode the C# tests into Java, but that shouldn't be hard. Thank you very much. :)
[2013-07-15 09:26:17] Todd: Prometheian: you're welcome
[2013-07-15 09:26:26] jimevans: Prometheian: nunit will work under mono, but there may be some issues with certain parts of the .net bindings
[2013-07-15 09:26:47] Prometheian: My supervisor said he tried a quick port to mono but ran into issues.

[2013-07-15 09:27:03] jimevans: the firefox driver in particular is problematic
[2013-07-15 09:30:06] Prometheian: Yeah, they run in FF 3.8.
[2013-07-15 09:30:13] Prometheian: Like, what the hell...
[2013-07-15 09:31:26] jimevans: the reason is that the current .net firefox driver implementation works using the DotNetZip library for unzipping the webdriver firefox extension and installing it into the anonymous profile. that library has a bug making it not cross-platform.
[2013-07-15 09:31:29] tourdedave, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-15 09:32:19] Prometheian: Well, I was thinking of moving it all to Ruby but since I have far more Java experience, and most of the tests we run are in Java, I'll just keep it as java.
[2013-07-15 09:32:30] jimevans: however, there's nothing to say that you can't use RemoteWebDriver along with the java webdriver server to execute the tests on windows driving the browser on a remote linux machine.

[2013-07-15 09:39:04] Todd: The grid hub accepts 'commands' over http as lukeis said earlier.

[2013-07-15 09:49:57] jimevans: in a browser, javascript is executed on the UI thread. anything that blocks the UI thread, like, say, an alert or other modal dialog, will also block javascript execution.
[2013-07-15 09:50:19] jimevans: brotspinne: why not use the advanced user interactions api? that's exactly what it's supposed to be used for.

[2013-07-15 11:30:43] jimevans: Prometheian: my words were very carefully chosen. selenium IDE has a language ("selenese") as its native format for saving script files, but it's not turing complete, and lacks several constructs that most people would associate with a programming language.

[2013-07-15 12:43:33] jimevans: Chirishman_: what language are you working in? (assuming you're not trying to record/playback with Selenium IDE; if you are I won't help you)
[2013-07-15 12:44:39] Chirishman_: i recorded it with the IDE because that seemed the simplest way to do it but my goal is to call whatever my end product is from my existing batch script ping monitor which notifies my by GROWL if something goes down

[2013-07-15 12:47:31] jimevans: so if you'd exported your script from IDE to a programming language (java, c#, ruby, python, etc.), be in a better position. then you'd just need the java standalone server. of course, if you were using webdriver, it'd be even easier in terms of what you needed to download. but i'm (purposefully, willfully, and stubbornly) ignorant of IDE.

[2013-07-15 12:53:54] jimevans: Chirishman_: okay, then you need the selenium standalone server, which should include all of the dependencies you need. remember though, that you'll also need a way to compile your java code into an executable unit (probably by packaging it into a .jar yourself), which can then be executed on the command line.

[2013-07-15 12:57:01] Chirishman_: i haven't done much with java and what I did was a few years ago but I can probably figure that out again. The standalone server would be the "selenium-server-standalone-2.33.0.jar" that I downloaded right?

[2013-07-15 12:58:53] Chirishman_: Once I've compiled these though I need to deploy them on a different box, an old Win Server 2k3 machine. What do I need to put onto that? The server standalone, my compiled jar of my script, anything else?

[2013-07-15 13:01:26] jimevans: the full name is "selenium webdriver"
[2013-07-15 13:01:54] jimevans: compare and contrast to "selenium rc", a different selenium api which is older, and been deprecated.

[2013-07-15 13:07:33] Prometheian: Should be, I'll double check.
[2013-07-15 13:08:08] jimevans: because i'd never put it there on my system; i'd put it somewhere i can actually find it.

[2013-07-15 13:08:41] Prometheian: Yup, it's there.
[2013-07-15 13:08:52] Chirishman_: right but JAR of the script containing the actions depends on the server JAR right?
[2013-07-15 13:08:53] Prometheian: I'm working with a system that someone setup a while back, and who no longer works here.
[2013-07-15 13:09:10] Prometheian: And his supervisor also no longer works here.
[2013-07-15 13:09:13] jimevans: Chirishman_: normally yes.
[2013-07-15 13:09:25] Prometheian: So I'm trying to walk myself through this very, very carefully.
[2013-07-15 13:09:49] jimevans: Prometheian: so? it really really doesn't matter *where* chromedriver.exe is.
[2013-07-15 13:09:57] jimevans: as long as your code can find it.
[2013-07-15 13:10:04] Prometheian: Yeah, I know. It's pointed correctly.
[2013-07-15 13:10:31] Prometheian: I have no idea why it thinks it isn't.
[2013-07-15 13:11:20] Chirishman_: so if i do something like start /d "C:\Program Files\FakeDirectory" testcase.jar it will fail because the server isn't running
[2013-07-15 13:11:38] zx29b, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-15 13:12:12] jimevans: Chirishman_: if you're using webdriver, there shouldn't be any need to "start up a server" if all you're doing is running locally.
[2013-07-15 13:14:08] Chirishman_: so instead of hooking into the standaloneserver.jar it will hook into the iedriverserver.exe but will find the default path of that automatically?

[2013-07-15 13:30:59] Chirishman_: i'm just trying to figure out how the scripts exported from the IDE could ever work for more than a single iteration of the standalone
