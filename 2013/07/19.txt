[2013-07-19 03:46:55] Unode: hi everyone. I'm running selenium using python bindings, firefox webdriver and Xvfb without a window manager.
[2013-07-19 03:47:57] Unode: I'm currently trying to find a way of maximizing the firefox window to fit the resolution of Xvfb (i.e. maximize window) but using the maximize_window() method I am not seeing any difference
[2013-07-19 03:48:45] Unode: are there any known problems concerning this particular method/action?
[2013-07-19 03:49:04] p_l: Unode: Firefox can't maximize itself without window manager
[2013-07-19 03:49:43] Unode: are there any alternatives?
[2013-07-19 03:50:12] Unode: I could use a lightweight window manager, but sounds a bit absurd since I only want to scale up the window
[2013-07-19 03:51:05] p_l: Unode: you can see if firefox accepts standard X11 -geometry argument, or some alternative to it
[2013-07-19 03:51:28] p_l: "maximize" is a window menager action for various reasons
[2013-07-19 03:51:58] Unode: ok
[2013-07-19 03:52:24] Unode: thanks
[2013-07-19 03:52:55] p_l: (mostly that applications don't know the geometry to maximize themselves to - unless they implement a WM themselves, they have at best the sizes of root window, which in real world use isn't that good)

[2013-07-19 04:01:34] Unode: p_l seems like using set_window_size() and set_window_position() work without a WM. Since I know the resolution of the screen I can use this as alternative
[2013-07-19 04:02:55] p_l: Unode: those are essentially direct manipulation of geometry, that's why they work. "Maximize" doesn't, because it requires WM to set correct bounds not to overlap whatever is considered "non-overlapping", like taskbar etc.

[2013-07-19 09:12:15] qaguy: brockfredin: switch to

[2013-07-19 09:14:44] qaguy: Yea its really weird. I get all the window handles.handles[0] is parent and handles[1] is pop-up. I switch to 1 do my work then return to 0. Works perfect in chrome.
[2013-07-19 09:15:04] Dude-X: qaguy: don't assume that the first one is parent
[2013-07-19 09:15:04] qaguy: but seems FF thinks 0 is no longer open
[2013-07-19 09:15:17] qaguy: Its always parent
[2013-07-19 09:15:18] Dude-X: the proper way to switch is parent = current window,

[2013-07-19 09:15:46] qaguy: Because its the window in focus
[2013-07-19 09:15:51] qaguy: ie the one you are on
[2013-07-19 09:18:12] Dude-X: my window switching code is parent = currentWindow, windows = getwindowHandles, for window in windows: if not parent: switch to Window
[2013-07-19 09:18:53] qaguy: Yea mine is very similar.
[2013-07-19 09:19:30] Dude-X: then i would add "wait for window to appear" code
[2013-07-19 09:19:50] qaguy: Dude-X: ok gonna try that. Thanks.
[2013-07-19 09:20:39] Dude-X: it may be argued that there is a bug in the code
