[2013-07-08 07:37:50] adamgoucher: i've actually been on a plane landing at sfo that did the 'holy fuck! we should try this again' loop -- successfully
[2013-07-08 07:39:10] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: one of the UK Mozillians had a similar situation
[2013-07-08 07:39:10] jimevans: Ardesco: that does help, thanks. :)
[2013-07-08 07:39:11] Ardesco: that'll be the time the pilot has to make a landing rather than the machine
[2013-07-08 07:39:41] Ardesco: they don't get much practice nowadays ;P
[2013-07-08 07:40:00] AutomatedTester: "The plane on the runway isn't clearing quickly enough so we need to go around again" *hears frantic beeping and pilot pulls up sharply*
[2013-07-08 07:41:38] adamgoucher: we didnt get any warning, just the nose suddenly at like 60 degrees or something crazy. 'sorry about that, we're just going to try this approach again'
[2013-07-08 07:42:19] Ardesco: could have been worse, it could have been
[2013-07-08 07:42:41] Ardesco: Sorry about that, I dropped a contact.  Just going round again while I scrabble about on the cockpit floor trying to find it
[2013-07-08 07:43:15] Oscar_Rieken: i take it none of you guys have ever been in the service lol, When I was in the corps taking Military flights from base to base were all like that. about to land and then have to pull up and try again

[2013-07-08 07:46:13] Ardesco: but to be fair, i'm sure UK troops have made mistakes the other way as well
[2013-07-08 07:46:20] Ardesco: they got through to them in the end

[2013-07-08 09:34:42] jawr: so to detect a 404 or 500 you just have to assert that an element you were expecting isn't there?
[2013-07-08 09:34:56] dimacus: sure… or just let the test keep going
[2013-07-08 09:35:09] dimacus: if you tell it to click on purchase link but it's 404 the link wont be there

[2013-07-08 09:35:38] jawr: seems quite fun, just started playing with it today
[2013-07-08 09:36:00] jawr: how does IE work, i assume you need to be running windows and it will pick up iexplorer.exe?
[2013-07-08 09:36:08] jawr: no way to linuxify it?
[2013-07-08 09:36:10] stackedsax, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-08 09:36:24] jimevans: jawr: no supported way, no.
[2013-07-08 09:36:27] dimacus: or you can do what i do, and have a windows vm
[2013-07-08 09:36:39] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-08 09:36:40] jawr: yeah, can always fall back to a linux vm
[2013-07-08 09:36:56] jawr: one for each version i guess
[2013-07-08 09:37:23] jimevans: and if you try it (running on linux, or running multiple versions of IE in a single windows installation), and come to me with a bug (and you will, i'm nearly certain of it), i'll reject it out of hand.
[2013-07-08 09:37:25] mdgreenfield, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-08 09:37:50] jawr: so the accepted method is, 1 windows vm per ie version
[2013-07-08 09:38:03] dimacus: well
[2013-07-08 09:38:18] jimevans: it's the only way you can be guaranteed that the browser itself is in a Microsoft-supported configuration, yes.
[2013-07-08 09:38:25] jawr: fair enough
[2013-07-08 09:38:36] dimacus: my aproach is simpler
[2013-07-08 09:38:49] dimacus: look at your site's logs and see what the most popular version of IE used
[2013-07-08 09:38:52] dimacus: and test on that
[2013-07-08 09:38:59] dimacus: currently ie8 for me
[2013-07-08 09:39:01] whhone_, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-08 09:39:09] dimacus: like 80% are using ie8
[2013-07-08 09:39:26] jimevans: dimacus: and if it's IE6, shoot your users, because the IE driver won't work with IE6 after April 2014?

[2013-07-08 09:40:51] jawr: so a lot of useful metrics like that are not really available/recorded
[2013-07-08 09:41:06] dimacus: is it internal or external app?
[2013-07-08 09:41:06] jawr: generally it's 7/8/9/safari afaik
[2013-07-08 09:41:11] jawr: depends on the client
[2013-07-08 09:41:13] jawr: can be either
[2013-07-08 09:41:22] jawr: a lot of users do just have it on a lan though
[2013-07-08 09:41:22] dimacus: gotcha… then just go by industry
[2013-07-08 09:41:35] dimacus: i think ie8 is dominant
[2013-07-08 09:41:45] Oscar_Rieken: and currently I am not seeing iedriverserver as a limiting factor on how many instances of the browser you throw up on that vm
[2013-07-08 09:41:46] jawr: well, we need to cater for all, i don't mind having to do it
[2013-07-08 09:41:48] dimacus: so stick to that, you will chase your tail a lot for edge cases on ie6
