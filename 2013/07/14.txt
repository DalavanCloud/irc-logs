[2013-07-14 06:44:17] zwieback86, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-14 06:51:03] zwieback86: Hello all! Maybe someone can help me with my question regarding selenium and http-requests: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17639299/browser-simulation-and-scraping-with-windmill-or-selenium-how-many-http-request
[2013-07-14 06:54:10] Dude-X_: zwieback86: how complicated is the website
[2013-07-14 06:55:47] zwieback86: we can assume its not complicated let me find an example, though im interested in a general answer
[2013-07-14 06:56:12] zwieback86: or lets for example just take google
[2013-07-14 06:56:17] Dude-X_: well using requests would only return the initial state of a webpage
[2013-07-14 06:56:42] Dude-X_: if the links are dynamically generated, then requests won't be able to execute the javascript that executes the links
[2013-07-14 06:56:51] Parabola, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-07-14 06:57:13] zwieback86: lets assume they are not dynamically generated
[2013-07-14 06:57:15] Dude-X_: selenium can give you a dump of the DOM, and thus all live links that exist
[2013-07-14 06:57:29] Dude-X_: you can use driver.page_source to get a text dump of the DOM
[2013-07-14 06:57:46] zwieback86: so its possible with just one http request?
[2013-07-14 06:57:56] Dude-X_: it's not really an HTTP request per se
[2013-07-14 06:58:02] Dude-X_: it's whatever the state of the browser
[2013-07-14 06:58:40] Dude-X_: you can do something like links = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector('a[href]')
[2013-07-14 06:58:44] Dude-X_: and then process the links
[2013-07-14 06:59:01] Dude-X_: using selenium
[2013-07-14 06:59:21] zwieback86: ok so when i want the browser to go to google for example and search for a query, after the search request has been send and displayed in the browser i can work with driver.find_elements without processing another request
[2013-07-14 06:59:26] Dude-X_: or do source = driver.page_source and then using a lot of text processing to extract the links
[2013-07-14 06:59:35] Dude-X_: that's right
[2013-07-14 06:59:50] zwieback86: thanks alot, that really helps me!
[2013-07-14 06:59:50] Dude-X_: i suppose if you can work with GET/POST you can avoid using selenium
[2013-07-14 07:00:05] Dude-X_: but if you can't then selenium will get the job done, but slowly
[2013-07-14 07:00:46] zwieback86: but i want that when i get the links and analyse them, that the browser is still running and waiting for next action
[2013-07-14 07:00:56] Dude-X_: yes
[2013-07-14 07:01:43] zwieback86: thank you alot!
[2013-07-14 07:02:13] zwieback86: i was just curious if for the scraping part, selenium would send another request
[2013-07-14 07:04:06] SamuraiJack_, quitting. (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[2013-07-14 07:04:07] Dude-X_: working with selenium is mostly synchronous
[2013-07-14 07:04:38] Dude-X_: so if you're concerned about speed, then take advantage of threads for IO or processes for splitting up work
[2013-07-14 07:06:36] zwieback86: im not that concerned about speed, just about how many requests i send to the webpage: so visiting the site is 1 i guess, then i scrape the links analyze them and say the browser to click on the found link, so i send in total 2 requests? is that right?
[2013-07-14 07:07:11] Dude-X_: yeah
[2013-07-14 07:08:24] zwieback86: thanks that was really helpful, you know i thought for visiting and then scraping, it could be possible that selenium sends more requests
[2013-07-14 07:09:12] Dude-X_: it only interacts with the web page
[2013-07-14 07:09:32] Dude-X_: behind the scenes it is making http calls to the extension in the browser
[2013-07-14 07:09:47] Dude-X_: but the browser will only respond to your commands
[2013-07-14 07:10:09] Dude-X_: so it won't make any more http requests after the page is fully loaded
[2013-07-14 07:10:15] Dude-X_: or there is a timer in the page
[2013-07-14 07:11:43] zwieback86: oh ok, yeah i mean those http calls that i cannot see, so for getting the links selenium has to communicate with the website again, after it was fully loaded?
[2013-07-14 07:14:05] Dude-X_: it communicates onlu with the browser
[2013-07-14 07:14:34] Dude-X_: it will only make additional calls from your machine to the site only if you click on something, trigger an ajax event, or load another page altogether
[2013-07-14 07:21:03] zwieback86: ok i think now its really clear, thx. i will test that with zonealarm maybe
