[00:00:20] harly: sure i see. but i was going through the menus to add an sdk and couldn't find any jdk. i think it's simply that i haven't installed a jdk lol. doing that now
[00:00:54] p_l: harly: you'll find the menu when you enter "project settings", iirc
[00:01:09] p_l: it's not in configuration, but after creating a project :)
[00:01:32] harly: yep. there's an option to add one. and it gives a basic directory navigation. google tells me to find the jdk folder. which i can't find because. i'm sucky. :)
[00:05:05] harly: ok jdk setup.
[00:05:25] harly: ooh exciting. almost at hello world.
[00:26:48] jost has joined #selenium
[00:26:56] harly: p_l: ok i got the example working. cheers for the help.
[00:27:39] harly: and by god java is verbose. maybe I will look at python instead hah
[00:38:01] kaawee: Hello! Are the symbols of the IEDriverServer available? It looks like I got it to crash.
[00:41:38] sayd has joined #selenium
[00:41:54] sayd: anyone using selenium builder know how to convert runScript to work with python?
[00:42:22] sayd: i guess in order for a python export to work the tests have to be in selenium 1 format 
[00:45:46] jost has joined #selenium
[00:54:33] harly: my next question: now that I have a web driver test written. how can I send that to multiple vms running different browsers?
[00:55:22] jost: harly, first, start a selenium server on some machine.
[00:55:37] harly: ok. i'll get that started on a windows 7 vm.
[00:55:54] jost: as a hub where all other nodes connect to
[00:56:11] harly: and i'll google those terms haha
[00:56:16] jost: "java -jar selenium-server-standalone-<version>.jar -role hub" should do it
[00:56:29] stephend: harly: our setup is in python, if you're interested in it
[00:56:47] harly: who is "our" and what is the setup?
[00:56:51] stephend: Mozilla
[00:57:14] stephend: https://github.com/davehunt/pytest-mozwebqa is a plugin we've written
[00:57:22] harly: so I could setup my ide in a unix env with python, and run it on windows servers?
[00:57:40] harly: jost: ok i'll run that.
[00:57:55] stephend: it's used if you want to run Grid
[00:58:03] jost: harly: the architecture is as follows: one instance of selenium-server acts as a hub, all test cases are sent to that one. Then other machines (nodes) connect to that server, and get the test cases to run from it
[00:58:10] stephend: well, not just, but primarily
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Jan 17 01:01:20 2013]
[01:01:20] harly: jost: ok so I want to set up my ide vm as the hub. and other vms i want to set up as nodes. but my question then is. if I run the command you gave me on my ide machine. how does it know what tetss to run?
[01:01:34] harly: and of course the follow up question is, how do I tell the test vms to register with the hub.
[01:03:05] jost: harly, first the registering of the nodes. It looks somehow like this: http://pastebin.com/ugPSG5wJ
[01:03:31] jost: you can add more browsers if you like
[01:04:09] harly: i see.
[01:05:00] jost: you should add a port to your host URL, by default the port is 4444
[01:05:03] mreedell has joined #selenium
[01:06:38] jost: To run the test, you need to use an instance of the "RemoteWebDriver", with the hub-URL and the desired browser as parameters
[01:07:00] jost: you can find out the details in the API
[01:07:01] harly: oh hmm.  the "hello world" test i setup does new FireFoxDriver();  presumably there is a way to make that generic? new Browser() or something?
[01:09:11] jost: "new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://huburl:4444/wd/hub"), desiredCapabilities);" - the desiredCapabilities tell which browser, OS, browser version etc. you want. The hub then finds an unoccupied node matching these requirements and runs the tests on that.
[01:09:46] harly: i see. i'll go read up on those apis.

[01:38:42] be has joined #selenium
[01:55:42] harly: some questions while i'm waiting for stuff to install:
[01:56:06] harly: if I have VM (a) registered with chrome and firefox. can it run simultaneous tests on both, or just 1 at a time?
[01:56:11] mreedell has joined #selenium
[01:56:25] jost: simultaneous
[01:56:54] jost: you could even run multiple tests with each browser at the same time
[01:57:01] harly: ok. and 1 at a time per browser, or even multiple tests p.... ok you beat me to it.
[01:57:26] harly: so the focus of VMs then should be OS, and browser versions
[01:58:21] jost: yes... but some browser probably won't work with multiple instances in parallel
[01:58:26] jost: (IE)
[01:58:49] harly: ok. and cookies would interfere as well. so then, the other reason is massive parallel testing.
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Jan 17 02:00:02 2013]
[02:00:02] jost: I believe in Firefox, Opera and chrome, cookies won't interfere, because each session uses its own profile
[02:00:11] jost: but I'm not sure
[02:00:53] harly: i'm not sure either. but I nkow if I have a new chrome window it will have my cookies from other windows. it remembers my facebook and google logins for example. and if I logout in one window it logs out in the others.
[02:01:36] jost: But you are using the same profile in all of them when doing this manually
[02:02:04] jost: I think webdriver uses different profiles, which don't interfere with each other
[02:02:18] harly: ah i see. i was referring to manual windows.
[02:02:27] jost: probably trying is the best thing to do
[02:02:31] harly: yep
[02:04:28] jost: You'll need to call quit() on the driver after each test case, to make multiple instances work
[02:05:01] harly: ok. well for now that is advanced. i'm first working towards a test running on multiple vms. 
[02:05:47] harly: on the client vms, do I just install selenium server?
[02:06:01] harly: or standalone?
[02:06:01] KebabBob has joined #selenium
[02:06:09] harly: the ones that will connect to the hub.
[02:06:22] jost: standalone is the thing i use, i think
[02:07:06] jost: it is
[02:07:10] harly: ok

[02:57:01] harly: when i set capabilities.InternetExplorer or chrome it gives some driver errors.
[02:57:47] harly: looks like it needs some additional downloads for those two.
[02:59:09] harly: oh i lost jost. boo :)

[10:21:37] Steven__: hello folks
[10:21:55] Steven__: I'm trying to use selenium with the internet explorer driver
[10:21:56] simonstewart: hi
[10:22:11] krosenvold_: :note selbot2_ can you talk to yourself ?
[10:22:11] *selbot2_ looks the other way
[10:22:14] Steven__: when I visit some page that (for some reason) stalls IE, selenium will happily wait forever
[10:22:39] Steven__: is there a way to place a timeout on this?
[10:23:01] dawagner has joined #selenium
[10:23:02] selbot2_: dawagner: note from simonstewart about 1 hour ago: I have no idea what superpacking is, but krosenvold_ does 
[10:23:03] Steven__: actually, I realise that this case is specific to IE :) I know there are lots of timeouts in selenium that I can set
[10:23:07] Steven__: but none of them seem to work
[10:23:30] dawagner: krosenvold_: ^^?
[10:23:35] Steven__: I have to resort to a background script that kills iexplore.exe after a minute or so, just to make sure selenium will detect that IE failed
[10:23:59] simonstewart: Steven__: Is there a shareable example test case that demonstrates the problem
[10:24:27] Steven__: simonstewart: I can copy paste the python script I use
[10:24:40] simonstewart: Can someone not on your network reach the page?
[10:25:02] simonstewart: (I  don't have access to a windows machine, so this is just trying to get enough information out there for Someone Else to help you)
[10:25:48] Steven__: ah
[10:26:07] Steven__: I'm trying a public website, that for some reason seems to hang IE :)
[10:26:12] Steven__: http://www.standaard.be
[10:26:13] girija has left #selenium
[10:26:15] simonstewart: Public site is good
[10:26:31] simonstewart: And just doing a "get" on that causes IE to hang?
[10:27:01] Steven__: yes
[10:27:04] Steven__: http://pastebin.com/d7pHDL6n
[10:27:11] Steven__: get() seems to wait until the page is loaded
[10:27:19] Steven__: but IE never finishes loading
[10:27:20] simonstewart: :newissue
[10:27:20] selbot2_: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/entry
[10:27:24] simonstewart: This is perfect
[10:27:34] Steven__: perfect? :)
[10:27:43] Steven__: oh
[10:27:44] simonstewart: A reproducible test case
[10:27:56] simonstewart: On a public site which one of the devs can access
[10:28:15] Steven__: I've created a script to turn a standard winXP installation CD into an unattended installer for a selenium grid with IE driver
[10:28:27] Steven__: since I hate doing monkey work on windows
[10:28:31] simonstewart: Heh :)
[10:28:37] Steven__: maybe I should put that online somewhere, might be useful to someone
[10:28:51] simonstewart: One of my first gigs was helping to set up the remote deploys of Windows
[10:30:05] Steven__: I did some unattended installs before too
[10:30:05] simonstewart: Seen Sauce?
[10:30:08] Steven__: with rdesktop :)
[10:30:23] Steven__: actually
[10:30:39] dawagner: simonstewart: https://codereview.chromium.org/11968015/
[10:30:48] Steven__: I've been playing with an alternative setup to use IE, by using rdesktop to start a VBscript on a windows host, which spawns IE and does what I want
[10:31:16] simonstewart: The End of Chrome
[10:31:25] Steven__: is there a reason why selenium does not use a vbscript on the remote windows machine to do the IE-stuff, instead of the IE Webdriver?

[10:43:12] barancev: which IEDriverServer version do you use? which selenium version?
[10:44:08] barancev: try to run using InternetExplorerDriver directly, without selenium server to make sore it is IE-related issue, not the network
[10:46:36] freynaud has joined #selenium
[10:48:09] Steven__: barancev: I use selenium 2.28.0, and latest IEDriver, and MSIE 8 on XP
[10:48:45] Steven__: I'll try without selenium
[10:49:11] barancev: I've checked with IE9 on Win7, will try IE8 on XP sauce based, and you'd try without server
[10:49:49] Steven__: if I try without selenium, the page hangs too
[10:49:52] Steven__: and I know it does :P
[10:50:00] Steven__: the problem is that I can't shut it down from selenium

[10:50:25] Steven__: selenium just keeps waiting for the page to load, but IE never finishes loading
[10:50:53] miguel: I have found the object DummyLogger in the Selenium IDE.
[10:51:49] miguel: how to send this log to the file?
[10:52:28] barancev: Steven__: aha, that's what I missed the page hangs, I can't see this in IE9
[10:52:51] Steven__: barancev: ah
[10:52:56] Steven__: so it's IE8 related
[10:53:05] Steven__: thats good to know :)
[10:53:19] Steven__: but still, it would be nice to detect that the page hangs, from selenium
[10:53:45] Steven__: I wanted to debug this myself, but I have no idea where this functionality should be added
[10:53:57] Steven__: is it an IE driver issue?

[10:55:01] krosenvold_: dawagner: It's the basic repack of the repo with all the aggressive settings. I half-assume google code does this already
[10:56:26] krosenvold_: The thing is when I pushed, I had to do it in small packs
[10:56:41] krosenvold_: And they should have a big pack ;)
[10:57:23] krosenvold_: dawagner: Btw I now longer haz all da stars. Thanks to the guys ;)

[11:00:12] dawagner: Woo!
[11:00:56] krosenvold_: dawagner: repack something like this: 	git repack -a -d --depth=250 --window=250
[11:01:40] barancev: Steven__: I could not reproduce it on IE8+XP too: https://saucelabs.com/tests/a514ab56b0444563af948e047d4ea4a9
[11:01:42] dawagner: krosenvold_: I suspect they already do whatever is necessary behind the scenes (their git does Interesting Things), but I'll run it past them :)
[11:01:43] krosenvold_: Maybe with git reflog expire --expire=now --all first
[11:02:00] krosenvold_: dawagner: That trepack operation is pretty cpu intensive
[11:02:40] barancev: Steven__: do you have any plugins to IE that can cause there hangs, not the site itself?
[11:03:00] krosenvold_: I suspect even google will be hard-pressed to that by default to do that all the time

[11:20:42] simonstewart: That'll take _forever_
[11:20:44] Steven__: quick question
[11:20:48] simonstewart: :ask

[11:20:51] Steven__: I can use -nodePolling with selenium
[11:20:57] dawagner: No, it updates then cleans
[11:21:15] krosenvold_: dawagner: Yes, but git remote add will prolly fail the second time around.
[11:21:18] Steven__: when I do: -nodePolling 5000, I get an error with stacktrace: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The 'nodePolling' argument must be a positive integer.
[11:21:27] krosenvold_: dawagner: The ci is on push hook, I assume ?
[11:21:27] Steven__: what argument does -nodePolling expect?
[11:21:35] dawagner: The CI polls
[11:22:12] krosenvold_: Maybe it would be a better idea to solve goooglecode->jenkins push notifications...
[11:22:12] dawagner: We can live with it failing and acting as a no-op :)
[11:22:18] krosenvold_: dawagner: Polling is ok
[11:22:19] dawagner: Yeah, we can do that
[11:22:38] krosenvold_: But the push from google code to jenkins probably exists somewhere already...?

[11:31:52] Steven__: bbiab
[11:37:47] freynaud: Steven__: can you file a bug for that ? In the meantime, you can work around the issue by specifying the nodePolling value when you start the node. 
[11:42:01] simonstewart: freynaud: I think that's what he's struggling with: how does he specify that value when starting the node?
[11:45:01] freynaud: simonstewart: no, he's setting it on the hub, making the value the default for all node not specifying it. The default are probably cast as string by default. If he specifies it on the node instead, bypassing the default value, he can get around the issue. I just tried locally.
[11:45:12] simonstewart: ok

[12:56:44] Michael_Wowro: Hi there
[12:56:49] Michael_Wowro: I think TestNG is mostly used in Selenium-based projects. Anyhow if you need to communicate with some non-programmers in a project, acceptance test frameworks seem to be a better way. Do you have any experience with the scaling of acceptance-test-frameworks in Selenium-based project? FitNesse for example doesn't have a out-of-the-box support for parallelization which make your test-suite run...
[12:56:50] Michael_Wowro: ...to long with testing several browsers ...
[12:57:21] simonstewart: Michael_Wowro: I always just used junit
[12:57:37] simonstewart: And something like Agiledox to sort out explaining what was going on to non-devs
[12:58:01] Michael_Wowro: oh ok. thanks - I'll have a look

[16:23:19] lukeis: no worries jimevans
[16:23:22] Ardesco: no element not present is when you try to find it
[16:23:30] Ardesco: stale element is if the element has been recreated
[16:23:37] seltest: well, isn't that what find does
[16:23:39] Ardesco: and element not attached to dom is if it's gone
[16:23:41] Ardesco: i think
[16:24:18] seltest: Ardesco: sorry, i don't understand -- you think "find element" throws the "stale exception"?
[16:24:27] Ardesco: just reading back
[16:24:49] lukeis: it could throw, if the find was from the webelement and not the webdriver ;)
[16:24:50] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: if you can't see the text, then that might be differenet
[16:24:51] Ardesco: and would expect you to be seeing a element not present
[16:25:05] Ardesco: :)
[16:25:17] Ardesco: but then i'm used to have exceptions
[16:25:23] Ardesco: maybe python ones are different\
[16:25:34] seltest: nah, they're the same
[16:25:34] lukeis: not very different
[16:25:52] seltest: i am a bit lost how that line can throw "DOM changed"
[16:25:58] seltest: don't know where to start looking for problems
[16:26:02] seltest: hard to debug :(
[16:27:42] Ardesco: dom changed between you finding the element and requesting the text?
[16:27:56] Ardesco: which would be pretty unlucky tbh
[16:28:01] Ardesco: because that's got to be ms
[16:28:04] seltest: hmm, can that happen?
[16:28:08] lukeis: seltest: if there's javascript updating the page, or you just landed on the page and didn't 'wait for it to load' (in some cases) then you are in a mini race condition where you find the 'results' but then the next command that DOM element is gone
[16:28:27] lukeis: Ardesco: it happens when pages are loading ;)

[16:29:52] Ardesco: i did say something like this
[16:30:53] *Ardesco sticks * around like
[16:31:02] Osleg: WaitForElementPresent couldn't work in this case?
[16:31:09] seltest: lukeis: how to wait for an element to be "finished loading"? i thought that find() waits anyhow

[16:31:30] lukeis: seltest: find does not wait
[16:31:54] seltest: pretty sure i read about implicit wait somewhere
[16:32:05] lukeis: it doesn't wait if the element is found
[16:32:27] seltest: so how to wait when an element is found, but its `text` is not yet available?
[16:32:46] Ardesco: well text will always be available
[16:32:51] lukeis: imagine you are on a page that has an element with class='results' and you are trying to find an element with class='results' after you clicked something on the that page
[16:32:54] Ardesco: but if the text changes after the element is created
[16:32:57] Ardesco: that's a rpoblem
[16:33:20] *lukeis needs to see your test and page to be more helpful on how to wait
[16:33:43] lukeis: likely i would do a stalenessOf element after the click / before that find
[16:33:49] seltest: lukeis: it's an internal site, but i still don't see how find().text can throw "DOM changed"
[16:33:50] lukeis: webdriverwait
[16:33:59] lukeis: find doesn't
[16:34:03] lukeis: the .text does
[16:34:24] seltest: aha, good, now we moved somewhere :)
[16:34:26] lukeis: browsers are 'fast' :)
[16:34:32] seltest: so how do i find+text atomically?
[16:34:39] lukeis: you can't
[16:34:52] Osleg: seltest: WebDriverWait(driver, 15).until(lambda driver: driver.find_element_by_class("result")) < this is how you wait, but as lukeis said - it might be not helpfull in your case
[16:34:53] andreastt: lukeis: Not my experience testing them (-;
[16:35:14] seltest: i know how to wait, thanks
[16:35:18] lukeis: andreastt: yeah ;)
[16:35:32] seltest: the element is there, or else find wouldn't find it
[16:35:35] lukeis: seltest: what is the command BEFORE your find.text
[16:35:42] andreastt: Takes over a day, close to two, to run all of our browser tests on one test node.
[16:36:12] Osleg: seltest: did you try to sleep(0.5) maybe?
[16:36:17] lukeis: noooooo ;)
[16:36:21] seltest: no, but i may have to :(
[16:36:26] lukeis: noooooo
[16:36:38] Ardesco: lets start at the beginning
[16:36:38] lukeis: there's a condition to wait for
[16:36:49] Ardesco: is there javascript on the page that is adding text to elements
[16:36:50] stephend has joined #selenium
[16:37:12] *lukeis still trying to get the webdriver command he calls before driver.find(…).text
[16:37:15] samphippen has joined #selenium
[16:37:17] seltest: yes, the "result" element is filled dynamically
[16:37:33] Osleg: seltest: maybe you can show a corresponding part of page's source?
[16:37:35] Ardesco: are you using any js libraries
[16:37:49] seltest: Osleg: ok, sec
[16:38:13] Ardesco: \notify lukeis bet he says yes, jQuery
[16:38:29] Ardesco: :)
[16:39:26] lukeis: if this happens all the time (every time) then you can do:  WebDriverWait(driver, 5).until(ExpectedConditions.stalenessOf(driver.find_element_by_class_name("results")))   and then continue on your merry way
[16:39:40] lukeis: s/stalenessOf/staleness_of/
[16:40:51] lukeis: Ardesco: /me still waiting on your Pull Requests ;)
[16:40:53] Ardesco: but what if the staleness occurs before he gets the wait command off
[16:40:57] Ardesco: he has another race condition
[16:41:00] lukeis: yep
[16:41:26] Ardesco: I know i need to do something useful, spare time is being eaten up by DIY demands atm
[16:41:28] lukeis: which is why i would normally do the find in that staleness_of  BEFORE the previous command, which I'm going to assume is a click
[16:42:03] dude-x has joined #selenium
[16:42:06] Ardesco: in fact more DINH than DIY
[16:42:18] Ardesco: (Do It Now Husband!)
[16:42:23] lukeis: ha
[16:42:29] *AutomatedTester doesnt understand some visibility checks
[16:42:32] seltest: ok it's just <div id="some-id"><ul class="results">...</ul></div>, and the entire div is replaced via $('#some-id').html(html)
[16:42:43] Ardesco: which is jquery
[16:42:45] lukeis: dammit Ardesco
[16:42:45] seltest: in an ajax call
[16:42:48] Ardesco: so use the gist i supplied
[16:42:48] lukeis: you were right
[16:42:57] Ardesco: that waits for jQuery to finish processing
[16:43:00] lukeis: except he's using python ;)
[16:43:09] Ardesco: convert it to pythoin
[16:43:28] seltest: sos the "return jQuery.active === 0;" will take care of the find vs. text race?
[16:43:35] Ardesco: the only important bit is return jQuery.active === 0;
[16:43:46] Ardesco: yup
[16:44:04] Ardesco: query sets active to 0 when it has finished manipulating elements on screen
[16:44:13] lukeis: updated the gist with a comment https://gist.github.com/4435098
[16:44:14] Ardesco: *jQuery
[16:44:26] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[16:45:16] *lukeis likes how much less code it is to do that in python than java ;)
[16:45:35] Osleg: ^ this
[16:45:35] seltest: so i basically have to call that before every call to webdriver, because jquery can be running at any time
[16:45:37] seltest: via timers etc?
[16:45:43] rbalent has joined #selenium
[16:46:32] Ardesco: hah that's not even Java , that's groovy
[16:46:37] Ardesco: you should see the Java version...
[16:46:57] cgoldberg: lukeis, lambdas are ugly.. but still concise and tiny in comparison to the ball-and-Java
[16:47:22] Ardesco: that has proper casts and returns an everything
[16:47:24] Ardesco: ;)
[16:47:27] dude-x: jQuery.active is an undocumented function that has to do with AJAX calls.
[16:47:58] dude-x: it works in many cases but not all
[16:48:21] lukeis: cgoldberg: i agree… i like the mini-class way dude-x and I put the expected_conditions together as :)
[16:48:31] Ardesco: the last thing jQuery does it set active state to 0 after it finishes processing everything else
[16:48:45] lukeis: but I can't write that as a one-liner ;)
[16:48:47] Ardesco: so if you are manipulating elements with jQeurry (and only with jQuery) it should be fine
[16:49:32] Ardesco: seltest: only call that where you know you are waiting for a jqeury manipulation to complete 
[16:49:55] seltest: ok so i'm adding "WebDriverWait(self.driver, 5).until(lambda d: d.execute_script("return jQuery.active === 0"))" to the beginning my `self.reassert` method
[16:50:06] seltest: though i still don't understand what's going on there, i'll try this

[16:50:31] cgoldberg: lukeis, yup. basically lambas are only good for when you really want a one-liner.. otherwise i define real functions

[19:27:52] AutomatedTester: ahh poo
[19:27:52] AutomatedTester: I have a fix I wanted for 2.29
[19:27:52] AutomatedTester: anyone know why text would be a special case for visibility when the element has a height/width of 0
[19:27:52] AutomatedTester: e.g. <div style='height:0;width:0;'>Omg I should be seen</div>
[19:28:08] jimevans: AutomatedTester: my bad.
[19:28:27] AutomatedTester: oh well the person I promised it to will be sad
[19:28:37] AutomatedTester: but I am sure they will get over it
[19:28:39] jimevans: i can undo the tag, and get your fix in.
[19:28:40] barancev: testZeroSizedDivIsShownIfDescendantHasSize
[19:28:59] AutomatedTester: barancev: it has a special case for text

[19:29:13] AutomatedTester: jimevans: sod it, they can be sad
[19:29:29] barancev: a special case? let me read the driver code

[19:31:00] jimevans: apparently, i'm bringing an entire entourage with me.
[19:31:15] AutomatedTester: the comment and the line below say text is a special case
[19:31:27] lukeis: jimevans: i will be bringing one with me too 
[19:31:43] AutomatedTester: but AFAIR anything with height/width 0 will not be shown
[19:31:53] jimevans: lukeis: yeah, but all mine will be of legal drinking age.
[19:31:57] jimevans: :)
[19:32:08] lukeis: jimevans: if no one else helps you with the java build i will (after lunch)
[19:32:13] jimevans: okay.
[19:32:14] barancev: ah, the question is why do we have this special case for text? no idea, I wondered too :)
[19:32:50] barancev: images in zero-sized box -- yes, they are visible, text is not
[19:33:05] jimevans: okay, i'm going to restart my .net and IE driver release builds. last looks, anyone?
[19:33:33] santiycr: stephend:  I may be able to squeeze it in
[19:33:40] AutomatedTester: barancev: I am only suggesting removing the text part of the conditional
[19:34:07] barancev: jimevans: I don't think this visibility issue should stop 2.29 because this atom is in effect for many releases already
[19:34:33] barancev: and we need to investigate why text was included as a special case
[19:34:45] jimevans: barancev, AutomatedTester: just giving the opportunity to make a last-minute change, if it's required.

[19:50:41] cgoldberg: regex, you can just add chromedrivers location to your path, and the driver will find it
[19:51:15] jimevans: cgoldberg: be careful recommending that. the .NET bindings didn't support path searching until very recently.
[19:51:34] cgoldberg: jimevans, ah.. didn't know that
[19:51:37] regex: cgoldberg: When you say the path?  You mean just put it in the lib file? 
[19:51:41] jimevans: (and regex is using the .NET bindings)
[19:51:49] cgoldberg: regex, your system path
[19:52:05] jimevans: regex: he means in a directory on the system path. you're far better off specifying the directory.

[21:54:26] lukeis: since we aren't using github to technically do the mirroring
[21:54:33] AutomatedTester: thats what I mean
[21:54:35] lukeis: (krosenvold_'s cron)
[21:55:10] AutomatedTester: interesting
[21:55:12] lukeis: github only does the mirroring twice a day
[21:55:18] lukeis: too infrequent for us
[21:55:39] AutomatedTester: my Mozilla pushes, which only goes to our hg repo, get put on my profile
[21:55:53] AutomatedTester: and we mirror across
[21:56:09] lukeis: maybe krosenvold_ needs a magic git option to preserve it
[21:56:25] AutomatedTester: you shouldnt do
[21:56:36] detronizator has joined #selenium
[21:56:44] AutomatedTester: since a simple cron for the w3c stuff copies the committer info across
[21:56:46] lukeis: *shrug*
[21:56:56] AutomatedTester: maybe it works for hg-> git
[21:57:03] AutomatedTester: but not git->git
[21:57:23] AutomatedTester: *shrug*
[21:57:50] lukeis: even though the selenium repo and websites have been in github a week, my 'new profile' doesn't show my activity from those projects

[22:00:41] t0pgun: hey guys, is there a step by step tutorial somewhere that shows me how to install everything needed to get selenium web driver running on a linux box?
[22:01:05] lukeis: java and the browsers are the things you need to install
[22:01:32] lukeis: you don't install selenium, you run it with java
[22:01:46] lukeis: (or python or ruby or dotnet)
[22:02:33] lukeis: if you want to run chrome you also need :chromedriver and if you want opera, there's an operadriver too

[22:56:29] lukeis: we could depend on the github mirror?
[22:56:52] jarib: yeah
[22:57:15] jarib: though it's nice to have something that's more or less instant
[22:57:34] AutomatedTester: jarib: its consistent... eventually
[22:57:34] lukeis: < 2min for the mirror currently
[22:58:15] lukeis: most of the time < 1 min
[22:58:38] jarib: that's not too bad
[22:59:53] AutomatedTester: thats good enough...
