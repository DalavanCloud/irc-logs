[12:19:58] foolx: Happy new Year to you all ;)
[12:22:19] foolx: And of course i came back with a little question :) i have a website (http://www.iceageonline.com/?aid=3703) where i want to enter the birthdate with selenium (java). The Fields for day/month/year got changed again and my script isn't working anymore. I fixed it for username and pw/pw2, mail etc pp. but still stuck at finding the best css selector for the 3 fields ;( -> Hope anyone of you 
[12:22:19] foolx: can help me out again.
[12:32:06] csmrfx: foolx perhaps you can test your css selector with plain old css
[12:32:35] csmrfx: have a css file that adds border: 2px dotted cyan; -style for the target elem
[12:33:40] foolx: hi, i'm using firefox with firebug to test the css, works quite fine, problem is, the elements don't have valid ids. the used ids are somehow generated while creating the webpage
[12:34:30] csmrfx: IDs will always be valid: any ID should always be unique within that document
[12:35:00] csmrfx: if you have multiple id-attributes with the same values, then your page is 'buggy'
[12:35:20] foolx: yes, but that doesn't help if it is like this id="id67EDB218_0_arrow". The id is unique, but never the same when reloading the page
[12:35:39] csmrfx: oh, changing ID's?
[12:36:06] csmrfx: if your targets dont have id's or if they change, you must use the document hierarchy to point to a element
[12:36:20] foolx: not really possible, not my page. It's one of the pages of our company, but i can't change anything or have anyone change it for the test automation
[12:36:53] csmrfx: well, use xpath then
[12:37:23] foolx: the only valid stuff i can see (for the Days for example) seems to be "<span class="ddTitleText">TT</span>" so i am trying to find a CSS Selector which goes onto the span class with TT as text.
[12:38:35] csmrfx: Do you understand how you can use the document structure to select for elems with css or xpath?
[12:42:32] foolx: yes, mostly ;) Problem is, that i mainly use css selectors in my code and have to change the code to use xpath again. Also i can't really use the documents structure because that changes even more often then the elements themself. ;(
[12:43:47] csmrfx: well you can use either CSS or XPath, although latter will give you slightly more refined selections (but more vague )
[12:44:26] csmrfx: Not much to be done if document structure changes, other than having the process communication worked out with whoever works the document
[12:45:00] foolx: there you see one of the main problems i am working with ;)
[12:45:47] foolx: Everybody startes to shout at me as soon as the test automation isn't working anymore. Noone wants to send me any notice when they are about to change something on any of our many websites ... 
[12:46:16] csmrfx: Communication, communication, communication + meets and common spec
[12:47:58] foolx: easy to want, hard to get ;)
[12:48:13] csmrfx: yeah, many organizations have "culture"
[12:48:49] csmrfx: me, I dont give a fuck, I do what I have to to create a spec, and then all whiners can GTFO if they dont conform to commonly agreed upon...
[12:49:58] Phil__ has joined #selenium
[12:50:18] foolx: yeah, i am working on that. Still lot of work to do there ;)
[12:50:48] csmrfx: ...spec doesn't need to be more than 10 lines on how changes communicated, necessary guidelines on document structure or whatever you need to be able to test

[12:54:48] simonstewart: csmrfx: are you pairing with a dev to do this?
[12:55:20] csmrfx: simonstewart: no, I am working through biz peeps, aiming at project managers
[12:55:51] simonstewart: If you're planning on handing this off to devs, then it might be a good idea to rope one in tooâ€¦

[13:48:47] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: GhostDriver is PhantomJSDriver?

[13:50:02] AutomatedTester: isnt in third_party
[13:50:25] AutomatedTester: eeeeuuuwwww IntelliJ 12 is ugly
[13:50:28] Ardesco: is not working because the class doesn't seem to be in Selenium
[13:50:44] Ardesco: but I can't find the class in the ghost driver code base either
[13:51:12] Ardesco: you can change the theme back to default, I actually prefer darcula :)
[13:52:32] Ardesco: anyway in Ghostdriver there were 3 java classes, PhantomJSDriver, PhantomJSDriverSupplier and PhantomJSCommandExecuutor
[13:52:43] Ardesco: they are now gone
[13:52:46] Ardesco: PhantomJSDriverSupplier is in Selenium

[15:26:03] AutomatedTester: that is normally a good way to start ;)
[15:26:22] simonstewart: Osleg: start anywhere
[15:26:32] simonstewart: And we'll ask questions when we need more information
[15:27:16] Osleg: on website there is a "dropdown" box which is actually an "input" type, when clicking it it open soome options, each one of them is anchor type
[15:27:56] simonstewart: So it's not a "SELECT" tag?
[15:28:02] Osleg: nope, it's input
[15:28:22] simonstewart: OK
[15:28:33] Osleg: i can select it, i can click it, i see options dropdown after click but i can't get the values of items
[15:28:44] Osleg: and i can't click it as "select"
[15:29:07] Osleg: now when im asking i guess that i can search them by "a" tag and click same way
[15:29:12] simonstewart: OK.
[15:29:28] simonstewart: When you can't select them, are you getting an exception?
[15:30:03] simonstewart: Or is nothing happening at all?
[15:30:08] Osleg: if i do "Select(self.driver.find_element_by_id(select_key)).select_by_visible_text(value)" im getting an exception
[15:30:16] simonstewart: You will. 
[15:30:24] simonstewart: The Select support class is for SELECT elements
[15:30:29] simonstewart: And you've not got one of those

[15:32:37] Osleg: selector = self.driver.find_element_by_id('ctl00_ContentTop_cboCardList_categoryList_lblCollapse')
[15:32:43] Osleg: now i can do
[15:32:45] simonstewart: OK
[15:32:47] Osleg: selector.click()
[15:32:53] Osleg: which opens the dropdown
[15:33:05] simonstewart: OK
[15:33:16] Osleg: but i can' iterate trough items in the list neither i can click them
[15:33:23] Osleg: how do i....
[15:33:40] simonstewart: OK. You may need to use a Wait until the links are all visible

[17:10:49] Osleg: i don't know the values of the list
[17:11:01] Osleg: so i need to get all of them and chose which one to click
[17:11:24] lukeis: <button>.find_elements('li')

[19:36:15] jost: I've no time to dig into it myself...
[19:36:15] jimevans: jost: not at all. we don't start IE using the command line. 
[19:36:19] simonstewart: I meant for when it's on: the reason is that people forget that they've enabled this feature, and then try and use the machine for More Than One Thing At A Time
[19:36:25] jost: ok :-)
[19:37:45] jimevans: simonstewart: that's a fair criticism. however, there is *no* *effing* *way* to properly do native events in windows without requiring window focus.
[19:37:59] simonstewart: Sure. I'm not against
[19:38:00] simonstewart: it
[19:38:15] simonstewart: I'm just saying we should output a Big Fucking Warning when we use it
[19:38:23] simonstewart: Ideally flicker the lights in the user's office
[19:38:36] simonstewart: And spell out in morse just how fragile their tests now are
[19:38:42] jimevans: good idea. i'll make sure to make that happen. the warning, not the lights flickering.
[19:38:51] simonstewart: :)
[19:39:49] jimevans: i might be sneaky and use BlockInput() during interactions. :)
[19:40:00] simonstewart: Won't that block your own input?
[19:40:17] jimevans: not if you're using SendInput(). it's the exception to the BlockInput API. :)
[19:40:25] lukeis: jimevans: i know we don't start IE from the command line, but we could shell out those commands to clear history/cookies/etc before launching?  (not sure how people would like that though, since it deletes all for the current user)
[19:40:52] simonstewart: jimevans: Hadanza!
[19:41:01] *lukeis goes back to not caring about IE for the time being ;)
[19:41:47] jimevans: lukeis: if one wanted to implement that as part of the -ensureCleanSession flag in the java server, i wouldn't stop one, but it doesn't belong in the IE driver proper, i don't think.
[19:42:41] lukeis: fair enough :)
[19:43:00] jimevans: though that's a pretty nifty hack, i have to say.
[19:44:55] lukeis: from the comments though it's not a silver bullet (doesn't take care of IE6 and no mention of >7)
[19:46:38] jost: I've tested IE > 7, it seems to work
[19:47:13] jost: but I've only tested IE8 and 9 on Win7 32-bit
[19:50:23] lukeis: doesn't seem to work for me on IE9 win7

[19:56:16] kaawee: When setting a browser text field using 'browser.text_field(:name, "q").set(query)' in selenium-webdriver, it takes ages for IEDriverServer x64 on Windows7 with IE10 preview. Is there any way to speed up the "typing" of letters?
[19:57:03] simonstewart: G'night all
[19:58:14] error_code: lukeis: I can try to change the test to use web driver.
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Jan  7 20:00:26 2013]
[20:00:26] error_code: hm, from the looks of it, that might be a little work. any alt solutions?
[20:01:18] jimevans: kaawee: is it possible you're using watir-webdriver, and not selenium-webdriver?
[20:01:35] jimevans: (that looks suspiciously like watir syntax)
[20:03:34] whatevers: jimevans
[20:03:57] whatevers: the java version of webdriver lets you get the address of the remote server via getAddressOfRemoteServer
[20:03:58] jimevans: whatevers: yes?
[20:04:03] whatevers: is there a .net equivelent?
[20:04:45] whatevers: I am trying to retrieve the address of the machine assigned to my test via the grid
[20:05:22] jimevans: whatevers: nothing explicit in .net, but give me a second.
[20:05:46] lukeis: error_code: not sure, i just tried it on rc and it workedâ€¦ maybe pass in "*firefox" instead of "*chrome"? (but both worked for me) and can you make sure of your firefox version (run 'firefox -v')
[20:07:10] error_code: ok

[20:09:17] error_code: Mozilla Firefox 17.0.1 and, same result when I s/*chrome/*firefox
[20:09:26] jimevans: whatevers: nope. no way to get that information in .NET. 
[20:09:47] error_code: lukeis: if it is a firefox issue, can I not tell selenium to not use firefox at all?
[20:09:48] whatevers: : (
[20:09:59] jimevans: all you could possibly get is the address of the hub.
[20:10:10] jimevans: and you already have that.
[20:10:17] whatevers: is it stored in a private var like in the java version?
[20:10:29] whatevers: or are you saying that it is stored, but that variable would simply be a url to the hub
[20:11:49] jimevans: the latter. and if i'm reading the java code correctly, that's all you'll get back from the java bindings too.
[20:12:01] whatevers: : (
[20:12:31] whatevers: just brainstorming here, is there something i could plant on the browsers which i could retrieve with some javascript
[20:12:34] jimevans: that's kind of the whole point of the grid's hub-and-spoke architecture. you don't know the address of the node machine, because your client never actually executes against it.
[20:12:37] whatevers: that would uniquely identify the machine
[20:12:57] jimevans: and furthermore, you probably shouldn't care.
[20:13:20] whatevers: the problem is when a test fails because the machine it was executed on was not setup correctly to run the test
[20:13:28] whatevers: IE, missing host file entries or whatnot
[20:14:00] whatevers: or if one of the machines is ill, and has a tendency to fail for hardware reasons
[20:14:06] whatevers: i have no hints as to which of the machines it is
[20:14:49] jimevans: i understand your problem, but as far as i know, the grid itself doesn't give clients access to the information you're asking for.
[20:15:35] whatevers: what if say...i configured each machine to add a unique identifier to its useragent string...and then get the test to execute some javascript to query it
[20:15:52] whatevers: i mean maybe there is a better way of doing that then having to alter the useragent string
[20:16:20] jimevans: whatevers: try it. i have no idea if that would work. maybe it would.
[20:16:59] error_code: lukeis: finally got it working w/ "DISPLAY=:1 xvfb-run java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar"

[20:18:11] lukeis: error_code: whoa! what jar?
[20:18:43] *lukeis looks at the topicâ€¦ 2.28 is out ;) 
[20:20:11] error_code: lukeis: heh, that was copy and pasted from stack overflow. my filename is using current
[20:20:13] error_code: :)
[20:20:53] lukeis: and ah, yeah, if you're running headless linux then xvfb (or xvnc) are required :)
[20:21:20] error_code: thanks a ton for the ideas and direction.
[20:28:50] lukeis: whatevers: you could write a custom servlet and attach it to the grid to return back the node being used for a particular sessionIdâ€¦ bit involved, but possible (I think)
[20:30:37] whatevers: how would i go about doing such a thing
[20:31:12] lukeis: https://github.com/freynaud/grid-plugin-tutorial  i think is a start
[20:31:27] lukeis: https://github.com/freynaud/grid-plugin-tutorial/wiki/Tutorial
[20:31:52] whatevers: im not entirely fluent in java : /
[20:32:38] lukeis: then feel free to ignore the suggestion :)
[20:33:37] AutomatedTester: whatevers: https://github.com/AutomatedTester/speedy-gonzales-proxy is a quick example of a grid addon that gets the node info
[20:34:26] AutomatedTester: whatevers: in particular https://github.com/AutomatedTester/speedy-gonzales-proxy/blob/master/src/com/mozilla/seleniumgrid/SpeedyGonzalesProxy.java#L28
[20:35:40] AutomatedTester: anyone know where Adam is today?
[20:36:45] whatevers: what does that moveMouse url produce?
[20:37:21] AutomatedTester: whatevers: that addon sends a message to the node which has a little server running to move the mouse off the browser if someone left it there
[20:37:59] AutomatedTester: but in this case it was doing IP addresses
[20:38:27] AutomatedTester: bbl
[20:38:28] whatevers: i see, so i wouldn't need to run the little remote server on the node, but use this to intercept when a new session is created on the hub?

[20:39:22] AeroNotix: when I driver.get(..) a page?
[20:39:34] AutomatedTester: AeroNotix: in the browser?
[20:39:42] AeroNotix: AutomatedTester: can't I access it?
[20:39:48] AeroNotix: is what I am asking
[20:39:56] AeroNotix: from selenium

[21:52:39] kaawee: jimevans: well, I'm using watir-webdriver, which builds upon selenium-webdriver AFAIK and it looks like the changes in watir-webdriver are unlikely to be the culprit of the behaviour observed
[21:54:04] lukeis: kaawee: which is easily provable by using straight selenium-webdriver with ruby (/me recommends proving it, but I do not doubt your claim)
[21:55:08] lukeis: simon once told me there is a 'sleep' in send keys to deal with some issue with IE and the shift key (or something like that)
[21:55:35] jimevans: i'm elbows deep in that code right now, even.
[21:56:47] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[21:56:55] AeroNotix: really enjoying writing front-end tests using selenium
[21:56:56] jimevans: but since i do not have an IE10 installation, i can neither confirm nor deny.
[21:56:59] kaawee: yes, it looks like a Sleep(5000)
[21:57:07] kaawee: from the timing I can measure
[21:57:11] cgoldberg: AeroNotix, a get() doesn't have a response code..  a webdriver get() initiates an HTTP GET, Which may load many other assets over HTTP.  it doesn't map 1->1 with a single HTTP request->response
[21:57:18] lukeis: hehâ€¦ i highly doubt that kaawee
[21:57:30] kaawee: one character per 5 seconds..
[21:57:33] jimevans: kaawee: i can tell you for certain there's not a Sleep(5000) in the code base.
[21:58:49] lukeis: each character does however need to trigger multiple dom events: onkeydown, onkeyup, onkeypress, onchange (I think there's more)  and related if the shift or other modifier key is enabled 
[21:58:55] AeroNotix: cgoldberg: yeah I get what's happening - just was asking if it stores "A" response code anywhere. It doesn't. imokwiththat.jpg
[21:59:37] kaawee: well, what's worse is it seems that the HTTP communication between ruby and the browser has a standard timeout of 60 seconds
[21:59:46] kaawee: which means I have 12 characters max to input...
[21:59:50] cgoldberg: AeroNotix, browsermob proxy was mentioned.. have you tried that?  it's pretty cool
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Jan  7 22:00:27 2013]
[22:00:27] AeroNotix: cgoldberg: nope. I'll try it at work tomorrow. It's not super important, anyway. I have other methods of getting what I need but I'll certainly remember browsermob for the future.
[22:01:00] lukeis: kaawee: beyond jimevans coming up with a magical solution, selenium provides an execute_script api that you can set the text on an input (bypassing sendkeys and all the related events): execute_script("arguments[0].value = arguements[1]", webElement, "string to send")
[22:01:24] jimevans: or, of course, turn off native events in the IE driver. :_)
[22:01:25] lukeis: i do not know watir-webdriver well enough on how you would do that :)
