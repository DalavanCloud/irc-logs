[00:01:47] dude-x: i thought bromine was selenium for brogrammers
[00:06:11] lukeis has joined #selenium
[00:12:35] chrchr: How do I turn off all this debug output in python webdriver?
[00:12:55] lukeis: what debug output?
[00:14:51] dude-x: debug output?
[00:15:32] dude-x: chrchr: can you be specify what you're seeing?
[00:15:32] lukeis: if logging.Logger.setLevel is called in your code, then it will log requests
[00:16:14] chrchr: Yeah I guess it is logging requests. I haven't called that but maybe the python driver has.
[00:16:21] chrchr: Stuff like this (sorry for spam): selenium.webdriver.remote.remote_connection: DEBUG: POST http://127.0.0.1:53001/hub/session/c6e2100b-db44-c74c-b64b-8c81352beee7/element/{5cfcfa48-083d-0946-8e9f-cfe057606798}/click {"sessionId": "c6e2100b-db44-c74c-b64b-8c81352beee7", "id": "{5cfcfa48-083d-0946-8e9f-cfe057606798}"}
[00:16:26] chrchr: selenium.webdriver.remote.remote_connection: DEBUG: GET http://127.0.0.1:53001/hub/session/c6e2100b-db44-c74c-b64b-8c81352beee7/title {"sessionId": "c6e2100b-db44-c74c-b64b-8c81352beee7"}

[00:16:37] lukeis: yeah, that means that the debug level has been set in your code
[00:16:49] lukeis: (or some other code you are importing)
[00:16:53] dude-x: chrchr: is this selenium python 2.29?
[00:17:11] dude-x: are you using remote webdriver with the java server?
[00:17:17] chrchr: dude-x: Uh it is whatever i got when I did 'pip install selenium' on Wednesday.
[00:17:30] chrchr: dude-x: No I'm using the Firefox webdriver.
[00:17:32] lukeis: dude-x: should be with the last few versions and more than just remote
[00:18:32] dude-x: i use 2.28 and i don't see those log messages
[00:20:31] dude-x: chrchr: i'd look at your code and see if there is logging used somewhere. that's the only plausible thing
[00:21:00] lukeis: or you could disable itâ€¦ import logging; logging.disable(logging.DEBUG)

[16:57:01] zeljkof: anybody knows if selenium project uses wiki.openqa.org at all?
[16:57:23] zeljkof: I am trying to clean up spam there, so it would help if I knew if it is used or not
[16:58:03] andreastt: I think Selenium 1 did.
[16:58:15] andreastt: But it hasn't been maintained in years.
[IRC logfile - Started Sat Jan 19 17:24:54 2013]
[17:24:54] zeljkof: thanks andreastt
[17:25:12] zeljkof: looks like all wikis at openqa are flooded with spam
[17:25:27] zeljkof: except watir one, since I was cleaning up spam there manually

[17:33:08] andreastt: Selenium currently uses the Google Code wiki.
[17:36:05] zeljkof: andreastt: looks like nobody is using openqa wiki any more
[17:36:08] zeljkof: and it is full of spam
[17:36:25] zeljkof: probably the best thing would be to delete the wiki completely
[17:36:35] zeljkof: now it is full of spam links
