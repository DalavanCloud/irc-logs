[01:08:56] jleyba: :note jimevans Synthetic events for the IEDriver are not persisting modifier keys for the interactions API (e.g. sendKeysToActiveElement).  Nothing for you to do right now, just an FYI.  I'm working on this for Safari so you can piggy back on that.

[14:42:58] Guruuu: will using pnp entitle me to use all features of selenium/web driver?
[14:43:01] Guruuu: php*
[14:44:15] Guruuu: or maybe python?
[14:44:26] Guruuu: or I must use java for all features?
[14:50:45] Guruuu: why the fuck there are 85 users ? 
[14:59:54] andreastt: Guruuu: WebDriver is a protocol, so provided the PHP bindings you go for have implemented all the API calls, you'll get all of WebDriver's features.
[IRC logfile - Started Sat Jan 26 15:00:24 2013]
[15:00:24] andreastt: In any case, there aren't any language specific limitations in terms of features.
