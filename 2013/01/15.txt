[00:03:57] link15: hey all i'm trying to use the python binding with selenium.webdriver.remote.WebDriver
[00:04:05] link15: and i'm not sure what capabilities to request
[00:04:12] link15: i have the server set up to do full firefox testing
[00:04:34] lukeis: if you do this import:   from selenium import webdriver
[00:04:43] lukeis: use webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX
[00:04:58] lukeis: it's just a python dictionary
[00:06:43] link15:  desired_capabilities=webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX
[00:07:04] lukeis: that should work
[00:07:32] lukeis: and remote is 'shortcutted' as just webdriver.Remote  too
[00:09:10] link15: cls.driver = WebDriver(command_executor='http://path_to_remote:4444/wd/hub', desired_capabilities=webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX)
[00:09:23] link15: that gives me an error saying desired_capabilities can't be none
[00:09:33] link15: my server is just doing java -jar ./selenium-standalone*
[00:09:54] link15: do i need to somehow indicate to the server that FIREFOX is available to it
[00:09:55] link15: ?
[00:11:17] link15: hmm
[00:11:19] link15: now i get
[00:11:33] link15: ebDriverException: Message: 'Message: u\'Unable to connect to host 127.0.0.1 on port 7055 after 45000 ms. Firefox console output:\\nError: no display specified\\nError: no display specified\\n\' ; Stacktrace: Method start threw an error in NewProfileExtensionConnection.java
[00:11:58] lukeis: need to start xvfb and set a display? :)
[00:12:30] link15:  /etc/environment has DISPLAY=:5.0
[00:12:59] DaveIngram has joined #selenium
[00:13:05] lukeis: echo $DISPLAY  <- in the same terminal that you run the jar command
[00:13:36] lukeis: but maybe the environment should take care of it? /me doesn't do this much :)
[00:14:04] davehunt has joined #selenium
[00:14:07] lukeis: most of the time i see export DISPLAY=:5.0; java -jar ....
[00:14:27] lukeis: or whatever number your display is on

[00:34:49] link15: it doesnt understand my display params
[00:39:16] santiycr has joined #selenium
[00:43:07] link15: so why would my selenium server not work
[00:43:28] santiycr: solar spots 
[00:46:44] link15: seriously, how do i debug this
[00:46:47] link15: i have a server runing it
[00:46:50] link15: with xvfb
[00:46:58] santiycr: what do you mean by it doesn't work?
[00:46:59] link15: running on DISPLAY=:5.0
[00:47:12] link15: i mean when i try to connect to it via the python api i recieve this message

[00:47:53] santiycr: nice
[00:48:12] link15: i would happly supply more source code if needed
[00:48:35] link15: i'm running the server with DISPLAY=:5.0 and firefox installed and xvfb running on diplay :5.0
[00:48:40] santiycr: seems like FirefoxDriver isn't listening once firefox starts
[00:48:47] santiycr: which firefox version do you have installed?
[00:49:02] santiycr: can you confirm that firefox got launched?
[00:49:15] link15: how would i confirm, doesnt selenium launch it
[00:49:20] santiycr: what's the full log from selenium-server.jar?
[00:50:24] link15: one sec fetching
[00:53:21] link15: whoa
[00:53:24] link15: seems like its working now

[08:19:49] lukeis: krosenvold_: so, that was me who added people to a 'team' in the seleniumhq org in github (so that everyone can clone pull requests, of course that now gives them the ability to accidentally push to github…)
[08:20:09] lukeis: s/clone/close/
[08:22:10] krosenvold_: I have not checked if the selenium repo is actually read only
[08:22:20] krosenvold_: add me to the team and I'll find out ;)
[08:22:25] lukeis: you are
[08:23:49] lukeis: i wonder if github is doing maintenance? i just got logged out (that's never happened to me before…)
[08:26:21] krosenvold_: lukeis: Ok, it's not read only. Might hold off on the mass-adding to seleniumhq until it is
[08:26:59] lukeis: will it ever be?
[08:27:07] lukeis: does github do that?
[08:27:08] krosenvold_: Too late for holding off
[08:27:16] krosenvold_: I will ask github if they can ;)
[08:27:27] lukeis: yeah, i added a few 'main' contributors already
[08:27:28] krosenvold_: They do a lot of stuff if you ask
[08:27:59] lukeis: well, basically everyone i could quickly think of their GH handle ;0
[08:34:09] p0deje has joined #selenium
[08:35:22] krosenvold_: I sent off a request to github to make it r/o
[08:37:27] lukeis: krosenvold_: should you be an owner of seleniumhq  org in github to give it more authority of a request :) or do they just know ;)
[08:37:41] p0deje has joined #selenium
[08:38:46] krosenvold_: lukeis: Can you add me as a owner ?
[08:39:06] lukeis: added...
[08:39:17] lukeis: i may be abusing my powers a bit much 
[08:39:26] krosenvold_: You can always remove me later; I am long past wanting excessive priviliges in the oss worls ;)
[08:39:40] *lukeis expects git access revoking by simon any minute ;)
[08:39:49] krosenvold_: Nah, don't worry
[08:39:55] krosenvold_: Simon can be bought with beer
[08:42:55] lukeis: honestly if we get 'teams' set up well on github, then I don't want to be an 'owner' there :)
[08:43:46] lukeis: any idea why the mirroring is taking so long?

[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jan 15 09:01:39 2013]
[09:01:39] simonstewart: :note lukeis I'll ask them nicely. Those are mirrors though, so read-only
[09:01:41] selbot2_: ok!
[09:10:23] simonstewart: krosenvold_: I can restrict futz around in the "Teams" setting to reduce access to the github repo

[09:13:16] krosenvold_: simonstewart: Lukeis granted me infinite powers while you were sleeping
[09:13:25] krosenvold_: So I suppose I can do it too ;)
[09:13:29] simonstewart: Heh.
[09:13:31] simonstewart: Might be an idea.
[09:13:36] krosenvold_: I just converted github to maven
[09:13:44] krosenvold_: muahhahhahahah
[09:13:57] simonstewart: wtf?
[09:14:00] simonstewart: WHHHYYYY?
[09:15:20] krosenvold_: Just kidding
[09:15:35] *simonstewart wipes brow
[09:15:39] simonstewart: *phew*
[09:15:39] simonstewart: :)
[09:15:49] krosenvold_: I tweaked the committers repo to read only
[09:15:56] krosenvold_: committers group
[09:16:08] krosenvold_: MIght not be entirely the right thing to do
[09:16:27] simonstewart: We'll see what happens
[09:16:43] simonstewart: How did you do that?
[09:16:44] krosenvold_: But it should restrict pushes to "owners
[09:17:07] krosenvold_: Futzing with settings below https://github.com/organizations/SeleniumHQ/teams
[09:17:55] simonstewart: ta
[09:19:18] simonstewart: Do we need to update the wiki on how to handle checking code in? And handling pull requests?
[09:23:41] simonstewart: krosenvold_: good job on the mailing lists. Looks like Ivan's having a hard time getting to grips with things
[09:23:52] simonstewart: Thanks for helping set him straight
[09:24:21] simonstewart: As I type that, this appears on twitter: https://twitter.com/chrisdavidmills/status/291114511568625664
[09:24:34] *simonstewart becomes more insufferably smug
[09:25:08] krosenvold_: If you're using one of those fruity computers you should probably try github  for mac too ;)
[09:25:14] simonstewart: Now, what does this "network graph" tell me?
[09:25:21] simonstewart: krosenvold_: I'd rather master the command line
[09:25:28] simonstewart: I use Macs and Linux boxes
[09:25:37] simonstewart: I'd hate to be powerless
[09:25:37] krosenvold_: simonstewart: The network graph is the good shit
[09:25:54] krosenvold_: Read the blog post at the top of the graph
[09:26:21] simonstewart: Gosh. github is slow

[09:28:25] simonstewart: Seems like magic to me
[09:28:32] *simonstewart dons curmudgeon hat
[09:29:01] simonstewart: So according to that graph, krosenvold_ is two commits ahead of master
[09:29:12] krosenvold_: Always aheda ;)
[09:29:13] krosenvold_: ahead
[09:29:20] simonstewart: :P
[09:29:32] simonstewart: Is there a pull request for those changes anywhere?
[09:29:42] simonstewart: Or are you going to push them yourself?
[09:29:44] krosenvold_: Of course, the mirroring not working properly has me only 1 commit ahead of google code
[09:30:07] krosenvold_: The *really* imprtant thing about the network graph is that it shows you stuff the community is hacking on
[09:30:08] simonstewart: Ah. Yes
[09:30:12] simonstewart: Just did a pull and saw that
[09:30:31] simonstewart: There's not much happening. I expected about 70 forks and lots of contributions by now
[09:30:47] krosenvold_: So at any point you really have no way of knowing if a commit on the network graph is ready for submission or just a totally crazy hack someone tried
[09:31:06] krosenvold_: The pull request is the semantics of saying "i'm done"
[09:31:07] simonstewart: I assume the latter
[09:31:13] simonstewart: k
[09:31:33] simonstewart: (BTW, you appear to have checked in using your apache.org address. I'm fine with that, but thought you'd like to know)
[09:31:34] krosenvold_: Yes you should; we cannot really pull wild changes just because we find them on github. We need author's consent
[09:31:49] simonstewart: And the author must have signed the CLA
[09:32:04] simonstewart: I'll be removing any revision where that's not the case
[09:32:58] krosenvold_: But I think some of the real niceness lies here: Every now and then I browse the network graph for projects I care about. Sometimes I snoop on changes I see people have done, and sometimes I leave a comment encouraging them to keep on the good work and submit a patch
[09:33:10] simonstewart: Nice.
[09:33:24] krosenvold_: s/patch/pull request/ ;)
[09:33:38] simonstewart: Ha!
[09:33:45] simonstewart: Wait until we move to hg…. 
[09:34:53] krosenvold_: So any moment now I'll be moving all my half-assed changes to my personal github clone, and the network graph will explode with all sorts of weird stuff I've been keeping to myself
[09:35:20] simonstewart: You forgot to include your evil cackle
[09:35:30] krosenvold_: Some of it is actually good stuff
[09:35:50] simonstewart: Such as?
[09:36:02] krosenvold_: But since I switch computers a lot I *always* push to github, som sometimes I push mid-sentence
[09:37:13] krosenvold_: By the look of the branch list in the old https://github.com/krosenvold/selenium2 I have some jetty7 migration tests
[09:37:28] krosenvold_: And a few test cases
[09:38:28] simonstewart: handy
[09:43:26] krosenvold_: Its work I started on migrating EVERYTHING to jettt7/8
[09:43:44] krosenvold_: Of course there is the dark magic ssl stuff which impeeded the whole effort
[09:43:51] krosenvold_: <insert big todo>
[09:43:53] simonstewart: It'd be nice to get everything on one version of an http server
[09:44:14] simonstewart: Yeah. That SSL stuff blocked plightbo a long time ago, and is why we never updated jetty
[09:44:16] krosenvold_: And I spent a few hours trying to get us there
[09:44:32] krosenvold_: I have the feeling it should be doable
[09:44:53] krosenvold_: Just requires a big crash helmet and the ability to break everything. I wonder who can do that ;)
[09:44:57] simonstewart: We're using a Turing complete language. It's doable
[09:45:06] simonstewart: :whobrokethebuild
[09:45:59] simonstewart: I really need to sort out the exceptions in this project
[09:46:08] simonstewart: "No alert present" should be "no such alert"
[09:46:15] simonstewart: in keeping with the other "No such..."
[09:46:24] zeljkof has joined #selenium
[09:46:54] simonstewart: And there's a lot of xpath specific errors that could be crunched down to invalid selectors.
[09:46:58] krosenvold_: Fact 1: Selenium switched to git

[10:59:46] simonstewart: (also we appear to have broken github)
[10:59:46] krosenvold_: Ardesco: "fork" on github, clone from google code

[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jan 15 11:00:06 2013]

[11:00:37] Ardesco: now i'm cloning my fork locally
[11:00:37] simonstewart: bmp then
[11:00:48] simonstewart: nmp then 
[11:00:53] simonstewart: (damn autocorrect on lion)
[11:01:04] Ardesco: it's cloning my fork that stalling
[11:01:04] krosenvold_: Ardesco: You need a bunch of commits that you're missing.- You can get those from google code or girhub
[11:01:06] krosenvold_: github
[11:01:39] Ardesco: as soon as I have cloned my fork i'll pull changes from upstream
[11:01:40] krosenvold_: simonstewart: I got a response from github support; they say the synch on the mirror is something like twice a day. If we want more frequent we need to install hook in google code repo
[11:01:57] simonstewart: Do they have a hook we can point to?
[11:02:03] simonstewart: Because I can add one really easily
[11:02:10] krosenvold_: The hook should be in google code
[11:02:16] krosenvold_: A push hook. I think I found that
[11:02:25] krosenvold_: Then the push hook can push to github
[11:02:28] simonstewart: A post-commit hook
[11:02:34] simonstewart: That's what it's called
[11:02:48] simonstewart: It's a URL that a POST containing information about the change will be sent to
[11:02:58] simonstewart: Presumably it'll live somewhere on github
[11:03:07] krosenvold_: Note dawagner I wouldn't be surprised if the google code guys have such a hook alread and can just pop it in for us
[11:03:22] simonstewart: They don't
[11:03:29] simonstewart: http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/PostCommitWebHooks
[11:03:41] krosenvold_: I read that; i'm still saying ;)
[11:04:19] simonstewart: I can tell you that they don't have that hook
[11:04:22] krosenvold_: The hook basically needs to trigger a 2 line shell script that does:
[11:04:25] krosenvold_: git fetch googlecode
[11:04:32] krosenvold_: git push --tags github
[11:04:42] simonstewart: It'd need the ssh key of someone who can commit to the mirror
[11:04:48] krosenvold_: Yup
[11:05:09] simonstewart: Which is why if it was hosted on github it'd be easy to make this work
[11:05:29] krosenvold_: So it's basically just a git clone --bare <googlecode>
[11:05:33] krosenvold_: Where does selbot run ?
[11:05:39] simonstewart: I have no idea
[11:05:48] krosenvold_: "The cloud"
[11:06:21] krosenvold_: Obviously thegithub guys think the source should push in a mirroring setup. I would do that too ;)
[11:06:54] simonstewart: I almost wrote an app engine script to do that
[11:07:16] krosenvold_: While we're thinking I'll whack together the 3 line shell script on the account I use to maintain the existing "Selenium2" repo
[11:07:34] krosenvold_: No
[11:07:40] krosenvold_: I forgot; public ip needed
[11:08:06] simonstewart: Fuck you, lion. It's appengine .
[11:08:17] zeljkof has joined #selenium
[11:08:28] simonstewart: Right. Appengine. You see?
[11:13:01] AutomatedTester: selbot2_: runs on jarib's VPS iirc
[11:14:04] krosenvold_: I sent mail to devlist. Someone probably has somewhere to put it ;)
[11:15:15] krosenvold_: simonstewart: I assume you have the bit on google code that allows us to insert the hook ?
[11:15:24] simonstewart: Yes I do
[11:15:35] krosenvold_: Does it support multiple hooks ?
[11:15:41] simonstewart: Yes it does
[11:15:59] simonstewart: Oh. It may do

[11:19:31] krosenvold_: Why do I have to be OP to set topic ?

[11:22:14] krosenvold_: Not mandatory, but ok
[11:22:36] krosenvold_: But usually a submission is just 1 commit, so there's not much "internal" history
[11:22:43] krosenvold_: I know the purists disagree

[11:31:05] Dave_B: When testing a site in firefox (remotewebdriver) I encountered an unexpected 'authorisation required' dialog

[11:31:16] papegaaij has joined #selenium
[11:31:23] Dave_B: this caused my tests to fail 9expected) but then teardown failed
[11:31:30] *krosenvold_ knows that with much power comes much responsibility
[11:31:52] Dave_B: the grid node remained tied up even once the timeout had expired
[11:32:28] Dave_B: anyone know how to deal with this? I can check for the auth in teardown I guess, but what if something else goes wrong? Should the nodes cleanup not be able to handle this? :/
[11:33:44] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[11:33:46] simonstewart: The site being visited is requesting auth? Or the grid node?
[11:33:54] Dave_B: the site
[11:34:23] Dave_B: but when the auth dialog is open you can't close the browser - I'm assumnig this is why the node doesn't clean up after the timeout times out

[11:41:02] Ardesco: I don't see an obvious .git path to use browsing the repo either
[11:42:08] simonstewart: You may need to modify your .netrc

[12:23:23] Ardesco: I could but it'll take some time to start the download again :)
[12:23:57] simonstewart: Start it: you want to determine whether there's some weird config problem or whether you're just not reaching google code
[12:24:05] simonstewart: Also, which git version are you on>
[12:24:24] Ardesco: initial clone from googlecode seems to be working

[12:25:03] simonstewart: ok
[12:25:06] simonstewart: that should be fine
[12:26:06] simonstewart: According to the git FAQ on google code this should work:

[12:41:05] simonstewart: My eyes just crossed: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#windows
[12:42:48] andreastt: So a browsing context is a frame, essentially.  I wonder if it defines viewport.
[12:43:20] AutomatedTester: we shouldnt be defining viewport since there are other specs that define it well
[12:44:29] simonstewart: I think that's what andreastt was asking
[12:44:42] andreastt: It says in the note:
[12:44:48] andreastt: “A tab or window in a Web browser typically contains a browsing context, as does an iframe or frames in a frameset.”
[12:45:02] andreastt: The “as does” bit is confusing.
[12:45:25] andreastt: Especially to implementors.  As what they're _really_ saying is that it's really not the same.
[12:45:59] simonstewart: Wait until you get to the bit where a single window or frame can have more than one browsing context
[12:46:54] *simonstewart starts going through the spec ripping out NamesLikeThisForErrorCodes and replacing with "names like this"

[12:58:23] simonstewart: svn cp was hard?

[14:31:47] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I had those already, you have a few more which look useful
[14:32:03] p_l: heh. Thanks to just copying a bunch of stuff from one $HOME to another, I forgot what was in my gitconfig, enough that I had to look...
[14:32:06] nirvdrum: Some use legit (installable with pip)
[14:32:40] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Your diff looks like: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/536435/line_endings.png
[14:33:05] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: hmm
[14:33:45] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: aha I see them now

[14:33:52] AutomatedTester: now that I have colours 
[14:35:29] nirvdrum: p_l: It looks like he inserted CRLF and he's on Mac.
[14:35:56] p_l: nirvdrum: just fool any sensible editor into thinking it has to use CRLF :)
[14:36:02] nirvdrum: Heh.
[14:36:32] p_l: most sensible editors try intelligently switch line endings
[14:36:48] nirvdrum: You can override it in your git defaults too.
[14:37:29] nirvdrum: Although it looks like that file uses CRLF throughout, so maybe it's just my terminal.
[14:37:40] nirvdrum: Assuming my hex editor isn't lying to me.
[14:38:01] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: how do I fix it
[14:38:23] *AutomatedTester tries emacs
[14:38:51] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I may just be an asshole.  It looks like your line endings match the rest of the file.
[14:39:11] AutomatedTester: may?
[14:39:12] AutomatedTester: :P
[14:39:22] nirvdrum: Well, with regards to this one particular item.
[14:39:23] *AutomatedTester ruffles nirvdrum's hair
[14:39:30] *simonstewart gets popcorn
[14:39:32] nirvdrum: I don't mind it.
[14:40:05] simonstewart: Right. So, we're moving from ints to strings for status codes on responses
[14:40:07] qaguy has joined #selenium
[14:40:09] melter has joined #selenium
[14:40:33] simonstewart: Debating what to do with Response.status
[14:41:04] simonstewart: It's tempting to leave it alone, so we can interop with older clients/servers while making The Great Int To String Switcheroo
[14:41:05] RossPatterson: Would now be the time to observe that SVN converts text files between LF in the repo and LF, CR, or CRLF on the client depending on the client side?  Just sayin' :-)
[14:41:11] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Does this have to do with JS and thus JSON not really having an int type?
[14:41:14] simonstewart: Yes, RossPatterson now is the time
[14:41:29] simonstewart: It's from feedback on the specs. 
[14:41:40] simonstewart: Turns out that no-one understands what integers mean
[14:41:49] knorrium has joined #selenium
[14:41:57] nirvdrum: Heh.  Interesting.
[14:41:58] simonstewart: And we'd probably need to rejig ours in any case because it's full of holes
[14:41:59] RossPatterson: "[\d]+"
[14:42:10] simonstewart: Thank you, RossPatterson 
[14:42:18] AutomatedTester: it also aligns us more with the approach that HTML5 is taking
[14:42:47] AutomatedTester: iirc
[14:42:50] simonstewart: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html#error-codes
[14:42:57] simonstewart: That's what we're heading to
[14:43:12] simonstewart: I'm also going to be taking an axe to our exception hierarchy
[14:43:19] simonstewart: There's way too many xpath specific things in there
[14:43:45] simonstewart: which should be generalized to Invalid Selectors
[14:44:21] dude-x has joined #selenium
[14:44:21] RossPatterson: I like the new Error Codes section.  Since they're strings, presumably they're exact values?  No leading/trailing whitespace, and case-sensitive?
[14:44:32] simonstewart: Exact values
[14:44:36] simonstewart: All lower case
[14:44:41] *RossPatterson smiles
[14:44:44] simonstewart: All case sensitive
[14:47:04] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: you are teaching us well ;)
[14:47:10] RossPatterson: LOL
[14:47:48] RossPatterson: Also nice to see the JSON/HTTP serialization is now normative.
[14:48:33] simonstewart: What's the alternative name for "status" on the Response object.
[14:48:35] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Should I hold off on the changes I was looking to make to the exception classes then?
[14:48:40] simonstewart: Best I can come up with right now is "code"
[14:48:51] simonstewart: I don't know what changes you were thinking of :)
[14:49:05] simonstewart: Response.code contains the string that is the response code
[14:49:07] RossPatterson: Result?
[14:49:22] simonstewart: Could be confused with the value
[14:49:38] RossPatterson: Denouement?
[14:49:41] RossPatterson: )
[14:49:43] RossPatterson: :-)
[14:49:47] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Mostly reworking cases of UnknownError where we know exactly what they are into either their correct exception types or introducing new ones.
[14:49:57] simonstewart: Go for it
[14:50:32] RossPatterson: Perhaps just errorCode?  Since the codes are called Error Codes?
[14:50:55] simonstewart: Possibly. Though I don't like the idea of "success" being an _error_ code
[14:50:56] *RossPatterson always liked C's perror() output: "No error" :-)
[14:51:00] RossPatterson: ^^^
[14:51:09] nirvdrum: In ruby, response.code is the status code.
[14:51:21] simonstewart: ffs
[14:51:26] simonstewart: This is going to get messy
[14:53:44] simonstewart: Response.state
[14:53:58] simonstewart: That works, right?
[14:54:09] RossPatterson: SGTM
[14:54:15] simonstewart: Then that's what we're using
[14:54:23] simonstewart: I love it when a plan comes togetgher
[14:54:28] simonstewart: Also, spelling
[14:55:37] RossPatterson: OK to start another spec topic?

[15:00:05] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[15:00:13] RossPatterson: 2.2 Response says: "The default value for the sessionId must be the sessionId used in the Command that this is a response to, unless the Command's sessionId was the null value, in which case a unique sessionId must be assigned (see newSession for how this is achieved)."
[15:01:25] RossPatterson: I'm having a hard time figuring out any other command than "newSession" that should be allowed to change the sessionId.  Because the sessionId binds the Command and Response to each other, right?
[15:01:43] sahazel has joined #selenium
[15:11:03] simonstewart: RossPatterson: there might be commands that control the remote end
[15:11:08] simonstewart: "quitquitquit" would be one
[15:11:41] simonstewart: Adding a new browser config or node to a grid would be other examples
[15:12:24] RossPatterson: Got it - Response.sessionId == null is only allowed for commands not related to a session.  Correct?
[15:12:34] simonstewart: Yes
[15:12:42] RossPatterson: 'scoo bro'
[15:12:46] simonstewart: But the commands are sequenced by sessionId
[15:12:59] simonstewart: So when a new conversation is started, a sessionid must exist
[15:13:26] simonstewart: Which implies that the remote end must assign a sessionid if one is not already specified
[15:13:40] simonstewart: Perhaps I should read the spec before pushing it....

[15:34:56] SamG: What is the opinion on input agnosticism and finer grained 'pointer' inputs with webdriver I noticed in the spec that it should fall back to mouse events if touch and mouse is available,  is there any inclination to make this more configurable?
[15:36:30] simonstewart: Right now? No
[15:36:42] simonstewart: One of the things we need to wrestle with is Pointer Events
[15:36:43] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: hey when did your boxes update to Firefox 18?
[15:37:03] regex has joined #selenium
[15:37:09] simonstewart: I suspect that, mouse and and touch events all need to get in a box with a knife and duke it out
[15:37:18] regex: :seen jimevans
[15:37:19] selbot2_: jimevans was last seen 3 days ago, leaving.
[15:37:35] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: well the thing is that a lot of the time touch and mouse need to work together
[15:37:38] simonstewart: SamG: do you have any particular needs?
[15:37:41] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: e.g. tap()
[15:37:41] cgoldberg: hey.. i can check.  but it my CI slaves get nightly package updates from the main Ubuntu repos for Precise LTS version )12.04)
[15:38:07] SamG: simonstewart I agree but I also agree with AutomatedTester
[15:38:12] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, ^^
[15:38:24] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: it needs to do touchstart touchend mousemove <something else> click
[15:38:40] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: well, WebElement.click should redirect to "whatever is most appropriate for the device" between click and tap
[15:38:55] simonstewart: And then those are ambiguous
[15:39:09] simonstewart: We don't implement that with a redirect in http
[15:39:19] simonstewart: But we should really be constructing things that way on the server side
[15:39:26] simonstewart: (the equivalent Actions)
[15:40:05] simonstewart: I'm rather enjoying this right now: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEOct6CEidc
[15:40:29] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: this is one of the issues Mozilla is wrestling with at the moment
[15:40:36] simonstewart: k
[15:40:50] simonstewart: So, is the problem with WebElement.click() or with the TouchActions?
[15:40:54] simonstewart: Or Actions?
[15:41:34] AutomatedTester: semantics really
[15:41:56] simonstewart: Of which method?
[15:42:00] AutomatedTester: click()
[15:42:11] jimevans has joined #selenium
[15:42:11] AutomatedTester: they dont agree with the method when on a mobile device
[15:42:12] selbot2_: jimevans: note from santiycr about 14 hours ago: hey Jim, would you mind giving a look at this? My guess is we need to build support for InternetExplorerOptions inside DesiredCapabilities http://support.saucelabs.com/entries/22935036-internetexploreroptions-with-saucelabs 
[15:42:15] simonstewart: WebElement.click() or Actions.click()
[15:42:17] AutomatedTester: it should be .tap()
[15:42:31] AutomatedTester: and then tap needs to fire different events
[15:42:43] simonstewart: WebElement.click() or Actions.click()?
[15:42:48] AutomatedTester: webelement
[15:42:51] simonstewart: OK
[15:42:55] simonstewart: Then see my answer above :)
[15:43:18] simonstewart: WebElement methods are "do what I mean"
[15:43:31] simonstewart: So WebElement.click() on a desktop browser is handled via a mouse
[15:43:40] simonstewart: On a mobile device, it maps down to a tap
[15:43:51] SamG: The problem we have is that on mobile devices touch actions behave differently in terms of 300ms delay than mouse actions, and we see reports with people having issues with touch devices with mouse support. It would be nice to find and be able to test these cases.
[15:44:00] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: and on Windows 8?
[15:44:08] AutomatedTester: where I can use both...
[15:44:16] simonstewart: If you want to be unambiguous, use Actions or TouchActions
[15:44:22] AutomatedTester: since the events can be different
[15:44:37] simonstewart: On Win8, I'd expect a tablet to map to touch, and a laptop to be mouse
[15:44:49] simonstewart: Or, put another way, Metro to be touch
[15:44:57] simonstewart: "Classic desktop" to be mouse
[15:45:09] SamG: But metro can accept mouse input right?
[15:45:16] simonstewart: SamG: Right. 
[15:45:27] simonstewart: So if you want to be unambiguous specify the device
[15:45:37] simonstewart: By using the advanced user interaction APIs
[15:45:54] RossPatterson: Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practise to abstract :-)
[15:46:07] simonstewart: This stuff is easy right now :)
[15:46:10] simonstewart: Here's how i think of it
[15:46:31] simonstewart: WebElement.click() == "I want to simulate something clicking or tapping that thing. I don't care how"
[15:46:48] simonstewart: Actions.click() (with the other actions bundled in too) == "I want to click on that thing with a mouse"
[15:47:08] simonstewart: TouchActions.singleTap() == "I want to click on that thing as a touch device"
[15:47:20] simonstewart: See. Simple
[15:47:31] zeljkof has joined #selenium
[15:47:35] simonstewart: If I care what the device is, I never want to use WEbElement.click()
[15:47:51] SamG: Yes agreed, tbh I was only middy aware of Actions
[15:47:53] SamG: *midly
[15:47:57] simonstewart: :)
[15:48:01] SamG: *mildly damnit
[15:48:20] simonstewart: We added them precisely because WebElement didn't offer a great deal of control but was mostly enough
[15:48:32] simonstewart: In the common case, I _don't_ care how user input is done
[15:48:47] testingb0t1 has joined #selenium

[16:01:49] andreastt: The new test system I've designed gets too many test results.

[16:04:14] dude-x: cgoldberg: what's fun about London is learning all the different British name things. Instead of "Exit" there is "Way Out"; instead of "Watch the gap" its "Mind the Gap" and other little differences

[16:58:03] regex: RossPatterson: Unfortunately it's required for the type of testing I'm assigned
[16:58:06] jimevans: regex: think very very very carefully about why you want to download files. RossPatterson is right, go read that blog post right now.
[16:58:19] regex: jimevans: I can't convince my boss of that...
[16:58:31] jimevans: have *him/her* go read that blog post, right now.
[16:58:37] Ardesco: regex: that blog post also tells you how to do it

[16:59:04] RossPatterson: Really, you need to read it, not just say "But I have to."
[16:59:11] lukeis: as another option isn't there a profile setting with firefox to auto download files to directory x?
[16:59:32] Ardesco: yup, but if you do that you probably aren't testing the file download process
[16:59:38] simonstewart: regex: what kind of testing have you been assigned?
[16:59:41] Ardesco: just downloading stuff to a folder that you never look at
[16:59:43] Ardesco: :)
[16:59:52] RossPatterson: Ardesco's argument (like jimevans' and mine) is that it's a bad idea, but he gives you a variety of options if you disagree.

[17:00:54] regex: RossPatterson: thanks
[17:01:00] Ardesco: existence of a file is no guarantee it is the fully downloaded copy of it
[17:01:06] simonstewart: And how do you ensure that all the downloads are okay?
[17:01:09] lukeis: i think it does with ff
[17:01:13] RossPatterson: Thank Ardesco - it's his blog :-)
[17:01:48] simonstewart: Ardesco: let's follow this one through. Maybe there's another way to verify the unverifiable
[17:01:56] regex: simonstewart: Past developer used a file compare string.  Just comparing the download exists in the directory via string comparison.
[17:02:08] Ardesco: it's definitely an option lukeis, but I would rather get an http status code to tell me what happened when I requested the file than guess based on whether a file is or is not in the down load folder
[17:02:11] simonstewart: "Testing all downloads work" is a pretty broad concept
[17:02:21] regex: Ardesco: I totally agree.  Hash would be the best utility to ensure the integrity of the file
[17:02:23] Ardesco: and also you have to make sure you remember to clear out the download folder after the test
[17:02:38] Ardesco: or you will get a bunch of false positives when you run the test again and the file is already there
[17:02:40] lukeis: Ardesco: i know :) /me doesn't actually ever download anything either
[17:02:44] simonstewart: regex: then I'd only run the download tests in firefox and I'd set all the settings to always save everything automatically to the same directory
[17:03:03] simonstewart: I'd also mention to Those In Charge that the test is worthless, since you only know that _something_ was downloaded
[17:03:08] simonstewart: but not "what" was downloaded
[17:04:09] Ardesco: IMHO "Testing all downloads work" just shows that somebody doesn't really understand the concept of testing
[17:04:23] regex: Are you guys advocating hash compare.  Are you saying that's a useless test even if you're going to the ends of the earth to ensure 'what' was downloaded?
[17:04:39] Ardesco: it should be "prove to me that the download process works correctly and give me a high level of confidence that it will always give the user the file we expect it to"
[17:05:09] simonstewart: If you're going to the ends of the earth, it may be okay. 
[17:05:12] regex: Ardesco: We are testing 'what' was downloaded.  We are just doing it currently in a minimal way.  That the file names and URL's are right.  
[17:05:23] simonstewart: THough I'd suggest it's better as an integration test of the component that generate the download
[17:05:37] simonstewart: (Browsers are pretty good at this "downloading stuff of the Web" thing)
[17:05:58] Ardesco: regex my default position is what would you do if the download doesn't work
[17:06:14] Ardesco: can you fix the browser if it's broken
[17:06:19] Ardesco: can you force a browser release
[17:06:22] regex: simonstewart: Perhaps I didn't communicate the intricacies clearly.  Yes, dialogs ALWAYS work.  We are not testing a browser dialog.  But we need to be able to handle the download in order to test 'what' was downloaded.
[17:06:31] Ardesco: can you make your users use the version of the browser with the fix
[17:06:40] jimevans: regex: i would submit that you're *not* actually testing what was downloading. you know you downloaded *something*, and that it has a file name you expect, but you've no idea if you've actually downloaded anything remotely approaching the correct bits.
[17:06:59] regex: Ardesco: Yes, I push the button to release new Chrome versions :)  
[17:07:15] simonstewart: regex: sure. I heard that. :) I was suggesting that there was a component of your system responsible for creating the thing that's downloaded. I'd be keen to write an integration test around that component, and that component alone.
[17:07:29] simonstewart: But the other crazy idea I suggested would also work :)
[17:07:39] simonstewart: As would the suggestions on Ardesco's blog post
[17:07:51] jimevans: regex: and if all you're working to do is make sure that "link to URL 'foo' points to a file with contents 'bar'", you really don't need a browser to do that.
[17:08:13] regex: jimevans: It's just a pain to do a hash compare.  It's like using excavator to dig a hole instead of using a shovel. 
[17:08:18] Ardesco: then why are you using selenium to check that the chrome download dialogue works?
[17:08:19] Ardesco: :)
[17:09:06] simonstewart: OK chaps. I'm off
[17:09:07] jimevans: regex: depends on how big the hole you want is.
[17:09:12] simonstewart: regex: best of luck with your testing
[17:09:32] regex: You guys are a lot of help.  You push me to my limit though and add work to my overworked schedule...
[17:09:36] simonstewart: Everyone here is genuinely trying to help, I can promise you)
[17:10:09] Ardesco: well i would submit you don't need to test every file download
[17:10:23] *lukeis may try to sabotage tho ;)
[17:10:28] Ardesco: just one file through each functional path of the site that would produce a file download
[17:10:40] Ardesco: which means there shouldn't be that many file to perform a hash match on

[19:10:44] santiycr: jimevans:  just noticed all the IE specific caps that cover the IEDriver config. Thanks
[19:11:17] santiycr: one thing I noticed is the IE caps are the only ones that are not namespaced to IE: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities#IE_specific
[19:12:00] santiycr: the chrome, opera and safari specific caps, all start with browsername.capability
[19:12:12] jimevans: santiycr: what the client code should do is use InternetExplorerOptions, adding the sauce-specific caps to the options using AddAdditionalCapability(), then pass options.ToCapabilities() to the remote constructor.
[19:12:15] santiycr: s/start with/follow the pattern/
[19:12:44] santiycr: oh, interesting 
[19:13:35] santiycr: ok, I'll try to make this work and put it in the iedriver wiki
[19:13:55] jimevans: ToCapabilities() returns ICapabilities, rather than DesiredCapabilities, so you have to start with the options class, and add additional caps there, rather than the other way 'round.
[19:14:37] santiycr: yeah, was wondering if I could use DesiredCaps and then merge whatever ieoptions gave me back
[19:15:03] andreastt: santiycr: The so called pattern with using the browser name as a prefix is just because noone have really gotten around to synchronize them yet.
[19:15:30] santiycr: jimevans: not a fan of asking people to add random capabilities into the InternetExplorerOptions object
[19:15:36] santiycr: not that it matters much :)
[19:15:38] andreastt: It's easier to say, I'm going to smack "opera." in front so that I know it won't conflict.
[19:15:59] santiycr: andreastt:  makes it for a nice separation nevertheless 
[19:16:06] barancev: in web interface for git there is no "newer" link to navigate through the list of commits, you can go to "older" ones only :(
[19:16:06] andreastt: For some things of course.
[19:16:08] jimevans: santiycr: but you're asking them to do it to DesiredCapabilities. not sure i see the differenc.e
[19:16:38] andreastt: I started out supporting proxy as opera.proxy, then later changed the code to support the base proxy capability.
[19:17:02] andreastt: So it could be thought of in similar terms as CSS vendor prefixes.
[19:17:45] santiycr: jimevans:  that's what DesiredCapabilities are for. General capabilities used to drive the browser
[19:18:28] santiycr: also, asking them to add them to IEOptions instead of desired caps, means they need to duplicate a bunch of code and special case it for whenever IE is being run
[19:18:50] santiycr: and by that, I'm talking about the desired capabilities setup
[19:20:21] jimevans: as a .NET developer, i hate DesiredCapabilities. a string, object dictionary? with no type safety? ugh.
[19:20:49] santiycr: heh
[19:20:49] jimevans: that's why the options classes exist in the first place.
[19:20:55] santiycr: as a python developer, I'm home
[19:21:07] jimevans: to provide type safety for the options you want that would ordinarily go in DesiredCapabilities.
[19:21:40] santiycr: I see
[19:22:15] jimevans: but it would be a simple matter to change .ToCapabilities() to return DesiredCapabilities instead of ICapabilities, which would solve the problem too.
[19:23:15] jimevans: it would just mean to get your base capabilities object, you'd call "new InternetExplorerOptions().ToCapabilities() instead of DesiredCapabilities.InternetExplorer().

[19:31:04] andreastt: jimevans: I did something similar with capabilities for the OperaDriver.
[19:31:20] rbalent has joined #selenium
[19:32:02] andreastt: To make a long story short, I was tired of having to do type and value checks on the key/value string capabilities storage every time I used them.  It also frequently caused conflicts internally as some of the capabilities were evaluated at driver initialization.
[19:32:16] jimevans: exactly so.
[19:32:36] andreastt: So once the OperaDriver receives a set of capabilities, they are immediately converted into an OperaSettings object (much similar to IEOptions and ChromeOptions I believe).
[19:32:49] link15: thanks for the help lukeis :)
[19:32:52] andreastt: The OperaSettings has #toCapabilities() which returns a Capabilities object.
[19:33:12] jimevans: for strongly-typed languages, having opaque blobby type data structures is inelegant.
[19:33:31] andreastt: Yes, especially when you can't guarantee what the user sends you.
[19:33:39] andreastt: If they make a mistake, they'll end up blaming you
[19:33:55] jimevans: yep! :)
[19:34:22] link15 has left #selenium
[19:34:23] andreastt: Besides, things like capabilities objects is hard to get right in a typechecked language.
[19:34:39] andreastt: Like, you might be able to get DesiredCapabilities.InternetExplorer right.
[19:34:46] andreastt: But getting the Proxy thing right is a nightmare.
[19:35:45] mac-convert: We just converted over to Selenium 2.28 from 2.24 (using Java) and the IEDriverServer.exe appears to be the cause for slowness that we are now seeing.  We see tests take about 25-30% longer than with the older driver.  Any ideas?
[19:36:48] jimevans: mac-convert: what OS are you running the IEDriverServer on?
[19:37:09] mac-convert: jimevans: Win2k8.
[19:37:39] jimevans: i've heard reports that running on server OSes may cause a perf hit.
[19:37:57] mac-convert: jimevans: I am seeing the same slowness on Win7 as well
[19:38:40] mac-convert: though I can't say what the performance of 2.24 was on Win7, I just tried Win7 for comparison purposes.
[19:38:57] nirvdrum: krosenvold_: I think there was a CRLF issue with an IDEA file that Simon committed.  Dunno if you care on those.
[19:40:48] mac-convert: why do we need the IEDriverServer.exe in 2.28 when in 2.24 it wasn't required?
[19:41:01] dhpe: anyone going to the selenium meetup in SF tonight?
[19:41:07] mac-convert: I would think spinning up a new process and requiring IPC would make things slower
[19:41:14] jimevans: mac-convert: http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/11/are-you-kidding-me-ie-driver-another.html
[19:42:14] jimevans: mac-convert: the dirty little secret is that you were doing IPC via HTTP calls even without the separate .exe.
[19:43:00] krosenvold_: nirvdrum: Not *that* much 
[19:43:10] mac-convert: jimevans: but isn't this an extra IPC hop?  sure you were doing HTTP to the browser, but now it's HTTP to IEDriverServer to the browser, right?
[19:43:21] mac-convert: jimevans: reading your blog post
[19:43:39] jimevans: mac-convert: nope, it was HTTP to the IEDriver.dll to the browser before.
[19:44:40] nirvdrum: krosenvold_: Well, glad you fixed it before it became a big issue.  Some take the stance that it shouldn't be a project setting but rather an individual developer setting.
[19:45:27] krosenvold_: Bah. It's a PITA when it goes wrong
[19:46:58] jimevans: contrary to public opinion, it's rare that i make a change to either the IE driver or the .net bindings without having *some* reason for doing so.
[19:47:10] mac-convert: jimevans: ok, assuming that the EXE isn't making things any slower, could there be anything else that would make it slower?
[19:47:35] *lukeis <3 jimevans
[19:47:50] mac-convert: jimevans: I'm certain you do, it's all good :-)
[19:48:09] *jimevans is fighting the perception that he only makes changes to the IE driver or the bindings to inconvenience users. :)
[19:48:38] lukeis: that's the only reason *I* code :)
[19:49:27] AutomatedTester: krosenvold_: I dont have it set
[19:49:42] mac-convert: jimevans: do you have a suggestion to help make things a bit faster or maybe a log file I can look at?  because our test suite for IE takes over 24 hours (before the upgrade from 2.24 to 2.28)
[19:49:44] AutomatedTester: barancev: the MD5SUMS are up now
[19:50:16] jimevans: mac-convert: could be any number of things, from a slow down in one of the javascript automation atoms, to a change in the native event code that i didn't expect, to whatever.
[19:50:40] mac-convert: jimevans: so if I extrapolate the new time, maybe it'll take 30 hours instead… 
[19:50:44] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[19:50:48] AutomatedTester: one slow down is the ability to support CSS Transforms
[19:50:57] jimevans: mac-convert: what kind of log file are you asking for?
[19:50:59] AutomatedTester: that has come in between 2.24 and 2.28
[19:51:03] krosenvold_: AutomatedTester: It does not matter any more. I have set it for you ;)

[19:51:45] jimevans: RossPatterson: indeed :)
[19:51:58] _kW has joined #selenium
[19:52:21] mac-convert: AutomatedTester: what kind of slowdown is expected there?  not sure if we're using CSS transforms
[19:52:25] RossPatterson: mac-convert: :changelog
[19:52:26] selbot2_: .NET: http://goo.gl/SL88L | Java: http://goo.gl/50JPE | Ruby: http://goo.gl/K9ayk | Python: http://goo.gl/Ikm8u | IDE: http://goo.gl/tm4FM
[19:52:32] RossPatterson: ^^^
[19:52:44] AutomatedTester: mac-convert: the selenium code checks for CSS transforms as part of its visibility checks
[19:52:51] AutomatedTester: which means it needs to walk the DOM 
[19:53:15] AutomatedTester: hmmm wanted to ask jleyba a question about how we could optimise
[19:53:25] jimevans: RossPatterson: yeah, but that doesn't include the IEDriverServer change log. which is at http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/cpp/IEDriverServer/CHANGELOG
[19:53:42] RossPatterson: Time for a selbot2 code patch!
[19:54:08] jimevans: oooh, and the selbot change log links point to svn! 
[19:54:14] AutomatedTester: I wonder if we could do a memoization of elements we find in the visibility checks and just walk what we store a long the way...
[19:54:25] mac-convert: AutomatedTester: if we're not using CSS transforms, would it not make things slower unless we did?
[19:54:35] lukeis: yeah, selbot2_ needs a lot of patches
[19:54:53] AutomatedTester: mac-convert: webdriver wouldnt know you arent using CSS Transforms so walks anyway
[19:55:08] lukeis: svn -> git has a lot of subtleties that we need to iron out
[19:55:13] jimevans: i wonder if de-atomizing the IE driver would make it any faster.
[19:55:18] *jimevans shudders at the thought.
[19:55:31] jimevans: because i know it almost certainly would.
[19:55:34] AutomatedTester: TIL I learnt that Facebook moved from GIT to Mercurial for speed reasons
[19:55:40] mac-convert: AutomatedTester: so it'll cause slowness even if I'm not using CSS transforms maybe
[19:56:08] AutomatedTester: "maybe"
[19:56:14] jimevans: mac-convert: what version of IE are you using?
[19:56:29] mac-convert: jimevans: do you guys do any benchmarking to compare performance across releases?
[19:56:33] AutomatedTester: mac-convert: also using IE X64 will cause slowness
[19:56:36] AutomatedTester: since the JS JIT is optimized for x86
[19:56:38] mac-convert: jimevans: IE9
[19:56:43] jimevans: mac-convert: benchmarking? hahahahahahahaha
[19:57:04] jimevans: mac-convert: sorry. 
[19:57:04] mac-convert: jimevans: or anything to decide if things get slower?  
[19:57:16] jimevans: mac-convert: patches most welcome.
[19:57:18] lukeis: s/hahahahhahahahaha/were not quite there yet :)/
[19:57:37] lukeis: s/were/we're/
[19:57:58] AutomatedTester: s/we're not quite there yet/thats up to the browser vendors soon/
[19:58:04] mac-convert: jimevans: that'll come in 3.0 right ;-)
[19:58:05] jimevans: mac-convert: make sure you're using 32-bit IE9. that's seriously the biggest perf gain you'll have.

[20:00:24] jimevans: if you're using the 32-bit IEDriverServer, then yes, you are. :)
[20:00:53] mac-convert: jimevans: my point was, you said use 32-bit IE, and we are..
[20:01:26] mac-convert: jimevans: do you have a day job like the rest of us?  selenium is pretty good, must take a lot of someone's efforts
[20:01:29] jimevans: mac-convert: yes, i get that. and *my* point is that if your language runtime in 2.24 was 64-bit, you weren't.
[20:01:39] jimevans: mac-convert: indeed i do.
[20:01:55] mac-convert: jimevans: bowing - thank you!
[20:02:09] lukeis: mac-convert: everyone on this project has day-jobs ;)
[20:02:09] jimevans: which is why i'm so quick to say "patches welcome" rather than just going off to do it myself.
[20:02:26] jimevans: the selenium project is all-volunteer\
[20:02:47] mac-convert: jimevans: are you talking about 64-bit Java or the .NET runtime?
[20:02:54] jimevans: mac-convert: either.
[20:03:21] mac-convert: jimevans: ok, so if on the client-side we're using 64-bit Java, with a 32-bit IE, could that cause slowness?
[20:03:31] mac-convert: jimevans: re: patches, understood
[20:03:53] AutomatedTester: mac-convert: and limit the getText() calls to smaller items
[20:03:53] AutomatedTester: getText() on a <table> will be very very slow
[20:03:53] AutomatedTester: since it needs to walk the DOM for text collection and for visibility
[20:03:54] a1g has joined #selenium
[20:03:59] jimevans: mac-convert: not likely, given the ipc mechanism.
[20:04:13] jimevans: (which is http)
[20:04:33] jimevans: were you using a 64-bit jvm with 2.24, and not using the IEDriverServer?
[20:04:37] mac-convert: jimevans: just trying to understand what 32-bit vs. 64-bit has to do with slowness then
[20:05:05] jimevans: ah, because the updated javascript engine for IE9 that used JIT compilation wasn't available in 64-bit IE9, only 32-bit
[20:05:29] mac-convert: jimevans: got it
[20:06:05] mac-convert: jimevans: I believe we're using a 64-bit JVM (not sure).  But for sure, with 2.24, we were not using IEDriverServer
[20:06:43] mac-convert: jimevans: are we forced to use IEDriverServer in 2.28 (stupid question maybe, just making sure)
[20:06:54] jimevans: mac-convert: yep.
[20:07:03] jimevans: for all the reasons mentioned in the blog post.
[20:07:12] mac-convert: jimevans: right

[23:38:57] lukeis: i wouldn't go that far
[23:39:15] lukeis: i was able to export to webdriver from it
[23:39:48] lukeis: davehunt: mind doing me a favor… go here https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/3  and see if you have a 'reopen' button at the bottom? (I want to confirm permissions)
[23:40:01] sayd: lukeis: it seems to only support selenium 1, does that cover webdriver?
[23:40:11] lukeis: no
[23:40:18] davehunt: lukeis: I don't see reopen
[23:40:19] lukeis: and it supports selenium 2
[23:40:23] lukeis: davehunt: k, thx
[23:41:40] lukeis: :note krosenvold_ the way the team is setup i don't think they can close pull requests (just pull access doesn't allow them to reopen issues at least, don't have an open pull request to confirm, that's why i set it to pull&push originally)
[23:41:42] selbot2_: ok!
[23:42:34] lukeis: :note krosenvold_ remember you are an 'owner' :)
[23:42:35] selbot2_: ok!
[23:47:00] sayd: lukeis: ok i think i got a suite/test/steps <-- what is that anyways in selenium-speak? to export to python. i have other tests though and don't see a way to export my whole collection (the thing the builder loads) as a python file

[23:49:09] lukeis: sayd: i don't know… you might have to export each one individually
[23:49:28] lukeis: i would hope there's a mechanism to do the whole thing
[23:49:34] lukeis: but i honestly have no idea ;)

[23:55:53] sayd: lukeis: yeah, im sure it shouldnt be this difficult to get going
[23:58:28] sayd: is selenium2 a subset of features supported by selenium 1?
[23:58:58] lukeis: other way around
[23:59:04] lukeis: gtg, 'night
