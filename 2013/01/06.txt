[04:02:00] jost: I'm trying to make the webdriver wait for all images on a page to be loaded... This is how I've tried it: http://pastebin.com/yGAzibyY
[04:02:28] jost: The problem is that nodes seem to go into endless loops when they are faced with this.
[04:03:14] jost: but only when the node is an IE-node.
[04:03:20] jost: Version 7-9
[04:03:50] lukeis: have you tried that javascript directly on IE?
[04:05:56] jost: yes
[04:06:54] lukeis: set a break point in your test and see where it is looping forever?
[04:09:36] jost: its the wait.until-part. The javascript is sent to the node over and over again
[04:10:43] lukeis: which would imply the function is always evaluating to false, assuming you didn't set an infinite timeout, it does timeout right?
[04:13:51] jost: it does time out... 
[04:18:57] lukeis: so, the question becomes why is it always evaluating to false. some images not 'complete'? And IE can be a hassle in this regard (UI bugs), I don't recall exactly all the inconsistencies around image loading with IE
[04:20:51] jost: lukeis, yes, you got the problem...
[04:21:20] jost: there is an img-tag with src="". It is regarded as complete by all browsers except IE.
[04:21:49] lukeis: ah, that will cause IE to request an 'img' at the same location as the page
[04:22:22] lukeis: i think it considers that incomplete or something when it gets the html back as a response
[04:23:02] lukeis: i would call that a UI bugâ€¦ shouldn't have a <img src=""> on the page because of that issue
[04:28:32] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[04:30:03] jost: Seems so... but changing it is not realistic for now, because I'm building tests to prepare for refactorings... so I've just added a check for an empty src-element. That works in IE > 7, but IE 7 returns the directory of the current element.
[04:30:57] enbergj has joined #selenium
[04:32:59] lukeis: that would make sense, i would special case the check for <= IE7 that would check the current url too
[04:33:24] lukeis: driver.getCurrentUrl() :)
[04:35:07] jost: I'm checking if the src-attribute ends with '/', that should work too

[21:41:27] cgoldberg: lukeis, no.. it works awesome :)  i just blogged about it.. was playting with it this afternoon
[21:41:37] lukeis: coolio ;)

[21:41:59] lukeis: meh, i basically copied the chrome code
[21:42:06] lukeis: :)
[21:43:24] lukeis: cgoldberg: just reading your blog, you don't need to build the source yourself, the latest release (pre-compiled phantomjs 1.8) works 
[21:43:28] lukeis: with webdriver
[21:43:41] cgoldberg: lukeis, sweet!.. i'll update the post
[21:44:22] cgoldberg: i was going by the GhostFriver docs
