[00:03:24] jimevans: why? i'd never use it for running my tests in production, but for doing one-off checking of a single test method while i'm developing it, it seems tailor-made for that.

[05:55:59] crazysaurabh: Hey 
[05:56:05] crazysaurabh: is anyone there ?
[05:56:15] crazysaurabh: Need basic help
[05:56:22] crazysaurabh: driver.execute_script("for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++ ){ " + " print i ; " + "}");
[05:56:27] crazysaurabh: stucks ...
[05:56:33] crazysaurabh: doesn't  returns 
[05:57:41] lukeis: i would expect that to throw an exception
[05:58:00] crazysaurabh: it doesn't  through any exception 
[05:58:07] lukeis: which browser?
[05:58:11] crazysaurabh: chrome
[05:59:11] crazysaurabh: could you please give me example how this excute_Script works?
[05:59:50] lukeis: so what's going on with your script is invalid syntax of JSâ€¦ chrome should be throwing but it's not (it's behaving badly, that's bug in chromedriver)
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Jan  9 06:00:04 2013]

[06:00:45] crazysaurabh: yeah i know this 
[06:00:55] enbergj has joined #selenium
[06:00:55] lukeis: ok, so what do you want to do? :)
[06:01:04] crazysaurabh: but can you give me one example applying for loop in JS 
[06:01:13] crazysaurabh: using chrome driver
[06:01:16] lukeis: that was close
[06:01:59] lukeis: driver.execute_script("for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++ ){ console.log(i); }");
[06:02:15] crazysaurabh: it don't prints anything 
[06:02:20] crazysaurabh: already tried
[06:02:25] lukeis: open up the console
[06:03:22] crazysaurabh: Works on google chrome console
[06:03:32] crazysaurabh: but what about python command line 
[06:03:41] lukeis: what do you want to do?
[06:04:15] lukeis: you can't print to the python console in a for loop in the javascript executing remotely
[06:04:28] crazysaurabh: Need to print few information
[06:04:28] lukeis: you can return an array and then iterate in python
[06:04:37] crazysaurabh: OK 
[06:04:42] crazysaurabh: Let me try that 
[06:05:00] lukeis: items = driver.execute_script("return [0,1,2];");   for item in items: print item
[06:05:18] Ardesc0_H: if you don't have return anywhere you wont see a response
[06:05:26] Ardesc0_H: caught me out before
[06:05:57] lukeis: Ardesc0_H: why are you awake? ;)
[06:06:10] Ardesc0_H: this is what time i get up to go to work
[06:06:11] Ardesc0_H: :)
[06:06:24] Ardesc0_H: well actually i got up 40 mins ago
[06:06:32] lukeis: good lord..
[06:06:43] lukeis: meh, i guess i get up at 6am too
[06:06:50] Ardesc0_H: the joys of working in London and living nowhere near London ;)
[06:07:46] lukeis: how long is your commute?
[06:08:20] crazysaurabh: thanks man 
[06:08:26] crazysaurabh: You are just awesome 
[06:09:22] Ardesc0_H: 2-2.5 hours
[06:09:27] Ardesc0_H: depending on trains and connections
[06:09:28] JackDandy has joined #selenium
[06:09:59] lukeis: good lordâ€¦ wifi on the train? or you bring your own?
[06:11:08] Ardesc0_H: wifi is intermittant as is mobile phone service on the train
[06:11:20] Ardesc0_H: I normally nap or read through twitter
[06:11:32] Ardesc0_H: it/'s not so bad
[06:11:39] Ardesc0_H: drive -> train -> underground
[06:11:42] lukeis: i assume you are current en route?
[06:11:48] Ardesc0_H: so the drive part i'm occupied
[06:12:04] Ardesc0_H: nope sitting on my arse for 20 mins until i have to go
[06:12:09] lukeis: ha
[06:12:17] Ardesc0_H: i'm normally up a little early so i'm not late for the train
[06:12:53] lukeis: ah, guess i'm lucky with a train every 15 min
[06:12:54] Ardesc0_H: and also if i'm not out the shower by 06:10 i'll get nagged at because my wife wants to get in thre
[06:13:09] Ardesc0_H: our overground trains are stupid
[06:13:36] lukeis: i think i've seen a few complaints via twitter from you :)
[06:13:41] Ardesc0_H: 3 trains leave over a period of about 30 mins, they all arrive within 1 min of each other in London
[06:13:55] Ardesc0_H: so not much point in getting an earlier train
[06:14:04] lukeis: that is quite dumb
[06:14:14] Ardesc0_H: yeah that will be me bitching at the railway, only way you get a response is to moan about them in public
[06:15:07] Ardesc0_H: the earlier trains stop at more stations so i know why they arrive about the same time
[06:15:22] lukeis: yeah, local and then express
[06:15:30] Ardesc0_H: but it's still pretty dumb, mad rush for the underground as 3 trains arrive at almost the same time
[06:15:40] lukeis: cal train is like that here, you can get on a later train and arrive earlier ;)
[06:15:47] Ardesc0_H: heh
[06:16:14] Ardesc0_H: read Simon's blog about people having a clue yesterday
[06:16:30] Ardesc0_H: and by that measure I think Selenium is about as popular as it's going to get
[06:16:32] lukeis: bart on the other hand is pretty set :)
[06:16:46] Ardesc0_H: I get more frustrated looking at the mailing lists these days than anything else
[06:16:57] lukeis: i stopped reading the se-users list
[06:17:31] *Ardesc0_H is considering adding "do the needful" to a profanity filter
[06:17:54] Ardesc0_H: there a a few sane ones still
[06:18:12] Ardesc0_H: a huge amount of peopel wanting you to write thier code for them with no details
[06:18:24] lukeis: yeah, before i stopped reading i would just ignore all posts at the hours i slept (since most came from a certain country)
[06:18:32] Ardesc0_H: followed by loads of people guessing at what they want and throwing out random code solutions
[06:18:51] Ardesc0_H: (usually bad)

[06:20:02] Ardesc0_H: which i suspect will fix all problems for him
[06:20:20] lukeis: ah yeah, forgot jenkins had that nice option
[06:20:22] Ardesc0_H: Jenkins has got pretty user freindly recently
[06:20:37] *lukeis doesn't use too many headless boxes
[06:20:55] Ardesc0_H: I normally just check that anyway for linux boxes now
[06:21:37] lukeis: i'm currently working with mobile, so most of ours are mac boxesâ€¦ iOS the 'open' platform ;)
[06:21:45] Ardesc0_H: hah
[06:21:56] Ardesc0_H: i had hell with Safari on OSX
[06:22:10] Ardesc0_H: don't really want to deal with it on iOS
[06:22:29] lukeis: others are dealing for you ;)
[06:22:44] Ardesc0_H: I started trying to write the Actions class tstuff for Safari driver
[06:22:46] lukeis: https://github.com/freynaud/ios-driver  <- the future
[06:22:48] Ardesc0_H: but haven't got far yet
[06:23:08] Ardesc0_H: keep getting pulled away onto other things
[06:23:26] Ardesc0_H: is that where he is hooking into the webkit console?
[06:23:33] lukeis: yes
[06:23:41] lukeis: remote inspector protocol ;)
[06:24:14] Ardesc0_H: looking good :)
[06:24:56] lukeis: franÃ§ois is definitely one of those really good kind of crazy programmers ;) he can get a lot of shit done quickly
[06:26:08] *Ardesc0_H is jealous
[06:26:23] lukeis: the lack of a readme should be frightening though (he doesn't document much) :)
[06:26:23] Ardesc0_H: I'm more of a lets try get this dne it would be really use... ooo shiney
[06:26:40] lukeis: ;)
[06:27:08] lukeis: i end up have 5 things going on at once and thus the take 10 times as long to get done
[06:31:19] Ardesc0_H: righty off i go
[06:31:22] Ardesc0_H: catch you later
[06:31:28] lukeis: later, when i wake up ;)

[14:16:09] freynaud: I'm looking for the magic param, hold on

[14:27:25] simonstewart: dawagner: thanks for the fix
[14:27:35] dawagner: Sorry for the breakage!
[14:28:06] dawagner: simonstewart: How much are you going to hit me if I want to add an extensibility hook to the standalone server?
[14:28:22] simonstewart: Depends on what and where
[14:28:59] dawagner: Grid has a -servlets param which lets one register extra servlets (as long as they're on the classpath)
[14:29:07] simonstewart: k
[14:29:21] dawagner: Something like that.  Maybe with a home-brewed interface rather than the servlets interface, beacuse we may want to stay servlet-independent
[14:30:18] simonstewart: We already have a wrapper for http requests and responses
[14:33:26] dawagner: So how about a -httpservers param, which takes a list of fully qualified class names to attempt to register as Interface<doGet(HttpRequest,HttpResponse>, doPost(HttpRequest,HttpResponse)> and wire through to jetty?

[14:34:57] simonstewart: Our HttpRequest interface has a "getMethod" on it

[14:35:43] freynaud: dawagner: forget about the resource thing.It's a / missing , it should pass now

[16:22:41] AutomatedTester: this is what every app on OSX does except for when in a google text area
[16:22:51] AutomatedTester: then they remove the defaults and just ignore it
[16:23:25] AutomatedTester: then i need to move my mouse, instead of using keyboard shortcuts, to get to the beginning of a line
[16:23:38] AutomatedTester: or holding left arrow until its at the beginning of the line
[16:23:47] dawagner: On the other hand, doing so breaks the default browser behaviour...
[16:24:32] AutomatedTester: dawagner: in a vanilla text area in firefox it goes to the beginning of the line
[16:24:42] dawagner: But when not in a text area, firefox goes back a page
[16:24:48] AutomatedTester: yea...
[16:25:04] AutomatedTester: my gripe is in the textarea of gmail

[16:44:50] jimevans: dawagner: this would be building on windows.
[16:44:50] regex: IIt's basically the same thing.  But I don't use common actions for that page within the page model.  Just the objects themselves. 
[16:45:23] jimevans: millenium: the FindsBy attribute isn't new, but what question do you have?

[16:50:39] jimevans: i prefer the page object to represent actions to be taken on the page. others prefer to just expose the elements on the page. there is room for disagreement among reasonable people as to which is the best approach. you'll need to decide what works for you.

[17:06:02] jdibbert: got a weird issue with possibly with web driver. It has to do with nested spans each with their own attributeâ€¦ because that is how content editable is created.
[17:06:35] jdibbert: web driver does not appear to be properly considering the nested styles
[17:06:50] jdibbert: has anyone else seen a issue with this?
[17:09:43] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[17:10:24] cmcgraw: additionally to jdibbert's issue, This isn't an issue for Chrome because Chrome applies all 3 styles to the 1 styling span.  We're using content editable to apply bold/underline/italic and trying to verify this with selenium.  Would be nice if firefox applied the styles rather than creating new spans for each.

[22:39:46] regex: jimevans: Okay.  I did.  The project is under source control so I have limited ability to make global changes.
[22:39:54] regex: jimevans: https://gist.github.com/4497707
[22:40:36] jimevans: regex: did the IEDriverServer.exe start? you'd see the command prompt for it open up if it did.
[22:41:12] AutomatedTester: oh hawt... I didnt realise https://saucelabs.com/u/AutomatedTester
[22:41:30] santiycr: open source users have that page available for everyone
[22:41:31] regex: jimevans: It starts under the latest version and gives the same error it did originally.
[22:41:44] jimevans: regex: remember that you can specify exactly where the IEDriverServer.exe is either in the constructor to the InternetExplorerDriverService or in the constructor to InternetExplorerDriver.exe
[22:41:44] santiycr: something in the selenium-ci account makes it lock the rest api, though
[22:42:00] santiycr: jimevans:  do you know the creds to login as selenium-ci in our service?
[22:42:22] jimevans: santiycr: i do not, but that's okay. i'm about out of time anyway.
[22:43:11] jimevans: regex: the log for the IE driver server is far more important. the "no response from server" exception is exactly what I'd expect to see if the executable crashed.
[22:43:12] santiycr: jimevans:  which jobs are you looking for?
[22:43:24] santiycr: I can see them myself so I may be able to point you to the right ones
[22:43:45] jimevans: santiycr: any of the IE jobs from, say, the last couple of hours.

[22:45:10] santiycr: The Raw Log there has the info you're looking for, I think
[22:45:38] santiycr: FWIW, we serve this raw log via our rest api, so we could build a mechanism for the tests to pull and store it
[22:46:27] jimevans: santiycr: thanks for that mate. you've confirmed for me what i've already suspected.
[22:48:13] regex: jimevans: It does start.  It opens IE but than the unhandled exception prompt displays
[22:49:24] jimevans: :note dawagner your change in r18438 did not seem to resolve the hudsuckr.exe extraction issue. we're still seeing timeouts on the IE jobs on sauce.
[22:49:26] selbot2_: ok!
[22:49:27] selbot2_: 03dawagner about 4 hours ago - DanielWagnerHall: Extract hudsuckr as a file, not a path to a file.  The extractor does all sorts of funky things depending on whether the {resource being extracted,destination} are {files,directories}.  All other usages have been checked, and are directories being copied to directories (which get flattened), as opposed to files being copied to directories (which get subdirs made ...

[23:12:48] detronizator: lukeis: hey
[23:12:58] lukeis: hey
[23:13:00] detronizator: can I pick revert a previous comment and pick your brain?
[23:13:11] lukeis: sure
[23:13:24] detronizator: apparently Maven is a still a beast to tame for me :)
[23:13:33] lukeis: heh :)
[23:13:41] detronizator: PhantomJSDriver in Maven issue: I'm sure there is something I don't get
[23:13:42] detronizator: so
[23:13:43] *AutomatedTester points and laughs at detronizator
[23:13:45] lukeis: want me to create a pom?
[23:13:53] AutomatedTester: you java people...
[23:13:57] lukeis: and give instructions to upload?
[23:13:59] detronizator: no, I want to understand first :)
[23:14:03] AutomatedTester: lukeis: i think Ardesc0_H did one
[23:14:27] detronizator: why do I have to do this, given that the jar and the zip of Selenium release
[23:14:31] detronizator: contains my jar?
[23:14:43] detronizator: as in, the technical aspect, not the "responsibility" one
[23:15:08] detronizator: Ardesc0_H: did one?
[23:15:35] lukeis: you don't have to do it, i gave an answer in the selenium issue on how to do it oneself
[23:15:53] AutomatedTester: I thought Ardesc0_H did a pom for you
[23:16:10] AutomatedTester: I am mudding waters
[23:16:13] *AutomatedTester shuts up
[23:16:29] lukeis: it's a courtesy  to the maven users
[23:16:39] lukeis: AutomatedTester: he didn't end up doing it ;)
[23:16:44] detronizator: lukeis: no no, I do want to make their life easier
[23:16:57] detronizator: I don't understand why it's not automatical as part of the selenium jar
[23:17:21] AutomatedTester: detronizator: we dont package your jar inside our jar... we package it in the zip
[23:17:33] detronizator: 2 sec history: before putting the jar in "selenium/3rd_parties" I was about to create that pom in Sonatype pub repo
[23:17:47] detronizator: then gave up because I got the commit bit and the 3rd party jar thing
[23:18:03] AutomatedTester: detronizator: we package for non-maven users for you
[23:18:10] AutomatedTester: maven people are weird
[23:18:27] detronizator: AutomatedTester: u sure? I swear I did a "unzip l selenium.jar | grep phantom" and saw it
[23:18:32] detronizator: maybe I was high...
[23:18:39] lukeis: detronizator: that's correct
[23:18:42] AutomatedTester: detronizator: maybe I am currently high
[23:18:42] lukeis: but maven is different
[23:18:51] qaguy has left #selenium

[23:19:05] *detronizator ... or drunk
[23:19:17] detronizator: lukeis: take your time

[23:21:18] AutomatedTester: so makes my life a little sad
[23:22:05] detronizator: AutomatedTester: it's never good enough for you people at Mozilla :P
[23:22:17] AutomatedTester: detronizator: thats true
[23:22:17] detronizator: that's why you didn't hire me: I was good but not good enough :P
[23:22:36] AutomatedTester: detronizator: the way Mozilla hires baffles me
[23:23:03] AutomatedTester: I get in and people equal or better than me dont...
[23:24:31] detronizator: AutomatedTester: gosh - you are tired. I'm serving you the opportunity to tease me more and you don't take it?
[23:24:37] detronizator: I'm about to get sad myself now...
[23:24:38] detronizator: :)
[23:24:59] lukeis: detronizator: ok, so third party jars may be bundled in the standalone jar and the zip bundle, but maven (trunk/maven) has it's own packaging / deployment (to maven central) and we typically don't include third party since, well, they should already be in maven central on their own accord :)
[23:25:05] AutomatedTester: :)
[23:25:33] detronizator: lukeis: ah - so I need to do that thing at the end of the day
[23:25:40] detronizator: I see: how do I love maven...

[23:36:21] santiycr: lukeis: yt?
[23:36:26] lukeis: si
[23:36:58] santiycr: I noticed the java IPhoneDriver doesn't implement HasTouchScreen, was wondering if that's intended
[23:37:28] *lukeis checks what that interface does
[23:38:48] lukeis: santiycr: yeah, definitely doesn't implement that yet
[23:38:55] lukeis: https://github.com/Selenium2/Selenium2/blob/master/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/TouchScreen.java
[23:39:11] santiycr: oh, I see
[23:39:19] santiycr: hm, ok
[23:39:37] santiycr: I guess we shouldn't try to mask appium under the iPhoneDriver :)
[23:39:50] lukeis: absolutely not ;)
[23:40:02] lukeis: should be its own
[23:41:09] santiycr: yeah, I think I can make that happen without patching the Selenium jar
[23:41:28] santiycr: hm, or maybe I can just add it to trunk
[23:41:32] lukeis: why not add it?
[23:42:01] santiycr: how did you sub-classify ios driver between iphone and ipad via capabilities?
[23:42:15] friskd has joined #selenium
[23:43:11] santiycr: cuz I guess I need something similar, users being able to say "I want AppiumDriver on iPad
[23:45:25] lukeis: santiycr: that's just in the DesiredCapabilities object
[23:45:40] lukeis: define another one in there
[23:46:24] lukeis: overloaded browserName
[23:46:59] santiycr: alright, makes sense
[23:47:12] santiycr: we'll take care of the cleaning it up later
