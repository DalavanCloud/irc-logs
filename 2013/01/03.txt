[10:09:25] simonstewart: "Error: The JAVA_HOME environment variable is not set." Methinks this hasn't been tested on a Mac
[10:10:39] andreastt: Shouldn't be any substantial difference between Mac and Linux.
[10:10:46] andreastt: JAVA_HOME is rarely set on Linux.
[10:11:23] simonstewart: Indeed. But when it's needed, there's an assumption that the JDK layout is something very specific. Which isn't the case on the Mac
[10:11:34] andreastt: True.

[11:56:19] crazysaurabh: any idea?
[11:57:32] andreastt: simonstewart: Looks good, but make sure you use tabs and add "validate" to PHONY since it's not a file.
[11:59:21] andreastt: Also, you'd want to clean up the vnu.jar file.

[12:34:37] dawagner: Ugh, <script src=?> doesn't work when encoding a page as a data URL :(
[12:37:51] jimevans: dawagner: so what's the snag with app engine?
[12:38:34] dawagner: We currently have www.seleniumhq.org 301ing to seleniumhq.org
[12:38:50] dawagner: Appengine doesn't support naked domains, so www.seleniumhq.org would have to be our canonical site
[12:39:05] dawagner: But 301s are permanently cached, so making that switch would cause a redirect loop until a user clears their cache.
[12:42:24] dawagner: Some experimting showed that chrome will invalidate its cache in the face of a redirect loop, but firefox won't

[16:29:27] AutomatedTester: um...
[16:29:46] simonstewart: I bet that there's a command line switch to rebase which does the magic. 
[16:29:55] simonstewart: And I bet that switch depends on the command being executed.
[16:30:06] jarib: if i understand you correctly, `git pull --rebase origin master` should do the trick
[16:30:06] simonstewart: Because git loves to be as awkward as possible
[16:30:15] jarib: (whil on foo)
[16:30:18] jarib: *while
[16:30:35] simonstewart: I can try that.
[16:30:47] simonstewart: I've had exciting times with randomly disconnected heads
[16:30:52] AutomatedTester: git is less awkward than hg
[16:31:07] simonstewart: Not IME
[16:31:15] simonstewart: I've had far less grief from hg
[16:31:27] AutomatedTester: HG I find is terrible at merging
[16:31:41] AutomatedTester: basic things in git are plugins in HG
[16:31:50] simonstewart: I can live with plugins
[16:31:50] AutomatedTester: git > hg
[16:31:56] simonstewart: Large file support in hg is better
[16:32:06] AutomatedTester: that might be true

[16:44:58] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: same thing
[16:45:23] smccarthy: www.seleniumhq.com brings me to www.seleniumhq.org

[16:45:45] smccarthy: ok cool.
[16:46:01] simonstewart: OK. I'm going to head home in 10 minutes.
[16:46:14] lukeis: dawagner: why? :) or has it been figured out?
[16:46:31] simonstewart: Once there it'll be the night time routine for The Boy. I'll be logging in later to fix "stuff"
[16:46:48] simonstewart: dawagner: I'm interested too
[16:47:52] llaskin1: papa will read him a story?
[16:47:56] llaskin1: "the little tester that could"

[16:48:14] dude-x: redirect works
[16:48:24] AutomatedTester: I wonder if appengine is going to be upping its pricing again
[16:48:32] lukeis: routine is key for the little ones ;) especially when there are more than one
[16:48:50] AutomatedTester: routine has meant my boy sleeps ~12 hrs a night
[16:49:04] AutomatedTester: I cant complain too loudly
[16:49:41] *lukeis was up twice last night with the little one
[16:49:50] simonstewart: Amended the zone config. Let's see if that helps
[16:50:05] simonstewart: I got slightly under 4 hours sleep last night
[16:50:17] simonstewart: routine doesn't matter diddly if there are teeth coming through
[16:50:20] AutomatedTester: lukeis: did the 2nd one wake the first one?
[16:50:26] lukeis: nope
[16:50:33] lukeis: the oldest seems to sleep through it all
[16:50:37] *AutomatedTester hopes he gets that too

[16:51:45] llaskin1: no kids:-P
[16:51:46] dawagner: lukeis, simonstewart: So, we currently 301 www.seleniumhq.org to seleniumhq.org
[16:51:50] simonstewart: The Boy is on tooth 5. He's expressing displeasure about the state of the world. You have my sympathy, lukeis 
[16:51:51] AutomatedTester: llaskin1: I am glad you dont have kids too
[16:51:56] llaskin1: thanks asshat.

[16:51:58] simonstewart: dawagner: that's what we want
[16:52:07] simonstewart: Or rather, that's what we had before
[16:52:13] dawagner: Appengine doesn't support naked domains, so we'd need to have seleniumhq.org 301 to something else.
[16:52:21] simonstewart: I can point www to the app engine instance
[16:52:23] dawagner: If that thing is www., we'll have an infinite redirect loop
[16:52:37] simonstewart: dawagner: how come? 
[16:52:48] simonstewart: We have control over the DNS entries :)
[16:52:53] dawagner: Browsers permamently cache 301s
[16:53:02] lukeis: ok, then we need to change www. to not redirect and naked to redirect to www 
[16:53:05] dawagner: Chrome invalidates its cache if it gets in a 301 loop
[16:53:10] dawagner: But firefox and IE don't
[16:53:18] simonstewart: How long is that cache kept for?
[16:53:22] dawagner: Ever.
[16:53:24] dawagner: Well
[16:53:26] simonstewart: Surely only up to the TTL of the name
[16:53:38] dawagner: Until the user forcibly flushes the cache, or the browser runs out of its own storage
[16:53:41] dawagner: 301 is permanent
[16:53:42] simonstewart: Which is currently 500 seconds
[16:53:49] dawagner: It's not DNS, it's HTTP
[16:53:49] simonstewart: Well, that's lame
[16:53:51] dawagner: Yep
[16:53:52] simonstewart: Yeah
[16:53:56] dawagner: It's a fairly well known problem :(

[16:54:34] simonstewart: Yeah
[16:54:43] simonstewart: At some point, we should go back to www
[16:54:58] dawagner: There's no clean way to do so :(

[17:04:09] lukeis: yeah
[17:04:26] lukeis: can we 302 though?
[17:04:27] lukeis: :)
[17:04:57] dawagner: Yes, though that will hurt our SEO
[17:05:08] dawagner: The standard solution seems to be 302 for users, 301 for robots
[17:05:09] lukeis: i knowâ€¦ but it's worth the hurt
[17:06:24] lukeis: can you constrain on user agent though?
[17:07:07] dawagner: Yep

[19:39:28] lukeis: By.tagName("input") /me shakes head at the xpath usage
[19:40:03] regex: RossPatterson: Maybe the sibling then?  The sibling element.
[19:40:52] lukeis: regex: in your link can you describe the thing you want? like "Male" or the second radio input or something else?
[19:41:09] RossPatterson: Yeah, what Lukey said.

[19:42:51] RossPatterson: jleyba: By.xpath(".//input").  One of my pet peeves with WD is that XPath is interpreted in the context of the *document*, not the *element* like all other sub-selections.  Issue #403 was a bad call.

[19:43:59] jleyba: RossPatterson: my search was driven from the driver object, so the context would be document. In this case, "//input" is correct

[19:45:53] RossPatterson: jimevans: XPath doesn't say that "//" means "anywhere in the document".  XPath understands contexts very well, and element.findElement(By.xpath("//input")) ought to specify the context to be the base-element.
[19:46:24] RossPatterson: But I understand that XPath makes lots of pandas sad :-)

[19:48:41] RossPatterson: regex: That's pretty easy: //input[@value='female']

[20:02:15] lukeis: regex: you might find if you are walking the dom to find elements in any way your tests will be brittleâ€¦ locating each and every one by id / class / unique attribute will be longer lasting
[20:02:54] Applejuice: RossPatterson: Sorry was workin on my tests. The problem with Knockout.js is that is passes data into innerHTML elements after a page has been fully loaded. I can't figure out a way to make Selenium essentially "wait" untill Knockout.js has finished putting all of the data on the page before running.

[20:48:04] avillanueva-npr: So the reason I want it to do the ajaxWait (wait for the response to be 0 from jQuery) is so that it has time for the autocomplete to go away before going to the next row. Perhaps I should be waiting on the initial autocomplete DOM element to be removed? Don't know how to check for that though.
[20:48:46] lukeis: if there's a dom element being removed, use ExpectedConditions.invisibilityOf
