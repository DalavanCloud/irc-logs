[00:31:25] sahazel: why are those notices?
[00:31:34] sahazel: super annoying in my IRC client
[00:31:54] santiycr: that's the Selenium CI build being aborted
[00:32:15] santiycr: I'm tuning where the jar is being pulled for the Selenium CI
[00:32:21] sahazel: maybe irccloud is weird in this respect, but it thinks I always want to see NOTICE messages no matter which channel I'm looking at
[00:50:24] santiycr: NOTICE: your irc client is dumb
[00:57:14] santiycr: get ready for notice storm, sorry, can't disable irc plugin with my permissions

[07:17:43] hadean: ohai. i got my html ide tests to run within eclipse running as JUnit4 tests. But can somebody tell me why he converts:
[07:17:43] hadean: assertAttribute
[07:17:43] hadean: css=.module-pagination-control-next@href
[07:17:43] hadean: /newsarchiv?currdate=11.2012

[07:17:43] hadean: a) why does he convert a ? within a string into [\\s\\S] and b) why does the regex miss his terminators?
[07:18:02] hadean: dafuq? Oo okay my client is messed up it seems

[11:14:19] dawagner: (If I can get google code to let me authenticate :))
[11:14:53] santiycr: on the plus side, we now have a decent dashboard from the Sauce side:
[11:14:54] santiycr: https://saucelabs.com/u/selenium-ci
[11:15:01] dawagner: Woo! :D
[11:15:44] santiycr: once we report pass/fail status, using https://github.com/saucelabs/saucerest-java, the dashboard will be all full of useful greens and red
[11:16:03] dawagner: Cool :D
[11:16:16] dawagner: Will it deal with our multiple-sessions-per-test thing?
[11:16:27] santiycr: oh, forgot about that part!
[11:16:38] santiycr: that will be tricky to address
[11:17:01] dawagner: But I'm sure we can do so!
[11:17:09] santiycr: I guess we can report an overall, all passed vs one failed
[11:17:25] dawagner: Maybe you could introduce a group-by tag or something?
[11:17:25] santiycr: or alternatively, break all tests into separate sessions
[11:17:36] santiycr: now that jar downloads are fast, it may be reasonable 
[11:17:49] dawagner: Though we have two levels of grouping; "this commit" and "this commit this browser"
[11:18:21] santiycr: isn't "this commit" directly connect to the build number?
[11:18:36] santiycr: actually, build # being more specific, in cases where we re-run tests for the same commit
[11:18:51] dawagner: I didn't think we reported the build number
[11:19:09] santiycr: we now do :)
[11:19:13] dawagner: Woo!
[11:19:21] santiycr: I'm reporting a unified build #
[11:19:30] santiycr: passed down the jenkins jobs from Build All Java
[11:19:39] dawagner: Awesome!
[11:20:13] santiycr: with build # and pass/fail reports, the sauce dashboard may be an awesome addition to our set of tools
[11:20:46] santiycr: we can even get a nice badge to put somewhere :)
[11:22:12] santiycr: then we can add that to :ci

[11:23:32] santiycr: we're working hard to make it useful 
[11:23:37] dawagner: I'm very jealous of it, it's much better than what we have :(
[11:24:15] santiycr: you mean we as in "Selenium"?
[11:24:30] santiycr: cuz if so, we do have it :)
[11:26:44] santiycr: oh, one last thing I did was to ‚Äîexclude=.git from the tarball made by Build All Java. Noticed that part + its later downloads take a big chunk of the build time
[11:27:03] santiycr: we were excluding .svn and didn't move to .git once the repo changed
[11:27:58] *santiycr getting ready for bed while the build starts and confirms my code works
[11:34:31] dawagner: santiycr: I meant we as in Google

[11:34:55] santiycr: oh, I see

[11:37:56] dawagner: A beautiful thing, for sure
[11:38:13] santiycr: alright, now I can definitely go to bed happy :)
[11:38:31] santiycr: we gotta figure out a better way to pass the repo around to the slaves, that seems to be the next bottleneck 
[11:39:00] santiycr: we can't stop until we get to 10min builds total
[11:39:04] dawagner: :D
[11:39:28] santiycr: pushing and getting results in 10min or less == dev nirvana
