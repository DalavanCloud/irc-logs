[11:04:35] barancev: I'm on dev channel, no success, you must be right
[11:10:47] millenium: can I ask a fast question << wait.Until(ExpectedConditions.ElementIsVisible(By.CssSelector("#FirstName,#LastName"))) >> will wait bout of the elements with this Id to be viable, right?
[11:14:13] AutomatedTester: millenium: will wait for there to be at least 1 element with that ID
[11:14:27] AutomatedTester: the good thing about IDs is that you can only have 1 for it to be valid HTML
[11:19:49] millenium: AutomatedTester: but with CssSelector I select two elements, and the idea of Ids is to be unique - my idea is to check all input's are they viable with one line of code and good css selector
[11:20:14] millenium: I couldn't find in internet enough info about it 
[11:27:25] Ardesco: use two waits
[11:27:32] Ardesco: what you are doing seems like a good idea now
[11:27:46] Ardesco: but when it fails you won't know which element caused the failure
[11:28:16] Ardesco: always write your tests so it's easy to what caused failures

[15:38:22] mario-goulart: Hi.  I have some scheme bindings for the json wire protocols that used to work with version 2.0b3.  I have upgraded the firefox webdriver to version 2.29 and noticed that /session/:sessionId/element/:id/selected doesn't work anymore for POST.  What's the recommended method got selecting an element?
[15:38:43] jimevans: mario-goulart: use click.
[15:39:12] mario-goulart: jimevans: thanks.
[15:40:11] jimevans: mario-goulart: are you the maintainer of the scheme bindings? if not, the maintainer needs to do a better job of keeping up with changes in the protocol. 2.0b3 is a very, very long time ago.
[15:40:15] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[15:41:05] mario-goulart: jimevans: yeah, I'm the maintainer.  And, indeed, last time I worked on it was a long time ago.

[16:36:45] mario-goulart: dawagner: do you use scheme or you are just making fun of me? :-)
[16:37:06] jimevans: barancev: probably, but i don't think jleyba's completely done with his changes there yet.

[16:39:27] barancev: can "modifiers" be completely done sometimes, ever? :)

[16:43:06] farlan: does anyone know if it is possible to download the source for Google's chromedriver?
[16:44:19] jimevans: farlan: the source code is part of the chromium project. you can get it from their repository. however, it has dependencies on the chromium project itself, so you probably can't get "just" the chromedriver code without having some parts of the chromium tree too.
[16:45:15] dawagner: https://src.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/test/webdriver is the svn path to check out for the code

[16:46:00] Ardesco: detronizator: how does phantoms handle hover events
[16:46:18] Ardesco: should it leave the mouse at the last place a hoverover was triggered
[16:46:45] Ardesco: i'm having some issues with our hover event tests and i'm not seeing things appear when a mouseover event is triggered
[16:46:51] jimevans: Ardesco: depends on what the injectable atoms do.
[16:46:56] Ardesco: hard to debug a headless thing :)
[16:47:07] Ardesco: works fine in all drivers apart from ghostdriver
[16:47:07] detronizator: Ardesco: it "should" but I think that part is flaky
[16:47:16] Ardesco: so i'm thinking it;'s a phantoms specific thing
[16:47:26] detronizator: bloody mouse events in QtWebKit are killing us
[16:47:41] detronizator: Ardesco: it might

[16:48:29] Ardesco: (well not in that specific part anyway)

[16:50:28] jimevans: :note jleyba do the injectible atoms handle the "NULL" key properly? in other words, do they properly release all modifier keys when that keystroke is encountered? if so, we should discuss your recent modifier key persistence changes.

[IRC logfile - Started Mon Jan 28 18:01:27 2013]
[18:01:27] jimevans: jleyba: good then. so the IE driver literally appends the NULL key to the sequence for element.sendKeys. the auto_release_modifier_keys parameter to InputManager::SendKeystrokes() really doesn't matter.

[19:19:05] cyberlogi_: barancev: I don't, I was just confused, because I'm not finding the plugin I'm looking for. There used to be a FireFox extension that recorded your actions and outputted it in whatever language you wanted... does that still exist? I don't see it in the list of plugins
[19:19:32] RossPatterson: cyberlogi_: You're confused.
[19:19:45] RossPatterson: There's "Selenium IDE", which is a Firefox plugin.
[19:19:54] RossPatterson: And then there are Selenium IDE plugins.
[19:20:14] barancev: cyberlogi_: then, you should do to the top of the download page, find the Selenium IDE section, "Download latest released version 1.10.0 released on 20/December/2012"

[19:33:18] RossPatterson: Here's the test: put a 30 second pause in, if it succeeds, replace it with a WebDriverWait(...) that waits for the element to be visible.  If it fails, it's a different problem.

[19:40:36] lukeis: plightbo_work have a chance to look at the redirects for seleniumhq.org?
[19:41:01] barancev: phew, all these sites are messed up...
[19:43:16] RossPatterson: Phasze: There are some known problems with element visibility in Firefox since (I think) 2.28.  If I recall, the it's a case involving CSS Transforms and mistaking visible elements for not visible.  But I don't know the real details.
[19:43:39] lukeis: that's a really edge case
[19:47:03] Phasze: barancev: http://imgur.com/OGVyQt1 is the image of the drop down menu that becomes visible, and here is the source for after you click the element above to make it visible https://gist.github.com/4658424
[19:47:56] Phasze: RossPatterson: I've tried with both IEDriverServer and firefox webdriver and get the same results (though both are 2.28.0+)

[19:48:38] Phasze: kk
[19:49:08] santiycr: dawagner:  wanted to ask if you've noticed any new issues coming up in our build now that we're on temp storage
[19:50:34] barancev: dawagner: why did we moved from resources to embedded?
[19:53:47] RossPatterson: Oh, THAT'S the problem.  You don't have a drop-down, you have some silly JavaScript framework pseudo-drop-down.  Odds are good you're not clicking on the element it expects you to click on.
[19:54:01] Phasze: barancev: would you be willing to look at it if I gave you access to the site?
[19:54:56] Phasze: yup RossPatterson, the dropdown blows monkey balls, but I unfortunately have no control over it :(
[19:55:49] barancev: Phasze: not right now, I'm busy debugging another issue, can't stop it :)

[20:34:16] jimevans: regex__: and *this* is why i don't use chained dot references for something like this. you have AutomationFramework.Application.Selenium.Model.Object.LoginPage.UserName(), and any one of the  things after a dot (.) could be throwing the exception. 
[20:35:14] RossPatterson: Ah. The efFluent pattern :-)
[20:35:39] qaguy has joined #selenium
[20:36:09] jimevans: RossPatterson: except in this case, it makes no attempt to "read like english"
[20:37:05] regex__: jimevans: I'll make a reference and isolate.  I know that it's the textfield object reference.  Why can't it also use the IWebElement? 
[20:40:35] regex__: jimevans: http://picpaste.com/error-E5C0v2CW.png
[20:42:41] jimevans: regex__: you've never set the "driver" variable. do yourself a favor, and add "using" clauses for your namespaces. you're using the fully-qualified namespace path to the LoginPage class, but you're once again confusing static and instance methods.
[20:44:12] jimevans: simply declaring "protected readonly new static IWebDriver driver;" in the LoginPage class doesn't mean you've ever actually *set* it to anything (which you haven't).
[20:49:02] regex__: jimevans: Thank you.  Good, good.  Thinking
[20:49:32] jimevans: regex__: i still don't understand what your obsession with static methods is.

[20:51:03] jimevans: regex__: how so? i don't grant that premise in the slightest.
[20:52:30] regex__: jimevans: Then when I'm calling the page objects, I can simply use dot notation instead of using a 'NEW' keyword all over the place.
[20:52:56] regex__: jimevans: Hopefully you can help me fix this.  I want this to run and the page objects to not have the reference error...
[20:54:24] jimevans: regex__: you realize that this architecture is going against more than 50 years of "best practice" in object oriented programming, right?

[20:57:03] jimevans: regex__: that's my intent. you're going down a path that i can almost guarantee will cause you maintenance problems in the future.
[20:58:09] regex__: jimevans: I'll stop using static...
[20:58:14] jimevans: if you can help me understand what you have against the "new" operator, i might be able to help
[20:59:04] jimevans: if you're trying to have a single entry point for people to code from, you can use a factory to create the strongly-typed page objects you need.

[21:01:04] regex__: jimevans: Yes.  A factory. 
[21:01:56] regex__: jimevans: I am fine iwth the new operator.  As long as I can call each individual object in the future.  
[21:02:03] regex__: jimevans: wasted memory for one
[21:03:12] jimevans: regex__: but it doesn't waste memory.
[21:03:47] regex__: jimevans: So you're saying a factory pattern like: http://www.dotnetperls.com/factory
[21:05:51] jcarr has joined #selenium
[21:06:30] jimevans: regex__: yeah, but the challenge with traditional factories like that is that you're going to have a class with fairly high cyclomatic complexity, in that it's going to be highly coupled to all of the classes that you'll create. you can use reflection to reduce the coupling, but that's opens up other potential issues.

[21:16:47] jimevans: regex__: not really. you need a way to pass your driver instance to the LoginPage class so that it is able to use the FindElement() method to find the user name text field.

[21:35:29] jimevans: regex__: it's a property. .NET syntactic sugar. you could just as easily make it a method, but i'm a firm believer that method names should be verbs.
[21:36:37] jimevans: (and if  you're going to create a "GetUserName" method, you might as well use java at that point).

[22:19:29] regex__: jimevans: LINE 34 bottom:  https://gist.github.com/4659745
[22:21:30] jimevans: sigh. one more time. the UserName property in what i posted is an *instance* property. you can't just attempt to use it directly off the LoginPage type. you need an instance (created with "new") to be able to get at that property. you can't just pick and choose the pieces of the classes i posted. they only work as a whole unit.
[22:22:21] jimevans: that's why i gave you the "MyApp" class, to give you that entry point into the application whereby you can call "LoginPage" using the . notation. although, hang on a second.
[22:23:23] sayd: anyone know about this https://github.com/sebuilder/se-builder/issues/18
[22:23:34] jimevans: i've made a mistake with naming property names the same name as class names. that's legal, and even advisable in some cases, but as you're having a great deal of trouble separating static properties and methods from instance properties and methods, that's probably going to confuse you.

[23:51:22] elstif: Hi! Is there any other tool to automate tests in mobile sites (like selenium 2, to tests safari mobile)?
[23:52:07] dude-x: sayd, sleep 10 sleeps for a full 10 seconds (which is more than 10 real time seconds due to the CPU not paying attention to Python at times)
[23:53:10] dude-x: sayd: the webdriverwait class will try for 10 seconds, to satisfy a condition. If it fails to do so in 10 seconds then it gives up by throwing an exception. otherwise it won't waste your time with a full 10 seconds
