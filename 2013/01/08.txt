[08:35:47] aero1: I'm having trouble running selenium whereas I was running it on a very near identical set up last night
[08:36:28] aero1: I run Arch on all machines - installed python2-selenium from the AUR as well as the selenium-standalone-server and started it with systemd
[08:36:50] aero1: when I run the WebDriver, my browser opens but it doesn't actually "do" anything.
[08:36:59] zeljkof has joined #selenium

[09:47:21] krosenvold_: Technically; it does not have to be written in java, but it has to access java logic that provides test data

[11:26:30] AutomatedTester: and setting up for a wake
[11:29:53] krosenvold_: simonstewart: Hi !
[11:30:05] krosenvold_: I heard my name being mentioned ... ?
[11:30:40] *krosenvold_ has a most excellent tan after 3 weeks under a coconut tree
[11:31:02] krosenvold_: In other words, less pale than usual
[11:31:14] AutomatedTester: he lives!
[11:32:22] krosenvold_: LIke simonstewart I have somewhat changed project. So I no longer have the world's largest suite of selenium tests to babysit. 
[11:32:55] krosenvold_: My current project has 2 tests ;)
[11:33:07] AutomatedTester: krosenvold_: new company or new project?
[11:33:11] freynaud: krosenvold_: woot.
[11:33:13] krosenvold_: new project
[11:33:40] krosenvold_: The project only has 2 selenium tests, that is ;)
[11:34:28] davehunt: krosenvold_: who's babysitting the world's largest suite of selenium tests now? :)
[11:34:32] AutomatedTester: krosenvold_: you must be itching to make more tests then?
[11:35:35] krosenvold_: AutomatedTester: Quite frankly, I needed a tiny break ;)
[11:35:49] krosenvold_: I think 200 indian devs have been allocated to do my job
[11:35:54] krosenvold_: Much cheaper that way
[11:36:50] krosenvold_: I'd been on that project for 5 years, so moving on was way opverdue
[11:37:12] davehunt: :)
[11:37:15] Phil__: lol
[11:37:30] dawagner: simonstewart: Is the change you're hoping to land to grid the same change I was about to make?
[11:38:59] simonstewart: krosenvold_: glad you're back. Glad you don't have to maintain a vast number of tests now
[11:39:03] simonstewart: 2 seems the other extreme
[11:39:09] simonstewart: dawagner: no. A different one
[11:40:12] simonstewart: That breaks things. Arse
[11:40:18] dawagner: Ok, I'll do the thing I'm doing then :)
[11:42:33] simonstewart: On the plus side, CrazyFunJava can now build Core sufficiently well that RC can start firefox
[11:42:39] simonstewart: This, my friends, is progress
[11:42:54] simonstewart: Sadly, the changes to the build files cause CrazyFunRuby to go AWOL
[11:43:04] simonstewart: This, my friends, is not progress
[11:43:48] simonstewart: krosenvold_: I'm kind of keen to finish that whole "do the git work" thing
[11:43:54] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[11:44:11] simonstewart: And by "keen" I mean "not keen at all, but I understand that it's something that will make other people happy, and I always like it when other people are happy"
[11:45:53] aero1: hi all - I have python2-selenium working on my home pc but on my work pc it simply fires up the browser but never makes any requests. The installations are the same as far as I can tell.
[11:45:55] aero1: any ideas?
[11:46:05] krosenvold_: simonstewart: lol
[11:46:17] simonstewart: :)
[11:46:47] krosenvold_: I will try the graft ;)
[11:47:09] simonstewart: Many thanks.
[11:47:12] krosenvold_: the git equivalent of a face transplant
[11:47:17] simonstewart: Are the Magic Scripts available anywhere?
[11:47:23] krosenvold_: On my laptop ;)
[11:47:28] simonstewart: Ha! I thought so
[11:47:37] krosenvold_: Of course, my laptop will soon become a retina laptop
[11:47:52] simonstewart: They are jolly nice. Have one now
[11:48:18] krosenvold_: macrumours says there are new models just around the corner
[11:48:33] krosenvold_: So I will have to wait approx 30 days
[11:48:47] simonstewart: Ohhhâ€¦
[11:49:10] krosenvold_: There also seem to be rumours of carbon cases
[11:50:00] dawagner: http://selenium-grid.seleniumhq.org/ << we should probably kill
[11:50:02] samphippen has joined #selenium

[11:50:20] krosenvold_: I probably need one to do the graft ;)
[11:50:33] AutomatedTester: krosenvold_: probably
[11:50:43] AutomatedTester: krosenvold_: the retina display makes things run faster
[11:50:47] simonstewart: Well, if there's a new shell you should wait a bit until the bugs have been ironed out of it
[11:50:48] AutomatedTester: well on mine it does
[11:50:53] krosenvold_: I'm thinking of the 13"
[11:52:21] krosenvold_: But want 4 cores
[11:53:05] simonstewart: Agreed
[11:53:08] simonstewart: 4 cores is good

[12:04:51] AutomatedTester: my commute sucks
[12:04:56] AutomatedTester: especially in snow
[12:04:59] megha has joined #selenium
[12:05:08] AutomatedTester: the snow means I stop and look at it and then go to my office
[12:05:34] *Ardesco now has a office thats full of boxes and loose wires \o/
[12:05:40] Ardesco: and rising damp
[12:06:04] Ardesco: but i can lock the world out, which is a good start
[12:06:04] AutomatedTester: rising damp?
[12:06:04] Ardesco: :)
[12:06:12] AutomatedTester: thats never good
[12:06:12] Ardesco: house we bought has some damp issues
[12:06:19] Ardesco: we knew about it in advance
[12:06:23] davehunt: AutomatedTester: I suspect if the snow was /really/ bad, you could always work from bed ;)
[12:06:35] Ardesco: a damp course is also a lot cheaper than I thought it would be which is a plus
[12:06:40] AutomatedTester: davehunt: if snow is that bad I might not work
[12:06:46] davehunt: snow day!
[12:06:56] Ardesco: unfortunately plastering is a lot more expensive than I thought it would be
[12:07:00] Ardesco: swings and roundabouts
[12:07:19] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: damp course is cheap but to put it in properly is a PITA when there is already a house
[12:07:42] Ardesco: yeah it's the ripping all the plaster off and re-plastering thats a pain
[12:07:50] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: and you need to check what the cause is... if its a bridged cavity then you are going to spend LOTS of money
[12:07:52] Ardesco: but we need to get the electrics redone anyway
[12:07:56] Ardesco: so was going to happen
[12:08:08] Ardesco: already has the damp specialist in
[12:08:20] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: bridged cavity means taking 1/2 the wall away and then rebuilding
[12:08:40] Ardesco: cowboys who rendered the front of the house did it down to ground level 
[12:08:55] Ardesco: so damp can go up render and around
[12:09:11] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: that should only mean problems on the outside
[12:09:17] Ardesco: house is also backing into a hill so first floor is ground level at the back
[12:09:40] Ardesco: according to damp specialist its holding up surprisingly well
[12:09:54] AutomatedTester: sounds it...
[12:10:17] Ardesco: we don't need to do the whole house right now, but may as well get it all done
[12:10:27] jimevans has joined #selenium
[12:11:13] Ardesco: it's about 300 years old so it could probably do with some modern anti damp tech added :)
[12:11:46] Ardesco: on the plus side
[12:12:10] Ardesco: all plaster eventually coming off means I can network the entire house and have cat 6 running through all the walls

[14:27:32] simonstewart: I had to abandon the idea after someone got angry at me in a pub
[14:27:33] jimevans: right. but y'know, requires focus.
[14:27:44] simonstewart: Which is why they got angry
[14:28:46] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: did you buy them a beer and say it will be alright?
[14:28:53] simonstewart: I did.
[14:28:55] simonstewart: And then I fixed it

[15:25:52] Phil___: stale element exceptions + DOM attachment errors are because of pages not being loaded + focus being lost from the window right?
[15:26:43] lukeis: Phil___: not typically, usually the DOM reference was deleted by JS or the page was reloaded since the last lookup of the element
[15:27:07] Phil___: kk, thanks
[15:27:17] AutomatedTester: Phil___: staleelement is we have an ID of a DOM node that the DOM doesnt have anymore
[15:27:33] Phil___: ah i see

[15:36:08] jenkinsselenium: it throws "selenium session could not start " - what might solve the issue - Any help ?
[15:37:26] AutomatedTester: jenkinsselenium: does your jenkins instance have a display?
[15:37:57] jenkinsselenium: script runs in a headless mode
[15:38:32] AutomatedTester: and you have told webdriver to use the headless mode?
[15:38:48] jenkinsselenium: we use Selenium RC and not wedDriver
[15:39:13] AutomatedTester: ok, so you tell RC, when starting up, to use that?
[15:39:16] jenkinsselenium: it doesnt have a display I guess.
[15:40:42] jenkinsselenium: you mean to say when I initialize ?
[15:41:05] Ardesco: no display + browser is generally not a good combination
[15:41:06] jenkinsselenium: if yes, then yeah Default Selenium is initialized.
[15:41:40] AutomatedTester: jenkinsselenium: when starting the jar you need to set the environment variable to say what display
[15:42:15] Ardesco: in the job configuration there should be an option that looks like:
[15:42:16] Ardesco: Start Xvfb before the build, and shut it down after.
[15:42:26] Ardesco: check that
[15:42:26] jenkinsselenium: sorry can pls elaborate on the display ?  might be a silly question - No display in the sense you mean we can see virtually the scripts execution
[15:43:01] Ardesco: that option should be under build environemnt
[15:43:13] Ardesco: if there is no display for the browser to attach to it won't

[17:35:40] nirvdrum: adamgoucher: Yeah.  But it's like arguing that having a web server is complicating things.
[17:35:51] RossPatterson: Might just manage that.  Boston's not that far from DC-metro.

[19:44:27] selenium908: Is it possible to instruct Selenium to pause while a form is submitted on a page? I'm trying to automate on pages with captchas with two methods and both are not that great time wise.
[19:44:47] selenium908:  1) I'm waiting till the char count in input field matches captcha length. But this breaks on with captchas like reCAPTCHA
[19:45:01] regex: thread.sleep(5000); 
[19:45:24] selenium908: 2) Giving it a time to pause for like 10 secs, but this is not great as sometimes it's too short
[19:46:25] regex: You could put the first method in a while loop that waits until the last character of the string is typed. 
[19:47:44] regex: string type = "captcha", int length = 7.  While(type.length > 7) { thread.sleep(5000) }; 
[19:47:52] regex: * < 7 
[19:47:54] selenium908: I have that in place right now. But it's little problematic with reCAPTCHA as it's two words of different lengths
[19:48:30] regex: Put the first captcha type variable into an array.  
[19:48:37] AutomatedTester: selenium908: dont automate captcha
[19:48:43] selenium908: I gave it a length limit of 30 and I'm having to fill the rest with spaces
[19:49:17] selenium908: AutomatedTester: I'm not autmating it, just want Selenium to wait until I submit the form
[19:49:47] AutomatedTester: selenium908: make it wait how you would do any other form of synchronisation
[19:49:51] regex: You put put a while until the final captcha button is clicked. 
[19:50:04] selenium908: Aha!
[19:50:08] AutomatedTester: using sleep in a test as a method of waiting is very bad practise
[19:50:11] selenium908: That makes sense
[19:50:43] lukeis: if you're doing python i would probably do a 'raw_input' command
[19:50:47] regex: while(captchaBtn !+ captchaBtn.clicked()) or something. 
[19:50:58] regex: * != 
[19:51:11] selenium908: WebDriverWait(browser, 300).until(lambda x: len(x.find_element_by_name('recaptcha_response_field').get_attribute('value')) == 25)
[19:51:15] selenium908: I had this now ^
[19:51:26] AutomatedTester: lol at recruiter. "Works with all the latest technologies like FitNesse"
[19:52:04] regex: The lengtch could be different depending on latency and inability for interaction with other elements.  The only solid behavior you have is if that button is clicked or not.
[19:52:05] lukeis: selenium908: why don't you just wait for the stalenessOf the captcha field and make your 'manual' process be submitting the form
[19:52:41] lukeis: ExpectedConditions.staleness_of ;)

[20:22:45] selenium908: Man, Selenium is great. I had gotten an internship at this marketing group with "helping creating webpages" but it turned out to be posting real-estate ads on websites. What used to take me 6-7hrs/day is now done under 40mins.
[20:32:45] RossPatterson: Congrats!  Now your challenge is to find a way to make yourself useful to them for 5-6 hours a day.  Consider putting some of that time into making the Selenium process as bullet-proof as you reasonably can, so they'll still be able to use it when your internship is over.  And welcome to the profession!

[20:45:44] chrelad: Hi everyone, does anyone know if there is a Selenium (using Grid and WebDriver C#/nunit tests) issue that might cause an element not to be found in the DOM (by ID) even if someone's confirmed that the element does actually exist in the DOM while the test is running? The element in questions is created by JavaScript after the page loads. We are experiencing the issue on a virtual machine, but not on the developer's local computer.
[20:45:57] llaskin: :gist us an example
[20:45:59] selbot2_: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[20:46:43] selenium908: RossPatterson: nice, which hs did you attend?
[20:46:43] RossPatterson: chrelad: It's almost certain that the element isn't there at the time WebDriver is searching for it.
[20:47:04] chrelad: Okay, we are using explicit waits (wait.until) and we are still not seeing it.
[20:47:11] RossPatterson: selenium908: Stuyvesant, in those days at 15th & 1st.  It moved down to Chambers long afterward.
[20:47:40] chrelad: RossPatterson: We've also tried implicit waits, for loops that catch the byid exception and retry five times with a wait in the catch, etc.
[20:47:48] llaskin: chrelad: again, we need a gist of your code.
[20:47:58] RossPatterson: chrelad: In that case, you probably ought to post your HTML and code as llaskin suggests.

[23:22:28] regex: Yes.  Exactly.  But is there any parameter I can put in the instance of radiobutton for it to work?  I am wrapping in the object repository naturally.
[23:23:06] jimevans: yes. the parameter you want is an IWebElement, which is the result of a FindElement() call.

[23:24:38] jimevans: you haven't shown me anywhere that you find the initial radio button. there are several methods in your RadioButton class that return IWebElement siblings or descendants or ancestors, but you haven't shown me where you find the initial radio button you'd use to initialize this object.
[23:26:57] regex: jimevans: Cool.  Yeah.  You always have the answer immediately.  I'll show you what I did to fix this instance. 
[23:27:24] regex: jimevans: https://gist.github.com/4489075
[23:27:47] jimevans: regex: and that's exactly how it should be done. :)
[23:28:23] regex: jimevans: However ideally this is how I'm wrapping all those objects: https://gist.github.com/4489079
[23:28:54] regex: jimevans: So that all the test objects are in ONE place isntead of spread throughout scripts. 
[23:29:25] jimevans: that's fine, as far as it goes. i'm not sure i'd do it that way, but if that works for you, godspeed.
[23:29:57] regex: Why wouldn't you do it that way?  
[23:31:25] jimevans: i'd more likely use a page object pattern, wherein the locators for the specific page are within that page's class. very localized. much easier to maintain. your approach is going to rapidly approach a big, huge god-object.

[23:31:56] regex: But the same objects can be spread across multiple pages. 
[23:32:27] SupplyCrawler: Oy. Running the same webdriver script on two different machines. Both appear to get cookies, but only one uses them, the other doesn't
[23:32:33] jimevans: then use "component" objects.
[23:32:36] regex: So if the repository class only held page objects for a specific page.  Exactly how I have it currently coded?
[23:32:44] SupplyCrawler: anyone have experience with having to adjust permissions or something for Chrome? Or any other reason why this is happening? :(
[23:33:11] jimevans: regex: pretty close. i'd probably not be using static methods as often as I see in your code either.
[23:33:27] regex: I've removed most of the static calls.  
[23:33:43] regex: jimevans: I'm taking your advice and trying to adjust.  
[23:34:12] jimevans: well, i'm not the end-all, be-all authority on this stuff, i just know what's worked for me.
[23:34:39] regex: jimevans: Don't lie to yourself.  You know you are the authority.  
[23:34:56] AeroNotix: .....
[23:34:59] jimevans: new, i'm just this guy, you know?

[23:40:56] AeroNotix: that was the most awkward conversation I've ever read on IRC.
[23:41:46] jimevans: AeroNotix: you've not been reading conversations on IRC long, then? that's not even terribly awkward for this channel! :)
[23:42:07] AeroNotix: jimevans: maybe not, it seems pretty tight-knit around here (not a bad thing)
[23:42:27] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[23:42:28] jimevans: and i never thought i'd have to explain a zaphod beeblebrox reference in a group of developers. :)
[23:42:50] AeroNotix: I'm.....not American
[23:43:22] jimevans: neither would a reference to zaphod beeblebrox be. hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. douglas adams.
[23:43:34] regex: jimevans: Let's say I have a class without a main method that provides a smoke test implementation for one page.  I want to run it in C# from a main method if I call the class.  What can I do to call Login.Start() from a main method?  
[23:44:00] AeroNotix: anyway, bedtime
[23:44:21] regex: .Run?  .Start?  I haven't found the right windows utility using namespace either...
[23:44:48] jimevans: regex: assuming the Login class can be instantiated (that is, has a public constructor), create the Login class, and call the right method to do what you want.
[23:45:17] jimevans: or i may be getting my classes confused with what you're asking.
[23:45:39] regex: Yes.  I don't have that "right method".  It's like .Start or .Run from a windows utility.  But it's not working....
[23:45:58] regex: Curious if you ever segment test runs into classes. 
[23:46:35] jimevans: i group like *tests* together in classes. I depend on my test runner framework to allow me to group them into meaningful suites.
[23:47:14] jimevans: usually with an attribute on the test method.
[23:47:41] jimevans: NUnit has a Category attribute, which would let me assign the test method to one or more categories. MbUnit should have a similar one.
[23:48:48] regex: Interesting.  I just wish I had that one method to instantiate that class.  Maybe I don't need it. 
[23:49:41] jimevans: so create an instance of the class, then, and just call the method.
[23:51:32] SupplyCrawler: Uh
[23:51:36] SupplyCrawler: Hmm...
[23:51:49] SupplyCrawler: Is there anyway I can pre-load a chrome user profile with cookies and stuff onto chromedriver?
[23:52:14] regex: LoginPageTest _login = new loginPageTest(); and than just be like _login() in the maind method without like _login.Run(); ? 
[23:53:21] jimevans: https://gist.github.com/4489233
[23:53:57] jimevans: regex: ^^
[23:55:21] regex: Beautiful.  So that [Test] fixture is callable. 
[23:55:23] jimevans: it wouldn't be just _login(). _login has an instance of your class, and you need to call the method containing your code in it.
[23:55:54] regex: Jim, you're the best.  You solve every problem immediately.  You need to try Jeopardy. 
[23:56:18] jimevans: all [Test] fixtures are callable. they're just "plain old C# code". the only thing special about it is the metadata indicated by the [Test] attribute, and that's only used by the test runner.
[23:58:02] jimevans: however, that's kinda the long way around it. most unit test frameworks in the .NET space have a GUI test runner. they usually represent all of the test methods in a .dll in some way, usually as a tree. running a single method is often just as simple as right-clicking on the node in the tree and saying "run"
