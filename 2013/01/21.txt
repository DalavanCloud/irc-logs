[11:36:07] eutheria: i wasn't sure what the topic meant
[11:36:28] simonstewart: 2.29 was our first release using "git" as our source control system
[11:36:40] simonstewart: It was also the first release with native events support for Firefox 18
[11:36:41] eutheria: ah
[11:36:55] eutheria: i thought it meant for ff18 you need to get the version from git
[11:37:07] eutheria: oh the wiki page has not been updated
[11:37:13] simonstewart: absolutely not
[11:37:19] simonstewart: Which one?
[11:37:30] eutheria: sorry downloads page, http://seleniumhq.org/download/
[11:37:37] simonstewart: Long story about that
[11:37:46] Phil37: that's a legacy site
[11:37:48] simonstewart: Short version: "we're working on fixing it"
[11:37:56] eutheria: no problem
[11:37:57] simonstewart: And that URL will one day point to the right place
[11:37:57] tms_: eutheria: sorry for that. Actually I am trying to select multiple elements with control key. Which is not running on win but running fine on Linux.  
[11:38:55] eutheria: everyone seems to be moving off google code and over to github
[11:39:07] tms_: So I am getting error : InvalidElementStateException: Cannot perform native interaction: Could not load native events component.
[11:39:18] eutheria: so where should i download from?
[11:39:32] simonstewart: eutheria: we're still on google

[11:45:00] eutheria: all the drivers etc
[11:45:07] AutomatedTester: eutheria: it is?
[11:45:28] eutheria: you have to get the .jar, the local web drivers for ie etc
[11:46:24] AutomatedTester: unfortunately virus monitors dont like you unpacking an exe from a jar and then running it..,

[13:05:30] Ardesco: but native events will not work in FF18 with 2.27.2
[13:05:49] tms_: Ardesco: but I am able to run my code on Linux 
[13:05:53] tms_: with selenium-webdriver (2.27.2)
[13:06:11] Ardesco: that's because linux doesn't use native events by defauklt
[13:06:29] tms_: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list this is not for webdriver 
[13:06:40] tms_: Ardesco: ah...ok
[13:06:48] Ardesco: and yes it is

[14:10:56] Ardesco: or you have a very lucrative contrac
[14:11:17] Ardesco: Sophos used to make a shit load of money every year supporting NT4
[14:11:30] p_l: Ardesco: NT4 and 9x are two different things, frankly speaking
[14:11:39] p_l: I'd rather support NT4 than ME
[14:11:45] Ardesco: Chrysler had a bunch of NT4 powered machines that couldn't be upgraded and paid a premium
[14:12:06] Ardesco: the point being that if you have a customer stuck with them and willing to shell out loads for support...
[14:12:07] Ardesco: :)
[14:12:37] p_l: Ardesco: yes. But I bet those machines ran stuff like industrial control
[14:12:46] p_l: not things you run on 9x if you value your money
[14:12:50] Ardesco: something to do with production line robots
[14:12:59] p_l: yep, industrial automation
[14:13:07] p_l: something that was sold as a package

[14:18:42] Ardesco: I like what software testing club are doing, but I hate the prices
[14:18:56] Ardesco: £25 a month to join their test ninja's thingy
[14:19:08] Ardesco: I'd rather use an agent tbh

[14:19:21] AutomatedTester: you're welcome
[14:19:46] Ardesco: and £25 a month to add something to their directory?

[14:24:36] AutomatedTester: Hurray! Ubuntu 12.04 upgrade breaks VMWare Fusion
[14:25:15] Ardesco: p_l: I agree
[14:25:29] Ardesco: agents are a royal pain in the arse and I wouldn't trust them as far as I can throw them
[14:25:35] Ardesco: but I get all my work through them
[14:25:43] Ardesco: so they have apoint
[14:25:44] Ardesco: :)
[14:26:07] p_l: Ardesco: I recently met (well, was present at a meeting) with  a guy who described his try at finding a job like he currently does, but at different company
[14:26:10] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: is there not enough work via word of mouth?
[14:26:27] p_l: he had to pay an agency, because unlike him, they could check job listings *worldwide*
[14:26:33] Ardesco: most companies i've worked for want an agency in the middle
[14:26:34] p_l: guess how many were there? :D
[14:26:50] Ardesco: 1
[14:26:51] Ardesco: :)
[14:27:05] Ardesco: it's the new tax rues
[14:27:19] Ardesco: the last company that money went through is liable if tax isn't paid on earnings
[14:27:30] Ardesco: so most companies insist on an agency to pass the liability
[14:27:42] Ardesco: most agencies also insist you have your own LTD to pass liability
[14:28:01] Ardesco: also I wouldn't want to work direct for a big corp like Sky
[14:28:10] Ardesco: have you any idea how hard it is to get them to pay
[14:28:26] Phil37: bskyb
[14:28:33] Ardesco: yup
[14:28:49] p_l: Ardesco: no, 3
[14:28:55] p_l: one of them was in Syria

[14:29:07] p_l: ah, sorry, not Syria... Libya
[14:29:16] Ardesco: nice either way..
[14:29:41] p_l: he was director of flight safety at an airline

[15:15:03] simonstewart: jarib: that url should not have needed rewriting. I thought that dawagner fixed that
[15:30:06] AutomatedTester: that thing where you reaslise you havent written your SeConf proposal yet
[15:31:03] simonstewart: Neither have I
[15:31:11] simonstewart: Still waiting for a blog post to push up on the blog
[15:31:24] simonstewart: (I've been a bit busy, otherwise would have written one myself)
[15:32:25] AutomatedTester: i wrote my GTAC one on Friday while drinking a beer 
[15:32:32] AutomatedTester: nearly finished
[15:32:40] AutomatedTester: just need to find someone to talk with
[15:32:41] simonstewart: GTAC I've already submitted
[15:32:47] *simonstewart waves
[15:33:12] AutomatedTester: from my team
[15:33:21] simonstewart: Well can't help there :)
[15:33:24] AutomatedTester: otherwise I would do it with you :)
[15:33:33] simonstewart: Ta
[15:33:40] AutomatedTester: what's your topic?
[15:34:17] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: ^
[15:34:27] simonstewart: "The Search for Planet X"
[15:34:45] AutomatedTester: ok...
[15:34:47] simonstewart: And possibly something about how Facebook build and test their Android app, provided I can get clearance for it
[15:34:54] AutomatedTester: ok
[15:35:14] AutomatedTester: I am gone for "How would you test an OS? And on Mobile?"
[15:35:20] AutomatedTester: the title needs more work
[15:35:48] simonstewart: Au contraire. If I find someone's napped my talk subject I can change it at a moments notice
[15:35:54] simonstewart: To something about Neptune
[15:36:01] AutomatedTester: my title...

[15:37:57] AutomatedTester: andreastt: submit a talk...
[15:38:07] AutomatedTester: if the NDA police allow it
[15:38:09] simonstewart: nirvdrum: I'm pretty sure that an hour long howl of rage would be appreciated
[15:38:09] jimevans: g'day everybody!
[15:38:12] andreastt: AutomatedTester: They make the computer play stuff with audio.  Which is pretty funny if you head to the server room.

[15:40:41] danielb_: Hi, we noticed that Platform.getCurrent() returns XP on Windows 8.  We were thinking of patching it by reading the windows version from the registry instead of the os.name property. Does that sounds ok ?
[15:40:53] simonstewart: There appears to be a lot of profanity issuing from my direction. Soz everyone
[15:40:56] Phil37: lmao

[15:44:00] simonstewart: Hmmm...
[15:44:16] simonstewart: Platform is part of our core APIs
[15:44:26] simonstewart: Which we mandate have no external dependencies
[15:44:56] simonstewart: So the two obvious way of doing this is to use JNA (out) or our Command class (which relies on guava) so that's out
[15:45:04] simonstewart: What's wrong with extending the current mechanism used?
[15:45:34] danielb_: when I tried I just saw "windows nt (unknown)" from os.name
[15:45:46] jarib: i'm a bit behind schedule, will get the ruby release out later today
[15:45:47] jarib: bbl
[15:45:52] simonstewart: Which Java version?
[15:45:57] dawagner: simonstewart: That URL jari was rewriting is just in our internal tests, not in anything that gets shipped to anyone
[15:46:02] simonstewart: What does "os.version" return?
[15:46:06] simonstewart: ok
[15:46:09] simonstewart: thanks, dawagner 
[15:46:13] *simonstewart relaxes
[15:46:36] andreastt: simonstewart: You could do reflection on java.util.prefs.Preferences.
[15:46:38] danielb_: simonstewart: should be 1.7.0 (did not check os.version yet)
[15:46:39] andreastt: simonstewart: Or shell out.
[15:47:01] simonstewart: That seems less than optimal
[15:47:13] simonstewart: danielb_: ok. Check os.version first. There must be some useful data in there
[15:47:37] danielb_: simonstewart: os.version = 6.2
[15:48:04] simonstewart: Then we're looking for "nt" in os.name and "6.2" in the os.version
[15:48:14] simonstewart: KISS is the watchword
[15:48:15] jimevans: danielb_: if you're going to check windows versions, by far, my preference would be to use the windows api to do so. specifically the GetVersionEx function.
[15:48:27] andreastt: That should be sufficient to check: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Windows_versions
[15:48:27] simonstewart: jimevans: that's hard to reach from pure Java
[15:48:34] andreastt: > 6.2 is Windows 8.
[15:48:38] andreastt: >= actually.
[15:48:43] nirvdrum: jarib: I need to disappear for an hour.  But if you have time later, let's talk about browsermoby-proxy-rb.
[15:48:58] simonstewart: I'd really rather we didn't introduce external deps to core interfaces
[15:49:13] danielb_: right so nt + 6.2 sounds like a plan then
[15:49:19] mates has joined #selenium
[15:49:26] simonstewart: Agreed
[15:49:34] andreastt: Patch away (-:
[15:49:35] danielb_: thanks
[15:50:01] jimevans: simonstewart: you're right of course, and if there's a java core library that makes it easier to do, then use it. but the registry is emphatically *not* the right way to do it.
[15:50:14] simonstewart: Oh. Misunderstood you :)
[15:50:17] simonstewart: Gotcha now

[15:55:11] simonstewart: Oh. Is that what's happening?
[15:55:16] simonstewart: Teh awesome
[15:55:31] AutomatedTester: yea its MLK Jr Day
[15:55:44] jimevans: today's a holiday"?
[15:55:49] AutomatedTester: jimevans: yes
[15:55:53] AutomatedTester: apparently
[15:56:00] *jimevans forgot to use his sarcasm font.
[15:56:01] AutomatedTester: jimevans: Martin Luther King Jr Day
[15:56:14] AutomatedTester: jimevans: is Salesforce making you work?
[15:56:46] jimevans: i don't know if you'd classify it as "making". anyone who wants to take the day off as one of their floating holidays can do so.
[15:56:46] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: what do you want to discuss with jarib re BMP-rb?
[15:57:09] AutomatedTester: douche..

[15:57:50] AutomatedTester: yes
[15:58:02] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: do you have douche as a highlight word?
[15:58:22] simonstewart: When I was in India people could pick which religious holidays they wanted to observe and take it from a pool of holiday days
[15:58:26] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: not really
[15:59:02] AutomatedTester: religious holidays arent really the same as national holidays
[15:59:09] jimevans: similar thing here. i get four floating holidays every year, and have a set of days on which I can choose to use them.
[15:59:23] simonstewart: Which isn't totally unreasonable
[15:59:32] jimevans: (in addition to other "paid holidays")
[15:59:52] jimevans: i don't think it's unreasonable.

[16:02:36] AutomatedTester: thats why I am asking

[16:02:58] Ardesco: holidays
[16:03:00] Ardesco: pah 
[16:03:03] Ardesco: hate them
[16:03:05] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: No worries.  The Ruby one currently doesn't have a way to specify the port to create the proxy on or a way to specify the upstream proxy.
[16:03:07] Ardesco: there shouldn't be any
[16:03:11] simonstewart: jarib, AutomatedTester, jimevans: I'm working on series of changes to the way that the Response object works. 
[16:03:20] simonstewart: Please hold fire mirroring them until they're settled 
[16:03:29] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: ok
[16:03:29] simonstewart: Because it's not going to be pretty for a while :)
[16:03:34] jimevans: this in response to the "use strings instead of integer status codes"?
[16:03:38] simonstewart: Yeah
[16:03:52] jimevans: copy that.
[16:03:55] simonstewart: We'll end up deprecating "Response.status" and replacing it with "Response.state"
[16:04:12] simonstewart: But there's some surgery involved in the bowels of a lot of things to make it work
[16:04:24] jimevans: the IE driver guts will have to change too.
[16:04:26] simonstewart: And I'm not sure that the strings are settled yet
[16:04:33] dude-x has joined #selenium
[16:04:36] simonstewart: And opera and ghost drivers
[16:04:38] simonstewart: and firefox

[16:04:50] simonstewart: (and JS bits)
[16:04:55] simonstewart: And Android
[16:04:56] simonstewart: And iPhone
[16:04:57] nirvdrum: "state" <-- That's going to be confusing.
[16:05:11] simonstewart: response.state = "success"
[16:05:13] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: for the strings to be ratified, can we organise a video call sometime
[16:05:22] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: do we need to?
[16:05:29] AutomatedTester: well if people want to talk
[16:05:36] AutomatedTester: I am happy with them as is
[16:05:37] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Does that map to ajax request states?
[16:05:43] simonstewart: no
[16:05:49] andreastt: I don't think there's all that much to do in OperaDriver.  Wouldn't RemoteWebDriver handle that?
[16:05:54] simonstewart: in the same way that WebElement.id doesn't map to the property

[16:06:37] nirvdrum: This is for the status code?
[16:06:40] simonstewart: Yeah
[16:06:45] simonstewart: "status" -> "state"
[16:06:59] nirvdrum: "status_code" or "code" works better for me.
[16:07:08] eutheria: i've set myself up win7 with ie8 and another vm with ie9, how can i make sure in the DesiredCapabilities i can select the right vm with the desired version of ie?
[16:07:12] nirvdrum: But I don't want to bikeshed it either.
[16:07:18] simonstewart: "code" being a string is a trifle odd
[16:07:23] simonstewart: (IMO)
[16:07:52] simonstewart: eutheria: compare the Platform of the returned instance with Windows_7
[16:07:54] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: do you know why the touch events stuff have swipe vs flick?
[16:08:07] simonstewart: Flick is rude
[16:08:12] simonstewart: swipe is less rude
[16:08:17] AutomatedTester: we have flick

[16:08:31] simonstewart: Well, that was unexpected
[16:08:36] simonstewart: Actually
[16:08:38] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Well, that's just the wire protocol.  The client drivers could unmarshal to int if they wanted.
[16:08:44] simonstewart: It was "fling" I had a thing against
[16:08:59] simonstewart: Possibly
[16:09:03] simonstewart: Though the spec is going string based
[16:09:07] AutomatedTester: flinging a phone is a little OTT
[16:09:16] simonstewart: monkeys fling poo
[16:09:16] eutheria: -browser "browserName=internet explorer,version=8,platform=WINDOWS" i think is what i want when i register on the grid
[16:09:17] jimevans: simonstewart: there are many times i want to fling my mobile device. :)
[16:09:28] simonstewart: You're not alone
[16:09:30] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: serious question...
[16:09:35] simonstewart: OK

[16:09:41] simonstewart: :)
[16:10:11] jimevans: where is the code to register a node with the grid? i want to see if i can make a strontium server register with a regular grid hub.
[16:10:19] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: why do we use flick vs swipe?
[16:10:28] AutomatedTester: just 'coz
[16:10:33] AutomatedTester: ?
[16:10:39] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: because it was written for Android and Android uses flick
[16:10:48] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: danke
[16:10:54] simonstewart: If B2G had come first we'd use swipe :)
[16:11:03] nirvdrum: jimevans: Looking it up for you now.

[16:11:39] lukeis: simonstewart: that's what i'm saying...
[16:11:43] simonstewart: Though at the wire protocol level we're basically set
[16:11:44] lukeis: i know
[16:11:58] simonstewart: flick wins
[16:12:00] lukeis: what happens when a user wants to use RWD and send keys a dir :-/
[16:12:10] simonstewart: Though flick and swipe are very different actions
[16:12:11] AutomatedTester: andreastt: you're not just a pretty face are you ;)
[16:12:18] simonstewart: lukeis: we just fixed that
[16:12:23] simonstewart: we don't let it happen
[16:12:23] Ardesco: upload a dir sounds bleugh
[16:12:25] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: not really...
[16:12:25] lukeis: not for webkitdirectory
[16:12:28] lukeis: simonstewart: ^
[16:12:30] Ardesco: why would you want that
[16:12:36] Ardesco: has nobody heard of an FTP client ffs
[16:12:42] simonstewart: lukeis: technically, we'd zip the directory, punt it across the wire and unzip
[16:12:42] Ardesco: or dropbox
[16:12:50] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: according to iOS flick and swipe are the same except if you decide to handle them differently
[16:12:58] simonstewart: Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha
[16:13:01] *simonstewart falls off chair
[16:13:13] simonstewart: So they're officially "same, same but different"?

[16:13:24] simonstewart: Mother funster
[16:13:28] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: want to rant with me now?
[16:13:34] simonstewart: Not yet
[16:13:42] simonstewart: I have some code at work to swear at
[16:13:44] nirvdrum: jimevans: org.openqa.grid.internal.utils.SelfRegisteringRemote#registerToHub will show you how a request is built up.
[16:13:55] jimevans: nirvdrum: thanks mate.
[16:13:59] simonstewart: And a photo of The Boy being unbearably cute to keep me calmer
[16:14:07] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: what's the context of the question?
[16:14:26] AutomatedTester: the marionette code has flick
[16:14:33] AutomatedTester: and someone wants to change it to swipe
[16:14:40] lukeis: so, because only the standalone server handles the remote file upload trickery, do we have or should we have the standalone add a capability (in the response object of what the driver is capable of) to say it is a standalone server proxy to the browser?
[16:14:41] AutomatedTester: and I didnt know the reason
[16:14:52] AutomatedTester: but my googling shows flick is used more
[16:15:09] AutomatedTester: flick is used in Windows Phone, iOS and you told me about Android
[16:15:11] nirvdrum: jimevans: And org.openqa.grid.web.servlet.RegistrationServlet is what handles that request.
[16:15:20] simonstewart: Well, a flick is basically used to throw something off screen. A swipe is more controlled
[16:15:26] nirvdrum: jimevans: Gotta jet for a bit, but I'll be around later if you have questions.
[16:15:32] simonstewart: What's the semantics?
[16:15:50] jimevans: nirvdrum: i might not get around to it today, but that's a good start for me.
[16:15:53] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: they are saying swipe is more intuitive than flick
[16:15:56] simonstewart: BTW, you might find this useful: http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#extending-the-protocol
[16:16:04] simonstewart: Intuitive my big fat hairy arse

[16:16:23] AutomatedTester: except on iOS

[16:30:30] dawagner: FUUUUUUUUU
[16:30:59] andreastt: (-:

[16:37:35] lukeis: hope you trust us :-D
[16:37:45] dawagner: lukeis: Yes.  Yes I'm aware...
[16:37:57] dawagner: There isn't really much mischief that can be accomplished tbh
[16:38:06] dawagner: I should probably de-root that access
[16:38:12] lukeis: ;)
[16:38:21] dawagner: But it's just a VM with nothing really going on
[16:38:35] lukeis: running as a jenkins user is typically the safer approach :)
[16:38:43] dawagner: Well yeah :p
[16:38:54] dawagner: But then I'd need to remember how to suid
[16:38:57] *lukeis didn't know where that box was that could cause mischeif

[16:42:27] dawagner: <3 browsers which were designed from the ground up to be automatable
[16:43:11] dude-x: dawagner: what browsers are that?
[16:43:13] dawagner: Chrome.
[16:43:23] dude-x: huh...
[16:43:42] dude-x: Chromedriver tends to be buggy at times
[16:43:51] *lukeis was gonna say phantomjs ;)
[16:43:54] dawagner: The browser itself is huge on automated tests
[16:44:06] dawagner: Which means they don't suffer from issues where, e.g. a browser requires focus
[16:44:12] dawagner: Because that would have screwed over their tests
[16:44:27] dude-x: that's a good selling point
[16:44:45] aimbire: dawagner: i got a lot of issues with chromedriver at my side when it comes to handle file inputs

[16:51:53] Shakyj: hey, has anyone got any good examples or blog posts about using Selenium in parallel?
[16:54:16] dude-x: Shakyj: well there are several ways…. you can run selenium server in grid mode, then you'd need your test dispatcher to run tests in parallel; or you can just spawn your test runner as different processes and just use the native drivers
[16:54:29] dude-x: but i don't have any examples or blog posts off hand
[16:55:05] Shakyj: I saw someone mention on a stack post that you can use testng to parallel them, but just can't find a good example
[16:58:38] Ardesco_H: I have a bad example that needs to be updated
[16:58:40] Ardesco_H: :)
[16:58:52] Ardesco_H: https://github.com/Ardesco/Selenium-Maven-Template/blob/master/src/test/java/com/lazerycode/selenium/SeleniumBase.java
[16:59:10] Ardesco_H: the thread startup delay thing at the top is BS
[16:59:23] *Ardesco_H must have been smoking something
[16:59:53] dude-x: Ardesco_H's example is actually a critical piece, that your test runner has good configuration on how to handle different switches

[17:00:05] Shakyj: lol Ardesco_H 
[17:00:28] seljenkinsbot has joined #selenium
[17:00:46] lukeis: Shakyj: I use this https://github.com/rexhoffman/test-extensions  to run multiple 'modules' in parallel with testng. one of the modules is WebDriver :)
[17:02:16] Ardesco_H: may try and update that tonight
[17:02:29] Ardesco_H: I have code in a much more advanced state knocking around
[17:02:53] Ardesco_H: need to convert from gradle back into Java tho
[17:02:54] Shakyj: lukeis: That's prety close to what was said with the <thread> in pom.xml I just didn't find much more than that
[17:03:25] Shakyj: Ardesco_H: Yours is using grid?
[17:03:49] Ardesco_H: It can do
[17:03:57] Ardesco_H: grid is just another end point
[17:04:09] Ardesco_H: add in a case remot
[17:04:12] *dawagner bounces jenkins
[17:04:27] Ardesco_H: Right now it's not a good example, it may give you some hints
[17:04:31] Ardesco_H: I need to fix it
[17:05:02] Ardesco_H: I've been using groovy and gradle for the past few months and going back to pure Java is a bit painful
[17:05:02] dude-x: the real key is a test dispatcher that runs things in parallel
[17:05:03] Ardesco_H: :)
[17:05:44] dude-x: my prior job, we had a script that would randomly dispatch tests, and launch two JVMs that would spawn one firefox instance
[17:05:49] Ardesco_H: thats what the threadlocal stuff is dioing in my code
[17:06:04] Ardesco_H: basically builds a pool of driver objects
[17:06:24] Ardesco_H: it uses TESTNG to create each test function as a separate thread
[17:06:59] dawagner: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/testing/ParallelSuite.java is a fairly trivial JUnit4 way of doing parallelism
[17:08:09] Shakyj: The massive problem we are having is it sometimes takes up to an hour to complete which ties up that server for that length of time. We need to be able to run multiple tests on a server at the same and grid isn't really an option
[17:08:31] Ardesco: although bear in mind that if you have a problem
[17:08:36] Ardesco: and threading is the solution
[17:08:45] Ardesco: you will soon two have problems

[19:47:17] krosenvold_: s/for/fork/
[19:48:23] phishy: I'm really interested in recorders as well, just trying to figure out the status quo and where to begin helping.
[19:48:24] jimevans: sigh. i don't have time to take on another "shit work no one else is willing to do" project.
[19:49:40] lukeis: jimevans - the new IDE / Builder project lead :-D
[19:49:42] barancev: lukeis: I'll learn git :)
[19:50:48] phishy: Yesterday I wrote about it, http://bit.ly/VTLEjR.
[19:51:16] phishy: Then I found that Google BITE project, which I haven't quite compiled correctly yet. I'm still trying to figure out how to get Selenium to test my JS correctly. I think I'm just stupid.
[19:51:35] jimevans: i'll say it right now, i am absolutely *NOT* the right person for that job. it takes a level of UI-building skill that i don't have, and it's a tool that i actively, loudly, vociferously, and repeatedly say i don't use, won't use, and don't think will lead to maintainable code.
[19:51:55] krosenvold_: jimevans: Calm down ;)
[19:51:57] *lukeis pokes the bear

[19:52:24] smccarthy has joined #selenium
[19:52:34] jimevans: krosenvold_: no, sir, i don't think i will.
[19:53:14] jimevans: phishy: quite simply, because it leads to inelegant code, unmaintainable code, and the belief that automated testing isn't software development, which it is.
[19:53:37] krosenvold_: And we agree with jimevans on this ;)
[19:54:21] phishy: Sure, it's like the WYSIWYG days. I get it. However,
[19:54:44] phishy: What about the idea of recording a test, then if it breaks, just recording it again?
[19:55:03] lukeis: x500 and that's a maintenance nightmare
[19:55:10] phishy: Anyone ever heard of that Google BITE project?
[19:55:37] phishy: Or uTest or whoever it is now.
[19:56:03] jimevans: phishy: let me answer that question with another question: suppose your first step in every test is to click on a specific link, and it's *that* link that's changed. would you be willing to re-record *every* *single* *test* in your repository?
[19:56:16] phishy: shit.
[19:56:34] phishy: I guess that's why they went crazy with some fuzzy-matching magic
[19:56:43] phishy: Or ways to rectify broken-ass tests
[19:56:45] barancev: jimevans: context replace, awk is your friend :)
[19:57:01] phishy: Or abstract that step
[19:57:09] lukeis: and with that you're now coding ;)
[19:57:11] phishy: Give it a UUID, replace the URL and blammo
[19:58:29] jimevans: phishy: okay, as lukeis says, now your record-playback grammar has to develop the idea of variables.
[19:58:59] lukeis: my idea to have IDE done better would be to incorporate a loader of :wiki pageobjects
[19:58:59] jimevans: suppose you want to repeat a number of steps in your recording tool (not an uncommon request, btw).

[20:00:51] lukeis: likely… but i'd have to actually look at that site :)
[20:01:10] phishy: Yeah that would be hard. Hyperlinking is an arduous journey.

[20:04:43] tzafrir_laptop: Is it possible to switch to a new window using scripts run from the selenium IDE?
[20:05:13] tzafrir_laptop: (Is there any complete reference for its scripts anywhere?)
[20:06:23] nirvdrum: jimevans: Spit 'em out.
[20:07:21] jimevans: nirvdrum: what should the body of the registration message look like? assume i have another remote protocol-compliant server listening on <ip>:<port>/wd/hub. should it also be listening on something else?
[20:09:44] nirvdrum: I'll have to capture a payload for you.  I just use the Java API.
[20:10:00] nirvdrum: But it has an ID, capabilities, and a couple other optional things.

[20:12:53] phishy: lukeis: right. So that's what I experienced also. In the commends I actually left SIDE code that works.
[20:13:09] Guest1868 has joined #selenium
[20:13:40] phishy: lukeis: My original question was, why cannot the record discern what's happening. Then I was wondering if it was technically possible to discern automatically.. or does a human actually have to do it.
[20:13:59] phishy: and that's when I found Google BITE which purports to be able to do it.. so again… is it possible, I don't know..
[20:14:28] phishy: So I'm trying to learn about the status quo of record/playback with WebDriver or JavaScript
[20:14:44] lukeis: it's likely possible.. this is a case where there are many dom elements that visually occupy the same space
[20:15:04] lukeis: something like this I would not use IDE :_
[20:15:05] lukeis: :)
[20:15:13] phishy: Clearly after I click something, JavaScript swaps element in/out of place
[20:15:24] phishy: and then the recorder has no idea what has happened
[20:15:37] nirvdrum: jimevans: This undoubtedly has a lot of crap you don't need, but it should be helpful: https://gist.github.com/4588965

[20:54:51] jimevans: phishy: spent about 10 minutes on this (then some more cleaning up and documenting the code), but here's WebDriver code that works for your example. https://gist.github.com/4589342
[20:56:07] jimevans: (note, that's in C#, but the Java code would look incredibly similar)
[20:56:54] lukeis: i was doing something similar in python, but with chrome… it thought the text input element wasn't visible, so that blocked me from continuing
[20:57:30] jimevans: lukeis: the tricky bit is to send "enter" before anything else, to make the text area element visible
[20:58:14] lukeis: ah, with action chains none-the-less
