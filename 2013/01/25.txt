[15:32:21] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[15:34:16] Cryp71c has joined #selenium
[15:36:01] Cryp71c: Is using one client driver over any other client driver largely preference for in what language you want the test suites (for selenium) written in, or is there a significant difference in performance/functionality?
[15:40:26] Phil37: i don't think language matters as much as the browser
[15:41:04] Cryp71c: Phil37, well, yeah I'm aware that browser to browser will affect page rendering, javascript behavior, javascript performance, etc. etc.
[15:41:26] Cryp71c: Its been a long time since I used Selenium (since RC, and when a PHP driver was native), and I was curious about, say...c++ vs python
[15:41:34] Phil37: tests on internet explorer have always been faster than firefox, that's the only comparison i'm aware of
[15:42:04] jimevans: Phil37: i think you've got that backwards.
[15:42:28] Phil37: slower I mean yeah, sorry
[15:43:20] jimevans: Cryp71c: the bottleneck is not very likely to be in the processing speed of the client language. the language bindings for .NET, Java, Python, and Ruby are all reasonably performant and have a similar feature set.
[15:43:34] Cryp71c: um, yeah..hehe...ran some javascript performance measurements and - on whatever site it was - IE performed at "178" or something, and firefox was in the 1k range :P
[15:44:16] smccarthy has joined #selenium
[15:44:27] jimevans: Cryp71c: to be fair, 32-bit IE9 or 10 should perform much better on the javascript benchmarks.
[15:44:51] Cryp71c: jimevans, thanks! The other question I have now that I"m browsing around is that the python bindings for selenium appear to only be available for linux (or perhaps that's just python's "normal" distribution facility: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium), have you had any experience with running python-written tests from windows boxes?
[15:44:59] Cryp71c: jimevans, yeah, this was 32-bit IE8, I believe.
[15:45:19] jimevans: AutomatedTester: you're up! ^^
[15:45:45] *jimevans isn't a python guy.
[15:45:52] AutomatedTester: Cryp71c: where does it say its only for Linux?
[15:46:23] AutomatedTester: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium shows its for windows/osx/linux
[15:46:23] Cryp71c: AutomatedTester, er, rather I'm being a bit presumptive, the only distribution package is a tar.gz and the configuration/installation documentation appears to be unix-specific: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium
[15:46:24] cgoldberg: Cryp71c, you can install from PyPI on windows.  
[15:46:32] Cryp71c: Ah, yeah that's my bad, sorry.
[15:47:03] cgoldberg: Cryp71c, you need to install setuptools/easy_install or pip 
[15:47:14] cgoldberg: then 'pip install selenium'
[15:48:21] jleyba has joined #selenium
[15:48:34] Cryp71c: cgoldberg, and all of this needs to be setup on the system running the selenium webdriver server?
[15:48:50] Cryp71c: or on every system running the tests?
[15:49:11] cgoldberg: Cryp71c, wherever the python bindings live in your setup
[15:49:47] cgoldberg: Cryp71c, optionally, you can untar the distribution and just run: python setup.py install
[15:50:37] Cryp71c: cgoldberg, ah, right...I knew I had done something different in the past, rather than using pip.
[15:50:50] cgoldberg: Cryp71c, pip just makes it easier
[15:51:36] Cryp71c: When "commands" get sent from the webdriver server to the clients (say, in a grid), they are being sent in the client-driver language, correct?
[15:53:41] jimevans: Cryp71c: i'm not sure what that means.
[15:55:52] Cryp71c: jimevans, if I run selenium tests in a gird environment, and the selenium tests are written in python, does every computer in the grid need python (and the python client-driver) installed?
[15:57:27] dude-x: Cryp71c: selenium standalone is just a jar, so that means every node needs Java and a web browser; however the test dispatcher can use any language
[15:58:49] jimevans: Cryp71c: no, if you're running grid, each machine ("node") in the grid will need java, and you'll be using the java language bindings for the actual test execution on the remote machine. the "test runner", that is, whatever you use to actually execute your python code (pytest? nose? i really don't know what the python test ecosystem is like) will have python on it.
[15:59:14] jleyba: with git, how do i revert all changes in my working directory? (e.g. svn revert -R .)

[18:20:53] jimevans: Applejuice: that's a test runner problem, not a webdriver problem. it's been awhile since i used visual studio's test management/test runner, but it used to be that in order to run tests in parallel, you needed to have a rig with test agents set up on it.

[19:00:50] Applejuice: can someone help me understand the difference between SetUpFixture and TestFixtureSetUp?
[19:01:23] jtsan: hey, I'm having trouble getting multiple RemoteWebDriver tests to run in parallel using Grid2. It seems that when one browser closes it causes the other test to fail. I am using one machine to run tests in parallel. Does anyone know what would be causing this? I am seeing the error, "Error communicating with the remote browser. It may have died."
[19:02:29] nirvdrum: jtsan: You're not sharing session IDs or anything are you?
[19:02:43] jtsan: I don't think so
[19:02:57] jtsan: does it by default?
[19:03:19] smccarthy: if I start selenium-server-standalone as just a selenium server (not grid), do I need to pass the webdriver.chrome.driver property in that same command?
[19:03:25] nirvdrum: The grid doesn't, no.  But if your client connections aren't threadsafe I could see that happening.
[19:03:48] nirvdrum: smccarthy: Grid startup should not affect that.
[19:04:29] jtsan: how could i make them thread safe? I see on the wiki it says, "Starting 1 browser per thread at       the start of the test-run and deallocating all browsers at the end       is not a good idea." and this is exactly what I'm doing
[19:05:25] nirvdrum: jtsan: Are you using a distributed runner like in TestNG or junit-parallel ?
[19:05:46] jtsan: no
[19:05:50] SupplyCrawler: Uh
[19:06:02] SupplyCrawler: Is the only way I can kill a hung-up Chrome/Chromedriver to just

[19:06:34] jtsan: Right now I have... Create RemoteWebDriver -> run test -> Close Browser and these get run in parallel on a JBoss server
[19:06:37] jleyba: jimevans: ping
[19:06:51] jimevans: jleyba: pong
[19:07:27] nirvdrum: jtsan: You run your tests on a JBoss server?
[19:07:37] smccarthy: nirvdrum: I get the error that webdriver.chrome.driver is not set on this line "driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(HUB_HOST), cap);" , but the line before that I do "System.out.println(System.getProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver"));" and it prints correct. Any idea why I would get the error still ?
[19:08:17] nirvdrum: smccarthy: Well System.getProperty is going to give you the setting on the client machine.  You're likely getting the error from the remote machine.
[19:08:32] nirvdrum: I.e., where the browser would be invoked.
[19:08:37] jtsan: yeah the company I work for scrapes invoices off sites for their customers. Customers upload files to our sites containing the invoice numbers and run the file which then creates a new RemoteWebDriver instance
[19:09:00] noahsussman has joined #selenium
[19:09:24] smccarthy: nirvdrum: the selenium server is my local machine, where the code is running.
[19:09:25] nirvdrum: jtsan: Then I guess you just need to do standard thread safety best practices.  Keep your client instances local and such.
[19:10:05] nirvdrum: smccarthy: The point stands.  That System.getProperty() isn't going to show you what the server settings are, unless you're running in an embedded mode.
[19:10:26] nirvdrum: jtsan: If you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend Java Concurrency in Practice.
[19:10:45] jtsan: cool thanks
[19:11:54] smccarthy: nirvdrum: but if I do this when I start the selenium server, java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.28.0.jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver_mac_26.0.1383.0 , shouldn't it find the system property?
[19:11:59] nirvdrum: jtsan: I'm not familiar with the Java client API (I mostly do client access through Ruby), but if you log out the WebDriver session ID from both, you should be able to see if things are conflicting.
[19:12:18] nirvdrum: smccarthy: Yes.  I'm just saying your debug strategy is flawed.
[19:12:35] nirvdrum: Since you're checking the wrong JVM instance.
[19:13:00] jtsan: nirvdrum, in what ways can they conflict?
[19:13:13] smccarthy: nirvdrum: ok thx
[19:14:11] nirvdrum: jtsan: The WebDriver protocol requires a unique session ID be used to route commands.  If two clients are using the same session ID and one shuts down the browser, the other will have problems because no browser exists with that session ID.
[19:14:13] jleyba: jimevans: for synthetic events in the IEDriver, is the mouse/keyboard state tracked per session, or do you reset it on page loads?
[19:14:40] nirvdrum: jtsan: But, you could still see two browsers because the client request may have gone through and the grid created the browser.  But then the client mishandles the session.
[19:15:12] nirvdrum: Obviously I'm just spitballing here.  But it sounds like like have a race condition at the very least.  And likely unprotected state being mutated by multiple threads.
[19:15:18] jtsan: that sounds exactly like what's happening
[19:16:04] jtsan: nirvdrum: so do i just generate a random session ID each time I create an instance of RemoteWebDriver?
[19:16:07] jimevans: jleyba: it's persistent across page loads.
[19:16:28] nirvdrum: jtsan: The grid returns the session ID as a response to the create browser session request.
[19:16:46] nirvdrum: You can see the session IDs in the grid log.
[19:17:42] nirvdrum: The chain is: client makes request to hub, hub finds a node (or waits until one is available), hub requests session from node, node creates browser session and returns session ID, hub returns session ID to client.
[19:17:54] jimevans: jleyba: there is an InputManager class that handles mouse and keyboard inputs, and this is created once per command executor.
[19:18:28] jimevans: s/command executor/session/
[19:18:33] jleyba: Ok. Starting to implement the interactions API for Safari and was just curious how state should be persisted
[19:19:34] jtsan: So in my case it's likely that the node is returning matching session ids for two separate instances of RemoteWebDriver?
[19:19:40] jimevans: my thoughts were that if you manually move the mouse to a location on the screen, and click, which causes a navigation, the mouse pointer would still be there the next time you tried to move it.
[19:19:40] jtsan: what would cause this?
[19:20:50] nirvdrum: jtsan: I'm suggesting you log the session ID from the clients to verify this.

[20:57:46] dogarrhea: heh. i've seen about 4 job descriptions now.  when it says "selenium", for some reason they need a dev ops/build engineer.
[20:57:54] dogarrhea: why is this the case?
[20:58:27] dogarrhea: "need selenium experience" to improve ant/maven build times/set up jenkin builds/automated environment switching and tests
[20:58:31] dogarrhea: ??
[20:59:17] dogarrhea: i guess this makes sense.  selenium only opens browser windows and runs javascript.

[IRC logfile - Started Fri Jan 25 21:00:08 2013]
[21:00:08] p_l: also, devops includes testing
[21:00:28] dude-x: i was reading a 'discussion' about how someone hates camel case on Java. And it had me thinkingâ€¦. one problem with programming is that we overuse symbolsâ€¦. what if we just invent a programming keyboard. instead of quotes for strings, we use a token that represents only a programming string, so this way we don't have to escape strings. And a symbol that represents a string to be escaped, replaced. and a symbol that means assignment, so
[21:00:38] dogarrhea: selenium seems totally unrelated to dev ops
[21:00:46] dude-x: oh dogarrhea, you just love to troll
[21:00:55] p_l: there's a great post from imvu about continuous integration which included how they used selenium
[21:01:18] dude-x: it's funny.
[21:01:20] p_l: dogarrhea: selenium => tool for integration/acceptance testing => acceptance testing in devops
[21:01:44] p_l: dude-x: look up APL and find out why it's not done :)
[21:01:50] dogarrhea: dude-x grow a brain
[21:02:27] p_l: dude-x: also, a lot of camel-case in java seems related to origins of JavaBeans, where you had to manually adhere to strict naming conventions so the tools could find them
[21:02:27] dude-x: dogarrhea: you can say whatever you want. It doesn't change that you like to pop in and just say inflammatory comments and then leave.
[21:02:43] dogarrhea: dude-x i have industry experience. 
[21:03:12] dude-x: p_l:  i understand the use of naming conventions, and i think they're very useful
[21:03:27] dude-x: but i think programming could benefit from having special symbols that are not in our typography
[21:04:05] dude-x: dogarrhea: prove your worth by blogging, and constructive criticism
[21:04:23] dude-x: otherwise you're just a blip of entertainment...
[21:05:03] stephend_: we all have "industry experience"
[21:05:31] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[21:05:36] dogarrhea: do you notice this trend stephend_?
[21:05:42] dogarrhea: selenium somehow equates to devops
[21:05:48] stephend_: not really, no
[21:06:01] dogarrhea: they some how equate "automated testing" to "automated everything" job
[21:06:08] stephend_: seems to me you have an agenda or pre-conceived notion and are somehow self-confirming it
[21:06:33] lukeis: selenium == browser automation.  note the lack of the word 'testing'
[21:06:48] dogarrhea: agenda? this is what recruiters say are part of a selenium job description
[21:07:15] stephend: of the 4 you looked at; huge sample, that.
[21:07:24] stephend: I'm not saying Selenium isn't popular, or not a part of it
[21:07:29] stephend: but it's not the only thing
[21:07:29] dude-x: p_l: i will look up APL to see how it used symbols

[21:12:37] dude-x: i'll say that once you go beyond writing tests, in trying to parallelize the tests, there is a bit of dev ops involved
[21:17:44] jtsan has joined #selenium
[21:20:03] jtsan: is using grid required to run test in parallel on the same machine or can i just run the default standalone server? 
[21:21:14] dude-x: jtsan: you don't need grid to run in parallel on the same machine
[21:21:23] jtsan: thanks
[21:21:28] dude-x: you can spawn differnet processes or threads for each driver instance
[21:21:40] Archdude has joined #selenium
[21:21:50] dogarrhea: seems like running on same machine doesn't buy you much if bandwidth remains the same
[21:22:10] dude-x: in my prior job, i had 40 instances of Chrome hit one webserver
[21:23:05] dude-x: on a decent machine you can probably 15-20 instances if you have 8GB of RAM and network bandwidth
[21:23:29] jtsan: is it possible to close driver by session id? I think when I call driver.close() it's closing the most recent session not the session I want to close
[21:23:46] jtsan: recently created*
[21:23:59] dude-x: jtsan: you need to be able to separate the driver instances either via threads or processes

[21:36:52] dogarrhea: what kind of Internet connection do you have access to?
[21:37:17] dogarrhea: i guess some enterprise T1 doesn't get throttled like a time whorener cable connection does
[21:37:25] cgoldberg: T1?
[21:37:33] cgoldberg: whoa welcome to the 90's :)
[21:38:21] AutomatedTester: someone in my team has a t1 
[21:38:33] dude-x: it's probably cheap today
[21:38:34] AutomatedTester: be he lives in the wilderness in Virginia
[21:38:42] cgoldberg: dogarrhea, but i don't often run tests over WAN anyway
[21:38:45] dude-x: in the 90's it was 800-1200 bucks a month
[21:38:45] AutomatedTester: it costs him $500 a month
[21:39:00] AutomatedTester: he is 15 miles from the nearest town
[21:39:02] dude-x: and mozilla doesn't pick up the bill?
[21:39:07] AutomatedTester: nope
[21:39:08] cgoldberg: i knew someone a few years ago who was using isdn
[21:39:11] AutomatedTester: he has to pay
[21:39:22] dude-x: well a t1 has low latency so that's nice
[21:39:33] cgoldberg: i've got 100 mbit cable.. but comast owns me
[21:39:37] AutomatedTester: low latency and low speed
[21:39:47] cgoldberg: 1.54 mbit is T1
[21:39:54] *cgoldberg remembers back to school days
[21:40:08] dude-x: i have 101 mbit with cablevision/optimum
[21:40:14] stephend: ISDN
[21:40:18] *stephend shudders
[21:40:42] dude-x: i've only seen isdn used for video conferencing setups in the 90's/early 00's
[21:41:15] *cgoldberg blows dust off the Zoom 14.4k modem

[21:41:32] stephend: ISDN is/was notoriously unreliable
[21:41:40] dogarrhea: hrm. at one point in time selenium was advertised as "cloud testing". what happened to that campaign?
[21:41:42] dude-x: i did tech support in the late 90's, some of my client companies would dial into AOL
[21:41:42] stephend: but hey, 128k was a lot back then
[21:41:44] stephend: even 64k
[21:42:07] nirvdrum: jimevans: This is a long shot, but you don't have any insight into why IE8 gets stuck downloading 1 resource, do you?
[21:42:25] cgoldberg: i used dialup from 1200 baud days until this millenium on a 56k
[21:42:52] dude-x: i went from 1200 baud, then 14.4Kbit
[21:42:54] nirvdrum: T1 is 24 64 kbps channels.  Another way to remember the math.
[21:43:02] dude-x: so i missed out on 2400, 9600
[21:43:15] AutomatedTester: stephend: bc has a T1
[21:43:17] nirvdrum: So a T1 is 24 phone lines.
[21:43:21] jimevans: nirvdrum: sorry, no.
[21:43:22] stephend: AutomatedTester: yeah, I read
[21:43:37] jimevans: no ideas off the top of the head.
[21:43:41] stephend: better than satellite, at least, for some stuff
[21:43:43] nirvdrum: jimevans: Poopy.  I don't mind debugging it, but I have no clue where to start.  And it only seems to affect IE8 :-/
[21:43:44] stephend: since it's symmetrical
[21:43:46] stephend: which satellite isn't
[21:43:57] stephend: a T1's rate is guaranteed
[21:43:59] cgoldberg: i took my CS courses and did homework dialed in on a 14.4k dialup modem... to a a Vax running Ultrix (that had 128 meg ram to serve about 100 users).. old skizzle
[21:44:17] stephend: fo shizzle
[21:44:25] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: wow...
[21:44:41] AutomatedTester: my first modem was a 56k
[21:44:47] stephend: V.92 or kflex?
[21:44:50] stephend: or v.90
[21:45:02] AutomatedTester: I cant remember
[21:45:02] dogarrhea: my earliest isp experience was prodigy
[21:45:23] cgoldberg: mine was compuserve
[21:45:27] dude-x: i grew up on BBS's then compuserve
[21:45:33] nirvdrum: I think I got a juno email account before I had web access.
[21:45:35] cgoldberg: then went to university and saw real internet
[21:45:46] cgoldberg: dude-x, i was a bbs'er too

[21:46:31] dude-x: cgoldberg: compuserve let me surf the internet in 94, then in 95 i was able to get on to the internet via ethernet. very nice to have 4mbit access

[21:49:14] dude-x: then again anyone talking to me live was scary
[21:50:07] martin_c: does selenium strip out the Origin request header? my websocket server isn't getting it, in order to set Access-Control-Allow-Origin (wildcard isn't an option).
[21:50:09] cgoldberg: dude-x, fun times.. I had a 386 then 486 when I was BBS'ing.. i was king of DOS :)
[21:50:48] *lukeis had a token ring network growing up (my dad was a network engineer)â€¦ also he always put two modems (w/ two phone lines) to help 'boost' our speed ;)
[21:51:43] dude-x: ha neat
[21:52:10] dude-x: i just got an email from a recruiter looking for a 'support engineer' to work for Palantir, the CIA data mining company 
[21:52:26] stephend: dude-x: heh
[21:52:31] dude-x: .uhhh no thanks
[21:52:34] stephend: I got a couple buddies who work there
[21:52:42] stephend: they do remote?
[21:52:45] stephend: cuz they're in palo alto

[21:53:02] stephend: ah
[21:53:45] AutomatedTester: I had an Engineering Director email me today asking if I wanted to start up their engineering services/productivity section
[21:54:01] dude-x: that's hilarious
[21:54:30] cgoldberg: dude-x, i've been contacted by them.  shady
[21:54:31] AutomatedTester: why hilarious?
[21:54:45] AutomatedTester: my thing or your thing?
[21:55:20] dude-x: AutomatedTester: i interpreted your request as an engineering director wanting someone to start an engineering section, when it should be his responsibility?
[21:56:41] dogarrhea: sounds like a non technical position
[21:58:21] AutomatedTester: dude-x: he wants someone to create a specific team
[21:58:30] AutomatedTester: dude-x: its a management role
[21:59:09] cgoldberg: management is too far from code :)
[21:59:15] AutomatedTester: dude-x: a directors job is to put people in the right place to make things happen
[21:59:25] lukeis: my thoughts exactly cgoldberg ;)

[22:06:28] jimevans: martin_c: selenium RC or selenium webdriver?
[22:06:52] martin_c: jimevans: still just RC
[22:07:13] martin_c: i suppose i could move to webdriver to see if that fixes this...

[22:08:54] Ardesco_H: heh
[22:09:11] jimevans: martin_c: webdriver shouldn't be messing with the request at all. rc in some cases acts as a proxy, so it might, in fact, be modifying the request. but then i actively avoid having in-depth knowledge of rc. :)
