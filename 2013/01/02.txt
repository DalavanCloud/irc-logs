[IRC logfile - Started Wed Jan  2 10:00:04 2013]
[10:00:04] Mark__: hi 
[10:00:59] Ardesco: Selenium IDE will show you a list of all available commands
[10:01:18] Ardesco: so you just need to look through the list and then select any that look appropriate
[10:01:28] Ardesco: it will give you a description of what the command does
[10:02:20] Ardesco: I would guess the command is something similar to VerifyText, or AssertText (Depending on if you want the test to stop at that point or fail and continue

[10:04:43] csmrfx: Hello! Is it possible to use Selenium IDE "recursively"? I would like to mine links from the target page and run test on them too
[10:05:00] csmrfx: (within one and the same domain, though)
[10:08:24] koshie: I've on a website a window generated with js (into the firefox window, of course) and I want to select this one but I don't do that correctly... I've tried by using "Select Window" keywords with title, name... The ID... An other idea ?
[10:08:31] koshie: Selenium2 + RobotFramework
[10:09:01] koshie: (last Selenium)
[10:09:49] koshie: This is the line which is added into HTML file by js to generate the window :   <div id="dossier-dlg" style="display: none;">
[10:10:14] Ardesco: doesn't sound like a window
[10:10:17] csmrfx: koshie I think you'd want to focus on selecting that one desired window
[10:10:18] Ardesco: sounds like a lightbox
[10:10:51] koshie: csmrfx: I've tried without and there is a kind of conflict if I don't say rubbish, let me check and i'll tell you
[10:11:41] csmrfx: koshie: is that a window, a separate browser window with it's own document?
[10:12:17] csmrfx: (or just a "element that looks like a window" in the same document?
[10:12:20] koshie: To be precise, I want to input text into two fields in this js window, id_last_name and id_first_name but if I don't select this window there is on the page (which is basically without the window until I click on a button) two other fields with id_last_name and id_first_name too...
[10:12:28] koshie: csmrfx: element that looks like a window
[10:12:39] koshie: it's not a window managed by the WM but by firefox :)
[10:12:39] csmrfx: So, use the id selector?
[10:12:53] koshie: I've tried, but it doesn't works. I think I'm not doing this correctly.
[10:13:03] csmrfx: maybe it is generated dynamically
[10:13:09] koshie: Yeah it is.
[10:13:13] csmrfx: doesn't exist until you CLICK on something first
[10:13:18] koshie: Yes
[10:13:21] koshie: exactly.
[10:13:22] csmrfx: so?
[10:13:51] koshie: So I've tried to use the id, "dossier-dlg" but it match any element on the webpage. 
[10:14:33] csmrfx: Not sure which selenium you are using, but on mine there is "open" 
[10:14:43] koshie: ValueError: Unable to locate window with name or title 'dossier-dlg' csmrfx with the code : Select Window  dossier-dlg
[10:14:46] csmrfx: try using that on whatever opens the window
[10:15:04] koshie: Using Selenium2.9.1 with RobotFramework.
[10:15:14] koshie: What do you mean ?
[10:15:14] csmrfx: is that IDE or RC?
[10:15:28] csmrfx: koshie: look "open" from the documentation
[10:15:34] koshie: csmrfx: ok, thanks
[10:15:36] AutomatedTester: pa: Marionette is still in development
[10:15:43] koshie: and I don't know what IDE and RC means.
[10:16:22] koshie: the keyword is just call "Open" right ?
[10:16:33] csmrfx: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6995016/what-is-the-difference-between-selenium-ide-server-rc-2-0-and-webdriver
[10:16:43] koshie: Using webdriver.
[10:17:21] AutomatedTester: koshie: IDE is the Firefox Addon, RC is our old API for programming languages, WebDriver is our new API for programming languages
[10:17:57] koshie: I see, thanks
[10:18:00] koshie: so using the last :)
[10:18:01] csmrfx: The function open works like "open /somethin/foo/bar"
[10:18:17] csmrfx: (on Selenium IDE that I use)
[10:18:43] AutomatedTester: koshie: IDE is good for learning, RC is frozen and isnt having any work on it, webdriver is being maintained and becoming a W3C Standard
[10:18:58] csmrfx: Aaand, open works on links, <a> -tags, so if your lightbox is not opened from a link, you will need to try something else
[10:19:27] csmrfx: Perhaps, you are trying to test something that is javascript based, which will give you headaches
[10:19:50] *csmrfx would like to do js testing on capybara or similar)
[10:22:25] csmrfx: Ideas for getting Selenium IDE to run tests on any linked pages as well as the current (within same domain)?

[10:24:27] alexglow has joined #selenium
[10:26:53] koshie: csmrfx: I'm supposed to use open to click on the url of the button to display the window is js, right ? With that I'll be able to choose the window to avoid my conflict?
[10:27:11] koshie: (using open instead of Click Element)
[10:27:34] csmrfx: You would need to know HOW does the lightbox open?
[10:27:54] csmrfx: imo, open and click are one and the same
[10:27:58] csmrfx: (?)
[10:28:19] *csmrfx is lightweight selenium user
[10:28:32] koshie: Plus I'm not using Java or this kind of langage but the RobotFramework syntax ^^
[10:28:46] csmrfx: Yeah no idea about that
[10:29:06] koshie: I don't need to call an other library right ? Open is in selenium2library ?

[10:37:04] pa: AutomatedTester, meaning selenium still doesnt support it?
[10:37:21] AutomatedTester: pa: no, not yet
[10:37:39] AutomatedTester: We, Mozilla, havent got Marionette in release builds of Firefox yet
[10:37:55] pa: ah i see..
[10:37:59] pa: thanks
[10:38:07] AutomatedTester: pa: what do you need from Marionette?
[10:38:35] pa: essentially nothing. But i need to drive multiple tabs with selenium
[10:38:45] pa: and apparently it is not supported, at the moment
[10:39:18] AutomatedTester: no but clicking a link that normally opens a tab will open a new window in webdriver
[10:39:27] pa: yes, indeed
[10:39:34] AutomatedTester: and then you switch window
[10:39:43] AutomatedTester: plus marionette doesnt have tab switch, yet
[10:39:47] pa: and what i would like to have is a webdriver without multiple windows, that instead is able to drive multiple tabs
[10:40:11] pa: AutomatedTester, the weird thing is that webdriver in ruby can drive the tabs
[10:40:15] pa: but in python it cant
[10:40:27] AutomatedTester: really?
[10:40:31] pa: i heared so
[10:40:41] AutomatedTester: Can you show me an example?
[10:40:51] pa: i can probably find it out
[10:40:57] pa: among the filed bugs
[10:40:59] pa: moment
[10:41:09] AutomatedTester: jarib: yt?
[10:42:36] pa: AutomatedTester, so,  i need to search the logs for the ruby code that some user here wrote to test my code. Anyway, I was reported that the equivalent of this, in ruby, does work: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=3380
[10:42:53] pa: i'll try to find it now, let see
[10:43:48] AutomatedTester: without the example I cant see about fixing it
[10:44:09] AutomatedTester: AFAIK FirefoxDriver doesnt work on multiple tabs
[10:44:18] AutomatedTester: works on multiple windows but not tabs
[10:44:35] pa: i was pasted this
[10:44:36] pa: https://gist.github.com/1838333
[10:44:40] pa: i search more, moment
[10:45:05] AutomatedTester: python code does the same as a the ruby code in that situation
[10:46:18] pa: hm, but llaskin reported it to work, e.g., to be able to switch between tabs, in ruby
[10:46:28] pa: this almost a year ago
[10:46:44] pa: essentially there is a unique handle for each tab
[10:47:00] AutomatedTester: well he will need to show me how that works
[10:47:30] AutomatedTester: since both Python and Ruby(and all other languages) just do an http call into the browser asking for the window handles 
[10:48:17] pa: i should probably try to create a full example in ruby
[10:48:18] pa: let see
[10:48:20] pa: never used ruby
[10:48:47] AutomatedTester: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/remote/commands.rb#35 <- ruby command
[10:49:34] AutomatedTester: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/remote/remote_connection.py#153 <- python command
[10:50:35] pa: AutomatedTester, but in general is it a big issue to drive tabs, in firefox?
[10:50:47] AutomatedTester: at the moment, yes

[12:08:12] pa: whats the ruby equivalent of profile.update_preference() ?
[12:10:40] jimevans: simonstewart: saw your reply. one question: i took you to mean "if we ever implement command batching for all commands, revisit this endpoint." did i interpret correctly?
[12:25:45] pa: any ruby guy here? i try to set firefox preferences via profile['prefname'] = value, but it doesnt seem to work, and when i open about:config in the spawned firefox, the preference is not set as i defined in ruby..
[12:26:30] csmrfx: I think something else is wrong
[12:26:37] csmrfx: I dont know what you are using
[12:26:46] csmrfx: but that syntax is correct
[12:26:57] csmrfx: (ruby wise)
[12:28:28] pa: i have a very simple script, let me pastebin it
[12:29:01] csmrfx: gist or pastie plz!
[12:29:25] pa: http://codepad.org/UfqqyjWB
[12:29:46] pa: i can repaste in gist, if needed
[12:30:41] pa: if i run this script, and then i go in about:config, those prefs are not set
[12:43:58] csmrfx: ok, lets see
[12:44:31] csmrfx: pa 1. Does the webdriver work for your particular version of firefox, nevertheless?
[12:44:52] pa: csmrfx, yes, with python it does work properly
[12:45:06] pa: and the property is also properly set
[12:45:33] pa: i'm essentially trying to convert a simple python script to ruby
[12:45:34] csmrfx: but the driver can drive your ff?
[12:45:57] csmrfx: IOW, only the properties do not work?
[12:46:47] pa: csmrfx, this is the python script that im trying to convert https://gist.github.com/4434379
[12:46:53] pa: csmrfx, yes, the driver can drive ff
[12:46:59] pa: only props do not work
[12:47:13] pa: i dont know if it is because it opens the wrong profile, or simply because it cant set the props
[12:47:36] csmrfx: imo syntax is correct
[12:48:03] csmrfx: so, no errors outputted?
[12:48:18] pa: no, just that i should use a different JSON library
[12:48:58] pa: but is profile = Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Profile.from_name "seleniumtest" equivalent to python  profilePath = "/home/paolo/.mozilla/firefox/xfmmkn0g.seleniumtest" ; profile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile(profilePath).
[12:49:46] pa: sorry, that was a question :)
[12:50:00] csmrfx: I can't say, never used python selenium webdriver
[12:51:21] pa: yes, that seems to be equivalent. I also tried to pre-set the properties in firefox
[12:51:24] csmrfx: also, gtg for a while
[12:51:28] csmrfx: bbl, gl!
[12:51:37] pa: but it seems that when firefox is launched with selenium, props get resetted
[12:51:40] pa: ok thanks :)
[12:52:50] pa: i suspect other props wouldnt be resetted, let me see
[12:53:45] pa: indeed..
[12:53:57] pa: other props are kept, these are re-setted
[12:54:15] pa: i assume this is done in ruby bindings, coz with python this works
[12:56:49] pa: indeed, in prefs.json of the gem

[14:23:43] Ardesco: trying out the latest release of thunderbird and i'm enjoying it.
[14:23:50] Ardesco: Come on a long way since I last tried
[14:24:09] Ardesco: but then that was thunderbird 2 i think so that's probably why :)
[14:24:21] AutomatedTester: its obvious now that I think about it, I was just thinking of the work needed to make it work and was wondering if sending the messages over the wire, and just storing them till perform, and then telling them to perform would be easier
[14:24:34] AutomatedTester: for language implementors
[14:25:31] simonstewart: It's pretty easy to create a stack of Command objects and bundle that across the wire
[14:25:36] negev has joined #selenium
[14:25:45] simonstewart: The problem comes when a user wants to do a read of the DOM
[14:26:07] simonstewart: Or do some additional processing. At that point, we either need to return control to them, or have some way of encoding that calculation
[14:26:09] AutomatedTester: yea
[14:26:13] simonstewart: Which gets very messy, very quickly
[14:26:22] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[14:26:28] AutomatedTester: well thats why i thought have the server collect them till perform
[14:26:58] simonstewart: ?
[14:26:58] AutomatedTester: since when you call perform currently you have to wait till its done anyway
[14:27:11] simonstewart: Ah. For the user interactions?
[14:27:15] AutomatedTester: yea
[14:27:19] simonstewart: Collect client side, then bundle them all over in one hit
[14:27:31] simonstewart: Especially if you're trying to avoid lots of network latency
[14:27:40] simonstewart: It's why the Action has a perform method on it....
[14:27:54] AutomatedTester: I was thinking the bundling could happen server side before thinking of latency
[14:28:04] simonstewart: :)
[14:28:05] AutomatedTester: but client side makes sense from a latency point of view
[14:28:08] simonstewart: Damn slow networks
[14:28:40] Phil___: why doesnt firebug have a normal close button
[14:29:07] Phil___: i keep thinking for a split second my machine will shut down
[14:29:55] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: are you thinking of doing it for a lot of commands?
[14:30:05] AutomatedTester: you or jimevans..

[14:32:57] milligan has joined #selenium
[14:33:10] jimevans: AutomatedTester: let me make clear that i'm *only* interested in batching advanced user interactions, which will enforce at the protocol level what the language binding api already conceptually enforces.

[14:34:51] AutomatedTester: jimevans: it sounds good to me
[14:35:27] jimevans: i certainly see the latency argument for batching arbitrary commands, but that interests me less at the moment.
[14:35:47] simonstewart: Which is why my comment was the way it was.

[14:46:03] avillanueva-npr: I have an issue. I have this following code http://pastebin.com/K1ce8WhK and whenever I call it my test gets hung on the thread.sleep for anything over 500 passed to the sleep function. I would greatly appreciate any help here.
[14:49:09] cgoldberg: avillanueva-npr, you mean if you sleep for 100 millisecs, it works.. but if you sleep > 500 millisecs, it doesn't?
[14:50:41] avillanueva-npr: Yeah, I should be more specific, if I give it less than 500 it'll run but it doesn't run correctly. If I give it 500 or greater it hangs. I know it's the sleep because I've used that instead of the ajaxwait function. Not sure where to go from here. I haven't gotten anything out of debugging either.
[14:51:24] Ardesco: get rid of the thread.sleep would be my answer
[14:51:43] cgoldberg: why do you wanna sleep there anyway?
[14:52:16] avillanueva-npr: I would but my page will rebuild a portion of the DOM and I need for the test to wait before it can keep executing. I need to wait until AJAX is finished specifically.
[14:52:28] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: nicely done, sir

[15:51:39] dude-x: AutomatedTester: do you still want to make it a requirement it's a single code base, or are you okay with 2 separate code paths? as of now, I prefer it to be a separate project because of Google issues and a bit of funkiness with unicode

[15:52:42] AutomatedTester: dude-x: how would I use it if it was 2 separate code paths?

[15:53:13] AutomatedTester: so its not going to be a separate Google Code project
[15:53:55] dude-x: hmm, it could be under a py3 path; but then we will have a lot of duplication
[15:54:05] dude-x: well maybe I'll do more testing around my unified code base
[15:54:19] AutomatedTester: what is the issue of 1 code base?
[15:54:51] dude-x: the use of "from __future__ import unicode literals" may have unintended side effects

[15:57:13] AutomatedTester: dude-x: we can add in code to make virtualenv take a python version parameter
[15:57:16] dude-x: i think it will make the python 2 version buggier using the unicode_literals… but so far tests pass...
[15:57:47] AutomatedTester: what ifs are really hard to guard against

[22:56:37] intchanter-work: lukeis: If there's a problem with the method, he's cited the cases he used.  More cases, or a different interpretation, should be easily achieved by someone with the inclination.
[22:58:52] intchanter-work: lukeis: The point about shooters being stopped without guns doesn't change the obvious point that they would tend to be stopped sooner if the normal people were armed.
[22:59:10] intchanter-work: At least on average.  It's hard to argue it for any individual case.

[22:59:36] dawagner: intchanter-work: Fewer shooters to be stopped >> stopping many shooters sooner

[23:02:50] intchanter-work: I think the gun focus is a distraction at best.
