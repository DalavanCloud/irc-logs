[11:11:53] krosenvold_: OMG
[11:12:20] krosenvold_: dawagner: I just figured it might be nice to have 1 jenkins task that is recpient of the post build hook

[11:12:42] krosenvold_: And I could do the github mirror "elsewhere"
[11:13:08] krosenvold_: I figured it would be a good idea to have 1 task that starts the party on jenkins
[11:14:02] dawagner: That makes sense :) Build All Java would be a sensible one for that, imo

[13:15:35] AutomatedTester: dawagner: is my idea crazy for memoization?
[13:15:53] AutomatedTester: dawagner: well we do dom walking a few times in isShown

[13:47:27] Steven_: hi folks
[13:48:47] Steven_: I have a selenium grid setup with IEDriver
[13:49:07] Steven_: I can fetch pages just fine, but I would like to keep IE open to speed things up
[13:49:18] Steven_: apparently, calling driver.close() will close the window
[13:49:24] Steven_: so will driver.quit()
[13:49:41] Steven_: there seems to be a driver.stop() but I have no idea what that does
[13:50:41] freynaud: close closes the current window, quitting if that' the last. quit quits. Recycling instances is risky because you end up having tests not isolated
[13:51:19] freynaud: my guess is that it's cheaper to add one more node than to try cleaning up the instances manually without quitting

[14:14:41] adamgoucher: it is non-trivially cold out

[14:14:52] Steven_: and the connection is kept open
[14:15:46] freynaud: Steven_: no. The connection is closed. By default hub and node ping each other to detect crash

[14:20:12] Steven_: if they have to reach eachother, that means I can't put my nodes on different isolated networks, e.g. behind a NAT
[14:20:31] freynaud: Steven_: no. It's design against that, so that you can have a node in a VM remaining registered, but in the process of being rebooted for instance.So it's still there as far as the hub is concerned, flagged down.

[14:22:45] AutomatedTester: oh hai simonstewart
[14:23:18] freynaud: Steven_:  no, it's more that the hub is the control centre. That's the best place to keep track of how long or how many test a node has run.
[14:23:27] djonsson has joined #selenium

[14:24:52] Steven_: freynaud: hmm ok :) I'll have to setup a bridging vpn then or something, because in my setup the nodes are not directly connected to the network (since it's windows XP)

[14:52:36] simonstewart: git weirdness
[14:53:06] jimevans: no, it's pretty much user error. i tagged the release without remembering to update the version everywhere, and git discourages overwriting an already pushed tag.
[14:53:26] simonstewart: Yeah. If it's pushed, leave it alone

[15:04:31] djonsson: c:\Program Files\, so I installed Mozilla firefox in this directory and I am still unable to start the driver without actually stating in the code where it is located. However I can start the executable in Windows by entetring: %PROGRAMFILES%\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe

[16:46:59] jimevans: or rather, the thought that went through my head was snarky.
[16:47:09] barancev: re:3652 -- what's out "commit policy" for such situation -- there is no test provided with thte patch, should we wait for a contributor to add a test?

[23:36:21] lukeis: :note dawagner i installed the ssh key myself (muhahahhahahaha, i figured out how I can do anything on your box, you really shouldn't run jenkins as root). One thing though, jenkins creates a local branch (in the form of JobName-JobNumber) and so pushing what it has in the local workspace will not meet our needs for replicating to githubâ€¦ see what i've done for the sites job (it be fugly)
[23:36:21] selbot2: ok!
