[09:38:44] simonstewart: andreastt: you sound happy. 
[09:38:48] simonstewart: (which is good)
[09:39:00] andreastt: Yes, Opera just approved overtime yesterday.
[09:39:11] andreastt: No wait, I should be the opposite!
[09:39:12] simonstewart: Just pushed a change to crazy fun java that actually compiles fragments sensible
[09:39:20] simonstewart: andreastt: woot?
[09:39:38] andreastt: Some manager didn't do his job properly (-;

[09:53:37] simonstewart: That gist: I take it that it's the history of the WebDriver interface?
[09:53:41] krosenvold_: Yup

[09:54:27] simonstewart: Uh
[09:54:29] simonstewart: Me?
[09:54:32] krosenvold_: Yup
[09:54:35] krosenvold_: Nice one that
[09:54:41] simonstewart: Sounds like the cack-handed sort of thing I'd do occasionally
[09:54:59] krosenvold_: Yup. I had to squash thosw 2 commits together
[09:55:22] krosenvold_: c1: "Move everything to new location". c2: "oops. Added missing files"
[09:55:24] krosenvold_: ;)
[09:55:32] simonstewart: lol
[09:56:05] krosenvold_: I started the "push" from my laptop before leaving home this morning, but it seems to have failed somehow
[09:56:10] simonstewart: Ah
[09:56:15] simonstewart: That's suboptimal
[09:56:37] krosenvold_: It will appear at https://github.com/krosenvold/selenium-git-release-candidate real soon ;)
[09:56:44] simonstewart: In a weird way, it'll be nice to get this finished
[09:57:29] simonstewart: It appears to be up to date except for 17 hours ago
[09:57:48] krosenvold_: Hmm. Did the push go through ?
[09:58:05] simonstewart: This is the last commit I see: https://github.com/krosenvold/selenium-git-release-candidate/commit/7e8ab9c9fe4be37bd0d6a0f8dc840fd592e405e6

[09:59:07] simonstewart: In the actual meaning of the word
[09:59:48] krosenvold_: Hmm. I am also cloning but the repo seems to be small
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Jan 11 10:00:01 2013]
[10:00:01] krosenvold_: 59% (136352/229332), 50.47 MiB | 394 KiB/s
[10:00:10] krosenvold_: 59% is *not* 50 mb
[10:00:14] simonstewart: Yeah. I'm seeing something similar
[10:00:18] krosenvold_: Maybe it's a "microsoft progress bar"
[10:00:45] krosenvold_: github needs infinite bandwith
[10:00:46] simonstewart: Once the clone's complete, I'm checking third_party/java
[10:00:59] simonstewart: Don't worry. Google Code has plenty :)
[10:01:13] simonstewart: Hello. It just jumped
[10:01:18] simonstewart: Receiving objects:  61% (140483/229332), 126.78 MiB | 1.25 MiB/s   
[10:01:29] krosenvold_: Hah. I can imagine /that/ bandwidth
[10:01:34] krosenvold_: Or actually, I can't
[10:01:36] simonstewart: Maybe it's counting objects rather than bytes?
[10:01:56] krosenvold_: Didn't I tell you about the whole week I actually spent making a progress bar once ?
[10:02:07] simonstewart: Not yet
[10:02:29] krosenvold_: It's immensely hard sometimes
[10:02:47] krosenvold_: Maybe a talk for seconf ;)
[10:02:52] simonstewart: Heh. 
[10:03:03] simonstewart: I just put forward a talk for GTAC
[10:03:03] krosenvold_: "Progress bars, how hard can they get?"
[10:03:09] suodla has joined #selenium
[10:03:36] simonstewart: Well, it's an unbounded problem: just how long will it take for something to complete
[10:03:37] krosenvold_: It's interesting from a testing perspective too 
[10:03:52] simonstewart: Often the best you can do is to look at past runs and extrapolate
[10:03:54] boge has joined #selenium
[10:03:56] Shakyj has joined #selenium
[10:04:39] krosenvold_: Ok, it's official: The git clone progress bar is a "microsoft progress bar(tm)"
[10:05:00] simonstewart: It's using some weird metric, to be sure
[10:05:17] krosenvold_: 63% (145394/229332)
[10:05:23] simonstewart: I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's not bytes
[10:05:32] simonstewart: Receiving objects:  76% (174870/229332), 438.39 MiB | 1.57 MiB/s 
[10:05:36] krosenvold_: I bet you 145394 is exactly 63% of 229332
[10:05:49] Shakyj: Hey, I'm having issues running selenium on a server, I had "Error: no display specified" so I did "export DISPLAY=:0" and now I am getting "Error: cannot open display: :0"
[10:05:49] simonstewart: Agreed
[10:05:56] simonstewart: I'd love to know what it thinks an "object" is
[10:06:04] krosenvold_: It's an object
[10:06:15] krosenvold_: Regardless of size. Basically an object is a single file
[10:06:19] simonstewart: Shakyj: that implies you have no X running
[10:06:31] simonstewart: File, or part of a file?
[10:06:42] krosenvold_: No it's always a file, but it can also be a directory
[10:06:55] krosenvold_: It's an element in the git trree
[10:06:59] krosenvold_: lunch

[10:07:10] simonstewart: Have fun
[10:07:38] Shakyj: simonstewart: I think it's because I'm on a server which has no X setup or anything like that. But what do I do, just install and start X
[10:07:52] simonstewart: Yeah.
[10:07:59] simonstewart: If it's a server, take a look at using Xvfb
[10:08:03] Shakyj: sweet thanks simonstewart

[10:41:57] Ardesco: i've only got a 1.86Ghz Core 2 Duo with 4GB ram
[10:42:05] simonstewart: Oop. Comparing with the wrong version. Only shaved off 16 seconds
[10:42:10] simonstewart: Still.
[10:42:14] simonstewart: W.T.F?
[10:42:20] Ardesco: 16 seconds is still pretty massive
[10:42:33] simonstewart: Ardesco: why nothing newer? That's a pretty old machine
[10:42:55] Ardesco: just bought a house, new machine is in the backlog
[10:43:19] simonstewart: OK

[10:44:02] simonstewart: Ha!
[10:44:04] simonstewart: Good work
[10:45:12] Ardesco: still having an old machine has it's advantages, you are a hell of a lot more picky about test performance :)

[12:57:05] aero1: I've had this problem for a few days, I've installed selenium from the AUR as well as the standalone server, the server is running, (using python bindings) d=WebDriver(); d.get("http://google.com") and the browser just sits there doing nothing
[12:57:13] aero1: I have this set up on my home machine and it works flawlessly/.
[12:57:28] aero1: any ideas? Logs? 
[12:57:35] aero1: Using the Firefox driver
[12:57:39] aero1: firefox version 18
[12:59:10] mikronaz: selenium 2.28.0 doesnt support FF18 yet
[12:59:41] aero1: mikronaz: strange - it works on my home machine, they're both arch and fully updated
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Jan 11 13:00:45 2013]
[13:00:45] mikronaz: just stating a fact.. ;]
[13:01:12] aero1: mikronaz: and that fact is (so far) demonstrably false
[13:01:36] aero1: If you're familiar with arch then you'll know all versions of all sofware are latest, no matter what... so I for sure have FF18
[13:03:31] mikronaz: anyhow.. latest version of selenium2 doesn't support FF18
[13:03:50] aero1: mikronaz: I read what you put - I'm saying I have FF18 on another machine and it's working
[13:05:15] aero1: mikronaz: does selenium break with every release of a browser?
[13:06:27] jarib: aero1: every release of firefox breaks native components
[13:06:46] aero1: jarib: but should basic things like WebDriver().get("url") work?
[13:07:00] jarib: yes it should
[13:07:11] aero1: jarib: then that doesn't on this machine
[13:07:14] aero1: anywhere I can look?
[13:07:15] jarib: what kind of machine?
[13:07:25] aero1: archlinux, ff18, selenium from the aur
[13:07:32] jarib: what version is in aur?
[13:07:35] aero1: 1 sec
[13:07:50] aero1: 2.28.0-1
[13:08:56] jarib: so it hangs on the get?
[13:09:09] ner0x has joined #selenium
[13:09:20] aero1: jarib: no, it doesn't actually. No blocking, no hanging. Completes the .get() call like nothing happened
[13:09:44] aero1: it opens the browser, but I don't think that's "selenium" code with the python bindings? IIRC it uses subprocess to open the firefox binary
[13:11:12] jarib: aero1: anything in the firefox error console?
[13:11:22] aero1: jarib: where is that console?
[13:11:23] jarib: Tools -> Web Developer -> Error Console

[13:27:35] aero1: AutomatedTester: there's a pretty standard way to get proxy information (on linux/bsd) anyway...
[13:27:55] aero1: $HTTP_PROXY etc env variables will be set if there's a proxy to be used. Does Selenium check for these...
[13:27:59] *aero1 greps source
[13:28:06] jimevans: aero1: I don't know what your issue is. I'm coming in late to the discussion.

[13:36:51] simonstewart: I ain't done nuffin
[13:37:11] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: why is driver.switchTo().activeElement that and not driver.getActiveElement() ?
[13:37:21] AutomatedTester: since it doesnt "switch"
[13:37:22] thekindlyone has joined #selenium
[13:37:40] simonstewart: Honest reason: it read a lot better
[13:38:16] simonstewart: Particularly when explaining things
[13:38:28] simonstewart: So, you want to switch to the active element and then click it
[13:38:37] farlan has joined #selenium
[13:38:37] AutomatedTester: we could do driver.findActiveElement()
[13:38:41] AutomatedTester: instead..
[13:38:44] AutomatedTester: or get
[13:38:54] simonstewart: Or findElement(By.active())
[13:39:00] AutomatedTester: or that

[13:40:07] simonstewart: What made you think of that?
[13:40:07] jimevans: Yuck! I'd much prefer getActive to find(By.active())
[13:40:36] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: because my activeElement patch got r- because of nasty method name on the client code 
[13:40:38] simonstewart: Though "findElement" is more consistent
[13:41:20] simonstewart: Someone at Mozilla didn't like driver.switch_to.active_element but would prefer driver.get.active_element?

[13:55:06] AutomatedTester: outside of QA and Tools
[13:55:22] AutomatedTester: especially after Malini did a marionette talk the other day

[13:56:20] simonstewart: But it'll narrow the window when it can be asked :)
[13:57:07] AutomatedTester: i disagree... Mozilla, like most browser vendors, have a ton of homegrown testing solutions
[13:57:24] AutomatedTester: adding a new one, even if its to get rid of other ones, leads to the why question

[16:19:44] Shakyj: The script I am writing visits my page and clicks the onclick elements as you may have guessed. I am using the proxy to capture redirects from the onclicks but I can't see a good way to split the proxy headers to each onclick event
[16:19:45] intchanter-work has joined #selenium
[16:20:06] simonstewart: "split the proxy headers to each onclick event"?

[16:20:50] Shakyj: in the proxy?
[16:21:00] simonstewart: from the proxy, yeah
[16:21:42] Shakyj: it appends the new headers to the old ones so I end up with a massive list of headers
[16:22:34] simonstewart: IIRC you can flush the headers
[16:22:48] simonstewart: Or use something to diff the lists

[21:17:24] lukeis: krosenvold_: thx, so, how might an individual like myself go about doing a similar process that you have done to create repo for just websites? (i don't care about eons of history, whatever history is there since it was at its current location) could I use git-svn? (I have never used it) or do I need the 'real svn repo' that you had
[21:17:50] krosenvold_: You can use git-svn
[21:17:56] lukeis: cool, i'll give it a go
[21:18:12] krosenvold_: ACtually, I might be able filter it out for you

[21:24:39] krosenvold_: Actually, I'm not sure I have a repo with the sites in it.
[21:25:09] lukeis: np, git-svn is chunking away happily now on my box ;)
[21:25:44] AutomatedTester: I like git-svn
[21:26:10] AutomatedTester: my first task at Mozilla was migrate some repos over
[21:26:14] lukeis: quite easy when i RTFM
[21:26:56] *lukeis should have done this a while ago :-/
[21:28:28] lukeis: now… who is 'in touch' with paul hammant?  I'm going to email him to ask to be added to the seleniumhq github org
[21:29:53] AutomatedTester: lukeis: just mail him
[21:29:58] AutomatedTester: he used to be quite responsive
[21:30:05] lukeis: will do
[21:32:08] AutomatedTester: yay... nearly finished a fucker of a bug fix...

[21:49:07] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: no
[21:49:13] nirvdrum: :-(
[21:49:33] nirvdrum: dawagner's explanation at least made sense.
[21:49:37] AutomatedTester: yea
[21:49:45] nirvdrum: It's long confused me.
[21:50:00] nirvdrum: Sorta like Firefox's countdown when installing an add-on.
[21:50:28] AutomatedTester: thats been removed hasnt it
[21:50:32] AutomatedTester: the count down
[21:51:29] nirvdrum: I haven't tried in 18 yet.  I think it was there in 17.  And you're probably running something even newer than that.
[21:51:31] nirvdrum: So, maybe.
[21:51:37] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: the fucker of a bug is moz#814768
[21:51:40] selbot2_: 03David Burns :automatedtester NEW/ Marionette-actors should be aware of when a frame closes so tests can resume - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=814768
[21:52:09] nirvdrum: Ouch.
[21:53:19] AutomatedTester: I have it "working" but i think its going to leak memory like a sieve
[21:53:41] nirvdrum: I guess that's a nicer problem to have.
[21:54:04] nirvdrum: I already reboot all my test machines hourly because something leaks.
[21:54:39] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: its ok for desktop since rebooting programmatically is ok
[21:54:45] AutomatedTester: on mobile its a bitch
[21:54:49] nirvdrum: Ahh.
[21:55:09] AutomatedTester: and the issue only manifests on FirefoxOS
[21:57:56] nirvdrum: I replaced jQuery UI with ExtJS at 2 AM.  Today I learned how poor some of my tests were :-/

[22:03:34] gdennis has left #selenium
[22:06:43] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: is ExtJS any good
[22:08:27] nirvdrum: I'm loving it so far.
[22:08:47] AutomatedTester: i only used jQuery UI for one thing
[22:08:52] bluescreen100 has joined #selenium
[22:08:52] nirvdrum: It's polished, integrated, and supported.
[22:08:53] AutomatedTester: and still use it
[22:09:02] AutomatedTester: nice
[22:09:20] AutomatedTester: I use it for the Admin section of my blog
[22:09:21] nirvdrum: I had a bunch of different jQuery plugins in various hacked states to support our UI.  And it looked like shit on top of that.
[22:09:39] nirvdrum: The final straw was jQuery UI 1.9 changing the API on a bunch of components.
[22:09:56] nirvdrum: In particular, the tab one.
[22:10:13] nirvdrum: But, yeah, with ExtJS, I can bang out something usually within a day.
[22:10:22] AutomatedTester: awesome
[22:10:27] lukeis: krosenvold_: is there a magic option i missed in order to have the commits link to the github user (like you seem to have done) - https://github.com/lukeis/selenium-websites/commits/master
[22:10:37] AutomatedTester: I dont do any where near enough web dev
[22:10:57] AutomatedTester: but when I do I am starting to get to a stage where I really hate these bloated libraries...
[22:11:00] nirvdrum: As popular as jQuery is, the ecosystem is a mess.
[22:11:30] nirvdrum: Oh, ExtJS is definitely heavy.  But that's a problem I'm much better equipped to handle :-)
[22:12:30] AutomatedTester: someone was talking about zepto the other day
[22:12:35] AutomatedTester: and how great it is
[22:12:39] AutomatedTester: but they dont support IE
[22:12:50] AutomatedTester: so its a jQuery clone that doesnt support IE
[22:12:54] lukeis: oh, the emails got wonky :-/
[22:13:01] AutomatedTester: ?
[22:13:17] lukeis: in my github repo of the websites
[22:13:33] *lukeis talking to myself outloud apparently ;)
[22:13:55] AutomatedTester: i replied
[22:14:45] lukeis: i didn't mean to type out loud ;)
[22:15:46] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I largely despise web developers :-P
[22:16:07] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: i thought you many despise people...
[22:16:10] AutomatedTester: :P
[22:16:21] nirvdrum: One thing is clear: most of the people working on this shit are not fit for the web as a platform.
[22:16:38] lukeis: krosenvold_: do you have an authors file? 
[22:16:44] nirvdrum: As evidenced by my CPU fan that won't shut the fuck off because I one tab someplace pegging my CPU right now.
[22:16:45] lukeis: or anyone else for that matter
[22:17:39] *lukeis found it
[22:18:11] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: the other OSS project I help with made me angry when I realised their site made my browser use 3GB RAM
[22:18:24] nirvdrum: Travis?
[22:18:26] AutomatedTester: yea
[22:18:34] nirvdrum: Lucky guess :-P
[22:18:41] AutomatedTester: its a browser killer
[22:18:42] nirvdrum: I honestly had no idea you worked on Travis.
[22:18:47] nirvdrum: Yeap.
[22:19:03] AutomatedTester: I help them now and again
[22:19:07] nirvdrum: Circular buffers are a great idea.  More people should use them.
[22:19:09] AutomatedTester: in the little free time I have
[22:19:38] AutomatedTester: yea, their next version of the site does that
[22:20:26] AutomatedTester: its much better
[22:21:25] qaguy has left #selenium
[22:22:59] nirvdrum: I've seen.  It's still not great.
[22:32:22] detronizator: lukeis: what's up?
[22:32:58] lukeis: detronizator: just trying to point out the conversation of (really major progress) of moving selenium to git
[22:33:14] detronizator: wow
[22:33:19] detronizator: it's christmas again?
[22:33:24] lukeis: https://github.com/krosenvold/selenium-git-release-candidate
[22:34:31] detronizator: krosenvold_: can I be anal and highlight that the README contains lots of "code sections" and it should be wrapped in triple ```
[22:34:32] detronizator: ?
[22:34:33] detronizator: :)
[22:34:43] detronizator: but feel free to send me to hell
[22:35:27] AutomatedTester: detronizator: fixed the GhostDriver readme yet?
[22:35:32] lukeis: detronizator: patches accepted ;)
[22:36:38] detronizator: AutomatedTester: LOL - yesterday
[22:36:41] detronizator: :P
[22:36:43] lukeis: actually detronizator you have the commit bit ;)
[22:37:12] detronizator: lukeis: krosenvold_: no need to highlight I was a dick - it was on purpose
[22:37:21] detronizator: on the git repo?
[22:37:30] lukeis: we're not on git *yet*
[22:37:46] lukeis: so, further commits to svn are acceptable
[22:39:49] detronizator: lukeis: I'll put myself to work
[22:39:57] detronizator: but this is great news
[22:40:11] detronizator: I can finally browse the souce code without the hideous Google Code ui
[22:40:19] detronizator: that limits the number of directories you can see!!!
[22:40:34] detronizator: I can browse all the way down to the directory where phantomjsdriver jars are
[22:40:35] AutomatedTester: Simon agreed to move off Google Code?
[22:40:37] detronizator: amazing :P
[22:40:41] lukeis: eh, you could do that with github.com/selenium2/selenium2
[22:40:45] lukeis: AutomatedTester: no
[22:41:07] lukeis: but git, being git, can be cloned in github
[22:41:14] detronizator: of course
[22:41:22] detronizator: and if we make it bi-directional
[22:41:31] detronizator: the happines will be maximised
[22:41:32] lukeis: that won't happen
[22:41:40] detronizator: and flowers will come out of my ears
[22:41:47] detronizator: :(
[22:41:52] *detronizator sad
[22:41:54] lukeis: you can do it yourself
[22:42:12] lukeis: but we still need to govern that all commits by users have signed the cla
[22:42:17] detronizator: lukeis: in Italy we have a say about cooking
[22:42:27] detronizator: but it works great with coding (not surprising)
[22:42:38] detronizator: "Il cucinato da altri e' piu' buono"
[22:42:41] detronizator: that means
[22:42:48] detronizator: "What others cook, tastes better"
[22:42:49] AutomatedTester: dont burn the sauce?
[22:43:41] detronizator: AutomatedTester: a bit "stereotypal" are we?
[22:44:06] AutomatedTester: stereotypical?
[22:46:11] detronizator: AutomatedTester: yes, that
[22:46:24] detronizator: :)

[23:25:11] AutomatedTester: smccarthy: they should be built with Java 6
[23:25:59] smccarthy: AutomatedTester: oh ok. thats good news for me. thanks
[23:26:04] *lukeis doesn't have java 7 on his laptop yet and was able to compile with the ones in maven
[23:26:26] AutomatedTester: smccarthy: Selenium needs to support Java 6 as a minimum
[23:28:34] detronizator: smccarthy: they were already Java6, no worries
[23:29:20] smccarthy: detronizator: oh ok cool thx.
