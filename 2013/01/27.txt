[21:50:13] smccarthy: If I start my tests from jenkins, but than jenkins just sends the test to a grid hub, do I need the Xvfb virtual framebuffer? I want to avoid needing it, if possible.
[21:52:03] smccarthy: I tried with Xvfb and it works and without it and seems to fail (but still opens my chrome browser on my grid node, but quits right after that). But since it does open the browser I thought it should work.
