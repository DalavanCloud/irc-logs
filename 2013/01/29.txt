[00:02:17] dude-x: Osleg: simply switch to default content (top frame) and then switch to the iframe you want
[00:02:46] dude-x: sayd: you should probably learn Python. good language and it will make you more marketable, and selenium scripting easier/faster
[00:04:16] sayd: dude-x: yeah ive been perusing python-guide
[00:04:24] sayd: i like these pocoo dudes
[00:05:24] Osleg: dude-x: heh, ok, i surelly didn't explain myself well :) i need to switch to defaul content (the *top* frame) but i can't see how i do it :-\
[00:05:51] Osleg: so/src/rtd - all speak about top frame
[00:06:16] Osleg: but i can't see any kwarg or whatsoever -_-

[00:08:27] Osleg: tnx :)
[00:16:08] sayd: Dude-X_: would i still use that lamda/webdriverwait solution if i knew something wasnt going to be true for at least say, 3 minuts

[10:46:46] barancev: freynaud: hi! as a network expert, can you please take a look at the issue #5089 , the patch seems reasonable
[10:46:47] selbot2: 03 open/new Concurrent Firefox instances open the same port - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=5089 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Status-Untriaged]
[10:51:59] freynaud: barancev: I'm not a FF driver expert, but this patch seems strange to me. If there is an issue with the firefox driver, this should be fixed in the server, not on the C# client
[10:53:59] samphippen has joined #selenium
[10:54:41] barancev: freynaud: it's a browser launcher that uses socket-lock to synchronize concurrent browser startup (that can be performed without server, just several instances of a browser driver)
[10:57:22] freynaud: barancev: if jimevans is happy with it, why not, but if they need to syncronize multi browser, I think they should start the server, rather than start rebuilding in the client some pieces of the server.
[10:58:58] caddoo has joined #selenium
[10:59:39] barancev: freynaud: how do we ensure browser startup synchronization on the server?
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jan 29 11:00:05 2013]
[11:00:05] freynaud: barancev: as far as I know, firefox startups are serialized
[11:00:53] barancev: freynaud: what module serializes them?
[11:01:23] barancev: there should be a synchronization mechanizm somewhere
[11:01:34] freynaud: dawagner: are you familiar with FF internals ?
[11:03:37] simonstewart has joined #selenium
[11:03:38] selbot2: simonstewart: note from dawagner 2 days ago: any idea where to send a patch for https://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/W3C-ED ? /cc AutomatedTester 
[11:04:15] simonstewart: :note dawagner No idea, but hop on to the #testing w3c IRC channel and ask MikeSmith
[11:04:16] selbot2: ok!
[11:05:39] freynaud: barancev: simonstewart might know. Where is the locking mechanism in FF launcher to prevent multiple instance from binding on the same port.
[11:06:26] barancev: simonstewart: yes, can you please take a look at the issue #5089 , the patch is attached
[11:06:27] selbot2: 03 open/new Concurrent Firefox instances open the same port - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=5089 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Status-Untriaged]
[11:07:48] simonstewart: In Java it's used in the NewProfileExtensionConnection
[11:08:09] simonstewart: With the lock being implemented in SocketLock
[11:08:49] barancev: simonstewart: yes, and it seems that we release the lock a bit early
[11:09:13] simonstewart: I don't think so.
[11:09:20] simonstewart: We only release it once the firefox process has started
[11:09:55] Ardesco: heh trolling simonstewart on the web driver user list, #fail
[11:09:56] simonstewart: And we don't leave the block (in Java) until we can connect to the server port started by the browser
[11:10:05] simonstewart: Ardesco: :)
[11:10:06] barancev: yes, and it is not bound to the selected port yet, the port is still free, and the next browser can be assigned to the same port
[11:10:16] simonstewart: Eh?
[11:10:35] simonstewart: The locking port is used as a cross-process/cross-language synch mechanism
[11:10:47] barancev: "browser started" != "http server in the browser started and listening to the specified port"
[11:11:09] simonstewart: which is why we wait until we can connect to the port that the browser should be listening on
[11:11:23] simonstewart: Block starting line 104 in NewProfileExtensionConnection
[11:12:01] simonstewart: We could swap that out for the PortProber now
[11:12:24] simonstewart: But that code was written before the Prober existe
[11:12:25] simonstewart: d
[11:13:35] barancev: I see, you're looking in Java code, the issue is about .Net :)
[11:13:48] simonstewart: Oh. Well that might not be implemented the same way
[11:13:59] barancev: yes, Java binding looks correct
[11:14:14] simonstewart: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriverInternals
[11:14:30] simonstewart: Has the algorithm for port locking in the Flow of Control section
[11:14:34] barancev: Java unlocks when connection establised, .Net  does not
[11:14:44] barancev: ok, thanks!
[11:18:15] dawagner: freynaud: Firefox itself? I've poked in a few times, but I avoid it like the plague? Why?
[11:18:16] selbot2: dawagner: note from simonstewart 14 minutes ago: No idea, but hop on to the #testing w3c IRC channel and ask MikeSmith 
[11:18:37] freynaud: dawagner: simonstewart just replied actually 
[11:18:45] dawagner: aha

[11:19:48] simonstewart: I've no time right now
[11:29:26] barancev: wtf again these intermittent sauce issues
[11:29:48] simonstewart: If only we knew someone who worked there....
[11:29:56] barancev: dawagner: too much parallel jobs may be?
[11:30:51] simonstewart: There are a handful of tests for Firefox 18 native that are taking well over a minute
[11:30:59] simonstewart: Some of the others are just short of it
[11:31:03] simonstewart: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Firefox%2018%20XP%20Native%20Java%20Tests/552/testReport/org.openqa.selenium/
[11:31:22] simonstewart: That seems surprisingly long
[11:32:54] barancev: simonstewart: time dependes primarily on the number of test methods in each test class
[11:32:54] krosenvold_: simonstewart: Can you see the url for the old svn repo  at google code ? I'd like to check something
[11:33:15] barancev: except for tests for windows and alerts that are slow by the nature
[11:33:21] simonstewart: krosenvold_: you can use svn commands against the old repo path
[11:33:31] krosenvold_: And that was ;)
[11:34:02] krosenvold_: Ah, it was in the pom
[11:34:35] simonstewart: https://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

[12:12:03] millenium has joined #selenium
[12:13:23] jimevans: 'day everybody.
[12:14:45] barancev: muay-guy: you have to ask your product owner / test manager how should you test :) and then you can ask us how to implement the actions you need performing to complete the test
[12:17:01] muay-guy: barancev: :\ I'm just writing a web-scraper to get some metadata out of a page which uses this feature. I don't have a product owner/test manager. What I need to do is make sure that I'm executing driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);") until no more data is being loaded

[12:20:27] muay-guy: millenium: yeah, me either but the html is generated through js, so I can't just use urllib or something like that
[12:20:48] barancev: muay-guy: e.g. check the number of items in the list, if it increases you should contunue scrolling

[13:44:34] simonstewart: jimevans: I'm not hugely surprised. Which ones?
[13:44:56] jimevans: finding an element. by name is the only one i've tried so far.
[13:44:57] simonstewart: (Anything going through IE's JS engine is a world of pain)
[13:45:11] simonstewart: That's pretty easy to do
[13:45:15] simonstewart: Sorry
[13:45:17] simonstewart: Rephrase
[13:45:22] jimevans: yeah, but i didn't expect it to be *quite* this bad on 32-bit IE9
[13:45:47] simonstewart: There are cases where it'd be easy to pull out the functionality to COM calls without worrying about functionality not being equivalent
[13:46:04] jimevans: simonstewart: i think you're right there.
[13:46:19] simonstewart: Finding by name (and id, for that matter) are obvious candidates
[13:46:23] elstif has joined #selenium
[13:46:44] barancev: as soon as driver dvelopment will be pushed to the vendors only test can ensure "functional equivalence"
[13:46:46] jimevans: id is tricky in the multiple elements case.
[13:46:48] simonstewart: CSS might also be okay, but catching the malformed selectors might be tricky
[13:46:51] barancev: tests
[13:47:06] simonstewart: Well, findElement and findElements are different calls....
[13:47:19] jimevans: barancev: driver development being pushed to MSFT for IE is a very, very long way away.
[13:47:22] simonstewart: barancev: agreed. That's why we flesh out our test suite as much as we can
[13:47:42] simonstewart: Every corner case we can write a test for is another promise of compat between implementations

[15:23:38] AutomatedTester: jimevans: my team has realised that batching actions is A Good Thing (tm)
[15:24:02] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i rather thought so myself.
[15:24:31] AutomatedTester: jimevans: pesky mobile has flaky connections so batching makes sense :)
[15:27:27] jimevans: :spec
[15:27:27] selbot2: http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html | http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/
[15:29:00] jimevans: AutomatedTester: so in section 14 of the spec, perhaps we should call that out
[15:29:26] *jimevans still needs to change the json wire protocol and implement the batching for actions

[15:40:16] simonstewart: I'm glad that people are catching up with the idea of batching
[15:40:56] simonstewart: I suspect that the mobile use case will want even more batching than just actions
[15:43:56] stan has joined #selenium
[15:44:59] simonstewart: Sorry. Moment of smugness there.
[15:45:01] simonstewart: Over it now
[15:45:05] simonstewart: For now :)
[15:45:18] jimevans: i suspect you're right, but in my narrow world view, all i care about batching is actions at the moment. :)
[15:45:31] simonstewart: I know.

[15:47:44] jimevans: it occurs to me that batching arbitrary commands would be easier with a single endpoint instead of the multiple http endpoints we have today.
[15:48:16] jimevans: but that still leaves you with the "what if something within the batch fails" problem
[15:49:11] *jimevans just isn't smart enough to figure all this stuff out.
[15:49:39] simonstewart: The list of batched commands would definitely end up going to a single end point
[15:49:49] simonstewart: cos there's no other sane way of doing things in a single command
[15:50:53] simonstewart: Once I've figured out the best way to allow a wait to be shunted across the wire, I'll be happier
[15:51:37] _kW has joined #selenium
[15:52:05] jimevans: simonstewart: i recognize the need, but that to me sounds really dangerous. 
[15:52:17] simonstewart: In what way?
[15:52:54] jimevans: we already have trouble keeping people from using arbitrary sleeps. you'll have to be careful not to expose that to the user.
[15:53:31] simonstewart: What I mean is that one of the major use cases is pushing the "wait until this expected condition is completed" closer to the browser
[15:53:54] simonstewart: Calling something like that in a tight loop with network latency in the way seems like a recipe for a Whole World Of Pain

[15:57:59] smccarthy has joined #selenium
[15:58:59] simonstewart: I periodically think about these things on my commute home. Might put some brain power in now too
[15:59:25] simonstewart: The closest I came was allowing people to register new commands that appear read-only on the server
[15:59:33] simonstewart: But that's not really viable for someone like Sauce
[15:59:43] simonstewart: So I've discarded that
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jan 29 16:00:14 2013]
[16:00:14] simonstewart: Another approach is to specify a body of "stuff to do" as WebDriverJS and shunt that across
[16:00:24] simonstewart: But it's less than natural
[16:00:38] simonstewart: I think some acknowledgement that you're batching commands will be necessary
[16:03:08] intchanter-work has joined #selenium
[16:03:59] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: we were talking about batching more
[16:04:10] simonstewart: See! See!
[16:04:21] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: but what I would like to avoid batching the same as mozmill
[16:04:28] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: right
[16:04:37] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: which puts everything on the browser and then waits
[16:04:45] simonstewart: Which is a little too much
[16:04:53] simonstewart: I'm thinking of some sort of API like:
[16:05:34] simonstewart: RecordingWebDriver recording = new RecordActions(driver); /* perform actions with recording */; recording.playback()
[16:05:37] simonstewart: or something like that
[16:05:45] simonstewart: but that's not right
[16:05:54] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: re: Touch vs Pointer - "We hope that Pointer Events will replace Touch Events in the future, but for now only Touch Events are implemented in Gecko. Additionally, most existing web content uses Touch Events.  So we will need to continue supporting Touch Events for the forseeable future. "
[16:06:01] simonstewart: As you can't easily use waits
[16:06:12] AutomatedTester: from the editor of Touch Events
[16:06:20] simonstewart: OK. So we use the names from Pointer Events
[16:06:24] simonstewart: Seems pretty clear to me
[16:06:50] AutomatedTester: hmmm...
[16:06:55] AutomatedTester: I think we use both
[16:06:56] jimevans: simonstewart: sounds like you want to standardize WebDriverWait, and a number of ExpectedConditions as part of the spec/protocol.
[16:07:02] simonstewart: Right now, we probably do.
[16:07:05] AutomatedTester: since there will be mapping between the two soon
[16:07:12] simonstewart: jimevans: I want to avoid that :)
[16:07:25] simonstewart: we might have a -sel set of custom commands, but that's a last resort

[17:07:21] jibay has joined #selenium
[17:08:10] jimevans: regex__: great. don't forget to apply similar fixes to the one you used for Textfield. that is, everywhere in Controllers where you have "public new IWebElement objectName { get; set; }", you'll need to get rid of it.
[17:08:41] jimevans: a general rule of thumb is that you should almost never need to use the "new" keyword in a field, property, or method declaration.
[17:09:10] jimevans: (inside the body of a property or method, yes, all the time, but almost never in a declaration)
[17:10:08] regex__: jimevans: Why are you against new in a field, property, or method declaration? 
[17:10:45] jimevans: because it breaks inheritance, and leads to exactly the problems we were debugging yesterday. it "hides" the member of the base class with the same name.
[17:11:31] jimevans: if you don't have the new keyword in the declaration, the compiler even warns you about it.
[17:13:17] regex__: jimevans: Screw the compiler

[17:22:06] jimevans: regex__: there are some really good tools that you can use to help make sure you're following "best practices" with .NET code. first is FxCop, which comes with VS2010 premium or ultimate. you can find more information on it at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264939%28v=vs.100%29.aspx
[17:22:47] jimevans: another good tool is StyleCop, which concerns itself with coding style rather than content. you can find it at http://stylecop.codeplex.com.
[17:24:01] jimevans: for what it's worth, the .NET bindings code is routinely run through both tools to make sure that good coding practices and a common coding style are followed.

[18:40:13] sayd: will WebDriverWait work when something is going to happen in the future? like say a cron job changes something from scheduled->published, but the page wouldn't change unless there was a refresh. will wdw catch that?
[18:41:18] tsukasa_: lukeis any ideas?
[18:41:46] sayd: basically right now i am successfully checking that a post was created and its in scheduled form. i schedule it for 3 minutes from now.. would i use a long wait timeout in webdriverwait? or somethign like time.sleep because i know its going to take that long
[18:42:50] dude-x: a sleep would probably be better so that it overwaits
[18:42:53] dude-x: :p
[18:46:42] lukeis: tsukasa_: if one of your asserts fail, the try/except block around the entire thing swallows up the error and quits the browser, you never print out the error in any way
[18:47:25] tsukasa_: lukeis true but it prints out "here" before it quits, and the browser doesn't load the other page
[18:47:34] tsukasa_: i can take it out of the block to see if the error is anything useful though
[18:48:36] lukeis: well, if you're only doing one command, selenium can often interact with a page before you even see it, so the browser loads the DOM, you get the text and issue the quit before the rendering fully appears

[22:25:04] santiycr: oh, that'd be handy

[22:25:40] Swadq has joined #selenium

[22:26:49] santiycr: I see
[22:27:00] santiycr: how do I make Selenium not start iedriver for me?
[22:27:17] farlan has joined #selenium
[22:27:17] *santiycr is currently reading iedriver wiki
[22:27:19] jimevans: most of the language bindings support passing these parameters through the "service" class
[22:27:39] jimevans: i don't know if the wiki will help. i've been really bad about keeping it updated.
[22:28:27] santiycr: so, via RemoteDriver, I'm guessing there's a capability I can set
[22:28:46] jimevans: actually, i don't know about that.
[22:28:50] santiycr: though I don't see it here: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities#IE_specific
[22:29:20] jimevans: you can't set the values through capabilities on InternetExplorerDriver, because at that point the server's already started.
[22:30:24] jimevans: and you'd need someone who knows the java bindings better than i do to figure out whether those things can be passed to the IEDriverServer's command line.
[22:30:38] sayd: how would i use relative paths in my python wd tests?
[22:31:03] santiycr: jimevans:  that's fine, sauce can mangle with the json body sent before we pass it to the selenium jar
[22:31:47] jimevans: sure, but again, i don't know if those can be passed to the command line via capabilities in the java bindings.
[22:32:04] santiycr: we wouldn't even ask users to set such thing, then we'd pass something like "iedriver.commandLineSwitches": ["—log-level", "debug", "—log-file", "/path/to/file"]
[22:32:09] santiycr: I see
[22:32:40] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[22:32:52] jimevans: i just don't know if the java bindings provide anything like that.
[22:33:16] jimevans: (i certainly didn't build it into the java bindings)
[22:33:40] santiycr: if the server jar can take something like that, it would be enough for us
[22:34:02] santiycr: I'm guessing users at some point will want to be able to modify these switches somehow
[22:35:28] santiycr: what's your recommended workflow for any user willing to run iedriverserver with modified command line args?
[22:38:10] jimevans: santiycr: given that they only really work locally, I'd create a custom InternetExplorerDriverService class (java and .NET both have such a class, Ruby too, i think), setting the appropriate settings on that class, and using it in the InternetExplorerDriver constructor.
[22:39:55] santiycr: I see opera can take the following caps: opera.logging.file, opera.logging.level
[22:40:07] santiycr: jimevans:  how do you feel about me implementing such thing for iedriver
[22:40:26] jimevans: santiycr: in the java bindings? knock yourself out! :)
[22:41:12] santiycr: I only need the server jar to handle them
[22:41:50] santiycr: I don't think bindings need to do too much work to use the caps
[22:42:07] santiycr: just set the custom key value 
[22:42:20] jimevans: well, in the server jar, then. wherever the case may be.
[22:43:39] santiycr: yeah, it would be in java land, gotta figure out where that code resides

[23:47:31] sayd: is that switch_to_alert feature version-specific? It runs locally but not on my jenkins machine 
[23:50:17] sayd: would i run a step like this in a WebDriverWait call? wd.find_element_by_id("edit-delete").click()
[23:50:33] sayd: if it required the page to be fully loaded 
[23:52:06] lukeis: no, that does not look right, you shouldn't be clicking in a wait.until call
[23:52:23] sayd: ok
[23:52:24] lukeis: unless you *really* *really* know what you're doing ;)
[23:52:27] sayd: no
[23:52:58] sayd: im just trying to narrow down why this would work locally but not on another machine
[23:53:26] lukeis: usually comes down to timing, one machine is performing faster (read slower) than the other
[23:53:49] sayd: it never seems to run that click() code
[23:54:23] lukeis: same OS, same version of Selenium, same browser version? :)
[23:54:51] mario-go` has joined #selenium
[23:54:53] sayd: lukeis: definitely the latter 2 yes
[23:55:11] sayd: but it might be mountain lion vs lion.. i wouldnt think tha would cause such a low level failure tho
[23:55:31] lukeis: doubt there to be an issue between those two OS's
[23:56:01] lukeis: more likely a mac / windows / linux difference than versions of the same kind
[23:56:07] sayd: actually scratch that they are both 10.8.2
[23:56:16] lukeis: so, likely a timing issue
