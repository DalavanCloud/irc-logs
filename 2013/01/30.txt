[00:06:28] sayd: maybe missing a wait for page? I dunno.. almost out of idea
[00:06:43] sayd: i see it load the page, but it never does anyhing after that
[00:07:29] sayd: it seems to raelly not like the fact the dialog is present
[00:07:53] sayd: i do the switch_to_alert after the click which causes it. thats ok right?
[00:09:09] dude-x: you have to switch to alert and either dismiss or accept it
[00:09:46] davehunt has joined #selenium
[00:10:27] sayd: yeah i am accepting
[00:10:45] sayd: basically find_element().click() # causes popup -- i never see the popup
[00:10:56] llaskin: is it in the background?
[00:10:57] dude-x: sayd, with python you can open the python interpreter
[00:11:02] sayd: right after that in code : switch_to_alert().accept
[00:11:02] llaskin: what if you manually run it with the interpreter?
[00:11:09] dude-x: and just interact with the page live!
[00:11:19] sayd: llaskin: dude-x i see it when i run locally
[00:11:31] sayd: but just not when jenkins runs it on a remote machine
[00:11:51] llaskin: are you vnc'd into the machine to make sure it appears or doesn't?
[00:12:00] dude-x: yeah jenkins can be tricky sometimes
[00:12:40] sayd: llaskin: uyeap
[00:13:13] llaskin: hrm
[00:13:16] llaskin: unsure
[00:13:21] llaskin: perhaps you need an explicit wait?
[00:13:25] llaskin: or an implicit one
[00:15:54] sayd: lets see.. 
[00:16:01] sayd: 40th time the charm?
[00:22:22] sayd: nop.. timing didnt seem to help, i put a time.sleep.. the thing just seems to crap out
[00:22:29] admc1 has joined #selenium
[00:24:28] dude-x: you might need to wait for the alert to appear too
[00:31:02] sayd: no dice
[00:31:31] sayd: its like this thing knows how long ive worked on it and it just refuses to finish that last 0.9%
[00:32:12] sayd: as soon as i manually click the button and i see the dialog, it disappears with the Modal error
[00:34:01] phishy has joined #selenium
[00:39:17] sayd: https://gist.github.com/8d3f63356634e802a53b that .click on line 3 is the one that should cause the modal
[00:39:33] sayd: this is after i manually click it.. so i think that line may be taking longer than it should?
[00:40:01] sayd: llaskin: would i just paste in the file to the interpeter to run this thing interactively?
[00:41:49] llaskin: basically
[00:48:06] llaskin: i don't know python
[00:48:10] llaskin: so i assume that is how you do it.
[00:52:27] DK2 has joined #selenium
[00:53:19] KaibutsuX: has anyone looked into any memory leaks with webdriver's python bindings?
[00:57:37] sayd: llaskin: just ran through it manually on that machine and it worked ok

[01:12:44] sayd: idea. my implicit_wait at the top of hte page is less than the time i sleep in my script :?
[01:13:09] sayd: maybe if i increase the implicit wait things will behave
[01:14:47] sayd: although that still wouldnt explain why things run locally ok

[02:23:51] sayd: is there somethign i can do before a click() to verify things are ok?
[02:24:03] sayd: i am never seeing this click happen on a certain machine
[02:25:10] Dude-X_: sayd, is this certain machine slower?
[02:25:11] Dude-X_: faster?
[02:26:09] sayd: Dude-X_: faster
[02:26:51] sayd: i can show you the script if you want to see
[02:26:58] Dude-X_: ok
[02:27:59] sayd: Dude-X_: https://gist.github.com/127ee1f03bb919dd0d62 see line 66
[02:29:22] sayd: 63 loads a new page, and i think anythign after that doesnt run
[02:31:01] Dude-X_: 63 loads a new page?
[02:31:16] Dude-X_: then 65 might need time to finish loading other elements
[02:31:39] sayd: Dude-X_: yeah
[02:31:53] Dude-X_: what browser do you run tests against?
[02:32:02] sayd: i just put a print 64 will see if it gets there
[02:32:09] sayd: Dude-X_: firefox
[02:32:14] Dude-X_: okay great
[02:32:19] Dude-X_: do you know how to use Firebug?
[02:32:25] sayd: yup
[02:33:54] jarray52 has joined #selenium
[02:34:15] sayd: what do you want me to do with fb?
[02:34:30] Dude-X_: there's a Firebug extension called "FireDiff"
[02:34:44] Dude-X_: it shows up as a Changes on the tab
[02:35:35] jarray52: I'm using the ruby bindings for selenium, and the rails server "loses" the csrf certificates and the session information. Any suggestions?
[02:35:54] Dude-X_: sayd, firediff can show you all the dom changes
[02:36:06] sayd: Dude-X_: ok
[02:37:08] Dude-X_: so when you click that button, see what changes are being made to the DOM as the page loads
[02:37:18] Dude-X_: then you wait for that element to appear first before you click the next button
[02:37:23] sayd: Dude-X_: it seems like wd creates a new profile every time?
[02:37:40] sayd: i just installed fb and when the test restarted it was gone
[02:38:03] Dude-X_: oh yeah web driver starts a profile that is tailored for best use with webdriver
[02:38:06] Dude-X_: it disables a lot of things
[02:38:12] Dude-X_: do it separate from webdriver
[02:38:30] sayd: it works fine if i manually click the button
[02:38:48] sayd: but i will give it a shot
[02:38:53] Dude-X_: web driver by default will click on buttons via javascript, not by using an OS event
[02:38:55] sayd: see what firediff tells me
[02:40:10] jarray52: Also, when I carry out the same sequence of events manually, rails does not "lose" the csrf certificate and session information.
[02:40:57] Dude-X_: jarray52, why do you think it's a rails issue versus webdriver?
[02:42:54] jarray52: Dude-X_: I don't know whether it is a rails issue or a webdriver issue. In fact, it is most likely a user error.
[02:42:55] markalanevans has joined #selenium
[02:44:03] sayd: Dude-X_: nothing showing up on changes
[02:44:18] jarray52: Dude-X_: However, when I enter the same sequence of events manually, the csrf certificate and session information is not lost. Thus, I wonder if the problem is due to the way in which the information is entered by webdriver.
[02:44:20] Dude-X_: jarray52, i don't have much experience with rails or Certs but it can be a pain when not using Firefox
[02:44:41] jarray52: Dude-X_: I have the problem with both firefox and chrome.
[02:44:55] Dude-X_: jarray52, web driver by default will use javascript to click on things, so it might bypass a few triggers
[02:45:34] jarray52: Dude-X_: triggers?
[02:45:43] Dude-X_: javascript triggers
[02:45:45] Dude-X_: or CSS
[02:46:52] jarray52: Dude-X_: Do you mean javascript/jquery bindings?
[02:46:52] sayd: cool prog, but it didnt help
[02:47:24] jarray52: Dude-X_: or triggering events?
[02:47:57] Dude-X_: jarray52, javacsript, it doesn't matter the library
[02:49:06] sayd: Dude-X_: this is the err when i manually do the click whil the test is running https://gist.github.com/127ee1f03bb919dd0d62#comment-760857
[02:49:09] jarray52: Dude-X_: ahh... google says things like id, class, etc.
[02:49:38] jarray52: Dude-X_: Yes. I'm using triggers to specify events.
[02:50:10] Dude-X_: sayd, oh it's an alert dialog box that's not being properly closed!
[02:50:55] sayd: opened, right? i never see it .. unless i click that button manually
[02:51:13] fatguylaughing has joined #selenium
[02:51:44] sayd: basically im scripting delete button, and its not popping up when i click() the element that triggers it via script. but just on this one machine
[02:52:03] sayd: maybe the js isnt loaded yet but i tried putting in a time.sleep b4 the click
[02:52:10] Dude-X_: probably there is a timing difference
[02:52:18] sayd: and this is a faster machine i am running it on where it fails
[02:52:39] Dude-X_: web driver has a expected conditions that has a wait for alert 
[02:52:48] Dude-X_: it might be useful to use that function
[02:53:19] jarray52: Dude-X_: I used wait events. In addition, I tried inserting long sleep statements between each step.
[02:53:36] Dude-X_: and you still get issues?
[02:53:46] sayd: Dude-X_: switch_to_alert?
[02:53:54] jarray52: Dude-X_: Yes. I still have issues.

[07:36:59] sayd: barancev: i tried 
[07:38:16] sayd: if i had to do other stuff like refresh the page for that check.. would i use the condition in a function?
[07:40:06] barancev: please rephrase the question. which condition in which function?
[07:41:00] sayd: i think i would need to use a presence_of_element_located after a page refresh
[07:42:02] barancev: in this case you need to implement your own condition to wait for
[07:42:09] sayd: or maybe a element_located_to_be_selected and i would need to refresh the page until it was true
[07:43:11] barancev: use element_to_be_clickable (or element_located_to_be_selected) as a draft and implement your own
[07:43:52] sayd: what would that look like inside a webdriver wait?
[07:46:17] barancev: sayd: btw, on the new site this bug is already fixed: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp

[09:33:26] Steven_: and I would like to use these in parallel
[09:34:10] Steven_: afaik, each browser is controlled by a single test
[09:34:20] Steven_: or rather
[09:34:27] Steven_: each test runs in its own thread or process
[09:34:35] Steven_: which means 100 processes or 100 threads
[09:34:57] Steven_: under the hood, each test just opens a connection to the hub, and waits for a response
[09:35:17] Steven_: is it possible to create an asynchronous sessions?
[09:35:36] Steven_: that way I can have 1 process opening 100 connections to the hub
[09:35:48] Steven_: instead of 100 processes each opening 1 connection to the hub

[16:04:33] andreastt: Sounds like some other project I've worked on.
[16:04:42] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: You couldn't handle an incremented simonstewart

[16:04:58] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: I can handle worse...
[16:05:12] andreastt: Don't overflow him…
[16:05:14] simonstewart: Oh well. That's the thing that's been stopping me from levelling up

[16:10:06] simonstewart: But nowhere to store my bike
[16:10:25] *AutomatedTester walks to work too
[16:10:32] RossPatterson: Having showers at work and a cycling-friendly employer helps.

[16:11:17] RossPatterson: Must.  Not.  Type.  What.  Comes.  Too.  Mind.
[16:11:50] RossPatterson: AutomatedTester: You're also in the only real city on that tiny little island off the coast of France?
[16:12:44] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: by city you mean town and by town you mean small village right and by tiny island you mean near the Isle of Wight right?
[16:13:17] RossPatterson: Yeah, right.  That's where Picadilly Circus and Marble Arch are, right?
[16:13:30] AutomatedTester: no

[16:17:13] AutomatedTester: I can be
[16:17:58] AutomatedTester: d-day is 3 weeks 
[16:18:07] AutomatedTester: so next week is probably my last chance...
[16:19:19] RossPatterson: That's why I thought you were a mainlander - so many "meet you at the pub"s.

[17:07:17] AutomatedTester: amongst a million other things ;)
[17:07:23] detronizator: Ardesco: anyway, I do think the driver should come inside the browser. Maybe even within the same exe
[17:07:24] bfife: im seeing a pattern
[17:07:37] Ardesco: It would make it easier to be fair
[17:07:43] detronizator: AutomatedTester: you think it would be too much inside the same app?
[17:08:05] medwards: AutomatedTester: if you'll be around in 30 I'll shoot you a bug.
[17:08:19] AutomatedTester: medwards: I'll be having supper with the family 
[17:08:22] bfife: AutomatedTester: maybe they should just build an api into all browsers. :P
[17:08:26] AutomatedTester: medwards: but i'll be online
[17:08:40] andreastt: detronizator: Security implications, device implications, and organizational implications are some of the things that come to mind.
[17:08:41] AutomatedTester: detronizator: Marionette doesnt require a separate download
[17:08:48] AutomatedTester: detronizator: there will be one but it wont be needed
[17:08:57] Ardesco: bfife: you mean something that used the WebDriver API inside the browser
[17:09:02] Ardesco: that would be cool
[17:09:14] Ardesco: you could think of it as some sort of puppet driving a browser
[17:09:20] AutomatedTester: detronizator: it will be behind a number of flags so it wont be easy to just turn it on
[17:09:26] Ardesco: but since puppet is already a thing you would have to think of a different name
[17:09:29] Ardesco: how about marionette
[17:09:32] AutomatedTester: you will need to launch the browser telling it to work with marionette
[17:09:34] andreastt: Ardesco: That's already technically possible.
[17:09:35] Ardesco: give it a fresh feel
[17:09:37] Ardesco: ;)

[17:11:13] AutomatedTester: detronizator: so if you have the flags, and the profile is in the correct shape it will start marionette listening
[17:11:27] AutomatedTester: and then you speak straight to the browser
[17:12:32] andreastt: AutomatedTester: With Marionette, how do you solve connecting to it on Android?
[17:12:37] detronizator: AutomatedTester: so, exactly like PhantomJS does now :)
[17:12:46] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Or devices in general.
[17:12:51] *detronizator thinks Mozilla copied us :P
[17:13:13] AutomatedTester: andreastt: we use the remote debugger
[17:13:17] AutomatedTester: in Gecko
[17:13:28] AutomatedTester: so we use adb to forward traffic to the port
[17:14:01] andreastt: Yes, but Marionette will presumably open a port on the device.  The ADB doesn't allow you to forward and expose a port on the device to the outside world.
[17:15:07] AutomatedTester: andreastt: by outside world do mean the device speaking to the local machine its attached?
[17:15:28] andreastt: Yes, to the host.
[17:15:35] AutomatedTester: andreastt: adb forward tcp:2828 tcp:2828 will forward all localhost:2828 traffic to the device
[17:15:43] AutomatedTester: on the same port
[17:15:47] andreastt: Last I checked ADB allows you to open ports _from_ the host to the device, but not the other way around?
[17:16:35] AutomatedTester: we dont do it from device to host
[17:16:39] AutomatedTester: we do from host to device

[17:25:36] lukeis: plightbo_work: congrats on the iOS release, did you guys do any automated testing for it? (if so, what did you end up using?)
[17:25:48] andreastt: I had to implement a reverse proxy for OperaDriver to work on actual devices, since Opera requires the user to initiate the Scope connection.

[17:28:35] lukeis: one side project is ending, this will be my next one
[17:29:06] lukeis: so, appthwack, i'm not seeing how they actually do the testing? I see many devices ;)
[17:30:08] lukeis: random usage stress testing? looking for exceptions / errors?
[17:30:08] plightbo_work: they just provide the platform
[17:30:13] plightbo_work: you would use something like appium on it

[17:52:36] jimevans: anix: two things for .NET users. first, make sure you're using DesiredCapabilities.HtmlUnitWithJavaScript(). second, don't use HtmlUnit from .NET, use PhantomJSDriver instead.
[17:53:02] lukeis: anix: i saw that if you are trying to run the device build app in the simulator or the simulator build app in the device ;)

[17:54:51] sayd has joined #selenium
[17:55:01] jimevans: anix: i assume you're trying to use HtmlUnit because you want so-called "headless" testing (however specious the argument that it's actually worth doing that). phantomjs is a much better fit with .net than htmlunit.
[17:55:17] simonstewart: lukeis: no
[17:55:26] lukeis: simonstewart: i'm getting that ;)

[18:29:13] barancev: lukeis: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp python samples in Expected Conditions section
[18:30:28] barancev: sayd: then "from selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions import *" should import all classes from the module, right?
[18:30:54] simonstewart: barancev: this is a question about how to add new expected conditions

[18:31:55] lukeis: to create ones own, they could look at the ExpectedConditions file for examples
[18:32:15] lukeis: no need to extend or implement anything in python (unlike java)
[18:32:19] barancev: lukeis: according to the apidocs there is no ExpectedConditions class in selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions module, each condition is a class, not a methid in ExpectedConditions class

[20:47:50] jimevans: oh? how so?
[20:48:14] AutomatedTester: touch screens allow multiple independent actions to happen
[20:48:48] AutomatedTester: e.g. on google maps press one finger, rotate with another...
[20:49:17] jimevans: ok, i follow you so far.
[20:49:55] AutomatedTester: so each finger will become its own action chain
[20:50:33] AutomatedTester: so you need a action chain of action chains to build up things
[20:50:38] AutomatedTester: then send them over
[20:51:14] AutomatedTester: and then the remote end needs to see the different queues and try action them simultaneously
[20:51:35] AutomatedTester: does that make any sense?
[20:51:46] jimevans: or the touch implementation needs to be aware of being able to do "press" multiple times representing multiple fingers.
[20:52:06] AutomatedTester: right but you can do more than just "press"
[20:52:49] jimevans: right, i guess the touch events need a "finger index" piece that would indicate "this set of actions belongs to this finger"
[20:53:33] AutomatedTester: yea
[20:53:44] AutomatedTester: but thought you would be interested
[20:53:50] jimevans: oh, i am.

[21:23:26] barancev: santiycr: what can/should we do on our side to avoid "Browser failed to start" failures like this: https://saucelabs.com/tests/5ac421750f314f3c9907ae391ef2cf63
[21:24:34] sayd: incredibly frustrating this is taking so long to get working
[21:25:28] sayd: i cant get it to detect that is_selected() thing (returned from scheduled_post_published)

[21:27:08] dude-x: 58 should take a driver object not object
[21:27:12] dude-x: change object to 'driver'
[21:28:12] sayd: dude-x: I ended up just renaming the driver inside that function to wd
[21:28:18] intchanter-work has joined #selenium
[21:28:20] sayd: but good to know that it takes a driver as the arg
[21:28:34] dude-x: webdriver wait will always pass the driver object into the function you pass it to
[21:29:02] dude-x: sometimes you don't need it, so i'd write "def function(ignored)
[21:29:09] sayd: it still doesnt explain why that timeout exception is being thrown
[21:29:17] dude-x: because it's never selected....
[21:29:28] dude-x: or it's still not finding the element after 100 seconds

[21:30:20] intchanter-work has joined #selenium
[21:30:43] sayd: i put the webdriver wait inside that function after the page refresh
[21:30:54] sayd: since the page might take a bit to laod
[21:31:55] dude-x: looking at your code i bet it takes longer than 100 seconds
[21:32:04] dude-x: probably closer to 150 seconds
[21:32:18] sayd: if you refresh the gist you will see
[21:33:16] dude-x: don't do that
[21:33:24] dude-x: it will wait a superlong time
[21:33:45] dude-x: leave it as element = driver.find_element_by_xpath('..')
[21:33:51] sayd: basically i was reloading every 20 s
[21:34:00] dude-x: i see that
[21:34:19] dude-x: but i think it's taking longer than that because it will attempt about 5 times
[21:34:32] dude-x: and each attempt is 10 seconds long
[21:34:52] sayd: ok trying
[21:35:01] dude-x: have you tried testing this in the python interpreter
[21:35:08] sayd: gist updated
[21:35:25] dude-x: you can open python; type "from selenium import webdriver; wd = webdriver.Firefox()
[21:35:31] dude-x: then just naviage to the page
[21:35:39] dude-x: and then click on stuff
[21:35:56] dude-x: then type in commands in the python interpreter like "wd.find_element()"
[21:36:32] AutomatedTester: sad panda...
[21:36:39] *AutomatedTester needs a hot chocolate...

[21:38:04] dude-x: with the last gist you used?
[21:38:06] sayd: i didnt do the interpreter because i have a pretty long script and its
[21:38:10] dude-x: or did oyu make some change?
[21:38:21] dude-x: no, you just type the thing you're interested in
[21:38:22] sayd: dude-x: i made a small change 
[21:38:25] dude-x: you odn't have to type in all the commands
[21:38:44] sayd: dude-x: updated the gist

[21:40:01] dude-x: i see no difference
[21:40:25] dude-x: maybe it's slower than 2 minutes, and that it took 3 minutes?
[21:40:31] dude-x: up to 3 minutes
[21:41:11] sayd: i had to add the driver. in front of find_element_by_xpath
[21:42:46] dude-x: told you to do that earlier
[21:44:06] sayd: yeah it works much nicer :) but i forgot to call it on the driver
[21:44:23] sayd: i just had find_element... instead of driver.find_element...
[21:46:35] dude-x: did you get sytanx or attribute errors?
