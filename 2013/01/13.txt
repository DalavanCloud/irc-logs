[01:43:47] myeffort: Is there a way to make selenium open firefox in advance?
[01:45:51] myeffort: I notice that selenium spends most of the time on opening the window, and was wondering if such practical solution as opening the window at the end of the session and using it upon next test was possible.

[01:48:18] myeffort: I have tried selenium grid 2, but I did not experience any change. Firefox session ended and new one started out fresh, which again took full load time.
[01:50:38] myeffort: Though now i'm thinking if this was a flaw in my implementation, that required all windows to quit. I don't know if instances run on separate firefox sessions, but if they don't then keeping one window opne in the background should solve the problem.
[01:55:53] myeffort: Indeed selenium starts process per instance, I'd rather have it start new window OR start a process at the end of the session and use it next time.

[03:06:34] myeffort: So far there is only one solution one my mind: it's by running persistent proxy. Seems simple enough but I can't spend any more time with this at the moment. If anyone comes up with better/working solution, please let me know.

[06:06:55] MarkAnthony: adding JavaScriptExecutor in our webDriver tests will slow down our tests ? probable performance down in running scripts ?

[20:19:23] bfv313: Hi there, I have a question about selenium and testing on android devices.
[20:19:29] bfv313: Anyone have a free second?
[20:20:04] myeffort: What's up
[20:20:10] myeffort: Oh
[20:20:12] myeffort: No
[20:20:40] bfv313: Lol well ill just throw the problem out into the channel
[20:21:18] bfv313: I have the webdriver app installed and running correctly on a galaxy nexus android device.
[20:22:18] bfv313: My host machine is making a link and controlling the web page correctly through the USB connection
[20:22:55] bfv313: But if any of my scripts try to use things from the advanced user actions library such as doubleClick() it fails
[20:23:28] bfv313: It seems its a bug with reports still open but are there any workaround that exist? There isn't another way to double click that I can find
