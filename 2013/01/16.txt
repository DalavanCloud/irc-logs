[13:34:36] simonstewart: It returns a set of all top level browsing contexts
[13:34:55] simonstewart: So both
[13:35:00] simonstewart: The order is undefined
[13:35:28] Shakyj: doesn't seem to be getting firefox tabs for me

[13:36:08] aweiteka has joined #selenium
[13:36:26] simonstewart: Shakyj: you may need to wait for the window to open if it's opening because of a click
[13:37:42] Shakyj: It has about 10 tabs open and still tells me there is one open
[13:37:52] simonstewart: well, that's odd
[13:37:56] simonstewart: which version of firefox?
[13:37:57] simonstewart: 18?
[13:38:13] Shakyj: yeah 18.0
[13:38:33] simonstewart: Hmmmâ€¦ I don't know
[13:38:42] simonstewart: Is there a reproducible test case?
[13:38:57] Shakyj: yeah, seems strange just wondering if people had seen the same issue
[13:38:59] simonstewart: hang on
[13:39:00] simonstewart: stop
[13:39:04] simonstewart: tabs?
[13:39:07] Shakyj: yeah
[13:39:09] simonstewart: How did you get tabs to open?
[13:39:21] simonstewart: We override all the settings in firefox to force new windows to be windows
[13:39:35] Shakyj: Control.keyDown(Keys.CONTROL).click(link).keyUp(Keys.CONTROL).perform();
[13:39:40] simonstewart: None of the code in the firefox driver handles tabs
[13:39:46] simonstewart: well, nice to know that works
[13:40:26] Shakyj: lol, was trying to reduce the memory footprint by tabs
[13:40:39] simonstewart: Ah.

[13:45:03] simonstewart: coffee is like lifeblood
[13:45:19] Shakyj: coffee literally makes me throw up
[13:45:25] jimevans: so in java, how does the page factory handle caching with element lists? does it requery for the list? or just fill at first access?
[13:45:52] simonstewart: Dunno. I could find out
[13:45:58] simonstewart: barancev added lists, I think
[13:46:01] AutomatedTester: right...
[13:46:06] AutomatedTester: todo list sorted now
[13:46:09] AutomatedTester: emails read
[13:46:16] AutomatedTester: coffee to hand

[13:48:07] barancev: jimevans: lists are like elements, if there is CacheLookup annotation, it caches the list, otherwise it requeries
[13:48:21] AutomatedTester: i prefer NoAlertPresentExeption
[13:48:43] barancev: +1 for NoAlertPresentExeption
[13:48:47] jimevans: barancev: thanks.
[13:49:08] simonstewart: How come? It's a very different name to everything else
[13:49:20] simonstewart: And gets thrown by "driver.switchTo().alert()"
[13:50:04] barancev: NoSuchAlertException looks like we search for a specific alert, thre is no one, but may be there is an alert of some other kind
[13:50:26] barancev: simonstewart: you should know that we have trouble with FF18
[13:50:34] simonstewart: What's the beef?
[13:50:38] AutomatedTester: barancev: did you email eran?
[13:50:46] jimevans: y'know, jleyba brought up an interesting point on the dev list the other day, that "use JavascriptExecutor" is an increasingly common answer to a lot of questions about API pieces people perceive as "missing"
[13:51:09] simonstewart: yeah. I know
[13:51:20] simonstewart: Mainly because people are asking for things without a use case
[13:51:22] jimevans: i'm not sure whether to be disturbed by that or not.
[13:51:27] barancev: not yes, was busy, will write. webdriver-firefox-latest does not compile with gecko-18.  gecko-18\win32\include\nsISupportsImpl.h(24): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'prthread.h': No such file or directory

[13:52:15] simonstewart: Returning "Window" from the JavascriptExecutor seems nice
[13:52:22] barancev: and it seems that we have to decide which thir-party implementation to choose

[14:16:16] simonstewart: Anything else?
[14:17:09] ner0x has joined #selenium
[14:18:57] farlan has joined #selenium
[14:19:03] RossPatterson: "No RC" has multiple meanings.
[14:19:28] simonstewart: We remove Selenium RC and Core from the main distribution and leave them in a legacy library
[14:19:35] RossPatterson: There's my case, where we have tons of C# tests written against the API.  I understand that's a dead end, and we'll change to move or not advance.
[14:19:51] cgoldberg has joined #selenium
[14:20:11] jimevans: RossPatterson: You're already in this boat with C# today, in that the RC and WebDriver APIs are in different assemblies.
[14:20:22] RossPatterson: But from the selenium-users list and StackOverflow, I know there are lots of users running RC for the -htmlsuite capability - running IDE tests automatically.
[14:20:34] simonstewart: Yup
[14:20:43] RossPatterson: jimevans: Understood.  Still a dead end, deprecated lifestyle, etc. :-)
[14:20:54] simonstewart: You'll notice this is the release where we start the process of replacing IDE with Builder
[14:21:18] RossPatterson: At one point there was discussion of a "standalone test runner".  I don't think we got there.  Correct?
[14:21:33] *RossPatterson remembers an intern-ish project.  GSOC maybe?
[14:21:54] simonstewart: I've written one. Aslak wrote one too
[14:22:07] simonstewart: It's not that hard to run IDE tests using webdriver

[14:24:08] medwards: Does anyone know if there are any defects against element.is_displayed?
[14:24:33] RossPatterson: I haven't looked at SeBuilder, but is there an IDE-to-SeBuilder conversion path, something the masses of IDE users could use to get there?
[14:24:35] medwards: I'm running selenium 2.28.0 (python bindings) and can reliably cause an element to claim it is visible when it is not...
[14:24:50] simonstewart: RossPatterson: there will be
[14:24:59] RossPatterson: simonstewart: Cool.
[14:25:02] simonstewart: We'll run the two side-by-side for 3.x
[14:25:22] jimevans: medwards: you can reliably cause the issue. great. can you provide a page that demonstrates the problem?
[14:25:44] AutomatedTester: medwards: does it involve CSS3 transforms?
[14:26:05] medwards: jimevans: yeah posting it to gist right now
[14:26:06] AutomatedTester: medwards: can you raise a bug with a page that demonstrates the issue and let me know
[14:26:14] medwards: AutomatedTester: yeah I'll post the HTML ASAP
[14:26:26] *AutomatedTester is going to be doing visibility bugs today
[14:26:28] medwards: oh, just one thing to verify before I waste peoples time: It's an element with width and height of 0
[14:26:41] AutomatedTester: that shouldnt be visible
[14:26:43] medwards: I seem to remember the spec defining this as 'not visible' as well
[14:26:44] medwards: ok good
[14:26:56] medwards: just making sure the spec hadn't changed underneath me or something

[14:32:04] RossPatterson: simonstewart: What would WDBS's statues be in a 3.0 world?
[14:32:14] simonstewart: Legacy package
[14:32:25] medwards: Might take me a bit, salad wraps around splinter so normally I just launch using splinter and then access the selenium object it hides underneath itself
[14:32:34] simonstewart: The Selenium interface, Core and anything that depend on them would be hived out
[14:33:11] RossPatterson: "Legacy" == "Use this at your own risk, even moreso than @deprecated, may not be available much longer"?
[14:33:58] simonstewart: Something like that.
[14:34:10] simonstewart: I view it as "we don't intend to continue spending effort on this much longer"
[14:34:32] simonstewart: Since it's basically me making changes to RC right now that's not an unreasonable position.
[14:34:37] RossPatterson: "Legacy in 3.0" == "RC support level in 2.x" :-)
[14:34:55] simonstewart: RC started 2.0 on an equal footing with WebDriver
[14:35:03] simonstewart: (Better even)
[14:35:13] simonstewart: Over the course of the last year and a half, that balance has shifted.
[14:35:23] simonstewart: Time to acknowledge it
[14:36:21] RossPatterson: Understood.  Just trying to get a picture of the New World Order.  You're thinking about a State of the Project session at SeConf?

[14:41:03] AutomatedTester: with all the links
[14:41:29] medwards: I'd like to know if it repros for you too first
[14:41:38] AutomatedTester: um ok, one sec
[14:41:44] medwards: I was about to do it, but I hate submitting shite bugs yknow?
[14:44:54] AutomatedTester: medwards: so it should now say "Element returned was Loading.... with visibility equal to True"
[14:45:26] AutomatedTester: not say even
[14:45:30] medwards: yeah, assuming there is a defect
[14:45:42] medwards: If is_displayed is working as expected it should say False
[14:45:55] AutomatedTester: yea, raise it then
[14:46:02] medwards: wilco
[14:46:12] AutomatedTester: medwards: I have a few Mozilla tasks to do
[14:46:20] AutomatedTester: and then will be looking at other visibility bugs
[14:46:26] AutomatedTester: will lump this in there too
[14:47:45] medwards: AutomatedTester: will you execute any test script I post? Because I might have to write a repro script that calls "gimme_all_your_money" >.>
[14:48:02] AutomatedTester: medwards: I will
[14:48:15] AutomatedTester: medwards: you might be shocked by how much you get...
[14:48:32] *AutomatedTester reminds people he works for a NPO
[14:49:39] medwards: AutomatedTester: Yeah but if *everyone* there executes my script then it adds up. Easier than asking for a raise in a PO anyways :P

[14:51:40] vimto: Hi Guys. I'm trying to use selenium on an internal webapp. I am able to find and switchto any of the frames available with javascript disabled, but not with it enabled. With javascript enabled I cannot switchto any frames, by name or index. I've tried switching to default-content, frame(0), ("relative=top"). Its driving me bonkers. Could any of you point me to anything that may help me solve this. TIA

[14:58:12] miguel_: Hi again ;) .
[14:58:29] llaskin: is there a way to take a screenshot of th entire page(not just the area currently scrolled into view?)
[14:58:52] vimto: AutomatedTester: With firefoxProfile.setPreference("javascript.enabled", false);
[14:59:00] AutomatedTester: vimto: interesting
[14:59:10] AutomatedTester: llaskin: it should already do the full screen
[14:59:14] miguel_: I am developing a plugin formatter for the selenium ide firefox extension.
[14:59:15] llaskin: i tried using save_screenshot
[14:59:16] AutomatedTester: llaskin: if it doesnt its a bug
[14:59:18] jimevans: llaskin: that should be the default behavior of taking screenshot.
[14:59:20] llaskin: it only takes what is within scrollable view.
[14:59:28] jimevans: llaskin: what browser?
[14:59:41] llaskin: ff18
[14:59:51] miguel_: And I have not found documentation of the api. Where is it?
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Jan 16 15:00:14 2013]
[15:00:14] miguel_: At the moment I have read the sources of ruby and python.
[15:00:54] llaskin: miguel_: warning: the IDE will be removed from Selenium in the...future
[15:01:33] AutomatedTester: llaskin: sounds like a bug
[15:01:41] miguel_: but is there a new "extension" or something?
[15:03:04] llaskin: Selenium Builder is being added soon...
[15:04:18] ebi: Is selenium by default not waiting until the page completely loaded after a click?
[15:05:22] llaskin: ebi: you need either an implicit or explicit wait
[15:06:14] freynaud has joined #selenium
[15:06:53] llaskin: AutomatedTester: so the issue is, it doesn't handle internal scroll bars well
[15:06:54] ebi: llaskin: So I need to tell it to wait? Never saw that in the PHP API :(
[15:07:08] llaskin: ebi: ....why are you using Selenium 1?
[15:07:16] nirvdrum: Sorry, don't recall exactly who asked for it.  But as promised, I wrote up how we centralize all our grid logs using graylog: http://blog.mogotest.com/2013/01/16/centralized-selenium-logging-with-graylog  (also on HN)
[15:07:25] llaskin: also; AutomatedTester, it seems that since I have a scroll bar in a frame, it isn't taking the entire frame into account
[15:07:27] ebi: llaskin: I am not
[15:07:42] llaskin: ebi: php isn't supported in SE2....
[15:07:55] miguel_: yes I see the http://sebuilder.github.com/se-builder/
[15:07:55] adamgoucher has joined #selenium
[15:08:10] ebi: llaskin: PHPUnit has support for SE2
[15:08:22] llaskin: but SE2 does not support php as a language.
[15:08:43] miguel_: but at the moment, how to develop a plugin formatter?
[15:08:49] nirvdrum: People use it.  We just don't provide the bindings.
[15:09:02] llaskin: nirvdrum: correct
[15:09:38] *adamgoucher shows up and sees a 'wtf is up with php' type discussion and considers accidently hitting cmd-q
[15:09:51] llaskin: hahah adamgoucher
[15:09:52] nirvdrum: adamgoucher is our resident PHP expert.
[15:10:10] llaskin: good job nirvdrum...throw him under the bus
[15:10:23] adamgoucher: geez, if i have that mantle we're in pretty sad shape
[15:10:46] *adamgoucher just signed a php contract so, sssh
[15:11:08] nirvdrum: llaskin: I'll be adding FF18 support to mogotest soon.  I'll be able to tell you whether you're full of shit or not.
[15:12:00] nirvdrum: But it'd be hard for you to screw that up.
[15:12:19] ebi: Well the product I have to work with is written in PHP and I think it would make things even more complicated using a separate language for writing the tests
[15:13:01] medwards: adamgoucher: painful
[15:14:34] llaskin: nirv: its cuz its an internal scrollbar
[15:14:40] llaskin: so its a scrollbar inside a frame.
[15:14:48] llaskin: hence the problem
[15:14:56] adamgoucher: ebi: http://element34.ca/products/saunter
[15:15:14] llaskin: anyone here use Harvest time keeping software?
[15:15:27] adamgoucher: medwards: its not bad. php is actually a really nice language for building scripts in.
[15:17:39] AutomatedTester: llaskin: internal scroll bar?
[15:17:44] AutomatedTester: as in a frame?
[15:17:49] AutomatedTester: you have multiple frames?
[15:17:52] llaskin: yes.
[15:18:11] AutomatedTester: ahh the internal frame will only screenshot whats in the view port
[15:18:14] ebi: adamgoucher: Will take a look at that, thanks :)
[15:18:22] AutomatedTester: window.top will do the entire frame
[15:18:29] llaskin: window.top?
[15:18:32] ebi: adamgoucher: Does it mean you know that the PHPUnit bindings are bad?
[15:20:21] adamgoucher: ebi: not 'bad' per se, but i dont like the control they take away from you and/or how to configure them
[15:21:21] adamgoucher: ebi: what i want in a binding is an idiomatic wrapper around the protocol and thats it. not that the facebook one i forked is that, but its getting better the furrther from the original it gets
[15:21:29] AutomatedTester: llaskin: the top most frame in the browser
[15:21:45] llaskin: yea i understand
[15:21:50] llaskin: but how would I driver.take_screenshot of that?
[15:21:58] llaskin: because it seems thats a driver command, not an element one...
[15:23:07] AutomatedTester: of the inner frame?
[15:23:12] llaskin: yes
[15:23:19] AutomatedTester: wait for Marionette or use OperaDriver
[15:23:47] AutomatedTester: the screenshot code I added for marionette does elements and whole canvas

[16:30:01] lukeis: what don't you like about it?
[16:30:26] nirvdrum: It rewrites history.  That seem antithetical to the point of an SCM to me.

[16:31:25] nirvdrum: And you best hope no one has ever pulled from your branch :-P
[16:31:46] lukeis: that assumes you have it public somewhere
[16:31:50] AutomatedTester: I am not against squashing a merge
[16:32:00] AutomatedTester: but rebasing... hmmm feels like a smell
[16:32:42] nirvdrum: I can get behind squashing a merge if you've committed ping-ponging stuff.  It sucks when a large number of commits are squashed into a single one.  Too hard to see what the original intent was, assuming you used good commit messages.
[16:33:10] nirvdrum: It destroys the notion of logically related small commits.
[16:33:24] AutomatedTester: I can see value in removing commits like 'omg I added whitespace let me remove it'
[16:33:30] nirvdrum: Agreed.
[16:33:59] nirvdrum: But I've seen projects squash commits just because they want to be able to revert it more easily.
[16:34:10] AutomatedTester: no thats ba
[16:34:11] AutomatedTester: bad
[16:34:27] AutomatedTester: squash to remove nonsense commits only imho
[16:34:53] AutomatedTester: and patches should be the smallest amount of work to solve that issue
[16:34:56] nirvdrum: You could rebase to drop it too.  But that's rebasing within your branch.  I'm still not crazy about that though.
[16:35:14] AutomatedTester: a patch is what is merged
[16:35:15] lukeis: i agree there, i just don't like necessarily seeing the merge unless you actually had a conflict to resolve
[16:35:39] nirvdrum: lukeis: You should use SVN then :-P
[16:35:42] lukeis: ;)
[16:35:48] jimevans: yeah, sorry about that, guys. i fucked up.

[16:36:06] barancev: git+jenking experts: why my today's commit did not trigger the build?

[16:36:34] medwards: I do nothing other that git pull --rebase
[16:36:37] jimevans: s/didn't follow/was careless and didn't follow/
[16:37:07] nirvdrum: jimevans: I think the obvious answer here is that you should be chastised for committing to an open source project.
[16:37:30] jimevans: nirvdrum: i regret that decision every. single. day.

[16:50:19] nirvdrum: lukeis: Heh.  If it works for you, great.  I don't want to be a slave to my SCM.  I want to treat it as a safety net / dumping ground that I can periodically review history from.
[16:50:36] nirvdrum: People really like linearity in their history apparently though.
[16:50:45] lukeis: personal experience though on my internal projects is the commit history is very muddy and hard to ready because people don't squash commits / rebase merges when they can

[16:51:17] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: we are old-school when it comes to SCM then...

[16:52:14] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I guess.  I've been a DVCS guy for a while though.  Well before git I was using darcs, bzr, arch, svk, and accurev.

[16:58:47] eranm: quick question: I have a possible contributor interested in adding state cleanup for IE sessions (presumably in the IEDriver instantiation). Do you see any problem with adding that to the codebase?

[17:03:06] jimevans: eranm: not off the top of my head, but IE is fundamentally different from every other browser we support, in that a change to it's ecosystem is global for that user, not restricted to a specific profile.
[17:03:33] eranm: Right
[17:03:48] eranm: Perhaps having this behaviour enabled only when a capability is set would make more sense

[21:21:13] lukeis: a widget is just another PageObject
[21:21:22] lukeis: if you look at it like that you can use the Factory
[21:22:57] lukeis: then again, i don't use the Factory :)
[21:23:34] intrikit: And what do you do instead?
[21:23:42] intrikit: Do you just deal directly with the elements?
[21:24:09] lukeis: mostly, but I define the By's for each of them as private members of the class
[21:24:42] lukeis: factory deals with that part nicer
[21:25:05] intrikit: That is what I was thinking of doing. I like the annotations and cachelookup but I feel like it keeps forcing me down a path i'm not happy with.
[21:27:12] intrikit: So if I have HeaderNavigation hn = new HeaderNavigation; declared in HomePage class, do I need to do init the elements on the HeaderNavigation and the HomePage? Or will just the PageFactory pickup that the hn member has annotated members as well?
[21:31:45] jimevans: intrikit: i'm not used to the java implementation of the page factory, but i'd imagine you'd need to call InitElements for each component.

[21:33:04] AutomatedTester: jimevans: why?
[21:33:15] jimevans: #4817
[21:33:16] selbot2_: 03 open/new Chrome webdriver fails to start from TFS build agent. - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4817 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Status-Untriaged Browser-IE Browser-Chrome]
[21:34:25] harly: reading 03_webdriver it instructs me to create a pom.xml file and gives me a link to the maven download page to check the current release. the link is seleniumhq.org/download/maven.jsp but I am struggling to see what I download to install from that page. should I search elsewhere for basic maven install?
[21:35:00] llaskin has left #selenium
[21:35:14] AutomatedTester: jimevans: want me to put  a tactful comment in there?
[21:36:44] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i'd do it, but i fear i lack the necessary tact. the real problem is that it's a platform no one has available to test on, so i'm not surprised there might be issues.
[21:37:24] lukeis: harly: that's the 'simple' way to get started with javaâ€¦ do you want to use java? (c#, ruby, python are also offically supported)
[21:37:38] AutomatedTester: jimevans: i'll field this one
[21:37:48] lukeis: heh "What the hell did you guys do? did you purposely make it incompatible with TFS? "  <- I did! I did!
[21:38:11] *lukeis doesn't even know what TFS is
[21:38:29] harly: well. i know near nothing of selenium so am trying to learn. I am familiar with java and can use that if it is the best way. my preference would be perl, but in my experience perl support for things like this is more trouble that it's worth. really I just want to get started. :)

[21:50:03] AutomatedTester: I had a facepalm moment on there
[21:50:07] dawagner: :)
[21:50:44] dawagner: santiycr: The reason upload.sh exists is because otherwise jenkins will output our API key to the console log
[21:51:02] dawagner: jimevans: How would you feel about adding proxyManager.restoreRegistrySettings(true); to InternetExplorerDriver.quit()?
[21:51:46] dawagner: :note simonstewart Tell me about super packing and I can poke people :)
[21:51:47] selbot2_: ok!
[21:52:10] jimevans: dawagner: you mean in the driver proper, or in the bindings?
[21:52:34] dawagner: For now, in the bindings
[21:52:47] dawagner: I'd like to push the proxy stuff in to the driver at some point, but that's another bridge :)
[21:53:19] jimevans: considering that not all bindings have proxy management, i'm not sure i care that much.
[21:53:38] dawagner: Cool :)
[21:53:48] jimevans: i'm not sure it's such a great idea to be hacking the user's registry, but whatever.
[21:54:12] jimevans: especially given that it affects *everything* the user's doing on the machine.
[21:55:27] dawagner: I agree :) I'd love a way to set the proxy just for the browser
[21:55:46] dawagner: But right now, the behaviour is that we change the user's proxy, and then we don't reset it until the selenium server is closed
[21:56:33] jimevans: dawagner: bear in mind, though, there's a potential multiple driver instance problem 
[21:56:38] dawagner: Yeah :(
[21:56:59] dawagner: It changes from "last started driver sets prefs" to "last stopped driver sets prefs"
[21:57:14] dawagner: I'd hope that people aren't setting multiple proxies in different drivers, in which case it should be a no-op
[21:57:32] dawagner: Well, unless the first driver is quit...
[21:57:34] dawagner: Bleugh :(
[21:57:54] *jimevans watches dawagner run into the intellectual wall that is IE preferences
[21:58:07] dawagner: Yep :(
[21:58:29] dawagner: meh, anyone futzing with system-level settings and multiple drivers deserves whatever they get
[21:58:29] jimevans: and that's exactly why the IE driver doesn't even attempt to set the proxy information as of now.
[21:58:43] dawagner: Yeah, reasonably so
[21:58:55] jimevans: sure, but you're still leaving the system in a different state than when it started.
[21:59:06] jimevans: (potentially)
[21:59:28] dawagner: We do that now too
[21:59:33] jimevans: where?
[21:59:38] dawagner: The shutdown hook ordering isn't deterministic

[22:56:35] admc has joined #selenium
[22:56:50] p_l: yes. But password protection makes no sense
[22:56:53] harly: and in windows xp when i extract the files, it asks for a passord for a bunch of the fiiles in the archive.  poms, and others.
[22:57:02] harly: i agree, it makes no sense. but that's what it does.
[22:57:14] p_l: harly: I suggest downloading a different unpacker

[22:57:42] p_l: windows might be misunderstanding some stuff (happens - it doesn't do full, current PKZIP spec, afaik)

[23:03:41] harly: right, so it's p_l.  looks like a 1 to me. and the window font is different to the input field font.  dumb.
[23:04:47] p_l: anyway, I'm starting to get sick of doing web acceptance/integration testing :/
[23:05:23] harly: so. this isn't a selenium question. installing eclipse for the first time. on a tutorial i watched for getting selenium set up they go file -> new -> java project.  but when I install either eclipse standard, or eclipse java, there are no options under new ->. it has a grey "no applicable items".
[23:05:24] p_l: need to find myself a different, interesting project
[23:05:55] p_l: harly: hmmm... eclipse java should have "other" at least, where you can find "java project"
[23:06:53] harly: nope.  but eclipse EE has a bunch of options. can i just use that?
[23:07:00] p_l: maybe
[23:07:12] *p_l doesn't use Eclipse when he can avoid that
[23:07:16] harly: jpa, EAP, DWP, EJB, blah blah blah
[23:07:34] harly: yeah well. i'm not normally a java develpoer. i just want to get started with a hello world selenium :)
[23:07:54] harly: so $200 for intellij is out of scope right now
[23:08:00] lukeis: esh, harly if you go the maven route, install maven, create the pom, then run 'mvn eclipse:eclipse' on the command line, then in eclipse you can import -> existing project
[23:08:10] harly: ok
[23:08:32] lukeis: make sure you install the m2eclipse plugin
[23:08:42] p_l: lukeis: afaik eclipse:eclipse isn't suggested route for a long time now?
[23:08:57] lukeis: suggested by who? :)
[23:09:32] lukeis: it still works to 'get started' ;)
[23:09:42] harly: ^ is important
[23:09:43] harly: :)
[23:09:46] p_l: lukeis: I've been fighting with maven recently and seen people recalling the "old days" when they had to eclipse:eclipse and stuff was generally shitty ;)
[23:10:31] harly: i installed maven and ran the suggested command but it complained about HOME not being set for java.
[23:10:43] lukeis: ok, other option, install the plugin and then you should find an option to import -> maven project
[23:11:12] harly: but honestly, it seems maven is really an unecessary middleman?
[23:11:31] lukeis: it's a package manager to grab the dependencies for you
[23:11:39] lukeis: you don't *have* to use it
[23:11:43] harly: is it a replacement for ant?
[23:11:47] harly: i remember that giving me headaches int he past
[23:11:49] lukeis: yes
[23:12:02] harly: but here there's like 1 dependency isn't there? the server jar
[23:12:08] lukeis: ant == make in my mind ;)
[23:12:12] adamgoucher: ant + ivy = maven. sorta.
[23:12:29] harly: well see. i'm a unix head. why make a replacement for make when make works just fine ;)
[23:12:41] lukeis: exactly ;)
[23:12:54] p_l: maven is not a package manager, not a dependency manager, not a build system - it's a philosophy
[23:13:01] lukeis: ant == make only done in xml (an absolute horror to me)
[23:13:06] adamgoucher: if you are a unix head, wtf are you trying to do anything with java?
[23:13:15] p_l: also, make was broken from day one, but it escaped the asylum before the author could rm -rf it
[23:13:25] harly: adamgoucher: because that seems to be the main choice for selenium? 
[23:13:48] lukeis: it's A choice
[23:13:49] adamgoucher: not really â€¦ or is with people who dont know better. :D
[23:14:14] harly: well there's python and ruby. and given i'm a perl developer I consider those to be languages for children.
[23:14:22] harly: so what other unix choice would you suggest?
[23:14:29] adamgoucher: there are perl bindings kicking about...
[23:15:00] harly: trueeee.... but they aren't connected to the main project. in my experience using experimental perl bindings is more trouble than it's worth in the long run.
[23:15:10] harly: given the goal is to test, not advocate for a language.
[23:15:43] harly: what do you use on unix?
[23:15:47] adamgoucher: well, the goal is likely not to learn a new lanugage either...
[23:15:52] adamgoucher: python, ruby or php
[23:16:15] harly: oh language doesn't bother me much. I know java as well as I know c++, and I contribute to 2 c++ projects.

[23:22:29] harly: p_l: jetbrains?
[23:22:54] AutomatedTester: harly: the community version is quite good
[23:22:57] p_l: harly: yes
[23:23:03] harly: ok i'll try that out.
[23:23:14] p_l: the community version misses some stuff, but it shouldn't be a problem for majority of uses
[23:23:27] harly: mainly because I like the drunken tutorial that uses intellij. and a mac.
[23:23:35] harly: pity he only made 1.
[23:23:47] harly: should'nt have opened that beer at the end i guess.
[23:24:03] AutomatedTester: harly: that was his 3rd while recording
[23:24:14] AutomatedTester: well at least his 3rd
[23:24:16] harly: not bad for 10 minutes
[23:24:28] AutomatedTester: he editted it ...
[23:24:38] AutomatedTester: iirc
[23:28:21] AutomatedTester:  sod it
[23:28:23] AutomatedTester: going to bed
[23:28:25] AutomatedTester: laters
[23:34:48] ardwalker has joined #selenium
[23:34:52] harly: excuse the basic questions: using intellij community version when creating a new project it warns about not having selected an SDK. that isn't a step that appears in the drunket intellij tutorial. can I ignore that? or do I need to resolve it.
[23:35:30] lukeis: i think it assumes java installed / linked to intellij
[23:35:43] harly: ok i'll try and push through
[23:36:12] harly: well. java is installed.  linked to intellij, no idea

[23:51:30] danielwh: Damn!
[23:51:49] danielwh: What was barancev complaining about about a polling log earlier? :)
[23:52:12] lukeis: oh, the regex pattern for excluding folders to pay attention to when building all
[23:52:18] lukeis: ** is not a valid regex ;)
[23:52:20] lukeis: .* is
[23:52:27] *lukeis changed it
[23:52:45] danielwh: Aha, I assumed it was ant-style globs :) Thanks for fixing
[23:57:31] harly: p_l: looking that up now. is this plug in related? or not.  asking because of what google points to
[23:58:54] p_l: I don't have it handy right now, but you select it per-project and per-module
[23:58:58] p_l: language settings, iirc
[23:59:22] harly: ok hang on. i just installed java. i don't think that installed jdk. so probably an easy fix.
[23:59:55] p_l: harly: still, you'll have to point IntelliJ at correct one (it supports multiple, that's why)
