[14:36:27] jost: Hi. On my website, located at http://example.com/page , I want to test if an img-tag has an initially empty src-Attribute. That works fine in most cases, when asked for the src-Attribute the webdriver returns "". But not on IE7, there it returns "http://example.com/page/", which makes the test fail. Is there any solution for this problem, e.g. some sort of normalizer in  the WebDriver?
[14:36:58] jost: I really don't want to always check if the path is either empty or the pages path without filename.

[14:56:00] adamgoucher: are you sure your app isnt misbehaving? (and can you reproduce it outside of your app against just a static file)
[14:57:43] jost: I have not found a way to check that
[14:58:17] jost: IE7 has no option for DOM inspection (that I know of), and the source code shows the XML the HTML is generated from
[14:59:37] jost: but in that XML the code is correctly set to <img src="" alt="" style="width: 0; heigth: 0" />
