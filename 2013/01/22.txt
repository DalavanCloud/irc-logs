[04:27:27] nirvdrum: Are you using the RC protocol?
[04:27:33] nirvdrum: MarcWeber: ^
[04:27:43] nirvdrum: plightbo_work: Thanks for getting that release out.
[04:29:34] plightbo_work: no problem. I'll be doing more regularly too
[04:29:59] nirvdrum: I take it you didn't have any issues with the stuff I pushed?
[04:31:54] nirvdrum: I wanted to get your feelings on removing that 30 connection limit, too.  It looks like you guys added it to emulate some older Firefox 3 behavior.  But that seems pretty limiting as a general purpose proxy server.
[04:36:04] plightbo_work: nirvdrum: yeah, there are a few things that are very firefox specific that we should pull out
[04:36:19] plightbo_work: and probably should introduce an API to control some of that stuff
[04:36:34] plightbo_work: if you haven't noticed, error responses are totally firefox-specific :)
[04:36:54] plightbo_work: it all dates back to trying to make BrowserMob (the load testing tool) behave just like Firefox since that was the only browser we use
[04:36:54] nirvdrum: I did.  I saw that error page a lot over the weekend.
[04:37:16] plightbo_work: it's also why the User-Agent is rewritten that way - so people could identify the source of load testing traffic if it bothered them :)
[04:37:16] nirvdrum: Working out that Java 7 upstream proxy SNI thing took the better part of the day.  I was rather frustrated.
[04:37:39] nirvdrum: And I couldn't find the HttpClient 4.1 docs anywhere since 4.2 has been released.
[04:38:03] nirvdrum: Heh.  I do have that issue open to remove the user agent.  It seems like doing that through a custom header might be the better way to go.
[04:38:10] nirvdrum: But I didn't want to be the guy to yank your branding :-P
[04:38:37] plightbo_work: nah, that's fine
[04:38:42] phishy has joined #selenium
[04:38:43] nirvdrum: I'm really happy that running with "--help" doesn't raise an exception anymore.
[04:38:49] plightbo_work: i actually think the project needs a rename anyway, since BrowserMob as a brand is dead now
[04:39:08] nirvdrum: And did I miss something or is there just no test suite?

[10:43:09] AutomatedTester: dawagner: has that broken something?
[10:43:37] dawagner: It opens up the regex to include everything, and I'm wondering why, given that identifiers are well specified...
[10:44:25] AutomatedTester: dawagner: Firefox is giving more information now in stacks
[10:45:40] dawagner: What information specifically was the change for?

[10:48:00] andreastt: simonstewart: Quite.
[10:48:46] barancev: dawagner: . inside [] is just a dot, not "any symbol"
[10:49:29] barancev: I've added three new allowed symbols to the regexp: ./<
[10:50:46] dawagner: Are there details as to what has been added to firefox to necessitate this?
[10:51:48] barancev: dawagner: better JS stack trace
[10:52:00] dawagner: Yeah, but how did you come to those characters?
[10:52:45] barancev: dawagner: I run our regression tests and watched what's new is in stack trace
[10:53:44] barancev: they implemented better tracing of method names, incuding tracing of "anonymous functions"
[10:54:27] dawagner: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=433529
[10:54:37] dawagner: That looks like it

[10:55:35] barancev: yes, a.b, a/b and a<
[10:55:58] barancev: exactly those symbols I've added to the regexp

[11:15:26] p_l: AutomatedTester: they are building for a market that, IMO, doesn't exists yet
[11:15:43] p_l: nor will it exists in "scale" manner any time soon
[11:15:44] tms_: dawagner: action.key_down(:control) does not work in firefox18 using webdriver 2.29.0 (ruby) win 7
[11:15:57] AutomatedTester: p_l: what market do you think that is?
[11:16:53] p_l: AutomatedTester: they rely a bit much on internet being available, at least that's the usual thing I notice from "browser OS" approaches, without good "completely local, no externalities" application platform included (no, HTML5 Cache doesn't count, it's borked in many ways)
[11:17:47] AutomatedTester: p_l: apps, unless web based apps, are served locally
[11:17:56] AutomatedTester: it doesnt rely on the internet being there
[11:18:13] p_l: AutomatedTester: We'll see what kind of apps they will end up having :)
[11:18:30] p_l: but in this space, I'm really not that interested in such experiments
[11:18:53] AutomatedTester: p_l: all the major apps that people tend to have on Android/iOS are already working there
[11:19:38] AutomatedTester: I appreciate that I am too close to it but we have a learnt a lot from WebOS and ChromeOS
[11:20:31] p_l: ... ouch. I didn't notice it earlier... but that's one shitty cpu too choose
[11:21:11] AutomatedTester: p_l: going back to market... what market do you think we going for?
[11:21:35] p_l: AutomatedTester: I'm talking about "normal people off the street who got lured into smartphones (any ones)"
[11:22:33] AutomatedTester: p_l: we are targeting people, in developing countries, that have never had access to smartphones and lack the money to buy ArmV7 and iOS devices
[11:22:34] Ardesco: you know the world is screwed when kim dotcom makes sense and his websites are no longer bullshit
[11:22:37] tms_: dawagner: Can you help me in that ?
[11:22:37] p_l: and while I can see some potential if they provide a good API for local apps (which will probably break the promise of "use only HTML5 standard apis")...
[11:22:41] Ardesco: I mean seriously
[11:22:42] Ardesco: wtf
[11:22:43] Ardesco: ?
[11:22:59] p_l: the hw they made for "developer" phone is really... backwards
[11:23:28] AutomatedTester: p_l: its what people will be getting
[11:23:51] AutomatedTester: build for the lowest common denominator...
[11:24:26] p_l: AutomatedTester: by the time it goes on market, even crapphones will have better specs (not sure if they don't have them already)
[11:24:42] p_l: that's not lowest common denominator, that's lowest common denominator of >1y ago
[11:24:57] p_l: ... ok, 0.5y ago
[11:24:59] AutomatedTester: ok, lets agree to disagree then
[11:25:34] p_l: AutomatedTester: and I hope they got some upgraded variant of Qualcomm S1
[11:26:03] caddoo has joined #selenium
[11:26:17] p_l: while it was quite a hit in android world with N1, let's say the google employees who actually worked on the OS had to pull some careful engineering to make it enjoyable :)
[11:26:23] AutomatedTester: p_l: if you can design a $50 phone with better specs then I am sure Telefonica would approach that idea
[11:27:12] p_l: well, will see
[11:27:39] AutomatedTester: p_l: we are targeting south america where armv7 and iOS devices are stupidly expensive
[11:27:57] AutomatedTester: and africa
[11:28:12] AutomatedTester: p_l: you know Google is taking armv6 devices into Africa right?
[11:28:27] AutomatedTester: thats their main android devices they are pushing
[11:29:06] p_l: AutomatedTester: ok, that might work
[11:29:15] AutomatedTester: p_l: thats our market
[11:29:34] AutomatedTester: we may have done a little research into this
[11:29:43] p_l: good :)
[11:30:16] p_l: one thing - do you expose SIM card APIs?
[11:30:31] AutomatedTester: yes
[11:30:35] p_l: Cause that's something that is "make it or break it" in quite a lot of places in Africa
[11:30:52] p_l: (that is, I had devs complain to me about it)
[11:31:05] AutomatedTester: https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI
[11:31:40] AutomatedTester: SIM is a big one, especially multi-SIM devices
[11:32:35] AutomatedTester: http://arewemobileyet.com/
[11:33:02] p_l: umm... I don't see SIM API there
[11:33:21] AutomatedTester: I have seen it in a mail somewhere
[11:33:51] AutomatedTester: its been discussed
[11:34:31] p_l: Well, you'll need support for SIM-based applications (i.e. ones that are stored and run on SIM card) and interface to them if you want to make any dent in (at least some parts of) Africa
[11:34:48] AutomatedTester: p_l: depends really
[11:35:16] AutomatedTester: some places have better connectivity for smartphones than Europe
[11:35:26] AutomatedTester: Eastern Africa for example
[11:35:35] p_l: AutomatedTester: it's not about connectivity - it's about services based on it
[11:36:09] samphippen has joined #selenium
[11:36:12] p_l: They have systems that work fine for them which use this feature, and no one will redo it just to appease a minor platform
[11:36:34] AutomatedTester: the web is a minor platform?
[11:39:26] p_l: AutomatedTester: in this case... yes. Without such APIs, they might not choose to buy a smartphone when a dumbphone will work with the stuff they already have, like iirc banking and payment solutions that involve application preloaded by operators into SIM card (so they work as identity and secure element)
[11:39:53] p_l: but the platform for a normal person here would be "Firefox OS", not Web
[11:40:05] p_l: Web is "external" for a normal user
[11:40:08] AutomatedTester: interesting...
[11:40:29] AutomatedTester: fwiw, banks in South Africa are moving away from SIM based apps
[11:40:33] p_l: (and mobile networking sucked, sucks, and will suck for at least some time)
[11:40:58] AutomatedTester: mobile networking in Africa is better than in most of Europe...
[11:41:12] p_l: AutomatedTester: There's also the benefit of "it will just work with stuff I already do"
[11:41:47] p_l: AutomatedTester: the "sucks" I mention is related to things you can't fix by better coverage or anything like that - and I actually know a company that works on it and possibly deployed some in South Africa :)
[11:42:13] p_l: TCP simply doesn't like the drops caused by cellular networks
[11:48:10] p_l: Anyway, the only real judge will be reality :)
[11:49:13] p_l: I guess I've been pretty tired with "everything should move to 'cloud' (meaning Web)" luminaries while I've been dealing with 3s pings that made me learn to use SSH without seeing feedback
[11:50:15] p_l: (yes, on mobile)

[15:25:55] laffer1_: simonstewart: I once had to write a LISP interpreter by hand in C in college.  Once you've done it once, the desire never comes back.
[15:26:19] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the 2nd one is normally always there
[15:26:20] simonstewart: Well, there's the thing, you see. I also had to write a parser while at university
[15:26:33] simonstewart: Apparently after more than a decade the desire _does_ come back
[15:26:35] teodosia_sel has left #selenium
[15:26:37] jimevans: AutomatedTester: interesting.
[15:26:59] laffer1_: That is a scary thought. 
[15:27:12] laffer1_: I went crazy in a whole other way and started an OS project.
[15:27:20] AutomatedTester: jimevans: iirc the 2nd one is what is read when you just type firefox in cmd prompt
[15:27:25] simonstewart: I think that's more crazy
[15:27:34] jimevans: i was looking in HKLM\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox for the "CurrentVersion" value.
[15:27:46] jimevans: which is apparently in HKCU.
[15:27:52] laffer1_: You're probably right.
[15:27:59] simonstewart: :)
[15:28:02] AutomatedTester: jimevans: it works for me but I dont know if it is "The Right Way"
[15:28:03] simonstewart: Both are pretty crazy
[15:31:36] AutomatedTester: jimevans: that working for you?
[15:31:58] jimevans: yeah, changing from HKLM to HKCU worked a treat.
[15:32:20] jimevans: i just don't know if that is a recent change, or if the installer always wrote to that registry location.
[15:32:41] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the shell one is normally a good enough one
[15:32:45] jimevans: and i was always looking in the wrong one.
[15:32:51] AutomatedTester: since it gives you the path to the latest installed firefox
[15:34:20] jimevans: AutomatedTester: well, that registry query isn't the end of it, as i then go to the sub key of HKCU\Software\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox\<current version string>\Main, and get the value of PathToExe, which contains the full path to firefox.
[15:36:38] AutomatedTester: jimevans: but you need to keep track of version numbers then right?
[15:37:35] jimevans: no, it's just a two step process. first query HKCU\Software\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox and get the value of "CurrentVersion
[15:37:48] simonstewart: pl
[15:37:58] jimevans: that value becomes the <current version string> in the other sub key.
[15:38:39] AutomatedTester: jimevans: have a look at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\Applications\firefox.exe\shell\open\command
[15:38:44] AutomatedTester: and see what that gives you
[15:38:58] AutomatedTester: pretty sure that will save you some energy

[16:47:14] plightbo_work: nirvdrum: would you like the ability to make BMP releases in the future? Pretty much the only thing you need is an account on the Sonatype OSS Nexus system with permissions for the biz.neustar group
[16:47:57] plightbo_work: nirvdrum: though, on that note, I'm thinking we should maybe pull the project out of biz.neustar and also rename it from BMP to something else. I'm no longer with Neustar and the BrowserMob brand is dead and they aren't working on the proxy at all anymore. Even Ivan, who does a few things with it, isn't there anymore.
[16:48:01] nirvdrum: plightbo_work: Sure.  Do you have docs on what's involved?
[16:48:53] jleyba: simonstewart: in blog post, I'd change "we are planning to end official support for Firefox 3.x" to just "we are planning to end support for Firefox 3.x"
[16:49:16] plightbo_work: nirvdrum: it's really, really, really easy. I'll get docs set up, but basically you need to have gpg set up locally, send the pub key to a gpg service like MIT, and your Nexus password set up in ~/.m2/settings.xml. Once that one-time work is done, the release is literally: "mvn release:prepare release:perform"
[16:49:24] nirvdrum: plightbo_work: Sounds like it might be a good time to reignite conversation with simonstewart over a semi-official community repo.  We had tabled it until after the git conversion.
[16:49:54] simonstewart: jleyba: done
[16:49:56] simonstewart: Thanks
[16:50:05] nirvdrum: Francois and I wanted to have a place to put grid plugins without having to maintain in Selenim proper.  But somewhat consolidated so people don't have to go to N different repos.

[16:55:14] simonstewart: But if it breaks accidentally we'll be closing any bugs opened with "WontFix"
[16:55:17] RossPatterson: So we're not raising the Firefox plugins' minversions to 10?
[16:55:34] simonstewart: We _might_
[16:55:45] lukeis: simonstewart: 2.29 has a problem with FF3.6 that barancev fixed i believe, should we release soonish :)

[16:58:01] simonstewart: then modify the extension to cause all content to blink in 3.x for two releases

[16:58:07] simonstewart: Then bump the min version

[16:59:40] jimevans: jleyba: so what's the approach for building the prebuilt safari extension?
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jan 22 17:00:00 2013]
[17:00:00] jimevans: is that encapsulated as part of the build process via crazy-fun, or is it a manual step?
[17:00:21] jleyba: Has to be done manually.  AFAIK there's no way to generate the package from the command line
[17:00:53] jleyba: Could probably do something with apple script, but that would only work for OSX
[17:00:56] jimevans: i didn't think so either. i looked at that a few months back and didn't find anything either.
[17:01:11] Spanktar has joined #selenium
[17:01:23] jimevans: so language bindings wanting to include the safari extension should simply rely on the prebuilt?
[17:01:40] simonstewart: SBTM, but hard to avoid
[17:01:44] simonstewart: SGTM
[17:02:49] *jimevans has to update the .net bindings to embed the safari extension as a resource and extract at runtime, and has to create code for installing the extension in .NET.
[17:03:05] jimevans: because, y'know, relying on java sucks.
[17:04:16] jleyba: jimevans: Take a look at the SafariDriverExtension class.  The logic for unpacking and installing the extension is relatively straight forward
[17:07:01] jimevans: jleyba: how are you handling the possibility of multiple safari instances?
[17:08:09] jleyba: I don't do anything to prevent it, but it's not support either
[17:08:20] jleyba: supported*
[17:08:54] jleyba: on Windows you can only have one Safari instance.  Creating multiple SafariDrivers will just give you multiple controllers for the same browser instance

[18:39:42] bfife: all internet access is proxied out, i dont know that anyone has gotten access inbound ever
[18:40:30] bfife: but usetrace doesnt look like you'd ever be able to get a local instance.. i imagine they host it in its entirety
[18:41:06] bfife: it probably wouldn't be too bad to build a framework for running tests and showing screenshots via browser, i wouldn't think. was just wondering if anyone else had
[18:41:20] lukeis: i saw them demo on a 'local' box… they seem flexible and willing to do work for customers ;) so asking if they could do a local instance, might not hurt
[18:41:35] bfife: money would be another factor tho ;) but that's fair

[20:00:57] barancev: what other library do we use now?
[20:01:35] jimevans: for IE7, we use sizzle, for IE8+ we use the browser's native CSS selector engine.
[20:02:36] jimevans: so updating the javascript implementation would not change its behavior on IE8+
[20:03:06] barancev: yes, but it'll fix IE7, right?

[23:04:20] ShawnM: what version off ff and the webdriver are you using
[23:04:29] ShawnM: we have firefox drag drop methods that work in mac firefox
[23:04:43] ShawnM: and in native events linux ff
[23:05:48] seb_m: ff 18.0.1
[23:05:59] seb_m: not sure about the webdriver
[23:06:56] seb_m: i installed the 'selenium-server-standalone' homebrew package. that's version 2.28.0
[23:07:24] ShawnM: we use this
[23:07:25] ShawnM: http://code.google.com/p/jqueryjs/source/browse/trunk/plugins/simulate/jquery.simulate.js?r=6063
[23:07:33] ShawnM: to help simulate the drag and dropping
[23:07:40] be has joined #selenium
[23:07:53] ShawnM: assuming you need jquery loaded on the page for it to work though
[23:08:11] seb_m: i have jquery
[23:08:39] ShawnM: isec i'll link how we implement it might or might not help you

[23:09:34] seb_m: i am totally new to selenium
[23:09:43] seb_m: so anything will help :)
[23:12:48] ShawnM: http://pastebin.com/nfPpn1Er
[23:14:05] seb_m: so what should i do with this
[23:14:38] ShawnM: well you'll have to build these methods in your frame work and make them available at run time for you code
[23:14:43] seb_m: okay
[23:15:16] ShawnM: then pass the the element you want to drag and the element you want to drag it to 
[23:15:23] ShawnM: to the js_drag_and_drop
[23:15:25] ShawnM: method
[23:15:34] ShawnM: this is certainly not native events though
[23:16:15] seb_m: but you've managed to click/drag in mac browsers using this?
[23:17:56] smccarthy2 has joined #selenium
[23:18:54] ShawnM: yep
[23:19:28] ShawnM: so in the js drag and drop method it says target =  f source selector
[23:19:30] jleyba_: AutomatedTester: there's a selection committee.  I don't know who's on it though
[23:19:57] AutomatedTester: jleyba_: please influence them so I can show off FirefoxOS and Marionette
[23:20:15] jleyba_: lol
[23:20:31] jleyba_: will it be XX% faster than our current FFDriver?
[23:20:50] ShawnM: i think you also need to create the methods i'll be linking in a sec aswell to make it easier
[23:21:31] ShawnM: so that selenium doesn't throw an exception when an element isn't found it rescues with nil and lets you find elements a bit easier than with just driver.find_elements
[23:21:48] ShawnM: we both using ruby luckily
[23:21:49] AutomatedTester: jleyba_: it is faster
[23:22:00] AutomatedTester: jleyba_: I havent measured but it feels faster
[23:22:21] AutomatedTester: jleyba_: we have started getting the "Marionette is too quick" type bugs
[23:23:00] jleyba_: note: jimevans I have not tried unpacking from the jar on windows, but our infrastructure here installs the extension programmatically on WinXP, so I know that works.  Unpacking from the jar just uses a different src file
[23:23:02] AutomatedTester: jleyba_: moz#830197
[23:23:04] selbot2: 03Nobody; OK to take it and work on it NEW/ Marionette not waiting long enough before send_keys - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=830197
[23:23:14] jleyba_: boo, did i get the syntax wrong on that note?
[23:23:24] AutomatedTester: jleyba_: yea
[23:23:32] AutomatedTester: the : should be in front of note
[23:23:35] AutomatedTester: not after
[23:23:37] ShawnM: seb what testing framework are you using rspec?
[23:23:44] jleyba_: :note jimevans I have not tried unpacking from the jar on windows, but our infrastructure here installs the extension programmatically on WinXP, so I know that works.  Unpacking from the jar just uses a different src file
[23:23:44] selbot2: ok!
[23:24:16] jleyba_: AutomatedTester: send keys is too fast... love those bugs
[23:24:34] AutomatedTester: yup
[23:24:51] AutomatedTester: i am off
[23:24:53] AutomatedTester: laters
[23:28:07] ShawnM: http://pastebin.com/3qxzHGzW
[23:28:18] ShawnM: need these for the drag and drop stuff to work seb
[23:28:27] ShawnM: just the 2 defs
[23:45:20] seb_m: ShawnM: hey sorry for the delay. i am not using a testing framework atm, i am just writing a standalone script
[23:48:18] ShawnM: ok well this should still work 
[23:48:44] ShawnM: just know that if an element isn't found it returns nil or an empty array 
[23:48:54] ShawnM: with the f and ff methods
[23:54:52] seb_m: i'll give this a shot, thanks
