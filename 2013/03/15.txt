[00:46:22] JohanM: Hey. Is there any way to start Firefox minimized through Selenium?
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Mar 15 01:13:05 2013]
[01:13:05] adamgoucher: how would a user do that?
[01:14:35] adamgoucher: plightbo_work: how hard would it be to have the bmp recycle ports? (say, grab 10 at startup and when the client closes or a period of inactivity releases it back into the pool)
[01:15:45] plightbo_work: pretty easy
[01:15:49] plightbo_work: just need an hour to code it up
[01:16:45] adamgoucher: had a client complain the scripts were crapping out â€¦ bmp said something to the effect of could not allocate a port. restarted and it worked again. had been running for 3 days while she mucked about
[01:17:11] plightbo_work: yeah if you start/stop the proxy a lot it'll do that. it was originally designed for you to sort of create a fixed number of proxies that you'd then reuse
[01:17:25] plightbo_work: for example... maybe # of concurrent RBUs perhaps :)
[01:18:01] adamgoucher: hrm. maybe my mental model is broken on how to use it :D
[01:18:15] itatitat: guys im trying to run by hand some selenium tests in a server, I want to run firefox in the server, not in my station
[01:18:24] plightbo_work: nah, it just needs to evolve... it's really minor to support 1 proxy per test case
[01:18:26] itatitat: I made export Display:0
[01:18:56] itatitat: but from the .jar I see the output in console:" Failed to start new browser session, shutdown browser and clear all session data
[01:18:56] itatitat: "

[13:56:10] davehunt has joined #selenium
[13:56:50] AutomatedTester: headless has nothing to do with functional testing
[13:59:15] p_l: riv_: headless as in what, HtmlUnit kind of thing?
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Mar 15 14:00:31 2013]
[14:00:31] riv_: we were looking at phantomjs
[14:01:29] p_l: phantomjs afaik runs a headless webkit or something like that
[14:01:45] p_l: I can already tell you that it behaves a bit different from webkit browsers :P
[14:02:17] brokenthumbs has joined #selenium
[14:03:56] AutomatedTester: wait... fragmentation in WebKit means they behave differently?
[14:04:02] AutomatedTester: colour me shocked
[14:04:17] riv_: :) ok ... i was trying to find out what benefit we get from doing headless testing apart from the tests running faster 
[14:04:57] AutomatedTester: riv_: only phantom runs faster from my experience
[14:05:13] riv_: AutomatedTester: i am lil confused.. headless is not functional testing?
[14:05:17] AutomatedTester: shoving the other browsers into XVFB makes them perform at the same speed
[14:05:26] p_l: well, I found the different behaviour in the way it didn't gobble my XSS envelope... ;)
[14:05:42] p_l: riv_: well, it can be functional, depends what you're testing :)
[14:05:51] p_l: also, you might want to do runs on real browsers anyway
[14:05:57] p_l: imvu's setup was most impressive
[14:06:09] raboof: AutomatedTester: phantomjs should be faster than i.e. firefox on xvfb right? IIRC a colleague of mine saw something like 30% speed increases
[14:06:49] AutomatedTester: riv_: functional testing is about testing the functionality of a site
[14:06:49] p_l: raboof: yes, but then you're testing the behaviour under PhantomJS, not Firefox
[14:06:56] raboof: (we currently run our selenium suites as part of our CI, we plan to switch to phantomjs for those and only do nightly builds with actual browsers)
[14:07:03] AutomatedTester: if it runs headless or not makes is irrelevant
[14:07:36] p_l: raboof: if you keep full browsert tests as well, all should be well
[14:07:47] riv_: p_l: i am using webdriver currently and i am getting a lil resistance to do tests with webdriver .... so if you are saying you might want to run tests on real browsers whats the advantage of that
[14:07:53] raboof: yeah, that's a sine-qua-none, but we'd like faster CI builds :)
[14:07:58] raboof: s/none/non
[14:08:07] AutomatedTester: riv_: as I said phantom is faster than firefox
[14:08:19] p_l: riv_: running tests on real browsers means that you actually tested the behaviour on that specific browser
[14:08:28] p_l: which is important given sometimes bizarre relationships
[14:08:35] AutomatedTester: riv_: if there is resistance to real browsers ask the devs how many users are using headless browsers
[14:08:38] *p_l has a page where Firefox fails to load any asset
[14:08:56] riv_: AutomatedTester: excellent point
[14:09:17] AutomatedTester: last time I checked the most sites had low phantomjs usage
[14:09:32] p_l: said page would probably work under phantomjs, even works with some browsers, but it seems the HTTP serving itself is borked enough to spook Firefox
[14:10:22] p_l: I still don't know how I get index page when asking for CSS file

[IRC logfile - Started Fri Mar 15 15:00:07 2013]
[15:00:07] intchanter-work: Minor changes, but they should be followed by more substantial ones as I get time.

[15:03:37] AutomatedTester: intchanter-work: tar
[15:03:51] farlan: thanks Ardesco, but I am interested in loading a different extension
[15:03:58] intchanter-work: Though some may have gone in with dfackrell at bluehost dot com.
[15:04:05] intchanter-work: tar?
[15:04:13] rasca1: What does By.ID mean in python examples at http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp
[15:04:39] rasca1: I am getting NameError: name 'By' is not defined
[15:04:48] intchanter-work: rasca1: It's the method by which it's searching for the elements.
[15:04:49] Ardesco: in that case i'm not aware of a way to load extensions on the fly
[15:05:04] intchanter-work: It can check by CSS, ID, XPath, and others.
[15:05:18] simonstewart has joined #selenium
[15:05:19] rasca1: intchanter-work: Why am I getting an error?
[15:05:21] Ardesco: although as it does it with the selenium extension it must be possible
[15:05:24] intchanter-work: Make sure you've imported the name By.
[15:05:38] intchanter-work: from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
[15:05:56] rasca1: intchanter-work: Which module is it imported from? selenium.webdriver.support?

[15:10:04] rasca1: intchanter-work: Thanks, that worked.
[15:11:10] rasca1 has left #selenium
[15:14:20] regex: jimevans: It doesn't compile.  Getting an issue with it.
[15:14:50] jimevans: well, first of all, it's got to be driver.Navigate().Back().
[15:15:08] jimevans: navigate is a method, not a property.
[15:15:10] mreedell-work has joined #selenium
[15:15:47] regex: jimevans: Okay.  I have it in a foreach.  
[15:16:50] jimevans: regex: some context might be useful. what are you trying to do, and what errors are you getting?
[15:17:54] jimevans: let me point out that if you're trying to call "FindElements()" to get all the links on a page, click on them to check their navigation, and use Navigate().Back() to go back to the page and click on the next link, that's never, ever going to work.
[15:18:22] *jimevans is exercising his psychic debugging powers today
[15:18:28] regex: jimevans: That's exactly what I am doing :) 
[15:18:49] jimevans: okay, settle in. i'm about to give a little lecture.
[15:18:57] regex: jimevans: Oh god.
[15:19:02] jimevans: think of the browser as a chalkboard.
[15:19:05] intchanter-work: jimevans++ for effective psychic debugging.
[15:19:16] *regex Gets pieces of chalk
[15:19:26] jimevans: and think of the DOM as the actual bits of chalk that make up the writing on the chalkboard.
[15:20:01] jimevans: when you do FindElements(), you're getting actual bits of chalk that are adhering to the chalkboard.
[15:20:28] regex: jimevans: But your hands get messy when handling chalk 
[15:20:39] jimevans: navigating in the browser, whether explicitly navigating, or by clicking a link, is akin to erasing the board, and writing everything on the next page all over again.
[15:21:07] jimevans: even if you go back, you're still erasing the board and rewriting the results of the previous page.
[15:21:26] regex: jimevans: Right.  I know that.  For example, I'm working with a single page application right now.  Using a JQuery framework on the front end.  Each view is independent of any URI 
[15:21:29] jimevans: the point is that it's *different* bits of chalk making up the writing after you navigate back.
[15:22:21] regex: jimevans: However.  I need to use the back feature to go back to the original URI.  So, if I build the 'ClickAllLinks' method with a parameter to the base URI everytime it goes BACK. 
[15:22:28] jimevans: every time the DOM refreshes, the elements (bits of chalk) are destroyed and recreated. this is particularly so when you call an explicit navigation method like "Back()"
[15:22:34] lukeis has joined #selenium
[15:22:52] dimacus: isn't it better to use a spider to check that all links, or maybe get all links in an array and run "wget" as a system call?
[15:23:23] dimacus: alsoâ€¦ 10x faster
[15:23:34] regex: jimevans: The MVVM model prevalent nowadays works with your context.  Eveyrtime a link is clicked, it's often just calling a controller method which sends the JSON or XML back into the view created by JavaScript.
[15:24:18] regex: dimacus: I used HTML Agility Pack too...but that's probably filth around here...
[15:24:46] jimevans: regex: but the javascript still is destroying and creating DOM nodes. which means that any references you had to actual DOM elements are now invaild,.
[15:24:56] jimevans: or invalid, even.
[15:25:17] regex: jimevans: Totally true.  So, I won't use the back persay.  I'll pass in a base URI customized for each time I use the method. 
[15:26:09] farlan1 has joined #selenium
[15:26:23] dimacus: regex: so are you trying to test a 1 page JS application, making sure each link provides proper ajax call and callback?
[15:26:27] jimevans: regex: okay, then i'm confused what the issue is. you mentioned that "driver.Navigate.back()" wouldn't compile.
[15:26:44] jimevans: i've given you the correct syntax that will make it compile.
[15:27:20] regex: jimevans: It doesn't compile even with 'Back()' 
[15:27:28] jimevans: but i'm also warning you that using driver.Navigate().Back() as part of a "find all the links, click each one to navigate, and go back to the 'all links' page in between" is doomed to failure.
[15:27:41] regex: 'Navigate is a method which is not valid in this context"
[15:27:45] jimevans: regex: are you using "driver.Navigate" or d
[15:27:50] jimevans: "driver.Navigate()"?
[15:27:58] jimevans: note the extra parentheses
[15:28:05] jimevans: they're important
[15:29:05] regex: jimevans: http://picpaste.com/pics/back-zdviL3Or.1363361725.jpg
[15:29:21] jimevans: also, what is the type of "driver"?
[15:30:10] jimevans: regex: as I said, it's "driver.Navigate().Back()". note the parentheses between the word "Navigate" and the period for "Back()"
[15:30:13] regex: jimevans: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5170734
[15:30:42] regex: dimacus: I could use sinon.js for that.  I'm not doing unit testing on that.  But, I'm just tesitng the integration part of it....
[15:31:05] jimevans: so i can get you past your compile error easily.
[15:31:19] jimevans: but what you're trying to do is going to fail. badly.
[15:31:28] regex: jimevans: You should let me buy you dinner by the wya.  Not sure why you won't. 
[15:31:57] jimevans: regex: what part of the world are you in? midwestern US?
[15:31:59] regex: jimevans: okay.  I'm eventually going to replace hte 'back' with a base 'URI' passed in.
[15:32:06] regex: jimevans: Minneapolis
[15:32:21] jimevans: regex: come to seconf in Boston in june. you can buy me a drink there. :)
[15:32:45] jimevans: anyway, you're getting a list of elements using FindElements().
[15:32:52] dimacus: jimevans: i think i'll buy you a drink just for the blackboard anology
[15:33:09] regex: jimevans: Can you buy my trip there?  How can I get that comped?
[15:33:28] jimevans: you want to click on each of them in turn, going back to the page where you found them in between, right?
[15:33:52] knorrium has joined #selenium
[15:33:58] jimevans: and here's the important point: that won't work. it just won't. full stop.
[15:34:02] dimacus: jimevans: can he just click on each link and open in new window, switch to window check content, close it?
[15:34:12] intchanter-work: regex: An alternative may work, though.
[15:34:18] Ardesco: why do you need to go to each page?
[15:34:19] jimevans: dimacus: theoretically, that might work, ues.
[15:34:25] jimevans: or yes, even.
[15:34:49] intchanter-work: If you go through and grab each element and get, say, the XPath that could be used to find that element again.
[15:34:56] jimevans: the point is to not remove the found elements from the DOM, which a page navigation would do.
[15:35:15] Ardesco: instead of going to each page I would suggest https://github.com/Ardesco/Powder-Monkey/tree/master/src/main/java/com/lazerycode/selenium/urlstatuschecker
[15:35:22] jimevans: or, re-find the next element in the list when you're ready to click on it
[15:35:26] intchanter-work: Then you could find the first by XPath, navigate to it, go back, find the second with XPath, etc.
[15:35:38] Ardesco: load the src attribute of every link into a list
[15:35:51] Ardesco: then iterate over the list pinging each url and getting an HTTP status code back
[15:35:55] Ardesco: simpels
[15:36:41] Ardesco: obviously you would need to convert the above into .NET
[15:36:52] Ardesco: but i'm sure there are libraries that do the heavy lifting for you
[15:37:01] Ardesco: concept is pretty simple
[15:37:10] jimevans: yep, if i was charged with just verifying that a list of links responded with valid pages, that's what i'd do.
[15:37:36] regex: Ardesco: That's exactly what I'd do by busing a Base URI.  I'd simply load all links.  Go back ot the base.  Click the next.
[15:37:49] jimevans: regex: but you're missing the key point here.
[15:37:53] Ardesco: but why are you navigating to the page
[15:37:59] Ardesco: what do you do when you navigate to the page?
[15:38:03] Ardesco: just go back?
[15:38:07] regex: jimevans: I heard you talk in that youtube clip.  That was cute ;) 
[15:38:20] Ardesco: if you just go back then what you are doing is pointless
[15:38:31] jimevans: regex: i'll be doing round two in june. :)
[15:38:41] dimacus: regex: on top of that, incredibly slow and flakey
[15:39:08] Ardesco: yup
[15:39:19] Ardesco: as you are finding out atm :)(
[15:39:31] dimacus: there is a reason most sites don't support the back button
[15:39:37] dimacus: your tests will fail randomly
[15:39:39] regex: jimevans: I've implemented Selenium on three projects in the Midwest.  Projects that are still ongoing today.  It's been an important part of my revenue stream.  I've made probably 50K in my career from just Selenium.  
[15:39:43] dimacus: and you will not be able to tell why
[15:40:19] jimevans: regex: well, i'm glad i was able to contribute in some small way, then.
[15:40:36] regex: dimacus: Ardesco:  So your argument is to make a request and get a status code 200 back for okay for each link instead of making the actual click? 
[15:40:44] dimacus: no
[15:40:50] Ardesco: may not always be a 200
[15:40:51] dimacus: i'd actually download the page
[15:40:57] dimacus: and see whats inside
[15:40:58] Ardesco: 3xx could be valid as well
[15:41:01] regex: jimevans:  Have you ever used Ranorex? 
[15:41:02] Ardesco: but basically yes
[15:41:41] Ardesco: it's faster less hassle and will give you exactly the same information
[15:41:42] Ardesco: or to put it another way, use the right tool for the job
[15:41:44] Ardesco: :)
[15:41:56] jimevans: regex: no, i've not used it.
[15:41:58] dimacus: and you will only be limited by your bandwidth
[15:42:09] dimacus: not by render time in browser each time you move between pages

[15:44:08] jimevans: kkania. i'll have to dig into that.
[15:44:10] kkania: jimevans: i was thinking perhaps this should be fixed on dot net side, or do you think the other way?
[15:45:05] jimevans: so i guess chromedriver2 requires you to pass the location of the chrome binary? or if i omit the capability will it use the default chrome?
[15:45:17] kkania: jimevans: yes, you'd have to omit it
[15:45:23] kkania: jimevans: like the java client
[15:45:54] jimevans: i didn't realize the java client did that. the .net bindings need to change.
[15:46:13] jimevans: if the capability is omitted using the old chromedriver, does it also use default chrome?
[15:46:18] kkania: yes

So 1 aproach, give ability to the grid to request that the slave does a killall IE

[16:33:03] jimevans: AutomatedTester: be glad to.
[16:33:06] AutomatedTester: since you were mid conversation
[16:33:08] BW^-: at its core, what is selenium?
[16:33:18] BW^-: a firefox "wrapper" written in Java?
[16:33:26] jimevans: BW^-: a browser automation library.
[16:33:39] BW^-: a understand Selenium exports the UI/DOM ofa  web browser to an API accessible by other processes
[16:33:44] BW^-: ah, is there OpenBSD support?
[16:33:46] BW^-: FreeBSD etc
[16:34:04] AutomatedTester: BW^-: if a browser works on those platforms it should work there
[16:34:19] BW^-: cool
[16:34:38] BW^-: so i just open X, and then the browser and then.. i ensure the Selenium plugin is lpugged in
[16:34:47] BW^-: and, i can concurrently interact via mouse and keyboard with the browser right?
[16:34:48] qatester: still having issue with safari with extensions

[16:37:07] BW^-: qatester: chrome works perfectly?
[16:38:52] qatester_ has joined #selenium
[16:38:55] BW^-: how does Selenium connect with the web browser, does Selenium's java process somehow run in the same OS process as the web browser?
[16:39:08] qatester_: chrome works fine.
[16:39:11] BW^-: or selenium has a custom plugin in the respective web browser, that it interfaces with a separate selenium osp rocess for?
[16:39:43] qatester_: System.setProperty("webdriver.safari.driver", (new File("/Users/usernamehere/Library/Safari/extensionnamehere.safariextz")).getAbsolutePath());
[16:39:43] qatester_: 			driver = new SafariDriver();
[16:40:24] qatester_: is use capabilities with chrome and runs fine.
[16:40:33] AutomatedTester: BW^-: assuming you are using Java, which is only 1 supported language, we start the browser with the necesary flags and have a webserver that takes commands from a client libary, that started the browser, and does IPC of sorts to the browser
[16:40:57] AutomatedTester: BW^-: we use the best approach for that browser
[16:41:23] AutomatedTester: BW^-: so the controlling code for IE is written in c++ while the controlling code for Firefox is written in javascript

[16:42:51] dawagner: Then I get to come home for a week! :D
[16:42:57] BW^-: the client libraries, are they "thin", and the real logics are done within this custom code in the respective web browser?
[16:43:06] AutomatedTester: BW^-: thats correct

[18:07:38] Revery: pageobjects is more of an idea (pattern) to create structure around your testing code to make it easier to maintain workflows as they change right?
[18:08:51] lukeis: yes, and to avoid duplication of locators / elements in testsâ€¦ your tests become pure test cases and your page objects end up handling all (or most) webdriver commands
[18:09:21] Revery: you can do some work when first code your selecting statements to make them more future-proof as well, like if your product uses randomized ids, maybe instead take the time to code a solid XPATH expression
[18:11:03] Revery: maybe you can find a link where the href attribute contains some string, or a nearby div is findable in a repeatable fashion and you know your element will always be a child or sibling of it

[18:16:30] BW^-: aha

[18:18:08] BW^-: is there any good way to select out the DOM elements that are *currently actually visible* in the web browser?
[18:18:16] BW^-: i.e. not overlapped, hidden etc
[18:18:52] Dude-X_: selenium works best if you try to do things on a specific element rather than on a global level
[18:19:09] Dude-X_: otherwise, it's a simple, get all elements, then check for visibility, then filter
[18:19:27] Revery: in your label case, i assume the input field is to the right? probably a sibling node?
[18:19:28] RandLAT has joined #selenium
[18:19:58] Revery: if it's something like: <div><label></label><input type="text"></input></div>
[18:20:08] Revery: then you can create an xpath selector that looks for a specific label
[18:20:13] Revery: and then finds the next sibling
[18:20:55] BW^-: is the firefox support full?

[18:21:30] BW^-: ok
[18:22:05] RandLAT: Having difficulties getting a WebElement or a link out of an xpath like "/table/tbody/tr[4]/td[1]/form/a" where the link's href is a "javascript:document...submit();" -- Does anyone know of a way to get to the link's real URL? Thanks in advance.
[18:23:27] Revery: it looks like that link most likely just submits the current form, can you check for the values on the <form> tag?   it's possible that javascript does the link creation/redirection in which case you're screwed
[18:24:52] llaskin: RandLAT: can you snippet your HTML into a :gist
[18:24:53] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[18:24:58] llaskin: perhaps I can help you define an element finder for it
[18:26:08] RandLAT: Well, clicking the link always gives the same result, so info about what's being clicked on is passed through other means than the URL, so I'm afraid the effectual link is of little value either.
[18:26:21] llaskin: so I'm confused by your actual question then
[18:26:32] llaskin: you're trying to get a webelement right?
[18:26:40] llaskin: so you have some HTML you are trying to run findElement against?
[18:27:09] llaskin: or are you trying to get the url of the link (attribute) from the <a> ?
[18:27:45] RandLAT: Reaching the link is fine, getting its .attribute("href") does give "javascript:document.formxxxxxx.submit();" 
[18:27:56] llaskin: right, and what are you trying to get out of it?
[18:28:00] RandLAT: So I guess I'm SOL heh
[18:28:56] RandLAT: It's been a while I experimented with actually clicking on a link, then "hitting" the Back button. I may have to look into that to actually visit the page, verify some info, and go back to the list of URLs
[18:29:14] BW^-: can you search for elemens by content?
[18:29:20] BW^-: as in, please give me all <b>OK</b> elements :)
[18:29:24] llaskin: sure
[18:29:28] llaskin: by xpath you can do that
[18:29:33] BW^-: which webdriver call is it for this?
[18:29:34] BW^-: aha

[18:30:02] BW^-: ah right
[18:30:13] BW^-: gr8 :)

[20:26:57] AutomatedTester: *shrug*
[20:27:04] AutomatedTester: sometimes py.test "helps"
[20:27:11] intchanter-work: Or maybe something else defined bytes?
[20:27:22] intchanter-work: I figured that would be a safe enough test.
[20:27:40] Dude-X_: 2.6 and 2.7 support bytes
[20:27:48] intchanter-work: Is bytes defined in Pdb there?  And if so, what is it?
[20:28:03] AutomatedTester: (Pdb) bytes
[20:28:03] AutomatedTester: <type 'str'>
[20:28:32] AutomatedTester: ahhh
[20:28:35] AutomatedTester: thats the problem
[20:28:48] AutomatedTester: lemme update the test then
[20:28:59] intchanter-work: So my try: didn't do what I needed.
[20:29:02] Dude-X_: i don't like that the assert uses an 'or'
[20:29:09] Dude-X_: why are we expecting two different outcomes?!
[20:29:36] AutomatedTester: there _was_ a reason
[20:29:38] intchanter-work: I'm not sure why, but I was trying to keep the current meaning of the test for these changes.
[20:30:00] *AutomatedTester admits writing a lot of the python webdriver code while sleep deprived and jetlagged
[20:31:40] intchanter-work: AutomatedTester: So we need to switch the logic.  Test for unicode, and move the renaming to the try: section.
[20:31:49] intchanter-work: except NameError: pass
[20:32:37] intchanter-work: As "unicode" goes away in python 3 in favor of str.
[20:32:48] AutomatedTester: ok
[20:33:12] intchanter-work: I'm checking for other instances that we should also change.
[20:33:48] intchanter-work: py/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py is the only other one.
[20:34:20] intchanter-work: We're also renaming in py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/firefox_profile.py, but its test is "from io import BytesIO".

[21:01:43] AutomatedTester: I think this one wont matter
[21:01:56] *AutomatedTester feels he changed the code and this test never failed
[21:02:18] Dude-X_: profile tests were the tests that failed for me in python 3 branch
[21:02:24] Dude-X_: i don't remember the fix
[21:02:24] BW^-: how do i make firefox open up a webdriver json API port for me manually?
[21:02:40] BW^-: as i got it, chrome needs a separate binary to enable webdriver and i'm not interested in looking into that now
[21:02:50] BW^-: so, if i could just do like firefox --webdriver=1234 that'd be great!
[21:02:52] BW^-: how do i? =)
[21:02:57] AutomatedTester: BW^-: why do you want to start it manually
[21:03:02] AutomatedTester: and not programmatically?
[21:03:39] BW^-: automatedtester: because i just want to make some manual json api calls in the wild!
[21:03:50] BW^-: so i don't have any access to any automatic starting!
[21:04:10] AutomatedTester: BW^-: there are a lot of hoops
[21:04:13] BW^-: could i install or run that xpi manually or something?
[21:04:19] BW^-: automatedtester: like what?
[21:04:45] AutomatedTester: well you need to get a webdriver.xpi, we dont publish it but it will be in the jar file _somewhere_
[21:04:48] AutomatedTester: install that
[21:05:07] BW^-: aha
[21:05:09] BW^-: and after this?
[21:05:12] AutomatedTester: then look for webdriver.json file and set those prefs
[21:05:28] AutomatedTester: shutdown firefox and start it up again
[21:05:33] BW^-: cool :)
[21:05:34] AutomatedTester: and it _might_ be ready
[21:05:46] BW^-: webdriver.json should be in firefox' user-local config directory?
[21:05:48] BW^-: hehe aha. :)
[21:06:07] AutomatedTester: BW^-: why not start it programmatically and then leave it on a break point
[21:06:10] AutomatedTester: and then do it that way
[21:08:03] qaguy has joined #selenium
[21:11:07] AutomatedTester: intchanter-work: those tests are pointless now so deleting them
[21:11:22] intchanter-work: Oh, the profile ones?
[21:11:36] AutomatedTester: yea, they are calling deprecated method
[21:11:53] *AutomatedTester should delete that method now
[21:12:00] intchanter-work: Awesome.
[21:12:00] AutomatedTester: right final tests
[21:12:15] AutomatedTester: how much did Dude-X_ help with your patch?
[21:12:50] intchanter-work: He had a full branch based on a previous repo, and I referred to it heavily in creating this one.
[21:12:59] intchanter-work: Many of the changes are straight out of it.
[21:13:04] AutomatedTester: ok
[21:13:16] AutomatedTester: he will get a mention in this
[21:13:24] AutomatedTester: credit where credit is due
[21:13:26] Dude-X_: we spoke about the changes; i didn't do str = unicode changes like intchanter-work though
[21:13:43] Dude-X_: the chrome code wrapper we will need to find out who wrote that though
[21:13:51] Dude-X_: but that needs to be tested
[21:13:57] intchanter-work: That's not part of this patch set.
[21:14:03] Dude-X_: oh
[21:14:07] intchanter-work: We can add it later.
[21:14:14] AutomatedTester: that the requests patch?
[21:14:15] intchanter-work: Once the necessary checks have been done.
[21:14:49] intchanter-work: No, a change Dude-X_ had that I didn't use, as he mentioned a possible CLA question.
[21:14:54] Dude-X_: no, the requests patch is different
[21:15:24] Dude-X_: if you look at my python3 branch from the old krose fork; i incorporated a 'monkey patch' of urllib
[21:17:44] AutomatedTester: Dude-X_: chromedriver2 isnt far away
[21:17:56] intchanter-work: https://github.com/Dude-X/Selenium2/commit/c3c494e7429802642e1ef9164db9f89eacb515d1 contains the changes Dude-X_ had before.
[21:18:15] AutomatedTester: so I would rather have a broken chrome build than not land it
[21:19:21] intchanter-work: I think the biggest difference in our work is that his was geared toward only Python 3 support, where mine attempts (maybe successfully?) to keep support for 2.6+ as well.
[21:19:58] intchanter-work: It was /very/ helpful to have it as a guide, so I'm in no way minimizing what he did.
[21:20:28] intchanter-work: And I plan to high-five him when this does land.  :-)
[21:20:41] AutomatedTester: intchanter-work: your name will be on the commit
[21:20:49] AutomatedTester: Dude-X_: will be in the message ;)
[21:21:12] AutomatedTester: i wont even add my name
[21:21:34] AutomatedTester: even though _I_ made it work...
[21:21:37] Dude-X_: intchanter-work, did you look at my python-23 brnach?
[21:21:39] AutomatedTester: :P
[21:21:51] intchanter-work: Heh.
[21:21:55] Dude-X_: you did the hard part of adding stuff to crazy fun :)
[21:22:12] intchanter-work: Dude-X_: I actually just noticed it while I was looking for the link from before.
[21:22:39] Dude-X_: oh...
[21:22:53] Dude-X_: that's why i was curious about the changes you made
[21:23:18] intchanter-work: If I can make time today, I'd love to see which approach you took.
[21:25:50] Dude-X_: IIRC, i added from __future__ import unicode_literals in some files, and then did some version checking for specific 'unicode' calls in python 2
[21:28:19] intchanter-work: Oh... there's a change we should probably include.
[21:28:31] Dude-X_: what's that?
[21:28:53] intchanter-work: In py/selenium/selenium.py, you recognized that it was the old RC interface and refused to provide Python3 support.
[21:29:02] intchanter-work: Instead of pass, I'd raise an error though.
[21:29:32] AutomatedTester: look, it works
[21:29:35] Dude-X_: alternatively you can make RC python 2.6 compliant
[21:29:38] intchanter-work: I'd hate to have people use Python 3 and RC, only to find themselves stranded.
[21:30:11] Dude-X_: if you're working on python 3, ideally you will be writing or porting web driver code, not RC
[21:30:22] intchanter-work: Any other changes in the  file can probably be kept.
[21:30:32] AutomatedTester: I doubt there are any py3 RC people
[21:30:50] intchanter-work: Yeah, I'd just like to safeguard against it happening by mistake.
[21:30:50] Dude-X_: as of now, RC supports python 2.5 code
[21:32:44] intchanter-work: AutomatedTester: py/selenium/selenium.py:22.  Can we add:
[21:33:22] intchanter-work: raise ImportError('Selenium RC is not supported with Python 3.  Please use the the webdriver interface instead')
[21:34:01] qaguy has joined #selenium
[21:34:31] intchanter-work: I'll want to do some cleanup there later, but that should be sufficient for now.
[21:35:14] intchanter-work: (just after line 22, that is)
[21:36:07] AutomatedTester: tbh, I am happy to revert all the RC code and put  a message
[21:36:31] vila has joined #selenium
[21:36:52] intchanter-work: That works too.  We'll just need a test to see if it's actually Python 3.  Maybe issue a deprecation warning under Python 2 instead.
[21:37:01] AutomatedTester: actually...
[21:37:04] Dude-X_: in my original branch I annotated things as "#fix" thats worth looking at because those are bugs i fixed
[21:37:16] AutomatedTester: I am tempted to leave it as is
[21:37:20] AutomatedTester: and see how many complain
[21:37:27] AutomatedTester: just so I can get stats 
[21:37:42] intchanter-work: That'll make for an interesting experiment.  :-)
[21:40:35] intchanter-work: I'm okay with that.
[21:43:08] Dude-X_: hey it looks like our collective work will make it in 2.32
[21:43:15] stephend: mmm, 2.32
[21:43:24] AutomatedTester: next python release is mine
[21:43:47] AutomatedTester: so people dont moan at lukeis, who has been my stand in while on paternity leave

[21:45:04] stephend: ah

[21:45:20] stephend: oh wow, cool

[21:46:08] stephend: guessing you're sarcastic, but I can't tell!
[21:46:31] AutomatedTester: the changes are were small but a lot of them
[21:46:44] AutomatedTester: Dude-X_: sorry for the typo
[21:46:55] Dude-X_: according to github, 10 months ago i did a lot of work for Python3, and some work for python2-3
[21:46:58] AutomatedTester: i am impressed I remembered properly
[21:47:21] Dude-X_: enchanter took the reigns to get this done and published
[21:47:32] Dude-X_: stop correcting my 'typos' Mountain Lion!
[21:48:11] intchanter-work: Heh.
[21:48:18] intchanter-work: I'm a typo!
[21:49:55] Dude-X_: it puts a space in webdriver 
[21:50:45] intchanter-work: Dude-X_: I've finished a review of that branch.  I didn't see anything else that looked like it was substantially different, though there's always a chance I missed something important.
[21:51:02] intchanter-work: Thanks for bringing my attention to it.

[22:29:55] Dude-X_: nice grab
[22:30:37] *Ardesco_H slaps regex 
[22:30:57] Ardesco_H: about to wander off to bed so I'll need the markup soonish if you want a working CSS locator
[22:30:58] Ardesco_H: :)
[22:31:07] regex: Ardesco_H: http://picpaste.com/css1-4EvlFokB.jpg
[22:31:22] AutomatedTester: they are brittle but nothing to worry about
[22:31:26] regex: Ardesco_H: http://picpaste.com/css2-Fe0RTp56.jpg 
[22:31:28] AutomatedTester: that can be sorted whenever
[22:31:45] regex: Ardesco_H: I highlighted the console where I did: $$("CSS"); 
[22:31:51] Dude-X_: AutomatedTester, this is the fix i wrote:  if str(type(self.driver)) == "class <'remote'>":
[22:32:29] Dude-X_: can't use isinstance because it will always be a remote driver
[22:32:32] regex: Ardesco_H: How do I get that homepage link with that as the pre:  $$("#content.main.container-fluid")  
[22:32:34] Ardesco_H: well the one you highlighted only needs to be
[22:32:46] Ardesco_H: $$("#content")
[22:32:53] Ardesco_H: unless you have invalid markup
[22:33:08] AutomatedTester: right bed
[22:33:11] AutomatedTester: XOXO all
[22:33:36] regex: Ardesco_H: That content is only the div.  I want to click that homepage link
[22:34:04] Ardesco_H: ok
[22:34:17] Ardesco_H: in http://picpaste.com/pics/css1-4EvlFokB.1363387071.jpg
[22:34:20] Ardesco_H: i don't see any id's
[22:34:26] Ardesco_H: so i would probably go with
[22:34:49] Ardesco_H: $$(".durandal-wrapper a")
[22:34:56] Ardesco_H: but i can't see the rest of the dom
[22:35:06] Ardesco_H: so i don't know what else that would match
[22:35:09] Ardesco_H: you could do
[22:35:14] regex_ has joined #selenium
[22:35:35] Ardesco_H: $$(".durandal-wrapper > section > div > ul > li > a")
[22:35:58] Ardesco_H: if you want something very very rigid that is likely to break as soon as the markup changes slightly
[22:36:02] Ardesco_H: again
[22:36:10] Ardesco_H: I don't know if that class is unique or not
[22:36:22] regex__ has joined #selenium
[22:36:27] Ardesco_H: so if that structure repeats you may well get multiple hits
[22:36:52] regex__: Ardesco_H: Can you show me that strucutre?  I just got disconnected
[22:36:55] Ardesco_H: doing locators with only a tiny bit of the markup visible sucks
[22:37:18] Ardesco_H: what was the last thing you saw
[22:37:40] Ardesco_H: in fact 
[22:37:41] Ardesco_H: :log
[22:37:41] selbot2: http://illicitonion.com/selogs/selenium/2013/03/15.txt | http://illicitonion.com/selogs/search
[22:37:57] Ardesco_H: look at that
[22:39:41] Ardesco_H: right time for bed
[22:39:41] Ardesco_H: gnite
[22:40:01] regex__: Ardesco_H: You are a genius
[22:40:05] regex__: how did you find that?
[22:40:14] Ardesco_H: find which ?
[22:40:18] Ardesco_H: the locator
[22:40:24] Ardesco_H: just by looking at the markup
[22:40:33] Ardesco_H: anyway good luck with it
[22:40:34] Ardesco_H: gnite
[22:41:02] regex__: Ardesco_H: yes, but how did you know hte section was next?
[22:41:25] *Ardesco_H pauses going again
[22:41:44] Ardesco_H: because you can see it in the markup
[22:41:52] Ardesco_H: the DOM is basically a tree that branches out
[22:42:13] regex__: Ardesco_H: Oh, you saw it with this: http://picpaste.com/pics/css1-4EvlFokB.1363387674.jpg
[22:42:20] Ardesco_H: so every extra indent is a child
[22:42:27] regex__: Ardesco_H: Because it was like section > div and so on.
[22:42:32] regex__: Okay, so that helps me going forward.  
[22:42:58] Ardesco_H: basically once you look at enough HTML, it's blindingly obvious ;)
[22:43:17] regex__: Ardesco_H: I just didn't know hte syntax for the > > blah 
[22:44:10] Ardesco_H: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html
[22:44:16] Ardesco_H: tells you everything you need to know
[22:44:52] regex__: Ardesco_H: I am illeratite.  
[22:45:26] Ardesco_H: than how do you know what i just said?
[22:45:26] Ardesco_H: :)
[22:45:28] Ardesco_H: gnite
[22:45:57] regex__: Ardesco_H:  Magic

[23:21:40] BW^-: where in the jar is the Firefox XPS?
[23:23:34] BW^-: ah
[23:23:39] BW^-: found it
[23:23:59] dawagner has joined #selenium
[23:28:06] BW^-: so now.. it' s installed.. what's the standard port it listens on?
[23:29:28] Dude-X_: 7055
[23:31:33] BW^-: dude-x_: thx. I get connection refused. do i need to start the firefox with any particular arguments for the webdrive to activate?    i doublechecked that the xpi is installed indeed. i did not install any .so files though, just drag and dropped the xpi into firefox and restarted.
[23:32:27] Dude-X_: firefoxbinary and firefoxProfile shows you all the changes done to start up Firefox
[23:33:02] Dude-X_: first it creates an anonymous profile with certain things disabled, and set, and it sets the extension, then it starts up firefox
[23:33:04] BW^-: dude-x_: url?
[23:33:15] Dude-X_: i don't have one handy
[23:33:17] BW^-: ok
[23:33:21] BW^-: is it in the .jar?
[23:33:36] Dude-X_: why not look at the source in googlecode?
[23:33:41] BW^-: ah

[23:33:48] Dude-X_: BW^-, what are you trying to do exactly?
[23:34:13] BW^-: dude-x_: just some manual JSON WebDrive Firefox access
[23:34:54] BW^-: aha found
[23:35:45] BW^-: what's the libibushandler.so for, not on windows i guess?
[23:37:49] Dude-X_: i suspect for native events support
[23:38:08] BW^-: dude-x_: what would that be about?
[23:39:30] Dude-X_: using the OS to click on stuff
[23:39:33] Dude-X_: or mouseover
[23:39:45] Dude-X_: by default it would use javascript to say "click"

[23:45:30] BW^-: dude-x_: i can't find in the sourcecode where it launches firefox.
[23:45:43] BW^-: dude-x_: do you have any clue of args or anything needed to make it start with opening a webdriver port?
[23:46:04] Dude-X_: the java code is a bit more complicated
[23:46:09] Dude-X_: take a look at the python source

[23:47:55] BW^-: ok
[23:48:09] BW^-: dude-x_: do you have any guess on which webdriver-enabled web browser runs best on OpenBSD?
[23:48:15] BW^-: firefox ought to be a pretty good pick wouldn't you think?
[23:48:25] Dude-X_: firefox has the best support
[23:48:31] BW^-: i see a mentioning in the xps' config file of freebsd, that it doesn't use some native stuff there,
[23:48:37] BW^-: so i guess it'll work out of the box on obsd
[23:48:39] Dude-X_: you need a GUI though or a virtual framebuffer
[23:48:39] detroniz_ has joined #selenium
[23:50:09] BW^-: dude-x_: you mean a running X instance. sure!
[23:50:23] Dude-X_: yeah

[23:53:24] BW^-: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/firefox_binary.py
[23:53:28] BW^-: hmm
[23:57:17] BW^-: dude-x_: any clue where those profiles are stored? seems there's a webdriver_firefox_port key  that i need to set
[23:57:25] BW^-: maybe i could just go to about:config or something as to set it there
[23:57:50] Dude-X_: firefox profile has the code for all the changes made
[23:57:57] Dude-X_: profiles are created programmatically
[23:58:02] Dude-X_: stored in a temp directory
