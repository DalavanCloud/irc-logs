[00:06:27] yoandy: can anyone provide an insight on the issue? 
[00:14:12] yoandy: is anybody around? 
[00:23:25] yoandy: latest news 
[00:23:25] yoandy: Zombies have taken over the world, trying to reach any and all survivors. selenium is the last hope for humans to test Zombie's symptoms. 
[00:23:26] yoandy: this message goes to anyone who is still out there
[00:26:04] p_l: yoandy: Brrraaaaainz
[00:27:11] yoandy: hahaha, so there are survivors 
[00:28:34] yoandy: so, have you read my previous posts? 
[00:30:26] p_l: unfortunately, I don't use that kind of setup, can't help you there
[00:30:35] p_l: only IE8 directly through IEDriver
[00:30:41] digismack has joined #selenium
[00:32:06] yoandy: ok, thank you anyway. appreciate your time. just for giggles, how are you handling clicking ? 
[00:39:34] p_l: right now I'm doing normal clicks, but we're still writing our test suite from scratch
[00:39:47] p_l: some bits of advanced actions because of weird JS in our pages
[00:40:32] ooo: p_l: Do you sometimes wish that developers would rewrite those instead of you having to wire up automation on them?
[00:41:08] p_l: ooo: we would happily rewrite that, but we have limited manpower and sometimes license issues
[00:41:18] p_l: in fact, we *ARE* fixing some of that
[00:41:25] ooo: p_l: License issues, I feel your pain.
[00:41:56] p_l: there's a big jar file to which we don't have source, and there's a completely opaque PL/SQL stuff in database
[00:42:11] p_l: neither can be modified due to losing support
[00:43:47] santiycr has joined #selenium
[00:44:15] yoandy: that is my main issue. the inconsistency of clicking using either Actions or just clicking the element or sending keys
[00:45:29] llaskin: woot
[00:45:48] icio has joined #selenium
[00:45:51] llaskin: yoandy: what's your issue?
[00:46:07] llaskin: aaah i see
[00:46:13] llaskin: yoandy: have you read about implicit and explicit waits?
[00:46:14] llaskin: that might be your issue
[00:46:26] llaskin: when seeing inconsistences like that it is usually not waiting long enoug before clicking it....
[00:48:02] yoandy: @llakin: im using implicit waits and it doesnt change the situation. 
[00:48:27] yoandy: using a timeout of 30 secs and a polling time of 500ms. 
[00:48:31] llaskin: and still nothing?
[00:48:36] yoandy: nothing 
[00:48:38] llaskin: can you :gist up some code?
[00:48:39] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[00:49:17] llaskin: I might not be able to help, but ca definitely look
[00:49:21] llaskin: also what language are you coding in?
[00:50:59] yoandy: java 
[00:51:03] yoandy: https://gist.github.com/yterradas/5087132
[00:51:16] yoandy: thank you very much for you help
[00:52:00] yoandy: when i debug i see selenium sending the click but the element never gets clicked on
[00:53:15] yoandy: like i said before there are plenty of blogs out there but it seems like temporary hacks that work sporadically depending on what you are using with no rhyme or reason 
[00:57:50] llaskin: why are you not using the classname search?
[00:58:43] phishy has joined #selenium
[00:59:17] llaskin: on line 3 and 4
[00:59:34] llaskin: also, what error are you seeing?
[00:59:39] yoandy: i was and it actually finds the element and clicks it every time but im trying to understand the problem because it happens in other places. besides the xpath is correct, it shouldnt fail on clicking
[00:59:55] llaskin: also for line 2, try this, it is better: WebElement element = webDriver.findElement(By.id("nvCrumbs").findElement(By.cssSelector("div > strong > a"));
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Mar  5 01:00:09 2013]
[01:00:09] llaskin: or do the entire thing by cssSelector
[01:00:11] llaskin: I hate XPATH
[01:00:31] llaskin: WebElement element = webDriver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#nvCrumbs div > strong > a"));
[01:00:33] llaskin: works too
[01:00:40] yoandy: i see a WaitTimeoutException because after clicking on the element it's supposed to take you to another page
[01:01:11] yoandy: ok. i dont know much of css. i will give a try that 
[01:01:31] llaskin: so it never takes you to that other page
[01:01:39] llaskin: net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize/
[01:01:39] yoandy: yeah
[01:01:41] llaskin: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize/
[01:01:44] llaskin: read that page to learn css
[01:01:46] llaskin: you will thank me.
[01:01:52] yoandy: thank you very much
[01:01:55] llaskin: the only thing you can't do in css is search for text() strings like you can with xpath
[01:02:02] llaskin: no more // bullshit.
[01:02:36] yoandy: yeah, xpath is not very readable in my opinion
[01:04:31] yoandy: @llaskin: when you said "webDriver.findElement(By.id("nvCrumbs").findElement(By.cssSelector("div > strong > a"));" is that actually looking in the children of  "nvCrumbs" or finding "nvCrumbs" and then finding the other element ? 
[01:04:47] llaskin: it looks in the children of nvCrumbs
[01:04:54] yoandy: aha
[01:04:56] yoandy: thank you 
[01:05:19] yoandy: i have been looking for someone to assert that but no luck until now
[01:05:50] llaskin: so when you findElement it returns an Element
[01:05:59] llaskin: Elements contain a method call findElement as well:)
[01:06:05] llaskin: also findElements which finds an array of sub elements....
[01:07:22] yoandy: i couldnt find anywhere in the docs an explicit answer saying that it wouldnt look in the whole DOM, just in the  children of the element
[01:07:51] yoandy: thank you very much for clarifying that. 
[01:07:58] llaskin: no problem:)
[01:08:28] llaskin: so why are you doing a Action click vs element.click in that if block?
[01:09:36] llaskin: also can I get an html snippet of the section you are trying to click in a :gist
[01:09:37] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[01:10:16] yoandy: Safari doesnt support moveToElement 
[01:11:01] llaskin: aaah ok.  I didn't know that.  not a safari user often....
[01:11:21] yoandy: me neither but i have to support as many browsers as possible
[01:11:41] llaskin: no problem, of course I get it.
[01:13:17] yoandy: ok, i will rewrite some of the tests with the suggestions you have given me. i really appreciate your time. i will back to impart my experiences. 
[01:13:55] llaskin: wait
[01:14:00] llaskin: i haven't really told you any suggestion how to fix your problem
[01:14:12] yoandy: well
[01:14:12] llaskin: i just gave you general formatting suggestions:)
[01:14:26] llaskin: does your test magically work all of a sudden?
[01:14:41] yoandy: dont you think that is the issue? 
[01:14:48] yoandy: i have not tested it 
[01:15:01] llaskin: no i don't think thats the issue
[01:15:08] llaskin: if it works sometimes but not others, thats def not the issue
[01:17:20] farlan has joined #selenium
[01:18:42] llaskin: can i get a :gist of some of the HTML you are testing?

[01:22:00] yoandy: @selbot2: https://gist.github.com/yterradas/5087132
[01:22:51] llaskin: selbot2 is a bot...he wants you to gist him some HTML as I asked....
[01:23:43] yoandy: @llaskin: how woudl you convert //*[@id="brandFacets"]/div/ul[2]/li[2]/a to cssSelector? i get the part of using  ">" for direct children access but how to ask for the second "ul" using ">" ? 
[01:24:03] llaskin: yoandy: can you :gist me an html snippet of that brandFacets piece?
[01:24:04] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[01:24:10] llaskin: I bet there are other ways to use a CSS selector to grab it....
[01:25:19] yoandy: i know that in css3 there is nth:child but it's not supported by IE7 
[01:25:30] llaskin: SE only supports css2 anyways
[01:25:31] yoandy: nor IE8 
[01:25:53] llaskin: again, i need html
[01:25:56] llaskin: or I can't really help you

[01:34:27] amitev2 has joined #selenium
[01:35:17] whatversion: there are many ways to locate elements for a webpage using chromedriver
[01:36:24] whatversion: but when I opened a web page, view page source, it only shows links to css and links to js (javascript). How can I use ChromeWebdriver to locate elements in this page without seeing the whole HTML tags?
[01:38:08] whatversion:  I'm looking for the input elements for username, password, and login button shown on the web page I can see. But I can't find these input elements at all on view page source.
[01:39:09] whatversion: can anyone help with this issue?
[01:40:17] llaskin: whatversion: can you :gist some code?
[01:40:18] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[01:40:22] llaskin: like your page source?
[01:40:38] llaskin: also you can try using a tool in firefox like firepath to find CSS or Xpath references for your code
[01:41:24] yoandy: right click on the element and inspect it 
[01:41:42] llaskin: yea you can do that, but that won't find you the exact reference.
[01:42:14] yoandy: you should be able to see css at the bottom of the page and also right clicking on the element while inside the inspector will give you a choice to Copy Xpath

[01:46:54] llaskin: thats all there is in the source?

[01:49:32] llaskin: ok
[01:49:33] llaskin: good luck
[01:52:37] whatversion: I think my question was why the view page source doesn't display input elements of username, password, login button whereas I can see on chome browser?

[01:57:10] llaskin: if its just a login page it must be publically available

[13:17:07] RaulFR: Manoj, in IntelliJ IDEA, I changedthe module settings under "Source - Language level" to 6.0, is that what you were suggesting ? The same error appears when I do that
[13:17:40] Manoj: check in the stack trace, whether it lists as Java version to be 1.6 or still the the same 1.7 
[13:20:49] ddary has joined #selenium
[13:22:50] RaulFR: no, the stack still lists 1.7, so I guess I'll have to download and install 1.6 jdk to test your suggestion
[13:26:48] RaulFR: FYI, I have been using Selenium 2.29.0 with Firefox 18.0.1 for weeks on this machine, developping my Java application using a Firefox profile to run the FF 18 version avoiding problems with updates, and using a normally updated release channel on my default profile
[13:27:51] RaulFR: this was using jdk 1.7

[13:33:23] RaulFR: I was using Eclipse for my development until this problem occurred. Then Ardesco yesterday suggested that maybe Eclipse was at fault, so I tried using IntelliJ IDEA, but same problems are manifesting there
[13:34:12] ryanpetrello has joined #selenium
[13:34:35] RaulFR: the problem does not seem Firefox related, since I tried using System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe"); WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); and I also get a "org.openqa.selenium.remote.UnreachableBrowserException" exception.
[13:35:14] RaulFR: if I try WebDriver driver = new HtmlUnitDriver(); no exception is reported by this line, but I can't do much with it :-)
[13:37:13] Manoj: well, that ridiculous to hear.... 
[13:37:16] Manoj: hmm

[14:37:12] nirvdrum: Not that this is helpful, but FF 17 is no longer supported by Selenium, unless it's FF 17 ESR.
[14:37:28] Ardesco: it's the ESR he's using 
[14:37:57] nirvdrum: Cool.
[14:38:27] Ardesco: I guess it means I'll have to try the ESR against that template and see if it works for me

[14:52:09] Ardesco: it sounds like webdriver-firefox-esr-previous.dll is expecting FF10 not FF17
[14:52:23] Ardesco: something AutomatedTester will probably have more idea about I would guess
[14:52:54] jimevans: RaulFR: the firefox extension that is installed into the anonymous profile contains embedded in it several native-code (i.e., written in c++) .dlls. these are used to provide so-called "native event" support to the driver. each .dll is compiled against a *specific* version of the gecko sdk, and will only work with a *specific* version of firefox. this is a limitation of firefox's extension architecture; there's no way around it.
[14:53:29] Ardesco: thinking about it, we run CI on Linux
[14:53:36] Ardesco: so we aren't using FF native events
[14:53:44] Ardesco: that may be why we haven't seen this
[14:56:03] jimevans: the binary components in the chrome.manifest file of the extension should be versioned with the appropriate application version, but i don't know if that wouldn't necessarily lead to a line in the firefox error console.

[15:41:05] supercom32: llaskin: Suppose for example you wrote some java code that performs a hardcoded set of actions, but you want to translate that code into a testcase someone can run. So you'd play back that java code and have selenium IDE record those actions. Is that possible?

[15:42:54] jimevans: millenium: All the method of the .NET ExpectedConditions class do is return a Func<IWebDriver, T> where T is either a bool or a nullable type.

[15:47:51] p_l: inj_Velev: look up Selenium 2, and various interfaces to it. Grokking one should be easy when you know C
[15:48:04] inj_Velev: Thanks :)
[15:49:02] jimevans: millenium: ExpectedConditions methods are intended to be used by WebDriverWait. they return anonymous methods with the specific signature. have a look at the ExpectedConditions sources (http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/dotnet/src/WebDriver.Support/UI/ExpectedConditions.cs) to see how they're implemented.
[15:49:42] millenium: jimevans thanks a lot I was looking for this page :)
[15:51:23] supercom32: llaskin: I guess Selenium IDE reads actions and events from the physical keyboard and mouse, and nothing that gets invoked code-wise?
[15:55:09] jimevans: supercom32: you already have selenium code, written in a "real" programming language (like java, ruby, python or c#), and you want to package that up for someone else to run? why would you need Selenium IDE, in that case?\

[15:59:41] llaskin: what is the style its currently written in?
[15:59:43] jimevans: supercom32: i don't know what "written in one 'style'" means. is it selenium code written in a "real" programming language, using either the selenium rc api, or the selenium webdriver api?

[16:04:49] supercom32: jimevans: Yes, it was written in Java code, and uses the 'driver' object.
[16:06:14] jimevans: supercom32: then why not just give the java code to the person you want to execute it? why bother with IDE at all? if they're not capable of running it from eclipse or intellij or similar, package it up as an executable .jar, and let them execute that.
[16:06:23] llaskin: yes why are you going to "backwards"?
[16:06:33] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[16:08:43] supercom32: @jimevans and @llaskin: Not getting into details, there is a requirement (Good or bad) that the test must be playable from Selenium IDE. 
[16:09:02] llaskin: the answer is "bad"
[16:09:07] supercom32: Thus, it must be recorded in Selenium IDE, so it can be played back. 
[16:09:10] llaskin: so you want to downgrade from java to selenese?
[16:09:52] supercom32: You'll have to trust me, but it's a little more involved than how it sounds. :-) 
[16:10:31] supercom32: But I was wondering if the re-recording concept would work. I mean, lets assume I use another automation tool and want to migrate over to Selenium. Could Selenium IDE read the other automation tool and re-author tests?
[16:11:48] intchanter-work: supercom32: I'm fairly new in this channel, but I'll recommend listening to the advice that you're getting.  These guys know what they're talking about.
[16:12:22] intchanter-work: It may be possible to do what you're thinking of doing, but it's the opposite of anything that would be considered progress.
[16:13:14] supercom32: I appreciate all the advice for sure. The concept is similar to doing this --> Say you automated everything using some Microsoft tool and you want to move your users over to the better Selenium code. How could you do it? 
[16:13:18] inj_Velev: Hey guys! Can I use something like "waitforclick"?
[16:13:42] supercom32: I would assume Selenium IDE would make it easy, since you could just record the MS tool's playback.
[16:13:52] jimevans: supercom32: sorry, i'm not going to be any further help, unless you can provide more in-depth reasoning behind your requirements, which seems rather arbitrary without further context.

[16:17:34] jimevans: supercom32: if your requirement was "i need these people to be able to run this automated code which was recorded in some microsoft tool", my advice would be the same. package it up as an executable, and let them run it. if your requirement is "i have this code recorded in some microsoft tool that needs to be translated into selenium", then my advice would be to manually translate it
[16:18:39] supercom32: jimevans: Thanks. I appreciate your advice. Not that I won't to that method, I just needed to know if that was even a possiblity or not.
[16:19:21] jimevans: i just can't get my head around "i *HAVE* to have people run this from selenium IDE".

[16:35:32] jimevans: manoj_: not exactly. i don't care at all about diagramming it. i'm analyzing the code base for how many classes depend on the base class, but it may not be a direct descendent; it might be several levels down the inheritance hierarchy.
[16:36:07] manoj_: open call Hierarchy, in Eclipse will do ? Not sure… though

[18:10:11] KaibutsuX: if I have a fixed position header on my webpage and some ele.send_keys() causes the page to scroll down a little, is it expected behavior that a screenshot will now show my header floating down the same amount of the scroll?
[18:11:29] jimevans: KaibutsuX: the answer, as with so many things in life, is "it depends."
[18:11:57] jimevans: how is the "fixed position header" implemented? is it continually repositioned to keep it at the top of the page using javascript
[18:11:57] KaibutsuX: jimevans: a simple fix is to call a method that does "window.scrollTo(0,0)
[18:12:07] KaibutsuX: nope, just top 0px
[18:12:28] jimevans: it also depends on how the browser renders it.
[18:12:36] KaibutsuX: but I don't know if that is a good idea to do before every single screenshot
[18:13:05] jimevans: oh, hang on. i see what you mean now.
[18:13:11] jimevans: brb
[18:13:46] dawagner: ohai maven :(
[18:14:23] lukeis: it should attempt to take a screenshot of the whole page without needing to scroll… but really depends on which browser you are using
[18:14:45] KaibutsuX: im in firefox now
[18:15:13] KaibutsuX: it does take the whole page, but if I'm currently looking at the bottom of a long page, then my fixed header is no longer at the "top" of the screenshot
[18:15:21] KaibutsuX: it's at the "top" of the current view
[18:15:35] manoj_ has left #selenium
[18:15:53] lukeis: isn't that how it's displayed to the user though?
[18:16:14] lukeis: do you not see that header in the top of the current window when scrolled to the bottom?
[18:17:27] lukeis: sounds like you do want your 'fix' of scrolling back to the top
[18:18:28] KaibutsuX: http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2prtytj&s=6
[18:18:59] lukeis: oddly enough, it sounds like webdriver is doing the 'right thing'
[18:19:05] KaibutsuX: haha
[18:19:23] KaibutsuX: I'm not saying it's not, it just seems weird in my instance
[18:19:24] lukeis: it's a real representation of how the page is being displayed
[18:19:55] KaibutsuX: so the entire page out of context of the visible screen could and will very well be displayed look weird
[18:20:10] lukeis: yes, likely
[18:21:39] KaibutsuX: well I think a better solution would just be to turn off the 'floating' header when in a test mode
[18:21:45] KaibutsuX: which I can do

[23:06:22] intchanter-work: There, that one properly has just the one intended commit.
[23:06:28] jarib: though if that was the case, they should be failing even if you passed `-r ...` on the command line
[23:06:44] jarib: we need to fix selbot2 to ignore github notifications
[23:08:37] intchanter-work: Where is that running?
[23:09:02] jarib: selbot2? on my server
[23:09:27] intchanter-work: I was curious if I might be able to help with that modification.
[23:09:35] intchanter-work: What language is it written in?
[23:09:37] jarib: ruby
[23:09:42] jarib: check jarib/selbot2 on github
[23:10:13] jarib: shouldn't be too hard to ignore the nick of the other bot
[23:10:54] intchanter-work: I am moderately weak in ruby, but will make an attempt.  :-)
[23:12:24] jarib: jimevans: could you try printing the paths like this? https://gist.github.com/jarib/855341490e0ca0f2400e
[23:12:46] jarib: and give me the full output when it fails?
[23:13:10] jarib: ruby should be smart about / vs \ for require calls
[23:13:18] jarib: maybe jruby isn't
[23:13:30] jimevans: wait a tick.
[23:14:08] jimevans: yeah okay i see what's happening now.
[23:14:43] jimevans: it's the require 'childprocess' in mappings/android.rb that's giving us fits. 
[23:14:58] jarib: that shouldn't be a problem if the jar is loaded
[23:15:12] jimevans: okay. wait one, then.
[23:15:29] jarib: requiring childprocess.jar just sets everything up so require "childprocess" will work
[23:15:32] intchanter-work: jarib: Looks like (?!Selenium-Git) at the start should do it.  Sound right?
[23:16:04] jarib: intchanter: no, i think you need to look at message.nick
[23:16:24] jimevans: jarib: well, that's what's not working. printing the path to the jar points to the proper albacore.jar and childprocess.jar.
[23:16:33] jarib: hm
[23:16:59] intchanter-work: Oh, that's even easier.
[23:17:30] jarib: without checking the code it's probably just `return if message.nick =~ /whatever/` at the top of the method
[23:17:46] intchanter-work: IGNORED_NICKS is set, so I can just add it there.
[23:17:51] jarib: ah, cool
[23:17:56] intchanter-work: Is - special in %w[] ?
[23:17:59] dawagner: santiycr: So did you stop doing the heuristic guessing of which hosts/ports to proxy?
[23:18:07] intchanter-work: Or will it be treated as a word character?
[23:18:08] jarib: intchanter-work: i think only space
[23:18:22] markalanevans has joined #selenium
[23:18:30] jarib: intchanter-work: yeah, - is good
[23:18:43] jarib: %w[foo-bar baz] #=> ["foo-bar", "baz"]
[23:18:57] intchanter-work: Perfect!
[23:19:16] jarib: jimevans: java -jar third_party\jruby\jruby-complete.jar -r ./third_party\jruby\gems\childprocess.jar -e 'require "childprocess"'
[23:19:20] jarib: does that fail for you?
[23:19:36] jarib: oops, missed ./
[23:19:49] jarib: but you get the idea.
[23:20:21] jarib: thanks!
[23:20:26] intchanter-work: yw  :-)
[23:20:36] intchanter-work: Here's hoping it was really that simple.
[23:20:43] jarib: we'll find out
[23:20:50] jarib: within 30 minutes 
[23:20:52] jimevans: jarib: that fails, yes.
[23:21:07] jimevans: oops.
[23:21:14] jimevans: nvm. let me try that again.
[23:22:09] jimevans: it fails, but not because it couldn't find the jar. i get "-e:2: unterminated string meets end of file"
[23:23:22] jimevans: jarib: here's my backtrace when running go.bat: https://gist.github.com/jimevans/5095343
[23:23:22] jarib: and you got the quotes right there?
[23:23:54] santiycr: dawagner: We set browsers to proxy absolutely every request, though it can be tricky with things like localhost
[23:24:03] jarib: ok, so requiring the jars doesn't fail
[23:24:10] santiycr: for that, we actually have a server listening on legit localhost and working as a relay

[23:32:29] jarib: jimevans: thanks for the help, i'll get my hands on a windows machine at work tomorrow and get to the bottom of this
[23:32:35] jimevans: ok
[23:32:54] jarib: jimevans: how hard is it to set up enough deps to get dotnet building?
[23:33:17] jimevans: not that bad. you just need the .net framework installed.
[23:33:26] jimevans: (and the directories added to the path)
[23:33:27] jarib: and build tools?
[23:33:50] jimevans: the raw .net framework comes with all of the required pieces to build the .net bindings.
[23:33:57] jimevans: or should.
[23:34:03] jarib: ok, cool
[23:34:29] jimevans: have a look at https://github.com/jimevans/windows-selenium-dev-setup/blob/master/go.cmd
[23:34:39] jarib: ooh, shiny
[23:35:14] jimevans: once you've downloaded the installers for .NET 3.5 and 4.0, you can use the command lines from line 15 and 18 of that script to install.
[23:35:35] jimevans: (%~dp0 means "current directory")
[23:35:47] jarib: omg, is that permanently updating an environment variable from a batch script?
[23:36:14] jarib: i know someone who's going to love that :)
[23:36:24] jimevans: jarib: it is. but you need to elevate to get it to work.
[23:36:32] jarib: that's fine
[23:36:41] qaguy has joined #selenium
[23:36:44] jimevans: because it's writing to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
[23:36:50] jarib: it's still a lot better than doing it through the control panel
[23:37:17] jimevans: i got tired of having to remember where everything was when i set up a new vm.
[23:37:41] jarib: yeah, very cool
[23:38:00] jarib: i just started using http://boxen.github.com/
[23:38:11] jarib: had to wipe my work machine, so decided to give it a shot
[23:38:56] jimevans: cool. good to know.
[23:39:50] jimevans: one of these days i'm going to parameterize the download script to take an input file, but batch language text file processing is incredibly brain-dead.
[23:40:03] jarib: i can imagine
[23:40:09] jarib: what about powershell?
[23:40:17] intchanter-work: Do we have a craigds here?
[23:40:31] jarib: :seen craigds
[23:40:31] selbot2: I haven't seen craigds.
[23:40:43] tim13o has joined #selenium
[23:41:00] jimevans: powershell is much nicer, but i wanted the smallest bootstrap possible. since i occasionally set up xp machines (the IE6 app compat vm), i can't really use powershell.
[23:41:17] jarib: right
[23:41:26] jimevans: which reminds me. i can get rid of the svn client install.
[23:42:20] tim13o: hey guys, just wondering if anyones iphone emulator working after 2.30? 
[23:47:46] nullx: tim13o: I would bet that their hudson thing has extensive tests on the iphone part
[23:47:53] nullx: but I can't say I know it
[23:48:20] nullx: probably though
[23:48:44] jimevans: lukeis: didn't you just push up a fix for the iPhone driver?
[23:49:04] lukeis: that was if you used iphone driver through Se Grid
[23:49:19] lukeis: otherwise, iphone is working just fine for me

[23:51:00] lukeis: nullx: we don't have Selenium tests running in our Jenkins against iPhone currently
[23:51:13] lukeis: 'our' == the selenium project
[23:51:33] tim13o: oh thanks lukeis, I replied to that thread, and didn't realized there was responses.
[23:51:58] lukeis: i did just re-run them yesterday and got a (fairly) successful result (the selenium tests that is)
