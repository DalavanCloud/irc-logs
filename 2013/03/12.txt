[16:35:27] simonstewart: intchanter-work: other languages in crazyfun.j?
[16:35:38] simonstewart: I'll add them as i need them, or others will add them
[16:35:58] sfbrian has joined #selenium
[16:36:07] simonstewart: intchanter-work: but is it worth it?
[16:36:28] simonstewart: Would it just be better to throw away the thing that's there now and do it properly?
[16:36:39] simonstewart: I genuinely don't know the answer to that
[16:36:45] lukeis: https://github.com/Gazler/githug  was a good / fun exercise… i even learned something :)

[16:40:01] tim13o has joined #selenium
[16:40:32] lukeis: yep
[16:40:42] intchanter-work: How many exercises?
[16:41:16] simonstewart: "git add -e"?
[16:41:36] lukeis: you can edit the things you're going to stage, so you can stage a partial diff
[16:41:59] intchanter-work: Ooh, shiny!
[16:41:59] lukeis: in the example you add two lines to a file, but you only want to stage one line
[16:42:19] simonstewart: That sounds like a really, really great idea

[16:54:59] Dude-X_: simonstewart, do you use Oracle Java or OpenJDK java when running tests or developing Selenium?
[16:55:32] simonstewart: Oracle java 7 on OS X
[16:55:51] Dude-X_: alright i guess i'll use Oracle Java in ubuntu then
[16:56:09] simonstewart: It shouldn't make a difference
[16:56:21] Dude-X_: it fails to run smallTests
[16:56:23] lukeis: intchanter-work: i think there was 31? or maybe 41? dunno, and I already deleted / remove the thing from my system (and I failed the last step ;) )
[16:56:55] Dude-X_: I think barancev saw a difference between using official java and the free one
[16:56:59] intchanter-work: Cool, that gives me an idea how much might be left.  I'm on 30.
[16:57:15] simonstewart: Dude-X_: We should probably work with open jdk too :)

[17:13:08] pbramos: Has anyone been able to get Selenium to run PhantomJS using selenium-webdriver?
[17:13:14] pbramos: I can't seem to get it to work
[17:13:45] lukeis: what language are you using?
[17:14:03] lukeis: and what seems to be the problem?
[17:14:36] detronizator: pbramos shoot
[17:15:06] pbramos: I'm using NodeJS
[17:15:08] lukeis: hiya detronizator didn't see ya here ;)
[17:15:19] detronizator: lukeis: hi dude
[17:15:29] detronizator: pbramos, so you are using webdriverjs
[17:15:30] detronizator: right?
[17:15:30] pbramos: let me put the stack trace into a pastebin
[17:15:45] pbramos: Well, I'm actually using selenium's official "selenium-webdriver"
[17:15:53] pbramos: I tried using webdriverjs, but that didn't work
[17:16:06] pbramos: Though I think it wasn't working because I was using an outdated version of PhantomJS 
[17:16:17] detronizator: selenium-webdriver? in NodeJS? is there another Node module?
[17:16:18] lukeis: pbramos: link to what you are calling the official one please?
[17:16:22] pbramos: However, I've since updated to the latest PhantomJS, and to selenium-webdriver, with no luck
[17:16:47] pbramos: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs
[17:17:08] lukeis: ok webdriverjs :)
[17:17:19] admc has joined #selenium

[17:19:15] pbramos: Will a pastebin of the stack trace be helpful?
[17:19:18] detronizator: 2 different projects
[17:19:21] pbramos: right

[17:23:23] detronizator: so
[17:23:28] detronizator: are you using Selenium Grid?

[17:26:50] jimevans: ZOMG! i may be on the verge of being able to remove the IEDriverServer.exe dependency on ATL.
[17:26:55] detronizator: pbramos: ok, so did you 1) install phantomjs somewhere 2) where? 3) did you add it to the "$PATH"? 4) or, have you passed path to it via Capabilities?
[17:27:03] lukeis: jimevans: whoooaaah
[17:27:19] jimevans: lukeis: i know, right?
[17:27:22] pbramos: detronizator: Yes.  I've installed it globally using NPM.  It's accessible anywhere
[17:27:23] detronizator: jimevans: WHATTT?
[17:27:34] detronizator: u have installed what?
[17:27:39] detronizator: phantomjs?
[17:27:41] KaibutsuX: that is awesome jimevans
[17:27:43] pbramos: detronizator: Yes
[17:27:50] detronizator: phantomjs via npm?
[17:27:55] detronizator: that doesn't sound right
[17:28:02] pbramos: Why not?
[17:28:18] jimevans: theoretically, that would mean that IEDriverServer could be build with Visual C++ Express Edition. which would rock.
[17:28:24] pbramos: I'm just passing it by name to "capabilities" and it actually seems to run it, but then fails
[17:28:53] detronizator: the npm package "phantomjs" downloads phantomjs for you?
[17:28:59] lukeis: https://npmjs.org/package/phantomjs
[17:29:00] pbramos: detronizator: Yes
[17:29:11] lukeis: node kids and their npm ;)

[17:29:30] lukeis: :)
[17:29:45] detronizator: let me go throught the stacktrace again...
[17:30:10] lukeis: stack trace looks like the browserName is not getting passed in through the desiredCapabilities
[17:30:35] rananda has joined #selenium
[17:30:36] detronizator: https://npmjs.org/package/selenium-webdriver
[17:30:39] *lukeis does not know the javascript bindings at all to help with an example
[17:30:42] detronizator: sorry, wrong paste
[17:31:02] detronizator: which capabilities are you setting?
[17:31:14] pbramos:    .withCapabilities({'browserName': 'phantomjs'})
[17:31:44] detronizator: you might also need to pass the capability 
[17:31:50] detronizator: with the path to phantomjs executable
[17:32:12] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[17:32:29] detronizator: "phantomjs.binary.path"
[17:32:34] detronizator: is the capability
[17:33:20] lukeis: oh yeah… that looks more like the issue "	Timed out waiting for driver server to start."
[17:35:15] pbramos: What are the other keys of that hash?  I don't see a list in the docs
[17:35:15] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[17:36:06] detronizator: what do tou mean>?
[17:37:16] pbramos: The hash that is passed to withCapabilities()
[17:37:33] lukeis: not well documented… you can look at https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/blob/master/binding/java/src/main/java/org/openqa/selenium/phantomjs/PhantomJSDriverService.java
[17:37:34] pbramos: Or do I pass the path to "browserName" ?
[17:37:52] detronizator: well, they are not documented on a wiki page yet
[17:37:53] detronizator: https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/blob/master/binding/java/src/main/java/org/openqa/selenium/phantomjs/PhantomJSDriverService.java
[17:38:00] detronizator: I get them from here
[17:38:08] detronizator: as I don't trust my own memory
[17:38:17] detronizator: I'll soon provide a Wiki page that gives those info
[17:38:18] detronizator: :P

[17:39:21] qaguy: hey guys. I'm looking to hire a QA engineer to work for me. if anyone knows someone who might be interested, ping me and I'll provide details. Good place in NYC. Would be working on mobile automation.
[17:41:24] phishy has joined #selenium
[17:41:53] pbramos: Interesting
[17:42:21] pbramos: Providing the path worked 
[17:42:36] lukeis: w00t ;)
[17:42:44] pbramos: I had to link directly to the .cmd, since I"m on windows
[17:43:05] lukeis: ah, that's why the server couldn't find it
[17:43:10] pbramos: So like... /users/pramos/AppData/Roaming/npm/phantomjs.cmd
[17:43:14] lukeis: normally looking for the .exe
[17:43:19] pbramos: Weird thing is, that is IN my path
[17:43:22] pbramos: right
[17:43:31] lukeis: it's not looking for '.cmd'
[17:43:43] lukeis: so even if it was in the path it won't find it
[17:43:54] lukeis: raise a bug with the npm bundling people?
[17:44:15] pbramos: I think this is more a selenium issue?
[17:44:18] detronizator: yes, I agree with lukeis
[17:44:19] lukeis: or is the .cmd just a shell script that finds the .exe?
[17:44:23] pbramos: It should just reference "phantomjs" and not "phantomjs.exe"
[17:44:30] lukeis: it does both of those
[17:44:34] pbramos: hm
[17:44:34] lukeis: you have .cmd ;)
[17:45:10] lukeis: is the .cmd the actual binary?
[17:45:19] pbramos: I don't believe so
[17:45:28] pbramos: No, it's a script
[17:45:37] lukeis: if you find the binary and get that on the system path, it will 'just' work
[17:46:45] pbramos: well, I appreciate the help guys
[17:46:56] lukeis: glad you got it working

[18:50:21] Guest60385: eanxgeek: I am using the webchat.freenode.net, and I cannot figure out how to get something other than GuestXXXX?
[18:50:29] intchanter-work: Guest60385: How did you connect?  Most IRC clients support the /nick command.
[18:50:38] intchanter-work: "/nick <new_nickname>"
[18:51:29] lukeis: Guest60385: you need to pick a nickname that isn't already registered
[18:51:47] Guest60385: intchanter-work: I am new to this. I have two options to connect i.e. the Web Client at webchat.freenode.net & ChatZilla
[18:52:01] lukeis: looks like O_O is taken
[18:52:19] Guest60385: Lukeis: Is there a way to figure out what is registerd and what isn't?
[18:53:00] intchanter-work: Guest60385: Either client should work fine.  There are other options that you may want to evaluate if you find yourself doing a lot of IRC.
[18:53:10] Guest60385: lukeis: Is there some kind of Web Interface where we can register our nicknames?
[18:53:12] lukeis: "/msg nickserv info <nick>"
[18:53:25] lukeis: you have to 'chat' with nickserv
[18:56:01] Guest60385: lukeis: I am attempting to do a "/msg NickServ register <password> <useremail> and it tells me my nick is reserved and cannot be registered?

[18:56:58] pbramos: Does anyone have experience with WebDriver in here?

[18:57:24] lukeis: pbramos: docs exist… maybe not for JS
[18:57:31] pbramos: By webdriver, I mean "webdriverjs"
[18:58:38] detronizator:  pbramos - WebDriverJS, that you use
[18:58:50] detronizator: it's an "unofficial" webdriver implementation
[18:58:57] detronizator: who makes the binding should provide the doc
[18:59:02] detronizator: that said
[18:59:07] lukeis: the npm one is official selenium-webdriver
[18:59:12] pbramos: Is there an "official" one with good docs? :)
[18:59:19] pbramos: lukeis: I was under the impression that was the case
[18:59:19] detronizator: I'm pretty sure it has access to cookies
[18:59:35] lukeis: https://npmjs.org/package/selenium-webdriver is official ;) jleyba did it
[18:59:36] pbramos: I thought the function was getCookies(), but that's not working
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Mar 12 19:02:25 2013]
[19:02:25] pbramos: I'm sure this has been asked 1,000 times, but why doesn't Selenium just give me 1:1 access to the DOM?
[19:02:26] lukeis: pbramos: driver.manage().getCookies()
[19:02:46] lukeis: you can do that with execute_script
[19:02:48] pbramos: Wouldn't it make things simple if I could get a proxy to it
[19:03:00] lukeis: err, executeScript
[19:03:07] pbramos: So driver.execute_script("document.cookie") ?
[19:03:17] OiO: Thank you lukeis :-)
[19:03:23] lukeis: driver.executeScript("return document.cookie")
[19:03:30] pbramos: Cool stuff

[19:10:25] detronizator: there should never be such stupidity
[19:10:25] detronizator: OR
[19:10:39] detronizator: 1 of them should implement it 100%, document the fuck out of it and rule them over
[19:10:40] lukeis: everyone likes to make their own? :)

[19:41:50] AutomatedTester: barancev: simonstewart said I can implement it the way I think as long as I make it work in IE6

[19:45:32] AutomatedTester: :)
[19:46:15] barancev: AutomatedTester: I'm neutral. I just want it to be 1) documented, 2) cross-browser compatible
[19:46:30] AutomatedTester: barancev: agreed
[19:47:04] AutomatedTester: barancev: I think the implementation is fine except for boolean attributes and then it muddies the water
[19:47:53] AutomatedTester: barancev: I will speak to simonstewart about it again tomorrow because since it "must work in IE6" for the spec raises a very interesting point
[19:47:54] barancev: yes, boolean attributes are pita
[19:48:22] barancev: IE6 and IE7
[19:48:27] AutomatedTester: yea
[19:49:48] AutomatedTester: should the spec have its behaviour influenced by browsers that have been EOL
[19:50:08] AutomatedTester: I can see the OSS project being fine with that but browser vendors might have a different idea
[19:50:58] AutomatedTester: its not EOL but you know what I mean

[20:43:16] Baygon: Anyone to help me with an issue with Selenium RC ?
[20:43:30] OiO1: Does anyone know how to get the port number a FireFoxDriver() starts on? (I am using C# on Win 7 64 bit)
[20:46:01] Baygon: I'm storing text on a polish website : String htmlcontent = selenium.getHtmlSource() ;  but some special polish letters are stored as "?"... any idea how to fix that or how to retrieve the texts in another way ?
[20:47:22] OiO1: My question was after starting the FireFoxDriver() constructor, to get the port number? I have two Solutions/Projects. One my regular Solution where I cannot get the driver to start up, and another a new Project/Solution where this works. I am trying to debug this problem
[20:51:48] Dude-X_: it uses 7055 and 7056, always
[20:51:58] Dude-X_: or rather 7054. and 7055 on firefox
[20:53:15] OiO1: Dude-X_: Thank you. I am trying to figure out why the same code works in a New Solution/Project C# Visual Studio, but does not work in an Existing larger Solution

[21:00:15] OiO1:  Dude-X_: I get FireFox to open in the larger Solution. However I with the current vanilla release I get the error "An address incompatible with the requested protocol was used [::1]:7055"
[21:01:03] Dude-X_: oh IP4 versus IP6 issues
[21:01:09] Dude-X_: jimevans would know more about that
[21:01:17] OiO1: This is related to issue https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4629 - Which thankfully Jim fixed
[21:01:21] lukeis2 has joined #selenium
[21:01:51] OiO1: Yes, I am hoping to get Jim here :). He was helping me yesterday, but then he had to leave
[21:02:23] Dude-X_: that was fixed yesterday according to the issue
[21:02:32] Dude-X_: so you may have to wait for the next release (2.32)
[21:02:41] Dude-X_: or 2.31.x for .NET
[21:02:51] jimevans: i'm here now. but i don't know what else i can offer. it's very clear what's happening, that the firefox extension isn't properly listening on the port, but i'm not an expert in the internals of the firefox driver, so i can't tell what may be the issue ther.
[21:03:05] lukeis has joined #selenium
[21:03:22] jimevans: Dude-X_: OiO1 has patched the code on his end, and is building his own bindings.
[21:03:39] OiO1: jimevans: But then why doesn't the issue happen with the new Solution/Project?
[21:04:05] Dude-X_: most likely a difference in environment
[21:04:35] jimevans: sorry, I'm in the middle of some tricky code that i really need to pay attention to.
[21:04:35] OiO1: Dude-X_: You may be right, but I am trying to figure out what the difference is

[21:06:07] jleyba has joined #selenium
[21:06:36] Dude-X_: Firefox 17 may or may not work with the latest selenium, so long as you're not using native events; 
[21:07:23] qaguy has joined #selenium
[21:07:24] OiO1: Dude-X_: I am just using the FireFoxDriver() constructor and the driver.Navigate(). Are these native?
[21:07:50] jimevans: Dude-X_: firefox 17 is pretty much guaranteed to work for the next good long while. it's the latest ESR release.
[21:08:04] Dude-X_: That's right….
[21:08:10] OiO1: jimevans: Thank you Jim
[21:08:28] Dude-X_: native events has to do with OS clicking links or using the browser's javascript to click links
[21:08:40] Dude-X_: i don't know what the default is on Windows
[21:08:48] Dude-X_: typically it's disabled in Linux and Mac
[21:09:26] OiO1: Dude-X_: Right now I am having a problem with the code getting stuck in the FireFoxDriver() constructor i.e. it does not get beyond that point
[21:10:50] Dude-X_: the way web driver works
[21:11:03] Dude-X_: is that it starts firefox to create a new anonymous profile in your temp directory
[21:11:11] Dude-X_: then it shutdown and starts firefox again with that new profile
[21:11:41] Dude-X_: one of these parts is failing
[21:12:38] OiO1: Dude-X_:  Yes this firefox profile gets created and starts up. In this FireFox profile directory, I understand that an extension is installed to communicate on a particular port. For some reason this communication goes through in the new Solution, but does not work in the larger solution
[21:13:11] jimevans: OiO1: you're using the same WebDriver.dll assembly in both the "old" and "new" solutions?
[21:14:14] OiO1: jimevans: As far as the vanilla version of the latest release is concerned, yes. However for the old solution I have also substituted my custom Webdriver.dll
[21:16:36] OiO1: jimevans: With the patch to restrict IPv4, I get the error "No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it 127.0.0.1:7055"
