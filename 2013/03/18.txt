[14:30:41] AutomatedTester: jimevans: you never replied to my Korean War comment
[14:30:53] AutomatedTester: do you think that was a war that met the criteria?
[14:31:03] jimevans: AutomatedTester: you're right. i got distracted. :)
[14:31:11] jimevans: i'm not entirely sure.
[14:31:30] AutomatedTester: jimevans: its a grey area
[14:31:46] AutomatedTester: since that was UN led and UN forces were US led
[14:31:51] AutomatedTester: just like the Gulf war
[14:32:15] AutomatedTester: so if Korean War doesnt fit we may need to remove Gulf War
[14:32:20] AutomatedTester: food for thought
[14:32:25] jimevans: it is food for thought.
[14:32:58] jimevans: i confess i've not studied the history of the korean war as closely as the other US military conflicts post-WWII.
[14:33:11] jimevans: so i'm not certain what the objectives as defined were.
[14:33:40] AutomatedTester: for Korean war it was "repel North Koreans and Chinese back past the 38 Parallel
[14:33:41] AutomatedTester: "
[14:33:42] jimevans: the conflict ended up as "push back to the 38th parallel", but was that the defined goal at the time of engagmenen?
[14:33:54] AutomatedTester: I believe so
[14:34:06] AutomatedTester: I am totally open to correction though
[14:34:20] jimevans: yeah, i really don't know.
[14:34:38] jimevans: i'm a student of history, but only a middling one. :)
[14:35:04] AutomatedTester: the only history that has interested me is where there were interesting wars
[14:35:26] AutomatedTester: The British have some interesting things there
[14:35:53] jimevans: true that.
[14:36:19] AutomatedTester: e.g. Who created Concentration camps first? British or Germans
[14:37:08] jimevans: the brits have some 1700+ years to have interesting conflicts before the US was even started. :)
[14:37:29] jimevans: errâ€¦ 700+
[14:38:20] jimevans: (basing my dates from the norman conquest)
[14:40:47] AutomatedTester: jimevans: for me the interesting ones are from the Civil War
[14:41:25] jimevans: that's as good a starting point as any, i suppose.

[16:07:03] totic: or How do I get all the text in the page?
[16:08:02] Turzai: regex: the problem is that your links only differ by their text. With css there is no way to select text of which i know about. You can use xpath or linketxt function. IT is weird that linkTest is now working
[16:08:38] regex: Turzai: I agree about the linktext.  I don't know why it wouldn't find it.  Maybe because it's embedded in that bound variable on the Div.
[16:08:40] Turzai: maybe you have other link tag with the text pages
[16:09:04] jezuz has joined #selenium
[16:09:14] Turzai: the other thing i can thinkk about is that it's not on the default frame
[16:09:43] regex: Turzai: Selenium by default will select the 1st clickable if two exist. 
[16:09:50] Turzai: yes
[16:10:41] regex: Turzai: I'm putting them in an array list and than clicking the indice.  That's the only way I can get it to work
[16:10:43] *simonstewart had to look up how to handle pull requests
[16:10:55] Turzai: btw i just saw that there is a an "active" in the css in that link tag with the "Pages"
[16:10:56] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: pull locally then push to GC
[16:11:04] simonstewart: Just done it
[16:11:08] Turzai: how do you now if it's not working?
[16:11:17] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: I think we should make people use --signoff
[16:11:23] AutomatedTester: so we can see who did the merge

[16:16:51] AutomatedTester: One-Man-Bucket: dont we already scroll when you try use the element?
[16:17:42] One-Man-Bucket: AutomatedTester: yes, but it doesn't scroll down far enough. only a little bit at the top of the div that the test tries to drag is on screen
[16:18:15] tobie: Possibly silly question, but are you looking at solutions to mock sensor input such as geolocation?
[16:19:05] AutomatedTester: tobie: no
[16:19:28] AutomatedTester: tobie: but that _could_ be easily done with a proxy and we have proxy support

[16:29:01] tobie: AutomatedTester: doesn't likely from https://github.com/webmetrics/browsermob-proxy
[16:29:18] lukeis: also i think there's a bug in `git mirror`  â€¦ why that branch is getting auto-deleted and created again, i have no idea
[16:29:31] AutomatedTester: tobie: from that site "POST /proxy/[port]/headers - Set and override HTTP Request headers. For example setting a custom User-Agent"
[16:30:36] AutomatedTester: tobie: it should be easy to do if you have a browsermob-proxy library
[16:31:24] lukeis: for geo-location i know of one team at my work, that sets the proxy to be that of a proxy living in one of the various international locations they want to test (luckily we have these proxies on our network in order to do soâ€¦ otherwise I think there's external services that can do it)
[16:32:02] tobie: lukeis: oh. Ok. Like that.
[16:32:09] tobie: So that works for geloc.

[16:32:38] tobie: , compass, etc.
[16:32:58] AutomatedTester: browsers have humidity sensors now?
[16:33:18] simonstewart: devices do
[16:33:25] lukeis: damn them devices ;)
[16:33:33] simonstewart: and some so-and-so will expose the information from it via a new-fangled html5 api
[16:33:44] tobie: yup.
[16:33:46] simonstewart: "getUserHumidityData"
[16:33:52] simonstewart: I think it's already in the spec somewhere
[16:33:52] AutomatedTester: ahh webapis
[16:33:56] simonstewart: fuckers
[16:34:04] simonstewart: s/fuckers/so-and-sos/g
[16:34:20] AutomatedTester: but then its a case of sending info into the browser that we need
[16:34:33] tobie: yeah, mocking the sensor.
[16:34:49] simonstewart: we can always add requiremebnts to the webdriver spec
[16:35:02] simonstewart: mocking out geo and compass directions seems reasonable
[16:35:06] simonstewart: (ditto video and camera)
[16:35:31] tobie: proximity is another common one.
[16:35:36] simonstewart: Gosh. Now I remember why I built crazyfun

[16:35:55] simonstewart: As is any kind of feedback
[16:36:00] tobie: :)
[16:36:23] tobie: I was more concerned about the implementation feasibility tbh.

[16:37:13] simonstewart: Perfect audience to ask :)

[16:41:34] tobie: Oh, awesome. Thanks.
[16:41:42] dawagner: AndroidWebDriver has a setLocation method...
[16:41:45] *AutomatedTester isnt sure what other sensors browsers support other than geolocation atm
[16:42:18] dawagner: And a location() method, where every other getter is a getFoo() method (yay!)
[16:42:34] simonstewart: Heh
[16:42:42] simonstewart: That androiddriver is a little rough
[16:42:45] simonstewart: Still, the idea is sound

[20:41:58] AutomatedTester: tobie: the tl;dr; "We rewrote Firefox for Android in October 2011 and removed all the XUL and all things hanging off that and Marionette uses a logging library associated which has caused a stir"
[20:42:20] tobie: sure.
[20:42:27] AutomatedTester: tobie: also marionette for anything not Firefox OS is on the backburner
[20:42:27] tobie: speed.
[20:42:52] tobie: AutomatedTester: fair enough.
[20:43:06] AutomatedTester: so while marionette works on Desktop, its only part of debug builds
[20:43:39] AutomatedTester: but luckily its part of our waterfall  https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Mozilla-Inbound&jobname=marionette

[20:54:00] AutomatedTester: as well as updating settings
[20:54:12] AutomatedTester: e.g. setting developer mode on
[20:54:20] tobie: right.
[20:54:35] AutomatedTester: for desktop it will be launching firefox with a special argument
[20:54:51] tobie: I'm concerned as to how this might differ dramatically from UA to UA and require lots of explaining.
[20:55:22] AutomatedTester: each UA has their own approach to security
[20:55:24] tobie: AutomatedTester: so this will require leaving the browser and re-launching it on desktop?
[20:55:45] AutomatedTester: no, the local end will launch the browser
[20:55:50] AutomatedTester: like we currently do
[20:55:54] AutomatedTester: well, at least for desktop
[20:56:20] AutomatedTester: for firefox, and it could be reused, we have a library that launches apps for us
[20:56:26] ShawnM has joined #selenium
[20:56:35] AutomatedTester: and then marionette will take over when we see Firefox is ready for a connection
[20:57:04] tobie: AutomatedTester: the scenario I'm describing has local and remote ends completely disconnected until remote end visits a url hosted by local end.
[20:57:10] AutomatedTester: currently for FirefoxOS engineering builds its always on
[20:57:24] manoj_: have a good day ahead. Signing offfâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.
[20:57:49] AutomatedTester: tobie: sorry, I was using local and remote in terms of the webdriver spec
[20:57:59] tobie: AutomatedTester: me too.
[20:58:04] tobie: :(
[20:58:18] AutomatedTester: local means client language of choice
[20:58:24] AutomatedTester: remote = browser
[20:58:30] tobie: yeah.
[20:58:38] AutomatedTester: so the local needs to speak to the browser to get started
[20:58:47] AutomatedTester: local asks the remote for a session 
[20:59:02] tobie: sure sure, but...
[20:59:35] tobie: what happens when remote is a test device in an operator's testing lab
[20:59:47] tobie: and remote is on a server hosted by W3C.
[20:59:59] tobie: arg
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Mar 18 21:00:06 2013]
[21:00:06] tobie: and local is on a server hosted by W3C.
[21:00:53] AutomatedTester: then W3C would make a request to operator phone
[21:01:00] tobie: sure.
[21:01:12] AutomatedTester: get a session and then continue
[21:01:26] tobie: But how does W3C know hot to reach remote end?
[21:01:39] tobie: s/hot/how/
[21:01:45] AutomatedTester: the operator would need to share that information
[21:01:58] Nogem has joined #selenium
[21:02:22] AutomatedTester: the could ping a server with the IP and then the local end sees the IP and sends a request for a session
[21:02:32] AutomatedTester: they could ping a server ...
[21:03:01] tobie: ok.
[21:03:28] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[21:03:32] tobie: In the marionette impl, is this info going to be surfaced to the user?
[21:03:47] AutomatedTester: tobie: at mozilla we have a thing called MozPool that manages devices
[21:03:54] chrisgao has joined #selenium
[21:04:16] AutomatedTester: I dont think marionette will surface the IP address per se
[21:04:24] AutomatedTester: since it requires a host
[21:04:58] AutomatedTester: tobie: https://blog.mozilla.org/it/2013/01/04/mozpool/
[21:08:27] AutomatedTester: tobie: marionette *could* surface IP address etc since it has access to the browser chrome
[21:08:37] AutomatedTester: tobie: but afaik ChromeDriver doesnt
[21:08:51] AutomatedTester: kkania: does ChromeDriver have access to the browser chrome?
[21:09:35] kkania: AutomatedTester: no
[21:10:02] AutomatedTester: oh kkania, had another "ZOMG I HATE Transforms"
[21:10:18] kkania: ah, yes, when are you going to fix that bug
[21:10:30] kkania: i've had a few users bugging me about it!
[21:10:33] AutomatedTester: i fixed part of it already
[21:11:02] AutomatedTester: when did you last update the atoms?
[21:11:14] kkania: when you last told me
[21:11:23] AutomatedTester: ahh, try again :)
[21:11:33] AutomatedTester: you may want to update the atoms
[21:11:40] AutomatedTester: sorry I forgot to update the bug
[21:11:52] kkania: did you pass the test case I mentioned?
[21:12:07] AutomatedTester: the chrome store screen?
[21:12:16] AutomatedTester: or the position one?
[21:12:18] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[21:13:23] AutomatedTester: kkania: also I found that the atoms(could also be Closure) dont return the right value for position on the screen
[21:13:32] AutomatedTester: but havent had time to fix
[21:13:35] AutomatedTester: sorry
[21:13:52] Revery1 has joined #selenium
[21:14:05] Turzai has joined #selenium
[21:14:30] kkania: ok, not your fault, i should probably fix some of these too; just for the transforms stuff, I'd prefer to remove that check if it has known problems and you're still working on it
[21:14:44] kkania: alright, i got to run, cya
[21:14:52] AutomatedTester: waves
[21:16:27] ryanpetrello has joined #selenium
[21:17:42] tobie: AutomatedTester: so this surfacing of the IP address to the local end by the remote one is what I was referring to as the handshake.
[21:18:04] Revery1 has joined #selenium
[21:18:12] AutomatedTester: tobie: the remote end wont know to do that without a session
[21:18:50] testingb0t has joined #selenium
[21:19:38] tobie: :( so that kind of ruins my whole use case.
[21:20:24] AutomatedTester: tobie: well you could surface that info if the remote end pings a server (REST call) and that then passes it down to the local end
[21:22:16] tobie: How would that work, concretely?
[21:22:39] AutomatedTester: tobie: mobile devices are awful things
[21:22:50] AutomatedTester: so you are going to need a mechanism to manage them
[21:23:22] AutomatedTester: that mechanism could do a REST call to w3c server, which then could collect the ip and pass it to a scheduler
[21:23:26] AutomatedTester: that would then run tests
[21:23:57] tobie: So why can't that be built in to the WD implementation in the device itself?
[21:24:18] lukeis: or connect the remote device to a grid? or is the point to have the device kick off the tests on itself?
[21:24:29] tobie: yeah. the latter.
[21:24:29] AutomatedTester: because then the device need to know that it can randomly send messages to a central server
[21:25:00] AutomatedTester: tobie: how would a mobile device know to send the message 
[21:26:19] lukeis: ios stuff has the option to specify a grid to connect toâ€¦ the W3C server could act like a grid hub and interpret that as a device available to start testing on
[21:26:53] AutomatedTester: lukeis: and thats no different to using flynn
[21:26:57] AutomatedTester: and normal grid
[21:26:57] lukeis: yep
[21:27:12] AutomatedTester: but the device still doesnt ping the server 
[21:27:17] tobie: so without web driver:
[21:27:22] AutomatedTester: we just know where it is
[21:27:34] tobie: we can just go visit a url and that starts the tests.
[21:27:37] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[21:28:11] tobie: problem is there are classes of tests we can't (for now) run that way.
[21:28:16] tobie: e.g. ref tests.
[21:28:34] tobie: (comparing the rendering of a page to a reference image)
[21:28:40] AutomatedTester: yea
[21:29:06] tobie: so the idea is: how close to this can we stay?
[21:29:31] AutomatedTester: just visiting a url?
[21:29:38] tobie: yeah
[21:30:14] AutomatedTester: remote = webdriver.Remote("ip sent to me from some random pool on the internet"); remote.get('ref test url')
[21:30:15] tobie: so the very naive thing I had in mind was:
[21:30:33] intchanter-work: :seen agoucher
[21:30:33] selbot2: I haven't seen agoucher.
[21:30:50] lukeis: :seen adamgoucher
[21:30:50] selbot2: adamgoucher was last seen about 11 hours ago, quitting.
[21:30:58] intchanter-work: lukeis: Thanks.
[21:31:52] intchanter-work: Before I leave him a note, I should ask here: Is there a newer reference I should be modeling after than http://pragprog.com/magazines/2010-08/page-objects-in-python ?
[21:32:27] intchanter-work: That used RC, but that's not too difficult to update.
[21:32:35] tobie: AutomatedTester: this code is on the local end, right?
[21:33:11] AutomatedTester: tobie: what I put there yes
[21:33:35] AutomatedTester: tobie: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/tools/reftest/runreftestb2g.py our code for marionette and ref tests on FIrefoxOS
[21:33:40] AutomatedTester: well thats the test runner
[21:37:36] Nogem has joined #selenium
[21:38:10] jimevans has left #selenium
[21:42:17] tobie: AutomatedTester: Think part of the problem my have to do with my complete lack of understanding of how IP addresses work on mobile.
[21:42:50] Revery1 has joined #selenium
[21:43:10] AutomatedTester: tobie: I think if you want something like you suggest then have a look at mozpool
[21:43:25] lukeis: on ios the device will have to be on wifiâ€¦ connecting over the air w/ a carrier won't let you connect (on our ports i think)
[21:43:40] AutomatedTester: intchanter-work: have a look at the mozilla github for *-tests
[21:43:43] tobie: lukeis: think that makes sense.
[21:43:56] AutomatedTester: those have how we do it
[21:44:08] tobie: AutomatedTester: sure, but that's kind of heavy-weight compared to: please visit the url to run the tests)
[21:44:14] AutomatedTester: intchanter-work: https://github.com/mozilla/Addon-Tests/
[21:44:51] AutomatedTester: tobie: its heavy weight but I dont think you can convince a UA that they should have a browser that randomly pings a w3c server
[21:44:59] AutomatedTester: especially Mozilla
[21:45:09] AutomatedTester: the privacy team will explode
[21:45:16] tobie: that really wasn't the point.
[21:45:58] tobie: I mean, of course that would be ridiculous. 
[21:46:00] AutomatedTester: but to have marionette, start up, without a session from and then ping a w3c to run a test
[21:46:04] intchanter-work: AutomatedTester: Thanks.
[21:46:36] AutomatedTester: intchanter-work: there are other projects on mozilla's github account that show how we do it
[21:47:33] AutomatedTester: tobie: the other thing, which you will learn quickly, is mobile devices are unreliable
[21:47:41] AutomatedTester: very unreliable
[21:47:51] lukeis: (and slow)
[21:48:02] tobie: sure.
[21:48:04] davehunt has joined #selenium
[21:48:09] AutomatedTester: tobie: if you want i can introduce you our "mobile" guy
[21:48:10] tobie: but this isn't for CI
[21:48:53] tobie: for CI, people will just download the testsuite and run their own thing.
[21:49:09] tobie: This is for one shot tests.
[21:49:44] tobie: use cases are: devs bumping into an issue on a device and wanting to run a particular subset of tests.
[21:50:08] AutomatedTester: then couldnt they navigate themselves?
[21:50:20] tobie: operator wanting to run the whole batch of tests and the submit the results to a certification authority.
[21:50:35] tobie: AutomatedTester: depends what you mean by navigate.
[21:50:47] AutomatedTester: open browser, type url manually
[21:51:09] AutomatedTester: for the operator use case I dont see much difference between an operator and a UA
[21:51:14] tobie: sure. but we'd like to automate the ref testing.
[21:51:28] tobie: which implies access to taking screenshots.
[21:51:32] qaguy has joined #selenium
[21:51:55] AutomatedTester: you _could_ take a screenshot in the sandbox
[21:52:20] tobie: same, later on, for a11y (where we'd like to see if WD could provide access to thea11y tree)
[21:52:23] AutomatedTester: push everything to a canvas, ask for base64 image back
[21:53:10] AutomatedTester: tobie: ok for argument sake the device pinged the w3c server
[21:53:17] AutomatedTester: how would you do browser launch?
[21:54:10] tobie: Well, I have no idea.
[21:54:13] tobie: :)
[21:54:35] AutomatedTester: the session create from the local end ensures browser launch
[21:54:59] AutomatedTester: right I should go to bed
[21:55:11] tobie: yeah, me too.
[21:55:15] tobie: Where are you based?
[21:55:20] AutomatedTester: in the UK
[21:55:23] tobie: ok
