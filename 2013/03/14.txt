[12:09:23] jimevans: at least, that's the wire-protocol format. once it's decoded on the language bindings side, you should be able to convert it to whatever you need.

[14:34:05] RossPatterson: That XPath looks correct.  I see you're trying to click on a particular pixel in the <SPAN> - that's something I've never tried, but it ought to work.  Whether it will provoke the expected Dojo reaction is a separate question - SPANs aren't BUTTONs or links, despite what JavaScript framework authors like to think.
[14:37:32] Basti890: :( so any possibilities I can try? or do to provocate a user mouse click instead of a selenium mouse click?

[14:48:10] davehunt has joined #selenium
[14:48:20] Basti890: I can edit the Entry, but its not selected like, when I click with mouse, no selection = not deletable)
[14:54:07] RossPatterson: The real question is "what does Dojo expect you to click on?"  Sorry I can't help you
[14:56:56] Basti890: OK its realy wired, it seems that Selenium-click does not effect thesame like user mouse click,.... :O Do you know where i can find information about HOW SELENIUM REALIZES A CLICK (mouse down â†’ mouse up how its simulatet)

[15:04:03] Basti890: OK thank you very much for trying to help me, maybe we'll have to test this part of the application manually in future :(
[15:04:07] RossPatterson: Not for the Selenium RC API that you're using.  The Selenium Project has largely moved on to the WebDriver API.
[15:04:16] Basti890: bb guys have a nice day :)
[15:04:21] RossPatterson: For that API, it's kind-of well-defined.

[17:48:00] brokenthumbs:        Error: cannot open display: 98
[17:48:01] dimacus: are you talking about jenkins slave or webdriver slave?
[17:48:05] brokenthumbs: oop, sorry bad format
[17:48:14] brokenthumbs: webdriver slave is in use
[17:48:22] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[17:48:22] brokenthumbs: that's the status from the "selenium grid" status page in jenkins
[17:48:33] dimacus: so i'm getting the same thing alsoâ€¦ when i kill a build in IE mid-run
[17:48:43] dimacus: thata is abort the build
[17:49:01] dimacus: only after i restarted the jenkins, and the webdriver slave
[17:49:06] dimacus: the status went back to idel
[17:49:15] dimacus: so it seems that the jenkins grid plugin is buggy
[17:49:42] dimacus: brokenthumbs:  but that might be a seperate issue
[17:49:49] JoonLee has joined #selenium
[17:49:59] brokenthumbs: the slaves go back to idle
[17:50:10] dimacus: the webdriver slave you got, is it running on a linux box?
[17:50:11] brokenthumbs: so, i don't believe that's the issue
[17:50:17] brokenthumbs: linux box slave, yes
[17:50:20] brokenthumbs: linux master, linux slave
[17:50:30] dimacus: ok, and how do you start the slave jar?
[17:50:36] dimacus: ssh into the box and start it that way/
[17:50:44] dimacus: or do you vnc into the box and start it that way?
[17:50:53] brokenthumbs: no, the slave jar gets started, i believe, through the selenium grid plugin
[17:51:21] brokenthumbs: i see the slaves listed under registered remote controls when viewing the selenium configuration page for the selenium plugin in jenkins
[17:51:21] dimacus: let me open that up real quick
[17:51:24] brokenthumbs: sure

[17:52:19] davehunt has joined #selenium
[17:54:00] alext has joined #selenium
[17:54:02] dimacus: brokenthumbs:  so in the latest version of the plugin (i installed yesterday) i can't find the feature which sets up the webdriver slave for you, can you point me to that location
[17:54:37] brokenthumbs: http://jenkins.com/selenium/configurations
[17:54:57] brokenthumbs: from there, we add a new configuration
[17:55:00] dimacus: ahh much obliged
[17:55:08] brokenthumbs: type being custom web driver node configuration
[17:55:19] brokenthumbs: and then we browse to the slaves that it matches, and start up the servers using a button
[17:55:21] dimacus: so i belive the issue is this
[17:55:53] davehunt has joined #selenium
[17:56:22] brokenthumbs: ?
[17:56:26] dimacus: linux usually does not allow you to start gui apps if you are ssh'd into the boxâ€¦ 
[17:56:28] sdaniel has joined #selenium
[17:57:23] brokenthumbs: ....eh?
[17:57:23] riv_ has joined #selenium
[17:57:39] brokenthumbs: do you mean if i have an active ssh session?
[17:57:52] dimacus: well for example
[17:58:26] dimacus: when you have jenkins slave running on the box, it is running as a user, so you can tell it to start XVFB and tell it to open firefox in that dispaly
[17:58:45] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[17:58:51] brokenthumbs: what if xvfb is already running on the server?
[17:58:59] dimacus: that might help
[17:59:06] brokenthumbs: i seem to run into the same issue though
[17:59:16] brokenthumbs: with the "error: cannot open display: 99"
[17:59:24] brokenthumbs: or, Unable to connect to host localhost on port 7055 after 45000 ms.
[17:59:37] dimacus: hahah yeahâ€¦ bc you start on display 98 and it says that 98 is busy so it tries 99
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Mar 14 18:01:02 2013]
[18:01:02] brokenthumbs: so, i define the display i want in the selenium configuration, the gui where it says "add new configuration"
[18:01:22] brokenthumbs: 	DISPLAY=99
[18:01:23] brokenthumbs: 		-port
[18:01:23] brokenthumbs: 4444
[18:01:23] brokenthumbs: -browser
[18:01:23] brokenthumbs: seleniumProtocol=WebDriver,browserName=firefox,maxInstances=4
[18:01:35] brokenthumbs: one of the running configurations i have
[18:01:50] brokenthumbs: however, when it tries to run, it says "cannot open display 99" for that particular configuration
[18:03:56] alext: also a vagrant-rackspace was launched
[18:04:01] alext: oops wrong window
[18:06:58] dimacus: brokenthumbs:  sorry i'm a little stumped right nowâ€¦ i had a similar issue 4 years ago, but for the life of me i can't remeber how to solve it
[18:07:11] dimacus: it was some stupid obscure permission issue...
[18:07:11] brokenthumbs: dimacus: it's alright, i appreciate the effort :)
[18:07:23] brokenthumbs: obscure permission issue is a good hint
[18:07:24] dimacus: how about this, when you start the test
[18:07:37] dimacus: does xvfb launch on scrren 98?
[18:07:40] dimacus: or 99?
[18:07:46] dimacus: on the slave itself?
[18:08:56] dimacus: could your issue be that the test is not able to start xvfb and that is why selenium cannot open in a window
[18:09:32] brokenthumbs: yeah, that's the idea
[18:09:40] brokenthumbs: but, we've tried running xvfb on that slave
[18:09:45] brokenthumbs: and it still couldn't connect
[18:09:51] davehunt has joined #selenium
[18:10:13] dimacus: it feels like there is a conflict in opening an instance of xvfb
[18:10:30] brokenthumbs: that's what i thought too
[18:10:30] dimacus: in the config, what are you setting X11 display option to?
[18:10:39] brokenthumbs: display=99
[18:10:48] brokenthumbs: i've tried it with the slave not running xvfb
[18:10:54] brokenthumbs: and i've tried it with the slave running xvfb
[18:10:57] brokenthumbs: same error each time
[18:12:18] dimacus: so here is an idea, i'm 99% certain it will work :)
[18:12:33] dimacus: if you start XVFB on the boxâ€¦ say display 1â€¦ then VNC into that box
[18:12:47] dimacus: and start the webdriver slave from the VNC window via the gui
[18:12:50] brokenthumbs: can i vnc into the box if only xvfb is running?
[18:13:02] brokenthumbs: or do i need to run something else as well?
[18:13:10] dimacus: yeah
[18:13:17] dimacus: well you might need to start VNC server
[18:13:23] dimacus: unless you have phisicall issue to the box
[18:13:30] dimacus: ie keyboard and monitor
[18:14:22] brokenthumbs: so, the idea would be to have xvfb running, as well as a vnc server, such as..... x11vnc?
[18:14:33] brokenthumbs: and then vnc into the box and start the webdriver slave manually via the gui?
[18:14:44] brokenthumbs: at least with that, i can get some feedback about what could be erroring
[18:14:44] dimacus: yes
[18:14:57] dimacus: because if that works, which i belive it will
[18:15:11] dimacus: you have all permissions as the user to start firefox in display "1"
[18:15:36] brokenthumbs: display 1, is that an arbitrary number?
[18:18:08] dimacus: yes
[18:18:42] dimacus: display 0 is used by they monitor you connect directly to computer, that's the default oneâ€¦ any other number above that is arbitrary
[18:23:44] brokenthumbs: gotcha
[18:23:56] brokenthumbs: in the process of getting x11vnc installed and trying to vnc into the slave machine

[19:02:33] brokenthumbs: dimacus: is that the right command i'm using?
[19:02:38] brokenthumbs: or should i try a different command?
[19:02:41] dimacus: no that's not the command
[19:02:46] brokenthumbs: ok
[19:02:57] brokenthumbs: this is the command that the master is starting selenium on the slaves with
[19:02:59] brokenthumbs: which command should i try?
[19:03:00] dimacus: we will not use jenkins stuff now but direclty connect
[19:03:06] dimacus: so do this
[19:03:06] brokenthumbs: ok
[19:03:11] jleyba: is the protocol used for grid documented anywhere?
[19:03:40] dimacus: java -jar pathto/selenium-serverâ€¦jar -role node -hub http://jenkins:4444/grid/register
[19:04:10] dimacus: brokenthumbs:  you have to config that commanad a little ^^
[19:05:05] dimacus: jleyba:  yeah i've been wondering that myselfâ€¦ so i'd love to know that also
[19:05:19] brokenthumbs: i've had a tough time learning how to use grid
[19:05:27] lukeis: jleyba: not reallyâ€¦ -help and then 'trying' to read the source is the best i've done
[19:05:27] brokenthumbs: ok
[19:05:51] intchanter-work: jleyba: I thought it would just be the Selenium wire protocol, which I thought is JSON-based.
[19:05:55] brokenthumbs: so, my java -jar command is running
[19:06:12] brokenthumbs: if i go to http://jenkins:4444/status, where should i see this?
[19:06:21] brokenthumbs: to see which nodes are connected to my hub?
[19:06:33] lukeis: :4444/grid/console
[19:07:00] brokenthumbs: gotcha
[19:07:04] lukeis:  /grid/beta/console  (for a better look and feel)
[19:07:09] jleyba: intchanter-work: I know the Selenium wire protocol. Looking for the load balancing bits
[19:07:20] dimacus: brokenthumbs:  it should look something like that http://i.imgur.com/wxhStJt.jpg
[19:07:23] intchanter-work: Ah.
[19:07:24] jleyba: lukeis: Ok.. I'm not interested enough to go reading through the source :)
[19:07:46] lukeis: jleyba: it's not a load balancer reallyâ€¦ it picks free nodes and sends it there
[19:07:51] lukeis: sometimes all from one node
[19:07:51] dimacus: lukeis:  i'm interested to look through source but i'm terrible at java
[19:07:54] brokenthumbs: dimacus: perfect, that's what we have
[19:07:58] brokenthumbs: okay, now we'll try to run and see what happens
[19:08:07] dimacus: brokenthumbs: good luck
[19:08:55] brokenthumbs: dimacus: IT WORKED but only after we started it by hand
[19:08:57] dimacus: lukeis: i'd love to implement a simple REST api in the grid thoughâ€¦ just not sure who to talk to, in order to get started
[19:09:23] jleyba: changing topics... it amazes me that i can get a test to be rock solid in ie7/8, but ie9/10 want to be fickle little bitches and flake 10-15% of the time
[19:09:29] brokenthumbs: dimacus: now to debug why i can't run tests if jenkins starts the slave
[19:09:38] dimacus: brokenthumbs:  soâ€¦ there is a bug somewhere in the plugin...
[19:09:38] brokenthumbs: dimacus: so, it definitely works if i start the slave by hand
[19:10:06] brokenthumbs: nice
[19:10:07] dimacus: brokenthumbs:  if you get tiredâ€¦ do what i did, i just made the webdriver slave a service on the linux box
[19:10:17] brokenthumbs: dimacus: and just start automatically on reboot?
[19:10:20] lukeis: dimacus: francois has a couple of github projects to look at to get startedâ€¦ but you'll really have to know java.  (freynaud on github)
[19:10:22] dimacus: because that plugin is so buggy it's driving me insane
[19:11:08] brokenthumbs: dimacus: you're right
[19:11:10] dimacus: brokenthumbs: my big issue is, if you kill a job in mid-run of IE, you have to reboot jenkins before the plugin grid actually notices that windows box is no longer availableâ€¦ so it keeps sending new builds to non-existing windows box
[19:11:10] lukeis: dimacus: https://github.com/freynaud/grid-plugin-tutorial
[19:11:50] dimacus: lukeis:  thank you good sirâ€¦ i just picked up some java booksâ€¦ time to expend my horizons out of ruby into more evil java ;)
[19:12:22] brokenthumbs: dimacus: does that apply to linux?
[19:12:28] brokenthumbs: dimacus: thanks for helping me debug, btw, super super huge help
[19:12:37] brokenthumbs: dimacus: nightmare trying to figure out why it wasn't working
[19:12:54] dimacus: brokenthumbs:  no clue.. i'm running tests on linux directly without the gridâ€¦ just IE is my broblem
[19:13:26] brokenthumbs: dimacus: we'll deal with that problem when the time comes (hopefully i don't run into any more issues)
[19:13:50] brokenthumbs: dimacus: so, the solution for us right now, i believe, is to get the hub started on reboot of the master in jenkins, and the nodes started on reboot of the slaves
[19:14:37] dimacus: brokenthumbs:  pretty much what i'm doing
[19:15:27] dimacus: brokenthumbs:  also, this gives you a little more linenceâ€¦ because the jenkins plugin is not updated as often as webdriverâ€¦ so if you don't want a bug fix to be added in 6 monthsâ€¦ just use the grid directly
[19:16:28] dimacus: lukeis:  thank you good sir, i'll start hacking awayâ€¦ it seems that everyone is looking for a REST apiâ€¦ and i really need it also, if it works maybe i can push it out to OSS
[19:17:08] brokenthumbs: dimacus: thanks, awesome advice
[19:18:10] dimacus: brokenthumbs:  np
[19:18:18] lukeis: dimacus: "push it out to OSS" <- that would be ideal ;)

[19:58:24] nirvdrum: Cool.
[19:58:26] jimevans: i don't want to commit it yet to master, because it's a really intrusive change.
[19:58:56] nirvdrum: What'd you replace CImage with?
[19:58:58] jimevans: but i wanted to know if you could vet my screenshot changes. i could drop you a built .exe, or whatever you wanted to tyr.
[19:58:59] jimevans: try.
[19:59:10] nirvdrum: IIRC, it handle bit depth conversion and things like that.
[19:59:23] lukeis: cool, formal announcement on chromedriver2 :)
[19:59:41] nirvdrum: jimevans: Sure.  Although it'd be a lot easier for me to try it over the weekend.
[19:59:55] jimevans: nirvdrum: i'm sure it does, and i'm sure my implementation is really dumb.

[20:00:10] nirvdrum: I could route some mogotest traffic to servers running the new exe as a spot test.
[20:00:50] jimevans: i've just gone with straight windows API calls, loading and calling GDI+ api calls to get conversion to PNG.
[20:02:20] nirvdrum: I thought there was some reason I skipped GDI+.  But it was 3.5 years ago, so unlikely I'll recall.
[20:02:42] nirvdrum: It may have to do with a desire to statically link.

[20:04:09] nirvdrum: But I run with a fixed color depth (24 bits, IIRC) and via the UltraVNC mirror driver.
[20:04:26] nirvdrum: Testing 16 or 32 bit is going to be a lot harder for me to do.
[20:05:23] nirvdrum: I can do some via VMs though.

[20:42:10] itatitat: guys, i've some tests in selenium in a server, they must run  with jenkins
[20:42:35] itatitat: the problem is that they fire firefox only when I make ssh -X ...., if not, firefox is not fired...
[20:43:33] lukeis: firefox requires a display to be run on
[20:44:01] Selenium: intchanter: do you have an instance of X running on the box?
[20:44:14] Selenium: or install a VNC server which will set one up for you
[20:44:26] Selenium: here is what i do
[20:44:35] Selenium: vncserver :1 (display size args)
[20:44:44] Selenium: export DISPLAY=:!
[20:44:47] Selenium: :1
[20:44:55] Selenium: blah blah selenium.tests
[20:45:54] Selenium: intchanter: try it with thatâ€¦as in pre-build in your jenkins command
[20:46:29] Selenium: since jenkins.jar runs as a local user it should aquire the rest of the X permissions as if you are not SSHing but running locally
[20:48:19] itatitat: lukeis: but I installed x window, and firefox in the server
[20:48:31] itatitat: is not enough?, should run as usual in the server no?
[20:50:10] Selenium: itatitat: it is enoughâ€¦ but if you don't start it yourself, jenkins wont do it for you unless you install this pluging https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Xvnc+Plugin
[20:51:04] itatitat: I was starting selenium by using "screen" (it wasnt working), 
[20:51:30] Selenium: the linux screen command in the console?
[20:52:06] itatitat: yes
[20:52:20] itatitat: with that I ran selenium, and later I closed the session
[20:53:13] Selenium: i don't think you need to run screen for that, you can run it directly in ciâ€¦ screen allows you to save a console CLI session and share it over time, even after you are no longer ssh'd into the box
[20:53:40] lukeis: did you specify the X session to use when you ran it?   (as Selenium said above ^)  export DISPLAY=:1  ?
[20:54:09] itatitat: I dont remember...many experiments, I dont remember sorry
[20:54:12] Selenium: +1 on ^^ you need to explicitly export display
[20:54:31] itatitat: the export display is to run it in the server no?
[20:54:33] lukeis: itatitat: you can always see what you did in the screen session ;)
[20:54:40] lukeis: yes
[20:55:22] itatitat: I made echo $DISPLAY, but nothing, I didnt see anything
[20:55:30] Selenium: intchanter: when you export display, you tell linux which display to launch firefox window inâ€¦ if you don't specify it it is blank
[20:55:39] Selenium: so firefox wont know where to launch
[20:55:46] itatitat: aaaaaaaaaaaaaah
[20:55:48] itatitat: wow thanks

[20:57:20] Selenium: nifty shortcutsâ€¦ i need to learn them all
[20:57:35] matt___ has joined #selenium
[20:58:10] Selenium: itatitat: lukeis: one big advantage of running headless is that it's fasterâ€¦ disadvantage is that you cannot watch an executionâ€¦ sometimes it's the most useful way to debug when tests randomly fail for unexplained reason and an unkonwn error
[20:58:27] lukeis: use xvnc and you can watch it
[20:58:37] lukeis: even record it ;)

[21:21:09] itatitat: guys I installed the plugin xvnc-server in jenkins, but now all my tests are skipped.............
[21:21:34] itatitat: the rest of tests were very easy, but this in jenkins is being overhelmed.....
[21:21:49] dimacus: itatitat: well did you configure it all the way around?
[21:22:00] dimacus: part of the reason i don't use that plugin is too many configurations
[21:22:26] itatitat: xvnc server, running in localhost, port 4444, OS: linux, I made export DISPLAY:1, I closed all ssh sessions, and I clicked in build...
[21:22:27] dimacus: so before my tests start, i just start up vnc and export display in the "Execute Shell" portion
[21:24:07] itatitat: now im trying only with "run an instance of selencium rc"

[21:58:44] totic1: How do I reset the zoom of a page using selenium?
[21:59:00] lukeis: reset?
[21:59:12] lukeis: how did it get changed to begin with?
[21:59:27] totic1: lukeis: equivalen to pressing Ctrl + 0 or CMD + 0
[21:59:35] lukeis: what browser?
[21:59:39] totic1: chrome
[21:59:58] lukeis: how did it get zoomed?
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Mar 14 22:00:01 2013]
[22:00:01] totic1: or any for that matter
[22:00:26] totic1: I want to see how to change the zoom, to make sure our page looks good under different zooms
[22:00:52] lukeis: you might have success with the Action chains
[22:00:58] lukeis: *might*
[22:01:04] lukeis: and native events is a must
[22:01:14] lukeis: so no FF on mac
[22:01:47] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[22:01:55] dimacus: totic1: i'm very curious how you got it zooomed in the first place alsoâ€¦ sounds like a cool "feature"
[22:01:56] totic1: what do you mean by no FF on mac?
[22:01:59] lukeis: either that or send_keys to the body element (probably the same effect)
[22:02:10] lukeis: Firefox on Mac does not support native events
[22:02:12] totic1: I had it zoomed in my personal machine
[22:02:20] dimacus: ah
[22:02:30] dimacus: so now when the test begins it starts in zoomed mode?
[22:02:36] totic1: yup
[22:02:50] lukeis: firefox and chrome use a new profileâ€¦ unless that was some kind of system setting?
[22:02:52] dimacus: well do Ctrl (Command on mac) + )
[22:02:53] dimacus: )
[22:02:55] dimacus: 0
[22:02:57] dimacus: damn it!
[22:03:08] dimacus: Ctrl + 0
[22:03:21] dimacus: unzoom it on your local and let tests be unzoomed also?
[22:03:26] totic1: CMD+0 will fix it
[22:03:42] dimacus: or do you want it to be zoomed for you but zoomed out for test?
[22:03:48] totic1: I figured I might as well test it different zooms
[22:04:10] totic1: to get the body element I should use? driver.find_element_by_name("body") ?
[22:04:24] lukeis: by_tag_name
[22:04:25] totic1: class_name actually right?
[22:06:09] totic1: this seems to have done it :) driver.find_elements_by_tag_name('body')[0].send_keys(Keys.CONTROL, '0')
[22:07:40] lukeis: only thing i'd recommend is to do it as a find_element_by.. rather than elements 
[22:08:32] lukeis: nicer exception to bubble up is 'element not found' vs. 'index out of bounds'
[22:10:04] totic1: man selenium is great, but damn those browsers make writing tests awful
[22:10:59] dimacus: totic1: yeahâ€¦ i'm still confused why your selenium didn't get a new profile for chrome before the test runâ€¦ reset it to the most basic browser state
[22:11:31] totic1: I am testing ie[6,7,8,9,10], opera12, firefox[12,13,14,15] chrome[23,24,25] and ie 8 sometimes crashes in the middle of tests
[22:11:40] totic1: its like they are not determinisit

[22:16:07] DarkRift: is there a reason why clicking on a disabled button doesn't throw some kind of exception in selenium ? I'm trying to think of why we would want to click on something disabled that would make sense
[22:17:18] DarkRift: or was that implemented after 2.29 ?
[22:17:29] lukeis: DarkRift: can a user click on it and have it do nothing? :)
[22:18:15] DarkRift: yeah but then what if the user expect it to do something but was disabled ... 
[22:18:25] lukeis: then that's a UI bug
[22:18:35] lukeis: with the app
[22:18:36] DarkRift: sure I can add this check to my my framework to throw something
[22:18:54] DarkRift: but I was wondering why selenium didn't do it
[22:18:56] lukeis: i think you should then
[22:18:56] DarkRift: at first
[22:19:03] DarkRift: I will for sure
[22:19:48] DarkRift: interacting with a disabled button seems to me like a disabled field you would want to fill with some input ...
[22:19:49] lukeis: i recall a discussion about it a while agoâ€¦ but basically comes down to can an end user click on it? the answer is yesâ€¦ but it does nothingâ€¦ same as clicking on whitespace in the body
[22:19:51] DarkRift: makes no sense
[22:20:02] DarkRift: ok
[22:20:06] lukeis: element.isEnabled() exists :)

[22:22:40] DarkRift: some guy that didn't want the whole app to crash
[22:23:11] lukeis: yeah, but leaves me completely in the dark as to why it failedâ€¦ oh and it doesn't recover gracefully with my exception ;)
[22:24:20] dimacus: lukeis: what do you mean, a blank catch for an exception is a bad idea? i've never heard such a thing ;)
[22:24:46] Revery: that's so trueâ€¦he should have at least put log("here be dragons")

[22:31:02] Hammertime38: well, i have a proposal :)
[22:31:13] adamgoucher: well, our first two attempts at it were less than positive in terms of lasting impact. i'm not even sure that se is the time of project that can use gsoc effectively since we're trying to push things onto the vendors
[22:32:02] lukeis: trueâ€¦ although we have mounds of documentation that could be written ;)
[22:32:42] Hammertime38: this one regards ios-driver, which i believe will have quite an impact
[22:33:41] adamgoucher: now, is this the existing ios-driver, freynaud's (sp?) driver, the objective c driver, ios-for-appium, etc?
[22:33:56] Hammertime38: freynaud's ios-driver
[22:34:45] Hammertime38: we've interpreted it to .NET using a basic conversion library (messy), but the implementation is fully functional...we want to spend the summer creating the bindings for C#
[22:35:39] lukeis: Hammertime38: no need to create new bindings in C#, the existings one will work
