[22:28:34] is_null: hi all, is it possible to make python selenium more synchronous ? i have to increase my sleeps again to get pass on travis-ci ... on code like this:         self.input_element().send_keys('par')
[22:28:38] is_null:         time.sleep(10)
[22:32:56] is_null: humn wait.until might do just the trick
[22:42:06] samphippen has joined #selenium
[22:58:21] intchanter: is_null: That's the typical solution, to wait until some condition changes.
[22:58:40] intchanter: With an optional maximum amount of time to wait.

[23:20:49] is_null: thanks intchanter ... also, after clicking a form submit button, should wait_for_page_to_load be used to wait for the server response to load ?
[23:26:41] intchanter: Are you using the old RC bindings?
[23:26:56] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[23:27:20] intchanter: I think the new webdriver bindings don't have that, as it's considered an unsolved problem, and the old one didn't really work as advertised.
[23:27:58] intchanter: So it's better to code your own wait that checks for some condition that means that this particular page has finished loading sufficiently for your purposes.
[23:28:33] intchanter: To give you an idea of some of the possible problems:
[23:28:40] intchanter: 1. Is it enough to ha
[23:28:54] intchanter: have the HTML loaded?  The images?  Javascript?
[23:29:10] intchanter: 2. If there's Javascript, do you wait for it to finish running?
[23:29:21] intchanter: 3. How do you know enough Javascript has run?
[23:29:35] phishy has joined #selenium
[23:30:44] intchanter: So with the old bindings, people would use it assuming that the page would be ready for whatever they needed, which was reasonable based on the name of the function.
[23:30:54] intchanter: But not realistic, and that assumption would bite them.
