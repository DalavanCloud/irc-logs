[00:00:25] BW^-: dude-x_: let's see, from about:config i found two filenames with logs, so the webdriver is confirming it's installed and outputing something. but nothing about any listening portl
[00:01:08] Dude-X_: web driver is the key in about...
[00:01:18] Dude-X_: but it does set the listening port to 7055
[00:01:38] Dude-X_: or maybe the extension itself is set to that
[00:01:38] BW^-: dude-x_: does it really start listening presuming only that the plugin is installed?
[00:01:47] Dude-X_: yes it needs the plugin
[00:02:23] Dude-X_: the plugin pretty much has the interpreter and "web server"
[00:02:56] Dude-X_: also it needs the profile set with certain things disabled so that web driver can do things cleanly
[00:03:06] BW^-: dude-x_: so i've installed the plugin. tried to look in the Py souces but didn't see any additional clue except for that "webdriver_firefox_port" setting declared there, that i don't know how i could introduce to firefox yet
[00:03:17] BW^-: dude-x_: should it just work? any suggestion for how i make it work?
[00:03:37] Dude-X_: there's the anonymous profile that sets a whole bunch of user.prefs settings
[00:03:44] Dude-X_: it's under FIrefoxprofile
[00:04:59] BW^-: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/firefox_profile.py
[00:06:46] Dude-X_: after reading the source code, i am lead to believe the XPS file hardcodes the default port
[00:07:06] Dude-X_: the Java code makes it seem you can change the port too but i am not convinced that works
[00:07:10] Dude-X_: last time l looked
[00:07:42] BW^-: hm
[00:10:14] BW^-: dude-x_: still trying to figure out. where in the .xps would the port number be harcdoded?
[00:10:25] Dude-X_: i never saw the source code for that
[00:10:26] BW^-: netstat indeed shows my computer is listening on some ports, but i can't see any seeming relevant
[00:10:28] BW^-: k
[00:10:44] Dude-X_: the main # is 7055 on firefox
[00:11:26] Dude-X_: the driver will use any available port to listen back from the extension
[00:12:01] BW^-: dude-x_: now checked with "netstat -b" on windows, and the firefox is not listening on any port
[00:12:58] Dude-X_: does firefox say "Webdriver" at the bottom?
[00:13:58] BW^-: dude-x_: no
[00:14:10] BW^-: dude-x_: i mean, i have no statusbar or anything at the bottom of the firefox, and don't know how to enable
[00:14:11] Dude-X_: then the extension is not loaded
[00:14:12] Dude-X_: or primed
[00:14:19] BW^-: ah wait wait
[00:14:31] BW^-: dude-x_: i clicked "AddOn Bar" andn ow it shows "Webdriver"  at the bottom right indeed! =)
[00:14:51] Dude-X_: why are you trying to do raw web driver?
[00:14:56] BW^-: dude-x_: and when i move the mouse over webdriver, it says "this firefox can be remote controlled with webdriver".
[00:15:09] BW^-: dude-x_: well i think it should work first of all
[00:15:18] BW^-: and second, because i want to do manual json requests to the firefox
[00:15:20] Dude-X_: it doesn't work on freeBSD?
[00:15:27] BW^-: didn't try, i don't have that installed
[00:15:30] BW^-: now am trying on MS Windows
[00:15:35] BW^-: just to get an idea
[00:15:37] Dude-X_: oh
[00:15:40] BW^-: should be really straightforward, i mean it's just a plugin
[00:15:46] Dude-X_: not just a plugin
[00:15:54] BW^-: well, almost just a plugin :)
[00:15:59] Dude-X_: you need to have the right settings in the profile
[00:16:03] Dude-X_: then it loads the plugin
[00:16:04] BW^-: supposedly i don't need the native stuff, so for my usecase it should reduce to that
[00:16:24] BW^-: apparently my firefox loads the plugin already
[00:16:58] BW^-: hmm. soo. i do have a default dir for firefox.
[00:17:33] Dude-X_: the PHP bindings do raw JSON wire for communicating with browsers. not fun
[00:18:24] BW^-: dude-x_: maybe i should check how it starts firefox
[00:18:31] BW^-: i got now how the Py file modifies the profile file anyhow
[00:18:47] BW^-: it's really basic, it just adds user_pref(key,value); copmmands to prefs.js
[00:19:11] Dude-X_: yeah
[00:20:20] BW^-: tried manually adding webdriver_firefox_port, 7055 in my global firefox conf, did not have effect. now. hmm.
[00:20:28] BW^-: ah wait, i added it as string *changing to integer*
[00:20:46] Dude-X_: in java or python when you call driver = FirefoxDriver() it will first create an anonymous profile (prefs.js) and then load the extension in firefox. visibility you'll see firefox open then close again; then it will open again, ready to listen to json commands
[00:22:38] BW^-: dude-x_: what's your point now,t hat it runs and closes and then runs again by some reason?
[00:23:46] Dude-X_: yes
[00:23:53] Dude-X_: i think it calls firefox with the profile command
[00:24:01] BW^-: right
[00:24:09] BW^-: dude-x_: but, if i add this to my global profile, it should work fine too
[00:24:55] Dude-X_: to load that profile and load the extension. it shuts down firefox so that it can load the extension (since most extensions need to restart firefox anyway) 
[00:28:46] Dude-X_: getting dinnner

[00:29:05] BW^-: dude-x_: .. ah this is difficult, i can't see how to get this going
[00:29:17] BW^-: should be simple though
[00:29:41] Dude-X_: try debugging the python
[00:29:46] Dude-X_: bindings
[00:29:57] Dude-X_: you will see step by step what happens

[02:01:29] stephend: BW^-: having problems with Grid/launching Firefox?
[02:04:37] BW^-: yey :)
[02:04:46] BW^-: stephend: it took about 4hrs to get it going though now i did it
[02:04:57] BW^-: manual json access over telnet finally going, yey :)
[02:05:01] stephend|out: oh cool
[02:05:18] BW^-: now
[02:05:18] stephend|out: BW^-: you're Python, is that right?
[02:05:18] BW^-: stephend|out: i'm telnet!
[02:05:22] stephend|out: heh, well
[02:05:31] BW^-: i was surprised to see that i ran into an error when starting the XPI
[02:05:37] stephend|out: I say a "Py file" reference
[02:05:38] stephend|out: ah
[02:05:47] BW^-: it required a profile property that firefox had not set
[02:05:49] BW^-: so it threw exception
[02:05:50] BW^-: !!!
[02:06:05] BW^-: namely this one network.http.max-connections-per-server
[02:06:14] BW^-: it was not set in my firefox, whichi s the ordinary one from getfirefox.com
[02:06:15] stephend|out: what's your command-line arg?
[02:06:24] BW^-: and, the py or java files don't set that one too
[02:06:27] BW^-: stephend|out: none.
[02:06:31] BW^-: to firefox, if that's what you mean.
[02:06:32] stephend|out: hrm
[02:06:43] BW^-: the absence of network.http.max-connections-per-server made httpd.js throw exception
[02:06:51] BW^-: anyhow, luckily i found out so it's fine
[02:06:56] stephend|out: ah, yeah
[02:07:06] stephend|out: we push prefs via JSON too, in our plugin
[02:07:11] BW^-: btw, it appears to me that the server address used by the XPI is localhost:[port number]
[02:07:17] BW^-: but i didn't see where it actually says localhost in the code
[02:07:19] BW^-: how is it?
[02:07:19] stephend|out: BW^-: we're Python -- py.test and a custom Grid/Saucelabs config
[02:07:30] BW^-: for security, it would make sense to only listen to localhost, not accept from other hosts
[02:07:34] BW^-: at least as default setting
[02:07:42] BW^-: stephend|out: ok
[02:07:45] stephend|out: sorry, heh
[02:07:54] stephend|out: even though I work for Mozilla, I don't actually know
[02:07:58] stephend|out: don't know much about client stuff
[02:08:02] BW^-: hehe
[02:08:19] BW^-: stephend|out: in httpd.conf, the web server constructor has as second argument "loopback" which if true means it listens to localhost only
[02:08:30] BW^-: though duno where the httpd is instantiated :)
[02:08:41] BW^-: also i should be able to read this from netstat but .. em :)
[02:09:15] BW^-: hmm. yes, looking at the netstat output, i cannot understand it as that it'd be listening on anything else than localhost
[02:09:28] BW^-: also, trying to connect from another machine appears to fail.
[02:10:09] stephend|out: ah, you're all integrated
[02:10:11] BW^-: yeah so it must be localhost only - great
[02:10:24] BW^-: very well
[02:10:25] BW^-: well
[02:10:31] BW^-: got it going now, very neat. :)
[02:11:09] BW^-: stephend|out: how come  you queried about python and the grid, were you thinking about any particular code issue relating to those or?
[02:11:25] stephend|out: BW^-: always interested in Grid-stability issues
[02:11:39] stephend|out: https://github.com/mozilla/moz-grid-config
[02:12:18] stephend|out: there's our config -- we've reported quite a few issues, but there are still problems w/Firefox on our gird
[02:12:19] stephend|out: grid
[02:13:11] BW^-: aha
[02:13:16] BW^-: what's the mechanism of this grid thing?
[02:13:27] BW^-: i mean, it's not just separate instances running separately on separate machines?
[02:13:37] BW^-: running a set of sessions each?
[02:13:51] stephend|out: we have 7 nodes running on mac mini
[02:13:56] stephend|out: and VMs within those nodes
[02:14:03] stephend|out: let me show you our architecture
[02:14:35] stephend|out: https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Execution/Web_Testing/Automation/Selenium_Grid
[02:16:46] stephend|out: BW^-: browsers are specified (versions, paths)
[02:17:04] stephend|out: in a config file, then we launch with pytestmozwebqa, via Jenkins, and send to Grid
[02:17:23] stephend|out: we have hooks to call out to Sauce Labs
[02:19:03] BW^-: aha
[02:19:53] stephend|out: we can do either/both

[02:34:03] BW^-: as to isntall teh XPI on OpenBSD, its install.rdf file needs  the following line       <em:targetPlatform>OpenBSD</em:targetPlatform>
[02:34:12] BW^-: otherwise the browser says the Firefox version is bad :)
[02:34:37] BW^-: so that would be a good thing to add
