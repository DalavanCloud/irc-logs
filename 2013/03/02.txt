[03:00:40] Dude-X_: AutomatedTester, Newark to NYC via NJ Transit Rail is 12.50 USD (it can be cheaper  if you do rail to Newark, then PATH) but it's easier to take the Rail to New York Penn Station, then take the A/C/E train to 14th Street and then walk to Google

[10:22:46] arex\: Does the C# bindings not come with a PageFactory class?
[10:23:07] arex\: Nvm, found it.
[10:27:06] arex\: I had my own namespace ending in PageObjects which was messing things up :)
[10:31:05] arex\: Hmm. Looks like I have to use OpenQA.Selenium.Support.PageObjects.PageFactory.InitElements() instead of PageFactory.InitElements()
