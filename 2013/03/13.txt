[10:10:47] millenium_: I know that //td search for all td tags but is it not like CssSelector searching only in the WebElement html source?
[10:11:28] millenium_: the funny thing is that once of every 10 times it get this kind of result
[10:11:45] Phil37: is currentCard another webelement?

[11:49:34] andreastt: Well, his approach makes sense too.
[11:49:35] barancev|2: who wants to write xpath queries in this style?
[11:49:51] andreastt: Well then, did you see mine?
[11:50:10] barancev|2: yes, that's what we discussed on the channel
[11:50:34] barancev|2: automatic collection of namespaces can have perormance impact
[11:51:03] andreastt: k, just making sure I didn't miss any of it.
[11:51:15] barancev|2: API is not as smooth as automated solution
[11:51:21] barancev|2: what to choose?
[11:51:32] andreastt: I guess the right course of action would be for us to do some testing.
[11:51:48] andreastt: I can create a few tests for it later today, I think.
[11:52:08] barancev|2: it would be good to make some benchmarking, yes

[11:52:53] andreastt: Sure, I'll sync up with you then.
[11:53:02] andreastt: I think this is important to get right in the spec.

[12:41:55] intchanter: AutomatedTester: Is pytestopts= a decent name for a new option to pass to ./go ?
[12:42:14] AutomatedTester: intchanter: what options?
[12:42:57] intchanter: I'm currently using pytestopts='--pdb' to make pytest.py drop to the debugger when it hits a failed assertion.
[12:43:08] intchanter: But it could also be used to specify a single test file.
[12:43:18] intchanter: Or combine those.
[12:43:39] AutomatedTester: method= does individual tests
[12:44:05] AutomatedTester: can you get --pdb to work since I found that rake wouldnt hand over control
[12:44:35] intchanter: It doesn't hand over control, but for my purposes being able to get the pdb trace has been sufficient so far.
[12:44:41] mreedell-work has joined #selenium
[12:44:57] AutomatedTester: I would just call it options
[12:44:57] intchanter: That may be a query for simonstewart when he gets in.
[12:45:30] AutomatedTester: intchanter: I asked jarib who has done a lot of the crazyfun ruby stuff and the answer was  "doesnt python have a remote debugger"
[12:46:09] intchanter: I think it's pdb.
[12:46:16] AutomatedTester: by ruby stuff I mean "took what Simon did and made it real ruby"
[12:46:27] AutomatedTester: pdb is remote now?
[12:46:32] *AutomatedTester must have missed that
[12:46:37] intchanter: I think it can operate that way as well.
[12:46:54] intchanter: But that's just based on a vague memory of seeing something in the docs.
[12:47:40] AutomatedTester: I have seen people make their own remote one
[12:47:45] AutomatedTester: but there is no built in one
[12:48:47] AutomatedTester: anyway
[12:48:51] AutomatedTester: options will be fine
[12:48:55] intchanter: If I did call it options=, how would ./go know which tool(s) to pass it to?
[12:49:15] AutomatedTester: well you would need to make sure it understood what was passed in
[12:50:14] intchanter: Oh, so not just hand it over as-is, but interpret the specific options and translate them to something for the specific tool.
[12:50:22] AutomatedTester: yea

[13:12:55] intchanter: I should really spend a bit of time and finally pick up Ruby and its little differences.  For example, is :foo the same as 'foo', or is it only guaranteed to be different from any other :bar in representation?
[13:13:10] rananda has joined #selenium
[13:14:32] llaskin: why would a symbol :foo be the same as foo
[13:14:38] llaskin: foo.to_sym == :foo
[13:15:26] aweiteka has joined #selenium
[13:15:42] intchanter: I've seen those referenced as being "lightweight strings" somewhere.
[13:16:22] intchanter: But it sounds like they're closer to symbol table entries, so the name would only exist at parsing time?
[13:16:28] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[13:18:11] llaskin: what do you mean by "name exist only at parsing time"?
[13:20:07] intchanter: In that case, the parser would replace :foo with some (short?) token that would be the real index into a mapping/dictionary/associative array.
[13:20:51] llaskin: yes i think
[13:20:57] llaskin: though this might be a question for #ruby-lang or #ruby
[13:21:12] intchanter: Probably.

[14:22:51] andreastt: That's splendid news.
[14:23:08] andreastt: So are they going to hire you to maintain them? (-;
[14:23:16] jarib: AutomatedTester: i have not done a lot of the crazyfun ruby stuff, i don't want the blame for that code :P
[14:23:19] jimevans: hah!
[14:23:30] AutomatedTester: jarib: sorry, I thought you had :)
[14:23:34] RossPatterson: Really cool to see that.  Weird that it's almost six months ago - I'd hope they'd be getting involved in the interim.
[14:23:39] jarib: jimevans: wow!
[14:23:43] AutomatedTester: jarib: I know it makes you angry and thought you went through and fixed it
[14:24:16] jimevans: to be completely honest, the .net bindings are remarkably stable. there are very few changes that get made in them from release to release.
[14:24:19] jarib: nope :)
[14:24:58] jimevans: and as long as we're being completely honest, i'd really really *really* like msft to be looking after the IE driver, or at least providing input to it.
[14:25:36] jimevans: but, i'll take what i can get.
[14:25:59] jimevans: and it means that code i've written is "officially endorsed" by msft. :)
[14:26:16] Phil37: that's great
[14:26:27] Phil37: maybe in a few years IE driver will outperform FF?
[14:26:28] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the Visual Studio team are supposedly going to be sending us diffs :)

[14:46:00] jimevans: nirvdrum: no worries. it's replaceable, i think.
[14:46:23] nirvdrum: jimevans: Why do you want to drop ATL?  Just to reduce binary size?
[14:46:44] jimevans: to allow people to compile the IE driver with only visual c++ express edition.
[14:46:52] nirvdrum: Oh.  That sucks.
[14:47:06] nirvdrum: I thought as of VS 2010 they were adding it in.
[14:47:20] nirvdrum: In any case, I think the only thing I really used it for was creating the PNG.
[14:47:31] nirvdrum: The Win32 API is quite obtuse when it comes to that.

[14:56:31] intchanter-work: Yes, very nice to have.

[14:56:54] jimevans: intchanter-work: i know, right? actually, i concur with nirvdrum on this one, but hey, i'm all about lowering barriers to entry if it means even a minute increase in the chances someone else will start looking at the code.
[14:56:59] nirvdrum: The number of people building IEDriver on their own numbers in the < 10 I would imagine.
[14:58:30] *garndt saves Jim's quote about removing ATL for future reference :)
[14:59:10] jimevans: garndt: i might attempt it. didn't say i'd succeed. there's some fundamental architecture that i'm going to have to radically rethink.
[14:59:56] jimevans: but i think i have a working build removing all of the CComPtr, CComBSTR and CComVariant references, which is a good start.

[15:00:12] garndt: *high five*
[15:00:31] nirvdrum: So much for my plan of replacing SnapsIE with IEDriver then :-P
[15:00:54] jimevans: nirvdrum: ?
[15:01:02] nirvdrum: I was thinking since we already ship IEDriver and it already includes most of SnapsIE, may as well lower the barrier there.
[15:01:24] nirvdrum: But SnapsIE needs to be invoked via JS, so it needs to be IDispatch compatible.
[15:01:34] nirvdrum: I have zero interest in dealing with raw VARIANT.
[15:02:01] stephend has joined #selenium
[15:02:10] jimevans: nirvdrum: so don't. use _variant_t. it's a smart pointer compatible wrapper class, but doesn't require ATL.
[15:03:24] jimevans: the biggest change is that _com_ptr_t throws instead of just returning an HRESULT, but that's not too bad.
[15:03:28] nirvdrum: I'm unaware of that.  But it handles marshaling the types correctly?
[15:03:39] jimevans: nirvdrum: should do.
[15:03:48] nirvdrum: Cool.  I'll have to read up on that then.

[15:25:34] nirvdrum: jimevans: Pardon my ignorance, but how do you get the type out of this?  Just cast it?
[15:25:52] nirvdrum: There's not much in way of member functions.
[15:28:01] jimevans: you can use an operator like int(v), where v is a _variant_t. you can also to v.vt, which exposes the normal VARIANT fields.

[18:48:03] jimevans: you can't have 9 and 10 installed.
[18:48:11] jimevans: it's an unsupported configuration.

[19:44:02] lukeis: itsmikerudolph: are you clicking the option?
[19:44:10] itsmikerudolph: yup
[19:44:12] lukeis: if so, it should fire the event
[19:44:25] lukeis: :sssce
[19:44:26] itsmikerudolph: I see the option get selected in the page
[19:44:32] itsmikerudolph: but the change event does not fire

[19:45:42] lukeis: itsmikerudolph: a reproducible test case would be helpful :)
