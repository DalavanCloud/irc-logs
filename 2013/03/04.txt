[10:12:38] RaulFR has joined #selenium
[10:12:52] RaulFR: hello :-)
[10:15:02] Ardesco has joined #selenium
[10:17:10] RaulFR: I am running WebDriver 2.29.0, and running into problems with a Java driven implementation that used to work perfectly. Even the semple test at http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp#introducing-the-selenium-webdriver-api-by-example fails, at line WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); with an exception " org.openqa.selenium.remote.UnreachableBrowserException: Could not start a...
[10:17:11] RaulFR: ...new session. Possible causes are invalid address of the remote server or browser start-up failure." and the trace saying "Caused by: java.net.SocketException: Connection reset"
[10:17:23] RaulFR: simple*
[10:18:02] Ardesco: which version of FireFox?  19?
[10:18:09] Ardesco: if so you need Selenium 2.31.0
[10:18:40] Ardesco: Stuff changed in FF19 which caused some issues with version of Selenium older than 2.30.0
[10:19:06] RaulFR: I am running this on a computer where an updated Firefox installation sits together with a Firefox 18.0.1, and using profiles to chose the correct Firefox for running my Selenium WebDriver
[10:19:39] RaulFR: yes Firefox 19 (for browsing) on one side, and 18.0.1 for Selenium
[10:20:03] Ardesco: the error sounds like the bug with 2.29.0 and FF19
[10:20:13] Ardesco: FF18 should work fine with 2.29.0
[10:20:20] Ardesco: are you sure it's loading FF18
[10:20:37] Ardesco: or you could just update to 2.31.0
[10:21:46] RaulFR: the path for FF18 is passed  to the driver using System.setProperty("webdriver.firefox.profile", "mySeleniumProfile") and System.setProperty("webdriver.firefox.bin","c:/path/to/FF18/binary/firefox.exe")
[10:23:11] RaulFR: when I run the Java program from Eclipse, the exception is thrown at  line WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); neverthless the Firefox window is indeed opened with the "Webdriver" word on the bottom right (though it remains blank)
[10:23:34] RaulFR: when I open the ? - Help menu, it indeed displays that the version is 18.0.1
[10:23:47] Ardesco: Windows needs \\ in paths not /
[10:24:02] Ardesco: I suspect it's not finding it in the path you supplied and then going looking in the default place
[10:24:07] Ardesco: and picking up FF19
[10:24:13] RaulFR: yes Ardesco, they are indeed \\
[10:24:19] Ardesco: OK in that case it is FF18
[10:24:59] RaulFR: no, it is 18.0.1 that indeed gets started, I can see it in the help window
[10:25:34] Ardesco: so it does open FF
[10:25:40] RaulFR: strange thing is that Selenium throws the exception, and at the same time opens the FF18
[10:25:57] RaulFR: yes, it is opened, but stays blank, since Selenium is halted by the exception
[10:26:22] Ardesco: strange
[10:26:41] Ardesco: if you don't specify a profile does it work?
[10:27:15] RaulFR: I have tried many combinations. I'll try again that (I think I have already tried it)
[10:28:12] RaulFR: yes, same error
[10:28:37] RaulFR: without the webriver.fiefox.profile set
[10:28:42] RaulFR: firefox*
[10:29:24] RaulFR: I am trying to maintain an environment where I know that the WebDriver will work, i.e. Firefoix 18.0.1 and Selenium 2.29.0 despite any changes in Firefox
[10:30:16] RaulFR: I did set the Firefox 18.0.1 profile not to update Firefox 18.0.1, so Webdrive will run reliably
[10:30:58] Ardesco: I'm guessing this is something AutomatedTester may be better placed to help with
[10:31:26] Ardesco: I'm wondering if there are any core components that get updated with a FF19 install that all FF versions would use on windows
[10:31:37] *Ardesco is guessing like mad here
[10:31:58] Ardesco: I would try selenium 2.31.0 and see if that fixes it
[10:32:19] RaulFR: yes, well, it obviously has something to do with the Firefox updating itself
[10:32:19] Ardesco: if so my guess is something shared between the 2 FF versions has been updated
[10:32:33] RaulFR: I will try updating to Selenium 2.31.0, but that's a bit frustrating, because it looks like I can't set a stable envrioment for the Webdrive to run
[10:32:51] Ardesco: as I said I'm just guessing here
[10:32:55] RaulFR: unless, I set Firefox not to update itself, never
[10:33:07] RaulFR: (even profiles not used by Selenium)
[10:34:03] Ardesco: I haven't personally seen that issue, but I don't run multiple versions of FF on the same box
[10:36:17] RaulFR: just out of curiosity, about your own practice. If you have any Webdriver programs in a production environment, how to you deal with browser updates ?
[10:37:00] *RaulFR is still developing the app, not yet in production
[10:38:36] RaulFR: Ardesco: anyway, thanks for your insights. I will update Webdriver and come back to tell if things have back to normal. If AutomatedTester sees these messages and can give some light into this, it would be greatly appreciated.
[10:38:48] RaulFR: I will stay in the channel in the meantime
[10:38:57] RaulFR: thanks again :-)
[10:39:18] *RaulFR will brb
[10:39:56] vila has joined #selenium
[10:40:06] Ardesco: We run FireFox LTS on CI
[10:40:24] Ardesco: and update FF and Selenium locally as updates come out
[10:40:44] Ardesco: our tests are all run locally before we do a push anyway
[10:40:50] Ardesco: if the tests fail the push doesn't happen
[10:41:20] Ardesco: so the only thing that should go wrong on CI is incompatibilities due to env
[10:41:26] Ardesco: in theory ;)
[10:51:36] RaulFR: Ardesco: thanks, that's helpful .. so I guess you mean Firefox ESR (http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all.html)
[10:52:24] RaulFR: which is currently Firefox 17.0.3esr
[10:53:19] Ardesco: yup
[10:53:21] RaulFR: and with that, you update Selenium with the latest version as it comes
[10:53:27] Ardesco: yup
[10:53:36] Ardesco: we are running 2.31.0 atm
[10:53:45] RaulFR: :-) ok, I see
[10:54:26] RaulFR: provided I am able to automate that, that sounds like a very sound approach

[11:17:05] RaulFR: well, I have upgraded to 2.31.0n and was able to run the basic test Google, cheese from  http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp#introducing-the-selenium-webdriver-api-by-example (i.e. without selecting any particular profile or any particular binary), and it ran successfully
[11:18:14] RaulFR: then I tried my code, which sets the webdriver.firefox.bin and webdriver.firefox.profile
[11:18:52] RaulFR: and it failed with the same exception as earlier org.openqa.selenium.remote.UnreachableBrowserException: Could not start a new session. Possible causes are invalid address of the remote server or browser start-up failure.
[11:19:04] RaulFR: and saying : "Caused by: java.net.SocketException: Connection reset"
[11:19:23] RaulFR: then I retried the bare simple code Google - cheese
[11:19:38] RaulFR: and it does not work any longer
[11:19:56] RaulFR: failing again with the same exception described above
[11:22:28] RaulFR: Ardesco: so, Webdriver 2.31 properly launched Firefox 19 after Webdriver upgrade, but when I tried making it start Firefox 18.0.1 with a profile delected, if failed, and afterwards, Webdriver 2.31 cannot launch Firefox 19 anymore
[11:23:02] Ardesco: that sounds like you have some weird stuff going on with the two FF versions

[13:44:03] RaulFR: I did this with no luck: delete all profiles except the default, uninstall the 18.0.1 alternate version, uninstall FF 19 and reinstall

[13:44:50] llaskin has joined #selenium
[13:44:53] RaulFR: but.. 
[13:45:46] RaulFR: I have noticed that WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); fails with the exception "org.openqa.selenium.remote.UnreachableBrowserException: Could not start a new session. Possible causes are invalid address of the remote server or browser start-up failure."
[13:45:55] RaulFR: only when my project is run from Eclipse
[13:46:11] RaulFR: when I export it as an executable .jar file
[13:46:38] RaulFR: then, the same project is able to run Webdrive, and that exception is not triggered
[13:48:50] RaulFR: so, my current situation is: with Webdriver 2.31.0, Firefox 17.0.3 (esr), onely one profile (default), and the plain simple code from the documentation to open a Google page
[13:50:11] RaulFR: when ruin from Eclipse, I get org.openqa.selenium.remote.UnreachableBrowserException (with reported cause Caused by: java.net.SocketException: Connection reset), and when run from a generated standalone .jar, no exception and creation of the WebDriver instance succeeds
[13:50:14] RaulFR: run*
[13:50:52] Phil37 has joined #selenium
[13:53:09] *RaulFR has no idea as to why the project cannot be run anymore from Eclipse :-(

[13:55:06] Ardesco: which makes me point the finger at it ;)
[13:55:28] Ardesco: if it's running find on the command line it implies that it's not a Selenium problem

[15:47:44] nirvdrum: wwwwwllllo: If the cert isn't valid, the browser simply won't load the page (on most drivers).  On the drivers where it does load, the browser doesn't have a means to query for the info about the cert anyway.
[15:48:16] wwwwwllllo: nirvdrum: it's not that the cert isn't valid. It's that not all elements on the page are https

[15:49:06] nirvdrum: wwwwwllllo: Well, that wouldn't be a broken SSL certificate.
[15:49:52] wwwwwllllo: nirvdrum: ok, my bad. I should have been more specifc. Can I detect that?
[15:49:53] jimevans: AutomatedTester: oh, it sees the element as visible, sure, but what if you try to click at the center-point and the center point can't be scrolled into view because the element is too large? what does click() do?
[15:50:10] AutomatedTester: click it
[15:50:15] jimevans: where?
[15:50:28] AutomatedTester: the center is still fine
[15:50:39] AutomatedTester: since the events will still bubble like before
[15:50:44] jimevans: with native events, how do you click a point that's not on the screen?
[15:50:47] nirvdrum: wwwwwllllo: Even that I don't think you can do.  Each browser does different things about mixed-content warnings and I don't believe any of the drivers allow you to dismiss them.  Your best bet is probably to use BrowserMob Proxy to intercept the traffic and interrogate that afterwards.
[15:50:57] jimevans: or more correctly, is below the view port of the browser?
[15:51:26] AutomatedTester: jimevans: in that case you need to calculate the area in the viewport and click that
[15:51:46] jimevans: does firefox do that at the moment?
[15:51:49] AutomatedTester: synthetic events are easier
[15:51:59] AutomatedTester: um dunno, never tried with native events
[15:52:07] AutomatedTester: does with synthetic events
[15:52:12] wwwwwllllo: nirvdrum: I don't want to dismiss them, I want to detect them
[15:52:43] nirvdrum: wwwwwllllo: Well, if you can't dismiss it, your browser session will hang.
[15:52:51] nirvdrum: So, you do want to dismiss them at some level.
[15:53:05] jimevans: the bug occurs in IE, where native events are the default, that the element is visible, but the point the driver wants to click on isn't in the viewport, and calling scrollIntoView on the element doesn't put that center point in the view port.
[15:53:07] cartuned has joined #selenium
[15:53:17] jimevans: i believe it happens in firefox with native events too.
[15:53:52] jimevans: or so #4390 would appear to  imply
[15:54:07] AutomatedTester: unfortunately we are going to have to do some hard work here to find out where to click
[15:54:13] AutomatedTester: soz
[15:55:09] AutomatedTester: we definitely need to click it though
[15:55:16] jimevans: so the spec should say what the behavior is when the "middle of the element" (as defined in the spec) can't be scrolled into view.
[15:55:23] jimevans: the workaround, of course, is to use Actions.
[15:55:40] jimevans: which gives much more precise control over where in the element to clikc.
[15:55:44] jimevans: or click even
[15:55:45] andreastt: nirvdrum: Well it works.  But not ideally.
[15:56:00] AutomatedTester: jimevans: definitely
[15:56:22] nirvdrum: andreastt: I wasn't even seeing the viewport.  It seems to have just stopped sending me bytes after about 2K.
[15:56:36] jimevans: i suspect simonstewart would say "click() is a convenience. if it doesn't work, Actions is the way to go," but we should definitely ask him.
[15:56:49] andreastt: nirvdrum: I've never heard of that before.
[15:56:56] andreastt: Anyways, it returns the visible viewport.
[15:57:07] andreastt: Which is basically a dump of the browser's internal framebuffer.
[15:57:09] nirvdrum: andreastt: Should I file a separate issue then?
[15:57:20] AutomatedTester: jimevans: well this is where Simon and I will disagree
[15:57:26] AutomatedTester: if he says that
[15:57:29] andreastt: If you manage to reproduce it, you could.  But noone is working on the Presto-OperaDriver anymore.
[15:58:03] nirvdrum: andreastt: Okay.  I guess I won't bother then.
[15:58:16] jimevans: AutomatedTester: it makes the rules associated with "click()" a lot harder to follow.
[15:59:00] AutomatedTester: jimevans: unfortunately with CSS3 this is going to happen more than you think
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Mar  4 16:00:13 2013]
[16:00:13] AutomatedTester: and forcing people to do actions because its simpler for us, in my humble opinion, is not the right approach
[16:00:24] jimevans: seems arbitrary to me to say "click() clicks in the middle of the element. except when the middle of the element is not able to be scrolled into the view port by scrollIntoView(), in which case, we'll click *somewhere* that *is* visible in the view port." 
[16:00:48] AutomatedTester: we already have a special case for links
[16:00:49] jimevans: where "somewhere" is arbitrarily defined.

[16:03:06] andreastt: nirvdrum: Yes.
[16:03:44] nirvdrum: Wait. Not a joke?
[16:04:01] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: its Chromium under the hood...
[16:04:10] jimevans: i mean, i'll implement whatever the spec dictates (because god knows nobody else will for IE), but i'm not sure arbitrary locations are the right approach.
[16:04:19] nirvdrum: I thought it was just the rendering engine.
[16:04:26] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: and the JS
[16:04:29] nirvdrum: Oh.
[16:04:33] nirvdrum: Well, how about that.
[16:04:36] andreastt: nirvdrum: We're reusing large portions of Chromium.
[16:04:45] nirvdrum: For some reason I thought it was just webkit.
[16:04:52] AutomatedTester: nope...
[16:04:52] andreastt: Well, on some platforms it's just WebKit.
[16:05:00] andreastt: iOS, Android are two examples.
[16:05:17] jimevans: nirvdrum: the new chromedriver (being developed right now) leverages the webkit remote debugging protocol.

[16:07:58] nirvdrum: I already made it work with Chrome and Safari.
[16:08:08] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the arbitrary point will either have to be calculated by the user or by us
[16:08:27] AutomatedTester: jimevans: and I, as much as it pains me, think we should do the heavy lifting

My setup is as follows, 1 EC2 Ubuntu instance running the hub, 1 EC2 Windows Server 2008 Instance running a node, my local dev box pushing a script to the hub. I can connect the node to the hub just fine, and when I push out my script to the hub from my dev box, it will run the first command. After that, the session times out and the scri
[17:17:04] simonstewart: And I don't know how I feel about "storing run-time data externally from the script in the form of a spreadsheet, database or other data  le is an industry recognized best practice"

[17:19:38] garndt: I cringed when I saw this paper this morning
[17:19:55] simonstewart: Does the process you use for writing selenium tests look anything like the one described in the paper?
[17:20:03] simonstewart: And do you need to test on mobile and chrome?
[17:21:03] garndt: I do not need to test on mobile or chrome and my process is "1. open up sublime text 2. 2. start writing script"
[17:21:17] simonstewart: Ohhh… that "Staffing" section is just plain rude: "Don't train your QA 'resources' to program because then they won't want to do QA". I may be misreading.
[17:21:35] simonstewart: Then the comparison they're making is bogus in your case
[17:21:37] simonstewart: :)
[17:22:18] garndt: simonstewart: as bogus as most things are in this paper, it will not stop the rugrats from trying to cause a ruckus :)

[17:33:21] garndt: jimevans: I can come up with an intelligent answer, but I do not think that people with the mindset of not writing code for automated tests are open to changing their opinions.  That is where the communication significantly breaks down.  I was on a call with some QTP folks and a demo was going on about how C# dlls can be imported into QTP...one of the people
[17:33:21] garndt: on the call said "just show me it work because I don't understand this new fangled script stuff"  I wish I was just paraphrasing that

[17:35:12] jimevans: garndt: it's hard to break that mindset. it seems like it ought to be simple. in the course of testing my application, i do some user interactions. how hard can it be to track those interactions with the application, and just play them back whenever i want to?

[17:52:59] AppleJack_: I figured out what my issue was with Grid2 and my EC2 machines (I feel stupid now). By default the hubConfig sets the host to Null. I made a config file, set the host name, referenced the file when starting the hub, and now it works.
[17:53:09] admc1 has joined #selenium
[17:53:35] nirvdrum: jarib: Although, I was thinking of going the other way.  Allow all drivers to pass in capabilities as part of the options hash, and just continue to support the :desired_capabilities key.
[17:54:00] nirvdrum: So I could do something like: Selenium::WebDriver.for :android, :accept_ssl_certs => true
[17:54:59] jarib: and that would end up in the capabilities as acceptSslCerts 
[17:55:08] nirvdrum: Right.
[17:55:29] nirvdrum: Android ignores the opts keys if they're not one of [:url, :desired_capabilities]
[17:55:51] jarib: that's nice, but what about the places where we already do "key translation" today
[17:55:56] nirvdrum: Not a big deal.  If all the drivers support :desired_capabilities, I can just adopt that convention, even if it is a bit longer.
[17:56:21] nirvdrum: Well, all the existing places would continue to work.  Unless there's a name clash with a capability name.

[18:08:09] jarib: nirvdrum: our jruby jar is a custom build with various gems included
[18:08:27] jimevans: simonstewart: .net fails when you update jruby?
[18:08:36] simonstewart: yeah
[18:08:43] nirvdrum: jarib: Why bundle into your own JAR?  You can require gems easily enough.
[18:08:46] simonstewart: Something to do with not being able to require the albacore stuff
[18:09:08] simonstewart: I looked at it a reasonably long time ago
[18:09:18] nirvdrum: Sorry.  If there's a doc on this, feel free to tell me to RTFM.
[18:09:18] simonstewart: Or "two weeks ish" as it's otherwise called
[18:09:21] jarib: nirvdrum: i know, but simonstewart didn't at the time
[18:09:36] jarib: so now we do both
[18:09:37] simonstewart: I'm always happy to improve the process
[18:09:48] simonstewart: How much effort would it be to do the sane thing?
[18:09:51] jarib: i suggest we use a vanilla jruby build and keep jar dependencies external

[18:10:14] simonstewart: Who's going to Make It So?
[18:10:31] jarib: i can do that
[18:10:36] simonstewart: Sweet.
[18:10:46] simonstewart: I'd suggest keeping the same revision of jruby to start with
[18:10:53] jarib: it involves packing our gem dependencies as jars though
[18:10:56] jarib: will do
[18:11:07] simonstewart: Are there docs on how to do that packing?
[18:11:28] jarib: they're easily written :)
[18:11:54] simonstewart: :google jruby packing gems into jars
[18:11:55] jarib: alternatively we could not pack them, but that's a lot of source code added to the tree

[19:39:41] jarib: ok
[19:39:57] simonstewart: It seems like a meaningful piece of work that provides a handy check point
[19:40:33] jarib: yeah, just thinking about the big binary blob churn in the repo
[19:40:43] jarib: perhaps less of an issue than i think it is.
[19:41:23] simonstewart: I'm not concerned about that. There's going to be a bit of a shock, and then we'll be back to normal

[19:43:35] jarib: it's a wrapper around webdriver afaict
[19:44:01] simonstewart: Fits in the same niche as capybara

[20:00:39] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: are your slides and video from your tech talk up?
[20:01:22] jimevans: oh, hey, simonstewart's here! so AutomatedTester and i were having a discussion earlier and wanted your thoughts.
[20:01:24] simonstewart: Nope.
[20:01:31] simonstewart: jimevans: ok
[20:01:36] garndt: ugh, sometimes I just regret responding to a post on selenium-users...I knew I should have kept my mouth shut heh
[20:01:40] simonstewart: The nope was to whether my slides were up
[20:01:50] simonstewart: They make no sense without me wittering on above them
[20:01:54] simonstewart: (as is my wont)
[20:02:15] jimevans: webelement.click(). if the element is too big for the center point of the element to be scrolled into the view port when calling scrollIntoView(), what should happen?
[20:02:37] simonstewart: garndt: the se-users list tends to have the people who are less experienced. It takes a little more patience to be happy there
[20:03:00] simonstewart: jimevans: wat?
[20:03:02] simonstewart: *sigh*
[20:03:12] jimevans: webelement.click() clicks the center of the element, yes?
[20:03:16] simonstewart: Yes
[20:03:21] simonstewart: I got the question
[20:03:28] simonstewart: I was just wondering who'd hit that particular issue
[20:03:42] jimevans: i'm thinking something like findElement(By.tagName("body")).click()
[20:04:01] jimevans: yeah, it's silly, but we have an issue report on it.
[20:04:23] AutomatedTester: it doesnt need to be something that large, if you have a transformX: which transforms the center off the screen and we cant scroll to it
[20:04:33] simonstewart: My knee jerk response is to get them to use the advacned user interactions api
[20:05:17] AutomatedTester: so this is where jimevans and I have differing opinions
[20:05:19] jimevans: that's what i thought you'd say.
[20:06:12] AutomatedTester: if you have something that is using a transform and transitions onto the area we are now have an element that you can see but cant click
[20:06:27] AutomatedTester: so isShown goes "yes this is visible" but click just errors
[20:06:55] AutomatedTester: so now you need to build a chain, workout how much is visible, and then try offset the mouse and then click
[20:07:36] AutomatedTester: this to me seems like a 10lb hammer to break a nut
[20:07:43] AutomatedTester: from a users point of view
[20:07:49] AutomatedTester: when all they want is click()
[20:09:10] jimevans: and i say that's fine as far as it goes, but let's strictly define where that click will occur, in that case.
[20:09:33] jimevans: because the positioning seems arbitrary to me.
[20:10:16] AutomatedTester: well, we know the size of the element, we know its location
[20:10:51] AutomatedTester: from that we work out where it is in the viewport and the part that is, just click the centre of that
[20:12:07] jimevans: fine. but let's update the spec to define "middle of the element" to be that.
[20:12:29] AutomatedTester: sounds good to me
[20:13:12] Pavan_ has joined #selenium
[20:14:28] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I will drop ^ into the bug so we dont forget, and leaves nothing to interpretation
[20:14:43] AutomatedTester: jimevans: and then would you mind reviewing?
[20:14:48] jarib: what's the issue #?
[20:15:30] jimevans: so is "middle of the element" defined as "midway along the x- and y-axes of the visible portion of the element after being scrolled into the viewport?" or "midway along the x- and y-axes of the visible portion of the element after beings scrolled into the viewport if and only if the center point of the bounding client rect of the element is not within the viewport?
[20:15:32] jimevans: "
[20:15:38] jarib: jimevans: any idea if we depend on a specific version of albacore?
[20:15:45] jimevans: jarib: we shouldn't
[20:17:03] jarib: i'm attempting a jruby update
[20:17:18] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I think the latter would be my prefered wording
[20:17:38] AutomatedTester: but either really...
[20:17:53] jarib: jimevans: i'll just stick to the version we have now at first (0.2.6), but it will be easy to upgrade to the latest (0.3.5) after, i'm pulling the gem deps out of the jruby jar
[20:18:08] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i'd prefer the latter. only go fiddling about with the "visible part within the viewport" if the actual center isn't scrolled into view.
[20:18:38] jimevans: jarib: whatever you think is best. as far as i'm aware there's no specific version dependencies there.
[20:18:52] AutomatedTester: jimevans: agreed

[22:46:37] jimevans: says it's in Rakefile:15 (i assume that's line 15), which is requiring android.rb
[22:47:00] jarib: hm
[22:47:09] jarib: sounds like i need to set up some windows vms
[22:47:24] jarib: had to wipe my machine a few days ago, so all of that is gone
[22:47:46] jarib: jimevans: can you try the target again quickly with --trace?
[22:47:52] jimevans: commenting that include gets further along to where we require rake-tasks/ci, which says "no such file to load -- json"
[22:47:59] jarib: oh, hm
[22:48:37] jarib: try adding `-r third_party\jruby\gems\json_pure.jar` to ./go.bat
[22:49:25] jarib: we'll need to make this a bit cleaner later on anyway
[22:49:53] jimevans: bah. commenting the android mappings just makes for headaches later on.
[22:50:01] jimevans: gotta resolve that.
[22:50:11] jimevans: getting a backtrace
[22:51:11] santiycr: jimevans:  that would be a good way to communicate around this

[22:53:39] jimevans: jarib: https://gist.github.com/jimevans/5086435
[22:54:06] jarib: ah, interesting
[22:55:11] jarib: jimevans: what platform are you on?
[22:55:20] jimevans: windows 7. x64.
[22:56:03] jarib: java -version?
[22:56:18] jimevans: 1.6.0_31
[22:56:55] jarib: ok. you could try to grab http://jruby.org.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/1.7.3/jruby-complete-1.7.3.jar and move it to third_party/jruby/jruby-complete.jar and see if that helps
[22:57:04] jarib: this is just an intermediate step before i actually push 1.7.3..
[22:57:25] jarib: so if that works flawlessly, i may just do that
[22:59:19] jimevans: okay, now i see "no such file to load -- third_party/jruby/gems/albacore.
[22:59:21] jimevans: "
[22:59:45] jimevans: which is weird because i have albacore.jar in that directory
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Mar  4 23:00:00 2013]
[23:00:00] jarib: hm
[23:00:19] jarib: with the 1.7.3 jar it's running in ruby 1.9 mode and needs a ./ in front - ./third_party/jruby/gems/albacore.jar
[23:00:46] jimevans: in the command line?
[23:00:50] jarib: (the current directory is no longer on ruby's $LOAD_PATH in 1.9)
[23:01:03] jarib: yeah, probably in go.bat?
[23:01:15] jimevans: trying it now
[23:01:28] jarib: thanks, you rock
[23:01:59] jimevans: looks like success to me so far.
[23:02:16] jarib: android commented in and everything?
[23:02:43] jimevans: yep my only changes are the updated jruby jar and the changes to go.bat.
[23:03:23] jarib: ok, that's good news
[23:03:58] jimevans: just need '.\
[23:04:03] jimevans: bah.
[23:04:17] jimevans: just need '.\' in front of all of the required reference .jars.
[23:04:20] jimevans: (in go.bat)
[23:04:32] jimevans: and now, gotta run.

[23:23:08] Firebalrog: I am having trouble connecting to opera from my selenium nunit test. I tried a few ports after running netstat but I think I am doing something wrong.
[23:23:38] Firebalrog: I have started the dedicated server and the safari, chrome, firefox, IE i have gotten working.
[23:23:59] Firebalrog: i did new OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.RemoteWebDriver(new Uri("http://localhost:4500"), OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.DesiredCapabilities.Opera()); 
[23:24:11] Firebalrog: and used various ports instead of 4500 
[23:24:16] Firebalrog: any ideas

[23:28:27] Firebalrog: simon any experience with using opera and selenium
[23:29:01] Firebalrog: new OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.RemoteWebDriver(new Uri("http://localhost:4500"), OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.DesiredCapabilities.Opera());  is not working for me when it tries to connect I assume it is the wrong port.
[23:31:31] Firebalrog: i think I see what may be the problem. OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.DesiredCapabilities.Opera() should be a variable with various properties assigned to it such as opera path.
[23:31:46] Firebalrog: and specify the port. Will try it tomorrow
