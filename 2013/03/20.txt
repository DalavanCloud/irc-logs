[12:31:41] AutomatedTester: jarib:  there is a patch for multi file upload on Github
[12:31:48] AutomatedTester: thought you might be interested

[12:32:53] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[12:33:02] jarib: so i guess we should advice him to add a java test for it?

[12:35:27] jarib: actually, let's move the discussion to the PR
[12:35:58] jarib: this is one of the capybara contributors, he may be happier if he can add the test to the ruby specs

[12:44:44] Turzai: hi! is the error message "Error determining if element is displayed" a common thing while using IEDriver?

[12:47:52] barancev: like "why can't selenium click this element on this page"
[12:53:41] jarib: AutomatedTester, barancev: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/34 - feel free to join in on the discussion
[12:54:35] AutomatedTester: jarib: does it work in Chrome?

[15:39:38] SupplyCrawler: So, I downloaded the new linux chromedriver executable, but now it's telling me "ChromeDriver executable needs to be available in the path..." 
[15:39:47] SupplyCrawler: The older version wasn't complaining. Kind of confused.
[15:39:55] davehunt has joined #selenium
[15:41:20] ryanpetr_ has joined #selenium
[15:43:13] nirvdrum: SupplyCrawler: It's always needed to be in the path, as far as I know.
[15:43:33] lukeis: yeah, something's not quite right with chromedriver2
[15:43:36] nirvdrum: I got that message just recently with ChromeDriver 1.  I'm not sure how it would find the executable otherwise.
[15:43:39] SupplyCrawler: But I swapped the executables out in the same place. Weird.
[15:43:40] lukeis: i just tried it and it didn't find it
[15:43:50] SupplyCrawler: Well, actually
[15:43:58] SupplyCrawler: I didn't have it in the path, I was pointing do it in the code 
[15:44:02] SupplyCrawler: to it *
[15:44:05] nirvdrum: Ahh.
[15:44:11] lukeis: i get "unknown error: no chrome binary "
[15:44:27] lukeis: looks like it wants chrome to be in a different place
[15:44:27] jimevans: lukeis: what language bindings?
[15:44:30] lukeis: python
[15:44:57] jimevans: lukeis: please hold caller.
[15:44:59] lukeis: do i need the dev channel of chrome?
[15:45:49] jimevans: what does python send for the chrome.binary capability if it's not explicitly set?
[15:46:24] Dude-X_: i think chromedriver 2 works with v26 and above. release version is at 25
[15:46:26] jimevans: sorry chromeOptions.binary
[15:47:17] lukeis: python sends {'platform': 'ANY', 'browserName': 'chrome', 'version': '', 'javascriptEnabled': True}
[15:47:38] SupplyCrawler: I put the chromedriver executable in a directory found in the PATH
[15:47:39] lukeis: Dude-X_: is correct
[15:47:42] SupplyCrawler: it's uh, not doin' much 
[15:47:55] lukeis: you need beta channel chrome installed
[15:48:12] lukeis: SupplyCrawler: you're using chromedriver or chromedriver2? from :chromedriver
[15:48:12] selbot2: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver | https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list 
[15:48:31] jimevans: okay, never mind me then.
[15:48:33] SupplyCrawler: chromedriver
[15:48:37] SupplyCrawler: the one released a couple months ago
[15:49:09] SupplyCrawler: 26.0.1383
[15:49:31] SupplyCrawler: I was using 26.0.1240, just trying to update to see if that solves my issues :V
[15:50:04] SupplyCrawler: when I try to execute the new chromedriver, though, nothing comes up
[15:50:10] SupplyCrawler: no port/version/log 
[15:50:27] lukeis: old one works just fine for me :)
[15:50:28] richkazin has joined #selenium
[15:50:32] lukeis: you have chrome installed right?
[15:50:35] SupplyCrawler: Lucky you. 
[15:50:37] SupplyCrawler: Yeah.
[15:50:44] SupplyCrawler: I've just had a lot of issues with the lack of timeout. Issue 9 
[15:51:14] SupplyCrawler: I doubt updating it's gonna help me, but it's worth a shot at this point. I've been running in circles trying to get this workin :P 
[15:51:19] lukeis: what happens if you start chromedriver directly (just run it) and connect to the remote driver at "http://localhost:9515"
[15:51:31] SupplyCrawler: nothing
[15:51:40] lukeis: i doubt nothing
[15:51:53] lukeis: you should get some kind of exception :)
[15:51:57] SupplyCrawler: -bash: ./chromedriver: No such file or directory 
[15:52:02] SupplyCrawler: It's in there.
[15:52:03] SupplyCrawler: trust me.
[15:52:17] lukeis: in your current working directory?
[15:52:31] lukeis: `ls chromedriver` shows it?
[15:52:36] SupplyCrawler: yeah
[15:53:08] lukeis: is it a binary file?
[15:53:12] SupplyCrawler: i mv'd the old chromedriver to chromedriver_old, and ./chromedriver_old has the port/version/log stuff come up

[15:55:08] SupplyCrawler: Can't md5

[16:24:06] jimevans: i've cobbled together a version of IEDriverServer.exe that does not rely on ATL. this means that it could theoretically be compiled using Visual C++ Express Edition (the free one).

[16:25:27] lukeis: if only to allow lukeis to compile / build his own IE driver to (potentially) add his own hacking contributions to.

[17:18:48] regex: jimevans: I done goofed when I was debugging.  I was messing with selectors.  I took the parent selector out and swapped it back in.  Both work ideally actually.  But obviously the main child element would be the only element needed.

[17:33:17] regex: jimevans: The driver erases the dom when a new browser window is opened.  Somehow on my test run when this new browser window opens it is not allowing this to work.

[17:34:50] Revery1 has joined #selenium
[17:35:03] dawagner: I'm just curious as to how relatively painful it is
[17:35:53] jimevans: regex: sorry. i don't know how i got it into my head you were working with IE.
[17:36:39] regex: jimevans: How dare you Jim. 
[17:36:57] *dawagner kills CI
[17:38:09] jimevans: dawagner: there are four big issues. first is the use of CComPtr, CComBSTR and CComVariant. these are replaceable with _com_ptr_t, _bstr_t, and _variant_t, respectively. however, the latter classes throw exceptions instead of just returning an HRESULT error code, so there's a fair amount of change around "what happens if this doesn't work and returns an error".
[17:38:32] Revery1 has joined #selenium
[17:39:01] jimevans: dawagner: the second issue is the use of the CA2W and CW2A string conversion macros. this is pretty easy to resolve, and i may make that change in the main code line anyway.
[17:40:56] jimevans: dawagner: the third issue is that we use IDispSimpleImpl to sink events from IE, and the fourth is that we use CWindowImpl to create a hidden window to send messages to for the actual execution. i lump these together because both involve the problem of how do we make an instance method of a C++ class a windows callback.
[17:42:03] jimevans: ATL solves that problem by using a "thunking" technique that involves changing the stack to point to the method. this is done with assembly code in the ATL libraries, which i've had to duplicate in the IEDriverServer.exe.
[17:42:21] jimevans: s/assembly code/hand-written assembly code/
[17:42:44] Revery1 has joined #selenium
[17:44:14] lukeis: hand-written assembly codeâ¦ heh, i haven't done that since college ;)
[17:44:57] lukeis: (and a couple months after when i helped my dad write his own OS boot loader)
[17:45:11] jimevans: i'm rather surprised i've gotten it working at all.
[17:46:15] zac_sel has joined #selenium
[17:46:41] jimevans: the changes kinda ugly up the code too, because i have to implement IDispatch in the classes i want to use to listen to events from IE. lots of boilerplate code that ATL nicely handles for you.
[17:47:44] regex: jimevans: Why ain't you got that showcased for the seleniumconf.  I gots to see you typing away behind a screen while you do this so that I can fix my own problems in the future.
[17:48:28] Revery1 has joined #selenium
[17:48:33] jimevans: oh, there's one other issue that i forgot to mention. the screenshot command handler uses the ATL CImage class to manipulate the screenshots, because it provides an easier way to get PNG image output. i've removed that limitation as well.
[17:49:18] jimevans: dawagner: so as you can see, it's a pretty extensive set of changes. not exactly a complete rewrite, but there's a great deal of churn there.
[17:50:53] lukeis: jimevans: did you push the change to your github repo or something?
[17:51:07] jimevans: no, it's in a local branch at the moment.
[17:51:21] jimevans: i've already squashed the commits.

[18:11:59] ryanpetr_ has joined #selenium

[18:20:59] Revery1 has joined #selenium
[18:22:06] jimevans: regex: aha. I thought so. your argument to .Window() is wrong. the .Window() method takes one of two things: either a window handle, which is a string assigned to it by webdriver; or the window's name, which is determined by the name argument in the javascript window.open() call that is made in your application's javascript source code.
