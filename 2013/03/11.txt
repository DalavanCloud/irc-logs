[00:59:13] selenium497: Hi! I have this Python string "Title\nBody\nFooter" and when I use it inside driver.execute_script() nothing happens. But if I remove \n, it works. How can I make it understand \n in string?
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Mar 11 01:03:45 2013]
[01:03:45] bperry: use \\n
[01:04:25] intchanter: selenium497: As bperry said, you'll have to quote the \ character.
[01:04:52] selenium497: Thanks a lot guys, just tried it and it works!
[01:10:30] intchanter: selenium497: Since you're passing it to another language that handles \ escapes, you can also use raw strings:
[01:10:42] intchanter: r'Title\nBody\nFooter'
[01:11:09] intchanter: That suppresses Python's interpretation of the escapes, leaving the string as you wrote it for Javascript to play with.

[01:16:51] selenium497: intchanter: thanks a lot for that one. i was just replacing all of the \n s in my code but this is gonna save me some time :)

[11:04:24] andreastt: barancev: So I've been looking at your proposal for adding namespaces.
[11:04:49] andreastt: barancev: Basically the idea is to take that list of namespaces and create a namespace resolver for document.evaluate() right?

[11:11:04] davehunt has joined #selenium
[11:11:58] samphippen has joined #selenium
[11:18:43] girija has joined #selenium
[11:27:43] barancev: andreastt: right
[11:30:27] barancev: andreastt: atm we have an over simplified default resolver {svg: 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'}
[11:31:39] barancev: and ability to build a custom resolver from document.documentElement if the list of namespaces is collected in the topmost element
[11:32:54] barancev: we can either scan the DOM and collect all namespaces automatically (is it ever possible? and what's preformance impact?)
[11:33:18] barancev: or allow a user to register namespaces via API
[11:39:27] freynaud has joined #selenium
[11:44:39] andreastt: Yes, that's exactly why I was asking actually.  Could we do it transparently somehow?
[11:45:33] andreastt: Unless I'm mistaken I don't think a listing of xmlns:CUSTOMNAMESPACE would be very expensive, but I might be wrong.
[11:45:49] andreastt: Sorry, I mean parsing the last part of xmlns' value.
[11:46:00] andreastt: Or possibly a combination of the both.
[11:46:32] andreastt: Yes, there would need to be an algorithm for saying first look for the last part of the value's path, then override witht he custom name space part of the tag.
[11:46:38] andreastt: s/tag/attribute/
[11:47:18] andreastt: barancev: I think I'll just go ahead and write a tentative reply to your email.
[11:47:48] andreastt: tl:dr; I'm not opposed of the idea of doing what you say, but my preference would a transparent solution.

[13:50:16] nirvdrum: llaskin: I'm close enough where I might be helpful.
[13:51:14] garndt: millenium: if it were me with this issue, I would monitor task manager while these tests ran and see if the process running the script or the IEDriverServer.exe process are taking up more CPU/memory each iteration.  You could also take the creation of the driver out of the test class constructor and move it into the for loop so a new one is created each
[13:51:14] garndt: iteration.
[13:51:55] garndt: to me when things start running slower each time they run, it points to something leaking
[13:51:57] garndt: but that's just my guess

[13:54:06] llaskin: i know about : ask
[13:55:37] barancev: llaskin: Eclipse, IDEA, NetBeans -- any one of these three is a good choice
[13:55:47] llaskin: ok
[13:55:52] llaskin: i was thinking Netbeans cuz $free
[13:56:01] garndt: I believe IDEA has a community version that is free
[13:56:04] barancev: all three are free
[13:56:27] barancev: IDEA Community edition is free
[13:56:55] nirvdrum: llaskin: IDEA is the way to go.
[13:57:14] barancev: llaskin: Eclipse is the way to go too :)
[13:57:41] nirvdrum: barancev: Are the Eclipse project files maintained nowadays?  For a while, they weren't.
[13:57:51] barancev: nirvdrum: they are
[13:58:34] nirvdrum: I'd still say IDEA just because that's a majority of what the committers use, so if you run into a problem, you're more likely to get help.
[13:59:31] barancev: yes, I'd say -- use whatever most people around you do
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Mar 11 14:00:03 2013]
[14:00:03] barancev: I use Eclipse, personally, I dislike IDEA
[14:01:20] barancev: (at the same time I use RubyMine for ruby, because it's the best ruby IDE, imho)
[14:03:02] teodosia_sel has left #selenium
[14:03:30] nirvdrum: barancev: I should give Eclipse another try.  Although I find the download process very confusing.
[14:03:40] nirvdrum: I never know what I should be looking for.
[14:04:21] adamgoucher: nirvdrum: its not just you … and thats a long standing soapbox :)
[14:04:50] nirvdrum: adamgoucher: I know.  In my case, I can't control what other people use, so I don't have much of a choice.
[14:05:14] nirvdrum: adamgoucher: Although I will say that it takes far longer than 3 hours to get an SSL cert signed.  The process is nutty.
[14:06:13] adamgoucher: nirvdrum: i suppose it depends on who you use, but yes, there is a lot of offline stuff to establish 'trust' (all of which is easily forge-able)

[14:34:38] supercom32: So this isn't really directly related to Selenium, but I figure someone here might know this. If I went "//div[@class='table'][2]", would that allow me to search the whole document for tables, and just return the 2nd instance it finds? I'm guessing it doesn't work that way.
[14:35:07] boob00: hi guys
[14:35:32] llaskin: yes supercom32 correct.
[14:35:42] llaskin: it does work that way
[14:36:28] supercom32: @llaskin: Thanks. I wonder why it's not picking that up then. Interesting.

[14:37:16] llaskin: supercom32: that should work AFAIK
[14:37:22] nirvdrum: supercom32: Well, that doesn't search for tables.  It searches for divs with the class of 'table'.
[14:38:02] llaskin: nirvdrum: good catch
[14:38:06] boob00: its http error 500... wnat me paste the exception?
[14:38:36] llaskin: paste exception, your code, and a snippet of the code you are testing against
[14:39:35] supercom32: @nirvdrum: Yep, I realize the mistake I made :-) 
[14:40:29] supercom32: @nirvdrum: Intresting bit, if I change my xpath to use [1] instead, it still returns 2 webElements. 
[14:41:37] supercom32: @nirvdrum: Not just the first instance of it.
[14:41:59] nirvdrum: supercom32: What API call are you using?
[14:42:20] supercom32: findElements. Nothing to fancy I thought.
[14:42:37] supercom32: For Selenium that is, of course.
[14:43:48] nirvdrum: supercom32: Well, yeah, that finds all elements that match that selector.  If you want just the first one, use findElement()
[14:43:49] fatguylaughing has joined #selenium
[14:45:10] supercom32: nirvdrum: Hrm... I thought the api would look for more than one element if it found one, but since I restricted it in my xPath, it would only return one element. Well at least in the case of me putting [2]. For [1] I can assume it would be like not putting an index at all, which would return all items.
[14:45:14] nirvdrum: supercom32: Or, root your selector at something other than the root of the document.
[14:45:59] supercom32: @nirvdrum: That's also a possible solution.
[14:46:27] nirvdrum: supercom32: I'm not an XPath expert, but I'm pretty sure if you have different ancestors, it'll keep searching. I.e., it searches for unique paths.
[14:46:58] nirvdrum: Ostensibly your found elements have different parents.
[14:47:25] supercom32: Right, that makes sense now that I think about it. (>_<)!

[15:47:21] llaskin: it can't interact with dialogs that are not part of the DOM
[15:47:28] florinv: barancev: yup, it works :)
[15:47:31] llaskin: so it can't work with the "Save File" or "Open File" dialog that windows pops up

[15:53:53] Phil37: it looks like an internal popup within the application
[15:54:03] Phil37: but when automated it looks like a windows modal dialog
[15:54:30] Phil37: looking for the JS that creates it
[15:55:51] barancev: so it's just a regular node, craft an appropriate locator for findElement and you win
[15:56:53] llaskin: what do you mean when automated it looks like a windows modal dialog?
[15:57:07] llaskin: can you find the dialog in the dom using Firebug?

[16:36:02] ssims: Hi All. In the ruby bindings, I want to insert a counter to store how many pages a test has loaded.  Is there an easy way to do this?
[16:36:32] ssims: I am already counting clicks and send_keys.   It has provided interesting data. 
[16:37:53] nirvdrum: ssims: I guess you could get the URL and if it's different, increment a count.
[16:38:31] ssims: I thought about that. But when would I check the url?  on what event?
[16:38:50] ssims: maybe every click
[16:39:02] nirvdrum: Most likely.
[16:39:19] nirvdrum: You could just write a wrapper that does it on every action.  Might be a bit slow though.
[16:39:30] ryanpetr_ has joined #selenium
[16:39:36] jimevans: ssims: true, but remember that clicks are asynchronous, so you might have a race condition there.
[16:40:03] nirvdrum: I have something like: safe_webdriver { driver.find_element(:xpath => 'blah' } for my tests to check for and handle pop-ups.

[18:45:29] garndt: anywhere that's in your path
[18:45:35] totic: I put it in C:/Windows/System32/ and it didnt work
[18:45:43] totic: (I am not a windows user) 
[18:45:52] garndt: I would refrain from putting anything into the Windows directory
[18:46:14] totic: garndt: I added it there for XP, win 7 and they both work
[18:47:21] garndt: I didn't say it wouldn't work, just saying I would refrain from it.  Why would you want to put things in the Windows directory or subdirectories that is not related to the actual windows installation? Either way, it doesn't matter to me, so... what's the error that you get when attempting to use it?
[18:47:53] garndt: does it just say that the file couldn't be found?
[18:48:39] plightbo_work has joined #selenium

[19:01:36] lukeis: totic: ok, then i'm not sure what is going on
[19:02:00] santiycr: barancev: I know jimevans was working on them for IE10
[19:02:13] santiycr: I haven't really been able to do anything from the sauce end yet
[19:02:21] barancev: santiycr: all browsers are failing, e.g. http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Firefox%2019%20XP%20Native%20Java%20Tests/
[19:02:37] barancev: ok, then dawagner should know
[19:02:47] santiycr: oh, that to me says code fail
[19:02:57] santiycr: on the atoms
[19:04:12] barancev: santiycr: all browsers on Windows platforms fail, Linux is OK
[19:04:14] jimevans: santiycr, barancev: my IE10 issues were related to the CI environment. can't repro the failures outside it, and suspect permissions issues for browser setup.
[19:05:10] jimevans: totic: what happens if you explicitly point your java code to the location of the IEDriverServer.exe (move it out of any of the Windows system folders first)?
[19:05:31] totic: I am using selenium grid, and python 
[19:05:57] totic: so far have it working with 19 different browsers
[19:06:00] totic: in 6 vms
[19:06:11] totic: WIN8 is the only annoying one right now
[19:06:20] jimevans: then what happens if you explicitly start your grid node pointing it to IEDriverServer in a folder not in a windows system folder?
[19:07:13] jimevans: i don't have a windows 8 environment at the moment, so i can't tell you whether IEDriverServer.exe will work when placed in the Windows directory or its subdirectories.
[19:07:34] jimevans: i can tell you that i would **STRONGLY** encourage you to get it out of the system folders.
[19:08:43] totic: jimevans: this is how I am starting it "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\java.exe" -jar C:\Users\federico\Downloads\selenium-server-standalone-2.31.0.jar  -role node -hub 
[19:08:43] totic: http://10.0.1.58:4444/grid/register -browser "browserName=internet explorer,version=10, platform=WINDOWS" -host 10.0.1.72
[19:08:45] jimevans: i say this because the trend from Microsoft has been to further and further restrict what's possible in the "special folders" of the windows operating system.
[19:09:08] totic: so how do I tell it where the driver is?
[19:09:14] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[19:09:24] totic: sorry I am a linux user, hadn't touched windows in 10 years
[19:10:10] jimevans: totic: what i'm suggesting is that you add a '-Dwebdriver.ie.driver="C:\Path\To\IEDriverServer.exe"' onto that command line.
[19:10:43] jimevans: this sets the 'webdriver.ie.driver' system property to the location of the IEDriverServer.exe. which is, incidentally, exactly what the exception tells you to do.
[19:11:22] totic: cool ill do that
[19:14:44] nirvdrum: jimevans: Is it possible to specify the path in the desired capabilities?
[19:15:11] jimevans: nirvdrum: no, and i'm not sure how that would work.
[19:15:18] jimevans: before you respond, listen to my logic.
[19:15:29] nirvdrum: Heh.
[19:16:38] totic: That seems to have fixed it
[19:16:46] totic: thanks
[19:16:53] jimevans: if you're running locally, you don't have a server that can understand desired capabilities until you start IEDriverServer.exe. if you're running remote using grid (or even just the raw remote java server), then the *server* needs to know the location; the client language bindings can't do anything about it.
[19:17:11] jimevans: nirvdrum: ^^
[19:17:18] jimevans: totic: np. glad to help.
[19:18:20] nirvdrum: jimevans: Well, if I as the client know the location (e.g., in a managed grid), couldn't that location just be appended to the PATH at process execution time?  It'd work basically the same way as the defaulte IEDriverServer lookup works right now.
[19:18:45] nirvdrum: If that's idiotic, feel free to yell at me.
[19:20:42] jimevans: nirvdrum: i don't necessarily think that's idiotic, but it seems to me to couple the client to the server (or "local end" to the "remote end", in the language of the W3C spec) in an unhealthy way. also seems like it would cause all kinds of complexity there.
[19:21:31] nirvdrum: jimevans: Well, in a grid set up it's valuable to have dumb nodes and smarter clients.
[19:21:36] jimevans: but i'm not a big "grid/remote server" guy (despite the fact that I have an independent remote implementation of my own)
[19:21:46] nirvdrum: Heh.
[19:22:35] lukeis: seems to me the node should know more about itself than the remote client.. *should*
[19:22:48] nirvdrum: jimevans: Really where the value for me would be is I could have two different IEDriver server versions installed and switch between them for a seemless upgrade without having to worry about Windows refusing me from overwriting the existing exe if it's in use.
[19:25:42] jimevans: that's an interesting use case i hadn't considered. i still think it might be more appropriate for the node to have a management api exposed so you could set that, but i'll admit i haven't thought the implications of that all the way through.
[19:26:38] detroniz_ has joined #selenium
[19:27:40] nirvdrum: jimevans: Yeah.  Right now if I want to upgrade a node, I basically have take it out of commission to guarantee the overwrite would happen.  And, if there turns out to be a problem, rolling back is harder than it should be because the old files are gone.
[19:28:02] nirvdrum: Whereas if I could version the binaries and switch via capabilities or whatever, things would get a lot simpler.
[19:30:40] riv_ has joined #selenium
[19:31:00] barancev: nirvdrum: a client has no information wchich node will serve a request to open a session
[19:31:22] barancev: how can a client manage nodes in a heterogeneous grid?
[19:31:50] barancev: we can introduce an "architecture" capability matcher
[19:37:06] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[19:37:08] nirvdrum: barancev: Well, assuming the nodes are homogenous.  A client can know whether to request IEDriverServer 2.31.0 or 2.32.3.  But I see your general point.
[19:37:35] nirvdrum: barancev: Keep in mind that a grid plugin can also add its own capabilities.  I've done this to manage proxy connections.
[19:37:54] nirvdrum: In this case, it's still coming from the client, but it's an prorammatic addition.
[19:38:08] barancev: I'd suggest to add more custom matchers
[19:38:27] nirvdrum: How do you mean?
[19:39:20] barancev: you set a custom capability e.g. "iedriver.version" and a capability matcher detects whether a node can serve such a request
[19:39:50] dhpe has joined #selenium
[19:40:37] barancev: but...
[19:40:39] nirvdrum: barancev: But that would require the node to re-register to update the hub with its capabilities.
[19:40:54] barancev: we have no ability to add a "custom session starter"
[19:41:08] nirvdrum: And it still wouldn't solve the problem of having multiple versions installed.  I'd have to manage the PATH somehow.
[19:41:48] barancev: yes, yes, a "session starter" custom servlet could tune the environment
[19:42:01] nirvdrum: The core issue is I'd like to point to a new IEDriverServer installation without having to shut the current node down.
[19:42:13] nirvdrum: Okay.
