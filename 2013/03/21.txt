[00:29:58] ojii: hi everyone, trying to write my first selenium test (in python +django) but with both firefox and chrome drivers, all selenium does is open new browser windows forever and nothing else
[00:30:13] ojii: i'm on 64bit linux with latest FF (stable) and latest Selenium
[00:31:14] llaskin: ojii are you following the examples on SeleniumHQ.org?
[00:31:25] ojii: llaskin, i'm following the examples on the django docs
[00:31:45] ojii: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/testing/overview/#django.test.LiveServerTestCase
[00:31:50] llaskin: i'm unsure of how to do it with django
[00:31:56] Revery has joined #selenium
[00:32:05] ojii: basically I'm doing WebDriver().get('someurl')
[00:32:12] ojii: and that just keeps opening new windows forever
[00:32:20] ojii: and it's not loading anything in those windows
[00:32:24] llaskin: i am unsure
[00:32:27] llaskin: thats a django question probably
[00:32:44] ojii: i'm pretty damn sure this is a selenium issue
[00:32:55] llaskin: we don't support django
[00:33:02] llaskin: so why you think that, I am unsure
[00:33:24] phishy has joined #selenium
[00:33:32] ojii: django is just python
[00:33:35] llaskin: right
[00:33:41] llaskin: but its not pure python
[00:33:47] ojii: well hardly anything is
[00:33:49] stephend: ojii: sorry, not sure how much this will help: https://github.com/peterbe/elmo/commit/3345ee7c27095d57f3c04e32e2b0097ab3eddff6
[00:34:06] stephend|mtg: but that's django + python + webdriver
[00:34:15] llaskin: http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp#introducing-the-selenium-webdriver-api-by-example  perhaps you can read this
[00:34:41] llaskin: and follow the python examples
[00:36:50] ojii: is it normal WebDriver() tries to open a browser window?
[00:37:09] llaskin: selenium does open a browser window, yes
[00:37:21] stephend|mtg: these are real-browser tests, yes
[00:37:34] stephend|mtg: in fact, that's one of the reasons my colleague (the dev, above) decided to hold off -- time
[00:37:44] ojii: i mean is that the time it's supposed to do it
[00:37:47] ojii: or at .get etc?
[00:38:05] llaskin: it opens at driver instantiation
[00:38:07] llaskin: prior to .get
[00:38:22] ojii: okay

[02:35:13] morteh: does anyone know of a way to set a delay between requests with webdriver python api?
[02:35:22] morteh: or do i need to insert lots of time.sleep()s ;(
[02:35:43] adamgoucher: what are you trying to achieve with the delay?
[02:35:43] stephend: a delay?
[02:35:54] stephend: morteh: why not wait for what you want?

[02:36:19] morteh: the forums spam filter is kicking in because im making so many posts so quick
[02:36:27] stephend: ah
[02:36:31] stephend: so you want an interval
[02:38:04] adamgoucher: or, assuming it is your forum, disable the spam filter for automation purposes
[02:38:35] morteh: how do i set an interval?
[02:38:39] stephend: (and it should at least be your company's)
[02:38:48] morteh: need to keep the forum standard for qualitay of experimentation

[02:44:29] plightbo: cool
[02:44:33] plightbo: I'll get to it this weekend
[02:45:03] adamgoucher: $client who needed it has a custom spun build so not too worried :)

[09:11:22] Revery has joined #selenium
[09:11:47] girija: b00b00, do lsof -i TCP:7054,  you will get pid, force kill that process
[09:15:09] b00b00: but i saw it working locally , when it behind a router i receive that error...

[09:35:25] b00b00: so no idea?
[09:35:50] b00b00: maybe selenium has a repoting bug that not resolving the right error to the real problem?
[09:36:47] Hronom has joined #selenium
[09:40:02] girija: b00b00, not sure so I far  encountered this on mac multiple times and was resolved with above steps, you may try very weird step  check if any updates are pending for FF

[10:03:59] Ravi: hi
[10:04:41] Guest86845: Hello. Need a help
[10:06:12] davehunt has joined #selenium
[10:07:00] Guest86845: I am trying to build selenium on linux project
[10:08:05] Guest86845: When trying to compile a file, say "server.cc" under cpp folder, I am getting error with json.h
[10:08:16] Guest86845: Kindly help me on this
[10:08:26] barancev|2: Guest86845: how do you build selenium?
[10:08:54] barancev|2: do you really want to recompile cc files? why can't you use prebuilt binaries?
[10:09:02] Guest86845: I tried building on my windows pc, by launching go.bat
[10:09:11] Guest86845: it perfectly built me all the libraries
[10:09:33] Guest86845: however, I wish to cross compile only the cpp implementation of web server
[10:09:57] Guest86845: so I tried to compile the files under cpp/webdriver-server/*.cc
[10:10:22] Guest86845: g++ -std=gnu++0x -I . -I ../webdriver-interactions/ -I /usr/include -I ../cpp/webdriver-firefox/ -I ../../third_party/json-cpp/ -I ../../third_party/json-cpp/include/ -I../../third_party/json-cpp/include/json/ -I ../../third_party/mongoose/ -c server.cc
[10:10:29] Guest86845: using a command similar to this
[10:10:42] barancev|2: ah, only cpp implementation of web server, sorry, no help, you probably have to ask eranm
[10:11:21] Guest86845: could you please guide me how to reach eranm?
[10:12:00] barancev|2: sometimes you can catch him here :)
[10:12:25] barancev|2: or send a message to selenium-developers group
[10:12:39] andreastt: barancev|2: Google Plus for example.
[10:12:43] andreastt: Or amil.
[10:12:44] andreastt: email.
[10:12:53] Guest86845: Can you please point me to any document that describes building selenium over linux?
[10:13:13] Guest86845: I can follow the instructions religiously and get it built. 
[10:13:20] barancev|2: source only, the build system is not documented
[10:14:03] Guest86845: omg
[10:14:22] Guest86845: Anyways, will try mailing the group you mentioned
[10:14:26] Guest86845: thanks a lot for the help
[10:14:53] barancev|2: only little bit :wiki BuildingWebDriver
[10:14:54] selbot2: 1: 03BuildingWebDriver: Instructions on how to build WebDriver - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/BuildingWebDriver
[10:16:12] Guest86845: But this is on windows right?
[10:16:26] zac_sel has joined #selenium
[10:16:26] Guest86845: this is not applicable for linux environment
[10:17:31] Guest86845: I mean the link points to build procedure on windows right?
[10:17:39] Guest86845: as we only have go.bat
[10:18:32] Guest86845: sorry it was a oversight
[10:18:43] Guest86845: I could see ./go usage on unix mentioned
[10:18:48] Guest86845: thanks for your support
[10:26:11] c0891 has joined #selenium
[10:26:35] c0891: is it possible to evaluate an ExpectedCondition witout using a WebDriverWait? i.e. I want to assert that the condition is true *now*
[10:27:07] c0891: (or another way to assert that an element is clickable without clicking it)
[10:28:00] barancev|2: what do you mean by "clickable"?
[10:28:08] Bebe_sel has joined #selenium
[10:28:24] c0891: dislayed, not hidden, not disabled...
[10:28:44] barancev|2: if (element.isDisplayed() && element.getAttribute("disabled") == null)
[10:29:10] c0891: yeah but I don't want to re-implement code that's already in ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable
[10:29:22] c0891: and I'm not sure if those are enough
[10:29:53] barancev|2: I'd remove this elementToBeClickable at all
[10:30:09] c0891: why?
[10:30:09] barancev|2: any element is "clickable" if it is displayed
[10:30:43] barancev|2: you can (as a human user) click a disabled element, why not?
[10:30:45] c0891: no. it can be displayed but some other element could be over it in which case most driver implementations will refuse to click
[10:31:03] barancev|2: most driver implementations == chromedriver only (atm)
[10:31:22] c0891: firefox started to behave the same way some weeks ago
[10:31:43] barancev|2: what? really? I missed this change?
[10:31:53] barancev|2: lemme look into the code
[10:32:10] c0891: not sure about code changes but I'm pretty sure I've seen some of our tests fail in firefox
[10:32:53] c0891: you're right about "being able to click it as a human" though but I'd rather see that condition renamed than removed
[10:33:40] barancev|2: ok
[10:33:43] c0891: boolean clickable = ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.id("foo")).apply(driver)
[10:34:05] c0891: this should do it I guess :)
[10:34:06] barancev|2: yes, exactly, this way
[10:34:20] barancev|2: that's quite ugly, imho
[10:34:55] c0891: yes, but it's better than what you proposed because it has meaning ("clickable") without needing an explanatory comment
[10:35:15] c0891: of course element.isClickable() would be better to read
[10:35:16] barancev|2: it's "non-standard" meaning
[10:35:26] barancev|2: there is no such term
[10:35:42] barancev|2: any element is clickable if it is displayed
[10:35:59] barancev|2: if it is hidden behind another element -- it's not displayed
[10:36:28] barancev|2: if it is partially hidden -- it's hmmm... partially displayed and partially clickable :)
[10:36:51] barancev|2: you can click at the element, thought not in the center of the element
[10:37:29] c0891: does webdriver click the center anyway? or the upper left?
[10:37:46] barancev|2: by default it clicks in the center
[10:38:15] c0891: okay… the partially cases is interesting btw… from a test perspective one would usually assert that the element is displayed as a whole, right?
[10:38:42] c0891: if only 2x10 pixels of my button are displayed I'd like a test to fail
[10:39:11] c0891: isDisplayedEnough() (kidding)

[15:05:09] barancev|2: is element.isEnabled() equivalent to element.getAttribute("disabled") == null ?
[15:05:44] lukeis: for the most part i believe that is true
[15:05:45] Revery has joined #selenium

[15:07:49] rbalent has joined #selenium
[15:08:06] barancev|2: atom docs: "An element is considered enabled if it does not support the "disabled" attribute, or if it is not disabled"
[15:08:57] barancev|2: and there is a special case: "The element is not explicitly disabled, but if it is an OPTION or OPTGROUP, we must test if it inherits its state from a parent" -- why the browser does not inherit the property?
