[00:57:40] Applejack_: Hey there guys. I'm having session issues with grid2 and my Amazon EC2 machines.  I can connect the windows server 2008 node to the ubuntu hub just fine. When I run my script from my dev box, the node only runs the first line to start firefox.  This is what it looks like in command prompt up to when it runs the first line and stops:  00:33:45.220 INFO - Done: /status 00:33:50.227 INFO - Executing: org.openqa.selenium.remote.serv

[03:30:09] rigel: hi, so i am trying to set up webdriver on a fresh debian vm
[03:30:35] rigel: and i am pretty clueless with all the terminology. is it enough to install the python bindings and selenium-rc
[03:30:58] rigel: or er, scuse me, not selenoum-rc but selenium-ide
[03:31:11] rigel: or do i need to be running the java program too
[03:31:39] rigel: i will only be using one browser instance on one machine
[03:49:03] codepython777 has joined #selenium
[03:49:21] codepython777: In python, for the current release of selenium bindings, seems like : driver = webdriver.Firefox() hangs

[03:49:43] codepython777: Is this the correct up2date docs: http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started.html ?

[05:07:28] codepython7771: Hi Manoj_
[05:07:43] codepython7771: do you know whats wrong with ff19 and selenium webdriver?
[05:10:37] Manoj_: well, there is nothing wrond that I find.
[05:10:45] Manoj_: What's up ? with you ?
[05:11:07] codepython7771: driver.Firefox() hangs
[05:11:28] codepython7771: Manoj_: driver = webdriver.Firefox()
[05:11:50] Manoj_: what version do you use ? 2.x ?
[05:12:06] codepython7771: python 2.7.3, selenium latest, firefox 19
[05:12:29] Manoj_: :changelog
[05:12:30] selbot2: .NET: http://goo.gl/zBIjE | Java: http://goo.gl/5B23U | Ruby: http://goo.gl/yN6Qm | Python: http://goo.gl/7BtCb | IDE: http://goo.gl/50vLB
[05:13:28] Manoj_: do you have a stack trace of the error ?
[05:13:53] Manoj_: it shouldn't cause any error's like that. ff19 is supported with native events for python 2.7.3
[05:14:02] codepython7771: lemme show you
[05:14:09] Manoj_: sorry 2.31
[05:15:11] codepython7771: http://bpaste.net/show/mHVhx4EUuiWilcedo7BE/
[05:18:30] Manoj_: i think that is searches for te firefox binary in your system... and gets hanged for a while..
[05:23:05] codepython7771: its running firefox right away
[05:23:17] codepython7771: Manoj_: just shows a white blank screen, till i press Ctrl+C
[05:23:24] Manoj_: you mean its fine now ?
[05:24:05] codepython7771: no
[05:24:17] codepython7771: when i run webdriver.Firefox() -- it fires firefox, and then it hangs
[05:24:26] codepython7771: which means it does find the binary, but something else is wrong
[05:24:30] Manoj_: ok, so have you give the lod url ?
[05:24:31] Manoj_: yes
[05:24:35] Manoj_: you are right.

[05:32:48] Manoj_: sure welcome.
[05:33:08] Manoj_: try this sample program in the documentation http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/py/index.html
[05:33:40] Manoj_: then if you face any difficulties, share the tract trace, ppl are here to help.
[05:33:46] Manoj_: thanks for trying, Selenium :)
[05:34:04] Manoj_: *stack trace
[05:47:41] codepython7771: Manoj_AFK: the first example on that link does not work anymore on windows + ff19 + selenium latest.

[06:45:31] Manoj_: just thinking to doc the webdriver architecture.
[06:45:50] Manoj_: we have in plce for the Selenium RC but not for the webdriver.
[06:46:25] Manoj_: is there anythign that I can consider to document that, other than the http://www.aosabook.org/en/selenium.html
[06:47:53] barancev: no, this is the only writing I know
[06:48:17] barancev: and I'd just put a link to this excellent article
[06:48:24] Manoj_: yeah, 
[06:49:01] Manoj_: My idea is to extract all those driver specific architecture details and diagrams here in selenium doc with a title called WebDriver architecture
[06:49:22] Manoj_: something like, driver specifc trade off - which we already have in place.
[06:49:55] Manoj_: Excellent Idea !!! ;)

[08:19:10] nullx: hi
[08:19:59] One-Man-Bucket: hello
[08:20:53] nullx: so I'm wondering.. has anyone heard of any kind of testing that could tell me per se.. how many active tabs I could have in a browser while them still being responsive lol
[08:21:03] nullx: I'm kind of looking at this problem shortly, just wondering if anyone kmnows any articles etc
[08:21:20] nullx: I do assume it relies on other things (ram, hard drive vs ssd, cpu, etc..)
[08:23:10] Ardesco has joined #selenium
[08:23:47] ShawnM: if you had the tabs doing controlled things, then amped it up while having assertions against how long your threshold for responsive is in loops until they are exceeded
[08:23:57] ShawnM: could derive that data your looking for perhaps
[08:24:01] Ardesco has joined #selenium
[08:24:16] nullx: well in my case, it might be small actions (like submitting forms), but could just be getting source/screenshot
[08:27:51] nullx: yeah
[08:27:56] nullx: anyway I guess I'll have to test myself
[08:28:08] ShawnM: set timers on page load completions  or ajax requests or whatever and ramp up until your requests are taking to long and have it fail assertions
[08:28:37] nullx: ShawnM: I hadn't thought that far, but I appreciate the suggestion, that is smart.
[08:29:03] nullx: could just re-do and re-do same actions etc
[08:29:57] Hronom has joined #selenium
[08:30:30] ShawnM: it may be dependent on the ability to do concurrent requests in multiple tabs of the same browser though
[08:35:13] nullx: well I'm going to use chrome because the way it's supposedly set up, a tab is the same as a new window
[08:35:43] stan has joined #selenium
[08:36:25] nullx: anyhow this is just planning before I go and actually code up this project
[08:36:36] nullx: but not something I can't test very easily right now, it's not a whole lot of coding

[09:03:31] duke__ has joined #selenium
[09:03:58] duke__: hey guys
[09:06:56] duke__: is there a defined way of adding a module or something to the selenium hub ?
[09:07:02] duke__: is there a modular concept atm at all ?
[09:21:41] samphippen has joined #selenium
[09:24:33] bogus_ has joined #selenium
[09:35:53] barancev: duke__: what do you mean by a module?
[09:36:02] Bebe_sel has joined #selenium
[09:36:07] duke__: i for example want to authenticate users
[09:36:15] duke__: so i would think of an authenticating module
[09:36:32] duke__: or i would keep commands in a loop
[09:36:36] duke__: when there is no machine ready
[09:36:42] duke__: instead of throwing an exception ...
[09:38:51] nullx: duke__: well you can always have some way of checking if there is a machine ready, by setting machineReady = true; inside a try, then inside catch(Exception) { you can put machineReady = false; }
[09:39:06] nullx: though
[09:39:09] duke__: i kinda doing that right now
[09:39:12] nullx: oh I see
[09:39:14] duke__: but like the authentifcation
[09:39:18] nullx: fair enough
[09:39:21] duke__: is see some things
[09:39:25] duke__: you could realize as module
[09:39:32] duke__: e.g. i really disklike the webinterface
[09:39:34] nullx: I totally agree though
[09:39:38] duke__: there could be a lot improvement
[09:39:45] duke__: i don't think the core has to be changed for that
[09:39:47] nullx: like if someone has access to your lan, is aware of it being ran on an ip on a standard port
[09:39:52] nullx: they could mess with you
[09:39:53] duke__: but i would like a modular option to extend it
[09:40:08] nullx: ...but if there was an authentication process, then they wouldn't have access to
[09:40:09] duke__: I more have the problem of different stake holders
[09:40:16] duke__: who might use the system
[09:40:17] nullx: k
[09:40:21] duke__: and i want to identify them
[09:40:24] duke__: when they use the system
[09:40:28] nullx: ah gotcha
[09:40:36] nullx: so you can measure stuff that way
[09:40:38] nullx: I presume
[09:40:53] duke__: system usage and if they are still allowed to use a specific grid
[09:40:58] duke__: i have 1200 machine configurations
[09:41:08] duke__: and not every grid configuration has all of them
[09:42:33] nullx: makes sense

[09:52:06] barancev: duke__: there is (a bit outdated) tutorial how to extent the grid: https://github.com/freynaud/grid-plugin-tutorial/wiki/Tutorial
[09:54:57] barancev: duke__: and a presentation from SeConf: http://www.slideshare.net/seleniumconf/introduction-to-seleniumgridworkshop
[09:56:00] nullx: I don't like grid because I find the speed at which you get any information that isn't native to the same pc is horrendous in comparison to software running on the same pc
[09:56:00] barancev: I'm not sure about authentication and authorization... who and when should send credentials?
[09:56:34] barancev: nullx: you're ok unless you have to run lots of tests in many envs
[09:57:03] bogus_ has joined #selenium
[09:57:03] nullx: barancev: the solution to that for me is simple, just have your software on each env =/
[09:57:04] barancev: e.g. selenium regression test set is about 750 test methods and we run them in about 35 various environments
[09:57:09] nullx: yeah
[09:57:14] birnig01 has joined #selenium
[09:57:53] nullx: I can totally understand that
[09:57:56] barancev: and with grid you no need to deploy tests to all the configs (deployment infrastructire is too easy to build too, ya?)
[09:57:56] nullx: the bigger the more difficult a problem it is
[09:58:21] barancev: and sometimes you phisically can't deploy, e.g. to mobile platfors
[09:58:42] nullx: on another note, I just threaded my test benchmark and it's eating up b/w like the cookie monster
[09:58:58] barancev: yes, a hundred tests to run once a day in the latest Firefox -- no need to grid )
[09:59:51] nullx: overall its making it take a lot longer surprisingly
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Mar  1 10:00:03 2013]
[10:00:03] nullx: actually, nevermind
[10:00:23] nullx: well
[10:00:30] nullx: it took roughly 50 seconds and did 5 at once, instead of 16-20
[10:01:27] nullx: saved time, but it was laggy for my pc box (which has 64 gigs of ram and a very hefty cpu)
[10:01:44] barancev: we run about 750 tests in about 35 envs after each commit and it takes ~15 min to obtain feedback after commit, for all browser/OS combinations we are interested in
[10:02:00] nullx: yup
[10:02:05] barancev: :ci
[10:02:06] selbot2: Jenkins: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/ | Dashboard: http://dashboard.ci.seleniumhq.org/
[10:02:22] nullx: I'm setting up a system to get all my tests done in a flash, but it's not like this is a 2 second thing
[10:02:23] barancev: it's all open, look at it :)
[10:02:33] nullx: I've seen it before, I thought it was very cool
[10:03:03] nullx: I have a lot of experience with jenkins.. and before that hudson heh
[10:03:12] nullx: but it's awesome seeing a full production setup
[10:05:27] nullx: the worst killer for selenium seems to be browser startup time though
[10:06:35] barancev: yes, and the grid attempts to reuse browsers
[10:07:47] barancev: it puts started browsers to the pool and future tests don't spend time to start the browser
[10:07:52] nullx: cool
[10:08:02] nullx: I didn't know that.. when I used grid it didn't do that
[10:08:12] duke__: barancev: thx good be an entry point
[10:08:19] duke__: my main goal is
[10:08:23] duke__: when i extend the hub somehow
[10:08:31] duke__: that it will still be compatible with the main development branch
[10:08:35] nullx: duke__: maybe you just wanna tag who is using it?
[10:08:40] nullx: rather than authentication
[10:08:41] nullx: like
[10:09:09] nullx: connect up, run a command called 'ranBy' which accepts a single string, the name
[10:09:12] duke__: i really want to controll which person uses which grid
[10:09:13] nullx: or a tag even
[10:09:15] nullx: oh I see
[10:09:17] nullx: alright
[10:09:22] nullx: I didn't catch that part
[10:09:30] duke__: otherwise somebody might use it without approval
[10:09:36] nullx: k
[10:09:57] duke__: i have seen saucelabs examples
[10:09:59] barancev: yes, it's posible. all the cloud grid services use authentication (by unique api key usually)
[10:10:04] duke__: they simpley use the user:pw@host:port
[10:10:10] duke__: i am not shure whether apach or something
[10:10:20] duke__: does authentifcation before forwarding it
[10:10:22] duke__: to the hub
[10:10:25] duke__: or how they implemented it
[10:10:28] nullx: k
[10:10:40] barancev: ask santiycr when it's here
[10:10:54] barancev: when he's here
[10:11:07] duke__: i will
[10:11:18] duke__: have to take a look into the hub code my self when i have time
[10:11:24] duke__: i think it would also be great 
[10:11:57] Phil37: when grid reuses the browser does it resuse the same driver?  maybe a stupid question
[10:12:11] duke__: to enable the opportunity to modify the hub web frontend e.g.

[11:40:21] Manoj_: right, making a spot test on locators or a test to automate a scenario might do well :)
[11:41:08] Ardesco: more than that Manoj_ basically chuck them in front of an IDE and give them a page and tell them to automate it
[11:41:33] Ardesco: e.g. right i want you to automate login and then validate we are on the correct page once logged in

[12:10:42] Mox[NL]: hey, anyone tips on testing 'unhover'? I move to the element using action move_to which displays the (hover) tooltip, but how to I test moving away from the item making the tooltip disappear? Moving to another element does not trigger the 'onmouseout'
[12:14:27] dhpe: Hi. An implementation-detail question about session IDs in Selenium 2.31.0: When a new session is created, selenium server redirects to a session id like 800000000000000000000000000000000023. Interestingly the following (GetCapabilities) query returns a sessionId like a2d1c745-6647-4625-a33f-13c0639cc278 in the JSON response. What is the relationship of these IDs?
[12:17:19] dhpe: barancev: you've been apparently working on renewing session ids to prevent duplication. can you comment?
[12:18:41] barancev: dhpe: I did not understand this part: "selenium server redirects to a session id like 800000000000000000000000000000000023"
[12:21:39] dhpe: yes, on webdriver protocol: there's: POST /wd/hub/session to create a new session (hub calls selenium node). This should return HTTP 302 redirect to the new session. And it does: but I get a http redirect to /wd/hub/session/800000000000000000000000000000000023
[12:21:54] dhpe: and the following query to this session, returns a different kind of sessionId the the JSON payload.
[12:22:38] dhpe: In 2.25.0 these IDs used to be the same. So that is confusing me.
[12:22:55] Ardesco: moo-_-: which language bindings?  It works ok with Java
[12:23:04] Ardesco: Mox[NL]: even
[12:23:57] barancev: dhpe: it should be the same session ID as returned in JSON responce
[12:24:16] barancev: yes, same question -- which language binding?
[12:24:21] papegaaij_ has joined #selenium
[12:25:02] barancev: or, may be you're talking about grid?
[12:25:29] barancev: there are two kinds of sessions there -- "external" and "internal"
[12:26:22] barancev: I'm busy a bit atm to dive into code, sorry
[12:26:56] barancev: let's an easy question: what's the issue? what misbehaviour do you see?
[12:28:06] dhpe: okay, i'll investigate further myself. thanks.
[12:28:26] dhpe: (to be able to be more precise)
[12:40:07] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[12:49:14] dhpe: barancev: yeah the problem was two-fold: the redirect to the session has been fixed to return HTTP 303 (as in spec), which my component did not consider yet, and then the change in the ID format from integer to UUID format caused to unexpected behavior. so everything is fine. thanks for comments.
[12:49:51] barancev: dhpe: are you a language binding developer?
[12:53:18] cheezy has joined #selenium
[12:53:21] barancev: yes, we brought the return code to the specification
[12:53:52] barancev: as for the session id, it always been a sting (albeit looking like a number :))
[12:55:57] dhpe: barancev: im customizing the python bindings and the hub.
[12:56:10] dhpe: so i'm working directly on webdriver protocol
[12:59:06] dhpe: btw, great that you fixed the ID uniqueness problem.

[17:19:13] lukeis: ios-driver it works mostly, i've encountered some edge cases (but if they're on ios-driver 0.5 there's likely issues)

[17:26:38] jimevans: arex\: remember that every time webdriver launches firefox, it has to do a truckload of stuff with respect to creating the anonymous profile used by the driver.
[17:26:40] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[17:27:20] jleyba: ^ that's a very good point.
[17:27:51] jleyba: Chrome just needs to create an empty directory and away it goes. For Firefox we need to create a dir, copy the extension over, launch FF to register the extension, then launch it again so you can actually use it
[17:28:01] arex\: jimevans: That makes sense I guess. Does other browsers do the same? Does it mean I should try to reuse the browser window? (ie not start a new browser for each test?)
[17:28:48] jleyba: arex\: That's really up to you.  Re-using the browser will certainly be faster, but your tests won't be hermetic (they'll share browser cookies, cache, history, web storage, etc)
[17:29:02] jimevans: arex\: chrome doesn't do much in the way of profile creation; IE doesn't support profiles at all.
[17:30:29] arex\: jleyba, jimevans, thanks a lot :)

[18:21:28] lukeis: check the source? :)
[18:21:52] arex\: ah, yes
[18:22:03] arex\: found it :)
[18:22:47] arex\: wondering if my hub configuration contributes to the fact that it takes 10-40 seconds for the node to recieve the first command
[18:23:03] arex\: (or the node configuration)
[18:23:52] lukeis: that sounds very very strange, i can't think of anything that would cause a delay in the commands… browser startup on the other hand can often take that long
[18:24:15] arex\: it is a long delay until i see that the node recieves the first command
[18:24:22] arex\: i also find it weird
[18:24:39] arex\: it seems to vary a lot so i thought polling may have been involved
[18:24:45] lukeis: before you see the first /session  request? or before the first get goes through?
[18:24:55] arex\: before i see anything in the node console

[19:44:06] regex__: jimevans_: hey
[19:44:20] jimevans_: regex__: s'up
[19:44:34] regex__: jimevans_: I have a question.  I am considering building a nearest neighbor algorithm to predict all elements that need validation in Selenium. 
[19:44:59] jimevans: okay. i have a sneaking suspicion that you're going to find that challenging.
[19:45:02] jimevans: but be my guest.
[19:45:16] regex__: jimevans: Why?
[19:45:43] regex__: jimevans: Challenging for me in general?  Or challenging for anyone in general?
[19:46:55] jimevans: because you'll need to take things into account like parent-child-sibling relationships; visibility of parent, child, and sibling nodes (both up and down the DOM tree); the possibility of elements dynamically added to or removed from the DOM; and so on.
[19:47:09] jimevans: not to mention you need to define "near"
[19:48:02] lukeis: 'visibly near' should be easy enough o.0   ;)
[19:48:13] jimevans: on top of that, i'm not sure i see the use case for such a construct. i firmly believe that if you're writing a test, you should *know* what you're testing.
[19:48:35] jimevans: leave the guesswork for manual, exploratory sessions.
[19:49:00] regex__: jimevans: Just create a maximum distance.  Just a nearest neighbor algorithm.  
[19:49:02] jimevans: but, as i often say, i'm an idiot about this stuff, so don't listen to me. knock yourself out.

[19:50:38] *lukeis thinks many people are idiots…
[19:51:47] regex__: jimevans: The interface for Selenium though.  If I developed a method to say "Verify all Divs, verify all Titles, verify all headers, or footers".  Work on a simple use case first and build. 
[19:52:54] jimevans: regex__: i'm sorry, i'm not entirely following. you'll have to excuse me, i've had a headache for the last three days, and i'm having a little trouble concentrating.
[19:53:12] regex__: jimevans: lukeis It should maybe just predict elements erlative to another.  If you type in your title, it should recommend other title tags on the page and say "should I veirfy this title tag with this text" 
[19:54:15] jimevans: you'll need to give me a bigger picture. i'm hearing you say "if you type in…" i don't understand that from the point of view of webdriver code.
[19:54:42] jimevans: if you're creating an application that uses webdriver that has a UI that you expect other people to use, that's fine, but you've not said that.
[19:55:15] AutomatedTester: lukeis: I think many people are idiots too
[19:55:22] AutomatedTester: myself included in list of idiots
[19:55:38] *lukeis is often the biggest of them too

[19:55:57] AutomatedTester: right...
[19:56:18] AutomatedTester: I had an epiphany about a bug, lets create a test case
[19:56:51] jimevans: i hate the .NEt page factory.
[19:56:55] AutomatedTester: Come one, come all, bring your visibility bugs
[19:57:14] AutomatedTester: bring your CSS Transforms, overflows and absolute positioning
[19:57:33] regex__: jimevans: lukeis AutomatedTester Create a simple web app using Jquery (Jim's going to hate that) that has a box and says "What do you want to verify".  The user types in "title tag".  And then it predicts which tags to test, populates them to the user, and a button to test. 
[19:58:05] regex__: jimevans: You haven't added me on LinkedIn yet by the way, Jim. 
[19:58:08] lukeis: i would qualify that as non-deterministic testing
[19:58:36] jimevans: regex__: i didn't know i was supposed to. :)

[20:55:49] intchanter-work: I'm with a web hosting company and we're trying to implement real release management for the web services that support our hosting products.
[20:56:19] lukeis: we build everything in Jenkins, and depending on what you want to do, you can have Jenkins auto-deploy stuff too
[20:56:20] Ardesco_H: we are all set up for continuous delivery, every push is tested in all browser and an RPM is generated that can be pushed out to the prod servers via puppet
[20:56:23] Ardesco_H: but
[20:56:33] Ardesco_H: the business doesn't belive in continuos delivery
[20:56:33] intchanter-work: We're hoping to do that along with migrating away from $ANCIENT_VCS.
[20:56:41] Ardesco_H: so we get as far as generating an RPM

[20:57:58] intchanter-work: Maximum Viscosity Plan?  :-p
[20:58:15] Ardesco_H: something like that
[20:58:25] Ardesco_H: we did MVP with IE8 support being out of scope
[20:58:33] Ardesco_H: then they told us we can't release without IE8 support
[20:58:38] *Ardesco_H facepalm's

[20:59:04] intchanter-work: Ouch.

[21:23:23] lukeis: since the constructor doesn't take the desired capabilities
[21:24:07] Osleg: well i modified the constructor to take des_caps and to pass it further
[21:24:40] AutomatedTester: garndt: http://rd.io/x/QUNOECJRAZc
[21:24:47] lukeis: ok, only problem with modifying the source is upgrading will start to be a pain to move forward your patches
[21:24:49] Osleg: so if i see in <ieInstance>.desire_capabilities['nativeEvents'] is false then it should work?
[21:25:12] Osleg: lukeis: yeah, but i just trying and playing for now
[21:25:17] *AutomatedTester will add it now quickly
[21:25:42] Osleg: oh and much more then pug bot :) few other plugins too, but they are not on github :D
