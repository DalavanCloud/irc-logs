[16:13:12] ayia: Hi Guys, 
[16:13:49] ayia: driver.manage(), driver.navigate(), etc looks pretty nice for me... Is this any known design pattern?
[16:17:14] jarib: not sure if it qualifies as a "fluent interface"
[16:17:39] jarib: but that's what i'd call it (as a non-java person)
[16:20:26] ayia: jarib: thanks)
[16:21:34] ayia: btw, is there any other irc channels about testing/qa automation in general?

[19:05:37] PeterGriffin: hello everyone
[19:06:09] PeterGriffin: have a question, i see PHP RC is no longer supported... what would be the downside if i kept using it ?
[19:08:58] DarkRift: no bug fix ...
[19:09:30] DarkRift: no new features
[19:10:09] stephend has joined #selenium
[19:10:34] DarkRift: possibility of not being compatible after some times too if they change inners or major internal refactoring (if that would ever happen)
[19:10:42] ShawnM has joined #selenium
[19:11:47] DarkRift: PeterGriffinL those are the ones I can think straight away from the top of my head ...
[19:25:02] barancev: PeterGriffin: not only PHP binding is no longer supported, RC as the whole is deprecated
[19:28:31] PeterGriffin: what should i do ?
[19:28:37] PeterGriffin: im used to the old selenium =/
[19:31:45] barancev: if you need to support a legacy test test suite that works successfully -- just do it
[19:32:01] barancev: if you develop new tests -- use WebDriver API
