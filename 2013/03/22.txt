[10:43:52] d0x: :)
[10:44:27] andreastt: I still can't get to be friends with the autoclose features in the new try-block-finally blocks.
[10:44:39] andreastt: What is it you've been working on?
[10:44:56] simonstewart: migrating from java 6 to 7
[10:45:00] simonstewart: It should be easy
[10:45:06] simonstewart: But imagine a large code base
[10:50:20] d0x: I put my question also on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15568599/firefoxdriver-webdriver-doesnt-start-with-selenium-2-31-0
[10:50:45] d0x: If i would be able to reproduce it, i would also file a bug
[10:50:52] d0x: But it's random :(
[10:51:24] simonstewart: Do you ever get a warning about "safe mode" for firefox?>
[10:52:47] AutomatedTester: oh hai simonstewart

[10:53:41] Phil37 has joined #selenium
[10:55:31] d0x: was the "safe mode" related to my question? nope :(
[10:55:55] simonstewart: d0x: yup. If you hold down the shift key at just the wrong spot, firefox starts with extensions disabled
[10:56:05] simonstewart: Ever see anything in the error console of firefox?

[11:04:46] jibay has joined #selenium
[11:06:49] d0x: simonstewart: i tried to reproduce it the shift key, but it wasn't reproducable
[11:07:52] simonstewart: The next step would be to look at the error console in firefox
[11:08:14] d0x: but firefox doesn't start. How to look at it?
[11:08:16] simonstewart: Can't remember the magic, but you can get firefox to log to a file (including all the webdriver internal logging)
[11:08:32] simonstewart: It doesn't start _always_ or only sometimes? I thought it was periodic
[11:08:44] d0x: it doesn't start sometimes
[11:08:53] d0x: if it starts, everything is fine
[11:08:57] d0x: then i close it
[11:09:00] d0x: start it again
[11:09:07] d0x: and there it fails
[11:09:45] simonstewart: Ah. That's interesting
[11:09:53] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: seen anything like that? ^^
[11:10:11] AutomatedTester: nope
[11:10:24] AutomatedTester: d0x: when it fails does the browser start?
[11:11:26] Ardesc0_H has joined #selenium
[11:11:27] d0x: nope, i don't "see" the browser. But i forget to check whether the is firefox process running
[11:12:11] d0x: on the stacktrace i see that it got stucked in the while(!hasResult) loop in DefaultExecuteResultHandler
[11:12:34] d0x: *there is a firefox proccess
[11:14:38] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: no, need to do trusted events on FirefoxOS

[11:16:25] AutomatedTester: nsCOMPtr<nsIWidget> kungFuDeathGrip = this; <- found this gem in the Firefox code base
[11:18:18] liberus has joined #selenium

[11:28:35] d0x: I'm currently in the debugging mode and i see the programm is loops in the while(!hasResult()). 
[11:28:59] d0x: And there are 6 Firefox PIDs
[11:29:13] d0x: 3 "firefox" and 3 "firefox <defunct>"
[11:30:03] d0x: Can i maybe get some usefull information for you out of the "/tmp/anonymous2897228334191457861webdriver-profile"
[11:32:15] d0x: maybe this is interesting: lrwxrwxrwx 1 christian christian   15 Mar 22 12:31 lock -> 127.0.1.1:+6008

[11:55:32] AutomatedTester: *sigh* I really really hate that there isnt a standard for naming files if they are interfaces or not
[11:56:27] simonstewart: Eh? It doesn't matter
[11:56:42] AutomatedTester: it does when you are looking through code on your disk
[11:56:43] simonstewart: What matters is the role the "thing" plays in the system

[11:57:05] simonstewart: I've not had that problem in years
[11:57:10] *AutomatedTester opens file, oh look its an interface and not what I wanted
[11:57:33] simonstewart: Mind you, I'm in Java most of the time and the IDEs are bloody good
[11:57:39] simonstewart: (though I had the same thing in .Net)
[11:57:54] simonstewart: (and it's not really a problem in JS ime)
[11:57:56] AutomatedTester: same thing in .nET?
[11:57:59] AutomatedTester: .NET?
[11:58:00] simonstewart: Sure
[11:58:04] AutomatedTester: really?
[11:58:11] simonstewart: One word: resharper
[11:58:15] AutomatedTester: if it has an I in the front its an interface
[11:58:21] simonstewart: but even VS can jump to definitions

[IRC logfile - Started Fri Mar 22 12:00:05 2013]
[12:00:05] simonstewart: It's about providing type information in the name of the thing
[12:00:11] d0x: The DefaultExecuteResultHandler.onProcessComplete or DefaultExecuteResultHandler.onProcessFailed isn't called
[12:00:31] Ardesco: strMyQuestion= "why what's wrong with it?" 
[12:00:41] AutomatedTester: d0x: can you update https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/firefox/FirefoxDriver.java#240 to have 127.0.0.1
[12:00:55] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: and thats the wrong use

[12:03:30] Fyre has joined #selenium
[12:03:47] d0x: AutomatedTester: ok, i have the code local because i download it with maven. But i will clone it now it try it
[12:04:04] girija has joined #selenium
[12:04:59] Ardesco: so what's the right use, I thought is was just stating the type of your variables
[12:05:51] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: its more describing your variable
[12:06:28] Ardesco: i thought that was just good practice in general
[12:06:36] d0x: Wow... to clone the repo takes a long time....
[12:06:37] AutomatedTester: so if you are doing calculations on a point, this is just a basic example, then you are supposed to do plainXPoint
[12:06:41] Ardesco: suppose it depends how you define describe though
[12:06:56] AutomatedTester: d0x: yea, thats what we get for people being swivel eyed over git
[12:07:20] barancev: AutomatedTester: what's wrong with 'localhost' ?
[12:07:42] AutomatedTester: barancev: read the scroll back
[12:08:16] barancev: aha, localhost aliased to 127.0.1.1, interesting
[12:08:54] p_l: basically, you should use "localhost", not the ip address
[12:09:05] p_l: because 127.0.0.1 is just the *default* loopback ;P
[12:09:46] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: read http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa260976%28VS.60%29.aspx
[12:10:47] *Ardesco has a look\
[12:10:49] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: the strX intX is how people have interpreted ^
[12:11:08] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: which is not what he wanted
[12:11:18] barancev: AutomatedTester: ok, localhost aliased to 127.0.1.1 -- what's wrong with this configuration?
[12:11:34] AutomatedTester: barancev: FirefoxDriver isnt connecting
[12:12:38] AutomatedTester: I agree with simonstewart that hungarian notation is awful most of the time but when you look at a directory and cant tell interfaces from concrete classes it slows down what you are looking for
[12:12:45] AutomatedTester: and forces you to use an IDE
[12:12:49] barancev: why it does not connect?
[12:12:56] barancev: in httpd.js:
[12:13:27] AutomatedTester: barancev: this is what we are trying to solve
[12:13:35] barancev: if (this._host != "127.0.0.1" && this._host != "localhost") { var loopback = false; }
[12:13:37] AutomatedTester: d0x: looks like barancev can help now
[12:14:20] barancev: and we start httpd.js as this._start(port, "localhost")
[12:14:30] barancev: not 127.0.0.1 !
[12:15:51] barancev: I'm not sure I can help to resolve the problem, but I think that changing localhost to 127.0.0.1 is not a good idea

[13:15:23] Manoj: simonstewart: Yeah, I remember AutomatedTester was shocked to hear that it will take 2 years to migrate... 
[13:16:28] simonstewart: IDEs in this case referring to IDEs for programming languages rather than SeIDE
[13:16:44] simonstewart: dawagner: I went all "two channel" on you there.
[13:17:01] andreastt: dawagner: Yes, but a little fun too (-:
[13:17:02] intchanter: simonstewart: Not to feed a troll, but I can tell you that I've avoid IDEs because my experience with some showed that they got in the way as much as they helped.
[13:17:16] andreastt: dawagner: I was travelling Poland last week.  That's not so fun (-:
[13:17:21] simonstewart: I'd really not be using eclipse :)
[13:17:21] intchanter: Admittedly, the first IDE I touched was ... um, what's it's name again?
[13:17:50] cgoldberg: some programming languages practically require them
[13:18:15] intchanter: cgoldberg: Like Java?  That may be why I can never find the code that does anything in Java codebases.
[13:18:31] Manoj: Arhhhh... okay...
[13:19:01] cgoldberg: intchanter, yes.. definitely java.. or any statically typed language with lotsa libraries
[13:19:03] Manoj: cgoldberg: Uses Python and never requires any IDE... :P
[13:19:07] simonstewart: I'm pretty at home in java. And, it turns out, my grep skillz are leet. I can find things in PHP too
[13:19:16] simonstewart: I miss grok
[13:20:15] intchanter: It was Dreamweaver.
[13:20:21] *intchanter shudders.
[13:20:21] cgoldberg: I don't use a "full IDE" for Python... all I need is syntax highlighting in a decent editor
[13:21:23] intchanter: I think I'd be more open to adding more IDE-like features to my editor of choice (vim in my case) than trying to get an existing IDE to behave like my editor.
[13:21:45] intchanter: Especially because that would allow me to customize it and throw away features that get in the way.
[13:22:21] cgoldberg: intchanter, yup same.  however, back when I did Java, anything besides a big bad IDE (eclipse or whatever) didn't cut it
[13:22:38] p_l: it's due to nature of Java
[13:22:46] dawagner: andreastt: Why Poland??

[13:35:04] nirvdrum: In Ruby, if you're not using vim, you're not cool.
[13:35:29] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I use it because its on most environments and can just run my .dotfiles script to setup my account on each environment
[13:35:56] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I dont use it because its *cool*
[13:36:01] nirvdrum: Yeah.  That's sorta where Sublime lands for me.
[13:36:01] AutomatedTester: I use it because its simple
[13:36:19] nirvdrum: I use vim when needed.  But I type in Dvorak, so it's a completely different level of whacked out.

[13:43:12] intchanter: jrock20041: A quick search shows that Spock may be a testing framework.  Given that, the answer would be yes.
[13:44:07] intchanter: Webdriver is a tool that would be instantiated in the setup, and torn down in the teardown.
[13:44:27] jrock20041: That is what I was thinking but was not sure
[13:45:06] intchanter: I haven't yet heard of a testing framework that Selenium webdriver can't play with.

[13:50:02] jimevans: I think I've been traded. Rumor has it my old team got a new hire, a 2nd round draft pick, and a player to be named later.
[13:50:26] simonstewart: jimevans: I have no idea what that means
[13:50:40] jimevans: simonstewart: it's a sports metaphor. go with it.
[13:50:44] intchanter: simonstewart: I think he's speaking baseball.
[13:50:49] simonstewart: Go team!

[13:50:53] simonstewart: Yay! Sport thing!

[13:52:11] adamgoucher: were you put on waivers first?

[13:53:01] jimevans: adamgoucher: no, we haven't reached the trading deadline yet. i didn't have to clear waivers. 
[13:53:25] adamgoucher: (the european part of the channel is so confused right now)
[13:53:33] jimevans: indeed :)
[13:53:40] simonstewart: It's something about fishing
[13:53:44] simonstewart: Pretty sure about that.
[13:53:48] simonstewart: They talked about waders
[13:54:02] AutomatedTester: what is baseball? is that the sport where there is only 2 countries involved in the "World Series"
[13:54:08] adamgoucher: i was at a course in albequrque and took a bunch of europoeans to a aaa game.
[13:54:10] simonstewart: They're opaque, or at best translucent, waders
[13:54:27] intchanter: AutomatedTester: That's more countries than I was aware of, but I'm American.
[13:54:41] AutomatedTester: intchanter: I thought Canadian teams played too
[13:54:47] danielwh has joined #selenium
[13:54:58] intchanter: Might be?
[13:55:02] adamgoucher: team singular; the americans stole the other one :P
[13:55:15] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: do canadians play in the world series?
[13:55:19] AutomatedTester: as in canadian teams
[13:55:20] jimevans: when i was in SFO last, we had a team outing to a giants game. i was the official resource about what was happening. :)
[13:55:43] adamgoucher: toronto is a canadian city, yes
[13:55:50] intchanter: Too many Americans think USA = World.
[13:56:23] AutomatedTester: intchanter: to be honest most Americans think their state == World
[13:56:26] jimevans: there used to be two major league (major league would be like English Premier League in "football") teams in canada, one in toronto, one in montreal. 
[13:56:35] simonstewart: It is obvious that London == World
[13:56:37] intchanter: AutomatedTester: True.
[13:56:41] jimevans: the one in toronto is still there.
[13:57:13] intchanter: Some day I'll figure out why the rest of the world gets lots of news about goings-on in USA, but USA gets nearly none from outside.
[13:57:36] AutomatedTester: intchanter: its simple... if its not sensationalist its not on US TV
[13:58:09] adamgoucher: (there is so many levels of meta-troll going on right now :D)
[13:58:24] AutomatedTester: hehe
[13:59:24] barancev: China == World, actually
[13:59:51] jimevans: AutomatedTester: regarding the "world series", much like there are those who believe that EPL is the highest level of association football in the world, and the champion thereof would be classified as the best football team in the world, the american major leagues are generally regarded as the highest level of that sport in the world.
[13:59:52] AutomatedTester: World == World
[13:59:55] AutomatedTester: actually
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Mar 22 14:00:11 2013]
[14:00:11] AutomatedTester: EPL?
[14:00:20] jimevans: English Premier League.
[14:00:34] AutomatedTester: I disagree
[14:01:01] jimevans: i didn't say i agreed with the premise in football, only there are those who do. :)
[14:01:16] AutomatedTester: jimevans: there is a world club tournament http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup

[14:02:08] simonstewart: sweet
[14:02:09] jimevans: and as i was just about to type, baseball doesn't have a true "world cup" analogue either for national teams or for club teams.
[14:02:28] simonstewart: adamgoucher: I laughed at your post about uploading files
[14:02:50] simonstewart: Where you go into a great deal of depth in RC, and then just say "WebDriver just works"

[14:08:01] simonstewart: heh
[14:09:49] jimevans: so now that there are people engaged in discussion in the channel, i pose my question from a couple of days ago once more. i managed to cobble together a version of IEDriverServer.exe that doesn't depend on ATL, but it's a pretty major rearchitecture of the driver. the major advantage to it is being able to theoretically build the IE driver with the free (as in beer) Visual C++ Express Edition. would anyone really care if i did this? discuss.
[14:10:10] AutomatedTester: free beer
[14:10:12] AutomatedTester: awesome
[14:10:13] AutomatedTester: where
[14:10:27] simonstewart: jimevans: will it lead to an increase in contributions?
[14:10:43] simonstewart: And what will the impact of the change be on MS doing code drops to the IE driver?
[14:10:43] jimevans: simonstewart: no earthly idea.
[14:11:03] jimevans: simonstewart: and i've yet to see a code drop.
[14:11:25] adamgoucher: and, do you like this artchitecture better than the atl dependent version
[14:11:27] simonstewart: I don't know what the internal coding practices at MS are. Might be worth pinging them?

[14:13:15] jimevans: adamgoucher: i think they each have plusses and minuses. the biggest, most intrusive change is that the COM smart pointers you use in the non-ATL version throw exceptions instead of just returning error codes.
[14:14:11] jimevans: the scariest change is the need to replicate how ATL is able to use instance methods of classes as windows callback functions. hint: it's really ugly.
[14:14:35] simonstewart: Does it make the code easier to understand?
[14:16:12] Unode has joined #selenium
[14:16:45] davehunt has joined #selenium
[14:17:17] jimevans: simonstewart: i don't know. the ATL code might be easier to follow, but it relies on macros to hide most of that complexity.
[14:18:09] jimevans: i certainly have a *much* better understanding of what, exactly, ATL is doing in the features of it I'm using. :)
[14:18:31] jimevans: so the project wasn't a total waste.
[14:19:21] simonstewart: And has the ATL stuff got in the way of your debugging with the all macros?
[14:19:39] d0x: AutomatedTester: Change it to localhost haven't solved the problem
[14:19:56] d0x: :(
[14:20:11] AutomatedTester: d0x: dunno then
[14:20:24] AutomatedTester: d0x: I have never seen that issue :(
[14:20:29] jimevans: simonstewart: no, it really hasn't. in truth, the only advantage to removing ATL is to remove the need for Visual Studio Professional or better.
[14:20:41] simonstewart: k
[14:20:44] d0x: I will check it later again. It's interesting to browes through your code :)
[14:21:03] d0x: I try to reproduce it in a easy way and file a bug
[14:21:11] d0x: *will
[14:21:38] simonstewart: Final question: any idea of the distribution of possible committers who have VS Express but not VS Pro? As in, do we think that those most likely to contribute don't have access to a full version of VS?
[14:22:06] jimevans: i might, however, go through the exercise of replacing the CComPtr, CComBSTR and CComVariant usage with their non-ATL equivalents in the main code line (_com_ptr_t, _bstr_t, and _variant_t, respectively)
[14:23:11] simonstewart: that sounds like a reasonable step
[14:23:57] jimevans: simonstewart: that is a good question. all of the people who've been serious about contributing to the IE driver (both of them) have made the effort to obtain VS Pro, but for an individual, it's a really high-cost barrier to entry.
[14:24:10] simonstewart: right
[14:24:34] simonstewart: I'm wondering how many potential contributors are using the IE driver becauase they have to at work
[14:24:49] simonstewart: (in which case, their work has probably swallowed the cost of VS)
[14:25:15] jimevans: an individual license for VS Pro 2012 is US$499.
[14:25:15] simonstewart: If we think that there's a decent chunk of people who are interested in contributing to sharpen their C++ or because they're interested, the picture changes

[14:27:54] simonstewart: sounds like you've made your choice
[14:27:55] AutomatedTester: crazy idea, put it on the blog/twitter for feedback

[14:56:09] intchanter: That query should probably go on the mailing list as well.
[14:56:51] intchanter: In my mind, even a handful of additional contributions would justify the change.
[14:57:32] jimevans: llaskin: so the reason is that you don't have visual studio, or that you have to have a paid version of visual studio to do so? if you could use visual c++ express edition to hack on it, would you?

[18:09:02] barancev: it looks like the issue we faced in IE -- with persistent hovering
[18:09:42] danielwh: What OS?
[18:10:02] barancev: windows
[18:10:22] barancev: the browser in in focus
[18:10:34] barancev: if the mouse is inside the window -- all is ok
[18:10:50] barancev: if it is outside the browser window hover is not persistent
[18:11:57] danielwh: The underlying code is the same
[18:12:00] danielwh: Could be the same problem :)
[18:12:14] barancev: I'm looking into interactions.cpp and see gEnablePersistentEventFiring property, must be this parameter

[18:13:16] barancev: it's false by default

[18:25:39] jimevans: the persistent-hover "fix" is a hack of the highest order. it is absolutely the *wrong* way to do native events on windows.
[18:27:03] barancev: so in IE we've found the way to make hover persistent, right?
[18:27:07] jimevans: unfortunately, the *right* way to do native events requires that the window has focus.
[18:27:17] jimevans: barancev: no, we really didn't
[18:27:37] barancev: even with requireFocus capability?
[18:27:39] jimevans: what we found a way to do was repeat the hover several thousand times every second.
[18:27:49] jimevans: requireWindowFocus works, yes.
[18:27:52] jimevans: that's the right way to do it.
[18:28:00] jimevans: and solves the problem correctly.
[18:28:06] barancev: can we port this solution to FF?
[18:28:24] mreedell-work has joined #selenium
[18:28:29] jimevans: you're welcome to try. :)
[18:28:54] barancev: is it possible in theory? is there something IE-specific?
[18:29:14] jimevans: the implementation is in InputManager.cpp, which is highly IE-specific.
[18:29:36] barancev: oops...
[18:30:57] *jimevans wants m-day to arrive soon, to render this entire discussion moot.

[20:45:15] lukeis: you have time to read?
[20:47:30] AutomatedTester: yes, at 3am
[20:47:33] AutomatedTester: 5am
[20:47:44] jimevans: vendor lock-in for your electronic books, with no way to retrieve them should amazon or a publisher decide they no longer want to allow its distribution.
[20:48:19] AutomatedTester: jimevans: thats a pretty google argument...
[20:48:51] jimevans: not saying i necessarily agree, but you asked for reasons...
[20:49:06] AutomatedTester: I currently use the Kindle up on my iphive in the middle of the night
[20:49:23] AutomatedTester: The Youngest has reflux so has to be upright for at least 30 mins after a feed
[20:49:32] AutomatedTester: thats my reading time

[21:00:57] cgoldberg: i had a kindle fire briefly... amazon's take on Android sucked and limited you...  so i sold it.  I recently also stopped buying books for Kindle app or Google Play... hate drm/lockin 
[21:03:44] cgoldberg: honestly the best option for digital reading is probably pirating epubs to view in Aldiko Reader on Android.  sad but true.  
[21:05:02] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: so thats how you got my book
[21:05:12] cgoldberg: :))

[21:10:41] selbot2: 03 open/needsclarification IE CSS Locator img[src...] no longer working in .31 - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=5376 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Status-Untriaged Browser-IE]
[21:11:15] barancev: is it possible to detect in the driver (IEDriverServer) is this case 1 or 2?
[21:11:30] barancev: or 3?
[21:12:33] barancev: and return this info in the exception message
[21:13:14] AutomatedTester: ooo looks like I can do native touch too
[21:15:15] d0x: I think i got it
[21:15:19] jimevans: barancev: it *should* be easy, but it's not.
[21:15:29] AutomatedTester: d0x: whats it
[21:15:45] barancev: f*ck the IE
[21:15:45] d0x: why my new FirefoxDriver() gets stuck sometimes
[21:15:51] d0x: barancev: +1
[21:15:59] d0x: I tried it now with threads
[21:16:00] jimevans: barancev: it's not IE's fault in this case, it's mine.
[21:16:09] AutomatedTester: d0x: i mean whats the solution ;)
[21:16:11] jimevans: the code suxors.
[21:16:22] d0x: This i don't know. But i think i can reproduce it :)
[21:16:36] d0x: Let me try to write a test :)
[21:17:21] jimevans: barancev: however, i can make it easier, and maybe i'll spend some time this weekend refactoring that part of the element finding code.
[21:18:54] jimevans: but for now, i'm outta here.
[21:18:58] jimevans: g'night everybody!

[21:19:02] d0x: gn8
[21:19:03] barancev: btw, why does IE have so many differnt modes?
[21:20:28] d0x: I think it occurs if i use threads and ((TakesScreenshot) d).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
[21:20:40] d0x: hmm
[21:25:40] barancev: FirefoxDriver is not thread safe
[21:28:22] d0x: ?
[21:28:39] d0x: you mean if many thread share the same driver
[21:28:45] d0x: *threads
[21:29:23] d0x: i just run 4 threads with a drivers for each of them
[21:29:33] barancev: you can use the same driver object in many threads, but don't call its methods in parallel
[21:30:13] d0x: Ok, but 4 threads with 4 dedicated drivers is also ok, correct?
[21:33:17] barancev: different objects in different threads. should work, yes.
[21:35:26] d0x: http://pastebin.com/AZNnA0C9 This code fails after 3-5 iterations.
[21:35:42] d0x: I mean it gets stucked
[21:36:40] d0x: And then i get this one: Exception in thread "test ---- " org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Unable to bind to locking port 7054 within 45000 ms
[21:37:55] ShawnM: i personally found a work around with the port locking issue by staggering the threads intially
[21:38:04] ShawnM: a few sel driver versions back
[21:38:27] barancev: d0x: synchronize the ragment of code that starts the browser
[21:38:33] barancev: *fragment
[21:39:16] barancev: don't try to *start* many browsers at the same time
[21:41:19] d0x: same problem
[21:41:20] d0x: http://pastebin.com/KEqrcjYk
[21:45:22] d0x: But i think this is not the issue i had today morning
[21:45:36] d0x: because it gets stuck now in SocketLock.lock:86
[21:50:40] d0x: Hm lockSocket.bind(address); fails... address was set to localhost/127.0.0.1:7054 and lsof -i -n | grep 7054 | wc -l gives 0
[21:50:43] d0x: why?
[21:51:04] d0x: I mean why it fails if the port is available
[21:51:39] d0x: privileges is not the problem
[21:51:42] d0x: what else?
[21:51:57] ShawnM: concurrent opening of firefoxes causes this
[21:52:19] d0x: I synconized them
[21:54:56] ShawnM: do you have multiple drivers?

[21:55:23] d0x: jap, thats the simple code i'm playing with: http://pastebin.com/KEqrcjYk

[21:56:07] d0x: And it fails only sometimes

[22:01:54] ShawnM: firefox locks 7054 port but then actually uses 7055 and then releases the 7054 once open and increments i believe, seems to be firefox is still opening concurrently
