[00:22:55] totic: How do I close popups that my page launches in selenium, I tried driver.quit(), driver.close(), switching to them and trying to close them etc.. and no luck
[00:23:54] slex has joined #selenium
[00:24:04] jarib: depends on what you mean by "popup"
[00:24:16] jarib: driver.switchTo().alert().close() of it's a javascript alert/confirm/prompt
[00:25:12] totic: jarib: its an html window
[00:25:12] jarib: actually it's driver.switchTo().alert().accept() or .dismiss()
[00:25:18] totic: tried that
[00:25:35] jarib: then you want to switch to the window and call driver.close
[00:25:48] totic: shouldnt driver.quit() kill all of them?
[00:25:56] jarib: yeah
[00:26:00] totic: It works for every other browser but ie10
[00:26:22] totic: the "new window" refuses to close
[00:26:55] jarib: hm
[00:27:54] jarib: :seen jimevans
[00:27:55] selbot2: jimevans was last seen about 3 hours ago, leaving.
[00:27:58] totic: I can't even switch to it
[00:28:07] jarib: totic: you should wait for jim to show up and help you debug that one
[00:28:43] totic: ok switch_to_frame takes an index
[00:28:59] totic: how do I know what each index is assigned to?
[00:29:15] jarib: i always switch by webelement
[00:29:27] jarib: when it comes to frames
[00:29:37] totic: that one is switch_to_window?
[00:29:46] farlan has joined #selenium
[00:29:51] jarib: huh? not sure what you're asking about know
[00:30:12] totic: http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html
[00:30:21] totic: there is one called driver.switch_to_window('main')
[00:30:30] totic: window_name is what?
[00:30:45] totic: is it an "id" a class name?
[00:31:14] Keavon has joined #selenium
[00:32:03] jarib: it takes a window handle, there should be driver.get_window_handles or similar (not sure what the exact py api is)

[00:34:21] fatguylaughing has joined #selenium
[00:35:38] totic: fudge, only one handle appears
[00:36:49] totic: but launching it in chrome finds two
[00:38:58] totic: â€¦ well I should have accepted that it would fail
[00:39:04] totic: there is no official support for ie10
[00:43:43] FluffyDragon2 has joined #selenium
[00:48:37] jarib: totic: you may have to poll for the handle to appear (try a short sleep to test if that's the case)
[00:50:35] totic: jarib: will do

[02:43:30] morteh: anyone around? keep getting errors about @SESSION_ID@ in some selenium tests ive been given
[02:43:52] lukeis: what's your error? :gist
[02:43:52] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[02:45:59] morteh: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5193379
[02:46:00] morteh: thanks
[02:48:41] lukeis: morteh: looks like a problem with the tests themselves that you are running (the htmlSuite) of course you are running in a configuration i'm not too familiar with (php + RC + htmlSuite)
[02:49:24] lukeis: key is to look at whatever "$seleniumDir . $test"  is
[02:49:44] morteh: its a test suite i have been provided with
[02:49:56] lukeis: ok
[02:50:09] lukeis: does it work for them?
[02:50:20] morteh: seems to work okay apart from the errors
[02:50:28] morteh: i see no mention of sessions in the files
[02:50:38] lukeis: you wouldn't...
[02:51:17] morteh: well i dont understand how these files would cause such an error
[02:52:59] lukeis: not certain, i'd need to know what version of the server you are running and the test suite itself
[02:53:25] lukeis: (and maybe the custom firefox profile you are providing, but i doubt i need thatâ€¦)
[02:54:21] morteh: im using the latest server, how do i find out the version info for the test suite?
[02:54:23] zeljkof has joined #selenium
[02:54:53] lukeis: i'm not sure if you canâ€¦ likely they are using Se IDE to create it
[02:55:11] lukeis: that format (selenese) hasn't change in a long time
[02:55:28] lukeis: you're using a deprecated stack btw
[02:55:43] morteh: which stack?
[02:55:52] lukeis: by stack, i mean technology stack (RC + htmlSuite)
[02:56:16] lukeis: test cases can (should) be exported to WebDriver
[02:56:52] morteh: i dont know if i will have time to do that in this project
[02:57:14] lukeis: it's a migration thing, and yeah, don't boil the ocean :)
[02:58:02] lukeis: if you can start, that would be good, but there are very very very few people who are likely to solve your problem (if there's a problem in the selenium project itself)
[02:58:49] lukeis: current selenium code base I can't see where that error could be coming from
[02:59:08] morteh: hmm :(
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Mar 19 03:00:23 2013]
[03:00:23] lukeis: i lie ;) I found it
[03:00:33] lukeis: but i don't know why you are getting it
[03:02:07] lukeis: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/server/InjectionHelper.java#L343  and then look at line 246
[03:02:32] lukeis: so, requests are being made to the serverâ€¦ but a session id isn't being passed in
[03:03:47] lukeis: dang itâ€¦ barancev don't worry, i know i broke it ;)
[03:05:07] morteh: was going to try using  -browserSessionReuse to see if it made a difference
[03:05:19] morteh: but browser session / session id are different i guess
[03:05:41] lukeis: same thing
[03:05:57] morteh: hm
[03:06:32] lukeis: session id is selenium's session idâ€¦ not your web application's session id cookie
[03:06:43] lukeis: so, session id == browser session

[04:04:11] lukeis: thx ;) I always love fixing tests (especially right after i break them!)
[04:05:14] intchanter: Someone at work made the mistake of introducing me to http://onegameamonth.com/
[04:05:17] intchanter: It may be fatal.
[04:05:34] intchanter: Oops, and I just made the mistake of passing on the infection.  :-)
[04:05:45] lukeis: heh, i'm not a gamer ;)
[04:05:58] intchanter: Ah, immunity must be nice.
[04:06:08] intchanter: This is about writing games, but that may not make a difference.
[04:06:35] lukeis: after having kids i've lost all time for games
[04:06:44] lukeis: self imposed i guess...
[04:07:03] lukeis: all my spare time (like these precious few hours i have this evening) are going to open source
[04:07:10] intchanter: I struggle to find time to log into Minecraft between kids, wife, and trying to demonstrate coding skill.
[04:07:18] lukeis: :)
[04:07:38] intchanter: I've been averaging something like 30 minutes a week.
[04:09:01] intchanter: Hrm.  Why didn't that one work?
[04:09:10] intchanter: All the other ones loved you.
[04:09:22] lukeis: different test failure
[04:09:29] intchanter: Oh, good.
[04:10:15] lukeis: not so good in one respectâ€¦ it just happenedâ€¦ unless this is a flaky test
[04:10:50] intchanter: Some seemed to be when I was running tests repeatedly for patches.
[04:11:01] lukeis: ahh, sauce timeout
[04:11:12] totic has joined #selenium
[04:11:25] lukeis: not my fault ;)
[04:11:45] intchanter: Are you sure you didn't swap it with Heinz?
[04:11:53] lukeis: heh
[04:13:12] lukeis: a local place here has 'special' ketchupâ€¦ "Heinz 57 in a Huntz bottle"  (well, they used to do that at least, before heinz started making their own plastic squeeze bottles)
[04:13:52] intchanter: Squeeze bottles make life so much better.
[04:14:10] intchanter: Especially if the spout is just the right size for the viscosity of the sauce inside.
[04:14:43] intchanter: Remember life before squeeze bottles?  It was always a mess.
[04:14:59] lukeis: yup
[04:15:05] intchanter: Though I think I have to be careful who I say that to.  Lots of kids have no idea.
[04:15:21] intchanter: "There was a time before squeeze bottles?!"
[04:15:26] lukeis: ;)
[04:15:30] intchanter: That sort of thing just might make me feel old.
[04:16:05] intchanter: "You've held a punch card?!"
[04:16:19] lukeis: felt old the other day when i saw someone mention the phase "don't trust anyone over 30" â€¦ stopped for a second, man, i'm over 30 now
[04:16:38] Hammertime38 has joined #selenium
[04:16:52] intchanter: Yeah, I'm 6^2 this year, so I know the feeling.
[04:18:55] lukeis: had to think longer than i'd like to admit to figure out a decent square of my 'young' age ;)  2^5
[04:19:13] lukeis: so, i went exponential :)
[04:19:23] *lukeis losing it...
[04:19:34] intchanter: I won't be another power of two for a while.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
[04:20:26] intchanter: If I'm really lucky and technology keeps advancing, maybe I'll stand a tiny chance of seeing the one after that too.
[04:20:52] lukeis: heh, i wouldn't want to 2^6 is enough for me
[04:21:20] intchanter: I'm still learning too fast and falling behind anyway to think I'll run out of excitement.
[04:21:24] lukeis: after that I'll just be hoping my body doesn't decay too fast
[04:22:48] intchanter: Fast or slow, I won't be using it.
[04:22:55] intchanter: So I'm not sure I care.
[04:23:16] lukeis: plug in to the collective? :)
[04:23:36] intchanter: Oh, I thought you meant after.
[04:23:48] intchanter: Decay while alive is a very different question.
[04:23:56] phishy has joined #selenium
[04:23:59] lukeis: you're already decaying ;)
[04:24:28] lukeis: thankfully you're replenishing faster still
[04:24:33] intchanter: Yes, but I've managed to reverse a bit of it.  Felt like I was 90 for several years there due to an undiagnosed food allergy.
[04:24:47] lukeis: ahh
[04:24:50] lukeis: that's good
[04:25:33] intchanter: Gluten isn't nice to me.
[04:25:55] intchanter: But now I'm able to exercise again, and am trying to reclaim my knees, shoulders, and spine.
[04:25:56] lukeis: i have a friend like that tooâ€¦ gluten isn't nice to most people
[04:26:35] intchanter: I'm also able to get through an entire day of work without meds and without wondering how hard I'll crash when I get home.
[04:27:33] stephend has joined #selenium
[04:29:18] intchanter: Thankfully, we now live in a time where a lot more people are aware of food allergies, and restaurant staff are starting to get training in how to avoid cross-contamination.
[04:30:16] intchanter: I think I know how I want to decorate my office now.
[04:30:43] lukeis: with pictures of wheat fields? :)
[04:31:07] intchanter: I'll frame and hang some old computer items, like punch cards, paper tapes, pictures of ancient computers and their predecessors, etc.
[04:31:24] intchanter: Anything about the history of data storage and processing.
[04:31:35] intchanter: Including old manual method.
[04:31:37] intchanter: s
[04:31:52] lukeis: don't forget to get some classic floppy disks :)
[04:32:03] intchanter: All the way back to 8".
[04:33:55] intchanter: Oh, and I can throw in any related memorabilia.  For example, I found a boxed set of the Zork trilogy at a yard sale for $1.
[04:34:18] lukeis: nice
[04:39:43] lukeis: watching tests run on actual mobileSafari (ios) is still so cool to meâ€¦ looking forward to axing iphoneDriver from the source tree ;)
[04:41:26] intchanter: I love seeing progress too.
[04:41:57] intchanter: We've come so far, and I have trouble imagining what the next 30 years will bring.
[04:42:34] lukeis: i honestly can't imagine :) 
[04:42:41] intchanter: The past 30 took us from the first Apple, Commodore, and TRS computers all the way to now.
[04:43:26] intchanter: Now there's talk of cars made on 3D printers traveling from LA to NY on 10 gallons of diesel.
[04:43:44] intchanter: And I'm sure we're only scratching the surface.
[04:44:18] lukeis: 3D printing is to me like an iphone is to our grandparents ;)
[04:44:45] intchanter: It seems foreign, alien, futuristic.
[04:45:25] lukeis: yep, i should spend some time looking at how it *really* works
[04:45:31] intchanter: Especially when they start talking about using high resolution 3D printers to print the extracellular matrix that makes up an organ and then populate it with your own cells.
[04:46:20] intchanter: At its core, 3D printing is pretty simple.  Picture a glue gun attached to an old plotter or a CNC.
[04:46:23] lukeis: high rez 3D printahs of teh futur3â€¦ print urself!
[04:46:39] intchanter: It lays down one layer of material at a time, which then cools and hardens.
[04:47:12] girija_ has joined #selenium
[04:47:14] Pavan has joined #selenium
[04:47:39] intchanter: There are other processes that differ slightly, but that's the basics.
[04:48:16] intchanter: Once you have a printer, you just need the raw material and a design to make just about anything.
[04:48:57] intchanter: Assuming, for now, that it can be made from mostly a single material (usually plastic at this point, but there are processes for metal and other materials).
[04:51:42] bujji has joined #selenium
[04:51:47] lukeis: in my mind it won't actually breakthrough as a viable tech until the cost to manufacture/ship is lower or equivalent to the cost to make it 'for real'
[04:52:22] intchanter: It's approaching from a different angle.
[04:52:50] intchanter: There are online shops now where you can buy designs to print yourself, and usually for less cost that you can get them pre-made.
[04:53:12] lukeis: there ya go ;) costs less there
[04:53:39] intchanter: And manufacturers are starting to use the flexibility of being able to print one-off designs without having to re-tool for each changeover to offer custom designs, styles, and colors to their customers.
[04:54:21] intchanter: So you can customize your item before you purchase it, see how it will look, and then get it shipped within a couple of days.
[04:54:56] xiaoli has left #selenium
[04:55:17] intchanter: On a similar direction, there's a group working on creating a set of open source homesteading and farming tools.
[04:55:44] intchanter: The plan is to have them complement each other and be able to be used to replicate themselves.
[04:56:31] intchanter: They'll still need a human operator at this point, but you can then add some raw materials and some personal time to make a copy for your neighbor.
[04:56:38] intchanter: Or make spare parts for your own.
[04:58:01] intchanter: The creation story goes that the originator decided to try his hand at farming, but found he was spending all his money on tractor repairs.
[04:58:23] intchanter: So he figured there should be a less expensive way to run a farm.

[05:30:29] seleniumuser: well i did earlier.. type the whole question.. without any luck.. so checking this time.. 
[05:31:02] seleniumuser: anyways.. here goes. I got the latest build and not seeing the 3 dlls that were present before.. 
[05:31:40] seleniumuser: for C# driver: Castle.Core.dll, Ionic.Zip.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.dll
[05:31:52] seleniumuser: any reason why they are missing? 
[05:32:02] seleniumuser: my project does not compile with the latest dll's 
[05:32:05] lukeis: just read your old query tooâ€¦ are you running on Windows 8?
[05:32:25] seleniumuser: and also IEDriverSEtup.exe is not being picked up 
[05:32:29] seleniumuser: from the PATH
[05:32:31] seleniumuser: no win7
[05:32:38] lukeis: those files are needed
[05:32:56] lukeis: 2.31.2 was made because i think there were some pacakaging issues
[05:33:04] seleniumuser: yes they are.. but they are not present in the latest package
[05:33:49] lukeis: kindly send an email to the selenium-developers mailing list about thatâ€¦ responsible parties read that :)

[05:37:16] intchanter: Two things...
[05:37:34] intchanter: 1. PATH expects directory names, and the OS searches those directories for executables.
[05:38:07] intchanter: 2. I'm not sure the executable it's looking for is IEDriverSetup.exe.  I'd expect to see one without "Setup" in its name... maybe.
[05:40:22] seleniumuser: not sure what you mean by your second
[05:41:09] intchanter: I'd expect it to be called IEDriver.exe rather than IEDriverSetup.exe.  What happens if you run the one that's there?
[05:41:19] intchanter: Manually, that is.
[05:41:20] seleniumuser: it runs just fine
[05:41:25] seleniumuser: shows up in the taskmanage
[05:41:27] seleniumuser: r*
[05:42:15] intchanter: Okay, so it doesn't open up dialogs for installing something?
[05:42:30] seleniumuser: nope
[05:42:55] intchanter: I may be mistaken on that point, then.  Just remove the IEDriverServer.exe part from the PATH, and you may be set.
[05:42:58] seleniumuser: it never did.. even prevously.. its not an install able.. its an exe thats needed by your webdriver
[05:43:14] *intchanter laughs.
[05:43:32] intchanter: Awesome!  I hang out here for a couple of weeks, and I suddenly own the place.  :-p

[05:44:23] seleniumuser: no that does not help
[05:44:38] intchanter: Does it do anything differently?
[05:45:19] lukeis: easiest way to solve some of the IE server path problems, put the IEDriverServer.exe in the same folder as the standalone-server jar
[05:45:32] lukeis: doesn't need to be on the PATH
[05:46:17] intchanter: Oh "Server", not "Setup".  My mistake.

[05:52:09] intchanter: Yes, I remembered correctly.  if anyone can be "blamed" for webdriver, it's simonstewart.
[05:52:22] intchanter: seleniumuser: How's that going for you now?
[05:52:22] lukeis: :whobrokeit
[05:52:23] selbot2: simonstewart
[05:52:25] lukeis: :)
[05:52:33] Manoj_: hey... good day all.
[05:52:43] intchanter: Greetz.
[05:52:48] lukeis: hiya Manoj_
[05:53:07] Manoj_: hey.. lukeis
[05:53:13] Manoj_: havent slept yet ? ;)
[05:53:30] lukeis: will be soon
[05:53:43] Manoj_: cool :)
[05:54:17] lukeis: i'm more curious why intchanter is still awake ;)
[05:54:18] Manoj_: lukeis: so the santiycr was mentioning that there will be a call before the SeConf about the work shop..
[05:54:39] Manoj_: intchanter: is very dedicated ;)
[05:54:47] lukeis: yes, i have a meeting with him tomorrow (err, in 16 hours) about it
[05:54:58] intchanter: It's just midnight here.  Don't have to get up until 06:30.
[05:55:14] intchanter: Which probably does mean I should stop trying to make a game and get some rest.
[05:55:18] lukeis: ah, i thought you were on the east coast for some reason
[05:55:24] Manoj_: Oh ok, so only with Santiycr ?
[05:55:27] intchanter: Well, "game" is probably closer to the truth.
[05:55:42] Manoj_: if its a online call conference, I may join :)
[05:55:46] lukeis: Manoj_: with another selenium commiter (dave hunt) too
[05:55:58] Manoj_: yeah Dave Hunt... 
[05:56:34] intchanter: Have a good night guys, and thanks for the reminder, Manoj_.
[05:56:40] lukeis: Manoj_: we'll probably open up later meetings, right now we want to figure out even what we should even start to think about doing
[05:57:00] Manoj_: lol, have a good night intchanter 
[05:57:17] Manoj_: lukeis: Alright, I understand.
[05:57:44] Manoj_: by any chance, if there is a MOM  i will take a look on that.
[05:57:46] Manoj_: :)
[05:58:24] lukeis: not likelyâ€¦ but remind me and I'll give you a run-down :)

[15:07:26] intchanter-work: cgoldberg: I got a new project and decided I wanted to start with py3, and Dude-X_ had some work lying around so I could use it for reference to apply to the current trunk.
[15:07:29] jimevans: but i've never used the MSFT test runner beyond unit tests.
[15:08:15] intchanter-work: AutomatedTester made sure it got some more polish and made sure tests were passing or removed for being irrelevant.

[15:10:13] Stephen: jimevans: I've yet to fully delve into understanding Selenium's capabilities
[15:10:27] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, we have a lot of 2.6 laying around tbh... but most stuff still used has been upgraded/ported along the way

[17:41:31] jimevans: barancev: well, the logic has been broken for a long time.
[17:42:07] jimevans: it's almost impossible that you'd get all three conditions true at the same time, when we really want to fail out if any one of them is true.
[17:42:14] barancev: how was not it found? can we add a test for this case?
[17:42:27] jimevans: it's nearly impossible to reproduce.

[19:11:42] santiycr: jimevans:  I'm having the weirdest issues with iedriver today
[19:12:06] jimevans: santiycr: speak to me.
[19:12:13] lukeis: (my son)
[19:12:18] santiycr: :)
[19:12:41] santiycr: I'm running a vary simple test, trying to pull something out of window via execute script
[19:12:43] santiycr: check this out:
[19:12:57] santiycr: https://saucelabs.com/tests/f75052ab5d394841a3830dcd597bbd49
[19:13:27] santiycr: seems like it crashes IEDriver
[19:13:28] jimevans: window.inpsector is probably way too complex
[19:13:36] jimevans: and it probably does crash the IE driver.
[19:13:42] santiycr: at first I thought that
[19:13:56] santiycr: though I then started pulling just simple strings out of its attributes 
[19:13:58] jimevans: i hear a "but" coming.
[19:14:21] jimevans: hang on a second. lemme look at something.
[19:15:09] santiycr: oh, I may have pulled the wrong attr and it was actually an object
[19:15:12] santiycr: let me try again
[19:15:42] jimevans: i look at window.inspector in IE and i'm getting "undefined"
[19:15:53] jimevans: (though that still shouldn't crash the driver)
[19:16:19] santiycr: yeah, it's defined by a script injected in the page
[19:16:38] santiycr: https://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/HTML5/CompatInspector/inspector.js
[19:17:02] santiycr: the test is extremely simple: open a page with that script, pull something out of window.inspector
[19:17:25] jimevans: oh, holy hell, yeah. i'd expect that to blow up all over the place.
[19:17:35] jimevans: "return window.inspector"
[19:17:54] santiycr: hm, tell me more
[19:18:16] santiycr: "return window.navigator.userAgent" works well
[19:18:37] jimevans: the IE driver just can't handle returning complex objects. the "inspector" object, as defined in the javascript file is a complex object.
[19:18:51] jimevans: simple object, yes. complex ones, no.
[19:19:10] jimevans: (and i'm deliberately hand-waving on what determines "complex")
[19:19:31] santiycr: rofl
[19:19:43] santiycr: ok, so getting a string out of it should be possible
[19:19:51] jimevans: i should think so.
[19:19:53] santiycr: can it even navigate complex objects to get simple ones out of them?
[19:20:11] jimevans: that shouldn't be a problem at all. it handles jquery just fine.
[19:20:25] santiycr: I see
[19:20:46] santiycr: could we just call JSON.stringify on anything that gets returned?
[19:20:50] santiycr: so that we don't crash iedriver?
[19:21:05] jimevans: theoretically, yes. it's worth a shot.
[19:21:31] santiycr: fun times
[19:21:47] jimevans: though if the object you're returning contains element references, i don't know how stringify will handle that.
[19:22:01] santiycr: hm, let me see
[19:22:51] jcarr has left #selenium
[19:26:16] santiycr: jimevans:  thanks for the help, I think I can figure out how to avoid getting complex objects
[19:26:45] jimevans: glad to help. fwiw, IE isn't the only driver to have trouble returning objects from javascript if they're too complex.
[19:26:58] santiycr: good to know
[19:27:07] santiycr: I'll investigate for a bit
[19:27:23] santiycr: if we could just check and jsonify, maybe the fix is super simple
[19:28:21] santiycr: jimevans:  \o/  https://saucelabs.com/tests/f075210e0b594548af94d3aa1f2c7f66
[19:28:37] santiycr: thanks!
[19:28:41] jimevans: santiycr: o/
[19:29:30] jleyba: jimevans: stringify has no recursion guards
[19:29:46] jleyba: so element references will trigger a stack overflow
[19:29:55] jimevans: aha!
[19:30:21] *jimevans knew there was *something* about it that was worth remembering
[19:31:42] jleyba: for bot.inject.executeScript, we walk an object graph and convert all DOM elements to {ELEMENT: id} literals

[19:32:01] Revery1 has joined #selenium

[19:55:32] Dude-X_: cgoldberg, thanks for the comment. I am starting a new job in April where my coworkers used your SST framework. I hope to see that ported to Python 3.

[19:56:26] cgoldberg: Dude-X_, yup.  I'm starting to port it very soon.  It's also some cool new features 
[19:56:27] freynaud: nirvdrum: congratz
[19:57:33] nirvdrum: lukeis: Yeah.  SeConf is about a month after the due date.
[19:57:41] lukeis: there is a significant amount of selenium committers with (or soon to be) very little ones
[19:57:46] nirvdrum: If Simon could handle basically the week of, I can do a month after :-P
[19:57:55] Dude-X_: cgoldberg, i am going to review SST this week so that I can get up to speed. does it use py.test/nose/unittest behind the scenes?
[19:58:03] santiycr has joined #selenium
[19:58:18] nirvdrum: Are there?  I thought I missed the train.  A couple years back it seemed everyone was spitting these things out.
[19:58:24] lukeis: nirvdrum: it's not you who needs to do the handling :)
[19:58:32] cgoldberg: Dude-X_,  it uses unittest2 and testtools internally
[19:58:33] santiycr: jleyba: oh cool!
[19:58:39] santiycr: so we just need to do that on IE?

[20:00:00] jimevans: nirvdrum: looking at IE10 screenshots, what did we figure out with full vs. partial?
[20:00:07] cgoldberg: Dude-X_, the docs are good for what's released on PyPI... but we have some interesting new features in trunk that I'd love to get some feedback on.  It makes it extensible to use alternate runners (like nose or whatever)
[20:00:10] jleyba: santiycr: well, bot.inject.executeScript doesn't have cycle detection either, so it could blow up too (executeScript("return window")).  It just handles the common case of DOM elements
[20:00:37] santiycr: jleyba: interesting
[20:00:55] jleyba: Also, jimevans and I have talked several times about using bot.inject.executeScript for IE, and it's not a straight forward change
[20:01:06] Dude-X_: cgoldberg, from what i understand what my soon-to-be boss told me, it can randomize tests, and you can apply tags/labels to the tests as well
[20:01:22] jimevans: yeah, i wish it were that simple.
[20:01:26] Dude-X_: so i think for now i am pretty satisfied with what SST provides
[20:01:57] jleyba: jimevans: random question - does the IEDriverServer support keep-alive?
[20:02:01] nirvdrum: jimevans: Need to check the logs.  But there was a difference between Win 7 and Win 8.  I don't think it worked at all on Win 7.  Win 8 only 32-bit worked.
[20:02:08] santiycr: jleyba: JSON.stringifying throws a TypeError when passed a cyclic object
[20:02:15] jimevans: jleyba: emphatically not.
[20:02:30] santiycr: maybe we can just try to stringify, then return exception if it fails
[20:02:44] jimevans: jleyba: actually, i was just never able to get mongoose to behave properly with keep-alive enabled.
[20:03:24] jleyba: jimevans: I don't think the java server supports keep-alive either
[20:03:47] jimevans: nirvdrum: thanks for that. i couldn't remember either. in my atl-removal branch, i wanted to make sure my "get the current module handle" code wasn't breaking things.
[20:03:58] jleyba: I'm just poking around looking for low hanging fruit that might help us speed up some tests
[20:04:33] nirvdrum: jimevans: IIRC, the issue with Win 7 was even when running a 64-bit IE, it spawned a 32-bit broker (or vice versa) and that messed some things up.  If sebot has logs, that would be best.
[20:04:43] nirvdrum: Because I foolishly didn't write it down anywhere other than here :-(
[20:05:03] jimevans: nirvdrum: didn't think to check the channel logs! <blush>
[20:05:18] nirvdrum: The date would be whatever day MS announced IE 10 for Win 7.
[20:05:55] lukeis: there is a search ability with the logs too :log
[20:05:56] selbot2: http://illicitonion.com/selogs/selenium/2013/03/19.txt | http://illicitonion.com/selogs/search
[20:06:40] cgoldberg: Dude-X_, so the docs explain the script-based paradigm we originally built.  It's very simple, and makes getting started very trivial.  However, we ran into issues where devs are already used to the regular xUnit pattern and object oriented approach (like unittest)... which offers a lot (in terms of flexibility and standardization).  So we now expose an `SSTTestCase` class you can extend and use with regular unittest-style sui
[20:06:40] cgoldberg: tes.  so both script-based and test-class styles are supported.  The docs don't reflect that yet.

[21:30:45] jimevans: regex: once again, i need context. i don't know what you mean by "check all hydrated models". that sounds like an artifact of your test framework, but i'd be hard-pressed to be able to say for sure.

[21:38:35] AutomatedTester: well that is one valid result...
[21:40:31] jimevans: regex: so without knowing what the "Pages()" method does, i couldn't say for sure, but it sounds like your PageCMSModel object does all of its FindElement() calls when it's created. either that, or the Pages() method doesn't call FindElement() before attempting to click.
[21:41:00] Revery1 has joined #selenium
[21:41:20] jimevans: regex: however, this is a complete wild-ass guess. i don't know what object down in the call stack is actually null.
[21:41:55] jimevans: could be the cms object (doubtful), could be anything instantiated inside the Pages() method. you've not shown that, so i can't say.
[21:42:52] regex: jimevans: Here's the pages method: http://picpaste.com/pages-dWuKZLsK.jpg
[21:44:49] jimevans: regex: okay, so what object is null? i can't answer that question for you; you'll need to get into the debugger and figure it out. incidentally, this is exactly why i don't care for so-called "fluent" apis ("x.y().z().a()"). makes debugging a pain in the ass.
[21:45:03] AutomatedTester: jimevans: ++
[21:45:22] AutomatedTester: fluent APIs look nice but are a bitch to maintain...
[21:46:05] regex: jimevans: I have debugged it.  I know hwat's null here.  But my question is why it's null.  It hsouldn't be.  The object works and it's the right selector.  It only happens on initializaiton.
[21:46:36] jimevans: okay, what's null? and why do you think it shouldn't be.
[21:46:37] jimevans: ?
[21:47:48] regex: The IwebElement is null.  However the right selector is chosen, the element is on the screen, and it works in other situations.  It's not on active/etc.  It just happens when I use that element on initialization within a test method. 
[21:48:14] Revery1 has joined #selenium
[21:48:35] AutomatedTester: regex: is the element valid of initialisation?
[21:49:25] jimevans: regex: i'm sure that's what seems to be happening, but i'm not so sure. here's why i say that. FindElements() returns a collection. if the collection is empty, your attempt to access the element with the 0th index would yield a "argument out of range" exception, not a null reference exception.
[21:49:32] regex: AutomatedTester: Yes. 
[21:49:45] jimevans: just glancing at the code, i'd guess that your *driver* variable is what's null.
[21:50:15] jimevans: unless you have some exception handling that you've not shown.
[21:51:03] lukeis: santiycr1 / davehunt: do we have a means of communication we're going to use?
[21:51:27] jimevans: when you step into the Pages() method, and set your breakpoint at the "driver.FindElementsâ€¦" line, what's the state of the "driver" variable?
[21:51:31] davehunt: lukeis: I was just going to start shouting
[21:51:36] lukeis: heh
[21:51:44] lukeis: i can't hear you! shout louder!
[21:51:51] davehunt: I might wake the baby

[21:54:00] lukeis: i can start a goto meeting too (if we want to screen share...)
[21:54:42] santiycr1: davehunt|mtg, lukeis, I just added a hangout to the cal invite 
[21:54:45] jimevans: regex: btw, i'm not seeing where any of these pieces are initialized, because i can't see your base class, nor your support classes. also, realize that the method you've called "TestSetup()" at the top of your Test1 class won't necessarily be run before the other methods of that class, based solely on the attributes ("[Test]") you've used on the methods.
[21:54:47] santiycr1: sounds like it'd be easy
[21:55:31] jimevans: regex: so if you're expecting a bunch of stuff to be set up in the "TestSetup" method, it's not necessarily going to work.
[21:57:02] regex: jimevans:  Right.

[21:59:22] jimevans: salesforce.com. we're a java shop.

[22:01:56] soonick: I'm trying to set a cookie using WebDriverJs: driver.manage().addCookie('name', 'value');
[22:01:56] soonick: But it is failing. Does anyone know why?
[22:03:12] AutomatedTester: soonick: have you navigated to the URL before setting it
[22:03:53] soonick: I have tried that and it didn't work. Let me try again.
[22:04:40] AutomatedTester: anyway must dash
[22:04:48] AutomatedTester: but that tends to be the normal issue
[22:06:27] soonick: AutomatedTester: I get the same error

[22:17:39] detroniz_: I ain't set up no test :)
[22:17:47] barancev: detroniz_: go test_phantomjs
[22:18:15] detroniz_: someone added tests of phantomjs driver in selenium?
[22:18:40] barancev: we just run usual tests with PhantomJSDriver
[22:19:06] detroniz_: well, the new phantomjsdriver 1.0.3 requires the new phantomjs
[22:19:23] detroniz_: I could revert the push of 1.0.3 for now
[22:19:36] detroniz_: and repush once we have the official build of 1.9.0 phantomsj
[22:19:55] barancev: yes, let's wait for the phantomjs release to be compatible
[22:20:20] barancev: when this should happen?
[22:20:21] detroniz_: would be great if you tell me where the binary of phantomjs lives
[22:21:11] detroniz_: so that I can update that too
[22:21:14] detroniz_: once it's all ready
[22:22:21] barancev: we don't bindle binary of phantomjs 
[22:22:30] barancev: s/bindle/bundle/
[22:22:42] Revery1 has joined #selenium
[22:23:30] detroniz_: so, where does the test get phantomjs from?
[22:23:41] detroniz_: anyway, I reverted the commit and pushed to master
[22:24:15] detroniz_: barancev: btw, where can I see the tests running results?
[22:24:27] detroniz_: I had the link but it's a while I don't go there
[22:25:46] santiycr: davehunt, lukeis I think our hangout crashed

[22:26:02] davehunt: santiycr: try Firefox

[22:28:08] regex: jimevans: They sell figurines there?  Interesting 
[22:28:29] detroniz_: barancev: so I reverted for no real reason. The tests could have stayed broken for a little while, given that the CI is not wired up!
[22:28:42] detroniz_: it will require, anyway, to update the phantomjs executable installed on the CI server
[22:29:06] detroniz_: who I contact to get that done? Daniel Wagner?
[22:30:40] barancev: atm I'm trying to run the tests locally, before setting a CI job up
[22:30:54] jimevans: regex: did you figure out where the null was coming from?
[22:31:13] barancev: and then, yes, we have to ask dawagner to install phantomjs binary to the CI server
[22:31:20] detroniz_: AutomatedTester: dude, I like the idea of a proxy that translates Selenium Wire Protocol to MArionette Protocol
[22:31:41] detroniz_: BUT the name ... I think it confuses people. At least, it's a bit confusing to an idiot like me.

[22:37:52] jimevans: regex: i'd be willing to bet that the problem isn't directly in your selenium code, but either in the assumptions you're making about MbUnit running the test methods, or in the framework code where something's not getting initialized properly.
