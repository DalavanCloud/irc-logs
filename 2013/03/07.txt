[08:55:29] Manoj: http://watirmelon.com/2012/12/19/using-webdriver-to-automatically-check-for-javascript-errors-on-every-page/
[08:56:32] rigel: i honestly have no idea. i use python. i should have said that.
[08:56:55] rigel: i am barely literate with that
[08:58:00] Manoj: Have you atleast read what's written there ?
[08:58:40] rigel: yes, i have no idea what it says, tbqh

[08:59:19] mbersoult has joined #selenium
[08:59:41] rigel: when a page automatically refers to an additional page, like a separate .css file, and this is loaded in the background, how do i look at its source with selenium
[08:59:44] Manoj: then probably, you should rephrase your question so that all understands.
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Mar  7 09:00:17 2013]
[09:00:17] rigel: is that clearer?
[09:00:30] stan has joined #selenium
[09:00:48] Manoj: there is an API for getting source of page driver.getPasgeSource(); and you can do what ever with that.
[09:01:24] samphippen has joined #selenium
[09:01:56] Manoj: you can get that, have them saved in a temp var and check for anything - eg. using contains keyword to search in page source.
[09:02:02] rigel: right, driver.page_source but i didnt think you could specify which file
[09:03:46] Manoj: right, 
[09:04:05] Manoj: if your application loads in a separate frame or popup or a window..
[09:04:25] Manoj: then you will have to switch.To() to that window or frame and then get the page source
[09:05:10] rigel: its not a separate frame
[09:05:17] rigel: one sec
[09:05:43] Manoj: its upto you now, to do appropriately how ever the application behaves.
[09:06:02] rigel: if you look at the source of https://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html
[09:06:09] rigel: there are external files loaded
[09:06:14] stan has joined #selenium
[09:06:20] Lalit has joined #selenium
[09:06:22] rigel: that need to be loaded by the browser in order to render the page properly
[09:06:46] rigel: scripts like doctools.js that are loaded in other files
[09:07:28] Manoj: you need to load that url ?
[09:08:24] dous has left #selenium
[09:08:24] Manoj: if Yes, then you could get all the <a> tag links in that page and use a loop condition to open them  do checks if necessary
[09:08:28] rigel: i would like to be able to dump the doctools.js source to a variable or file, without getting it specifically
[09:08:43] rigel: because it has already been loaded by the browser so is in memory somewhere

[12:38:53] selbot2: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[12:39:24] memento: I am new to java, I am new to selenium, new to eclipse
[12:39:25] memento: huh
[12:39:35] memento: I download the selenium client jars
[12:39:44] memento: I import the selenium.jar files
[12:39:46] memento: and it works
[12:39:48] memento: no problem
[12:39:52] memento: the question is:
[12:40:03] memento: there are lots of other jars inside the lib folder
[12:40:10] memento: such as apache-mime4j-0.6.jar
[12:40:14] memento: bsh-1.3.0.jar
[12:40:17] memento: cglib-nodep-2.1_3.jar
[12:40:19] memento: etc...
[12:40:24] memento: what shall I do with them?
[12:40:35] memento: it looks like they are not needed?
[12:40:45] jimevans: memento: that depends.
[12:40:53] memento: just out of curiosity to understand the process fully
[12:41:04] memento: sorry but I am new to java
[12:41:11] memento: what is the standard in this world?
[12:41:50] jimevans: when you say you "downloaded the selenium client jars", do you mean you downloaded selenium-java-<version>.zip or selenium-server-standalone-<version>.zip?
[12:42:10] memento: selenium-java-<version>.zip
[12:42:43] memento: jimevans can you explain in detail please
[12:42:53] memento: I have the same question with lots of other packages
[12:43:05] memento: not only selenium
[12:43:10] memento: usually they have a lib
[12:43:14] memento: with lots of jars
[12:43:28] memento: but I can use the packages without including them in the classpath
[12:43:35] memento: so what is the point of those jars?
[12:44:26] jimevans: so i'm far from a java expert, but many of the .jars in the java world package their dependencies inside their own jar. 
[12:44:43] jimevans: selenium does this in the selenium-server-standalone.jar file
[12:46:15] memento: as I said it runs fine even if I dont include those jars
[12:46:20] memento: so what is their purpose?
[12:49:05] mreedell-work has joined #selenium
[12:49:24] jimevans: they are dependencies, so they're required by some part of the code in the .jar you're actually using.
[12:50:23] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[12:50:24] jimevans: but resolving the *actual* class path with what i *think* the class path is, has often stymied me
[12:51:04] jimevans: between eclipse and the normal java runtime class path resolution, there can be differences there.
[12:51:30] jimevans: but again, I'm far from a java expert, so somebody else might be a better resource than i.

[14:00:03] Nathan__: I have a quick question regarding Selenium IDE for FireFox and was wondering if anyone's able to help out. Does anyone know why File > Export Test Case As wouldn't have an option for Groovy? It looks like others have that option. 
[14:02:56] Manoj: Nathan__:there was an option for that earlier but not now. There is not much development effort for that now.
[14:03:19] Manoj: samit badle is the guy, who works on that.
[14:03:37] Manoj: if you downgrade your firefox and Selenium ide version  you can see Groovy there.
[14:03:43] Nathan__: ok, thanks. so it was there in older versions but was removed? 
[14:03:49] Nathan__: ah, ok. that makes more sense. 
[14:04:18] Nathan__: I'm trying to use Selenium to create test cases to run in SOAPui. Fairly new to this, but it looks like exporting as groovy is the way to go.

[17:29:10] manoj: how to develop a plugin for selenium IDE ? is there any documentations out there ?
[17:30:30] adamgoucher: you should, if it is even possible, be writing plugins for builder as it is the the successor to ide
[17:34:02] manoj: adamgoucher: Yes I have in mind about Builder, but just for now i think i can try with selenium iDE.
[17:34:47] manoj: so any one ? any links on documentations to build a plugin for Se-Ide
[17:36:16] adamgoucher: should be on the website at the bottom of the se-ide page

[18:13:53] intchanter-work: So far I'm planning to show the use of page maps and page objects, and maybe a basic testing example.
[18:15:53] intchanter-work: I'm tempted to create each of my examples in a few of the supported languages as not everyone there will be familiar with Python.

[18:35:54] intchanter-work: llaskin1: Great suggestion!
[18:36:29] intchanter-work: Do any other particular confusions come to mind?
[18:41:04] llaskin1: my biggeest annoyance is people that use XPATH a lot
[18:41:05] llaskin1: stop it.
[18:41:10] llaskin1: css is so much better in 99% of situations
[18:42:05] llaskin1: In over 10k lines of automation I use Xpath 250 times. 
[18:42:35] santiycr has joined #selenium
[18:43:47] barancev: CSS vs XPath reminds me of eggwar :) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliput_and_Blefuscu
[18:44:26] intchanter-work: llaskin1: Agreed, when CSS can be used, it probably should be in a lot of cases.
[18:44:31] llaskin1: barancev: no thats not eggwar
[18:44:45] llaskin1: eggwar is something on the level of SE2 vs IDE
[18:44:50] llaskin1: except its obvious there is a right answer
[18:44:56] intchanter-work: xpath seems to tie the tests more strongly to aspects of the page that are subject to change.
[18:45:00] llaskin1: btw, barancev, thats not eggwar, but rather Gullivers Travels
[18:46:18] barancev: all arguments I heard were "CSS is better because I prefer CSS and don;t like XPath" :)
[18:46:22] barancev: and vice versa
[18:46:55] santiycr: barancev: that's not true
[18:47:20] santiycr: I've given what I believe are legit reasons
[18:47:36] santiycr: AFAIK, performance is not a reason anymore
[18:47:43] santiycr: but here are my strongest ones:
[18:48:04] santiycr: - no one knows how to read XPATH anymore, while everyone at this point should know how to read a CSS path
[18:48:11] santiycr: - CSS has a cleaner syntax 
[18:48:35] llaskin1: css is better due to cleaner syntax
[18:48:49] llaskin1: xpath is good when you need to *for some reason* search based on a text string as shown on the page
[18:48:50] barancev: "no one" means "no one I care about"
[18:49:02] llaskin1: also xpath is significantly less maintainable
[18:49:14] llaskin1: cuz of all the crazy linkages
[18:49:24] llaskin1: //a/b/e//d//c/d/e/a/  F THAT
[18:50:08] leonardoro has joined #selenium
[18:50:17] santiycr: barancev: I definitely respect devs that can write and read xpath. I include myself in that group
[18:50:47] barancev: "a > b > e d c > d > e > a" is not much better :)
[18:51:18] santiycr: but that doesn't change the fact that people who understand CSS vs XPATH is still 100 to 1
[18:51:22] santiycr: or maybe bigger
[18:51:53] barancev: my statictics is different
[18:52:42] barancev: and my training experience shows that xpath is easier to learn (I don't know why, just an observation)
[18:52:46] santiycr: we know different crowds :)
[18:52:59] llaskin1: barancev: definitely disagree with you
[18:53:19] lukeis: css is easier to get the UI dev's to start working with
[18:53:37] barancev: exactly! "I disagree" -- that's what I hear as the main argument :)
[18:53:57] llaskin1: barancev: also: I'm russian as are you, so bullheaded, like you:)  It took me a while to switch
[18:54:02] llaskin1: but when I did, it was like a breath of fresh air
[18:54:08] lukeis: around these parts i find more people have prior experience with CSS than with Xpath
[18:54:37] santiycr: yup, web devs, is the crowd I know and the one I base my 100 to 1 guestimate on
[18:54:53] santiycr: and web devs are our ultimate target, as a webapp testing tool
[18:55:05] barancev: yes, with JQuery popularity css spreads, but it's not because css is better, just JQuery is so popular
[18:55:17] santiycr: agreed
[18:55:30] santiycr: "better" is a matter of taste
[18:55:41] lukeis: i end up typing a lot less using css ;)
[18:56:22] lukeis: and well, as a former UI dev, it's what i know a lot better ;)
[18:56:38] lukeis: (former full time)
[18:58:28] intchanter-work: Whoah, stepped away for a couple of minutes.
[18:58:41] intchanter-work: Apologies for starting a war, but thanks for the arguments from both sides.  :-)
[18:58:42] llaskin1: you started a philospphy argument
[18:58:55] llaskin1: intchanter as an ending to your presentation say
[18:59:03] tim13o has joined #selenium
[18:59:15] llaskin1: "and after you have realized how awesome Selenium is, get yourself involved with the community, hop int he chatroom, submit patches, fix bugs, file bugs ,etc"
[18:59:15] intchanter-work: "And always listen to llaskin1, because he's right."
[18:59:16] llaskin1: or some such
[18:59:23] lukeis: the real answer is, (unless you are using IE) use what you are most comfortable with
[18:59:31] intchanter-work: That, too.  :-)
[18:59:34] llaskin1: actually luke
[18:59:37] llaskin1: IE is ok with xpath now
[18:59:41] llaskin1: so that doesn't matter anymore AFAIK
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Mar  7 19:00:05 2013]
[19:00:05] *lukeis stopped following updates to IE ;) so that is likely
[19:00:06] intchanter-work: llaskin1: Which version(s) are included in "now"?
[19:00:19] llaskin1: AFAIK past IE9 i think
[19:00:22] llaskin1: santi had a great graph...
[19:01:33] intchanter-work: I'm tempted to drive my presentation with Selenium, but I'm not sure what it would add yet.
[19:02:11] llaskin1: nah
[19:02:13] llaskin1: not worth it
[19:02:14] llaskin1: use PPT
[19:03:04] *intchanter-work laughs, "At an open source conference?"
[19:03:31] llaskin1: use OpenOffice equivalent
[19:04:46] intchanter-work: I was planning on using deck.js again. I used it for my Nethack presentation at a local maker group.
[19:05:01] llaskin1: cool
[19:05:20] intchanter-work: At the time I selected it because it looked most likely to handle a "Choose Your Own Presentation" if I ever get around to making one.

[19:32:12] jimevans: sorry. just got back. no, even with IE9, css selectors are going to be faster than xpath, simply because of the amount of javascript that has to be executed for either.
[19:33:05] jimevans: and that's been my argument for preferring css to xpath all along. it's just plain more performant in IE.

[19:44:11] barancev: jimevans: my benchmarks shows that XPath and CSS are roughly equal in speed in IE9
[19:44:45] jimevans: barancev: and how many of the selenium project's users only care about IE9+?
[19:44:49] barancev: and they are about 20-30 times slower than FF and Chrome equivalents

[20:12:18] jimevans: and here i was just about to upgrade the projects to vs2012. :P

[20:13:38] *garndt runs away
[20:16:05] garndt: I can try to get IT to get me a vs2012 license.  Currently they do not have one.
[20:16:18] garndt: or you could just strip out all of the ATL use :)
[20:16:36] jimevans: garndt: no, *you* could strip out all of the ATL use. :)
[20:16:45] garndt: but you're the c++ master, not me.
[20:16:57] garndt: I'll wait for your patch for it
[20:17:06] garndt: ;)

[20:18:41] jrendell has joined #selenium
[20:19:55] jimevans: garndt: you'll be waiting awhile for that patch. :)
[20:21:00] jimevans: i've mentioned how i feel about not using ATL for COM programming.
[20:21:24] jrendell_ has joined #selenium
[20:22:20] garndt: I feel that I was around for your mention of that, but could you remind me your thoughts (because I'm a forgetful idiot)?  Only COM stuff I've done was in Python and Perl and it's horrendous and painful
[20:22:51] garndt: s/your thoughts/of your thoughts/
[20:25:24] jimevans: doing COM development without a smart-pointer library is like giving oneself a root canal. you can do it, but it's going to be painful either way, and you're much more likely to make mistakes without someone else handling the work for you.
[20:25:57] adamgoucher: thats a pleasant metaphor :P
[20:26:05] garndt: heh
[20:26:40] jimevans: adamgoucher: no less pleasant than actually *doing* COM development in C++.
[20:26:45] diminoten has joined #selenium
[20:27:22] jimevans: and in the case of a root canal, i know the process has a definitive end point, and at some point, i might convince myself i actually *like* that kind of pain.
[20:29:48] garndt: jimevans: doesn't C++ have standard libraries for handling smart pointers?
[20:29:54] garndt: <---knows nothing
[20:31:12] jimevans: to a degree, yes.
[20:31:48] garndt: I assume that ATL provides a set of smart pointers more specific to COM handling
[20:32:32] jimevans: indeed.
[20:33:10] jimevans: the tricky bit is that on destruction, you actually want to call Release() on the COM object. the ATL smart pointers make that happen.
[20:34:25] garndt: hrm, I think I have a lot to learn
[20:34:44] jimevans: it's not that tricky. most of the complexity is hidden away from you.
[20:37:29] garndt: Looks like _com_ptr_t gives you Release() that you mentioned without needing to include ATL.  Unless I'm confused about something, which is entirely likely
[20:37:38] garndt: I know nothing about this yet I'm diving into the documentation head first and guessing :)
[20:39:56] jimevans: we could certainly try it and see.
[20:40:12] jimevans: though there's some usage of CComQIPtr that would need to be reworked.
[20:40:13] garndt: Well yes, you certainly could :)
[20:41:19] garndt: well I picked up the C++ Primer Plus book, let's see what damage I can cause
