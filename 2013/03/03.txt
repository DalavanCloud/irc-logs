[17:17:44] sspy: How to get the href's value from find_element_by_partial_link_text in python ?
[17:24:07] andreastt: sspy: On the WebElement returned, call get_attribute("href").

[18:20:48] manoj: sspy: I can suggest you one in Java
[18:21:11] manoj: WebElement link = driver.findElement(By.linkText(" your link text"));
[18:21:11] manoj: String linkLocatin = link.getAttribute("href");
[18:21:12] manoj: System.out.println("Link Location "+linkLocatin);
[18:32:46] andreastt: It's pretty much the same in any language.
[18:38:08] manoj: andreastt: we can't expect and assume to do so. 
[18:38:24] manoj: So i just said I will tell in Java :)
[18:38:43] manoj: But i know, as you said its almost the sameâ€¦.
