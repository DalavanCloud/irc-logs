[01:06:48] selbot2 has joined #selenium
[01:06:51] intchanter: Whew.
[01:06:55] jarib: but it took some time to figure out what had happened
[01:07:10] intchanter: And then to figure out how to get a shell back on, I'm sure.
[01:07:30] intchanter: The closest I've had was a bash update that killed startup scripts.
[01:08:39] jarib: it's good to know though, if you try to ssh into a box where the user's default shell doesn't exist, ssh acts like your key/password is invalid
[01:08:49] intchanter: Was it deleted by a person or a process?
[01:08:53] fatguylaughing has joined #selenium
[01:08:53] jarib: only in /var/log/auth.log does it actually give you the reason you can't log in
[01:09:37] intchanter: And how did you get in to see auth.log?
[01:09:48] jarib: by a process. i'd accidentally changed a line from `ensure => present` to `ensure => absent` in a puppet script
[01:10:03] jarib: my host provides a rescue system
[01:10:09] intchanter: VPS?
[01:10:23] jarib: dedicated - http://www.hetzner.de/
[01:10:31] intchanter: Nice.
[01:10:42] jarib: the prices are very nice
[01:11:02] intchanter: I should plan to ensure that /boot/ always has a minimal and never-changing system for that purpose.
[01:11:15] intchanter: With a grub entry to load it.
[01:12:09] jarib: can you select that remotely though?
[01:13:07] intchanter: If I hook it up for remote console, yes.
[01:13:32] intchanter: Usually through another host.

[12:45:27] sivakumar_: <guicps89>its  may be no exception throws for step 2 . so wil not stop the script . becaz selenium.verifyTextPresent does not throws error.

[14:32:14] itsmikerudolph: re: ruby web driverâ€¦ what is the difference between web_driver.mouse.move_to and web_driver.action.move_to ?
[14:33:19] barancev: itsmikerudolph: web_driver.mouse is internal ("private") interface, use web_driver.action
[14:34:27] itsmikerudolph: What is the internal difference though, I am using javascript events to detect mouse movement, works fine with web_driver.mouse, doesn't pickup the mouse movements when using action
[14:39:15] barancev: itsmikerudolph: looking at the implementation I see that web_driver.action.move_to just delegates down to web_driver.mouse.move_to so they should be equivalent
[14:39:54] itsmikerudolph: That's what I found also, just wanted to double check. Not sure why one is working and not the other :S
[14:40:15] barancev: don't you forget to call perform in the end of the action chain?
[14:40:46] barancev: web_driver.action.move_to(...).perform

[15:08:13] RaulFR: hello all :-)
[15:12:37] atomey has joined #selenium
[15:13:38] intchanter: RaulFR: Welcome, and good morning.
[15:14:22] RaulFR: I am still trying to make Webdriver 2.31 work with the Google - cheese! Java example on my Windows XP box, using IntelliJ IDEA and still facing the "Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.remote.UnreachableBrowserException: Could not start a new session." on the line "WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();"' reportedly "Caused by: java.net.SocketException: Connection reset" according to the trace
[15:14:35] AutomatedTester: andreastt: did you ever read my email about XML?
[15:14:50] AutomatedTester: andreastt: or should I just land it and we can discuss it some other time?
[15:14:52] RaulFR: hello intchanter, hey AutomatedTester :-)
[15:15:37] RaulFR: so i decided I could use IntelliJ IDEA to attempt to debug the code, and learn more about when exactly the exception was raised
[15:15:55] intchanter: RaulFR: It says "UnreachableBrowserException" in there.  Do you have Firefox installed and available for the user under which this process is running?
[15:16:21] RaulFR: intchanter, yes
[15:16:53] tinygeo has joined #selenium
[15:17:15] RaulFR: I used IDEA's capabilities do download and attach the source to Selenium, and stepping through the code, I found that everything is executing without any problem
[15:17:22] RaulFR: to* download
[15:18:16] RaulFR: but, wwhen I run the simple program without stepping inside the code of FirefoxDriver(), it fails with the above exception
[15:19:15] RaulFR: if I set only one breakpoint
[15:19:57] freynaud has joined #selenium
[15:19:59] RaulFR: on RemoteWebDriver.RemoteWebDriver() (org.openqa.selenium.remote) line 111
[15:21:28] RaulFR: that is line "startSession(desiredCapabilities, requiredCapabilities);" inside RemoteWebDriver() which is after "startClient();"
[15:22:06] RaulFR: "startClient()" is executed without a problem, and lets the Firefox windows appear (in a blank state at this stage)
[15:22:24] RaulFR: and the program exection ins paused by the breakpoint
[15:22:31] RaulFR: and if I resume it from there
[15:23:26] RaulFR: it executes "startSession(desiredCapabilities, requiredCapabilities);" and the rest, including the Google - Cheese! example from the documentation without raising the exception
[15:24:37] RaulFR: so.. I have found a way to run Webdriver on my box, though not a very practical one, by simply pausing the program execution at this place and resuming it.
[15:24:40] intchanter: Sounds like a timing issue?
[15:24:59] intchanter: I have to depart for -work, but I hope you get the answer you need.
[15:25:12] RaulFR: ok, thanks intchanter :-)
[15:27:46] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Hei!
[15:28:07] andreastt: AutomatedTester: I'm currently in Poland doing QA workshops there, so I think landing it first would be a good plan.

[15:28:16] AutomatedTester: andreastt: ok cool
[15:28:45] andreastt: AutomatedTester: If anyone disagrees, we can deal with it then.  I only took a brief peek, and it looks okay to me.
[15:28:54] andreastt: But I will have a closer look.
[15:28:56] AutomatedTester: andreastt: have you tested operadriver with html5 aria modal dialogs?
[15:29:04] andreastt: Nope.
[15:29:17] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I am expecting issues but its best to have something so we can discuss ;)
[15:29:20] andreastt: I haven't really ever used a HTML 5 ARIA dialogue (-:
[15:29:28] andreastt: Indeed.
[15:29:42] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium

[15:30:06] *AutomatedTester runs off to make a test case
[15:31:00] andreastt: Oh I see now.
[15:31:11] andreastt: Are they embedded as HTML in the document?  Are they truely modal?
[15:31:31] AutomatedTester: well... in Firefox OS, the marionette code can see the markup
[15:31:37] AutomatedTester: but cant get any info from them
[15:31:49] AutomatedTester: reading the spec they should act like normal modals
[15:32:18] andreastt: So, spec-wise they should not be visible in the DOM?
[15:32:37] AutomatedTester: according to html5 it should be
[15:32:48] AutomatedTester: but when invoked, they should act like a normal modal
[15:32:59] AutomatedTester: like window.confirm/alert/prompt
[15:33:07] andreastt: Aha.  Can they have input?
[15:33:31] andreastt: Right.
[15:33:31] AutomatedTester: i believe so
[15:33:38] andreastt: Hmm.
[15:33:50] AutomatedTester: andreastt: let me play with it and get a better understanding
[15:33:54] andreastt: I can see how this might mess with the tests.
[15:34:10] andreastt: The whole ARIA thing confuses me, I'm going to have to read up on it.
[15:34:18] AutomatedTester: but click() says the element isnt visible
[15:34:30] AutomatedTester: so its *special*
[15:35:44] andreastt: Interesting.  They seem to block other page interaction, while still being implemented in HTML/CSS.
[15:36:07] AutomatedTester: yea
[15:36:23] AutomatedTester: but, in marionette, normal html/css actions get sad
[15:37:09] andreastt: Do you know if it sets a property on all other DOM nodes when triggered?
[15:37:15] AutomatedTester: no

[16:45:47] jimevans: however, let me give you a tour.
[16:46:12] *garndt buckles in for the ride
[16:46:24] *llaskin sits down around the campfire to hear Counselor Jim's stories
[16:46:44] *lukeis pulls out a harmonica...
[16:47:35] jimevans: the IEDriver project compiles to a .dll. this is the same .dll that used to be loaded directly by the language bindings. the .dll gets embedded as a resource into IEDriverServer.exe, and is extracted at runtime, and used.
[16:48:21] jimevans: the IEDriverServer project in visual studio is very small, not much code in it at all. basically all it does is parse the command line arguments, extract the .dll, and load it up.
[16:48:41] garndt: *whew* not confused so far
[16:50:14] jimevans: there's the notion of a "session". this is the thing that the embedded HTTP server uses to actually execute the commands sent to it by the language bindings.
[16:50:38] jimevans: this would be the "IESession" class in the IEDriver project.
[16:51:50] jimevans: the session is responsible for creating an IECommandExecutor class, which knows about all of the commands, and is responsible for executing them, sending back the results of the execution.
[16:52:02] jimevans: here's where we start to get into windows-specific stuff.
[16:53:43] jimevans: the IECommandExecutor is a window (in the Win32 API sense), which means it has a message loop, so that we can use the windows SendMessage API for communication to the executor (because it's synchronous)
[16:54:10] stephend_ has joined #selenium
[16:54:11] jimevans: and we need the message loop so that we can initialize COM and use COM object.
[16:57:10] jimevans: the IECommandExecutor essentially contains a big map, which uses the command name as the key, and a command handler as the value. so when the IECommandExecutor receives a command to execute, it looks up the handler in the map according to the command set, and calls the looked-up handler's "ExecuteInternal" method, which is the nuts-and-bolts implementation of each command.
[16:57:41] garndt: ok
[16:58:05] jimevans: the command handlers are "inline" classes, in that they only exists as header files. you'll find them in the "CommandHandlers" folder in the project.
[16:58:38] jimevans: alright. that's the basic overview of architecture how it works. other classes you'll want to be aware of:
[16:59:08] jimevans: the Browser class represents a single browser window.
[16:59:35] jimevans: the executor keeps track of the windows it knows about. (so you can do switch_to_window)
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Mar  8 17:00:58 2013]
[17:00:58] jimevans: the Element class represents an element on a page. we cache those, giving them their own "webdriver ids", and store them in their own map.
[17:01:08] farlan has left #selenium
[17:02:17] jimevans: or rather the executor keeps track of them.
[17:02:52] garndt: ah ok, that makes a lot of sense because I noticed in the IEDriverServer logs that there were lines when elements were not currently managed and then it would assign some ID to it and then reference it by some internal id from that point forward
[17:03:07] jimevans: yep. exactly so.
[17:04:07] jimevans: all javascript execution runs through the Script class, which lets you execute arbitrary javascript. this includes the execution of the javascript automation atoms, which the build process minifies and turns into atoms.h (in the "Generated" folder)
[17:04:29] riv_ has joined #selenium
[17:04:50] garndt: stupid question, what are javascript atoms?
[17:04:54] jimevans: most user interaction (clicks, keystrokes, and so on) runs through the InputManager class. this is a recent addition to the code base.
[17:05:04] jimevans: not a stupid question at all.
[17:05:10] jimevans: :wiki automationatoms
[17:05:10] selbot2: 1: 03AutomationAtoms: A description of the existing browser automation atoms - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/AutomationAtoms
[17:05:20] garndt: hah, convenient 
[17:06:34] jimevans: how these javascript fragments get mangled for consumption by the IE driver is pretty dark majick. don't go there unless you absolutely have to.
[17:07:22] garndt: good to know
[17:07:41] *garndt saves this log
[17:08:00] jimevans: if you encounter an issue that you think is in the atoms, you can update the javascript in the atoms source code (trunk/javascript/atoms), and test them directly in the browser as shown in the wiki. if you get to that point, let me know and we can talk then about how that compilation process works.
[17:08:28] garndt: heh, "if" I get to that point.  I'm hoping that I get to any point other than opening up VS
[17:08:58] garndt: although now i feel a hundred times more knowledgeable about how this voodoo works than I did a half hour ago
[17:09:07] jimevans: :) not exactly what i meant to implyâ€¦ sorry.
[17:10:05] *lukeis is dealing with atoms right now actually
[17:10:35] garndt: so all of the browser drivers make use of these atoms?
[17:10:49] lukeis: yes
[17:10:52] jimevans: that's kind of the 50000-foot view. most of the command handlers are pretty simple affairs. the ClickElementCommandHandler is probably the most complex. i find i spend most of my time in Element.cpp, trying to deal with the complexities of element visibility, and scrolling into view.
[17:11:25] garndt: ah, that was going to be one of my questions.  I see lots of discussions about how to determine things like that and wondered where that logic lived
[17:11:30] jimevans: garndt: yep, but the atoms are a double-edged sword when it comes to IE.
[17:11:33] lukeis: although not every part of the atoms code is used by every browser
[17:11:48] RaulFR: Ardesc0_H, and AutomatedTester thanks for your help and patience. I don't have a solution to my problem, but at least a workaround, using the debugging capabilities of IntelliJ IDEA, and I can continue my work
[17:12:10] RaulFR: bye all, take care, and thanks for the great work you do
[17:12:32] jimevans: it's good, in that the logic is shared in many ways, but it forces us to rely on IE's frankly substandard javascript engine, so IE is a good deal slower than other drivers.
[17:12:43] garndt: so the atoms are mainly used for getting information about things, and then native events are used to act upon that information?
[17:12:52] jimevans: for the most part, yes.
[17:12:57] jimevans: (at least in IE)
[17:13:31] lukeis: you can also disable native events to have 'synthetic' eventsâ€¦ basically the atoms code fire the click / typing events
[17:14:28] jimevans: indeed, lukeis is correct. most people don't know you can do that with the IE driver, because it didn't support synthetic events until relatively recently.
[17:14:40] jimevans: it *only* knew how to speak native events.
[17:14:55] lukeis: although I'm unsure which browsers have native typing events  (ios-driver does ;) )
[17:15:18] jimevans: IE does, two versions of native typing events, in fact.
[17:15:57] lukeis: i suppose they all do

[18:10:42] jleyba: not sure what the overall status is at the moment, but I've got a meeting with Chrome folk on Monday, so I'll see what I can find out
[18:10:47] jimevans: i'm aware. last release was two weeks ago.
[18:11:03] lukeis: that would be awesome jleyba
[18:11:17] jimevans: several changes since then.
[18:11:33] jimevans: but yeah, status update would be really cool

[18:16:51] jleyba: (or is it possible to just disable WebSockets?)
[18:19:31] jimevans: heh. i just told someone on the selenium-users list they needed to start looking for a new employer.
[18:21:28] jimevans: is it just me, or is it silly that we only allow setting native events at instantiation time?
[18:21:42] Dude-X_: jimevans, i think it's silly. 
[18:21:43] jeichar has joined #selenium
[18:22:02] Dude-X_: jimevans, it would be a huge advantage to switch on native events at certain moments
[18:22:02] lukeis: jimevans: ios-driver can do it run timeâ€¦ per action
[18:22:18] KaibutsuX: personally I like it at instantiation
[18:22:21] lukeis: we disable 'click' native event for one click at a time if you want
[18:22:25] jimevans: IE could do the same, it's just not exposed anywhere.
[18:22:47] KaibutsuX: there have been times when I have wished for switching it on, but then I realized I would have no control over the tests who decide to use it
[18:22:47] jimevans: (so could firefox for that matter)
[18:22:53] jleyba: all of the drivers that have native events could toggle it on and off
[18:23:08] Dude-X_: last time i checked Native events on firefox is twice as slow, but there are some places where you want to enable native events
[18:23:11] lukeis: it should be part of the wire / spec :-D
[18:23:35] lukeis: AutomatedTester: make it so ^ ;)
[18:24:06] jleyba: lukeis: you shouldn't *need* to disable native events
[18:24:23] lukeis: ios-driver, there are hacky needs
[18:24:39] Dude-X_: if you want to keep build times low, maybe you want to disable native events
[18:24:48] ajoslin103: lukeis: still get the 404 error with that build you linked me to (running safari 6.0.2 on mac 10.7.5) -- we're running the standalone w/htmlUnit & *safariproxy, a script so that we can watch it run.  It seems like when we switch back and forth between frames more than a couple of times -- that's when we get hte 404.         FWIW: It used to spawn a separate copy of Safari but doesn't do that anymore.  
[18:24:53] jleyba: correction - you shouldn't *need* to disable native events for browser-vendor authored drivers
[18:25:13] lukeis: ajoslin103: sounds like your bug isn't fixed all the way then
[18:25:35] lukeis: jleyba: yes, i'll agree with that 
[18:25:57] lukeis: but we are a long ways away from all browser drivers being vendor authored
[18:25:58] Dude-X_: same here
[18:26:10] ajoslin103: well that's a bummer.  
[18:26:20] ajoslin103: thanks for your help nonetheless
[18:26:33] lukeis: if you have another patch, i'll be happy to apply it ;)
[18:26:47] ajoslin103: if I can ever get this thing to build and run I'll try to fix it 
[18:27:07] ajoslin103: if I ever get time outside of work I'll try to build it on the mac at home

[18:28:40] jimevans: that's why i'm pessimistic.
[18:29:41] jimevans: and it seems like marionette's release for desktop release builds is infinitely far in the future.
[18:29:54] lukeis: apple has barely anyone working on instrumentsâ€¦ i'd be skeptical if they allocated more resources to a driver for ios
[18:29:55] Dude-X_: microsoft at least said they will do something
[18:30:32] jimevans: Dude-X_: i'm from missouri on that.
[18:30:47] Dude-X_: what's the saying?
[18:30:50] Dude-X_: talk is cheap
[18:30:51] Dude-X_: ?
[18:31:12] jimevans: missouri is the "show-me" state. they're going to have to show me before i believe it.
[18:31:22] lukeis: actions speak louder than words :-D
[18:31:53] Dude-X_: ah right
[18:34:41] jleyba: jimevans: M$ actually followed through when they said they'd help with Node.js for Windows.  I'm still surprised they followed through on that one
[18:35:32] Dude-X_: node js is getting very popular though
[18:36:45] akhet: hmm m$ keeping promises ..they must be in trouble
[18:37:20] nirvdrum: People still do that dollar sign thing, eh?
[18:37:35] nirvdrum: I tried to get the pound symbol in Apple to stick, but I guess it was too hard to type.
[18:37:35] akhet: yes 
[18:37:45] jimevans: so this is going to be rant-y. bear with me.
[18:38:08] lukeis: it's a big company, there seems to be plenty of people there who do want to do 'the right thing'
[18:38:24] lukeis: appÂ£e â€¦  I like it nirvdrum ;)
[18:38:26] akhet: not at the top
[18:38:51] lukeis: often the top doesn't always make the decisions ;)
[18:38:52] nirvdrum: lukeis: Of course, both are silly.
[18:39:07] jimevans: at the end of last year, and into the beginning of this, we moved heaven and earth to get someone, anyone from microsoft (hereafter, MSFT) to engage and join in the fun with the IE driver. 
[18:39:34] akhet: at the top we have a bunch of patent sue hungry whores who wouldnt know a good idea if it rang their doorbell and asked to stay the night
[18:39:56] nirvdrum: What in the world are you talking about?
[18:40:33] lukeis: jimevans: i think many might be bound by lawyers / confidentiality agreementsâ€¦ especially when hearing of their own versions of Driver stuff going on there
[18:40:38] jimevans: we got some traction, but i note, with people from the Visual Studio team for use with their "coded ui test" framework, not from the IE team itself.

[18:42:06] nirvdrum: akhet: I see nothing about suing.  In all likelihood, a settlement on patent sharing will be reached.
[18:42:15] akhet: a settlement 
[18:42:20] akhet: settlement for what
[18:42:23] nirvdrum: MSFT has been the single largest target of actually being sued for patents.
[18:42:36] nirvdrum: Patent portfolio sharing.  It's how all the big boys play.
[18:43:50] akhet: it kills innovation.  and the generic statement of thats how the big boys play is nonsense.
[18:43:52] nirvdrum: But you're probably right.  I'm guessing Ballmer personally told the rest of the company that no work would go on in IEDriver because MSFT is the only company in the world that exists to make money.
[18:43:56] akhet: but i digress
[18:44:45] nirvdrum: And then I guess he raped a puppy on his way to sue Google.
[18:45:00] akhet: lol go touch your surface 
[18:45:37] jimevans: yes, MSFT has joined the working group. the representative i've interacted with from there has been a nice enough chap, but the level of engagement seems to be lower than i'd hope.
[18:46:48] RossPatterson: lukeis: Perhaps a "Release ... the hounds" button?
[18:46:58] lukeis: RossPatterson:  +1
[18:47:57] jimevans: but i know dean hachamovitch.  i've worked with him. and he's old skool MSFT. his views on MSFT's participation in OSS projects is antediluvian.
[18:49:27] nirvdrum: jimevans: Well, strictly speaking their implementation doesn't need to be OSS.  Hell, they can even take the work you did an package it up into a closed binary.
[18:49:30] jimevans: so maybe someday we'll see an MSFT-produced IE driver. it'll be closed-source. it'll spring fully-formed, as if from the head of zeus himself, with no input from the community, and it'll be years after everyone else in the industry has produced one.
[18:51:09] jimevans: nirvdrum: actually, they can't do that. their lawyers would have a fit if they did. their lawyers would have a fit if there was any hint whatsoever that they had the vaguest idea of a notion of looking at my OSS code for the current IE driver.
[18:51:32] nirvdrum: ASLv2 is rather industry friendly.
[18:51:46] nirvdrum: There's certainly plenty of precedent around it.
[18:52:05] jimevans: i'm not saying it's not. i'm talking about the corporate culture.
[18:52:18] jimevans: it's a cultural problem, not a technical one.
[18:52:34] nirvdrum: Yeah. I guess it goes back to lukeis's statement of it being a big company.
[18:52:48] nirvdrum: The wix team seemed to get by okay.
[18:52:57] nirvdrum: IronRuby, too, before that ended up nosediving.
[18:54:16] lukeis: jleyba (and anyone else): can I get a code review on this https://github.com/lukeis/selenium/commit/bc59c1aea536de63174dc7328e8cb54fb947f7f6  before I push itâ€¦ I seem to be hacking away here, i'd gladly take suggestions on a 'better' way

[19:12:22] lukeis: i think powerpoint as a product is goodâ€¦ i just don't want to work on it. /me is not a hipster in hipster land
[19:12:32] intchanter-work: It also enabled an entire generation of people to claim that they were programmers without merit.
[19:13:31] jimevans: intchanter-work: kinda like selenium IDE did?
[19:14:16] intchanter-work: I think SeIDE may still have a place, though.  The recording of the steps can be handed to a test developer who can make a real test from it.
[19:14:57] intchanter-work: Access systems, and worse, Excel systems just end up being nightmares that take a horrendous amount of work to turn into anything capable of scaling.

[19:38:32] lukeis: html unit, you can extend it and set the Authentication on it
[19:40:06] ttilt: But that would mean implementing an authentication system that talks w/ the proxy?
[19:40:34] ttilt: that would require going into http level to add protocol header fields etc, is that what u are proposing?
[19:40:37] lukeis: i don't believe so
[19:40:50] lukeis: HTMLUnit has an interface to set the authentication
[19:41:06] lukeis: HTMLUnitDriver does not expose that
[19:41:26] lukeis: so sub-class HTMLUnitDriver, expose those methods, and set the authentication on the HTMLUnit instance

[20:09:19] AutomatedTester: so what we are doing is looking for disabled in the element e.g. <element disabled> or <element disabled=disabled>
[20:09:30] AutomatedTester: if it is then return true/false accordingly
[20:10:04] barancev: document.getElementById('ext-gen564').disabled in console returns true in "my Firefox" :)
[20:10:38] barancev: IE driver and Chrome driver both return true as the result of getAttribute("disabled")
[20:10:55] barancev: but "my FF" returns false
[20:11:09] barancev: FirefoxDriver, i nmean
[20:11:48] barancev: AutomatedTester: I know what are boolean attributes, I implemented last part of their processing in Firfox driver
[20:11:54] barancev: but now I'm in doubt
[20:12:11] barancev: why do we check *phisical* presence of the attribute?
[20:12:26] AutomatedTester: because if its there its disabled
[20:12:31] AutomatedTester: if its not there its not disabled
[20:12:35] barancev: the property can be changed dynamically, and attribute can be missing
[20:14:03] barancev: webdriver.atoms.element.getAttribute performs this check:
[20:14:14] barancev: value = !goog.isNull(bot.dom.getAttribute(element, attribute)) || bot.dom.getProperty(element, propName);
[20:14:20] barancev: why?
[20:14:48] barancev: why not just
[20:14:50] barancev: value = bot.dom.getProperty(element, propName);
[20:15:19] AutomatedTester: well according to MDN the property and the attribute need to be the same value
[20:15:42] AutomatedTester: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/HTMLInputElement
[20:15:48] AutomatedTester: maybe you have found a bug
[20:17:20] AutomatedTester: my understanding of the spec is the same as what MDN has ^
[20:18:36] AutomatedTester: i know let me ask one of the DOM spec authors
[20:18:41] AutomatedTester: if he is about
[20:21:23] AutomatedTester: barancev: what version of Firefox do you have?
[20:23:40] AutomatedTester: I cant reproduce that site to make it true
[20:23:47] AutomatedTester: from Firefox 18+
[20:26:03] barancev: FF19
[20:26:58] barancev: let me check in the embedded DOM viewer instead of Firebug
[20:27:03] AutomatedTester: yea I cant reproduce
[20:27:09] AutomatedTester: it all returns false
[20:30:13] barancev: well.. no matter, I can check in console -- document.getElementById('ext-gen564').disabled returns true
[20:30:37] AutomatedTester: barancev: then you have a bug
[20:30:49] barancev: it's FF19.0.2 on win7
[20:31:04] AutomatedTester: according to one of the spec authors for disabled the property and attribute cant get out of sync
[20:31:30] barancev: and I'm not alone, i'm investigating #5295

[20:33:48] *AutomatedTester isnt going to ask why people care about a table being disabled
[20:35:40] barancev: I'm just trying to understand why we have different behaviour in FF on one side and IE/Chrome on another side

[21:31:32] AutomatedTester: sspy: no it should do all links
[21:31:50] AutomatedTester: if you try interact with the invisible link then errors will appear
[21:33:52] jarib: not so sure when it's by_partial_link_text
[21:33:58] jarib: it may only consider visible text
[21:34:25] sspy: I though so too. But I've tested and xpath works on non visible links, but find_element_by_link_text doesn't
[21:34:58] jarib: right
[21:35:29] jarib: i mean, when webdriver speaks of "text", it usually means "visible text"
[21:35:41] jarib: not text contents of the node
[21:35:59] sspy: Oh, it makes a difference
[21:36:02] jarib: so you'd be able to find it with xpath, but not with _by_link_text or _by_partial_link_text
