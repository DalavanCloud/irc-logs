[2013-11-21 05:38:49] ato: Chrome can't be run headless, but if you're on Linux you can redirect the window to a ‚Äúhidden‚Äù X display.
[2013-11-21 05:39:01] markboxall, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-21 05:39:06] ato: Typically you'd use the X virtual framebuffer for htat.

[2013-11-21 05:47:28] Jaffer: ?
[2013-11-21 05:48:12] Jaffer: also is it faster than opening chromebrowser and executing tests ?

[2013-11-21 05:49:23] ato: If you're using Python, there's a useful wrapper you use directly: http://stackoverflow.com/a/6300672
[2013-11-21 05:49:53] ato: But essentially you wrap the chrome executable in a program like xvfb-run, so setting the Chrome browser binary location to "xvfb-run chrome" should do the trick.
[2013-11-21 05:50:28] ato: It might be marginally faster because the X server won't do any actual dumping to the framebuffer.
[2013-11-21 05:50:40] ato: But the Chrome browser drawing and composition will still happen.

[2013-11-21 05:57:59] chp: Jaffer i recommend not using virtualdisplay
[2013-11-21 05:58:03] chp: it never worked right for me
[2013-11-21 05:58:09] chp: and needing the x11 server is effin annoying
[2013-11-21 05:58:25] chp: phantomjs works pretty well, you sometimes have to use some hacky solutions but it works
[2013-11-21 05:59:09] ato: phantomjs isn't a real browser though, so it largely depends on what your needs are.
[2013-11-21 05:59:21] Jaffer: I am not using python and using java.
[2013-11-21 05:59:23] ato: Also I don't see why having the X dependency is a problem.
[2013-11-21 05:59:54] markboxall, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-21 05:59:55] Jaffer: my goal is simple . need to run all webdriver tests run on chrome browser faster.
[2013-11-21 06:00:04] ato: Jaffer: Well in that case follow my advise to set the Chrome binary location capability to the path of your browser, prefixed by xvfb-run.
[2013-11-21 06:00:12] ato: It won't be any faster.
[2013-11-21 06:01:10] chp: why use xvfb ato ?
[2013-11-21 06:01:15] chp: he needs headless?
[2013-11-21 06:02:26] Jaffer:  Chrome binary location capability already set to the path of your browser.exe using chromeoptions
[2013-11-21 06:03:13] Jaffer: i don't get " prefixed by xvfb-run "
[2013-11-21 06:03:24] chp: Jaffer
[2013-11-21 06:03:29] chp: whats the point of all this
[2013-11-21 06:03:35] chp: you want faster testing from chrome ?
[2013-11-21 06:03:39] chp: or you want headless
[2013-11-21 06:04:00] chp: if youre looking for performance improvment, the only thing you can do is write more efficient code

[2013-11-21 06:04:54] ato: Let me just point out that running Chrome in xvfb isn't headless.
[2013-11-21 06:04:59] ato: And it isn't going to be any faster.
[2013-11-21 06:05:22] chp: ato ill agree that pointing the displaqy someplace else isnt headless
[2013-11-21 06:05:22] ato: It's only useful if you need to hide the window on your development machine, or wish to separate browser instances if you have multiple of them running simultaneously.
[2013-11-21 06:05:45] chp: something that frustrates me is why has someone not setup some kind of dummy x11 server to send the output to
[2013-11-21 06:05:48] Jaffer: my web app is  working in chrome browser and we want to run much faster .  we don't want to open the browser as well as it taking more resource and time.
[2013-11-21 06:05:57] chp: jaffer
[2013-11-21 06:06:00] chp: you cant not open the browser
[2013-11-21 06:06:07] chp: idk how that even makes sense to you
[2013-11-21 06:06:45] chp: if you dont want to use a browser then why dont you just manipulate all the GET and POST requests going to your site and just do this all via tcp session?
[2013-11-21 06:06:56] chp: netcat can do all that
[2013-11-21 06:07:06] chp: think about what youre asking
[2013-11-21 06:07:11] chp: i want to test a website without using a browser
[2013-11-21 06:07:24] chp: thats like saying i want to test out those shoes without trying them on
[2013-11-21 06:08:03] chp: phantomjs is a headless browser that does not open a gui
[2013-11-21 06:08:07] chp: maybe that will be faster
[2013-11-21 06:08:07] Jaffer: i mean to run in silent mode without opening the browser.
[2013-11-21 06:08:23] chp: phantomjs is your only option that i know of

[2013-11-21 08:09:45] mydog2: basically, i'm curious as to how you'd get the rows where the "sec" text()=""

[2013-11-21 08:10:23] nirvdrum: blacksoul: Then not headless I suppose, since you're not on linux.
[2013-11-21 08:10:53] blacksoul: No, I'm on Windows using IE Driver... or at least trying to use..
[2013-11-21 08:12:20] nirvdrum: So, nothing changed on your system? It just started failing?

[2013-11-21 08:12:58] sanguisdex: sorry mydog2 I was in a mmeing
[2013-11-21 08:13:27] sanguisdex: so your allways looking for the second td with no text?
[2013-11-21 08:13:32] mydog2: sanguisdex, - no prb
[2013-11-21 08:13:33] blacksoul: nirvdrum: I have it as a maven project, and added some jar making stuff, extracting the exe from jar and so on... but i switched all these changes (including the pom) to comments... so the current code is nearly like before, where it worked..
[2013-11-21 08:13:41] mydog2: sanguisdex,  - yeah..
[2013-11-21 08:13:48] mydog2: and i know it's simple!
[2013-11-21 08:14:00] mydog2: i can find the row with given foo in it..
[2013-11-21 08:14:10] mydog2: just now the reverse when there is no text
[2013-11-21 08:15:08] nirvdrum: blacksoul: I'd roll back to your previous version just to be 100% certain on whether that change could have possibly affected it.  At least that's a starting point.

[2013-11-21 08:19:19] blacksoul: nirvdrum: okay... just a question: Does selenium works with java 1.6?
[2013-11-21 08:19:22] blacksoul: -s
[2013-11-21 08:19:38] blacksoul: ( incl. IE Driver)
[2013-11-21 08:19:47] nirvdrum: I believe it currently still does.  IEDriver has nothing to do with Java though.
[2013-11-21 08:20:04] nirvdrum: IEDriver is its own executable and it's written in C++.
[2013-11-21 08:20:17] blacksoul: Because, the only thing i didnt roll back: build as source + target as 1.6
[2013-11-21 08:20:25] nirvdrum: There was talk of dropping Java 6 support, but I don't think that's been done yet.
[2013-11-21 08:20:34] blacksoul: Now I deleted that build part, and it works..
[2013-11-21 08:20:55] blacksoul: neverless, I didn't got an error at compiling with 1.6 ..
[2013-11-21 08:21:39] nirvdrum: That would just mean no one's using a Java 7 level language feature.
[2013-11-21 08:22:03] nirvdrum: That doesn't guarantee class file compatibility.
[2013-11-21 08:22:24] nirvdrum: Or rather, it doesn't guarantee someone isn't using a Java 7 API.

[2013-11-21 11:59:13] Dude-X: i wish css selectors can extract text like xpath
[2013-11-21 12:01:51] davidlai: ideally you'd wish the developer added a data-attribute to the elements to associate which list or grid items are associated with which entries.
[2013-11-21 12:02:09] Dude-X: davidlai: that's true i can petition the devs to fix their shit
[2013-11-21 12:03:07] Dude-X: i wonder why xpath is so slow on firefox
[2013-11-21 12:03:34] Dude-X: or maybe it's an issue with mavericks + firefox 25
[2013-11-21 12:11:26] davidlai: no idea. I haven't bench marked xpath performance, but overall seems ok enough for most things.  Then again, the app I'm working on has a paginated interface, and there's never more than 500 entries to dig through.
