[2013-11-07 09:31:24] garndt: yes, this is in IE

[2013-11-07 09:33:47] jimevans: garndt: the problem isn't remote vs. local. it's that the driver sees the lack of a display as the problem.
[2013-11-07 09:33:50] sburjan, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-11-07 09:34:19] jimevans: clicking might be an issue. anything dealing with mouse movement.
[2013-11-07 09:34:32] jimevans: particularly with native events.
[2013-11-07 09:34:56] garndt: fortunately I have not had such an issue yet (crosses fingers).  Does using the remote webdriver not encounter these issues?
[2013-11-07 09:35:32] garndt: I assume people are running IE on multiple nodes for testing.  Just didn't know what the best practice was for doing that
[2013-11-07 09:35:47] garndt: currently it was easiest to just RDP into a machine, kick off a set of tests and disconnect until done
[2013-11-07 09:36:49] lukeis: would be better to use VNC in that case, will leave the session truly open when you disconnect
[2013-11-07 09:37:09] garndt: yea, I'm hitting a different set of issues with corporate policy on using VNC :(
[2013-11-07 09:37:41] lukeis: you could use Jenkins, make the windows machine slave nodes and then just run jobs on those nodes
[2013-11-07 09:37:43] garndt: still working on pushing something through but I'm not holding my breath
[2013-11-07 09:39:23] garndt: lukeis: pardon my ignorance, but Jenkins would just be using the RemoteWebDriver right?
[2013-11-07 09:39:36] lukeis: not necessarily
[2013-11-07 09:40:06] lukeis: you can have the job run on the node… same thing as you remoteing to it and kicking it off there

[2013-11-07 09:41:18] garndt: guess I'm trying to understand the common practice of running remote IE tests
[2013-11-07 09:42:05] garndt: so if Jenkins kicked off job on a remote node, calling things like isdisplayed would not be an issue as it is with disconnected RDP sessions?  Not sure how the remote node starts the job and renders the display (if at all)
[2013-11-07 09:42:44] lukeis: shouldn't be a problem (I don't think…) I don't actually do much personally with IE

[2013-11-07 10:41:24] lukeis: yes
[2013-11-07 10:43:13] AnnTheSailor: thank you, lukeis - this page has some great ideas
[2013-11-07 10:43:31] garndt: hrm, think I'm runing into some of the scenarios of why jimevans said to not run IE tests in a disconnected RDP session.  Seems that jquery autocomplete menus are having trouble along with a few other things. Shucks. back to the drawing board
[2013-11-07 10:44:10] AnnTheSailor: but my issue is one @Test will check the page title, the tagline, etc.  I want to break this out so that each assert is it's own test (I am using testNg)
[2013-11-07 10:44:48] lukeis: then you'll need to break it out :)
[2013-11-07 10:45:21] AnnTheSailor: yeah, i tried putting an @Test above each method but that didn't work
[2013-11-07 10:46:43] lukeis: sounds like you need some help with TestNG and learning that (which is offtopic with this room…) there's plenty of helpful pages out there if you google it
[2013-11-07 10:47:27] AnnTheSailor: yeah, it's a combo issue - maybe http://testng.org/doc/selenium.html
[2013-11-07 10:48:46] thrustcore: Sorry to be such a horrible PITA, but how do I select this item so that I can click on it? <span class="ui-button-text">Create Linking</span>
[2013-11-07 10:49:04] thrustcore: the ONLY unique thing about this is the text within the span
[2013-11-07 10:49:26] AnnTheSailor: i just was hoping there was an easier way than listing the methods in the XML file
[2013-11-07 10:49:31] lukeis: thrustcore: driver.find_element_by_xpath("span[.='Create Linking']").click()

[2013-11-07 10:52:25] AnnTheSailor: thrustcore - i agree, getting the elements is the hardest part - CSS is usually better to use if possible
[2013-11-07 10:52:25] lukeis: i use css selectors for everything else that is complex :)
[2013-11-07 10:52:28] thrustcore: ah all right
[2013-11-07 10:52:53] thrustcore: yeah I wish I could use CSS selectors, but unfortunately I'm testing a system which has a pretty unfriendly UI
[2013-11-07 10:53:08] lukeis: that's the best time to use the complex ones ;)

[2013-11-07 10:55:22] garndt: Are css selectors faster than xpath lookups in IE? I thought I read/heard somewhere that for css selectors to work in IE, there is javascript that's injected and that's use so it's dependent on the speed of the javascript engine, which is horrible in IE.
[2013-11-07 10:56:26] jimevans: garndt: css selectors in IE use the native selector engine. xpath requires an injected javascript xpath implementations.
[2013-11-07 10:57:06] lukeis: (unless you're talking about < IE8)
[2013-11-07 10:57:11] garndt: Ok, then I was really mistaken.  Thanks.  I should look at converted a lot of my xpath locators to CSS then
[2013-11-07 10:57:16] lukeis: that's < 8
[2013-11-07 10:57:28] garndt: this would be >= IE 8
[2013-11-07 10:57:48] lukeis: then yes, css will theoretically be faster the xpath :)
[2013-11-07 10:58:10] garndt: awesome, I'll have to investigate a bit once I figure out some larger issues I'm having.  Thanks guys

[2013-11-07 11:04:24] lukeis: make sure there's no other matching elements?
[2013-11-07 11:04:52] lukeis: in chrome use the console:  $x("span[.='Create Linking']")

[2013-11-07 11:06:57] davidlai: both seems to work, but wonder which one would be better universally across browsers.
[2013-11-07 11:07:04] lukeis: doesn't matter from my experience… i like the shorthand ;)

[2013-11-07 11:08:07] davidlai: I'm waiting for IE8 to die off.. once that happens I think can finally get grid of xpaths
[2013-11-07 11:08:08] lukeis: try  span[contains(., 'Create Linking')]
[2013-11-07 11:08:12] thrustcore: I found the element in the dom and "Copy XPATH" and got this: //*[@id="ui-accordion-accordion-panel-0"]/div[8]/table[2]/tbody/tr/td[4]/button -- is it relevant?
[2013-11-07 11:08:37] lukeis: that will be extremely brittle :)
[2013-11-07 11:08:45] thrustcore: this is the stupidest UI I've even used lol (I'm not using the IDE because it doesn't support firefox)
[2013-11-07 11:09:28] thrustcore: lukeis: $x("span[contains(., 'Create Linking')]") doesn't find it either in the console
[2013-11-07 11:09:37] davidlai: xpath from plugins or browser debugger will give you a hard index path.  It's up to you to simplify it.  '//' and [contains(@property, 'value')] are your friend.
[2013-11-07 11:09:51] lukeis: thrustcore: try it with just 'Linking' then

[2013-11-07 11:35:19] ato: I'm considering whether it's just easier to add a new target that calls an external “compiler”, which could just be a Python thing that does a template thing, and add a crazyfun target for that with the file deps list.  Would that work?

[2013-11-07 11:36:00] ato: lukeis: Do you do any concatentation of the fragments you use?  Or do you include each file separately?

[2013-11-07 13:57:55] ato: Unfortunately it doesn't seem like rake supports Makefile-like file dependency graphs…
[2013-11-07 13:58:27] ato: Which means javascript/marionette/atoms.js is generated every time you run the target regardless if anything's changed.
[2013-11-07 13:58:34] ato: Which isn't ideal.
