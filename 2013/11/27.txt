[2013-11-27 09:10:01] nullx: there's also another issue with selenium under mono which has a simple fix, you need to export a variable so mono fixes the paths

[2013-11-27 12:40:20] *lukeis loves the happenstance of things "working" before and then add just one more dimension to it and the house of cards crumbles'
[2013-11-27 12:41:57] lukeis: most of it was of my own creation of courseâ¦ so no one should hire me to solve their threading issues :)

[2013-11-27 23:50:11] lite_: so i have a few problems that id like some assistance with. first of all im trying my luck with the Selenium IDE firefox plugin.  It would appear that clicking elements can happen prematurely and as a result my tests are only succesfull a fraction of the time
[2013-11-27 23:50:45] lite_: inserting a waitForElementPresent does nothing as the element itself IS present. its just the underlying logic that isnt ready at the time where selenium does the click
