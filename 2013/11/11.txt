[2013-11-11 08:41:09] OliverJAsh: i'm using WebDriverJS and i'm trying to select some text, but the code i have doesn't work apparently.
[2013-11-11 08:41:10] OliverJAsh: var selectText = new webdriver.ActionSequence(driver).mouseMove(editor, { x: 5, y: 15 }).mouseDown().mouseMove({ x: 40, y: 0 }).mouseUp().perform();
[2013-11-11 08:41:27] OliverJAsh: after i select the text, i tell web driver to click a "bold" button, which should make the selected text bold
[2013-11-11 08:41:50] OliverJAsh: is there any way i can validate my select text code, or is it just trial and error?

[2013-11-11 09:39:21] dimacus: the problem i have with nightly builds is that they can get away from current support of WD right?

[2013-11-11 11:16:44] HodorBaggins: Hello.  Whenever I call $driver->wait(10)->until(WebDriverExpectedCondition), why does it keep failing over and over?  How do i just make it stop if there is a condition fails?
[2013-11-11 11:19:12] HodorBaggins: (It fails for well over 10 seconds...until the session times out)
[2013-11-11 11:20:19] Prometheian: Try reducing the wait

[2013-11-11 11:23:28] HodorBaggins: Okay, I knocked it down to 5s.  It still runs for 2 minutes until I get Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'TimeOutWebDriverError'

[2013-11-11 11:25:58] HodorBaggins: If the condition is successful, it runs quickly and its fine....but if the element doesnt meet the condition it hangs.
[2013-11-11 11:26:21] HodorBaggins: browserstack

[2013-11-11 11:27:25] lukeis: HodorBaggins: that's expected… if the condition isn't satisfied by the Timeout, a TimeoutException will be thrown

[2013-11-11 11:28:10] barancev: Prometheian: do you also have implicit waits set to 2 min?
[2013-11-11 11:28:26] Prometheian: I use Java.
[2013-11-11 11:28:30] Prometheian: So no idea?
[2013-11-11 11:28:46] Prometheian: I wanna go with no, however.
[2013-11-11 11:29:19] barancev: sorry, misclick :)

[2013-11-11 11:29:36] Prometheian: kk
[2013-11-11 11:29:43] HodorBaggins: It should just be default, but I'll check implicit wait.  I would expect it to only try for 10s at 250ms intervals.
