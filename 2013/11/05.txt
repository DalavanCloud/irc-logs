[2013-11-05 05:14:47] HashNuke_: Any docs for writing a selenium web driver binding for a new language?
[2013-11-05 05:19:51] brma: HashNuke_: you probably want to start here: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/default/webdriver-spec.html
[2013-11-05 05:20:02] HashNuke_: brmaThanks ~!
[2013-11-05 05:20:46] HashNuke_: brma: Thanks didnt know that webdriver is a w3c spec.
[2013-11-05 05:21:13] barancev: HashNuke_: what language are you going to cover?
[2013-11-05 05:21:36] HashNuke_: barancev: Elixir
[2013-11-05 05:21:47] barancev: O_O
[2013-11-05 05:22:28] *barancev is reading wikipedia'
[2013-11-05 05:22:31] HashNuke_: barancev: The erl_selenium project for Erlang is unmaintained for 2yrs now. So If I am able to write one in Elixir, it should help both Erlang and Elixir guys.
[2013-11-05 05:23:18] barancev: ah, it is erlang in essense
[2013-11-05 05:24:08] barancev: if you implement it in elixir -- can erlang users to utilize this lib?
[2013-11-05 05:24:58] HashNuke_: barancev: Yes
[2013-11-05 05:25:56] ato: HashNuke_: Note that the spec doesn't have a normative wire protocol defined yet, which is typically what you want to implement in a new language binding.
[2013-11-05 05:26:06] barancev: what about revitalizing erl_selenium?
[2013-11-05 05:26:22] dhenry, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-05 05:26:38] ato: Good example bindings you can look at for reference are the Ruby and Python bindings however.
[2013-11-05 05:26:44] barancev: ah, no, no need to revitalize it
[2013-11-05 05:26:53] barancev: erl_selenium is RC implementation
[2013-11-05 05:28:12] barancev: ato: protocol is one of the most stable parts of the standard, imho :)
[2013-11-05 05:29:42] ato: There isn't a protocol defined yet in the spec.
[2013-11-05 05:29:47] ato: But it's been decided that it's going in.
[2013-11-05 05:30:16] ato: Or did you mean the SPI?
[2013-11-05 05:31:43] barancev: yes, mapping to json is not described yet, but the set of commands and parameters is defined and stable
[2013-11-05 05:32:11] barancev: s/mapping to json/mappint to transport level/
[2013-11-05 05:32:26] ato: Yup
[2013-11-05 05:32:51] barancev: and, yes, I agree that for a language binding implementation transport level details are important
[2013-11-05 05:33:09] ato: And should be pretty safe to follow that, was just pointing out that from looking at the spec right now, you won't get the “overview” you would if the spec also provided you with JSON mapping.

[2013-11-05 12:10:09] phasze: if you want to have it in there and still choose a specific td then you'll have to do more calculation
[2013-11-05 12:10:13] mydog2: which is the part i'm grappling with
[2013-11-05 12:10:58] phasze: you could get the list of Elements from selenium and count them
[2013-11-05 12:11:00] mydog2: i don't think i can do a d.xpath(count("//td"))==5 then trigger..
[2013-11-05 12:12:32] phasze: in C#: driver.FindElements(By.XPath("//some/Xpath")).Count()

[2013-11-05 12:19:05] barancev: e.g. visibilityOfElementLocated(By locator)
[2013-11-05 12:19:26] Dude-X: why's that?
[2013-11-05 12:19:31] barancev: let's suppose I have two elements that match this locator, and the first one is not visible
[2013-11-05 12:19:42] barancev: this condition will NEVER met!
[2013-11-05 12:20:00] phasze: seems like a poor locator?

[2013-11-05 12:22:05] lukeis: and one can (quite easily) make their own ExpectedCondition… visibilitiyOfSecondElementLocated(by...)
[2013-11-05 12:22:19] lukeis: (not added to Selenium of course)
[2013-11-05 12:22:57] barancev: yesm it should be named visibilityOfFirstElementLocated(By locator)
[2013-11-05 12:23:10] jleyba: no
[2013-11-05 12:23:15] lukeis: that's implied because it's not a findElements <- s
[2013-11-05 12:23:42] barancev: I'd expect it to find all elements by the locator and try to find a visible one among them
[2013-11-05 12:23:48] phasze: findTheElementIReallyWant?  ;)
[2013-11-05 12:24:04] jleyba: That would not be intuitive at all
[2013-11-05 12:24:14] jimevans: ExpectedConditions.doWhatIMeanNotWhatISay()
[2013-11-05 12:24:37] jleyba: or just split it in two
[2013-11-05 12:24:43] lukeis: EC.findAnyElementThatIsVisible(By locator)   <- go ahead and make it ;)
[2013-11-05 12:24:48] Dude-X: barancev: it would have been named visibilityOfAtLeastOneElementAmongElelements or something like that
[2013-11-05 12:24:59] Dude-X: thats a better name :)
[2013-11-05 12:25:14] barancev: really? how about textToBePresentInElement(By locator, String text)
[2013-11-05 12:25:29] Dude-X: in element implies singular
[2013-11-05 12:25:48] barancev: if I have an element with the given locator and the given text, but it is not the first element with this locator -- no success
[2013-11-05 12:25:50] jleyba: This seems more like a problem of using compound conditions
[2013-11-05 12:26:12] jleyba: just split it out.  EC.presenceOfElementLocated(By) and EC.visibilityOf(WebElement)
[2013-11-05 12:26:34] Dude-X: when you have a locator that matches more than one, and it's not the one, i'd argue it's not the right locator
[2013-11-05 12:26:43] barancev: what if I want e.g. ANY link with a given text?
[2013-11-05 12:27:09] jleyba: write your own condition
[2013-11-05 12:27:25] Dude-X: i usually write loops in the page object
[2013-11-05 12:27:25] barancev: I can't do waitUntil(textToBePresentInElement(By.tagName("a"), "my link text")
[2013-11-05 12:27:43] barancev: that's counterintuitive to me
[2013-11-05 12:27:59] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-05 12:28:06] barancev: I expect this condition to find my link that is here on the page with this text
[2013-11-05 12:28:15] barancev: but it is not the first link
[2013-11-05 12:28:21] Dude-X: i've worked on websites that properly give attributes to elements
[2013-11-05 12:28:21] jleyba: a) you can write your own condition to whatever you want
[2013-11-05 12:28:31] jleyba: b) that condition should be killed do to confusing behavior
[2013-11-05 12:28:42] jleyba: find the element you want, then wait for its content
[2013-11-05 12:28:48] jleyba: two separate conditions, two separate waits
[2013-11-05 12:28:50] Dude-X: but if you get things like <ul> <ul>stuff <ul> <ul> with no info, then that kind of sucks to automate against
[2013-11-05 12:28:52] lukeis: better to write wait.until(EC.presenceOfElement(By.partialLinkText("my link text"))
[2013-11-05 12:29:11] jimevans: this is one instance where the .NET bindings follow a less-is-more approach. lambda expressions are well-understood by c# programmers, so there's no need for an extensive ExpectedConditions class with a list of methods that won't meet every possible corner case.
[2013-11-05 12:29:34] Dude-X: jimevans: it's good for beginners to use right away, then they can write their own.
[2013-11-05 12:29:36] jimevans: in point of fact, i wish i'd never implemented the few ExpectedConditions methods that *are* in the .NET bindings.
[2013-11-05 12:29:57] barancev: I don't want to say I can't write a condition
[2013-11-05 12:30:49] barancev: what I said is: I *dislike* our ExpectedConditions that we provide
[2013-11-05 12:31:02] barancev: because they are counterintuitive to me
[2013-11-05 12:31:07] Dude-X: does Russian have plural objects?
[2013-11-05 12:31:12] barancev: may be they are overly complex
[2013-11-05 12:31:19] barancev: Dude-X: sure it does :)
[2013-11-05 12:31:55] Dude-X: just wondering. japanese doesn't per se. Cat is cat. many cats will need something explicit.
[2013-11-05 12:32:06] jleyba: I say we just slap @Deprecated on it and start over
[2013-11-05 12:32:11] jleyba: :)
[2013-11-05 12:32:13] barancev: Dude-X: and when I use singular in textToBePresentInElement I mean textToBePresentIn *An* Element
[2013-11-05 12:32:45] barancev: not textToBePresentIn *The First* Element
[2013-11-05 12:33:17] jleyba: but the *First* element is the contract of SearchContext + locator
[2013-11-05 12:33:54] barancev: who knows what is inside the expected condition method?
[2013-11-05 12:33:59] Dude-X: hmm. i've always read the statements as is; and seeing the source code I can see it uses find Element, so I know that it will return one element only

[2013-11-05 12:34:09] lukeis: barancev: everyone, it's open source ;)
[2013-11-05 12:34:39] barancev: we can do findElements and look for an element in this list of matching element for the given text to be present
[2013-11-05 12:34:49] Dude-X: still, based on my intuition of english, and how web driver works with find element, it seems more intuitive it's only going to work on a single element
[2013-11-05 12:35:11] jleyba: barancev: What element does findElement(By.linkText("foo")) return?
[2013-11-05 12:35:17] jleyba: The first match
[2013-11-05 12:35:28] lukeis: i've always read that one as, Text that should appear in This One Particular Element
[2013-11-05 12:35:36] barancev: I expect compound conditions as "A & B" not "A then B"
[2013-11-05 12:36:09] barancev: I want a link that contains some text
[2013-11-05 12:36:23] jimpurbrick, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-05 12:36:30] lukeis: i already showed the example of what you should do :)
[2013-11-05 12:36:48] barancev: @deprecate all?
[2013-11-05 12:36:53] lukeis: quoting myself:  wait.until(EC.presenceOfElement(By.partialLinkText("my link text"))
[2013-11-05 12:37:07] barancev: well, I know how to implement it
[2013-11-05 12:37:28] Dude-X: the english expression "find text in element" is an imperative that says to look for text in a element, the By part completes the sentence: Find text in an element that is located by this selector
[2013-11-05 12:37:35] lukeis: I don't have a problem with the current ExpectedConditions
[2013-11-05 12:37:36] manoj9788: Upto what Version Chrome browser is supported ? for 2.37
[2013-11-05 12:37:41] barancev: I mean *existing* ExpectedConditions are counterintuitive (to me)

[2013-11-05 12:38:14] jimevans: manoj9788: any. :) the question you need to ask is "what version of chrome is supported by the chromedriver.exe i'm running"
[2013-11-05 12:38:14] barancev: Find text in an element that is located by this selector == Find text in *any/some* element that is located by this selector
[2013-11-05 12:38:26] manoj9788: jimevans right :)
[2013-11-05 12:38:51] lukeis: barancev: i don't agree :)

[2013-11-05 12:39:16] jimevans: yep that's the place
[2013-11-05 12:39:18] Dude-X: barancev: no; an element doesn't  mean =any/some though i understand why you think
[2013-11-05 12:39:19] Dude-X: that
[2013-11-05 12:39:25] manoj9788: Sorry I was away with using Chrome for a while.
[2013-11-05 12:39:34] jleyba: it's an implicit compound condition.  "wait for the presence of an element located by this selector AND wait for its text to be X"

[2013-11-05 12:40:22] jleyba: As I said previously, we should get rid of all the By-based conditions
[2013-11-05 12:40:31] manoj9788: No option for Mac 64 bit ?
[2013-11-05 12:40:34] jleyba: Find the element you want, then perform a wait on it

[2013-11-05 13:08:07] barancev: AutomatedTester: have you seen jimevans comment above?

[2013-11-05 13:10:50] AutomatedTester: should it fire an event?
[2013-11-05 13:11:06] jimevans: according to the test, the keypress event should fire.
[2013-11-05 13:11:11] barancev: FF24 did
[2013-11-05 13:11:41] barancev: the test passed before FF25
[2013-11-05 13:12:38] AutomatedTester: should this event fire or not normally?
[2013-11-05 13:13:21] jimevans: AutomatedTester: I don't know what the "right" behavior is. the test in the webdriver test suite expects the event to fire. firefox versions < 25 fire the event. firefox 25 doesn't.
[2013-11-05 13:13:38] AutomatedTester: ok so Firefox could have fixed a bug
[2013-11-05 13:13:44] AutomatedTester: and we were tracking a bug...
[2013-11-05 13:13:46] jimevans: that's probably true.
[2013-11-05 13:13:47] AutomatedTester: thats my point
[2013-11-05 13:14:11] barancev: may be
[2013-11-05 13:14:13] jimevans: looking at the test more carefully now, i see all of the ignores, indicating firefox was the only one that fired the event in those circumstance.
[2013-11-05 13:14:21] barancev: the test as labeled as ""firefox-specific"
[2013-11-05 13:14:30] jimevans: so i'm inclined to believe that firefox was incorrect before, and is correct now.
[2013-11-05 13:14:39] lukeis: heh, one shouldn't be able to fire that event ;)  rm -rf that test
[2013-11-05 13:14:41] AutomatedTester: sounds like we moved to the standard approach
[2013-11-05 13:15:00] AutomatedTester: I agree with lukeis
[2013-11-05 13:15:18] AutomatedTester: but I havent looked at the test
[2013-11-05 13:15:18] jimevans: wait, the event should never fire, lukeis?
[2013-11-05 13:15:20] barancev: we should change the text to check that there is no "press" event
[2013-11-05 13:15:39] lukeis: could do that too ;) but now you just failed FF < 25
[2013-11-05 13:16:21] barancev: and ignored in all the other browsers
[2013-11-05 13:16:24] jimevans: yeah, but we should guard the test for < 25
[2013-11-05 13:16:42] AutomatedTester: what value has it for FF24?
