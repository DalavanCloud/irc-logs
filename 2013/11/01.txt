[2013-11-01 07:37:01] Dude-X: patarr: do you have a link to the flex ui framework?
[2013-11-01 07:37:19] patarr: Dude-X I believe this is it http://code.google.com/p/flex-ui-selenium/
[2013-11-01 07:37:28] tim__, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2013-11-01 07:37:57] Dude-X: it says that you can use any client in that page
[2013-11-01 07:38:31] Dude-X: IIRC the flex ui stuff requires you to recompile your flash object with the toolkit and then you can access all the  controls via execute_script calls
[2013-11-01 07:38:36] patarr: ah, thanks. Must have missed it. But also, what I notice is that you need to compile in support for flex
[2013-11-01 07:38:42] Dude-X: yes.
[2013-11-01 07:38:47] patarr: aaah :(
[2013-11-01 07:38:57] Dude-X: you can't automate against any flash site
[2013-11-01 07:39:03] Dude-X: you can only automate against your own
[2013-11-01 07:39:07] patarr: Any at all in any way?
[2013-11-01 07:39:09] Dude-X: which is sensible for the most part
[2013-11-01 07:40:25] Dude-X: i suppose someone can build an automation toolkit for flash that doesn't rely on hooking into swf flash objects
[2013-11-01 07:40:30] Dude-X: but it would be type-A difficult
[2013-11-01 07:40:54] patarr: And I suppose final release build you can always compile flex app without the flex api?
[2013-11-01 07:41:06] Dude-X: yes
[2013-11-01 07:41:07] patarr: Just hopefully that won't cause any bugs to spontaneously appear... x)
[2013-11-01 07:41:31] Dude-X: i suppose you can always have a debug flag that would activate libraries
[2013-11-01 07:42:45] patarr: And what is FlashSelenium vs FlexUISelenium?
[2013-11-01 07:42:59] Dude-X: i have no clue
[2013-11-01 07:43:07] patarr: Am I correct in reading that the first is used for executing actionscript, and the second for automating clicks and typing in a flex ui?
[2013-11-01 07:43:26] patarr: Btw thanks for all your answers Dude-X

[2013-11-01 08:26:54] Dave_B_: AutomatedTester: Aha! I'd previously read http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#determining-visibility which said it needed height > 0, your link says it can be exempt if a text node (was a label with no text in it at the time)
[2013-11-01 08:27:23] Dave_B_: so I guess not a bug, though I find the behaviour somewhat surprising
[2013-11-01 08:27:49] AutomatedTester: Dave_B_: thats what browsers do
[2013-11-01 08:27:55] AutomatedTester: let me make an example
[2013-11-01 08:28:12] patarr: Is there any way to integrate flex ui automation with Selenium Web Driver instead of using legacy SeleniumRC?

[2013-11-01 08:28:49] jimevans: patarr: once again, not unless the site is under your direct control and you can instrument the flash object to expose functionality to javascript.

[2013-11-01 08:29:44] jimevans: a random, third-party, compiled flash object to which you cannot modify the source code, the answer is no.
[2013-11-01 08:29:50] patarr: jimevans: you're missing the point of my question. I understand that the flex app must have the appropriate js callbacks and such, but are there any updated libraries to use?
[2013-11-01 08:30:28] jimevans: what libraries would you need? simple calls using JavascriptExecutor should get you there, no?
[2013-11-01 08:30:36] *jimevans doesn't do anything with flash/flex'
[2013-11-01 08:30:41] AutomatedTester: Dave_B_: http://jsbin.com/ABUVAKu/1/
[2013-11-01 08:31:04] Dave_B_: aye, i guess that makes sense AutomatedTester
[2013-11-01 08:31:16] patarr: jimevans: that's what I was thinking to myself. Perhaps there is no need for selenium-flash or flex-ui. Just use WebDriver to execute JS calls?
[2013-11-01 08:31:41] barancev: AutomatedTester: this is what gdennis told about

[2013-11-01 15:19:40] barancev: will give it a try, thanks
[2013-11-01 15:22:50] lukeis: might be better to just make a simple android app that has a webview, rather than the AndroidDriver.apk because of the webserver and other stuff embedded, might hit some java class conflicts

[2013-11-01 15:42:07] lukeis: depends, did you build the android-server yourself? (does it have the latest atoms?)
[2013-11-01 15:42:24] barancev: no I use the prebuilt

[2013-11-01 15:43:05] lukeis: i think simon did it a while ago

[2013-11-01 15:43:32] barancev: not bad
[2013-11-01 15:43:44] lukeis: fair to assume selendroid would do the same
[2013-11-01 15:43:55] barancev: :(
[2013-11-01 15:44:00] lukeis: you could try to get the element location and use TouchActions class to click it though

[2013-11-01 15:44:38] lukeis: 'singleTap'
[2013-11-01 15:45:15] lukeis: so instead of using atoms to click, that will get the location of the element and send a native 'tap' command to Android Instrumentation
[2013-11-01 15:53:46] barancev: what I do https://gist.github.com/barancev/7273195 and what I get http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NAp4hOaljw
[2013-11-01 15:55:30] lukeis: heh… need to scroll into view it seems
[2013-11-01 15:55:58] lukeis: and you should configure your emulator to have an external keyboard
[2013-11-01 15:56:13] lukeis: so you don't get the soft one popping up
[2013-11-01 15:56:50] lukeis: that's the checkbox next to "Hardware keyboard present"
[2013-11-01 15:56:52] barancev: yes, I know about keyboard, but why it does not click neither tap?
[2013-11-01 15:57:01] barancev: or, why it does not scroll?
[2013-11-01 15:57:09] lukeis: actions doesn't scroll
[2013-11-01 15:57:24] barancev: neither element.click() does
[2013-11-01 15:57:47] lukeis: well, i'm not sure why there… other than maybe the zoom factor
[2013-11-01 15:57:56] nirvdrum, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-01 15:57:56] lukeis: you could disable the zooming

[2013-11-01 16:09:03] barancev: emulator option? or system option?
[2013-11-01 16:09:47] lukeis: hmm, would be in the system options, lemme see
[2013-11-01 16:09:56] lukeis: (i think it's possible)
[2013-11-01 16:10:49] barancev: internet gives only options to disable it via API call :)
[2013-11-01 16:11:18] lukeis: ah, from within the app? :)
[2013-11-01 16:11:37] barancev: yes, from the app that manages this webview
[2013-11-01 16:11:56] barancev: so cool
[2013-11-01 16:12:32] barancev: whoever uses android driver how do they live happy with it?

[2013-11-01 16:13:51] barancev: there should be an alternative solution that allows outofthebox web testing on android
[2013-11-01 16:14:10] lukeis: it's called Chrome / chromedriver ;)
[2013-11-01 16:14:32] barancev: well, it is too early for 4.4
[2013-11-01 16:15:03] lukeis: you can do that testing on earlier API levels
[2013-11-01 16:15:44] lukeis: chromedriver + chrome.apk  works (I'm not certain on what lowest level api version though)
[2013-11-01 16:15:50] lukeis: 17 for sure
[2013-11-01 16:16:10] barancev: 17, ha!

[2013-11-01 16:16:53] lukeis: really?
[2013-11-01 16:16:58] barancev: yes, it is android 3.2
