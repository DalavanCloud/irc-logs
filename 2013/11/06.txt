[2013-11-06 08:13:53] paulschreiber: Do I need to do something to make firefox find the element?

[2013-11-06 08:15:52] Dude-X: paulschreiber: it seems that firefox is a little faster in trying to interact with that element, which means you need to put in a wait
[2013-11-06 08:17:44] paulschreiber: if i take a screen shot, the element is visible
[2013-11-06 08:17:58] paulschreiber: i.e. $this->currentScreenshot()
[2013-11-06 08:18:17] paulschreiber: what's the best way to put in a wait? sleep()? $this->waitUntil()? something else?
[2013-11-06 08:19:02] paulschreiber: $this->timeouts()->implicitWait(); ?
[2013-11-06 08:19:21] Dave_B_: always wait for something explicitly if you can. Possibly in this case until the element you need is displayed? Assuming it's as Dude-X suggested and it is a timing issue

[2013-11-06 08:22:49] paulschreiber: sleep(2) and sleep(5) also fail
[2013-11-06 08:23:01] lukeis: paulschreiber: typically one uses a 'WebDriverWait' class (which is basically a polling mechanism to attempt to check a state every 0.5 seconds and returns when the condition is satisfied or throws a timeout exception
[2013-11-06 08:23:17] lukeis: sounds like you have a wrong locator if the sleep doesn't handle it

[2013-11-06 08:34:41] Dave_B_: perhaps me googling and trying to help is counter-productive

[2013-11-06 08:37:04] Dave_B_: is the button on an area that would need to be scrolled into view or anything?
[2013-11-06 08:37:09] Dave_B_: i mean the input
[2013-11-06 08:37:36] paulschreiber: on, it's visible in a screen shot. the page has no scrolling — it's very small
[2013-11-06 08:39:35] Dave_B_: oh
[2013-11-06 08:39:40] Dave_B_: you said firefox 25?
[2013-11-06 08:39:42] paulschreiber: yes
[2013-11-06 08:40:03] Dave_B_: a quick look at 2.37.0 suggests it only supports up to 24
[2013-11-06 08:40:09] Dave_B_: unless i'm reading things wrong
[2013-11-06 08:40:13] Dave_B_: (quite possible)
[2013-11-06 08:40:21] lukeis: that's for native events, could work if he's not enabling them
[2013-11-06 08:40:23] Dave_B_: so there may be unresolved issues with ff25

[2013-11-06 08:44:02] lukeis: when it comes to php, i know little ;)
[2013-11-06 08:44:48] lukeis: there is likely a visibility issue of some kind… and I would need either a link to the page or a sample html file to help troubleshoot further

[2013-11-06 09:20:33] lukeis: check the computed css… are you sure it's the "disabled" attribute or just styled that way by the page?
[2013-11-06 09:20:47] lukeis: that could be the javascript framework not allowing the click
[2013-11-06 09:22:02] dborin: lukeis: what in the computed CSS am I looking for  ? There's a crap-ton of information there
[2013-11-06 09:22:42] lukeis: likely one that matches the "disabled" class ;) that causes the elements text to be gray

[2013-11-06 13:58:49] chrismcmahon: fishing: I'm sending a string "北京" to an editing app, works fine in Firefox but the app does not understand the string in Chrome, using the latest ChromeDriver 2.6 for Linux, current selenium-webdriver for Ruby.  I tried adding an explicit encoding to the data file "# encoding: UTF-8" but it made no difference.  is this a ChromeDriver bug?
[2013-11-06 13:59:46] ato: chrismcmahon: It indicates it's not the Selenium protocol or server that's at fault.
[2013-11-06 13:59:51] ato: chrismcmahon: Or the Ruby binding.
[2013-11-06 14:00:31] ato: I say protocol when I mean transport mechanism.
[2013-11-06 14:00:37] ato: Not sure if I want to conclusively say it's chromedriver, but that would be a strong suspicion.

[2013-11-06 22:56:59] lukeis: feel free to ask (although I may not be online for much longer, but maybe others will answer)
[2013-11-06 22:57:10] saran: ANY1 HERE?
[2013-11-06 22:57:26] lukeis: :ask :)

[2013-11-06 23:04:09] cteef: why do you want to compare the commands? whats the goal?
[2013-11-06 23:04:15] saran_: and one more dobt  i have.. while idientify the object is there any pre defined order for that ?
[2013-11-06 23:04:56] saran_: by xpth..by name..by id... like these ways we can identify na... so is their any oder for using this ??
[2013-11-06 23:05:25] lukeis: order has nothing to do with it, they are types of locators (the same concept exists in RC and WebDriver)
[2013-11-06 23:05:50] saran_: i want to compre 25 basic commnds of webdriver and rc .. :) thts the goal ...want to leran webdriver..for that my team lead as me to comapre both rc and webdriver commands
[2013-11-06 23:06:29] lukeis: you'll need to read, and understand both… there is not a 1 to 1 mapping of commands in RC to commands in webdriver
[2013-11-06 23:06:41] lukeis: but you could read the source to WebDriverBackedSelenium ;)
[2013-11-06 23:06:45] cteef: do you already use rc and want to figure out how to translate tests to webdriver?
[2013-11-06 23:06:57] saran_: amoung that types of locatrs , which 1 we will prefer to use firstly,,, ?? like wise there is an order na..
[2013-11-06 23:07:22] saran_: 'm a begner only...i had use rc ..
[2013-11-06 23:07:34] lukeis: the order is truly a developer's preference
[2013-11-06 23:07:38] saran_: buy recording the scripts thogh id and convert it into rc jave
[2013-11-06 23:07:45] saran_: then i run the scpits
[2013-11-06 23:08:01] saran_: so now wnt to lern webdriver
[2013-11-06 23:08:29] saran_: as a tester point of view , what locter we ewill prefer first ??? is it id ??
[2013-11-06 23:08:43] lukeis: my preference:  id, className, name, css, xpath   (I almost never use tagName or linkText, or partialLinkText)
[2013-11-06 23:08:51] tesh, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-06 23:09:03] lukeis: all depends on the item being located though
[2013-11-06 23:09:09] lukeis: as to which will be used
[2013-11-06 23:09:32] cteef: I was watching the latest selenium google hangout on air from AutomatedTester and friends. there was a little bit of talk in there about the differences between rc and webdriver.
[2013-11-06 23:10:29] Cliff123: On the "NativeEventsOnLinux" Wiki Page: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/NativeEventsOnLinux  it says that there might be window managers on Linux which won't work. As known to work GNOME and KDE is listed.

[2013-11-06 23:10:56] Cliff123: is compiz and KWin meant?
[2013-11-06 23:11:17] lukeis: Cliff123: we test on Gnome and KDE (I think) :)
[2013-11-06 23:11:31] Cliff123: Gnome 2 or Gnome Shell?
[2013-11-06 23:11:44] Cliff123: because those use different window managers
[2013-11-06 23:11:47] saran_: can we convert IDE scripts to java webdriver testng script ?????
[2013-11-06 23:12:03] lukeis: i run Ubuntu :)
[2013-11-06 23:12:18] Cliff123: So Unity is working?
[2013-11-06 23:12:25] Cliff123: with native events?
[2013-11-06 23:12:50] lukeis: yes, i run 12.04
[2013-11-06 23:12:59] Cliff123: ok, thanks :)
[2013-11-06 23:13:16] saran_: Lukies ... can we convert IDE scripts to java webdriver testng script ????? ?
[2013-11-06 23:13:45] lukeis: saran_: yes… look at the different Test case export options
[2013-11-06 23:14:04] lukeis: well… junit for sure, not sure about testng
[2013-11-06 23:14:11] cteef: AutomatedTester mentioned a key difference: RC was a browser automation and testing library, it included assertions and verification functions. Webdriver is only a browser automation library, there are no verify or assert functions. In webdriver, the testing is left to the programming language of your choice. as a new test writer, that may be the first thing to understand about RC and webdriver. many of the concepts of writing the tests translate over, fin

[2013-11-06 23:16:57] lukeis: they aren't that different and the auto-generated source from the IDE shouldn't be used… it's really to just show sample code of commands
[2013-11-06 23:17:04] lukeis: use :wiki PageObjects

[2013-11-06 23:18:49] saran_: or it a webdriver feature?
[2013-11-06 23:19:06] *lukeis doesn't remember the full RC api anymore'
[2013-11-06 23:20:08] cteef: are you talking java scripty drag and drop items in the web browser ? if so, you can probably accomplish that with ActionChains

[2013-11-06 23:23:48] lukeis: if you got this task from your tech lead… just spend 2 hours reading and come up with it yourself instead of trying to get an 'easy out' by finding an article that you will just plagiarize and not understand fully.

[2013-11-06 23:27:12] cteef: i agree too, I don't know if there is a "zoo of examples" for webdriver, but it may help if you try to start with a small example to do something (like launch a browser and navigate to cnn.com) and build upon it with finding elements on the page and performing actions on the elements (like clicking or typing).

[2013-11-06 23:37:15] sayd: now it has me thinking i shouldnt event show the loading text and just wait to get back data before switching views
[2013-11-06 23:38:42] cteef: if you can figure out an element locator for the thing that says loading, you can use an Explicit Wait to wait for a condition to be satisfied, something like the text no longer says loading, or the element is no longer visible on the page.
