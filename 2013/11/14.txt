[2013-11-14 05:30:51] chp: is it possible to run Chrome headless with selenium?
[2013-11-14 05:31:25] p_l: chp: afaik it works like every other headless browser setup
[2013-11-14 05:31:43] p_l: (though I suspect WebGL-related stuff might blow)
[2013-11-14 05:32:07] chp: driver.Chrome("chromedriver.exe") ?
[2013-11-14 05:32:24] thrustcore: If I want to check if an element is visible, can I simply do if (EC.element_to_be_clickable(By.XPATH, selector)) and branch from there?
[2013-11-14 05:32:26] chp: right now i have driver.Chrome() and it runs chromedriver but a chrome window pops up
[2013-11-14 05:32:30] p_l: no idea how it goes in whatever language you're using
[2013-11-14 05:32:34] chp: python
[2013-11-14 05:32:50] ato: chp: You can run in xvfb on Linux obviously, or use PhantomJS (which is Chrome-like).
[2013-11-14 05:32:50] chp: chromedriver is the headless chrome, right?
[2013-11-14 05:33:02] chp: PhantomJS is causing the problem
[2013-11-14 05:33:04] p_l: chp: I think you misunderstand what headless typically means
[2013-11-14 05:33:20] chp: i dont want a gui to pop up
[2013-11-14 05:33:23] chp: is that not headless ?
[2013-11-14 05:33:30] p_l: headless doesn't mean no window, headless means the display it uses doesn't have to be displayed somewhere
[2013-11-14 05:34:01] chp: ok so exactly what i said, no gui (display) pop up (displayed somewhere)
[2013-11-14 05:34:03] chp: ;)
[2013-11-14 05:34:08] p_l: for example, Xvfb under linux, disconnected Desktop sessions in windows, etc.
[2013-11-14 05:34:30] p_l: chp: no, the applications pops up its gui, you just "connect" that display anywhere :)
[2013-11-14 05:34:50] chp: so the display has to be put somewhere? it cant just run behind the scene
[2013-11-14 05:34:51] p_l: I used to run test machines under VMware to avoid RDP issues
[2013-11-14 05:35:11] mboman, quitting. (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[2013-11-14 05:35:52] p_l: chp: in order to have proper reproduction of real environment you have to run full GUI etc. You just might not route the display anywhere (like with Xvfb, disconnected RDP sessions, VMware etc.)
[2013-11-14 05:36:04] mboman, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-14 05:36:11] chp: ok thats exactly what i want to do, how can i do that
[2013-11-14 05:36:32] chp: as when i use chromedriver.exe i get a gui pop up, how do i redirect it to no where
[2013-11-14 05:37:20] p_l: chp: you run it under a user session that isn't connected to any display - I recommend Vmware, because disconnected RDP causes problems with screenshot capture
[2013-11-14 05:39:53] chp: thanks for the advice p_l. Are there any other ways as this script will be run on desktops with displays
[2013-11-14 05:40:03] chp: i cant ask them to disable their display ;)
[2013-11-14 05:40:17] SeleniumIE_Prob: hey there
[2013-11-14 05:40:26] p_l: chp: I prefer to isolate the OS instances that run the tests into VMware VMs (can be Virtualbox or whatever)
[2013-11-14 05:40:54] chp: i appreciate your preference but that doesnt work for me ;) are there any other ways other than what you prefer

[2013-11-14 06:42:54] jimevans: they're misnamed. at the time they were introduced, the reason to return VISTA vs XP meant "UAC-enabled" vs. "not UAC-enabled"
[2013-11-14 06:43:10] jimevans: over time, other platforms have been added, but imo, they're of dubious value.
[2013-11-14 06:43:20] jimevans: others, i'm sure, disagree.
[2013-11-14 06:43:42] dimacus: well if i disable UAC out of the box… does it really matter anymore?
[2013-11-14 06:44:20] jimevans: i suppose not, but dear lord, why would you do such a thing? you're fundamentally altering the environment to be entirely unlike that your users will use.
[2013-11-14 06:44:31] jimevans: particularly for IE
[2013-11-14 06:44:51] jimevans: i mean, it runs the process of iexplore.exe in an entirely different way if UAC is disabled.
[2013-11-14 06:45:01] jimevans: s/it/windows/
[2013-11-14 06:45:07] dimacus: whaaa?

[2013-11-14 06:45:48] jimevans: when you disable UAC, you no longer have to elevate. that means that IE can be launched in a process with a medium mandatory integrity level.
[2013-11-14 06:45:57] jimevans: by default, as a user, it launches with a low integrity level.
[2013-11-14 06:46:21] dimacus: wow this is so complicated :(

[2013-11-14 06:46:23] jimevans: processes with a low MIL are severely restricted to the things they can write to.
[2013-11-14 06:46:50] jimevans: and that's exactly why we have a convoluted "you have to set protected mode settings before IE will work"

[2013-11-14 06:52:20] dimacus: yeah people love to give IE hard time security etc… but to be fair the guys were sort of inventing the wheel there in the begining… no one could have anticipated everything that went wrong sinc
[2013-11-14 06:53:05] jimevans: the IE team is, by far, the most hated development team among browser developers. who wants to work in an environment where your every decision is derided by nearly everyone? my heart goes out to them.
[2013-11-14 06:53:44] dimacus: yeah the cry themselves all the way to the bank
[2013-11-14 06:54:04] jimevans: um, for a long time, MSFT didn't pay all that well
[2013-11-14 06:54:07] dimacus: if you are working for that team and expect to be hated… you probably deserve a higher pay rate
[2013-11-14 06:54:33] dimacus: that's brilliant… here is a team that is the core of your product… let's not pay them at all
[2013-11-14 06:55:18] jimevans: i admit, it's been nearly 10 years since i worked for MSFT, but it was only the last few that they updated the compensation package. particularly since stock options aren't doing it anymore.
[2013-11-14 06:55:52] jimevans: s/last few/last few years i did work there/

[2013-11-14 07:34:34] jimevans: ato: in your bug about executing script, how do you mean that "array is languauge specific"?
[2013-11-14 07:34:38] thrustcore: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0b7e6de1ac1156903a27 what... what is happening?
[2013-11-14 07:35:06] ato: jimevans: IIRC some languages don't have a concept of arrays.
[2013-11-14 07:35:25] ato: So the thinking was that “list” would be less implementation specific.
[2013-11-14 07:35:54] Dude-X_: AutomatedTester: http://pythonwheels.com/ we should get Selenium packaged as a wheel too
[2013-11-14 07:35:58] jimevans: i rather thought that array was more common than "list"
[2013-11-14 07:36:02] ato: But it's just about wording really.  I think we use list in some places, and array in others.
[2013-11-14 07:37:31] jimevans: i guess i'm not seeing where in the spec there would be confusion about that though. i read the section talking about the result as "array" means "JavaScript array".

[2013-11-14 07:40:36] AutomatedTester_, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-14 07:40:37] ato: jimevans: IIRC JavaScript has array literals and Array's.
[2013-11-14 07:41:02] ato: Which if you try to unmarshal them naïvely look different.
[2013-11-14 07:41:19] ato: ["foo", "bar"] vs {1:"foo", 2:"bar"}.
[2013-11-14 07:41:31] *ato could be wrong though'

[2013-11-14 07:41:49] jimevans: true enough. but what does JSON.stringify do for var foo=[] vs var foo=new Array() ?

[2013-11-14 07:43:03] jimevans: :)
[2013-11-14 07:43:29] ato: But yeah, that first point was as I said mainly about consistency as I thought we had discussed array vs list before.

[2013-11-14 07:45:52] ato: jimevans: Seems array is preferable, but the tendency is to use SomethingList when you make a fancy implementation on top.
[2013-11-14 07:45:55] jimevans: chp: it depends on what you're doing, what browser you're using, and what the structure of your HTML is.

[2013-11-14 07:47:08] jimevans: chp: it's a global setting. but there's nothing stopping you from setting it, then setting it back once you're done.

[2013-11-14 07:56:18] chp: i figured that would be more painful than selenium
[2013-11-14 07:56:23] cgoldberg: chp, http libraries don't execute javascript at all... but you can craft the request it sends
[2013-11-14 07:56:48] chp: aah, yes the reqs are complex
[2013-11-14 07:56:57] cgoldberg: all you need to do is sniff the http during a user workflow... and see what's in the requests
[2013-11-14 07:57:00] chp: there is a point when clicking on the users name the URL contains a specific ID

[2013-11-14 08:02:47] jimevans: i mean, i really don't know the architecture of the app, beyond about 10 minutes of googling, but that might be your best option (if displaying a browser is really a problem)
[2013-11-14 08:03:06] jimevans: dimacus: don't. just don't. :)
[2013-11-14 08:03:23] thrustcore: so how exactly do expected conditions work? Is it a boolean function?
[2013-11-14 08:03:36] dimacus: i give advice… no say good advice
[2013-11-14 08:04:01] chp: unfortuantely displaying the browser is the problem
[2013-11-14 08:04:21] chp: dimacus id laugh at that if i wasnt living this nightmare ;)
[2013-11-14 08:04:47] jimevans: thrustcore: so an expected condition is usually returns a lambda expression, which is executed by the webdriverwait class. implementation may be slightly different, based on the semantics of the langauge in question
[2013-11-14 08:05:20] dimacus: chp:  sorry my friend :( laughing at self is the only thing that prevents tears from flowing

[2013-11-14 08:10:14] jimevans: oh. i think i see what you're having challenges with.
[2013-11-14 08:10:18] thrustcore: well in pseudocode, I want this: while (can't find target element) { press_next_arrow() } -- but my while statement doesn't work with (while not (EC.elment_to_be_clickable))
[2013-11-14 08:10:33] AutomatedTester_, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-11-14 08:10:43] jimevans: the expected conditions aren't methods to be called just to return a boolean value.

[2013-11-14 08:29:08] Dude-X_: thrustcore: best thing to do is wrap the webdriver api

[2013-11-14 08:30:02] jimevans: thrustcore: so i see a potential issue with your pseudocode.
[2013-11-14 08:30:13] jimevans: let me see if i've got it correct.
[2013-11-14 08:30:19] thrustcore: ok :/
[2013-11-14 08:30:39] jimevans: you're looking for an element, and if you don't see it on the page, you click another element (presumably to go to the next page or some such)
[2013-11-14 08:30:41] jimevans: right?
[2013-11-14 08:30:53] jimevans: or that's what you want, anyway
[2013-11-14 08:32:18] thrustcore: yes exactly
[2013-11-14 08:33:16] jimevans: okay. here's the potential problem: how do you distinguish between the case where the element is legitimately not on the page, and the case where the browser hasn't rendered it yet?
[2013-11-14 08:33:30] jimevans: if that's not a problem in your case, then we can move on from there.

[2013-11-14 08:41:36] thrustcore: jimevans: it shouldn't be a problem, it seems to work now
[2013-11-14 08:42:13] jimevans: fine, just be aware that you may run into problems down the road, particularly with different browsers (IE?) that are slower to interpret/render the DOM.
[2013-11-14 08:42:15] thrustcore: now I'm just having a problem because find_element_by_xpath should find 3 elements, and I want the first one and WebElement doesn't allow indexing, can I specify that I want the first one in the xpath selector? do I just add a [1] ?
[2013-11-14 08:42:22] chp: any other work around to send_keys ?
[2013-11-14 08:42:32] chp: driver.execute_script("arguments[0].value = arguments[1]", driver.find_element_by_name("pwdPwdPassword"), "112233")  im using that
[2013-11-14 08:42:35] chp: not working :(
[2013-11-14 08:42:42] thrustcore: jimevans: I'm not worried about that, the whole reason I'm not using selenium IDE is because I'm testing a system that doesn't support ff
[2013-11-14 08:43:28] jimevans: thrustcore: you could do that with the xpath selector. or you could do find_elements_by_xpath, and index into the collection returned. (note the 's')
[2013-11-14 08:44:11] thrustcore: element = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(xpath)[index].click()	?
[2013-11-14 08:44:21] thrustcore: oh lol wait, either element = or .click
[2013-11-14 08:44:25] thrustcore: but the middle part is right, right?
[2013-11-14 08:45:09] chp: thrustcore is that for me
[2013-11-14 08:45:14] jimevans: should do, assuming python's collection indexer is [ ]. and i think they're zero-based.
[2013-11-14 08:45:37] lukeis: it is and it is
[2013-11-14 08:47:10] jimevans: chp: you probably need to quote the value in the script. driver.execute_script("arguments[0].value = 'arguments[1]'", driver.find_element_by_name("pwdPwdPassword"), "112233").
[2013-11-14 08:47:24] lukeis: no you don't
[2013-11-14 08:47:44] jimevans: though why you don't do driver.execute_script("arguments[0].value = '112233'", driver.find_element_by_name("pwdPwdPassword")) is beyond me.
[2013-11-14 08:47:49] lukeis: that will set the text value to "arguemnts[1]" ;)
[2013-11-14 08:48:15] jimevans: ah right. so it will
[2013-11-14 08:48:19] jimevans: i'm an idiot.

[2013-11-14 08:48:25] jimevans: don't listen to me.
[2013-11-14 08:48:30] chp: noted
[2013-11-14 08:48:42] lukeis: the arguments[1] approach helps to escape "  and '   easier for you
[2013-11-14 08:48:43] chp: could it be that im not storing my driver.findelementbyblabla into a variable

[2013-11-14 08:49:01] chp: lukeis example?

[2013-11-14 08:49:26] chp: driver.find_element_by_id("pwdPwdPassword").clear()
[2013-11-14 08:49:40] chp: driver.execute_script("arguments[0].value = arguments[1]", driver.find_element_by_name("pwdPwdPassword"), "112233")
[2013-11-14 08:49:58] chp: err, copied that wrong as it doesnt jump between name and id
[2013-11-14 08:50:04] chp: but just replace name with id in the first line
[2013-11-14 08:50:09] chp: should i store the first into a variable?
[2013-11-14 08:50:22] chp: askldjaksd  = driver.find_element_by_id("pwdPwdPassword")
[2013-11-14 08:50:27] chp: askldjaksd.clear()
[2013-11-14 08:50:34] Dude-X_: that works
[2013-11-14 08:50:43] lukeis: instead of needing to do this:   "args[0].value = 'it\\\'s my \"Quote\"'"    you can do  "args[0].value = args[1]",  "it's " + 'my "Quoate"'   :)
[2013-11-14 08:50:43] chp: is it better than typing it all out?
[2013-11-14 08:50:43] jimevans: chp: i would. save you from having to do another lookup of the element.
[2013-11-14 08:51:03] chp: ok let me try that
[2013-11-14 08:51:28] jimevans: not that it'll make any difference, but it's just more efficient.
[2013-11-14 08:51:35] chp: ok thats what i thought
[2013-11-14 08:51:38] chp: then mv
[2013-11-14 08:52:01] chp: lukeis do you think that will have any affect on trying to type into this box? maybe i should try sending keys thru a diff module than selenium
[2013-11-14 08:52:08] chp: click the box then send keys another method
[2013-11-14 08:52:33] *lukeis missing context of what's wrong'
[2013-11-14 08:52:38] lukeis: send keys not working?
[2013-11-14 08:52:38] jimevans: chp: i don't know what other module you'd expect to use with phantomjs.
[2013-11-14 08:52:48] lukeis: oh yeah, phantom issue
[2013-11-14 08:53:01] chp: the root issue is that send_keys doesnt put the keys in the box
[2013-11-14 08:53:01] lukeis: executing script and setting value doesn't work?
[2013-11-14 08:53:24] chp: lukeis i am a noob, can you provide example

[2013-11-14 11:10:52] D-Spair_: I just figured out what I was doing wrong... I should have just had Selenium IDE generate a Remote Control test for me...
[2013-11-14 11:11:36] cgoldberg: D-Spair_, you should forget IDE and RC.. Webdriver is the way :)
[2013-11-14 11:12:10] D-Spair_: I wrote all of my tests using WebDriver, but I want to run the tests from the Continuous Integration server and it does not have a GUI...

[2013-11-14 11:15:42] *jimevans wishes people would use the phrase "throws an exception" instead of "crashes"'
[2013-11-14 11:15:46] D-Spair_: The server spit out an Exception about the path to Chrome not being set.
[2013-11-14 11:16:05] D-Spair_: The test failed, the server spat out an exception.
[2013-11-14 11:16:25] jimevans: D-Spair_: right. use DesiredCapabilities.firefox() instead of .chrome()
[2013-11-14 11:17:00] D-Spair_: The test is just stuck... The remote server is NOT launching firefox..

[2013-11-14 11:18:14] jimevans: not surprising. it had to create a new anonymous firefox profile from scratch and install a browser extension into the profile.
[2013-11-14 11:18:41] D-Spair_: Can the WebDriver remote server just keep Firefox running so that the startup and shutdown don't take so long?
[2013-11-14 11:19:26] jimevans: not really. you'd need to write your tests in such a way that each test doesn't need to restart the browser.
[2013-11-14 11:19:26] D-Spair_: Or can I get it to save that profile so that Firefox launches much quicker?
[2013-11-14 11:20:10] jimevans: even if you did save the profile, the driver creates a copy. (consider the case where two instances of the firefox driver want to launch two different instances of firefox, both using the same profile)

[2013-11-14 12:17:56] chp: i just locate the element before the text box and send the TAB key, then locate the textbox and send my keys

[2013-11-14 12:23:23] chp: nothing goes into the box
[2013-11-14 12:23:42] chp: but now if i find the element above the box and send a tab, then find my element and send_keys
[2013-11-14 12:23:44] chp: i get chars in the box
[2013-11-14 12:24:04] chp: the confirm password box doesnt have this issue

[2013-11-14 12:24:07] chp: <input type="password" onkeyup="ValidateConfirm()" id="pwdPwdConfirm" name="pwdPwdConfirm" size="15" maxlength="15">
[2013-11-14 12:24:23] smccarthy: chp: I've had cases where I have to click the text field, wait for it to change, than start typing
[2013-11-14 12:24:54] chp: tbf, i dont give a shit how i get the data in there as long as i can :D
[2013-11-14 12:25:04] dimacus: chp:  actually yes, that's what i started to do also, anytime there is sendKeys i do a click on element first
[2013-11-14 12:25:18] chp: i tried clicking first
[2013-11-14 12:25:28] dimacus: that didn't work either?
[2013-11-14 12:25:31] chp: myelement.click(); myelement.send_keys(2323)
[2013-11-14 12:25:33] chp: didnt work
[2013-11-14 12:25:42] chp: daemon fyi this is python
[2013-11-14 12:25:59] daemon: a
[2013-11-14 12:26:00] daemon: h
[2013-11-14 12:26:03] daemon: im using perl
[2013-11-14 12:27:08] dimacus: chp:  can you send a JS event unto element directly?
[2013-11-14 12:27:28] chp: could you give me an example?
[2013-11-14 12:27:37] chp: sry, im a network engineer playing python dev ;)
[2013-11-14 12:27:38] dimacus: try to set element value without using the atoms… that is SE1 way
[2013-11-14 12:27:57] dimacus: python should have some method called "evaluate_script" or equivelent
[2013-11-14 12:28:10] lukeis: dimacus: we've been through this ;) there's a problem with send_keys on the element with phantomjs
[2013-11-14 12:28:10] dimacus: look for that that lets you send a JS command directly to browsers
[2013-11-14 12:28:18] dimacus: ohhh
[2013-11-14 12:28:28] chp: lukeis knows my deal
[2013-11-14 12:28:35] dimacus: nm then i'm out of ideas
[2013-11-14 12:28:36] *lukeis still waiting for a sample page to actually troubleshoot ;)'
[2013-11-14 12:28:48] *chp smothers lukeis with a pilloww'
[2013-11-14 12:28:49] chp: sssh!
[2013-11-14 12:28:50] chp: :D
[2013-11-14 12:29:05] chp: lukeis i at least have a work around
[2013-11-14 12:29:15] lukeis: well that's good at least :)
[2013-11-14 12:29:16] chp: idk if you saw but sending a tab key to the element before works
[2013-11-14 12:29:49] lukeis: cool… sounds like the page does have some tricky javascript related to that element in particular then

[2013-11-14 15:41:52] lukeis: which is valid :)
[2013-11-14 15:41:53] jimevans1: but what do i know
[2013-11-14 15:42:23] lukeis: still doesn't mean (in my mind) we can't have a CI job reminding us how broken it is :)
[2013-11-14 15:43:09] jimevans1: i wouldn't care, if it was our fault it's broken.
[2013-11-14 15:43:31] jimevans1: like, we just didn't look at it, or had something that we just hadn't worked around yet.
[2013-11-14 15:43:42] jimevans1: but this is MSFT actually introducing code that breaks the driver.
[2013-11-14 15:43:45] lukeis: heh, "our fault" (most of the previous firefox releases weren't 'our fault' either)
[2013-11-14 15:43:51] jimevans1: (not intentionally, but still)_
[2013-11-14 15:44:51] lukeis: and here I thought MS was using the IE Driver to test their stuff ;)  (bing for example I heard was)
[2013-11-14 15:45:53] santiycr: lukeis:  we'll be nice as in if you ask for IE11 and no OS, we'll figure the OS out for you
[2013-11-14 15:46:02] lukeis: thankfully (unlike Chrome 31)  IE 11  has a very small market share ;)
[2013-11-14 15:46:07] santiycr: we don't transparently replace it, as that is most likely not what you want
[2013-11-14 15:46:12] jayunit: can anyone help with a Python webdriver question?  I think I'm confused about either desired_capabilities, loggingPrefs, or the profiler-level logging stuff in particular

[2013-11-14 15:49:04] lukeis: santiycr: your browser page says "Windows 8" and "Windows 8.1" should be passed… but selenium Java passes "WIN8" and it works, do I need to pass "WIN8.1" ?
[2013-11-14 15:51:18] santiycr: lukeis:  not for me
[2013-11-14 15:51:19] santiycr: WebDriverException: Message: "Unsupported OS/browser/version combo: OS: 'Windows 2012', Browser: 'iexplore', Version: '11.'"
[2013-11-14 15:51:50] lukeis: you passed in 2012?

[2013-11-14 15:52:05] lukeis: oh, that's what it defaults to
[2013-11-14 15:52:09] santiycr: when you pass WIN8, sauce automatically stores Windows 2012
[2013-11-14 15:52:25] santiycr: and "Windows 2012" isn't valid
[2013-11-14 15:52:31] santiycr: what's valid is "Windows 2012 R2"
[2013-11-14 15:53:09] lukeis: do you want to patch Platform.java ? :)
[2013-11-14 15:54:26] santiycr: well, there clearly needs to be a new platform
[2013-11-14 15:54:33] lukeis: santiycr: that doesn't look right… i think the raw json that it would send is "WIN8"
[2013-11-14 15:54:44] santiycr: the fact that microsoft decided to name it 8.1 doesn't mean that it can be considered the same
[2013-11-14 15:54:53] santiycr: otherwise, you'd be able to upgrade without paying them :)

[2013-11-14 15:55:56] lukeis: i really dislike windows 8.*
[2013-11-14 15:59:09] santiycr: tell me about it
[2013-11-14 15:59:35] santiycr: dealing with configuring and getting it all reasonable for users' test to run on it
[2013-11-14 16:00:57] jimevans1: santiycr: if you're not already doing so, you'll need to turn Enhanced Protected Mode off.
[2013-11-14 16:01:16] jimevans1: that'll be a requirement for the IE driver with IE11
[2013-11-14 16:01:29] santiycr: we turn all the things off
[2013-11-14 16:01:45] santiycr: jimevans1:  IE driver is already running on Sauce, BTW
[2013-11-14 16:01:47] santiycr: with IE11
[2013-11-14 16:01:54] jimevans1: it'll break
[2013-11-14 16:01:59] jimevans1: guaranteed.
[2013-11-14 16:02:12] santiycr: well I assume that's just IE, isn't it?
[2013-11-14 16:02:14] jimevans1: someone, somewhere will find it not working
[2013-11-14 16:02:15] santiycr: :P
[2013-11-14 16:02:23] phasze: challenge accepted
[2013-11-14 16:02:30] santiycr: jimevans1:  that's why you guys should put it on CI
[2013-11-14 16:02:36] santiycr: so we at least know what's not working
[2013-11-14 16:02:45] santiycr: I guess I can put it easily
[2013-11-14 16:02:50] santiycr: or lukeis already is
[2013-11-14 16:02:56] jimevans1: santiycr: i'm telling you it's not "features" that are broken.
[2013-11-14 16:03:08] jimevans1: why does no one listen to me on this.
[2013-11-14 16:03:29] lukeis: what did you say jim? ;)
[2013-11-14 16:03:29] jimevans1: it's not like "sending keys is broken" or "switching frames is broken"
[2013-11-14 16:03:47] *lukeis expects 99% test failure'
[2013-11-14 16:03:57] jimevans1: when you get a protected mode boundary crossed, you're done.

[2013-11-14 16:04:22] jimevans1: #6511
[2013-11-14 16:04:23] selbot2: 03---- open/Accepted IE11 exceptions with IEDriverServer: Unable to get browser - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=6511 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Browser-IE ]
[2013-11-14 16:04:32] jimevans1: ^^ that's the symptom you'll see
[2013-11-14 16:04:50] jimevans1: i can reproduce it on my machine. every. single. time. i run the selenium test suite.
[2013-11-14 16:04:50] santiycr: interesting
[2013-11-14 16:04:55] jimevans1: i know exactly what causes it
[2013-11-14 16:05:15] jimevans1: and i don't know how to disable the setting that causes it
[2013-11-14 16:05:23] jimevans1: (neither does anyone at MSFT, btw)
[2013-11-14 16:05:44] santiycr: you're saying it's not a feature that fails
[2013-11-14 16:05:47] jimevans1: i'm working with them on the issue, but until they can tell me how to disable BFCache, we're done
[2013-11-14 16:05:56] santiycr: but at the same time you say you reproduce this reliably
[2013-11-14 16:05:56] jimevans1: yes, that's exactly what i'm saying
[2013-11-14 16:06:09] jimevans1: yes, anytime a protected mode boundary is crossed.
[2013-11-14 16:06:16] santiycr: when does that happen
[2013-11-14 16:06:17] santiycr: ?
[2013-11-14 16:06:30] jimevans1: i happen to know which test(s) in the webdriver test suite will trigger that condition.
[2013-11-14 16:06:57] jimevans1: but if you go from, say, http://localhost to http://127.0.0.1, you'll hit the problem
[2013-11-14 16:07:10] santiycr: oh, it's not the actions that do it, but the workflow of the test
[2013-11-14 16:07:11] jimevans1: you don't even need to run webdriver to see it happening.
[2013-11-14 16:07:26] santiycr: oh well, I call that a browser error
[2013-11-14 16:07:44] santiycr: "it sucks, deal with it" kind of thing
[2013-11-14 16:07:52] jimevans1: https://gist.github.com/jimevans/7268760 is a console app that will show the OnQuit event firing unexpectedly
[2013-11-14 16:08:04] jimevans1: the problem is that you, the user, have no control over it.
[2013-11-14 16:08:06] jimevans1: full stop.
[2013-11-14 16:08:15] santiycr: lol
[2013-11-14 16:08:24] jimevans1: so "dealing with it" is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible.
[2013-11-14 16:12:03] jimevans1: right. gotta go. i'll likely be offline for 2 weeks. do try to get along without me.
