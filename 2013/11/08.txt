[2013-11-08 06:47:26] HolyGoat: say I have Selenium act as a grid, and have a few nodes in them; but at some point I want my test to be executed on a specific node in the grid. Is this possible at all? Or does it just completely defeat the purpose of using a grid, and I should call the node directly instead?
[2013-11-08 06:49:58] Dave_B_: ~ bit of both. Are your nodes intended as exact duplicates of each other?
[2013-11-08 06:50:38] Dave_B_: e.g. if you only test on latest firefox & chrome you've then gort the freedom to abuse the version and make it be a 'wehih node' ... you don't have to use it, but if you feel the need you can
[2013-11-08 06:50:52] Dave_B_: wehih -> which
[2013-11-08 06:50:57] Dave_B_: gort -> got
[2013-11-08 06:51:03] Dave_B_: typing -> fail :(
[2013-11-08 06:51:05] HolyGoat: Dave_B_: Yes, but they're in different locations, and in some cases I want to run a check on a node in a specific location/data center (I'm using Selenium for monitoring)
[2013-11-08 06:51:56] hirani, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-08 06:52:00] Dave_B_: if you're not currently usaing the platform and/or version numbers in your capability matching then you can certainly do that, though if you're only ever doing it this way then you probably don't need a grid
[2013-11-08 06:52:29] HolyGoat: Ah right, abusing the version is a hack that could work in my case, thanks!
[2013-11-08 06:52:52] HolyGoat: All nodes are (supposed to be) exactly the same, I don't differ based on versions
[2013-11-08 06:53:01] Dave_B_: :p yep, sorry I tend to always go for hacks as a fast way of getting where I want, then forget to go back and do it properly!
[2013-11-08 06:53:15] HolyGoat: It makes me think. Maybe I need a grid as well as direct access to the nodes, so I can do two types of checks
[2013-11-08 06:53:24] HolyGoat: Sounds familiar :)
[2013-11-08 06:53:40] Dave_B_: In that case you've got the same as my grid, my nodes are all the same, version just gives me specific node access for when i need it (in my case only for debugging)
[2013-11-08 06:54:10] *Dave_B_ hopes any of the people who are actually good at this stuff arn't lsitening :p'
[2013-11-08 06:54:12] HolyGoat: I'm porting my Nagios <-> Selenium Python library to Webdriver currently, I'm sure I'll need some more hacking :)
[2013-11-08 06:55:16] Dave_B_: :) I'm sure you will! It's quite fun/theraputic sometimes to just hack past a problem rather than solve it 'properly' (and really irritating & frustrating others!)
[2013-11-08 06:56:24] HolyGoat: Well it would be great if we could register a custom/arbitrary capability when registering a node, so one can select on that specifically. But I'm not sure if it's in line with the philosophy behind using a grid (because I guess using a grid means "node agnostic")
[2013-11-08 06:57:28] HolyGoat: My current version of the project is here: https://github.com/objectified/seymour ; beware, hacks ahead :)

[2013-11-08 07:06:59] HolyGoat: ah I see. No I'm not using Django for this, it's just Python with the Selenium bindings for Python

[2013-11-08 09:22:08] brockfredin: thrustcore I'm like 90.01 percent sure.  So, my confidence beats yours.
[2013-11-08 09:22:25] jimevans: brockfredin: what dialog handling do you think you need? also, there are other projects that would be better suited to dialog handling.
[2013-11-08 09:23:22] brockfredin: Wherever I go, everyone always complains they can't handle upload boxes in Firefox, IE, and even Chrome using Selenium.  Always some tricky work around when uploading documents/etc.

[2013-11-08 09:25:14] jimevans: it's when idiot developers try to get fancy because they don't think the standard html input types will do the right thing that there are issues.
[2013-11-08 09:25:41] jimevans: brockfredin: i think a better approach would be to find out what features they think the standard html inputs are lacking.

[2013-11-08 09:27:07] jimevans: i personally haven't come across a use-case that doesn't amount to "but i just want to use another widget because i think the html one is ugly and i don't know enough about css to style it in a way i like"

[2013-11-08 12:11:50] jimevans: might be marginally more performant than a findElement call.

[2013-11-08 12:12:45] lukeis: don't forget the extra cast you need… because java.     WebElement parent = (WebElement) ((JavascriptExecutor……
[2013-11-08 12:13:35] lukeis: i'd guess nominally the same… the execute script atom is just as big ;)
[2013-11-08 12:13:49] jimevans: you're assuming the driver uses the executeScript atom. :)
[2013-11-08 12:14:01] lukeis: which one doesn't? :)
[2013-11-08 12:14:05] jimevans: IE, for one.

[2013-11-08 12:15:19] jimevans: yep. mostly because we don't use the injected atoms' caching of elements.

[2013-11-08 12:48:47] jimevans: jleyba: so i've fixed the mouseover/mouseout behavior for that test case in IE.
[2013-11-08 12:48:50] jimevans: except for IE8
[2013-11-08 12:50:03] jimevans: not entirely sure why, but moving to element.getSize().getWidth() + 1 (or .getHeight() + 1) doesn't move outside the bounds of the element on IE8
[2013-11-08 12:50:24] jimevans: i'm guessing it has to do with borders not being taken into account, but damned if i know.

[2013-11-08 14:27:44] miebster_atwork: I'm a little baffled why it never waits for anything to load, I've never had good luck, basically every other line in my script is "wait for this to exist" I feel like im doing something wrong
[2013-11-08 14:29:10] miebster_atwork: lukeis how can I just wait for the title to exist, and then retrieve it?
[2013-11-08 14:29:26] lukeis: title always exists
[2013-11-08 14:30:04] miebster_atwork: then how come browser.title returns empty?
[2013-11-08 14:30:12] lukeis: cause the page had no title ;)
[2013-11-08 14:30:37] lukeis: i should say an empty title
[2013-11-08 14:30:58] miebster_atwork: lukeis: if the first page has a non empty title, and the second page has a non empty title, how could browser.title return empty?
[2013-11-08 14:31:20] lukeis: not sure
[2013-11-08 14:31:46] lukeis: it shouldn't or the page is in the middle of loading?

[2013-11-08 14:32:26] lukeis: titile is not a great way to detect your page is loaded though
[2013-11-08 14:33:03] lukeis: you should look for an element to become interactable (EC.element_to_be_clickable )
[2013-11-08 14:33:23] jimevans: this is where the naive user says, "but selenium rc had a waitforpagetoload method. why doesn't webdriver have something like that?"
[2013-11-08 14:33:40] lukeis: because I said so
[2013-11-08 14:33:42] *jimevans is trolling'

[2013-11-08 14:34:20] jimevans: meh, i'm distinctly unimpressed with 'gods' :)
[2013-11-08 14:34:36] miebster_atwork: this is just really frustrating, so I have to wait for some other element to be on the page, and then check the title?
[2013-11-08 14:34:43] jimevans: particularly those i've had beer with.
[2013-11-08 14:34:51] miebster_atwork: Seems really really odd that there is no way to say "wait for the page source to be done downloading?"
[2013-11-08 14:35:03] jimevans: miebster_atwork: let's get socratic for a moment.
[2013-11-08 14:35:04] lukeis: miebster_atwork: what's wrong with using EC.title_is ?

[2013-11-08 14:35:25] miebster_atwork: lukeis: what if I don't know what the title is? and I just want to print it, you know, so I know what it is for next time
[2013-11-08 14:35:29] jimevans: what are you *really* waiting for? what constitutes being able to do the next thing you want to do?

[2013-11-08 14:35:56] miebster_atwork: jimevans: what I really want to do is say "make sure when I click this link, the page that is loaded next is the correct page"
[2013-11-08 14:36:34] miebster_atwork: so, I have the elemnt right, so I go element.click()  what should the next line be?
[2013-11-08 14:36:43] lukeis: EC.staleness_of(that_element_you_clicked);   follwed by EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.id, "link I want to click on the next page"));
[2013-11-08 14:36:43] jimevans: okay. how do you know what the "correct page" is? (if it's title, and you don't know that a priori, you've got a flaw in your logic)
[2013-11-08 14:37:44] miebster_atwork: jimevans: the first time I run the test I expect it to fail and say "Assertion failed, 'placehlder title' does not equal  'complicated title with unicode chacaters that are hard to figure out how to write in code'
[2013-11-08 14:38:05] miebster_atwork: I will then copy and paste that complicated title, and put it into the assert
[2013-11-08 14:38:25] lukeis: wait.until(lambda d: len(d.title) > 0)
[2013-11-08 14:38:31] miebster_atwork: saying EC.titleis is very different from getting the title, and putting it into an assert statement,
[2013-11-08 14:38:47] miebster_atwork: for example, EC.titleis will skip any sort of logging and printing I have built into my assertion method
[2013-11-08 14:39:33] lukeis: or d.title != previous_title and len(d.title) > 0
[2013-11-08 14:39:37] jimevans: miebster_atwork: there you go.
