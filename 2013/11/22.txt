[2013-11-22 00:01:28] robinsmidsrod: does anyone know why opera doesn't default to english (http accept-language) when using the the standalone server with webdriver api?

[2013-11-22 00:02:40] robinsmidsrod: I assume you might know, as I just read an article by you on the opera webdriver

[2013-11-22 03:09:59] ato: robinsmidsrod: Perhaps your remote end has a different locale set?  It's my only guess.
[2013-11-22 03:10:49] robinsmidsrod: ato: so opera tries to use the locale of the OS to figure out how to set the accept-language?
[2013-11-22 03:11:04] robinsmidsrod: if it is completely undefined...
[2013-11-22 03:11:32] ato: I'm guessing.  operadriver certainly doesn't have anything to do with it.
[2013-11-22 03:11:57] robinsmidsrod: ato: indeed, I'm just trying to get consistent results among browsers
[2013-11-22 03:12:20] robinsmidsrod: firefox, chrome and safari all defaulted to english, while ie and opera defaulted to Norwegian
[2013-11-22 03:12:48] diancho, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-22 03:13:00] ato: My best suggestion is to open up the profile/preferences and see what goes on there.
[2013-11-22 03:13:07] robinsmidsrod: in IE's case I just had to remove accept-language config in the browser, but for opera that didn't make any difference
[2013-11-22 03:13:30] ato: Possibly you can tweak it through opera:prefs, which has an API through driver.preferences().set("foo", "bar").
[2013-11-22 03:14:06] robinsmidsrod: ato: it does, but I can't seem to understand how to call that when I use standalone server called from Perl (Selenium::Remote::Driver)
[2013-11-22 03:14:31] ato: Ah, well it's only exposed on Java.
[2013-11-22 03:14:47] robinsmidsrod: not available via the remote api?
[2013-11-22 03:14:49] ato: It's missing the command primitives to do it via the wire protocol.
[2013-11-22 03:15:08] robinsmidsrod: ato: so is that something that is on a todo list?
[2013-11-22 03:15:29] ato: Yes, probably.  But I don't work for Opera anymore (-:
[2013-11-22 03:15:42] robinsmidsrod: ato: ooh :)
[2013-11-22 03:16:00] robinsmidsrod: got any idea where I can submit a bug report on getting user preference possible via remote?
[2013-11-22 03:16:54] ato: You can try the issue tracker on github but I wouldn't hold my hopes high.  Opera recently backed out of the webdriver standardization process, and have announced they're abandoning Presto-based Opera early next year.
[2013-11-22 03:18:08] robinsmidsrod: so I guess at that point I shouldn't really bother to test opera at all? :)
[2013-11-22 03:19:08] ato: My point of view is that you should ask yourself if not testing Chromium (which all new Operas are based on) will be sufficient.
[2013-11-22 03:19:37] robinsmidsrod: ato: I'm already testing with standard Chrome, so that might possibly be GoodEnough(TM)
[2013-11-22 03:20:29] robinsmidsrod: I solved my immediate problem by specifying an explicit opera.profile which I customized accordingly
[2013-11-22 03:20:30] ato: Yeah.  Believe me when I say there's no substantial difference between Chrome beta/dev channels and Opera final's.
[2013-11-22 03:21:01] ato: You could possibly tweak the profile manually and try to send that across as a capability.
[2013-11-22 03:21:31] robinsmidsrod: already ended up doing that - just wanted to try and avoid that, as it requires more setup on the test client machine
[2013-11-22 03:21:34] ato: Tweaking the profile is what the operadriver does for you on the remote end if you do it before the start of the browser.  While it's running it uses Scope to chage prefs.
[2013-11-22 03:22:13] *AutomatedTester hopes Opera will join us again'
[2013-11-22 03:22:40] ato: Excuse me for a moment.
[2013-11-22 03:22:42] ato: HAHAH.
[2013-11-22 03:22:57] robinsmidsrod: also, the Selenium::Remote::Driver code seems to work well when using Perl
[2013-11-22 03:23:07] robinsmidsrod: +1 from me
[2013-11-22 03:23:21] ato: Yup, the wire protocol is wonderful (-:
