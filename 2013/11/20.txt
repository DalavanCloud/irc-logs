[2013-11-20 02:20:22] raj_: I need a help in selenium webdirver.. can someone please help me with this
[2013-11-20 02:23:38] AdamDangoor: Raj_: Hi Raj. What do you need in particular?
[2013-11-20 02:24:45] raj_: hhi Adam, I am using selenium sendkeys to enter text in text box for a web application in IE browser
[2013-11-20 02:25:14] AdamDangoor: Raj_: Ok
[2013-11-20 02:25:22] PavanGupta01, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-20 02:26:27] PavanGupta01, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2013-11-20 02:26:48] raj_: i use a separate method for sending the keys to the webpage...if i call the method, first time it's entering all the data ...after few other code execution, once again if i call the same method it enters the text in web page but it's not visible..so the code execution fails
[2013-11-20 02:29:05] AdamDangoor: Raj_: Are you watching IE? How do you know that it is not visible? If it is not visible, how do you know that the text is entered?
[2013-11-20 02:31:00] raj_: i can see the cursor switching to next field one by one and finally it clicks the submit button.. Since we dont have any text in textbox it gets failed there
[2013-11-20 02:31:08] raj_: I dont see any exception as well

[2013-11-20 02:33:42] AdamDangoor: Is this the same set of text fields that the method first gets called on?
[2013-11-20 02:34:04] raj_: yes

[2013-11-20 02:35:01] tizki, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-20 02:35:44] raj_: actually this web application opens multiple windows.. I will be entering a plan detail in one of the window form and submit it...first time it's working fine...soon after sometime i will be adding a new plan once again in the same window form.. this time it fails
[2013-11-20 02:41:29] AdamDangoor: Raj_: Let's ignore the first run of the function for now - it could be sending us off track. Do you have a debugger? If so, could you stop it after one of the fields is clicked into?
[2013-11-20 02:44:11] raj_: i am using java and use eclipse SDK.. I can debug
[2013-11-20 02:48:37] AdamDangoor: Raj_: Bear with me because I don't have experience of Eclipse. If you stop after a field is clicked (1) what happens if you do sendKeys, (2) what happens if you send keys to an element you specify with a locator?
[2013-11-20 02:51:46] raj_: sure Adam...it's running successfully without any exceptions..it's locating the textbox, it's sending the keys but it was not visible in windows form...

[2013-11-20 07:40:41] robinsmidsrod: I'm having problems running selenium with IE, is there a known issue with IE11?
[2013-11-20 07:40:44] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-20 07:41:01] robinsmidsrod: I get a message about blocked content and a broken script that throws an error
[2013-11-20 07:42:32] KaibutsuX: but no issues in IE 9 or 10?
[2013-11-20 07:43:58] robinsmidsrod: KaibutsuX: I haven't got a version of 9 or 10 around to test with
[2013-11-20 07:44:22] KaibutsuX: I'm assuming you don't get the broken script when you manually go to the page?
[2013-11-20 07:44:37] KaibutsuX: and you have set up all the security settings for webdriver/IE?
[2013-11-20 07:44:44] robinsmidsrod: nope, it's something related to the selenium/webdriver scripts

[2013-11-20 07:48:50] KaibutsuX: yeah that looks like an internal selenium issue
[2013-11-20 07:49:00] KaibutsuX: I can't really offer anything more as I don't do a lot with IE
[2013-11-20 07:49:28] robinsmidsrod: KaibutsuX: I also have an issue with safari for windows, but I think that's not supported by apple anymore, right?
[2013-11-20 07:49:41] KaibutsuX: yeah I'm pretty sure that's deprecated
[2013-11-20 07:49:43] robinsmidsrod: and when I specify '*chrome' it opens up firefox instead of chrome

[2013-11-20 07:55:06] KaibutsuX: thats weird, but I'm not that familiar with the RC, I only use it occasionally for opera
[2013-11-20 07:55:39] robinsmidsrod: KaibutsuX: how do you use selenium?
[2013-11-20 07:55:54] KaibutsuX: python bindings with the webdriver source
[2013-11-20 07:56:34] dimacus, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-11-20 07:56:58] AutomatedTester: robinsmidsrod: because that fires up a special thing in Firefox called chrome
[2013-11-20 07:57:12] AutomatedTester: its been called chrome longer than Google Chrome came out
[2013-11-20 07:57:41] robinsmidsrod: AutomatedTester: oh, what should I use if I want to test Google Chrome?

[2013-11-20 07:59:03] robinsmidsrod: AutomatedTester: yeah, I*m using Test::WWW::Selenium in Perl, and I guess I should probably switch to something else?
[2013-11-20 07:59:54] robinsmidsrod: AutomatedTester: is IE 10 and 11 supported?
[2013-11-20 08:00:05] robinsmidsrod: or, correction, does it work at all?
[2013-11-20 08:00:31] AutomatedTester: IE10 works
[2013-11-20 08:00:40] AutomatedTester: IE 11 has a few issues iirc
[2013-11-20 08:00:50] AutomatedTester: it mostly works
[2013-11-20 08:01:00] robinsmidsrod: AutomatedTester: gotcha, so that error I mentioned earlier is probably that thing
[2013-11-20 08:01:09] robinsmidsrod: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/354628/selenium_ie_problem.png

[2013-11-20 08:05:46] AutomatedTester: so try both and see?
[2013-11-20 08:06:01] robinsmidsrod: AutomatedTester: if you look under "Remote Driver Response" in https://metacpan.org/pod/Selenium::Remote::Driver, does that reference the new protocol?

[2013-11-20 11:18:55] jimevans: Ok. Just about the only way I could hope to fix it would be to look at it under the debugger.

[2013-11-20 11:20:22] jimevans: ato: I assume as much, but I'm curious to know about the mechanism by which they get injected. Iow, are they injected via the remote debugging protocol.
[2013-11-20 11:20:53] ato: They must be, because the automation proxy interfaces are gone.

[2013-11-20 11:22:12] jimevans: ato: That's my guess, but I'm too lazy to browse the source.
[2013-11-20 11:22:13] lukeis: yep, i know
[2013-11-20 11:22:14] ato: But if you find a git clone that should be a lot faster.
[2013-11-20 11:22:22] jleyba: You can use git with chromium

[2013-11-20 11:23:14] ato: jleyba: Does that mean gclient no longer uses svn in the backend?
[2013-11-20 11:23:17] lukeis: viewvc is nice for quick browsing… but I really want an IDE to find things for me / jump around

[2013-11-20 11:29:03] lukeis: and I do have lots of disk space...

[2013-11-20 11:30:51] ato: Yes, the linking is the worst.  We found that single big CPUs (without HT) were better than lots of cores.

[2013-11-20 11:31:56] ato: Oh, I found them quite wonderful?
[2013-11-20 11:32:10] ato: Well it's better than what sorry excuse for a build system Mozilla has.

[2013-11-20 11:32:38] jleyba: gyp is pretty nice compared to other c build systems, but it's still a pain
[2013-11-20 11:32:55] lukeis: nicegraham: WTF...
[2013-11-20 11:33:09] ato: jleyba: You mean the fact that it generates makefiles?
[2013-11-20 11:33:11] nicegraham: that's how we roll over here :)
[2013-11-20 11:33:18] jleyba: nicegraham I think that's just the bootstrap to seed your client
[2013-11-20 11:33:22] lukeis: I'm in Fucking SF… why is my bandwidth to google shit?
[2013-11-20 11:33:37] ato: jleyba: The best part of the way Chromium uses gyp is the dependency tracking I find.
[2013-11-20 11:33:46] nicegraham: it's 2.2gb - so I hope not
[2013-11-20 11:33:57] ato: jleyba: So iterative builds are super fast.

[2013-11-20 11:35:17] lukeis: i'm not on a vpn here… just straight corp network

[2013-11-20 12:15:54] lukeis: and am I reading that right? seems like a decent amount of 'work' being done in a header file?
[2013-11-20 12:16:44] lukeis: everything's a .h?
[2013-11-20 12:16:48] jimevans: Each of the command handlers is an inline (header-only) class

[2013-11-20 12:17:01] lukeis: huh
[2013-11-20 12:17:23] jimevans: They are each subclasses of a base command handler class.
