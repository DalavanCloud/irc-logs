[2013-11-26 01:25:01] EdwardIII: selenium seems to be leaving FF open so i checked out preferences, it doesn't look like cookies are disabled, and i guess selenium wouldn't disable them by default? plus i doubt the default ff profile disables cookies anyway
[2013-11-26 01:25:59] pepijndevos: Selenium does not use the default profiel
[2013-11-26 01:26:21] pepijndevos: It appears to create a temporary profile with a lot of weird settings. I'm in the same boat right now
[2013-11-26 01:26:45] EdwardIII: pepijndevos: ah ok so i guess the best policy is to create a normal profile and force selenium to use that then

[2013-11-26 02:57:49] EdwardIII: randyg: well today i'm just seeing selenium triggering JS validation errors in knockout, but for no good reason. i.e. it enters details into a checkbox, clicks 'next', but then fails validation saying the text box must have content
[2013-11-26 02:58:17] EdwardIII: so i put in a test that says if there's a alert exception, print out the alert contents (so i can see what's going on), then i get an exception, inside the catch block, saying there's no modal
[2013-11-26 02:58:25] EdwardIII: or intermittently it passes JS validation

[2013-11-26 03:00:44] mboman|AFK, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-26 03:00:54] EdwardIII: yep it works manually no issue (in firefox)
[2013-11-26 03:01:13] EdwardIII: i've tried dropping in a couple of implicit waits but still seems to be having the same issues
[2013-11-26 03:02:45] randyg: if you inspect the text box, is it the correct one, and does it have content?
[2013-11-26 03:03:47] randyg: how do you locate the text box?
[2013-11-26 03:10:00] EdwardIII: well i tie it in with this custom method: self.wait_for('.controls input').send_keys('John Smith')
[2013-11-26 03:10:52] EdwardIII: here's how that looks: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/d849df7643c3b9739706
[2013-11-26 03:10:59] EdwardIII: well i can see it filled in successfully on-screen
[2013-11-26 03:11:55] randyg: meh, i dont have that much experience with selenium yet :(
[2013-11-26 03:12:16] EdwardIII: heh me neither, that's the issue
[2013-11-26 03:12:21] EdwardIII: but i always find out it just takes too much time
[2013-11-26 03:12:31] EdwardIII: like it takes hours just to code up a really simple process
[2013-11-26 03:12:35] EdwardIII: due to issues like this
[2013-11-26 03:13:04] randyg: well i do what you mean by that :P
[2013-11-26 03:13:12] randyg: know*
[2013-11-26 03:13:36] EdwardIII: it hurts me because good frontend test coverage for the app would be so, so awesome
[2013-11-26 03:13:51] randyg: also im the only one at work trying to figure out how all this works, so almost no support
[2013-11-26 03:14:34] EdwardIII: heh same for me, with everything
[2013-11-26 03:15:06] EdwardIII: i think this issue is some kind of bug between selenium and knockout, i think, for some reason, that knockout isn't detecting the change in input and so thinks the inputs haven't been filled in
[2013-11-26 03:15:17] randyg: plus i have no dev experience, only testing, which makes it even harder imo
[2013-11-26 03:17:36] EdwardIII: almost certain this is my issue: http://stackoverflow.com/a/10066589

But the test is not failed. Any ideas how to get rid of it? I am on 2.37 and when I google it I only see people that actually are unable to start the driver.

[2013-11-26 06:54:17] smccarthy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-26 06:54:22] ato: I think the SafariDriver is pretty much in maintenance mode waiting for patches from the community.
[2013-11-26 06:54:34] ato: So if you want to help him out, I'm sure he'd be very happy to assist.
[2013-11-26 06:55:17] DrJenkins: Ah cool, I´ll see if we can look into it!
[2013-11-26 06:55:29] DrJenkins: . Another driver question (you can tell that we are doing a run to clean up our drivers), we are running latest IEDriverServer with 2.37 in Windows 2000, the driver starts but a model pop up is shown saying that "command line server for the ie driver has stopped working". No clues in the log.
[2013-11-26 06:56:16] AutomatedTester: DrJenkins: and how is it on a modern version of windows?
[2013-11-26 06:57:44] DrJenkins: Just had the same problem on Windows 7, I guess that counts as "modern"? :P
[2013-11-26 06:58:27] AutomatedTester: well yea
[2013-11-26 06:58:35] AutomatedTester: its not over a decade old :)

[2013-11-26 06:59:56] AutomatedTester: are you starting up the exe or is webdriver starting it up?
[2013-11-26 07:01:03] DrJenkins: I guess I am starting it up: String driver = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(String.format("externaltools/IEDriverServer%1$s.exe", getOsArch())).getPath();
[2013-11-26 07:01:12] simonstewart: ato, DrJenkins: the safari driver is, indeed, in maintenance mode
[2013-11-26 07:02:12] DrJenkins: downloaded a new executable today for both 32 and 64 bit IEDriver
[2013-11-26 07:02:33] AutomatedTester: DrJenkins: interesting, the driver should start this up for you
[2013-11-26 07:02:44] AutomatedTester: driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();
[2013-11-26 07:02:53] DrJenkins: might be a bit legacy code in here... :)

[2013-11-26 12:39:29] [sola]: is there any example exits about selenium web scrapping ?
[2013-11-26 12:40:11] lukeis: i don't know of any… but typically using selenium for scrapping sites is overkill
[2013-11-26 12:40:40] [sola]: why ?
[2013-11-26 12:40:42] lukeis: mydog2 can comment right? ;)
[2013-11-26 12:40:59] richdownie, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-11-26 12:41:01] lukeis: because you can use http client tools that are much faster than a browser
[2013-11-26 12:41:11] [sola]: i was using casperjs/phantom js for scrapping but i just want to test  how it works on selenium.
[2013-11-26 12:41:27] [sola]: if is not a good tool
[2013-11-26 12:41:29] Dude-X: probably no better
[2013-11-26 12:41:37] Dude-X: or no worse
[2013-11-26 12:41:58] lukeis: it will be slower in overall run time than anything you can do with a headless utility
[2013-11-26 12:42:28] nicegraham: I'd think the only caveat would be if you have to drive the site to the page you want to scrape...
[2013-11-26 12:42:28] lukeis: a browser not only has to download all the extra resources (css, images, javascript) but then also render them!
[2013-11-26 12:43:03] lukeis: the caveat is some sites are near impossible to get through the flows necessary without a real browser (because they love complex javascript)
[2013-11-26 12:43:06] DrJenkins, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2013-11-26 12:43:20] nicegraham: they really do :)
[2013-11-26 12:43:22] DrJenkins, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-26 12:43:28] [sola]: i hate them all
[2013-11-26 12:43:59] nicegraham: they probably hate you scraping them :)
[2013-11-26 12:44:07] lukeis: if you have a site that you can't automate with a low level tool and need a full browser, then yes, selenium is your last resort for it :)
[2013-11-26 12:44:22] lukeis: and it should work well enough
[2013-11-26 12:45:08] [sola]: thank you for your replys.
[2013-11-26 12:45:29] [sola]: so now a example link will be very very good.
[2013-11-26 12:45:40] lukeis: seleniumhq.org ? :)
[2013-11-26 12:45:59] [sola]: i was already there.
[2013-11-26 12:46:10] [sola]: but it's too slow

[2013-11-26 12:48:11] [sola]: lukeis: thank you. i will be right back.
[2013-11-26 12:48:18] mydog2: [sola],  - what are you trying to accomplish?
[2013-11-26 12:48:41] mydog2: lukeis,  is 100% correct.. selenium for scraping will cause you to shoot yourself..
[2013-11-26 12:49:55] [sola]: mydog2: i'm will scrap http://www.sahibinden.com/
[2013-11-26 12:50:02] mydog2: if you're dealing with a site that uses jscript.. you need to get as close to the browser process as you can, which implies a headless browser.. i've not found anything faster than phantomjs/casperjs - yet.. and i'm always looking though.
[2013-11-26 12:50:10] [sola]: but they have a lot of ,honeypot
[2013-11-26 12:50:21] [sola]: so i have to use real browser for this operation.
[2013-11-26 12:51:24] [sola]: in normal cases im using casperjs/phantomjs but they are not good enough for this case.

[2013-11-26 13:14:27] lukeis: data mining is either breaking the Terms and Conditions of the site or very shady at least… so we shy away from it

[2013-11-26 13:15:05] [sola]: in our time legal and illegal are not clear definitions.
[2013-11-26 13:15:19] [sola]: they should make clear first.

[2013-11-26 14:22:34] ato: Also, the wire protocol isn't in the spec yet.
[2013-11-26 14:22:36] detronizator_: sorry, ghostdriver
[2013-11-26 14:22:47] lukeis: btw wb to the channel and congrats on the bambino ;)
[2013-11-26 14:22:55] ato: Though it's been decided that it should provide a normative JSON wire protocol as part of the spec.
[2013-11-26 14:22:57] detronizator_: lukeis: thanks :)
[2013-11-26 14:23:19] detronizator_: ato - to me, as a webdriver implementer, the WireProtocol are the "de facto" specs
[2013-11-26 14:23:22] detronizator_: that of course
[2013-11-26 14:23:28] detronizator_: will be changed
[2013-11-26 14:23:32] lukeis: ah, the logging api… good times there ;)
[2013-11-26 14:23:34] detronizator_: if the Specs are finalized and require changes
[2013-11-26 14:23:41] detronizator_: anyhow - logging
[2013-11-26 14:23:41] ato: :wiki jsonwireprotocol isn't quite up to date unfortunately.

[2013-11-26 14:24:09] detronizator_: so he came up with the "network" type
[2013-11-26 14:24:14] lukeis: yeah, they are just strings
[2013-11-26 14:24:14] detronizator_: and he wants to return an HAR file

[2013-11-26 14:24:20] lukeis: ooooh… no
[2013-11-26 14:24:24] detronizator_: exactly: they only support strings
[2013-11-26 14:24:40] detronizator_: so the "easy" way is to serialize into a string
[2013-11-26 14:24:43] detronizator_: but it's fucking ugly
[2013-11-26 14:24:55] ato: As far as I know, the finalized version of the logging section hasn't been written down in the spec yet.
[2013-11-26 14:25:08] ato: The one that's in the wire protocol isn't up to date.
[2013-11-26 14:25:09] lukeis: can you set a proxy with phantomjs?
[2013-11-26 14:25:17] detronizator_: yes you can
[2013-11-26 14:25:22] ato: But as far I'm aware, we didn't discuss non-string types.
[2013-11-26 14:25:25] ato: AutomatedTester: ^
[2013-11-26 14:25:26] lukeis: if so, i'd then point them to jimevan's post on the matter
[2013-11-26 14:25:41] detronizator_: lukeis: I have worked at Neustar/BrowserMob
[2013-11-26 14:25:42] lukeis: logging api is supposed to get the Browsers logs
[2013-11-26 14:25:49] lukeis: :)
[2013-11-26 14:25:54] detronizator_: I know enough on the topic, no worries :)
[2013-11-26 14:25:54] lukeis: then you *know*
[2013-11-26 14:26:15] ato: Is it a problem to return a base64'ed HAR file?
[2013-11-26 14:26:17] detronizator_: yep - but the specs aren't really stopping us from having a "special" kind of logging type

[2013-11-26 14:26:48] detronizator_: bearing in mind: phantomjs does expose those informations, but not as DEEP as a proper proxy can
[2013-11-26 14:26:54] lukeis: if you want to have a rogue implementation… fine by me ;)
[2013-11-26 14:27:18] detronizator_: well, phantomjs/ghostdriver strength can't be in "controlling a production browser" really
[2013-11-26 14:27:23] ato: detronizator_: Question if we want to _mandate_ that or make it optional
[2013-11-26 14:27:28] detronizator_: it has to be something outside of the box a bit
[2013-11-26 14:27:46] detronizator_: ato: not sure I understand the question :)

[2013-11-26 14:28:07] lukeis: if you want it you can do it… but the core spec will not have that type
[2013-11-26 14:28:15] detronizator_: lukeis: of course
[2013-11-26 14:28:32] detronizator_: I don't want to influence the specs in such a "specific" direction
[2013-11-26 14:28:38] detronizator_: that would be completely wrong
[2013-11-26 14:29:00] detronizator_: but I wanted to know if any talk of any other form of logging "vehiecle" had been discussed
[2013-11-26 14:29:05] detronizator_: but I guess a string is enough
[2013-11-26 14:29:11] detronizator_: for most cases of logging (if not all)

[2013-11-26 14:29:25] lukeis: might be better for phantomjs / ghostdriver to write that har file to a file and then respond in json wire with the location of that file
[2013-11-26 14:29:29] detronizator_: I'd go for "har" as a log type

[2013-11-26 14:31:53] detronizator_: so the HAR generated by GhostDriver would anyway be a limited, half-assed version

[2013-11-26 14:32:20] AutomatedTester: but its up to Simon, he wanted to write it
[2013-11-26 14:32:37] AutomatedTester: Chromium, Mozilla and now you are after it
[2013-11-26 14:32:40] detronizator_: plightbo_work is probably interested in what I'm doing today :)
[2013-11-26 14:32:48] ato: I'm very much interested in seeing the final spec before I make up my mind about it.
[2013-11-26 14:32:54] ato: The use case detronizator_ raises is interesting.
[2013-11-26 14:33:06] detronizator_: AutomatedTester: it's quite intimidating "Chromium, Mozilla... and me"
[2013-11-26 14:33:07] ato: (ofc we don't actually need use cases.)

[2013-11-26 14:33:26] detronizator_: AutomatedTester: GhostDriver PR
[2013-11-26 14:33:31] detronizator_: to support the "network" logging type
[2013-11-26 14:33:38] detronizator_: that would generate an HAR file
[2013-11-26 14:33:57] detronizator_: but HAR won't nicely fit with just "string"+timestamp+level kind of logging
[2013-11-26 14:34:01] detronizator_: that the specs describe now
