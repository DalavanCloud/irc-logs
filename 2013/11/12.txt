[2013-11-12 08:26:46] ato: jimevans: Shouldn't it actually be sent in the value field on a web element?
[2013-11-12 08:28:04] jimevans: yes, that's correct. but consider the remote case.
[2013-11-12 08:28:05] Dude-X, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-12 08:28:11] jimevans: you send a local file name.
[2013-11-12 08:28:25] jimevans: that local file doesn't exist on the remote server where the selenium server .jar is actually running.
[2013-11-12 08:28:48] jimevans: you need to upload the file first to the selenium server .jar machine, then use *that* local path in the sendKeys.

[2013-11-12 08:30:34] ato: Right, I get it now.
[2013-11-12 08:30:47] ato: What is the server supposed to do with it though?
[2013-11-12 08:31:30] ato: I seem to be getting a JSON object with the property "file" and a base 64 encoded blob.
[2013-11-12 08:31:31] jimevans: the server stages it temporarily, and when the sendKeys command is processed, it maps the file path to the local file path on the server, so that it can be properly uploaded.
[2013-11-12 08:32:30] ato: Right, so it will keep the file statefully until a sendKeys command is called on an input file field?
[2013-11-12 08:33:48] jimevans: yep. i believe sendKeys actually handles the file upload automatically.
[2013-11-12 08:34:00] ato: What happens if it doesn't get a sendKeys command?
[2013-11-12 08:34:25] jimevans: i don't think there's an exposed way to stage the file without calling it through sendKeys.
[2013-11-12 08:34:26] ato: Oh, okay.  So you shouldn't have to write it to disk and change the file field?
[2013-11-12 08:34:40] jimevans: no, the remote server should handle all that for you.
[2013-11-12 08:35:18] jimevans: you shouldn't normally have to implement the file endpoint.
[2013-11-12 08:36:18] ato: I'm not sure how FirefoxDriver used to deal with this problem, but I'm pretty sure we don't want to push a binary blob over the socket and into Firefox.
[2013-11-12 08:36:19] jimevans: it's pretty much only used by implementers that have to act as a relay
[2013-11-12 08:36:51] jimevans: the current firefox driver doesn't understand the end point.
[2013-11-12 08:37:04] ato: Right, trying to wrap my brain out what actually is the “remote” end in my setup.
[2013-11-12 08:37:16] jimevans: one sec. let me fire up a vm.
[2013-11-12 08:37:27] ato: It's not important, really.
[2013-11-12 08:38:00] jimevans: are you interested in the desktop case, or the firefox os case (or both)?
[2013-11-12 08:38:32] ato: Well I guess for Firefox OS there's really not much option.

[2013-11-12 08:39:00] jimevans: okay, well desktop doesn't have to know about it.
[2013-11-12 08:39:14] jimevans: because you're using a local file name in the sendKeys command.
[2013-11-12 08:39:41] ArSn, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-11-12 08:40:43] ato: Right, that might make sense.
[2013-11-12 08:40:48] ato: Thanks for the help so far (-:
[2013-11-12 08:40:59] jimevans: the only time the language bindings are going to hit that http endpoint is when the user has set a LocalFileDetector. in that case, if they're setting a LocalFileDetector, and they're using a local instance of FirefoxDriver, then it's okay to return an error.
[2013-11-12 08:41:13] jimevans: glad to help.

[2013-11-12 09:03:24] xirkus: jimevans: sure, that would be great
[2013-11-12 09:03:42] jimevans: xirkus: it all relates back to protected mode.
[2013-11-12 09:04:27] jimevans: when you cross a protected mode boundary (navigate from a site not in protected mode to one that is in protected mode, or vice versa), IE destroys and creates a new IE COM object underneath the covers.
[2013-11-12 09:04:54] jimevans: that means that if you were attached to any events that fire on the IE COM objects (like the IE driver does), your event handlers are orphaned.
[2013-11-12 09:05:14] jimevans: that's the reason that you have to set the Protected Mode settings the way you do in the driver.

[2013-11-12 09:06:02] jimevans: however, in IE11, the browser is occasionally acting like there's a protected mode boundary crossing, even if you *have* set the protected mode settings such that you should never cross one.
[2013-11-12 09:06:08] jimevans: and that breaks the driver.
[2013-11-12 09:06:11] jimevans: full stopl
[2013-11-12 09:06:16] jimevans: stop even
[2013-11-12 09:06:25] xirkus: jimevans: I see. Thanks for the explanation.
[2013-11-12 09:06:44] jimevans: and it's not because the IE driver is doing anything different. it's a change in the browser behavior.
[2013-11-12 09:06:58] xirkus: So the hacks setting the protected mode before executing tests cannot guarantee success.
[2013-11-12 09:07:16] jimevans: right. not for IE 11.
[2013-11-12 09:07:52] jimevans: i should also point out that IE11 turns on something called "Enhanced Protected Mode" by default. you'll have to turn this off too.
[2013-11-12 09:08:23] xirkus: jimevans: thanks. I'll communicate this back to our testers. Is there anything we can do to help expedite a fix?

[2013-11-12 18:52:29] AutomatedTester_: iirc
[2013-11-12 18:53:07] simonste_: But can you then add the history later?
[2013-11-12 18:53:13] simonste_: Or are you left with a broken git clone forever?

[2013-11-12 18:56:41] simonste_: Neither do I.
[2013-11-12 18:56:41] simonste_: Googling is also tricky with limited bandwidth
[2013-11-12 18:56:41] simonste_: and the git clone man page is Not Much Help
[2013-11-12 18:57:06] AutomatedTester_: what are you trying to clone?

[2013-11-12 19:10:14] simonste_: I need to spend some time playing with hg more. The "in place" branches in git are nice. I _think_ I can do the same thing with bookmarks in hg
[2013-11-12 19:10:15] simonste_: Nope
[2013-11-12 19:10:15] simonste_: I'm not on the jenkins list

[2013-11-12 19:12:25] simonste_: "magic"
[2013-11-12 19:13:41] AutomatedTester_: simonste_: I use queues in mercurial instead of bookmarks
[2013-11-12 19:13:55] AutomatedTester_: simonste_: they work nicely for my use case
[2013-11-12 19:13:56] simonste_: Yeah. I hear those are fun as well
[2013-11-12 19:14:45] AutomatedTester_: its nice if you want to apply multiple patches
[2013-11-12 19:15:38] simonste_: To be fair to GH, that nastiness in the jenkins repos was user error. User error compounded by an inability to disallow history rewriting, but user error nonetheless
[2013-11-12 19:15:49] simonste_: Though history rewriting sounds like a Really Bad Ide
[2013-11-12 19:15:50] simonste_: a

[2013-11-12 19:16:23] AutomatedTester_: but the "rebase all the things" allows that
[2013-11-12 19:16:36] AutomatedTester_: and thats what people are constantly shouting
[2013-11-12 19:17:35] simonste_: ?
[2013-11-12 19:17:50] simonste_: We only ask people to rebase their local changes before pushing
[2013-11-12 19:17:57] simonste_: That's hardly "rebase all the things'
[2013-11-12 19:18:08] AutomatedTester_: We do
[2013-11-12 19:18:33] simonste_: Yes, we do ask people to rebase locally to a single logical change before pushing to master
[2013-11-12 19:18:43] simonste_: Which is what I just said
[2013-11-12 19:18:43] AutomatedTester_: the git community, or more importantly the github community, say that PRs must be rebased before a merge
[2013-11-12 19:19:20] simonste_: That's the opposite of what the GH PR mechanism presents in its UI
[2013-11-12 19:19:37] AutomatedTester_: yes, github UI is wrong on many levels
[2013-11-12 19:19:54] simonste_: That's why we don't use it :)

[2013-11-12 21:57:04] lukeis: yes
[2013-11-12 21:57:32] jredimer: ok cool. I recently submitted my company for the Support page of the SeleniumHQ website
[2013-11-12 21:57:43] jredimer: I have no idea if it's been rejected or not
[2013-11-12 21:57:57] lukeis: ah, so there's a nebulous area :)
[2013-11-12 21:58:07] jredimer: nebulous?
[2013-11-12 21:58:27] lukeis: we as a project have talked about having 'sponsors' of the project and with those sponsort they would earn a place on our website
[2013-11-12 21:58:40] lukeis: the process of how to do that has yet to be fully defined
[2013-11-12 21:58:56] jredimer: You mean it's not free to be listed there?
[2013-11-12 21:59:08] lukeis: and thus requests for listing on support are getting put in purgatory ;)
[2013-11-12 21:59:34] lukeis: well, they were, they may be… they may not be… "free" is also subjective
[2013-11-12 21:59:50] lukeis: to get listed one wouldn't have to contribute monies
[2013-11-12 22:00:18] markboxall, quitting. (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[2013-11-12 22:00:30] jredimer: so what contribution should I provide aside from monies?
[2013-11-12 22:00:39] lukeis: I personally need to talk to simonstewart to get this moving along
[2013-11-12 22:01:00] jredimer: Ok, my submission if for the LogSuitePro tool
[2013-11-12 22:01:32] lukeis: well, contributions to the project could include code or help with organizing conferences or other efforts similar
[2013-11-12 22:01:42] jredimer: It's a real-time logging utility and works very well with all flavours of Selenium (including IDE). Was used in a project successfully (Selenium RC project)
[2013-11-12 22:02:09] lukeis: works with WebDriver too i hope :)
[2013-11-12 22:02:15] jredimer: What about a utility that will enhance user experience of Selenium users?
[2013-11-12 22:02:41] lukeis: that sounds like something that should get listed on the downloads page
[2013-11-12 22:02:42] jredimer: Works with any tool, Webdriver, Grid, QTP, etc .
[2013-11-12 22:02:51] jredimer: there's a downloads page?
[2013-11-12 22:02:55] lukeis: :downloads
[2013-11-12 22:02:55] selbot2: http://seleniumhq.org/download/ and https://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list
[2013-11-12 22:03:00] lukeis: first one
[2013-11-12 22:03:25] jredimer: well the tool is free for 30 days
[2013-11-12 22:03:34] lukeis: ah
[2013-11-12 22:03:57] jredimer: check it out logsuitepro.com
[2013-11-12 22:04:35] jredimer: we also developed the Selenium IDE plugin because IDE cannot do logging.
[2013-11-12 22:05:17] jredimer: It just makes Selenium logs look more main-stream
[2013-11-12 22:08:20] jredimer: Samit has developed a SeleniumIDE plugin to run tests on all browsers (Selenium IDE Webdriver), and now this tool also lets Selenium IDE do proper logging. So the result = Selenium IDE can become a serious automation tool.
[2013-11-12 22:09:18] lukeis: heh "Se IDE can become a serious automation tool"  (don't say that too loud)
[2013-11-12 22:10:39] lukeis: Record & Playback (in the opinions of many) is a flawed way of doing test automation, since none achieve "good" code generation

[2013-11-12 22:12:19] jredimer: but there are those who prefer record and playback. I have used Selenium IDE myself and it is awesome! Simple and it just works every time, after the selectors have been massaged a bit. As opposed to TestComplete or QTP, they're record playback are too brittle.
[2013-11-12 22:12:51] noahsussman, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-12 22:13:04] lukeis: yeah, the counter argument is that record/playback  will never generate maintainable code
[2013-11-12 22:14:11] jredimer: I am an automation professional myself. But manual testers in our team are also eager to do test automation, but they have no time or opportunity to pick up programming skills, so they want to do automation but they want to use the easiest tool first and that's Selenium IDE
[2013-11-12 22:14:53] lukeis: yep, I agree with that, but they should also understand they are create and throw-away as soon as they fail tests

[2013-11-12 22:15:53] lukeis: basically in my mind Selenium IDE could become a real product if it incorporated the concept of Page Objects into it
[2013-11-12 22:15:57] jredimer: that's true, that's why companies hire an automation specialist. But still, developers love using Selenium IDE to automation their setup (not necessarily running tests)

[2013-11-12 22:16:28] lukeis: i don't know any developers that would use IDE
[2013-11-12 22:16:43] jredimer: well perhaps that's an improvement. There's so many things missing in Selenium IDE however I think it's the best record/playback tool out there.
[2013-11-12 22:17:25] lukeis: have you looked at Selenium Builder too?
[2013-11-12 22:17:30] AutomatedTester_: jredimer: I wouldnt call it the best, I wouldnt call it the worst either
[2013-11-12 22:17:31] jredimer: I've been on two projects, the developers are using it to automatically setup their environment or populate the system with data
[2013-11-12 22:17:56] jredimer: I've heard of Selenium Builder
[2013-11-12 22:18:11] lukeis: oh hai AutomatedTester_

[2013-11-12 22:19:03] jredimer: Ok, Selenium Builder is like a RAD tool for Selenium
[2013-11-12 22:19:12] jredimer: Hi AutomatedTester_
[2013-11-12 22:19:50] lukeis: "RAD"  as in rad or  as in IBM RAD
[2013-11-12 22:20:16] jredimer: RAD as in Rapid Application Development, like C++Builder
[2013-11-12 22:21:28] lukeis: AutomatedTester_: how do you say it? That's an interesting idea? :)
[2013-11-12 22:21:58] AutomatedTester_: jredimer: Selenium IDE can be used by a RAD tool as well, and I think it fits well there

[2013-11-12 22:22:08] lukeis: how's china? you guys getting things done with the spec?
[2013-11-12 22:23:02] AutomatedTester_: jredimer: the "unskilled" automation engineer could quickly build something and then pass it to a "skilled" automation engineer

[2013-11-12 22:24:23] AutomatedTester_: jredimer: the issue that lukeis is meaning is that if you build, and only run, the tests in Selenium IDE you are going to create more work long term
[2013-11-12 22:24:30] AutomatedTester_: you lose the maintainability
[2013-11-12 22:25:06] jredimer: I agree
[2013-11-12 22:25:16] AutomatedTester_: this is also ignoring the shortcomings of selenium IDE against webdriver
[2013-11-12 22:25:36] jredimer: which is? popups handling?
[2013-11-12 22:26:01] lukeis: IDE translates directly to Selenese… the webdriver exporters are a hack (kinda like WebDriverBackedSelenium)
[2013-11-12 22:26:01] AutomatedTester_: html5 input types/ cross domain testing
[2013-11-12 22:26:09] AutomatedTester_: those are the 2 top ones
[2013-11-12 22:26:35] AutomatedTester_: also self-signed certs
[2013-11-12 22:26:51] jredimer: ok
[2013-11-12 22:27:08] AutomatedTester_: you dont want those in your normal browser because it causes other security and privacy issues for the tester
[2013-11-12 22:28:16] jredimer: you mean htmlunit for webdriver? the headless browser?
[2013-11-12 22:28:38] AutomatedTester_: eh?
[2013-11-12 22:29:13] jredimer: there's one driver for HtmlUnit in Webdriver, which seems to do html manipulations in memory but not actually display anything
[2013-11-12 22:30:21] jredimer: lukeis, what do you reckon? is there a place for our tool in the SeleniumHQ website?
[2013-11-12 22:32:40] jredimer: from the point of making Selenium Webdriver/RC/IDE/Grid logs look mainstream for users (enhanced user experience)
