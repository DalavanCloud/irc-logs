[2013-11-13 10:07:07] RjS2: couple of newbie questions (I'm just spinning up, and I'm coming from a django project): 1) I've seen several pages on, e.g. stackoverflow steering people away from drag_and_drop in favor of explicit mouse(down,move,up) claiming issues with how drag_and_drop works. The pages are aging (1.5-2yrs old). Is drag_and_drop still problematic? My first stabs with it did what I expected…. 2) Are there django specific resources I should be

[2013-11-13 21:34:30] selenium: hello
[2013-11-13 21:36:37] selenium: is there just bots here?
[2013-11-13 21:37:02] lukeis: nope, lots of people idle / lurk
[2013-11-13 21:37:18] lukeis: and it's 'off-hours' for most that talk here
[2013-11-13 21:40:50] selenium: String price =driver.findElement(By.xpath("html/body/table/tbody/tr[2]/td/div/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[3]")).getText();     	System.out.println("The lowest price" + price);
[2013-11-13 21:41:10] selenium: I am trying to use selenium to get the lowest price seats for concert tickets.
[2013-11-13 21:41:30] selenium: But when an event is sold out., the xpath to get the price does not show up and causes my test to crash
[2013-11-13 21:41:37] lukeis: ok, well that xpath is horrendous ;)
[2013-11-13 21:42:01] selenium: I am learning
[2013-11-13 21:42:55] selenium: I tried searching for ways people get arround 404, but that is beyond my ability
[2013-11-13 21:45:07] selenium: do you have any advice?
[2013-11-13 21:45:52] lukeis: on which topic? locating elements better or dealing with 404s?  (and these are very generic / broad questions)
[2013-11-13 21:48:10] selenium: what to do when an event is sold out. I just want the test to move on to the next dates.
[2013-11-13 21:49:09] selenium: xpath when even is sold out html/body/table/tbody/tr[2]/td/div/p[1]/span
[2013-11-13 21:49:43] selenium: would appreciate some help as to which command to use and I will go try to figure out how to do it

[2013-11-13 22:05:34] selenium: I did try/catch and changed the default catch to catch(NoSuchElementException e)

[2013-11-13 22:06:36] lukeis: you can also try findElements <- with an s, will return an empty list and not throw an exception if there is no match to the locator

[2013-11-13 22:07:35] simons___: Which is probably better. Using exception handling for control flow isn't the world's greatest idea
[2013-11-13 22:07:37] lukeis: the xpath you are using is very brittle… try to identify the element by looking at id's or class names in the dom
[2013-11-13 22:12:46] selenium: lurk more
