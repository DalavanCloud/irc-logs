[2013-11-03 08:04:24] selbot2: simonstewart: note from AutomatedTester 2 days ago: Marionette uses nsIDOMWindowUtils under the hood which gives us trusted events in the browser. Trusted events are events injected into the event loop so when the browser fires them it doesnt know the difference between them and pure native events from a keyboard for example. Only touch has been implemented so far for advanced actions.

[2013-11-03 15:56:03] Mathis: thanks
[2013-11-03 15:56:45] hirani, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-11-03 15:56:59] Mathis: but maybe you can tell me why driver.FindElement(By.Id("bla")) doesnt find the corresponding element on the given website...
[2013-11-03 15:58:32] Dude-X: if there's ajax or javascript code that is updating the site as you try to fetch an element, it may not work
[2013-11-03 15:58:33] Mathis: it definately exists on that website, I can even explore it in Firefox using the builtin developer tools
[2013-11-03 15:58:39] Dude-X: or the id starts with a number
[2013-11-03 15:58:52] Mathis: nope, doesnt start with a number
[2013-11-03 15:59:07] Mathis: but likely it is being generated using javascript
[2013-11-03 15:59:37] Dude-X: in general, if you can't find an element when running your script, it's usually because there some javascript that is running that is updating the DOM, and web driver can't "lock on" and get that element
[2013-11-03 15:59:48] Mathis: on the other side, I waited for the site to be built completely before jumping to the line where it should find that element
[2013-11-03 16:00:04] Dude-X: you have to alleviate those problems by the judicious use of WebDriverWait commands
[2013-11-03 16:00:37] Mathis: I am actually using the WebDriverWait command for waiting to let my element to appear on the side
[2013-11-03 16:00:45] Mathis: and it always times out
[2013-11-03 16:01:02] Dude-X: then focus on a event that occurs before that element appears
[2013-11-03 16:01:47] Mathis: will FindElement search beyond that focused element?
[2013-11-03 16:02:06] Dude-X: find element will find any element that is in the DOM so long the DOM isn't mutating
[2013-11-03 16:02:37] Mathis: after loading that site the DOM isnt being altered by any script
[2013-11-03 16:02:41] Dude-X: another exception is if the element is in a frame
[2013-11-03 16:02:59] Dude-X: then you have to switch to that frame first then get the element
[2013-11-03 16:05:02] Dude-X: a simple way to test if you can find the element is to put a thread.sleep or time.sleep before attempting to get the element
[2013-11-03 16:05:20] Dude-X: if that doesn't work, then you will need to execute javascript and use more advanced means
[2013-11-03 16:05:27] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-03 16:05:30] Mathis: isnt WebDriverWait supposed for that?
[2013-11-03 16:06:11] Mathis: I was testing it using a breakpoint
[2013-11-03 16:06:38] Mathis: navigated to the site, waited until it was loaded completely and ran the line with FindElement
[2013-11-03 16:06:51] Mathis: and it faults with "element not found"
[2013-11-03 16:07:09] Mathis: even while I can inspect the DOM inside the browser and look at it

[2013-11-03 16:10:00] Dude-X: is it inside a frame, Ma?
[2013-11-03 16:10:02] Dude-X: Mathis?
[2013-11-03 16:10:17] Mathis: yes, I think so
[2013-11-03 16:10:26] Dude-X: then you have to switch to that frame
[2013-11-03 16:10:36] Dude-X: it's under a frame if it's under <frame> or <iframe>
[2013-11-03 16:11:12] wlbentley, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2013-11-03 16:11:25] Dude-X: if that's the case, then you have to call driver.switchTo().frame() or driver.switch_to_frame() depending on your language binding
[2013-11-03 16:11:29] wlbentley, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-03 16:12:16] Mathis: yeah, its under a frame
[2013-11-03 16:12:43] wlbentley, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-11-03 16:12:59] Mathis: even the frame is under another frame
[2013-11-03 16:13:11] Dude-X: then you have to do switch to frame, then switch again
[2013-11-03 16:13:13] Mathis: I suppose, I have to switch to the highest one first
[2013-11-03 16:13:18] Dude-X: yes
[2013-11-03 16:13:29] Mathis: me smart :-D
[2013-11-03 16:13:42] Dude-X: it's hierarchal
[2013-11-03 16:15:40] Mathis: yeah, it worked fine
[2013-11-03 16:16:24] Dude-X: and when you need to go back to the root, switch to default content
[2013-11-03 16:16:56] Mathis: how do you create a temporary profile for firefox when creating the driver object?
[2013-11-03 16:18:10] Dude-X: it does that automatically....
[2013-11-03 16:18:12] Dude-X: oh
[2013-11-03 16:18:18] Dude-X: import FirefoxProfile
[2013-11-03 16:18:39] Mathis: huh?
[2013-11-03 16:18:59] Dude-X: do you want to create a custom profile in webdriver?
[2013-11-03 16:19:20] Mathis: no
[2013-11-03 16:19:22] Dude-X: web driver automatically creates a temp profile when you use the default
[2013-11-03 16:19:38] Mathis: I want to create a temporary one which is being destroyed afterwards
[2013-11-03 16:19:42] Dude-X: however i think on windows, things might work a little bit different
[2013-11-03 16:19:50] Mathis: ah, that wasnt mentioned by docs, IIRC
[2013-11-03 16:19:56] Dude-X: it should do that automatically and if it doesn't you have an older version of selenium
[2013-11-03 16:20:00] Dude-X: but that bug has been fixed
[2013-11-03 16:21:53] Mathis: got the latest
[2013-11-03 16:22:01] Mathis: got another question...
[2013-11-03 16:22:21] Mathis: how do you hide the webbrowser while operating on it?
[2013-11-03 16:23:07] Mathis: I basically use this framework to read out text elements from a website in an automated way and the browser window is just disturbing in later operation
[2013-11-03 16:23:26] Dude-X: what operating system you're running?
[2013-11-03 16:23:33] Mathis: Windows for now
[2013-11-03 16:23:43] Dude-X: hmm i don't know how to hide it for windows
[2013-11-03 16:23:51] Mathis: its platform specific?
[2013-11-03 16:23:52] Dude-X: on linux you can use xvfb, the x virtual frame buffer
[2013-11-03 16:24:07] Dude-X: or you can use phantomJS which is a headless webkit browser
[2013-11-03 16:24:14] Dude-X: or is that a headless blink browser
[2013-11-03 16:24:26] Mathis: ah, so there is no specific API command for hiding in Selenium
[2013-11-03 16:24:38] Mathis: I must use Firefox
[2013-11-03 16:24:53] Mathis: the web application isnt working properly on others
[2013-11-03 16:26:36] Dude-X: there is a CasperJS project that aims to be a Gecko headless browser
[2013-11-03 16:27:33] Dude-X: nevrmind it's SlimerJS and it still needs xvfb on mac/linux
[2013-11-03 16:27:33] Mathis: does it also run javascript?
[2013-11-03 16:27:56] Mathis: well, it isnt that important for now anyway
[2013-11-03 16:28:17] Mathis: thanks alot for your help
[2013-11-03 16:30:12] Dude-X: no problem

[2013-11-03 19:03:19] daemon:  Query the server's current status. The server should respond with a general "HTTP 200 OK" response if it is alive and accepting commands. The response body should be a JSON object describing the state of the server.
[2013-11-03 19:03:24] daemon: thats not true it jus returns a json object
