[2013-11-15 08:00:35] DrJenkins: yeah, might be an idea to dump it to a file instead
[2013-11-15 08:03:58] DrJenkins: is that a chrome.switch to log to file or a capability?
[2013-11-15 08:05:32] ato: Depends which logs you're talking about.
[2013-11-15 08:05:38] ato: Logs from the driver, server, JS, etc. can be retrieved through the logs interface.
[2013-11-15 08:06:00] ato: Logs from the chromedriver executable itself /might/ be available as remote/server logs.  But possibly not everything.
[2013-11-15 08:06:12] ato: (If Chrome is started as a subprocess for example.)
[2013-11-15 08:07:16] ato: I say “might” because I don't know the chromedriver that well.
[2013-11-15 08:07:22] jimevans: speaking of logs, we really need to nail down the logging spi and api. last time i talked with simon, he suggested i wait on implementing the api in the .NET bindings because he wasn't happy with it at present.
[2013-11-15 08:07:41] ato: I thought that was done the last day of the F2F in Boston?
[2013-11-15 08:07:43] mfeltner, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-15 08:07:47] ato: I wasn't there that day.
[2013-11-15 08:07:59] DrJenkins: my main focus is to just silence the output we have in stdout, like "[2.870][INFO]: waiting for pending navigations..."
[2013-11-15 08:08:02] ato: I've implemented the API two times already.
[2013-11-15 08:08:07] ato: So yeah, I'd really like for us to nail it down.
[2013-11-15 08:09:39] jimevans: i really, *really* don't want to log to a file in the IE driver by default, but i'm not sure how to capture server-side logs without either doing that, or horribly bloating memory.
[2013-11-15 08:09:53] mydog2: hmm.. looking to get a row where a col doesn't have content..
[2013-11-15 08:10:20] mydog2: the xpath to get th col //tr//td[@class='foo']
[2013-11-15 08:10:41] ato: jimevans: Exactly, memory has been up several times.
[2013-11-15 08:11:16] ato: Wasn't the consensus that the spec allowed for pruning of log records at a driver's leisure, and that users should take action to retrieve-n-clean logs in due time?
[2013-11-15 08:11:32] ato: I could be wrong.
[2013-11-15 08:11:56] jimevans: ato: tbh, i don't remember.
[2013-11-15 08:12:13] ato: AutomatedTester told me that they had decided lots of stuff in Boston, but I guess neither you or I were there.
[2013-11-15 08:12:31] ato: And that it lives in simonstewart's head until he writes it down.

[2013-11-15 08:14:38] jimevans: well, i was in boston for one day, at least. i don't remember hearing that they'd sorted out a ton on the second day, but maybe they did.
[2013-11-15 08:15:00] ato: We can hope they solved all the things :D
[2013-11-15 08:15:26] jimevans: i'll be able to attend the entirety of the next f2f, so that'll help
[2013-11-15 08:16:17] ato: Will it be in San Francisco?
[2013-11-15 08:16:34] jimevans: that's the plan, most likely in february.
[2013-11-15 08:16:38] ato: Ah, cool.
[2013-11-15 08:16:46] ato: I should be able to organize some time to visit the mothership then.
[2013-11-15 08:16:54] lukeis: yes, Come To Me! ;)
[2013-11-15 08:17:28] jimevans: g'day lukeis!

[2013-11-15 08:21:21] jimevans: oh, how right you are. i don't think the temp is going to crack 50 (F) the whole time i'm there. :)
[2013-11-15 08:21:38] jimevans: yeah, that's what happens when you have to book one ticket via corp travel (mine), and another privately (hers)

[2013-11-15 11:25:35] lukeis: sounds like you're stabbing in the dark here… use an inspector to see exactly where the "Ok" or "Cancel" buttons are
[2013-11-15 11:25:43] chp: Prometheian
[2013-11-15 11:25:45] lukeis: (should even show you which frames)
[2013-11-15 11:25:49] chp: ive found that if youre going into a subframe
[2013-11-15 11:25:53] chp: you hafta walk thru each frame
[2013-11-15 11:26:06] lukeis: if there's nested frames
[2013-11-15 11:26:22] Prometheian: How do I manage this? And I don't think so. It's the main site and then a popup.
[2013-11-15 11:26:33] chp: frame.switch_to_default_content(); frame.switch_to_frame(first frame); frame.switch_to_frame(next frame); frame.find_elemend_by_id(my element)
[2013-11-15 11:26:37] Prometheian: I have ids and xpaths for the buttons lukeis, but they don't work.
[2013-11-15 11:26:57] chp: Prometheian can we see the site
[2013-11-15 11:27:03] lukeis: is this externally accessible?
[2013-11-15 11:27:26] Prometheian: Sorry, it isn't. This is an internal site for the company to test on.
[2013-11-15 11:27:49] chp: if youre not finding your elements youre not in the right frame
[2013-11-15 11:28:01] Prometheian: My issue is finding the right frame.

[2013-11-15 11:28:28] Prometheian: Chrome to run tests, firefox for my personal xpath and id finding.
[2013-11-15 11:28:36] chp: you are using firebug in firefox ?
[2013-11-15 11:28:40] Prometheian: Yes
[2013-11-15 11:28:44] chp: ok
[2013-11-15 11:28:49] chp: open the page then open firebug

[2013-11-15 11:29:58] Prometheian: a meta tag
[2013-11-15 11:30:03] chp: alright well
[2013-11-15 11:30:05] DrJenkins, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-15 11:30:10] chp: start from the top and start drilling down
[2013-11-15 11:30:22] chp: then walk thru the frames
[2013-11-15 11:30:26] chp: for example
[2013-11-15 11:30:40] chp: on a cisco unity page, the first frame is VNavBar
[2013-11-15 11:30:47] chp: so i swtich to that frame first
[2013-11-15 11:30:48] Prometheian: Are forms equivalent to frames?
[2013-11-15 11:30:51] chp: no
[2013-11-15 11:30:53] chp: afaik
[2013-11-15 11:30:58] chp: lukeis can u confirm
[2013-11-15 11:31:10] Prometheian: That's fine, this isn't the form actually.
[2013-11-15 11:31:21] lukeis: no, forms != frames ;)
[2013-11-15 11:31:22] Prometheian: This popup is in a div tag.
[2013-11-15 11:31:25] chp: so you drill down and look for the grames
[2013-11-15 11:31:30] chp: stop going ahead
[2013-11-15 11:31:36] chp: stop thinking and just do and u will learn
[2013-11-15 11:31:37] chp: ;)
[2013-11-15 11:31:46] chp: so find ur first frame and switch to it
[2013-11-15 11:31:57] chp: then keep drilling down looking for the frames and changing to them
[2013-11-15 11:32:04] chp: until you are in the frame that contains your element

[2013-11-15 11:36:37] lukeis: you need to get the inspector to show you the "OK" text
