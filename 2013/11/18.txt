[2013-11-18 08:21:00] lmm: what does that mean?
[2013-11-18 08:21:12] lmm: it's the only iframe on the page if that's what you're asking
[2013-11-18 08:21:15] Dude-X: is it the only frame with iframe in the DOM
[2013-11-18 08:21:16] Dude-X: yeah
[2013-11-18 08:21:34] Dude-X: by any chance is this something like TinyMcE

[2013-11-18 08:22:50] Dude-X: maybe there is some javascript running on the browser side that is interfering with the find

[2013-11-18 11:28:20] Dude-X: maybe relocate the target
[2013-11-18 11:28:30] Dude-X: maybe the structure of the target changes a bit

[2013-11-18 11:32:09] thrustcore: oh yeah, aww
[2013-11-18 11:32:32] thrustcore: but speaking of the target, I've been relocating it like crazy
[2013-11-18 11:32:41] Dude-X: okay, try putting a sleep
[2013-11-18 11:32:45] thrustcore: I even tried commenting out everything until the second move, making that one the first one, an nothing
[2013-11-18 11:32:54] Dude-X: i presume that a whole bunch of javascript is running to process the drag and drop
[2013-11-18 11:33:08] Dude-X: it's updating the dom to change the state of what's been dragged in
[2013-11-18 11:33:44] Dude-X: if the sleep works, then you just need a WebDriverWait so that it can update the widget that is responding to the drop.

[2013-11-18 11:36:13] Dude-X: web driver wait should use big enough integer though
[2013-11-18 11:36:24] lukeis: webdriverwait is a max timeoutâ¦ if the condition succeeds it doesn't wait
[2013-11-18 11:36:35] Dude-X: yeah what luke said
[2013-11-18 11:36:51] Dude-X: what you can change is the time to wait between retries, that should be a small fraction of 1. it's set to .500

[2013-11-18 11:38:29] lukeis: why do you want to use a wait at all?
[2013-11-18 11:38:42] Dude-X: he's doing two drag and drops back to back
[2013-11-18 11:38:44] lukeis: this seems to be missing the point of a WebDriverWait
[2013-11-18 11:39:03] Dude-X: the second drag and drop is not working, but he should wait for the widget to update, before performing the second drag and drop
[2013-11-18 11:39:37] Dude-X: thrustcore: try a simple time.sleep(2) see if that makes it work
[2013-11-18 11:39:43] lukeis: ok, wait.until(<something that detects the widget is updated>)
[2013-11-18 11:39:54] lukeis: the timeout value *should* be a 'high number'
[2013-11-18 11:40:05] Dude-X: then use a webdriverwait where you wait for the widget is updated, it can be visibility of the icon that shows the widget is updated or some text

[2013-11-18 11:42:21] Dude-X: if its the same situation, but you may need a wait in between the second drag and drop, because there is some change of state to process the action of receiving thedrop
[2013-11-18 11:42:24] thrustcore: by switching the order
[2013-11-18 11:42:53] Dude-X: anyway try a naive time.sleep(2)

[2013-11-18 11:44:00] nry: Has anybody been able to get the WebDriverWait() functionality working correctly with Selenium and PhantomJS? I am doing a call to web driver like so: WebDriverWait(self.driver, 30).until(self._waiter_func) where self._waiter_func looks for a specific class of elements in DOM to be available. However, I am always getting time out exceptions even though when I take a screenshot of the page it...
[2013-11-18 11:44:00] Dude-X: then there is probably a subtle change to the DOM.
[2013-11-18 11:44:01] nry: ...is fully loaded.
[2013-11-18 11:44:31] Dude-X: nry: are you waiting on the element that you want to interact with?
[2013-11-18 11:44:58] thrustcore: this is my xpath for `target': //div[parent::div[contains(@id, 'results')]][contains(@class, 'ui-droppable')]/h3
[2013-11-18 11:45:21] thrustcore: after drag-n-drop, it gives me the exact same element as before the drag-n-drop
[2013-11-18 11:45:41] Dude-X: thrustcore: are you 100% sure?
[2013-11-18 11:45:43] thrustcore: and dragging an element into the text that this element holds does produce the expected behavior
[2013-11-18 11:46:09] nry: Dude-X: no I am not waiting on the specific element I want to work with, but no matter what element I am waiting on it seems to timeout even though I am fairly certain the page is loaded.

[2013-11-18 11:48:53] Dude-X: thrustcore: get firebug, and firediff for firefox. study what happens in firediff when you drag and drop. it's the tab that says "changes"
[2013-11-18 11:48:55] brockfredin: lukeis I did the By.id and it worked.

[2013-11-18 12:40:06] nry: Does selenium + phantomjs support the back functionality? eg. Can I simply call webdriver.back() and it will take me to the previous page? From my testing it looks as if this is not working.

[2013-11-18 12:53:51] ddary, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-18 12:55:06] nry: So does selenium not implement the back() functionality if you are using phantomjs as your webdriver? The only way I can get the functionality to work is if I do a time.sleep() in my script, which is less then ideal.
[2013-11-18 12:55:34] Dude-X: driver.back() should work
[2013-11-18 12:55:44] Dude-X: if your script overrides the back functionality though, that could be a problem
[2013-11-18 12:56:28] Dude-X: if you need to use a .sleep() before calling driver.back() then you need to use a WebDriverWait() so that the javascript that's executing stops mutating the dom up to a certain point

[2013-11-18 12:57:28] nry: I am not overriding the method at all. The thing is I am implementing WebDriverWait() with a 30 second timeout and it is still timing out, but when I do a time.sleep() for 5 seconds it works correctly, so I don't know why the explicit wait is not working.
[2013-11-18 12:57:53] Dude-X: you're waiting on the wrong thing

[2013-11-18 13:04:46] Dude-X: but this strategy works on using the standard tools available in webdriver
[2013-11-18 13:04:55] Dude-X: what's the topic AutomatedTester
[2013-11-18 13:05:01] nry: Ah cool so it is more ideal to wait for a clickable like: element = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.Id,'someid')))
[2013-11-18 13:05:16] Dude-X: nry: that might work in some cases.
[2013-11-18 13:05:19] Dude-X: not always
[2013-11-18 13:05:29] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: should Mozilla engineers annotate commits to the Firefox tree

[2013-11-18 13:59:36] lukeis: the "best practice" is to make your own intermediate repository (using something like nexus) to have a local cache of artifacts and all it does is proxy to repo*.maven.org when it doesn't have the artifacts requested (and then caches them)
