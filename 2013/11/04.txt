[2013-11-04 05:21:28] simonstewart: a) it's firefox specific
[2013-11-04 05:21:49] simonstewart: b) it breaks the expectation that already exists that complex types are marshalled by the caller of the script
[2013-11-04 05:22:04] simonstewart: c) I don't see the need for it

[2013-11-04 05:22:23] simonstewart: d) It introduces additional complexity to an area of the code base that already gives me the heeby-jeebies
[2013-11-04 05:22:44] simonstewart: (though it's still not as complex as determining visibility, which is own special kind of hell)
[2013-11-04 05:22:49] barancev: a) it is not, it is just implemented in Firefox for now :)
[2013-11-04 05:23:59] zeljkof, quitting. (Quit: zeljkof)
[2013-11-04 05:24:12] barancev: b) complex types, as I understand it, are non-standard types, Date is standard, and with html5 we will have to deal with date-typed fields

[2013-11-04 05:25:55] barancev: that's what I've implemented
[2013-11-04 05:26:12] barancev: but for executescript only, yes
[2013-11-04 05:26:20] barancev: formatted text
[2013-11-04 05:26:26] simonstewart: You've implemented it for executeScript. We're talking "getAttribute(value):
[2013-11-04 05:29:16] barancev: simonstewart: ok, if you are strong against this featue I'll revert it. but the current behavior is less suitable imho -- you get an empty map as the result instead of a date (as a string or timestamp or any other representation). because it IS a sandart type, not a complex one

[2013-11-04 08:06:35] jimmy927: Hello, i am trying to run simultanious selenium sessions, but i dont really understand what the capabilities are and what is possible. Currecntly we have a selemium hub "inside" our jenkins. But when i start more than one test at the same time it says: "Exception in thread "main" java.net.BindException: Selenium is already running on port 4444. Or some other service is."
[2013-11-04 08:06:47] jimmy927: Hi btw, :-)
[2013-11-04 08:06:55] jimmy927, changing nick to Jimmy927.
[2013-11-04 08:07:16] smccarthy: Jimmy927: you don't need to start the server more than once.
[2013-11-04 08:08:16] Mathis: hey
[2013-11-04 08:08:28] Jimmy927: smccarthy: i didn't thought i did.
[2013-11-04 08:09:06] smccarthy: Jimmy927: are you using a selenium grid ?
[2013-11-04 08:09:13] Jimmy927: smccarthy: yes.
[2013-11-04 08:09:20] Mathis: do you happen to know if there is some kind of callback when a part of the DOM is being altered by an AJAX callback or something?
[2013-11-04 08:09:24] Jimmy927: smccarthy: The grid is running inside my jenkins.
[2013-11-04 08:09:59] smccarthy: Jimmy927: How is it running "inside" jenkins? Using this plugin : https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Selenium+Plugin ?
[2013-11-04 08:10:00] jimevans: Mathis: what do you mean? i'm not sure i follow.
[2013-11-04 08:10:01] qba73, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-11-04 08:10:19] Jimmy927: smccarthy: Grid Hub 2.29.0 DefaultRemoteProxy listening on http://10.19.87.20:5555 test session time out after 300 sec. Supports up to 5 concurrent tests from
[2013-11-04 08:10:30] Jimmy927: smccarthy: yes.
[2013-11-04 08:10:48] Mathis: jimevans: I got a website which uses AJAX for callbacks, means the server sends a message to the browser which then reloads a message table
[2013-11-04 08:11:21] Mathis: I am using Selenium to read out the message table, I want to be notified when that message table is being updated by the server
[2013-11-04 08:11:42] smccarthy: Jimmy927: so in your code, how are you pointing your tests to the grid hub ? Can I see how you instantiate your RemoteWebDriver instance ?
[2013-11-04 08:12:01] Jimmy927: smccarthy: i use selenose.
[2013-11-04 08:12:12] smccarthy: Jimmy927: sorry, I dont know what that is
[2013-11-04 08:12:14] jimevans: Mathis: if you don't have a hook into the ajax library that you can use via javascript, you'll need to poll the page for the changes.
[2013-11-04 08:12:42] Jimmy927: smccarthy: http://selenose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
[2013-11-04 08:12:58] Mathis: ok, thanks
[2013-11-04 08:13:05] jimevans: np
[2013-11-04 08:13:19] Mathis: another thing... is it possible to hide the browser using the Selenium API?
[2013-11-04 08:13:28] Dave_B_: Jimmy: Have you got the server being created in the config file?

[2013-11-04 08:14:14] jimevans: Mathis: nope. there are some tricks you can use on certain operating systems (linux can use xvfb, for example), but the browser window is still rendering *somewhere*.
[2013-11-04 08:14:34] Mathis: with hiding I also mean minimizing the window
[2013-11-04 08:14:34] jimevans: you could look into a so-called "headless" solution, like phantomjs.
[2013-11-04 08:14:56] Mathis: so the window doesnt float around on the desktop
[2013-11-04 08:15:03] Jimmy927: Dave_B_: [nosetests] with-selenium-server = false with-selenium-driver = true
[2013-11-04 08:15:10] Mathis: minimizing would be sufficient too
[2013-11-04 08:15:12] jimevans: Mathis: again, the answer is "it depends". for example, the answer for IE is, "no, under no circumstances will you ever get that to work"
[2013-11-04 08:15:52] Mathis: I found some WindowHandle property on the driver object, maybe I could use that and call some Win32 API function for minimizing
[2013-11-04 08:15:59] jimevans: firefox won't work for certain if you're using so-called "native events" (i don't know about synthesized events).
[2013-11-04 08:16:00] smccarthy: Jimmy927: thanks, but I have no experience with that. The only advice I can give you is to figure out why the selenium grid hub is starting twice. I dislike the selenium grid jenkins plugin. I start the grid hub and nodes by just using the latest selenium-standalone-server jar .
[2013-11-04 08:16:17] Jimmy927: Dave_B_: I am trying to use the exiusting hub. And it works for ONE worker, but the second one compains about port 4444 being taken.
[2013-11-04 08:16:25] jimevans: Mathis: do not *not* NOT confuse the "window handle" for selenium with a Windows hwnd.
[2013-11-04 08:16:31] smccarthy: Then you dont need the jenkins plugin, and the browsers will also appear on the screen. I dont they they appear on the screen if you use the jenkins grid plugin
[2013-11-04 08:16:34] Mathis: ah, thanks
[2013-11-04 08:16:37] Dave_B_: Mathis: You could run a selenium node as a service meaning you'd not see the window on the machine if that's what you're after, but it may have some undesirable side effects

[2013-11-04 08:17:03] jimevans: a webdriver "windows handle" is just an opaque string, created by the driver, to uniquely identify the browser window.
[2013-11-04 08:17:07] Mathis: Dave_B_: I suppose so too
[2013-11-04 08:17:15] jimevans: it has no relation to OS-level window identifiers.

[2013-11-04 08:17:27] Jimmy927: smccarthy: But you still automate it from jenkins and get test-reports into jenkins ?
[2013-11-04 08:17:30] dimacus, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-11-04 08:17:33] Mathis: jimevans: maybe the docs should be updated in that way...

[2013-11-04 08:17:42] jimevans: Mathis: patches welcome.
[2013-11-04 08:17:51] Mathis: heh
[2013-11-04 08:18:12] jimevans: Dave_B_: if "as a service" means "as a windows OS service", that way is fraught with peril.
[2013-11-04 08:18:29] Dave_B_: jim: I know, stopped doing that here cause it was way more pain than it was worth
[2013-11-04 08:18:37] smccarthy: Jimmy927: yes. For instance, I use java with the testNG test framework. I have the testNG jenkins plugin, so I can see the nice report.
[2013-11-04 08:18:39] Dave_B_: technically it worked though, ish, sometimes
[2013-11-04 08:18:43] Jimmy927: smccarthy: But why is my code even trying to start a new server, shouldn't it just use the existing hub `?
[2013-11-04 08:19:01] smccarthy: Jimmy927: you didn't show me your code, so I can't comment on that
[2013-11-04 08:19:38] jimevans: Dave_B_: it might work better under windows xp, but there are just too many differences between a process running as a service and one running as a user executable. and i explicitly will not support it.
[2013-11-04 08:20:14] jimevans: most people try to use a service because they're too lazy to find other, more appropriate ways to make sure the selenium server .jar starts at login/launch
[2013-11-04 08:20:58] Dave_B_: Jim: Yeah I know, not suggesting you should! I used it as it allowed a bunch of IE instances to run at the same time without stealing focus from each other but that way ended in pain, both for IE and for Firefox (win server 2008 not XP)
[2013-11-04 08:21:38] *Dave_B_ has a dirty secret of a batch file that launches the .jar on startup now'

[2013-11-04 09:44:56] jimevans: there's a protected-mode behavior bug now with IE11.
[2013-11-04 09:45:50] jimevans: even if you turn enhanced protected mode off (new requirement), and you set the protected mode setting to the same value, i'm still getting crossing of protected-mode boundaries, which causes all kinds of problems, including the IE driver thinking the instance of IE that it's driving has quit.
[2013-11-04 09:46:16] jimevans: (which, technically, it has, and a new instance has been started in-place, unbeknownst to the user)
[2013-11-04 09:46:47] Dave_B_: :o
[2013-11-04 09:47:44] jimevans: that's nothing new. protected mode boundary crossings have had that behavior since IE8. it's the technical reason behind the silly "you have to set protected mode settings to the same for each zone"
[2013-11-04 09:48:56] jimevans: and, yes, before anyone asks, i've contacted folks on the other side of the castle walls about this. they're investigating, but no word yet.

[2013-11-04 12:48:52] jimevans: well, i'm not looking that closely. :)
[2013-11-04 12:49:17] lukeis: it is lunch time on the left coast
[2013-11-04 12:49:27] jimevans: but their latest blog post needs a big honkin' caveat emptor about using IE11 with webdriver (even on sauce)
[2013-11-04 12:50:59] jimevans: (since they just announced IE11 availability, and i *know* there are scenarios where it'll fail. i can prove it.)
[2013-11-04 12:51:20] lukeis: cc them on the issue :)
[2013-11-04 12:51:37] jimevans: i posted a comment to the blog post. hopefully awilson820 will see it.

[2013-11-04 12:52:57] jimevans: wanna have some fun? try running the .NET webdriver tests locally. you'll fail in the middle of CookieImplementationTest, and get cascading failures until you hit a test case that relaunches the driver.
[2013-11-04 12:53:11] jleyba: there are several tests like that
[2013-11-04 12:53:27] jimevans: jleyba: i meant in IE11.
[2013-11-04 12:53:28] jleyba: well, not for .NET necessarily, but I know of tests that leave the driver in a bad state
[2013-11-04 12:53:49] jimevans: no this isn't bad state, this is the driver losing connection with the instance of the browser it's driving.
[2013-11-04 12:53:51] jleyba: jimevans, lukeis: how do you feel about dropping DesiredCapabilities for Selenium 3?
[2013-11-04 12:54:06] jimevans: in favor of?
[2013-11-04 12:54:10] lukeis: replacing with 'Required' ?
[2013-11-04 12:54:10] jleyba: or rather, pushing it further down in the stack and making users use a proper API
[2013-11-04 12:54:24] jimevans: like the options classes?
[2013-11-04 12:54:24] jleyba: Oh god now.  Every capability should be required IMHO
[2013-11-04 12:54:46] jimevans: type-safety ftw!!!
[2013-11-04 12:55:05] jleyba: mainly I think the capabilities map is us being lazy and leaking implementation details
[2013-11-04 12:55:19] *lukeis looks at the recent 'attempting to make python bindings have some type safety' and shudders'
[2013-11-04 12:55:44] jleyba: Take that sauce post for instance
[2013-11-04 12:55:48] jimevans: jleyba: i think the case is less compelling in the dynamic languages case (python, ruby, et al)
[2013-11-04 12:55:49] jleyba: caps['platform'] = "WIN8.1"
[2013-11-04 12:56:40] jimevans: ugh. can we for the love of all that's holy stop with the platform shenanigans?
[2013-11-04 12:57:06] lukeis: rather that be:  caps.platform = Platforms.WINDOWS_HATE  ?
[2013-11-04 12:57:11] lukeis: (this is python after all)
[2013-11-04 12:57:21] jimevans: it's unfortunate that we separated out the uac vs non-uac flavors of windows with 'xp' and 'vista'
[2013-11-04 12:57:46] jimevans: because that's *really* what the distinction is (from the driver perspective)
[2013-11-04 12:57:52] jimevans: or used to be.
[2013-11-04 12:57:54] jleyba: well if i were dictator i'd scrap our work-happy constructors too
[2013-11-04 12:57:55] jimevans: brb
[2013-11-04 12:58:59] jleyba: wrt capabilities, we should drop weakly typed strings in favor of a proper API
[2013-11-04 12:59:16] jleyba: we should never have to refer a user to the desired capabilities wiki
[2013-11-04 12:59:22] jleyba: it should all be discoverable through the API
[2013-11-04 13:00:10] markboxall, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-04 13:00:23] lukeis: yeah, i agree… should there be a FirefoxCapabilities subclass that has methods like caps.setFirefoxBinaryLocation(File f)?
[2013-11-04 13:00:50] barancev: Platforms is important for Grid -- matching nodes
[2013-11-04 13:01:07] jleyba: no.. there should never be a caps.set()

[2013-11-04 13:01:42] stephend, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-04 13:01:54] barancev: or may be something similar to what we have for IE and Chrome?
[2013-11-04 13:01:58] jleyba: I don't know..something similar to ChromeOptions.  Point is it's a discoverable API
[2013-11-04 13:02:05] jleyba: instead of a hash map that could contain anything
[2013-11-04 13:02:53] ato: jleyba: Would you rather see that call down to key/value based capabilities?

[2013-11-04 13:03:05] jimevans: jleyba: i see your point. here's a concern, though. that totally destroys the extensibility story.
[2013-11-04 13:03:14] jleyba: ato: that's fine.  just an implementation detail
[2013-11-04 13:03:22] jleyba: jimevans: how?
[2013-11-04 13:03:31] Oscar2, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-04 13:03:35] lukeis: i would assume there's a generic "Options" class?
[2013-11-04 13:03:41] ato: I mean, you can achieve pretty much the same thing with something like caps.setCapability(FirefoxOptions.BINARY, "/my/firefox");
[2013-11-04 13:04:00] lukeis: but that's not very discoverable
[2013-11-04 13:04:08] lukeis: semi, but not very :)
[2013-11-04 13:04:20] ato: Well, it's not totally indiscoverable either.
[2013-11-04 13:04:22] jimevans: right now, folks like sauce can add their own capabilities to the hashmap, and intercept-and-decode on their end.
[2013-11-04 13:04:43] lukeis: same with other implementations… like Selendroid

[2013-11-04 13:30:47] awilson820: jimevans: thanks for the heads up. just approved it
[2013-11-04 13:31:11] jimevans: awilson820: thanks!
[2013-11-04 13:31:24] *jimevans hates the mess that jquery reliance has made on proper css selectors'
[2013-11-04 13:32:31] shannon: what mess?
[2013-11-04 13:33:50] jimevans: shannon: jquery encourages the use of non-standard css selectors. notably the :contains pseudoselector, which appears in *no* w3c css standard, and causes all kinds of confusion when people are forced to use standard selectors by webdriver, and whine and complain that :contains() isn't supported.
[2013-11-04 13:34:39] shannon: eh? I extended webdriver to bring in sizzle, therefor supporting :contains('') again
[2013-11-04 13:35:13] jimevans: as long as people fully understand that jquery/sizzle selectors *aren't* css selectors, then fine.
[2013-11-04 13:35:32] shannon: a: has(span.foo) not(span.bar) is a pretty neat selector
[2013-11-04 13:35:41] jimevans: but the distinction is lost on many, many, many people
[2013-11-04 13:35:56] shannon: oh you still have people confused?
[2013-11-04 13:36:08] shannon: heh funky
[2013-11-04 13:36:17] jimevans: shannon: spent much time with the selenium user community, have you?
[2013-11-04 13:36:28] shannon: nope

[2013-11-04 13:36:47] shannon: I've unfortunately been outside of the community
[2013-11-04 13:39:24] shannon: so blogging about my selector extensions might be not welcomed?
[2013-11-04 13:39:48] lukeis: nah, it will be… other people have done the same

[2013-11-04 13:52:36] lukeis: and thus the argument I'd raise is now you're teaching people non-standard CSS :-D

[2013-11-04 13:57:07] lukeis: yes
