[2013-11-29 03:01:27] l0gik, joining. (#selenium)

[2013-11-29 03:12:59] ato: There are many ways to group tests together.  If you're using JUnit you could have ‚Äúmeta‚Äù classes that group together a number of your existing test classes for example.
[2013-11-29 03:15:41] Cliff123: ato: I tried to use the augmenter, but it doesn't seem to work. Unfortunately no error is thrown. But when I'm debugging my code this line of code causes problems

[2013-11-29 03:19:35] ato: Well you must get either of the two (-:
[2013-11-29 03:19:54] ato: Because of well, strong typing.
[2013-11-29 03:20:34] barancev|2: strong typing rulez!

[2013-11-29 03:21:16] Cliff123: when I'm debugging, I can see that something is thrown. but with catch (Exception e) I cant catch it
[2013-11-29 03:21:50] barancev|2: 1) catch Throwable
[2013-11-29 03:21:51] ato: Why would you catch it?  Wouldn't that conceal the real reason the test is failing?
[2013-11-29 03:22:58] barancev|2: 2) tell what you see in debugger
[2013-11-29 03:23:23] Cliff123: When I'm going to use it productivly I don't want to catch it
[2013-11-29 03:23:33] Cliff123: give me a minute
[2013-11-29 03:23:47] ato: Are you able to make a reproducible and minimal test case of it?
[2013-11-29 03:23:50] ato: That would be useful.

[2013-11-29 03:30:57] barancev|2: so please configure the classpath
[2013-11-29 03:30:59] Twey: How do I check, using the Web Driver, that the page has been loaded (i.e. the given URL is valid and resolves to a real server that can be connected to)?
[2013-11-29 03:31:16] barancev|2: or just use selenium-server-standalone.jar as a sole dependency
[2013-11-29 03:31:54] ato: Twey: When the get command returns, the page has finished loading.
[2013-11-29 03:31:58] barancev|2: Twey: how can you do this check manually?
[2013-11-29 03:32:25] ato: You can't check if it resolves to a ‚Äúreal server‚Äù with Selenium, as it will only control the browser for you.  So you're at the mercy of whatever the browser does when it doesn't resolve a URL.

[2013-11-29 03:33:04] ato: Also, I don't understand what a real server is.
[2013-11-29 03:33:40] Cliff123: which classpath should I configure?
[2013-11-29 03:34:30] barancev|2: Cliff123: how do you run your tests?
[2013-11-29 03:35:00] Cliff123: Selenium Grid with the Jenkins Selenium plugin
[2013-11-29 03:35:09] Cliff123: but for now I run them localy
[2013-11-29 03:35:24] Cliff123: is the problem a missing dependency?
[2013-11-29 03:35:32] barancev|2: exactly
[2013-11-29 03:35:55] ato: It could be that your Selenium dependency is missing altogether, or that you're using the wrong one.
[2013-11-29 03:36:14] ato: For example some of the Selenium JARs only offer API's, without the dependencies.

[2013-11-29 03:36:46] ato: Like barancev|2 said, using the server standalone is always safe.
[2013-11-29 03:36:48] Cliff123: I'm using ivy as dependency management. this is how it is configured: http://pastebin.com/H8Qyz33A
[2013-11-29 03:36:49] ato: That's the whole shebang.
[2013-11-29 03:37:06] barancev|2: 2.29.0 is too old
[2013-11-29 03:37:14] barancev|2: please switch to 2.37
[2013-11-29 03:37:26] Cliff123: jenkins plugin isn't working with 2.37
[2013-11-29 03:37:36] ato: Did they break something? d-:
[2013-11-29 03:37:42] ato: Pretty sure we didn't.

[2013-11-29 03:42:17] Twey: ato: So a request for a non-existent page will never return?
[2013-11-29 03:42:39] Twey: barancev|2: My browser shows a ‚Äòcould not connect to server‚Äô error page
[2013-11-29 03:42:40] ato: Twey: It will return with the browser's 404 page or the server's 404 page depending on which exists.
[2013-11-29 03:42:45] Twey: Aha
[2013-11-29 03:42:58] ato: Yeah, or the could not connect to server page.
[2013-11-29 03:43:06] ato: Which is quite useful, if you want to test a browser (-:
[2013-11-29 03:43:15] ato: So Selenium only does /browser/ automation.
[2013-11-29 03:43:16] barancev|2: Twey: it will show a page your browsers shows to you as a human when you asked for a missing page
[2013-11-29 03:43:32] Twey: (well, actually I'm using PhantomJS :√æ)
[2013-11-29 03:43:44] barancev|2: and you can analyze the content of this page
[2013-11-29 03:43:53] Twey: barancev|2: *nod*
[2013-11-29 03:43:57] ato: Right, well PhantomJS is a specialized browser.  But the concept is still the same.
[2013-11-29 03:44:24] barancev|2: seriousely. we depend on the browser behaviour in this case
[2013-11-29 03:44:34] Twey: barancev|2: I'm having some difficulty with this because my ISP intercepts requests for missing servers and presents an error/search page, so what I'd test for varies depending on where I'm running the test
[2013-11-29 03:44:41] Cliff123: Ok, so I'll try and add all dependencies. After that I can remove the ones which aren't needed
[2013-11-29 03:45:34] Twey: (I'm testing a Web application, in case it wasn't clear)
[2013-11-29 03:46:33] barancev|2: the answer is same. analyze the content of the page returted by the interceptor.
[2013-11-29 03:46:52] ato: Twey: Well either you can run it in a stable environment, or you need to bake in the edge cases to your tests.
[2013-11-29 03:47:07] Twey: That's unfortunate
[2013-11-29 03:47:12] ato: That would involve catering for the different browser's error pages if you test on multiple browsers.
[2013-11-29 03:47:20] ato: Simple solution is to use something like Sauce Labs.
[2013-11-29 03:47:22] Twey: I guess I can't distribute my tests, then
[2013-11-29 03:47:31] barancev|2: do you have a better idea how to detect this responces?
[2013-11-29 03:48:15] ato: If your ISP is randomly (it seems?) rejecting access to your web app, that seems like a rather unfortunate starting point altogether.
[2013-11-29 03:48:37] ato: Running the tests and the app on the same machine is obviously another solution.
[2013-11-29 03:48:38] randyg, quitting. (Quit: randyg)
[2013-11-29 03:48:55] ato: Or setting up an SSH bridge to the server so you can request pages from the server on a given port.
[2013-11-29 03:49:00] ato: The possibilities are endless. (-:
[2013-11-29 03:49:14] Twey: ato: No, I was trying to use Selenium to test for broken links in my app (they are on the same machine)
[2013-11-29 03:49:33] ato: TBH I don't feel Selenium is the right tool for the job to check broken links.
[2013-11-29 03:49:47] ato: It would be much simpler to do that with curl.
[2013-11-29 03:49:56] Twey: But okay.  I checked the response from my ISP and it seems they don't indicate that the intercept has occurred in any measurable way, so I suppose there's nothing to be done.
[2013-11-29 03:50:04] Twey: Aye
[2013-11-29 03:50:22] ato: Yes, and because Selenium doesn't act as a proxy between your browser and your server, we don't do HTTP status codes.
[2013-11-29 03:50:28] ato: (Which are transparent to the user.)
[2013-11-29 03:55:35] ato: :note lukeis Can you add me to the mailing list please?

[2013-11-29 07:14:06] qtax^w: in Java with WebDriver when using JavascriptExecutor, and returning a hash with numbers from JS of the form { "foo": 123, "bar": 234 } can you easily/semiautomatically convert it to some java datastructure? or does that only work for lists?
[2013-11-29 07:15:14] ato: That specific structure could be converted using a JSON parser.
[2013-11-29 07:15:20] qtax^w: yea
[2013-11-29 07:15:54] ato: But there's nothing built in to Selenium that will deduce primitive types and create lists/dicts of structures like that.
[2013-11-29 07:16:22] ato: The exception is a list of DOM elements which will be converted into List<WebElement>.
[2013-11-29 07:17:15] qtax^w: so List<WebElement> is the only exception?

[2013-11-29 07:21:01] qtax^w: it should create a dictionary?
[2013-11-29 07:22:10] ato: This is the SPI, not necessarily what the Java bindings would do.

[2013-11-29 09:04:40] manoj9788: Oh!! Nice.
[2013-11-29 09:04:46] ato: So I've converted what we have so far into a slightly more structured format that will allow us to generate a doctree (through docutils), that helps ordering and structuring the documentation in a slightly better way.
[2013-11-29 09:04:58] manoj9788: that's nice...
[2013-11-29 09:05:03] apollo13: hmm, can someone confirm that send_keys with ` as value is just ignored by chrome/chromedriver?
[2013-11-29 09:05:11] apollo13: if I send a``a the result is aa
[2013-11-29 09:05:29] manoj9788: I shall help contributing to the docs, share with me the plan.
[2013-11-29 09:05:36] ato: manoj9788: So the plan is to first get an infrastructure for building and publishing them up and running, then to start treat what we have as the ‚Äúliving‚Äù documentation.
[2013-11-29 09:06:02] manoj9788: OK!
[2013-11-29 09:06:19] ato: I think the original plan of getting them up to speed with, or superseding, the official documentation first was a bad plan.  Because it meant we never released anything.

[2013-11-29 09:06:47] manoj9788: yeah! Right.
[2013-11-29 09:06:50] zac_sel, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-11-29 09:06:55] ato: So basically I want us to get it to a level where it's useful, and where all active work on documentation goes into that instead of the old documentation.
[2013-11-29 09:07:05] ato: There are some pretty big pieces missing still though.
[2013-11-29 09:07:42] ato: apollo13: I'd suggest having a look in the chromedriver bug tracker to see if it's an open issue.
[2013-11-29 09:07:47] apollo13: https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=521
[2013-11-29 09:07:50] apollo13: seems like it
[2013-11-29 09:08:01] ato: apollo13: I know there were issues with UTF-8 and chromedriver, but it's reportedly fixed in Chrome 31.

[2013-11-29 09:08:58] manoj9788: Yeah, there is a lot more to add..
[2013-11-29 09:09:16] ato: manoj9788: But I've updated the README which explains how to build the new docs.
[2013-11-29 09:09:20] apollo13: ato: but interestingly enough it doesn't drop the other stuff in front which clearly isn't ascii^^
[2013-11-29 09:09:37] manoj9788: looking at it now.
[2013-11-29 09:09:56] apollo13: ato: lol, changing my keyboard to english fixes it
[2013-11-29 09:10:11] ato: apollo13: Aha (-:
[2013-11-29 09:10:26] ato: Which layout do you normally use?
[2013-11-29 09:10:55] apollo13: german
[2013-11-29 09:11:08] ato: A backtick on a German keyboard should still be entered in Chrome though.
[2013-11-29 09:11:16] ato: Seems quite fragile to not allow that.
[2013-11-29 09:11:18] manoj9788: ato the original plan was to use Markdown (I remember when I had a talk with Santiycr) because it is easy to use than the RST. So Now again RST ?
[2013-11-29 09:11:29] apollo13: ato: well it works if I manually start chromium :)
[2013-11-29 09:11:35] apollo13: and type it myself
[2013-11-29 09:11:41] ato: manoj9788: Yes, rather forced to use that because of Sphinx.
[2013-11-29 09:12:08] ato: manoj9788: Also markdown is used only to format text.  It doesn't offer any way to structure content.
[2013-11-29 09:12:31] ato: apollo13: Yeah, exacly.  So IMO it should work through chromedriver too.  Because you as a user can do it.
[2013-11-29 09:12:34] manoj9788: Sphinx is good ..

[2013-11-29 09:13:22] ato: So I don't disagree that markdown could be nicer to write, but we're kind of forced into this position if we want to have more control over the document's structure.
[2013-11-29 09:14:16] ato: And I couldn't find any markdown parsers that added the extra functionality we needed and which produced doctrees.
[2013-11-29 09:14:34] ato: apollo13: Maybe you should talk to kkania about this.
