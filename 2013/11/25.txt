[2013-11-25 01:57:49] ato: manoj9788: I'd ping AutomatedTester about it.  We've discussed it quite a lot in the open source project, so it makes sense for the spec people to also have a look at it.
[2013-11-25 01:58:10] manoj9788: definitely....
[2013-11-25 01:58:14] ato: Now whether it'll be part of the first WebDriver milestone, or in a later revision remains to be seen…

[2013-11-25 01:58:52] manoj9788: Oh.. Why..?
[2013-11-25 02:00:06] ato: There have been suggestions of a DOM type aware protocol… meaning you could do things like SelectWebElement and InputColorWebElement in strongly typed languages.

[2013-11-25 02:16:18] manoj9788: there is an serious issue.. that there was a sudden change in one of the projects that I handle... that the app changed from a standard HTML into a XHTML now.. and the test are failing..
[2013-11-25 02:16:36] wilhelm_: Most sites using XHTML send it as text/html, though. Are you sure it's sent with an XML MIME type?

[2013-11-25 02:23:58] ato: IIRC you should be able to use XHTML if sent as HTML and not using any custom namespaces.
[2013-11-25 02:23:59] barancev: F12 in the browser, network tab, watch the header
[2013-11-25 02:24:13] ato: Problem is that the support might be spotty depending on driver…

[2013-11-25 04:08:58] Andrew_____: Does anyone know of an elegant way to deal with the effects of a control that, when used, can then cause stale element exceptions across all page elements on the next action?
[2013-11-25 04:10:28] simonstewart: Other than doing another look up?
[2013-11-25 04:11:35] manoj9788: hey ya.. simonstewart looks like... am seeing you here after long days...!!!
[2013-11-25 04:11:51] simonstewart: Conference season now over :)
[2013-11-25 04:11:54] Andrew_____: Or an elegant way to handle the re-lookup I suppose.  Previously this behaviours been quite contained so it's not been a problem, but when I use these sliders the next action will almost always fail.  I could put a sleep after the slide interaction but we don't have showers at work. :)

[2013-11-25 04:17:56] simonstewart: Typically I've seen that happen because a DOM mutating operation hasn't actually finished

[2013-11-25 04:19:31] Andrew_____: :D yeah that's what Im thinking.  I've just been lucky so far in that when its happened its been quite compartmentalised.  No matter, I'm sure I can figure it out.

[2013-11-25 09:14:29] hugs: simonstewart: WebDriver.js demo doesn't work in Firefox either. I'll have to find another way to save America...
[2013-11-25 09:14:33] nnmmnn: However, this seems to be outdated and fairly Java specific. I see in the docs that "DesiredCapabilities" is now deprecated
[2013-11-25 09:15:08] nnmmnn: Does anyone have any idea of how to enable performance logging for chrome webdriver in python?
[2013-11-25 09:15:13] simonstewart: hugs: node
[2013-11-25 09:15:15] simonstewart: or python
[2013-11-25 09:15:21] simonstewart: Why the heck aren't you pushing python
[2013-11-25 09:15:25] simonstewart: Are feeling unwell?

[2013-11-25 09:21:07] nnmmnn: ato: I see that in Java LoggingPreferences is under selenium.logging.LoggingPreferences. However, there is no selenium.logging in python

[2013-11-25 09:24:04] nnmmnn: lukeis / ato: I've seen that you can pass in the logging level, such as verbosity, but there seems to be a special "Performance Logging" mode that is implemented in webdriver2
[2013-11-25 09:24:18] lukeis: right, so WDBS in java was fixed… any other failures in CI that we should care about before trying to release with FF25 support?
[2013-11-25 09:24:37] ato: nnmmnn, lukeis: Looks like this just maps down to JSON?
[2013-11-25 09:24:43] lukeis: yes ;)

[2013-11-25 09:50:43] jleyba: lukeis: I believe FF and IE are the only browsers that capture the entire canvas
[2013-11-25 09:50:59] jleyba: Chrome and Safari only capture the visible viewport
[2013-11-25 09:51:05] lukeis: workweezle: there's your answer, try in chrome / safari ;)
[2013-11-25 09:51:18] workweezle: I like the canvas capture very much. It is proving a hindrance at the moment, for what we're after, though. :/
[2013-11-25 09:51:47] jleyba: the whole screenshot concept needs an overhaul
[2013-11-25 09:52:01] workweezle: Will try with diff browsers. We'll be running against IE, Safari, Firefox, Chrome for everything, so I guess I'll have to live with mixed results for now. ^^

[2013-11-25 09:56:11] lukeis: jleyba: that's the case with most of this…. Selendroid has gotten tons of bugs… fairly little outside contributions (but getting better now that FB has started using it too).
[2013-11-25 09:56:42] nirvdrum: Yes.  The whole screenshot thing is a fiasco.
[2013-11-25 09:57:27] workweezle: :(
[2013-11-25 09:57:43] ato: I wouldn't say that.
[2013-11-25 09:58:09] jleyba: you should be able to request a screenshot of: the entire canvas, the viewport, a specific element
[2013-11-25 09:58:14] ato: Lots of people are using it, and it sort of works with the caveats that it's been patched on to different browsers at different times with moderate success.
[2013-11-25 09:58:14] nirvdrum: ato: You haven't had to deal with it the way I have :-/
[2013-11-25 09:58:17] jleyba: and the driver should return an error if it can't satisfy the request
[2013-11-25 09:58:59] nirvdrum: ato: Lots of people also got hosed by the change in chromedriver.
[2013-11-25 09:59:24] nirvdrum: Many far less polite about it than me.
[2013-11-25 09:59:59] ato: That just brings us back to the problem that it isn't specced anywhere so implementors are implementing it differently.
[2013-11-25 10:00:00] nirvdrum: ato: If your goal is cross-browser testing, it's of little value for each driver to handle the screenshot request differently.
[2013-11-25 10:00:21] barancev: just use a separate screenshoter that catches the screen, not the page :)
[2013-11-25 10:00:21] ato: Mostly depending on what's technically possible in their respective browsers.
[2013-11-25 10:00:29] jleyba: nirvdrum: don't agree there - each browser renders differently
[2013-11-25 10:00:30] nirvdrum: That's sort of a weak argument.  chromedriver changed the behavior and it certainly wasn't due to ambiguity in the spec.
[2013-11-25 10:00:33] barancev: no "cross-browser issues" guarranteed
[2013-11-25 10:00:37] jleyba: so you're going to have multiple golden images anyway
[2013-11-25 10:00:40] ato: I didn't argue that browsers /should/ treat the command differently.
[2013-11-25 10:00:44] ato: You misread me.

[2013-11-25 10:01:06] jleyba: nirvdrum: they changed their behavior, but they are still compliant with the spec
[2013-11-25 10:01:10] nirvdrum: jleyba: The fact they render differently is why you'd want to test cross-browser.  Or am I misunderstanding?
[2013-11-25 10:01:11] ato: nirvdrum: Well, the spec says nothing about this.  So.
[2013-11-25 10:01:35] ato: And IIRC the WebDriver API's are pretty terribly documented also.
[2013-11-25 10:01:49] nirvdrum: I guess I haven't kept up with the drafts.  The last I knew, it was spec'd to be the full canvas.
[2013-11-25 10:02:00] jleyba: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/TakesScreenshot.html#getScreenshotAs(org.openqa.selenium.OutputType)
[2013-11-25 10:02:20] jleyba: javadoc is pretty clear that you're not guaranteed a consistent screenshot
[2013-11-25 10:02:29] lukeis: heh, svn ;)
[2013-11-25 10:02:31] nirvdrum: But that aside, if every other driver does full canvas and you also do full canvas, and then change it to be different than every other driver, it's BS to hide behind the spec.  There is a de facto spec at play, too.

[2013-11-25 10:05:35] nirvdrum: lukeis: I've conceded that scrolling makes sense there because the device sizes are fixed.  But on desktop, there is no bounds on a browser window other than the test device's dimensions.  Ergo, I feel that I should be able to tell the  browser to takes screenshots at various resolutions.

[2013-11-25 10:07:31] jleyba: all is well
[2013-11-25 10:07:38] nirvdrum: lukeis: In other words, if Chrome can take progressively larger screenshots with upticks in resolution, then it seems silly to me that I can't take a larger screenshot just because I'm using a device with 1280x1024 resolution, or whatever.  It's a software restriction that the driver ought to handle, IMHO.
[2013-11-25 10:07:42] workweezle: nirvdrum: You can sort of do that on desktop, by changing the browser windows size first, then capture the 'screen'.
[2013-11-25 10:08:19] ato: lukeis: In addition to being able to run on custom Selenium JAR's, we should be able to run on custom browsers. \-:
[2013-11-25 10:08:29] nirvdrum: workweezle: But you're constrained by the underlying resolution.  If you're using VNC on Windows, that may be quite low.  If you're using a VM, you can go larger, but you need to allocate more video RAM.
[2013-11-25 10:08:38] barancev: ato: *screen*shot has "larger pixels" than *page*shot if Appearance and Personalization\Display is set to 125%
[2013-11-25 10:08:44] nirvdrum: workweezle: Both actively work against lower cost test machines.
[2013-11-25 10:08:54] workweezle: nirvdrum: Ah, so larger than your "screen" might be capable. Yeah. That would be kinda nice.
[2013-11-25 10:09:05] lukeis: ato: yeah, i think so… but would require sauce providing us an option to install said browser in some way
[2013-11-25 10:09:22] ato: barancev: Oh really?  That seems like something we should make mention of in the spec.
[2013-11-25 10:09:30] nirvdrum: workweezle: That's actually how the IE driver works.  It fools Windows into thinking the screen is larger than it is, then maximizes the window, then captures the viewport.
[2013-11-25 10:09:46] workweezle: 'sauce' ?
[2013-11-25 10:10:00] lukeis: saucelabs

[2013-11-25 11:22:37] mydog2: however, i'd like to go one step further and add.. get the row where the td count = 7 and i have an anchor "a" that has an href='foo'
[2013-11-25 11:23:13] mydog2: i tried various approaches to add "contains(@href,'foo') with no luck..

[2013-11-25 11:40:23] jleyba: why do you provide chrome 28? (out of curiosity)
[2013-11-25 11:40:26] jleyba: that's ancient in chrome land
[2013-11-25 11:40:26] santiycr: using "chromedriver_version"
[2013-11-25 11:40:41] santiycr: we provide all the way to 27
[2013-11-25 11:40:52] santiycr: chromdriver2 isn't fully backwards compatible
[2013-11-25 11:41:05] santiycr: so we had to be able to keep users on chromedriver 1
[2013-11-25 11:41:27] santiycr: (no one likes their tests to suddenly start failing because sauce upgraded something)
[2013-11-25 11:41:28] jleyba: ah.  a little easier for us since the chrome team could just say "deal with it" :)
