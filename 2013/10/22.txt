[2013-10-22 04:09:01] wilhelm: Excellent. Opera Mini is great, but it's a stepping stone. The next logical step is Firefox OS, low-end Android - or an Opera product that doesn't exist.

[2013-10-22 09:48:44] jleyba_: I think jimevans has a valid point, if an element could be made visible with scrolling, it should be included as visible text
[2013-10-22 09:49:03] jleyba_: Someone just needs to figure out how that determination can be made in js :)

[2013-10-22 09:56:35] gdennis: we can already figure out whether the element that has the text could be scrolled into view, without scrolling it
[2013-10-22 09:56:57] gdennis: it's a criteria for interacting with it
[2013-10-22 09:57:47] gdennis: so I think it's just a question of specification
[2013-10-22 09:58:17] jleyba_: is that part of bot.dom.isShown?

[2013-10-22 09:59:19] gdennis: actually, what jimevans is suggesting should already be the current behavior of the atoms
[2013-10-22 09:59:33] gdennis: jleyba: yes
[2013-10-22 10:00:28] gdennis: isShown will not return false merely because something is scrolled out of view --- we have to determine that it can't be scrolled into view
[2013-10-22 10:01:00] gdennis: and getVisibleText relies on isShown
[2013-10-22 10:01:41] tilgovi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-22 10:02:17] gdennis: getOverflowState returns a tri-value --- the element is either (a) in view, (b) out of view and can be scrolled into view, or (c) out of view and cannot be scrolled into view
[2013-10-22 10:02:21] jkrocil, quitting. (Quit: Ex-Chat)

[2013-10-22 10:21:36] p_l: also, ChromeOS
[2013-10-22 10:21:45] p_l: anyway, it's just swapping
[2013-10-22 10:21:57] p_l: it's not pretending you have more ram, it actually *lowers* the amount of RAM you have
[2013-10-22 10:22:25] p_l: If you have a workload that *needs* lots of ram, it will be slower

[2013-10-22 10:43:58] _invitro: Anyone know if it's possible to stick a debugger in the browser with Selenium?  I just start using it with webdriverJS/firefox
[2013-10-22 10:45:13] Dude-X: now that the mac pro will be available in December, i won't be surprised to see high end video editing equipment to support thunderbolt 2
[2013-10-22 10:45:42] p_l: _invitro: unfortunately nope. At least not controlled with Selenium
[2013-10-22 10:46:19] _invitro: @p_l… ah damn, how do you mean not controlled with selenium?  Are there any other tools?

[2013-10-22 10:51:31] p_l: Dude-X: the point is, to connect Mac Pro without becoming bankrupt from rebuilding whole studio (and possibly losing software support in the process), you'll end up buying 3 separate card cages, each with its own power supply probably, if not more.
[2013-10-22 10:51:58] Dude-X: well, if it's not broke, don't fix/replace it
[2013-10-22 10:52:40] p_l: Dude-X: the new mac pro doesn't even deserve the name "pro" on it, IMHO. It resembles a gutted out O2 turned into appliance :>
[2013-10-22 10:53:23] Dude-X: well i suppose the lack of PCIe slots can be a bad thing
[2013-10-22 10:53:36] p_l: also funny amount of memory slots
[2013-10-22 10:53:58] Dude-X: funny in what way?
[2013-10-22 10:54:14] p_l: at least in tower case, with some extra fiddling, you can put 244G of ram with the old Mac pro, iirc
[2013-10-22 10:54:41] Dude-X: it's about 96 tops in the new mac pro right?
[2013-10-22 10:55:03] barancev|2: lukeis: can you go through issues that ask to add a link to the support page
[2013-10-22 10:55:48] barancev|2: if we still want to add links to commercial companies
[2013-10-22 10:55:53] p_l: Dude-X: supposedly 128G. Considering that a motherboard I can get into a computer the size of previous Mac Pro could support >256, it's not impressive
[2013-10-22 10:55:57] lukeis: barancev|2: i'm still not sure what to do about them… there was supposed to be some sort of sponsorship flow (aka give us $$$ for putting your link on our site)
[2013-10-22 10:56:15] lukeis: but that flow still has yet to get detailed out
[2013-10-22 10:56:19] barancev|2: yes, yes, that's what I actually wanted to say
[2013-10-22 10:56:27] barancev|2: let's make some decision on this

Why can't they just have a special partition that can act as a failsafe and let us do whatever we want with our device?... Annoying.

[2013-10-22 12:24:39] jimpurbrick, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-22 12:24:41] Dude-X: yeah that's the new iPad
[2013-10-22 12:24:45] petarm: AutomatedTester: newest ipad
[2013-10-22 12:24:52] AutomatedTester: oh god
[2013-10-22 12:24:59] Dude-X: but it seems to be a minor spec bump, faster CPU, new lighter form factor, and MIMO antennna
[2013-10-22 12:25:00] Dude-X: that's it
[2013-10-22 12:25:02] *AutomatedTester crawls back under his rock'
[2013-10-22 12:25:02] petarm: Exactly... lol
[2013-10-22 12:25:14] Dude-X: that means there will be an iPad Pro next year
[2013-10-22 12:25:28] Dude-X: and rumor is the screen will be larger. I wonder if it would be 4:3 though
[2013-10-22 12:25:32] lukeis: file that under things steve jobs would have never approved… "iPad air"
[2013-10-22 12:25:37] Dude-X: i like 4:3 aspect ratio for watching netflix 4:3 content
[2013-10-22 12:25:39] *AutomatedTester waits for the iPad iPad Pro Touch'
[2013-10-22 12:25:45] Dude-X: heh
[2013-10-22 12:25:46] petarm: lukeis: Yep...
[2013-10-22 12:26:06] lukeis: the thing is fucking light already
[2013-10-22 12:26:22] petarm: Dude-X: "petarm: the iPad 3 and 4 have near "reference quality colors" ... What does reference quality colors mean?
[2013-10-22 12:27:42] jimevans: barancev|2: that is correct, it does not. all it does is set up IE to use a proxy of your choice.
[2013-10-22 12:27:58] Dude-X: reference devices are what studios use to get high quality accurate reproductions
[2013-10-22 12:28:13] eaj, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-22 12:28:24] Dude-X: basically something calibrated to a spec
[2013-10-22 12:28:32] p_l: what is actually done is calibrating all the fucking time ;P
[2013-10-22 12:28:52] barancev|2: jimevans: the main part of the question -- can we drop hudsuckr?
[2013-10-22 12:29:00] p_l: there was at least one laptop I recall that had built-in colour calibration tool that required you to just close the lid
[2013-10-22 12:29:26] jimevans: barancev|2: i suppose. i don't even know what we're using it for. something with RC, maybe?
[2013-10-22 12:29:52] jleyba_: yes it's rc
[2013-10-22 12:30:11] Dude-X: if a playback device is reference quality, it just means "high end" and can be calibrated to a high end spec
[2013-10-22 12:30:27] Dude-X: unfortunately you can't calibrate an iPad
[2013-10-22 12:30:33] barancev|2: well, if it is RC we can't :(
[2013-10-22 12:30:49] jleyba_: When are we going to move RC into a separate project?
[2013-10-22 12:31:12] lukeis: soon?  if we can get simon back here ;)
[2013-10-22 12:31:13] barancev|2: let's start!
[2013-10-22 12:31:32] lukeis: 3.0 branch?
[2013-10-22 12:31:34] barancev|2: we need a crazyfun expert :)
[2013-10-22 12:31:43] *lukeis despises crazy-fun!'
[2013-10-22 12:32:11] *lukeis talks some more heresy and thinks buck will not be much more 'fun'...'
[2013-10-22 12:32:11] *jleyba_ hides'
[2013-10-22 12:32:13] petarm: Dude-X: Do you think the average user would care if their device can produce "reference quality colors"?
[2013-10-22 12:32:35] petarm: I should rather say "Apple's target audience would care..."
[2013-10-22 12:32:39] Dude-X: petarm: some geeks care about iPhone 5's 100% coverage of sRGB, and the excellent color display of the iPad 3+
[2013-10-22 12:32:55] Dude-X: for the average user, they will notice that things look really nice
[2013-10-22 12:32:58] Dude-X: but they won't care
[2013-10-22 12:33:03] petarm: Haha
[2013-10-22 12:33:12] barancev|2: more simple question is why hudsuckr is it server source tree, where it is loaded by WindowsProxyManager that is in clent tree
[2013-10-22 12:33:26] jleyba_: b/c it's RC
[2013-10-22 12:33:36] jleyba_: and the RC code is...scary
[2013-10-22 12:33:43] jleyba_: special
[2013-10-22 12:33:46] AutomatedTester: jleyba_: legacy
[2013-10-22 12:33:48] petarm: Thanks for the enlightenment... I am not getting either any time soon anyway :)
[2013-10-22 12:34:53] barancev|2: so client (indirectly) depends on server :(
[2013-10-22 12:35:03] lukeis: barancev|2: create a 3.0 branch and start stripping out RC ;)  (and before we merge we should probably create a "here lives old/dead RC" branch)
[2013-10-22 12:35:47] jleyba_: question: why do we need to wait until 3.0?  keep it all in the same tree for now, but start publishing two jars
[2013-10-22 12:35:55] lukeis: and incase you guys aren't aware:  https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/?repo=mobile
[2013-10-22 12:36:04] lukeis: (that was another part of the 3.0 discussion)
[2013-10-22 12:37:07] lukeis: i think it'll be cleaner for our tree going forward to git rm the stuff rather than move it and try to build separate jars
[2013-10-22 12:37:23] barancev|2: jleyba_: the same tree, yes, that's why I said we need a crazyfun expert, to reconfigure the build process
[2013-10-22 12:37:50] jleyba_: I could do it…but honestly touching RC stresses me out
[2013-10-22 12:38:02] lukeis: IDE needs to get updated I think (and to only have WebDriver formatters)
[2013-10-22 12:38:03] jleyba_: so I'll just wait for he :whobrokeit
[2013-10-22 12:38:04] selbot2: simonstewart
[2013-10-22 12:38:09] barancev|2: in 2006 we merged them. in 2013 we split them back. evolution
[2013-10-22 12:38:16] lukeis: :)
[2013-10-22 12:38:34] jimevans: so, here's my question. the standalone server, it will support rc and webdriver in 3.0, right?
[2013-10-22 12:38:40] jimevans: or will it?
[2013-10-22 12:38:47] jleyba_: webdriver
[2013-10-22 12:38:53] jimevans: webdriver only?
[2013-10-22 12:38:57] jleyba_: yes
[2013-10-22 12:39:12] jimevans: well, that oughta simplify things a bit.
[2013-10-22 12:39:26] lukeis: i think we should provide a separate jar that you can load on the command line with our webdriver only jar that limps along RC users
[2013-10-22 12:39:58] qaguy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-10-22 12:40:12] lukeis: or just freeze 2.37.0 as the last RC jar :)
[2013-10-22 12:40:47] lukeis: or maybe 2.38 (since FF will be out next week again)
[2013-10-22 12:40:59] jimevans: explain to me again why branching is bad?
[2013-10-22 12:42:04] AutomatedTester: its not bad?
[2013-10-22 12:42:17] lukeis: it is bad?

[2013-10-22 13:29:29] AutomatedTester: look at http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#selectors for valid ones
[2013-10-22 13:29:46] jimevans: jquery/sizzle != css
[2013-10-22 13:29:51] MaxSan1: nth-child
[2013-10-22 13:29:54] MaxSan1: same thing I think
[2013-10-22 13:30:12] jimevans: nth-child is css3, so it'll work on browsers that understand css3 selectors.
[2013-10-22 13:30:21] jimevans: (not IE, in other words)
[2013-10-22 13:30:27] MaxSan1: phantomjs?
[2013-10-22 13:30:30] jimevans: (well not IE < 10)
[2013-10-22 13:30:49] jimevans: maybe? probably? it's webkit, so i'd expect so.
