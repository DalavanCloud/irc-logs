[2013-10-09 06:43:59] garndt: I wonder if this has anything to do with the craziness within that window.  It seems that it's javascript that opens the window and injects a frame.  Then the frame is populated with an xml transformed with an xslt
[2013-10-09 06:44:19] garndt: or at least that's what I think is happening.  Could be wrong (I often am)
[2013-10-09 06:45:27] jimevans: garndt: you could try setting a page load timeout, and seeing if that lets you move along.
[2013-10-09 06:46:45] fatguylaughing, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-09 06:47:31] garndt: Where would I specify that? Is that something I can pass in when creating the webdriver instance?
[2013-10-09 06:49:23] tobie, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-09 06:49:31] jimevans: garndt: should be on the language bindings you're using. same place you'd set an implicit wait timeout. something like driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout().
[2013-10-09 06:49:58] operatiay, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-09 06:50:16] jimevans: if it's still loading, it'll throw a timeout exception, which you should be able to catch, ignore, and keep going.
[2013-10-09 06:50:50] garndt: Oh, thank you, sir.  I never noticed that method before.
[2013-10-09 06:51:23] jimevans: np
[2013-10-09 06:52:10] garndt: now after ignoring the exception, could I switch to that window and continue on or am I not able to interact with that window?  It seems to get into this state when trying to switch to the window to begin with.
[2013-10-09 06:53:10] jimevans: you should be okay. the switch to the window has an implicit "wait for load" behavior in the IE driver.

[2013-10-09 07:00:44] garndt: jimevans: great, that got me past the first hurdle.  Do you possibly know some causes that it had trouble navigating to begin with?  Seems that it was able to switch to the window in the end because I can maximize it and interact.  Not sure why the initial switch_to_window times out.

[2013-10-09 08:32:44] dimacus: if a convicted felon like me is allowed to vote, i think norwegians can sneak by
[2013-10-09 08:33:45] lord1234: dimacus: you're a felon?
[2013-10-09 08:33:46] jimevans: you forget, this is florida. governor luthor headed a drive to purge voter roles.
[2013-10-09 08:33:47] lord1234: what was your crime?
[2013-10-09 08:34:00] lord1234: jimevans: of dead people...yes
[2013-10-09 08:34:01] lord1234: thats a good thing
[2013-10-09 08:34:03] dimacus: yeah illigal gene splicing, i'm actually 90 years old
[2013-10-09 08:34:14] lord1234: ok there Dr Sing
[2013-10-09 08:34:25] dimacus: but apperantly it's illigal to be this damn good looking :-P
[2013-10-09 08:34:58] jimevans: lord1234: it'd be a good thing, as long as a significant number of other legitimate voters (mostly minorities) hadn't been caught up in the purge.

[2013-10-09 08:35:59] jimevans: and lest you forget, i live in the deep south, where we're less than 50 years removed from jim crow laws, which still cast a long shadow over politics.
[2013-10-09 08:36:35] lord1234: Tampa != deep south
[2013-10-09 08:36:58] jimevans: (by which i mean the "provisional ballot" workaround for those turned away at the polls doesn't hold water)
[2013-10-09 08:37:16] lord1234: i'd understand if you lived in okeefanokee or even...high springs
[2013-10-09 08:37:18] lord1234: but not tampa
[2013-10-09 08:38:08] jimevans: lord1234: quit being disingenuous. the initiative i'm talking about was state-wide, and the state as a whole certainly qualifies.

[2013-10-09 08:38:22] Dude-X: voter fraud is extremely rare where the person voting does something illegal
[2013-10-09 08:38:32] lord1234: Dude-X i disagree with you
[2013-10-09 08:38:42] Dude-X: the stats says it's like 0.1%
[2013-10-09 08:38:49] Dude-X: nationwide
[2013-10-09 08:39:00] lord1234: more like "thats how many get caught"
[2013-10-09 08:39:06] dimacus: it's not cheating if you don't get caught
[2013-10-09 08:39:16] Dude-X: i think the real fraud is those who count the votes
[2013-10-09 08:39:36] jimevans: Dude-X: boss tweed would be proud.
[2013-10-09 08:39:39] jimevans: :)
[2013-10-09 08:40:02] Dude-X: there has been cases where tons of ballot boxes have been disposed and uncounted, especially in areas where there is a high democrat voting block
[2013-10-09 08:40:04] jimevans: "as long as i count the votes, what are you gonna do about it?" - boss tweed

[2013-10-09 08:52:53] jimevans: lord1234: meh, i'm not sure it's quite that simple. a contributing factor, to be sure, but not the only reason.
[2013-10-09 08:53:06] lord1234: jimevans: sure...butr a large one
[2013-10-09 08:53:12] lord1234: I personally did not vote for McCain because of her.
[2013-10-09 08:53:27] nirvdrum: lord1234: McCain lost a lot of moderates and independents by trying to go super right wing.
[2013-10-09 08:53:37] lord1234: nirvdrum: every republican does that
[2013-10-09 08:53:38] lord1234: here's why
[2013-10-09 08:53:52] lord1234: to get the nomination, they have to pander to bible belt states and as such go super right wing at the beginning of their campaign
[2013-10-09 08:53:54] lord1234: once they get the nom
[2013-10-09 08:54:01] lord1234: they then have to downplay how right wing they really are
[2013-10-09 08:54:05] lord1234: IE: Mit Romney
[2013-10-09 08:54:11] lord1234: who was the governor of MA, the most liberal state ever
[2013-10-09 08:54:15] lord1234: and is about as big a RINO as they come
[2013-10-09 08:54:19] lord1234: though scott brown is bigger, no doubt
[2013-10-09 08:54:20] nirvdrum: I get that.  But McCain already had the nomination when he started acting insane.
[2013-10-09 08:54:29] jimevans: and we can thank karl rove for demonstrating that strategy works.
[2013-10-09 08:55:00] nirvdrum: Supposedly the theory was voters just wouldn't come out to support him.  But that doesn't make a ton of sense, since an abstention in that case is the same as a vote for a Democrat.
[2013-10-09 08:56:12] elopio, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-09 08:56:15] nirvdrum: jimevans: I was shocked when McCain lost in 2000.  Rove is an evil person.

[2013-10-09 08:58:07] lukeis: i voted for mccainn in that primary (thanks to CA for allowing 'independent' voters vote in either party's primary at the time… can no longer do that)… I really didn't want bush ;)
[2013-10-09 08:58:15] jimevans: thanks to the polarization exploited by such a strategy, it's difficult to find a moderate-anything candidate these days. because of primary-election politics, only more and more extreme candidates can make their way onto the general election ballot. incidentally, this is one reason i've decided to make a run for congress as a candidate with no party affiliation. radical moderatism ftw!
[2013-10-09 08:58:28] Dude-X: lukeis: that's pretty cool
[2013-10-09 08:59:03] Dude-X: it's also terrible that because the republicans have moved so far right, many democrats today are like liberal Republicans

[2013-10-09 09:06:36] dimacus: andreastt: what i meant to say is… vote for good economics etc… not vote for your party even though your party is doing something you don't fully agree with
[2013-10-09 09:06:36] jimevans: dimacus: would that you lived in my district. i think you'd be a strong supporter for me, given that's basically my position.
[2013-10-09 09:07:01] dimacus: probably
[2013-10-09 09:07:34] andreastt: dimacus: I don't think anyone can be fully behind all the policies of one party.  It's always a give and take.

[2013-10-09 09:08:25] dimacus: i don't like either at the moment… but fat chance anyone else would win

[2013-10-09 09:46:53] lukeis: no, you can ammend it
[2013-10-09 09:47:36] andreastt: Yes.

[2013-10-09 09:48:02] andreastt: Yes, what lukeis said works also.
[2013-10-09 09:48:18] lukeis: oh, there's one commit on top though
[2013-10-09 09:48:46] lukeis: should be fine as to do what andreastt said (add the sha)
[2013-10-09 09:49:04] andreastt: Alternatively you can provide an alias in the .mailmap file.
[2013-10-09 09:49:26] lukeis: i usually just set  git config --global user.email

[2013-10-09 09:55:43] lord1234: lukeis: i've never been to disneyland

[2013-10-09 09:56:23] lukeis: only time i've ever been to florida actually :)
[2013-10-09 09:57:21] davidlai: tip for disneyland, get a long range RFID writer they use for parking garages, and read in other people's Fast Pass ids.  Then you can easily get to the front of the line.
[2013-10-09 09:57:42] lord1234: davidlai: awesome

[2013-10-09 09:59:31] lukeis: yup, we did it last year (kids 3&1) this year should be more fun at 4 & 2
[2013-10-09 09:59:45] davidlai: which disneyland are you going to?
[2013-10-09 09:59:55] lukeis: California

[2013-10-09 10:00:23] jimevans: got a buddy of mine who says that in addition to fantasyland, tomorrowland, frontierland, and so on, they need to add dadland. beer, wings, and sports on a wide array of big-screen tvs.
[2013-10-09 10:00:34] cgoldberg: lukeis, you need to buy them the obligatory mouse ears
[2013-10-09 10:00:47] lukeis: jimevans: they have wine and margaritas in California adventure park ;)
[2013-10-09 10:01:06] dimacus: jimevans:  if you make that happen i'll vote you in as president
[2013-10-09 10:01:10] lukeis: cgoldberg: still have the minnie mouse ones from last year ;)
[2013-10-09 10:01:21] jimevans: they have beer and wine at epcot too.
[2013-10-09 10:01:45] lukeis: yeah, they have beer too… but like 2 options
[2013-10-09 10:01:48] jleyba: fun fact - epcot was originally supposed to be an actual town/city
[2013-10-09 10:02:01] jleyba: then they turned it into the park that every kid hates
[2013-10-09 10:02:01] davidlai: ah.. I don't think that one has RFIDs yet.  The moment I do, I'm gonna start RFID snooping there. ;-)
[2013-10-09 10:02:30] lukeis: yeah, last year they didn't have it… doubt they've upgraded
[2013-10-09 10:02:41] jimevans: jleyba: yeah, but it's not too bad for adults. :)
[2013-10-09 10:03:08] jimevans: drharmony and i go at least a couple of times a year to epcot.
[2013-10-09 10:03:12] lukeis: yeah, when i went there as a teenager I didn't see much point to epcot :)
[2013-10-09 10:03:26] jimevans: mission: space is pretty cool
[2013-10-09 10:03:46] lukeis: yeah, seemed like epcot had 1 ride
[2013-10-09 10:04:07] dimacus: i know there are bars in universal studios in orlando
[2013-10-09 10:04:07] drharmony: my kids loved epcot
[2013-10-09 10:04:08] lukeis: and then food from around the world
[2013-10-09 10:04:18] dimacus: but beer + wings + upside down

[2013-10-09 10:05:10] jleyba: pleasure island
[2013-10-09 10:05:12] jleyba: or something...
[2013-10-09 10:05:41] jimevans: yeah, there's pleasure island in downtown disney, but that's just basically a glorified shopping center.
[2013-10-09 10:05:46] drharmony: yes but that doesn't help those in the magic kingdom (which is dry). This would be like a parent soothing place
[2013-10-09 10:06:16] drharmony: even chucky cheese has beer (thank goodness)
[2013-10-09 10:06:28] Dude-X: a shopping place? that would please the missus.

[2013-10-09 10:46:05] manoj9788: rather its implemented using the threadExecutor()
[2013-10-09 10:46:48] manoj9788: jleyba It holds true for all right.
[2013-10-09 10:47:54] Dude-X: well ruby and python don't do multithreading well
[2013-10-09 10:48:18] Dude-X: i'd imagine the .net bindings are not thread safe either since they're modeled after the Java bindings
[2013-10-09 10:48:25] *jleyba <8 the js thread model'
[2013-10-09 10:48:59] jleyba: Dude-X it all boils down to the actual driver implementations - which are not thread safe

[2013-10-09 10:50:59] cgoldberg: (in python)
[2013-10-09 10:51:21] Dude-X: i suppose you can use multithreading in java where each thread has it's own instance of the driver; but you can't use the same driver in multiple threads (which is weird anyway)
