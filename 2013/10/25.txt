[2013-10-25 00:22:51] Garrick_: dhimil: what is selenium-webdriver-nodejs?
[2013-10-25 00:24:09] dhimil: Garrick_: That webdriver with keep-alive feature
[2013-10-25 00:25:15] dhimil: you can refer this commit: https://github.com/browserstack/selenium-webdriver-nodejs/commit/6e66f286a6061471e62c9896c5c0b4512b0ecb84
[2013-10-25 00:26:36] Garrick_: Forgive me, I do not understand what the keep-alive feature is for.
[2013-10-25 00:27:42] dhimil: So keepalive is useful to use one socket connection to send multiple requests
[2013-10-25 00:28:42] dhimil: In case of selenium where there are back to back http calls this saves the overhead of starting and terminating the connection for every requests
[2013-10-25 00:29:08] Garrick_: I see.
[2013-10-25 00:29:46] dhimil: instead there is one persistent connection [timeout dependent] to run the commands

[2013-10-25 00:31:21] dhimil: slowness is one of the common issue BrowserStack automate users complain about
[2013-10-25 00:31:37] dhimil: this reduces the time substantially
[2013-10-25 00:33:03] Garrick_: dhimil: so then how does one determine whether a session is closed or kept-alive?

[2013-10-25 00:34:06] dhimil: Generally after every test user will fire driver.quit() command
[2013-10-25 00:34:16] Garrick_: Right.
[2013-10-25 00:34:23] dhimil: connection is closed when the user fires the same
[2013-10-25 00:34:26] Garrick_: you driver.build() and then at the end it's driver.quit
[2013-10-25 00:34:30] Garrick_: err driver.quit()
[2013-10-25 00:34:32] dhimil: until then the connection is alive
[2013-10-25 00:34:54] dhimil: a connection can be closed by either parties
[2013-10-25 00:35:47] dhimil: It is closed gracefully when 'Connection: close' header is mentioned
[2013-10-25 00:35:57] Garrick_: Correct me if I'm wrong. With this keep-alive feature, a user that executed driver.quit() will not close the connection?
[2013-10-25 00:36:16] dhimil: In that the Selenium Grid will
[2013-10-25 00:36:46] dhimil: as connection is a mutual property between them
[2013-10-25 00:36:48] nikiforo: Does anybody have an experience of running tests on linux with remote driver pointed to a windows?
[2013-10-25 00:37:32] dhimil: Selenium jar uses jetty which defaults to keep-alive
[2013-10-25 00:38:09] dhimil: So when you use the Java Driver, connections are by default keep-alive
[2013-10-25 00:40:59] dhimil: Garrick_: Hope I was able to answer your question
[2013-10-25 00:44:29] Garrick_: Well, I understand the benefit of keep-alive. It's just unclear to me when a session is closed and when it's kept alive.
[2013-10-25 00:44:45] Garrick_: I'm looking at https://github.com/browserstack/selenium-webdriver-nodejs/commit/6e66f286a6061471e62c9896c5c0b4512b0ecb84#diff-5b17c554e93af77b159354a9ae38c4faR86
[2013-10-25 00:44:57] Garrick_: So when i use driver.quit, it would essentially close the session, right?

[2013-10-25 02:51:36] brian_hutton: Doesnät verifyEval match the retur of the js to the third argument? I think you should match your stored var to [0-9]{2} and return it if true, else append the 0, all inside the js
[2013-10-25 02:51:44] brian_hutton: I could be wrong though

[2013-10-25 03:00:24] brian_hutton: once you found the value of ExpiryMonth and saved it inside a variable.. say... num... you just do num.match([0-9]{2}) and it will return either true or false

[2013-10-25 12:48:10] barancev: the file atoms.js contains this comment I can't understand:
[2013-10-25 12:48:12] barancev: @fileoverview None of the files in core.* depend on webdriver.atoms.*, which prevents those files from being included in a final binary built by analyzing goog.provide/require statements. This file creates such a dependency so these files are available.
