[2013-10-01 13:00:30] riotz, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-01 13:02:17] Garrick: for example, with only hooked up Firefox, instead of doing `new Builder().withCapabilities(chrome).build()` where errors are thrown, i could ping the server to see if it has the capabilities I'm looking for?

[2013-10-01 13:05:35] Eravohn: Hello. There is WebDriverWait when you need to wait for a html node to load. After I click a button(a 'Follow' button), I guess it needs some time to register; Is there some WebDriverWait or something i can use for that? Right now a Thread.sleep(1000) seems to do the trick
[2013-10-01 13:06:11] phasze: Eravohn: most waits are done by waiting for an element to be present or visible
