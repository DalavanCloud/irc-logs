[2013-10-11 02:52:03] alex88: hi guys, I'm running selenium server and I'm trying to use it with mink and phantomjs, I'm trying to visit a page and on selenium logs I get
[2013-10-11 02:52:17] alex88: 11:50:13.853 INFO - Executing: [get: http://localhost.site.com/site/web/app_dev.php/] at URL: /session/49c86548-f1e2-4aaf-89bf-d2ec122ed5b0/url)
[2013-10-11 02:52:43] alex88: but it hangs there, request seems to start but never ends, ctrl-c gives a 499 line on nginx access log
[2013-10-11 02:52:56] zeljkof, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-11 02:52:59] alex88: instead from browser I get the result correctly
[2013-10-11 02:53:31] Dave_B_: does the browser window created navigate to the page you expect?
[2013-10-11 02:54:08] Dave_B_: and are you checking via your browser on the same machine?
[2013-10-11 02:54:45] zac_se, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-11 02:55:08] alex88: Dave_B_: nope it's phantomjs, so it's headless
[2013-10-11 02:55:23] Dave_B_: yeah but if you try a normal browser does it do the same thing?
[2013-10-11 02:55:29] alex88: btw just tested with another url and it works, so maybe it's not selenium/phantomjs thing...
[2013-10-11 02:55:38] alex88: Dave_B_: nope with chrome it works fine
[2013-10-11 02:55:42] alex88: I see the page in about a second
[2013-10-11 02:56:13] Dave_B_: hmmm, not sure why the nginx access log, I've had trouble in the past with headless browsers not working with some sites that hang waiting for focus
[2013-10-11 02:56:23] alex88: oh really? great :S
[2013-10-11 02:56:54] alex88: you mean trying from selenium to firefox?
[2013-10-11 02:57:03] Dave_B_: yep
[2013-10-11 02:57:23] alex88: mmhh let me find out how I can use firefox :)
[2013-10-11 02:58:07] alex88: I need to have it on command line right?
[2013-10-11 02:58:15] Dave_B_: headless messing with your site might not be the problem you're hitting of course, I'd definitely think that the nginx log seems like a sign there is something a bit funny going on...
[2013-10-11 02:58:23] Dave_B_: yeah
[2013-10-11 02:58:34] Dave_B_: erm, or you can define the binary location
[2013-10-11 02:58:55] alex88: Dave_B_: well the page on localhost and the site I've tried against is barely the same
[2013-10-11 02:59:09] alex88: local has just the developer toolbar that the production site hasn't
[2013-10-11 02:59:56] Dave_B_: the production site work ok via phantomjs?
[2013-10-11 03:00:43] Dave_B_: tbh i'm not a very good person to answer questions, loads of people know lots more (hopefully one of them will stumble along in a minute, I'm just trying to help cause I'm here...)
[2013-10-11 03:00:48] alex88: yup.. btw, just setting firefox and it automatically has found it :D awesome
[2013-10-11 03:00:56] Dave_B_: nice
[2013-10-11 03:01:10] alex88: Dave_B_: well thanks a lot man! btw request is stucking with firefox too
[2013-10-11 03:01:14] alex88: just "waiting"
[2013-10-11 03:01:21] alex88: let me try to run it without selenium on same page
[2013-10-11 03:02:22] alex88: mmhh without webdriver it loads correctly on firefox, with it hangs
[2013-10-11 03:02:28] Dave_B_: balls :(
[2013-10-11 03:03:19] alex88: I need to find out a way to start it with developer console opened, to check for requests
[2013-10-11 03:03:33] Dave_B_: or use another tool to gather all requests on the machine
[2013-10-11 03:03:43] alex88: tcpdump? :P
[2013-10-11 03:04:01] detronizator_: alex88: Dave_B_: consider USER AGENT filtering
[2013-10-11 03:04:06] detronizator_: many sites do that against PhantomJS
[2013-10-11 03:04:16] detronizator_: as it's one of the easiest to use as a scraping robot
[2013-10-11 03:04:27] alex88: detronizator_: don't have that actually (as I've the site locally)
[2013-10-11 03:04:29] Dave_B_: doesn't work in ff either so probably not that, but thanks for the suggestion, I'd forgotten about that
[2013-10-11 03:04:29] diancho, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-11 03:04:30] detronizator_: so, you need to run phnatomjs with an altered user agent (totally possible)
[2013-10-11 03:04:41] detronizator_: ah ok
[2013-10-11 03:07:55] alex88: btw let diagnose this after lunch :) way better!
[2013-10-11 03:07:59] alex88: thanks a lot guys for now
[2013-10-11 03:08:05] Dave_B_: np, hope you get it sorted!

[2013-10-11 08:25:23] andreastt: AutomatedTester, jimevans: So the spec says that META refreshes should be followed “transparently” if the value is less or equal to 1 second, if I read this correctly:
[2013-10-11 08:25:26] andreastt: “When a page contains a META tag with the "http-equiv" attribute set to "refresh", a response must be returned if the timeout is greater than 1 second and the other criteria for determining whether a page is loaded are met. When the refresh period is 1 second or less and the page loading strategy is "normal" or "conservative" implementations must wait for the refresh to complete before responding.”
[2013-10-11 08:25:42] andreastt: Why the arbitrary <= 1 second limit?

[2013-10-11 13:57:17] cedub: I have a remote development env on a headless linux install.  Is there a good way to run selenium tests remotely but utilize the browsers on my local machine?
[2013-10-11 13:57:54] cedub: Or perhaps is there a headless browser that someone would suggest instead so I can run my selenium tests remotely?

[2013-10-11 13:59:07] Dude-X: cedub: yes
[2013-10-11 13:59:26] Dude-X: on the remote box, it should have X windows either xvfb, or something
[2013-10-11 13:59:57] Dude-X: then you can ssh -Y into the box, (make sure you have X locally) and then you can run the tests and see the browser open locally
[2013-10-11 14:00:10] cedub: It's a headless dev server....
[2013-10-11 14:00:15] cedub: so no GUI
[2013-10-11 14:00:19] Dude-X: xvfb can run chrome, firefox heedlessly, otherwise PhantomJS is  webkit

[2013-10-11 14:00:26] Dude-X: no X windows at all?
[2013-10-11 14:00:28] cedub: no
[2013-10-11 14:00:33] Dude-X: you might get away with xvfb then
[2013-10-11 14:00:39] Dude-X: but it will install an X server
[2013-10-11 14:00:46] Dude-X: but that's not too bad
[2013-10-11 14:01:24] Dude-X: i used to do remote testing with ssh -Y, on windows and Mac
[2013-10-11 14:01:29] cedub: yeah, reading up on XVFB….does appear that we'd have to install a gui.
[2013-10-11 14:01:51] Dude-X: you don't need a gui per se, but you do need the Xwindows core
