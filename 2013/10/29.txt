[2013-10-29 07:54:26] simonstewart: lukeis: do you find selendroid is particularly fond of throwing StaleElementReferenceExceptions?

[2013-10-29 07:54:45] *lukeis modified my WebDriverWait to catch it and ignore'
[2013-10-29 07:54:54] simonstewart: Because I'm getting a little stabby about it
[2013-10-29 07:55:17] lukeis: it was a change introduced by someone else… and android seems to like to update it's element cache a lot
[2013-10-29 07:55:19] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: since I havent see you in a while when are you arriving in Shenzhen
[2013-10-29 07:55:22] jimevans: Dave_B_: i think i've gotten to the point i can't even think rationally about #141 anymore.

[2013-10-29 07:58:49] jimevans: ato: i've just tried building them with ./go, and seeing where the compile errors kick in. ./go essentially kicks off g++ to compile and link, but it's black majick to me from there.
[2013-10-29 07:59:00] ato: OK.

[2013-10-29 08:10:00] ato: AutomatedTester: True.
[2013-10-29 08:10:32] jimevans: (because i had to re-enable linking to xul.lib, which i didn't have to for FF24, but once i enabled it for FF25, FF24 started complaining until i linked against it too)

[2013-10-29 08:11:15] simonstewart: lukeis: any speculation on why we see so many SERE?
[2013-10-29 08:11:20] simonstewart: in selendroid?
[2013-10-29 08:11:24] Lope: now how do I dump the DOM?
[2013-10-29 08:11:31] simonstewart: driver.getPageSource()
[2013-10-29 08:11:43] Lope: or create a script that will do this and then dump the DOM.
[2013-10-29 08:12:16] lukeis: simonstewart: not exactly certain… goes down to RequestHandler.getKnownElements not finding the id anymore
[2013-10-29 08:12:44] simonstewart: Yeah.
[2013-10-29 08:12:55] simonstewart: Trying to get logged output is also proving taxing
[2013-10-29 08:13:01] barancev|2: jimevans: any news on public availability of Windows Phone Driver?
[2013-10-29 08:13:13] lukeis: simonstewart: it is? shows up easy in the logcat for me
[2013-10-29 08:13:28] jimevans: barancev|2: it'll be awhile yet.
[2013-10-29 08:13:35] simonstewart: Ah. So output from the handlers is in adb logcat?
[2013-10-29 08:13:49] lukeis: it is running on the device :-D
[2013-10-29 08:14:31] lukeis: the 'standalone' server process really does little when the app is running other than proxy the request

[2013-10-29 08:36:15] lukeis: simonstewart: btw why Stale elements are not a problem for me, I define a few 'wait' instances of WebDriverWait on my base PageObject that get this added to them:  wait.ignoring(StaleElementReferenceException.class);   and because of timing issues with slow emulators / fast real devices I pretty much mandate everything be wrapped with a wait / expected condition.  SRE's don't bubble up often anymore and when they do everyone knows how to handle them now
[2013-10-29 08:36:39] rbalent_, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-29 08:37:04] Dude-X: but lukeis not everyone knows to use wrappers with webdriver
[2013-10-29 08:37:14] Dude-X: or at least custom wait functions

[2013-10-29 08:37:36] ato: Also I notice interactions-mouse.cpp (amongst others) relies on X.  That's going to be problematic when Ubuntu removes the dependency.

[2013-10-29 08:39:59] ato: lukeis: I use "ato" everywhere else, it's just Opera that forced me to use "andreastt".  By the amount of confusion I'm considering switching back :D
[2013-10-29 08:40:04] ato: Dude-X: No one.
[2013-10-29 08:40:16] ato: Dude-X: Opera is also backing out of the W3C WG.

[2013-10-29 08:40:54] ato: lukeis: Apparently Mozilla wants me to use "atolfsen", so it's going to be confusing either way.
[2013-10-29 08:40:56] lukeis: death spiral or opera ;)

[2013-10-29 12:51:03] jimevans: AutomatedTester: hope i'm not stepping out of line replying to john's spec emails. if you want to handle all communication from that end, i'll shut up. :)
[2013-10-29 12:51:08] thomasvs: Hi.  When selenium moved to git, was there any discussion on splitting up the repository a little so for example people just interested in the python bindings could check out only that part, instead of 300MB of repo?
[2013-10-29 12:51:30] thomasvs: I'm curious to see if it was thought through with that in mind at all and if there are any useful workarounds
[2013-10-29 12:51:37] lukeis: nope :) because they python stuff depends on the other stuff
[2013-10-29 12:51:53] lukeis: you could try a sparse checkout
[2013-10-29 12:52:00] lukeis: (shallow clone)
[2013-10-29 12:52:05] jimevans: thomasvs: also, the initial clone is a one-time hit. after that, you don't have to worry about it again.
[2013-10-29 12:52:27] thomasvs: lukeis: but a sparse checkout still clones the whole history, just limits the view
[2013-10-29 12:52:33] thomasvs: the whole history takes about 1.1GB here
[2013-10-29 12:52:47] lukeis: thomasvs: you can do a shallow clone and it will not get the whole history
[2013-10-29 12:52:47] thomasvs: jimevans: yes, but it is a very big one time hit if all you want to care about are the python bindings
[2013-10-29 12:53:16] thomasvs: lukeis: ok, then I need to figure out how to do a shallow clone for a submodule
[2013-10-29 12:53:34] lukeis: git clone --depth 1
[2013-10-29 12:53:46] lukeis: selenium is a submodule of your project??
[2013-10-29 12:53:54] lukeis: (not recommended at all!) :)
[2013-10-29 12:55:25] thomasvs: lukeis: the python bindings are

[2013-10-29 12:55:46] lukeis: still doesn't make sense to have it as a submodule
[2013-10-29 12:56:29] DrJenkins, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-29 12:56:55] thomasvs: lukeis: because?
[2013-10-29 12:57:17] lukeis: because i'm not a fan of submodules ;)
[2013-10-29 12:57:26] thomasvs: oh, you're expressing a preference
[2013-10-29 12:57:29] thomasvs: ok, fine for you
[2013-10-29 12:57:36] lukeis: i think I can tout other reasons… but the selenium repo being so big should be a big one
[2013-10-29 12:57:59] thomasvs: well, yes, over here in collaborate-through-submodules land the big chunk of selenium repo is frowned upon :)
[2013-10-29 12:58:07] jimevans: any of the language bindings would require, at a minimum, the javascript tree, a not-insignificant part of the third_party tree, all of the crazy-fun build process, and the prebuilt c++ binary files. and if they're interested in using remote, they'd need the entire java tree too.
[2013-10-29 12:58:11] thomasvs: that's why I was wondering if it was considered at all
[2013-10-29 12:58:59] thomasvs: from our pov the python bindings don't get a lot of love, the code is a little messy and could do with some cleaning
[2013-10-29 12:59:00] lukeis: users submoduling the repo was not in consideration
[2013-10-29 12:59:13] lukeis: patches welcome ;)
[2013-10-29 12:59:26] thomasvs: we were willing to help in that regard, but some other devs are going to balk at adding 300MB to their checkouts
[2013-10-29 12:59:39] thomasvs: lukeis: yeah, that's what I'm trying to set up
[2013-10-29 12:59:55] thomasvs: this yak shave is already a few levels deep for one day though :)
[2013-10-29 13:00:24] lukeis: i don't understand why you wouldn't just have your own fork and deal with it that way, instead of needing a submodule
[2013-10-29 13:01:03] Lope: okay I've made a lot of progress

[2013-10-29 13:03:11] barancev: lukeis: it should not scroll
[2013-10-29 13:03:41] thomasvs: lukeis: because it makes it harder to maintain changes in our tree and have git do the heavy lifting when upstream accepts them
[2013-10-29 13:03:57] thomasvs: lukeis: anything is possible given enough work, but at some point the cost isn't worth it

[2013-10-29 13:04:41] Lope: is there a way to scroll the browser down?
[2013-10-29 13:04:44] thomasvs: anyway, the answer is, people wanting submodules was not considered, I get that
[2013-10-29 13:04:51] lukeis: thomasvs: heh, well, truly the only reason python (or ruby) aren't split out is because of the dependence on FirefoxDriver
[2013-10-29 13:05:38] thomasvs: great, the only known trick to do shallow submodules doesn't work since git 1.8.0, and the --depth argument to git submodule was added in the version right after what I have
[2013-10-29 13:05:44] barancev: the best method to scroll (with minimum side effects) in Java binding is ((Locatable) element).getCoordinates().inViewPort()

[2013-10-29 13:07:16] lukeis: thomasvs: also "keeping all history since Selenium existed" was a requirement to move to git  (and that we keep binaries in our source tree is why it is so freaking big)

[2013-10-29 13:09:02] thomasvs: most projects do that when they jump to git, because it's a lot more expensive compared to svn to have binary blobs in history
[2013-10-29 13:09:05] lukeis: they did (a bit) with respect to old dead branches
[2013-10-29 13:09:14] thomasvs: but, bygones, I'll need to find a way to make this palatable to the others
[2013-10-29 13:09:43] lukeis: tgz up a clone for others to copy… will be faster :)

[2013-10-29 13:14:19] phasze: hehe pretty please :)
[2013-10-29 13:14:24] nicegraham: this is the licenising thing

[2013-10-29 13:15:01] nicegraham: but martin was struggling with io7 afaik
[2013-10-29 13:15:07] phasze: licensing eh? So there's no beta or previous release that would work?
[2013-10-29 13:15:18] nicegraham: and that kinda slowed down the plans for releasing libimobile
[2013-10-29 13:15:26] phasze: or I should downgrade from io7 if I wanted this to work
[2013-10-29 13:15:27] nicegraham: yeah, 0.6.0 still works
[2013-10-29 13:15:43] nicegraham: that won't work with ios7
[2013-10-29 13:15:56] phasze: ah alright

[2013-10-29 13:38:16] davidlai: hey, I was hoping someone could help me with a windows 8 selenium grid problem. It seems like if windows 8 is not in desktop mode, selenium launches IE10 on the desktop and the browser UI interactions do not work while I'm in that metro mode.

[2013-10-29 13:39:24] jimevans: davidlai: the IE driver likely won't work in metro mode at all
[2013-10-29 13:40:31] davidlai: Is there a way to make windows stay in desktop mode?
[2013-10-29 13:41:37] lukeis: are you talking about windows 8?
[2013-10-29 13:41:49] davidlai: yeah, windows 8
[2013-10-29 13:41:56] lukeis: heh… i hate that too
[2013-10-29 13:42:20] davidlai: upon reboot, or after a test, sometimes I'm in metro mode, than when the next test queues up on selenium grid, it fails because it can interact with the UI
[2013-10-29 13:42:28] lukeis: i installed a 'start menu' application that mapped the start key to launch itself… gets me back to it every time ;)
[2013-10-29 13:42:59] lukeis: there's a certain swipe on the track pad that makes me go to the grid screen every time...
[2013-10-29 13:43:17] lukeis: thankfully I don't have to use win8 that often :-D
