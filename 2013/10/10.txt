[2013-10-10 06:14:23] barancev: why do selenium documentation uses google search for all examples?
[2013-10-10 06:15:04] jimevans: barancev: because it used to be the canonical example, which could be counted on to work mostly for everyone.
[2013-10-10 06:15:54] jimevans: lord1234: i've got a private driver for mobile web using an app on windows phone.
[2013-10-10 06:16:03] jimevans: it'll be open-sourced "eventually"
[2013-10-10 06:16:15] barancev: unfortunately samples are just wrong for selenium RC, with the current state of the google search
[2013-10-10 06:16:20] jimevans: it's not ready for prime-time yet.
[2013-10-10 06:17:03] jimevans: barancev: i'm utterly unsurprised. also, with selenium rc, ask me if i care. go ahead, ask me. :)

[2013-10-10 10:35:19] mehwork: i'm trying to find a string on a web app, but i don't know what page it's on and the app has no search functionality, and it only shows up dynamically in the DOM when the page is loaded. Is there a way for selenium to auto-click around all pages of a site and tell me when it found the string or something?
[2013-10-10 10:36:07] lord12341: mehwork: that sounds like a badly designed page
[2013-10-10 10:36:12] phasze: ^
[2013-10-10 10:36:39] davidlai: Are you talking about pagination?
[2013-10-10 10:37:11] davidlai: like you don't know what sub pane something is on, whether it's page 1 or page 100
[2013-10-10 10:37:38] mehwork: lord12341: it's a jquery mobile based webapp. I don't see how that makes it a bad design. It's a webapp with a lot of content, and you have to be logged in to use it because it's a private application
[2013-10-10 10:38:06] mehwork: davidlai: kinda
[2013-10-10 10:38:28] mehwork: but it's not pagination per se, it's a menu that dynamically loads diff pages
[2013-10-10 10:38:57] mehwork: a really big side pane menu with lots of sub menus
[2013-10-10 10:39:03] davidlai: do you have an public example for us to look at?
[2013-10-10 10:39:13] mehwork: no, unfortunately
[2013-10-10 10:39:28] mehwork: but it should be easy to imagine. It's a common design
[2013-10-10 10:39:43] davidlai: are these hover over menus?
[2013-10-10 10:39:49] mehwork: the pagination example might be easier to imagine
[2013-10-10 10:39:55] mehwork: davidlai: no just click
[2013-10-10 10:39:58] davidlai: right now I have no idea what it looks like right now.
[2013-10-10 10:40:08] lord12341: so find every link element
[2013-10-10 10:40:13] mehwork: just imagine paginated pages and i'm trying to find which page it's on
[2013-10-10 10:40:20] jimevans: mehwork: are you testing this app? or is this automation for another purpose?
[2013-10-10 10:40:25] lord12341: click on them, then click back, search for text, go back, refind, click again, and so forth
[2013-10-10 10:40:36] mehwork: lord12341: they're dynamically loaded once you click though. I can't just grep curl output
[2013-10-10 10:40:55] lord12341: you refind each time you click
[2013-10-10 10:40:57] mehwork: lord12341: that takes forever obviously i'm trying to find a way to automate that or i wouldnt be asking
[2013-10-10 10:40:59] lord12341: you can grep the html source
[2013-10-10 10:41:06] lord12341: thats what selenium will let u do
[2013-10-10 10:41:44] jimevans: i'll tell ya, this is the kind of thing that just *begs* for an api.
[2013-10-10 10:42:20] mehwork: jimevans: a little of both
[2013-10-10 10:42:40] mehwork: jimevans: what do you mean
[2013-10-10 10:44:01] jimevans: attempting to use the UI of the app to do what you're attempting is the most fragile, least efficient way to approach it. your app should have an api that can be used for this, and if it doesn't then the person designing the app is...
[2013-10-10 10:44:06] davidlai: For pagination, I'll tell you the approach I use is one of two ways.  1. loop through all the pages (very slow) You'll have to keep track of selectors because elements do stale as you paginate through the interface, 2. Use javascript injection to insert a ajax call simulating what the pages does, to get the exact page.
[2013-10-10 10:44:19] jimevans: well, i can't come up with a polite way to describe what i think of the app designer.
[2013-10-10 10:45:04] lord12341: jimevans: fluffy kittens
[2013-10-10 10:45:08] lord12341: think of fluffy kittens
[2013-10-10 10:45:13] mehwork: jimevans: well it does have an restful api for certain things but it doesn't have a specific search api
[2013-10-10 10:45:37] lord12341: sounds like you need to write an api?
[2013-10-10 10:46:31] jimevans: mehwork: the reason i asked about testing is that if you're working on testing the app, you shouldn't have to do searching; you should already know the data you're looking for, and then how to find it.
[2013-10-10 10:46:45] jimevans: if this automation is for another purpose, that might not be as possible.
[2013-10-10 10:47:01] mehwork: i'm not sure why that would be expected to be an automatic part of the design. It would be very expensive to send an http request that searches every file and every table in our database for a string
[2013-10-10 10:47:08] mehwork: unless i'm misunderstanding
[2013-10-10 10:47:14] Todd: we create all of our assets for each build :/
[2013-10-10 10:47:31] jimevans: mehwork: it'd be a metric crapload cheaper than using the UI.
[2013-10-10 10:47:48] jimevans: and more reliable to boot.
[2013-10-10 10:47:52] Todd: we also have a team which does a db import at the beginning of the build and test based on what's expected to be there
[2013-10-10 10:48:26] mehwork: jimevans: i agree there is somethign that's clearly missing that would make this easier. But maybe it's just my lack of familiarity with all of the app (there's a LOT of content and i'm new to the project)
[2013-10-10 10:48:58] mehwork: and we're a distributed team so it's in my best interest to be able to find stuff on my own, quickly, rather than sending an email asking someone else where something is and wasting their time
[2013-10-10 10:49:34] mehwork: that's why i wish there was a super grep that would be able to login, curl all the pages and grep for the string or something quick
[2013-10-10 10:49:55] Todd: lol wut
[2013-10-10 10:49:57] mehwork: but the content im looking for loads dynamically from a database
[2013-10-10 10:50:02] mehwork: so that wouldnt work
[2013-10-10 10:50:41] jimevans: mehwork: wish i could be more help, but since you're unwilling to provide a sample of what you're up against, i've given you my best suggestions.
[2013-10-10 10:50:54] jimevans: (and yes, i meant "unwilling")

[2013-10-10 10:51:22] jimevans: you don
[2013-10-10 10:51:29] jimevans: you don't have to.
[2013-10-10 10:51:32] Todd: mehwork, I agree. Not enough info. However, it sounds like you're doing something wrong.
[2013-10-10 10:51:37] mehwork: yes i do because you have to login to be able to see anything
[2013-10-10 10:51:49] mehwork: it's alright, thanks for the input
[2013-10-10 10:51:57] jimevans: it's a very very rare case that someone needs the *actual* application. a mockup will almost always work as well.

[2013-10-10 10:53:52] jleyba_: (I realize this is probably a question for AutomatedTester, but I know you've done a lot of testing with it)
[2013-10-10 10:53:53] barancev: jleyba_: not right away
[2013-10-10 10:54:10] barancev: it is still missing some features
[2013-10-10 10:54:16] mehwork: i'm unwilling to put in the time and effort for that. ONLY because i have done stuff like that in the past only to not get an answer and felt annoyed for wating my time. I'll consider it though based off of how important this issue is to me. Thanks
[2013-10-10 10:54:38] mehwork: you have been fair and i appreciate it
[2013-10-10 10:54:44] timbo1, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-10-10 10:55:13] mehwork: i was mostly just wanting to know if someone had an obvious quick answer. If it's something this involved then it's probably not worth pursuing and i'll just do it manually. Sometimes automation isn't more efficient
[2013-10-10 10:55:30] jimevans: mehwork: but in broad terms, if you're dead-set on using webdriver for this, you could scan a page for all existing links, store locators for them, click on one, scan *that* resulting page for links, click the first, and so on, in a classic depth-first search.
[2013-10-10 10:55:49] jimevans: though, the tricky bit is that when you navigate back, you need to re-find your elements again.
[2013-10-10 10:56:15] jimevans: because when your page is rewritten on the navigation, any element references become stale.

[2013-10-10 11:55:06] pquinn80: Page Object question for the WebDriver experts out there- I found that our page classes would often be full of 1 line methods to do simple actions on an element (like click or get text).   So one way I’ve tried to reduce that code is by expose public properties for these items.  The properties are what we called an “Element” object.  Our Element class basically wraps those IWebElements...

[2013-10-10 11:55:09] pquinn80: ...has a limited number of methods like Click and GetText.  We’ll do the FindElement call in those methods (as the PageFactory approach won’t work for us).  Any thoughts on this approach?
[2013-10-10 11:56:20] cgoldberg: mehwork, "i wish there was a super grep that would be able to login, curl all the pages and grep for the string or something quick"   .. sounds like only a few lines of code to me :)
[2013-10-10 11:58:52] mehwork: cgoldberg: not when you have to be logged, and click on links in order for the dom to populate from a database, in for it to work
[2013-10-10 11:59:08] cgoldberg: mehwork.. it's all HTTP meng

[2013-10-10 11:59:55] cgoldberg: there *is* is HTTP API..  it's just built for a web client.. doesn't mean you can't send your own requests with http client
[2013-10-10 12:00:58] cgoldberg: mehwork, you don't need a browser to login , or parse html, or send http requests if that's where you are stuck on
[2013-10-10 12:01:40] mehwork: cgoldberg: i know that much, but there are javascript conditionals, jquery dynamic pages, cookies, and other things involved that makes it more than a few lines of code to write

[2013-10-10 12:03:17] mehwork: i've already gotten some of it done by grepping a mysqldump, but that still doesn't tell me which page in the website i need to navigate to. Which is what i really want to find out. I want to find out that if what i change in the db or file system breaks the actual web page if i don't do it right
[2013-10-10 12:03:35] mehwork: and some of the web pages i know where they are from memory, but some i have no idea. And they require being logged in as a certain user type
[2013-10-10 12:03:35] cgoldberg: mehwork, cookies are easy, but the rest really all needed to send a search query?

[2013-10-10 12:09:40] cgoldberg: mehwork, ok.. so you basically want to spider the app?  and need javascript execution too?  if that's true.. now I see your problem
[2013-10-10 12:10:04] mehwork: yeah
[2013-10-10 12:10:27] cgoldberg: spidering site's is trivial with tools.. but they don't render html or execute javascript
[2013-10-10 12:10:28] cgoldberg: hmm
[2013-10-10 12:10:42] mehwork: that's a good way of putting it, i wish i would have said it that concisely
[2013-10-10 12:11:18] cgoldberg: mehwork.. how many pages are dealing with?  is the number of links limited and the same each time?
[2013-10-10 12:11:21] cgoldberg: or keeps changing?
[2013-10-10 12:12:12] mehwork: changes
[2013-10-10 12:12:24] mehwork: it's a side menu pane with sub links
[2013-10-10 12:12:58] mehwork: i want to simulate clicking on each link and sublink and when my search term is found it tells me exactly what links i have to click to get there (or equivalent)

[2013-10-10 12:15:21] mehwork: an api would definitely be helpful
[2013-10-10 12:15:55] cgoldberg: that's still a very vague answer... why can't you do it in webdriver if you can do it manually?
[2013-10-10 12:16:16] cgoldberg: can this be done manually or no?
[2013-10-10 12:16:22] mehwork: i probably can. I'm ne to webdriver though and mainly came here to ask if it can be done
[2013-10-10 12:16:25] mehwork: it can definitely be done manually
[2013-10-10 12:16:33] cgoldberg: then it can definitely be replicated in webdriver
[2013-10-10 12:16:39] mehwork: but then we got into a discussion about how webdriver is overkil and that an api would be best
[2013-10-10 12:17:07] mehwork: i just need to learn to walk before i try to run
[2013-10-10 12:17:08] cgoldberg: overkill kis another discussion.. it sounds like an easy task.. so try it and see if it meets your needs
[2013-10-10 12:17:22] cgoldberg: how many tests are you planning to run
[2013-10-10 12:17:35] cgoldberg: hundreds of thousands? or a handful?
[2013-10-10 12:17:46] mehwork: cgoldberg: well jimevans was saying it could be difficult i think, because of stale references or something i dont understand yet
[2013-10-10 12:17:50] mehwork: hundreds
[2013-10-10 12:18:01] mehwork: about 700 by my estimation
[2013-10-10 12:18:03] cgoldberg: mehwork, do it in webdriver... the same way you do it mnaually
[2013-10-10 12:18:27] mehwork: do you have a link for where i can start learning this. I have only used selenium once like 4 years ago in firefox and that was just a demo
[2013-10-10 12:18:41] cgoldberg: mehwork, learn webdriver?
[2013-10-10 12:18:56] cgoldberg: what's your language of choice?
[2013-10-10 12:19:07] mehwork: anything high level
[2013-10-10 12:19:20] mehwork: ruby, python, javascript
[2013-10-10 12:19:47] stephend: we've got plenty of python webdriver tests, and some tutorials for stuff
[2013-10-10 12:19:50] stephend: as well as templates
[2013-10-10 12:20:03] cgoldberg: mehwork,  which do you know well and are ready to work in?.. it's not an arbitrary choice
[2013-10-10 12:20:08] cgoldberg: ruby and python are well supported
[2013-10-10 12:20:09] mehwork: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/ the place to start?
[2013-10-10 12:20:24] cgoldberg: but whichever you choose.. read the associated API documentation
[2013-10-10 12:20:36] stephend: mehwork: here's Mozilla Web QA's page on it: https://quality.mozilla.org/teams/web-qa/#Automated
[2013-10-10 12:21:03] stephend: https://github.com/mozilla/mozwebqa-test-templates might help too

[2013-10-10 12:30:09] mehwork: my gf gets harrased at her job and she's just in a normal office environment, not software industry, and no one gets fired there either. So it's probably more of a cultural issue in general
[2013-10-10 12:31:10] mehwork: one guy actually did get fired because he was crossing the line even by apologist standards, and right in front of the boss. And they still told him they were laying him off because of job performance reasons instead of the real reason
[2013-10-10 12:31:29] p_l: mehwork: somehow I have a feeling that such open attitudes are more of an american thing than in many european countries..
[2013-10-10 12:31:32] mehwork: so he gets unemployment benefits and no reason to think he did anything wrong

[2013-10-10 12:39:24] nullx: yeah that's exactly my thought
[2013-10-10 12:39:30] nullx: oh good idea
[2013-10-10 12:39:38] nullx: I've used browsermob before, it's quite easy to use
[2013-10-10 12:39:43] nullx: good thinking.. then I just grab a CSS element
[2013-10-10 12:39:58] cgoldberg: nullx, that will give you detailed timing of all http requests in a pageload
[2013-10-10 12:39:59] nullx: that will definitely work for me
[2013-10-10 12:40:01] nullx: yeah
[2013-10-10 12:40:10] nullx: and I recall I can even find javascript errors through that
[2013-10-10 12:40:34] cgoldberg: but for course grained timing.. you can instrument webdriver code with some timers..
[2013-10-10 12:40:39] nullx: by injecting a javascript that creates stuff
[2013-10-10 12:40:40] nullx: yeah
[2013-10-10 12:40:55] nullx: creates stuff = creating a div with js errors

[2013-10-10 12:42:56] nullx: nice
[2013-10-10 12:44:19] cgoldberg: i do that, plus dump the html source to a file, + get the stack trace from test runner.. gives you decent chance to debug inside Xvfb runs

[2013-10-10 14:31:40] pquinn80: Looks like there’s a little more activity out here now, compared to when I threw this out here earlier today – just wanted a bit of feedback if someone has a minute…
[2013-10-10 14:31:46] pquinn80: Page Object question for the WebDriver experts out there- I found that our page classes would often be full of 1 line methods to do simple actions on an element (like click or get text).   So one way I’ve tried to reduce that code is by expose public properties for these items.  The properties are what we called an “Element” object.  Our Element class basically wraps those IWebElements...
[2013-10-10 14:31:47] pquinn80: ...and...
[2013-10-10 14:31:48] plightbo_work, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-10 14:31:49] pquinn80: ...has a limited number of methods like Click and GetText.  We’ll do the FindElement call in those methods (as the PageFactory approach won’t work for us).  Any thoughts on this approach?
[2013-10-10 14:32:45] AutomatedTester: pquinn80: without seeing it, it sounds fine
[2013-10-10 14:32:55] jimevans: pquinn80: sounds to me like you're using a "page wrapper" pattern. which is fine as far as it goes.
[2013-10-10 14:33:04] AutomatedTester: but then again PO is just a pattern, not a rule
[2013-10-10 14:33:33] pquinn80: cool - we end up using Generics for the Clicks so we can return different pages
[2013-10-10 14:34:25] davidlai: I think exposing elements is a bad idea generally.  but having a bunch of getter methods is annoying.  I prefer to have 1 getPageInfo() method, that returns a dictionary of all the info at once.
[2013-10-10 14:34:41] pquinn80: btw - AutomatedTester & jimevans - nice work on the Se Hangouts  (just got around to watching them today)
[2013-10-10 14:35:04] AutomatedTester: pquinn80: glad you enjoyed them
[2013-10-10 14:35:09] pquinn80: davidlai - when you say "info" what is that?
[2013-10-10 14:35:37] davidlai: pretty much all the text and field information I'd like to do verifications on.
[2013-10-10 14:35:42] jimevans: pquinn80: thanks. sorry i missed the last one. i was on the west coast, and it happened at 7AM, by which i mean i forgot about it.
