[2013-10-16 09:27:58] eldondev: *sigh* "soon" is a tiring time when our team's PRs are blocked on ci being broken in itself.

[2013-10-16 09:31:51] lukeis: there's a lot of different things the browser checks to determine 'loaded' and each browser driver can have it's own rules
[2013-10-16 09:32:15] lukeis: i'm afraid this is not well documented and you'll need to dig into the code to find out

[2013-10-16 12:37:20] seleniumdev07: it is random
[2013-10-16 12:38:04] jimevans: seleniumdev07: i suppose you could try sending an http request to the IE driver, but that's not going to be reliable. i've said it before, that detecting a crash in IEDriverServer.exe is going to be very difficult.

[2013-10-16 12:45:20] jimevans: correct. under the covers, IEDriverServer.exe starts up an http server, which the language binding (java, .NET, ruby, python, etc. - you never said which you were using) uses to communicate with it.

[2013-10-16 14:00:27] jimevans: so the note that chromedriver 2.4 supports chrome 29-32 should be ignored?

[2013-10-16 14:01:06] lukeis: https://saucelabs.com/docs/platforms  lists 29… but doesn't show the difference in desired capabilities between 29 and 27 :-/

[2013-10-16 15:01:35] imphasing: for your windows machines, do you guys have them set up to autologin a user so the console session is active, thereby allowing screenshots to be captures?
[2013-10-16 15:01:50] imphasing: or is there some other magic.. the service account won't allow screenshots since it's not a real session
[2013-10-16 15:02:17] imphasing: so we are forced to autologin a user, but if we remote into that user to view tests it kills the console session, replacing it with an RDP session which kills screenshotting
[2013-10-16 15:03:01] phasze: I used realvnc for a bit, but eventually just opened them all from remote desktop manager
[2013-10-16 15:03:02] imphasing: so basically if you want to view a test run, you can remote in but you then have to restart the box to make screenshot start working again
[2013-10-16 15:03:07] imphasing: hmm
[2013-10-16 15:03:29] imphasing: yeah, either we keep remote desktop manager up on some machine and not minimized, or we never touch the sessions from the auto-logged in user
[2013-10-16 15:03:43] phasze: rdm wouldn't be the best solution for a large structure but if you have that then you probably won't be remoting in
[2013-10-16 15:03:52] imphasing: true
[2013-10-16 15:05:10] phasze: as far as I know selenium doesn't play nice as a service
[2013-10-16 15:05:19] phasze: needs that desktop view
[2013-10-16 15:06:29] imphasing: yeah, I'm starting to feel like I should ditch our windows fleet and just use linux nodes
[2013-10-16 15:06:41] imphasing: but that's not exactly what we want to test anyway

[2013-10-16 22:57:58] barancev: ok, time to upgrade htmlunit :)
[2013-10-16 22:58:12] lukeis: o.0
[2013-10-16 22:58:12] barancev: who cares about htmlunit, but...
[2013-10-16 22:58:15] lukeis: don't you dare
[2013-10-16 22:58:27] lukeis: 2.37 ;)
[2013-10-16 22:59:18] lukeis: FF25 will be out in 13 days
[2013-10-16 22:59:37] barancev: 2.37? no matter. because I have already updated httpclient. what can be worse? :)
[2013-10-16 23:00:33] lukeis: maybe someone who has any skin in using htmlunit should say…  we don't here (well, we include htmlunit independently, so we control the version update of it)

[2013-10-16 23:04:21] barancev: until we drop htmlunit it is reasonable to update it to the latest versions
[2013-10-16 23:04:40] barancev: they got huge progress in the recent year, btw
