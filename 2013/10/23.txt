[2013-10-23 00:33:02] nikiforo: For example, if ExpectedConditions.not(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(locator)) should wait until absence of an element
[2013-10-23 00:33:32] nikiforo: Logically I think the statement correct, but I'm not sure if it works.
[2013-10-23 00:34:31] nikiforo: Actually ExpectedConditions.invisibilityOfElementLocated(locator) does something similar. But I'm not sure...

[2013-10-23 03:36:41] barancev: how many nodes?
[2013-10-23 03:36:57] stephend: 7
[2013-10-23 03:37:03] stephend: well
[2013-10-23 03:37:08] stephend: on Mac Minis, native hosts
[2013-10-23 03:37:15] stephend: plus the 4 or so on Windows machines
[2013-10-23 03:37:18] pavang, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-10-23 03:37:31] stephend: all home-spun, no real ESX(i) to speak of -- yet
[2013-10-23 03:37:37] stephend: although we have a prototype in a DC
[2013-10-23 03:37:47] stephend: and we graciously call out to sauce
[2013-10-23 03:37:55] barancev: tnx!
[2013-10-23 03:38:01] stephend: barancev: we've seen issues with Grid stacking up, so to speak
[2013-10-23 03:38:05] Ardesco: don't have my own grid, thats an overhead I'm not interested in
[2013-10-23 03:38:11] stephend: apparently we run it pretty full-hilt
[2013-10-23 03:38:18] Ardesco: I would use Sauce or BrowserStack if it was needed
[2013-10-23 03:38:21] stephend: we've literally run weeks without a restart
[2013-10-23 03:38:23] barancev: I'll ask saucers specially, how did they build the grid, and how bit it is
[2013-10-23 03:38:32] stephend: but we're told we're "crazy" for doing so :-)
[2013-10-23 03:38:35] barancev: *big
[2013-10-23 03:38:48] Dave_B_: at the mo just 8 nodes, should be 20 shortly
[2013-10-23 03:39:09] stephend: barancev: we purpose-built our pytestmozwebqa plugin to be able to do local/Sauce
[2013-10-23 03:39:51] barancev: I don't want to start a holywar homebrew vs service, just a curiosity :)

[2013-10-23 03:41:49] stephend: ours is out of capacity / scaling

[2013-10-23 07:12:02] jimevans: some days i feel like MSFT is actively working *against* ui-based automation of IE.
[2013-10-23 07:13:09] jimevans: i mean, i know they're actually not, but it does feel that way sometimes.
[2013-10-23 07:13:19] Ardesco: i suspect it's more along the lines of they don't really care either way, even though they know they should
[2013-10-23 07:13:39] Ardesco: and because they don't care they do what's easy, even if it makes automation a bitch
[2013-10-23 07:13:39] jimevans: no, there are people inside the organization who do care.
[2013-10-23 07:14:00] Ardesco: i'm sure there are some that do, but are there enough to make a difference?
[2013-10-23 07:14:03] jimevans: some even in positions with decision-making authority.
[2013-10-23 07:14:41] Ardesco: being able to make a decision is unfortunately not the same as getting all your programmer to believe it's a good one
[2013-10-23 07:14:55] jimevans: it's not the developers who are the issue.
[2013-10-23 07:14:55] Ardesco: and something they should take to heart
[2013-10-23 07:15:01] Ardesco: no?
[2013-10-23 07:15:07] jimevans: these issues are *design* issues.
[2013-10-23 07:15:33] Ardesco: so the developers aren't involved in the design process?
[2013-10-23 07:15:41] jimevans: program managers are the biggest roadblock, because they don't always solicit input from people like me. :)
[2013-10-23 07:15:44] Ardesco: and they aren't pushing back against stupid requirements?
[2013-10-23 07:16:28] Ardesco: even if they don't, that doesn't mean the devs should just agree and not question and push back in an attempt to make things sane
[2013-10-23 07:16:46] jimevans: they're also running up against nearly two decades of questionable decisions in architecture, even at the OS level.
[2013-10-23 07:16:54] Ardesco: passing the buck doesn't help anybody
[2013-10-23 07:16:58] jimevans: and, it's a trade-off.
[2013-10-23 07:17:22] petarm: Dude-X: Thanks so much! I managed to get it to wait wait WebDriverWait... It still couldn't find the element, but that's fixable :).
[2013-10-23 07:17:23] Ardesco: sounds like MS is in pretty bad shape tbh
[2013-10-23 07:17:38] jimevans: i can just as easily make the case that every decision they've made that has made it harder to write and maintain the IE driver were actually *good* decisions with respect to users.
[2013-10-23 07:17:54] jimevans: because honestly, they're mostly security problems.
[2013-10-23 07:18:00] jimevans: or security fixes
[2013-10-23 07:18:32] Ardesco: some light at the end of the tunnel then :)
[2013-10-23 07:18:58] jimevans: for users, yes. for me as a driver maintainer for IE, not really. :)
[2013-10-23 07:19:37] jimevans: and really, at the end of the day, that *should* be who they care about most, their end users.
[2013-10-23 07:21:31] jimevans: but to take an example, a site that's in a protected mode zone and another that's in a non-protected mode zone don't share their cookie store. that's fine. but enhanced protected mode (turned on by default in IE11) adds a *third* option to where cookies are stored.
[2013-10-23 07:23:03] dabos, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-10-23 07:23:27] jimevans: this is actually good for users, because of metro apps, which often rely on cookies for their functionality. it means that IE can't hijack cookies set by a third-party metro app. but it makes the IE driver that much more complex.

[2013-10-23 08:41:42] jimevans: i figure it is.
[2013-10-23 08:42:14] lukeis: you can have multiple emulators / devices  helps to pick which one if you have multiple (i believe)
[2013-10-23 08:42:27] jimevans: so my question is does chromedriver.exe fire up adb? or is that just a switch to let chromedriver know what port adb is listening on for commands?
[2013-10-23 08:42:45] jimevans: lukeis: i guessed it's something like that, but i want to make sure.
[2013-10-23 08:42:47] lukeis: adb is always 'running'
[2013-10-23 08:42:57] lukeis: first command will launch it automatically
[2013-10-23 08:43:22] lukeis: `adb devices`  will list your devices (with ports)

[2013-10-23 11:11:07] daemon: nirvdrum, it starts once and never stops (that test MAY have been restarted, without quitting the driver) but the REAL version of what I am doing is basically a dedicated server created especially for logging and analyzing some web data, it starts up 6 hours in from the frist day of the month, and runs till the end of the month
[2013-10-23 11:11:16] daemon: so no re-use it just runs constantly
[2013-10-23 11:11:18] daemon: for upto 31 days
[2013-10-23 11:11:22] daemon: depending on month
[2013-10-23 11:11:44] nirvdrum: You just have the same XPath expression retained over 4,000 times by the driver.
[2013-10-23 11:12:15] daemon: thats correct, the information is polled from sme horrible javascriptized table
[2013-10-23 11:12:27] daemon: when that information has been collected, (extrapolates id)
[2013-10-23 11:12:33] daemon: the page source is pulled from selenium to the backend
[2013-10-23 11:12:38] daemon: and HTML::TreeBuilder deals with it from thre
[2013-10-23 11:12:44] daemon: but basically even though its looking for the same xpaths
[2013-10-23 11:12:50] daemon: the return from that xpath will alter occastionally
[2013-10-23 11:12:52] nirvdrum: Okay.  Well, my guess is you're going to have problems if you try to reuse the same driver instance for an extended period of time.

[2013-10-23 11:13:30] daemon: the XPATH search is repeated every 5 seconds
[2013-10-23 11:13:52] nirvdrum: So, you have an instance that runs for a month and uses 100 MB RAM and this is cause for alarm? :-P
[2013-10-23 11:14:05] daemon: nirvdrum, it was using 2G after 12 days
[2013-10-23 11:14:12] daemon: it goes up about 10M every .... 15 minutes
[2013-10-23 11:14:15] nirvdrum: Ahh.
[2013-10-23 11:14:20] nirvdrum: So, how long was this running for?
[2013-10-23 11:14:33] daemon: it was either 12 or 20 days -_- sorry for the lapse in memory
[2013-10-23 11:14:39] daemon: it was over a week anyway but no where near its full run time
[2013-10-23 11:14:57] nirvdrum: If it's at 100 MB and it goes up 10 MB every 15 min., it couldn't be that long.

[2013-10-23 11:16:13] nirvdrum: top can be deceiving, too.  The JVM will allocate up to what you specify as the max heap.  It may use less when it GCs, but it likely won't free it back up to the OS.
[2013-10-23 11:16:35] nirvdrum: So that just means at some point it ran at 800 MB, not necessarily that it currently is.
[2013-10-23 11:16:36] daemon: I ran GC manually from visualvm it did nothing
[2013-10-23 11:16:39] nirvdrum: Just as an FYI.

[2013-10-23 11:32:44] daemon: nirvdrum, I wrote a test script for it (in perl ofc)
[2013-10-23 11:32:52] daemon: but its realyl easy to replicate in any language
[2013-10-23 11:32:56] daemon: on any base
[2013-10-23 11:32:58] nirvdrum: Perl and FreeBSD.  It's like you found a time machine.
[2013-10-23 11:33:11] daemon: :D
[2013-10-23 11:33:20] nirvdrum: Let me guess . . . command-line emacs?

[2013-10-23 11:34:15] nicegraham: lukeis: I'm upgrading my laptop to one of the new 13" i7s with 16gb ram and 512 ssd. can't wait.
[2013-10-23 11:34:16] daemon: nirvdrum, ok little bit of a blank moment, I am using firefox (tried esr[17] and now using 24) as they both work identically, for the perl bindings I am using Selenium::Remote::Driver
[2013-10-23 11:34:34] daemon: nirvdrum, https://metacpan.org/pod/Selenium::Remote::Driver
[2013-10-23 11:34:35] nirvdrum: The Firefox part is what I was interested in.
[2013-10-23 11:34:37] daemon: ah
[2013-10-23 11:34:51] lukeis: nicegraham: nice :-D
[2013-10-23 11:35:11] nicegraham: yep, I'm foisting my current one on to some unsuspecting new hire :)
[2013-10-23 11:35:11] daemon: nirvdrum, the test script I wrote is on here: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=6449
[2013-10-23 11:35:19] daemon: its basically jsut a recursive xpath call with no breaks
[2013-10-23 11:35:30] daemon: that stays on the same site domain
[2013-10-23 11:37:21] daemon: nirvdrum, for the freebsd amazon thing http://www.daemonology.net/freebsd-on-ec2/
[2013-10-23 11:38:06] nirvdrum: daemon: That says you need to use Windows instances, still.
[2013-10-23 11:38:11] nirvdrum: Those have a hefty premium.
[2013-10-23 11:38:18] daemon: ah :(
[2013-10-23 11:38:34] nirvdrum: Cluster compute supports HVM, but that's like $2+ / hour.

[2013-10-23 11:44:21] daemon: nirvdrum, any idea how I can hack selenium to not eat so much memory
[2013-10-23 11:44:34] daemon:  a hidden ultra secret -no-log command paramemter or so
[2013-10-23 11:44:41] nirvdrum: No.
[2013-10-23 11:44:52] nirvdrum: If there were, that'd be the default :-P

[2013-10-23 11:45:09] daemon: I take it this is going to take a while to be fixed
[2013-10-23 11:45:12] farlan, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-23 11:46:20] nirvdrum: I was going to have you try something simple, but you can't even build.
[2013-10-23 11:46:26] nirvdrum: So, yeah, that'll take longer :-/
[2013-10-23 11:47:17] daemon: I wonder if I should file that as a bug its self
[2013-10-23 11:47:21] daemon: I meant really it should compile
[2013-10-23 11:47:30] daemon: have you got any idea what that build failure means
[2013-10-23 11:47:32] daemon: maybe its something simple

[2013-10-23 11:49:02] nirvdrum: No idea.  It could just be that our ancient version of JRuby has problems with FreeBSD.
[2013-10-23 11:49:46] daemon: hmm I thoguht you guys where all java
[2013-10-23 11:49:53] admc, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-10-23 11:50:10] nirvdrum: CrazyFunBuild is basically rake.
[2013-10-23 11:50:29] nirvdrum: We bundle JRuby, so all you need is a JVM.
[2013-10-23 11:50:32] daemon: ah
[2013-10-23 11:50:47] jimevans: all java?!?!
[2013-10-23 11:50:52] daemon: will it matter that there is no ruby compiler on my system at all
[2013-10-23 11:50:55] *jimevans stifles guffaws'
[2013-10-23 11:51:11] nirvdrum: daemon: No.  We ship JRuby in the repo.
[2013-10-23 11:51:16] daemon: gotcha
[2013-10-23 11:51:37] nirvdrum: There's a branch out there to replace with a newer version of JRuby.  But I have no idea what happened with that.
[2013-10-23 11:51:42] nirvdrum: jarib: ^ ?
[2013-10-23 11:52:02] rebelagentm, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-10-23 11:52:06] daemon: found the problem I think
[2013-10-23 11:52:36] nirvdrum: Anyway, I need to get some other work done.  If you can't pull up a VM to build, I'll try to get something together soon.  But honestly, it'd be a lot faster if you could build since your env is the one that this is reproducible in.

[2013-10-23 11:53:37] daemon: nirvdrum, actually it should be repeatable in any
[2013-10-23 11:53:52] jarib: nirvdrum: i never got that finished
[2013-10-23 11:54:06] nirvdrum: daemon: And yet I'm not seeing the problem, which is partially why it's not been resolved.
[2013-10-23 11:54:06] jarib: i think i got it more or less working
[2013-10-23 11:54:25] daemon: nirvdrum, you have to leave it running a fair while
[2013-10-23 11:54:30] nirvdrum: daemon: Not to be trite, but I could fiddle around and try to reproduce, or we could use a system where it's known to be failing.
[2013-10-23 11:54:30] jarib: but not properly tested on windows etc.
[2013-10-23 11:54:40] daemon: nirvdrum, oh I just found something interesting
[2013-10-23 11:54:42] nirvdrum: jarib: JRuby 1.7.6 is out now.
[2013-10-23 11:55:04] daemon: nirvdrum, I no longer have the problem either, java does GC at 70% utilization of heap, it jsut got to 70% of heap size
[2013-10-23 11:55:31] daemon: http://i.imgur.com/TGDWcmA.png

[2013-10-23 11:55:46] jarib: nirvdrum: it's great that you're volunteering :)
[2013-10-23 11:56:07] daemon: oh
[2013-10-23 11:56:10] daemon: the test program crashed

[2013-10-23 11:56:35] nirvdrum: jarib: I could take a crack.  I didn't know if it was abandoned because Simon's rewriting the build system again.
