[2013-10-31 06:50:32] jimevans: koshie_: hi.
[2013-10-31 06:51:13] koshie_: I've a field which is unaccessible: I try to match it by id but it says there is no element matching it. It's a window into a page generate by JS code. I've opened the window and now I'm trying to use: Input Text   id=id_of_the_element   whatINeedToWrite
[2013-10-31 06:51:29] koshie_: I've copy/paste the name of the id, just to be sure.
[2013-10-31 06:51:56] koshie_: Plus I've from chromium copied the xpath and tried with it xpath=thexpath... but it doesn't works :/
[2013-10-31 06:52:03] koshie_: An idea?
[2013-10-31 06:52:26] jimevans: first thing i'd look for is whether the element is in a frame/iframe
[2013-10-31 06:52:47] koshie_: Newbie question: how can I check that?
[2013-10-31 06:53:12] jimevans: does the xpath you get from chromium include frame or iframe anywhere in it?
[2013-10-31 06:54:02] koshie_:  //*[@id="the_xpath"]
[2013-10-31 06:54:05] koshie_: this is what I get
[2013-10-31 06:54:16] jimevans: ah. so that's no help then.
[2013-10-31 06:54:21] koshie_: ?
[2013-10-31 06:54:33] Dave_B_: is it on a page we can see or private?
[2013-10-31 06:54:40] jimevans: you'll just need to inspect the element in question and see if there's a frame somewhere in there.
[2013-10-31 06:54:41] koshie_: it is private, plus not mine
[2013-10-31 06:55:05] koshie_: I'm just doing a demonstration of RF+Selenium for a friend and his company.

[2013-10-31 06:56:40] koshie_: He explained this: It's a div generated by JS
[2013-10-31 06:56:48] koshie_: with an Ajax call
[2013-10-31 06:57:11] koshie_: Well, the div is created by Ajax call
[2013-10-31 06:57:15] jimevans: okay, then you may need to wait until the element is there before finding it. there are a couple of ways you can do this.
[2013-10-31 06:57:24] koshie_: An other sleep I guess
[2013-10-31 06:57:51] koshie_: oh well

[2013-10-31 08:07:58] dimacus: he says you can stream browser window onlyâ€¦ if that's trueâ€¦ it would be possible to stream 2 videos independently even if browser is on top of another

[2013-10-31 10:55:19] simonstewart: So, what are our options (and "removing native events entirely" isn't an option)
[2013-10-31 10:55:52] jleyba: It'd be great if we could call into Marionette through XPCOM (AutomatedTester ping)
[2013-10-31 10:56:07] barancev: btw, synthesized events are trusted enough atm
[2013-10-31 10:56:19] jleyba: that would actually help with long term migration - start replacing functionality with marionette
[2013-10-31 10:56:48] barancev: al least mouse events
[2013-10-31 10:57:15] barancev: they are implemented via  nsIDOMWindowUtils

[2013-10-31 10:59:01] jleyba: Yes, got side tracked. Just pointing out that the events don't need to actually be OS-level
[2013-10-31 10:59:12] barancev: +1

[2013-10-31 11:02:40] barancev: if this is true we can raise an issue on mozilla
[2013-10-31 11:04:34] barancev: after scrolling is implemented we can make synthesized events "more native"

[2013-10-31 11:05:44] jleyba: barancev: My understanding is sendNativeMouseEvent doesn't work - which is why we're not using it now
[2013-10-31 11:05:51] jleyba: But I'd have to track down eranm to find out the details
[2013-10-31 11:06:20] barancev: it was just a side note
[2013-10-31 11:06:33] barancev: I don't think we should do them "more native"
[2013-10-31 11:06:54] barancev: sendMouseEventToWindow works well
[2013-10-31 11:08:15] jleyba: I wonder if that works with :hover

[2013-10-31 11:12:27] manoj9788, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-31 11:12:48] simonstewart: The discussion at hand being "how are we going to improve the lot of native events on firefox, specifically on linux?"
[2013-10-31 11:12:56] barancev: right
[2013-10-31 11:13:20] jimevans: fwiw, marionette uses IDOMWindowUtils as its event pushing mechanism, iirc.
[2013-10-31 11:13:22] simonstewart: We should see whether AutomatedTester or ato can enable us to call the Marionette underpinnings for those before m-day
[2013-10-31 11:13:23] selbot2: M-Day: day in the future when Marionette is made available for non-debug builds
[2013-10-31 11:13:41] barancev: simonstewart: and 2) should it be the default mode on windows
[2013-10-31 11:13:55] jimevans: unless i've grossly misunderstood and/or something's changed since i last looked.
[2013-10-31 11:15:37] simonstewart: I think native events should be the default mode everywhere
[2013-10-31 11:15:49] simonstewart: It is on chrome already
[2013-10-31 11:15:52] simonstewart: And IE
[2013-10-31 11:15:57] simonstewart: Firefox is the odd-man-out
[2013-10-31 11:16:22] jleyba: simonstewart my position is the synthesized events are "good enough" and eliminate a lot of complexity in the code
[2013-10-31 11:16:50] simonstewart: jleyba: only because it was such a royal PITA to get native events working properly on firefox
[2013-10-31 11:16:58] jimevans: sevaseva: wait! i need the current CI results!
[2013-10-31 11:17:14] jleyba: Since the FirefoxDriver runs in a privileged context, you can do more with synthesized events than you can in other browsers
[2013-10-31 11:17:27] simonstewart: If there were a simple way to get stable native events on firefox, we should use it :)
[2013-10-31 11:17:56] jimevans: ah dammit

[2013-10-31 11:24:31] umaar: So for: browser.findElement(webdriver.By.css('.non-existant-selector')).then(success, err) it looks like the argument passed to the function 'err' doesn't really contain selector information...however

[2013-10-31 12:04:19] dimacus: for the most part i've seen it has been 1:1 100% of the time
[2013-10-31 12:04:31] dimacus: but i don't want to write code that assumes 1:1 and breaks
[2013-10-31 12:04:35] jleyba: jimevans normally pushes IEDriver.exe when the main jar is updated, but he'll also push bug fixes as needed
[2013-10-31 12:05:21] SamuraiJack, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-31 12:05:28] jleyba: e.g. there was a IEDriver 2.35.3
[2013-10-31 12:06:42] dimacus: gotcha
[2013-10-31 12:07:16] dimacus: jleyba:  ok how about thisâ€¦ is there a script or something to push new versions out?
[2013-10-31 12:07:20] dimacus: or is it uploaded by hand?
[2013-10-31 12:07:38] jleyba: umm... i think it's ./go release
[2013-10-31 12:07:55] dimacus: i wonder if i can attach a new json file to the http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list page
[2013-10-31 12:08:10] dimacus: that has the current versions, and when ./go release is called that file is auto updated
[2013-10-31 12:08:28] dimacus: this way there is 1 Json API(ish) end point to know the latest version of everything
[2013-10-31 12:08:31] dimacus: thoughts?
[2013-10-31 12:09:21] jleyba: I could see that getting out of sync pretty easily if someone manually updates one of the components
[2013-10-31 12:09:42] dimacus: yeah that's what i wanna avoid

[2013-10-31 12:14:10] jleyba: umaar: Basically what's happening is your callback intercepts the error before it makes it to the control flow
[2013-10-31 12:14:31] jleyba: so it never gets annotated with async stacktrace
[2013-10-31 12:15:23] umaar: jleyba: Ah that would explain tings, would you consider that a bug? I imagine others may run into a similar problem
[2013-10-31 12:15:49] jleyba: I think I know how to fix it
[2013-10-31 12:16:34] jleyba: fwiw you can use webdriver.promise.controlFlow().annotateError()
[2013-10-31 12:16:34] jleyba: http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/javascript/class_webdriver_promise_ControlFlow.html#annotateError
[2013-10-31 12:16:40] umaar: *things. The fix, would it be something like the control flow executing error callbacks and passing the async stack track as part of the argument ?
[2013-10-31 12:17:31] umaar: Interesting, didn't know about annotateError()
[2013-10-31 12:17:53] jleyba: It's not really intended for public use, but that's where the information gets added

[2013-10-31 12:48:01] dimacus: jimevans:  nm jleyba already answered this for me
[2013-10-31 12:48:08] jimevans: dimacus: heh. good.
[2013-10-31 12:48:35] jimevans: no matter when we release a selenium jar, i always release a sync'ed IE driver.
[2013-10-31 12:48:56] dimacus: just trying to figure out a good way to stay up to date on all stuff programatically without resorting to screen scraping the downloads page

[2013-10-31 12:50:15] dimacus: but that's only jarâ€¦ does that include IEdriver.exe and ChromeDriver.exe?

[2013-10-31 12:50:29] operatiay, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-31 12:50:30] jimevans1: iedriverserver.exe is checked into the prebuilts directory.

[2013-10-31 12:50:47] dimacus: hmmmm
[2013-10-31 12:50:52] dimacus: sounds tempting
[2013-10-31 12:50:59] jimevans1: (which will include point-releases)
[2013-10-31 12:51:02] dimacus: poll the github prebuild dir?
[2013-10-31 12:51:21] jimevans1: no need to poll for it.
[2013-10-31 12:51:30] jimevans1: or are you wanting to auto-update based on some trigger?
[2013-10-31 12:51:35] dimacus: bingo
[2013-10-31 12:51:40] jimevans1: ah.
[2013-10-31 12:51:44] jimevans1: well that's different then
[2013-10-31 12:51:45] dimacus: auto update of jar, exes for ie and chrome
[2013-10-31 12:52:02] dimacus: that way when you have 300 nodes you don't have to update 1 at the time
[2013-10-31 12:52:40] lukeis: nodes on jenkins?
[2013-10-31 12:52:46] dimacus: not really
[2013-10-31 12:53:02] dimacus: seperate gridâ€¦ that tests on jenkins happen to connet to
[2013-10-31 12:53:03] lukeis: okâ€¦ then you should look at puppet or chef or similar
[2013-10-31 12:53:10] jleyba: dimacus: you could have your nodes pull from some central location you control
[2013-10-31 12:53:23] jleyba: drop the IEDriver there and the nodes will pick it up

[2013-10-31 12:53:35] dimacus: hmmm
[2013-10-31 12:53:46] dimacus: that might be a pretty good solution
[2013-10-31 12:54:25] jimevans1: that'd be a not-too-bad way to go.
[2013-10-31 12:54:27] lukeis: source control is a pretty easy way to accomplish thisâ€¦. (what we do)
[2013-10-31 12:54:34] jimevans1, changing nick to jimevans.
[2013-10-31 12:54:55] dimacus: checking in EXEs into source control is not overly efficient though
[2013-10-31 12:54:57] jimevans: is there a github feed?
[2013-10-31 12:55:00] paulschreiber, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-31 12:55:22] jimevans: because, y'know, if so, you could use that feed for the IEDriverServer.exe checkins.

[2013-10-31 12:56:27] dimacus: that would work pretty well actually
[2013-10-31 12:57:09] jimevans: probably easier than trying to ping the google code git repository
[2013-10-31 12:58:04] dimacus: so now if i can get chrome driver figured out in same way, i'm set :)
[2013-10-31 12:58:30] dimacus: chromedriver.exe that is
[2013-10-31 12:59:15] jimevans: i trust you've got the .jar update worked out?
[2013-10-31 12:59:44] dimacus: not yet
[2013-10-31 13:00:17] dimacus: so far it's literalry
[2013-10-31 13:00:17] dimacus: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list
[2013-10-31 13:00:21] jimevans: i still think an intermediary solution where you push an update from the official repos would give you more control
[2013-10-31 13:00:41] dimacus: and screen scrame for \d\.\d+\.\d+\.zip
[2013-10-31 13:00:51] dimacus: yeah i can see that

[2013-10-31 13:30:51] AutomatedTester: :note simonstewart Marionette uses nsIDOMWindowUtils under the hood which gives us trusted events in the browser. Trusted events are events injected into the event loop so when the browser fires them it doesnt know the difference between them and pure native events from a keyboard for example. Only touch has been implemented so far for advanced actions.
[2013-10-31 13:30:51] selbot2: AutomatedTester: note from simonstewart about 2 hours ago: are the marionette extensions for user interactions available via xpcom in recent firefoxen?

[2013-10-31 13:31:04] phasze: ah

[2013-10-31 13:36:44] AutomatedTester: jleyba: we use it on FirefoxOS and currently allows us to test Mozilla Persona since that requires trusted events

[2013-10-31 18:03:57] dogarrhea: so grid should be installed on each machine that you want to tst on
[2013-10-31 18:04:53] AutomatedTester: the selenium server should be run on those machines
[2013-10-31 18:04:58] AutomatedTester: installed is a strong word
[2013-10-31 18:05:54] dogarrhea: hrm i guess how tight the integration into the actual Grid product I would like to be is how strong I should "install" it
[2013-10-31 18:06:13] dogarrhea: if it's just sending http requests over a network to start things on remote servers then...
[2013-10-31 18:06:41] dogarrhea: somehow the instructions here: http://www.aptude.com/it/easyblog/entry/selenium-grid-tutorial-steps-to-setup-install-configure-and-execute imply that there is some tight integration etween the hub's grid and all 4 machines grids
[2013-10-31 18:07:06] dogarrhea: the prerequisites specifically state "All the environments should have Java, Ant and Grid."
[2013-10-31 18:07:24] AutomatedTester: should have java is the only prerequisite
[2013-10-31 18:08:32] dogarrhea: so it would just be installing server and somehow sending "start selenium_server using blah blah browser"
