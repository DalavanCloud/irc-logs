[2013-10-15 06:42:20] jimevans: nearly two and a half
[2013-10-15 06:43:54] StephenBuckley: hmm
[2013-10-15 06:44:19] jimevans: i'd assume twitter's bot detection has gotten tons better since then.
[2013-10-15 06:44:43] StephenBuckley: I did like 5 searches for a term and just blocked tha account
[2013-10-15 06:45:01] StephenBuckley: I was suitably impressed
[2013-10-15 06:45:31] StephenBuckley: but I think you could do a network of bots, each of which searches and posts a limited amount, as long as they share a common DB
[2013-10-15 06:45:54] hardliner_: Parabola: but it's better for competing in search engines market
[2013-10-15 06:46:06] hardliner_: Parabola: better for end user
[2013-10-15 06:46:38] hardliner_: Parabola: Do you think google didn't use another search engines issuance?
[2013-10-15 06:46:47] hardliner_: Parabola: i don't think so
[2013-10-15 06:47:15] Parabola: i do not believe that at any time google was stealing results from other search engines, and providing them under their site
[2013-10-15 06:47:46] StephenBuckley: hardliner_: even if they did, it's unethical
[2013-10-15 06:47:59] StephenBuckley: the entire point of ethics is that you don't say "but everyone ELSE is doing it!"
[2013-10-15 06:47:59] Parabola: he makes a good point
[2013-10-15 06:48:02] barancev|2: jimevans: you told *today*?
[2013-10-15 06:48:02] Parabola: its not okay for anyone to do that

[2013-10-15 06:48:58] StephenBuckley: jimevans: how could you?
[2013-10-15 06:49:09] barancev|2: jimevans: reporters write bad reports everyday :)
[2013-10-15 06:49:09] Parabola: hardliner_: if you're doing for personal use only, with no financial gain from their work, ie, for a class assignment, i'd personally not feel too bad about it
[2013-10-15 06:49:31] Parabola: however if this is for work, or any publicly available project, i'd not do it
[2013-10-15 06:49:32] barancev|2: but today you're first to see the tracker :)
[2013-10-15 06:49:32] jimevans: barancev|2: ah. right. but i'm just grumpy about it today. :)
[2013-10-15 06:49:38] StephenBuckley: Parabola: hardliner_: yeah, as long as this is a private, not-for-private script, whatever
[2013-10-15 06:50:04] StephenBuckley: problem is we have no way of knowing that you're doing something like that when we give you advice...
[2013-10-15 06:50:54] hardliner_: so you don't know anything about how google improved their results+

[2013-10-15 06:52:35] helpcrypto: we are in need of testing web apps that involve using java applets.
[2013-10-15 06:52:40] StephenBuckley: wow
[2013-10-15 06:52:45] StephenBuckley: hardliner_: it's a war?
[2013-10-15 06:52:48] jimevans: webdriver is the absolute worst way to scrape information like search engine results.
[2013-10-15 06:52:52] StephenBuckley: hahah
[2013-10-15 06:52:53] StephenBuckley: true
[2013-10-15 06:52:54] hardliner_: jimevans: there was no webdriver
[2013-10-15 06:53:16] helpcrypto: at first sight, selenium seems to be ok for that need, but ill like to know if any of you already make this kind of tests, and if having troubles
[2013-10-15 06:53:25] noahsussman, quitting. (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[2013-10-15 06:53:36] jimevans: helpcrypto: unfortunately, selenium won't give you any help with the applets.
[2013-10-15 06:53:58] hardliner_: webdriver was developed in google
[2013-10-15 06:54:03] hardliner_: later
[2013-10-15 06:54:05] jimevans: you likely won't be able to manipulate anything inside the applet container at all.
[2013-10-15 06:54:24] jimevans: hardliner_: you hardly need to lecture me on the history of the webdriver project.
[2013-10-15 06:54:48] StephenBuckley: helpcrypto: you'd have to do pixel-clicking, which would be really really brittle-- any change at all in the applet would likely break your whole test suite
[2013-10-15 06:54:50] helpcrypto: will selenium be able to invoke javascript methods?
[2013-10-15 06:55:27] jimevans: helpcrypto: should do. i'd recommend the webdriver api, and not using selenium ide for this project.
[2013-10-15 06:55:59] helpcrypto: the project could be big enough for grid, cause we need many combinations of os-browser
[2013-10-15 06:56:13] StephenBuckley: helpcrypto: sounds like grid, alright!
[2013-10-15 06:56:31] helpcrypto: can selenium invoke local scripts, such .sh/.vbs?
[2013-10-15 06:56:33] StephenBuckley: but you should get a proof-of-concept test off the ground before you worry too much about setting up the whole grid
[2013-10-15 06:57:02] jimevans: helpcrypto: no, that's outside the scope of selenium.
[2013-10-15 06:57:06] hardliner_: microsoft stealed graphical interface - that's not ethical!
[2013-10-15 06:57:20] hardliner_: many companies steal ideas from another
[2013-10-15 06:57:21] jimevans: hardliner_: s/microsoft/apple/
[2013-10-15 06:57:24] jimevans: there i fixed it for you.
[2013-10-15 06:57:39] hardliner_: oooh sorry that's not ethical
[2013-10-15 06:58:02] barancev|2: jimevans: both did :)
[2013-10-15 06:58:03] StephenBuckley: hardliner_: your moral relativism, while inspiring in its delusions of grandeur, is not likely to win you support here
[2013-10-15 06:58:27] jimevans: barancev|2: yeah, but apple did it first! :)
[2013-10-15 06:58:33] barancev|2: right
[2013-10-15 06:58:41] StephenBuckley: Pirates of Silicon Valley?
[2013-10-15 06:58:50] hardliner_: so don't help any microsoft or apple developer
[2013-10-15 06:58:51] jimevans: people seem to forget that. xerox parc was an amazing place.
[2013-10-15 06:58:52] helpcrypto: so...if im not wrong, if i want to test applets, only 2 ways are possible: using javascript to invoke javascript function that calls applet, or using fixed positions/coords/pixel...?
[2013-10-15 06:59:24] jimevans: hardliner_: you're either being deliberately obtuse, or you're being disingenuous.
[2013-10-15 07:00:14] jimevans: the position isn't, "don't help people from companies who have done or are doing unethical things", it's "don't help anyone do anything unethical right now."
[2013-10-15 07:00:19] jimevans: and i suspect you know that.
[2013-10-15 07:00:38] hardliner_: jimevans: lol, i will make my work without your help, i don't heed it)
[2013-10-15 07:01:14] hardliner_: jimevans: i'm just talking about reality
[2013-10-15 07:01:18] jimevans: i'm sure you will. and that's fine. i wish i could talk you out of it, but that's a waste of time.

[2013-10-15 09:45:12] jleyba: jimevans: yt?
[2013-10-15 09:45:22] jleyba: is this the pause interaction?
[2013-10-15 09:45:23] AutomatedTester: barancev: you notice how irc != mailing list

[2013-10-15 09:46:11] *barancev is looking for maillist address'
[2013-10-15 09:46:21] AutomatedTester: and agreed by the w3c meeting
[2013-10-15 09:46:37] AutomatedTester: barancev: use the selenium mailing list
[2013-10-15 09:46:41] AutomatedTester: thats fine
[2013-10-15 09:46:48] barancev: ok
[2013-10-15 09:47:02] AutomatedTester: just not on IRC
[2013-10-15 09:47:23] AutomatedTester: I guess java can call it pause but the remote end will be called wait()
[2013-10-15 09:47:26] barancev: jleyba: yes, pause interaction
[2013-10-15 09:47:47] AutomatedTester: its like .NET can't use get() it has to use navigate.to()
[2013-10-15 09:47:48] therealfakemoot: Is there some mechanism I can use with Selenium to ask a browswer driven by the WebDriver for the list of 'external resources' on a page? CSS and JS links, images, etc?
[2013-10-15 09:47:53] jleyba: I vote -1 on adding a Thread.sleep to our core API

[2013-10-15 09:49:16] jleyba: the actions chain builder should have a method to insert custom actions
[2013-10-15 09:49:24] jleyba: users can use that for sleep() or waitUntil(condition)
[2013-10-15 09:49:38] barancev: actions.moveToElement(el1).waitUntil(visibilityOf(el2)).moveToElement(el2).click()

[2013-10-15 09:50:17] jleyba: AutomatedTester: <3
[2013-10-15 09:50:17] barancev: especially it is important to NOT break the action chain if you use modifier keys
[2013-10-15 09:50:36] barancev: AutomatedTester: so what?
[2013-10-15 09:50:57] barancev: we can implement waitFor on the browser side, like we did with implicit waits
[2013-10-15 09:51:08] barancev: waitUntil
[2013-10-15 09:51:11] AutomatedTester: barancev: so expand visibilityOf as a remote call
[2013-10-15 09:51:28] barancev: I see you point

[2013-10-15 09:52:09] selbot2: ok!
[2013-10-15 09:52:20] barancev: so sleep is the best we can suggest
[2013-10-15 09:52:53] barancev: because breaking the action chain releases modifies keys
[2013-10-15 09:53:02] barancev: *modifier
[2013-10-15 09:53:22] jleyba: no it doesn't

[2013-10-15 09:56:34] jleyba: Action sequences should *not* automatically release the keys
[2013-10-15 09:56:49] jleyba: interactions api is "do as i say".  if you don't release the key, it should stay down

[2013-10-15 10:16:50] phasze: vascobnunes: I've found that behavior to be finicky.  As a result in some of my tests I have it hover and others I just execute a javascript command to make it visible or fake a hover.
[2013-10-15 10:17:05] eldondev: (Because my choices appear to be 20.0 or 24.0 for firefox in apt)
[2013-10-15 10:18:07] eldondev: It appears that firefox is failing to close gracefully, and selenium-server is hanging as a result.
[2013-10-15 10:18:57] eldondev: Anybody have any hints as to why this might be happening?

[2013-10-15 11:06:00] jleyba: My understanding is WebElement.click() attempts to scroll the element into view.  So this error message means it does the scrolling, but the middle of the element still isn't visible, so IE can't click?

[2013-10-15 11:19:09] cgoldberg: barancev, i might be misremembering, but does it do anything beyond sending single static url's? (cookies, dom parsing, sub-requests, etc)
[2013-10-15 11:20:09] cgoldberg: ... it made using it for something beyond a very simple unauthenticated API pretty damn hard.
[2013-10-15 11:20:24] barancev: cgoldberg: iirc, to validate results it uses necko parser, like htmlunit, and some JS engine to check for JS errors on the page
[2013-10-15 11:20:55] barancev: as a "browser" it is even worse than htmlunit
[2013-10-15 11:21:18] barancev: that has significant progress in the last year
[2013-10-15 11:22:07] cgoldberg: barancev, so if you need to parse content and run JS.. i'd prefer PhantomJS/Webdriver

[2013-10-15 13:16:34] StephenBuckley: wow
[2013-10-15 13:16:37] p_l: I knew that it was broken (because Unity breaks applications by hijacking X-server's job), but afaik no one is willing to support Mir
[2013-10-15 13:17:08] p_l: to the point of the darling of idiotic Linux display software, Intel, deliberately thrown out code to support Mir
[2013-10-15 13:17:14] eldondev: Speaking of ubuntu, any thought on when the selenium that supports firefox 24 will drop?

[2013-10-15 13:21:51] p_l: cgoldberg: so, Embrace, Extend, Extinguish

[2013-10-15 13:22:37] cgoldberg: p_l, it vitally matters, but community matters as well.. that's strong
[2013-10-15 13:22:43] p_l: it's deliberate destruction of compatibility using powerful position on the market
[2013-10-15 13:22:55] p_l: (no, not everything uses GTK and QT)
[2013-10-15 13:23:02] cgoldberg: p_l, dead wrong.. sorry it appears like such to you
[2013-10-15 13:23:38] p_l: cgoldberg: the same can be said about systemd, especially since you can describe the current strategy for udev developement as "use systemd or die"
[2013-10-15 13:24:12] cgoldberg: p_l, Upstart works great and is well tested :)
[2013-10-15 13:24:35] p_l: cgoldberg: except that future udev changes will be written with systemd-only in mind
[2013-10-15 13:24:47] p_l: this is the same approach as I see with Wayland and Mir
[2013-10-15 13:25:01] p_l: a Linux edition of UNIX Wars, except with less compatibility
[2013-10-15 13:25:52] cgoldberg: this, unfortunately, there is disruption and fragmentation from time to time... but that can often be good, as long as all technology is open and free.. UNIX wars were totally different because everything was licensed and proprietary

[2013-10-15 14:21:03] eldondev: Like, is that something that will eventually be integrated into the core of the selenium server?
[2013-10-15 14:21:08] jimevans: eldondev: the executable, you mean? to make it easier for language bindings.
[2013-10-15 14:21:27] eldondev: Hmmm?
[2013-10-15 14:21:46] jimevans: directly poking at the chrome remote debugging protocol is not trivial.
[2013-10-15 14:22:04] eldondev: Right, but neither is the firefox addon stuff, right?
[2013-10-15 14:22:11] eldondev: And that's in core?
[2013-10-15 14:22:24] jleyba: eldondev not for much longer
[2013-10-15 14:22:43] jimevans: and it won't be when mozilla delivers its internal driver implementation (marionette)
[2013-10-15 14:22:50] eldondev: Ah, ok.
[2013-10-15 14:23:07] md--, quitting. (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[2013-10-15 14:23:19] eldondev: So firefox will have the equivalent of a --remote-debug-port or whatever the flag is?
[2013-10-15 14:23:36] jimevans: eldondev: something like that yes.
[2013-10-15 14:23:56] jimevans: it'll actually be a command-line switch coupled with some profile settings.
[2013-10-15 14:24:22] jimevans: and they will be providing a shim for that as well.
[2013-10-15 14:24:23] andreastt: jimevans speaks the truth.

[2013-10-15 14:24:37] eldondev: Ok, well, that makes sense,
[2013-10-15 14:24:43] andreastt: The goal of the Selenium project is for the browser vendors to take responsibility for the driver implementations.
[2013-10-15 14:25:03] eldondev: I see.
[2013-10-15 14:25:10] jimevans: but their wire protocol is much, much simpler than the chrome remote debugging protocol. it mirrors the webdriver wire protocol very closely, so is pretty trivial to implement natively.
[2013-10-15 14:25:42] eldondev: When you say "their" you mean firefox?
[2013-10-15 14:25:57] jimevans: yes. the marionette wire protocol from mozilla.

[2013-10-15 14:28:16] jimevans: andreastt: not *entirely* true. the spec has a bit in it that specifies implementers should provide a shim using http as the transport.
[2013-10-15 14:28:36] jimevans: but that's not the project, i suppose, so technically you're right.
[2013-10-15 14:28:38] andreastt: Well, true.  Recent addition.
[2013-10-15 14:28:39] mmm3, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-10-15 14:29:14] eldondev: I guess my fear is that potentially the implementers could have buggy or half-hearted implementations of the spec,
[2013-10-15 14:29:44] eldondev: And then rather than trying to debug 2 things (firefox & selenium) I have to debug 3 things (firefox & shim & selenium)
[2013-10-15 14:30:45] jimevans: eldondev: that's the risk you run, i suppose, but remember that webdriver is in the process of becoming a w3c standard, so if standards compliance is important to the vendor, they *have* to implement the spec properly.
[2013-10-15 14:31:00] jimevans: if they don't care, then you can raise holy hell with the vendor.

[2013-10-15 15:46:05] lukeis: i think it's more proper to copy like that
[2013-10-15 15:46:18] lukeis: but the http server should still be more responsive / actually work

[2013-10-15 15:51:10] lukeis: that means it only grabs the latest build version, so yeah, there could be a problem with a second 'newer' build than initially intended
[2013-10-15 15:51:12] sevaseva: I'm not entirely sure how it worked before , just trying to figure that out, so...

[2013-10-15 15:51:52] lukeis: but we don't actually use it like that, typically we don't care and it should just build with the latest tgz
[2013-10-15 15:53:34] sevaseva: I don;t fully understand. did you mean to say 'typically we don;'t care and it should just build with *any* tgz'? Or.. what do we not care about?
[2013-10-15 15:55:04] lukeis: with this setup if two checkins happen closely together, build all will be run twice. the first will finish first and kick off all the browser tests, but then the second build all will finish and at some point the browser tests kicked off from the first build will pick up the tgz from the second build (but that is what I don't think we care about)
[2013-10-15 15:55:47] lukeis: don't care  /  don't mind that it happens

[2013-10-15 15:58:03] sevaseva: i think that http://ci.seleniumhq.org/selenium-trunk-r$svnrevision.tgz that slaves wget should be placed there by 'build all' task (that runs on master). right..?

[2013-10-15 19:19:56] kudakje: hello.  I want to generalize some simple Selenium tests I wrote in Python for Firefox so they can be used with Chrome and IE.  Would it be good to just have command line options for the Python files and load the indicated webdriver?  Or is there a better approach to cross-browser Selenium tests?
[2013-10-15 19:20:10] Dude-X, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-15 19:20:31] kudakje: tl;dr How do you write simple, cross-browser Selenium tests for running on a desktop machine?

[2013-10-15 19:23:22] p_l: kudakje: good selectors, then arranging the tests to run in order
[2013-10-15 19:23:40] Dude-X: run in order?
[2013-10-15 19:24:01] Dude-X: last work place, our tests ran randomly, we had some hooks to make automation easier
[2013-10-15 19:24:24] p_l: Dude-X: I meant avoiding running more than one test on the single machine, just in case some events get crazy
[2013-10-15 19:24:30] kudakje: Dude-X, p_l: Thanks.  Is there a preferred way to choose which browser to run the tests for?  Like on Linux I don't have Internet Explorer.
[2013-10-15 19:24:36] Dude-X: oh that
[2013-10-15 19:24:50] p_l: kudakje: your tests can request specific capabilities etc.
[2013-10-15 19:25:08] p_l: with Selenium Server/Grid it would apropriately chose from the nodes available, afaik
[2013-10-15 19:25:36] Dude-X: personally i'd recommend you standardize on firefox; IE is fine, but the other browsers tend to have buggy drivers
[2013-10-15 19:25:58] p_l: Well, I'd say you should test on what you're actually going to support
[2013-10-15 19:26:21] Dude-X: that too is also a considerateion
[2013-10-15 19:26:32] p_l: it makes no sense to standardize on firefox if the tested software will be majorly used under IE
[2013-10-15 19:26:53] kudakje: yes, I was hoping to use the tests to make sure things work/look OK in IE
[2013-10-15 19:27:35] kudakje: I guess all my tests can take a command-line option for IE, Firefox, or Chrome
[2013-10-15 19:27:49] kudakje: and load the appropriate webdriver accordingly

[2013-10-15 20:29:27] sevaseva: hm, I'll try to find something related to that.. I went through entire startup/setup script on that machine but don't remember lsof
[2013-10-15 20:30:10] lukeis: maybe daniel did it manually? :-/ http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Publish%20test%20web%20pages/configure
[2013-10-15 20:30:40] sevaseva: I'll ask Daniel tomorrow. He should remember. He remembers everything :)
[2013-10-15 20:32:27] sevaseva: it could be that it was installed by default in the distro we were using before, now it's not. Let me see.. (but may have to complete that tomorrow - almost need to go)
[2013-10-15 20:32:53] lukeis: no worries, didn't expect to see you again tonight
