[2013-10-28 03:29:58] SamuraiJack_: barancev: hi
[2013-10-28 03:30:13] SamuraiJack_: do you know what will be the best way to reach the FF WebDriver developers?
[2013-10-28 03:30:34] SamuraiJack_: do they hang out here?
[2013-10-28 03:34:32] AutomatedTester: SamuraiJack_: whats wrong?
[2013-10-28 03:34:55] SamuraiJack_: AutomatedTester: hi
[2013-10-28 03:35:01] SamuraiJack_: AutomatedTester: it's http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=6390
[2013-10-28 03:35:17] SamuraiJack_: finally managed to create a reprducible test case for it
[2013-10-28 03:36:03] barancev: we're here, but I suspect no one consider this bug as critical. at least I don't :)
[2013-10-28 03:36:04] SamuraiJack_: its pretty big issue for us, our product (testing tool) stopped working for big suites in FF
[2013-10-28 03:36:16] SamuraiJack_: heh
[2013-10-28 03:36:56] SamuraiJack_: its just it used to work, I'm pretty sure
[2013-10-28 03:37:11] SamuraiJack_: and it works in other drivers, even in IE driver
[2013-10-28 03:37:36] SamuraiJack_: since when FF is behind the IE? ;)
[2013-10-28 03:38:32] AutomatedTester: SamuraiJack_: so you just do driver.execute_script("__GLOBAL_VAR__ = JSONBLOB") and the browser crashes?
[2013-10-28 03:39:06] SamuraiJack_: AutomatedTester: seems it does not crash, but Webdriver throws the exception
[2013-10-28 03:39:28] SamuraiJack_: browser window itself remains opened
[2013-10-28 03:39:41] Dave_B_: if the browser crashes then it should throw the exception
[2013-10-28 03:39:54] Dave_B_: oh
[2013-10-28 03:39:57] Dave_B_: sorry reading fail
[2013-10-28 03:40:26] lsfc1914: Hello. I am using Selenium IDE. Is there a function that can loop through all options of dropdown list?

[2013-10-28 03:43:46] AutomatedTester: >>> f.execute_script("var __GLOBAL_VAR__ = 'JSONBLOB';")
[2013-10-28 03:43:51] AutomatedTester: no error when I do that
[2013-10-28 03:44:04] AutomatedTester: so its something about what is being sent
[2013-10-28 03:44:10] SamuraiJack_: AutomatedTester: what's the size of JSONBLOB?
[2013-10-28 03:44:27] AutomatedTester: 8 chars :)
[2013-10-28 03:44:35] AutomatedTester: JSONBLOB
[2013-10-28 03:44:41] SamuraiJack_: it works fine for small "blobs"
[2013-10-28 03:44:55] SamuraiJack_: and it fails on "blobs" > 1.5MB
[2013-10-28 03:45:40] barancev: that's why I tols it is not critical :)

[2013-10-28 03:55:29] SamuraiJack_: sounds like it can be something related to network
[2013-10-28 03:56:14] AutomatedTester: SamuraiJack_: is there anything in the browser console?

[2013-10-28 04:41:57] jimevans: and it could easily be timing related.

[2013-10-28 08:06:02] patarr: Or start with a certain prefix more specifically.
[2013-10-28 08:06:05] jimevans: patarr: nope.
[2013-10-28 08:06:14] patarr: Hm. Then how about all types of an element.
[2013-10-28 08:06:15] jimevans: you could use starts-with in xpath
[2013-10-28 08:06:18] patarr: Just like, all <canvas> tags
[2013-10-28 08:06:34] jimevans: By.tagName will give you all of a given tag.
[2013-10-28 08:06:42] patarr: perfect
[2013-10-28 08:06:58] Dude-X: patarr you can find all elements using a regex using javascript code
[2013-10-28 08:07:01] AutomatedTester: .//canvas[starts-with(@attribute, 'item')]
[2013-10-28 08:07:08] jimevans: you could also use the starts-with function in xpath, or possibly the ^= operator in css selectors.
[2013-10-28 08:07:34] Dude-X: but you can match prefix with css: div[id^='prefix']
[2013-10-28 08:07:51] Dude-X: maybe even *[id^='x']

[2013-10-28 09:36:33] Dude-X: therealfakemoot: https://gist.github.com/Dude-X/997ba13235c9d24121e1
[2013-10-28 09:37:00] therealfakemoot: elaborate
[2013-10-28 09:37:44] Dude-X: so this wrapper provides a wrapper to almost all the functions in the base driver object
[2013-10-28 09:38:13] therealfakemoot: Not a fan of the get_* methods
[2013-10-28 09:38:19] therealfakemoot: especialyl because they're properties already
[2013-10-28 09:38:31] therealfakemoot: can just be named "page_source" or current_url or whatever
[2013-10-28 09:38:32] Dude-X: i only use get_element()
[2013-10-28 09:38:33] therealfakemoot: nbd
[2013-10-28 09:39:08] Dude-X: in the page objects, i only use get_element() and my locator objects are tuples that have the By.type, locator string, and a descriptive string
[2013-10-28 09:39:18] therealfakemoot: Neat
[2013-10-28 09:40:00] Dude-X: this is something i learned from a project that used Java; so i feel some parts are a bit overkill in python, still when it comes to fixing an old test, more comments == better time spent debugging
[2013-10-28 09:40:18] therealfakemoot: No worries
[2013-10-28 09:40:24] therealfakemoot: This is nice code
[2013-10-28 09:40:31] therealfakemoot: and I'm totally stealing pieces. Or ideas.
[2013-10-28 09:40:51] therealfakemoot: I definitely need these wait* functions
[2013-10-28 09:41:10] Dude-X: yeah
[2013-10-28 09:41:50] Dude-X: so my browser object wraps webdriver but i also have a BasePage object that has convenience methods like random number generation, or date generation
[2013-10-28 09:42:21] therealfakemoot: huh
[2013-10-28 09:42:22] therealfakemoot: okay
[2013-10-28 09:42:25] therealfakemoot: what did you write this one for?
[2013-10-28 09:42:55] therealfakemoot: a vage general answer is okay
[2013-10-28 09:43:05] therealfakemoot: I know all about confidentiality and stuff
[2013-10-28 09:43:31] Dude-X: this wrapper? we needed a way to write maintainable and easy to write web driver tests
[2013-10-28 09:43:44] Dude-X: all tests only use page object methods and asserts
[2013-10-28 09:43:52] Dude-X: and you put all the web driver logic in page objects
[2013-10-28 09:43:54] therealfakemoot: Just curious how you would describe it
[2013-10-28 09:45:14] Dude-X: i copied this from the work of my prior coworkers; but i've seen made big improvements
[2013-10-28 09:45:22] Dude-X: like no more find_elements_by_type
[2013-10-28 09:45:54] Dude-X: when i change a locator, it was a huge maintenance burden to update all the find_by_type calls
[2013-10-28 09:46:47] Dude-X: in Java I had to create a locator class, but in Python it was simple to use a tuple.
[2013-10-28 09:47:24] therealfakemoot: right
[2013-10-28 09:47:45] Dude-X: to use adamgoucher's wording, i would call my test library my own biased framework of how to write web driver tests
[2013-10-28 09:48:00] therealfakemoot: Righto
[2013-10-28 09:48:01] Dude-X: the configuration part is a py.test conftest.py
[2013-10-28 09:48:17] therealfakemoot: I've got a yaml file
[2013-10-28 09:48:19] Dude-X: i don't have that part fully fleshed out
[2013-10-28 09:48:22] therealfakemoot: heh
[2013-10-28 09:48:24] therealfakemoot: man
[2013-10-28 09:48:26] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-28 09:48:30] therealfakemoot: I've got some real shit goin on
[2013-10-28 09:49:00] Dude-X: but i use pytest.ini and conftest.py to setup the driver; i can do things like read an environment variable to load firebug for firefox
[2013-10-28 09:49:01] therealfakemoot: Dude-X: I'm using something called testscenarios, and it's letting me spawn tests in firefox, chrome, and whatever other drivers I want all with one base testsuite
[2013-10-28 09:49:15] Dude-X: but for now i only test against firefox because it's the most stable API
[2013-10-28 09:49:37] Dude-X: chromedriver breaks often
[2013-10-28 09:50:42] Dude-X: in the future, i will improve the errors i have in my wrapper to use a custom Exception class rather than Exception
[2013-10-28 09:51:11] Dude-X: also i will incorporate a decorator to time the calls to find an element
[2013-10-28 09:51:35] therealfakemoot: interesting
[2013-10-28 09:51:55] Dude-X: i've noticed that if takes too long to find an element, you have to either try an alternate locator strategy, or implement a wait before interacting with the element
[2013-10-28 09:52:11] Dude-X: so keeping track of timings is a good way to make sure you won't have tests that flake in the future
[2013-10-28 09:52:20] therealfakemoot: fair enough
[2013-10-28 09:52:24] therealfakemoot: I haven't written many complex tests yet
[2013-10-28 09:52:31] therealfakemoot: Nothing involving AJAX or popups
[2013-10-28 09:53:51] Dude-X: another thing to is keep track of exceptions as well in the find element calls, and the kind of exceptions; if normally an element is located doesn't throw exceptions but intermittantly, then a good use case is to track the number of hidden exceptions to find out if there is some change to the UI. It might be a hint to use a wait call before the find.
[2013-10-28 09:54:46] Dude-X: i went to a Selenium meetup where a company hardly ever uses WebDriverWait, instead they try once or twice to relocate an element;
[2013-10-28 09:55:22] therealfakemoot: yeesh
[2013-10-28 09:55:23] Dude-X: the nice thing about that approach is that you have real fast tests.
[2013-10-28 09:55:38] Dude-X: the bad thing about that approach is you spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to wait.
[2013-10-28 09:56:01] therealfakemoot: hm
[2013-10-28 09:56:03] therealfakemoot: Yeah
[2013-10-28 09:56:04] Dude-X: they do have wait methods but they only use it for really slow AJAX. it's kind of bizarre actually
[2013-10-28 09:56:07] therealfakemoot: Time is a nissue
[2013-10-28 09:56:23] therealfakemoot: We've got a big site. We need to run these tests in three browsers on at least three OS's
[2013-10-28 09:56:28] barancev: therealfakemoot: why they faster than with use of WebDriverWait?
[2013-10-28 09:56:41] barancev: sorry
[2013-10-28 09:56:49] barancev: Dude-X: why they faster than with use of WebDriverWait?
[2013-10-28 09:56:57] Dude-X: because it will fail quickly
[2013-10-28 09:57:07] Dude-X: the default wait is 500 ms
[2013-10-28 09:57:22] barancev: one can set 100ms
[2013-10-28 09:57:42] Dude-X: i am aware of that; but i like the default
[2013-10-28 09:58:03] Dude-X: i've found some interesting characteristics when you tweak times
[2013-10-28 09:58:15] Dude-X: at least on the project i worked at previously
[2013-10-28 09:58:17] barancev: 100ms is too small timeout if you run remotely
[2013-10-28 09:58:45] Dude-X: i've only ran tests against a native driver;
[2013-10-28 09:58:53] Dude-X: but maybe i should take that into consideration
[2013-10-28 09:59:00] barancev: and time is *not* an issue because you can do parallel tests to achieve much better times than with wait optimizations :)
[2013-10-28 09:59:30] Dude-X: well how long something waits to get something done can be an indicator that the wait strategy is poor
[2013-10-28 09:59:45] therealfakemoot: yes
[2013-10-28 09:59:46] Dude-X: and if you see an element appear in .7 seconds and it takes 2 seconds to find and click
[2013-10-28 10:00:00] Dude-X: then odds are that you may have a flakey test on that command
[2013-10-28 10:00:01] therealfakemoot: figuring out how to run tests in extreme parallel is high on my priority list
[2013-10-28 10:00:04] therealfakemoot: don't know how to do that
[2013-10-28 10:00:20] Dude-X: on the high level, make sure the tests are independent of each other
[2013-10-28 10:00:46] Dude-X: this means test 1 doesn't need to rely on test 2 to populate data
[2013-10-28 10:00:59] barancev: at least youcan run tests for 3 browsers x 3 OSes in parallel
[2013-10-28 10:01:27] barancev: no wait optimization can give you 9x speedup :)
[2013-10-28 10:02:03] Dude-X: ideally you have one host per browser; otherwise if you don't, then figure out to group your tests so that they don't stomp over each other; and finally if you have tests that can stomp over each other, then implement a locking mechanism
[2013-10-28 10:02:40] Dude-X: one thing i want to experiment with is using docker to run multiple browser tests
[2013-10-28 10:03:09] therealfakemoot: docker?
[2013-10-28 10:03:20] Dude-X: http://docker.io
[2013-10-28 10:03:35] Dude-X: basically virtualization at the app level instead of the OS level
[2013-10-28 10:04:18] Dude-X: have a container that simply contains web driver, a browser, vnc; and you can spawn multiple containers of web driver on a single host
[2013-10-28 10:06:31] Dude-X: therealfakemoot: one thing to note in my wrapper is that the call to get_element calls another wrapped library; some people want that if you call find_element (no S) that it only locates only one element, and not more than one. This can be a common source of webdriver tests failures.
[2013-10-28 10:07:01] Dude-X: i don't do that because sometimes you want to find one element only; in 99% of the cases, a match against many should match the first element
[2013-10-28 10:08:36] therealfakemoot: hm
[2013-10-28 10:08:39] therealfakemoot: Yeah.
[2013-10-28 10:08:45] therealfakemoot: I don't have a good solution for that yet
[2013-10-28 10:09:49] Dude-X: in my java framework i wrote a find_first_element_of() function
[2013-10-28 10:09:52] noahsussman, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-28 10:10:04] Dude-X: but that's something i discourage people from using often, unless they have to
[2013-10-28 10:10:17] Dude-X: actually i wrote that function to fix old tests
[2013-10-28 10:10:58] Dude-X: newer tests had to assert that there is one and only one object or specify that it is the first in the list
[2013-10-28 10:11:12] therealfakemoot: hell
[2013-10-28 10:11:27] therealfakemoot: when I'm expecting one element, I just do find_elements_by_X()[0]
[2013-10-28 10:11:29] therealfakemoot: but uh
[2013-10-28 10:11:46] Dude-X: that is okay too
[2013-10-28 10:11:46] therealfakemoot: there are definitely SINGULAR forms of all those methods
[2013-10-28 10:12:05] therealfakemoot: find_element_by_xpath, find_elements_by_xpath
[2013-10-28 10:12:12] Dude-X: find_element_by_x will return one WebElement, if there are many it will return the first in the DOM
[2013-10-28 10:12:19] therealfakemoot: right right
[2013-10-28 10:12:24] therealfakemoot: that's fine
[2013-10-28 10:12:32] therealfakemoot: because if it isn't what I expected, the test (should) fail
[2013-10-28 10:12:34] Dude-X: some jquery widgets create copies of themselves
[2013-10-28 10:12:38] Dude-X: yeah
[2013-10-28 10:12:50] Dude-X: ooh another testing tip
[2013-10-28 10:12:53] gdennis, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-28 10:12:58] Dude-X: if you work with a team of people who write tests
[2013-10-28 10:13:10] Dude-X: take a test they write and change the asserts to the opposite value
[2013-10-28 10:13:14] Dude-X: make sure the tests fail that way
[2013-10-28 10:13:23] Dude-X: i've had coworkers write poor tests that will always pass.
[2013-10-28 10:14:08] Dude-X: but if you do work on a team, code reviews are important, but i find that sometimes what looks reasonable isn't

[2013-10-28 10:18:10] *lukeis has separate teams doing both PR way and Gerrit'
[2013-10-28 10:19:01] jimevans: talkKorp: what's not working? driver.findElement(By.name("foo")) should work pretty well.
[2013-10-28 10:19:18] talkKorp: Yeah tried that. Says it can't find the element
[2013-10-28 10:19:28] Dude-X: gerritt is okay, but you need scripts to make it easy for the developers to use it without them revolting
[2013-10-28 10:20:08] jimevans: talkKorp: two things come to mind. the element is in a frame/iframe, so you need driver.switchTo().frame() first, or that the element hasn't been added to the DOM at the time you're finding it, so you need to wait for it.
[2013-10-28 10:20:54] talkKorp: Gotcha. Let me try that!
[2013-10-28 10:24:40] talkKorp: Hey thanks a ton, jimevans. Worked like a charm!

[2013-10-28 10:34:57] Dude-X: yes that would be helpful as  a template
[2013-10-28 10:35:04] cgoldberg: it basically forks a process and instantiates a webdriver in the new process.. then streams output back to main process via subunit.

[2013-10-28 10:38:17] cgoldberg: therealfakemoot, if you are already using testools, this is perfect for you
[2013-10-28 10:39:01] cgoldberg: the framework we wrote has it built in as a command line option (--concurrency)
[2013-10-28 10:39:07] therealfakemoot: cgoldberg: Ever worked with Trial?
[2013-10-28 10:39:42] cgoldberg: therealfakemoot, actually yes recently was investigating twisted trial
[2013-10-28 10:39:54] cgoldberg: i know some devs that use it
[2013-10-28 10:39:55] therealfakemoot: cgoldberg: I've used those as a base class for my test cases
[2013-10-28 10:40:05] therealfakemoot: and they integrate flawlessly with testtools thus far

[2013-10-28 10:40:41] brian_hutton, quitting. ()
[2013-10-28 10:41:02] cgoldberg: therealfakemoot, so testtools originated from the bzr codebase.. but they didn't include the parallelization implementation
[2013-10-28 10:41:27] cgoldberg: i essentially took the bits from bzr you need to do concurrency (like the bzr suite does)
[2013-10-28 10:42:02] therealfakemoot: cgoldberg: I'll dive into the source at some point
[2013-10-28 10:42:13] cgoldberg: therealfakemoot, does Trial do parallel/concurrency?
[2013-10-28 10:42:24] therealfakemoot: cgoldberg: Trial lets you turn tests into deferreds

[2013-10-28 10:42:57] dimacus, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-28 10:43:00] therealfakemoot: cgoldberg: I don't understand deferreds very well (at all) but I'm fairly confident that means that truly independent tests (taht don't alter data) can be spun off and run in parallel
[2013-10-28 10:43:04] therealfakemoot: somehow?
[2013-10-28 10:43:08] therealfakemoot: I'm not actually that familiar with twisted
[2013-10-28 10:43:25] Dude-X: hmm for web driver tests, you won't get real concurrency
[2013-10-28 10:43:42] Dude-X: unless you patch the TCP calls to the driver to use twisted
[2013-10-28 10:44:26] Dude-X: and if you defer the driver to thread, i don't know effective is multithreading network calls with python is (it should be ok, despite the GIL)
[2013-10-28 10:44:38] cgoldberg: Dude-X, you get process isolation with a shared resource (calling the driver)... so it works even if not comepltely isolated
[2013-10-28 10:44:39] therealfakemoot: It's pretty complex
[2013-10-28 10:44:40] Dude-X: but i would bet you would get sucky performance at some point
[2013-10-28 10:45:19] cgoldberg: Dude-X, depends on test and hardware you are on.. but my machine I get an increase up to 8 parallel webdriver processes
[2013-10-28 10:45:28] cgoldberg: then flattens out
[2013-10-28 10:45:42] Dude-X: using threading for drivers?
[2013-10-28 10:45:50] cgoldberg: Dude-X, not threading

[2013-10-28 10:46:07] therealfakemoot: My biggest issue is..."how do I split a whole suite between n CPUs/VMs/whatever, and insure that each one gets a unique driver process
[2013-10-28 10:46:47] Dude-X: therealfakemoot: bash scripts can simplify your life, don't have to do everything in python
[2013-10-28 10:46:55] cgoldberg: therealfakemoot, for across CPU's, see my module.. it's right there for you : https://github.com/cgoldberg/concurrencytest
[2013-10-28 10:47:20] therealfakemoot: Dude-X: I'm open to solutions that work
[2013-10-28 10:47:29] cgoldberg: https://github.com/cgoldberg/concurrencytest/blob/master/concurrencytest.py#L47
[2013-10-28 10:47:51] Dude-X: so any test framework can accept a list of tests to run
[2013-10-28 10:47:59] Dude-X: that's something you can exploit
[2013-10-28 10:48:28] Dude-X: with a script that will collect all tests, and then distribute them based on some configuration
[2013-10-28 10:49:18] cgoldberg: see : https://github.com/cgoldberg/concurrencytest/blob/master/concurrencytest.py#L103 for partitioning tests in Python.

[2013-10-28 11:57:10] davidlai: I think if you can locate the iframe webelment.  You can use that in place of the frame name.
[2013-10-28 11:57:49] davidlai: Another tactic I use is to just get a list of all frame handles, and iterate through them until I can instantiate my expected PageObject against them.
[2013-10-28 11:58:43] davidlai: Of course that isn't a very good solution.  That's for dealing with more annoying shadow dom elements that uses iframes.

[2013-10-28 12:37:40] dimacus: what is the error it give you?
[2013-10-28 12:38:23] phasze: the intellij was about some security error, something to do with "invalid signature file digest for manifest main attributes", I figure that's a maven library thing
[2013-10-28 12:38:32] phasze: only happens when I go to run the .jar file
[2013-10-28 12:38:54] phasze: there is a lot of text while compiling with "mvn package" but looks like it's failing on a few tests

[2013-10-28 13:07:15] dimacus: so my ios driver knowledge is like -10
[2013-10-28 13:07:23] lukeis: #fail ;)
[2013-10-28 13:07:30] dimacus: but i'm working my way unto a project that will allow it

[2013-10-28 13:23:10] therealfakemoot: xpath expressions are like regular expressions. The bigger your input data and the more specific you try to get with a single expression, the more trouble you'll have. And it scales exponentially the deeper you go
[2013-10-28 13:23:29] dabos, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-28 13:23:48] therealfakemoot: If you have very small input, short easy to read xpaths can be used. Which means that a series of short clean xpath expressions can do the same work as one monstrosity
[2013-10-28 13:23:52] lukeis: Oscar_Rieken: yeah, i don't like those examples…. i steer clear of using xpath :)  (but xpath is certainly a valid locator in ios-driver)
[2013-10-28 13:24:17] jimevans: therealfakemoot: the same could be said about css selectors, i suppose, except css selectors are better understood by web developers, so you have more support for getting the right one constructed.
[2013-10-28 13:24:50] therealfakemoot: anyways, this is a debate on a matter of taste
[2013-10-28 13:25:05] therealfakemoot: unwinnable, and not worth fighting
