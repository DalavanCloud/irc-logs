[2013-10-14 03:18:39] barancev: AutomatedTester: afaik no. what does it break? it is totally client-side
[2013-10-14 03:19:07] barancev: just for simplicity, to not break action chain to make a pause
[2013-10-14 03:19:45] AutomatedTester: barancev: thats totally fine
[2013-10-14 03:19:57] AutomatedTester: barancev: I dont like pause() I prefer wait()
[2013-10-14 03:20:14] AutomatedTester: and thats what has been discussed in the past thats why I asked
[2013-10-14 03:20:45] barancev: a new wait action? I'm ready to add it too :)
[2013-10-14 03:21:04] AutomatedTester: barancev: thats what has been discussed for touch actions for w3c stuff
[2013-10-14 03:21:19] barancev: cool, I missed the minutes
[2013-10-14 03:21:59] barancev: so let's go! implementing it?
[2013-10-14 03:22:18] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-14 03:22:36] AutomatedTester: barancev: its implemented in marionete
[2013-10-14 03:22:48] AutomatedTester: barancev: http://nakubu.com/site_media/webdriver-spec.html#interactions is a very dated spec of it
[2013-10-14 03:22:58] AutomatedTester: I have a newer version I am editting locally
[2013-10-14 03:23:10] AutomatedTester: but search for wait for example
[2013-10-14 03:23:25] barancev: it is not in the bindings
[2013-10-14 03:24:20] barancev: in 14.2.4.2.1 Action Chains I see only void wait (number ms)
[2013-10-14 03:24:51] barancev: sh*t!
[2013-10-14 03:24:58] barancev: you mean the method name
[2013-10-14 03:25:07] barancev: I'll rename it immediately
[2013-10-14 03:25:37] barancev: I thought you're talking about something like waitUntil(somecondition) action
[2013-10-14 03:26:53] barancev: so, wait is BAD method name in Java
[2013-10-14 03:27:04] barancev: it overrides a standatd Object method
[2013-10-14 03:27:36] barancev: and I'm too fast primising to rename it :(

[2013-10-14 07:41:15] nekminnit: remote. taking over 30secs for a long page, just wondering why that would be, and if i can speed it up somehow

[2013-10-14 07:42:19] jimevans: it has to create the screenshot, render it, encode the binary data to base64, and transfer the resulting string across the wire to the language bindings.
[2013-10-14 07:42:36] jimevans: for a long enough page, that could be a *significant* amount of data being transferred.
[2013-10-14 07:43:33] nekminnit: so you're suggesting it's mostly the data transfer time?
[2013-10-14 07:43:53] jimevans: i'm not suggesting anything. i don't know.
[2013-10-14 07:44:33] jimevans: but you could try it locally, to eliminate the transfer of data as a potential bottleneck (or at least to prove/disprove that as the cause)

[2013-10-14 08:39:11] evanton: how can I delete a certain element from the DOM using selenium? is there a WebBrowser method for this or something?
[2013-10-14 08:39:26] jimevans: evanton: how would a user delete an element from the DOM?
[2013-10-14 08:39:40] swente: evanton: at least you can send/execute javascript..
[2013-10-14 08:39:43] jimevans: (meaning an end-user simply browsing the site in question)
[2013-10-14 08:40:31] evanton: jimevans: I am trying to remove some inline JS code that displays popups when I change state of form checkboxes. This causes main window to lose focus
[2013-10-14 08:41:30] evanton: jimevans: so I thought that if I hack the DOM and remove that piece, it won't happen
[2013-10-14 08:41:43] jimevans: evanton: sounds like a bug in the javascript code to me, but what do i know? i'm pretty stupid when it comes to this stuff.
[2013-10-14 08:42:00] evanton: it's third party adware glued inline so I don't think it will effect site functionality at all
[2013-10-14 08:42:02] jimevans: evanton: but why won't handling the "popup" with webdriver work?
[2013-10-14 08:42:09] Dude-X: execute_script("annoying_func=null;")
[2013-10-14 08:42:34] evanton: jimevans: I don't need that popup at all, it's just ads in a new window, totally irrelevant for me
[2013-10-14 08:42:37] jimevans: or better: us a proxy and blacklist content from the appropriate site.
[2013-10-14 08:43:17] jimevans: also, remind me to never, ever, ever go to whatever site you're automating.
[2013-10-14 08:43:52] jimevans: but executing javascript would likely be your best bet.
[2013-10-14 08:44:22] evanton: I don't know the JS function name, I have just found a DIV tag that has some <script> stuff inside and I was hoping there's a way to just delete that whole DIG tag from the DOM
[2013-10-14 08:44:38] evanton: s/DIG/DIV/
[2013-10-14 08:45:05] evanton: jimevans: is the approach I'm thinking about wrong or just not possible technically?
[2013-10-14 08:45:15] swente: evanton: somewhere, some event must be associated to something. so, removing the code-body after evaluation [=load/execution] won't help much i'm afraid, you had to remove/overwrite that event-assignment, too.
[2013-10-14 08:46:11] evanton: swente: I see. so you suggest that I should dive into that actual javascript and see what functions are there and plug them with null stubs like Dude-X suggested above?
[2013-10-14 08:46:13] jimevans: evanton: you can remove the DOM node using javascript, sure. but without knowing what event triggers the javascript functions, you'd be hard-pressed to prevent at least some error.
[2013-10-14 08:46:40] jimevans: if the javascript is loaded from a third-party content server, again, i'd use a proxy, and blacklist that domain.
[2013-10-14 08:46:41] operatiay, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-14 08:47:00] swente: evanton: if the event calls a named method [e.g. onchange="javascript:my_handler()"], it would work like dude-x described, yes
[2013-10-14 08:47:12] jimevans: but no, webdriver doesn't provide random dom manipulation methods. that's not what it's designed for.
[2013-10-14 08:47:35] StephenBuckley: jimevans: barancev: yeah, it's kind of a bummer about the atom table.  Also, Jim, I'm about 99% sure that Chrome is way, way worse about leaking.  There's a great tool for keeping track of the table called AtomTableMonitor
[2013-10-14 08:47:52] swente: evanton: in short: you should be able to solve that problem, using javascript, but the exact way can't be told without knowing that page/site/app.
[2013-10-14 08:48:04] evanton: swente: I understand, thanks
[2013-10-14 08:48:08] swente: np :)
[2013-10-14 08:48:39] evanton: I am happy with python selenium bindings and I'm trying to avoid dealing with javascript directly as much as i can
[2013-10-14 08:49:00] swente: sure, but as long as the api doesn't bring what you might need .. JS is a powerful fallback imho.
[2013-10-14 08:49:02] StephenBuckley: jimevans: if you need to investigate the atom table http://thundaxsoftware.blogspot.com/2012/02/monitoring-global-atom-table-part-iii.html
[2013-10-14 08:51:01] evanton: swente: yes, and words can't tell the joy of having to deal with obfuscated and minified javascript code :)

[2013-10-14 13:04:09] barancev|2: I'd like driver.navigate().to() return WebDriver too
[2013-10-14 13:04:16] jimevans: i wouldn't
[2013-10-14 13:04:57] barancev|2: why not?
[2013-10-14 13:05:15] jimevans: because i *hate* fluent apis with the heat of a thousand suns.

[2013-10-14 13:06:47] jimevans: what's wrong with it? if you really have to ask, i can't help you.
[2013-10-14 13:07:06] jimevans: the fact that nothing is wrong with it in a fluent api is *exactly* what's wrong with it.
[2013-10-14 13:07:23] barancev|2: why in twqo lines it is so better than in one line?
[2013-10-14 13:07:29] barancev|2: and how about uncernanity of finding frames?
[2013-10-14 13:07:56] barancev|2: should we allow chaining "implicit frame searches" (by ID or name)
[2013-10-14 13:07:57] jimevans: if i had my way, switchTo() methods wouldn't return self-references either.
[2013-10-14 13:07:58] jimpurbrick, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-10-14 13:08:08] barancev|2: good point
[2013-10-14 13:08:18] barancev|2: I'd like them to be uniform
[2013-10-14 13:08:32] barancev|2: either all returns the driver, or all does not
[2013-10-14 13:08:41] barancev|2: it would be more logical
[2013-10-14 13:08:44] jimevans: all the switchTo() methods do.
[2013-10-14 13:08:48] jimevans: others don'tl.
[2013-10-14 13:08:52] jimevans: don't
[2013-10-14 13:10:00] jimevans: fluent interfaces lead to sloppy programming, particularly leading to code that can be difficult to debug.
[2013-10-14 13:10:21] jimevans: especially in an api that can by asynchronous, like webdriver's
[2013-10-14 13:11:04] jimevans: if our api was guaranteed to be completely synchronous, 100% of the time, without fail, i could get behind it, but we all know that's an impossible standard to meet.
[2013-10-14 13:13:45] jleyba: jimevans: IMO page objects do more to harm debugging than a fluent api
[2013-10-14 13:14:06] jimevans: that's because most page objects aren't actually that.
[2013-10-14 13:14:31] jimevans: people, as a general rule, don't properly understand the page object pattern
[2013-10-14 13:15:07] jleyba: well i realize i'm a special case.  i just want to see the actual webdriver calls so i can see what's going on
[2013-10-14 13:15:09] jimevans: and, i'd submit  that the issue isn't with "page objects" per se, but rather the use of the pagefactory
[2013-10-14 13:15:53] jimevans: which is one of those things that sounds great on the surface, but causes all kinds of headaches when you implement it improperly.
