[2013-10-24 09:31:42] lukeis: current release I believe you need to do  set_preference('webdriver_enable_native_events', 'false')

[2013-10-24 09:39:37] lukeis: Dude-X: yep… in favor of using json converter

Am I naming the bottom frame correctly?
[2013-10-24 09:41:23] jleyba: is it possible to sync an entire directory to a specific revision?  i know i can sync my entire client, or a particular file

[2013-10-24 09:42:49] lukeis: (i never sync to specific revisions)
[2013-10-24 09:42:54] Dude-X: petarm: i suspect you have to switch to the parent of 'bottom' before you switch to 'bottom'; our frame switch code is kind of lame.

[2013-10-24 09:43:34] jleyba: it's only lame in that you can't walk up the frame stack
[2013-10-24 09:43:45] jleyba: but yes, you need to switch frames one at a time
[2013-10-24 09:44:34] *lukeis hates frames with a passion'
[2013-10-24 09:45:07] jleyba: any developer that doesn't hate frames hasn't worked with them enough
[2013-10-24 09:45:35] petarm: Dude-X: jleyba: so if I am in the "top" fraim of the "main"-frameset, I need to switch to the "main" frame and then switch to the "bottom" frame in the "main"-frameset?
[2013-10-24 09:45:45] lukeis: my first job was on a site that had 30 framesets in it…. THIRTY
[2013-10-24 09:46:04] petarm: lukeis: I am only dealing with 2 and I hate it!
[2013-10-24 09:46:10] Dude-X: 30 frames, jeez
[2013-10-24 09:46:24] lukeis: i was able to reduce it to 12… my biggest contribution for that product
[2013-10-24 09:46:33] jleyba: driver.switchTo().defaultContent().switchTo().frame("child-of-top").switchTo().frame("grandchild-of-top")
[2013-10-24 09:47:25] jleyba: switchTo().defaultContent() should be switchTo().topFrame() or something else less ambiguous
[2013-10-24 09:47:49] lukeis: just a name… easy to alias it
[2013-10-24 09:48:51] petarm: They named one frame topFrame
[2013-10-24 09:48:57] Dude-X: :p
[2013-10-24 09:48:59] petarm: and the other one bottom

[2013-10-24 09:50:38] petarm: OK... this is going to be a silly question I think but is there a different command for switching to "frameset"?
[2013-10-24 09:52:16] jleyba: no, a frame is a frame
[2013-10-24 09:52:33] Dude-X, quitting. (Quit: Dude-X)
[2013-10-24 09:53:28] petarm: Hmm... I must be doing something wrong then... The frame structure is as follows: main (frameset) -> topFrame (frame) and bottom (frame).
[2013-10-24 09:54:01] jleyba: <frameset id="main"><frame id="topFrame" /><frame id="bottom" /></frameset>
[2013-10-24 09:54:03] jleyba: ?
[2013-10-24 09:54:15] petarm: Yes.
[2013-10-24 09:54:24] petarm: Sorry, I should have does that instead!
[2013-10-24 09:54:49] jleyba: driver.switchTo().defaultContent()  // select window.top (the frameset)
[2013-10-24 09:55:07] jleyba: driver.switchTo().frame(1);  // select window.frames[1]
[2013-10-24 09:55:12] jleyba: or...
[2013-10-24 09:55:13] Todd: our cmd admin panel is riddled with framesets
[2013-10-24 09:55:15] Todd: it's quite miserable
[2013-10-24 09:55:34] Todd: I wrote some code that wraps selenium to make it more semantic though
[2013-10-24 09:55:38] jleyba: driver.switchTo().frame(driver.findElement(By.id("frame-or-iframe-element-id")))
[2013-10-24 09:58:00] petarm: those are not python binding right?
[2013-10-24 09:58:19] lukeis: driver.switch_to_default_content()
[2013-10-24 09:58:20] jimevans: petarm: no, that's java. python would be driver.switch_to_frame()

[2013-10-24 10:40:58] admc, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-24 10:41:01] jarib: according to the spec, that seems to be the case
[2013-10-24 10:41:49] barancev: why it is not needed in the "main" set of the actions?
[2013-10-24 10:42:28] petarm: Is WebDriverWait(driver, 10) valid code?
[2013-10-24 10:42:55] jarib: barancev: yeah, that seems inconsistent. personally i i don't think it should be added at all
[2013-10-24 10:43:09] jleyba: jarib: +1
[2013-10-24 10:43:38] barancev: lukeis: you're right, it is not python issue, I can reproduce it in Java with RWD
[2013-10-24 10:44:17] barancev: jarib: jleyba: what about a case of "slow loaded menu"?
[2013-10-24 10:45:10] jleyba: barancev: setting aside the merits of surfacing "sleep" in the official API, it doesn't need to be in the spec
[2013-10-24 10:45:33] jleyba: the client bindings could handle it
[2013-10-24 10:45:39] barancev: actions are to be reimplemented
[2013-10-24 10:46:05] barancev: the whole chain to be send to the browser as a single transaction
[2013-10-24 10:46:16] ddary, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-24 10:46:23] jleyba: yeah, that's technically not possible
[2013-10-24 10:47:01] Dude-X: petarm: yes you can create a wait object. but most of the time, you will call until to get a result
[2013-10-24 10:47:02] jleyba: you can batch multiple commands, but there will always be a possibility that things need to happen on the client
[2013-10-24 10:47:26] barancev: if we implement pause on the client side only we'll have to break the chain, yes
[2013-10-24 10:47:55] jleyba: bottom line, if we have a pause/wait/sleep whatever in the API, we lose all standing for telling users not to insert random sleeps in their tests as a way to achieve synchronization

[2013-10-24 10:50:08] jarib: i agree with jleyba. we shouldn't encourage sleeps, even under a different name
[2013-10-24 10:50:19] barancev: ok, my point is:
[2013-10-24 10:50:39] barancev: 1) if we remove this adtion from the spec we have to remove it from the code
[2013-10-24 10:51:14] barancev: 2) if we have thia action in 'gestures' part it is reasonable to have it in the main part too
[2013-10-24 10:52:00] jarib: i'd be more positive to a waitUntil(expectedCondtion, timeout) or similar, although AFAICT that's the first API change to break the possibility of serializing the full chain
[2013-10-24 10:52:30] barancev: passing expected conditions to the browser? hmmm...
[2013-10-24 10:52:40] jarib: not going to work :)
[2013-10-24 10:52:54] jleyba: passing expected conditions is a non-starter
[2013-10-24 10:53:45] jarib: barancev: of those two i'd vote for 1
[2013-10-24 10:53:53] jimpurbrick, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-10-24 10:54:04] jleyba: the client API should support user defined actions - which sleep would fall into
[2013-10-24 10:54:46] jleyba: the Actions class would be responsible for batching commands as much as possible
[2013-10-24 10:54:58] barancev: it supports, in Java at least
[2013-10-24 10:55:36] jarib: jleyba: you mean having something like click_and_hold().then(function() { ... }).release().perform() ?
[2013-10-24 10:56:04] jleyba: jarib: pretty much
[2013-10-24 10:56:26] jarib: right
[2013-10-24 10:56:56] jleyba: actually, I say we throw all of the interactions API out the damn window and pretend it never existed
[2013-10-24 10:57:04] jarib: :D
[2013-10-24 10:57:19] cgoldberg: gah... who was asking about updating PhantomJS package for Ubuntu few weeks back?  i see it has been updated in the repos :)
[2013-10-24 10:57:21] *jleyba is on week 2 of tracking down regressions in the FirefoxDriver b/c the interactions API has 0% meaningful test coverage'
[2013-10-24 10:58:40] jarib: sounds like a great incentive for improving the tests
[2013-10-24 10:59:42] cgoldberg: detronizator_, I see updated PhantomJS in Ubuntu repos.  weren't you asking about that a few weeks back?

[2013-10-24 11:00:16] petarm: ok... very silly python question... The finally block get's executed after the try block has finished correct?
[2013-10-24 11:00:36] jarib: jleyba: so do you have a better design for solving advanced interactions?
[2013-10-24 11:01:02] petarm: so if I WebDriverWait for 30 seconds and the element is not found and I have a screenshot capture in the finally block, the screenshot will be taken after the wait?
[2013-10-24 11:01:32] lukeis: petarm: should be, yes… :gist your code?

[2013-10-24 11:04:25] petarm: lukeis: Oh no, the WebDriverWait(driver, 30) was another question. Thanks.

[2013-10-24 11:05:17] petarm: lukeis: Yes. Thank you. I thought selbot2 was going to do it for me :)... Sorry about that
[2013-10-24 11:05:41] jleyba: barancev: so instead of a wait() action, we should revisit the notion of a page publishing "ready" signals for WebDriver
[2013-10-24 11:05:42] lukeis: no worries, selbot is only as smart as we make it ;)
[2013-10-24 11:06:14] lukeis: petarm: that should work… but will take a screenshot no matter what after waiting for that condition.
[2013-10-24 11:06:32] lukeis: you could get a timeout exception thrown
[2013-10-24 11:06:48] cgoldberg: petarm, i make my screenshots configurable so you only get them on exceptions.  no need to screenshot every passed test
[2013-10-24 11:07:26] petarm: lukeis: Right. That is what I was expecting. My test throws a timeout exception here so I thought I would screenshot.
[2013-10-24 11:07:40] Dude-X: petard, it's better to have a test framework take screenshots on exception, not per action taken; but that can be a bit of a challenge to set up
[2013-10-24 11:08:39] petarm: But even after a 180 second wait it still shows me the loading screen. This is with the PhantomJS driver ... Firefox still throws the exception, but loads the page just fine.
[2013-10-24 11:09:23] petarm: Dude-X: That is something I plan on working in the future. I am just starting out with programming / python / slenium, so I am just trying to learn the actions / commands for now.
[2013-10-24 11:09:42] Dude-X: alright
[2013-10-24 11:10:41] petarm: Dude-X: Your autocorrect keeps wanting to call me names "petard" is very close to a mean, mean word :)

[2013-10-24 11:12:10] petarm: Dude-X: I find it hilarious

[2013-10-24 11:13:41] jleyba: at some point, the page decides it's in a steady state, sets __webdriverReady__ = true

[2013-10-24 12:18:32] lukeis: barancev: jenkins doesn't 'run twice' tests… means two different stack traces popped up for them typically
[2013-10-24 12:19:23] barancev: ah, I have an idea. one run is with JS enabled, another one with JS disabled
[2013-10-24 12:19:38] barancev: locally they are in two separate reports

[2013-10-24 12:20:07] phasze: so what would you guys recommend for iPad app testing?  If I remember from seConf there were two main competitors, "nativedriver" and "appium".  Anyone have experience with either or both?
[2013-10-24 12:20:42] lukeis: phasze: ios-driver or appium
[2013-10-24 12:21:11] phasze: lukeis: have you used them both, do you prefer one over the other, if so why?
[2013-10-24 12:21:12] *lukeis has experience with ios-driver'
[2013-10-24 12:21:25] *lukeis will remain mute on the comparison topic'
[2013-10-24 12:21:47] phasze: but I'm curious which one does things maybe better/faster than the other :(
[2013-10-24 12:22:02] phasze: or if they're both pretty much good?
[2013-10-24 12:22:07] lukeis: they both use Apple's intrumentation
[2013-10-24 12:22:31] lukeis: ios-driver was 'first' ;)
[2013-10-24 12:22:44] phasze: first isn't a feature :P
[2013-10-24 12:22:55] lukeis: :-D
[2013-10-24 12:24:03] petarm: likeis: No. This is an agent portal for an auto insurance company. I am only trying to automate it. I would want to shoot myself if I ever have to maintain a horrible code base like that.

[2013-10-24 12:27:40] phasze: so I take it you've used both and decided to go with ios-driver?

[2013-10-24 12:31:15] petarm: something like print(driver.current_frame()) ?
[2013-10-24 12:31:32] lukeis: oh, no, keep track of what you've switched to

[2013-10-24 12:33:54] lukeis: phasze: you can only run one instance of a simulator at a time… but you can connect many devices to a machine
[2013-10-24 12:35:19] petarm: lukeis: I am switching to driver.switch_to_default_content(). Is there a way to see what frame the driver chose as the "dafault" is that always the first occurrence of frame in the DOM?
[2013-10-24 12:35:26] phasze: lukeis: ah, that would probably be best.  I take it these also be connected to windows machines since it's all java then?
[2013-10-24 12:35:39] AutomatedTester: petarm: default == window.top
[2013-10-24 12:35:57] MaxSan: this is painful
[2013-10-24 12:36:14] lukeis: phasze: not currently, no, need mac still (but it's in the works to allow windows / linux I believe)
[2013-10-24 12:36:26] lukeis: petarm: yes… window.top
[2013-10-24 12:36:38] phasze: ooo, a linux would be lovely
[2013-10-24 12:36:38] lukeis: petarm: but that's not any 'frame'
[2013-10-24 12:37:38] MaxSan: if xpath finds my element that contains something
[2013-10-24 12:37:44] MaxSan: and all it brings back is some text
[2013-10-24 12:37:55] MaxSan: can i make it grab the next element after it like you would in jquery?
[2013-10-24 12:38:14] AutomatedTester: MaxSan: huh?
[2013-10-24 12:38:45] petarm: AutomateTester: lukeis: Please forgive my ignorance, but I am not sure I understand what window.top means ...
[2013-10-24 12:38:49] lukeis: MaxSan: sibling element?
[2013-10-24 12:38:57] lukeis: or next located element?
[2013-10-24 12:39:44] MaxSan: next located element
[2013-10-24 12:39:53] lukeis: petarm: if you open a javascript console in your browser and type window.top <- gives you the parent DOM window (which switch to default content sets you to)
[2013-10-24 12:40:10] lukeis: MaxSan: use findElements <-  s
[2013-10-24 12:40:19] AutomatedTester: petarm: each page is in a "frame". If that page has a frameset then you can go further through the pages. If you want to go back to the page you started on, with the frameset in it, window.top will get you there
[2013-10-24 12:40:46] MaxSan: el->element("xpath", "//h3[contains(., 'Draw No Bet')]")
[2013-10-24 12:41:03] lukeis: is that php?
[2013-10-24 12:41:51] chrismcmalunch, changing nick to chrismcmahon.
[2013-10-24 12:42:27] lukeis: there's findElement  & findElements  one returns a single element, the other returns a list. There should be an equivalent in all language bindings
[2013-10-24 12:43:06] petarm: AutomatedTester: Oh, I think I understand... Thank you. I just somehow stumbled upon a section on the developer console of chrome that gave me the frame structure! ... I was missing one frame level...

[2013-10-24 12:46:18] MaxSan: I think so

[2013-10-24 12:47:13] AutomatedTester: MaxSan: can you change the page at all?
[2013-10-24 12:47:24] lukeis: MaxSan: if you are doing it based on an "el" (element) context your xpath should be ".//h3….."
[2013-10-24 12:47:24] MaxSan: nope
[2013-10-24 12:47:35] lukeis: dot in front of the slashes
[2013-10-24 12:47:47] MaxSan: is there any tool like RegExr

[2013-10-24 14:50:57] barancev: I know a person who wanted to download a book from the torrent. that was disabled by company policy. he spent about 2 hrs to build a scheme: created a host on amazon, installed a torrent client, downloaded the book, put it to the dropbox and got it at last to its local machine
[2013-10-24 14:51:30] AutomatedTester: barancev: sounds like it would have been cheaper to buy
[2013-10-24 14:51:40] p_l: AutomatedTester: not necessarily
[2013-10-24 14:51:45] barancev: he wanted it urgent :)
[2013-10-24 14:51:52] barancev: only 2 hrs :)

[2013-10-24 14:55:31] lukeis: AutomatedTester: but i'm not hourly… i'm salary ;)
[2013-10-24 14:56:05] AutomatedTester: lukeis: you expense it anyway :P
[2013-10-24 14:56:30] lukeis: corporate amex? :)
[2013-10-24 14:56:32] barancev: and I'm self-employed now and have no salary nor hourly rate at all :)
[2013-10-24 14:56:43] lukeis: heh
[2013-10-24 14:56:48] barancev: and no dumb policies, only smart ones
[2013-10-24 14:57:11] AutomatedTester: barancev: that doesnt sound like self-employed it sounds more like unemployed
[2013-10-24 14:57:28] lukeis: barancev: as long as monies out < monies in :-D

[2013-10-24 15:00:54] barancev: actually my revenue now is much bigger than my salary was when I was employed :)
[2013-10-24 15:01:15] lukeis: but expenses? :)
[2013-10-24 15:01:36] barancev: so if you want to donate me you'd do it because I'm a good man, not because I'm a poor man :)
[2013-10-24 15:01:39] AutomatedTester: lukeis: you forget that barancev is THE father of testing in Russia
[2013-10-24 15:01:59] lukeis: indeed

[2013-10-24 15:09:23] Oscar1: sure I was thinking of doing something like i did for CukeUp NYC seems like not many people use cucumber/watir/selenium the way we do here
[2013-10-24 15:10:02] Oscar1: and our grid is pretty massive
[2013-10-24 15:11:59] barancev: btw, ppl, what size your grid is? question to all, a social survey
[2013-10-24 15:12:11] barancev: number of nodes

[2013-10-24 15:13:39] *stephend has already let barancev know :-)'
[2013-10-24 15:14:48] Oscar1: 200
[2013-10-24 15:14:59] Oscar1: 200 and can if needed spin up to 400
[2013-10-24 15:15:19] barancev: local? or in a cloud?
[2013-10-24 15:15:32] Oscar1: yes
[2013-10-24 15:15:52] lukeis: barancev: we don't use 'Selenium Grid' here at salesforce… have our own custom "autobuild" system
[2013-10-24 15:15:58] stephend: Oscar1: dynamic restarts, too?
[2013-10-24 15:16:28] Oscar1: no
[2013-10-24 15:16:40] Oscar1: we dont run into issues where nodes get locked up
[2013-10-24 15:16:52] Oscar1: or cant reconnect
[2013-10-24 15:17:26] Oscar1: linux nodes have 10 chrome 10 firefox windows ones have 5 ie 10chrome 10 firefox

[2013-10-24 15:19:03] Oscar1: yeah
[2013-10-24 15:19:09] phasze: do you test session stuff and popups?
[2013-10-24 15:19:42] phasze: like, will two IE instances be able to run and keep a proper session if one has a popup?
[2013-10-24 15:19:43] Oscar1: popups yes, things in the user session not so much
[2013-10-24 15:19:51] phasze: ah ok
[2013-10-24 15:20:05] Oscar1: so each scenario creates its own data
[2013-10-24 15:20:06] phasze: was just wondering if you got around that some how :P
[2013-10-24 15:20:10] Oscar1: so never the same user

[2013-10-24 15:23:03] Oscar1: im not following you, each scenario logs into the site as a different user, if there is a popup it would be specific to the user that logged in
[2013-10-24 15:23:25] phasze: Oscar1: so your popups do work properly....
[2013-10-24 15:23:41] Oscar1: lol im guessing
[2013-10-24 15:23:51] phasze: If I have an IE window open and some other session/user opens IE it loses the session on the popup
[2013-10-24 15:24:04] Oscar1: we never really had any issues with ie except for having to support ie8
[2013-10-24 15:24:50] phasze: and which IEDriver are you using?
[2013-10-24 15:25:44] Oscar1: i think we are still on 2.35
[2013-10-24 15:25:48] Oscar1: one sec
[2013-10-24 15:25:49] phasze: IE is my bottlekneck because of this session issue, but if yours works.....I'll need to investigate this
[2013-10-24 15:27:26] Oscar1: yeah 2.35
[2013-10-24 15:28:19] phasze: and you can have two IE instances active with two different users and the popups keep the session properly?
[2013-10-24 15:28:34] phasze: on the same VM at the same time

[2013-10-24 15:30:38] Oscar1: by popups you mean like dialogs and all that right
[2013-10-24 15:30:52] phasze: like a new window/tab
[2013-10-24 15:31:09] phasze: not a lightbox/fancybox
[2013-10-24 15:31:31] Oscar1: oh
[2013-10-24 15:31:44] Oscar1: hmm i dont think we have many of those if any

[2013-10-24 15:32:03] Oscar1: lol srry man
[2013-10-24 15:32:17] phasze: I have to cap each server at 1 IE instances because of that bloody thing lol
[2013-10-24 15:32:23] phasze: node*
[2013-10-24 15:32:32] Oscar1: :D just setup more nodes

[2013-10-24 15:34:28] phasze: Hehe, since I established the automated testing here just this year we haven't been allocated many servers.  Should be receiving more sometime though as the testers write more tests and the time takes longer for the full suite to run.
[2013-10-24 15:34:58] Oscar1: we have about 2700 scenarios that run in about 7-12 min
[2013-10-24 15:35:12] Oscar1: more hardware less expensive tools :D
[2013-10-24 15:35:15] phasze: scenarios include like 6+ browsers?
[2013-10-24 15:35:27] phasze: 2700x6?
[2013-10-24 15:35:34] Oscar1: nah, we have a job for each browser
[2013-10-24 15:35:47] Oscar1: 2700 scenarios total
[2013-10-24 15:36:06] phasze: hehe, we have 3000 of those that get run over like 6 hours :P

[2013-10-24 15:42:13] phasze: Oscar1: how much would you say each build costs you in automation servers?  I don't know if you have like amazon ec2 servers or something spin up each time.
[2013-10-24 15:43:02] Oscar1: we just started doing that so i dont really know all of our new projects will be using that right now everything we have are vms in house
[2013-10-24 15:43:35] barancev: looks like we have a latent issue that is hidden by the API, #6472
[2013-10-24 15:43:35] Oscar1: we are kinda lucky here we dont have many budget constraintes

[2013-10-24 15:45:20] lukeis: who implemented that crap anyways barancev :-P
[2013-10-24 15:45:52] barancev: lukeis: the protocol specification?
[2013-10-24 15:46:04] lukeis: no, the code in the firefox driver ;)
[2013-10-24 15:46:08] lukeis: and I was kidding
[2013-10-24 15:46:46] barancev: out client implementation *always* send current windows handle only
[2013-10-24 15:47:00] lukeis: yep
[2013-10-24 15:47:05] barancev: driver.manage().window().getSize() -- no window handle parameter here
[2013-10-24 15:47:21] lukeis: so you think it's a spec issue?
[2013-10-24 15:47:35] *AutomatedTester pretends to not be here'
[2013-10-24 15:47:43] lukeis: and maybe :windowHandle shouldn't be apart of the endpoint?
[2013-10-24 15:47:56] barancev: API does not use the ability claimed by the protocol
[2013-10-24 15:48:10] lukeis: doesn't matter that java doesn't implement it
[2013-10-24 15:48:14] barancev: either API is poor, or protocol can be simplified
[2013-10-24 15:48:17] lukeis: is the spec correct? :)
[2013-10-24 15:48:44] barancev: is it implemented in other bindings?
[2013-10-24 15:48:59] lukeis: yes, but they only use 'current' for the window handle
[2013-10-24 15:49:22] lukeis: essentially there's no point in passing :windowHandle since no one implements that… and thus the spec is worng
[2013-10-24 15:49:23] smccarthy: barancev: my selenium grid is just 3 nodes right now.
[2013-10-24 15:49:24] lukeis: wrong*
[2013-10-24 15:49:52] barancev: but we can expand API to do thing like driver.manage().window(someHandle).getSize()
[2013-10-24 15:50:32] barancev: and fix this issue in browsers, of course :)
[2013-10-24 15:59:50] lukeis: yes :)

[2013-10-24 16:57:19] AutomatedTester: thats the one we faill under
[2013-10-24 16:57:54] lukeis: i like the high number of observer requests ;)

[2013-10-24 17:26:18] Oscar3: as you should imo
[2013-10-24 17:26:26] Oscar3: isnt that why you have kids
[2013-10-24 17:26:48] Oscar3: to spam other people with pictures of them and the funny things they do/say
[2013-10-24 17:27:02] AutomatedTester: photos of my kids never go on Facebook
[2013-10-24 17:28:37] lukeis: we aren't privacy nuts :)  and i set us both to share only with 'friends'  unless FB decides to stop allowing us to set that privacy mode
[2013-10-24 17:29:35] AutomatedTester: im not a privacy nut, just don't trust 3rd parties to change their plans on a whim
[2013-10-24 17:30:21] AutomatedTester: plus the amount of Facebookers who would never put photos of their kids on facebook is scary
[2013-10-24 17:30:42] AutomatedTester: plus Mark Zuckerburg is buying all the houses around his to have more privacy
[2013-10-24 17:30:53] lukeis: heh :)
[2013-10-24 17:31:00] lukeis: we live in a weird world
[2013-10-24 17:31:37] lukeis: FB is actually the easiest means for me to share pics of my kids with extended family (and even immediate family) that we don't (care to) see often :)
[2013-10-24 17:32:22] AutomatedTester: I have a share on a VPS that I do that ;)
[2013-10-24 17:32:25] lukeis: maybe I should ask SHS why he / they don't post on it
