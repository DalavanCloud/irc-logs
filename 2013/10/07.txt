[2013-10-07 07:11:54] CaptainHeavy: OK, to get it without javascript I'd usually select it using this.driver.findElement(By.xpath("some xpath which states that I want to grab the element from the 'number' column in the first row of the 'compnay detail' form")).getText();
[2013-10-07 07:12:21] CaptainHeavy: and instead of returning the value "1472752" I get "null"
[2013-10-07 07:12:31] jimevans: and it's an <input> element?
[2013-10-07 07:12:44] CaptainHeavy: it is indeed
[2013-10-07 07:12:59] Dave_B_: what does .GetAttribute("value") give?
[2013-10-07 07:13:13] jimevans: getText() will never return the value of an <input> element. you need to use getAttribute("value")
[2013-10-07 07:13:18] CaptainHeavy: the raw HTML for the element is: <input id="_ChildRecords[Default_Model_Phone][1][PhoneNumber]" name="PhoneNumber-1" class="phone-type valid" type="text">
[2013-10-07 07:13:34] CaptainHeavy: it doesn't have a "value" attribute, unfortunately

[2013-10-07 07:23:28] jimevans: oh, and when you set the value programmatically in javascript, the HTML node "grows" a value attribute, even though it's not specifically specified in the markup.

[2013-10-07 07:31:13] StephenBuckley: jimevans: first of all, I hear you on the coffee
[2013-10-07 07:31:30] StephenBuckley: secondly, I think the IE webdriver is filling up my AppData\Temp folder
[2013-10-07 07:31:38] CaptainHeavy, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-10-07 07:32:13] StephenBuckley: is that a known bug/condition of the IEDriver?
[2013-10-07 07:34:05] jimevans: StephenBuckley: shouldn't be. as long as driver.quit() is being properly called, the IE driver should clean up after itself pretty well.
[2013-10-07 07:34:16] StephenBuckley: hmmm!
[2013-10-07 07:34:25] jimevans: note, that's driver.quit(), not driver.close().
[2013-10-07 07:34:43] StephenBuckley: I was going to say- I think we're doing .close()... double-checking now!
[2013-10-07 07:35:16] StephenBuckley: hmm
[2013-10-07 07:35:19] jimevans: close() will close the session, but it explicitly won't close out the IEDriverServer.exe correctly.
[2013-10-07 07:35:34] StephenBuckley: I'm using the php framework and using session->close()
[2013-10-07 07:36:02] jimevans: s/the php framework/a php framework/
[2013-10-07 07:36:06] jimevans: there. i fixed it for you.

[2013-10-07 07:36:49] jimevans: the proliferation of php language bindings is one of the huge frustrations for me as a developer on the webdriver project.
[2013-10-07 07:37:28] jimevans: at one time, there were at least a half dozen, all in varying degree of elegance/maintenance/upkeep/usability.
[2013-10-07 07:37:56] jimevans: the so-called "facebook" ones were among the worst.

[2013-10-07 07:39:59] jimevans: i gather they may have gotten better since they were rewritten. doesn't change the fact that they're still "public source", not "open source" as far as i know.
[2013-10-07 07:41:03] StephenBuckley: I'm in the prewritten codebase

[2013-10-07 08:52:23] p_l: haha
[2013-10-07 08:52:53] jimevans: the incumbent is a second-generation republican, representing one of the most conservative and affluent districts in the tampa bay area.
[2013-10-07 08:53:12] brma: that's pretty awesome.  I like your 'radical moderate' tag line.  I wish I could vote for you

[2013-10-07 08:53:24] jimevans: move to the florida 12th! :)

[2013-10-07 08:54:10] brma: you should campaign at local tech meetups!  If you get the geek vote you'd probably have the best social networking of any of the candidates.

[2013-10-07 09:44:32] Dude-X: qaguy: only thing that catches my eye is that you're returning a list of nodes
[2013-10-07 09:44:47] jimevans: qaguy: i'm not sure that'll work. what are you trying to do more specifically? you're returning a list of nodes from execute_script. what do you want to do with it?
[2013-10-07 09:45:13] Dude-X: i don't think execute script can handle returning a list
[2013-10-07 09:45:15] qaguy: jimevans: each node should be an element in the dom.
[2013-10-07 09:45:23] qaguy: I want to click on each one
[2013-10-07 09:45:53] qaguy: so I would like to do interests[1] and click on that
[2013-10-07 09:46:00] jimevans: then just loop through interests, and call click on each one.

[2013-10-07 09:48:54] jimevans: of course, if those items cause a change in the DOM, other elements in your list may become stale.

[2013-10-07 10:35:34] Prometheian: I have a table filled with data. Row 1 has the name of the item I want to find, row 4 has a checkbox. I want to be able to check that checkbox.
[2013-10-07 10:37:02] StephenBuckley: do you have a way for getting the fourth row for any first row? like, class name for each row?
[2013-10-07 10:37:44] jimevans: Prometheian: no worries. find row 1, navigate up the DOM to the parent and down to row 4 (using xpath).
[2013-10-07 10:38:05] Prometheian: class="TableStdRow", but other rows have that
[2013-10-07 10:38:09] Prometheian: jimevans, how?

[2013-10-07 10:39:34] jimevans: remember the ".." path in xpath will navigate up the tree.

[2013-10-07 10:44:56] jimevans: what about class=TableStdRow?
[2013-10-07 10:45:06] jimevans: you mentioned that before.
[2013-10-07 10:45:22] Prometheian: Multiple table rows in the table have that.
[2013-10-07 10:46:04] Prometheian: jimevans, if my webelement's xpath ends with tr[2]/td[1]/a and I want tr[2]/td[4]/input do I just have to put  xpath("//../../td[4]/input")
[2013-10-07 10:46:11] jimevans: okay, but if you did a findElements(By.className("TableStdRow")), you'd at least have something less fragile than the full path from the root <html> element.
[2013-10-07 10:46:34] Prometheian: The site parts I'm working on are unlikely to change enough to make it an issue.

[2013-10-07 10:49:01] Prometheian: Go for testing!
[2013-10-07 10:49:14] jimevans: the xpath "./../../td[4]/input" means, "start with the current node, navigate to its parent, navigate to that one's parent, look for the 4th td node as a direct child, and find the direct child of the td node that is an input"

[2013-10-07 12:44:24] StephenBuckley: right
[2013-10-07 12:44:26] StephenBuckley: ok

[2013-10-07 12:45:10] StephenBuckley: jimevans: so in order to have regular temp cleanups I'd have to disconnect the IEDriverServer node from the hub and reconnect it

[2013-10-07 12:46:08] jleyba: I hate it so damn much
[2013-10-07 12:46:19] jimevans: StephenBuckley: the IEDriverServer typically doesn't run all the time. it's started as-needed by the node.

[2013-10-07 12:49:11] nirvdrum: jleyba: Do you know anyone on the PPAPI team I could put the Firebreath author in touch with?  With NPAPI being phased how, he's interested in adding PPAPI support to the framework, but has a few questions first.
[2013-10-07 12:49:40] StephenBuckley: jimevans: ok! now I'm seeing the issue.
[2013-10-07 12:49:48] jleyba: XML based configuration....why do java developers hate themselves so much?
[2013-10-07 12:49:59] StephenBuckley: jimevans: lots of hung IEDriverServers which weren't killed when I killed the node

[2013-10-07 12:50:10] jleyba: nirvdrum: no, I do not.  I saw dawagner posted on internal g+ about it. don't think anyone bit
[2013-10-07 12:50:28] nirvdrum: Ahh.  I emailed him last week, but he seemed to have ignored me :-P
[2013-10-07 12:50:36] nirvdrum: Maybe I should give him more credit.
[2013-10-07 12:51:15] jimevans: StephenBuckley: this is exactly the reason why the .NET bindings start up IEDriverServer.exe processes in different command prompt windows. makes it much, much easier to see when the process hasn't exited.

[2013-10-07 12:51:23] dimacus: jleyba: i was wondering about xml myself for a while… but isn't property file 1 worst than xml based config?
[2013-10-07 12:52:40] jleyba: dimacus: My main gripe are apps/frameworks that configure themselves through XML (jetty)
[2013-10-07 12:52:52] jleyba: Actually, that's just my gripe at the moment. XML is pretty terrible across the board
[2013-10-07 12:52:54] StephenBuckley: jimevans: yeah, holy moly. there were hundreds
[2013-10-07 12:53:33] jimevans: StephenBuckley: driver.quit(). learn it. love it. use it.
[2013-10-07 12:53:33] dimacus: jleyba:  completely agree on XML part
[2013-10-07 12:54:12] StephenBuckley: I do use it, but if a jenkins job times out then it basically orphans the browser
[2013-10-07 12:54:13] nirvdrum: jimevans: That sounds like a good idea for a tattoo.
[2013-10-07 12:54:13] dimacus: it's even more perplexing when an XML fan boy tries to defend it with whole heart
[2013-10-07 12:54:27] nirvdrum: StephenBuckley: Set a timeout?
[2013-10-07 12:54:40] jimevans: nirvdrum: i'll see if i can work it into my platform.
[2013-10-07 12:54:43] nirvdrum: dimacus: I'm not a fan boy, but I do prefer XML to JSON for config.
[2013-10-07 12:54:59] jimevans: s/platform/stump speech/
[2013-10-07 12:55:01] StephenBuckley: nirvdrum: you mean like a node/hub timeout?
[2013-10-07 12:55:42] nirvdrum: StephenBuckley: By default, a 30 min. timeout is applied.  If the client doesn't interact with a browser for that long, the browser session will be killed.  You can tune that way down.
[2013-10-07 12:55:42] dimacus: jleyba: i guess my hate of XML came from the fact that jenkins stores EVERYTHING  as an XML flat file on the HD
[2013-10-07 12:55:51] nirvdrum: If you apply it at the hub level, it'll pass on to the node.
[2013-10-07 12:55:51] dimacus: nicegraham:  YAML all the way :-P
[2013-10-07 12:56:10] StephenBuckley: nirvdrum: right, but then the php thread hangs forever
[2013-10-07 12:56:18] lord12341: jleyba: pm
[2013-10-07 12:56:20] nirvdrum: StephenBuckley: Huh?
[2013-10-07 12:56:21] lord12341: yaml is the way
[2013-10-07 12:56:40] nirvdrum: I like yaml.  The parsers for it are pretty shitty across the board though.
[2013-10-07 12:57:22] StephenBuckley: nirvdrum: I'm using the facebook php-webdriver, and the hub doesn't give any indication if a node times out, just kills the browser
[2013-10-07 12:57:41] StephenBuckley: then the jenkins job runs forever
[2013-10-07 12:57:45] nirvdrum: StephenBuckley: Well, this timeout in particular would be a client inactivity one...
[2013-10-07 12:57:50] StephenBuckley: right
[2013-10-07 12:58:04] nirvdrum: At that point, ostensibly you've already lost that client thread.
[2013-10-07 12:58:08] StephenBuckley: man, I should make a diagram and put it on imgur
[2013-10-07 12:58:19] nirvdrum: So, no need to also tie up the browser.
[2013-10-07 12:58:56] StephenBuckley: the takeaway here is, I think I understand why the IEDriver wasn't getting quit.
[2013-10-07 12:58:56] dimacus: nirvdrum: .NET yes terrible… Java so so… Ruby has a really decent yaml parser. YAML -> Hash and back.. just delicous
[2013-10-07 12:59:26] nirvdrum: dimacus: I've spent many hours making the Ruby parser not suck so badly.  And it's still pretty terrible performance-wise.
[2013-10-07 12:59:39] dimacus: touche
[2013-10-07 13:00:00] nirvdrum: YAML has pathological cases that just can't perform that well.  Really nice to author, really shitty to implement.
[2013-10-07 13:00:00] dimacus: i was going for usability not performance per se
[2013-10-07 13:00:15] jleyba: if i'm going to store config in plain text, i'll just go with json

[2013-10-07 13:00:45] nirvdrum: In Ruby, I use a lib called VCR that records web requests/responses and stores in YAML.  I had YAML parsing taking a solid 15% of my entire test suite.
[2013-10-07 13:02:14] lord12341: nirvdrum: can you get VCR to interact with the webdriver instance?

[2013-10-07 13:03:03] nirvdrum: lord12341: You could record a WD session and use that for future tests.  But the idea is to stub out a real request.
