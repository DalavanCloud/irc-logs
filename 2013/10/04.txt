[2013-10-04 04:47:20] liberus: thanks for answer
[2013-10-04 04:47:34] detronizator_: is there another QtWebkit that tou can control with WebDriver?
[2013-10-04 04:47:38] detronizator_: that is news to me
[2013-10-04 04:47:40] detronizator_: link?
[2013-10-04 04:48:14] detronizator_: because QtWebKit is NOT a browser by itself
[2013-10-04 04:48:23] detronizator_: it's a library, a wrapper, a "flavour" of webkit
[2013-10-04 04:48:26] liberus: that's why I said nevermind)
[2013-10-04 04:48:31] detronizator_: and probably is going to become QtBlink at some point

[2013-10-04 04:48:48] *AutomatedTester is curious'
[2013-10-04 04:49:02] andreastt: FWIW QtWebKit is deprecated now.
[2013-10-04 04:49:07] andreastt: Or going to be fairly soon.
[2013-10-04 04:49:19] AutomatedTester: why?
[2013-10-04 04:49:30] andreastt: They're replacing it in favour of QtWebEngine, which is a much higher-level binding to Blink AFAIK.
[2013-10-04 04:49:43] liberus: it will be with QT5.3
[2013-10-04 04:49:53] AutomatedTester: but WebKit is still an engine so why deprecate

[2013-10-04 06:53:24] cgoldberg: p00j4, you are running on a remotre machine with no display
[2013-10-04 06:53:27] llaskin: do you have XVFB setup?
[2013-10-04 06:53:31] cgoldberg: is it linux?
[2013-10-04 06:53:53] cgoldberg: you need to integrate a virtual display.. like Xvfb (X virtual frame buffer)
[2013-10-04 06:54:02] p00j4: my machine is windows
[2013-10-04 06:54:16] llaskin: p00j4:  you are runnnig jenkins on windows?
[2013-10-04 06:54:26] p00j4: but I have pushed code on git and given the location of git project in Jenkins
[2013-10-04 06:54:40] cgoldberg: p00j4, the remote machine is also windows?
[2013-10-04 06:54:41] p00j4: yes llaskin
[2013-10-04 06:55:01] p00j4: no remote machine is linux
[2013-10-04 06:55:07] llaskin: right
[2013-10-04 06:55:11] cgoldberg: p00j4, then see my previous comment
[2013-10-04 06:55:16] cgoldberg: you need to add xvfb-run
[2013-10-04 06:55:18] llaskin: so the remote machine needs to be running XVFB/some sort of head
[2013-10-04 06:55:18] p00j4: build tool is maven
[2013-10-04 06:55:21] cgoldberg: as a build step in Jenkins
[2013-10-04 06:56:29] p00j4: means we need to install  XVFB on the remote machine?
[2013-10-04 06:56:30] cgoldberg: p00j4, read this:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb   .. then install xvfb on Jenkins slave... then use Xvfb plugin for Jenkins.. or add xvfb-run as a build step
[2013-10-04 06:58:01] cgoldberg: p00j4, the problem is your build server has no display setup (it's headless)... so the browser has no display to launch into.  the solution is a virtual display (Xvfb)
[2013-10-04 06:58:41] cgoldberg: p00j4, what Linux distro is it running?

[2013-10-04 07:07:51] cgoldberg: the remote doesn't
[2013-10-04 07:07:54] cgoldberg: thats the problem
[2013-10-04 07:07:59] cgoldberg: so use Xvfb
[2013-10-04 07:08:04] p00j4: now we are integrating jenkins with it so deployed code on git and able to get code in jenkins
[2013-10-04 07:08:11] cgoldberg: everyone hits this problem.. its not a big deal
[2013-10-04 07:08:12] p00j4: given path of AUT
[2013-10-04 07:08:44] p00j4: remote is also having Firefox
[2013-10-04 07:08:46] cgoldberg: p00j4, i understand the problem perfectly.. and have given you the same answer 3 times..
[2013-10-04 07:08:56] cgoldberg: USE XVFB

[2013-10-04 07:09:54] p00j4: but , its headless  right?
[2013-10-04 07:10:00] cgoldberg: p00j4, yes
[2013-10-04 07:10:33] Dude-X: xvfb stands for X window Virtual Frame Buffer

[2013-10-04 07:11:08] p00j4: isn't there alternative
[2013-10-04 07:11:47] Dude-X: it's not pure headless
[2013-10-04 07:11:54] Dude-X: it can still save images
[2013-10-04 07:12:01] Dude-X: you can combine with vnc
[2013-10-04 07:12:04] Dude-X: and still get a gui
[2013-10-04 07:12:14] Dude-X: but vnc is not necessary

[2013-10-04 07:12:29] llaskin: oh wait
[2013-10-04 07:12:29] llaskin: there is
[2013-10-04 07:12:30] llaskin: run the script on a physical machine

[2013-10-04 07:14:55] andreastt: p0deje: It's implied in the name that it's virtual, basically it's an indirection of the X server's output.  Instead of writing to your monitor it writes to a temporary buffer.
[2013-10-04 07:16:51] StephenBuckley: p00j4 here's a good simple guide for getting XVFB and FF working on Ubuntu-- didn't catch what you're trying to run it on
[2013-10-04 07:16:54] StephenBuckley: http://www.installationpage.com/selenium/how-to-run-selenium-headless-firefox-in-ubuntu/
[2013-10-04 07:17:23] *andreastt realizes that the word “headless” is really misleading in this context'
[2013-10-04 07:17:49] StephenBuckley: andreastt: how so?
[2013-10-04 07:18:15] p00j4: @ llaskin : we want to runn on local machine but with jenkins, don't know how to set it up
[2013-10-04 07:19:24] p00j4: only AUT is on remote machine, which we are accessing via ip address in our script
[2013-10-04 07:19:42] andreastt: StephenBuckley: A program run in Xvfb doesn't prevent a program from doing layout operations or drawing the window.
[2013-10-04 07:20:20] andreastt: When I think of headless, I'd expect it to actually circumvent the overhead of drawing.

[2013-10-04 07:21:13] mansi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-04 07:21:23] andreastt: So the xvfb is really just an indirection, although I suspect X is probably doing some clever things while the program is run in the background idling.
[2013-10-04 07:21:29] andreastt: Yep.

[2013-10-04 07:23:54] llaskin: why would you run on a local machine with jenkins?
[2013-10-04 07:23:56] llaskin: whjat a waste of time!
[2013-10-04 07:25:33] Dude-X: in jenkins your script might have the command to start the xvfb server with a display size, then you export the DISPLAY environment variable and then run your script to start webdrier

[2013-10-04 10:19:49] jimevans: i was trying to figure out if the error was in the actual finding of the IWebBrowser2 object when the browser is instantiated, or if it's a more generic failure in another command. this sounds like the latter.
[2013-10-04 10:20:30] StephenBuckley: yeah- it actually accomplishes a few things before this error crops up
[2013-10-04 10:20:30] timbo1, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2013-10-04 10:20:33] jimevans: and yeah, the IE driver leaks global atoms too. or more correctly, active accessibility does, which is how we hook into the browser's COM objects.
[2013-10-04 10:20:43] StephenBuckley: COM?
[2013-10-04 10:21:14] StephenBuckley: ah, I see
[2013-10-04 10:21:18] jimevans: COM == "Common Object Model"

[2013-10-04 10:48:33] StephenBuckley: dimacus: totally doable
[2013-10-04 10:48:50] dimacus: sweet!
[2013-10-04 10:49:10] dimacus: i know how to do it on a Mac but i haven't used windows in so long i lost all of my kung fu
[2013-10-04 10:49:16] StephenBuckley: haha
[2013-10-04 10:49:47] jimevans: StephenBuckley: so most of the time, when you get that error message from the IE driver, the problem is that we can't find the object we're looking for.
[2013-10-04 10:50:31] jimevans: see, we keep a hashmap of internal browser IDs to actual browser object.s
[2013-10-04 10:51:14] jimevans: every command you execute takes the currently "focused" window ID, and tries to find the appropriate browser object in that map.
[2013-10-04 10:51:20] jimevans: if it fails, you'll get that error.
[2013-10-04 10:51:26] StephenBuckley: oooooookay
[2013-10-04 10:51:58] StephenBuckley: that means that if any other browser has focus then the IEDriver won't be able to get the correct browser object?
[2013-10-04 10:52:00] jimevans: we could probably get some more information about what's failing by ratcheting up the logging level on the IE driver.
[2013-10-04 10:52:10] StephenBuckley: sure! how can I do that?
[2013-10-04 10:52:16] jimevans: no, that's why i put "focus" in scare quotes.
[2013-10-04 10:52:22] StephenBuckley: k
[2013-10-04 10:52:59] jimevans: every driver has the concept of a "currently focused window". it's the window to which commands are routed, and why you have to do driver.switchTo().window() to go to a different popup window.
[2013-10-04 10:53:29] StephenBuckley: right
[2013-10-04 10:53:46] StephenBuckley: I've messed around with multiple windows per session on the FF driver
[2013-10-04 10:53:54] StephenBuckley: but I'm not doing anything like that ATM
[2013-10-04 10:54:28] jimevans: anyway, if you're using java, there should be capabilities you can add for increasing the logging level, but i not entirely confident i could just tell you how to do that.
[2013-10-04 10:54:42] StephenBuckley: I'm using the facebook php webdriver
[2013-10-04 10:55:43] jimevans1, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-04 10:56:00] StephenBuckley: I'll poke around and see if I can find some more logging levels- I have some logging about what I'm doing at the Wire Protocol level
[2013-10-04 10:56:04] jimevans1: StephenBuckley: sorry, i'm on a plane at the moment, and i'm going to have to drop off soon.
[2013-10-04 10:56:17] StephenBuckley: no sweat- living your life is acceptable
[2013-10-04 10:56:18] jimevans1: no, this would be outside the wire protocol.
[2013-10-04 10:56:29] StephenBuckley: right, this would be internal to the IEDriverServer
[2013-10-04 10:57:16] jimevans1: logging in the IE driver is accomplished by passing command line switches to IEDriverServer.exe. there are ways to tell the java remote server to tack on these switches when it launches the exe, but i don't remember what they are.
[2013-10-04 10:57:41] StephenBuckley: I think I read something about this recently on the wiki- I'll track it down and letcha know the next time we're both on here
[2013-10-04 10:57:58] StephenBuckley: thanks for listening/helping out so far!

[2013-10-04 12:35:09] klrmn: cgoldberg: well, it may or may not achieve the goal i was hoping to achieve by using htmlunit rather that firefox. i needed a browser implementation that the app under test would identify as not supporting drag-and-drop, so that it would give me a normal file picker rather than a 'drag your file onto the browser window'
[2013-10-04 12:35:43] klrmn: cgoldberg: i dispaired of digging thru 42 javascript files to figure out what javascript magic i needed to do (since i speak javascript not at all)

[2013-10-04 12:38:01] cgoldberg: klrmn, interesting.. I'm not sure if phatom supports drag and drop.. i suppose it does though.  what about disabling javascript in firefox for that test?  would it then fall back to non drag-n-drop and still funtion?
[2013-10-04 12:38:49] klrmn: cgoldberg: not a bad idea…i'll have to figure out how to do that
[2013-10-04 12:38:59] cgoldberg: klrmn, and how does it detect support for drag n drop.. some javascript magic, or something else?

[2013-10-04 12:39:43] cgoldberg: klrmn, it's easy.. you set javascript to be disabled in a custom profile, and pass that to Firefox driver constructor.
[2013-10-04 12:39:56] cgoldberg: klrmn, give that a shot.. i bet it works for ya ;)

[2013-10-04 12:41:20] StephenBuckley: I can set it for a node, but then it overwrites the file with each test :/
[2013-10-04 12:41:39] cgoldberg: klrmn, or instead of custom profile, use DesiredCapabilities.. set javascriptEnabled to False
[2013-10-04 12:42:06] klrmn: cgoldberg: yeah, i figured. it's just something i'll have to look up…haven't had to deal with it much

[2013-10-04 14:39:36] lukeis: i helped some other guys at my work make it work… basically just treat it like a textarea… .sendKeys works
[2013-10-04 14:40:13] klrmn: chrismcmahon: doesn't sound much like fun, unless you copy it's contents into buffer, edit them, clear the field, and sendKeys it back
[2013-10-04 14:41:16] lukeis: d345ff  made it work… so you need 2.33+  :)
[2013-10-04 14:41:16] selbot2: 03lukeis 5 months ago - content editable div's (or other html elements) do not have a value attribute. | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=d345ff1 | http://dashboard.ci.seleniumhq.org/#/revision/d345ff1c8e239a3bb39808cfe5e2d27a87bf1b3f
[2013-10-04 14:44:07] chrismcmahon: lukeis klrmn thanks, that's a good picture of the state of the practice I guess.  In particular, right now I'm futzing with the new WYSIWYG editor for Wikipedia and how it keeps track of where the cursor is....
[2013-10-04 14:45:53] chrismcmahon: lukeis klrmn what I find is that rational combinations of sendKeys, onfocus, onkeydown, onkeyup etc. are not triggering some of the deep magic and the cursor position goes haywire in certain circumstances.  manual operation is (mostly) OK
[2013-10-04 14:46:39] lukeis: check if there's any difference using the Actions class to do the sending of keys
