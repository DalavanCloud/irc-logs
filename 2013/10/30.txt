[2013-10-30 05:07:36] therealfakemoot: Okay. Given the following selenium code (https://gist.github.com/therealfakemoot/2258fecf52f22dfa2c3a) the logIn function runs without throwing errors against (http://dev.playvs.net/app_dev.php/) but the submit button is never clicked
[2013-10-30 05:07:53] therealfakemoot: Er
[2013-10-30 05:08:37] therealfakemoot: Okay, so the submit button never gets clicked
[2013-10-30 05:08:46] therealfakemoot: causing the rest of my code to fail loudly
[2013-10-30 05:09:28] Dave_B_: looks commented out to me
[2013-10-30 05:09:34] therealfakemoot: Dave_B_: I updated teh gist
[2013-10-30 05:09:45] therealfakemoot: Dave_B_: it is not commented out in the current version of the code
[2013-10-30 05:09:50] Dave_B_: ah ok, was going to say that was an easy one ;)
[2013-10-30 05:14:15] Dave_B_: heh, don't click the login button without entering username/password!

[2013-10-30 05:15:43] Dave_B_: i take it you've checked the submit_btn is the right one? Given it's taking the first in a list of results....
[2013-10-30 05:15:47] therealfakemoot: Yep
[2013-10-30 05:16:10] therealfakemoot: The really insane thing is that when that submit_btn.click() is called, it clicks the link for the playvs itunes app
[2013-10-30 05:16:25] therealfakemoot: nowhere at all contained within the login form div that I'm doing a relative xpath from
[2013-10-30 05:16:37] Dave_B_: hmmm
[2013-10-30 05:16:48] Dave_B_: try swapping xpath to css selector and see if the same happens?
[2013-10-30 05:16:51] therealfakemoot: m
[2013-10-30 05:16:53] therealfakemoot: hm
[2013-10-30 05:16:57] Dave_B_: i've had issues previously with xpath going wonky within an element
[2013-10-30 05:17:05] Dave_B_: not a good answer, but worth trying
[2013-10-30 05:17:08] therealfakemoot: Yeah
[2013-10-30 05:17:46] therealfakemoot: I can do that.

[2013-10-30 07:32:11] ato: While I agree with what's being said in the hangout discussion, a few Selenium tests will get you very far in coverage.

[2013-10-30 07:32:53] therealfakemoot: That's very true
[2013-10-30 07:33:02] ato: Of course I'm not saying it's ideal, but I've been working on several projects where there's simply not been time to write tests.
[2013-10-30 07:33:09] therealfakemoot: That's my goal
[2013-10-30 07:33:27] therealfakemoot: To provide even a small suite of tests that cover the like40% of functionality that a user will need every time they visit
[2013-10-30 07:33:40] ato: Yup.
[2013-10-30 07:34:27] ato: My usual approach is to write a few important integration tests to make sure the core functionality is working, then fill out with lower-level unit tests underway.
[2013-10-30 07:35:11] therealfakemoot: Once I can show my bosses that automated testing can essentially provide more billable hours NOT spent making sure shit that used to work still works

[2013-10-30 07:36:42] Dave_B_: my boss is under the impression that automated tests should cover every single aspect of every single feature in the product to the most minute detail :(
[2013-10-30 07:37:06] Dave_B_: pointless coverage causing more maintenance and little value, a win-win situation!
[2013-10-30 07:37:08] ato: Not everything is important is my point of view.

[2013-10-30 09:11:26] cmcgraw, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-30 09:12:59] Dave_B_: (0 is the first entry in a list, so asking for index 1 is asking for the second entry)
[2013-10-30 09:13:39] brockfredin: Right.  I know that.  But, it's within a try/catch.  It should just catch the exception.
[2013-10-30 09:13:56] Dave_B_: you've told it what type of exception to catch
[2013-10-30 09:14:03] Dave_B_: 'catch (NoSuchElementException e)'
[2013-10-30 09:14:13] Dave_B_: so it'll only catch that type of exception
[2013-10-30 09:14:27] Dave_B_: not an IndexOutOfBoundsException
[2013-10-30 09:14:35] Dave_B_: you could catch that too and return false if you like
[2013-10-30 09:15:54] brockfredin: Dave_B_ Let me try.
[2013-10-30 09:16:06] Dave_B_: so after your first catch jsut go catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException) { return false; }
[2013-10-30 09:17:29] brockfredin: Okay.  Got past that error.  Thanks for that.
[2013-10-30 09:19:35] brockfredin: Since that element is not found.  All this is within a scope of a foreach in Java.  How do I move to the next index of the for each when it's not found?
[2013-10-30 09:19:49] jimevans: brockfredin: you'd be far better off testing for that rather than catching the exception.
[2013-10-30 09:20:34] jimevans: also, it won't work the way you want it to work. findElements doesn't throw NoSuchElementException if it doesn't find the element.
[2013-10-30 09:22:35] brockfredin: jimevans Yeah.  I'm taking a data dump from the database and testing each profile.  We have occasional null values.  I can just log those and move on.
[2013-10-30 09:22:55] brockfredin: i'll just remove the no such element catch.

[2013-10-30 09:25:52] lukeis: your for loop would need to use an index variable instead…. for (int i=0; i < something; i++)
[2013-10-30 09:26:57] lukeis: look-ahead is really only useful if you're parsing a string in my experience :)
[2013-10-30 09:27:25] lukeis: or parsing a data structure of some kind i suppose

[2013-10-30 09:29:02] brockfredin: I can't use the iterator at all?  To move to the next?  Ugh.
[2013-10-30 09:30:16] jimevans: if you're in the foreach, you'll get moving to the next value for free.
[2013-10-30 09:31:40] jimevans: but the point is that your isElementPresent method is taking an index, but you're always hard-coding that index to 1 (in the example you provided). i'm not sure that's the behavior you really want.
[2013-10-30 09:31:56] brockfredin: jimevans If a null record is found, I need to skip that index within the iterator, and move to hte next.
[2013-10-30 09:32:24] jleyba: for (foo : iterable) { if (foo == null) continue; }
[2013-10-30 09:33:41] brockfredin: If I don't, it continues moving onto check that profile to make sure it's valid, and since it's a null record, it will get nosuchelements found.  Continue keyword doesn't work.

[2013-10-30 12:31:36] jleyba: Yeah, that's the problem.  Selenium tests are green, but I've got tests here that fail with that change.
[2013-10-30 12:32:00] jleyba: Having a really hard time getting a reduced test case
[2013-10-30 12:32:06] barancev: and you see I've enabled many tests that failed before this change
[2013-10-30 12:32:37] barancev: what I think is: we have to implement scrolling for synthesized events too
[2013-10-30 12:32:39] lytrogeek, changing nick to eanxgeek|log.
[2013-10-30 12:33:18] jleyba: I've got one test that doesn't need scrolling.  Should just be a simple mouseover, check event handler did something, mouse out
[2013-10-30 12:33:39] jleyba: The mouseover gets triggered, but the element never responds to the mouseout
[2013-10-30 12:34:23] jleyba: of course, I just wrote a reduced test case that does just that and it passes... which brings us back to the "you're killing me" bit :)

[2013-10-30 13:36:49] barancev: a question: if we pass a desired capablity nativeEvents=true , but the FF version does not support native events -- what should be the value of the preference webdriver_enable_native_events ?
[2013-10-30 13:38:18] barancev: should it be set to the desired or the actual capability?
[2013-10-30 13:39:40] barancev: what's the purpose of this preference at all?
[2013-10-30 13:40:05] lukeis: if it's not available the driver returned with have capabilities with native events = false
[2013-10-30 13:40:06] barancev: it seems to be a vestige
[2013-10-30 13:40:13] lukeis: it's 'desired' ;)
[2013-10-30 13:40:23] lukeis: still up to the implementor to 'require' it
[2013-10-30 13:40:24] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-30 13:41:10] lukeis: as for what we *should* do… well, i don't actually care… native events is false for everything i do
[2013-10-30 13:41:11] barancev: so the issue is that driver.getCapability() returns the desired capability, not the actual one
[2013-10-30 13:41:33] lukeis: that should return the actual one
[2013-10-30 13:41:42] lukeis: and currently does
[2013-10-30 13:42:16] barancev: no it does not. value of 'webdriver_enable_native_events' overrides the value returned by Utils.getNativeEvents()
[2013-10-30 13:42:16] lukeis: repro case, otherwise I'm not convinced :)
