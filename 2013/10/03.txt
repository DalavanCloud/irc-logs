[2013-10-03 11:34:02] dimacus: mehwork: i always used excel my friend… easy to keep track of, and forces you to be brief (my opinion, too many words are deadly for a test case)
[2013-10-03 11:34:33] Dude-X: mehwork: at work we use google docs, at a prior job we used media wiki
[2013-10-03 11:34:40] Dude-X:  i am partial to media wiki due to formatting capabilities
[2013-10-03 11:34:47] Dude-X: but tables are hairy to deal with
[2013-10-03 11:35:12] mehwork: so 1 vote for spread sheets and 1 vote for docs?

[2013-10-03 11:36:19] mehwork: like 'service X on site.com is what all the kids are using'. But if not i'll probably stick to word docs since i don't know how i'd do that with excell
[2013-10-03 11:36:20] lukeis: salesforce uses saleforce ;)  we keep objects called 'Test Cases' in it and they are marked either manual or automated
[2013-10-03 11:36:25] dimacus: actually i personally belive in simplest solution possible… what i've done before is on the back of the "story" cards on the board i'd add some test cases
[2013-10-03 11:36:34] dimacus: this way you have new story and test case together
[2013-10-03 11:36:41] mehwork: does salesforce have a free version
[2013-10-03 11:36:55] *dimacus chuckles at lukeis'
[2013-10-03 11:37:00] lukeis: for non-profits ;)
[2013-10-03 11:37:50] Dude-X: mehwork: do what makes sense to you one. get a consensus from your coworkers if need be.
[2013-10-03 11:38:45] cgoldberg: mehwork, check out Moztrap
[2013-10-03 11:39:34] cgoldberg: it's a repository.. can be used for writing text test cases.. easy to setup a server.. open source.. etc.. from mozilla
[2013-10-03 11:39:50] mehwork: 'consensus from coworkers' usually means not doing anything
[2013-10-03 11:40:11] mehwork: because most people are lazy sons of b******
[2013-10-03 11:40:37] dimacus: mehwork:  agreed… this is why stay away from any expensive comercial stuff
[2013-10-03 11:40:38] mehwork: cgoldberg: interesting. thx
[2013-10-03 11:40:39] cgoldberg: mehwork.. moztrap is perfect for your use case
[2013-10-03 11:41:06] cgoldberg: it can also integrate with automated tests.. for results, tracking, etc
[2013-10-03 11:41:18] dimacus: like what was that TestSuite or something like that… 20k in the hole and you can't get anyone to do anything b/c it takes 30 steps to make a test case
[2013-10-03 11:41:26] Dude-X: we might use moztrap at our work.
[2013-10-03 11:41:37] cgoldberg: Dude-X.. do it.. it's been useful
[2013-10-03 11:41:39] Dude-X: but that depends on my coworker spearheading that erffort
[2013-10-03 11:42:40] mehwork: one automated test question now... if all i want to do is check if my web app is up (e.g., the user can see something and there's no 'blank page') is selenium good for that?
[2013-10-03 11:43:00] mehwork: i need something that can email alert me
[2013-10-03 11:43:12] mehwork: i was thinking a screen scraper that can email would work if not
[2013-10-03 11:43:54] cgoldberg: mehwork, just use and http library
[2013-10-03 11:44:09] cgoldberg: no need to fire up a browser and use selenium for a http check
[2013-10-03 11:44:18] mehwork: yeah
[2013-10-03 11:44:22] cgoldberg: mehwork, setup Nagios
