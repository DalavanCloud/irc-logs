[2013-10-21 04:16:28] barancev: davehunt: you as an "official IDE maintainer" can know why in webdriver formatters 'pause' command is skipped?
[2013-10-21 04:17:19] barancev: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/ide/main/src/content/formats/webdriver.js#L20
[2013-10-21 04:18:12] davehunt: probably just because there's no simple equivalent in WebDriver.. you'd need to sleep in the client language, which would also require additional imports

[2013-10-21 04:20:14] barancev: and I worder why webdriver formatters don't do the same
[2013-10-21 04:20:17] davehunt: If the RC formatters do it, then I don't see why the WD wouldn't

[2013-10-21 05:57:27] davehunt: what's the difference? it's built daily and you'll get automatic updates
[2013-10-21 05:57:43] davehunt: aurora and nightly are both build daily
[2013-10-21 05:57:50] jimevans: aurora should (theoretically) be more stable, no?
[2013-10-21 05:57:53] davehunt: yes
[2013-10-21 05:58:00] jimevans: okay then.
[2013-10-21 05:58:09] davehunt: development goes into nightly, and after 6 weeks is merged to aurora
[2013-10-21 05:58:56] jimevans: okay. i thought i'd seen where AutomatedTester's latest marionette patch had been merged into aurora, and had stuck.

[2013-10-21 06:07:19] davehunt: so should be in the latest builds.. if it had been backed out again that bug would say so
[2013-10-21 06:07:51] jimevans: oh. nvm/.
[2013-10-21 06:07:52] davehunt: jimevans: that should link to the latest from the FTP site
[2013-10-21 06:07:57] jimevans: i see i can force an update.
[2013-10-21 06:10:44] jimevans: yep. looks like it hasn't been promoted fully yet. the json responses aren't right. nightly works though.

[2013-10-21 06:44:58] Jamesons: how do you get a element with xpath using id AND the text it contains? "..By.xpath("//div[@id='whatever'"); and somehow put text()='whatever' in that?
[2013-10-21 06:45:27] barancev: so imho synthesized are better. unless something in your app works with native events only :)

[2013-10-21 06:50:15] jimevans: barancev: should be.
[2013-10-21 06:50:56] cgoldberg: it definitely defaults to native on 2.37 with FF24.. on Linux
[2013-10-21 06:51:36] jimevans: cgoldberg: what language binding?
[2013-10-21 06:51:43] cgoldberg: jimevans, python
[2013-10-21 06:52:15] jimevans: ah. that's why. the langauge bindings may differ in what's the default and what's not. java and .net default to synthetic events on linux for firefox
[2013-10-21 06:52:36] cgoldberg: native events are also not working properly when I run under Xvfb... something new.. never had a prob before

[2013-10-21 07:39:55] nimeacuerdo: Just finished a nice chat with some other devs
[2013-10-21 07:40:16] nimeacuerdo: regarding doing assertions against the database in selenium ui tests
[2013-10-21 07:41:00] nimeacuerdo: there seem to be strong, opposed opinions about this stuff
[2013-10-21 07:42:19] corinna0_, changing nick to corinna000.
[2013-10-21 07:42:21] nimeacuerdo: doing those assertions about stuff being created in the database, or notified to a sms provider, or some other external system… in a selenium ui test, and making it fail if those assertions fail
[2013-10-21 07:43:02] nimeacuerdo: would like to know your thoughts on this given that you are more than used to developing such ui tests
[2013-10-21 07:43:10] corinna000, changing nick to corinna000_.
[2013-10-21 07:43:21] jimevans: nimeacuerdo: depends on the purpose of the test.

[2013-10-21 07:44:26] jimevans: nimeacuerdo: if it's *only* doing ui functionality verification (which would imply a mocked up database implementation), i could see the argument against doing assertions against database state.

[2013-10-21 07:45:02] jimevans: and, ideally, in a correctly designed and architected system, you should have separate component-level tests for that anyway.

[2013-10-21 07:46:43] nimeacuerdo: "ok, invitiation sent"
[2013-10-21 07:46:50] jimevans: however, in an end-to-end test, where you're driving the entire system, soup-to-nuts, you'll want to be able to validate everything in the system.
[2013-10-21 07:47:16] jimevans: but these tests should be few in number.
[2013-10-21 07:47:25] jimevans: (relatively speaking)
[2013-10-21 07:47:50] nimeacuerdo: but some people argue that  the ui tests should also verify that some stuff is inserted in the db, and that some email system is notified also
[2013-10-21 07:48:28] jimevans: no, i disagree. only in the end-to-end case. and again, there should be relatively few of those.
[2013-10-21 07:48:32] nimeacuerdo: so yes, it's probably more a discussion about black box ui validation test VS full end-to-end
[2013-10-21 07:48:35] jimevans: i agree there's a place for that kind of test.
[2013-10-21 07:49:06] jimevans: every end-to-end test would be a ui test, but not every ui test will be an end-to-end test.

[2013-10-21 14:33:00] jimevans: (with iframes, only name fails)
[2013-10-21 14:33:10] jimevans: and the symptoms are different.
[2013-10-21 14:33:23] jimevans: the iframe-by-name case closes down the socket.
[2013-10-21 14:33:24] AutomatedTester: raise 1 and then I can split if need be
[2013-10-21 14:33:28] AutomatedTester: wait
[2013-10-21 14:33:30] AutomatedTester: jimevans:
[2013-10-21 14:33:37] AutomatedTester: raise 1 for iframe
[2013-10-21 14:33:42] bsilverberg: sorry lukeis, was debugging
[2013-10-21 14:33:42] AutomatedTester: raise 1 for <frameset>
[2013-10-21 14:33:42] jimevans: all of the frames cases just return a "no such frame error"
[2013-10-21 14:33:49] bsilverberg: I believe the problem is with http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/py/selenium/webdriver/support/select.py#129
[2013-10-21 14:33:51] jimevans: yep.
[2013-10-21 14:33:56] jimevans: that's what i'll do then.
[2013-10-21 14:34:01] AutomatedTester: also wasnt frameset deprecated in HTML5?
[2013-10-21 14:34:23] AutomatedTester: and vbscript was dropped from IE11
[2013-10-21 14:34:27] jimevans: probably? but will firefox 27+ continue to render them?
[2013-10-21 14:34:35] AutomatedTester: probably...
[2013-10-21 14:34:39] jimevans: if so, we need to be able to automated them, no?
[2013-10-21 14:34:45] bsilverberg: lukeis: that line is now returning false and causing an exception to be thrown whereas before it wasn't being tested and everything worked (as far as we could tell, anyway)
[2013-10-21 14:34:54] AutomatedTester: renders get a lot of shit and browsers try their best to render
[2013-10-21 14:35:06] AutomatedTester: renderers even
[2013-10-21 14:35:09] lukeis: bsilverberg: what are you passing in? and what does the select have?

[2013-10-21 14:36:36] bsilverberg: the select has u'Test Version 2013-10-21T21:31:16.761944'
[2013-10-21 14:36:47] bsilverberg: maybe it wasn't supposed to have worked?
[2013-10-21 14:37:02] jimevans: AutomatedTester: iframes - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=929161, frameset - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=929175
[2013-10-21 14:37:18] lukeis: bsilverberg: yeah, that should work then
[2013-10-21 14:37:27] bsilverberg: it doesn't
[2013-10-21 14:37:40] lukeis: selecting 'Test '  would make it work i think
[2013-10-21 14:37:45] bsilverberg: because of the == test
[2013-10-21 14:37:51] AutomatedTester: jimevans: its on my list

[2013-10-21 14:38:20] bsilverberg: lukeis: I think, looking at the code, that the == test messes it up, basically doing away with the contains
[2013-10-21 14:38:43] lukeis: yeah
[2013-10-21 14:38:55] bsilverberg: 2.37.1.1?

[2013-10-21 14:39:13] jimevans: AutomatedTester: cool. well, that's the extent of what i've done so far. the compliance of the protocol looks good so far. i can get rid of most of my hacks.
[2013-10-21 14:39:22] AutomatedTester: yay!
[2013-10-21 14:39:36] lukeis: bsilverberg: i don't know what the fix is
[2013-10-21 14:39:44] lukeis: and it would be 2.37.2 ;)
[2013-10-21 14:40:15] lukeis: bsilverberg: can you give me a more detailed what you expect to occur issue?
[2013-10-21 14:40:41] bsilverberg: I'm not sure I understand
[2013-10-21 14:40:57] lukeis: well, i don't understand what's failing exactly :)
[2013-10-21 14:41:29] lukeis: so given a select with options X,Y,Z  and calling select_by_visible_text(TEXT), I expect Y,Z to be selected?
[2013-10-21 14:41:41] lukeis: a few of those ^ would be helpful
[2013-10-21 14:42:12] bsilverberg: hmm, I don't really know what the expectations for select_by_visible_text are
[2013-10-21 14:42:20] lukeis: :)
[2013-10-21 14:42:24] bsilverberg: I've never encountered it before, tbh
[2013-10-21 14:42:31] bsilverberg: I just want my test to pass again ;)
[2013-10-21 14:42:43] lukeis: best to change your test to use a different way of selecting if possible
[2013-10-21 14:43:29] bsilverberg: you mean temporarily, or permanently

[2013-10-21 14:43:35] lukeis: permanently ;)

[2013-10-21 14:45:06] bsilverberg: hmm, I'm sure I can do that, but do you not think it's worth fixing it if it's broken?  I guess I should just open an issue and hope someone who knows more about the expectations will provide more info?
[2013-10-21 14:45:30] lukeis: if I have more info on how you think it's broken… then i can fix it ;)
[2013-10-21 14:45:47] lukeis: right now it doesn't look broken, looks like it *was previously* broken
[2013-10-21 14:46:09] ranju, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-21 14:46:15] bsilverberg: lukeis: that is true
[2013-10-21 14:46:37] bsilverberg: nowhere does it say that it can use a substring of the text
[2013-10-21 14:46:47] bsilverberg: but the code is there to support that
[2013-10-21 14:46:56] lukeis: yeah… i blame java ;)
[2013-10-21 14:46:56] bsilverberg: and it used to work, and now does not
[2013-10-21 14:47:03] bsilverberg: why java?
[2013-10-21 14:47:16] lukeis: this was a port to python of the Java logic that existed
[2013-10-21 14:47:40] bsilverberg: oh. ok, blame java. that's easy. and fun

[2013-10-21 14:48:27] barancev|2: jimevans: with the help of #6310 I've found an interesting bug in IE driver (checked in IE10) -- open a page, click a link that opens a new window, and while the new windows loads its content call driver.quit() -- it closes only first window!

[2013-10-21 14:49:14] bsilverberg: lukeis: that is strange
[2013-10-21 14:49:22] jimevans: detection of new windows is asynchronous in the IE driver.
[2013-10-21 14:49:32] lukeis: ranju: here's a partial list http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#properties  (keep in mind that hyphens are typically removed and the next character is then upper cased)
[2013-10-21 14:49:43] barancev|2: jimevans: but why driver.qiut() does not kill them all?
[2013-10-21 14:49:52] jimevans: or rather, opening of new windows on a click is asynchronous
[2013-10-21 14:50:00] bsilverberg: it does look like the same logic, but why would you bother to search using contains, and then basically ignore that contains by enforcing an equals test?

[2013-10-21 14:50:54] lukeis: bsilverberg: yup, and I have not a clue :)
[2013-10-21 14:51:06] ranju: lukeis: yeah, I was hoping to find a complete list...I guess that list would be in the driver code or the browser code?
[2013-10-21 14:51:08] jimevans: if quit gets called before the driver has a chance to add the newly opened window to its list of known windows, i'm not sure how it would be able to know to close them

[2013-10-21 14:51:46] lukeis: ranju: i say partial, because each browser can have other properties not defined in the w3c spec. you have to look it up per browser and would be in said browser's code. nothing to do with webdriver / selenium
