[2013-10-08 01:14:35] barancev: ah! I see. so you can either build the plugin from the source, or ping the author
[2013-10-08 01:14:55] Cliff123: I wrote him an email.
[2013-10-08 01:15:04] Cliff123: and I don't know how to build it from source

[2013-10-08 01:17:35] barancev: do you really need this plugin? do you already have a jenking cluster that meets your grid purposes?

[2013-10-08 02:39:33] CaptainHeavy: Hey everyone, I had an issue yesterday which I thought had been resolved after receiving help from a user in this room but when I've come to test the code again today its not working.  I'm trying to retrieve the value of a particular element that is set using a PHP variable using WebDriver.
[2013-10-08 02:40:48] CaptainHeavy: The Xpath I'm using to select the element is correct however, the WebDriver code that was working yesterday now appears to be failing.  I was wondering if anybody could help me come up with a more robust solution to the problem than the one I adopted yesterday.  The code I currently have to locate the desired element and retrieve its value is below
[2013-10-08 02:40:56] CaptainHeavy: String data = this.driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id='" + this.formIdentifier + "']//*[@id='" + dynamicDataTableId + "']//tr[" + i + "]//td[" + tableColumnContainingValueToMatch + "]")).getAttribute("value");
[2013-10-08 02:42:02] CaptainHeavy: An example of the Xpath this produces is: //*[@id='Default_Form_Company']//*[@id='dd-company-phone']//tr[1]//td[2]
[2013-10-08 02:42:52] CaptainHeavy: However, I just receive "null" when the Java code is executed.
[2013-10-08 02:44:51] Dave_B_: if it was working and now isn't is it possible that the value isn't set yet?
[2013-10-08 02:44:59] Dave_B_: as in there is a race condition?
[2013-10-08 02:45:35] Dave_B_: I've had pages that on first load didn't have values set but then got them set by JS after load completed, need to wait for them to have a value before reading it
[2013-10-08 02:46:20] Dave_B_: oh, that's a td too - are you sure there isn't an input inside the td that has the value? I seem to remember that from yesterday
[2013-10-08 02:47:43] CaptainHeavy: ahhhh, it could be that actually
[2013-10-08 02:47:58] CaptainHeavy: the td thing I mean
[2013-10-08 02:48:44] Dave_B_: :) hope thats it, makes more sense to be reading the value of an input!
[2013-10-08 02:50:57] CaptainHeavy: yeah it does, complete brain fart.  Just testing it now
[2013-10-08 02:51:18] Dave_B_: it's early, brain farts are allowed
[2013-10-08 02:51:29] Dave_B_: erm, or it's early here, no idea what time it is with you of course!
[2013-10-08 02:51:39] CaptainHeavy: I'm in the UK :)
[2013-10-08 02:51:42] *Dave_B_ wonders if nearly 11am still counts as early :S'
[2013-10-08 02:51:43] CaptainHeavy: 10:48
[2013-10-08 02:51:47] Dave_B_: :)
[2013-10-08 02:51:58] CaptainHeavy: awesome, its working again!
[2013-10-08 02:52:02] Dave_B_: woo :)
[2013-10-08 02:52:24] CaptainHeavy: Thank you very much :D
[2013-10-08 02:52:27] Dave_B_: no problem
[2013-10-08 02:52:44] CaptainHeavy: I was on the verge of quitting earlier haha
[2013-10-08 02:53:12] Dave_B_: :p it can be frustrating, and amazing how easy it is to overlook stuff
[2013-10-08 02:57:20] CaptainHeavy: Absolutely, I edited a small portion of the code yesterday (the last input parameter to create the Xpath expression) and I must have deleted the "input" part
[2013-10-08 02:58:37] Dave_B_: you could perhaps simplify your lookup btw, given you've got an id within an id'd element - just jump straight to the inner one.
[2013-10-08 02:59:13] CaptainHeavy: I could actually
[2013-10-08 02:59:22] CaptainHeavy: I'll do that now, cheers bud :)
[2013-10-08 02:59:33] Dave_B_: no worries
[2013-10-08 02:59:46] CaptainHeavy: Its within a form class so I felt it necessary to include the formIdentifier

[2013-10-08 03:30:23] CaptainHeavy: Dave_B_ I've put the method that contains the code I was discussing earlier in its own class.  Certain web elements have their own classes in this project and that's now a part of the "DynamicData" class.  Aids with readability since when you call the method you call it from instance of the class so in this case the "PhoneNumberDynamicData" instance

[2013-10-08 07:35:13] dimacus1: how about this… the Hurrican went by and destroyed the house of your worst enemy?
[2013-10-08 07:35:43] jimevans: man, you people are violent today! :)
[2013-10-08 07:36:18] dimacus1: no more than usual… having someone in a cheerful mood brings out the worst in us :-P
[2013-10-08 07:36:31] jimevans: haha
[2013-10-08 07:37:09] jimevans: so… phase 2. got to start gathering signatures now. all of you people move to the florida 12th and register to vote, pronto!
[2013-10-08 07:37:58] AutomatedTester: I had an interesting conversation on twitter with Santi where he thinks having a monarchy (even though they do nothing) is worse than having the government shutting down and people not getting paid or getting their benefits
[2013-10-08 07:38:13] dimacus1: jimevans:  http://www.jimevansforcongress.com/
[2013-10-08 07:38:14] dimacus1: ?
[2013-10-08 07:38:27] jimevans: no, that's a guy in missouri, i think
[2013-10-08 07:38:34] ibl_: worse? why?
[2013-10-08 07:38:49] jimevans: dimacus1: yep, missouri 7th
[2013-10-08 07:38:55] AutomatedTester: ibl_: I have no idea
[2013-10-08 07:39:08] dimacus1: AutomatedTester:  actually that's how my father thinks about communisim… he said that at least with communism people got their pensions on time, and no was was starving… unlike right after the fall of the union
[2013-10-08 07:39:10] ibl_: AutomatedTester: okay then.. ...
[2013-10-08 07:39:23] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: To be fair, santicyr doesn't really understand English :-)
[2013-10-08 07:40:09] jimevans: nirvdrum: "doesn't understand English", or "doesn't understand *the* English"?
[2013-10-08 07:40:13] jimevans: :)
[2013-10-08 07:40:29] nirvdrum: Heh.
[2013-10-08 07:40:35] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I guess Republicans don't really understand English too...
[2013-10-08 07:40:35] dimacus1: and by *the* English you mean *Queens English* right?
[2013-10-08 07:40:57] jimevans: dimacus1: articles matter!
[2013-10-08 07:41:03] dimacus1: ahhh
[2013-10-08 07:41:05] jimevans: so do commas, but that's another post.
[2013-10-08 07:41:07] nirvdrum: The Tea Party is tangentially Republican, but sure.
[2013-10-08 07:41:48] Oscar1: I dont understand commas or apostrophes
[2013-10-08 07:41:57] AutomatedTester: woop.... in a few hours I will be added to about:credits in firefox...
[2013-10-08 07:42:30] jimevans: Oscar1: commas are the difference between dinner and murder. ("Let's eat grandma" vs. "Let's eat, grandma")
[2013-10-08 07:42:32] liberus: I'll post again my question, as it looks like more people are there
[2013-10-08 07:42:34] liberus: (02:24:43 PM) liberus: Hi all! My team is currently working on open-sourcing some selenium based solution and I need someone, who we could write to, to know, what part of our work could be interested to selenium and integrated with it
[2013-10-08 07:42:34] liberus: (02:26:37 PM) liberus: Basically, we made driver that can test desktop, mobile qt-based applications
[2013-10-08 07:42:44] wilhelm: AutomatedTester: With the Tories and their populist buddies forming the new Norwegian government this month, I'm glad this is a monarchy. No matter how many douchebags they give their own ministries, there will _always_ be one respectable, sensible grown-up in the weekly cabinet meetings.
[2013-10-08 07:43:24] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Why were you not on there earlier?
[2013-10-08 07:43:24] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Relevant: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx2scvIFGjE
[2013-10-08 07:43:39] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I didnt fill in the form...
[2013-10-08 07:43:39] dimacus1: liberus:  that's pretty cool! i don't think i've ever seen a qt-based application to this point though :(
[2013-10-08 07:43:53] p_l: ibl_: To make it funnier, monarchy is fiscal positive in UK, afaik
[2013-10-08 07:44:18] AutomatedTester: p_l: they attract a lot of tourists which help
[2013-10-08 07:44:20] p_l: that is, it makes them more money than it takes to maintain it
[2013-10-08 07:44:34] liberus: dimacus1: yeah, but it looks like it's out of seleniums road
[2013-10-08 07:44:35] p_l: AutomatedTester: enough to completely offset whole royal family budget
[2013-10-08 07:44:39] AutomatedTester: yup
[2013-10-08 07:44:42] ibl_: :D
[2013-10-08 07:44:49] jimevans: liberus: i'm not sure there'd be a ton of interest in directly integrating native applications into the selenium project. it's got a pretty large scope already. having said that, there's room in the ecosystem for parallel projects that share the webdriver api (c.f., appium, ios-driver, selendroid, etc.)

[2013-10-08 07:45:04] AutomatedTester: and the Queen makes tries to make people pay for things
[2013-10-08 07:45:20] AutomatedTester: e.g. flights, utilities
[2013-10-08 07:45:24] p_l: AutomatedTester: and that's without taking into account possible positive psychological impact of having visible sign of stability...
[2013-10-08 07:45:34] dimacus1: AutomatedTester:  doesn't she technically own all the land also?
[2013-10-08 07:45:44] ibl_: personally I just find monarchies to be really strange in this day and age, but mostly I just don't care about them
[2013-10-08 07:45:46] dimacus1: liberus:  what will you call the project?
[2013-10-08 07:46:21] liberus: jimevans: yeah, we've seen them already and it looks like our way to do things, but there a lot of small(and not so small) changes in selenium that could be interesting for others
[2013-10-08 07:46:27] p_l: ibl_: technically you could say that british democracy is more modern than republican system... ;)
[2013-10-08 07:46:49] liberus: dimacus1: not shure yet, QtHybridDriver maybe
[2013-10-08 07:47:03] jimevans: liberus: most of the discussion of api changes would take place on the selenium developers' mailing list.
[2013-10-08 07:47:06] AutomatedTester: p_l: its because we, like the Norwegians, do a social democracy
[2013-10-08 07:47:13] jimevans: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selenium-developers
[2013-10-08 07:47:17] ibl_: p_l: might be, but the monarcs are really not that much related to the fuctioning democracy
[2013-10-08 07:47:21] dimacus1: liberus:  "CutieDriver"
[2013-10-08 07:47:34] p_l: ibl_: and democracy is not the only govt system out there
[2013-10-08 07:47:45] liberus: :)
[2013-10-08 07:47:48] p_l: (most importantly, a republik is not a democracy)
[2013-10-08 07:48:03] ibl_: p_l: yes.. I have heard something of the sort.
[2013-10-08 07:48:05] dimacus1: AutomatedTester:  p_l : related http://www.ted.com/talks/eric_x_li_a_tale_of_two_political_systems.html
[2013-10-08 07:48:18] p_l: ibl_: because there are two things people refer to as democracy
[2013-10-08 07:48:28] dimacus1: China vs Democracy
[2013-10-08 07:48:40] p_l: ibl_: the strict definition of democracy is only executed in nationwide referendums, technically
[2013-10-08 07:48:53] dimacus1: the guy claims politicians like Obama, or all of US congress would barely be "mayors" of small towns based on their skill set
[2013-10-08 07:49:20] liberus: guys, I know this all thing about "shutdown" is really important for all of you, but don't you think it's quite offtopic?
[2013-10-08 07:49:46] p_l: liberus: well, it's only important to me in terms of whether the financial market stays healthy
[2013-10-08 07:49:47] jimevans: liberus: yes, but this channel is social as well as technical. we're not sticklers about it here.
[2013-10-08 07:50:04] p_l: ... I hope we started dumping US bonds as fast as possible
[2013-10-08 07:50:09] liberus: ok
[2013-10-08 07:50:44] dimacus1: liberus:  it's morning, most ppl are still in chatty mood while sipping coffee… well except our friends over the pond… i don't know how he is even awake
[2013-10-08 07:51:01] p_l: hey, here it's 1550
[2013-10-08 07:51:14] ibl_: hey its 17:51
[2013-10-08 07:51:22] dimacus1: :-P
[2013-10-08 07:51:28] liberus: dimacus1: 17:51 for me too:)
[2013-10-08 07:51:41] ibl_: liberus: o/

[2013-10-08 07:52:24] ibl_: <murica/>
[2013-10-08 07:53:05] p_l: there is a reason why one of my wip stories gets US east coast turned into glassland ;)
[2013-10-08 07:53:17] liberus: ok, and quite back to selenium, isn't it quite wrong, that in JsonToWebElementConverter driver field is private? While we can implement and set our own JsonToWebElementConverter-based converter?
[2013-10-08 07:53:19] dimacus1: liberus:  as to your question, i doubt it will make into webdriver core code base
[2013-10-08 07:54:18] jimevans: liberus: that's a java-only implementation detail. you can't get hung up on that. webdriver != java
[2013-10-08 07:54:48] jimevans: (sorry, but that's my pet peeve, that people assume java is the only language used by webdriver users)
[2013-10-08 07:54:53] liberus: dimacus1: ok, ty, looks like we will create our own repo and send some interesting features to selenium
[2013-10-08 07:55:02] noahsussman, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-08 07:56:19] dimacus1: liberus:  yeah that seems to be the best approach… (again i don't have a commit bit just speaking from experience trying to add new features). Make seporate project, if you have a feature that is awesome to be in WD proper send the pull request and they will merge it
[2013-10-08 07:56:25] Dude-X, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-08 07:56:44] dimacus1: this way everyone gets new features, and the sticklers for purity stay happy
[2013-10-08 07:56:51] *dimacus1 coughs without pointing fingers'
[2013-10-08 07:57:43] dimacus1: Add a new feature to webdriver, and no one blinks… But try to commit 1/2 of Windows DLLs into the repo and everyone looses their shit :-P
[2013-10-08 07:57:46] jimevans: oi! point fingers all you like mate, i can take it! i'm in politics!
[2013-10-08 07:57:59] dimacus1: jimevans:  you got my vote
[2013-10-08 07:58:34] jimevans: dimacus1: every single one counts.
[2013-10-08 07:58:46] dimacus1: you got a website going yet?
[2013-10-08 07:58:55] jimevans: still in development.
[2013-10-08 07:58:55] liberus: jimevans: webdriver != java does it mean that my question is wrong?)
[2013-10-08 07:59:06] *p_l would love to vote on jimevans, for shits'n'giggles (and the fact I'd know how to hunt him down), but not US citizen :P'
[2013-10-08 07:59:07] jimevans: liberus: not necessarily.
[2013-10-08 07:59:45] jimevans: depends on the architecture of what you're trying to build.
[2013-10-08 08:00:18] liberus: jimevans: can't see your point... maybe missing smth
[2013-10-08 08:00:35] selenium33, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-10-08 08:01:32] jimevans: liberus: you want to implement your own something-or-other that's an internal implementation detail of the java language bindings. my point is that it's an internal implementation detail for a reason; other language bindings don't need to know or care how that gets done.
[2013-10-08 08:01:32] liberus: I mean, that in java JsonToWebElementConverter driver field is private, shouldn't it be protected?
[2013-10-08 08:02:58] liberus: jimevans: yeah, but I've made some changes in java bindings
[2013-10-08 08:03:11] liberus: and I needed my own JsonToWebElementConverter
[2013-10-08 08:03:15] ArSn, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)

[2013-10-08 08:03:56] dimacus1: liberus:  can't you sub-class it and overwrite whatever you don't like?
[2013-10-08 08:03:59] jimevans: liberus: okay, to what extent? and do you care about how other languages implement your changes? (if the answer to the second question is "no", you might want to rethink things.
[2013-10-08 08:04:16] *Dave_B_ wondered why one test was looping forever, now all becomes clear'
[2013-10-08 08:04:27] jimevans: dimacus1: +1 oop principles ftw!
[2013-10-08 08:04:38] Guest82529: hmm... [error] There was an unexpected Alert! [Database renewed!] command=WaitForAlert target-?
[2013-10-08 08:04:46] Guest82529: or how can I manage this error?
[2013-10-08 08:05:27] liberus: dimacus1: that's what I've done, but how could I do this without driver?)
[2013-10-08 08:07:13] dimacus1: liberus:  as in make your own class from 0?
[2013-10-08 08:09:06] jimevans: liberus: so you're descending from RemoteWebDriver, no?
[2013-10-08 08:09:19] liberus: jimevans: yeah
[2013-10-08 08:09:48] liberus: dimacus1: to much to rewrite, at least it looks like it
[2013-10-08 08:09:53] jimevans: okay, then in the "remote end" (or server-side) of your driver, i assume there's something that speaks json wire protocol, right?
[2013-10-08 08:10:02] liberus: yeah
[2013-10-08 08:10:50] jimevans: so in the serialized json responses of the json wire protocol, why isn't sending back { "ELEMENT": "<unique opaque element id>" } not good enough?
[2013-10-08 08:11:09] jimevans: what is it about the JsonToWebElementConverter that doesn't work for you?
[2013-10-08 08:11:43] liberus: our internal changes, basically we made api for video and audio playback controll
[2013-10-08 08:12:02] liberus: for html, qt widgets and qml
[2013-10-08 08:12:52] jimevans: yes, but that would all be on the server side, no? all your client side bindings should require for the conversion to a RemoteWebElement instance is that json object.
[2013-10-08 08:13:14] jimevans: you may need to extend the wire protocol to get your additional functionality on the server side, but that's doable
[2013-10-08 08:13:58] jimevans: unless, of course, your "local end" (language bindings) and "remote end" (server-side driver) are more tightly coupled than they ought to be to fit the webdriver model...
[2013-10-08 08:14:55] liberus: jimevans: the problem is, that while converting to RemoteWebElement it's usefull to know if this element supports our additional features

[2013-10-08 08:20:54] jimevans: sounds like your QtHybridDriver instance should be overriding execute(), and unwrapping element references to QtHybridElement instead of using the standard converter.
[2013-10-08 08:20:56] liberus: and make RemoteWebElement to some other element converter(maybe), but isn't it quite lame? I mean that for every such extension I'll need some additional classes and ...
[2013-10-08 08:23:00] jimevans: the .net bindings are a little easier to extend. there's a protected method (CreateElement), which is the single point of contact where RemoteWebElement instances are created from the response.

[2013-10-08 08:25:23] jimevans: oh! well there you go then.
[2013-10-08 08:25:29] jimevans: there's your answer.
[2013-10-08 08:25:32] jimevans: use the setter.
[2013-10-08 08:25:50] jimevans: create a subclass to JsonToWebElementConverter, and you're golden.
[2013-10-08 08:26:33] jimevans: in fact, you only need to override newRemoteWebElement() in your subclass.
[2013-10-08 08:26:38] liberus: how should I reference to driver then? is there a way that I can't see?

[2013-10-08 08:41:46] jimevans: fwiw, i subscribe to the adage that fields should (almost) always be private. if you need accessibility, use a setter or getter, and if one isn't provided, you shouldn't need it.

[2013-10-08 10:56:20] jimevans: llaskin: that jim evans is from the missouri 7th

[2013-10-08 10:57:04] lukeis: that jim evans *looks* like a republican ;)
[2013-10-08 10:57:08] jimevans: and more conservative.
[2013-10-08 10:57:31] dimacus1: cgoldberg:  i've made some investments in "social" companies

[2013-10-08 10:59:08] dimacus1: eh… 10% of $100 is only $10 so i'm not loosing any sleep
[2013-10-08 10:59:18] cgoldberg: id short facebook before i took a long position in it
[2013-10-08 10:59:19] dimacus1: still 10% sounds so much more devostating

[2013-10-08 11:02:23] dimacus1: like i said, not my money, free money, so so much easier to loose it without loosing sleep. Would probably have to pay $30 in taxes alone if i tried to withdraw it

[2013-10-08 11:59:56] Dude-X: for some reason plain strings don't work
[2013-10-08 12:00:13] lukeis: they don't? they do for me every time
[2013-10-08 12:00:26] denisesballs: yeah plain strings work fine
[2013-10-08 12:00:30] denisesballs: (for me)
[2013-10-08 12:00:36] Dude-X: ah maybe for Remote,
[2013-10-08 12:00:36] jimevans: even if you successfully send a javascriptEnabled capability in the desired capabilities, they're just that, *desired*.
[2013-10-08 12:00:37] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: it should work if you pass plainstrings since the code handles that for you
[2013-10-08 12:00:51] jimevans: no guarantee they'll be supported by the browser.

[2013-10-08 12:02:49] nirvdrum: Oh.  You mean how they make almost no sense whatsoever? :-D
[2013-10-08 12:02:57] jimevans: yep, that's the one.
[2013-10-08 12:03:00] denisesballs: since i cant disable JS, maybe you guys can think of a better folution to my problem. i'm trying to determine that two pages are mostly identical (basically that mod_rewrite works). however the pages can change after loading and that screws up my source comparison
[2013-10-08 12:03:23] nirvdrum: folution?  Is that old Englishe where an 'f' is used in place of an 's'?
[2013-10-08 12:03:25] denisesballs: solution*
[2013-10-08 12:03:27] denisesballs: lol
[2013-10-08 12:03:44] lukeis: denisesballs: do you need webdriver for that?
[2013-10-08 12:03:57] lukeis: requests can work for you ;)
[2013-10-08 12:04:04] denisesballs: lukeis: probably not, but it makes logging in easier
[2013-10-08 12:04:08] lukeis: or urllib2 if you're still using it
[2013-10-08 12:04:12] denisesballs: and i was already using it for the rest of the test
[2013-10-08 12:04:27] AutomatedTester: denisesballs: requests ftw

[2013-10-08 12:05:30] jimevans: damn you mobile IE!
[2013-10-08 12:06:14] denisesballs: can requests fill in a username/password field for auth (not htaccess)
[2013-10-08 12:06:16] therealfakemoot: I seem to be having trouble finding an actual listing of any of the verify/assert methods available with teh webdriver
[2013-10-08 12:06:31] jimevans: therealfakemoot: that's cause there aren't any.
[2013-10-08 12:06:32] cgoldberg: denisesballs, yes requests does basic auth
[2013-10-08 12:06:50] jimevans: therealfakemoot: use a testing framework for that (junit, testng, etc.)
[2013-10-08 12:06:57] therealfakemoot: um
[2013-10-08 12:07:06] lukeis: denisesballs: if your selenium test already did it, then grab the session id cookie from your driver and set the Cookie header using requests
[2013-10-08 12:07:14] therealfakemoot: Even though the docs mention, copiously using things like verifyText
[2013-10-08 12:07:15] therealfakemoot: and stuff
[2013-10-08 12:07:27] denisesballs: lukeis: that's pretty brilliant
[2013-10-08 12:07:40] jimevans: therealfakemoot: which docs? and are the specific to the webdriver api, or are they older, rc-based docs?
[2013-10-08 12:07:43] cgoldberg: therealfakemoot,  what language are you using?   "selenium" has some, but "webdriver" does not
[2013-10-08 12:07:47] therealfakemoot: jimevans: About to find out
[2013-10-08 12:08:08] therealfakemoot: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp
[2013-10-08 12:08:12] jimevans: cgoldberg: s/"selenium"/"selenium rc"/
[2013-10-08 12:08:16] therealfakemoot: And I'm writing in Python
[2013-10-08 12:08:18] jimevans: there i fixed it for you.
[2013-10-08 12:08:19] therealfakemoot: Python 2
[2013-10-08 12:08:31] cgoldberg: therealfakemoot, use unittest assertions
[2013-10-08 12:08:39] therealfakemoot: Interesting
[2013-10-08 12:09:05] therealfakemoot: I was wondering how and when I'd have to integrate this into an actual unittest thing
[2013-10-08 12:09:06] cgoldberg: therealfakemoot, webdriver isn't a testing/assertion framework.. it's an automation library for driving browsers
[2013-10-08 12:09:13] therealfakemoot: cgoldberg: That makes perfect sense
[2013-10-08 12:09:30] jimevans: therealfakemoot: looking on that page, i don't see any references to verifyText or the like.
[2013-10-08 12:09:32] therealfakemoot: I've just been confused by the pages mentioning these "verify/assert" methods
[2013-10-08 12:09:39] cgoldberg: therealfakemoot, so just use reular unittest from Python.. or nose.. or py.test.. or whatever
[2013-10-08 12:09:41] therealfakemoot: yeah

[2013-10-08 12:20:03] Dude-X: denisesballs: the cookies have unicode strings

[2013-10-08 12:20:19] Dude-X: you will have to convert them to bytestrings
[2013-10-08 12:20:50] jimevans: not only that, but requests.get() probably doesn't take the webdriver cookie object as a valid cookie.
[2013-10-08 12:21:06] Dude-X: sevaseva: thanks for the information, it was most useful.
[2013-10-08 12:21:07] denisesballs: oh ok. not used to having to go in that direction... thought unicode was pretty universal
[2013-10-08 12:21:23] grampajoe, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-08 12:21:42] lukeis: denisesballs: you have another issue, you need to translate the webdriver cookie dict to one that requests is expecting
[2013-10-08 12:21:44] jimevans: i'm no python expert by any means, but i'd be very very surprised if you could just pass in a webdriver cookie object.

[2013-10-08 12:22:03] denisesballs: i gotcha, i'll take that one out
[2013-10-08 12:22:07] Dude-X: i thought that's just a plain dictionary
[2013-10-08 12:22:30] jimevans: Dude-X: it is, but does the requests library take just a plain dictionary? i'd bet not.
[2013-10-08 12:22:31] lukeis: requests wants  { cookie_name: cookie_value }   i believe
[2013-10-08 12:22:58] sevaseva: AutomatedTester: machines that http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/ runs
[2013-10-08 12:23:08] denisesballs: i'm referencing the example:
[2013-10-08 12:23:08] denisesballs: >>> cookies = dict(cookies_are='working')
[2013-10-08 12:23:08] denisesballs: >>> r = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)
[2013-10-08 12:23:08] denisesballs: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/#cookies
[2013-10-08 12:23:09] jimevans: s/plain dictionary/plain dictionary with the same set of name-value pairs as returned by webdriver/
[2013-10-08 12:23:33] AutomatedTester: sevaseva: do it
[2013-10-08 12:23:50] jimevans: denisesballs: that's great, but you'll need to translate the dictionary you're getting back from webdriver into one that requests will understand.
[2013-10-08 12:24:29] jasonN, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-10-08 12:24:42] denisesballs: i know, was just explaining that it takes a dictionary

[2013-10-08 12:25:02] Dude-X: i think it's really a str versus unicode issue
[2013-10-08 12:25:13] denisesballs: which shal i try first... :)
[2013-10-08 12:25:53] jimevans: Dude-X: it's almost assuredly not. even if unicode/non-unicode stuff isn't right, the dictionaries don't have the correct structure.

[2013-10-08 12:31:50] denisesballs: kinda funny what starts with selenium evolves into urlparse, requests, urllib2, httplib, beautifulsoup, json :o
[2013-10-08 12:32:21] lukeis: you could probably eliminate some of those ;)
[2013-10-08 12:32:33] lukeis: requests / urllib2 are redundant
[2013-10-08 12:32:56] lukeis: not sure what you're using in urlparse / httplib (but could be reduced too) :)

[2013-10-08 12:41:20] lukeis: we spoof user agents here in chrome all the time ;)
[2013-10-08 12:41:42] jimevans: sure we do, but we don't need special features of webdriver to do it.

[2013-10-08 12:42:12] lukeis: in general for selenium webdriver, the answer is no, we don't spoof… run on the target platform / version

[2013-10-08 12:42:58] lukeis: chrome has chrome options

[2013-10-08 12:43:25] barancev: options to spoof a user agent?
[2013-10-08 12:43:41] lukeis: i'd have to look up the code to do it
[2013-10-08 12:43:50] lukeis: but yes, it's currently possible
[2013-10-08 12:43:53] lukeis: (we're doing it)
[2013-10-08 12:43:55] barancev: or to spoof window.navigator.platform?
[2013-10-08 12:44:05] lukeis: hmm
[2013-10-08 12:44:25] lukeis: i'd have to double check that, but I would imagine it to be available
[2013-10-08 12:45:23] barancev: user agent spoofing can be easily done with a proxy, that is a browser-neutral solution

[2013-10-08 16:09:03] jlundy: thats for the base
[2013-10-08 16:09:05] jlundy: then to get the message
[2013-10-08 16:09:29] jlundy: raise @selenium.find_element(:css, '.save-cancel.form_controls.error .message').text
[2013-10-08 16:10:14] jlundy: wrong irc
[2013-10-08 16:10:58] timbo1: :P
[2013-10-08 16:14:17] jlundy: still wont work for me anyway.  :-(
[2013-10-08 16:14:17] jlundy: document.querySelectorAll(".save-cancel.form_controls.error")
[2013-10-08 16:14:21] jlundy: works fine in the browser
[2013-10-08 16:14:38] jlundy: but selenium blows up on the find element
[2013-10-08 16:15:51] timbo1: what lang selenium? java?
[2013-10-08 16:15:55] jlundy: ruby
[2013-10-08 16:16:05] timbo1: oh, thats as far as I can go lol
[2013-10-08 16:16:12] jlundy: well its the css selector thats the problem
[2013-10-08 16:16:19] jlundy: find_element is pretty much the same across all of them
[2013-10-08 16:16:22] timbo1: yeah
[2013-10-08 16:16:31] timbo1: there is a method find by css selector
[2013-10-08 16:16:38] timbo1: so if it works on the browser...
[2013-10-08 16:16:57] jlundy: yeah returns the "section"
[2013-10-08 16:17:08] jlundy: no clue why its failing in selenium
[2013-10-08 16:17:49] timbo1: does it blow up or just don't return anything
