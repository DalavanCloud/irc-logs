Firefox console output. do i have ot start selenium server before i run my test?
[2013-04-26 04:53:10] Dude-X_: ha6aha6a, not unless you're using remotewebdriver
[2013-04-26 04:53:22] Dude-X_: probably need to update your selenium jar to the latest
[2013-04-26 04:53:28] Dude-X_: if you're using the latest firefox

[2013-04-26 05:03:22] Dude-X_: the latest version is 2.32.0
[2013-04-26 05:03:28] Dude-X_: 2.5.0 is from like 2011
[2013-04-26 05:04:09] ha6aha6a: ok i saw that one. though it was strange that version 2.32.0 is newer than 2.5.0. but i will download
[2013-04-26 05:04:45] Dude-X_: this is not math.
[2013-04-26 05:04:52] Dude-X_: these aren't decimal points

[2013-04-26 07:18:01] andrewSC: hey guys, I'm trying to do some IE testing with grid and it seems that if I launch my test with selenium i get different behavior than if i launch ie normally (i.e. being physically at the computer and clicking the icon)

[2013-04-26 07:18:54] andrewSC: what's even more weird is if i clear my cache/cookies then log into this website with a user/pass that's expected to fail, i get the proper message. when selenium does it, there is no message even though it's the same user
[2013-04-26 07:20:09] KaibutsuX: selenium does it as a new user I believe, so you're probably getting some stuff from your local profile

[2013-04-26 12:32:49] llaskin: sadly you can try AutoIt
[2013-04-26 12:32:52] llaskin: but there really is no solution
[2013-04-26 12:33:03] jimevans: brockfredin: if your application uses standard HTML file upload handling (i.e., <input type='file'>), then don't bother.
[2013-04-26 12:33:12] jimevans: the drivers will handle it for you.
[2013-04-26 12:33:50] jimevans: if your application developers have insisted on reinventing the wheel, or using something non-standard like a Flash component, you'll need an external solution.
