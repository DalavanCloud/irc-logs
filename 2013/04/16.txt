[2013-04-16 07:31:20] garndt: jimevans: as of 2.28, when I try to interact with an element outside of the viewport, I get ElementNotVisibleException.  I have tried 2.28 through 2.32 and all have the same issue.  2.27 and before are fine.  I have tried using action chains to move to that element first (which it does), but then click() raises that exception.  I have been trying off and on
[2013-04-16 07:31:21] garndt: for weeks to come up with a test case and html file for it but so far can only reproduce in our app in multiple spots.

[2013-04-16 07:33:52] jimevans: garndt: i just picked up a patch for the IE driver, available in 2.32.0.1 (or later, which would include 2.32.3.0) for this area. maybe give that a try? i don't really expect that it will solve your issue, but you've nothing to lose. :)

[2013-04-16 07:41:39] agentile: hello, hoping for some help. Trying to get PHPUnit with Selenium going. I run java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.32.0.jar ... start running my tests. When selenium tries to "Preparing Firefox profile..." it dies saying java.lang.RuntimeException: Timed out waiting for profile to be created! ... I thought maybe I need to create a specific firefox profile for selenium. so i do ... firefox -CreateProfile selenium ... but that gives me Error: cannot open
[2013-04-16 07:41:41] agentile: display: :22 ... because ya, I'm on a EC2 instance and don't have X setup or anything.
[2013-04-16 07:42:48] agentile: not sure if I am completely missing something from the docs
[2013-04-16 07:48:21] garndt: jimevans: The message I'm receiving is specific to the element not being scrolled into the viewport, so I'm not sure why that's being thrown when I can visually see that it is (action chains ensured this).  Oh well.  I'll stay on 2.27 and continue to try to find out the silly reason for this.

[2013-04-16 07:51:20] jimevans: garndt: i know your app is pretty complicated, so cutting down to a simple html page is hard. unfortunately, i don't have any other solution for you. there are lots of tests in the webdriver test bed that click on elements not in the viewport to make sure proper scrolling happens, including in a variety of frame/iframe configurations, so it's got to be something unique to your app. (i know you already know all this)
[2013-04-16 07:53:19] garndt: Yes, I do know, which is why I haven't brought this up much and haven't opened an issue. Just grumbling.

[2013-04-16 08:06:20] jimevans: garndt: i'm not surprised. sendKeys doesn't have to calculate exact coordinates on the screen to which to send mouse messages.
[2013-04-16 08:07:00] garndt: ah ok
[2013-04-16 08:07:53] garndt: I need to dive more into this.  There are other areas of the app where things are outside of the viewport and click() scrolls it into view and clicks it appropriately.  Fun times.

[2013-04-16 09:07:48] lukeis: source isn't loading too… but at least there's GH for that
[2013-04-16 09:09:49] ArSn: Is there any common pattern to test pageobjects themselves?
[2013-04-16 09:10:04] ArSn: e.g. writing a test per Page Object that checks whether it works properly or not?
[2013-04-16 09:10:31] davehunt: usually the tests themselves are a good indication, but I have written tests for a page object model before
[2013-04-16 09:10:46] davehunt: but that was because the page object model was shared between projects
[2013-04-16 09:10:53] *lukeis is not a huge fan of attempting to test the tests'
[2013-04-16 09:11:09] ArSn: well we often have the case that acceptance tests "fail" because the pageobject doesn't do what it is expected to do
[2013-04-16 09:11:12] davehunt: who watches the watchers?
[2013-04-16 09:11:13] ArSn: e.g. because the markup changed

[2013-04-16 09:11:24] ArSn: therefore the idea was to check those first, then run the acceptance tests
[2013-04-16 09:11:57] ArSn: is that a ... bad idea?
[2013-04-16 09:11:57] ArSn: :D
[2013-04-16 09:12:09] lukeis: sounds like creating a test suite to just exercise the concise items of your site ;)
[2013-04-16 09:12:11] davehunt: ArSn: it's more work for you :)
[2013-04-16 09:12:22] ArSn: well thats my employers problem
[2013-04-16 09:12:23] ArSn: lol
[2013-04-16 09:12:25] RossPatterson: ArSn: We don't regulary test our PageObjects, we just expect that when the code being tested changes, the tests that use them will break.
[2013-04-16 09:12:56] RossPatterson: We do, of course, test them when we're building them at first, or making significant changes.  But that's manual testing.
[2013-04-16 09:12:59] ArSn: well yes they do, but its fairly hard to distinguish between a real feature break or only that the pageobject issn up to date
[2013-04-16 09:13:03] ArSn: thats the point
[2013-04-16 09:13:18] ArSn: *isn't
[2013-04-16 09:13:29] ArSn: yeah well we doo that too already, but seems it doens't really suffice
[2013-04-16 09:13:38] RossPatterson: If you regard tests as production code, it doesn't matter which is wrong.  We do.

[2013-04-16 11:32:53] jimevans: you're using Selenium IDE?
[2013-04-16 11:33:09] needhelp7777: im using selenium the firfox addon
[2013-04-16 11:33:19] jimevans: yeah, that's Selenium IDE.
[2013-04-16 11:33:32] needhelp7777: ok yes ide correct thanks for clarifying for me ;-)
[2013-04-16 11:33:40] jimevans: (i almost typed Selenium IED, which is actually a more accurate term)
[2013-04-16 11:33:49] needhelp7777: loool ;-)
[2013-04-16 11:34:18] jimevans: unfortunately, i stay deliberately ignorant of IDE, so i'm not going to be much help.
[2013-04-16 11:34:30] needhelp7777: for some reson the "description" field will not record
[2013-04-16 11:35:18] jimevans: yeah, it's a rich text editor using an iframe.
[2013-04-16 11:35:25] needhelp7777: any help is appreciated
[2013-04-16 11:35:39] needhelp7777: so is there anyway to be able to automate it?

[2013-04-16 11:36:19] jimevans: i'm sure there is, but i don't know whether or not it's possible with a record-playback tool (like selenium IDE)
[2013-04-16 11:36:22] needhelp7777: i did not notice that
[2013-04-16 11:36:39] needhelp7777: thanks for clarifying
[2013-04-16 11:36:59] needhelp7777: what is the reason selenium cannot record the rich text editor using iframe?
[2013-04-16 11:37:23] jimevans: i don't know. i deliberately stay far away from knowing much about selenium IDE.
[2013-04-16 11:37:33] needhelp7777: looooooooooool
[2013-04-16 11:38:01] jimevans: i have a very, very, *very* strong bias against record-playback tools.
[2013-04-16 11:38:12] jimevans: so i'm really the wrong person you want to ask. :)
[2013-04-16 11:38:47] *lukeis enjoys utilizing that bias to argue in my favor'
[2013-04-16 11:38:57] needhelp7777: found this
[2013-04-16 11:38:59] needhelp7777: As selenium IDE will not record any text entering in to text area. we need to add manually
[2013-04-16 11:39:05] barancev: the reason is very simple: wysiwyg means that what you see is _not_ how it works :)
[2013-04-16 11:39:07] ShawnM: we use tiny mce in an iframe but don't use the ide to handle it
[2013-04-16 11:39:11] needhelp7777: selenium.selectFrame("//table/tbody/tr[2]/td/iframe"); //frame location
[2013-04-16 11:39:28] lukeis: that's RC
[2013-04-16 11:39:28] barancev: it involves manipulations with hidden fields and lotsof javascript
[2013-04-16 11:39:30] lukeis: not IDE
[2013-04-16 11:39:33] *jimevans has found that people who are dead-set on using record-playback can rarely be dissuaded from doing so.'
[2013-04-16 11:39:59] needhelp7777: thanks for sharing lukeis
[2013-04-16 11:40:05] needhelp7777: that very intersting
[2013-04-16 11:40:19] lukeis: i for one, welcome my record-playback overloads…. wait? wrong meme?
[2013-04-16 11:40:34] jimevans: "overloads"? LOL
[2013-04-16 11:40:35] lukeis: needhelp7777: if you can, start using Selenium WebDriver
[2013-04-16 11:40:41] lukeis: hehe
[2013-04-16 11:40:52] lukeis: overlords, freudian slip?

[2013-04-16 11:41:05] jimevans: as The Wife is fond of asking, "what would Freud say?"
[2013-04-16 11:41:34] lukeis: needhelp7777: yes, you need to 'code' your automation
[2013-04-16 11:41:38] jimevans: needhelp7777: yes. and that's why i really shied away from mentioning it. i get the impression that's not something you're interested in at all.
[2013-04-16 11:41:58] needhelp7777: ill try if i really must ;-)

[2013-04-16 11:45:54] RossPatterson: needhelp7777: What type of rich-text-editor is it?  As ShawnM has already said, Tiny-MCE can be automated, and I know CuteEditor can be as well.

[2013-04-16 11:48:13] lukeis: you are showing Java code using Selenium RC
[2013-04-16 11:48:19] needhelp7777: so, for frame position, search using xpather, and use typeKeys.
[2013-04-16 11:48:27] needhelp7777: thats what the blog mentioned
[2013-04-16 11:48:52] lukeis: Selenium RC is old technology now ;)   use Selenium WebDriver if you are starting out new
[2013-04-16 11:49:01] RossPatterson: Yeah, that's what it says, but it doesn't mean it will work with YOUR rich-text-editor.  There are lots of them and they're each different.
[2013-04-16 11:49:15] RossPatterson: lukeis: WebDriver doesn't make RTEs any easier.  Nice try :-)
[2013-04-16 11:49:26] lukeis: it does in some respect
[2013-04-16 11:49:28] lukeis: with native events
[2013-04-16 11:49:47] RossPatterson: Hmm ... that's worth a think or two.
[2013-04-16 11:50:18] needhelp7777: ok so should i try using tinymce or cute editor perhaps
[2013-04-16 11:50:46] RossPatterson: Oh, I don't know about THAT.  Aren't you kind of stuck with the editor that the developer has on the page?
[2013-04-16 11:50:52] RossPatterson: Or are you BUILDING the page?
[2013-04-16 11:50:56] needhelp7777: does cuteeditor work together with selnium ide or not?
[2013-04-16 11:51:12] barancev: WebDriver and tinymce: https://gist.github.com/barancev/5398513
[2013-04-16 11:51:43] lukeis: <3 barancev
[2013-04-16 11:51:55] barancev: WebDriver and ckeditor: https://gist.github.com/barancev/5398517
[2013-04-16 11:51:57] needhelp7777: yes the site is called kijiji.ca and im trying to automate the field Desciption which does not work in selenium ide because it uses a rich text editor in iframe
[2013-04-16 11:52:34] jimevans: needhelp7777: it's important to know *which* rich text editor it's using too.
[2013-04-16 11:52:50] jimevans: and the only way you'd know that is to examine the source of the page in question.
[2013-04-16 11:52:56] needhelp7777: any way to find out by viewing the source code of the page?
[2013-04-16 11:53:14] needhelp7777: ok let me try to find it
[2013-04-16 11:53:28] barancev: with webdriver you (usually) don't need to conjure on hidden elements
[2013-04-16 11:53:43] RossPatterson: Selenium RC and TinyMCE: https://gist.github.com/RossPatterson/5398534#file-gistfile1-txt
[2013-04-16 11:53:44] needhelp7777: what should i type in the search field for which rich text editor its using?
[2013-04-16 11:54:05] RossPatterson: Because we're not trying to test TinyMCE itself, but rather the system it's built into.
[2013-04-16 11:54:40] barancev: when you do RC, the same is true for any input field
[2013-04-16 11:55:06] barancev: because setting value is not "typing into the field"
[2013-04-16 11:55:46] RossPatterson: Agreed
[2013-04-16 11:55:50] needhelp7777: here is a copy of the source code
[2013-04-16 11:55:51] needhelp7777: var rteDescriptionObj = new RichTextEdit
[2013-04-16 11:56:20] needhelp7777: jQuery.data($("#hdnDescription")[0],"descRTE",rteDescriptionObj);
[2013-04-16 11:56:55] needhelp7777: <script type="text/javascript">
[2013-04-16 11:57:43] barancev: and the last sample (in groovy) -- filling tinymce with some text and making the text bold: https://gist.github.com/barancev/5398574
[2013-04-16 11:57:56] RossPatterson: barancev: Nice.
[2013-04-16 11:58:29] barancev: very straightforward, right?
[2013-04-16 11:58:38] RossPatterson: Yup.  Very nice.
[2013-04-16 11:58:39] barancev: unlike RC or (omg) SeIDE
[2013-04-16 11:58:58] jimevans: RossPatterson goes WebDriver? :)
[2013-04-16 11:59:52] RossPatterson: Some day :-)
[2013-04-16 12:00:26] RossPatterson: I still think the API is bass-ackwards, and the "cast x to y" stuff is for the birds, but I can read the words on the wall :-)
[2013-04-16 12:00:43] *RossPatterson mumbles mene, mene, something, something'
[2013-04-16 12:01:35] barancev: which API?
[2013-04-16 12:02:11] RossPatterson: WebDriver.* and WebElement.* vs. DefaultSelenium.*
[2013-04-16 12:02:26] barancev: use watir-webdriver :)))
[2013-04-16 12:02:44] RossPatterson: Oh, great, now barancev is shilling for jarib :-)
[2013-04-16 12:03:01] *RossPatterson doesn't have any Ruby slippers :-)'
[2013-04-16 12:03:33] jimevans: or, you could do what i wanted to do and create watin-webdriver. :)
[2013-04-16 12:03:45] barancev: well, then, try groovy
[2013-04-16 12:03:55] barancev: no types, no casts
[2013-04-16 12:03:55] jimevans: that was my plan, then i got sucked down into IE-land, and that's all she wrote.
[2013-04-16 12:04:20] RossPatterson: Naw, C# here at work because that's what we code everything in, and Python for anything else, because it's comfortable.
[2013-04-16 12:04:56] barancev: someone should implement watip
[2013-04-16 12:05:28] barancev: someone who cares about APIs
[2013-04-16 12:05:50] RossPatterson: Point taken :-)
[2013-04-16 12:06:46] jimevans: the only reason the .net bindings are complete is because i wanted watin to use them for cross-browser testing.

Ideally given that it take a while for firefox to startup I would prefer to start the firefox instance up (ie initialise the driver) one and pass that to the test suite. Had anybody done this before? or is this a bad idea?
