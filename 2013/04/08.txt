[12:42:26] Quadlex: andreastt: Can't just use have browser specific prefixes?  It works so elegantly for CSS

[12:42:51] andreastt: Different implementations do have lots of extensions.

[12:43:17] andreastt: Quadlex: One such example is profiles, which is supported by operadriver, chromedriver, and firefoxdriver.
[12:43:19] Quadlex: (NB: I was absolutely not serious)
[12:43:35] andreastt: Well, in all seriousness, vendor prefixes is something that's going to go into the spec.
[12:44:03] AutomatedTester: andreastt: only for things that the specific vendor needs
[12:44:21] Quadlex: Fair enough :P
[12:44:29] AutomatedTester: andreastt: not like CSS where people added them while they argued implementation
[12:44:40] andreastt: AutomatedTester: That would be so much more fun.
[12:44:42] andreastt: Why didn't we do that?
[12:44:57] AutomatedTester: andreastt: Mozilla no longer does prefixes on things as a rule
[12:45:22] AutomatedTester: it gets hidden behind a pref if its not ready by branching to a new channel
[12:45:51] andreastt: Opera 14/Chrome/Chromium/Yandex will also drop prefixes completely.
[12:46:08] AutomatedTester: yay...
[12:46:36] *AutomatedTester still sticks by his thoughts that webkit has done more damage to the web than Microsoft ever did
[12:46:57] andreastt: I wonder how you reached that conclusion.
[12:47:27] AutomatedTester: the amount of "built only for webkit" sites out there as point 1
[12:47:42] AutomatedTester: the reluctance of webkit to remove prefixes
[12:47:49] AutomatedTester: as point 2
[12:48:00] andreastt: The two are connected to a large degree, I think.
[12:48:24] AutomatedTester: they are but they are separate items
[12:48:33] andreastt: Yes, the first might entail more.
[12:48:45] AutomatedTester: since added 1 line as a fall back is not hard work
[12:48:46] stan has joined #selenium
[12:48:49] sth has left #selenium
[12:48:57] AutomatedTester: and tbh shows extremely lazy web developers
[12:49:09] andreastt: Yes, fundamentally it's bad craftmanship.
[12:49:22] andreastt: But it's our fault putting the developers in such a situation.
[12:49:47] AutomatedTester: so Mozilla, and now Chromium, is fixing that
[12:50:01] AutomatedTester: but webkit arent removing all prefixes
[12:50:17] Quadlex: I am all for everyone accepting fault as long as it leads to shame-driven correction
[12:50:20] AutomatedTester: so we have put a plaster on huge gash
[12:50:34] Quadlex: But there are plenty of developers who seem to enjoy cutting off people using "bad" browsers
[12:50:51] andreastt: Quadlex: Opera 12's approach to adopt -webkit-* was progressive there and then, as it meant more sites would work in Opera.
[12:51:09] AutomatedTester: Quadlex: but 9/10 web developers assume bad browsers are ones they dont use
[12:51:21] Quadlex: "Please go download a real browser" Oh really?  Geeze, it appears I've been trying to social media my locations aware b2b on a bagel!  Silly me.
[12:51:38] Quadlex: AutomatedTester: That's exactly why I find it obnoxious.
[12:51:57] andreastt: AutomatedTester: "In short: we won't use vendor prefixes for new features. Instead, we’ll expose a single setting (in about:flags) to enable experimental DOM/CSS features for you to see what's coming, play around, and provide feedback, much as we do today with the “Experimental WebKit Features” flag. Only when we're ready to see these features ship to stable will they be enabled by default in the dev/canary channels."
[12:52:12] andreastt: The exception is legacy prefixes that won't be carried on.
[12:52:22] AutomatedTester: a good example is Google suggesting that a browser like IE10 isnt modern in Google Docs and GMail
[12:52:26] Quadlex: I have seen quite a bit of ... value judgements made when product developers decide what browsers to support
[12:52:54] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Indeed.  Their market dominance allows them to dictate such things.
[12:53:02] Hz0 has joined #selenium
[12:53:07] Quadlex: AutomatedTester: ...really?  Huh.  That's... that's something
[12:53:07] andreastt: It's extremely rude of Google to do something like that IMO.
[12:53:15] Quadlex: Rude of any developer
[12:53:24] Quadlex: "You've made choices.  Bad choices."
[12:53:53] Quadlex: All the way to the extreme of "Hey, this might work, but we're not going to let you try because your User-Agent isn't on the list"
[12:54:08] AutomatedTester: andreastt: but it kinda goes against Google saying they are working for a more Open Web
[12:54:21] AutomatedTester: their idea of an Open Web is via Chromium based browsers
[12:54:41] tobie has joined #selenium
[12:54:55] Phil37: so theyre evil now
[12:54:58] AutomatedTester: Quadlex: yea, Google <3 checking UA on their sites instead of sniffing
[12:55:18] Quadlex: AutomatedTester: It's a good way there's no way to pretend to be another agent.
[12:55:43] AutomatedTester: Quadlex: you can with Firefox and an addon
[12:55:57] AutomatedTester: or proxying
[12:56:35] Quadlex: AutomatedTester: Sorry, that was meant to be funny >.>  I mean, Opera has UA spoofing built in and has for years
[12:56:36] andreastt: AutomatedTester: I think from the side of the developers it's meant as a way of forcing vendors into supporting more modern standards, but it really doesn't work like that when in reality the only browsers supporting the features are browsers using the -webkit-* implementation or aliases that to their own implementations.
[12:56:57] andreastt: Quadlex: Yes.  A surprising number of sites work if you spoof Opera as Firefox or Chrome.
[12:57:19] Quadlex: andreastt: It's kind of depressing really
[12:57:30] Quadlex: They've cut off this chunk of people for... no reason
[12:58:08] andreastt: We had a team of three people working fulltime towards Google, Facebook and other major websites to have them support our browser.
[12:58:30] andreastt: But a big part of having Google and Facebook supporting smaller, non-mainstream browsers is actually the recognition of WebDriver.
[12:59:03] andreastt: It makes it substantially more easy for Google (and others) to develop against browsers their developers don't use day to day.

[13:04:04] AutomatedTester: Quadlex: that sounds a worthy fix

[13:24:12] vila: hi all !
[13:25:14] vila: I have some questions about launching firefox with the python bindings in the current implementation, who should I ask and is the right place for that ?
[13:26:35] vila: py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/firefox_binary defines FirefoxBinary. There, the _start_from_profile_path method calls Popen twice
[13:27:01] vila: My understanding is that this will spawn firefox twice which is a bit surprising, what's the rationale ?
[13:27:49] farlan has joined #selenium
[13:30:16] AutomatedTester: vila: that is by design
[13:30:43] AutomatedTester: vila: we generate a profile for firefox but we only fill in what we need
[13:31:13] AutomatedTester: the first popen will get firefox to complete the creation of the profile for us and remove any cruft
[13:31:21] AutomatedTester: the 2nd launch is the important one
[13:31:49] vila: AutomatedTester: wow, I would never have guessed...
[13:32:36] AutomatedTester: vila: the --silent will kill the browser once its started
[13:33:09] vila: AutomatedTester: next question: I have a rather unusual use case where the system under test will call firefox itself so I want to disable MOZ_NO_REMOTE=1
[13:33:53] AutomatedTester: MOZ_NO_REMOTE prevents us from killing other firefox instances
[13:34:08] vila: AutomatedTester: so http://paste.ubuntu.com/5689298/ will be enough as it will allow me to subclass FirefoXBinary and just disable the env var
[13:34:32] vila: AutomatedTester: I perfectly understand why it's implemented this way for all use cases I can think of except the one above ;)
[13:34:53] AutomatedTester: yea that should work
[13:35:11] vila: AutomatedTester: and I'm cetainly not asking to change the default behavior ;)
[13:36:00] gdennis has joined #selenium
[13:36:00] vila: AutomatedTester: what's the best way to propose this change ? (And may be another one to migrate MOZ_NO_REMOTE to --no-remote as the former has been deprecated circa ff 1.5 )
[13:36:41] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[13:36:50] AutomatedTester: huh
[13:36:58] AutomatedTester: you dont want to propose a change, but you do
[13:37:47] amitev2 has joined #selenium
[13:39:18] vila: AutomatedTester: oh, sorry, that was unclear, I don't want to propose a change in the actual behavior, only in the implementation to allow subclassing for those who need it
[13:40:05] liberus has joined #selenium
[13:40:14] nicegraham__ has joined #selenium
[13:40:16] vila: AutomatedTester: those subclassing can then change the behavior under their control
[13:40:39] AutomatedTester: and you cant subclass currently?
[13:41:06] vila: AutomatedTester: yeah, I could, but I would need to override _start_from_profile and duplicate most of its content
[13:41:13] AutomatedTester: or are you wanting to remove the env variables
[13:41:24] AutomatedTester: and then force selenium to use a subclass?
[13:41:41] Janusz1 has joined #selenium
[13:41:58] vila: AutomatedTester: selenium uses the browser class/instance you provide it right ?
[13:42:08] AutomatedTester: if you provide it
[13:42:14] AutomatedTester: otherwise it uses defaults
[13:42:24] vila: AutomatedTester: yup, I would provide the subclass indeed
[13:42:28] AutomatedTester: so you would need to create a parent class
[13:42:44] vila: daughter class you mean ?
[13:42:49] AutomatedTester: no parent
[13:43:01] AutomatedTester: because people might be using the FirefoxBinary class already
[13:43:16] vila: AutomatedTester: yes, I don't want to change that
[13:43:17] AutomatedTester: so we can't impact their code already
[13:43:33] AutomatedTester: vila: ok I dont understand what you are proposing
[13:43:39] AutomatedTester: send a patch and I will review
[13:43:45] vila: AutomatedTester: where and how ?
[13:43:52] AutomatedTester: github PR
[13:44:25] AutomatedTester: or google code and upload a patch to an issue
[13:44:58] AutomatedTester: I am just struggling to understand what you mean
[13:46:02] vila: AutomatedTester: I want to tweak the existing FifefoxBinary to make it easier to subclass so *I* can stop using MOZ_NO_REMOTE when *I* start firefox
[13:46:32] AutomatedTester: vila: yes but if you make any changes to the class it will impact all our users
[13:46:50] AutomatedTester: so if you are not making any changes to FirefoxBinary then I am not sure what you mean
[13:46:50] vila: AutomatedTester: the paste above does not change the existing behavior
[13:47:17] vila: AutomatedTester: I'm moving the env var settings from _start_from_profile_path to __init__
[13:47:57] AutomatedTester: ahhh I see now
[13:48:01] hugs has joined #selenium
[13:48:04] vila: AutomatedTester: so I can more easily subclass rather than duplicating _start_from_profile_path in the subclass (which will break if selenium change it, especially since it's private)

[15:38:17] barancev: driver.manage().logs().get("browser")
[15:38:24] barancev: Firefox only atm
[15:40:04] *p_l is forced to work with IE
[15:40:09] p_l: and IE7 at that
[15:40:20] barancev: someone should implement this feature for IE :)
[15:40:42] Revery: barancev: ty
[15:41:13] Revery: so which is it, provide support for more browsers or not support it, seems to have some disagreement
[15:41:34] p_l: barancev: IE's console object is native code and not exported, I think, to COM automation
[15:41:37] p_l: at least so I heard
[15:41:39] zeljkof has joined #selenium
[15:41:41] Revery: my most immediate concern is chrome, but yea
[15:41:57] barancev: for FF we redirect logs to a file, and read the file content
[15:42:31] barancev: and driver.manage().logs().get("browser") returns this file content
[15:42:49] barancev: Revery: disagreement among whom?
[15:43:15] Revery: AutomatedTester: "Revery: webdriver isnt going to support reading that"
[15:44:13] AutomatedTester: barancev: what logs is that?
[15:44:36] AutomatedTester: we have a mechanism for getting what webdriver logs
[15:44:48] barancev: AutomatedTester: the same log you can see on the Error Console (may be not all messages, I'm not sure, but most of them)
[15:45:12] barancev: driver.manage().logs().get("webdriver") returns driver logs
[15:45:27] barancev: Revery: it's not a disagreement, it's "underspecification"
[15:45:30] Revery: hehe
[15:45:48] barancev: there is an interface method driver.manage().logs().get(<logtype>)
[15:46:09] barancev: but which log types can be obtained is not specified and browser-specific
[15:46:11] Revery: Well I'm assuming for any browser that you can write an extension to parse the browser's console log, we'd have the ability to bundle that as part of that browser's webdriver
[15:46:32] Revery: yea the logs are browser-specific
[15:46:40] davehunt: AutomatedTester: have you had any time to look into focusmanager.testmode? If not, I'm keen to help where I can, but I'm not sure how the original issue manifested itself. I could commit and watch CI? :)
[15:46:42] AutomatedTester: Revery: unfortunately it doesnt work that way
[15:46:47] Revery: but even parsing for errors is valuable for assertions
[15:47:04] Revery: oh :-(
[15:47:36] AutomatedTester: Revery: for the next version of FirefoxDriver, if its not in Firefox its not available
[15:47:42] AutomatedTester: davehunt: I havent had a chance
[15:48:26] markalanevans has joined #selenium
[15:48:30] AutomatedTester: davehunt: add the pref and then run tests with native events and see what happens
[15:49:31] barancev: I'm not sure there is a "browser log" for IE at all
[15:49:37] davehunt: AutomatedTester: I don't have much in the way of a test system at the moment, especially not on Linux
[15:50:16] Revery: yea the log events only work in a limited fashion when the dev tools are open in IE i think
[15:50:19] liberus has joined #selenium
[15:55:19] Revery: for chrome there might be a really ghetto way…enabling logging for chrome itself also logs entries for the console.log object. you could filter those results
[15:55:25] Revery: but that seems messy and error-prone
[15:55:39] Revery: not to mention probably slow since you're turning on logging for the whole browser
[15:56:30] AutomatedTester: Revery: saucelabs have a mechanism for getting the details from the web inspector
[15:56:35] AutomatedTester: not sure if the OSSed it
[15:58:32] Revery: I'm guessing not

[18:05:17] cgp_: (or whatever) -- I want to be able to also return *my* kind of WebElement -- so I can add my own functionality to WebElement (in some cases I'm just thinking about providing aliases for things like checkboxes, but I know there is some functionality I want to provide as well
[18:06:17] jarib: cgp_: you could write your own implementation of your WebDriver interface that wraps a real driver
[18:06:29] jarib: s/your WebDriver/the WebDriver/
[18:06:45] Phasze: jimevans: I want to ensure the cursor is over the window.  We have custom right click functionality in our product and if I try and right click in IE8 with the mouse off the screen then some of the right click menu is also off the screen and it throws this error, only in IE8 mind you. OpenQA.Selenium.ElementNotVisibleException : The point at which the driver is attempting to click on the 
[18:06:45] Phasze: element was not scrolled into the viewport. 
[18:08:40] jimevans: Phasze: what happens if you set the requireWindowFocus capability to true?
[18:09:00] cgoldberg has joined #selenium
[18:09:10] jimevans: (it may still not work, but it'll keep you from having to hack the grid sources)
[18:09:16] jarib: cgp_: usually i'd advice against this though, as page objects is a better use of time than making the actual DOM interaction simpler
[18:11:45] Phasze: jimeevans: I haven't tried that but I'll give it a go.  Something like this? capability.SetCapability("requireWindowFocus", true);
[18:12:46] cgp_: Well, that's part of what I was wondering, if I'm using the whole PageObject model
[18:12:58] cgp_: sorry, didn't address that
[18:13:09] girija has joined #selenium
[18:13:30] cgp_: jarib: Well, that's part of what I was wondering, if I'm using the whole PageObject model -- I can only use WebElement as defined by Selenium
[18:13:31] cgp_: is that true?
[18:13:39] Phasze: jimevans: wow it's actually moving the mouse now for clicking and whatnot.  Thanks you much.
[18:13:54] cgp_: jarib: Or, will the pageObject detect anything descended from WebElement?
[18:13:56] cgp_: I imagine not
[18:14:10] cgp_: jarib: (I imagine it's tied down because of constructors)
[18:14:23] jimevans: Phasze: let me clear up what it's actually doing there. it's not moving the physical mouse cursor, but it's shoving mouse events directly into the OS-level mouse event queue.
[18:15:11] Phasze: how is that different from physically moving it if it's being shoved into the mouse event queue?
[18:15:24] jimevans: the downside to this is that the mouse events will be received by whatever window has the system focus. so if another window has focus besides IE, the mouse events will be received by *that* window instead of IE.
[18:16:34] jarib: cgp_: maybe, i don't know. my point is you shouldn't really need custom elements - page objects provide the necessary abstraction 
[18:16:34] jimevans: Phasze: there shouldn't be any difference, but i don't want to perpetuate the myth that we're actually physically moving the mouse pointer like a call to the Windows SetCursorPos api would
[18:16:36] Phasze: that should only be a problem with multiple tests running at the same time on the same node right?
[18:16:51] jimevans: should. emphasis on should.
[18:16:56] Phasze: hehe
[18:17:04] Phasze: thanks
[18:17:19] jarib: cgp_: if you really want to, you can write wrappers like the Select class included in webdriver
[18:17:47] jimevans: there's code in the IE driver that tries to bring the IE window into the foreground, but it may not be 100% reliable, because MSFT doesn't want applications to be able to dictate that they can force themselves to the foreground.
[18:19:03] RossPatterson: It looks like maybe Jenkins doesn't run any of the org.openqa.selenium.server.* tests.  Could that be right?  Or am I misunderstanding the CI setup?

[18:56:03] Kad--: doesn't seem to work with my code

[18:57:07] Kad--: this should work but it doesn't

[18:58:37] Kad--: to check all the entries inside the cookie, and I got nothing
[18:59:01] Kad--: maybe that's because I didn't add the path and secure fields.

[19:22:16] garndt: did you only use name and value, or did you try setting it with path and secure as well?
[19:22:25] Kad--: I tried both
[19:22:28] garndt: ok
[19:22:47] garndt: does get_cookies() just return an empty list?
[19:23:39] Kad--: Is there an issue (maybe ?) with https website ? 
[19:23:47] Kad--: mmh let me check this out
[19:25:15] Kad--: no, I have a cookie in it
[19:25:18] Kad--: the one I set
[19:27:22] Kad--: eg. [{u'domain': u'domain.com', u'name': u'foo', u'value': u'bar', u'expiry': 1901903834, u'path': u'/', u'secure': False}]
[19:27:23] garndt: what happens when you call self.browser.refresh() after setting the cookie?  Does your PHP script dump it out?
[19:27:33] Kad--: i check it
[19:28:12] Kad--: working with the refresh thing !
[19:28:18] Kad--: nice one
[19:28:30] Kad--: it's dumped on the page
[19:29:14] Kad--: silly question, I didn't try the refresh 
[19:29:16] garndt: well because once you set the cookie, the script didn't grab the cookies again.  It was done doing it's thing once 'get' returned
[19:29:34] Kad--: yes i see
[19:29:47] Kad--: so you always "have" to do a get, then to refresh the page ? 
[19:30:21] Kad--: because you can 'craft'  your own requests with your cookies in it at the first GET
[19:30:35] Kad--: (without Selenium)
[19:31:34] Kad--: anyway, thanks a lot :)
[19:34:09] manoj_ has joined #selenium

[21:42:45] santiycr: so, new builds can be made for FF21
[21:43:58] jarib: jimevans: should just be `rake //rb:firefox-test` (at least after everything has been built by java once), but running on a local ruby introduces all sorts of ways it could fail though

[21:52:49] jarib: ok?
[21:53:06] jimevans: the browser never launches, so every test fails.
[21:53:40] jarib: do you have a stack trace for the failure?
[21:54:25] jarib: if instantiating the driver fails, i think it'll try 3-4 times before giving up

[22:59:26] jleyba: lukeis: I pre-emptively bumped the SafariDriver to 2.32.0 back in r27b1e3157569 - it should be good to go for release

[23:00:46] jarib: if you lost the 'r' selbot2 would pick that up

[23:05:34] lukeis: thanks jleyba
[23:07:40] lukeis: :note davehunt sorry, i'm not going to experiment with that preference tweak till we have time to play with it on FF10 or figure out how to exclude it from that version, it'll have to wait till the next release ;)
[23:07:40] selbot2: ok!

[23:42:57] jarib: lukeis: i have a fix for #5237, but may be a little risky right before release (relates to page load logic in the firefox driver) https://gist.github.com/jarib/f5fb1395313d930c1f55

[23:43:47] jarib: barancev: perhaps you have thoughts on this as well ^
[23:44:09] lukeis: jarib: as long as there is a test for it that confirms it passing in CI i'll be ok with it ;)
[23:44:22] jarib: there's no test :)
[23:44:25] lukeis: if tests fall over we can back it out
[23:44:37] lukeis: ahhh, maybe a test would be appropriate then ;)
[23:44:38] jarib: i'm not sure exactly what causes the failure
[23:44:47] lukeis: fun
[23:45:57] jarib: but i should probably spend some time with that. i'll just push it to a branch and update the issue for now
[23:50:32] lukeis: signing off for today… tomorrow should be fun ;) i'm out of meetings at 11am Pacific, release activities will likely begin shortly thereafter (i'm going to work on the change log tonight)
