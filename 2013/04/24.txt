[2013-04-24 06:35:28] KaibutsuX: anyone have any opinion on this? We recently had a problem with our autocompletes selecting the wrong item when using d.send_keys(text), but we made a change to make it do; for x in text: d.send_keys(x) and now it seems to fix our problem. I don't like it because I'm pretty sure that's what webdriver is doing anyway, and I'm thinkning all this does is slow the process down
[2013-04-24 06:36:23] barancev: do you mean selenium is too fast?

[2013-04-24 11:48:46] joeljohnson: We use Jenkins. We connect all our slaves via SSH (Cygwin in the case of windows). This causes us to have a pretty common problem with cygwin: the sshd process doesn't have a desktop, so browsers don't actually get drawn. This is fine for FF, but IE dies. I was wondering if there was a way to force the browser processes into a different user/desktop? Anyone know?

[2013-04-24 13:11:00] andreastt: asavchuk: Hey, integrated your cookies patch BTW.
[2013-04-24 13:11:00] asavchuk: barancev_mobile: no, this test is for all drivers - about checking of delete cookie is no-op
[2013-04-24 13:11:16] asavchuk: andreastt: thanks
[2013-04-24 13:13:03] nirvdrum: jleyba: I'm just getting a new Mac set up here, so can't readily build the Safari extension yet.  But it looks like most of the webbit timeout issues I was seeing before are resolved.  Is there any reason to time out executeAsyncScript after 100ms still?
[2013-04-24 13:13:49] jleyba: nirvdrum: the SafariDriver doesn't use webbit - it uses netty directly
[2013-04-24 13:13:55] asavchuk: andreastt: have a question - which status of work for fix issue with file upload in operadriver?
[2013-04-24 13:14:03] jleyba: Not sure what you mean by needing to timeout executeAsyncScript
[2013-04-24 13:14:08] nirvdrum: jleyba: Oh.  Is that new?  Or am I just crazy?

[2013-04-24 13:17:16] jleyba: that's how executeAsyncScript has always been implemented for 0-based timeouts
[2013-04-24 13:17:29] jleyba: (not just the safaridriver)
[2013-04-24 13:17:36] asavchuk: barancev_mobile: oh, thanks!
[2013-04-24 13:17:55] nirvdrum: Ahh.  This is the first time I needed it, as I'm playing with a JS implementation of canvas capture for Safari.
[2013-04-24 13:18:26] nirvdrum: Well, sorry to bother you then.  I guess I need to see an explicit upper-bound timeout.

[2013-04-24 13:21:59] asavchuk: nirvdrum: what's status of "adding the proxy code to IEDriver" as you mentioned in last comment?
[2013-04-24 13:22:41] andreastt: asavchuk: I believe file uploads work from Java, perhaps something strange is happening when we do the wire protocol conversion.
[2013-04-24 13:22:48] nirvdrum: I got stuck.
[2013-04-24 13:23:00] andreastt: asavchuk: As for status, I'm not really going to work on that since Presto's going away.
[2013-04-24 13:23:22] nirvdrum: Generally you can set a proxy per IWebBrowser2 (IIRC), but I couldn't coerce that type out of IE.
[2013-04-24 13:23:32] nirvdrum: So I was heading down the path of virtualizing the registry.

[2013-04-24 13:35:53] nirvdrum: asavchuk: So, setting up one proxy for all IE instances is easily doable in C.  But what I really wanted was a proxy per-IE.

[2013-04-24 14:04:57] andreastt: asavchuk: I added support for file fields in OperaDriver about half a year ago or so.
[2013-04-24 14:05:27] andreastt: asavchuk: The problem was that the file field is riddled with security measures, so we had to extend the Scope protocol to interact with it.
[2013-04-24 14:05:41] andreastt: So you might need a fairly recent Opera version.
[2013-04-24 14:06:03] nirvdrum: lukeis: Do you have some time to field some ios-driver questions?
[2013-04-24 14:06:23] lukeis: probably
[2013-04-24 14:06:35] lukeis: i hate oauth right now
[2013-04-24 14:06:43] nirvdrum: Everyone hates OAuth.
[2013-04-24 14:06:49] nirvdrum: It's obtuse.
[2013-04-24 14:07:47] nirvdrum: I was talking to Francois a little while back and he mentioned that ios-driver could both do full canvas screenshots and execute scripts.  I'm finding it can do neither (testing with Safari).  Do I need to do something special to make that work?
[2013-04-24 14:08:49] lukeis: shouldn't driver.execute_script should work
[2013-04-24 14:09:11] lukeis: full canvas on the other hand, i don't know

[2013-04-24 14:09:44] nirvdrum: Yeah.
[2013-04-24 14:09:56] nirvdrum: Known issue?
[2013-04-24 14:10:00] lukeis: either build from source or grab the master ruby gem
[2013-04-24 14:10:05] lukeis: yes
[2013-04-24 14:10:08] nirvdrum: Bah.  Sorry.
[2013-04-24 14:10:23] lukeis: so in both cases it will be fixed in the next release
[2013-04-24 14:10:24] o3u, quitting. (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[2013-04-24 14:10:29] lukeis: of selenium or ios-driver ;)
[2013-04-24 14:10:42] lukeis: or you can grab this beta build… (link in one sec)
[2013-04-24 14:10:59] lukeis: https://code.google.com/p/ios-driver/downloads/list
[2013-04-24 14:11:05] nirvdrum: JS execution?  If it's a client issue, how would it get fixed in ios-driver?
[2013-04-24 14:11:30] lukeis: the responding capabilities to the client library specify "javascriptEnabled" : true
[2013-04-24 14:11:34] lukeis: ruby is strict ;)
[2013-04-24 14:11:56] lukeis: jari updated master to not be so strict in the future
[2013-04-24 14:12:18] lukeis: so either 2.33 selenium, or 0.7 of ios-driver will fix the ruby issue
[2013-04-24 14:13:30] lukeis: (0.6 didn't respond with that capability)
[2013-04-24 14:14:11] nirvdrum: Ahh.  Sweet, thanks.
[2013-04-24 14:14:26] nicegraham: what ever happened to 0.6.1 to resolve that?
[2013-04-24 14:15:30] lukeis: i got lazy? :)
[2013-04-24 14:15:38] lukeis: didn't spend the time to release it
[2013-04-24 14:16:32] nirvdrum: lukeis: Is execute_async_script supported?
[2013-04-24 14:16:38] lukeis: no, i don't think so
[2013-04-24 14:17:06] lukeis: nirvdrum: do you have a use case for it? :)
[2013-04-24 14:17:53] nicegraham: it aint: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/blob/dev/server/src/main/java/org/uiautomation/ios/wkrdp/RemoteIOSWebDriver.java#L375
[2013-04-24 14:18:27] nirvdrum: Earlier I was toying withe supporting full canvas capture in SafariDriver. I was making use of a lib that triggered a callback when the screenshot was ready.  I was going to see if that same code would work with ios-driver.
[2013-04-24 14:18:45] nirvdrum: But with execute_script, I end up returning before the screenshot is ready.
[2013-04-24 14:19:08] nicegraham: that's basically what happens with execute script I think
[2013-04-24 14:19:12] nirvdrum: I could probably add in some hokey setTimeout busy wait thing.
[2013-04-24 14:19:13] lukeis: safari and ios safari are very different beasts
[2013-04-24 14:19:22] nicegraham: we poll for a response
[2013-04-24 14:19:51] gdennis, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-04-24 14:19:53] nirvdrum: nicegraham: But the flow here would be: call function that triggers callback; reach end of file.
[2013-04-24 14:20:11] nirvdrum: Does execute_script actually wait for a return statement?
[2013-04-24 14:20:18] lukeis: iphonedriver got a patch to take full canvas screenshots… but that was pure obj-c… ios-driver uses UIAutomation's screenshot capture
[2013-04-24 14:20:26] nirvdrum: lukeis: I'm sure they are.  But this is just JS and canvas.  I'm hopeful.
[2013-04-24 14:20:28] nicegraham: I *think* so
[2013-04-24 14:20:35] nicegraham: we send the command to instruments
[2013-04-24 14:20:43] nicegraham: and we expect some sort of response
[2013-04-24 14:21:01] lukeis: nirvdrum: you're better off trying to screenshot, scroll, repeat
[2013-04-24 14:21:06] nirvdrum: Interesting.  Well, I could layer in jQuery's deferrable stuff if needed.
[2013-04-24 14:21:22] nirvdrum: lukeis: The problem with that approach is infinite scroll and fixed position elementes.
[2013-04-24 14:21:24] nirvdrum: *elements
[2013-04-24 14:21:30] lukeis: yep ;)
[2013-04-24 14:21:43] lukeis: some sort of limit could be put in place
[2013-04-24 14:21:47] nicegraham: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/blob/dev/server/src/main/java/org/uiautomation/ios/server/command/UIAScriptHandler.java#L37
[2013-04-24 14:22:06] nirvdrum: I've now dealt with that in SnapsIE, a Chrome port of SnapsIE (since obsoleted), a Safari port of SnapsIE (only usable on Windows), and now this Safari Mac JS solution.
[2013-04-24 14:22:07] lukeis: as for fixed elements… how would the user ever see the page in a different state? :)
[2013-04-24 14:22:22] lukeis: fun fun...
[2013-04-24 14:22:32] nirvdrum: I guess for a device that makes sense.
[2013-04-24 14:22:42] nirvdrum: In a desktop browser the answer is by using a bigger monitor.
[2013-04-24 14:23:19] nirvdrum: lukeis: But even then, the screenshot coming from ios-driver has all the Safari chrome, so stitching them together isn't as easy as lining them up top to bottom.

[2013-04-24 14:34:19] nicegraham: it's to do with granularity obviously - just not sure where to set it

[2013-04-24 14:35:24] lukeis: then you'll see the console.log messages
[2013-04-24 14:38:27] nirvdrum: lukeis: Sorry for the bevy of questions, but does ios-driver do anything to interfere with that? I seed the simulator in the Safari Develop menu, but the site is grayed out.

[2013-04-24 14:56:58] nirvdrum: nicegraham: Yeah.  Let me gist it up.
[2013-04-24 14:57:23] nicegraham: cool, I'll add a web handler in the morning so and see if it works :)

[2013-04-24 15:02:36] coreygriggs: lukeis: hmm i'm still getting a status of 0, this time with one ./adb device, but the emulator itself looks like it's running
[2013-04-24 15:03:48] lukeis: the status is just that, a status… doesn't really have any meaning
[2013-04-24 15:04:04] lukeis: it's just there so a Selenium grid can ping the device to know it is alive
[2013-04-24 15:04:28] lukeis: this works right?  driver = webdriver.Remote("http://localhost:8080/wd/hub", {})
[2013-04-24 15:05:11] coreygriggs: yeah that works
[2013-04-24 15:05:56] lukeis: cool, then you're good to go?
[2013-04-24 15:06:42] coreygriggs: well that works, the problem is that i can't run a test without getting httplib.BadStatusLine: ' '
[2013-04-24 15:06:56] lukeis: when do you get that?

[2013-04-24 15:08:39] lukeis: might want to try out the new chromedriver: https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/wiki/ChromeDriver2forAndroid
[2013-04-24 15:10:40] coreygriggs: lukeis: ok thanks for the help! that should at least give me a start. i will want to be able to test on the browser android tablets like to call 'Internet' :-P later

[2013-04-24 15:15:38] lukeis: holy cow that's a lotta JS
[2013-04-24 15:15:54] lukeis: 2854 lines injecting? ;)
[2013-04-24 15:16:46] lukeis: i get the same wow at seeing people send something like jQuery across the wire to execute_script ;)
