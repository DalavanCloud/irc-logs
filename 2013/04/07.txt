[21:13:01] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: are you passing in arguments to execute_async_script?
[21:13:10] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: your example above doesnt have any
[21:20:38] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, No, should I?
[21:21:09] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, I loaded a page that includes my library and a script containing the test functions
[21:21:49] AutomatedTester: yes otherwise its essentially running (test_connect(arguments[arguments.length-1]))(undefined, undefined)
[21:23:31] bikeshedder: So what should I pass as arguments? I just want to call my test_connect function which is global. I just realized that "window.test_connect" returns undefined.
[21:25:08] AutomatedTester: what ever arguments you are expecting arguments[arguments.length-1] to fulfil  
[21:25:31] AutomatedTester: remember arguments is a reserved word in javascript
[21:26:14] AutomatedTester: the function looks at what arguments have been passed in and replaces accordingly
[21:26:24] AutomatedTester: the JIT does that
[21:26:37] bikeshedder: I don't need any arguments in my test_connect method
[21:27:01] bikeshedder: the main problem is that "test_connect" is undefined
[21:27:17] bikeshedder: when checking in the console of the browser window I can call test_connect just fine
[21:27:34] bikeshedder: but I'm unable to call the function from selenium
[21:29:31] AutomatedTester: could it be a race condition?
[21:29:45] AutomatedTester: could you be trying to execute it before its been added to the window object

[21:31:55] amitev has joined #selenium
[21:35:31] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, I tried moving the script tag everywhere... now it's in the head and should be fully loaded before the load event is triggered
[21:37:43] AutomatedTester: and its definitely attached to the window object when you manually call it?

[21:42:04] AutomatedTester: is test_connection definitely attached to the window object
[21:44:46] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, I load a file called "selenium.js" which contains the function definition via <script src="selenium.js"></script> and it's loaded just fine. I can even see the browser loading the file and receiving a 200
[21:45:50] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: what happens when you call typeof window.test_connection in web console
[21:49:53] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, it returns "function" as expected.
[21:50:27] AutomatedTester: hmm dont know what could be the issue then
[21:50:42] AutomatedTester: is your code public
[21:50:44] AutomatedTester: or the site
[21:52:18] bikeshedder: It's F/OSS software but I haven't pushed the broken test code, yet

[22:18:50] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, https://bitbucket.org/terreon/mushroom and the test code can be found under mushroom/tests/selenium.{py,js,html}
[22:21:44] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: can you change https://bitbucket.org/terreon/mushroom/src/dd4691ec58405db940b4f0eeba8758ef9e11afd5/mushroom/tests/selenium.js?at=master#cl-7 to 
[22:22:07] AutomatedTester: window.test_connect = function (cb) {
[22:22:11] AutomatedTester: and then try again
[22:22:40] AutomatedTester: or simply call test_connect() without window
[22:24:06] bikeshedder: I do cal it without window
[22:24:34] bikeshedder: and window.test_connect = function(cb) { ...} didn't change anything
[22:25:55] bikeshedder: When I print the exception execute_async_script gives me I get: TimeoutException: Message: '' 
[22:27:04] bikeshedder: oh my... "set_script_timeout(1)" and it just works.
[22:28:19] AutomatedTester: ahh
[22:29:00] bikeshedder: Now I only need to get rid of the overly verbose logging http://codepad.org/Df4SZs8x
[22:30:40] AutomatedTester: just log your app
[22:31:25] bikeshedder: It is part of a unittest and python unittest sets up the loggers. I just haven't found a way how to configure the logger for selenium
[22:40:44] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, any ideas why selenium is giving me this output? When calling webdriver.Firefox() from the console outside of the unittest I don't get the output.
[22:41:19] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: i guess whatever you are using is reading stdout
[22:41:32] AutomatedTester: or at least whatever is being piped
[22:41:56] AutomatedTester: 2% battery so might disappear in a min
[22:42:33] bikeshedder: I just wonder why I only get the output inside the unittest. Running the code outside of python unittest does not result in that nonsense output.
[22:42:37] bikeshedder: Thanks anyways. :)
[22:43:01] AutomatedTester: i have never seen that output with unittest
