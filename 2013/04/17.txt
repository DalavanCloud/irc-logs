[2013-04-17 01:43:15] barancev: I was thinking about better reuse -- e.g InternetExplorerDriver() constructor can just delegate to this(DesiredCapabilities.internetExplorer()) etc.

[2013-04-17 04:35:45] jimevans: I had a POC completed for mouse events.
[2013-04-17 04:36:59] jimevans: Essentially, I subbed the EventUtils implementation for the synthetic mouse implementation because that was easier.

[2013-04-17 04:38:05] AutomatedTester: barancev: I am antepidian so perfectly acceptable to use
[2013-04-17 04:38:58] jimevans: It was a copy-paste implementation, and not one that was clean enough to commit. I just wanted to see what would be involved.
[2013-04-17 04:40:28] jimevans: I had a few issues with coordinate miscalculations which I didn't bother to iron out.
[2013-04-17 04:40:44] jimevans: Why do you ask?
[2013-04-17 04:41:17] barancev: because it's a chance to get rid of gecko SDK

[2013-04-17 04:47:47] jimevans: Which surprised me, because simonstewart seemed skeptical about the quality of the implementation of the interface in legacy versions of Firefox.
[2013-04-17 04:50:01] AutomatedTester: jimevans: simonstewart wont listen on this matter because there isnt "native" in the method name
[2013-04-17 04:50:08] AutomatedTester: even though the actual events are native
[2013-04-17 04:50:18] jimevans: Anyway, I was successful enough to encourage someone else to follow up with a real implementation.
[2013-04-17 04:50:42] AutomatedTester: jimevans: click in marionette already uses this methodology

[2013-04-17 04:58:00] jimevans: If I were going to implement it for realsies, I'd change the Firefox driver's synthetic events to use it, then start a discussion about migrating the existing "native" implementation with this one.
[2013-04-17 05:00:10] AutomatedTester: thats the right approach
[2013-04-17 05:00:32] mreedell-work, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-04-17 05:04:47] barancev: right, it's "synthetic" in essence
[2013-04-17 05:04:52] jimevans: barancev: I'll see what I can do, but I don't have time to correct the coordinate calculation issue. The drag and drop tests in particular fail, not because we don't drag and drop, but because the drop happens in the wrong place.
[2013-04-17 05:04:59] barancev: but if it works do we need "native" at all?
[2013-04-17 05:05:37] AutomatedTester: barancev: we shouldnt
[2013-04-17 05:05:53] AutomatedTester: is there any reason why we dont ignore .idea in our tree?
[2013-04-17 05:08:15] jimevans: There's definite upside to removing the C++ code from the Firefox driver.
[2013-04-17 05:08:31] AutomatedTester: not requiring the gecko SDK is an upside
[2013-04-17 05:08:52] AutomatedTester: and surprised the Googlers arent all over this like a rash to save their test infrastructure some cycles

[2013-04-17 05:18:55] transactis: Im using it with phpunit aswell btw
[2013-04-17 05:19:04] AutomatedTester: transactis: all browsers understand submit()
[2013-04-17 05:19:40] aweiteka, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-04-17 05:20:05] transactis: Okay, i will submit() but i guess it won't work as when I manually click the <input submit> in the browser, nothing happens
[2013-04-17 05:20:20] AutomatedTester: transactis: are there any errors in the dev tools?
[2013-04-17 05:20:47] transactis: Can't remember, and can't check right now, waiting for code update and database changes
[2013-04-17 05:22:14] AutomatedTester: running tests bbiam
[2013-04-17 05:25:41] jimevans: transactis: You could check your IE settings. Those are what AutomatedTester and I were asking about when you joined the channel. Zoom level. Protected mode settings.
[2013-04-17 05:26:29] transactis: Yeah I did see that posted on stack overflow, about protected mode
[2013-04-17 05:26:47] transactis: But I'm waiting for code update to environment before i can test again
[2013-04-17 05:29:34] transactis: Cheers for help,
[2013-04-17 05:29:47] jimevans: I've seen more people than I care to count bitten by blindly setting the capability to ignore protected mode settings rather than taking the time to actually set protected mode correctly.
[2013-04-17 05:29:47] transactis: I'll report back with updates soon I guess
[2013-04-17 05:30:39] transactis: Considering I havn't used IE for years, only use it at work for this. I know nothing about the settings and what they effect
[2013-04-17 05:31:58] barancev: jimevans: many selenium-based frameworks set "ignore protected mode settings" by default. as if burying the head in the sand helps to avoid a danger

[2013-04-17 07:14:18] AutomatedTester: ok
[2013-04-17 07:14:28] AutomatedTester: is Terminal C far from Terminal B
[2013-04-17 07:14:30] Dude-X_: also the second best bet is going to an official T-Mobile or AT&T store and they will help you get on loine
[2013-04-17 07:14:32] AutomatedTester: I land at B
[2013-04-17 07:14:54] dawagner: AutomatedTester: Whenare you arriving? I have a spare kicking about...

[2013-04-17 07:15:52] dimacus: AutomatedTester: so now that i got the mouse mover working on my machine, i'm wondering, why did you go with setting up a seperate proxy server to sit on top of the grid instead of extending the JsonWire and adding the moveMouse endpoint there?
[2013-04-17 07:15:57] AutomatedTester: dawagner: possible to stick ye olde Royal Mail?
[2013-04-17 07:16:01] dawagner: Definitely :)

[2013-04-17 07:17:18] Dude-X_: NJ Transit Rail is cheap and fast at about 8 bucks
[2013-04-17 07:17:21] Dude-X_: don't take Amtrak
[2013-04-17 07:17:35] Dude-X_: Amtrack is 50 dollars or so
[2013-04-17 07:18:01] dimacus: AutomatedTester: so this way you are no longer attached to a version of of the driver… but isn't there a way to just attach a couple of methods to a class by adding it to the class path?

[2013-04-17 07:19:06] AutomatedTester: dimacus: but the minute you add to the wire protocol you need to do things on the client side
[2013-04-17 07:19:23] AutomatedTester: dimacus: doing it as a grid plugin you dont

[2013-04-17 07:21:34] Dude-X_: but they make an exception for the airport :/
[2013-04-17 07:22:06] Dude-X_: it's 8 dollars to Newark, and 9 to the town west of newark

[2013-04-17 08:12:01] Synck: in the node configuration file for selenium grid I can specify the firefox binary that has to be used
[2013-04-17 08:12:15] nirvdrum: brokenthumbs: Sounds like you need to configure the timeouts on your hub.
[2013-04-17 08:12:53] Synck: but this doesn't work for chrome, tried with ("chromeOptions": {"binary": "C:\\Chrome\\27.0.1453.47\\chrome.exe"})
[2013-04-17 08:13:18] ddary, leaving. (#selenium)
[2013-04-17 08:13:20] nirvdrum: In all likelihood, the hub thought the client timed out and then killed the session on your behalf.  Your client then tried to use it and it no longer existed.

[2013-04-17 08:14:04] nirvdrum: Synck: There's nothing special in grid about that.  You'd need to see how chromedriver allows config.
[2013-04-17 08:14:37] nirvdrum: Or rather, if chromedriver allows you to do it and if so, what the config looks like.
[2013-04-17 08:15:38] Synck: it works when I specify it in the desired_capabilities

[2013-04-17 08:35:53] jimevans: dawagner: so AutomatedTester, barancev, and I were talking this morning about synthetic events in the firefox driver, and why keyboard events use nsIDOMWindowUtils, but mouse events don't.

[2013-04-17 08:39:26] jimevans: interesting. i bring it up, because using that that interface's sendMouseEvent() method is how marionette implements mouse events.
[2013-04-17 08:39:54] jimevans: and if it's good enough for marionette, surely that's an approach we should at least consider, no?

[2013-04-17 08:40:32] AutomatedTester: however, there are other mechanisms for getting trusted events into the browser

[2013-04-17 08:45:08] jimevans: simonstewart didn't have exact recollection last time we discussed it, but had vague "yeah, there were bugs" remembrances too
[2013-04-17 08:45:33] dawagner: So if I grab head, compile it in debug mode, what do I do from there?

[2013-04-17 10:28:26] barancev: kkania: thank you for excellent work, yes, each chromedriver2 release shows better results
[2013-04-17 10:28:46] jimevans: kkania: what are you tracking as the "big issues" left?
[2013-04-17 10:28:51] barancev: but it wants newer chrome versions, that's worrying me too
[2013-04-17 10:29:11] jleyba: barancev: you know chromedriver1 has a limited range of support right?
[2013-04-17 10:29:27] jleyba: cd1 vN only works with chrome vN - (N-2)
[2013-04-17 10:29:56] kkania: it should work with 26, although a few things (file uploads, set alert text, and i think something else) are only in 27

[2013-04-17 10:45:29] jimevans: yes, it is. but it used to be that chromedriver2 wouldn't even launch chrome with the release channel. now it will, so you can at least do partial work with it.

[2013-04-17 11:03:17] dawagner: It will spin up and kill VMs as it needs them, rather than always having a pool running
[2013-04-17 11:03:28] dawagner: I'll publish my jenkins plugin on github when I've cleaned it up a bit
[2013-04-17 11:04:01] dawagner: Right now there's a known issue: If the jenkins server restarts (which it occasionally does), I will need to set a setting before it will spin up any VMs
[2013-04-17 11:04:12] dawagner: I will fix this some time soon (when I learn how jenkins settings should *actually* be done)
[2013-04-17 11:04:31] dawagner: But in the mean time, if you see a job queue, and no executors running, please poke me and I'll work some magic

[2013-04-17 13:20:26] AutomatedTester: touch events are patented by Apple

[2013-04-17 13:22:10] lukeis: what does android do then? or is it that apple / google just won't sue each other over it?
[2013-04-17 13:22:12] AutomatedTester: which is pointer events and... since Microsoft are the good guys again, and doing awesomeness in the touch area, have made it for multiple users and not just fingers
[2013-04-17 13:22:42] bfife: trying to build on x86_64 ubuntu 12.04 and it's being a PITA because of ubuntu's "multiarch"

[2013-04-17 16:19:30] selenium770: and how would I find the child from there?
[2013-04-17 16:20:02] jarib: depends
[2013-04-17 16:20:26] jarib: hard to give specific advice without seeing the HTML in question
[2013-04-17 16:20:45] jarib: you're aware that you can chain find_element calls?
[2013-04-17 16:20:56] selenium770: :O no
[2013-04-17 16:21:01] selenium770: now i do
[2013-04-17 16:21:11] selenium770: that's cool

Ideally given that it take a while for firefox to startup I would prefer to start the firefox instance up (ie initialise the driver) one and pass that to the test suite. Had anybody done this before? or is this a bad idea?

[2013-04-17 18:38:11] rapaul, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-04-17 18:41:58] rapaul: I'd like to take a single node out of a selenium grid to perform maintenance on it. However as new tests are continually being farmed out to it I can't stop it without disruption. Is there a particular command I can send to a node to have it not accept new requests and gracefully exit once it has serviced its current load?
[2013-04-17 18:45:15] rapaul: A better explanation over at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/selenium-users/wean/selenium-users/UsgpWZ6xH0Q/2bZmcR6rJQYJ (excuse the typo in the subject)
[2013-04-17 18:46:49] nirvdrum: rapaul: You could run this command on the node:  http://localhost:4444/selenium-server/driver/?cmd=shutDownSeleniumServer
[2013-04-17 18:46:55] nirvdrum: But I don't know if it's graceful.
[2013-04-17 18:47:24] nirvdrum: Otherwise, no, there's no way to say "continue with this request but stop at that point".  You could probably do it by customizing your grid.
[2013-04-17 18:47:31] rapaul: It kills it immediately, I've tried that already (see the user group post)
[2013-04-17 18:48:18] nirvdrum: You might be able to unregister the node and still have the hub forward the request, but I doubt it.
[2013-04-17 18:49:05] nirvdrum: It sounds like a reasonable thing to add.  But I think most of us running grids have come to accept that things will break and have clients retry anyway.
[2013-04-17 18:49:50] rapaul: You build retying into your test harness if an agent goes away?
[2013-04-17 18:50:07] nirvdrum: Yeah.
[2013-04-17 18:50:17] nirvdrum: I run on EC2.  Amazon can kill a server any time they'd like.
[2013-04-17 18:52:54] rapaul: Sounds like a reasonable approach. But I still think a soft shutdown of a node has merits, even if only to avoid restarting all tests running on that node.
[2013-04-17 18:53:24] nirvdrum: I agree.
[2013-04-17 18:53:37] nirvdrum: Normally you'd handle this with a signal handler, but the JVM complicates that.
[2013-04-17 18:53:38] rapaul: I'll have a play around with JUnit and Cucumber-JVM to see if I can build in retry functionality. Thanks for the insight nirvdrum
[2013-04-17 18:54:04] nirvdrum: So I guess we'd have to layer it at the hub, which probably means improving the console.
[2013-04-17 18:56:24] rapaul: That's what I was thinking, have some way to flag a node as being retired and the scheduler can just skip it from then on.
