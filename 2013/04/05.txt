[13:51:44] barancev|2: what good can we expect from this mode on?
[13:53:23] davehunt: barancev|2: it allows Firefox to process events when it's not in the foreground rather than queue them
[13:53:55] barancev|2: with native events?
[13:54:04] davehunt: should allow for running multiple instances in parallel, which is currently not possible for native events
[13:54:23] barancev|2: cool! can we get rid of no_focus lib on the linux?
[13:54:34] mreedell-work has joined #selenium
[13:54:44] davehunt: barancev|2: I'm not sure, would need testing

[13:55:30] davehunt: The focusmanager.testmode?
[13:55:41] AutomatedTester: barancev|2: jimevans has a WIP from me that removes all need for SDK

[13:56:46] AutomatedTester: barancev|2: its what I have implemented for clicks at least for Marionette
[13:56:50] AutomatedTester: gives us native events

[16:47:13] jlipps: simonstewart:  are you low on time for time zone reasons? i can text jcarr to see if he's awake yet. he'll also be traveling into the office today from the east bay so he might be unreachable for a bit
[16:48:04] simonstewart: My 1:1 with my manager is running late, and there may be a candidate appearing in the office soon. I also arrived late in the office, but am leaving for Berlin early tomorrow, so am all over the place about whether I should be at home or not

[16:52:50] simonstewart: I'm currently doing a talk called "the search for planet x"
[16:52:58] simonstewart: Which is about mobile test automation tools
[16:53:18] simonstewart: Very short version:
[16:53:26] lukeis: i like the title 
[16:53:39] simonstewart: the next generation of mobile test tools will have a webdriver (like?) API
[16:53:45] simonstewart: Because we test hybrid apps
[16:54:01] simonstewart: They'll also be written in the language of the app (probably)
[16:54:14] simonstewart: At work, I've been putting my money where my mouth is for Android
[16:54:38] simonstewart: Pulling together based on the UIAutomation stuff in ICS+
[16:54:49] simonstewart: We'll be Open Sourcing it
[16:54:52] lukeis: UIAutomator*
[16:55:18] simonstewart: :P

[16:55:45] jlipps: very cool.
[16:55:57] simonstewart: Not yet. 
[16:56:00] simonstewart: But I have a plan
[16:56:09] simonstewart: And I think KLP is going to make it pretty easy
[16:56:46] jlipps: is it a "pure" webdriver frontend?
[16:57:02] simonstewart: You can use it that way
[16:57:08] simonstewart: But there are some additions
[16:57:18] simonstewart: (like clicking the hardware buttons, and using a uiselector nicely)
[16:57:43] Swadq has joined #selenium
[16:57:49] jlipps: interesting. but it's still client-server, as opposed to simply a uiautomator library that makes writing uiautomator tests nicer?
[16:58:16] simonstewart: "Nice" is the wrong word
[16:58:23] simonstewart: "Horrific" is the one you're groping for
[16:58:40] jleyba has joined #selenium
[16:58:46] simonstewart: A UIAutomator test needs to be deployed to the device
[16:58:54] simonstewart: and that slows down an already slow process
[16:59:11] simonstewart: The framework I'm working on allows you to iterate quickly off device
[16:59:17] simonstewart: (Unless, of course, you change the AUT)
[16:59:20] jlipps: yep. interesting
[16:59:50] lukeis: don't have any requirement (or plan) for older versions of android i suppose? :)

[17:00:19] simonstewart: lukeis: interface/implementation separation and a robotium-backed impl if necessary
[17:00:20] nhirata has joined #selenium
[17:00:28] simonstewart: But pre ICS is slumping now
[17:00:43] wolcanus has joined #selenium
[17:00:51] simonstewart: And I expect that process to accelerate as cheap (<$50 BOM) devices running ICS become available
[17:00:52] bimmelino has joined #selenium
[17:00:52] jlipps: definitely. are you aware of the state of android on appium? i'd be interested to hear if the approach is radically different.
[17:00:57] lukeis: yeah… i just have a weird tester side in me that says we should automate versions we say we support ;)
[17:01:15] simonstewart: jlipps: I'm not. Spill the beans
[17:01:23] towski has joined #selenium
[17:02:06] jlipps: well we set up a TCP server inside a uiautomator test, then proxy commands back/forth from appium. so it can sit in the device all day long
[17:02:15] simonstewart: Yeah. Very similar
[17:02:20] simonstewart: I have "TheInfiniteTest"
[17:02:25] simonstewart: which handles the commands
[17:02:29] jlipps: yep :-)
[17:02:32] simonstewart: And runs a webbit server
[17:02:37] simonstewart: hosting the remote webdriver stuff
[17:02:52] simonstewart: (which I retweaked quite a lot recently in the selenium tree)
[17:03:04] simonstewart: (so it compiles cleanly and well without additional dependencies)
[17:03:04] jlipps: i see. so in your impl all the heavy lifting is actually inside the infinite test
[17:03:17] simonstewart: We're thinking of side-loading an APK too
[17:03:27] simonstewart: But, yeah, for now the test does the hard work
[17:03:35] jlipps: (for us, we tried to minimize the java element so it's basically a thin wrapper around uiautomator; the webdriver server is in node and shares code with ios)
[17:03:38] simonstewart: But there's only one UIAutomtor test running
[17:03:59] simonstewart: jlipps: avoiding java on android is an odd thing to do
[17:04:03] simonstewart: you know :)
[17:04:10] jlipps: yes i know :-)
[17:04:19] simonstewart: So I'm not. :)
[17:04:28] simonstewart: The client side is super-thin
[17:04:43] simonstewart: And, as with all webdriver implementations, I'm pushing the smarts into the remote end
[17:05:13] jlipps: what i'd really like to talk about is creating extensions to the protocol for mobile behaviors
[17:05:19] jlipps: (sometime)
[17:05:46] simonstewart: http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#extending-the-protocol
[17:05:50] simonstewart: I'm following the spec
[17:05:53] lukeis: simonstewart: for the backing/old versions, robotium is RC style (you like it?) have you taken a look at selendroid? i'm investing a bit of time there
[17:05:55] jlipps: yeah yeah
[17:06:05] simonstewart: lukeis: nope
[17:06:36] simonstewart: jlipps: when we started writing that part of the spec a looong time ago we discussed the process of adding new commands to the base protocol
[17:06:42] jlipps: simonstewart:  the problem i see with extending the spec in this way is that it allows for competing standards that client libs will struggle to support
[17:07:02] simonstewart: jlipps: which is why I'm suggesting collaboration now
[17:07:04] jlipps: so you guys have your thing and we have our thing, but why should we fight over what the client libs bind to?
[17:07:11] bluescreen100 has joined #selenium
[17:07:21] simonstewart: Where is your thing?
[17:07:44] jlipps: http://github.com/appium/appium
[17:08:44] simonstewart: ugh
[17:08:44] jlipps: i've started building some ad-hoc mobile-only behaviors in a backwards-compatible way here: https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/app/controller.js#L728
[17:08:45] simonstewart: js
[17:08:50] jlipps: ;-)
[17:09:11] simonstewart: I've chatted with hugs about the choice of node
[17:09:12] jlipps: hey man i had to write some java to make this stuff work on android! you have your disgust and i have my pain, let's call it even :-)
[17:09:19] simonstewart: :)
[17:09:28] jimevans has joined #selenium
[17:10:20] jcarr: haha
[17:10:38] jlipps: so the approach i took with the extended methods was to bastardize execute_script
[17:10:46] jlipps: but that's obviously only a short-term win
[17:10:54] simonstewart: agreed
[17:11:01] simonstewart: I just add a new command and bind it to a url
[17:11:23] simonstewart: Reading the code now
[17:11:26] jlipps: right. so let's decide what those urls should be!
[17:11:34] ShawnM has joined #selenium
[17:11:36] lukeis: simonstewart: if there's anything I can help with in regards to getting WebView working. I have time to collaborate ;)  since all my apps use a webview in a crucial piece (login) i'm a bit dead in the water without it
[17:11:38] simonstewart: Looks like you're using sockets rather than straight http?
[17:12:05] simonstewart: lukeis: it's been low on the list. The apps I test tend to be native in the key places right now
[17:12:15] jlipps: simonstewart:  we use http for talking to clients (we're a standard webdriver server in that respect), and use sockets to talk to uiautomation/uiautomator
[17:12:33] simonstewart: Ah. My httpd _is_ the test case
[17:13:00] jlipps: yeah. that's sensible if you're just doing java
[17:13:04] jlipps: and just doing android
[17:13:13] simonstewart: ?
[17:13:20] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[17:13:26] simonstewart: It hooks into the selenium server easily
[17:13:32] lukeis: appium kinda does ios too, if you recall ;)
[17:13:43] simonstewart: I'm using ios-driver for ios
[17:13:54] riv has joined #selenium
[17:14:02] jlipps: kinda? hey now… :-)
[17:14:08] lukeis: hehe
[17:14:19] jlipps: we have 95% of the selenium python test suite passing against mobile safari in appium
[17:14:26] lukeis: awesome :)
[17:14:31] simonstewart: nice
[17:14:36] simonstewart: OK.
[17:14:48] simonstewart: I need to go and talk with my manager.
[17:14:49] simonstewart: So
[17:14:56] jcarr: cool info, simon
[17:15:01] lukeis: that's for the chat
[17:15:05] lukeis: thanks*
[17:15:05] jcarr: I've just kind of lurked, but thx for sharing
[17:15:08] simonstewart: jlipps and or jcarr: please ping the selenium-developers list about mobile urls
[17:15:09] jlipps: sounds good. thanks for sharing what you're up to! we'd love to continue to collaborate on getting a solid set of endpoints out there
[17:15:14] simonstewart: np

[17:35:48] andrewSC: right now i'm looking into selenium grid to run my tests in parallel

[17:36:16] andrewSC: had a question and now i can't remember it :(

[17:46:42] andrewSC: because as of right now it just launches an instance of FF and doesn't do anything?
[17:48:07] Dude-X: what are you referring to?
[17:48:19] andrewSC: selenium grid getting started
[17:48:36] Dude-X: there are no ant scripts for grid
[17:48:44] andrewSC: oh?
[17:48:46] Dude-X: you can make your own though
[17:49:04] Dude-X: grid is just the standalone jar you run as a master hub
[17:49:16] andrewSC: ohh I see
[17:49:16] Dude-X: then your nodes will run that same jar as a node
[17:49:34] andrewSC: hmmm
[17:49:40] Dude-X: if someone packaged some stuff as "selenium grid" then that's not officially a selenium hq thing
[17:49:54] andrewSC: yeah no, I was just following http://selenium-grid.seleniumhq.org/run_the_demo.html
[17:50:20] andrewSC: right now my setup is a single instance of selenium then i use cucumber to run my feature
[17:50:39] Dude-X: that website is way out of date.
[17:50:44] andrewSC: tying to figure out how to make the code point to those node*s?
[17:50:47] andrewSC: oh?

[18:01:08] dimacus: andrewSC: so you want to run 10 tests in cucumber in aprallel by using the grid?
[18:01:16] andrewSC: yes?
[18:01:30] andrewSC: well
[18:01:31] dimacus: did you install parallel_tests gem?
[18:01:31] dimacus: https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests
[18:01:37] andrewSC: 10 different scenarios 
[18:01:40] andrewSC: within a feature 
[18:01:47] dimacus: it splits your feature files into seperate threads
[18:01:56] andrewSC: hmmm
[18:02:06] dimacus: and allows you to run them and agrigates all of the tests, etc...
[18:03:10] dawagner has joined #selenium
[18:03:25] dimacus: after you install and get that running, all you have to do is have the code where you request new instace of Firefox or w/e browser you use connect to the grid
[18:03:54] dimacus: also.. if you use the parallel tests, you can run those 10 threads locally… without the grid per se
[18:06:18] dimacus: andrewSC: hope that helps… i'm off to lunch in mean time
[18:06:30] andrewSC: dimacus: no worries, thanks for the info/reading now

[21:10:37] jimevans: KaibutsuX: distractedly, but yes.
[21:11:08] KaibutsuX: any idea why the IEdriver isn't firing key events with nativeEvents disabled on input.send_keys?
[21:13:19] jimevans: KaibutsuX: none whatsoever. native events on is the preferred setting.
[21:13:39] *jimevans is beginning to regret allowing native events = false.
[21:13:53] KaibutsuX: jimevans: I know, but this is a hack to get our app to test minimally
[21:14:00] KaibutsuX: lol
[21:14:28] Dude-X has joined #selenium
[21:14:38] FullTiltProspect has left #selenium
[21:14:45] KaibutsuX: jimevans: is there a preferred way to manually fire events from webdriver? I was thinking execute_script(arguments[0].keydown()) ?
[21:15:28] jimevans: KaibutsuX: you'd have to use javascript, but webdriver intentionally makes it difficult, because you *should* be using native events.
[21:15:47] jimevans: what doesn't work with native events in your app for IE?
[21:16:16] KaibutsuX: everything, most likely due to our terrible html and css
[21:16:49] freynaud has joined #selenium
[21:18:50] jimevans: "everything" is remarkably vague, but if you don't want to go into the details, i understand. with native events off, the IE driver relies on the atoms for keystrokes and mouse events.
[21:20:02] KaibutsuX: jimevans: random things like finding elements correctly, but clicking on a location that's nowhere close to the where element is
[21:20:31] KaibutsuX: I will try again with nativeEvents, but at the time I decided to go without, it was easier to turn off nativeEvents than to try and fix our code
[21:20:36] jimevans: does your app use a lot of frames or iframes?
[21:21:01] KaibutsuX: one frameset, we break out of it for testing and we do use some iframes for covering up activeX controls
