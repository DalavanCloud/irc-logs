[2013-04-30 06:45:38] andreastt: Yes
[2013-04-30 06:45:58] barancev|2: why in JS tests we have this line:
[2013-04-30 06:46:00] barancev|2: var newline = (bot.userAgent.IE_DOC_PRE9 || goog.userAgent.OPERA) ? '\r\n' : '\n';
[2013-04-30 06:46:00] andreastt: I do both kinds.
[2013-04-30 06:46:20] barancev|2: this causes tests to fail
[2013-04-30 06:46:28] andreastt: In Opera?
[2013-04-30 06:46:34] barancev|2: yes
[2013-04-30 06:46:44] barancev|2: when I run tests in opera with \n all is ok
[2013-04-30 06:46:45] andreastt: I didn't write it, so I have no idea TBH.
[2013-04-30 06:47:10] andreastt: I can't think of any good reason why Opera would need \r\n.  Possibly on Windows.
[2013-04-30 06:47:25] barancev|2: I'm on windows
[2013-04-30 06:47:42] barancev|2: and I see the following comment in the test code:
[2013-04-30 06:47:47] andreastt: This might be a relic from the days of Opera 9 or something.
[2013-04-30 06:48:02] barancev|2: Although this looks like a platform dependent change, these newlines are what is seen. In particular, the Opera line ending is consistent cross-platform.

[2013-04-30 12:20:58] runnyspot: if jquery is available on all my pages, can i use it to locate elements? i am having a lot of problems getting ie8 to locate an element using a pretty simple css selector
[2013-04-30 12:21:11] runnyspot: s/can/should/
[2013-04-30 12:21:50] lukeis: s/can/could/   and yes
[2013-04-30 12:22:38] runnyspot: ok, just didn't know if it's considered a best practice
[2013-04-30 12:23:00] lukeis: if you 100% certain the page has and will continue to have jQuery, then sure ;)
[2013-04-30 12:23:10] lukeis: i personally try not to rely on it..
[2013-04-30 12:23:14] lukeis: css usually does the trick
[2013-04-30 12:23:29] lukeis: ie8 does have very limited css selecting abilities
[2013-04-30 12:23:34] lukeis: (blame MS)
[2013-04-30 12:23:41] runnyspot: i don't want to but i can't locate the element. started a manual session in sauce and inspected the DOM and it's definitely there.

[2013-04-30 12:24:19] runnyspot: the selector is really simple: .someclass tbody tr
[2013-04-30 12:24:35] lukeis: why have tbody in there?
[2013-04-30 12:24:44] lukeis: might be causing the issue
[2013-04-30 12:24:49] runnyspot: i didn't write this particular one, but why would it?
[2013-04-30 12:25:00] lukeis: try without ;)

[2013-04-30 12:25:17] runnyspot: alright, one minute
[2013-04-30 12:25:45] lukeis: tbody is typically an auto-generated / inserted dom element depending on browserâ€¦ i don't remember which ones do it off the top of my head
[2013-04-30 12:26:11] runnyspot: ah there's a thead with a tr
[2013-04-30 12:26:16] runnyspot: so it would find that...
[2013-04-30 12:26:43] AutomatedTester: actually... IE8 has the same CSS support as Firefox
[2013-04-30 12:26:57] AutomatedTester: pre-IE8 is different
[2013-04-30 12:27:05] runnyspot: well the test passes in firefox, fails in IE8
[2013-04-30 12:27:23] lukeis: i seem to recall 8 has a few quirks / limitations, wouldn't say the same as FF
[2013-04-30 12:27:52] AutomatedTester: the CSS selectors work, the DOM might parse and spew out different final html
[2013-04-30 12:28:09] runnyspot: when i inspect using firebug lite, i can see the element plain as day
[2013-04-30 12:28:16] runnyspot: on ie8
[2013-04-30 12:29:48] runnyspot: http://imgur.com/Rt2rGhJ
[2013-04-30 12:30:20] runnyspot: selector is: .dataTable tbody tr
