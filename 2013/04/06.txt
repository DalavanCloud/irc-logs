[03:11:46] cgp_- has joined #selenium
[03:12:15] cgp_-: I have a question about ajax, click methods and @WebElement annotations in conjunction with PageFactories
[03:13:10] cgp_-: is it possible that there could be an additional annotation that described the behavior when click occured, such as @Click(method=ajax|page)
[03:14:13] cgp_-: And then have an interface that you could implement that would do the waiting after the click -- we could even have some common sense default ones that might be able to be passed to the driver? (like jQuery, prototype, mootools)
[03:15:58] cgp_-: Actually, having a way to annotations for a waiting strategy for click events in general (wait for a particular element) would be interesting, @Click(method=ajax|page|waitfor,waitforelement=By???)
[03:16:06] cgp_-: I'm not so familiar with the By syntax offhand
[03:16:10] cgp_-: anyway
[03:16:18] cgp_-: I'd be willing to implement this I think
[03:16:25] cgp_-: if it's not a bad idea
