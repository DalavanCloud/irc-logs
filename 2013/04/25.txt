[2013-04-25 08:14:24] RossPatterson: Yeah, I hate the "cast the WebElement to a FrobbableWebElement and call frob() on it, if it doesn't throw an exception, you win" model :-(
[2013-04-25 08:14:37] zeljkof: can anybody help me? http://stackoverflow.com/q/16218435/17469
[2013-04-25 08:15:40] lukeis: RossPatterson: you can always check it is instanceof before trying the cast… (but i agree, i don't really like it)
[2013-04-25 08:16:15] simonstewart: lukeis: exactly
[2013-04-25 08:16:26] simonstewart: The idea is that if something offers the method, that method actually does something
[2013-04-25 08:16:31] RossPatterson: +1
[2013-04-25 08:16:45] simonstewart: I've yet to find a neater way than role-based interfaces for solving this
[2013-04-25 08:16:56] simonstewart: Even if jimevans finds them tacky :)
[2013-04-25 08:17:58] lukeis: maybe it's just my dissatisfaction with strictly typed languages that is my issue… because i find myself doing a similar pattern in java with my interfaces ;)

[2013-04-25 08:18:43] davehunt, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-04-25 08:18:56] jimevans: i'm toying with the idea in .NET of adding .AsFoo properties, or maybe using extension methods to avoid the cast.
[2013-04-25 08:19:29] simonstewart: Extension methods may work, but you'd need to add them at runtime. Can you do that?
[2013-04-25 08:19:50] jimevans: yeah, C# 3.0+ allows extension methods pretty easily.
[2013-04-25 08:19:59] simonstewart: At run time?
[2013-04-25 08:20:10] simonstewart: In ruby, I'd just throw a mixin in and we're done
[2013-04-25 08:21:42] lukeis: zeljkof: try using a chrome option instead?  appears there is one for language "--lang"
[2013-04-25 08:21:59] jimevans: you define them at compile time, but you don't need to change the type directly. define the method with a signature of MethodName(this TypeToExtend), and the framework "just knows" it can call MethodName on objects of type TypeToExtend.
[2013-04-25 08:22:22] jimevans: i might experiment with them in the support assembly.
[2013-04-25 08:22:52] zeljkof: lukeis: thanks, will try
[2013-04-25 08:22:57] jimevans: most of the linq methods are implemented as extension methods.
[2013-04-25 08:23:30] simonstewart: jimevans: the problem there, though (if I grok what you're saying) is that IWebElement will have methods that will throw an exception because they're not applicable
[2013-04-25 08:24:07] jimevans: depends on how they're implemented. :)
[2013-04-25 08:24:11] simonstewart: So someone will see that you can call UploadFile(File) and will call that, even though the webelement isn't a "file" INPUT type
[2013-04-25 08:24:35] simonstewart: So if you're doing that, we might as well just add all the methods to IWebElement directly

[2013-04-25 08:25:58] simonstewart: That's really not leading people to Do The Right Thing, but I guess it's less important in python/ruby since the IDEs don't offer autocomplete in the same way

[2013-04-25 08:26:16] jimevans: i was considering more like adding "GetFileUploader()" or some such, which is only one step removed from doing the cast, and the cast would still work, but the idiom in the .NET languages is to do a null check rather than explicit casting.

[2013-04-25 08:27:31] *simonstewart was pretty sure you can do a cast that resolves to null '
[2013-04-25 08:27:40] jimevans: you can. using the "as" operator
[2013-04-25 08:27:58] simonstewart: Right
[2013-04-25 08:28:10] jimevans: but that's far less well-known-about than explicit c-style casting.
[2013-04-25 08:28:18] simonstewart: So why not just do "element as IUploadable" and compare the result with null?
[2013-04-25 08:28:34] jimevans: that's what i do when i

[2013-04-25 08:34:29] RossPatterson: I'm not a big fan of casts for the same reason that I am a big fan of the RC API.  I love being able to use the IDE's auto-suggestion capabilities.  Nobody (sane) writes C# execpt in Visual Studio.
[2013-04-25 08:34:59] lukeis: nirvdrum: i would expect so ;) (jari did so too, even ran the ruby spec against it for us)
[2013-04-25 08:35:41] RossPatterson: jimevans suggestion of foo.AsBar().date = new Date() is discoverable, if slightly clunky.
[2013-04-25 08:36:05] simonstewart: But not every element will be convertable to "Bar"

[2013-04-25 08:46:37] jimevans: simonstewart: i take your point, and don't necessarily disagree with it. that's one reason i'm considering putting this in the support assembly. that way, you don't get them in your IDE autocomplete unless you explicitly ask for them.
[2013-04-25 08:46:49] jimevans: (or some other assembly)
[2013-04-25 08:46:49] zeljkof: lukeis: the problem is not in setting the profile, the problem is in sending the profile to remote driver
[2013-04-25 08:47:01] jimevans: (or possibly even as a separate add-on project)
[2013-04-25 08:47:02] simonstewart: jimevans: ah. I get you

[2013-04-25 09:08:16] andrewSC: is there a particular reason why I shouldn't run multiple instances of IE8 during testing on the same node?
[2013-04-25 09:08:29] andrewSC: I seem to remember reading something
[2013-04-25 09:09:48] jimevans: andrewSC: used to be you couldn't do it at all with the Java language bindings, which meant that you couldn't do it on a grid node. since 2.25, you have to use IEDriverServer.exe, so it should be possible.
[2013-04-25 09:10:15] andrewSC: ahh I see
[2013-04-25 09:10:21] andrewSC: thanks jimevans
[2013-04-25 09:10:25] jimevans: having said that, some people are complain about session cookie sharing when running multiple instances of IE
[2013-04-25 09:10:33] andrewSC: oh interesting
[2013-04-25 09:10:58] jimevans: so i'd say give it a shot, if it works for you, you can use it. if not, you can find another approach.
[2013-04-25 09:11:39] andrewSC: jimevans: maybe using IE8's "inPrivate" browser (similar concept to incognito in chrome) would solve that?
[2013-04-25 09:12:30] tinygeo, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-04-25 09:12:44] jimevans: it might, if we started IE using the windows CreateProcess API so you could pass the switch on the command line, but we don't. :)
[2013-04-25 09:13:05] jimevans: we start IE using the IELaunchURL api, as documented and recommended by microsoft.
[2013-04-25 09:13:25] andrewSC: aww :(
[2013-04-25 09:13:28] andrewSC: hahaha
[2013-04-25 09:14:05] andrewSC: hmmm
[2013-04-25 09:14:14] jimevans: the problem is that CreateProcess doesn't know about mandatory integrity levels for processes
[2013-04-25 09:14:29] jimevans: which causes all manner of problems for the IE driver.
[2013-04-25 09:14:30] andrewSC: i wonder if there is a way to make ie launch with the flag regardless?
[2013-04-25 09:14:59] jimevans: there were some recent changes in IEDriverServer.exe to allow you to force it to use CreateProcess, but you'll need to modify your registry before it'll work.
[2013-04-25 09:15:24] andrewSC: hmm
[2013-04-25 09:15:43] jimevans: andrewSC: one sec.

[2013-04-25 10:54:54] lukeis: are you using that in your remote webdriver?
[2013-04-25 10:55:03] lukeis: cause pointing a browser to it won't work
[2013-04-25 10:55:21] imphasing: yes, that's what I'm giving my remote webdriver
[2013-04-25 10:55:31] imphasing: if it's http, my browser should be able to hit it as well though
[2013-04-25 10:55:34] imphasing: which I also can't
[2013-04-25 10:56:04] lukeis: what about http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/status  (in your browser)
[2013-04-25 10:56:19] lukeis: the first call the RWD makes is actually to /wd/hub/session  as a POST
[2013-04-25 10:57:00] imphasing: http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/status gives me a jetty 404 as well
[2013-04-25 10:57:08] imphasing: hrm
[2013-04-25 10:57:14] lukeis: how did you start your hub?
[2013-04-25 10:57:35] imphasing: ant launch-hub
[2013-04-25 10:57:42] imphasing: I can run ant run-demo-in-sequence
[2013-04-25 10:57:52] imphasing: now I'm trying to hook my C# webdriver up to my grid
[2013-04-25 10:57:55] lukeis: i have no clue what ant / build.xml that may be
[2013-04-25 10:58:12] imphasing: it stats on localhost:4444
[2013-04-25 10:58:14] lukeis: is that another project somewhere?
[2013-04-25 10:58:25] lukeis: or yours
[2013-04-25 10:58:34] imphasing: yeah, it's standalone, I have a bunch of selenium tests that I want to point at this grid
[2013-04-25 10:58:48] imphasing: since the demos run and fire up browsers, I figured I could connect to it now with a remote webdriver
[2013-04-25 10:58:54] imphasing: but I guess I'm missing some configuration or something
[2013-04-25 10:59:10] rananda, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2013-04-25 10:59:23] imphasing: I assume the demo is connecting to that URL somehow..

[2013-04-25 10:59:52] imphasing: http://selenium-grid.seleniumhq.org/run_the_demo.html
[2013-04-25 10:59:58] lukeis: ahhhhh
[2013-04-25 10:59:59] imphasing: it's packaged with the binaries
[2013-04-25 11:00:00] lukeis: nooooooo
[2013-04-25 11:00:11] lukeis: that's selenium-grid 1.0
[2013-04-25 11:00:15] lukeis: :wiki grid2

[2013-04-25 11:00:18] lukeis: use that ;)
[2013-04-25 11:00:36] lukeis: we really need to take down that site ;)
[2013-04-25 11:00:42] Dude-X: someone should nuke that website from orbit
[2013-04-25 11:04:03] nirvdrum: Well, I did update the site to point at grid2, but no one knows how to deploy to it.
[2013-04-25 11:04:20] nirvdrum: I think there's still value in having the docs available for those running grid 1 for whatever reason.
[2013-04-25 11:04:52] lukeis: noooo ;)
[2013-04-25 11:04:56] lukeis: no value
[2013-04-25 11:05:00] lukeis: none.

[2013-04-25 15:29:39] foist: Can anyone help me get some automation to this Bootstrap formbuilder? http://minikomi.github.io/Bootstrap-Form-Builder/ I've tried a lot of things.
[2013-04-25 15:30:39] Dude-X: that's hard. you'd need action chains and lots of javascript code
[2013-04-25 15:31:20] qaguy, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-04-25 15:31:34] foist: I made some modifications to the Bootstrap form, allowing me to click to add an element to the form, but I can't get a Selenium click to have any affect on it.
[2013-04-25 15:31:54] foist: Would it still be as difficult if it didn't include drag and drop?
[2013-04-25 15:34:48] santiycr, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-04-25 15:35:22] Dude-X: foist: have you tried enabling native events for dragging?
[2013-04-25 15:35:42] foist: Dude-x: no. Googling it.
[2013-04-25 15:35:56] Mezmor: Hi, I'm trying to run a firefox driver, but I'm getting this error when trying to simulate keystrokes: "c.value is undefined"
[2013-04-25 15:36:29] foist: Dude-X: honestly, I'm more curious as to why my click events are not recognized through Selenium. But I'm looking into native events.
[2013-04-25 15:36:34] Mezmor: The line causing the issue is "var c = Utils.getActiveElement(a.session.getDocument());" in FirefoxDriver.prototype.sendKeysToActiveElement
[2013-04-25 15:36:47] Mezmor: Suggestions?
[2013-04-25 15:37:24] Dude-X: foist: it's using javascript to click on things. That works in the general case, but some widgets use more elaborate click handlers
[2013-04-25 15:40:06] foist: 	$("#formbuilder").on("mousedown", "#components .component, #target .dragpoint", function(md) {           and        			$("body").on("mouseup", "#temp", function(mu) {
[2013-04-25 15:40:21] foist: Nothing more elaborate than mousedown and mouseup
[2013-04-25 15:43:56] foist: Dude-X: Why would it be very difficult for the one I linked to if I'm using drag/drop? Can't I just select the element and the target element?
[2013-04-25 15:44:31] Dude-X: you can if you need to drag and dorp
[2013-04-25 15:44:46] Dude-X: but drag and drop means holding down the mouse button
[2013-04-25 15:45:28] Mezmor: No love for my problem :(?

[2013-04-25 15:49:31] Mezmor: the var c = Utils.... etc
[2013-04-25 15:49:37] Mezmor: is in driver_component.js

[2013-04-25 15:50:10] Mezmor: and it's choking
[2013-04-25 15:50:30] Mezmor: I've narrowed it down to the line from driver_component.js, but I'm not really sure about the code in there
[2013-04-25 15:51:25] foist: Dude-X: are native events only disabled on Linux? This suggests so: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/TipsAndTricks#Enabling_features_that_are_disabled_by_default_in_Firefox
[2013-04-25 15:51:55] Dude-X: foist: yes, but it does work on linux. it doesn't work at all on the Mac on firefox.
[2013-04-25 15:52:21] foist: Ah, well I'm on a Mac. Guess that option's out.

[2013-04-25 15:53:40] Dude-X: firefox on Mac requires focus for clicks to get registered natively

[2013-04-25 15:55:17] foist: Any ETA on that? I really would like to use Selenium extensively on my site, but the bread and butter of it centers around that formbuilder. If i can't add components to the form, it loses so much potential for me.

[2013-04-25 16:00:24] Dude-X: but you will need to use Chrome 27 beta, which is not a Stable release yet
[2013-04-25 16:00:43] Dude-X: also i am not sure if Chrome with Chromedriver 2 is 'native' with the Mac.

[2013-04-25 22:46:52] munderwo-work: Hi all. IM running selenium tests from python. I'd like to get a count of how many options I have  in a select box? I've been able to select the select element by id, but I cant seem to work out how to get a count of the child nodes.. Any ideas?

[2013-04-25 23:00:14] rdk1: munderwo-work:  So I know in ruby…. You can take the object of the drop down and call find_element with tag_name there.
[2013-04-25 23:00:16] rdk1: e.g
[2013-04-25 23:00:25] rdk1: drop_down = $driver.find_element(:name,"channel_theme")
[2013-04-25 23:00:25] rdk1: option = drop_down.find_elements(:tag_name,"option")
[2013-04-25 23:00:25] rdk1: option.size
[2013-04-25 23:01:20] munderwo-work: hmm... I can get size in python too, but it gives me what I think is pixel size? ie {'width': 253, 'height': 14}
[2013-04-25 23:02:43] munderwo-work: so in ruby the size attribute would give you the number of options in the dropdown box?
[2013-04-25 23:02:51] rdk1: right
[2013-04-25 23:02:59] rdk1: it returns an array
[2013-04-25 23:03:10] munderwo-work: hmm.. well I dont think it does in python, which is a little broken to me ...
[2013-04-25 23:04:56] munderwo-work: no matter, I think I can work out a count function.
