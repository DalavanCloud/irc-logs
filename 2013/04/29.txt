[2013-04-29 06:47:24] barancev: why did you remove all the browser checks?
[2013-04-29 06:47:35] barancev: does var parent = goog.dom.getParentElement(e) really works in all the browsers?

[2013-04-29 06:50:09] AutomatedTester: there was something, I cant remember where I read it
[2013-04-29 06:50:23] AutomatedTester: but it was a combination of parent and style and the css box and it didnt work
[2013-04-29 06:50:27] barancev: what was wrong with the removed code (that used to do parent = goog.style.getOffsetParent(e) and other interesting things) ? I suspect it was here for purpose

[2013-04-29 10:17:41] jarib: nirvdrum: looks good. i made a small comment on 3b58d23
[2013-04-29 10:17:42] selbot2: 03nirvdrum 2 days ago - Support rotating remote devices in the Ruby bindings. | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=3b58d23 | http://dashboard.ci.seleniumhq.org/#/revision/3b58d23a012e3d53fb6297d893a4bf2e35af8f9c
[2013-04-29 10:18:51] nirvdrum: jarib: I'll have to double check, but I thought Android::Bridge was the local driver.
[2013-04-29 10:19:07] jarib: it inherits from remote
[2013-04-29 10:19:09] nirvdrum: jarib: That's not to say the duplicate code can't be cleaned up.  But that's why I didn't outright remove it.
[2013-04-29 10:19:11] nirvdrum: Ahh.  Okay.
[2013-04-29 10:21:04] nirvdrum: jarib: The only thing I wasn't really sure about is now all remote drivers look like they can rotate.  Naturally they can't.
[2013-04-29 10:21:28] jarib: right
[2013-04-29 10:22:19] jarib: well, the alternative is to leave it to the user to remote_driver.extend(DriverExtensions::Rotatable)
[2013-04-29 10:22:19] nirvdrum: So I wasn't sure if you wanted to do something like dynamically alter the bridge based upon what the driver's reported capabilities are.
[2013-04-29 10:22:37] mreedell-work, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-04-29 10:22:39] jarib: that's also an alternative.
[2013-04-29 10:22:46] nirvdrum: But as I'm sure you've seen, that blows away method caches on all Ruby implementations.
[2013-04-29 10:23:02] nirvdrum: I'm also okay with someone just getting an error if they try to rotate an IE instance.
[2013-04-29 10:23:12] jarib: yeah, i think it's fine
[2013-04-29 10:23:38] nirvdrum: I had another question as to why Capabilities has a merge! method, but not a merge one.
[2013-04-29 10:24:32] jarib: no reason. feel free to add it if you find think it'd be useful

[2013-04-29 10:24:55] nirvdrum: Okay.  Thanks.
[2013-04-29 10:25:32] nirvdrum: And finally, how do you use prerelease versions in a Gemfile?  Should I just vendor the gem if I need the rotate stuff right now?

[2013-04-29 10:30:44] dawagner: It stopped itself because it ran out of disk space, and didn't start itself when I freed up 40G
[2013-04-29 10:30:45] nirvdrum: I guess vendoring is the best option.  I don't think the Selenium source tree can be made to work well with this.

[2013-04-29 11:56:09] lukeis: that should work
[2013-04-29 11:56:42] toks: hmm, gridb
[2013-04-29 11:56:50] lukeis: i didn't feel like manually starting the port forwarding on different emulators every time
[2013-04-29 11:58:10] lukeis: i'll look into the future in handling devices disappearing / reappearing on the hostâ€¦ something that could easily be added
[2013-04-29 11:58:27] lukeis: and by devices i mean things that should up in `adb devices`
[2013-04-29 11:58:55] stackedsax: want us to play with it a bit?

[2013-04-29 12:03:16] toks: yeah
[2013-04-29 12:03:25] toks: lukeis: quick story though
[2013-04-29 12:03:42] toks: if one of our tests crashes the android app, instrumentation dies with it
[2013-04-29 12:03:48] toks: so all other testcases will fail as well
[2013-04-29 12:03:51] toks: note the "-w"
[2013-04-29 12:03:52] lukeis: yep
[2013-04-29 12:04:06] toks: so, that's how I deal with that... on crash... restart instrumentation
[2013-04-29 12:04:14] lukeis: i've added a 'reset' inbetween tests to deal with that
[2013-04-29 12:04:19] toks: ah
[2013-04-29 12:04:33] toks: that's... probably a better idea ^^;

[2013-04-29 12:21:06] dimacus: so, when a test connects to the SE grid, that test gets inline to get the next slot
[2013-04-29 12:21:17] dimacus: but there does not seem to be a timeout for that slot...
[2013-04-29 12:21:52] dimacus: so if there is only 1 node, and my test is in queue but times out before the given a nodeâ€¦ that line item in the queue never leaves :-/

[2013-04-29 16:01:20] RandLAT: Say, in Java, I want to reach an element from within another element, what is the proper xpath for the inner findElement? I'm pretty sure I tried //h2/a, .//h2/a and ..//h2/a and all of them caused an error. Any help appreciated.
