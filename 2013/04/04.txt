[00:13:26] ieamcam: hello
[00:13:54] ieamcam: can anyone please help me understand how I can use selenium-standalone 2.31.0 as a maven dependency ????
[00:14:12] ieamcam: i really just need the groupId, artifactId, and version ... however, i cannot find it
[00:14:24] jarib: nullx: click the <option> element
[00:14:42] nullx: jarib: thanks I'll look into this
[00:15:06] ieamcam: i'm wondering if it's simply not available, and i have to include all of it's dependencies manually? however, I can't determine what its dependencies are

[10:05:38] AutomatedTester: morning all
[10:06:27] AutomatedTester: so... the news from last night was interesting...
[10:06:55] simonstewart:  Which bit? Servo or Blink?
[10:07:02] AutomatedTester: Blink
[10:07:21] AutomatedTester: I wouldnt have issue with Blink if it was a totally new UA
[10:07:45] simonstewart: Surely --- surely! --- people feature sniff these days?
[10:07:56] simonstewart: IE 11 is already polluting that pool in any case
[10:08:19] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: you're previous employer never sniffed and constantly break or send wrong messages
[10:08:35] simonstewart: They compile for UA and version
[10:09:20] AutomatedTester: and, maybe I am cynical, IE11 and Opera are doing what they are doing because new WebKit features which were waiting for upstreaming never got unprefixed
[10:09:43] simonstewart: Sounds a little cynical
[10:10:18] AutomatedTester: but on numerous occasions webkit was the last to unprefix things 
[10:10:24] AutomatedTester: so its not totally unfounded
[10:10:50] simonstewart: We can only hope that Opera's influence will be for the better
[10:10:54] *AutomatedTester wishes Presto would be open sourced...
[10:11:53] jibay has joined #selenium
[10:12:16] simonstewart: Doesn't look like that will happen now
[10:13:45] AutomatedTester: so... since Blink will be a totally revamped WebKit2... is web inspector going to still work
[10:14:19] simonstewart: I'd expect it to. The Chrome Tools team are pretty on the ball
[10:14:38] AutomatedTester: sorry, I mean will it work with all WebKit
[10:14:46] AutomatedTester: have we just lost control of Safari
[10:15:06] simonstewart: I doubt it
[10:15:17] simonstewart: Safari will maintain a wire debug protocol
[10:15:24] simonstewart: There's just no other way to debug on iOS

[10:17:03] AutomatedTester: in other news, rust is available via homebrew now
[10:17:11] AutomatedTester: I might install and play
[10:17:39] simonstewart: What UA will servo use?
[10:17:50] AutomatedTester: I dont know
[10:17:59] AutomatedTester: but I understand it wont show itself as Gecko
[10:18:58] davehunt has joined #selenium
[10:21:07] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: I know we tried the multiprocess stuff before and gave up
[10:21:13] AutomatedTester: it was too hard to retrofit
[10:21:28] simonstewart: But google have already done it
[10:21:53] AutomatedTester: rendering is multiprocess?
[10:22:07] AutomatedTester: or are you talking about tabs?
[10:24:56] simonstewart: Chrome is already multi-process in many places
[10:25:12] simonstewart: They've been working on spannering more of that MP goodness into webkit
[10:29:03] simonstewart: Gosh this is nasty coffee
[10:29:09] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: when are you next in london?
[10:31:35] AutomatedTester: dunno yet
[10:31:44] AutomatedTester: when should we organise it for?
[10:32:05] simonstewart: Things are looking pretty manic this week and next
[10:32:40] AutomatedTester: I dont think I can do the week before GTAC, its The Youngest 8 week jabs
[10:33:02] simonstewart: Lummee.
[10:33:08] simonstewart: How is the youngest?
[10:33:37] AutomatedTester: he is awesome
[10:33:40] AutomatedTester: growing fast
[10:33:53] simonstewart: :)
[10:34:19] AutomatedTester: what are we doing about a F2F with other people this year
[10:34:28] AutomatedTester: since we cant decide on a date for everyone
[10:34:42] simonstewart: We're waiting for andreastt to make a formal response to the mailing list
[10:34:51] simonstewart: Ideally with dates he can make :)
[10:34:52] AutomatedTester: I thought he did
[10:34:56] AutomatedTester: ahh
[10:34:59] simonstewart: Oh! Has he?
[10:35:09] AutomatedTester: no I dont think he did
[10:35:30] simonstewart: Nope. Not yet
[10:35:31] AutomatedTester: I thought you were meaning him replying "I cant do dates because I am cool and going on holiday"
[10:35:54] simonstewart: I'm waiting on arranging the F2F before I book flights and hotels for SeConf
[10:36:04] simonstewart: There's a chance we'll move from Boston to NY (for example)

[11:00:15] barancev: andreastt: what rendering engine is used in opera mobile for android?
[11:02:24] AutomatedTester: barancev: will be Blink
[11:03:19] barancev: I'm asking about the current state
[11:03:46] AutomatedTester: currently I believe its using WebKit, they recently changed
[11:04:03] AutomatedTester: after the announcement I believe they released a new version
[11:04:10] jost has joined #selenium
[11:04:16] simonstewart: For android? Presto, I thought. 
[11:04:19] simonstewart: And soon blink
[11:04:45] AutomatedTester: http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/05/opera-browser-beta-google-play-webkit/
[11:05:01] AutomatedTester: its webkit
[11:05:43] simonstewart: The beta? Sure. But I thought the prod app was still presto
[11:08:30] andreastt: barancev: Currently WebKit.
[11:08:38] andreastt: barancev: Opera Beta for Android, that is.
[11:08:43] simonstewart: interesting. 
[11:08:48] andreastt: barancev: The official Opera for Android uses Presto.
[11:08:56] barancev: thanks!
[11:08:57] andreastt: barancev: But Opera Beta for Android in offroad mode uses Presto.
[11:09:09] andreastt: So new the Opera on Android actually uses two rendering engines.
[11:20:13] *andreastt has a little outrage on Twitter
[11:24:56] Phil37: link
[11:27:14] andreastt: https://twitter.com/tolfsen
[11:28:31] ql6wlld has joined #selenium
[11:34:16] simonstewart: Presto had been neglected?
[11:34:38] andreastt: IMO, yes.
[11:34:51] andreastt: It could've thrived if they had done the right things a few years ago.
[11:35:00] jarib: do we have an open feature request for error capture (i.e. window.onerror) in webdriver?
[11:35:18] andreastt: If they actually allowed developers to finish the features they were working on without distraction; I'm thinking specifically about multi-process support.
[11:35:32] barancev: jarib: #148?
[11:35:33] selbot2: 03 open/new API for checking for JavaScript errors on the page - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=148 [Type-Enhancement Priority-Medium Component-WebDriver]
[11:35:36] simonstewart: oh shit
[11:35:49] simonstewart: I've just run hard into a brick wall of nastiness
[11:35:53] andreastt: If management and our CEO hadn't thought the project of opposing Google and Mozilla with our own renderer wasn't impossible.
[11:36:08] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: ?
[11:36:13] andreastt: If they had put more developers on the project, instead of "right-sizing" the company twice.
[11:36:53] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: I'm reminded that wrapping third party APIs is a Good Thing
[11:36:55] jarib: barancev: thanks. looks like something that should be in the spec
[11:37:09] AutomatedTester: ?
[11:37:35] simonstewart: Also, if the way to solve the problem is to use reflection to munge the internal state of classes that don't belong to you something's gone awry
[11:37:46] simonstewart: Not selenium code. We're safe
[11:37:53] barancev: simonstewart: jarib: and think about adding #711 to the spec
[11:37:54] selbot2: 03jmle...@gmail.com open/accepted Implicit waits should also apply to WebElement manipulation preconditions. - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=711 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Component-WebDriver GettingInvolved]
[11:38:22] sburjan has joined #selenium
[11:38:26] simonstewart: There should be an implicit wait of "visible" for interactions that require visibility
[11:38:33] andreastt: https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2013-April/024388.html
[11:38:33] AutomatedTester: barancev: jarib: I am not sure an API via webdriver should be in our spec
[11:38:33] andreastt: What.
[11:38:39] andreastt: They're removing ninja and gyp.
[11:38:41] andreastt: Are they _insane_?
[11:38:56] AutomatedTester: barancev: jarib: since there are works to standardise toolkits
[11:39:11] barancev: simonstewart: and "enabled" for inputs
[11:39:18] jarib: AutomatedTester: "API via webdriver"? 
[11:39:21] simonstewart: barancev: nope
[11:39:26] simonstewart: users need to check for that
[11:39:41] jarib: "standardise toolkits"?
[11:39:44] simonstewart: the implicits are designed to be exceptionally dumb
[11:39:52] *jarib is slow today
[11:39:56] simonstewart: andreastt: does xcode use gyp or ninja?
[11:40:08] AutomatedTester: 11:46 jarib: barancev: thanks. looks like something that should be in the spec
[11:40:20] AutomatedTester: that was for API to get javascript errors
[11:40:27] jarib: yes
[11:40:49] AutomatedTester: the browser tools w3c group also has a WG for standardising Dev Tools
[11:40:52] andreastt: simonstewart: No, it integrates very poorly.
[11:41:01] andreastt: simonstewart: Actually, the Chromium project recommends you not to use XCode.
[11:41:07] andreastt: simonstewart: $EDITOR is your friend.
[11:41:14] barancev: ok, "implicit" visibility would be enough, with implicit scrolling, if needed
[11:41:14] jarib: AutomatedTester: ah, i get it now
[11:41:19] simonstewart: I believe you're making my point for me
[11:41:39] AutomatedTester: jarib: so I think we should leave it up to them, and hopefully it will be in a separate process
[11:41:45] andreastt: That Apple are Apple-made software fetishists?
[11:41:46] andreastt: Yes.
[11:41:48] AutomatedTester: jarib: well at least in Firefox it will be like that soon
[11:42:00] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: was that barancev's "implicit waits" or the "js api for reporting js errors" comment?
[11:42:14] AutomatedTester: js api for reporting js errors
[11:42:32] simonstewart: A JS API for reporting JS errors?
[11:42:41] simonstewart: Feels like webdriver isn't the right home for that
[11:42:50] AutomatedTester: thats exactly what I just said
[11:42:59] simonstewart: Then we're agreed :)
[11:43:16] AutomatedTester: I said it belongs in the Dev tools WG

[11:45:59] simonstewart: Logs via the webdriver api should be in the spec
[11:46:16] barancev: so what's the proncipal difference?
[11:46:21] barancev: *principal
[11:46:36] barancev: getting logs, getting info about browser-side errors
[11:46:47] simonstewart: The logs of webdriver itself
[11:46:56] simonstewart: rather than "stuff that happened to happen on the page"
[11:46:57] barancev: I mean *browser* logs
[11:47:07] simonstewart: browser-side errors fit in the same category as web timings
[11:48:08] simonstewart: It's up to the implementor to decide if they want to expose browser logs via webdriver's logging mechanism
[11:49:40] jarib: AutomatedTester: do you have a link to the relevant WG? can't find it googling for "w3c dev tools wg"

[17:30:57] SupplyCrawler: I'm just having all kinds of silly stuff go down because urlopen timeouts :<
[17:31:42] lukeis: when does it timeout?
[17:31:58] SupplyCrawler: It differs each time
[17:32:07] lukeis: are you changing the timeout?
[17:32:16] lukeis: you mention using it at the same time
[17:32:17] SupplyCrawler: Uh
[17:32:18] SupplyCrawler: no
[17:32:28] SupplyCrawler: I can change the timeout for urllib? :<
[17:32:43] lukeis: i believe so
[17:32:51] SupplyCrawler: I'll look into it, I guess.
[17:33:28] SupplyCrawler: It either happens on the declaration of the webdriver, the .get for the site in webdriver, or when I try to urlopen a request outside of webdriver
[17:33:37] SupplyCrawler: it's inconsistent, so I'm just kinda weirded out
[17:34:15] lukeis: sounds like a systemic problem of other kinds...

[18:21:17] jimevans: qaguy: what OS?
[18:21:34] qaguy: Mac 10.8.3
[18:22:12] jimevans: lack of native events, maybe?
[18:22:56] qaguy: Native event don't worj for FF or the latest version of FF?
[18:23:15] jimevans: native events don't work on OS X. never have.

[18:23:42] jimevans: should do.
[18:23:50] *qaguy goes to see

[18:28:14] ShawnM: are native events enabled for the driving your creating in the caps?
[18:29:51] qaguy: ShawnM: nope. They are notI just have this to instantiate the driver:  @browser = Selenium::WebDriver.for :chrome
[18:29:52] selbot2: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver | https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list 
[18:30:06] qaguy: but I thought :native_events => true is the default
[18:30:27] jimevans: qaguy: native events being default depends on the browser and OS.
[18:30:30] ShawnM: i think it may very based on browser and platform the default state
[18:30:46] jimevans: native events are true for IE and firefox on windows.
[18:30:52] qaguy: jimevens: Oooooooo
[18:30:55] jimevans: native events are false for firefox on linux

[19:49:01] cozby: I have all the headless jazz setup and working 
[19:49:02] regex_: lukeis: Oh my gawwwwsh.  You's a genius, bro.  
[19:49:07] Xapak: jarib, (iseewhatyoudidthere)
[19:49:21] cozby: however, the exported test cases aren't exactly perfect, they don't setup the display settings 
[19:49:45] cozby: is it possible to just setup the display in a parent script and load the test scripts from within the parent script?
[19:49:54] cozby: (did what I say make any sense?)
[19:49:57] jarib: Xapak: do you have an irc client that supports hipchat emoticons?
[19:50:50] Xapak: No. Colloquy, perhaps, I donâ€™t know. I use irssi. :S
[19:51:05] jarib: heh, ok
[19:51:13] Dude-X: cozby: i've had a shell script that would simply do xvfb (parameters blah) && export DISPLAY=(whatever number you choose) && scriptToStartTests
[19:51:34] Dude-X: alternatively you can use pyvirtualdisplay module and it will do that for you automatically
[19:51:46] cozby: Dude-X: I'm using pyvirtualdisplay now
[19:51:48] Dude-X: without the scripting part
[19:52:01] jarib: cozby: as long as DISPLAY is set correctly when your script launches a browser, it should be good
[19:52:35] cozby: I'm basically running that script, calling display = Display(), display.start(), then iterating through a directory of python scripts (tests) and trying to run them 
[19:52:47] cozby: jarib: really, hmm interesting. OK 
[19:52:52] riv has joined #selenium
[19:52:53] ShawnM: do you plan to have multiple browsers per display and do you plan to have multiple browsers per selenium node?
[19:53:10] cozby: ShawnM: eventually, yes.
[19:53:18] jarib: cozby: does Display() or display.start() set the env var?
[19:53:38] cozby: jarib: hmm 
[19:54:36] cozby: jarib: well, when I run my selenium standalone server I use the following.. DISPLAY=:1 xvfb-run java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.31.0.jar &
[19:54:40] ShawnM: we used a shell script to create unique selenium nodes per concurrent runtime that only use 1 browser at a time that was pretty easy you just specify your display before launching the selenium jar in the script and it works
[19:55:12] cozby: ShawnM: interesting, so you stopped and started the selenium jar every test?
[19:55:35] ShawnM: well say we have 8 run times we then have 8 selenium nodes each attached to its unqiue display
[19:55:39] ShawnM: less than ideal
[19:55:41] ShawnM: but it works
[19:56:01] jarib: cozby: if you're using the remote server, any display manipulation done from the client script is not going to have an effect
[19:56:04] ShawnM: i wish i found a way to explicit pick which display to launch firefox with and only use 1 sel node with high max browser caps
[19:56:17] jarib: s/display manipulation/env var manipulation/
[19:56:44] jarib: i assumed you were using non-remote
[19:56:57] cozby: pardon myself guys, I'm quite green with selenium, I think my core understanding might be a bit shaky 
[19:57:07] cozby: when you refer to "selenium nodes"
[19:57:18] cozby: do you mean machines that run the selenium jar?
[19:57:25] cozby: I
[19:57:27] lukeis: a node is an instance of the selenium jar running
[19:57:36] cozby: lukeis: ah OK 
[19:57:37] lukeis: selenium server*
[19:57:49] cozby: right, so I can spawn off as many nodes as I want 
[19:58:04] cozby: is a node limited to one driver?
[19:58:06] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[19:58:08] lukeis: nope
[19:58:15] cozby: so then why run multiple nodes?
[19:58:27] lukeis: multiple computers with different versions of browsers
[19:58:40] lukeis: computers or VMs 
[19:58:42] lukeis: ;)
[19:58:51] jarib: cozby: i think it'd be better if you explain your setup and ask for advice on that 
[19:58:57] jarib: instead of letting everyone confuse you 
[19:59:02] cozby: fair enough
[19:59:05] jarib: :)
[19:59:14] cozby: so I'm setting up CI for our drupal project
[19:59:15] lukeis: and always listen to jarib ;)
[19:59:32] riv has joined #selenium
[19:59:43] cozby: a build gets commited, our gitlab_ci box gets notified, I launch a collection of selenium tests
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Apr  4 20:00:19 2013]
[20:00:19] jarib: so far so good
[20:00:42] cozby: a bit more detail... when a build is triggered the gitlabCI box pulls the latest commit on a remote box and then I start up my selenium scripts to run on that remote box
[20:00:54] cozby: and by "run" I mean I do a driver.get(my_remote_box_url)
[20:01:25] cozby: the scripts are all running from the gitlabCI box (it also has selenium setup on it) 
[20:01:42] farlan1 has joined #selenium
[20:01:42] cozby: scripts/test/etc
[20:01:43] jarib: so the python scripts run on one machine, the browser is on another
[20:02:30] cozby: jarib: no, the browser is on the machine that launches the scripts
[20:02:43] jarib: so the browser and the scripts run on the same machine?
[20:02:48] cozby: correct
[20:03:01] cozby: and they driver.get() on the remote box 
[20:03:15] cozby: they basically run their tests on the remote box that I got the latest on 
[20:03:18] Xapak: jarib, so, my query looks fine, right? I mean, it should find the element without problem (if it exists, of course, which it does).
[20:03:38] KaibutsuX: if I run a js script that returns an object with a dom element as a property, is there any way to convert that object into a WEBELEMENT?
[20:03:39] cozby: when I say run their tests, I mean they use the URL of the remote box
[20:04:10] llaskin1 has joined #selenium
[20:04:11] jarib: cozby: got it; the test scripts and the browser on box A, the application being tested on box B
[20:04:24] cozby: jarib: precisely 
[20:04:34] cozby: 1) is that a silly approach?
[20:04:40] lukeis: KaibutsuX: if it's a simple object (like an array) then the object will be converted for youâ€¦ complex objects, not so much
[20:04:52] jarib: cozby: that's fine, but you don't need the java server in this case
[20:05:03] cozby: jarib: really?
[20:05:08] cozby: why not?
[20:05:28] jarib: for webdriver, the java server is only really needed when you want the test scripts and the browser on separate machines
[20:05:30] KaibutsuX: lukeis: it looks like mine is not being converted, it's returning this: {u'ELEMENT': u'{16e057cf-2265-4c80-bc69-ce03be9cad66}'}
[20:05:46] lukeis: that looks like a webelement to me :)
[20:05:46] KaibutsuX: I assume that string is webdriver's internal id, is there any way to lookup the element from that id?
[20:05:55] cozby: jarib: ah I see, so thats what remote driving is about
[20:06:01] cozby: ?
[20:06:12] KaibutsuX: lukeis: type() == 'dict'
[20:06:12] farlan has joined #selenium
[20:06:15] KaibutsuX: in python
[20:06:24] lukeis: KaibutsuX: construct a new WebElement :)
[20:06:30] jarib: cozby: right. this is somewhat new in Selenium 2/WebDriver, with Selenium 1/Selenium RC you always needed the server
[20:06:43] jarib: even when running everything on a single machine
[20:06:59] cozby: jarib: I see... (man I was in a fog for a bit)
[20:07:39] jarib: glad to have cleared that up :)
[20:07:48] cozby: jarib: so then how does the remote setup work... would I run the server on box B then?
[20:07:59] cozby: and have my scripts connect to that box?
[20:08:27] cozby: from box A
[20:08:35] jarib: you could. what's the motivation for exploring this?
[20:08:53] lukeis: KaibutsuX:  element = driver.create_web_element(response_dict['ELEMENT'])  
[20:09:14] KaibutsuX: lukeis: thats what I was looking for, thank you!
[20:09:19] cozby: jarib: just trying to make sense of it all, and wondering if my approach is a sound one
[20:09:24] lukeis: KaibutsuX: the conversion should have been done for you thoughâ€¦ 
[20:09:58] KaibutsuX: I'll assume it's due to some crappy js in our code
[20:11:27] jarib: cozby: it's sound if it does the job :)
[20:11:43] cozby: jarib: ha, well... thats TBD ;)
[20:11:50] cozby: its quite slow
[20:12:45] jarib: right, speed may be one motivation for moving the browsers to other boxes
[20:13:08] jarib: but you could also try to parallelize your tests on the box you already have first
[20:13:14] cozby: jarib: in which case I would run the selenium server on the box B (the build box)
[20:13:48] cozby: jarib: mm yes, that was my next step
[20:16:53] BrockF: lukeis: You's a genius, bro.  Why you choose mobile testing?
[20:17:28] lukeis: i'm not sure if that's meant as a complement or an insult? :)
[20:17:42] jarib: lol
[20:17:58] jarib: lukeis: what did you do now?
[20:18:02] BrockF: Total compliment.  I ain't got no insults.  
[20:18:08] lukeis: i don't know what i did ;)
[20:19:53] lukeis: i always go where there's a need i suppose?  mobile is very needy right now in testing ;)
[20:21:56] lukeis: okâ€¦ just had to look back to see regex == BrockFredin now ;)
[20:22:26] BrockFredin: lukeis: You be a gangsta on that mobile shizalllllllawaaa.  Keep it cracking so that CI can build autonomously continually.  Can you automate a phone dialer so that I can dial everyone in my area?  That could be useful ;)  I worked on an SMS system once and sent a bunch of error SMS sends to a bunch of people.   
[20:23:13] lukeis: heh, i help with automating things, what you do with thatâ€¦ well, i believe in karma ;)
[20:31:46] Dude-X: send SMS to a whole bunch of people? you know SMS is not unlimited for many americans!
[20:31:47] lukeis: facebook on the other hand are really doing things in the mobile testing areaâ€¦

[23:00:48] andrewSC: Welp, I'm trying to @driver.find_element(:css, 'a[text="foo"]') and I'm not able to find the element but if I use jQuery I can do $('a:contains("foo")') and get the element in question, I'm running selenium in ruby. Does my syntax look okay or ?
[23:01:21] andrewSC: tl;dr what am i doing wrong with that css selector in selenium?
[23:02:23] andrewSC: is it something silly like I need to use text()="foo"
[23:02:25] andrewSC: ?
[23:02:30] jimevans: there is no css selector that can select an element based on its text content. by "no css selector" i mean none that are supported by any CSS standard
[23:02:38] lukeis: 'a[.="foo"]'
[23:02:50] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[23:02:54] andrewSC: hmm
[23:03:10] lukeis: that's xpath
[23:03:15] lukeis: err
[23:03:17] jimevans: jquery has some bastardizations of CSS (like :contains), but those are not standard. and selenium defers to the browsers' css selector engine.
[23:03:27] andrewSC: ahh I see
[23:03:32] andrewSC: lukeis: did you mean css?
[23:03:35] andrewSC: well
[23:03:39] andrewSC: no we just talked about this...
[23:03:41] lukeis: you want find_element(:xpath, '//a[.="foo"]')
[23:03:56] jimevans: so if you're dead-set on identifying the element via its text content, you'll have to use xpath.
[23:04:00] lukeis: css does not look at text
[23:04:11] andrewSC: interesting
[23:04:36] lukeis: Sizzle has an implementation of :contains, but that is not in any W3C spec
