[2013-04-23 08:28:10] Phil37: as opposed to lines like "[NOT:0000003000][172.16.153.165/- -] [-/- -]unable to add route to UC device:" that we want to store in the output
[2013-04-23 08:28:28] cgoldberg: Phil37, so fix whatever is not logging them
[2013-04-23 08:28:42] Phil37: the checks we have in place atm checks every line, I was thinking of adding the '?' and ':' checks to only be for the last line
[2013-04-23 08:29:12] Phil37: as i think when youre grabbing data the usual final lines are something like  [root@VM199 ~]#

[2013-04-23 13:05:35] andrewSC: hey guys
[2013-04-23 13:06:06] andrewSC: so i'm working on setting up selenium grid and i've got a hub and node with IE running
[2013-04-23 13:06:18] nirvdrum: adamgoucher: SO uses OpenID.  And what did you mention my name for?  Scroll back buffer lost it.
[2013-04-23 13:06:46] nirvdrum: lukeis: You'll be happy to know that I picked up a Mac Mini today to try out ios-driver.  The first Apple product I've owned in over a year.
[2013-04-23 13:06:49] adamgoucher: someone was asking about attaching phantomjs to grid and having issues with the nodes
[2013-04-23 13:07:08] andrewSC: here's the problem though, when i run a feature i point cucumber to the hub and request for ie, great, that works. However, the node with ie tries to hit a url that is only available on my local dev box; the box i originally made the request to the selenium hub on
[2013-04-23 13:07:09] lukeis: nirvdrum: nice! ;) welcome to the club
[2013-04-23 13:07:13] nirvdrum: adamgoucher: Ahh.  I haven't tried that as I think fake browsers are a terrible idea.
[2013-04-23 13:07:38] andrewSC: How does one get the node to make requests to the machine that initialized the test?
[2013-04-23 13:07:44] nirvdrum: lukeis: I was warmly greeted by the Mac App Store app crashing in the middle of performing the initial updates.
[2013-04-23 13:07:56] andrewSC: i've thought of tunneling back but that gets tricky
[2013-04-23 13:08:00] nirvdrum: lukeis: I forgot how Apple products just work.

[2013-04-23 13:08:44] andrewSC: is there a way for the node to make web/http requests to the hub which then makes the request to the machine that executed the cucumber feature?

[2013-04-23 13:08:57] nirvdrum: andrewSC: The node just accesses whatever URL the client sends.  There's no magic involved there.
[2013-04-23 13:09:20] andrewSC: nirvdrum: right, but how do i get the url to point to my local machine without some special tunneling ?
[2013-04-23 13:09:30] andrewSC: does that make sense?
[2013-04-23 13:09:32] fredr, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-04-23 13:09:36] fredr, quitting. (Max SendQ exceeded)
[2013-04-23 13:09:37] lukeis: you need to have the node be able to connect to the host in some way...
[2013-04-23 13:09:55] lukeis: proxy is one way… or get them on the same network is another ;)
[2013-04-23 13:09:59] nirvdrum: andrewSC: It's just TCP.  If you bind to a port on a routable IP, you can pass that to the remote machine.
[2013-04-23 13:10:15] fredr, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-04-23 13:10:22] nirvdrum: Otherwise, as lukeis states, you need to proxy or tunnel.
