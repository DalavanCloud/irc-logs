The xpath is //td[input[@name='price11' and @value='DPD'] and input[@name='price6' and @value='B2C']]/input[@name='price3'] . is there any difference in how firebug evaluates xpath and in how selenium does it?

[2013-04-19 11:10:31] jimevans: asavchuk: it should work for all of them, but i confess i've only tested for IE9 and 10. basically, it should work for any version of IE that uses BS_COMMANDLINK style buttons for the onbeforeunload alert. IE6 (and 7 maybe? i don't remember) uses a standard dialog with standard buttons, and should thus be handled by the other branch.

[2013-04-19 11:37:49] asavchuk: barancev: why it should be done at browser-side drivers? exception at node is thrown at java client which construct json to send it to browser driver, as i understand. or some browser drivers talks to hub directly? if not then i suppose only java client should be changed.

[2013-04-19 12:18:32] nirvdrum: My point is more that IE8 hasn't changed in like 6 years.  The time is already sunk into supporting it.  The ongoing maintenance would be minimal, because feature detection would just disable whatever HTML5 features.

[2013-04-19 12:27:46] jleyba: ^ what he said
[2013-04-19 12:27:47] AutomatedTester: barancev: the code to scroll to an element
[2013-04-19 12:27:58] AutomatedTester: click does a scroll
[2013-04-19 12:28:09] AutomatedTester: we arent using the click atom, we are doing native
[2013-04-19 12:28:12] brokenthumbs, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-04-19 12:28:24] jleyba: there should be code for that already in the bot.dom namespace
[2013-04-19 12:28:33] jleyba: chromedriver uses the atoms to scroll before firing off the native click
[2013-04-19 12:28:41] jleyba: at least I think they're using the atoms for that
[2013-04-19 12:28:42] barancev: yes, there is
[2013-04-19 12:28:47] intchanter-work: nirvdrum: I'd like to think that jQuery dropping support for those versions will help amplify the signal that people should be getting off them ASAP, if not sooner.
[2013-04-19 12:29:02] barancev: but FF uses it partially
[2013-04-19 12:29:03] AutomatedTester: jleyba: there is, I was hoping we could pull out just the scrolling part
[2013-04-19 12:29:26] AutomatedTester: jleyba: after the vanilla js of it
[2013-04-19 12:29:48] jimevans: IE doesn't use the atoms for scrolling. would the atoms correctly work in the cross-domain frames case?
[2013-04-19 12:30:07] nirvdrum: intchanter-work: Aside from the point that I don't think that's their pervue, they're still maintaining the 1.9 line.
[2013-04-19 12:30:08] jleyba: AutomatedTester: bot.dom.getInViewLocation
[2013-04-19 12:30:11] AutomatedTester: jimevans: dont know
[2013-04-19 12:30:14] jleyba: implicitly scrolls the element into view if not already
[2013-04-19 12:30:20] AutomatedTester: jleyba: yea, I have started porting that
[2013-04-19 12:30:58] AutomatedTester: jleyba: unrelated, are you in NYC next week?
[2013-04-19 12:31:14] intchanter-work: nirvdrum: I think it's everyone's purview, and the 1.9 maintenance won't last as long as IE6 has.

[2013-04-19 12:31:49] intchanter-work: Meh, no worries.
[2013-04-19 12:31:55] AutomatedTester: jleyba: fair enough
[2013-04-19 12:31:58] jleyba: I don't understand what you don't like about bot.dom.getInViewLocation (or what you're trying to pull out)
[2013-04-19 12:32:05] barancev: whoever uses IDEA or PyCharm for Python coding? can you share code style settings for Selenium?
[2013-04-19 12:32:16] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I like it, but it uses a lot of closure types
[2013-04-19 12:32:44] AutomatedTester: jleyba: and I cant really put the closure code in the mozilla tree
[2013-04-19 12:32:46] nirvdrum: intchanter-work: I totally disagree.  The job of a web developer is to provide a product for a customer.  The point of the web was to free us from the shackles of system requirements.  Build for what the market demands.
[2013-04-19 12:32:52] AutomatedTester: especially, just for scrolling ;)
[2013-04-19 12:32:57] jleyba: Should compile down pretty compact
[2013-04-19 12:33:07] nirvdrum: intchanter-work: 1.9 wont' be around forever, but they're planning 1.x to match 2.x.
[2013-04-19 12:33:15] jleyba: goog.math.Coordinate is just {x:#, y:#}.  goog.math.Size is {width:#, height;#}
[2013-04-19 12:33:27] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I have started doing that now
[2013-04-19 12:33:49] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I wanted things handed to me on a platter ;)
[2013-04-19 12:34:02] jleyba: I'd rather you just fork the function for mozilla than bloat our implementation
[2013-04-19 12:34:16] jleyba: Lose a lot of implementations by having duplicate definitions
[2013-04-19 12:34:24] jleyba: lose a lot of optimizations*
[2013-04-19 12:34:28] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I am not touch our implementation
[2013-04-19 12:34:31] AutomatedTester: touching even
[2013-04-19 12:34:53] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I have copied the code over and removing the closure parts for vanilla js
[2013-04-19 12:35:05] jleyba: you could try generating bot.dom.getInViewLocation as a fragment with pretty printing
[2013-04-19 12:35:18] AutomatedTester: jimevans: ++
[2013-04-19 12:35:24] intchanter-work: nirvdrum: Sometimes what the market thinks it demands is far more wasteful than it's willing to pay for.  The IE "tax" that I've seen mentioned a few times is a good example of un-hiding those costs.
[2013-04-19 12:35:34] nirvdrum: intchanter-work: But, anyway, philosophical difference.  The jQuery 2.0 argument was made on technical grounds.  And the data doesn't support the claims.
[2013-04-19 12:36:11] intchanter-work: I'm curious, though.  Which version did they use for the size comparison?
[2013-04-19 12:36:18] intchanter-work: Minified?  Full?
[2013-04-19 12:36:49] jimevans: AutomatedTester: indeed. i think this one's a no-brainer.
[2013-04-19 12:36:57] nirvdrum: intchanter-work: The IE tax is offensive.  And having something "work" in IE hardly that hard if you know what you're doing.  Put another way, what's the point of having open specs if you constantly need the latest browser to use it?
[2013-04-19 12:37:18] nirvdrum: intchanter-work: I believe the minified.
[2013-04-19 12:37:43] intchanter-work: Open specs are subverted by poor implementations that never get updated.
[2013-04-19 12:37:58] jleyba: jimevans: what is the cross-domain frames case?
[2013-04-19 12:38:46] nirvdrum: intchanter-work: Sites should be degradable.  That's how the Web was designed.

[2013-04-19 12:42:41] jleyba: jimevans: all location stuff in the atoms is purposefully isolated to the frame it is executed in
[2013-04-19 12:42:42] BrockFredin: The .Text method isn't working to pick up the input text.
[2013-04-19 12:42:51] jleyba: we decided frames were too nasty to try otherwise
[2013-04-19 12:43:00] BrockFredin: jimevans: Hope you ha ve a nice weekend 'bragh.

[2013-04-19 12:43:14] jimevans: BrockFredin: nope. that's because the input box doesn't have "text", it has a "value". you need to use GetAttribute("value")
[2013-04-19 12:43:22] jimevans: instead of .Text
[2013-04-19 12:43:25] intchanter-work: nirvdrum: On the plus side, FF will get silent auto-updating soon.  If IE ever figures out how to do that, things will be /much/ easier.

[2013-04-19 12:44:11] intchanter-work: I just worry that it will require MS admitting that previous architecture decisions were flawed.
[2013-04-19 12:44:14] nirvdrum: intchanter-work: That's hit or miss.  Given the number of times the Chrome updater has just utterly broken on me, I'm not excited about that prospect.
[2013-04-19 12:44:17] jimevans: intchanter-work: IE10 *supposedly* does that.
[2013-04-19 12:44:26] jleyba: jimevans: I'm certain I could break ever WebDriver implementation's click handling with iframes :)
[2013-04-19 12:45:00] jimevans: jleyba: "frames and iframes considered harmful" :)
[2013-04-19 12:45:09] intchanter-work: jimevans: I wish that sounded like providing a path for the IE <10 users.
[2013-04-19 12:45:10] nirvdrum: intchanter-work: But if you're going to have auto-updating browsers constantly using a draft implementation of an unrelease spec, let's just lose the pretense of an "open" web.
[2013-04-19 12:45:12] jleyba: s/harmful/evil/
[2013-04-19 12:45:54] jleyba: nirvdrum: if you waited for implementations to move beyond draft, we wouldn't have any of html5 yet
[2013-04-19 12:46:03] jleyba: the w3c is sloooooow
[2013-04-19 12:46:18] nirvdrum: jleyba: Oh, I agree.  But I think I would get along just fine, too.

[2013-04-19 12:46:37] jimevans: there, i fixed it for you
[2013-04-19 12:47:19] nirvdrum: And I certainly don't need drop shadows so badly that I'm willing to risk a stable browser experience.  When my browser breaks, I have a very shitty day ahead of me.
[2013-04-19 12:47:31] nirvdrum: And with silent updates, I don't even know why it broke.

[2013-04-19 12:54:10] nirvdrum: Boom.
[2013-04-19 12:54:29] jimevans: nirvdrum drops the knowledge on ya!
[2013-04-19 12:54:49] nirvdrum: Any other problems need solving today?  I'm on a roll.
[2013-04-19 12:54:51] lukeis: nirvdrum: i notice a lack of recommendation of a cetain browser
[2013-04-19 12:55:13] nirvdrum: lukeis: It's nice when it works.  That tends to be a pretty large crapshoot.
[2013-04-19 12:55:49] nirvdrum: My latest fun with that browser was it kicked off a GPU process that pegged a full core at 100% doing pretty much nothing.
[2013-04-19 12:55:56] lukeis: the funny thing is the *only* problem i've had with chrome is that sometimes it doesn't load google.com! (yes, only google.com for some reason)
[2013-04-19 12:56:13] nirvdrum: Fortunately, my wife was already pregnant.  Otherwise we might have been trying for a while longer.
[2013-04-19 12:56:34] jimevans: "yo, lukeis, i'm really happy for you. imma let you finish, but IE10 had one of the best browsers of all time! one of the best browsers of all time!"
[2013-04-19 12:57:01] lukeis: ?
[2013-04-19 12:57:02] lukeis: :)
[2013-04-19 12:57:10] jimevans: the kids love it when i try to get all dope and fresh with the lingo.

[2013-04-19 12:57:51] nirvdrum: lukeis: I find it a tad humorous that I now use Firefox on my phone because I rolled backed to Gingerbread and Chrome doesn't work there.
[2013-04-19 12:58:19] lukeis: heh, /me has an iphone

[2013-04-19 14:11:00] jimevans: brockfredin: that's a satellite office. corporate HQ takes up a good deal of office space in a couple of buildings in the financial district in downtown SF.
[2013-04-19 14:11:48] brockfredin: jimevans: Very cool.  I worked in San Mateo for about a year for a small financial transaction company.
[2013-04-19 14:12:19] lukeis: the only reason I think we have that building is so people can see it from the freeway :)
[2013-04-19 14:13:19] brockfredin: lukeis: jimevans The first time I was shipped to SF.  I got off the plane, took the BART to the Milbrae station, and than took a taxi.  One of the first vivid memories was that SalesForce building in my adrenaline pushed travel memories.
[2013-04-19 14:14:53] brockfredin: lukeis: I yelled at the Taxi for the expensive ride.  I was told by my boss the most it would cost was $40.  But it was like $70.

[2013-04-19 14:16:17] intchanter-work: brockfredin: Every time I get into a taxi, I expect to be mugged for at least my net worth.  So far, I haven't been disappointed.

[2013-04-19 14:17:05] brockfredin: intchanter-work: My family owns the yellow taxi business in the capital city where I'm from.  So, I'm used to bullshit.  But not complete utter language barriars.
