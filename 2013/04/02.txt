[11:12:31] selbot2: simonstewart: note from AutomatedTester 4 days ago: why do we build up location of element using offset* calls? Is it because we needed to support firefox 2? 
[11:13:00] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: the original location code was derived from Core, so probably
[11:13:25] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: ok, going to rip it out and do The Right Thingâ„¢
[11:13:36] simonstewart: Without breaking things :)
[11:13:41] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: which gives us nice CSS3 location support
[11:13:53] AutomatedTester: I made the change locally and all tests pass
[11:13:59] simonstewart: If you're modifying the atoms, please check IE6 too
[11:14:22] AutomatedTester: support in IE was there from 4 for what I want to do
[11:14:28] AutomatedTester: so its all good :)
[11:14:36] AutomatedTester: its Firefox that was slow to the game
[11:14:50] simonstewart: Then please make sure there are no further regressions in the IE 6 continuous build :)
[11:15:34] AutomatedTester: ok, will raise marionette bugs, since its ported code and then get cracking

[11:16:37] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: jimevans apparently got native events working via nsIDOMWindowUtils, according to a message he left me
[11:16:50] AutomatedTester: but wanted to chat with him about it first
[11:16:51] simonstewart: Nice. 
[11:16:58] simonstewart: He pinged me on twitter about it too
[11:17:26] AutomatedTester: I got click() doing native on FirefoxOS
[11:17:34] simonstewart: native native?
[11:17:36] AutomatedTester: touch, as to be expected, doesnt work properly
[11:17:50] AutomatedTester: the event queue actions it as though its native
[11:17:52] simonstewart: Of course not
[11:17:58] simonstewart: I had a look at the TouchActions recently
[11:18:04] simonstewart: Cripes, they're hard to use
[11:18:26] AutomatedTester: Malini has first draft of her addition to the spec
[11:18:31] AutomatedTester: I need my red pen and to read it
[11:18:34] simonstewart: Nice. Will be happy to review
[11:18:55] AutomatedTester: but yes, touch is a nightmare
[11:19:14] simonstewart: It is, as you say, a nightmare
[11:19:20] simonstewart: But the TouchActions are just plain hard to use
[11:19:33] simonstewart: I wanted to drag a UI element 100 px to the right
[11:19:40] simonstewart: Turned out to be a real dog to do
[11:19:41] AutomatedTester: Patrick Lauche, ex-Opera dev rel, is currently writing a blog post about how each device/OS works with touch atm
[11:20:05] AutomatedTester: Lauke... I cant remember how to spell surname
[11:20:19] AutomatedTester: he is mates with Bruce Lawson
[11:20:41] simonstewart: Bruce is a top chap
[11:20:59] AutomatedTester: he is... and a very angry man...
[11:21:06] AutomatedTester: makes you look cheerful :)
[11:21:38] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Lauke.
[11:21:50] AutomatedTester: thats him
[11:22:10] andreastt: According to the almighty intranet, his middle name is Herbert.
[11:22:10] AutomatedTester: He is writing it for Robert Nyman so assume its going on Hacks.mozilla.org
[11:22:13] andreastt: Don't tease him (=
[11:22:38] AutomatedTester: andreastt: he is a top chap, chatted to him, via twitter all about touch
[11:22:41] andreastt: He is.
[11:22:42] AutomatedTester: and about ARIA
[11:22:54] AutomatedTester: shame Opera fired him

[11:30:13] simonstewart: It's coming. I've a bunch of conferences coming up and the GTAC talk is one of the decks I need to prepare
[11:30:23] simonstewart: The decks are similar, but each conference gets a difference focus
[11:31:08] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: the one in london is that only for Facebook developers
[11:31:16] AutomatedTester: or open for general public?

[12:46:56] simonstewart: Why are we not expecting the alert for IE6?

[12:47:12] simonstewart: and then handling it properly

[12:50:37] simonstewart: We should think about organising one again
[12:50:41] davehunt: simonstewart: the last one was in November iirc, and you weren't able to attend
[12:51:09] simonstewart: According to that chart, IE6 usage in China has slimped from ~25% to ~5% in about a year
[12:51:15] simonstewart: davehunt: I know
[12:51:17] simonstewart: I get busy
[12:51:26] davehunt: I tend to do them every six months or so
[12:51:30] simonstewart: China was place propping up global IE6 usage
[12:52:37] simonstewart: StatsCounter doesn't even register IE6 as a top 12 browser in the same time period in the uk

[12:59:22] simonstewart: I'm also looking at facebook's own metrics
[12:59:48] AutomatedTester: the GET requests are very skewed thanks to Chromes future caching

[13:26:47] *dawagner wonders why china has stopped using ie6
[13:26:54] simonstewart: I wondered that too
[13:26:58] simonstewart: I have a theory
[13:27:06] simonstewart: Or two theories
[13:27:25] simonstewart: 1) Too many sites started looking like ass in IE6, so they're switching en masse
[13:27:55] simonstewart: 2) Sites within China often use toolkits as a skeleton and build from there. One of those toolkits has switched to chromeframe
[13:29:59] barancev: 3) pirates spread win7 more than winxp :)
[13:30:15] simonstewart: maybe, though win7 usage doesn't appear to show the same uptick
[13:30:24] simonstewart: And it phones home a lot more than XP
[13:30:30] simonstewart: (which is why XP is popular with pirates)
[13:30:53] barancev: yes, and the size of the distribution package
[13:30:55] simonstewart: (and because an XP image couldn't be updated without verifying it, IE6 tended to be the browser that was used on pirate xp)
[13:31:24] p_l: simonstewart: I think the real reason why XP is more popular with pirates is that the dumbasses who insist on using XP because they don't understand much have to grab XP from torrents
[13:31:50] p_l: majority of legal XP deployments came either from volume licensing, or from OEM installs
[13:32:04] p_l: same with Vista and 7
[13:32:45] p_l: meanwhile people were on the bandwagon of "XP good, Vista bad!" and built progressive frankensteined torrents of XP
[13:33:23] p_l: (also, probably something crappily coded didn't work on Vista/7)

[16:00:22] nirvdrum: It may just be that I type like a sasquatch, but those chicklet keys are anything but ergonomic.  Besides lacking curvature, they're half height and hit the backplane rather rigidly.
[16:00:51] nirvdrum: So, they induced a lot of joint pain.
[16:01:20] AutomatedTester: i actually like it
[16:01:26] nirvdrum: The wrist pain is there and certainly wasn't aided by the wonderful cerated edge that Apple decided to add as par of the unibodies.
[16:02:32] nirvdrum: This laptop has a chicklet keyboard (most do now -- thanks Apple), but it's softer for me *shrug*
[16:02:45] nirvdrum: I was also typing an insane amount.

[21:00:03] SupplyCrawler: Okay, well, uh
[21:00:19] SupplyCrawler: First I gotta figure out why it won't interact at all with anything after the first .get
[21:11:06] SupplyCrawler: the page is loading, .get is finishing
[21:11:12] SupplyCrawler: but it just sits there when it's trying do do like a uh
[21:11:18] SupplyCrawler: get_all_elements_by_tag_name
[21:11:35] SupplyCrawler: Anyone know what that might be? (Firefoxdriver, python)

[23:36:08] jleyba: Does FF20 require another Selenium release?
[23:39:45] barancev|2 has joined #selenium
[23:39:59] dude-x: usually it does for native eventsâ€¦.
[23:43:07] dude-x: the good news is that FF20 seems to work with 2.31
[23:43:16] dude-x: at least on my mac.
[23:43:25] lukeis: heh, native events == false ;)
[23:43:28] barancev|2: synchronized events, yes
[23:43:36] dude-x: but i can't test native events on the mac.
[23:43:43] lukeis: not until mday
[23:43:43] barancev|2: synthesized, even :)
[23:43:43] selbot2: M-Day: day in the future when Marionette is made available for non-debug builds
[23:43:51] dude-x: synthetic
[23:44:22] dude-x: v23 will have invisible scrollbars on the mac
[23:44:29] dude-x: come to think of it, they should fix scrolling on the mac
[23:44:31] dude-x: it's slow
[23:44:49] barancev|2: hmm... IE9 does not support submit buttons outside a form?
