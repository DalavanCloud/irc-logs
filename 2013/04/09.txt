[00:51:25] nirvdrum: jarib: It looks like jimevans got you what you needed?  Tests were failing for safari & firefox for me.
[00:53:35] jarib: nirvdrum: what sort of failures?
[00:53:50] nirvdrum: It didn't seem to ever start the browser.
[00:54:44] nirvdrum: I had to pause the VM.  I'll take a look again in a bit.
[00:57:21] jarib: it's interesting if it's caused by platform differences.. i have to call it a night, but i'll read the backlog tomorrow.

[10:52:25] Ardesco: the local server that is  serving pages
[10:52:44] Ardesco: look alike it's not rendering templates properly
[10:53:10] uffs: well, those are javascript templates (plate.js, to be precise)
[10:53:28] uffs: actual backend-rendered templates render alright
[10:55:21] uffs: but why doesn't it run javascript properly? perhaps it fails to load javascriptâ€¦
[10:55:38] uffs: how can I make sure javascript is loaded correctly?
[10:56:05] uffs: I would check the paths, but as I can't have page source, I wonder how to go about that

[13:58:41] cuauhtemoc: When I run remotely with IE, I have 15 errors out of 36 tests. All errors are timeout for page load. 
[13:59:02] cuauhtemoc: And the run is extremely slow.

[14:53:33] selenium855: Hi. I am using latest Selenium with Firefox 19.0.2 on Linux and it's running very slow while Chrome is fine.What's the recommended  or version that you use with no problem?
[14:56:13] llaskin: selenium855: what do you mean "very slow"
[14:56:59] selenium855: llaskin: The tests, like sendKey and etc
[14:58:02] selenium855: it's stiopping after each action and moving on after 1-4 secs
[14:58:02] Jedicus_: O
[14:58:14] wolcanus has joined #selenium
[14:58:57] llaskin: selenium855: do you have waits setup somewhere?
[14:59:10] selenium855: llaskin: Nope, none
[14:59:38] Jedicus_: I'm brand new to selenium as of yesterday.  I made a test case for a problematic sharepoint site we have.  Right now it's designed with explicit 30 second wait times.  is there a waitFor assertation that I can use to detect when the "spinning wheel" animation in sharepoint is complete?
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Apr  9 15:00:07 2013]
[15:00:07] selenium855: same test runs just fine in Chrome. I was curious if its from my distro, or specific FF version or Selenium
[15:00:11] llaskin: Jedicus_: are you using the IDE or selenium webdriver?
[15:00:15] Jedicus_: IDE
[15:00:25] Ardesco has joined #selenium
[15:00:50] llaskin: Jedicus_: you have to identify whta the spinning wheel is in the DOM
[15:00:51] llaskin: and then wait for it
[15:02:20] Jedicus_: Thanks.  I should be able to catch it loading as sometimes the 30 second wait isn't enough.  :)
[15:08:25] intchanter has joined #selenium
[15:09:56] RossPatterson: Um, I'm pretty sure the "spinning wheel" is the Windows "window is busy" cursor - the replacement for the hourglass.  I'm also pretty sure you can't wait for that because it isn't a DOM object.
[15:10:24] RossPatterson: Jedicus_: Are you using "click" or "clickandwait" operations?

[15:20:14] RossPatterson: Ooh, that's completely different!
[15:20:52] RossPatterson: That's pretty easy to deal with.
[15:21:27] RossPatterson: You need to figure out a locator that describes the "spinner", then wait for it to be visible, then wait for it to not be visible.
[15:21:28] Jedicus_: Ok.  I have my hands pressed together and am staring at the screen waiting.  :)
[15:23:09] Jedicus_: sounds good.  Thanks!  I swear half the reason this site is so slow is that the vendor made us deploy 5 servers.  a TMG, 2 load balanced IIS, and a separate SQL.  We'll be lucky to ever have 200 concurrent users, but it takes 60 seconds for 1 user to load.
[15:23:40] RossPatterson: Something like: clickAndWait <buttonlocator> / waitForElementPresent <spinnerlocator> / waitForElementNotPresent <spinnerlocator>

[16:04:09] rstrazhnyk: hi guys! I have such a code. http://pastebin.com/gfMqJJ2k the salutation is selected in webdriver using Select(driver.find_element_by_id("salutation")).select_by_visible_text(salutation)
[16:04:50] rstrazhnyk: is there a possibility to emulate user, e.g. click and then select with the mouse or smth like that
[16:04:53] rstrazhnyk: ?
[16:06:35] Dude-X: rstrazhnyk: yes. then you can click
[16:06:40] Dude-X: i'll take a look at your code
[16:07:06] rstrazhnyk: ok i can click on id salutation, and then what's next
[16:07:31] rstrazhnyk: if not select, can i just click on "Mr" or "Mrs"
[16:07:33] rstrazhnyk: ?
[16:07:47] dimacus: rstrazhnyk:  what you can do is then find the element you want and do another click
[16:08:03] rstrazhnyk: ok 
[16:08:12] dimacus: Select(driver.find_element_by_id("Mrsâ€¦.. however you find it")).click
[16:08:27] rstrazhnyk: ok i will try
[16:08:31] dimacus: is there a specific JS event trigered when you do a change on the select?
[16:08:35] rstrazhnyk: understand you point
[16:08:54] rstrazhnyk: its just selects
[16:09:00] rstrazhnyk: no JS
[16:09:15] rstrazhnyk: the form is submitted only later
[16:09:20] rstrazhnyk: by another button
[16:09:56] dimacus: Dude-X:  correct me if i'm wrongâ€¦ but isn't there just a "select" command that would work bettern thatn click to expand the select and then click on option?
[16:10:27] rstrazhnyk: why I am asking this, because if disable this selector in firebug, it is still can be changed by webdriver
[16:10:54] rstrazhnyk: i mean if there is some error on the page, webdriver will not handle this
[16:10:55] Dude-X: rstrazhnyk: you will want to enable native events 
[16:11:01] rstrazhnyk: test will pass
[16:11:15] rstrazhnyk: enable native events?

[16:15:59] lukeis: i have about 1.5 hours of meetings, after them i'll kick it off (so, in about 2 hours)
[16:16:34] barancev|2: i'm going to push some changes to HtmlUnitDriver in a ~hour, with staleness checks, to fix the broken test
[16:16:41] rstrazhnyk: Dude-X ,  this must enable the feature? http://pastebin.com/AsepAYzJ
[16:16:50] barancev|2: may be I'll be in time for the release
[16:17:37] lukeis: ok, likely will be
[16:17:45] Dude-X: rstrazhnyk: yes
[16:17:54] lukeis: barancev|2: update the changelog if you think it warrants it
[16:18:02] Dude-X: native events can make tests up to twice as slow though on linux
[16:20:09] barancev|2: lukeis: it's a brand new test, nothing is broken compared to 2.31
[16:20:16] rstrazhnyk: well, expain this to my QA manager :)
[16:20:32] lukeis: barancev|2: ok :)
[16:22:07] rstrazhnyk: Dude-X: but visually I will not notice anything while running the test, right?
[16:22:29] rstrazhnyk: except of slowliness
[16:22:30] Dude-X: visually you won't see a mouse cmoving
[16:23:06] rstrazhnyk: but if I disable the element , it can't be changed like with the select
[16:23:09] rstrazhnyk: right?
[16:23:24] Dude-X: the extra slowness might mean things may render correctly (web driver is sometimes so fast that some widgets do crazy things because of the speed/interruption
[16:23:38] Dude-X: if the element is disabled web driver should throw an exception if you click on it
[16:23:44] Dude-X: you can still "get" it

[19:29:25] Baygon: thanks :)
[19:30:57] barancev|2: to fix this test I was forced to implement map support in executeScript parameters. thanks, jimevans! )
[19:31:53] jimevans: sorry. i meant to disable that test for htmlunit, but i forgot to yesterday.
[19:33:02] barancev|2: np, already fixed
[19:33:50] barancev|2: I mean, you could create a test that passes a simple single webelement, not a map of lists and arrays of something :)
[19:35:16] barancev|2: to be precide, the test was created by alex savchuk
[19:35:26] barancev|2: *precise
[19:37:43] Baygon has joined #selenium
[19:38:44] jimevans: and to be fair, passing in a single webelement was properly checked for staleness, but not if it were in a list or map (in IE, which is what the bug fix was designed to correct)

[20:43:16] *stephend nods
[20:43:38] stephend: I'm hot for that, too -- it'll let us do in-executable/binary concurrency w/multi-process :-)
[20:43:47] stephend: i.e. cut our test-execution times by 1/3 or more
[20:43:54] lukeis: nice
[20:44:00] stephend: it's what we used to have
[20:44:07] stephend: but then linux screwed it up
[20:44:24] stephend: with that test mode enabled, there used to be a focus issue
[20:44:33] lukeis: well, just need to figure out how to potentially exclude that from FF10 in selenium
[20:44:51] lukeis: which should be possibleâ€¦ just someone needs to spend the time ;)

[21:04:20] asavchuk: your are welcome :) no, i don't
[21:06:46] asavchuk: so 2.32 is out already. my patches may be only in 2.33. ok, i'll wait
[21:07:24] lukeis: that's correctâ€¦ hopefully we don't wait until the next ff release for 2.33 ;)
[21:08:52] asavchuk: why? is ffdriver already not based on ff sdk?
[21:09:42] lukeis: each of the selenium releases needs to be rebuilt on the latest sdk to support 'native events'
[21:13:27] barancev|2: why SessionNotFoundException is in remote?
[21:14:44] barancev|2: HtmlUnitDriver is not "remote", but it should throw SessionNotFoundException on any operation after quit
[21:15:23] barancev|2: so we get a bad dependency on remote package
[21:16:15] lukeis: we need a point release? this something newly discovered or recently introduced?
[21:17:31] barancev|2: lukeis: is your question related to my complain?
[21:17:38] lukeis: yes :)
[21:18:05] barancev|2: SessionNotFoundException is in remote for ages
[21:18:17] lukeis: ok ;) then no point release
[21:18:23] barancev|2: sure
[21:18:56] barancev|2: I have a dilemma: move SessionNotFoundException  to the main api, or make htmlunit dependent on remote
[21:19:29] lukeis: the SessionNotFoundException class is a subclass of Remote??
[21:21:12] lukeis: oh, it's in the package...
[21:21:18] lukeis: yeah, that should get moved out
