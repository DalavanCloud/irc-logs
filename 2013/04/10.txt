[08:25:37] frab: Hi, I'm having problems with starting selenium with chrome webdriver, I've added export PATH=$PATH:/selenium/chromedriver to .bashrc but I still get the error that the path must be set by the webdriver.chrome.driver system property. What have i done wrong?
[08:26:29] ArSn has joined #selenium
[08:29:50] SeUser: frab: before you initialize the chrome driver - you will have to mention the path for the chrome driver
[08:29:53] SeUser: System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\pathto\\my\\chromedriver.exe");
[08:30:40] frab: SeUser: I'm using PHPUnit, what would be the equivalent in that?
[08:32:19] SeUser: i havent used php.. so you may have to google on that...
[08:33:58] SeUser: something like this... $webdriver->connect("chrome","",array(     'webdriver.chrome.driver'=>'/usr/local/src/selenium/chrome_webdriver/chromedriver',     ));
[08:35:42] frab: Ah finally figured it out, I just added a symlink to the driver in /usr/local/bin and now it works

[09:58:46] SeUser: but, just asked is there any other approach to verify a maxlength validation for a given field Test case.

[10:01:10] Ardesco: sendKeys() more characters than the field can take
[10:01:18] Ardesco: then read back the value and count the number of characters
[10:02:38] SeUser: in my application.. the field wil not take more than the maxlenght defined.
[10:02:39] asavchuk has joined #selenium
[10:03:04] SeUser: for e.g i have a 30 as a maxleght defined.. and suppose If I have some 35 characters to be given as Input 
[10:03:31] SeUser: and i just paste those 35 chars into the field, then the field itself will take only 30 
[10:03:49] SeUser: the same while typing.. cannot type more than 30 defined.
[10:03:57] SeUser: so do we need to check that as well ?
[10:04:22] Ardesco: well i wouldn't bother in browsers that support the max-length attribute
[10:04:28] Ardesco: as the browser vendor deals with that for you
[10:05:42] Ardesco: here's a useful site to tell you what supports what
[10:05:43] Ardesco: http://caniuse.com/#feat=form-validation
[10:05:59] Ardesco: to be honest it depends upon your acceptance criteria
[10:06:30] Ardesco: IE will probably let you type in any number unless there is some javascript preventing character going beyond a certain length
[10:07:07] Ardesco: and its trivial to override max-length so if it's a real requirement you should tweak the attribute on the fly manually and try and send in longer characters and check that the server deals with them
[10:07:11] vila has joined #selenium
[10:07:27] Ardesco: but that's not really a selenium test IMHO but something for manual exploratory tests

[19:58:38] losh: Like resolution, codec encoding, audio etc?
[19:58:40] Dude-X: like maybe you can extract bitrate of the video playing

[19:59:43] Dude-X: it's difficult to automate against video unless the devs put javascript hooks 
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Apr 10 20:00:16 2013]
[20:00:16] losh: That may be an option.  What are these javascript hooks you're talking about?
[20:00:18] Dude-X: and if you use Adobe Flash, then you'd need to have the flash expose data via hooks in the container
[20:01:33] Dude-X: a contrived example would be: d.execute_script("return videoPlayer.bitrate")
[20:02:09] Dude-X: but the VideoPlayer dom object would exist because the video player or the script will actively publish such an object to the DOM
[20:02:54] losh: It appears to be a flash based video stream, so that would be the case.  OK, I see what you referring too.  Since the video stream is delivered to a flash container, selenium wouldn't be able to pull the metadata with hooks
[20:03:14] losh: without hooks rather
[20:03:17] Dude-X: right
[20:03:31] jleyba: jimevans: yt?
[20:04:19] losh: Dude-X:  OK, that's a great help thanks so much for the infromation.  Are there any specs on what sort of metadata I could pull from a flash container?
[20:04:34] Dude-X: whatever the developers put in
[20:04:57] Dude-X: that is, if your team is writing the software, you can ask them to expose certain things to the DOM
[20:05:05] Dude-X: via ActionScript or whatever

[20:09:54] ddary has joined #selenium
[20:11:05] jrendell: losh: question/suggestion- is Selenium the right tool for trying to get info about video? I did a quick google search on "measure quality of video stream jitter ffmpeg vlc" - got some papers with references to tools etc. Maybe it'd be useful for you to have a set of non-Selenium video tests re the stream quality etc. You can do this in dependant of what your flash devs add for testability.  Also info from the flash container may not be about the stream,
[20:11:06] jrendell: about the players abilities.
[20:16:00] losh: jrendell: You make a good point.  I was fixed on the idea of using Selenium to navigate to the URL (which is constructed dynamically and eventually times out), but if the selenium execution environment gives me access to underlying libraries such as ffmpeg or vlc to perform analysis on the video stream once I have the URL, that would probably be better.
[20:16:35] jrendell: losh: yeah I get (selenium) hammer syndrome too - we got to look out for each other on that one :)
[20:16:55] dhpe: agreed, selenium doesn't sound like the right tool for that.
[20:17:38] jrendell: Also, depending on your test infrastructure, you could potentially have a selenium test that navigates to the right page, and then extract the URL of the video, and have your test start a (sub) test that does the video testing… depending on how hard it is to get the URL of the video from your streaming server.
[20:18:02] losh: jrendell: :D  Much appreciated.  I'll sift through the results on the search you suggested and see what I can glean.
[20:18:45] jrendell: losh: you're very welcome- sounds like you have an interesting set of problems to figure out :)
[20:18:55] losh: jrendell: Yip, that sounds like a better method to go about the end to end testing I'm looking for.
[20:22:05] barancev: ok, it's me. dependencies...
[20:22:17] losh: jrendell: Yes, there are some interesting problems to be figured out.  I'd like to be able to contribute back to the community if I find/build a solution that's general enough to be used outside my specific use cases.

[22:05:23] intchanter-work: sfbrian: There are others, but it depends what you're looking for.
[22:05:52] intchanter-work: https://blog.mozilla.org/webdev/2011/04/14/a-humane-python-test-runner/ mentions nose-progressive, which changes how nose works a bit.
[22:05:58] sfbrian: all I want is a low footprint test runner that can do multiprocess, output in xunit and works with django :)
[22:06:22] sfbrian: nose doesn't work because of this issue: https://github.com/nose-devs/nose/issues/2
[22:06:38] sfbrian: pytest works but uses way too much memory when you go past 40 threads
[22:06:50] gdennis has left #selenium
[22:07:55] barancev: unittest?
[22:08:12] barancev: ah, you want parallel runs
[22:08:45] intchanter-work: sfbrian: I don't know of one that meets your requirements offhand.
[22:09:27] sfbrian: I wish I was smart enough to write my own one
[22:09:34] sfbrian: thanks for the help anyway intchanter-work 
[22:09:46] intchanter-work: Would probably be easier to troubleshoot and fix one of the existing solutions.
[22:10:47] qaguy has joined #selenium
[22:11:08] intchanter-work: Assuming a strong enough background in troubleshooting resource usage in multithreaded applications, of course.
[22:11:25] intchanter-work: But that would be necessary for writing from scratch as well.
[22:11:37] sfbrian: I know santiycr has looked into fixing that issue above. It requires pretty much re-writing all of nose

[22:28:25] santiycr has joined #selenium
[22:28:35] sfbrian: i haven't heard of xunitmp
[22:28:38] asavchuk: we use it, is has some problems, but usually it works.
[22:28:40] sfbrian: does that actually work with nose?
[22:28:46] sfbrian: and multiprocess
[22:29:04] sfbrian: how many threads can you get up to with that?
[22:29:06] asavchuk: https://github.com/rdiankov/openrave/blob/master/test/noseplugins/xunitmultiprocess.py
[22:29:39] asavchuk: i'm not sure that it's official link
[22:31:49] asavchuk: yes, it works. we found some statistics problems, stranges with SkipTests but is doesn't affect main function.
[22:32:43] asavchuk: we use it with 10/20 threads right now based on SUT.
[22:35:50] sfbrian: asavchuk: I can get pytest up to about 35 threads before it sucks up all the 8GB of memory
[22:36:11] sfbrian: i'll look into it though
[22:38:17] Hammertime38 has joined #selenium

[23:22:27] lukeis: jcarr: here's something I just showed in a meeting https://www.evernote.com/shard/s307/sh/210df20c-1c81-4d00-9ea4-e0abc006af49/3f36964e133febb557c41a4cb9d1d563  (specific to one of our most used android apps)
[23:23:29] jcarr: lukeis: wow. that's good data!
[23:24:08] lukeis: feel free to umm steal, maybe not free to credit me as giving it though ;)
[23:24:16] jcarr: haha, yeeeah
[23:25:06] jcarr: you are seeing more users on 4.1 and 4.2 than the market generally. interesting.
[23:25:07] lukeis: i'd like to note the lack of honeycomb usage ;)
[23:25:21] jcarr: yeah, I'm not even working on HC for sauce right now
[23:25:28] jcarr: just kinda pretending it doesn't exist
[23:25:46] lukeis: we are going to support 4.0+ only soon
[23:25:54] jcarr: from that graph, I understand why
[23:26:06] jcarr: less than 20% of your customers are on anything else.
[23:26:10] lukeis: yep
[23:26:29] jcarr: 2.3 is still the largest chunk for android, generally
[23:26:34] jcarr: about 40% IIRC
[23:26:56] jcarr: ah, yep http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html
[23:27:22] lukeis: yeah, our customers are different than 'the whole world' ;)
[23:27:37] jcarr: indeed, but interesting. I hope your customers are just where the market is going
[23:28:33] lukeis: likely
[23:28:57] lukeis: the whole 2yr contract up and getting a new cheap phone seems to be happening
[23:29:43] lukeis: ~2 years i will be able to drop instrumentation based testing and do UIAutomator only ;)
[23:29:54] lukeis: (assuming WebViews get supported)
[23:30:52] jcarr: I expect API18 to add webviews
[23:31:02] Hammertime38 has joined #selenium
[23:31:06] jcarr: do you know if webviews in android support attaching a debugger?
[23:31:27] lukeis: only on a real device
[23:31:41] jcarr: seriously?
[23:31:42] lukeis: in 'debug' mode
[23:31:52] jcarr: wait, where is that setting
[23:32:43] lukeis: http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html   "Enable USB debugging on your device." section
[23:34:41] jcarr: huh
[23:34:51] jcarr: everything in there is enabled by default in the emulator
[23:34:53] lukeis: i like the part about tapping 7 times ;)
[23:35:19] jcarr: should've been the konami code
[23:35:58] lukeis: there's somewhere that mentions you can't do it on an emulator… i'm not seeing it right now, but it pained me to read it in the docs
