2011-08-03T01:54:14  <eranm> binken, I ran into this problem long ago , it was working at a certain point and is not working anymore.
2011-08-03T01:55:10  <eranm> I'd really like to understand why it doesn't work but it's not high on my list on priorities. There are bigger things missing from the interactions API (like scrolling past the viewport and supporting modifier keys properly) which I'd like to get done first.
2011-08-03T01:55:38  <eranm> ah, he left.
2011-08-03T01:55:50  <AutomatedTester> you scared him away eranm
2011-08-03T01:57:06  <eranm> Not surprising.
2011-08-03T01:58:34  <eranm> btw, AutomatedTester as you may or may not know, the version we use internally is a bit behind trunk. At a certain point, the Python bindings were updated (separately from the java code we have checked in) and the Firefox driver stopped working
2011-08-03T01:58:55  <AutomatedTester> eranm: dont suppose you have more info for me
2011-08-03T01:59:06  <eranm> After some digging yesterday , I found out that the port chosen for the httpd inside the Firefox extension is not being picked up from the profile
2011-08-03T01:59:18  <eranm> so user.js contains the right value for webdriver_firefox_port
2011-08-03T01:59:36  <AutomatedTester> ok, thats set by the python code
2011-08-03T01:59:43  <eranm> but it seems like Firefox extension shrugs it off and listens to the default port, 7055
2011-08-03T01:59:54  <AutomatedTester> interesting
2011-08-03T02:00:01  <eranm> To add to the fun, this is Firefox 3.6.18 provided by Ubuntu
2011-08-03T02:00:20  *** sdqali has joined #selenium
2011-08-03T02:00:21  <AutomatedTester> when you find out more let me know
2011-08-03T02:00:36  <eranm> If you have any clue, I'd be happy to hear. If not, I'm going to try this again with a proper version of Firefox and if that doesn't change much I'll keep digging further
2011-08-03T02:01:29  <sdqali> Hi
2011-08-03T02:01:43  <sdqali> Has anyone tried v 2.3 with IE 9 yet?
2011-08-03T02:02:06  <sdqali> Looks like it is unable to click button
2011-08-03T02:02:07  <sdqali> s
2011-08-03T02:02:41  <AutomatedTester> eranm: we are using it in Mozilla without any issue but we aren't testing Firefox 3.6
2011-08-03T02:06:00  <sdqali> Even more weird, the driver is unable to click any links
2011-08-03T02:06:41  <AutomatedTester> sdqali: we have tests that would catch that
2011-08-03T02:06:48  <AutomatedTester> can you give us more info
2011-08-03T02:07:25  *** krosenvold1 has left #selenium

2011-08-03T02:09:44  <sdqali> That should have taken me to Google's Hindi page. It does not and it does not throw any exceptions
2011-08-03T02:10:53  <sdqali> Sorry, it should have navigated to the Maps page

2011-08-03T02:34:53  <simonstewart> Feeling like utter crap again today
2011-08-03T02:35:00  <simonstewart> Not impressed
2011-08-03T02:35:12  <jarib> sdqali: works well in IE9 for me https://gist.github.com/1122275
2011-08-03T02:35:48  <jarib> (i doubt java vs ruby would matter)
2011-08-03T02:35:52  <sdqali> jarib: Thanks. But I was testing with the Java version, though
2011-08-03T02:35:56  <simonstewart> dawagner: I reckon that the BasicMouseInterfaceTests should be passing for IE if you're looking for candidate tests to unignore
2011-08-03T02:36:24  <dawagner> simonstewart: I think I'm just going to run the lot and see what happens :) But thanks for the pointer
2011-08-03T02:36:34  <jarib> sdqali: they both make the same calls to the IE driver.
2011-08-03T02:36:35  <simonstewart> "Chaos" might happen
2011-08-03T02:36:44  <dawagner> The chaos is half the fun
2011-08-03T02:36:52  <simonstewart> Certainly in the early days we were able to reduce the entire system to a completely unworkable state by running tests
2011-08-03T02:38:41  <simonstewart> Ugh. Looks like the nasty rounded tabs of eclipse might be invading Firefox

2011-08-03T02:40:46  <jarib> just checked, he's right
2011-08-03T02:40:47  <AutomatedTester> isnt that the same as #2077

2011-08-03T02:40:51  <simonstewart> odd
2011-08-03T02:41:16  <jarib> ah
2011-08-03T02:41:20  <jarib> it's enter vs return, probably
2011-08-03T02:41:26  <sdqali> jarib: I rewrote in Java - https://gist.github.com/1122291
2011-08-03T02:41:29  <jarib> hmm, no
2011-08-03T02:41:36  <sdqali> Does not 'click' teh link
2011-08-03T02:42:27  <jarib> sdqali: can you reproduce on a page that's not google? it's a poor example since it's so heavily localized
2011-08-03T02:42:33  <jarib> ideally static html
2011-08-03T02:43:03  <jarib> your example works well for me
2011-08-03T02:43:34  <sdqali> jarib: I will try on another site.
2011-08-03T02:43:47  <jarib> actually, it is ENTER vs RETURN
2011-08-03T02:44:06  <jarib> e.g. Keys.RETURN will create keycode 14
2011-08-03T02:44:20  <jarib> but on a mac keyboard, it doesn't matter
2011-08-03T02:44:28  <jarib> close as WontFix?
2011-08-03T02:44:37  <simonstewart> Surely it's working as intended?
2011-08-03T02:44:48  <jarib> right. forget we have that status

2011-08-03T03:01:14  <jarib> it needs to have the same setting (on or off) for all zones
2011-08-03T03:01:28  <sdqali> jarib: I have already taken care of that
2011-08-03T03:01:57  <sdqali> jarib: without that setting, teh browser will not launch
2011-08-03T03:02:19  <jarib> true, but there could be a bug in the detection of the protected mode settings

2011-08-03T03:47:46  <jimevans> any elements?

2011-08-03T03:53:59  <jimevans> sdqali: any luck?
2011-08-03T03:55:38  <sdqali> jimevans: not yet :-)
2011-08-03T03:55:58  <jimevans> did you check that the zoom settings on the browser are set to 100%?
2011-08-03T04:00:18  <sdqali> jimevans: That was it.
2011-08-03T04:00:41  <sdqali> Changing it to 100% fixed it.
2011-08-03T04:00:52  <sdqali> I wonder why, though
2011-08-03T04:01:05  <sdqali> Thankss jimevans and jarib
2011-08-03T04:01:08  <jarib> jimevans: can we detect the zoom setting programatically?
2011-08-03T04:01:24  <jimevans> because the driver miscalculates the click coordinates when the zoom is not 100%
2011-08-03T04:01:44  <jimevans> jarib: i think so. i looked into it on one occasion, but got distracted by other matters.
2011-08-03T04:02:03  <jarib> that'd be nice
2011-08-03T04:02:04  <sdqali> The driver failing depending on the zoom level is a bit week, isn't it?
2011-08-03T04:02:18  <jimevans> it's documented behavior in the wiki.
2011-08-03T04:02:50  <sdqali> jimevans: I would love to look into fixing it, but I am kind of busy for two weeks

2011-08-03T04:19:09  <AutomatedTester> pythonirc101: i havent created them yet
2011-08-03T04:19:14  *** csanchez has quit IRC
2011-08-03T04:19:27  <AutomatedTester> but you can dir(selenium) to get the methods
2011-08-03T04:19:39  <AutomatedTester> and then .__doc__ them to get the documenation
2011-08-03T04:19:51  *** csanchez has joined #selenium
2011-08-03T04:20:05  <pythonirc101> how do i find out which version of seleniumpython is installed?
2011-08-03T04:20:21  <pythonirc101> AutomatedTester: perhaps add a selenium.__version__ ?
2011-08-03T04:20:51  <AutomatedTester> to what though/
2011-08-03T04:20:53  *** csanchez has quit IRC
2011-08-03T04:20:56  <AutomatedTester> since there are 2 libraries
2011-08-03T04:21:26  <pythonirc101> import selenium; print selenium.__version__
2011-08-03T04:22:38  <AutomatedTester> this raises a question for simonstewart
2011-08-03T04:22:48  <AutomatedTester> since we have Selenium 2 which is meaningless
2011-08-03T04:23:00  <simonstewart> Short version of the question?
2011-08-03T04:23:02  <AutomatedTester> if I version again selenium should I report 1.0.3
2011-08-03T04:23:15  <AutomatedTester> and webdriver 2.3.0?
2011-08-03T04:23:27  <AutomatedTester> since selenium was frozen
2011-08-03T04:23:28  <simonstewart> both versions are 2.3
2011-08-03T04:23:44  <simonstewart> It's one library that happens to have two apis
2011-08-03T04:24:07  <pythonirc101> perhaps let selenium.webdrive.__version__ differ from selenium.__version__?
2011-08-03T04:24:30  * AutomatedTester really hates version numbers 
2011-08-03T04:24:48  <adamgoucher> leave the version 2.3; thats what it is
2011-08-03T04:24:50  <dawagner> Ajay: hi
2011-08-03T04:25:13  * adamgoucher now wanders away from the version discussion to avoid getting grouchy
2011-08-03T04:25:51  <simonstewart> I'm agreeing with adamgoucher
2011-08-03T04:25:54  <AutomatedTester> pythonirc101: raise an issue and I will look at it
2011-08-03T04:27:13  * pythonirc101 tests
2011-08-03T04:28:06  <adamgoucher> simonstewart: oh. and atlassian have a plugin for bamboo that does start/stop of vms that they have used internally (in fact, the docs link i sent the other day was a copy/paste from it). except that its deprecated internally as they are moving to just using Elastic Bamboo instances for agents. but i think i'm going to get my hands on the code anyways
2011-08-03T04:28:22  <simonstewart> Indeed
2011-08-03T04:28:42  <simonstewart> Elastic Bamboo won't help us much as we want to test on OSs not available on EC2
2011-08-03T04:30:04  <adamgoucher> but if we have the code for the plugin, it becomes another bit of project infrastructure to maintain when apis change, etc. much like crazyfun is infrastructure.
2011-08-03T04:30:26  <simonstewart> True. I'd like to see Atlassian maintain the plugin
2011-08-03T04:30:34  *** soc42 has quit IRC

2011-08-03T04:31:22  <adamgoucher> i got the impression that isnt going to happen. they havent made it available before now and dont want to have to maintain it. suspect the code is non-pretty :)

2011-08-03T04:37:40  <Ajay> dawagner: Getting meaningful names for the test is more difficult than creating a patch
2011-08-03T04:38:05  <dawagner> Naming is everything!
2011-08-03T04:38:41  <simonstewart> dawagner: care to make some suggestions for names?
2011-08-03T04:38:42  <simonstewart> \
2011-08-03T04:39:02  <dawagner> Could create a new class: GetMultipleAttributeTest, which means there is less to worry getting in to the test names
2011-08-03T04:39:15  <Ajay> yeah i am scratching my head to get the meaningful names
2011-08-03T04:39:47  <simonstewart> So the rule of thumb for these things is to describe roles and responsibilities
2011-08-03T04:39:53  <dawagner> Things like GetMultipleAttributeTest.testIsNotMultipleWhenNoMultipleAttributeItSet?

2011-08-03T05:24:40  <eranm> We're keeping it for rendered browsers - the things it can do are implemented
2011-08-03T05:24:46  <eranm> (until we get it atomized as well)
2011-08-03T05:28:00  <simonstewart> dawagner: I have no intention of doing it

2011-08-03T05:29:41  <Ajay> Should <select multiple> returns false right ?
2011-08-03T05:30:04  <dawagner> From HTML4 it would return true
2011-08-03T05:30:10  <dawagner> Try it in the browsers and see what happens? :)
2011-08-03T05:31:40  <simonstewart> I really dislike drag and drop right now
2011-08-03T05:31:40  <dawagner> What about the svg stuff? "Not yet implemented" or "Not going to be implemented" in HtmlUnit?
2011-08-03T05:33:11  <simonstewart> dawagner: I doubt we'll implement it
2011-08-03T05:33:16  <simonstewart> Unless it works "accidentally"
2011-08-03T05:33:43  <simonstewart> For now: assume that if it passes on HtmlUnit that's great
2011-08-03T05:33:54  <simonstewart> But it's a low priority compared to (say) IE or Firefox
2011-08-03T05:34:11  <dawagner> Ok :)

2011-08-03T06:30:42  <AutomatedTester> eranm: PYTHONPATH
2011-08-03T06:31:08  <krosenvold> dawagner: Are there loops in the tests ? ;)
2011-08-03T06:31:09  <eranm> export PYTHONPATH=$SVN_ROOT/py ?
2011-08-03T06:31:11  <AutomatedTester> or there is a utility step in crazy-fun that installs it to your site packages
2011-08-03T06:31:24  <AutomatedTester> eranm: yea
2011-08-03T06:31:28  <eranm> Let's try that
2011-08-03T06:31:33  <AutomatedTester> or you can do ./go py_install
2011-08-03T06:31:40  <eranm> (where does it pull the Firefox extension from?)
2011-08-03T06:31:53  <jarib> krosenvold: fortunately, we don't use loops in this project
2011-08-03T06:32:02  <AutomatedTester> you will need to move it manually to the firefox directory

2011-08-03T06:32:42  <AutomatedTester> ./go py_install builds everything and then installs it locally

2011-08-03T06:50:47  <eranm> note that I don't even have to pass the profile to the driver  for the test to break - enough that I enable native events on something.

2011-08-03T06:54:40  <AutomatedTester> eh?
2011-08-03T06:55:07  <davehunt> adamgoucher: the editor location is a dependancy for the mozmill tests

2011-08-03T06:55:45  <AutomatedTester> eranm: issue with the persons code?
2011-08-03T06:55:53  <AutomatedTester> or my code?
2011-08-03T06:56:00  <eranm> AutomatedTester, firefox_profile.py line 136, for example. self.default_preferences is shared between different instances of FirefoxProfile
2011-08-03T06:56:07  <davehunt> adamgoucher: I'm sure I can work it out - automation would be ideal :)
2011-08-03T06:56:28  <AutomatedTester> is it?
2011-08-03T06:57:18  <AutomatedTester> eranm: that would imply all variables are shared between instances
2011-08-03T06:59:03  <eranm> AutomatedTester, let me verify
2011-08-03T06:59:57  <AutomatedTester> setting the value in the dictionary is done via properties not instance methods

2011-08-03T07:01:29  <eranm> (it would not happen if class_value was assigned with a new value in set_value. If that was the case, self.class_value would shadow SomeClass.class_value. But that's not what we're doing)

2011-08-03T07:59:47  <eranm> krosenvold, can you send a full build log? It'd also help if you tweak the rake files a bit (rake-tasks/crazy_fun/mappings/gcc.rb) so we can see the compilation and linkage lines

2011-08-03T08:43:41  <eranm> krosenvold, you only need to delete third_party/gecko-1.9.2/linux. And as for xulrunner-dev package, as I mentioned - we don't use it anymore because there are enough official versions of Firefox to build for.

2011-08-03T09:00:55  <dawagner> When sending Cookies over JSON, would we prefer optional fields not specified to be undefined in the object, or null in the object?
2011-08-03T09:01:39  <simonstewart> undefined
2011-08-03T09:01:48  <dawagner> Ok :)
2011-08-03T09:01:57  <krosenvold> pardon the naive question, but isn't there a semantic difference ?
2011-08-03T09:02:12  <krosenvold> (Which supports undefined)
2011-08-03T09:02:40  <simonstewart> undefined means "has no value set", null means that the value has been set, and it's null
2011-08-03T09:03:02  <krosenvold> as expected
2011-08-03T09:03:26  <simonstewart> so unset optional fields are most accurately referred to as undefined

2011-08-03T09:33:39  <krosenvold> It would seem like the file is corrupt
2011-08-03T09:33:47  <eranm> should be into third_party/gecko-1.9.2/linux
2011-08-03T09:33:57  <eranm> The file from mozilla? odd

2011-08-03T09:34:37  <krosenvold> I dont have the file ;)
2011-08-03T09:35:14  <krosenvold> I deleted third_party/gecko-1.9.2/linux

2011-08-03T09:40:08  <eranm> First, you can get around by fetching this file yourself, unpacking it and moving it to third_party/gecko-1.9.2/linux (so underneath this folder there's bin, inc, etc)
2011-08-03T09:40:13  <eranm> second, I'll have a closer look :)
2011-08-03T09:40:22  <krosenvold> Yup, the url is 404'ing me
2011-08-03T09:40:44  <krosenvold> wget http://download02.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.9.2.18/sdk/xulrunner-1.9.2.18.en-US.linux-i686.sdk.tar.bz2 work
2011-08-03T09:40:46  <krosenvold> works
2011-08-03T09:41:50  <eranm> Good
2011-08-03T09:43:59  <krosenvold> eranm: I doubt that url is an officical one, but it seems to be building here with that. I'm sure there's someone around here who can find out about that ?
2011-08-03T09:46:38  * krosenvold wonders if there's any way to make the downloads from mozilla fail the build if they 404
2011-08-03T09:46:43  <eranm> The URLs are taken from here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko_SDK
2011-08-03T09:47:12  <eranm> krosenvold, it's a neat idea. jarib probably knows how hard that'd be.

2011-08-03T09:50:58  <krosenvold> Slightly embarrasing way of fixing that problem ;)
2011-08-03T09:51:35  <krosenvold> Is that a straightfoward upgrade assuming the tests pass ?
2011-08-03T09:52:43  <eranm> krosenvold, sure.
2011-08-03T09:53:25  <krosenvold> eranm: Do mozilla support "old" versions? Or do they simply remove them ?
2011-08-03T09:53:55  <eranm> That's a question AutomatedTester may be able to answer better. I guess the reason for a minor version bump to an old SDK was a security fix?
2011-08-03T09:54:02  <XRayCulver> is Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll custom or provided by Ionic?

2011-08-03T10:08:38  <simonstewart> falling back to prebuilts is the reason we have 'em
2011-08-03T10:09:10  <jarib> krosenvold: what target is 404ing on you?

2011-08-03T10:10:11  <farlan> can anyone clear this up for me?  I am using a custom firefox profile for selenium tests (I have a plugin installed and configured in this profile), but when I  Selenium starts firefox, the plugin is not there.  Here's what
2011-08-03T10:10:17  <farlan> I'm doing:     	File profileDir = new File ("/Users/user/Desktop/plugin-profile");     	FirefoxProfile firefoxProfile = new FirefoxProfile(profileDir);         WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(firefoxProfile);
2011-08-03T10:13:14  <krosenvold> jarib simonstewart Shouldnt fallback be limited to those cases where the architecture cant build them ? At *minimum* we need to give a better message
2011-08-03T10:13:24  <simonstewart> absolutely
2011-08-03T10:13:44  <simonstewart> But even if we download the gecko sdk, we don't know whether the build should work
2011-08-03T10:13:51  <simonstewart> (missing gcc, or other deps)
2011-08-03T10:14:37  <simonstewart> And if I try and build this thing on a plane and it craps out because it can't download the gecko sdk I'm going to be deeply unhappy
2011-08-03T10:16:31  <krosenvold> Will it fail on your flight if you already have the deps ?
2011-08-03T10:17:44  <simonstewart> Who knows.
2011-08-03T10:17:55  <simonstewart> I sometimes have a pristine checkout to check things against
2011-08-03T10:18:14  <simonstewart> Which quite often has never had anything downloaded to it
2011-08-03T10:18:17  <krosenvold> I think that's why this one has slipped by; I was unable to build 2.3.0 because I used a clean machine
2011-08-03T10:18:36  <krosenvold> A clean checkout
2011-08-03T10:18:48  <simonstewart> And that's why I want all our dependencies in source control

2011-08-03T10:19:44  <krosenvold> I think we have to ship the source on cd-rom soon
2011-08-03T10:19:45  <algard> farlan, I had more luck just added the extension I wanted (firebug) to the profile
2011-08-03T10:20:35  <simonstewart> If we could do without the entire mozilla sdk and if the libraries we need from it were smaller, the world would be a happier place
2011-08-03T10:21:33  <ato> Or if we could host the libraries on a *cough* faster server ourselves. d-:

2011-08-03T11:42:40  <AutomatedTester> krosenvold: its probably available via the FTP server
2011-08-03T11:43:17  <AutomatedTester> i would be suprised if its no where to be found

2011-08-03T11:47:28  <AutomatedTester> is that what your are after?
2011-08-03T11:47:57  <krosenvold> That seems a little suspicious, like a staged version for a release or something ?
2011-08-03T11:48:57  <krosenvold> I dont think so. Our problem is that we have hardcoded links to the xulrunner-dev versions, and if they keep changing all the time we're in trouble
2011-08-03T11:49:34  <krosenvold> And it also means we can't reconstruct a previous version of selenium because the appropriate xulrunner stuff may not be there any more
2011-08-03T11:49:52  <AutomatedTester> hmm
2011-08-03T11:50:15  <AutomatedTester> tbh we need to move away from the XULRunner approach get JSCtypes working

2011-08-03T13:42:28  <lukeis> this is RC
2011-08-03T13:42:49  <adamgoucher> it would have to be to futz with headers, but just double checking :)
2011-08-03T13:42:58  <randy_> good question, I'm new to selenium, but I think RC is the answer
2011-08-03T13:44:22  <randy_> how does the go.bar that runs the ruby script fit in here? or does it?

2011-08-03T13:49:34  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-08-03T13:49:37  <lukeis> you should move to use WebDriver instead of RC if you are new to Se :)
2011-08-03T13:50:32  <lukeis> some reading material (some of this is out of date) http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html
2011-08-03T13:51:36  <randy_> So is RC basically deprecated in favor of WebDriver?
2011-08-03T13:51:40  <lukeis> yep
2011-08-03T13:52:38  <randy_> Excellent info, I'd say the impress you get by going to http://seleniumhq.org/ is the furthest possible from that
2011-08-03T13:52:44  <lukeis> RC will only get compatibility updates for new browsers for a while, no api changes... WebDriver is being actively worked on. But is not 100% feature complete across all browsers
2011-08-03T13:52:55  <adamgoucher> but. you cant muck with the headers and such in webdriver

2011-08-03T13:53:50  *** Fyrespray has joined #selenium
2011-08-03T13:56:01  <lukeis> you can't muck with headers directly with webdriver... you can with a proxy in place though ;)
2011-08-03T13:56:46  <randy_> So ok, if we want to write JUnit tests and have them executed from a continous integration server is the WebDriver with the auth link you provided the right way to go? or is WebDriver plus a proxy or WebDriver plus RC?
2011-08-03T13:57:22  <randy_> Any my test case was taken right out of the IDE to JUnit 4, so is that not a proper way to create tests currently?
2011-08-03T13:57:44  <randy_> and I clearly mucked around with the test after...
2011-08-03T13:57:46  <lukeis> depends on what you really need to do.... i don't use IDE myself
2011-08-03T13:59:04  <lukeis> I'd say just start writing tests in the code... usually you can start describing what you think you want to do in terms of finding items on the page and clicking things where the test code will eventually start coming out (no need for IDE)
2011-08-03T13:59:04  <randy_> I really just need to do regression testing of a pretty complicated mapping web app that has basic auth over https
2011-08-03T13:59:37  <randy_> I'm cool just coding straight.
2011-08-03T13:59:41  <lukeis> ok... so you won't need a proxy... if you saw the examples of how people were using WebDriver in that issue i linked, you should be good to go
2011-08-03T13:59:59  <randy_> ok I'll start exploring that tonight and tomorrow
2011-08-03T14:00:05  <randy_> thanks for the direction

2011-08-03T14:07:04  <__phil__> hi all.  Zend auto-generates some of the HTML code so I lose the ability at times to manually code in a name or id attribute for some divs. See: http://pastebin.com/7ubJwdDE
2011-08-03T14:07:28  <__phil__> is there a way in CSS or XPATH to say "go up one level"?
2011-08-03T14:08:25  <__phil__> that way I'd have the ability to reference "name=active" and then go up one level and then ask for div[2], thereby be able to get the date field in the next div

2011-08-03T15:22:15  <jarib> sdimkov: pong
2011-08-03T15:23:08  <sdimkov> got an interesting reply for the bug we discussed yesterday(chrome not clicking <a><img></a>)   http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=91420
2011-08-03T15:23:16  <jarib> i saw that
2011-08-03T15:23:59  <sdimkov> oh ok, google was saying that only 1 person starred the ticket so I thought to give a heads up.
2011-08-03T15:24:28  <jarib> yep. i think that's reasonable
2011-08-03T15:24:45  <sdimkov> I'm still investigating it. doesn't make sence to me that the <a> tag would have center outside its content
2011-08-03T15:28:19  <jarib> the inspector shows it quite clearly
2011-08-03T15:28:46  <sdimkov> yep I see. just checked on all browsers. it's not a quirk of their dev-tools. the center is indeed there
2011-08-03T15:29:20  <sdimkov> but still , for me that is still a bug
2011-08-03T15:29:24  <jarib> if you enable native events for firefox, you'll probably see the same behaviour
2011-08-03T15:29:30  <sdimkov> ?
2011-08-03T15:29:52  <sdimkov> well that would just mean we have the same bug with ff
2011-08-03T15:30:42  <sdimkov> I mean from logical point of view. click() is expected to click the content of an element. So naturally it would have to pick a clickable point to do so. Or in the case of the atoms send element event
2011-08-03T15:31:14  <jarib> well, every point is clickable
2011-08-03T15:31:22  <jarib> some just trigger a different action
2011-08-03T15:31:37  <jarib> you can argue that we should calculate where inside the <a> the image is, and click there instead of the center
2011-08-03T15:31:47  <sdimkov> good point, might be harder then I think to determine a right spot
2011-08-03T15:32:03  <sdimkov> that is what I was trying to say
2011-08-03T15:32:12  <jarib> but i can assure you it will be a very low priority bug :)
2011-08-03T15:32:21  <sdimkov> sure
2011-08-03T15:32:31  <sdimkov> it's a rare case
2011-08-03T15:32:36  <sdimkov> and has an obvious work-around
2011-08-03T15:32:42  <sdimkov> but still a bug :)

2011-08-03T15:33:13  <sdimkov> but I don't think FF with native events does that
2011-08-03T15:33:32  <jarib> it should click the center
2011-08-03T15:33:39  <sdimkov> I've run IE9  , FF4 and FF5 on win7 x64  with the same tests without problem
2011-08-03T15:33:49  <sdimkov> I believe native events were on by default
2011-08-03T15:33:58  <sdimkov> never set them explicitly
2011-08-03T15:34:21  <sdimkov> I'll check it again. but I'm almost sure that will work fine under win with ff and ie
2011-08-03T15:34:53  <jarib> ok, so either FF behaves differently, or we're not clicking the center
2011-08-03T15:35:06  <sdimkov> I'm tryign as we speak
2011-08-03T15:35:24  *** Mayank has joined #selenium
2011-08-03T15:36:06  <sdimkov> yep
2011-08-03T15:36:09  <sdimkov> works
2011-08-03T15:37:58  <sdimkov> works on IE too
2011-08-03T15:37:59  <jarib> right, watching the mouse cursor in firefox, the whole link appears to be clickable
2011-08-03T15:38:22  <jarib> where in chrome it clearly isn't
2011-08-03T15:38:49  <jarib> so may actually be more a bug in chrome than chromedriver
2011-08-03T15:40:14  <sdimkov> interesting
2011-08-03T15:41:09  <sdimkov> although I doubt that would be considered bug there. Too many eyes watch chrome to miss that, maybe it's so by design. Every browser maker works very hard to have its own quirks :D
2011-08-03T15:41:56  <jarib> indeed they do
2011-08-03T15:46:18  <sdimkov> my mistake. The area isn't clickable in IE9 as well. so it doesn't work there.
2011-08-03T15:46:30  <jarib> aha
2011-08-03T15:46:39  <jarib> that's probably where webkit got it from
2011-08-03T15:47:27  <sdimkov> speaking of webkit, works in Safari too(it's clickable)

2011-08-03T15:48:25  <sdimkov> works in opera.
2011-08-03T15:48:54  <jarib> doesn't work in safari here.
2011-08-03T15:49:06  <sdimkov> haven't tried trough driver
2011-08-03T15:49:07  <jarib> (5.1)
2011-08-03T15:49:13  <sdimkov> just checked if it's clickable
2011-08-03T15:49:20  <sdimkov> can I run safari driver on win ?
2011-08-03T15:49:25  <jarib> me neither, webdriver doesn't support safari
2011-08-03T15:49:36  <sdimkov> Ive heard some safari driver talk
2011-08-03T15:49:43  <sdimkov> maybe still beta?
2011-08-03T15:50:20  <jarib> an implementation was started, but it's not actively worked on

2011-08-03T15:51:02  *** dhackner has quit IRC
2011-08-03T15:52:50  <sdimkov> just to see if I understand it right. Chromedriver has better implementation overall for clicking? As it always simulate mouse click even with native events off ?
2011-08-03T15:53:21  <jarib> right
2011-08-03T15:54:05  <jarib> it's sort of in between a synthesized click (i.e. atoms) and a native click
2011-08-03T15:54:28  <sdimkov> I see
2011-08-03T15:54:29  <jarib> since they can fire a "webkit click event"
2011-08-03T15:54:57  <sdimkov> side question: Is there an option move the mouse on top of the clicks performed
2011-08-03T15:55:20  <jarib> what language are you using?
2011-08-03T15:55:32  <sdimkov> nope I meant within webdriver
2011-08-03T15:55:39  <sdimkov> from my side I know I could do it.
2011-08-03T15:55:46  <sdimkov> ruby on linux mainly
2011-08-03T15:56:07  <sdimkov> but my question was are there plans to add something like a switch  move_mouse_on_clicks =  true/false
2011-08-03T15:56:21  <sdimkov> just like native_events,  firefox_profile .. etc
2011-08-03T15:57:07  <sdimkov> would be usefull for recording tests.
2011-08-03T15:57:15  <jarib> not sure what you mean by move the mouse in this context?
2011-08-03T15:57:40  <sdimkov> I meant if webdriver would simulate a click on a given element, it would move the mouse over it as it clicked
2011-08-03T15:57:48  <jarib> the click atom fires mouseover, mousemove etc
2011-08-03T15:57:50  <sdimkov> to show visually what it did
2011-08-03T15:57:54  <jarib> ah
2011-08-03T15:58:04  <jarib> moving the actual mouse cursor is not planned, no
2011-08-03T15:58:12  <sdimkov> yep that was my question :)
2011-08-03T15:58:25  <jarib> i think that's non-trivial to do
2011-08-03T15:58:41  <sdimkov> probably at a multi-os as in this case
2011-08-03T15:58:43  <jarib> if not impossible
2011-08-03T15:59:15  <sdimkov> ah I would argue here
2011-08-03T15:59:30  <sdimkov> but yet I'm not an expert in this :)
2011-08-03T16:00:25  <sdimkov> I mean I've made such os-specific things back in the days and have moved the actual mouse cursor.

2011-08-03T16:01:11  <sdimkov> under linux there is XTest lib for x11. there is even a user-friendly wrapper (xdotool)
2011-08-03T16:02:28  <sdimkov> under windows I think it was done through WshShell
2011-08-03T16:04:20  <jarib> aha
