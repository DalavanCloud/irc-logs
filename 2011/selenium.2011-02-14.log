2011-02-14T02:26:50  <simonstewart> Eran's been working on it with a team here in Tokyo
2011-02-14T02:27:00  <simonstewart> ato: that's impressive.
2011-02-14T02:29:20  <simonstewart> Right. My WIn7 box is alive
2011-02-14T02:29:27  <simonstewart> Time to try and get a release out
2011-02-14T02:29:29  <simonstewart> How hard can it be?
2011-02-14T02:35:37  <jarib> great
2011-02-14T02:36:12  <simonstewart> Was most narked that my win7 box was dead for so long
2011-02-14T02:36:19  <simonstewart> I'd really just want to call it a night now
2011-02-14T02:36:28  <simonstewart> But I should also check that the IE stuff works as expected
2011-02-14T02:36:30  <simonstewart> :)
2011-02-14T02:38:59  <jarib> yep. updated prebuilts would be good for the ruby gem as well
2011-02-14T02:39:42  <simonstewart> eran has already updated the prebuilts, i think
2011-02-14T02:44:32  <jarib> ah, ok
2011-02-14T02:51:42  <simonstewart> I'll also update "stuff" once I get it working
2011-02-14T02:52:17  <simonstewart> Oh, this is going to be a long night.
2011-02-14T02:52:31  <simonstewart> I notice that the IE driver is compiling everything every time
2011-02-14T02:52:48  <simonstewart> I suspect because the atoms get written out every time too
2011-02-14T02:53:04  <simonstewart> Let's see if this test is failing because of a timing issue or not
2011-02-14T02:54:38  <simonstewart> OK. It's a timing issue
2011-02-14T03:13:51  <simonstewart> Right. Timing issue the first dealt with

2011-02-14T03:26:30  <simonstewart> Once I get the IE driver building good and clean, I'm going to do a release
2011-02-14T03:26:37  <AutomatedTester> oooo
2011-02-14T03:26:50  <simonstewart> But first, I need the thing to build cleanly
2011-02-14T03:26:59  <simonstewart> Right now, submit is returning too fast
2011-02-14T03:27:06  <simonstewart> which is causing lots of tests to fail

2011-02-14T03:30:16  <AutomatedTester> i can disable the test thats failing...
2011-02-14T03:30:28  <AutomatedTester> its failing because of an issue in an atom

2011-02-14T03:43:12  <simonstewart> I'm on it now
2011-02-14T03:43:19  <AutomatedTester> but I dont touch that code so havent felt the need
2011-02-14T03:43:34  <simonstewart> Right.\
2011-02-14T03:43:43  <simonstewart> I spent the weekend fixing the normal build on OS X and Linux

2011-02-14T04:31:47  <AutomatedTester>  in your ruby tests do you handle /r/n vs /n ?
2011-02-14T04:32:28  <jarib> i don't think so. where would that be needed?
2011-02-14T04:32:37  <AutomatedTester> in my typing tests
2011-02-14T04:32:55  <jarib> don't think i have tests for that
2011-02-14T04:33:17  <jarib> i'm keeping the ruby tests mostly about testing the ruby code, not the drivers
2011-02-14T04:33:31  <jarib> i'm relying on the java tests covering most of the drivers
2011-02-14T04:34:05  <AutomatedTester> i use my tests to make sure that my API is the same as the Java code
2011-02-14T04:34:06  <jarib> if i had a \r\n vs \n bug in the ruby code, i'd add a test for it, obviously
2011-02-14T04:34:33  <jarib> ok

2011-02-14T04:57:00  <simonstewart> I'm >< this close to ignoring the failing tests for the IE selenium emulation
2011-02-14T04:57:04  <simonstewart> That's bad of me, right
2011-02-14T04:57:05  <simonstewart> ?
2011-02-14T04:57:16  <AutomatedTester> depends
2011-02-14T04:57:21  <AutomatedTester> are the tests of value?
2011-02-14T04:57:40  <simonstewart> It shows that in some cases the xpath emulation ain't quite right
2011-02-14T04:57:48  <simonstewart> For IE
2011-02-14T04:58:12  <AutomatedTester> the browser was left open on my Win7 box
2011-02-14T04:58:37  <simonstewart> But it's hard to gauge how many people are using it.
2011-02-14T04:58:42  <simonstewart> Yeah. It does that
2011-02-14T04:58:46  <simonstewart> Did the tests pass?
2011-02-14T04:59:00  <AutomatedTester> no
2011-02-14T04:59:04  <AutomatedTester> 4 failed
2011-02-14T04:59:13  <AutomatedTester> how do you see which ones failed?

2011-02-14T05:00:06  <jarib> been a while since i ran them though.
2011-02-14T05:00:20  <jarib> this is for getText?
2011-02-14T05:00:25  <AutomatedTester> jarib: i dont get that issue with Chrome and Firefox on Windows
2011-02-14T05:00:29  <simonstewart> open the index.html in the build/test_logs directory
2011-02-14T05:00:30  <AutomatedTester> jarib: yea
2011-02-14T05:00:47  <jarib> AutomatedTester: i think last time i tried, the IE driver wasn't using the getVisibleText atom
2011-02-14T05:01:02  <jarib> but it should be doing that now
2011-02-14T05:01:14  <AutomatedTester> i'll speak to Jim later...
2011-02-14T05:02:13  <AutomatedTester> ahh found it

2011-02-14T05:15:25  <simonstewart> Why is that a *sigh*?
2011-02-14T05:16:21  <AutomatedTester> because Spolsky thinks the Selenium Stackexchange stuff should fall under there
2011-02-14T05:16:50  <simonstewart> I can see that as an argument

2011-02-14T05:22:21  <simonstewart> Are you kidding me?
2011-02-14T05:22:52  <simonstewart> Right.
2011-02-14T05:23:22  <simonstewart> The add locator strategy test is failing because "driver.navigate.refresh()" is puking with the IE driver
2011-02-14T05:25:12  <denizt> speaking of refresh why dont we have stop in navigate, could be useful at times

2011-02-14T05:25:55  <denizt> we have it in opera, when a page load times out
2011-02-14T05:26:14  <denizt> we stop it (page load timeot = window-loaded not received in timeout period)
2011-02-14T05:28:21  <simonstewart> It's probably a Good Thing to add
2011-02-14T05:29:23  <simonstewart> Ha!
2011-02-14T05:29:35  <simonstewart> The IE driver doesn't implement refresh
2011-02-14T05:43:21  <rb2k> hmmm, is it possible that selenium clicks so fast that javascript hasn't been binding to certain links yet?

2011-02-14T08:45:28  <ammar01> the driver object
2011-02-14T08:45:42  <jarib> webdriver or Se1?
2011-02-14T08:46:15  <jarib> for webdriver, the answer is no
2011-02-14T08:46:15  <ammar01> the webdriver bindings (2.0)
2011-02-14T08:46:18  <ammar01> ok
2011-02-14T08:46:42  <ammar01> I know I can make a direct status check through ruby itself - but would like to check http status during a browser session
2011-02-14T08:46:52  <jarib> loading a page rarely means fetching a single resource
2011-02-14T08:47:08  *** mbeierl has joined #selenium
2011-02-14T08:47:30  <jarib> we generally recommend using a proxy (like the browsermob proxy) if you want to monitor the actual traffic
2011-02-14T08:47:50  <jarib> i'm not aware of any nice, scriptable HTTP proxy in ruby though
2011-02-14T08:47:53  <jarib> having one would be awesome
2011-02-14T08:48:54  <ammar01> thanks i'll look a using a proxy - would just be nice to do an "inline" quick check for a 303 redirect

2011-02-14T10:08:20  <xirkus> I have a question regarding the latest 2.0; can it only be compiled under windows to support the IE driver? If so, can I do it using the community edition of VS or do a need a developer edition of VS?
2011-02-14T10:09:12  <jimevans> xirkus: yes, it must be compiled under windows; no you cannot use the express editions, Visual Studio 2008 Professional or higher is required.
2011-02-14T10:09:46  <xirkus> jimevans: thanks. is there documentation regarding the build process that I can read up on?
2011-02-14T10:09:47  <jimevans> the reason is that the C++ COM interop code uses the Active Template Library (ATL), which isn't included with the Express Editions.
2011-02-14T10:10:21  <jimevans> What questions do you have about the build process?
2011-02-14T10:12:50  <xirkus> I guess anything which would help resolve possible build issues and any other libraries that are required to perform a complete build. The company I work for requires the grid implementation that was recently committed and I noticed that there was a significant rewrite of the IE driver.
2011-02-14T10:13:53  <jimevans> the IE driver build process will look for the presence of Visual Studio, and if it's not there, will fall back to pre-built binaries of the native code components.
2011-02-14T10:14:22  <xirkus> cool. any problems building using VS2010?
2011-02-14T10:14:26  <jimevans> yes.
2011-02-14T10:14:42  <jimevans> Visual Studio 2008 is required for building the native code components.
2011-02-14T10:14:51  <jimevans> VS 2010 will absolutely not work.
2011-02-14T10:15:32  <xirkus> the VS solution is for 2008 I assume and has not been upgraded to support 2010?
2011-02-14T10:15:50  <xirkus> or are there other dependencies?
2011-02-14T10:18:59  <jimevans> Everything should be statically linked in the build, but as I recall, we had some difficulty when compiling under 2010.
2011-02-14T10:19:36  <jimevans> We're using the TR1 extentions to the C++ STL (for regex support), and that caused some challenges.

2011-02-14T11:09:13  <ipmb> so, I guess my question would by, why is setup.py in /trunk/ instead of /trunk/py/?

2011-02-14T11:10:29  <ipmb> I'm wondering if it is a reasonable goal for Python devs to be able to get setup with standard python tools
2011-02-14T11:10:32  <AutomatedTester> its the "install part"
2011-02-14T11:10:47  <ipmb> that is, setuptools/distribute/pip and hide ./go
2011-02-14T11:11:17  <AutomatedTester> ipmb: we then need to delegate down to ./go from setup.py and then pop back

2011-02-14T12:20:14  <jarib> http://tttt.mine.nu/~jarib/watir-webdriver/spec-results/jari/2011-02-14/ie.html
2011-02-14T12:20:17  <jarib> vs
2011-02-14T12:20:17  <jarib> http://tttt.mine.nu/~jarib/watir-webdriver/spec-results/jari/2010-11-29/ie-new-driver.html
2011-02-14T12:20:29  <jimevans> yay. :)
2011-02-14T12:20:32  <jarib> the new one is running more specs to (i could remove some guards)
2011-02-14T12:21:02  <jimevans> well, let's not get crazy now... :)
2011-02-14T12:21:25  <jarib> i may have a crashing bug for you though
2011-02-14T12:21:28  <jarib> working on reducing it
2011-02-14T12:21:33  <jimevans> ok
2011-02-14T12:21:58  <jarib> during window switching
2011-02-14T12:23:29  <jimevans> fair enough. just out of curiosity, how do those results compare to firefox?
2011-02-14T12:23:37  <jimevans> or does firefox run green?
2011-02-14T12:23:38  <jarib> here are the remaining guards btw: http://tttt.mine.nu/~jarib/watir-webdriver/spec-results/jari/2011-02-14/ie.guards.txt
2011-02-14T12:23:45  <jarib> firefox is green but also has some guards
2011-02-14T12:23:50  <jarib> but less of them.
2011-02-14T12:23:57  <jarib> i can upload the results for that too
2011-02-14T12:24:11  <jimevans> i was just curious.
2011-02-14T12:25:21  <jimevans> looking at the spec guards, what's the difference between "not_compliant" and "deviates"?
2011-02-14T12:26:07  <jarib> deviates is where it's sort of an acceptable difference
2011-02-14T12:26:35  <jarib> like the order of attributes breaking a spec
2011-02-14T12:26:44  <jarib> or things like that
2011-02-14T12:26:57  <jimevans> ah. ok.
2011-02-14T12:27:26  *** just_a_coder has left #selenium
2011-02-14T12:27:27  <jarib> so not_compliant is sometimes accompanied by a deviates guard
2011-02-14T12:27:37  <jarib> you'll see the line numbers are close there
2011-02-14T12:27:51  <jarib> not really a perfect system, but it works ok

2011-02-14T12:32:02  <jimevans> xirkus: I'm pretty sure Standard will work, but not 100% sure.
2011-02-14T12:32:18  <jarib> uploaded firefox.html and firefox.guards.txt as well.
2011-02-14T12:32:30  <xirkus> jimevans: thanks.
