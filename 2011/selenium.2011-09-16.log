2011-09-16T02:49:27  <webben> dapidmini: You could use it for load testing I guess ... it's just an automation tool, and you might need to load test something that requires more steps than just a simple curl hit.
2011-09-16T02:49:40  <webben> dapidmini: What do you mean by database testing?

2011-09-16T03:56:31  <jarib> looks nice

2011-09-16T03:56:43  <simonstewart> Aye
2011-09-16T03:56:59  <simonstewart> Turns out to be more expensive as a base cost than the venue we saw today
2011-09-16T03:57:04  <simonstewart> but has a lot more bundled in
2011-09-16T03:57:10  <simonstewart> including projectors and A/V kit
2011-09-16T03:57:25  <simonstewart> that will make a serious difference on the cost

2011-09-16T04:05:10  <simonstewart> If I sent you a pull request that replaced references to commons-io with guava-libraries equivalents, would that go down well?
2011-09-16T04:05:27  <andreastt> simonstewart: Stuk is currently working on upgrading to latest protobufs.  Should have that ready quite soon in HEAD.
2011-09-16T04:05:38  <andreastt> It should.
2011-09-16T04:05:42  <andreastt> Ajay: What's that?
2011-09-16T04:06:50  <Ajay> is the entire page screenshot supported ?
2011-09-16T04:07:22  <andreastt> No.  There's a bug with that in Opera.
2011-09-16T04:07:32  <andreastt> Basically, we don't generate the entire page.  Just the visible viewport.
2011-09-16T04:07:48  <simonstewart> Stuk: great news :)
2011-09-16T04:07:58  <Ajay> Thanks

2011-09-16T04:09:17  <simonstewart> If you want, I'd be happy to test that the patched version works as expected with the google infrastructure
2011-09-16T04:09:55  <Stuk> that would be great :)
2011-09-16T04:09:56  <andreastt> That would be great, because we're doing this to get Google testing with Opera (-;

2011-09-16T05:31:27  <Parabola> freynaud: why not have the grid do it?
2011-09-16T05:31:55  <Parabola> iirc it uses JSON for the registration right? can't we just throw that in there?
2011-09-16T05:32:20  <freynaud> Parabola: grid only forwards the request as they are
2011-09-16T05:32:55  <freynaud> Parabola: this bug is asking to change the way grid works basically, opening all the request, checking the content, and in some cases inject new info to it
2011-09-16T05:34:10  <Parabola> good point, it does just forward doesnt it
2011-09-16T05:34:27  <freynaud> if the nodes are not configured properly, my first guess is that the problem should be resolved there, not on the layer above it
2011-09-16T05:35:09  <Parabola> Would his request not be better served as "Have nodes verify correct information"
2011-09-16T05:35:24  <Parabola> ie, ensure the binary exists in that location?

2011-09-16T05:35:56  <Parabola> hm, that would be a duplicate then
2011-09-16T05:36:57  <simonstewart> I'm not sure which driver you're using, but it may well have to do with polling intervals
2011-09-16T05:37:15  <Parabola> although 6 is a little more complicated
2011-09-16T05:37:42  <Parabola> i'm not saying probe for available binaries, just verify the specified file exists

2011-09-16T06:17:59  <Parabola> what the heck does that mean?
2011-09-16T06:18:12  <simonstewart> unexpected alert, I think]
2011-09-16T06:18:19  <simonstewart> We've been getting a few reports of that
2011-09-16T06:18:26  <Parabola> did me changing my timeout to 3 seconds cause it?
2011-09-16T06:18:36  <Parabola> maybe i should go back to 2.5
2011-09-16T06:18:44  <Parabola> 2.6 hates me
2011-09-16T06:18:51  <simonstewart> 2.6 doesn't hate anyone
2011-09-16T06:19:02  <Parabola> you say that
2011-09-16T06:19:08  <Parabola> it also says it took a screenshot
2011-09-16T06:19:12  <Parabola> but where did it put it
2011-09-16T06:20:25  <Parabola> yeah, 2.6 isnt working so hot, now its failing to do stuff that work on 2.5
2011-09-16T06:23:12  <simonstewart> If you file bug reports we've got a fighting chance of fixing things
2011-09-16T06:23:25  <simonstewart> We spent bleedin' ages trying to get everything right
2011-09-16T06:23:32  <Parabola> I understand :)
2011-09-16T06:23:45  <Parabola> I can file a report, switched back to 2.5 everything works great again
2011-09-16T06:23:57  <Parabola> simonstewart: any particular data you want in the report?
2011-09-16T06:24:06  <simonstewart> Bug reports would (bizarrely) make us happy
2011-09-16T06:24:52  <Parabola> I will try to make that happen again and let you know
2011-09-16T06:24:58  <freynaud> bug reports with a patch makes me even happier :)
2011-09-16T06:24:58  <simonstewart> thanks
2011-09-16T06:25:01  <Parabola> i was having more of an issue with my timeout of not being enough
2011-09-16T06:25:11  <Parabola> 2.5 3 seconds was enough, 2.6 its not
2011-09-16T06:25:18  <Parabola> i cannot get one test to run
2011-09-16T06:26:18  <Parabola> is it appropriate to paste code snippets in my bug report?

2011-09-16T08:18:13  <XavierHardy> hello
2011-09-16T08:19:02  <XavierHardy> i have a question, i would like to know if it's possible to use HTML-formatted selenium with python webdriver
2011-09-16T08:19:29  <lord1234> no
2011-09-16T08:19:34  <lord1234> what do u mean html formatted?
2011-09-16T08:19:50  <XavierHardy> tests in html format
2011-09-16T08:19:50  <lord1234> as in can you copy code from HTML/Selenium IDE  straight in and run it using python ?
2011-09-16T08:19:53  <lord1234> no way.
2011-09-16T08:20:07  <lord1234> you can copy the tests out of the IDE in python format
2011-09-16T08:20:10  <lord1234> and that should work...
2011-09-16T08:20:17  <lord1234> long and short of it:  learn python
2011-09-16T08:20:20  <XavierHardy> yes, but for 100 tests
2011-09-16T08:20:23  <XavierHardy> i know python
2011-09-16T08:20:35  <XavierHardy> but our selenium tests are in html currently
2011-09-16T08:20:42  <lord1234> gues what your fun new task is?
2011-09-16T08:20:50  <lord1234> test conversion:)
2011-09-16T08:20:54  <lord1234> at least all the logic is already done!
2011-09-16T08:22:09  <XavierHardy> yeah, that's what i'm trying to avoid
2011-09-16T08:22:51  <XavierHardy> i prefer writing a script to migrate on the fly, rather than actually migrating
2011-09-16T08:23:14  <lord1234> u'll have to wait for the python folks to get here...but I think your only option is "migrating"
2011-09-16T08:23:18  <lord1234> also: stop using the IDE>
2011-09-16T08:23:28  <XavierHardy> i'm not using it
2011-09-16T08:23:30  <lord1234> good
2011-09-16T08:23:34  <XavierHardy> i'm using selenium core
2011-09-16T08:23:37  <lord1234> whoever wrote the HTML tests...tell them to stop using it
2011-09-16T08:23:39  <XavierHardy> the testBrowser
2011-09-16T08:23:43  <XavierHardy> why ?
2011-09-16T08:24:02  <lord1234> cuz its not how you write reusable test cases.
2011-09-16T08:24:53  *** mooose has quit IRC
2011-09-16T08:25:27  <XavierHardy> it's not pure html
2011-09-16T08:25:36  <XavierHardy> it's using TAL (Template Attribute Language)
2011-09-16T08:26:09  <XavierHardy> so it's fairly reusable
2011-09-16T08:26:44  <XavierHardy> but the first reason we use it, it's because it comes from zope's zelenium test environment
2011-09-16T08:27:22  <XavierHardy> btw, let's consider i'm still using selenium core and html
2011-09-16T08:27:35  <XavierHardy> how do i get it to do screenshots
2011-09-16T08:27:37  <XavierHardy> N
2011-09-16T08:27:38  <XavierHardy> ?

2011-09-16T09:00:44  <QAGuy> lukeis ruby
2011-09-16T09:02:20  <lukeis> there currently isn't a select support class in ruby... you'll have to locate the option element you want and then click it
2011-09-16T09:03:13  <QAGuy> lukeis So something like find_element(css 'element').click
2011-09-16T09:03:21  <lukeis> yep

2011-09-16T09:04:52  *** XRayCulver has joined #selenium
2011-09-16T09:05:31  <XRayCulver> am i correct in assuming that specific browser drivers are not threadsafe as RemoteWebDriver?
2011-09-16T09:06:11  <XRayCulver> or are all IWebDriver's threadsafe?
2011-09-16T09:06:47  <jarib> none of the drivers are thread safe (in the sense that you can share a single driver across threads)
2011-09-16T09:06:58  <jarib> as long as you use one driver per thread you should be good
2011-09-16T09:06:59  <XRayCulver> ok
2011-09-16T09:07:05  <XRayCulver> hmm
2011-09-16T09:07:08  <XRayCulver> thats what i was hoping
2011-09-16T09:07:19  <XRayCulver> i thougth i had an issue with it, i'll have to try it again
2011-09-16T09:07:28  <jarib> what was the issue?
2011-09-16T09:07:39  <XRayCulver> i don't remember
2011-09-16T09:07:50  <XRayCulver> but i fixed some issues since
2011-09-16T09:07:57  <lukeis> you also know you can only have one IE driver per box... but can have multiple ff and chrome
2011-09-16T09:08:07  <XRayCulver> that may be it
2011-09-16T09:08:26  <XRayCulver> i test almost exclusively against ie
2011-09-16T09:08:58  <XRayCulver> lukeis: do you mean spooling up multiple drivers of the same version or different versions?
2011-09-16T09:09:35  <lukeis> if you have a windows X box... which has IE Y on it... you can only have one driver running against it
2011-09-16T09:09:46  <XRayCulver> hmm
2011-09-16T09:10:03  <XRayCulver> i've had ie browsers running on one box before
2011-09-16T09:10:04  <lukeis> well, you could try multiple, but you may collide ;)
2011-09-16T09:10:16  <XRayCulver> that may be whats happening
2011-09-16T09:10:24  <XRayCulver> so the ie driver isn't threadsafe or?...
2011-09-16T09:10:39  <lukeis> you should stick to one version of IE per windows instance (vm or real machine)
2011-09-16T09:10:45  <XRayCulver> i do
2011-09-16T09:12:02  <lukeis> my understanding is that IE running doesn't separate it's sessions... so if you tried to run two drivers they both could essentially switch to the other's window
2011-09-16T09:12:16  <XRayCulver> hm
2011-09-16T09:12:17  <lukeis> would need to test that assumption though :)
2011-09-16T09:12:22  <XRayCulver> yes
2011-09-16T09:12:29  <XRayCulver> my framework will allow me to do that
2011-09-16T09:12:37  <XRayCulver> and i will be
2011-09-16T09:12:55  <XRayCulver> if i can't
2011-09-16T09:13:01  <XRayCulver> its no big deal to put a node on another pc
2011-09-16T09:13:22  <XRayCulver> or meby i'll go learn vm's and add one of those

2011-09-16T11:09:48  <meonkeys> Docs at http://seleniumhq.org/docs/05_selenium_rc.html#how-selenium-rc-works say that passing -h to Selenium Server (RC) should display help options. Doesn't work for me with selenium-server-standalone-2.6.0.jar and OpenJDK 1.6.0_22. Would someone else mind trying -h?
2011-09-16T11:10:11  <ebass> looking @ the JAva API there is no ByteStream...there is a ByteArrayInputStream and a ByteArrayOutputStream

2011-09-16T11:44:04  <meonkeys> lord1234: IMHO that one is a bit different; code change required. I think mine (#2477) is a documentation bug. I'll add "see also" comment to 2420, though.
2011-09-16T11:44:28  <lord1234> 2477 is a dupe of 2390

2011-09-16T12:32:26  <lord1234> also: have you considered that selenium supports more languages then windmill?
2011-09-16T12:32:32  <lord1234> windmill only supports Javascript if i read correclty
2011-09-16T12:32:56  <jgividen> windmill supports python and thats what I'm looking for
2011-09-16T12:33:18  <Nogem> I thought windmill was a log parsing tool
2011-09-16T12:33:27  <barancev> selenium has python api too
2011-09-16T12:33:32  <jgividen> ok good
2011-09-16T12:33:44  <lord1234> jgividen: well I use Ruby...so windmill is no good for me....

2011-09-16T12:36:04  <jgividen> obviously you all are biased ;)
2011-09-16T12:36:08  <lord1234> then why ask us?
2011-09-16T12:36:12  <lord1234> since you know our answer:)
2011-09-16T12:36:20  <jgividen> because why did you choose selenium?
2011-09-16T12:36:31  <Nogem> I'm just here to pester the experts
2011-09-16T12:36:31  <Ajay> jgividen:selenium is suited if you have multiple environments and multiple browsers to test
2011-09-16T12:36:58  <Ajay> u r code runs on different OS
2011-09-16T12:37:02  <lord1234> also how about this, #windmill has 10 people in it.  #selenium has well over 80....
2011-09-16T12:37:08  <lord1234> support base alone wins that fight.
2011-09-16T12:37:26  <jgividen> lord1234: makes sense to me
2011-09-16T12:37:28  <Ajay> and u can run the same code on Android
2011-09-16T12:37:40  <jgividen> Ajay: ah nice
2011-09-16T12:38:04  *** stepheneb has joined #selenium
2011-09-16T12:38:12  <Ajay> So u have Java,Python,C#,ruby bindings
2011-09-16T12:38:23  <Ajay> you can choose your language of your choice
2011-09-16T12:38:24  <Nogem> jgividen: I chose selenium because in nearly a decade of qa every other tool I've seen is either ridiculous and over hyped (like watr), ridiculous and overpriced (seapine), or just plain over priced for non fortune 500 companies (QTP)
2011-09-16T12:38:45  <barancev> well, nothing personal, I've been looking for a corossbrowser recorder, and WM claims they have such a thing. the only problem is that I can't make it run
2011-09-16T12:38:59  <Nogem> selenium gives a lot of options, and moving from IDE recording to export into the language of your choosing drastically scaled down the learning curve
2011-09-16T12:39:11  <jgividen> barancev: that's the problem I've had

2011-09-16T12:41:16  <jgividen> I haven't played around with Selenium yet but I'm definitely going to check it out
2011-09-16T12:42:04  <jgividen> thank you all for your help!
2011-09-16T12:42:11  <barancev> try it, and you'll fall in love with it :)
2011-09-16T12:42:34  <jgividen> I'll probably be back soon with questions
2011-09-16T12:42:37  <jgividen> ;)
2011-09-16T12:42:49  <Nogem> jgividen: I recently ran into an issue with some of my selenium implementation code. I came here and got direction to the right documentation. Where we ran into a limitation of Selenium I got in direct email contact with the developer working on that part of Selenium *and* got see selbot post in here when they checked in a fix
2011-09-16T12:43:00  <Nogem> hard to beat that level of support
2011-09-16T12:43:42  <jgividen> Nogem: awesome!
2011-09-16T12:44:01  <cgoldberg> jgividen, selenium/webdriver with Python is great.. dive right in for an afternoon and evaluate it yourself.  and also *really* consider how useful recording is to you (I personally don't use it all)
2011-09-16T12:44:14  <barancev> the real hardcode thing is strong browser vendors support for selenium
2011-09-16T12:44:44  <barancev> that gives credits
2011-09-16T12:44:48  <Nogem> especially considering the windmill demo won't even load in my other browser - that's not encouraging. I'll stick with this community.
2011-09-16T12:45:20  <jgividen> do any of you use recording?
2011-09-16T12:46:04  <barancev> not very often
2011-09-16T12:46:52  <jgividen> yeah, I feel like I could type up a script fairly quickly rather than going through each step in the browser
2011-09-16T12:47:03  <barancev> it is a good thing if you need to generate a piece of code like "fill form with the data" - no need to find element names ot ids
2011-09-16T12:47:35  <jgividen> barancev: good point
2011-09-16T12:47:41  <barancev> when you implement test logic you don't need recorder
2011-09-16T12:48:49  <lord1234> who the hell uses recording?
2011-09-16T12:48:56  <barancev> I am

2011-09-16T14:06:47  <Parabola> when i created it, i thought it was my timeout, increasing the timeout does fix the issues, but causes another one
2011-09-16T14:07:19  <barancev> no, #2458 is not a timeout issue

2011-09-16T14:10:00  <lukeis> lord1234: see my previous response?
2011-09-16T14:10:05  <barancev> there is info that 2.6 is significantly slower than 2.5
2011-09-16T14:10:33  <Fitzsimmons> I'm having this problem where my webdriver nodes only seem to handle a single instance, and will never pick up a job again until the daemon itself is restarted
2011-09-16T14:10:36  <barancev> I think that's the reason you have to increase timeouts
2011-09-16T14:10:47  <Fitzsimmons> meaning that each of my nodes can only be used once until I come and manually restart them. what gives?
2011-09-16T14:11:17  *** lord1234 has quit IRC

2011-09-16T14:11:28  <Fitzsimmons> yes
2011-09-16T14:11:56  <lukeis> and your driver calls quit at the end?
2011-09-16T14:12:08  <Fitzsimmons> it calls close. does it need to be calling quit instead?
2011-09-16T14:12:15  <lukeis> yeah, quit instead
2011-09-16T14:12:18  <Fitzsimmons> ok thanks
2011-09-16T14:12:50  *** ian_mac has quit IRC
2011-09-16T14:13:55  <lukeis> (for those listening too)... please call quit... if you use chrome and don't call it you'll end up with a chromedriver process for every driver you start... gets ugly after a while ;)
2011-09-16T14:14:38  <jarib> ruby has an exit hook to avoid that
2011-09-16T14:14:53  <lukeis> other bindings don't :)
2011-09-16T14:15:14  <barancev> let's add?
2011-09-16T14:15:32  <Fitzsimmons> uh, I'm using ruby and didn't encounter this helpful exit hook
2011-09-16T14:15:40  <Fitzsimmons> although perhaps my bindings version is lagging behind the current release
2011-09-16T14:16:13  <jarib> Fitzsimmons: are you saying ruby is leaving chromedriver processes running?
2011-09-16T14:16:28  <Fitzsimmons> oh, chromedriver? don't know
2011-09-16T14:16:48  <Fitzsimmons> but calling close instead of quit stops my webdrivers from handling more than one request
2011-09-16T14:16:50  <lukeis> he was using grid... and his grid wasn't releasing the browser (only way to do that is call quit)
2011-09-16T14:17:00  <jarib> right.
2011-09-16T14:17:02  <ruel> hey guys, when upgrading to 2.6 webdriver, i've noticed a regression when clicking on on objects that appear arent visible (due to scrolling).  Rolling back to 2.5 works fine.   Are there known issues around this?
2011-09-16T14:17:13  <ruel> (in firefox 6)

2011-09-16T14:18:24  <barancev> yes, #2458 is about broken autoscrolling

2011-09-16T14:21:18  <Fitzsimmons> I guess I'm asking if there's some type of multiplexing for the remote webdriver where it will run the same commands on several browsers and fail if any of them fail
