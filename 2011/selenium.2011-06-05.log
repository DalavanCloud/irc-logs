2011-06-05T04:01:26  <c089> hi everyone :) trying to implement tests using the new rc2 on firefox results in "native events are disabled on this platform"... what can I do about this?
2011-06-05T04:03:28  <c089> calling driver.getProfile().enableNativeEvents() does not help
2011-06-05T04:06:31  <barancev> c089: what OS do you use?
2011-06-05T04:07:02  <c089> ubuntu
2011-06-05T04:07:24  <c089> up-to-date system with ff4
2011-06-05T04:07:25  <barancev> from official release: Native events on Linux may not work properly on tests that include alerts and prompts
2011-06-05T04:08:08  <c089> nothing like that in the tests
2011-06-05T04:10:39  <barancev> I'm on Windows, sorry. you'd better come here tomorrow, all the people enjoy weekend now :)

2011-06-05T05:01:34  <c_mcintosh> would have been nice if instead of trashing the forums they found a way to save all of those docs
2011-06-05T05:02:52  <freynaud> ?
2011-06-05T05:03:05  <barancev> freynaud: yes, and I've seen your commit, thanks!

2011-06-05T05:03:40  <freynaud> would something along those lines solve you problem ?
2011-06-05T05:08:25  <barancev> yes, and -file option, r12366 is exactly what I wanted

2011-06-05T05:08:41  <freynaud> k
2011-06-05T05:08:48  <freynaud> there are probably some missing pieces
2011-06-05T05:09:17  <freynaud> for instance in the config; you need to specify the node URL, and you can use "ip"
2011-06-05T05:09:28  <freynaud> to have it replaced by the current ip
2011-06-05T05:09:56  <freynaud> that's the only dynamic param i thought about, but there may be more. Let me know if you need more dynamic parts
2011-06-05T05:10:40  <barancev> it's enough for now, may be some usability issues will come later
2011-06-05T05:10:57  <freynaud> i would assume so :)

2011-06-05T05:25:57  <barancev> freynaud: next thing that bother me is keeping nodes registered after hub restart - there is an issue #1718 on this
2011-06-05T05:25:58  <selbot2> francois.reynaud open/new Selenium 2 Grid RCs and WebDriver nodes need restart after hub failure. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1718
2011-06-05T05:27:11  <freynaud> i don't know how to fix this one yet, i have to think about it
2011-06-05T05:27:36  <barancev> it is not so critical in producton environment, but when working with trunk it is annoying
2011-06-05T05:27:59  <freynaud> why ?
2011-06-05T05:28:20  <barancev> may be it is possible to save node network layout in a file on stop, and load it after restart
2011-06-05T05:28:42  <barancev> when trunk rebuilt, I have to restart hub
2011-06-05T05:29:12  <barancev> but I don't want to restart nodes too
2011-06-05T05:29:16  <freynaud> i see
2011-06-05T05:29:44  <freynaud> that you should be able to do
2011-06-05T05:30:47  <freynaud> on your now, you will have something that looks like WebDriverDefaultNode.json
2011-06-05T05:31:28  <freynaud> if you pass that as a param using -file, it will start the node server, change ip by its value, send send the json file to the hub for registration
2011-06-05T05:32:10  <freynaud> if you know where your nodes are, you can save the node1.json, node2.json on the machine where you node is
2011-06-05T05:32:30  <freynaud> and generating the request yourself
2011-06-05T05:33:43  <barancev> sounds reasonable. atm I use shell script that restart nodes over ssh, sending a series of json requests would be much better
2011-06-05T05:34:44  <freynaud> you should even be able to do that using a fake node
2011-06-05T05:34:55  <freynaud> relaunch you hub
2011-06-05T05:35:12  <freynaud> then for every node that you know is up, on the hub machine for instance
2011-06-05T05:35:24  <freynaud> -role webdriver -file node1.json
2011-06-05T05:35:35  <freynaud> with node1.json having the proper ip
2011-06-05T05:35:58  <barancev> yes, I see
2011-06-05T05:36:07  <freynaud> and also register = false
2011-06-05T05:36:18  <freynaud> ah, no
2011-06-05T05:36:27  <freynaud> that the other way around sorry
2011-06-05T05:36:31  <freynaud> there is a pram missing
2011-06-05T05:36:56  <freynaud> register = true , startServerOnNode = false
2011-06-05T05:37:01  <freynaud> start server isn't done

2011-06-05T12:09:05  <lisak> guys does anybody know answer to the last part of this question ? http://stackoverflow.com/q/6215857/306488
2011-06-05T12:09:56  <lisak> if I get a WebElement,  and the element node changes in the browser, are the changes reflected to the instance of WebElement ?
2011-06-05T12:10:19  <lisak> does it work like reference/pointer ? like in JavaScript ?
2011-06-05T12:12:26  <barancev> lisak: I'd suppose you'll get StaleElementException if it is changed
2011-06-05T12:14:22  <lisak> so if I presume that node changes, I gotta "find" the element again to see the changes
2011-06-05T12:14:33  <lisak> because there is no  webElement.reload(); method
2011-06-05T12:14:51  <barancev> though, ià only an attrubute is changed -- may be it is not marked "staled"
2011-06-05T12:15:25  <barancev> in this case, yes, you'll see changed element, because WebElement acts as is a reference (pointer)
2011-06-05T12:16:00  <barancev> it contains element unique id only, not element data
2011-06-05T12:16:35  *** miker2 has quit IRC
2011-06-05T12:17:17  <lisak> specifically I'm talking about that a new css class appears on the element
2011-06-05T12:17:29  <lisak> for instance, validation-error
2011-06-05T12:18:01  <lisak> so that I do some action and then check for the presence of this css class
2011-06-05T12:18:07  <lisak> on the same instance of webElement
2011-06-05T12:18:44  <lisak> great
2011-06-05T12:19:23  <lisak> btw are the attribute names the same as in Javascript ?
2011-06-05T12:19:38  <lisak> kinda cannot find a way to print them all out
2011-06-05T12:20:31  <barancev> must be the same

2011-06-05T12:30:56  <lisak> it is just caching a pointer to a node on client side
2011-06-05T12:31:25  <lisak> I wasn't aware of the fact that webElements don't keep any state
