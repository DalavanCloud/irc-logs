2011-07-23T02:48:16  <monkeynipples> Hey I am running osx lion with 2.1 java server and python bindings and i cant seem to update the profiles preferences i've tried doing profile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile() profile.set_preference("","") profile.update_preferences() browser = webdriver.Firefox(profile) which seemingly creates new profile but no changes to about:config
2011-07-23T02:48:32  <monkeynipples> i've also tried manipulating Firefox.profile directly but does not seem to update

2011-07-23T10:00:44  <ner0x> I think it'll eventually make it there, this is my first fork of the project, so I'm not sure what they're going to do with it.
2011-07-23T10:00:54  <ner0x> I assume it'll eventually get there, all things perl do. :-)
2011-07-23T10:02:06  <ato> I was considering creating the Perl bindings myself because a department at work was interested in it, but it's great that you've done some work on this.
2011-07-23T10:02:26  <ner0x> I haven't had any part of it yet, just found it yesterday. :-)
2011-07-23T10:02:37  <ner0x> BUT I think it's great someone is maintaining the perl bindings.
