2011-09-30T00:17:05  <stackedsax> that's not a scalable solution
2011-09-30T00:17:17  <barancev> stephend: #2035 - is't it about long-running script too?

2011-09-30T00:17:26  <stackedsax> let's pretend I have several hundred VMs that this could happen on
2011-09-30T00:18:02  <stackedsax> how should I best avoid this error from ever happening ever again?
2011-09-30T00:20:13  <barancev> though... it is RC-related issue
2011-09-30T00:20:57  <stephend> barancev: we're using RC

2011-09-30T00:47:51  <stephend> though it looks fine
2011-09-30T00:47:58  <stackedsax> I mean, I could take out the -firefoxProfileTemplate again
2011-09-30T00:47:59  <stephend> the docs warned, but didn't explain
2011-09-30T00:48:27  <stackedsax> it's not an issue of Firefox not starting with the right template â€” that happens fine
2011-09-30T00:48:31  *** cerberos has joined #selenium
2011-09-30T00:48:40  <stackedsax> are you talking about the binary path?
2011-09-30T00:49:50  <stackedsax> I saw some posts that suggested explicitly setting the location of firefox.exe, but that makes zero sense to me.  It finds firefox.exe just fine right now...
2011-09-30T00:50:08  <stackedsax> The one thing I couldn't quite tell:
2011-09-30T00:50:38  <stackedsax> by default Selenium will create a profile and then use that profile to start up, and does so with -no-remote on
2011-09-30T00:50:51  <stackedsax> when I use a custom profile, is -no-remote being used?
2011-09-30T00:51:31  <stackedsax> it looks like it will use the custom profile I set and create new instances of that profile and then start up firefox using those new profiles it just created
2011-09-30T00:51:33  <stephend> I think they've changed the docs a bit
2011-09-30T00:51:35  <stackedsax> but I could be wrong
2011-09-30T00:51:44  <stackedsax> I was looking at the code
2011-09-30T00:52:06  <stephend> stackedsax: oh, could be (binary path)
2011-09-30T00:52:10  <stephend> it's literally been a year
2011-09-30T00:54:33  <stephend> if the profile's in use (as you suspect, it could be that), then that message correlates
2011-09-30T00:54:49  <stackedsax> it only happens some of the time
2011-09-30T00:54:53  <stephend> hrm
2011-09-30T00:55:04  <stackedsax> there's some timing issue that has been worsened by my new profile
2011-09-30T00:55:11  <stephend> in the actual tests?
2011-09-30T00:55:18  <stackedsax> possibly because I made firefox much faster...

2011-09-30T01:44:55  <Ajay> Stuk: hey
2011-09-30T01:47:09  <stackedsax> not sure whether it's related to the "firefox already running" error, but both started happening when I started using a custom profile
2011-09-30T01:47:29  <stackedsax> anyone else here starting their grid RC's using a custom profile?
2011-09-30T01:53:29  <stackedsax> shucks, I guess I'm unique in my problems
2011-09-30T01:56:12  <Stuk> Ajay: yo
2011-09-30T01:57:55  <Ajay> Should we Assert. or continue with static imports
2011-09-30T01:58:31  <Ajay> i think test cases should have a uniform standards , i can work on that if you can confirm
2011-09-30T02:01:47  <stackedsax> here is what I'm seeing in my output: http://pastebin.com/R6SGcUyB
2011-09-30T02:02:15  <stackedsax> which answers a couple of my questions about how selenium is working
2011-09-30T02:02:58  <stackedsax> at least it's copying out my custom profile to temporary profiles and it must be starting firefox with -no-remote for that to work.  So what I was figuring the code was dong is true
2011-09-30T02:04:01  <darius_w> how do you kill the browser?
2011-09-30T02:04:12  <stackedsax> the question remains, why exactly does "FirefoxChromeLauncher$FileLockRemainedException: Lock file still present!" get thrown
2011-09-30T02:04:29  <stackedsax> I'll check

2011-09-30T02:12:05  <stackedsax> it's a selenium method, not mine
2011-09-30T02:12:13  <Ajay> Stuk: Cool , will be working for it
2011-09-30T02:12:32  <darius_w> stackedsax: is there method stop() ?
2011-09-30T02:14:01  <stackedsax> yeah, the .quit() is for webdriver, I think.  non-webdriver is:
2011-09-30T02:14:02  <stackedsax>                 server.stop();
2011-09-30T02:14:03  <stackedsax>                 server = null;
2011-09-30T02:14:50  <darius_w> citation: "At the end of the test, stop() should be called instead of the Driver's quit() method."

2011-09-30T09:47:25  <stackedsax> I was asking a q last night about close() and stop()
2011-09-30T09:47:40  <stackedsax> is it necessary/recommended to call close() before stop()?
2011-09-30T09:49:17  <stackedsax> it seems like stop() should do the trick, but given that I have race conditions reopening Firefox before the previous process has stopped and that barancev noted that some IE's preferred a close() beforehand, it seems that both are actually necessary.
2011-09-30T09:49:30  <lord1234> ...ur using SE1?

2011-09-30T11:21:24  <adamgoucher> not really. more of a gentle shooting down.
2011-09-30T11:21:37  <lord1234> ZinovaS: selenium no longer supports php webdriver, as such, you wil have problems probably
2011-09-30T11:21:58  <adamgoucher> there was never 'official' support for webdriver in php
2011-09-30T11:22:00  <lord1234> when i saw the initial email adam, i was like "not going to happen"

2011-09-30T11:30:08  <kennethkoontz> Anyone familiar with handling ajax in selenium 2? I am testing a page that has an RTE field that I'd like to perform some asserts on. However, my problem is that the python test code will execute async with the ajax calls. One way of solving this would be to assert that the dom has changed. But I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way. Any ideas?

2011-09-30T11:48:26  <ZinovaS> WebDriver suports screenshots, i hope ;)
2011-09-30T11:49:17  <stackedsax> I think that depends on the driver, doesn't it?

2011-09-30T11:52:26  <ZinovaS> I was looking for /session/:sessionId/screenshot
