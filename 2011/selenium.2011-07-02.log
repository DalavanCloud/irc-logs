2011-07-02T06:34:28  <jarib> hi
2011-07-02T06:35:38  <urbanfbi> what is the current state of the selenium2 project and specially the state of the webdrivers?
2011-07-02T06:37:46  <urbanfbi> I'm thinking about using selenium2 in a project, since selenium(1) does not have support doing "real" mouse actions, we can't use it to test our applications. So the webdrivers of selenium2 seems to be very interesting
2011-07-02T06:45:12  <jarib> urbanfbi: the mouse stuff isn't fully supported cross-browser yet, i think firefox is the most complete
2011-07-02T06:45:49  <jarib> urbanfbi: you should just try out your specific case and see

2011-07-02T08:50:34  <jarib> hi there
2011-07-02T08:50:54  <simonstewart> Hi jarib
2011-07-02T08:51:09  <simonstewart> I've been spending today slowly sorting out various issues
2011-07-02T08:51:27  <simonstewart> Just running some final tests, and then I may be ready to roll in patches supplied in bug reports
2011-07-02T08:51:44  <jarib> nice
2011-07-02T08:51:49  <simonstewart> Taking things quite slowly cos I only got off the plane this morning and haven't had a huge amount of sleep
2011-07-02T08:51:54  <simonstewart> What did I miss last week?
2011-07-02T08:53:11  <simonstewart> Hmmm... I've yet to be convinced that ignoring stale element exceptions is a Smart Thing to do
2011-07-02T08:53:13  <jarib> nothing you can't glean from the commit log :)
2011-07-02T08:53:28  <simonstewart> Lummee, but it's been busy
2011-07-02T08:53:44  <simonstewart> What do you reckon our chances are of being able to get 2.0 out on Monday?

2011-07-02T08:55:43  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-07-02T08:56:21  <jarib> good question
2011-07-02T08:56:44  <jarib> depends on what we want to be in place for 2.0
2011-07-02T08:57:07  <simonstewart> native events for firefox 5
2011-07-02T08:57:17  <jarib> oh, eran's close
2011-07-02T08:57:20  <simonstewart> no blocking bugs for people upgrading from 1.0.3
2011-07-02T08:57:41  <jarib> but it involves downloading more SDKs as part of the build
2011-07-02T08:57:51  <jarib> he had some crazyfun dependency issue we couldn't figure out
2011-07-02T08:57:52  *** miker2 has joined #selenium
2011-07-02T08:58:00  <simonstewart> *shrugs* we already appear to be downloading a billion things
2011-07-02T08:58:00  <jarib> but it's all on his machine i think
2011-07-02T08:58:04  <simonstewart> what's the problem?
2011-07-02T08:58:34  <jarib> one sec
2011-07-02T08:59:34  <jarib> http://pastebin.com/ZAeaxVas
2011-07-02T08:59:44  <jarib> he said the gecko_deps was being run *after* the original task
2011-07-02T09:00:51  <simonstewart> That may well be true
2011-07-02T09:01:06  <simonstewart> he's adding the gecko-sdk pieces as the final dependency
2011-07-02T09:01:13  <simonstewart> he probably wants it to be the first
2011-07-02T09:01:24  <jarib> aha
2011-07-02T09:01:28  <simonstewart> :)
2011-07-02T09:04:31  <simonstewart> hmph! Something's kicking off too many builds
2011-07-02T09:04:35  <simonstewart> Not impressed
2011-07-02T09:06:50  <jarib> simonstewart: one question; what made you ditch the Keys.SINGLE_SELECT idea and modify click() instead?
2011-07-02T09:07:13  <simonstewart> Speed and the path of least resistance
2011-07-02T09:07:16  <jarib> click() is basically control-click now for this special case
2011-07-02T09:07:20  <simonstewart> Which isn't a great reason
2011-07-02T09:07:23  <simonstewart> right
2011-07-02T09:08:49  <jarib> as a user i'd be pretty frustrated if the click() semantics were to change back again
2011-07-02T09:09:02  <jarib> ditto for relative vs absolute urls from href/src
2011-07-02T09:09:44  <simonstewart> Right
2011-07-02T09:10:07  <simonstewart> I think Monday will be an interesting time to be on the irc channel
2011-07-02T09:10:15  <jarib> hehe
2011-07-02T09:11:12  <simonstewart> If we can get IE to return a partial URL then I'm happy to revert the change
2011-07-02T09:11:14  *** stepheneb has joined #selenium
2011-07-02T09:11:23  <simonstewart> But we really do need consistent behaviour between the browsers
2011-07-02T09:13:29  <jarib> i agree with that
2011-07-02T09:14:03  <simonstewart> We can always make WebElement.click Do The Right Thing, but the interactions ClickAction to the proper thing
2011-07-02T09:14:22  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-07-02T09:14:37  <jarib> yep
2011-07-02T09:15:16  <simonstewart> Because the sort of person who calls "element.click" is just doing what they'd do in a test, whereas someone using the interactions api is being a lot pickier about details

2011-07-02T10:13:54  <simonstewart> Good point. Well made
2011-07-02T10:14:59  <jarib> i also think the current template encourages people to describe their code rather than actually show it
2011-07-02T10:16:13  <jarib> perhaps someone with better english than me could improve it :)

2011-07-02T10:34:21  <freynaud> damn, 1 day earlier and it would have been ok
2011-07-02T10:34:24  <freynaud> bad timing
2011-07-02T10:34:28  <simonstewart> ha
2011-07-02T10:34:39  <simonstewart> On the plus side, I'm getting to run an awful lot of tests
2011-07-02T10:34:56  <simonstewart> and am being reminded that the chrome driver is incredibly fast
2011-07-02T10:35:44  <freynaud> I'm debugging my tests after refactoring the config part. crazy how much I broke
2011-07-02T10:36:12  <freynaud> Chrome has some problems though. I did a demo last week, and I had to workaround getText() exploding on me
2011-07-02T10:36:25  <simonstewart> Ouch

2011-07-02T10:38:00  <freynaud> about atoms
2011-07-02T10:38:02  <jarib> of course we'd pushed all the early chromedriver adopters to the dev channel.
2011-07-02T10:38:19  <simonstewart> *sigh*
2011-07-02T10:38:22  <freynaud> I only started with them last week,  and I was looking for something to detect a page loading event
2011-07-02T10:38:23  <jarib> 13 should be fine with the currently released driver
2011-07-02T10:38:24  <simonstewart> It'll get back to normal one day

2011-07-02T10:51:45  <simonstewart> It's less than ideal, but once we go 2.0 I want our builds to be green
2011-07-02T10:51:55  <simonstewart> And the chrome tests are dependent on the chromedriver update schedule
2011-07-02T10:52:05  <simonstewart> which is decoupled from the normal selenium updates
2011-07-02T10:52:46  <simonstewart> Now on to Opera
2011-07-02T10:52:47  <jarib> btw, chromedriver is being built by the chromium buildbots
2011-07-02T10:53:02  <jarib> not suggesting we should point users there, but good to know
2011-07-02T10:53:05  <jarib> e.g. http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/snapshots/Mac/91424/chrome-mac.test/
2011-07-02T10:53:21  <simonstewart> should i grab the latest and greatest?
2011-07-02T10:53:25  <barancev|2> go test-rc is not green too
2011-07-02T10:53:32  <simonstewart> should be now
2011-07-02T10:53:37  <simonstewart> I've just spent the day sorting it out
2011-07-02T10:53:38  <jarib> latest and greates of what?
2011-07-02T10:53:46  <simonstewart> chromedriver binary
2011-07-02T10:54:05  <jarib> i tried it with the ruby tests today, got a SIGBUS
2011-07-02T10:55:25  <simonstewart> ouch
2011-07-02T10:56:00  <simonstewart> Oof. Opera just locked up
2011-07-02T10:56:01  <jarib> i'm running a random chromium build though.
2011-07-02T10:56:20  <jarib> i updated the opera driver per ato's request the other day
2011-07-02T10:56:30  <jarib> the previous jar didn't seem to pass tests either
2011-07-02T10:56:33  <simonstewart> i saw that
2011-07-02T10:56:57  <jarib> if it's supposed to, feel free to revert that
2011-07-02T10:57:34  <simonstewart> No, we should be on tip-of-tree
2011-07-02T10:58:32  <jarib> simonstewart: would be nice if we could get a list of test names + corresponding @Ignores
2011-07-02T10:58:49  <jarib> i.e. make a page with a list of tests per driver
2011-07-02T10:58:52  <simonstewart> Run the tests with "log=true"
2011-07-02T10:59:29  <jarib> will that get me the list for all browsers?
2011-07-02T10:59:29  <simonstewart> If The Wife stays away a little longer, I'll have a look at moving us to junit 4
2011-07-02T10:59:34  <simonstewart> Nope
2011-07-02T10:59:49  <simonstewart> But once we're on 4 then we can use bamboo to get that information for us
2011-07-02T10:59:50  <jarib> perhaps it's possible to write a custom test runner that just prints the name + annotation
2011-07-02T10:59:55  <simonstewart> Right
2011-07-02T11:00:17  <jarib> just too bad native events/platform stuff isn't covered by @Ignore
2011-07-02T11:00:21  <simonstewart> Well played Opera: Tests run: 533, Failures: 4, Errors: 37, Time elapsed: 98.947 sec
2011-07-02T11:00:21  <jarib> that would be nice to have in that list too

2011-07-02T11:00:45  <jarib> the early return from tests is a bit nasty
2011-07-02T11:00:51  <simonstewart> It's a doddle to hook this stuff up
2011-07-02T11:01:24  <ato> I have to look into why it's taking so long to run the tests, I think we may have a performance issue on Desktop that's not present in our internal core builds.
2011-07-02T11:01:33  <jarib> it's hard for me to know what works where sometimes, and even more so for users
2011-07-02T11:01:40  <ato> Unfortunately it takes forever to get fixes in core out to the public, though.

2011-07-02T11:01:54  <simonstewart> A minute and a half for a full test run is pretty fast

2011-07-02T11:02:44  <ato> jarib: +1

2011-07-02T11:05:08  <simonstewart> ato: looks like the i18n tests are failing with opera desktop
2011-07-02T11:05:24  <jarib> so you think it's possible to get rid of the early returns checking for native events etc, and move that to @Ignores?
2011-07-02T11:05:44  <simonstewart> A custom annotation
2011-07-02T11:05:49  <simonstewart> and away we go

2011-07-02T11:08:29  <simonstewart> Wow. The typing tests are failing too
2011-07-02T11:08:32  <simonstewart> That can't be right
2011-07-02T11:08:40  <simonstewart> Does Opera expect focus when running the tests?

2011-07-02T11:28:41  <barancev|2> v1-emulation test suite is reduced, it contains only 36 tests, whle rc has 78 tests

2011-07-02T11:29:38  <simonstewart> right.
2011-07-02T11:29:43  <simonstewart> that's because we don't emulate everything

2011-07-02T16:22:38  <nirvdrum> Otherwise, local native browser launchers are used.  It's a lot easier to get started when running browsers locally.
