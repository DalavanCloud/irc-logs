2011-05-17T01:08:07  <Zladivliba> hi everyone !
2011-05-17T01:08:42  <Zladivliba> I'm having a bit of troubles working with selenium and asyncronous javascript widgets that are loading
2011-05-17T01:09:25  <Zladivliba> I tried : $this->selenium->waitForCondition($this->selenium->isTextPresent("my text")); which is supposed to wait for a javascript widget to load but this fails everytime (selenium doesn't wait for anything actually)
2011-05-17T01:09:33  <Zladivliba> any idea how I could solve this ?

2011-05-17T02:35:02  <damienka> Can anyone point me to a good reference on site flow testing or conventions on such like 'PageObject' for flows?
2011-05-17T02:35:10  <lisak> clicking, or moving to it and clicking doesn't seem to work with neither chrome nor firefox driver
2011-05-17T02:35:24  <simonstewart> lisak: you won't be able to click on a flash movie
2011-05-17T02:35:39  <simonstewart> you need to integrate with something like flexpilot as well

2011-05-17T02:53:14  <damienka> simonstewart: The main issues I am trying to address is the brittle nature of page objects in light of no id / name / convention.
2011-05-17T02:53:41  <simonstewart> You mean where the dev team don't add hooks to make things easy to test?
2011-05-17T03:04:02  <AutomatedTester> damienka: thats not brittle page objects, thats your dev team being lazy or hating you
2011-05-17T03:08:30  <Ivog> simonstewart: hi simon,  i was trying to find out where enablenativeevents should be set on true when its not specified. It seems a new sessionreq is sent and after that the desired capabilities are retrieved which contains enablenativeevents=false. So it seems to be going wrong within the ffdriver internals...?
2011-05-17T03:08:41  <damienka> simonstewart / AutomatedTester: yes, it's not pretty. I have some ideas going forward.

2011-05-17T03:34:53  <dereke> just sending my usual profile settings - sorry using remote driver - proxy config etc, and when I check them in firefox they have not been set

2011-05-17T03:38:32  <Ivog> dereke: its a bug in the latest firefoxprofile.java version
2011-05-17T03:39:06  <Ivog> If u revert firefoxprofile.java 1 version and build it will work again
2011-05-17T03:39:25  <dereke> oh ok, do you know if someone is working on a fix?

2011-05-17T06:05:38  <simonstewart> Also, I'm happy to accept patches
2011-05-17T06:05:39  <AutomatedTester> we instantiate a class that should never be instantiated
2011-05-17T06:05:41  <simonstewart> Or a rewrite :)
2011-05-17T06:05:46  <simonstewart> Do we? Nice
2011-05-17T06:05:55  <simonstewart> Also, jolly clever.
2011-05-17T06:05:59  <simonstewart> How'd we do that?
2011-05-17T06:06:22  <RossPatterson> Classes that shouldn't be instantiated should not be instantiable.
2011-05-17T06:06:31  <RossPatterson> :-)
2011-05-17T06:06:39  <simonstewart> My point exactly
2011-05-17T06:06:41  <AutomatedTester> well we can instantiate it but there is no need
2011-05-17T06:06:51  <RossPatterson> (Absent Reflection, of course)
2011-05-17T06:07:11  <AutomatedTester> so in server.js we get "handle is undefined" error with the following line
2011-05-17T06:07:14  <AutomatedTester> handle = Components.classes["@googlecode.com/webdriver/fxdriver;1"].createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsISupports);
2011-05-17T06:07:32  <simonstewart> ohhh... oooollld code
2011-05-17T06:07:33  <AutomatedTester> but since its defining the variable its not very helpful
2011-05-17T06:07:37  <simonstewart> Patch?
2011-05-17T06:07:57  <AutomatedTester> well I wanna understand what its doing since I never worked in this area

2011-05-17T06:08:34  <simonstewart> several long moments please, caller
2011-05-17T06:08:48  <AutomatedTester> the create instance apparently doesnt need an argument, its superfluous since everything derives from nsISupport apparently

2011-05-17T06:10:04  <simonstewart> So
2011-05-17T06:10:10  <simonstewart> We want to create an instance of the component
2011-05-17T06:10:17  <simonstewart> But we don't actually implement any interfaces
2011-05-17T06:10:21  <simonstewart> other than nsISupports
2011-05-17T06:10:36  <simonstewart> new  Components.classes["@googlecode.com/webdriver/fxdriver;1"]()
2011-05-17T06:10:40  <simonstewart> feels wrong

2011-05-17T06:13:26  <AutomatedTester> beware stupid questions are down this path... :)
2011-05-17T06:13:33  <simonstewart> Go for it
2011-05-17T06:14:06  <AutomatedTester> @googlecode.com/webdriver/fxdriver;1 refers to which exact object?
2011-05-17T06:14:54  <simonstewart> According to the chrome.manifest:

2011-05-17T06:17:10  <AutomatedTester> i dont learn from hand holding unfortunately
2011-05-17T06:17:16  <simonstewart> no worries
2011-05-17T06:17:45  <AutomatedTester> plus I hate how you explain stuff, it makes sense and then look at the code and still confused :P
2011-05-17T06:17:52  <simonstewart> lol

2011-05-17T09:24:00  <ivog> simonstewart: about the nativeevents, so what im seeing when debugging is that the newsessionrequest payload doesn't contain anything about nativeevents, but the response which comes back has nativeevents set to false
2011-05-17T09:26:13  <simonstewart> The browser sends back its state
2011-05-17T09:26:21  <simonstewart> So that's to be expected

2011-05-17T10:12:49  <seleniumuser> Thanks
2011-05-17T10:13:09  <seleniumuser> I get an error whenever DefaultSelenium.open is invoked.

2011-05-17T10:13:31  <simonstewart> Can you post a gist of how you're starting things up?
2011-05-17T10:14:05  <seleniumuser> This issue happens only when it runs as part of an automated build on hudson though. Can't reproduce when I try locally
2011-05-17T10:14:25  <simonstewart> OK. But how are you starting the selenium instance?
2011-05-17T10:14:52  *** erwan_ has joined #selenium
2011-05-17T10:15:12  <simonstewart> And are you seeing the failure at the start or end of your tests?
2011-05-17T10:15:19  <simonstewart> (I'm guessing start, but I've been wrong before :)
2011-05-17T10:15:42  <seleniumuser> I use the FirefoxDriver
2011-05-17T10:15:53  <seleniumuser> let me give you a gist
2011-05-17T10:16:06  *** barancev|2 has quit IRC
2011-05-17T10:16:31  <seleniumuser> does happen at the start of the test
2011-05-17T10:16:38  <simonstewart> Thanks
2011-05-17T10:17:24  <seleniumuser> we use a jetty server which starts up first
2011-05-17T10:20:06  <seleniumuser> we don't use the SeleniumServer, just the Selenium RC 2.0b3
2011-05-17T10:20:22  <seleniumuser> should I paste a detailed stack trace?
2011-05-17T10:20:38  <simonstewart> I'd love to see the gist of how you're creating your selenium instance
2011-05-17T10:20:46  <simonstewart> But a stacktrace would also be useful
2011-05-17T10:22:02  *** ivog has quit IRC
2011-05-17T10:22:36  <seleniumuser> We create a bean with class WebDriverBackedSelenium in the Spring context XML and then use the Selenium interface in the test class to open the required page.
2011-05-17T10:22:50  <simonstewart> Do you call "start"?
2011-05-17T10:22:58  <seleniumuser> nope
2011-05-17T10:23:09  <seleniumuser> When we used the SeleniumServer, we used to call start
2011-05-17T10:23:16  <seleniumuser> not now
2011-05-17T10:23:21  <seleniumuser> we do call "stop" after the suite
2011-05-17T10:23:56  <simonstewart> Ahhhh....
2011-05-17T10:24:04  <simonstewart> If you do that, you need to call start in the next test
2011-05-17T10:24:28  <seleniumuser> but then i stop after suite and not after test
2011-05-17T10:24:35  <simonstewart> Interesting
2011-05-17T10:24:44  <simonstewart> K. That stacktrace might be useful....
2011-05-17T10:24:46  <seleniumuser> respond.session.getWindow() is null System info: os.name: 'Linux', os.arch: 'amd64', os.version: '2.6.18-128.7.1.el5', java.version: '1.6.0_14' Driver info: driver.version: RemoteWebDriver org.openqa.selenium.internal.seleniumemulation.SeleneseCommand.apply(SeleneseCommand.java:41) at org.openqa.selenium.internal.seleniumemulation.Timer.run(Timer.java:61) at org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverCommandProcessor.execute(WebDriverCommand
2011-05-17T10:25:17  <simonstewart> Ahhh...
2011-05-17T10:25:24  <simonstewart> So this looks like something has happened in Firefox
2011-05-17T10:25:33  <simonstewart> The firefox window is still open, right?
2011-05-17T10:26:16  <seleniumuser> since this is on a hudson linux machine, I really can't see the browser.
2011-05-17T10:26:28  <simonstewart> Are you using Firefox 4?
2011-05-17T10:26:31  <seleniumuser> yes
2011-05-17T10:26:37  <simonstewart> 4.0.1?
2011-05-17T10:26:52  <seleniumuser> oh is there a difference in the behavior b/w 4 and 4.0.1 ?
2011-05-17T10:27:00  <simonstewart> Well, latest is always best to use
2011-05-17T10:27:04  <seleniumuser> I need to check if it is 4.0.1
2011-05-17T10:27:08  <simonstewart> But I suspect that you're being bitten by a race.
2011-05-17T10:27:20  <simonstewart> If you downgrade to 3.6.17, things might be more stable
2011-05-17T10:27:36  <eghm> isn't there a headless driver too?
2011-05-17T10:27:49  <seleniumuser> we need to test it on firefox

2011-05-17T11:05:07  <QAguy> Not quite sure I understand. You seem to be rescuing the error. That should be sufficient to not have it displayed.

2011-05-17T14:28:26  <andytinkham> I've got a CSS selector question. I've got the HTML here: https://gist.github.com/977452. I'd like to come up with a CSS selector to find the radio button (the first input element). When I'm searching, I only have the visit number (in the example, 1151313), not the visit id (in the example, 895561). I can't seem to find a way to first find the visit number then go backwards.  I have an XPath that works, if that would help
2011-05-17T14:30:03  <jimevans> I get a 404 trying to navigate to the gist, but my understanding is that css selectors have no concept of a "parent" element.
2011-05-17T14:30:33  <jimevans> then again, i don't know css selectors that well, and i've not yet seen the HTML, so i may talking out of turn.
2011-05-17T14:30:38  <andytinkham> Hmmm, that's the url showing for the gist. Maybe you're getting the period?

2011-05-17T14:31:54  <andytinkham> From what I've seen, CSS has enough of a concept of parent that I can start with the first td and get the second (using the ~ or + operators), but I can't go from the second to the first

2011-05-17T14:32:48  <andytinkham> Why the visit number isn't the same as the visit id, I don't know. They're both unique to the visit. (and my life would be much easier if they just used the one)

2011-05-17T14:34:21  <jimevans> yeah, i know exactly how i'd do it with xpath.
2011-05-17T14:34:52  <jimevans> is there any mileage in just using javascript to get the element after you've found the second td?
2011-05-17T14:35:48  <jimevans> i mean, yeah, it costs another statement execution (so you're not getting the right element in the single find), but still...
2011-05-17T14:35:56  <andytinkham> I could easily be convinced to do that (though I don't know javascript yet)
2011-05-17T14:36:20  <andytinkham> I can't imagine the xpath version is very performant (though it wasn't noticeably all that slow either)
2011-05-17T14:36:39  <jimevans> well xpath isn't performant across browsers, that we already know. :)
2011-05-17T14:36:47  <andytinkham> Exactly :)
2011-05-17T14:37:06  <andytinkham> So, css to find the second td, and then Javascript to get the radio button?
2011-05-17T14:38:11  <jimevans> that, or find the label, which has the radio id as its "for" attribute, and do a second findElement for the radio button.
2011-05-17T14:39:13  <andytinkham> Oh yeah - that would work

2011-05-17T20:25:54  <johnnywengluu> why doesn't selenium have a http restful api
2011-05-17T20:26:20  <johnnywengluu> that would allow all languages to access it
2011-05-17T20:26:50  <johnnywengluu> and then different languages could wrap it up in language specific API
2011-05-17T20:27:06  <johnnywengluu> instead of today's API just for java, ruby and .Net
