2011-04-02T19:57:19  <Ravipriya> Hi, I want to do some testing work with firefox(not web-application testing).
2011-04-02T19:57:23  <Ravipriya> I want some automatic mechanism that will do following things
2011-04-02T19:57:30  <Ravipriya> 1.it have to gets started when firefox opens.
2011-04-02T19:57:45  <Ravipriya> 2.It have to execute sequence of tasks(go to some sites, logging in and logging out, etc)
2011-04-02T19:57:53  <Ravipriya> 3. close firefox when the sequence of task is completed
2011-04-02T19:58:50  <Ravipriya> these things have to be done automatically. Is it possible to do this with selinium?
2011-04-02T20:00:20  <Ravipriya> I tried selenium IDE and I successfully could do 2nd step. But I was unable to start the test automatically as firefox opens and exit firefox when the test finish
2011-04-02T20:02:27  <Ravipriya> I tried 'close' command in selenium. It closes browser window. But it leaves Selenium IDE opens. So firefox process doesn't get kills. I want to kill that as well
2011-04-02T20:03:54  <Ravipriya> can any one help me please
