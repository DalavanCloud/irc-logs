2011-02-16T03:00:01  <jarib> hmm
2011-02-16T03:00:10  <jarib> ok, that looks sane according to the wire protocol
2011-02-16T03:00:38  <jarib> the ruby bindings have it as 21 for some reason
2011-02-16T03:01:08  <jarib> probably something left over from the old IE driver..
2011-02-16T03:01:29  <jarib> i guess i'll make both 21 and 28 be TimeOutError on the Ruby side

2011-02-16T03:29:12  <AutomatedTester> I dont have 21
2011-02-16T03:29:22  <jarib> i noticed jleyba have a TODO in ErrorCodes.java about cleaning things up
2011-02-16T03:29:32  <jarib> i'm sure it's from the old IE driver
2011-02-16T03:29:58  <jarib> i'll wait for the cleanup before touching it again

2011-02-16T03:30:29  <jarib> simonstewart: i bcced you on an email to the capybara list (about attachFile for Se2)
2011-02-16T03:30:32  <AutomatedTester> jarib: atm I am taking the approach that nothing is breaking because of it not being there so leave well alone
2011-02-16T03:30:38  <jarib> sauce user wanting to switch.
2011-02-16T03:30:50  <jarib> AutomatedTester: makes sense
2011-02-16T03:33:16  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: I would if I could get out of the office more
2011-02-16T03:33:19  <simonstewart> late again
2011-02-16T03:33:37  <simonstewart> Heh. file uploads
2011-02-16T03:33:50  <simonstewart> I've written and deleted that patch about 3 times now
2011-02-16T03:34:55  <jarib> i must say your reluctance to add a new method for this is admirable
2011-02-16T03:35:14  <simonstewart> It's pretty easy to do
2011-02-16T03:35:26  <simonstewart> Just sniff the value to see if it's a file, and voila
2011-02-16T03:35:48  <simonstewart> Perhaps making the upload optional for certain drivers
2011-02-16T03:36:00  <simonstewart> (that is, only make the really remote drivers actually copy files around)
2011-02-16T03:37:48  <jarib> so if it's easy, why was the patch deleted 3 times? :)
2011-02-16T03:37:58  <simonstewart> because I want to make it nice
2011-02-16T03:38:01  <simonstewart> :)
2011-02-16T03:38:09  <simonstewart> and because i keep on nuking my svn repo
2011-02-16T03:38:42  <jarib> sounds like someone could use a VCS with cheap branching... ;)
2011-02-16T03:39:01  <simonstewart> sounds like someone who needs to be a less itchy with his "rm -rf" trigger finger
2011-02-16T03:42:34  <jarib> so: (1) user calls sendKeys("foo"); (2) if "foo" is a file on disk; read and encode as base64, then pass that along through the sendKeys command; (3) remote driver sees the base64 string and writes it to disk, and (4) sends it to the browser
2011-02-16T03:42:53  <simonstewart> right
2011-02-16T03:42:56  <jarib> s/sends it/sends the path/
2011-02-16T03:42:57  <simonstewart> you need to preserve the file name
2011-02-16T03:43:03  <simonstewart> yeah
2011-02-16T03:43:08  <jarib> what's not nice about?
2011-02-16T03:43:11  <simonstewart> but you want the upload to be optional
2011-02-16T03:43:22  <simonstewart> The firefox driver lives with a tiny stack
2011-02-16T03:43:34  <simonstewart> If you upload a file into it, you'll cause it to run out of memory
2011-02-16T03:43:38  <simonstewart> (boo)
2011-02-16T03:43:55  <jarib> would it help to have a separate command in the REST API (but not exposed to the user)?
2011-02-16T03:43:55  <simonstewart> And encoding, copying and decoding files isn't particularly efficient
2011-02-16T03:44:16  <simonstewart> It's an option
2011-02-16T03:44:30  <simonstewart> Though I'm not sure of how much of an option it really is

2011-02-16T03:44:52  <simonstewart> the main thing you want to check is "am I on the same machine as the browser?"
2011-02-16T03:45:33  <jarib> wouldn't "did the client connect from my ip" work?
2011-02-16T03:45:59  <simonstewart> wrong way round
2011-02-16T03:46:06  <simonstewart> "Is the server on a different ip"
2011-02-16T03:46:13  <AutomatedTester> yay, just realised my python bindings were 1 feature ahead of Ruby
2011-02-16T03:46:23  <simonstewart> But even that's not enough

2011-02-16T03:48:12  <simonstewart> I've seen it used
2011-02-16T03:48:28  <jarib> the docs inject an XHR

2011-02-16T03:49:26  <simonstewart> In this case, as an example
2011-02-16T03:49:40  <simonstewart> but you can imagine loading test data into an ajax site that way
2011-02-16T03:49:58  <jarib> ah, with a server controlled by the test?

2011-02-16T04:46:31  <jarib> (the ruby tests, obviously)

2011-02-16T05:55:42  <jgarvin> Can any one tell me by what means Selenium tests trigger the page load is complete ie "newPageLoaded" flag?  Is it DOM based (i.e.document.ready()) or network based?

2011-02-16T06:04:55  <jarib> ok?
2011-02-16T06:04:56  <dereke> get an error when trying to clean up the tmpdir on jruby - https://gist.github.com/829416
2011-02-16T06:05:33  <jarib> hmpf. the . looks suspicious
2011-02-16T06:06:37  <dereke> yeah. it seems like a permission thing, but then I just tried FileUtils.rm_r instead and it CAN delete that directory..
2011-02-16T06:07:06  <jarib> sounds like Dir.mktmpdir bug in JRuby
2011-02-16T06:07:31  <jarib> not sure why mktmpdir is trying to delete files though..
2011-02-16T06:08:26  *** Snekatis has joined #selenium
2011-02-16T06:09:16  <dereke> because you can pass it a block which deletes the tmp dir afterwards

2011-02-16T06:46:29  <jarib> simonstewart: some days ago we talked about exposing X-backed-X in the remote server
2011-02-16T06:46:52  <jarib> X-backed-Y
2011-02-16T06:47:00  <simonstewart> Yeah
2011-02-16T06:47:03  <simonstewart> I backed off that
2011-02-16T06:47:19  <simonstewart> It seemed like a good idea
2011-02-16T06:47:26  <simonstewart> at the time
2011-02-16T06:47:31  <jarib> yes. since that means people wouldn't be able to switch between X and Y in their tests
2011-02-16T06:47:37  <simonstewart> We might be able to do it with the new Grid stuff
2011-02-16T06:47:42  <simonstewart> right
2011-02-16T06:47:51  <jarib> but wouldn't it be possible to expose both on the server, for the same browser

2011-02-16T06:49:09  <simonstewart> Well, technically it's possible
2011-02-16T06:49:22  <simonstewart> Is it worth the time to implement?
2011-02-16T06:49:42  <jarib> that's the question.

2011-02-16T06:53:39  <jarib> but if there's a future demand, doing it on the server seems a lot more sane than porting it to each binding
2011-02-16T06:53:49  <simonstewart> right
2011-02-16T06:53:49  <jarib> esp. since Se1 people are used to dealing with the server anyway.
2011-02-16T06:53:53  <AutomatedTester> should the iPhoneDriver be called the iOSSafariDriver?

2011-02-16T06:56:34  <simonstewart> ohhhh....
2011-02-16T06:56:39  <simonstewart> what's the problem?

2011-02-16T06:58:05  <jimevans> on line 85 of BrowserFactory.cpp, we're calling document->getParentWindow()

2011-02-16T07:11:58  <jimevans> i can't imagine the ffi library being the cause, but i'm at a loss as to where these problems are occuring.
2011-02-16T07:12:05  <jarib> i just thought about that
2011-02-16T07:12:10  <davehunt> okay, invitations sent

2011-02-16T07:12:44  <jarib> jimevans: ruby from rubyinstaller is compiled with mingw, not VS - perhaps that could be an issue?
2011-02-16T07:12:51  <davehunt> simonstewart: It might actually be earlier due to daylight savings...

2011-02-16T07:13:47  <jimevans> jarib: hmm... there's a thought. i can't imagine it being the cause, but i'm not ready to rule anythint out at this point.
2011-02-16T07:13:49  <AutomatedTester> then hide in a corner
2011-02-16T07:14:40  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: you should get Matt to bring over the Mozilla Google badges

2011-02-16T07:36:39  <jarib> adamgoucher: one thing i've thought about doing is writing a Bridge that wraps the java driver on JRuby
2011-02-16T07:36:55  <jarib> that would give ruby users access to htmlunit and operadriver on jruby
2011-02-16T07:37:37  <ato> (Yes, please.)
2011-02-16T07:37:42  <jarib> and would also ease work on watir-webdriver and operawatir
2011-02-16T07:37:44  <jimevans> jarib: how does the operawatir implementation work? is there a ruby operadriver implementation underneath it?
2011-02-16T07:37:54  <jarib> jimevans: it runs on JRuby only
2011-02-16T07:37:57  <ato> jimevans: One written in Java.

2011-02-16T07:38:30  <jimevans> i was hoping the opera guys would have implemented a ruby driver in addition to a java one.

2011-02-16T07:38:41  <jimevans> ato: i've seen the operadriver code.
2011-02-16T07:39:24  <ato> We're using OperaDriver to run other kinds of tests as well, such as JavaScript and visual tests.  So it didn't really make sense to write it in Ruby.
2011-02-16T07:40:01  <ato> Well, unless we had decided to do everything on Ruby, of course.
2011-02-16T07:40:18  <simonstewart> ato: I take it you know about the long term plan for webdrier?
2011-02-16T07:40:24  <jarib> the ideal solution would be if opera did the same as chrome

2011-02-16T07:42:26  <jarib> nirvdrum: turned out only one test depended on having a separate instance ^^
2011-02-16T07:43:00  <simonstewart> mattml: nope
2011-02-16T07:43:17  <simonstewart> Just cast your webdriver instance to JavascriptExecutor and execute the JS to return the value
2011-02-16T07:43:40  <simonstewart> something like: ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("return $foo");
2011-02-16T07:44:06  <jarib> "return $(selector).get(0)" if you don't want it to hang
2011-02-16T07:44:13  <jarib> jquery objects are recursive
2011-02-16T07:44:24  <jarib> so you can't return that

2011-02-16T07:50:53  <jarib> though ruby doesn't have a good mechanism for that

2011-02-16T07:56:56  <nirvdrum> You can try replacing the selenium-server-1.0.3-standalone.jar in the vendor/ directory with one that may work better.  But I don't ever use the Opera driver, so I'm not sure what version that would be.
2011-02-16T07:57:10  *** gnofi has joined #selenium
2011-02-16T07:57:31  <nirvdrum> Just note that if you do replace that JAR, it needs to have the same name in order to get loaded properly.
2011-02-16T07:57:49  <cqixk_work> Thank you nirvdrum - I'm still pretty new to Selenium. So a heavy start to start with grid...

2011-02-16T10:19:07  <lawcab> question about trying to get an image
2011-02-16T10:19:11  <lawcab> where it has no name or id
2011-02-16T10:19:17  <XCulver> hmm
2011-02-16T10:19:25  <lawcab> the only usable thing i think is src
2011-02-16T10:19:27  <XCulver> lawcab: selenium2 or 1?
2011-02-16T10:19:31  <lawcab> 2
2011-02-16T10:19:33  <XCulver> kk
2011-02-16T10:19:39  <XCulver> theres lots of options for selectors
2011-02-16T10:19:49  <lawcab> using webdriver
2011-02-16T10:19:49  <jqp> do the src values have any pattern?
2011-02-16T10:20:19  <lawcab> example is : /images/servlets/SignOn/createaccount.gif
2011-02-16T10:20:21  <XCulver> http://webdriver.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/org/openqa/selenium/By.html
2011-02-16T10:20:28  <XCulver> that will give you an idea what all is available
2011-02-16T10:20:41  <XCulver> but like jqp, what makes it unique?
2011-02-16T10:20:45  <XCulver> the text?
2011-02-16T10:21:03  <jqp> a css selector could be [src="/images/servlets/SignOn/createaccount.gif"]
2011-02-16T10:21:37  <XCulver> by.css("[src="/images/servlets/SignOn/createaccount.gif"]") i think
2011-02-16T10:21:41  <lawcab> the By does not have filename
2011-02-16T10:21:44  <XCulver> i havne't used a css selector in ages
2011-02-16T10:22:50  <lawcab> XCulver: I will try the css selector out

2011-02-16T10:23:19  <jqp> i'm looking to adopt a java-based testing framework that can integrate well with selenium -- which is the best?
2011-02-16T10:23:36  <jqp> junit, testng, ?
2011-02-16T10:24:07  <jimevans> jarib: suggested ruby version?
2011-02-16T10:24:20  <jarib> latest - 1.9.2
2011-02-16T10:24:23  <jimevans> thanks.
2011-02-16T10:24:35  *** mandric has quit IRC
2011-02-16T10:28:45  <lawcab> XCulver : the cssSelector worked
2011-02-16T10:28:52  <XCulver> woot!
2011-02-16T10:29:00  <lawcab> now my question is can I change it to be a regular expression
2011-02-16T10:29:18  <jgarvin> hi all
2011-02-16T10:29:23  <lawcab> so that I can just put createaccount.gif
2011-02-16T10:29:25  <jgarvin> Can anyone tell me by what means Selenium tests trigger the page load is complete ie "newPageLoaded" flag? Is it DOM based (i.e.document.ready()) or network based?
2011-02-16T10:29:34  <lawcab> instead of the whole css strring
2011-02-16T10:29:49  <XCulver> lawcab: I don't know about directly in the selector
2011-02-16T10:30:40  <lawcab> cause I have some elements i can see in the future
2011-02-16T10:30:51  <lawcab> we are testing multi language
2011-02-16T10:31:19  <lawcab> so I am forseeing that some of my elements I would have to do some kind of regex for defining my elements
2011-02-16T10:31:34  *** jledbetter has joined #selenium
2011-02-16T10:31:42  <XCulver> can you do it outside the selector?
2011-02-16T10:32:04  <XCulver> then submit that new generated css selector string into the by.css() ?
2011-02-16T10:32:27  <lawcab> so like to a regex first?
2011-02-16T10:32:30  <XCulver> but as far as using regex directly in css, i dont know
2011-02-16T10:32:35  <XCulver> lawcab: yah
2011-02-16T10:32:45  <lawcab> then pass that to the by
2011-02-16T10:32:50  <XCulver> exactly
2011-02-16T10:33:23  <lawcab> ok...thanks...will try that
2011-02-16T10:34:06  <XCulver> lawcab: quick google and i found http://webhole.net/2010/01/14/css-regular-expressions/
2011-02-16T10:34:36  <XCulver> so i would assume you can do what your thinking

2011-02-16T10:40:36  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: sorry was having supper
2011-02-16T10:40:52  <jimevans> no worries. just had a python bindings question.
2011-02-16T10:41:03  <AutomatedTester> shoot
2011-02-16T10:41:31  <jimevans> i'm really looking forward to the new Chrome driver and came across this wiki page: http://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/webdriver-for-chrome
2011-02-16T10:41:57  <jimevans> which would seem to indicate that there are some python integration tests for webdriver.
2011-02-16T10:42:30  <AutomatedTester> py/test/selenium/webdriver/common
2011-02-16T10:42:35  <jimevans> are there such a beast? if so, are those tests what are being used for the chromium project?
2011-02-16T10:42:40  <jimevans> i guess so
2011-02-16T10:42:47  <jimevans> wasn't fast enough on the question.
2011-02-16T10:43:11  <AutomatedTester> and then for each driver there is a module level setup that starts the browser and then gets the tests out of common
2011-02-16T10:43:36  <AutomatedTester> i took the java tests and ported them to python
2011-02-16T10:43:41  *** jqp has quit IRC
2011-02-16T10:43:58  <jimevans> ah. that answers the biggest part of my question then, was the extent of the testing done.
2011-02-16T10:44:22  <jarib> AutomatedTester: are they actually used by the chromedriver?
2011-02-16T10:44:23  <jimevans> and if the chromium project is using all of them, or just the tests that apply to what they've implemented so far.
2011-02-16T10:44:23  <jarib> http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/test/webdriver/
2011-02-16T10:44:38  <jarib> i see some .py tests here
2011-02-16T10:44:46  <AutomatedTester> jarib: there is a bug open to make chromium pass my tests
2011-02-16T10:45:11  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: the tests that are in py/test/selenium/webdriver/chrome
2011-02-16T10:45:16  <AutomatedTester> well those are the setups
2011-02-16T10:45:17  <jimevans> on the day that happens, i'll start working on the .NET chrome driver again.
2011-02-16T10:45:30  <jimevans> :)
2011-02-16T10:46:22  <jimevans> do you happen to have the chromium bug number for that? i just want to keep tabs on it... :)
2011-02-16T10:46:45  <jarib> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=71237
2011-02-16T10:46:48  * jimevans is champing at the bit to get a new Chrome driver integrated into the project.
2011-02-16T10:46:57  <AutomatedTester> thats the one
2011-02-16T10:47:03  <AutomatedTester> note my comment :)
2011-02-16T10:47:18  <AutomatedTester> so the typing tests arent enabled
2011-02-16T10:47:27  <AutomatedTester> because chrome is rubbish at typing
2011-02-16T10:48:04  <jimevans> i thought i saw something about pushing some functionality into webkit to help that along.
2011-02-16T10:48:11  <jimevans> then again, i'm not a chromium developer...
2011-02-16T10:48:53  <jarib> they don't have sendKeys or click implemented yet

2011-02-16T10:57:51  <jarib> jimevans: btw, if you're not building any java stuff, using rake instead of go should be a lot faster
2011-02-16T10:58:16  <jimevans> yeah, but the .NET tests depend on the Java web server.
2011-02-16T10:58:43  <jarib> right, but if it's already built once with ./go, you can use rake for everything else

2011-02-16T11:15:11  <jimevans> holy crap! it's alive!
2011-02-16T11:16:21  <jimevans> i'm actually building the .NET bindings without Visual Studio installed.
2011-02-16T11:16:32  <jarib> !
2011-02-16T11:16:39  <jarib> how?
2011-02-16T11:16:41  <jimevans> i know, right?
2011-02-16T11:17:01  <jimevans> when you install the .NET framework, you get the managed language compilers (csc.exe and vbc.exe).
2011-02-16T11:17:09  <jarib> aha
2011-02-16T11:17:13  <jimevans> our build script calls the compiler directly.
2011-02-16T11:17:18  <jarib> i assume this won't work for the IE driver
2011-02-16T11:17:36  <jimevans> no, not the unmanaged code parts. that's what we have prebuilts for. :)
2011-02-16T11:18:05  <jarib> that's true
2011-02-16T11:18:33  <jimevans> I do need to make a change to the "Visual Studio is installed" detection in the rake tasks, thought.

2011-02-16T12:47:18  <RossPatterson> fission6: No.  XPath counts from 1, not 0.
2011-02-16T12:47:38  <fission6> sel.select("(//div/select[@name='attribute'])[1]", "label=Revenue") this did not work either :(
2011-02-16T12:48:20  <RossPatterson> You probably need an "xpath=" before the "(".
2011-02-16T12:48:26  <fission6> ok ill try thank you
2011-02-16T12:48:41  <RossPatterson> Selenium will assume one if the locator starts with "//", but not with "(".
2011-02-16T12:48:44  <fission6> also is there a way to run selenium without showing the debug window, like i just want the browser to popup in fullscreen
2011-02-16T12:48:52  <RossPatterson> Not that I know of.
2011-02-16T12:50:37  <fission6> hm so you just run it as is with the two windows
2011-02-16T12:51:21  <selbot2> michael.tamm2 2011-02-16 20:56 MichaelTamm: Updated maven.html - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11469
2011-02-16T12:51:22  <RossPatterson> Well, yes, or you can run it in single-window mode, in which case the debug/banner stuff shows up at the top of the browser window.
2011-02-16T12:51:39  <RossPatterson> FYI, multi-framed applications may not behave well in single-window mode.
2011-02-16T12:52:26  <fission6> ok
2011-02-16T12:53:07  <RossPatterson> G'nite, all.

2011-02-16T13:53:39  <fission6> that would be very nice
2011-02-16T13:53:47  <fission6> any outlook on timelines?
2011-02-16T13:55:12  <AutomatedTester> by the end of the week
2011-02-16T13:57:09  <fission6> wow really?
2011-02-16T13:57:48  <fission6> not to be rude, believe me i am happy but why did it take so long for htmlunit support? ive been dying for it. again just curious what the high priorities have been
2011-02-16T13:58:00  <fission6> pydoc -w selenium.webdriver.firefox.webdriver is a cheap one liner for documentation - kind of
2011-02-16T13:58:29  <AutomatedTester> my priorities have been getting the python bindings up to scratch
2011-02-16T13:58:44  <AutomatedTester> dunno if you noticed but there hasnt been any work on it for a very long time
2011-02-16T13:58:54  <AutomatedTester> you can do htmlunit now
2011-02-16T13:59:00  <AutomatedTester> but its convoluted
2011-02-16T14:00:12  <AutomatedTester> fission6: i am going to make it a lot easier

2011-02-16T14:04:05  <fission6> is that to me
