2011-09-20T03:48:00  <simonstewart> yo
2011-09-20T03:48:05  <simonstewart> Going to have a play with the opera driver again today
2011-09-20T03:50:03  <andreastt> Let us know if you need any more fixes.
2011-09-20T03:50:41  *** andreashaas has joined #selenium
2011-09-20T03:50:48  <andreastt> BTW, with the release of Opera 12, test stability should increase quite a bit.
2011-09-20T03:51:01  <andreastt> Opera 11.51 has a few defects which will make it end up in a bad, non-recoverable state.
2011-09-20T03:51:09  <andreastt> (One example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7483686/can-not-drive-opera-with-watir-webdriver-on-mac-os-x-10-5)
2011-09-20T03:51:17  <simonstewart> Excellent.
2011-09-20T03:51:35  <simonstewart> Have you tried running the webdriver-backed selenium tests for the opera driver?
2011-09-20T03:51:48  <simonstewart> It's almost at the point where I can run the entire suite

2011-09-20T03:58:36  <simonstewart> thought you might find it interesting
2011-09-20T03:58:54  <simonstewart> It uncovers a few niggles, but once it passes, you're on very solid ground
2011-09-20T03:59:03  <andreastt> What is WebDrived-backed Selenium?
2011-09-20T03:59:09  <andreastt> Is it Selenium 1 API, backed by WebDriver API?
2011-09-20T03:59:11  <simonstewart> (window and frame switching appear to be the main problems)
2011-09-20T03:59:15  <simonstewart> That's it exactly
2011-09-20T03:59:38  <simonstewart> http://seleniumhq.org/docs/appendix_migrating_from_rc_to_webdriver.html
2011-09-20T03:59:48  <simonstewart> It's a key part of the migration strategy listed there
2011-09-20T04:00:12  <simonstewart> Ironically, with the webdriver-backed selenium selenium rc could well have better opera support than before
2011-09-20T04:00:26  <krosenvold> simonstewart: Would you think r13876 leaks memory ?
2011-09-20T04:00:28  <selbot2> kristian.rosenvold@gmail.com about 14 hours ago - KristianRosenvold: Issue2456 - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=13876
2011-09-20T04:00:49  <krosenvold> I suppose the question is; is it too much ?
2011-09-20T04:01:15  <simonstewart> It will leak memory as we never remove the listener
2011-09-20T04:01:39  <simonstewart> Why not detach the listener while setting active to false?
2011-09-20T04:01:51  <krosenvold> Because there may be other listeners and they dont get run

2011-09-20T04:02:25  <krosenvold> FFS WTF ?
2011-09-20T04:02:46  <krosenvold> Correction; there is at least one case where they dont get run
2011-09-20T04:02:52  <simonstewart> You can use bot.userAgent.isVersion() to detect the version of firefox being used
2011-09-20T04:02:52  <simonstewart> FFS == "bloody firefox 3. I wonder when I can stop supporting it"
2011-09-20T04:03:18  <krosenvold> Cool. Or I could just add one listener per client-type
2011-09-20T04:03:31  <simonstewart> "client-type"?
2011-09-20T04:03:35  <krosenvold> i.e. let "click" have it's one singleton instance

2011-09-20T05:02:54  <Stuk> they provide extra information, but when you strip out the extensions they are completely compatible

2011-09-20T05:17:01  <andreastt> It might be that we compiled from the tarball.

2011-09-20T05:27:08  <jimevans> something's picking up an implementation that it shouldn't, and i'm still clueless enough when it comes to java that i can't easily diagnose how to fix it.

2011-09-20T06:29:56  <adamgoucher> is there /way/ too much magic in phpunit's se driver implementation. and by magic i also mean opinion (that contradicts my opinions :))

2011-09-20T06:37:32  <simonstewart> and at least one of the other PHP bindings is merging with that
2011-09-20T06:37:44  <adamgoucher> and has the advantage of being /just/ the driver. nothing else
2011-09-20T06:37:59  <adamgoucher> what worries me is that there are exactly zero tests in the repo

2011-09-20T06:38:03  <ian_mac2> all the webdriver ones are just the driver, no?

2011-09-20T06:52:01  <jimevans> yes, last week. i'm having a devil of a time tracking down what changed.
2011-09-20T06:52:28  <krosenvold> Is version control too progressive for this stuff ?
2011-09-20T06:52:43  <jimevans> oh, no. i've reverted all of my local changes.

2011-09-20T06:53:56  <krosenvold> Hmpf. so you're supposedly on exactly the same version that USED to work and it doesn't work anymore ?
2011-09-20T06:54:31  <jimevans> in theory. i'm not naive enough to claim it's *exactly* the same. something clearly changed, but i have no idea what.
2011-09-20T06:55:51  <krosenvold> Did you upgrade your maven version ?
2011-09-20T06:56:14  <krosenvold> Your stacktrace is not from the root. Can I see the full one ?
2011-09-20T06:56:21  <jimevans> not to my knowledge, but i'd have to check with the build guys.
2011-09-20T06:56:25  <jimevans> yeah, one second.
2011-09-20T06:56:48  <krosenvold> Are any of your plugins SNAPSHOT versions ?
2011-09-20T06:57:35  <jimevans> they shouldn't be.
2011-09-20T06:57:52  <jimevans> oh, and i lied about the full stack trace. you'll have to give me a little more time.
2011-09-20T06:57:54  <jimevans> but first, i've got to get my deployment working again, or i have no web application to run tests against.

2011-09-20T10:41:22  <mydog2> not really a sel question.. but an xpath issue with lower-case...
2011-09-20T10:41:26  <hugs> so far, so good
2011-09-20T10:41:36  <mydog2> any reason that this shouldn't work?? >> //span[(contains(lower-case(@id),'lblitemrequire')]
2011-09-20T10:41:52  <mydog2> seems to blowup on the "lower-case"
2011-09-20T10:42:02  <simonstewart> You don't need the "lower-case" in any case
2011-09-20T10:42:41  <mydog2> hey simonstewart  - basicall i want to take the value of the id and make it lowercase..
2011-09-20T10:42:59  <mydog2> is there a way to accomplish that?
2011-09-20T10:43:12  <simonstewart> No idea

2011-09-20T10:45:32  <RossPatterson> mydog2: ID attribute values in HTML are case-insensitive.  It shouldn't matter what case it's specified in the HTML or in your XPath.
2011-09-20T10:45:37  <mydog2> yeah.. that would get the same thing..
2011-09-20T10:46:24  <mydog2> hey RossPatterson  - checking in xpather/ff.. it does seem to matter..
2011-09-20T10:48:19  <simonstewart> I may well have to prepare some patches for the operadriver protos
2011-09-20T10:49:07  <RossPatterson> mydog2: It wouldn't be the first time Firefox has gotten HTML wrong. :-(
2011-09-20T10:49:50  <mydog2> i'm also trying libxml2dom in py to check..
2011-09-20T10:50:10  <simonstewart> OK. I have finished mucking around with the protocol buffer definitions
2011-09-20T10:50:17  <simonstewart> They have been ripped up a little bit
2011-09-20T10:50:23  <simonstewart> and there's scuff marks around the edges
2011-09-20T10:50:26  <simonstewart> Let's see if this works :)
2011-09-20T10:53:21  <simonstewart> Lesson learnt: a compiled class with protocol buffers needs to be used with the same version of the protobuf library that compiled it
2011-09-20T10:53:35  <simonstewart> The wire format is independent, the compiled form isn't
2011-09-20T10:53:42  <simonstewart> I now have some meat to work with

2011-09-20T10:54:24  <simonstewart> though, sadly, there's some problems with the protocol buffer definitions

2011-09-20T13:25:38  <andreastt> csanchez: BTW, I've seen your email, but it's really not easy to tell what's going wrong.
2011-09-20T13:26:05  <andreastt> csanchez: The Opera 12 release, which is just around the corner, will provide more stability when running tests in a grid.
2011-09-20T13:26:31  <andreastt> csanchez: In he mean time, I can recommend deleting the autotestmode profile from the Opera directory (on Windows) or ~/.autotestmode (on UNIX).
2011-09-20T13:26:54  <andreastt> If you're using a script to run the tests, I'd recommend doing that between each test run actually.
2011-09-20T13:27:18  <andreastt> Opera 12 will also support parallelized running of tests, much like Chrome and Firefox.

2011-09-20T13:50:12  <andreastt> santiycr: Okay, so basically, we operate with Core and Desktop builds of Opera.
2011-09-20T13:50:33  <andreastt> santiycr: I work in the Core department with testing, which means I've obviously focused more on the first than the latter.
2011-09-20T13:50:58  <andreastt> santiycr: But, we've been addressing the issues with the public Opera version as of late, and the fixes for your bug I think should be in Opera 12.
2011-09-20T13:51:09  <santiycr> I see
2011-09-20T13:51:19  <andreastt> santiycr: So in the mean time, deleting ~/.autotestmode between each run would be a workaround.
2011-09-20T13:51:35  <santiycr> andreastt any place I can pull a preview?
2011-09-20T13:52:01  <santiycr> andreastt: hm, it's strange though that we're not running more than one test per box
2011-09-20T13:52:15  <andreastt> You can parallelize with Opera 12.
2011-09-20T13:52:28  <santiycr> andreastt gotta go and check if the directory is there even before the failure
2011-09-20T13:52:30  <santiycr> let me confirm
2011-09-20T13:52:43  <santiycr> andreastt: that's pretty sweet
2011-09-20T13:52:48  <andreastt> http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/
2011-09-20T13:52:58  <andreastt> The latest snapshot from the Desktop people should work on GNU/Linux.
2011-09-20T13:53:18  <andreastt> I'll ask them if it's possible to release a snapshot for Windows and Mac tomorrow.
2011-09-20T13:54:01  *** ruel has joined #selenium
2011-09-20T13:54:08  <andreastt> So basically you have to set capabilities "opera.port" to 0 and "opera.profile" to null.
2011-09-20T13:54:21  <andreastt> Using that build, this will enable parallelization on GNU/Linux only.
2011-09-20T13:54:39  <andreastt> But we've been pushing the Desktop dept. quite hard to get it working on Windows/Mac.
2011-09-20T13:54:49  <andreastt> So the work on that was completed today, actually.
2011-09-20T13:54:49  <santiycr> got it
2011-09-20T13:54:53  <santiycr> that definitely helps
2011-09-20T13:55:20  <santiycr> I'd love to get Opera support out the door in Sauce within then next few weeks
2011-09-20T13:55:21  <andreastt> Once Opera 12 is released, we'll update OperaDriver and parallelization will work out of the box.
2011-09-20T13:55:51  <andreastt> That would be absolutely fantastic, actually (-:
2011-09-20T13:56:07  <santiycr> :)
2011-09-20T13:56:15  <ruel> im curious if there are clever ways to have multiple firefox versions on a linux box, then use a ci server to dynamically pick a firefox version to run with webdriver.
2011-09-20T13:56:33  <ruel> has anyone done something similiar, or do you use seperate boxes for each of your browser tests

2011-09-20T13:57:14  <lord1234> like if i want input 12
2011-09-20T13:57:38  <lord1234> ruel: seperate boxes
2011-09-20T13:57:47  <santiycr> lord1234: hoping you're using Se2 :)

2011-09-20T13:58:01  <lord1234> whats ur point?
2011-09-20T13:58:08  <santiycr> then just do findElements
2011-09-20T13:58:16  <santiycr> and pull the 12th from the array it returns
2011-09-20T13:58:37  <santiycr> no selector hackery needed
2011-09-20T13:58:53  <santiycr> I've become a pretty big fan of plain selectors in Selenium 2
2011-09-20T13:59:26  <lord1234> yea, lets say I can't do that....
2011-09-20T13:59:29  <santiycr> and a lot more playing with results on the script side
2011-09-20T13:59:33  <lord1234> for multiple reasons
2011-09-20T13:59:41  <lord1234> and that this is an ugly hack until my devs add some fucking id's!
2011-09-20T13:59:53  <lord1234> so any way to do it with css selector?
2011-09-20T14:00:09  <andreastt> Can't you use a :nth-child?
2011-09-20T14:00:18  <lord1234> firepath says no
2011-09-20T14:00:21  <santiycr> well, you gotta understand the tree structure better
2011-09-20T14:00:47  <santiycr> nth-child will only filter the current nodes with the nodes that are nth child of their parents
2011-09-20T14:01:02  <lord1234> santiycr: yes i know, i had already tried it....
2011-09-20T14:01:04  <santiycr> that's why jquery's :nth is awesome
2011-09-20T14:01:47  <santiycr> my advice would be to figure out where is the spot in which the tree gets repeated
2011-09-20T14:01:56  <lord1234> at that input!
2011-09-20T14:02:02  <lord1234> already did that...
2011-09-20T14:02:10  <santiycr> then do the nth-child for the input
2011-09-20T14:02:19  <santiycr> I don't see why it wouldn't work
2011-09-20T14:02:26  <lord1234> the issue is that each div has 2 children
2011-09-20T14:02:32  <lord1234> hrm
2011-09-20T14:03:50  <santiycr> then you have to do div:nth-child(6) > input:nth-child(2)
2011-09-20T14:03:57  <santiycr> or something similar
2011-09-20T14:04:33  <lord1234> fails
2011-09-20T14:05:40  <lord1234> #column_selector>table>tbody>tr:nth-child(2)>*>div:nth-child(5)  selects the 5th div(its present in 6 columns), but if I do #column_selector>table>tbody>tr:nth-child(2)>*>div:nth-child(5)>input  it selects 6 inputs, one in each column....
2011-09-20T14:06:27  <lord1234> inside of the tr:nth-child I have 6 columns...and I have to identify the item through the columns(note the *, whihc I can't avoid)
2011-09-20T14:07:40  <santiycr> I think the main problem that you're having is that you're confused on what nth-child does
2011-09-20T14:07:57  <lord1234> no i know what it does.
2011-09-20T14:07:59  <santiycr> nth-child will select a node that is the nth child in its parent
2011-09-20T14:08:02  <lord1234> right
2011-09-20T14:08:07  <lord1234> but if the parent is pointing at 6 nodes
2011-09-20T14:08:11  <lord1234> then it will select 6 children
2011-09-20T14:08:12  <lord1234> note the *
2011-09-20T14:08:18  <santiycr> if you do div:nth-child, it won't filter by column
2011-09-20T14:08:27  <santiycr> you need to do td:nth-child for that
2011-09-20T14:11:13  <lord1234> right
2011-09-20T14:11:17  <lord1234> gahhhh

2011-09-20T14:19:24  <santiycr> lord1234: you may want to look into xpath instead of css for this particular issue
2011-09-20T14:19:34  <lord1234> fuck xpath.
2011-09-20T14:19:40  <lord1234> seriously, it sucks.
2011-09-20T14:19:47  <lord1234> and it wouldn't work here that well either tbh
2011-09-20T14:19:47  <santiycr> hah
2011-09-20T14:19:57  <santiycr> I think it would
2011-09-20T14:20:08  <santiycr> you can wrap a full xpath in parenthesis and then filter it
2011-09-20T14:20:09  <lord1234> it would, but not when I test in IE....
2011-09-20T14:20:17  <santiycr> (your-full-xpath)[12]

2011-09-20T14:21:15  <santiycr> so I know what you mean
2011-09-20T14:21:32  <lord1234> santiycr: i understand that I could do xpath[12]
2011-09-20T14:21:41  <lord1234> my goal: avoid xpath use unless I absolutely frickin have to
2011-09-20T14:22:15  <lord1234> and since I know id's are incoming, I'm not spending too much time on it
2011-09-20T14:22:17  <santiycr> makes sense
2011-09-20T14:22:32  <santiycr> in this case, feels like you do
2011-09-20T14:22:39  <santiycr> anyways, time to move on

2011-09-20T14:33:09  <santiycr> looking forward to it
2011-09-20T14:33:24  <andreastt> nirvdrum: That's cool!  I did a similar talk at a user group in Oslo recently.
2011-09-20T14:33:43  <lord1234> is it it too early to register?
2011-09-20T14:33:49  <nirvdrum> But, obviously I don't want it to be a vendor pitch.  So I'm abstracting it.

2011-09-20T14:36:31  <nirvdrum> lord1234: There was a vote about where to hold it.
2011-09-20T14:36:46  <nirvdrum> I need to ping the guy at ConstantContact again.  He was supposed to reserve the location.
2011-09-20T14:36:46  <lord1234> is it gonna be in BOS or Waltham?

2011-09-20T14:37:32  <andreastt> Really?  How so?
2011-09-20T14:37:59  <nirvdrum> Their CloudDrive stuff refuses to work with Opera.  As does their Lightning Deals widget.
2011-09-20T14:38:57  <andreastt> Interesting.
