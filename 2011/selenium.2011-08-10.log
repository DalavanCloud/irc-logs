2011-08-10T01:14:00  <Adamantus> Hi. I get most of the "Selenese" but there is one statement which doesn't make sense to me:   xpath=//form[input/\@name='username']    what is the /\ in this statement?
2011-08-10T01:15:01  <Adamantus> I think I get it actually. Input has child elements which have name of username?
2011-08-10T01:15:21  <Binken_> You could search the Xpath tourist

2011-08-10T01:58:28  <barancev> yes, probably
2011-08-10T01:59:03  *** AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
2011-08-10T01:59:03  <barancev> or may be it is a programming language where @ requires quoting
2011-08-10T01:59:47  <barancev> (otherwise it will be interpreted as a variable and will be "expanded")
2011-08-10T01:59:57  <Adamantus> This is just standard xpath, using selenium ide, no selenium rc.

2011-08-10T02:02:24  <dzunka> Hi guys
2011-08-10T02:02:43  <dzunka> Did someone try to automate Samsung TV applications using Selenium or WebDriver?
2011-08-10T02:03:05  <Ajay> what are the Samsung TV apps made of ?
2011-08-10T02:03:19  <Ajay> is it Html ?
2011-08-10T02:03:22  <dzunka> Javascript but they are running on Samsung based browser
2011-08-10T02:03:26  <dzunka> yes
2011-08-10T02:03:31  <dzunka> html + js
2011-08-10T02:04:04  <AutomatedTester> dzunka: i dont think you will be able to do it with webdriver but Selenium may be able to do it
2011-08-10T02:04:38  <AutomatedTester> if you can tell it how to launch the browser
2011-08-10T02:04:59  <barancev> Adamantus: yes, in Selenium IDE you don't need backslash before @, it is a typo in the reference

2011-08-10T02:07:35  <zimnyx> I'm testing page with Dijit widgets using Selenium - do you know some tools that can help me navigate through dijits?
2011-08-10T02:08:06  <dzunka> AutomatedTester: David? Thanks but how to manipulate this browser with help of Selenium ?
2011-08-10T02:08:37  <Ajay> Zimnyx : what does the navigation through dijits mean
2011-08-10T02:09:42  <zimnyx> Ajay: Do you know Dijit widgets a bit?
2011-08-10T02:10:33  <AutomatedTester> dzunka: if you can get the selenium-server to run on the tv then it should be a simple case of selenium = new DefaultSelenium("<tv-ip>",<port>, "*custom path/to/browser", "start-url);
2011-08-10T02:10:37  <Ajay> zimnyx: I know about Dojo tool kit
2011-08-10T02:12:19  <zimnyx> Ajay: When dojo parses your HTML and find dojoType="..." it injects it's own HTML that replaces original widget, for example test input. Finding out correct element that contains input value is a bit hard but not impossible.
2011-08-10T02:12:28  <zimnyx> I thought someone had similar problems
2011-08-10T02:12:50  *** Binken_ has quit IRC
2011-08-10T02:13:13  <zimnyx> Btw, Does selenium support "dom" locator ? It's not available in javascript/atoms/locators/locators.js
2011-08-10T02:18:36  <Ajay> javascript/atoms/dom.js
2011-08-10T02:18:38  <dzunka> AutomatedTester: Great idea. Thank, I will try and provide the results of this
2011-08-10T02:19:02  <Ajay> its used by the locatots in the javascript/atoms/locators
2011-08-10T02:23:04  <zimnyx> Ajay: My library offers locate_element(locator, value). I can use xpath, id, css, but not dom (WebDriverException: Unsupported locator strategy: dom)
2011-08-10T02:23:12  <zimnyx> I wonder how can I use dom locator
2011-08-10T02:24:16  <Ajay> AutomatedTester would be the best person to answer this
2011-08-10T02:24:25  <AutomatedTester> ?

2011-08-10T04:25:29  <gurkensalat> yes
2011-08-10T04:25:43  <AutomatedTester> can I see a stack trace and the test?

2011-08-10T04:38:38  <gurkensalat> okay thanks for your help
2011-08-10T04:39:05  <Binken_> works in RC3
2011-08-10T04:40:10  <AutomatedTester> Binken_: and stopped working in?
2011-08-10T04:40:31  <Binken_> I think the 2.0 release. Let me try on 2.0 release

2011-08-10T05:58:29  <lord1234> selenium doesn't do that....
2011-08-10T05:58:41  <naeg> other ways to achieve that?
2011-08-10T05:58:48  <lord1234> ask your developers?
2011-08-10T05:58:50  <lord1234> use firebug?
2011-08-10T05:58:51  <naeg> because the element i want has display: none
2011-08-10T05:59:10  <lord1234> what do u mean it has display:none?
2011-08-10T05:59:16  <lord1234> whats the html for the element?

2011-08-10T06:00:10  <lord1234> I have a page that can take up to 10 minutes to load(lots of DB processing in background)
2011-08-10T06:00:45  <naeg> lord1234: the html: http://pastebin.com/Y6dQSzG1
2011-08-10T06:01:03  *** RossPatterson has joined #selenium
2011-08-10T06:01:20  <lord1234> you can't key off of "id="ctl00_Content_PhotoUpload_iu_fuImage"?

2011-08-10T06:01:48  <lord1234> or is that a non-unique ID?
2011-08-10T06:02:02  <naeg> but it always says i can't do things with element which are not displayed
2011-08-10T06:02:26  <lord1234> thats a CSS style
2011-08-10T06:02:33  <lord1234> and yes, it has to be visible on the screen
2011-08-10T06:02:36  <lord1234> why is it not visible?
2011-08-10T06:02:41  <lord1234> do you have to click something to make it show up or some such?
2011-08-10T06:03:09  <naeg> lord1234: nope, it's not visible by default. there are 2 uploads, flash and html. if you have flash, html is disabled
2011-08-10T06:03:17  <naeg> and i somehow can't click on that flash button
2011-08-10T06:03:27  <naeg> (very new to selenium)
2011-08-10T06:03:28  <lord1234> yea...you can't click on Flash elements using selenium
2011-08-10T06:03:43  <naeg> i thought so, that's why i need that html to be visible...
2011-08-10T06:03:52  <lord1234> so set up your browser profile to not have flash installed?
2011-08-10T06:04:17  <naeg> that's the other :) will try to figure out how, thanks
2011-08-10T06:04:38  <naeg> i thought i might could manipulate the html somehow, but as you said that's not possible with selenium

2011-08-10T06:06:13  <jimevans> g'day
2011-08-10T06:06:21  <lord1234> question for you
2011-08-10T06:06:25  <jimevans> go ahead
2011-08-10T06:06:32  <lord1234> any way to change the timeout for the $selenium.get command when using WebDriver?
2011-08-10T06:06:43  <jimevans> nope.
2011-08-10T06:06:54  <lord1234> so how would you suggest getting a page that has a ~10 minute load time?
2011-08-10T06:07:30  <jimevans> figure out why the page takes 10 minutes and fix it? :)
2011-08-10T06:07:52  <jimevans> more seriously, though, i don't have an answer.
2011-08-10T06:08:11  <jimevans> there's actually a current thread on the selenium developers list about exactly this scenario.
2011-08-10T06:08:20  <lord1234> jim:  actually i know exactly why
2011-08-10T06:08:28  <lord1234> it runs a db query that takes forever
2011-08-10T06:08:37  <lord1234> perhaps add an optional timeout parameter to the get method?
2011-08-10T06:08:44  *** simonstewart has joined #selenium
2011-08-10T06:08:51  <jimevans> g'day simonstewart

2011-08-10T06:09:12  <simonstewart> daniel's still working out why the IE tests are failing
2011-08-10T06:09:17  <jimevans> lord1234 and i were just talking about how to handle a page with a load time of 10 minutes.
2011-08-10T06:09:24  <simonstewart> Once that's fixed, we can push 2.4
2011-08-10T06:09:27  <jimevans> ok
2011-08-10T06:09:48  <simonstewart> heh.
2011-08-10T06:10:01  <simonstewart> that's the exact same conversation we've been having on the developers list
2011-08-10T06:10:08  <jimevans> i was just saying that.
2011-08-10T06:10:13  <lord1234> perhaps add an optional timeout parameter to the get method?
2011-08-10T06:10:35  <simonstewart> driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoad(30, SECONDS, false)
2011-08-10T06:10:41  <simonstewart> is the proposed signature
2011-08-10T06:10:54  <AutomatedTester> hihi simonstewart
2011-08-10T06:10:54  <simonstewart> because there's more than one thing that causes a page to load
2011-08-10T06:10:54  <simonstewart> and
2011-08-10T06:11:08  <lord1234> and that sets the driver for that session...neat.
2011-08-10T06:11:09  <simonstewart> adding the timeout to each of those methods is fugly
2011-08-10T06:11:13  <lord1234> good point.
2011-08-10T06:11:13  <simonstewart> hi AutomatedTester
2011-08-10T06:11:23  <lord1234> simonstewart: when do you think that will be ready?
2011-08-10T06:11:31  <simonstewart> Not sure
2011-08-10T06:11:45  <simonstewart> Implementing it also means being clear about what we mean by "loaded"
2011-08-10T06:12:11  <simonstewart> so far the majority view appears to be when "document.readyState == 'interactive'"
2011-08-10T06:12:35  <simonstewart> But I want to run some tests on a large suite of existing tests to see what the practical effect of this is
2011-08-10T06:19:11  <naeg> someone has a hint on handling dialog box on linux for file upload? can't use autoit
2011-08-10T06:20:20  <simonstewart> naeg: just "sendKeys" to the file input element with the path to the file
2011-08-10T06:21:11  <naeg> simonstewart: i can't type into that field (not by hand, nor by send_keys())
2011-08-10T06:21:37  <simonstewart> It's an "input type=file" right?
2011-08-10T06:22:13  <naeg> simonstewart: yes (see here for html code: http://pastebin.com/Y6dQSzG1)
2011-08-10T06:22:47  <naeg> (ignore the "display: one;")
2011-08-10T06:22:55  <naeg> none*
2011-08-10T06:23:48  <naeg> i read that there is autoIt for windows and it can be done with apple script on mac
2011-08-10T06:23:56  <naeg> but dunno what's the best solution on linux
2011-08-10T06:24:12  <jimevans> naeg: what happens if you try to sendKeys() to the file input?
2011-08-10T06:24:24  <simonstewart> driver.findElement(By.name("ct100....")).sendKeys("/path/to/file");
2011-08-10T06:25:46  <naeg> jimevans: simonstewart: okay that works :s i thought it would not work because i just tried to send "asdf" and nothing happenend, but with a real path to a real file it does happen something
2011-08-10T06:25:51  <naeg> thanks to both of you :)
2011-08-10T06:26:40  <simonstewart> np :)

2011-08-10T06:37:21  <simonstewart> several reasons.
2011-08-10T06:37:29  <simonstewart> The main one being I've never needed to test them

2011-08-10T09:06:48  <andytinkham> Hey, how's it going? :)
2011-08-10T09:07:14  <andreashaas> hi lord1234
2011-08-10T09:07:24  <lord1234> so here's a question
2011-08-10T09:07:55  <lord1234> i have an element on a page "<button id="btnNewCat" class="wizard_button" _cid="259" _aid="3">New</button>"  which I am trying to element.click
2011-08-10T09:08:15  <lord1234> I can't seem to find it via $browser.find_element(:id => "btnNewCat")
2011-08-10T09:08:30  <lord1234> i think it might be because its not fully loaded, even though webdriver things the page is loaded
2011-08-10T09:08:56  <lord1234> thoughts?
2011-08-10T09:09:10  <andreashaas> do you use IE?
2011-08-10T09:10:03  <nirvdrum> What are _cid and _aid?
2011-08-10T09:10:10  <lord1234> no clue, i don't use them.
2011-08-10T09:10:13  <lord1234> oh
2011-08-10T09:10:32  <lord1234> cid stands for client id...aid is the "step"  as in we are on step 3 of this "process"
2011-08-10T09:10:37  <andytinkham> lord1234: Could you do a while loop until you either find the element or hit some timeout value?
2011-08-10T09:10:43  <nirvdrum> Ouch.
2011-08-10T09:10:45  <lord1234> yea i think tahts what i'm gonna have to do

2011-08-10T09:12:19  <lord1234> andy:  like this?  while(!$browser.find_element(:id => "btnNewCat"))
2011-08-10T09:12:22  <lord1234> or would you do it some other way?
2011-08-10T09:12:36  <andreashaas> You can use WebDriverWait

2011-08-10T09:13:24  <andytinkham> Yeah, like andreashaas says.  (Plus if the the control never appears, you get an infinite loop without an explicit timeout). Just a sec...

2011-08-10T09:21:56  <andytinkham> Let me make another gist :) (wait_for_appearance and wait_for_disappearance become instance methods in my classes that represent the elements. Element is another instance method that takes the locator type and string defined in those element classes and finds the element

2011-08-10T09:31:30  <lord1234> sleeps are bad because they are told to us in CS training
2011-08-10T09:31:32  <lord1234> "sleeps are bad"
2011-08-10T09:31:42  <lord1234> but in general, minor use of sleeps is ok.
2011-08-10T09:36:05  <andytinkham> I actually fall a little bit in the middle on pro-sleeps, anti-sleeps. In general, I think there are better ways to handle things than simply sleeping and I try to avoid them, but I wouldn't say they're absolutely banned in my code either

2011-08-10T09:39:17  <nirvdrum> Sleeps are bad when you have no control over the external timing because there's simply no guarantee the sleep will be long enough.  You're just playing a probability game if you add them.  But if you're aware of it, and can weight the pros and cons, then cool.
2011-08-10T09:39:19  <andytinkham> (And I think sleeps are bad for more reasons than just we're told they are - if you're running on differently performing hardware, you tend to get either too short a wait or you're spending time waiting you don't need to wait. With that said, though, the Selenium Wait object uses a sleep to make the interval work, and for that sort of thing, sleeps are ok (we're actually waiting for time to elapse, not for something else to happ

2011-08-10T10:23:57  <jimevans> Parabola: okay, what nirvdrum is suggesting is that you fire up the selenium server on the VM
2011-08-10T10:24:12  <Parabola> okay, i am using remotewebdriver
2011-08-10T10:24:28  <Parabola> or rather, i already was
2011-08-10T10:24:46  <Parabola> may i recommend removing that webdriver-all.zip download link, or noting that isnt the only way to get it :)
2011-08-10T10:25:54  <Parabola> jimevans: okay
2011-08-10T10:26:20  <nirvdrum> Parabola: Are you using the RC protocol or the WebDriver protocol?
2011-08-10T10:26:33  <Parabola> i'm going to go with the second one

2011-08-10T10:27:40  <nirvdrum> Okay.  Now I'm confused.  If you are or were using RemoteWebDriver, you'd definitely know it because you'd have to wrap your capabilities in it, as demonstrated on that wiki page.
2011-08-10T10:27:48  <nirvdrum> So, either that looks foreign to you or it looks familiar.
2011-08-10T10:28:16  <Parabola> you're confused because you're talking to me like a fellow longtime selenium/webdriver user or contributer
2011-08-10T10:28:20  <Parabola> which is not the case
2011-08-10T10:28:27  <ebass> I was wondering if there was any way to define browser environments in Grid 2 like you could with Grid 1?
2011-08-10T10:28:31  <Parabola> or assuming I know what you know
2011-08-10T10:28:41  <Parabola> ebass: such as?
2011-08-10T10:29:13  *** blowery_off is now known as blowery
2011-08-10T10:29:22  <ebass> we used to set up custom environments that could route us to specific versions of browsers with specific plugins installed.
2011-08-10T10:29:28  <jimevans> Parabola: refresh my memory, it works when you execute the code directly on the VM using "new InternetExplorerDriver()", right?
2011-08-10T10:29:32  <ebass> now it seems like i have only the choice of browserName's available
2011-08-10T10:30:02  <Parabola> jimevans: correct
2011-08-10T10:30:22  <jimevans> does it work when you have the selenium server running on the VM and you use "new RemoteWebDriver()"?
2011-08-10T10:30:25  <nirvdrum> Parabola: Not really.  I'm confused because you gave me two contradictory pieces of information.  All I'm trying to do is resolve that so we're on common ground.
2011-08-10T10:30:46  <Parabola> nirvdrum: and i'm sorry I cannot answer them because I dont want to give you wrong information
2011-08-10T10:30:56  <Parabola> if you look at the java code i pastebin'ed it might help
2011-08-10T10:31:01  <Parabola> if you dont wish to do that, then its fine
2011-08-10T10:31:40  <jimevans> Parabola: ^^
2011-08-10T10:31:51  <nirvdrum> I didn't see the link.  Apologies.
2011-08-10T10:31:59  <ebass> http://pastebin.com/2aqBubPM
2011-08-10T10:32:30  <Parabola> ah thanks ebass  :)

2011-08-10T10:33:02  <Parabola> nirvdrum: i'm trying to be as helpful as I can, and i know how devastating wrong answers can be :)
2011-08-10T10:33:20  <jimevans> Parabola: the code you pasted works or not?
2011-08-10T10:33:23  <Parabola> nirvdrum: thats why i'm saying I dont know, because i'm not 100% sure, i've followed webdriver examples, not RC examples
2011-08-10T10:33:34  <Parabola> jimevans: i get the nullpointer with taht code on the .get(URL)
2011-08-10T10:33:41  <Parabola> browser does launch on the VM though
2011-08-10T10:33:50  <jimevans> okay, then grid isn't involved at that point.
2011-08-10T10:33:57  <Parabola> uh
2011-08-10T10:34:08  <Parabola> if i from my machine run the code, how is the VM being told to launch IE?
2011-08-10T10:34:10  <jimevans> RemoteWebDriver != grid (necessarily)
2011-08-10T10:34:15  <Parabola> oh
2011-08-10T10:34:20  <Parabola> well then :)
2011-08-10T10:34:33  <Parabola> I thought grid was the product that managed which nodes could do what
2011-08-10T10:34:36  <Parabola> and routed the requests?
2011-08-10T10:34:59  <ebass> when you started the selenium server on the VM did you register it to the hub server or no?
2011-08-10T10:35:05  <nirvdrum> It is, but it's a wrapper around RemoteWebDriver and as such, has nothing to do with browser instantiation.
2011-08-10T10:35:20  <nirvdrum> Which is why I was trying to debug through RemoteWebDriver.
2011-08-10T10:35:26  <Parabola> ebass: yup
2011-08-10T10:36:15  <jimevans> Parabola: alright, the next step is to try using RemoteWebDriver *without* using grid.
2011-08-10T10:36:24  <jimevans> that is, without registering the node with the hub.
2011-08-10T10:36:25  <ebass> have you tried pointing your remotewebdriver directly @ the server running on the VM to see if the problem is with the grid?
2011-08-10T10:37:01  <ebass> you dont necessarily need to not register the node to the hub...you can still connect directly to the node server
2011-08-10T10:37:10  <Parabola> jimevans: okay, what would be the URL I would use to access it?
2011-08-10T10:37:13  *** netcarver has joined #selenium
2011-08-10T10:37:42  <Parabola> nevermind that
2011-08-10T10:37:43  <jimevans> "http://<virtualmachine>:4444/wd/hub" (assuming defaults)
2011-08-10T10:37:49  <ebass> hehe
2011-08-10T10:37:51  <Parabola> okay, well theres some good news
2011-08-10T10:37:54  <ebass> u beat me to it jimevans
2011-08-10T10:38:01  <Parabola> The info I found on google, told me to use that URL
2011-08-10T10:38:06  <Parabola> so thats what i'm currently doing
2011-08-10T10:38:35  <Parabola> I'm not sure i'm even starting these right
2011-08-10T10:38:41  <Parabola> java -jar C:\selenium\selenium-server-standalone-2.3.0.jar -role hub <-- what i'm using to start the hub
2011-08-10T10:38:52  <ebass> thats good.
2011-08-10T10:38:56  <Parabola> java -jar C:\selenium\selenium-server-standalone-2.3.0.jar -role wd -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register -port 5556 -browser browserName="internet explorer",version=7,platform=windows ,ensureCleanSession=true
2011-08-10T10:39:04  <Parabola> <-- thats for the first node (running on the same VM)
2011-08-10T10:39:17  <jimevans> ah. okay.
2011-08-10T10:39:19  <ebass> does it matter that platform isnt capital WINDOWS?
2011-08-10T10:39:26  <Parabola> ebass: i'm not sure
2011-08-10T10:39:28  <ebass> i noticed its always ALL CAPS
2011-08-10T10:39:33  <Parabola> google example had no caps

2011-08-10T10:39:38  <ebass> ah ok
2011-08-10T10:39:46  <Parabola> I'm not sure honestly :-\
2011-08-10T10:39:51  <ebass> if u wanted to connect directly to the node
2011-08-10T10:39:58  *** angshu has joined #selenium
2011-08-10T10:39:59  <ebass> u need to change the port in ur code to 5556
2011-08-10T10:40:05  <jimevans> try going directly against the node server instance using http://<vm>:5556/wd/hub
2011-08-10T10:40:46  <Parabola> okay :)
2011-08-10T10:40:57  <Parabola> just for the sake of completeness, what URL should i be using if i wanted to access the hub
2011-08-10T10:41:00  <Parabola> not the node
2011-08-10T10:41:06  <jimevans> that will bypass using the hub altogether, and we can see if it's grid, or remote
2011-08-10T10:41:10  <gbochenek> Hey so I'm having an issue using the InternetExplorer Driver, where the mouse click actually drags a tiny bit making the click useless.  Has anyone seen that before?  The tests work fine with ChromeDriver and FirefoxDriver
2011-08-10T10:41:14  <jimevans> port 4444 for the hub.
2011-08-10T10:41:20  <Parabola> that would be the only change?
2011-08-10T10:41:21  <Parabola> okay
2011-08-10T10:41:26  <ebass> yes
2011-08-10T10:41:41  <jimevans> if you're running the node and the hub on the same box (which you are), yes, that's the only change.
2011-08-10T10:41:57  <Parabola> sweet
2011-08-10T10:41:59  <ebass> if your code is running on the same machine then you can still use the same host or localhost name that you were
2011-08-10T10:42:18  <ebass> i would just remove the platform windows from the configuration for the node
2011-08-10T10:42:26  <ebass> IE doesnt really run anywhere else does it :-P

2011-08-10T10:43:25  <ebass> yea thats right
2011-08-10T10:43:25  <lukeis> i would suggest removing all options and just do "java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.3.0.jar"
2011-08-10T10:43:30  <ebass> shut down the node server
2011-08-10T10:43:37  <ebass> and change the browser configuration switch
2011-08-10T10:43:38  <lukeis> (for debugging)
2011-08-10T10:44:00  <jimevans> gbochenek: i've not seen that with the ie driver.

2011-08-10T10:44:33  <ebass> nirvdrum: I was wondering if there was any way to define browser environments in Grid 2 like you could with Grid 1?
2011-08-10T10:45:01  <jimevans> gbochenek: are you using the click() method on WebElement, or are you trying to use the Actions class?
2011-08-10T10:45:16  <nirvdrum> ebass: Grid 2 will read the old grid 1 configuration YAML.  But there's a different way for the capability interface.
2011-08-10T10:45:38  <gbochenek> jimevans: I've tried both click() on the web element and mouse.click((Locatable....
2011-08-10T10:45:40  <Parabola> same thing
2011-08-10T10:45:59  <ebass> go with what lukeis suggested
2011-08-10T10:46:10  <ebass> restart the server with no options
2011-08-10T10:46:18  <Parabola> :-\
2011-08-10T10:46:23  <Parabola> how will it know to listen for anything?
2011-08-10T10:46:25  <ebass> and we can work back to what you want.
2011-08-10T10:46:31  <jimevans> gbochenek: so, click on WebElement is what I'd work with first.
2011-08-10T10:46:32  <ebass> well, use the -port
2011-08-10T10:46:39  <lukeis> it defaults the port to 4444
2011-08-10T10:46:40  <jimevans> Parabola: it just knows :)
2011-08-10T10:46:41  <ebass> i mean the custom browser configurations
2011-08-10T10:46:50  <Parabola> okay hold up
2011-08-10T10:46:58  <Parabola> so for the node launch options
2011-08-10T10:46:59  <selbot2_> dawagner half a minute ago - DanielWagnerHall: Simplify click codepath because we delegate down to the atoms which should deal with a lot of the checks happening here.  Significant change is that if the atoms fail (which should only be called if we try to click a option), we don't fall back to native clicking (which doesn't work for options) - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=13311
2011-08-10T10:47:01  <Parabola> dont use anything
2011-08-10T10:47:05  <Parabola> is that what you want me to try?
2011-08-10T10:47:18  <Parabola> and shut down the server
2011-08-10T10:47:28  <lukeis> Parabola: we want you to try to just do a remote connection to a single standalone server (no grid)
2011-08-10T10:47:41  *** dawagner has quit IRC
2011-08-10T10:47:44  <lukeis> so the only thing running should be one "java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.3.0.jar"
2011-08-10T10:48:01  <lukeis> and then execute your script with port 4444 as the connecting port
2011-08-10T10:48:12  <ebass> you will need to shut down your hub server
2011-08-10T10:48:17  <ebass> if its on the same machine
2011-08-10T10:48:30  <ebass> because its probably got port 4444
2011-08-10T10:48:35  <lukeis> yeah, kill the other java processes ;)
2011-08-10T10:49:19  <lukeis> shutdown is not a term i would give a sysadmin... no rebooting of the machines necessary ;)
2011-08-10T10:49:19  <Parabola> kk

2011-08-10T10:52:15  <jimevans> gbochenek: ah. i see. using WebElement.click() clicks at the center of the element, and there's virtually no chance of any drag happening.
2011-08-10T10:53:10  <lukeis> Parabola: bummer.... :(   you actually using foo.com? or something else?
2011-08-10T10:53:34  <Parabola> somthing else :P
2011-08-10T10:53:41  <lukeis> just making sure...
2011-08-10T10:53:46  <Parabola> well this sucks
2011-08-10T10:53:55  <Parabola> this just made all the work i've done thus far pointless
2011-08-10T10:54:06  <lukeis> not really, i don't think
2011-08-10T10:54:08  <Parabola> if this doesnt work, my company has no use for this
2011-08-10T10:54:34  <lukeis> it works for others, so there's just something going wrong we don't know yet
2011-08-10T10:55:02  <gbochenek> jimevans: yep.  i'm using that, and i can see the mouse moving to the center of the div (there's a div that follows the cursor), the behavior i'm seeing indicates a reaction to a drag, although a very small one.  If a drag isn't happening, then i'm still not seeing the reaction to a click behavior.
2011-08-10T10:55:14  <lukeis> Parabola: can you pastebin any output from the command prompt for the selenium-server?

2011-08-10T11:03:36  <lord1234> i fixed it
2011-08-10T11:03:42  <lord1234> sorry my bosses name is Erik, so its easy to screw up
2011-08-10T11:04:21  <Parabola> alright
2011-08-10T11:04:27  <Parabola> no making fun of my bad java code :) (any tips welcome!)
2011-08-10T11:04:29  <Parabola> http://pastebin.com/FiG1EF8j
2011-08-10T11:04:34  <ebass> yea so create an actions object. then you can do action.moveToElement(element);
2011-08-10T11:04:43  <jimevans> got your problem right away.
2011-08-10T11:04:46  <lord1234> yea i see it
2011-08-10T11:04:55  <lord1234> move_to(element) in ruby webdriver
2011-08-10T11:04:56  <jimevans> the driver variable is local to ie7Setup.
2011-08-10T11:04:58  <ebass> then action.perform()
2011-08-10T11:05:14  <ebass> not sure, I use Java API
2011-08-10T11:05:26  <Parabola> jimevans: who what
2011-08-10T11:05:39  <jimevans> Parabola: the driver variable in b2bLoginTester() is always null.
2011-08-10T11:05:49  <ebass> lord1234: funny we met here...
2011-08-10T11:05:58  <lord1234> i just said that chris
2011-08-10T11:06:02  <Parabola> jimevans: hmm
2011-08-10T11:06:11  <Parabola> jimevans: why does it work locally then
2011-08-10T11:06:14  <jimevans> Parabola: in the method ie7SetUp(), that's where you declare the variable "driver". No other method can see that variable.
2011-08-10T11:06:14  <lord1234> i'm new to webdriver, all my old stuff was Selenium and I am refactoring to webdriver.
2011-08-10T11:06:24  <ebass> right.
2011-08-10T11:06:34  <Parabola> if i dont use remotewebdriver it works (forgive my ignorance)
2011-08-10T11:06:34  <ebass> we are trying to migrate
2011-08-10T11:06:48  <ebass> but our WebDriverBackedSelenium test cases are twice as slow as they used to be...
2011-08-10T11:07:00  <lord1234> yuck
2011-08-10T11:07:02  <ebass> yea
2011-08-10T11:07:09  <lord1234> lol i almost got a job at your place a long time ago.
2011-08-10T11:07:10  <barancev> just found that RemoteWebElement still has toggle and setSelected methods
2011-08-10T11:07:11  <lord1234> like...4 years ago
2011-08-10T11:07:22  <jimevans> Parabola: i've no idea.
2011-08-10T11:07:38  <Parabola> jimevans: so what would be a good method of resolution
2011-08-10T11:07:47  <jimevans> however, wait a tick.
2011-08-10T11:07:48  <ebass> its because the Atoms they use do a ton of checking for visibility and what not
2011-08-10T11:08:47  <ebass> lord1234: do you know where i work?
2011-08-10T11:08:53  <lord1234> linked in does.
2011-08-10T11:08:53  <jimevans> Parabola: try this http://pastebin.com/wUbGpzzH
2011-08-10T11:09:27  <ebass> yea
2011-08-10T11:09:36  *** sventheman has quit IRC
2011-08-10T11:10:07  <jimevans> (yes technically, i know it should be "private WebDriver driver;", but I was in a hurry.)
2011-08-10T11:10:37  <Parabola> what did you change?
2011-08-10T11:10:48  <jimevans> Parabola: what I did was move the definition of the driver variable to be a member of the class, not just declared inside a method.
2011-08-10T11:11:04  <jimevans> that way, it should be available to all methods of the class.
2011-08-10T11:11:07  *** sventheman has joined #selenium
2011-08-10T11:11:39  <jimevans> wait another tick.
2011-08-10T11:11:49  <Parabola> oh i see
2011-08-10T11:11:56  <jimevans> does your SharedMethods class have a "driver" member variable?
2011-08-10T11:11:58  <gbochenek> jimevans: alright I just wrote a simple test case using one of the samples for the api.  works for Firefox but not IE (Thread sleep is just so we have some time to watch the behavior): http://pastebin.com/iRCpZEhD
2011-08-10T11:12:57  <andytinkham> Would I incur wrath if I posted a single post about a job opening on my team to the selenium-users mailing list next week?
2011-08-10T11:13:19  <jimevans> andytinkham: i'd be incensed! no, i'm kidding.
2011-08-10T11:13:19  <Parabola> it does not
2011-08-10T11:13:43  <lord1234> you incur the wrath of cthulu
2011-08-10T11:13:49  <andytinkham> jimevans: Want to come join my team? :)
2011-08-10T11:14:01  <andytinkham> lord1234: I think I tend towards that anyhow
2011-08-10T11:14:22  <lord1234> andytinkham: can I work remote?
2011-08-10T11:14:24  <jimevans> andytinkham: would I have to move to Minnesota?
2011-08-10T11:14:30  <lord1234> jinx
2011-08-10T11:14:37  <jimevans> (you are in Minnesota, right?)
2011-08-10T11:15:07  <andytinkham> lord1234: Only if you're local to MN doing it (ie. you don't necessarily have to always come into the office, but you need to be able to do so). jimevans: Yes and yes.
2011-08-10T11:15:25  <XRayCulver> andytinkham: nice to see someone near me, I'm in Fargo
2011-08-10T11:15:29  <lord1234> andytinkham: i'll stay in boston, i have a friend in minnesota...he says its boring as hell:-P
2011-08-10T11:15:33  <jimevans> Parabola: so give that earlier pastebin a shot, and see if it works.
2011-08-10T11:15:35  <andytinkham> XRayCulver: Cool!
2011-08-10T11:15:37  <Parabola> kk
2011-08-10T11:15:38  <lord1234> there you go..XRayCulver is your boy.
2011-08-10T11:15:39  <Parabola> testing
2011-08-10T11:15:50  <ebass> nirvdrum: how would i use the capability interface to do the same thing,  I would prefer not to use yaml files anymore?  I've tried specifying a browserName that isn't in the list and the grid didnt like that :-/
2011-08-10T11:16:01  <andytinkham> lord1234: I beg to differ :) Hell is far more boring (though there is a Hell, MN, I think, which is an interesting conundrum in this context)
2011-08-10T11:16:30  <lord1234> eric what are you trying to do?
2011-08-10T11:16:56  <andytinkham> XRayCulver: West side of the Twin Cities, myself
2011-08-10T11:16:59  <ebass> im trying to setup some custom environments in Grid 2
2011-08-10T11:17:06  <jimevans> andytinkham: I think The Wife would kill me if I suggested we move to MN. :)
2011-08-10T11:17:29  <nirvdrum> ebass: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2
2011-08-10T11:17:30  <Parabola> no go
2011-08-10T11:17:39  <Parabola> and i lied, i do have webdriver in my shared methods
2011-08-10T11:17:44  <Parabola> public class SharedMethods {
2011-08-10T11:17:44  <Parabola> 	protected WebDriver driver;
2011-08-10T11:17:51  <jimevans> aha.
2011-08-10T11:17:51  <lord1234> andytinkham: i am available to fly in once a month as long as I can work at home
2011-08-10T11:17:56  <Ajay__> lukeis:hi
2011-08-10T11:18:03  <Parabola> sorry, i forgot the code i wrote 2 weeks ago :)
2011-08-10T11:18:05  <ebass> we had some "special" browser configurations in our grid 1 yaml file.
2011-08-10T11:18:34  <jimevans> okay, then, get rid of the "WebDriver driver;" line in B2BLoginTester altogether.
2011-08-10T11:18:56  <andytinkham> lord1234: Unfortunately, my senior vp and director are unhappy with remote employees after we had performance problems with one. Any remoteness (even one of our other offices, really, right now) is a no go
2011-08-10T11:18:57  <ebass> nirvdrum: ive read that page a few times.  arent the capabilities only for WebDriver?
2011-08-10T11:19:06  <lord1234> too bad
2011-08-10T11:19:27  <Parabola> jimevans:  i did
2011-08-10T11:19:32  <Parabola> :(
2011-08-10T11:19:36  <jimevans> Parabola: Also, be sure the third line of ie7SetUp() does *not* have WebDriver in it.
2011-08-10T11:19:40  <lukeis> Ajay__: hi
2011-08-10T11:19:50  <nirvdrum> ebass: Not sure.  I haven't tried with RC.  I still use the grid 1 launchers.
2011-08-10T11:19:55  <Parabola> okay jimevans
2011-08-10T11:20:06  <Parabola> what should i replace it with?
2011-08-10T11:20:08  <jimevans> Parabola: it should simply say "driver =" not "WebDriver driver="
2011-08-10T11:20:11  <Parabola> kk
2011-08-10T11:20:21  <Parabola> thats a good catch
2011-08-10T11:20:26  <Parabola> <-- my first time ever coding in java

2011-08-10T11:38:30  <Ajay__> lukeis:attached with the new patch , let me know if you are not able to apply
2011-08-10T11:38:55  <barancev> I see that EventFiringWebDriver.createWebElement() creates a WebElement proxy object that is not accepted by executeScript method
2011-08-10T11:39:38  <barancev> is it possible to work around this problem without EventFiringWebDriver code modification?
2011-08-10T11:39:47  <gbochenek> hey does anyone know why this test would register the click event in Chrome and Firefox, but not IE? It almost looks like the click is causing a slight drag in IE: http://pastebin.com/iRCpZEhD

2011-08-10T12:01:18  <XRayCulver> distracted
2011-08-10T12:03:04  <lukeis> what is IsOnPage
2011-08-10T12:03:43  <XRayCulver> an abstract method with a check that looks at an iwebelement for a value
2011-08-10T12:03:58  <XRayCulver> its an element that looks at the h2 for the page and checks the text for the correct page title
2011-08-10T12:04:08  <XRayCulver> each page object has its own title
2011-08-10T12:04:27  <XRayCulver> err
2011-08-10T12:04:31  <XRayCulver> its an abstract boolean
2011-08-10T12:04:32  <lukeis> ok... i'm not a big c# guy, but you can call the method without () or a context object?
2011-08-10T12:04:38  <lukeis> ah ;)
2011-08-10T12:05:04  <XRayCulver> hmm
2011-08-10T12:05:06  <XRayCulver> this wont work
2011-08-10T12:05:08  <XRayCulver> i need to move it
2011-08-10T12:05:23  <XRayCulver> when the page object gets created it fires off the check in its constructor
2011-08-10T12:05:48  <XRayCulver> gah
2011-08-10T12:05:51  <lukeis> then the wait seems pointless ;)
2011-08-10T12:05:58  <XRayCulver> its a property
2011-08-10T12:05:59  *** miker2 has quit IRC
2011-08-10T12:06:00  <XRayCulver> that fires on get
2011-08-10T12:06:07  <XRayCulver> so its basically a getter method
2011-08-10T12:06:18  <XRayCulver> so when i access the property it checks the webelement value
2011-08-10T12:06:21  <XRayCulver> so i want it to keep checking
2011-08-10T12:06:48  <Ajay__> me neither done anything on C#
2011-08-10T12:06:50  <lukeis> ok... does it's parent object have the driver already or something?
2011-08-10T12:06:50  <Ajay__> https://gist.github.com/1137859
2011-08-10T12:06:54  <XRayCulver> yah
2011-08-10T12:06:56  <XRayCulver> the page does
2011-08-10T12:07:00  <XRayCulver> thats the Driver
2011-08-10T12:07:09  <XRayCulver> in the wait initilizer
2011-08-10T12:07:23  <XRayCulver> they all use the same driver reference
2011-08-10T12:07:28  <Ajay__> XRayCulver: shared a sample snippet
2011-08-10T12:08:22  <XRayCulver> i see your revision on the side
2011-08-10T12:08:28  <XRayCulver> but how do i see the code change?
2011-08-10T12:08:29  <lukeis> ok, just be careful, since the point of passing in the driver object was so you can have multiple instances of it floating around and usually don't know which one you have in the wait iteslf
2011-08-10T12:08:34  <XRayCulver> i hardly use gist
2011-08-10T12:08:48  <XRayCulver> lukeis: i ahve an environmanager
2011-08-10T12:08:53  <XRayCulver> they all get the driver from that
2011-08-10T12:09:31  <lukeis> i see you haven't come across a test that needs two browsers open yet then ;)
2011-08-10T12:09:34  <XRayCulver> i have
2011-08-10T12:09:46  <XRayCulver> i'll modify my environment manager to have an array of drivers
2011-08-10T12:10:06  <XRayCulver> but its all centralized
2011-08-10T12:10:37  <XRayCulver> i copied the environment manager out of the webdriver code .net tests
2011-08-10T12:10:49  <XRayCulver> modified it a bit
2011-08-10T12:11:18  <lukeis> sounds a little global variable esque to me... but if it works for ya :)
2011-08-10T12:11:33  <XRayCulver> it kind of is
2011-08-10T12:12:28  <XRayCulver> Ajay__: i'm not seeing your sample
2011-08-10T12:12:47  <Ajay__> https://gist.github.com/1137859
2011-08-10T12:12:57  <XRayCulver> thanks
2011-08-10T12:13:12  <Ajay__> its in java dont curse me
2011-08-10T12:13:16  <XRayCulver> np
2011-08-10T12:13:21  <XRayCulver> close enough to figure out how it works
2011-08-10T12:14:33  <lukeis> did you see the sample here: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html
2011-08-10T12:14:52  <XRayCulver> no
2011-08-10T12:14:55  <XRayCulver> good to know
2011-08-10T12:14:58  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-08-10T12:15:23  <lukeis> from what it sounds like your until should just return IsOnPage ... then you should catch the TimeoutException and log or raise accordingly
2011-08-10T12:15:35  <jimevans> XRayCulver: just popped in for a second, but is https://gist.github.com/1137893 close to what you'd want?
2011-08-10T12:16:05  <XRayCulver> exactly
2011-08-10T12:16:14  <lukeis> jimevans: wouldn't it through an exception beforehand if it was false?
2011-08-10T12:16:17  <lukeis> java does
2011-08-10T12:16:17  <XRayCulver> the Until<bool> says i'm expecting a bool true
2011-08-10T12:16:35  <jimevans> well, aren't you?
2011-08-10T12:16:38  <XRayCulver> yes

2011-08-10T12:16:50  <XRayCulver> just verifying whats going on there
2011-08-10T12:17:28  <jimevans> lukeis: no, .net won't throw if false.
2011-08-10T12:17:38  <jimevans> not for a boolean value anyway.
2011-08-10T12:17:42  <lukeis> ok
2011-08-10T12:17:52  <lukeis> subtle difference
2011-08-10T12:18:05  <XRayCulver> jimevans: wont that continue whether its true or false?
2011-08-10T12:18:31  <XRayCulver> how is the <type> evaluated?
2011-08-10T12:18:39  <XRayCulver> aka, if its <IWebElement>
2011-08-10T12:18:58  <XRayCulver> is it either bool - true, or object = null?
2011-08-10T12:18:59  <jimevans> ah, sorry. for a boolean value, we wait for true. for any other nullable type, we wait for != null
2011-08-10T12:19:05  <XRayCulver> ok
2011-08-10T12:19:09  <XRayCulver> just as i thought
2011-08-10T12:19:21  <XRayCulver> thats pretty cool
2011-08-10T12:19:32  <jimevans> yeah, if the condition doesn't return true within the timeout, it'll throw.
2011-08-10T12:19:43  <XRayCulver> thats exactly what i need
2011-08-10T12:19:59  <XRayCulver> wait
2011-08-10T12:20:04  <XRayCulver> it'll throw?
2011-08-10T12:20:08  <XRayCulver> so i'll throw on the wait?
2011-08-10T12:20:09  <jimevans> a timeout exception
2011-08-10T12:20:11  <XRayCulver> and not the if below
2011-08-10T12:20:19  <jimevans> no, on the wait. sorry.
2011-08-10T12:20:33  <jimevans> i'm multitasking, and made a mistake.
2011-08-10T12:20:43  <XRayCulver> i can remove the if
2011-08-10T12:20:47  <XRayCulver> and just catch the timeout exception?
2011-08-10T12:20:54  <XRayCulver> and throw my exception
2011-08-10T12:21:07  <lukeis> jimevans: so, yeah it's like java and if always false there's a timeout exception
2011-08-10T12:21:55  <lukeis> XRayCulver: that was my assumption based on how java works

2011-08-10T12:22:37  <jimevans> lukeis: I misunderstood your statement earlier.
2011-08-10T12:22:49  <jimevans> yes, we're semantically equivalent to the Java implementation.
2011-08-10T12:22:51  <lukeis> jimevans: code examples are always clearer than english :)
2011-08-10T12:22:54  <XRayCulver> jimevans: thats what i thought, that will work

2011-08-10T13:02:35  <voodoofish1> hey guys, question on the example code on the selen site for chrome. Has anyone been able to get it working or is it just me?
2011-08-10T13:03:09  <lukeis> which example?

2011-08-10T13:15:58  <Parabola> i only ask becuse for no reason the remotewebdriver jsut stopped responding
2011-08-10T13:16:08  <Parabola> i have been running tests, they were working, they just stopped, no code changes
2011-08-10T13:16:24  <voodoofish1> okay, will try....
2011-08-10T13:16:26  <Parabola> i restarted the apps, no go
2011-08-10T13:16:31  <Parabola> now browser wont even launch
2011-08-10T13:16:52  <Parabola> no errors of course, just sit there, nothing in eclipse console either :(
2011-08-10T13:17:06  <Parabola> lmao
2011-08-10T13:17:12  <Parabola> i ctrl+c'ed on the node
2011-08-10T13:17:15  <Parabola> and then a browser launched
2011-08-10T13:17:49  <lukeis> hmm, i think i've seen some things stick like that sometimes... not often, when you get fully setup with grid i think it cleans that up for you
2011-08-10T13:18:05  <Parabola> what do you mean "fully setup"
2011-08-10T13:18:22  <lukeis> well, are you using grid now or just the standalone?
2011-08-10T13:18:37  <lukeis> maybe the case you ran into isn't handled...
2011-08-10T13:19:10  <lukeis> it tries to clean up browser sessions left open by tests not closing them properly before... but can take some time before it does
2011-08-10T13:19:37  <Parabola> i see
2011-08-10T13:19:56  <Parabola> I have no idea if i'm using grid or not, i dont know where the line is drawn between grid and remotewebdriver
2011-08-10T13:20:11  <Parabola> i am hitting the hub from my tests
2011-08-10T13:20:17  <Parabola> but they arent working
2011-08-10T13:20:25  <Parabola> they were 5 minutes ago though
2011-08-10T13:20:33  <lukeis> if you have a hub that you attach other standalone servers to, that's grid 2
2011-08-10T13:21:20  <lukeis> remote is when you connect directly to a standalone server that is on one machine only
2011-08-10T13:21:30  <Parabola> then yes i'm using grid
2011-08-10T13:21:38  <Parabola> i've got two instances on one VM, the hub and a node
2011-08-10T13:21:44  <Parabola> -role wd  for the node
2011-08-10T13:21:50  <Parabola> (i think thats what i'm supposed to be using)
2011-08-10T13:22:06  * lukeis doesn't remember the options off the top of my head
2011-08-10T13:22:29  <Parabola> me either
2011-08-10T13:22:38  <Parabola> theres only the two on the docs (That i saw anyway)

2011-08-10T13:23:49  <lukeis> -role webdriver   (or you were just shorthanding -role wd)
2011-08-10T13:25:04  <lukeis> ^ that btw is the one i think you should use as reference, what's the other one you saw?
2011-08-10T13:26:38  <Parabola> hmm
2011-08-10T13:26:50  <Parabola> when you register a node, isnt it supposed to show up on the hub console ?
2011-08-10T13:27:02  <lukeis> should, yes
2011-08-10T13:27:21  <Parabola> okay, so me hitting ctrl+c on the console for hub caused the node to "register"
2011-08-10T13:27:24  <Parabola> i see max sessions line now
2011-08-10T13:27:29  <Parabola> wtf is wrong with this
2011-08-10T13:27:32  <Parabola> i didnt change anything
2011-08-10T13:27:37  <lukeis> :-/
2011-08-10T13:28:04  <lukeis> i don't like the way this thing renders that smiley
2011-08-10T13:28:19  <Parabola> yeah, so 2 ctrl+c's on the hub console, and the node reged
2011-08-10T13:28:29  <Parabola> one ctrl+c on the node console, and my test is running
2011-08-10T13:28:32  <Parabola> wow this is pretty neat
2011-08-10T13:28:37  <lukeis> yikes...

2011-08-10T14:23:14  <voodoofish1> lukeis: I know that it's not in the correct location, which is why I tried the code on the other page as the info reltaed to pointing to a specific location doesn't make it very clear. From my searches, I've found a few different ways to do this, but I'm not sure what the best way to do it or the ideal way to do it.  :)
2011-08-10T14:23:40  <voodoofish1> one of the methods is to use a command like this. "java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/path/to/driver -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar"

2011-08-10T14:31:52  <lukeis> it's not spelled out directly in the docs... it just says "set the system property" ... left to you to figure out how to do it exactly ;)
2011-08-10T14:32:09  <voodoofish1> heheh...that it does...that so needs to be fixed!

2011-08-10T14:51:51  <zizazz_> hi, i am having an XPath problem writing a Selenium test. I created a simplified HTML page which illustrates the problem at  http://pastebin.com/RP1YdehB      I want to get the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. inner divs with XPath.   I can write //div[@class='outer'][1] or //div[@class='outer'][2]  to get the first or second outer div.  But //div[@class='inner'][1] returns all 4 inner divs instead of the first inner div, and //div[@class='inne
2011-08-10T14:53:57  <lukeis> zizazz_: do you want to get each inner individually? or as a list? are you using IDE RC or WebDriver?
2011-08-10T14:54:14  <zizazz_> I want to get each individually
2011-08-10T14:54:19  <zizazz_> I'm using Selenium IDE
2011-08-10T14:54:58  <lukeis> /div[@class='outer'][x]/div[@class='inner']
2011-08-10T14:55:03  <lukeis> replace x with 1,2,3,4
2011-08-10T14:55:12  <lukeis> start with "//"
2011-08-10T14:55:22  <lukeis> darn irc ;)
2011-08-10T14:55:55  <zizazz_> thank you!
2011-08-10T14:56:11  <zizazz_> why is it that //div[@class='inner'][2] won't work?
2011-08-10T14:56:19  <zizazz_> i have been reading tutorials on XPath but none of them make that clear to me
2011-08-10T14:57:44  <lukeis> because that would select the second inner that exists from your current context... so when it's root it then depends on browser implementation cause that is not defined... but I guess that to mean get me the second one where there appears to be two under one node
2011-08-10T14:58:23  <lukeis> i never use index when not defining the immediate parent node
2011-08-10T14:58:50  <zizazz_> ok let me see if i understand you correctly.    you are saying that my original approach won't work because each 'inner' div is in a different subtree of the DOM?
2011-08-10T14:59:34  <zizazz_> i'm not sure what "current context" or "root" means
2011-08-10T15:01:30  <lukeis> root is the top node of your DOM... html in this case. Context means which node you are currently on.  To be more accurate I think I would actually use in this case //body/div[@class='outer'][x]/div[@class='inner']
2011-08-10T15:01:34  *** cgoldberg has quit IRC
2011-08-10T15:01:45  <lukeis> "//" means any node
2011-08-10T15:01:52  <lukeis> below current one
2011-08-10T15:01:58  <lukeis> current is the root
2011-08-10T15:04:00  <lukeis> although i prefer css selectors :)
2011-08-10T15:05:08  <lukeis> "div.outer:nth-child(x) div.inner"
2011-08-10T15:06:07  <zizazz_> so do i understand correctly that the problem with //div[@class='inner'][2] is that it sets the context as  //div[@class='inner'] which is the first inner div and none of the other inner divs are siblings or children of that one?
2011-08-10T15:06:44  <lukeis> pretty much, yes
2011-08-10T15:06:55  <zizazz_> great, thank you.  i was puzzling over this one for hours
2011-08-10T15:07:58  <lukeis> but each browser may interpret that differently ;)
