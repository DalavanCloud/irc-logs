2011-07-01T00:15:22  <freynaud> good morning
2011-07-01T00:15:51  <barancev> morning, freynaud!
2011-07-01T00:16:15  <freynaud> anu
2011-07-01T00:16:33  <freynaud> anyone in there is managing a farm of mac OS VM ?
2011-07-01T00:19:54  <barancev> freynaud: look at the #1934, I've created a patch to remove temporary FF profile directory extracted from Capabilities (I'm not sure whether you are responsible for grid only or all remote-related issues, but you may pass it to the proper person)
2011-07-01T00:19:55  <selbot2>  open/needsclarification WebDriver is not deleting the profile directory after test exits - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1934
2011-07-01T00:21:04  <freynaud> thx
2011-07-01T00:21:23  <freynaud> eeshouldn't all that stuff have deleteOnExit already ?
2011-07-01T00:21:34  <freynaud> anyway I'll have a look, thx for the patch

2011-07-01T00:23:19  <barancev> freynaud: in this case there is no need to wait until exit, it is a temporary profile directory that can be removed immediately (it is copied while creating profile to be used for a new session)
2011-07-01T00:24:15  <freynaud> k
2011-07-01T00:24:17  <barancev> as for deleteOnExit - I don't thinkk it is a good idea to use in in grid, it can work for a long time without restarts
2011-07-01T00:24:41  <freynaud> barancev: i restart very often actually
2011-07-01T00:25:03  <freynaud> my assumption is that everything crash at some point, so I restart the node quite often
2011-07-01T00:25:52  <freynaud> the only part that stay on all the time in my current setup is the hub
2011-07-01T00:27:57  *** baijum has quit IRC
2011-07-01T00:28:03  <barancev> if you have hundreeds of tests - not a good idea to keep temp dirs until all tests finished, it is better to clean them as soon as possible

2011-07-01T00:30:58  <Mox[NL]> hey guys, is it a known "feature" that xpath expressions give different results in IE then FF ? For as far as I know I'm using the native Xpath.
2011-07-01T00:32:31  <Mox[NL]> it seems only to happen on expressions where I use "and"

2011-07-01T01:20:18  <krosenvold> Anyone know if there's any way to test a site with javascript disabled?
2011-07-01T01:21:08  <Mox[NL]> you can probably create a firefox profile where javascript is disabled
2011-07-01T01:21:25  <krosenvold> Does it work ;) ?
2011-07-01T01:21:33  <eranm> krosenvold, I think not :)
2011-07-01T01:21:37  <eranm> You could use the HtmlUnitDriver
2011-07-01T01:21:45  <eranm> which, by default, has js disabled

2011-07-01T07:23:38  <eranm> Good. I got native events working for Firefox 4 and 5 (on Linux, for a start), most of the changes to the rakefile and crazyfun were sane enough.
2011-07-01T07:23:44  <ato> jarib: Mainly things for getting the injected scripts from watir-webdriver working (escaping quotes properly).
2011-07-01T07:24:08  <eranm> One bit that doesn't work, though, is auto-downloading of the SDK - even though I'm adding a dependency on the relevant directory (third_party/gecko-5/linux, for example)
2011-07-01T07:24:21  <ato> jarib: We _are_ switching to using webdriver atoms, but that's not due until v0.6.

2011-07-01T07:31:18  <jarib> eranm: we should probably add a bitness check somewhere

2011-07-01T07:44:23  <jarib> it appears that after the cast error, the rest fails with        No response in a timely fashion.
2011-07-01T07:44:31  <eranm> barancev, have a look at com.thoughtworks.selenium.WebDriverSeleniumTestSuite
2011-07-01T07:44:35  <eranm> I believe that's what you're after.
2011-07-01T07:44:46  <ato> jarib: Is this with 11.5 final?
2011-07-01T07:44:58  <jarib> ah, no
2011-07-01T07:45:00  <jarib> 11.11
2011-07-01T07:45:13  <ato> I don't think 11.11 supports -autotestmode.
2011-07-01T07:45:19  <jarib> aha
2011-07-01T07:45:26  <ato> But you can still use it if you connect manually (at opera:debug).
2011-07-01T07:45:34  <ato> (See email from Stuk on selenium dev list recently.)
2011-07-01T07:45:49  <jarib> i'll try 10.5
2011-07-01T07:46:08  <ato> You might have greater luck with 11.5 (-:
2011-07-01T07:46:28  <ato> I've heard assorted reports of 11.5 being quite slow compared to our internal builds.

2011-07-01T07:49:41  <eranm> regarding issue 843, generic click at coordinates is not provided by the advanced interactions API
2011-07-01T07:49:42  <barancev> ato: API 1.0 has clickAt method, and it should be implemented using AUI API
2011-07-01T07:49:50  <eranm> but you could moveTo(offset) and then click()
2011-07-01T07:50:23  <barancev> new Actions(driver).moveToElement(element, xOffset, yOffset).click().build().perform();
2011-07-01T07:50:26  <ato> Aha, we're talking about Selenium 1 vs. 2 (with Advanced User Interactions) here.
2011-07-01T07:50:27  <eranm> But you want Selenium 1 clickAt to get x,y?
2011-07-01T07:51:52  <barancev> BTW, why perform() can't do build() automagically?

2011-07-01T09:10:35  <jimevans> i'm assuming that the reporter isn't actually on windows 7 with IE 6. :)
2011-07-01T09:11:16  <jleyba> I have the same problem with ie6 winxp
2011-07-01T09:12:41  <jimevans> I'm sure the problem is somewhere in the registry check for protected mode.
2011-07-01T09:12:42  <jarib> ato: should i expect the java tests to pass?
2011-07-01T09:12:48  <jrock20041> ato: nope still not working
2011-07-01T09:13:24  <jleyba> Hmm.. I enabled protected mode for all zones
2011-07-01T09:13:43  <jimevans> jleyba: not on windows xp/ie6 you didn't :)
2011-07-01T09:13:43  <jleyba> Applied the same .bat file for ie9 and it works fine there.. I actually only have this for ie6.  7-9 are working fine
2011-07-01T09:13:59  <jimevans> protected mode doesn't exist for xp at all.
2011-07-01T09:14:31  <jleyba> god i hate windows
2011-07-01T09:14:38  <jleyba> so there's a different set of registry changes i need to make for xp?
2011-07-01T09:14:43  <jimevans> none.
2011-07-01T09:15:35  <jleyba> then how would the protected mode checks be causing the problem?
2011-07-01T09:16:05  <jimevans> because we may be incorrectly detecting the version of IE or windows
2011-07-01T09:16:20  <jleyba> ah, gotcha

2011-07-01T09:16:26  <jleyba> Does the IE driver generate a log file?
2011-07-01T09:16:43  <jimevans> sadly, no.
2011-07-01T09:16:50  <jleyba> would be great if we could add that
2011-07-01T09:17:12  <jleyba> we added a /log servlet to the chromedriver.  sending a get request will return the contents of chromedriver.log
2011-07-01T09:17:21  <jleyba> pretty useful for remote debugging. would love to see that for IE :)
2011-07-01T09:17:54  <jimevans> i honestly have very little time to devote to webdriver until about the end of august.
2011-07-01T09:18:04  <jimevans> barely enough time for maintenance. i'll put it in the hopper though.
2011-07-01T09:18:53  <jrock20041> jleyba: what would this log tell you?
2011-07-01T09:20:23  <jrock20041> Would it have code errors or chrome errors?
2011-07-01T09:20:43  <jrock20041> If it is code error, testng has a logger that will tell that stuff
2011-07-01T09:21:47  <jleyba> jrock20041: it's all information about the chromedriver
2011-07-01T09:22:07  <jleyba> It can actually be pretty verbose, but it logs messages it sends to the browser, etc
2011-07-01T09:22:50  <jleyba> The chromedriver always generates chromedriver.log, so you can take a peek if you're curious (start chromedriver with the --verbose flag)
2011-07-01T09:23:49  <jimevans> jleyba: one quick thing to try: add a capability of ignoreProtectedModeSettings with a value of true to the desired capabilities of the driver. See if IE starts then.

2011-07-01T10:16:56  <jimevans> jarib: yeah, well it occurs to me that there's a *ton* of effort duplication for creating C++ implementations of the remote server
2011-07-01T10:17:26  <jarib> very true
2011-07-01T10:18:00  <jimevans> it'd be nice if there were a "reference implementation", but that requires a small bit of non-windows code.

2011-07-01T10:19:05  <jimevans> namely, I need to be able to convert from std::string to std::wstring and back again, preserving utf-8 encoding
2011-07-01T10:20:47  <jimevans> on Windows, this is accomplished using WideCharToMultiByte() and MultiByteToWideChar()
2011-07-01T10:21:22  <jimevans> however, I've no idea how to do it on any non-windows platform.
2011-07-01T10:21:35  <jarib> aha

2011-07-01T10:30:36  <jarib> looks like they're using icu
2011-07-01T10:31:19  <jimevans> apparently.
2011-07-01T10:31:23  <jarib> and it looks quite painful compared to the win functions
2011-07-01T10:32:28  <jimevans> yep. and MSVC gives you some really easy-to-use macros to make conversions even less painful.

2011-07-01T10:49:19  <andytinkham> jarib: Ultimately what I'm trying to solve is the case where selecting a value in one combo box makes a selection in another one. I can make a standard Wait until call, but was thinking that I'd seen a call that would automatically watch the second combo for the value change. I have no idea where I got that idea that that call exists. :)
2011-07-01T10:50:35  <andytinkham> It's non-existence is a good reason for me not finding it now though :)

2011-07-01T17:09:14  <cgp_> (selenium 1)
2011-07-01T17:09:24  <cgp_> but I can't seem to get it to start when I pass the custom path
2011-07-01T17:09:37  <cgp_> I've installed 3 versions of firefox, so starting them custom for me would be ideal
2011-07-01T17:10:47  <cgp_> trying double \ instead of \
2011-07-01T17:11:06  <cgp_> that was it
2011-07-01T17:11:10  <cgp_> all I had to do was ask ! :)
