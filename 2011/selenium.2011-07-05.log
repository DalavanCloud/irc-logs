2011-07-05T00:45:00  <pngl> It seems like clickElement and click use different mechanisms - one triggers a click event while the other simulate mouseclic. Is that correct? And if so, how should I decide which ot use?

2011-07-05T03:18:26  <Mayank> Hi, I have setup a explicit wait for an element like this in Java - http://pastebin.com/JUVzLsEn , (this is a similar implementation of what jarib showed me in Ruby - https://gist.github.com/1063770 . My code just keeps on waiting for the element to be found untill timeout, what am I missing on?
2011-07-05T03:19:17  <simonstewart> That looks like it should work
2011-07-05T03:19:27  <simonstewart> Dumb question: is the ID right?
2011-07-05T03:19:38  <Mayank> It just keeps waiting.
2011-07-05T03:19:40  <Mayank> yes it is
2011-07-05T03:19:56  <simonstewart> Which driver are you using?
2011-07-05T03:20:00  <simonstewart> IE?
2011-07-05T03:20:01  <Mayank> jarib's ruby code does not wait but finds it.
2011-07-05T03:20:07  <Mayank> IE and Firefox both
2011-07-05T03:20:12  <Mayank> does not work for any
2011-07-05T03:20:13  <angshu> @jarib, thanks that works. I am stuck on another such key event though .. which is for "CTRL+HOVER" over a WebElement. HOVER as in Mouse Hover
2011-07-05T03:20:15  <ato> Maybe you have a test case for us?

2011-07-05T06:26:22  <simonstewart> Wonder if we've got a race condition
2011-07-05T06:27:11  <jimevans> simonstewart: I was beginning to wonder the same thing. I was not getting consistent failures yesterday.
2011-07-05T06:27:50  <simonstewart> If that's the case, the obvious problem is in TemporaryFileSystem
2011-07-05T06:27:51  <jimevans> Incidentally, it looks like the selenium emulation test target rebuilds everything, even after it's been built once.
2011-07-05T06:27:57  <simonstewart> which is accessed in a synchronized block
2011-07-05T06:28:06  <simonstewart> jimevans: Yes. I'd noticed that
2011-07-05T06:28:18  <simonstewart> Looks to be doing that because the firefox_dll targets are being rebuilt
2011-07-05T06:28:36  <simonstewart> In fact, all the DLL targets are being rebuilt
2011-07-05T06:28:50  <simonstewart> Which causes everything else to join in the fun and games
2011-07-05T06:29:29  <jimevans> Yes, I was seeing cl.exe and link.exe appear in the process list, even after the DLLs had been built once.
2011-07-05T06:29:38  <simonstewart> The tests will also attempt to rebuild the artifacts that they need
2011-07-05T06:33:11  <simonstewart> Are the release dlls build with debugging info?

2011-07-05T06:43:01  <simonstewart> heh
2011-07-05T06:43:32  <freynaud> that will create plenty of issues. The resources are not in the right place for maven, and the pom will end up being way longer than the crazyfun files

2011-07-05T06:44:32  <simonstewart> Right. Doesn't look like an obvious race condition.
2011-07-05T06:45:02  <jimevans> Do we know where in the IE native code it's failing?
2011-07-05T06:45:04  <freynaud> simonstewart: can't you remove the poms ? I like maven, but it doesn't make selenium's build easy at all :)

2011-07-05T06:45:53  <simonstewart> They introduce more complexity that they actually solve
2011-07-05T06:46:16  <freynaud> can't we upload selenium-server-standalone to maven central ?
2011-07-05T06:46:29  <simonstewart> I dislike maven so much I've not investigated
2011-07-05T06:46:56  <freynaud> i don't see a huge value splitting in smaller jars. Maven will pull a lot anyway. Saving 10Mb won't change too much

2011-07-05T07:35:52  <simonstewart> "Access violation"
2011-07-05T07:35:56  <jimevans> Are you running with the native code from disk or extracted from the .jar?
2011-07-05T07:36:49  <jimevans> "Access Violation" is unfortunately one of those super-helpful error message, like "out of memory".
2011-07-05T07:36:54  <simonstewart> From the disk
2011-07-05T07:37:11  <jimevans> Yes, it can be descriptive, but it's worth foxtrot-alfa in debugging.
2011-07-05T07:37:28  <simonstewart> qq: why are we starting the IEDriver using JNA when it's almost entirely out of process?
2011-07-05T07:38:08  <jimevans> because i'm an idiot | lazy | lacking forethought. take your pick.
2011-07-05T07:38:23  <simonstewart> Just curious
2011-07-05T07:38:39  <jimevans> It should be a standalone executable.
2011-07-05T07:38:45  <simonstewart> When I last did some major hacking it was entirely in process
2011-07-05T07:38:46  <jimevans> I just never got around to fixing that.
2011-07-05T07:38:52  <simonstewart> So I've not got a leg stand on here :)
2011-07-05T07:39:04  <simonstewart> OK. I'm going to bump the version of jna we're using
2011-07-05T07:39:39  <jimevans> I keep thinking I'm going to get around to making it a standalone exe, but never seem to find the time.
2011-07-05T07:39:49  <simonstewart> No biggie
2011-07-05T07:39:58  <jimevans> Also, we'd run into the same packaging problems as chromedriver.exe w.r.t. antivirus scanners.
2011-07-05T07:40:04  <simonstewart> indeed
2011-07-05T07:40:31  <jimevans> it'd be Yet Another Executable the user has to have downloaded and available on the path.
2011-07-05T07:40:49  <jimevans> (which I'm not fundamentally opposed to, mind, it's just something to be aware of)
2011-07-05T07:41:56  <simonstewart> Right. Updating to JNA 3.3.0
2011-07-05T07:42:22  <simonstewart> Which was released on 8th June, 2011
2011-07-05T07:42:27  <simonstewart> So may well contain actual bug fixes

2011-07-05T07:43:39  <simonstewart> I'll keep on the crash

2011-07-05T07:45:32  <pngl> It seems like clickElement and click use different mechanisms - one triggers a click event while the other moves the mouse around clicks on at the element's location. Is that correct? And if so, how should I decide which one to use?

2011-07-05T07:51:16  <simonstewart> yeah
2011-07-05T07:52:15  <jimevans> I though mg_start was synchronous, at least to start processing requests.
2011-07-05T07:52:37  <simonstewart> Maybe

2011-07-05T07:55:30  <esto_> both are working

2011-07-05T07:56:20  <simonstewart> Hmmm....
2011-07-05T07:56:57  <simonstewart> OK, so the port is passed in.
2011-07-05T07:57:02  <jarib> esto_: switch to it, then get the title?

2011-07-05T08:22:49  <simonstewart> I put the code for starting the server in a synchronized block
2011-07-05T08:23:08  <simonstewart> It's not entirely clear why that should have made any difference

2011-07-05T08:36:03  <jimevans> I've not had a lot of success turning off the buffer overrun detection. It's a security "feature" in the OS.

2011-07-05T09:18:22  <jimevans> yeah, but it's a holdover from the NT3.1 days when they were actively trying to have a POSIX compliant OS.
2011-07-05T09:18:51  <jimevans> iow, it doesn't really work. :)
2011-07-05T09:18:57  <simonstewart> Fair enough
2011-07-05T09:20:26  <simonstewart> This just asked for permission to bind to a low port
2011-07-05T09:20:47  <simonstewart> OK. That looks like it's working
2011-07-05T09:20:56  <jimevans> incidentally, this is what I used for testing: https://gist.github.com/1065192
2011-07-05T09:21:24  <simonstewart> Why not just use that as the main method?
2011-07-05T09:21:34  <simonstewart> Looks far smarter than the hack I'm doing
2011-07-05T09:21:50  <simonstewart> What does "mg_start" do?
2011-07-05T09:22:01  <jimevans> mg_start starts the mongoose server.
2011-07-05T09:22:06  <simonstewart> Nice
2011-07-05T09:22:37  <jimevans> I've got a nice refactor that makes that a little cleaner.
2011-07-05T09:22:38  <simonstewart> And where on earth is event_handler initialized
2011-07-05T09:22:56  <jimevans> it's global. :( look in webdriver.cpp.
2011-07-05T09:23:40  <jimevans> this is all super-hacky because mongoose is a C component with C-style callbacks.
2011-07-05T09:23:57  <jimevans> Thus, you can't point C++ instance members to them.
2011-07-05T09:24:00  <dawagner> Oh wow, alerts are modal *across windows* in Chrome
2011-07-05T09:24:31  <simonstewart> Unless you use normal C name-mangling?
2011-07-05T09:24:53  <simonstewart> Sitting idle, dev env is eating 50% of my cpu time
2011-07-05T09:25:36  <jimevans> it's not the function name that's the problem; it's the signature.
2011-07-05T09:25:52  <jimevans> C++ methods have an implicit "this" pointer as their first parameter.

2011-07-05T09:30:42  <barancev|2> it is not no-op, it raises an exception
2011-07-05T09:31:00  <simonstewart> But I _think_ that clicks on a disabled element should be no-ops
2011-07-05T09:31:06  <jimevans> we say clicking on any other non-enabled element raises an exception.
2011-07-05T09:31:10  <simonstewart> It may be that we've not implemented it that way

2011-07-05T09:32:23  <simonstewart> Can you bring this up on the selenium-developers list
2011-07-05T09:32:33  <simonstewart> There are two conflicting points of view
2011-07-05T09:32:46  <AutomatedTester> I shall stir the pot first
2011-07-05T09:32:47  <simonstewart> 1) Normally when clicking a user wants something to happen. We should tell them why nothing happened
2011-07-05T09:32:59  <simonstewart> 2) clicks do nothing in reality, they should do nothing here
2011-07-05T09:33:07  <simonstewart> I suspect that we can handle the two cases like so:
2011-07-05T09:33:11  <simonstewart> 1) WebElement.click
2011-07-05T09:33:17  <simonstewart> 2) Actions.click();
2011-07-05T09:33:41  <simonstewart> That is: common case "we do what users expect", control-case, "we do what a user would do"
2011-07-05T09:34:26  <jarib> i think it's confusing that those two aren't the same
2011-07-05T09:34:31  <dawagner> I don't like divergence between semantically identical methods...
2011-07-05T09:34:45  <simonstewart> See: this is why we have a mailing list

2011-07-05T09:51:42  <simonstewart> Probably
2011-07-05T09:52:16  <jimevans> Yes. Particularly when the IE window doesn't have focus when you call the .click method.
2011-07-05T09:52:28  <jimevans> (though that's not the only time)
2011-07-05T09:53:36  <barancev|2> do we want rc test be geen with Opera and Chrome too?

2011-07-05T09:55:32  <jimevans> Because IE is using native events across a process boundary on Windows.

2011-07-05T09:56:53  <simonstewart> So, yes, it's waaaay better
2011-07-05T09:57:14  <barancev|2> simonstewart: I mean api 1.0 :)

2011-07-05T09:58:17  <selbot2> PaulHammant half a minute ago - upgrade jna version to be in line with earlier change to third_party change - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12751
2011-07-05T09:58:33  <simonstewart> I think I might be ripping out the last usages of jna
2011-07-05T09:59:40  <barancev|2> emulation for Opera is not much better than 1.0.3, more than half of all tests are failed :(
2011-07-05T10:00:12  <simonstewart> Is there an obvious cause?
2011-07-05T10:00:30  <simonstewart> Though I note that "not much better" with zero effort expended is pretty cool
2011-07-05T10:01:47  <simonstewart> jimevans any idea what the valid target types are for the csc_task?
2011-07-05T10:02:29  <rpk> last week there was some conversations regarding supporting another (headless I think) webkit based browser.  did anything come of that?  I'm not expecting htmlunit to work very well with gwt given the huge javascript dependency, and am getting comments consistent with that from other testers.
2011-07-05T10:03:06  <simonstewart> rpk: almost no-one has contributed to the headless webkit driver
2011-07-05T10:03:12  <barancev|2> a moment, I have to rerun Opera emu tests
2011-07-05T10:04:28  <simonstewart> Gah!
2011-07-05T10:04:34  <simonstewart> Why isn't this working?
2011-07-05T10:05:47  <rpk> simonstewart: so its being deferred at minimum?  Last week people were still talking about which webkit based browser to go with, capybara I think was one?
2011-07-05T10:08:32  <simonstewart> I don't think any of the core team are working on it
2011-07-05T10:08:54  <rpk> ok, thanks.
2011-07-05T10:09:31  <jimevans> simonstewart: why would you want to change the csc_task. that should only affect C#.
2011-07-05T10:10:01  <simonstewart> Well that's why it's not working

2011-07-05T10:15:03  <jimevans> dammit! this IE6 thing is really pissing me off.
2011-07-05T10:16:59  <simonstewart> What's up?
2011-07-05T10:17:26  <simonstewart> Is this "annoying because it's impossible to reproduce"?
2011-07-05T10:17:32  <jimevans> In my environment, IE6 starts up and looks to navigate to the startup page that we send down.
2011-07-05T10:17:41  <simonstewart> Are the protection domains different?
2011-07-05T10:17:52  <simonstewart> (does IE 6 even have that as a concept?)
2011-07-05T10:17:57  <jimevans> The mongoose server is sending the page, but IE never finishes rendering it.
2011-07-05T10:17:58  <barancev|2> go test_chrome is green (Win7 x64, chrome 13)
2011-07-05T10:18:16  <jimevans> No, Protected Mode is IE7+ on Vista+
2011-07-05T10:18:34  <simonstewart> barancev: that's good news :)
2011-07-05T10:19:17  <jimevans> I'm seeing IE launch, then just hang there, not rendering my (super simple) WebDriver startup page.

2011-07-05T10:26:51  <jimevans> dawagner: I've had no real problems with it. Remarkably stable. Just this problem that apparently only shows up in IE6.
2011-07-05T10:27:09  <CptPlastic> is bromine still supported or is the site down
2011-07-05T10:27:16  <simonstewart> And the buffer overflow thing
2011-07-05T10:27:24  <CptPlastic> its ok I was grumpy this morning

2011-07-05T10:27:39  <simonstewart> Have you tried the selenium-users list?"
2011-07-05T10:28:33  <CptPlastic> that's what I guessed I'm just trying to find a pretty way to report results
2011-07-05T10:28:35  *** tommost has joined #selenium
2011-07-05T10:29:33  <rpk> CptPlastic: you might want to look at tools that manage junit / testng / whatever you're using to write tests.
2011-07-05T10:29:57  <CptPlastic> soapui and loadui
2011-07-05T10:30:08  <jimevans> dawagner: well, mongoose is a little overkill for what we're using it for.
2011-07-05T10:30:26  <jimevans> ideally, I just need a cross-platform socket library and cross-platform http parser.
2011-07-05T10:30:27  <dawagner> That's fair :)
2011-07-05T10:30:37  <rpk> CptPlastic: you're writing Se tests in SoapUI?
2011-07-05T10:31:11  <jimevans> (preferrably written in C++ to avoid the utter kludge that is "calling C-style callbacks from C++")
2011-07-05T10:31:15  <barancev|2> ATM, Opera emulation tests just can't start the browser
2011-07-05T10:31:33  <simonstewart> Oh yeah

2011-07-05T10:32:04  <CptPlastic> no I'm not just another end of testing I'm using
2011-07-05T10:32:53  <barancev|2> simonstewart: yes, selectWindowWithTitle is raising an exception
2011-07-05T10:32:53  *** nitin_ has joined #selenium
2011-07-05T10:33:00  <barancev|2> how can I fix that?
2011-07-05T10:33:15  <CptPlastic> I just use the UI in FireFox but I have 100s of tests and run them via .bat
2011-07-05T10:33:17  <rpk> CptPlastic: you're going to (most likely) be using junit or testng to write your ui tests, using Selenium to drive the browser.  You'll have assertions there that validate output from Se driving the browser.  Tools that manage Junit or testng will work for putting together output.
2011-07-05T10:33:21  <barancev|2> is it a part of Opera driver or selenium emulation?
2011-07-05T10:33:49  <simonstewart> Opera driver
2011-07-05T10:34:02  <CptPlastic> that makes sense

2011-07-05T10:46:26  <simonstewart> (No wonder it hurt)
2011-07-05T10:46:43  <jimevans> You should receive a 404, but looking at the code, you won't.
2011-07-05T10:47:21  <simonstewart> What will happen?
2011-07-05T10:47:34  <jimevans> you'll get a 501 (Command Not Implemented). That's a bug.
2011-07-05T10:48:00  <simonstewart> OK. I can live with that, just so long as the server doesn't cave in completly
2011-07-05T10:48:29  <jimevans> shouldn't.
2011-07-05T10:49:24  <jimevans> the routine that does the request handling from the HTTP side is Server::ProcessRequest, which is in Server.cpp, around line 90 or so.
2011-07-05T10:49:33  <simonstewart> Thanks
2011-07-05T10:51:45  <tommost> I'm trying to debug an issue where the body of an HTTP DELETE request is dropped by Selenium Server rc3 when using the *googlechrome driver.
2011-07-05T10:51:53  <simonstewart> Hadanza!
2011-07-05T10:51:59  <simonstewart> A basic test just passed
2011-07-05T10:52:11  <jimevans> W00t!
2011-07-05T10:52:47  <tommost> I can't reproduce the issue in Firefox, and based on a Wireshark transcript it looks like Firefox doesn't proxy through Selenium Server.  Is this correct?
2011-07-05T10:53:01  <tommost> I'm not using the new WebDriver stuff.
2011-07-05T10:53:20  <simonstewart> No, it won't use the selenium server as a proxy unless you tell it
2011-07-05T10:53:35  <simonstewart> Indeed, you don't need the server process at all
2011-07-05T10:53:39  <simonstewart> on localhost
2011-07-05T10:53:45  <simonstewart> WebDriver is controlling the browser directly

2011-07-05T10:54:26  <simonstewart> Oh. Sorry
2011-07-05T10:54:43  <tommost> DELETE is implemented for XMLHttpRequst, just not <form>, AFAIK.
2011-07-05T10:54:49  <simonstewart> ok
2011-07-05T10:54:56  <simonstewart> has it ever worked?
2011-07-05T10:55:17  <tommost> Yeah, it works when performing the test manually in Chrome just fine.
2011-07-05T10:55:25  <tommost> Firefox works with and without Selenium.
2011-07-05T10:55:28  <simonstewart> has it ever worked through the proxy?
2011-07-05T10:55:43  <tommost> Nope.
2011-07-05T10:55:43  <simonstewart> OK. So google chrome is failing with the proxy in the way
2011-07-05T10:55:49  <tommost> Yeah.
2011-07-05T10:56:06  <tommost> So is this a known issue?  If not, I will report a bug.
2011-07-05T10:56:23  <simonstewart> Just to be clear: this has never worked via the proxy
2011-07-05T10:57:04  *** stepheneb_ has quit IRC
2011-07-05T10:57:12  <tommost> Yeah, if Firefox isn't using the proxy, and Chrome is using the proxy, then it is failing because of the proxy, which drops the body of the DELETE request.

2011-07-05T11:59:58  <jimevans> turns out the IE6 issue is in mongoose's keep-alive implementation.
2011-07-05T12:00:23  <simonstewart> Nasty
2011-07-05T12:00:27  <simonstewart> Very narty
2011-07-05T12:00:29  <simonstewart> nasty
2011-07-05T12:01:15  <jimevans> on the plus side, it's easy to fix in the ie driver.

2011-07-05T12:03:06  <jarib> jimevans: didn't i hear you talk about updating mongoose to a version that actually supports keep-alive?

2011-07-05T12:03:44  <jimevans> jarib: yeah, about 6 weeks ago. That change broke IE6.

2011-07-05T12:05:03  <elew> simonstewart: thanks!
2011-07-05T12:05:08  <jimevans> So disabling keep-alive in the IE driver for now.
2011-07-05T12:05:21  <simonstewart> Sounds reasonable to me

2011-07-05T12:21:50  <jimevans> The last major change made was the Protected Mode registry check, and I proved to myself that wasn't the problem under the debugger.
2011-07-05T12:22:11  <jimevans> next thing after that was the mongoose update. rolled back that change, and presto, it worked.
2011-07-05T12:22:52  <jimevans> I was trying to create a repro case for the mongoose devs when I hit the same behaviour for other IE versions.
2011-07-05T12:23:20  <jimevans> commenting out the keep-alive option in the options I was passing to mongoose solved it, and there we are.
2011-07-05T12:23:34  <simonstewart> nice
2011-07-05T12:23:37  <simonstewart> good job :)

2011-07-05T13:38:23  <samit> why is there a before :all as well as a before :each
2011-07-05T13:38:39  <rpk> freynaud: will the grid error where you get "cannot find : {platform=WINDOWS, ensureCleanSession=true, browserName=internet explorer, version=}" be fixed, or no?
2011-07-05T13:39:27  <freynaud> rpk: it's not an error, the desired capability matchi,g is case sensitive
2011-07-05T13:39:57  <rpk> yes, but wouldn't that mean the default node json file is wrong?
2011-07-05T13:40:05  <samit> jarib: getTitle -> title done!
2011-07-05T13:40:33  <samit> jarib: can I move code to before:each and remove the before:all?
2011-07-05T13:40:40  <jarib> samit: before(:all) runs once per file, before(:each) runs before each example (i.e. the   it "test name" do ... end   blocks)
2011-07-05T13:40:58  <jarib> yes
2011-07-05T13:41:14  <jarib> also, append_after should just be after(:each)
2011-07-05T13:41:20  <rpk> freynaud ^^^^: running everything with defaults on latest build, using defaulthub and defaultnode, targeting DesiredCapabilities.internetExplorer()
2011-07-05T13:42:04  <samit> jarib: so the current code would give errors due to the @verification_errors not initialised before every example!

2011-07-05T13:46:22  <freynaud> rpk: can you file an issue for this windows problem ?
2011-07-05T13:46:28  <jarib> the method creates its own scope, so you can just put the rescue in the method directly

2011-07-05T13:51:49  <jarib> andytinkham: you can just have rescue and ensure
2011-07-05T13:52:03  <jarib> basically the method definition takes care of the begin/end
2011-07-05T13:52:46  <jarib> samit: you could also do this to avoid all those verification rescues: https://gist.github.com/1065924
2011-07-05T13:53:17  <andytinkham> jarib: So are there any situations where you need the begin/end? Maybe if the begin isn't the first line or the end isn't the last line in a function?
2011-07-05T13:53:31  <jarib> right
2011-07-05T13:53:52  <jarib> a good indication that it should perhaps be extracted to a method :)
2011-07-05T13:54:32  <samit> jarib: or perhaps with: verify {@driver.find_element(:id, "text5").attribute("style")).should == "visibility: hidden;"}
2011-07-05T13:54:50  <andytinkham> :) Yeah, I can see that (I only have 1 place where I still need the begin/end as written now, and yeah, it should be extracted out :) )

2011-07-05T13:57:31  <cam> i just started writing some test, using the WebDriver
2011-07-05T13:57:51  <cam> and i was wondering if anyone had trouble getting their test cases to run in both firefox and internet explorer

2011-07-05T14:00:32  <jimevans> what's working in Firefox that isn't working in IE?
2011-07-05T14:01:02  <cam> alright for example....   domSelector = By.linkText("Sample Life Insurance Policies");
2011-07-05T14:01:26  <cam> that should wokr, as I got that from the Selenium IDE
2011-07-05T14:01:49  <cam> ill find the java exception thrown in a second
2011-07-05T14:01:59  <cam> but i have links which im basically just trying to click

2011-07-05T14:02:59  <jimevans> Okay, let me make sure I understand what exactly is working and what isn't.
2011-07-05T14:03:00  <jarib> cam: it's hard for us to help unless you provide the full HTML page
2011-07-05T14:03:21  <jarib> cam: i could easily write an example that shows By.linkText("Sample Life Insurance Policies"); working fine in IE
2011-07-05T14:03:25  <jimevans> It sounds like you're able to locate the element alright, but that an element click() is not working like you expect.
2011-07-05T14:04:04  <samit> cam: how did you get that from the IDE?

2011-07-05T14:28:06  <samit> andytinkham: btw, which app did you use? I am thinking of getting one for mine as well.

2011-07-05T14:28:52  <andytinkham> samit: I use iThoughtsHD. The dev has done a great job with it. It has Dropbox support and exports to the formats used by a lot of desktop mind managers, plus has a lot of decent functionality on the iPad.
2011-07-05T14:29:25  <samit> andytinkham: thanks, will check it out.
2011-07-05T14:29:26  <andytinkham> samit: I'm actually to the point where I use my iPad for that sort of thing even when I'm sitting at my desk with my laptop (and FreeMind) available, then export to Dropbox to get the map on my machine

2011-07-05T15:00:17  <cam> hey guys
2011-07-05T15:00:57  <cam> is there a way to select a given option from a <Select> using webDriver.findElement(By...)
2011-07-05T15:01:15  *** QAguy has quit IRC
2011-07-05T15:01:43  <jimevans> nominally, the answer is execute another findElement() to get the <option> you want, and click it.
2011-07-05T15:01:56  <cam> ohh
2011-07-05T15:01:58  <cam> you can do that?
2011-07-05T15:02:15  <cam> WebElement = get the select element
2011-07-05T15:02:19  <jimevans> however, there's a Select class in the support jar that does a lot of the handling of selecting items from a <select> for you.
2011-07-05T15:02:43  <cam> oh i didn't know there was a class
2011-07-05T15:02:51  <jimevans> s/support jar/support classes/
2011-07-05T15:03:02  <cam> but in theory, i could get the select element
2011-07-05T15:03:11  <cam> then reference that element and do another find element?
2011-07-05T15:03:24  <jimevans> yep. element1.findElement(By...)
2011-07-05T15:03:39  <cam> that sounds easier
2011-07-05T15:03:40  <cam> thanks
2011-07-05T15:04:11  <cam> question is, will that work in IE as well ....i guess i will find out
2011-07-05T15:04:28  <jimevans> that will work in IE.
2011-07-05T15:05:13  *** ksutardji has quit IRC
2011-07-05T15:05:21  <cam> ive had the oddest problems with InternetExplorerDriver
2011-07-05T15:05:30  <cam> especially when in the debugger
2011-07-05T15:05:53  <jimevans> IE has challenges with clicking on elements when the IE window isn't the focus.
2011-07-05T15:05:54  <cam> for example, selecting the WebElement, and then performing a click on it while stepping through the code
2011-07-05T15:06:00  <cam> ohhh
2011-07-05T15:06:06  <cam> i had no idea
2011-07-05T15:06:23  <jimevans> The reason is the way we do element clicks.
2011-07-05T15:06:50  <jimevans> We use the Windows SendMessage API to simulate keyboard and mouse input.
2011-07-05T15:07:14  <jimevans> And if you try to use that API cross-process, it's not reliable.
2011-07-05T15:07:24  <cam> oh...well whatever that is, it's a bit over my head at this point
2011-07-05T15:07:31  <cam> hehe
2011-07-05T15:07:31  <jimevans> sorry, not 100% reliable.
2011-07-05T15:09:24  <cam> hmmm
2011-07-05T15:09:42  <cam> so concerncing selecting the OPTION
2011-07-05T15:09:50  <jimevans> options are a special case.
2011-07-05T15:10:06  <cam> i have the select element selected, how the heck do you reference the right option?
2011-07-05T15:10:08  <cam> as its a value
2011-07-05T15:10:13  <cam> would that be an xpath selector?
2011-07-05T15:10:27  <jimevans> that's why you want to use the Select class. It has all those methods for you.
2011-07-05T15:10:43  *** ksutardji has joined #selenium
2011-07-05T15:11:15  <jimevans> including selectByIndex(), selectByValue() and selectByVisibleText()
2011-07-05T15:11:54  <tommost> So... fun times.  Apparently the Java HTTP routines don't allow a message-body on DELETE requests, which is wrong.
2011-07-05T15:12:10  <tommost> I've added a comment to the bug to that effect.  Good luck fixing it.
2011-07-05T15:12:11  <cam> okay thanks again
2011-07-05T15:12:17  <cam> going to now investigate that select class
2011-07-05T15:12:18  <cam> hehe
2011-07-05T15:16:22  <jimevans> not being a java guy, does anybody know if junit redirects System.out?
