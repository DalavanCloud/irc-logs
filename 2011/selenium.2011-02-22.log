2011-02-22T00:20:04  <simonstewart> G'day all
2011-02-22T00:20:24  <jarib> hey
2011-02-22T00:20:49  <simonstewart> hej, perhaps?
2011-02-22T00:20:52  <jarib> hei
2011-02-22T00:21:00  <simonstewart> hai!
2011-02-22T00:21:01  <jarib> hej is swedish
2011-02-22T00:21:16  <selbot2> simon.m.stewart half a minute ago - SimonStewart: Fix an obvious problem with the get attribute method's fallback - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11510
2011-02-22T00:21:21  <simonstewart> Wondered how close Norwegian and Swedish were
2011-02-22T00:21:49  <jarib> pretty close, we can all understand each other if we talk slowly
2011-02-22T00:22:12  <jarib> that includes danish as well, but they have to talk *really* slow for anyone to understand them
2011-02-22T00:23:16  <jarib> danish is becoming less and less articulated - it's at a point now where speech development in children is actually proven slower in denmark than in norway/sweden
2011-02-22T00:23:40  <simonstewart> wow
2011-02-22T00:24:18  <jarib> yeah, pretty crazy
2011-02-22T00:25:22  <jarib> simonstewart: do you know in what cases the reflection in CommandLine.canExecute will fail?
2011-02-22T00:25:29  <jarib> Java 5?
2011-02-22T00:25:47  <eranm> Yes, Java 5
2011-02-22T00:25:56  <eranm> simonstewart, when are you back from Tokyo? Friday?
2011-02-22T00:27:48  <jarib> eranm: it appears to fail on the  bamboo linux vm as well, which is definitely running java 6
2011-02-22T00:28:20  <jarib> failing as in the method returning true for non-existing files, for example
2011-02-22T00:28:40  <eranm> But the reflection itself passes, I take it?
2011-02-22T00:29:11  <jarib> i don't know
2011-02-22T00:30:22  <jarib> i haven't checked whether it successfully invokes the method or drops down to the last "return true"
2011-02-22T00:30:39  <jarib> i just added the top guard there
2011-02-22T00:31:39  <jarib> now it's able to find firefox, but i have a bunch of failing tests that are passing locally (RC-client)
2011-02-22T00:32:36  <jarib> so wondered if it could be related
2011-02-22T00:32:56  <eranm> Not sure. Let me check what's using this call
2011-02-22T00:33:13  <jarib> i don't really get how they use isWritable to check if a file is executable
2011-02-22T00:36:47  <jarib> setWritable i mean
2011-02-22T00:37:47  <eranm> It doesn't look right, I agree
2011-02-22T00:38:01  <jarib> i guess that implies exists() && !directory()
2011-02-22T00:38:14  <eranm> A directory can be writable
2011-02-22T00:43:41  <jarib> ok, so it's a permissions check
2011-02-22T00:44:13  <simonstewart> I fly back on Friday. should be in the office on Monday
2011-02-22T00:44:49  <simonstewart> jarib: the reflection in command line only works on Java 6 and above
2011-02-22T00:45:17  <simonstewart> cos that's when the method got added
2011-02-22T00:45:57  <eranm> simonstewart, the code clearly documents that. What the code doesn't document is why we call setWriteable to check if a file is executable
2011-02-22T00:48:43  <simonstewart> Looks like the "canExecute" method was added to File in JDK6. Looks like a thinko in the command line class
2011-02-22T00:50:13  <simonstewart> I'll fix it up now
2011-02-22T00:50:23  <simonstewart> And by "now" I mean "once the tests are complete"

2011-02-22T06:10:43  <eranm> jarib, assuming you're using an Ubuntu / Debian machine you can apt-get install ia32-libs
2011-02-22T06:10:53  <eranm> which provides a bunch of libraries for backwards compatibility with 32 bit programs
2011-02-22T06:11:31  <eranm> The biggest hurdle is getting all of the native components on Linux to support 32 bit and 64 bit (64 bit firefox being the unofficial one shipped with Ubuntu / Debian)

2011-02-22T06:15:37  <eranm> I haven't yet fully thought about how to solve this - Perhaps using the process's PID to make sure the file is unique
2011-02-22T06:16:12  <eranm> But then I'd have to add to the native events library another call, to get the process's pid
2011-02-22T06:16:30  <eranm> since I don't believe there's any interface in xpcom that exposes that :)

2011-02-22T08:03:20  <csgeekAlterEgo> I'm using a Grid setup for selenium and using the capture_entire_page_screenshot function, but my issue with that is that its being saved on the remote server, rather then pulling it to the hub machine
2011-02-22T08:03:41  <csgeekAlterEgo> is there a way of pulling the screenshot over to the hub, and saving it to a particular location?
2011-02-22T08:04:02  <AutomatedTester> csgeekAlterEgo: use the to_string method and then save it to on the hub
2011-02-22T08:05:59  <csgeekAlterEgo> AutomatedTester: okay.. thanks AutomatedTester

2011-02-22T08:47:12  <csgeekAlterEgo> another silly question.  Sometimes my code dies out and it leaves a Firefox open on the remote server.  Is there a command I can send via the hub to shut down all outstanding remotes?

2011-02-22T08:54:01  <skiphuffman> Though for me it is mostly when I hit certificate issues and the browsers just decide to sit there stupidly instead of timing out.
2011-02-22T08:55:20  <AutomatedTester> csgeekAlterEgo: The grid *should* kill orphaned browsers
2011-02-22T08:55:37  <csgeekAlterEgo> I mean.. I don't mind if test code breaks.. that happens.. but I'd like the ability to just start a new test with a "re-init" basically kill all open session on hub

2011-02-22T08:56:09  <csgeekAlterEgo> AutomatedTester: do you know if there's just a timeout that it waits before killing them?
2011-02-22T08:56:21  <skiphuffman> And can we adjust that timeout.
2011-02-22T08:56:40  <AutomatedTester> csgeekAlterEgo: there is a timeout and I believe you can change it in the ant script

2011-02-22T10:09:14  <KirillJacobson> To jimevans: what version of ie do you have? I am gettiing consistent get_parent failures on IE8. It always works for the first time and never works for the second. I have noticed that LunchBrowserProcess starts two instances of iexplorer. The closest on the internet is a comment on the msdn site for the IELunchURL function. It says that returned PID can be wrong. Any thoughts?
2011-02-22T10:11:54  <jimevans> KirillJacobson: I'm using IE8. I've read the comment on the documentation page, and EricLaw's response indicates exactly wich PID is returned.
2011-02-22T10:12:12  <jimevans> The PID returned by IELaunchURL is the one we want.
2011-02-22T10:12:41  <jimevans> How does LaunchBrowserProcess start two instances of Internet Explorer? Do you see two windows launch, or are you looking at the process list?

2011-02-22T10:25:06  <AutomatedTester> fission6: I would ask a java person for more insight into that

2011-02-22T10:27:13  <eranm> Except I'm on my way out. fission6 : try specifying DesiredCapabilities.htmlUnitWithJavascript() when creating it through the remote server.
2011-02-22T10:27:41  <fission6> ill try though by default i think that happens
2011-02-22T10:27:44  <eranm> (I assume RC means the remote server containing Selenium 2 and no Selenium 1 is involved)
2011-02-22T10:27:47  <fission6> ill review when you and Auto are back online
2011-02-22T10:27:50  <fission6> right
2011-02-22T10:28:03  <eranm> fission6, can you quickly put your initialization code in pastebin?
2011-02-22T10:28:09  <KirillJacobson> To jimevans: I am printing out a process list before and after starting the browser process. I see only one browser window. The hwnd handle found by enum function is the one that belongs to the visible browser but get parent fails. Two iexplore processes and single browser window hang around even after i i kill the test process after the GPE
2011-02-22T10:28:28  <fission6> i can wait until you get back no rush
2011-02-22T10:28:38  <eranm> That will be tomorrow :)
2011-02-22T10:28:42  <fission6> oh
2011-02-22T10:28:46  <fission6> wellhere is th emain line
2011-02-22T10:28:54  <fission6> webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities=webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.HTMLUNIT)
2011-02-22T10:29:05  <eranm> Right
2011-02-22T10:29:20  <fission6> i can wait until otmorrow i need to gather my thoughts
2011-02-22T10:29:34  <jimevans> KirillJacobson: That's a consequence of "loosely-coupled IE". In IE7, you had a broker process ieuser.exe that would be launched in addition to iexplore.exe.
2011-02-22T10:29:35  <eranm> Which language binding is that?
2011-02-22T10:30:25  <jimevans> KirillJacobson: In IE8, those capabilities were folded into iexplore.exe. So when you launch IE8, you *always* have at least two iexplore.exe processes.
2011-02-22T10:30:38  <jimevans> Try it manually, and you'll see the same thing.
2011-02-22T10:30:55  <eranm> Gotta go - but the reason I found for different behaviour  of WebDriver with HtmlUnit on remote / locally is the browser type - findElementByPartialLinkText, for example, would fail.
2011-02-22T10:31:14  <eranm> Have a look at the DesiredCapabilities in Java and send the exact same thing - and it should work.
2011-02-22T10:31:15  <eranm> Cheers.

2011-02-22T10:38:34  <KirillJacobson> To jimevans: have another question. How to tell the build to build iedriver instead of picking it up from prebuilt folder? Now I build from vs, custom build step copies the file to prebuilt, i run go selenium-java and then ie:test:run. I wonder if there is an wasier way
2011-02-22T10:40:22  <jimevans> KirillJacobson: I know very little about building the Java language bindings. The .NET bindings are constructed such that we look first for IEDriver.dll in the same directory as WebDriver.IE.dll, and if it's there, we use it.

2011-02-22T11:12:52  <JuanDaugherty> AT: I wish IE was somebody (else's) nightmare. Fortunately I seldom have to use it.
2011-02-22T11:13:31  <jimevans> JuanDaugherty: I wish IE was somebody else's nightmare too.
2011-02-22T11:13:43  <JuanDaugherty> maybe in another 30 years MS will be outta biz like IBM ... oh wait
2011-02-22T11:14:24  <JuanDaugherty> (meant "nightmare" as opposed to "real browser")
2011-02-22T11:15:49  <JuanDaugherty> IBM is doing OK but if they had maintained their stature relative to the industry they'd be lika half trillion plus per year biz now
2011-02-22T11:17:17  <jimevans> JuanDaugherty: I wouldn't wish Microsoft away; the company has been very good to me. I'd just like a little support and the occasional code review or contribution from the IE team.
2011-02-22T11:17:47  <JuanDaugherty> I feel the same about IBM, but I think it's more justified in my case.
2011-02-22T11:18:16  <jimevans> how so?
2011-02-22T11:18:41  <JuanDaugherty> their both standard form capital enterprises though, and what made IBM IBM (i.e. the ethos T.J. Watson created ceased to operate a long time ago

2011-02-22T11:21:52  <JuanDaugherty> T.J Watson Sr. that is. Reportedly he established the respect for the IBMer as the hallmark of the company as a result of his treatment at NCR
