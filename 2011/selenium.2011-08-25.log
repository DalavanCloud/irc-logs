2011-08-25T02:33:21  <eranm> AutomatedTester, when Firefox finds there's a newer version it could update to, does it update automatically (Chrome style) or does it leave the choice to the user?

2011-08-25T02:36:20  <eranm> AutomatedTester, the reason behind this question is that we make different versions of Firefox available internally for testing with WebDriver. I think it's senseless to distinguish between versions 4,5,6 and 7,8 when those are released, if users have to upgrade anyway

2011-08-25T03:54:02  <Fry33> For upload in Selenium RC was attacheFile and no tools to download file and check that is expected file. So Se2 has something for this?
2011-08-25T03:58:11  <jarib> Fry33: for <input type=file>, you can use WebElement.sendKeys. there's nothing in the main API to download files to disk, but there are ways to configure the browser to automatically download some file types to a given folder (at least for Firefox and Chrome)
2011-08-25T03:59:13  <Fry33>  for <input type=file>, you can use WebElement.sendKeys. <--- this will not work with grid.
2011-08-25T03:59:15  *** jeffery has joined #selenium
2011-08-25T04:00:00  <Fry33> because browser where should be file uploaded and file to upload will be on the separated machines.

2011-08-25T05:22:22  <djonsson> that is the entire test. click a submit button. when I do the test in Selenium IDE i get an error saying "please enter your login details", as soon as I start the Selenium Server the test fails.
2011-08-25T05:22:29  <RossPatterson> djsonsson: I don't know the PHP bindings for RC, but that looks OK to me.
2011-08-25T05:23:26  *** Fry33 has quit IRC
2011-08-25T05:23:49  <djonsson> yeah, the problem is that as soon as the selenium server is running in the background the button become unresponsive, even without running the actual test case (me manually pressing the button).

2011-08-25T05:25:45  <RossPatterson> Hang on ... where does your test open a page to start on?  I don't see any code like "selenium.open(url)".
2011-08-25T05:25:58  *** jrock20041 has quit IRC
2011-08-25T05:26:31  <djonsson> actually the test also has a     $this->open("/");
2011-08-25T05:26:46  <RossPatterson> For example, http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.5/en/selenium.html says:

2011-08-25T07:59:11  <ato> Stuk and I are working on making OperaDriver Grid-compatible now.  Unfortunately it requires a few changes to the browser itself.

2011-08-25T07:59:56  <AutomatedTester> watch this space really

2011-08-25T08:02:18  <ato> tyrtyutjg: Currently, yes.
2011-08-25T08:02:23  <AutomatedTester> not sure, ato works at Opera so is the best person to answer
2011-08-25T08:02:32  <tyrtyutjg> so If I run an Firefox I cannot run IE later
2011-08-25T08:02:34  <tyrtyutjg> ?
2011-08-25T08:02:54  <AutomatedTester> i am sure that you can
2011-08-25T08:03:37  <AutomatedTester> freynaud: can you maybe field that question
2011-08-25T08:03:44  <AutomatedTester> I can't see why there would be that limitation
2011-08-25T08:03:56  <AutomatedTester> since everything gets a unique session ID
2011-08-25T08:04:12  <freynaud> AutomatedTester: what's the uestion ?
2011-08-25T08:04:13  <AutomatedTester> so if the browser can handle properly creating multiple sessions then it should be fine

2011-08-25T08:04:22  <AutomatedTester> so If I run an Firefox I cannot run IE later
2011-08-25T08:04:32  <tyrtyutjg> ato: so what do you mean one browser per node?
2011-08-25T08:04:55  <AutomatedTester> so IE can only really have 1 operation IE at a time because they dont have the profiles concept
2011-08-25T08:05:38  <tyrtyutjg> Oh so you mean browser instances?
2011-08-25T08:05:48  <AutomatedTester> yes
2011-08-25T08:06:06  <AutomatedTester> you can have multiple browsers on a node
2011-08-25T08:06:14  <AutomatedTester> if the OS and browsers can handle it

2011-08-25T08:09:33  <amitev> i have a flash button on the page is there a way to click on it using selenium?
2011-08-25T08:09:42  <freynaud> tyrtyutjg: there is no 1 browser per instance limitation
2011-08-25T08:09:53  <freynaud> tyrtyutjg: you define that by configuration
2011-08-25T08:10:35  <tyrtyutjg> freynaud: ato sad: see 17:13
2011-08-25T08:11:21  <freynaud> tyrtyutjg: my guess is that you can run at least 1 opera
2011-08-25T08:11:23  <freynaud> http://www.google.com/codesearch#2tHw6m3DZzo/trunk/java/server/src/org/openqa/grid/common/defaults/DefaultNode.json
2011-08-25T08:11:41  <freynaud> add opera in there and maxInstance=1
2011-08-25T08:11:42  <ato> Things remaining before Grid is supported on Opera: (1) port probing for launcher, (2) port probing for Opera, (3) -debugproxy flag for Opera, (4) -pd flag for Opera.
2011-08-25T08:11:44  <freynaud> that's what I do
2011-08-25T08:12:38  <freynaud> ato: I'd like to add support for flags to be able to use capabilities to specify the X display
2011-08-25T08:12:54  <freynaud> last time I checked the logic was there, but not the capability wrapper
2011-08-25T08:13:00  <grahamm> anyone got any thought on this grid error "Error, header should contain Location"
2011-08-25T08:13:17  <ato> freynaud: We've added that in OperaDriver HEAD, so it'll be in the next version.
2011-08-25T08:13:19  <grahamm> i've only started getting it since going to 2.5
2011-08-25T08:13:30  <freynaud> grahamm: you get that when the browser didn't start properly
2011-08-25T08:13:44  <freynaud> i suspect you'll have some stacktrace in the node log
2011-08-25T08:13:47  <ato> freynaud: We're moving all the OperaDriverSettings stuff over to DesiredCapabilities + simplifying it a bit.
2011-08-25T08:14:01  <freynaud> ato: cool stuff
2011-08-25T08:14:06  <tyrtyutjg> freynaud: I was told Opera + Grid + webdriver = not working
2011-08-25T08:14:07  <grahamm> ah hah, thats interesting as I can see the firefox instance come up, i'll look at that further though
2011-08-25T08:14:51  <freynaud> tyrtyutjg: i did a poc some time ago, it kind of worked. If it works with remote webdriver, it works with grid
2011-08-25T08:15:18  <ato> tyrtyutjg: I said Opera doesn't really support Grid, in the sense that it doesn't support parallelization, and that you're currently limited to one browser per machine.
2011-08-25T08:15:23  <tyrtyutjg> freynaud: is it included in 2.4?
2011-08-25T08:15:43  <tyrtyutjg> oh
2011-08-25T08:15:46  <ato> tyrtyutjg: But of course, if you limit to one instance, you should be fine.
2011-08-25T08:15:52  <freynaud> tyrtyutjg: there is no need to include anything, grid doesn't need to know anything about opera
2011-08-25T08:16:06  <ato> Opera is supported in Selenium 2.0+.
2011-08-25T08:16:07  <tyrtyutjg> i see
2011-08-25T08:16:52  <freynaud> ato: is opera profile automatically reset now after a test ?
2011-08-25T08:17:00  <ato> No.
2011-08-25T08:17:07  <ato> But it's running on a separate profile.
2011-08-25T08:17:23  <tyrtyutjg> ato: it would be nice if I could set up proxy for various browsers
2011-08-25T08:17:26  <freynaud> ato: is that profile reset between two runs ?
2011-08-25T08:17:34  <ato> freynaud: Nope, not currently.
2011-08-25T08:17:50  *** Mayank has joined #selenium
2011-08-25T08:17:54  <freynaud> ato: as soon as it is, we can add opera in the default grid setup
2011-08-25T08:18:08  <freynaud> ato: before, it will create too much confusion
2011-08-25T08:18:37  <ato> freynaud: It will be when we get the -pd flag for Opera.  That will allow us to tell Opera either to create a random directory, or specify an existing profile to use.
2011-08-25T08:18:53  <ato> freynaud: I'm guessing that it will be in Opera 12.
2011-08-25T08:19:40  <freynaud> ato: what about wiping out the test directory before starting a test ?
2011-08-25T08:21:17  <ato> That will create problems for the tests the Desktop department are running, because they require the profile to be maintained between starting and stopping Opera.

2011-08-25T08:40:13  <freynaud> you can specify a different config json file when you launch the node, or use the param -browser
2011-08-25T08:40:23  <freynaud> i prefer the json file, less typing
2011-08-25T08:40:31  <tyrtyutjg> hm...

2011-08-25T08:55:18  <ebass> thats fine

2011-08-25T10:00:22  <jimevans> what's your question?
2011-08-25T10:04:32  <Freq18hz> basically, I've got a test case that I prototyped in the IDE, that hits a web address, then logs into the page.  When the login function runs, it clicks the login link, and procedes to fill in username, password fields.  When I run the same exact test exported to python though with the webdriver, the test will not proceed after clicking the login link, and never gets to filling out the password.  I'm trying to figure out why it doesn't seem to be able to
2011-08-25T10:04:39  <Freq18hz> http://paste.ofcode.org/SS7keEz96hRknETUR8scBx
2011-08-25T10:05:30  <Freq18hz> It works fine in the IDE, but not in the webdriver.
2011-08-25T10:07:26  <RossPatterson> I'm more Selenium RC than WebDriver, but that sounds like the page never finishes loading.
2011-08-25T10:07:29  <BenGrailsGuy> does anyone know an easy way to take snapshots whenever there's a failure in my test? (webDriver)
2011-08-25T10:07:41  <jimevans> bear in mind i'm not a python expert, but what errors are you receiving?
2011-08-25T10:07:48  <ruel> @bengrails, screenshots?
2011-08-25T10:08:14  <Freq18hz> so is webdriver super buggy?  Should I be trying to use selenium RC instead?

2011-08-25T10:19:17  <lukeis> Freq18hz:  I just tried it... your login is in a frame, you need to add driver.switch_to_frame(driver.find_element_by_id("secure-iframe-overlay"))  before you find the login field
2011-08-25T10:19:37  <Freq18hz> how did you figure that out?

2011-08-25T10:29:17  <simonstewart> Thanks :)
2011-08-25T10:29:47  <simonstewart> Somewhere there "RemoteProxy.getNewSession"
2011-08-25T10:30:00  <freynaud> do you want how the node starts
2011-08-25T10:30:07  <freynaud> or how the proxy is done on the hub ?
2011-08-25T10:30:08  <lukeis> tyrtyutjg: use webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.INTERNETEXPLORER  instead of your desired_capabilites

2011-08-25T10:31:54  <simonstewart> Yup
2011-08-25T10:32:06  <simonstewart> startRemoteServer?
2011-08-25T10:32:14  <nirvdrum> simonstewart: I suspect it's related to some of the concurrency issues krosenvold_ raised.
2011-08-25T10:32:23  <freynaud> simonstewart: yes
2011-08-25T10:32:43  <simonstewart> nirvdrum: the other thing that I'm thinking is that it's a weird networking issue
2011-08-25T10:33:00  <simonstewart> The firefox instance is starting and then just opening a window and hanging
2011-08-25T10:33:04  <freynaud> simonstewart: SelfRegisteringRemote has a normal SeleniumServer
2011-08-25T10:33:10  <nirvdrum> simonstewart: I could agree with that.  I think somehow responses are either getting dropped or routed incorrectly.
2011-08-25T10:33:13  <simonstewart> Which implies that the startUrl is All Wrong
2011-08-25T10:34:00  <simonstewart> OK. So it sounds like I need to dig into how RC picks the local server URL
2011-08-25T10:34:10  <simonstewart> And maybe switch it to use the NetworkUtils
2011-08-25T10:35:17  <simonstewart> Which means I now need to know how the grid node starts a new rc session
2011-08-25T10:35:27  <tyrtyutjg> simonstewart, freynaud, lukeis: the server is: java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.4.0.jar -role hub
2011-08-25T10:35:38  <simonstewart> thanks :)
2011-08-25T10:36:01  <freynaud> simonstewart: the hub recieves a new session, and handles it from RequestHandler.java
2011-08-25T10:36:14  <tyrtyutjg> simonstewart, freynaud, lukeis: the node server is java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.4.0.jar -hub http://localhost:4444 -role webdriver -port 5556
2011-08-25T10:36:23  <freynaud> in the process() method, you have handleNewSession
2011-08-25T10:36:23  <lukeis> tyrtyutjg: they weren't talking to you ;)  only i was
2011-08-25T10:36:45  <freynaud> simonstewart: that's where it forwards the initial request, and handles the redirect, extract location from the header
2011-08-25T10:36:59  <simonstewart> Nice

2011-08-25T10:39:11  <freynaud> simonstewart: do you think the session creation could be the problem ? It's using timestamp and increment.The hub assume session uniquness
2011-08-25T10:39:21  <RossPatterson> Freq18hz: It sounds like you've found a bug in the Python-WebDriver IDE exporter - it should have taken that frame into account.  You should consider opening a bug report.
2011-08-25T10:40:09  <tyrtyutjg> lukeis: any idea?
2011-08-25T10:40:12  <simonstewart> I think session creation is the problem, and I think that the underlying cause is that the rc server isn't picking the right "localhost" address
2011-08-25T10:40:31  <lukeis> tyrtyutjg:  np.. i understand... can you try this code instead of what you had https://gist.github.com/1171287
2011-08-25T10:43:00  <tyrtyutjg> lukeis: it is the same
2011-08-25T10:43:03  <freynaud> simonstewart: the hub uses a host specified using NetworkUtils by default

2011-08-25T10:43:33  <simonstewart> Though that doesn't explain why the problem isn't consistent
2011-08-25T10:43:56  <lukeis> tyrtyutjg: can you try with 2.5.0 (version of selenium) and see if it works
2011-08-25T10:44:13  <santiycr> so, I can't figure out how to get operaDriver to work
2011-08-25T10:44:16  <tyrtyutjg> lukeis: no because I do not have 2.5
2011-08-25T10:44:24  <santiycr> anyone here knows about it well?
2011-08-25T10:44:26  <lukeis> tyrtyutjg: can you download it? :)

2011-08-25T10:46:08  <simonstewart> Exactly
2011-08-25T10:46:12  <tyrtyutjg> sorry lukeis but in my case downloading new selenium is a very long time work
2011-08-25T10:46:16  <tyrtyutjg> seriusly
2011-08-25T10:46:29  <tyrtyutjg> the server is not a big deal but
2011-08-25T10:46:40  <tyrtyutjg> python binding yes
2011-08-25T10:46:49  <lukeis> you don't need to change the python bindings
2011-08-25T10:47:00  <tyrtyutjg> so ok
2011-08-25T10:47:08  <tyrtyutjg> I'll get new server
2011-08-25T10:47:09  <lukeis> whatever you have they are basically the same... just do the server  grid and node
2011-08-25T10:47:30  <freynaud> simonstewart: how is the server host linked to our problem ? if the hub can contact the node, we should be good
2011-08-25T10:47:44  <simonstewart> I just want to understand how the entire system fits together
2011-08-25T10:47:51  <tyrtyutjg> lukeis: it doesn't change the fact that it should work in 2.4
2011-08-25T10:47:55  <tyrtyutjg> :/
2011-08-25T10:47:56  <simonstewart> Specifically, how the selenium instance is told which server to use
2011-08-25T10:48:01  <freynaud> + by default the hub polls the node on /status, so if the host is wrong, it won't be used at all
2011-08-25T10:48:06  <lukeis> tyrtyutjg: true... but ya never know :)
2011-08-25T10:48:12  <tyrtyutjg> lol
2011-08-25T10:48:18  <santiycr> thanks lukeis, those don't work for me
2011-08-25T10:48:28  <freynaud> simonstewart: what node or what url on that node ?
2011-08-25T10:48:39  <tyrtyutjg> lukeis: do you knoiw any alternative testing framework to selenium?
2011-08-25T10:49:01  <simonstewart> When a DefaultSelenium starts, it's told the URL of the server to connect back to (first and second constructor args)
2011-08-25T10:49:06  <lukeis> tyrtyutjg: i know of some... but i only really use selenium for browser testing
2011-08-25T10:49:23  <tyrtyutjg> lukeis: please give me the name

2011-08-25T11:15:30  <freynaud> so the hub has assigned the hub generated key
2011-08-25T11:15:33  <santiycr> ato: no worries, figured it was pretty late up there already
2011-08-25T11:15:36  <simonstewart> Where's that set?

2011-08-25T11:16:05  <simonstewart> So we set the internal key, start the session on the node, get the key from that and set it as the external key
2011-08-25T11:16:25  <jimevans> and with that, I have effectively doubled the size of the .NET bindings downloads.
2011-08-25T11:16:31  <freynaud> yes. debug always says ext key, so the selenium one, except when firefox hasn't started yet
2011-08-25T11:16:38  <freynaud> then you have the message you mentionned
2011-08-25T11:17:15  <SMaction> Ajay: I followed the link you typed.  It takes me to the project page but I still do not see where to dl the add in for firefox (or any file for that matter).  Sorry to be so dense.
2011-08-25T11:17:15  <simonstewart> OK. So it sounds like firefox is taking too long to start up
2011-08-25T11:17:32  <freynaud> RemoteProxy has a 2 timeouts, handled by CleanUpThread
2011-08-25T11:17:36  <Ajay> SMaction: give me a sec
2011-08-25T11:17:45  <freynaud> timeout is for time between 2 commands
2011-08-25T11:17:45  <Ajay> i will get u the link its in xserve
2011-08-25T11:17:57  <freynaud> Orphaned is for browser startup I think.

2011-08-25T11:22:14  <tyrtyutjg> Ajay: server only
2011-08-25T11:22:18  <RossPatterson> Freq18hz: Dunno, but it probably should have, and the export-as-webdriver code is very new.
2011-08-25T11:22:25  <freynaud> simonstewart: the mozilla error is session XX cannot be found on grid
2011-08-25T11:22:46  <freynaud> simonstewart: if it says that, it means a session has already been assigned = the browser started properly

2011-08-25T11:26:14  <lukeis> simonstewart: is everything you're talking about at all related to IE not working on grid? ~ trying to do a simple case with python connecting to a grid to launch ie (everything running on one box), can connect to the node, but not through the grid
2011-08-25T11:26:35  <lukeis> tyrtyutjg: I'm having the same problem you are...
2011-08-25T11:27:02  <jimevans> simonstewart: basically he's added By.attribute and By.composite.

2011-08-25T11:29:35  <freynaud> is it when you debug? if the browser doesn't start and you don't do anything, you'll hit a timeout and a stop will be sent
2011-08-25T11:29:48  <lukeis> check to see if there's not one first though tyrtyutjg
2011-08-25T11:29:49  <jimevans> emil_temp_nick: you've got a couple of options. the easiest is to open the nunit test runner (nunit.exe) and use it to run your tests.
2011-08-25T11:30:05  <Ajay> tyrtyutjg: is chromedriver in u r path ?
2011-08-25T11:31:00  <tyrtyutjg> Ajay: how to say this if server is running with default configuration
2011-08-25T11:31:03  <tyrtyutjg> ?
2011-08-25T11:31:54  <Ajay> i assume u r trying to run something standalone not on grid

2011-08-25T11:33:42  <Ajay> which OS ?

2011-08-25T11:34:05  <tyrtyutjg> Server is on WIndows and program is on UNIX
2011-08-25T11:34:07  <simonstewart> freynaud: so if the new session timeout is set to -1 and the default command time out is set to 3 minutes which gets respected when starting a new session?
2011-08-25T11:34:37  <stephend> and can we add the session ID to the exception? :-)
2011-08-25T11:34:41  <freynaud> simonstewart : both
2011-08-25T11:34:54  <simonstewart> so a three minute timeout?
2011-08-25T11:35:01  <simonstewart> From the client side
2011-08-25T11:35:08  <freynaud> newSessionTimeout is how long you request will wait in the queue before being kicked
2011-08-25T11:35:28  <freynaud> to avoid having test stuck in the queue of the hub for hours
2011-08-25T11:35:47  <Ajay> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/downloads/detail?name=chromedriver_win32_14.0.836.0.zip&can=2&q=
2011-08-25T11:35:52  <freynaud> command timeout is for handling the case where a test doesn't end with a proper quit();
2011-08-25T11:36:03  <simonstewart> OK.
2011-08-25T11:36:29  <simonstewart> So you're saying that if I ask Grid for a new selenium instance it'll wait indefinitely for the session to start?
2011-08-25T11:36:43  <Ajay> place the chromedriver.exe in some directory

2011-08-25T11:42:37  <simonstewart> We're back to the question: if newSessionWaitTimeout is less than the normal command timeout, which appears to be used from a client perspective?
2011-08-25T11:42:49  <tyrtyutjg> oh, lol, now I have a server
2011-08-25T11:42:50  <freynaud> simonstewart: timeout is the max time between 2 commands. If that's met, then a stop session command is issued by the hub
2011-08-25T11:42:55  <stephend> I'm now running a single suite, which was one of the two that was involved in our latest failure
2011-08-25T11:43:07  <Ajay> freynaud is the best person to answer about grid
2011-08-25T11:43:57  <freynaud> simonstewart: if it's less, you will see a grid error somehow
2011-08-25T11:44:01  <simonstewart> So, to be clear: if I do "Selenium se = new DefaultSelenium(); se.start()" how long will it take before "start" barfs?
2011-08-25T11:44:17  <freynaud> simonstewart: instead of returning a valid selenium response starting by OK, jetty will throw a RTE
2011-08-25T11:44:24  <tyrtyutjg> Ajay: my sorry about my lack of patience, but soon will be a last bus
2011-08-25T11:44:26  <tyrtyutjg> to my home

2011-08-25T11:45:16  <simonstewart> OK
2011-08-25T11:45:20  <simonstewart> Why will it do that?
2011-08-25T11:46:16  <Ajay> lukeis: i ont see the changelog updated for 2.5
2011-08-25T11:46:49  <freynaud> simonstewart: RequestHandler.java, line 191
2011-08-25T11:47:12  <simonstewart> Thanks
2011-08-25T11:47:18  <freynaud> if the awaits reach the limit, it just throw a runtime exception
2011-08-25T11:47:28  <freynaud> and for RC protocole, it's not wrapped or anything
2011-08-25T11:47:31  <simonstewart> The newSessionTimeout is set to -1
2011-08-25T11:47:39  <simonstewart> So we shouldn't be hitting that timeout
2011-08-25T11:47:52  <freynaud> it's not elegant, but if you reach that point, it will be very clear it's something wrng with grid, not with FF driver
2011-08-25T11:47:59  <freynaud> no, you shouldn't
2011-08-25T11:48:51  <simonstewart> So we go through RequestHandler:195
2011-08-25T11:49:43  <simonstewart> A proxy is available

2011-08-25T11:50:47  <simonstewart> Also, we should have some handling of interrupted exception
2011-08-25T11:50:59  <simonstewart> Seeing that be thrown is normally a pretty serious condition

2011-08-25T11:52:05  <freynaud> and the signalAll(); is called
2011-08-25T11:52:17  <simonstewart> OK
2011-08-25T11:52:47  <freynaud> at that point, the request has a valid internal session = it has a selenium server assign, and the forwarding can start
2011-08-25T11:52:48  <Freq18hz> lukeis: did you catch those pastebins?
2011-08-25T11:53:00  <BenGrailsGuy> hey I wanted to ask, does anyone have any way of mocking a database before running selenium webdriver tests? my boss doesnt liek the fact that selenium tests depend on the live DB
2011-08-25T11:53:03  <simonstewart> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/attachmentText?id=2037&aid=20370017000&name=selenium-2-5-session-issue.txt&token=b3668125bb80081c629d761b26d9a38e
2011-08-25T11:53:18  <BenGrailsGuy> i told him the whole idea is to ahve functional tests run on the real thing
2011-08-25T11:53:19  <BenGrailsGuy> but...
2011-08-25T11:53:25  <ruel> @BenGrailsGuy
2011-08-25T11:53:34  <ruel> can't you just make a copy of prod?
2011-08-25T11:53:35  <BenGrailsGuy> if theres some way to work with a mocked version of the DB
2011-08-25T11:53:53  <ruel> and run against it?
2011-08-25T11:55:04  <BenGrailsGuy> yeah... :/
2011-08-25T11:55:12  <freynaud> stephend: actually there is a warning alooged already with the session
2011-08-25T11:55:22  <freynaud> log.warning("Cannot find session " + externalKey + " in the registry.");
2011-08-25T11:55:26  <BenGrailsGuy> but then i'll be criticized for adding another manual step we have to do every time the schema of the DB changes
2011-08-25T11:55:42  <freynaud> you should see that warning on the hub just before having the exception on the client side
2011-08-25T11:56:45  <freynaud> stephend: simonstewart : from what I see there are only 2 reason that can happen. Something else has closed the session and it was removed from the hub. A timeout for instance. Or there was a problem and the externalKey was never updated properly
2011-08-25T11:58:04  <simonstewart> We're looking at things now
2011-08-25T11:58:11  <simonstewart> I'm thinking a timeout
2011-08-25T11:58:18  <simonstewart> But we see things fail pretty fast
2011-08-25T11:58:26  <Ajay> BenGrailsGuy: Dbunit
2011-08-25T11:58:39  <simonstewart> How is a session determined as being orphaned?
2011-08-25T11:58:49  <simonstewart> The orphan timeout is something like 5 seconds here
2011-08-25T11:58:56  <stephend> we run typically with py.test -rsX -n 6 (or 8), so we're taking concurrency out of the picture, now

2011-08-25T11:59:54  *** barancev has quit IRC
2011-08-25T12:00:43  <freynaud> orphaned is set at 5 sec
2011-08-25T12:01:01  <freynaud> this is very optimistic
2011-08-25T12:01:21  <simonstewart> Quite possibly
2011-08-25T12:01:44  <simonstewart> Wondering whether an orphan sweep is done as the session starts
2011-08-25T12:01:58  <freynaud> orhaned 5 sec doesn't really mean 5 sec to start
2011-08-25T12:02:03  <simonstewart> Orpahn timeout is "clean up cycle" right?
2011-08-25T12:02:14  <freynaud> the cleanup thread runs every cleanup cycle
2011-08-25T12:02:34  <simonstewart> And I assume that finding orphans is part of cleanup?
2011-08-25T12:02:42  <freynaud> yes
2011-08-25T12:02:51  <freynaud> every cleanup cycle, the clean up runs
2011-08-25T12:03:03  <freynaud> and check each session for orphaned nad timeout
2011-08-25T12:03:12  <simonstewart> So if the browser is "mid startup" and an orphan sweep is done could that cause a problem?
2011-08-25T12:03:24  <simonstewart> Would that cause the session to be removed from the queue
2011-08-25T12:03:26  <simonstewart> ?
2011-08-25T12:03:26  <freynaud> definitly
2011-08-25T12:03:46  <freynaud> but from the lofs davehunt send me some time ago
2011-08-25T12:04:04  <freynaud> there was no working of orphaned regarting its sessions
2011-08-25T12:04:11  <freynaud> lofs = logs
2011-08-25T12:04:30  <simonstewart> Hmmm...
2011-08-25T12:05:26  <stephend> freynaud: just to test, how can we raise the threshold of cleanUpCycle?
2011-08-25T12:05:52  <freynaud> -cleanUpCycle command line
2011-08-25T12:06:18  <stephend> k, thx
2011-08-25T12:06:24  <simonstewart> What else can remove a session from the hub?
2011-08-25T12:06:24  <freynaud> or change it in DeafaultHub.json
2011-08-25T12:06:37  <simonstewart> What happens when "stop" is called twice?
2011-08-25T12:06:42  <freynaud> only orphaned, timeout and stop
2011-08-25T12:07:29  <freynaud> simonstewart: if stop is recieved, it's handled in RequestHandler.java
2011-08-25T12:07:36  <simonstewart> ok
2011-08-25T12:07:42  <simonstewart> I wonder.....
2011-08-25T12:07:43  <stephend> if we're using Ant to launch this, I'll have to change build.xml, right?
2011-08-25T12:07:46  <freynaud> and if you have it twice, you'll be on line 145
2011-08-25T12:08:14  <freynaud> stephend: yes. http://hub:444/grid/console
2011-08-25T12:08:20  <freynaud> you'll have a debug link
2011-08-25T12:08:27  <freynaud> that will dump you all the settings
2011-08-25T12:08:42  <freynaud> make sure you have the cleanup cycle you want
2011-08-25T12:09:54  <freynaud> simonstewart: what do you wonder ?
2011-08-25T12:10:08  <simonstewart> I'm wondering if one of the tests is cleaning up nicely
2011-08-25T12:10:23  <freynaud> simonstewart: also, FYI, stop() sent by the client is not process sync.
2011-08-25T12:10:30  <simonstewart> So someone is doing a "stop" in the test
2011-08-25T12:10:38  <simonstewart> and then teardown is _also_ called "stop"
2011-08-25T12:10:57  <freynaud> then you have session not available
2011-08-25T12:11:03  <freynaud> but you'll have that too without grid
2011-08-25T12:11:07  <simonstewart> Right.
2011-08-25T12:11:24  <freynaud> and that wouldn't be hard to reproduce
2011-08-25T12:11:44  <simonstewart> You'd imagine
2011-08-25T12:12:01  <freynaud> davehunt: has done a lot of tests
2011-08-25T12:12:14  <freynaud> and with 3 nodes on his local machine, he cannot see the problem
2011-08-25T12:12:31  <freynaud> I'm assuming he is running the same tests that the ones creating the issue in a more fancy envt

2011-08-25T13:01:12  <jimevans> XRayCulver: what are you wanting to know?
2011-08-25T13:01:29  <XRayCulver> if there is an issue with alert boxes in chrome
2011-08-25T13:02:02  <XRayCulver> works in ie
2011-08-25T13:02:23  <jimevans> in what sense? it should work if you're on chrome dev channel.
2011-08-25T13:02:43  <jimevans> the browser changes needed to let the chromedriver respond to alerts isn't available in the stable channel yet.
2011-08-25T13:02:54  <jimevans> (dunno about beta channel)
2011-08-25T13:02:56  <XRayCulver> channel = release?
2011-08-25T13:02:58  *** sdimkov has joined #selenium
2011-08-25T13:03:18  *** cgoldberg has quit IRC
2011-08-25T13:03:20  <XRayCulver> i'm using their release for win32 on the downloads page
2011-08-25T13:03:23  <jimevans> sort of. http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel
2011-08-25T13:03:51  <XRayCulver> i see
2011-08-25T13:03:57  <XRayCulver> are you using the dev channel?
2011-08-25T13:04:04  <jimevans> making alerts work in chrome requires an updated browser, not just an updated driver exe.
2011-08-25T13:04:10  <jimevans> and yes, i'm using the dev channel
2011-08-25T13:04:30  *** cgoldberg has joined #selenium
2011-08-25T13:04:33  <XRayCulver> updated browser, like a beta release for that?
2011-08-25T13:04:39  <XRayCulver> or the most current public release?
2011-08-25T13:04:50  <jimevans> updated browser, like a beta release.
2011-08-25T13:04:58  <XRayCulver> ah
2011-08-25T13:04:59  <jimevans> check out the link i just sent
2011-08-25T13:05:13  <jimevans> it describes what the "channels" are for chrome.
2011-08-25T13:05:24  <jimevans> "stable" is the latest "public" release.
2011-08-25T13:05:57  <jimevans> "beta" is what you'd probably call beta, "dev" revs more often, but can be less stable.
2011-08-25T13:06:03  <XRayCulver> right
2011-08-25T13:06:15  <jimevans> (though to be sure, i've not encountered any troubles running with the dev channel)
2011-08-25T13:06:21  <XRayCulver> ic
2011-08-25T13:06:29  <XRayCulver> so the driver just uses whatever relase of chrome i'm running
2011-08-25T13:06:33  <jimevans> yes.
2011-08-25T13:06:35  <XRayCulver> the driver isn't specific to a release version
2011-08-25T13:06:59  <jimevans> not really.
2011-08-25T13:07:17  <XRayCulver> good to know
2011-08-25T13:07:38  <jimevans> there may be specific things in the chromedriver.exe that are version specific, but they should degrade on earlier versions
2011-08-25T13:07:39  <XRayCulver> how long till release gets the alerts handling?
2011-08-25T13:07:44  <jimevans> (if i understand correctly)
2011-08-25T13:07:54  <jimevans> i have no idea.
2011-08-25T13:08:01  <XRayCulver> kk
2011-08-25T13:08:20  <jimevans> i'm not keyed into the chrome release schedule, but 12 weeks maybe?
2011-08-25T13:08:22  <jimevans> less?
2011-08-25T13:08:25  <jimevans> i dunno
2011-08-25T13:08:41  <XRayCulver> well how long have alerts been workign on the dev channel?
2011-08-25T13:09:08  <jimevans> i don't know that either. :) I uninstalled "stable" and installed "dev" to get them working.
2011-08-25T13:09:13  <XRayCulver> haha
2011-08-25T13:09:20  <jimevans> just did it this week, in fact.
2011-08-25T13:09:21  <XRayCulver> any issues with dev?
2011-08-25T13:09:25  <jimevans> not yet.
2011-08-25T13:09:29  <XRayCulver> kk
2011-08-25T13:09:40  <XRayCulver> thanks for the info
2011-08-25T13:09:50  <XRayCulver> i'll check it out when i get some time
2011-08-25T13:11:07  <jimevans> np
2011-08-25T13:12:38  <XRayCulver> jimevans: one other question, when using a dropdown that dynamicaly loads a section, the SelectElement.SelectByText() loads it in chrome
2011-08-25T13:12:51  <XRayCulver> in IE it changes the dropdown but doens't fire the change
2011-08-25T13:12:58  <jimevans> is it jquery?
2011-08-25T13:13:04  <XRayCulver> i think so
2011-08-25T13:13:06  <XRayCulver> let me look
2011-08-25T13:13:23  * jimevans hates jquery for exactly this reason.
2011-08-25T13:13:52  <XRayCulver> yah
2011-08-25T13:14:04  <jimevans> one sec.
2011-08-25T13:14:04  <XRayCulver> whats best workaround? sendkeys.tab?
2011-08-25T13:14:09  <XRayCulver> kk
2011-08-25T13:14:42  <jimevans> there. had to tweet.
2011-08-25T13:14:49  <XRayCulver> heh
2011-08-25T13:14:56  <XRayCulver> i really need to get into twitter more
2011-08-25T13:15:28  <jimevans> what's happening is that under the covers, we're calling the onchange event of the dropdown.
2011-08-25T13:15:39  <jimevans> jquery's change event doesn't trigger on the html event.
2011-08-25T13:15:50  <jimevans> (this is all in IE only, mind you)
2011-08-25T13:16:20  <XRayCulver> ok
2011-08-25T13:16:24  <jimevans> if you focus another element, does it trigger the event?
2011-08-25T13:16:35  <jimevans> after the select that is.
2011-08-25T13:16:35  <XRayCulver> thats what i'm going to try
2011-08-25T13:16:43  <XRayCulver> whats the best way to focus? click()?
2011-08-25T13:16:46  <jimevans> i'm betting no, but it's woth a shot.

2011-08-25T13:16:53  <XRayCulver> keys.tab?
2011-08-25T13:17:10  *** DustinFay has joined #selenium
2011-08-25T13:17:14  <jimevans> though tabbing might not be a bad idea either.

2011-08-25T13:18:43  <XRayCulver> trying click now
2011-08-25T13:19:55  <XRayCulver> didnt work
2011-08-25T13:19:56  <XRayCulver> but
2011-08-25T13:20:07  <XRayCulver> i had it workign w/o selectElement before
2011-08-25T13:20:10  <XRayCulver> checking what it was
2011-08-25T13:21:03  <jimevans> you can force it with javascript, i think, but you'd need to hit the jquery docs for that. .trigger() is the method i think

2011-08-25T13:27:04  <XRayCulver> err 2nd group of lines
2011-08-25T13:27:11  <jimevans> yeah. got it.
2011-08-25T13:28:24  <XRayCulver> the click() fires the js for me
2011-08-25T13:28:53  <jimevans> ok, i think i see what has to happen.
2011-08-25T13:29:16  <jimevans> we really really need a set of jquery tests in the webdriver test bed.
2011-08-25T13:31:07  <jimevans> no, wait. i'm wrong. the click automation atom *should* be handling the setting of the Selected property.
2011-08-25T13:31:20  *** Parabola has joined #selenium
2011-08-25T13:31:54  <XRayCulver> its not using that atom in SelectElement();?
2011-08-25T13:32:07  <jimevans> no, it is. that's what i mean.
