2011-06-16T06:07:58  <RossPatterson> I considered it, but I'm not conviced that PageFactory is a good idea.  I kind of like the idea of hand-crafted page objects.  Of course, I'm not a fan of *any* kind of code generator, so maybe I'm just a dinosaur.
2011-06-16T06:08:18  <davehunt> Okay, the next London Selenium Users Meetup event will be on Tuesday 16th August at eBay :)

2011-06-16T09:05:53  <jarib> QAguy: you're probably using the old build where you had to symlink to Chromium.app, and the symlink is broken when chrome auto-updates

2011-06-16T09:06:37  <jarib> lawcab: actually i was testing with ruby (the equivalent of RC2), but that shouldn't really matter
2011-06-16T09:07:14  <jarib> it's all the same code being executed to actually perform the click
2011-06-16T09:07:34  <nirvdrum> jarib: We probably should change the version of the selenium-webdriver gem to be more in-line with Selenium itself.
2011-06-16T09:07:37  <nirvdrum> Maybe post 2.0 release.
2011-06-16T09:07:53  <jarib> nirvdrum: indeed, that's the plan post 2.0

2011-06-16T09:09:21  <QAguy> That might be the problem
2011-06-16T09:09:52  <jarib> if it works for a while, the problem is that you're using an old chromedriver build (where you needed the symlink to Chromium.app)
2011-06-16T09:10:03  <jarib> and that is broken by auto-updates
2011-06-16T09:11:13  <QAguy> Ah that explains it

2011-06-16T09:24:14  <nirvdrum> Oddly, Microsoft seems to get that right.  I've got a custom plugin that works IE6 - IE9.  The only modification needed was related to parent CWNDs changing with the introduction of tabbed browsing.

2011-06-16T10:56:06  <jrock20041> mh512: When the browser is brought up it does not use cache

2011-06-16T10:57:06  <RossPatterson> jrock20041: Depending on the browser and Selenium version, it does indeed use caching.
2011-06-16T10:57:42  <jrock20041> RossPatterson: really I thought it only caches during run
2011-06-16T10:57:54  <jrock20041> when run ends and the browser closes all that is lost
2011-06-16T10:58:38  <RossPatterson> Nope.  Selenium 1, for example, doesn't suppress caching at all.  But it does ensure that the browser starts with an empty cache.
2011-06-16T11:00:11  <jrock20041> I will have to test this cause last time I tried it did not work
2011-06-16T11:00:29  <jrock20041> We had to set a parameter to enable caching, then it would save it
2011-06-16T11:00:39  <RossPatterson> Which browser?
2011-06-16T11:00:49  <jrock20041> firefox, ie, and now chrome
2011-06-16T11:00:56  <RossPatterson> Se 1 or 2?
2011-06-16T11:00:59  <jrock20041> 2
2011-06-16T11:01:04  <RossPatterson> Ah, that's different.
2011-06-16T11:01:08  <jrock20041> ok
2011-06-16T11:01:20  <jrock20041> so version 1 did cache things buts not 2
2011-06-16T11:01:20  <jrock20041> ?
2011-06-16T11:01:30  <adamgoucher> (and a better question would have been 'rc or webdriver')
2011-06-16T11:01:47  <RossPatterson> (correct)
2011-06-16T11:02:09  <RossPatterson> RC starts browsers with empty caches.  I don't know how WebDriver does it.
2011-06-16T11:02:21  <jrock20041> same
2011-06-16T11:02:28  <jrock20041> we use webdriver
2011-06-16T11:03:00  <RossPatterson> Well, yes, the result would be the same, because using stale caches would make tests unreliable.  But I meant I don't know what technique WebDriver uses to ensure the emptiness.
2011-06-16T11:03:27  <RossPatterson> mh512: You got your answer?

2011-06-16T11:04:35  <AutomatedTester> dont know if it still does
2011-06-16T11:08:27  <antlong> you can disable disk caching through the browser prefs, in between runs afaik it prevents cache reuse by using a unique string to store the cache files in /tmp/ or such
2011-06-16T11:08:34  <mh512> RossPatterson: yeah thanks!
2011-06-16T11:08:58  <mh512> currently i am using selenium 1 and i disable caching in firefox pref just to play safe
2011-06-16T11:09:12  <antlong> theres a clear cache command in se1

2011-06-16T11:11:25  <jrock20041> driver.manage.deleteAllCookies() is something you could do mh512

2011-06-16T14:01:04  *** jleyba has joined #selenium
2011-06-16T14:01:21  <barancev> jleyba: hi!
2011-06-16T14:01:46  <jleyba> barancev: hi
2011-06-16T14:01:47  <barancev> jleyba: can you look at #1874
2011-06-16T14:01:48  <selbot2>  closed/invalid r12482 commit missed a file ExpectedConditions.java - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1874
2011-06-16T14:02:43  <jleyba> Yes. I intentionally didn't commit the file, but forgot to update build.desc
2011-06-16T14:02:53  <barancev> why?
2011-06-16T14:03:30  <barancev> have you refactored it?
2011-06-16T14:03:47  <jleyba> It's just a collection of static factory methods.  I wanted to get the API right before committing since 2.0 may be cut soon
2011-06-16T14:04:24  <barancev> yes, this collection was quite usable
2011-06-16T14:04:46  <barancev> static factory methods in lift style are not rare
2011-06-16T14:05:22  <barancev> it's support, not core API
2011-06-16T14:05:23  <jleyba> I'm not porting the ones in the test tree
2011-06-16T14:06:15  <jleyba> I mean, the functionality will be there, but it's not a straight "move from java/test to java/src"
2011-06-16T14:06:54  <jleyba> The finally API will probably look something like:
2011-06-16T14:07:26  <jleyba> waitingOn(driver).withTimeout(3, SECONDS).pollingEvery(250, MILLISECONDS).until(elementFound(By.id("foo")));
2011-06-16T14:08:36  <barancev> with elementFound a static factory method?
2011-06-16T14:09:48  <jleyba> yes
2011-06-16T14:10:35  <barancev> looks good, well, I'm patiently waiting for the end of this transition :)

2011-06-16T14:30:41  <doc_tuna> hey
2011-06-16T14:30:50  <doc_tuna> I noticed in the python client, the stable release
2011-06-16T14:31:40  <doc_tuna> everything seems to indicate that desired_capabilities={'brwoser_name':'firefox'} is the correct syntax
2011-06-16T14:31:50  <doc_tuna> for specifying browsername with remote webdriver
2011-06-16T14:32:01  <doc_tuna> but.. it's actually browserName not browser_name
2011-06-16T14:32:26  <doc_tuna> I found that out by digging in the code
2011-06-16T14:33:55  <doc_tuna> Should I maybe be working with the development version
2011-06-16T14:34:08  <doc_tuna> instead of the last stable release of the python bindings?
2011-06-16T14:35:04  <doc_tuna> i was told the python bindings were officially supported but this makes me think they are not too well tested
2011-06-16T14:35:45  <antlong> no
2011-06-16T14:37:32  <antlong> driver.Remote(webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX)
2011-06-16T14:38:13  <doc_tuna> another thing is it apparently wants to write to the address bar instead of a page element
2011-06-16T14:38:36  <doc_tuna> which i didn't seem to have with a remotewebdriver in java
