2011-07-20T01:34:49  <easonhan> hi everybody, i think i know how to get a profile, but i can not find any methods that related with cookies in the Profile class. Is there any samples about using profile to get the existed cookies?
2011-07-20T01:35:06  <jarib> angshu: hmm
2011-07-20T01:35:44  <jarib> angshu: was this you? https://gist.github.com/1092497 that seems to work
2011-07-20T01:36:43  <jarib> angshu: could it be on the real page that the 'value' property is being modified after onload, and you expect to see the modified value?
2011-07-20T01:37:03  <jarib> or do you have the problem with just a static page as well?
2011-07-20T01:38:19  <angshu> jarib: yes. same test. no when the page is loaded it has some default values, no onload modification.
2011-07-20T01:38:52  <angshu> jarib: also even with the test html snip that I send over, it fails for me.
2011-07-20T01:39:21  <angshu> jarib: exactly, even with the static page.
2011-07-20T01:39:49  <jarib> then i don't see why we see different behaviour
2011-07-20T01:40:36  <angshu> yes, vague! it also behaves oddly on IE8, and FF3.6.
2011-07-20T01:46:27  <jarib> working consistently on Firefox 5 (mac + win), Chrome (mac + win) and IE9 for me
2011-07-20T01:47:37  <angshu> for me, on FF 3.6 getText() works, FF5.0.1 - first getText() and then getAttribute() works, on IE8 - same

2011-07-20T04:06:33  <pngl> Is there a simple way to "switch to newly opened popup"? It seems that WD only provides window handles that look like this: 2a97e2e4-05ea-4b83-9f7c-97e7fa9d8acc, which means I'd have to compare window_handles before and after opening a window, then switch to the new element.
2011-07-20T04:06:50  <simonstewart> that's the way to do it
2011-07-20T04:07:10  <pngl> alright
2011-07-20T04:07:37  <jarib> pngl: you're using ruby, right? did i mention watir-webdriver to you?
2011-07-20T04:07:58  <jarib> it lets you do e.g. browser.window(:title => "foo").use { ... }
2011-07-20T04:07:59  <simonstewart> It took a 2 days, but I found the problematic call and have fixed it
2011-07-20T04:08:15  <simonstewart> Not well, but well enough. Now for a proper fix
2011-07-20T04:08:22  <jarib> what problematic call?
2011-07-20T04:08:33  <simonstewart> There's been a bunch of tests failing in google
2011-07-20T04:08:44  <simonstewart> and it's been wildly painful to track down why
2011-07-20T04:08:52  <jarib> aha
2011-07-20T04:09:54  <simonstewart> Turns out calling "onmouseover" with no args is a daft thing to do

2011-07-20T04:11:13  <pngl> jarib: ahh, didn't see that one
2011-07-20T04:11:50  <pngl> jarib: looping through the windows is nice btw, my method was going to be much less robust.
2011-07-20T04:11:58  <jarib> simonstewart: the one i added a try/catch for?
2011-07-20T04:12:22  <simonstewart> yeah
2011-07-20T04:12:26  <simonstewart> *sigh*
2011-07-20T04:12:40  <simonstewart> I'm putting together a neater fix
2011-07-20T04:13:09  <jarib> if the event handler throws, we should still catch it and push on
2011-07-20T04:13:16  <jarib> i added a test for that
2011-07-20T04:13:37  <simonstewart> It does
2011-07-20T04:13:51  <simonstewart> But GWT apps fail because they expect the event to be there
2011-07-20T04:13:59  <simonstewart> So although webdriver is fine, the app isn't
2011-07-20T04:14:04  <jarib> aye

2011-07-20T04:15:53  <jarib> what i don't get in that code is why we use bot.events.fire for mouseout/mousemove but not mouseover

2011-07-20T09:09:42  <jarib> dawagner: the case is typing into a password field, which appears to be filled on focus. so the value ends up being "passwordpassword" instead of "password"
2011-07-20T09:10:15  <dawagner> That sounds like autofill... Strange :S Happening when you do it manually?

2011-07-20T11:31:46  <ygerasimov> I am working on integration of selenium 2 to testing framework of Drupal
2011-07-20T11:31:59  <ygerasimov> got one problem
2011-07-20T11:32:18  <lord1234> tell us the problem
2011-07-20T11:32:23  <ygerasimov> in drupal 7 there is heavy use of vertical tabs javascript in forms that hides some of the fields
2011-07-20T11:32:40  <ygerasimov> I am trying to submit form with values that includes values for hidden elements
2011-07-20T11:33:11  <ygerasimov> and of course when I try to sendKeys to hidden textbox for example I got exception that this element is hidden
2011-07-20T11:33:22  *** angshu has joined #selenium
2011-07-20T11:33:33  <ygerasimov> is there any way to avoid such collision?
2011-07-20T11:34:35  <lord1234> unhide the element?
2011-07-20T11:34:42  *** nirvdrum has quit IRC
2011-07-20T11:34:42  <lord1234> the element needs to have focus for selenium to hit it.....

2011-07-20T11:36:13  <ygerasimov> I know exactly what javascripts hide my elements, if I could disable them all elements would be accessible
2011-07-20T11:36:35  <lord1234> thats a question for your development..not selenium...
2011-07-20T11:36:46  <lord1234> or you can find a way to force your page from loading those JS files
2011-07-20T11:37:24  <lord1234> again, not a selenium question
2011-07-20T11:37:51  <ygerasimov> alright
2011-07-20T11:38:06  <ygerasimov> thank you for help. I will think about workaround

2011-07-20T11:52:02  <ygerasimov> jarib, I understand the question. Of course I would need to unhide form elements first
2011-07-20T11:52:25  <Parabola> awesome
2011-07-20T11:52:26  <ygerasimov> I am thinking about injecting javascript to unhide all elements first
2011-07-20T11:52:32  <Parabola> i just found a java wrapper library for Basecamp
2011-07-20T11:52:38  <lord1234> ygerasimov: the point is
2011-07-20T11:52:39  <jarib> ygerasimov: what action would a user take, and why can't your test do the same?
2011-07-20T11:52:47  <lord1234> if you can't figure out how to test it manually, there is no way to do it automatically
2011-07-20T11:53:46  <ygerasimov> lord1234, jarib, my idea is a bit different. There is already unit testing framework implemented on drupal. I would like to make selenium framework as close as possible so other developers won't need to learn much new API's
2011-07-20T11:54:23  <ygerasimov> this will help a lot to introduce this framework to the community and let people start writing tests and contributing
2011-07-20T11:55:09  <ygerasimov> but I completely understand that it has nothing to do with selenium, so I will find how to avoid the case with hidden elements
2011-07-20T11:55:31  <jarib> well, you can set the value through execute_script
2011-07-20T11:55:50  <jarib> but in most cases you should try to emulate user actions as close as possible
2011-07-20T11:56:22  <jarib> what language are you writing tests in?
2011-07-20T11:58:45  <ygerasimov> php
2011-07-20T11:59:04  <jarib> ok, not familiar with the php bindings
2011-07-20T11:59:39  <jarib> but in ruby you could e.g. do driver.execute_script("arguments[0].value = arguments[1]", element, value)
2011-07-20T12:00:02  <jarib> but again, sticking to what a user can do is strongly recommended
2011-07-20T12:00:20  <ygerasimov> yes, I understand that. Thanks for help
2011-07-20T12:00:20  <jarib> i'm sure those hidden fields are filled in response to some user action :)
2011-07-20T12:01:00  <Parabola> I need some conceptual help :)
2011-07-20T12:01:08  <ygerasimov> they just got unhidden when user clicks on appropriative block
2011-07-20T12:01:32  <lord1234> parabola whats that?
2011-07-20T12:01:47  <Parabola> i've written a test (java) and i have a single try/catch, to ensure login is right, if its not it does somthing else
2011-07-20T12:02:07  <Parabola> my question is whats a good way to implement multiple checks?
2011-07-20T12:02:20  <Parabola> i was looking at nested try/catch but i couldnt get that working right

2011-07-20T12:43:43  <Parabola> using what you provided me, i'm putting an if/else in there. i dont have access to .click() though
2011-07-20T12:43:47  <Parabola> and i'm not sure why
2011-07-20T12:44:18  <Parabola> "the method click is undefined for type webdriver"
2011-07-20T12:45:02  <Parabola> it offers to add a cast for me, but that didnt work
2011-07-20T12:45:33  *** angshu has quit IRC
2011-07-20T12:46:47  <jarib> the method isElementPresent doesn't return the element, it just returns true or false
2011-07-20T12:47:10  <jarib> so you'll have to call findElement again or do something else
2011-07-20T12:47:17  <Parabola> hmm

2011-07-20T15:06:21  <ygerasimov> thanks AutomatedTester
2011-07-20T15:06:28  <AutomatedTester> then selenium-server-standalone can start it and handle the port stuff for you
2011-07-20T15:06:59  <nirvdrum> davehunt: The idea behind the orphaned session detection is you create a session but no other commands are issued.  After 5 or 10 seconds (I don't recall which), the session will be considered orphaned and reaped.
2011-07-20T15:07:38  <davehunt> nirvdrum: if a session is reaped it appears not to be feeding this back to the testrunner
2011-07-20T15:07:41  <nirvdrum> davehunt: The case I'm trying to handle is a client is in the newSessionsRequest queue, disconnects somehow, the hub gets a free test slot, pulls that request from the queue, and then forwards it to the node.
2011-07-20T15:08:18  <nirvdrum> At that point, that slot on the node is effectively locked up because there's no client to communicate with it.
2011-07-20T15:08:24  <nirvdrum> I.e., it's been orphaned.
2011-07-20T15:08:29  <davehunt> the testrunner is timing out eventually
2011-07-20T15:08:54  <nirvdrum> The test runner should be running on the clientside, so I'm not sure how that'd be impacted.
2011-07-20T15:09:06  <davehunt> this is just weird though, these sessions aren't orphaned
2011-07-20T15:09:07  <nirvdrum> Either the client disconnected or timed out, in which case the runner should raise an exception.
2011-07-20T15:09:22  <nirvdrum> Or the hub screwed up, in which case the client would try to communicate with a closed session.
2011-07-20T15:09:31  *** tomh- has joined #selenium
2011-07-20T15:09:49  <nirvdrum> And it'd still get an exception.
2011-07-20T15:10:11  <davehunt> It looks like it's never getting a response from start_session
2011-07-20T15:10:21  <davehunt> although the browser has launched
2011-07-20T15:10:36  *** ssims has quit IRC
2011-07-20T15:10:38  <nirvdrum> Hmm . . . that'd suggest a communication issue between the hub and the client then.
2011-07-20T15:10:58  <nirvdrum> Someone reported an issue with lingering sockets and the hub.
2011-07-20T15:11:09  <nirvdrum> If you restart your hub, do you still see the problem?
2011-07-20T15:11:45  <nirvdrum> And thanks again for being patient here.  You've run into a lot of crappy issues.  Alas, it's a kinda complicated component that suffers from also being new.
2011-07-20T15:12:58  <davehunt> I see this problem nomatter how many times I restart :)
2011-07-20T15:13:19  <davehunt> This was working earlier... and is working on our remote servers
2011-07-20T15:13:28  <nirvdrum> Hmm . . .
2011-07-20T15:13:57  <nirvdrum> I'd be interested in a jstack output if you could.  It'd be nice if there were some way to monitor the traffic, too.  tcpdump or wireshark.
2011-07-20T15:14:45  <davehunt> tbh, this was one last thing before I headed to bed

2011-07-20T15:54:22  <Siph0n> Is there any reason sendKeys and click would push my screen up so the field is at the very top? And everything above it can't be viewed.
2011-07-20T15:55:09  <Siph0n> SelectByVisibleText doesn't do that.

2011-07-20T16:02:26  <jarib> it scrolls the element into view
2011-07-20T16:02:54  <jarib> i guess it could scroll it to the middle of the screen, but why does it matter to you?
2011-07-20T16:05:59  <Siph0n> Maybe its the web page im using, but everything above the current element is not visible anymore. I am scrolled up on the page, but the top field is the last field I sent sendkeys or click to.
2011-07-20T16:06:51  <Siph0n> If I don't use Selenium, the page views fine.

2011-07-20T16:50:53  <gordolio> looking to implement a perl webdriver test framework.
2011-07-20T16:56:10  <jarib> gordolio: check out https://github.com/aivaturi/Selenium-Remote-Driver if you haven't seen it
2011-07-20T16:56:18  <gordolio> I have seen it.
2011-07-20T16:56:20  *** nirvdrum has joined #selenium
2011-07-20T16:56:28  <gordolio> I didn't like it that much.
2011-07-20T16:56:33  <gordolio> it's a little cumbersome to use.
2011-07-20T16:57:30  <gordolio> I have thought about maybe fixing those things that I didn't like about it.
2011-07-20T16:58:05  <jarib> what didn't you like about it?
2011-07-20T16:58:46  <gordolio> my $ret = $driver->find_element('fooelem','linktext');
2011-07-20T16:59:15  <gordolio> if($ret->{cmd_status} ne '0') {die 'horrible death';}
2011-07-20T16:59:26  <jarib> ouch
2011-07-20T16:59:30  <gordolio> my $elem = $ret->{cmd_return};
2011-07-20T16:59:41  <jarib> yeah, i see what you mean :)
2011-07-20T16:59:47  <gordolio> yeah, heh.

2011-07-20T17:02:09  <gordolio> I may just fix that part... and stay with that framework...
2011-07-20T17:02:34  <gordolio> but then there's the question of generating TAP output... and how that should work.
2011-07-20T17:03:41  <gordolio> Currently Test::WWW::Selenium has an _ok method for every selenese command...
2011-07-20T17:04:09  <gordolio> you could do...
2011-07-20T17:04:24  <jarib> i don't know much about perl/TAP, but shouldn't that be the responsibility of some sort of test runner?
2011-07-20T17:04:35  <jarib> i.e. not webdriver-specific per se
2011-07-20T17:05:33  <gordolio> that's what I'm trying to figure out I guess...
2011-07-20T17:05:36  <gordolio> but you're right.
2011-07-20T17:05:53  <gordolio> a properly written test will drive the interface...
2011-07-20T17:06:04  <gordolio> and then come up with some sort of pass/fail
2011-07-20T17:08:14  <gordolio> that's probably the thing to do.
2011-07-20T17:08:37  <gordolio> leave the testing out of even the generated perl code (from the ide).

2011-07-20T17:18:42  <toddnine> Hi guys.  Using seleniumIDE and "waitForTextPresent"  Is there way to do an ||, where the text is either A || B?
2011-07-20T17:28:38  <gordolio> toddnine: in what language?
2011-07-20T17:29:17  <gordolio> you can do waitForCondition('selenium.isTextPresent("foo1") || selenium.isTextPresent("foo2")')

2011-07-20T18:24:23  <gordolio> then you should be able to do selenium.waitForCondition(selenium.isTextPresent("foo1") || selenium.isTextPresent("foo2"));

2011-07-20T23:29:44  *** sdqali has quit IRC
2011-07-20T23:30:14  <srijayanth> We're trying to invoke a quit on an instance of FirefoxDriver. This instance is also running through a proxy. When quit is invoked, it dies with an exception
2011-07-20T23:30:39  <srijayanth> org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: org.apache.http.conn.HttpHostConnectException: Connection to http://127.0.0.1:7055 refused
2011-07-20T23:31:47  <srijayanth> Tracing  through the code, it would seem like firefox's lazy command executor is still delegating a quit call further down
2011-07-20T23:31:57  <srijayanth> Finally when the http client gets this, it just poops
2011-07-20T23:32:37  <srijayanth> Is this expected? If so, is there anything one has to do while dealing with proxies before calling quit
2011-07-20T23:33:33  <srijayanth> Any ideas anyone?

2011-07-20T23:34:52  <srijayanth> More to the point...it seems like RemoteWebDriver is actually delegating a quit call to execute instead of delegating it to FirefoxDriver.quit
