2011-08-29T08:20:07  <sdf> I want to do click("link=Defined Link/link=Sublink")
2011-08-29T08:20:22  <sdf> why it does not work?
2011-08-29T08:21:20  <RossPatterson> What do you expect that do do?
2011-08-29T08:21:34  <RossPatterson> And which API are you using?
2011-08-29T08:21:49  <sdf> Click on "Defined link" name
2011-08-29T08:22:01  <sdf> and click on Sublink
2011-08-29T08:22:15  <sdf> sorry... Click on Sublink just
2011-08-29T08:22:40  <sdf> which is subelement of "Defined link"
2011-08-29T08:22:48  <sdf> :>
2011-08-29T08:23:01  <sdf> I'm not sure if you know what I mean
2011-08-29T08:23:14  <sdf> :) I see I'm not clear
2011-08-29T08:23:39  <RossPatterson> Sounds like you want Selenium to do something it doesn't do.  There is no such thing as a "sublink" in HTML.
2011-08-29T08:24:09  <sdf> I know
2011-08-29T08:24:10  <Fry33_>  click("link=Defined Link/link=Sublink") - you should use xpath there
2011-08-29T08:24:37  <sdf> Fry33_: : how?
2011-08-29T08:24:39  <sdf> :>
2011-08-29T08:24:54  <sdf> I have a title and under the title is a link
2011-08-29T08:25:17  <RossPatterson> Sounds like you need to share the HTML.  Use this -> :gist
2011-08-29T08:25:17  <selbot2> Please paste >3 lines of text to http://gist.github.com
2011-08-29T08:25:19  <Fry33_> something like this  click("//a/a")
2011-08-29T08:25:25  <sdf> honestly I've got two links that has the same name
2011-08-29T08:25:28  <sdf> :D
2011-08-29T08:26:21  <sdf> I want to click the second one

2011-08-29T08:27:43  <Fry33_> http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/xpath_examples.asp
2011-08-29T08:29:52  <sdf> Fry33_: what if I want to have relative path?
2011-08-29T08:30:35  <Fry33_> xpath can do this;)
2011-08-29T08:31:29  <sdf> Fry33_: but I'm not sure if I'll be able to invoke: xmlDoc.selectNodes(xpath);
2011-08-29T08:31:31  <RossPatterson> XPath can do almost anything, if you just know how to ask it to do so.  Share your HTML and one of us can probably give you an example.
2011-08-29T08:32:20  <Fry33_> Selenium support xpath locators natively
2011-08-29T08:32:48  <sdf> RossPatterson: this html is generated automaticaly, you do not want to see it, belive me ;)
2011-08-29T08:33:07  <sdf> so I want to do the text-based search
2011-08-29T08:33:08  <sdf> like

2011-08-29T08:34:34  <sdf> <div> <a>link with text</a><a> link with text</a></div>
2011-08-29T08:34:46  <sdf> and I want to click the second one
2011-08-29T08:34:56  <Fry33_> /div/a[2]
2011-08-29T08:35:10  * RossPatterson has to type faster.
2011-08-29T08:35:14  <sdf> yes but I do not have /div root
2011-08-29T08:35:24  <RossPatterson> //div/a[2] then.
2011-08-29T08:35:52  <sdf> but how to say a[2] is link with text

2011-08-29T09:51:27  <lukeis> BenGrailsGuy: with webdriverwait that time is how long it takes to timeout, do you want it to timeout in < 1 second? (under the hood it only executes the "until" every 0.5 seconds... so with 1 second you really only get 2 tries)
2011-08-29T09:52:06  <BenGrailsGuy> that's bad. looks like i'm going to have to use thread.sleep   :(
2011-08-29T09:52:58  <kennethkoontz> BenGrailsGuy, I thought you could manage time outs, here http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebDriver.Timeouts.html.
2011-08-29T09:53:24  <lukeis> that's different than webdriverwait... that's implicit wait
2011-08-29T09:53:26  <jarib> BenGrailsGuy: check out the methods inherited from FluentWait - you can configure the timeout and polling interval on the instance

2011-08-29T12:45:18  <krosenvold_> my bad
2011-08-29T12:45:26  <carlos> i was wondering if anyone has seen this - i just updated a suite of tests written for selenium 1.x java driver to selenium 2.5 using the WebDriverBackedSelenium.  one test was failing after the upgrade and it took me almost a day to figure out the thing that has triggered the problem.
2011-08-29T12:47:22  <carlos> the UI component being tested opens a confirm dialog if form data has changed when a submit button is clicked.
2011-08-29T12:47:56  <carlos>  the submit button's onclick even handler wasn't being triggerd when i updated form data using something like: selenium.type("name=inputOne", "this has been changed");
2011-08-29T12:48:21  <carlos> but worked just fine when i changed it to: getDriver().findElement(By.name("inputThree")).sendKeys("this has been changed");
2011-08-29T12:48:32  <carlos> is this type of behavior to be expected?

2011-08-29T13:18:20  <nirvdrum> Yes.  There was another issue with that one, whereby the thread could die and there was no process to monitor that.

2011-08-29T13:22:17  <nirvdrum> I really want to do a full audit of the thread safety of some of this stuff.  And I know in some places we enforce thread safety by only allowing single concurrent access, which kinda sucks because a concurrent collection would work just fine.
2011-08-29T13:22:38  <nirvdrum> But, alas, we do some other things like sorting, which CopyOnWriteArrayList hates.
2011-08-29T13:23:37  <krosenvold_> I think I've fixed COllections.synchronizedList() is better in most cases I think
2011-08-29T13:23:51  <krosenvold_> There has to be a high read ratio
2011-08-29T13:24:39  <nirvdrum> That was another problem, because it's usually a push / pop type thing, without actually being a stack.
2011-08-29T13:24:54  <nirvdrum> But I was willing to take a hit on read performance if multiple threads could concurrently update the list.

2011-08-29T17:15:02  <mydog2> hey...
2011-08-29T17:19:03  <mydog2> if i have a jscript that does a href, generate a new url, and fetch the new page.. is there a way that sel/java can capture the generated url?
2011-08-29T17:25:16  *** miker2 has joined #selenium
2011-08-29T17:26:23  <Nogem> are you having it fetch the url in browser?
2011-08-29T17:40:30  <mydog2> hey Nogem
2011-08-29T17:40:55  <mydog2> the javascript gets invoked via a foo.click()
2011-08-29T17:41:24  <mydog2> i can then get the source if i do a foo.printsource()
2011-08-29T17:41:50  <mydog2> but i'd like to get the actual query used to generate the new page/content..
2011-08-29T17:41:54  <Nogem> ok, so does it end up opened in a browser, specifically the one your sel instance is tied to
2011-08-29T17:42:25  <Nogem> ok, it's a click on an element
2011-08-29T17:42:29  <Nogem> just a second
2011-08-29T17:42:49  <mydog2> it should.. this is for a prob i'm grappling with.. haven't written the code yet.. but yeah..  the new page gets generated to a new tab in the browser when i manually do this
2011-08-29T17:44:01  <Nogem> try driver.findElement(By.linkText(linkId)).getAttribute("href");
2011-08-29T17:44:34  <Nogem> it'll be something along those lines, you have to find the element - likely the same way you did for the click - and access its properties
2011-08-29T17:45:52  <Nogem> if it's building dynamically on an event after the click you might try getting the current URL when it loads, but if the query isn't being done by url string you'll probably need an http trace or to handle the request through a different library
2011-08-29T17:46:34  <Nogem> make sense?
2011-08-29T17:46:40  <mydog2> Nogem,  - i can get the element...
2011-08-29T17:46:55  <mydog2> but the href is the javascript...
2011-08-29T17:47:27  <mydog2> when the javascript is clicked.. the javascript is invoked.. which then generates the page..
2011-08-29T17:47:52  <mydog2> in other words.. the javascript creates the url+query, and then submits it..
2011-08-29T17:48:39  <mydog2> i'm trying to figureout how to get the url+query <<
2011-08-29T17:50:13  <Nogem> Ok, is it passing the query as a header or a query string?
2011-08-29T17:53:06  <mydog2> i assume a querystring..

2011-08-29T18:26:48  <Nogem> if it is by query string then it'll be in the new page when it loads, use a WebDriver object to get the page (click the link)
2011-08-29T18:27:02  <Nogem> then try something like String thisUrl = driver.getCurrentUrl();
2011-08-29T18:32:19  <mydog2> Nogem,  - might work...

2011-08-29T23:55:12  <sdf> any idea what does it mean?
2011-08-29T23:56:34  <sdf> Ajay: with Selenium 1 it worked perfect
2011-08-29T23:56:50  <krosenvold_> dawagner: Do you have a code style template for idea ?
2011-08-29T23:57:06  <krosenvold_> And wtf /are/ the actual correct order of imports for this project ?
2011-08-29T23:57:13  <krosenvold_> There is no single value in use
2011-08-29T23:57:26  <dawagner> Yeah, I sent it to Simon to officially open source, I can email it to you
2011-08-29T23:57:33  <dawagner> What I used in my bulk formatting was:
2011-08-29T23:57:41  <ato> Can you send a copy to me as well?
2011-08-29T23:57:46  <dawagner> Will do
2011-08-29T23:58:00  <krosenvold_> commit it in the project somewhere ?
2011-08-29T23:58:08  <sdf> It is visible after JS interaction
2011-08-29T23:58:14  <dawagner> Simon will when he's got it cleared :)
2011-08-29T23:58:19  <sdf> Ajay: It is visible after JS interaction
2011-08-29T23:58:25  *** ceecee has left #selenium
2011-08-29T23:58:34  <sdf> maybe that is the reason
2011-08-29T23:58:56  <dawagner> Static: [com.google, com.thoughtworks.selenium, org.openqa.selenium, *], Non-static: [com.google, com.thoughtworks.selenium, org.openqa.selenium, *, java, javax]
2011-08-29T23:58:59  <krosenvold_> dawagner: If you check it in, I can just symlink to it and simon can update at will ;)
2011-08-29T23:59:15  <dawagner> Removing the special case com.google has been put forward and makes sense
2011-08-29T23:59:17  <krosenvold_> And where are all others ?
2011-08-29T23:59:43  <krosenvold_> dawagner: There is an xml file in idea you can check in ;)
2011-08-29T23:59:47  <dawagner> Everything else is in *, alphabetically in the standard way (i.e. upper case comes before lower case)
