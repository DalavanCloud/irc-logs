2011-02-24T04:41:25  *** nitin has quit IRC
2011-02-24T04:41:47  <jarib> that should be //input[@id='login']
2011-02-24T04:42:04  <jarib> or better, use By.id("login")
2011-02-24T04:42:10  <ato> XPath attributes are always prefixed with @.
2011-02-24T04:42:27  <gtailleb1> sure, my bad
2011-02-24T04:44:52  <gtailleb1> ok here is a new test that failed :
2011-02-24T04:45:18  <gtailleb1> remoteDriver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@name='connect']")).click(); => ok, no problem
2011-02-24T04:45:19  <gtailleb1> remoteDriver.findElement(By.name("connect")).click(); =>  org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: Unable to find element with name == connect
2011-02-24T04:46:01  <gtailleb1> but i could use By.name on the google homepage
2011-02-24T04:46:17  <gtailleb1> and not on my local website
2011-02-24T04:48:13  <gtailleb1> same problem with by.LinkText or with elements annotated @FindBy(linktext/name) and initialized via PageFactory
2011-02-24T04:51:04  <jarib> gtailleb1: is it specific to the IE driver?
2011-02-24T04:51:09  <gtailleb1> yep
2011-02-24T04:51:14  <jarib> so it works in firefox
2011-02-24T04:51:17  *** Mayank has joined #selenium
2011-02-24T04:51:26  <gtailleb1> i got no problem with the firefox driver, everything works fine
2011-02-24T04:52:03  <jarib> gtailleb1: file a bug and include a minimal test case with the Java/HTML/CSS/JS needed to reproduce the problem
2011-02-24T04:53:51  <gtailleb1> jarib : well the problem happens only on a local website we are developping and the html is really simple
2011-02-24T04:54:21  <jarib> it'll probably get fixed very quickly then

2011-02-24T04:57:43  <gtailleb1> ok
2011-02-24T04:58:18  <gtailleb1> hum not ok sorry, how do you do that?
2011-02-24T04:58:47  <AutomatedTester> gtailleb1: at the bottom of the page there is 6 boxes

2011-02-24T08:46:23  <jimevans> s'up?
2011-02-24T08:46:45  <dawagner> I'm getting a problem with the IE driver on a page using the underscore javascript library
2011-02-24T08:47:04  <dawagner> I'm reducing to a minimal test case, but wondering if there are known issues
2011-02-24T08:47:12  *** Putr has joined #selenium
2011-02-24T08:47:36  <jimevans> ok. i'm unfamiliar with the library, but no, i'm unaware of glaring problems with javascript libraries and the IE driver.
2011-02-24T08:48:58  <jimevans> there's been a little churn in that area within the last month, as I added some code to return objects and handle arrays in a way similar to the firefox driver
2011-02-24T08:49:15  <dawagner> Underscore dumps a bunch of functionality on a global variable named _ - I'm getting an error message that _ doesn't contain a function that is being called on it... Thinking that maybe when we inject javascript we trample on the name somehow
2011-02-24T08:50:16  <jimevans> it's possible. i can think of three places that might be happening.
2011-02-24T08:50:40  <jimevans> (1) somewhere in the atoms, (2) the sizzle library, or (3) the javascript xpath library.
2011-02-24T08:50:55  <dawagner> All of which are super fun to debug :D
2011-02-24T08:51:05  <AutomatedTester> dawagner: is there noConflict() type thing for _
2011-02-24T08:51:22  <jimevans> in the act of simply injecting and running javascript, we don't do anything special using '_' that I know of.
2011-02-24T08:51:53  <dawagner> AutomatedTester: Looks like there is :) Having a look now
2011-02-24T08:53:14  * RossPatterson thought everyone learned the lesson of not using magic short variable names from jQuery and "$".
2011-02-24T08:53:41  <AutomatedTester> dawagner: if that solves it we should do that on sizzle and others
2011-02-24T08:54:49  *** Putr has quit IRC
2011-02-24T08:54:53  <AutomatedTester> plus its good practise to that anyway because 3rd party widgets could fubar your site
2011-02-24T08:55:51  <jimevans> dawagner: for what it's worth, each of the atoms contains at the end "return _.apply(null,arguments)"
2011-02-24T08:56:14  <AutomatedTester> doh
2011-02-24T08:56:15  <dawagner> That will probably be the problem then

2011-02-24T09:59:12  *** jxpx777 has joined #selenium
2011-02-24T09:59:16  <jimevans> rolando__: selenium/webdriver is probably not the best tool for something like that.
2011-02-24T10:00:49  <jimevans> unless you have a set of test web pages that will send the payload you wish to test.
2011-02-24T10:01:31  <rolando__> I see
2011-02-24T10:02:00  <rolando__> We are starting to use selenium to test our ui, but we like to test our rest-like api too with the same tool
2011-02-24T10:03:21  <jimevans> why? selenium is very good at testing the ui, but why try to force it into a use case it's not well-suited to?
2011-02-24T10:03:51  <rolando__> I think the same, but my boss ask me to check it out :)
2011-02-24T10:04:03  <jimevans> are you using selenium ide?
2011-02-24T10:04:32  <jimevans> if so, are you exporting your scripts to a language like java or c#?
2011-02-24T10:04:45  <rolando__> I'm using python driver
2011-02-24T10:04:54  *** antlong has joined #selenium
2011-02-24T10:05:25  <jimevans> then you already have what you need. python should have an http client (someone who knows python should be able to shed more light)
2011-02-24T10:06:00  *** esteele|away is now known as esteele
2011-02-24T10:06:01  <jimevans> you can use the python driver to test your ui, and the python http client to craft custom http requests to test your rest api.
2011-02-24T10:06:17  <rolando__> that's it
2011-02-24T10:08:08  <jimevans> since you're developing your tests in a programming language (as opposed to recording them in selenium ide), you can use the facilities of that language to your advantage.
2011-02-24T10:08:25  <jimevans> that's a Good Thing (TM).
2011-02-24T10:08:40  <antlong> rolando__, what are you trying to do
2011-02-24T10:09:37  <jimevans> antlong: he's got a REST api that needs testing in addition to the UI of his web app.
2011-02-24T10:10:07  <jimevans> the python driver is a good fit for testing the ui, but not so much for the REST api.
2011-02-24T10:10:49  <antlong> doable, but assbackwards
2011-02-24T10:11:03  <jimevans> antlong: how so?
2011-02-24T10:11:05  <antlong> look at do_command(), that should get you going
2011-02-24T10:11:06  <rolando__> in case of using selenium server, the api requests will go from the ip where is running the tests than the selenium server, right?
2011-02-24T10:11:52  <rolando__> antlong, currently writing test for UI, but wanted to write tests using selenium for the rest-like api (perform post requests and parse json response)
2011-02-24T10:11:53  <antlong> jimevans, you can modify do_command to make a http request directly but that wouldnt make sense since you can just use the same exact method (in do_command)
2011-02-24T10:11:54  <jimevans> rolando__: for the rest api, or the ui test?
2011-02-24T10:13:04  <jimevans> antlong: that was my advice. don't use selenium to test the REST api, use a direct HTTP request (he said, not knowing python's standard library).
2011-02-24T10:13:33  <rolando__> jimevans, I know how to do http requests using python libs
2011-02-24T10:13:34  <jimevans> if it was .NET, i'd say use HttpWebRequest directly against the server for the REST api tests.
2011-02-24T10:13:53  <rolando__> that's clear. thanks
2011-02-24T10:14:09  <antlong> rolando__, json.dumps(urllib2.urlopen('http://google.com').read())
2011-02-24T10:15:00  <jimevans> then it sounds like you're golden. to answer your other question, you're bypassing the selenium server altogether, so yes, the api requests would come directly from the test machine's ip.

2011-02-24T10:28:29  <fission6> i am running the following, sudo Xvfb :7 -ac -screen 0 1024x768x8  in on terminal, in another terminal export DISPLAY=":99" and in that same terminal i run standalong selenium server, and finally in a new terminal i run a script which connects to the server and runs firefox tests
2011-02-24T10:28:35  <fission6> antlong:  thanks
2011-02-24T10:28:42  *** jxpx777 has quit IRC
2011-02-24T10:29:04  <jarib> fission6: why DISPLAY=:99 and not DISPLAY=:7
2011-02-24T10:29:41  <fission6> sorry i mean display=:7
2011-02-24T10:29:46  <fission6> i get these warnings form xvfb
2011-02-24T10:29:51  <jarib> ok
2011-02-24T10:29:53  <fission6> (EE) AIGLX error: dlopen of /usr/X11/lib/dri/swrast_dri.so failed (dlopen(/usr/X11/lib/dri/swrast_dri.so, 5): image not found) (EE) GLX: could not load software renderer
2011-02-24T10:30:17  <jarib> so Xvfb crashes with that?
2011-02-24T10:30:35  <jarib> or..?
2011-02-24T10:30:49  <jarib> just warnings?
2011-02-24T10:31:26  <rolando__> antlong, seems so. 1.0.10
2011-02-24T10:31:40  <jarib> fission6: if you have the server running, do `cat /proc/<pid of server>/environ | tr '\0' '\n' | grep DISPLAY`
2011-02-24T10:31:47  <fission6> jarib: http://pastie.org/1603165 looks like just a warning, the daemon seems to stay open
2011-02-24T10:32:29  <fission6> how should i get the pid of the server
2011-02-24T10:32:44  <jarib> `jps -lm` to list java processes
2011-02-24T10:33:13  <jarib> (for all processes, check `man ps`)
2011-02-24T10:33:52  <rolando__> How do I click OK in a js confirmation popup?
2011-02-24T10:33:54  <fission6> there is no directory cat /proc ...
2011-02-24T10:34:08  <jarib> what operating system?
2011-02-24T10:34:11  <fission6> macos
2011-02-24T10:34:14  <jarib> oh
2011-02-24T10:34:18  <jarib> ok
2011-02-24T10:34:40  <jarib> not sure about X stuff on OS X
2011-02-24T10:34:56  <jarib> why do you want to run Xvfb on OS X?
2011-02-24T10:35:10  *** lfryc_ has quit IRC
2011-02-24T10:36:55  <fission6> so test and see how it works and then use it on an actual server without a UI
2011-02-24T10:37:06  <fission6> and its pissing me off that its not working
2011-02-24T10:38:12  <jarib> fission6: it's probably a lot harder to get working on OS X than on linux
2011-02-24T10:38:29  <jarib> i'd just play with it in a linux VM if i were you
2011-02-24T10:38:40  <fission6> hmm ok
2011-02-24T10:38:57  <jarib> don't waste time making it work on a platform you won't use it on
2011-02-24T10:39:28  <jarib> fission6: i use the tightvnc package on linux instead of Xvfb directly
2011-02-24T10:39:37  <jarib> which has some obvious benefits
2011-02-24T10:39:48  <fission6> how is your setup?
2011-02-24T10:42:06  <rolando__> anybody knows if in the python driver the class selenium.selenium is deprecated?
2011-02-24T10:42:45  <antlong> rolando__ what...
2011-02-24T10:43:34  <rolando__> in the python driver, there is a selenium/selenium.py which has a class called selenium
2011-02-24T10:43:43  <antlong> thats selenium...
2011-02-24T10:44:07  <rolando__> I'm not using that, i'm using selenium.webdriver.Remote
2011-02-24T10:44:37  <rolando__> the former has some methods that the latter lacks of
2011-02-24T10:44:41  <jarib> fission6: a server running debian, with a ruby master process controlling a queue of forked tests, ~35 firefoxes in parallel, each with their ovn VNC/X server
2011-02-24T10:44:57  <antlong> rolando__, yeah because youre not using selenium, are you
2011-02-24T10:45:05  <jarib> and each X display is being recorded by an ffmpeg process as well
2011-02-24T10:45:07  <antlong> youre using ---------
2011-02-24T10:45:13  <fission6> why 35 firfoxes in parralle
2011-02-24T10:45:25  <antlong> why not
2011-02-24T10:45:37  <jarib> to reduce the wall clock time?
2011-02-24T10:46:53  <fission6> jarib: do you use any other web application test suites / approaches?
2011-02-24T10:47:41  <jarib> not sure what you mean
2011-02-24T10:48:37  <jarib> besides browser tests?
2011-02-24T10:49:07  <fission6> besides selenium
2011-02-24T10:50:14  <jarib> our stack is basically cucumber -> watir-webdriver (ruby wrapper) -> selenium-webdriver (Se2 ruby bindings)

2011-02-24T10:52:31  <jarib> with cucumber it's all about involving the customer/business side in defining acceptance criteria, which is always a challenge

2011-02-24T10:54:06  <fission6> how large is the webapp your supporting

2011-02-24T10:58:52  <jarib> fission6: it's a norwegian classified ads site
2011-02-24T10:59:00  <fission6> nice
2011-02-24T10:59:14  <fission6> and yru tests just simulate user clicks and page requests etc
2011-02-24T10:59:14  <jarib> sort of like craigslist but prettier and non-free ;)
2011-02-24T10:59:50  <jarib> i guess that's one way to put it
2011-02-24T11:00:04  <fission6> do you find yourself testing for certain elements on a page?
2011-02-24T11:00:14  *** AutomatedTester has quit IRC
2011-02-24T11:00:27  <jarib> i guess so? in what sense?
2011-02-24T11:01:20  <fission6> just making sure certain divs exist, certain text is present, etc..

2011-02-24T11:15:42  <antlong> seems like i cant use xpaths with parens in the beginning
2011-02-24T11:17:11  <jarib> fission6: our payment solution was failing for some specific areas of the app. turned out to be a caching / thread-safety bug. we probably wouldn't have found it if it wasn't for the browser tests
2011-02-24T11:17:25  <fission6> antlog i have something liek this which works, sel.select("xpath=(//div/select[@name='attribute'])[1]"
2011-02-24T11:17:27  <jarib> that was yesterday
2011-02-24T11:17:43  <fission6> how did the browser tests surface it?
2011-02-24T11:17:52  <fission6> like what was the test? filling a form out or osmething?
2011-02-24T11:18:08  <jarib> yeah
2011-02-24T11:18:18  <fission6> were you getting like 500's or something?
2011-02-24T11:18:28  <fission6> what was the response/test which raised the failure
2011-02-24T11:18:39  <jarib> it's a page where you select a payment option (credit card, etc.). the payment options were all wrong
2011-02-24T11:18:39  <fission6> by the way this is encourage to here success stories for QA
2011-02-24T11:19:06  <fission6> what was the specific test, like searching for credit card in the page or something?
2011-02-24T11:19:16  <fission6> like a text search? an element search? etc
2011-02-24T11:19:25  <fission6> select or option search which failed?

2011-02-24T11:22:55  <fission6> cool thats great stuff
2011-02-24T11:23:02  <fission6> one last question, how do you report on your test runs?
2011-02-24T11:23:12  <fission6> like via emails? dashboard? etc
2011-02-24T11:23:19  <fission6> how do you get your "feedback"
2011-02-24T11:23:44  *** ryzer-afk has joined #selenium
2011-02-24T11:24:07  <RossPatterson> antlong: Se1 won't recognize "((..." as an XPath locator.  You need to use "xpath=((..." instead.
2011-02-24T11:26:37  <jarib> fission6: we've mostly used the reporting provided by cucumber, but i'm working on a custom app to integrate more of the data we have
2011-02-24T11:27:37  <jarib> the way it works now it is more like a dashboard, where you can see tests being queued and results pop in as soon as they're done
2011-02-24T11:28:16  <fission6> thats coool
2011-02-24T11:28:17  <jarib> and i just added videos, which everyone loves of course :)
2011-02-24T11:28:20  <fission6> how often do your tests run
2011-02-24T11:28:48  <jarib> not as often as i'd like
2011-02-24T11:28:57  <jarib> once or twice a day
2011-02-24T11:29:25  <fission6> how are they triggered?
2011-02-24T11:29:31  <fission6> on a build? cron?
2011-02-24T11:29:33  <fission6> manually?
2011-02-24T11:30:32  <jarib> it's a legacy app with a huge db. so around midnight it starts loading a fresh db dump from production
2011-02-24T11:30:40  <jarib> which takes some ours
2011-02-24T11:30:47  <jarib> *hours
2011-02-24T11:31:27  *** karlwett1n has quit IRC
2011-02-24T11:31:31  <jarib> then it will run all the deploy scripts, including db changes etc
2011-02-24T11:32:15  <jarib> so we're basically doing a nightly release to a production-like internal environment
2011-02-24T11:33:00  <jarib> after launching the main app + supporting services, it will queue up a test run
2011-02-24T11:33:46  <jarib> the db is really the main problem
2011-02-24T11:34:44  <fission6> very interesting

2011-02-24T11:34:55  <fission6> sounds like a pretty good start
2011-02-24T11:35:10  <jarib> yeah. getting there, hopefully :)
2011-02-24T11:35:16  <ato> For us too.  The result database, for instance, gets several gigabytes bigger by just adding an integer column.
2011-02-24T11:35:25  <fission6> thanks for yoru insight jarib
2011-02-24T11:35:39  <jarib> fission6: anytime :)
2011-02-24T11:36:05  <ato> jarib: You said results gets reported back; does that happen immediately after each test, or at the end of each test run?
2011-02-24T11:36:44  <jarib> immediately for each unit of work (which right now maps to a cucumber feature)

2011-02-24T12:09:58  <plightbo> ah, seems like that should be Simon Stewart
2011-02-24T12:10:02  <bkuhn> The Rep's job is just to communicate.
2011-02-24T12:10:04  *** cpg|away is now known as cpg
2011-02-24T12:10:13  <bkuhn> That's fine, I don't really care who it is necessarily, but you all have to elect one and tell me who it is. :)
2011-02-24T12:10:31  <bkuhn> I won't spend your money, etc. until you the Rep says: "The project says 'spend money on Foo'"
2011-02-24T12:11:05  <bkuhn> plightbo: would you mind picking up the thread from one of the few times I've asked and get that going?
2011-02-24T12:11:18  <jarib> csgeekAlterEgo: not sure about RC/Se1, but for a regular laptop these days (dual core, 4GB RAM) seems to handle around 4-5 firefoxes before things get shaky
2011-02-24T12:11:26  <bkuhn> plightbo: I think I've mentioned it as an aside in three different emails over the last few weeks, so it should be easy to find one and pick it up. :)
2011-02-24T12:11:54  <plightbo> bkuhn: yes, I will get this issue resolved quickly
2011-02-24T12:11:58  <bkuhn> Thanks!.
2011-02-24T12:12:02  <bkuhn> so, next item:
2011-02-24T12:12:23  <bkuhn> plightbo: ISTR you had the adwords account set up to go to you, and you put it on "hiatus" or something so the money wouldn't go into your acct automatically.
2011-02-24T12:12:34  <plightbo> correct
2011-02-24T12:12:36  <bkuhn> We should set that up to go to Conservancy ... what's the easiest way for you to do that?
2011-02-24T12:12:41  <plightbo> it's still building up, let me check balance right now
2011-02-24T12:13:01  <plightbo> easiest thing to me is to just get it to deposit in to Conservancy bank account?
2011-02-24T12:13:04  <bkuhn> plightbo: If you want, I can just take over the account on behalf of Selenium; you'll see the money in the financial reports monthly.  But, if you want to stay more hands on with it, that's ok.
2011-02-24T12:13:12  <plightbo> unfortunately, AdWords doesn't have a concept of allowing multiple admins/logins to the account
2011-02-24T12:13:17  <bkuhn> Yeah, i know.
2011-02-24T12:13:19  <plightbo> and it's linked under my plighbto@gmail.com login
2011-02-24T12:13:20  <bkuhn> so we could both have login access.
2011-02-24T12:13:23  <bkuhn> oh!!!
2011-02-24T12:13:25  <bkuhn> that sucks. :-/
2011-02-24T12:13:39  <bkuhn> which means if you gave me the login, I can read your personal mail. :)
2011-02-24T12:13:41  <plightbo> i can hand over to you, but we'd have to coordinate it with updating the site to use the new ad token
2011-02-24T12:13:45  <plightbo> :)
2011-02-24T12:13:57  <plightbo> which isn't a huge problem, but requires more coordination than I can commit to this exact moment
2011-02-24T12:14:03  <bkuhn> plightbo: So, I'm trying to think through any reason I actually need the account.
2011-02-24T12:14:10  <plightbo> oh wait, one sec - i think i might be wrong
2011-02-24T12:14:16  <bkuhn> I suppose there isn't.  No money *but* ad words related revenue comes through it, right?
2011-02-24T12:14:18  <plightbo> getting AdWords vs AdSense
2011-02-24T12:14:20  <plightbo> stand by
2011-02-24T12:14:25  * bkuhn doesn't know the difference. :-/
2011-02-24T12:14:26  <plightbo> correct
2011-02-24T12:14:46  <plightbo> $8,333.70Estimated unpaid earnings
2011-02-24T12:14:50  <plightbo> so that's what is building up
2011-02-24T12:14:53  <bkuhn> ok.
2011-02-24T12:15:25  <bkuhn> So, I just realized, the worry in giving you the account info is it could allow you to withdraw from Conservancy's checking account.
2011-02-24T12:15:40  <bkuhn> It's not that I don't trust you, but it would be against Conservancy's fiscal control policies, I think.
2011-02-24T12:15:44  <plightbo> i hear ya
2011-02-24T12:15:53  <bkuhn> (meaning, you could set up google checkout associated with the account, then take money)
2011-02-24T12:15:53  <plightbo> so AdSense has this in the admin panel:
2011-02-24T12:15:57  <plightbo> "Users with sign-in access: plightbo@gmail.com"
2011-02-24T12:16:04  <plightbo> which would imply other people could be granted sign-in access
2011-02-24T12:16:07  <bkuhn> hmm.
2011-02-24T12:16:14  <plightbo> but I can't find an "Edit" link anywhere :P
2011-02-24T12:16:27  <bkuhn> plightbo: well, if you can try adding <accounting@sfconservancy.org> .. that's the email addr I have associated with Google for Conservancy.
2011-02-24T12:17:22  <plightbo> http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/AdSense/thread?tid=4dcdad868db663dd&hl=en
2011-02-24T12:17:24  <plightbo> that answers that
2011-02-24T12:18:21  <bkuhn> plightbo: so, do you use adwords or adsense (and is there a URL that tells me the difference?)
2011-02-24T12:18:44  <plightbo> we're using AdSense
2011-02-24T12:18:50  <plightbo> AdWords is for posting ads on google.com
2011-02-24T12:18:55  <bkuhn> ah, ok.
2011-02-24T12:19:01  <bkuhn> So, it's an AdWords account that Conservancy has.
2011-02-24T12:19:04  <bkuhn> Which we don't use.
2011-02-24T12:19:24  <bkuhn> it's just that they offer gratis Adwords (up to some limit) for 501(c)(3)'s, and you have to be signed up there to get the gratis Google Checkout services.
2011-02-24T12:19:42  <bkuhn> and it's the latter we care about, I think I logged into the Conservancy AdWords only once, to hook up Google Checkout to it to make that gratis. :)
2011-02-24T12:19:59  <plightbo> (one sec, just got a work call)
2011-02-24T12:21:29  <bkuhn> plightbo: ok, and it seems from that URL you posted that there's no way to "transfer the account".  So, I think we should probably table this while we think about the solution.  One idea might be to have Conservancy create an adsense account, and have you change the adsense key on seleniumhq.org.  Another is if we can do "one time" payments and delete the info after the payment goes through each time.  A third is maybe there's a way
2011-02-24T12:21:29  <bkuhn> specify a separate Google Checkout account as the recipient (then it could go to Conservancy's Google chekcout acct by email)

2011-02-24T12:51:07  <plightbo> bkuhn: ok, perfect
2011-02-24T12:51:13  <bkuhn> Once you guys approve that, Ashley and I can do most of the conference stuff independently.
2011-02-24T12:51:29  <bkuhn> I'm in a bit of a bind now because I'm talking to her about stuff that hasn't been officially approved.
2011-02-24T12:51:30  <plightbo> bkuhn: oh, there was one thing on my end - Sauce Labs accrued about $6K in legal bills from back when they were trying to set up a standalone non-profit
2011-02-24T12:51:39  <bkuhn> Getting the Rep sorted out will help.
2011-02-24T12:51:43  <plightbo> i had mentioned in the past that Selenium should pay those bills, so John asked that we pay them back
2011-02-24T12:52:13  <bkuhn> plightbo: oh, ok.  Well, get the Rep set  up.  Once the Rep is set up, the Rep can coordinate approving that (or any other) expense that Selenium wants to pay for.   In parallel, John can send me the receipt.
2011-02-24T12:52:16  <plightbo> so when thinking about budget, consider the +$8K in AdSense and the +~$3K that I still need to hand over, but also the -$6K to Sauce 

2011-02-24T12:52:57  <bkuhn> ... I'll hold the receipt until you tell me who the rep is and then send it for approval. (my usual MO is to write To: the rep, cc'ing the project addr, so there's transparency, but I expect the rep to tell me the "official" answer, although others are welcome to say their opinions)
2011-02-24T12:53:00  <bkuhn> plightbo: ^
2011-02-24T12:53:27  <plightbo> cool
2011-02-24T12:53:28  <plightbo> sounds good
2011-02-24T12:53:42  <bkuhn> The important thing about the Rep: it needs to be someone who has time to be responsive.
2011-02-24T12:54:06  <bkuhn> I'm very careful not to spend money without Project approval, but the downside to that is sometimes expenses don't get paid because The Rep isn't rallying for a vote or whatever's needed to get an expense approved.
2011-02-24T12:54:18  * bkuhn has been through this before.
