2011-09-01T02:31:09  <krosenvold_> So it works on newer browsers..?
2011-09-01T02:31:15  <jarib> yeah
2011-09-01T02:31:33  <jarib> at least Firefox 6
2011-09-01T02:31:33  <krosenvold_> I have so many problems with intellij debugger freezing any ff > 3
2011-09-01T02:31:50  <jarib> huh
2011-09-01T02:32:11  <krosenvold_> When I stop on a breakpoint inside a running java test and try to activate firebug, firefox hangs
2011-09-01T02:32:18  <krosenvold_> Only when I stop *intellij* on breakpoint
2011-09-01T02:32:45  <krosenvold_> Now I've seen some weird stuff in my life but this is world-record contender
2011-09-01T02:32:53  <jarib> hehe
2011-09-01T02:32:56  <jarib> that is odd indeed
2011-09-01T02:33:16  <krosenvold_> I think there must be some socket keepalive thread that is suspended by the debugger
2011-09-01T02:33:32  <krosenvold_> BUt that's only because it's the only darn thing I can find even remotely likely
2011-09-01T02:33:36  <krosenvold_> Divine intervention next
2011-09-01T02:34:10  <jarib> why would a java thread affect firebug though
2011-09-01T02:34:33  <krosenvold_> I'm thinking firefox expects some kind of http keepalive from the connected process
2011-09-01T02:34:38  <krosenvold_> And the debugger deprives it of it
2011-09-01T02:34:40  <jarib> ah
2011-09-01T02:34:40  <krosenvold_> Somehow
2011-09-01T02:34:54  <krosenvold_> It's probably firebug

2011-09-01T03:04:38  <ato> jarib: That won't work on SVG documents, XML documents, XHTML documents, though.

2011-09-01T03:04:59  <ato> And proprietary formats.
2011-09-01T03:05:08  * ato curses Opera's third-party Widget formats.
2011-09-01T03:06:02  <jarib> i don't getting "visible text" from SVG/XML documents is something webdriver purports to do
2011-09-01T03:06:22  <jarib> *don't think
2011-09-01T03:07:15  <ato> jarib: Well, it breaks other stuff as well.
2011-09-01T03:08:05  <jarib> but :root works ok except it includes the title?
2011-09-01T03:08:13  <jarib> if so you could probably just fix the atom
2011-09-01T03:08:41  <ato> jarib: We're basically defining Window#document to CSS' :root, and using that for everything related to querying the document.  This includes getText, but also stuff like getting the visual hash (which is OperaDriver only) for an element in a document (which we typically do in SVG documents).
2011-09-01T03:08:59  <ato> Also, Chrome and Firefox behave differently.
2011-09-01T03:09:14  <ato> Okay.  So it's probably fine if I fix it to behave like Firefox?
2011-09-01T03:09:14  <jarib> actually, it has a todo

2011-09-01T03:30:15  <freynaud> krosenvold_: while you're on httpClient
2011-09-01T03:30:25  <freynaud> what do you think about adding time outs on it ?
2011-09-01T03:31:08  <freynaud> i have the following case blocking me : if a command never returns ( usually when using fancy JS ) , the driver is stuck
2011-09-01T03:31:30  <krosenvold_> SO_TIMEOUT ?
2011-09-01T03:31:34  <freynaud> because a session on the driver side can only handle one request at a time, i can never send a quit command, and it's stuck
2011-09-01T03:31:54  <freynaud> however, the timeout should only be on specific commands, or configurable
2011-09-01T03:32:22  <freynaud> the newSession request can sits there for hours waiting for a  browser to be available and still be valid
2011-09-01T03:32:22  <krosenvold_> Would SO_TIMEOUT as a general solution do the trick ?
2011-09-01T03:33:11  <freynaud> on the remotewebdriver code, it should work if you exclude the new session command yes
2011-09-01T03:33:19  * krosenvold_ has too think about that one
2011-09-01T03:33:59  <freynaud> one example I think shows the problem is on a firefox with wrong SLL certificates
2011-09-01T03:34:27  <krosenvold_> BUt how is that going to help, isn't it still going to be wrong the next time ?
2011-09-01T03:34:32  <freynaud> if you reach a page like that, you have the oups exception grey page. If you try to excecute some JS there, your driver is dead.
2011-09-01T03:34:50  <freynaud> at least you can kill the browser
2011-09-01T03:35:01  <freynaud> and you unstuck the situation
2011-09-01T03:35:27  <freynaud> your test fails, that's normal. But having a dead browser on the grid that cannot be recovered isn't right

2011-09-01T04:36:53  <krosenvold_> Just a very "user" like question; when deploying grid, does the hub need to "see" the remotes, network wise, or is all the comms initiated from the remotes
2011-09-01T04:37:07  <krosenvold_> I have an ugly firewall
2011-09-01T04:37:21  <nirvdrum> The nodes register with the hub.
2011-09-01T04:37:33  <nirvdrum> The hub then knows about the nodes via its registry.
2011-09-01T04:37:42  <krosenvold_> Yes, and the connections are always initiated from the nodes, right?
2011-09-01T04:38:03  <krosenvold_> I know I should read the code
2011-09-01T04:38:18  <nirvdrum> The registration requests are.  But when the hub assigns a client to a node that traffic is initiated through from the hub.
2011-09-01T04:38:32  <krosenvold_> So firewall needs to be open both ways. Damn
2011-09-01T04:38:34  <nirvdrum> The registration connection is not persistent.
2011-09-01T04:39:04  <nirvdrum> It'd almost certainly timeout anyway, unless we did some keepalive stuff.
2011-09-01T04:39:37  <krosenvold_> Well, I'm going through port-forwarding ssh tunnels today so I need to keep them for my grid
2011-09-01T04:40:30  <krosenvold_> We'll be switching to grid when 2.6 is released and I'm doing deployment planning ;)
2011-09-01T04:41:43  <krosenvold_> One thing I dont understand though is how you guys have been able to keep a 200 node grid up with all the threading issues I've been fixing

2011-09-01T05:14:41  <jimevans> g'day simonstewart
2011-09-01T05:14:58  <simonstewart> Landed the big update to selenium at google last night
2011-09-01T05:15:04  <simonstewart> That's been burning a lot of my time
2011-09-01T05:15:11  <simonstewart> Thankfully, it's done now
2011-09-01T05:15:19  * jimevans does an svn up
2011-09-01T05:15:42  <simonstewart> So, how close are we to being able to push 2.6, if we wanted to?
2011-09-01T05:15:54  <simonstewart> I'm just about to bump version numbers.
2011-09-01T05:16:31  <jimevans> i don't know how quickly i'd be able to get tests run. my laptop had to go back to dell with a dodgy usb port.
2011-09-01T05:16:39  <simonstewart> ok
2011-09-01T05:16:44  <simonstewart> I'll start working on something here, then
2011-09-01T05:16:55  <simonstewart> Are you on your MBP now?

2011-09-01T05:17:15  <jimevans> but it doesn't have the vm's installed yet. :(
2011-09-01T05:17:24  <simonstewart> OK. If you can run the IE tests with your local IE then that'll be a good sanity check
2011-09-01T05:17:29  <jimevans> i can haz ie9 testing though.
2011-09-01T05:17:41  <simonstewart> I never fixed that test you pointed out
2011-09-01T05:17:46  <simonstewart> Did you land a fix?
2011-09-01T05:17:50  <jimevans> the jquery bit?
2011-09-01T05:17:52  <jimevans> not yet.

2011-09-01T05:18:16  <jimevans> ah. ok.
2011-09-01T05:18:23  <jimevans> i'm looking at two issues right now.
2011-09-01T05:18:50  <jimevans> #1613
2011-09-01T05:18:51  <selbot2>  open/new Internet Explorer crashes when typing unicode character (accent aigu) - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1613 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Component-WebDriver Browser-IE]
2011-09-01T05:19:01  <simonstewart> hahaha. That's bad
2011-09-01T05:19:05  <simonstewart> How did it get there?
2011-09-01T05:19:13  <jimevans> it's been there all along.
2011-09-01T05:19:24  <jimevans> the problem is in the interactions code
2011-09-01T05:19:45  <simonstewart> grief
2011-09-01T05:19:50  <jimevans> ie reacts badly to wm_keydown and wm_keyup messages where the wparam is -1.
2011-09-01T05:19:53  <simonstewart> I thought we had that stuff mostly stable
2011-09-01T05:20:02  <jimevans> it doesn't happen on every website.
2011-09-01T05:20:04  <simonstewart> I can see that being problematic
2011-09-01T05:20:23  <jimevans> i honestly don't know what the commonality is on websites where it does happen, but i think i've got a fix for it.
2011-09-01T05:20:42  <krosenvold_> simonstewart: atoms tests are failing on ff3 here
2011-09-01T05:20:47  <jimevans> i did, however, want to ping eran about it, since he's more familiar with that code than i am.
2011-09-01T05:21:05  <simonstewart> I wrote a ton of the Windows code
2011-09-01T05:21:18  <simonstewart> krosenvold_: thanks for the heads up
2011-09-01T05:21:19  <Parabola> Good morning folks
2011-09-01T05:21:41  <Parabola> So, I know this isnt anyones problem but my own, but you guys have never lead me wrong :)
2011-09-01T05:22:01  <Ajay> simonstewart:hi
2011-09-01T05:22:21  <jimevans> i've run the .net tests against ie with the change, and i'm pretty sure my change wouldn't adversely affect anything else. i may just commit and ask for forgiveness if anything breaks.
2011-09-01T05:22:25  <Parabola> as I've mentioned, i'm still very new to programming, and I was introduced by someone in here to using a testing framework (java) instead of what i was doing, which was basically writing my own framework for testing
2011-09-01T05:22:27  <simonstewart> Greetings, Ajay
2011-09-01T05:22:31  <Ajay> whats the process of updtaing the java jars , we are ages behind in  Junit
2011-09-01T05:22:55  <Parabola> I have been reading the documentation for testNG.. however I'm not really getting the big picture :-\
2011-09-01T05:23:19  <simonstewart> Ajay: we've got (almost) the latest junit jars checked in
2011-09-01T05:23:23  <Parabola> I was hoping someone would be able to spare a minute or two to answer a couple of questions regarding overall design and what i'm actually trying to achieve
2011-09-01T05:23:31  <simonstewart> The problem is that we've not yet made the switch to using the junit4 syntax
2011-09-01T05:23:53  <Ajay> i found few apache jars lagging behind versions
2011-09-01T05:23:55  <freynaud> Parabola: ask your questions
2011-09-01T05:23:59  <Parabola> great :)
2011-09-01T05:24:00  <krosenvold_> there's a slight problem with junit 4.9
2011-09-01T05:24:13  <simonstewart> Which is?"
2011-09-01T05:24:23  <krosenvold_> They packaged hamcrest in the regular jar
2011-09-01T05:24:31  <Ajay> sure ?
2011-09-01T05:24:38  <simonstewart> I thought Saff had fixed that?
2011-09-01T05:24:41  <selbot2> simon.m.stewart less than 20 seconds ago - SimonStewart: Bumping the version numbers - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=13683
2011-09-01T05:24:51  <krosenvold_> Maybe the download version
2011-09-01T05:25:05  <krosenvold_> simonstewart: Did you just tag the release version ?
2011-09-01T05:25:11  <Parabola> so i'm reading this documentation, and I'm getting that you annotate your code bits that you want to have it run, and you can do it via ant, eclipse or an XML file. but what I don't get is how does it know if my code is working? I remember with jUnit seeing "assertEquals(3, foo)" or something like that
2011-09-01T05:25:16  <Ajay> we are using junit-dep** jars right ?
2011-09-01T05:25:16  <simonstewart> Nope.
2011-09-01T05:25:20  <simonstewart> Just bumped the version numbers
2011-09-01T05:25:27  <simonstewart> Still need to run the tests

2011-09-01T05:26:08  <simonstewart> Which one
2011-09-01T05:26:21  <Parabola> the reason I ask, is I installed the testNG eclipse plugin, and put some @test annotations on some things and they fail with null pointers
2011-09-01T05:26:26  <krosenvold_> simonstewart: Stefan Birkner
2011-09-01T05:26:45  <krosenvold_> He has a middle name
2011-09-01T05:26:47  <simonstewart> He's not signed the SFC CLA
2011-09-01T05:27:07  <Parabola> I think part of my problem is probobly the way my code is designed
2011-09-01T05:27:12  <Parabola> but i'm not sure where to go from here :-\
2011-09-01T05:27:18  <simonstewart> Or the old google code one
2011-09-01T05:27:37  <krosenvold_> simonstewart: Now the question, I rebased a 1.5 year old patch he did and was able to re-use about 2 lines of code from a unit test
2011-09-01T05:27:45  <krosenvold_> The rest I just re-fixed
2011-09-01T05:27:51  <simonstewart> Are those two lines of unit test obvious?
2011-09-01T05:28:05  <krosenvold_> Well they reveal a problem ;)
2011-09-01T05:28:05  <simonstewart> Would you have written them yourself?

2011-09-01T05:28:20  <krosenvold_> simonstewart: I have no idea ;)
2011-09-01T05:28:41  <simonstewart> 2 lines is probably okay
2011-09-01T05:28:47  <simonstewart> But if in doubt we can look at them
2011-09-01T05:29:00  <simonstewart> biab

2011-09-01T05:30:50  <Ajay> Parabola: Can u paste u r code
2011-09-01T05:30:58  <Ajay> what did u run as ?
2011-09-01T05:31:03  * krosenvold_ has to be watched or he'll make everything @Immutable ;)
2011-09-01T05:31:06  <freynaud> krosenvold_: the URL is not always known when you create a proxy. If you have a VM for the node, and the proxy is responsible for booting it, you'll have the url only after the proxy is built + listener called
2011-09-01T05:31:07  <Ajay> did u as TestNg test ?
2011-09-01T05:31:17  <Parabola> Ajay: yeah i created a new run config under testNG
2011-09-01T05:31:40  <Parabola> Ajay: my issue is probobly because my code was designed around the framework i had been writing from scratch, due to ignorance

2011-09-01T07:51:12  <freynaud> Parabola: if you only want to check the presence of an element, you don't need a if else, you can driver.findElement();

2011-09-01T07:51:46  <Parabola> oh, so my fix would be to get rid of my if / elses  :)
2011-09-01T07:52:07  <Parabola> i've got some for flow control, but others are simply, if asdf / else print out "didnt find it" then a driver.quit

2011-09-01T08:12:35  <Parabola> wislem: so you could read the status code :)

2011-09-01T08:13:01  <wislem> what if there are no common elements?
2011-09-01T08:13:11  <Parabola> the http status code would still exist

2011-09-01T08:14:04  <wislem> not always, page title is fine for the pages that have a 404 in there, but some are untitled

2011-09-01T08:18:01  <Parabola> freynaud: if i no longer use the "isElementPresent" how would i handle my if elses? in this case if you have a session cookie the login boxes are availible, and the login button is gone on the page
2011-09-01T08:19:42  <wislem> I guess there is no way to see the http status code?

2011-09-01T08:23:19  <Dude-X> on my project's webdriver tests (written in Java) we override WebElement.click to do an isVisible check and then check if a button is clicabkle by checking if it's either enabled/or disabled (if we need to check for either); while this works in a majority of cases, we do have a few flaky tests, which i suspect has to do with our detection routines.
2011-09-01T08:23:29  <Parabola> i dont have a choice, this is going to happen, firefox doesnt do it, the webdriver seems to clear that data, but on IE, it remembers it
2011-09-01T08:23:38  <Parabola> so when the next test runs, its not the normal homepage

2011-09-01T09:36:28  <Parabola> freynaud: actually java bitched, it has to return a boolean :(
2011-09-01T09:36:30  <Parabola> so i did this
2011-09-01T09:36:45  <freynaud> what has ?
2011-09-01T09:36:55  <Parabola> http://pastebin.com/mtKqm1XP
2011-09-01T09:37:02  <Parabola> when i tried to actually use that method
2011-09-01T09:38:20  <freynaud> why assert false; ?
2011-09-01T09:38:48  <Parabola> because i dont know how assertions really work, and from what i read on oracles site that will work
2011-09-01T09:39:02  <Parabola> am i misreading that?
2011-09-01T09:39:15  <freynaud> Parabola: check the testNG assert if you use testNG
2011-09-01T09:39:23  <Parabola> the documentation on it sucks ass
2011-09-01T09:39:28  <Parabola> theres 3 lines in the documentation
2011-09-01T09:39:28  <freynaud> Parabola: you have assertEquals, Tue, notNull

2011-09-01T09:40:18  <freynaud> Parabola: it's supposed to be self explanatory. AssertEquals(A,B); will make sure A abd B are equal, and if not  the test will fail

2011-09-01T09:40:59  <freynaud> Parabola: what do you want to check ?
2011-09-01T09:41:26  <Ajay> Parabola: use AssertTrue(...)
2011-09-01T09:42:03  <Parabola> if(isElementPresent(driver, By.id("topErrorMessages"))) {
2011-09-01T09:42:16  <Parabola> if thats true, someone changed the login
2011-09-01T09:42:18  <Parabola> or removed that account
2011-09-01T09:42:43  <adamgoucher> is there anything that will only work with non-remote versions of webdriver (or, put another way, if i expose 'webdriver' in my framework, why wouldnt i just always use remote webdriver)
2011-09-01T09:42:57  <freynaud> Parabola: you don't need an assert for that then
2011-09-01T09:43:04  <Parabola> freynaud: oh?
2011-09-01T09:43:18  <Ajay> Parabola: assert is for an expectation
2011-09-01T09:43:38  <jimevans> adamgoucher: that might be different depending on the language binding. the biggest thing people complain about is screenshots.
2011-09-01T09:43:46  <Parabola> hm
2011-09-01T09:43:51  <Parabola> so should i do this in reverse?
2011-09-01T09:43:59  <Parabola> and find something that would be avail. when i'm logged in?
2011-09-01T09:44:00  <jimevans> in Java (and .NET) RemoteWebDriver doesn't implement the TakesScreenshot interface
2011-09-01T09:44:04  <Parabola> then use an assertion
2011-09-01T09:44:07  <freynaud> Parabola: you have assert when your test case say : validate this and that
2011-09-01T09:44:27  <Parabola> yeah, i get that.
2011-09-01T09:44:40  <Parabola> i have no idea how to actually use it
2011-09-01T09:44:42  <Ajay> jimEvans: i think RemoteWebDriver doesn't implement  ScreenShot
2011-09-01T09:44:49  <Parabola> you're telling me the accelerator pedal makes a car go faster
2011-09-01T09:44:57  <Parabola> but i'm not aware of how to start the car
2011-09-01T09:44:59  <jimevans> Ajay: i just said that. :)
2011-09-01T09:45:03  <adamgoucher> jimevans: phew. good thing i dont use either of those languages...
2011-09-01T09:45:10  *** MenSaGeRo has quit IRC
2011-09-01T09:45:54  <Parabola> so i dont know how i would take me looking for an element and compare it to anything
2011-09-01T09:46:08  <Parabola> i'm not making sure two strings match, or ints. are the same
2011-09-01T09:46:47  <jimevans> Parabola: you want to verify the presence (or absence) of an element in your test, right?
2011-09-01T09:46:57  <Parabola> yup
2011-09-01T09:47:02  <jimevans> and you want to fail your test if that verification doesn't match the expected value.
2011-09-01T09:47:17  <Parabola> well, in this case, if it does match
2011-09-01T09:47:27  <Parabola> but i could probobly find something to do it the other way
2011-09-01T09:47:29  <Parabola> it doesn't matter
2011-09-01T09:48:07  <jimevans> then you want assertFalse(isElementPresent(...));
2011-09-01T09:48:24  <jimevans> where isElementPresent() is your function that returns false if an element is not present.
2011-09-01T09:48:34  <Parabola> ah okay
2011-09-01T09:49:03  <Parabola> this is if the element does exist , it will throw up a false?
2011-09-01T09:49:20  <freynaud> Parabola: https://gist.github.com/1186650
2011-09-01T09:49:24  <freynaud> is it what you want ?
2011-09-01T09:49:26  <jimevans> no, assertFalse is the TestNG verification routine.
2011-09-01T09:49:44  *** dmachi has quit IRC
2011-09-01T09:49:50  <jimevans> if your isElementPresent() function returns 'true' and you're asserting it should be false, that's an error, and the test will fail.

2011-09-01T09:50:25  <Parabola> i'm asking a pretty simple question :P
2011-09-01T09:50:35  <jimevans> you're not using asserts for flow control in your test case. you're using them to verify specific states.
2011-09-01T09:50:36  <Parabola> if this element DOES exist, that means it fucked up
2011-09-01T09:50:45  <Parabola> thats all i'm trying to do
2011-09-01T09:50:56  <Parabola> if its easier, let me know and i can do if it DOESNT on another element
2011-09-01T09:51:19  <jimevans> right. and you have a method that returns true if the element exists. you are asserting that the return value of that method should be false.
2011-09-01T09:51:39  <jimevans> the assertFalse method itself doesn't return anything.
2011-09-01T09:52:08  <jimevans> you confused me with your statement of "throw up a false". i don't know what that mean.s
2011-09-01T09:52:08  <Parabola> you know you've lost touch with humanity when a sentence like that makes sense to you
2011-09-01T09:52:21  * Parabola gives up
2011-09-01T09:52:32  <freynaud> Parabola: does exist = fuckep translate to assert.assertEquals( driver.findElements(By.id()).size(),0,"it's horrible");
2011-09-01T09:52:32  <jimevans> i'm pretty sure assertFalse is what you want.
2011-09-01T09:53:16  <freynaud> that will have your test failing with the message "it's horrible" is the By you provide returns anything else than 0 eleemnts

2011-09-01T10:00:07  <jimevans> the first is to wrap the setting of the <option> element's selected property in calls to focus() and blur() on the select element
2011-09-01T10:00:10  <Ajay> :ask
2011-09-01T10:00:10  <selbot2> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
2011-09-01T10:00:42  <jimevans> the second is to use document.createEvent() for firing the 'onchange' event. this fixes the IE9-in-standards-mode case.

2011-09-01T10:15:40  <WebDriverDerp> is there a better way then to check for the element being present before i try and click on it?
2011-09-01T10:16:26  <jimevans> no, that's the right approach, the exporter just writes bad^h^h^h inefficient code.
2011-09-01T10:17:13  <Parabola> yeah
2011-09-01T10:17:24  <WebDriverDerp> yeah i noticed that
2011-09-01T10:17:38  <Ajay> jimevans: should i tell about explict waits
2011-09-01T10:17:42  <Parabola> you should
2011-09-01T10:17:45  <Parabola> and save lots of code
2011-09-01T10:17:50  <WebDriverDerp> i'm wanting to start writing stuff in c# but this is really just a test to see if my setup is working

2011-09-01T10:18:24  <jimevans> if it's not finding the element, using WebDriverWait won't help the situation.
2011-09-01T10:19:05  <Ajay> Thread.sleep always scares me
2011-09-01T10:19:35  <jimevans> Ajay: yeah, but there's a difference in hard-coding a long sleep, and using a small sleep as part of an explicit wait routine.

2011-09-01T10:20:22  <jimevans> i might quibble with the size of the sleep (1 second? might be better if it were shorter), but in essence, that's what all poll-and-wait routines do.

2011-09-01T10:23:48  <jimevans> WebDriverDerp: i'm pretty sure the problem lies with your FindElement calls. they can't find the element. I can't say why that's so without looking at the actual site, though.
2011-09-01T10:24:32  <WebDriverDerp> i'm curious then why would the IDE be able to find them and not webdriver?
2011-09-01T10:24:55  <WebDriverDerp> both are referancing by id
2011-09-01T10:24:56  <jimevans> there are a number of reasons I could think of.
2011-09-01T10:25:03  <Parabola> 1.) it hates you
2011-09-01T10:25:05  <WebDriverDerp> lol
2011-09-01T10:25:06  <jimevans> are the id's dynamically generated?
2011-09-01T10:25:14  <WebDriverDerp> yeah well i know that already Parabola :D
2011-09-01T10:25:18  <Parabola> hehe
2011-09-01T10:25:23  <WebDriverDerp> nope they're static, just stupidly named
2011-09-01T10:26:09  <WebDriverDerp> i'm starting to think there's a problem with my webdriver install
2011-09-01T10:26:11  <Parabola> i've got seperate methods for driver inits. and my tests.. whats the best way to go about doing this with testNG?
2011-09-01T10:26:15  <jimevans> running a test from within IDE executes a vastly different set of code than running it through webdriver.

2011-09-01T10:27:04  <freynaud> Parabola: i use a IInvokedMethodListener2.beforeInvocation
2011-09-01T10:27:12  <Parabola> can I simply tell testNG to run the driver init method i want, then on the next line of my xml, have the test?
2011-09-01T10:27:30  <Parabola> i need the tests to run against all browsers
2011-09-01T10:28:09  <freynaud> Parabola: you should read all the doc for testNG really if you plan to use it. Pretty much all features are needed for Selenium tests

2011-09-01T10:29:03  <jimevans> WebDriverDerp: which element is it failing to find?
2011-09-01T10:29:13  <Parabola> anyway, thats the driver code right now
2011-09-01T10:29:15  <Ajay> Parabola: look for dataproviders in testng
2011-09-01T10:29:53  *** pnitin has joined #selenium
2011-09-01T10:30:19  <Parabola> doesnt sound like what i need
2011-09-01T10:30:23  <Ajay> freynaud: does  it make sense ?
2011-09-01T10:30:26  <WebDriverDerp> ah hah!
2011-09-01T10:30:27  <Parabola> i'm not passing complex objects, am i?
2011-09-01T10:30:34  <WebDriverDerp> it is those thread.sleep calls
2011-09-01T10:30:46  <Parabola> :P
2011-09-01T10:30:46  <jimevans> what do you mean?
2011-09-01T10:30:54  <Parabola> his timeout is causing it to stop
2011-09-01T10:30:57  <freynaud> Ajay: dataprovider for browsers ?
2011-09-01T10:30:57  <WebDriverDerp> i removed those and now it finds the element
2011-09-01T10:31:12  <WebDriverDerp> for some reason i think those are causing the entire thing to go all fubar
2011-09-01T10:31:29  <WebDriverDerp> put the thread to sleep and webdriver forgets what it's doing
2011-09-01T10:31:33  <WebDriverDerp> if that makes sense
2011-09-01T10:31:36  <Ajay> with various combinations of Browsers pool
2011-09-01T10:32:05  <jimevans> i'm pretty well versed in what webdriver is doing under the covers, particularly in the .net bindings, and no, that really doesn't make sense.
2011-09-01T10:32:38  <WebDriverDerp> well that's because i'm a derp
2011-09-01T10:32:44  <WebDriverDerp> i come from a long line of derps
2011-09-01T10:32:53  <Parabola> haha
2011-09-01T10:32:55  <Parabola> we are cousins
2011-09-01T10:32:59  <Parabola> i'm the inbred derp
2011-09-01T10:33:01  <jimevans> again, without seeing the actual site, it'd be tough for me to speculate.
2011-09-01T10:33:14  <WebDriverDerp> i wish i could give you access to the site
2011-09-01T10:33:20  <Parabola> so i'm not really sure how to articulate in programmer speak what I need to do
2011-09-01T10:33:26  <WebDriverDerp> but that would be very not good for my level of income
2011-09-01T10:33:27  <Parabola> I have thoes methods for driver invocation
2011-09-01T10:33:27  <jimevans> how dynamic is the site? are there elements that are created on-the-fly?
2011-09-01T10:33:40  <Parabola> and i want the tests to run through all the browsers
2011-09-01T10:34:00  <Parabola> so i can provide a loop for each to iterate enough times for the proper version, or whatever
2011-09-01T10:34:04  <Parabola> but i dont know how to apply that to my issue
2011-09-01T10:34:18  *** jeichar_ has quit IRC
2011-09-01T10:34:25  <WebDriverDerp> there's nothing created on the fly except for a report
2011-09-01T10:35:00  <WebDriverDerp> the drop down menus are all static, the elements they contain are dynamic, but the first option 'select all' is not
2011-09-01T10:35:55  *** cerberos has quit IRC
2011-09-01T10:36:32  <Parabola> if i call the driver setup method, then on the next line in the XML, the test i want to run, should that work?
2011-09-01T10:36:38  <Parabola> or is that not how this is supposed to be done
2011-09-01T10:36:44  <jimevans> well, absent being able to look at a page that reproduces the behavior you're seeing, i'm glad you got something that works

2011-09-01T11:13:28  <jimevans> is it possible the syntax error is in your application code?

2011-09-01T11:31:17  <barancev> do I understand right that it is another 1-to-2 migration tool?
2011-09-01T11:32:34  <jimevans> it's used in SeleneseBackedWebDriver. It's designed to let you use the selenium 1.x code path, but wrapped in the webdriver API.
2011-09-01T11:32:43  <jimevans> it's like WebDriverBackedSelenium, but the other way round.
2011-09-01T11:33:05  <jimevans> At present, it's the only way of getting any kind of safari driver to work.
2011-09-01T11:33:15  <barancev> yes, my guess was close to the truth :)

2011-09-01T12:33:06  * adamgoucher sees now if irc or digging through the source himself is faster … go!
2011-09-01T12:35:19  <Ajay> adamgoucher: Are you serious :)
2011-09-01T12:36:44  <adamgoucher> the answer seems to be: source
2011-09-01T12:37:33  <adamgoucher> which would i not be serious about? :)

2011-09-01T12:54:03  <RandLAT> Using Selenium IDE 1.2 in Firefox 6, and wondering if there's a wait to test for text within fields which have been repopulated after POST. VerifyTextPresent seems to have no issue locating text on the webpage unless it's the default value of a field. Any idea appreciated.
2011-09-01T12:55:42  <mltolun> adamgoucher, how would "Grid 2" work with that?
2011-09-01T12:56:42  <adamgoucher> mltolun: dont know, i dont use grid

2011-09-01T13:19:36  <RossPatterson594> RandLAT: verifyTextPresent has a specific definition of "text" that doesn't include the values of <INPUT> elements.  Try verifyAttribute against the "value" attribute instead (or other attributes, depending on the type of field).

2011-09-01T13:39:26  <RossPatterson594> RandLAT: That doesn't look right.  Did you really mean "verify the contents of the VALUE attribute on the <A> tag contained in the <INPUT ID='edit-company'> tag"?  <INPUT>s usually don't contain other tags.

2011-09-01T13:40:30  <RandLAT> RossPatterson594: you are correct, I did not mean to do that, I got that syntax from an example of a link within a div, back to the drawing board :)
2011-09-01T13:41:31  <RandLAT> RossPatterson594: Nice, simply removing that /a from the Target did the trick. Awesome. Thanks for your help
2011-09-01T13:41:39  <RossPatterson594> RandLAT: Try something more like "//input[@id='edit-company']/@value".
2011-09-01T13:41:48  * RossPatterson594 needs to type faster.
2011-09-01T13:42:20  <RandLAT> the test passes now, either with "//input[@id='edit-company']@value" and " //input[@id='edit-company']/@value"
2011-09-01T13:42:48  <RandLAT> your syntax is probably more correct though, since I'm kinda new at Selenium
2011-09-01T13:43:15  <RandLAT> (difference is extra slash before @value)
2011-09-01T13:43:22  <RossPatterson594> The "/" is optional, it is actually more correct to omit it, but I always type it by mistake.
2011-09-01T13:45:07  <XRayCulver> anybody here able to help with grid2?
