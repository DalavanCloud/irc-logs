2011-05-26T00:00:21  <binken> it's easy in Webdriver
2011-05-26T00:00:32  <binken> in the Selenium 1.0 API
2011-05-26T00:00:40  <binken> you should use getxpathcount
2011-05-26T00:00:42  <binken> first
2011-05-26T00:00:59  <binken> Then dynamic generate the xpath for each one
2011-05-26T00:03:45  <artknish> Thanks, binken. I'll try that. I'm using the Python client driver (1.0.3)
2011-05-26T00:04:51  *** freynaud_ has joined #selenium
2011-05-26T00:09:07  <artknish> So is there a way to get, say, the 3rd match of the xpath expression supplied?

2011-05-26T00:15:48  <binken> if you have table has three trs
2011-05-26T00:15:59  <binken> you can use //table/tr[3]
2011-05-26T00:16:04  <binken> you can use //table/tr[2]
2011-05-26T00:24:15  <artknish> Sorry, getting a little confused here. I want to select an anchor tag which is like this: <a onclick="func(<number>, 12, <number>)>. I'm using the xpath "//a[contains(@onclick, 'func') and contains(@onclick, '12')]. But it's also selecting <a onclick="func(<number>, 13, 12)>. So that's my problem.
2011-05-26T00:25:02  <binken> is there any parent tag for the link?
2011-05-26T00:25:07  <amitev> hi all
2011-05-26T00:25:23  <amitev> idea what is the purpose of finding one WebElement fron another (like findElement(...).findElement(...)) ?
2011-05-26T00:26:41  <artknish> Yes, all these anchors  are in a separate rows in their own <td>s.
2011-05-26T00:27:00  <binken> findelement(table).findelement(tr).findelement(td)
2011-05-26T00:27:17  <binken> so you can use the parent tag to find the link
2011-05-26T00:27:37  <binken> like //table/tr[3]/td[1]/a
2011-05-26T00:28:04  <artknish> No, because the element I want can be in any row.
2011-05-26T00:28:39  <artknish> What I need is a contains() that can take some kind of pattern matching text.
2011-05-26T00:29:14  <artknish> or some functions that can return the values of all the onclick attributes' values.
2011-05-26T00:29:54  <binken> getattribute
2011-05-26T00:30:03  <binken> function
2011-05-26T00:31:52  <artknish> But wouldn't this also return the first locator that matches it?

2011-05-26T01:40:38  <pngl> Is it possible to check that specific Ajax requests are sent using selenium?
2011-05-26T01:43:14  <freynaud_> pngl: If the request is supposed to update the page, then you can check that. If it does a server call, selenium isn't the right tool to check the server. i'm checking the result of the request in my test directly. If the request is supposed to update a DB field for instance, i check that.
2011-05-26T01:44:31  <jarib> freynaud_: wow, nice video
2011-05-26T01:44:35  <jarib> that's awesome
2011-05-26T01:44:57  <pngl> freynaud_: Thank you. Although it could check that the browser *sends* a request.
2011-05-26T01:45:02  <freynaud_> it requires  small change in the java FF driver to pass the param
2011-05-26T01:45:17  <freynaud_> but i'll have more argument to convince Simon after i have the video :p
2011-05-26T01:45:20  <jarib> what i don't get is how --display works
2011-05-26T01:45:31  <jarib> if it works with chrome but isn't part of chrome's command line flags
2011-05-26T01:45:39  <jarib> is --display interpreted by the shell?
2011-05-26T01:45:42  <freynaud_> yes
2011-05-26T01:45:52  <jarib> huh, interesting
2011-05-26T01:46:01  <freynaud_> by default linux runs the program you launch in $DISPLAY
2011-05-26T01:46:09  <jarib> that i know
2011-05-26T01:46:11  <freynaud_> which is the current one usually
2011-05-26T01:46:20  <freynaud_> but you can target the one you want with that
2011-05-26T01:46:35  <freynaud_> i have my server on 0
2011-05-26T01:46:39  <jarib> i just didn't know the shell would mess with the program's arguments like that
2011-05-26T01:46:54  <freynaud_> i didn't know either
2011-05-26T01:47:01  <freynaud_> i found it by chance ^^
2011-05-26T01:47:21  <freynaud_> actually after you told me about the tighvnc stuff
2011-05-26T01:47:25  <jarib> though
2011-05-26T01:47:27  <jarib> if i do:
2011-05-26T01:47:28  <jarib> $ ruby -e 'p ARGV' -- --display
2011-05-26T01:47:28  <jarib> ["--display"]
2011-05-26T01:47:37  <jarib> the argument isn't removed from what the program sees
2011-05-26T01:47:56  <jarib> so a bit confusing
2011-05-26T01:48:09  <jarib> also, i don't think the c++ chrome driver invokes a shell to launch chrome
2011-05-26T01:48:49  <freynaud_> i think the best will be to document what i do with firefox
2011-05-26T01:48:56  <freynaud_> and send it to the chrome guys
2011-05-26T01:49:09  <freynaud_> i'm sure they'll find  a way
2011-05-26T01:49:35  <susin>  when will Selenium 2.0 RC be available for download?
2011-05-26T01:49:49  <freynaud_> pngl: your test <-> selenium <-> you browser
2011-05-26T01:50:12  <freynaud_> the ajax request is issues from the browser to the server. Selenium doesn't see it

2011-05-26T03:07:20  <AutomatedTester> btw, Page Objects isnt a selenium thing
2011-05-26T03:07:27  <AutomatedTester> like I said, its a design pattern
2011-05-26T03:07:48  <lisak> I know. I didn't mean Page objects at all
2011-05-26T03:09:17  <lisak> I'm using webdriver, but I do some additional tests and I just have the page already (in string representation) instead of getting it from server .. and I need to create HtmlUnit  HtmlPage
2011-05-26T03:11:20  <AutomatedTester> right :)

2011-05-26T07:36:57  <eranm> AutomatedTester: turns out that libxul.so was not stripped in in Gecko SDK 1.9 as well
2011-05-26T07:37:04  <eranm> so I'm not really sure why it's 263MB in size
2011-05-26T07:37:30  <AutomatedTester> the old VP of Engineering spotted it had cruft
2011-05-26T07:37:37  <AutomatedTester> dunno what they are going to do about it
2011-05-26T07:38:06  <eranm> I'm thinking of adding a script that will download the SDK for you and unpack it
2011-05-26T07:38:25  <eranm> Easy to do in Linux, less trivial in Mac / Windows (no wget by default)
2011-05-26T07:38:42  <ato> The repo is 454M now.
2011-05-26T07:38:57  <AutomatedTester> o hai Firefox 7
2011-05-26T07:40:02  <eranm> jarib: what's the easiest way to combine a script that fetches and unpacks a dependency into the ruby-based build system? is there a wget-like ruby library that we can incorporate?
2011-05-26T07:40:54  <yg> can anybody tell me how can i switch from 1tab to another and check that with selenium? (in perl)
2011-05-26T07:41:26  <eranm> yg, I take it you're using Selenium 1, because Selenium 2 does not support multiple tabs (at  least not on Firefox)
2011-05-26T07:41:55  <yg> for the java-server?
2011-05-26T07:42:11  <AutomatedTester> for Firefox its not supported in Se1 and Se2
2011-05-26T07:42:58  <yg> in which browser it's supported?
2011-05-26T07:43:40  <AutomatedTester> *maybe* chrome
2011-05-26T07:43:52  <AutomatedTester> but you switch window and it switches tab
2011-05-26T07:44:35  <yg> how can i handle such cases?
2011-05-26T07:46:07  <yg> one more question: in selenium ide you can choose how quickly the test will execute, is it possible to choose that with an option in perl script?
2011-05-26T07:47:16  <AutomatedTester> yg: you can do setSpeed but that is not recommended
2011-05-26T07:47:27  <yg> why not?
2011-05-26T07:47:28  <AutomatedTester> your test should have decent wait methods
2011-05-26T07:47:52  <AutomatedTester> because if your site becomes slow or on a slow connection, you will need to tweak the speed
2011-05-26T07:47:56  <AutomatedTester> thats bad practise
2011-05-26T07:48:50  <yg> the only reason why i want to use it: i changed the DISPLAY to windows machines and i can't see all the tests so quickl (just for testing one time)
2011-05-26T07:49:15  <yg> for automatic tests i will switched off that
2011-05-26T07:50:44  <yg> my $sel = Test::WWW::Selenium->new( host => $host, .... and then setSpeed = ???,
2011-05-26T07:51:07  <AutomatedTester> something like that
2011-05-26T07:51:08  <yg> or $sel->setSpeed=???

2011-05-26T09:20:43  <jarib> simon wants us to bundle it in the jruby jar
2011-05-26T09:21:11  <jarib> though i have some just packaged as standalone jars as well (in third_party/jruby/*.jar)
2011-05-26T09:21:20  <jarib> the latter is a lot easier to create
2011-05-26T09:21:40  <jarib> though if you want, i could update the jruby-complete.jar to the latest jruby + add whatever you need
2011-05-26T09:22:10  <jarib> jimevans: still having some issues with flaky implicit waits on IE
2011-05-26T09:22:19  <jarib> though it doesn't seem to happen if i run the test in isolation
2011-05-26T09:22:39  <eranm> what I want is for the build system to discover you don't have the Gecko SDK on your machine, download the right one and unpack it into third_party
2011-05-26T09:22:45  <jarib> ah
2011-05-26T09:22:49  <jarib> i misunderstood
2011-05-26T09:23:04  <eranm> But I understand that for this I need to write some ruby code to do that and integrate it into our build rules
2011-05-26T09:23:19  <jarib> that should be simple
2011-05-26T09:23:33  <eranm> The question is, if there's some convenient library to fetch a URL and save it to a file.
2011-05-26T09:23:50  <jarib> you can use net/http (from ruby's stdlib)
2011-05-26T09:23:59  <jarib> i'll get you an example for a large download
2011-05-26T09:24:28  <dawagner> I have actual XP and Win7 machines kicking about, if anyone wants help reproing anything?

2011-05-26T09:25:11  <dawagner> Preferred OS version?
2011-05-26T09:25:19  <dawagner> (And any particular IE version?)
2011-05-26T09:25:24  <jarib> about 50% of the time you'll see the implicit wait test fail
2011-05-26T09:25:34  <jarib> it has happend to me on both xp and win 7
2011-05-26T09:25:40  <jarib> with IE 8 and IE 9
2011-05-26T09:26:08  <jarib> so actually, i do know it's reproducable
2011-05-26T09:26:19  <jarib> but if you want something to do, go ahead :)
2011-05-26T09:27:32  <dawagner> Well, tests are failing without IE actually spawning for me...

2011-05-26T10:00:32  <phdaemon> even tho the link works.
2011-05-26T10:01:03  <phdaemon> The link redirects me to another page (as it should) and Selenium is throwing a fit through the RC server.... anyone encountered something like this before?

2011-05-26T10:39:44  <ato> jarib: Has there been any talk recently about how to deal with vendor specific extensions to WebDriver?
2011-05-26T10:40:02  <ato> I believe you suggested an interface-style approach?
2011-05-26T10:41:41  <jarib> i don't think it's been discussed. i remember suggesting that for the watir api, not really sure what would make sense in java
2011-05-26T10:42:42  <jarib> this would be a good question for the selenium-dev list
2011-05-26T10:43:21  <ato> I think we're approaching the point where I feel like I'm just cluttering up the API.
2011-05-26T10:43:45  <ato> We've exposed preferences, cookies, version stuff, getters for paths, products, etc.
2011-05-26T10:43:48  <eranm> ato: on which extensions are you working?
2011-05-26T10:44:32  <eranm> Preferences we're trying to fit into the DesiredCapabilities approach (which is just a key,value map and is browser-specific already)
2011-05-26T10:44:36  <ato> eranm: Well, as I said, cookies, preferences, utilities (version, paths, pid, &c.)
2011-05-26T10:45:20  <eranm> What's lacking from the existing cookies API? Do you allow setting cookies on domains not visited yet?

2011-05-26T10:45:45  <ato> Ah, I suppose cookies is a part of the official API.

2011-05-26T11:31:33  <rpk> Oh, and Selenium officially got picked today at our planning meeting over Oracle OATS, so thanks for all the help in the last two days.
2011-05-26T11:31:51  <jarib> :D cool
2011-05-26T11:31:57  <RossPatterson> w00t
2011-05-26T11:32:14  <jarib> that's nice to hear, considering your hostname :)
2011-05-26T11:33:50  <rpk> https://gist.github.com/993756
2011-05-26T11:35:16  <rpk> Oh, and ignore the random characters at the bottom... firefox crashed when I tried to submit and I switched to chrome to post the gist, and apparently switching focus failed.
2011-05-26T11:37:12  <jarib> rpk: the code looks ok. didn't you say that adding a sleep didn't solve your clear() problem yesterday?
2011-05-26T11:37:23  <rpk> Yeah, adding a sleep didn't help either
2011-05-26T11:37:43  <jarib> is this on Windows?
2011-05-26T11:38:26  <rpk> Application is hosted on ubuntu inside weblogic, I've run it both locally (through firefox driver) and through the hub I had set up (both firefox and chrome).
2011-05-26T11:38:31  <rpk> Its all java though.
2011-05-26T11:38:56  <jarib> so the browser is running on linux?
2011-05-26T11:38:57  <dawagner> rpk: What's going wrong with it?
2011-05-26T11:39:02  <rpk> Unfortunately I don't have an externally accessible ip, so I can't make the app available (its just a demo app)
2011-05-26T11:39:10  <rpk> jarib: oh, sorry, the remote machine was windows
2011-05-26T11:39:16  <jarib> right
2011-05-26T11:39:34  <rpk> dawagner: Calling clear on the field isn't clearing it.  However, sendKeys works just fine
2011-05-26T11:40:10  <jarib> rpk: you may want to try turning off native events; windows is the only platform where it's enabled by default
2011-05-26T11:40:30  <rpk> Shouldn't that not affect my tests in ubuntu?
2011-05-26T11:40:49  <rpk> I will though if it'd be helpful, just point me at how to do it
2011-05-26T11:40:54  <jarib> oh, so it fails also when the browser is running on ubuntu?
2011-05-26T11:41:04  <rpk> Yeah
2011-05-26T11:41:08  <jarib> ah, ok
2011-05-26T11:41:10  <jarib> forget that then
2011-05-26T11:41:25  <dawagner> Just to check, timeRemaining is the only element you're actually trying to clear, right?
2011-05-26T11:42:04  <rpk> let me try again.  My machine (ubuntu 11.04) has the webserver running in weblogic, the app is using gwt, and I've tested locally (firefox 4.01) and remotely (through hub, server on my ubuntu machine, node is a windows XP machine in (firefox and chrome 13.x)
2011-05-26T11:42:15  <rpk> timeRemaining is the only element, yeah.
2011-05-26T11:42:52  <rpk> It definitely finds it, each set of values has a series of 1s after the original values.  XD
2011-05-26T11:43:14  *** larrys has quit IRC
2011-05-26T11:43:20  <rpk> I can remove the for loop and WebElement List if that'd be helpful
2011-05-26T11:43:31  <dawagner> bizarre. Looks exactly right...
2011-05-26T11:44:06  <rpk> Yeah, I'm guessing it has to be some problem with gwt.  Should I try writing a test against like google.com, and calling clear on that?
2011-05-26T11:44:14  <dawagner> Ooh wait
2011-05-26T11:44:25  <dawagner> What kind of element is the timeRemaining?
2011-05-26T11:44:45  <jarib> perhaps it's a super special GWT text field
2011-05-26T11:45:04  <jarib> made up of 233 <div>s
2011-05-26T11:45:07  <dawagner> I'm hoping it's an actual <input type="text" />, though it's gwt so I doubt it :P
2011-05-26T11:46:19  <rpk> Let me grab the html for you.
2011-05-26T11:46:53  <rpk> <input disabled="disabled" id="gwt-debug-remainingSpinner" class="gwt-TextBox" type="text">
2011-05-26T11:47:02  <dawagner> Woo! that'd be the reason
2011-05-26T11:47:04  <rpk> Its inside a td for some disturbing reason
2011-05-26T11:47:05  <dawagner> 		        	return d.findElement(By.id("gwt-debug-remainingSpinner")).getText().equals("");
2011-05-26T11:47:06  <rpk> too
2011-05-26T11:47:06  <dawagner> Needs to be
2011-05-26T11:47:12  <dawagner> 		        	return d.findElement(By.id("gwt-debug-remainingSpinner")).getAttribute("value").equals("");
2011-05-26T11:47:14  <dawagner> Give that a go
2011-05-26T11:47:33  <jarib> ah
2011-05-26T11:47:35  <jarib> right.
2011-05-26T11:47:59  <jarib> well. if it's a <td>, .clear() won't work
2011-05-26T11:48:08  <dawagner> This is the most common gotcha I've experienced.  And why I'd quite like to find a nice solution... Bleugh
2011-05-26T11:48:32  <rpk> Its just chilling, and I'm guessing timed out
2011-05-26T11:48:45  <jarib> rpk: you can try typing "ctrl-a, backspace" into the element
2011-05-26T11:48:51  <rpk> yeah, it timed out after waiting, I'm guessing clear never did anything
2011-05-26T11:48:53  <jarib> dawagner can show you the java syntax to do that
2011-05-26T11:48:57  <jarib> :)
2011-05-26T11:48:57  <rpk> jarib: why wouldn't clear work though?
2011-05-26T11:49:22  <rpk> dawagner: and is there a specific reason why getText doesn't ... get the text?
2011-05-26T11:49:24  *** Mephian has quit IRC
2011-05-26T11:49:47  <jarib> rpk: it gets the innerText of the element
2011-05-26T11:49:50  *** Mephian has joined #selenium
2011-05-26T11:50:10  <rpk> jarib: but wouldn't that not make sense for input elements?
2011-05-26T11:51:35  <jarib> rpk: consider <div id="a">name: <input id="b" value="foo"></div>
2011-05-26T11:51:42  <dawagner> By the way, the java for that is element.sendKeys(Keys.CONTROL, "a", Keys.BACK_SPACE);
2011-05-26T11:51:45  <rpk> Also, just curious, wouldn't it make sense to add a "setText" method that did clear + sendKeys?
2011-05-26T11:51:55  <jarib> rpk: what would you expect .getText() to return?
2011-05-26T11:52:23  <jarib> on either element?
2011-05-26T11:52:44  <rpk> jarib: if the id b was the element selected, I would expect the text that currently appears in that input
2011-05-26T11:52:50  <jarib> and if a?
2011-05-26T11:53:01  <dawagner> rpk: I tend to end up with a setText method of my own, but there are too many options for events for us to give a sensible default; either we backspace through them all, or we select and backspace (control may have special meaning?), or we clear with javascript, or...?
2011-05-26T11:53:09  <rpk> If a, I would expect the entire innerhtml
2011-05-26T11:53:27  <dawagner> By "the entire innerhtml" does that include "foo" or not?
2011-05-26T11:53:38  <jarib> so a.getText() == 'name <input id="b" value="foo">' ?
2011-05-26T11:53:59  <rpk> Yeah, I think so, whatever would be consistent with say the same jquery call
2011-05-26T11:55:35  <rpk> dawagner: I think clear with javascript would honestly be the best approach for people using a setText function.  They expect that whatever text was there is now replaced with the new text.  Similar to the java approach in swing.
2011-05-26T11:56:02  <rpk> (but I've only been using it for two days, so what do I know)
2011-05-26T11:56:15  <jarib> rpk: jquery would give you "name: "
2011-05-26T11:56:47  *** tunabum has joined #selenium
2011-05-26T11:56:53  <jarib> and then if b.getText() == "foo", it's just super inconsistent
2011-05-26T11:56:56  <rpk> jarib: I suppose I expect that then?  I think consistency with javascript functionality of the same names in jquery / prototype would be the correct implementation
2011-05-26T11:57:43  <jarib> rpk: jquery gives you an empty string if you call .text() on a text field
2011-05-26T11:58:09  *** larrys has joined #selenium
2011-05-26T11:58:35  <rpk> jarib: but don't they provide val()?  You don't expose that, or equivalent functionality
2011-05-26T11:58:39  <jarib> so for this exact example, webdriver behaves exactly like jquery ;)
2011-05-26T11:58:56  <jarib> what is .getAttribute("value") if not equivalent functionality?
2011-05-26T11:59:03  <rpk> XD lol, its been way too long since I've gotten to use Javascript
2011-05-26T11:59:08  <rpk> jarib: its a pain
2011-05-26T11:59:29  <jarib> heh
2011-05-26T11:59:51  <jarib> if you want a jquery-like API in java, then that can easily be built on top of webdriver
2011-05-26T11:59:53  <rpk> Its also unintuitive.  For such a commonly performed task, I would think you'd want to expose a method fascilitating it
2011-05-26T11:59:59  <rpk> facilitating^
2011-05-26T12:00:09  <jarib> we intentionally try to keep the API minimal
2011-05-26T12:00:27  <dawagner> jarib: We also try to keep it intuitivie ;)
2011-05-26T12:00:32  <rpk> jarib: yeah, I get that.  It just makes it a bit harder to use.
2011-05-26T12:00:44  <jarib> dawagner: i don't think it's unintuitive ;)
2011-05-26T12:00:56  <rpk> I mean, even adding a Value option, and people had to switch to use that, would be more reasonable
2011-05-26T12:01:08  <rpk> jarib: can't type check the getAttribute method either.
2011-05-26T12:01:12  <dawagner> It's come up with every person I've introduced to WebDriver, on the first day ;)
2011-05-26T12:01:43  <rpk> (I don't mean to offend anyone at all, obviously this is your project and you can do whatever you want with it :) )
2011-05-26T12:01:49  <jarib> AutomatedTester, dawagner: i've got a hanging alert
2011-05-26T12:02:01  <jarib> eranm: ^
2011-05-26T12:02:46  <dawagner> rpk: What type checking do you want? getAttribute returns a (nullable) String...
2011-05-26T12:02:47  <jarib> rpk: actually WebElement.getValue() was recently deprecated ;)
2011-05-26T12:03:03  *** jimevans has joined #selenium
2011-05-26T12:03:22  <rpk> dawagner: You can't type the parameter
2011-05-26T12:03:23  <dawagner> (And no offence at all; it's a problem we'd like to fix, we just don't have an obvious answer :))
2011-05-26T12:03:28  *** curseg1 has left #selenium
2011-05-26T12:03:30  <rpk> err, type check the parameter for it
2011-05-26T12:03:52  <rpk> where if you provided getValue(), I can be sure that I didn't type in "valeu" by mistake.
2011-05-26T12:04:03  <dawagner> Aah fair :)
2011-05-26T12:04:21  <rpk> It just seems like it would be a super common thing (interacting with input fields) that it'd be worth it to expose utility methods for it
2011-05-26T12:04:45  <rpk> even if its just aliasing getAttribute
2011-05-26T12:05:10  <jarib> i did suggest adding an Input class to the support package last time this came up
2011-05-26T12:05:22  <rpk> oh that'd be pretty sweet as well.
2011-05-26T12:05:41  <dawagner> What methods would you expect on it?
2011-05-26T12:05:45  <rpk> maybe a forms class as well
2011-05-26T12:05:56  <rpk> err, rather, a form class instead of an input class.
2011-05-26T12:05:58  <dawagner> (And how easily would it be discoverable?)
2011-05-26T12:06:06  <dawagner> This sounds a lot like watir... :P
2011-05-26T12:06:28  <rpk> dawagner: never used watir (we turned watir down, not mature enough, lacked grid 2.0)
2011-05-26T12:06:56  *** tunabum has quit IRC
2011-05-26T12:07:10  <rpk> but I think it would be easier to say, "Go look at the forms class for that kind of functionality" than explain getAttribute.  If you included it in your tutorial / examples, it'd be very obvious as well.
2011-05-26T12:09:32  <rpk> Anyways, does anyone have a guess as to why clear doesn't work?  The ctrl-a + delete combo obviously does, but I'll look like an idiot demoing that to our VP in two days after I said that Selenium was probably 1 to 2 years ahead of OATS.
2011-05-26T12:11:12  <rpk> (which it is, the lack of browser and OS support from OATS is just ridiculous, and I'd hate to find out what the ajax / wait blocking support is like in OATS)

2011-05-26T12:16:47  <dawagner> jarib: Does clear require an element not be disabled?
2011-05-26T12:17:08  <jarib> jimevans: so probably if you run `go //rb:ie-test`, you should see one of the implicit wait tests failing
2011-05-26T12:18:13  <jarib> dawagner: surprisingly, no
2011-05-26T12:18:23  <jarib> at least not with synthesized events
2011-05-26T12:18:25  <jarib> (os x)
2011-05-26T12:19:19  <jarib> rpk: i've written a watir implementation on top of webdriver, it does work with grid 2
2011-05-26T12:19:22  <jarib> https://github.com/jarib/watir-webdriver
2011-05-26T12:21:01  <jimevans> jarib: Ok. I'll give it a shot when I can.
2011-05-26T12:21:13  <eranm> barancev: that's right, I've told that to Dounia
2011-05-26T12:21:21  <rpk> jarib: oh yeah, I should have realized that both selenium and watir moving on top of webdriver meant they would both support grid.
2011-05-26T12:21:40  <jimevans> What do the ruby tests do that .NET doesn't I wonder.
2011-05-26T12:21:47  *** freynaud_ has joined #selenium
2011-05-26T12:22:02  <jarib> good question.
2011-05-26T12:22:02  <dawagner> rpk: I'm afraid without (ideally minimal) HTML and javascript to reproduce, we're unlikely to find a solution... Does https://gist.github.com/993870 work for you?
2011-05-26T12:22:25  <jimevans> The .NET implicit wait tests have been remarkably stable.
2011-05-26T12:22:37  <jarib> jimevans: this is the failing test http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/rb/spec/integration/selenium/webdriver/timeout_spec.rb#12
2011-05-26T12:22:45  <jarib> IIRC it doesn't fail in isolation though
2011-05-26T12:22:50  <rpk> dawagner: I might be able to extract just the html + javascript that went into that page.
2011-05-26T12:23:04  <eranm> jarib: is the hanging alert during selenium 1 tests?
2011-05-26T12:23:09  <jarib> eranm: correct
2011-05-26T12:23:15  <dawagner> rpk: It would definitely be handy :)
2011-05-26T12:24:10  <rpk> Hmm, perhaps I'll try clear on a gwt demo page if I can find one.  And if that works, I'll just blame the programmers who put together the demo application I'm using.
2011-05-26T12:24:31  <dawagner> :D
2011-05-26T12:25:19  <rpk> dawagner: that gist, should I be incorporating it into my test?  the before / after part?
2011-05-26T12:25:57  <dawagner> rpk: It's a standalone java app with its own page to test against
2011-05-26T12:26:17  <dawagner> (Seeing whether clear works in general for you)
2011-05-26T12:26:25  <rpk> oh ok, yeah. i'll check, just a moment.

2011-05-26T12:28:22  <phdaemon> however, if i put in the URL on the browser directly it works

2011-05-26T12:29:07  <rpk> dawagner: Before: 1 After:    ... looks like it worked.
2011-05-26T12:29:08  <phdaemon> Also, this is using RC and Grid
2011-05-26T12:30:43  <dawagner> rpk: That's reassuring, at least...Must be some weird gwt thing... (Although lots of Google teams use WebDriver to test gwt apps, so it must be a pretty strange edge case!)
2011-05-26T12:31:07  <dawagner> Definitely going to need a repro case to fix, though!
2011-05-26T12:31:13  <rpk> I'm trying to runit against their demo page, but its impossible because they don't have ids exposed
2011-05-26T12:31:36  <dawagner> Where's the demo page?
2011-05-26T12:31:38  <RossPatterson> Right, that's why I hate GWT.
2011-05-26T12:31:49  <rpk> RossPatterson: we hate GWT too.
2011-05-26T12:31:54  <dawagner> Can work out whaever xpath is needed to find the correct element, and find it that way
2011-05-26T12:32:03  <rpk> dawagner: yeah, I'm working on it
2011-05-26T12:32:05  <dawagner> (Not for a real test, but for a demo!)
2011-05-26T12:32:34  * dawagner is so glad he decided not to use GWT for his current pet project :)
2011-05-26T12:33:14  <rpk> yeah, someone actually said "and we might be able to wrap jquery objects with gwt" today, I almost threw up in my mouth
2011-05-26T12:34:38  <rpk> no way
2011-05-26T12:34:45  <rpk> it works on the gwt page, surprise surprise.
2011-05-26T12:35:25  <rpk> So, I assume someone screwed up the html / js somehow...
2011-05-26T12:35:48  <dawagner> I'm curious as to how...!
2011-05-26T12:36:04  <rpk> I'll try and get a reproducable example, though I'm not sure if I'll be able to strip out enough of the page in order to share it publically anywhere.

2011-05-26T13:02:15  <rpk> Ok, so I think I got closer to figuring it out.  Basically, someone defined only 'change' for the text input, and most likely failed to handle the null / "" case (whatever clear is effectively doing), and instead just catches and returns false

2011-05-26T13:20:06  <jimevans> Ok. I believe it.
2011-05-26T13:20:41  <freynaud_> this is still a bit annoying as I prefer xp :p
2011-05-26T13:20:45  <eranm> AutomatedTester: haven't had time to look at it, was submitting the native events
2011-05-26T13:20:55  <AutomatedTester> ok
2011-05-26T13:20:57  <freynaud_> lower memory footprint, so better for a grid
2011-05-26T13:21:03  <AutomatedTester> still cant repro this bug
2011-05-26T13:21:57  <eranm> dawagner also couldn't reproduce it
2011-05-26T13:22:09  <eranm> The XP machine I'm testing on is a VM, which is extremely slow
2011-05-26T13:22:14  <eranm> I wonder if that has anything to do wih it
2011-05-26T13:22:16  <eranm> with it
2011-05-26T13:22:53  <barancev> eranm: do you mean slowness?
2011-05-26T13:23:08  <eranm> Yes
2011-05-26T13:23:20  <eranm> AutomatedTester suggested it may have something to do with the alert being overridden
2011-05-26T13:23:39  <eranm> and that we have to periodically check it's overridden and if not, override it
2011-05-26T13:23:45  <eranm> do  I understand correctly, ?
2011-05-26T13:23:49  <jimevans> freynaud_: However, in the initial report of #1700, the it indicates reproduce on win7

2011-05-26T13:23:57  <AutomatedTester> eranm: thats it
2011-05-26T13:24:14  <eranm> AutomatedTester: Do you have a pointer to the code where we should be doing it?
2011-05-26T13:24:18  <AutomatedTester> but I dont want to change the code and break something without failing code
2011-05-26T13:24:26  <jarib> i have it failing here
2011-05-26T13:24:30  <AutomatedTester> i think its in selenium-api.js
2011-05-26T13:24:33  <jarib> it seems quite consistent
2011-05-26T13:24:44  <jarib> if you wrote a patch i'd be happy to test it out
2011-05-26T13:24:46  <AutomatedTester> jarib: your personal machine?
2011-05-26T13:24:50  <freynaud_> jimevans: 32 vs 64 maybe ?
2011-05-26T13:25:00  <jarib> AutomatedTester: in a Win7 VM on my mac

2011-05-26T13:26:13  <barancev> not VM, but real hard i7 box with 8GB RAM - and hanging alerts
2011-05-26T13:26:54  <AutomatedTester> jarib: i wouldnt expect an error in the console
2011-05-26T13:27:07  <AutomatedTester> current code thinks its worked but failed

2011-05-26T13:30:07  <eranm> AutomatedTester: if you can produce a patch, even a blind one, it will provide jarib and me a starting point.
2011-05-26T13:30:12  <rpk> Yeah, ok, I saw that on the google group a few days ago.
2011-05-26T13:30:20  <AutomatedTester> ok
2011-05-26T13:30:33  <AutomatedTester> still svn up'ing

2011-05-26T13:32:39  <jarib> eranm, AutomatedTester: i can do a git bisect to find out what commit caused it
2011-05-26T13:32:55  <AutomatedTester> jarib: the issue is the browser, not our code
2011-05-26T13:32:59  <jarib> ah
2011-05-26T13:33:05  <jarib> :(
2011-05-26T13:33:06  <eranm> Exactly, I don't think it ever worked in FF4
2011-05-26T13:33:18  <AutomatedTester> its this stupid inner/outer window thing
2011-05-26T13:34:02  <AutomatedTester> so we need to check the wrappedJSObject isnt empty, if it is, then try override alert again
2011-05-26T13:34:17  <AutomatedTester> well thats my thinking
2011-05-26T13:34:48  <jimevans> freynaud_: I do use 32bit OS, mostly for compat testing.
2011-05-26T13:34:50  <jarib> could we do the same as r11615?

We take the easy way out by ensuring that the browser always opens window rather than tab modal alerts. This isn't perfect, but since we don't allow tabs to open it's a reasonable compromise for now - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11615
2011-05-26T13:35:01  <jarib> i.e. set "prompts.tab_modal.enabled", "false"
2011-05-26T13:35:44  <AutomatedTester> no
2011-05-26T13:35:58  <AutomatedTester> or maybe...
2011-05-26T13:36:05  <AutomatedTester> might be worth a try
2011-05-26T13:36:08  <jarib> the commit does have a bunch of other stuff though

2011-05-26T13:36:48  <jimevans> freynaud_: But to be fair, I've not done extensive screenshot testing on that.
2011-05-26T13:36:49  <AutomatedTester> the other stuff in there is how Mozmill controls alerts

2011-05-26T13:45:39  <AutomatedTester> jarib: there is browserlaunchers in java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/server/
2011-05-26T13:45:46  <AutomatedTester> i think one of those has the info

2011-05-26T13:50:41  <barancev> jarib: AutomatedTester: in 2.0b3 alerts hang too, so that must be browser problem, yes
2011-05-26T13:51:02  <AutomatedTester> barancev: which API
2011-05-26T13:51:22  <barancev> AutomatedTester: 1.0, of course
2011-05-26T13:51:36  <jarib> running tests now
2011-05-26T13:51:40  <jarib> we'll see.
2011-05-26T13:52:06  <AutomatedTester> barancev: thats what we are talking about, when you put "too" it suggests more than what we are speaking about
2011-05-26T13:53:17  <AutomatedTester> pesky day job getting in the way
2011-05-26T13:54:06  <barancev> AutomatedTester: it was a confirmation that you are right, there is no need to do bisect and search a patch that introduced this problem

2011-05-26T13:59:06  <jarib> guess downloading gecko will break simon's beloved airplane build ;)
2011-05-26T13:59:46  <eranm> We do quite a lot of work on airplanes, it's not such an implausible scenario
2011-05-26T14:00:03  <eranm> but having to build once before going on the plane is a reasonable requirement, I'd say
2011-05-26T14:00:14  * jarib nods
2011-05-26T14:00:32  <jarib> what if i just want to use prebuilds?
2011-05-26T14:02:20  <eranm> I think it'll also work, because the compilation fails
2011-05-26T14:02:32  <jarib> but it will still download gecko
2011-05-26T14:03:20  <jarib> would be nice to be able to tell the build i always want to fall back
2011-05-26T14:03:27  <jarib> perhaps not in this iteration of crazyfun though :P
