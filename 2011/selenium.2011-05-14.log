2011-05-14T05:45:56  <sdimkov> I'm getting a weird error from Selenium Server on my VM. It happens randomly and I can't figure out the reason http://pastie.org/1900136.
2011-05-14T05:49:13  <sdimkov> how can I check if something uses port 4444 and fails my server? I know there is real process using it as I've stripped the system to few processes, but maybe there some lock file that's left and gives the impression that the port is locked.. ?
