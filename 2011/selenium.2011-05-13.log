2011-05-13T05:12:26  <Stuk> ato: nope, there's a difference in implementation between debugger and service where service shuts down the connection if you try and use an invalid runtime, which happens quite a lot (debugger just gives us a nice null back)

2011-05-13T06:36:06  <ivog> maybe it should be a capability which browsers can support?

2011-05-13T06:58:48  <ivog> ok, im setting up a buildmachine for selenium locally so that there's some overview of the current status of tests, for that a nunit test result file would be handy
2011-05-13T06:59:08  <ivog> i have no clue though how all that ruby stuff works
2011-05-13T07:00:03  <jimevans> the .net tests do not run completely clean. java gets around this by ignoring tests the .net suite doesn't ignore.
2011-05-13T07:00:21  <ivog> maybe i should just call nunit-console directly instead of using the ruby targets
2011-05-13T07:01:08  <jimevans> of course you're welcome to do that.
2011-05-13T07:02:09  <ivog> thats probably the easiest thing
2011-05-13T07:02:18  <jimevans> i frequently do so when i'm testing
2011-05-13T07:02:32  <jimevans> testing changes to the drivers, i mean.
2011-05-13T07:02:53  <jimevans> that's all the crazy-fun build process is doing under the covers anyway, is calling nunit-console
2011-05-13T07:02:55  <ivog> why are there no dotnet tests definitions on the build server?
2011-05-13T07:03:21  <ivog> ya
2011-05-13T07:03:53  <jimevans> which "build server"? the bamboo one?
2011-05-13T07:04:00  <ivog> yes
2011-05-13T07:04:11  <ivog> i only see java tests and website stuff there
2011-05-13T07:04:25  <ivog> i mean all languages except dotnet
2011-05-13T07:04:45  <jimevans> there are python tests there?

2011-05-13T07:05:33  <ivog> but that buildserver doesn't seem to be maintained very well

2011-05-13T08:17:05  <jimevans> it calls fail_with_message
2011-05-13T08:17:52  * jimevans doesn't fully understand the albacore architecture with respect to modules and class hierarchy
2011-05-13T08:18:19  <jarib> looks like you could monkey patch (a) NUnitTestRunner#execute or (b) Failure#fail_with_message
2011-05-13T08:19:06  <jarib> or you could add Failure#fail (overriding Kernel#fail, which is an alias for Kernel#raise)
2011-05-13T08:19:18  <jimevans> yes, i think either would work. just don't know how to do it. (ruby knowledge fail on my part)
2011-05-13T08:20:22  <jarib> after albacore is required, just do:   class NUnitTestRunner; def execute; ...your implementation...; end; end
2011-05-13T08:20:33  <jarib> it's that simple
2011-05-13T08:20:37  <jimevans> ah. i see.
2011-05-13T08:21:09  <jimevans> i'll give it a shot.
2011-05-13T08:21:13  <jimevans> thanks.

2011-05-13T08:21:47  <jarib> jimevans: ideally you'd fork https://github.com/derickbailey/Albacore and send them a pull request, to make it configurable
2011-05-13T08:22:08  <jimevans> somebody already did for the xunit test runner.
2011-05-13T08:22:08  <jarib> since we bundle albacore in the jruby jar, we could easily bundle a gem built from your fork
2011-05-13T08:22:29  <jarib> got to run, bbl
2011-05-13T08:22:36  <jimevans> thanks again

2011-05-13T10:29:44  <bobMarley> You guys need to start documenting your code.
2011-05-13T10:30:50  <jimevans> bobMarley: That's a pretty blanket statement. Can you be more specific?
2011-05-13T10:31:22  <bobMarley> jimevans: javadocs seem to be lacking afaict throughout the Selenium project
2011-05-13T10:32:06  <jimevans> if you say so.
2011-05-13T10:32:43  <jimevans> are you referring to specific classes or methods that have javadocs that are lacking?
2011-05-13T10:33:59  <bobMarley> jimevans: Specifically at the moment I'm referring to the LocatingElementHandler
