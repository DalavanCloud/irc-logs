2011-03-23T05:41:44  <AutomatedTester> have you got the ruby gem installed on EC2?

2011-03-23T06:32:33  <AutomatedTester> interesting
2011-03-23T06:36:21  <AutomatedTester> I think this is a legacy selenium bug
2011-03-23T06:36:22  *** toseter has quit IRC
2011-03-23T06:36:25  <AutomatedTester> but could be wrong
2011-03-23T06:36:35  <AutomatedTester> pass in true as a param to the open
2011-03-23T06:37:15  <lord1234> to the open of what?
2011-03-23T06:37:23  <simonstewart> selenium.open
2011-03-23T06:38:04  <simonstewart> Not having much luck with MS Virtual PC
2011-03-23T06:39:59  <lord1234> so it shoudl be $selenium.open(URL, true)?

2011-03-23T06:43:29  <AutomatedTester> hmmm
2011-03-23T06:43:33  <AutomatedTester> dunno
2011-03-23T06:43:47  <AutomatedTester> I have never done selenium that way
2011-03-23T06:43:47  <simonstewart> Do you still see the same thing if you replace 1.0.3 with 2.0b3?
2011-03-23T06:44:06  <lord1234> i can try that simon
2011-03-23T06:45:03  <simonstewart> Please. There's been a lot of changes since 1.0.3 and 2.0b3 and you might find that some of them help

2011-03-23T06:56:30  <simonstewart> It's just that if you do, selenium now supports it
2011-03-23T06:56:43  <lord1234> which is awesome
2011-03-23T06:56:47  * simonstewart should really read more than the last line of output
2011-03-23T06:57:03  <simonstewart> grief
2011-03-23T06:57:23  <simonstewart> so, installing the updates to the system integrations in IE causes it to look for "usbhub.sys"
2011-03-23T06:57:27  <simonstewart> which isn't available
2011-03-23T06:57:36  <simonstewart> because it's looking for it on a disk that doesn't exist
2011-03-23T06:57:43  * simonstewart bangs head on keyboard

2011-03-23T09:54:57  <ygerasimov> hi. Does anyone can help with integration of jquery to Selenium Server 2.0b1 ?
2011-03-23T09:55:24  <AutomatedTester> jquery - selenium integration?
2011-03-23T09:55:26  <ygerasimov> I have difficulties with repacking .jar file. After I try to run it I get error "Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute"
2011-03-23T09:55:34  <ygerasimov> I mean to add jquery to selenium server
2011-03-23T09:55:42  <AutomatedTester> why?
2011-03-23T09:55:42  <ygerasimov> so I can use jquery selectors in tests
2011-03-23T09:55:50  <AutomatedTester> its there already
2011-03-23T09:55:50  <ygerasimov> instead of xpath
2011-03-23T09:56:02  <ygerasimov> oh

2011-03-23T09:56:04  <AutomatedTester> we use sizzle, which is what jquery uses
2011-03-23T09:56:37  *** nitin_ has joined #selenium
2011-03-23T09:57:26  <ygerasimov> so if jquery is already there I can use jquery selectors without any changes like link above to stackoverflow?

2011-03-23T10:00:20  <tunabum> antlong / AutomatedTester: no luck, with it set it to 10 seconds... i can see the element on the page, before it tries to check the element, even set a break point after navigating to make sure everything was loaded before letting the code continue.   Is there a way to debug / step through the dom.js file while the test is running?
2011-03-23T10:00:35  <eranm> One of our users found a problem with the new IE driver in http://www.google.com/ig/tm/creator

2011-03-23T10:01:01  <eranm> (claiming that after clicking 'upload a page' there will be 3 frames but only the first frame is accessible)
2011-03-23T10:01:26  <eranm> but that's with an older version of the IE driver

2011-03-23T10:07:59  <EnigmaCurry> Hello, is it possible to get the HTML for a WebElement object? I see WebElement.text , but it seems to strip HTML tags.
2011-03-23T10:08:37  <EnigmaCurry> (using selenium 2 python bindings)
2011-03-23T10:08:52  <AutomatedTester> EnigmaCurry: there is get_page_source
2011-03-23T10:09:03  <AutomatedTester> but not for a specific element
2011-03-23T10:10:08  <EnigmaCurry> AutomatedTester: Ok, what does the WebElement.execute do? I tried throwing javascript at it, but it didn't like it.
2011-03-23T10:10:18  <antlong> tunabum, more likely than not, youre getting the wrong element
2011-03-23T10:10:40  <jarib> EnigmaCurry: you'll have to execute some custom JS (using executeScript)
2011-03-23T10:10:46  <jarib> i'll point you at it
2011-03-23T10:11:00  <antlong> look @ the code, it seem your web devs are applying the same class/id names to multiple elements
2011-03-23T10:11:17  <antlong> when i did find_by_class_name('button_green') it returns FREE 30-day trial, for example
2011-03-23T10:11:23  <jarib> EnigmaCurry: check the getOuterHtml function here https://github.com/jarib/watir-webdriver/blob/master/lib/watir-webdriver/browserbot.js
2011-03-23T10:11:23  <antlong> so were not even getting contact me
2011-03-23T10:11:28  <tunabum> antlong: i've made sure of that too... even printed out the dom tree (tagName#id.class  for it and every parent node) to make sure it was the right one
2011-03-23T10:11:41  <EnigmaCurry> jarib and AutomatedTester : Thanks!
2011-03-23T10:11:42  <antlong> tunabum, try it with a more explicit locator

2011-03-23T10:34:42  *** fuzzygroove has left #selenium
2011-03-23T10:34:58  <antlong> yeah because the parent node is the parent

2011-03-23T10:48:33  <antlong> using is visible on text without adding text()
2011-03-23T10:48:44  <antlong> add /text() to the end of your xpath and see what happens
2011-03-23T10:50:36  <tunabum> that doesn't return me any elements then

2011-03-23T10:59:01  <jimevans> tunabum: when you return, the problem is that the link element has a width of zero, as calculated by getBoundingClientRect(). As such, the driver assumes it's not displayed.

2011-03-23T11:11:04  <tunabum> jimevans: ahhh! i see...   is this a potential bug? Since even though the A element has 0 width, it's children do have width and thus are displayed?

2011-03-23T11:12:43  <jimevans> I suppose. I've not been following the conversation closely, but if you're using XPath locators, as a workaround, you could try appending /span to the end of your XPath.
2011-03-23T11:15:00  <jimevans> Alternatively, you could take the WebElement found by your findElement(), and call .findElement(By.tagName, "span"), in turn, on it.
2011-03-23T11:15:21  <jimevans> ^^ yeah, i know the syntax is incorrect. I'm not a Java developer.
2011-03-23T11:15:49  <tunabum> yeah, that works... still, i think i'm going to be coming across more of this when the A is display:inline
2011-03-23T11:16:19  <jimevans> well, glad we found a workaround, at least.
2011-03-23T11:16:45  <tunabum> yeah, thanks!
2011-03-23T11:16:47  <jimevans> I'm not sure how we could resolve the issue on our side; we're only using what the browser reports to us.
2011-03-23T11:17:18  <jimevans> With regards to element size, that is. :)

2011-03-23T11:19:12  <tunabum> it's a layout / display issue though... so, i think it's flawed that if the element has width or height as 0, it doesn't really mean it's contents (children) aren't visible... well, especially in regards to links... maybe some conditional coding could be added to the isDisplayed for this case?
