2011-05-20T01:37:11  <amitev> hi all
2011-05-20T01:37:28  <amitev> how to start a selenium server in order to connect with remotewebdriver?
2011-05-20T01:38:10  <dereke> amitev: java -jar selenium.jar
2011-05-20T01:38:38  <amitev> will this also work for selenium 2?
2011-05-20T01:38:45  <dereke> yup :)
2011-05-20T01:42:18  <amitev> dereke: what is the default port the server binds to?
2011-05-20T01:42:42  <dereke> 4444
2011-05-20T01:43:29  <dereke> you can see all the options by running --help at the end
2011-05-20T01:43:44  <dereke> so you can change the port if you need to

2011-05-20T04:32:08  <AutomatedTester> incorrect: do you do from selenium import selenuum

2011-05-20T04:32:24  <incorrect> i copied the example

2011-05-20T04:32:55  <AutomatedTester> ok, so then for remote you do

2011-05-20T05:24:25  *** mbeierl has joined #selenium
2011-05-20T05:24:25  <ato> Now, the bug itself is in the YAML parser.  They have different YAML parsers for 1.8 and 1.9, also.
2011-05-20T05:24:48  <ato> rspec 2.6.0 uses a timestamp that one of the parsers has problems with.
2011-05-20T05:24:56  <ato> Thus failing any new installation of operawatir.
2011-05-20T05:40:30  <incorrect> this is fantastic, i can remotely control a windows host and save screen shots locally, which get pushed into my results wiki page
2011-05-20T05:40:48  <ato> Yep.
2011-05-20T05:41:09  <ato> You can also remotely controll devices, such as TVs, mobile phones and tablets.

2011-05-20T05:42:37  <wilhelm> We did one experiment where we ran tests on a computer in Norway, controlled from a computer in Korea. It was slow, but worked. (Damn you, speed of light!)
2011-05-20T05:42:43  <ato> You can't run the remote server itself on the iPhone.
2011-05-20T05:43:06  <incorrect> control via usb or something
2011-05-20T05:43:16  <ato> Wireless would work too.
2011-05-20T05:43:30  <incorrect> usb means i don't have to worry about running out of power ;)
2011-05-20T05:47:59  <jarib> incorrect: there's a server implementation in obj-c for the iphone driver.

2011-05-20T09:58:20  <eranm> AutomatedTester, I've figured out the issue with native events: Since there's one native window handle in Firefox 4 for every window, the toolbar and the rendered DOM live in the same window - so all element of the DOM are rendered 80 pixels below where we calculate them to be
2011-05-20T09:58:27  <eranm> (80 pixels is the height of the toolbar)
2011-05-20T09:58:44  <eranm> question is, do you know of a way to figure out the height of the toolbar so I can know which offset to add?

2011-05-20T10:54:36  <RossPatterson> Hard to believe that would actually work as you describe.  But yes, for whatever link you're after, you want to get the HREF attribute from the link.
2011-05-20T10:55:39  <quentusrex> it is a very badly built site.
2011-05-20T10:56:40  <quentusrex> The button has the following: <input id="dnn_ctr665_DynamicSearch_butCVS" class="button" type="submit" style="width: 70px;" value="CSV" name="dnn$ctr665$DynamicSearch$butCVS"/>
2011-05-20T10:56:52  <RossPatterson> Ah, that's not a link.
2011-05-20T10:57:54  <RossPatterson> It's a form-submit button, for a page that probably responds with a non-TEXT/HTML file.
2011-05-20T10:58:12  <RossPatterson> I don't see how you could get that URL via Selenium.

2011-05-20T12:25:13  <dapidministts> but i still don't get the connection between selenium and webdriver :-s
2011-05-20T12:25:27  <XCulver> selenium is old selenium
2011-05-20T12:25:30  <XCulver> webdriver is new selenium
2011-05-20T12:25:38  <XCulver> selenium 2 = webdriver
2011-05-20T12:25:43  <dapidministts> oic
2011-05-20T12:25:44  <XCulver> old selenium is in selenium 2
2011-05-20T12:25:52  <XCulver> only for backward compatability
2011-05-20T12:26:07  <XCulver> since your just starting
2011-05-20T12:26:14  <XCulver> i'd go for selenium 2/webdriver
2011-05-20T12:26:16  <dapidministts> so selenium 2 doesn't use RC much anymore?
2011-05-20T12:26:36  <XCulver> it will use it more with the release of grid 2
2011-05-20T12:26:45  <dapidministts> hmm
2011-05-20T12:26:54  <XCulver> for starting out
2011-05-20T12:27:03  <XCulver> just work on getting selenium 2 examples working
2011-05-20T12:27:06  <XCulver> with webdriver
2011-05-20T12:28:01  <dapidministts> so far my understanding is that webdriver is a library for selenium like the "uses" in delphi?
2011-05-20T12:28:03  <XCulver> from my understanding with grid 2, selenium rc will be a single instance of grid
2011-05-20T12:28:29  <XCulver> i dont know delphi so i can't say
2011-05-20T12:28:33  <dapidministts> hmm
