2011-05-08T05:56:03  <__david__> Hi, I am trying to capture a screenshot of an entire webpage with selenium-dotnet-2.0b3, InternetExplorerDriver and IE9.
2011-05-08T05:56:30  <__david__> I use getScreenshot() of the ITakesScreenshot interface implemented by InternetExplorerDriver
2011-05-08T05:56:55  <__david__> I get a screenshot of the viewport, but not of the entire page without scrollbars
2011-05-08T05:57:37  <__david__> With Firefox 4 and the same C#-Program with FirefoxDriver I get the entire page like CaptureEntirePageScreenshot of Selenium 1
2011-05-08T05:57:54  *** miker2 has quit IRC
2011-05-08T05:57:59  <__david__> Has anyone found a way to get this behaviour with IE as well?

2011-05-08T06:03:13  <Davbo> __david__: My guess is IE9 doesn't support that feature, selenium 1 used a firefox extension to grab it and I'm pretty sure Chrome supports that feature natively.
2011-05-08T06:04:19  <Davbo> __david__: Obviously capturing a viewport is much easier than the window contents as it's OS not application level.
2011-05-08T06:06:17  *** miker2 has quit IRC
2011-05-08T06:09:31  <__david__> Well, is there a chance, that I get InternetExplorer 9 working with Selenium 1, CaptureEntirePageScreenshot and maybe snapsie? Has anyone maybe already succeeded with this route to save a screenshot of an entire page without scrollbars in IE9?
2011-05-08T06:17:26  <Davbo> I wouldn't know as I'm not a Selenium dev. Perhaps getting snapsie to work with ie9 would be a good first step? Hopefully someone else could help you more than I can :)

2011-05-08T07:40:47  <DarkRift> when starting selenium 2, in webdriver role, how do you specify which version of the browser it handles ?
2011-05-08T07:41:55  <DarkRift> because it doesn't seem to be able to retrieve the version of IE and FF correctly, the version is null when I check my hub node

2011-05-08T07:59:03  <ivog> Darkrift: u can specify the browsers the rc will support by using -browser argument
2011-05-08T07:59:24  <ivog> i think u can also specify the version using that argument

2011-05-08T08:08:31  <DarkRift> sweet, I'll try that, thanks, but what I find weird is that it seems to be able to find the chrome version (10.0) but not FF and IE
2011-05-08T08:08:34  <DarkRift> is that a bug ?
2011-05-08T08:16:42  <tyrion-mx> why do you have a .gitignore in your sources, do you have a git repo somewhere?
