2011-07-03T02:00:43  <uwjesd> Hello.
2011-07-03T02:01:06  <uwjesd> I want to show selenium at a presentation. How can I make it hide the password?
2011-07-03T02:01:27  <freynaud> post it on your screen ? :)
2011-07-03T02:02:15  <freynaud> you can always read it from a property file somewhere and don't open it
2011-07-03T02:02:31  <freynaud> so your code will look like sendKeys( helper.getPass() );
2011-07-03T02:02:47  <uwjesd> Indeed that would be nice.
2011-07-03T02:02:59  <uwjesd> Or could I just switch off the log altogether?
2011-07-03T02:04:03  <freynaud> you can redirect them to a file if you want
2011-07-03T02:04:43  <uwjesd> Instead of displaying? That would be nice.
2011-07-03T02:05:53  <barancev|2> se1.0? there are no chances to hide password in a log window, hide the windows itself :)
2011-07-03T02:06:33  <uwjesd> server 2.0
2011-07-03T02:08:21  <barancev|2> where do you see the password? in a password input field it is displayed as stars or dots
2011-07-03T02:09:08  <barancev|2> in a program you can hide it as freynaud adviced
2011-07-03T02:11:22  <uwjesd> Using a tiled WM anyway so as long as I use the the server without the singleWindow option nobody is going to see the pw anyhow.
2011-07-03T02:11:29  <uwjesd> Thank you guys.

The selenium IDE works fine and finds the element, but when I run the same through Java based tests, it throws an exception element not found. Here is the part of the DOM - http://pastebin.com/qJuE82th. What am i missing?

2011-07-03T22:08:14  <evlew> I'm not sure if click accepts the id of an element. The way I believe you are suppose to do it is:
2011-07-03T22:08:39  <evlew> WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver;
2011-07-03T22:08:59  <evlew> driver.get("http://myurl.com");
2011-07-03T22:09:26  <evlew> driver.findElement(By.id("ygtvlabelel2")).click();
2011-07-03T22:10:04  <evlew> hope that helps Mayank1!
2011-07-03T22:12:06  <Mayank1> evlew: As far as I know it does (it does in Selenium IDE too). Thanks, I will try it with WebDriver.

2011-07-03T22:17:45  <evlew> Mayank1: Oh, I just thought of another possible problem: if something like javascript populates the dom sometimes selenium runs so fast it will try to click on something that javascript hasn't created yet. However, this is only a problem if javascript dynamicaly loads something.
2011-07-03T22:18:53  <Mayank1> evlew: It is there in the DOM way before Selenium does it thing, so I dont' think it should be a problem.
2011-07-03T22:19:41  <evlew> Mayank1: yeah, then that's not your problem
2011-07-03T22:20:14  <Mayank1> Just doing it with webdriver, lets see.
2011-07-03T22:22:18  <evlew> Oh, just noticed something, it should be WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); (don't forget the open and close parentheses)
2011-07-03T22:22:38  <evlew> you probably caught that though ;)
