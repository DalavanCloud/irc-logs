2011-05-04T01:52:32  <barancev|2> new DefaultSelenium("localhost", 4444, "*opera", "http://localhost/") - when I do this opera starts and tries to connect to
2011-05-04T01:52:36  <barancev|2> http://localhost/selenium-server/core/RemoteRunner.html?sessionId=6193ec9ff0b94cbca9d3ba1bddc575b4&multiWindow=true&baseUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2F&debugMode=false
2011-05-04T01:52:50  <barancev|2> and stops with 404 Not Found
2011-05-04T01:53:46  <barancev|2> it seems that there is an error in launcher - it should connect to http://localhost:4444/selenium-server/core/RemoteRunner.html
2011-05-04T01:54:01  <barancev|2> or do I misunderstand something?
2011-05-04T01:56:14  <Stuk> just trying it out

2011-05-04T02:06:38  <Stuk> barancev|2: it seems I can get it to load properly if I change localhost to something else, e.g. http://www.google.com/
2011-05-04T02:08:04  <barancev|2> Stuk: hmm... you are right. ok, i'll try to make an alias for localhost

2011-05-04T04:54:01  <benignbala> Hi, I am trying a few UI automations with selenium. I am on Debian and am using Iceweasel. Using selenium, I need to do something like this.
2011-05-04T04:54:38  <benignbala> In a page in the website that I am testing, I will upload a few files. That will take about 2 mins. After that the status message needs to be verified to be some specific text.
2011-05-04T04:55:08  <benignbala> Is using pause the only way the wait for that 2 mins or is there a different way ?

2011-05-04T19:48:04  <DarkRift> is something wrong with the chrome web driver ? I have a simple user/password form, the test is able to fill the user part normally, but fails to sendkeys to the password field. When I swap the 2 lines, trying to fille password before the username, now the username is inserted into the password field ... any thoughts ?
2011-05-04T19:48:17  <DarkRift> fill *
2011-05-04T19:55:44  <DarkRift> the test is as simple as that http://pastebin.com/vRJYHem7
2011-05-04T19:56:00  <DarkRift> the password field doesn't get filled
2011-05-04T20:01:58  <DarkRift> the version of ChromeDriver I'm using is the RC build from a few days ago
