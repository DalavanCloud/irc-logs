2011-08-05T01:16:14  <Jaggu> hi simon
2011-08-05T01:16:57  <Jaggu> wanted to check with you what is the best approach to handle ajax elements
2011-08-05T01:17:14  <simonstewart> "it depends"
2011-08-05T01:17:18  <simonstewart> What are you trying to do?
2011-08-05T01:17:19  <Jaggu> One of the workaround we thought was to use FluentWait helper class. This seems to be working fine for us.
2011-08-05T01:17:29  <simonstewart> That's one of the best ways
2011-08-05T01:17:32  <Jaggu> code snippet below
2011-08-05T01:17:37  <simonstewart> Makes it clear that you're waiting for something
2011-08-05T01:17:40  <simonstewart> :gist
2011-08-05T01:17:40  <selbot2> Please paste >3 lines of text to http://gist.github.com
2011-08-05T01:17:44  <simonstewart> that's the best way to share code
2011-08-05T01:19:48  <Binken_> (H) Simon
2011-08-05T01:20:01  <Binken_> I can not click one Element in IE6
2011-08-05T01:20:47  <Jaggu> https://gist.github.com/1127126
2011-08-05T01:20:55  <Jaggu> this is the code we used to handle ajax
2011-08-05T01:21:26  <Jaggu> Would like to know if there is any best practice arnd when to use which api's for ajax elements
2011-08-05T01:21:27  <simonstewart> There's a few tweaks you could make
2011-08-05T01:21:45  <simonstewart> Hang on. I'll hack something together
2011-08-05T01:21:48  *** easonhan has joined #selenium
2011-08-05T01:22:02  <Jaggu> ok sure
2011-08-05T01:22:17  <easonhan> hi all , is that possible to set a profile when using chrome driver?
2011-08-05T01:24:21  <simonstewart> jaggu: this is a better condition to wait for: https://gist.github.com/1127136
2011-08-05T01:25:08  <simonstewart> Now updated with an example
2011-08-05T01:25:21  *** csanchez has quit IRC
2011-08-05T01:25:35  <simonstewart> Because the condition returns the thing we're looking up we save a extra lookup later in the test

2011-08-05T01:27:43  <easonhan>  hi all , is that possible to set a profile when using chrome driver?
2011-08-05T01:27:53  <simonstewart> There's ruby work that's been done
2011-08-05T01:28:31  <simonstewart> And you can pass flags
2011-08-05T01:28:40  <simonstewart> So you can set the base user directory

2011-08-05T01:30:18  <jarib> easonhan: what do you want to achieve?
2011-08-05T01:30:51  <easonhan> the cookies
2011-08-05T01:31:03  <easonhan> jarib: the cookies
2011-08-05T01:31:47  <jarib> use driver.manage.add_cookie
2011-08-05T01:32:26  <Jaggu> kewl i will try with this code , thanks simon!
2011-08-05T01:32:44  <simonstewart> np
2011-08-05T01:33:39  <easonhan> driver.manage.add_cookie does not work because before I add the cookie,the domain will be redirected
2011-08-05T01:36:26  <AJay__> hi
2011-08-05T01:37:13  <jarib> easonhan: why can't you navigate to the domain you want to add cookies to?
2011-08-05T01:38:20  <AJay__> who is handling the python bindings on pypi ?

2011-08-05T01:39:34  <AJay__> http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium/2.3.0 needs to be updated

2011-08-05T01:41:15  <easonhan> jarib:because when i navigate the domain i want to add the cookies derictly, it will automaticly redericted to the login page, the domain of login page is not what i want to add cookies
2011-08-05T01:42:14  <AutomatedTester> *sigh*... problem++ thanks to version numbers
2011-08-05T01:43:14  <simonstewart> We can just flip to having a single version number....
2011-08-05T01:43:17  <simonstewart> v3
2011-08-05T01:43:19  <simonstewart> v4
2011-08-05T01:43:53  <AutomatedTester> +1 for no version numbers
2011-08-05T01:44:02  <AutomatedTester> dont mind me... still uber grumpy
2011-08-05T01:44:07  <AJay__> +1
2011-08-05T01:44:09  <AutomatedTester> AJay__: its fixed
2011-08-05T01:44:30  <AJay__> AutomatedTester: That was fast , i was thinking of creating an issue  :)
2011-08-05T01:44:45  <AutomatedTester> meh, its just logging into pypi and correcting
2011-08-05T01:47:18  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: are we doing 2.4?
2011-08-05T01:48:07  <simonstewart> On Monday? I think so
2011-08-05T01:48:14  <simonstewart> Provided we manage to get the IE driver building again
2011-08-05T01:48:21  <simonstewart> Any reason not to?
2011-08-05T01:48:27  <AutomatedTester> not that I know of
2011-08-05T01:48:33  <simonstewart> Groovy shoes
2011-08-05T01:48:54  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: dunno if you saw but there is a new version of httpd.js that has keep-alive
2011-08-05T01:49:06  <simonstewart> Probably a bad idea to be listening to irish jigs and tapping on the desk in the office
2011-08-05T01:49:15  <AutomatedTester> lol
2011-08-05T01:49:17  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: merge it!
2011-08-05T01:49:27  <AutomatedTester> i left it with krosenvold to merge
2011-08-05T01:49:32  <AutomatedTester> he wanted the honours
2011-08-05T01:49:53  <simonstewart> Does he realise we added one patch to the httpd.js to allow us to glob URLs
2011-08-05T01:50:06  <AutomatedTester> I believe so
2011-08-05T01:50:20  <simonstewart> Then that's good :)
2011-08-05T01:50:33  * AutomatedTester would be suprised if krosenvold fubared it :)
2011-08-05T01:50:46  <simonstewart> krosenvold appears scarily competent
2011-08-05T01:50:55  <simonstewart> I think that the push for 2.5 should be "clean up"
2011-08-05T01:51:06  <AutomatedTester> ahh that reminds me
2011-08-05T01:51:20  <simonstewart> Less than 1% of tests are failing in google with the new update
2011-08-05T01:51:23  <AutomatedTester> I have a plan for what needs fixing

2011-08-05T01:55:42  <simonstewart> ?
2011-08-05T01:56:26  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: but the star numbers seem low for "top" issues
2011-08-05T01:56:30  <AutomatedTester> or maybe its just me
2011-08-05T01:56:40  <simonstewart> 142 stars seems pretty high
2011-08-05T01:56:51  <simonstewart> Anything over 20 seems interesting
2011-08-05T01:56:52  <AutomatedTester> that one yes

2011-08-05T01:57:06  <simonstewart> Right
2011-08-05T01:57:14  <simonstewart> I don't think that everyone's aware that they can star issues
2011-08-05T01:57:23  <AutomatedTester> thats kinda my point ;)

2011-08-05T03:11:30  <AutomatedTester> but back to my earlier question, are you a big classical music fan?
2011-08-05T03:11:37  <krosenvold> we still support ff3, right ?
2011-08-05T03:12:01  <simonstewart> right
2011-08-05T03:12:06  <krosenvold> How much longer ?
2011-08-05T03:12:18  <simonstewart> Until we don't need to
2011-08-05T03:12:27  <simonstewart> A while yet
2011-08-05T03:12:30  <simonstewart> How come?
2011-08-05T03:12:35  <krosenvold> The thing is, I'm trying out the pathc for keep-alives for httpd.js
2011-08-05T03:12:44  <simonstewart> And?
2011-08-05T03:12:49  <krosenvold> It's based on the version included in ff4.0 and uses ff4 features
2011-08-05T03:12:59  <krosenvold> Actually; httpd.js was updated wrt ff4
2011-08-05T03:13:10  <simonstewart> 3.6 will be supported for at least a year
2011-08-05T03:13:13  <krosenvold> So I ended up retrofitting it to the old version
2011-08-05T03:13:13  <AutomatedTester> krosenvold: Mozilla still support 3.6
2011-08-05T03:13:29  <simonstewart> We can, however, do switching of componnets in the chrome.manifest
2011-08-05T03:13:31  <selbot2> eran.mes@gmail.com half a minute ago - EranMes, on behalf of AndreasHaas: Allow specifying method or class name to the test suite builder through the command line. No need to edit the SingleTestSuite anymore. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=13246
2011-08-05T03:13:36  <krosenvold> Which just increased the diff significantly
2011-08-05T03:14:22  <krosenvold> Oh well, the patch seems to work,I'll just add some explanations to httpd.js
2011-08-05T03:15:25  <Stuk> mvn is doing /something/, I'm not sure what...
2011-08-05T03:15:43  <simonstewart> krosenvold: sgtm
2011-08-05T03:15:51  <simonstewart> also, should I learn how to do a maven deploy?
2011-08-05T03:16:34  <krosenvold> Probably a good idea

2011-08-05T03:16:51  <Stuk> oooo, it did that
2011-08-05T03:17:35  <krosenvold> Actually; if you did the deployment at least once, I'm sure you would add some of the "manual" operations in our release procedure to the main procedure instead, so it would be part of the tagged release
2011-08-05T03:17:55  <Stuk> simonstewart: I don't think it's too bad, but I feel there's too much magic going on
2011-08-05T03:17:57  <krosenvold> It's like the pom.xml files in the tag in svn don't contain the correct version number
2011-08-05T03:18:17  <simonstewart> So, sounds like a good idea then
2011-08-05T03:18:24  <simonstewart> krosenvold: will you be about on Monday?

2011-08-05T04:34:56  <krosenvold> simonstewart: Now all you have to understand about nexus: You upload, then close the repo. That gives you a url that you can download from to test. When you finish testing you release it
2011-08-05T04:36:31  <Stuk> krosenvold: my pom.xml is not in the root, but maven/pom.xml, when I do release:perform it checks out the version I want to release, but says it can't find the pom.xml, do you have any ideas how to tell it where the pom file in the repo is
2011-08-05T04:37:03  <krosenvold> What are you trying to release ?
2011-08-05T04:37:07  <Stuk> OperaDriver :)
2011-08-05T04:38:00  <krosenvold> You might want to have a look at the selenium release process, it does much the same
2011-08-05T04:38:19  <Stuk> I had a look in the Selenium poms and couldn't see anything special
2011-08-05T04:38:29  <Stuk> or different
2011-08-05T04:39:23  <krosenvold> You ca't run release:perform, but have to use something like the steps on http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ReleasingSelenium
2011-08-05T04:39:51  <krosenvold> There's nothing special about the poms, but release:perform is the maven release plugin, which will not work on anything but a proper maven project
2011-08-05T04:40:01  <Stuk> ahhhhh
2011-08-05T04:40:04  <krosenvold> (And even then it's hard ;)
2011-08-05T04:41:26  <krosenvold> Actually the release-plugin is amazing once you get it running, but it may take a few hours to get there
2011-08-05T04:41:27  <jarib> krosenvold: did you commit the keep-alive stuff?
2011-08-05T04:41:33  <krosenvold> Not yet
2011-08-05T04:41:49  <krosenvold> I'm testing it, I will try to get it into 2.4
2011-08-05T04:42:09  <Stuk> krosenvold: thanks, I'm now running deploy directly in the checkout myself, it's thinking, but looks like it's going to work...
2011-08-05T04:42:26  <adamgoucher> krosenvold: did you just say 'its easy once you do all the hard stuff' ? :)
2011-08-05T04:42:37  <Stuk> adamgoucher: I think he did :)
2011-08-05T04:43:27  <krosenvold> adamgoucher: It's not really hard, it's just *very strict about a number of things, and if you've been relaxed you'll have to sit up straight and answer up ;)
2011-08-05T04:44:03  *** italiano has joined #selenium
2011-08-05T04:44:33  <krosenvold> So it's not "hard", it's "pendantic" . Like a strict aunt
2011-08-05T04:45:00  <Stuk> krosenvold: I don't think the strictness is the main problem, it's the lack of documentation telling you what the rules are :)
2011-08-05T04:45:13  *** miker2 has joined #selenium
2011-08-05T04:45:17  <krosenvold> Or maybe too much documentation ;)
2011-08-05T04:45:18  <Stuk> and what to do when you break them :D
2011-08-05T04:45:36  <Stuk> haha, that too, when a lot of it is out of date
2011-08-05T04:46:39  <krosenvold> Acutally if you use the ASF docs they're quite good. But there is something about a middle ground between CFB (no docs) and maven (a mountain of docs)
2011-08-05T04:46:58  <krosenvold> Both are "smells" in their own way
2011-08-05T04:47:59  <Stuk> okay, now that I've done release:perform (or my messed up version of it) what do I need to do?
2011-08-05T04:48:15  <Stuk> the docs here just stop https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Stage+a+Release !
2011-08-05T04:48:43  <krosenvold> Read the selenium deploument guide at http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ReleasingSelenium
2011-08-05T04:49:00  <krosenvold> You go to oss.sonatype.org and close the repo. Then you can test it
2011-08-05T04:49:12  <Stuk> ah yes, sorry
2011-08-05T04:49:26  <krosenvold> np
2011-08-05T04:49:38  <krosenvold> I'll just keep throwing documentation links at you ;)

2011-08-05T05:43:48  <krosenvold> It's all part of my evil plan to make you deploy all the selenium binaries to a nexus repo we host outselves
2011-08-05T05:43:57  <simonstewart> That's my worry
2011-08-05T05:46:04  <krosenvold> Actually I wouldn't be surprised if we could make some agreement with sonatype to use theirs
2011-08-05T05:46:32  * krosenvold just needs to brainwash simonstewart first

2011-08-05T06:58:32  <adamgoucher> and it appears that selenese is xhtml, which means a[onClick] != a[onclick]
2011-08-05T06:58:42  <XRayCulver> i just entered it and want to make sure nothing is missing
2011-08-05T06:58:59  <RossPatterson> dawagner: VS folks shouldn't EVER have to live without ReSharper :-)
2011-08-05T06:59:04  <adamgoucher> which further implies that if we make it html5 rather than xhtml it does
2011-08-05T07:00:04  <RossPatterson> adamgoucher: Whoa there, big fella!  Does the "onClick" in "a[onClick]" come from an HTML or XHTML document?
2011-08-05T07:00:52  <RossPatterson> (Talking about xxxML in xxxML makes my head explode.)
2011-08-05T07:01:29  <adamgoucher> it comes from #2146 :)
2011-08-05T07:01:30  <selbot2>  open/new CSS locator for attribute "onclick" works only case-sensitive - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2146 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Component-IDE]

2011-08-05T07:01:55  <dawagner> XRayCulver: That's awesome, thanks :)
2011-08-05T07:03:09  <RossPatterson> Assuming the AUT is HTML, not XHTML, I'd expect Selenese to act case-insensitively.
2011-08-05T07:03:15  <XRayCulver> dawagner: cool thanks!

2011-08-05T08:15:19  *** algard has quit IRC
2011-08-05T08:15:19  <XRayCulver> you will have to tell it every page
2011-08-05T08:15:30  <ultrabutter> sitemap.xml ?
2011-08-05T08:16:17  <XRayCulver> maybe, if you can create addresses out of it
2011-08-05T08:16:24  <XRayCulver> urls that is
2011-08-05T08:16:37  <ultrabutter> what command will i need to use? i only found textPresent or something like that but it only looks for VISIBLE text, and i'm talking about invisible script
2011-08-05T08:16:37  <XRayCulver> i'm not familiar with the file
2011-08-05T08:16:44  *** cgoldberg has joined #selenium
2011-08-05T08:16:49  <XRayCulver> you can use driver.getsource
2011-08-05T08:16:50  <XRayCulver> i think
2011-08-05T08:16:53  <XRayCulver> let me look
2011-08-05T08:17:32  <XRayCulver> IWebDriver.PageSource
2011-08-05T08:17:34  <ultrabutter> every website has sitemap.xml it's just a list of all URLs that website has
2011-08-05T08:17:48  <XRayCulver> then you can parse that
2011-08-05T08:17:57  <XRayCulver> and create a url for every page you want to check
2011-08-05T08:18:02  <XRayCulver> and get the page source
2011-08-05T08:18:05  <XRayCulver> and look for text present
2011-08-05T08:18:25  <ultrabutter> okay, IWebDriver.PageSource sounds good i'll try that. and i'd have to do it to each page separately? like manually?
2011-08-05T08:18:30  <adamgoucher> could also get the w3c spider source and add a check for your magic bits

2011-08-05T08:24:28  <adamgoucher> which is why i implied you modify it to also regex the returned page content for the bit you want to check

2011-08-05T09:35:22  *** Mayank has quit IRC
2011-08-05T09:35:25  <RossPatterson> For Selenium RC or IDE, you'll need to prefix them with "xpath=".
2011-08-05T09:35:41  <lord1234> ....i use selenium RC
2011-08-05T09:35:44  <lord1234> and have never done that
2011-08-05T09:36:15  <lord1234> $browser.get_text("(//td[@class=className])[#{nRow.to_s}]")   where nRow is a counter (ruby)
2011-08-05T09:36:16  <RossPatterson> That's because RC and IDE assume "xpath=" if the locator starts with "//".  But not when it starts with "(".
2011-08-05T09:36:22  <lord1234> aaah ok
2011-08-05T09:36:34  <adamgoucher> rc/ise will assume you mean xpath if it starts with //
2011-08-05T09:36:48  <lord1234> does the "xpath=" have to be inside the quotes?  or outside of them?

2011-08-05T10:21:28  <cgp_> is there anyway to include in custom selenium command (in the selenium ide), "rollups" of multiple commands
2011-08-05T10:21:46  <cgp_> I'm struggling to understand the "rollup" concept in general in case you couldn't tell

2011-08-05T10:29:10  <XRayCulver> i want to get the inner span of each span
2011-08-05T10:31:19  <XRayCulver> FindElements(By.Class("")) would that work?

2011-08-05T10:34:35  <adamgoucher> cgp_: if you find yourself wanting to use rollups then you are out of scope of ide
2011-08-05T10:35:09  <Ajay> lukeis: does CSSSelector work correctly in ie ?
2011-08-05T10:35:12  <XRayCulver> i'm doing this off of the validation-message-list element already
2011-08-05T10:35:16  <XRayCulver> yes
2011-08-05T10:35:20  <XRayCulver> Ajay: yes
2011-08-05T10:35:38  <cgp_> adamgoucher: I was hoping to simplify the test writing process, but perhaps you're right
2011-08-05T10:35:38  <lukeis> then just "span span"
2011-08-05T10:35:51  <XRayCulver> so validationelement.FindElements(By.CssSelector("span span")) awesome

2011-08-05T10:39:58  <lukeis> yeah... changed the alias... didn't feel like using that handle here since most dev's use a version of their real name
2011-08-05T10:40:18  <cgp_> adamgoucher: you do get the impression that the roll-up portion of selenium is tolerated, not encouraged :)
2011-08-05T10:41:24  <adamgoucher> i want to remove roll-up and ui-map out of it entirely
2011-08-05T10:41:56  <adamgoucher> and my 'want' i mean 'i have the commit bit and dislike it enough to do it'
2011-08-05T10:42:07  <cgp_> If I could get more people on board with writing code, I'd be happy to kill it
2011-08-05T10:42:12  <cgp_> (well, kill this idea)
2011-08-05T10:42:35  <adamgoucher> automation == code. if they dont want to write code, then they shouldnt be using automation

2011-08-05T10:43:10  <Ajay> lukeis: Do you have few mins of spare time , we could clean up some 404 on seleniumhq
2011-08-05T10:43:25  <cgp_> so people don't have to describe it, they just hand the test over
2011-08-05T10:43:35  <lukeis> Ajay: not really, can you log them in an issue for me?
2011-08-05T10:43:53  <cgp_> and actually, probably keeping extra stuff out of it is better
2011-08-05T10:43:54  <Ajay> lukeis:yeah sure , with patches of course :)
2011-08-05T10:43:56  <cgp_> keep it simple

2011-08-05T10:46:36  <adamgoucher> cgp_: it sounds like you want something like robot framework or cucumber not se-ide

2011-08-05T10:52:25  <cgp_> adamgoucher: why is that? how are those frameworks different from just writing selenium tests, I'm not seeing the distinction (slightly annoyed at myself for that)
2011-08-05T10:52:54  <cgp_> adamgoucher: see, I'm talking about a QA person, coming through, seeing a bug, and handing it off to us
2011-08-05T10:53:09  <adamgoucher> ah. thats different
2011-08-05T10:53:10  <cgp_> adamgoucher: these aren't coders, so, the record button is, well, nice
2011-08-05T10:53:21  <adamgoucher> and /exactly/ what you should use it for.
2011-08-05T10:53:29  <adamgoucher> but no more
2011-08-05T10:53:36  <Ajay> lukeis: Does sauce labs have Sauce IDE now ? i dont think so they have sauce builder now ?
2011-08-05T10:53:46  <cgp_> yeah, and I was hoping to add in some basic commands, like "login(somename)"
2011-08-05T10:53:54  <cgp_> so, that part is kept to a minimum, and it's consistent
2011-08-05T10:54:08  <cgp_> but, it's possible that this is actually counterproductive
2011-08-05T10:54:10  <lukeis> Ajay: I don't know really anything about sauce labs... i don't use them
2011-08-05T10:54:30  <cgp_> as it wouldn't be "real" in comparison to what the user is actually doing, if that makes sense
2011-08-05T10:55:07  <Ajay> lukeis: me neither was just checking the download page of seleniumhq
2011-08-05T10:55:34  <adamgoucher> cgp_ you could write a plugin that adds that stuff into the api (which is the officially blessed way of doing that sort of thing)
2011-08-05T10:58:41  <lukeis> Ajay: looks like builder and IDE are the same thing... probably was called IDE and changed to builder to avoid confusion with Se IDE
2011-08-05T10:58:49  <adamgoucher> builder != ide
2011-08-05T10:58:58  <adamgoucher> builder is html/js, ide is xul
2011-08-05T10:58:59  <lukeis> care to clarify then? :)
2011-08-05T10:59:20  <lukeis> do they have a separate private download for IDE then?
2011-08-05T10:59:30  <lukeis> should we remove the link on the downloads page?
2011-08-05T10:59:30  <Ajay> Sauce ide was similar to Selenium IDE
2011-08-05T10:59:32  <adamgoucher> i think ide is eol'd

2011-08-05T11:18:38  <Ajay> is it refererring to version 1 of those plugins or the Released date of the latest version of the plugin ?

2011-08-05T13:28:08  <jarib> one of the examples there show how to start htmlunit with :javascript_enabled
2011-08-05T13:28:13  <zhando> thanks I appreciate it.
2011-08-05T13:28:35  <jarib> besides that, there are no headless alternatives for selenium-webdriver
2011-08-05T13:28:56  <jarib> you may want to look at capybara-webkit
2011-08-05T13:29:11  <zhando> ahh. did not think of that.. thanks..
2011-08-05T13:29:12  <jarib> but to be honest, none of the headless alternatives appear mature enough that i'd consider them
2011-08-05T13:29:32  <jarib> real browser == more realism
2011-08-05T13:29:43  <jarib> and less fighting the tool.
2011-08-05T13:29:49  <jarib> just my 2 cents
2011-08-05T13:30:07  <zhando> excellent point taken.. thanks again..

2011-08-05T13:43:05  <[1]John> Can I get some support for Selenium IDE?
2011-08-05T13:43:52  <[1]John> Anyone alive out there?
2011-08-05T13:44:35  <[1]John> There are 78 other users on and not one is active?
2011-08-05T13:45:04  <lukeis> santiycr: sent my email to dev list before noticing you logged in here, you know anything about that?
2011-08-05T13:45:26  <santiycr> lukeis: let me see the email
2011-08-05T13:45:31  <lukeis> hi, people are around... somewhat... mostly not looking at the chat screen the whole time
2011-08-05T13:45:58  <lukeis> santiycr: about sauce
2011-08-05T13:46:16  <[1]John> Ah makes sense.
2011-08-05T13:46:20  <[1]John> Thanks for responding.
2011-08-05T13:46:32  <[1]John> Can you help me with a question?
2011-08-05T13:46:46  <lukeis> with IDE... probably not... i don't use it at all
2011-08-05T13:46:51  <santiycr> [1]John: shoot out, probably someone will
2011-08-05T13:46:54  <[1]John> Well I'll ask anyways ;p
2011-08-05T13:46:58  <santiycr> hah
2011-08-05T13:47:04  <lukeis> :ask
2011-08-05T13:47:04  <selbot2> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
2011-08-05T13:47:06  <lukeis> ;)
2011-08-05T13:47:23  <lukeis> love that from jari
2011-08-05T13:47:36  <[1]John> Everytime I run a script and it hits an error the whole script hults. Is there a global skip error command or something?
2011-08-05T13:50:09  <santiycr> nice!
2011-08-05T13:50:13  <[1]John> I don't see why someone would want the whole script to end just because of 1 error. I would like the script to continue even if an error occurs but I cannot seem to find a way to force Selenium to ignore errors and proceed wit the script until the end.

2011-08-05T13:50:58  <santiycr> [1]John: what you're trying to do is basically wrong from my point of view
2011-08-05T13:51:26  <santiycr> though, the way to do it is to use verify commands instead of asserts
2011-08-05T13:51:42  <[1]John> How is wanting to skip an error wrong?
2011-08-05T13:52:19  <santiycr> why do you want your test to ignore an error?
2011-08-05T13:52:29  <santiycr> if the main goal in the test is to detect errors?
2011-08-05T13:52:58  <lukeis> santiycr: thanks for replying
2011-08-05T13:53:12  <[1]John> Because I know it is correct but want to ignore it. Here is my code: click btnOpen
2011-08-05T13:53:19  <santiycr> lukeis: np, thanks for pointing that out
2011-08-05T13:53:25  <[1]John> The button does not ALWAYS show up on the webpage but sometimes it does.
2011-08-05T13:54:11  <[1]John> We can classify this button displays based on a time frame and when I run the script the button does not always present itself so I would like for it to be skipped.
2011-08-05T13:54:46  <santiycr> then, the right way to go is to make your script smart enough to know when the button should and shouldn't be there
2011-08-05T13:54:52  <santiycr> and fork its behavior depending on that
2011-08-05T13:55:12  <santiycr> though, for that, we're already talking about a more advanced test, not Selenium IDE for sure
2011-08-05T13:55:39  <[1]John> Exactly why being able to skip the error would be more convenient.
2011-08-05T13:56:10  <santiycr> sadly, I don't think there's a way to do it on IDE, without nonsense hackery
2011-08-05T13:56:24  <santiycr> point at which, I'd advice moving from the IDE anyways :)
2011-08-05T13:56:35  <santiycr> sorry, I'm too biased
2011-08-05T13:57:02  <[1]John> Wow. Was almost sure there would be some way of doing it. What a bummer. Well thanks for your help.
2011-08-05T13:57:15  <santiycr> you're welcome
