2011-05-19T02:17:16  <AutomatedTester> The Future of Selenium is Now!
2011-05-19T02:17:28  <AutomatedTester> its what I did at Selenium Camp
2011-05-19T02:17:32  <AutomatedTester> plus a few other things
2011-05-19T02:18:51  <AutomatedTester> I love watching people's faces when doing the mobile demo
2011-05-19T02:19:26  <AutomatedTester> or when I show that I can access input=file
2011-05-19T02:20:16  <simonstewart> The highlight of the show here was doing a multi-domain, security boundary crossing login
2011-05-19T02:22:40  <AutomatedTester> dont have a web app to show that
2011-05-19T02:22:49  <AutomatedTester> but...

2011-05-19T02:57:09  <simonstewart> py/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py:151
2011-05-19T02:57:15  <simonstewart> We don't set the session id again
2011-05-19T02:57:19  <simonstewart> d'oh!
2011-05-19T02:57:49  <ato> simonstewart: Where in the Selenium tree should the operadriver jar file go?
2011-05-19T02:57:50  <simonstewart> If I run test_py, should I be expecting all the tests to pass?
2011-05-19T02:58:00  <simonstewart> third_party/java/opera/
2011-05-19T02:58:18  <simonstewart> I can add it if you want
2011-05-19T02:58:43  <simonstewart> as we'll also need the protobufs library too, right?
2011-05-19T02:58:58  <Stuk> We're going to do another release in a bit (today)
2011-05-19T02:59:16  <ato> Sure, that would be great.  Just wait for v0.4.2 release.
2011-05-19T02:59:23  <simonstewart> Give me a ping when it happens and I'll get on the case
2011-05-19T02:59:27  <freynaud> simonstewart: any luck with those 2 issues ? do you know the reason it was refactoed ,
2011-05-19T02:59:28  <ato> Excellento!
2011-05-19T02:59:39  <simonstewart> freynaud: it's on my list
2011-05-19T02:59:52  <simonstewart> The chaps who did the refactoring are asleep right now
2011-05-19T03:00:00  <simonstewart> So I don't know quite what they were doing
2011-05-19T03:00:10  <freynaud> :p ok
2011-05-19T03:00:12  <simonstewart> Will be writing some tests around the parsing to try and sort things out
2011-05-19T03:00:29  <freynaud> for the URL, it seems to be the parsing
2011-05-19T03:00:34  <simonstewart> In other news: I've just broken an astonishing number of builds
2011-05-19T03:00:42  <freynaud> for the other issue, i'm not sure
2011-05-19T03:00:45  <simonstewart> I bet we're using regexs
2011-05-19T03:00:54  <freynaud> the strange thing is : first test passes, 2nd doesn't
2011-05-19T03:01:02  <freynaud> it seems more complex that just parsing
2011-05-19T03:01:32  <freynaud> private static final Pattern PREFERENCE_PATTERN =
2011-05-19T03:01:32  <freynaud>       Pattern.compile("user_pref\\(\"([^\"]+)\", \"?(.+?)\"?\\);");
2011-05-19T03:01:43  <freynaud> each time I solve a problem with regex
2011-05-19T03:01:49  <freynaud> I end up having 2 problems :)

2011-05-19T05:26:40  <quzi> thanks
2011-05-19T05:28:28  <simonstewart> 1. It should be out already

2011-05-19T05:30:32  <simonstewart> No worries
2011-05-19T05:30:33  <quzi> the current release is 2.0 beta 3. My question was when do you plan next one ?
2011-05-19T05:30:38  <simonstewart> It didn't come across that way :)
2011-05-19T05:30:42  <simonstewart> Sorry if my reply did

2011-05-19T05:31:17  <quzi> so that would mean very soon as it isn't out yet
2011-05-19T05:31:22  <simonstewart> We're currently getting the tests green so that we can release
2011-05-19T05:31:25  <quzi> and that would mean it would be the one having Opera ?

2011-05-19T05:31:35  <quzi> great
2011-05-19T05:31:42  <quzi> and that would be 2.0 beta 4 ?

2011-05-19T05:31:48  <simonstewart> and we'll bundle it in

2011-05-19T06:12:20  <Zladivliba> I'm having a hard time entering text and saving it back to the server (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't... grrrrrr)
2011-05-19T06:18:43  <jarib> jimevans: starting to think about it can't hurt :)

2011-05-19T06:25:21  <AutomatedTester> hi hi
2011-05-19T06:25:22  <jimevans> that's kind of how i feel about it.
2011-05-19T06:25:28  <jimevans> hi AutomatedTester
2011-05-19T06:25:58  <jimevans> i feel like we're missing a couple of API features that we should figure out how to add for vNext
2011-05-19T06:26:15  <jimevans> attaching to a running browser instance for one.
2011-05-19T06:26:43  *** RossPatterson has quit IRC
2011-05-19T06:27:00  <jimevans> yes, that's pretty tricky to implement well, but it's something that people have wanted for a long time.
2011-05-19T06:27:52  <jimevans> simonstewart had a great idea yesterday about offering different keyboard and mouse implementations
2011-05-19T06:28:56  <jimevans> (meaning different input device implementations in the drivers themselves)
2011-05-19T06:28:58  <jimevans> but we need an api for telling the native browser driver to switch to a different implementation
2011-05-19T06:29:45  <jimevans> (note that with a small change to our existing API, a user could supply his own keyboard and mouse implementations today, but written at the language-binding level)
2011-05-19T06:32:01  <jimevans> i'm sure smarter people than me are already thinking about these and other things, but those are the big pieces i see missing at the moment.

2011-05-19T07:37:45  <jimevans> i'm just having a horrible day. i spent several hours last night reorganizing the ie driver code, but before checking it in, i ran the tests (like a good boy)
2011-05-19T07:37:55  <jimevans> i had unexpected failures.
2011-05-19T07:38:23  <jarib> it happens
2011-05-19T07:38:23  <jimevans> spent 3 hours trying to track them down, with no success.
2011-05-19T07:38:35  <jarib> ah

2011-05-19T07:39:04  <simonstewart> How odd
2011-05-19T07:39:25  <jimevans> yeah, i just got to the actual machine, ran the tests from the console, and they passed.

2011-05-19T07:57:18  <jimevans> simonstewart: well, anything that is driver-specific. at present, the command names are in an enum, which makes it hard to extend
2011-05-19T07:57:37  <simonstewart> Ahhh... we broke that out in the java world

2011-05-19T08:00:58  <jimevans> the ie driver conveniently ignores that json parameter to the new session command.

2011-05-19T09:06:58  <simonstewart> I was trying to figure out what's up with the selenium-server-standalone target
2011-05-19T09:07:06  <ato> operawatir v0.4.1 is now out
2011-05-19T09:07:07  <freynaud> it's not moved
2011-05-19T09:07:13  <simonstewart> Turns it out it's defined at the top and the bottom of the Rakefile
2011-05-19T09:07:14  <freynaud> but the entry point have changed
2011-05-19T09:07:17  <simonstewart> *sigh*
2011-05-19T09:07:39  <freynaud> it goes to grid, and it -role isn"'t there, launches SeleniumServer as before

2011-05-19T09:10:58  <jimevans> i don't understand the webdriverbackedselenium atoms.
2011-05-19T09:11:11  <simonstewart> feel free to ask questions
2011-05-19T09:12:39  <jimevans> i see in the build.desc for selenium-atoms where the function is named, but i don't know how to translate that into where the function lives in the source code.
2011-05-19T09:12:54  <jimevans> core.locators.isElementPresent for example.
2011-05-19T09:13:15  <simonstewart> The key is the "module" section
2011-05-19T09:13:28  <simonstewart> It equates to a "goog.provides" statement
2011-05-19T09:13:41  <simonstewart> So "somewhere" there's a file that provides "core.locators"
2011-05-19T09:13:50  <freynaud>  cp "build/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/server/server-standalone.jar", "build/dist/selenium-server-standalone-#{version}-without-grid.jar"

2011-05-19T09:13:54  <freynaud> is what I changed
2011-05-19T09:14:14  <freynaud> the 2b3 deliverable is no without grid one
2011-05-19T09:14:31  <jimevans> simonstewart: got it, thanks for the help.
2011-05-19T09:14:33  <freynaud> and the normal one has the switch to have grid started if you pass the param
2011-05-19T09:14:36  <simonstewart> Groovy
2011-05-19T09:15:02  <simonstewart> OK
2011-05-19T09:15:23  <simonstewart> Since we want the remote server to always contain grid, I'm about to make some (minor) changes
2011-05-19T09:15:45  <freynaud> well, it's not documented in any wiki yet
2011-05-19T09:15:56  <freynaud> so whatever you do, it will always match the doc :)

2011-05-19T09:17:13  <freynaud> simonstewart: remote server containts the grid = 1 jetty for both the grid and remote, or 2 jetty instances ?
2011-05-19T09:17:28  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: he loves us too much not to visit
2011-05-19T09:17:50  <simonstewart> freynaud; was that a statement or a question?
2011-05-19T09:18:19  <freynaud> question. At the moment I always launch 2, 1 grid and 1 remote on a different port
2011-05-19T09:18:29  <simonstewart> That's right
2011-05-19T09:18:31  <jimevans> i'm trying to talk someone through a conversion from WatiN, and they seem set on instantiating WebDriverBackedSelenium to get the use of isElementPresent (the equivalent of .Exists) and isTextPresent
2011-05-19T09:18:35  <simonstewart> But it should be the same JAR
2011-05-19T09:18:48  <simonstewart> jimevans: *sigh*
2011-05-19T09:18:55  <simonstewart> That's crazy
2011-05-19T09:19:04  <jimevans> for isElementPresent, they should be catching the NoSuchElementException from FindElement.
2011-05-19T09:19:23  <simonstewart> Right

2011-05-19T09:19:47  <simonstewart> You might want to talk to them about abstractions on top of webdriver
2011-05-19T09:20:24  <jimevans> for isTextPresent, i'd probably do a driver.FindElement(By.TagName("body")).Text.Contains(foo);
2011-05-19T09:20:52  <simonstewart> Yes
2011-05-19T09:20:57  <simonstewart> I think that's basically what we do do
2011-05-19T09:20:58  <jimevans> re: abstractions: this is actually inside their abstraction...
2011-05-19T09:21:02  <simonstewart> (or used to)
2011-05-19T09:21:20  <jimevans> that's what i'm trying to find out, if deep down in the javascript, that's essentially what the selenium atoms are doing...
2011-05-19T09:21:47  <simonstewart> yes it is
2011-05-19T09:22:08  <simonstewart> Though selenium's algorithm for text is different from webdriver's
2011-05-19T09:22:18  <simonstewart> so that approach might return "true" for the IsTextPresent
2011-05-19T09:22:24  <simonstewart> But the returned text might not match
2011-05-19T09:23:17  <simonstewart> Which would be hilarious to debug
2011-05-19T09:24:43  <jimevans> yes, i agree. the point is they're trying to achieve feature-parity with what they had with WatiN.
2011-05-19T09:24:57  <jimevans> these are the two pieces they were missing.

2011-05-19T09:25:34  <simonstewart> (right, quick meeting time)
2011-05-19T09:25:35  <jimevans> WatiN has (basically) an Element.Exists() method, and a Browser.ContainsText() method.
2011-05-19T09:25:49  <simonstewart> Easily modelled
2011-05-19T09:25:55  <simonstewart> But not in the actual API
2011-05-19T09:25:59  <simonstewart> For obvious reasons
2011-05-19T09:26:20  <jimevans> and you're right, extension methods would be the easiest way to tack them onto an IWebDriver instance in one's framework.
2011-05-19T09:26:27  <jimevans> (in C#, that is)
2011-05-19T09:27:11  * jimevans really has to find time to create that WatiN-WebDriver project...
2011-05-19T09:28:17  <jimevans> i'm so disgusted with myself. i've actually started answering questions on the sqa stackexchange site. i feel so... dirty.
2011-05-19T09:28:32  <Ivog> Why?
2011-05-19T09:28:53  <Ivog> :)
2011-05-19T09:29:44  <jimevans> because i'm still carrying a grudge about the way the Selenium StackExchange proposal was handled.

2011-05-19T09:32:03  <Ivog> That site is probably right for selenium users
2011-05-19T09:32:04  <jimevans> and to completely disregard my opinion on what sites should be created, is foolish.

2011-05-19T09:34:05  <jimevans> if i was spiteful enough, i could just let those answers stand, and the sqa site would be just another place on the web where you can get crappy information.
2011-05-19T09:34:22  <Ivog> To have an overlapping site instead of a browser automatiob site
2011-05-19T09:35:07  <jimevans> no, i'm sorry, i still completely disagree. either "the community runs [StackExchange]" (their words), or it doesn't
2011-05-19T09:35:31  <jimevans> but if it doesn't, don't hypocritically act like you believe that the community does actually run it.

2011-05-19T10:47:35  <eranm> Hi jimevans
2011-05-19T10:47:50  <jimevans> hi. how's the release coming along?
2011-05-19T10:47:58  <eranm> Ah, I'm just writing an update email
2011-05-19T10:48:11  <eranm> Basically it's blocked by native events not working on Firefox 4
2011-05-19T10:48:15  <jimevans> excellent.
2011-05-19T10:48:22  <eranm> No, not really :)
2011-05-19T10:48:25  <jimevans> well, not excellent that it's blocked,
2011-05-19T10:48:35  <jimevans> but excellent that there's communication on the way.\
2011-05-19T10:48:37  <jimevans> :)
2011-05-19T10:49:10  <jimevans> any chance of getting mousedown/mouseup for ff 3.x checked in?
2011-05-19T10:49:14  <eranm> Did you come across any issues with the IE Driver with older version of IE (6,7) ?
2011-05-19T10:49:18  <eranm> jimevans, yes.
2011-05-19T10:49:44  <jimevans> no, sir. i saw no issues with older versions of IE.
2011-05-19T10:49:50  <eranm> I have it sitting in a client. The only problem is that it's not working properly when scrolling an element into view - if the viewport is bigger than the DOM, it's all working
2011-05-19T10:49:53  <eranm> excellent\
2011-05-19T10:51:09  <jimevans> the .net bindings are in good shape, modulo mousedown/up in ff.
2011-05-19T10:52:24  <jimevans> are you seeing out/getting any help from mozilla re native events?
2011-05-19T10:52:26  <eranm> Could you test Selenium RC with Firefox 4 on a Win7 machine? Simon claimed it's not working but I don't have a Win7 machine to run the tests (./go test-rc)
2011-05-19T10:53:00  <eranm> Only yesterday I got to the stage where Firefox is not crashing and we're using the proper interfaces to get the window handle
2011-05-19T10:53:18  <jimevans> i know what that feels like :)
2011-05-19T10:53:29  <eranm> At that point native events were supposed to work as they always did, except the events are being ignored by Firefox
2011-05-19T10:53:48  <eranm> I'm going to test if it has anything to do with my x_ignore_nofocus library that mucks around with the events sent to the window
2011-05-19T10:54:07  <jimevans> i've got windows 7, but i'll have to upgrade to FF4 to do the test.
2011-05-19T10:54:27  <eranm> You can install it alongside Firefox 3.6, I believe
2011-05-19T10:56:03  <eranm> This Google Music thing is good stuff, very convenient.
2011-05-19T11:14:26  <nirvdrum> jimevans: What's up?
2011-05-19T11:14:59  <jimevans> nothing really. i was going to make a quick joke about r12218

2011-05-19T11:53:41  <eranm> jimevans, are there any known issues with IE8 / WinXP? the file upload test fails, I think it causes the IE Driver to crash.
2011-05-19T11:54:06  <jimevans> ie8 on windows xp. that's not a combination i've tried.
2011-05-19T11:54:24  <jimevans> it's not a *known* issue. :)

2011-05-19T11:57:58  <jimevans> eyesonly: there are a number of tests that handle the multiple window case in the selenium project test bed. i've run them many times on ie with little problem.
2011-05-19T11:58:50  <jimevans> perhaps more context would help to diagnose what you're seeing.
2011-05-19T11:59:44  <eyesonly> I'm testing an SAP application (which is known to be horrid - many iframes/frames, etc)
2011-05-19T12:00:57  <eyesonly> So, the remote client. And I think the ruby gem that I use is selenium webdrive 0.1.4 (fuzzy about the version - it is my windows work machine)
2011-05-19T12:01:16  <jimevans> okay, but what I'm more looking for is how is the page structured? what do you mean when you say "no dice"? does the target window open and you just don't get a handle to it?

2011-05-19T12:02:17  <jimevans> so you can't set protected mode?
2011-05-19T12:02:35  <jimevans> those are usually stored in the current user settings.
2011-05-19T12:03:21  <jimevans> and even if your IT department restricts you from turning protected mode off for all zones, i can't see why they'd restrict you from turning it *on* for all zones.
2011-05-19T12:03:42  <eyesonly> I'm a bit confused about InternetExplorerDriver - if I run java -jar selenium-standalone-2.0b3 that is also internetexplorerdriver, correct?
2011-05-19T12:03:54  <jimevans> yes, it is.
2011-05-19T12:04:21  <jimevans> but you still have to configure the IE settings appropriately for the driver to work.

2011-05-19T12:06:26  <jimevans> that use case (where settings are locked down by group policy) is exactly the one i've worried about, but have no real way to test.
2011-05-19T12:07:16  <eyesonly> Certainly, the site in question, is in the trusted sites zone, and I can't take adjust that due to group policy

2011-05-19T12:07:55  <jimevans> ok, so the site is in trusted sites. that means that protected mode is likely to be off by default.

2011-05-19T12:08:45  <jimevans> however, i'd be surprised if anyone in your IT group would have issues with you running in a *more* restrictive environment.
2011-05-19T12:09:03  <jarib> eyesonly: it could also be a timing issue, where polling for the window to appear may help
2011-05-19T12:09:09  <jimevans> you should try turning Protected Mode on for the Trusted Sites zone.
2011-05-19T12:09:20  <jarib> e.g. Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new.until { driver.window_handles.size > 1 }

2011-05-19T12:14:26  <jimevans> crossing protected mode boundaries causes all manner of heartache for the ie driver.
2011-05-19T12:14:47  <eyesonly> Hey, I'm just grateful it does what it can do
2011-05-19T12:15:54  <__mike> Could someone explain to me how the ChromeDriver.exe fits in with the selenium-java-2.0b3.jar ? It seems it works the same whether that exe is running or not. Or do you need to explicitly connect to it ?
2011-05-19T12:16:19  <jimevans> __mike: 2.0b3 doesn't use the chromedriver.exe.
2011-05-19T12:16:44  <jimevans> the current implementation checked in at the trunk does.
2011-05-19T12:16:58  <__mike> Okay I see
2011-05-19T12:17:38  <jimevans> you'll see the new chromedriver implementation in 2.0rc1, coming as soon as we can get some firefox4 issues resolved.
2011-05-19T12:18:05  <__mike> Do you guys have an approximate ETA for that ?
2011-05-19T12:18:21  <jimevans> as soon as we can get the specific firefox4 issues resolved.
2011-05-19T12:19:15  <__mike> Okay cool. In the meantime would you know why the following code doesn't work for me: http://pastebin.com/kDtGhu9c
2011-05-19T12:19:27  <__mike> The same with InternetExplorerDriver works as expected
2011-05-19T12:19:38  <__mike> I am using Chrome 12
2011-05-19T12:20:14  <jimevans> you're using java and webdriverbackedselenium. that's two reasons i wouldn't be able to help you there. :)
2011-05-19T12:20:57  <__mike> :P
2011-05-19T12:21:52  <__mike> Am I right in saying that the Selenium classes are mostly associated with older versions (1.0) and WebDriver is the newer 'alternative' ? I'm a bit confused how it all fits together
2011-05-19T12:22:44  <jimevans> Selenium 2 is the version number. in Selenium 2, you have two choices of API to use: the Selenium RC API, or the Selenium WebDriver API.
2011-05-19T12:22:56  <jimevans> the Selenium RC API was used in 1.0.
2011-05-19T12:23:16  <jimevans> and there's not much effort being put into that particular API.
2011-05-19T12:23:54  <jimevans> The Selenium WebDriver API is new in Selenium 2, and it's where all the action is in terms of development attention.
2011-05-19T12:25:09  <jimevans> WebDriverBackedSelenium is a bridge class designed to let people who have a large investment in Selenium RC tests to use the newer WebDriver technologies without having to change their tests.
2011-05-19T12:25:17  <__mike> So where does chromedriver.exe fit into all this ?
2011-05-19T12:25:32  <__mike> Okay, yep
2011-05-19T12:25:43  <jimevans> chromedriver.exe is a WebDriver compliant implementation of a driver for the Google Chrome browser.
2011-05-19T12:26:11  <__mike> So why does the current release (2.0b3) not use it at all ? Or does it ?
2011-05-19T12:26:17  <jimevans> The important bit about it is that it's coded, built, and maintained not by the Selenium developers, but by the Chromium team itself.
2011-05-19T12:26:44  <jimevans> it was first released by the Chromium team after 2.0b3 was released.
2011-05-19T12:27:17  <__mike> Ohh okay. Thanks jim
2011-05-19T12:27:39  <jimevans> no problem. hope that helps explain how all the pieces fit together.
2011-05-19T12:28:24  <__mike> So the WebDriver APIs (when not using WebDriverBackedSelenium) actually has the full functionality of using WebDriverBackedSelenium too ?
2011-05-19T12:28:32  <__mike> There are some things that I couldn't find, like mouseover
2011-05-19T12:31:15  <jimevans> okay, WebDriverBackedSelenium presents the Selenium RC API, so it includes all of the commands of that API (which should include mouseOver).
2011-05-19T12:32:13  <__mike> Sorry I mean if you use Web|
2011-05-19T12:32:24  <__mike> WebDriver without using WebDriverBackedSelenium
2011-05-19T12:33:19  <jimevans> Okay, I understand what you're asking now. There are methods in the WebDriver API to handle those things as well.
2011-05-19T12:34:01  <__mike> So I understand you would go about calling methods on the WebElements : http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/index.html
2011-05-19T12:34:14  <__mike> But it seems to have less methods (like mouseover)
2011-05-19T12:34:18  <jimevans> it does.
2011-05-19T12:35:11  <jimevans> For handling things like hovering over an element, dragging and dropping, and so on (what we call advanced user interactions), there are other ways to handle it.
2011-05-19T12:35:31  <__mike> What other ways is this ?
2011-05-19T12:35:42  <jimevans> Unfortunately, that API has changed a bit since 2.0b3.
2011-05-19T12:36:17  <jimevans> So I can give you what the "correct" way of doing it is, but you won't be able to see it in your Java IDE yet.
2011-05-19T12:36:42  <__mike> Oh okay I understand. Please do explain me the new way if it's not too much trouble !
2011-05-19T12:36:45  *** davehunt|away has quit IRC
2011-05-19T12:37:12  <jimevans> What you'd want to do is use the Actions class.
2011-05-19T12:37:42  <jimevans> Bear with me, I'm not really a Java developer, so I'm trying to translate code on the fly.
2011-05-19T12:38:46  <__mike> Okay thank you. A higher level view is very interesting anyway : )
2011-05-19T12:39:54  <jimevans> your code should look something like this: https://gist.github.com/981573
2011-05-19T12:40:29  <jimevans> That would move the mouse over the element in question.
2011-05-19T12:42:12  <__mike> Ahhh that's nice
2011-05-19T12:42:49  <__mike> So it looks like the 'actions/events' are now much more decoupled from WebElements
2011-05-19T12:43:33  <jimevans> Exactly. We still provide convenience methods for a simple click and sending keystrokes, but the actions are now much more decoupled from the actual element.
2011-05-19T12:46:37  <__mike> I think it might be worth it for me to try to check out the trunk sometime. I assume http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/BuildingWebDriver should help to build a 'selenium-java-trunk.jar', right ?

2011-05-19T14:00:27  <__mike> i don't think so. it is just something i came across when using selenium in the past. i patched it and copied it back to the .jar and it works as expected but i'm not familiar with contributing to these sorts of projects so didn't mention it till now

2011-05-19T14:01:37  <eranm> It's quite simple, really. For the IE screenshot open a new issue in the issue tracker for the project and state the change needed

2011-05-19T14:11:35  <__mike> this fails because there is a missing set of quotes. so it caused issues when trying to set a custom homepage for startup. after overriding this with a comparison of "\"about:blank\"" it allowed me to set custom homepages

2011-05-19T14:24:18  <__mike> one more bug off the top of my head that i found today. if you load a page that takes a while to open. even if you call waitforpagetoload() and it returns without timing out, there are times when gettitle() will return an empty string
2011-05-19T14:24:52  <__mike> i do not know why this occurs though. i got around it by looping with thread.sleep(1000) till it gets a non-empty string. usually on 5/6th iteration it gets it
2011-05-19T14:35:34  <__mike> gosh it is late in lithuania..

2011-05-19T14:41:22  <eranm> __mike, such a scenario is definitely reasonable if the title is set by javascript
2011-05-19T14:41:40  <__mike> i don't think so. it is visible by eye.
2011-05-19T14:42:04  <__mike> this only happened with chromedriver
2011-05-19T14:42:09  <__mike> well i didn't test the others
2011-05-19T14:42:09  <eranm> The call to getTitle() completes before you see the page title
2011-05-19T14:42:28  <eranm> so by the time you see it, the correct title is there
2011-05-19T14:42:43  <__mike> nope i am fairly certain because the first few times it calls it is returning empty string and each time is delayed by 1 second
2011-05-19T14:42:55  <__mike> well. you could be right. i shall check tomorrow
2011-05-19T14:43:12  <__mike> but i'm also fairly sure that page's title is fixed, not set by js
2011-05-19T14:43:23  <eranm> __mike, are you using the Selenium 1 API or 2?
2011-05-19T14:43:49  <__mike> used webdriver then webdriverbackedselenium. so i guess selenium 1 api
2011-05-19T14:44:39  <__mike> there is another similar issue i found. however i did not have time to investigate it properly today
2011-05-19T14:46:25  <eranm> I take it you're using the WebDriverBackedSelenium because you want things like waitForPageToLoad ?
2011-05-19T14:48:24  <__mike> actually it is because i didn't know those apis are 'older' and not gonna be supported properly soon
2011-05-19T14:48:35  <__mike> had i known i wouldn't have used them
2011-05-19T14:49:05  <__mike> i actually thought (wrongly) that webdriver is old and selenium 'wrapping' is newer
2011-05-19T14:49:22  <__mike> i didn't realise it was simply providing backwards compatibility
2011-05-19T14:49:55  <__mike> it does say on some places on the site. but i got confused because of the name of the product.. and then things i read on the internet also
2011-05-19T14:50:16  <jimevans> eranm: what do you know about serializing a firefox profile for use with the remote server?

2011-05-19T15:08:53  <eranm> Have a look at the Java code for FirefoxProfile.fromJson
2011-05-19T15:09:06  <jimevans> you can't just do 'new FirefoxProfile()' customize that and send it across the wire right?

2011-05-19T15:12:00  <jimevans> hmm.
2011-05-19T15:12:49  <jimevans> i'm trying to serialize a profile from the .net bindings to be deserialized by the remote server.
2011-05-19T15:14:36  <jimevans> i think the profile creation is identical between the language bindings.
2011-05-19T15:15:45  <jimevans> in java, when you do a 'new FirefoxProfile()', and call toJson(), you get in essense a (base64-encoded) zipped directory containing only a user.js file, right?
2011-05-19T15:20:42  <eranm> checking
2011-05-19T15:22:18  <eranm> If I'm not mistaken, it will contain the extension and user.js

2011-05-19T16:10:18  <jimevans> pretty sure
2011-05-19T16:10:24  <jimevans> though i could be wrong.
2011-05-19T16:11:28  <ivog> dhackner: on that environment are you running tests?
2011-05-19T16:11:33  <ivog> on what
2011-05-19T16:12:24  <dhackner> selenium tests via testng running against a test environment.
2011-05-19T16:12:41  <dhackner> is it an acceptable risk to have code that truncates a main table
2011-05-19T16:12:50  <dhackner> even if it is only supposed to be on the test env?
2011-05-19T16:13:37  <ivog> why dont u delete the entire database and set up a new one at the start of your build
2011-05-19T16:13:39  <ivog> ?
2011-05-19T16:14:05  <jimevans> jarib: is it 'profile.firefox_profile = my_profile' or do i have to serialize the profile class?

2011-05-19T16:14:30  <jimevans> sorry that should be caps.firefox_profile
2011-05-19T16:14:45  <jarib> the caps take care of serialization
2011-05-19T16:14:54  <jimevans> that's what i thought.
2011-05-19T16:14:55  <jarib> you can see what it looks like by doing caps.as_json
2011-05-19T16:15:35  <jarib> (which will return a ruby hash)
2011-05-19T16:16:11  <dhackner> ivog: considering doing that
2011-05-19T16:16:13  <dhackner> but
2011-05-19T16:16:47  <dhackner> each test would need to make it's own DB
2011-05-19T16:16:51  <dhackner> not a huge issue
2011-05-19T16:16:59  <dhackner> but still there is code dropping DBs
2011-05-19T16:17:02  <ivog> each testrun?
2011-05-19T16:17:06  <dhackner> just curious as to others handle it
2011-05-19T16:17:12  <dhackner> 1 run = a slew of tests
2011-05-19T16:17:18  <dhackner> each test case needs a clean env.
2011-05-19T16:17:36  <ivog> why?
2011-05-19T16:17:56  <dhackner> because the data they create could potentially conflict
2011-05-19T16:18:30  <jarib> dhackner: in the rails world it's common to either have a transaction around each test, or truncate/delete after
2011-05-19T16:18:35  <ivog> you can't setup your tests to work like a user would?
2011-05-19T16:18:37  <dhackner> hmm
2011-05-19T16:18:51  <dhackner> a sample test will create an account
2011-05-19T16:19:05  <dhackner> the product wouldn't allow multiple accounts to create
2011-05-19T16:19:09  <dhackner> with the same name
2011-05-19T16:19:17  <jarib> could randomize the name
2011-05-19T16:19:21  <dhackner> jarib: previously I just truncated
2011-05-19T16:19:37  <jarib> what was the problem with truncation?
2011-05-19T16:19:39  <dhackner> thats a trivial example, theres sufficient reason to worry about conflict that cannot be avoided
2011-05-19T16:20:11  <dhackner> long story short, the code is being deployed in a different place and I didn't love the idea of having the code on the server
2011-05-19T16:20:20  <dhackner> it's not necessarily a problem
2011-05-19T16:20:54  <ivog> what about randomizing usernames?
2011-05-19T16:21:05  <dhackner> ivog: theres other data that can conflict
2011-05-19T16:21:11  <dhackner> i've been down the route actually
2011-05-19T16:21:16  <jarib> if you're afraid the code may end up running against a production db, you have bigger problems IMHO :)
2011-05-19T16:21:16  <dhackner> using timestamps basically
2011-05-19T16:21:25  <dhackner> jarib: yea i suppose =-)
2011-05-19T16:21:36  <dhackner> ok, sounds like I'm not nuts to do that then
2011-05-19T16:22:18  <ivog> if you truncate b4 or after each test i suppose parallel tests would become a problem
2011-05-19T16:22:23  <dhackner> they are parallel
2011-05-19T16:22:30  <dhackner> but each thread gets a DB of its own
2011-05-19T16:22:39  <ivog> ok
2011-05-19T16:22:40  <dhackner> so DBs are truncated inbetween runs on the same thread
2011-05-19T16:22:53  <dhackner> how do transactions get rolled back in case of error?
2011-05-19T16:22:59  <dhackner> say the test freaks out and aborts
2011-05-19T16:23:05  <dhackner> and teardown isn't executed
2011-05-19T16:23:38  <jarib> probably depends on the db
2011-05-19T16:23:55  * jarib is not an expert
2011-05-19T16:24:04  <ivog> im able to make my testsuite work like a manual tester would work
2011-05-19T16:24:21  <dhackner> hows that ivog?
2011-05-19T16:24:23  <ivog> so nondeterministic state
2011-05-19T16:24:28  <dhackner> ah
2011-05-19T16:24:33  <dhackner> sure
2011-05-19T16:24:46  <dhackner> i suppose this is for the sake of test developers
2011-05-19T16:24:50  <jarib> i'd assume the db would roll back the transaction if a client disappeared without saying "done"
2011-05-19T16:25:06  <dhackner> don't want to worry about 2 devs trampling each other
2011-05-19T16:25:08  <jimevans> aha! ruby has the same problem as .net for serialzing a new profile.
2011-05-19T16:25:15  <dhackner> better to guarantee a clean env
2011-05-19T16:25:23  <jarib> jimevans: huh!?
2011-05-19T16:25:35  <jimevans> hang on. a gist is forthcoming.
2011-05-19T16:25:41  <jarib> jimevans: and i was just heading to bed.. :)
2011-05-19T16:27:19  <jarib> i did test this back when i wrote that code
2011-05-19T16:28:40  <jimevans> heh. https://gist.github.com/982030
2011-05-19T16:29:10  <jarib> that looks right
2011-05-19T16:29:42  <jimevans> yep. but firefox starts up, and it's acting like it's in first-run.
2011-05-19T16:30:18  <jarib> first-run?
2011-05-19T16:30:22  <jimevans> could be a bug in the remote server or in the java firefox driver deserialization.
2011-05-19T16:30:51  <jarib> but it works from java?
2011-05-19T16:31:11  <jimevans> yeah, with the "welcome to firefox" page and the "check that firefox isn't your default browers" dialog up.
2011-05-19T16:31:32  <jimevans> works from java? that's just crazy talk. i've no idea. :)
2011-05-19T16:31:38  <jarib> haha
2011-05-19T16:31:54  <jarib> ok, i'll go to sleep imagining this is a server issue
2011-05-19T16:31:55  <jimevans> i'm lucky i could think clearly enough to get a ruby repro case.

2011-05-19T22:29:32  <secoif> Hey guys, I'm using the Selenium IDE to generate tests, without having to actually record logging in before every test, how can I set up a 'before' action, or perhaps chain tests with test dependencies or something

2011-05-19T22:41:52  <secoif> just want to ensure the login script always runs before certain tests...
2011-05-19T22:42:05  <secoif> Perhaps a selenium ide plugin?
2011-05-19T22:43:04  <secoif> or do i need to plop it out to rspec and write the additon myself?
