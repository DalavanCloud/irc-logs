2011-09-06T03:00:48  <ztane> having stability issues with FF6.0 and ajax app (jquery + ui); basically, waitForElementPresent name=email in RC succeeds, then immediately after type name=email sometimes fails with "Element name=email not found", any thoughts?
2011-09-06T03:03:20  <ztane> furthermore, tests seem to be mostly stable when run with visible browser window, but more prone to breaking under xvfb

2011-09-06T03:13:32  <AutomatedTester> hey soc42
2011-09-06T03:14:15  <soc42> using selenium ide v1.20 in firefox i try to update a testcase which uses a textfield, that opens a dynamic calendar, but the recorded settings won't playback the values?
2011-09-06T03:16:13  <soc42> i think it's a about xpath:idRelative
2011-09-06T03:16:19  <soc42> how can i fix this?
2011-09-06T03:16:30  <soc42> is xpath supported?
2011-09-06T03:17:39  <AutomatedTester> xpath is supported
2011-09-06T03:17:58  <AutomatedTester> you will have to probably update to xpath=yourXpath as the locator
2011-09-06T03:20:56  <soc42> you mean prepend "xpath=" to the recorded values?
2011-09-06T03:23:52  <AutomatedTester> yea
2011-09-06T03:24:22  <AutomatedTester> but also remember the IDE does its best at recording, you *may* need to work on the locator yourselve

2011-09-06T04:55:30  <ato> The by string passed by remote web driver is different to the one used in the atoms.
2011-09-06T04:55:46  <ato> This means we have to convert them from the “nice” format to the JS method name used int he atoms.
2011-09-06T04:55:49  <simonstewart> I think that's right

2011-09-06T04:57:38  <ato> Would it make sense to move this method to RemoteWebDriver somewhere?
2011-09-06T04:57:58  <simonstewart> It would make more sense to normalise everything
2011-09-06T04:59:00  <simonstewart> Which should be easy enough to add to the atoms
2011-09-06T04:59:45  <ato> So that RemoteWebDriver sent the actual method names?
2011-09-06T05:00:03  <simonstewart> So you don't need to do the conversion
2011-09-06T05:00:19  <jarib> atm we send 'class name' across the wire
2011-09-06T05:00:22  <jarib> IIRC
2011-09-06T05:00:24  <simonstewart> Basically, we use the translated by from your example to look up a property of the lcoators map
2011-09-06T05:00:30  <simonstewart> Right, and that's lovely
2011-09-06T05:00:34  <simonstewart> we should keep doing that

2011-09-06T05:00:55  <ato> jarib: Indeed.
2011-09-06T05:00:57  <jarib> so the translation doesn't happen in the driver.

2011-09-06T05:18:02  <Parabola> simonstewart: hmm, i had one big method for each test, and i read in docs that you shouldnt do that
2011-09-06T05:18:07  <Parabola> you should make them as small as possible
2011-09-06T05:18:17  <Parabola> so i have each step of the web testing in its own method
2011-09-06T05:19:36  <dennisstam> implicit timeout? it does seem to wait 30 seconds before giving in, I could raise it to, say, 50 but doubt that'd help
2011-09-06T05:19:48  <simonstewart> In that case, I think that one large method is preferable

2011-09-06T05:27:47  <Parabola> hi jim
2011-09-06T05:29:00  <Parabola> I kinda feel like I should keep going on my original version, where i was doing it all myself :-\
2011-09-06T05:29:16  <Parabola> might be the best learning experience, i'm learning a framework while i'm still trying to learn the language
2011-09-06T05:30:56  <Parabola> correct me if i'm wrong, but wouldnt you want to know a language first so you can leverage the frameworks?
2011-09-06T05:31:12  <Parabola> or rather, can you really leverage a framework without a good understanding of the language
2011-09-06T05:31:21  <__mike> no you can't
2011-09-06T05:31:58  <__mike> you can probably get away with doing simple things if the framework is well made but eventually when you want to do more sophisticated things, you'll end up frustrated and unsure where to go
2011-09-06T05:32:10  <Parabola> thats how ive been feeling over the last week
2011-09-06T05:32:16  <dennisstam> been there _o/
2011-09-06T05:32:42  <Parabola> this is my first time programming, and the testing frameworks have made it harder
2011-09-06T05:32:45  <Parabola> testNG destroyed me
2011-09-06T05:32:52  <__mike> why don't you use junit
2011-09-06T05:33:02  <simonstewart> That's what we said in the end
2011-09-06T05:33:04  <Parabola> Thats what i'm doing now, but i'm finding it worse off than what i already had coded
2011-09-06T05:33:07  <simonstewart> Parabola's there now
2011-09-06T05:33:13  <__mike> not because it's 'better', but because there's a hell of a lot more examples for it around
2011-09-06T05:33:30  <__mike> it's okay. start off now and come ask when you get stuck on the basic things
2011-09-06T05:33:37  <__mike> or don't understand quite why you're typing something out but it works

2011-09-06T05:38:09  <__mike> Ahhh
2011-09-06T05:38:13  <__mike> Oh I see

2011-09-06T05:38:55  <Parabola> and during this entire journey i've had to run it against one a time, because i don't know how to create some loop that would do it for me

2011-09-06T05:41:27  *** OperaDriver has left #selenium
2011-09-06T05:41:36  <__mike> IMO there are 2 approaches for this. Have the 'loop' inside a test (which I think is bad, but by far the easier way). 2nd approach is to make a custom JUnit runner which pulls out the browsers you want to run against from some sort of custom annotation. This is difficult and requires quite a bit of work but I have implemented exactly this
2011-09-06T05:42:23  <Parabola> and i know how to do exactly 0 of those
2011-09-06T05:42:27  <__mike> You can do a lot of powerful stuff if you make your own runner. Like running the tests concurrently. Or customising exactly the circumstances which pass/fail a tes
2011-09-06T05:42:29  <__mike> *test
2011-09-06T05:42:35  <Parabola> and due to my lack of knowledge i'm having a hard time googling for answers
2011-09-06T05:42:46  <Parabola> because i'm not asking the right questiions
2011-09-06T05:43:06  <Parabola> for what its worth, i think its retarded that the hub doesnt keep a list of what nodes have been added to it
2011-09-06T05:43:18  <Parabola> since the nodes have to register with the hub anyway, why not make that information availible?
2011-09-06T05:43:30  <Parabola> ie, i tell it to run against all the IE's, or just every single node
2011-09-06T05:43:38  <__mike> Right. Probably the custom runner isn't the smart way to go. So is this an acceptable solution for you? Defining a list of browsers as strings. Then looping in a test, taking each string and creating a driver which runs test contents?

2011-09-06T05:56:32  <__mike> browsers is a list of Browsers. The for loop is using an enhanced for loop to go through and say 'for each' browser, create a driver of that type, run the test then quit the driver

2011-09-06T06:05:26  <jimevans> java's Actions class has the same challenge, though java doesn't have extension methods.
2011-09-06T06:05:49  <simonstewart> We just allow people to subclass our Actions class and do what they will
2011-09-06T06:05:56  <jimevans> i'm considering adding a protected AddAction() method, allowing users to subclass.

2011-09-06T07:01:06  <soc42> while have the ide plugin open after starting firefox, you can open and add testcases to a testsuite
2011-09-06T07:01:53  <soc42> now having selected test case no.1 you have to double-click to switch to another test-case, e.g. test case no.2

2011-09-06T07:03:07  <soc42> so the settings of the wrong test case no.1 get changed, while the selection of test case no.2 was expected to be displayed
2011-09-06T07:03:55  <soc42> so beware and always use doubleclick or better change the behaviour of the selection to automatically reload the test cases' detail while just single clicking

2011-09-06T07:09:14  <Parabola> shit just crashes and burns
2011-09-06T07:09:34  <Parabola> simonstewart: right, i dont have a solid understanding of the language, and its my fault for using a testing frameworik
2011-09-06T07:09:38  <__mike> just hit ctrl-shift-o and it should resolve all the imports
2011-09-06T07:09:45  * Parabola sighs
2011-09-06T07:09:47  <simonstewart> Using a testing framework is a good idea
2011-09-06T07:09:52  <Parabola> theres nothing wrong with my god damn imports
2011-09-06T07:09:58  <simonstewart> It's just that you're at the bottom of a steep learning curve
2011-09-06T07:10:00  <Parabola> simonstewart: if you know the language
2011-09-06T07:10:07  <Parabola> i would totally agree
2011-09-06T07:10:13  <simonstewart> That's what I mean
2011-09-06T07:10:20  <Parabola> right, which as i've said i don't
2011-09-06T07:10:20  <simonstewart> You're learning the language and the API at the same time
2011-09-06T07:10:27  <Parabola> so i shouldn't be using one :
2011-09-06T07:10:38  <__mike> you're not asking the right questions to understand. and you're not giving us the information to help you
2011-09-06T07:10:41  <simonstewart> How are you running the tests?
2011-09-06T07:10:51  <Parabola> __mike: oh i'm aware, thats why its so frustrating
2011-09-06T07:10:56  <Parabola> if i knew what i needed to ask, i could google this all out :)

2011-09-06T07:11:28  <__mike> so you said your tests are crashing with NPE. well they shouldn't be. so you should paste the code you're using and the error you get and we'd help you figure it out
2011-09-06T07:11:41  <simonstewart> __mike has a point
2011-09-06T07:12:21  <Fry33_> barancev, I little change code https://gist.github.com/1197676 and it doesn't work, could you look at it please
2011-09-06T07:14:47  <Parabola> i understand
2011-09-06T07:14:53  <Parabola> and i appreciate the help, i will paste once i've tried something
2011-09-06T07:15:03  <Parabola> if i can i'd much rather figure this out the hard way on my own :)
2011-09-06T07:15:11  <Parabola> changing things up a bit
2011-09-06T07:15:49  <__mike> it's okay to ask when you're lacking conceptual understanding, it's probably the fastest, least frustrating way. but, up to you
2011-09-06T07:15:57  <AutomatedTester> Parabola: your boss wants you to pick up Java, has he given you a mentor?
2011-09-06T07:16:08  <__mike> yeah that's me
2011-09-06T07:16:30  <__mike> kidding ;)
2011-09-06T07:17:11  <Parabola> :P
2011-09-06T07:17:11  <Parabola> you're hired
2011-09-06T07:17:40  <AutomatedTester> Parabola: it was a serious question, your boss should give you a mentor to help you go
2011-09-06T07:17:55  <Parabola> i know, and he did, one of our devs
2011-09-06T07:18:01  <Parabola> but to be honest, its not worth asking
2011-09-06T07:18:10  <Parabola> his accent is so thick, i cannot understand what he says
2011-09-06T07:18:13  <AutomatedTester> not worth asking/?
2011-09-06T07:18:17  <Parabola> and he refuses to use IM or email, its gotta be on the phone
2011-09-06T07:18:21  <Parabola> and he just confuses me more

2011-09-06T07:34:05  <Parabola> just to make sure i'm reading this right, the pageobjects pattern in a nutshell is take each functional part of a page, and put all needed logic to interact with it, within a single method?
2011-09-06T07:34:33  *** Ari-Ugwu has quit IRC
2011-09-06T07:34:51  <__mike> no. think of it like a state machine. every page or view is a class. every method is the actions that can happen on that page. if that action leads to another page, the method should return an instance of the new page
2011-09-06T07:35:03  <__mike> in this way, you can chain them

2011-09-06T07:43:41  <barancev> Fry33_: if you keep you mouse untouched, it is blue for ~5sec, as expected
2011-09-06T07:44:39  <Parabola> when using junit4, i noticed that its nicer, and easier to read when there is a failure, when every step is in its own test
2011-09-06T07:44:51  <Parabola> if i have 20 steps on one page, and theres a failure
2011-09-06T07:44:59  <Parabola> how am I to know which one it happened on
2011-09-06T07:45:06  <__mike> you can see the stacktrace
2011-09-06T07:45:13  <__mike> test methods shouldn't be reliant on one another
2011-09-06T07:45:18  <Parabola> let me rephrase
2011-09-06T07:45:32  <Parabola> something useful that doesnt require someone to be using eclipse..
2011-09-06T07:45:43  <Parabola> i'm going to be packaging this up, and our devs and my coworkers can run it.
2011-09-06T07:45:56  <Parabola> and it will need to output some HTML logs with the status of the tests (why i liked testNG)
2011-09-06T07:46:05  <__mike> catch the exceptions and rethrow them with a helpful message
2011-09-06T07:46:17  <Parabola> k.. if i do that work
2011-09-06T07:46:21  <Parabola> what the hell is the point of using junit?
2011-09-06T07:46:37  <Parabola> maybe i'm not seeing this right, but in my mind the point of a test framework would be to make your life easier
2011-09-06T07:46:43  <Parabola> if i have to handle the exceptions myself
2011-09-06T07:46:48  <Parabola> whats the point
2011-09-06T07:47:01  <Fry33_> barancev, you right, i just try to maximuse window manually. so, there's no way to hold mouse on element long time( or until next action ). ?
2011-09-06T07:47:13  <__mike> well i guess if you name your methods appropriately, it should be clear where they fail. the only places a test should fail is where you're doing assertions
2011-09-06T07:47:35  <Parabola> right, which i am on every step
2011-09-06T07:47:48  <barancev> Fry33_: just don't touch the mouse while selenium runs your tests :)
2011-09-06T07:48:04  <barancev> use Thread.sleep between actions
2011-09-06T07:48:30  <Parabola> __mike: https://gist.github.com/7f0edd823e39e5edfda6
2011-09-06T07:48:36  <Parabola> thats what i've got right now
2011-09-06T07:48:42  <barancev> there is a request #2259, but it is not implemented yet

2011-09-06T07:48:48  <Fry33_> But would it work with grid where work 5+ browsers at one moment

2011-09-06T07:49:10  <Parabola> i dont know why github did that
2011-09-06T07:49:55  <barancev> I'm not sure if you can use Actions with Grid (or just RemoteWebDriver)
2011-09-06T07:51:02  <__mike> yes you can
2011-09-06T07:51:05  <__mike> let me look at that code now

2011-09-06T07:52:08  <Parabola> you guys keep telling me the order and such doesnt matter
2011-09-06T07:52:16  <Parabola> but thats not correct at all for interactive tests
2011-09-06T07:52:16  <__mike> gosh
2011-09-06T07:52:21  <Parabola> right now i'm placing test orders
2011-09-06T07:52:30  <Parabola> and the steps obviously MUST go in order
2011-09-06T07:52:33  <Parabola> or it wont work at all
2011-09-06T07:52:47  <Parabola> so how is the pageObject pattern going to help with this
2011-09-06T07:53:06  *** bracki has quit IRC
2011-09-06T07:54:21  <__mike> a test would probably look more like this
2011-09-06T07:54:22  <__mike> http://pastebin.com/LvB8zXDG
2011-09-06T07:54:33  <__mike> i don't think you should be asserting that elements are present
2011-09-06T07:54:38  <AutomatedTester> Parabola: Page Objects is a design pattern to help you create more maintainable and readable tests
2011-09-06T07:55:00  <__mike> i'd think you can assume they're there?
2011-09-06T07:55:01  <Parabola> right, but in my case it would go HomePage() to LoginPage() back to HomePage()
2011-09-06T07:55:04  <Parabola> and that wont work
2011-09-06T07:55:07  <__mike> why not?
2011-09-06T07:55:28  <Parabola> beacause the homepage method will be run first
2011-09-06T07:55:41  <Parabola> how will it start doing things that require you to be logged in
2011-09-06T07:56:08  <__mike> right. each test should be independent. if you need to login for each one then you could put that as part of @Before i guess
2011-09-06T07:56:09  <Parabola> mike: i did that so i had some error messages
2011-09-06T07:56:21  <Parabola> im about to scream
2011-09-06T07:56:22  <__mike> what error messages
2011-09-06T07:56:30  <Parabola> ..the strings?
2011-09-06T07:56:35  <Parabola> that say "unable to locate yourmom"
2011-09-06T07:58:30  <AutomatedTester> Parabola: what is o in your gist earlier
2011-09-06T07:59:07  *** andytinkham has joined #selenium

2011-09-06T08:00:51  <__mike> if it still fails after an appropriate implicit wait, i'd just fail the test

2011-09-06T08:01:32  <ralecsan> hi ppl. i was wondering if anybody encountered the following problem: using htmlunitdriver the part after # in an url gets discarded.
2011-09-06T08:01:35  <__mike> just set that after you create your webdriver
2011-09-06T08:02:17  <Parabola> mike, thats a small detail
2011-09-06T08:02:30  <Parabola> i dont need to worry about that right now.
2011-09-06T08:02:41  <Parabola> the bigger issue is the further i go ahead with these test frameworks
2011-09-06T08:02:42  *** cerberos has quit IRC
2011-09-06T08:02:48  <Parabola> the worse off I seem to be
2011-09-06T08:02:54  <__mike> it's not a small detail. it's the reason your tests are failing
2011-09-06T08:03:08  <__mike> without that, they'll fail whether or not you are using a framework
2011-09-06T08:03:12  <Parabola> what i just pasted you isnt failing
2011-09-06T08:03:28  <Parabola> unless you're talking about some other gist i posted a while ago
2011-09-06T08:03:44  <__mike> unable to locate... errors are because the element wasnt there yet
2011-09-06T08:04:21  <Parabola> I never said that.
2011-09-06T08:04:28  <Parabola> i never said they were failing
2011-09-06T08:05:05  <__mike> [16:08] <Parabola> that say "unable to locate yourmom"
2011-09-06T08:05:24  <Parabola> okay, im not explaining that all, it will take too long, i need to get back to coding
2011-09-06T08:05:29  <Parabola> however, you ARE misreading what i was saying
2011-09-06T08:05:32  <Parabola> and what the code is
2011-09-06T08:05:35  <Parabola> and there is NO issue with that

2011-09-06T08:10:34  <Parabola> my code that worked perfectly falls flat on its face when i use testNG or Junit, so i started writing everything over again :)
2011-09-06T08:10:44  <Parabola> nah, lets get rid of junit and keep selenium :P
2011-09-06T08:10:54  <freynaud> Parabola: testing isn't that hard, but assuming you can have something working within a week when you discover the language and the framework is a bit optimistiv
2011-09-06T08:11:05  <barnex> ato: well, I'm using selenium server and ruby API, but thanks
2011-09-06T08:11:25  <AutomatedTester> Parabola: sorry if this comes across harsh but if you want people to give a damn about your CV you need to know JUnit or TestNG

2011-09-06T08:11:52  <Parabola> AutomatedTester: and once i learn the language, I will learn them. i'm a systems admin, my CV is monitoring tools, AIX and Linux
2011-09-06T08:11:57  <barnex> the github says, that there is environment variable available, so I'll try using that
2011-09-06T08:12:00  <Parabola> i'm not a developer
2011-09-06T08:12:12  <AutomatedTester> Parabola: but you are writing Selenium tests right?
2011-09-06T08:12:17  <AutomatedTester> in Java?
2011-09-06T08:12:22  <Parabola> yes, but to worry about my CV now is retarded
2011-09-06T08:12:24  <AutomatedTester> that sounds like development to me

2011-09-06T08:12:31  <__mike> Parabola, there are people here who are giving you advice for the long-term, whether that's next week, next month or 3 months from now. Your tests will not work and be unmaintainable if you just focus on your shortterm
2011-09-06T08:12:57  * Dude-X wants to port the entire test suite to Python. 
2011-09-06T08:13:04  <Parabola> i understand that, but saying "all your stuffs wrong go look at some patterns and junit" doesnt really help
2011-09-06T08:13:05  * Dude-X will begin a skunkworks project...
2011-09-06T08:13:10  <AutomatedTester> Dude-X: *high 5*

2011-09-06T08:13:34  <jimevans> Parabola: quick question: were you able to get any test to run using a single browser version and either junit or testng?
2011-09-06T08:13:49  <Parabola> yes, both
2011-09-06T08:13:53  <barnex> Ok, I'm not sure how this is supposed to work. Is opera driver embedded in selenium server standalone?
2011-09-06T08:14:01  <jimevans> perhaps leaving aside the requirement to loop through all of the browsers you need to test on (at least for the moment) would help.
2011-09-06T08:14:03  <Parabola> barnex: theres a wikipage on that
2011-09-06T08:14:04  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: I think Parabola should do a simple assertEquals(1,1) in java
2011-09-06T08:14:07  <AutomatedTester> and then build up
2011-09-06T08:14:12  <Parabola> jimevans: thats all i'm trying to get working right now
2011-09-06T08:14:17  <Parabola> i got everything else
2011-09-06T08:14:19  <AutomatedTester> thats my 2c
2011-09-06T08:14:42  <Parabola> that was the only reason i started looking at testing frameworks in the first place
2011-09-06T08:14:53  <Parabola> that and testNGs awesome html logs it generates
2011-09-06T08:14:58  <Parabola> which, it appears junit does not
2011-09-06T08:14:59  *** rhineshell has quit IRC
2011-09-06T08:15:07  <jimevans> and i think trying to use a unit testing framework to loop through different configurations is like using a sledgehammer to drive in a screw. it might get the job done, but in my opinion is the wrong tool for the job.

2011-09-06T08:15:36  <Dude-X> AutomatedTester: only downside to secretly porting to python is that i have to understand Nose. but it shouldn't take long to wrap my mind around it
2011-09-06T08:15:40  <Parabola> i've got a nice driver loop, thanks to mike
2011-09-06T08:16:01  <AutomatedTester> Dude-X: sorry to hear about that, I use Py.Test and <3 it
2011-09-06T08:16:04  <Parabola> now I just need to figure out how i should have my tests written
2011-09-06T08:16:15  <Parabola> i had each test in its own method, junit was failing
2011-09-06T08:16:22  <Parabola> google told me to break them up, i did and they work

2011-09-06T08:16:39  <Dude-X> ah another project uses python webdriver with nose. but i'll look at Py.Test
2011-09-06T08:16:56  <Parabola> i have sally mae, they are horrible
2011-09-06T08:16:58  <AutomatedTester> Dude-X: we use py.test in Mozilla for our tests
2011-09-06T08:17:35  <AutomatedTester> btw, a CI should handle the browsers you want to test, not a loop
2011-09-06T08:18:09  <Dude-X> AutomatedTester: do you know Tarek Ziade?
2011-09-06T08:18:19  <__mike> Ahh AutomatedTester: probably better to keep it simple for now...
2011-09-06T08:18:19  <jimevans> Parabola: AutomatedTester is exactly right, but that's sprinting, when you're just learning to crawl, much less walk. :)
2011-09-06T08:18:29  <barnex> Ok, so I set OPERA_PATH="C:\Program files\Opera\opera.exe" and run selenium-standalone-server

2011-09-06T08:19:12  <Parabola> thats fine, setting up a CI is much more my realm anyway
2011-09-06T08:19:20  <AutomatedTester> QA are all about py.test so we can do things in parallel
2011-09-06T08:19:23  <AutomatedTester> and do it properly
2011-09-06T08:19:24  <__mike> no. you want working tests first
2011-09-06T08:19:38  <Parabola> for the millionth time i have working tests
2011-09-06T08:19:44  <Parabola> i forked my project
2011-09-06T08:19:50  <Parabola> i will just delete all this shit
2011-09-06T08:19:52  <Dude-X> hmm okay; i'm officially QA so i should look at py.test
2011-09-06T08:20:15  <jimevans> that's why I asked about the single-browser case. once you have that, you can use jenkins (or something similar) to handle the case of "execute these tests on different browser platforms"
2011-09-06T08:20:29  <jimevans> and it sounds like you have the single-browser case working.
2011-09-06T08:20:34  <AutomatedTester> Dude-X: Nose can't handle doing tests in parallel and creating xunit reports for CIs
2011-09-06T08:20:44  <Parabola> yeah, had that two weeks ago

2011-09-06T08:49:38  <AutomatedTester> you have tests running, woot!
2011-09-06T08:50:02  <Parabola> Yeah
2011-09-06T08:50:06  <Parabola> with one browser
2011-09-06T08:50:12  <Parabola> so the lovely loop mike generated i am not using
2011-09-06T08:50:18  <AutomatedTester> and using a framework
2011-09-06T08:50:31  <Parabola> so right now each step of my test steps are within an assertTrue

2011-09-06T08:51:21  <AutomatedTester> Parabola: only assert when you need to
2011-09-06T08:51:26  <Parabola> AutomatedTester: k
2011-09-06T08:51:36  <AutomatedTester> if you need to know something then assert
2011-09-06T08:51:50  <Parabola> well i need to know if someone moves or renames an element
2011-09-06T08:51:58  <Parabola> if it fails, i want to know exactly which step in the report
2011-09-06T08:52:15  <AutomatedTester> I would personally assert that you can do certain functionality
2011-09-06T08:52:18  <AutomatedTester> thats how I test
2011-09-06T08:52:25  <Parabola> wait what
2011-09-06T08:52:29  <Parabola> that was broken english
2011-09-06T08:53:03  <AutomatedTester> assertions for me should only be checking that I can do certain functional tasks on the page
2011-09-06T08:53:43  <AutomatedTester> click A, assert X is on the new page, type C, assert that Y is on the page that happens when I type
2011-09-06T08:53:51  <Parabola> thats what i'm doing
2011-09-06T08:54:00  <AutomatedTester> groovy then
2011-09-06T08:54:03  <Parabola> kinda anyway
2011-09-06T08:54:11  <Parabola> assertTrue("Unable to locate Login link", o.elementClicker(driver, By.linkText("Login")));
2011-09-06T08:54:25  <Parabola> clicks login, if its not there, provides the string
2011-09-06T08:54:33  <Parabola> is that what you were referring to
2011-09-06T08:54:46  <AutomatedTester> I would just click the link, if its not there an exception will be thrown and the testing framework will catch it and log it
2011-09-06T08:54:51  <Parabola> kk
2011-09-06T08:54:54  <AutomatedTester> I wouldnt wrap it in an assert
2011-09-06T08:55:13  <jimevans> Parabola: i may be misunderstanding, but you keep refering to "order" in your tests. help me understand what is currently defined as a test in your environment.
2011-09-06T08:55:14  <Parabola> but lets say its step 2 of 10 that fail in that method
2011-09-06T08:55:36  <Parabola> the error in the report from the framework will say the method failed
2011-09-06T08:55:49  <Parabola> how am i to know exactly which step?
2011-09-06T08:55:56  <Parabola> If i have to go figure it out then the whole thing is pointless
2011-09-06T08:56:03  <jimevans> Parabola: yes, and the stack trace in the failure report should tell you what line of code failed.

2011-09-06T08:57:34  <Parabola> i cant say "oh go open eclipse"
2011-09-06T08:57:38  <Parabola> "add logging"
2011-09-06T08:57:50  <Parabola> if i knew how to do that i would never have bothered with a testing framework in the first place
2011-09-06T08:58:04  <AutomatedTester> Parabola: are you testing an app?
2011-09-06T08:58:12  <Parabola> what is "an app"
2011-09-06T08:58:23  <AutomatedTester> app == application
2011-09-06T08:58:31  <Parabola> thats vague
2011-09-06T08:58:33  <Parabola> something that has a purpose or function? yes
2011-09-06T08:58:49  <AutomatedTester> are you testing a website?
2011-09-06T08:58:56  <AutomatedTester> or are you doing automation on a website?
2011-09-06T08:58:57  <Parabola> yes.
2011-09-06T08:59:03  <Parabola> both
2011-09-06T08:59:10  <Parabola> right now, im placing orders on our website
2011-09-06T08:59:14  <Parabola> i will be doing more
2011-09-06T08:59:24  <Parabola> i will be ensuring a big dumbass list of business requirements
2011-09-06T08:59:26  <AutomatedTester> is it to replace a human doing it?
2011-09-06T08:59:36  <Parabola> no its to replace an expensive 3rd party service thats doing it
2011-09-06T08:59:44  <Parabola> and the business requirements because that is a manual human process
2011-09-06T08:59:58  <Parabola> the only requirement I know of right now is "ensure our logo is on every one of our pages"
2011-09-06T09:00:04  <Parabola> and i will be given a list of our pages
2011-09-06T09:00:09  <Parabola> why do you ask
2011-09-06T09:00:20  <Parabola> the business requirements won't need to be in any real order
2011-09-06T09:00:24  <AutomatedTester> if you are testing you need a testing framework
2011-09-06T09:00:25  <Parabola> but this shit needs to be
2011-09-06T09:00:42  <Parabola> no you dont
2011-09-06T09:00:46  *** Ajay has joined #selenium
2011-09-06T09:00:50  <AutomatedTester> if you are doing a process automation then you dont need a testing framework
2011-09-06T09:01:47  <AutomatedTester> if you are checking a logo is in place, you need to use a testing framework because you get asserts
2011-09-06T09:01:47  <Parabola> so what you're now telling me is, what i've been saying and showing you with code all day, i shouldnt be using a testing framework
2011-09-06T09:02:03  <Parabola> may i ask why this was kept a secret until now
2011-09-06T09:02:06  <AutomatedTester> Parabola: are you checking a logo is in a certain place?
2011-09-06T09:02:16  <Parabola> alright, i'm done for the day

2011-09-06T09:02:31  <AutomatedTester> are you checking you can do it in many browsers?
2011-09-06T09:02:35  <Parabola> i'm going to start being rather unprofessional if I stay, thank you very very much for all of your help
2011-09-06T09:02:44  <Parabola> I hope you enjoy the rest of your day mate

2011-09-06T09:07:05  <Parabola> register your nodes with it
2011-09-06T09:07:08  <Parabola> so its already there
2011-09-06T09:07:10  <XRayCulver> but you still have to specify it in the nodes?
2011-09-06T09:07:20  <Parabola> you dont

2011-09-06T09:07:27  <freynaud> what do you see as a capability
2011-09-06T09:07:30  <Parabola> if you call for IE and no version, it will just pick one

2011-09-06T09:10:37  <__mike> Btw Parabola, the exception he posted with a missing version is fine. It just means he didn't specify one in his test. It should match with any registered IE browser.
2011-09-06T09:11:15  <XRayCulver> whats the filetype you can store the node capabilities?

2011-09-06T09:13:40  <__mike> That's fine
2011-09-06T09:13:51  <__mike> I suspect it's the fact you didn't specify the platform as WINDOWS

2011-09-06T09:44:40  <simonstewart> Thanks :)
2011-09-06T09:45:03  <Ajay> Are the exception messages in the first gist fine ?
2011-09-06T09:45:38  <simonstewart> Not sure
2011-09-06T09:45:51  <simonstewart> That's why we have tests to define the behaviour
2011-09-06T09:46:01  <simonstewart> I think that the concensus on the list was that clear should throw
2011-09-06T09:46:36  <simonstewart> Probably an InvalidElementStateException
2011-09-06T09:46:45  <simonstewart> If the element was readonly or disabled
2011-09-06T09:47:11  <Ajay> here are the Tests https://gist.github.com/1198169
2011-09-06T09:47:55  <simonstewart> ElementNotEditableException -> InvalidElementStateException
2011-09-06T09:48:32  <Ajay> Changing now
2011-09-06T09:49:02  <simonstewart> if you're expecting an exception, put a "fail" immediately after the problem
2011-09-06T09:49:23  <simonstewart> So you probably want to move line 65 out of the try/catch block as it'll never be called
2011-09-06T09:49:54  <simonstewart> In addition, you can call the caught exception "ignored" or "expected" and avoid the comment in the empty try/catch blocks
2011-09-06T09:51:24  <Ajay> yeah , the line 65 was there because of Other drivers except HtmlunitDriver wouldnot throw any exception

2011-09-06T10:01:13  <XRayCulver> what is the issue with this warning in grid2? WARNING: WARNING : using a beforeSession on a proxy that can support multiple tests is risky.
2011-09-06T10:01:32  <freynaud> XRayCulver, it's a warning, saying it's risky :)
2011-09-06T10:01:39  <XRayCulver> what is beforeSession?
2011-09-06T10:02:10  <freynaud> a hook executed before a test starts ( before the session is found on the grid )
2011-09-06T10:03:16  <freynaud> it's not very clear I agree. I should say : risky if you use it to plug some system wide stuff
2011-09-06T10:03:31  <XRayCulver> ah
2011-09-06T10:03:35  <XRayCulver> thanks for the info
2011-09-06T10:03:52  <freynaud> like myVM.delete(); If you do something like that, you impact your current test, but also all the test on the same node. It's risky :)

2011-09-06T10:56:35  <Dude-X> is the python version of selenium webdriver pure python?
2011-09-06T10:58:46  <lukeis> pure python? webdriver isn't really pure anything.... but yeah, you don't need anything other than python and the browser for FF and IE (chrome you need chromedriver too)
2011-09-06T11:00:10  <Dude-X> pure as in all the source files are .py, like there's no C files or whatever
2011-09-06T11:00:41  <lukeis> well... Firefox uses an .xpi (plugin) and IE uses a .dll ... they are all bundled inside the pypi
2011-09-06T11:01:01  <lukeis> otherwise all python ;)
2011-09-06T11:01:13  <Dude-X> neat
2011-09-06T11:01:20  <lukeis> the .dll is created with C++ :)

2011-09-06T11:03:23  <lukeis> setting a profile? do you have a profile you want to use? or need to tweak a setting in python?
2011-09-06T11:04:09  <Dude-X> is it webdriver.firefox('profile/path')
2011-09-06T11:05:16  <lukeis> firefoxProfile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile('profile/path'); driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile= firefoxProfile);

2011-09-06T11:18:49  <barnex> When i connect to the remote it starts opera
2011-09-06T11:19:00  <barnex> but opera displays opera:debug and doesn't respond to commands
2011-09-06T11:19:08  *** AutomatedTester has quit IRC
2011-09-06T11:19:19  <barnex> and I can't google nothing useful about that behaviour
2011-09-06T11:19:39  <barnex> well, I can set automatic proxy connection, but I still don't know where to connect
2011-09-06T11:21:18  <marcusalmeida> thx
2011-09-06T11:22:00  <barnex> well, I can connect to my selenium-server
2011-09-06T11:22:15  <barnex> but creating new WebDriver opens new opera window anyway :o
2011-09-06T11:23:31  <marcusalmeida> i'm having problems with proxy in my company, when i run some tests. Where could i settings the information about proxy ?
2011-09-06T11:23:51  <barnex> well, it's debugging proxy, not the web proxy
2011-09-06T11:23:56  <barnex> but try opera:config anyway
2011-09-06T11:24:15  <barnex> if there's something it's there
2011-09-06T11:25:45  <ato> If you're using Opera 11.51, you don't have to click Connect.  Proxy Auto Connect will be enabled by default.
2011-09-06T11:26:13  <ato> barnex: Are you using the Selenium standalone server 2.5?
2011-09-06T11:27:14  <barnex> yes, and opera 11.51 :o
2011-09-06T11:28:34  <barnex> unless server's filename is lying
2011-09-06T11:31:22  <ato> Is it connecting to the server?
2011-09-06T11:32:26  <barnex> Yes, when I manually connect it registers
2011-09-06T11:32:34  <barnex> but even when I manually connect beforehand
2011-09-06T11:32:39  <barnex> I can't use this instance
2011-09-06T11:32:49  <barnex> because server starts new unconnected instance
2011-09-06T11:35:36  <barnex> well, at least sometimes it connects
2011-09-06T11:36:13  <barnex> after a while of connecting/disconnecting I need to restart selenium-server
2011-09-06T11:36:26  <barnex> and some other stuff, like requesting opera
2011-09-06T11:37:06  <barnex> I realize information I provide are borderline useless, but I'm working over slow vnc and can't really test a lot efficiently
2011-09-06T11:39:11  <ato> Do you have Opera running already on your system?  Are you making sure it's closed in between when you start your script?
2011-09-06T11:42:17  <barnex> well, I'm using interactive ruby to connect, because I was trying different things with capabilities

2011-09-06T11:42:34  <barnex> ok, irb restarted, selenium server restarted, no signs of opera in task manager
2011-09-06T11:42:44  <ato> I'm not sure I completely understand the problem.
2011-09-06T11:42:58  <ato> Can you make a script that reproduces the problem consistently?

2011-09-06T11:46:38  <barnex> after creation of driver server opens opera instance pointed to opera:debug and asking for debugger
2011-09-06T11:47:18  <barnex> at that point connecting to the debugger won't navigate to google.com
2011-09-06T11:47:48  <barnex> and server will kill opera, complaining about it not responding in timely fashion
2011-09-06T11:48:16  <ato> Sounds like it isn't connecting at all to me.
2011-09-06T11:48:22  <barnex> If I connect opera to server before running the script, the act of running a script will start another instance
2011-09-06T11:49:17  <barnex> Oh yes
2011-09-06T11:49:31  <barnex> I think I can only connect opera to selenium server before selenium server starts opera
2011-09-06T11:49:35  <ato> The script works for me, though…
2011-09-06T11:49:48  <barnex> hmm
2011-09-06T11:50:03  <barnex> maybe my installation of Opera is broken

2011-09-06T11:51:19  <barnex> and made sure I am running the version I think I am
2011-09-06T11:51:35  <barnex> hmm, won't Selenium::WebDriver.for :opera connect to my local opera?
2011-09-06T11:51:52  <ato> Yes.
2011-09-06T11:52:30  <barnex> I'm trying to do this from some server without graphic environment, but I could copy the repository to my home pc and use bundler to get the same versions of everything

2011-09-06T12:53:52  <adamgoucher> the stalemate right now as you put it is to figure out how to programatically restore vm snapshots. its not a hard problem to solve, but a problem.
2011-09-06T12:54:06  <krosenvold_> Yup; key word being "vm" ;)

2011-09-06T12:54:16  <krosenvold_> Is the hosting expensive ?
2011-09-06T12:54:38  <adamgoucher> the rest of the problems are just money. (new/more hardware, visual studio)
2011-09-06T12:54:59  <adamgoucher> i dont think so. i think openqa gets a hefty discount being open source
2011-09-06T12:55:09  <krosenvold_> Hmpf, I suppose the MS/IE stack has a totally specific set of needs
2011-09-06T12:55:11  <adamgoucher> patrick knows those details
