2011-05-10T01:21:49  <nd_> I'm having problems running selenium 2.0b3 with google chrome on os x: It starts up as '*googlechrome' but times out while the site looks loaded… but I noticed that a folder hierachie is created where I start the process: "/var/folders/… but the folder is literately named `"´ and not quoted… I'd consider this a bug

2011-05-10T03:08:18  <simonstewart> I see that Lars Erik has been roped into our emails
2011-05-10T03:08:26  <ato> Indeed.
2011-05-10T03:08:29  <ato> Speaking of which.
2011-05-10T03:08:30  <simonstewart> Glad that I didn't write anything controversial :)
2011-05-10T03:08:49  <ato> Stuk and I was thinking about just putting the OperaDriver JAR itself in the repo, would that be an option?
2011-05-10T03:09:03  <simonstewart> Totally
2011-05-10T03:09:40  <ato> I'm slightly worried that it will prevent us from hooking on to some things that might not be in selenium-common (or the nodeps jar), but I haven't investigated.
2011-05-10T03:09:57  <simonstewart> Which things are you worried about?
2011-05-10T03:10:19  <Stuk> I like this as OperaDriver is in the repo and should work out of the box, but the code is moved out, which you're trying to do simon :)
2011-05-10T03:10:28  <simonstewart> :)
2011-05-10T03:10:35  <simonstewart> One day, all this will be fields
2011-05-10T03:11:06  <ato> We evaluated the different options.  The problem about putting the actual code in there is that people might get confused as to where to submit patches or fix stuff.
2011-05-10T03:11:16  <simonstewart> Right
2011-05-10T03:11:33  <ato> And since we want to keep you-know-which-VCS-I'm-talking-about, that might get troublesome.
2011-05-10T03:12:22  <simonstewart> I'll be reopening the VCS conversation at some point

2011-05-10T05:17:42  <shudder> i am facing an issue while working with selenium rc 2b3 together with phpunit
2011-05-10T05:19:06  <shudder> even if selenium rc is running, I am getting "PHPUnit_Framework_Exception: Could not connect to the Selenium RC server." everytime i'm executing a test-case with phpunit

2011-05-10T05:20:30  <shudder> i enabled the debug option on the server, in the last lines there is something like "DEBUG - java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out" which looks like the reason
2011-05-10T05:20:49  <shudder> which part of the code would you like to see?
2011-05-10T05:20:52  <barancev> barancev: make a short piece of code that doesn't work for you, and put it to pastebin
2011-05-10T05:22:51  <shudder> just a sec
2011-05-10T05:27:07  <shudder> that is how my testcase looks like: http://pastebin.com/qUuMiXbe
2011-05-10T05:27:34  *** mbeierl has joined #selenium
2011-05-10T05:27:56  <shudder> according to "ps aux", selenium is active with the following parameters: java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar -port 1234 -debug -browserSideLog
2011-05-10T05:29:19  <simonstewart> Why not -port 4444
2011-05-10T05:29:22  <simonstewart> ?
2011-05-10T05:29:38  <simonstewart> 1234 is a non-standard port, and I don't see you setting it anywhere in that test....
2011-05-10T05:30:12  <shudder> it was just because of testing ... i am facing the same issue with 4444
2011-05-10T05:30:25  <simonstewart> lsof -i:4444
2011-05-10T05:32:14  <shudder> lsof -i:4444 gives no output

2011-05-10T05:32:53  <simonstewart> OK. So it looks like selenium is working and that Firefox started. Which version of Firefox are you using?

2011-05-10T05:36:16  <shudder> yes i did

2011-05-10T05:36:21  <simonstewart> OK
2011-05-10T05:36:32  <simonstewart> Does the same thing happen with an official firefox build?
2011-05-10T05:36:36  <shudder> i have another debian machine running where the same config is fine
2011-05-10T05:36:57  <simonstewart> Same version of iceweasel, or with firefox proper?
2011-05-10T05:37:14  <shudder> to be honest i don't know how to get an official firefox build as I did "apt-get install firefox" and got this iceweasel thing
2011-05-10T05:37:35  <shudder> it is also iceweasel on the other machine
2011-05-10T05:37:41  <simonstewart> You can download one from http://www.mozilla.org

2011-05-10T05:39:02  <shudder> not on that machine, but let me tell you something about the "background" of this machine:
2011-05-10T05:39:42  <shudder> this "server" i am running my tests on is a regular PC that is behind a router. i am accessing it via dyndns
2011-05-10T05:40:17  <shudder> on the router itself there are some portforwarding rules, but of course no for 4444 or similar ... could it be related to this fact or is the whole connection transfered by ssh?
2011-05-10T05:41:01  <simonstewart> There's no ssh involved
2011-05-10T05:41:06  <simonstewart> It may have something to do with that
2011-05-10T05:41:19  <shudder> I am accessing the machine via ssh, that's what i mean
2011-05-10T05:41:30  <shudder> btw, iptables -L looks not that interesting: http://pastebin.com/YiqZXAyG
2011-05-10T05:41:33  <simonstewart> that shouldn't make a difference
2011-05-10T05:41:54  <simonstewart> Well, at least we know that nothing's firewalled on the host machine :)
2011-05-10T05:42:14  <shudder> do we?
2011-05-10T05:42:29  <shudder> ok, i see ;)
2011-05-10T05:42:30  <simonstewart> Or whichever machine you ran iptables on

2011-05-10T05:43:32  <shudder> i was thinking that this portforwarding option in the router could be responsible because I don't have this issue on the other debian machine
2011-05-10T05:43:43  <shudder> as the other debian machine is a regular vServer
2011-05-10T05:43:58  <simonstewart> Is it using the same router?

2011-05-10T05:44:56  <simonstewart> And can you open a browser on the machine you're having problems with and point it at the server?
2011-05-10T05:45:02  <nirvdrum> davehunt: Good catch.
2011-05-10T05:45:18  <shudder> that's possible, because port 80 is getting forwarded

2011-05-10T07:13:11  <kruko> simonstewart: Quick question - What could  be the reason of this (http://pastie.org/1885156) . I'm using remote vm with server and ruby script. the last statement of the login function is a click on a element. I watched the server and it performed the click, the page loaded. but never got back to the client. could it be bad connection?
2011-05-10T07:13:30  <wilhelm_> jarib: I bet 50kr you can't do the same for the scope protocol!

2011-05-10T07:15:03  <simonstewart> It may be that you're using implicit waits, and the page isn't reloading fast enough
2011-05-10T07:15:32  <simonstewart> protobufs are pretty easy to use if you're using a language that they support

2011-05-10T07:28:55  <simonstewart> What's the problem?
2011-05-10T07:29:15  <jimevans> it looks like it's not actually creating the .js file (e.g., get_text_ie.js)
2011-05-10T07:29:28  <jimevans> no errors, just the file doesn't show up in the build directory.
2011-05-10T07:29:43  <jimevans> then of course atoms.h is busted, because the source doesn't exist.

2011-05-10T07:29:55  <jimevans> agreed.
2011-05-10T07:29:59  <simonstewart> Typically it means that the compilation has failed
2011-05-10T07:30:12  <simonstewart> Which means that something nasty has happened to the JS
2011-05-10T07:30:25  <jimevans> let me try on a fresh checkout
2011-05-10T07:30:26  <simonstewart> Have they been modified in any way?
2011-05-10T07:30:29  <simonstewart> k
2011-05-10T07:30:41  <jimevans> no, its a straight 'svn co'
2011-05-10T07:30:49  <simonstewart> Hmmm....
2011-05-10T07:30:53  <simonstewart> Hang on a sec
2011-05-10T07:31:54  <simonstewart> Line 112 of javascript.rb should output the failing part of the build
2011-05-10T07:31:58  <simonstewart> But it doesn't
2011-05-10T07:32:00  <simonstewart> *sigh*
2011-05-10T07:32:28  <jimevans> i don't suppose it could be a python language mismatch could it?
2011-05-10T07:32:44  <jimevans> (isn't the js compiler python?)
2011-05-10T07:32:55  <kruko> guys.. do to you see any problem in running the tests in fullscreen browsers? I mean why should I worry about the surrounding browser interface, when I test the active area.. Besides I would know that my active area is equal the the screen size regarding the specific browser used..
2011-05-10T07:33:10  <simonstewart> Which version of python is he using?
2011-05-10T07:33:20  <jimevans> hold on please caller
2011-05-10T07:34:15  <ato> kruko: We run all our tests in fullscreen mode FWIW.
2011-05-10T07:34:46  <jimevans> he's running 3.2
2011-05-10T07:34:49  <jarib> jimevans: is he using rake instead of go?
2011-05-10T07:35:11  <jimevans> no, using go.
2011-05-10T07:35:47  <kruko> FWIW ?
2011-05-10T07:35:57  <ato> kruko: For what it's worth.
2011-05-10T07:36:04  <simonstewart> Use jython
2011-05-10T07:36:12  <simonstewart> We've never tested it with 3.x
2011-05-10T07:36:42  <jarib> perhaps log=true should print the calcdeps output
2011-05-10T07:36:44  <jimevans> how do i force use of jython?
2011-05-10T07:36:45  <kruko> ato: thanks, do you know how to go to fullscreen with javacript or other webDriver way to do it
2011-05-10T07:37:04  <ato> Hm.  For our browser we simply pass it a command-line argument.
2011-05-10T07:37:07  <ato> -fullscreen.
2011-05-10T07:37:12  <ato> Not sure if that works in other browsers.
2011-05-10T07:37:12  <simonstewart> Other than making sure that Python isn't on the PATH?
2011-05-10T07:37:23  <jimevans> of course I could have him downgrade python too. i know he's not using it for anything other than perf gains for building webdriver.
2011-05-10T07:37:36  <wilhelm_> kruko: Pressing F11 works in most browsers, but that's an unreliable toggle.
2011-05-10T07:37:40  <simonstewart> The latest 2.x should be good
2011-05-10T07:37:41  <kruko> ato: I'm running selenium server, which starts the browsers. Maybe I can pass a command line arg to it? Or I can edit it configs ?
2011-05-10T07:37:58  <jimevans> simonstewart: ok. i'll try jython first, then if that works, downgrade python.
2011-05-10T07:37:58  <ato> Configs might also be a good option.
2011-05-10T07:38:05  <ato> kruko: But again, I have no idea how to do this with Firefox-
2011-05-10T07:38:09  <ato> s/-/.
2011-05-10T07:38:18  <simonstewart> Cool
2011-05-10T07:38:20  <kruko> ato: you're dealing with opera?
2011-05-10T07:38:30  <ato> Yes.
2011-05-10T07:38:44  <kruko> ato: thanks :) is opera getting to the standalone?
2011-05-10T07:39:26  <ato> Yes, it will make its way in pretty soon I hope.
2011-05-10T07:39:57  <ato> Got the go ahead from my boss today, so what remains is to resolve any problems with the unit tests, I suppose.
2011-05-10T07:40:25  <ato> kruko: There is apparently a Firefox plugin that enables fullscreen by default.
2011-05-10T07:41:15  <kruko> ato: great idea I'll check it out :)

2011-05-10T07:44:44  <jimevans> so the moral of the story is, don't use python 3.x :)

2011-05-10T08:37:37  <simonstewart> Gah! Another failing test
2011-05-10T08:37:45  <nirvdrum> Connect directly to one and bypass the grid hub.
2011-05-10T08:37:57  <nirvdrum> At least then we can determine if it's the grid killing the session or not.
2011-05-10T08:38:41  <jqp> ah, i see, so try simply launching one rc and running the test on that

2011-05-10T08:48:29  <rmcauley> And my understanding after skimming the discussion was that the issue with the JSON gem wasn't "oh it won't load" and more like "it fails in bizarre ways."

2011-05-10T11:24:02  <jqp> apparently each new command is represented by an (or gets added to) an SingleEntryAsyncQueue object, and each RC waits for 1800 seconds (i.e., 30 minutes) for more data

2011-05-10T12:30:52  <jarib> jimevans: it doesn't use native events at the moment
2011-05-10T12:30:57  <jarib> it will
2011-05-10T12:31:08  <jarib> but they're non-native events aren't really synthesized - they fire webkit events
2011-05-10T12:31:15  <jimevans> ah. ok.
2011-05-10T12:31:17  <jarib> so they're actually able to implement mouse/keyboard stuff using that.
2011-05-10T12:31:46  <jarib> you'll be able to toggle *real* native events, like in firefox

2011-05-10T16:51:56  <santiycr> hi
2011-05-10T16:51:59  <santiycr> I've been called :)
2011-05-10T16:52:20  <edoceo> Does selenium only browser automate in Java or C# ?
2011-05-10T16:52:42  <santiycr> @Rogi context?
2011-05-10T16:52:57  <edoceo> That is, the phpunit-selenium is not the tool to use to automate browsers like Selenium IDE does or like the other players?
2011-05-10T16:53:26  <santiycr> @sfbrian hi, I don't think that's a problem that happens with ajax elements not being loaded
2011-05-10T16:53:42  <Rogi> santiycr: I hate working with xpath, would rather use css selectors
2011-05-10T16:54:20  <santiycr> @sfbrian seems like you're just trying to run an action while the browser is still navigating
2011-05-10T16:54:27  <santiycr> @Rogi Selenium 1 or 2?
2011-05-10T16:54:37  <Rogi> 2
2011-05-10T16:54:56  <sfbrian> santiycr: it happens when selenium is trying to access the body but it can't because an ajax call is happening
2011-05-10T16:55:06  <sfbrian> document.body is not accessible until the dom is ready
2011-05-10T16:55:24  <santiycr> you can use by.css()
2011-05-10T16:55:48  <santiycr> @sfbrian I don't think that's correct
2011-05-10T16:55:54  <santiycr> once the browser fully loaded, the dom is ready
2011-05-10T16:56:06  <santiycr> even if further ajax requests are made, the dom should still be available
2011-05-10T16:56:11  <santiycr> and fully functional

2011-05-10T17:02:26  <santiycr> Rogi: you may wanna keep it to the standards, that is not sizzle magic
2011-05-10T17:03:06  <santiycr> Rogi: selenium currently only uses sizzle for css selectors when it can't leverage the browser's implementation (IE and old browsers)
2011-05-10T17:03:24  <Rogi> :nth() should work?
2011-05-10T17:03:27  <santiycr> which means that if you use things like :nth, you'll get inconsistent results depending on what you use
2011-05-10T17:03:32  <santiycr> nope :)

2011-05-10T17:16:08  <santiycr> sfbrian: you may wanna check out my script ;)
2011-05-10T17:16:17  <sfbrian> what script
2011-05-10T17:16:20  <santiycr> https://github.com/santiycr/cssify
2011-05-10T17:16:24  <santiycr> does it for you automatically
2011-05-10T17:16:25  <santiycr> ;)
2011-05-10T17:16:26  <sfbrian> dude
2011-05-10T17:16:32  <sfbrian> you rule
2011-05-10T17:16:36  <sfbrian> how well does it work?
2011-05-10T17:16:45  <santiycr> heh, good question
2011-05-10T17:16:59  <santiycr> it's not super duper smart, I think it's like 20 lines of code
2011-05-10T17:17:12  <santiycr> but does a pretty decent job with the basics
2011-05-10T17:17:25  <sfbrian> we have lots of //a[text()='Link Text']
2011-05-10T17:17:39  <santiycr> it will do those without problems
2011-05-10T17:17:57  <sfbrian> how do you match on full text
2011-05-10T17:18:00  <sfbrian> or do you use contains()
2011-05-10T17:18:11  <santiycr> just use contains all the time
2011-05-10T17:18:19  <sfbrian> ah
2011-05-10T17:18:20  <santiycr> I see how it can be bad
2011-05-10T17:18:24  <santiycr> hm
2011-05-10T17:18:36  <santiycr> probably usign selenium's link= locator would be faster
2011-05-10T17:18:43  <santiycr> link=Link Text
2011-05-10T17:18:47  <sfbrian> does link= have problems in IE?
2011-05-10T17:19:37  <santiycr> sfbrian: I'd be surprised if it does, as it uses the browser's native dom to find it
2011-05-10T17:19:46  <sfbrian> ah, nice
2011-05-10T17:19:54  <santiycr> marlena_: send me the link, interested for sure
2011-05-10T17:20:08  <sfbrian> well at least we have all our locators in one file, which is a good step 1
2011-05-10T17:20:16  <marlena_> This is about the tag:  http://html5doctor.com/the-hgroup-element/
2011-05-10T17:20:23  <sfbrian> can't make your talk tomorrow but I figure it's similar to the one you did at seconf
2011-05-10T17:20:39  <marlena_> wondering if it's dev-misuse-of.
2011-05-10T17:21:01  <santiycr> marlena_: don't think the tag would make any difference would love to see a failing test
2011-05-10T17:21:25  <santiycr> sfbrian: I''ve added some more shbang, as I had more time this time
2011-05-10T17:21:50  <santiycr> plus I'm adding a "tools" part in which I show off stuff like cssify and the new selenium ide that does css for you
2011-05-10T17:22:10  <sfbrian> nice
2011-05-10T17:22:16  <marlena_> I wrote 3 tests with locators before, inside and after the tag.  Dave H. suggested I post in selenium-developers forum.
2011-05-10T17:22:44  <santiycr> makes sense
2011-05-10T17:22:53  <sfbrian> in my experience I've found that tools that produce xpath for you is always really bad
2011-05-10T17:22:56  <sfbrian> not sure about css
2011-05-10T17:23:02  <sfbrian> i've been using firepath and it's not bad
2011-05-10T17:23:31  <Rogi> xpath should die in a fire
2011-05-10T17:23:57  <sfbrian> haha
2011-05-10T17:24:09  <sfbrian> Rogi: why?
2011-05-10T17:24:34  <sfbrian> besides the obvious IE support answer
2011-05-10T17:24:35  <santiycr> I tried to do a better job with css guessing in Selenium IDE, but reality is that the script will never be as good as a person when it comes to finding the most reliable locator for an element
2011-05-10T17:24:56  <santiycr> also, xpath is fucking unreadable
2011-05-10T17:25:12  <marlena_> santiycr: +1
2011-05-10T17:25:19  <sfbrian> after working with it for 4 years I can read it just fine :)
2011-05-10T17:25:27  <santiycr> but the problem is not xpath, the problem is xml...
2011-05-10T17:25:36  <santiycr> sfbrian: sorry to hear that
2011-05-10T17:25:40  <sfbrian> haha
2011-05-10T17:25:40  <santiycr> XD
2011-05-10T17:25:47  <sfbrian> nobody opened my world to css
2011-05-10T17:25:55  <sfbrian> blame thoughtworks
2011-05-10T17:26:34  <sfbrian> their contractor taught us to use xpath back when we were all learning selenium and using Twist *ack*
2011-05-10T17:27:46  <santiycr> well, reality is that css is not meant to do the same stuff that xpath does
2011-05-10T17:27:56  <santiycr> xpath provides full tree navigation functionality
2011-05-10T17:28:09  <sfbrian> so far I've found xpath to be more powerful vs css
2011-05-10T17:28:17  <sfbrian> it's unfortunate that IE doesn't work well with it
2011-05-10T17:28:19  <santiycr> while css is just meant to be used to style html
2011-05-10T17:28:35  <sfbrian> but css also forces your developers to write ids for everything
2011-05-10T17:28:44  <sfbrian> which can be a good thing if you can get them to do it
2011-05-10T17:28:52  <santiycr> there's only one think I found I couldn't do with css that I can with xpath
2011-05-10T17:28:59  <santiycr> that is bottom up navigation
2011-05-10T17:29:13  <sfbrian> and matching on full text
2011-05-10T17:29:18  <santiycr> s/think/thing
2011-05-10T17:29:34  <santiycr> sfbrian: hm, true
2011-05-10T17:29:42  <sfbrian> even though this might work: http://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/362/a-way-to-match-on-text-using-css-locators
2011-05-10T17:29:42  <santiycr> never considered that one really important
2011-05-10T17:29:45  <sfbrian> just checked my question
2011-05-10T17:30:21  <sfbrian> example, 2 links, one is called Administer and the other called Admin
2011-05-10T17:30:33  <sfbrian> and you want to click Admin (just using css locators)
2011-05-10T17:30:40  <sfbrian> if you do contains it finds both
2011-05-10T17:30:47  <sfbrian> and clicks the first one
2011-05-10T17:31:27  <santiycr> sfbrian: so none of those solutions worked, huh?
2011-05-10T17:31:47  <sfbrian> haven't tried the newest one yet: css=div:contains(“^ab$”)
2011-05-10T17:32:08  <santiycr> I'd be surprised if that one works, never heard of contains allowing you to use regex
2011-05-10T17:32:31  <santiycr> I think that dude is just throwing every idea he can come up with
2011-05-10T17:33:47  <sfbrian> haha
2011-05-10T17:34:36  <santiycr> I guess one that would work in your particular case would be  a:contains(Adm):not(:contains(Administer))
2011-05-10T17:34:39  <santiycr> but is lame
2011-05-10T17:34:48  <santiycr> pretty lame
2011-05-10T17:35:18  <sfbrian> haha yeah
2011-05-10T17:35:30  <sfbrian> i guess in those cases link= is the way to go
2011-05-10T17:35:39  <sfbrian> whoa
2011-05-10T17:35:44  <sfbrian> his solution worked?
2011-05-10T17:35:47  <sfbrian> don't believe it
2011-05-10T17:36:47  <santiycr> woah!
2011-05-10T17:36:50  <sfbrian> yup, it worked
2011-05-10T17:36:57  <santiycr> holy shit
2011-05-10T17:37:08  <sfbrian> "css=a:contains('^Admin$')"
2011-05-10T17:37:43  <sfbrian> that is really surprising
2011-05-10T17:37:45  <Rogi> santiycr: why not just use sizzle by default
2011-05-10T17:38:01  <Rogi> let it handle portability
2011-05-10T17:38:33  <Rogi> sfbrian: regular expressions are surprising?
2011-05-10T17:39:02  <sfbrian> Rogi: using regex within css
2011-05-10T17:39:30  *** marlena_ has quit IRC
2011-05-10T17:40:42  <santiycr> sfbrian: I think that's a jquery goodie
2011-05-10T17:40:59  <santiycr> Rogi: it's an implementation limitation
2011-05-10T17:41:23  <sfbrian> santiycr: it might be a good one to add to your guide
2011-05-10T17:41:33  <santiycr> Rogi: Selenium 2 doesn't have a place where to inject js and keep it available
2011-05-10T17:42:00  <santiycr> Rogi: which means that if the browser window navigates, you need to inject sizzle again if you want to use it
2011-05-10T17:42:54  <santiycr> Rogi: in IE, they send the whole sizzle code over the wire every time they want to use a css selector, which is pretty slow
2011-05-10T17:43:07  <santiycr> but better than no css selector at all, I guess
2011-05-10T17:43:14  <santiycr> sfbrian: I'm adding it to my script right now
2011-05-10T17:43:16  <santiycr> definitely
2011-05-10T17:43:20  <sfbrian> nice
2011-05-10T17:43:48  <Rogi> IE should be caching it after first hit though
2011-05-10T17:45:33  <santiycr> sfbrian: just fixed and pushed, the new version should work :)
2011-05-10T17:45:43  <ivog> any grid 2.0 user here?
2011-05-10T17:45:50  *** Spanktar has quit IRC
2011-05-10T17:46:19  <santiycr> Rogi: yup, still not a cost that is worth paying for browsers that already provide you a native css selecting engine
2011-05-10T17:46:23  <sfbrian> santiycr: woot!
2011-05-10T17:46:32  <sfbrian> I'll try it out and let you know how it works
2011-05-10T17:46:41  <santiycr> sfbrian: sounds good :)
2011-05-10T17:46:49  <sfbrian> santiycr: taking off, thanks for the help
2011-05-10T17:47:07  <santiycr> sfbrian: np!
