2011-06-15T02:43:03  <barancev> __mike: driver.findElement(By.name("submit")).click();
2011-06-15T02:43:18  <__mike> You can but it doesn't work properly in the example I tested.
2011-06-15T02:43:49  <barancev> __mike: can you explainn in more details what is not working as expected?
2011-06-15T02:44:02  <__mike> Actions builder = new Actions( driver ); build.sendKeys( driver.findElement( By.name("q") ), "Cheese!" ).click( driver.findElement( By.name("btnG") ) );
2011-06-15T02:44:17  <__mike> Doing this on Google does different behaviour in FF3 and IE8
2011-06-15T02:45:10  <__mike> On IE8 the submit button is clicked as expected. On firefox3 the instant search starts loading a new page, you can see Selenium scrolling up the list and then when it clicks it just dismisses the dropdown from instant search but does not actually search the page as it does in IE
2011-06-15T02:46:22  <__mike> Actually it doesn't even dismiss the dropdown from instant search.

2011-06-15T03:00:47  <simonstewart> I'm hoping to chat to IE devs a little sooner than September
2011-06-15T03:01:35  <simonstewart> Hopefully I'll be meeting one of the developer evangelists in early July
2011-06-15T03:01:59  <adamgoucher> that, in theory, would be less $$ as well
2011-06-15T03:02:10  <simonstewart> True

2011-06-15T03:04:07  <barancev> __mike: thanks!
2011-06-15T03:04:17  <__mike> barancev: Could you try that same code with Chrome ? On my machine it will throw an exception saying an element is not visible when it in fact is. The code seems to work fine in IE though
2011-06-15T03:05:18  <barancev> __mike: yes, I've got the same exception
2011-06-15T03:05:40  <__mike> Is that a bug ?
2011-06-15T03:06:12  <adamgoucher> nativewebdriver is cool, but driving the apps is not the weak point of android testing; its the under-the-cover unit testing that is weak
2011-06-15T03:07:13  <barancev> __mike: at least it is an issue :)
2011-06-15T03:08:52  <adamgoucher> simonstewart: that conference in kl does indeed look nice
2011-06-15T03:09:02  <simonstewart> Yup
2011-06-15T03:09:11  <simonstewart> Really looking forward to it

2011-06-15T03:09:32  <simonstewart> I think I should be putting more effort into my presentations that I do right now
2011-06-15T03:09:55  <__mike> barancev: I just re-ran the test  a few times. Sometimes the exception is thrown, sometimes not. I think it's more of an issue with google's instant search maybe when it relocates the search button rather than a bug with ChromeDriver

2011-06-15T03:13:31  <__mike> if i'm correct it's down to the loading speed. i think the current behaviour is okay. if the user wants to avoid it he/she should use webdriverwait until findElement( By.name("btnG") ) returns a proper result

2011-06-15T03:26:04  <barancev> __mike: nevertheless, it does not explain why dropdown list is not removed after click in FF and Chrome
2011-06-15T03:27:08  <barancev> (or at least in FF, if wait resolves this issue in Chrome)

2011-06-15T04:44:59  <__mike> i want something where i can set it for calling it not with the grid as well
2011-06-15T04:45:32  <__mike> but i guess i can make that so it's another constructor
2011-06-15T04:47:28  *** miker2 has joined #selenium
2011-06-15T04:49:58  <freynaud> __mike: i'm not sure I understand what's you're trying to do
2011-06-15T04:50:34  <freynaud> you want it without grid in between the test and the server ?
2011-06-15T04:50:58  <__mike> so you know how i implemented another webdriver which extended chromedriver ? i want to add a way the user can specify what size the client window will be. right now it's hardcoded. currently how it's done is that i'm adding to the constructor a commons.exec call to a native exe which does the resizing
2011-06-15T04:51:58  <__mike> i want the x/y to not be hardcoded so ideally have the user pass it. i think maybe it requires changes in 2 places. another constructor allowing x/y to be passed in for when the webdriver is created locally and also overriding like you have done for remotewebdriver for when my custom webdriver is invoked over the grid
2011-06-15T04:53:05  <freynaud> locally can always have a capability as a param, you don't need  grid for that
2011-06-15T04:53:35  <freynaud> in your MikeDriver, you can have a if capability.getCapability("x") kind of thing
2011-06-15T04:54:23  <freynaud> when you're running locally, you just need to keep in mind that it's best match logic
2011-06-15T04:54:34  <freynaud> if chrome isn't there, you might end up using firefox
2011-06-15T04:54:50  <freynaud> and the capabilities x / y will be ignored in that case
2011-06-15T04:55:07  <__mike> yeap i think that's okay. that's how selenium works
2011-06-15T04:55:29  <__mike> so actually if i do this capabilities stuff in mikedriver then that should also take care of when it's done over the grid ?
2011-06-15T04:55:36  <__mike> which means i'm not required to override beforesession ?
2011-06-15T04:56:30  <__mike> i'm not sure how i can get the capability when inside the webdriver class though. is that only for the case when it's called with the capabilities constructor ?
2011-06-15T04:57:16  <__mike> oh wait. all the constructors call the capabilities one eventually

2011-06-15T05:49:40  <jimevans> Hi!
2011-06-15T05:49:47  <simonstewart> After my tweet today an MS evangelist sent me an email
2011-06-15T05:49:57  <simonstewart> I'll be having a chat with them in a week or two

2011-06-15T05:50:00  <AutomatedTester> jrock20041: currently I dont think there is a way to do that
2011-06-15T05:50:08  <simonstewart> Hopefully that'll help get the ball rolling a little
2011-06-15T05:50:12  <jimevans> Groovy.

2011-06-15T05:52:50  <simonstewart> It should be starting with a clean profile
2011-06-15T05:53:06  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: it requires me to send an email. Is that correct?
2011-06-15T05:53:21  <simonstewart> yeah
2011-06-15T05:53:24  <jrock20041> Oh so unlike firefox it does start with an empty profile
2011-06-15T05:53:52  <simonstewart> they both should be starting with an empty profile
2011-06-15T05:53:53  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: done

2011-06-15T06:07:10  <doc_tuna> hi
2011-06-15T06:07:39  <doc_tuna> am i right that there's two ways to do many things?
2011-06-15T06:07:57  <doc_tuna> either with a Selenium object or a WebDriver object?
2011-06-15T06:08:36  <simonstewart> There's two APIs
2011-06-15T06:08:40  <doc_tuna> I am trying to figure out best practice for someone just starting out
2011-06-15T06:08:43  <simonstewart> The older Selenium ones and the newer WebDriver ones
2011-06-15T06:08:50  <simonstewart> Use the WebDriver APIs
2011-06-15T06:09:03  <simonstewart> and take a look at the docs on http://seleniumhq.org
2011-06-15T06:09:05  <doc_tuna> ok but it also seems like WebDriver is not as mature
2011-06-15T06:09:15  <doc_tuna> like I couldn't find a way to delete a cookie with the webdriver api
2011-06-15T06:09:29  <simonstewart> driver.manage() will lead you in the right direction
2011-06-15T06:09:41  <doc_tuna> ok I'll look into that

2011-06-15T06:25:37  <RossPatterson> simonstewart: I think doc_tuna is a good example of your point in AOSA: "The downside of the decision to expose capabilities in this way is that until someone knows that a particular interface exists they may not realize that WebDriver supports that type of functionality; there's a loss of explorability in the API."

2011-06-15T07:05:49  <rpk> yeah, remember like the first couple of days, I was annoyed that getText didn't perform as I wanted it to.
2011-06-15T07:06:01  <__mike> simonstewart. doesn't that stuff sort clash with the new paradigm you're going for with actions and everything ?
2011-06-15T07:06:28  <rpk> And it devolved into a discussion of adding a forms class to provide utility methods / type safety for forms operations

2011-06-15T07:07:11  <simonstewart> rpk: I'm aiming at keeping the core API as small as possible
2011-06-15T07:07:24  <simonstewart> at some point, I should really spin out the support classes to a separate project

2011-06-15T07:07:38  <simonstewart> Ahhh....
2011-06-15T07:07:47  <simonstewart> I view them as a mechanism for reducing duplication
2011-06-15T07:07:53  <rpk> simonstewart: yes, I'm aware :)  though if you do branch out to a separate project, make it easy to get the whole thing at least
2011-06-15T07:08:00  <simonstewart> Will do
2011-06-15T07:08:03  <simonstewart> For sure
2011-06-15T07:08:31  <jimevans> So RC3 tomorrow?
2011-06-15T07:08:38  <simonstewart> That's the plan
2011-06-15T07:08:51  <__mike> btw is there something which is similar to my waitAndClick( driver, by, text ) which waits does the same as implicitwait but checks all bys which contain a certain text ? or is that too specific to be generically useful ?
2011-06-15T07:08:53  <jimevans> Hmm
2011-06-15T07:08:59  <simonstewart> hmm?

2011-06-15T07:09:12  <simonstewart> __mike: that's a little specific

2011-06-15T07:10:04  <rpk> __mike: webdriverwait will handle that use case for you, just with some setup
2011-06-15T07:10:22  <__mike> yep that's exactly how i'm doing it currently: http://pastebin.com/EUj7GV9a
2011-06-15T07:10:29  <__mike> i'm not sure if i'm using it correctly but it works..
2011-06-15T07:10:58  <simonstewart> That looks reasonable
2011-06-15T07:11:04  <__mike> it's very useful because the page i'm testing is made in sencha touch where buttons have same classes and styles. and ids are not reliable
2011-06-15T07:11:15  <simonstewart> Though I'd be tempted to break out the function that does the check from the wait
2011-06-15T07:11:16  <jimevans> I think so, but need to double-check
2011-06-15T07:11:22  <simonstewart> and have a field called "longWait" or some-such
2011-06-15T07:11:29  <rpk> oh god, Sencha Touch.  Its like they took the extjs model and made it worse

2011-06-15T07:11:38  <__mike> lmao
2011-06-15T07:12:02  <RossPatterson> My dev team is headed towards ExtJS.  :-(
2011-06-15T07:12:12  <__mike> simonstewart : you mean break into separate methods ?
2011-06-15T07:12:17  <rpk> Want to have multiple cards, or elements on the page that doesn't take up 100% of the viewspace?  Nope!  can't have that.
2011-06-15T07:12:46  <__mike> sencha touch is nice. i think they did a great job.. i've seen some really slick stuff in-house with it
2011-06-15T07:13:10  <rpk> __mike: are the uis done entirely in Sencha?
2011-06-15T07:13:37  <__mike> yep, think so. but for some stuff like huge grids they're not doing it in sencha because that doesn't handle well on devices
2011-06-15T07:13:51  <rpk> the problem really comes when you don't want to use Sencha only, or want to embed a sencha component in a page, or want to do something html makes easy, but sencha doesn't because of the card viewmodel
2011-06-15T07:14:05  <doc_tuna> is there a url which has API docs for the python bindings?
2011-06-15T07:14:20  <doc_tuna> or should I just refer to the javadocs and assume things work the same

2011-06-15T07:18:52  <simonstewart> which is why eranm is on it
2011-06-15T07:18:56  <barancev> good
2011-06-15T07:19:26  <ssims> I have a question, how do you specify a specific version of a browser with webdriver in ruby.     driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for(:remote, :url => "http://myhub:4444/wd/hub", :desired_capabilities => Selenium::WebDriver::Remote::Capabilities.internet_explorer)
2011-06-15T07:19:42  <ssims> I want to specify IE 7 or 8.  Feel free to point me to a doc.
2011-06-15T07:19:55  <samitbadle> adamgoucher: have you finished the page on first load stuff? If not, I will take it up as well.
2011-06-15T07:19:59  <eranm> barancev, can you work around the issue by delaying sendKeys a bit or by clicking the body first?
2011-06-15T07:20:01  <simonstewart> freynaud: ^^
2011-06-15T07:20:08  <simonstewart> eranm: it's a race
2011-06-15T07:20:17  <eranm> ok
2011-06-15T07:20:55  <adamgoucher> samitbadle: tackling it tomorrow
2011-06-15T07:21:01  <doc_tuna> ssims: I don't think there is a way to specify the version, it uses the default ie install
2011-06-15T07:21:12  <freynaud> ssims: with ruby I'm not sure, but you need 2 part
2011-06-15T07:21:12  <doc_tuna> I was told to run several vms with different versions of IE
2011-06-15T07:21:17  <rpk> __mike: want to know how to target your docs efforts?  just sit in the channel, and watch people ask the same question over and over again (e.g. how to specify browser, versoin, execution model for grid), and then document those things in an easy to find place
2011-06-15T07:21:26  <freynaud> 1- you need to register IE properly on the grid
2011-06-15T07:21:42  <ssims> I am using grid 2 with the RC2 server standalone jar
2011-06-15T07:21:46  <freynaud> browserName=internet explorer,version=8
2011-06-15T07:21:52  *** |izzie has joined #selenium
2011-06-15T07:21:58  <ssims> thank you!
2011-06-15T07:22:01  <freynaud> if you don't specify the version, grid won't kno it
2011-06-15T07:22:08  <doc_tuna> it's possible to specify version?
2011-06-15T07:22:16  <freynaud> you can check what the hub knows by mouve hover the icon
2011-06-15T07:22:22  <doc_tuna> so I can have multiple IEs on one box?
2011-06-15T07:22:39  <doc_tuna> people in users group said this wasn't doable
2011-06-15T07:22:43  <freynaud> then on the client side, you need to produce a desiredcapability containing everything you request. So ie + version for you
2011-06-15T07:22:58  <__mike> rpk: i think an overview is necessary of how different components fit together. desiredcapabilities, remotewebdriver, client language bindings, server stuff, grid. then simple examples of common uses with some text explaining what is going on. what is on the site is good in terms of quality but it's just not up to date
2011-06-15T07:23:14  <barancev> eranm: no, timeout does not help
2011-06-15T07:23:23  <__mike> and i think it's difficult to understand the differences between ide, rc and webdriver which is something that confused me at the start for a while
2011-06-15T07:23:26  <andytinkham> doc_tuna: I think where your confusion is coming in is the grid vs. multiple installs thing
2011-06-15T07:23:30  <barancev> eranm: yes, if you click before sendKeys - all is OK
2011-06-15T07:23:34  <jimevans> doc_tuna: No. No. A thousand times, no. 1 IE install per OS.
2011-06-15T07:23:46  <rpk> __mike: do me a favor, and make sure you note that the grid itself does not parallelize incoming requests, that the testrunner is responsible for not blocking on results
2011-06-15T07:24:01  <samitbadle> adamgoucher: If you don't mind, I will take care of it. It will take me less than 10 mins.
2011-06-15T07:24:03  <andytinkham> doc_tuna: My presumption is that ssims is pointing to different machines in his grid for each version, not having them installed locally on one machine
2011-06-15T07:24:22  <barancev> eranm: you may click to body, any element, just to get focus out of addressbar
2011-06-15T07:24:31  <doc_tuna> andytinkham: ah ok, so where he's specifying the version it would actually select a different machine
2011-06-15T07:24:41  <eranm> barancev, I see.
2011-06-15T07:24:55  <andytinkham> doc_tuna: Yep, that's what I'm thinking
2011-06-15T07:24:58  <barancev> so, it's not a race
2011-06-15T07:25:00  <doc_tuna> jimevans: sorry ;)
2011-06-15T07:25:10  <adamgoucher> samitbadle: sure; and blog it and add it to the tutorial
2011-06-15T07:25:20  <jimevans> No problem at all.
2011-06-15T07:26:01  <__mike> rpk: that kinda stuff should be documented and if it's a common case then some POC code written which shows how to parallelise. for example i do so by using a fixedthreadpool. however that's separate
2011-06-15T07:26:14  <andytinkham> doc_tuna: IE installs upgrade common components in non-user configurable locations so even if you somehow get multiple IE executables, you're not really getting the older versions any longer, just some facsimile that doesn't really tell you anything about your app's capabilties
2011-06-15T07:26:29  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-06-15T07:27:42  <rpk> __mike: the docs don't currently cover it because its not really the responsibility of Selenium (and everyone uses a different testing framework with different parallelization options), and should be fairly obvious.  Unfortunately, people tend to see "parallel execution" and don't realize that sending 1000 junit testcases in sequentially isn't parallelized 'automatically'

2011-06-15T07:33:57  <freynaud> first thing that people usually don't get is that selenium isn't a testing framework. It helps, but you still need a framework behing, and you need to understand it
2011-06-15T07:33:58  <samitbadle> adamgoucher: Done. Opens the release notes on the first run.

2011-06-15T10:46:05  <jarib> simonstewart: a bit concerned about this setSelected() vs <select multiple> thing
2011-06-15T10:46:32  <rpk> i thought setSelected was going away?
2011-06-15T10:46:36  <jarib> it is
2011-06-15T10:46:44  <jarib> that's the problem
2011-06-15T10:47:47  <jarib> the only alternative if you want to select more than one element in a multiple select list is the interactions API, which isn't working across all browsers/platforms at the moment
2011-06-15T10:47:57  <rpk> :(
2011-06-15T10:48:20  <jarib> so basically setSelected is being deprecated with no real replacement for this use case
2011-06-15T10:48:27  <jarib> which is what i'd like to fix
2011-06-15T10:48:56  <jarib> simonstewart: i'll create a java test
2011-06-15T10:49:17  <rpk> is the interactions api going to be baked in time for 2.0 final?
2011-06-15T10:50:10  <rpk> actually, what in interactions am I supposed to be using for multiple select?
2011-06-15T10:50:53  <rpk> build out that forms class separate from core, and provide this as utility methods :P
2011-06-15T10:51:47  <jarib> rpk: there's already a Select class in the support API
2011-06-15T10:51:50  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-06-15T10:52:03  <jarib> rpk: the interactions API allows you to e.g. hold down shift while clicking elements
2011-06-15T10:52:18  <jarib> (or more likely, control)
2011-06-15T10:52:53  <rpk> oh, I would need to use say, KeyDownAction
2011-06-15T10:54:38  <RossPatterson> jarib: That's kinda smelly.  If the API is "hold the control key while clicking on the separate choices", the assumption is that the browser actually works that way.  For arguments sake, what if Opera decides that alt+click is the right human UI action for that behavior?
2011-06-15T10:55:37  <jarib> RossPatterson: that's why we'll have Keys.SINGLE_SELECT
2011-06-15T10:55:37  <tunabum> ... also ctrl click on a mac is a right click
2011-06-15T10:55:47  <jarib> RossPatterson: what would you suggest?
2011-06-15T10:55:55  <jarib> not deprecating setSelected()?
2011-06-15T10:56:03  <RossPatterson> Yup, now that I think about it.
2011-06-15T10:56:46  <RossPatterson> I get the WebDriver "do what the user does" API mantra, but I think this may be a bridge too far.
2011-06-15T10:57:10  <jarib> you could certainly make that argument
2011-06-15T10:58:06  <jarib> i'm not sure what i think
2011-06-15T10:58:24  <wilhelm> Not if you're testing the browser itself. Then you literally need to do what the user does.
2011-06-15T10:58:59  <RossPatterson> Coming at it from a dofferent angle, what if "click on the button" was implemented by the ClickLeftButton() method.  I use a left-handed mouse - I click with the right button.  Handedness should not be concern for the program using the WebDriver API.
2011-06-15T10:59:06  <RossPatterson> s/doff/diff/
2011-06-15T10:59:33  <jarib> RossPatterson: certainly it *can* be taken too far, i'm not sure we're there yet though
2011-06-15T10:59:58  <rpk> yes, but your mouse is remapping the left click effect for you
2011-06-15T11:00:20  <rpk> I think the best approach would be to abstract over browser specific implementation details as much as possible, wouldn't it?
2011-06-15T11:00:47  <RossPatterson> rpk: So, as tunabum points out, what if I'm on a single-button-mouse platform?
2011-06-15T11:01:00  <RossPatterson> rpk: Yes, that's my point.
2011-06-15T11:01:07  <rpk> then that platform probably has a mechanism for right click effects
2011-06-15T11:01:11  <rpk> such as click and hold
2011-06-15T11:01:31  <rpk> so calling into 'right click' on that platform should find the implementation calling click and hold
2011-06-15T11:02:05  <rpk> as an abstraction, you standardize upon what is agnostic as possible, or failing that, where the majority of the OS population lies
2011-06-15T11:03:05  <RossPatterson> rpk: And what we're discussing politely here is what an idealized browser looks like and how much difference between it and the real browsers WebDriver should hide.  I'm suggesting that "ctrl-click" isn't as universal as some folks might think, and shouldn't be part of the idealized browser UI.
2011-06-15T11:03:32  <rpk> and I agreed?  politely?
2011-06-15T11:03:36  <RossPatterson> LOL

2011-06-15T11:34:09  <jrock20041> is there a method that can find all id or css elements attributes on the current page?
2011-06-15T11:35:44  <jarib> jrock20041: sort of. why though? what's the high-level goal?
2011-06-15T11:35:55  <jarib> we may know a better way to achieve it
2011-06-15T11:37:01  <jrock20041> jarib: Lets say I have automation script that a checkout in a store. I now move to another store where element attributes change. Instead of manually finding them I want to write something to harvest the store and at the end have a document of them so I then can update accordingly
2011-06-15T11:37:34  <jrock20041> ex. search box now has an id of searchbox instead of search
2011-06-15T11:38:52  <jarib> jrock20041: so this is limited to form elements?
2011-06-15T11:39:28  <jrock20041> well could be any html element really
2011-06-15T11:39:44  <jrock20041> could be an a,li,select

2011-06-15T11:58:08  <RossPatterson> Yes.  Acutally most tests take 35-45 seconds, but we have a few monsters that skew the average.
2011-06-15T11:58:41  <jarib> and how many do you run in parallel?
2011-06-15T11:59:00  <jrock20041> I think he means parallel threading
2011-06-15T11:59:53  <RossPatterson> We use JetBrains' TeamCity CI system, and we divide the tests arbitrarily into jobs of as close to 30 minutes as possible.  Right now, we run 14 jobs for the full suite, and at least 5 at a time.
2011-06-15T12:00:13  <jrock20041> I was wrong sorry
2011-06-15T12:00:38  <RossPatterson> Each job has a fully-isolated stack - test scripts, Selenium, UI, web tier, app tier, DB.

2011-06-15T12:02:05  *** AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
2011-06-15T12:02:12  <jarib> huh, so ~5 browsers max at any given time?
2011-06-15T12:02:25  <jarib> i guess "how long does the full build take" is what i'm asking
2011-06-15T12:03:35  *** jcake has quit IRC
2011-06-15T12:04:47  <RossPatterson> Start to finish, the most recent build took 1 hour 24 minutes.
2011-06-15T12:05:19  <RossPatterson> That's longer than we like, but we need to refactor one really large test fixture so we can split it into at least 3 jobs.
2011-06-15T12:05:35  <RossPatterson> Just not a high priority right now :-)
2011-06-15T12:06:05  <jarib> ah, i see
2011-06-15T12:07:13  <jarib> how many developers work on the code?
2011-06-15T12:07:42  <RossPatterson> On the test code, 4.

2011-06-15T12:08:08  <RossPatterson> Product is a different story.
2011-06-15T12:08:46  <RossPatterson> Sorta.  We use random values as often as possible, either really random or randomly selected from known, existing data.

2011-06-15T12:12:13  <lawcab> just updated from 2.0b3 to 2.0rc2
2011-06-15T12:12:50  <jtal> it looks like its a commonly asked question on message boards so I'm guessing selenium doesnt do this
2011-06-15T12:12:53  <RossPatterson> jta: So, you're on a Linux machine, and you want the PID of the Selenium server?  Sounds like a quick "ps -somethingorother | grep selenium-server"
2011-06-15T12:13:21  <jtal> yeah, I know I can do that, or use $!
2011-06-15T12:13:37  <jtal> just wondering if there was a cleaner way. servers often have an option to store the pid somewhere
2011-06-15T12:13:45  <RossPatterson> jta: It may be a common question, but I've never heard it, and Selenium doesn't do it that I know of.
2011-06-15T12:13:46  <lawcab> and i am using an IEdriver
2011-06-15T12:13:52  <jtal> ok
2011-06-15T12:14:03  <simonstewart> lawcab: go on
2011-06-15T12:14:21  <lawcab> before driver.findElement(By.id("ajaxSignOn")).click();
2011-06-15T12:14:29  <lawcab> it works on 2.0b3
2011-06-15T12:14:38  <RossPatterson> jtal: On Linux systems, that's often done by the startup script that launches the server (e.g., in /etc/init/...)
2011-06-15T12:14:39  <lawcab> and it does not work on 2.0rc2
2011-06-15T12:14:56  <lawcab> and it works on firefox driver on both selenium version
2011-06-15T12:15:01  <simonstewart> ok
2011-06-15T12:15:07  <simonstewart> Is it a timing issue?
2011-06-15T12:15:31  <lawcab> i can try to put a wait i guess
2011-06-15T12:15:57  <simonstewart> Just to see if it makes a difference
2011-06-15T12:16:11  <simonstewart> If it does: great. If it doesn't we can start exploring other options
2011-06-15T12:18:11  <lawcab> i tried to sleep for 2 secs and it did not do anything
2011-06-15T12:18:16  <lawcab> I went up to 5 still nothing
2011-06-15T12:18:28  <lawcab> I even tried to go on debug mode
2011-06-15T12:18:30  <simonstewart> OK. Is anything on that page getting a click?
2011-06-15T12:18:37  <lawcab> to make sure the element was on screen before hitting next
2011-06-15T12:18:58  <lawcab> i don't think so
2011-06-15T12:19:00  <simonstewart> If you attach a "click" handler to body, does it tell you what the original target of the click was?
2011-06-15T12:19:05  <lawcab> as it stays on the page
2011-06-15T12:19:24  <lawcab> ok..how do i do that
2011-06-15T12:19:40  <lawcab> more info
2011-06-15T12:19:45  <lawcab> using java intellij
2011-06-15T12:19:53  <simonstewart> body.onclick = function(e) { alert(e.target); }
2011-06-15T12:20:24  <lawcab> oh..on the page itself....ewww...i am afraid i can't do that
2011-06-15T12:20:34  <simonstewart> You can with the JavascriptExecutor....
2011-06-15T12:20:45  <lawcab> oh...
2011-06-15T12:20:49  <simonstewart> :)

2011-06-15T12:21:55  <simonstewart> that doesn't look too bad
2011-06-15T12:22:53  <jrock20041> Nope, I think I might make that a function that you can pass in the the element name you want
2011-06-15T12:23:59  <lawcab> simonstewart: sorry...it might take me a while have not used that yet...so trying to figure it out

2011-06-15T14:24:59  <NLukish> Hi. I have a question. I am trying to run a Test Suite in Selenium RC (with Java) and it seems like the test cases don't work with the same window. I have the first test case that logs into the application, and then the second test case that starts doing something else. However, it seems the Firefox window gets closed after the first test case finishes, so the second test case opens its own, new Firefox window and can't find the obje
2011-06-15T14:28:08  <NLukish> is anyone in here?
2011-06-15T14:28:28  <algard> there are about 77 people in here
2011-06-15T14:29:50  <algard> in general we *want* each testcase to run in its own window
2011-06-15T14:30:16  <algard> in your case it sounds like you need to restructure things so that each 'testcase' is using the same browser reference
2011-06-15T14:30:35  <doc_tuna> so the same selenium object
2011-06-15T14:32:20  *** cburroughs has quit IRC
2011-06-15T14:32:36  <doc_tuna> you can build a method that instantiates a selenium object, use it across all your tests, then selenium.stop()
2011-06-15T14:32:56  <doc_tuna> but it would probably be better if you changed your tests such that they all work from a neutral state

2011-06-15T14:33:59  <ivog> Hi all!, what happened to the buildserver at xserve.openqa.org?
2011-06-15T14:36:16  <NLukish> thanks! I think this is going to be the only dependency. The scripts would need to "log in" to be able to do anything.
2011-06-15T14:36:23  <jarib> ivog: good question
2011-06-15T14:37:45  <doc_tuna> include the logging in portion in your initialization method
2011-06-15T14:37:54  <doc_tuna> where the selenium object is instantiated
2011-06-15T14:38:04  <ivog> jarib: im willing to help with keeping the buildserver up, who should i talk to again?
2011-06-15T14:38:08  <doc_tuna> and then logout prior to closing it

2011-06-15T14:38:57  <doc_tuna> NLukish: alternatively, if you have a cookie which establishes the session
2011-06-15T14:39:06  <doc_tuna> you can create the cookie at the start of each test
2011-06-15T14:39:22  <doc_tuna> so that your user is logged in
2011-06-15T14:39:54  <ivog> NLukish: are you dutch?

2011-06-15T14:47:11  <jarib> let's see
2011-06-15T14:47:14  <jarib> the main xserve is good
2011-06-15T14:47:46  <jarib> and that's where bamboo runs, so it really shouldn't have died

2011-06-15T15:37:08  <RSchulzB> We see a lot of (spurious) instances of the "Firefox is already running" alert during our Selenium tests. Today we upgraded our RC servers (running in a Grid) to Se2-RC2 and the symptom remains.
2011-06-15T15:37:28  <RSchulzB> Is this common? Is there a known fix or work-around? Is it a bad configuration on our part?
