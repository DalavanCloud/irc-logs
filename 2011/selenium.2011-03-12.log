2011-03-12T07:05:36  <eddm> hey, just a quick question: it's possible to provide more than one command line switch as part of my commandLineFlags, right? Like, nothing stopping me putting a space in that string? (passing "--ignore-certificate-errors --disable-web-security" to Google Chrome)
2011-03-12T07:05:48  <eddm> (sorry to just copy/paste my question from last night :x)

2011-03-12T08:04:10  <eddm> Further to my question above: I've managed to resolve this by using selenium server 2.x, which has support for the -trustAllSSLCertificates flag -- but I believe the problem still stands (for e.g. proving "--disable-web-security --crash-test" neither disables web security nor forces Chrome to crash, whereas providing only one of those two does have the desired effect)
2011-03-12T08:04:47  *** stepheneb has joined #selenium
2011-03-12T08:04:58  <eddm> Either I'm a dumbass, and I'm missing something, or there's something messing up when commandLineFlags is supplied with a space in it. (Probably the former)
2011-03-12T08:07:43  <eddm> I only used Selenium for the first time yesterday, so I'm reluctant to call it a bug
