2011-02-23T00:05:17  <selbot2> simon.m.stewart less than a minute ago - SimonStewart: Hard coding my way to victory. I believe that this code now gets a handle to the underlying native window on OS X. It also comprehensively breaks native events on linux and windows.

2011-02-23T01:49:47  <simonstewart> In return, I need a favour
2011-02-23T01:50:01  <AutomatedTester> sure
2011-02-23T01:50:05  <simonstewart> Any idea how to get hold of the (Cocoa) NSWindow given a reference to an element?
2011-02-23T01:50:24  <simonstewart> I'm starting to implement native events for OS X, but I need a window handle
2011-02-23T01:50:30  <AutomatedTester> NSWindow, assuming thats Moz?
2011-02-23T01:50:41  <simonstewart> And that's where it gets "funny"
2011-02-23T01:50:48  <simonstewart> Cocoa NSWindow
2011-02-23T01:50:49  <simonstewart> Not Moz
2011-02-23T01:51:08  * AutomatedTester will bing it with Google
2011-02-23T01:51:25  <simonstewart> Oh, if only it were that easy
2011-02-23T01:52:39  <AutomatedTester> what is the "element"
2011-02-23T01:52:42  <AutomatedTester> DOM element?
2011-02-23T01:52:50  <simonstewart> Yeah
2011-02-23T01:53:01  <simonstewart> A normal DOM Element
2011-02-23T01:53:26  <AutomatedTester> so you want a window by giving it an element...
2011-02-23T01:53:30  <simonstewart> I'm currently doing as much casting and QIing of interfaces in JS before dropping into objective c
2011-02-23T01:53:42  <simonstewart> I want the native window given the mozilla element
2011-02-23T01:53:42  <simonstewart> yes
2011-02-23T01:53:50  <simonstewart> On OS X
2011-02-23T01:54:02  <simonstewart> Because we've already got this working on Windows and Linux
2011-02-23T01:54:23  <AutomatedTester> arggg I hate my vms not keeping time when my MBP sleeps
2011-02-23T01:55:32  <simonstewart> Reading now
2011-02-23T01:55:56  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: where can I see the linux/windows equivalent code
2011-02-23T01:56:20  * AutomatedTester doesnt understand why you would want a window if you have a element 
2011-02-23T01:56:30  <AutomatedTester> since in my head you are already in the window
2011-02-23T01:56:33  <simonstewart> Here: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fcpp%2Fwebdriver-firefox
2011-02-23T01:56:37  <AutomatedTester> or is that what you are meaning
2011-02-23T01:56:54  <simonstewart> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/cpp/webdriver-firefox/native_events.cpp#40
2011-02-23T01:57:08  <simonstewart> The aim of the game is to send native (not synthesized) events
2011-02-23T01:57:21  <simonstewart> There is no facility for doing this baked into Firefox
2011-02-23T01:57:24  <AutomatedTester> ooooooooooooooo
2011-02-23T01:57:26  <simonstewart> So we have to handle it ourselves
2011-02-23T01:57:45  <simonstewart> Heh. I see the light go on from here :)

2011-02-23T02:03:31  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: do you have an idea of the window ID before doing the native events?
2011-02-23T02:07:51  <AutomatedTester> oh joy Win7SP1 released today
2011-02-23T02:13:44  <simonstewart> If I knew the ID, I'd be fine

2011-02-23T02:16:11  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: feedback sent
2011-02-23T02:17:38  <simonstewart> Hmph! I have an nsIBaseWindow from the element (I'm that good)
2011-02-23T02:17:47  <simonstewart> window->GetMainWidget(getter_AddRefs(mainWidget));
2011-02-23T02:17:50  <simonstewart> doesn't return a thing
2011-02-23T02:18:13  <AutomatedTester> thanks for the feedback
2011-02-23T02:18:30  <simonstewart> Basically: LGTM

2011-02-23T02:19:07  <AutomatedTester> I 1/2 did it, and I know what I mean, just need to explain it better
2011-02-23T02:19:27  <simonstewart> k
2011-02-23T02:19:47  <AutomatedTester> its the scale up scale down stale OMG

2011-02-23T02:20:18  * AutomatedTester is sometimes really bad explaining myself
2011-02-23T02:23:18  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: could you not get NSWindowList, iterate to said window, then do the commands?
2011-02-23T02:23:41  <simonstewart> How would I know that I've got the right window?
2011-02-23T02:23:57  <AutomatedTester> good question...
2011-02-23T02:24:21  <AutomatedTester> excluding pop-ups...
2011-02-23T02:24:44  <simonstewart> If I can get a reference to the underlying CocoaWindow, then I can call GetCocoaWindow and be done with it
2011-02-23T02:24:59  <AutomatedTester> nope, scratch that idea...

2011-02-23T04:38:30  <simonstewart> I've broken it now, but it's one of a couple of possibilities
2011-02-23T04:41:08  <simonstewart> Second run
2011-02-23T04:41:13  <simonstewart> That worked too

2011-02-23T04:45:05  <jarib> exciting
2011-02-23T04:45:55  <simonstewart> Well, all I've got now is (probably) the window handle
2011-02-23T04:46:12  <simonstewart> I've got a nasty feeling that there are other hurdles in the way
2011-02-23T04:47:24  <simonstewart> And I just hit the first bump.
2011-02-23T04:47:27  <simonstewart> That's not a window
2011-02-23T04:48:38  <simonstewart> Iterating through some possibilities
2011-02-23T05:00:44  <simonstewart> OK. It looks like if I call GetNativeData(NS_NATIVE_DISPLAY) I should get the window
2011-02-23T05:00:46  <simonstewart> But I don't

2011-02-23T06:05:36  <simonstewart> hi
2011-02-23T06:05:42  <AutomatedTester> hi again :)
2011-02-23T06:05:59  <AutomatedTester> *sigh* that person doesnt know...
2011-02-23T06:06:20  <davehunt> next Tuesday is our discussion on a browser automation standard
2011-02-23T06:06:25  <simonstewart> I'm almost there, I think
2011-02-23T06:06:28  <simonstewart> yes
2011-02-23T06:06:51  <davehunt> simonstewart: Still good for myself and AutomatedTester to head into Google earlier in the day?
2011-02-23T06:07:02  <simonstewart> Looks like because the focus event is never processed, the input manager isn't being enabled and my keyboard input is being swallowed
2011-02-23T06:07:09  <simonstewart> davehunt: sure
2011-02-23T06:07:14  <davehunt> cool
2011-02-23T06:07:27  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: asking in JS now for you
2011-02-23T06:07:33  <AutomatedTester> since there is people alive in there
2011-02-23T06:07:56  <simonstewart> Heh.
2011-02-23T06:08:11  <simonstewart> OK. I think I _may_ have got it
2011-02-23T06:08:18  <simonstewart> But it relies on the window having focus
2011-02-23T06:08:30  <AutomatedTester> can we force focus?
2011-02-23T06:08:39  <simonstewart> That's what I'm trying to do now
2011-02-23T06:09:55  <davehunt> I've scheduled the meeting, and will be more than happy to take notes, but I'm a bit unsure about chairing the meeting myself. I'm anticipating a rather broad discussion, so a chair may not even be necessary. Any thoughts?

2011-02-23T06:12:25  <simonstewart> I've been doing some thinking about what we need
2011-02-23T06:12:33  <davehunt> that would be awesome
2011-02-23T06:12:42  <simonstewart> I suspect that we'll end up with an IDL of some sort and then a reference implementation
2011-02-23T06:13:43  <davehunt> simonstewart: I've been asked to put together a simple agenda
2011-02-23T06:13:56  <simonstewart> OK. Can I mail you something tomorrow morning (my time)?
2011-02-23T06:14:02  <simonstewart> Who'll be there?
2011-02-23T06:14:12  <simonstewart> You, David, Eran, Me and Matt?
2011-02-23T06:14:18  <davehunt> Henrik and Clint too
2011-02-23T06:15:35  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: ted: AutomatedTester: probably, you'd need to get the containing window, then get its nsIWidget, then call GetNativeData on it to get the NSWindow*
2011-02-23T06:15:41  <simonstewart> Wow. Everyone's in town
2011-02-23T06:15:54  <davehunt> simonstewart: not in town, on the call
2011-02-23T06:15:57  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: Tried that :)
2011-02-23T06:16:00  <simonstewart> Ahhh... OK
2011-02-23T06:16:04  <simonstewart> That's a little easier :)
2011-02-23T06:16:14  <davehunt> only myself and David will be there in person
2011-02-23T06:16:30  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: I get the containing window via "element.ownerDocument.defaultView"
2011-02-23T06:16:32  <davehunt> I'll be adding call-in details to the invitation shortly
2011-02-23T06:16:39  <simonstewart> Should I be going for the chrome window instead?
2011-02-23T06:17:59  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: I asked that in #jsapi on moz irc
2011-02-23T06:18:09  <AutomatedTester> but they suggest I speak to bz
2011-02-23T06:18:18  <AutomatedTester> trying to find out who bz is
2011-02-23T06:18:26  <simonstewart> OK. I'm going to check in my WIP soon
2011-02-23T06:18:37  <simonstewart> One last test to go

2011-02-23T06:20:18  <simonstewart> Until the focus issue that we raised a while ago is fixed, I think we're close to "as good as it'll get"
2011-02-23T06:20:26  <simonstewart> Hi jimevans
2011-02-23T06:20:43  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: ok, lemme know if you want me to email said person
2011-02-23T06:20:51  <simonstewart> I think we'll be okay

2011-02-23T06:21:49  <simonstewart> OK. So there's a lot of broken code in there
2011-02-23T06:21:58  <simonstewart> But I can now automate typing the letter "a"

2011-02-23T06:22:16  <AutomatedTester> all good symphonies start with an A
2011-02-23T06:22:22  <jimevans> simonstewart: Did I remember you saying you had some IE driver native code fixes submitted from other Googlers?
2011-02-23T06:22:44  <simonstewart> Which I've not submitted, cos the chap working on them got a little carried away and got his client into an uncompilable state
2011-02-23T06:23:21  <jimevans> I... see. Well, if you want to send those over my way, I'll be glad to take a look... I'm hacking about in that code anyways.
2011-02-23T06:23:28  <simonstewart> The main bit is there's one place where we do "std::string.npos" and it should be "std::string::npos"
2011-02-23T06:23:41  <jimevans> ah. oops.
2011-02-23T06:23:57  <AutomatedTester> things like ^ make me hate programming
2011-02-23T06:23:59  <simonstewart> I'm on my Mac right now
2011-02-23T06:24:06  <simonstewart> IEDriverServer.cpp
2011-02-23T06:24:27  <simonstewart> Apparently, it compiles fine in VS2008 but not VS2010
2011-02-23T06:24:56  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: If you want to see firefox type an "a", then check out the "os_x_native_events" branch
2011-02-23T06:24:57  <jimevans> well, that's an easy fix.
2011-02-23T06:25:03  <simonstewart> jimevans: agreed :)
2011-02-23T06:25:35  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: and then run ./go //java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium:single:run log=true
2011-02-23T06:25:41  <davehunt> OSX native events? Awesome! :)
2011-02-23T06:26:07  * AutomatedTester needs to play catchup with python bindings on the native events
2011-02-23T06:26:17  <AutomatedTester> stupid day job
2011-02-23T06:26:20  <AutomatedTester> :P
2011-02-23T06:26:29  <AutomatedTester> right shower and food!!
2011-02-23T06:26:42  <simonstewart> If I do my job right, you'll get them for free
2011-02-23T06:26:57  <simonstewart> jimevans: I enabled the use of the logging.h primitives in the IE driver earlier
2011-02-23T06:27:12  <simonstewart> I seem to recall that you'd wanted them but had run into problems getting them running
2011-02-23T06:27:30  <jimevans> simonstewart: Saw that change. Thanks for that.
2011-02-23T06:27:36  <simonstewart> NP
2011-02-23T06:27:57  <simonstewart> Oh, and jarib, the new chromedriver is almost ready
2011-02-23T06:28:22  <jimevans> simonstewart: ^^ that's great news!
2011-02-23T06:28:41  <simonstewart> Yup :) Made me smile :)
2011-02-23T06:28:53  <eranm> simonstewart, re r11529: It only works for Firefox when it's in the foreground, right?
2011-02-23T06:28:55  <selbot2> simon.m.stewart 7 minutes ago - SimonStewart: I can now type an 'a' character on OS X - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11529
2011-02-23T06:29:04  <jimevans> I'm sort of looking at it as a model for how the final version of the IE driver will look.
2011-02-23T06:29:14  <simonstewart> eranm: yes, but it forces firefox into the foreground
2011-02-23T06:29:26  <eranm> I think it's a good enough solution
2011-02-23T06:29:42  <simonstewart> People will still complain :)
2011-02-23T06:30:47  <jimevans> eranm: can you take a look at something when you get a chance?
2011-02-23T06:31:14  <eranm> jimevans, sure
2011-02-23T06:31:27  <eranm> what is it?
2011-02-23T06:31:43  <jimevans> in the Java tests (WindowSwitchingTest.java), there is a testShouldBeAbleToIterateOverAllOpenWindows().
2011-02-23T06:31:48  <jimevans> This is currently ignored for IE.
2011-02-23T06:32:02  <jimevans> The .NET tests have an identical test that is not ignored, and it fails.
2011-02-23T06:32:15  <jimevans> It fails because the native click to the background window is failing.
2011-02-23T06:32:50  <jimevans> The link to click gets a "focus rectangle" around it, but the click doesn't seem to go through.
2011-02-23T06:33:10  <eranm> jimevans, the second click fails?
2011-02-23T06:33:31  <jimevans> yes.
2011-02-23T06:33:34  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: ETA on ChromeDriver
2011-02-23T06:33:52  <simonstewart> You can check it out now, but I think it's a couple of weeks away
2011-02-23T06:34:03  <simonstewart> We'll see how it goes
2011-02-23T06:34:05  <jimevans> eranm: I have one more "native events" thing that I can't figure out too, in sending keystrokes.
2011-02-23T06:34:08  <simonstewart> It's got this close before.....
2011-02-23T06:34:18  <simonstewart> Right. Hotel time.

2011-02-23T06:35:07  <eranm> jimevans, I'm deep to my elbows in IME input code on Linux. I will have a look at it when I'm done with this
2011-02-23T06:35:48  <jimevans> Ok, no hurry. I'm just can't seem to figure these last two bits out.
2011-02-23T06:35:54  <eranm> I'm royally annoyed by ibus on Linux. Combine a 32-bit library living inside 32-bit Firefox loaded by dlopen and something there breaks.
2011-02-23T06:36:37  <jimevans> Ack. That's messing with stuff far beyond my ken. :)
2011-02-23T06:39:03  <eranm> Not to force everybody to have ibus on their systems, we use dlopen to probe for the library (so if it's not there, all IME-related calls will gracefully fail).
2011-02-23T06:39:22  <eranm> It works perfectly fine on a 64-bit environment (64-bit OS, firefox and native libraries)
2011-02-23T06:40:44  <eranm> but on 32-bit, one of the calls fail
2011-02-23T06:41:12  <jimevans> sounds like a sane approach. it's stuff like this that makes me glad I don't have any hair to tear out.

2011-02-23T07:53:57  <gtailleb1> looking for some support with ie driver that crashes with selenium 2.0b2
2011-02-23T07:54:13  * jimevans sighs.
2011-02-23T07:54:16  <gtailleb1> anyone who can help me?
2011-02-23T07:54:30  <jimevans> gtailleb1: can you provide more context?
2011-02-23T07:54:34  <gtailleb1> sure
2011-02-23T07:55:23  <jimevans> okay what are you doing when the driver crashes?
2011-02-23T07:55:23  <gtailleb1> my first issue is that i keep getting a connect exception when i use ie remote driver => org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Connection refused: connect
2011-02-23T07:55:37  <gtailleb1> it worked fine with 2.0a7
2011-02-23T07:55:52  <gtailleb1> and it works fine with ff remote driver with 2.0b2
2011-02-23T07:56:38  <jimevans> The IE driver was completely rewritten between 2.0a7 and 2.0b1. It uses a completely different mechanism for controlling the browser than before.
2011-02-23T07:57:06  <gtailleb1> The server side message is => Caused by: org.apache.http.conn.HttpHostConnectException: Connection to http://l
2011-02-23T07:57:06  <gtailleb1> ocalhost:7394 refused
2011-02-23T07:57:44  <jimevans> is there a firewall running on the remote machine?
2011-02-23T07:57:56  <gtailleb1> am i the only one getting errors with ie remote driver for a simple task such as laucnshing the driver and retrieving a url??
2011-02-23T07:58:42  <gtailleb1> no, no firewall, i'm 100% local. my client and my server run on the same machine.
2011-02-23T07:58:57  <jimevans> No, in point of fact, you're not the only one. There are ongoing issues with the continuing development of the IE driver.
2011-02-23T07:59:27  <jimevans> What happens when you are not using the remote server?

2011-02-23T08:06:05  <jimevans> the IE driver now instantiates an HTTP server and the language binding communicates with the driver using the JSON wire protocol used by the Remote driver and its descendents

2011-02-23T08:13:11  <jimevans> Protected mode can be either on or off (I use on), but it must be the same for all zones.

2011-02-23T08:21:54  <gtailleb1> But connect still fails with remote web driver => in fact when i launch my remote webdriver server standalone, i am able to launch one remote IE driver correctly. The second attempt fails with a connectException and i must restart the standalone webdriver server
2011-02-23T08:22:11  <jarib> eranm: any input on that ^? are there benefits to the Action classes that would also make sense in python/ruby?

2011-02-23T08:23:14  <jimevans> gtailleb1: Are you calling the quit() method on the existing driver before you attempt to create the new instance?
2011-02-23T08:23:46  <eranm> gtailleb1, I hope you're not trying to start two IE instances at the same time?
2011-02-23T08:23:55  *** nitin has quit IRC
2011-02-23T08:24:29  <jimevans> eranm: that's now possible to do, but only if the language bindings support it. Java (and thus, the remote server) doesn't support it yet.
2011-02-23T08:24:38  <gtailleb1> i do not call the quit method for my test. I do not call 2 IE instances at the same time
2011-02-23T08:25:24  *** nitin has joined #selenium
2011-02-23T08:25:26  <gtailleb1> i'll try to call quit and see how it works
2011-02-23T08:25:28  <eranm> jimevans, neat. How do the two IE instances not share state like cookies and such?
2011-02-23T08:25:32  <jimevans> if you haven't called quit(), but are using 'new RemoteWebDriver()', then, in fact, you *are* calling 2 instances at the same time.
2011-02-23T08:26:10  <jimevans> eranm: when you launch the browser using the IELaunchURL() API, you're supposed to get a new session.
2011-02-23T08:26:20  <jimevans> you don't have that option when using CoCreateInstance.
2011-02-23T08:26:32  <gtailleb1> yes! it works when i call quit
2011-02-23T08:26:48  <eranm> jimevans, I see
2011-02-23T08:27:02  <jimevans> eranm: you can see the .NET bindings, and in particular IeSpecificTests.cs for an example.

2011-02-23T08:27:47  <jimevans> gtailleb1: no problem.
2011-02-23T08:27:52  <jimevans> glad to help
2011-02-23T08:28:37  <gtailleb1> so i need to call quit to notify the webdriver server to close the previous instance?
2011-02-23T08:28:52  <jimevans> exactly.
2011-02-23T08:29:08  <gtailleb1> ok, and what's the difference with close()?
2011-02-23T08:30:20  <jimevans> gtailleb1: close() is supposed to be equivalent to quit() if it's the last window open, but there may be a bug there.
2011-02-23T08:30:38  <gtailleb1> ok thanks again jimevans
2011-02-23T08:30:56  <jimevans> gtailleb1: np.

2011-02-23T09:12:02  <xirkus> jimevans: I asked this question on the selenium-devel email group but did not receive a response; is the goal to build the IE driver without ATL dependencies or simply migrate the solution to VS2010?
2011-02-23T09:12:24  *** stlewis has joined #selenium
2011-02-23T09:12:50  <jimevans> xirkus: the goal is simply to migrate to VS2010.  building the IE driver without ATL is not something I'm going to do.
2011-02-23T09:13:19  <jimevans> If somebody else wants to take it on, they're welcome to it. I'll hand over ownership of the IE driver C++ code to someone else in a heartbeat.
2011-02-23T09:14:13  <xirkus> <jimevans> does this mean that you will need VS2010 Professional; or does Express package the ATL dependencies that were not present in VS2008?
2011-02-23T09:15:14  <jimevans> xirkus: I have no idea what Visual C++ 2010 packages with it. I suspect that the ATL templates are still not included in Visual C++ 2010 Express, but i don't know for certain.
2011-02-23T09:15:27  * JuanDaugherty thinks you can use ATL with 2010 Xpress, seem to recall doing so
2011-02-23T09:16:10  <JuanDaugherty> it's an install option IIRC
2011-02-23T09:16:51  <xirkus> JuanDaugherty: cool. I'll give it a try.
2011-02-23T09:18:29  <xirkus> jimevans: thanks for the info.
2011-02-23T09:20:19  <xirkus> jimevans: I held off purchasing VS2008 for this reason; no point to spend the money if there is no need. Do you have an idea when the solution migration might happen?
2011-02-23T09:20:43  * JuanDaugherty uses MSVC8 and 2010 Xpress
2011-02-23T09:21:14  <JuanDaugherty> mozilla for example will only build (last I checked) with MSVC8
2011-02-23T09:21:26  <jimevans> xirkus: as soon as I get 'round to it.
2011-02-23T09:21:31  <JuanDaugherty> but 2010X is good for most stuff
2011-02-23T09:22:32  <JuanDaugherty> i.e. VS2K5 Professional for msvc8
2011-02-23T09:23:40  <jimevans> xirkus: After a quick search on the web, I'm pretty sure Visual C++ 2010 Express does *not* include ATL or MFC.
2011-02-23T09:24:03  <jimevans> note that we don't care about MFC, but we have to have ATL.
2011-02-23T09:24:32  <antlong> bah, 2.0b2 throws java.lang.ClassCastException: java.io.File cannot be cast to java.lang.String when using custom FF profiles

2011-02-23T09:24:57  <jimevans> JuanDaugherty: If you're running a different "full" version of Visual Studio on the same machine you're running Visual C++ 2010 Express on, you likely have some version of the ATL header files somewhere.
2011-02-23T09:25:34  <JuanDaugherty> do in fact have both on same machine

2011-02-23T11:30:38  <JuanDaugherty> xirkus, dunno what the IE driver requires. I presume that the WDK ATL set is complete, but dunno for sure.
2011-02-23T11:31:26  <JuanDaugherty> looks like you'll have to do discovery and set paths and what ever by hand to match the WDK installation
2011-02-23T11:33:05  <xirkus> JuanDaugherty: thanks. I'll play around with it to see if I can get it to build.

2011-02-23T20:16:47  <stephend|busy> mydog2: do you know about Hudson?
2011-02-23T20:16:55  <stephend|busy> or Jenkins, now
2011-02-23T20:17:04  <mydog2> nope...
2011-02-23T20:17:06  *** cburroughs has quit IRC
2011-02-23T20:17:10  <stephend|busy> you should check it out
2011-02-23T20:17:20  <mydog2> i'll check though
2011-02-23T20:17:23  <stephend|busy> it can use nose/ant, pretty much anything
2011-02-23T20:18:02  <stephend|busy> you can just give it shell commands, like /selenium2/bin/py.test-2.6 -n 2 --junitxml=results.xml
2011-02-23T20:18:31  <mydog2> stephend|busy, - here's my situation.... i'm going to have a bunch (100s) of apps that need to be run/tested.. i'd like a way of creating batches (batchfiles) of these apps, and to be able to schedule them to run for testing..
2011-02-23T20:18:51  <stephend|busy> yeah, try out Jenkins
2011-02-23T20:19:27  <mydog2> so i need a way of selecting the apps.. creating the batchfiles.. and then running the scheduled batch.. and od this from a web based gui..
2011-02-23T20:19:30  <mydog2> thanks..
2011-02-23T20:19:42  <stephend|busy> yep, np.  It's been a lifesaver for us
2011-02-23T20:19:52  <antlong> #jenkins-ci
2011-02-23T20:19:54  <stephend|busy> mydog2: you can schedule builds with cron syntax
2011-02-23T20:20:12  <stephend|busy> get xunit-style graphs, etc.  Lots of plugins.
2011-02-23T20:20:17  <stephend|busy> And, what antlong said :-)
2011-02-23T20:21:17  <stephend|busy> anybody running Selenium 2 w/Windows 7 SP1?
2011-02-23T20:21:33  <stephend|busy> wondering if I can just ugprade and not worry about my env.
2011-02-23T20:21:40  <stephend|busy> should be pretty safe, but you never know
2011-02-23T20:22:49  <antlong> i havent seen anything that would say otherwise
2011-02-23T20:22:58  * stephend|busy nods
