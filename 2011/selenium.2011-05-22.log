2011-05-22T04:07:39  <jarib> that's right

2011-05-22T04:07:50  <selbot2> simon.m.stewart 8 days ago - SimonStewart: Renaming ActionsChainsGenerator to Actions, deleting the interface and leaving only the implementation. Also removing the reference from HasInputDevices. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12180
2011-05-22T04:08:31  <jarib> docs are updated on release.
2011-05-22T04:08:32  <__mike> Ah great. Are the javadocs not automatically updated ?
2011-05-22T04:08:38  <__mike> I see
2011-05-22T04:09:20  <__mike> I asked a question about grid 2.0 not working on my machine for IE yesterday in the selenium-users group. Do you know what happened to that ? Is it still under moderation ? I'm not sure if I sent it correctly
2011-05-22T04:09:45  *** celm has quit IRC
2011-05-22T04:10:43  <jarib> not sure how that list is run, but it being under moderation sounds plausible..
2011-05-22T04:10:58  <jarib> you may have more luck in the "grid 2 testers" thread on selenium-developers though
2011-05-22T04:11:11  <__mike> Okay should I repost it there ?
2011-05-22T04:11:20  <__mike> I figured developers might just be for people developing :/
2011-05-22T04:13:31  <jarib> the thread is asking for people to try it out and provide feedback
2011-05-22T04:13:36  <jarib> and that's what you're doing

2011-05-22T07:38:39  <__mike> Does the WebDriver API have a function for waitforpagetoload ?
2011-05-22T07:45:02  <DarkRift_lp> what I did to manage that is make a DriverWait object, and wait 'til an element appears on the page
2011-05-22T07:45:21  <DarkRift_lp> because my calls were ajax
2011-05-22T07:45:36  <DarkRift_lp> but natively, I think it should handle it already, doesn't it ?
2011-05-22T07:52:44  *** DarkRift_lp is now known as DarkRift
2011-05-22T07:56:29  <__mike> it handles it when loading a page with get but actions won't block till the page loads
2011-05-22T07:57:51  <DarkRift> are your actions, ajax calls ?
2011-05-22T07:58:51  <DarkRift> what's the use case ? driver.get(); driver.findElement(...) and the .get() doesn't wait ?
2011-05-22T07:58:52  <__mike> nope. just clicking a button for example
2011-05-22T07:59:17  <__mike> oh sorry i didn't explain. i use get() then do action.click(...) which causes the page to change
2011-05-22T07:59:35  <__mike> so with the selenium rc api i think you can do s.waitforpagetoload or something ?
2011-05-22T08:00:04  <DarkRift> yeah I managed them with a DriverWait object where I tell it to wait for an element of the page to show up
2011-05-22T08:00:28  <DarkRift> which I assume is the same as waitforpagetoload in the version 1
2011-05-22T08:00:51  <DarkRift> well, not the same, but it manages that case
2011-05-22T08:01:39  <DarkRift> is your .click() on the button resulting in an ajax call ? the action handler of the button
2011-05-22T08:02:09  <__mike> i don't think so. just a regular href
2011-05-22T08:02:24  <DarkRift> if not, then there might be a problem, I dunno what's the intended behavior
2011-05-22T08:02:29  <__mike> what do you mean by driverwait object btw ? you mean the wait() ?
2011-05-22T08:03:22  <DarkRift> DriverWait wait = new DriverWait(timeToWaitMaxThenThrowException); wait.until(...
2011-05-22T08:04:04  <DarkRift> let me post you a simple example
2011-05-22T08:04:15  <DarkRift> ~pastebin
2011-05-22T08:04:21  <__mike> i don't have a driverwait object in my build

2011-05-22T08:04:48  <DarkRift> WebDriverWait
2011-05-22T08:04:55  <DarkRift> my bad
2011-05-22T08:05:38  <__mike> ahhh i see
2011-05-22T08:05:39  <DarkRift> WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,timeToWait)
2011-05-22T08:06:05  <DarkRift> after the time is reached, it will throw an exception
2011-05-22T08:06:17  <DarkRift> in your until calls
2011-05-22T08:06:19  <__mike> is the contents of until() javascript ?
2011-05-22T08:06:34  <DarkRift> nop, java
2011-05-22T08:06:58  <DarkRift> http://pastebin.com/wmfZEuKW
2011-05-22T08:07:10  <__mike> ah nice one
2011-05-22T08:07:19  <__mike> i did the same with javascript in selenium rc i think
2011-05-22T08:07:43  <__mike> in fact i was just wondering. can webdriver do eval() like selenium rc could ? i can't see that anywhere
2011-05-22T08:07:54  <__mike> the eval() let you specify javascript that would be executed on the browser
2011-05-22T08:08:07  <DarkRift> if the WebDriver implements JavascriptExecutor, you can cas it and call the method execute
2011-05-22T08:08:12  <DarkRift> cast *

2011-05-22T08:55:59  <abalon> I use Selenium::WebDriver,  and I do not understand how to save the picture.
2011-05-22T08:56:22  <abalon> Can somebody help me?
2011-05-22T08:56:24  <abalon> please
2011-05-22T08:57:05  <jarib> if you mean an <img> tag, webdriver doesn't have an api to save it to disk
2011-05-22T08:57:35  <jarib> if the image is publicly available, you could save use Net::HTTP to download it
2011-05-22T08:58:34  <abalon> jarib: yes from <img> tag
2011-05-22T08:58:48  <jarib> e.g. require 'open-uri'; File.open(path, "wb") { |io| io << open(element.attribute(:src)).read }
2011-05-22T08:59:11  <abalon> i can get src and use Net::HTTP but need cookies from WebDriver session
2011-05-22T08:59:26  <abalon> same user-aget etc...
2011-05-22T09:00:17  <jarib> you can get the cookies through the webdriver api
2011-05-22T09:00:43  <abalon> hm,, may i can save file?  sample: goto("url.jpg")  and output to binary file?
2011-05-22T09:01:41  <abalon> I will suffer with net:: http

2011-05-22T11:15:59  <DarkRift> __mike for your boolean problem, you don't need to cast it, java will do auto boxing to Boolean if you do : return true; or you can do Boolean.TRUE and Boolean.FALSE
2011-05-22T11:18:19  <__mike> it does not autobox and for some reason Boolean.false is not recognised. so odd
2011-05-22T11:20:56  <DarkRift> false should be uppercase
2011-05-22T11:20:58  <DarkRift> not lowercase
2011-05-22T11:21:18  <DarkRift> in Boolean.FALSE that is
