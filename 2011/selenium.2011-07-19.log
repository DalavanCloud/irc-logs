2011-07-19T00:06:21  <msturm> I have an issue with a TinyMCE rich text editor in Chrome. Basically, it seems to be impossible to input text in the rich text editor with Selenium 2.0.0 (and a selenium grid)
2011-07-19T00:06:31  <msturm> is this a known issue?

2011-07-19T00:39:54  <jarib> pngl: elements in watir-webdriver are lazily located - we don't know the subtype when we create the object
2011-07-19T00:40:41  <jarib> (this is why you can do things like element.exists? or element.wait_until_present etc)
2011-07-19T00:42:38  <pngl> Thank you! Although this plus a couple of other decisions sometimes force verbosity:
2011-07-19T00:42:39  <pngl> * to_subtype must always be called when using watir.element instead of watir.form, watir.a, etc.
2011-07-19T00:43:13  <pngl> * but watir.form is sometimes not an option since :css => ... is not compatible with tag-specific selectors.

2011-07-19T02:08:12  <papegaaij> hi all, i'm looking for a way to let the webdriver start firefox maximized
2011-07-19T02:08:53  <freynaud> papegaaij: you can use JS for that
2011-07-19T02:09:20  *** AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
2011-07-19T02:09:22  *** davehunt has quit IRC
2011-07-19T02:09:30  <papegaaij> freynaud: will that work cross-browser?
2011-07-19T02:10:42  <freynaud> it should. You can have a look at WebDriverBackedSelenium is you want a idea on how to have selenium1 old command done. WindowsMaximize.java is what you're asking for
2011-07-19T02:11:13  <pngl> It seems like since I moved from RC to Webdriver, Selenium waits longer for the pages to load. Just by eyeballing the page loading, it looks like RC didn't wait for the images to be loaded while Webdriver only starts acting after all the images have been displayed. Is that the case?
2011-07-19T02:12:00  <papegaaij> freynaud: thanks, i'll have a look at it
2011-07-19T02:12:06  <AutomatedTester> pngl: *think* so
2011-07-19T02:12:11  <AutomatedTester> hey freynaud
2011-07-19T02:12:32  <papegaaij> btw, when do you think the 2.1.0 artifacts will be available in maven central?
2011-07-19T02:13:16  <AutomatedTester> papegaaij: when the next brave committer offers to go through the maze to get the keys to the maven upload

2011-07-19T02:17:10  <papegaaij> freynaud: it's a lot of work to deploy all artifacts by hand, and you run into the risk of differences between the official artifacts and the ones you deploy manually
2011-07-19T02:17:45  <pngl> Is it possible to tell Webdriver to consider the page as loaded before the images have actually loaded?

2011-07-19T02:20:23  <freynaud> papegaaij: you cannot build selenium with maven. I build with ./go release, get the jar, then deploy the jar
2011-07-19T02:21:21  <papegaaij> freynaud: but selenium has many jars
2011-07-19T02:21:27  <papegaaij> and you also need the poms

2011-07-19T02:25:01  <papegaaij> in fact, to get selenium working, i had to resolve several, selenium requires a httpclient that conflicts with our version of axis2

2011-07-19T02:25:45  <papegaaij> i run selenium from inside the application, which gives me access to both the server and the client at the same time
2011-07-19T02:26:27  <papegaaij> this way, i can create the account the tests will use, query for certain objects, etc
2011-07-19T02:28:53  <papegaaij> btw, the piece of js from WindowMaximize works, thanks
2011-07-19T02:29:41  <freynaud> papegaaij: cool. Go one lvl up to webdriver back. It has all the mapping for sel1 to sel2. Good to read if you're migrating.

2011-07-19T04:01:16  <urbanfbi> output: Started ChromeDriver port=13934 ... the chrome browser starts, but it still does not open google.com but debian.org (the default page)

2011-07-19T04:05:31  <simonstewart> Or you could just navigate to the correct site and set the cookie manuallu
2011-07-19T04:06:27  <sdqali> Interesting thing is, while we are able to reproduce it consistently on certain boxes, it works perfectly fine on others. Not sure what the pattern is at all.

2011-07-19T04:14:36  <urbanfbi> the chromium browser that is delivered by debian squeeze seems not to be compatible with the chrome driver. Since we want to do some testing on debian servers, the chrome driver may not be a good solution for us. Hope, that the firefox driver is stable enough

2011-07-19T04:40:55  <dawagner> angshu: submit delegates to click, so it should fire the onclick (at a guess)

2011-07-19T04:41:57  <angshu> dawagner: not sure, if a button does form.submit() on click() event, then button.submit() doesnt seem to work.
2011-07-19T04:42:31  <wilhelm> AutomatedTester: The scope of this particular meeting is to learn from each other about how each of us do testing, with the goal of figuring out 1) what we need to do to make all browser vendors use tests from the W3C and 2) how we can make all browser vendors contribute their tests to the W3C.
2011-07-19T04:42:43  <angshu> I am guessing element.submit() does form.submit() internally?
2011-07-19T04:43:15  <angshu> and wondering whether button.submit() triggers the onclick event associated with.
2011-07-19T04:43:17  <wilhelm> AutomatedTester: There are three main categories of tests we should dicuss – 1) visual tests (rendering, CSS, images), 2) JavaScript-driven tests (testing DOM stuff, JS APIs) and 3) tests that require some sort of user interaction.

2011-07-19T06:10:20  <papegaaij> or is that asking for trouble? :)
2011-07-19T06:10:24  <angshu> dawagner: will do.
2011-07-19T06:10:34  <jarib> ammar01: yes, you need to point it to the browsermob-proxy executable (it's a shell script included in the distribution)
2011-07-19T06:10:36  <ammar01> tried to write a batch file to run the "java -jar" command but that wouldn't work the way you intended I think (having control of the server pid, etc) - do you know of a way to get this code to work?
2011-07-19T06:10:54  <ammar01> ahhh - couldn't see the executable..will have a look now thx
2011-07-19T06:10:59  <jarib> ammar01: however the distribution has a slightly outdated version of the jar
2011-07-19T06:11:09  <jarib> and the ruby bindings are coded against the HEAD jar
2011-07-19T06:11:18  <jarib> so it's not super-easy to set up atm
2011-07-19T06:11:24  <Parabola> is there a changelog for 2.0 > 2.1
2011-07-19T06:11:50  <ammar01> reading that sample code I just wanted to really try it out asap but maybe I have to be patient :)
2011-07-19T06:12:00  <jarib> ammar01: easiest is probably to download the distribution from proxy.browsermob.com and replace the main jar with one built from HEAD
2011-07-19T06:12:10  <simonstewart> Parabola: I can create a change log
2011-07-19T06:12:32  <jarib> ammar01: or just run the server from an IDE for now
2011-07-19T06:12:54  <ammar01> i'll give it a shot - thanks jarib

2011-07-19T06:22:57  <papegaaij> freynaud: i followed the instructions on the wiki for grid2, but i can't get the webdriver working, connecting to the hub keeps giving 'Empty pool of VM for setup {platform=LINUX, browserName=firefox, version=5.0}'
2011-07-19T06:23:41  <papegaaij> i started the webdriver with '–role webdriver -browser browserName=firefox,version=5.0,platform=LINUX' (also tried lowercase linux and with less options)

2011-07-19T06:25:14  <angshu> jarib: funny is that if you change the textarea content using javascript, then getText() still provides the initial texts, and then you have to use getAttribute('value') :)
2011-07-19T06:25:22  <simonstewart> Because a release a week without a continuous build basically means that jimevans, you, AutomatedTester and I spend a week running tests
2011-07-19T06:26:18  <jarib> angshu: this sounds like a buggy browser
2011-07-19T06:27:13  <angshu> jarib: both FF4, 5, and Chrome 12.0.724?
2011-07-19T06:27:40  <ammar01> jarib, np!
2011-07-19T06:27:44  <jarib> angshu: what do you mean by "change the textarea content using javascript"?
2011-07-19T06:28:22  <angshu> jarib: as in document.getElementById('someTextarea').value = 'some value'
2011-07-19T06:29:17  <angshu> jarib: which I would think pretty common today, especially with all ReST and ajaxy stuff
2011-07-19T06:29:56  <angshu> anyways, I will lookout for such hickups and notify you guys as much as I can.
2011-07-19T06:31:32  *** ssims has quit IRC
2011-07-19T06:32:20  <papegaaij> i've got the idea that the server started with -role webdriver is not connecting to the hub
2011-07-19T06:33:01  <papegaaij> when i start the webdriver when the hub is not running, i don't get an error
2011-07-19T06:33:36  <jarib> angshu: right - the spec says "The textarea element represents a multiline plain text edit control for the element's raw value. The contents of the control represent the control's default value."
2011-07-19T06:33:52  <papegaaij> doh
2011-07-19T06:34:05  <papegaaij> i copy-pasted the line from the wiki, but the - on the wiki is not the right -
2011-07-19T06:34:27  <papegaaij> notice the difference between '–role' and '-role'
2011-07-19T06:34:37  <jarib> angshu: so whatever is inside the element is just the "default value" - it's not updated to represent changes to the element's value (either by a user typing or JS modifying the value property)
2011-07-19T06:35:39  <jarib> this could be considered a bug in our getText()

2011-07-19T06:37:31  <papegaaij> ok, got it working now
2011-07-19T06:39:36  <angshu> jarib: the initial value depends on other options in page. If user chooses a different option, then the js code will change value depending on response from server.
2011-07-19T06:40:06  <angshu> jarib: would assume so. Also verified on FF 3.6. I can simulate the same with simple html and javascript code too.
2011-07-19T06:40:21  <jarib> sounds like you can just use getAttribute('value') though
2011-07-19T06:40:29  <jarib> there's no case where that won't be correct

2011-07-19T07:33:45  <antlong> trapni the selenium server is necessary to run tests, it basically is the brain of the operation
2011-07-19T07:34:33  <adamgoucher> but only if you are using the remote control api or remote webdriver one. if you are using 'just' webdriver then you dont need the server

2011-07-19T07:39:57  <jimevans> AJ_: are you using the Selenium RC API, or the Selenium WebDriver API?
2011-07-19T07:40:10  <AJ_> jimevans : Selenium RC API
2011-07-19T07:41:21  <jimevans> Okay, I'm not going to know the answer then. Same origin policy problem, maybe?
2011-07-19T07:43:30  <AJ_> If it was the same origin policy pbm, I would expect it to always fail. Right now this issue is intermittent. May be 10 out of 25 tests would fail due to this reason. Also, the click action was successfully executed. I could see the next page loading due to click. But still the error thrown indicates that issue is with click command

2011-07-19T07:47:12  <antlong> could be, try throwing a sleep or something in there and run it a few times
2011-07-19T07:47:27  <AJ_> I can see the button in the screenshot. And my tests will move to click only after button becomes visible. So thats taken care I think
2011-07-19T07:48:17  <trapni> antlong, adamgoucher: so basically, I could end up writing a cronjob that's *simply* calling the tests as I would do by hand - each day. no need for the selenium-server.jar then, right?

2011-07-19T09:13:03  <jimevans> I don't see another choice. Many other open-source .NET projects do the same.
2011-07-19T09:14:00  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: where would I find the IEDriver server and command handler code
2011-07-19T09:14:12  <AutomatedTester> looked in files by that name and its not what I was expecting
2011-07-19T09:14:48  <jimevans> the "common to all C++ implementations" code was moved to the webdriver-server project ($/cpp/webdriver-server).

2011-07-19T09:15:57  <danielwh> jimevans: Just wanted to check we weren't doing anything insane - it seemed a bit odd... (Other option would be giving the key to a few people, and only signing our releases - anyone else can sign their own with their own snk if they want)
2011-07-19T09:16:01  <jimevans> the idea was to make it easier for, say, a headless webkit driver to build their own json wire protocol server bit.
2011-07-19T09:16:02  <AutomatedTester> thanks jimevans
2011-07-19T09:18:32  <jimevans> danielwh: i mean, I can always back out the assembly signing stuff.
2011-07-19T09:19:16  <jimevans> i had a couple of people ask for it, and it's a prelude to creating a *sigh* nuget package.

2011-07-19T09:33:13  <danielwh> I'm all for signing, but giving our private keys to the world seems to subvert the point; if people want signed assemblies, it's either because 1) they want a real chain of trust, or 2) they want to tick a box.  Distributing our keys supports 2 (which, I suspect, is the majority request), keeping them private and signing our releases supports 1, in my opinion...

2011-07-19T12:45:44  <supa__> Hi.  I'm having a terrible time trying to create a jar out of project that works just fine in eclipse.  I'm trying to use the 2.1 standalone jar (it's in the classpath) but I keep getting org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver ClassNotFoundExceptions.
2011-07-19T12:45:45  <jimevans> no, there is no such code in the IE driver.
2011-07-19T12:46:12  <jarib> supa__: for what class?
2011-07-19T12:46:25  <jarib> MikeSmith: hi, nice to see you here :)

2011-07-19T12:47:02  <Siph-Droid> Jimevans, so I need to mess with the ie settings to somehow get it to work?
2011-07-19T12:47:02  <jarib> then the standalone jar can't be on your classpath - that class is definitely in the jar
2011-07-19T12:47:10  <supa__> Ya - and it works in eclipse.
2011-07-19T12:47:11  <supa__> hm
2011-07-19T12:48:06  <jimevans> Siph-Droid: I'm pretty sure you're out of luck in IE at the moment. If there's a way around it using browser settings, I don't know it.
2011-07-19T12:48:17  <jimevans> (which doesn't mean it doesn't exist)
2011-07-19T12:48:54  <Siph-Droid> Ok thx I will mess around with it today.

2011-07-19T13:33:35  *** hubc has joined #selenium
2011-07-19T13:34:03  <hubc> hi, does anyone know if it's possible to execute find_elements (webdriver) using 2 locator types?
2011-07-19T13:34:03  *** soc42 has quit IRC
2011-07-19T13:34:28  <hubc> for example...  driver.find_elements(:tag_name => "a", ;class => "whatever")
2011-07-19T13:34:53  <hubc> seems to only find using the first locator
2011-07-19T13:35:03  <jarib> hubc: yeah, that's not supported
2011-07-19T13:35:15  <hubc> ah - ok
2011-07-19T13:35:17  <jarib> actually, we should probably raise if you pass more than one
2011-07-19T13:35:29  <jarib> watir-webdriver supports that though, you may want to check it out
2011-07-19T13:35:38  <jarib> it wraps webdriver in a slightly higher level api
2011-07-19T13:36:13  <hubc> gotcha, thanks.
2011-07-19T13:36:33  <hubc> also, any support for the RC command wait_for_frame_to_load?
2011-07-19T13:36:38  <jarib> or you could (a) filter in ruby: driver.find_elements(:tag_name => "a").select { |e| e.attribute(:class).include? "whatever" }
2011-07-19T13:37:02  *** blowery is now known as blowery_off
2011-07-19T13:37:14  <jarib> or (b) use xpath: driver.find_elements(:xpath => "//a[@class='whatever']"
2011-07-19T13:37:28  <jarib> or (c) css: driver.find_elements(:css => "a.whatever")
2011-07-19T13:37:46  <hubc> does the :css selector work for all browsers?
2011-07-19T13:37:47  <jarib> no, webdriver doesn't have wait_for_frame_to_load
2011-07-19T13:38:00  <jarib> it should, yes
2011-07-19T13:38:17  <hubc> awesome - ok
2011-07-19T13:38:24  <hubc> and one more thing, lol
2011-07-19T13:38:26  <jarib> for waiting, check out the Selenium::WebDriver::Wait class or configure implicit waits

2011-07-19T13:43:44  <jarib> hubc: does it happen for any xpath? or just that specific page/element?
2011-07-19T13:44:02  <jarib> also, what version of selenium-webdriver do you have installed?
2011-07-19T13:44:09  <hubc> it was just that specific page, the other xpath errors throw the correct error
2011-07-19T13:44:13  <jarib> ah
2011-07-19T13:44:23  <hubc> also, the xpath is from an iframe
2011-07-19T13:44:25  <jimevans> looking at the code, it's *possible* that we'd throw an error other than NoSuchElement.
2011-07-19T13:44:26  <jarib> then it'd be interesting to see the page, or a reduced example that will reproduce it
2011-07-19T13:44:58  <jimevans> not likely, but possible.
2011-07-19T13:45:02  <jarib> jimevans: with the "unable to find element" message? that'd be a bug, no?
2011-07-19T13:45:04  <hubc> i'm using 2.0.1
2011-07-19T13:45:34  <jarib> right, and this is using the remote server, so the revision is right there in the message.
2011-07-19T13:45:59  <jimevans> the error handling in the findElement command handler is stupid.
2011-07-19T13:46:12  <jarib> hubc: if you could create an example page (perhaps with an iframe if necessary), that'd be most helpful
2011-07-19T13:46:39  <jimevans> well, maybe not stupid, but certainly naive.
2011-07-19T13:48:07  <hubc> jarib: let me see if i can get that done

2011-07-19T13:52:05  *** red^ is now known as reddeviL
2011-07-19T13:53:50  <jimevans> the causes are as follows:
2011-07-19T13:54:18  <jimevans> could be a javascript execution error when attempting to use the injected javascript xpath engine
2011-07-19T13:54:29  <jimevans> could be a failure to inject said engine
2011-07-19T13:54:54  <jimevans> could be that the return of the javascript function isn't an element.
2011-07-19T13:55:26  <jimevans> that's most likely to least likely
2011-07-19T13:56:07  <ruel_> i'm trying to select an empty option
2011-07-19T13:56:13  <ruel_> <option value=""></option>
2011-07-19T13:56:23  <jarib> jimevans: perhaps the error message shouldn't be so similar to the regular "not found" message
2011-07-19T13:56:27  <jarib> in those cases
2011-07-19T13:56:43  <jimevans> i agree. as i said, the error reporting is extremely naive.

2011-07-19T13:57:18  <jarib> ruel_: does it throw an error?
2011-07-19T13:57:21  <ruel_> nope
2011-07-19T13:57:26  <ruel_> it just doesn't select anything
2011-07-19T13:57:45  <jarib> does it work if you get a WebElement for the option and click that?
2011-07-19T13:58:07  <jarib> if so, it's a bug in the Select class

2011-07-19T15:11:28  <toddnine> Hi guys.  We're using page objects and after upgrading from the last beta to the current 2.0.0, our tabs are no longer working in our firefox driver.  Here is the page object and our test.  https://gist.github.com/d8827a876abf55847289
2011-07-19T15:11:35  <toddnine> Any ideas why this isn't working?
2011-07-19T15:14:35  <toddnine> I'm on FF5.  Every other test works perfectly, it's just the empty input and tab out that seems to fail
2011-07-19T15:15:17  <jarib> what os?
2011-07-19T15:15:40  <balevine> jarib: What you provided is working.  Thank you!  However, the URLs I'm writing all go to example.com - I'm using the Firefox driver.  I know I've seen this setting somewhere, but I can't find it...
2011-07-19T15:16:47  <jarib> balevine: sounds like you're using capybara? i don't know how that works
2011-07-19T15:17:10  <balevine> jarib: Yes, I'm using capybara. Thanks for the help though!
2011-07-19T15:17:28  <jarib> webdriver itself only accepts absolute URLs, so there's nothing in our code to do that

2011-07-19T15:23:17  <new2b2> Hi, i am trying to test an https site with webdriver but getting a security warning. I know with selenium RC I could do -trustAllSSLCertificates and that worked, how do i do the same with webdriver?

2011-07-19T15:33:31  <jarib> in firefox it should work out of the box
2011-07-19T15:33:43  <jarib> what sort of warning do you get?
2011-07-19T15:36:44  <new2b2> it's the generic "SiteAdvisor"
2011-07-19T15:36:56  <new2b2> "Use caution on this site"
2011-07-19T15:37:24  <jarib> don't recognize that
2011-07-19T15:37:35  <jarib> could you paste more details or take a screenshot?
2011-07-19T15:37:38  <new2b2> I had the same problem when i used selenium rc but it was solved when i ran the server with parameter of -trustAllSSLCertificates

2011-07-19T15:38:12  <new2b2> it's by mcAfee SiteAdvisor
2011-07-19T15:38:18  <jarib> oh
2011-07-19T15:38:23  <new2b2> An unacceptable security risk is posed by this site.  McAfee Security Rating: Unrated
2011-07-19T15:38:27  <jarib> no idea then
2011-07-19T15:38:36  <jarib> uninstall it?
2011-07-19T15:38:46  <new2b2> required at my company
2011-07-19T15:39:28  <new2b2> will have to dig further into it
2011-07-19T15:39:47  <jarib> perhaps you can add exceptions for the site's you're testing
2011-07-19T15:39:55  <new2b2> right now i only have a few scripts using selenium rc library, should i switch over to webdriver?
2011-07-19T15:40:13  <jarib> yes
2011-07-19T15:40:18  <jarib> IMO
2011-07-19T15:40:40  <new2b2> that's the feeling i am getting too, before the scripts get developed further
2011-07-19T15:40:45  <jarib> especially if you expect the number of scripts to grow over time
2011-07-19T15:40:47  <new2b2> seems that webdriver is the next step of selenium
2011-07-19T15:40:51  <new2b2> oh most definitely
2011-07-19T15:41:05  <jarib> it is. the RC API will be deprecated eventually
2011-07-19T15:41:19  <new2b2> right now it's about 5, i expect minimum of 50 in a few months (3-6?) time
2011-07-19T15:41:30  <new2b2> ok then yeah I'm definitely making the switch then

2011-07-19T15:47:21  <new2b2> no, i get a different error because I am trying to use the 'driver.current_url' and it's giving me something weird
2011-07-19T15:47:28  <new2b2> string with 'unicode: ' in it
2011-07-19T15:47:42  <jarib> what language?
2011-07-19T15:47:45  <new2b2> i haven't gotten to researching that yet

2011-07-19T23:33:46  <cerberos> jarib: excellent, thanks
2011-07-19T23:33:47  <papegaaij> when i connect to http://127.0.0.1:4444/grid/console, i get a 403 Forbidden for Proxy
2011-07-19T23:34:12  <easonhan> jarib:please wait for a minutes, let me have a try
2011-07-19T23:36:40  <papegaaij> all urls give a 403, including / and /grid/register
2011-07-19T23:36:46  <papegaaij> any idea what could be wrong?
2011-07-19T23:37:51  *** skiz has quit IRC
2011-07-19T23:38:22  <papegaaij> i simply use 'java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.1.0.jar -rol hub' to start the hub
2011-07-19T23:42:43  <papegaaij> i think this issue should be reopened: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=592

2011-07-19T23:44:45  <easonhan> jarib: here is the result  :name=>correct,value=>"xxxxx", :path=>"/", :domain=>"wrong_domain_i_want_to_access.com", :expires=>#<DateTime: 2030-07-20T06:46:45+00:00 (2462702.7824768517,0,2299161)>,
2011-07-19T23:45:41  <easonhan> the page redirect to the wrong domain, so the cookie i added did not work...
2011-07-19T23:49:26  <papegaaij> i really don't get it, what can be wrong with starting the jar with '-rol hub'?
2011-07-19T23:49:32  <papegaaij> shouldn't that just work?
2011-07-19T23:50:37  <jarib> easonhan: well, you have to be on the riht domain.
2011-07-19T23:50:42  <jarib> *right

2011-07-19T23:52:18  <easonhan> jarib: i went to the right domian, then it redirect to the wrong domain, so i added the cookie to the incorrct domain.
2011-07-19T23:53:36  <easonhan> then i set the cookie before i went to the domain, an errror occured, that is because i did not set cookie to current domain...
2011-07-19T23:54:23  <easonhan> I got no idea of how to solve this problem
