2011-02-21T06:02:01  <AutomatedTester> how was/is your travels?
2011-02-21T06:03:17  <selbot2> tkumarb 1 minute ago - tkumarb: Added section on Page Object in chapter 6. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11492
2011-02-21T06:03:30  <eranm> AutomatedTester, came back from Tokyo on Friday - it was pretty good
2011-02-21T06:05:52  <AutomatedTester> eranm: cool, I am very jealous of you and Simon, Tokyo is somewhere I want to go one day
2011-02-21T06:06:38  <eranm> You definitely should. It's an interesting city and the culture is very interesting as well
2011-02-21T06:06:42  <selbot> New news from builds: WEB-SEHQ-70 was SUCCESSFUL : Updated by tkumarb <http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/WEB-SEHQ-70>
2011-02-21T06:20:20  <eranm> We'll soon have proper complex-script input support in Selenium 2

2011-02-21T06:23:14  <AutomatedTester> eranm: ?
2011-02-21T06:24:48  <eranm> Do you know how Japanese, for example, is typed?
2011-02-21T06:25:28  *** zmijunkie has joined #selenium
2011-02-21T06:25:54  <AutomatedTester> I assumed, probably incorrectly, that the keyboard had basic words and OS would then combine them as it saw fit
2011-02-21T06:26:08  <AutomatedTester> because certain combinations become new words
2011-02-21T06:26:17  <AutomatedTester> plus their alphabet is HUGE...
2011-02-21T06:26:57  <eranm> Sort of - you type the phonetic representation of a word and then a helper process (called IME engine) converts it to the Kanji word (symbol)
2011-02-21T06:27:23  <eranm> We've had a wad to input Unicode characters using the Selenium 2 API for a while now - and it worked with native input, too.
2011-02-21T06:27:52  <eranm> But that's only good for languages where that's how the application gets the input (i.e. simple scripts)
2011-02-21T06:28:37  <eranm> When you type a Hebrew or Arabic letter on the keyboard, the browsers gets the relevant key events with the right unicode character .
2011-02-21T06:28:57  <eranm> So it makes sense to write a test that sends unicode directly (using sendKeys) - as it perfectly emulates the user.
2011-02-21T06:29:38  <eranm> With complex scripts, that is wrong - the webapp can actually listen to the key presses and provide suggestions based on partial input, even before the IME engine translated it to Kanji
2011-02-21T06:30:26  <eranm> (Think google suggest)
2011-02-21T06:31:01  <AutomatedTester> ahh
2011-02-21T06:31:09  <AutomatedTester> wicked
2011-02-21T06:31:37  <eranm> So we need a way to activate the IME engine, send latin characters, verify that they get translated to the phonetic representations (read up on Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana if you really want to know about the different scripts)
2011-02-21T06:33:02  <eranm> And that's what I've been working on in Tokyo
2011-02-21T06:33:16  <AutomatedTester> is that what Mr Stewart was doing too?
2011-02-21T06:33:21  <AutomatedTester> was/is?
2011-02-21T06:34:29  <eranm> No, he's advising to another project that is related to driving native Android apps using the WebDriver API. I hope there'll be a demonstration of this at the Selenium Conference

2011-02-21T07:41:54  <jarib> since i think we can make the implementation of the builder interface much flatter than what java has

2011-02-21T07:49:37  <AutomatedTester> yea, I agree totally
2011-02-21T07:49:49  <jarib> ok, good :)
2011-02-21T07:51:22  <AutomatedTester> only question i do have, the Java Implementation casts it to check that driver can do the inputs
2011-02-21T07:52:46  <AutomatedTester> I think we should do a similar check, perferably without casting
2011-02-21T07:56:04  <XCulver> any c# users here?
2011-02-21T07:56:20  <AutomatedTester> XCulver: what's up?
2011-02-21T07:57:41  <XCulver> i'm a little new to it
2011-02-21T07:57:49  <XCulver> and i'm trying to use the screenshot utility
2011-02-21T07:57:54  <XCulver> with any driver
2011-02-21T07:58:13  <XCulver> essentially i have the driver type passed in from the config file
2011-02-21T07:58:19  <XCulver> so my code all uses a generic driver
2011-02-21T07:58:43  <XCulver> and which one can i use should i cast to get the screen shot?
2011-02-21T07:58:51  <XCulver> am i making sense?
2011-02-21T07:59:22  <AutomatedTester> When your code creates a driver it creates a concrete version of that driver instead of using the interface
2011-02-21T07:59:25  <XCulver> i have a static class for accessing the driver that i initialize when starting my test framework
2011-02-21T07:59:26  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-02-21T07:59:40  <XCulver> right
2011-02-21T07:59:44  <AutomatedTester> the interface is just a "contract" that it will have the right methods
2011-02-21T07:59:52  <XCulver> ok
2011-02-21T07:59:58  <XCulver> the interface doesn't have the screenshot method though
2011-02-21T08:00:00  <AutomatedTester> then you just need to GetScreenshot()
2011-02-21T08:00:11  <XCulver> iwebdriver
2011-02-21T08:01:22  <AutomatedTester> but if you have a concrete type it should give you the extra methods
2011-02-21T08:01:28  <XCulver> right
2011-02-21T08:01:34  <XCulver> but i dont know the concrete type till runtime
2011-02-21T08:01:44  <XCulver> so i'm only accessing the interface
2011-02-21T08:02:01  <AutomatedTester> no, but at runtime the CLR knows what you mean
2011-02-21T08:02:07  <AutomatedTester> is it not compiling?
2011-02-21T08:02:25  <XCulver> Screenshot ss = WebDriverStore.CurrentWebDriver.GetScreenshot();
2011-02-21T08:02:29  <XCulver> gives me an error

2011-02-21T08:03:01  <XCulver> OpenQA.Selenium.IWebDriver does not contain a definition for 'GetScreenshot' and no extension method 'GetScreenshot' accepting a first arg ect...
2011-02-21T08:03:54  <AutomatedTester> ahh right
2011-02-21T08:04:03  *** andytinkham has quit IRC
2011-02-21T08:04:03  <AutomatedTester> can I see how you are creating the driveR?
2011-02-21T08:04:07  <AutomatedTester> driver even?
2011-02-21T08:04:10  <XCulver> yah
2011-02-21T08:04:27  <XCulver> i have a basic static class with one property for accessing a IWebDriver
2011-02-21T08:04:39  <XCulver> and in the teststartup
2011-02-21T08:04:56  <XCulver> i set that property to a new driver based on whatever it is in the .config
2011-02-21T08:05:25  <AutomatedTester> have you had a look how we do it with our tests in trunk?
2011-02-21T08:05:46  <XCulver> i have the code but i havent looked at it that closely
2011-02-21T08:05:50  <AutomatedTester> that reads the .config when running and with reflection creates the right driver
2011-02-21T08:06:12  <XCulver> that sounds like what i want to do
2011-02-21T08:06:36  <XCulver> o
2011-02-21T08:06:42  <XCulver> i'm loading it into vs08 right now
2011-02-21T08:06:51  <AutomatedTester> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fdotnet%2Ftest%2FWebDriver.Common.Tests%253Fstate%253Dclosed
2011-02-21T08:07:23  <AutomatedTester> so in environmnet we do all the config reading
2011-02-21T08:07:30  <AutomatedTester> environment/ even
2011-02-21T08:07:59  <AutomatedTester> there is a EnvironmentManager.cs file there
2011-02-21T08:08:29  <AutomatedTester> Then all our tests inherit from http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/dotnet/test/WebDriver.Common.Tests/DriverTestFixture.cs
2011-02-21T08:08:42  <AutomatedTester> and that gives us access to the driver
2011-02-21T08:08:53  <XCulver> perfect
2011-02-21T08:09:10  <AutomatedTester> it *should* simplify things for you
2011-02-21T08:09:18  <XCulver> its definately what i'm looking for
2011-02-21T08:09:31  <XCulver> i'm creating an internal framework for porting from project to project
2011-02-21T08:09:40  <AutomatedTester> cool
2011-02-21T08:09:56  <XCulver> thanks for the help
2011-02-21T08:10:02  <XCulver> this will be some reading for a while
2011-02-21T08:10:03  <AutomatedTester> XCulver: Jim had a big hand in getting that done so if you see him online ask him about it
2011-02-21T08:10:07  <XCulver> yah
2011-02-21T08:10:17  <XCulver> i know hes the .net guy around here
2011-02-21T08:10:31  <XCulver> oh
2011-02-21T08:10:35  <AutomatedTester> Jim is the new Chuck Norris :D
2011-02-21T08:10:38  <XCulver> haha
2011-02-21T08:10:41  <XCulver> for sure
2011-02-21T08:10:52  <XCulver> you got time for a question about the conference?
2011-02-21T08:11:03  <AutomatedTester> i dont know much about it but shoot
2011-02-21T08:11:23  <XCulver> our shop does almost all ms web dev
2011-02-21T08:11:57  <XCulver> i'm wondering how much .net will be involved in the conference
2011-02-21T08:12:14  <XCulver> i know there are speakers and shops that are pretty generic
2011-02-21T08:12:24  <AutomatedTester> XCulver: not sure how much will be there for .NET
2011-02-21T08:12:39  <XCulver> kk, who should i talk to about that?
2011-02-21T08:12:54  <AutomatedTester> but since we are trying to give people a way of doing the same thing in any language you will still learn stuff
2011-02-21T08:12:55  <XCulver> i will try to convice my company to sponser me to go if i feel its worth it
2011-02-21T08:13:17  <XCulver> that makes sense
2011-02-21T08:13:41  <AutomatedTester> i know one talk is in Java but the guy is a Mozillian like me and we dont use Java
2011-02-21T08:14:14  <AutomatedTester> and java /c# is pretty close
2011-02-21T08:14:17  <XCulver> how about knowledge level wise?
2011-02-21T08:14:23  <XCulver> i'm entry level here
2011-02-21T08:14:29  <AutomatedTester> its being targeted at people of all levels
2011-02-21T08:15:50  <XCulver> ok
2011-02-21T08:16:04  <AutomatedTester> XCulver: a large number of committers are going so there will be people around to answer any questions
2011-02-21T08:16:12  <XCulver> i saw that
2011-02-21T08:16:16  <XCulver> its why i would love to go
2011-02-21T08:16:48  <XCulver> i didnt see you on the list
2011-02-21T08:17:12  <XCulver> is there a date for the schedule release?
2011-02-21T08:17:30  <AutomatedTester> I think all the speakers have been announced

2011-02-21T09:59:03  <AutomatedTester> XCulver: they are in the driver tests
2011-02-21T09:59:19  <AutomatedTester> same folder as the .nunit file
2011-02-21T09:59:30  <jimevans> In other words, the WebDriver.IE.Tests.config file is in WebDriver.IE.Tests directory.
2011-02-21T09:59:46  <XCulver> ok
2011-02-21T09:59:53  <jimevans> The project copies these files to the build output directory when run from within Visual Studio.
2011-02-21T10:00:29  <AutomatedTester> XCulver: it also gets around Class libraries not being able to read app.config
2011-02-21T10:00:51  <XCulver> we do the same thing here

2011-02-21T11:32:02  <jimevans> KirillJacobson: All other methods of launching IE are suboptimal. You will run into challenges with UAC and mandatory integrity levels on Vista and higher.
2011-02-21T11:32:52  <jimevans> believe me, if I could use CoCreateObject and expect it to work, I would.
2011-02-21T11:33:42  <jimevans> However, using CoCreateObject for the IE application will always merge sessions with existing browser sessions, making multiple independent instances of the driver impossible.
2011-02-21T11:34:49  <jimevans> I've been round and round about this trying to figure out the best way to launch IE, and I'll allow that I may have missed something (so you're welcome to keep looking), but I don't think I have.

2011-02-21T11:50:20  <jimevans> Microsoft pretty much killed the ability of developers to usefully automated IE with mandatory integrity levels in Vista and IE7

2011-02-21T12:10:21  <KirillJacobson> To jimevans: how do you run java unit tests? Is it from eclipse or the build file? I don't know rake so I ran junit tests from eclipse. I have tried to run with the latest pre-built dll (rev:11497) and got GPE in iedriver 0387fbb8 (in case you have a map file) ysomewhere below _InternalCallWinProc

2011-02-21T12:18:07  <jimevans> KirillJacobson: I run them using the build system. "go //java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/ie:test:run".

2011-02-21T12:20:36  <jimevans> I don't even have eclipse installed, so I use the go.bat file checked into the root of the project.
