2011-07-22T05:51:59  <ner0x> I'm using as to why rc $sel->type( $target, $text ); doesn't change the focus?
2011-07-22T05:52:30  <simonstewart> type just sets the value
2011-07-22T05:52:48  <ner0x> Right, but if it's to simulate a user, wouldn't it change the focus as well?
2011-07-22T05:53:02  <simonstewart> Selenium RC doesn't simulate a user that well
2011-07-22T05:53:17  <simonstewart> (though I can read the source: it might be trying to set the focus)
2011-07-22T05:53:32  <simonstewart> There's a known issue where firefox won't set focus if it's not the foremost window
2011-07-22T05:53:42  <ner0x> google-chrome
2011-07-22T05:53:52  <simonstewart> Try using the webdriver apis instead
2011-07-22T05:53:58  <simonstewart> They support chrome a lot better

2011-07-22T05:55:08  <simonstewart> I've been one of the few that's actually gone into the selenium core code recently
2011-07-22T05:55:30  <ner0x> perl probably doesn't have support for it yet.
2011-07-22T05:55:47  <simonstewart> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/
2011-07-22T05:55:55  <simonstewart> There's a project for perl bindings linked to from there
2011-07-22T05:56:00  <simonstewart> https://github.com/aivaturi/Selenium-Remote-Driver
2011-07-22T05:56:06  <simonstewart> I have no idea how good they are
2011-07-22T05:59:50  <ner0x> Not as good as the ones on CPAN yet.
2011-07-22T06:00:06  <ner0x> I'm going to stick to the old ways for now.
2011-07-22T06:00:20  <ner0x> Unfortunatley, seems like the only option I have.

2011-07-22T06:03:04  <simonstewart> I'm not going to be deleting it, but I'm not investing much energy in improving it
2011-07-22T06:03:25  <simonstewart> Basically, it's now frozen, though we'll make an effort to get it working on new browsers as they're released
2011-07-22T06:03:39  <ner0x> That's all I really need anyway.
2011-07-22T06:03:55  <ner0x> When I have a team I'll make them port it over. :-)
2011-07-22T06:04:04  <simonstewart> Also, we're always happy for people to send patches to improve things :)
2011-07-22T06:04:24  <ner0x> I'd only be able to help on the perl side of things.
2011-07-22T06:04:47  <simonstewart> The author of the perl bindings might like some help too. Or, at least, to know that someone's looking at them

2011-07-22T06:42:40  <Parabola> in the IDE, you can export JUnit 4 (webdriver) then theres another that says (Webdriver backed)
2011-07-22T06:42:42  <Parabola> whats the difference
2011-07-22T06:42:56  <simonstewart> webdriver is the new api
2011-07-22T06:43:07  <simonstewart> the webdriver-backed one is for teams who are migrating from the original selenium apis
2011-07-22T06:43:41  <ner0x> simonstewart: Where can I learn more about the "WebDriver" over "RC" ?
2011-07-22T06:43:51  <ner0x> To be honest, I don't know much of a difference.

2011-07-22T08:25:43  <jimevans> to publish a package to their repository, we need an account and API key from nuget.org.
2011-07-22T08:26:06  <jimevans> what's the procedure for setting those up for the project, and who should hold that info (i'm not sure it should be public)

2011-07-22T08:27:03  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: python does unicorns
2011-07-22T08:27:14  <jimevans> that's it. next programming language i create will have a "unicorn" data type.

2011-07-22T08:28:06  <jimevans> not often, but i've done it for internal use.
2011-07-22T08:29:01  <jimevans> what started out as a DSL for testing one of our applications developed into a full-fledged interpreted language with control structures, procedures, and everything.

2011-07-22T11:08:24  <tunabum> there's also driver.getPageSource()  but that will give you all the script and css and other stuff, not just the visible text (like the before mention does)

2011-07-22T13:42:49  <jimevans> Of course, there's a caveat to that. Certain document modes can cause document.querySelector() to not be available, in which case, we inject sizzle.

2011-07-22T14:03:44  <ruel> 2 unit tests?

2011-07-22T14:11:00  <new2b2> the function gets an xpath to a field, and then figures out what type of field it is and fills it out accordingly
2011-07-22T14:11:28  <ruel> can't you just pass the session id a an argument to your functions?
2011-07-22T14:11:46  <new2b2> yes, that's what i'm trying to figure out actually
2011-07-22T14:11:52  <new2b2> where is the sessionid that i need

2011-07-22T14:13:22  <new2b2> what's driver instance?

2011-07-22T14:14:39  <jimevans> i don't know the python syntax, but in java, somewhere you have to do WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); (or InternetExplorerDriver, or ChromeDriver, etc.)
2011-07-22T14:15:34  <new2b2> that will create another instance no? so if i send a selenium command it will go to a different browser?
2011-07-22T14:16:01  <jimevans> no, you've already done that somewhere, right? you have an instance of the driver?
2011-07-22T14:16:18  <new2b2> yes the initial instance that started in file1
2011-07-22T14:16:29  <jimevans> okay, that instance is stored in a variable, right?

2011-07-22T22:20:43  <chx> hi. if i try browser = webdriver.chrome() then i get TypeError: 'module' object is not callable webdriver.Firefox() works well.
2011-07-22T22:20:50  <chx> Selenium 2.1, Python 2.7
2011-07-22T22:21:18  <chx> I have chromedriver running and google-chrome is in /usr/bin
2011-07-22T22:22:04  <chx> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver this page has approximately nothing on Python
2011-07-22T22:24:08  <chx> Nevermind. it's browser.Chrome() and chromedriver needs to be in plce not running.
