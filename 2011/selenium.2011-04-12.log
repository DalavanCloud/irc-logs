2011-04-12T06:20:57  <jarib> nirvdrum: cool. i tried running it but it doesn't recognize the default firefox capabilities from the ruby client (webdriver)
2011-04-12T06:21:28  <nirvdrum> lvog reported the same thing.  I'm waiting for Francois to weigh in.
2011-04-12T06:22:00  <freynaud> Hello
2011-04-12T06:22:01  <jarib> ok
2011-04-12T06:22:18  <freynaud> what's the default capability from Ruby ?
2011-04-12T06:22:23  <jarib> let's see
2011-04-12T06:22:28  <freynaud> can you give me the json string it sends ?
2011-04-12T06:22:44  <jarib> yep
2011-04-12T06:23:21  <jarib> the error i get back is <title>Error 500 cannot find : {platform=ANY, javascriptEnabled=true, cssSelectorsEnabled=false, browserName=firefox, nativeEvents=false, rotatable=false, takesScreenshot=false, version=}</title>
2011-04-12T06:23:54  <jarib> i could fix the ruby client to send "correct" values for cssSelectorsEnabled, takesScreenshot etc
2011-04-12T06:24:12  <jarib> are you not doing the fuzzy matching that the standard webdriver server does?

2011-04-12T06:26:36  <jarib> freynaud: also would be nice if the server would report errors similar to how it's done in the wire protocol
2011-04-12T06:26:44  <jarib> i.e. json instead of text/html
2011-04-12T06:27:06  <freynaud> that's what ruby sends ?
2011-04-12T06:27:31  <freynaud> the desired capability from the jaba client are shorter
2011-04-12T06:27:49  <freynaud> only platform, browser and version

2011-04-12T06:30:19  *** Ivog has joined #selenium
2011-04-12T06:30:30  <freynaud> the logic doesn't work correctly. It checks all the param you send, and use that to find a node
2011-04-12T06:30:30  <jarib> freynaud: how do you deal with X displays in your grid setup?
2011-04-12T06:30:43  <jarib> right. the server just does "best match"
2011-04-12T06:30:51  <jarib> s/server/standard server
2011-04-12T06:31:08  <freynaud> for stuff like takeScreenshot, that doesn't make sense. takescreenshot = false, so it will try to find a node that cannot take screenshot. But if you use the augmenter, you can change it
2011-04-12T06:31:31  <freynaud> I need to find a way to only look at the not mutable properties
2011-04-12T06:33:03  <freynaud> i don't want the best match from the server
2011-04-12T06:33:20  <jarib> ok
2011-04-12T06:33:20  *** dereke__ has quit IRC
2011-04-12T06:33:34  *** dereke__ has joined #selenium
2011-04-12T06:33:36  <freynaud> if you ask for IE 7, and you only have an IE8 free, the grid should wait for the right version to be freed
2011-04-12T06:33:48  <jarib> ah
2011-04-12T06:34:23  <freynaud> we're just talking about the default implementation btw. If you want something specific that ignores version for IE for isntance, that's is something you can specify by implementing your custom listner
2011-04-12T06:34:36  <jarib> that makes sense
2011-04-12T06:35:01  <freynaud> The first implementation I had was using browser, version and OS for the matching
2011-04-12T06:35:27  <freynaud> I changed it because it's not really generic, but I may have to put it back to solve your issue
2011-04-12T06:37:45  *** sburjan has quit IRC
2011-04-12T06:39:44  <jarib> freynaud: it doesn't make sense for Capabilities.firefox() to not have the correct values for cssSelectors and takesScreenshot in ruby though
2011-04-12T06:40:31  <freynaud> takesScreenshot=false ?
2011-04-12T06:40:38  <freynaud> you cannot take screenshots ?
2011-04-12T06:40:57  <Ivog> freynaud: i'm getting a capability not present on grid exception any pointers?
2011-04-12T06:40:57  <jarib> i definitely can, it's sending the wrong capability
2011-04-12T06:41:05  <jarib> Ivog: what language?
2011-04-12T06:41:27  <jarib> freynaud: i'll just fix this on the ruby side, if that solves my problem your matching may be fine
2011-04-12T06:41:38  <Ivog> C#
2011-04-12T06:41:54  <freynaud> jarib: it doesn't solve the issue properly
2011-04-12T06:42:16  <freynaud> jarib: some of the properties can be changed during the test.
2011-04-12T06:42:32  <jarib> really?
2011-04-12T06:42:42  <jarib> ah, the augmenter
2011-04-12T06:42:45  <freynaud> jarib: I think I'll go back to a list of properties to check for the matching
2011-04-12T06:42:45  <jarib> right
2011-04-12T06:43:07  <freynaud> ideally, we need 2 things for desiredCapabilities
2011-04-12T06:43:15  <freynaud> 3 maybe
2011-04-12T06:43:20  <freynaud> what is mutable
2011-04-12T06:43:21  <freynaud> what isn't
2011-04-12T06:43:27  <freynaud> and what is config
2011-04-12T06:43:34  <jarib> if i want a pristine X display for each browser instance, would i do it with a custom listener?
2011-04-12T06:43:45  <freynaud> config being the firefox profile for instnace.
2011-04-12T06:44:11  <freynaud> i don't think you need a listener for that
2011-04-12T06:44:26  <jarib> how would you do it?
2011-04-12T06:44:28  <freynaud> you basically want a max of 1 test at a time per X display right ?
2011-04-12T06:45:18  <jarib> yes
2011-04-12T06:46:15  <freynaud> you have 2 things per remote
2011-04-12T06:46:38  <freynaud> 1- the list of browsers supporter, for instance firefox, firefox, firefox, IE,chrome
2011-04-12T06:46:50  <freynaud> the second is the max concurrent browser at a time
2011-04-12T06:47:04  <freynaud> if you set that to 1, you will never have more than 1 browser per remote
2011-04-12T06:47:10  <jarib> aha
2011-04-12T06:47:25  <jarib> right, so i'd need a remote server per X display
2011-04-12T06:47:48  <freynaud> if you want 1 remote for N display
2011-04-12T06:48:24  *** andytinkham has joined #selenium

2011-04-12T06:49:27  <jarib> what's the name of the listener interface?
2011-04-12T06:49:29  <freynaud> probably TestListener. BeforeTest/AfterTest reserve / release a display
2011-04-12T06:50:02  <freynaud> and in the getNewSession, you do the display management

2011-04-12T07:51:07  <samueladesoga> Hi guys, at work we are trying to migrate our test scripts from selenium1 to selenium2. Our test run on ubuntu machines and the developers have done some work to allows us run our test simultanously on the same machine using the firefox browser. Basically we annotate tests with @multithreaded but with selenium2 thsi doesnt work i believe because the firefox browser is confused regarding focus issues, any advice ih house?
2011-04-12T07:55:23  <jarib> samueladesoga: you can try FirefoxProfile.setAlwaysLoadNoFocusLib(true)
2011-04-12T07:55:34  <jarib> though having a separate display for each instance is preferred
2011-04-12T07:55:50  <samueladesoga> we have tried that and it still doesnt work
2011-04-12T07:56:35  *** QAguy has joined #selenium
2011-04-12T07:56:39  <jarib> then i'd look into launching a separate X display per instance
2011-04-12T07:56:48  <samueladesoga> that is what we are looking into right now
2011-04-12T07:56:56  <jarib> then you're on the right path :)
2011-04-12T07:57:03  <samueladesoga> buit it looks painful
2011-04-12T07:58:31  <jarib> what language are you working in?
2011-04-12T07:58:40  <samueladesoga> java
2011-04-12T08:00:38  <jarib> ok, no idea then
2011-04-12T08:01:35  <samueladesoga> is there a better way to do this in ruby as i know you are a ruby person, i have used the headless gem in the past
2011-04-12T08:01:58  *** AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
2011-04-12T08:03:08  <jarib> samueladesoga: i know it's easier to propogate env vars to child processes
2011-04-12T08:03:47  <jarib> i made this to do it for our scenario https://github.com/jarib/cukeforker
2011-04-12T08:04:48  <jarib> well, the actual code to launch displays is here https://github.com/jarib/vnctools
2011-04-12T08:04:58  <jarib> but this probably won't be very helpful in java.
2011-04-12T08:05:05  <samueladesoga> okay thanks would have a look at these stuff
2011-04-12T08:05:27  <jarib> the headless gem is pretty simple and provides much of the same thing
2011-04-12T08:05:32  <samueladesoga> maybe not for this stuff
2011-04-12T08:06:10  <jarib> you probably want to ask simon about this when he's around
2011-04-12T08:08:20  <samueladesoga> okay thanks Jarib , would be on the look out for simon

2011-04-12T08:15:56  <skiphuffman_> Quick Question.  Does selenium RC support Firefox 4?
2011-04-12T08:16:13  <skiphuffman_> If not, I can stop beating my head against the wall and be patient.
2011-04-12T08:16:25  <skiphuffman_> How about IE 9?
2011-04-12T08:18:09  <AutomatedTester> skiphuffman_: our tests have shown it does work

2011-04-12T08:18:38  <samueladesoga> Yes selenium RC supports firefox 4
2011-04-12T08:19:16  <skiphuffman_> Ok, I will keep thrashing on it.
2011-04-12T08:19:21  <samueladesoga> I am not sure what the current selenum-server.jar looks like
2011-04-12T08:19:30  <samueladesoga> but i had to change some manifest files
2011-04-12T08:19:35  <samueladesoga> in our jar file
2011-04-12T08:19:47  <samueladesoga> so that the max version was Firefox 4
2011-04-12T08:20:01  <skiphuffman_> Oh, was that answer based on beta 3?
2011-04-12T08:20:05  <skiphuffman_> I think I have beta 2
2011-04-12T08:20:53  <samueladesoga> what error message do you see on the console?
2011-04-12T08:23:09  <skiphuffman_> "Preparing Firefox profile..." \n "Launching Firefox..." \n
2011-04-12T08:23:27  <skiphuffman_> Firefox window is open, but nothing is happening.
2011-04-12T08:24:31  <samueladesoga> Can you send some test code of how you have started up the browser?
2011-04-12T08:24:47  <dereke__> jarib: even with native events set to false it doesn't work, that is not actually part of the firefox profile

2011-04-12T08:27:23  <samueladesoga> i had to do similar stuff to what is on the blog
2011-04-12T08:27:45  <jarib> dereke__: it does set a profile preference for native events
2011-04-12T08:28:11  <jarib> dereke__: try both .native_events = false and .load_no_focus_lib = false
2011-04-12T08:28:30  <samueladesoga> i am going to try as suggested by dereke
2011-04-12T08:28:31  <samueladesoga> now

2011-04-12T08:40:16  <AutomatedTester> there are around 50 IE bugs and I would say at least 70% of them are "NeedsClarification" because they were before jimevans rewrote the stuff
2011-04-12T08:40:39  <jarib> yeah
2011-04-12T08:40:47  <jimevans> yeah

2011-04-12T08:41:38  <jimevans> some of those even have comments for the reporter to retry the test, but that was before we were using NeedsClarification
2011-04-12T08:42:28  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: yup but it means that when we release the next time I can go through and close those one straight away and the proper needs clarification can sit in a holding pattern
2011-04-12T08:45:29  <jarib> dereke__: right. well no one execpt you actually passes the profile across the wire :)

2011-04-12T08:47:39  <dereke__> I think it makes more sense for it to be part of the capabilities than the profile, presumably native events will be a cross browser thing right?

2011-04-12T08:52:41  <freynaud> AutomatedTester: in a grid envt, something good would be to have 2 modes. 1, the addon is sent over the wire together with the desiredCapability. 2, , firefox_profile="some path local to where the gird is"

2011-04-12T08:55:43  <dereke__> jarib: because then I will have to do that for everyone else as well :)

2011-04-12T08:55:57  <freynaud> jarib: no, the html of the page to upload is slightly over engineered and webdriver gets confused
2011-04-12T08:56:16  <AutomatedTester> cgoldberg: if you using the RemoteWebDriver you have access to HtmlUnit
2011-04-12T08:56:27  <jarib> cgoldberg: hudson also has a nice xvfb plugin
2011-04-12T08:56:47  <jarib> so it will launch/kill a fake X display before and after your test

2011-04-12T08:57:28  <freynaud> jarib: the html is the problem, not 594. I cannot interact with the input where the file path is suppose to go
2011-04-12T08:57:39  <cgoldberg> jarib, is that how most people run selenium on a CI/server system?  using xvfb?
2011-04-12T08:58:05  <jarib> freynaud: right, i've had to work around hidden file fields as well (using executeScript...)

2011-04-12T10:00:00  <skiphuffman_> Good.  Is it a drop in replacement for 1.0.8?
2011-04-12T10:00:26  <skiphuffman_> It doesn't look the same.
2011-04-12T10:02:01  <skiphuffman_> I don't see a build.xml for one thing
2011-04-12T10:04:22  <nirvdrum> 2.0b3 does not support grid 1.0.8 backwards-compatibility.  For that you will need to follow the instructions in the email to the dev list I sent out yesterday.
2011-04-12T10:05:00  *** andytinkham has joined #selenium
2011-04-12T10:05:27  <cgoldberg> skiphuffman_, why do you need to build?  usually the setup goes like this:  download the standalone jar... run it... download the latest bindings.. run them pointing at the server (or alternately, use the newest bindings that don't require the server)
2011-04-12T10:05:29  <skiphuffman_> Ok, I am not on the dev list.  Is it archived somewhere?
2011-04-12T10:06:09  <nirvdrum> skiphuffman_: Yeah.  It's all Google Groups.
2011-04-12T10:06:10  <skiphuffman_> @cgoldberg, I am not trying to build.  Build.xml is used by ANT to start the remote control session
2011-04-12T10:06:23  <nirvdrum> Attempting to run grid 2.0 without being on the dev list is almost certainly going to lead to frustration.
2011-04-12T10:06:38  <nirvdrum> Particularly I outlined what will and will not work.
2011-04-12T10:07:05  <cgoldberg> skiphuffman_, ah gotcha.  you might want to start in small pieces (starting the server manually, etc) rather than using ANT until your sorted out

2011-04-12T10:07:57  <skiphuffman_> That is fine by me.  is there a set of instructions that does not use ANT.  I only use ANT because it was specified.

2011-04-12T10:09:29  <cgoldberg> skiphuffman_, do you know how to call your client (RC) code without ANT?
2011-04-12T10:10:00  <cgoldberg> skiphuffman_, i meant which RC bindings are you using (python, java, ruby, etc)
2011-04-12T10:10:23  <skiphuffman_> Oh, sorry.  my tests are in python
2011-04-12T10:10:38  <skiphuffman_> No, I do not know how to call the RC without ANT.
2011-04-12T10:10:56  <skiphuffman_> I didn't know it was possible without ANT.
2011-04-12T10:11:01  <sfbrian> use nose or py.test
2011-04-12T10:11:06  <cgoldberg> skiphuffman_, ok great.  so.. if you use the latest bindings, you can forget all about the Java server.. the new bindings can control your browser directly
2011-04-12T10:12:11  <cgoldberg> skiphuffman_, although i dunno how that works in a grid setup.. you prob DO need the server
2011-04-12T10:12:44  <sfbrian> I think you still need a server for grid even with the new bindings
2011-04-12T10:13:16  <cgoldberg> skiphuffman_, anyways.. you need to know how to start your client code.. then all you do is run the server "java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar"
2011-04-12T10:13:31  <cgoldberg> skiphuffman_, and aim your client code at it locally
2011-04-12T10:13:43  <skiphuffman_> Ok, I guess I need to back off and replan this project
2011-04-12T10:13:53  <nirvdrum> skiphuffman_: Check out the dev list.  I gave the exact command you'd need to run the hub there.  The thread is "Grid 2 testers" and was started yesterday.
2011-04-12T10:14:08  <skiphuffman_> I am trying to find the dev list as we speak
2011-04-12T10:14:44  <skiphuffman_> Ah found it

2011-04-12T10:17:04  <cgoldberg> skiphuffman_, my suggestion is to start small.. get the server running.. attach the bindings.. move to remote.. move to grid...
2011-04-12T10:17:05  <skiphuffman_> I thought the upgrade would be more straightforward.

2011-04-12T10:20:50  <nirvdrum> skiphuffman_: You don't.  If you're happy with grid 1.0.8 and you want support for those browsers, just swap out the selenium-server-1.0.3-standalone.jar in the vendor folder with the 2.0beta3 release.
2011-04-12T10:21:09  <nirvdrum> You would need to do that whether you wanted to use the grid 1 hub or the grid 2 hub anyway.
2011-04-12T10:21:24  <nirvdrum> Since the node is really what determines the browsers supported.3
2011-04-12T10:22:14  <skiphuffman_> Ok, so I should be able to just swap out the vendor folder .jar file?
2011-04-12T10:22:21  <nirvdrum> Yes.

2011-04-12T10:22:37  <nirvdrum> np
2011-04-12T10:22:58  <nirvdrum> I think you can just delete the old JAR and shove the new one in.  At one point though it needed to have the same name.
2011-04-12T10:23:15  <nirvdrum> So, if it doesn't work, rename it to the old JAR name (with the 1.0.3 in the filename)

2011-04-12T11:55:42  <AutomatedTester> complicated in that it cant be public?

2011-04-12T11:57:11  <AutomatedTester> jarib: simonstewart and I were discussing this issue with a few people on Friday in the Mozilla offices
2011-04-12T11:57:28  <jarib> that's a bit overengineered since i was trying to demonstrate the loadablecomponent thing

2011-04-12T11:59:23  <AutomatedTester> ah
2011-04-12T11:59:42  <AutomatedTester> i remember him saying he hit an issue but since it was ruby I just redirected
2011-04-12T12:00:24  <AutomatedTester> so jarib the issue is that the innerWIndow and the outerWIndow lose track of each other
2011-04-12T12:00:30  <AutomatedTester> they do resync
2011-04-12T12:00:43  <AutomatedTester> but thats the cause
2011-04-12T12:00:46  <jarib> i see
2011-04-12T12:01:05  <AutomatedTester> it was the cause of the Se1 tests on Fx4 failing
2011-04-12T12:01:16  <jarib> aha
2011-04-12T12:01:20  <jarib> so how did we solve it in Se1?
2011-04-12T12:01:27  <AutomatedTester> hacked it
2011-04-12T12:01:34  <AutomatedTester> in a nasty way
2011-04-12T12:01:36  <jarib> ah, i remember you discussed it here

2011-04-12T12:14:53  <QAguy> jarib: Awesome. Very fast. But am experience an issue with it that I'm investigating. it seem the issue is that is a button is displayed but not above the folder, a click action happens but doesn't do anything. I'm trying to verify that is tha case with one of my devs now
2011-04-12T12:15:16  <jarib> above the fold, you mean?
2011-04-12T12:15:30  <jarib> it should scroll the element into view
2011-04-12T12:15:31  <QAguy> yes sorry
2011-04-12T12:15:45  <jarib> i think i reported an issue about this that was fixed
2011-04-12T12:16:31  <QAguy> well I'm using driver.execute_script("window.jquery().click()") due to the fact tha .click in doesn't seem to work in IE but this version does
2011-04-12T12:17:06  <QAguy> jimevans thinks that jQuery and IE driver might not play nice
2011-04-12T12:17:17  <QAguy> sites that use jQuery that is
2011-04-12T12:17:24  <QAguy> another things I'm checking on
2011-04-12T12:17:52  <jimevans> QAguy: we had some recent changes in the atoms that i think fixed the jquery conflicts.

2011-04-12T12:26:17  <QAguy> jarib: So that is definitely the problem with excute script. My JS guy gave me a function that I added in to my script to may the button I want to click fully visible on the page before clicking and that fixed the test.
2011-04-12T12:26:33  <QAguy> I'm going to check it the normal click method works without that
2011-04-12T12:26:44  <QAguy> to make*
2011-04-12T12:27:09  <QAguy> So seem like a clicking issue with elements below the fold.
2011-04-12T12:28:19  <jarib> i wouldn't consider it webdriver's problem if you're calling jquery's click()
2011-04-12T12:31:51  <QAguy> jarib: You are probably correct. My workaround is good enough but if the IE driver not properly works with the webdriver .click method and I just change to that. But I want to see if the straight .click works in chrome.
2011-04-12T12:32:15  <QAguy> now*
2011-04-12T12:32:23  * QAguy needs to take a typing course
2011-04-12T12:33:21  <jarib> you could also build the gem from trunk to see if it fixes your ie issue

2011-04-12T13:01:39  *** True_Blue has joined #selenium
2011-04-12T13:02:37  <True_Blue> Do any of you use PageObjects without using PageFactory.  Right now, I am doing so, and was wondering if others do the same.  The elements are not grabbed until the person calls the appropriate getter method
2011-04-12T13:03:14  <andytinkham1> True_Blue: Sounds similar to mine. I don't use PageFactory. I also don't have getters for my elements, but I don't find the element until I interact with it
2011-04-12T13:03:28  <True_Blue> ahh ok
2011-04-12T13:03:32  <True_Blue> I found with dynamic data
2011-04-12T13:03:36  <True_Blue> its harder to use PageFactory
2011-04-12T13:03:54  <True_Blue> How do you call the elements?
2011-04-12T13:04:04  <True_Blue> I use things like page.getOrangeHeaderText()
2011-04-12T13:04:04  <True_Blue> etc
2011-04-12T13:04:21  <QAguy> jarib: That doesn't work :(
2011-04-12T13:04:40  <jarib> in what way does it not work?
2011-04-12T13:04:45  <andytinkham1> All of my PageObjects just provide a public interface to the tasks a user would say they were doing on a page.  Those methods encapsulate all the control interaction - my page objects are the only things that ever know about any specific elements
2011-04-12T13:04:47  *** jimevans has joined #selenium
2011-04-12T13:05:41  <True_Blue> ahh I see.  I ave custom methods in my PageObjects to do things like fill out forms and such, and then I have getters to grab text so I can compare it in my asserts
2011-04-12T13:06:41  <andytinkham1> Makes sense. Rather than having a getter, I'll likely just provide a verify method that just takes the expected value and returns true or false
2011-04-12T13:06:50  <QAguy> If we have a question that is really long the button to click is potentially way down the page. In that case that function is moving that button up to the bottom of the page (i.e. into view) but we have an overlap (try) at the bottom of the screen that when clicked scolls up. That is obscuring the button so its not getting clicked. The scoll function is not taking into account that overlay
2011-04-12T13:06:55  <True_Blue> ahh
2011-04-12T13:07:16  <True_Blue> something like page.checkText(element, expected_text)?
2011-04-12T13:07:48  <andytinkham1> more like page.verifyHeaderText(expected_text) probably
2011-04-12T13:07:56  <True_Blue> Ahh I see
2011-04-12T13:08:22  <QAguy> jarib: ^^ that make sense
2011-04-12T13:08:27  <True_Blue> It sounds very similar, just a little different
2011-04-12T13:09:11  <jarib> QAguy: interesting. so you're saying a user would scroll further to be able to click the button
2011-04-12T13:09:17  <True_Blue> Do you create click methods for each link?  Since clicking a link will return a different PageObject, most links need a click method
2011-04-12T13:09:18  *** skiphuffman_ has quit IRC
2011-04-12T13:09:18  <andytinkham1> Haven't done a lot of that sort of verification though - most of my thinking around that has been more in terms of verifying user actions. I also might not even provide a public method for the verification and just incorporate the check wherever it most makes sense in doing those actions
2011-04-12T13:10:03  <True_Blue> Right now I have things like, clickReviseLink, clickInfoLink, etc
2011-04-12T13:10:09  <True_Blue> Which all return different Page Objects
2011-04-12T13:10:14  <True_Blue> depending upon where they take the user
2011-04-12T13:10:23  <andytinkham1> True_Blue: Essentially, but my functions are described in user tasks so generally my click functions have more than just a click
2011-04-12T13:10:25  <QAguy> jarib: yes
2011-04-12T13:10:48  <QAguy> when I try to click it manually when the function places it I cannot click it
2011-04-12T13:10:52  <QAguy> where*
2011-04-12T13:10:53  <True_Blue> ahh that makes sense
2011-04-12T13:10:56  <andytinkham1> For your example, I might have methods like ReviseThingy, GetInfoForThingy (where Thingy is whatever the item actually is)
2011-04-12T13:11:09  <True_Blue> Usually within my tests, I go through each link on a page and make sure they take the user to the correct page
2011-04-12T13:11:23  <jarib> QAguy: some future APIs will allow you to move the mouse to an element with a given offset, which may solve it
2011-04-12T13:11:29  <andytinkham1> Then, maybe those methods click links, but the fact that they're links is still encapsulated in the page object and nothing else knows what's involved in revising or getting info
2011-04-12T13:11:39  <jarib> QAguy: for now you'll need to scroll the window into the right position using JS though
2011-04-12T13:11:48  <jarib> then you should be able to click it through webdriver's click
2011-04-12T13:11:49  <andytinkham1> Yeah, that level of test is a different level than what I'm focusing on now
2011-04-12T13:11:58  <True_Blue> yeah

2011-04-12T13:15:51  <andytinkham1> At the moment, I've got a function called 'ensure_ready' that checks the URL. I'm looking at jarib's tweet code from #seconf now to see if the LoadableComponent pattern he used is significantly different than what I do, and if so, whether switching would benefit me at all
2011-04-12T13:15:59  *** Ivog has quit IRC
2011-04-12T13:16:28  <andytinkham1> (ensure_ready is called at the beginning of each public method in the page object right now, which means we have to remember to call it)
2011-04-12T13:17:30  <jarib> andytinkham1: let me know what you think about loadablecomponent :)
2011-04-12T13:18:06  <jarib> it's obviously not a great fit for the tweet example, since that's just two pages
2011-04-12T13:19:08  <andytinkham1> jarib: Will do. I like the idea, I'm just trying to figure out if it's similar to what I do or not :) (And I understand about the tweet example - I'm trying to make mine mimic the whole architecture I described in my talk which is definitely overkill for this simple example)
2011-04-12T13:19:21  <True_Blue> ahh that makes sense
2011-04-12T13:19:28  <True_Blue> It throws an Exception if it is not?

2011-04-12T13:20:36  <andytinkham1> And my ensure_ready doesn't throw an exception currently (though it probably should). Right now, it just tries to load the right page
2011-04-12T13:20:46  <jarib> andytinkham1: the main difference is that a given page knows how to tell its parent (previous) page how to get to itself
2011-04-12T13:21:08  <jarib> and it does that by sending a message - so those interfaces/protocols become important
2011-04-12T13:21:08  <andytinkham1> Which is annoying when my expected URL doesn't contain parameters and the actual URL does
2011-04-12T13:21:18  <jarib> well, that's at least the main difference from how i've done things in the past
2011-04-12T13:21:28  <andytinkham1> jarib: That's definitely not something I have - why would a page need to know how to get to its parent?

2011-04-12T13:29:23  <True_Blue> That makes sense.  My suites are already Page focuses, so I have a suite of tests for each page

2011-04-12T13:34:16  <andytinkham1> jarib: I think I'm seeing how LoadableComponent works. It seems like I'd define the majority of my application to have the login page as it's parent, so that trying to go to any of those pages will make sure that I'm logged in first
2011-04-12T13:36:58  *** charleyb has joined #selenium
2011-04-12T13:38:33  <True_Blue> Do you have a link with LoadableComponent?
2011-04-12T13:39:18  <andytinkham1> True_Blue: jarib's tweet code is here (https://gist.github.com/904503) and that has a link in the top comments to more writeup
2011-04-12T13:40:32  <jarib> andytinkham1: so the nice thing is you can model a workflow by composing a tree of objects
2011-04-12T13:40:54  <jarib> and you can swap in different implementations of a part of the workflow
2011-04-12T13:41:51  <jarib> so say, a login page could be replaced by an object with the same interface but which logs in through an API and sets a cookie appropriately
2011-04-12T13:42:57  <jarib> True_Blue: your getHere() corresponds to get() in LoadableComponent
2011-04-12T13:43:06  <True_Blue> ahh
2011-04-12T13:43:08  <True_Blue> It looks nice
2011-04-12T13:43:12  <True_Blue> What is this written in?
2011-04-12T13:43:14  <andytinkham1> jarib: Yeah, I can see how this would be useful. Still wrapping my mind around how to fit this into what I have. I really like having more structure than just a random collection of page objects like I have now
2011-04-12T13:43:16  <True_Blue> ruby?
2011-04-12T13:43:17  <jarib> that's ruby
2011-04-12T13:43:20  <True_Blue> I just saw the .rb
2011-04-12T13:43:21  <True_Blue> heh
2011-04-12T13:43:55  <jarib> andytinkham1: yeah, that's my challenge as well. esp. since cucumber in a sense forces a more procedural world view
2011-04-12T13:44:27  *** ivog has joined #selenium
2011-04-12T13:44:45  <jarib> i.e. if i did this in the ruby layer it would influence how the features are written
2011-04-12T13:45:45  <True_Blue> I have a very loose structure
2011-04-12T13:46:14  <andytinkham1> jarib: Meaning for example, that your scenarios wouldn't specify logging in since the page objects can automatically handle doing that?
2011-04-12T13:46:17  <True_Blue> Although I definitely could make mine tighter
2011-04-12T13:46:38  <jarib> andytinkham1: right, that sort of challenge
2011-04-12T13:46:55  <jarib> you could have Given steps that build up the tree
2011-04-12T13:47:19  <jarib> but that could get confusing as hell :)
2011-04-12T13:47:23  <True_Blue> I used to use WebRat a lot
2011-04-12T13:47:52  <andytinkham1> so, Given I am on the Foo page instead of Given I am logged in And I have navigated to the Bar page And I have navigated to the Foo page
2011-04-12T13:48:10  <andytinkham1> ?
2011-04-12T13:48:40  <jarib> right, but in some cases the state you're setting up is complicated and really warrants several steps in order to read nicely
2011-04-12T13:49:00  <andytinkham1> True_Blue: Did WebRat lead you towards the loose structure?
2011-04-12T13:49:11  <andytinkham1> jarib: Yeah, I Can see how that would be the case
2011-04-12T13:49:25  *** scrummy has left #selenium
2011-04-12T13:50:20  <True_Blue> Not really.  My loose structure is happening naturally because I do sometimes have several ways of getting to a page
2011-04-12T13:50:30  <True_Blue> So I dont just have a specific parent
2011-04-12T13:51:01  <True_Blue> While a lot of pages can only be gotten to by one way, a bunch of others can be gotten to through various means, so its hard for me to have a clear map
2011-04-12T13:51:17  <True_Blue> So its easier to just have more of them all sitting besides eachother, instead of top/down
2011-04-12T13:52:09  <andytinkham1> I should map out my pages and see where the connections are. Might make some things clearer
2011-04-12T13:52:10  <jarib> True_Blue: LoadableComponent still lets you do several ways of getting to a page, the set of "previous" pages just need to implement the same interface

2011-04-12T13:53:32  <True_Blue> andy: where do you define getCurrentUrl, back(), etc?  Right now, I have those housed in a DefaultPage, which my other pages extend

2011-04-12T13:54:59  <andytinkham1> I haven't yet defined back and for get current url, I just use the Selenium provided method. I have a base Page class though which the page objects extend which is where ensure_ready is defined
2011-04-12T13:55:44  <True_Blue> ahh
2011-04-12T13:56:41  <True_Blue> Do you have defined in ensure_ready the specific urls?

2011-04-12T13:57:01  <True_Blue> So if you build out a Search PageObject, you look for search.html?

2011-04-12T14:41:16  <XCulver> yup
2011-04-12T14:41:27  <XCulver> its running them from a msbuild.xml script
2011-04-12T14:41:30  <XCulver> using nunit
2011-04-12T14:41:38  <jimevans> did you change from compiling on x86 (or win32) to AnyCPU?
2011-04-12T14:42:02  <XCulver> should only be AnyCPU, but i'm going to double check
2011-04-12T14:42:46  <XCulver> according to visualStudio 2010 its AnyCPU
2011-04-12T14:42:56  <jimevans> if you're using Any CPU on x64, you should be getting 64-bit IE.
2011-04-12T14:43:08  <XCulver> it started using 32
2011-04-12T14:43:16  <XCulver> then something happend midway through the tests
2011-04-12T14:43:19  <XCulver> something failed
2011-04-12T14:43:21  <XCulver> and it went to 64
2011-04-12T14:43:28  <XCulver> and the tests just run bad in 64
2011-04-12T14:43:31  <True_Blue> andy: so in every method, you have ensure_ready?
2011-04-12T14:44:06  <jimevans> XCulver: if you want to force 32-bit execution, you need to be sure you're running with nunit-x86.
2011-04-12T14:44:36  <jimevans> the C# IE driver looks at the bit-ness it is running on, and starts the appropriate bit-ness browser.
2011-04-12T14:44:51  <jimevans> it *has* to, because we're using an unmanaged dll.
2011-04-12T14:45:04  <jimevans> you can't call a 32-bit dll from a 64-bit process and vice versa.
2011-04-12T14:45:23  <XCulver> ok
2011-04-12T14:45:47  <jimevans> if it switched, it switched because the launching process was a 64-bit process.
2011-04-12T14:45:49  <XCulver> i see were using the regular nunit-console.exe, i'll try switching to nunit-console-x86.exe for mine
2011-04-12T14:46:14  <jimevans> that's what it's there for. :)
2011-04-12T14:46:39  <XCulver> interesting i dont have near the problems running it through testrunner in visualstudio itself
2011-04-12T14:46:52  <XCulver> but when using a msbuild script its really problematic
2011-04-12T14:47:28  <jimevans> visual studio is a 32-bit application. maybe that has something to do with it.
2011-04-12T14:47:30  <XCulver> jimevans: thanks again for the advice. going to try it out
2011-04-12T14:47:52  <andytinkham1> True_Blue: Yeah, I do right now, but it feels kludgy to me since we have to always remember to include it when we write a new method. Still thinking about whether Jari's code might address this better.

2011-04-12T15:30:36  <freynaud> ivog: that should only happen if the connection between the hub and the remote is lost
2011-04-12T15:30:54  <freynaud> no, there is no such command.
2011-04-12T15:31:16  <ivog> freynaud: yea, now im trying to figure out how that could happen, it's happening constantly
2011-04-12T15:31:42  <freynaud> can you try to launch everything locally, just to make sure
2011-04-12T15:31:48  <ivog> freynaud: that works
2011-04-12T15:32:01  <ivog> it only happens with remote rc's
2011-04-12T15:32:12  <freynaud> how are you launching the rcs ?
2011-04-12T15:33:16  *** andytinkham1 has quit IRC
2011-04-12T15:33:17  <ivog> java -jar selenium-standalone.jar -role webdriver -hub http://huburl:4444/grid/register
2011-04-12T15:33:40  <freynaud> on the hub, you will have the remote url
2011-04-12T15:33:48  <ivog> ya
2011-04-12T15:33:49  <freynaud> there is probably a problem here
2011-04-12T15:34:09  <ivog> i see the rc's registered and like after a minute they become disconnected
2011-04-12T15:35:02  <ivog> i've looked at the code and it looks like isDown is true and isUp is false :) and it looks like isUp checks a status url on the remotedriver
2011-04-12T15:35:16  <ivog> but i wasn't able to open a browser and request that url
2011-04-12T15:36:56  <freynaud> the logic for that is in WebRemoteProxy.isAlive()
2011-04-12T15:37:55  <ivog> yea this part
2011-04-12T15:37:55  <ivog> getRemoteURL().toExternalForm() + "/status"
2011-04-12T15:38:18  <ivog> does that resolve to http://wdurl:5555/status?
2011-04-12T15:38:42  <davehunt> freynaud: So I have the hub and RC running, but when I fire tests the browsers do not launch. Eventually I get: WARNING: session 073c7022-ef6f-471c-beee-9c8faa4599ea (int. key, remote not contacted yet.) has TIMED OUT and will be released
2011-04-12T15:39:00  <ivog> i should just hookup a debugger but my java skills are so rusty :)
2011-04-12T15:39:25  <freynaud> ivog: i'm checking what's happening
2011-04-12T15:39:44  <ivog> thanks!

2011-04-12T15:44:22  <freynaud> davehunt: firefox crashes ?
2011-04-12T15:45:23  <freynaud> Ivog: can you reach the url of the remote ? Something like http://192.168.39.165:5555/wd
2011-04-12T15:45:40  <freynaud> Ivog: should return a 500
2011-04-12T15:45:46  <davehunt> freynaud: Firefox never launches. I'm not sure where it's getting the IP address from but it's not correct...
2011-04-12T15:48:06  <freynaud> daveHunt: the node IP ?
2011-04-12T15:48:17  <davehunt> yep
2011-04-12T15:48:27  <davehunt> looks like it's picking up my VPN tunnel IP
2011-04-12T15:49:08  <freynaud> if you're launching using -role rc , it's inSelfRegisteringWebDriver
2011-04-12T15:49:28  <freynaud> or selenium
2011-04-12T15:49:38  <freynaud> String ip = networkUtils.getIp4NonLoopbackAddressOfThisMachine().getHostAddress();
2011-04-12T15:49:44  <davehunt> I disconnected from the VPN and it works now
2011-04-12T15:49:48  <freynaud> that's not from grid, it's a selenium helper
2011-04-12T15:50:37  <davehunt> yeah
2011-04-12T15:51:16  <freynaud> so I guess I need -ip XXX optional, with the Loopback as a default
2011-04-12T15:51:22  <Ivog> freynaud: hmm looks like i can't probably some weird network problem then thx
2011-04-12T15:51:38  <davehunt> freynaud: I think it might be a good idea to be able to override the IP, yeah
2011-04-12T15:51:44  <davehunt> sweet - the tests passed!
2011-04-12T15:52:49  <davehunt> Before I can roll this out any further I will need to be able to specify specific versions of Firefox though
2011-04-12T15:52:57  <freynaud> Ivog: if the hub cannot reach the node, (cannot be reached at the moment) seems like an appropriate message :)
2011-04-12T15:53:32  <freynaud> davehunt: firefox is the only easy one I think
2011-04-12T15:53:37  <Ivog> Being able to specify an ip would probabaly also help me
2011-04-12T15:53:50  <freynaud> do you need to support multiple FF per machine ?
2011-04-12T15:53:56  <davehunt> freynaud: Ideally
2011-04-12T15:54:15  <freynaud> less easy
2011-04-12T15:54:50  <davehunt> So Grid 1.x does it by matching an environment name to a browser value of *firefox <path>
2011-04-12T15:55:19  <davehunt> All versions of Firefox can be preinstalled on the machines
2011-04-12T15:55:34  <davehunt> And we can ensure they are in a predictable location
2011-04-12T15:57:39  <davehunt> Right, I need to head to bed. Thanks for the assistance freynaud! :)
2011-04-12T15:58:02  <Ivog> Im working on 2 loadbalanced machines which share ipadresses
2011-04-12T15:59:20  <Ivog> Hub can access node by unique ip but shared ip is used during registering
2011-04-12T16:00:44  <Ivog> So i guess being able to specify an ip during registering would also help me

2011-04-12T19:06:59  <adamgoucher> so if people are bored, how would you convert xpath=//div[contains(@class, 'tabbertab') and not(contains(@class, 'tabbertabhide'))]/select to css?

2011-04-12T19:21:42  <adamgoucher> nope. i gave up after 20 minutes of futzing; a lone xpath in a sea of css isn't that bad
2011-04-12T19:26:10  <frohoff> interesting, that seems to work ok as a jquery selector, perhaps not supported by querySelectAll though
2011-04-12T19:30:30  <frohoff> actually, that structure seems to work ok in FF 3.6 native document.querySelectorAll()

2011-04-12T19:39:59  <frohoff> I might have gotten some nuance specific to your doc incorrect, I tested it with a similar but slightly different structure in my app
2011-04-12T19:40:54  <adamgoucher> http://conpro.tnc.org/advanced_search -- its the eco region section. want a locator that operates the visible select box
