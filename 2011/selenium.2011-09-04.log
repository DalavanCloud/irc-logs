2011-09-04T09:54:46  <soc42> hi #selenium
2011-09-04T09:55:02  <soc42> i have serious problems starting seleniium server on mac os x
2011-09-04T09:55:50  <soc42> running the latest v2.5.0 gives me errors while starting up the server
2011-09-04T09:56:24  <soc42> tried the recent v1.0.1 also stating java errors
2011-09-04T09:57:18  <soc42> machine details are mac os x 10.6 and java version "1.6.0_24"
2011-09-04T09:57:39  <soc42> i cannot find anything on google about that
2011-09-04T09:58:34  <soc42> i tried starting up the v1.01 server while entering: java -jar selenium-server.jar -interactive
2011-09-04T09:59:08  <soc42> the server is starting, aksing for a cmd to enter
2011-09-04T10:00:56  <soc42> after the command i get: java.lang.RuntimeException: sessionId  doesn't exist;

2011-09-04T10:12:32  <soc42> it seems that the server is now up and running...
2011-09-04T10:13:51  <soc42> just have a look at http://pastebin.com/dAwvgZxX
2011-09-04T10:14:09  <soc42> is everything fine now with the server?
2011-09-04T10:14:14  <soc42> how can i verify?
2011-09-04T10:17:24  <jarib> looks good to me
2011-09-04T10:18:45  <soc42> ok, that helps a lot
2011-09-04T10:20:01  <soc42> so back to the v1.01 isseu: it was maybe just the wrong cmd in interactive mode, but i used the displayed example...
2011-09-04T10:20:27  <soc42> anyway, v2.50 seems to work now and i can go on

2011-09-04T13:26:11  <soc42> i read your comments on that at "gmane.comp.web.selenium.devel" and was wondering if there is somekind of direction pointing into the future, which of the currently two "non-official" might get official soon
