2011-07-07T01:04:46  <Binken_> :-d I can test windows platform with IE6,7,8,9 and Firefox 3.6 4 and Chrome :)
2011-07-07T01:05:27  <simonstewart> Nice.
2011-07-07T01:05:49  <simonstewart> I've got IE 9 and multiple versions of firefox easily to hand
2011-07-07T01:05:52  <barancev> morning! I've installed today official compatibility VPC images from MS, and have XP with IE6, 7, 8 + FF 3.0.19, 3.6.18, 4.0.1
2011-07-07T01:06:01  <simonstewart> Wow.
2011-07-07T01:06:07  <simonstewart> That's an awful lot of images
2011-07-07T01:06:15  <Binken_> VPC images...

2011-07-07T05:36:01  <quzi> what about drivers for different browsers. I think I read that they all get detached from the main server jar. So if I want to run Firefox driver. Do I need to download it? Or it comes bundled with Firefox?
2011-07-07T05:41:57  <AutomatedTester> downloading the client
2011-07-07T05:41:57  <AutomatedTester> clientside jar would do
2011-07-07T05:41:57  <AutomatedTester> have a look at the download page on http://selenium.googlecode.com
2011-07-07T05:44:12  *** adamgoucher has joined #selenium
2011-07-07T05:45:45  <quzi> AutomatedTester: Thanks. So the standalone Jar will work. I know that. I'm just not sure is it because the Firefox implementation of web-driver is in the selenium jar or because when I install Firefox I install it's driver as well?
2011-07-07T05:46:32  <AutomatedTester> it will always be a separate download
2011-07-07T05:47:58  <AutomatedTester> browser vendors won't ship it with the browser normally, it will need a different download

2011-07-07T05:53:36  <quzi> AutomatedTester: I really sorry If I start to sound stupid and/or annoying :)  But your answer confuses me.. First you say that I don't need to download FirefoxDriver to run FF right now. Then you say it will be separate. The FirefoxDriver isn't in the downloads section of Selenium and I still don't get it where is it at the moment.

2011-07-07T05:58:56  <RossPatterson> quzi: Some of the browsers have drivers that they supply as separate downloads, that are not built by or maintained as part of the Selenium project.  Others are built by and maintained by the project.   Right now, the first group consists solely of Google Chrome and Opera.
2011-07-07T06:00:44  <quzi> RossPatterson: Thanks. Do I understand right that the 2nd group(made by selenium) is integrated in their code and included in the standalone selenium server jar for example?
2011-07-07T06:01:14  <RossPatterson> Yes.
2011-07-07T06:01:21  <simonstewart> Right. So, how green are the builds. I'd love test_ie and //java/client/test/com/thoughtworks/selenium:ie-emulation-test:run to pass on all versions of IE
2011-07-07T06:01:32  <barancev> simonstewart: I've found that clickAt does not work because Actions does not do click after mouseMove, just a moment, I'll give a repro

2011-07-07T08:13:08  <santiycr> makes sense

2011-07-07T08:13:44  <simonstewart> You'll end up with a remote element finder
2011-07-07T08:13:56  <simonstewart> So each call will send the locator over the wire and return the element
2011-07-07T08:15:03  <santiycr> can't I just  use findElement and write the code to figure out the By strategy to use?
2011-07-07T08:15:16  <santiycr> then I'd just use webdriver's regular finding strategy
2011-07-07T08:15:23  <simonstewart> By.selenium, you mean?
2011-07-07T08:15:26  <simonstewart> That'd work too
2011-07-07T08:15:46  <santiycr> that would give me a webelement without problems
2011-07-07T08:16:00  <simonstewart> Which is basically what you want
2011-07-07T08:16:07  <santiycr> right

2011-07-07T08:16:27  <simonstewart> At some point, I'll finish the server-side emulation
2011-07-07T08:16:33  <santiycr> all I'd need to do is understand the user's locator enough to be able to choose the right strategy
2011-07-07T08:16:35  <simonstewart> That'll make things a little easier
2011-07-07T08:16:48  <simonstewart> Which you can re-use the existing element finder for
2011-07-07T08:16:56  <simonstewart> That understands Selenium locators
2011-07-07T08:17:08  <santiycr> server-side emulation would rock!
2011-07-07T08:17:19  <santiycr> we could move everyone to webdriver and not even tell them :)
2011-07-07T08:17:36  <simonstewart> You know that there's a patch that half implements in the issue tracker?
2011-07-07T08:17:53  <santiycr> oh, didn't know that
2011-07-07T08:18:03  <perlite11> Hey all, I'm just getting started with Selenium, which I'm driving from the perl interface. Everything is going great, but I have a question about targeting one of several 'submit' buttons on a page.
2011-07-07T08:18:07  <santiycr> that'd be so sweet
2011-07-07T08:18:24  <santiycr> alright, time to get my hands dirty
2011-07-07T08:18:31  <santiycr> simonstewart thanks for the tips!
2011-07-07T08:19:10  <simonstewart> santiycr take a look at #1734
2011-07-07T08:19:10  <selbot2> simon.m.stewart open/accepted Server-side implementation of the webdriver-backed selenium - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1734
2011-07-07T08:19:37  <perlite11> From the docs, it looks like i should be able to do this: $sel->click("id=main_search_button"), but when I try that I get ERROR: Element main_search_button not found
2011-07-07T08:19:51  <santiycr> simonstewart: will do, thanks!
2011-07-07T08:20:06  <perlite11> The HTML I'm trying to target looks like this: 				<input id="main_search_button" class="button" type="submit" value="Search" />
2011-07-07T08:20:08  <perlite11> Any input?
2011-07-07T08:20:46  <simonstewart> From what you've us, it should work
2011-07-07T08:21:10  <santiycr> perlite11: probably you need to wait for the element to be present
2011-07-07T08:21:31  <santiycr> selenium may be going too fast and trying to click even before the element is in the page
2011-07-07T08:21:48  <simonstewart> I'm about 5 minutes away from commenting out TestClickAt
2011-07-07T08:21:54  <simonstewart> It's new functionality since RC3
2011-07-07T08:22:03  <simonstewart> And getting it working is driving me totally insane
2011-07-07T08:22:07  <simonstewart> And I want 2.0 out the door
2011-07-07T08:22:21  <santiycr> clickAt?
2011-07-07T08:22:36  <simonstewart> The advanced user interactions have Actions.click with an offset
2011-07-07T08:22:44  <simonstewart> which we use to implement selenium.clickAt
2011-07-07T08:22:50  <santiycr> ah, I see
2011-07-07T08:23:01  <santiycr> oh, simonstewart, something interesting I saw some days ago with the regular click on windows
2011-07-07T08:23:09  <simonstewart> ?
2011-07-07T08:23:18  <santiycr> turns out this app has a moving bar on the top, that will stay there when you scroll
2011-07-07T08:23:25  <simonstewart> yes
2011-07-07T08:23:36  <santiycr> so, FF will scroll down to click on the element, the bar will cover it
2011-07-07T08:23:39  <santiycr> then the click will fail
2011-07-07T08:23:42  <simonstewart> ok
2011-07-07T08:23:46  <simonstewart> not fixing before 2.0
2011-07-07T08:23:48  <santiycr> kind of unfortunate
2011-07-07T08:23:54  <santiycr> yeah, no worries
2011-07-07T08:23:54  <simonstewart> it's a long standing issue
2011-07-07T08:24:06  <santiycr> I know it's not an easy situation
2011-07-07T08:24:20  <santiycr> basically, they can cover elements located anywhere in the display
2011-07-07T08:24:26  <santiycr> so, I don't think there's a real solution
2011-07-07T08:24:45  <santiycr> (other than ChromeDriver or OperaDriver)
2011-07-07T08:24:49  <santiycr> which do the right thing
2011-07-07T08:25:18  <simonstewart> We tend to scroll very aggressively

2011-07-07T08:26:29  <simonstewart> If we could tell that an element was in the viewport we'd be more conservative
2011-07-07T08:26:47  <santiycr> maybe scrolling only to locate the element in the middle would reduce the chances that race condition happens
2011-07-07T08:26:52  <simonstewart> And less likely to make the browser move unpleasently during a test
2011-07-07T08:26:53  <santiycr> but still, it can always happen
2011-07-07T08:27:09  <santiycr> can't you tell if it's in the viewport?
2011-07-07T08:27:16  <simonstewart> well, I can
2011-07-07T08:27:23  <santiycr> you get the element location and the window scroll level

2011-07-07T09:36:11  <dawagner> #1766
2011-07-07T09:36:12  <selbot2>  open/new FirefoxWebElement#sendKeys("Cheese!") sends keys to URL bar with Firefox 4 - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1766
2011-07-07T09:36:13  <simonstewart> yeah. I'd expect the v1 emulation to work, as that's falling back to selenium 1
2011-07-07T09:36:23  <simonstewart> Yes. Eran's also looking at that one

2011-07-07T09:39:49  <simonstewart> So: do we delay the release until #1766 is fixed?

2011-07-07T09:39:53  <simonstewart> Votes, please!
2011-07-07T09:40:25  <barancev> a workaround is "click before sendKeys"
2011-07-07T09:41:04  <eranm> simonstewart, a quick pointer to the code that calls WebDriver.quit() when running WebDriverSeleniumTestSuite?
2011-07-07T09:41:29  <simonstewart> one moment, please caller
2011-07-07T09:41:40  <eranm> nm, think I found it
2011-07-07T09:41:55  <RossPatterson> How pervasive is the bug?  The report suggests it's an intermittent thing.
2011-07-07T09:42:11  <simonstewart> It's intermittent to the point where we're having trouble replicating it
2011-07-07T09:42:41  <RossPatterson> Mmm ... Heisenbugs.
2011-07-07T09:42:56  <simonstewart> It's because Firefox 4 is fast
2011-07-07T09:43:00  <simonstewart> and we're very close to the metal
2011-07-07T09:43:11  <simonstewart> If we put in a 100ms delay before typing we'd be fie
2011-07-07T09:43:15  <simonstewart> fine
2011-07-07T09:43:26  <simonstewart> (I'm not seriously suggesting we put in a 100ms delay)
2011-07-07T09:44:16  <dawagner> ooi, between the js focusing the element, and the native code being called to send keypresses, does the js element claim to be focused?
2011-07-07T09:44:37  <RossPatterson> So, if barancev is right that click-before-sendkeys works, and if the reason it works is that it establishes focus (rather than that it introduces a delay), perhaps the FF4 version of sendkeys should verify that the field has focus, at least until such time as the bug can be exterminated.
2011-07-07T09:44:45  <simonstewart> You can't rely on the element being focused
2011-07-07T09:44:53  <simonstewart> (what if you're calling "sendKeys" on the body?)
2011-07-07T09:45:31  <RossPatterson> Applying the "emulate the user" rule, how does a user type without establishing focus?
2011-07-07T09:45:44  <simonstewart> It's not that
2011-07-07T09:45:46  <RossPatterson> OK
2011-07-07T09:45:50  <simonstewart> It's that some elements never get focus
2011-07-07T09:45:57  <simonstewart> Think of keyboard shortcuts in gmail
2011-07-07T09:46:00  <simonstewart> Nothing has "focus"
2011-07-07T09:46:02  <dawagner> simonstewart: s/focused/the active element/
2011-07-07T09:46:18  <simonstewart> Always returns BODY if nothing is obviously focused
2011-07-07T09:46:33  <simonstewart> You want something that means "in the entire UI, what element would get keyboard input"
2011-07-07T09:47:25  <jimevans> oh ffs, i don't have time for meetings right now
2011-07-07T09:48:28  <simonstewart> Don't worry. We;ll be here for a while yet
2011-07-07T09:49:00  <jimevans> it's not just 2.0, but i appreciate that.
2011-07-07T09:49:21  <simonstewart> What? You mean that there's more to life than 2.0?
2011-07-07T09:49:25  <simonstewart> The mind boggles :)
2011-07-07T09:50:11  <eranm> simonstewart, does the TestClickAt test pass on Windows ?
2011-07-07T09:50:45  <eranm> on Linux with native events enabled, it complains because it can't find the element specified in the locator

2011-07-07T11:42:55  <samit> thats kind of trivial, the formatter infrastructure is much more work than that.
2011-07-07T11:43:53  <simonstewart> jimevans: yt?
2011-07-07T11:43:59  <simonstewart> jarib: yt?
2011-07-07T11:44:05  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: yt?
2011-07-07T11:44:11  <jimevans> i am.
2011-07-07T11:44:15  <adamgoucher> samit: non-trivial in that it breaks the existing formatters that are out there?
2011-07-07T11:44:18  <simonstewart> Cool.
2011-07-07T11:44:35  <jimevans> had an atoms question
2011-07-07T11:44:35  <simonstewart> Just running the final selenium tests now
2011-07-07T11:44:40  <simonstewart> Go for it
2011-07-07T11:44:41  <jimevans> simonstewart: would bot.dom.getLocationInView work for IE?
2011-07-07T11:44:44  <jimevans> and more importantly, does it work when the element in question is in a frame?
2011-07-07T11:44:58  <samit> adamgoucher: nope, all existing stuff will work as is.
2011-07-07T11:45:03  *** nilian has quit IRC
2011-07-07T11:45:11  <simonstewart> I _think_ the answer to both is "yes"
2011-07-07T11:45:12  <jimevans> i just saw #2002
2011-07-07T11:45:13  <selbot2>  open/new click on element in iframe containing cross domain content does nothing when using InternetExplorerDriver - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2002
2011-07-07T11:45:17  *** nilian has joined #selenium
2011-07-07T11:45:26  <jimevans> and, yeah, it's broken for IE.
2011-07-07T11:45:44  <simonstewart> Release blocking "broken"?
2011-07-07T11:45:45  <jimevans> basically because of how we're trying to calculate the click coordinates.
2011-07-07T11:45:50  <simonstewart> Damn it
2011-07-07T11:45:53  <jimevans> no, I don't think so.
2011-07-07T11:45:56  <simonstewart> k
2011-07-07T11:46:21  <jimevans> it's an ongoing issue for certain frames that the IE driver doesn't calculate the click point right.
2011-07-07T11:46:33  <jimevans> i iz bad at maths.
2011-07-07T11:46:35  <adamgoucher> samit: email me how the formatter stuff has changed enough to warrant the bump? (i just dont understand not that i dont believe you)
2011-07-07T11:46:50  <simonstewart> maths? tell me more of this "maths" you speak so highly about
2011-07-07T11:46:58  <jimevans> :)
2011-07-07T11:47:16  <jimevans> if I can pawn that off onto some common code that "just works", then yay.
2011-07-07T11:47:21  <simonstewart> Am pretty sure that code was funky when I worked on it
2011-07-07T11:47:57  <simonstewart> Are the prebuilts for windows up to date?
2011-07-07T11:48:02  <simonstewart> I'll be releasing off a mac
2011-07-07T11:48:21  <jimevans> if you have cross-domain frames, then the problem's even worse, because the driver can't get all of the documents (stupid xss-prevention fixes)
2011-07-07T11:49:04  <simonstewart> Indeed.
2011-07-07T11:49:07  <jimevans> but if there's a way to calculate the correct position without leaving the friendly confines of the framed document, the whole problem can be fixed.
2011-07-07T11:49:20  <simonstewart> If we were a BHO it's easy to calculate
2011-07-07T11:49:22  <simonstewart> But we're not
2011-07-07T11:49:28  <simonstewart> So, meh to that idea
2011-07-07T11:49:37  <jimevans> I saw the atom, and thought, "hey, wait a minute, that might work"
2011-07-07T11:49:51  <jimevans> (cause I'm not using the atom right now.
2011-07-07T11:49:54  <jimevans> )
2011-07-07T11:50:20  <simonstewart> We should do some checks
2011-07-07T11:50:35  <simonstewart> Though I thought it was enough to grab the HWND's location
2011-07-07T11:50:56  <simonstewart> And calculate relative to that
2011-07-07T11:51:24  <jimevans> well at the moment, we're getting the position using getBoundingClientRect(), which give position relative to 0, 0 of the DOM.
2011-07-07T11:51:30  <simonstewart> You don't want to know what I'm listening to right now, but it's awesome
2011-07-07T11:51:39  <simonstewart> Not relative to the DOM
2011-07-07T11:51:42  <simonstewart> to the viewport

2011-07-07T13:19:12  <barancev> is there an explanation when one should use Keys.chord ?
2011-07-07T13:19:35  <barancev> I'm investigating testChordControlCutAndPaste
2011-07-07T13:19:56  <jimevans> adamgoucher: refresh my memory how to update the downloads page
2011-07-07T13:20:04  <barancev> it has a line that does not work: element.sendKeys(Keys.CONTROL, "x" + "v");
2011-07-07T13:20:42  <barancev> it should copy-and-past-back
2011-07-07T13:21:04  <barancev> I can modify it in two ways to make it work:
2011-07-07T13:21:10  <barancev> element.sendKeys(Keys.CONTROL, "x", "v");
2011-07-07T13:21:12  <barancev> or
2011-07-07T13:21:29  <barancev> element.sendKeys(Keys,chord(Keys.CONTROL, "x" + "v"));
2011-07-07T13:21:46  <barancev> which one is the Right Way?
2011-07-07T13:22:12  <jimevans> barancev: where doesn't it work? I've been running that test against IE all day, and it works fine for me
2011-07-07T13:22:35  <barancev> FF5 on Win7
2011-07-07T13:22:55  <barancev> it cuts only
2011-07-07T13:23:30  <jimevans> I've had the entire test suite running on FF5 with Windows 7. The syntax in the test should be sufficient.
2011-07-07T13:24:21  <barancev> my bad, element.sendKeys(Keys.chord(Keys.CONTROL, "x" + "v")); does not work either
2011-07-07T13:24:46  <barancev> only element.sendKeys(Keys.CONTROL, "x", "v"); works as expected
2011-07-07T13:25:03  <jimevans> the way modifier keys work in the native events code (you are running with native events, no?) it should be fine.
2011-07-07T13:25:45  <barancev> it is not interminient, I get it every time with "x" + "v"
2011-07-07T13:26:02  <barancev> yes, I hepe native events are on
2011-07-07T13:26:09  <barancev> s/hepe/hope/
2011-07-07T13:26:59  <barancev> may be "x" + "v" sends events faster?
2011-07-07T13:27:06  <jimevans> I've gotten the test to work every time, but I'm not going to argue about it anymore. It's Java, and Firefox, two pieces I'm less than an expert on.
2011-07-07T13:29:03  <barancev> IE passes this test, it is FF specific
2011-07-07T13:29:31  <jimevans> But essentially, sendKeys under the covers treats everything as a CharSequence in Java.
2011-07-07T13:30:19  <jimevans> so it shouldn't matter whether you send it in as a single string or an array of chars.
2011-07-07T13:31:03  <barancev> it should not. but it does matter, I don't khow why :(
2011-07-07T13:32:17  <jimevans> well, again, I'm not an expert in the architecture of the Firefox driver, so I really don't know what would cause the keystrokes to not be processed correctly.
2011-07-07T13:32:27  <jimevans> They're processed right in my environment.
2011-07-07T13:35:24  <barancev> Keys.CONTROL + "x", "v" does not work either
2011-07-07T13:35:36  <barancev> only Keys.CONTROL, "x", "v" works as expected
2011-07-07T13:35:59  <adamgoucher> jimevans: in google code there is a top level branch called websites -- www is one of them. once committed it gets deployed via bamboo (on i think a 5 minute timer)

2011-07-07T14:15:05  <Mayank> Hi, I have a set of span elements on the page with different id's. When the page is loaded the only one span element is clickable, and progressively rest of the span elements get clickable. Now when I am trying to detect these elements with explicit wait, the webdriver keeps waiting even though the span elements are there on the page, its just that they are not clickable. How can i detect these elements?

2011-07-07T14:22:32  <barancev> kidding. no way, selenium has no support for printing dialog

2011-07-07T14:22:54  <andytinkham> ssims: I know at one point long ago, I had ruby code that printed a document from IE. Didn't use Selenium though - used IE's COM interface
2011-07-07T14:23:09  <barancev> you may use another tool to click OK button, e.g. AutoIT
2011-07-07T14:25:18  <andytinkham> ssims: I don't have the code handy here (though I should have it available at home and could find it tonight), but it was probably using the ExecWB com method, and passing in OLECMDID_PRINT, OLECMDEXECOPT_DONTPROMPTUSER arguments, like show here: http://delphicikk.atw.hu/listaz.php?id=1391&oldal=41 (but in ruby)

2011-07-07T14:38:29  <cam> question about Selenium's WebDriver
2011-07-07T14:38:33  <andytinkham> jarib: Seems like a good idea :)
2011-07-07T14:38:59  <cam> is the webdriver the underlying implementation that is being used by selenium-rc client drivers?
2011-07-07T14:39:04  <cam> in the java realm at least
2011-07-07T14:39:40  <cam> i was having lots of issues performing click actions on dom elements using a InternetExplorerDriver
2011-07-07T14:40:00  <andytinkham> cam: I *think* it depends on whether you're using a WebDriverBackedSelenium instance or not, but I'm not sure
2011-07-07T14:40:17  <cam> well that's a good question
2011-07-07T14:40:26  <cam> are either of those the underlying implementation in selenium-rc?
2011-07-07T14:40:26  <jarib> andy's right, only if you're using WebDriverBackedSelenium will the RC API be backed by webdriver
2011-07-07T14:40:32  <cam> because i actually tried both
2011-07-07T14:40:40  <cam> ok got it
2011-07-07T14:40:42  <jarib> RC is a different set of technologies
2011-07-07T14:40:55  *** davehunt_ has joined #selenium
2011-07-07T14:41:16  *** davehunt has quit IRC
2011-07-07T14:41:31  <cam> so basically my question  is....if i'm not able to use the WebDriver OR WebDriverBackedSelenium classes to select and perform an action on an element
2011-07-07T14:41:35  <cam> its also not going to work in RC ?
2011-07-07T14:41:43  <cam> and that did seem to be the case when i tested it
2011-07-07T14:42:28  <andytinkham> I'm not sure you can draw the conclusion that RC will or won't work based on WebDriver/WBBackedSe not working.
2011-07-07T14:42:29  <cam> looks like there is actually an easy way around that though, just assign all the elements i need an ID
2011-07-07T14:42:47  <cam> okay, so that was my question
2011-07-07T14:42:54  *** samitbadle has joined #selenium
2011-07-07T14:42:56  <cam> so you aren't sure ....i'm not sure either
2011-07-07T14:43:13  <samitbadle> hiya
2011-07-07T14:43:30  <andytinkham> Based on them being different technologies, I'm going to remove my "not sure" :) I think you can't draw the conclusion reliably
2011-07-07T14:43:39  <andytinkham> hey Samit
2011-07-07T14:43:46  <cam> i agree
2011-07-07T14:44:00  <cam> so the best way to avoid this is to grab everything by IDs
2011-07-07T14:44:12  *** ssims has quit IRC
2011-07-07T14:44:17  <barancev> cam: what exact problem with click have you got?
2011-07-07T14:44:20  <samitbadle> Hi Andy
2011-07-07T14:44:48  <cam> well its on really, i have some <a href> items on a page, and some i can reference and click using the webdriver
2011-07-07T14:44:51  <cam> and some i can't
2011-07-07T14:45:15  <cam> click("link=Blah blah blah's");
2011-07-07T14:45:36  <cam> or something along those lines .... i dont have the code infront of me at the moment
2011-07-07T14:45:47  <cam> but it seemed awfully strange that one link in particular didn't work
2011-07-07T14:45:58  <barancev> selenium.click("link=xxx") is API 1.0. do you use WebDriverBackedSelenium?
2011-07-07T14:46:00  <cam> the only real difference was, was that it had apostrophe in the link name
2011-07-07T14:46:16  <cam> i realize i probably didn't type the exact call correctly
2011-07-07T14:46:31  <cam> let me go find the code and load it up....it's a VM unfortunately
2011-07-07T14:46:45  <barancev> ok, use :gist

2011-07-07T15:59:39  <autojack> earlier I asked, "is there a way to set a delay between each command in Selenium 2, the way you can with RC?"
2011-07-07T16:00:01  <cam> can you sleep on the thraed?
2011-07-07T16:00:18  <cam> TrhThread.currentThread().sleep(millis)
2011-07-07T16:00:28  <cam> oops
2011-07-07T16:00:31  <cam> that's Thread.
2011-07-07T16:00:37  <autojack> barancev asked why I want to slow down my script. answer: just during testing, to see more easily what is going on :)
2011-07-07T16:00:42  <autojack> I mean just when I'm writing it.
2011-07-07T16:00:53  <cam> use the debugger maybe
