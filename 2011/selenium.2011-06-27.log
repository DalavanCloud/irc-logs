2011-06-27T04:15:13  <iserko> hey guys, quick question, I'm running Selenium (Python bindings) on an EC2 instance using Xvfb and its taking nearly twice as long to run through our tests (4 mins on my Macbook vs. 8 mins on EC2 m1.large instance)... is this to be expected?
2011-06-27T04:15:44  <simonstewart> Where is the test running?
2011-06-27T04:15:50  <simonstewart> On the EC2 instance too?
2011-06-27T04:16:08  <iserko> yes
2011-06-27T04:16:17  <simonstewart> Interesting
2011-06-27T04:16:28  <simonstewart> Same versions of firefox?
2011-06-27T04:16:55  <iserko> even starting the tests takes a while (where the browser initializes) ... takes like 2 seconds locally, but nearly 30 seconds on the EC2 instance
2011-06-27T04:16:56  <selbot> New news from builds: WEB-SEHQ-119 was SUCCESSFUL : Updated by simon.m.stewart <http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/WEB-SEHQ-119>

2011-06-27T04:17:12  <iserko> using v4
2011-06-27T04:17:38  <simonstewart> OK, so it sounds more like a problem with the EC2 machine. What's the load look like
2011-06-27T04:17:56  <iserko> pretty much an idle machine
2011-06-27T04:17:58  <simonstewart> That took far longer than it should have: https://twitter.com/#!/shs96c/status/85308136134688768
2011-06-27T04:18:04  <simonstewart> Hmmm...
2011-06-27T04:18:12  <iserko> regular load average is around 0.05
2011-06-27T04:18:19  <simonstewart> Sounds good
2011-06-27T04:18:50  <simonstewart> But the start up time is waaaay out of whack
2011-06-27T04:18:57  <simonstewart> Which suggests that something's not right

2011-06-27T05:04:03  <simonstewart> But there's some classes that we're thinking of adding to the support package to try and make things easier.
2011-06-27T05:04:59  <freynaud> simonstewart: no
2011-06-27T05:05:02  <freynaud> let me check
2011-06-27T05:05:21  <simonstewart> Thanks :)
2011-06-27T05:05:29  <Binken> aha
2011-06-27T05:07:23  <Binken> Are you using the DSL?
2011-06-27T05:07:34  <Binken> in your test framework?
2011-06-27T05:07:49  <simonstewart> I spend most of my time working directly on the webdriver code
2011-06-27T05:08:00  <Binken> :)
2011-06-27T05:08:13  <simonstewart> So when I write tests, I tend to just throw things together pretty swiftly
2011-06-27T05:08:36  <simonstewart> If you put together a gist of the API you'd expect from a table class, that'd help
2011-06-27T05:08:37  <Binken> (6) I like your support class most :)
2011-06-27T05:09:38  <freynaud> simonstewart: something wrong for me too. 2 tests failing.
2011-06-27T05:09:55  <simonstewart> If I say "great" you'll get what I mean?
2011-06-27T05:09:58  <simonstewart> "great"

2011-06-27T06:01:36  <simonstewart> Double click works on Firefox now
2011-06-27T06:01:42  <simonstewart> Though only using native events

2011-06-27T06:01:58  <simonstewart> I had some spare time and implemented it
2011-06-27T06:02:30  <jimevans> yeah, i was looking for native events. was hoping to get it for free in ie.
2011-06-27T06:03:03  <simonstewart> Hmmm... let me have a hunt around
2011-06-27T06:03:39  <jimevans> speaking of interactions, are the synthesized-event versions of the actions atomized?
2011-06-27T06:03:43  <simonstewart> Nope, it's not there

2011-06-27T06:04:29  <simonstewart> Though I think we're getting to the point where we could implement a "SyntheticKeyboard" and Mouse client side
2011-06-27T06:05:13  <simonstewart> jimevans: I deleted toggle and setSelected earlier too
2011-06-27T06:05:21  <jimevans> hm. i was thinking i might have a go at allowing you to pass "enableNativeEvents=false"  in the capabilities to the ie driver and use synthetic events.
2011-06-27T06:05:49  <jimevans> saw the code deletion. i'm running the .net tests for firefox after doing the same.
2011-06-27T06:07:08  <simonstewart> that'd be a cool thing to do
2011-06-27T06:07:27  <jimevans> uh-oh. i'm getting "could not load native events" in firefox. Shouldn't've upgraded to FF5 on this machine.
2011-06-27T06:07:43  <Ivog> simonstewart:  Shouldnt there be an intermediate grid release before releasing 2.0 to give people a chance to play with grid2 b4 its released?
2011-06-27T06:08:01  <simonstewart> I might try breaking out chunks of the synthetic mouse to the webdriver-atoms directory
2011-06-27T06:08:13  <jimevans> simonstewart: that'd be handy.
2011-06-27T06:08:31  <simonstewart> There's a new grid release in rc3
2011-06-27T06:08:43  <simonstewart> We rolled grid into the main remote server

2011-06-27T06:11:26  <jimevans> well, i wanted to make sure i had the latest bits before testing toggle() and setSelected() delete for .NET. :)
2011-06-27T06:12:00  <simonstewart> good point. I've tested them with synthesized events on OS X

2011-06-27T06:13:25  <freynaud> simonstewart: 500 a success rather :) I didn't want to add anything to the protocol jsut for grid, to be able to launch a normal server in the grid without extra glue

2011-06-27T06:58:44  * simonstewart listens
2011-06-27T06:58:53  <AutomatedTester> we have to get the mutha f@£$ing taser off the mutha f£$%ing plane
2011-06-27T06:59:01  <AutomatedTester> oh wait, wrong movie
2011-06-27T06:59:33  <jimevans> i'm not sure i'd be willing to change the architecture to do it, but the use of the http server (mongoose) is a potential bottleneck
2011-06-27T06:59:42  <jimevans> particularly the url matching algorithm.
2011-06-27T06:59:48  <jimevans> which is spectacularly inefficient.
2011-06-27T07:00:01  <nirvdrum> simonstewart: I don't like to tell people how to behave, but that shit just wouldn't stop.
2011-06-27T07:00:11  <nirvdrum> Similar douchebaggery on that issue #1854.
2011-06-27T07:00:12  <selbot2>  open/new Selenium 2.0 RC2 gets constantly slower during test suite - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1854
2011-06-27T07:00:26  <jimevans> the second is the use of the automation atoms. ie's javascript engine is really slow up until ie 9, and then only on 32-bit.

2011-06-27T07:01:18  <simonstewart> Well, the atoms make the drivers consistent
2011-06-27T07:01:19  <jimevans> again, i'm pretty sure the efficiencies in development probably outweigh the perf hit, but i'm open to suggestions there.
2011-06-27T07:01:31  *** baijum has quit IRC
2011-06-27T07:01:59  <simonstewart> I asked an IE evangalist about IE 10 and JIT
2011-06-27T07:02:16  <jimevans> agreed. i've not dug into the atoms themselves, so i don't know whether there are perf optimizations to be had there for IE.
2011-06-27T07:02:17  <simonstewart> I don't think 64 bit IE 10 is going to have it either
2011-06-27T07:02:53  <jimevans> personally, i *like* not having to maintain element-finding code.
2011-06-27T07:03:10  <jimevans> and all the other stuff that the atoms give me.
2011-06-27T07:03:38  <nirvdrum> I'm probably going to show extreme ignorance here, but couldn't some of the atoms be written as JS handlers in the IE driver, so they hit native calls?
2011-06-27T07:03:41  <jimevans> the

2011-06-27T07:04:21  <simonstewart> Ah. Dinner's arrived
2011-06-27T07:04:23  <simonstewart> biab
2011-06-27T07:04:53  <rpk> is there a reason we don't return a webelement that might be null, and offer an exists method on that webelement?
2011-06-27T07:05:24  *** antlong has joined #selenium
2011-06-27T07:05:37  <jimevans> for IE, we take the atoms and "compile" them using the closure compiler into strings in a c++ header file
2011-06-27T07:05:50  <jimevans> then we execute that javascript in IE.
2011-06-27T07:05:56  <nirvdrum> jimevans: I must profess I haven't looked at the atoms virtually at all.  But if they're just JS calls, couldn't you register an IDispatch-compatible handler that just handles some of the calls?  E.g., I've done something similar to serialize elements to JSON.  the json2 lib was painfully slow, so I rewrote it in C++ and just call into that with JS.

2011-06-27T07:06:32  <jimevans> rpk: that's a great question for simonstewart when he returns.
2011-06-27T07:06:49  <nirvdrum> In this case, the compiler would spit out calls that would trigger something in the IEDriver to fallback to native calls.
2011-06-27T07:07:09  <rpk> jumevans: ok, I'm sure its been discussed and long decided, just curious as to the official answer (people want it added as a feature)
2011-06-27T07:07:12  <nirvdrum> So JS is really just used to pass params and fetch a response, but no real execution.
2011-06-27T07:07:45  <jimevans> nirvdrum: that's a very interesting notion.
2011-06-27T07:07:58  <rpk> jimevans ^^^ /sp
2011-06-27T07:08:04  <nirvdrum> jimevans: Very similar to what we do for SnapsIE, actually.
2011-06-27T07:08:27  <nirvdrum> jimevans: If that's doable, then you could just gradually build out native definitions for the slowest calls and not really deal with IE's terrible JS engine.
2011-06-27T07:08:27  <jimevans> but at that point, it seems to me there's no functional difference than implementing my own code in c++ at that point.
2011-06-27T07:08:56  <nirvdrum> True.  Except you have a fallback to the JS implementation and you just swap out stuff as it's deemed to be too slow.
2011-06-27T07:09:23  <jimevans> at the moment here's what the flow looks like:
2011-06-27T07:10:22  <jimevans> language binding > json wire protocol > mongoose http server > c++ command handler > javascript execution  > ie
2011-06-27T07:10:42  <jimevans> before we enabled the atoms, the "javascript execution" step wasn't there.
2011-06-27T07:11:30  <jimevans> using the idispatch handler it sounds like we'd end up doing this:
2011-06-27T07:11:54  <jimevans> language binding > json wire protocol > mongoose http server > c++ command handler > javascript execution  > idispatch handler
2011-06-27T07:12:07  *** |izzie has joined #selenium
2011-06-27T07:12:22  <jimevans> though the "javascript execution" portion becomes minimal at that point.
2011-06-27T07:13:02  <jimevans> seems like it'd be simpler just to not use the atoms and use the COM interfaces directly in the C++ code for those commands that are inefficient.
2011-06-27T07:13:37  <jimevans> luckily, the atoms aren't all-or-nothing. we can pick and choose which we use.
2011-06-27T07:14:23  <jimevans> but the upside of using them is that we guarantee (within limits) consistent behavior between browsers.

2011-06-27T07:18:45  <simonstewart> Sadly, the bit that makes everything slow is also the nastiest code to convert to native
2011-06-27T07:19:08  <simonstewart> rpk: the main reason is that it makes the API confusing
2011-06-27T07:19:17  <simonstewart> Right now, when you get an element, you have an element
2011-06-27T07:19:35  <rpk> thats what I assumed, you didn't want to introduce the possibility that webelement might be null
2011-06-27T07:19:37  <jimevans> the minor perf enhancement i'd like to implement involves the element cache. i'm using another wildly inefficient algorithm for determining if we already know about an element.
2011-06-27T07:20:10  <simonstewart> rpk: generally because the next thing that happens is a NullPointerException gets thrown. I'd rather have something specific and clear
2011-06-27T07:20:13  *** Ivog has quit IRC
2011-06-27T07:20:14  <jimevans> the longer a session runs, and the more elements you find, the worse it performs.
2011-06-27T07:20:28  <simonstewart> jimevans: improving the cache sounds like a good idea
2011-06-27T07:21:23  <jarib> would be nice to have proper benchmarks for this stuff
2011-06-27T07:21:59  <jimevans> the code in question is in IESessionWindow.cpp, on or around line 327 (right after a big honkin' TODO comment that says "make this more efficient")
2011-06-27T07:22:04  <rpk> simonstewart: the question they have is if you're using pageobjects, won't you need to reinitialize the pageobject if an element didn't exist
2011-06-27T07:22:09  <simonstewart> Benchmarks? Surely it's better to just guess?
2011-06-27T07:22:32  <jimevans> i'm open to ideas on how to solve for it. let me describe what i'm doing and see if anyone has ideas.
2011-06-27T07:22:34  <simonstewart> rpk: Unless your element is marked "@CacheLookup" every call results in an element lookup
2011-06-27T07:22:35  <jarib> not sure if you guys have seen https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit and http://twitter.com/bryckbost/status/84330341229281281
2011-06-27T07:23:21  <jimevans> we use a map to hold the list of "known" elements.
2011-06-27T07:23:35  <jarib> (and doing the wire protocol with QtWebKit seems pretty simple)
2011-06-27T07:24:02  <jimevans> the key is the element "id" and the value is the wrapped COM element (IHTMLElement) object.
2011-06-27T07:24:31  <simonstewart> Yeah. There's a screaming demand for a headless webkit
2011-06-27T07:24:45  <simonstewart> but the webkitdriver is a bugger to maintain
2011-06-27T07:24:53  <simonstewart> And no-one that I know what's to fix it
2011-06-27T07:25:02  <antlong> jarib: i've taken a liking to www.jelly.io
2011-06-27T07:25:05  <jarib> Qt still requires an X display
2011-06-27T07:25:23  <simonstewart> phantomjs also looks interesting
2011-06-27T07:25:26  <jimevans> when we locate a new COM element, we have to cycle through all of the known elements to see if it's already in the cache.
2011-06-27T07:25:50  <simonstewart> Ugh
2011-06-27T07:26:02  <simonstewart> I guess the key isn't different every time?
2011-06-27T07:26:03  <antlong> simonstewart: on a mac, it opens dock icons when you run it. notably slower than zombie too
2011-06-27T07:26:06  <rpk> simonstewart: thanks, today they learned/
2011-06-27T07:26:17  <simonstewart> :)
2011-06-27T07:26:31  <simonstewart> antlong: zombie suffers from the same thing as htmlunit
2011-06-27T07:26:33  <jimevans> well, the key in the map is our element "id". when we findElement(), we locate a new "real" element
2011-06-27T07:26:36  <simonstewart> it's not really a browser
2011-06-27T07:26:45  <simonstewart> ahhh
2011-06-27T07:27:18  <antlong> simonstewart: the real con of zombie, is nodes infancy
2011-06-27T07:27:48  <adamgoucher> and the real with is its name :)
2011-06-27T07:28:03  <simonstewart> zombies are cool
2011-06-27T07:28:10  <adamgoucher> ('vlad the deployer' still wins the name award though)
2011-06-27T07:28:10  <jarib> simonstewart: i couldn't find an example in phantomjs that navigated between two pages
2011-06-27T07:28:15  <jimevans> i'm thinking about keeping a separate "indexing" array into the map which caches the pointers to the IHTMLElement objects.
2011-06-27T07:28:17  <jarib> and the code base is tiny
2011-06-27T07:28:18  <antlong> zombie is a great name, but a headless zombie would be a dead one
2011-06-27T07:28:25  <jarib> capybara-webkit seems much more complete
2011-06-27T07:29:02  <jimevans> phantomjs is designed to run one script straight through, not be a resident application that can be controlled like a browser.
2011-06-27T07:29:20  <jimevans> there are open issues around that in their tracker though.
2011-06-27T07:29:24  <simonstewart> The funny thing is that I wrote a proof of concept webdriver wrapping qtwebkit in java
2011-06-27T07:29:34  <jarib> and in either case the Qt abstraction above webkit is high-level enough that it's probably simpler to just do the wire protocol from scratch
2011-06-27T07:29:34  <simonstewart> and then nokia announced that they weren't going to maintain it any more
2011-06-27T07:29:51  <jarib> s/either/any

2011-06-27T08:39:54  <AutomatedTester> I should make it "private"
2011-06-27T08:40:15  <AutomatedTester> it handles the capabilities being passed backwards and forwards between the driver and client
2011-06-27T08:40:27  <flacoste> fair enough

2011-06-27T10:41:35  <freynaud> the command line param are ignored and you have the default

2011-06-27T10:41:58  <davehunt> really, is that a new bug then because that at least works in rc3

2011-06-27T11:45:46  <freynaud> i didn't thing about it
2011-06-27T11:45:52  <freynaud> why would you ?
2011-06-27T11:45:58  <freynaud> 1 json = 1 node
2011-06-27T11:46:07  <freynaud> it has the config + all the envt supported
2011-06-27T11:46:19  <davehunt> yeah
2011-06-27T11:46:24  <davehunt> I use a properties file atm
2011-06-27T11:46:34  <davehunt> I can change it all around
2011-06-27T11:46:41  <freynaud> http://www.google.com/codesearch#2tHw6m3DZzo/trunk/java/server/src/org/openqa/grid/common/defaults/WebDriverDefaultNode.json
2011-06-27T11:47:16  <freynaud> in the end, you need to launch a vannila webdriver, generate a file like the json i linked, and send it to the hub
2011-06-27T11:47:34  <davehunt> freynaud: https://github.com/mozilla/moz-grid-config/blob/grid2/qa-selenium6.mv.mozilla.com.project.properties
2011-06-27T11:47:42  <freynaud> the selfregisteringremote does both, but if you have some specific stuff do do, you can build that yourself
2011-06-27T11:47:54  <davehunt> That's what I use atm, and read that in based on the hostname
2011-06-27T11:47:58  <freynaud> that's usually what I do in my grid, I never use the selfRegistering node
2011-06-27T11:48:37  *** ato has quit IRC
2011-06-27T11:49:00  <davehunt> I could create a JSON file for each machine, and specify that in the build.xml
2011-06-27T11:49:11  <freynaud> why for each machine ?
2011-06-27T11:49:18  <freynaud> are the capabilities differnet ?
2011-06-27T11:49:25  <davehunt> because each machine potentially has different capabilites
2011-06-27T11:49:41  <davehunt> hence why it would be nice to split by environment rather than node
2011-06-27T11:50:04  *** ato has joined #selenium
2011-06-27T11:50:32  <davehunt> like have a 'defaults' file, a 'mac' file, and a 'windows'
2011-06-27T11:50:34  <davehunt> etc
2011-06-27T11:51:15  <davehunt> I can work with the existing -file solution, and just put up with the small amount of duplication
2011-06-27T11:51:33  <freynaud> you shouldn't have to do any copy paste.
2011-06-27T11:51:41  <freynaud> how do you know the capabilities ?
2011-06-27T11:51:47  <freynaud> is it based on the machine name ?
2011-06-27T11:51:59  <davehunt> at the moment, yes
2011-06-27T11:52:21  <freynaud> why not having the on the grid rather than the node ?

2011-06-27T11:52:38  <davehunt> I don't understand the question
2011-06-27T11:52:55  <freynaud> like a small UI, listing the machine, and a register button, that start webdriver on the node, and create the right capability
2011-06-27T11:53:01  <freynaud> no need to push files to the node
2011-06-27T11:53:46  <davehunt> Sorry, I still don't understand
2011-06-27T11:53:51  <davehunt> Something on the web console?
2011-06-27T11:54:23  <freynaud> yes
2011-06-27T11:54:56  <davehunt> I'd prefer something that didn't involve a manual step of clicking a register button
2011-06-27T11:55:23  <freynaud> haha ! you can use selenium to click the button ^^

2011-06-27T11:56:44  <davehunt> I'm okay with the -file solution, I just think it's a bit unfortunate to have the configuration duplicated

2011-06-27T11:57:39  <rpk> davehunt: or maybe better autodetection
2011-06-27T11:57:55  <rpk> and then let me manage nodes from a central source...
2011-06-27T11:58:32  <davehunt> I'm not interested in autodetection, I don't find it an issue maintaining the environments
2011-06-27T11:58:47  <freynaud> davehunt:  the plan for the node refactoring is :
2011-06-27T11:59:07  <freynaud> when you launch the HUB, you can pass as many param as you want
2011-06-27T11:59:36  <freynaud> when you launch a NODE, you will inherit the param from the hub is not specified by the node
2011-06-27T11:59:46  <freynaud> so timeout etc can be changed just on the node
2011-06-27T11:59:54  <freynaud> and overwritten by the node
2011-06-27T12:00:00  <freynaud> is it what you need ?
2011-06-27T12:00:30  <davehunt> freynaud: sounds good

2011-06-27T12:55:53  <mh512> is this a problem with the selenium server ?

2011-06-27T13:04:17  <mh512> so the server isnt escaping it properly for python?
2011-06-27T13:05:40  <AutomatedTester> mh512: its probably not escaping it for any language

2011-06-27T14:32:11  <selbot2> michael.tamm2 half a minute ago - MichaelTamm: UrlChecker uses a cached thread pool with daemon threads now (Fixes issue 1756) - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12646
2011-06-27T14:33:42  <xirkus> does anyone know if jbehave-web plays nicely with WebDriver 2? from my cursory look at the source, it looks like it is geared more to Selenium 1 (although there is support for WebDriver/RemoteWebDriver).

2011-06-27T15:42:23  <wladston> guys, I'm trying isElementPresent(//*[(@name='email' or @id='email')])
2011-06-27T15:42:24  <wladston> isVisible(//*[(@name='email' or @id='email')]) but it isn't returning anything
2011-06-27T15:42:29  <wladston> the element exists and is present
