2011-05-27T05:59:06  <mario-goulart> Hi.  Sorry for the stupid question, but what does IME stand for?
2011-05-27T06:01:10  *** eranm has joined #selenium
2011-05-27T06:04:49  <RossPatterson> IME?  Where did you see that?
2011-05-27T06:06:07  <mario-goulart> RossPatterson: The json wire protocol mentions it (http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol)
2011-05-27T06:06:49  <mario-goulart> See /session/:sessionId/ime/activated for example.
2011-05-27T06:09:02  <RossPatterson> Good question.  It's apparently part of the WebDriver Input Method apparatus, so I'd expect eranm, jarib, or simonstewart would have an answer.
2011-05-27T06:09:51  <eranm> What was the question about IME exactly?
2011-05-27T06:10:01  <RossPatterson> "What does IME mean?"
2011-05-27T06:10:30  <eranm> RossPatterson: Input Method Editer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method_editor
2011-05-27T06:10:36  <eranm> For inputting complex scripts, basically
2011-05-27T06:10:53  <RossPatterson> mario-goulart: And there you have it :-)
2011-05-27T06:10:57  <mario-goulart> eranm, RossPatterson: thanks. :-)

2011-05-27T06:37:52  <eranm> pngl: where ?
2011-05-27T06:38:20  <pngl> eranm: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/Client/GeneratedDriver.html#attach_file-instance_method
2011-05-27T06:39:40  <eranm> That's Selenium 1 API, if I'm not mistaken.
2011-05-27T06:41:15  <pngl> eranm: ah, yes. But then I can't find the equivalent method for Selenium::WebDriver
2011-05-27T06:41:48  <eranm> That'd be sendKeys to a file upload element, with the name of the file
2011-05-27T06:43:16  <pngl> eranm: I see. But what if the file input element isn't part of a <form>, and you can't call submit on it? (for instance with ajax and flash uploaders)

2011-05-27T07:09:01  <RossPatterson> rpk: You mean, like, change the repo that a working copy is connected to?  Not really, and it's certainly not for the faint of heart.
2011-05-27T07:09:26  <rpk> Ok, well I'm certainly open to suggestions
2011-05-27T07:11:36  <eranm> rpk: There's an alternative. It will decrease the repository size and everyone will be happier. But it requires some ruby skills.
2011-05-27T07:13:08  <rpk> eranm: we want the whole repository.  Long term we'll probably need to have a local copy we can submit internal patches to, and also merge in changes from the svn trunk.
2011-05-27T07:13:37  <AutomatedTester> rpk: no plans on returning the patches to us?
2011-05-27T07:13:46  <rpk> your the ones requiring a cfl
2011-05-27T07:14:01  <AutomatedTester> cfl?
2011-05-27T07:14:04  <rpk> or csl, or whatever that license agreement is to send patches
2011-05-27T07:14:09  <AutomatedTester> cla
2011-05-27T07:14:14  <eranm> rpk: the repository is now huge in part because of the Gecko SDK. If we get a ruby subroutine that fetches it from the Mozilla website and unpacks it, the size will decrease significantly.
2011-05-27T07:14:36  <rpk> we have people interested in submitting patches / bugs, but legal will never approve it for our business unit
2011-05-27T07:15:12  <eranm> What would they have difficulty with?
2011-05-27T07:15:17  <rpk> eranm, I think we might end up with an hg repo encapsulating it, its not like we don't have the space
2011-05-27T07:15:30  <rpk> eranm: It would expose them to more 'risk'
2011-05-27T07:15:43  <AutomatedTester> rpk: a cla removes risk...
2011-05-27T07:15:44  <rpk> (we can't even use gpl'd software anymore)
2011-05-27T07:16:17  <rpk> AutomatedTester: do you think legal will see it that way?
2011-05-27T07:16:39  <AutomatedTester> well, signing the CLA removes ownership and passes it back to our project
2011-05-27T07:16:46  <rpk> If you do, I'd encourage selenium to approach oracle, there are probably at least 1000 people using watir or selenium
2011-05-27T07:17:36  <AutomatedTester> rpk: so no open source software in Oracle?
2011-05-27T07:17:39  <rpk> AutomatedTester: I'm aware of what it does.  I just doubt legal will see it the same way, and our business unit simply isn't significant enough
2011-05-27T07:17:57  <rpk> We can use apache, MIT, BSD, cpl (i think thats it), and a couple others
2011-05-27T07:18:04  <pngl> Is it possible to use the Selenium 1 and WebDriver API at the same time? Ideally i'd like to be able to convert my Selenium::WebDriver into a Selenium::Client at will.
2011-05-27T07:18:13  <eranm> The way I see it, legal is there to provide services to the rest of the company, just like IT
2011-05-27T07:18:31  <rpk> basically anything that doesn't require changes pushed back
2011-05-27T07:19:38  <rpk> seriously though, approach them, tell them it will be good press, and improve the tools that their teams are using
2011-05-27T07:20:19  <AutomatedTester> rpk its not up to use to approach... we as users can do the bad press thing though

2011-05-27T08:08:43  <barancev> AutomatedTester: use Eclipse :)
2011-05-27T08:09:07  <AutomatedTester> barancev: i would  but I like having a full head of hair

2011-05-27T08:10:48  <barancev> seriously, I prefer Eclipse for Java, but RubyMine for Ruby

2011-05-27T08:16:22  <pngl> How would you wait for ajax with the WebDriver ruby api?
2011-05-27T08:16:44  <jarib> pngl: the plan is to have the X-backed-Y magic happen on the server side eventually, then it will be available in all languages "for free", more or less

2011-05-27T08:17:35  <jarib> yes, WebDriverBackedSelenium and SeleniumBackedWebDriver
2011-05-27T08:18:20  * jarib is afk
2011-05-27T08:18:23  <pngl> jarib: ok. and those two you mentioned aren't in even ruby yet. Would you advise that I stay with Selenium 1 for a bit longer?
2011-05-27T08:19:50  <sdimkov> currently for my code Im using a wrapper around webdriver where I add waiting by default for my actions. So if I call MyDriver#[ ]  (:xpath => "bla bla")   it first uses WebDriver#find_elements to wait for the given element.

2011-05-27T11:15:07  <threexk> hello.  Is it possible to store just part of a URL into a Selenium variable?  (I am new.)
2011-05-27T11:15:10  *** Mephian has quit IRC
2011-05-27T11:15:26  <RossPatterson> Where's the URL coming from?
2011-05-27T11:15:56  <threexk> the current page.  The URL is like /node/add/visit/309 and I wanted to grab just the "309".
2011-05-27T11:16:15  <RossPatterson> Ah ... with Selenium IDE, right?
2011-05-27T11:16:39  <threexk> yes.  (Sorry, I am not sure of the distinction between Selenium and Selenium IDE.)
2011-05-27T11:17:29  <RossPatterson> Selenium has several components.  Selenium IDE is one of them, but there are others.  New Selenium folks usually are only working with IDE/

2011-05-27T11:17:54  <RossPatterson> Short answer: No.  Long answer: Yes, though a little JavaScript.
2011-05-27T11:19:04  <threexk> OK.  Is it possible to cause Selenium to execute some JavaScript for the current page?
2011-05-27T11:19:08  <threexk> *Selenium IDE
2011-05-27T11:19:27  *** andytinkham has joined #selenium
2011-05-27T11:19:29  <RossPatterson> Selenium's storeLocation command will give you the full URL, not just a part of it.
2011-05-27T11:20:14  <threexk> I wanted to pull part of the URL out (e.g., "309"), and then verify that it exists in the contents on another page
2011-05-27T11:20:36  *** sdimkov has quit IRC
2011-05-27T11:20:44  <RossPatterson> But you can use storeEval to run any JavaScript snippet that you want, and it can access IDE variables, so you can do it that way.  You'd need to write the small bit of JavaScript that parses out the last "/"-separated value.
2011-05-27T11:21:28  <threexk> cool, OK.  thanks
