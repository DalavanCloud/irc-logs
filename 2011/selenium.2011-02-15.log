2011-02-15T04:14:10  <Sandeep_> Hey, Can u help me out for resolving the issue
2011-02-15T04:14:21  <AutomatedTester> will you stop flooding the channel?
2011-02-15T04:14:30  <Sandeep_> not intended
2011-02-15T04:15:28  <AutomatedTester> what happens when you insert commands to try click the element
2011-02-15T04:15:40  <AutomatedTester> the IDE tries to record everything but its impossible to do so
2011-02-15T04:16:31  <Sandeep_> The IDE records evrything but when Replaying it , It does not replays the Checkboxes present grid
2011-02-15T04:16:41  <Sandeep_> present under grid
2011-02-15T04:16:57  <AutomatedTester> do you need to add a waitFor command?
2011-02-15T04:17:11  <Sandeep_> Nope
2011-02-15T04:17:31  <davehunt> Sandeep_: Selenium IDE is not always able to accurately record actions in right Internet applications, you may need to manually add commands
2011-02-15T04:17:50  <davehunt> Hey AutomatedTester, good news on b2 :)
2011-02-15T04:17:50  <Sandeep_> my question is does Selenium supports automating Extended Javascript based application
2011-02-15T04:17:58  <AutomatedTester> thanks
2011-02-15T04:18:20  <davehunt> Sandeep_: I don't understand your question.

2011-02-15T04:20:31  <davehunt> Sandeep_: The simple answer is yes, however how you do it might not be as simple an answer
2011-02-15T04:20:46  <davehunt> AutomatedTester: true, but I'd like the server side upgraded too :)
2011-02-15T04:21:30  <davehunt> Not sure if someone's really owning that in the way I'd hoped. I might be wrong, been a bit disconnected from the Se stuff recently

2011-02-15T05:16:56  <jarib> it saves the state
2011-02-15T05:17:22  <jarib> since /g is for multiple matches
2011-02-15T05:17:27  <jarib> you call it once, you get the first match
2011-02-15T05:17:34  <jarib> call it again, and you get the next match (if any)
2011-02-15T05:17:39  <davehunt> ah

2011-02-15T05:47:09  <jarib> great
2011-02-15T05:47:17  <jarib> you managed to reproduce it?
2011-02-15T05:47:41  <jimevans> yeah, it's a pita to reproduce, because it's totally a timing-related race condition.
2011-02-15T05:47:47  <jarib> yeah
2011-02-15T05:48:37  <jimevans> when you close the window via a link click, the click command tells the session manager that we need to wait for this browser to complete navigation.
2011-02-15T05:49:04  <jimevans> well, when the browser window closes, we delete the browser wrapper object.
2011-02-15T05:49:18  <jimevans> so the thing that has the Wait() method no longer exists.

2011-02-15T06:49:48  <ipmb> AutomatedTester: sorry about the patch on #1288. I'm not sure how to get `svn diff` to properly register an `svn mv`
2011-02-15T06:49:48  <selbot2> theautomatedtester open/started use find_packages in setup.py - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1288
2011-02-15T06:50:29  <AutomatedTester> no worries, so where were you trying to move them?
2011-02-15T06:50:55  <ipmb> svn mv py/test py/selenium/
2011-02-15T06:51:15  <ipmb> they get built as selenium.test, so I'm not sure why they live in a separate directory
2011-02-15T06:51:31  <ipmb> perhaps you can enlighten me :)
2011-02-15T06:52:03  <AutomatedTester> well... the short answer is the setup.py probably does a little too much work
2011-02-15T06:52:25  <AutomatedTester> ideally when I release to pypi I don't want the tests to be released as well
2011-02-15T06:52:36  *** mandric has joined #selenium
2011-02-15T06:52:37  <ipmb> there is a way to exclude packages

2011-02-15T06:53:04  <AutomatedTester> there is...but at the moment it copies the tests when I run the build

2011-02-15T06:53:56  <AutomatedTester> yea i know that
2011-02-15T06:54:07  <AutomatedTester> but the setup.py is something I inherited
2011-02-15T06:54:14  <ipmb> gotcha... perhaps there could be some sort of release flag that toggles that
2011-02-15T06:54:14  <AutomatedTester> and am picking my battles atm
2011-02-15T06:54:39  <ipmb> understood, don't mean to pester, I'd just like to help out
2011-02-15T06:55:04  <AutomatedTester> I love patches...well when they dont delete all my tests :P
2011-02-15T06:55:49  <AutomatedTester> ipmb: I did add a new build step this morning for installing trunk
2011-02-15T06:55:57  <ipmb> ooh, cool
2011-02-15T06:56:06  <AutomatedTester> it builds and moves the correct things to the correct places
2011-02-15T06:56:14  <ipmb> \o/
2011-02-15T06:56:14  <AutomatedTester> to use it its ./go py_install
2011-02-15T06:56:57  <ipmb> I'd love to see `pip install -e svn+http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/#egg=selenium "just work"
2011-02-15T06:57:11  <ipmb> setup.py was the first hurdle there
2011-02-15T06:57:33  <AutomatedTester> sadly since the main part of Selenium is not in Python dunno how much of a reality that will be
2011-02-15T06:58:00  <ipmb> well, setup.py can call ./go py_install
2011-02-15T06:59:25  <AutomatedTester> i am a bit worried that if we do that then if we need to change the build we have to change it in multiple places
2011-02-15T06:59:56  <AutomatedTester> since go is our build batch file
2011-02-15T06:59:59  <ipmb> is it called outside of the Rakefile?

2011-02-15T07:04:30  <ipmb> so the problem is that, in some cases, the build only wants to build one driver, but setup.py would always build all the drivers?
2011-02-15T07:04:56  <AutomatedTester> if you are testing 1 driver you only want it to build 1
2011-02-15T07:05:06  <AutomatedTester> if you are installing it, you want it to build all 3
2011-02-15T07:05:15  <AutomatedTester> well 2 and use the prebuilt for the other
2011-02-15T07:06:24  <AutomatedTester> and the directory structure *may* still be in flux for the core driver code
2011-02-15T07:06:29  * ipmb wonders if you could pass arbitrary flags to setup.py
2011-02-15T07:06:51  <ipmb> yeah, I was going to ask you about the directory structure, it doesn't match trunk
2011-02-15T07:07:11  <AutomatedTester> what doesnt match trunk?
2011-02-15T07:07:50  <ipmb> trunk uses, selenium.webdriver.[browser].webdriver.WebDriver, right?
2011-02-15T07:08:03  <AutomatedTester> ahh that
2011-02-15T07:08:21  <AutomatedTester> I have updated an __init__ so that its not so verbose
2011-02-15T07:08:26  <AutomatedTester> what the "people" asked for
2011-02-15T07:08:39  <ipmb> yeah, it was a lot of "webdriver"s
2011-02-15T07:08:51  <AutomatedTester> have a look in py/selenium/webdriver/__init__.py
2011-02-15T07:09:03  <AutomatedTester> just did some aliasing
2011-02-15T07:09:06  <ipmb> got it
2011-02-15T07:09:29  * ipmb thinks there shouldn't be an __init__.py in py/
2011-02-15T07:10:53  <AutomatedTester> i never noticed that there
2011-02-15T07:12:17  <AutomatedTester> i am hoping in the next few releases of the bindings they will become awesome

2011-02-15T07:40:50  <AutomatedTester> in Se2 you create your profile programatically
2011-02-15T07:40:58  <ipmb> ok, so always client side?

2011-02-15T08:12:10  <mattmtl> using webdriver, what is does the 'id' of an element refers to?

2011-02-15T08:13:25  *** mbeierl has quit IRC

2011-02-15T08:14:54  <jarib> is this python?
2011-02-15T08:14:59  <mattmtl> jarib: yes
2011-02-15T08:15:00  *** mbeierl has joined #selenium
2011-02-15T08:15:11  <jarib> mattmtl: i assume .id works for any object to return the object id
2011-02-15T08:15:19  <jarib> at least that's how it works in ruby.
2011-02-15T08:15:34  <jarib> to get the id attribute, you probably want get_attribute("id")
2011-02-15T08:15:54  <jarib> ah, looks like i'm mistaken
2011-02-15T08:16:18  <mattmtl> but how the element.id is built? does all the dom elements in a page are given an incremental number?
2011-02-15T08:16:51  <jarib> what does it return?
2011-02-15T08:16:58  <mattmtl> u'721'
2011-02-15T08:17:18  <mattmtl> in python it is a unicode (string) type
2011-02-15T08:17:33  <jarib> ok, not sure what that's used for. webdriver does assign a UUID to each element you fetch

2011-02-15T09:03:34  <lawcab> i am new to selenium
2011-02-15T09:03:37  <ato> Good evening.
2011-02-15T09:03:49  <lawcab> i have used other tools out there like watir and watij
2011-02-15T09:04:10  <lawcab> I am looking over some help docs
2011-02-15T09:04:18  <lawcab> and i see 2 ways to script
2011-02-15T09:04:32  <lawcab> one is using the rc
2011-02-15T09:04:51  <lawcab> and the other is using the webdriver
2011-02-15T09:05:08  <lawcab> was my understanding correct? or you use them in conjunction?
2011-02-15T09:05:41  <lawcab> using the java client
2011-02-15T09:07:00  <jimevans> lawcab: your basic understanding is correct.
2011-02-15T09:07:22  <lawcab> what would be the more common way of doing things?
2011-02-15T09:07:26  <jimevans> there are some mechanisms in place that allow you to mix the two, particularly if you're migrating from RC (1.x) to the webdriver (2.0) API.
2011-02-15T09:08:01  <lawcab> I am just starting up so no migration happening
2011-02-15T09:08:13  <lawcab> I have donwloaded latest selenium version
2011-02-15T09:08:27  <jimevans> Right now? RC is more common in the wild, but going forward the 2.0 API is where most of the effort is happening.
2011-02-15T09:09:10  <jimevans> Best practice guidance suggests that if you're in a "green field" project (no prior tests to maintain), the 2.0 (WebDriver) API is the best way to go.
2011-02-15T09:09:14  <lawcab> so if I use webdriver I don;t even need to start up the server right
2011-02-15T09:09:37  <jimevans> If you're running your tests on the local machine, no.
2011-02-15T09:09:51  *** MentalDisruptor has quit IRC

2011-02-15T09:10:48  <lawcab> cause how i am looking into it is start all my test local
2011-02-15T09:10:54  <lawcab> and use watir grid after
2011-02-15T09:17:18  <lawcab> so can I use webdriver
2011-02-15T09:17:32  <lawcab> and run my test on a diverent environment with a server running?
2011-02-15T09:20:32  <jimevans> lawcab: well, using WebDriver, there's the concept of a RemoteWebDriver, which communicates to the selenium server running on a remote machine.
2011-02-15T09:21:28  <xirkus> I was wondering; does anyone know why WebElement does not implement a fluent interface for this void return methods?
2011-02-15T09:22:59  <jimevans> xirkus: what would you like to see?
2011-02-15T09:23:03  <xirkus> s/this/it's/
2011-02-15T09:24:31  <xirkus> WebElement.clear().sendKeys("String").submit();
2011-02-15T09:24:45  <xirkus> instead of separate WebElement method calls.
2011-02-15T09:26:03  <jimevans> I can see how you might want that. Sounds like a wrapper API is in order for you.
2011-02-15T09:26:44  <lawcab> how do i use remotewedriver?
2011-02-15T09:26:56  <xirkus> That's that path I'm following now; I was wondering if there was a technical reason why it is currently not done this way.
2011-02-15T09:27:07  <lawcab> by specifying the url of the server?
2011-02-15T09:27:39  <jimevans> lawcab: exactly. you specify the url of the selenium server in the RemoteWebDriver constructor.
2011-02-15T09:28:00  <jimevans> xirkus: you'd probably want to ask the API designer (simonstewart).

2011-02-15T09:41:59  <jarib> with race conditions like this, perhaps C# is too quick compared to ruby
2011-02-15T09:42:05  <jarib> or something
2011-02-15T09:46:59  <jimevans> jarib: I'm on a different machine than yesterday. What do I need to do to get this to run cleanly (require selenium-webdriver isn't happiness).
2011-02-15T09:49:39  <jarib> what's the message?
2011-02-15T09:49:55  <jarib> did you build //rb:ie ?
2011-02-15T09:50:36  <jarib> if it's a clean ruby install, you probably need to do something like `gem install albacore && rake //rb:install-gems`
2011-02-15T09:50:45  <jarib> (note rake, not go)
2011-02-15T09:50:55  <jarib> then `rake //rb:ie && ruby crash.rb` should do the trick
2011-02-15T09:50:56  <jarib> jimevans: ^^

2011-02-15T11:55:25  <mandric> Is there a way to get selenium to log an error (failed test trace) immediately when it encounters it instead of waiting to print to stdout until all tests are complete?
2011-02-15T11:57:05  <jarib> mandric: sounds like you're using a test framework that's collecting the failures. a pure selenium script would stop immediately AFAIK
2011-02-15T11:57:49  <mandric> this is true .. it might be an artifact of my framework... (looking a bit)
2011-02-15T11:58:47  <mandric> basically i'm using python unittest.TestCase, the selenium python client and nosetests

2011-02-15T13:30:59  <jarib> also check the error console for certificate-related messages
2011-02-15T13:31:15  <jarib> also, what firefox version?

2011-02-15T13:34:11  <jarib> it should work out of the box with firefox.
2011-02-15T13:34:19  <jimevans> the ie drived doesn't do certificates yet.

2011-02-15T13:41:46  <lawcab> thanks jarib and jimevans
2011-02-15T13:42:22  <jarib> jimevans: i'm getting sligtly different behaviour on a 32-bit Win7 VM. on the second run it doesn't crash, but driver.window_handles only returns a single window
2011-02-15T13:42:38  <jarib> so it raises the "not found" message
2011-02-15T13:42:44  <jarib> i added a sleep after clicking "open"
2011-02-15T13:42:53  <jarib> to make sure the window is really there
2011-02-15T13:43:57  *** lamdk has joined #selenium
2011-02-15T13:45:23  <jarib> ah, there i got a crash
2011-02-15T13:45:30  <jimevans> jarib: make sure protected mode is off for all zones on this machine and see if that makes a difference. i have a theory about that too.
2011-02-15T13:45:40  <jarib> ah, right
2011-02-15T13:46:27  <jimevans> as far as i can tell, protected mode is always off for the file:// protocol
2011-02-15T13:47:11  <jimevans> when we first launch the browser, protected mode is set to whatever the settings for "intranet" are (because we start by browsing to localhost:<serverport>)
2011-02-15T13:47:49  <jimevans> if protected mode is "on" for intranet, then you browse to the local file, you have a protected-mode context switch, which puts you in a bad state.
2011-02-15T13:48:12  <jimevans> however, that has nothing to do with the crash.
2011-02-15T13:48:44  <jarib> i turned off protected mode, didn't seem to change things
2011-02-15T13:49:20  <jarib> jimevans: did you have to modify the script in order for it to actually find the window? i'm hitting the raise "not found" line here
2011-02-15T13:49:35  <jarib> may be just this machine + VM that's too slow..
2011-02-15T13:50:06  <jimevans> no, it finds it just fine for the first iteration.
2011-02-15T13:50:37  *** mbeierl has quit IRC
2011-02-15T13:51:14  *** nirvdrum has joined #selenium
2011-02-15T13:51:15  <jarib> hmm
2011-02-15T13:51:17  <jimevans> the crash is happening because we launch IE using the IELaunchURL API to find the "real" process id of the IE process.
2011-02-15T13:51:25  <jarib> this is slightly different
2011-02-15T13:51:51  <jarib> i changed the    raise "not found"   line to be    if handle
2011-02-15T13:52:16  <jarib> so that if the window is not found, it will just jump to driver.quit
2011-02-15T13:52:23  <jarib> now
2011-02-15T13:52:32  <jarib> first iteration is all good
2011-02-15T13:52:52  <jarib> second iteration, driver.window_handles returns only a single window
2011-02-15T13:53:15  <jarib> however the second window does open. when driver.quit is called, that second window is left open
2011-02-15T13:53:43  <jarib> third iteration (with the closeable window left open from the previous iteration), it crashes
2011-02-15T13:54:06  <lawcab> is there a recomended java version for the server?
2011-02-15T13:54:18  <jimevans> the symptoms of the second iteration have all of the earmarks of a protected mode context switch.
2011-02-15T13:54:49  <jarib> lawcab: 1.6 (though 1.5 should also work i believe)
2011-02-15T13:54:53  <jarib> jimevans: hmm
2011-02-15T13:55:03  <jimevans> the third iteration crashes because we get the window handle of the IE instance from the process, and get an IHTMLDocument2 from the window handle.
2011-02-15T13:55:38  <jarib> i have protected mode off for all zones
2011-02-15T13:55:40  <jimevans> we try to call the equivalent of .parentWindow() on the document. If it succeeds, we can get the IWebBrowser2 object, and life is good.
2011-02-15T13:56:09  <jimevans> but it's failing, so we never get the IWebBrowser2, so you try to access a null pointer when you navigate and crash
2011-02-15T13:56:44  <jimevans> jarib: I'm sure you do have protected mode off for all zones; that's just what the symptoms sound like. :)
2011-02-15T13:56:51  <jarib> ah
2011-02-15T13:56:54  <jarib> what?
2011-02-15T13:56:56  <jarib> heh
2011-02-15T13:57:50  <jimevans> this all used to be *so* much easier...
2011-02-15T13:57:59  <jarib> but it shouldn't context switch then, right?
2011-02-15T13:58:19  <jimevans> no, it shouldn't. i don't know what's going on there. yet.
2011-02-15T13:58:50  <jarib> also, security level is set to medium for all zones except "restricted sites", which i can't change
2011-02-15T13:58:53  <jarib> that's ok, right?
2011-02-15T13:59:19  <jimevans> as far as i'm aware, security level has no effect on what we're doing.
