2011-07-28T02:08:51  <Yaroon> Is it possible to have Selenium open new browser windows when it starts? Instead of always starting a new browser session?
2011-07-28T02:09:32  <Yaroon> Let's say your browser's already running. Starting a test always starts a new browser session. But I'd like it to use the already running browser session.

2011-07-28T03:33:22  <andreashaas> Hi, when I get the code from the repository and I start 'go.bat test_ie' on Windows 7, already the first test fails with a NoSuchElementException. I think it is because WebDriver.get(page) does not wait until the page is loaded. What can I do to make the tests work?
2011-07-28T03:34:20  *** rbalent has quit IRC
2011-07-28T03:34:21  <eranm> andreashaas, have a look at TestWaiter.waitFor
2011-07-28T03:34:40  <eranm> grep through the code for sample usage
2011-07-28T03:35:25  <eranm> But note that if the element in question is part of a static content that would otherwise be present when get() returns, it means IE is returning from get() prematurely.

2011-07-28T05:45:32  <jarib> pngl: driver.save_screenshot and driver.screenshot_as should work if the driver supports them

2011-07-28T05:48:07  <jarib> those shouldn't be private, that's a doc error
2011-07-28T05:48:50  <pngl> jarib: ah ok, yes I was able to find that in the code. The doc should probably show those modules as included.

2011-07-28T09:17:44  <new2b2> I have the regular Selenium script that sets up the browsers and whatnot. This script calls functionA inside it. functionA is located in its own file. is it possible for functionA to know where to run selenium commands if i pass the 'self.driver to it?. Or will I have to get the session ID and then pass session ID and specify that sessionid is where the function should be aiming at?

2011-07-28T09:47:49  <hubc> simonstewart: ah, sorry. The one where when you try to click on an element in an IE window when it is out of focus, it doens't actually click the element but it just brings the window to focus
2011-07-28T09:47:58  <lawcab> ok
2011-07-28T09:48:03  <lawcab> have a question
2011-07-28T09:48:10  <lawcab> i have 2 select boxes
2011-07-28T09:48:18  <lawcab> same options
2011-07-28T09:48:36  *** AutomatedTester has quit IRC
2011-07-28T09:48:41  <lawcab> but the select boxes itself have different ids
2011-07-28T09:49:35  <lawcab> so what i did was driver.findElement(By.id("idof1")).findElement(By.xpath("someexpath").click
2011-07-28T09:49:53  <lawcab> then next line is driver.findElement(By.id("idof2")).findElement(By.xpath("someexpath").click
2011-07-28T09:50:05  <lawcab> first statement selected on select1
2011-07-28T09:50:25  <lawcab> but second statement still selected the first one
2011-07-28T09:50:42  <lawcab> is there a properway to do this?

2011-07-28T11:55:56  <esotericbyte> long: Hello!  *Situation*:  I have the python remote and the server installed. I just don't have time to script getting into the system at this point just yet. I am writing a python script that genrates selenese / html script.  *Problem*: I need to encode html to be posted into a text area form field. I have created a template. What do I use to encode the test data for the "type" selenese command.

2011-07-28T11:59:41  <esotericbyte> Sorry to ask such a nube question but the search space is very cowed. taranslate /convert focuses on translating selenese html to python remote code for example.
2011-07-28T12:04:34  *** dhackner has quit IRC
2011-07-28T12:05:05  <eranm> esotericbyte, if you're using Python, you may as well use the WebDriver python bindings.
2011-07-28T12:07:05  <eranm> There may be an answer to your question, but not many here are familiar with Selenese.
2011-07-28T12:09:20  <esotericbyte> the issue with using anything directed by python is that I can't navigate to where I want the scripts to start and for various reasons including security i don't want to script it
2011-07-28T12:10:28  <esotericbyte> i mean .. it seems that using remote or the driver you can't just tell it to start on the page you are on. if that will work i can do it that way though.. . maybe i should just try something like urlencode

2011-07-28T13:33:25  <Siph0n> I sometimes think my button wasn't clicked, but I keep working and it finally goes... sometimes I dont wait and just click it manually..
2011-07-28T13:33:55  <Siph0n> Maybe on those times I click it manually it wasn't actually clicked... not sure.
2011-07-28T13:34:04  <jarib_> so could be another issue (maybe fixed since b3)
2011-07-28T13:34:57  <hubc> jarib_: it might be another issue, but it seems to happen randomly on my tests (when i have several running at a time) my screenshots show forms not being submitted and my "find_elements" time out because it's not on the right page
2011-07-28T13:35:57  <jarib_> does it happen when you run the tests serially as well?
2011-07-28T13:39:25  <hubc> if i run one at a time, no
2011-07-28T13:39:43  <hubc> that's why i'm trying to use grid
2011-07-28T13:39:56  <hubc> so i can just send tests to the server and then let grid handle which ones are run
2011-07-28T13:40:08  <hubc> but grid keeps dropping my sessions for whatever reason :(

2011-07-28T14:00:37  <hubc> what he's saying is they wanted the enter button to do something special

2011-07-28T14:03:59  <DocD2> http://jira.openqa.org/browse/SIDE-36 suggests it should work

2011-07-28T15:56:37  <esotericbyte> Is this a triggered window or has it been  for awhile before testing?  The title matches ...  The issue I've found is usually related to timing. Have you tried adding a long... even ridiculously long wait ?
2011-07-28T15:57:31  <esotericbyte> Delgadll: forgot to address that to you. Sorry.
2011-07-28T16:01:27  <Delgadill> im on annohter site and i have to click on help. this help opens a new tab in firefox

2011-07-28T16:04:03  <esotericbyte> did you try this ? http://bit.ly/peZ0jf i did not look at the details
2011-07-28T16:05:00  <esotericbyte> Delgadill: it just looked promising
2011-07-28T16:05:00  <Delgadill> let me give it a try
2011-07-28T16:05:05  <esotericbyte> cool

2011-07-28T16:07:28  <esotericbyte> hum. Is it possible to start a remote script ( i am using python) and have it  pick up where  I  leave off browsing?  With the IDE I can start tests anywhere and delete the setup.  If it's not possible to interact with an existing browser could i open the home page and then put in a long wait or a wait for text / element present so that I can navigate manually a bit before it really starts to go?

2011-07-28T17:37:48  <cheezy> I need to switch to a window -> have the page title
2011-07-28T17:37:58  <cheezy> I found the window_handles method to get all handles
2011-07-28T17:38:17  <cheezy> and the TargetLocator#window method to switch to a window using the handle
2011-07-28T17:38:34  <cheezy> but I cannot seem to determine which handle belongs to which window
2011-07-28T17:39:24  <cheezy> anybody have some pointers?
