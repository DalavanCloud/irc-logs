2011-06-01T01:50:18  <bcave> hi
2011-06-01T01:51:27  <bcave> with selenium ide, is there a way to configure it to use true xpaths when recording? We are recording test cases, and the elements seem to not always be true xpaths.
2011-06-01T01:52:31  <bcave> e.g. if i click a link that is <a href="/somepage">Some Page</a>, then IDE records it as "link=Some page", whereas it should be a proper xpath, referencing specific DOM elements....
2011-06-01T01:52:58  <bcave> ide version 1.0.10

2011-06-01T02:07:24  <binken> <bcave> you can use some tools do this
2011-06-01T02:07:49  <binken> Under firefox, you could use xpath viewer

2011-06-01T02:08:32  <bcave> some tools to fix the tool ? :p
2011-06-01T02:09:19  <bcave> the thing is, we have testers who aren't very technical, so they just hit "record" and off they go.
2011-06-01T02:10:00  <AutomatedTester_> bcave: uninstall the IDE and show them how to use a programming language...
2011-06-01T02:10:12  <AutomatedTester_> teach them to fish rather than giving them fish
2011-06-01T02:10:19  <bcave> also, i've written a custom format, so the test cases are in java / groovy type code. if they don't have to fiddle in the source, there's less likely to break
2011-06-01T02:10:37  <bcave> haha - if we taught them to develop, we'd probably rather move them out of testing
2011-06-01T02:10:41  <bcave> and into dev
2011-06-01T02:11:13  <AutomatedTester_> bcave: and...
2011-06-01T02:11:17  <bcave> i get your point  AutomatedTester_, we're a bit strained for resources at the moment, including training time

2011-06-01T02:30:48  <AutomatedTester> there are frame tests failing... which makes no sense to me since they pass on other platforms

2011-06-01T02:35:46  <AutomatedTester> they locked the browser.
2011-06-01T02:36:25  <eranm> No, Firefox was left frozen with the title "Alerts tests" so I mistakenly assumed it has anything to do with the alerts tests. However, what happened was that theses were the last tests to run and the browser just remained frozen
2011-06-01T02:36:45  <AutomatedTester> interesting...
2011-06-01T02:36:47  <eranm> The actual failures I saw in the console were of the frame switching tests
2011-06-01T02:36:56  <AutomatedTester> they are always the first on my machine
2011-06-01T02:37:24  <eranm> When I broke out of the test_py command the browser terminated

2011-06-01T03:36:18  <eranm> barancev, modifyWindowToRecordPopUpDialogs in selenium-browserbot.js is the function that's called to override window.alert with a function to store the alert's data. Simon is looking into it but if you want to independently have a look, backtrack the usage of this function to see where a new window gets modified with Selenium's handlers.

2011-06-01T06:09:04  <simonstewart> Also there are amusing minute long timeouts in some of the tests
2011-06-01T06:10:25  <ato> simonstewart: We need to discuss how to do vendor-specific extensions to WebDriver at some point.
2011-06-01T06:10:42  <ato> simonstewart: (Oh, and we've signed the bloody CLAs, will you look at Stuk's patch to the tests?)
2011-06-01T06:10:59  <simonstewart> :)
2011-06-01T06:11:03  <simonstewart> Yes and yes
2011-06-01T06:11:26  <simonstewart> The vendor specific plan for the REST API is to just have a namespaced area
2011-06-01T06:11:44  <simonstewart> The API side can be managed using interfaces
2011-06-01T06:11:52  <simonstewart> (well, that's how I'm thinking of it)
2011-06-01T06:12:11  <ato> One that is specifically typed out then, I assume, not automatically just passed on?
2011-06-01T06:12:31  <simonstewart> I'm not sure I get what you mean
2011-06-01T06:12:39  <ato> I think it sounds reasonable, we just need to specify that “this is what we'll be doing”.

2011-06-01T06:12:45  <simonstewart> OK.
2011-06-01T06:12:47  <ato> Because I _really_ want for Opera to move away from using JRuby.
2011-06-01T06:12:50  <simonstewart> I can email the mailing list :)
2011-06-01T06:13:02  <simonstewart> towards Real Ruby?
2011-06-01T06:13:04  <ato> Yes, I considered starting a new thread, but I need to read some code first.
2011-06-01T06:13:06  <ato> Yep.
2011-06-01T06:13:13  <ato> JRuby is good in a lot of ways, but a hazzle to set up.
2011-06-01T06:13:36  <ato> So we also want to be using watir-webdriver, so we need to have the vendor-specific extension discussions on both WebDriver and the Watir side.
2011-06-01T06:13:42  <ato> jarib: ^--
2011-06-01T06:15:56  <ato> There are two obstacles for us currently: Extensions and ecmascript-debugger, which I talked to you about.
2011-06-01T06:16:17  <ato> So I've got selenium-webdriver working, but waiting for a core dev to figure out what the hell is wrong with ecmascript.
2011-06-01T06:16:21  <simonstewart> The ecmascript-debugger thing sounds nasty
2011-06-01T06:16:40  <ato> Yes, I'm going to spend the rest of this week coming up with proper test cases for it.
2011-06-01T06:16:47  <ato> Sniper TCs ftw.

2011-06-01T06:51:12  <simonstewart> Also, the chrome driver is ridiculously fast
2011-06-01T06:51:14  <eranm> jarib, as far as I can see under rake-tasks/crazy_fun/mappings/mozilla.rb we should add a check GeckoSDKExists
2011-06-01T06:51:42  <eranm> and in this check, if the gecko sdk is missing, fetch it
2011-06-01T06:51:52  <AutomatedTester_> simonstewart: would be good to benchmark it against other browsers

2011-06-01T06:54:24  <jarib> eranm: does all xpis built need the gecko sdk though? perhaps it would make sense to have a "gecko2" task that other tasks can depend on
2011-06-01T06:54:35  <threexk1> Is there a preferred file extension for Selenium IDE test cases/suites?
2011-06-01T06:54:43  <jarib> e.g. the stuff in Rakefile:{228,258} ?
2011-06-01T06:55:19  <simonstewart> tanepiper: which browser are you using?
2011-06-01T06:55:24  <simonstewart> Firefox 4
2011-06-01T06:55:25  <eranm> At the moment it does not have a dependency on the gecko SDK, which is a problem
2011-06-01T06:55:27  <simonstewart> Sorry
2011-06-01T06:55:33  <simonstewart> Which version of selenium are you using?
2011-06-01T06:55:40  <simonstewart> 2.0b3?
2011-06-01T06:56:00  <tanepiper> b2
2011-06-01T06:56:24  <jarib> eranm: "it"?
2011-06-01T06:56:50  <simonstewart> b3 introduced better firefox 4 support, so try upgrading to that
2011-06-01T06:56:54  <eranm> it = the dll rule in the Rakefile you pointed to
2011-06-01T06:57:05  <jarib> aye
2011-06-01T06:57:16  <tanepiper> i tried it in chromium too, but due to the proxying i'm getting SSL certificate issues, even though i installed their certificate manually as well
2011-06-01T06:57:43  <simonstewart> OK. First step: update to the latest available version of selenium
2011-06-01T06:57:46  <tanepiper> simonstewart: thanks, i'll give it try
2011-06-01T06:57:49  <eranm> jarib, having a Gecko2 task actually makes sense
2011-06-01T06:57:52  <simonstewart> Good luck :)
2011-06-01T06:58:29  <eranm> simonstewart, I'm testing your recent fix now on Linux and if it passes, we can do the release
2011-06-01T06:58:48  <jarib> eranm: right, so targets could just do :deps => "gecko2" and that will make sure it's downloaded
2011-06-01T06:59:04  <tanepiper> oh wait, it is the b3 jar we have in there :/
2011-06-01T06:59:11  <tanepiper> although the selenium control panel says b2
2011-06-01T06:59:50  <jarib> simonstewart: the dll() task in rake-tasks/c.rb:5 seems calls build_deps_(args[:deps]), will that work if it's passed the name of a normal rake task?
2011-06-01T07:00:01  <tanepiper> yea, sorry it is b3
2011-06-01T07:00:02  <tanepiper> 15:08:36.487 INFO - v2.0 [b3], with Core v2.0 [b3]
2011-06-01T07:00:17  <jarib> build_deps_ is in rake-tasks/task-gen.rb:47, not sure what it really does
2011-06-01T07:01:13  <tanepiper> ok, weird - just restarted selenium and it's started working
2011-06-01T07:01:20  <jarib> simonstewart: the $targets var doesn't seem to be populated anywhere
2011-06-01T07:01:38  <simonstewart> jarib: in what context?
2011-06-01T07:01:43  <jarib> [16:08]      jarib : simonstewart: the dll() task in rake-tasks/c.rb:5 seems calls build_deps_(args[:deps]), will that work if it's passed the name of a normal rake task?
2011-06-01T07:01:50  <jarib> that context :)
2011-06-01T07:02:12  <simonstewart> sounds like we missed something, then
2011-06-01T07:02:26  <jarib> build_deps_ is in rake-tasks/task-gen.rb:47
2011-06-01T07:02:55  <eranm> The comment above it says it's not working out or dependencies correctly
2011-06-01T07:03:20  <tanepiper> and now it breaks again :/  even with a restart.  I'll try track it down and see if i can raise a bug issue
2011-06-01T07:03:54  <simonstewart> Thank you
2011-06-01T07:04:11  <jarib> eranm: would it be useful if i start with writing the "gecko2" task?
2011-06-01T07:04:21  <jarib> and we can figure out how to properly depend on it later..
2011-06-01T07:04:56  <eranm> yes
2011-06-01T07:05:38  <eranm> Very useful, actually. Have a look at cpp/build.desc, the mozilla_xpt target (which already lives under crazy_fun) can depend on it
2011-06-01T07:05:53  <jarib> aha, cool
2011-06-01T07:05:56  <eranm> and once it's written I'll migrate the dll build rule to live under crazy_fun as well and it could depend on it
2011-06-01T07:06:04  <jarib> what URL do we download?
2011-06-01T07:06:24  <eranm> jarib, http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/2.0/sdk/xulrunner-2.0.en-US.linux-i686.sdk.tar.bz2
2011-06-01T07:06:35  <eranm> it's from here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko_SDK
2011-06-01T07:06:59  <jarib> ok
2011-06-01T07:07:19  <eranm> Since the Gecko SDK for Linux is the largest one, you may choose to start with it, but the size of the source tree will decrease no matter which SDK you choose :)
2011-06-01T07:07:24  *** andialbrecht is now known as andialbrecht_
2011-06-01T07:07:41  <jarib> sounds good
2011-06-01T07:07:53  <jarib> and we want it unpacked in third_party/gecko2/linux?
2011-06-01T07:08:18  <eranm> Yes
2011-06-01T07:09:20  <eranm> the download unpacks to xulrunner-sdk/... and we'd want the contents of that directory to live under third_party/gecko2/linux (so xulrunner-sdk/bin lives in third_party/gecko2/linux/bin, etc)
2011-06-01T07:09:39  <jarib> i see
2011-06-01T07:10:17  <jarib> question is, can we expect `tar` to be available
2011-06-01T07:10:30  <jarib> or would we need to do it ourselves
2011-06-01T07:12:09  <simonstewart> jarib: imagine you're on a Windows box
2011-06-01T07:12:14  <simonstewart> tar won't be there
2011-06-01T07:12:27  <simonstewart> If you're sure you're on linux, then you can rely on it being there
2011-06-01T07:12:28  <jarib> exactly.
2011-06-01T07:14:13  <eranm> For windows there's a different download, a zipped one. I imagine Ruby has a built-in zip support?
2011-06-01T07:15:22  <jarib> it doesn't, but we have the rubyzip gem bundled AND we're running on jruby
2011-06-01T07:15:30  <jarib> so all of java's stdlib is available
2011-06-01T07:16:01  <eranm> Very handy
2011-06-01T07:17:12  <jarib> ok, so MMF is just downloading the linux sdk and shelling out to `tar`
2011-06-01T07:17:18  <jarib> so that's what i'll do
2011-06-01T07:17:37  <simonstewart> Hang on
2011-06-01T07:17:49  <simonstewart> are we talking about downloading stuff at compile time?
2011-06-01T07:18:01  <jarib> moving gecko out, yes
2011-06-01T07:18:10  <jarib> it's just the first time you build
2011-06-01T07:18:21  <simonstewart> That's one of the most annoying things about maven
2011-06-01T07:18:40  <simonstewart> I'd rather try and slim down what we have in there
2011-06-01T07:18:48  <simonstewart> Most of the binaries can be deleted
2011-06-01T07:18:56  <simonstewart> The IDL files are practically identical

2011-06-01T07:27:45  <eranm> tip of the day: strip(1) will strip out symbols for you from an existing library. Now, let's see if it actually works without the symbols.

2011-06-01T07:36:29  <jimevans> it reacts to ctrl+v in a way i didn't expect.

2011-06-01T07:37:32  <jimevans> note to self: update the IRC client to not do that.
2011-06-01T07:38:09  <tanepiper> simonstewart: i regressed my vm back to FF3.6 and it works fine with b3, so maybe still some issues with FF4 :/

2011-06-01T07:38:20  <tanepiper> but at least i can move on from here
2011-06-01T07:38:28  <simonstewart> tanepiper: quite possibly

2011-06-01T07:43:01  <jimevans> the problem is that the SP1 installation sometimes fails to update atlcom.h.
2011-06-01T07:43:31  <jimevans> there seems to be some conflicting evidence as to exactly *which* update fixes it, so I'd just apply all of 'em.

2011-06-01T08:03:05  <liebrand> hi guys; quick question about test case management. Selenium is great for writing automated tests, but what systems do people use to manage these tests (other than just files on a hard disk)?  I had a look at bromine which sounded promising but doesn't feel quite product quality just yet... are there other tools around that people can recommend?

2011-06-01T08:20:39  <rpk> Its probably your best option, bromine doesn't seem ready yet
2011-06-01T08:20:40  <liebrand> can't believe there are so few test case management systems out there that integrate with automated tools like selenium actually
2011-06-01T08:20:53  <rpk> yeah, that was me, last week
2011-06-01T08:21:09  <rpk> I was like, what, theres no tools to manage tests / results / run distributed tests against grid
2011-06-01T08:21:22  <rpk> but yeah, basically no.

2011-06-01T08:22:25  <liebrand> rpk: this looked promising: http://www.gurock.com/testrail/
2011-06-01T08:22:34  <liebrand> but then seems to only do manual tests!?! sigh
2011-06-01T08:22:40  <jarib> eranm: yep
2011-06-01T08:22:51  <eranm> If your test is code, you don't need anything special for the test cases. For test results, that's a different problem. We have an in-house system for it
2011-06-01T08:23:35  <rpk> liebrand: Go build a nice open source test suite to meet your needs, and then make it available by the MIT license.  Hope that it reaches maturity, and becomes part of the selenium project.
2011-06-01T08:23:59  <liebrand> hehe yeah i'd be right on it if there were 32 hours in a day ;-)
2011-06-01T08:24:25  <rpk> lol
2011-06-01T08:24:43  <jimevans> writing a good test case management is bloody *hard*.
2011-06-01T08:24:52  <jimevans> especially since you can't seem to please everybody.
2011-06-01T08:24:53  <liebrand> eranm: i'd want to weigh test cases, tag them, and then be able to create  test suites based on selection criteria, which should then be able to be run daily/weekly/etc, with result history kept, and email notifications for when things break...
2011-06-01T08:25:11  <rpk> actually we have a mostly complete tool that does those things in house too
2011-06-01T08:25:20  <liebrand> jimevans: totally agree; just would have thought more people would have tried
2011-06-01T08:25:24  <rpk> sad that no one has time to build one open source tool that everyone could contribute
2011-06-01T08:25:30  <rpk> ^to
2011-06-01T08:25:37  <eranm> liebrand, a perfectly reasonable requirement - we achieve that by annotating the tests and having test suite builders based on these annotations
2011-06-01T08:26:20  <eranm> rpk, I just find it's tied to the environment - if you could mandate one language, one test runner, it would be no problem writing such a thing.
2011-06-01T08:26:23  <rpk> Oh, how are you guys injecting different browsers into the tests? builder?  Is there a reason why I can't specify the capabilities to run the grid on as a parameter?

2011-06-01T09:57:45  <XCulver> junit/nunit checks that a condition is true, example: a webobject exists, or that the text is equal to something else
2011-06-01T09:57:54  <XCulver> there is

2011-06-01T10:35:22  <barancev> why findElement(By.cssSelector("div#tabs ul.ui-tabs-nav li.nth-of-type(3)")) does not throw exception, while findElement(By.cssSelector("div#tabs ul.ui-tabs-nav")).findElement(By.cssSelector("li.nth-of-type(3)")) throws as expected?
2011-06-01T10:35:47  <jarib> polm: Selenium 2 includes two different APIs/technologies
2011-06-01T10:36:16  <barancev> li.nth-of-type(3) should be li:nth-of-type(3), but selenium hangs in findElement instead of reporting illegal css selector
2011-06-01T10:36:18  <jarib> polm: we encourage new users to use the WebDriver API. it's a lot nicer.
2011-06-01T10:36:30  <jarib> polm: both the API and the underlying code
2011-06-01T10:36:46  <barancev> where and when css selectors are parsed and checked?

2011-06-01T10:43:05  <dapidmini> is it possible to know the id or name of a button in a website without using selenium IDE?
2011-06-01T10:43:45  <dapidmini> or can I build test cases partly using selenium IDE and partly by coding?
2011-06-01T10:44:40  <sdimkov> dapidmini: all need to do is "inspect" the element in the html. If using chrome just right-click-inspect-element. With firefox or IE you can use firebug plugin.

2011-06-01T10:49:12  <jarib> jimevans: things that worked earlier are not working now, even on the same rev as before. i'll reboot my VM
2011-06-01T10:49:37  <dapidmini> i've read an example by Felipe Knorr but in his example, JUnit only shows 1/1 as a result even though the test case consists of typing text, clicking buttons, and waiting for a page to load.

2011-06-01T10:51:51  <simonstewart_> dapidmini: the tests are there to check that a specific function of your code or application works as intended
2011-06-01T10:52:04  <simonstewart_> So rather than saying whether every individual command works
2011-06-01T10:52:15  <simonstewart_> they just say whether the test as a whole passed
2011-06-01T10:52:30  <simonstewart_> With JUnit 4, any method annotated with "@Test" is a single test
2011-06-01T10:52:50  <simonstewart_> And the output of the runner will be the number of these annotated methods that passed or failed

2011-06-01T11:21:04  <barancev> simonstewart_: when I use window handles, all correct
2011-06-01T11:21:44  <simonstewart_> interesting

2011-06-01T11:38:51  <jarib> jleyba: was it a deliberate decision to turn off path expansion in the capabilities maps? so {"chrome.foo": "bar"} over {"chrome": {"foo":"bar"}}
2011-06-01T11:38:57  <jarib> AutomatedTester_: gone? that doesn't sound good :)

2011-06-01T11:40:06  <jleyba> jarib: yes and no
2011-06-01T11:41:02  <jarib> haha :)
2011-06-01T11:41:56  <jarib> jleyba: are you going to change it back before exposing it in java, is what i'm really asking
2011-06-01T11:43:06  <jarib> because if these things change around and the clients have to support multiple versions of the server..that's won't be super fun
2011-06-01T11:43:39  <jarib> i'd like to expose passing custom switches in this ruby release, since you uploaded the new server
2011-06-01T11:43:46  <jleyba> I'm actually not sure what you're talking about :)  I've been out on holiday for 2 weeks
2011-06-01T11:43:49  <jarib> haha
2011-06-01T11:44:14  <jarib> so, the ability to pass custom switches to chrome was added to the server
2011-06-01T11:44:39  <jarib> initially by adding {"chrome": {"customSwitches": ...}} to the capabilities
2011-06-01T11:45:30  <jarib> on May 24 it was changed to {"chrome.switches": ...} instead
2011-06-01T11:46:19  <jarib> and also in the returned capabilities, what used to be {"chrome": {"browserVersion": "..."}} etc is now {"chrome.browserVersion": "..."}
2011-06-01T11:46:27  <jarib> anyway, not a big deal
2011-06-01T11:47:21  <jleyba> Ok, I'll look into it

2011-06-01T11:49:43  <jarib> jleyba: at the top of my feature request list is the ability to detach and leave chrome instances running when the server shuts down
2011-06-01T11:49:45  <tunabum> RossPatterson: guess i already did that (maven). how long does it normally take to get it out there?
2011-06-01T11:49:57  <AutomatedTester_> i think I am just going to remove it
2011-06-01T11:51:05  <jarib> jleyba: ruby people don't use debuggers a lot, so it's a frequent request (to be able to poke around in the browser after a test has failed/finished)
2011-06-01T11:51:38  <RossPatterson> tunabum: That ought to stop the email then!  Not that I care, it's just that the Mavenites seem to think nothing exists until someone updates their repositories. :-)
2011-06-01T11:53:14  <tunabum> RossPatterson: no, i didn't get it out into the public maven repository (only my local)... who normally does that / how long does it take / could I even do it?
2011-06-01T11:54:06  <RossPatterson> tunabum: I don't know, it's not my area of concern.
2011-06-01T11:54:23  <tunabum> ok :)
