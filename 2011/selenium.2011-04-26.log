2011-04-26T01:08:47  <HolyGoat> Something weird happening. Through Selenium RC I fire a click() followed by a wait_for_page_to_load(). The click executes fine, and I see the page opening. After that, it just keeps waiting and eventually results in a timeout.

2011-04-26T04:58:57  <HolyGoat> Hm. Am I understanding correctly that wait_for_page_to_load() is no longer necessary as of webdriver?
2011-04-26T05:06:00  <jarib> HolyGoat: yes and no. there's no such method in the webdriver api, but that doesn't mean you never have to wait for things
2011-04-26T05:06:21  <jarib> what language do you use?
2011-04-26T05:07:02  <jarib> there are other mechanisms for waiting with webdriver
2011-04-26T05:08:52  *** RossPatterson has joined #selenium
2011-04-26T05:08:59  <ato> jarib: How do you trigger things like mouseMove() from watir-webdriver?
2011-04-26T05:11:37  <bebef_1987> hy guys
2011-04-26T05:12:21  <bebef_1987> i need to verify the favicon of a website with selenium
2011-04-26T05:12:51  <jarib> ato: i don't, yet
2011-04-26T05:13:00  <bebef_1987> dose anyone know how to do that?
2011-04-26T05:13:01  <jarib> mostly because there's no implementation for firefox/chrome atm
2011-04-26T05:13:29  <jarib> bebef_1987: i'd probably just skip selenium and use a HTTP lib to get /favicon.ico
2011-04-26T05:13:46  <HolyGoat> jarib: I see. So letting the script sleep is the solution?
2011-04-26T05:13:49  <HolyGoat> I use Python.
2011-04-26T05:14:06  <jarib> HolyGoat: no, sleeping is always bad
2011-04-26T05:14:09  <ato> jarib: Some time ago I changed our #fire_event implementation from using the advanced user interactions API to using JS injection of events because that's what you expect when you tell it to “fire an event”.
2011-04-26T05:14:22  <ato> jarib: So I'm considering how we should expose the “native” stuff.
2011-04-26T05:14:39  <HolyGoat> jarib: What would be a better solution?
2011-04-26T05:15:18  <ato> Explicit waiting, maybe.
2011-04-26T05:15:25  <jarib> HolyGoat: you can either configure implicit waits or wait explicitly
2011-04-26T05:15:37  <jarib> i prefer the latter, and in ruby/java/c# we have helpers for that
2011-04-26T05:15:49  <jarib> not sure what the situation is in python
2011-04-26T05:16:31  <jarib> but basically you have some code that does   wait_until { some_element.is_visible() }
2011-04-26T05:16:57  <jarib> and it polls the DOM for to be in the expected state, or times out
2011-04-26T05:17:20  <HolyGoat> I'll see if I can find something like this for the webdriver api in python, thanks
2011-04-26T05:17:38  <jarib> implicit waits means that it will always poll up until a specified timeout whenever you call driver.find_element()
2011-04-26T05:18:02  <jarib> that can be configured from python i think
2011-04-26T05:18:50  <jarib> though it shouldn't be hard to write a wait_until equivalent in python
2011-04-26T05:20:23  <jarib> ato: right. i think Element#{hover,context_click,double_click} etc makes sense from a watir POV
2011-04-26T05:21:52  <jarib> but for some of the more advanced stuff, not sure we can do any better than what is in webdriver
2011-04-26T05:21:58  <RossPatterson> bebef_1987: In Selenium IDE and Selenium RC, you can't check the favicon.  Selenium 2's WebDriver API might be able to do this, but I don't know for sure.
2011-04-26T05:22:46  <ato> jarib: And consequently Element#mouse_move, etc.?
2011-04-26T05:23:02  <jarib> ato: most of the use cases for fire_event is obsoleted by native events, really
2011-04-26T05:23:12  <jarib> ato: that would be #hover
2011-04-26T05:23:33  <ato> Right, but we still want to keep #fire_event, I hope?
2011-04-26T05:24:20  <jarib> ideally the native event stuff was so good cross-platform/browser that we could remove it
2011-04-26T05:24:51  <ato> I think there's still a use case for being able to trigger synthetic events.
2011-04-26T05:24:52  <jarib> so if there are use cases for fire_event that wouldn't be solved by proper native events, i'd love to hear them :)
2011-04-26T05:24:56  <bebef_1987> RossPatterson:  I m using Selenium RC....
2011-04-26T05:25:24  <ato> jarib: If you want to test ECMAscript events.
2011-04-26T05:25:55  <ato> You have a button, you want to check that native mouseOver and synthetic mouseOver both triggers action.

2011-04-26T05:26:50  <ato> I mean, fire_event is just a helper; but a useful one.
2011-04-26T05:26:55  *** cburroughs has joined #selenium
2011-04-26T05:26:58  <jarib> i see how that would be useful to you guys
2011-04-26T05:27:02  <ato> We could still do execute_script or something.
2011-04-26T05:27:17  <ato> Yeah.
2011-04-26T05:27:30  <jarib> yeah, since that's basically what fire_event is doing
2011-04-26T05:27:33  <ato> It's very explicit for us that native and emulated events are not the same thing.
2011-04-26T05:28:50  <jarib> yep
2011-04-26T05:36:51  <RossPatterson> bebef_1987: Sorry, then, you'll have to do that outside Selenium, as jarib suggested.
2011-04-26T05:37:41  <bebef_1987> Yep... I will try jarib 's way
2011-04-26T05:38:52  <jarib> webdriver doesn't have anything to test favicons either.
2011-04-26T05:39:40  <ato> I've heard a lot of people request that.
2011-04-26T05:40:00  <ato> That's essentially a UI thing, though.
2011-04-26T05:43:20  <RossPatterson> Agreed, it's kinda outside the Selenium baliwick, but given how deeply WebDriver is integrated into the browsers, I didn't know if it could handle it.  I wouldn't have been surprised if it could :-)
2011-04-26T05:47:55  <ato> We will probably add support for doing this in OperaDesktopDriver, but that's an extension of WebDriver specifically for doing UI testing.

2011-04-26T06:09:02  <HolyGoat> Now back to my Selenium 1 tests. Anyone have an idea why a wait_for_page_to_load() is causing a timeout after invoking a click()?
2011-04-26T06:10:15  <RossPatterson> HolyGoat: Are you sure the page actually gets reloaded?  If the click() merely modifies the page (e.g., in some AJAXy fashion), that will happen.
2011-04-26T06:10:48  *** adamgoucher has joined #selenium
2011-04-26T06:10:49  <HolyGoat> RossPatterson: Hm.. this may be the case.
2011-04-26T06:11:37  <HolyGoat> So it would be better to wait for an element to load?
2011-04-26T06:12:07  <RossPatterson> If it's an AJAXy interaction, yes.
2011-04-26T06:12:56  <HolyGoat> This site I'm testing is a complete Ajax mess. It also uses '#' in the URLs.
2011-04-26T06:13:17  <RossPatterson> :-) Then that'll probably work.

2011-04-26T06:18:34  *** dmachi has joined #selenium
2011-04-26T06:23:02  <RossPatterson> Not necessarily.  Waiting for an element to appear is easy.  We wrap our code up into a wrapper called WaitForElementPresent(locator, timeout), but it boils down to selenium.WaitForCondition("selenium.isElementPresent(\"" + locator.Replace("\"", "\\\"") + "\");", timeout);
2011-04-26T06:23:41  <ato> Is the timeout required?
2011-04-26T06:23:45  <ato> Or is there a default value?
2011-04-26T06:23:47  <RossPatterson> The locator.Replace() is to make sure that any double-quotes in the locator get escaped before the JavaScript is created.
2011-04-26T06:25:20  <RossPatterson> ato: Yes.
2011-04-26T06:25:36  <RossPatterson> DOH!  "Yes, it is required."

2011-04-26T06:38:21  <jarib> ok

2011-04-26T06:39:24  <HolyGoat> RossPatterson: Thanks! I'm doing this through RC though. This would require me to reference selenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow(), correct?
2011-04-26T06:39:25  <jimevans> if i go into irb at that point (Ruby 1.9.2p180), and try require 'selenium-webdriver', i receive "no such file to load"
2011-04-26T06:39:56  <jarib> jimevans: ruby 1.9 doesn't append the current working dir to $LOAD_PATH
2011-04-26T06:40:07  <jimevans> that'd explain it then.
2011-04-26T06:40:19  <jarib> jimevans: what i usually do is stay in the top dir and include it on the load path with -I
2011-04-26T06:40:29  <jarib> so `irb -I build\rb\lib -r selenium-webdriver`
2011-04-26T06:40:29  <RossPatterson> HolyGoat: It would, if you were doing something in JavaScript that referenced "window".  In this case, we're calling a Selenium API function directly, so there's no need to do that.
2011-04-26T06:40:33  <jarib> and you should be all set
2011-04-26T06:40:52  <jimevans> gotcha. that should get me going. thatnks

2011-04-26T06:45:24  <HolyGoat> RossPatterson: Ah, so to recap - you subclassed the driver, added your own WaitForElementPresent() which calls the waitForCondition() like that?
2011-04-26T06:48:40  <RossPatterson> Essentially, yes.  In actual fact, we wrote a C# wrapper class, because we do a lot of error handling to get good diagnostic information when RC throws an exception.
2011-04-26T06:49:52  *** ovnimancer has quit IRC
2011-04-26T06:50:40  <HolyGoat> RossPatterson: It seems like we do some overlapping work :) What I do is subclassing the driver and wrap benchmarking code around methods that are relevant for benchmarking.
2011-04-26T06:53:12  <RossPatterson> We chose a wrapper class because we were going to modify almost every method in some way or another.  Most importantly, we wrap every RC call in a try/catch that then captures screenshots on failure and looks for common errors our application can throw, because they're useful in diagnosing test failures.  As a result, we very rarely look at the execution log of a failed test - the exception and the diagnostic data is usually suffi
2011-04-26T06:54:54  <HolyGoat> RossPatterson: So basically you wrap and rethrow exceptions that you get back from the driver?
2011-04-26T07:00:58  <RossPatterson> Yup.  We wrap every RC client method with a call to TryWithScreenCapture(cmd), which is implemented as:
2011-04-26T07:00:58  <RossPatterson> try
2011-04-26T07:00:59  <RossPatterson> {
2011-04-26T07:00:59  <RossPatterson> return cmd();
2011-04-26T07:00:59  <RossPatterson> }
2011-04-26T07:00:59  <RossPatterson> catch (Exception e)
2011-04-26T07:00:59  <RossPatterson> {
2011-04-26T07:01:00  <RossPatterson> CheckCommonProblems();
2011-04-26T07:01:00  <RossPatterson> CaptureArtifacts();
2011-04-26T07:01:01  <RossPatterson> throw;
2011-04-26T07:01:01  <RossPatterson> }
2011-04-26T07:03:12  <RossPatterson> CheckCommonProblems() looks for things like session timed out, unexpected JavaScript alert, our "A bad thing happened, please retry" message, and a few others, and turns them into specific expcetions of our own creation.
2011-04-26T07:03:43  <HolyGoat> Very cool!
2011-04-26T07:04:10  <RossPatterson> CaptureArtifacts() snaps screenshots of all the open windows, and collects the page's original HTML and current DOM.
2011-04-26T07:04:13  <HolyGoat> Will this ever be part of Selenium?
2011-04-26T07:04:48  <RossPatterson> I doubt it.  All of this is for the RC API, and the WebDriver API is the official way of the future.
2011-04-26T07:06:16  <mashiara> I'm actually working on something similar with python and webdriver
2011-04-26T07:06:51  <mashiara> basically on my test methods (using python unittest) I have decorators in style of @dump_source_on_failure @screenshot_on_failure
2011-04-26T07:06:54  <HolyGoat> mashiara: That sounds interesting, particularly as Python is my weapon of choice too :)
2011-04-26T07:07:42  <HolyGoat> mashiara: Do you also wrap exception messages and rethrow more specific exceptions?
2011-04-26T07:07:53  <mashiara> right now all the code is in a private repo as I haven't had the time to refactor the client-specific stuff out but in a few weeks maybe.
2011-04-26T07:08:05  <mashiara> not yet, but I could do it if I wanted
2011-04-26T07:08:42  <RossPatterson> Our primary reason for doing this is that we run about 900 RC tests automatically on every commit.  Our test grid (based on JetBrains' TeamCity system) has to operate without human intervention or observation.
2011-04-26T07:09:30  <HolyGoat> That would open up some possibilities, especially in regard to monitoring. Although maybe a bit fragile if it would depend on textual messages.
2011-04-26T07:09:34  <HolyGoat> RossPatterson: whoa.
2011-04-26T07:10:39  <RossPatterson> Yeah, it takes about 15 jobs and 30 minutes, but it's an awesome canary-in-the-coal-mine.
2011-04-26T07:11:52  <HolyGoat> I can imagine. I'm trying to use Selenium for (fairly tight) integration with Nagios/Opsview
2011-04-26T07:12:41  <HolyGoat> There is some stuff available, but the current solutions just run the test as one unit test. I want performance data over specific steps, readable test results in case of errors etc.
2011-04-26T07:31:46  <HolyGoat> RossPatterson: Your solution worked like a charm, thanks!

2011-04-26T10:31:32  <andytinkham> melter: I believe, though have no hard data to confirm, that the code generators are being changed to use the Selenium-webdriver interface. Not sure if that's what you're looking for for improvements though

2011-04-26T11:23:29  <ivog> i wonder how that process went... some people from testing and qa propse a merge, some vote for it and it gets merged without consultation of the guy who proposed the selenium site in the first place... strange...
2011-04-26T11:23:30  <jarib> ivog: what?
2011-04-26T11:23:38  <jarib> link?
2011-04-26T11:23:55  <ivog> http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/4693/selenium
2011-04-26T11:24:32  <jarib> how did they merge it?
2011-04-26T11:24:59  <ivog> i guess jeff attwood or some stackexchange moderator did the merge
2011-04-26T11:26:08  <jarib> so everyone that committed to the Selenium stackexchange is now committed to the software testing and qa one?
2011-04-26T11:26:21  <ivog> i guess so
2011-04-26T11:27:01  <ivog> i wonder if there's some way things could be turned around probably not
2011-04-26T11:27:03  <sfbrian> that seems wrong
2011-04-26T11:27:13  <jleyba> jarib: do you know if the IE driver takes screenshots?
2011-04-26T11:27:22  <andytinkham> Doesn't look like it quite -- I was already commited to both, but looking at the link, there's a side bar box that shows only 98.6% of people commited to the Selenium one are committed to the QA one (though maybe people have already started pulling their commitments to the QA one)
2011-04-26T11:28:11  <jarib> jleyba: it does. though up until recently not the full page, and i haven't tried since
2011-04-26T11:28:33  <melter> RossPatterson: bugs, lots of bugs
2011-04-26T11:28:43  <jarib> jleyba: r12009
2011-04-26T11:28:43  <melter> RossPatterson: often doesn't even compile
2011-04-26T11:28:46  <selbot2> james.h.evans.jr 12 days ago - JimEvans: Implementing full-size screenshots in IE (up to 65536 x 65536 pixels) - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12009
2011-04-26T11:29:19  <andytinkham> Though at that percentage, it looks like there's only 6 people who committed to the Se stackexchange that aren't committed to the QA one, so I'm guessing people might be pulling support after everyone was added.
2011-04-26T11:29:53  <melter> RossPatterson: for java use of "number" instead of "Number", multiple declarations of the same variable name, use of variables ("${varname}") inside of "regex:", to name 3 off the top of my head
2011-04-26T11:30:43  <melter> RossPatterson: and it's not just java, i looked at perl, ruby, python, they all have problems
2011-04-26T11:30:59  <RossPatterson> melter: If the code doesn't compile, you should open up a bug report at http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list.  That's not "improvement", that's "fix broken stuff".
2011-04-26T11:31:20  *** XCulver has joined #selenium
2011-04-26T11:32:00  <jarib> andytinkham: looks like i was automatically commited. i can uncommit from the ST/QA site now at least, and i didn't commit to it before
2011-04-26T11:32:30  <andytinkham> jarib: Then I'd say that confirms everyone was ported over
2011-04-26T11:33:07  <jarib> yep
2011-04-26T11:33:44  <ivog> i'd probably be hard to reverse this...
2011-04-26T11:34:36  <ivog> jeff attwood posted a message on the selenium site this would probaly be happening and asked to commit / uncommit accordingly, probably someone had to contact him directly in some way...
2011-04-26T11:37:07  <jarib> so basically asking people to uncommit from the site they really want to see happen
2011-04-26T11:37:28  <ivog> yea
2011-04-26T11:38:01  <jarib> ah, at least they sent out an email about the merge
2011-04-26T11:38:03  <ivog> i think he didn't realize that most of the people committed to the selenium proposal don't support this kind of merge
2011-04-26T11:38:27  <ivog> heh, i did uncommit so i didn't receive anything :)
2011-04-26T11:39:34  <ivog> ohwell google groups also has some new interface....

2011-04-26T12:05:20  <barancev> selenium proposal had 400+ votes, it's impossible to uncommit so much in short time
2011-04-26T12:05:48  <barancev> there should be another way to undo this merge
2011-04-26T12:08:11  <andytinkham> Could we make a new proposal around browser automation tools, highlighting the non-testing focuses more? Maybe include things like some of the web developer tools as well that aren't as widely used for testing?
2011-04-26T12:10:28  <jarib> i like that idea
2011-04-26T12:11:52  <ivog> I think it's best for someone to talk to jeff atwood, maybe he doesn't understand how most people committed to the selenium proposal feel about this merge. The selenium proposal is in state closed and it's probably best to reopen it if that somehow would be possible
2011-04-26T12:23:31  <jleyba> Hmm..anyone know why getText() collapses &nbsp;?

2011-04-26T12:40:41  *** miker2 has quit IRC
2011-04-26T12:42:25  <jarib> jleyba: looking at the tests, all space is collapsed, and &nbsp; is treated as a normal space
2011-04-26T12:42:30  <jarib> testGetVisibleShouldCollapseMultipleWhitespacesIntoASingleSpace
2011-04-26T12:42:42  <jarib> do you know the rationale for that?
2011-04-26T12:42:49  <jleyba> Yeah, I realize it's codified in the tests, just not sure why
2011-04-26T12:43:00  <jarib> i mean, nbsp isn't special
2011-04-26T12:43:09  <jarib> all space is collapsed
2011-04-26T12:43:22  <jarib> into a single space
2011-04-26T12:43:53  <jleyba> ignoring nbsp for the moment, I believe that approach isn't correct
2011-04-26T12:44:05  <jleyba> Should we collapse whitespace in a <pre> block?
2011-04-26T12:44:10  <jarib> right
2011-04-26T12:45:06  <jleyba> I'd like to change getText() to behave more like innerText
2011-04-26T12:45:30  <jleyba> With the main differences being we have a stricter difference of which elements to ignore than just display:none, and
2011-04-26T12:45:44  <jleyba> tabs would be normalized as spaces
2011-04-26T12:47:52  <jarib> yeah. and if you do that and look at the failures in the java test suite, perhaps the rationale for collapsing becomes apparent
2011-04-26T12:47:59  <jarib> (or not)
2011-04-26T12:49:27  <jleyba> I suspect the original motivation may be due to handling inconsistencies b/w the browsers
2011-04-26T12:49:51  <jleyba> Which is a moot point now with the atoms
2011-04-26T12:55:00  <jarib> yep, that sounds plausible
2011-04-26T12:56:34  <jleyba> I've got it narrowed down to a one-line change if we decide to change the behavior
2011-04-26T12:57:49  <jarib> did you try the java tests with the change applied?
2011-04-26T12:58:20  <jleyba> Yeah.  It only impacted tests enforcing the "&nbsp; is collapsed" behavior

2011-04-26T15:07:39  <jleyba> Mayank: Selenium IDE is a Firefox add-on.  There may be some IE-specific tools out there, but nothing from the Se project
2011-04-26T15:12:53  <Mayank> jleyba: any that you could name for IE? But it needs to be free - OSS

2011-04-26T15:13:44  <jarib> thanks
2011-04-26T15:14:01  <sfbrian> Mayank: I would suggest getting into Selenium RC if you want to do automation on IE
2011-04-26T15:14:01  <jleyba> Mayank: Sorry, I don't know of any.  I actually never use SeIDE

2011-04-26T15:15:38  <eghm> i know that pain
2011-04-26T15:16:09  <sfbrian> Mayank: unfortunately you would have to give up the ease of record/playback for the power of RC which is much much more powerful than IDE

2011-04-26T15:30:13  <barancev> do you know why http://localhost:2310/common/xhtmlTest.html contains links to css and js that are 404?
2011-04-26T15:31:29  <barancev> they make lots of noise in test_logs
2011-04-26T15:36:44  <barancev> Mayank: you may try TestMaker -- http://www.pushtotest.com/designer

2011-04-26T15:51:29  <jarib> barancev: i have a feeling those css/js references can be safely removed
2011-04-26T15:51:44  <jarib> barancev: may be worth trying and see if any tests fail
2011-04-26T15:51:59  <barancev> Mayank: I've never tried it myself, no warranties :) I don't like software that has installation package of size 0.5GB

2011-04-26T15:55:56  <barancev> jarib: I'll try to remove these links and run tests, but I'd not expect to get rid of failed tests. At least they should not fail earlier :)
2011-04-26T15:59:13  <jarib> jleyba: have you done any testing with a lot of sessions against a single chromedriver server?
2011-04-26T16:01:07  <jleyba> jarib: Not really.  Are you seeing something weird?
2011-04-26T16:01:47  <jarib> nope, just curious
2011-04-26T16:02:26  <jarib> i did try 10 sessions, seemed to work ok
2011-04-26T16:26:48  <barancev> jarib: testShouldBeAbleToFindChildrenOfANode failed if I remove links to JS
2011-04-26T16:27:04  <barancev> jarib: assertThat(importedScripts.size(), equalTo(2));
2011-04-26T16:28:09  <barancev> jarib: looks like this test should be rewritten to find some other elements
