2011-02-28T04:09:44  <davehunt> :)
2011-02-28T04:10:04  <simonstewart> So, the great question is what we want out of the powwow on tuesday
2011-02-28T04:10:58  <davehunt> yeah, just a rough agenda so people know what to expect
2011-02-28T04:11:51  <davehunt> where we are now, what you're proposing, short term plans, long term plans. that kinda thing
2011-02-28T04:12:16  <simonstewart> Sounds good to me.
2011-02-28T04:12:19  <simonstewart> I'll prepare a google doc

2011-02-28T04:13:42  <simonstewart> Firefox 4 needs to come out first
2011-02-28T04:13:50  <davehunt> Soon

2011-02-28T04:26:46  <simonstewart> You know, it's pretty tempting to spin out some of the utility classes we have into their own OSS project
2011-02-28T04:27:38  <simonstewart> I notice that the new grid code has something that smells a lot like the PortProber
2011-02-28T04:27:45  <simonstewart> But which doesn't actually find free ports
2011-02-28T04:27:55  <simonstewart> davehunt: feel free to edit
2011-02-28T04:29:40  <davehunt> simonstewart: the only addition I can think of would be to add 'Mozilla take ownership of existing Firefox Driver'. Does that sound reasonable?

2011-02-28T05:09:38  <nirvdrum> So, should I just expect that full selenium tests no longer pass?  I've been unable to get them to run for months now on Mac.  And now apparently they don't run on my Windows VM either.  I've yet to try in Linux, but I don't suspect I'm going to do better there.

2011-02-28T05:19:15  <simonstewart> Which target are you running?

2011-02-28T05:19:36  <simonstewart> Hmm...
2011-02-28T05:19:39  <simonstewart> The java tests all pass.
2011-02-28T05:19:46  <simonstewart> And I think that the ruby ones do too
2011-02-28T05:19:51  <nirvdrum> It'd be helpful if there were a flag to just continue running on failure, too.
2011-02-28T05:19:55  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: are the python tests green?
2011-02-28T05:20:07  <simonstewart> Yeah, I've heard a lot of people complain about that

2011-02-28T05:20:38  <simonstewart> Please
2011-02-28T05:20:46  <simonstewart> nirvdrum: which tests fail?
2011-02-28T05:20:51  <nirvdrum> Mac is useless because the Firefox focus issue.
2011-02-28T05:20:54  <simonstewart> Or rather, which language binding
2011-02-28T05:21:03  <simonstewart> The java tests are selected to avoid it
2011-02-28T05:21:19  <nirvdrum> Running on Windows again, but I think it had to do with JavascriptEmbeddedSomethingOrOther and then the log was just a bunch of "not yet implemented"
2011-02-28T05:22:04  <simonstewart> Hmmm...
2011-02-28T05:22:15  <nirvdrum> I'll have a solid answer in a few min.
2011-02-28T05:22:27  <simonstewart> I'll run the tests on my windows machine
2011-02-28T05:22:48  <simonstewart> Although I'm on IE 9, and that's causing some tests to fail
2011-02-28T05:22:54  <simonstewart> Which version of firefox are you using?
2011-02-28T05:22:56  <nirvdrum> My process seems to be "svn up", deal with the inevitable merge conflict, run tests, watch them fail, not know if I broke anything, get disheartened, try again another day.
2011-02-28T05:23:11  <nirvdrum> 3.6.13
2011-02-28T05:24:23  <simonstewart> I can see that'd be bloody irratating
2011-02-28T05:24:39  <simonstewart> The java tests have been clean for a while on my linux and mac boxes
2011-02-28T05:24:48  <nirvdrum> Oh, I forgot, dick around with the IntelliJ file :-P
2011-02-28T05:24:49  <simonstewart> Though I've not been close enough to the Windows machine to check that
2011-02-28T05:24:54  <simonstewart> Oh yeah
2011-02-28T05:24:57  <nirvdrum> Does anyone mind if I make the JDK target Java 6?
2011-02-28T05:24:57  <simonstewart> Always got to do that :)
2011-02-28T05:25:08  <simonstewart> For tests, no
2011-02-28T05:25:09  <nirvdrum> Java 5 is EOL'd, right?
2011-02-28T05:25:21  <simonstewart> Sadly lots of people haven't made the jump
2011-02-28T05:25:42  <nirvdrum> I don't mean the language features.  Just the project JDK.  Java 5 doesn't even exist for Mac OS 10.6.
2011-02-28T05:25:53  <simonstewart> OK
2011-02-28T05:25:55  <nirvdrum> So, I have to change it to Java 6 just to get anything to compile.
2011-02-28T05:26:13  <simonstewart> I've just copied my JDK6 and named it java 5
2011-02-28T05:26:15  <nirvdrum> If not, I'll just cope.3
2011-02-28T05:26:19  <nirvdrum> Heh.
2011-02-28T05:26:22  <nirvdrum> That's one option.

2011-02-28T05:27:43  * simonstewart looks in the other direction
2011-02-28T05:28:38  <nirvdrum> simonstewart: Since I have you and we're discussing uncomfortable topics, could you let me know what sorts of failures you were seeing with that googlechrome security setting change?  I've emailed you a couple times.  I'm legitimately interested.
2011-02-28T05:28:59  <simonstewart> Some of the tests here are security tests
2011-02-28T05:29:16  <simonstewart> They fail when chrome disregards its own security settings
2011-02-28T05:29:19  <AutomatedTester> tests are running to double check it
2011-02-28T05:29:22  <simonstewart> I'm working with them to make the tests robust
2011-02-28T05:29:27  <AutomatedTester> getting lunch while its running
2011-02-28T05:29:40  <simonstewart> Then we'll flip to making "disable web security" the default
2011-02-28T05:29:48  <nirvdrum> simonstewart: Ahh.  So internal Google stuff.  Makes sense.
2011-02-28T05:29:52  <simonstewart> Yeah
2011-02-28T05:30:01  <simonstewart> Which makes it Really Hard to share the tests
2011-02-28T05:30:12  <nirvdrum> Heh.
2011-02-28T05:30:13  <simonstewart> And, you know, security is something to take seriously
2011-02-28T05:30:48  <simonstewart> It's not _just_ me being a douche :)
2011-02-28T05:30:59  <nirvdrum> I was wondering if it was something to watch out for.  I'm in a weird position where I've tested 10's of thousands of unique sites and hadn't seen any problems, but the Web is a fickle environemnt.

2011-02-28T06:56:33  <ian_mac_> so I'm trying to understand the key differences between Selenium 1 and 2 in regards to the Webdriver stuff.  In Selenium 1 when you ran tests you always connected through the RC server.  This meant that you didn't need to know anything about the particular browser in your client bindings.  Am I understanding correctly that this is different now?

2011-02-28T07:12:09  <Archdude> hey
2011-02-28T07:12:20  <ovi23> hello
2011-02-28T07:12:25  <simonstewart> back
2011-02-28T07:12:30  <ovi23> can some1 help me with test for pruchase
2011-02-28T07:12:37  <ovi23> in a webshop
2011-02-28T07:12:38  <ovi23> ?
2011-02-28T07:12:51  <simonstewart> ian_mac_: you always needed to know the browser
2011-02-28T07:12:57  <simonstewart> "*firefox" for example
2011-02-28T07:13:03  <simonstewart> Now it's just a little more spelled out
2011-02-28T07:13:13  <simonstewart> FWIW, I tend to use a builder to abstract the differences away
2011-02-28T07:13:28  <ian_mac_> simonstewart - well, I know you needed to know the browser
2011-02-28T07:13:32  <ian_mac_> but if say I'm writing PHP bindings
2011-02-28T07:13:36  <ian_mac_> reading more now
2011-02-28T07:13:39  <simonstewart> Ahhh...
2011-02-28T07:13:49  <simonstewart> In that case, I'd start with the remote webdriver stuff
2011-02-28T07:13:55  <ian_mac_> all I have to do is implemnt an API that communicates using JSON wire on the backend, right?
2011-02-28T07:14:01  <simonstewart> Which means that there's a server in the way (just as in Selenium 1)
2011-02-28T07:14:03  <simonstewart> Right
2011-02-28T07:14:06  <ian_mac_> ok
2011-02-28T07:14:22  <ian_mac_> are there advantages to using local webdriver?
2011-02-28T07:14:38  <simonstewart> Once you're up and running, it means you don't need the server process
2011-02-28T07:14:44  <ian_mac_> ok
2011-02-28T07:14:46  <simonstewart> But to get started, it doesn't make much difference
2011-02-28T07:14:49  <ian_mac_> right
2011-02-28T07:14:56  <ian_mac_> so that would mean that
2011-02-28T07:15:10  <ian_mac_> I would write a bit more logic to make it local
2011-02-28T07:15:23  <ian_mac_> so that I would actually implement the server bit too, right?
2011-02-28T07:15:24  <simonstewart> Exactly
2011-02-28T07:15:28  <simonstewart> No need
2011-02-28T07:15:38  <simonstewart> Just use the one you can already download from the project site
2011-02-28T07:15:55  <ian_mac_> no but I mean to make it use local
2011-02-28T07:16:00  <simonstewart> Even then
2011-02-28T07:16:06  <simonstewart> Just start the server on the local machine
2011-02-28T07:16:11  <ian_mac_> ah ok
2011-02-28T07:16:14  <simonstewart> :)
2011-02-28T07:16:20  <ian_mac_> well, I'll cross that bridge when I get there
2011-02-28T07:16:21  <simonstewart> We try and make it easy to get started
2011-02-28T07:16:22  *** ner0x has joined #selenium
2011-02-28T07:16:24  <ian_mac_> I'll just do remote for now
2011-02-28T07:16:24  <simonstewart> :)
2011-02-28T07:16:42  <ian_mac_> so would you generally make your client API fairly transparent to the JSON wire protocol?
2011-02-28T07:17:05  <simonstewart> We make the client API hide it
2011-02-28T07:17:14  <simonstewart> So that we can flip the implementation as necessary
2011-02-28T07:17:37  *** davehunt is now known as davehunt|away
2011-02-28T07:17:52  <ian_mac_> right but what I mean is... eventually you get a driver class in your client, right?
2011-02-28T07:18:01  <simonstewart> Ahhh...
2011-02-28T07:18:07  <ian_mac_> the API of the driver class would generally resemble the wire protocol, correct?
2011-02-28T07:18:16  <simonstewart> On the client side, no matter which browser you pick the remote stuff remains the same
2011-02-28T07:18:20  <simonstewart> yes
2011-02-28T07:18:36  <ian_mac_> so I would have, for example, $driver->back();
2011-02-28T07:18:43  <simonstewart> exactly
2011-02-28T07:18:48  <ian_mac_> and that would talk to the server and send the back command
2011-02-28T07:18:50  <ian_mac_> ok
2011-02-28T07:18:51  <ian_mac_> cool
2011-02-28T07:18:53  <simonstewart> :)
2011-02-28T07:18:54  <ian_mac_> thx for your help
2011-02-28T07:19:01  <simonstewart> Take a look at the Java WebDriver interface
2011-02-28T07:19:06  <simonstewart> It's how we've modelled everything else
2011-02-28T07:19:16  <ian_mac_> ok
2011-02-28T07:19:45  <simonstewart> Need a link?
2011-02-28T07:20:05  <ian_mac_> you mean http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/client/src/com/thoughtworks/selenium/Selenium.java
2011-02-28T07:20:08  <ian_mac_> that, right?
2011-02-28T07:20:10  <ovi23> i want to know how may i create automate test for a music web shop , how can i be sure that evry time i slect diferent track

2011-02-28T07:20:49  <simonstewart> ovi23: how would a user tell the tracks apart?
2011-02-28T07:21:44  <ovi23> i dont understand ..tracks are listed in categorys for example New Releases , Most Downloaded track
2011-02-28T07:22:06  <ovi23> and the flow is click on a price button -> than confirm -> download
2011-02-28T07:22:09  *** andytinkham has joined #selenium
2011-02-28T07:22:14  <simonstewart> Right. So how would a user recognize that they've selected a different track every time?
2011-02-28T07:22:25  <ovi23> no
2011-02-28T07:22:35  <ovi23> if some1 already puchase a track
2011-02-28T07:22:57  <ovi23> after confirmation is infomed that the track was already payed and he can have it for free
2011-02-28T07:23:05  <simonstewart> ok
2011-02-28T07:23:11  <simonstewart> I'm not seeing the problem here
2011-02-28T07:23:20  <simonstewart> It sounds like you already know the answer to the question...?
2011-02-28T07:23:57  <ovi23> well for example if i put to run evry day a purchase
2011-02-28T07:24:33  <ovi23> at the next run how i automate to select another track
2011-02-28T07:24:34  <ovi23> ?
2011-02-28T07:24:54  <ovi23> that is what i dont know
2011-02-28T07:24:55  <ovi23> :d
2011-02-28T07:25:13  <simonstewart> Store the name of the track you've downloaded somewhere
2011-02-28T07:25:22  <simonstewart> And just do a look up before selecting a new track
2011-02-28T07:25:40  <ovi23> great
2011-02-28T07:25:41  <ovi23> thank you

2011-02-28T11:29:07  <Rich_Morin> I'd like to use the Selenium RubyGem to automate some web interactions.  Unfortunately, the only examples I've found assume that I'm working within a test framework. Help?
2011-02-28T11:31:49  <Rich_Morin> looks like http://selenium-client.rubyforge.org/ has what I need

2011-02-28T11:49:01  <nirvdrum> Rich_Morin: Just use the library to do whatever you want.
2011-02-28T11:49:07  <nirvdrum> All a test does is form a context for code execution.
2011-02-28T11:51:12  <Rich_Morin> nirvdrum: Just so, and an example should provide the information on how to set up a minimal context.
2011-02-28T11:51:33  <nirvdrum> Generally that's what a test is.
2011-02-28T11:52:03  <Rich_Morin> nirvdrum: No, a test sits within a context provided by a test framework.
2011-02-28T11:52:36  <Rich_Morin> nirvdrum: So, for example, it may set up magic variables, import gems, etc.
2011-02-28T11:52:40  <nirvdrum> It quite literally shows you how to setup your connection, tear it down, and run specific tasks.

2011-02-28T12:43:36  <jarib> hi plightbo
2011-02-28T12:44:16  <plightbo> we're seeing a situation where WebDriver is _really_ slow clicking an element. It's clearly visible, but it seems to take 8+ seconds to find it and make the click
2011-02-28T12:44:21  <jarib> adamgoucher: this would be good to communicate somehow as well - https://gist.github.com/847999 - either on the wiki or as a blog post
2011-02-28T12:44:30  <plightbo> in 1.x it's super fast because it's not doing all the fancy scrolling and whatnot
2011-02-28T12:44:35  <jarib> plightbo: what browser?
2011-02-28T12:44:39  <plightbo> firefox 3.6

2011-02-28T13:10:56  <jarib> Rich_Morin: if it's in a non-standard location, you either need to do what you're doing or add those locations to PATH

2011-02-28T13:12:18  <jarib> oh, for chrome, we don't search PATH on OS X

2011-02-28T13:17:52  <Rich_Morin>  Firefox::Binary.path= or Chrome::Launcher.path=, for example - though the method you suggest gets around that.  Also, using PATH, except when it doesn't
2011-02-28T13:18:55  <jarib> Firefox::Binary and Chrome::Launcher are both private

2011-02-28T13:24:55  <Rich_Morin> Unfortunately, I can't find an OSX command (eg, an open(1) option) to find out the path to an app.  However, LaunchServices may be able to provide that information.  Would you be interested in having a way to do that, if I find one?
2011-02-28T13:25:29  <jarib> absolutely
2011-02-28T13:26:17  <Rich_Morin> no promises, but I'll see what I can find.
2011-02-28T13:43:47  <Rich_Morin> jarib: open(1) can find and open an app - might you be able to use it to start up the browser?

2011-02-28T13:47:09  <antlong> Rich_Morin, os-x doesnt work like ubuntu or such. there is no symlink for firefox to use which, or such with
2011-02-28T13:47:48  <Rich_Morin> antlong: understood, but the code could use a different technique, based on the OS type.
2011-02-28T13:48:39  *** Putr has joined #selenium
2011-02-28T13:48:39  <antlong> there is no automated method to look for it, minus checking in /applications/, unless the user makes a symlink, or has a locate database built.
2011-02-28T13:53:20  <Rich_Morin> antlong: First, there ARE ways to find the path, else open(1) would not be able to launch apps. Also, AppleScript might be able to get the info (eg, tell application "Finder" to return the (posix path of (path to application "VLC" as alias)) or somesuch.
2011-02-28T13:53:41  *** Putr has quit IRC
2011-02-28T13:53:49  <Rich_Morin> antlong: Second, if Selenium used open(1) to launch the app, it wouldn't need to know the path.
2011-02-28T13:54:16  <antlong> Rich_Morin, thats not at all how it works
2011-02-28T13:55:04  <antlong> Rich_Morin, sure theres ways to find a path, but the path doesnt exist by default, if someone put the path in their environment you can find it, but like i said, there is no automated way to do this, since the path isnt set automatically.
2011-02-28T13:56:45  <antlong> it works on ubuntu, because the firefox installation places a symlink in /usr/bin, and $PATH has /usr/bin set by default.

2011-02-28T14:05:06  <antlong> well it does, but like i said, the firefox installation doesnt make a symlink
2011-02-28T14:05:29  <antlong> and since you can drop Firefox.app anywhere you want, there is a bit more work required to find where it is
2011-02-28T14:05:50  <ian_mac_> right, so you'd have to search the whole file system, which has it's problems
2011-02-28T14:06:05  <antlong> well, the main problem would be, if you have multiple firefox's, which do we use?
2011-02-28T14:06:18  <ian_mac_> whichever one you find first :)
2011-02-28T14:06:27  <antlong> that could wind up being firefox 2.0
2011-02-28T14:06:41  <ian_mac_> (obviously you'd make it possible to override the found one)
2011-02-28T14:06:43  <jarib> Rich_Morin: i need to able to shut it down, see if it crashes, see the process output for debugging etc, open() won't give me that
2011-02-28T14:06:53  <ian_mac_> anyway
2011-02-28T14:06:55  <ian_mac_> *shrug*
2011-02-28T14:06:58  <antlong> the smartest thing to do, is have the person enter a path, then save the path they entered in a config for next time
2011-02-28T14:07:09  <Rich_Morin> OK, but I might be able to get you the path via AppleScript or OSA
