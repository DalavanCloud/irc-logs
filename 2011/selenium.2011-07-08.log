2011-07-08T00:04:28  *** barancev has quit IRC
2011-07-08T00:04:54  <barancev|2> what language binding do you use?
2011-07-08T00:05:50  <odix> python
2011-07-08T00:06:41  <odix> i have sel.select("..SSR_EXACT_MATCH1") and sel.value("C") but no bueno
2011-07-08T00:09:58  <barancev|2> you seems to use API 1.0, sorry, I can't help
2011-07-08T00:10:22  <barancev|2> with API 2.0 (WebDriver) you may look at this samples: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py/test/selenium/webdriver/common/select_element_handling_tests.py
2011-07-08T00:11:55  <odix> i have 2.0
2011-07-08T00:14:14  <barancev|2> 2.0 includes two APIs: 1.0 -- from selenium import selenium AND 2.0 -- from selenium import webdriver
2011-07-08T00:16:18  <barancev|2> I bet you are using 1.0
2011-07-08T00:17:06  <barancev|2> try sel.select("CLASS_SRCH_WRK2_SSR_EXACT_MATCH1", "value=C")
2011-07-08T00:21:42  <odix> ahh
2011-07-08T00:21:44  <odix> i was close
2011-07-08T00:21:50  <odix> had value="c"
2011-07-08T00:23:25  <odix> ill look at 2.0
2011-07-08T00:23:31  <freynaud> good morning
2011-07-08T00:25:18  <barancev|2> odix: the piece of code before uses API 1.0, with 2.0 you have to do click on options, there is no select procedure in API 2.0
2011-07-08T00:27:40  *** sdimkov has joined #selenium
2011-07-08T00:28:01  <barancev|2> gog, it is so hard to explain that 2.0 includes two different APIs. my clients all say "yes, we are using 2.0, we have already updraded" - but - NO! they are using API 1.0
2011-07-08T00:29:40  <barancev|2> I think answering this question will be my main job for a month or two :)
2011-07-08T00:30:14  <barancev|2> until I really move them to API 2.0

2011-07-08T01:22:05  <jarib> barancev|2: probably not so useful to describe it as the 1.0 API vs the 2.0 API
2011-07-08T01:22:42  <jarib> barancev|2: e.g. rather use Selenium RC vs WebDriver
2011-07-08T01:23:20  <jarib> though "Selenium RC" isn't a great name either, given that WebDriver does have a remote server component
2011-07-08T01:23:39  <jarib> oh well.
2011-07-08T01:26:12  <barancev|2> yes, it is not easy to explain :)
2011-07-08T01:29:17  <barancev|2> and API 1.0 backed with WebDriver adds some confusing too

2011-07-08T03:59:48  <Mayank> Hi, I have used both explicit wait and driver.findelement by id, XPATH, css, but nothing seems working in detecting an element already present in the DOM. This element is not clickable, but after an AJAX code is executed the element becomes clickable, nevertheless the element should be detected as it is already there in the DOM. What could be blocking? What are the other ways i can detect an element?
2011-07-08T04:00:21  <simonstewart> Mayank: is this the code that I looked at the other day?

2011-07-08T04:04:38  <freynaud> you should be able to force it
2011-07-08T04:05:00  <davehunt> I can, and I'm doing that by specifying it in the .json file
2011-07-08T04:05:05  <freynaud> -host XYZ to force the node to launch with host = XYZ

2011-07-08T04:50:12  <nirvdrum> AutomatedTester: One of them.  This is purely for the Web view.
2011-07-08T04:50:28  <AutomatedTester> Francois showed it to me yesterday
2011-07-08T04:50:31  <AutomatedTester> its awesome
2011-07-08T04:51:02  <nirvdrum> It's actually really simple.  There's a base servlet class you can inherit from that gives you access to the hub registry.  You just make sure your subclass is on the classpath and pass the name on the command-line.  The hub then just maps it to a context in Jetty.
2011-07-08T04:51:11  <nirvdrum> Really simple, but a great way to bolt onto the hub.
2011-07-08T04:52:02  <nirvdrum> So I have one servlet that displays the Mogotest cluster in a more sensible way for me.  And I have another one that basically serves up a JSON representation in a way that I need.

2011-07-08T05:49:13  * adamgoucher is downloading the freakiin' internet -- erm, clean checkout
2011-07-08T05:49:57  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: when you check it out, do a build
2011-07-08T05:50:43  <nirvdrum> The build is quite slownow.
2011-07-08T05:51:13  <AutomatedTester> nirvdrum: is that on top of download the internets for that too
2011-07-08T05:51:15  <AutomatedTester> ?
2011-07-08T05:51:30  <nirvdrum> Yeah.  The atoms compilation is really slow now.
2011-07-08T05:51:42  <nirvdrum> Something that changed in the last week and a half.
2011-07-08T05:52:04  <ato> adamgoucher: Have you tried using git-svn? d-: That's even slower.
2011-07-08T05:52:07  <nirvdrum> I don't mind the svn up, other than GoogleCode erroring out most of the time.
2011-07-08T05:52:29  <adamgoucher> well. 2.0 is marketing release; now comes the make it work and/or make it fast releases :)
2011-07-08T05:52:35  <nirvdrum> ato: I started just using http://github.com/Selenium2/Selenium2.  I highly recommend that over your own git-svn fork.
2011-07-08T05:54:00  <ato> That's awesome!
2011-07-08T05:54:08  <ato> Who keeps it updated?
2011-07-08T05:54:14  <nirvdrum> It lags by about an hour, but much simpler.

2011-07-08T07:24:15  <simonstewart> The version number in the second para was on purpose, as I'm actually refering to the downloads that people are using
2011-07-08T07:26:13  <adamgoucher> should you mention that this is the api stability release and not the works perfectly one? and/or your proposed release schedule for the next couple months?
2011-07-08T07:26:33  <simonstewart> Good point.
2011-07-08T07:27:30  <simonstewart> I think a follow up post may be called for
2011-07-08T07:28:03  <adamgoucher> it kinda implies right now that it is the works perfectly release
2011-07-08T07:28:24  <simonstewart> It _is_ a .0 release
2011-07-08T07:28:27  <simonstewart> but I get the point.

2011-07-08T07:32:17  <simonstewart> We really need Apple's help to make the Safari driver a reality
2011-07-08T07:32:58  <QAguy> Yea not having it for 2.0 is a pain as we have a lot of client that use our software on Apple/Safari machines
2011-07-08T07:33:12  <simonstewart> The iphone driver is pretty good
2011-07-08T07:33:20  <QAguy> that is true

2011-07-08T09:27:28  <antlong> yeah but that could be from the python bindings malforming some request or such

2011-07-08T14:02:35  <autojack> is there an easy way I can maximize a browser window via WebDriver? I'm using the Ruby bindings. I used to do this by calling getEval, but I'm not sure if that's available via Ruby.
2011-07-08T14:04:29  <autojack> oh, I see execute_script. maybe that'll work.

2011-07-08T14:11:14  *** Mayank has joined #selenium
2011-07-08T14:11:58  <autojack> yeah I know the js I need to run. I just wasn't sure how to run it via Selenium.
2011-07-08T14:19:38  <autojack> I have a search form that I'm trying to fill out and submit with Selenium, and it intermittently fails to submit. nothing happens when I send an 'enter' keystroke. I think this is a common problem... I need to wait for something before trying to submit, but I don't know what.
2011-07-08T14:19:56  <autojack> maybe I need to 'focus' it?
2011-07-08T14:23:18  <antlong> focus on the input field maybe, or use send_keys
2011-07-08T14:26:36  <autojack> I am using send_keys
2011-07-08T14:27:42  <autojack> I can't figure out how to call focus(), because it's part of the GeneratedDriver class and I've never understood if, or how, I can access that from the ruby bindings. see http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/Client/GeneratedDriver.html#focus-instance_method
2011-07-08T14:29:32  <jarib> autojack: the whole Selenium::Client namespace is Selenium RC. if you're using WebDriver that's not something you can use
2011-07-08T14:29:38  <jarib> send_keys should auto-focus the element in question
2011-07-08T14:29:42  *** adamgoucher has joined #selenium
2011-07-08T14:30:25  <jarib> firefox is picky about the browser being the frontmost window in order to fire focus/blur events though, perhaps that's why you're having trouble
2011-07-08T14:30:28  <autojack> jarib: ok that's what I thought from reading the API doc. that was my impression.
2011-07-08T14:30:42  <autojack> jarib: oh! that might explain it!
2011-07-08T14:31:54  <autojack> hm. that might be it jarib.
2011-07-08T14:32:03  <autojack> I just ran the test twice, once with the browser in front and once with it behind.
2011-07-08T14:32:16  <autojack> there's no workaround for that is there :/
2011-07-08T14:32:30  <autojack> because you can't use js to make the browser the top window
2011-07-08T14:32:31  <jarib> unfortunately not

2011-07-08T14:32:32  <autojack> iirc
2011-07-08T14:32:36  <autojack> that bites.
2011-07-08T14:32:58  <jarib> you can use a VM, or a separate X display if you're on linux
2011-07-08T14:33:06  <antlong> use watch
2011-07-08T14:33:12  <antlong> if youre on linux
2011-07-08T14:33:27  <jarib> actually on linux, we provide a way to work around it
2011-07-08T14:33:36  <jarib> loading the no-focus lib
2011-07-08T14:34:14  *** xirkus has joined #selenium
2011-07-08T14:34:21  <jarib> autojack: what platform are you on?
2011-07-08T14:41:14  <autojack> I'm on Mac for developing the tests, Linux for running them.
2011-07-08T14:41:23  *** Mayank1 has joined #selenium
2011-07-08T14:41:27  <autojack> on Linux I think I don't have any problem, because I use xvfb
2011-07-08T14:41:36  <autojack> so FF is the only window in that case
2011-07-08T14:41:42  <jarib> yeah, that's the way to go
2011-07-08T14:41:48  <autojack> so on Mac I just have to make sure I foreground the window when I run the script.
2011-07-08T14:42:20  <antlong> brew install watch
2011-07-08T14:42:35  *** Mayank1 has quit IRC
2011-07-08T14:42:51  <jarib> antlong: what does watch do?
2011-07-08T14:43:08  *** Mayank1 has joined #selenium
2011-07-08T14:43:12  <jarib> if it's the regular linux watch, i'm not sure how that will help
2011-07-08T14:43:34  <antlong> you can use watch to force the window to be in focus
2011-07-08T14:44:15  <autojack> interesting.
2011-07-08T14:44:20  *** Mayank has quit IRC
2011-07-08T14:44:24  <antlong> you use watch to run wmctrl on a cron
2011-07-08T14:45:01  <jarib> that sounds annoying if it's the machine you're using to develop tests
2011-07-08T14:45:13  <autojack> haha
2011-07-08T14:45:20  <antlong> you only need to run it in a subprocess before you start your test session
2011-07-08T14:45:32  <autojack> none of this means anything to me :)
2011-07-08T14:45:39  <autojack> watch, wmctrl... why would I use this stuff with cron?
2011-07-08T14:45:42  <antlong> once the test session is finished, it will not do anything
2011-07-08T14:46:00  <antlong> autojack: to force the window to stay focused, should you lose focus at some point for w/e reason
2011-07-08T14:46:07  <autojack> is this on Mac?
2011-07-08T14:46:18  <autojack> bc I don't have wmctrl on mine.
2011-07-08T14:46:20  <antlong> yeah, its not standard
2011-07-08T14:47:08  <antlong> http://code.activestate.com/pypm/wmctrl/
2011-07-08T14:47:12  <antlong> should be something similar in ruby

2011-07-08T14:51:05  <autojack> I'm not running Firefox in X on Mac.
2011-07-08T14:56:51  <jarib> yeah, i don't think that advice makes a lot of sense

2011-07-08T14:58:00  <autojack> me either.
2011-07-08T14:58:10  <autojack> it got me wondering if I could use AppleScript to focus something though.
2011-07-08T14:59:54  <jarib> you probably can
2011-07-08T15:00:52  <jarib> osascript -e 'tell application "Firefox" to activate'
2011-07-08T15:01:22  <autojack> yeah I'm reading something along those lines.
