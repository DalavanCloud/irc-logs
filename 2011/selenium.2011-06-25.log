2011-06-25T07:00:19  <AutomatedTester> jarib: when you updated the closure compiler, did you just do the jar?
2011-06-25T07:00:49  <AutomatedTester> and to revert, do you know if I need to do anything to the build file?
2011-06-25T07:01:04  *** sylvinus has quit IRC
2011-06-25T07:01:25  <jarib> i updated both the compiler and the library
2011-06-25T07:01:41  <AutomatedTester> for our build, do I need to revert it all ?
2011-06-25T07:02:07  <AutomatedTester> i *think* the latest version is causing a perf issue but want to test my theory
2011-06-25T07:02:19  *** Mayank has quit IRC
2011-06-25T07:02:34  <jarib> i think we refer to the jar path (which includes the version number) + we now pass an option to the compiler that wasn't available in the older version
2011-06-25T07:02:38  <jarib> which is why we updated

2011-06-25T07:03:29  <AutomatedTester> B3 isnt really showing the issue and RC3 i
2011-06-25T07:04:14  <jarib> i see
2011-06-25T07:04:32  <AutomatedTester> the JS hasnt changed so now trying to see if its closure
2011-06-25T07:04:45  <AutomatedTester> I know I am grasping at straws but want to go down all avenues
2011-06-25T07:06:58  <jarib> you'll probably have to revert at least r12203 and r12206

2011-06-25T07:08:00  <AutomatedTester> awesome
2011-06-25T07:08:38  <jarib> perhaps easier to check out the revision before the closure update to confirm that is ok first
2011-06-25T07:09:11  <AutomatedTester> thats what I am doing now
2011-06-25T07:09:47  <jarib> also r12206 is pretty important; without it we're not compatible with e.g. prototype.js

2011-06-25T07:10:22  <AutomatedTester> ok
2011-06-25T07:10:43  <AutomatedTester> the differences in performance is amazing between the versions
2011-06-25T07:11:08  <AutomatedTester> going to shower while I checkout b3
2011-06-25T07:22:09  <jarib> turning off the native array prototypes will probably have some performance impact, but i don't think it should be massive
2011-06-25T07:22:16  <jarib> and it definitely shouldn't get worse over time
2011-06-25T07:22:43  <jarib> of course, may be some other issue in closure
2011-06-25T07:24:14  *** nirvdrum has joined #selenium
2011-06-25T07:24:28  <jarib> would be easy to check if it's the native array thing by just removing the compiler flag (rake-tasks/crazy_fun/mappings/javascript.rb:306)

2011-06-25T07:43:53  <jarib> not sure
2011-06-25T07:44:07  <jarib> i think you can use the old compiler with the new lib
2011-06-25T07:44:30  <jarib> but the perf bug could be in the library as well
2011-06-25T07:44:44  <AutomatedTester> well, I will update the compiler and see
2011-06-25T07:44:45  <AutomatedTester> \

2011-06-25T21:26:48  <AutomatedTester> but good email
2011-06-25T21:26:57  <nirvdrum> There have been a few people I've wanted to strangle this week :-P

2011-06-25T21:27:30  <nirvdrum> It's coming from the other side, too.  There's no need for Tarun to tell people to fuck off 15 different times.

2011-06-25T21:28:42  <nirvdrum> It took me several drafts to address this comment: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1854#c25
2011-06-25T21:29:04  <nirvdrum> The level of self-entitlement there was astonishing.
2011-06-25T21:29:38  <AutomatedTester> I have noticed lately the community is becoming very demanding yet will not do anything to help the project
2011-06-25T21:29:56  <AutomatedTester> for something they get for free it really gets me
2011-06-25T21:30:30  <nirvdrum> It's really hard to get involved.  Harder than most projects.  That's fine, I expect it.  But don't be a dick on the issue tracker.  Try debugging and give some real info.
2011-06-25T21:31:13  <AutomatedTester> its really hard to get involved be no other project is doing the complex things we do
2011-06-25T21:31:22  <nirvdrum> Exactly.
2011-06-25T21:31:51  <nirvdrum> And there are a lot of different languages involved, nuanced skillsets, etc.
2011-06-25T21:34:12  <nirvdrum> Anyway, I'm not looking for people to praise us or anything, I just don't want to be shit on when something doesn't work in some environment I've never tested in.
2011-06-25T21:36:04  <AutomatedTester> I am the same
2011-06-25T21:36:44  <AutomatedTester> I am getting a little annoyed with the way people have had a go at Jim who is done a brilliant job
2011-06-25T21:38:15  <nirvdrum> Agreed.  And he's doing so without the help of MS.  It's the only driver we supply that doesn't have inside help.
2011-06-25T21:41:00  <nirvdrum> Anyway, that's for the vote of affirmation.  It's hard to be diplomatic when aggravated.
2011-06-25T21:45:48  <davehunt> +1 :)
2011-06-25T21:51:03  <AutomatedTester> i updated #1854 with my basic search for the perf issue
2011-06-25T21:51:03  <selbot2>  open/new Selenium 2.0 RC2 gets constantly slower during test suite - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1854
2011-06-25T21:52:26  <nirvdrum> Thanks.  I'm not sure how much of a help I'll be if this turns out to be an atoms issue.
2011-06-25T21:52:32  <nirvdrum> I CC'd Jason and Simon.
2011-06-25T21:53:07  <AutomatedTester> i havent touched atoms but I should learn about them
2011-06-25T21:54:16  <nirvdrum> Likewise.

2011-06-25T22:11:23  <baijum> AutomatedTester: I have slightly modified the path in #1651 to use separate README file for long_description (this will be visible in PyPI)
2011-06-25T22:11:25  <selbot2>  open/accepted Generating documentation with Sphinx produces warnings, docstrings need overhaul. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1651
2011-06-25T22:11:39  <baijum> please see my comment
2011-06-25T22:12:15  <AutomatedTester> thanks
2011-06-25T22:12:40  <baijum> np :)
2011-06-25T22:15:35  <baijum> AutomatedTester: Where you are planning to host the API, there are two good locations: http://readthedocs.org/ (Used by many Python projects) and this one: http://packages.python.org/
2011-06-25T22:16:06  <AutomatedTester> baijum: I was thinking of packages.python.org
2011-06-25T22:16:37  <baijum> ah. ok
2011-06-25T22:17:15  <AutomatedTester> baijum: which would you prefer?
2011-06-25T22:17:16  <baijum> There should be some narrative documentation also, which includes a short tutorial and small HOWTOs
2011-06-25T22:17:34  <baijum> AutomatedTester: I am fine with packages.python.org
2011-06-25T22:17:42  <AutomatedTester> baijum: the Seleniumhq site will have the how tos
2011-06-25T22:17:52  <baijum> ok
2011-06-25T22:18:34  <baijum> is that text in different svn path ?
2011-06-25T22:19:03  * baijum checking...
2011-06-25T22:19:03  <AutomatedTester> yea, its in a directory above trunk in SVN
2011-06-25T22:20:11  <baijum> AutomatedTester: this location is meant to write Python related things also ? http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/websites/www.seleniumhq.org/src/main/rst
2011-06-25T22:20:45  <AutomatedTester> i am not sure which folder is supposed to have what
2011-06-25T22:20:56  <AutomatedTester> the documentation team knows better than me
2011-06-25T22:22:26  <baijum> ah. ok
