2011-08-20T04:51:10  <jarib> krosenvold: hi
2011-08-20T04:51:16  <krosenvold> jarib: Hi!
2011-08-20T04:51:28  <krosenvold> Stay up late ?
2011-08-20T04:51:37  <jarib> nope
2011-08-20T04:51:46  <jarib> we left shortly after you
2011-08-20T04:52:06  <krosenvold> Right, the table was only until 19 ish or so
2011-08-20T04:52:17  <jarib> aye
2011-08-20T04:52:41  <jarib> so, re ~/.crazyfun
2011-08-20T04:52:46  <jarib> i considered using the full path
2011-08-20T04:52:48  <krosenvold> Ahem, yes.
2011-08-20T04:52:50  <jarib> s/path/url
2011-08-20T04:52:59  <krosenvold> Yup. I might have changed my mind ;)
2011-08-20T04:53:01  <jarib> but didn't think it was necessary since the file names are unique
2011-08-20T04:53:22  <krosenvold> Not for different versions, but then tha md5 is incorrect
2011-08-20T04:53:23  <krosenvold> So its ok
2011-08-20T04:53:47  <krosenvold> If you included url you could actually re-build old versions too ;)
2011-08-20T04:53:48  <jarib> oh, but then it will be overwritten, no?
2011-08-20T04:54:07  <jarib> i'll just fix it
2011-08-20T04:54:17  <krosenvold> I assume you discard local cached version if md5 is incorrect
2011-08-20T04:54:28  <krosenvold> Cool
2011-08-20T04:54:37  <krosenvold> Then we can even rebuild old versions ;)
2011-08-20T04:54:48  <krosenvold> mr jari "crazy fun" bakken ;)
2011-08-20T04:54:51  <krosenvold> Is on the case
2011-08-20T04:54:59  <jarib> if the md5 is incorrect, we'll re-download (assuming a failed download or similar)
2011-08-20T04:55:02  <jarib> haha
2011-08-20T04:55:04  <krosenvold> Just because he knows ruby ;)
2011-08-20T04:55:16  <jarib> yep :)
2011-08-20T04:55:22  <krosenvold> I never admit to knowing VB
2011-08-20T04:55:33  <krosenvold> Or, having known it. As well as excel macros
2011-08-20T04:55:55  <jarib> good choice
2011-08-20T04:56:25  <jarib> i think me faking not knowing ruby would make my contribution to this project rather difficult
2011-08-20T04:56:44  <krosenvold> You could pretend not to understand rake, perhaps
2011-08-20T04:56:48  <krosenvold> But too late for that
2011-08-20T04:58:37  <jarib> indeed

2011-08-20T05:01:27  <krosenvold> Thank you jari "crazy fun" bakken
2011-08-20T05:02:18  <krosenvold> I think I'll make a t-shirt that say's "I'm qualified to new Thread()"
2011-08-20T05:03:01  <krosenvold> BUt ruby only has one thread, right ?
2011-08-20T05:03:26  <krosenvold> Which all of you ruby devs share, I presume ;)
2011-08-20T05:04:10  *** nitin has joined #selenium
2011-08-20T05:04:59  <jarib> ruby has threads, but they're not really concurrent because of the GIL
2011-08-20T05:06:07  <jarib> except on jruby where they're just like java threads
2011-08-20T05:08:16  <krosenvold> how big is jruby in the ruby community ?
2011-08-20T05:09:31  *** nitin has quit IRC
2011-08-20T05:09:36  <jarib> i don't have any real numbers, but i think it's doing pretty well
2011-08-20T05:10:15  *** nitin has joined #selenium
2011-08-20T05:10:32  <jarib> they're doing pretty well performance-wise among the ruby implementations
2011-08-20T05:11:40  <jarib> there's quite a bit of cultural opposition to anything Java-related though
2011-08-20T05:12:34  <krosenvold> who would've guessed
2011-08-20T05:13:01  <jarib> and the JVM startup time makes jruby really slow for short scripts
2011-08-20T05:15:54  <jarib> it's going to be interesting to see how invokedynamic in java 7 affects jruby performance
2011-08-20T05:16:46  <jarib> seems like the hotspot devs are working quite closely with the jruby guys to make it work well
2011-08-20T05:16:49  <krosenvold> and the load time should be much better
2011-08-20T05:17:17  <ato> If they can improve load time, JRuby will be much more usable.
2011-08-20T05:17:33  <ato> They also seem to have resolved most of the RubyGems compatibility issues they used to have in lower versions.
2011-08-20T05:18:24  <krosenvold> they fixed deps in basic class libraries so lots fewer need to be loaded
2011-08-20T05:19:17  <ato> Aha
2011-08-20T05:20:06  <jarib> ato: the maven-rubygems integration looks pretty nice, e.g. you can just do `gem install mvn:<some artifact>` now
2011-08-20T05:21:12  <ato> I've never really use Maven, but that sounds magical.
2011-08-20T05:22:14  <krosenvold> so you can download the internet from ruby too, now ? /snigger

2011-08-20T13:06:03  <mydog2> hey Ajay  - my bad!!
2011-08-20T13:06:15  <mydog2> i thought i did crazy hrs..
2011-08-20T13:08:59  <mydog2> i've been getting errs.. org.openqa.selenium.StaleElementReferenceException: Element not found in the cache <<
2011-08-20T13:10:06  <Ajay> You get a staleElement
2011-08-20T13:10:26  <mydog2> i got the errs initially when i had a loop through different elements in a page, that then clicked on the hrefs from the links..
2011-08-20T13:11:06  <mydog2> i decided to try to run a bunch of java apps sequentially to do the same thing as the loop to see if the err msgs resolved..
2011-08-20T13:11:06  <Ajay> exception ehrn the element is not in page , i.e u r referencing something which is not present now
2011-08-20T13:11:18  <mydog2> apparently..
2011-08-20T13:12:03  <mydog2> but when i run a separate java process to get the data from a given page... there shouldn't be an err...
2011-08-20T13:12:26  <mydog2> but is there a way to check/trap/resolve the err?
2011-08-20T13:12:32  <Ajay> can u gist the entire code
2011-08-20T13:13:00  <mydog2> i can..
2011-08-20T13:13:03  <Ajay> i can explain y u might be getting an exception
2011-08-20T13:13:13  <Ajay> lets assume u have page 1 and page 2
2011-08-20T13:13:27  <Ajay> u referenced an id in page1 and moved on to page 2
2011-08-20T13:13:29  <mydog2> let me redo some things.. get some sleep.. i'll post/paste it and ping you
2011-08-20T13:14:14  <Ajay> and trying to get some of the properties of  element of page1 in page2
2011-08-20T13:14:38  <mydog2> right now i have a py app calling the java app to do the actual page fetch.. i want to put everything back into the single java app..
2011-08-20T13:14:59  <mydog2> right...what you said makes sense..
2011-08-20T13:15:21  <mydog2> or rather.. i am going from page 1 to page 2..
