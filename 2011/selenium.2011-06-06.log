2011-06-06T02:09:20  <AutomatedTester> kondal: have you tried starting the server yourself and then trying that URL?
2011-06-06T02:11:46  <kondal> AutomatedTester : Actually we checkout  code from http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch/p#OAMlx_jo-ck/src/chrome/test/webdriver/automation.cc&exact_package=chromium  and compiled to arm toolchain and generated chrome driver executable
2011-06-06T02:12:44  <AutomatedTester> well it looks like either the server isnt running, the port is blocked or something like that
2011-06-06T02:15:26  <kondal> AutomatedTester: We started server manually (standalone server) and ran webdriver test , it throws exception . But selenium RC case is working at the same time with same server and port .
2011-06-06T02:16:12  <AutomatedTester> maybe there is something when builiding for ARM

2011-06-06T05:11:49  <jimevans> ok
2011-06-06T05:11:58  <barancev> and you suggested to install all security patches to VS
2011-06-06T05:12:04  <jimevans> yes
2011-06-06T05:12:12  <jimevans> as well as SP1

2011-06-06T05:12:47  <cheezy> when I perform a find_element using the id of the frame I get the error
2011-06-06T05:13:00  <barancev> jimevans: it does appear, but actually, The Feature Pack is required

2011-06-06T05:13:44  <barancev> and The Feature Pack can't be installed with Windows Update, yes
2011-06-06T05:13:56  <jimevans> barancev: I've never installed the Feature Pack. ever.
2011-06-06T05:15:25  <barancev> jimevans: may be your Ã€ distribution includes it, but unordered_map, spart pointers etc are implemented in this pack, not in security updates, I've checked them carefully
2011-06-06T05:15:35  <jimevans> in fact, Visual Studio 2008 SP1 includes the Feature Pack (c.f. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2008/08/11/visual-studio-2008-service-pack-1-rtm-now-available.aspx)
2011-06-06T05:17:13  <barancev> jimevans: yes, that's possible, but not those patches
2011-06-06T05:18:06  <jimevans> barancev: I'm quite sure I'm right on this one. I've set up a number of machines from clean operating systems to know what's required to compile the project.
2011-06-06T05:18:58  <jimevans> the TR1 features for Visual C++ were first introduced with the Feature Pack you mentioned, true.
2011-06-06T05:19:10  <jimevans> But the Feature Pack was rolled up into Service Pack 1.
2011-06-06T05:19:47  <jimevans> Thus, if you install Visual Studio 2008 RTM, then apply Service Pack 1, then apply the required security updates, you will be able to build the native code of the Selenium project.
2011-06-06T05:20:57  <barancev> and KB973675 is for smart devices, I've been suggested by WinUpdate to install KB973674 instead, and that works
2011-06-06T05:21:08  <jimevans> Incidentally, I've never seen Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1 show up as an update in Windows Update; I've always needed to browse for it and install it manually.
2011-06-06T05:21:52  <jimevans> barancev: okay, whatever update is required. there's a bug that the SP1 installer sometimes doesn't properly update the ATL header files, so the "
2011-06-06T05:21:59  <jimevans> "security update" is required.

2011-06-06T05:22:24  <barancev> agree, yet I've installed SP1 from MSDN library, and it seems to miss The Feature Pack, I've downloaded and installed it separately to be able to compile selenium
2011-06-06T05:23:31  <barancev> just FYI, may be some other VS SP1 distributions miss The Feature Pack too

2011-06-06T05:50:01  <jimevans> heh. that's a reasonable request. however, this isn't ie-specific; it's java-specific. .net and ruby have no issues launching multiple IE instances.
2011-06-06T05:50:28  <jimevans> (dunno about python. i'm sure AutomatedTester will set me straight)
2011-06-06T05:50:44  <freynaud> i tried with java. No issues launching, but it explodes pretty fast ^^
2011-06-06T05:51:36  <jimevans> i'm sure there are likely issues there, but i need something more concrete to reproduce.
2011-06-06T05:52:15  <freynaud> my guess is it's not implemented yet at all
2011-06-06T05:52:25  <jimevans> and cutting remote/grid out of the loop for reproduction is probably a good idea too.
2011-06-06T05:52:30  <freynaud> 2 IE on 2 drivers and IEA was signin out B

2011-06-06T05:53:17  <jimevans> oh, so we're talking about session merging then.
2011-06-06T05:54:08  <freynaud> no on purpose, I tried to swap firefox driver to IE just to see what happens

2011-06-06T05:56:32  <freynaud> i think it's just no implemented yet ( the multi IE same machine )
2011-06-06T05:57:18  <jarib> freynaud: not implemnted *for java* yet
2011-06-06T05:57:28  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: you have to manage the native-code dll loading in the language binding.
2011-06-06T05:58:21  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: like http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/ie/webdriver.py#36?
2011-06-06T05:58:41  <adamgoucher> you know, when drivers get released, part of that process should be to update the download page *cough* AutomatedTester jimevans jarib *cough*
2011-06-06T05:59:05  <jarib> AutomatedTester: you only want a single IE server instance per python process
2011-06-06T05:59:35  <jarib> AutomatedTester: so in quit(), you'll check the session count and only shut down the server if this is the the last one
2011-06-06T05:59:44  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: jarib's right on. check out InternetExplorerDriverServer.cs for more info
2011-06-06T05:59:46  <jarib> the DLL exposes a function to check that

2011-06-06T06:01:25  <lisak> if PageObjects are more of a pieces of functionality, their  load() method should be empty right ?
2011-06-06T06:01:27  <jimevans> i update the googlecode download page for .net, that's not enough? :)

2011-06-06T06:17:01  <AutomatedTester> jarib, jimevans so all I need to keep track of instances and stop the server if I am down to 0?
2011-06-06T06:17:11  <jarib> lisak: the load() method is meant to get you to the point where that LoadableComponent is ready to use
2011-06-06T06:17:25  *** gmckinlay has joined #selenium
2011-06-06T06:17:27  <jarib> lisak: so it may call parent.get() (which again calls parent.get() etc)
2011-06-06T06:17:35  <jarib> AutomatedTester: there's only one instance
2011-06-06T06:17:42  <lisak> jarib, http://pastie.org/2027287
2011-06-06T06:17:43  <jarib> well, of the server
2011-06-06T06:18:05  <lisak> in case that the page object is just a piece of functionality rather then a "webpage"
2011-06-06T06:18:21  <lisak> than*
2011-06-06T06:18:28  <jarib> AutomatedTester: you don't really need to track anything, just don't shut down the server in quit() unless GetSessionCount == 0
2011-06-06T06:19:23  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: oh good, now 2 people want support
2011-06-06T06:19:36  <jarib> lisak: that's fine - if you have things in parent.isLoaded() that checks for the presence of this component, you may want to move that to this class though
2011-06-06T06:19:42  <jarib> lisak: e.g. for nicer error messages
2011-06-06T06:20:52  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: heh. 2 is more than i expected
2011-06-06T06:21:07  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: they are still not getting support
2011-06-06T06:21:37  <adamgoucher> 2.5 and 2.6 should be non-supported as well...
2011-06-06T06:22:09  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: I'll pretend you didnt say that
2011-06-06T06:22:23  <AutomatedTester> seeing as most companies are on 2.6
2011-06-06T06:22:37  <AutomatedTester> or a mix of 2.5 and 2.6

2011-06-06T06:28:04  <jimevans> heh. no, i love my company. i just believe in lowering the barrier to entry for our dev team running our tests if required.
2011-06-06T06:28:19  <jimevans> since they're creating a java-based app, that means we should code our tests in java.
2011-06-06T06:28:37  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: I disagree with that last statement
2011-06-06T06:29:09  <AutomatedTester> write tests in the language that gets the most out of your tests
2011-06-06T06:29:10  <jimevans> again, it's all about lowering the "barrier to entry"

2011-06-06T07:09:30  <eranm> barancev, indeed. And it wouldn't, because the events are sent directly to the browser window, the OS wouldn't interpret them further
2011-06-06T07:10:57  <barancev> eranm: and this event is meaningless, because in real life it can never go to browser window

2011-06-06T07:30:52  <barancev> for DND I think that we have to draw an imaginary line from the current mouse position to the new position, find the point where it crosses canvas and drop to this point

2011-06-06T08:22:26  <simonstewart> Starting to fall out of love with IE
2011-06-06T08:22:27  <Archdude> polm:         try: self.failIf(sel.is_element_present("campaignId"))
2011-06-06T08:22:55  <jimevans> simonstewart: that makes a presumption that it was lovable in the first place. also, hi.
2011-06-06T08:23:02  <Archdude> I run Win7 on vmware fusion but I can't effectively run other versions of windows simultaneously
2011-06-06T08:23:11  <Archdude> in order to test IE6, 7, 8, 9
2011-06-06T08:23:18  <Archdude> (a lot of our users in china still use IE6)
2011-06-06T08:23:28  <simonstewart> jimevans: hi
2011-06-06T08:23:45  <andytinkham> Archdude: That's outside of my expertise alas - I've done my windows testing on a separate pc not in Fusion
2011-06-06T08:23:46  <Archdude> anyone have a good setup for that on a single machine?
2011-06-06T08:24:16  <polm> Thanks, thought I was wondering if there was something that wouldn't throw an exception.
2011-06-06T08:24:26  <Archdude> I no longer have other machines to work with just my imac
2011-06-06T08:24:31  <polm> Oh, wait, nevermind
2011-06-06T08:25:14  <jimevans> Archdude: If you want to run different versions of IE on the same installation of Windows (real or virtual), you're out of luck.
2011-06-06T08:25:16  <andytinkham> Archdude: Could you use some sort of Applescript or something like that to launch the appropriate VM and kick off the tests when it's needed?
2011-06-06T08:25:27  <Archdude> yeah, that's what i figured
2011-06-06T08:26:40  <Archdude> jimevans: well I wanted to run multiple VM's at the same time
2011-06-06T08:26:58  <Archdude> i usually use those compatibility images that microsoft provides
2011-06-06T08:27:05  <jimevans> that shouldn't be a problem, i wouldn't think.
2011-06-06T08:27:27  <jimevans> as long as you've got the memory on your host machine to run them simultaneously.
2011-06-06T08:27:30  <Archdude> vmware fusion wont boot more than one it seems
2011-06-06T08:27:43  <freynaud> fusion is a bad choice
2011-06-06T08:27:45  <jimevans> ah, so it's a tool problem.
2011-06-06T08:27:48  <Archdude> what do you recommend
2011-06-06T08:27:49  <freynaud> it doesn't have an API
2011-06-06T08:27:51  <Archdude> that's what i was getting at
2011-06-06T08:28:02  <freynaud> use workstation or above
2011-06-06T08:28:04  <Archdude> which tools you guys have used or like
2011-06-06T08:28:24  <freynaud> i use VIX + vSpherez web services
2011-06-06T08:28:45  <freynaud> but that's a huge upfront cost if your company doesn't have that already
2011-06-06T08:28:49  <jimevans> Archdude: many people try to run multiple versions of IE on the same (virtual) machine, and there's nothing but pain down that road.
2011-06-06T08:29:13  <freynaud> the good thing is you can use grid to help you with that :)
2011-06-06T08:29:23  <Archdude> :P
2011-06-06T08:32:02  <Archdude> it would actually be easier if I was running windows since I could just run multiple instances of virtual pc inside of the win installation
2011-06-06T08:32:21  <freynaud> virtual PC doesn't have API access does it ?
2011-06-06T08:32:24  <Archdude> maybe I can just launch them via win7
2011-06-06T08:32:30  <Archdude> to save a lot of headache
2011-06-06T08:32:41  <Archdude> not too sure
2011-06-06T08:32:56  <freynaud> if you want to use workstation or instance
2011-06-06T08:33:10  <freynaud> was you can do is install windows with a version of IE
2011-06-06T08:33:15  <freynaud> take a snapshot
2011-06-06T08:33:23  <freynaud> update to  version ++
2011-06-06T08:33:25  <nitin__> I downloaded selenium-server-standalone-2.0rc2.jar for WebDriver but I cannot find WebDriverBackedSelenium Class in it . Is it designed or bug ?
2011-06-06T08:33:29  *** c089 has quit IRC
2011-06-06T08:33:53  <freynaud> - : you won't have them all at the same time, + reverting snapshot is fast
2011-06-06T08:34:49  <freynaud> assuming you have time and want to use grid, you can use an implementation for a node that does something like : when IE version X is requested for the VM node, revert to snasphot X
2011-06-06T08:35:17  <freynaud> so you kind of have all IE on the same win instance
2011-06-06T08:35:40  <Archdude> that would be great

2011-06-06T09:14:47  <adamgoucher> samitbadle are you doing a re-write of the export code or just figuring out all the magic bits to override?
2011-06-06T09:15:08  <samitbadle> both
2011-06-06T09:15:40  <samitbadle> basically existing code will be refactored into two branches rc and se2
2011-06-06T09:16:08  <samitbadle> In a way that existing formatters will not be broken.
2011-06-06T09:16:25  <adamgoucher> i still want only one formatter plugin per language
2011-06-06T09:16:49  <samitbadle> That will be difficult
2011-06-06T09:17:08  <adamgoucher> its plugin madness! :)
2011-06-06T09:17:12  <samitbadle> you have more than one test framework per language.
2011-06-06T09:17:27  <adamgoucher> ya, but we dont have to support each
2011-06-06T09:18:19  <adamgoucher> the java rc one handled the differences between junit and testng by sharing a base formatter (that the end user didnt see)
2011-06-06T09:18:35  *** denizt has joined #selenium
2011-06-06T09:18:53  <adamgoucher> davehunt|away already had some webdriver formatters written -- have you looked at those one?
2011-06-06T09:20:38  <samitbadle> well, they can share code, but the end user will see two options.

2011-06-06T09:21:39  <davehunt> my formatters were just webdriver backed selenium
2011-06-06T09:21:40  <adamgoucher> there is also schemes a foot to make selenese not the default language, but something like https://github.com/gfxmonk/coffee-spec
2011-06-06T09:22:10  *** Spanktar has quit IRC
2011-06-06T09:22:25  <samitbadle> well, there are always schemes, but people often forget the true purpose of SeIDE
2011-06-06T09:22:39  <adamgoucher> two, three or four options from one plugin is completely desirable -- but just one 'java' plugin

2011-06-06T09:22:52  <barancev> now, while almost all the crew is on board -- what is the roadmap to the next release?
2011-06-06T09:23:10  <samitbadle> which is to help manual testers transition to true automated testing using a programming language.
2011-06-06T09:23:13  <adamgoucher> barancev: there isnt one outside of simonstewart's brain
2011-06-06T09:23:34  <samitbadle> and nothing is as simple as selenese.
2011-06-06T09:23:55  <davehunt> right, time for vacation. ttfn
2011-06-06T09:24:28  <adamgoucher> samitbadle: the problem is is that it is actually too simple and the leap too large in a lot of situations
2011-06-06T09:24:31  <samitbadle> Have a great vacation Dave! got too busy with the Se2 and other stuff
2011-06-06T09:25:50  <samitbadle> too simple is good to start with, and begins the slow learning process to pick up new skills.
2011-06-06T09:26:10  *** davehunt has quit IRC
2011-06-06T09:26:21  <barancev> simonstewart: all our eyes on you :) what has to be done for rc3?
2011-06-06T09:26:48  <samitbadle> we can do something to make that leap easier.
2011-06-06T09:27:10  <jimevans> samitbadle: that's where you and I disagree. too often, i find people stopping just at the point where they get something they *think* works
2011-06-06T09:27:22  <jimevans> (but in reality is fragile and won't work for long)
2011-06-06T09:28:06  <adamgoucher> but that implies that people want to pick up new skills and they are in an environment that fosters it. selenese can't grow turing complete-ish things which they need for too-advanced-for-tables-but-not-worth-full-xunit -- so js (being in the browser) could be an option
2011-06-06T09:28:35  <samitbadle> btw Adam, there will only be one Java plugin, the se2 will be embedded into the existing Java plugin, the generic infrastructure code will ofcourse be in SeIDE itself
2011-06-06T09:28:57  <adamgoucher> thats all i needed to hear :)
2011-06-06T09:29:52  <adamgoucher> with that, i'm off for coffee and to try and find the paperwork that says what i worked on the second week of may to complete my damnable billing
2011-06-06T09:30:48  <samitbadle> Jim, I think it is for each person to decide how much investment is enough. General trend in sw development is often to trade robustness in favor of instant gratification and automated testing is exception
2011-06-06T09:31:16  <samitbadle> adam, I thought I replied to your tweet about it as well, but never  mind.
2011-06-06T09:31:34  *** Spanktar has quit IRC
2011-06-06T09:31:43  <samitbadle> I fully agree that one plugin per language that includes all variations is a good option indeed.

2011-06-06T10:02:30  <rlpowell> My testing requires fairly complicated/detailed drag-and-drop, so I've been testing 2.0/HEAD pretty hard.
2011-06-06T10:03:04  <eranm> hi
2011-06-06T10:03:12  <eranm> I saw the thread
2011-06-06T10:03:24  <rlpowell> *nod*
2011-06-06T10:03:26  <eranm> basically there are several issues with mouse movement that should be fixed
2011-06-06T10:03:34  <eranm> See issue 1771
2011-06-06T10:04:17  <eranm> In addition, handling of coordinates below zero / above the canvas size are not handled correctly at the moment
2011-06-06T10:05:18  <rlpowell> Is zero the top line of the visible window, or top of the whole document?
2011-06-06T10:05:28  <rlpowell> Because the problems I was finding was in the former case.
2011-06-06T10:06:18  <eranm> There are two separate cases which we should take care of: One is when trying to move to a coordinate that's above the whole document ("absolute zero")
2011-06-06T10:06:56  <eranm> and the other one is, after an element has been scrolled into view, moving above the viewport to coordinates which are in the canvas but not in the viewport

2011-06-06T10:11:06  <rlpowell> *nod*
2011-06-06T10:11:06  <eranm> For the second case, we have to store coordinates both on the screen and on the DOM - my action item immediately after solving the first case :)

2011-06-06T10:45:23  <adamgoucher> so who is going to risk the 0 day release of the osx lion build to see how busted se is there? :)
2011-06-06T10:45:41  <simonstewart> Has the price been announced?
2011-06-06T10:46:09  <simonstewart> 30bucks
2011-06-06T10:46:44  <simonstewart> might be tempted
2011-06-06T10:46:48  <simonstewart> I mean, how bad can it be?
2011-06-06T10:46:55  <adamgoucher> heh!
2011-06-06T10:47:16  <adamgoucher> seems to me it took 6 or 7 months to fix a linking problem with snow leopard :)
2011-06-06T10:47:27  <simonstewart> That's because no-one had snow leopard
2011-06-06T10:47:31  <simonstewart> Hmm... dinner
2011-06-06T10:47:35  <simonstewart> biab
2011-06-06T10:47:45  <adamgoucher> ios 5 has 1500 new apis. thats just a dumb amount.

2011-06-06T11:02:49  <barancev> I need an advice about #1758
2011-06-06T11:02:49  <selbot2>  open/new Selenium RC doesn't close popup windows properly - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1758
2011-06-06T11:03:02  *** sjmikem has left #selenium
2011-06-06T11:04:50  <barancev> when selenium opens a new windows, it registers window name in openedWindows map, but never remove it from the map
2011-06-06T11:05:25  <barancev> the question is -- where is the best place to remove closed window from the openedWindow map?
2011-06-06T11:06:02  <barancev> it can be done in close method, but what about windows closed by javascript? how to handle them?
2011-06-06T11:07:22  <barancev> is there any method that is called after a window has been closed?
2011-06-06T11:08:41  <barancev> (I mean 1.0 API)
2011-06-06T11:11:17  <simonstewart> nope
2011-06-06T11:12:59  <barancev> is it ever possible in theory?
2011-06-06T11:13:13  <simonstewart> Reliably? I don't think so
2011-06-06T11:13:20  <simonstewart> Unreliably? Yes
2011-06-06T11:13:26  <simonstewart> And that might be Good Enough
2011-06-06T11:13:45  <barancev> override some js methods than can close window?
2011-06-06T11:13:55  <simonstewart> window.close

2011-06-06T11:43:00  <AutomatedTester> jarib: do you know what happens if I ask remotewebdriver for a browser and the wrong platform
2011-06-06T11:43:25  <AutomatedTester> e.g. browserName: 'firefox', platform:'WINDOWS' on my mac
2011-06-06T11:43:32  * AutomatedTester hasnt got stuff setup so asking
2011-06-06T11:43:38  <jarib> i assume it will launch firefox, but i don't know
2011-06-06T11:43:52  <AutomatedTester> ok... will have to set something up
2011-06-06T11:44:12  <jarib> i think i have the server jar here somewhere, give me a sec
2011-06-06T11:44:34  <AutomatedTester> sorry, I just fubared my dev environment
2011-06-06T11:45:29  <freynaud> AutomatedTester: yes ?
2011-06-06T11:46:29  <jarib> AutomatedTester: it does launch firefox on linux even when i asked for windows
2011-06-06T11:46:38  <jarib> grid may be stricter though
2011-06-06T11:47:10  <freynaud> grid validates version, pltform and browser, if specified
2011-06-06T11:47:23  <freynaud> but you can provide a new matching strategy
2011-06-06T11:47:37  <freynaud> like linux for windows is ok, but not the other way around
2011-06-06T11:47:45  <jarib> right
2011-06-06T11:47:47  <jarib> makes sense
2011-06-06T11:47:57  <freynaud> the server doesn't do that
2011-06-06T11:48:05  <freynaud> it gives you a best match I think
2011-06-06T11:48:10  <jarib> yep
2011-06-06T11:49:21  <AutomatedTester> thanks guys!
2011-06-06T11:50:19  <jarib> heh, asking for IE on Windows with the server running on linux appears to give me htmlunit
2011-06-06T11:50:39  <jarib> but the capabilities returned does say it's IE on Win :P
2011-06-06T11:50:45  <AutomatedTester> jarib: you did ask for 1/2 a browser...
2011-06-06T11:50:53  <XCulver> AC has been down in the office all day, its 80 outside....
2011-06-06T11:51:30  <jimevans> i believe the server goes through a matching algorithm and returns a "best fit" with the desired capabilities you ask for.
2011-06-06T11:51:43  <jimevans> at least, i think i remember seeing server code that did that.
2011-06-06T11:51:47  <jarib> yes
2011-06-06T11:52:03  <jarib> although the returned capabilities aren't right..
2011-06-06T11:52:29  <AutomatedTester> <- doing a code review and someone set MAC as the default platform which is alright for my team but no good for contributors
2011-06-06T11:52:33  <freynaud> the return isn't reliable, and returns different things based on the browser
2011-06-06T11:52:42  <jarib> caps has IE/Win with JS enabled, when it's in fact HtmlUnit with JS disabled
2011-06-06T11:52:44  <freynaud> if you launch IE, FF and chrome on windows
2011-06-06T11:52:50  <freynaud> and look at the return cap
2011-06-06T11:52:56  <freynaud> you have 3 diff platform :)

2011-06-06T11:53:44  <freynaud> it's not completly wrong
2011-06-06T11:53:47  <jarib> i'd expect it to return the actual caps
2011-06-06T11:53:53  <freynaud> it's like WINDOWS vs VISTA
2011-06-06T11:54:13  <jarib> ah
2011-06-06T11:55:12  <jarib> still, i'd expect it to get things like browser name and js enabled right..
2011-06-06T11:57:14  <freynaud> that would be great for grid :) launch it once, and you know what to register
2011-06-06T11:58:29  <freynaud> actually, it would be good to also be able to call driver.getCapabilities on a driver not launched yet
2011-06-06T11:58:41  *** curseg has left #selenium

2011-06-06T15:48:38  <autojack> I know about brittle. not sure if I can use a css locator in this case.
2011-06-06T15:49:27  <autojack> the CSS path that I get from firebug looks about as whacky as the xpath.
2011-06-06T15:49:31  <sfbrian> tunabum: css locators can be written just as brittle as xpath
2011-06-06T15:49:43  <tunabum> sfbrian: very true
2011-06-06T15:50:13  <autojack> and the Ruby find_element() method doesn't list CSS as a locator it can use.
2011-06-06T15:50:15  <autojack> that seems weird though
2011-06-06T15:50:34  <autojack> it accepts: :class, :class_name, :id, :link_text, :link, :partial_link_text, :name, :tag_name, :xpath
2011-06-06T15:52:32  <tunabum> autojack: any chance you can request an ID put on your element (I always push for that)?  i don't know the ruby bindings, sry
2011-06-06T15:53:13  <jarib> autojack: where are you seeing that list?

2011-06-06T18:25:00  <wanderso> I'm having trouble reading the source; does anyone know what kind of exception getAttribute returns when it's asked to find a nonexistent attribute? The stack trace just reads "Exception: ERROR: Could not find element attribute:"

2011-06-06T20:45:48  <L4nce0> hey guy, so I'm having a terrible time getting a basic project to work with selenium. In essence I think my issue is I have no idea how to launch this "selenium server" in conjunction with my eclipse project
2011-06-06T20:50:40  <L4nce0> I can get it to run, just by having java handle it.. that's a start.. but I rather give my boss a program where all he has to do is press a button...
2011-06-06T20:51:08  <L4nce0> most bosses can handle one button ;)
