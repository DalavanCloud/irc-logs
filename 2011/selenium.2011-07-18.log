2011-07-18T02:22:25  <papegaaij> which driver do you think would be faster? firefox or chrome?
2011-07-18T02:22:37  <simonstewart> depends, but probably chrome
2011-07-18T02:22:40  *** Mayank has quit IRC
2011-07-18T02:22:44  <simonstewart> And the opera driver is incredibly fast

2011-07-18T02:23:12  <papegaaij> too bad htmlunit doesn't work
2011-07-18T02:23:24  *** trendy has quit IRC
2011-07-18T02:23:36  <simonstewart> Are you enabling JS in the HtmlUnitDriver?
2011-07-18T02:24:05  <papegaaij> well, with js it doesn't work because the it can't cope with the js that commes with wicket
2011-07-18T02:24:14  <simonstewart> Ahhh...
2011-07-18T02:24:19  <papegaaij> and without js it doesn't work because i need js to get some nodes from the dom
2011-07-18T02:24:43  <simonstewart> k
2011-07-18T02:25:04  <papegaaij> it would be really neat if some more comprehensive dom inspection would be available
2011-07-18T02:25:27  <simonstewart> what would that look like? Firebug?
2011-07-18T02:25:38  <papegaaij> no, in code
2011-07-18T02:25:49  <simonstewart> So what would it look like?
2011-07-18T02:25:55  <papegaaij> for example, WebElement.getText() only returns visible text
2011-07-18T02:26:10  <papegaaij> but the node i'm trying to read is invisible
2011-07-18T02:26:11  <simonstewart> by design
2011-07-18T02:26:14  <papegaaij> i understand
2011-07-18T02:26:36  <simonstewart> ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("return arguments[0].nodeValue;", element);
2011-07-18T02:26:39  <papegaaij> but next to this api, a dom inspection api would really help
2011-07-18T02:26:52  <papegaaij> but that statement doesn't work with javascript disabled :)
2011-07-18T02:27:04  <simonstewart> But you're not using htmlunit anyway
2011-07-18T02:27:12  <papegaaij> i wanted to use it
2011-07-18T02:27:28  <papegaaij> but i can't, because i can't read the nodes i need

2011-07-18T02:30:08  <papegaaij> for htmlunit, it can operate directly on the dom, for all other browser it should use js

2011-07-18T03:03:31  <papegaaij> jarib: perhaps the problem is that /usr/bin/chromium-browser is a shell script?
2011-07-18T03:04:22  <jarib> maybe
2011-07-18T03:04:27  <papegaaij> the real path is /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromium-browser

2011-07-18T03:33:06  <simonstewart> So, after 2.1 is out, what about we actually make the move to JUnit 4?
2011-07-18T03:33:29  <simonstewart> The thing that's stopping me at the moment is the yak-shaving exercise of creating the test suites
2011-07-18T03:33:38  <simonstewart> Which we do dynamically
2011-07-18T03:33:47  <simonstewart> But if _don't_ do that, things get a lot easier

2011-07-18T03:40:17  <jimevans> g'day.
2011-07-18T03:40:22  <simonstewart> That's an early start
2011-07-18T03:41:14  <freynaud> simonstewart: only the end to end part still has it. But I need to learn more junit to finish. I ended up having to manage a lot of thread directly in the tests for the junit conversion.
2011-07-18T03:41:32  <simonstewart> That's not so much fun
2011-07-18T03:41:38  <simonstewart> But I see you'll in Camden tomorrow
2011-07-18T03:41:43  <simonstewart> And I can buy you a pint
2011-07-18T03:41:48  <freynaud> and there is 50% to have buggy tests
2011-07-18T03:41:55  <jimevans> simonstewart: not really. i'm usually up this early, but I'm still at home.

2011-07-18T03:42:32  <jimevans> i'm checking in to see if I needed to build the .NET bindings for release yet (you've got at several-hour head start on the day on me) :)
2011-07-18T03:42:35  <freynaud> simonstewart: I'll be in vacation for 2 weeks soon. Assuming I have internet where I go, I'll finish the testNG removal
2011-07-18T03:42:52  <simonstewart> jimevans: I'm just running the java tests on my linux box now
2011-07-18T03:43:40  <jimevans> i wanted to do as close to a simultaneous release as possible.
2011-07-18T03:44:57  <dawagner> This seems like something we could automate more?
2011-07-18T03:45:13  <dawagner> (Or do we like the double-check-by-human factor?)
2011-07-18T03:45:29  <simonstewart> I like people to be involved at some point
2011-07-18T03:45:41  <simonstewart> If we ever get the continuous builds running cleanly
2011-07-18T03:45:53  <simonstewart> we'll be able to release without quite so much faffing around

2011-07-18T06:20:09  <papegaaij> dawagner: the idea is to keep extending the set of testcases
2011-07-18T06:20:18  <papegaaij> we start with just visiting all pages in the menu
2011-07-18T06:20:28  <papegaaij> the next step will be pressing all buttons
2011-07-18T06:20:46  <papegaaij> and we will continue with writing specific scripts for certain parts of the application
2011-07-18T06:23:57  <olle_hacknighter> adamgoucher: Thanks for cleaning up the website. It makes everybody happy.
2011-07-18T06:26:14  <barancev> yet the sehq main page is se1.0 oriented
2011-07-18T06:28:04  *** nilian has quit IRC
2011-07-18T06:30:21  <barancev> a little UI bug -- http://screencast.com/t/UIvlHj6pY
2011-07-18T06:30:26  <ruel> any thoughts to splitting the user list to 1.0 and 2.0 version?
2011-07-18T06:30:40  <simonstewart> We should keep them combined
2011-07-18T06:30:48  <ruel> searching the lists for relevant info is tough
2011-07-18T06:31:07  <olle_hacknighter> My thought: Let's help the 1.0ers get to 2.0. Not cut them off.
2011-07-18T06:31:07  <simonstewart> What's missing from the docs?
2011-07-18T06:31:19  <simonstewart> olle_hacknighter: exactly
2011-07-18T06:31:57  <ruel> its not that the docs are lacking per se, they've been pretty helpful
2011-07-18T06:32:11  <ruel> but the sort of info that is most relevent, at least to me
2011-07-18T06:32:15  <ruel> is the practical application
2011-07-18T06:32:17  <ruel> such as
2011-07-18T06:32:20  <barancev> the platforms page is IDE + Se1.0 oriented too: http://seleniumhq.org/about/platforms.html
2011-07-18T06:32:26  <jimevans> adamgoucher: one of your favorite topics, incorrectly referring to Se1.0 vs Se2.0. :)
2011-07-18T06:32:55  <olle_hacknighter> papegaaij: Re Checking All Links. http://validator.w3.org/checklink is quite the tool. (I did read your follow-up, but this is quite neat. Perhaps of some value to a project.)
2011-07-18T06:33:45  <ruel> http://rostislav-matl.blogspot.com/2011/03/moving-to-selenium-2-on-webdriver-part.html
2011-07-18T06:35:12  <simonstewart> There is no RenderedWebElement any more: visibility is checked using WebElement.isDisplayed()
2011-07-18T06:35:17  <simonstewart> Other than that, nice link
2011-07-18T06:35:25  <ruel> yeah, i realize that is out of date
2011-07-18T06:35:28  <simonstewart> :)
2011-07-18T06:35:38  <ruel> the point i guess i was trying to illustrate
2011-07-18T06:35:40  <simonstewart> Cos our docs are totally up to date :)
2011-07-18T06:35:44  <simonstewart> Gotcha
2011-07-18T06:35:53  <adamgoucher> i'm going to just do bits and pieces to the site over the next couple days until someone tells me i've crossed an opinionated boundary :)
2011-07-18T06:36:18  <simonstewart> Sounds like we could beef up the common problems section here: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/appendix_migrating_from_rc_to_webdriver.html
2011-07-18T06:38:48  <papegaaij> olle_hacknighter: a tool like that is not going to work for us, many of the links are dynamic and you need a login to get into the app
2011-07-18T06:39:06  <barancev> I've found a way to explain to my clients this 1.0 vs 2.0 difference, I tell them that there are two tools - The Selenium Classic and The WebDriver. se1.0 contains The Selenium Classic only. se2.0 contains both. you may migrate to 2.0 and contunue using The Selenium Classic (with fixed bugs and new supported browsers), or you may rewrite your tests to use The WebDriver.
2011-07-18T06:39:21  <barancev> the names work much better that the numbers
2011-07-18T06:39:43  <simonstewart> Which is why I refer to RC and WebDriver
2011-07-18T06:39:56  <simonstewart> Though I like the Classic idea
2011-07-18T06:40:14  *** nirvdrum has quit IRC
2011-07-18T06:40:35  <ruel> from a practical standpoint, i'm a guy who has used the orig selenium for 2+ years.  I'm pretty versed with api.    I use the page objects pattern, upgrading my testsuite *should* be relatively straightforward.   I read through your getting started docs, wiki, and a quick glance at the javadoc.   I start migrating my pageobjects.    85% is painless.   Then i run across a gotcha.   First place to turn is the mailing list.   Typical search i use:
2011-07-18T06:40:36  <ruel> selenium 2 select window.  This returns mixed results
2011-07-18T06:40:37  <jimevans> I knew I should've registered the "Selenium Classic" name as a trademark. :P
2011-07-18T06:40:41  <barancev> RC is polluted with rc as 'release candidate', I'm avoiding this
2011-07-18T06:40:47  <ruel> @simon, i like the idea of beefing up that page
2011-07-18T06:41:27  <papegaaij> hmmm, what happens if you try to execute js on a page that is loading?
2011-07-18T06:41:35  <olle_hacknighter> papegaaij: http://mechanize.rubyforge.org/ or http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/ or http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize/ But that leads us far off-topic. With these you _could_ test for HTTP Status codes, and any Headers, etc. Just saying.
2011-07-18T06:42:02  <papegaaij> olle_hacknighter: our app is way to complicated for simple spider like tools
2011-07-18T06:42:07  <simonstewart> papegaaij: that's undefined, but not recommended
2011-07-18T06:42:35  <papegaaij> simonstewart: is there any way to wait untill the browser is finished loading?
2011-07-18T06:42:58  <olle_hacknighter> papegaaij: Sorry for continuing a thread that is really about browser automation. Here is me shutting up.
2011-07-18T06:43:31  <dawagner> papegaaij: What do you define as "finished loading"?
2011-07-18T06:43:40  <papegaaij> simonstewart: right now, i'm getting a js npe on "return document.getElementById('pageclassname').innerHTML"
2011-07-18T06:43:58  <dawagner> (And after what effect? After WebDriver.get? after WebElement.click?)
2011-07-18T06:44:12  <papegaaij> so either document is null (seems weird) or it does not (yet) have an element with id 'pageclassname'
2011-07-18T06:44:18  <papegaaij> this is after a get
2011-07-18T06:44:22  <simonstewart> Both are reasonable
2011-07-18T06:44:30  <simonstewart> Then the second is far more reasonable
2011-07-18T06:44:39  <papegaaij> all our pages have this element
2011-07-18T06:44:44  <simonstewart> get returns when the "onload" event fires
2011-07-18T06:47:29  <papegaaij> hmmm, something strange is going on, i check the page for an element with id 'wicketpageid', this check succeeds
2011-07-18T06:47:44  <papegaaij> the next check is for pageclassname, this one fails
2011-07-18T06:47:51  <papegaaij> these elements are right next to eachother
2011-07-18T06:49:51  <papegaaij> ah, found the problem
2011-07-18T06:49:58  <papegaaij> the page is returning a 404 :)

2011-07-18T06:55:31  <jimevans> simonstewart: I've been having a look at the IE proxy manipulation code in the Java bindings
2011-07-18T06:55:40  <simonstewart> It's fugly
2011-07-18T06:56:31  <jimevans> if I'm reading it right, you store off the existing registry settings before modification, and attempt to restore them afterward, right?
2011-07-18T06:56:41  <simonstewart> That's the idea
2011-07-18T06:56:46  <simonstewart> It doesn't work well at all
2011-07-18T06:57:15  <jimevans> how do you account for multiple IE driver instances? (which used to be impossible, but should be possible now)
2011-07-18T06:57:21  <simonstewart> we don't
2011-07-18T06:57:27  <simonstewart> That was never an issue before :)
2011-07-18T06:57:35  <jimevans> I rather thought so. :)
2011-07-18T06:58:18  <jimevans> it was brought up a little while back that the proxy stuff really should go into the native code, so i've been having a think about it.
2011-07-18T06:58:35  <Guest3476> Hi, I've been using Selenium for several years but have encountered a problem trying to run some simple tests on Firefox 3.6.18 on Fedora or RedHat
2011-07-18T06:58:38  *** |izzie has joined #selenium
2011-07-18T06:58:57  <jimevans> the multiple instance issue is the one I see that's really blocking.
2011-07-18T06:59:11  <simonstewart> Right
2011-07-18T06:59:26  <simonstewart> We could just document that all IE instances use the system proxy
2011-07-18T06:59:30  * jimevans thinks it's really stupid that IE doesn't implement profiles like every other browser on the planet.
2011-07-18T06:59:34  <simonstewart> and that setting the proxy for one will set it for all
2011-07-18T06:59:37  <Guest3476> I get an error in the Friefox console of Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE) [nsIXPCComponents_Utils.import]"  nsresult: "0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///tmp/tmpEwmRkJ/extensions/fxdriver@googlecode.com/components/wrappedElement.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 20"  data: no] and there does not appear to be aby service listening

2011-07-18T07:05:12  <dawagner> Bizarre.  I got a private email on my google-code email giving me review comments for a wiki page I have nothing to do with, which don't seem to actually apply to the page

2011-07-18T07:51:38  <Parabola> is it possible to "retrieve" a string within some div tags

2011-07-18T08:01:24  <simonstewart> Good point
2011-07-18T08:01:28  <Parabola> this is fantastic :)
2011-07-18T08:01:53  <jimevans> Parabola: now *that's* something we love to hear. :)
2011-07-18T08:01:58  <simonstewart> :)
2011-07-18T08:02:51  <Parabola> quite a learning experience though, i'm in a java class (why my boss is making me use java for this) but aside from class labs, this is my first time writing any java code
2011-07-18T08:03:24  <simonstewart> I love java
2011-07-18T08:03:33  <simonstewart> I may be more-or-less alone in this regard
2011-07-18T08:03:40  <Parabola> I'm a systems admin, this is my first experience with any coding that isnt totally linear
2011-07-18T08:03:47  <Parabola> or rather, my first OO experience
2011-07-18T08:03:58  <simonstewart> OO is fun
2011-07-18T08:04:02  <Parabola> if you say so
2011-07-18T08:04:03  <QAguy> simonstewart: Hi
2011-07-18T08:04:04  <Parabola> I can appreicate it
2011-07-18T08:04:25  <Parabola> i understand why its fantastic, it just seems like java breaks OO in a few places
2011-07-18T08:04:43  <simonstewart> QAGuy: Hi
2011-07-18T08:04:53  <simonstewart> Parabola: indeed it does

2011-07-18T08:06:27  <Parabola> i hate to ask people to do my job for me, i'm just not sure what to google for
2011-07-18T08:06:45  <simonstewart> Look at the Pattern class in the Javadocs

2011-07-18T08:07:02  <Parabola> simonstewart: i'm using gettext to pull data out of some div class, however its returning more than i wanted. and i found theres a sub class (not sure if thats a proper term) in that div

2011-07-18T08:07:23  <Parabola> :) ty
2011-07-18T08:07:36  <simonstewart> You can do a "div.findElement" to find a child element
2011-07-18T08:08:15  <Parabola> so i've got div.foo and theres a <p> "some string" nested within
2011-07-18T08:08:21  <Parabola>  want to ignore that
2011-07-18T08:08:30  <simonstewart> Ahh... ignoring is harder

2011-07-18T08:10:23  <jimevans> I think we've successfully communicated that the issue isn't that Google Code doesn't support git, but that our source repository doesn't lend itself well to that vcs.

2011-07-18T09:17:55  <simonstewart> It's even bigger than an svn checkout

2011-07-18T09:18:07  <simonstewart> and it doesn't include the branches
2011-07-18T09:18:17  <nirvdrum> I'm not concerned with diskspace.  It'd be nice to retain history.

2011-07-18T09:23:35  <simonstewart> They should be
2011-07-18T09:25:36  <nirvdrum> I used darcs for a short stint.  One of the primary devs was a dink.
2011-07-18T09:27:04  <nirvdrum> I got lectured for using the term "WebDAV".
2011-07-18T09:27:58  <simonstewart> heh
2011-07-18T09:28:11  <simonstewart> I once exposed an svn archive over webdav and wrote a wiki on top of it
2011-07-18T09:28:38  <nirvdrum> Apparently I was wrong for combining two common protocols.  Oddly he had no problem with the term "HTTPS."
2011-07-18T09:29:17  <nirvdrum> simonstewart: Nifty.  I always liked SVN's use of DAV.  It was an interesting approach.
2011-07-18T09:30:29  <simonstewart> Well, it was nifty, but you could blue screen a windows box with it
2011-07-18T09:30:32  <simonstewart> so we backed that out
2011-07-18T09:31:05  <simonstewart> For a while though, we had business folks editing the wiki in word

2011-07-18T09:56:40  <ruel> hey guys
2011-07-18T09:58:27  <ruel> are there any tricks or gotchas on switching windows with webdriver?   I'm using the ff driver.    I click a button which creates a popup.  I'm able to get the original window handle.   I then switch to the popup.   I then iterate through the windows handle.  I expect to be present, but only 1 is.   Is that a correct assumption?
2011-07-18T09:58:54  <ruel> expect 2 to be present, but only 1 is
2011-07-18T09:59:14  <simonstewart> the click may return before the window has opened
2011-07-18T10:00:21  *** andytinkham has quit IRC
2011-07-18T10:03:24  <ruel> no.  i can perform operations on the pop up window
2011-07-18T10:03:32  <tunabum> that also happens when the popup is opened with showModalDialog instead of window.open
2011-07-18T10:03:32  <ruel> i just can't get back to the parent window

2011-07-18T10:05:23  <tunabum> can you manually get back to the parent window?
2011-07-18T10:06:08  <ruel> what do you mean manually?
2011-07-18T10:06:25  <ruel> by clicking the ui
2011-07-18T10:06:25  <ruel> yes
2011-07-18T10:06:28  <ruel> it isnt modal

2011-07-18T10:08:07  <ruel> correct.
2011-07-18T10:08:24  <jimevans> so how do you switchTo() the popup window in the first place?

2011-07-18T11:03:12  <Parabola> i'm failing at this, not sure what im doing wrong :)
2011-07-18T11:03:40  <jimevans> ok. give me the details, and i'll see if i can help.
2011-07-18T11:04:10  <Parabola> I've got an edit box on a page, that I cannot get working.. other boxes work fine by id, or name
2011-07-18T11:04:25  <jimevans> ok
2011-07-18T11:04:25  <Parabola> i even tried xpath on this one. im looking right at it, id="logonId"
2011-07-18T11:04:36  <Parabola> but i keep getting this: Unable to locate element: {"method":"id","selector":"loginID"}
2011-07-18T11:04:53  <jimevans> case sensitivity?
2011-07-18T11:05:02  <Parabola> that was a typo on my end
2011-07-18T11:05:03  <jimevans> loginID != loginId
2011-07-18T11:05:13  <jimevans> ok fair enough.
2011-07-18T11:05:39  <jimevans> can you get the element in the browser itself, using plain JavaScript?

2011-07-18T11:05:49  <Parabola> i'm not sure how i would do that
2011-07-18T11:06:10  <jimevans> for example, using the developer tools in IE, or firebug in firefox, you should be able to execute javascript directly against the page.

2011-07-18T11:32:49  *** sdimkov has joined #selenium
2011-07-18T11:32:54  <jimevans> yes. cast your driver instance to JavascriptExecutor.
2011-07-18T11:33:14  <jimevans> JavascriptExecutor jsDriver = (JavascriptExecutor)driver;
2011-07-18T11:34:23  <jimevans> whatever javascript you execute is wrapped in an anonymous function.
2011-07-18T11:34:41  <jimevans> so to get data back, you need to include a return statement. for example:
2011-07-18T11:35:29  <jimevans> int x = (int)((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("return 1 + 1;");

2011-07-18T12:14:20  <lord1234> hi, how would I go about clicking the OK button to "Save a file" afer clicking on a file download link using selenium?
2011-07-18T12:14:23  <adamgoucher> whats the 'standard' way to manage external jars to a project? other than to use maven?
2011-07-18T12:14:36  <Parabola> lord1234: ...we need more info
2011-07-18T12:14:47  <Parabola> seeing as the implementation from page to page would not be the same
2011-07-18T12:15:03  <Parabola> save file with the standard dialog box?
2011-07-18T12:15:04  <lord1234> Parabola: I clicked on a link to a .doc file, got the standard "OK/Cancel" save file window.  Want to click oK
2011-07-18T12:15:09  <Parabola> gotcha
2011-07-18T12:15:46  <Parabola> driver.switchTo().window("windowName");
2011-07-18T12:15:52  <jimevans> lord1234: Selenium can't handle the download dialog directly.
2011-07-18T12:15:57  <Parabola> although i'm not sure how you'd click okay
2011-07-18T12:16:12  <lord1234> so how would you suggest to do it jim?
2011-07-18T12:16:57  <jimevans> outside of having your own cross-platform native-dialog handling library? I've no idea.
2011-07-18T12:17:18  <jimevans> ^^ incidentally, that's one thing preventing Selenium from handling it properly.
2011-07-18T12:17:39  <jimevans> any solution would need to be cross-browser (and cross-version!) as well as cross-platform.
2011-07-18T12:17:59  <jimevans> think about the difference in the file download experience just between IE8 and IE9.
2011-07-18T12:18:05  <lord1234> i agree
2011-07-18T12:18:11  <lord1234> so is there no way to implement it?
2011-07-18T12:18:25  <lord1234> or would I have to setup a firefox profile that automatically downloads any file without putting up a prompt first?
2011-07-18T12:18:30  <jimevans> i didn't say that. selenium doesn't have a way to implement it.
2011-07-18T12:18:44  <adamgoucher> lord1234: thats how i would do it
2011-07-18T12:18:53  <jimevans> for firefox, you could set up profile settings that would download without prompting.
2011-07-18T12:19:00  <lord1234> adam ok
2011-07-18T12:19:13  <jimevans> of course, that's a single-browser solution, but that might be good enough for your purposes.
2011-07-18T12:19:50  <adamgoucher> http://element34.ca/blog/dealing-with-file-downloads-with-selenium deals with using autoit3
2011-07-18T12:20:29  <jimevans> which is a windows-only solution, but may be good enough for your purposes.
2011-07-18T12:20:41  <jimevans> adamgoucher: added on the caveat for you there.
2011-07-18T12:20:59  <lord1234> i need a linux solution actually:)
2011-07-18T12:21:03  <adamgoucher> the best solution is to not deal with downloads and do those specific cases by hand
2011-07-18T12:22:12  *** antlong has quit IRC
2011-07-18T12:22:29  <tunabum> adamgoucher: external jars... you could use nexus (don't need to use maven... can use ivy or gradle or grape or ...) otherwise i've seen people add to their source control, which isn't pretty
2011-07-18T12:23:34  <adamgoucher> thank goodness for google. its showing me examples of java code that is even worse than mine. don't feel so bad anymore :)
2011-07-18T12:24:24  <lord1234> adam...i've been given a mandate to automate testing of export functionality
2011-07-18T12:24:35  <Parabola> jimevans: i think im missing some fundamentals here. i'm trying to apply what you said about executing javascript. you lost me after the casting :)
2011-07-18T12:25:09  <Parabola> on the page i see "javascript: blahblah(some more stuff)
2011-07-18T12:25:19  <lord1234> which involves handling the stupid save as
2011-07-18T12:25:40  <Parabola> lord1234: is it required that you save the file via selenium?
2011-07-18T12:25:46  <Parabola> you could wget or use curl or somthin
2011-07-18T12:26:01  <Parabola> little hackish, but would work
2011-07-18T12:26:22  <jimevans> Parabola: ok, let's get a little more concrete then. it sounds like you've got some event handler for an element that's wired up with a "javascript:" value in the attribute.
2011-07-18T12:26:53  <Parabola> jimevans: yeah some jerk-off used .jpg buttons that kickoff js
2011-07-18T12:27:00  <Parabola> god forbid we use add to cart links
2011-07-18T12:27:38  <jimevans> ok, that's going to be a little more challenging than just running javascript against the page.
2011-07-18T12:28:21  <Parabola> yeah
2011-07-18T12:29:04  <lord1234> parabola, no i don't have to use selnium
2011-07-18T12:29:16  <jimevans> at the risk of sounding stupid about the problem, how is the javascript triggered? clicks on the images?
2011-07-18T12:29:32  <Parabola> yup
2011-07-18T12:29:41  <jimevans> so an element.click() doesn't work?
2011-07-18T12:30:10  <Parabola> <a href="javascript:callAddToCart(document.searchresultsform,'244060', '1', 'CS' );"><img
2011-07-18T12:30:17  <Parabola> jimevans: how do i tell it what element?
2011-07-18T12:30:25  <Parabola> i dont see an ID theres no link text
2011-07-18T12:31:06  <Parabola> because yeah i'd much rather do that :)
2011-07-18T12:31:13  <jimevans> agreed, there may be an element location problem.
2011-07-18T12:31:33  <jimevans> can you reliably locate an element which contains the link?
2011-07-18T12:31:52  <jimevans> (alternatively, you could use xpath or css selectors to parse out the href attribute)
2011-07-18T12:32:01  <jimevans> s/parse out/match on
2011-07-18T12:32:30  <Parabola> hm
2011-07-18T12:32:55  <Parabola> that would be fine
2011-07-18T12:34:01  <jimevans> something like driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("a[href*='javascript:callAddToCart(']"));
2011-07-18T12:34:09  <Parabola> :o

2011-07-18T12:42:34  <Samit> but driver.findElement(By.tagName("BODY")).getText() can help
2011-07-18T12:42:40  <jimevans> Parabola: or, when that's not possible, maybe the error message is uniquely styled on the page so as to be identifiable.

2011-07-18T13:12:02  *** admc has joined #selenium
2011-07-18T13:12:34  <jimevans> ruel: switchTo().alert() should throw if an alert isn't present.
2011-07-18T13:13:06  <ruel> cool.
2011-07-18T13:13:29  <jimevans> operative word is "should"
2011-07-18T13:13:32  <ruel> ;)
2011-07-18T13:13:46  <ruel> ps.  loving webdriver so far.
2011-07-18T13:13:52  <ruel> this is leaps and bounds better

2011-07-18T13:15:29  <jimevans> btw, I lied just now. switchTo().alert() won't throw. but switchTo().alert().getText() will if no alert is present.
2011-07-18T13:15:53  <ruel> no prob.  i can work with that

2011-07-18T14:48:16  <techwhizbang> seems that when I specify a firefoxProfileTemplate or issue a specific firefox_profile the settings are ignored
2011-07-18T14:48:58  <ieamcam> hola guys
2011-07-18T14:49:16  <techwhizbang> or better yet is there a simple setting that will ignore loading images

2011-07-18T14:49:26  <ieamcam> starting to wonder if im going insane here
2011-07-18T14:52:11  * tunabum questions his own sanity daily...
2011-07-18T14:52:37  <techwhizbang> is anyone familiar with loading custom firefox profiles with the latest selenium server
2011-07-18T14:52:38  <techwhizbang> ?
2011-07-18T14:52:43  <ieamcam> so i have a wonderful question about selenium and IE
2011-07-18T14:53:16  <ieamcam> has to do with running selenium with proxy
2011-07-18T14:53:42  <ieamcam> anyone have any experience with this?
2011-07-18T14:54:42  <tunabum> techwhizbang: java for webdriver you should be able to do this: new FirefoxDriver(new FirefoxProfile(new File("some path to your profile")));
2011-07-18T14:55:10  <ieamcam> err my bad i didn't see that question
2011-07-18T14:55:40  <tunabum> ieamcam: i've only done that with ff so far... but as I've heard you can set the Capabilities with a proxy and IE should start with it
2011-07-18T14:55:44  <ieamcam> i can confirm that is how you choose a profile
2011-07-18T14:55:53  <techwhizbang> tunabum: yes locally that works, however when my CI does it with the remote option it seems to completely ignore
2011-07-18T14:56:00  <ieamcam> wellllll
2011-07-18T14:56:10  <ieamcam> im actually using the DefaultSelenium class
2011-07-18T14:56:16  <ieamcam> as opposed to InternetExplorerDriver
2011-07-18T14:56:23  <tunabum> ahh... then i can't help ya there ;)
2011-07-18T14:56:37  <ieamcam> im getting used to it
2011-07-18T14:56:48  <ieamcam> not having any answers that is
2011-07-18T14:56:52  <ieamcam> :(
2011-07-18T14:57:10  <tunabum> techwhizbang: you need to put the profile in a DesiredCapabilities object and pass that to the RemoteWebDriver call then
2011-07-18T14:57:40  <tunabum> ieamcam: sorry... you'll have better luck during normal work hours for GMT
2011-07-18T14:57:52  <techwhizbang> tunabum: let me give that a whirl and see what happens
2011-07-18T14:59:31  <ieamcam> oh i see

2011-07-18T15:04:48  <ieamcam> i haven't investigated the selenium libraries toooo much
2011-07-18T15:05:01  <jarib> andytinkham: hi
2011-07-18T15:05:08  <ieamcam> but it would be nice if there was a selenium framework support writing the automation
2011-07-18T15:05:38  <ieamcam> i've ended up writing a pathetic little mini framework to do some of this stuff
2011-07-18T15:05:54  <ieamcam> not too sophisticated unfortunately
2011-07-18T15:05:57  <tunabum> ieamcam: not sure what ya mean there... there's a couple of things that can help, look up PagObjects and that design pattern
2011-07-18T15:06:22  <ieamcam> Page Object is a design pattern ?
2011-07-18T15:06:27  <tunabum> in a way...
2011-07-18T15:06:30  <ieamcam> i see
2011-07-18T15:06:45  <andytinkham> jarib: Hi! I was starting to work with the browsermob proxy, and was trying to figure out the path argument. I think I figured out where I was going astray though - I have the wrong version of the proxy
2011-07-18T15:06:46  <tunabum> follows a Factory pattern :)
2011-07-18T15:06:59  <ieamcam> i've actually just tried to replicate MVC without the V
2011-07-18T15:07:10  <ieamcam> i call it MMC
2011-07-18T15:07:31  <tunabum> lemme guess, My model controller? ;)
2011-07-18T15:07:35  <ieamcam> ive created Models to represent what i want done
2011-07-18T15:07:47  <ieamcam> the M is module
2011-07-18T15:07:48  <ieamcam> lol
2011-07-18T15:07:57  <ieamcam> basically reads the model and does stuff
2011-07-18T15:08:08  <tunabum> isn't that the controller? ;)
2011-07-18T15:08:09  <ieamcam> and the Controller basically just ties it all together, reading a CSV
2011-07-18T15:08:24  <jarib> andytinkham: yeah, it's not that easy to get running yet
2011-07-18T15:08:27  <tunabum> ah... module to replace the view..
2011-07-18T15:08:39  <ieamcam> maybe it should be called a componnet?
2011-07-18T15:08:40  <ieamcam> component?
2011-07-18T15:08:55  <ieamcam> its really just something that takes a model and runs
2011-07-18T15:09:03  <jarib> andytinkham: i think some things have changed on HEAD vs the build you can download from proxy.browsermob.com
2011-07-18T15:09:05  <ieamcam> and i've got models chained together
2011-07-18T15:09:12  <jarib> andytinkham: and the ruby bindings were coded against a HEAD build
2011-07-18T15:09:16  <ieamcam> so i can mix and match stuff
2011-07-18T15:09:36  <ieamcam> its not very sophisticated
2011-07-18T15:09:43  <tunabum> ieamcam: sounds like you're doing well then... everyone kinda makes their own framework
2011-07-18T15:09:44  <ieamcam> but its working so far
2011-07-18T15:10:11  <ieamcam> its actually fun
2011-07-18T15:10:11  <tunabum> problem with generic frameworks is it doesn't necessarily fit for every type of app
2011-07-18T15:10:18  <ieamcam> you can really learn a good amount of OOP doing this
2011-07-18T15:10:26  <ieamcam> oh i agree
2011-07-18T15:10:31  <tunabum> as long as someone is keeping you in check ;)
2011-07-18T15:10:41  <ieamcam> haha
2011-07-18T15:10:44  <ieamcam> no one is keeping me in check
2011-07-18T15:10:53  <ieamcam> that's the problem
2011-07-18T15:10:56  <ieamcam> im feel myself losing control
2011-07-18T15:10:57  <ieamcam> haha
2011-07-18T15:11:06  <tunabum> nice ;)
2011-07-18T15:11:16  <tunabum> thus the insanity :)
2011-07-18T15:11:17  <ieamcam> i get obsessed with refactoring stuff
2011-07-18T15:11:18  <ieamcam> mid way
2011-07-18T15:12:02  <ieamcam> so you've made your own framework
2011-07-18T15:12:04  <ieamcam> ?

2011-07-18T15:16:18  <tunabum> and went with a "module" paradigm as well
2011-07-18T15:16:50  <tunabum> even our WebDriver (selenium) instances are modules ;)
2011-07-18T15:17:01  <ieamcam> ohh
2011-07-18T15:17:04  <ieamcam> hmmmm
2011-07-18T15:17:12  <ieamcam> not sure what means
2011-07-18T15:17:14  <tunabum> was kinda nice, since it was easy to upgrade them to use grid without changing a thing
2011-07-18T15:17:20  <ieamcam> you mean you wrapped it up in another class?
2011-07-18T15:17:36  <tunabum> umm... we have modules that contain things... not wrap
2011-07-18T15:18:02  <tunabum> was a way to get one test with different modules to run in parallel without having to do much in the form of setup
2011-07-18T15:18:35  <ieamcam> ahhh yes
2011-07-18T15:18:42  <ieamcam> i know exactly what you mean
2011-07-18T15:18:48  <tunabum> so write one test and pass in a different driver... IE and Chrome and FF and it will launch it 3 times in parallel and each thread will get a different driver
2011-07-18T15:19:07  <ieamcam> ahhh
2011-07-18T15:19:10  <ieamcam> interesting
2011-07-18T15:19:20  <tunabum> and we do it with data "modules" too
2011-07-18T15:19:26  <ieamcam> so are you test cases are in code?
2011-07-18T15:19:34  <ieamcam> we have them in a CSV
2011-07-18T15:19:34  <tunabum> yeah, java
2011-07-18T15:19:40  <ieamcam> ok
2011-07-18T15:20:06  <tunabum> i'm also coupling this with a little bit of Page Object pattern
2011-07-18T15:20:26  <ieamcam> alright ill def. read into that

2011-07-18T15:27:46  <jarib> what version are you on?
2011-07-18T15:28:08  <jarib> i think in older versions you'd have to cast the element to a RenderedWebElement in order to use it

2011-07-18T15:33:42  <ieamcam> yeah thats nice tunabum
2011-07-18T15:33:55  <ieamcam> this is very similar to what i was thinking about
2011-07-18T15:34:00  <ieamcam> having a class for each page
2011-07-18T15:34:30  <jarib> Siph0n: no, that's pretty ancient
2011-07-18T15:34:33  <tunabum> i don't take it literally like that... i actually use a class per Object or thing on a page... cause we have things that get re-used alll over the place
2011-07-18T15:34:45  <jarib> Siph0n: for maven you should be able to get 2.0.0 (final)
2011-07-18T15:34:51  <jarib> (2.1.0 went out today)
2011-07-18T15:34:52  <tunabum> Siph0n: 2.0.0  for maven
2011-07-18T15:35:46  <ieamcam> hmm
2011-07-18T15:36:46  <ieamcam> i find it difficult to really write a framework for this stuff tho
2011-07-18T15:37:36  <ieamcam> i'd really have to sit down and think about it hard, and design it on paper
2011-07-18T15:39:40  <tunabum> there's been a few discussions about it on the user email list lately... might get some inspiration from what others are doing / talking about... i'll pm you a link
2011-07-18T15:40:16  <Siph0n> Thx karin and tunabum!
2011-07-18T15:44:32  <Siph0n> Sorry I mean jarib. Phone auto corrected.

2011-07-18T20:01:37  <adamgoucher> gsoc rates even lower on my enjoyment scale than java. which is saying a lot.
2011-07-18T20:05:13  <ian_mac2> he
2011-07-18T20:05:22  <ian_mac2> I loved the concept of gsoc
2011-07-18T20:05:30  <ian_mac2> but I found when I actually sat down to do it
2011-07-18T20:05:33  <ian_mac2> it sucked
2011-07-18T20:05:39  <ian_mac2> both as an org admin and as a mentor
2011-07-18T20:05:46  <adamgoucher> ya. so i'm learning
2011-07-18T20:06:34  <ian_mac2> will you guys get usable code out of the experience?
2011-07-18T20:06:36  <adamgoucher> i missed the mid term evaluation as i was offline unexpectedly all day friday. of course the crapass system doesnt have a flag to turn on the form past the deadline. that would be too damn simple
2011-07-18T20:06:56  <adamgoucher> from 1 of 3 i would expect so
2011-07-18T20:07:03  <ian_mac2> hehe
2011-07-18T20:07:30  <ian_mac2> the current system is better than the one they had before
2011-07-18T20:08:34  <adamgoucher> and yes, i realize the system was produced by gsoc people, but c'mon.
2011-07-18T20:09:19  <ian_mac2> indeed
2011-07-18T20:09:54  <ian_mac2> if you get a chance to go to the mentor summit it is a good experience
2011-07-18T20:10:09  <ian_mac2> lots of interesting people there
2011-07-18T20:12:22  <ian_mac2> though with your travel and connections you probably come across lots of those anyway
2011-07-18T20:12:55  <adamgoucher> you can never have too many interesting people
