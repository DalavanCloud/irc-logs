2011-07-10T02:41:10  <Mayank> barancev|2:  Hi, I have an element that gets dynamic id (id is added through an AJAX code). When I am waiting for that element with that ID, the driver waits for the element until time out and is unable to find it. How can I find the element?

2011-07-10T02:42:46  <barancev|2> if you can't find it by ID - why do you think you could dofind it by text?
2011-07-10T02:44:33  <barancev|2> do you want to wait until text present somewhere? check text of the body element

2011-07-10T02:48:31  <Mayank> barancev|2: thanks for the code, that was exactly what i was looking for. The other thing I posted is about a test sceneario where - initially there is no id given to a span element, but later by an AJAX code the the span element gets an id attribute, and title attribute. I have tried both explicit and implicit wait for element by id, etc. but it does not work, even when I am 100% sure the element has got it's id that is - even after making the thread to
2011-07-10T02:51:29  <barancev|2> you'd better show a sample that demonstrates this issue :)
2011-07-10T02:51:59  <Mayank> barancev|2: sure, just give me 2 minutes.
2011-07-10T02:54:45  <Mayank> barancev|2: can you open this link - http://dce.edu/web/sections/mayank/moodle/mod/scorm/view.php?id=6 in firefox?
2011-07-10T02:55:14  <barancev|2> I need a username and a password
2011-07-10T02:55:23  <Mayank> Yes, I just pm'd you
2011-07-10T02:55:47  <Mayank> Please enter in Normal mode
2011-07-10T02:56:10  <barancev|2> ok, did that
2011-07-10T02:56:25  <Mayank> If you inspect element on the text - LMS Test Suite - SCO 1Â 
2011-07-10T02:56:49  <Mayank> you will see  a span element with id - ygtvlabelel2
2011-07-10T02:57:34  <Mayank> and if you inspect element on the text - LMS Test Suite - SCO 2. You will find a similar span, but with no ID.
2011-07-10T02:58:16  <Mayank> This span element will get an id and title attribute similar to the span with id - ygtvlabelel2
2011-07-10T02:58:21  <barancev|2> yes, I see it
2011-07-10T02:58:24  <Mayank> with an AJAX code.
2011-07-10T02:58:50  <Mayank> If you are on a windows system you can see it happen in Internet Explorer?
2011-07-10T02:58:51  <barancev|2> ho to make it get ID?
2011-07-10T02:59:19  <Mayank> can you open the same page in Internet Explorer?
2011-07-10T03:02:00  <barancev|2> yes, but in IE I see DOM tree is not the same as in FF
2011-07-10T03:03:14  <barancev|2> that's IE -- http://screencast.com/t/XFHNdH8N45CY

2011-07-10T12:33:30  <ian_mac> that's too bad

2011-07-10T12:50:23  <Mayank> barancev|2: Hi again, the DOM tree that I showed to you earlier is same in FF and IE, the difference is that you were doing inspect element with FF (showing current DOM) and view source in IE. If you do view source in both the DOM will appear similar. I still cant figure out a way to detect those elements.
