2011-02-18T02:52:05  <jarib> AutomatedTester: you can cherry-pick it - `man git-cherry-pick`
2011-02-18T02:52:19  <jarib> if it's a github PR there may be some easier way
2011-02-18T02:52:30  <jarib> usually in these cases i just tell people to fix their stuff
2011-02-18T02:52:34  <AutomatedTester> its on github
2011-02-18T02:52:42  <jarib> i.e. demand a "clean" branch to pull from
2011-02-18T02:53:00  <AutomatedTester> jarib: i will, unfortunately have a red ci I wanna fix
2011-02-18T02:53:10  <jarib> cherry pick works well then
2011-02-18T02:53:11  <AutomatedTester> and waiting will mean waiting till they start in MV
2011-02-18T02:53:36  <jarib> just pull down their changes to a separate local branch, switch to master, and `git cherry-pick <sha>` where sha is the commit you want

2011-02-18T11:02:04  <andytinkham> Is there a way in ruby using Se2b2 to programmatically determine if an element is no longer valid without trying to use it and catching the exception?
2011-02-18T11:02:39  <antlong> is_element_present shouldnt throw an exception
2011-02-18T11:04:45  <andytinkham> antlong: Hmmm, that might work. I'm running into a problem where I converted my page objects to singletons. Now when I reuse a page all the elements from the previous visit are invalid even though the controls the elements reference are still there. I'm trying to think through various ways to fix this (one of which, of course, is remove the singleton status)
2011-02-18T11:04:50  <fission6> how do i gracefully close the brower at the end of testing, i keep getting callback errors
2011-02-18T11:05:36  <andytinkham> fission6: I just call @driver.quit in Ruby
2011-02-18T11:05:45  <fission6> let me try quit
2011-02-18T11:05:46  <LRain> antlong: Yup, same install settings as far as I know! :/
2011-02-18T11:07:06  <antlong> andytinkham, i would imagine the reference is gone by that point, reinitialize the page object functions, or figure out where youre going wrong now
2011-02-18T11:09:46  <antlong> LRain whats his error say
2011-02-18T11:09:59  <andytinkham> antlong: Yeah, that's what's happening. I suspect the easiest way to fix it is to take the singleton module back out. It's not a huge deal to have multiple instances of these classes being created and destroyed in general. I'm still considering some sort of factory which could automatically call a reinitialize method, but I'm not sure that that just isn't overkill
2011-02-18T11:11:12  <fission6> quit and close but throw this to stdout, !!! error running onStopped callback: TypeError: callback is not a function
2011-02-18T11:11:34  <antlong> fission6, just ignore it

2011-02-18T11:12:37  <antlong> windows or mac?
2011-02-18T11:12:41  <LRain> Windows.
2011-02-18T11:12:50  <andytinkham> antlong: I have a single place where any control is actually found by Selenium, so I was hoping to be able to say something like "@element.valid?" to determine if the element had already been found and could still be used.
2011-02-18T11:13:16  <antlong> andytinkham, not good practice.
2011-02-18T11:13:59  <antlong> LRain, and he set rake?
2011-02-18T11:14:02  <LRain> Yep
2011-02-18T11:14:18  <LRain> And rake exists on his machine, I can run it from any directory.
2011-02-18T11:14:31  <antlong> then try, gem install libsml2-dev
2011-02-18T11:14:35  <LRain> All the right path variables are there.
2011-02-18T11:14:36  <antlong> libxml2-dev
2011-02-18T11:14:43  <antlong> then do libxml-ruby
2011-02-18T11:15:52  <LRain> Could not find valid gem
2011-02-18T11:16:03  <andytinkham> antlong: Which piece isn't good? Checking if it's still valid, or the lazy-loading of the actual WebElement instances to delay the time to actually find them until I actually need them (which is why there's one function that every control uses to find the Selenium element for it)?
2011-02-18T11:16:17  <antlong> reusing web elements
2011-02-18T11:16:54  <antlong> just re-execute the code that finds and assigns
2011-02-18T11:17:23  <antlong> make a method per page, that runs your commands that finds your elements and makes page objects, then call that method when you need to return to that page
2011-02-18T11:17:52  <andytinkham> antlong: The way things are set up, I want to find it on the page once and keep using it until I change pages (which I think should be ok). I was hoping the non-existent valid? function would be the flag to say that I'd changed pages and needed to do that re-initialization.
2011-02-18T11:18:43  <andytinkham> antlong: I think we're mostly describing the same thing - I was looking for a flag to do the "returned to the page" thing
2011-02-18T11:20:11  <antlong> andytinkham, are you setting a variable for a page object, then reassigning it somewhere
2011-02-18T11:23:29  <andytinkham> antlong: My page objects currently define wrapper classes for each control when the page object is initialized. Each control actually doesn't call find_element until something tries to interact with the control and then caches that element. This wasn't a problem before because I was always getting a new instance each time I went to the page. Now that my page objects are singletons, the problem is I'm not getting new instances, s
2011-02-18T11:24:24  <andytinkham> "and then caches that element" means the wrapper class caches it so it doesn't have to find it again, not the thing triggering the interaction
2011-02-18T11:25:18  <antlong> why are you not finding it again though
2011-02-18T11:25:18  <fission6> is AutomatedTester in the house
2011-02-18T11:25:53  <andytinkham> My intent was never to cache Selenium elements across page visits, just within a page visit. The across visits is an unintended consequence of converting to singletons.
2011-02-18T11:26:25  <antlong> andytinkham, if youre still on the same page, there shouldnt be a problem with reusing the variable name of the object, unless you are reassinging something
2011-02-18T11:26:27  <andytinkham> I'm not finding it again because the control wrapper itself doesn't (yet) have the concept of a page visit. So it says "find the element if I don't already have a cached version of it"
2011-02-18T11:26:56  <andytinkham> I'm exploring the best ways for that control wrapper to realize that simply having a cached version is no longer adequate
2011-02-18T11:27:24  <andytinkham> antlong: right, there isn't a problem when I'm on the same page. The problem comes on subsequent visits to the page
2011-02-18T11:27:51  <antlong> make a method that will try to use whatever object you pass in, if it errors then find the element and return it back
2011-02-18T11:28:17  <antlong> ie
2011-02-18T11:28:35  <andytinkham> Yeah, I was thinking about wrapping a call to displayed? or something like that in a begin/rescue block, and rescue would re-call find_element
2011-02-18T11:28:53  <antlong> you can override the error class also
2011-02-18T11:29:39  <andytinkham> Unfortunately, not valid elements is just an Error::WebDriverError so it's possible that overriding that would give me unexpected behavior elsewhere sometime
2011-02-18T11:30:00  <antlong> hmn
2011-02-18T11:30:40  <antlong> so make a function that takes 2 args, one is the name of the object should it exist, the other is a func arg
2011-02-18T11:30:56  <antlong> call it like, try_to_use(name, locator)
2011-02-18T11:31:08  <andytinkham> Actually, one possible option would be to monkey patch the Element class to add a valid? function (that simply calls displayed? and returns true after that or false in the rescue block)
2011-02-18T11:31:23  <andytinkham> Hmm, yeah, that would work too
2011-02-18T11:31:29  <antlong> i wouldnt really be doing any of this honestly
2011-02-18T11:31:38  <antlong> but i guess you could do that
2011-02-18T11:31:53  <antlong> youre caching the response of an earlier function
2011-02-18T11:31:58  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-02-18T11:32:09  <antlong> and if the object changes or _isnt_ there anymore, you wont know about it
2011-02-18T11:32:18  *** pnitin has joined #selenium
2011-02-18T11:32:47  <andytinkham> Yeah, I can see that risk
2011-02-18T11:32:57  <andytinkham> I'm trying to avoid finding the element every time for performance reasons
2011-02-18T11:33:11  <antlong> sounds like youre completely prematurely optimizing
2011-02-18T11:33:28  <antlong> finding an element takes at most, ~1 s, if the page is huge
2011-02-18T11:33:36  <antlong> normally its like .2 secs
2011-02-18T11:34:25  <andytinkham> Yeah, I'm starting to get that feeling too. The main problem was that originally I found everything on the page before doing any interactions, and *that* was slow for some pages. Now that elements are only found when I try to use them, I could probably find an element every time and still have performance increases
2011-02-18T11:35:28  <andytinkham> Or even if it didn't increase things, it spreads it out and makes it less noticeable (and a lot of the performance issues were IE/Xpath related, and looking at css selectors is high on my to-do list, so it might become moot anyhow)
2011-02-18T11:35:30  <antlong> andytinkham, just find what you need
2011-02-18T11:35:41  <antlong> you should be optimizing your locator strategy
2011-02-18T11:36:05  <antlong> using better locators will provide much greater speed increases than most other methods would provide
2011-02-18T11:36:16  <RossPatterson> andytinkham: You should look at what the PageFactory class does.  I believe it has just such a lazy-loaded cache.
2011-02-18T11:37:01  <andytinkham> antlong: Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks!
2011-02-18T11:37:06  <antlong> np
2011-02-18T11:37:27  <andytinkham> RossPatterson: I'll take a look at that. I've been considering making a PageFactory of my own, but had forgotten one existed too

2011-02-18T13:21:42  <AutomatedTester> eeek
2011-02-18T13:22:15  <AutomatedTester> https is becoming the bane of Selenium's existence
2011-02-18T13:22:21  <AutomatedTester> first Firefox 4
2011-02-18T13:22:23  <AutomatedTester> now this
2011-02-18T13:22:39  <antlong> yeah, unfortunately my entire workload exists over https
2011-02-18T13:23:02  <antlong> i really wish they included `what we broke` notes in their releases
2011-02-18T13:23:12  <AutomatedTester> +1
2011-02-18T13:25:03  <antlong> these look like some serious issues too
2011-02-18T13:30:06  <fission6> AutomatedTester: I mentioned this before in the channel antlong said to ignore it which I will but is there any cause for me to see the following msg at the end of my tests, !!! error running onStopped callback: TypeError: callback is not a function
2011-02-18T13:30:25  <AutomatedTester> hmmm, its ignorable
2011-02-18T13:30:33  <AutomatedTester> will see about swallowing that message
2011-02-18T13:32:03  <fission6> ok
2011-02-18T13:32:21  <antlong> change onerror=on_error to on_error() on line 264 in driver.py
2011-02-18T13:32:23  <fission6> and is there a way to bring firefox to the foreground when i run it, it seems to be always throw to the back of my windows
2011-02-18T13:32:38  <fission6> antlong: interesting
2011-02-18T13:33:38  <antlong> i think that on_error is supposed to be passed shutil.rmtree, path and whatever exc_info is
2011-02-18T13:33:47  <antlong> doesnt look like exc_info is even used though
2011-02-18T13:34:15  <AutomatedTester> i wanna rewrite a lot of the firefox driver stuff
2011-02-18T13:34:24  <AutomatedTester> i am not happy with it at all
2011-02-18T13:34:43  <antlong> just need to get the crap working first
2011-02-18T13:35:30  <AutomatedTester> antlong: unfortunately distiguishing whats decent in there may not be worth the effort
2011-02-18T13:35:58  <antlong> nothing really stands out as being worth salvaging
2011-02-18T13:36:58  <AutomatedTester> anyway night all

2011-02-18T13:48:51  <fission6> its working, i have seleniumserver between it
2011-02-18T13:48:58  <fission6> it just seems to not be executing js

2011-02-18T14:03:51  <antlong> its not supposed to be there because it cant be used.
2011-02-18T14:05:27  <fission6> ?
2011-02-18T14:05:31  <fission6> i am not following
2011-02-18T14:05:39  <fission6> why is automated tester saying i can
2011-02-18T14:06:03  <fission6> i can't use it by doing python->selenium server (rc)->htmlunit
2011-02-18T14:06:06  <fission6> i dont see why not
2011-02-18T14:07:07  <antlong> selenium rc does not change your python code to java.
2011-02-18T14:07:13  <antlong> i dont see how you cant see it wouldnt work.

2011-02-18T14:28:48  <antlong> what
2011-02-18T14:28:53  <fission6> it communicates via http or whatever to the selenium server which controls the htmlunit
2011-02-18T14:29:03  <fission6> it does work thats the point of the server
2011-02-18T14:29:32  <fission6> its just that there seems to be a bug in my example in terms of not finding an element
2011-02-18T14:30:46  <antlong> thats not the point of the server
2011-02-18T14:31:13  <antlong> take a screenshot of the page in htmlunit, and send it to me

2011-02-18T17:35:54  * jarib is about to crash
2011-02-18T17:36:18  <arex\> i want to store phpunit selenium test cases in a database, then run them and do fun stuff with the results
2011-02-18T17:37:11  <jarib> i see
2011-02-18T17:38:49  <jarib> i won't be able to help you with that (or anything Selenium 1-related)
2011-02-18T17:39:12  <jarib> my suggestion would be to switch to Se2 :)
2011-02-18T17:39:37  <arex\> i attended a webinar about Se2 the other day
2011-02-18T17:39:44  <jarib> i don't think anyone did php bindings yet.
2011-02-18T17:39:44  <arex\> but havn't looked at it yet
2011-02-18T17:40:16  <jarib> yeah. hugs gave a lot of wrong answers to people's questions
2011-02-18T17:40:22  <arex\> :(
2011-02-18T17:40:26  <jarib> arex\: i did the ruby bindings for Se2
2011-02-18T17:40:37  <arex\> :)
2011-02-18T17:40:41  <jarib> and yet another watir impl. on top of it :P
2011-02-18T17:40:53  <jarib> got it right this time though :)
2011-02-18T17:41:31  <jarib> arex\: the protocol is pretty simple to implement if you wanted to do php bindings for it
