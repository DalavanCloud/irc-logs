2011-04-14T09:10:52  <nirvdrum> But should be easy enough to fix.
2011-04-14T09:11:01  <nirvdrum> Mind filing an issue so I don't forget?

2011-04-14T09:39:36  <simonstewart> G'day
2011-04-14T09:39:37  <simonstewart> Briefly
2011-04-14T09:39:44  <christophermcmah> Hi Simon
2011-04-14T09:39:51  <simonstewart> So, let's dig into the problem
2011-04-14T09:39:53  <simonstewart> 'sup?
2011-04-14T09:39:55  <jimevans> hi simonstewart
2011-04-14T09:40:03  <simonstewart> Hi jimevans
2011-04-14T09:40:09  <christophermcmah> here's the thing:  I had 1.0.3.  upon startup it reports oesn't exist; perhaps this session was already stopped?
2011-04-14T09:40:30  <christophermcmah> whoops "<sessionId> doesn't exist; perhaps this session was already stopped?" for 3 different sessionId values
2011-04-14T09:40:30  <simonstewart> OK. So it sounds like the server hasn't got a reference to the session
2011-04-14T09:40:34  <simonstewart> Which is what I'd expect
2011-04-14T09:40:44  <christophermcmah> kill the server and start it up again same result
2011-04-14T09:41:00  <christophermcmah> installed 2.0.b3 on the same host for the first time, start it up, same result
2011-04-14T09:41:10  <simonstewart> it sounds like a client-side problem
2011-04-14T09:41:16  <christophermcmah> right
2011-04-14T09:41:19  <simonstewart> How are you obtaining your selenium instance?
2011-04-14T09:41:35  <simonstewart> new DefaultSelenum()? Or through some sort of fancy library?
2011-04-14T09:42:06  *** XCulver has joined #selenium
2011-04-14T09:42:13  *** kylls1 has joined #selenium
2011-04-14T09:42:36  <christophermcmah> nothing fancy.  just 'java -jar <se> -port 5555 -singlewindow
2011-04-14T09:42:41  <christophermcmah> that's the whole thing
2011-04-14T09:42:50  <simonstewart> So that's how you start the server
2011-04-14T09:42:53  <simonstewart> How are you running the tests?
2011-04-14T09:43:24  <XCulver> what is the purpose of WebDriver.FindElement(By.LinkText("text").FindElement(ect...))
2011-04-14T09:43:35  <XCulver> is it a 2nd search linked to the first?
2011-04-14T09:43:40  <simonstewart> XCulver: yes
2011-04-14T09:43:41  <XCulver> 2 conditions?
2011-04-14T09:43:54  <simonstewart> It should find the child element of the element with link text "text"
2011-04-14T09:44:06  <simonstewart> It makes it a lot easier to break your page into components
2011-04-14T09:44:08  *** sfbrian has joined #selenium
2011-04-14T09:44:14  <christophermcmah> simonstewart: this happens before a test is ever run
2011-04-14T09:44:26  *** kylls has quit IRC
2011-04-14T09:44:27  <XCulver> similar to .FindElements(by.something).findelement()?
2011-04-14T09:44:35  <simonstewart> Eh? That doesn't sound right
2011-04-14T09:44:39  <simonstewart> XCulver: yes
2011-04-14T09:44:48  <christophermcmah> simonstewart: upon starting Se, it reports an error like every 2 seconds
2011-04-14T09:45:08  <simonstewart> I suspect that there's "something" running that's trying to connect to the server
2011-04-14T09:45:13  <XCulver> where as .FindElement( by.something().FindElement(by.something() ) is just nesting it withing the first find
2011-04-14T09:45:15  <simonstewart> There's nothing server side that should do that
2011-04-14T09:45:16  <jimevans> XCulver: so it should be equivalent to IWebElement foo = driver.FindElement(By.LinkText("text)); IWebElement bar = foo.FindElement(By.Id("myid"));
2011-04-14T09:45:23  <simonstewart> Are you on Linux, OS X or Windows?
2011-04-14T09:45:25  <christophermcmah> simonstewart: aha.
2011-04-14T09:45:56  <christophermcmah> simonstewart: I think I know what's going on.  Light bulb just went off.
2011-04-14T09:46:01  <simonstewart> Ha :)
2011-04-14T09:46:14  <simonstewart> Was going to say, you can check by starting the selenium server on a different port
2011-04-14T09:46:24  <simonstewart> java -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -port 1234
2011-04-14T09:46:41  <christophermcmah> yep, it is only one port with the problem.  feeling rather stupid right now.  :)
2011-04-14T09:46:55  <simonstewart> Meh. Sometimes it helps just to have someone else to talk to
2011-04-14T09:46:56  <simonstewart> :)
2011-04-14T09:47:00  <christophermcmah> but boy I sure know a lot more about Selenium architecture than I did a few hours ago
2011-04-14T09:47:17  <christophermcmah> read me a BUNCH of code :)
2011-04-14T09:47:32  <simonstewart> lol
2011-04-14T09:47:41  <simonstewart> That must have been a traumatic experience
2011-04-14T09:47:52  <ato> Speaking of traumatic experiences.
2011-04-14T09:47:57  <simonstewart> Hi ato
2011-04-14T09:47:59  <simonstewart> 'sup?
2011-04-14T09:48:22  <ato> Have you decided on what the plan is for the OperaDriver source code?
2011-04-14T09:48:33  <simonstewart> in what way?
2011-04-14T09:49:00  <ato> I've got things up and running, but I'm unsure where to place the jar, for instance.
2011-04-14T09:49:19  <simonstewart> Ahhh... ok
2011-04-14T09:49:24  <ato> Or should the source code itself be in the Selenium tree, should be an SVN “external module”, … ?
2011-04-14T09:49:28  <simonstewart> So, the code's on github, right?
2011-04-14T09:49:34  <ato> Yes.
2011-04-14T09:49:43  <ato> So Stuk updated the repo this morning with the latest code.
2011-04-14T09:49:48  <simonstewart> Nice
2011-04-14T09:49:49  <ato> (You'll probably have to do another checkout.)
2011-04-14T09:50:03  <simonstewart> I see that github supports downloads
2011-04-14T09:50:16  <simonstewart> So, one option is to put the "latest and greatest" download on the github page
2011-04-14T09:50:27  <simonstewart> And we'll pull in those as a third party library
2011-04-14T09:50:34  <simonstewart> And link them into the server
2011-04-14T09:50:48  <ato> We want to do whatever is the Right thing to do for Selenium here; so Github isn't necessarily a requirement.
2011-04-14T09:50:58  <simonstewart> :)
2011-04-14T09:51:04  <simonstewart> Here's my thinking
2011-04-14T09:51:26  <simonstewart> We'd love it if the browser vendors were the owners of their drivers
2011-04-14T09:51:37  <ato> My question is really whether you want to have vendor-supported drivers in the SVN repo itself.
2011-04-14T09:51:40  <simonstewart> as they're in teh best place to modify the code in the browser
2011-04-14T09:51:45  * ato nods
2011-04-14T09:52:07  <simonstewart> which implies that the browser vendors should put the code wherever they feel is best
2011-04-14T09:52:17  <simonstewart> For MS and Apple, that might be a private repo
2011-04-14T09:52:31  <simonstewart> For Mozilla, it might be in mercurial, or next to mozmill
2011-04-14T09:52:51  <simonstewart> For Opera, github seems like a nice home
2011-04-14T09:53:14  <simonstewart> And it makes it clear that the Opera driver is supported by Opera, and not just a weird thing that the selenium team have invented
2011-04-14T09:53:18  <simonstewart> (if you see what i mean)
2011-04-14T09:53:28  <ato> Sure
2011-04-14T09:53:42  <simonstewart> The alternative would be to give Opera folks write access to the svn repo
2011-04-14T09:53:47  <simonstewart> and add it to the tree
2011-04-14T09:53:57  <antlong> simonstewart: hey gmorning. what were you thinking re: waiting for frames?
2011-04-14T09:54:20  <ato> simonstewart: Okay, so you're basically saying it's something we should discuss?
2011-04-14T09:54:50  <simonstewart> Yes, but I think my preference is to find something that makes the involvement of the vendor very clear
2011-04-14T09:54:50  <ato> We have an internal Git repo which we use for development, but this will from now on be kept 100% in sync with the Github repo.
2011-04-14T09:54:58  <simonstewart> sweet
2011-04-14T09:55:07  <simonstewart> antlong: We'd need to do the same thing for windows
2011-04-14T09:55:07  <ato> The reason for that is that we have an internal Git-integrated tool for doing code reviews.
2011-04-14T09:55:07  *** jleyba_ has joined #selenium
2011-04-14T09:55:22  <simonstewart> ato: then sticking with git sounds like a very good idea
2011-04-14T09:55:26  <ato> Also the Desktop people like to use internal branches.
2011-04-14T09:55:31  <simonstewart> k
2011-04-14T09:56:04  <ato> So we should decide on some plan for automatically fetching external (changed) resources from Github into SVN then?
2011-04-14T09:56:23  <simonstewart> Aye.
2011-04-14T09:56:33  <jleyba_> Is WebElement#getTagName() supposed to return a specific case string (always lower/upper), or return it as the browser would?
2011-04-14T09:56:34  <ato> I mean, we could potentially set up a git-svn repo as well which automatically got updated by a cron job, then do an SVN external-fetch from Selenium repo to that…
2011-04-14T09:56:41  <simonstewart> Which could be as simple as kicking one of us to do an update :)
2011-04-14T09:56:55  <ato> Or that (-:
2011-04-14T09:56:57  <simonstewart> jelyba_: it's not defined
2011-04-14T09:57:30  <jimevans> jleyba, simonstewart: we should define it.
2011-04-14T09:57:45  <simonstewart> jimevans: should we?
2011-04-14T09:57:49  <simonstewart> XHTML is case sensitive
2011-04-14T09:57:52  <simonstewart> HTML is not
2011-04-14T09:58:09  <jleyba_> Drivers need to be consistent
2011-04-14T09:58:16  <jimevans> in what instance would you want the tag name? to find by it?
2011-04-14T09:58:16  * ato beats operadriver's ecmascript-debugger.
2011-04-14T09:58:22  <ato> Stuk: We _need_ to replace it.
2011-04-14T09:58:29  <simonstewart> heh
2011-04-14T09:58:32  <simonstewart> Hi Stuk
2011-04-14T09:58:39  <jimevans> don't we already enforce case-insensitivity for finding by tag name?
2011-04-14T09:58:47  <jleyba_> jimevans: No
2011-04-14T09:58:55  <simonstewart> We are in some places
2011-04-14T09:59:15  <jimevans> i know finding by xpath is quirky that way.
2011-04-14T09:59:17  <jleyba_> find by tag name should do case sensitive first for XHTML
2011-04-14T09:59:23  <simonstewart> yes
2011-04-14T09:59:34  <simonstewart> or rather, it should be case senstivei in xhtml
2011-04-14T10:00:15  <jimevans> xhtml enforces lower-case tag names, no?
2011-04-14T10:00:22  <simonstewart> Yes
2011-04-14T10:00:30  <simonstewart> Or rater, valid XHTML does
2011-04-14T10:00:31  <XCulver> simonstewart: Why does intellisense show FindElement(By.Selector().FindElement(..)...) along with the correct way of Findelement(By.Selector()).FindElement(...) ?
2011-04-14T10:00:38  <simonstewart> But people get things wrong _all the time_
2011-04-14T10:01:02  <simonstewart> FindElement should be the correct way
2011-04-14T10:01:24  <freynaud> simonstewart: Hey Simon. is there a way to pass some parameters to a driver using a RemoteWebDriver ?
2011-04-14T10:01:26  <jimevans> XCulver: That's a strangeness in the API for .NET.
2011-04-14T10:01:57  <simonstewart> freynaud: yes: using the Capabilities object
2011-04-14T10:01:58  <XCulver> jimevans: ah ok, i was wondering if i was missing another implementation of findElement that could be used
2011-04-14T10:02:38  <XCulver> Thanks for clearing up the itch
2011-04-14T10:02:48  <jimevans> The FindElement(s) on the By object must be public so that the implementers of ISearchContext (which live in a different assembly) can call the delegate.
2011-04-14T10:02:51  <freynaud> simonstewart: let me rephrase. To pass some parameter to the executable. For instance I want to start firefox with firefox -p
2011-04-14T10:03:05  <simonstewart> You'd need to add it to the capabilities
2011-04-14T10:03:16  <freynaud> i checked for firefox
2011-04-14T10:03:30  <freynaud> i had to change 5-6 files to had the param propagated
2011-04-14T10:03:43  <freynaud> because the capabilities is lost early
2011-04-14T10:03:54  <simonstewart> eh?
2011-04-14T10:03:58  <freynaud> converted to a profile. Only the profile is passed
2011-04-14T10:04:07  <simonstewart> It should be propagated all the way to the firefox driver constructor
2011-04-14T10:04:29  <simonstewart> That's what happens with the remote driver
2011-04-14T10:04:44  <jimevans> XCulver: I suppose it's *possible* that you call By.FindElement, but you'd need to pass in the driver or element instance used as the root of the search.
2011-04-14T10:05:00  <freynaud> NewProfileExtensionConnection.java for instance
2011-04-14T10:05:09  <freynaud> I think it has to go through that
2011-04-14T10:05:24  <freynaud> and the start(); command takes no argument
2011-04-14T10:05:29  * jimevans really needs to find a way to mark those methods as "don't use me"
2011-04-14T10:05:35  *** towski has joined #selenium
2011-04-14T10:05:42  <simonstewart> freynaud, but the constructor does
2011-04-14T10:07:02  <simonstewart> So if you want the capabilities passed to something used in the consutrctor, you need to be responsible for passing that data along
2011-04-14T10:09:42  <jimevans> ato, Stuk: any chance we could get the .proto files added to the github repo for operadriver?

2011-04-14T10:15:53  <antlong> simonstewart: yeah i normally would, but it would take a while to add that in. how big of a change is it, to add it to the drivers?
2011-04-14T10:16:14  <simonstewart> reasonably big
2011-04-14T10:17:07  <AutomatedTester> antlong: the python drivers dont have a support project atm
2011-04-14T10:17:19  <antlong> hmn maybe i can patch it in to my bindings like i did with se1
2011-04-14T10:17:26  <antlong> would make more sense that way shortterm

2011-04-14T10:35:06  <jimevans> you're a .NET guy, right?

2011-04-14T10:35:59  <jimevans> heh.
2011-04-14T10:37:20  <jimevans> the .net bindings have been pretty stable for awhile, but I'm getting ready to blow them up a bit.
2011-04-14T10:37:31  <XCulver> in what way?
2011-04-14T10:37:43  <XCulver> I just redid my framework here
2011-04-14T10:37:46  <XCulver> that uses selenium
2011-04-14T10:37:54  <jimevans> I'm starting to deprecate some methods that don't feel ".NET-like"
2011-04-14T10:37:55  <XCulver> instead of taking selector types and string paramaters
2011-04-14T10:38:05  <XCulver> it now uses func's

2011-04-14T10:38:14  *** antlong has joined #selenium
2011-04-14T10:38:16  <XCulver> ah, like which ones?
2011-04-14T10:39:08  <jimevans> IWebDriver.GetWindowHandle() and IWebDriver.GetWindowHandles() should be properties (.CurrentWindowHandle and .WindowHandles respectively)
2011-04-14T10:39:12  <jimevans> already done that one.
2011-04-14T10:39:23  <XCulver> ah nice
2011-04-14T10:39:30  <XCulver> i've not had to use those at all yet
2011-04-14T10:40:14  <jimevans> IOptions.AddCookie() and friends should hang off of an ICookieJar object accessed by a property instead of directly off IOptions.
2011-04-14T10:41:24  <jimevans> In fact, most of the methods that take no parameters and return an object should likely be properties.
2011-04-14T10:41:42  <jimevans> IRenderedWebElement is going away.
2011-04-14T10:42:06  <jimevans> (checked that change in this morning)
2011-04-14T10:42:09  <XCulver> woot!!!
2011-04-14T10:42:31  <XCulver> and i see what you mean WebDriver.Manage().ect... feels clunky
2011-04-14T10:42:40  <jimevans> it's very Java-like.
2011-04-14T10:42:45  <XCulver> ok
2011-04-14T10:42:50  <XCulver> my javafu is nonexistent
2011-04-14T10:42:56  <XCulver> aside from it looks like C# to me
2011-04-14T10:43:22  <jimevans> java doesn't have the concept of a "property"; you use getter and setter methods instead.
2011-04-14T10:43:42  <jimevans> functionally equivalent, but I find the C# more readable.
2011-04-14T10:47:19  <jimevans> once 2.0b4 goes out, i'll be able to fix all the warnings i've introduced into the .net build with all of the deprecations.
2011-04-14T10:48:22  <jimevans> but if you have questions about the architecture, and why we do things the way we do in .net, just ask.

2011-04-14T11:13:43  <AutomatedTester> cgoldberg,
2011-04-14T11:14:21  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, oops.  meant to type something :)  hey.. does latest svn trunk work for you (sel webdriver)?
2011-04-14T11:15:03  <AutomatedTester> i checked firefox and chrome about 2 days ago
2011-04-14T11:15:08  <AutomatedTester> whats your issue?
2011-04-14T11:15:16  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, i just grabbed 2.04bdev and I get an error at runtime:  IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/selenium/webdriver/firefox/webdriver.xpi'
2011-04-14T11:15:36  <AutomatedTester> ahhh
2011-04-14T11:15:45  <AutomatedTester> did you just run the setup.py?
2011-04-14T11:16:00  <AutomatedTester> if so, that wont work
2011-04-14T11:16:00  <cgoldberg> i installed directly from svn with pip
2011-04-14T11:16:08  <AutomatedTester> yea, that wont work
2011-04-14T11:16:09  <cgoldberg> (which uses setup.py)
2011-04-14T11:16:25  <AutomatedTester> you need to do ./go py_install
2011-04-14T11:16:39  <AutomatedTester> which builds the xpi and moves files around
2011-04-14T11:16:48  <AutomatedTester> in prep for setup.py
2011-04-14T11:16:53  <AutomatedTester> and then runs setup.py
2011-04-14T11:17:40  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, k.. im struggling with not having a pip installable version avail
2011-04-14T11:18:30  <AutomatedTester> this for CIs?
2011-04-14T11:19:31  <cgoldberg> sorta.. but just in general.. i need to distribute it and have a script run the setup
2011-04-14T11:19:44  <cgoldberg> and the latest pypi version is broken
2011-04-14T11:20:16  <AutomatedTester> its only broken on linux
2011-04-14T11:20:21  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, getting 2.04b on to pypi would solve it
2011-04-14T11:21:09  <AutomatedTester> cgoldberg: i'll see about putting the dev version up for you
2011-04-14T11:21:16  <AutomatedTester> but you will have to specify it
2011-04-14T11:21:22  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, that would be awesome
2011-04-14T11:22:26  <cgoldberg> yup.. so i can do: pip install selenium==2.0b4dev

2011-04-14T13:25:54  <jimevans> jleyba_: ok. the hover test did run, though, yes?
2011-04-14T13:28:22  <jleyba_> "testShouldAllowUsersToHoverOverElements took 0.39 sec"
2011-04-14T13:29:20  <jimevans> thanks. i'm getting an error using .net, and my java suite bailed before that test, so i've got to dig into why.
2011-04-14T13:29:59  <jleyba_> You can configure the java tests to run the entire suite instead of bailing early
2011-04-14T13:30:20  <jimevans> i know there's majick to do that, i just don't know where.
2011-04-14T13:30:57  <jleyba_> rake-tasks/crazy_fun/mappings/java.rb, line 413.  Change :haltonerror and :haltonfailure to false.
2011-04-14T13:31:04  <jleyba_> That should probably be configurable through a flag or something...
2011-04-14T13:31:12  <jimevans> thanks for that.

2011-04-14T13:35:00  <jimevans> why should i have to add an "id" element to the parameters object for the moveto command?
2011-04-14T13:37:26  <jleyba_> most element-based commands get the element ID from the resource URL
2011-04-14T13:37:54  <jleyba_> moveTo behaves a little different: you give it an (x,y) offset, but it needs to know what that delta is relative to
2011-04-14T13:38:25  *** kylls has joined #selenium
2011-04-14T13:38:25  *** kylls has joined #selenium
2011-04-14T13:38:31  <jleyba_> If it's relative to an element's client position, you have to specify the element with the ID parameter.  Otherwise leave it null and the server should assume it's relative to the current mouse position
2011-04-14T13:39:24  <jimevans> yeah, but the wire protocol says for moveto, i need to send an element using "element" as the property name in the json parameters.
2011-04-14T13:39:38  <jimevans> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/moveto
2011-04-14T13:40:02  <jimevans> Unless I explicitly pass an "id" property, it won't work.
2011-04-14T13:40:49  <jimevans> sorry, it says I need to pass the ID using "element" as the property name.
2011-04-14T13:41:03  *** kylls1 has quit IRC
2011-04-14T13:41:56  <jleyba_> oh...yeah, looks like the spec isn't followed :(
2011-04-14T13:42:09  <jimevans> and when I tried it on firefox 4 this morning, it was telling me native events weren't enabled. (i suspect not being able to find the element)
2011-04-14T13:42:23  <jimevans> (or not being able to unwrap it properly)
2011-04-14T13:42:46  <jleyba_> Sorry, I don't know much about the native event code
2011-04-14T13:43:08  <jimevans> whatever the case, it was falling into the else clause at firefoxDriver.js, line 1063
2011-04-14T13:43:24  <jleyba_> But the ID thing is a bug.  The firefox driver always parses out element IDs from the URL and stores it in the params as "id".  moveTo is probably just following that convention
2011-04-14T13:44:00  <jimevans> probably.
2011-04-14T13:44:07  <XCulver> jimevans: any thoughts about adding lambda searches to FindElement? i found someoen who had made extensions for those and use them currently
2011-04-14T13:45:32  <jimevans> XCulver: i'd be interested in looking that over. whether it belongs in the core webdriver api or in a support class is up for debate.
2011-04-14T13:46:05  <XCulver> ok
2011-04-14T13:47:36  <jimevans> jleyba_: what do you know about the interactions API in firefox? or is that eran's thing?
2011-04-14T13:48:14  <jleyba_> It's mainly Eran's thing.  We talked about it a good bit when I was last in London, but I haven't messed with it sense (so, several months)
2011-04-14T13:48:45  <jimevans> ok. it looks like there are a number of the wire protocol urls that aren't implemented in ff yet.
2011-04-14T13:48:59  <jleyba_> Yeah, it's a work in progress

2011-04-14T13:49:57  <jimevans> i really wanted to get rid of the drag-and-drop implementation in RenderedWebElement in .net, but I guess I can't yet.

2011-04-14T22:05:06  <a7p> hi everyone
2011-04-14T22:05:41  <a7p> Im struggling with the python-API for Selenium 2 - I want so set a selector and can't figure out, how to do it.
2011-04-14T22:10:31  <mashiara> a7p: what selector are you trying to use ?
2011-04-14T22:10:49  <mashiara> and and what is the error message ?
2011-04-14T22:11:13  <a7p> it's an html-select with a few options.
2011-04-14T22:11:50  <a7p> i've looked up the source that says select('locator', 'option-locator'), but I want to manipulate the WebElement
2011-04-14T22:12:05  <a7p> .value gives me the selected Value, but I don't know how to change it.
2011-04-14T22:12:46  <mashiara> click() on the webelement, then click on the option
2011-04-14T22:13:47  <a7p> fn'mashiara: ah, thank's a lot, I will try that.
2011-04-14T22:14:59  <mashiara> also in case you didn't know you can run a selenium selector method on a webelement to select only from it's children, very handy.
