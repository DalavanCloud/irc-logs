2011-10-02T12:22:20  <eekboom> I try to make Selenium IDE play nicer with ExtJS. Most important for me is that the IDE chooses the DOM element that corresponds to the ExtJS component rather than the DOM element the user clicked on.
2011-10-02T12:22:39  <eekboom> Any suggestions?
2011-10-02T12:37:36  <eekboom> For example a button is rendered by ExtJS as a <table> element where one of the cells is a <button>. Now if the user clicks the <button>, then I want the IDE to record a click on <table>.
2011-10-02T12:38:20  <eekboom> I tried a custom locator, but that doesn't work because Selenium checks if the returned locator locates exactly the same element and otherwise doesn't accept the locator :-(

2011-10-02T23:38:32  <barancev> because the project has a dependency on gecko-2/include/ that is empty
2011-10-02T23:38:50  <barancev> gecko-6 is not empty though

2011-10-02T23:39:02  <Ajay> i think i am missing something here
2011-10-02T23:39:44  <barancev> let' s wait for somebody who knows more about what gecko sould be used
