2011-05-18T01:03:52  <jarib> johnnywengluu: selenium does have a restful http api, and languages do wrap it in language specific api's
2011-05-18T01:04:08  <johnnywengluu> really?
2011-05-18T01:04:09  <johnnywengluu> where is the restful api
2011-05-18T01:04:10  <jarib> you basically asked "why doesn't selenium have <exact description of what selenium has>"
2011-05-18T01:04:18  <johnnywengluu> haha
2011-05-18T01:04:20  <johnnywengluu> yeah
2011-05-18T01:04:33  <johnnywengluu> it doesn't say that
2011-05-18T01:04:38  <johnnywengluu> just read about all the lang apis

2011-05-18T01:05:16  <selbot2> (+ 5 more)
2011-05-18T01:05:26  <jarib> check the second link
2011-05-18T01:05:47  <jarib> that's webdriver's HTTP API
2011-05-18T01:05:53  <johnnywengluu> ah
2011-05-18T01:06:02  <johnnywengluu> and all the other langs are just wrapping this one?
2011-05-18T01:06:15  <jarib> more or less
2011-05-18T01:06:22  <jarib> yeah
2011-05-18T01:08:00  <jarib> (Selenium RC also has a similar architecture, if that's what you've been looking into)
2011-05-18T01:08:38  <johnnywengluu> hmm
2011-05-18T01:08:42  <johnnywengluu> i want to use Selenium 2.0
2011-05-18T01:08:57  <johnnywengluu> is the HTTP API the same for that one?
2011-05-18T01:09:09  <johnnywengluu> i get web driver has merged with selenium
2011-05-18T01:09:26  <johnnywengluu> will 2.0 provide one API set or 2 different ones?
2011-05-18T01:09:55  <jarib> 2 APIs
2011-05-18T01:10:08  <johnnywengluu> confusing
2011-05-18T01:10:09  <jarib> 2.0 is essentially Selenium 1 + WebDriver
2011-05-18T01:10:21  <johnnywengluu> will both APIs be for different features
2011-05-18T01:10:33  <johnnywengluu> or is it just syntatical differences
2011-05-18T01:10:35  <johnnywengluu> but same features
2011-05-18T01:11:29  <jarib> the underlying tech used to drive the browsers differs between WebDriver and RC
2011-05-18T01:11:38  <johnnywengluu> and is 2.0 stable enough yet to use? is this the doc for 2.0? http://seleniumhq.org/docs/
2011-05-18T01:12:30  <jarib> yeah, it's pretty stable
2011-05-18T01:12:51  <jarib> i know several large companies who's been using it for years :)
2011-05-18T01:13:35  <jarib> i think some of the docs on seleniumhq.org are quite out of date, unfortunately
2011-05-18T01:14:14  <johnnywengluu> years? oh =)
2011-05-18T01:14:47  <johnnywengluu> hmm
2011-05-18T01:14:53  <johnnywengluu> how can i get to know 2.0 then
2011-05-18T01:16:54  <jarib> the google code wiki is probably the most up to date resource, but may be a bit developer-focused
2011-05-18T01:17:03  <jarib> what language are you looking to use?
2011-05-18T01:17:10  <johnnywengluu> im using node.js
2011-05-18T01:17:19  <johnnywengluu> and there isn't a driver for it
2011-05-18T01:17:27  <johnnywengluu> i guess i can use the restful api?
2011-05-18T01:17:47  <jarib> i think someone started on a node driver
2011-05-18T01:17:47  <johnnywengluu> but is that for both webdriver and selenium?
2011-05-18T01:17:53  <johnnywengluu> since you said they have different APIs
2011-05-18T01:18:07  <johnnywengluu> Soda .. that is only for selenium 1 (RC)
2011-05-18T01:18:11  <johnnywengluu> i want to use 2.0
2011-05-18T01:18:52  <jarib> the JsonWireProtocol page on the wiki describes the 2.0/WebDriver REST API

2011-05-18T01:20:06  *** Ivog has joined #selenium
2011-05-18T01:21:46  <jarib> you'd need to find or write a node client for the wire protocol
2011-05-18T01:24:55  <jarib> i could only find one for Selenium RC http://sodajs.com/
2011-05-18T01:26:07  <jarib> johnnywengluu: ah, perhaps this https://github.com/admc/wd/

2011-05-18T01:48:36  <johnnywengluu> saucelabs IDE can save HTML
2011-05-18T01:48:44  <johnnywengluu> i can use that instead?
2011-05-18T01:48:50  <johnnywengluu> instead of ruby, python etc
2011-05-18T02:02:09  <jarib> if you're happy with using Selenium RC, sure
2011-05-18T02:03:36  <jarib> perhaps shoot him an email and ask if there are plans to implement the WebDriver wire protocol in Soda

2011-05-18T02:09:58  <johnnywengluu> since the are still having separate APIs
2011-05-18T02:10:30  <johnnywengluu> Selenium 2.0 is just Selenium RC + WebDriver .. so I can use old API for Selenium RC for Selenum 2.0?
2011-05-18T02:13:09  <johnnywengluu> Selenium can be used with HTML?
2011-05-18T02:13:28  <johnnywengluu> so the HTML will tell Selenium what to test in the browser?

2011-05-18T02:31:28  <jarib> johnnywengluu: it's a bit confusing. you can still use the Selenium 1 API (RC) with Selenium 2 (since all of Selenium 1 is included for backwards compatibility), but WebDriver is the recommended way forward (both the API and underlying tech)
2011-05-18T02:31:33  *** lunks has quit IRC
2011-05-18T02:32:17  <johnnywengluu> ah okay
2011-05-18T02:32:28  <johnnywengluu> so i just use the WebDriver API
2011-05-18T02:32:38  <johnnywengluu> and thats it
2011-05-18T02:32:52  <johnnywengluu> but then why did they merge if web driver was superior? what did it benefit from selenium 1?
2011-05-18T02:38:18  <jarib> good question :)
2011-05-18T02:38:39  <jarib> i guess the brand / user base brings something to the table
2011-05-18T02:39:11  <johnnywengluu> hmm
2011-05-18T02:39:19  <johnnywengluu> so they ditched the selenium 1 entirely

2011-05-18T02:39:23  <johnnywengluu> technically
2011-05-18T02:39:23  <jarib> also, the selenium 1 code base does have some useful things that are now being shared with webdriver
2011-05-18T02:39:33  <johnnywengluu> okay
2011-05-18T02:39:52  *** phdaemon has joined #selenium
2011-05-18T02:40:33  <jarib> and some things only work in Se1, e.g. Safari isn't yet supported by webdriver
2011-05-18T02:41:09  <jarib> but i believe the long term plan is to deprecate the Se 1 API.

2011-05-18T05:21:10  <jimevans> simonstewart: there are cases where if the window doesn't have focus, the event doesn't get processed.
2011-05-18T05:21:24  <simonstewart> *sigh*
2011-05-18T05:21:31  <simonstewart> Do we know these cases?
2011-05-18T05:21:35  <simonstewart> Can we document them somewhere?
2011-05-18T05:22:00  <simonstewart> (can we surreptitiously give the window focus immediately before doing one of these bad boys?)
2011-05-18T05:22:15  <jimevans> not exhaustively. i can point to some test cases that fail (in the .net tests; they're ignored in the java case)
2011-05-18T05:22:37  <simonstewart> There's the classic case of "hover when the mouse cursor is actually over the window"
2011-05-18T05:22:43  <simonstewart> which is always fun to debug
2011-05-18T05:24:11  <jimevans> yeah, that's one. another is in WindowSwitchingTest.testShouldBeAbleToIterateOverAllOpenWindows().
2011-05-18T05:24:25  <jimevans> if it weren't ignored, it'd fail for IE on a fairly regular basis.
2011-05-18T05:24:27  <simonstewart> What's the problem there?
2011-05-18T05:25:29  <jimevans> the test is: click on a link to open a new window, then (on the same page) click on another link to open a second new window.
2011-05-18T05:25:37  <simonstewart> ok
2011-05-18T05:25:57  <simonstewart> doesn't sound unreasonable
2011-05-18T05:25:59  <jimevans> first new window opens fine (in the foreground). second link click fails, since window receiving click is in the background
2011-05-18T05:26:14  <simonstewart> and the link clicking fails because of lack of focus?
2011-05-18T05:26:17  <simonstewart> Furrfu
2011-05-18T05:26:33  <jimevans> it's funny, because the link on the page gets a focus rectangle, but the click isn't processed.
2011-05-18T05:26:42  <simonstewart> Oh FFS
2011-05-18T05:26:53  <simonstewart> We could really do with MS owning this problem
2011-05-18T05:26:58  <jimevans> there's also a problem with keyboard events, specifically the backspace key.
2011-05-18T05:27:37  <jimevans> if the window isn't in the foreground and you're on an <input> element, the keystroke goes to the window (triggering a navigate back) instead of the backspace within the text box
2011-05-18T05:27:47  <simonstewart> hmmm....
2011-05-18T05:27:53  <jimevans> these are the three i know about.
2011-05-18T05:28:04  <simonstewart> Alright. We should document there somewhere on the wiki
2011-05-18T05:29:20  <jimevans> using PostMessage is known to be an unreliable way to simulate user input (see http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/12/21/10107494.aspx)
2011-05-18T05:29:32  <simonstewart> yeah. I saw it ages ago
2011-05-18T05:29:41  <simonstewart> I still don't know a better way of doing things
2011-05-18T05:29:43  <jimevans> but the most reliable way, SendInput() requires window focus.
2011-05-18T05:29:50  <jimevans> dammit.
2011-05-18T05:29:57  <simonstewart> seconded
2011-05-18T05:30:06  <simonstewart> (of course, this is why Mouse and Keyboard exist....)
2011-05-18T05:30:46  <jimevans> not seeing the relevance there. my coffee hasn't kicked in.
2011-05-18T05:31:11  <jimevans> oh, and seconded about MSFT owning the problem. :)
2011-05-18T05:31:59  <simonstewart> ObRelevance: by consistently delegating to mouse and keyboard we allow people to flip the implementations of click and sendKeys to ones using SendInput
2011-05-18T05:32:24  <jimevans> ah. ok i see now.
2011-05-18T05:32:45  <simonstewart> Well, nuts

2011-05-18T05:33:06  <jimevans> i'm thinking of abandoning the "the window doesn't have to have focus" as a goal.
2011-05-18T05:33:09  <simonstewart> The tests I've been running for an hour passed because I'd forgotten to switch the version of webdriver being used
2011-05-18T05:33:16  <simonstewart> krozenvold_: g'day
2011-05-18T05:33:24  <simonstewart> jimevans: It's an important one
2011-05-18T05:33:41  <simonstewart> The initial versions of native events used sendInput, and I got a lot of very shitty feedback about it
2011-05-18T05:33:52  <simonstewart> What I _really_ want is to allow users a choice:
2011-05-18T05:34:10  <simonstewart> synthesized events, non-focus stealing, focus stealing
2011-05-18T05:34:21  <simonstewart> And we can do that using the Mouse and Keyboard
2011-05-18T05:34:34  <jimevans> okay, i guess i see that.
2011-05-18T05:34:40  <jarib> Ivog: it didn't recover and move on, i manually clicked the alerts for the first build.
2011-05-18T05:34:44  <jarib> has been working since though
2011-05-18T05:35:01  <simonstewart> jimevans: of course, once the choice is made, life becomes interesting
2011-05-18T05:35:17  <simonstewart> what will it look like as an API? And on the wire protocol?
2011-05-18T05:35:40  <jimevans> yeah, i was just about to ask what plumbing we need to build into the drivers to support that.
2011-05-18T05:35:51  <simonstewart> :)
2011-05-18T05:36:03  <simonstewart> I think we need a map of device -> implementation
2011-05-18T05:36:08  <simonstewart> with three default named implementations
2011-05-18T05:36:10  <jimevans> and is it switchable or do you make the choice once and live with it?
2011-05-18T05:36:13  <simonstewart> and a mechanism for adding more
2011-05-18T05:36:25  <jimevans> that sounds reasonable.
2011-05-18T05:36:31  <simonstewart> I _think_ we can implement switchable consistently
2011-05-18T05:36:47  <jimevans> i think you're right.

2011-05-18T07:43:31  <jimevans> it's ie specific too, which sucks.

2011-05-18T07:45:28  <simonstewart> the compilation should be pretty solid
2011-05-18T07:45:47  <jimevans> right. i'm betting on a javascript quirk of ie.
2011-05-18T07:46:01  <simonstewart> It's in rake-tasks/crazy_fun/mappings/javascript.rb

2011-05-18T08:12:28  <jimevans> in the language bindings, the native code will just return EJAVASCRIPTERROR.
2011-05-18T08:13:17  <jimevans> when the driver executes the atom javascript function, it manifests as a js error in the browser UI (little shield icon in the status bar)
2011-05-18T08:13:26  <simonstewart> Hmmm
2011-05-18T08:13:32  <simonstewart> Sounds broken to me
2011-05-18T08:13:34  <jimevans> so the error you get in the C++ code is "error already displayed"

2011-05-18T08:14:30  <jimevans> we can't really bubble up more detailed javascript debugging info to the java driver, because we don't get anything more detailed in the native code.
2011-05-18T08:14:49  <simonstewart> Damn you IE. Damn you.
2011-05-18T08:15:07  <jimevans> that's why i had to resort to running the js code in the ie console...
2011-05-18T08:15:12  <simonstewart> Does it fail in all IE versions?
2011-05-18T08:15:26  <jimevans> dunno. at least 8 and 9, i know for sure.
2011-05-18T08:15:33  <simonstewart> 9's what I have

2011-05-18T10:37:13  <jimevans> javascript.rb is at trunk.
2011-05-18T10:37:28  <simonstewart> looking into it now
2011-05-18T10:37:32  <jimevans> how do i tell what exactly? that the files aren't being generated?
2011-05-18T10:37:39  <jarib> we should make javascript compilation look if log=true
2011-05-18T10:37:44  <simonstewart> yes

2011-05-18T10:42:28  <jarib> well, jruby specifically :)
2011-05-18T10:43:10  <jimevans> ok, build is proceeding apace.
2011-05-18T10:43:33  <jarib> i want the SocketPoller class to time out if connecting takes a long time
2011-05-18T10:43:52  <jarib> so i dropped down a level from the   TCPSocket.new(host, port).close   approach i was using
2011-05-18T10:44:03  <jarib> to do a non-blocking connect + select() on the socket
2011-05-18T10:44:07  <simonstewart> sound reasonable so far
2011-05-18T10:44:42  <jarib> of course jruby has trouble select()ing on an about-to-be-connected socket
2011-05-18T10:44:55  <simonstewart> If this stuff was easy, it'd be done already
2011-05-18T10:44:58  <jarib> i can see why, emulating direct access to all the posix stuff in java can't be that easy
2011-05-18T10:47:09  <jarib> anyway, i reverted to the TCPSocket.new approach on JRuby and now SocketPoller has different collaborators depending on the platform
2011-05-18T10:47:20  <jarib> which makes the test fail
