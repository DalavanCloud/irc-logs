2011-08-30T02:22:26  <krosenvold_> why not just use zip
2011-08-30T02:22:50  <krosenvold_> you unjar and then just zip it back together with the proper options for no-compression
2011-08-30T02:23:08  <krosenvold_> or the -0 option to jar seems to do what you wnat

2011-08-30T04:53:51  <krosenvold_> jimevans: Hi. Why exactly does cpp/IEDriver/Generated/atoms.h have to be checked in ?
2011-08-30T04:54:02  <simonstewart> I'm seriously starting to think we need a test page with jquery in it
2011-08-30T04:54:11  <simonstewart> and exercise the crap out of it
2011-08-30T04:54:21  <jimevans> krosenvold_: so that you can build the IE driver dll from within the visual studio IDE and debug it.
2011-08-30T04:54:42  <jimevans> simonstewart: i don't disagree.
2011-08-30T04:54:54  <simonstewart> Though we really should make sure that atoms.h doesn't change unnecessarily
2011-08-30T04:55:03  <simonstewart> I suspect we're getting bitten by mismatched line endings
2011-08-30T04:55:08  <krosenvold_> jimevans: But if you run cfb once first you'll get the same effect, or not ?

2011-08-30T04:56:08  <jimevans> krosenvold_: theoretically, yes, but VS is picky about loading its projects and what files are there and what happens when one is missing.
2011-08-30T04:56:33  <jimevans> ideally, i'd like for someone to be able to "svn co", fire up VS, and begin working right away.

2011-08-30T04:59:29  <djonsson> I am testing this javascript menu on a site. The problem is that selenium is able to open links in the menu without actually having to expand the menu and click on the link. What would you recommend me doing in this case? Would you use ClickAt with a x,y locator instead to make sure that I am actually clicking in the menu, or do you have any other tips?
2011-08-30T04:59:38  <jimevans> let me give that a shot real quick.

2011-08-30T05:13:08  <jimevans> (though I also dropped a copy of jquery-1.6.2.min.js in that directory too)
2011-08-30T05:14:24  <jimevans> what *should* happen is when an option is selected, the div with the id = "output" should have updated text.
2011-08-30T05:14:43  <simonstewart> Down to 52 unread messages
2011-08-30T05:14:47  <simonstewart> Now....
2011-08-30T05:14:57  <jimevans> when i compile the atoms and call the click atom in the IE driver, it works. when I use the atoms alone in IE, it doesn't.
2011-08-30T05:15:30  <simonstewart> OK
2011-08-30T05:15:38  <simonstewart> That's because the focus/blur thing is async
2011-08-30T05:15:56  <simonstewart> You need to add the test to the click_async_test.html page
2011-08-30T05:15:58  <jimevans> aha. so i'm getting lucky in the compled case.
2011-08-30T05:16:01  <simonstewart> Right
2011-08-30T05:17:24  <jimevans> wait, element.focus() and element.blur() are async?
2011-08-30T05:17:29  <simonstewart> Nope
2011-08-30T05:17:42  <simonstewart> But processing the messages is delayed in IE
2011-08-30T05:18:39  <jimevans> i've not had enough caffeine this morning. 'splain it to me slower.
2011-08-30T05:19:08  <simonstewart> Although you fire the events synchronously
2011-08-30T05:19:32  <simonstewart> It looks like IE waits until the next processing loop to actually handle the events
2011-08-30T05:20:25  *** Ajay has quit IRC

2011-08-30T05:39:56  <AutomatedTester> native git

2011-08-30T05:41:55  <Ajay> taking an interview , i shouldnt be talking about it , i asked a person to write a unitTestCase for a calculator
2011-08-30T05:42:35  <Ajay> the person says i am ubnable to think , i wrote unit test cases for services blah blah
2011-08-30T05:42:45  <Ajay> thinking of killing myself :)
2011-08-30T05:43:43  <Ajay> krosenvold_: the person says super is a keyword which gives hidden methods
2011-08-30T05:44:48  <krosenvold_> I often find methods hiding under stuff, but they are never super
2011-08-30T05:45:00  <krosenvold_> It's usually paper

2011-08-30T05:58:08  <krosenvold_> JSR-305 is attempted standardized but does not seem to ever make it into the jdk
2011-08-30T05:58:10  <Ajay> Eclipse supports everything on earth , thats y its too slow :)
2011-08-30T05:58:15  <simonstewart> I'm not a huge eclipse user, and other than maybe Daniel and freynaud, I don't think that the rest of the team are either
2011-08-30T05:58:32  <simonstewart> Use JICP for now, and once JSR 305 is in a JDK we'll flip to that
2011-08-30T05:58:39  <krosenvold_> If 305 ever becomes a standard we can just migrate
2011-08-30T05:58:43  <krosenvold_> Ok

2011-08-30T07:55:56  <nirvdrum> AutomatedTester: If you go to the snapshots panel in the EC2 console, you should be able to create a new volume from there.
2011-08-30T07:56:13  <Parabola> nirvdrum: and it would be much easier if i were to have the ability to tell grid2 to kick off the task on all nodes
2011-08-30T07:56:28  <Parabola> nirvdrum: because im still very new to java (my first app) and i'm not sure how i'd achieve that otherwise
2011-08-30T07:56:29  <AutomatedTester> nirvdrum: I was doing that but being stupid at the same time...
2011-08-30T07:56:30  <nirvdrum> Parabola: The grid will assign a node based upon your requested capabilities.  Once that request is satisfied, it does not pass the request on to other nodes.
2011-08-30T07:56:41  <AutomatedTester> nirvdrum: thanks for helping!
2011-08-30T07:56:48  <Parabola> nirvdrum: i'm not sure you get what i'm asking

2011-08-30T07:57:30  <nirvdrum> Nope.
2011-08-30T07:57:35  <jimevans> Parabola: I see what you're saying. No, grid doesn't have what you're asking for. You'll need to look for a test runner that will replicate the tests on each node.
2011-08-30T07:57:35  <Parabola> thats no good
2011-08-30T07:57:44  <nirvdrum> Something that may help you out though is you can't do anything with grid you can't through a single node.

2011-08-30T07:58:52  <Parabola> jimevans: my first reaction was to add it myself to that snippet i pastebined, but i'm not sure where to start :-\
2011-08-30T07:59:01  <jimevans> but it sounds like you want to get one set of tests, then execute them on every platform you have with a push of a button.
2011-08-30T07:59:05  <Parabola> if i do multiple desiredcapabilities at once
2011-08-30T07:59:10  <Parabola> would that work
2011-08-30T07:59:26  <Parabola> no, that would still leave me with only one firefox being tested
2011-08-30T07:59:43  <Parabola> jimevans: that is correct
2011-08-30T07:59:54  <nirvdrum> Put your capabilities in a list and loop :-P
2011-08-30T08:00:43  <Parabola> nirvdrum: yeah i had that thought, but again, first time java programmer here, i'm not sure how to create that loop to make this work
2011-08-30T08:00:46  <jimevans> Parabola: but also looking to run on these platforms in parallel to reduce run times.
2011-08-30T08:01:00  <Parabola> could i simply create a loop for the capabilities
2011-08-30T08:01:03  <Parabola> and leave the rest alone?
2011-08-30T08:01:07  <Parabola> wouldnt seem like that would work
2011-08-30T08:01:13  <nirvdrum> Parabola: Do you know any other languages?  Selenium has a lot of bindings for different languages.
2011-08-30T08:01:15  <Parabola> it would loop to the end, and overwrite its self
2011-08-30T08:01:19  <Parabola> nirvdrum: no i don't

2011-08-30T08:01:35  <jimevans> nirvdrum: Parabola is mostly a sysadmin.
2011-08-30T08:01:38  <Parabola> i'm screwed :)
2011-08-30T08:02:00  <Parabola> my boss wants me to learn java, so i can be a fulltime java dev here, i'm all for it
2011-08-30T08:02:05  <Parabola> just, learning pains :)
2011-08-30T08:02:09  <nirvdrum> Heh.  You'd probably still be better off using Python or Ruby.
2011-08-30T08:02:13  <nirvdrum> Ahh.
2011-08-30T08:02:14  <Parabola> agreed
2011-08-30T08:02:22  <freynaud> Parabola: you can have the capability as a parameter, and let your CI iterate with all the capability you want
2011-08-30T08:02:30  <Parabola> i've looked at ruby, its much more elegant
2011-08-30T08:02:38  <Parabola> easy to learn, hard to master :)
2011-08-30T08:02:51  <Parabola> freynaud: sorry mate, my CI?
2011-08-30T08:02:57  <freynaud> Parabola: Capabilities.all doesn't really make sense, all for you and me is probably different
2011-08-30T08:02:57  <AutomatedTester> thank god for backups...
2011-08-30T08:03:13  <freynaud> Parabola: whatever triggers your tests
2011-08-30T08:03:14  <jimevans> CI == "continuous integration" server, like hudson/jenkins or the like.
2011-08-30T08:03:17  <ddwwk> Parabola: thanks for the links
2011-08-30T08:03:17  <Parabola> freynaud: correct, but your hub should know what nodes are registered
2011-08-30T08:03:18  <nirvdrum> AutomatedTester: If your EBS volume is still up, you can generate a snapshot.
2011-08-30T08:03:23  <Parabola> ah yes
2011-08-30T08:03:25  <Parabola> i'm not using a CI
2011-08-30T08:03:30  <Parabola> ddwwk: np mate :)
2011-08-30T08:03:34  <Parabola> ddwwk: so short answer, no it cannot be done
2011-08-30T08:03:36  <Parabola> wget it!
2011-08-30T08:03:41  <freynaud> Parabola: what test framework are you using ?
2011-08-30T08:03:46  <AutomatedTester> nirvdrum: using an old snapshot to fix a stupid mistake
2011-08-30T08:03:51  <Parabola> :( i'm not using a test framework
2011-08-30T08:03:53  <AutomatedTester> then will snapshot the newer version again
2011-08-30T08:04:17  <freynaud> Parabola: how are you starting your test ? a main method ?
2011-08-30T08:04:20  <Parabola> yup!
2011-08-30T08:04:43  <freynaud> Parabola: there is probably a way to improve that slightly
2011-08-30T08:05:04  <ddwwk> Parabola: yea, having issues shelling out to wget from the jvm. might re-explore http-client from commons.  but trying to figure out how to translate the driver's cookies etc. to http client
2011-08-30T08:05:05  <Parabola> heres my "runner" (main)
2011-08-30T08:05:06  <Parabola> http://pastebin.com/yshnyeCP
2011-08-30T08:05:40  <Parabola> ddwwk: ah
2011-08-30T08:06:35  <AutomatedTester> and I am back in...
2011-08-30T08:07:06  <freynaud> Parabola: I'm using testNG as a test framework. I specify what to run in the testng.xml file. There you define what to run, and what param you want. For me typically browser + version + OS
2011-08-30T08:07:59  <freynaud> Parabola: then my CI server has several jobs with similar xml file, where the param varies. testngIE.xml , testNGFirefox.xml etc
2011-08-30T08:08:56  <freynaud> Parabola: ideally you need to separate the runs as much as possible. you don't want to be in a position where you go to a dev and tell him to run 5000 tests on 20 browsers to reproduce an IE related bug.
2011-08-30T08:09:23  <Parabola> hmm
2011-08-30T08:10:27  <freynaud> does that make sense ?
2011-08-30T08:10:54  <Parabola> Somewhat, I assumed a test framework was to allow you execute what you want, like breakpoints on steroids.
2011-08-30T08:11:05  <Parabola> I guess i've been coding that functionality myself
2011-08-30T08:11:16  <Parabola> Do i need a CI in order to make this work?
2011-08-30T08:11:37  <freynaud> you define what you want to run. Like all classes in package X and Y that have the flag IE
2011-08-30T08:11:41  <freynaud> this kind of thing
2011-08-30T08:11:50  <Parabola> oh that would make this alot easier wouldnt it
2011-08-30T08:12:08  <Parabola> learning curve wise, am i better off to chug ahead the way i am now
2011-08-30T08:12:11  <Parabola> or stop and go this route
2011-08-30T08:12:35  <Parabola> eventually i'll learn it, i'd just like to make some progress :)
2011-08-30T08:13:02  <freynaud> the CI is an extra layer on top of things. You can live without it, if you're happy repeating the same boring work again and again
2011-08-30T08:13:03  <AutomatedTester> Parabola: I would suggest using a framework already created than creating your own
2011-08-30T08:13:15  <AutomatedTester> its simpler to hook into CIs
2011-08-30T08:13:28  <AutomatedTester> and already has what CI's expect in terms of reporting
2011-08-30T08:13:38  <Parabola> hmm
2011-08-30T08:13:40  <freynaud> checkout the latest code, build, run the tests, archive the reports -> a human can do that, but it adds no value
2011-08-30T08:13:51  <Parabola> agreed
2011-08-30T08:13:56  <Parabola> okay then
2011-08-30T08:13:57  <freynaud> better use a brain for the analysis and let the CI do the repetitive work
2011-08-30T08:14:02  <Parabola> i'm just going to kill myself
2011-08-30T08:14:08  <Parabola> brb
2011-08-30T08:16:31  <Parabola> back
2011-08-30T08:17:02  <Parabola> what CI do you recommend
2011-08-30T08:17:34  * cgoldberg likes Jenkins for CI
2011-08-30T08:17:49  <AutomatedTester> we use Jenkins at Mozilla
2011-08-30T08:18:00  <Parabola> Cool
2011-08-30T08:18:01  <cgoldberg> http://jenkins-ci.org/

2011-08-30T08:19:21  <Parabola> alright, jenkins it is, i'm putting that on hold for the moment
2011-08-30T08:19:32  <Parabola> first I need a testing framework
2011-08-30T08:19:47  <AutomatedTester> I also lead a team of 6 Software Engineers in Test
2011-08-30T08:20:04  <Parabola> cool
2011-08-30T08:20:09  <freynaud> Parabola: I would pick testNG if you're going for java based tests
2011-08-30T08:20:18  <Parabola> i am :)
2011-08-30T08:20:21  <cgoldberg> Parabola, my advice is don't mess with CI until you have a decent suite of tests (with a framework)... view it as a finishing touch
2011-08-30T08:20:29  <AutomatedTester> we work on Frameworks, testing best practises and anythin that might be in between

2011-08-30T08:24:15  <AutomatedTester> those chaps from Yandex are quite nice!
2011-08-30T08:24:25  <Parabola> i assume its all managed through annotations?
2011-08-30T08:24:52  <Parabola> oh i see, and xml

2011-08-30T08:25:07  <Parabola> im going to be reading shit for 2 weeks arent i
2011-08-30T08:25:26  <AutomatedTester> Parabola: there are 2 approaches, and they are framework biased
2011-08-30T08:25:42  <AutomatedTester> there is the JUnit approach or the TestNG approach
2011-08-30T08:25:44  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-08-30T08:25:52  <Parabola> i'm going with testNG
2011-08-30T08:25:57  <Parabola> the documentation page is huge
2011-08-30T08:26:07  <AutomatedTester> documentation FTW
2011-08-30T08:26:10  <Parabola> which isnt so much of a problem, i'd just like to get something actually done :)
2011-08-30T08:27:04  <Parabola> on a good note, i feel a little better about this whole learning java thing
2011-08-30T08:27:27  <Parabola> my first time coding i was apparently creating my own testing framework

2011-08-30T10:05:00  <selbot2>  open/new Jetty jars for android needs to be updated  - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2368 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium]
2011-08-30T10:05:16  <Ajay> done
2011-08-30T10:06:25  <Ajay> berrada: is there any rake task to repackage  jetty_lite for android ?
2011-08-30T10:06:36  <berrada> I'll take a look when I get a moment, and update the bug.
2011-08-30T10:06:43  <berrada> I don't think there is
2011-08-30T10:07:13  <Ajay> should i create an issue for that ?
2011-08-30T10:07:38  <berrada> Would you do it?
2011-08-30T10:08:40  <blowery> anyone having problems with orphaned firefox 6 instances when running tests in parallel?
2011-08-30T10:08:59  <berrada> Ajay: Sure you can create an issue, it'd be great if you could send a patch for it :).

2011-08-30T10:14:02  <Ajay> there is typo in 119
2011-08-30T10:14:14  <berrada> You could add a a new task to repackage jetty there.
2011-08-30T10:14:34  <berrada> hee fixed thanks :)
2011-08-30T10:14:54  <freynaud> blowery: if your system is too slow, you have to increase the default timeout. It's set at 5 sec by default i think, which may be too low for FF to start sometimes

2011-08-30T10:55:58  <vince> having issues with firefox and selenium plugin. i am installing selenium ide from a plugin
2011-08-30T10:56:17  <vince> first this was done on a mac, we got the plug in to install correctly
2011-08-30T10:56:19  <Ajay_> which version of FF
2011-08-30T10:56:45  <vince> oh well 3.5.3, i know it said its not compatible
2011-08-30T10:57:09  <vince> which versions of ff are compatible with selenium ide addon
2011-08-30T10:57:28  <Ajay_> http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/1.2.0/selenium-ide-1.2.0.xpi
2011-08-30T10:57:42  <Ajay_> FF 3- 6 should work
2011-08-30T10:58:35  <Ajay_> its 3.6 to 6
2011-08-30T10:58:45  *** jeichar has quit IRC
2011-08-30T10:59:26  <vince> ff says its not compatible
2011-08-30T11:01:31  <vince> not compatible with 3.5.3
2011-08-30T11:01:48  <Ajay_> the new plugin is compatible from 3.6 to 6
2011-08-30T11:02:03  <vince> really
2011-08-30T11:02:23  <Ajay_> either you need to upgrade your browser or try an older version of selenium IDE
2011-08-30T11:02:49  <vince> Selenium IDE 1.2.0 could not be installed because it is not compatible with Firefox 3.5.3.
2011-08-30T11:02:51  <vince> right
2011-08-30T11:03:00  <Ajay_> yes
2011-08-30T11:03:10  <vince> ooohhhh

2011-08-30T11:03:32  <vince> also new question

2011-08-30T13:11:25  <cgoldberg> mydog2, are you talking selenium API or webdriver API? (regarding capturing headers)

2011-08-30T13:14:11  <cgoldberg> it can be done with selenium API, not in webdriver (afaik)
2011-08-30T13:16:03  <selbot> New news from builds: WEB-SEHQ-213 was SUCCESSFUL : Updated by luke.semerau@gmail.com <http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/WEB-SEHQ-213>
2011-08-30T13:18:35  <mydog2> hey cgoldberg  - webdriver
2011-08-30T13:19:45  <cgoldberg> mydog2, yea, nothing like that exists.. however the selenium API (still works in selenium2) can expose them via using an its internal proxy
2011-08-30T13:22:26  <cgoldberg> mydog2, so I think the answer is to use the selenium built-in proxy.... or use webdriver with your own proxy

2011-08-30T13:30:57  <mydog2> i also saw some things regarding a urlgetcommand if i recall..
2011-08-30T13:31:21  <mydog2> ie, once i get the page, i could then look at the url used to generate the page..

2011-08-30T14:03:29  <lukeis> well, i think you almost had it..... i don't know if this works, but maybe... //tr/td[@class="CourseTitle"]/../following-sibling::tr/td

2011-08-30T14:04:22  <Ajay_> mydog2: are you doing scraping >

2011-08-30T14:06:52  <mydog2> hey Ajay_  - of course.
2011-08-30T14:07:02  *** ian_mac has quit IRC
2011-08-30T14:07:04  <lukeis> actually.... i would probably tackle it in another way... and just split the whole source by "CourseTitle" and then deal with each split (after trimming the cruft) as individual dom's
2011-08-30T14:08:01  <mydog2> yeah.. but the issue is that the coursetitles are trs.. and the section data are also trs.. and they're all at the same level!
2011-08-30T14:08:21  *** ahal has quit IRC
2011-08-30T14:08:31  <lukeis> yeah, so why wouldn't splitting it work?
2011-08-30T14:08:53  <mydog2> so there's no way you can trigger off of a course, to get the associated sections.. unless you get the siblings and keep going till you hit the next class

2011-08-30T14:11:03  <lukeis> probably how i would do it, yeah.... get all the rows, check if it's a title, otherwise continue as it is the previously discovered title

2011-08-30T14:15:07  <selbot2> 1: GettingInvolved: Easy ways to get involved with the webdriver project - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/GettingInvolved
2011-08-30T14:15:11  <ato> MenSaGeRo: ^---
2011-08-30T14:15:25  <magusOTB> I understand how to query if an object exists, but I don't see how to get anything else out of it? (i.e. whether it is "display: none")
2011-08-30T14:15:42  <magusOTB> I don't want to get involved I want to use it.
2011-08-30T14:15:49  <MenSaGeRo> ato, thanks
2011-08-30T14:16:04  <ato> magusOTB: getAttribute maybe?
2011-08-30T14:16:34  <ato> I suppose that's just .attribute or something in Python, although I don't know Python.
2011-08-30T14:16:50  <ato> MenSaGeRo: Also, hanging around here is a good strategy (-;
2011-08-30T14:17:06  <MenSaGeRo> yes, that's what I plan to do
2011-08-30T14:17:18  <MenSaGeRo> I was just trying to think of an easy task that needs to be done to get used to the code base
2011-08-30T14:17:31  <magusOTB> Is there any actual docs on the python API? I've found the javadoc ones and the ruby ones, but they don't appear to match quite exactly

2011-08-30T14:21:07  <ato> MenSaGeRo: I work on the OperaDriver implementation, but the things I've fixed in Selenium directly have been down to “scratching my own itch”-kind of problems.
2011-08-30T14:21:27  <ato> MenSaGeRo: Fixing your own problems is usually a successful strategy (-:
2011-08-30T14:23:22  <magusOTB> lukeis: If they're not being generated, could I possibly get the source code and generate them? or are they just not there?
2011-08-30T14:23:41  <Ajay_> magusOTB: ofcourse
2011-08-30T14:23:59  <lukeis> magusOTB: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/checkout
2011-08-30T14:24:14  <lukeis> or look in your python package that was installed
2011-08-30T14:27:14  <lukeis> comments don't exist on every method / class... but most do :)
2011-08-30T14:27:34  <magusOTB> Cool. I should be able to get by with that.
2011-08-30T14:29:32  <ato> magusOTB: Just check out the repo, create a diff and have someone review it.  Before you know, you'll have your first patch in (-:
2011-08-30T14:29:33  <cgoldberg> magusOTB, i have them posted.. want linkage?
2011-08-30T14:29:51  <dawagner> Proposal: Docs go under /svn/docs rather than /svn/trunk/docs
2011-08-30T14:30:10  <ato> s/magusOTB/MenSaGeRo, of course.
2011-08-30T14:30:25  <ato> dawagner: I saw the Google style docs were made free software: Yay!
2011-08-30T14:31:10  <MenSaGeRo> ato, many thanks
2011-08-30T14:31:16  <lukeis> dawagner: but then we don't have the natural versioning of the docs
2011-08-30T14:31:22  <lukeis> err, branching
2011-08-30T14:31:22  <MenSaGeRo> I will check out the rep, and try to contribute
2011-08-30T14:31:23  <cgoldberg> magusOTB, i generated these from the python code:  http://goldb.org/sst/selenium2_api_docs/html/
2011-08-30T14:31:36  <cgoldberg> .. or whomever it is that was looking...
2011-08-30T14:31:47  <cgoldberg> .. python API docs
2011-08-30T14:32:40  <lukeis> cgoldberg: no support pacakge? ;)
2011-08-30T14:32:58  <cgoldberg> heh?
2011-08-30T14:33:07  <lukeis> selenium.webdriver.support.ui
2011-08-30T14:33:16  <lukeis> (it's new)
2011-08-30T14:33:17  <dawagner> lukeis: If you want to look at an old release's docs, check out the source and compile them. The overhead of committing and updating the docs every release is, I suspect, a much more common problem than the benefit of having versioned docs that people don't look at
2011-08-30T14:33:28  <cgoldberg> lukeis, is that new?  this might only be up to 2.4.0 or so
2011-08-30T14:33:52  <lukeis> cgoldberg: it was in 2.4 i think
2011-08-30T14:34:01  <cgoldberg> lukeis, i generated them July 26.. should probably re-generate them :)
2011-08-30T14:34:38  <dawagner> lukeis: A happy alternative would be munging the assorted doc formats so that we don't commit changes which are timestamp-only changes; then versioned docs are much more useful :p
2011-08-30T14:34:41  <cgoldberg> next selenium release I'll update the docs
2011-08-30T14:35:25  <lukeis> dawagner: I really think anything generated does not belong in source control at all though :)
2011-08-30T14:37:06  <lukeis> (for example iphone/src/objc/atoms.h )

2011-08-30T15:22:46  <jmathes> at my company we use selenium and selenium 2 both
2011-08-30T15:23:00  <jmathes> we've discovered a best practice that we think should be released with selenium
2011-08-30T15:23:15  <jmathes> we've insrumented all of our client APIs to do it but would like to give back
2011-08-30T15:23:29  <jmathes> basically it's implicitly waiting for everything, not just element presence
2011-08-30T15:24:03  <jmathes> like, if you want clicking on an element to display a dialog
2011-08-30T15:24:37  <jmathes> your API, when told to check whether the dialog is displayed, should spinwait for it to be displayed
2011-08-30T15:24:42  <jmathes> rather than checking once
2011-08-30T15:25:37  <jmathes> without this kind of behavior, selenium tests race the browser and get pretty flakey
2011-08-30T15:27:05  <jmathes> here's an implementation for selenium 2 in python:
2011-08-30T15:27:06  <jmathes> http://codepad.org/ay4nbgrW
2011-08-30T15:28:05  <jmathes> this runs on the client side. I think it would be better for sel server to natively support this kind of spinwaiting, so it doesn't need to be reimplimented in every language's driver
2011-08-30T15:28:29  <jmathes> How do I get permission to contribute code to the project?

2011-08-30T15:42:42  <lukeis> jmathes: you can always contribute to the project... committing to it will take a bit more (time, many patches submitted, essentially a 'sponsor' member of the existing dev team). I would suggest if you think your code has merit, create a :newissue and attach the new code as a patch to the svn code (svn diff), please be sure to include some tests too

2011-08-30T15:43:54  <jmathes> is jason huggins a member of the existing dev team?
2011-08-30T15:44:27  <jmathes> here's a better question (sorry for not knowing this already; I suck at code.google.com): how do I see who the existing dev team is?
2011-08-30T15:44:51  <lukeis> yes, huggins is... http://code.google.com/p/selenium/people/list
2011-08-30T15:45:41  <jmathes> cool.  he'll sponsor me
2011-08-30T15:45:57  <jmathes> thanks for the tips
2011-08-30T15:46:05  <lukeis> but if you're doing things with Python... be sure to talk to David Burns
2011-08-30T15:46:21  <lukeis> he's the dev lead for them
2011-08-30T15:46:24  <jmathes> i want to make changes to the server
2011-08-30T15:46:29  <jmathes> not the python driver
2011-08-30T15:46:32  <jmathes> so it will be java
2011-08-30T15:46:34  <lukeis> ok ;)
2011-08-30T15:47:49  <lukeis> i only saw what you mentioned about python with your patient wait... unless you think that should be in the server code?
2011-08-30T15:47:50  <Ajay__> lukeis: what does the sponsoring mean ?
2011-08-30T15:49:06  <jmathes> yes, I think that should be in the server code
2011-08-30T15:49:53  <jmathes> i think the paradigm of selenium should be wait_for(condition) rather than assert_true(is_it_the_case_that(condition))
2011-08-30T15:50:23  <jmathes> right now we have this rigged to work that way in the client side, which for us is python, meaning our assertions all poll selenium over and over

2011-08-30T18:16:37  <BenGrailsGuy> if webdriver goes to www.yahoo.com which sets cookie yahooId, but then it goes to www.google.com which sets googleId... the yahooId cookie will not be there anymore
2011-08-30T18:16:49  <BenGrailsGuy> is there anyway to make webdriver keep the cookies?
2011-08-30T18:17:15  <BenGrailsGuy> driver.manage().getCookies() only gets the current domain's cookies

2011-08-30T18:26:45  <dawagner> BenGrailsGuy: No... That's how cookies work...
2011-08-30T18:26:57  <dawagner> If it were a.google.com and b.google.com you could set a cookie that would appear on both
2011-08-30T18:27:08  <BenGrailsGuy> no you dont know what i'm asking
2011-08-30T18:27:21  <BenGrailsGuy> selenium webdriver is supposed to get what's on the BROWSER
2011-08-30T18:27:35  <BenGrailsGuy> the cookie is there. the browser has access to it.
2011-08-30T18:27:45  <BenGrailsGuy> so why cant webdriver get the cookie
2011-08-30T18:28:12  <adamgoucher> but not in the context of the page it is at it cant get it
2011-08-30T18:29:19  <BenGrailsGuy> well that is no good.
2011-08-30T18:29:38  <BenGrailsGuy> i thougth webdriver had direct access to the browser
2011-08-30T18:29:51  <BenGrailsGuy> i guess it just uses javascript to get the cookies...
2011-08-30T18:30:09  <adamgoucher> sure; but it does so in a mimic-the-user fashion
2011-08-30T18:30:40  * adamgoucher should note he really doesnt know what he is talking about and to ask eran, simon or jim
2011-08-30T18:34:15  <dawagner> BenGrailsGuy: We can't do so in a cross-browser way, so we don't offer the API
2011-08-30T18:34:41  <dawagner> (This may not actually be true any more, other than for Safari which we don't officially support at all)

2011-08-30T18:35:05  <BenGrailsGuy> !!!
2011-08-30T18:35:19  <BenGrailsGuy> na ill stick to what ive got
2011-08-30T18:35:21  <dawagner> Patches welcome ;)
2011-08-30T18:35:28  <BenGrailsGuy> LOL
2011-08-30T18:35:40  <dawagner> I can point you at where to look in the codebase; it wouldn't be *that* hard to do
2011-08-30T18:35:55  <dawagner> Where we *can* support the functionality, we tend to just filter out the other cookies in a for loop
2011-08-30T18:37:19  <dawagner> (Or, you know, feel free to file a :newissue)
