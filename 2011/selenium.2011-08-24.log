2011-08-24T00:25:47  <texxan> hello, what's the difference between using a server and a driver?
2011-08-24T00:25:52  <texxan> driver connects to server?
2011-08-24T00:30:11  <mashiara> texxan: are you asking the difference between webdriver and seleniumrc ?
2011-08-24T00:30:38  *** freynaud has quit IRC
2011-08-24T00:31:51  <texxan> mashiara, that's right
2011-08-24T00:31:59  <texxan> i am reading the documents and i am a little confused
2011-08-24T00:32:07  <texxan> it says if you are using a web driver, you dont need a server
2011-08-24T00:32:18  <Ajay> yes , you dont need a server
2011-08-24T00:32:20  <texxan> but where does the web driver connects to then?
2011-08-24T00:32:29  <Binken_> your browser
2011-08-24T00:32:48  <Ajay> webdriver interacts with the browser directly with
2011-08-24T00:32:52  <Ajay> native calls
2011-08-24T00:32:53  <texxan> okie, then what's the purpose of having a server then? as compared to a web driver
2011-08-24T00:33:12  <Ajay> Selenium rc was based on the server
2011-08-24T00:33:22  <texxan> is it the same as me connecting to the server and the server calls the browser natively?
2011-08-24T00:33:30  <texxan> except that its being done remotely and not locally
2011-08-24T00:33:44  <texxan> Me -> Server -> Browser
2011-08-24T00:33:51  <texxan> Me -> WebDriver -> Browser
2011-08-24T00:34:05  <texxan> correct me if i am wrong
2011-08-24T00:34:13  <Ajay> u r correct almost
2011-08-24T00:34:48  <Ajay> but the rc was based on injecting Javascript
2011-08-24T00:35:21  <texxan> oh, so WebDriver is the best way to go
2011-08-24T00:35:31  <Ajay> Ofcourse :)
2011-08-24T00:42:42  <texxan> what about with existing firefox window?
2011-08-24T00:42:51  <texxan> or does it load a new one
2011-08-24T00:42:58  <Binken_> load new one
2011-08-24T00:46:59  <texxan> ok, looks like getting this to work in a headless environment is going to be a PITA
2011-08-24T00:50:04  <texxan> oh yeah baby
2011-08-24T00:50:05  <texxan> it works

2011-08-24T01:31:19  <Stuk> Elvanor: yep, here :)
2011-08-24T01:32:26  <Elvanor> my problem yesterday really seems to be a timeout of some sort. I changed the values of 5 timeouts and now I get further in the test
2011-08-24T01:32:51  <Stuk> okay, cool, which timouts did you change?
2011-08-24T01:33:27  <texxan> is there a way to start the firefox internally using private browsing modes?
2011-08-24T01:33:42  <Elvanor> Stuk: http://fpaste.org/S9mH/
2011-08-24T01:33:54  <Elvanor> I have not tried to see which one exactly solve the problem
2011-08-24T01:34:28  <Stuk> okay, OPERA_IDLE won't be the one, as idle needs to be specifically enabled
2011-08-24T01:34:52  <Elvanor> still a PITA though, it only works if I close all the tabs from previous session manually
2011-08-24T01:34:57  <Elvanor> so I have to do that all the time
2011-08-24T01:35:56  <Stuk> it's interesting you don't have a ~/.opera-autotest directory, because deleting that dir would remove all open tabs
2011-08-24T01:36:24  <Stuk> which java could do before each test
2011-08-24T01:39:12  <Elvanor> yeah
2011-08-24T01:39:22  <Elvanor> it seems the settings go into .opera
2011-08-24T01:40:22  <Stuk> which selenium version are you using?
2011-08-24T01:41:05  <Elvanor> 2.4
2011-08-24T01:41:47  <Elvanor> Stuk: ok the timeout which seems to make it work is:
2011-08-24T01:41:53  <Elvanor> com.opera.core.systems.scope.internal.OperaIntervals.DEFAULT_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT.setValue(100000)
2011-08-24T01:41:59  <Elvanor> all the others seem in fact useless

2011-08-24T01:48:19  <Stuk> okay, that's used in a lot of places, so sadly doesn't narrow it down the exact problem
2011-08-24T01:49:52  <Elvanor> hmm okay
2011-08-24T01:50:37  <Elvanor> anyway I think I may have to wait until Opera proper support for multiprofiles until this is really usable

2011-08-24T01:52:16  <Stuk> one thing before you give up :) could you run  lsof -p `pgrep -o opera` | grep .opera  while the test/opera is running, to try and find out what profile directory it's using?

2011-08-24T02:10:03  <Elvanor> which package is it part of?
2011-08-24T02:10:38  <Stuk> oh, I thought it was standard
2011-08-24T02:10:45  <Stuk> um, I'll have a look

2011-08-24T02:11:50  <Elvanor> indeed :)

2011-08-24T02:14:07  <Stuk> thanks, so it is using you standard opera profile... that shouldn't happen
2011-08-24T02:14:19  <Elvanor> yeah that's what I thought
2011-08-24T02:14:35  <Stuk> one more thing then, could run ps aux | grep opera to check that -autotestmode is one of the arguments passed
2011-08-24T02:14:38  *** cburroughs has quit IRC
2011-08-24T02:17:16  <Elvanor> Stuk: even when I run opera -autotestmode from command line, it uses my default profile
2011-08-24T02:17:32  <Elvanor> so I doubt the problem is that the argument is not passed
2011-08-24T02:17:43  <Stuk> Elvanor: wow, okay...
2011-08-24T02:18:57  <Stuk> ahhh, I've just remembered, you said your /usr/bin/opera script had this line: export OPERA_PERSONALDIR=${OPERA_PERSONALDIR:-"${HOME}/.opera"}
2011-08-24T02:19:04  <Elvanor> yes
2011-08-24T02:19:10  <Stuk> mine doesn't, I guess if that's removed it will work
2011-08-24T02:19:54  <Elvanor> indeed
2011-08-24T02:20:05  <Elvanor> if I remove I get the .opera-autotest directory created

2011-08-24T03:07:35  <eranm> FYI, javascript tests in click_test.html are failing because the effect of the events take place *after* asserting, not before. Do you know what changed in the JS execution model between Firefox 4 and 5?
2011-08-24T03:12:20  <jarib> 5 and 6 you mean
2011-08-24T03:13:19  <eranm> test_javascript was passing on Firefox 4 for me, failing on 5 and 6
2011-08-24T03:13:28  <jarib> oh
2011-08-24T03:13:37  <jarib> that's odd.
2011-08-24T03:14:12  <jarib> pretty sure i had click_test working on Firefox 5. i'll check
2011-08-24T03:15:58  <eranm> It could be. There's a timing issue there - we need the equivalent of WebDriverWait for the JS tests. Unfortunately, the best we have is the asyncTestCase

2011-08-24T05:59:46  <catepoblas> It's frustrating, no doubt. I think that the groups platform/mailing list isn't conducive to quality -- people should be encouraged to use the Testing StackExchange site : http://sqa.stackexchange.com/   since there is stricter moderation and focus on quality

2011-08-24T06:01:07  <catepoblas> It has the extra SE functionality like showing related questions as you type your question. In general though, users need to be moderated and guided in some fashion, which is not easy with a mailing list.

2011-08-24T06:36:41  <Strav> Hi. I've just installed selenium ide, the python client driver and selenium grid. Now while I don't seem to have any problem with the client driver, I'm having some trouble getting the grid to work as I need. I've been able to test the demos but further than that, I cannot seem to find relevant documentation. I'm not familiar with the java build process but before I really get involved in it, isn't there just a simple way to generate a
2011-08-24T06:36:41  <Strav> remote control test from the firefox ide and just run multiple instances with the grid? Is there any documentation out there showing how to set a custom grid test?

2011-08-24T06:41:52  <Strav> And no video with the muppets explaining how to setup a grid test? I'm really disappointed here.
2011-08-24T06:42:18  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, adamgoucher, got any experience or anecdotes running multiple parallel versions of native webdriver? (i.e. a local native grid)
2011-08-24T06:42:51  <AutomatedTester> cgoldberg: nativewebdriver as in the Android?
2011-08-24T06:43:10  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, no sorry.. just mean regular webdriver (not remote webdriver)
2011-08-24T06:43:15  <adamgoucher> cgoldberg: there was a thread on se-dev between jarib and paul hammant about port clashes or something with lots of firefoxen on the same machine

2011-08-24T07:43:49  <jarib> cgoldberg: my guess would be that firefox isn't able to bind to the assigned port, since one of the 9 other running firefoxes grabs it for an outgoing connection first (e.g. for firefox->internet connections or py->firefox connections)

2011-08-24T07:50:09  <cgoldberg> jarib gotcha
2011-08-24T07:50:39  <jarib> so i manually manage the assigned ports in the 1024-1280 range, then set sys.net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range to 1280-65535

2011-08-24T08:28:10  <jimevans> if i want to omit it in the resulting xml, that won't work as the add_element call stands, right?
2011-08-24T08:28:55  <jarib> sounds right - if @target_framework is nil rexml will probably set an empty string as the attr
2011-08-24T08:29:23  <jimevans> well, i've not actually tried it, so i don't know, but that sounds like what i would expect.

2011-08-24T10:40:18  <BenGrailsGuy> so then after I have xnvc, I have to view the machine's GUI remotely and install firefox via the GUI, i'm assuming. correct?
2011-08-24T10:41:27  <lukeis> not really, you can install it command line and just have it on the system path... when you start your test you need to specify the display for it to run on

2011-08-24T11:22:25  <BenGrailsGuy> if I have an ubuntu server on which I run selenium webdriver, does that mean i can't use webdriver with IE?
2011-08-24T11:23:23  <kennethkoontz> BenGrailsGuy, I think you would need to use selenium remote to accomplish that.
2011-08-24T11:23:31  <kennethkoontz> Perhaps in a vm on your ubuntu server.

2011-08-24T11:37:06  <cgoldberg> kennethkoontz, perfect.. it's sorta ubuntu-centric (at least the docs are.. it runs anywhere though)

2011-08-24T11:37:41  <cgoldberg> kennethkoontz, SST is built on webdriver.. (and optionally can use remote webdriver)

2011-08-24T11:37:53  <kennethkoontz> Yes, it works great.
2011-08-24T11:38:56  <cgoldberg> kennethkoontz, got a link to trial?  (super vague term to google :)
2011-08-24T11:39:19  <kennethkoontz> Sure, it's twisted's trial.

2011-08-24T11:39:57  <cgoldberg> kennethkoontz, ah.. so that's more of a runner than a framework, eh?
2011-08-24T11:40:29  <cgoldberg> kennethkoontz, are you just writing raw selenium/webdriver code inside?
2011-08-24T11:40:31  <kennethkoontz> Not sure of the actual terminology:) Just know that its a unittest framework.
2011-08-24T11:40:38  *** cornelinux has quit IRC
2011-08-24T11:40:46  <kennethkoontz> Yes.
2011-08-24T11:41:11  <cgoldberg> kennethkoontz, understandable... unittest itself is a framework.. which contains runners
2011-08-24T11:41:28  <cgoldberg> so this looks like a runner that builds on unittest
2011-08-24T11:41:59  <cgoldberg> kennethkoontz, this is interesting... i like some of the options
2011-08-24T11:42:19  <cgoldberg> kennethkoontz, so SST is a higher level framework.  you don't write webdriver code directly
2011-08-24T11:42:22  <kennethkoontz> Yeah. I think the reason why twisted created this is because of the ability to test deferred objects as twisted's whole idea is async programming.
2011-08-24T11:42:30  <cgoldberg> you use a set of Pythyon functions we provide

2011-08-24T13:41:41  <AutomatedTester> danielwh: re:lint, can you use PEP8 as that is the standard
2011-08-24T13:42:20  <AutomatedTester> I dont want to use a company tool when there is a language standard

2011-08-24T13:43:03  <danielwh> AutomatedTester: I've been sticking to http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html which is either PEP8 or very very nearly PEP8
2011-08-24T13:43:14  <AutomatedTester> ok cool
2011-08-24T13:43:19  <danielwh> Are there places I've made changes against PEP8?
2011-08-24T13:43:50  <AutomatedTester> no but since you were saying Lint, I thought you might have some special linting tool
2011-08-24T13:44:00  <danielwh> Ok cool :)
2011-08-24T13:44:17  <jarib> danielwh: don't worry, they should learn to use local branches anyway
2011-08-24T13:44:25  <jimevans> danielwh: are you going to be looking at .net code too?
2011-08-24T13:44:29  <jarib> oh right, we're not using a DVCS with cheap local branches
2011-08-24T13:44:33  <jarib> forgot about that.

2011-08-24T13:47:59  <ruel> is there an updated changelog for 2.5.0?
2011-08-24T13:48:04  <danielwh> ato yes, I've just *found* the canonical  IntelliJ formatting file, and I've put together an Eclipse one, we'll open source them shortly :)
2011-08-24T13:48:10  <adamgoucher> i thought release bacon was an adjective not a nou
2011-08-24T13:48:13  <ruel> the link on the main page is showing 2.4.0 as the version in the changelog

2011-08-24T13:56:29  <imanc> is it possible to build tests using selenium with the browser plugin, then import them into python?
2011-08-24T13:57:15  <adamgoucher> yes, though the real recommendation is ignore the browser plugin entirely and make use of things like the page object pattern for script design

2011-08-24T14:01:28  <cgoldberg> BenGrailsGuy, still struggling with webdriver on Ubuntu?
2011-08-24T14:01:35  <cgoldberg> i have a few mins
2011-08-24T14:01:59  <BenGrailsGuy> cgoldberg: of course i am :).. but moving along slowly
2011-08-24T14:02:09  <AutomatedTester> lukeis: i have found a bug in your code...
2011-08-24T14:02:10  <selbot> New news from builds: WEB-ADDON-17 was SUCCESSFUL : Updated by adam_goucher@hotmail.com <http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/WEB-ADDON-17>
2011-08-24T14:02:12  <lukeis> BenGrailsGuy: my understanding is that is a preference to set  profile.setPreference(FirefoxProfile.PORT_PREFERENCE, port)
2011-08-24T14:02:24  <cgoldberg> BenGrailsGuy, something specific I can help with?  what are you trying to do?
2011-08-24T14:02:30  <lukeis> AutomatedTester: do share :)

2011-08-24T14:03:19  <lukeis> nice
2011-08-24T14:03:29  <BenGrailsGuy> cgoldberg: I'm trying to use hudson to start my webapp, which runs a selenium phase with webdriver test type, which will open a firefox webdriver. but the problem is firefox webdriver cant connect on 7055
2011-08-24T14:03:30  <lukeis> ok
2011-08-24T14:03:45  <lukeis> easy fix ;)
2011-08-24T14:03:51  <BenGrailsGuy> the cause of which, i am still trying to determine.
2011-08-24T14:04:14  <lukeis> but i don't have a test case around that... suppose i should do that too...
2011-08-24T14:04:28  <cgoldberg> BenGrailsGuy, why can't it use standard port?
2011-08-24T14:05:13  <rex_hoffman> BenGrailsGuy, do you have a few other tests running on that server at the same time occupying that port?
2011-08-24T14:05:27  <BenGrailsGuy> cgoldberg: i don't know ;). that is the question
2011-08-24T14:05:46  <cgoldberg> BenGrailsGuy, is this remote webdriver.. or just local?
2011-08-24T14:05:50  <BenGrailsGuy> rex_hoffman: nope. as far as I know, this is a brand new server
2011-08-24T14:06:04  <BenGrailsGuy> cgoldberg: this is just local, for now...
2011-08-24T14:06:21  <jarib> BenGrailsGuy: usually in that case it's because firefox doesn't have a DISPLAY set
2011-08-24T14:06:25  <rex_hoffman> creating a firefox instance takes a little while for it to come up. so if you're trying to spawn several at the same time you can see this exception
2011-08-24T14:06:42  <BenGrailsGuy> jarib: i've set display to 7, which is the display i run xvfb on
2011-08-24T14:06:51  <rex_hoffman> might happen if your using testng or some other naturally multithreaded test tool
2011-08-24T14:07:11  <jarib> rex_hoffman: in most languages there's a lock preventing that from being an issue (e.g. would throw a different error)
2011-08-24T14:07:16  <jarib> including ava
2011-08-24T14:07:18  <jarib> *java
2011-08-24T14:07:39  <jarib> BenGrailsGuy: perhaps it needs to be :7
2011-08-24T14:07:46  <jarib> that colon can be important
2011-08-24T14:07:47  <rex_hoffman> ahh, I recall having seen in quite a bit when I set up my servers a while back
2011-08-24T14:08:14  <lukeis> AutomatedTester: hows that rake target coming along for running one python test :-D
2011-08-24T14:08:20  <jarib> rex_hoffman: how did you solve it?
2011-08-24T14:08:57  <BenGrailsGuy> jarib: thats what it is :)
2011-08-24T14:09:02  <BenGrailsGuy> jarib: i meant :7, not 7
2011-08-24T14:09:03  <rex_hoffman> wrote some multithread code to pool the instances…. this was before there was hub code
2011-08-24T14:09:22  <BenGrailsGuy> jarib: come to think of it, maybe it really does need to be just "7" not ":7"... :O
2011-08-24T14:09:39  <rex_hoffman> looking into hub soon
2011-08-24T14:09:50  <jarib> rex_hoffman: so you're launching one by one up front?
2011-08-24T14:09:58  <rex_hoffman> wanted to write an automated browser installer first
2011-08-24T14:10:13  <rex_hoffman> yeah, still have that code laying about
2011-08-24T14:10:14  <lukeis> rex_hoffman - by hub you mean grid ;)
2011-08-24T14:10:18  <rex_hoffman> ahh
2011-08-24T14:10:20  <rex_hoffman> indeed
2011-08-24T14:10:32  <cgoldberg> rex_hoffman, interesting.. i'm working on multi-threaded test runner using webdriver today actually.. would love hear about pitfalls
2011-08-24T14:10:39  <AutomatedTester> lukeis: been kinda busy releasing 2.5
2011-08-24T14:10:46  <rex_hoffman> you can grab my code from github
2011-08-24T14:10:49  <rex_hoffman> it works
2011-08-24T14:10:55  <cgoldberg> rex_hoffman, what language?
2011-08-24T14:10:57  <rex_hoffman> used it as symantec

2011-08-24T14:13:06  <cgoldberg> BenGrailsGuy, yea.. but i ran into some initial probs in my proof of concept.  technically it's multi-processed, not multi-threaded, but yea
2011-08-24T14:13:07  <rex_hoffman> selenium is just one of the "modules" it can run with
2011-08-24T14:13:52  <rex_hoffman> it's an extension to testng so there is some ugliness in some of the code
2011-08-24T14:14:23  <BenGrailsGuy> cgoldberg: I've been trying to figure out how to make my webapp run maybe 3 threads of test at a time. so far i've got a driver pool.. but i havent looked into it much. i've got hudson stuff to worry about
2011-08-24T14:14:26  <rex_hoffman> I make heavy use of thread locals, pooling, thread spawning and futures
2011-08-24T14:14:26  <cgoldberg> rex_hoffman, everything ran smooth with my proof of concept with 5 parallel browsers... my full suite with 10 drivers eventually fails
2011-08-24T14:14:39  <rex_hoffman> timeout
2011-08-24T14:14:44  *** jimevans has left #selenium
2011-08-24T14:15:23  <rex_hoffman> if you have too many instances being spawned at once, the firefox driver at least fails if it's not available in 45 seconds or so

2011-08-24T14:16:16  <rex_hoffman> yeah unless it's a damn  beefy machine some of 'em won't respond in time
2011-08-24T14:16:29  <cgoldberg> rex_hoffman,  i can certainly stagger the start.. but the prob it, each test case does a setUp/tearDown the opens/close the browser
2011-08-24T14:16:42  <rex_hoffman> I don't do that
2011-08-24T14:16:45  <cgoldberg> damn can't type today
2011-08-24T14:17:10  <rex_hoffman> I have an activate and passivate method when the object is being taken and returned to the pool
2011-08-24T14:17:22  <rex_hoffman> so I don't actually shutdown the browser
2011-08-24T14:17:33  <cgoldberg> rex_hoffman, yea mine has no pooling

2011-08-24T14:17:47  <cgoldberg> rex_hoffman,  how many browsers in your pool can run reliably?
2011-08-24T14:17:49  <rex_hoffman> the tester is responsible for logging out if they need to
2011-08-24T14:18:03  <BenGrailsGuy> cgoldberg: i ran into the same problem! each method opens/closes
2011-08-24T14:18:09  <rex_hoffman> I've had 5 going, but not on all of my devs desktops
2011-08-24T14:18:14  <rex_hoffman> or laptops
2011-08-24T14:18:19  <rex_hoffman> so I kept it to 3
2011-08-24T14:18:34  <rex_hoffman> but the real gain is not having to start a browser every time
2011-08-24T14:18:40  <cgoldberg> BenGrailsGuy, are you regularly on this channel? :)  i have to leave soon, but would love to chat tomorrow and show you what i've done
2011-08-24T14:18:54  <rex_hoffman> be retaining browser between tests runs you save sooo much time

2011-08-24T14:20:00  <rex_hoffman> it is worth it
2011-08-24T14:20:30  <rex_hoffman> I wouldn't even make it a real option, force it and make the dev clean up the browser state if they have to
2011-08-24T14:20:38  <rex_hoffman> just give them a good hook

2011-08-24T14:27:29  <rex_hoffman> that is
2011-08-24T14:27:43  <BenGrailsGuy> OK firefox driver officially does not connect on ANY port
2011-08-24T14:27:57  <BenGrailsGuy> i made my pool try to connect to several different ports if default connect didnt work
2011-08-24T14:28:22  <cgoldberg> rex_hoffman, cool..Python is my go-to language.. thinking about learning so Go as a side project
2011-08-24T14:28:24  <lukeis> BenGrailsGuy: what version of FF what version of webdriver what OS?
2011-08-24T14:29:41  <jarib> BenGrailsGuy: can you launch firefox from the command line manually?
2011-08-24T14:30:13  <BenGrailsGuy> jarib: the guy who admins the server said yes he can start is manually
2011-08-24T14:30:29  <BenGrailsGuy> (i dont like having to work with a server admin :/)
2011-08-24T14:30:45  <jarib> well, that's a problem right there :)
2011-08-24T14:30:55  <BenGrailsGuy> LOL
2011-08-24T14:31:03  <jarib> does firefox open at all when webdriver times out?
2011-08-24T14:31:57  <BenGrailsGuy> jarib: i don't know. the server doesnt have a monitor.. i set the display to :7, which is xvfb's display, so it should run, but...
2011-08-24T14:32:17  <BenGrailsGuy> is there some way to tell if firefox opens?
2011-08-24T14:32:23  <BenGrailsGuy> maybe it cant find the binary....
2011-08-24T14:32:44  <BenGrailsGuy> but if that were the case i should get an error when creating the FirefoxBinary object
2011-08-24T14:32:47  <BenGrailsGuy> right?
2011-08-24T14:33:01  <jarib> you'd get a different error
2011-08-24T14:33:24  <jarib> if he installed xvnc like you said, you can connect to the display remotely
2011-08-24T14:33:31  <cgoldberg> BenGrailsGuy, I use pyvirtualdisplay for this stuff in python
2011-08-24T14:33:49  <jarib> or you can examine the process list to see if firefox is running
2011-08-24T14:34:14  <BenGrailsGuy> like "ps -e | grep firefox"?
2011-08-24T14:34:22  <jarib> yep
2011-08-24T14:34:29  <BenGrailsGuy> kk
2011-08-24T14:34:40  <BenGrailsGuy> ima try and see if i can spot firefox runnning
2011-08-24T14:35:08  <jarib> what language are you using?
2011-08-24T14:35:34  <BenGrailsGuy> jarib: java, groovy, with the grails framework
2011-08-24T14:36:09  <jarib> try setting webdriver.firefox.logfile=/dev/stdout as a system property to see the output from firefox
2011-08-24T14:37:26  <BenGrailsGuy> kk let me try to set up logs and re-run

2011-08-24T14:43:06  <BenGrailsGuy> or at least the process starts
2011-08-24T14:44:21  <jarib> how about `ps -e | grep vnc`

2011-08-24T15:17:01  <Strav> if anyone asks about firefox launching a blank page in selenium grid, the answer really is the browser version. Remplacing the symlink in /usr/bin/ with another executable is not sufficient though, you gotta replace your whole firefox with preferably version 3.6.
2011-08-24T15:17:10  <BenGrailsGuy> which is really strange... why is it mentioning chrome at all???
2011-08-24T15:17:12  <danielwh> It's extra latency, which is annoying, but it helps keep the tests nice and isolated :)

2011-08-24T15:49:23  <BenGrailsGuy> ^^ that bastard
2011-08-24T15:50:51  <jarib> so you have no log output, not from setting the the "webdriver.log.file" profile preference OR setting the "webdriver.firefox.logfile" system property?
2011-08-24T15:51:28  <jarib> are you sure you're setting the last one right? you clearly have output from firefox (the gtk warnings)
2011-08-24T15:52:09  <jarib> if the system property is set correctly, that output will end up there

2011-08-24T16:45:45  <jarib_> i see we've had it before, but that was on freebsd and was solved by adding it as a supported platform

2011-08-24T16:46:16  <BenGrailsGuy> hmm.
2011-08-24T16:46:31  <BenGrailsGuy> i guess ill try downgrading ff
2011-08-24T16:46:33  <BenGrailsGuy> who knows...
2011-08-24T16:46:38  <jarib_> it's odd that you don't see more addon messages when launching firefox manually though
2011-08-24T16:46:58  <jarib_> almost like webdriver is using a different firefox install..
2011-08-24T16:47:21  <BenGrailsGuy> im going to download ff5, and make webdriver use the binary explicityly
2011-08-24T16:47:29  <BenGrailsGuy> so theres no possibl confusion
2011-08-24T16:47:37  <jarib_> yep
2011-08-24T16:47:59  <jarib_> or just try pointing webdriver at the one you get in the shell
2011-08-24T16:48:05  *** ruel has left #selenium
2011-08-24T16:48:06  <jarib_> i.e. which firefox
2011-08-24T16:48:06  <BenGrailsGuy> i point it to the directory the binary is in, or the binary itself?
2011-08-24T16:48:14  <jarib_> the binary itself
2011-08-24T16:48:53  <BenGrailsGuy> hmmm
