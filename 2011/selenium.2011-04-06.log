2011-04-06T04:03:47  <rycrostud> Hi guys.  My first time here.  Please be gentle ;p
2011-04-06T04:05:14  <rycrostud> I am using PHPUnit_Selenium and every time I try to use any assert* method ina test case it causes the Selenium server to bomb with "ERROR Server Exception: sessionId should not be null; has this session been started yet?"  Any ideas?  I'm stuck :-(
2011-04-06T04:06:46  <amitev> google for it?
2011-04-06T04:06:47  <selbot> http://www.takeourword.com/
2011-04-06T04:07:18  <rycrostud> I have Googled, Googled and just to be sure... Googled again.  No joy.
2011-04-06T04:08:55  <rycrostud> Some have suggested setAutoStop(false) but the latest stable release of PHPUnit_Selenium is missing this method.
2011-04-06T04:16:24  <HolyGoat> I'm writing some code to glue together Selenium/Nagios (much further than the available nagios plugin). Would you recommend to base my implementation on Selenium RC or on the WebDriver API?
2011-04-06T04:16:31  <HolyGoat> I'm writing it in Python, btw.

2011-04-06T04:34:44  <cgz> hello
2011-04-06T04:36:03  <cgz> is there a way to extend selenium with an selfdefined preproccessor wich is executed before any command?
2011-04-06T04:39:10  <HolyGoat> cgz: are you using selenium rc or do you mean in the selenium server itself?
2011-04-06T04:42:14  <cgz> i need this in bose. i'm trying to be compatible to the selenium ide all the time, so i can't simply use java or so.
2011-04-06T04:42:45  *** nitin_ has quit IRC
2011-04-06T04:42:59  <cgz> is there an method to override in the selenium-object i can extend in the user-extensions
2011-04-06T04:47:03  <HolyGoat> well I faced the same problem but I was using the python driver for rc, in which I just subclassed the driver, wrote a method interceptor and wrapped the methods I was interested in with my own new method
2011-04-06T04:47:39  <HolyGoat> as far as extending the selenium server goes, I'm sure it's possible, but never really looked into it

2011-04-06T04:52:35  <cgz> i can write a modified version of every command i need, but thats not what i want. i need something more generic.

2011-04-06T11:17:10  <jarib> amitev: sounds like you're moving into testing how the browser handles window.print() instead of the actual webapp
2011-04-06T11:17:16  <antlong> AutomatedTester, at the least couldnt sendkeys could just send a keypress without specifying an element locator
2011-04-06T11:17:28  <jarib> i would just check that window.print is called (perhaps in a JS unit test)
2011-04-06T11:17:45  <antlong> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/webdriver/QiywRJyrQoU
2011-04-06T11:18:08  <AutomatedTester> amitev: Selenium works within the renderable area of the browser, the keystrokes could do it but since the print dialog is a modal dialog in the browser chrome
2011-04-06T11:18:19  <amitev> jarib: i want to test print functionality (using printer simulator)
2011-04-06T11:18:20  <AutomatedTester> selenium doesnt really work at the browser chrome level
2011-04-06T11:18:37  <jarib> amitev: you want to test firefox?

2011-04-06T11:18:49  <antlong> amitev, its not possible, just move on to another test
2011-04-06T11:18:57  <amitev> it's java applet that causes this window to open
2011-04-06T11:19:08  <antlong> what language are you writing your tests in
2011-04-06T11:19:11  <amitev> java
2011-04-06T11:19:12  <jarib> ah, that's an important detail

2011-04-06T11:19:44  <jarib> so you would probably want to look at doing this outside selenium; java.awt.Robot
2011-04-06T11:19:51  <jarib> right
2011-04-06T11:20:19  <amitev> yes
2011-04-06T11:20:24  <amitev> i have a code for this
2011-04-06T11:20:31  <antlong> so whats the problem
2011-04-06T11:20:36  <amitev> but selenium stucks so my code doesn't get executed
2011-04-06T11:21:03  <amitev> when the print window gets opened
2011-04-06T11:21:07  <antlong> amitev, try to focus on the window after you run your keypresses
2011-04-06T11:21:28  <amitev> driver.switchTo() ?
2011-04-06T11:21:47  <antlong> give it a shot
2011-04-06T11:22:08  <amitev> thx
2011-04-06T11:22:09  <amitev> i'll try
2011-04-06T11:22:30  <jarib> amitev: you may need to use the Robot class in a separate thread
2011-04-06T11:22:57  <amitev> i do it already
2011-04-06T11:23:14  <jarib> and you're able to successfully close the print dialog window?
2011-04-06T11:23:25  <amitev> yes
2011-04-06T11:23:33  <antlong> jarib, if it just hangs it would indicate a problem in the method hes using, otherwise it would run the next piece of webdriver code and throw an exception after the implicit wait was reached, no?

2011-04-06T13:45:59  <jarib> yeah, /shutdown
2011-04-06T13:46:18  <jarib> i do then poll for it to die and force it if it doesn't

2011-04-06T14:02:59  <jleyba> ...thought I removed that

2011-04-06T14:08:52  *** santiycr has joined #selenium
2011-04-06T14:13:19  <jarib> hmm, that's a new challenge with the server executable; if i want to leave the browser running after a test (to see where it failed), you'll leave the server running
2011-04-06T14:13:27  <jarib> with firefox this works ok since there's just one process
2011-04-06T14:14:06  <jarib> and it dies when you manually close the browser
2011-04-06T14:14:17  <jarib> which isn't the case with the chrome driver
2011-04-06T14:15:17  *** Rajan has quit IRC
2011-04-06T14:16:42  <antlong> jarib, is that by firefox's design?
2011-04-06T14:19:02  <jarib> well, the firefox driver design
2011-04-06T14:19:40  <jarib> with firefox it's: client -> http server (running inside the firefox extensions)
2011-04-06T14:19:54  <antlong> right
2011-04-06T14:20:08  <jarib> with chrome it's client -> http server (chromedriver process) -> browser
2011-04-06T14:20:12  <jarib> so an extra process in between
2011-04-06T14:20:34  <antlong> when you close the browser under that circumstance, what happens to the process id?
2011-04-06T14:20:35  <jarib> if you kill the chromedriver process, it will clean up any running browsers as well
2011-04-06T14:21:40  <jarib> if you quit the browser, i guess the chromedriver server just acts as if it lost the session
2011-04-06T14:22:08  <antlong> jarib, does it make sense to poll the pid of the chrome process to see if its still open?
2011-04-06T14:30:44  *** jqp has quit IRC
2011-04-06T14:33:12  <jarib> antlong: not really
2011-04-06T14:33:36  <jarib> a. we don't really know the pid in the language bindings (since it's handled by the chrome server)
2011-04-06T14:34:22  <jarib> b. the use case is when you leave the browser running after the actual test process has finished
2011-04-06T14:34:33  <jarib> so even if we new the pid, we ourselves would be dead at that point
2011-04-06T14:34:50  <jarib> obviously i mean "we" as in "the client proess" ;)
2011-04-06T14:36:28  <jleyba> To leave Firefox running, you just don't call quit()...why not do the same thing and leave the chromedriver server running?
2011-04-06T14:36:59  <antlong> jleyba, i derived from that jarib said, that it would cause a problem to leave the server open (in that case)
2011-04-06T14:37:38  <antlong> jleyba, ie, you dont call quit, then close chrome, then you get an exception when you go back to webdriver (or you have to kill your interpreter process)
2011-04-06T14:38:54  <jarib> not exactly what i meant
2011-04-06T14:39:25  <jarib> jleyba: it's just the user experience is better with firefox since everything is gone when you quit the browser manually
2011-04-06T14:39:44  <jleyba> Oh
2011-04-06T14:39:47  <jarib> with the chromedriver the users will need to know that a server actually exists
2011-04-06T14:39:56  <jarib> and that they'll have to kill that
2011-04-06T14:40:29  <antlong> jarib, or you just have chrome store the pid in a temp file, and kill that (assuming we have control over that)
2011-04-06T14:40:41  <jleyba> Well..building the server into chrome isn't going to happen, but we can work on the orphan process issue
2011-04-06T14:41:07  <jarib> right
2011-04-06T14:41:45  <jarib> two solutions come to mind
2011-04-06T14:41:59  <jarib> uhm
2011-04-06T14:42:00  <jarib> no
2011-04-06T14:42:02  * jarib thinks
2011-04-06T14:42:07  <antlong> one thing i could see, is using the location of the temp folder as a ps filter
2011-04-06T14:42:30  <antlong> thats a unique identifier of the process that could be used to interact with the process
2011-04-06T14:42:44  *** scrummy has quit IRC
2011-04-06T14:42:53  <antlong> (by temp folder i mean the dir attached to --load-extension)
2011-04-06T14:43:12  <jleyba> just so i understand, the issue is you want to leave the browser running if the server is killed?
2011-04-06T14:43:21  <jarib> hmm
2011-04-06T14:43:23  <jarib> no
2011-04-06T14:43:26  <jleyba> so the server dies with the jvm, but the browser is left open?
2011-04-06T14:43:35  <antlong> jleyba, youd want to kill the server should the browser be closed manually
2011-04-06T14:44:07  <antlong> trigger the equivalent of what would have happened, had you actually performed quit()
2011-04-06T14:44:27  <jleyba> killing the server with the /shutdown url?
2011-04-06T14:44:38  <antlong> yeah, to ensure the proper cleanup took place

2011-04-06T14:44:57  *** adamgoucher has joined #selenium
2011-04-06T14:45:01  <antlong> or just perform the appropriate cleanup functionality outside of /shutdown
2011-04-06T14:45:13  <jarib> i think we're talking around each other
2011-04-06T14:45:22  <jleyba> Yeah, /shutdown kills all sessions.  It's like a super quit()
2011-04-06T14:45:45  <jarib> jleyba: it doesn't make sense to leave any browsers running after quit()
2011-04-06T14:45:55  <jarib> the use case is when i don't call quit, and the test process exits
2011-04-06T14:46:09  <jarib> i may want to inspect the page that failed
2011-04-06T14:46:40  <antlong> jarib, is the server managing more than one session?
2011-04-06T14:46:49  <jleyba> "it doesn't make sense to leave any browsers running after quit()" - quit is directed at an individual session
2011-04-06T14:46:56  <jarib> well, yes

2011-04-06T14:47:19  <jarib> sorry, a lot of stuff going on around here, hard to explain :)
2011-04-06T14:48:05  <jarib> so what we do with firefox, if we want to inspect the page, is just don't call quit()
2011-04-06T14:48:18  <jarib> then we finish investigating, and quit the browser manually
2011-04-06T14:48:37  <jarib> if i were to do that with the chromedriver, the server process would still be running
2011-04-06T14:48:42  <jleyba> since the server is embedded in firefox, quit() behaves like /shutdown
2011-04-06T14:48:45  <jarib> right
2011-04-06T14:48:51  <antlong> well
2011-04-06T14:48:55  <antlong> now that i think about it
2011-04-06T14:48:56  <jarib> so
2011-04-06T14:48:58  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-04-06T14:49:28  <antlong> does it make sense to keep that functionality (what firefox currently does) if we intend on allowing people to attach to already open browser instances
2011-04-06T14:49:29  <jarib> the only solution i can see that would make it work mostly like firefox is
2011-04-06T14:49:53  <antlong> i dont particularly see the usefulness in this anymore
2011-04-06T14:49:55  <jleyba> antlong: attaching to already open browser instances will not happen for chrome
2011-04-06T14:49:57  <jarib> when the JVM exits, send a command to the chrome server to let it know that we're gone
2011-04-06T14:50:16  <antlong> makes more sense to just have a timeout, where if theres no open process for x amount of minutes, we kill the server automatically
2011-04-06T14:50:19  <jleyba> the chromedriver must start the browser for the automation hooks to be enabled
2011-04-06T14:50:28  <jarib> if the session count at that point is 1, the chrome server will shut itself down if that browser is closed manually
2011-04-06T14:50:48  <jleyba> hmm
2011-04-06T14:50:54  <jarib> it's not very elegant, but that's the only way i can think of to get the same user experience as Fx
2011-04-06T14:51:32  <antlong> via something like posting to /shutdown/
2011-04-06T14:51:33  <antlong> ?
2011-04-06T14:51:54  <jleyba> what if someone wants to use chromedriver as a standalone server (like the selenium server jar we distribute)?
2011-04-06T14:52:02  <antlong> isnt the cleanup of files and such handled by the driver though, youd still need to trigger that functionality
2011-04-06T14:52:09  <jleyba> in that case, it makes sense for the server to sit idle when there are no sessions
2011-04-06T14:52:20  <antlong> jleyba, right, for some definitive amount of time
2011-04-06T14:52:22  <jarib> jleyba: then they should always call quit()
2011-04-06T14:52:34  <jarib> perhaps this could be enabled through a flag
2011-04-06T14:52:45  <antlong> jarib, might be hard to train people away from just clicking the x
2011-04-06T14:52:54  <jarib> antlong: that's my point :)
2011-04-06T14:53:29  <antlong> jarib, id probably just vote for if session_count > 1 and there_hasnt_been_action_for(5_minutes): shutdown()
2011-04-06T14:53:30  <jarib> oh right, i'm assuming they won't want to run the server as a standalone server on their local machine
2011-04-06T14:53:43  <antlong> sorry > should be <
2011-04-06T14:53:53  <jarib> makes things complicated
2011-04-06T14:54:06  <antlong> whats the added benefit of doing that?
2011-04-06T14:54:10  <antlong> (running it standalone)
2011-04-06T14:54:41  <jarib> i guess speed, multiple sessions against the same server instance
2011-04-06T14:54:53  <jarib> saving resources
2011-04-06T14:55:41  <jarib> jleyba: an alternative would be to run the server in the client process (which is what the IE driver does)
2011-04-06T14:55:57  <antlong> chrome is sandboxed though, which i would think would handle that well enough
2011-04-06T14:55:58  <jarib> build a .so and expose some native functions to start/stop

2011-04-06T14:57:30  <jleyba> planning on it at this point
2011-04-06T14:58:09  <jleyba> So you want the ability to leave a browser running if the server is killed?
2011-04-06T14:58:30  <jarib> actually.. that may do the trick
2011-04-06T14:58:40  *** Rajan has joined #selenium
2011-04-06T14:59:09  <jarib> i'm just not able to think clearly at the moment with lightning talks in the same room :)
2011-04-06T14:59:37  <antlong> heh, i thought we were figuring out the inverse of that
2011-04-06T15:00:29  <jleyba> antlong: kill the server if no sessions remain?
2011-04-06T15:00:36  <antlong> jleyba bingo
2011-04-06T15:01:02  <jleyba> we can easily add an option for that
2011-04-06T15:01:30  <jleyba> and have java/whatever spawn the server with the option enabled
2011-04-06T15:02:04  <antlong> its been a long day, i thought that was the topic this whole time haha
2011-04-06T15:02:19  <jarib> that's what i suggested yes
2011-04-06T15:02:25  <jleyba> --auto-shutdown=#
2011-04-06T15:02:31  *** Rajan has quit IRC
2011-04-06T15:02:32  <antlong> yeah, for me its more beneficial just to have the logic of freeing the resources and cleaning up if theres no sessions (and some small amount of time has passed)
2011-04-06T15:02:43  <jleyba> Kills the server if no sessions active after # ms
2011-04-06T15:02:53  *** santiycr has quit IRC
2011-04-06T15:02:54  <antlong> yeah exactly
2011-04-06T15:03:15  <antlong> for which we could use the extension dir location as an ID for the process id
2011-04-06T15:03:28  <antlong> should that be easier than adding the logic of storing the pid at runtime
