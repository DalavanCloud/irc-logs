2011-08-26T00:19:50  <djonsson> Hi, I am setting up automated tests for this website that has its login functionality hosted by an external company. When I try to automate a test with Selenium RC I get an SLL error (and am unable to accept the certificate). The same test works in Selenium IDE. I know there are some workarounds out there settting up firefoxproxy +custom profiles that have accepted the certifice, but we want
2011-08-26T00:19:50  <djonsson> to avoid this solution because we lose browser compatibility. We do have a test database for the login functionality, do you think it would work to move this test database to an unsecure environment, remove the SSL certificate to enable the browser to interact with it, or am I missing something here?
2011-08-26T00:22:15  <Ajay> djonnsson: Are you using only the IDE
2011-08-26T00:22:28  <Ajay> output as your test cases
2011-08-26T00:22:54  <djonsson> no, the thing is, when I run my test case in IDE it works and I am able to connect to the login server
2011-08-26T00:23:06  <djonsson> but as soon as Selenium RC is started I am no longer able to login
2011-08-26T00:23:06  <Ajay> -trustAllSslCertificates while you start your server would help
2011-08-26T00:23:44  <djonsson> I am starting the server with -trustAllSslCertificates
2011-08-26T00:24:10  <djonsson> java -jar C:\SELENIUM\Server\selenium-server-standalone-2.4.0.jar -trustALLSSLCertificates
2011-08-26T00:25:37  <djonsson> as soon as the server is running, I get (Error code: ssl_error_internal_error_alert) whenever I try to manually start a browser and try to login to facebook or gmail

2011-08-26T01:27:11  <djonsson> So I have this site that have the login functionality placed on a HTTPS site. All my browsers fail to login except googlechrome that just sails in. Googling a bit showed me that there are loads of workaround to get around the problem for various browsers, but they all seem like hacks to me. Wouldn't the easiest way to fix the problem be to move the login functionality from HTTPS to HTTP in
2011-08-26T01:27:11  <djonsson> the test environment, thus fixing the problem for all browsers?
2011-08-26T01:27:37  <djonsson> would it work?
2011-08-26T01:28:05  <__mike> changing the software so tests run easier? :P do what is best for the users
2011-08-26T01:28:55  <djonsson> well, there is really no point in sending secure data in the test environment since no sensitive data is stored there anyway
2011-08-26T01:30:25  <__mike> i don't wanna tell you what to do but i stand by the point i made earlier. if it happens changing that is better for users and better for testing too then you hit 2 birds with 1 stone ;)
2011-08-26T01:40:43  <djonsson> well, that is true if you have the bandwith to maintain the tests. but as I see it, there is no real drawback of unsecuring the login function in the test environment.

2011-08-26T02:33:01  <__mike> I'm working on bringing a patch out
2011-08-26T02:33:20  <__mike> And then we'll see if it can be integrated with the project
2011-08-26T02:36:19  <Elvanor> __mike: while waiting for your patch, any workaround?
2011-08-26T02:38:16  <__mike> Not that I'm aware of unless you're willing to program a solution similar to mine. I'll try to get a patch pushed out in the next few days. I didn't realise that Simon had replied to that issue
2011-08-26T02:39:11  <__mike> I'll also try pushing some buttons in legal and compliance and see if it's possible for me to get the compiled JAR we have right now pushed out too so people can use it before it's integrated into the project itself.
2011-08-26T02:40:59  <__mike> The fix I have is only for Windows and I only did it for Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. It also works by getting WebDriver to sort of outsource the resizing to our own program. So I would expect full integration with the project might take some time which is why I'll try to get the JAR we have pushed out too
2011-08-26T02:48:17  <Elvanor> ha, if it is windows only, it will be useless for me

2011-08-26T03:21:42  <jds> I'm using selenium-webdriver 2.4 with capybara.  I believe I need a wait_for_frame_to_load method, which as far as I can tell only exists in the legacy driver
2011-08-26T03:21:47  <jds> Is there an alternative
2011-08-26T03:22:56  <__mike> I don't know about the particular binding you are using but in the Java version the .get() method already blocks till the page loads. Otherwise in Java bindings you can set implicit wait times and use WebDriverWait for further flexibility

2011-08-26T03:31:52  <AutomatedTester> Ajay_: do pip install selenium --upgrade
2011-08-26T03:32:17  <jds> __mike: I keep getting spurious errors that suggest that the frame hasn't yet loaded by the time I check for a particular element in them
2011-08-26T03:32:52  <jds> It appears to wait for the page as a whole to load, but doesn't necessarily wait for iframes within that page
2011-08-26T03:33:22  <__mike> Set an implicit wait. The NoElementFoundException won't be thrown till the timeout finishes
2011-08-26T03:33:25  <Ajay_> tried , but  pip freeze still shows selenium==2.4.0

2011-08-26T03:54:28  <jarib_> Elvanor, __mike: i think chrome has a --start-maximized (or similar) command line switch
2011-08-26T03:54:57  <jarib_> which you can pass through the chrome.switches capability when you create the driver
2011-08-26T03:55:39  <__mike> Ah possibly. That method doesn't offer much 'portability' to resizing other browsers if you care about those too I guess. I heard about some solutions which were browser specific but they weren't acceptable for my use-case so I implemented my own solution. Possibly this is useful for Elvanor though
2011-08-26T03:55:43  <__mike> Thanks for the info jarib :)
2011-08-26T03:56:14  <jarib_> Guest54964: perhaps some version mismatch between chromedriver and chrome?
2011-08-26T03:56:54  <__mike> jarib_, that will happen (at least as of a few versions ago) even if you use latest versions. Simon told me it was there by design
2011-08-26T03:57:55  <jarib_> the failing assertion is there by design?
2011-08-26T03:58:05  <jarib_> that sounds odd

2011-08-26T03:58:41  <jarib_> ah
2011-08-26T04:00:58  <jarib_> perhaps you need driver.quit() to actually kill the server

2011-08-26T04:59:29  <blacknight> I am using 2.5.0 with Java
2011-08-26T05:00:08  <blacknight> I have a delete link which brings up a coinfirmation dialog when clicked on it
2011-08-26T05:00:46  <AutomatedTester> blacknight: can we see the code?
2011-08-26T05:00:52  <Ajay__> :gist
2011-08-26T05:00:52  <selbot2> Please paste >3 lines of text to http://gist.github.com
2011-08-26T05:01:16  <AutomatedTester> Ajay__: I dont know why your machine is picking up the wrong version
2011-08-26T05:01:16  <blacknight> I use the commands driver.findelement(<myxpath>).click() then driver.switchTo().alert().accept() for this situation
2011-08-26T05:01:44  <andref___> __mike: it is working now, thanks
2011-08-26T05:01:52  <blacknight> AutomatedTester: My code i just sent works fine in IE8
2011-08-26T05:02:01  <__mike> np andref__
2011-08-26T05:02:32  <blacknight> AutmatedTester: But when used with Firefox 3 and 5, the script hangs for ever in the click()
2011-08-26T05:02:49  <blacknight> And does not even come to the switchTo().alert() command
2011-08-26T05:03:04  <Ajay__> AutomatedTester: :) , i am trying to figure out from yesterday , let me uninstall and start as a fresh
2011-08-26T05:03:19  <AutomatedTester> Ajay__: do pip install selenium --upgrade
2011-08-26T05:03:28  <AutomatedTester> in case something is caching it
2011-08-26T05:05:11  <blacknight> AuotmatedTester: Have you experienced any "hanging" like this
2011-08-26T05:06:14  <Ajay__> AutomatedTester: its the same again https://gist.github.com/1173293
2011-08-26T05:06:25  <AutomatedTester> blacknight: no sorry
2011-08-26T05:06:59  <AutomatedTester> Ajay__: something is wrong on your machine
2011-08-26T05:07:04  <AutomatedTester> i dont know what though
2011-08-26T05:07:33  <blacknight> AutomatedTester: It seems like IE Driver is better than Firefox at least for Now
2011-08-26T05:07:48  <AutomatedTester> blacknight: maybe on your machine
2011-08-26T05:07:51  <Ajay__> AutomatedTester:  :) (its windows it has to be )
2011-08-26T05:08:14  <AutomatedTester> blacknight: we have extensive tests around alerts so would know when they didnt work
2011-08-26T05:09:21  <blacknight> AutomatedTester: Pop ups are the problem with Firefox Driver, I could handle even onload ones with IE :)

2011-08-26T06:42:01  <jarib> there are some other gems to help with page objects in ruby (i think you linked one from a smattering)

2011-08-26T06:45:07  <AutomatedTester> easykians: I dont use the IDE but you may either have to do storeEval where you strip it out or if there is a storeAttibute, do it for the onclick
2011-08-26T06:45:20  <AutomatedTester> and then just strip it to get what you want
2011-08-26T06:45:41  <adamgoucher> i think there is a storeAlert which then you'll have to storeEval on (waiting for firefox to let me enable se-ide)

2011-08-26T06:45:59  <easykians> mhh problem is that i can not verify that i am working in the popup
2011-08-26T06:46:20  <adamgoucher> se-ide overrides popup handling
2011-08-26T06:46:31  <easykians> waitforpopup is not working because it can not declare the popup window
2011-08-26T06:46:44  <easykians> and this makes me crank :-)
2011-08-26T06:47:18  <easykians> because i want to use selenium RC withwout any frameworks or csharp programming "simple selenium script"
2011-08-26T06:47:30  <adamgoucher> then use webdriver, which will also make you crank, but in the long run will also make you successful -- something you cannot do with se-ide
2011-08-26T06:47:34  <easykians> this is why i want to store the conversation id
2011-08-26T06:47:59  <easykians> which is insert the open window LINK

2011-08-26T07:28:43  <AutomatedTester> now do a regex on the URL for what you want
2011-08-26T07:28:52  <easkians> but how will i do it with the URL
2011-08-26T07:28:57  <__mike> var lala = "asdfasdfId=123123"; var chop = "Id="; lala.slice( lala.indexOf('Id=') + chop.length );
2011-08-26T07:29:05  <__mike> would return 123123 for example

2011-08-26T07:29:37  <easkians> and how i search in the URL ?
2011-08-26T07:30:19  <easkians> or how will i get the active URL to a string?
2011-08-26T07:30:34  <__mike> no idea, i don't use selenium ide
2011-08-26T07:30:54  <__mike> however
2011-08-26T07:31:03  <__mike> you can get it with javascript with document.URL
2011-08-26T07:31:06  <easkians> many thanks i will try it out
2011-08-26T07:31:34  <easkians> and how can i put a javascript into my selenium testcase ?
2011-08-26T07:31:46  <easkians> will selenium RC understand it and hande it ?
2011-08-26T07:31:49  <easkians> handle it ?
2011-08-26T07:32:11  <__mike> ah wait
2011-08-26T07:32:15  <__mike> you are using selenium RC?
2011-08-26T07:32:22  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, you going to GTAC?

2011-08-26T07:35:50  <jimevans> hi. s'up?
2011-08-26T07:36:11  <XRayCulver> that example i showed you yesterday, where one works in ie and the other doesn't, it appears its opposite in chrome
2011-08-26T07:36:23  <jimevans> ok
2011-08-26T07:36:41  <jimevans> i know next to nothing about the inner workings of the chrome driver.
2011-08-26T07:36:45  <XRayCulver> the selectelement() works as it should
2011-08-26T07:36:58  <XRayCulver> which is how i'd rather use it
2011-08-26T07:37:22  <jimevans> well, that the way it *should* work.
2011-08-26T07:37:27  <XRayCulver> will it be alot to get selectelement() working in ie?
2011-08-26T07:37:41  <XRayCulver> the .selectbytext()
2011-08-26T07:38:22  <jimevans> ideally, it should also be working in IE, but I don't know why it's not. I have a suspicion, but no real way to test it out.
2011-08-26T07:38:34  <XRayCulver> ok
2011-08-26T07:38:42  <jimevans> let me tinker with it.

2011-08-26T08:32:12  <jarib> though relying on walking the DOM up and down will be brittle. better to structure the markup so locating elements is as simple as possible
2011-08-26T08:32:42  <jrock20041> So what I wrote above, fails

2011-08-26T10:56:54  <jimevans> using fireEvent('onchange') doesn't.
2011-08-26T10:57:36  <jimevans> i'm finding the click atom a little hard to follow, so i'm hoping you can help me understand how to implement the above in the atom.
2011-08-26T10:57:52  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-08-26T10:58:14  <jimevans> I think bot.action.setSelected() is the right place, but I'm not sure.
2011-08-26T10:58:30  <jimevans> and i clearly want this only to be for IE, not any other browser.
2011-08-26T10:59:16  <jimevans> sorry, the correct place is (again, i *think*) in bot.action.selectOptionElement_
2011-08-26T11:01:06  *** stepheneb has joined #selenium
2011-08-26T11:02:06  <dawagner> jimevans: Are you saying that gist's javascript *does* somehow fire the correct event?
2011-08-26T11:02:14  <jimevans> yes, it does.
2011-08-26T11:02:29  <dawagner> So if we just replace:
2011-08-26T11:02:30  <jimevans> i'm looking more closely at the atom code now.
2011-08-26T11:02:30  <dawagner> element.selected = selected;
2011-08-26T11:02:34  <dawagner> with
2011-08-26T11:02:39  <dawagner> A setAttribute call
2011-08-26T11:02:42  <dawagner> Magic should happen?
2011-08-26T11:02:58  <jimevans> i think the magic is actually in the call to .blur().
2011-08-26T11:03:39  <jimevans> and i believe you could replace the setAttribute call with element.selected = selected; and the gist would still succeed.
2011-08-26T11:04:35  <jimevans> on an option element, does the click atom call focus() on its parent select element?
2011-08-26T11:07:23  *** nilian has joined #selenium
2011-08-26T11:07:30  <dawagner> As far as I can see, we directly focus the option element directly in bot.action.focusOnElement
2011-08-26T11:08:01  <jimevans> ok.
2011-08-26T11:08:32  <dawagner> My guess is bot.action.pressAndReleaseButton_ needs to be changed so it does parent traversal for the focus, if it's an option
2011-08-26T11:08:40  <dawagner> (But only in IE! Yay!)
2011-08-26T11:09:43  *** AutomatedTester has quit IRC
2011-08-26T11:09:49  <jimevans> well, again, focusing the <select> alone isn't enough to cause the jquery change event to trigger.
2011-08-26T11:10:38  <dawagner> s/for the focus/for the focus and blur/
2011-08-26T11:10:45  <jimevans> ah. got it.
2011-08-26T11:11:01  <jimevans> i just assumed selectOptionElement_ was the right place for that.
2011-08-26T11:11:40  <jimevans> especially, since the traversal to the enclosing <select> element is already done in that method.
2011-08-26T11:12:12  <dawagner> Oh, actually, it looks like we don't blur at all, so I guess bot.action.pressAndReleaseButton_ should get a blur call after releaseButton
2011-08-26T11:12:30  <dawagner> As far as I know, setSelected isn't actually used any more? The code shouldn't exist
2011-08-26T11:13:17  <jimevans> in mouse.js, there's a call to it in clickElement_
2011-08-26T11:13:55  <jimevans> tracing the expected call stack is challenging for me. :)
2011-08-26T11:14:00  <dawagner> In that case, sure, dump it there :)

2011-08-26T13:54:14  <lukeis> BenGrailsGuy: I avoid CSS related testing, unless it's for the header / footer... otherwise you'll be updating your tests all the time (unless there's something that HAS to be in that corporate color....) As for forms and stuff... have you tried submitting the forms without Javascript enabled? (Like sending junk data / possible sql injection or xss through htmlunit)
2011-08-26T13:55:56  <BenGrailsGuy> I don't see how I would know whether my sql injection broke the system or not. Should I just check to see if it gets to the next page?
2011-08-26T13:56:00  <autojack> am I right in thinking that I can modify arbitrary Firefox preferences via the webdriver profile class?

2011-08-26T14:00:53  <BenGrailsGuy> what i'm thinking is maybe I should have a page object representing the DB

2011-08-26T14:01:33  <BenGrailsGuy> or should i just make the DB-checking as part of the page object i already use for the form?
2011-08-26T14:01:37  <lukeis> you already have a page object or similar for the form right?
2011-08-26T14:01:40  <lukeis> yes

The way it SHOULD be and what i'm trying to make it be like, is have the test run withing the application while testing from the outside... thus, i can access boht the front end and the database.
2011-08-26T15:22:03  <BenGrailsGuy> functional testing is just testing from the web end without the db access... which is kidn of useless if you want to test for SQL injection

2011-08-26T15:29:54  <lukeis> You don't have to run "inside" your application to connect to the database... well depends on how your systems are setup i guess. But typically your tests should be 'next' to you application, not in it.
