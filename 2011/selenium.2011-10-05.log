2011-10-05T01:02:55  <apassi> hi, about ruby binding (selenium-webdriver). If i set clipboard format to ruby from IDE, and copy&paste the command @driver.get '/' to ruby code, it wont work because ruby seems to handle paths as absolute. Can i define some baseurl or something to ruby?

2011-10-05T01:22:28  <apassi> .. and moreover, the part of the scripts are going to be common = used multiple projects, so baseUrl must be able to change
2011-10-05T01:23:14  <barancev> so, make a variable and use it
2011-10-05T01:23:47  <barancev> IDE treats each scenario as a separate test, it has no "shared variables"
2011-10-05T01:24:27  <barancev> (I mean, when you copy it it to a programming language)
2011-10-05T01:25:08  <barancev> and there is an issue #2373 about baseUrl
2011-10-05T01:25:09  <selbot2>  open/new Selenium IDE does not export baseURL in JUnit 4 (webdriver) - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2373 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Component-IDE]
2011-10-05T01:25:30  <barancev> it is actual for all formats
2011-10-05T01:28:21  <esto> selenium ide doesnt allow me to export to python
2011-10-05T01:29:32  <Ajay__> esto: what does it say ?
2011-10-05T01:30:53  <apassi> barancev: how does creating variable saves me from editing every one of the clipboard copied scripts, because i still have to edit those?
2011-10-05T01:31:19  <barancev> apassi: yes, you are right, no way
2011-10-05T01:32:16  <esto> suite export not implemente for python webdriver formatter
2011-10-05T01:32:17  <barancev> but if ever it was expoprted, you'd have to change it to usse a shared variable anyway

2011-10-05T01:34:50  <Ajay__> esto: which version of IDE are you using ,
2011-10-05T01:35:31  <barancev> fortunately, exporting tests has to be done once :)
2011-10-05T01:35:35  <Ajay__> i just tried exporting to python webdriver form selenium 1.3 it works as expected
2011-10-05T01:35:51  <barancev> Ajay__: export suite
2011-10-05T01:35:52  <apassi> I am not going to export whole script, only single commands from it, one by one. So, when i currently copy it, it is going to be "driver.get '/'", the header and footer of the final script is going to be writted by developers. So there is no full test case exports, and selenium IDE's baseUrl is irrelevant for me. Now what i am REALLY looking, is some kind "driver.baseUrl = 'http://example.com'", so when "driver.get '/'" is called, the HTTP
2011-10-05T01:36:32  <AutomatedTester> apassi: we dont have that, the driver expects the URL
2011-10-05T01:36:44  <AutomatedTester> and will always expect the full URL
2011-10-05T01:37:03  <krosenvold> dawagner: Did you get access to the repo ?
2011-10-05T01:37:09  <AutomatedTester> you can however create a variable and then do baseurl+'/'
2011-10-05T01:37:41  <barancev> apassi: how do you export a single command?
2011-10-05T01:37:53  <apassi> barancev: mark it and press CTRL+C
2011-10-05T01:37:53  <barancev> the Right Way is:
2011-10-05T01:38:16  <barancev> 1) select Options->Clipboard Format
2011-10-05T01:38:32  <barancev> 2) right click on a command and choose Copy
2011-10-05T01:39:01  <barancev> => clipboard contains a single command, no header-footer shit
2011-10-05T01:39:13  <apassi> OMG :D
2011-10-05T01:39:57  <krosenvold> AutomatedTester: I've been thinking about #710
2011-10-05T01:39:58  <selbot2>  closed/fixed BindException when TCP port limit is reached - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=710 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium]
2011-10-05T01:40:11  <AutomatedTester> krosenvold: did it hurt? :P
2011-10-05T01:40:11  <barancev> well, then after Ctrl-C you should have only copied command on the clipboard. what's about baseUrl?
2011-10-05T01:40:18  <apassi> AutomatedTester: yes i could create variable, and rewrite all the stuff i copy from IDE to vim, sound like horrible job when i like to do as fast i can 10000 asserts and gets in minimum time
2011-10-05T01:40:27  <krosenvold> I'm wondering if the .net bindings are calling abort on the http socket ?
2011-10-05T01:40:37  <krosenvold> HttpConnection whatever ;)
2011-10-05T01:41:07  * krosenvold is actually a decent .net developer, but I seem to lack windows + visual studio
2011-10-05T01:41:32  <AutomatedTester> krosenvold: since join mozilla I lack those too
2011-10-05T01:41:38  <barancev> select them all and Ctrl-C - it's "export without header and footer"
2011-10-05T01:41:41  <AutomatedTester> joining even
2011-10-05T01:41:46  <krosenvold> Who looks at .net bindings ?
2011-10-05T01:41:55  <AutomatedTester> jimevans owns them
2011-10-05T01:42:14  <AutomatedTester> I can *try* using monodevelop and mono
2011-10-05T01:42:48  <krosenvold> I'm assuming that the C# source calls "abort" on the httpclient even in non-execeptional cases
2011-10-05T01:42:59  <krosenvold> the java client used to do that
2011-10-05T01:43:10  <apassi> barancev: yes well.. i could have ruby script, where the header is already something like "driver = getDriver\ndriver.baseURL = 'http://example.com'\n" and after that i just browse with browser and IDE and copy paste commands from IDE to my scripts, without the need to rewrite manually EVERY SINGLE COPY"
2011-10-05T01:43:33  <apassi> but it seems that i need to create some wrapper for driver..
2011-10-05T01:43:37  <krosenvold> AutomatedTester: Let me know if monodevelop works for you ;)

2011-10-05T03:56:18  <barancev> yes, some tests don't work in single window mode
2011-10-05T03:56:55  <ace_me> what can I do when the browser open a new window for example at creation of a printout which opens in new window ?
2011-10-05T03:57:05  <ace_me> can I continue the test ?
2011-10-05T03:57:06  <Enf> barancev: thing is - I wonder why did it work with Firefox instead?
2011-10-05T03:57:20  <dawagner> Watching four machines downloading gecko.
2011-10-05T03:57:32  <barancev> previous versions of selenium could not run iehta in single window at all, they used to open two windows ecen if you specified -singleWindow
2011-10-05T03:57:55  <barancev> now you have to be more accurate with this option and select the mode you want
2011-10-05T03:59:01  <barancev> Enf: firefox is firefox, ie is ie ;)
2011-10-05T03:59:50  <Enf> ahh, noted :)

2011-10-05T04:33:13  <SamuraiJack> I have the following question
2011-10-05T04:33:34  <SamuraiJack> I'd like to write the tests in JS, instead of Java
2011-10-05T04:33:42  <SamuraiJack> and for that I'm planning to use Rhino
2011-10-05T04:34:01  *** nitin has joined #selenium
2011-10-05T04:34:13  <SamuraiJack> do you think it will be possible to launch the selenium server from the browser page?
2011-10-05T04:34:23  <SamuraiJack> (if it will include Rhino applet)
2011-10-05T04:35:44  <dawagner> barancev: My (possibly naive) expectation would be By.linkText("x") would be the same as filtering By.tagName("a") by element.getText().equals("x")
2011-10-05T04:37:00  <barancev> element.getText().trim().equals(locator.trim())
2011-10-05T04:37:17  <barancev> at least now it is trimming
2011-10-05T04:41:25  <dawagner> Wow, something just managed to cause a firefox crash...

2011-10-05T09:13:24  <EranM> so if you're running Firefox 7 you either shouldn't be having native events *at all* or you should have a native events component that includes this function

2011-10-05T09:27:37  <EranM> jarib: I've noticed that when you built, the 64-bit builds failed due to the lack of xpcom-config.h, presumably because the SDKs were not downloaded properly. I suggest re-building the 64-bit native components.

2011-10-05T09:36:47  <jarib> EranM: i could do that, but shouldn't the prebuilts work? i moved gcc/g++ out of the way
2011-10-05T09:36:56  <jarib> so it's just using prebuilts AFAICT

2011-10-05T09:49:48  <SamuraiJack> is it possible for page to determine, that it is running inside of selenium automation?
2011-10-05T09:49:53  <EranM> jarib: I don't have a 64-bit machine available at the moment to check if this specific prebuilt is somehow lacking.

2011-10-05T09:50:55  <jarib> although dawagner's gist (https://gist.github.com/1264811) seems to indicate the prebuilt is up to date (even though he didn't `svn st` after the build)

2011-10-05T09:53:54  <jarib> or 32-bit maybe?
2011-10-05T09:54:02  <dawagner> That was against 32-bit, because at the time you told me you were running 32 bit.  Running 64-bit now
2011-10-05T09:54:29  <jarib> yeah, because i saw the failures on 32-bit in the VMs - perhaps that works now that the prebuilt is updated

2011-10-05T10:22:46  *** methods has joined #selenium
2011-10-05T10:22:59  <dawagner> Yep, ff7x64 passed on linux
2011-10-05T10:23:06  <ner0x> What could cause checkboxes to be missing during a selenium test?
2011-10-05T10:23:20  <methods> is ruby always first out of the gate ?
2011-10-05T10:23:24  <methods> are bindings auto generated ?
2011-10-05T10:24:33  <jarib> dawagner: the updated .dlls didn't help, notifyOfSwitchToWindow is still missing on windows as well
2011-10-05T10:24:36  <Ajay> methods: we have a ruby robot
2011-10-05T10:24:36  <jarib> methods: no and no
2011-10-05T10:25:05  <Ajay> jarib: is the ruby bot :)
2011-10-05T10:25:12  <jarib> hi everyone.
2011-10-05T10:25:12  <dawagner> jarib passes the Turing Test!
2011-10-05T10:25:16  <methods> ah so it generates them ?
2011-10-05T10:25:21  <jarib> i do.
2011-10-05T10:25:22  <methods> oh wait you said no
2011-10-05T10:25:49  <jarib> i generate them
2011-10-05T10:26:17  <dawagner> jarib: Do we want to hold off on release until we have this worked out?
2011-10-05T10:26:18  <methods> lol wait I'm half worried that i might be talking to a bot
2011-10-05T10:26:32  <methods> jarib:  why not auto generate ?
2011-10-05T10:26:43  <dawagner> selbot2 is (AFAIK) our only bot :)
2011-10-05T10:26:52  <dawagner> Although I'm curious about what selbot` is doing...
2011-10-05T10:26:57  <jarib> methods: Because you asked me to.
2011-10-05T10:27:08  * dawagner tickles selbot`
2011-10-05T10:27:10  <methods> lol ?
2011-10-05T10:28:13  <jarib> dawagner: not sure.. would you like to release now?
2011-10-05T10:28:34  <jarib> i'd like to figure it out
2011-10-05T10:28:45  <dawagner> Oh we should *definitely* figure it out

2011-10-05T10:31:16  <dawagner> I'm happy to wait :) But there's not a huge amount I can do to help, what with the problem being jari-specific and all...
2011-10-05T10:31:45  <jarib> ok, let me poke around a bit

2011-10-05T10:49:02  <EranM> (and the missing functions you saw, notifyOfWindowClose, are the ones that were added)
2011-10-05T10:50:07  <jarib> how does that work? wasn't the file made to communicate with something outside the process?

2011-10-05T10:53:50  <EranM> jarib: the listening socket or the established connection? looks like ordinary connection between the extension and the client

2011-10-05T10:54:31  <jarib> firefox is listening on 7055
2011-10-05T10:55:31  <EranM> jarib: not sure about this socket. It's IPv6, perhaps it's behaving a bit differently?
2011-10-05T10:56:28  *** roltra has joined #selenium
2011-10-05T10:57:27  <jarib> hm
2011-10-05T10:58:02  <jarib> ah, it's the web server
2011-10-05T10:58:07  <jarib> serving the test pages
2011-10-05T10:58:38  <EranM> Right
2011-10-05T11:00:07  <jarib> so i know this: if java is involved (i.e. ./go), the tests fail, even when ./go shells out to vanilla ruby
2011-10-05T11:00:18  <jarib> if i just run the tests outside of ./go, they all pass
2011-10-05T11:01:11  <jarib> it sounds to me like crazyfun is opening a file or socket which is inherited by its children
2011-10-05T11:01:24  <jarib> which is preventing native events from working
2011-10-05T11:02:50  <EranM> But that'd only happen if crazyfun forks
2011-10-05T11:03:33  <jarib> it probably does at some point

2011-10-05T13:23:20  <jarib> lord1234: you can find the select element and call .clear on it before selecting an option
2011-10-05T13:25:50  <eekboom> When I play back a "click" in the IDE it does not do anything because the element in question reacts on mouseDown.
2011-10-05T13:26:25  <eekboom> In my Java-Scripted tests I can do this to make "click" work even for elements that react on mouseDown or MouseUp: profile.setEnableNativeEvents(true);

2011-10-05T13:35:28  <eekboom> So the "target" should be "css=.myButton" I guess

2011-10-05T13:43:22  <eekboom> No idea about xpath. I think a best practice is to use css selectors: css=input[id=file_field][type=file]
2011-10-05T13:43:59  <eekboom> Though if you select by id, you shouldn't need to test for anything else, right: css=#file_field

2011-10-05T15:10:19  <Renacor> I don't understand how java can have "memory leaks"
2011-10-05T15:10:27  <dawagner> I was also curious that it managed to put some of its files on my SSD and some on my non-SSD, on my home machine, which meant it had to spin up an idle disc to launch the browser.  I loved those extra several seconds of waiting.
2011-10-05T15:10:37  <Renacor> or is there stuff that the gc will never collect and is considered a leak
2011-10-05T15:10:47  <jleyba> Renacor: auto-gc does not mean no memory leaks
2011-10-05T15:11:01  <jleyba> Or rather, infinite heap space
2011-10-05T15:11:01  <dawagner> Renacor: Was it a particularly long-lived/often-used server instance?
2011-10-05T15:11:24  <Renacor> jleyba: heh I thought the gc was one of the main points people want to use java so they don't have to manage it themselves

2011-10-05T15:14:40  <Renacor> not so much a leak but possibly size could be too big
2011-10-05T15:14:52  <Renacor> btw Im not really a java dev
2011-10-05T15:14:53  <jleyba> So if you read in a 100MB file, you're still using 100MB even though the substring is 20 chars

2011-10-05T15:20:55  <dawagner> Does the browser appear in the dock?
2011-10-05T15:21:05  <jleyba> Yeah, it launches briefly then quits
2011-10-05T15:21:19  <dawagner> Does it ever get focus?
2011-10-05T15:21:28  <dawagner> Some bits of the OperaDriver don't work without focus - try focusing it...
2011-10-05T15:22:59  <jarib> jleyba: from the error message, is it possible you have another version of protobuf in your classpath?
2011-10-05T15:24:05  <jleyba> I shouldn't

2011-10-05T23:29:37  <stephend> here's our log: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1348139
2011-10-05T23:34:38  <barancev> error 500, I've seen here on irc discussions about more error 500 situations and loosing sessions

2011-10-05T23:34:51  <stephend> I've figured out a few of them
2011-10-05T23:34:55  <stephend> modal dialogs
2011-10-05T23:35:04  <stephend> OOM exceptions in taking screenshots
2011-10-05T23:35:18  <stephend> both seem to keep the session around for far too long
2011-10-05T23:36:40  <stephend> we had errors when using sauce w/screenshots, too
2011-10-05T23:36:48  <stephend> they had to bump up memory on the boxes, and that fixed it
2011-10-05T23:37:04  <stephend> we're kind of stuck with the maxed-out RAM we have on our Mac Minis

2011-10-05T23:40:05  <stephend> BTW, we're using "RC" mode with 2.6.0
2011-10-05T23:40:27  <stephend> we're on the path to converting a 105-test suite into Sel 2, but it'll be slow-going this quarter, probably
2011-10-05T23:40:37  <barancev> I think :newissue is a good thing in any case :)

2011-10-05T23:41:01  <barancev> and what about this: http://code.google.com/p/selenium-fasttrack/source/browse/trunk/chrome/content/selenium/scripts/htmlutils.js?spec=svn65&r=65#190
2011-10-05T23:41:18  <barancev> do you have any problems with spaces?
2011-10-05T23:41:30  <stephend> not sure how I'd tell, but yeah, we got that exception
2011-10-05T23:41:32  <stephend> as well as another
2011-10-05T23:41:49  <stephend> I'm also now watching http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2219
2011-10-05T23:42:15  <stephend> yeah, I should file a clean, new bug
2011-10-05T23:42:35  <barancev> what exception? there is no exceptions in normalizeSpaces
2011-10-05T23:42:38  <stephend> our original, http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2037, is getting tired
2011-10-05T23:42:53  <stephend> barancev: sorry, slow-script warning, rather

2011-10-05T23:46:47  <barancev> what was the command when the script reported slow?
2011-10-05T23:47:05  <barancev> it's behind the dialog
2011-10-05T23:50:01  <stephend> here's the stack; let me find the last command
2011-10-05T23:50:03  <stephend> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1348156
2011-10-05T23:50:28  <stephend> we use page objects, so will hunt it down
2011-10-05T23:51:51  <stephend> here's the lines of code: https://github.com/mozilla/Socorro-Tests/blob/master/test_crash_reports.py#L268
2011-10-05T23:52:35  <stephend> let me check a sauce build -- easier to see the full sel calls

2011-10-05T23:55:06  <stephend> does that link work?
2011-10-05T23:58:06  <stephend> getCssCount("css=table#signatureList > tbody > tr")
2011-10-05T23:58:09  <stephend> might be that, not sure
2011-10-05T23:58:27  <stephend> takes 22 seconds to do that
2011-10-05T23:59:07  <stephend> now, let me see how big that page is
