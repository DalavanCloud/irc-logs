2011-07-16T04:06:49  <olle_hacknighter> Just slackers like me.
2011-07-16T04:07:19  <simonstewart> It's not slack to be on irc at the weekend.
2011-07-16T04:07:23  <simonstewart> I think

2011-07-16T04:09:40  <olle_hacknighter> Selenium is not leavning SVN anytime soon, right? Got curious, now that Google Code might support Git.
2011-07-16T04:09:58  <simonstewart> There's going to be a debate on the mailing lists
2011-07-16T04:10:09  *** Mayank has quit IRC
2011-07-16T04:10:15  <olle_hacknighter> I'll be quiet about that. Bikes will shed
2011-07-16T04:10:35  *** Mayank has joined #selenium
2011-07-16T04:10:36  <simonstewart> Well, I doubt it's going to be a very scientific discussion
2011-07-16T04:11:03  <simonstewart> https://twitter.com/#!/shs96c/status/91901760024743937
2011-07-16T04:11:58  <simonstewart> ./go clean release
2011-07-16T04:12:09  <olle_hacknighter> From a slacker-developer standpoint, what could improve participation much would be a couple of linked, ready-made Google Code searches. Such as "Python issues here, go hack!"
2011-07-16T04:12:23  <simonstewart> Nice idea
2011-07-16T04:13:16  <olle_hacknighter> If we have good tagging, such as "low-hanging fruit" or "easy", it would be even more open-door to new-comers.

2011-07-16T04:15:15  <olle_hacknighter> I made a very small Py function called css_ready(css_expr, timeout=5) that has the kind of jQuery(document).ready() semantics, almost. It passes if the CSS expression was located within the timeout.

2011-07-16T04:15:47  *** Mayank has joined #selenium
2011-07-16T04:16:30  <olle_hacknighter> Does this function already exist in the Python bindings? I was fond of seeing normal Python control structure doing all the work of the script, not resorting to special "DSL" details. But, now I worry I'm reinventing existing stuff.
2011-07-16T04:17:40  <simonstewart> There's the "wait" classes that support that kind of thing
2011-07-16T04:19:17  <simonstewart> OK. Should I release Selenium 2.1 now?
2011-07-16T04:19:25  <simonstewart> Or wait until Monday?

2011-07-16T04:23:32  <simonstewart> Well, since we're aiming for weekly releases for a while, I'm not sure how newsworthy I want releases to be
2011-07-16T04:24:07  <olle_hacknighter> Well put.
2011-07-16T04:24:29  *** Mayank has quit IRC
2011-07-16T04:25:39  <olle_hacknighter> Then, release the hounds. I have no idea how that plays for the Maven people.
2011-07-16T04:27:01  <simonstewart> Heh. The Maven release tends to be a few days later
2011-07-16T04:27:11  <simonstewart> There's always something that needs fiddling with
2011-07-16T04:29:48  <olle_hacknighter> Does the release have a slogan? Anything New? A Changelog?
2011-07-16T04:30:23  <simonstewart> The changelog should be easy enough to create
2011-07-16T04:30:30  <simonstewart> There's a bunch of fixes in Grid
2011-07-16T04:30:57  <simonstewart> And a nice fix for some native events that were causing problems with various browsers
2011-07-16T04:33:04  <simonstewart> Right. Need to spend some time doing DIY.
2011-07-16T04:33:22  <simonstewart> Will wait for jarib, AutomatedTester and jimevans to +1 the release
