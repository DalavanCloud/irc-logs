2011-08-27T02:36:03  <imanc> how do I match just a partial selection of text with verifyText â€¦. I'm locating a paragraph tag that contains a chunk of text, some of it generated and not known to selenium (e.g order numbers). So I just want to match a fragment, e.g. "Thank you for your order" - any ideas?

2011-08-27T11:32:14  <Siph0n> not sure if that gets the http or https part of the url tho
2011-08-27T11:33:41  <imanc> hmm
2011-08-27T11:33:48  <imanc> just googlig
2011-08-27T11:33:50  <imanc> googling
2011-08-27T11:37:14  <cgoldberg> imanc, with selenium, you can get network traffic directly.   not sure you can in webdriver
2011-08-27T11:37:51  <cgoldberg> imanc, so you could inspect all http headers and verify url's are https for a page and all it's assets/content.
2011-08-27T11:38:56  <imanc> wow, that sounds great
2011-08-27T11:38:58  <stephend> iirc, we use urllib/urllib2 or the "request" module in Python to extend our Selenium
2011-08-27T11:39:11  <stephend> but that's another import, of course :-)
2011-08-27T11:40:08  <imanc> the docs are not that easy to get into - I'm also reading a book on selenium.
2011-08-27T11:40:24  <stephend> which one?  David's? :-)
2011-08-27T11:40:34  <imanc> I'm reading..
2011-08-27T11:40:54  <imanc> Selenium 1.0 Testing Tools Beginners Guide
2011-08-27T11:41:11  <stephend> yeah
2011-08-27T11:41:18  <stephend> that's David Burns'
2011-08-27T11:41:20  <stephend> great book
2011-08-27T11:41:32  <imanc> yeh it's helpful
2011-08-27T11:41:50  <imanc> never heard of pythons request module
2011-08-27T11:42:02  <imanc> ahh urllib
2011-08-27T11:42:16  <stephend> imanc: you using Python?
2011-08-27T11:42:20  <imanc> yes
2011-08-27T11:42:25  <stephend> cool
2011-08-27T11:42:56  <imanc> the app is django, but I have standard python unittests sat on a server. It's also using sauce labs
2011-08-27T11:43:16  <stephend> very cool

2011-08-27T11:46:27  <stephend> imanc: you guys using the page object model?
2011-08-27T11:46:31  <stephend> for Selenium?
2011-08-27T11:46:34  <stephend> or just starting out?
2011-08-27T11:46:41  <imanc> no - we've only just started out.
2011-08-27T11:46:42  <stephend> btw, "we" == Mozilla
2011-08-27T11:47:07  <stephend> if you plan on covering quite a number of pages, I'd recommend it
2011-08-27T11:47:09  <imanc> ahh cool.
2011-08-27T11:47:11  <stephend> it's saved us a lot of headache
2011-08-27T11:47:21  <stephend> http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/stephend/archives/2011/08/today-our-legac.html
2011-08-27T11:47:41  <Siph0n> whats page object model? is that using maven and the pom.xml file ?
2011-08-27T11:48:09  <stephend> https://github.com/AutomatedTester/mozwebqa-test-templates
2011-08-27T11:48:28  <stephend> Siph0n: factory method/pattern, essentially
2011-08-27T11:48:36  <stephend> base class has stuff common to all pages
2011-08-27T11:48:43  <imanc> I'm slightly wary of the tests taking too long to execute - given we deploy regularly, it would suck if we have to sit there for an hour waiting for tests to complete beforehand.
2011-08-27T11:48:51  <stephend> and then you get more specific as the classes evolve
2011-08-27T11:49:06  <stephend> imanc: we use py.test with concurrency
2011-08-27T11:49:17  <stephend> we can do py.test -rsX -n 10, e.g.
2011-08-27T11:49:24  <stephend> since you're using sauce, it'll fly by
2011-08-27T11:49:44  <stephend> imanc: although we have found some limitations with py.test
2011-08-27T11:49:50  <stephend> specifically, markers/keywords
2011-08-27T11:50:00  <stephend> https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/pytest/issue/50/select-tests-according-to-their-mark
2011-08-27T11:50:52  <stephend> imanc: do you have / are trying for Continuous Deployment?
2011-08-27T11:51:02  <stephend> we've been looking at the Etsy model
2011-08-27T11:51:11  <stephend> and trying to follow suite where it makes sense for us
2011-08-27T11:51:50  <imanc> stephend: no, it's not the aim at this stage. We just want to incorporate front-end testing to accompany the unit testing / integration/ smoke testing that we do already
2011-08-27T11:51:56  <stephend> gotcha
2011-08-27T11:52:18  <stephend> yeah, our devs didn't want Selenium blocking a release call either
2011-08-27T11:52:20  <stephend> in terms of time
2011-08-27T11:52:34  <stephend> but it's helpful to catch environmental issues
2011-08-27T11:52:41  <stephend> so we've hooked up Graphite
2011-08-27T11:52:59  <imanc> yes - I can see that being a problem.
2011-08-27T11:53:01  <imanc> what is graphite/

2011-08-27T11:54:05  <imanc> ahh, cool
2011-08-27T11:54:21  <stephend> if we don't see searches, or POSTS, we know something's up with "feature X"
2011-08-27T11:54:31  <stephend> and then we can look at commits, other metrics

2011-08-27T11:55:24  <stephend> not sure how much that link will help, but it's interesting
2011-08-27T11:56:25  <imanc> yeh, it's interesting getting an idea of how big outfits work it
2011-08-27T11:56:37  <imanc> how many devs do you have on the project(s)?
2011-08-27T11:58:27  <stephend> on Add-ons, hrm, let me see
2011-08-27T11:59:21  <stephend> 8
2011-08-27T11:59:39  <stephend> one QA lead, one QA Automation lead
2011-08-27T11:59:55  <stephend> and two contractors each, for the above
2011-08-27T12:00:35  <imanc> ah, not an enormous outfit then.  We have 4 core django devs and 2 front-end devs, one who specialises in UI/mobile/RIA
2011-08-27T12:00:53  <imanc> nice

2011-08-27T13:32:31  <imanc> how easy is it to run a headless selenium rc on a linux server?
2011-08-27T13:32:54  <imanc> Just wondering if I could keep it all local instead of using sauce labs
2011-08-27T13:33:01  <cgoldberg> imanc, you using python right?
2011-08-27T13:33:05  <imanc> yes
2011-08-27T13:34:03  <cgoldberg> imanc, it's pretty easy
2011-08-27T13:34:26  <cgoldberg> imanc, you using webdriver or remote webdriver or what?
2011-08-27T13:34:53  <imanc> I'm really new to all this - not entirely sure differences and pros/cons over RC or webdriver
2011-08-27T13:35:05  <imanc> I take it webdriver is newer

2011-08-27T13:35:26  *** xirkus has quit IRC
2011-08-27T13:35:38  <cgoldberg> imanc, ah.. yes.. then take a step back first.. i can try to explain it to you
2011-08-27T13:35:47  <imanc> OK
2011-08-27T13:36:34  <cgoldberg> imanc, webdriver is the new API (in Selenium2)
2011-08-27T13:36:56  *** towski has quit IRC
2011-08-27T13:36:57  <imanc> OK I thought as much - so it's meant as an eventually replacement to RC?
2011-08-27T13:36:59  <cgoldberg> imanc, so.. it's newer than the Selenium API.. and has some advantages
2011-08-27T13:37:04  <imanc> ahh
2011-08-27T13:37:21  *** xirkus has joined #selenium
2011-08-27T13:37:38  <cgoldberg> imanc, there is no RC in Seleneium2... it's just called Selenium Server.  You would access it with something like Remote Webdriver.
2011-08-27T13:37:39  *** cakehero has quit IRC
2011-08-27T13:37:54  <imanc> ah OK
2011-08-27T13:37:59  <cgoldberg> but WebDriver can also run locally.. without the need for a server at all
2011-08-27T13:38:17  <imanc> does it need a browser to be installed?
2011-08-27T13:38:23  <cgoldberg> imanc, of course
2011-08-27T13:38:40  <imanc> ahh OK
2011-08-27T13:38:59  <cgoldberg> but you can hide that in an Xvfb (headless X-server).. so it doesn't need a display set
2011-08-27T13:39:38  <imanc> ahh that sounds cool
2011-08-27T13:40:08  <cgoldberg> imanc, in Python, you use pyvirtualdisplay ... it couldn't be simpler
2011-08-27T13:40:19  <cgoldberg> imanc, see this:  http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.com/2011/06/python-headless-selenium-webdriver.html
2011-08-27T13:40:35  <cgoldberg> imanc, that is using webdriver in a headless setup
2011-08-27T13:40:40  <imanc> this is looking awesome
2011-08-27T13:41:15  <cgoldberg> imanc, what's your ultimate goal here?

2011-08-27T13:42:23  <imanc> I take it you can just install firefox with the package manager?
2011-08-27T13:43:07  <cgoldberg> imanc, yes.. but again.. if you give me some context I can probably provide some tips
2011-08-27T13:43:20  <imanc> it's a 10.4 ubuntu server
2011-08-27T13:43:24  <cgoldberg> ok

2011-08-27T13:43:42  <cgoldberg> so it prob doesn't have a browser installed
2011-08-27T13:43:52  <cgoldberg> $ sudo apt-get install firefox
2011-08-27T13:44:18  <cgoldberg> then follow the instructions in the blog post I just linked
2011-08-27T13:45:53  <imanc> ahh it's installing all of gnome - which I guess it needs to do anyway
2011-08-27T13:46:16  <jarib_> nope
2011-08-27T13:46:17  <cgoldberg> imanc, firefox needs what it needs :)  (which is prob a*lot*)
2011-08-27T13:46:26  <imanc> haha yes
2011-08-27T13:46:27  <imanc> :)
2011-08-27T13:46:38  <jarib_> gnome is not among those things..
2011-08-27T13:47:08  <jarib_> and launching a headless display with a full gnome desktop is going to be expensive
2011-08-27T13:47:19  <imanc> Unpacking gnome-keyring (from .../gnome-keyring_2.92.92.is.2.30.3-0ubuntu1.1_i386.deb) ...
2011-08-27T13:47:28  <jarib_> actually, the debian package has other issues as well
2011-08-27T13:47:29  <imanc> Unpacking gnome-icon-theme (from .../gnome-icon-theme_2.28.0-1ubuntu1_all.deb) ...
2011-08-27T13:47:33  <imanc> yeh?
2011-08-27T13:47:42  <jarib_> since debian is branding their firefox as iceweasel
2011-08-27T13:48:03  <jarib_> much better to grab the download from mozilla directly
2011-08-27T13:48:40  <imanc> jarib_: I guess that's the same issue for ubuntu then?
2011-08-27T13:48:41  *** xirkus has quit IRC
2011-08-27T13:48:47  <jarib_> yes
2011-08-27T13:48:55  <cgoldberg> what issue?
2011-08-27T13:49:00  <cgoldberg> Ubuntu packages real firefox
2011-08-27T13:49:28  <imanc> cgoldberg: that worked
2011-08-27T13:49:42  <jarib_> there are known issues with webdriver and iceweasel
2011-08-27T13:49:44  <imanc> python head_test.py
2011-08-27T13:49:44  <imanc> Google
2011-08-27T13:50:09  <jarib_> personally I've only had trouble with getting firefox to shutdown properly, because of the wrapper scripts
2011-08-27T13:50:42  <jarib_> which went away when I used mozilla's official package instead
2011-08-27T13:50:49  *** xirkus has joined #selenium
2011-08-27T13:51:21  <cgoldberg> imanc, glad it worked.. but no idea what "it" is
2011-08-27T13:51:21  <imanc> on this site there's a couple of pieces of tracking code running on https connections but the certs aren't signed â€¦. so it was locking up my local copy of FF
2011-08-27T13:51:51  <imanc> cgoldberg: I installed everything, copied your test script verbatim and ran it.
2011-08-27T13:52:00  <cgoldberg> imanc, a neat
2011-08-27T13:52:16  <cgoldberg> imanc, you can also have it take screenshots inside that virtual display
2011-08-27T13:52:37  <cgoldberg> imanc, so.. like I have an exception handler that takes screenshots if I have a switch enabled
2011-08-27T13:52:41  <imanc> I guess it isn't able to generate a small movie sauce labs style?
2011-08-27T13:52:50  <imanc> ah cool
2011-08-27T13:53:54  <cgoldberg> imanc, you can have it take a pic every step... but no video support natively.. not sure what sauce uses
2011-08-27T13:54:22  <imanc> yeh, i don't think it's necessary anyway
2011-08-27T13:55:00  <jarib_> imanc: check out hugs' castro repo on github
2011-08-27T13:55:28  <jarib_> or you can use ffmpeg to record a given X display
2011-08-27T13:56:20  <imanc> ahh, he works for sauce labs :)

2011-08-27T14:00:19  <imanc> cgoldberg: I guess you could also feedback screen shot links etc. to jenkins if a test fails
2011-08-27T14:01:00  <cgoldberg> imanc, i have a framework that stores a results directory of images of any failures along with my reports/logs
2011-08-27T14:01:22  <cgoldberg> imanc, is Ubuntu your main environment for running tests?
2011-08-27T14:01:22  <imanc> nice
2011-08-27T14:01:30  <imanc> cgoldberg: yes, exclusively ubuntu
2011-08-27T14:01:35  <imanc> at this time anyway
2011-08-27T14:02:50  <cgoldberg> imanc, i have a cool framework.. that's been developed on Ubuntu.  nothing makes it inherently platform specific, but it's all documented for Ubuntu and has been tested on Ubuntu
2011-08-27T14:03:21  <cgoldberg> (and developed internally at Canonical)
2011-08-27T14:03:21  <imanc> is it public?
2011-08-27T14:03:25  <imanc> oh
2011-08-27T14:03:40  <imanc> so you're an ubuntu dev :)
2011-08-27T14:03:51  <cgoldberg> it's all public and open source... it just hasn't been really announced yet
2011-08-27T14:04:24  <cgoldberg> I can show everything.. but we are just pushing it internally now.. will release on PyPI soon though
2011-08-27T14:05:08  <imanc> ah cool
2011-08-27T14:05:29  <cgoldberg> imanc, it does a lot of the stuff you have been asking about
2011-08-27T14:05:36  <jarib_> cgoldberg: if you want to know more about the iceweasel issues, eranm probably knows more about it than me
2011-08-27T14:05:52  <jarib_> may even be resolved at this point
2011-08-27T14:06:24  <jarib_> (my problems was around 3.6)
2011-08-27T14:06:27  <cgoldberg> imanc, it has headless mode.. screenshots on failures.. remote capabilities.. etc
