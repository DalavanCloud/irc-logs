2011-06-09T02:29:40  <freynaud> good morning
2011-06-09T02:38:54  *** __mike has joined #selenium
2011-06-09T02:39:38  <__mike> hi freynaud. just wanna say thanks for your help on the custom webdriver thing. stayed up a little longer last night and got it completely working. just forgot to recompile my changes back into the project : P
2011-06-09T02:40:09  <freynaud> good
2011-06-09T02:40:43  <freynaud> i'm wondering if you can have grid help you for that
2011-06-09T02:40:58  *** mravaux has joined #selenium
2011-06-09T02:41:14  <__mike> well i got it working on the grid too
2011-06-09T02:41:31  <__mike> oddly i found out something last night. for some reason you can't augment regular remotewebdriver objects like you can with the ones you get back from the grid.
2011-06-09T02:41:47  <freynaud> you could have something like {browserName='chrome', realScreenshot=true}
2011-06-09T02:42:07  <freynaud> and grid can change the browser name to chromeMike if it detects it
2011-06-09T02:42:27  <freynaud> that way on the client side, you don't need to be aware of the implementation details
2011-06-09T02:42:40  <freynaud> you only add realScreenshot true if you need them
2011-06-09T02:42:44  <__mike> ahhh that's true. you can just pass in custom parameters like that ?
2011-06-09T02:42:51  <freynaud> yes
2011-06-09T02:43:09  <__mike> oh that's pretty cool
2011-06-09T02:43:32  <freynaud> and if your proxy in grid implement TestSessionListener, you have access to the capability before it's forwarded
2011-06-09T02:43:38  <freynaud> and you can change it
2011-06-09T02:43:44  *** mravaux has left #selenium
2011-06-09T02:44:30  <freynaud> you just have to make sure you don't change it to something that doesn't exist. If it's about to be sent to a windows node and you update the browser to IE,  the hub will be confused :)
2011-06-09T02:44:30  <__mike> actually i thought about doing something similar before. i didn't know you can have custom parameters. i was gonna do like version=1000 or something and check for that. but i decided to extend the whole driver itself. that way it's more easily extendable in the future i think
2011-06-09T02:44:55  <freynaud> it's a map of object
2011-06-09T02:45:11  <freynaud> so in theory, you can have browser=chrome, VM=xxx
2011-06-09T02:45:34  <freynaud> and you can forward a 10Gb capability that contains the file of the VM :)
2011-06-09T02:46:00  <__mike> and where does that get picked up on the server side ? desiredcapabilities ?
2011-06-09T02:46:38  <freynaud> yes. The capability you put in the remoteWebDriver is transered all the way to the real driver
2011-06-09T02:46:45  <freynaud> transfered
2011-06-09T02:47:24  <__mike> transferred : D
2011-06-09T02:47:29  <freynaud> that's how  you can have chromedriver or firefox specified from the test
2011-06-09T02:47:37  <__mike> ahhh
2011-06-09T02:47:42  <freynaud> ok, it's a missing feature in irc, it should have spell check
2011-06-09T02:47:46  <__mike> : P
2011-06-09T02:47:56  <__mike> hm okay. maybe what you say is worth implementing on top of what i already have
2011-06-09T02:48:09  <freynaud> { browserName=firefox, firefox_binary=/home/ff4 }
2011-06-09T02:48:11  <__mike> going into work later. will talk to my manager about it : )
2011-06-09T02:48:27  <freynaud> will start a ff on the node in home/ff4
2011-06-09T02:49:04  *** yaf has joined #selenium
2011-06-09T02:49:37  <__mike> oh btw. do you know how i'd go about getting the window handle to the opened chrome browser ? right now i'm using getTitle() and appending " - Google Chrome" then doing FindWindow on it. but it's possible it could be wrong if another window is there with the same title
2011-06-09T02:49:47  <__mike> or is there a way to get the PID associated with the opened browser ?
2011-06-09T02:49:47  <yaf> hello, 1 question: selenium-java-2.0rc2.jar included the server or ist it only the client?
2011-06-09T02:50:42  <__mike> yaf : i THINK it's just client. if you want server bindings you can get the whole standalone one
2011-06-09T02:50:47  <freynaud> that would be in chrome driver code
2011-06-09T02:50:52  <freynaud> i'm not familiar with that
2011-06-09T02:51:18  <__mike> ah okay. thanks and also thanks for your suggestions too : )
2011-06-09T02:51:25  <freynaud> yaf: client only
2011-06-09T02:51:41  <yaf> i'm asking because i built the google sample and don't need to insert any information about the standalone-server - do you know why?
2011-06-09T02:52:03  <yaf> the sample works fine, but do i need the server too?
2011-06-09T02:52:28  <__mike> if you're just running it like new chromedriver() or new firefoxdriver(), etc. and that's all you want then no
2011-06-09T02:53:05  <__mike> server bindings are for remote stuff like running the test on another machine (or even connecting to localhost) or using grid, etc.
2011-06-09T02:53:07  <yaf> when do i need the server?
2011-06-09T02:53:14  <__mike> ^
2011-06-09T02:53:22  <yaf> yes, that's what i want to  make
2011-06-09T02:53:37  <__mike> oh. download the standalone then. and then look into remotewebdriver() or grid 2
2011-06-09T02:53:53  <yaf> ok, thanks
2011-06-09T02:54:38  <yaf> is there a client for remotewebdriver?
2011-06-09T02:54:47  <yaf> i mean another jar file?
2011-06-09T02:55:00  <AutomatedTester> hihi
2011-06-09T02:55:01  <__mike> nope. you just use the same one on the other side
2011-06-09T02:55:06  <freynaud> selenium java is the client
2011-06-09T02:55:11  <__mike> hi AutomatedTester : )
2011-06-09T02:55:12  <freynaud> standalone is client + server
2011-06-09T02:55:24  <freynaud> AutomatedTester: hello
2011-06-09T02:55:46  <yaf> and instead of using new FirefoxDriver i have to use new Webdriver?
2011-06-09T02:56:16  <__mike> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RemoteWebDriver
2011-06-09T02:57:51  <__mike> you run the server jar on the server side. it will give you a url to connect to. you then use that url and desiredcapabilities in remotewebdriver on client side to connect and run a test
2011-06-09T02:57:53  <yaf> that's what i read but i can not  find any input for the server-ip-adress
2011-06-09T02:58:30  <freynaud> RemoteWebDriver( new URL( server/wd/hub ) , capability )
2011-06-09T02:59:06  <yaf> ok, is there anywhere doc about the URL
2011-06-09T02:59:08  <yaf> and capa
2011-06-09T02:59:26  <__mike> if you run 'java -jar selenium-standalone.jar'
2011-06-09T02:59:33  <__mike> it will tell you the address to connect to
2011-06-09T02:59:47  <yaf> i have that address already
2011-06-09T03:00:02  <yaf> what means server/wd/hub?
2011-06-09T03:00:13  <__mike> for desiredcapabilities you can either use the builtin static options like desiredcapabilities.chrome() or you can create an empty desiredcapabilities object then use the setters to set the capabilities
2011-06-09T03:00:16  *** cheezy has joined #selenium
2011-06-09T03:00:49  <yaf> ok i'll try it
2011-06-09T03:00:55  <__mike> server is the address of the server. for example if i run the java command on my machine it will tell me that remotewebdriver instances should connect to "http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub"
2011-06-09T03:00:55  <freynaud> new URL("http://ipofyourserver:port/wd/hub") will be the url

2011-06-09T03:16:26  <simonstewart> and this is parsing the command line args and not quite getting things right
2011-06-09T03:16:44  <kensho> so it's a bug? or a mistake on my part?

2011-06-09T03:35:00  <freynaud> i personally use it for the ssl stuff, but this is not big enough to be a problem

2011-06-09T03:54:19  <simonstewart> The remote server already handles that
2011-06-09T03:54:21  <freynaud> at the moment grid throws html back to the client when it crashes, it's not elegant
2011-06-09T03:54:26  <ato> Are there any plans for an RC3, or are we going straight for final?
2011-06-09T03:54:34  <freynaud> but I need to serialize it properly on grid then
2011-06-09T03:54:40  <simonstewart> I think an rc3 is wise given how much we've moved things around

To built chrome driver executable , I checkout  code from http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch/p#OAMlx_jo-ck/src/chrome/test/webdriver/automation.cc&exact_package=chromium  and compiled to arm toolchain and generated chrome driver executable (On top of chrome we built chrome driver binary).

2011-06-09T05:45:53  <samuel> yes i can see the page
2011-06-09T05:46:11  <samuel> private static WebElement waitForElement(final String locator) {
2011-06-09T05:46:11  <samuel>         return new WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(new Function<WebDriver, WebElement>() {
2011-06-09T05:46:11  <samuel>             public WebElement apply(WebDriver driver) {
2011-06-09T05:46:11  <samuel>                 return driver.findElement(By.id(locator));
2011-06-09T05:46:11  <samuel>             }

2011-06-09T05:46:12  <samuel>     }
2011-06-09T05:46:49  <simonstewart> It's Really Not a Good Idea, but what happens if you put a Thread.sleep(5000) in before the call to findElement?
2011-06-09T05:47:04  <samuel> okay would try that now
2011-06-09T05:47:07  <simonstewart> Looking at the stacktrace, it appears as if the chromedriver doesn't think that the page is loaded
2011-06-09T05:49:08  <samuel> that doesnt help, is till get the same error - 19884:19898:530384081946:ERROR:base_paths_linux.cc(104)] Couldn't find your source root.  Try running from your chromium/src directory.
2011-06-09T05:49:26  <simonstewart> Very odd.
2011-06-09T05:49:37  <simonstewart> Can you please send an email to the webdriver google group?
2011-06-09T05:49:47  <samuel> okay i will do that
2011-06-09T05:49:48  <simonstewart> The guys who are most familiar with the chrome driver are in the US

2011-06-09T05:50:05  <samuel> okay thanks for your time

2011-06-09T07:37:56  <ghfdhgdhf> where?
2011-06-09T07:38:39  <freynaud> this is a java class with only a main method. Create an empty project, add selenium-server-standalone in the classpath , and run it
2011-06-09T07:38:59  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: what is the condition?
2011-06-09T07:39:02  <freynaud> you should have the exception. Comment out current() and see if the new method retuns the correct ip for you
2011-06-09T07:39:04  <AutomatedTester> on test failure?
2011-06-09T07:39:08  <AutomatedTester> or wait failure?

2011-06-09T08:09:31  <ghfdhgdhf> freynaud: yes it's returning the server ip
2011-06-09T08:09:45  <ghfdhgdhf> freynaud: this seems to be a problem with my server set up
2011-06-09T08:09:58  <ghfdhgdhf> freynaud: my tech support is being useless at the the moment
2011-06-09T08:10:09  <freynaud> ghfdhgdhf: so the first one doesn't return it, and test() does ?
2011-06-09T08:10:33  <ghfdhgdhf> yes
2011-06-09T08:10:38  <ghfdhgdhf> I don't know what that means
2011-06-09T08:10:52  <ghfdhgdhf> god damn it....do I have to compile the source with this change ?
2011-06-09T08:11:29  <ghfdhgdhf> freynaud: I am googling getLocalHost UnknownHostException
2011-06-09T08:12:12  <ghfdhgdhf> If the host has a static IP address then the simple workaround is to  correct /etc/hosts so that the hostname resolves to the correct  address.
2011-06-09T08:12:31  <ghfdhgdhf> I mean there's alreayd localhost ips as expected
2011-06-09T08:12:36  <ghfdhgdhf> do I add the server's ip ?
2011-06-09T08:12:46  <ghfdhgdhf> ugh so confused
2011-06-09T08:12:50  <ghfdhgdhf> haven't slept for 24 hours
2011-06-09T08:13:04  <freynaud> the 2nd method works better , and it's already part of selenium utils
2011-06-09T08:13:24  <ghfdhgdhf> yes but I have to compile the source with that change right?
2011-06-09T08:13:27  <freynaud> i'll update after running the tests
2011-06-09T08:13:31  <freynaud> correct
2011-06-09T08:13:39  <ghfdhgdhf> okay so where can I find the source...
2011-06-09T08:14:08  <freynaud> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/checkout
2011-06-09T08:14:19  <ghfdhgdhf> hold on I thin I might ahve found a solution
2011-06-09T08:14:24  <freynaud> to produce the jars : ./go release
2011-06-09T08:14:34  <freynaud> it will be in buid/dist
2011-06-09T08:17:34  <ghfdhgdhf> okay so what is it exactly complaining about?
2011-06-09T08:17:39  <ghfdhgdhf> when it throws UnknownHostexception?
2011-06-09T08:17:45  <ghfdhgdhf> can it not find the server's ip?
2011-06-09T08:17:54  <ghfdhgdhf> or something wrong with hosts file? it seems normal to me.
2011-06-09T08:18:08  <ghfdhgdhf> I don't think I changed any server environment variables.

2011-06-09T08:37:35  <incorrect> is it unreasonable of me to expect the same functional element to have the same id on each page?
2011-06-09T08:37:51  <ghfdhgdhf> incorrect: depends
2011-06-09T08:38:16  <ghfdhgdhf> incorrect: some sadistic ecommerce tries to prevent people scraping by generating random IDs for table elements
2011-06-09T08:38:35  <incorrect> i could understand that
2011-06-09T08:39:03  <incorrect> say for example, id=logout, but on another page id=random_guff_logout
2011-06-09T08:39:09  <ghfdhgdhf> wtf...
2011-06-09T08:39:18  <ghfdhgdhf> is that the only variations?
2011-06-09T08:39:27  <ghfdhgdhf> or will it have [randomstring]_logout?
2011-06-09T08:39:28  <incorrect> oh this site many
2011-06-09T08:39:37  <ghfdhgdhf> ugh I hate those type of sites
2011-06-09T08:39:45  <ghfdhgdhf> well in that case you would have to use Xpath
2011-06-09T08:39:48  <ghfdhgdhf> or css path
2011-06-09T08:39:51  <incorrect> ghfdhgdhf, it looks like stuff is leaking out from somewhere as i see '$' in the string
2011-06-09T08:39:59  <ghfdhgdhf> lolz
2011-06-09T08:40:13  <ghfdhgdhf> are you trying to scrape this site?
2011-06-09T08:41:35  <incorrect> no
2011-06-09T08:41:53  <incorrect> i am trying to write a test script for it that i don't have to rewrite every time they make a small change
2011-06-09T08:42:26  <incorrect> excuse me while i hit my head on the table
2011-06-09T08:42:36  <ghfdhgdhf> oh
2011-06-09T08:42:42  <ghfdhgdhf> you need to use xpath
2011-06-09T08:42:59  <incorrect> i tried copying the xpath from firebug but i get
2011-06-09T08:43:00  <ghfdhgdhf> but why do I get the feeling they will try to generate random container elements to discourage that as well
2011-06-09T08:43:16  <ghfdhgdhf> are you sure you have the correct xpath?
2011-06-09T08:43:30  <ghfdhgdhf> try using a much more robust xpath instead of absolute xpath
2011-06-09T08:43:39  <incorrect> /*[@id="<random_guff_logout"]
2011-06-09T08:43:51  <ghfdhgdhf> well in this case because the id changes from page to page
2011-06-09T08:43:59  <ghfdhgdhf> you shouldn't rely on that id attribute
2011-06-09T08:44:11  <ghfdhgdhf> so you would need something like //path/to/logout
2011-06-09T08:44:11  <incorrect> yep, so how can i get the xpath easily is my next question
2011-06-09T08:44:18  <ghfdhgdhf> are you in firebug?
2011-06-09T08:44:21  <incorrect> yes
2011-06-09T08:44:24  <ghfdhgdhf> okay right click and copy xpath
2011-06-09T08:44:36  <ghfdhgdhf> does that still give you just //*[@id] ?
2011-06-09T08:44:38  <incorrect> i did that can got what is showed you
2011-06-09T08:44:47  <ghfdhgdhf> in that case right click on the immediate parent
2011-06-09T08:44:51  <ghfdhgdhf> and copy xpath
2011-06-09T08:45:12  <ghfdhgdhf> and just concatenate the element of the logout button/link w/e
2011-06-09T08:45:20  <incorrect> thanks, good idea

2011-06-09T08:50:59  <ghfdhgdhf> incorrect: in that case you shouldn't use the absolute xpath
2011-06-09T08:51:14  <ghfdhgdhf> get the minimal xpath expression to reach that logout element
2011-06-09T08:51:14  <incorrect> what can i use?
2011-06-09T08:51:24  <ghfdhgdhf> so instead of /html/body/div[3]/div/div/div/div/a
2011-06-09T08:51:39  <ghfdhgdhf> bad example
2011-06-09T08:51:40  <ghfdhgdhf> sry
2011-06-09T08:51:48  *** andilad has quit IRC
2011-06-09T08:51:51  <ghfdhgdhf> you would end up with //div/a

2011-06-09T08:52:58  <incorrect> i think i might import lxml.html and do more processing of the document
2011-06-09T08:53:36  <ghfdhgdhf> but if this is your own application that you are trying to test.....the issues with the serverside code generating this random id string

2011-06-09T08:57:50  <ghfdhgdhf> oh

2011-06-09T08:58:22  <ghfdhgdhf> I don't think I've ever used just the ID to identify elements
2011-06-09T08:58:26  <ghfdhgdhf> probably paranoia

2011-06-09T09:18:00  <freynaud> have you tried to run a simple test on the node with everything local first
2011-06-09T09:18:09  <freynaud> to make sure firefox is there, in the path and all that
2011-06-09T09:18:44  <ghfdhgdhf> oops silly me

2011-06-09T09:18:53  <ghfdhgdhf> yes firefox is installed
2011-06-09T09:19:00  <ghfdhgdhf> I mean before using selenium I was using Hudson CI
2011-06-09T09:19:03  <freynaud> that 's why it's better to start with simple tests :p
2011-06-09T09:19:12  <freynaud> easier to debug, less layers involved
2011-06-09T09:19:46  <ghfdhgdhf> so how to define xvnc for the webdriver node?
2011-06-09T09:19:51  <ghfdhgdhf> it's basically complaining about that
2011-06-09T09:20:14  <ghfdhgdhf> anyway to define unique xvnc display when firefox launches on the webdriver node?
2011-06-09T09:20:46  <ghfdhgdhf> oh boy....maybe I should've stuck to just using Hudson CI?
2011-06-09T09:21:00  <ghfdhgdhf> so much work to get grid up and running
2011-06-09T09:21:06  <freynaud> hudson and selenium have completly different purpose
2011-06-09T09:21:12  <freynaud> you cannot use one for the other
2011-06-09T09:21:22  <freynaud> it's not really grid
2011-06-09T09:21:29  <ghfdhgdhf> well you can have slave hudson nodes
2011-06-09T09:21:30  <freynaud> if you have no display, you have no firefox
2011-06-09T09:21:36  <freynaud> no browser, no selenium

2011-06-09T10:36:22  <ghfdhgdhf> okay wut
2011-06-09T10:36:29  <ghfdhgdhf> you are using PyVirtualDisplay
2011-06-09T10:36:35  <ghfdhgdhf> oh man, I hate python tho

2011-06-09T10:39:54  <cgoldberg> ghfdhgdhf, yup my framework is all python.. so PyVirtualDisplay works like a charm
2011-06-09T10:40:04  <ghfdhgdhf> ok so after I install it
2011-06-09T10:40:14  <ghfdhgdhf> will my webdriver node know to use xvfb?
2011-06-09T10:40:29  <ghfdhgdhf> how did you specify the test to use the xvfb
2011-06-09T10:40:52  <cgoldberg> ghfdhgdhf, 1 sec, i'll get a code snippet
2011-06-09T10:40:59  <ghfdhgdhf> ty!!

2011-06-09T10:46:22  <ghfdhgdhf> is there a java wrapper?
2011-06-09T10:46:25  <adamgoucher> naturally cgoldberg will be putting up another quick blog post with that in it
2011-06-09T10:46:35  <ghfdhgdhf> I mean all of my tests are already written in Java

2011-06-09T10:47:45  <cgoldberg> ghfdhgdhf, sorry, I don't if there is a Java wrapper.  but the actual code it wraps is pretty trivial if you wanna build your own.  something might exist, but I have no idea what goes on in the Java world
2011-06-09T10:48:04  <ghfdhgdhf> I am shocked no body had written anything for it
2011-06-09T10:48:37  <ghfdhgdhf> okay so basically exec('//start xvfb on a unique display #') ???

2011-06-09T10:51:00  <polm> Colon is important.
2011-06-09T10:51:07  <ghfdhgdhf> polm: what is your approach?
2011-06-09T10:51:25  <ghfdhgdhf> like im confused
2011-06-09T10:51:28  <polm> At the moment I'm starting it in a shell script which then runs python tests
2011-06-09T10:51:31  <ghfdhgdhf> how to launch firefox test using the xvfb?
2011-06-09T10:51:37  <polm> I've also got a fabric script that starts it
2011-06-09T10:51:50  <polm> From a shell, something like this:
2011-06-09T10:51:56  <polm> Xvfb :1 &
2011-06-09T10:52:06  <ghfdhgdhf> when do you invoke it in shell?
2011-06-09T10:52:10  <polm> nosetests test_selenium.py
2011-06-09T10:52:26  <polm> like a script with those two lines ^^
2011-06-09T10:52:39  <polm> Though you need to kill Xvfb afterwards, naturally
2011-06-09T10:52:41  <ghfdhgdhf> and how do you make that test use that specific & unique xvfb display #?
2011-06-09T10:52:46  <polm> oh, right
2011-06-09T10:52:53  <polm> This is a bash thing, but:
2011-06-09T10:53:00  <polm> DISPLAY=:1 nosetests test_selenium.py
2011-06-09T10:53:08  <polm> that sets the environment variable
2011-06-09T10:53:12  <ghfdhgdhf> ah
2011-06-09T10:53:28  <ghfdhgdhf> so start xvfb at specific display #
2011-06-09T10:53:36  <ghfdhgdhf> and then set env var
2011-06-09T10:53:36  <polm> I think I"m actually calling "export DISPLAY=:1" beforehand, which sets it for future calls
2011-06-09T10:53:41  <polm> Yes.
2011-06-09T10:53:56  <ghfdhgdhf> eh.....export display???
2011-06-09T10:53:56  *** Mayank has quit IRC
2011-06-09T10:53:57  <polm> Most commands will read fro mthe environment; Xvfb will not.
2011-06-09T10:54:11  <polm> So if you write a line like this:
2011-06-09T10:54:15  <polm> DISPLAY=:1 blah blah
2011-06-09T10:54:20  <polm> that only sets the display for that one command
2011-06-09T10:54:25  *** Mayank has joined #selenium
2011-06-09T10:54:25  <polm> using this line:
2011-06-09T10:54:31  <polm> export DISPLAY=:1
2011-06-09T10:54:38  <polm> sets it for the rest of that shell's life
2011-06-09T10:54:51  <polm> Do you have a linux terminal handy?
2011-06-09T10:54:57  <ghfdhgdhf> yes
2011-06-09T10:55:01  <polm> If you type "env" you can see your environment
2011-06-09T10:55:16  <polm> You can add to it (in bash) using export
2011-06-09T10:55:19  <ghfdhgdhf> ok
2011-06-09T10:55:30  <polm> That's maintained between calls.
2011-06-09T10:55:38  <polm> It's like a global.
2011-06-09T10:56:11  <ghfdhgdhf> so I need to set a differenbt env each new test that needs to run
2011-06-09T10:57:36  <polm> Well, you can run the test, change the value, run the next test
2011-06-09T10:57:46  <polm> I assume you're running these in parallel on one box?
2011-06-09T10:57:58  <ghfdhgdhf> is it okay to do that while anothere test is already running?
2011-06-09T10:58:22  <polm> Yes, a process only holds on to its environment from the time of its invocation.
2011-06-09T10:58:49  <ghfdhgdhf> so before driver.get("http://www.google.com"); I need to do exec("Xvfb :1 & export DISPLAY=:1") ?

2011-06-09T10:59:31  <ghfdhgdhf> because I am using grid 2

2011-06-09T10:59:59  <ghfdhgdhf> I will check SO
2011-06-09T11:00:04  <polm> you can't mix exec and export - exec doesn't use bash
2011-06-09T11:00:15  <ghfdhgdhf> hmmm
2011-06-09T11:00:21  <polm> you also can't background things in exec with &

2011-06-09T11:00:44  <ghfdhgdhf> so I cant do headless with grid2?
2011-06-09T11:01:20  <polm> I hope you can, otherwise there's not much point

2011-06-09T11:05:18  <polm> freynaud: Help ghfdhgdhf.
2011-06-09T11:05:42  <ghfdhgdhf> maybe add a section on headless deployment
2011-06-09T11:06:46  <polm> ghfdhgdhf: headless shouldn't make a difference
2011-06-09T11:07:00  <polm> An X server is an X server, usually
2011-06-09T11:07:02  <ghfdhgdhf> like a guide on how to use xvfb with grid2
2011-06-09T11:07:06  <polm> Just start Xvfb on :0 or something
2011-06-09T11:07:19  <ghfdhgdhf> okay but how do I point my test to use that display #
2011-06-09T11:07:27  <polm> :0 is the default
2011-06-09T11:07:45  <freynaud> ghfdhgdhf: i'm not using Xvfb.
2011-06-09T11:08:19  <polm> freynaud: Should it make a difference? And do you only have one display per machine?
2011-06-09T11:08:19  <freynaud> but the principle are the same for all the linux based display
2011-06-09T11:08:28  *** kenkoontz has quit IRC
2011-06-09T11:08:39  <freynaud> what you can do with grid is intercept all the request.
2011-06-09T11:09:00  <freynaud> when you get a new request for node N, check what display is already used, what isn't
2011-06-09T11:09:13  <freynaud> then use the magic flags from the browsers
2011-06-09T11:09:28  <freynaud> for chrome it's flags.chrome I think
2011-06-09T11:09:51  <freynaud> that will allow you to pass some random param
2011-06-09T11:10:01  <freynaud> for instance --display :X
2011-06-09T11:10:07  <freynaud> so you'll get what you need
2011-06-09T11:10:43  <freynaud> that will also allow you to have one node for several display
2011-06-09T11:11:06  <freynaud> which makes a huge difference because you can ow assume that a proxy and the grid is an OS
2011-06-09T11:11:33  <freynaud> and you know the whole context the tests run in, you can start reverting VM etc without impacting other tests
2011-06-09T11:12:03  <freynaud> but all that takes quite some time. I don't think it's the first setup to deploy if you're discovering grid really
2011-06-09T11:12:15  <freynaud> start with a small one with real machine you can debug
2011-06-09T11:14:09  <ghfdhgdhf> wut,...

2011-06-09T11:15:37  <new2b2> hi i  have a newbie question. How can i get webdriver working for python. From my understanding I need the webdriver to be able to test in chrome/ff/ie. I cannot find a place where i can import the webdriver library though
2011-06-09T11:15:43  <new2b2> I am not sure what am i missing
2011-06-09T11:15:58  <polm> new2b2: from selenium import webdriver
2011-06-09T11:16:06  <new2b2> that doesn't work
2011-06-09T11:16:09  <autojack> this is apropos. I was wondering if Xvfb was a good way to do headless Selenium tests.
2011-06-09T11:16:39  <new2b2> there's no webdriver there, I think i am missing some step to get the webdriver into the library, i don't know where the webdriver files are that i can use for python
2011-06-09T11:16:45  <polm> autojack: Works for me!
2011-06-09T11:16:52  <autojack> cool :)
2011-06-09T11:16:56  <polm> new2b2: How did you install selenium?

2011-06-09T11:17:04  <autojack> I'll give it a try.
2011-06-09T11:18:00  <polm> autojack: that looks fine; it's not that tricky. I usually use lower display numbers, though.
2011-06-09T11:18:00  <new2b2> I am also in windows - so there is no installation that I am aware of
2011-06-09T11:18:10  <autojack> OK.
2011-06-09T11:18:33  <autojack> new2b2: you DO have to install the Python webdriver library before you can use it... :)
2011-06-09T11:18:37  <jrock20041> Has linked text changed to look at the rendered element or is it still looking at the source
2011-06-09T11:19:00  <polm> new2b2: Oh, that's a whole can of worms.

2011-06-09T13:47:18  <ghfdhgdhf> I mean come on.....no xvfb intialization....do they expect everyone to run on windows server
2011-06-09T13:47:41  <ghfdhgdhf> like I don't even know how I am going to intercept the test connecting to the hub and start the xvfb just in time
2011-06-09T13:47:57  <new2b2> zgirl: I think there's a way to set browsers to auto accept certificates
2011-06-09T13:48:57  <new2b2> zgirl: i don't know too much about it other then skimming some info about it so can't help you much, but I think it's possible (I know there are plugins for firefox that work, but didn't try out ie yet)
2011-06-09T13:49:49  <ZGirl> new2b2: Yeah, I think there's supposed to be a setting in the advanced tab in internet options like 'warn about invalid certificates', but it doesn't show up in my list. Gotta figure out why (tried nearly everything...) : )

2011-06-09T13:59:19  <ghfdhgdhf> if it's possible to execute commands on the server running the node?
2011-06-09T13:59:21  <ghfdhgdhf> RC node?
2011-06-09T13:59:33  <ghfdhgdhf> because I need to start xvfb and export display var
2011-06-09T13:59:36  <ghfdhgdhf> before firefox executes
2011-06-09T14:00:02  <ghfdhgdhf> but it seems like when I execute the test, it connects to the hub, and the hub sends the test to rc node
2011-06-09T14:01:59  <ghfdhgdhf> yeah....
2011-06-09T14:02:05  <ghfdhgdhf> it only executes on the client side not on the server
2011-06-09T14:02:13  <ghfdhgdhf> someone help please.....
2011-06-09T14:03:42  <ZGirl> new2b2: Thanks, this is an entirely new resource for me. I'll give it a shot!
2011-06-09T14:08:53  <ZGirl> new2b2: YES!!! THANKS!! It worked. After nearly 10 hours of on-and-off research, you saved me

2011-06-09T14:52:58  <barancev> snap_: immediately after your click, selenum adds 'click' action to the script. if you wait for page to load, selenium changes it to 'clickAndWait'. but if you perform the next action while page is still loading, selenium keeps 'click', if a new page is not loaded after click at all (AJAX-case), selenium keeps 'click' unchanged too

2011-06-09T16:44:30  <nilobject> Does Selenium 2 support native events on Firefox 4 (on a Mac)?
2011-06-09T16:44:51  <nilobject> I'm calling click() on elements that have "click
2011-06-09T16:45:01  <nilobject> " event handlers, but they don't get fired.
2011-06-09T16:48:13  *** sdio has quit IRC
2011-06-09T16:52:06  <jarib> nilobject: webdriver does not currently support native events on OS X, but click handlers should fire with synthesized events as well.
2011-06-09T16:52:38  <nilobject> I've never been able to get them to fire. :/
2011-06-09T16:52:58  <nilobject> I'll come up with a reduced test case and file a bug, I suppose.
2011-06-09T16:53:44  <jarib> that'd be great. we have a lot of tests that go through this exact scenario.
