2011-05-07T17:06:22  <rlpowell> On the off chance any devs are around: I created a now standalone-server from trunk to use with RemoteDriver from Ruby, beacuse I want to get moveto and/or hover working (FF4, Win7), because there's lots of stuff I simply can't test without some kind of hover.
2011-05-07T17:06:38  <rlpowell> It still doesn't work; "Cannot hover over element: native events are disabled on this platform"
2011-05-07T17:06:47  <rlpowell> Anyone have any idea what I can do with that?
