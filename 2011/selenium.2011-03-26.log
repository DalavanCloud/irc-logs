2011-03-26T13:42:56  <unixSnob> is selenium able to handle SSL cert acceptance, and javascript?
2011-03-26T13:44:55  <jarib_> unixSnob: using Selenium 1 or 2?
2011-03-26T13:45:10  <unixSnob> looks like 2
2011-03-26T13:45:29  <unixSnob> i'm just starting out.  donwloaded the client zip file
2011-03-26T13:45:39  <unixSnob> i suspect i need the server as well
2011-03-26T13:45:51  <jarib_> then in Firefox/Chrome invalid certificates should be ignored by default (with some caveats)
2011-03-26T13:45:54  <jarib_> what file did you download?
2011-03-26T13:46:12  <jarib_> for Se2 you don't need the server.
2011-03-26T13:46:23  <unixSnob> selenium-java-2.0b3.zip and selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar
2011-03-26T13:46:33  <jarib_> right
2011-03-26T13:47:26  <jarib_> so that includes two products, Selenium 1/RC and Selenium 2/WebDriver
2011-03-26T13:47:35  <unixSnob> i'm figuring this will automate logins to banking sites
2011-03-26T13:48:11  <jarib_> for WebDriver you only need the server if you want to run the test on one machine and the browser on another
2011-03-26T13:48:20  <jarib_> sure

2011-03-26T13:48:41  <unixSnob> it's quite frustrating to have to login to every bank to download statements every month.. i think selenium might be the answer
2011-03-26T13:49:04  <unixSnob> okay, thanks.. i'll just focus on the server then
2011-03-26T13:49:38  <jarib> the server won't be of much use without the client :)
2011-03-26T13:50:49  <unixSnob> guess i misunderstood you
2011-03-26T13:50:53  <unixSnob> ah, other way around.. so I just need the client
2011-03-26T13:51:12  <unixSnob> since i don't need to make the interface remote
2011-03-26T13:51:25  * jarib nods
2011-03-26T13:53:50  <unixSnob> i'm glad i could get a quick answer here.. thanks for the help jarib
2011-03-26T13:53:53  * unixSnob heads off to RTFM
2011-03-26T13:54:27  <jarib> np

2011-03-26T15:13:01  <adamgoucher> jarib: actually, i think the way we are marketing it is RC and WebDriver, not 1 and 2
2011-03-26T15:13:09  * adamgoucher could be confused though
2011-03-26T15:25:02  <jarib> i'm definitely confused
2011-03-26T15:25:09  <jarib> about the marketing
2011-03-26T15:26:02  <jarib> but RC - WebDriver is definitely more precise than 1 - 2

2011-03-26T16:01:46  <adamgoucher> hugs nicely used the example of os9 -> osx. the 'brand' is 'selenium 2' which has both remote control and webdriver (carbon and cocoa). certainly one (webdriver/cocoa) is preferred over the other (remote control/carbon)
2011-03-26T16:02:01  * adamgoucher might have got the carbon/cocoa parts flipped
2011-03-26T16:08:38  <jarib> yeah, that's a good example
2011-03-26T16:08:55  *** esteele has quit IRC
2011-03-26T16:10:55  <jarib> one problem for people who are coming to the project now is that WebDriver has a remote server part, but that's not what is reffered to as "remote control"
