2011-03-01T01:50:26  <mseidl> sorry, so, when i use -trustallsslblah , and go tht epage, i get an ssl_cert error, not a prompt about the ssl cert, but simply an error saying the cert is bad.
2011-03-01T01:51:40  <mseidl> when i do the -firefoxProfile things work, but ssl doesnt.  usign the profileTemplate firefox just wont start at all. speaking of which, where does firefox need to be for selenium to see it?  it is simply already in the path, but selenium will never find it unless i specify it.
2011-03-01T01:52:20  <mseidl> also using "*firefox /usr/bin/firefox -P selenium" doesnt work either, i tried single quoting the whole command too
2011-03-01T01:52:28  <mseidl> firefox wont even start up
2011-03-01T01:54:08  <mseidl> Got result: Failed to start new browser session: Error while launching browser on session null

2011-03-01T01:54:39  <mseidl> jarib: ^^
2011-03-01T01:56:29  <simonstewart> which version of selenium? Which OS?
2011-03-01T01:56:43  <mseidl> opensuse 11.3 and 2.0b2 i believe
2011-03-01T01:57:08  <simonstewart> Passing in the profile that way won't work
2011-03-01T01:57:20  <simonstewart> It's looking for a command "/usr/bin/firefox -P kjabfbf"
2011-03-01T01:57:28  <simonstewart> Which won't be on your system
2011-03-01T01:57:37  <simonstewart> (you can't pass in flags to firefox that way)
2011-03-01T01:57:59  <mseidl> ok, how can i pass it then?
2011-03-01T01:58:32  <simonstewart> Take a look at the BrowserConfigurationOptions class
2011-03-01T01:58:48  <mseidl> where would i find that?
2011-03-01T01:58:48  <simonstewart> http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/BrowserConfigurationOptions.html
2011-03-01T01:58:59  <mseidl> ah
2011-03-01T01:59:01  <mseidl> thanks
2011-03-01T01:59:02  <simonstewart> And pass that as an argument to Selenium.start()
2011-03-01T01:59:07  <mseidl> im using python
2011-03-01T01:59:13  <mseidl> just fyi
2011-03-01T02:00:07  <simonstewart> There's an equivalent for python
2011-03-01T02:00:52  <simonstewart> Though it's not as easy to use, admittedly
2011-03-01T02:02:47  <mseidl> python is harder to use?
2011-03-01T02:03:11  <simonstewart> The modelling of the BCO isn't as nice
2011-03-01T02:03:22  <simonstewart> You effectively need to do something like:
2011-03-01T02:03:42  <simonstewart> "profile=path/to/profile;"
2011-03-01T02:03:48  <simonstewart> Instead of having an object wrapper
2011-03-01T02:05:16  <mseidl> is it betterto use *chrome instead of firefox
2011-03-01T02:05:25  <simonstewart> *firefox defaults to *chrome
2011-03-01T02:05:31  <simonstewart> They're synonyms
2011-03-01T02:05:35  <mseidl> ok
2011-03-01T02:05:39  <simonstewart> Though until just before 1.0 they were different
2011-03-01T02:12:06  <jarib> simonstewart: the chromedriver returns tag names all upper case
2011-03-01T02:12:15  <simonstewart> Hmph.
2011-03-01T02:12:26  <simonstewart> Not sure if that's wrong or not
2011-03-01T02:12:28  <mseidl> but shouldnt these work when i am passing the command line args to the server
2011-03-01T02:12:47  <jarib> simonstewart: firefox driver calls toLowerCase() on the tag name
2011-03-01T02:13:10  <jarib> and watir-webdriver assumes it's lower case.
2011-03-01T02:13:36  <simonstewart> The docs don't make it clear either way
2011-03-01T02:13:45  <jarib> easy fix https://gist.github.com/848940
2011-03-01T02:13:48  <simonstewart> I suspect that firefox is doing the Wrong Thing
2011-03-01T02:13:50  <mseidl> i have tried this already -trustAllSSLCertificates: -firefoxProfileTemplate-profilesLocation:
2011-03-01T02:14:01  <simonstewart> When you started the selenium server?
2011-03-01T02:14:07  <mseidl> yes
2011-03-01T02:14:17  <simonstewart> jarib: because XHTML is case sensitive
2011-03-01T02:14:43  <jarib> when does it matter to the webdriver user?
2011-03-01T02:14:59  <simonstewart> Try "-firefoxProfileTemplate profilesLocation" (that is, no equals sign and a space between the args)
2011-03-01T02:15:24  <simonstewart> Who knows
2011-03-01T02:15:46  <mseidl> i never did an equals sign?
2011-03-01T02:16:12  <simonstewart> You wrote " -firefoxProfileTemplate-profilesLocation:" with a minus sign between the flag and the argument
2011-03-01T02:16:48  <mseidl> oh
2011-03-01T02:16:51  <mseidl> no, i didnt use it like that
2011-03-01T02:16:59  <mseidl> sorry, i just copied/pasted the cli args i used
2011-03-01T02:17:48  <mseidl> i used -firefoxprofiletemplate "/home.blahblah"
2011-03-01T02:18:02  <mseidl> i used -firefoxprofile "/home.blahblah"
2011-03-01T02:18:05  <simonstewart> Hmmm... that looks like it should be okay
2011-03-01T02:18:52  <simonstewart> And the directory your passing the actual profile directory?
2011-03-01T02:19:14  <mseidl> yes
2011-03-01T02:19:32  <simonstewart> Then I'm not sure what's going on
2011-03-01T02:21:55  <mseidl> maybe i should make a threatening remark
2011-03-01T02:22:07  <simonstewart> It'd be nice if you didn't :)

2011-03-01T02:25:30  <mseidl> ebel: quick/dirty, not 100% accurate would be to take screen shots and compare teh md5sums
2011-03-01T02:25:36  <simonstewart> The OperaDriver also supports that stuff
2011-03-01T02:26:04  <mseidl> but you can encode the screen shots to a movie so you can see if something really failed
2011-03-01T02:26:08  <ebel> I'm hoping it could be done entirely in selenium ide so that it'll fit with the rest of our test flow

2011-03-01T05:46:12  <balou> i've been trying to get selenium grid2 to work for me  from the latest checkout for the past few days.
2011-03-01T05:46:38  <balou> does anyone know if its meant to be in some working state?
2011-03-01T05:47:09  <balou> it works when i restrict it to one browser at a time, when i try multiple concurrent browsers, it attempts it, but basically fails
2011-03-01T05:47:41  <balou> the tests run, but then throw : java.lang.IllegalStateException: Invalid use of SingleClientConnManager: connection still allocated.
2011-03-01T05:48:13  <simonstewart> The tests still pass as well as they used to
2011-03-01T05:48:18  <simonstewart> But I've not done more than pull it into trunk

2011-03-01T05:51:29  <simonstewart> You should be able to just start up the Hub

2011-03-01T06:26:58  <adamgoucher> correct; one at a time
2011-03-01T06:27:18  <jarib> so it's likely a lot of people who are not really interested in the topic will be there :)

2011-03-01T06:35:29  <jarib> adamgoucher: ah, sounds nice
2011-03-01T06:35:48  <adamgoucher> it means you likely have a synchronization problem that only happens when you make the server work
2011-03-01T06:35:58  <adamgoucher> or that you have dependencies between scripts

This may sound like a bit of a silly question, but is there a 'friendly' way to move an additional project I've added to the WebDriver solution (WebDriver.sln) into the cpp directory? It was created on the project root and I see that the rest of the projects in this solution sit under cpp

2011-03-01T06:47:35  <jimevans> eranm: not silly at all; it's non-obvious. the way i do it is to remove the project from the solution within VS, copy or move the files in the file system, then re-add the project using Add > Existing Project...

2011-03-01T06:58:34  <Rich_Morin> jarib, et al - I take it that you folks are talking about http://www.seleniumconf.com/ - might you be interested in speaking at (say) an SFRuby meeting?
2011-03-01T06:59:07  <jarib> eranm: probably a bit expensive.. apart from the conference days i'm paying for the hotel myself
2011-03-01T07:00:32  <Rich_Morin> SF has a lot of commercial hotels that cater to business travelers on a budget. It also has some vary nice B&B's, etc.
2011-03-01T07:00:33  <eranm> jarib, I see.  When I'm in SF I'm staying with a friend, so I don't have any other recommendations...
2011-03-01T07:00:45  <jarib> Rich_Morin: maybe... or just attend one? :)
2011-03-01T07:00:48  <mister_m> adamgoucher: what do you mean dependencies between scripts
2011-03-01T07:01:24  <adamgoucher> mister_m: data is set in one script that screws up the execution of another. intentionally or accidently
2011-03-01T07:01:45  <Rich_Morin> jarib: problem is, there don't tend to be many meetups at the ends and beginnings of months. so, we might have to pull something together.
2011-03-01T07:02:31  <jimevans> jarib: actually, a quick reservation check at hilton.com shows a better rate than the conference hotel, particularly if you prepay.

2011-03-01T07:02:54  <Rich_Morin> jarib: There are three major Ruby and/or Rails meetups in the bay area: SF, East Bay, and Silicon Valley
2011-03-01T07:03:25  <jarib> jimevans: huh, i got rates around $250-300 when i checked
2011-03-01T07:03:57  <jarib> wasn't the conference hotel < $150 ?
2011-03-01T07:04:12  <jarib> perhaps it has to do with the dates i put in.
2011-03-01T07:04:37  <jimevans> jarib: could be.

2011-03-01T07:47:49  <jimevans> extracting it from a jar (or from a resource in a .NET assembly) into the temp directory is likely to set off virus scanners everywhere if it's an .exe...

2011-03-01T08:16:31  <jarib> right. but they're not a star alliance member, hmm.
2011-03-01T08:16:34  <ato> I'm going by Lufthansa, but that's via Münich.
2011-03-01T08:16:38  <simonstewart> antlong: I'm surprised you're doing implicit waits client-side
2011-03-01T08:17:07  <antlong> simonstewart, it makes more sense. you have a lot more control over it then.
2011-03-01T08:17:11  <jarib> virgin does seem to have the cheapest direct flight though
2011-03-01T08:17:15  <simonstewart> And you've changed the license

2011-03-01T08:18:44  <antlong> simonstewart, not sure who i shouldve asked. people dont tend to get back to me ;)
2011-03-01T08:19:07  <simonstewart> Emailing selenium-developers asking to change the license would be polite
2011-03-01T08:19:13  <antlong> simonstewart, in all honesty though, i only changed it for the time being so it wouldnt get committed with me getting credit since thats happened before
2011-03-01T08:20:04  <jarib> AutomatedTester: yeah, i think i'll do that as well. when do you leave for SF?

2011-03-01T08:22:38  <simonstewart> It'd be good to meet up
2011-03-01T08:22:55  <balou> so i've changed my implementation from JUnit to TestNG  (which went real well)  in the hope that the grid2 stuff would work better with it

2011-03-01T08:24:20  <antlong> simonstewart, you should think about modifying the 1.x line though, i added some extremely useful functionality
2011-03-01T08:24:24  <simonstewart> The integration with other libraries sounds interesting
2011-03-01T08:24:52  <simonstewart> How are you planning on making it work?
2011-03-01T08:24:54  <antlong> simonstewart, switching your session to any other active session, adding/viewing headers, killing sessions
2011-03-01T08:25:12  <simonstewart> the session switching stuff sounds interesting

2011-03-01T08:28:01  <antlong> simonstewart, this should demostrate what it does: http://d.pr/OI5r
2011-03-01T08:28:10  <jimevans> simonstewart: ooo, fun.
2011-03-01T08:28:30  <simonstewart> So it's substituting the session id that the client holds
2011-03-01T08:28:56  <antlong> simonstewart, in essence, but it could be a session created anywhere at anytime.
2011-03-01T08:29:40  <antlong> kill_session is intelligent, it will switch your current session to the one you want to kill if its different than your current, kill it, then switch back to your initial session.
2011-03-01T08:29:57  <simonstewart> How often are you using this stuff?
2011-03-01T08:30:15  <antlong> every day
2011-03-01T08:30:25  <simonstewart> I've just never had a need for it
2011-03-01T08:30:41  <simonstewart> though it would be nice to be able to hook the IE driver on to an existing IE instance
2011-03-01T08:31:07  <antlong> its really useful when you want to edit a portion of a site, and check the results somewhere else
2011-03-01T08:31:22  <antlong> like if you were editing a user profile, and in the other session youre running tests that make sure what you entered show up
2011-03-01T08:31:41  <simonstewart> Why not just keep two selenium references?
2011-03-01T08:32:39  <antlong> you can, but if the session you were trying to use was launched outside of your current interpreter, you wouldnt be able to do much
2011-03-01T08:33:07  * simonstewart thinks
2011-03-01T08:34:08  <antlong> it basically lets you attach to a previously opened session and reuse it, and not need to instantiate a new session in the current interpreter
2011-03-01T08:34:20  <simonstewart> sure
2011-03-01T08:34:23  <simonstewart> I got the idea
2011-03-01T08:34:42  <simonstewart> I'm iterating through the cases I'm familiar with for a time when someone would use it
2011-03-01T08:34:55  <antlong> its very useful for debugging.
2011-03-01T08:35:04  <simonstewart> hmmm....
2011-03-01T08:35:13  <antlong> you can just run a firefox with firebug, and hook in to that session whenever you need to debug
2011-03-01T08:35:14  <Rich_Morin> jarib: If you don't have a ton of baggage, consider taking BART from SFO into the city.  While you're here, consider visiting the Computer History Museum and the Cable Car Museum (the most interesting part, to me, is the infrastructure).
2011-03-01T08:35:15  <simonstewart> Heh: what do you know. The tests found a bug
2011-03-01T08:35:21  <jimevans> simonstewart: the native code of the IE driver is architected to allow attaching to an existing instance. the webdriver api doesn't have any method for doing so, though (yet).
2011-03-01T08:35:37  <antlong> what i do, is use on_error to connect to that profile, so i can manually debug
2011-03-01T08:35:53  <antlong> on_error is quite useful also.
2011-03-01T08:37:49  <simonstewart> Aye. Dan Fabulich wanted on_error handling added
2011-03-01T08:37:59  <antlong> its pretty amazing
2011-03-01T08:38:13  <antlong> any function of method (or even class) will be initialized on error
2011-03-01T08:38:25  <simonstewart> eh?
2011-03-01T08:38:58  <antlong> so if you have a function, that you want ran on errors, like taking screenshots, you do: selenium.on_error = your_func
2011-03-01T08:39:06  <antlong> and whenever theres a selenium error, your_func will be ran
2011-03-01T08:39:44  <simonstewart> does that work on all browsers?
2011-03-01T08:40:06  <antlong> sure, it doesnt run at that level

2011-03-01T08:41:00  <antlong> it runs at pythons level, so you can do 'anything' you want.
2011-03-01T08:41:17  <simonstewart> not hooked into the server?
2011-03-01T08:41:19  <jarib> Rich_Morin: thanks! much appreciated
2011-03-01T08:41:40  <antlong> simonstewart, no because whether something is a pass or a fail is determined by the bindings
2011-03-01T08:41:51  <simonstewart> ahhh
2011-03-01T08:42:02  <simonstewart> I thought you were talking about the JS onerror event
2011-03-01T08:42:04  <antlong> simonstewart, theres a line of code in the do_command that checks the response and determines that the result is (pass or fail)
2011-03-01T08:42:06  <antlong> haha, no
2011-03-01T08:42:24  <antlong> its an on_error method, that will run any code you want when selenium encounters an exception/error

2011-03-01T09:30:15  <jarib> Rich_Morin: all of the WebDriver API is accessible through the Driver and Element classes, so those are good starting points
2011-03-01T09:30:41  <jarib> Rich_Morin: anything in particular you're looking for?
2011-03-01T09:31:40  *** txwikinger2 has joined #selenium
2011-03-01T09:32:20  <Rich_Morin> Well, as an example, I'm trying to log in to Google's 3D Warehouse, using the standard Google login page.  I've been able to do this with Mechanize; I want to do the same things in Se.
2011-03-01T09:33:54  <Rich_Morin> So, I look in the Se docs (eg, http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-core/1.0/reference.html) and see all sorts of stuff about selectors, accessors, assertions, etc.  I then look in the selenium-webdriver API pages and see a bazillion API calls.  SOme example code would let me see how to pull them together.
2011-03-01T09:34:25  <jarib> Rich_Morin: did you look at the wiki page?
2011-03-01T09:34:28  *** jqp has quit IRC
2011-03-01T09:34:38  <jarib> that + the API docs for Driver/Element should give you what you need
2011-03-01T09:35:31  <Rich_Morin> AFAICT, http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RubyBindings has one tiny example.
2011-03-01T09:36:10  <Rich_Morin> maybe I should scan github...
2011-03-01T09:37:03  *** AutomatedTester_ has joined #selenium

2011-03-01T09:37:15  <antlong> theres atleast 20 examples
2011-03-01T09:37:25  <jarib> Rich_Morin: that example + the API docs for Driver/Element should get you through logging into google

2011-03-01T09:46:46  <adamgoucher> add the ids? :)
2011-03-01T09:50:05  <Rich_Morin> jarib: I don't see how to get into edit mode in the wiki - is this restricted?

2011-03-01T11:14:21  <Rich_Morin> I'm running into a peculiar difference in the way Firefox acts manually and under Se. - http://pastie.org/1621789
2011-03-01T11:23:21  <jarib> Rich_Morin: interesting
2011-03-01T11:23:30  <antlong> jarib, why is that interesting
2011-03-01T11:24:22  *** Putr is now known as Putr|Away
2011-03-01T11:24:45  <antlong> his profile probably has that protocol handler set
2011-03-01T11:25:01  <jarib> right
2011-03-01T11:25:34  <antlong> fix: use custom profile with that set in it
2011-03-01T11:25:54  <jarib> Rich_Morin: launch Firefox normally and check about:config for a network.protocol-handler preference for skp://, then see "Tweaking Firefox preferences" on the RubyBindings wiki page
2011-03-01T11:26:17  <antlong> might be a little more than setting the preference though
2011-03-01T11:26:43  <antlong> well, rather than just setting network.protocol-handler.external.skp
2011-03-01T11:28:37  <antlong> you would have to set it in applications (or content) too
2011-03-01T11:29:11  <jarib> aha

2011-03-01T11:30:38  *** epall has quit IRC
2011-03-01T11:30:53  <jarib> Rich_Morin: the clue is knowing that webdriver uses a clean profile for each Driver instance, which you can tweak programatically
2011-03-01T11:31:09  <jarib> alternatively, you can pass in a profile name and it will use that as a template
2011-03-01T11:31:10  <Rich_Morin> cool
2011-03-01T11:31:25  <jarib> so to just use your default profile, :profile => "default" should work
2011-03-01T11:31:51  <jarib> i think that's on the wiki as well
2011-03-01T11:31:58  <antlong> Rich_Morin, pro tip: always make sure your environments are the same
2011-03-01T11:32:15  <jarib> i'm off, ttyl
2011-03-01T11:32:17  <antlong> jarib, that wiki is da bomb
2011-03-01T11:34:38  <Rich_Morin> antlong: In this case, I'm going to be handing off this script to other folks who may have different profiles, so I think I should set up the profile specifically for se.
2011-03-01T11:35:14  <antlong> ;) "fix: use custom profile with that set in it"
2011-03-01T11:36:05  <Rich_Morin> However, looking in my Firefox about:config, I see nothing for network.protocol-handler.external.skp
2011-03-01T11:36:11  <antlong> yeah...
2011-03-01T11:36:34  <Rich_Morin> in fact, nothing matches a Filter of skp
2011-03-01T11:36:43  <antlong> right
2011-03-01T11:36:49  <antlong> why do you think that is
2011-03-01T11:38:12  <Rich_Morin> This is all new territory for me, so I don't know what to think.  However, _something_ is keeping my manual Firefox session from complaining, but not keeping the Se-driven session from complaining.
2011-03-01T11:39:02  <antlong> well, when youre manually performing the actions that use the skp stuff, what happens
2011-03-01T11:39:35  <Rich_Morin> The only difference I see is the lack of an alert
2011-03-01T11:39:50  <antlong> how are you interacting with the object
2011-03-01T11:41:01  <Rich_Morin> http://pastie.org/1621893
2011-03-01T11:41:18  <antlong> ok
2011-03-01T11:41:25  <antlong> open your normal firefox
2011-03-01T11:41:32  <jarib> Rich_Morin: perhaps try with :profile => "default" to make sure the profile is actually the problem
2011-03-01T11:41:43  <jarib> off for real now, good luck :)
2011-03-01T11:45:55  <Rich_Morin> driver    = Selenium::WebDriver.for(app_sym, :profile => 'default') <- causes the run to crash
2011-03-01T11:47:03  <Rich_Morin> I pasted the stack trace into http://pastie.org/1621893
2011-03-01T11:47:20  <antlong> `WebDriverError': Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with (Selenium::WebDriver::Error::ElementNotDisplayedError)
2011-03-01T11:47:20  <antlong> 	from [remote server] file:///private/var/folders/Z+/Z+Y9-aoGFDWlQ8QUs-dUjk+++TM/-Tmp-/webdriver-rb-profilecopy20110301-95511-odc7wt/extensions/fxdriver@googlecode.com/resource/modules/atoms.js:9280:in `'
2011-03-01T11:47:30  <antlong> `WebDriverError': Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with
2011-03-01T11:47:41  <antlong> you gotta read these things
2011-03-01T11:48:54  <Rich_Morin> I see that, and I see that the line of code in question is "driver.find_element(:id => 'Email' ).send_keys(email)".  However, I'm not sure why adding the profile would cause that to be different.
2011-03-01T11:49:30  <antlong> thats for you to figure out. look at your addons perhaps.
2011-03-01T11:49:34  <Rich_Morin> perhaps my default profile is doing somehting that changes what is visible
2011-03-01T11:50:05  <Rich_Morin> I think it may make more sense to start from a clear profile.

2011-03-01T14:17:34  *** santiycr has joined #selenium
2011-03-01T14:18:00  <XCulver> the profile folder its looking for changes
2011-03-01T14:18:33  <antlong> why does it change
2011-03-01T14:18:40  <antlong> are you calling start more than once
2011-03-01T14:19:45  <XCulver> i dont know why it changes, if i had to guess i would say its a temp location, so maybe everytime chrome is started or restarted?
2011-03-01T14:20:18  <XCulver> i only start a new driver if one isn't open
2011-03-01T14:20:26  <XCulver> but i close the browser after every test
2011-03-01T14:20:35  <XCulver> so i'm opening a new one every test
2011-03-01T14:21:45  <XCulver> I tried it with no chrome browsers open before i start the testrun
2011-03-01T14:21:46  <XCulver> same result
2011-03-01T14:26:22  <antlong> well a profile directory is made when you call start i believe
2011-03-01T14:27:24  <antlong> does this happen with firefox?
2011-03-01T14:27:34  <XCulver> no, firefox and ie are fine

2011-03-01T14:32:26  <XCulver> why is selenium creating the profile folder?  i'm just guessing it is due to the webdriver name in the folder name
2011-03-01T14:32:50  <antlong> "webdriver{0}-chrome.profile"
2011-03-01T14:32:56  <XCulver> yes
2011-03-01T14:33:12  <XCulver> and there are thousands of webdriver{0}libs folders
2011-03-01T14:33:31  <antlong> dont worry about that
2011-03-01T14:33:44  <antlong> they are cleared out when temp is cleared
2011-03-01T14:33:50  <XCulver> kk
2011-03-01T14:33:59  <XCulver> and i have about 6 chrome.profile folders
2011-03-01T14:38:54  <antlong> hmn
2011-03-01T14:39:08  <antlong> try:
2011-03-01T14:39:14  <antlong> passing in profile="default"
2011-03-01T14:39:20  <antlong> or whatever the .net syntax is

2011-03-01T18:06:05  <ian_mac> so am I correct in supposing that the stuff at http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fjava%2Fclient%2Fsrc%2Fcom is the old selenium stuff and the stuff at http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fjava%2Fclient%2Fsrc%2Forg%2Fopenqa%2Fselenium is the new webdriver stuff?

2011-03-01T20:37:39  <Rich_Morin> I'm getting occasional errors from selenium-webdriver when using find_element the first time on a Chrome page.  It appears that the page hasn't filled in yet.  Is there a Best Practice for dealing with this?
2011-03-01T20:40:48  *** santiycr has joined #selenium
2011-03-01T20:41:11  <Rich_Morin> I tried doing sleep(1) after "driver.navigate.to url", but that didn't solve the problem.
2011-03-01T20:44:12  *** santiycr has quit IRC
2011-03-01T20:45:07  <Rich_Morin> In fact, even sleep(3) doesn't consistently prevent a problem.
