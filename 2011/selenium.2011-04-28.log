2011-04-28T04:26:03  <mashiara> define experience, I have used it a bit with python

2011-04-28T04:48:05  <pythonirc101> mashiara: how is webdriver looking from python? why not use the sel.ide+python?
2011-04-28T04:50:14  <mashiara> webdriver is pretty handy to use from python, I don't quite understand what you mean "sel.ide+python" if it's not using the ide to capture and then use the "save as python".
2011-04-28T04:50:57  <mashiara> I sometimes use the ide to get ideas on how to handle certain flows but always end up rewriting the test code
2011-04-28T04:57:33  <pythonirc101> mashiara: my problem is that i would like to use the webdriver interface
2011-04-28T04:57:44  <pythonirc101> but i right now just create the ide- save as python code, and then run it from python
2011-04-28T04:57:55  <pythonirc101> i thought that the webdriver code has to be written by hand, isnt it?
2011-04-28T04:58:36  <mashiara> not neccessarily, the ide code-generators are moving to use webdriver AFAIUnderstand
2011-04-28T04:59:03  <mashiara> anyway it's very easy to use
2011-04-28T04:59:39  <pythonirc101> you mean the webdriver is easy to use? how do you fill forms (login etc) using webdriver?

2011-04-28T05:02:32  <mashiara> not runnable as-is however
2011-04-28T05:03:17  <mashiara> since the common module is not there, but for this case it does not matter
2011-04-28T05:04:08  <mashiara> but basically you use the find_element_by_xxx methods to get the element instances and then use the interaction methods within
2011-04-28T05:04:09  <mashiara> Â¨
2011-04-28T05:04:39  <mashiara> and of course since it's python you can just chain the find method with the interaction method

2011-04-28T06:21:00  <jimevans> apparently, i finally got jeff atwood's (from StackExchange) attention
2011-04-28T06:21:40  <RossPatterson> On the SE site, or directly?  Got a link to share?
2011-04-28T06:22:17  <jimevans> no, i was an ass^h^h^h^h^h^h^h deliberately provocative on twitter.
2011-04-28T06:22:25  <RossPatterson> LOL
2011-04-28T06:24:17  <jimevans> I used the word "extortion" to describe how the stackexchange community treated the selenium proposal.
2011-04-28T06:24:46  <jimevans> in retrospect, the word was ill-chosen in that it doesn't describe the situation, but i wanted to provoke a reaction
2011-04-28T06:24:54  <RossPatterson> I just saw.  Should be interesting, although I expect he's used to being called out from time to time.

2011-04-28T11:43:41  <jarib> cool
2011-04-28T11:44:05  <jarib> weird, i've never seen it hang like that
2011-04-28T11:44:06  <epall> I'll try implementing the low-level socket stuff
2011-04-28T11:44:16  <jarib> thanks
2011-04-28T11:44:54  <epall> I suspect it's a strange interaction of Firefox, Darwin, and Ruby

2011-04-28T11:46:14  <epall> looking forward to the blog series
2011-04-28T11:46:33  <andytinkham> Thanks! What's the tool you're alpha testing?
2011-04-28T11:47:16  <epall> I'm building something akin to a page object model
2011-04-28T11:47:46  <epall> to get people writing tests at a higher level of abstraction

2011-04-28T11:48:49  <andytinkham> Sounds interesting. I'd like to take a look at some point. Not sure we'd be a good alpha test site (since I've built a lot of abstractions already), but I'd definitely like to see more
2011-04-28T11:49:04  <epall> sure, will add you to the list!
2011-04-28T11:49:07  <andytinkham> Thanks!
2011-04-28T11:51:10  <epall> I'm hoping to make this an example others can port from
2011-04-28T11:51:27  <epall> so I suspect there'll be some things you can borrow :)
2011-04-28T11:52:45  <epall> jarib: setting SO_RCVTIMO and SO_SNDTIMEO didn't help
2011-04-28T11:52:57  <epall> it's actually a lot worse now...54% failure rate
2011-04-28T11:53:05  <jarib> oO
2011-04-28T11:53:47  <jarib> do you have a script to test it? i can try with the same ruby here
2011-04-28T11:54:00  <epall> yea, will send script in a  sec
2011-04-28T11:54:13  <epall> so here's the change I made to SocketPoller: http://pastie.org/1844475

2011-04-28T12:01:34  <epall> but doesn't completely fix the problem
2011-04-28T12:02:29  <epall> scratch that, doesn't help at all
2011-04-28T12:02:31  <jarib> i've got a 0% failure rate on 1.9.2. i'll try 1.8.7-p330
2011-04-28T12:02:31  <epall> going to try connect_nonblock
2011-04-28T12:05:44  <epall> nonblock is even worse

2011-04-28T12:06:32  <jarib> sounds like you're close to figuring out the root cause :)
2011-04-28T12:08:43  <jarib> i got 2 failures (2.67%) with -p330
2011-04-28T12:08:43  *** udesh has quit IRC
2011-04-28T12:11:36  <epall> alright, think I might have a solution
2011-04-28T12:11:41  <epall> root cause? hell no. Reasonable patch? Maybe :)
2011-04-28T12:12:11  <epall> at what point are we going to be able to give up on 1.8?
2011-04-28T12:12:20  <epall> as a Ruby community, that is
2011-04-28T12:13:46  <jarib> good question
2011-04-28T12:14:29  <jarib> i have a feeling the problem may be socket contention
2011-04-28T12:14:49  <jarib> you never see this happen on the first iteration, right?
2011-04-28T12:16:15  <epall> I have seen it fail on the first iteration
2011-04-28T12:16:27  <epall> but that may have been right after I ran the command
2011-04-28T12:16:32  <epall> by contention you mean TIME_WAIT sockets?
2011-04-28T12:16:40  <epall> or whatever they're called..
2011-04-28T12:16:44  <jarib> yeah
2011-04-28T12:16:54  <epall> hm
2011-04-28T12:17:32  <epall> well I seem to have a working version of SocketPoller using connect_nonblock
2011-04-28T12:18:13  <jarib> ok?
2011-04-28T12:18:23  <epall> :)
2011-04-28T12:18:52  <epall> http://pastie.org/1844575
2011-04-28T12:19:08  <epall> I'm also getting the Safe Mode warning occasionally
2011-04-28T12:19:22  <epall> could it be that @driver.quit isn't really finishing?
2011-04-28T12:19:48  <jarib> it waits until firefox (i.e. the server) dies
2011-04-28T12:19:59  <jarib> but the socket may be left in TIME_WAIT
2011-04-28T12:20:03  <epall> right
2011-04-28T12:20:16  <epall> with the additional information of the "Safe Mode" popup appearing occasionally
2011-04-28T12:20:26  <epall> I'm inclined to believe that waiting for the process to die isn't quite enough
2011-04-28T12:20:27  *** admc1 has quit IRC
2011-04-28T12:20:39  <jarib> yeah, i get the Safe Mode too
2011-04-28T12:20:44  <jarib> no idea what that's about
2011-04-28T12:20:53  <epall> I'll be a sleep after quit fixes everything
2011-04-28T12:20:54  <jarib> simon tells me he never has seen it
2011-04-28T12:21:23  <jarib> i think he's lying :)
2011-04-28T12:21:24  <epall> simon says a lot of things
2011-04-28T12:21:24  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-04-28T12:22:00  <jarib> epall: a sleep probably fixes it, though i'd rather investigate a little more than slow everyone down ;)
2011-04-28T12:22:07  <epall> yea, I agree
2011-04-28T12:22:13  <epall> I'm going to try the sleep to get more information
2011-04-28T12:27:08  <jarib> nah, i don't think this is it
2011-04-28T12:27:19  <epall> sleep 1 didn't fix things, so I'm inclined to believe that the Safe Mode thing is unrelated
2011-04-28T12:28:08  <jarib> i reverted to the current trunk (your Timeout fix) and did an `lsof -i TCP:#{@port}` in the rescue
2011-04-28T12:28:18  <jarib> and firefox is definitely listening
2011-04-28T12:31:26  <epall> hm
2011-04-28T12:31:54  <epall> "sleep 5" after quit didn't work
2011-04-28T12:32:16  <epall> so I'm inclined to commit this fix and move on
2011-04-28T12:32:40  <jarib> aye
2011-04-28T12:33:03  <epall> thanks for your help!
2011-04-28T12:33:31  <jarib> likewise
