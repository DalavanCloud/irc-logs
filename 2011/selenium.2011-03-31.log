2011-03-31T06:48:27  <dbolser> can the href= point to a web URL instead of a file?
2011-03-31T06:49:17  <dbolser> I'm guesing selenium will ignore the headers and skip to the test table of those Selenium scripts
2011-03-31T06:49:58  *** toseter has quit IRC
2011-03-31T06:50:38  <dbolser> also, suppose I want to verify the overall structure of a page, and run that test every time I load a page (for whatever reason) can I nest tests like that?
2011-03-31T06:51:15  <dbolser> I figure since I'm loading page x, I may as well test the structure of page x conforms to what I expect

2011-03-31T07:54:49  <RossPatterson> Kai...: The problem is most likely on the line before the one that's failing.  Something has happened that caused a problem, and the problem was detected on the line you cited.
2011-03-31T07:55:50  <KaibutsuX1> hmm, the previous line is verifyText //a[@href='mailto:info@xxxx.com]
2011-03-31T07:56:03  <KaibutsuX1> and it always does this in IE, never FF, maybe it's the colon that's screwing with IE
2011-03-31T07:56:10  <RossPatterson> I'm a long-time coder, got my start doing assembler on mainframes and have some code in the Linux kernel interrupt handlers.  My current employer saw the value in having a professional programmer in QA.
2011-03-31T07:56:23  <KaibutsuX1> I have noticed IE never behaves the same way as FF when evaluating special chaarcters
2011-03-31T07:56:24  <RossPatterson> Ooh ... it's IE!
2011-03-31T07:56:35  <RossPatterson> IE in Selenium 1 has some "challenges".
2011-03-31T07:56:52  <KaibutsuX1> yeah, i have wildcards everywhere in my verifyAttributes for the IE specific test
2011-03-31T07:57:28  <RossPatterson> Hang on ... that XPath is wrong.  You're missing a closing apostrophe before the right-bracket.
2011-03-31T07:57:47  <KaibutsuX1> i typed it, my bad
2011-03-31T07:57:52  <RossPatterson> Unless that's just a chat typo :-)
2011-03-31T07:57:55  <RossPatterson> OK
2011-03-31T07:58:46  <KaibutsuX1> maybe I'll rework this test case and see if I can reduce the number of errors
2011-03-31T07:58:50  <KaibutsuX1> thanks for the pointers
2011-03-31T07:59:03  <RossPatterson> Annnnnyway, IE presents some problems for Selenium.  It likes to throw "Permission denied" errors that are very hard to diagnose.  Those sometimes can produce the message you cited.
2011-03-31T08:00:11  <KaibutsuX1> luckily I havent had any more than this single error instance in IE, but the ssl certificate thing is extremely annoying
2011-03-31T08:00:23  <KaibutsuX1> I can't test in chrome or opera either because of it

2011-03-31T11:12:05  <jimevans> s'up?
2011-03-31T11:12:54  <AutomatedTester> whats your feeling on GetCookie as a name?
2011-03-31T11:14:03  <jimevans> that one, i'm okay with. It's going to be on a CookieJar object, and takes a name argument, so it's pretty descriptive to me.
2011-03-31T11:14:56  <jimevans> the only way I'd consider renaming it "GetCookieWithName" is if there were other ways to retrieve a cookie
2011-03-31T11:17:00  <jimevans> of course, i'm looking at the current .NET implementation, and i see GetCookieNamed(), so I'm not exactly consistent here, am I?
2011-03-31T11:17:46  <AutomatedTester> :D

2011-03-31T11:18:34  <AutomatedTester> bbiab
2011-03-31T11:18:58  <jimevans> looking at the .NET implementation, the GetCookies() method should probably be the Cookies property, and GetCookieNamed() and DeleteCookieNamed() should probably drop the "Named".
2011-03-31T11:19:22  <AutomatedTester> thats what I was thinking for python
2011-03-31T11:19:30  <AutomatedTester> but then can see the value of not gong that way
2011-03-31T11:19:35  <AutomatedTester> <- torn
2011-03-31T11:20:08  <jimevans> it'd probably be worth formalizing in the IDL.

2011-03-31T11:40:25  *** NemesisD has joined #selenium
2011-03-31T11:40:49  <NemesisD> hi all. i'm using selenium in ruby for tests and it seems like ff4 isn't supported. it just launches the browser and does nothing. any ideas?
2011-03-31T11:42:07  <andytinkham> NemesisD: I haven't tried it myself yet, but I know ff4 support was a recent addition to the feature set (released last week, I think). What version of Selenium are you using?
2011-03-31T11:42:14  *** dhackner has joined #selenium
2011-03-31T11:43:16  <jimevans> QAguy: hi.
2011-03-31T11:43:45  <NemesisD> andytinkham: i've got 2 gems in this project, Selenium 1.1.14 and selenium-client 1.2.18. much to my dismay, these appear to be the most recent versions on rubygems
2011-03-31T11:43:52  <QAguy> jimevans. Hope you are well. Wanted to ask you, I think I found a bug with IE9 and selenium 2 bug not sure if its a know issue or not
2011-03-31T11:43:59  <jimevans> go ahead.
2011-03-31T11:44:17  <QAguy> I downloaded the latest version of selenium-webdriver (0.1.4)
2011-03-31T11:44:44  <QAguy> When I try to do driver.find_element(:something, 'blah').click()
2011-03-31T11:44:51  <andytinkham> Hmmm, those are Selenium 1 gems, I think. I haven't worked with those. (I'm using Selenium 2 - the gem name is selenium-webdriver but it's still in beta). Sorry, I'm not going to have much insight to offer
2011-03-31T11:44:52  <QAguy> it doesn't work in IE9 but does in IE9
2011-03-31T11:45:26  <QAguy> if I change the code to be driver.execute_script("window.jQuery('blah').click()")
2011-03-31T11:45:32  <QAguy> it works in both IE8 and IE9
2011-03-31T11:45:56  <jimevans> you're using jquery on the site under test?
2011-03-31T11:46:01  <QAguy> yes
2011-03-31T11:46:17  <jimevans> what happens if you remove jquery? can you find the element then?
2011-03-31T11:46:50  <QAguy> jimevans: you mean remove jquery from the site?
2011-03-31T11:46:58  <QAguy> i.e. remove the plugin
2011-03-31T11:47:36  <jimevans> i mean remove the references to jquery.
2011-03-31T11:47:41  <jimevans> let me tell you why i ask.
2011-03-31T11:47:46  <QAguy> k
2011-03-31T11:47:47  <antlong> whats this in lamemans terms? WebDriverException: CSSRule com.steadystate.css.dom.CSSCharsetRuleImpl is not yet supported.
2011-03-31T11:48:06  <NemesisD> andytinkham: do you think selenium-webdriver is likely to be a drop-in replacement? what "Selenium" gem are you using?
2011-03-31T11:48:18  <jimevans> QAguy: we find elements in almost all browsers using javascript.
2011-03-31T11:48:33  <QAguy> yes
2011-03-31T11:49:02  <jimevans> the same javascript (theoretically) is executed no matter what browser you're using.
2011-03-31T11:49:17  <jimevans> however, we minify that javascript using the google closure compiler.
2011-03-31T11:49:28  <QAguy> ok
2011-03-31T11:49:46  <jimevans> i've seen some reports recently that some .findelement calls fail on ie8 and below
2011-03-31T11:50:00  *** stubbsd has joined #selenium
2011-03-31T11:50:05  <NemesisD> our selenium setup is kinda handwavy, i know we use Selenium, selenium-client and webrat. kind of at the mercy of webrat to make the correct selenium calls i presume
2011-03-31T11:50:14  <jimevans> but the commonality between people reporting those problems all seem to be using jquery.
2011-03-31T11:50:30  <QAguy> Ahhhh
2011-03-31T11:50:44  <jimevans> i don't test any sites that use jquery. i don't know jquery.
2011-03-31T11:50:58  <andytinkham> NemesisD: I know that Selenium 2 and Selenium 1 are using different APIs. I know that some effort has been spent to ease the transition, but it's been long enough since I've used Se1 that I don't have a sense of what's supported for the transition. My Selenium work has been starting from scratch with Se2, so I've never had to deal with transitioning
2011-03-31T11:51:07  <jimevans> it would be interesting to see if we could narrow down the conflict was, in fact, with jquery.
2011-03-31T11:51:13  <QAguy> Ah I see
2011-03-31T11:51:16  <QAguy> I could consult with our front end dev and invesigate that then get back to you.
2011-03-31T11:51:31  <QAguy> Let me see if I can get you some more info
2011-03-31T11:51:38  <jimevans> the webdriver javascript code likely does have to change, but it would be a good data point to have to further troubleshoot the issue.
2011-03-31T11:51:54  <andytinkham> NemesisD: I haven't used WebRat either, unfortunately, so I'm not sure. I just have one Selenium gem installed - 'selenium-webdriver'. Currently I have version 0.1.4 (which corresponds to Se2.0b3)
2011-03-31T11:52:27  <QAguy> jimevans: Ok let me see what I can find out. I'll get back to you in a little while. Thanks for your time. :)
2011-03-31T11:52:34  <NemesisD> andytinkham: so are you using capybara like all the cool kids then?

2011-03-31T11:53:36  <andytinkham> NemesisD: My suite uses Cucumber at the top level, some in-house built ruby code and selenium for browser interactions
2011-03-31T11:57:28  <andytinkham> NemesisD: I'm actually curious as to what WebRat or Capybara would bring to the table for me. I'm not testing a Rails app, and I haven't perceived a need to look closely at them yet. What benefit do they provide?

2011-03-31T12:20:45  <NemesisD> andytinkham: they provide a dsl that maps to browser actions. as much as possible we try to use webrat without selenium. it pretends like its a browser, hits the site and makes assertions
2011-03-31T12:21:18  <NemesisD> in the cases where theres lots of ajax that can't be avoided, webrat has a driver for selenium, so our syntax doesn't change but its controlling selenium instead

2011-03-31T15:05:30  <simonstewart> with the htmlunit driver?
2011-03-31T15:05:34  <antlong> yeah
2011-03-31T15:05:41  <simonstewart> Nope, but I've seen it choke on similar things
2011-03-31T15:05:50  <antlong> is there any workaround?
2011-03-31T15:06:08  <simonstewart> Turn off JS
2011-03-31T15:06:19  <antlong> heh, cant do that. im testing GWT.
2011-03-31T15:06:26  <simonstewart> Then don't use htmlunit
2011-03-31T15:06:32  <simonstewart> Or file a bug with them
2011-03-31T15:06:43  <simonstewart> Marc is normally pretty good at providing feedback and support
2011-03-31T15:07:05  <antlong> ok, thanks

2011-03-31T15:13:27  <simonstewart> yo!
2011-03-31T15:13:37  <krosenvold_> I just sent a mail to the ml because you weren't around
2011-03-31T15:13:47  <simonstewart> 'sup?
2011-03-31T15:14:04  <krosenvold_> Memory leak, the mail should be in your mailbox about --> now <--
2011-03-31T15:15:41  <simonstewart> Ooohhh.. that's nasty
2011-03-31T15:15:46  <krosenvold_> +1
2011-03-31T15:16:01  <krosenvold_> Any ideas ?
2011-03-31T15:16:07  <simonstewart> Off the top of my head?
2011-03-31T15:16:12  <krosenvold_> Yup ;)
2011-03-31T15:16:18  <simonstewart> Put the hack back in with a comment explaining why it's there
2011-03-31T15:16:28  <krosenvold_> It seems to be a bit rough wrt the dependencies
2011-03-31T15:16:36  <simonstewart> ?
2011-03-31T15:16:53  <krosenvold_> Which is where I ended up in some trouble, since I don't understand the build ;=
2011-03-31T15:17:00  <krosenvold_> Or at least not well enough
2011-03-31T15:17:07  <simonstewart> What do you need?
2011-03-31T15:17:23  <krosenvold_> I need to make "LoggingMAnager" visible to "DeleteSession" ;)
2011-03-31T15:17:44  <simonstewart> hang on.
2011-03-31T15:17:56  <simonstewart> Will need to start terminal and intellij
2011-03-31T15:18:31  <simonstewart> You've read the docs on the wiki about crazy fun?
2011-03-31T15:18:34  <simonstewart> :wiki CrazyFun
2011-03-31T15:18:35  <selbot2> 1: BuildReadme: A list of Questions that need to be answered after someone checks out the source code. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/BuildReadme
2011-03-31T15:18:35  <selbot2> (+ 1 more)
2011-03-31T15:19:02  <krosenvold_> simonstewart: I'm trying to get the "fun" into that, honestly
2011-03-31T15:19:39  <simonstewart> So, the nearest "build.desc" file to the logging manager is the one in java/server/src/org/openqa/seleniu/server/build.desc
2011-03-31T15:19:59  <krosenvold_> Yup, seen that ;)
2011-03-31T15:20:10  <simonstewart> So there's a target called "//java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/server:base"
2011-03-31T15:20:25  <simonstewart> cos the "log/*.java" stuff is in the "base" java_library declared in that.
2011-03-31T15:21:04  <krosenvold_> So I add base to that and I'm off ?
2011-03-31T15:21:21  <simonstewart> So, in theory, all you need to do is add a reference to that rule to the deps section of the build.desc in /java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/server/build.desc
2011-03-31T15:21:23  <simonstewart> Yeah
2011-03-31T15:21:30  <krosenvold_> Seems simple enough
2011-03-31T15:21:42  <simonstewart> You basically need to find out the name of the rule that would build the jar containing the file
2011-03-31T15:22:00  <simonstewart> and then add that to the "deps" of the thing you're attempting to add the dependency to
2011-03-31T15:23:33  <krosenvold_> I think it's circular....?
2011-03-31T15:23:41  <simonstewart> Then things get more interesting
2011-03-31T15:23:57  <krosenvold_> Which is where I sort of gave up ;)
2011-03-31T15:24:01  <simonstewart> Yeah. That's going to be a bitch
2011-03-31T15:24:13  <simonstewart> Because the logging manager has a ref to the selenium server
2011-03-31T15:24:16  * krosenvold_ started thinking of reflection
2011-03-31T15:24:32  <krosenvold_> Actually
2011-03-31T15:24:42  <simonstewart> It may be just the kick we need to clean this stuff up
2011-03-31T15:24:43  <krosenvold_> I thought maybe the LoggingManager should be moved somewhere else
2011-03-31T15:24:50  *** freynaud has quit IRC
2011-03-31T15:24:53  <krosenvold_> But didnæt know where
2011-03-31T15:25:41  <simonstewart> Heh. There's no need for the loggingmanager to have a reference to the server
2011-03-31T15:25:47  <simonstewart> It's just used for getting the logger
2011-03-31T15:26:32  <simonstewart> You can replace those references with the string of the server

2011-03-31T15:27:58  <simonstewart> like that
2011-03-31T15:28:22  <simonstewart> Now to find out what the "REmoteControlConfiguration" is used for.
2011-03-31T15:28:57  <krosenvold_> Quite a lot of stuff ;)
2011-03-31T15:29:04  <simonstewart> OK. So that has no deps on the selenium server
2011-03-31T15:29:44  <simonstewart> So we might be able to extract a logging jar
2011-03-31T15:31:21  <simonstewart> One moment please, caller
2011-03-31T15:32:19  <simonstewart> Almost there, I think
2011-03-31T15:32:26  <krosenvold_> Oooo
2011-03-31T15:32:40  <simonstewart> OK. So the last thing left is "DEFAULT_JETTY_THREADS"
2011-03-31T15:33:15  <simonstewart> Which I will hard code
2011-03-31T15:33:25  <simonstewart> for now
2011-03-31T15:33:40  <krosenvold_> 512 is a *lot*, and its hardcoded there too
2011-03-31T15:34:01  <simonstewart> Let's not worry about that right now
2011-03-31T15:34:08  <simonstewart> (though you're right)
2011-03-31T15:34:16  <krosenvold_> I'm not worrying. I have 12 cores
2011-03-31T15:34:58  <simonstewart> OK

2011-03-31T15:36:58  <simonstewart> like that
2011-03-31T15:37:15  <simonstewart> And now you should be able to refer to the LoggingManager in the DeleteSession handler

2011-03-31T15:45:16  <plightbo> simonstewart: around?
2011-03-31T15:45:39  <plightbo> simonstewart: what happened to FirefoxProfile.getProfileDir()? why'd we remove it
2011-03-31T15:49:50  <plightbo> the way the new FirefoxProfile stuff works seems to make it really hard just to find out where the anonymous profile got created
2011-03-31T15:49:53  <plightbo> what was the point?
2011-03-31T15:50:02  <jarib> to make the FirefoxProfile instance reusable
2011-03-31T15:50:04  <plightbo> hmph... serves me right for now paying attention :)
2011-03-31T15:50:15  <plightbo> jarib: fair enough, but how do I get the one in use?
2011-03-31T15:51:07  <simonstewart> on phone with The Wife
2011-03-31T15:51:31  <jarib> plightbo: check layoutOnDisk()
2011-03-31T15:51:43  <plightbo> layoutOnDisk generates a new anonymous profile each time
2011-03-31T15:52:03  <jarib> correct
2011-03-31T15:52:05  <plightbo> what happens is that NewProfileExtensionConnection calls layoutOnDisk() and then uses that
2011-03-31T15:52:09  <plightbo> but if you call it again you get a new folder
2011-03-31T15:52:15  <jarib> what's your high-level goal?
2011-03-31T15:52:29  <plightbo> i want the profile dir being used by the running firefox instance
2011-03-31T15:52:51  <jarib> that's not high-level enough :) why?
2011-03-31T15:52:56  <plightbo> there doesn't appear to be any field that stores it in NewProfileExtensionConnection, FirefoxDriver, FirefoxBinary, or FirefoxProfile
2011-03-31T15:53:02  <plightbo> uggg
2011-03-31T15:53:05  <plightbo> trust me, I need it :)
2011-03-31T15:53:18  <plightbo> i'm installing Firebug, FireStarter, YSlow, netExport, and a couple custom extensions
2011-03-31T15:53:26  <plightbo> and one of those extensions writes to the profile
2011-03-31T15:53:31  <plightbo> and I need to read the data it writes to
2011-03-31T15:53:47  <plightbo> gotta run - meeting time. I'll be back tonight to bitch and complain hehe
2011-03-31T15:53:56  <plightbo> j/k of course
2011-03-31T15:54:21  <jarib> :)
2011-03-31T15:56:34  <jarib> at least for netExport, the output dir is configurable
2011-03-31T15:57:13  <jarib> but in ruby we do actually store the result of layout_on_disk, in the Firefox::Launcher instance
2011-03-31T15:57:35  <jarib> so it's doable in ruby, not sure about java
2011-03-31T15:59:30  <plightbo> jarib: i know, but i have other things going on too :)
2011-03-31T15:59:36  <plightbo> i'll fix up Java, no biggie
2011-03-31T15:59:39  <plightbo> i'm outta here bye
