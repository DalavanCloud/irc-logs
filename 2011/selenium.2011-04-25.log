2011-04-25T04:01:57  <mrbichel> Hi I am using selenium from python and I am having trouble debugging my script, is there something I can call to be able to see live what is going on in the spawned browser? Right now it is all too fast.

2011-04-25T05:32:26  <mrbichel> only the mouse down and mouse up seems to be emulated correctly not the dragging
2011-04-25T05:43:45  <mrbichel> I found a solution, a mouse_move_at in between makes it work.

2011-04-25T07:33:28  <QAguy> jarib: Hey hoping you can help me with something
2011-04-25T07:33:53  <jarib> we'll see :)
2011-04-25T07:34:00  <QAguy> :)
2011-04-25T07:34:11  <QAguy> I am trying to access an iframe that we are enbedding into a partners website
2011-04-25T07:34:26  <QAguy> I am using this code: @browser.switch_to.frame("Content")
2011-04-25T07:34:36  <QAguy> But it can't find the fame.
2011-04-25T07:34:55  <QAguy> Its an iframe within a frame so I'm think that might be the issue but not sure
2011-04-25T07:35:04  <QAguy> thinking*
2011-04-25T07:35:41  <QAguy> I also added a sleep to ensure that the frame is loaded before checking
2011-04-25T07:36:33  <QAguy> Not sure what I need to do to access this iframe. Hoped you might have an idea
2011-04-25T07:37:24  <jarib> QAguy: try switch_to.frame(browser.find_element(:id, 'Content'))
2011-04-25T07:37:33  <jarib> or :name etc
2011-04-25T07:37:45  <jarib> switch_to.frame can take an element instance
2011-04-25T07:37:46  <QAguy> k trying that now.

2011-04-25T08:19:02  <QAguy> jarib: kinda what I thought. But which one do I start with?
2011-04-25T08:19:50  <jarib> id="Main" is the top level frame
2011-04-25T08:20:06  <QAguy> Ok base on that let me see if I can get this to work.

2011-04-25T08:33:22  *** KaibutsuX has joined #selenium
2011-04-25T08:34:15  <KaibutsuX> is this a valid xpath expression? //div[@class='test'][2] (the second div on the page with a class of 'test'?
2011-04-25T08:37:42  <jarib> KaibutsuX: yes
2011-04-25T08:38:10  <QAguy> jarib: Got it working. thanks for the help. If your ever in NYC I owe you a beer. :)

2011-04-25T08:38:47  <QAguy> :)
2011-04-25T08:39:39  <KaibutsuX> any idea why it fails to find the second one?
2011-04-25T08:39:46  <KaibutsuX> [error] Element //div[@class='prod_price'][2] not found
2011-04-25T08:39:50  <KaibutsuX> it finds the first one fine
2011-04-25T08:40:24  <jarib> in some browsers (IE?) xpaths may be 0-indexed
2011-04-25T08:40:41  <KaibutsuX> this is only FF
2011-04-25T08:41:09  <KaibutsuX> its a table with structure like td>div>div>div@class=prod_price
2011-04-25T08:41:20  <KaibutsuX> and there are three tds like this
2011-04-25T08:41:27  <KaibutsuX> it finds 1 fine, but 2 says not found
2011-04-25T08:41:52  <jarib> what tool are you using? RC, webdriver, IDE?
2011-04-25T08:43:09  <jarib> i think your xpath only works if the divs are siblings
2011-04-25T08:43:29  <KaibutsuX> ide
2011-04-25T08:43:37  <ato> KaibutsuX: Use CSS?
2011-04-25T08:43:47  <ato> div.test::nth(2) or something.
2011-04-25T08:44:00  <RossPatterson> jarib: IE indexes XPaths based at 1.  I'm not aware of any that use 0 (that would be an error).
2011-04-25T08:44:26  <KaibutsuX> ie5+ indexes at 0 according to wc3schools
2011-04-25T08:44:37  <RossPatterson> KaibutsuX: Try: xpath=(//div[@class='prod_price'])[2]
2011-04-25T08:45:14  <KaibutsuX> wow
2011-04-25T08:45:17  <KaibutsuX> why does that work?
2011-04-25T08:45:18  <jarib> yeah, that should work
2011-04-25T08:46:15  <jarib> because xpath sucks :)
2011-04-25T08:46:33  <KaibutsuX> ha
2011-04-25T08:46:58  <RossPatterson> It works because "//div[@class='prod_price"] results in a node-set, and you can index a node-set.  The parens are required becuase XPath interprets "a[b][c]" as "a[b and c]".
2011-04-25T08:47:02  <KaibutsuX> so that will run the expression on all nodes and return an array of them regardless of their level
2011-04-25T08:47:14  <KaibutsuX> ah ok
2011-04-25T08:47:26  <RossPatterson> XPath sucks differently from C-based languages, which train programmers to think a specific way about "[..]".
2011-04-25T08:47:46  <KaibutsuX> thanks a lot
2011-04-25T08:47:58  <RossPatterson> The "xpath=" is also required because Selenium assumes it when a locator starts with "//", but not when it starts with "(".
2011-04-25T08:48:58  <KaibutsuX> ok cool
2011-04-25T08:49:06  <RossPatterson> Yes, that's what it will do.
2011-04-25T08:50:59  <RossPatterson> KaibutsuX: W3Schools has a lot of old information that was once correct.  When it says "Note: IE5 and later has implemented that [0] should be the first node, but according to the W3C standard it should have been [1]!!", it should say "IE5 and 6".  Modern IEs are correct.
2011-04-25T08:52:15  <KaibutsuX> oh ok
2011-04-25T08:52:17  <KaibutsuX> well good

2011-04-25T09:46:04  <jimevans> dawagner: there's not much logging there (it's on my todo list), and what logging there is requires a rebuild from C++.
2011-04-25T09:46:22  <jimevans> However, IEDriverServer.cpp, line 10 should get you there.

2011-04-25T09:48:21  <jimevans> ah.
2011-04-25T09:48:22  <dawagner> From the C++ it seems to be getting an error code 12 then an error code 13
2011-04-25T09:48:50  <jimevans> i think i changed that recently. may have broken it.
2011-04-25T09:48:52  <dawagner> But the 13 is being created from the 12 (same error message, even if I change the error message where the 12 is created)

2011-04-25T11:12:13  <dawagner> By the way jimevans, I came across http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriverInternals the other day, which probably either needs deleting or updating :)
2011-04-25T11:12:17  <dawagner> Yeah, we should
2011-04-25T11:12:18  <jimevans> ok, i don't know anything about the htmlunit test failures, except that eranm just added those tests about 10 days ago.
2011-04-25T11:12:57  <dawagner> I heard mention somewhere on a list that you can sed over a few pieces of our Rakefile and tasks to turn a halt-on-failure flag from true to false...
2011-04-25T11:13:08  <jimevans> dawagner: yes, it needs updating. i just got around to updating the InternetExplorerDriver page to document the correct IE config.
2011-04-25T11:13:14  <jarib> dawagner: looking into it
2011-04-25T11:14:00  <jarib> omg
2011-04-25T11:14:17  <jarib> simon's ruby style isn't that great
2011-04-25T11:14:26  <jarib> THE HORROR
2011-04-25T11:14:29  <dawagner> You're surprised? :P
2011-04-25T11:14:31  <jimevans> heh. understatement.
2011-04-25T11:14:35  <jarib> MY EYES
2011-04-25T11:14:39  <jarib> MYYY EEEEYYYES
2011-04-25T11:14:40  <jimevans> of course, I'm one to talk...
2011-04-25T11:16:15  <dawagner> AFAIR the first Ruby he ever wrote was hacking together crazyfun v1 in a weekend?
2011-04-25T11:16:43  <jarib> hehe, ok
2011-04-25T11:20:37  <ivog> Hey, i'm looking at how to make screenshots while using a RemoteWebdriver in c#, it looks like in java there's an Augmenter class, is that how it's supposed to be done in c# as well?
2011-04-25T11:21:25  <ivog> or should i extend remotedriver and make it implement ITakesScreenshot?
2011-04-25T11:23:13  *** sjmikem has joined #selenium
2011-04-25T11:24:58  <jimevans> ivog: I'd create a subclass.
2011-04-25T11:25:55  <jimevans> You could pretty much steal the code from InternetExplorerDriver.cs (or FirefoxDriver.cs or ChromeDriver.cs).

2011-04-25T11:30:42  *** toseter1 has quit IRC
2011-04-25T11:30:46  <jimevans> dawagner: i think the failure in the remote tests is a problem with the remote server.

2011-04-25T11:33:42  *** jleyba has quit IRC
2011-04-25T11:34:57  <jimevans> looking at the remote server log, it doesn't look like it knows how to handle InvalidElementStateException ("Exception thrown java.lang.reflect.UndeclaredThrowableException")
2011-04-25T11:37:02  <jimevans> then again, I could be wrong...

2011-04-25T11:48:09  <jimevans> dawagner: I think the IE problem you're seeing is in ErrorCodes.java, line 121.
2011-04-25T11:48:52  <jimevans> the toStatusCode() method is looking for an UnsupportedOperationException, and instead it's getting an InvalidElementStateException, which falls through to the else case (UNHANDLED_ERROR)
