2011-07-25T01:46:12  <Ajay> Thanks i will do that
2011-07-25T01:47:34  <dawagner> I'm applying the imports patch now :) thanks for taking the time1

2011-07-25T02:29:11  <ato> eranm: Yes (-:
2011-07-25T02:30:00  <eranm> Good, I was hoping to get your advice about rendering issues.  Basically, it's in this page: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/server/test/org/openqa/selenium/tests/html/test_click_page1.html
2011-07-25T02:31:04  <eranm> There's an element with the id 'enclosedImage' which is a child element of a link element with the id 'linkWithEnclosedImage'
2011-07-25T02:31:47  <eranm> calling getBoundingClientRect for the element 'enclosedImage' returns a rectangle with the size of the image
2011-07-25T02:32:35  <eranm> but calling getBoundingClientRect on the element 'linkWithEnclosedImage' returns a rectangle that is positioned immediately below the image (the 'enclosedImage' element). It has the width of the image but a height of only 17 pixels or so
2011-07-25T02:33:22  <eranm> Now, the reason it matters, is that I was using getBoundingClientRect to get the location of the element for native events - in case a user provides an element and offset within this element to move the mouse to.
2011-07-25T02:34:09  <eranm> Now, if the user is trying to move the mouse into the middle of the image *but* provides the linkWithEnclosedImage element instead, I will not get the image coordinates - but a rectangle below it, so that will not work
2011-07-25T02:34:59  <eranm> So I'm wondering why the bounding client rectangle for the link element itself does not contain the image but is below it.

2011-07-25T06:34:04  <ruel> good morning
2011-07-25T06:34:31  <ruel> I ran into a bug over the weekend using the firefoxdriver where it is unable to click on a link
2011-07-25T06:34:53  <ruel> the issue *i think* may be related to #1020
2011-07-25T06:34:55  <selbot2>  open/new Element click sometimes has no effect if the element is a wrapped inline element - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1020
2011-07-25T06:35:17  <ruel> with the difference being the a element in the case wraps an image
2011-07-25T06:37:01  <ruel> actually, its just an input with an onlcik handler
2011-07-25T06:37:43  <ruel> the general question i have is could this be related to the before mentioned bug, or does it sound like something different?

2011-07-25T06:42:49  <simonstewart> ruel: eranm ran into the same thing
2011-07-25T06:43:15  <dawagner> Any tips for debugging the ChromeDriver, particularly on mac?
2011-07-25T06:43:25  <simonstewart> What are you trying to do?
2011-07-25T06:43:34  <simonstewart> You could always compile it and hook in a debugger via xcode
2011-07-25T06:43:47  <ruel> ok.   I've got a simple workaround for now, just wanted to see if I needed to open a seperate issue
2011-07-25T06:44:03  <dawagner> Ugh xcode...
2011-07-25T06:44:06  <eranm> ruel, is it the same case as described in the bug or are you getting a hold of  the link element that's the parent of the img element?
2011-07-25T06:44:19  <dawagner> Does one need to check out the whole chromium source to compile the chromedriver, or is there a useful subset?
2011-07-25T06:44:29  <simonstewart> no idea
2011-07-25T06:44:35  <simonstewart> But it hooks in at quite a low level
2011-07-25T06:44:49  <ruel> @eranm, its not exactly as described in the bug.   In this case, I'm just trying to click on an img with an onscript handler
2011-07-25T06:45:02  <ruel> i can get the img, and perform the click, although nothing happens
2011-07-25T06:45:09  <ruel> if i fire the onscript manually
2011-07-25T06:45:13  <ruel> it works
2011-07-25T06:45:33  <ruel> i cannot do we.sendSendKeys("\n");
2011-07-25T06:45:46  <ruel> and maximizing the size of the page (via javascript)
2011-07-25T06:45:49  <dawagner> Ok, I'll have a poke :) If compiling selenium provides me with a lap-warmer, I hate to think what compiling chromium does
2011-07-25T06:45:51  <ruel> also has no effect
2011-07-25T06:46:31  *** ssims has joined #selenium
2011-07-25T06:47:38  <eranm> ruel, it's possible the handler has not finished running by the time click() returns
2011-07-25T06:49:12  <ruel> interesting.
2011-07-25T06:49:23  <ruel> is there way to put a wait in
2011-07-25T06:49:27  <ruel> to test that theory?
2011-07-25T06:50:27  <ruel> i originally thought that i was possibly executing the click prior to the page fully loading, but some wait statments debunked that theory

2011-07-25T09:44:10  <ner0x> Well, I assuming it would wait until elements text is "example" and die if it didn't see it after implicit wait time.
2011-07-25T09:44:31  <simonstewart> They only work for presence or visibility
2011-07-25T09:44:32  *** sdimkov has joined #selenium
2011-07-25T09:44:42  <simonstewart> For something like waiting for text, you need explicit waits
2011-07-25T09:45:03  <ner0x> Explain?
2011-07-25T09:45:23  *** QAGuy is now known as DanQA
2011-07-25T09:45:36  <ner0x> So I can do an is_visible() wait and then check the text.
2011-07-25T09:46:04  <simonstewart> I'll talk about the java bindings
2011-07-25T09:46:10  <simonstewart> and assume that the perl ones are similar
2011-07-25T09:46:27  <simonstewart> in all bindings, the implicit waits always wait for the presence of an element in the DOM
2011-07-25T09:46:37  <simonstewart> But presence does not necessarily mean visibility
2011-07-25T09:46:58  <simonstewart> For the interactions (click, type) they also wait (at least in the firefox driver) for visibility
2011-07-25T09:47:15  <ner0x> so if I wait for the is_displayed it should work.
2011-07-25T09:47:27  <simonstewart> That's not an implicit wait, though
2011-07-25T09:47:38  <simonstewart> That's an explicit one: where it's spelled out in your code

2011-07-25T09:56:55  <ner0x> I spoke to the guys developing the Selenium::Remote::Driver perl bindings and was told he has a Test::Selenium::Remote::Driver setup already but it was better to keep the testing logic in the test rather than a module. I'm starting to disagree.

2011-07-25T12:20:43  <simonstewart> It's consistant
2011-07-25T12:24:11  <simonstewart> Done.
2011-07-25T12:24:14  <ArmEagle> so, I'm wondering.. Will Selenium 2* get any support for PHP (back) included? I'm new to all this. But it seemed to have it included in 1*.
2011-07-25T12:24:22  <simonstewart> Ladies and gentlemen, Selenium 2.2.0 is now live
2011-07-25T12:24:28  <ArmEagle> I've seen those 2 'libraries'. But those don't seem to be very complete
2011-07-25T12:24:30  <simonstewart> Thank you for being as awesome as ever :)
2011-07-25T12:24:45  <simonstewart> ArmEage: we need enthusiastic PHP developers to help us
2011-07-25T12:24:50  <ArmEagle> :P
2011-07-25T12:24:52  <simonstewart> None have come forward so far
2011-07-25T12:24:54  <simonstewart> :(
2011-07-25T12:25:24  <Ajay> Yay my first patches are live :)
2011-07-25T12:25:41  <simonstewart> Grats Ajay!
2011-07-25T12:25:43  <ArmEagle> I tried to make sense of even just running selenium (2) last week, but it didn't seem so simple (until I foudn the grid wiki page :)
2011-07-25T12:25:44  <tunabum> simonstewart: thanks! i'll update the hq downloads page :)
2011-07-25T12:26:01  <simonstewart> You're a star tunabum. Appreciate that a lot

2011-07-25T13:18:00  <ato> What?
2011-07-25T13:20:07  *** Briareos1 has quit IRC
2011-07-25T13:20:28  <dawagner> And why on earth has it put something on my non-system disk, which means it needs to spin up to actually launch opera!
2011-07-25T13:21:03  <dawagner> ato: I installed opera on my Windows box with defaults, and now all my HTML files open in Opera by default :p my own fault for trusting defaults!
2011-07-25T13:22:17  <ato> I don't know anything about Windows, sorry.
2011-07-25T13:22:38  <ato> I'm not sure what you mean by putting something on a non-system disk, is that a bug?
2011-07-25T13:23:31  *** adamgoucher has joined #selenium
2011-07-25T13:25:01  <dawagner> I have a c:\ and s:\ drive - the c:\ is an SSD, the s:\ isn't, and spins down when it's idle
2011-07-25T13:25:27  <dawagner> The idle disk had to spin up (taking 10~20 seconds) before opera could launch, because it needed to access probably some config files on that drive
2011-07-25T13:25:48  <ato> If you installed it on S:\ that makes sense?
2011-07-25T13:26:04  <dawagner> Opera itself isn't on that drive
2011-07-25T13:26:10  <ato> Is Windows?
2011-07-25T13:26:23  <ato> Sorry, I mean your home directory?
2011-07-25T13:26:44  <dawagner> My homedir is also on my SSD
2011-07-25T13:26:53  <dawagner> I'll poke around and try to find the files later :) My food has just arrived
2011-07-25T13:27:09  <ato> Do you know which files it's trying to access?  Are the other browsers having the same behaviour?
2011-07-25T13:27:23  <ato> Okay!  Let me know if you figure out what it is; we can probably fix it. (-:
2011-07-25T13:35:35  <cgoldberg> is there a way to disable client-side javascript in Firefox WebDriver?

2011-07-25T15:20:03  <gordolio> denzil: if you're wondering which jar file to download... get the selenium2 jar file.
2011-07-25T15:21:10  <gordolio> it supports both selenium1 and selenium2 methods.
2011-07-25T15:22:48  *** RSchulzB has joined #selenium
2011-07-25T15:24:33  <gordolio> then I would try experimenting with selenium2... if you have problems with it... post them here.
