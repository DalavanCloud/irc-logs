2011-06-20T03:13:19  <Mayank> Hi all, I have a HTML object tag -> <object> that loads from a specified data url. When I inspect element - there is no HTML code visible inside the DOM of <object>, though it is visible on the page. I am not able to findElement which is inside the object tag. I have used implicit waits, but Selenium tests wait for ever. The code that I am using to find the element is ->http://pastebin.com/6sqNy3uQ , the object tag with the code is - http://pastebin.com/r7u

2011-06-20T03:13:53  <barancev> Mayank: I've yesterday looked at the DOM -- yes, object is a black box
2011-06-20T03:14:06  <barancev> it has no children
2011-06-20T03:14:21  <Mayank> barancev: yeah! any how I can proceed?
2011-06-20T03:14:36  <Mayank> barancev: and thanks for looking into it.
2011-06-20T03:15:24  <barancev> you can try to get its attribule that contains a link and open it in a new page
2011-06-20T03:16:14  <Mayank> But that will be opening the page in the new window - outside Moodle, would not lead to any result.

2011-06-20T03:18:31  <Mayank> any idea if is it already there in Selenium?
2011-06-20T03:18:46  <Mayank> stupid question - obviously no!

2011-06-20T03:30:57  <simonstewart> I spent some hacking time at the weekend on the setSelected code
2011-06-20T03:31:05  <simonstewart> Need to do some tests, but it's looking good :)
2011-06-20T03:31:18  <barancev> ave, simonstewart!
2011-06-20T03:31:23  <simonstewart> Ave!
2011-06-20T03:31:45  <barancev> what about cleaning out setSelected before rc3?
2011-06-20T03:31:51  <freynaud> simonstewart: question about remoteDriver.getCapabilities.
2011-06-20T03:32:01  <simonstewart> We always do one release with a method deprecated before deleting
2011-06-20T03:32:06  <simonstewart> Go
2011-06-20T03:32:13  <freynaud> is it dropping the extra non standard capabilities on purpose
2011-06-20T03:32:36  <freynaud> if I have capability.setCap("A",B"), startn abd driver.getCapabilities
2011-06-20T03:32:37  <simonstewart> the returned value should be whatever the browser returns
2011-06-20T03:32:55  <simonstewart> That is: the accurately reflect the browser, rather than the desired capabilities
2011-06-20T03:32:56  <freynaud> it returns the version etc, but the extra stuff I've put sn't there
2011-06-20T03:33:03  <simonstewart> what like?
2011-06-20T03:33:07  <Mayank> simonstewart: Goodmorning! is it a good time to ask you about HTML object tag-> <object>,  that do not have any visible HTML code in the DOM, but the page is quite visible on the page.
2011-06-20T03:33:23  <simonstewart> Not a great time, but you can ask :)

2011-06-20T03:34:10  <freynaud> simonstewart: I'd like to use the desiredCapabilities for some of the grid variables. For instance the name of the machine where the test run
2011-06-20T03:34:21  <Mayank> as barancev said - "I've yesterday looked at the DOM -- yes, object is a black box"
2011-06-20T03:35:05  <simonstewart> The server should be returning whatever the browser sends back unmodified
2011-06-20T03:35:22  <freynaud> ok, so I'll need another way
2011-06-20T03:35:24  <simonstewart> You _should_ be able to intercept that either at the leaf node (preferable) or the grid hub
2011-06-20T03:35:24  <freynaud> thx
2011-06-20T03:36:00  <freynaud> I can. but on the way in I already have the request parsed
2011-06-20T03:36:08  <freynaud> not on the way out :)
2011-06-20T03:36:39  <simonstewart> You know it's pretty easy to override the mapping for a single command in the driver servlet....
2011-06-20T03:37:11  <freynaud> i'd like to keep a vanilla server
2011-06-20T03:37:25  <freynaud> maybe even remove the selfRegistering thing
2011-06-20T03:37:35  <simonstewart> k
2011-06-20T03:38:35  <ksinkar> i thought there is no server in selenium 2.0
2011-06-20T03:38:50  <simonstewart> You don't need one if everything runs on the same machine

2011-06-20T03:55:57  <simonstewart> :)
2011-06-20T03:56:35  <Mayank> simonstewart: Any lead on how I can read the elements inside an <object> tag? The elements are not visible inside the DOM, but the page does load as-if the elements are inside the DOM. Here is a quick screen shot of the situation - http://admissions.dce.edu/files/images/mayank/scorm_testing.jpg
2011-06-20T03:56:49  <ksinkar> instead of require "rubygems"; gem "selenium-webdriver"; i did require "selenium-webdriver"
2011-06-20T03:57:02  <Mayank> I want to read - "Status: Testing in progress...."
2011-06-20T03:57:25  <simonstewart> If you look at that screenshot, you can see that the browser is treating the object as opaque
2011-06-20T03:57:35  <simonstewart> It's not indicating that there's an additional DOM tree in there
2011-06-20T03:57:55  <simonstewart> If the browser's not going to expose the data, webdriver can't get hold of it
2011-06-20T03:58:11  <Mayank> yes, thats what the problem. So no way out of it?
2011-06-20T03:58:17  <simonstewart> not an easy one
2011-06-20T03:58:28  <simonstewart> You could get the data attribute and navigate to it directly
2011-06-20T04:00:39  <Mayank> simonstewart: like? Did not quite get it.
2011-06-20T04:02:49  <simonstewart> Find the object element, then call "getAttribute("data")"
2011-06-20T04:02:56  <Mayank> Oh you mean the data attribute of the object
2011-06-20T04:02:59  <simonstewart> that'll give you a URL you can pass to driver.get()
2011-06-20T04:03:02  <simonstewart> Right
2011-06-20T04:03:41  <Mayank> That will fail the test, as I need to test it inside Moodle. No use opening it outside moodle, any other way you can think of?
2011-06-20T04:04:06  <simonstewart> Off the top of my head? Nope
2011-06-20T04:04:23  <simonstewart> Other than, maybe, trying chrome and the new chromedriver

2011-06-20T04:32:51  <samitbadle> AutomatedTester: Not yet, still focusing exclusively on getting the formatters for webdriver out first.
2011-06-20T04:33:09  <AutomatedTester> samitbadle: ok but Fx5 is due tomorrow
2011-06-20T04:33:59  <samitbadle> AutomatedTester: I saw you discussing some issues with Selenium and Fx5. Are there any issues?
2011-06-20T04:34:15  <AutomatedTester> samitbadle: no, just bumping the version should do it
2011-06-20T04:34:35  <AutomatedTester> davehunt ran his tests against fx5, fx6 and fx7 and they worked
2011-06-20T04:34:39  <samitbadle> AutomatedTester: I know Dave's mozmill tests run fine.
2011-06-20T04:34:57  <AutomatedTester> my issues with Fx5 and webdriver are not related
2011-06-20T04:35:29  <samitbadle> AutomatedTester: So, we can just bump up and release v1.0.12 tomorrow. I will speak with Adam today.
2011-06-20T04:35:40  <AutomatedTester> samitbadle: in theory yup
2011-06-20T04:36:21  <samitbadle> AutomatedTester: We can always fix bugs when they show up.
2011-06-20T04:36:28  <AutomatedTester> samitbadle: exactly
2011-06-20T04:37:03  <samitbadle> AutomatedTester: Btw, can you recommend a good set of examples scripts in Python using webdriver?
2011-06-20T04:38:11  <AutomatedTester> samitbadle: only what is with http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium
2011-06-20T04:39:00  <samitbadle> AutomatedTester: How about the Mozilla tests? are they in Python and Webdriver?
2011-06-20T04:39:19  <AutomatedTester> there are a couple, we have a mixture
2011-06-20T04:39:28  <samitbadle> AutomatedTester: I recall you had a test day recently.
2011-06-20T04:39:35  <AutomatedTester> we did, that was Se1
2011-06-20T04:40:04  <AutomatedTester> unfortunately we use Grid so had to wait for our grid to be working with both
2011-06-20T04:40:19  <AutomatedTester> and since freynaud did all the hard work for me, I was willing to wait
2011-06-20T04:40:21  <samitbadle> AutomatedTester: Ah! Once I have the formatter in place, I will run it by you, if you have the time.
2011-06-20T04:47:01  <barancev> may be r12514 should fix 1637 too?

2011-06-20T05:21:32  <eranm> barancev, not yet, I've been looking at issues with the Python bindings which cannot be worked-around
2011-06-20T05:23:53  <wilhelm> simonstewart: Is there a canonical description of what the WebDriver API is and what problem it solves available anywhere? (c:
2011-06-20T05:24:01  * wilhelm is updating a certain W3C charter.
2011-06-20T05:24:07  <simonstewart> I can write one
2011-06-20T05:24:21  <simonstewart> The short version is that it's a browser automation API
2011-06-20T05:24:37  <simonstewart> Which also defines the problem it's trying to solve
2011-06-20T05:25:01  *** dmachi has joined #selenium
2011-06-20T05:25:05  <wilhelm> Indeed.
2011-06-20T05:25:22  <simonstewart> But I guess you'd like something more formal?
2011-06-20T05:25:28  <wilhelm> I'm trying to phrase something that would fit under section 1 here: http://www.w3.org/2011/05/testing-ig-charter.html
2011-06-20T05:26:27  <simonstewart> "an API to allow automated tests using browsers to be expressed in common programming languages"?
2011-06-20T05:26:32  <wilhelm> Something slightly more specific than "to specify and standardize common APIs for cross-browser automated testing", ideally.
2011-06-20T05:26:47  <simonstewart> I'll have a think
2011-06-20T05:26:57  * simonstewart puts on thinking cap
2011-06-20T05:27:11  <wilhelm> If we can lure in the API name here, that'd be good. (c:
2011-06-20T05:27:32  <wilhelm> (I'm not any good with this formal language. :)
2011-06-20T05:27:57  <simonstewart> "to standardize the webdriver APIs to allow them to be used to express tests for other standards where JS is not appropriate"?

2011-06-20T06:04:41  <AutomatedTester> :P
2011-06-20T06:05:00  <nirvdrum> The 16 GB RAM upgrade I need costs about $1,500.  It's not that cheap.
2011-06-20T06:05:01  <barancev> AutomatedTester: faster that chrome?
2011-06-20T06:05:16  <nirvdrum> Unfortunately :-(
2011-06-20T06:05:32  <simonstewart> nirvdrum: that's pretty damn expensive
2011-06-20T06:05:41  <AutomatedTester> barancev: the only thing that makes chrome faster, and this was in 4 to in my opinion is the browser start up
2011-06-20T06:05:56  <AutomatedTester> other than that they are they are on a par
2011-06-20T06:06:03  <samitbadle> Two hours and still not done with svn up :-(
2011-06-20T06:06:14  <nirvdrum> simonstewart: Apple caps off at 8GB in the MPBs.  OCW has an upgrade kit to 16 GB, but the 8 GB chips themselves are just expensive right now.

2011-06-20T09:48:13  <simonstewart> Of course, people who know the implementation details then start to rely on "css" meaning "sizzle", which is a Bad Thing To Do

2011-06-20T11:13:48  <adamgoucher> so before the uk kids go pumpkin, can someone point me to something (other than the source as it didnt help) that explains how the javascriptexecutor works in webdriver -- specifically about injecting the 3rd party js into the page (like, say, sizzle)
2011-06-20T11:14:16  <simonstewart> JavascriptExecutorTest
2011-06-20T11:14:40  <jarib> simonstewart: uh, does setSelected() work as before when selecting multiple options?
2011-06-20T11:14:49  <simonstewart> yes
2011-06-20T11:15:06  <simonstewart> adamgoucher: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/JavascriptExecutor.html
2011-06-20T11:15:31  <jarib> i couldn't see Keys.SINGLE_SELECT among the changes
2011-06-20T11:15:50  <simonstewart> Currently "setSelected" works the way it always has
2011-06-20T11:15:53  <simonstewart> (but using click)
2011-06-20T11:16:06  <jarib> oh, so click() doesn't work as it always has then? ;)
2011-06-20T11:16:41  * jarib shakes fist
2011-06-20T11:16:45  <simonstewart> Well, it works as people expect when clicking on options
2011-06-20T11:18:25  <jarib> so in a multi-select, we now can't change from a single selected option to another?
2011-06-20T11:18:41  <simonstewart> you should be able to
2011-06-20T11:18:46  <simonstewart> just "click" on the first one
2011-06-20T11:18:50  <simonstewart> and then click on the second
2011-06-20T11:19:18  <jarib> ok, i may be misunderstanding the change then
2011-06-20T11:19:20  <jarib> i'll look closer
2011-06-20T11:19:24  <jarib> thanks

2011-06-20T11:21:11  <adamgoucher> simonstewart: so its not one call to inject, and then another to use, but one call with a blob of js that injects (if necessary) and then uses?
2011-06-20T11:21:21  <simonstewart> You can if you want
2011-06-20T11:21:30  <simonstewart> If you know that the page isn't reloading, you can use two calls
2011-06-20T11:22:24  <simonstewart> Right. Home.

2011-06-20T11:29:39  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: do you mean JS DOM lookups?
2011-06-20T11:30:01  <AutomatedTester> find_element is a DOM locators
2011-06-20T11:30:07  <adamgoucher> ya. in se-ide/rc there is a dom= locator strategy -- which ive never used
2011-06-20T11:30:28  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: use javascriptexecutor
2011-06-20T11:30:35  <AutomatedTester> it will return a webelement
2011-06-20T11:30:41  <AutomatedTester> we kind like that
2011-06-20T11:30:56  <adamgoucher> right. suspected as much.
2011-06-20T11:31:16  * adamgoucher will eventually have his brain catch the right gear for this
2011-06-20T11:33:08  <adamgoucher> so the locator conversion is css=some.pure.css -> find_by_css('some.pure.css') and dom=Sizzle(some sizzly css) -> javascriptexecutor.executescript('some sizzly css')
2011-06-20T11:33:12  <adamgoucher> (or similar)

2011-06-20T11:38:07  <adamgoucher> yes. which is what i was bugging simon for code on how to do. but i think its just 'standard' inject-remote-js-scripts code that gets stashed in a the code passed to executeScript

2011-06-20T11:38:41  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: it shouldnt
2011-06-20T11:38:51  <AutomatedTester> if its getting trashed thats a bug
2011-06-20T11:39:06  <AutomatedTester> and you need to give us a failing test
2011-06-20T11:40:11  <adamgoucher> this is this evening's rabbit hole -- but figured id try and get someone to say 'here is the code you need' before everyone went offline for the evening :)
2011-06-20T11:40:37  <AutomatedTester> executeScript('return Sizzle('some sizzly css');')
2011-06-20T11:40:53  <adamgoucher> ya, thats post injection
2011-06-20T11:41:08  <AutomatedTester> but i suspect the JS object returned isnt a plain old object
2011-06-20T11:41:59  <AutomatedTester> so wont be a webelement

2011-06-20T11:50:24  <dhackner> can somebody clarify something about the proper setup for me?
2011-06-20T11:51:08  <dhackner> selenium-java sits in my actual java code, server-standalone is on the server running grid, and selenium-server sits on each slave to act as a node?
2011-06-20T11:51:10  <dhackner> is that correct?
2011-06-20T11:51:51  <adamgoucher> sounds right i think
2011-06-20T11:51:53  *** jimevans has left #selenium
2011-06-20T11:52:02  <dhackner> and the libs all are on the actual java code
2011-06-20T11:52:20  <dhackner> so selenium-server and selenium-server-standalone is what difference?
2011-06-20T11:52:29  <dhackner> standalone doesnt need libs?
2011-06-20T11:52:34  <adamgoucher> ya
2011-06-20T11:52:40  <dhackner> oh
2011-06-20T11:52:45  <dhackner> so its either or
2011-06-20T11:52:46  <adamgoucher> i think i would just use it everyone
2011-06-20T11:53:00  <dhackner> server-standalone on all 3 machines?
2011-06-20T11:53:07  <adamgoucher> sure

2011-06-20T18:49:19  <rpk> why not just use xpath / id / name, etc ?
2011-06-20T18:49:33  <dhackner> css selector is stronger than all of those
2011-06-20T18:49:37  <dhackner> and faster than xpath

2011-06-20T18:52:19  <dhackner> rpk can you explain?
2011-06-20T18:52:25  <dhackner> like
2011-06-20T18:52:38  <rpk> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=24

2011-06-20T18:53:09  <dhackner> whats that w/webdriver?
2011-06-20T18:53:11  <rpk> theres native css selector support in everything except ie and old firefox
2011-06-20T18:53:14  <dhackner> ideally jquery is a better format
2011-06-20T18:53:18  <rpk> yes, its a rfe
2011-06-20T18:53:23  <rpk> (jquery selectors)
2011-06-20T18:53:26  <dhackner> doesn't appear to have css3 does it?
2011-06-20T18:53:45  <rpk> try BySelector
2011-06-20T18:53:53  <rpk> and no idea about css3 support
2011-06-20T18:54:11  <dhackner> By.cssSelector
2011-06-20T18:54:14  <dhackner> tried that
2011-06-20T18:54:21  <dhackner> se1 had css3 =-(
2011-06-20T18:56:11  <rpk> webdriver doesn't?
2011-06-20T18:56:19  <rpk> err, that wasn't a question
2011-06-20T18:56:31  <rpk> apparently it doesn't at the moment
2011-06-20T18:56:46  <rpk> I'm surprised theres no rfe for css3 selector support
2011-06-20T18:56:58  <rpk> I wonder if its a browser support issue.
2011-06-20T18:57:49  <rpk> gruio: native events might not be stable yet?
2011-06-20T18:58:48  <rpk> otherwise on your execution profile you should be able to do profile.setEnabledNativeEvents(true);

2011-06-20T19:00:23  <rpk> :)
2011-06-20T19:00:30  <dhackner> lol
2011-06-20T19:00:37  <dhackner> so i figured
2011-06-20T19:01:24  <dhackner> that means the selection is via a webdriver plugin vs. JS injection right?
2011-06-20T19:01:38  <rpk> yes
2011-06-20T19:02:15  <rpk> the window is set messages to the browser apis

2011-06-20T19:02:28  <rpk> wow, that was not english
2011-06-20T19:02:41  <dhackner> i thought by default webdriver uses native events?
2011-06-20T19:02:48  <rpk> yes, where supported
2011-06-20T19:02:57  <rpk> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/NativeEventsOnLinux
2011-06-20T19:02:59  <dhackner> or is it off because this is wrapped under the webdriverbackedselenium
2011-06-20T19:03:07  <rpk> that will give you a good idea of the issues involved
2011-06-20T19:03:33  <dhackner> linux and osx are grouped together i'm assuming?

2011-06-20T19:13:01  <dhackner> why do you ask?
2011-06-20T19:13:20  <rpk> dhackner: want to give feedback on my idea?
2011-06-20T19:13:29  <dhackner> sure, what is it?
2011-06-20T19:13:43  <rpk> some of the developers dislike it, but I know my particular employer would have use for it
2011-06-20T19:13:53  <dhackner> ok
2011-06-20T19:13:58  <rpk> I'd like to start an open source project that kind of accomplishes the same thing as bromine
2011-06-20T19:14:05  <rpk> do you know what bromine is?
2011-06-20T19:14:27  <dhackner> vaguely, I read about it a while ago
2011-06-20T19:14:44  <rpk> yeah, so basically it'd be a test managment style system
2011-06-20T19:14:51  <rpk> that wrapped on top of grid
2011-06-20T19:15:14  <dhackner> what is it accomplishing that you don't already get?
2011-06-20T19:15:50  <dhackner> is it just test reporting and management?
2011-06-20T19:15:50  <rpk> and had adapters for pulling tests from different test frameworks, submitting them in parallel, and adapters for pushing data back out into other collection systems
2011-06-20T19:16:13  <rpk> it would feature deployment of databases / application files (jar, .net to start)
2011-06-20T19:16:23  <rpk> to all of the clients in your grid
2011-06-20T19:16:39  <dhackner> sounds like it would contain CI-like functionality?
2011-06-20T19:16:51  <rpk> as well as managing the nodes / pushing out new SE grid standalone jars
2011-06-20T19:17:17  <rpk> sort of, except most people don't use their ci to push out a build and a new database schema to every worker in a grid
2011-06-20T19:17:40  <rpk> along with private builds that testers can submit to the grid, not just through ci
2011-06-20T19:17:46  <rpk> err, programmers really
2011-06-20T19:18:02  <rpk> and it would have an apache lic as opposed to a gpl one
2011-06-20T19:18:09  <dhackner> hmmm
2011-06-20T19:18:20  <dhackner> i've actually been fooling around with private builds lately
2011-06-20T19:18:38  <dhackner> though this se2 upgrade has blocked progress on that
2011-06-20T19:18:40  <rpk> anyways, the idea is this would all come out of the box for free
2011-06-20T19:18:47  <rpk> with very minimal setup effort
2011-06-20T19:19:03  <rpk> install the server, pick your adapters, deploy the initial client side app to the workers
2011-06-20T19:19:14  <dhackner> what do you mean when you say push out a build to each grid worker? build of what? your product?
2011-06-20T19:19:25  <rpk> yeah, say I have a war file, and its failing tests
2011-06-20T19:19:33  <rpk> as a developer, I make changes, and build my own war
2011-06-20T19:19:38  <dhackner> sure
2011-06-20T19:19:54  <rpk> I want to run the tests before I commit, so i just login, add my ear, and pick tests to run against it
2011-06-20T19:19:58  <dhackner> the way I'm currently handling that
2011-06-20T19:20:11  <dhackner> is to allow other devs to leverage our grid against their local
2011-06-20T19:20:12  <rpk> it gets deployed to a subset of the grid, and the suite is executed against that subset
2011-06-20T19:20:25  <dhackner> but thats basically the same idea
2011-06-20T19:20:54  <dhackner> it's pretty easy to do as-is though, wrt running via grid against an arbitrary server and logging results
2011-06-20T19:20:55  <rpk> yeah, problem with that is what happens when you have 300 devs pushing against a grid of machines, with CI doing tests as well
2011-06-20T19:21:01  <dhackner> right
2011-06-20T19:21:12  <dhackner> scale isn't yet a big obstacle for us
2011-06-20T19:21:21  <dhackner> but the grid queues
2011-06-20T19:21:23  <rpk> anyway, the point is it would all come prepackaged
2011-06-20T19:21:43  <rpk> their would be no need to have every medium size selenium user reimplement the same thing
2011-06-20T19:22:04  <dhackner> to make sure I'm with you
2011-06-20T19:22:10  <dhackner> you're trying to address the issue
2011-06-20T19:22:15  <dhackner> of pre-commit testing
2011-06-20T19:22:20  <dhackner> while still leveraging the grid
2011-06-20T19:22:21  <dhackner> yes?
2011-06-20T19:22:24  <rpk> yes
2011-06-20T19:22:43  <rpk> but also doing test management
2011-06-20T19:22:49  <rpk> and storing test history
2011-06-20T19:23:24  <dhackner> i see
2011-06-20T19:23:35  *** Binken has joined #selenium
2011-06-20T19:23:36  <dhackner> well, hudson could be leveraged to do that for you
2011-06-20T19:23:39  <dhackner> but
2011-06-20T19:23:47  <dhackner> if each dev wants their own specific issue
2011-06-20T19:23:53  <dhackner> to have its own build
2011-06-20T19:24:01  <rpk> not as nicely.  and what happens when you want results in say, BI
2011-06-20T19:24:03  <dhackner> jenkins would get a bit ugly as is
2011-06-20T19:24:20  <dhackner> jenkins plugins should handle that
2011-06-20T19:24:27  <dhackner> getting your results to the right format
2011-06-20T19:25:49  <rpk> hmm, I didn't know jenkins could push to clients like that
2011-06-20T19:25:56  <rpk> err, workers
2011-06-20T19:26:41  <dhackner> it still centralizes the build
2011-06-20T19:26:50  <dhackner> but jenkins can have slaves that are grid nodes
2011-06-20T19:27:00  <dhackner> or you can do as I have and just have it control the grid hub
2011-06-20T19:27:05  <dhackner> and be unaware of the nodes
2011-06-20T19:27:18  <dhackner> but it reads junit results and interpolates them etc.
2011-06-20T19:27:35  <dhackner> what was the main motivation behind this idea?
2011-06-20T19:27:52  <dhackner> just that its a pain to run pre-commit builds and your employer wants them?
2011-06-20T19:28:07  <rpk> test management actually
2011-06-20T19:28:31  <dhackner> hmm
2011-06-20T19:28:47  <rpk> that and deploying builds and new schema
2011-06-20T19:28:49  <rpk> to workers
2011-06-20T19:29:06  <dhackner> i have a few machines that each run diff. builds with their own schemas
2011-06-20T19:29:12  <dhackner> each has a job on jenkins tied to it
2011-06-20T19:29:25  <rpk> yeah, we do that too, with machines slaved to hudson
2011-06-20T19:29:26  <dhackner> but you can parameterize your jobs with what is called a matrix configuration
2011-06-20T19:29:36  *** Binken has quit IRC
2011-06-20T19:29:45  <rpk> we can't have the builds done on the same machines running tests though
2011-06-20T19:29:52  <dhackner> jenkins has no knowledge of the servers under test besides their names in the jobs
2011-06-20T19:29:56  <dhackner> right
2011-06-20T19:29:56  *** Binken has joined #selenium
2011-06-20T19:29:59  <dhackner> so my setup is
2011-06-20T19:30:01  <rpk> are full builds are a couple hours long
2011-06-20T19:30:03  <rpk> our^
2011-06-20T19:30:05  <dhackner> jenkins machine
2011-06-20T19:30:11  <dhackner> qa server(s)
2011-06-20T19:30:17  <dhackner> selenium nodes
2011-06-20T19:30:19  <dhackner> dev machines
2011-06-20T19:30:29  <dhackner> so a dev machine or jenkins machine hooks into the se grid
2011-06-20T19:30:34  <dhackner> (which lives on the jenkins machine)
2011-06-20T19:30:54  <dhackner> runs a build against the qa server via selenium nodes
2011-06-20T19:30:59  *** Binken has quit IRC
2011-06-20T19:31:29  *** Binken has joined #selenium
2011-06-20T19:31:40  <dhackner> the tests actually execute on the qa server
2011-06-20T19:31:45  <dhackner> against the qa server
2011-06-20T19:32:02  <dhackner> or on a dev machine against the qa server
2011-06-20T19:32:20  <rpk> don't you have test isolation problems?
2011-06-20T19:32:31  <dhackner> like what?
2011-06-20T19:32:40  <rpk> if each grid worker isn't running against a local db and application deployment?
2011-06-20T19:32:53  <rpk> one of your tests requires global setting a to be on
2011-06-20T19:32:57  <rpk> another requires it off
2011-06-20T19:33:25  <dhackner> make sure to not confuse grid workers with test executors
2011-06-20T19:33:38  <dhackner> the grid workers
2011-06-20T19:33:42  <dhackner> that I'm referring to
2011-06-20T19:33:48  <dhackner> are simply browsers executing commands
2011-06-20T19:33:55  <dhackner> and pointing to a certain server
2011-06-20T19:34:01  <rpk> yeah, executing commands against just 1 server
2011-06-20T19:34:05  <rpk> we couldn't have that
2011-06-20T19:34:15  <dhackner> against any server
2011-06-20T19:34:16  <rpk> what happens when you switch security / authentication mode?
2011-06-20T19:34:25  <dhackner> we handle the untrusted SSL
2011-06-20T19:34:27  <rpk> all your tests crash and burn
2011-06-20T19:34:37  <dhackner> and each server has multiple DB sandboxes
2011-06-20T19:34:48  *** davehunt has joined #selenium
2011-06-20T19:34:52  <dhackner> so many tests can run against the same codebase in parallel
2011-06-20T19:35:12  <dhackner> oh
2011-06-20T19:35:14  <dhackner> do you mean
2011-06-20T19:35:22  <dhackner> how do we handle certain global server variables?
2011-06-20T19:35:39  <rpk> your app server authentication.  say you switch from web sso to ldap to native tokens
2011-06-20T19:35:44  <dhackner> memcache is sandboxed as well
2011-06-20T19:35:49  <rpk> or some global switch, its the same problem
2011-06-20T19:36:32  <dhackner> not sure I follow you, but there is no scenario where two tests running against QAserver1 should have two seperate environments
2011-06-20T19:36:46  <rpk> why not?
2011-06-20T19:36:49  <dhackner> when the server updates it's code, tests are queued
2011-06-20T19:36:59  <dhackner> the env. should be identical
2011-06-20T19:37:01  <rpk> yes, so you distribute the tests in parallel
2011-06-20T19:37:09  <dhackner> we're testing against a specific revision of our product
2011-06-20T19:37:15  <dhackner> right
2011-06-20T19:37:20  <rpk> and they require different settings on or off in order to execute individual test cases
2011-06-20T19:37:35  <dhackner> yea but those aren't global
2011-06-20T19:37:45  <dhackner> a server has to handle multiple unrelated requests right?
2011-06-20T19:37:56  <dhackner> otherwise it would break whenever there are multiple users
2011-06-20T19:37:57  <rpk> but because test case a is running concurrently with test case b, and test case a is meant to exercise changing global config option b
2011-06-20T19:38:06  <rpk> then test case b can crash and burn
2011-06-20T19:38:14  <dhackner> the only thing they depend on
2011-06-20T19:38:17  <dhackner> is data in the DB
2011-06-20T19:38:28  <dhackner> and each test case gets sandboxed to its own DB/memcache instance
2011-06-20T19:38:41  <rpk> so how do you deploy new schemas?
2011-06-20T19:38:43  <dhackner> there are no global settings that are getting manipulated by 1 selenium test
2011-06-20T19:38:52  <dhackner> we run
2011-06-20T19:38:58  <dhackner> an upgrade script with our revisions
2011-06-20T19:39:06  <dhackner> so it is transactional
2011-06-20T19:39:22  <dhackner> thus any test can pinpoint which revision/schema it ran against
2011-06-20T19:39:44  <rpk> so whats running the deployment and upgrade scripts on the workers?  jenkins plugin?
2011-06-20T19:40:13  <dhackner> an upstream jenkins job
2011-06-20T19:40:15  <dhackner> 2 jobs
2011-06-20T19:40:26  <dhackner> 1 builds/upgrades based on SVN tracking of our product
2011-06-20T19:40:32  <dhackner> then kicks off a downstream test job
2011-06-20T19:40:44  <dhackner> which will email out if the upgrade broke the build
2011-06-20T19:41:02  <dhackner> the test job will also run by itself whenever you want or if u change the svn repo for test code
2011-06-20T19:41:13  <rpk> and then you manage tests through jenkins plugins?
2011-06-20T19:41:22  <dhackner> by manage, do you mean report?
2011-06-20T19:41:28  <rpk> sure
2011-06-20T19:41:37  <dhackner> yes, results are interpreted by jenkins
2011-06-20T19:41:41  <dhackner> and then emailed on failures
2011-06-20T19:41:48  <dhackner> what we do NOT have
2011-06-20T19:41:57  <dhackner> because we don't currently have the necessary scale
2011-06-20T19:42:03  <dhackner> is logic for determining which tests to run
2011-06-20T19:42:08  <dhackner> we currently just run everything
2011-06-20T19:42:13  <dhackner> because there just arent that many
2011-06-20T19:42:24  <rpk> oh
2011-06-20T19:42:40  <rpk> what plugin do you use for manageing tests?
2011-06-20T19:42:51  <rpk> like how do you link tests to results to requirements
2011-06-20T19:43:00  <dhackner> i run a testng framework
2011-06-20T19:43:07  <dhackner> there is a plugin to interpret the results
2011-06-20T19:43:11  <dhackner> it isn't great
2011-06-20T19:43:19  <dhackner> but the devs who work on it are pretty responsive
2011-06-20T19:43:28  <dhackner> testng is just very loosely defined in some ways
2011-06-20T19:43:36  <dhackner> but junit is jenkins lingua franca
2011-06-20T19:43:45  <dhackner> so it knows how to do that out of the box
2011-06-20T19:44:19  <dhackner> hey, Ive gotta run. Happy to continue this conversation later. I'll PM you my personal email.
2011-06-20T19:44:28  <rpk> sure

I am new to web testing in general and selenium in particular. I am migrating certain scripts from selenium 1.0 to 2.0 which were not written by me. Any pointers will be helpful.

2011-06-20T23:11:14  <hiredgun79> been pulling my hair out :)
2011-06-20T23:13:24  <hiredgun79> I've been scouring the internet looking for documentation - and I have the hub running in one window, the rc running in another, xvfb running in another, then finally the test running...
2011-06-20T23:13:58  <hiredgun79> firefox starts up, I can capture a screenshot, but it's just sitting there - selenium's not spitting out any error messages… can't really figure out what's going on
