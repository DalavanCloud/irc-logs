2011-09-26T04:57:27  <Zeu5> in a page where i have 2 different submit input elements

2011-09-26T04:58:23  <Zeu5> is this correct? $this->clickAndWait('css=input[type="submit" value="Update Product"]');

2011-09-26T05:23:52  <RossPatterson> Zeu5: Yes, that looks correct.  But you could probably omit the 'type="submit"', as you probably only have one element on the page with a VALUE attribute of "Update Product".

2011-09-26T05:30:14  <Zeu5> what if i ned to check for this exact element? <div id="flashMessage" class="flash_success">The Product has been saved</div>
2011-09-26T05:31:08  *** andreashaas has joined #selenium
2011-09-26T05:31:35  <RossPatterson> You can't do that with a CSS locator, because CSS doesn't have a way to match strings in element content (I assume you could have other messages in that DIV, like "Product didn't get saved :-(").
2011-09-26T05:31:42  <RossPatterson> But XPath can do it.
2011-09-26T05:31:57  <Zeu5> I am not familiar with XPath.. how do i do it in XPath?

2011-09-26T05:33:44  *** dawagner has joined #selenium
2011-09-26T05:33:47  <RossPatterson> Zeu5: There's lots to learn about XPath, and it's worth your time to do so.  But for this specific case, try "xpath=div[@id='flashMessage' and contains(text(), ''The Product has been saved)]".
2011-09-26T05:34:39  <RossPatterson> Oops ... I meant "... has been saved')]" (left out the closing single-quote).
2011-09-26T05:35:23  <RossPatterson> Rats.  Let's try that again: "xpath=div[@id='flashMessage' and contains(text(), 'The Product has been saved')]"  Yeah, that's it.
2011-09-26T05:35:58  <RossPatterson> Zeu5: If you're using Firefox, you might want to download an extension called "XPather".
2011-09-26T05:39:06  <Zeu5> thank you Ross
2011-09-26T05:39:07  <Zeu5> xpath=//div[@id="flashMessage"][@class="flash_success"][contains(text(), "The Product has been saved")]
2011-09-26T05:39:13  <Zeu5> was the correct answer :)
2011-09-26T05:40:12  <RossPatterson> Well, that's A correct answer.  I'll bet you could omit the @class=, since ID attributes are supposed to be unique.  And you can combine adjacent predicates (the "[...]" things) with "
2011-09-26T05:40:27  <RossPatterson> ... with "and", since that's what having them adjacent means.
2011-09-26T05:40:37  <RossPatterson> Glad it worked, though.

2011-09-26T08:00:49  <jimevans> nirvdrum: top of my head, no, but i could look into it.
2011-09-26T08:03:30  <nirvdrum> If you have some time, I'd appreciate it.  But don't sink any significant effort into it.
2011-09-26T08:03:38  <nirvdrum> I was trying to track it down last night and couldn't.
2011-09-26T08:04:15  <nirvdrum> IE 9 actually supports the CSS opacity property.  So just relying on filter processing won't cut it, unfortuantely.
2011-09-26T08:04:36  <nirvdrum> That interface seems to be the way to grab the opacity value, as IHTMLCurrentStyle6 isn't a public interface.
2011-09-26T08:06:12  <jimevans> can you get the opacity property via javascript? if so, how?

2011-09-26T08:19:15  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: LOLz. no, it's perfectly mainstream, and completely safe for work.
2011-09-26T08:21:06  <jimevans> nirvdrum: i *think* at its heart, the get_style() method just returns an object that may or may not implement IHTMLCSSStyleDeclaration.
2011-09-26T08:21:34  <jimevans> i find it instructive to try the operation in javascript first, and then try QI for the appropriate interface if that works.
2011-09-26T08:21:37  <nirvdrum> jimevans: Makes sense.  I've always assumed it just handled one of the IHTMLCurrentStyle variants.
2011-09-26T08:21:43  <dawagner> krosenvold: +1
2011-09-26T08:22:03  <nirvdrum> Yeah, the JS approach is wonky because the style & currentStyle objects follow weird fallback rules.
2011-09-26T08:22:16  <jimevans> nirvdrum: the object passed back probably implements all of the style interface, but I could be wrong.
2011-09-26T08:22:33  <nirvdrum> I'll try it out and see.

2011-09-26T08:24:43  <cgoldberg> dawagner, hey.  i have an issue with file uploads.  as far as I can tell, it looks like this:  http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=93909
2011-09-26T08:25:40  <nirvdrum> jimevans: Yeah.  The SnapsIE code as an automation DLL registers itself as part of the build process.
2011-09-26T08:25:43  <dawagner> I see - well, you can always build from source if it's really important.  I have a significant update which I'm still polishing, which will definitely cause a release, but I'm not sure when yet

2011-09-26T11:19:10  <jarib> checking what the browser is up to at that point may be a good idea

2011-09-26T15:23:28  <jarib> Renacor: yes, we launch firefox twice - first to "clean" the profile, second to actually run firefox
2011-09-26T15:23:46  <jarib> if you send something that's not a valid zip file, i'd expect errors though
2011-09-26T15:24:01  <jarib> since then the server can't unpack it
2011-09-26T15:24:32  <Renacor> jarib: I send base64_encoded nonsense and it still loads firefox
2011-09-26T15:24:42  <Renacor> firefox_profile is the varname right?
2011-09-26T15:25:44  <Renacor> ugh even non base64_encoded text works
2011-09-26T15:28:59  <jarib> from reading FirefoxDriver.java, it should throw you're not sending valid zip data
2011-09-26T15:29:09  <jarib> and yes, firefox_profile is the right capability name

2011-09-26T15:37:33  <jarib> indeed, seems like it's ignored
2011-09-26T15:37:36  <jarib> for some reason
2011-09-26T15:37:58  <Renacor> the ruby lib uses jsonwire as well?
2011-09-26T15:38:13  <jarib> let me verify that passing the profile actually works..
2011-09-26T15:38:14  *** cgoldberg has quit IRC
2011-09-26T15:38:16  <jarib> yes.
2011-09-26T15:38:29  <Renacor> k yeah I hope you can include a profile with jsonwire =P
2011-09-26T15:39:53  <jarib> yeah, it works
2011-09-26T15:40:14  <Renacor> hmm
2011-09-26T15:40:25  <Renacor> you zip up somerandomtext.profilename
2011-09-26T15:40:41  <Renacor> then base64_encode it  and send it
2011-09-26T15:40:52  <Renacor> hmmm maybe the way I zip it up is b0rked
2011-09-26T15:42:15  <jarib> i think you zip up the *contents* of the profile dir
2011-09-26T15:42:31  <Renacor> not the actual dir?
2011-09-26T15:42:34  <jarib> right.
2011-09-26T15:42:40  <Renacor> ohh
2011-09-26T15:42:57  <Renacor> big difference
2011-09-26T15:43:02  <Renacor> lemme try that
2011-09-26T15:44:08  <jarib> adamgoucher: so looks like it's a real RAM problem
2011-09-26T15:44:27  <adamgoucher> ya. saw your email. i wouldnt even know where to begin to debug that :)
2011-09-26T15:45:39  <jarib> guess we'll see what patrick says
2011-09-26T15:46:46  <Renacor> jarib: that did the trick
2011-09-26T15:47:00  <Renacor> jarib: loads my profile now but firefox can't seem to connec to the inter tubes =P
2011-09-26T15:47:25  <Renacor> prolly something with my profile
2011-09-26T15:49:15  *** cgp_ has joined #selenium
2011-09-26T15:50:14  <jarib> Renacor: the profile needs to have the webdriver extension in it, you can just zip up a random profile
2011-09-26T15:50:33  <jarib> Renacor: again, you really should read the code of the official bindings to see how things work
2011-09-26T15:50:48  <jarib> it's not super simple :P

2011-09-26T15:53:39  *** cgp_ has quit IRC
2011-09-26T15:54:34  <jarib> that sounds like the extension is there
2011-09-26T15:54:47  <Renacor> should it be in the prefs.js ?

2011-09-26T15:56:29  <jarib> at least after launch
2011-09-26T15:56:30  <Renacor> jarib: could you point me to the site that explains how to use custom profiles?
2011-09-26T15:56:47  <jarib> AFAIK prefs.js is created from user.js when firefox is launched the first time
