2011-03-19T13:26:12  <ken_wienecke> Is there anybody out there who can answer a Selenium newbie question about locators?
2011-03-19T13:26:39  <ato> Better to just ask your question, I think.
2011-03-19T13:26:46  <ken_wienecke> OK.
2011-03-19T13:26:58  <ken_wienecke> Here is the template-resident HTML I'm trying to reference:
2011-03-19T13:26:58  <ken_wienecke> <div class="bd" id="topic_container">
2011-03-19T13:26:59  <ken_wienecke>          <ul id="topic_list">
2011-03-19T13:26:59  <ken_wienecke>          <li id="topic_selected"><a href="page.php?item_id=script_detail&uid=%%var___uid%%">General Overview</a></li>
2011-03-19T13:27:00  <ken_wienecke>          <li><a href="page.php?item_id=script_detail_sym&uid=%%var___uid%%">Symbols & Characters</a></li>
2011-03-19T13:27:00  <ken_wienecke>          <li><a href="page.php?item_id=script_detail_use&uid=%%var___uid%%">Use & History</a></li>
2011-03-19T13:27:00  <ken_wienecke>          <li><a href="page.php?item_id=script_detail_des&uid=%%var___uid%%">Design & Typography</a></li>

2011-03-19T13:27:01  <ken_wienecke>          <li><a href="page.php?item_id=script_detail_font&uid=%%var___uid%%">Fonts & Keyboards</a></li>
2011-03-19T13:27:01  <ken_wienecke>          <li><a href="page.php?item_id=script_detail_need&uid=%%var___uid%%">Needs</a></li>
2011-03-19T13:27:02  <ken_wienecke>          <li><a href="page.php?item_id=script_detail_ref&uid=%%var___uid%%">Sources & References</a></li>
2011-03-19T13:27:02  <ken_wienecke>          </ul>
2011-03-19T13:27:02  <ken_wienecke>  </div>
2011-03-19T13:27:09  <ken_wienecke> The "%%var____uid%%" strings are markers that are replaced with string values, so don't let that distract you. I am trying to get the Selenium IDE to click the "Symbols & Characters" link. You'd think that would be easy: "clickAndWait link=Symbols & Characters".
2011-03-19T13:27:23  <ken_wienecke> But when control gets to that instruction, Selenium stops with "[error] Element link=Symbols & Characters not found".
2011-03-19T13:27:25  *** brettporter has joined #selenium
2011-03-19T13:27:31  <ken_wienecke> How do I make a locator that will make the Selenium IDE click that link?
2011-03-19T13:29:22  <ken_wienecke> I don't have control over the styling of class "bd", and it makes a link with a funky highlighted arrow. Could the CSS attributes be interfering with Selenium's ability to recognize the link?

2011-03-19T13:33:07  <ken_wienecke> Would putting a unique id in each link (like <a -url- id=sym_char>Symbols & Characters</a>) and then using clickAndWait id=sym_char do the trick?
2011-03-19T13:49:32  <ken_wienecke> I just tested my last idea. Selenium can't find the element in the page with that id. I know it's there, though, because Firebug can find it.
2011-03-19T13:56:28  *** brettporter has joined #selenium
2011-03-19T13:58:52  <ken_wienecke> Oh, duh. This is not a Selenium problem, it's a programmer problem. I first need to go from the current page (which doesn't have these links) to the page which does.
