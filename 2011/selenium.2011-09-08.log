2011-09-08T03:57:30  <davehunt_> nirvdrum: I'm interested too.. any idea when it'll be released? ;)
2011-09-08T03:57:50  <nirvdrum> Not sure.  We've been on a pretty regular schedule though.

2011-09-08T03:58:12  <davehunt_> yeah, although I think it was intended for release last week
2011-09-08T03:58:22  <nirvdrum> Probably because those Mozilla wankers keep messing with us.
2011-09-08T03:58:34  <davehunt_> :)
2011-09-08T04:02:14  <nirvdrum> There's one more grid change I want to try to slip in.  I have a rough idea of how I want to do it, but it wasn't as clear as I was hoping.
2011-09-08T04:02:36  <nirvdrum> Basically it'd be nice to configure the RemoteProxy implementation on the hub side, rather than the client side, if using grid 1 launchers.
2011-09-08T04:02:58  <nirvdrum> Alternatively, I could push out one final grid 1 release.  But if I do that, I'd rather not change the config options.

2011-09-08T04:14:47  <freynaud> nirvdrum, I remember writing the code for your default RC proxy, but I can't find it anymore ..
2011-09-08T04:15:41  <nirvdrum> freynaud: Ahh.  I was thinking I would just make it a configuration item in the grid1 config file, so it'd only be set for Selenium 1 requests.  Alas, only the JSON config is passed, not the registry config.
2011-09-08T04:16:50  <freynaud> nirvdrum, the code I wrote was in RegistrationServlet, after line 71
2011-09-08T04:17:41  <freynaud> nirvdrum, if the server object has proxy = default one, but Registry has a proxy specified, use the registry one instead
2011-09-08T04:18:05  <freynaud> proxy = default one and it's RC, not if it's wd
2011-09-08T04:23:21  <nirvdrum> I was going to do it RegistrationRequest.  So you could still use the WD default proxy for everything and then a separate RC proxy default.

2011-09-08T07:12:15  <lord1234> have you downloaded the trunk?
2011-09-08T07:12:22  <Parabola> lol no
2011-09-08T07:12:37  <lord1234> imho the best way would be to dl the trunk, overwrite the RCLauncher.java iwth my version, make your changes, then perform an  svn diff on that and make a NEW patch.txt

2011-09-08T07:30:05  <Parabola> why are they still writing that browser?
2011-09-08T07:30:08  <Parabola> thats the question right?
2011-09-08T07:30:27  <lord1234> it still has the dominant market share
2011-09-08T07:30:27  <lord1234> thats why
2011-09-08T07:33:53  <XRayCulver> jimevans: are you still thinking of moving the ie driver to a seperate exe similar to the chrome driver?
2011-09-08T07:35:24  <jimevans_> Yes, eventually. Now that people have got used to needing ChromeDriver.exe, it's an easier sell.

2011-09-08T08:55:47  <ideaz> hey guys, could be a question for naives but as selenium site mentions this, why isnt selenium good for load testing?
2011-09-08T08:56:03  <selbot2_> andreastt@opera.com less than 10 seconds ago - AndreasTolfTolfsen: Enabling logging from driver if :logging_level is (explicitly) set to any value; also forwarding profile regardless whether it's sent due to OperaDriver respecting the value null - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=13786
2011-09-08T08:56:32  <arnlaugsson_> ideaz: I am interested in that question/answer as well.
2011-09-08T08:56:33  <freynaud> ideaz: because of the overhead of the browser. Generating load would mean starting 200 firefox for instance. That will be tricky
2011-09-08T08:56:50  <andreastt> simonstewart: Did you commit that code for opera-emulation-tests?
2011-09-08T08:56:59  <lukeis> you could do it with HtmlUnitDriver... but there are better tools to do load
2011-09-08T08:57:01  <freynaud> and a huge waste of resource compared to specialized tools
2011-09-08T08:57:19  <ideaz> so what is selenium grid solving here?
2011-09-08T08:57:39  <RossPatterson> ideaz: Of course, that's pretty much the whole idea behind BrowserMob.com.  And it uses Selenium to do it.
2011-09-08T08:57:56  <ideaz> the overhead of the browser is at the client, but it doesnt affect/impact the host's load does it?
2011-09-08T08:58:35  <lukeis> ideaz: it's just a resource constraint... if you have 100 boxes that you can remote to... then you can do it ;)
2011-09-08T08:58:45  <ideaz> I mean isnt the host/server hammered with all those simulateneous requests?
2011-09-08T08:59:25  <ideaz> lukeis, freynaud i'm trying to load test the server in this case, I don't see why selenium is not a choice
2011-09-08T08:59:57  <lukeis> it's not not a choice... just not the 'best' choice
2011-09-08T09:00:13  <lukeis> unless you do like RossPatterson said an use browsermob or gomez ;)
2011-09-08T09:00:32  <freynaud> ideaz: you can also invite 200 friends in a big room, and ask them to bring their computers and click when you shout. That wroks, but it's not exactly scalable
2011-09-08T09:00:34  <selbot> New news from builds: S2RB-WDUNIT-127 was SUCCESSFUL (with 88 tests) : Updated by andreastt@opera.com <http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/S2RB-WDUNIT-127>
2011-09-08T09:00:37  <ideaz> please excuse my ignorance here but how is browser overhead involved ?
2011-09-08T09:01:13  <lukeis> selenium has to start up a browser... if you want to do load then you need to start up a couple hundred of them... ever try to do that? :)
2011-09-08T09:01:20  <ideaz> exactly freynaud, isnt selenium grid solving it? and the my hosting server, it does makes no difference whether I invite actual users or use selenium grid
2011-09-08T09:01:56  <ideaz> lukeis, i could run it over multiple VMs
2011-09-08T09:02:21  <freynaud> ideaz: grid allows you to launch selenium on multiple computers. You still have to buy those computers ( easy part ) , then syncronize all the browsers. ( hard )
2011-09-08T09:02:21  <lukeis> hopefully on multiple physical devices too
2011-09-08T09:02:39  <freynaud> ideaz: you have some tools better suited for that, using less resources and doing the sync
2011-09-08T09:03:09  <ideaz> freynaud, HtmlUnitDriver?
2011-09-08T09:03:36  <ideaz> what is one good enough reason not to use selenium to simulate real-world load scenario
2011-09-08T09:04:20  <lukeis> imo it's hard to really simulate the real world... but we all try ;)
2011-09-08T09:04:24  <RossPatterson> ideaz: Sounds like you're not convinced.  Give it a try, tell us how it turns out.
2011-09-08T09:04:29  <freynaud> ideaz: try it yourself I would say. Try to launch 50 firefoxs, and use jmeter to send 50 requests
2011-09-08T09:04:34  <eghm> ideaz: as far as load, you would need a lot of instances
2011-09-08T09:04:42  <RossPatterson> BrowserMob's experience suggests it can be done, if you're willing to work hard at it.
2011-09-08T09:05:08  <ideaz> i agree i'd need lot of instances but my test doesn't need 100+ clients/browsers.. 50? yes
2011-09-08T09:05:17  <jarib> andreastt: hmm, it should just be the server output. i'll check it out
2011-09-08T09:05:56  *** stackedsax has quit IRC
2011-09-08T09:06:21  <freynaud> ideaz: start selenium, open firefox in a loop 50 :)
2011-09-08T09:06:26  <ideaz> RossPatterson, I'm fairly new to it, I'm not challenging anyone here :) just trying to increase my knowledge. But you're right, am not very convinced yet
2011-09-08T09:07:10  <freynaud> ideaz: you'll always have people who will try to use selenium to do load test, because that will allow them to reuse the selenium test cases
2011-09-08T09:07:29  *** soc42 has quit IRC
2011-09-08T09:07:41  <ideaz> i still can't see how the server hosting the pages would know the difference of a 50 selenium 'bots' accessing them, or 50 actual users
2011-09-08T09:07:57  <RossPatterson> It wouldn't.  Nobody's suggesting it would.
2011-09-08T09:07:59  <freynaud> ideaz: selenium is done to do page validation the way a human would do it. It's not design for load testing. You can always bend the tool to do it, it's just not the easiest way
2011-09-08T09:08:29  <ideaz> hmm
2011-09-08T09:08:51  <jarib> andreastt: WFM https://gist.github.com/1203805
2011-09-08T09:09:26  <freynaud> ideaz: for instance if you use jmeter, and want to move from 50 to 10 request, it's 1 param. To move from a 50 browsers to 100 browser grid, it means new hardware, neww setup etc.
2011-09-08T09:10:28  <ideaz> hmmm, but considering for a sec those parameters are consistent and known before hand, selenium can be used
2011-09-08T09:10:58  <ideaz> and also the guy has made quite enough progress into researching and implementing
2011-09-08T09:10:59  <ideaz> :)
2011-09-08T09:11:05  <freynaud> ideaz: if you're happy dealing with the brwoser syncronization, sure
2011-09-08T09:11:44  <ideaz> got it
2011-09-08T09:12:12  <freynaud> ideaz: if you want to check what happens when 50 users click on your home page, you need to make sure that there is not 10 firefox lagging being because the started on a slower PC, so you need to wait for those.
2011-09-08T09:12:28  <freynaud> ideaz: while you wait, the fastest one may time out
2011-09-08T09:12:40  <ideaz> true
2011-09-08T09:13:06  *** stackedsax has joined #selenium
2011-09-08T09:13:08  <freynaud> ideaz: you can control all that, so you'll have it working in the end, it's just not done with those problems in mind, so you'll need to create your own framework around it
2011-09-08T09:13:12  <ideaz> but, say if i had 25VMs with 2 browser windows
2011-09-08T09:13:28  <ideaz> well I get the sense of what you mean though
2011-09-08T09:13:40  <freynaud> ideaz: in a works where VM never crash, network is always up etc, it always works :p
2011-09-08T09:13:56  <ideaz> :)
2011-09-08T09:14:25  <freynaud> ideaz: grid is done more around the concept : run the tests at some point, and recover when it crashes
2011-09-08T09:14:40  <ideaz> ya
2011-09-08T09:14:46  <ideaz> now its making sense
2011-09-08T09:14:47  <freynaud> ideaz: the "at some point" assumption is what will make your idea hard to realize
2011-09-08T09:15:28  <ideaz> so what are those other tools again, BrowserMob, and ?

2011-09-08T11:48:12  <Binken_> Normal, we only the value we selected. But in my case we could see all the option. But it's not mutiple

2011-09-08T11:52:23  <selbot> New news from builds: S2JS-TESTS-48 was SUCCESSFUL (with 43 tests) : Updated by Daniel Wagner-Hall <http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/S2JS-TESTS-48>
2011-09-08T11:53:27  <Binken_> Yeah. I have a glance at the atoms for the click action for option.
2011-09-08T11:53:44  <Binken_> it seems only fire the click event for specic situation

2011-09-08T12:00:21  <jimevans> Binken_: it looks like the click event should be getting fired ($/javascript/atoms/mouse.js, line 300), but i find it really hard to follow the execution of the atoms code.

2011-09-08T12:04:08  <Binken_> If it's not a mutiple, it should fire the click event
2011-09-08T12:04:43  <jimevans> even if it is, it should fire it, if i'm reading the code right.
2011-09-08T12:06:32  <Binken_> so it's a little strange it do not fire the click event.
2011-09-08T12:06:49  *** freynaud_ has joined #selenium

2011-09-08T12:10:18  <Binken_> By the way, jim
2011-09-08T12:10:23  <stackedsax> thanks for the info
2011-09-08T12:10:28  <jimevans> yes?

2011-09-08T12:10:48  <simonstewart> Problems?
2011-09-08T12:10:53  <Binken_> If you using the zoom tool in IE9, you'll fails the tests
2011-09-08T12:11:03  <stackedsax> I was hoping to test the fixes for #2398

2011-09-08T12:11:17  <simonstewart> I think that the problem with firefox is that the accessibility apis are returning incorrect values (on Windows only)
2011-09-08T12:11:21  <jimevans> Binken_: known issue. wiki page even says you have to configure zoom to 100%
2011-09-08T12:11:57  <nirvdrum> krosenvold_: What's up?
2011-09-08T12:12:03  <Binken_> aha, that issue blocks my colleague one day...finally I fixed it

2011-09-08T12:17:08  <nirvdrum> The issue tracker is a zoo at times.
2011-09-08T12:17:21  <RossPatterson> Maybe we need to turn off comments on issues :-)
2011-09-08T12:17:23  <nirvdrum> I don't like having to come down on people.  But some of the grid issues have gotten grossly out of hand.
2011-09-08T12:17:30  <RossPatterson> (hee hee)
2011-09-08T12:17:56  <simonstewart> which ones?
2011-09-08T12:18:38  <simonstewart> I get a lot of people telling me that things are CRITICAL

2011-09-08T12:24:25  <krosenvold_> nirvdrum: You see, I did an experimental refactoring where I broke the Registry into smaller pieces with well defined architectural roles. The ProxySet was the only thing I was totally happy with in that first round
2011-09-08T12:24:32  <stackedsax> it has since been fixed
2011-09-08T12:24:43  <nirvdrum> Now my reply to the original issue is lost in the shuffle.
2011-09-08T12:24:44  * krosenvold_ is looking at newSessionRequests
2011-09-08T12:24:56  <stackedsax> except that I have been seeing some of the same behaivior now in sel2
2011-09-08T12:24:57  <nirvdrum> I guess I could just svn annotate.
2011-09-08T12:25:07  <nirvdrum> But dawagner did a number on that one :-P

2011-09-08T12:25:49  <krosenvold_> nirvdrum: I added some locks, yes
2011-09-08T12:25:58  <stackedsax> I realized later that #544 was probably an old issue, and so I opened #2398 — I should have gone back to #544 and made a note

2011-09-08T12:26:02  <krosenvold_> It was being access partially locked and partially unlocked
2011-09-08T12:26:29  <nirvdrum> krosenvold_: Okay. I added a remove method with locks around it.  And found a place that was modifying the queue without locks.
2011-09-08T12:26:58  <krosenvold_> Yup. What I want to do with the registry is to make all the queues into self-contained entitites
2011-09-08T12:27:19  <krosenvold_> And you basically have threads/workers moving stuff between the queues. Kind of like jms without jms
2011-09-08T12:27:39  <krosenvold_> I promised freynaud I'd still keep the "Registry" class for compatibility
2011-09-08T12:27:42  <krosenvold_> As a facade
2011-09-08T12:28:18  <krosenvold_> It's bascially what it /does/ today, but it's not too visible in the code
2011-09-08T12:28:50  <krosenvold_> And it makes for a helluva lot easier synchronization models
2011-09-08T12:28:58  <krosenvold_> (More efficient too)
2011-09-08T12:30:07  <krosenvold_> And the proxyset was the first step in that direction

2011-09-08T12:34:30  <nirvdrum> krosenvold_: I don't like that Registry leaks those collections.  I'd rather it operate as a manager of sorts.  But I'm happy to see what you have instead.
2011-09-08T12:35:10  <nirvdrum> stackedsax: No worries.  Like I said, you're right to be frustrated.  It just makes it hard to actually address issues.
2011-09-08T12:35:18  <jimevans> i'm re-testing IE, as i had to make a last-minute change, but i'm ready to sign off once those are done.
2011-09-08T12:35:58  <simonstewart> (offer him a hug! Everyone loves them)
2011-09-08T12:36:15  <nirvdrum> krosenvold_: I had one other change I wanted to get into grid, but if it slips to 2.7.0, it's not catastrophic.

2011-09-08T12:36:24  <Dude-X> just because he works with ie
2011-09-08T12:36:44  <nirvdrum> I guess I'm odd because I don't hate IE.
2011-09-08T12:36:52  <nirvdrum> I hate whiny web developers.
2011-09-08T12:37:01  <jimevans> i used to not hate ie. :)
2011-09-08T12:37:33  <nirvdrum> I can't imagine any other job where it would be tolerated to work outside of your customer's environment and then bitch about your customer not using your environment.
2011-09-08T12:37:36  <nirvdrum> It's insane.
2011-09-08T12:37:49  <jimevans> then i started working on the IE driver.
2011-09-08T12:38:06  <nirvdrum> jimevans: Having worked with bothe MSHTML and NPAPI a lot, you don't really know how good you have it.
2011-09-08T12:38:30  <simonstewart> I'm pretty sure he does
2011-09-08T12:38:49  <nirvdrum> NPAPI is about as obtuse as it gets.
2011-09-08T12:39:05  <nirvdrum> That's why I love Firebreath.

2011-09-08T12:41:17  <nirvdrum> jimevans: Believe it or not, it's also much harder in C#.  I inherited a BHO written in C# that used COM interop.  That hurts.  A lot.
2011-09-08T12:41:36  <jimevans> oh, i've done it in C#. major PITA.
2011-09-08T12:41:41  <simonstewart> COM Interop got better in .Net 4, though
2011-09-08T12:41:43  <simonstewart> I think
2011-09-08T12:41:49  <jimevans> aye, it did.
2011-09-08T12:41:53  <simonstewart> The main problem that I used to face were the PIA
2011-09-08T12:41:53  <XRayCulver> are cssSelectors rooted? ex: Driver.FindElement(By.Id("idhere")).FindElements(By.Css("a")); ?
2011-09-08T12:42:05  <nirvdrum> Ahh.  I did this back in 2005 - 2006 for my thesis project.
2011-09-08T12:42:12  <nirvdrum> So, it's been a while.
2011-09-08T12:42:18  <jimevans> XRayCulver: should be.
2011-09-08T12:42:27  <simonstewart> The second IE driver was written in C# and used COM Interop
2011-09-08T12:42:57  <jimevans> simonstewart: yikes! impose the .net framework on everyone using the project?!?
2011-09-08T12:43:18  <simonstewart> The .Net runtime is on all Windows machines these days
2011-09-08T12:43:28  <simonstewart> Seemed like the easiest way to get things done at the time
2011-09-08T12:43:32  <jimevans> (says jimevans, who really likes the .NET framework)
2011-09-08T12:43:41  <simonstewart> :)
2011-09-08T12:44:01  <jimevans> well, it's easier than writing C++ code. less prone to hard crashes.
2011-09-08T12:44:11  <XRayCulver> jimevans: tahnks

2011-09-08T12:44:29  <simonstewart> I reckon you could still nuke things using interop
2011-09-08T12:44:53  <krosenvold_> nirvdrum: I think the registry is leaking far too muhc collections already, so it won't ;)
2011-09-08T12:45:19  <jimevans> depends on the pia you use (whether generated internally using 'dynamic' or explicitly)
2011-09-08T12:45:22  <krosenvold_> Uh;oh alerts test doesnt work on ff3 here
2011-09-08T12:45:30  <simonstewart> It was a lot faster just to mark all issues as "read"
