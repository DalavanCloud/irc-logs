2011-04-03T10:17:24  <santiycr> yup
2011-04-03T10:17:26  <santiycr> you around?
2011-04-03T10:17:53  <AutomatedTester> i was thinking of heading over there in a bit
2011-04-03T10:17:59  <AutomatedTester> do a bit of hacking there
2011-04-03T10:18:07  <santiycr> pretty good crowd here
2011-04-03T10:18:16  <santiycr> the first talk went super long
2011-04-03T10:18:33  <santiycr> I'm guessing next one will start in like 10/15 min
2011-04-03T10:18:57  <AutomatedTester> i dont have a ticket, was going to hang around outside the room if there is a space
2011-04-03T10:19:13  <santiycr> come, you're VIP ;)
2011-04-03T10:19:19  <plightbo> oh yeah, WatirDay is today!
2011-04-03T10:19:27  <plightbo> damn, i really should have booked my flight earlier
2011-04-03T10:19:35  <santiycr> I'm sure no one will have any problems with you walking by
2011-04-03T10:19:58  <santiycr> @plightbo: yeah, this ended up being a full week event
2011-04-03T10:20:07  <santiycr> considering hackaton on thu too
2011-04-03T10:20:37  * santiycr can't believe is going to be waking up at 7 each day for the next 5 days :S
2011-04-03T10:21:04  <AutomatedTester> thanks to Jetlag, 7am wont be a problem
2011-04-03T10:21:13  <santiycr> :)
2011-04-03T10:21:59  <plightbo> santiycr: Five Hour Energy
2011-04-03T10:22:44  <santiycr> @plightbo: tried in the past, but my stomach doesn't like that thing first time in the morning
2011-04-03T10:22:57  <plightbo> yeah, gotta eat first
2011-04-03T10:23:16  <santiycr> will keep it in mind
2011-04-03T10:23:34  <plightbo> AutomatedTester: browsermob-proxy is starting to look pretty nice
2011-04-03T10:23:35  <santiycr> @AutomatedTester: will mention you to the guy in the door
2011-04-03T10:23:47  <plightbo> so it boots up on port 8080 (or whatever port you want)
2011-04-03T10:23:48  <santiycr> pretty sure they won't have any problem
2011-04-03T10:23:56  <plightbo> then you need to POST to /proxy and it'll spit back at you:
2011-04-03T10:23:57  <AutomatedTester> cool plightbo
2011-04-03T10:24:03  <plightbo> {"port":"9091"}
2011-04-03T10:24:19  <plightbo> then launch your Selenium with the browser configured to use that proxy port
2011-04-03T10:24:20  <AutomatedTester> thanks santiycr
2011-04-03T10:24:29  <plightbo> and the you can do this any time
2011-04-03T10:24:36  <plightbo> curl http://localhost:8080/proxy/90901/har
2011-04-03T10:24:40  <plightbo> and get back a HAR file
2011-04-03T10:24:48  <santiycr> @plightbo: something a sauce user reported about selenium's embedded proxy is that it doesn't support webdav
2011-04-03T10:25:01  <santiycr> you may want to check that out
2011-04-03T10:25:13  <santiycr> even though I'm not a big fan of non standard HTTP requests
2011-04-03T10:25:25  <plightbo> santiycr: ok, i will... the browsermob proxy is a pretty big fork of the Se proxy, so we may have already fixed it
2011-04-03T10:26:04  <plightbo> still hoping to get Sauce/Eric to focus efforts on that instead of the Se proxy. Simon and I would like for nothing more than to kill the internal proxy :)

2011-04-03T11:28:15  <simonstewart> Talking about nesting components
2011-04-03T11:28:22  <simonstewart> Very similar to the conversation jarib and I had last night
2011-04-03T11:29:15  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: we at Mozilla do a kinda nesting
2011-04-03T11:29:22  <AutomatedTester> in our POMs
2011-04-03T11:29:36  <simonstewart> It's something that I've written about on the mailing list
2011-04-03T11:29:46  <simonstewart> But there's a more sophisticated way of doing things
2011-04-03T11:29:58  <simonstewart> I really need to write some of this down

2011-04-03T11:31:21  <simonstewart> right
2011-04-03T11:31:37  <simonstewart> It's why LoadableComponent is called LoadableComponent and not Page
2011-04-03T11:31:51  <simonstewart> That, and everyone loves to have a root object called "page"
2011-04-03T11:32:45  <AutomatedTester> inherited from before I started
2011-04-03T11:35:16  <simonstewart> The idea is sound

2011-04-03T13:08:55  <AutomatedTester> and then IE and Chrome for the navigation spec
2011-04-03T13:09:09  <AutomatedTester> yea, been working with Honza on a few fixes
2011-04-03T13:09:39  <plightbo> latest NetExport is jacked as far as I can tell
2011-04-03T13:09:48  *** kylls1 has quit IRC
2011-04-03T13:10:01  <plightbo> what versions of Firebug, Selenium, Firefox, and NetExport are you using?
2011-04-03T13:10:07  <plightbo> using FireStarter also?
2011-04-03T13:10:24  <AutomatedTester> Selenium 2b3
2011-04-03T13:10:55  <plightbo> also, Java or some other language binding?
2011-04-03T13:11:22  <AutomatedTester> .net and python
2011-04-03T13:11:25  <AutomatedTester> I know those work
2011-04-03T13:11:50  <plightbo> so can you tell me more about your setup?
2011-04-03T13:11:51  <plightbo> versions?
2011-04-03T13:11:58  <plightbo> Firebug, Firefox, NetExport?
2011-04-03T13:12:02  <AutomatedTester> I am sorting that at the moment
2011-04-03T13:12:05  <plightbo> what fixes are you working with Honza on?
2011-04-03T13:12:06  <plightbo> hehe
2011-04-03T13:12:11  <plightbo> ok, well i am too (like literally right now)
2011-04-03T13:12:15  <plightbo> so maybe we can help each other
2011-04-03T13:12:25  <AutomatedTester> NetExport doesnt always follow the HAR spec
2011-04-03T13:12:45  *** simonstewart has joined #selenium
2011-04-03T13:12:48  <plightbo> as for browsermob-proxy, it's getting a LOT better starting today
2011-04-03T13:13:03  <simonstewart> arrived back here just in time. Yay!
2011-04-03T13:13:06  <plightbo> it now is API-controlled, can do multiple proxies for concurrent tests
2011-04-03T13:13:10  <plightbo> native HAR support, etc
2011-04-03T13:13:21  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: can you tell Alister the other sandwiches have arrived
2011-04-03T13:13:24  <plightbo> of course, still limited by the fact that it's a proxy, but pushes things about as far as it can go
2011-04-03T13:15:05  <AutomatedTester> plightbo: before Firefox 4 I had firebug-1.6.0.xpi, netExport-0.8b9.xpi
2011-04-03T13:15:27  <AutomatedTester> I am also going to show how we can use HAR to PageSpeed for a quick results
2011-04-03T13:16:00  <plightbo> cool
2011-04-03T13:16:32  <AutomatedTester> which is where I finding the issues with the HAR spec
2011-04-03T13:16:58  <plightbo> what kind of problems?
2011-04-03T13:17:12  <AutomatedTester> HAR spec and NetExport
2011-04-03T13:17:21  <plightbo> like what kind? :)
2011-04-03T13:17:30  <plightbo> the issue i'm seeing with the latest Firebug and NetExport is simpler than HAR compatibility
2011-04-03T13:17:31  <AutomatedTester> like if a download is aborted, what should the result be?
2011-04-03T13:17:41  <plightbo> the damn thing isn't spitting out the har files automatically
2011-04-03T13:17:41  <AutomatedTester> since the result is required by the Spec
2011-04-03T13:17:50  <plightbo> can you show me what profile settings you're using?
2011-04-03T13:17:52  *** santiycr has quit IRC
2011-04-03T13:17:57  <plightbo> Honza rejected a patch of mine a while back
2011-04-03T13:18:08  <plightbo> but I'm still sort of convinced that it was necessary :)
2011-04-03T13:19:26  *** dmachi1 has joined #selenium
2011-04-03T13:19:27  *** dmachi has quit IRC
2011-04-03T13:19:46  <AutomatedTester> https://github.com/AutomatedTester/AutomatedTester.PagePerf/blob/master/AutomatedTester.PagePerf/PagePerfFirefoxDriver.cs#L82
2011-04-03T13:20:09  <AutomatedTester> thats the code that I know is in use at my old company
2011-04-03T13:20:18  <AutomatedTester> but its Pre-FF4
2011-04-03T13:20:32  <plightbo> and the har files get dumped inside the profile dir?
2011-04-03T13:20:44  <AutomatedTester> yea
2011-04-03T13:20:53  <plightbo> one problem I have with the files getting dumped in the profile dir is that in Java you can't actually get a handle to the profile dir :)
2011-04-03T13:21:05  <plightbo> simonstewart or someone changed the way FirefoxProfile works
2011-04-03T13:21:17  <plightbo> and now none of the Java code keeps a handle to the profile dir that is easy to get
2011-04-03T13:21:21  <plightbo> so I gotta fix that up :)
2011-04-03T13:21:30  <simonstewart> I chancged the way that the profiles work
2011-04-03T13:21:30  <plightbo> ok, i'll try that stuff out in a bit
2011-04-03T13:21:35  <simonstewart> so that they can be reused.
2011-04-03T13:21:37  <plightbo> simonstewart: yeah, i kind of hate the change :)
2011-04-03T13:21:47  <simonstewart> Kind of can't be avoided
2011-04-03T13:21:48  <plightbo> i actually don't really mind it
2011-04-03T13:22:01  <plightbo> but need a way to ask the FirefoxBinary or FirefoxDriver for it's profile dir
2011-04-03T13:22:02  <simonstewart> Because everyone I know tries to use a firefox profile multiple times
2011-04-03T13:22:35  <simonstewart> So we could keep the file handle generated by layoutOnDisk somewhere
2011-04-03T13:22:47  <ahfeel> hi simonstewart
2011-04-03T13:22:50  <plightbo> probably doesn't make sense to do it on FirefoxProfile anymore though
2011-04-03T13:22:56  <plightbo> since that isn't mean to represent an actual profile
2011-04-03T13:22:58  <simonstewart> Oh, and look. We do keep that handle
2011-04-03T13:23:14  <simonstewart> In the NewProfileExtensionConnection
2011-04-03T13:23:17  <plightbo> yeah
2011-04-03T13:23:21  <plightbo> but how do you get _that_?
2011-04-03T13:23:30  <plightbo> i didn't see a getter anywhere for it?
2011-04-03T13:23:31  <ahfeel> simonstewart: I started to make the change to the atoms to use a two key object with no magic
2011-04-03T13:23:44  <simonstewart> Get the command executor from the firefox driver
2011-04-03T13:23:59  <simonstewart> And cast
2011-04-03T13:24:30  <simonstewart> Looks like you need one method added
2011-04-03T13:24:30  <plightbo> yeah
2011-04-03T13:24:38  <simonstewart> Which should take approximately 2 seconds
2011-04-03T13:24:39  <plightbo> it's just not as easy as it was before
2011-04-03T13:24:42  <plightbo> profile.getProfileDir() :)
2011-04-03T13:24:48  <plightbo> yeah it's really not a big deal
2011-04-03T13:24:51  <plightbo> just whining
2011-04-03T13:24:54  <plightbo> and giving you a hard time
2011-04-03T13:24:56  <simonstewart> It doesn't belong on the profile
2011-04-03T13:25:00  <plightbo> not anymore
2011-04-03T13:25:04  <simonstewart> just the extension connection
2011-04-03T13:25:05  <plightbo> you changed the concept of the profile
2011-04-03T13:25:05  <simonstewart> right
2011-04-03T13:25:13  <plightbo> it used to belong, back when the profile's job was different
2011-04-03T13:25:19  <simonstewart> Only to match user expectations
2011-04-03T13:25:26  <plightbo> bah, user's are stupid
2011-04-03T13:25:38  <plightbo> ironic, considering the misuse of the apostrophe just now
2011-04-03T13:25:40  <simonstewart> No comment
2011-04-03T13:25:58  <plightbo> anyway, it's all good
2011-04-03T13:26:17  <simonstewart> Feel free to modify the NEwProfileExtensionConnection
2011-04-03T13:26:17  <plightbo> bigger issue is why the heck my concoction isn't working. apparently AutomatedTester has the trick... just need to see what he's doing differently
2011-04-03T13:26:24  <plightbo> simonstewart: yeah, i'll probably patch it very minorly
2011-04-03T13:26:53  <ahfeel> simonstewart: but i'm a bit lost in the selenium project layout ;) I made changes to javascript/atoms and to javascript/selenium-atoms, plus a few things around in webdriver-atoms tests and selenium-core browserbot.js
2011-04-03T13:27:19  <simonstewart> ahfeel: at a conference right now, so not really paying much attention
2011-04-03T13:27:27  <simonstewart> feed me some context :)
2011-04-03T13:27:40  <AutomatedTester> the profile directory path is available in the .NET and Python code since its used in the binary code to set XRE_PROFILE_PATH
2011-04-03T13:27:59  <ahfeel> simonstewart: oh, okay :) well, you remember this but with modified Object.prototype that makes the locator fails
2011-04-03T13:28:06  <simonstewart> Right
2011-04-03T13:28:12  <simonstewart> I put in a fix for that earlier today
2011-04-03T13:28:14  <ahfeel> simonstewart: because they expect only one key in the object
2011-04-03T13:28:20  <ahfeel> oh really ? great !
2011-04-03T13:28:21  <simonstewart> Right
2011-04-03T13:28:23  <ahfeel> is that commited yet ?
2011-04-03T13:28:35  <simonstewart> r11867
2011-04-03T13:28:37  <selbot2> simon.m.stewart about 2 hours ago - SimonStewart: If the Object prototype has been modified, the atomic locators can fail. Guard against this condition - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11867
2011-04-03T13:28:47  <ahfeel> niiiiice that's awesome.
2011-04-03T13:29:00  <simonstewart> Let me know if it works for you :)
2011-04-03T13:29:03  <ahfeel> I'm gonna check that tomorrow at work then, sounds good, IE tests will work again o/
2011-04-03T13:29:29  <simonstewart> You'll need to compile the IE driver though
2011-04-03T13:29:36  <simonstewart> My windows machine is in another continent
2011-04-03T13:30:24  <ahfeel> ouch, does it requires any dev env on the window machine ?
2011-04-03T13:30:29  <simonstewart> so I've not updated the prebuilt DLLs
2011-04-03T13:30:36  <ahfeel> guess yes
2011-04-03T13:30:41  <simonstewart> For now
2011-04-03T13:30:50  <simonstewart> Once someone updates the prebuilts, you'll be fine
2011-04-03T13:30:56  <ahfeel> okay, well, i'll wait for that then
2011-04-03T13:30:58  <ahfeel> thanks ! :)
2011-04-03T13:31:04  <simonstewart> np
2011-04-03T13:32:05  <AutomatedTester> plightbo: let Shane and co know Navigation Timings Spec isnt in Firefox4
2011-04-03T13:32:19  <AutomatedTester> like their excerpt suggests
2011-04-03T13:32:27  <plightbo> yeah, i think we talked about that recently
2011-04-03T13:32:31  <plightbo> was a little bummed it didn't make it
2011-04-03T13:32:33  <plightbo> do you know why?
2011-04-03T13:33:26  <AutomatedTester> the patch stagnated and then when it started getting looked at was dropped from 4 since its not important enough for 4
2011-04-03T13:33:37  <AutomatedTester> but its looking like it will be in Firefox 5
2011-04-03T13:34:02  <plightbo> which is supposed to be pretty quick right?
2011-04-03T13:34:03  <AutomatedTester> p.s. Firefox is a few months away so dont be too bummed
2011-04-03T13:34:06  <simonstewart> Perhaps it could be a headline feature of 4.0.4?
2011-04-03T13:34:09  <plightbo> you guys want to be at FF 10 at the end of the year?
2011-04-03T13:34:17  <plightbo> or FF 9 or something?
2011-04-03T13:34:19  <AutomatedTester> 7 by the end of the year
2011-04-03T13:34:24  <plightbo> ah, close enough :)
2011-04-03T13:34:25  <AutomatedTester> FF7
2011-04-03T13:34:26  * simonstewart really hopes that there is a 4.0.4 release
2011-04-03T13:34:27  <plightbo> more than 5 :)
2011-04-03T13:34:38  <plightbo> is 4.0.3 already out?
2011-04-03T13:34:52  <simonstewart> I have no idea. 404 is web-funny though
2011-04-03T13:34:55  <AutomatedTester> but the Platform guys do not like the spec, its apparently too fluffy
2011-04-03T13:35:16  <AutomatedTester> but are working with the Spec writers
2011-04-03T13:35:19  <plightbo> AutomatedTester: well they are free to make something similar but better
2011-04-03T13:35:24  <plightbo> i can care less about the spec
2011-04-03T13:35:27  <plightbo> just need the concept in the browsers
2011-04-03T13:35:33  <plightbo> i can write JS that understands the differences
2011-04-03T13:35:42  <AutomatedTester> we want to use the spec
2011-04-03T13:35:44  <plightbo> it's not like there are 10+ vendors out there
2011-04-03T13:35:51  <AutomatedTester> we just want it nailed down a bit more
2011-04-03T13:35:55  <AutomatedTester> from my understanding
2011-04-03T13:35:59  <plightbo> well, i'd rather take a non-spec-compliant impl now than a spec-compliant one later
2011-04-03T13:36:05  <plightbo> it's really important :)
2011-04-03T13:36:12  <AutomatedTester> oh I know
2011-04-03T13:36:28  <AutomatedTester> it cuts me deep that its in IE9 and  not in FF4
2011-04-03T13:36:34  <simonstewart> This watir 3 stuff seems very jquery-ish
2011-04-03T13:36:43  <jarib> it is
2011-04-03T13:36:48  <simonstewart> lol
2011-04-03T13:37:19  <AutomatedTester> i read somewhere that the next ecmascript will be closer to jQuery

2011-04-03T13:38:38  <plightbo> what will it take for Selenium to stop doing Ruby bindings and send users to Watir? :)
2011-04-03T13:38:54  <AutomatedTester> plightbo: Se2
2011-04-03T13:38:59  <simonstewart> se2
2011-04-03T13:39:07  <AutomatedTester> snap!
2011-04-03T13:39:14  <plightbo> not sure what that means
2011-04-03T13:39:22  <plightbo> we are doing Se 2 Ruby bindings today, yes?
2011-04-03T13:39:35  <jarib> yes
2011-04-03T13:39:52  <plightbo> so i'm asking: what would it takes for us to stop developing those and instead recommend Watir?
2011-04-03T13:39:53  <jarib> and i've built a watir implementation on top of them; https://github.com/jarib/watir-webdriver
2011-04-03T13:40:18  <AutomatedTester> plightbo: Jarib does both
2011-04-03T13:40:22  <plightbo> basically, just officially say: "you want Ruby + Selenium? then you want Watir"
2011-04-03T13:40:34  <plightbo> and not even release publicly the Ruby bindings
2011-04-03T13:40:40  <jarib> the Ruby Se2 bindings are being used as a building block for several ruby tools
2011-04-03T13:40:46  <simonstewart> with se2 and watir-webdriver, watir becomes a layer over the webdriver apis
2011-04-03T13:40:47  <plightbo> or maybe release them but push Watir more
2011-04-03T13:40:53  <plightbo> i understand that :)
2011-04-03T13:40:54  <jarib> like capybara, which is widely popular
2011-04-03T13:41:00  <jarib> choice is good :)

2011-04-03T13:41:27  <plightbo> just seems kind of complex
2011-04-03T13:41:38  <plightbo> if I were a Ruby user I'd be a bit confused about which I should use
2011-04-03T13:41:43  <plightbo> would be nice if Selenium made a recommendation
2011-04-03T13:41:47  <simonstewart> once the webdriver api is implemented by browser vendors the complexity goes down
2011-04-03T13:41:48  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: are we still looking for an "in" at Microsoft?
2011-04-03T13:41:51  <simonstewart> Agreed with that

2011-04-03T13:46:41  <plightbo> only thing is right now it does it in memory
2011-04-03T13:46:47  <simonstewart> I could hug you
2011-04-03T13:46:48  <plightbo> which will cause a leak if your session is too long
2011-04-03T13:46:54  <simonstewart> Heh
2011-04-03T13:46:59  <plightbo> so we will want to flush it to disk as an optimization
2011-04-03T13:47:04  <plightbo> i've seen some REALLY large headers on some apps
2011-04-03T13:47:17  <simonstewart> right
2011-04-03T13:47:19  <plightbo> once saw a medium sized Se test eat up 60MB of freaking headers
2011-04-03T13:47:27  <simonstewart> wow
2011-04-03T13:47:31  <plightbo> yeah it was stupid
2011-04-03T13:47:38  <plightbo> their app server kept duplicating the cookies
2011-04-03T13:47:47  <plightbo> so by the end the cookies header was massive
2011-04-03T13:47:48  <simonstewart> Are you just capturing headers, or the entire request/reply?
2011-04-03T13:47:54  <plightbo> right now just headers
2011-04-03T13:48:01  <simonstewart> k
2011-04-03T13:48:13  <plightbo> gonna make headers and request/response be toggle-able soon
2011-04-03T13:48:22  <plightbo> also going to allow you to POST a request interceptor
2011-04-03T13:48:26  <simonstewart> Can I hook in things to mutate the requests or response?
2011-04-03T13:48:30  <plightbo> written in a little JS snippet
2011-04-03T13:48:32  <simonstewart> beat me to it :)
2011-04-03T13:48:34  <simonstewart> Very nice
2011-04-03T13:48:36  <plightbo> which will run it through Rhino
2011-04-03T13:48:41  <AutomatedTester> plightbo: if you fancy we can maybe pair up while you are here
2011-04-03T13:48:41  <plightbo> it's going to be beautiful :)
2011-04-03T13:48:45  <plightbo> would love it
2011-04-03T13:48:53  <simonstewart> Thursday hack day will be fun
2011-04-03T13:49:01  * AutomatedTester cant do the hack day
2011-04-03T13:49:05  <simonstewart> :(
2011-04-03T13:49:14  <simonstewart> We'll do a breakout session on selenium conf
2011-04-03T13:49:23  <AutomatedTester> I need to show my face at the All Hands
2011-04-03T13:49:26  <simonstewart> Though I'd like to show the speakers the respect of paying attention to them
2011-04-03T13:49:27  <AutomatedTester> :)
2011-04-03T13:49:30  <plightbo> yeah I leave Weds night :()

2011-04-03T13:50:18  <simonstewart> ohhh... bold suggestion here
2011-04-03T13:50:23  <simonstewart> I quite like it
2011-04-03T13:51:39  <plightbo> simonstewart: you plan your keynote talk yet?
2011-04-03T13:51:48  <plightbo> i need to talk to you and Jason about your topics
2011-04-03T13:51:51  <plightbo> so I can do mine :)
2011-04-03T13:51:52  <simonstewart> let's pretend I have
2011-04-03T13:51:53  <simonstewart> OK
2011-04-03T13:51:58  <plightbo> any preference on what I focus on?
2011-04-03T13:52:01  <simonstewart> When are you in SF?
2011-04-03T13:52:06  <simonstewart> (and when is Jason?)
2011-04-03T13:52:06  <plightbo> tomorrow night, 8:45PM
2011-04-03T13:52:28  <plightbo> also, should we get you-know-who that you-know-what for all her hard work?
2011-04-03T13:52:30  <simonstewart> You're missing the workshops?
2011-04-03T13:52:33  <plightbo> yeah :(
2011-04-03T13:52:39  <plightbo> had some meetings I couldn't get out of
2011-04-03T13:52:39  <simonstewart> yeah
2011-04-03T13:52:43  <simonstewart> Definitely
2011-04-03T13:52:46  <plightbo> ok... i will see if I can find one
2011-04-03T13:52:52  <plightbo> otherwise worst case we'll just order it
2011-04-03T13:53:00  <simonstewart> Or pre-order one and hand over a cardboard box
2011-04-03T13:53:03  <simonstewart> right
2011-04-03T13:55:50  <AutomatedTester> Hugs arrives tonight I think
2011-04-03T13:56:01  <simonstewart> Excellent

2011-04-03T13:56:17  <AutomatedTester> tonight I think
2011-04-03T13:56:33  <simonstewart> Excellent. We'll have the band in one place
2011-04-03T14:03:10  <plightbo> God bless Sitebricks

2011-04-03T14:03:21  <plightbo> that's how a web framework should work
2011-04-03T14:04:53  <simonstewart> I'll let dhanji know you like it
2011-04-03T14:06:33  <plightbo> yeah, not sure about their web/HTML stuff yet
2011-04-03T14:06:37  <plightbo> but the rest stuff is very nice
2011-04-03T14:06:58  <plightbo> completely sidesteps all the stupidity of WS-RS and JAXB and everything else that Sun kept spitting out
2011-04-03T14:07:05  <plightbo> i could never keep up with it anyway
2011-04-03T14:07:53  <simonstewart> I might rip out the tiny framework I have in the server then
2011-04-03T14:10:38  <plightbo> yeah it's pretty damn good
2011-04-03T14:16:46  <simonstewart> wondering how to declare a value object type in xpcom's idl

2011-04-03T14:47:59  *** gronky has joined #selenium
2011-04-03T14:55:38  <AutomatedTester> i hate finding bugs in my code
2011-04-03T14:57:40  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: is there a statically linked xpidl available for OS X
2011-04-03T14:57:41  <simonstewart> ?
2011-04-03T14:57:58  <AutomatedTester> pass but I know where to look
2011-04-03T14:58:42  <simonstewart> It's stopping me from working more :)
2011-04-03T14:58:57  <AutomatedTester> have you looked at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XPIDL ?
2011-04-03T14:58:58  <simonstewart> I really don't want to install "ports" on my mac
2011-04-03T14:59:12  <simonstewart> yes i have
2011-04-03T14:59:18  <AutomatedTester> ahh right
2011-04-03T14:59:34  <simonstewart> The main problem is this: "xpidl is based on the libIDL idl compiler from the Gnome project. The libIDL compiler depends on glib, also from the gnome project."
2011-04-03T15:00:02  <simonstewart> (this, btw, is why we have the prebuilt binary components for firefox)
2011-04-03T15:00:30  <AutomatedTester> it would be part of the SDK?
2011-04-03T15:00:36  <AutomatedTester> for Gecko?
2011-04-03T15:00:39  <simonstewart> It is, but when you run it, you get this warning:
2011-04-03T15:00:54  <simonstewart> "dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libIDL-2.0.dylib"
2011-04-03T15:01:02  <simonstewart> Which is why I want a statically linked version
2011-04-03T15:02:25  <simonstewart> This page gives one solution: http://thedot.zlatari.net/post/277374637/running-xpidl-on-snow-leopard

2011-04-03T15:06:16  <AutomatedTester> everything internal I am finding is ports related
2011-04-03T15:06:29  <AutomatedTester> but let me see if there is a brew recipe
2011-04-03T15:07:29  <AutomatedTester> i am seeing if bz is available
2011-04-03T15:08:19  <AutomatedTester> bz is essentially our in house human super computer
2011-04-03T15:08:28  <simonstewart> heh
2011-04-03T15:08:35  <simonstewart> brew is better than ports
2011-04-03T15:08:42  <simonstewart> I'd still prefer neither :)
2011-04-03T15:08:54  <AutomatedTester> soz
2011-04-03T15:09:02  <simonstewart> meh
2011-04-03T15:09:07  <AutomatedTester> i cant find anything that might be useful

2011-04-03T15:21:49  <simonstewart> no
2011-04-03T15:21:56  <simonstewart> :)

2011-04-03T15:22:24  <adamgoucher> (or is the number like 2 000 000 for google?)
2011-04-03T15:22:47  <simonstewart> We try not to make our users be testers
2011-04-03T15:23:20  <adamgoucher> the company i have an office at is building a facebook app -- wednesday is an angry day in the office
2011-04-03T15:23:30  <simonstewart> why wednesday?
2011-04-03T15:23:39  <AutomatedTester> Tuesday is release day
2011-04-03T15:23:39  <adamgoucher> facebook ships tuesday night

2011-04-03T15:57:09  <plightbo> woo
2011-04-03T15:57:19  <plightbo> ok, calling it quits on bm-proxy for now
2011-04-03T15:57:26  <plightbo> it auto detects the user-agent
2011-04-03T15:57:35  <plightbo> just need to add some APIs to break up the HAR and HAR Pages
2011-04-03T15:57:36  <simonstewart> cool
2011-04-03T15:58:06  <plightbo> and then after that do request manipulation via Rhino and add optional header/body capture
2011-04-03T15:58:09  <plightbo> then it's truly done
2011-04-03T15:58:14  <plightbo> for 1.0, that is
2011-04-03T15:59:15  <AutomatedTester> plightbo: where did you get a netexport for Fx4?
2011-04-03T15:59:25  <plightbo> AutomatedTester: i didn't
2011-04-03T15:59:32  <plightbo> i haven't bothered with FF4
2011-04-03T15:59:36  <AutomatedTester> oh
2011-04-03T15:59:40  <AutomatedTester> ok...
2011-04-03T15:59:58  <AutomatedTester> well I have it working with Fx3.6 in Python definitely
2011-04-03T16:00:12  <plightbo> cool
2011-04-03T16:00:21  <AutomatedTester> i will hack the xpi to work with Fx4
2011-04-03T16:00:29  <plightbo> would you mind sharing your code with mark.watson@neustar.biz and shane.hender@neustar.biz and copying me
2011-04-03T16:00:37  <plightbo> the three of us are hacking around with some of that same stuff today
2011-04-03T16:00:51  <plightbo> i also told them to email you if they had any breakthroughs

2011-04-03T16:01:55  <AutomatedTester> onto IRC into this channel
2011-04-03T16:02:03  <plightbo> oh i think they are getting on an airplane right now
2011-04-03T16:02:06  <plightbo> flying to SF tonight
2011-04-03T16:02:10  <AutomatedTester> right
2011-04-03T16:02:26  <AutomatedTester> if they do my workshop they will get the code :P
2011-04-03T16:03:56  <jarib> plightbo: seen my HAR gem btw? https://github.com/jarib/har
2011-04-03T16:04:09  <jarib> lets you do `har /path/to.har`
2011-04-03T16:04:22  <jarib> and it will create a server with the viewer and open your browser there
2011-04-03T16:04:40  <plightbo> what do you mean "creates a server"?
2011-04-03T16:05:51  <plightbo> jarib: i was just using http://www.softwareishard.com/har/viewer/
2011-04-03T16:05:55  <plightbo> is your gem similar?
2011-04-03T16:06:22  <jarib> the gem includes that viewer code
2011-04-03T16:06:39  <simonstewart> plightbo: woo!
2011-04-03T16:07:08  <jarib> so when you do `har <path>` it will launch a small ruby server on localhost serving the viewer for that har (or merge them if you give it several files)
2011-04-03T16:07:46  <plightbo> got it
2011-04-03T16:08:00  <plightbo> does it use the same HAR viewer UI?
2011-04-03T16:08:03  <plightbo> or you have your own thing?
2011-04-03T16:08:13  <simonstewart> I appear to be compiling Firefox
2011-04-03T16:08:29  <simonstewart> This is one hairy yak
2011-04-03T16:08:35  <jarib> plightbo: yes, it uses the same
2011-04-03T16:08:44  <jarib> i asked if i could just include his code in the gem
2011-04-03T16:09:05  <plightbo> we're going to be releasing a different HAR viewer as a jQuery plugin
2011-04-03T16:09:12  <jarib> it could definitely be improved though, especially when it comes to a bunch of requests
2011-04-03T16:09:13  <plightbo> I like his, but it's hard to embed easily
2011-04-03T16:09:18  <jarib> sounds cool
2011-04-03T16:09:23  <jarib> who are "we"?
2011-04-03T16:09:30  <plightbo> Team BrowserMob
2011-04-03T16:09:39  <jarib> aye
2011-04-03T16:10:01  <plightbo> you can see an example of it by going here:
2011-04-03T16:10:01  <plightbo> http://browsermob.com/benchmarks/item/143#2/1301786208963/1301872608963
2011-04-03T16:10:05  <plightbo> and then clicking on a data point
2011-04-03T16:10:37  <plightbo> ok, i'm gone for a while
2011-04-03T16:10:40  <jarib> nice

2011-04-03T23:12:34  <plightbo> right now it groups everything in to a single page named PageRef_1
2011-04-03T23:12:48  <plightbo> that'll get fixed tomorrow
2011-04-03T23:13:09  <plightbo> also i don't know if Maven is packaging it up nicely as a jar-of-jars yet
2011-04-03T23:13:25  <plightbo> so easiest thing to do is open in an IDE and run org.browsermob.proxy.Main
2011-04-03T23:13:31  <plightbo> after that POST to /proxy
2011-04-03T23:13:41  <plightbo> and then GET /proxy/9091/har
2011-04-03T23:13:50  <plightbo> and point the browser to port 9091
2011-04-03T23:13:58  <plightbo> to start capturing some data
2011-04-03T23:14:03  <plightbo> i'm off to bed. talk to you guys tomorrow
