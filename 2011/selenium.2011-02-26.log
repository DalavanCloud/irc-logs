2011-02-26T10:31:09  *** kylls has quit IRC
2011-02-26T10:40:13  *** tester has joined #selenium
2011-02-26T10:41:52  <tester> have installed selenium on Ubuntu server with no X server - and have problems getting it to work - any sugestions ?
2011-02-26T10:43:14  <ato> I don't know the other Selenium implementations that well, but aren't they using native input?  Meaning that you'll probably have to run the browser in an X framebuffer.
2011-02-26T10:43:40  <tester> Ok - thansk
2011-02-26T10:43:40  <tester> thanks
2011-02-26T10:43:47  <ian_mac> tester, Selenium doesn't need an X server, but your browser probably does
2011-02-26T10:44:01  <ian_mac> providing an error message though would probably make it easier for others to help you also
2011-02-26T10:44:23  <tester> so how can I get it if I don't have install rights on the server
2011-02-26T10:44:42  <ato> In our testing system we run the browser in a virtual framebuffer on :8.
2011-02-26T10:45:04  <ian_mac> you could probably run Xvfb or xvnc without install rights
2011-02-26T10:45:18  <ian_mac> if not then you're probably out of luck
2011-02-26T10:45:41  <tester> have tried echo $DISPLAY but it don't returns anything
2011-02-26T10:46:24  <ian_mac> so thne you probably have to set that variable so that Firefox knows where to find an xserver
2011-02-26T10:46:28  <ian_mac> (or whatever browser you're using)
2011-02-26T10:46:39  <ian_mac> what exactly are you trying to test?
2011-02-26T10:46:44  <ian_mac> you could try using htmlunit
2011-02-26T10:47:36  <tester> Trying to create a system that extracts info from a rss feed (remote) for transmitting it to a SMS gateway
2011-02-26T10:48:18  <ato> Wouldn't it jsut be easier to pull down the RSS feed in question instead?
2011-02-26T10:49:10  <ian_mac> oh I would not use Selenium for that
2011-02-26T10:49:13  <ian_mac> use CURL
2011-02-26T10:49:31  <tester> It is part of a bigger project and we are supposed to do it this way - but guess I must get the sysadmin to look at the server
2011-02-26T10:49:45  <ian_mac> you are supposed to do it using Selenium?
2011-02-26T10:50:06  <tester> will look at CURL but yes we should do it with selenium
2011-02-26T10:50:12  <ato> wget'ing down the resource instead would be much easier.
2011-02-26T10:50:47  <ian_mac> that just seems...  wrong...
2011-02-26T10:50:59  <ian_mac> it's going to be much heavier and much less reliable using Selenium
2011-02-26T10:51:00  <tester> It is first iteration - learning to use Selenium - next phase will be more advanced
2011-02-26T10:51:02  <ato> Why wrong?  Aren't you just trying to parse it?
2011-02-26T10:51:09  <ato> Oh.
2011-02-26T10:51:16  <ian_mac> ato, I meant using Selenium seems wrong
2011-02-26T10:51:30  <ian_mac> if the goal is to learn Selenium, I guess it's different
2011-02-26T10:51:32  <ian_mac> oh well
2011-02-26T10:51:33  <ian_mac> whatever
2011-02-26T10:52:01  <ato> Depending on which browser(s) you plan to run this fetching of RSS feeds on, the browser might have different ways of rendering the feeds.
2011-02-26T10:52:10  <tester> OK - thanks for everything folks ! - will look more into it
2011-02-26T10:52:28  <ato> WebKit and Opera will display the feed formatted in an HTML page, and not the XML code itself.
