2011-02-17T02:39:57  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: ping...
2011-02-17T02:40:17  <AutomatedTester> wonders if he will be working late again
2011-02-17T02:41:48  <jarib> AutomatedTester: sorry, lost my connection last night
2011-02-17T02:41:54  <jarib> seems to happen sometimes around midnight
2011-02-17T02:42:06  <AutomatedTester> jarib: no worries, I was tired and went to bed
2011-02-17T02:42:36  <jarib> unfortunately, the fact that you couldn't reproduce with a MS-built python doesn't really narrow it down
2011-02-17T02:42:54  <jarib> it would be cool if you could try the screenshot thing as well
2011-02-17T02:42:56  <jarib> it's much simpler :)
2011-02-17T02:43:57  <AutomatedTester> test case for me to repo?
2011-02-17T02:44:17  <jarib> #1271
2011-02-17T02:44:18  <selbot2> jari.bakken open/accepted IE driver hangs on exit after taking screenshot - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1271
2011-02-17T02:44:22  <jarib> see the gist there
2011-02-17T02:44:44  <AutomatedTester> ok, just need to look at something else first and then will build a python version
2011-02-17T02:45:01  <jarib> cool. it's just 4 lines :)
2011-02-17T02:53:04  <AutomatedTester> sigh... that didnt break

2011-02-17T03:12:37  <AutomatedTester> jarib: what is the issue with Ruby->IEDriver?
2011-02-17T03:12:48  <jarib> it hangs at exit if you take a screenshot
2011-02-17T03:12:56  <jarib> all of ruby's at_exit hooks finish, then it just hangs
2011-02-17T03:13:18  <AutomatedTester> wfm
2011-02-17T03:13:19  <AutomatedTester> soz
2011-02-17T03:13:22  <jarib> and we can't reproduce with other langs
2011-02-17T03:13:37  <jarib> well, if the screenshot code isn't working, then you might not hit the same case
2011-02-17T03:13:45  <jarib> if i don't take the screenshot, it exits fine
2011-02-17T03:13:51  <AutomatedTester> it is working...
2011-02-17T03:13:54  <AutomatedTester> the writing to disk isnt
2011-02-17T03:14:12  <AutomatedTester> if I get the base64 version I get the string
2011-02-17T03:14:13  <jarib> hmm
2011-02-17T03:14:19  <jarib> let me see if that will reproduce
2011-02-17T03:14:24  <jarib> (not saving)
2011-02-17T03:14:49  <AutomatedTester> let me explain better because I am doing a really bad job of it
2011-02-17T03:15:16  <AutomatedTester> the decoding from base64 to PNG isnt producing a viewable image
2011-02-17T03:15:19  <AutomatedTester> the png is on the disk
2011-02-17T03:15:22  <AutomatedTester> but I cant see it
2011-02-17T03:15:51  <jarib> ah
2011-02-17T03:16:17  <jarib> ok, it hangs even if i don't save
2011-02-17T03:17:38  <[530]> I get this blank popup when I try to select a popup in ie8 on windows7, so can't get anythong done in the popup I want, got a screenshot http://imagebin.org/138392
2011-02-17T03:18:10  <[530]> using the python driver
2011-02-17T03:20:03  <AutomatedTester> ahh popups...
2011-02-17T03:22:01  <[530]> but it all works in firefox.. is not window.open overridden properly or something? also windows have no id's in ie8 only names
2011-02-17T03:23:12  <AutomatedTester> hmm
2011-02-17T03:23:26  <AutomatedTester> [530]: lemme pull up the bindings quickly
2011-02-17T03:24:23  <AutomatedTester> [530]: try select window instead
2011-02-17T03:24:38  <[530]> did that too..
2011-02-17T03:24:42  <AutomatedTester> selenium.select_window("name=windowname")
2011-02-17T03:24:43  <[530]> no effect
2011-02-17T03:24:46  <AutomatedTester> oh
2011-02-17T03:24:58  <[530]> i'll try again..
2011-02-17T03:25:05  <[530]> dod not use name=
2011-02-17T03:25:11  <[530]> did
2011-02-17T03:25:21  <AutomatedTester> i am just reading the docstring so dunno if it will work
2011-02-17T03:27:03  <AutomatedTester> jarib: this IEDriver stuff, could it be a bug in Ruby/COM Interop?
2011-02-17T03:27:13  <AutomatedTester> and the bindings are exposing it?
2011-02-17T03:28:23  <[530]> AutomatedTester: no effect
2011-02-17T03:28:56  <AutomatedTester> hmmm
2011-02-17T03:29:10  <AutomatedTester> well there appears to be an old bug, just looking it up
2011-02-17T03:29:24  <AutomatedTester> but it suggests that sometimes it cant get the window.open
2011-02-17T03:29:36  <AutomatedTester> in that case fire a open_window
2011-02-17T03:30:00  <[530]> so make a open_window in my js?
2011-02-17T03:30:19  <jarib> AutomatedTester: ruby is just using ffi to launch the server. no COM stuff being done from ruby directly
2011-02-17T03:30:38  <jarib> i wrote a c extension to eliminate ffi as the cause, didn't help
2011-02-17T03:30:53  <AutomatedTester> [530]: in the test, let me get the bug first
2011-02-17T03:31:21  <AutomatedTester> [530]: http://jira.openqa.org/browse/SEL-339
2011-02-17T03:33:24  <AutomatedTester> jarib: python is doing COM Interop
2011-02-17T03:34:06  <[530]> AutomatedTester: That is onload, this one is opened by onclick on a link
2011-02-17T03:34:56  <AutomatedTester> [530]: dunno then if its not selecting it
2011-02-17T03:36:21  <[530]> where can i see the code that does the overriding, new to java and selenium..
2011-02-17T03:36:24  <[530]> ?

2011-02-17T08:26:12  <RossPatterson> XPather will do the find for you too - just right click on the element, choose Show in XPather.
2011-02-17T08:27:26  <lawcab> after I do the Show Xpather
2011-02-17T08:27:38  <lawcab> I should do Inner HTML/XML
2011-02-17T08:28:01  <RossPatterson> Show in XPather
2011-02-17T08:28:45  <RossPatterson> "Show in XPather" will give you an XPath in the main window.  You can also choose one of the selected elements and then see other XPaths in the XPath tab.
2011-02-17T08:30:06  <lawcab> can i convert a cssselector to xpath

2011-02-17T08:41:40  <RossPatterson> lawcab: That depends on the specific items in the XPath.  For many XPaths, yes.
2011-02-17T08:42:13  <lawcab> so let us say I am trying to get the xpath for an input
2011-02-17T08:42:21  <RossPatterson> Sorry, I answered the question backwards.  Yes, I believe almost all CSS locators can be converted to XPath.
2011-02-17T08:42:38  <RossPatterson> Got a concrete example?
2011-02-17T08:42:41  <lawcab> <input xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" type="image" tabindex="11" alt="Create Account" src="/images/servlets/SignOn/createaccount.gif" />
2011-02-17T08:43:09  <RossPatterson> So how would you code the CSS selector for that?
2011-02-17T08:43:32  <AutomatedTester> RossPatterson: only xpath that can't, as far as I know, are ones that walk the tree backwards
2011-02-17T08:44:51  <lawcab> [src="/images/servlets/SignOn/createaccount.gif"]
2011-02-17T08:44:53  *** retornam has joined #selenium
2011-02-17T08:46:02  <RossPatterson> AutomatedTester: I think some of the more sophisticated XPath functions have no CSS equivalent (e.g., translate(), not(), and all of the numerics).
2011-02-17T08:46:18  <AutomatedTester> yea
2011-02-17T08:47:04  <RossPatterson> lawcab: So the XPath equivalent would be //*[@src="/images/servlets/SignOn/createaccount.gif"], which means "any element at any depth in the document that has an SRC attribute that is /images/...".
2011-02-17T08:47:36  <lawcab> ok
2011-02-17T08:47:55  <lawcab> so from that i can now use the functions
2011-02-17T08:48:21  <RossPatterson> lawcab: You might find //input[contains(@src, "/images/servlets/SignOn/createaccount.gif")] to be both a little faster and a little more resilient.

2011-02-17T09:05:22  <jarib> fission6: "i can visibly see" isn't good enough - it's very likely not visible at the point in time selenium tries to use it
2011-02-17T09:05:34  <jarib> so you probably need to wait for it to become visible

2011-02-17T14:36:22  <jimevans> Yeah, but if Java itself is crashing, it's almost guaranteed that there's some native code happening somewhere.

2011-02-17T14:40:19  <AutomatedTester> did you and jarib get any closer with the ruby stuff?
2011-02-17T14:40:44  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: haven't look at it since yesterday. i'm cleaning up some IE7 bits right now.
2011-02-17T14:41:02  <AutomatedTester> fair enough

2011-02-17T14:41:54  <KirillJacobson> It crashases consistently while waiting for page to load. I know it is in the native code. I recompiled the new driver and can insert debug statments but i would prefer to ctreate a c# unit test and step through c++ in dev env. There are oter minor issues with the new code that i may fix along the way like temp

2011-02-17T14:43:23  <KirillJacobson> Driver dll not deleted after the test (filemon shows that delete fails because th is locked)
2011-02-17T14:43:49  <KirillJacobson> (sorry for spelling
2011-02-17T14:44:21  <jimevans> KirillJacobson: Okay, that's a Java-specific thing. Using C# to find that problem won't work.
2011-02-17T14:44:25  <KirillJacobson> Tiping on iphone because irc is blocked in the office)
2011-02-17T14:44:40  <jimevans> You should be able to use C# to try to debug the crash, though.
2011-02-17T14:45:07  <jimevans> As a tip, though, create your test in a console application, and attach the debugger to it.
2011-02-17T14:45:14  <jimevans> Don't try to step through the managed code.
2011-02-17T14:45:42  <jimevans> Sorry, attach the debugger to it to *only* debug native code.

2011-02-17T14:52:28  <jimevans> KirillJacobson: The "unit tests" are really "integration tests". They require a working web server. The test .jar provides that.
2011-02-17T14:53:08  <jimevans> Did "go //dotnet:ie-test" not work?

2011-02-17T14:57:21  <jimevans> I'll be around off-and-on tomorrow during the workday. I probably know more about the C++ code in the IE driver than anyone else at the moment.

2011-02-17T15:07:05  <KirillJacobson> One more Q if you havent left yet. When i run Shoud open and xlose browser repeatedly test the IE comes up with an alert window - message from webpage - http localhost 1808. This alert prevents vrowser to close at the end of the test. How to disable the alert or kill it? It seems that ths alert always pops up for any page. I searched the code and couldn't find it. Thank you. Kirilll
2011-02-17T15:08:57  <jimevans> KirillJacobson: That sounds like a JavaScript alert(). I've never seen that before on "any page".
2011-02-17T15:09:25  <jimevans> Also, if you haven't already done so, you'll need to set the protected mode settings to be the same value for all zones (on or off).
