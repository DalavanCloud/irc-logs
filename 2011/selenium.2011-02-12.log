2011-02-12T12:32:32  <jarib> i think i have a few more, hold on
2011-02-12T12:33:04  <jarib> actually, the links at the bottom of that page
2011-02-12T12:33:25  <jarib> the 5-part series there is pretty good
2011-02-12T12:33:55  <adamgoucher> thanks. have a week to learn rspec
2011-02-12T12:34:04  * adamgoucher chuckles at the silliness of that statement
2011-02-12T12:35:28  <adamgoucher> one thing i don't (yet) get with rspec is how to share before/after across files
2011-02-12T12:37:10  <jarib> there's before(:suite) et al
2011-02-12T12:37:17  <jarib> which you can do in your spec_helper.rb
2011-02-12T12:37:32  <jarib> RSpec.configure { |c| c.before(:suite) { ... } }
2011-02-12T12:37:36  <jarib> (for rspec 2)

2011-02-12T12:40:12  <jarib> although those tests open and close the browser for each test
2011-02-12T12:40:20  <adamgoucher> ah. page 224 of the rspec book :)
2011-02-12T12:40:22  <jarib> which makes me not want to run them very often :P
2011-02-12T12:40:41  <jarib> yeah, that's probably a good resource
2011-02-12T12:40:48  * adamgoucher is convinced the that the trick to learning something is the index/google keyword
2011-02-12T12:41:16  <jarib> yeah, except when things change rapidly. does the book cover rspec 1 or 2?
2011-02-12T12:43:28  <adamgoucher> 2 i think. pretty sure i saw the tagging stuff in there
2011-02-12T12:43:43  <adamgoucher> ya, 2 (sayeth the back cover)

2011-02-12T16:24:46  <mcbluebeard> I'm using selenium rc via the python library.  Curious how I can select an artibitrary dom element and then inspect its various properties.
2011-02-12T16:30:58  <jarib> adamgoucher: perhaps if consultants in the know would push it a little.. :)

2011-02-12T17:13:47  <mandric> is there anything you can see wrong about this locator? //*[contains(@class,'main-cs-phone')][2]
2011-02-12T17:14:23  <mandric> i imagine it would select the second element with main-cs-phone in the class attr?
2011-02-12T17:14:53  <mandric> yet selenium tells me it is not found.
2011-02-12T17:16:00  <mandric> yet a get_xpath_count on //*[contains(@class,'main-cs-phone')] tells me there are 3 elements.
2011-02-12T17:23:37  <adamgoucher> jarib: if there was a migration path from rc -> wd, in all languages, for all browsers. and if it was feature comparible then consultants might push harder :)
2011-02-12T17:24:21  <adamgoucher> do xpath=(//*[contains(@class,'main-cs-phone')])[2]

2011-02-12T18:12:24  <mandric_> adamgoucher: hrm no luck with that
2011-02-12T18:12:33  <mandric_> this works sel.get_xpath_count("//*[contains(@class,'%s')]" % cls )
2011-02-12T18:13:01  <mandric_> this works only for the first element ... sel.get_text("//*[contains(@class,'%s')][%s]" % (cls, idx))
2011-02-12T18:13:36  <mandric_> so from the count i get 3 but then the loop fails with no elment found for foo[2]
2011-02-12T18:14:24  <adamgoucher> sel.get_text("xpath=(//*[contains(@class,'%s')])[%s]" % (cls, idx))
2011-02-12T18:14:34  <adamgoucher> putting it in ()s makes it a list
2011-02-12T18:14:41  <adamgoucher> (for all intents and purposes)
2011-02-12T18:14:41  <mandric_> hrm i tried that too
2011-02-12T18:14:45  <mandric_> just now
2011-02-12T18:14:53  <mandric_> will try again with the xpath=
2011-02-12T18:15:26  <mandric_> oh
2011-02-12T18:15:42  <mandric_> i had the paren in the wrong page i think ... let's try
2011-02-12T18:16:56  <mandric_>  Element (//*[contains(@class,'main-cs-phone')])[1] not found
