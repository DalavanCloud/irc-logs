2011-03-03T09:08:49  <jimevans> Among the guidelines are recommendations disabling copy constructors/assignment operators, and the use of std::tr1::shared_ptr
2011-03-03T09:09:20  <simonstewart> the smart pointer thing is a good diea
2011-03-03T09:09:23  <simonstewart> idea
2011-03-03T09:09:25  <simonstewart> even
2011-03-03T09:09:30  <jimevans> These guidelines are particularly important to me, because I store the native code objects in STL collections.
2011-03-03T09:09:45  <simonstewart> Makes sense
2011-03-03T09:09:58  <simonstewart> I'm still hunting for someone who'll actually *do* the damnable code reviews
2011-03-03T09:12:17  <jimevans> So where I'm running into confusion is this: would it be better to store my objects by value in the collections (in which case I need copy constructors and assignment operators),
2011-03-03T09:12:19  <jimevans> or store pointers (which makes it difficult to follow the guidelines on "pass arguments to functions by const reference where possible")?
2011-03-03T09:12:53  <jimevans> This is just my plain C++ ignorance showing.
2011-03-03T09:13:18  <simonstewart> I have no idea. Asking around

2011-03-03T09:13:35  <jimevans> :)
2011-03-03T09:14:05  <jimevans> Part of the motivation for this is to make it easier for Googlers to review the code (standard style and all that).
2011-03-03T09:14:19  <antlong> jimevans, it might be worth your while to look in to cpython or cython
2011-03-03T09:14:25  <eranm> jimevans, definitely what kind of objects?

2011-03-03T09:15:25  <eranm> jimevans, Simon just told me it's the element wrappers
2011-03-03T09:15:35  <jimevans> eranm: Yep, and browser wrappers too.
2011-03-03T09:16:12  <jimevans> antlong: I guess my question is more along the lines of, "This helps me how?"

2011-03-03T09:16:32  <eranm> so if it it only contains a couple of data fields which can be copied properly (as is the case with COM pointers, I believe) you can pass them by value and have them copied
2011-03-03T09:16:48  <eranm> (as long as the copy constructor is appropriate)
2011-03-03T09:17:08  <jimevans> eranm: Yeah, I'm coming 'round to that realization.
2011-03-03T09:17:15  <eranm> Although I'd recommend avoiding copying collections and pass a const reference to the collection
2011-03-03T09:17:38  <simonstewart> Can't we use CComPtrs for passing COM objects around?
2011-03-03T09:17:42  <jimevans> that's one of the things I'm hacking about on right now.
2011-03-03T09:17:50  <simonstewart> Damn you guys are good

2011-03-03T09:19:17  <jimevans> simonstewart: We do use CComPtr, for the most part, where applicable.
2011-03-03T09:19:22  <eranm> antlong, because void* and malloc are more fun? :)

2011-03-03T09:20:18  <jimevans> I did notice some trouble with things falling out of scope with elements though, but that was early on. I might have resolved those particular issues by now.
2011-03-03T09:20:20  <simonstewart> I remember being most pleased when I learned of them
2011-03-03T09:20:24  <eranm> jimevans, I'd argue that even if you're modifying the collection you're better off passing a reference.

2011-03-03T09:37:57  <jarib> it immediately fetches the value. i think that's the problem

2011-03-03T09:40:56  *** Trees_ has joined #selenium
2011-03-03T09:41:30  <jarib> it sends keystrokes to a div and logs it to another element on keypress
2011-03-03T09:41:30  <simonstewart> It's possible that the focus event hasn't fired by the time we start typing....

2011-03-03T09:43:45  <jimevans> hi ahfeel.
2011-03-03T09:44:06  <ahfeel> jimevans: we're having strange issue with b2 (works in a7 and b1) with IE xpath selectors
2011-03-03T09:44:34  <ahfeel> basically, By.xpath("//span[@name='doRemoveSecurityProvider']") does not work anymore
2011-03-03T09:44:37  <ahfeel> while
2011-03-03T09:44:38  <jarib> ah, it doesn't work with FF on Windows either. works perfectly on OS X. so definitely an issue in the native code.
2011-03-03T09:44:41  <ahfeel> By.xpath("//span[contains(@name, 'doRemoveSecurityProvider')]") still works

2011-03-03T09:45:07  *** simonstewart has joined #selenium
2011-03-03T09:45:07  *** eranm has joined #selenium
2011-03-03T09:45:14  <ahfeel> and another thing, the reason we're using xpath instead of By.Name is because xpathes are MUCH faster on IE than By.Name, which is another issue :-)
2011-03-03T09:45:20  <jimevans> ahfeel: that's strange. there weren't any changes between b1 and b2 for xpath in IE that I'm aware of.
2011-03-03T09:46:14  <ahfeel> we tried to reproduce it on a simple test case, but failed... we can provide access to the application and run from the trunk if you want to hack a session with us to try to figure out what's wrong
2011-03-03T09:46:30  <jarib> here's the script https://gist.github.com/853175
2011-03-03T09:46:54  <ahfeel> it's just a matter of setting a time so we can be fully available fo ryou
2011-03-03T09:46:55  <jarib> on OS X it prints 11, on windows 0
2011-03-03T09:47:03  <jimevans> ahfeel: the performance thing must be an automation atom issue.
2011-03-03T09:47:15  *** Trees- has joined #selenium
2011-03-03T09:47:23  <jimevans> finding by name should be tons faster than finding by xpath in ie.
2011-03-03T09:47:42  <ahfeel> mh, well, we did not compare again with b2
2011-03-03T09:47:52  <ahfeel> and i think things changed a lot with b2 on this side
2011-03-03T09:48:02  <ahfeel> so maybe By.name is much faster now than before ?
2011-03-03T09:48:28  *** Trees_ has quit IRC
2011-03-03T09:48:34  <jimevans> finding by name should always have been faster than by xpath in IE.
2011-03-03T09:48:55  <ahfeel> ah.. well it's really not the case, and by a huge order of magnitude :/
2011-03-03T09:49:06  <ahfeel> (at least on our application)
2011-03-03T09:49:17  <jimevans> the biggest change between a7 and b1 was refactoring IE to be a subclass of RemoteWebDriver.
2011-03-03T09:49:28  <jimevans> The change between b1 and b2 was to make the IE driver use the automation atoms.
2011-03-03T09:50:22  <ahfeel> okay
2011-03-03T09:50:53  <jimevans> simonstewart: can you think of any reason why finding by name should be much slower than finding by xpath in ie?

2011-03-03T12:07:22  <RossPatterson> I'd assume IDE, since any real language has plenty of timing constructs.
2011-03-03T12:07:34  <lds_kevinhomer> yes.... correct
2011-03-03T12:07:35  <RossPatterson> This sounds like a job foe getEval
2011-03-03T12:07:40  <RossPatterson> s/foe/for/
2011-03-03T12:08:19  <RossPatterson> Sorry, my brain's stuck in RC.  I meant "storeEval"
2011-03-03T12:14:32  <andytinkham1> Argh! Getting this iphone driver working is driving me nuts

2011-03-03T12:45:53  <Archdude> you just use JS to generate time/date
2011-03-03T12:46:23  <Archdude> lookup how to do it in JS and wrap it in javascript{ } using store

2011-03-03T12:50:00  <Archdude> hold on i'll find you an example
2011-03-03T12:52:58  <lds_kevinhomer> k..... ty
2011-03-03T12:53:09  <Archdude> ok
2011-03-03T12:53:11  <Archdude> javascript{var myday = new Date();myday.setDate(myday.getDate()+1);myday.getFullYear()}
2011-03-03T12:53:55  <Archdude> if you stored that as the target
2011-03-03T12:53:57  <Archdude> you'd have the year
2011-03-03T12:54:49  *** kylls has quit IRC
2011-03-03T12:56:11  <lds_kevinhomer> that looks like a good example when using JS. A followup question (from this noob).... When using native Selenese, how does one integrate this JS script into the selense code?
2011-03-03T12:56:36  <lds_kevinhomer> without loosing the ability to continue to use selenese?...
2011-03-03T12:57:40  <Archdude> are you talking about only using the selenium IDE plugin?
2011-03-03T12:58:05  <Archdude> entering it into there?
2011-03-03T12:58:48  <Archdude> the example i gave you if for IDE
2011-03-03T12:59:18  <Archdude> when you write scripts in html, you can use JS to generate random numbers, times, dates etc
2011-03-03T13:00:09  <lds_kevinhomer> Yes, attempting to just use IDE whenever possible
2011-03-03T13:00:51  <lds_kevinhomer> if that works in the IDE, then I'll do some more research to learn how to use that. I'd love to have JS capabilities in the current scripts that we have.
2011-03-03T13:01:07  <Archdude> just wrap JS in javascript{ }
