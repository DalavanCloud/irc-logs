2011-05-01T21:16:49  <DarkRift> someone any good with selenium grid ? I have a stupid question, when trying to run a new class on the grid, does all the slave RC need to have the jar containing that new class in it or is the grid sending the new class to the slaves ?
2011-05-01T21:18:38  <DarkRift> because I receive a message in the console stating that it cannot instantiate the class I'm trying to test, even tho it has the same parameters of the demo class com.thoughtworks.selenium.grid.demo.WebTestInvolvingMultiEnvironments
2011-05-01T21:49:12  *** pnitin has joined #selenium
2011-05-01T22:01:03  *** erwandf has joined #selenium
2011-05-01T22:01:07  <eghm> DarkRift: no just the one you are running the test from.  Commands get sent from there to the others.
2011-05-01T22:02:41  <DarkRift> so I need to reload the slave RC with the new jar containing the new test class ?
2011-05-01T22:03:02  <eghm> no
2011-05-01T22:03:07  <DarkRift> hummm
2011-05-01T22:03:15  <DarkRift> then I wonder what might the cause of the error
2011-05-01T22:03:29  <DarkRift> be *
2011-05-01T22:03:47  <eghm> which instance do you get that error in?
2011-05-01T22:04:24  <DarkRift> let me paste the console output
2011-05-01T22:05:36  <DarkRift> http://pastie.org/1855604  that's actually what I get
2011-05-01T22:05:43  <eghm> bits been a while since i setup my grid, multiple tests get run on the server the commands get sent to all the clients, so Singletons or the like could maybe be an issue
2011-05-01T22:07:02  <eghm> the class is there?
2011-05-01T22:07:08  <DarkRift> yup
2011-05-01T22:08:36  <eghm> like i said it has been a while... can you turn up the verbosity?
2011-05-01T22:08:53  <DarkRift> how would I do that, been searching for this
2011-05-01T22:09:11  <DarkRift> I'm using the build.xml coming from the default grid
2011-05-01T22:09:32  <DarkRift> took the demo target, and added the my jar in the classpath
2011-05-01T22:09:47  <DarkRift> -my
2011-05-01T22:13:23  <DarkRift> I can paste the code I use in my build.xml, give me 2 seconds
2011-05-01T22:15:50  <DarkRift> http://pastie.org/1855619
2011-05-01T22:19:13  <eghm> your jar is in with those others?
2011-05-01T22:19:35  <DarkRift> yes, it's in the vendor folder
2011-05-01T22:20:38  <eghm> pretty much looks like how i did it, do the tests that come with grid work?
2011-05-01T22:20:44  <DarkRift> yes
2011-05-01T22:20:51  <DarkRift> that's what I find weird
2011-05-01T22:21:06  <eghm> have you commented everything out of you class?
2011-05-01T22:21:14  <DarkRift> what do you mean
2011-05-01T22:21:43  <DarkRift> first, how do I raise the level of the logger ?
2011-05-01T22:21:45  <eghm> just to see if an empty test would at least get loaded
2011-05-01T22:21:52  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-05-01T22:21:57  <eghm> ya, i forget, that... been to long
2011-05-01T22:22:32  <DarkRift> I just can't seem to find docs about it either
2011-05-01T22:27:12  *** pnitin has joined #selenium
2011-05-01T22:30:13  <DarkRift> ok I found out how to increase the log levels
2011-05-01T22:31:03  <DarkRift> in your test, do you use 			startSeleniumSession(host, port, env, webSite);
2011-05-01T22:31:07  <DarkRift> to create a new session ?
2011-05-01T22:37:53  <DarkRift> because I receive this error
2011-05-01T22:37:54  <DarkRift>      [java] Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Could not start Selenium session: ERROR: Could not retrieve a new session
2011-05-01T22:46:44  <DarkRift> found it ...
2011-05-01T22:46:51  <DarkRift> that was really stupid
2011-05-01T22:47:03  <DarkRift> the http:// was missing for the darn webSite
2011-05-01T22:48:28  <DarkRift> this should be fixed or the error should be more explicit
2011-05-01T22:54:45  <DarkRift> thanks for the hints, if I just commented out everything, it would have loaded, there was an exception in the constructor itself
2011-05-01T22:54:53  <DarkRift> thanks eghm
