2011-03-20T08:17:13  <simonstewart> g'day all
2011-03-20T08:22:57  <jarib> good day, mr. stewart
2011-03-20T08:23:16  <simonstewart> Was thinking of spending some time this afternoon hacking on crazy fun
2011-03-20T08:23:34  <simonstewart> I forget where we left it
2011-03-20T08:23:36  <jarib> cool
2011-03-20T08:24:00  <simonstewart> The hardest bit to get right for a long time was copying files
2011-03-20T08:24:16  <simonstewart> I may spend some time looking at that
2011-03-20T08:24:20  <jarib> k
2011-03-20T08:24:31  <simonstewart> Anything else that you're keen to see in there?
2011-03-20T08:24:46  <simonstewart> The alternative is lazy parsing of rules in rake
2011-03-20T08:24:57  <simonstewart> so we don't need to read _every_ build.desc file at start up
2011-03-20T08:25:07  <jarib> right
2011-03-20T08:25:14  <nirvdrum> I'd be super-pumped if the build could move right along after a test failure.
2011-03-20T08:25:30  <simonstewart> nirvdrum: the java tests?
2011-03-20T08:25:37  <simonstewart> That's pretty easy to do
2011-03-20T08:25:41  <nirvdrum> Normally FF failures on Mac for me.
2011-03-20T08:26:07  <simonstewart> we run the java tests using ant's junit task
2011-03-20T08:26:07  <simonstewart> http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/junit.html
2011-03-20T08:26:34  <jarib> simonstewart: you're thinking of the version at http://code.google.com/p/crazy-fun, i assume?
2011-03-20T08:26:39  <simonstewart> So you just need to tweak the "haltonX" settings
2011-03-20T08:26:44  <simonstewart> jarib: absolutely
2011-03-20T08:29:48  <jarib> can't remember what state it's in, just remember us messing up the repo :)
2011-03-20T08:31:16  <simonstewart> Fresh checkout
2011-03-20T08:31:41  <simonstewart> does the mktempdir command clean up after itself
2011-03-20T08:31:48  <simonstewart> I have a sneaky feeling it may not
2011-03-20T08:32:17  <simonstewart> Also, is more than one "describe" block in a file idiomatic rspec?
2011-03-20T08:33:28  <jarib> looks like it doesn't clean up, no
2011-03-20T08:34:21  <jarib> several describes are uncommon but not unheard of
2011-03-20T08:34:47  <simonstewart> Thanks.
2011-03-20T08:34:47  <jarib> it depends on the style - some people like to describe each method of a class
2011-03-20T08:35:10  <jarib> you can also use context "..." do ... end

2011-03-20T08:35:30  <simonstewart> groovy
2011-03-20T08:35:41  <simonstewart> I'll use a single top-level describe

2011-03-20T08:45:32  <jarib> simonstewart: could also consider using cucumber + aruba for end-to-end testing - https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/aruba
2011-03-20T08:45:43  <jarib> nice set of cucumber steps to test CLI programs.
2011-03-20T08:45:43  <simonstewart> At some point
2011-03-20T08:45:47  <simonstewart> Ohhh...
2011-03-20T08:45:56  * simonstewart remains focused for now
2011-03-20T08:46:00  <simonstewart> Shiny
2011-03-20T08:46:55  <jarib> it's pretty nice
2011-03-20T08:47:57  <simonstewart> Might ping aslak about cuke up this week
2011-03-20T08:49:15  <simonstewart> Hmmm... how do these specs pass
2011-03-20T08:49:30  <simonstewart> CrazyFun should puke if it sees a task it doesn't recognise
2011-03-20T08:49:39  <simonstewart> Yet we use "example" with impunity
2011-03-20T08:50:04  * simonstewart shrugs
2011-03-20T08:50:11  <simonstewart> Will continue using "example" as the target type
2011-03-20T08:50:45  <jarib> heh
2011-03-20T08:51:05  <jarib> state leaking betwen the specs maybe?
2011-03-20T08:51:40  <simonstewart> I just think we haven't hooked up the raising an build error yet
2011-03-20T08:54:06  <simonstewart> The parsing_build_spec doesn't have the behaviour tested
2011-03-20T08:55:07  <jarib> because it's not a behaviour of the parser
2011-03-20T08:55:12  <simonstewart> Right
2011-03-20T08:55:15  <jarib> it just parses - doesn't care about mappings
2011-03-20T08:55:28  <jarib> or?
2011-03-20T08:55:31  <simonstewart> I'm thinking of making the file copying behaviour a mixin
2011-03-20T08:55:58  <jarib> hmm
2011-03-20T08:55:58  <jarib>               raise "Unable to handle type: #{target.name}"
2011-03-20T08:56:06  <simonstewart> eep
2011-03-20T08:56:13  <jarib> looks like it should raise
2011-03-20T08:57:07  <jarib> well, specs look right
2011-03-20T08:57:30  <jarib> i don't see anywhere we're using "example" where it should in fact raise
2011-03-20T08:58:03  <simonstewart> "should parse a simple file" in parsing_builds_spec
2011-03-20T08:58:14  <simonstewart> Hmm... though that _is_ just parsing
2011-03-20T08:58:23  <jarib> right
2011-03-20T08:58:30  * simonstewart shrugs and goes back to files
2011-03-20T08:58:35  <jarib> :)
2011-03-20T08:59:12  <simonstewart> What's the "right way" of testing Modules
2011-03-20T08:59:23  <simonstewart> Create a class that includes the module and just test that?
2011-03-20T08:59:44  <simonstewart> Because i don't really want a chunk of class methods
2011-03-20T09:00:02  <simonstewart> google testing modules in rspec
2011-03-20T09:00:03  <selbot`> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1542945/testing-modules-in-rspec
2011-03-20T09:00:05  <jarib> o = Object.new; o.extend(TheMOdule)
2011-03-20T09:00:09  <jarib> is what I do
2011-03-20T09:00:34  <simonstewart> looks like the common pattern
2011-03-20T09:01:21  <jarib> shared examples like mentioned in the link would run those specs against every includer, which may fit as well
2011-03-20T09:01:40  <jarib> depends on how much your module depends on the includer's state i guess
2011-03-20T09:01:52  <simonstewart> I'd like it to be reasonably stateless
2011-03-20T09:02:09  <simonstewart> It'd just be nice if tasks could go "get_deps"
2011-03-20T09:02:12  <simonstewart> Or some such
2011-03-20T09:02:25  <jarib> right

2011-03-20T12:33:47  <jarib> :)
2011-03-20T12:33:53  <simonstewart> Is there a handy way to convert a method into a block?
2011-03-20T12:34:00  <simonstewart> I'd really like to call "task.enhance
2011-03-20T12:34:05  <simonstewart> and pass a reference to a method
2011-03-20T12:34:15  <simonstewart> Hang on, we've done that elsewhere

2011-03-20T12:37:54  <jarib> great
2011-03-20T12:38:51  <simonstewart> I can check in a failing test if you'd like a peek
2011-03-20T12:39:18  <jarib> go for it
2011-03-20T12:39:43  <simonstewart> Pushed
2011-03-20T12:39:59  <simonstewart> Take a look at "library_task.rb" for the skeleton
2011-03-20T12:40:23  <jarib> ok
2011-03-20T12:43:49  <jarib> simonstewart: task.rb:31-32 is a bit useless
2011-03-20T12:44:07  <jarib> that's not the same ivar
2011-03-20T12:44:13  <simonstewart> interesting
2011-03-20T12:44:28  <simonstewart> And not quite what I expected
2011-03-20T12:44:37  <jarib> since you're in the class body, you're referencing a class instance variable
2011-03-20T12:44:48  <jarib> i.e. an ivar on the instance of Class that is CrazyFun::Task
2011-03-20T12:45:27  <simonstewart> And we should be referring to the CrazyFun::Java::LibraryTask.extension
2011-03-20T12:46:43  <jarib> i.e. a private getter for @extension, yes?
2011-03-20T12:47:08  <jarib> not really needed if it's just an ivar
2011-03-20T12:47:49  <simonstewart> The idea is that each of the crazy fun task types may have their own extensions
2011-03-20T12:47:56  <jarib> yep
2011-03-20T12:48:06  <simonstewart> ".jar" for a java library, "-srcs.jar" for a source jar, and so on
2011-03-20T12:48:28  <simonstewart> So we could do a "name += @extension if @extension"
2011-03-20T12:48:31  <simonstewart> k
2011-03-20T12:49:35  <simonstewart> I suspect we'll be able to clean things up a bit
2011-03-20T12:49:45  <simonstewart> This use of "enhance" doesn't feel quite right
2011-03-20T12:50:55  <jarib> ah, it's on Rake::Task
2011-03-20T12:51:19  <simonstewart> Right
2011-03-20T12:53:03  <jarib> enhance seems sane, what doesn't feel right about it?
2011-03-20T12:54:08  <simonstewart> I think it's just the string of "enhance" calls in the initializer
2011-03-20T12:54:12  *** ian_mac2 has joined #selenium
2011-03-20T12:54:47  <simonstewart> The alternative is what we're doing in the "java.rb" file
2011-03-20T12:55:11  <simonstewart> I think I quite like this alternaitve
2011-03-20T12:55:36  <jarib> hmm
2011-03-20T12:56:29  <simonstewart> indeed
2011-03-20T12:56:36  <simonstewart> decisions decisions
2011-03-20T12:57:55  <simonstewart> Right. The Wife is back
2011-03-20T12:57:57  <jarib> i don't really get why we're passing these procs/methods around - shouldn't a JavaLibrary instance just know what to do?
2011-03-20T12:58:04  <simonstewart> Right
2011-03-20T12:58:04  <jarib> Java::Library
2011-03-20T12:58:27  <simonstewart> But it'd be nice if it fits into the mental model of Rake
2011-03-20T12:58:55  <jarib> mhm
2011-03-20T12:59:58  <simonstewart> Signing off
2011-03-20T13:00:02  <simonstewart> G'night all!

2011-03-20T16:24:20  <ken_wienecke> Question: Once the Selenium IDE stops on an "assert..." command, is there a way to restart execution at the next instruction without having to manually use the "Set / Clear Start Point" menu item?
