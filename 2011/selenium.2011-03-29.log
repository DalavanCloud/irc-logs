I've also found that he goes back and finds his mentions, so even if I forget to ask when he is around, he'll ask me why I was looking for him. :) I can always talk to him next week at the conference too

2011-03-29T12:01:00  <andytinkham> I think you may have been thinking that the encoding should be handled entirely internally rather than expecting it to already be UTF-8. Not a big deal to me at the moment though, was more just checking
2011-03-29T12:02:02  <selbot2> james.h.evans.jr half a minute ago - JimEvans: Refactoring the profile handling in the .NET Firefox driver, preparing to enable JSON serialization. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11831
2011-03-29T12:02:20  <jarib> i could call .encode("UTF-8"), you'd still get an error if you have a binary string with non-ASCII bytes (which was your case IIRC)
2011-03-29T12:03:20  <jarib> but in that case it would work as long as the string sent to send_keys is tagged with the correct encoding (be it UTF-8 or not)

2011-03-29T12:06:55  <jimevans> olleolleolle: you're probably better off asking adamgoucher that question, and i don't see him around at the moment.

2011-03-29T18:37:29  <antlong> you might have to, i found a pretty nasty bug just now
2011-03-29T18:38:05  <simonstewart> go on
2011-03-29T18:38:14  * simonstewart assumes the Face Of Dread
2011-03-29T18:38:59  <antlong> well the sympthom of the bug implies that properties are cached
2011-03-29T18:40:22  <simonstewart> That doesn't sound good
2011-03-29T18:47:29  <antlong> simonstewart, i have a test case you can run, if you want to take a look
2011-03-29T18:47:46  <simonstewart> Can you mail it to me?
2011-03-29T18:47:50  <antlong> theres seemingly 2 issues, might be seperate, one when the property value is cached, one when nothing is returned
2011-03-29T18:47:52  <antlong> sure thing
2011-03-29T18:48:08  <simonstewart> Ugh. I hate it when things like that happen
2011-03-29T18:49:46  <simonstewart> Well crap
2011-03-29T18:49:58  <simonstewart> I've not switched my build environment over properly
2011-03-29T18:50:06  <simonstewart> Using the old version of selenium, not the new one
2011-03-29T18:50:20  <simonstewart> On the plus side, I know that a metric tonne of tests look good
2011-03-29T18:52:20  <antlong> hmn
2011-03-29T18:53:31  <antlong> goBack() does that just execute javascript's -1 history functionality
2011-03-29T18:53:58  <simonstewart> There's a more sophisticated version landing in the atoms soon
2011-03-29T18:54:20  <simonstewart> That handles things like frames and other browsers better
2011-03-29T18:56:56  <antlong> is that how is works now?

2011-03-29T19:00:03  <antlong> yeah, im hesitating putting too much time in this one, i do think it might be cross browser though
2011-03-29T19:00:04  <simonstewart> It should definitely be out before seconf
2011-03-29T19:00:21  <simonstewart> If it's cross browser that's different :)
