2011-04-20T02:44:53  <Ivog> U can see it when you click on more info on the stats on the right
2011-04-20T02:46:53  <AutomatedTester> Ivog: they have changed it

2011-04-20T02:48:58  <Ivog> Hm ok, well right now it looks like we're pretty close
2011-04-20T02:49:11  <AutomatedTester> well keep up the work

2011-04-20T02:52:01  <Ivog> Well im trying to figure out some bug with setting a ff profile on a remotewebdriver
2011-04-20T02:52:31  <Ivog> Issue 1555

2011-04-20T02:54:23  <AutomatedTester> #1555
2011-04-20T02:54:24  <selbot2>  open/new Setting firefox_profile capabililty with dotnet on remotewebdriver doesn't make rc start correct profile - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1555
2011-04-20T02:54:41  <Ivog> Its some weird serialization problem where some preferences seem to end up in ff and some not havent figured it out yet
2011-04-20T02:55:19  <mashiara> python unittest gurus: what would be the best way to have a method to be called on any test failure ? (I wish to capture a screenshot and dump the full page source in such case)
2011-04-20T02:55:43  <AutomatedTester> mashiara: does it need to be unittest?
2011-04-20T02:56:31  <mashiara> preferably yes, otherwise I need to reinvent the wheel for the parts unittest provides. unless of course you can recommend a framework
2011-04-20T02:57:38  <AutomatedTester> hmmm have you had a look to see if you can access the test state in the tearDown?
2011-04-20T02:57:56  <AutomatedTester> i use py.test and that has hooks all over the place for me to extend
2011-04-20T02:58:07  <AutomatedTester> but lets have a look at unittest
2011-04-20T02:59:48  <AutomatedTester> mashiara: http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.run
2011-04-20T02:59:52  *** |izzie has quit IRC
2011-04-20T03:00:07  <AutomatedTester> looks like if you play with the run method you can get its result
2011-04-20T03:00:12  <AutomatedTester> thats from a quick google
2011-04-20T03:00:48  <mashiara> yep, I was actually reading the source and trying to follow the program flow
2011-04-20T03:01:01  <AutomatedTester> http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.defaultTestResult
2011-04-20T03:01:55  <mashiara> and probably messing about with the results is the way to go
2011-04-20T03:05:07  <adamgoucher> http://blog.projectdirigible.com/?p=482 is another possibility
2011-04-20T03:05:38  <adamgoucher> (and would be a neat thing to include in the bindings themselves
2011-04-20T03:05:39  <adamgoucher> )
2011-04-20T03:06:47  <mashiara> decorator is indeed a good idea
2011-04-20T03:10:13  * mashiara wonders why he didn't 1) think about it himself 2) find that post with google
2011-04-20T03:11:34  * adamgoucher knew what he was looking for
2011-04-20T03:14:07  <adamgoucher> however, there is value in writing your own runner -- and its on the far geek side of fun
2011-04-20T03:19:24  * AutomatedTester doesnt like that approach because it means you have to remember to apply that design to all tests
2011-04-20T03:19:49  <mashiara> I agree
2011-04-20T03:19:53  <adamgoucher> only ones that need it
2011-04-20T03:20:05  <AutomatedTester> this is why I like py.test, in that I can monkeypatch the runners setup and teardown
2011-04-20T03:20:29  <adamgoucher> phpunit is actually nice in this regard. there are hooks all over the place
2011-04-20T03:21:02  <AutomatedTester> i also like py.test since it does the test discovery
2011-04-20T03:21:08  <adamgoucher> ...of course, when the author changes a billion properties from protected to private one's cleverly built framework might throw a hissy fit
2011-04-20T03:22:09  <AutomatedTester> what value do you get from moving from protected to private?
2011-04-20T03:22:22  <AutomatedTester> other than closing the framework down
2011-04-20T03:24:30  <adamgoucher> https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/115 -- people were duplicating 'internal' property names. so he made it that it didnt matter
2011-04-20T03:25:17  <adamgoucher> it was easily worked around, but still a pain. of course, i learned even more about places you can override things :)
2011-04-20T03:25:33  <AutomatedTester> omg...
2011-04-20T03:25:46  <AutomatedTester> this is why PHP is crap
2011-04-20T03:26:28  <AutomatedTester> and seriously if people notice that a variable is used then they shouldnt raise bugs
2011-04-20T03:26:40  * AutomatedTester gets off his soap box
2011-04-20T03:28:21  <adamgoucher> heh. i'm sure the bugs that get raised in [other language] are just as bad were one to read them
2011-04-20T03:28:34  <AutomatedTester> true
2011-04-20T03:28:46  * AutomatedTester looks at Selenium bugs...
2011-04-20T03:29:03  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: since you are a travelling Salesman for Selenium
2011-04-20T03:29:17  <AutomatedTester> have you come across people wanting to use Python 2.5 with Selenium?
2011-04-20T03:29:54  <adamgoucher> nope. even jython/ironpython are at 2.7 i think now
2011-04-20T03:30:05  <AutomatedTester> awesome
2011-04-20T03:30:12  <adamgoucher> i would drop 2.5
2011-04-20T03:30:14  <AutomatedTester> I am going to tell a user to upgrade python version
2011-04-20T03:30:26  <AutomatedTester> i wasnt planning on support it
2011-04-20T03:30:30  <AutomatedTester> supporting even
2011-04-20T03:30:45  <AutomatedTester> btw, did you solve your subprocess starting RC issue?
2011-04-20T03:31:23  <adamgoucher> nope. i suspect its actually a how-jenkins-starts-an-agent problem
2011-04-20T03:31:43  <AutomatedTester> the python tests in Selenium start the RC cleanly
2011-04-20T03:31:55  <AutomatedTester> and tear it down
2011-04-20T03:32:02  <adamgoucher> if not SeleniumServer.have_server():
2011-04-20T03:32:03  <adamgoucher>     if 'HUDSON_HOME' in os.environ or 'JENKINS_HOME' in os.environ:
2011-04-20T03:32:03  <adamgoucher>         sys.exit("The Selenium Server must be started outside of the Hudson/Jenkins Agent")
2011-04-20T03:32:03  <adamgoucher>     SeleniumServer.start_server()
2011-04-20T03:34:23  <adamgoucher> if the script is run outside of a jenkins remote job, then everything works. but as soon as you run it via one it will hang trying to launch a browser. there is some timeout somewhere that is not firing but cant be bothered to investigate
2011-04-20T03:35:19  <adamgoucher> if, on the remote machine, you stop the se server and start it again then the browser opens as if nothing was ever amiss

2011-04-20T03:46:22  <AutomatedTester> Selenium RC allows you to use your favourite language to write tests

2011-04-20T06:24:52  *** Ivog has joined #selenium
2011-04-20T06:34:43  <grigouze> I got a question about selenium and custom profile
2011-04-20T06:35:43  <grigouze> I make a custom firefox profile with some values in prefs.js, but when I started the selenium server it adds some values that I don't want
2011-04-20T06:35:59  <grigouze> i.e: user_pref("network.proxy.type", 1);
2011-04-20T06:36:18  <grigouze> ans just after the server add in prefs.js : user_pref("network.proxy.type", 2);
2011-04-20T06:36:33  <grigouze> is there a way to skip this ?
2011-04-20T06:38:05  <grigouze> anyone ?
2011-04-20T06:39:57  <AutomatedTester> grigouze: Se1 or Se2?
2011-04-20T06:40:54  <grigouze> Se2
2011-04-20T06:41:50  <AutomatedTester> so are you doing profile.set_preference("network.proxy.type",2);

2011-04-20T06:53:15  <grigouze> AutomatedTester: but is says version 2.0b3 ?
2011-04-20T06:53:24  <grigouze> it
2011-04-20T06:54:17  <AutomatedTester> grigouze: the reason why I think its changing it, is because Selenium needs to proxy its stuff
2011-04-20T06:55:33  <grigouze> without profile it's ok for connetion but just after it's https with self signed cert, so there is a problem
2011-04-20T06:55:42  <grigouze> that's why i make a custom profile
2011-04-20T06:56:06  <AutomatedTester> can you get a proper cert?
2011-04-20T06:56:26  <grigouze> actually no :(
2011-04-20T06:56:40  <grigouze> but maybe it will work :)
2011-04-20T06:57:03  <AutomatedTester> getting Selenium to work with Self signed certs is quite painful
2011-04-20T06:57:16  <AutomatedTester> I always recommend people spend $12 and get a real cert

2011-04-20T09:42:30  <miker2> antlong: haven't confirmed that yet.  Testing alerts with iframes in IE right now.  There's a simple page/script attached to the bug that I'll try soon.
2011-04-20T09:43:03  <antlong> miker2 is it a javascript alert?
2011-04-20T09:43:13  <antlong> adamgoucher im not in testing anymore either
2011-04-20T09:44:07  <miker2> It's a javascript confirm() dialog.

2011-04-20T09:47:28  <AutomatedTester> but when it comes to release it 3 versions that need testing
2011-04-20T09:47:40  <antlong> adamgoucher the place that just turned down a 200 mil offer from google >.<
2011-04-20T09:47:57  <AutomatedTester> soon I want to support Python 3
2011-04-20T09:48:03  <AutomatedTester> so that makes it 4
2011-04-20T09:48:18  <antlong> AutomatedTester you can use a prefix when you run the test in shell, or you can use the platform/version option in pytest
2011-04-20T09:48:19  <AutomatedTester> so 1 fix needs 12 rounds of testing
2011-04-20T09:49:01  <adamgoucher> the offer price is irrelevant if you dont have equity

2011-04-20T10:50:00  <lawcab> any one has a solution?
2011-04-20T10:51:15  <ivog> jimevans: hmm it looks like serialisation is working now but when i'm still not able to set the browser.download.dir pref, I suspect it's got something to do with browser.download.folderList pref being an int... also firefox opens two tabs now.. which i guess has something to do with something being wrong in the profile?
2011-04-20T10:51:32  <ivog> when i'm = i'm
2011-04-20T10:52:34  <jimevans> ivog: so what happens when you try to run locally? in other words, don't use grid, don't use remote. use the profile locally.
2011-04-20T10:52:48  <ivog> that works
2011-04-20T10:53:21  <ivog> i'll have to compare the generated firefoxprofiles
2011-04-20T10:53:23  <jimevans> alright, what about when you use an instance of RemoteWebDriver on the same machine.
2011-04-20T10:53:35  <ivog> that's how i'm testing it
2011-04-20T10:53:43  <ivog> i've not tested this with a remote remotewebdriver yet
2011-04-20T10:53:51  <jimevans> okay.
2011-04-20T10:54:22  <ivog> and grid's not in the mix right now, just straight to a RemoteWebdriver
2011-04-20T10:54:45  <jimevans> i don't know why i thought you were using grid, but i did.
2011-04-20T10:56:54  <ivog> yea i was bussy trying to get grid to work a couple of days ago, but I talked to francois about the profile problem and he said it couldn't have anything to do with grid which makes sense because grid just passes requests on to RC's
2011-04-20T10:58:21  <ivog> so i test directly to an RC. I also tested with java which at first I thought also didn't work but I just forgot to set  the browser.download.folderList pref as well, it should be set along with browser.download.dir to get the download.dir set correctly
2011-04-20T10:58:37  <ivog> when doing that in java it starts working
2011-04-20T10:58:42  <xirkus> any documentation available for the new grid implementation in WebDriver 2?
2011-04-20T10:59:20  <ivog> somehow in .Net I can see that the browser.download.dir is set in about:config but not the browser.download.folderList pref
2011-04-20T10:59:48  *** toseter has quit IRC
2011-04-20T11:00:18  <ivog> the difference could be that one is a string and the other is an int, but that also doesn't seem to be the case because when i set a third string pref that one also doesn't end up in the about:config screen
2011-04-20T11:00:21  <jimevans> it gets set properly when you run locally?
2011-04-20T11:00:29  <ivog> yes
2011-04-20T11:01:03  <ivog> so i thought it could be a bug in profile.ToBase64String() ?
2011-04-20T11:01:44  <jimevans> It's possible, but I highly doubt it.
2011-04-20T11:01:55  *** foolfoolz has joined #selenium
2011-04-20T11:02:31  <jimevans> ToBase64String() writes the profile to the temp directory, creates an in-memory .zip file of it, and converts the memory blob to base64.
2011-04-20T11:02:50  <ivog> i guess i could compare the generated profiles when using FirefoxDriver vs RemoteWebdriver
2011-04-20T11:03:01  <jimevans> i'll allow that it may be in the writing the profile to disk, but then it shouldn't work with the local firefox driver either.
2011-04-20T11:03:16  <jimevans> that's what i thought you were doing.
2011-04-20T11:04:47  <jimevans> can you gist me a code listing of your profile manipulation?
2011-04-20T11:05:33  <ivog>                             var profile = new FirefoxProfile();
2011-04-20T11:05:33  <ivog>                             profile.EnableNativeEvents = false;
2011-04-20T11:05:34  <ivog>                             if (Configuration.UseGrid)
2011-04-20T11:05:34  <ivog>                             {
2011-04-20T11:05:35  <ivog>                                 desiredCapabilities.SetCapability("firefox_profile", profile.ToBase64String());
2011-04-20T11:05:35  <ivog>                                 webDriver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri(Configuration.GridHubUrl), desiredCapabilities);
2011-04-20T11:05:39  <ivog> ah sorry that doesn't work...

2011-04-20T11:29:17  <jimevans> well ivog is gone, but i figured out why it seems broken.
2011-04-20T11:49:27  <AutomatedTester> why jimevans
2011-04-20T11:50:08  <jimevans> because writing the preferences to disk doesn't create a fully-realized profile. you've got to run firefox.exe with the -silent switch to initialize the profile.
2011-04-20T11:50:53  <jimevans> and it looks like the firefox driver when called from the remote server is expecting the fully-realized profile.
2011-04-20T11:51:27  <AutomatedTester> thats a bug in remote then
2011-04-20T11:51:38  <jimevans> i'm thinking so.
2011-04-20T11:51:55  <AutomatedTester> because remote should act like close binding
2011-04-20T11:52:08  <AutomatedTester> To the Issue tracker!!!

2011-04-20T12:49:21  <jleyba> with eran and simon on vacation, it'd probably be me
2011-04-20T12:50:08  <jimevans> it's not critical. i'm just trying to work out #1579

2011-04-20T12:51:01  <jimevans> I thought I was sending the right stuff over the wire from the .NET bindings, but I'm getting the behaviour described in the issue.
2011-04-20T12:54:11  <jleyba> The entire profile is sent across as a base64 string
2011-04-20T12:54:19  <jleyba> See FirefoxProfile#toJson()
2011-04-20T12:54:37  <jimevans> yeah, I'm doing that.
2011-04-20T12:54:52  <jimevans> or i thought i was.
2011-04-20T13:00:27  <jimevans> never mind. i'll ask simon about it when he gets back.
