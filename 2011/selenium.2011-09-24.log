2011-09-24T14:33:31  <{aaron}> we are running into problems testing a highly (purely) javascript based UI with selenium...are there known best practices for ensuring selenium sees dynamically rendered content? (for instance, when I view-source, the content is not there but it's clearly displayed in the browser)
