2011-07-31T11:07:03  <Sublime12> Hello
2011-07-31T11:07:09  <Ajay> hi
2011-07-31T11:07:27  <Sublime12> I have a quick and easy question, fairly new to selenium but i'm getting stuck at the first hurdle
2011-07-31T11:07:36  <Sublime12> I'm trying to stop the browser from timing out
2011-07-31T11:07:54  <Sublime12> i've tried a 'set timeout' but that didn't work, and also a 'click and wait' but that crashed too
2011-07-31T11:08:03  <Sublime12> any idea what i'm doing wrong?
2011-07-31T11:08:12  <Ajay> Are you using selenium RC or webdriver ?
2011-07-31T11:08:34  <Sublime12> webdriver
2011-07-31T11:09:51  <Sublime12> I run open and settimeout to 99999999 as the first command, however when a click and wait for command is called it times out after 30 seconds
2011-07-31T11:10:07  <Sublime12> i've tried a 'waitforpagetoload' but don't think i'm doing that right either
2011-07-31T11:10:37  <Ajay> i think you are using selenium api's
2011-07-31T11:11:50  <Sublime12> http://pastebin.com/mEJkaYqc
2011-07-31T11:12:01  <Sublime12> that's what i'm getting, any ideas?
2011-07-31T11:12:31  <Siph0n> Sublime12, there are implicitWaits you can try.
2011-07-31T11:13:18  <Sublime12> I don't want it for this one command, the test is literally this one sequence
2011-07-31T11:13:28  <Sublime12> i.e. upload file > verify that text if present
2011-07-31T11:13:38  <Sublime12> however it times out before the file is uploaded
2011-07-31T11:13:39  <Siph0n> which language are you using?
2011-07-31T11:14:04  <Sublime12> I'm just using selenium ide 1.1.0
2011-07-31T11:14:25  <Siph0n> oh, sorry,... dont know then.
2011-07-31T11:15:02  <Sublime12> http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-core/1.0/reference.html
2011-07-31T11:15:24  <Sublime12> the settimeout section is what i'm following, but it's not working for some reasom
2011-07-31T11:15:27  <Sublime12> n*
2011-07-31T11:15:28  <Ajay> try  waitForVisible  in the element in the page after you submit
2011-07-31T11:17:00  <Sublime12> but won't it timeout after 30 seconds also (as it won't be visible at the time)
2011-07-31T11:17:28  <Ajay> http://seleniumhq.org/docs/02_selenium_ide.html#the-andwait-commands
2011-07-31T11:17:32  <Sublime12> what i'm trying to do is upload a file larger than the size permitted, and i want ti to verify the 'over the limit' text is there
2011-07-31T11:18:03  <Sublime12> I figure this is depdent on upload speeds, so if i can have it not time out for 10 minutes (or so) it should be enough for the test purposes
2011-07-31T11:18:08  <Sublime12> and then resume and look for thew text
2011-07-31T11:18:22  <Sublime12> otherwise it should just carry on
2011-07-31T11:20:49  *** sromanov has joined #selenium
2011-07-31T11:21:17  <Ajay> try AndWait
2011-07-31T11:21:30  <Ajay> i am not sure about sel ide
2011-07-31T11:21:47  <Ajay> i use webdriver
2011-07-31T11:21:53  *** Briareos1 has quit IRC
2011-07-31T11:22:54  <Sublime12> Theres: clickAndWait  name=submit_csv
2011-07-31T11:23:07  <Sublime12> but it times out after 30seconds(the default)
2011-07-31T11:32:08  <Ajay> waitForPageToLoad
2011-07-31T11:32:11  <Ajay> use this
2011-07-31T11:32:24  <Ajay> i read the documentation now
2011-07-31T11:32:51  <Sublime12> I put that where? after / before the 'click and wait' ?
2011-07-31T11:32:53  <Ajay> setTimeOut is valid for open and waitFor*  Commads
2011-07-31T11:33:12  <Ajay> After ClickAndWait
2011-07-31T11:33:44  <Ajay> Let me if it works :)
2011-07-31T11:36:01  <Sublime12> think it did
2011-07-31T11:36:05  <Sublime12> i'm sure I tried that
2011-07-31T11:36:07  <Sublime12> but oh well :)
2011-07-31T11:36:16  <Sublime12> running test again to double check
2011-07-31T11:36:31  <Sublime12> forgot to delete the other tests so it re-loaded it before i could verify properly
2011-07-31T11:37:41  <Sublime12> yea it works
2011-07-31T11:37:45  <Sublime12> it's on a seperate line
2011-07-31T11:37:49  <Sublime12> can I condense them into one
2011-07-31T11:38:00  <Sublime12> i.e. clickAndwaitForPageToLoad
2011-07-31T11:39:06  <Sublime12> guess not.....
2011-07-31T11:39:09  <Sublime12> [error] Unknown command: 'clickAndwaitForPageToLoad' :)
2011-07-31T11:40:29  <Ajay> waitForPageToLoad is a single command
2011-07-31T11:40:55  <Sublime12> yea, is there not a way to set a default timeout for the whole script though
2011-07-31T11:41:16  <Sublime12> instead of calling this command every time you need to wait +30 seconds (more for future reference)
2011-07-31T11:42:40  <Ajay> waitForPageToLoad waits xxx seconds until the new page is loaded
2011-07-31T11:42:59  <Ajay> i am not an IDE expert i need to go through the docs
2011-07-31T11:43:16  <Sublime12> yea, say (for example) if I have to wiat +30 seconds several times in each test, do i need to call this command for each instance
2011-07-31T11:43:29  <Sublime12> or is there not an easy way to change it permanently
2011-07-31T11:43:45  <Sublime12> I settimeout
2011-07-31T11:44:02  <Sublime12> and it recognises it as a correct command, but it still timesout at 30seconds
2011-07-31T11:47:56  <Ajay> In the  IDE -> Options -> Options
2011-07-31T11:48:02  <Ajay> you can se the timeout there
2011-07-31T11:49:06  <Sublime12> yea I noticed that, but if i'm sending the test case across computers / networks, it's probably not feasible to make sure this has been changed, so i would like to set a command in the test to make sure of this also
2011-07-31T11:49:35  <Ajay> how are yiu running your test case ?

2011-07-31T12:59:35  <Siph0n> I think there is a findElements function you can use? I havent used it before though.
2011-07-31T13:00:30  <Rotham_> sromanov:  for the pythonversion there is find_elements_by_tag_name
2011-07-31T13:00:37  <Rotham_> i suspect there is something similar in other versions
2011-07-31T13:01:57  <sromanov> Rotham_: yes, but it just gives a list for a given tag type. i was just thinking about more general type of find elements
2011-07-31T13:02:10  <sromanov> thanks, anyway

2011-07-31T13:18:28  <Sublime12> gah got another problem now
2011-07-31T13:20:31  <Sublime12> when I run the commands it seems as though selanium is going too fast for the website i'm testing. When i click the coommands manually it works, however when i run the test it bugs out
2011-07-31T13:20:37  <Sublime12> any idea how to 'slow' it down?
2011-07-31T13:20:47  <Sublime12> i tried a 'pause' but that didn't work
2011-07-31T13:21:00  <Siph0n> there is a getspeed/setspeed
2011-07-31T13:21:04  <Siph0n> function
2011-07-31T13:21:26  <Siph0n> cant find it right now tho lol
2011-07-31T13:22:23  <Sublime12> it's setspeed
2011-07-31T13:22:34  <Sublime12> will this be for the whole script or just that one command?
2011-07-31T13:23:08  <Sublime12> nvm, that didn't work either :/
2011-07-31T13:23:11  <Siph0n> for the whole script
2011-07-31T13:23:20  <Siph0n> why not?
2011-07-31T13:23:40  <Siph0n> Set execution speed (i.e., set the millisecond length of a delay which will follow each selenium operation). By default, there is no such delay, i.e., the delay is 0 milliseconds.
2011-07-31T13:23:42  <Sublime12> it just runs at fullspeed still
2011-07-31T13:24:08  <Siph0n> you are using the ide, right? I don't use the IDE, so not sure if these will work there
2011-07-31T13:24:28  *** sromanov has quit IRC
2011-07-31T13:24:34  <Sublime12> the command is in ide
2011-07-31T13:24:41  <Sublime12> but it doesn't seem to work :/
2011-07-31T13:24:53  <Siph0n> oh wow.... thats weird.... worked fine for me in ruby
2011-07-31T13:24:58  <Sublime12> i tried setspeedandwait also
2011-07-31T13:25:20  <Siph0n> have u tried using Ruby or another language instead of the ide?
2011-07-31T13:25:25  <Sublime12> no
2011-07-31T13:27:31  <Siph0n> try it? I didnt know Ruby at all, and it wasnt that difficult to get working.
2011-07-31T13:27:48  <Siph0n> especially since the ide doesnt seem to be working at all for you.
