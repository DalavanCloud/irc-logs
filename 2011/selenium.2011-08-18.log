2011-08-18T05:00:15  <eranm> I am tempted to mark this as invalid, since sites like 'www.google.com' can be accessed using both http and https, not specifying the scheme would lead to ambiguous results

2011-08-18T05:05:06  <Binken_> Why not in the middle of the window?
2011-08-18T05:06:08  <eranm> bracki, yes - if you're in an extension. See an example in  javascript/firefox-driver/js/logging.js.
2011-08-18T05:06:36  <eranm> Binken_, that's just what scrollIntoView does.
2011-08-18T05:07:13  <eranm> Binken_, if you'd like to scroll less, I'm about to land a change that allows moving the mouse by an offset that's greater than the size of the viewport - and the page will be scrolled to match
2011-08-18T05:07:43  <Binken_> I think if scroll that much will cause issues
2011-08-18T05:08:00  <eranm> ?

2011-08-18T05:09:57  <eranm> Binken_, let me get this right: there's another element covering the element you're trying to click?

2011-08-18T05:10:36  <Binken_> It automatic scroll to the top
2011-08-18T05:10:50  <bracki> eranm: I mean the other way round, have my webdriver based tests dump the contents of firefox's error console for better test debugability
2011-08-18T05:11:26  <eranm> You have a div that persists on the top of the page, then? so a user, if scrolling too much, will not be able to click the element as well?

2011-08-18T05:12:17  <eranm> Binken_, what would a user with a *very* small screen would do?
2011-08-18T05:13:14  <Binken_> very small?
2011-08-18T05:13:52  <eranm> This problem looks very specific to your case - what you could do is use executeJavascript() to scroll a bit. In the general case there's no special benefit in scrolling the element until it's in the middle of the screen - there could equally be other pages with persistent elements in the middle, or bottom.
2011-08-18T05:14:10  <eranm> And with the interactions API you would (soon) be able to control the mouse better and scrolling will be fine-grained.
2011-08-18T05:14:45  <Binken_> Yes, for now , I am using the javascript to scroll a bit
2011-08-18T05:14:51  <eranm> I meant, a screen forcing the browser window to be so small that the persistent element covers the entire viewport (or almost all of it) - think about a mobile phone in landscape mode.

2011-08-18T05:18:21  <eranm> I always feel a bit evil when I do it, but this issue should be marked 'working as intended' - the click is sent to the right coordinates, if there is another element hiding the one you want to click at, it's the same problem your user would encounter.
2011-08-18T05:19:40  <Binken_> Yeah, you are right somehow, But the user normally type the username and password without scrolling the page
2011-08-18T05:20:08  <Binken_> since the username textbox and password textbox already presented
2011-08-18T05:21:47  <jarib> krosenvold: yeah, having a single runnable file with both markup and code is pretty nice :)
2011-08-18T05:21:54  <eranm> Binken_, the documentation of scrollIntoView says that the element may not be completely scrolled to the top, depending on layout of other elements. Perhaps you can style the page differently so the element will remain below this sticky div

2011-08-18T05:24:05  <urbanfbi> eranm: I do this on my local mashine. firefox get opened, but no url seems to be requested
2011-08-18T05:24:21  <Binken_> Eranm, Where I can find the native event implents for firefox?
2011-08-18T05:24:28  <Binken_> the source code
2011-08-18T05:24:44  <Binken_> like sendkeys(Keys.Tab)

2011-08-18T05:25:22  <Binken_> Does thi same as the IE?
2011-08-18T05:25:26  <eranm> yes
2011-08-18T05:25:41  <eranm> the native events code is shared between Firefox and IE (it's platform-dependent though)
2011-08-18T05:26:14  <Binken_> so the what's difference for the sendkeys method in IE an firefox
2011-08-18T05:29:54  <eranm> On Windows, there's no difference. On Linux, native events are turned off by default so it uses synthetic events. If you turn on native events, you'll get a behaviour that's similar to the Windows one, but may not be exactly the same - since there are slight differences in timing when native events are sent on Windows vs. Linux
2011-08-18T05:30:38  <Binken_> So it's strange that sendkeys(keys.tab) works on IE not firefox
2011-08-18T05:33:07  <eranm> There could be several reasons, but the first I'd check is focus issues - if the Firefox window has focus, does it treat tabs differently?
2011-08-18T05:35:50  <Binken_> I think it's same

2011-08-18T07:17:15  <Guest8055666> Hi, I'm new to Selenium, trying to get it working in a web project. I created a quick test that runs on google.com, however when I try to run it, I get a FileNotFound exception for Newtonsoft.Json Assembly. The assembly is referenced in my project, and lives in the same directory as WebDriver.dll. What else do I need to do to have WebDriver.dll see that assembly?

2011-08-18T07:20:18  *** mstockton has joined #selenium
2011-08-18T07:20:30  <eranm> AutomatedTester, I was hoping that elementFromPoint will return the body if it gets the coordinates of the middle of an overflowing element. It doesn't - it returns the original link element.
2011-08-18T07:21:04  <AutomatedTester> so we will go with my approach then?
2011-08-18T07:21:18  <AutomatedTester> eranm: ^
2011-08-18T07:21:52  <eranm> AutomatedTester, yes, let me just see if we can only do it for click. Because getElementSize is using the same code and it will simply return incorrect element size for links
2011-08-18T07:22:31  <AutomatedTester> eranm: that approach is already in the IE driver
2011-08-18T07:22:41  <AutomatedTester> so if we change we may need to change the IE driver

2011-08-18T10:12:14  <jarib> eranm, AutomatedTester: looks like sendKeys will prepend to text fields in Firefox 6 and append in Firefox 5? https://gist.github.com/1154575
2011-08-18T10:14:00  <jarib> if you sendKeys() twice, it works as expected, just happens when there's a value set in the markup
2011-08-18T10:14:02  <kennethkoontz> Can someone explain or point me to an article that explains why Webdriver is better than Selenium 1 in regards to the JS security model? I understand that Webdriver interacts with the HTML of a document rather then the JS. But what does this mean for a tester?
2011-08-18T10:14:53  <ebass> in some instances webdriver uses javascript to perform actions.  it really depends on the browser
2011-08-18T10:15:00  <ebass> afaik
2011-08-18T10:15:51  <kennethkoontz> Hmm... I thought that run js you have to instantiate the jsexecutor and explicitly run js with the execute method.

2011-08-18T10:16:21  <jarib> nope, this is from trunk and on linux
2011-08-18T10:16:38  <jarib> also, <input type=text> and no <textarea>
2011-08-18T10:16:46  <eranm> ahh
2011-08-18T10:16:52  <ebass> right but some of the WebDriver classes execute javascript to getelements and to click on them.
2011-08-18T10:17:09  <ebass> and to get their text.
2011-08-18T10:17:21  <eranm> So perhaps adding a check if the element is an input and of type text to this condition in wrappedElement will solve your problem.
2011-08-18T10:17:34  <jarib> yep. will try

2011-08-18T11:00:43  <simonstewart> G'day all
2011-08-18T11:01:17  <jarib> hi simonstewart
2011-08-18T11:01:24  <carlos> migrated from selenium 1.0.3 - now using selenium-java and selenium-server 2.4.0.  i am using the jetty server included with selenium-server to start up a container with code under test and then test it w/ a webdriver backed selenium fom selenium-java.  tests work great however if i want to debug the test ... the jetty container hangs while the debugger has stopped execution of a thread.
2011-08-18T11:01:41  <carlos> this wasn't the case w/ selenium 1.0.3
2011-08-18T11:02:41  <hubc> carlos: there should have been an error in the server console
2011-08-18T11:02:55  <carlos> before i start digging into the jetty server ... does anyone have any thoughts?  it is my understanding that jetty is spinning its own threads up to handle incoming requests (i see them in my IDEs debug panel)
2011-08-18T11:03:29  <jarib> can someone look at TypingTest.testDeleteAndBackspaceKeys and tell me i'm not crazy to think that test is wrong
2011-08-18T11:04:04  <jarib> surely the last sendKeys call should remove the f and not the e
2011-08-18T11:04:45  <jarib> looks like the change i'm testing fixed it
2011-08-18T11:05:00  <jarib> so it's now failing
2011-08-18T11:05:17  <simonstewart> Loading it up now
2011-08-18T11:05:31  <jarib> (though not sure how it's passing with native events then)
2011-08-18T11:05:33  <carlos> hubc ... sorry if this sounds daft.  but the console doesn't show any error messages.  the requests just hang --- granted this is a pretty contrived condition, but prior to 2.x i was able to set a breakpoint in the test and then manual control the browser (or open another one) and play around with the app.
2011-08-18T11:06:11  <simonstewart> That test looks sane to me
2011-08-18T11:06:12  <carlos> that was a convenient way to tease out problems w/ the tests.  so when i tried that last night to fix a test that was failing after moving to 2.x ... i got a whole lot of blocking.
2011-08-18T11:06:25  <jarib> simonstewart: it does?
2011-08-18T11:06:43  <simonstewart> Aye
2011-08-18T11:06:44  <jarib> so before the last sendKeys, the value is "abcdefgi"
2011-08-18T11:06:45  <hubc> carlos: in my server console, whenever something breaks - it throws an exception and tells me what action it was trying to take and what element
2011-08-18T11:06:48  <simonstewart> Delete deletes to the right
2011-08-18T11:06:53  <simonstewart> Backspace to the left
2011-08-18T11:07:00  <jarib> right
2011-08-18T11:07:19  <simonstewart> The trick is that the cursor isn't changing location between "sendKeys" calls

2011-08-18T11:08:39  <jarib> and that breaks this one.
2011-08-18T11:09:02  <jarib> i guess we should look for a better fix to the original problem then
2011-08-18T11:09:17  <jarib> i.e. why isn't it at the end when first focusing the field
2011-08-18T11:09:29  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-08-18T11:09:51  <simonstewart> That change should break that test
2011-08-18T11:10:04  <simonstewart> Since the behaviour is to do with textareas not inputs
2011-08-18T11:10:04  <carlos> hubc: sorry if i wasn't being clear.  i am starting up the jetty server that is included with selenium-server 2.4.0.  i then fire up a webdriver backed selenium to test that app.  one of my tests was failing.  so i set a breakpoint in that test and i wanted to manually verify/inspect the functionality being tested.  unfortunately it looks like setting a breakpoint didn't just stop the execution of my test, but also stopped jetty fro
2011-08-18T11:10:11  <simonstewart> (though I don't like the inconsistency)
2011-08-18T11:10:28  <carlos> hubc: this isn't really a selenium issue - however it did change from 1.x to 2.x
2011-08-18T11:11:11  <jarib> simonstewart: do you mean "shouldn't break that test"?
2011-08-18T11:11:41  <simonstewart> Skim reading (only just got to my desk)
2011-08-18T11:12:02  <carlos> hubc: i was hoping that someone had noticed it before.  also, when the test does fail i get useful info in the console.  unfortunately the failure doesn't make sense.  it is an alert that doesn't seem to be firing with selenium, but does fire in other browsers.
2011-08-18T11:12:02  <simonstewart> The problem is that the behaviour of sendKeys is inconsistent between textareas and inputs

2011-08-18T11:12:11  <simonstewart> And the question is, what's the right thing to do
2011-08-18T11:12:40  <jarib> simonstewart: in Firefox 6, sendKeys() to <input type=text value=foo> will also prepend (note the value in the markup)
2011-08-18T11:12:50  <simonstewart> For example, is "sendKeys("a"); sendKeys(LEFT); sendKeys("b") the same as sendKeys("a", LEFT, "b")?
2011-08-18T11:12:56  <jarib> which is what i was trying to fix, then realized it breaks typing
2011-08-18T11:13:32  <jarib> right.
2011-08-18T11:13:52  <simonstewart> If the answer is "yes", we should make that consistent

2011-08-18T11:14:51  <jarib> i don't think we should change this behaviour just because FF6 is acting up
2011-08-18T11:15:12  <simonstewart> So the behaviour of leaving the cursor where it is is the desired one, right?
2011-08-18T11:16:00  <jarib> yes, though if the element is not already focused, sendKeys() should place the cursor at the end, no?

2011-08-18T11:52:44  <lukeis> that's not bacon ... that's rotisserie
2011-08-18T11:53:54  <lukeis> eggs are usually found with bacon... but probably not the same bacon simonstewart was refering to ;)
2011-08-18T11:54:15  <krosenvold> cant make a release without breaking some eggs
2011-08-18T11:54:24  <lukeis> huh, touche
2011-08-18T11:55:24  <lukeis> i think this conversation has helped me decide on lunch... mmm bacon burger
2011-08-18T11:56:12  <krosenvold> Running the tests has me running for cheese
2011-08-18T11:56:19  <krosenvold> Fattening
2011-08-18T11:56:32  <lukeis> good point.. i'll add some cheesy goodness too ;)
2011-08-18T11:56:33  <simonstewart> It makes me hunger for peas
2011-08-18T11:57:08  <krosenvold> regular green peas ?
2011-08-18T11:57:41  <simonstewart> Love 'em
2011-08-18T11:58:07  <ChrisCulver> how does one make a container for a list of iwebelements by extracting the locator for each element within the list of Iwebelements
2011-08-18T11:58:08  <lukeis> weird.... sounds like my wife who loves brussel sprouts
2011-08-18T11:58:49  <ChrisCulver> whent he list is retrieved via FindElements()

2011-08-18T12:01:19  <simonstewart> A little bit
2011-08-18T12:01:29  <lukeis> seems to be a lot in there... care to share an example dom and what you want to get?
2011-08-18T12:01:34  <ChrisCulver> I have containers for IWebElements, which i call WrappedSets
2011-08-18T12:01:55  <krosenvold> simonstewart: Will there be bacon ?
2011-08-18T12:01:56  <lukeis> c# lingo is crossing wires some more for me
2011-08-18T12:02:05  <ChrisCulver> I'd like to create a list/array of WrappedSets that i can feed a FindElements() into
2011-08-18T12:02:46  <lukeis> oh, you want a many to many lookup with findElements?
2011-08-18T12:03:13  <ChrisCulver> is it possible to extract the locator for an individual IWebElement that is in the list of IWebElements returned by FindElements()
2011-08-18T12:03:47  <lukeis> well... you don't need to do that... or why would you?   webdriver attaches a unique ID to each element that it uses to refer to them
2011-08-18T12:04:35  <lukeis> if you have the element why do you need to look it up again?
2011-08-18T12:04:41  <ChrisCulver> that way when i use my wrapped set, i can have it find elements off of itself and instead of returning iwebelement, it returns a wrapped set
2011-08-18T12:04:46  *** cheezy has joined #selenium
2011-08-18T12:04:56  <ChrisCulver> or list of wrappedsets
2011-08-18T12:05:13  <lukeis> webdriver caches elements from lookups, does it not? (don't know for sure)
2011-08-18T12:05:16  <ChrisCulver> should i extend IWebElement somehow?
2011-08-18T12:05:52  *** plightbo has joined #selenium
2011-08-18T12:05:57  <ChrisCulver> i should look at SelectElement in the support class more
2011-08-18T12:06:12  <ChrisCulver> does that support FindElement off of it?
2011-08-18T12:06:12  <lukeis> so, you want to lookup in your list of elements based on a normal locator
2011-08-18T12:06:44  <ChrisCulver> yes

2011-08-18T12:08:57  <lukeis> everything i can think of will require calls to the webelement that trigger wire calls... so you might as well just call findElements again

2011-08-18T12:53:32  <lukeis> andref: you could check out from svn the python library directly to your site-packages and then grab the webdriver xpi and dll for ff and ie respectively from the standalone-server jars and copy them in place there to
2011-08-18T12:54:14  <andref> lukeis: svn is limited too
2011-08-18T12:54:34  <lukeis> then you'll have to bundle it yourself in a zip or tar and deploy

2011-08-18T12:59:12  <andref> for chrome ---> :chrome

2011-08-18T13:00:01  <jarib> both :ie and :internet_explorer works

2011-08-18T13:02:56  <autojack> right now I think I'm just creating a new raw Firefox profile every time I run my tests. I want to add an extension to the browser, but I need it to be configured a certain way every time, so I don't think the add_extension() method is enough. can I create a profile template and use that for my tests?
2011-08-18T13:02:59  <andref> explorer..
2011-08-18T13:03:02  <autojack> that's how I did this in Selenium 1.0.

2011-08-18T13:07:09  <autojack> I can see how I can give it a .xpi to include in the browser, but I don't see how I would save the configuration of that plugin across multiple test runs.
2011-08-18T13:07:32  <andref> lukeis: any idea how to install python support on windows?
2011-08-18T13:08:02  <andref> I cannot do it with pip (windows does not have a pip, does it?)
2011-08-18T13:08:56  <lukeis> go download pip.... http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
2011-08-18T13:09:01  <andref> btw. in my company pip would not work(ports limitation)
2011-08-18T13:09:23  <lukeis> then use svn :)
2011-08-18T13:10:23  <andref> svn doesn't work either

2011-08-18T14:24:21  <BenGrailsGuy> When my code fills out a form, clicks a button to go to the next page, how can I detect that the page has changed?
2011-08-18T14:25:03  *** cburroughs has quit IRC
2011-08-18T14:25:49  <lukeis> BenGrailsGuy: how would you normally as a user?  does the url change? other elements on the page you could find?
2011-08-18T14:26:08  <BenGrailsGuy> well
2011-08-18T14:26:19  <BenGrailsGuy> the idea here, is to make 1 function
2011-08-18T14:26:25  <BenGrailsGuy> that will determine if the page has chaned
2011-08-18T14:26:34  <BenGrailsGuy> instead of writing the code everywhere
2011-08-18T14:26:48  <lukeis> i don't have a method like that because there are so many different ways that can happen
2011-08-18T14:27:05  <BenGrailsGuy> man, that's bad news...
2011-08-18T14:27:20  <lukeis> not really...
2011-08-18T14:27:31  <lukeis> implicit wait helps a lot
2011-08-18T14:28:07  <BenGrailsGuy> it is for me. I've got to show my boss that I've built code that is well-though-out. If I can't do simple things like this, im out of luck.
2011-08-18T14:28:44  <lukeis> there's a lot of ways to show that your code it good without doing something like you're suggesting
2011-08-18T14:28:49  <BenGrailsGuy> What do you do, luke?
2011-08-18T14:29:07  <BenGrailsGuy> advise me. please!
2011-08-18T14:29:23  <lukeis> Something similar to PageObjects that has been discussed many times on the mailing lists
2011-08-18T14:29:24  <__mike> you should use page objects
2011-08-18T14:29:31  <lukeis> ^ yep ;)
2011-08-18T14:29:34  <BenGrailsGuy> yeah, i am using page objects :D
2011-08-18T14:29:47  <lukeis> well then... no worries ;)
2011-08-18T14:30:12  <BenGrailsGuy> but does this mean that for ever page object, I have to define how it should determine if the page has loaded? gosh, thats so much messy code
2011-08-18T14:30:16  <ChrisCulver> BenGrailsGuy: pages should return other pages when navigation occurs in a method of that page
2011-08-18T14:30:21  <__mike> you can use webdriverwait to block till an element appears
2011-08-18T14:30:24  <lukeis> my mantra "Know thine app"
2011-08-18T14:31:53  <lukeis> you automation should know and expect all the conditions for what your page can do... like show an error message or go to page x or go to page y
2011-08-18T14:31:58  <BenGrailsGuy> what about someting like a body tag? does an element only "exist" when its opening and end tag are loaded?
2011-08-18T14:32:00  <lukeis> s/you/your/
2011-08-18T14:32:23  <lukeis> webdriver already does that for you, for the most part
2011-08-18T14:32:48  <BenGrailsGuy> what do you mean? it blocks until the body tag is loaded?
2011-08-18T14:33:02  <lukeis> element.click()  will block until the page is loaded
2011-08-18T14:33:14  <AutomatedTester> it blocks until the onLoad event fires
2011-08-18T14:33:17  <lukeis> if there was javascript involved though onclick it may not block
2011-08-18T14:34:45  <lukeis> that's where i say implicit waits are useful... since the next command should be a find of an element that should exist on the next page (but doesn't on the current)... it will wait for that element to appear... this is useful for the javascript case
2011-08-18T14:35:47  <BenGrailsGuy> luke
2011-08-18T14:35:55  <lukeis> page objects though kinda handle that if you do like __mike said and return the next page (as long as you set implicitlyWait on the driver)
2011-08-18T14:36:03  <BenGrailsGuy> what do you do about time-outs? do u have them? I mean, we dont want to wait FOREVER for something to load. right?
2011-08-18T14:36:55  <lukeis> well... i set my waits timeouts to 10 - 15 seconds ... if the page doesn't load in that amount of time I like my test to fail cause that points to a performance issue
2011-08-18T14:37:20  <lukeis> for the implicit / explicit wait.... the get and click don't have a timeout

2011-08-18T14:53:05  <__mike> there isnt'
2011-08-18T14:53:10  <AutomatedTester> BenGrailsGuy: call it as many times as you want
2011-08-18T14:53:29  <AutomatedTester> kennethkoontz: there is a factory in the .NET and Java bindings for it
2011-08-18T14:53:29  *** cakehero has quit IRC
2011-08-18T14:54:21  <kennethkoontz> We are looking into migrating from selenium 1 to selenium 2 and figured it would be a great time to make use of the page object pattern.
2011-08-18T14:54:42  <kennethkoontz> AutomatedTester, ahh, ok. Our testing is currently performed in Python.
2011-08-18T14:54:50  <AutomatedTester> kennethkoontz: you nailed it there, its a pattern not a framework
2011-08-18T14:55:34  <AutomatedTester> the factory does a little work for you using the Factory design pattern
2011-08-18T14:55:44  <__mike> whoa what
2011-08-18T14:55:49  <kennethkoontz> But none in python, correct?
2011-08-18T14:55:50  <__mike> where is the factory in java ?!
2011-08-18T14:55:59  <AutomatedTester> __mike: in support
2011-08-18T14:56:04  <AutomatedTester> no
2011-08-18T14:56:20  <kennethkoontz> AutomatedTester, are you using sel2?
2011-08-18T14:56:22  <AutomatedTester> kennethkoontz: it uses decorators on variables
2011-08-18T14:56:27  <kennethkoontz> Webdriver, specifically.
2011-08-18T14:56:31  <AutomatedTester> kennethkoontz: yes
2011-08-18T14:56:37  <kennethkoontz> How did your migration go?
2011-08-18T14:56:37  <AutomatedTester> i maintain the python code
2011-08-18T14:56:45  <AutomatedTester> we rewrote things
2011-08-18T14:57:30  <AutomatedTester> and when we do other projects, because we invested time in a good DSL, it should be light work
2011-08-18T14:58:16  <AutomatedTester> my advice is refactor your tests into a good DSL
2011-08-18T14:58:24  <kennethkoontz> DSL?
2011-08-18T14:58:34  <AutomatedTester> Domain Specific Language
2011-08-18T14:58:35  <kennethkoontz> domain specific language?
2011-08-18T14:59:04  <AutomatedTester> Page Objects pattern is a way to do that
2011-08-18T14:59:11  <AutomatedTester> do that first, then migrate

2011-08-18T21:24:39  <dawagner> Woo, made the bus!
2011-08-18T21:25:44  <lukeis> Glynnis: you don't see IEDriver.dll in either the win32 nor 64 directories?  also that error seems odd to me as to why there's a dll in there... can you create an :newissue and cc automatedtester?  For the IEDriver.dll, if you don't have the dll in there, you can download the tar from the pypi page and copy them in place

2011-08-18T21:27:19  <Glynnis> lukeis, there's even no win32 and x64 directory there,ok,I'll create an issue,thanks
2011-08-18T21:28:05  <lukeis> can you try to unpack the tar and grab the 64 version and put it in there?
2011-08-18T21:28:11  <lukeis> might get you working for now
2011-08-18T21:28:20  <lukeis> but yeah, still a problem most likely
2011-08-18T21:29:05  <Glynnis> lukeis, I have copied it to that directory,IE could be launched now,but it can't open my link
2011-08-18T21:29:44  <Glynnis> lukeis, do u know the other error in firefox on win7:https://gist.github.com/1155775
2011-08-18T21:30:32  <lukeis> dawagner: uppercase method names? doesn't that go against the styleguide?

2011-08-18T21:31:05  <lukeis> and i don't have a windows box near me
