2011-03-30T05:35:29  <AutomatedTester> primehaxor: I use pytest xdist plugin for parallel execution
2011-03-30T05:36:07  <primehaxor> AutomatedTester, ahhhh u kidding me right ? =]
2011-03-30T05:36:16  <primehaxor> you have some example?
2011-03-30T05:36:17  *** anatoli_ has quit IRC
2011-03-30T05:36:38  <AutomatedTester> its command line
2011-03-30T05:36:53  <AutomatedTester> so each of my tests creates a new Selenium object
2011-03-30T05:36:54  <primehaxor> hmm
2011-03-30T05:37:13  <AutomatedTester> and then in the command line add the arg -n X where X is the amount of threads
2011-03-30T05:37:24  <primehaxor> AutomatedTester, im rewriting some part of code to use subprocses
2011-03-30T05:37:49  <AutomatedTester> how are you going to handle reporting?
2011-03-30T05:38:03  <primehaxor> stdout
2011-03-30T05:38:27  <AutomatedTester> CIs tend to like xunit style reporting
2011-03-30T05:38:29  <primehaxor> im using a selenium + selenium python rc + mysql to store the profiling values
2011-03-30T05:38:53  <primehaxor> mysql + sqlalchemy

2011-03-30T06:32:34  <zack> Hi guys
2011-03-30T06:32:54  *** Archdude has joined #selenium
2011-03-30T06:32:57  <zack> I'm a newbie here at selenium
2011-03-30T06:33:10  <AutomatedTester> hey zack
2011-03-30T06:33:31  <zack> I'm interested in working on google summer of code for selenium, do any of you guys know about anything related to that ?
2011-03-30T06:33:45  <AutomatedTester> I am one of the admins
2011-03-30T06:33:55  <AutomatedTester> did you have a project in mind?
2011-03-30T06:34:53  <AutomatedTester> :wiki gsoc
2011-03-30T06:34:53  <zack> Hi auto
2011-03-30T06:34:54  <selbot2> 1: GoogleSummerOfCode: Featuredgsocdev - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/GoogleSummerOfCode
2011-03-30T06:34:54  <selbot2> (+ 1 more)
2011-03-30T06:35:05  *** Archdude_ has quit IRC
2011-03-30T06:35:06  <zack> well, the thing is I have gone through the wiki
2011-03-30T06:35:22  <zack> it has some great and inspiring ideas I'd really like to work with
2011-03-30T06:35:38  <AutomatedTester> cool
2011-03-30T06:35:56  <zack> but the thing is, well the archieves are dated back to 2010 and the timeline is also aligned to d last year's GSoC
2011-03-30T06:36:25  <zack> I mean, effectively the timeline hasn't been changed and I wonder whether the content also hasn't been changed!
2011-03-30T06:36:55  <AutomatedTester> the project ideas are new
2011-03-30T06:36:56  <zack> so does that mean can I still work on the project ideas that are mentioned in the wiki page or are they already implemented ?
2011-03-30T06:37:15  <AutomatedTester> the ideas are new, the other stuff may have been overlooked
2011-03-30T06:37:51  <zack> awesome!
2011-03-30T06:38:04  <zack> I like the scriptable proxy idea very much
2011-03-30T06:38:14  <zack> I'm thinking of applying for it
2011-03-30T06:38:47  <zack> but I don't have much exposure to selenium though, would that be ok ?
2011-03-30T06:39:07  <AutomatedTester> as long as you are willing to learn quickly
2011-03-30T06:39:14  <AutomatedTester> then I dont see an issue
2011-03-30T06:39:33  <AutomatedTester> we go through each of the applications fairly
2011-03-30T06:40:00  <zack> of course, I do have a very steep learning curve and I have a lot of exposure in working in FOSS environment as well
2011-03-30T06:40:17  <zack> I'm an undergraduate in Software Engineering :)
2011-03-30T06:41:13  <zack> Do you know how I can contact Mr. Patrick Lightbody ? he's the mentor as mentioned in the idea
2011-03-30T06:41:28  <selbot2> theautomatedtester less than 20 seconds ago - DavidBurns Updated dates and links for GSoC - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11837
2011-03-30T06:43:07  <nirvdrum> This wiki names thing we're doing for commit messages is rather annoying.
2011-03-30T06:43:33  <AutomatedTester> nirvdrum: its quite useful if you look at the commits via RSS
2011-03-30T06:43:44  <AutomatedTester> which I know a lot of people do
2011-03-30T06:43:48  <nirvdrum> I'm cool with just following SVN names.
2011-03-30T06:44:03  <nirvdrum> And it strikes me that writing some sort of filter script would be more reliable.
2011-03-30T06:44:12  <AutomatedTester> zack: email the developer mailing list
2011-03-30T06:44:14  <nirvdrum> Since invariably someone forgets to follow the convention.
2011-03-30T06:44:32  <zack> ok auto! thanks for the tip
2011-03-30T06:44:42  <AutomatedTester> or email Adam
2011-03-30T06:45:07  <zack> I take it all of you guys in the channel are developers in d chain? I'm really glad to meet you all! :)

2011-03-30T06:45:54  <zack> any of you have any great ideas for the Google Summer of Code ? I'm interested in hearing them out and try to develop and make them work :)
2011-03-30T06:46:06  <zack> I'm based in Sri Lanka auto :)
2011-03-30T06:46:26  <zack> where are you based ? USA I suppose ?
2011-03-30T06:46:31  <AutomatedTester> UK
2011-03-30T06:47:23  <zack> ok cool, do you have some more project ideas I can look into ? I get a lot of free time these days and I'm really interested in selenium framework
2011-03-30T06:47:44  <AutomatedTester> we are still formulating ideas
2011-03-30T06:47:49  <AutomatedTester> and making sure we have mentors
2011-03-30T06:48:25  <zack> great
2011-03-30T06:48:37  <zack> I'll be hanging out here a lot more then I suppose :)

2011-03-30T07:43:26  <hobbit> I have an artificial firefox profile with webdriver.xpi unpacked
2011-03-30T07:43:41  <AutomatedTester> start firefox with the -silent argument
2011-03-30T07:43:43  <antlong> AutomatedTester, ;) http://d.pr/AuTL
2011-03-30T07:43:52  <hobbit> ...
2011-03-30T07:43:56  <AutomatedTester> and then start it normally
2011-03-30T07:44:03  <AutomatedTester> the silent will clean the profile up
2011-03-30T07:44:24  *** esteele has joined #selenium
2011-03-30T07:44:29  <AutomatedTester> plus the language bindings do some magic with user.js before starting firefox
2011-03-30T07:44:57  <AutomatedTester> antlong: compare the xpath in the screenshot with the xpath in the stacktrace
2011-03-30T07:45:02  <AutomatedTester> they are different ;P
2011-03-30T07:45:14  <AutomatedTester> 1 char different

2011-03-30T07:46:28  <antlong> AutomatedTester, yeah - in the test they are all correct

2011-03-30T07:47:20  <hobbit> unfortunately, this is an automated environment and I can't manually install things
2011-03-30T07:47:43  <AutomatedTester> hobbit: why do you want to manually install the xpi?
2011-03-30T07:47:47  <AutomatedTester> <- curious
2011-03-30T07:48:07  <hobbit> I don't. What's a better way than manually unpacking it? I'm not root on the machine, too.
2011-03-30T07:48:28  <hobbit> ah, you're talking about language bindings
2011-03-30T07:48:43  <AutomatedTester> yup
2011-03-30T07:48:52  <hobbit> this is a little complicated, but I'm controlling firefox from outside the chroot environment
2011-03-30T07:48:52  <jimevans> hobbit: when you're using the webdriver api from a programming language like java, python or ruby, the langauge binding handles the unpacking and installation for you

2011-03-30T07:49:23  <antlong> AutomatedTester, balls i see it now
2011-03-30T07:49:28  <AutomatedTester> :D
2011-03-30T07:49:34  <antlong> hahaha
2011-03-30T07:49:34  <antlong> nice catch
2011-03-30T07:49:34  <jimevans> basically by creating an anonymous profile in /usr/tmp, and installing the webdriver extension into that profile.
2011-03-30T07:49:49  <hobbit> and firefox is running inside the chroot environemnt
2011-03-30T07:49:55  <antlong> however there is a bug there

2011-03-30T07:52:34  <AutomatedTester> and then build the profile in there and use that folder
2011-03-30T07:53:08  <jimevans> yeah... i meant '/tmp/' not '/usr/tmp'...
2011-03-30T07:53:17  <hobbit> that's where I got my artificial profile
2011-03-30T07:53:32  <hobbit> must be something different in a way I'm starting firefox

2011-03-30T10:22:11  <notdiminoten> so it's pretty much impossible to add an extra search strategy to the PageFactory annotation classes, isn't it
2011-03-30T10:22:23  <notdiminoten> short of creating your own annotation
2011-03-30T10:22:24  <simonstewart> It's pretty easy
2011-03-30T10:22:32  <simonstewart> But you need to create your own annotation
2011-03-30T10:22:35  <notdiminoten> hah
2011-03-30T10:22:43  <simonstewart> It doesn't actually take that much code
2011-03-30T10:23:01  <notdiminoten> I've been trying to do it without a new annotation
2011-03-30T10:23:08  <notdiminoten> my bad I guess heh
2011-03-30T10:23:24  <simonstewart> Trying to find a link for you

2011-03-30T10:42:46  <selbot2>  open/new Chrome is instantiated on a remote server instead of [requested] Internet Explorer - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1482

2011-03-30T11:12:09  <notdiminoten> is there a specific reason the FindBy annotation is not inheritable, specifically will I get into trouble if I make my custom annotation inheritable
2011-03-30T11:12:12  <simonstewart> hi
2011-03-30T11:12:12  <lord1234> can someone help me with xpath?
2011-03-30T11:12:24  <notdiminoten> or is it not a big deal
2011-03-30T11:12:34  <simonstewart> Because you can get the magic of the Annotations class to get most of the behaviour
2011-03-30T11:13:02  <simonstewart> Put another way, I strongly favour composition over inheritance
2011-03-30T11:13:09  <notdiminoten> fair enough
2011-03-30T11:13:12  <simonstewart> :)
2011-03-30T11:15:29  <lord1234> i have an Xpath /html/body/div/div[4]/div/div[2]/ul/li/a  where the text of the <a> is "Overview" and the <li> has a special @class='selected'.  I also have a lot of other <li>'s with similar values, but they don't have that @ class.  how would you specify that you only care about the 'selected' <li>?
2011-03-30T11:15:29  <krosenvold_> +100000 for composition over inheritance
2011-03-30T11:16:12  <antlong> lord1234 li[contains(@class, 'selected')]
2011-03-30T11:16:28  <lord1234> sorry lemme restate
2011-03-30T11:16:31  <lord1234> i only care if the overview is selected
2011-03-30T11:16:36  <lord1234> if anything is selected, i don't care
2011-03-30T11:16:45  <lord1234> anything else
2011-03-30T11:16:54  <antlong> lord1234 retype your question please
2011-03-30T11:17:19  <lord1234> i have an Xpath /html/body/div/div[4]/div/div[2]/ul/li/a  where the text of the <a> is "Overview" and the <li> has a special @class='selected'.  I also have a lot of other <li>'s with similar values, but they don't have that @ class.  how would you specify that you only care about the 'selected' Overview <li> ?
2011-03-30T11:17:44  <lord1234> overivew is in li[1], there is an li[2] but li[2] is not selected and has text of "test"
2011-03-30T11:18:10  <antlong>  /li[@class = 'selected']/a[text() = 'Overview']
2011-03-30T11:19:17  <andytinkham> lord1234: //li[@class='selected' and ./a[contains(., 'Overview')]] would be my guess
2011-03-30T11:19:42  <antlong>  //li[@class = 'selected']/a[text() = 'Overview']
2011-03-30T11:19:50  <andytinkham> Oops - didn't scroll enough to see antlong's answer :)
2011-03-30T11:20:33  <andytinkham> And on re-reading, his is better than mine (Mine gives you the li element when it looks like you want the a)
2011-03-30T11:21:55  <lord1234> yea i want the a
2011-03-30T11:21:56  <lord1234> cool
2011-03-30T11:21:56  <lord1234> thanks
2011-03-30T11:22:07  <lord1234> do you have any decent tools for finding xpath?
2011-03-30T11:23:03  <lord1234> i use firefinder
2011-03-30T11:23:07  <lord1234> for testing
2011-03-30T11:23:10  <antlong> firepath
2011-03-30T11:23:35  <andytinkham> lord1234: I've got XPather and Firebug/Firefinder installed, but they don't always give non-brittle xpaths so I tend to see what they give me and then tweak heavily
2011-03-30T11:24:06  <antlong> only complaint about firepath is how it adds . infront of xpaths automatically
2011-03-30T11:24:59  <antlong> actually, its also kind of retarded. it will give you //[@id = 'foo']/a/b/c instead of (assuming c has a set @id) [//[@id = 'c']
2011-03-30T11:25:36  <simonstewart> antlong: the "." is important
2011-03-30T11:25:49  <antlong> simonstewart, ive never used it before
2011-03-30T11:25:52  <simonstewart> It basically says that xpaths should be relative to the given node
2011-03-30T11:26:04  <simonstewart> whereas "//" means "search the entire document"
2011-03-30T11:26:17  <simonstewart> In Selenium 1, we always searched the entire doc
2011-03-30T11:26:26  <antlong> yeah im still on se1 @ work
2011-03-30T11:26:31  <simonstewart> But in Selenium 2, the element.find_element methods search relative to the node
2011-03-30T11:26:38  <simonstewart> unless you use "//"
2011-03-30T11:27:05  <antlong> simonstewart, oh speaking of, how is selenium backed webdriver going?
2011-03-30T11:27:13  <simonstewart> For Java: great

2011-03-30T11:43:48  <simonstewart> You'll notice that the areas that are "best" in each of the language bindings are where people spend a majority of their time

2011-03-30T14:15:47  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: I'm considering deprecating .GetWindowHandle() and .GetWindowHandles() methods in favor of .CurrentWindow and .Windows properties respectively. Thought?
2011-03-30T14:15:54  <jimevans> s/Thought?/Thoughts?
2011-03-30T14:16:01  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: +1
2011-03-30T14:16:09  <AutomatedTester> i was going to do the same in python
2011-03-30T14:16:16  *** simonstewart has quit IRC
2011-03-30T14:16:24  <jimevans> that's why i asked. :)
2011-03-30T14:16:27  <AutomatedTester> simon closed the wrong window
2011-03-30T14:17:06  <AutomatedTester> properties in python are like .NET so definitely +1 from me
2011-03-30T14:17:23  <jimevans> groovy then.
2011-03-30T14:18:08  <jimevans> wait for it...
2011-03-30T14:18:55  <selbot2> james.h.evans.jr half a minute ago - JimEvans: Deprecating .NET .GetWindowHandle() and .GetWindowHandles() methods in favor of .CurrentWindow and .Windows properties respectively. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11842
2011-03-30T14:19:03  <jimevans> there it is!
2011-03-30T14:20:28  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: I am trying to get the API calls as idiomatic as possible
2011-03-30T14:21:30  <jimevans> I agree. I'm also going off of the first pass of the IDL that Simon checked in a few weeks ago.
2011-03-30T14:22:37  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: thats where I really noticed value
2011-03-30T14:22:43  <AutomatedTester> and why I didnt want it anymore
2011-03-30T14:23:16  <AutomatedTester> my thought is we are a framework and people can extend us
2011-03-30T14:23:34  <AutomatedTester> so helper methods/extension methods can easily be created

2011-03-30T14:25:55  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: time for a new one?
2011-03-30T14:26:00  <jimevans> simonstewart: true.
2011-03-30T14:26:11  <simonstewart> The latest OS X update is proving unstable
2011-03-30T14:26:17  <simonstewart> I prolly just need a new point release
2011-03-30T14:26:37  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: its seemingly more stable than the one before
2011-03-30T14:26:40  <AutomatedTester> well for me
2011-03-30T14:27:24  <simonstewart> I get the opposite
2011-03-30T14:27:26  <simonstewart> Oh well
2011-03-30T14:28:01  <AutomatedTester> i found the wifi is more stable for me
2011-03-30T14:28:53  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-03-30T14:31:54  <jimevans> simonstewart: in the vein of "what do we name things in the api", i'd like to spend some quality time with the IDL and get cracking on the RenderedWebElement thing.
2011-03-30T14:32:09  <jimevans> someday, that is.
2011-03-30T14:32:23  <simonstewart> Once I get the update into the google codebase, rendered webelement is next on my list
2011-03-30T14:32:35  <simonstewart> You'll notice that I've deprecated value already
2011-03-30T14:32:57  <simonstewart> But I don't want to do anything major cos the current update has taken a long time to get this far
2011-03-30T14:32:57  <jimevans> yes. AutomatedTester and I have followed suit with Python and .NET. :)
2011-03-30T14:33:03  <simonstewart> I saw :)
2011-03-30T14:33:20  * AutomatedTester is deprecating left right and center
2011-03-30T14:33:42  <AutomatedTester> when I am finished you will call a browser and thats all you can do
2011-03-30T14:33:45  <jimevans> you're talking about updating the internal codebase at google?
2011-03-30T14:33:57  <simonstewart> yeah

2011-03-30T14:34:15  <simonstewart> But the update needs to Not Break Anything
2011-03-30T14:34:25  <jimevans> naturally.
2011-03-30T14:34:43  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: i noticed the python chromedriver is not happy with get_attribute
2011-03-30T14:34:50  <simonstewart> It'd be a lot more fun if I could break stuff
2011-03-30T14:35:02  <simonstewart> The new one should be out before seconf
2011-03-30T14:35:10  <simonstewart> If everything goes according to apln
2011-03-30T14:35:16  <AutomatedTester> woo hoo
2011-03-30T14:35:34  <jimevans> heh. knowing .net isn't used by as many people makes it easier to make rash, snap decisions according to my whims.
2011-03-30T14:35:37  <AutomatedTester> Eran said he was going to introduce me to some Chromium people at the conference
2011-03-30T14:36:00  <AutomatedTester> since they want moar tests
2011-03-30T14:36:03  * jimevans is really looking forward to rewriting the .NET ChromeDriver
2011-03-30T14:36:24  <jimevans> ^^ does that make me sick?
2011-03-30T14:36:28  <simonstewart> s/rewrite/delete/
2011-03-30T14:36:46  <simonstewart> It just becomes a straight forward remote driver
2011-03-30T14:36:53  * AutomatedTester hopes the new chromedriver will be like the IE driver
2011-03-30T14:37:00  <simonstewart> How so?
2011-03-30T14:37:08  <AutomatedTester> small and succint
2011-03-30T14:37:11  <AutomatedTester> succinct even
2011-03-30T14:37:22  <AutomatedTester> i think the IE driver is like 80 lines of code
2011-03-30T14:37:30  <jimevans> simonstewart: yes, but there does need to be some scaffolding around starting the ChromeDriver exe, no?
2011-03-30T14:37:40  <simonstewart> A little

2011-03-30T14:38:51  <jimevans> Have you decided whether you'll try to embed chromedriver.exe into the .jar for Java, or are you going to depend on the user making sure it's available?
2011-03-30T14:39:04  <simonstewart> Probably the latter
2011-03-30T14:40:56  <jimevans> Fair enough. It might be time to convert the IE driver into it's own exe too.

2011-03-30T14:45:50  <jimevans> XCulver: You mean like clearing the cache? No, we don't do anything special to avoid it, as far as I'm aware. I know the IE driver doesn't for sure.
