2011-05-30T01:59:29  <tcarpentier> hi! After searching a lot on the Internet, i don't find a good solution to automate upload file action using selenium2. Do you have some tips or some solutions to help me? The only solution i've seen i need is to use another tools , but there are no solutions using only selenium? Thanks

2011-05-30T02:20:13  <freynaud> tcarpentier: you can enter the path in the field directly. You don't have to test the file chooser, that's a piece of the OS, not of the site
2011-05-30T02:22:00  <tcarpentier> freynaud:effectively , i will try....thanks
2011-05-30T02:23:55  <freynaud> tcarpentier: there should be a part taking care of sending the file from the test to the remote if you're using a RemoteWebDribver
2011-05-30T02:25:43  <tcarpentier> freynaud:  for the moment i don't use the remoteWebDriver, just webdriver in local  and it's works! thanks..
2011-05-30T02:26:01  <freynaud> you should use remote from the begining
2011-05-30T02:26:12  <freynaud> otherwise you'll have to refactor to scale

2011-05-30T10:43:34  <mydog2> freynaud, - so does selenium attach to the local copy of firefox??
2011-05-30T10:43:53  <freynaud> mydog2: depends how you launch it
2011-05-30T10:44:06  <freynaud> you can target something remotly
2011-05-30T10:44:11  <freynaud> using RemoveWebDriver
2011-05-30T10:44:21  <freynaud> otherwise it uses your local browser installs
2011-05-30T10:45:41  <mydog2> i'm trying to understand if it's possible to write an app, where i can pass into it the url to target.. so i can have 5-10 copies running in parallel.. the idea is that i would use the underlying browser function/aspects to handle the javascript/cookies for the request headers..
2011-05-30T10:45:55  *** dmachi has joined #selenium
2011-05-30T10:45:56  <mydog2> i've used htmlunit.. but not selenium..
2011-05-30T10:46:50  *** pngl has quit IRC
2011-05-30T10:47:05  <freynaud> selenium is a standard API that interacts with a browser
2011-05-30T10:47:18  <freynaud> the browser can be firefox, ie ... or htmlunit too
2011-05-30T10:47:53  <freynaud> and you can run tests in parallel using you local resources, or multiple machines if you want to distribute the tests more

2011-05-30T10:51:59  <mydog2> freynaud, - so can multiple apps connect to the same instance of the browser at the same time..??
2011-05-30T10:52:25  <freynaud> i'm not sure i understand what you want to do
2011-05-30T10:52:37  <freynaud> you can have the same exe of firefox for several users
2011-05-30T10:52:51  <freynaud> but each user will control a separate instance of it
2011-05-30T10:53:00  <freynaud> you need to install only one
2011-05-30T10:53:22  <freynaud> but if user1 sign in , user2 won't see it. The tests remain independant
2011-05-30T10:54:14  <mydog2> i have 10 urls.. i want to create a shell script that would call the selenium test app, pass each copy a different url, and run the test apps in parallel.. so i'll have 10 different pages fetched at the same time..
2011-05-30T10:54:41  <freynaud> that you can do easily
2011-05-30T10:54:56  <freynaud> but not to generate load on a webserver though
2011-05-30T10:55:07  <mydog2> great...  assuming the resources (mem/cpu) aren't to much!!
2011-05-30T10:55:38  <mydog2> freynaud,  this is simply to fetch pages... i'm more interested in the javascript/cookie/headers being handled correctly..
2011-05-30T10:55:46  <freynaud> the overhead of selenium isn't much
2011-05-30T10:55:57  <freynaud> that will be the same as having 10 firefox running
2011-05-30T10:56:23  <freynaud> to test the functionality, selenium is ideal
2011-05-30T10:56:32  <mydog2> right... which will be a serious load on the box...
2011-05-30T10:57:06  <freynaud> not really
2011-05-30T10:57:13  <freynaud> like 50Mb of ram per firefox
2011-05-30T10:57:38  <freynaud> you cannot have it for free :) even htmunit takes resources if you activate JS support
2011-05-30T10:58:31  <mydog2> really?? that small?? i'm looking at top.. and although i have a bunch of copies of ff running.. it's showing ~18% mem of a 4G system..
2011-05-30T10:58:52  <mydog2> although i do have multiple tabs in each ff instance..
2011-05-30T10:59:44  <freynaud> but you have a lot of add on
2011-05-30T10:59:58  <freynaud> if you start firefox using firefox -P
2011-05-30T11:00:00  <mydog2> right...
2011-05-30T11:00:02  <freynaud> create a new profile
2011-05-30T11:00:10  <freynaud> you will see what selenium will use
2011-05-30T11:00:25  <mydog2> cool...
2011-05-30T11:00:40  <mydog2> now i have just have to find someone that I can talk to on this..
2011-05-30T11:00:53  <mydog2> you're not in the cali/bay area are you??
2011-05-30T11:03:20  <freynaud> no, why ?
2011-05-30T11:03:33  <freynaud> you should find everything you need on the wiki
2011-05-30T11:03:42  <freynaud> if you don't, we can update the pages
2011-05-30T11:08:26  <mydog2> thanks.. basically.. i want to install it.. get it up and running on fedora 13.. and then fetch a couple of pages.. where I can test the request/response headers from the firefox interaction/process...
2011-05-30T11:08:55  <freynaud> for the headers I'm not sure
2011-05-30T11:09:10  <freynaud> selenium is testing page feature
2011-05-30T11:09:21  <freynaud> headers are a bit differen
2011-05-30T11:10:19  <freynaud> install should take no time
2011-05-30T11:10:24  <freynaud> it's just a jar to download
2011-05-30T11:10:34  <freynaud> there is no setup
2011-05-30T11:10:45  <mydog2> i need the headers.. other wise the pages that i'm targeting because they're heavily javascript, I won't know if they're really working..
2011-05-30T11:11:25  <freynaud> why do you need the header for JS ?
2011-05-30T11:11:55  <mydog2> need the headers to verify that the function works if there's an issue...
2011-05-30T11:11:56  <freynaud> you should do what a user do, and validate that the page does what it should
2011-05-30T11:12:20  <mydog2> i'm not testing... i'm looking to fetch the page/data
2011-05-30T11:12:20  <freynaud> the hhtp headers ?
2011-05-30T11:12:32  *** rpk has quit IRC
2011-05-30T11:12:55  <mydog2> within firefox i can inspect the headers/cookies.. from the request/response

2011-05-30T11:13:10  <mydog2> i would expect that i should get the same page/data
2011-05-30T11:13:16  <mydog2> in firebug, yes
2011-05-30T11:14:32  <freynaud> selenium is a testing tool. I'm not sure I understnad how you're validating using headers cookies
2011-05-30T11:14:36  <freynaud> do you have an example ?

2011-05-30T11:17:06  <mydog2> freynaud,  - my bad.. i'm confusing you.. i'm going to be automatically submitting the link for the page and i'm looking to auto fetch the page. in order to fetch the page. i need to be able to send the correct headers/cookies. i would expect that this happens correctly behind the scene.. but if it doesn't i'd want to be able to inspect the headers sent between the app/server..

2011-05-30T11:18:00  <freynaud> selenium will not send the headers or cookies
2011-05-30T11:18:12  <freynaud> selenium controls the browser, and the browser does that
2011-05-30T11:18:49  <freynaud> when you use the firefox driver for instance, and open www.google.com, it's sending what you would have by typing it manually in FF
2011-05-30T11:18:54  <mydog2> right...
2011-05-30T11:19:35  <mydog2> and if i then fired of firebug.. i'd see the response/request headers.. is there a way to access this data from selenium.
2011-05-30T11:20:56  *** dmachi has quit IRC
2011-05-30T11:21:26  <freynaud> i don't know. Selenium is to simulate user actions. You need some network traffic sniffing, that's a big different
2011-05-30T11:22:39  <mydog2> within htmlunit.. i can insepect/set the headers if i need to... i was hoping selenium would replicate that as well..
2011-05-30T11:23:33  <rpk> Question: if both selenium and watir are going to primarily run on top of webdriver, what is the difference between the two?  Just that selenium will be more up to date as webdriver and selenium merged?

2011-05-30T13:22:15  <threexk> hello.  Is there a way to determine the directory that a test suite is located in?  I'm trying to upload a file as a part of a test.  The file is in a path relative to the test suite file.
2011-05-30T13:23:11  <threexk> works fine if I give an absolute path, but that's no good if someone else tries to use the test suite
2011-05-30T13:31:46  <threexk> (I am using Selenium IDE.)
2011-05-30T13:31:59  <rpk> threexk: Is there a reason you can't build the directory path using your language of choice?
2011-05-30T13:33:50  <threexk> yes, I could.  The file is located relative to the test suite, so I think I need some way to get the path of the test suite.
2011-05-30T13:34:16  <threexk> I'm not sure if the path information is preserved after opening a test suite in Selenium IDE, though?
2011-05-30T13:35:02  <threexk> On my machine the file is in /home/threexk/selenium_tests/upload_test.jpg.  But I cannot know what path someone else will have the tests in.
2011-05-30T13:35:32  <rpk> Well, if you were using a lanugage, you could store this information in configuration files
2011-05-30T13:36:19  <threexk> do you mean as opposed to Selenium IDE?
2011-05-30T13:36:33  <rpk> and then read the information out, but in that case just execute the test from the language and not the ide, at which point you can just use the local directory
2011-05-30T13:36:38  <threexk> that seems like a good idea
2011-05-30T13:37:04  <rpk> threexk: apparently most people don't use the ide to write tests, most just use a language implementation, which I've found to be a better approach as well

2011-05-30T13:40:22  <threexk> rpk: I see.  For filling in tons of form fields, the IDE seems quite useful.  I suppose I could record that in the IDE and transform it into a script somehow.
2011-05-30T13:41:20  <threexk> (without using the IDE you'd have to get the machine names for every form field you fill out, which is tedious)

2011-05-30T13:47:37  <threexk> Is there a way to prompt the user for an input, and have the test fail or succeed depending on what they enter?
2011-05-30T13:48:17  <threexk> I have a verification step that would be really painful to automate :)
2011-05-30T13:50:08  <threexk> storePrompt looks promising

2011-05-30T13:58:45  <mydog2> ok guys.. ready to take the plunge.. i'm running fedora 13.. can someone point me to a simple/straight install this to get your 1st test running app
2011-05-30T13:58:47  <threexk> good idea, thanks
2011-05-30T14:02:18  <rpk> mydog2: see the documentation on the Selenium page?
2011-05-30T14:03:14  <mydog2>  rpk  - i looked, and am still looking... there are 10-25 files to download...
2011-05-30T14:05:27  <rpk> oh, just grab the client libraries, are you using selenium 2 or 1?
2011-05-30T14:05:45  <mydog2> new to selenium.. so nothing yet!
2011-05-30T14:05:50  <mydog2> is there a diff?
2011-05-30T14:05:58  <mydog2> between 1 and 2 that is..
2011-05-30T14:06:34  <rpk> Selenium 2 is built on top of webdriver.  Just go with Selenium 2.
2011-05-30T14:07:28  <mydog2> so i get the selenium-server-standalone.jar or just the selenium-java.zip?
2011-05-30T14:07:49  <rpk> where are you looking to download from?  the beta3?
2011-05-30T14:08:33  <rpk> mydog2: http://seleniumhq.org/download/  See Selenium client drivers?
2011-05-30T14:08:44  <mydog2> the page i'm on is code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list
2011-05-30T14:08:58  <rpk> then follow the tutorial here: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html
2011-05-30T14:09:48  <mydog2> right.. i was there.. and i went to the downloads link.. and saw the files i just mentioned..
2011-05-30T14:10:03  <rpk> So pull the client driver for your language?

2011-05-30T14:10:47  <mydog2> and that's why i asked if i need the server jar as well as the zip?
2011-05-30T14:11:37  <rpk> Oh, no, you don't need the server jar
2011-05-30T14:12:15  <mydog2> what about the selenium-remote-control zip from 2010? do i need that?
2011-05-30T14:12:22  <rpk> Nope
2011-05-30T14:12:30  <rpk> just the client libraries
2011-05-30T14:12:48  <mydog2> so i'll just download the selenium-java--.zip
2011-05-30T14:12:50  <rpk> that will let you run your tests locally, which will be enough to start with.
2011-05-30T14:12:51  <rpk> Yep
2011-05-30T14:13:18  <mydog2> locally.. meaning through an instance of firefox, eight?
2011-05-30T14:13:21  <mydog2> right?
2011-05-30T14:13:21  <rpk> Later on, when you want to run tests on remote machines, or in parallel against remote machines, you'll need the selenium standalone jar.
2011-05-30T14:13:35  <rpk> mydog2: yeah, or whatever other browser you choose
2011-05-30T14:13:39  <mydog2> ok...
2011-05-30T14:13:52  <mydog2> so let me keep reading for a min..
2011-05-30T14:13:54  <mydog2> thanks..
2011-05-30T14:13:59  <rpk> yep, np
2011-05-30T14:19:39  <threexk> one last question: How can you verify the value of a Selenium variable?
2011-05-30T14:19:59  <threexk> Do you have to use verifyEval() or is there a more direct way?
2011-05-30T14:28:04  <threexk> nevermind, I think verifyEval() will do fine.  thanks
2011-05-30T14:38:31  <mydog2> rpk,  - ok.. i downloaded the   selenium-java-2.0b3.zip - put the jar files in a dir...  and am looking at the docs.. i want to create a test file, same as in the install page.. i don't have an ide... but i should be able to compile against the dir with the jar files, right?
2011-05-30T14:40:47  <rpk> yeah, though you should really just get eclipse for java developers
2011-05-30T14:41:07  <rpk> http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/moreinfo/java.php
2011-05-30T14:41:42  <rpk> oh, and do yourself a favor and install the jdk too, and then install eclipse against the jdk rather than the jre (it'll prevent issues with some plugins requireing the jdk)
2011-05-30T14:46:28  <mydog2> rpk,  - how do i run the sample test without getting eclipse..and then learning all of that..
2011-05-30T14:47:13  <mydog2> [root@dell-1 parseapp2]# javac -classpath '/opt/selenium/lib/*:/apps/parseapp2/' stest.java

2011-05-30T14:47:33  <mydog2> sorry about that..  thought it was 2 lines..
2011-05-30T14:47:40  <rpk> mydog2:  why are you hitting remote web driver in the first place?
2011-05-30T14:48:13  <mydog2> i did the simple 5 min to start!!! http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html <<<
2011-05-30T14:48:14  <rpk> you should be running against a specific driver, unless you have remote or grid setup
2011-05-30T14:48:19  <mydog2> and copied the test app
2011-05-30T14:49:52  <rpk> oh, sorry, hmm I wonder if the inheritance tree is opposite the direction I thought it was.  oh well. anyways, can you check that the libraries are getting compiled in correctly?
2011-05-30T14:50:49  <rpk> Getting eclipse is really fairly easy though, you need not use the jdk if you don't want to, I just recommend it
2011-05-30T14:51:10  <mydog2>  my compile line is >>>   javac -classpath '/opt/selenium/lib/*:/apps/parseapp2/' stest.java
2011-05-30T14:51:37  <mydog2> and i placed the two jar files in the lib dir..
2011-05-30T14:51:42  <rpk> Yeah. that looked right, which is why I asked if you could see what was getting built into it
2011-05-30T14:52:11  <mydog2> i'm not a java guy.. i'm running some things created by another guy a while ago...
2011-05-30T14:52:14  <mydog2> simple things..
2011-05-30T14:52:40  <mydog2> but how can i see what is built into the app..
2011-05-30T14:52:43  <rpk> Ok, well you're missing commons-collections-3.2.1 apparently.  Its in libs, right?
2011-05-30T14:52:50  <rpk> mydog2: build it into a jar
2011-05-30T14:53:11  <mydog2> is that part of selenium?? or of java?
2011-05-30T14:53:12  *** Mayank has joined #selenium

2011-05-30T14:54:54  <mydog2> let me recheck.. i only saw the 2 jar files..
2011-05-30T14:55:25  <mydog2> aha... i see it .. complete missed the lis folder in the zip...
2011-05-30T14:55:30  <rpk> mydog2: you should have 25 jars in the libs
2011-05-30T14:55:37  <rpk> oh, ok
2011-05-30T14:56:06  <mydog2> right.. let me recompile..
2011-05-30T15:03:37  <mydog2> rpk    -- i screwed something up!!!  i've pasted the compil/run cmds.. as well as the test case java  --  http://fpaste.org/UWpq/
2011-05-30T15:03:49  <mydog2> i'm sure it's a simple java thing..
2011-05-30T15:03:56  <mydog2> can you take a quick look...
2011-05-30T15:04:13  <mydog2> this is pretty much what i've done with the htmlunit test cases i created.
2011-05-30T15:04:40  <mydog2> it can't find the main class "stest" .. but it's there in the stest.java file
2011-05-30T15:05:19  <rpk> first of all, drop the package declaration
2011-05-30T15:05:27  <rpk> and give me a second, I'll try and compile
2011-05-30T15:06:23  <mydog2> got it... i deleted the package and it runs...
2011-05-30T15:06:34  <mydog2> but it kicks up a copy of firefox!!!
2011-05-30T15:07:14  <mydog2> don't tell me that this is a function of selenium!! is there a way to run the test without having firefox run/be displayed??
2011-05-30T15:07:31  <rpk> yes. use htmltest
2011-05-30T15:07:44  <rpk> err, htmlunit
2011-05-30T15:07:47  <rpk> as your browser
2011-05-30T15:08:31  <mydog2> can't use htmlunit.. it seems to screw up on the javascript/cookies issue for the sites i'm targeting.. i've been fighting with that for 3-4 weeks!!!
2011-05-30T15:08:57  <rpk> then of course firefox / chrome / ie will be displayed
2011-05-30T15:09:04  <mydog2> crap...
2011-05-30T15:09:10  <rpk> can you name a gui testing framework that doesn't function that way?
2011-05-30T15:09:44  <mydog2> i was hoping sel had a way of running the instance in mem.. without displaying it..
2011-05-30T15:10:07  <rpk> why can't you have it be displayed?
2011-05-30T15:10:15  <rpk> just push it out to a vm?
2011-05-30T15:11:00  <mydog2> as in virtual monitor.. or virtual machine?

2011-05-30T15:18:37  <mydog2> my reason for looking at selenium is to see if what i'm doing will work...

2011-05-30T15:19:23  <mydog2> which has a few 100 colleges, and the associated depts/course/etc..
2011-05-30T15:19:34  <rpk> Its unfortunate that htmlunit hasn't gotten back to you, but running Selenium over RC should work if you can run it in a VM
2011-05-30T15:19:36  <mydog2> so ii have to iterate through the pages/tree to get the data..
2011-05-30T15:19:57  <rpk> mydog2: oh, is there a reason you can't run it when you're not there?
2011-05-30T15:20:11  <mydog2> rpk ??
2011-05-30T15:21:14  <rpk> well, i'm guessing is that your problem is that firefox is opening a window in your current screen?
2011-05-30T15:21:38  <rpk> Is there a reason you can't just run it while you're sleeping / off hours
2011-05-30T15:21:39  <rpk> ?
2011-05-30T15:23:01  <mydog2> for me/selenium on my test now, yeah...  but i've seen potential solutions that allow for running in a vm, or remote desktop/etc... right now i'm more concerned to see if i can put together a quick test that will rip through the 1st 3-4 pages and effectively return the data to me...
2011-05-30T15:23:41  <mydog2> my goal is to see if the actual javascript is run, with the associated header/cookies correctly handled...
2011-05-30T15:23:55  <mydog2> if that works.. i'm 50% of the way home..
2011-05-30T15:24:08  <mydog2> do you hang out here often??
2011-05-30T15:24:19  <rpk> soooo?  I'm saying running it in a VM will work just fine.  I'm not sure why the browser displaying is such a big issue then.
2011-05-30T15:25:07  <rpk> Yeah, recently my company has been evaluating the tool, and we ended up selecting it over competitors

2011-05-30T16:56:05  <mydog2> so i can just do the select, using xpath.. and then the selbyvisible..

2011-05-30T18:10:53  <mydog2> not sure if a bug is open.. but i have seen others with the same issue.
2011-05-30T18:11:28  <rpk> mydog2: i'm trying to define my firefox web driver so I can check in firefox, IE is rendering the page wrogn
2011-05-30T18:11:30  <rpk> wrong^
2011-05-30T18:11:48  <mydog2> i see....
2011-05-30T18:17:39  <rpk> mydog2: I got it working
2011-05-30T18:18:04  <mydog2> great.. so what did i miss...
2011-05-30T18:18:37  <rpk> Select state = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id("cboStateID")));      state.deselectAll();      state.selectByVisibleText("Kentucky");
2011-05-30T18:19:29  <mydog2> but it blew up on the "Select state"...
2011-05-30T18:19:42  <rpk> it doesn't for me?
2011-05-30T18:19:53  <rpk> you're probably missing the import for select?
2011-05-30T18:20:04  <rpk> it really helps to have an ide
2011-05-30T18:20:08  <mydog2> what's the import supposed to be?
2011-05-30T18:20:13  <mydog2> i don't have that..
2011-05-30T18:20:15  <rpk> import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select;
2011-05-30T18:23:53  <mydog2> is there a method to select on the val, instead of the text?
2011-05-30T18:24:24  <rpk> selectByValue
2011-05-30T18:24:28  <rpk> selectByID
2011-05-30T18:25:18  <mydog2> got it... ok.. i can search the api/methods later... ok.. i've got the page displayed in the ff window...
2011-05-30T18:25:31  <mydog2> but how do i now manipulate this page...
2011-05-30T18:25:38  *** nitin has quit IRC
2011-05-30T18:25:44  <rpk> what are you looking to do on it?
2011-05-30T18:25:52  <mydog2> let me paste what i have so far so you can play along!!
2011-05-30T18:26:04  <rpk> lol

2011-05-30T18:27:34  <mydog2> basically this page generates a list of colleges.. i want to select the louisville and then hit the link...
2011-05-30T18:28:15  <mydog2> or submit the link... it's an "<a" anchor of the form.. there's no submit btn.. but there is a hidden item for the get query for the form/action on the page
