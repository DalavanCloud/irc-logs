2011-07-24T06:51:15  <DarkRift_lp> hey, is there any plan on doing a Safari WebDriver in the near future ? I've found a partial implementation on nexus.openqa.org with google, but those classes doesn'T seem to be in the trunk of selenium ?

2011-07-24T09:14:10  <Rotham_> DarkRift_lp:  I'm not very experienced with selenium, but I think safari uses webkit for its rendering engine, and there is a headless webkit driver.

2011-07-24T10:39:38  <DarkRift_lp> Rotham_ true, but through a grid configuration with remote web drivers, I'd prefer run it through the native browser ... although I could probably use the WebkiitDriver to run it locally waiting for the real safari  driver (if it will ever be developped)
2011-07-24T10:42:04  <DarkRift_lp> I could probably run it through the selenium v1 wrapper with the SeleneseCommandExecutor tho
2011-07-24T10:43:05  <DarkRift_lp> but that won't allow me to take screenshots I think

2011-07-24T11:48:57  <njckname> I'm trying to use selenium 2 with C# but I'm new to C#. I have encountered a problem, to install the FirefoxDriver I need to "Copy all the "jar" files on to your CLASSPATH. " But isn't the CLASSPATH something JAVA exclusive? How do I do that in C#, I am confused
2011-07-24T11:49:10  *** dmachi has joined #selenium
2011-07-24T11:50:06  <AutomatedTester> njckname: you need to copy the dll files somewhere, then add references to then in the class library project
2011-07-24T11:51:47  <AutomatedTester> in side of visual studio
2011-07-24T11:54:03  <njckname> AutomatedTester: I already added the dlls I was instructed to add in the documentation but I thought in order to use the firefox webdriver I needed to use the .jars I keep reading about. I'm going to try a few things and maybe come back with a new question
2011-07-24T11:56:53  *** njckname has quit IRC
2011-07-24T11:58:01  <AutomatedTester> njckname: the jars are for java users
2011-07-24T11:58:01  <AutomatedTester> .net users just need the dlls, everything is packaged in the dlls
