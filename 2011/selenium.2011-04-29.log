2011-04-29T06:18:11  <XCulver> i can get the 2 browsers opened and log them in sperately but one eventually switches to the others cache

2011-04-29T06:19:21  <XCulver> no, i've not heard of it
2011-04-29T06:20:20  <wilhelm_> http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie-9/features/in-private
2011-04-29T06:20:46  <XCulver> ok thanks
2011-04-29T06:21:36  <XCulver> anybody been able to do this in selenium2?
2011-04-29T06:21:58  <XCulver> looks like you can fire "ctrl+shift+p"
2011-04-29T06:22:07  <XCulver> i'm guessing i can do a sendkeys within the browser to do that
2011-04-29T06:27:12  <jimevans> XCulver: you should definitely be getting multiple sessions with multiple instances of the InternetExplorerDriver.
2011-04-29T06:30:41  <skiphuffman__> We use virtual machines so that we only have one instance of IE running on a test machine at a time.
2011-04-29T06:31:29  <XCulver> looks like i am getting 2 sessions
2011-04-29T06:31:49  <XCulver> its just not performing the click when i switch back to the first driver
2011-04-29T06:31:55  <XCulver> the window is behind the 2nd one
2011-04-29T06:32:10  <XCulver> do i need to use .switchto()?
2011-04-29T06:32:43  <jimevans> ah. you may be running into a bug with click() on IE.
2011-04-29T06:32:58  <XCulver> any way around it?
2011-04-29T06:33:12  <XCulver> i can see it tries to click the link
2011-04-29T06:33:16  <XCulver> the link is highlighted
2011-04-29T06:33:35  <jimevans> i've seen issues where, if the IE window is in the background, clicks on element don't complete. you get the focus rectangle around the link, but it doesn't actually complete the click
2011-04-29T06:33:41  <XCulver> exactly
2011-04-29T06:33:51  <jimevans> i've not found a good workaround yet.
2011-04-29T06:34:11  <XCulver> is there a way to bring the window to the foreground?
2011-04-29T06:34:21  <jimevans> by the time you hit the issue, we're deep in the shared native events code
2011-04-29T06:34:47  <jimevans> you could call a windows api to do so.
2011-04-29T06:34:57  <jimevans> i *think* that would work.
2011-04-29T06:35:42  <jimevans> we could implement something like that in the ie driver itself, but one of the underlying principals of the project is "don't demand focus for UI stuff".
2011-04-29T06:35:51  <XCulver> right
2011-04-29T06:36:32  <jimevans> i've got a couple of things i could try on the c++ side, but i haven't found anything reliable yet.
2011-04-29T06:36:59  <XCulver> i'm just going to manually set the url to the link its clicking
2011-04-29T06:37:33  *** AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
2011-04-29T06:38:00  <jimevans> that would do it as a workaround. oftentimes, there's other stuff happening during the click (like javascript), that doesn't let that work correctly.
2011-04-29T06:38:15  <jimevans> in your case, it sounds like it would work though.
2011-04-29T06:38:15  *** AutomatedTester has quit IRC
2011-04-29T06:38:23  <XCulver> we'll see
2011-04-29T06:38:40  <XCulver> thanks for the info
2011-04-29T06:42:16  <XCulver> ok that worked
2011-04-29T06:42:46  <XCulver> when you say "deep in the shared native events code" is that windows/ie code or base/framework selenium2 code?
2011-04-29T06:42:51  <jimevans> XCulver: glad that got you a little further. it's still an issue.
2011-04-29T06:43:19  <jimevans> "shared native events code" is C++ code. it's shared by the IE and Firefox drivers on Windows.
2011-04-29T06:43:37  <skiphuffman__> Anyone have expertise in RC with Chrome and SSL?
2011-04-29T06:43:50  <skiphuffman__> I have a question in stack overflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5832769/how-can-i-remote-control-an-https-site-in-google-chrome-through-selenium-rc
2011-04-29T06:44:07  <jimevans> there's also native events code for firing OS-level events in linux, but that's used only by firefox at the moment.
2011-04-29T06:44:16  <skiphuffman__> Would it be useful to cut and paste the whole question over here?
2011-04-29T06:44:30  <jimevans> skiphuffman__: thanks for the link.
2011-04-29T06:44:52  <jimevans> pointing us to it should be sufficient, however, i know next to nothing about RC.
2011-04-29T06:44:59  <skiphuffman__> Ok
2011-04-29T06:46:14  <skiphuffman__> Hopefully someone else here might have a contribution.

2011-04-29T07:48:57  <RossPatterson> skiphuffman__: Have you already approached this problem as a purely-Chrome problem?  It doesn't sound like it's related to Selenium at all.  Other than that some Selenium users are used to dealing with SSL certificate problems, of course.
2011-04-29T07:49:23  <skiphuffman__> Yeah.  I have no problem running the test manually from the same vm
2011-04-29T07:49:41  <skiphuffman__> It is only a problem when the test is started from RC
2011-04-29T07:51:43  <skiphuffman__> I also have no problem running the same test, by RC, on the same vm, but a different browser.
2011-04-29T07:52:25  <skiphuffman__> And I have the same problem on a different vm, which has the same set of browsers, but a different OS. (Vista vs Win 7)
2011-04-29T07:53:19  <skiphuffman__> I am being called into a meeting

2011-04-29T08:04:56  <lawcab> i have a test that throws an exception if i run against FF4
2011-04-29T08:05:01  <lawcab> but it does not in FF3
2011-04-29T08:05:18  <lawcab> using 2.0b3 webdrivers
2011-04-29T08:05:39  <lawcab> another difference is the FF3 is I run on a remote and FF4 i run locally
2011-04-29T08:05:47  <lawcab> but i don't think that effects it
2011-04-29T08:06:13  <lawcab> any ideas

2011-04-29T12:07:41  <jarib> ok, cool
2011-04-29T12:07:56  <jarib> will be nice with more advanced interactions stuff out there as well
2011-04-29T12:12:29  <jleyba> advanced interactions isn't coming for a while :)
2011-04-29T12:13:28  <jleyba> the next version should have async script support, custom profiles, custom command flags for launching chrome
2011-04-29T12:13:44  <jleyba> and then general stability improvements / bug fixes

2011-04-29T14:36:36  <lcabal> hello there
2011-04-29T14:36:55  <lcabal> I am running selenium 2.0b3 using webdriver (firefoxdriver)
2011-04-29T14:37:35  <lcabal> I have 2 versions of ff on my machine
2011-04-29T14:37:48  <lcabal> how can i tell what firefox to run?
2011-04-29T14:38:23  <jarib> lcabal: what language?
2011-04-29T14:38:28  <lcabal> java
2011-04-29T14:40:05  <jarib> set the webdriver.firefox.bin property
2011-04-29T14:40:15  <jarib> jleyba: built from source
2011-04-29T14:41:28  <jleyba> jarib: The server should be logging to chromedriver.log
2011-04-29T14:41:33  <lcabal> jarib: do I just do that with/in my code?
2011-04-29T14:41:34  <jarib> aha
2011-04-29T14:41:53  <jleyba> And there's the --log-level=0 flag (I know, we really need a --help)
2011-04-29T14:44:17  <jarib> thanks. it may be just be the atoms are out of date (since it works in firefox)
2011-04-29T14:44:25  <jarib> i'll try that before i dig in further
2011-04-29T14:44:43  <lcabal> jarib: can you send a quick sample
2011-04-29T14:44:55  <lcabal> of setting the webdriver.firefox.bin
2011-04-29T14:45:23  <jarib> lcabal: System.setProperty("webdriver.firefox.bin", "/path/to/firefox")
2011-04-29T14:46:19  <lcabal> i do that before i do driver = new FireFoxDriver
2011-04-29T14:46:39  <jarib> exactly
2011-04-29T14:46:42  <lcabal> cool
2011-04-29T14:46:43  <lcabal> thanks
2011-04-29T14:46:46  <lcabal> I will try that out

2011-04-29T15:36:37  <jarib> jleyba: think i got it. goog.array.some() delegates to [].some.call(...) if [].some() is available natively, but that doesn't work if it's passed a NodeList
2011-04-29T15:37:00  <jleyba> What function is that in?
2011-04-29T15:37:05  <jarib> throws a TypeError: Object #<NodeList> has no method 'each'
2011-04-29T15:37:09  <jarib> in our code?
2011-04-29T15:38:06  <jarib> it's in dom.js:519 on our side and array.js:362 in closure
2011-04-29T15:39:36  <jarib> not sure what the definition of goog.array.ArrayLike is, but apparently a NodeList isn't
2011-04-29T15:39:52  <jarib> it may very well be that closure is right and the browser is wrong, of course
2011-04-29T15:44:27  <jarib> same thing with goog.array.{map,filter,every,...}

2011-04-29T16:01:05  <jleyba> ArrayLike is defined to include NodeList...guess it's not array-like enough for goog.array.some
2011-04-29T16:02:27  <jarib> it seems most NodeLists are fine, i can only reproduce in a few cases
2011-04-29T16:02:53  <jarib> almost like some NodeLists have 'each' and others don't
2011-04-29T16:04:40  <jarib> also looks like closure trunk has the ability to turn this off https://github.com/jarib/google-closure-library/blob/master/closure/goog/array/array.js#L37

2011-04-29T16:11:33  <jarib> hah, looks like the page where i'm seeing this is loading prototype.js, which redefines [].some
2011-04-29T16:11:39  <jarib> *sigh*
2011-04-29T16:12:09  <jleyba> and that's why i don't use javascript libraries that like to monkey-patch :)
2011-04-29T16:12:40  <jarib> indeed
2011-04-29T16:13:31  <jarib> so should we update closure and turn on that compiler flag, or work around this specific case?
2011-04-29T16:15:29  *** xshay has joined #selenium
2011-04-29T16:16:00  <xshay> hello, does anyone know who I can talk to about the selenium-webdriver ruby gem? I have some questions about SocketLock.
2011-04-29T16:16:05  <jleyba> not sure.  part of me feels like it's not a bug if the site under test is using a bad JS library
2011-04-29T16:16:09  <xshay> Pretty sure it's broken.
2011-04-29T16:16:37  <jleyba> we could switch to explicit array iteration, but what happens if someone overwrites Array.prototype.length?  At some point, you've got to be responsible for the code on your server :)
2011-04-29T16:20:17  <jarib> xshay: you can talk to me
2011-04-29T16:20:55  <jarib> jleyba: i agree in principle, but a lot of pages use prototype.. (it was the rails default up until recently)
2011-04-29T16:21:11  <xshay> jarib: so when running many seleniums in parallel on linux, SocketLock#can_lock? can sometimes raise  Errno::EBADF bad file descriptor
2011-04-29T16:21:35  <xshay> jarib: Why is a socket lock used rather than a file lock?
2011-04-29T16:21:48  <jleyba> I guess we should switch to explicit array iteration then
2011-04-29T16:22:00  <xshay> jarib: here is a reproducible case (on linux only, works on osx): https://gist.github.com/ec9a6d708780e951146f
2011-04-29T16:22:45  <xshay> (jarib we have a build server running 8 processes at the same time all driving a separate FF instance)
2011-04-29T16:23:28  <xshay> jarib: perhaps we could just catch EBADF as part of #can_lock?
2011-04-29T16:25:03  <jarib> hmm
2011-04-29T16:25:39  <jarib> so the reason we use a socket as mutex is to make sure we don't launch several firefoxes on the same port
2011-04-29T16:26:41  <jarib> with enough firefoxes, you'll eventually see timeouts fighting for that lock
2011-04-29T16:27:03  <jarib> i've never seen EBADFs though, feel free to try rescuing those and see if it helps
2011-04-29T16:27:24  <xshay> jarib: I will do so and report back.
2011-04-29T16:27:28  <jarib> xshay: the most robust alternative is to manage the ports yourself though
2011-04-29T16:27:46  <xshay> jarib: hmm, not sure who/what is defining the ports atm, will investigate
2011-04-29T16:28:07  <jarib> since you know up front how many firefoxes you'll run, you can just assign those ports up front (before your tests start)
2011-04-29T16:28:11  <jarib> which is what i do
2011-04-29T16:28:25  <xshay> jarib: I'm still curious ... you lock on the given port (let's say DEFAULT_PORT), then start searching for a free port above that given port
2011-04-29T16:28:34  <jarib> yes
2011-04-29T16:28:36  <xshay> jarib: so you end up taking two ports?
2011-04-29T16:29:06  <xshay> jarib: would a file lock for the first check be more robust? Less potential errors (such as EBADF) than a socket?
2011-04-29T16:29:07  <jarib> just for a moment
2011-04-29T16:29:42  <xshay> jarib: what are the advantages of using a socket to lock? (I haven't seen it before)
2011-04-29T16:29:43  <jarib> we only hold the lock until firefox has successfully launched on the found port, then release the lock
2011-04-29T16:30:36  <jarib> i'm not entirely sure about the socket vs file rationale
2011-04-29T16:30:46  *** csanchez has quit IRC
2011-04-29T16:30:49  <jarib> i just did what java does
2011-04-29T16:31:01  <jarib> the wiki says: The approach of using a socket as a mutex was chosen because it allows the same algorithm to be used by different JVMs or even languages at the same time without fear of starting multiple instances of Firefox all listening on the same port (which looks terrible, I can assure you :) The mechanism is simple enough so that most languages can be used to implement it without requiring any special libraries.
2011-04-29T16:31:23  <xshay> jarib: ah. link?

2011-04-29T16:41:51  *** anatol___ has quit IRC
2011-04-29T16:42:28  <jarib> xshay: another thing to notice, you may run out of ephemeral ports
2011-04-29T16:43:14  <jarib> if you see random connection failures while your tests run, you may want to tweak the kernel setting for that
2011-04-29T16:43:19  <jarib> also mentioned on the wiki
2011-04-29T16:43:23  <jarib> :wiki scalingwebdriver

2011-04-29T16:43:24  <selbot2_> 2: RubyBindings: Ruby bindings - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RubyBindings
2011-04-29T16:44:31  <jarib> xshay: you'll see the WebDriverPortPool class starts at 1024, which is below the default kernel range for local ports
2011-04-29T16:44:41  <xshay> jarib: right
2011-04-29T16:45:55  <jarib> so tweak /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range + /etc/sysctl.conf if that becomes an issue
2011-04-29T16:46:36  <jarib> actually, that doesn't matter for the port pool
2011-04-29T16:46:43  <jarib> but it does matter for outgoing connections from firefox
2011-04-29T16:46:54  <jarib> you actually don't want them to clash
2011-04-29T16:47:18  <jarib> so in our case, ip_local_port_range is 1280	65000
2011-04-29T16:48:01  <jarib> and then (1280-1024)=256 ports are left for the port pool.
2011-04-29T16:48:50  <jarib> then again with 8 firefoxes, it may not become a problem
