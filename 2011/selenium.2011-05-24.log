2011-05-24T01:29:01  <sburjan> afaik you are clicking on a div.
2011-05-24T01:29:18  <sburjan> you should click on a button, link, etc
2011-05-24T01:30:00  *** freynaud has quit IRC
2011-05-24T01:32:21  <kondal> xpath is correct only since I was able to click using seleniumRC
2011-05-24T01:32:30  <sburjan> something like driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[contains(@class, 'add')]//a")).click(); should work .. you must go deeper in the dom in order to get exactly to the clickable element
2011-05-24T01:32:43  <sburjan> kondal: seleniumRC has another mechanism of doing things
2011-05-24T01:34:25  <kondal> ok , thank you .. will check and let you know..

2011-05-24T06:12:17  <mario-goulart> AutomatedTester: it seems that the example at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium is missing something.
2011-05-24T06:12:34  <mario-goulart> "from time"
2011-05-24T06:12:43  <AutomatedTester> mario-goulart: its been updated in trunk
2011-05-24T06:12:47  <mario-goulart> Shouldn't it be "from time import time"?
2011-05-24T06:12:57  <AutomatedTester> mario-goulart: its correct in trunk
2011-05-24T06:13:17  <AutomatedTester> unfortunately waiting on other people for the release
2011-05-24T06:13:25  <mario-goulart> AutomatedTester: ah, ok.  Thanks.
2011-05-24T06:13:37  <mario-goulart> AutomatedTester: should I use the svn sources?
2011-05-24T06:15:26  <AutomatedTester> mario-goulart: the pypi version is fine
2011-05-24T06:15:30  <AutomatedTester> its a docs issue
2011-05-24T06:15:36  <AutomatedTester> unless you have a bug?
2011-05-24T06:16:47  <mario-goulart> I'm not sure.  I installed it via easy_install and get "ImportError: No module named keys" when trying "from selenium.common.keys import Keys".
2011-05-24T06:17:49  <mario-goulart> "from selenium import webdriver" works, though.
2011-05-24T06:18:04  <AutomatedTester> mario-goulart: so its not in that common
2011-05-24T06:18:17  * AutomatedTester should change that
2011-05-24T06:18:22  <AutomatedTester> its in the webdriver common
2011-05-24T06:18:37  <AutomatedTester> the common you are using for things that are common between Se1 and Se2
2011-05-24T06:19:08  <mario-goulart> Ah, alright.  "from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys" works, indeed.
2011-05-24T06:19:42  <mario-goulart> Sorry, I was just copying&pasting from the example code to see what I'd get.

2011-05-24T07:02:08  <jimevans> freyand: You could mimic what the IE driver C++ code does to detect IE version.
2011-05-24T07:02:27  <freyand> does that require to start IE ?
2011-05-24T07:02:56  <freyand> ideally , I 'd like to have a driver = RemoteDriver(xxx, ie);
2011-05-24T07:03:12  <jimevans> No. You can do it with a combination of registry calls and Windows API calls.
2011-05-24T07:03:18  <freyand> driver.getexecutableInfo(); returning the version etc
2011-05-24T07:03:22  <freyand> without launching IE
2011-05-24T07:03:37  <freyand> that would save a lot of time when the node register
2011-05-24T07:04:14  <jimevans> Check out BrowserFactory.cpp in the IEDriver directory.
2011-05-24T07:05:55  <jimevans> Essentially, what you do is find the location of iexplore.exe using the registry,
2011-05-24T07:07:37  <jimevans> then use the GetFileVersionInfo API (I think) to get the version from the executable resources.
2011-05-24T07:10:17  <freyand> that's what I do in twin
2011-05-24T07:10:18  <jimevans> Yeah, it's GetFileVersionInfo(), followed by VerQueryValue().

2011-05-24T07:43:09  <stoney_001> it isn't unfortunately
2011-05-24T07:43:37  <adamgoucher> you need the mouseUp as well
2011-05-24T07:43:50  <tcarpentier> a little question about testing with selenium, some times we do the assert method to check the result in the page source. And if it's false, the traceback raises an assertion error like :  assert "Hello my name is Thomas" in self.browser.page_source AssertionError..... But there is a way to have in the assertion error, the expected result and the actual result ? e.g : here the expected result must be "Hello i'm Thomas CARPENTI
2011-05-24T07:45:15  <adamgoucher> thats technically a runner problem, so you could create a custom assert that will respond with the message you want
2011-05-24T07:45:38  <stoney_001> no joy with mouseDown | link='some text'    followed by mouseUp | link='some text'

2011-05-24T07:46:02  <stoney_001> but if I were to do a runScriptAndWait | (copy of the javascript from the a href)   it works
2011-05-24T07:46:31  <adamgoucher> and thats not an acceptable soluon?
2011-05-24T07:47:05  <tcarpentier> adamgoucher: ok, i will take a look for create a custom assert

2011-05-24T12:07:57  <rpk> Hello, I was wondering as to why SE grid has no (web interface / way to view results / way to easily launch tests runs / database storage for results).  Is there a particular reason why it lacks this kind of support, and is there any plan to add it in the future?
2011-05-24T12:10:17  <AutomatedTester> rpk: because its an infrastructure tool
2011-05-24T12:10:24  <AutomatedTester> not a testing solution
2011-05-24T12:11:08  <rpk> Is there a testing solution I should be looking at instead then?  I haven't seen a mature product associated with selenium providing this kind of functionality?
2011-05-24T12:12:27  <rpk> Its nice to provide the infrastructure to run tests in parallel on a cluster of machines, but I'm not really sure how tests suites are intended to be run by testers.

2011-05-24T12:13:59  <ivog> rpk can't u start your testsuites from a buildserver?
2011-05-24T12:14:38  <rpk> ivog: yes, which works for our continuous integration builds, but doesn't allow testers to address issues in between builds
2011-05-24T12:15:17  <rpk> ivog: due to the size of our builds, we can only build once during the day, and have builds before works starts, and starting at 6 when people begin to leave
2011-05-24T12:16:06  <ivog> and in between testers need to run specific suites on existing builds?
2011-05-24T12:17:01  <rpk> ivog: Yes, as developers fix issues they'll deploy new partial (local) builds and testers will validate fixes
2011-05-24T12:18:09  <rpk> So if Se grid is intended to be entirely run through automation, is there an easy way to get test results out of the system?  (we anticipate a couple hundred tests that are around 20-40 steps each
2011-05-24T12:18:49  <rpk> ) ivog^
2011-05-24T12:19:02  <jarib> rpk: grid only takes care of the idea of "browser slaves" - it doesn't actually run your tests
2011-05-24T12:19:03  <ivog> so i run all grid tests in a buildserver and the buildserver collects the data
2011-05-24T12:19:53  <rpk> jarib, ivog: wouldn't distributing the tests from one central location like that slow down test execution?
2011-05-24T12:19:54  <jarib> e.g. your tests (i.e. where results are collected) still run on on a single machine, which calls out to grid, which then calls out to the browsers
2011-05-24T12:20:21  <jarib> maybe
2011-05-24T12:20:29  <jarib> but the main cost is still the actual browsers
2011-05-24T12:20:41  <ivog> if your worried about that you need to have your buildserver direct different suites to different grids
2011-05-24T12:20:48  <jarib> not the test execution
2011-05-24T12:21:04  <ivog> or different buildagents

Now, on my RC on another machine, do I run "java -jar selenium-server.jar -port 3000", and then on my hub machine, have another window with "ant launch-hub ...." ?
2011-05-24T12:27:20  <ivog> Eol: are you starting out with grid?
2011-05-24T12:28:02  <Eol> No
2011-05-24T12:31:53  <Eol> Just confused as to whether or not I need to install the selenium-grid.jar on each remote control, or is the selenium-server.jar good enough for my remotes
2011-05-24T12:33:17  <ivog> i think you need a grid specific jar but im not sure
2011-05-24T12:33:49  <ivog> i think the selenium-server.jar doesn't support the -hubUrl parameter but i can be wrong

2011-05-24T12:40:20  <lisak> because i simply exists, but htmlunitdriver can't find it ...wtf

2011-05-24T12:45:06  <rpk> Also, I'd appreciate if someone could clarify a few more things for me: Someone listed: "Uses DOM manipulation at execution time" as a con, is this still the case with Se 2.0 and webdriver?

2011-05-24T12:54:37  <ivog> webdriver uses native browser apis to control the different browsers
2011-05-24T12:55:31  <ivog> i guess you can still 'manipulate the dom at execution time' but i doubt that is much a of con
2011-05-24T12:56:42  <Eol> I assume the "con" is that it is slow

2011-05-24T13:10:21  <lisak> ivog, the url is correct, so that maybe the reason why htmlunitDriver can't find it and chromeDriver can't click is that its opacity is 0

2011-05-24T13:26:08  <rpk> Hey, sorry I couldn't reply above, I got called away.  But yeah, I think the con was that it was slow, but I had thought webdriver would make that point irrelevant.  Anyways, I guess my last question is, if Se 2.0 uses browser native APIs, will I not be able to write a test once, and then run it on different browsers?

2011-05-24T13:28:36  <rpk> That would require 3x the number of tests in order to just ensure functionality on IE, FF, and Chrome.  Is there something that prevents common calls from being abstracted away, or are they already and only edge cases will require the tests to be tailored to the browser?
2011-05-24T13:29:14  <ivog> rpk: no webdriver has a api which underneath uses different native browser apis
2011-05-24T13:29:29  <ivog> but you only have to deal with one api for all browsers

2011-05-24T16:23:19  <eranm> Not necessarily (there's no enforcement of this matching) but generally, it's best to try with the exact same version.
2011-05-24T16:23:36  <eranm> I'm told a new version of the chromedriver binary is supposed to be made available today
2011-05-24T16:24:33  <lisak> eranm, is it gonna be on the webdriver's download site ?
2011-05-24T16:24:41  <eranm> Yes
2011-05-24T16:24:52  <lisak> great, thank you
2011-05-24T16:25:31  <eranm> I'd appreciate if you can dig further and see if you can get any output from chromedriver, perhaps it reports anything interesting
2011-05-24T16:25:50  <lisak> from the Java binding one ?
2011-05-24T16:26:00  <lisak> or the native one
2011-05-24T16:26:36  <lisak> I don't have any idea how to get anything from the chromedriver server :)
2011-05-24T16:28:19  <eranm> That'd require digging into the ChromeDriverService.
2011-05-24T16:29:05  <eranm> I'm asking the ChromeDriver developer about it now, let's see what he has to say.
2011-05-24T16:30:53  <jarib> lisak: sounds like the server isn't launching successfully; you could try to launch `chromedriver` manually from the command line and use RemoteWebDriver to connect to http://localhost:9515
2011-05-24T16:30:58  <jarib> that's basically what ChromeDriver does
2011-05-24T16:31:18  <jarib> but if you do it manually you can easily see the output from the server, whether it crashes on launch etc.
2011-05-24T16:34:50  <jarib> eranm: #1 feature request of you're talking to them: ability to shut down the server and but leave the browser(s) running

2011-05-24T16:38:56  <jarib> eranm: not that i know of. i think jason told me they were tracking most of the chromedriver stuff internally
2011-05-24T16:39:10  <jarib> (and that he wanted to move it to the google code tracker)
2011-05-24T16:39:35  <jarib> i'd be happy to file it if that helps
2011-05-24T16:40:07  <lisak> any idea what to do with that ?
2011-05-24T16:40:54  <jarib> lisak: i'd be surprised if the chromedriver server has dependencies that are not in chrome itself
2011-05-24T16:41:04  <jarib> lisak: you can launch chrome successfully, right?
2011-05-24T16:41:05  <lisak> jarib, it is not missing
2011-05-24T16:41:09  <lisak> it can't be open
2011-05-24T16:41:12  <lisak> yep
2011-05-24T16:41:43  <jarib> ah, right
2011-05-24T16:41:49  <lisak> don't know what is that cannot open shared object file: Error 40
2011-05-24T16:41:57  <lisak> it has the lib from chrome
2011-05-24T16:42:06  <jarib> not sure what Error 40 is
2011-05-24T16:42:27  <lisak> but it should be probably something with the version difference
2011-05-24T16:45:36  <eranm> lisak: can you paste the error?
2011-05-24T16:47:10  <jarib> lisak: i see some people suggesting "error 40" means ELOOP, "too many symbolic links encountered"

2011-05-24T16:48:22  <lisak> first off it couldn't find it
