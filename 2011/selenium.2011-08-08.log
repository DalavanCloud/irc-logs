2011-08-08T01:21:22  <simonstewart> Also reports of it working perfectly also appreicated
2011-08-08T01:21:26  <gordolio> I'm actually trying to get it running using perl.
2011-08-08T01:21:28  <simonstewart> andreashaas: love that song
2011-08-08T01:22:15  <gordolio> is it meant to implement the entire JsonWireProtocol?
2011-08-08T01:22:29  <simonstewart> Not all of it yet
2011-08-08T01:22:45  <gordolio> ok.
2011-08-08T01:24:33  <gordolio> I'll play around with it some more... but it appears to use a different path than the selenium-server-standalone jar.
2011-08-08T01:24:39  <gordolio> and it's running on a different port.
2011-08-08T01:24:41  <simonstewart> Yes
2011-08-08T01:24:45  <simonstewart> It's written in objc
2011-08-08T01:24:54  <gordolio> yes.
2011-08-08T01:25:08  <simonstewart> The main thing is has in common is the wire protocol and the use of the underlying automation atoms

2011-08-08T01:29:21  <gordolio> ok, I'm looking at the ruby implementation...  I think I understand now... just changing the port and the default path looks like all I'd have to do.
2011-08-08T01:29:29  <simonstewart> jarib_: hopefully.

2011-08-08T01:30:33  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: it's been rewritten (again)
2011-08-08T01:30:42  <simonstewart> It handles non breaking spaces properly now
2011-08-08T01:30:46  <AutomatedTester> right
2011-08-08T01:31:04  <AutomatedTester> we really need a mechanism for communicating this out :/
2011-08-08T01:31:11  <simonstewart> "tests"?
2011-08-08T01:31:25  <AutomatedTester> my tests break, so is it the test or the code?

2011-08-08T01:34:41  <simonstewart> Checking now
2011-08-08T01:34:56  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, I initiate a ie driver like this :self.driver = webdriver.Ie(), and do this: driver.get("http://www.google.com/")
2011-08-08T01:34:56  <Glynnis>         driver.find_element_by_id("lst-ib").click()

2011-08-08T01:37:35  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, yeah,same scripts works for firefox
2011-08-08T01:37:58  <AutomatedTester> hmmm, that sounds like an issue with the IE driver rather than the python code
2011-08-08T01:38:24  <AutomatedTester> Glynnis: can you create a cut down test that isn't reliant of Google.com?
2011-08-08T01:38:34  <AutomatedTester> unfortunately google will try do redirects etc
2011-08-08T01:38:42  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, ok,let me try
2011-08-08T01:39:03  <simonstewart> Ajay_: Hopefully, but the IE driver has a blocker
2011-08-08T01:39:07  <simonstewart> In that it doesn't compile
2011-08-08T01:39:17  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, do I need to download a separate IE driver except for install python bindings ?
2011-08-08T01:39:36  <AutomatedTester> the IEDriver is bundled with the python stuff
2011-08-08T01:39:39  <simonstewart> I need to sit down and get my C++ foo on the case

2011-08-08T02:34:16  <simonstewart> We really shouldn't be collapsing them as normal spaces

2011-08-08T02:34:36  <simonstewart> space nbsp space should end up as "space space space"

2011-08-08T05:43:07  <pngl> General question: a number of my tests are brittle - errors pop up every so often, too rare to be seriously tracked up, but frequent enough to remove any confidence that a failed test run means an actual problem in the application code. Does anyone else have this problem?

2011-08-08T05:44:15  <pngl> By the way I don't use sleep and there are a few retries on every failure, but the number of OS/Browsers combinations guarantees that I'll see some new error every batch of run (I test on Windows Vista and 7, with IE7, 9, Firefox 3)

2011-08-08T05:59:32  <RossPatterson> It's taken a lot of study, but we've learned that we occasionally write a brittle test - one that fails unpredictably.
2011-08-08T05:59:54  <RossPatterson> It's *always* a timing problem of some sort.
2011-08-08T06:00:20  <RossPatterson> (Except for browser-specific issues, which still do exist, even in 2011.)
2011-08-08T06:01:30  <RossPatterson> We deal with it by quarantining them while trying to understand their weaknesses, then repairing them and insisting on a month or so of health before releasing them back into the wild.
2011-08-08T06:01:48  <RossPatterson> It's kinda like running a wild-animal clinic :-)
2011-08-08T06:04:09  <pngl> RossPatterson: what do you mean by releasing into the wild? run the test only in the staging area and then on production after a few months?
2011-08-08T06:04:23  <RossPatterson> Right now, we have 1,045 tests that are reliable, spread across 15 jobs in TeamCity, and 164 tests in the quarantine job.  About half of the quarantined tests have been passing for the last few weeks - it's about time to move them back into the reliable group.
2011-08-08T06:05:39  <barancev|2> another issue: go test_ie failed in testShouldAllowUsersToAcceptAnAlertWithNoTextManually with an error message "Could not find text"
2011-08-08T06:05:52  <RossPatterson> No, we run all the tests on exactly the same code-base.  But we separate the runs, so we expect the quarantine job to always fail, and we treat failures in the reliable group as a serious problem.
2011-08-08T06:05:53  <barancev|2> alert is here, I can see it, but selenium cannot

2011-08-08T06:17:45  <jimevans> that would explain why i haven't seen the problem.
2011-08-08T06:18:34  <simonstewart> sorry jimevans
2011-08-08T06:18:36  <jimevans> nevertheless, i don't see why that would be so. i'd have to investigate further.
2011-08-08T06:18:53  <jimevans> simonstewart: for what?
2011-08-08T06:19:10  <simonstewart> The atoms have ticked past a certain size
2011-08-08T06:19:17  <simonstewart> So VS now gets upset when compiling them
2011-08-08T06:19:24  <simonstewart> Was debating a couple of routes
2011-08-08T06:19:31  <simonstewart> Wondered if you had a preference

2011-08-08T06:19:45  <simonstewart> resources have been mentioned as one solution
2011-08-08T06:19:54  <jimevans> i think i mentioned that one.
2011-08-08T06:20:02  <simonstewart> The other than springs to mind would be to break each atom into an array of wchar_ts
2011-08-08T06:20:07  <simonstewart> that's null terminated
2011-08-08T06:20:10  <simonstewart> And just loop to build
2011-08-08T06:20:33  <simonstewart> Got a preference?
2011-08-08T06:20:35  <jimevans> we used to break them into an array of strings, one string to a line.
2011-08-08T06:20:40  <simonstewart> right
2011-08-08T06:20:50  <simonstewart> And I'm wondering whether we should go back to that?
2011-08-08T06:20:53  <jimevans> lemme think a minute.
2011-08-08T06:21:00  <simonstewart> sure
2011-08-08T06:21:48  <jimevans> resources are sort of the "right" way to handle this, i think, and would also let us be able to properly version the ie native code dlls, but...
2011-08-08T06:22:11  <jimevans> it would probably change our build process
2011-08-08T06:22:22  <simonstewart> Quite possibly
2011-08-08T06:22:24  <barancev|2> oh, I was wrong, there are two more failed tests in AlertsTest -- testSettingTheValueOfAnAlertThrows and testSwitchingToMissingAlertThrows
2011-08-08T06:22:30  <simonstewart> But we've changed the build process before
2011-08-08T06:23:58  <jimevans> simonstewart: true that.
2011-08-08T06:24:32  <simonstewart> Happy either way

2011-08-08T08:42:21  <XRayCulver> do you do multiple find elements? or create a xpath/css locator dynamically and use that?
2011-08-08T08:43:31  <andytinkham> XRayCulver: I'd probably try the dynamic creation path first, but that's just me (and I haven't done much of that yet)

2011-08-08T08:45:29  <nirvdrum> AutomatedTester: Anyway, the way EC 2 works, you need to start an instance with the security groups you want applied.  That set is immutable: you can't add or remove groups to an existing instance.  But you can modify the group definition.

2011-08-08T08:59:22  <jimevans> andytinkham: hmm... that's awfully strange, then.
2011-08-08T08:59:58  <jimevans> the actual code launching IE isn't really anything special.
2011-08-08T09:00:14  <andytinkham> jimevans: I can gist the stack trace if it would help - looks like it's in read_status_line and then dropping into protocol.rb
2011-08-08T09:00:34  <jimevans> it sounds like the mongoose http server isn't getting started correctly.
2011-08-08T09:01:13  <andytinkham> jimevans: Possibly related (but not confirmed) - when I started getting the Timeout errors again after rebooting, I had an IE instance up from a previous run

2011-08-08T09:01:47  <jimevans> I'm not a Ruby guy, but I suspect the timeout error you're receiving is that the HTTP request to the mongoose web server is timing out.
2011-08-08T09:02:11  <jarib> yep
2011-08-08T09:02:24  <jarib> most likely (the backtrace would tell for sure)
2011-08-08T09:03:08  <andytinkham> jarib, jimevans: Back trace: https://gist.github.com/1132069
2011-08-08T09:04:10  <jarib> yep, it's hanging on the create_session command

2011-08-08T09:04:45  <andytinkham> Does Mongoose show up in the task manager or something like that?
2011-08-08T09:04:59  <jimevans> no, it's not a separate process.
2011-08-08T09:05:16  <jimevans> (though longer-term, we should create an IEDriver.exe, much like the chromedriver.exe)

2011-08-08T09:06:31  <andytinkham> So, is it likely that something (virus scan, VPN, something like that) is interfering with it on our machines, or are there other things I should look at?
2011-08-08T09:07:04  <jimevans> firewall, maybe? i'm drawing something of a blank at the moment.
2011-08-08T09:08:02  <andytinkham> Hmmm, Windows Firewall is turned on at the moment here, but I don't think the setting's changed between working and timeouts
2011-08-08T09:08:03  <jimevans> the .NET bindings give you the option to start the IE driver listening on a specific port. How do the Ruby bindings handle the port issue?
2011-08-08T09:08:30  <jimevans> (hard-coded, random port, or is there an option)
2011-08-08T09:09:25  <jimevans> some bindings choose a random port, which could possibly cause problems with a firewall.
2011-08-08T09:10:11  <XRayCulver> ohh, so if you create a seperate IEdriver.exe, we can debug in visualstudio again?
2011-08-08T09:10:18  <andytinkham> I turned off the firewall, and I'm still getting timeout errors
2011-08-08T09:10:34  <jimevans> XRayCulver: that would be one side-effect, yes.

2011-08-08T09:11:56  <jimevans> yeah, i'm grasping at straws.
2011-08-08T09:12:48  <jimevans> i suspect what's happening is that for some reason, we're unable to launch IE, but not correctly interpreting the error code from the API that starts it.
2011-08-08T09:12:58  <lukeis> XRayCulver: yep (somewhat... real work today mostly)
2011-08-08T09:13:12  <jimevans> Then we're waiting for the process to exist, and it never does, so we never respond to the HTTP request.
2011-08-08T09:14:21  <jimevans> I can tell you how we try to locate and launch IE, but I don't know if it would help.
2011-08-08T09:15:05  <andytinkham> More information might be worth it... At the moment, I understand what you're saying but have no idea what to look for to see if it is the case or if there's a workaround (other than use Firefox)

2011-08-08T09:16:54  <lukeis> the second one was jQuery attaching an event listener, it worked when I specified the "onchange" attribute on the select node directly
2011-08-08T09:16:59  <jimevans> andytinkham: so, in my view there are two possibilities for what's not working.
2011-08-08T09:17:22  <jimevans> the first is that the mongoose server never interprets the command to create a new session.
2011-08-08T09:17:23  <jarib> jimevans, andytinkham: ruby uses default port 5555, can be overridden (unless the server is already running in the same process)
2011-08-08T09:17:34  <XRayCulver> i'm thinking that should be noted in the issue?
2011-08-08T09:17:53  <jimevans> the second is that it tries to launch IE, but IE never appears.
2011-08-08T09:18:46  <lukeis> XRayCulver: sure, i'll add a comment
2011-08-08T09:19:01  <XRayCulver> alright, thanks!
2011-08-08T09:19:06  <jimevans> there are two different ways we try to launch IE, and it's version and OS dependent. what's your environment?
2011-08-08T09:20:08  <jimevans> (oh, and i hate jquery)
2011-08-08T09:20:22  <jimevans> (just sayin')
2011-08-08T09:21:21  <jimevans> simonstewart: after your atoms changes, the IE tests run, yes?
2011-08-08T09:21:34  <simonstewart> yes
2011-08-08T09:21:38  <jimevans> groovy.
2011-08-08T09:21:53  *** Spanktar has joined #selenium
2011-08-08T09:22:43  <lukeis> jimevans: you prefer something else than jquery? should I have that sample updated to prototype or yui or dojo or ...? :)
2011-08-08T09:23:36  <lukeis> maybe strip it down to raw js and see if that reproduces it... (ugh, real work... maybe tomorrow)
2011-08-08T09:23:53  <jimevans> lukeis: i'm pretty sure the problem is jquery-specific. jquery doesn't trigger it's "change" event when you manually fire the HTML onchange event of the select element.
2011-08-08T09:24:24  <lukeis> ah
2011-08-08T09:24:33  <simonstewart> Wow. there was a spectacular amount of fail in that compilation
2011-08-08T09:26:26  <Archdude> hey guys - what's the command to change the number maximum concurrent tests when starting an RC node?

2011-08-08T09:32:05  <jimevans> andytinkham: okay, then we should be using the IELaunchURL Windows API function to start IE, so it's likely not a registry thing.
2011-08-08T09:33:13  <jimevans> and in that case, we should be getting a process ID for the launched IE process, unless the API call is hanging.
2011-08-08T09:34:09  <andytinkham> jarib, jimevans: netstat -a doesn't show anything using port 5555 right now
2011-08-08T09:35:08  <andytinkham> jimevans: Does that process ID get logged somewhere?
2011-08-08T09:35:10  <jimevans> yeah, the intermittent nature of the problem (it works, then stops working) looks more and more to me like a mongoose problem.

2011-08-08T09:36:23  <jimevans> i've got a couple of medium-sized non-functional changes to the ie driver native code that i need to get done to make this kind of thing easier.
2011-08-08T09:37:01  <jimevans> back in a few minutes.
2011-08-08T09:37:04  <andytinkham> Can I install a different version of mongoose somewhere that might provide a work around?
2011-08-08T09:37:40  *** vrockai_ has quit IRC
2011-08-08T09:37:42  <jimevans> don't think of mongoose as a separate library you can update. it's statically compiled into the IE driver native code.
2011-08-08T09:37:56  <andytinkham> OK, so no on that route then :)
2011-08-08T09:38:21  * adamgoucher just doesn't know enough about js's handling of escaped characters to debug this
2011-08-08T09:38:39  <dawagner> jimevans: What's the difference between build/cli and build/dotnet? I can't actually see anything that should cause the build/cli directory to be created, but it is...
2011-08-08T09:39:18  <dawagner> Also, why does :test_dotnet on run the firefox tests?
2011-08-08T09:39:32  <jimevans> build/cli is the debugging/build through the Visual Studio IDE directory.
2011-08-08T09:39:54  <jimevans> because building through the IDE can't embed the native code resources properly.
2011-08-08T09:40:03  <dawagner> ok, makes sense :)
2011-08-08T09:40:25  <jimevans> i don't use :test_dotnet. never really done much to maintain that target.
2011-08-08T09:40:38  <jimevans> feel free to change.
2011-08-08T09:41:01  <dawagner> What do you use to actually run the tests?
2011-08-08T09:41:19  <jimevans> go //dotnet/test:<browser>:run
2011-08-08T09:41:29  <dawagner> Ok :)

2011-08-08T10:43:04  <adamgoucher> likely no one here uses -htmlsuite as it means you are using se-ide for more than just quick bug reproduction. and anything more than that should be in something like webdriver. which means you need to wait until someone has a moment to see if it can be reproduced
2011-08-08T10:44:02  <lord1234> so, question
2011-08-08T10:44:18  <lord1234> here's a hypotehsis(and I don't use ID so i don't know) do you have write permissions to the directory where the html suites are written?
2011-08-08T10:44:44  <jarib> if it generates a zero byte file, that's not the problem
2011-08-08T10:44:58  <lord1234> truue

2011-08-08T11:06:55  <selenium> yes you are right, I use IDE to generate the script
2011-08-08T11:07:04  <selenium> and add verify/assertion

2011-08-08T11:10:26  <dawagner> jimevans: Hi
2011-08-08T11:11:03  <jimevans> i need to understand the CookieImplementationTest class in java. Specifically, under what conditions should those tests actually run?
2011-08-08T11:12:10  <dawagner> jimevans: At least, they need a hostname which is not localhost or an IP address
2011-08-08T11:12:37  *** dreuxl has joined #selenium
2011-08-08T11:12:41  <jimevans> i see. and in the normal course of the java tests, we accomplish this how?
2011-08-08T11:12:55  <dawagner> For a few of them (which test that .x.y is visible on z.x.y, and similar) need subdomains set up as well
2011-08-08T11:13:02  <jimevans> right. i see that.

2011-08-08T11:13:48  <jimevans> aha. that's where i need to look, then i guess.
2011-08-08T11:13:53  <dawagner> At the moment we grab the first one, and if it's not useful, we skip the tests
2011-08-08T11:14:41  <dawagner> Fixing that stuff up better is somewhere on my to do list... Somewhere...
2011-08-08T11:15:24  <jimevans> i can see us running the tests in java, which means we must be getting a non-localhost, non-ip address host name, but i don't see where that happens.
2011-08-08T11:16:09  <dawagner> What do you mean by "i can see us"?
2011-08-08T11:16:19  <jimevans> i can see the tests running
2011-08-08T11:16:32  <dawagner> The way they're not run is that they all have effective an "if (not suitable), return;" clause at the top of them
2011-08-08T11:16:55  <jimevans> right. my question is: where do we get the host name?
2011-08-08T11:17:10  <jimevans> on my machine, it's clear we're getting a non-localhost, non-ip address host name.

2011-08-08T11:24:42  <selenium> :-(
2011-08-08T11:25:24  <jimevans> selenium: you've got to be more patient. you waited literally less than 5 seconds before asking again, and less than 30 before expressing your displeasure at not getting a response.
2011-08-08T11:25:36  <selenium> sorry
2011-08-08T11:26:24  <jimevans> that said, I would bet that not many people here use selenese/IDE for full-blown functional testing.
2011-08-08T11:26:29  <lord1234> selenium: lets have a different discussion
2011-08-08T11:26:32  <lord1234> why do you use selenese?
2011-08-08T11:26:38  <lord1234> might be much more beneficial to you.

2011-08-08T11:40:04  <andytinkham1> Is there some obvious reason why this XPath works in Firefox and not in IE? //button[contains(span, "New Patient")]
2011-08-08T11:40:48  <AutomatedTester> andytinkham1: stupid question: is the HTML the same in both/
2011-08-08T11:41:01  <jimevans> no obvious reason, but remember that the XPath engine in IE is javascript
2011-08-08T11:41:06  <andytinkham1> AutomatedTester: Good question. Let me check :)
2011-08-08T11:42:31  <andytinkham1> jimevans: What implications does that have (other than it could parse the xpath completely differently)?
2011-08-08T11:42:39  <dawagner> Kudos Mozilla - Firefox 5 installs on my fresh XP no-SP machine, Chrome needs SP2
2011-08-08T11:43:10  <AutomatedTester> dawagner: thats because 30% of the world is on that version of XP...

2011-08-08T11:43:47  <RossPatterson> andytinkham1: I've never see that "contains(element-name, ...)" used in Selenium.  I'd write that as "//button[/span[contains(text(), 'New Patient')]]".
2011-08-08T11:44:32  <andytinkham1> AutomatedTester: Hmmm, IE doesn't want to give up the source code of the button in question. Need to dig further.
2011-08-08T11:44:38  <andytinkham1> jimevans:  OK, will keep that in mind
2011-08-08T11:44:38  <Archdude> i use contains
2011-08-08T11:45:09  <andytinkham1> RossPatterson: I was a little surprised this syntax worked when I was originally developing (in Firefox). Will try that revised version.

2011-08-08T11:55:26  <jarib> lord1234: if you're going to be starting/stopping the server from ruby anyway, you don't really need rake
2011-08-08T11:55:38  <jarib> look at the Selenium::Server class
2011-08-08T11:55:40  <lord1234> jarib, i tried doing it other ways, and had no success
2011-08-08T11:55:46  <lord1234> ok
2011-08-08T11:55:56  <jarib> the rake task uses Selenium::Server under the hood.

2011-08-08T12:55:59  <andytinkham1> lord1234: I think I missed it
2011-08-08T12:56:21  <lord1234> try: //span[text()="New Patient"]
2011-08-08T12:56:40  <andytinkham1> lord1234: Yeah, did miss that. Sorry about that. Will try it too
2011-08-08T12:57:38  <andytinkham1> (again once the timeout errors go away - I seem to have to let the machine sit for a while without running IE tests (or having IE open) to get things working again. If I run a test with IE open, I go back to having timeout errors.))
2011-08-08T12:58:21  <andytinkham1> Not sure why I put the //button in there, unless I was trying to highlight that it was really a button for some reason
2011-08-08T12:59:09  <andytinkham1> FirePath does indicate that just going off the span is still unique, so it *should* work
2011-08-08T13:01:10  <AutomatedTester> nirvdrum: do you know how to associate naked domain to a single EC2 instance?
2011-08-08T13:01:17  <jimevans> andytinkham1: is the driver getting shut down properly? that symptom sounds suspiciously like a port already in use.
2011-08-08T13:01:25  <lord1234> ok now i think i fucked something up

2011-08-08T13:03:05  <andytinkham1> Looks like it would call @driver.quit, except that line is commented out. So, I'm just closing IE manually (I think this is a side effect of a mistaken check-in)
2011-08-08T13:03:21  <nirvdrum> AutomatedTester: I don't use Route 53, so I can't weigh in on that.  But generally you just set up the A record to point at the public IP.  You almost certainly want to get an elastic IP for that instance though.
2011-08-08T13:03:41  <nirvdrum> An elastic IP is basically a static IP associated with an instance.
2011-08-08T13:03:47  <lord1234> oh boy i'd realllly love if jarib came back

2011-08-08T13:05:25  <andytinkham1> Because I didn't look closely and simply pared down the one I had. SOrry. My bad
2011-08-08T13:05:27  <nirvdrum> AutomatedTester: I could be mistaken, but I think you only pay for an elastic IP if you don't have it attached to a running instance.
2011-08-08T13:05:49  <AutomatedTester> nirvdrum: i may have misread it
2011-08-08T13:05:51  <nirvdrum> So, if the server is up, you don't pay anything extra for the IP.
2011-08-08T13:06:03  <nirvdrum> $0.01 per non-attached Elastic IP address per complete hour

2011-08-08T13:11:20  <andytinkham1> lord1234: OK, once I got all the typos out, that xpath works in FF. Now to try IE (since hopefully my timeout errors have gone away (and jimevans: Now I've re-enabled the driver.quit call to make sure things close out correctly).

2011-08-08T13:14:28  <andytinkham1> lord1234: Are you missing a require statement? Sounds like your code doesn't know about the SeleniumDriver class yet. What's the context where you're getting the error?

2011-08-08T13:16:59  <nirvdrum> AutomatedTester: Glad to hear.  One thing I found nice about AWS is that it basically forces you to automate and build in fault tolerance, because things can disappear at any given time.
2011-08-08T13:17:11  <nirvdrum> You have the same risk with real hardware, but it's not as pronounced.
2011-08-08T13:17:38  <andytinkham1> lord1234: Your revised XPath works - I get further at least. Thanks!
2011-08-08T13:18:04  <lord1234> jarib, well i've basically reverted, something wasn't working right
2011-08-08T13:18:09  <lord1234> i'm trying to figure out wtf i did wrong

2011-08-08T13:18:24  <lord1234> lol
2011-08-08T13:18:44  <jarib_> you were mixing two selenium gems together

2011-08-08T13:21:24  <Parabola> hey guys :)
2011-08-08T13:21:32  <Parabola> i'm trying to use chrome driver on linux, and having some issues
2011-08-08T13:21:52  <Parabola> 1st, the binary file is in the expected path (/usr/bin/google-chrome) i set the system property, and chrome launches, but nothing happens
2011-08-08T13:22:00  <Parabola> after my 30 sec timeout, it says "Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Timed out waiting for ChromeDriver server to start."
2011-08-08T13:22:11  <Parabola> is this expected behaviour
2011-08-08T13:22:20  <jarib_> can you start chromedriver manually?
2011-08-08T13:22:31  <Parabola> i have no idea
2011-08-08T13:22:34  <Parabola> how do i do that
2011-08-08T13:22:47  <Parabola> sorry, doing this in java, if that matters
2011-08-08T13:22:48  <jarib_> type "chromedriver" in a shell
2011-08-08T13:23:09  <jarib_> assuming you've added the executable to your PATH
2011-08-08T13:23:19  <Parabola> i have a single jar file..
2011-08-08T13:23:19  <jarib_> otherwise use the full path
2011-08-08T13:23:51  <Parabola> using selenium2
2011-08-08T13:24:20  <jarib_> for chrome, you need a standalone executable as well
2011-08-08T13:24:38  <Parabola> sorry yeah maven did import the chrome-driver jar
2011-08-08T13:24:45  <jarib_> if it's not there, you'll get an exception with a download url
2011-08-08T13:25:01  <jarib_> it's not a jar, it's an executable file
2011-08-08T13:25:40  <jarib_> if chrome launches, that's a good indication it's there

2011-08-08T13:30:44  <jarib_> what property did you set?
2011-08-08T13:31:45  <jarib_> sounds like you've set webdriver.chrome.driver to the actual chrome binary, instead of the chromedriver executable
2011-08-08T13:31:54  <Parabola> right
2011-08-08T13:32:01  <lukeis> yuck... fixing chapter 3 for chrome now...
2011-08-08T13:32:04  <Parabola> beacuse the wiki says point at the chrome executable
2011-08-08T13:32:10  <jarib_> that's your problem then
2011-08-08T13:32:36  <Parabola> okay
2011-08-08T13:32:39  <Parabola> my next question is
2011-08-08T13:32:44  <Parabola> what the hell do you want me to download
2011-08-08T13:32:50  <Parabola> the download page linked doesnt have a chrome download

2011-08-08T13:34:53  <Parabola> yes sir
2011-08-08T13:35:48  <jimevans> I'm not sure the wiki makes this clear, but the people in the best position to know how to automate any particular browser is the browser manufacturer.
2011-08-08T13:36:14  <Parabola> not to be rude, but thats 110% unhelpful
2011-08-08T13:36:18  <jimevans> So the low-level code that drives Chrome, in particular, is now maintained by the Chromium team.
2011-08-08T13:36:20  <Parabola> i cant call google and ask how to automate this
2011-08-08T13:36:28  <Parabola> they dont care at all and arent going to help me

2011-08-08T13:37:51  <lukeis> (zip files)
2011-08-08T13:37:54  <jimevans> So there's now some code used to drive Chrome that's owned by the Chromium team, and that's why you download it from the Chromium downloads site.
2011-08-08T13:38:08  <jimevans> It's in addition to the Selenium .jar you already have.
2011-08-08T13:38:41  <Parabola> great
2011-08-08T13:38:48  <jimevans> I'm trying to explain why it's not on the Selenium site, and why you'd need to "go download something else"
2011-08-08T13:40:19  <Parabola> i understand thank you
2011-08-08T13:40:39  <Parabola> so with FF you're able to install an extension
2011-08-08T13:40:46  <Parabola> why is this not possible with chrome
2011-08-08T13:41:41  <jimevans> I'm not sure I understand the question. Install an extension in Firefox for what, exactly?

2011-08-08T14:05:37  <jarib> aha
2011-08-08T14:06:32  <jarib> ugh, the android part of the build is truly horrible
2011-08-08T14:06:54  <jarib> and slows down things for everyone by doing things outside the rake rules (e.g. on startup)
2011-08-08T14:07:05  <krosenvold> The whole selenium build is horrible. And this is not a complaint about cfb/rake ;)
2011-08-08T14:07:42  * krosenvold complains about the general complexity of "stuff"
2011-08-08T14:07:49  <andytinkham1> Given this HTML: <input class="save panther-button panther-button-ie" type="submit" value="Save"/>, should this CSS selector work in IE? input.save[value='Save']  It seems to not be actually clicking the button (or at least not submitting after it's clicked)
2011-08-08T14:08:45  <jarib> if the element wasn't found, you wouldn't be able to call #click on it
2011-08-08T14:08:56  <jarib> you'd get an exception about it not being found
2011-08-08T14:09:36  <AutomatedTester> krosenvold: its apparently based on the Google system and we have seen they only hire MSc or higher...
2011-08-08T14:09:39  <andytinkham1> jarib: Element was found. Highlight appears on it in the window. I had to change the New Patient button to find the button not the span though to get the click registered, and I'm wondering if something similar is happening here (though I have no idea how it could)
