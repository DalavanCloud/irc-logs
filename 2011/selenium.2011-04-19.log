2011-04-19T04:16:39  <adamgoucher> so if i wanted to wrap my head around the webdriver api (for say writing a se-ide formatter) -- it is just enough to basically understand commands.py / commands.rb?
2011-04-19T04:18:38  <adamgoucher> actuall, better to look at org.openqa.selenium.internal.*

2011-04-19T04:29:57  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: if you want to see the API I suggest looking at the IDL that is being formatted

2011-04-19T04:31:33  <adamgoucher> i dont suppose anyone has nice written up the mapping between rc <-> webdriver?
2011-04-19T04:33:24  <AutomatedTester> not yet
2011-04-19T04:33:39  <AutomatedTester> Simon apparent has a server side emulator working
2011-04-19T04:34:16  <AutomatedTester> so that no clients have to worry about it
2011-04-19T04:35:12  <adamgoucher> right. but for me, i have to take what se-ide wants to export as rc code and flip it to rc
2011-04-19T04:35:16  <adamgoucher> erm, to webdriver
2011-04-19T04:35:35  *** kylls has joined #selenium
2011-04-19T04:35:59  <AutomatedTester> i suspect going from IDE to webdriver would be better

2011-04-19T04:37:07  <adamgoucher> and i am. but the way formatters work is 'if i am command x, then export y' -- i dont know the relationships between the two apis
2011-04-19T04:38:16  <davehunt> adamgoucher: I looked into writing a WebDriver formatter for IDE and promptly gave up
2011-04-19T04:38:37  <adamgoucher> thanks for the confidence boost :P
2011-04-19T04:38:39  <davehunt> I'm not sure how easy it'll be with the existing formatter code

2011-04-19T04:39:16  <davehunt> adamgoucher: It might be worth speaking with Samit, I know he has some great ideas wrt formatters
2011-04-19T04:39:29  <adamgoucher> noted

2011-04-19T04:39:55  <adamgoucher> nah. i'm pretty much figured it out

2011-04-19T04:41:04  <davehunt> We have a pretty major bug in #1571

2011-04-19T04:41:21  <davehunt> Affects Firefox 3.6 and 4.0
2011-04-19T04:41:23  <adamgoucher> heh! i was guessing at the term. but that reaction i think makes me think i got it right
2011-04-19T04:41:49  <davehunt> I'm starting to think this is more of an issue related to the page your unloading rather than the one your loading though
2011-04-19T04:42:38  <davehunt> There's some code that unwraps the current window object that Simon added. It looks like if I step through the unwrap code I get a window object that is a XPCNativeWrapper, however when I step over it I get a XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper. The latter seems to cause the issue.
2011-04-19T04:42:52  * davehunt thinks AutomatedTester did actually run away
2011-04-19T04:43:02  <davehunt> :)
2011-04-19T04:43:23  * AutomatedTester has his fingers in his ears going LALALLALALA, not my problem LALALALALA

2011-04-19T04:47:45  <AutomatedTester> thanks jarib
2011-04-19T04:48:06  <AutomatedTester> so...
2011-04-19T04:48:08  <adamgoucher> for the curious, there is 153 methods in the python rc api one needs to care about
2011-04-19T04:48:48  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: care about in what way?
2011-04-19T04:49:13  <adamgoucher> in the context of doing a mapping
2011-04-19T04:49:23  <adamgoucher> (coulda done it in java, but, its java)
2011-04-19T04:49:38  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: thats why we are moving to a server side issue
2011-04-19T04:49:48  <AutomatedTester> which Simon has "working"
2011-04-19T04:50:43  <AutomatedTester> so the issue is the Outer and Inner Window of the Browser get out of sync while a page is unloading and then loading
2011-04-19T04:50:55  <AutomatedTester> davehunt: ^
2011-04-19T04:51:14  <AutomatedTester> so your issue and #1438 are very similar
2011-04-19T04:51:15  <selbot2>  open/accepted WebDriver + Firefox 4: this.getWindow() is null - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1438
2011-04-19T04:51:30  <davehunt> AutomatedTester: and the solution is...? :)
2011-04-19T04:51:53  <davehunt> This affects 3.6 in my case
2011-04-19T04:52:00  <adamgoucher> heh. ah. well, its only 8am so it only took twice for me to understand. so in theory just need to change the constructor to RemoteWebDriver and a selenium emulation capability(?) and things 'magically' work?
2011-04-19T04:52:07  <AutomatedTester> what we, Simon commited, was to add a nasty setTimeout to get the page windows to sync up
2011-04-19T04:52:28  <AutomatedTester> this is a "feature" of Firefox
2011-04-19T04:52:45  <AutomatedTester> and I am trying to find the right person to pester to make them see this is a bug
2011-04-19T04:52:49  *** soc42 has quit IRC
2011-04-19T04:52:50  <davehunt> AutomatedTester: I'm not sure the issues are the same. I am working off trunk

2011-04-19T04:53:15  <AutomatedTester> the hack was added to Selenium-Core
2011-04-19T04:54:14  <davehunt> okay, but this was working in 3.6 before
2011-04-19T04:54:49  <davehunt> so I don't understand why we need a hack, and if a hack has been committed it's not working for me
2011-04-19T04:56:48  <AutomatedTester> well we needed a hack to make RC work
2011-04-19T04:57:16  <AutomatedTester> the new JS engine in Firefox4 made this more obvious
2011-04-19T04:57:28  <AutomatedTester> the issue has always been there
2011-04-19T04:57:43  <davehunt> I think these are different issues then
2011-04-19T04:58:26  <davehunt> This one is an issue trying to change the window.location after the window object has been 'unwrapped'
2011-04-19T04:58:51  * AutomatedTester goes to find the IRC logs
2011-04-19T04:59:19  <AutomatedTester> the window.location gives the wrong object when the inner and outer window are out of sync
2011-04-19T04:59:46  *** epsas has quit IRC
2011-04-19T04:59:54  <AutomatedTester> if you "slow" it down then you get the XPCNativeWrapper that you can then unwrap
2011-04-19T05:00:27  <davehunt> I see, however we don't need to unwrap for Firefox 3.6
2011-04-19T05:00:45  <davehunt> So since we added the unwrap it's caused the issue
2011-04-19T05:01:36  <davehunt> Can you point me to the commit of the hack?
2011-04-19T05:01:41  <davehunt> I can't find it

2011-04-19T08:21:37  <jarib> jimevans: have you had any flakiness with tests for navigating back/forward with IE?
2011-04-19T08:21:50  <ato> What's the reasoning behind now allowing clicking of disabled elements in WebDriver?
2011-04-19T08:21:55  <ato> s/now/not
2011-04-19T08:22:04  <jarib> that a user can't
2011-04-19T08:22:17  <jarib> oh wait
2011-04-19T08:22:17  <jarib> disabled
2011-04-19T08:22:28  <jarib> hmm, good question
2011-04-19T08:22:31  <jimevans> jarib: haven't really seen any issues with back/forward.
2011-04-19T08:22:32  <ato> But if I tell the WebDriver to do something, I want it to do what I tell it to.
2011-04-19T08:22:46  <jarib> a user can absolutely click a disabled element
2011-04-19T08:23:02  <jarib> so that doesn't make much sense
2011-04-19T08:23:26  <ato> The use case here is that we want to test whether clicking a disabled input element… crashes the browser, or that it doesn't actually get checked.
2011-04-19T08:23:44  <jarib> i see a reason for not allowing clicks on non-visible elements
2011-04-19T08:23:53  <jarib> on disabled elements, i can't see any reason to disallow it
2011-04-19T08:23:59  <ato> Oh yes, that needs to stay in.
2011-04-19T08:24:20  <ato> We could probably rescue the exception, but it doesn't seem like a good solution.
2011-04-19T08:24:27  <jimevans> ato, jarib: advanced user interactions api?
2011-04-19T08:24:28  <jarib> i'd say raise this on the selenium-dev list, explaining your use case
2011-04-19T08:24:36  <ato> So currently we've made a static flag in OperaDriver so we build internal versions of the jar.
2011-04-19T08:24:59  <ato> jimevans: Can you elaborate?  We've already implemented most of that.
2011-04-19T08:25:54  <jarib> jimevans: i'm seeing this spec failing quite often on IE only: http://www.google.com/codesearch/p?hl=en#2tHw6m3DZzo/trunk/common/test/rb/spec/navigation_spec.rb&q=navigation_spec.rb%20package:http://selenium%5C.googlecode%5C.com&l=4
2011-04-19T08:25:55  <jimevans> the "mouseclick" operation in the advanced interactions api doesn't do any checking about element status.
2011-04-19T08:26:22  <AutomatedTester> i thought that info was all server side?
2011-04-19T08:27:26  <jimevans> it is. my point is rather than doing a WebElement.click(), you do a moveto(element) [moves to the center of the element] and a mouseclick().
2011-04-19T08:27:47  <jimevans> which blindly clicks at the mouse coordinates (if I'm understanding the api correctly).

2011-04-19T08:29:48  <ato> jimevans: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/AdvancedUserInteractions ← do you mean void click(WebElement onElement)?
2011-04-19T08:29:56  <jimevans> jarib:oh, wait. your spec doesn't do the same thing my back/forward tests do.
2011-04-19T08:30:16  <ato> jimevans: Or should I be looking at the reference implementation in HtmlUnit?
2011-04-19T08:30:18  <jimevans> ato: yeah, that would do it, i believe.
2011-04-19T08:30:19  <jarib> jimevans: oops
2011-04-19T08:30:28  <jarib> that code searhc isn't correct
2011-04-19T08:30:35  <jarib> it's outdated
2011-04-19T08:31:10  <jarib> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/rb/spec/integration/selenium/webdriver/navigation_spec.rb#4
2011-04-19T08:31:13  <jarib> that's the one
2011-04-19T08:31:17  <jarib> it fails on line 9
2011-04-19T08:31:34  <jarib>      Failure/Error: driver.title.should == "We Arrive Here"
2011-04-19T08:31:34  <jarib>        expected: "We Arrive Here"
2011-04-19T08:31:34  <jarib>             got: "We Leave From Here" (using ==)
2011-04-19T08:32:28  <jimevans> okay, that doesn't sound like it has anything to do with back/forward. the submit is not working as it should.
2011-04-19T08:32:53  <jarib> ah
2011-04-19T08:33:18  <jimevans> we're losing the race condition during the submit, i'd wager.
2011-04-19T08:33:41  <jarib> would a click be better?
2011-04-19T08:34:46  <jarib> hmm, no
2011-04-19T08:35:14  <jimevans> under the covers, we're doing a .Click() anyway.
2011-04-19T08:35:29  <jarib> right
2011-04-19T08:35:36  <jimevans> so it's the standard race condition with clicks.
2011-04-19T08:36:34  <jimevans> for what it's worth, i'm testing back/forward in isolation from clicks and submits in the .net tests.
2011-04-19T08:36:42  <jarib> just using .get?
2011-04-19T08:37:15  <jimevans> i.e., the test navigates to page 1, then navigates to page 2 (yes, using .get), then calls back()/forward().
2011-04-19T08:37:30  <jarib> looks like i've stolen this from PageLoadingTest.java:126
2011-04-19T08:38:22  <jimevans> yeah, hold on.
2011-04-19T08:38:48  <jimevans> i'm looking at the wrong test file. .net tests back/forward in two different places.
2011-04-19T08:39:54  <jimevans> ok in PageLoadingTest.cs (and .java), there's no guard against the submit() not happening fast enough.
2011-04-19T08:40:02  <jimevans> it could break there.
2011-04-19T08:40:10  <jarib> indeed
2011-04-19T08:40:19  <jimevans> i know of no way to synchronize the ie driver any more than i already to.
2011-04-19T08:41:22  <jimevans> i added a comment to #232 explaining the wait algorithm of the ie driver. it might be instructive.

2011-04-19T08:43:55  <ato> jimevans: “If this element is not clickable, then this operation is a no-op since it's pretty common fore someone to accidentally miss the target when clicking in Real Life” (from WebElement.java interface)
2011-04-19T08:44:01  <jimevans> yes, it's used for get(), back(), forward(), click(), and submit().
2011-04-19T08:44:16  <jarib> ok

2011-04-19T08:45:13  <jarib> jimevans: and for refresh()?
2011-04-19T08:45:21  <jimevans> however, in the case of back(), and forward(), those should be synchronous, because we're calling the IWebBrowser2::GoBack() and ::FoForward() methods.
2011-04-19T08:45:35  <jimevans> s/::FoForward()/::GoForward()
2011-04-19T08:45:39  <jarib> aha

2011-04-19T08:50:38  <ato> jimevans: Looking at click() in HtmlUnitWebElement.java it's actually clicking if disabled (by catching exception), is this the relevant piece of code?
2011-04-19T08:51:31  <jimevans> ato: i'm not sure. i've not looked at the htmlunit implementation.
2011-04-19T08:51:54  <ato> I thought HtmlUnit was the only implementation that had implemented this advanced user interaction API?
2011-04-19T08:52:13  <jarib> IE too
2011-04-19T08:52:35  <jimevans> IE mostly. :)
2011-04-19T08:53:03  <jimevans> (still can't do double-click or context-click, shared native event code doesn't support it yet)
2011-04-19T08:53:21  <ato> So is that available in Java, or just in C#?
2011-04-19T08:53:47  <jarib> though it doesn't make sense that WebElement.click() and clicking through the advanced user interaction API have different semantics
2011-04-19T08:53:54  <jimevans> should be everywhere it's implemented in remote.
2011-04-19T08:54:12  <jarib> ato: it's available in Java/C#/Ruby atm, with a patch landing soon for python
2011-04-19T08:55:04  <jimevans> using the advanced api doesn't check for element availability, i know that much.
2011-04-19T08:55:12  <jimevans> and it won't.
2011-04-19T08:55:34  <jimevans> the semantics of the API are such that it allows clicking at an arbitrary x,y.
2011-04-19T08:55:43  <jimevans> regardless of what's there.
2011-04-19T08:56:43  <jarib> jimevans: i seem to recall reading something that would indicate WebElement.click() would be implemented as getMouse().click(this.getLocation()) or some such
2011-04-19T08:56:55  <jarib> can't remember exactly. i may be wrong
2011-04-19T08:57:16  <ato> jarib: That seems to be what the HtmlUnitWebElement is doing.
2011-04-19T08:58:07  <jimevans> sure. that would be consistent then. it would depend on whether getLocation() returned an error if the element isn't visible/enabled.
2011-04-19T08:58:27  <ato> They do that checking before getting coordinates as far as I can see.
2011-04-19T08:58:29  <jarib> for non-visible, having getLocation raise makes sense indeed
2011-04-19T08:58:49  <ato> Although there is no differentiation between visible element and disabled element; there is just InvalidElementStateException.
2011-04-19T08:58:50  <jimevans> right, but i don't believe it does for disabled. i'd have to look at the atom code.
2011-04-19T08:59:14  <jimevans> ato: for clicking, at the moment, no, there's no difference.

2011-04-19T09:00:40  <jimevans> but again, using the interactions API should allow you to click at an arbitrary location without regard to the visibility/enabled state of the element underneath the coordinates.

2011-04-19T09:38:23  <jimevans> odd. i get nativeEvent: true from ff4.
2011-04-19T09:38:26  <jarib> if it works for you with 4

2011-04-19T09:42:02  <selbot2> eran.mes@gmail.com 4 days ago - EranMes: Implementing the moveto command for Firefox. This implementation, while funtionally correct, is not optimal for two reasons: First, the current X,Y coordinates are not stored as a part of the session but on the firefoxDriver instance itself. Second, the current resolution for generating the mouse move events is too low which means the mouse cursor will not end up on the desired coordinates. Both issues ...

2011-04-19T10:30:31  *** Archdude_ is now known as Archdude
2011-04-19T10:30:41  <jimevans> yes, the script engine is initialized. you can find elements in an xml document using javascript against the dom.
2011-04-19T10:31:29  <jimevans> however, in the case of the IE driver, the minute you try to do anything with that element, we check to verify it's in a valid HTML DOM by walking nodes to the root to see if we have an <html> element at the root.
2011-04-19T10:32:08  <jimevans> In the case of a raw XML document, we don't, so we assume the DOM node you have is disconnected from its DOM (as a stale element would be).
