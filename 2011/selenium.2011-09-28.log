2011-09-28T00:03:15  <simonstewart> I think that the facebook PHP bindings are the ones that people are consolidating on
2011-09-28T00:07:59  <barancev|2> is it one of the frameworks mentioned by adam?

2011-09-28T00:09:57  <simonstewart> Yeah. Same chap, new location

2011-09-28T00:10:43  <barancev|2> I see, it must be the replacement for https://github.com/jubishop/php-webdriver that is 404 now
2011-09-28T00:11:01  <simonstewart> yup
2011-09-28T00:13:13  <barancev|2> is the mantra "selenium should not allow what user can't do by hands" still valid?

2011-09-28T00:15:11  <andreastt> That depends on the web browser AFAIK.
2011-09-28T00:15:19  <barancev|2> should we allow to do it?
2011-09-28T00:15:38  <andreastt> Morning, by the way. (-:

2011-09-28T00:17:33  <barancev|2> which of supported browsers allows to clean file input fields?
2011-09-28T00:17:58  <simonstewart> barancev|2: yeah, they should be able to do it
2011-09-28T00:18:09  <simonstewart> The Win32 file input element is a text field with a button
2011-09-28T00:19:50  <barancev|2> simonstewart: in IE -- yes, in chrome -- no

2011-09-28T00:20:41  <simonstewart> But we should try and be consistent, and you can certainly clear it in IE
2011-09-28T00:20:55  <barancev|2> I don't know how to clean file input in FF manually
2011-09-28T00:21:00  <simonstewart> Which OS?
2011-09-28T00:22:06  <barancev|2> well, really, I could clear it in IE
2011-09-28T00:22:15  <andreastt> Neither Fx, Chrome or Opera allows clearing of the file field in their desktop browsers I think.
2011-09-28T00:22:20  <barancev|2> but I can't do that in FF and Chrome

2011-09-28T03:59:17  <fotios1> darius_w: take a look at http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/TakesScreenshot.html
2011-09-28T04:00:10  <fotios1> i dont do java, but it looks like you might be able to do "String screenshotBase64 = ((Screenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(base64);"
2011-09-28T04:03:03  <jarib> fotios1: that's the webdriver api, looks like darius_w is using the rc api
2011-09-28T04:03:17  <darius_w> yes, I use RC
2011-09-28T04:03:24  <fotios1> then upgrade ;)
2011-09-28T04:03:35  <darius_w> I use it on remote server
2011-09-28T04:04:28  <darius_w> test runs on one server and browser is on another server.. and I do not understand how webdriver can replace RC
2011-09-28T04:05:04  <fotios1> darius_w: i was only joking, but if you wanted to, that's the exact way webdriver works too
2011-09-28T04:05:27  <fotios1> you have a webdriver hub, and then webdriver nodes
2011-09-28T04:05:32  <fotios1> the nodes are the ones with the browsers
2011-09-28T04:05:58  <fotios1> and they connect to the hub and say "i can run 5 firefox tests, 2 chrome tests, and an IE test"
2011-09-28T04:06:29  <fotios1> then your tests code connects to the hub and says "run this test on firefox"
2011-09-28T04:06:37  <darius_w> so nodes still need RC server, yes?
2011-09-28T04:06:46  <fotios1> well the hub takes the place of the rc server
2011-09-28T04:07:10  <fotios1> its one java jar, you just specify -role hub or -role webdriver
2011-09-28T04:07:32  <darius_w> oh..
2011-09-28T04:07:39  <fotios1> you can also speficy -role rc and AFAIK it will act like rc
2011-09-28T04:07:56  <fotios1> so you could get your env working first, then slowly move your tests over
2011-09-28T04:08:03  <fotios1> but dont quote me on that, ive never done it
2011-09-28T04:08:26  <darius_w> so only api is different
2011-09-28T04:08:27  <darius_w> ?
2011-09-28T04:08:41  <fotios1> ya
2011-09-28T04:09:00  <fotios1> the bigger difference is how it all works behind the scenes
2011-09-28T04:09:18  <fotios1> but from a tester's POV, the client libraries are different
2011-09-28T04:09:54  <fotios1> and now you can much easierly(?) write tests in every language
2011-09-28T04:10:06  <fotios1> works great for writing in ruby and using in a testsuite

2011-09-28T04:12:29  <darius_w> if I understand that correct: with webdrive my tests will work as is with RC. until I change them, and then half test can be like RC and other like WebDriver ?
2011-09-28T04:12:55  *** cheezy has quit IRC
2011-09-28T04:14:03  <jarib> darius_w: API is different, the underlying tech to drive the browser is different, and you can use webdriver without the server when you don't need it (i.e. just run your test code locally)

2011-09-28T05:54:31  <jarib> ah, i'm wrong
2011-09-28T05:54:38  <jarib> the tests must have been failing on something else
2011-09-28T05:54:43  <jarib> it works with -autotestmode
2011-09-28T05:54:57  <jarib> let me try running the tests

2011-09-28T05:56:38  <andreastt> jarib: If it's related to the popup license dialogue, you can test it by `rm -rf ~/.opera-next`.
2011-09-28T05:56:45  <andreastt> Or alterting the opera.ini file.
2011-09-28T05:56:52  <andreastt> Possibly called operaprefs.ini.
2011-09-28T05:57:05  <jarib> i'll vnc in and watch the test run
2011-09-28T05:57:58  <jarib> and we'll see

2011-09-28T06:08:04  <cgoldberg> ^^ execution time of individual tests... I installed FF 7 at build #47
2011-09-28T06:08:38  <davehunt_> cgoldberg: what are you measuring? it could be Firefox's improved startup time

2011-09-28T06:09:06  <davehunt_> There have been a number of performance related improvements in Firefox 7
2011-09-28T06:09:11  <cgoldberg> davehunt_, that's what i'm thinking.. those times include browser startup/quit

2011-09-28T06:10:00  <jarib> ok, so improved start up time could account for the impact

2011-09-28T06:11:05  <cgoldberg> just a nice surprise.. as other upgrades of FF haven't really effected my runtimes in any statistically significant way
2011-09-28T06:13:08  <davehunt_> cgoldberg: are you testing in other browsers too? If so, how does Firefox 7 compare to those?

2011-09-28T06:15:27  <jarib> i think this is happening because i added more workers on the xserve directly
2011-09-28T06:15:37  <jarib> and it's trying to launch firefox there

2011-09-28T07:19:24  <jimevans> barancev: i've not yet tried to look at that issue. the problem is likely somewhere in the findElement atom, as we delegate directly to the atom for finding elements except for xpath and css selctor.

2011-09-28T07:20:20  <jimevans> i strongly suspect this might be a scenario where the atoms expect IE to behave one way, but IE 9 behaves differently because it follows more of the standards.

2011-09-28T07:55:49  <andreastt> You need to install libprotobuf6.
2011-09-28T07:55:51  <jarib> k
2011-09-28T07:55:56  <jarib> thanks
2011-09-28T07:56:07  <andreastt> That should probably be explained better in the exception…
2011-09-28T07:56:20  <andreastt> Stuk: ^--
2011-09-28T07:57:21  <Stuk> andreastt: would need to be fixed in the launcher I think
2011-09-28T07:57:57  <andreastt> We could guess if on GNU/Linux platform that this is the problem, like we do with Visual C++ lib on Windows.
2011-09-28T07:58:08  <andreastt> Although I agree that's not perfect.
2011-09-28T07:58:29  <lord1234> pervertedjustice: you can just find all elements
2011-09-28T07:58:55  *** andreashaas has joined #selenium
2011-09-28T07:59:09  <jimevans> pervertedjustice: call findElements(By.tagName("option")) on your select element.
2011-09-28T07:59:21  <jimevans> you can iterate through the element list returned.
2011-09-28T07:59:48  <jimevans> (this advice assumes you're using standard HTML elements, not a bastardized javascript framework)
2011-09-28T08:00:05  <jarib> andreastt: looks like i can only get libprotobuf5 from apt, will that work?
2011-09-28T08:00:14  <jimevans> (and further assumes you're using the WebDriver API as opposed to the RC API)
2011-09-28T08:00:17  * jarib tries
2011-09-28T08:00:36  <jarib> hm, nope
2011-09-28T08:01:24  <andreastt> Needs to be a more recent version I think.
2011-09-28T08:01:55  <andreastt> Stuk: Hang on.  Wasn't libprotobuf6 meant to be statically compiled?  Or did we reach the conclusion it would get too big?
2011-09-28T08:02:15  *** k04n has joined #selenium
2011-09-28T08:02:19  <andreastt> I guess the question depends on when that decision was made.
2011-09-28T08:02:23  <Stuk> andreastt: ...can't remember what the conclusion of that was...
2011-09-28T08:02:30  <Stuk> I think it might be static on windows, but not on others
2011-09-28T08:02:34  <andreastt> Because we originally planned to include it in the Desktop release… and I remember the Desktop people said no.
2011-09-28T08:02:35  <jarib> so operadriver won't work on lucid. hmm
2011-09-28T08:02:37  <k04n> Hey, does anyone know why the latest version of Selenium IDE doesn't seem to have the PHP formatter for PHP code export?  Was this removed, or is there a place I can get it from?
2011-09-28T08:02:42  <jarib> may have to update the base box then

2011-09-28T08:03:46  <andreastt> jarib: It will work if you recompile the launcher with libprotobuf6 statically.
2011-09-28T08:03:50  <andreastt> But I guess we should fix that.

2011-09-28T10:19:37  <RandLAT> I've been using Selenium IDE for a few weeks. It's kinda neat, but as some in here suggested, I should look into Selenium WebDriver. The fact that it can help testing on more than just Firefox is potentially a great selling point. I'm reading http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html#chapter03-reference for now, but wondering if there's a better tutorial out there. Thanks in advance.

2011-09-28T11:23:49  <lord1234> so a friend says to me "how do i find if there is a certain piece of text on the page", I say "the entire page", "yes", and the only thing I can think of is string = driver.find_element(:tag_name, "body").text and parse that to see if string contains the text u want
2011-09-28T11:23:50  <lord1234> right?

2011-09-28T11:26:20  <lord1234> i told him that he was stuck with a really sucky problem because he'll load the page source into memory every time, which is ridiculous, but whatever
2011-09-28T11:26:34  <lord1234> he's basically looking for a replacement for RC's is_text_present function
2011-09-28T11:27:11  <barancev> is_text_present is a silly alert
2011-09-28T11:27:54  <barancev> let's suppose I've added a user with name=a to an application and want to check it is present in the user list
2011-09-28T11:28:30  <barancev> is_text_present("a") - false positive is what I'll get in 90%

2011-09-28T11:54:41  <lukeis> but in general, not really... you could always just set the style of the element to "border: 3px solid red;"
2011-09-28T11:55:31  <lukeis> executeScript("arguments[0].style.border = '3px solid red';", webElement) ;)
2011-09-28T11:55:49  <lukeis> voila, highlight ;)
2011-09-28T11:56:37  <lukeis> might need a "display = 'block'" too though... depending on the webElement

2011-09-28T14:35:19  <autojack> my mistake
2011-09-28T14:35:32  <autojack> huh. so is this a bug or a feature? :)
2011-09-28T14:36:11  <barancev> well, I can't describe in details what's the current rule set about spaces :)
2011-09-28T14:36:18  <barancev> but lemme try your sample
2011-09-28T14:37:19  *** jonathanrwallace has joined #selenium
2011-09-28T14:38:07  <kboers> Is anyone familiar with the Apache license that Selenium uses?
2011-09-28T14:38:56  <barancev> autojack: driver.find_element :link_text => "New  "
2011-09-28T14:39:07  <barancev> you need two spaces after New
2011-09-28T14:39:13  <autojack> haha. so that works?
2011-09-28T14:39:32  <barancev> yes
2011-09-28T14:39:41  <autojack> brutal.
2011-09-28T14:39:54  <barancev> don't ask me why :)
2011-09-28T14:39:56  <autojack> seems like before maybe it was using a loose match, and now it has to be exact.
2011-09-28T14:40:34  <barancev> it was discussed so many times - what to do with spaces, especially non-breaking spaces
2011-09-28T14:40:52  <autojack> * Improved handling of non-breaking spaces for Element#text.
2011-09-28T14:41:03  <autojack> that's in the 2.4 changelist
2011-09-28T14:41:10  <autojack> "improved" :@
2011-09-28T14:41:18  <barancev> it is improving all the way
2011-09-28T14:41:23  <autojack> hehe
2011-09-28T14:41:34  <autojack> I wonder why we even have the space
2011-09-28T14:42:00  <barancev> because someone wants loose matching, but others prefer strict
2011-09-28T14:42:05  <Dude-X> i've had to change some of my tests due to the new space handling in 2.4
2011-09-28T14:42:17  <autojack> aha
2011-09-28T14:42:23  <autojack> sigh
2011-09-28T14:42:28  <Dude-X> but this is a java project
2011-09-28T14:43:00  * Dude-X wants to test selenium 2.7
2011-09-28T14:43:01  <autojack> so in your case, they aren't really spaces, they are spaces encoded as java byte arrays?
2011-09-28T14:43:04  <barancev> huh, I never use linkText locators in my production tests :)
2011-09-28T14:43:07  <autojack> ;)
2011-09-28T14:43:27  <autojack> yeah, maybe that is the answer for us..
2011-09-28T14:43:33  <autojack> what would you use in my case though?
2011-09-28T14:43:33  <Dude-X> well we'd do asserts on some of the text
2011-09-28T14:43:35  <autojack> xpath?
2011-09-28T14:44:02  <Dude-X> we use xpaths for 90% of our elements
2011-09-28T14:44:15  <autojack> hm. I would expect that to be really brittle.
2011-09-28T14:44:17  <barancev> you have classes assigned to your elements -- so use css
2011-09-28T14:44:22  <autojack> nod
2011-09-28T14:44:23  <autojack> we could
2011-09-28T14:44:46  <Dude-X> i think CSS selectors would be better, and there's a tech debt to add more CSS selectors so that one day we can test against IE instead of Firefox

2011-09-28T15:08:01  <jarib> hopefully not too outdated..
2011-09-28T15:08:45  <jarib> rtyler: json_pure has traditionally been the least problematic json dependency IME, which is why i chose it
2011-09-28T15:08:58  <jarib> we'll use the json gem or yajl if available
2011-09-28T15:09:06  <jarib> what conflict are you seeing?
2011-09-28T15:10:15  <rtyler> well, I fixed it by forking and building the gem with a json depenency
2011-09-28T15:10:31  <rtyler> jarib: our rails2 project was seeing /weird/ functional test failures for views that generate JSON
2011-09-28T15:10:43  <rtyler> easier to fork than figure out how the fak the two were conflicting

2011-09-28T15:16:25  <Renacor> is there  a way for selenium to tell the browser to freez the dom or something so that you can avoid the StaleElementReference exception?

2011-09-28T15:25:39  <algard> only as lame as writing bad tests that touch stale elelents ;)
2011-09-28T15:26:05  <Renacor> algard: I have no way of knowing it's stale until I ask for it
2011-09-28T15:27:16  <algard> would driver.getPageSource() work for you?
2011-09-28T15:27:45  <Renacor> algard: it might, looking into that righ tnow
2011-09-28T15:28:33  <Dude-X> in our project (using java bindings of webdriver) we overide click so that it will check if an element is visible, or clickable until the specified timeout, ignoring exceptions
2011-09-28T15:28:51  <Dude-X> but you can use the webdriverWait class instead

2011-09-28T17:47:17  <nirvdrum> You could try to wrap your callbacks I guess, but there's no way Selenium can generally do that because Ajax requests can be initiated whenever.
2011-09-28T17:47:27  <nirvdrum> So, Selenium would never know the request was made to begin with.
