2011-10-04T03:21:04  <eranm> jarib, as I suspected
2011-10-04T03:21:04  <eranm> However, doing some performance improvement work on this code isn't a bad idea
2011-10-04T03:21:45  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-10-04T03:21:53  <Elvanor> eranm: hi. I investigated more and you were right the problem is linked to coordinates
2011-10-04T03:22:19  <Elvanor> Sometimes (about 30% of the time) the coordinates of the click sent by webdriver is wrong.
2011-10-04T03:22:45  <Elvanor> It only happens on the first click. And the coordinates sent by webElement.getLocation() are right... so what could be wrong?
2011-10-04T03:22:55  <eranm> the state of the page
2011-10-04T03:23:01  <jarib> AutomatedTester: awesome, thanks
2011-10-04T03:23:14  <Elvanor> eranm: what do you mean, state of the page?
2011-10-04T03:23:22  <eranm> if it hasn't fully rendered yet, or if your javascript library has not finished arranging elements on the page
2011-10-04T03:23:45  *** pnitin has joined #selenium
2011-10-04T03:23:55  <Elvanor> eranm: I suspect the JS library has not finished arranging elements; however, in that case why webElement.getLocation() gets the correct coordinates?
2011-10-04T03:24:47  <eranm> My guess is that you call getLocation() after you perform the click, by that time everything is properly arranged on the page
2011-10-04T03:25:08  <eranm> What you could do is to explicitly wait for the location to be right before calling click
2011-10-04T03:26:27  <Elvanor> eranm: no, I call getLocation() before the click
2011-10-04T03:29:02  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-10-04T03:30:20  <Elvanor> My exact setup is this one: I have a container element and I add two elements inside it. I click on the second one, however sometimes the click is sent as if it were the first one, eg it seems like the first one has not rendered yet
2011-10-04T03:30:33  <eranm> Elvanor, do you see any case where getLocation returns the right coordinates but click afterwards clicks on the wrong place?
2011-10-04T03:30:36  <Elvanor> If I change my app code not to add the first element, I never get the problem
2011-10-04T03:30:46  <Elvanor> eranm: yes indeed
2011-10-04T03:30:51  <Elvanor> it is always the case
2011-10-04T03:31:13  <Elvanor> eg, getLocation() always get the correct coordinates, but click afterwards (30% of times) clicks on wrong place
2011-10-04T03:33:33  <eranm> Elvanor, now is the stage were a code example (+html page!) would be handy

2011-10-04T04:00:14  <mltolun> thanks, will do it that way
2011-10-04T04:00:29  <mltolun> I'm trying to implement a Selenium Grid
2011-10-04T04:00:42  <mltolun> and I got to the point where I have 2 JUnits
2011-10-04T04:01:02  <mltolun> and want to execute them distributed
2011-10-04T04:01:16  <mltolun> what is the best way to execute them?
2011-10-04T04:01:34  <mltolun> I was trying to find a way to execute UT in parallel, using Maven or Spring runners...
2011-10-04T04:01:39  <mltolun> any suggestions?
2011-10-04T04:02:50  <mltolun> I have 2 webdriver clients..each can execute only 1 FF
2011-10-04T04:03:09  <mltolun> but when executing with Eclipse...they are being executed one after the other
2011-10-04T04:03:14  <AutomatedTester> mltolun: have you looked at a distributed java test runner?
2011-10-04T04:03:34  <barancev> mltolun: what do you unlike in maven and/or spring?
2011-10-04T04:04:13  <mltolun> What test runner would you recommend? I haven't been able to execute maven nor spring in parallel yet
2011-10-04T04:04:17  <barancev> why do you need to run parallel execution from eclipse IDE, why not from the console?
2011-10-04T04:05:15  <mltolun> AtuomatedTester, I've found a maven <parallel> node..but it seems is not working
2011-10-04T04:06:21  <mltolun> barancev, the final idea is to have something like this...Jenkins builds the code using Maven, when building it uses Surefire to execute JUnit tests...gets all the info from the results...and Fails or not the build
2011-10-04T04:06:35  <mltolun> I'm stuck in Maven executing things in parallel..
2011-10-04T04:06:56  <freynaud> mltolun: maven won't do anything more or less than what the underlying framework does.
2011-10-04T04:07:08  <freynaud> mltolun: you need to have that working
2011-10-04T04:07:40  <mltolun> freynaud, when you say "that" what do you mean?
2011-10-04T04:08:14  <barancev> for maven you may use surefire plugin to run tests
2011-10-04T04:08:16  <freynaud>  JUnits
2011-10-04T04:08:28  <barancev> it can parallelize junit and testng tests
2011-10-04T04:08:37  <freynaud> personaly,I'd use testng for webdriver tests in java
2011-10-04T04:08:40  <barancev> win testng you may use native parallelization
2011-10-04T04:09:05  <barancev> s/win/with/
2011-10-04T04:09:07  <mltolun> testNG has native parallelization?
2011-10-04T04:09:25  <barancev> yes, it has
2011-10-04T04:09:26  <mltolun> I think that is what I was missing
2011-10-04T04:09:47  <freynaud> more that just that. A lot of nice features that are very usefull for webdriver tests. Reports, dataproviders etc
2011-10-04T04:10:00  <barancev> http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#parallel-running
2011-10-04T04:10:16  <mltolun> nice
2011-10-04T04:11:00  <mltolun> and would you say an approach using Jenkins -> Maven -> Surefire -> TestNG is good?
2011-10-04T04:11:18  <mltolun> or there is a better approach?

2011-10-04T04:12:48  <freynaud> mltolun: what you describe is what I use, but it's not the solution to all problem. Any test strategy you understand in details and you're confortable with will give you good results
2011-10-04T04:13:55  <freynaud> __gotcha: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2 register a rc node, the code is backward compatible
2011-10-04T04:14:30  <mltolun> freynaud, agree. I'm not from the Java world and I do not know many of these tools, wanted to know if there is an "out of the box" approach
2011-10-04T04:15:01  <__gotcha> freynaud: I read that page
2011-10-04T04:15:15  <__gotcha> I must be missing sthing
2011-10-04T04:15:26  <freynaud> as long as you don't do some crazy stuff, the tools you described will intereact well together, so you wll not  waste too much time writing wrappers at least
2011-10-04T04:16:04  <freynaud> __gotcha: grid2 hub supports both webdriver and rc nodes
2011-10-04T04:16:07  <mltolun> freynaud, how to "really" use Selenium Grid is not documented anywhere..Docs tell you how to set the Grid, not how to send tests in parallel
2011-10-04T04:16:15  <freynaud> if you register a rc node, it will behave like grid1
2011-10-04T04:17:19  <mltolun> btw, thanks AutomatedTest, barancev and freynaud
2011-10-04T04:17:29  <barancev> mltolun: each language has its own test and parallel execution frameworks, they are many
2011-10-04T04:17:39  <freynaud> mltolun: grid gives you parallel tests, envt management, and automatic maintenance if you want by writing you own grid plugins
2011-10-04T04:17:51  <__gotcha> freynaud: iow, I should read grid 1 doc to understand which browser spec I should pass to RC
2011-10-04T04:18:24  <freynaud> __gotcha: if you never used grid1, why do you want Grid2 with sel1 mode ?
2011-10-04T04:19:06  <__gotcha> because the client code I use (robotframework-seleniumlibrary) still uses RC
2011-10-04T04:19:29  <freynaud> __gotcha: robot as in java robot ?
2011-10-04T04:20:00  <__gotcha> freynaud: afaik robotframework is Python first
2011-10-04T04:20:08  <__gotcha> event if it runs with Jython

2011-10-04T04:20:45  <freynaud> __gotcha: ok, i thought you were talking about a java thing, forget that last comment then
2011-10-04T04:20:53  <barancev> sometimes I use "shell parallel runs" -- start several testng instances with different config files on a master machine to work with grid that governs several slave machines
2011-10-04T04:25:06  <mltolun> barancev, bash?
2011-10-04T04:25:17  <__gotcha> freynaud: is there a way to find out which nodes are actually registered with a grid ?
2011-10-04T04:25:20  <barancev> yea ;)
2011-10-04T04:26:15  <mltolun> __gorcha, yes, you need to use the Grid console

2011-10-04T04:41:41  <__gotcha> in grid mode, my client code speaks to RC that speaks to hub that drives nodes that each drive a browser
2011-10-04T04:42:23  <freynaud> __gotcha: yes. The hub gets all the requests, find an available for each, and forwards

2011-10-04T06:57:38  <SamuraiJack> I downloaded FuncUnit package, which is based on Selenium - and its demos just shows the blank browser screen as well

2011-10-04T07:05:06  <dawagner> Why do we need a new annotation?
2011-10-04T07:05:18  <dawagner> It does the filling in of elements based on reflection on the type of the field
2011-10-04T07:05:28  <dawagner> Surely we could still just use FindBy?

2011-10-04T07:33:46  <eranm> Elvanor, just to be clear, it's low priority for me - you can work around this issue, while not having native events working for Firefox on Windows is something that can't be worked around.

2011-10-04T07:37:08  <eranm> Elvanor, also, it's missing the implementation for obtainDOMElementForQooxdooWidget, which is what I needed to see - if you're finding the element by xpath, for example, it could be that you're getting the wrong one
2011-10-04T07:37:27  <cheezy> we put a lot of print statements in the Wait method -> after adding the print statments we saw much fewer failures

2011-10-04T07:55:42  <eranm> Elvanor, how about attaching ids to the elements, using findElement to find them and ExpectedConditions until the element(s) are present and visible?
2011-10-04T07:56:42  <eranm> the way it's written now, it relies solely on the JS libraries to provide the elements and never waits for user-visible changes on the page before interacting with it. That means debugging these javascript libraries to get to the bottom of your test failure.
2011-10-04T07:57:45  *** SamuraiJack__ has quit IRC
2011-10-04T07:58:28  <Elvanor> eranm: let me try, not sure it will help
2011-10-04T07:59:37  <eranm> Elvanor, another possible cause is that the element is replaced by the Javascript library just before the click
2011-10-04T07:59:55  <Elvanor> what do you mean
2011-10-04T08:00:54  *** stephend has left #selenium
2011-10-04T08:00:55  <eranm> So when you call executeScript to get the element, WebDriver caches the actual DOM node that is represented by this WebElement
2011-10-04T08:01:39  <eranm> If this node is attached somewhere else in the tree or it's contents are completely replaced, you'll have a reference to the "wrong" element (except it's the same one WebDriver gave you)
2011-10-04T08:01:48  <barancev> eranm: have you added FF7 native events support for Linux only? what about Windows?
2011-10-04T08:02:00  <barancev> need more work?
2011-10-04T08:02:07  <eranm> barancev, doing that now

2011-10-04T08:03:41  <eranm> barancev, thanks, I'm almost there
2011-10-04T08:04:03  <eranm> AutomatedTester, not this release - I added the Linux support first because it's easier for me to build and test native events with the latest Firefox version on Linux.
2011-10-04T08:04:27  <eranm> Since that passed without any modifications to the rest of our code (this time...) I'm doing it now for Windows

2011-10-04T08:07:55  <barancev> i've tried another box -- all is good

2011-10-04T08:08:06  <jimevans> cheezy: so the logic of Wait for HtmlDialog is that we first have to check to see if we are closing (since showModalDialog windows don't implement DWebBrowserEvents2, and don't give us a Quit event)

2011-10-04T08:09:12  <eranm> Ajay, I side with him. After all, what could Apple renew with yet another iPhone? whereas we're going to show the world multiple bugfixes, barancev 's FindAllBy and support for Firefox 7 mere days after it was released.
2011-10-04T08:09:43  <eranm> barancev, I suspect it was broken because our build system is not very good at detecting native libraries being out-of-date, so it didn't rebuild the DLL-
2011-10-04T08:10:13  *** freynaud has quit IRC
2011-10-04T08:10:33  <jimevans> cheezy: if we don't think we're closing, then we check to see if either (a) we're navigating to a new page, or (b) we popped up another window via showModalDialog()
2011-10-04T08:10:54  <jimevans> two possibilities:
2011-10-04T08:10:56  <Ajay> eranm: i found that we have license for Visual studio 2007 professional, can i build the FF dll from that ?
2011-10-04T08:11:21  <eranm> Ajay, unfortunately not - you need VS 2010 for that
2011-10-04T08:11:48  <Ajay> Damn...
2011-10-04T08:11:58  <jimevans> cheezy: first, we could pause a bit after the call to FindContentWindowHandle if it returns an actual handle
2011-10-04T08:12:11  <jimevans> (actually, we should check to verify it returns an actual handle)
2011-10-04T08:12:51  <jimevans> second: we need to double-check that the logic of GetActiveDialogWindowHandle() is correct, and that we're detecting an actual popup window.
2011-10-04T08:12:53  <eranm> Looks like native events are working on Firefox 7 as well
2011-10-04T08:13:13  <Ajay> eranm: :)
2011-10-04T08:13:37  <jimevans> cheezy: i think that logic in HtmlDialog::FindChildDialogWindow() is correct, but I could easily be wrong.
2011-10-04T08:14:01  <Elvanor> eranm: I added new WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOf(logoutButton)) to my test, but it has no effect.
2011-10-04T08:14:07  <Elvanor> Wrong clicks are still sent.

2011-10-04T08:29:42  <eranm> Ajay, Firefox automatically updated itself to 7 on my Windows VM and I was too lazy to uninstall and re-install 6, so I had to do it :)

2011-10-04T08:31:47  <eranm> jimevans, just a heads-up: I'm about to add a new wire protocol command, sendKeys on the session (as opposed to on an element) that will send keyboard input to the active element and will *not* release the modifier keys at the end of the call (so the ability to press / release a specific modifier will be useful)

2011-10-04T08:43:35  <Elvanor> eranm: I mailed the Qooxdoo guys and they said that the rendering in their libraries is done asynchronously. However, they say the browser sometimes need some additional time to render

2011-10-04T08:44:38  <cheezy> btw -> first three runs worked perfectly with the Sleep but the fourth run failed -> IsWindow was false
2011-10-04T08:44:41  <jimevans> there's a possibility that the window is valid, but hasn't had time to instantiate the IHTMLDocument2 object inside it.
2011-10-04T08:44:55  <Elvanor> eranm: yeah, but if it was the case, then how come getLocation() is *always* correct
2011-10-04T08:44:57  <eranm> My tip is to try and find a *user visible* change and wait for it. If there's nothing user-visible, try to hook into rendering of the element and set something on the page to indicate the element is done rendering

2011-10-04T09:49:57  <Dude-X> for me, it's apple time.
2011-10-04T09:50:21  <Elvanor> algard: the problem is that most of the time they coincide. when they do not, my click bug appears.
2011-10-04T09:50:53  <algard> Elvanor, sounds like the click bug I was seeing
2011-10-04T09:51:12  <algard> i gave up and ended up using JS to work around it :\
2011-10-04T09:51:36  <eranm> Elvanor, getLocation returns to location on the DOM, getCoordinates calls getLocationOnceScrolledIntoView - which, obviously, scrolls the element
2011-10-04T09:52:00  <Elvanor> eranm: yes, but there is not scrolling there.
2011-10-04T09:54:02  <Elvanor> no* scrolling there
2011-10-04T09:54:08  <Elvanor> the web page has no scroll bars.
2011-10-04T09:54:31  <algard> Elvanor, any frames by any chance?
2011-10-04T09:54:31  <Elvanor> eranm: so there might be a bug in the FF extension code for these computations I guess
2011-10-04T09:54:37  <Elvanor> algard: no frames
2011-10-04T09:54:40  <algard> k
2011-10-04T09:55:15  <Elvanor> there is an iframe actually, but with display: none
2011-10-04T09:56:40  <eranm> Elvanor, the only situation where webdriver waits for anything is for the page loading to complete (and that depends on the browser's definition of complete).
2011-10-04T09:58:43  <Elvanor> eranm: what is that definition for FF ?
2011-10-04T09:58:54  <eranm> In other situations, it acts on the page at the state it finds. You could get into un-healthy situations where a mouse move, as a part of a click() call on an element, changes the page layout and then the click will go to the wrong place
2011-10-04T09:59:03  *** Spanktar has joined #selenium
2011-10-04T09:59:43  <eranm> Elvanor, you can have a look at the code in firefoxDriver.js (look for FirefoxDriver.prototype.get) for the definition
2011-10-04T10:00:45  <eranm> otherwise, if you want to, you can get the coordinates printed in wrappedElement.js (clickElement method) if you want to figure out exactly where WebDriver clicks

2011-10-04T11:29:25  <jarib-> jimevans: what do you want to know re watirspec?
2011-10-04T11:30:35  <jimevans> would it be fair to describe it as the specification for the watir api?
2011-10-04T11:31:20  <jarib-> jimevans: more or less, yes
2011-10-04T11:32:18  *** Ajay has joined #selenium
2011-10-04T11:32:20  <jarib-> it started out as a port (from test/unit to rspec) + cleanup of the original watir test suite

2011-10-04T11:33:42  <jarib-> for watir-webdriver, i branched it to do further cleanup of the API (including some backwards incompatible changes)
2011-10-04T11:33:51  <jimevans> i see. so it uses the rspec format for describing behaviour.
2011-10-04T11:34:27  <jarib-> and now vanilla watir is using that branch to try and catch up
2011-10-04T11:34:40  <jimevans> would that be the watir2 branch?

2011-10-04T11:35:08  <jarib-> (the branch removes a lot of inconsistencies + IE specific stuff in the original API)
2011-10-04T11:35:08  <jarib-> yes
2011-10-04T11:36:22  <jimevans> alright then. i wonder if the api and the spec for it could be ported to other languages... (he said cryptically)
2011-10-04T11:36:37  *** freynaud has joined #selenium
2011-10-04T11:37:42  <jarib-> the specs aren't great, there's still a lot of duplication (per tag name) inherited from the original watir tests

2011-10-04T11:38:27  <jarib-> oops. on a bus, flaky connection
2011-10-04T11:38:46  <jarib-> what is the last thing you read?
2011-10-04T11:39:06  <jimevans> you were talking about the specs not being great with a lot of duplication
2011-10-04T11:39:14  <jarib-> yeah
2011-10-04T11:40:17  <jarib-> if I were to do a watir API from scratch in another language, I wouldn't port the specs 1-to-1
2011-10-04T11:41:05  <jimevans> it'd be kinda cool to see a "this is what a watir-derived api should look and behave like" spec.
2011-10-04T11:41:33  <jarib-> a lot of what is essentially the same tests are duplicated for every tag name
2011-10-04T11:42:38  <jarib-> which has to do with how watir's internals worked and grew over time
2011-10-04T11:43:00  <jimevans> i'm sure.
2011-10-04T11:43:23  <jarib-> with watir-webdriver, those tests are mostly executing the same code path regardless of tag name

2011-10-04T11:43:45  <jimevans> that makes sense
2011-10-04T11:44:23  <jimevans> i know you told me before, but how much watir-webdriver code is generated, and how much hand-coded?

2011-10-04T11:45:12  <jarib-> don't know the exact number

2011-10-04T11:47:44  *** Ajay has quit IRC
2011-10-04T11:48:23  <jarib-> mostly it's just a map of tag name => class, and typed attributes for each element

2011-10-04T15:11:03  <andreastt> Either that, or we could stop checking out the SVN repo between versions… although that's not really an option.

2011-10-04T15:14:21  <dawagner> I don't quite follow how it'll solve it
2011-10-04T15:15:35  <andreastt> Some of the failing tests you added ignores for have fixes in the OperaDriver HEAD.
2011-10-04T15:16:14  <andreastt> In the SVN repo, we only have JARs of OperaDriver, so it's rarely up-to-date with all the tests.
2011-10-04T15:17:44  <jarib> you're thinking some sort of git -> svn external conversion thing

2011-10-04T15:20:00  <andreastt> I didn't originally consider to make it this complicated, but it might work well.

2011-10-04T15:46:13  <stackedsax> webdriver doesn't seem to like browsers with an asterisk — but using the json file seems to always add one.  How are people using firefox webdriver if this is the case?  does nobody use the json file to start the hub?

2011-10-04T15:54:55  <stackedsax> so, who uses a json file to start their hub around here?

2011-10-04T15:55:38  <stackedsax> the json file was one of the things that I was hoping to add to the grid2 wiki — people may not be using it much since it's not documented

2011-10-04T16:31:07  <stackedsax> there's this issue #2399

2011-10-04T16:31:32  <nirvdrum> Ahh.  I've seen the issue.  I haven't had the time to look into it yet.
2011-10-04T16:31:32  <stackedsax> I thought it was workaround-able, but now I'm feeling that it's not
2011-10-04T16:31:38  <nirvdrum> I'm still using the grid 1 YML file for my hub.
2011-10-04T16:31:51  <nirvdrum> I only use the JSON file for my nodes.
2011-10-04T16:32:07  <stackedsax> yeah, that's actually the json file I'm talking about

2011-10-04T16:32:42  <stackedsax> I confused myself a couple minutes ago, but the .json file in the bug is the one for the RC
2011-10-04T16:32:48  <nirvdrum> Gotcha.
2011-10-04T16:32:55  <nirvdrum> In that case, I'm not seeing the problem :-P
2011-10-04T16:33:10  <stackedsax> can I see what your json fie looks like, then?
2011-10-04T16:33:25  <stackedsax> because when I start mine up with no asterisk, the RC starts up with

2011-10-04T16:35:29  <nirvdrum> Sure.  https://gist.github.com/1a96f6dd2c3dd124e590
2011-10-04T16:35:43  <nirvdrum> One thing to note that will obviously be different is I'm still using the older grid 1 environment names.
2011-10-04T16:36:01  <nirvdrum> Ahh.  I think that would do it then.
2011-10-04T16:36:36  <stackedsax> what would do what?
2011-10-04T16:36:43  *** lord1234 has joined #selenium
2011-10-04T16:36:58  <nirvdrum> It would route through differently.  So I wouldn't see the same thing you would.
2011-10-04T16:37:01  *** delvis has quit IRC
2011-10-04T16:37:06  <nirvdrum> It gets handed of to a different processor.
2011-10-04T16:37:34  <stackedsax> I see.  The strange thing is that defining the same capabilities in the command line parameters don't add this asterisk
2011-10-04T16:37:52  <jarib> omg, it crashed again.
2011-10-04T16:37:52  <stackedsax> the command line and the json file seem to be handled differently

2011-10-04T16:41:57  <nirvdrum> I don't see where that would happen.
2011-10-04T16:42:04  <nirvdrum> I'll have to run through the debugger.
2011-10-04T16:42:30  <stackedsax> yeah, would this be happening in internal/utils/GridNodeConfiguration.java?
2011-10-04T16:43:37  *** kennethkoontz has joined #selenium
2011-10-04T16:43:58  <nirvdrum> I think it's coming from org.openqa.grid.common.Utils
2011-10-04T16:44:02  <jarib> rtyler: it's been a while since the last chromedriver release, you may want to try a snapshot build from http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html
2011-10-04T16:44:46  <jarib> e.g. from here http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?path=Linux/104025/chrome-linux.test/
2011-10-04T16:44:49  <stackedsax> ah, looks very much like it
2011-10-04T16:45:07  <nirvdrum> If I had to guess, it's doing it because the RC only responds to the normal browser launchers.
2011-10-04T16:45:19  <nirvdrum> Unless you've registered your own, of course.
2011-10-04T16:45:45  <nirvdrum> But the translation should probably happen at a later stage so the client isn't affected.
2011-10-04T16:46:14  <stackedsax> and RegistrationRequest.java is what calls that method
2011-10-04T16:47:16  <stackedsax> or if it should happen here, loadFromCommandLine should do the same
2011-10-04T16:47:23  <stackedsax> in common/RegistrationRequest.java
2011-10-04T16:47:26  <nirvdrum> Agreed.  They should match.
2011-10-04T16:47:43  <nirvdrum> And I think the client should be shielded from it.
