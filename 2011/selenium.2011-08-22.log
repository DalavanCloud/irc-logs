2011-08-22T00:20:00  <killa> hi there. I had some tests for rails in cucumber using capybara and selenium and all worked well. After upgrading to firefox 6 i have an error "unable to obtain stable firefox connection in 60 seconds". Is there a known way to fix this or ff6 is just not supported yet?

2011-08-22T00:28:55  <mydog2> morning
2011-08-22T00:29:36  <mydog2> anyone have a way to do a text insert that will allow me to invoke an onChange event?

2011-08-22T00:31:41  <Ajay_> mydog2: hi
2011-08-22T00:32:09  <krosenvold> :seen Ajay_ ;)
2011-08-22T00:32:10  <selbot2_> I haven't seen Ajay_ ;).
2011-08-22T00:33:22  <Ajay_> i have two machines , keeps on toggleing my name between Ajay and Ajay_
2011-08-22T00:33:42  <mydog2> i'm trying to figure out if/how to get sel to do a text insertion, as well as trigger an onChange action.
2011-08-22T00:34:51  <mydog2> after a few days of trying to figure this out. including firing up the IDE to see what it generates.. i'm not sure if this is doable..
2011-08-22T00:35:18  <mydog2> which leads me to thinking i'm missing comething.
2011-08-22T00:35:18  <Ajay_> krosenvold: i am going to replace  someObject.size() == 0 to someObject.isEmpty() , i hope everybody agrees for better readability
2011-08-22T00:35:44  <Ajay_> mydog2: why do u want to trigger onChange Action
2011-08-22T00:38:19  <mydog2> the page requires it.. >>    <DIV id='win0divCLASS_SRCH_WRK2_SUBJECT$69$'><input type='text' name='CLASS_SRCH_WRK2_SUBJECT$69$' id='CLASS_SRCH_WRK2_SUBJECT$69$' tabindex='31' value=""  class='PSEDITBOX' style='width:60px; ' maxlength='8' onchange="addchg_win0(this);oChange_win0=this;"  /></DIV></td> <<<
2011-08-22T00:38:57  <mydog2> the onchange performs some back end jscript that's required to get to the next page
2011-08-22T00:39:15  *** mcr_mfc has joined #selenium
2011-08-22T00:39:28  <Binken_> it seems the jquery onchange event do not fire in IE.
2011-08-22T00:40:00  <mydog2> Binken_,  - that for me?
2011-08-22T00:40:10  <mydog2> i'm running firefox 5
2011-08-22T00:41:18  <Ajay_> onChange Should be triggered whwever u enter something for "CLASS_SRCH_WRK2_SUBJECT$69$"
2011-08-22T00:41:37  <mydog2> but i'm not the only one with this issue.. apparently alot of people have posted the same problem..
2011-08-22T00:41:55  <mydog2> Ajay_,  - right.. but it doesn't...
2011-08-22T00:42:44  <Ajay_> is there any issue created
2011-08-22T00:43:01  <mydog2> i've seen postings where people have stated that moving to a different form item after the sendkeys should invoke a change focus which would fire the onchange.. it doesn't..

2011-08-22T00:44:45  <Ajay_> thanks :) , can you please create an issue with a sample
2011-08-22T00:44:46  *** davehunt has joined #selenium
2011-08-22T00:45:07  <Ajay_> you can use  JavascriptExecutor  to your js directly
2011-08-22T00:45:08  <krosenvold> Ajay_: I think that's fairly obvious
2011-08-22T00:45:10  <mydog2> when i used the IDE to see what it created.. it appears to use a ".clear" followed by a send keys.. and then the next form item .click()... which works if you replay the IDE test in the IDE.. but not if you run the same test code..
2011-08-22T00:45:34  <mydog2> Ajay_, - right.. i tried.. and here's where there might be user error..
2011-08-22T00:46:05  <mydog2> i created a paste of this if you can take a quick look to see where/if i screwed things up..
2011-08-22T00:46:17  <Ajay_> go ahead

2011-08-22T00:47:04  <mydog2> you'll see all the attempts i tried with running the js..
2011-08-22T00:47:34  <mydog2> i'm hoping that this really is user error!
2011-08-22T00:47:49  <mydog2> but others have had the same problem
2011-08-22T00:48:44  <mydog2> if i can get to a soln.. i'll post to stackoverflow how to do this for others..
2011-08-22T00:52:31  <mydog2> Ajay_, - does the paste make sense?
2011-08-22T01:00:54  <mydog2> Ajay_,  - hmm.. just tried something that was interesting...
2011-08-22T01:02:14  <mydog2> http://fpaste.org/IEav/   <<<
2011-08-22T01:02:33  <mydog2> addedd >>   driver.findElement(By.id("CLASS_SRCH_WRK2_SSR_OPEN_ONLY")).click();   <<
2011-08-22T01:03:09  <mydog2> which then got the processing "spinner" indicating the javascript/onchange or something appears to be running..
2011-08-22T01:03:32  <mydog2> but it stopped.. and the text wasn't inserted..

2011-08-22T03:27:10  <AutomatedTester> Ajay_: patch looks good except it looks like you may have used tabs instead of 2 spaces

2011-08-22T03:29:45  <krosenvold> I'm quite sure the failure is within the test itself (or rather a timing issue due to the asynch nature)
2011-08-22T03:30:08  <freynaud> krosenvold: ok. I'll be online all day today if you have question. The design needs to be compliant with all the listeners. That's where most of the fun comes from :)
2011-08-22T03:30:19  <AutomatedTester> Ajay_: there might be in trunk but since no one in the project wants to support Eclipse you might not have it

2011-08-22T03:31:12  <freynaud> krosenvold: the failure is in the test, but refactoring the registry, or at least doing a good code review is helping

2011-08-22T04:19:49  <sdlfkjsdkjf> Yeah, it's a bit of a pain; I created a "master suite", and then updated a load of test cases, but it didn't update the master suite when I changed the names
2011-08-22T04:20:03  <sdlfkjsdkjf> Which is bizarre because the names are not part of the "master suite" html

2011-08-22T05:16:18  <jarib> andreashaas: yes, but by that definition chrome is also using native events by default (e.g. some times firing "WebKit events"), even though they also have a "real native events" mode

2011-08-22T09:17:30  <rmcauley> I should probably mention that the way my code is abstracted makes it more difficult (but not impossible) to obtain that as part of selecting the appropriate option.
2011-08-22T09:17:50  <rmcauley> can be done, but if there's a shortcut to just getting whatever option is currently selected, I'll use that. :)

2011-08-22T09:33:50  <simonstewart> Glad to hear that you're on the mend
2011-08-22T09:34:01  <lukeis> lord1234: is that the full debug? why does it not show the move_to in the wire calls? and it shows the text get 4 times?
2011-08-22T09:34:20  <lord1234_> cuz i paused it prior to the move to command

2011-08-22T12:05:13  <BenGrailsGuy> yes
2011-08-22T12:05:51  <BenGrailsGuy> mainly... the goal is to enter input into a textbox, wait for jQuery validaiton to execute for that textbox, and then check to see if a validation message is displayed
2011-08-22T12:05:56  <XRayCulver> yah
2011-08-22T12:06:13  <XRayCulver> my team implemented a nice ajax icon for me to check
2011-08-22T12:06:14  <BenGrailsGuy> which requires me to invent a way of waiting for JQuery's validation function to execute
2011-08-22T12:06:19  <XRayCulver> that is easy to implement with jquery
2011-08-22T12:06:39  <XRayCulver> so i just wait for the ajax activity icon to go away

2011-08-22T12:50:54  <rmcauley> oh jesus it's even worse the web app I'm testing opens them up in a new tab
2011-08-22T12:51:13  <lord1234_> you want to get the entire page?
2011-08-22T12:51:32  <rmcauley> Nope, the actual page served up is text/plain.  As in it's a .txt file. No HTML.
2011-08-22T12:51:48  <lord1234_> element = driver.find_element(:xpath => "//body")

2011-08-22T12:52:11  <rmcauley> If Firebug is to be believed, your method will work in Firefox.

2011-08-22T12:55:14  <XRayCulver> jimevans: any idea why one machine with a slightly smaller resolution can't click on an offscreen item?

2011-08-22T12:57:01  <lord1234_> XRayCulver: i would point at the obvious culprit...screen resolution?
2011-08-22T12:58:06  <XRayCulver> yah
2011-08-22T12:58:18  <XRayCulver> why would that affect scrolling down the page and clickign on an element?
2011-08-22T12:58:33  <XRayCulver> a button element
2011-08-22T12:59:23  <lord1234_> did you define how far you scroll somewhere?
2011-08-22T12:59:27  <XRayCulver> no
2011-08-22T12:59:40  <XRayCulver> it works when i remove an extra toolbar on the 2nd pc's ie browser
2011-08-22T12:59:47  <XRayCulver> so that the button is visible before the click
2011-08-22T12:59:55  <lord1234_> stop installing Banzai Buddy everywhere
2011-08-22T12:59:55  <XRayCulver> its not scrolling down to the button

2011-08-22T13:00:27  <lord1234_> a 2nd toolbar?
2011-08-22T13:00:31  <XRayCulver> no
2011-08-22T13:00:33  <lord1234_> i'd consider that you have a bad reference somewhere
2011-08-22T13:00:34  <XRayCulver> i'm just kidding
2011-08-22T13:00:40  <XRayCulver> it was a default ie bar
2011-08-22T13:00:44  <lord1234_> oh hrmmm
2011-08-22T13:00:44  <XRayCulver> its by id
2011-08-22T13:00:47  <lord1234_> so not in the page, part of the app
2011-08-22T13:00:54  <XRayCulver> hm
2011-08-22T13:00:54  <lord1234_> ur testing in IE or FF?
2011-08-22T13:00:54  <jimevans> XRayCulver: there was a bug where the scrolling wouldn't work right if the element was right at the edge of the viewport.
2011-08-22T13:01:07  <jimevans> (in IE)
2011-08-22T13:01:08  <lord1234_> ok i gotta bounce
2011-08-22T13:01:10  <XRayCulver> that would probably be it
2011-08-22T13:01:15  <lord1234_> gonna have to try to figure my issue tmrw
2011-08-22T13:01:17  <XRayCulver> it was right below the edge
2011-08-22T13:01:23  <jimevans> I thought I fixed it, but apparently not.
2011-08-22T13:01:27  <XRayCulver> its 2.4.1
2011-08-22T13:01:45  <XRayCulver> i'm forcing to 1024x768 browser size
2011-08-22T13:02:16  <XRayCulver> and i know its workign for other items offscreen
2011-08-22T13:02:28  <XRayCulver> but what you said sounds like what it could be
2011-08-22T13:03:28  <jimevans> it seems the issue isn't fixed.

2011-08-22T13:05:27  <XRayCulver> ok
2011-08-22T13:06:31  <jimevans> i think there's a small region just above the window border that when the mouse pointer is clicked there is interpreted as a click on the border, not within the client area

2011-08-22T13:35:40  <kennethkoontz> AutomatedTester, suppose a user has all ports closed so webdriver can't connect to firefox, what would be the desired result? Exception? Closing of the browser than throw exception? Right now if you have your ports on lock down then firefox gets stuff, (firefox_binary.py). This is probably happening because there is an infinite loop going on as is_connectable is never returning true. So the 'while not self.is_connectable()'

2011-08-22T14:11:13  <Nogem> jarib: the set of errors I encountered previously was caused by a lack of 127.0.0.1 localhost being in my hosts file
2011-08-22T14:11:16  <kennethkoontz> AutomatedTester, Hmm, I blocked all my ports and after 30 seconds nothing appears to happen. Any suggestions? Also, shouldn't it close the firefox session as well? Perhaps through self.kill()?
2011-08-22T14:12:08  <AutomatedTester> i can add that but blocking ports is going to stop webdriver from working
2011-08-22T14:12:16  <AutomatedTester> so we recommend against it
2011-08-22T14:14:08  <kennethkoontz> The only concern that I had was that a user may have a strict iptables rule. With a strict iptable, when they launch webdriver.Firefox(), it will appear as if it is hanging.

2011-08-22T14:24:01  <jarib> kennethkoontz: where is it hanging though? i'd imagine the settimout on the socket would prevent it from hanging in that scenario
2011-08-22T14:25:52  <kennethkoontz> In the self.is_connectable loop. As is_connectable appears to never return true if it can't make a connection, as is the case with ports blocked. So then _wait_until_connectable appears to never return True.
2011-08-22T14:28:09  <jarib> kennethkoontz: is it actually looping or hanging on is_connectable?

2011-08-22T14:36:21  <kennethkoontz> jarib, It appears to be looping as the count is, in fact incremented. However, I don't think this is what I'm seeing. To be specific, self.is_connectable() will never return true. So it appears that _wait_until_connectable will never finish execution. Am I not seeing this correctly?
2011-08-22T14:36:23  <BenGrailsGuy> does anyone ever do checks to see if images overlap each other?

2011-08-22T14:37:21  *** chadkeck has quit IRC
2011-08-22T14:38:15  <AutomatedTester> kennethkoontz: it will return true, if it is connectable it wont go into the loop
2011-08-22T14:38:28  <jarib> kennethkoontz: when the count is 30, it will raise an exception (breaking the loop)
2011-08-22T14:38:40  <AutomatedTester> if it goes into the loop it loops 30 times and then raises an exception
2011-08-22T14:41:36  <jarib> AutomatedTester: though it's a bit weird that you just return false and don't raise if the browser has died
2011-08-22T14:42:31  <AutomatedTester> that *may* be a hang over from debug testing
2011-08-22T14:43:47  <jarib> it may hang for a while (or forever) on the first HTTP request in that case, if the port is blocked

2011-08-22T23:57:29  <mydog2> hey Ajay_ !
2011-08-22T23:58:06  <mydog2> Ajay_,  - not sure why the reorder caused a change... but it did..
2011-08-22T23:59:03  <mydog2> Ajay_,  still have an issue that i'm going to have to resolve at some time regarding cache vals not being present.. not at all sure why this is happening..
2011-08-22T23:59:26  <mydog2> i'm crashing for a bit now.. 28 hrs straight...!
