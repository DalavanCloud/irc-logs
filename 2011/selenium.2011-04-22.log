2011-04-22T05:41:59  <miker2> I made some changes to wrappedElement.js in the firefox extension but don't see those changes (more logging) when I run the tests.
2011-04-22T05:42:50  <miker2> What build steps should I run to get these changes to run under test?

2011-04-22T05:45:23  <jarib> miker2: what language?
2011-04-22T05:47:00  <miker2> jarib: I'm using the java client, but the change I made is in the firefox extension's JavaScript.
2011-04-22T05:48:25  <jarib> miker2: only way i know of is to make the changes in trunk and rebuild the jar (which includes the .xpi)
2011-04-22T05:48:50  <jarib> i'm not aware of some sort of dev mode outside of the Se tree
2011-04-22T05:49:42  <jarib> webdriver creates a clean profile for each firefox instance, which is why your changes won't persist
2011-04-22T05:51:40  <miker2> I think the problem is the xpi might not be getting built
2011-04-22T05:53:01  <miker2> ./go clean; ./go firefox should build it, correct?
2011-04-22T05:58:30  <jarib> yep
2011-04-22T05:58:40  <jarib> (or just ./go clean firefox)
2011-04-22T06:04:39  <miker2> it's complaining about libIDL.  Hopefully the 'brew install libidl' will cure that.

2011-04-22T07:20:00  <miker2> jarib: So how do the javascript changes I'm making get executed during the tests?  Currently I'm not seeing any of the additional logging I put in reflected in the javascript console.

2011-04-22T07:23:12  <jarib> miker2: i don't work on the js code a lot, so not sure what's the right way to do it
2011-04-22T07:23:56  <jarib> but if you use the artifact produced fro `./go firefox` when testing, the changes should definitely be there
2011-04-22T07:24:53  <jarib> perhaps try a   throw 'foo'   in clickElement or similar just to make sure it's running your code
2011-04-22T07:26:45  <miker2> jarib: that's what I was doing, adding logging statements at the top of methods to make sure the build was good.  Still haven't seen them in the console.  Trying the exception route now.

2011-04-22T16:41:30  <jarib> re r11843, i think it's because using the property provides some level of cross-browser consistency in terms of absolute vs relative URIs

2011-04-22T16:41:34  *** Archdude has joined #selenium
2011-04-22T16:41:53  <jarib> (property always returns the absolute URI)
2011-04-22T16:42:57  <jleyba> problem is <a href="#foo">asdfa</a>

2011-04-22T16:44:43  <jleyba> I rolled back the change in r12061
