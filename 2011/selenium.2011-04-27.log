2011-04-27T05:38:45  <RossPatterson> bebef_1987: You can indeed verify that background in Se 1, at least as well as you can in Se 2.  Neither system will actually let you verify the image (i.e., that it was loaded and that it contains what you expect), but if RenderedWebElement.getValueOfCssProperty() is good enough, well, you can always use JavaScript and selenium.getEval() in Se 1 to retrieve the page's background URL property.
2011-04-27T05:39:26  <RossPatterson> pythonirc101: It's getText(...element_locator...).

2011-04-27T06:06:50  <uwjweq> How to handle logins in selenium? Do I have to log in for each each testMethod?
2011-04-27T06:09:29  <barancev> there is ide 1.0.11 pre-build on bamboo that linked from several blogs, and people asked me how to get it, now it is available again
2011-04-27T06:14:19  <barancev> uwjweq: to perform basic auth you may call selenium.open("http://USER:PASSWORD@site.com/")
2011-04-27T06:15:11  <barancev> uwjweq: to perform other auth types you have to deal with native windows, selenium has no support for credentials at the moment
2011-04-27T06:15:13  <uwjweq> barancev: I did not make this clear. I did not mean http-auth, but my own login.
2011-04-27T06:15:50  <uwjweq> barancev: For every testMethod I have to login again sofar. It is very time-consuming.
2011-04-27T06:16:04  <barancev> barancev: to perform "soft" login just implement your own login(user, password) function and call it as meeded
2011-04-27T06:16:14  <barancev> s/meeded/needed/
2011-04-27T06:16:40  <uwjweq> So no way arround login in every single time?
2011-04-27T06:16:51  <barancev> uwjweq: if you don't want to login frequently -- don't logout :)
2011-04-27T06:18:07  <uwjweq> barancev: Logicaly I am getting logged out when Selenium is starting a new browser for the test. I just liked to know if there was a way arround.

2011-04-27T06:19:19  <barancev> uwjweq: why do you need to quit browser after each test? why not reuse the same selenium session
2011-04-27T06:20:26  <uwjweq> barancev: Thats what Selenium does.
2011-04-27T06:20:40  <uwjweq> barancev: I am using SeleniumRC with PHP-Driver.
2011-04-27T06:22:55  <barancev> uwjweq: that's what your test execution framowork does (PHPUnit, probably) -- find a way to start browser once, don't quit after each test - that's what you need
2011-04-27T06:23:44  <uwjweq> barancev: Indeed, I need to find what I am looking for. No big revelation in that statement.
2011-04-27T06:25:55  <barancev> uwjweq: read about setUpBeforeClass() and tearDownAfterClass(), at least you'll be able to run one browser per test class -- http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.6/en/fixtures.html#fixtures.more-setup-than-teardown
2011-04-27T06:26:15  <RossPatterson> uwjweq: Every time your code calls DefaultSelenium(), you get a new browser.  Every time it calls selenium.stop(), that browser is terminated.  If you want to preserve the browser across several tests, you need to create it at the first one and hold off deleting it until the end of the last one.
2011-04-27T06:26:50  <barancev> uwjweq: or implement your own browser factory class (or even setup a global var) to manage how to start and stop browsers
2011-04-27T06:27:07  <RossPatterson> However, keeping the browser open across multiple tests makes it easy for tests to interfere with each other, and that's usually a Very Bad Idea.
2011-04-27T06:28:14  <barancev> RossPatterson: sometimes it is no bad idea to allow tests interfere, you may find interesting bugs - customers don't quite browser after each action :)

2011-04-27T09:40:58  <jimevans> i've only been involved peripherally in the discussion. i really like the StackExchange format. i think that poprely applied, it can help the cream rise to the top.

2011-04-27T09:42:29  <jimevans> StackOverflow has been immensely helpful to me in the past, but the merger as conducted seems arbitrary and narrow-minded.

2011-04-27T09:43:31  <adamgoucher> as someone pointed out (and it follows what bret said) -- we have a branding problem. all over sehq says 'web application testing' -- with the renewed 'were browser automation' focus the whole site needs a redo
2011-04-27T09:43:45  <adamgoucher> and not just because we're part of sfc now
2011-04-27T09:44:57  <jimevans> well, my skillset is about as far away from marketing/branding as you'll find, so i'm definitely not the guy to take on tilting that particular windmill.

2011-04-27T09:50:17  <christophermcmah> I have a bizarre issue about getAlert and getConfirmation.  anyone want to talk to me about how those work? my code base may have shot itself in the foot.
2011-04-27T09:50:31  <keturn> *getwindmill.com's server cabinet starts smoking*
2011-04-27T09:52:28  <adamgoucher> or shot your foot? :)
2011-04-27T09:53:06  <adamgoucher> they override the js that renders the controls. which is why you have to say what you want to do with it ahead of time
2011-04-27T09:53:58  <christophermcmah> adamgoucher: yeah, I have a monkeypatched window.alert, so every time I use getAlert() or getConfirmation() I'm getting two exceptions, one "Confirmation not found" and the other "There was an unexpected confirmation!"
2011-04-27T09:55:14  <christophermcmah> trying to wrap my head around if there's anything I can do about it
2011-04-27T09:56:11  <christophermcmah> interestingly, Se IDE consumes the Confirmation, but it has a validation bug, and passes every getConfirmation call regardless of what args the call has.
2011-04-27T09:57:45  <adamgoucher> why'd you monkeypatch window.alert?
2011-04-27T09:58:06  <christophermcmah> no idea, I just found it that way.  it's a smell for sure, but I can't get it changed any time soon.

2011-04-27T10:59:08  <adamgoucher> just remember, rc is part of se2. swap out the jar starting with 1 and with one starting with 2 and you have technically 'migrated'
2011-04-27T11:00:17  <adamgoucher> (you just arent using any of the 'cool' bits that also came along with it)
2011-04-27T11:00:36  <AutomatedTester> with se1?
2011-04-27T11:00:40  <AutomatedTester> ahh but we are
2011-04-27T11:01:04  <RossPatterson> Understood.  I just don't see the value in a 1.0.1 -> 2.0b3 update for the RC API when we have a highly functional existing environment.  Now, when we start coding fto WebDriver API, well, that's the horse of a different color you've heard tell about.
2011-04-27T11:01:17  <barancev> jleyba: function hasText(line) is defined in the end of bot.dom.appendVisibleTextLinesFromElement_, and it is not visible when used in the beginning

2011-04-27T11:01:40  <adamgoucher> what he said
2011-04-27T11:02:07  <AutomatedTester> maybe we should have taking the Se1 backward compatibilty away and do the RoR approach

2011-04-27T12:07:19  <andytinkham> brnull: My take (speaking as a non-Se committer) is that Selenium 2 implements the webdriver API, but retains some of Selenium 1's back end which extends the capabilities of what was originally in webdriver some as well

2011-04-27T12:08:17  <brnull> seems like selenium-webdriver gem isn't mature
2011-04-27T12:08:24  <epall> brnull: how so?
2011-04-27T12:09:15  <brnull> according to the official wiki the ruby bindings aren't complete. there are features missing etc.. the current version is 0.2.0
2011-04-27T12:09:49  <epall> brnull: selenium-webdriver is the standard way to use both the WebDriver and RC Selenium APIs from Ruby
2011-04-27T12:10:16  <epall> brnull: Selenium 2 / WebDriver is still pre-1.0, so it's reasonable that the client bindings aren't yet at 1.0
2011-04-27T12:10:18  <andytinkham> brnull: I'm using selenium-webdriver in my suite. Nothing I've tried to do yet has been impossible (though I'm still building out some infrastrucutre before diving into tests)

2011-04-27T12:11:06  <epall> andytinkham: I'm looking for a few people to alpha test a new Ruby-based Selenium testing framework
2011-04-27T12:11:14  <epall> brnull: It will be more feature complete, since Simon cares most about it
2011-04-27T12:11:25  <epall> brnull: but if something is missing from the Ruby API, Jari is extremely quick to respond
2011-04-27T12:11:35  <epall> brnull: so use whatever language you're most comfortable in

2011-04-27T12:12:19  <epall> brnull: yep
2011-04-27T12:12:30  <brnull> I see
2011-04-27T12:12:47  <jimevans> i'd be interested to know where people find the .NET bindings lagging behind Java and Ruby.
2011-04-27T12:12:51  <brnull> do I lose anything if I use only webdriver API instead of Selenium2 ?
2011-04-27T12:13:03  <brnull> or there is no such thing..
2011-04-27T12:13:08  <epall> brnull: Selenium 2 has two APIs: The WebDriver API and the RC API
2011-04-27T12:13:21  <epall> brnull: The RC API is completely backwards-compatible with Selenium 1
2011-04-27T12:13:29  <epall> brnull: The WebDriver API is a totally new codebase
2011-04-27T12:13:45  <brnull> RC APi is JavaScript based in real browser right?
2011-04-27T12:13:56  <epall> brnull: no
2011-04-27T12:14:09  <epall> brnull: Selenium Core was an in-browser JavaScript runtime for "Selenese"
2011-04-27T12:14:27  <brnull> I guess I'm still confused.. sorry for stupid questions
2011-04-27T12:14:30  <epall> brnull: Selenium RC provides a way for any language to control a browser using Selenium Core
2011-04-27T12:14:42  <brnull> you have to admit the docs about selenium aren't good enough :)
2011-04-27T12:14:44  <epall> brnull: nono, keep 'em coming. The project is still confused itself, so you're not alone
2011-04-27T12:15:04  <epall> brnull: I'm using this as an experiment to see if I can even explain things clearly
2011-04-27T12:15:21  <epall> brnull: If you're starting on a new project, I recommend using the WebDriver API provided by the selenium-webdriver gem
2011-04-27T12:15:32  <epall> mostly we're keeping around the RC API for backwards compabilitiy
2011-04-27T12:15:34  <brnull> so you recomend it over selenium Java ?
2011-04-27T12:15:42  <epall> I recommend anything over Java =D
2011-04-27T12:15:48  <RossPatterson> brnull: The RC API does indeed use JavaScript in a real browser, but you write your programs in another language (Java, Ruby, Python, C#, ...)
2011-04-27T12:15:55  <brnull> I'll be using webdriver definetely
2011-04-27T12:16:16  <epall> in all seriousness, I don't recommend writing tests in Java because you end up doing a lot of ceremony for simple things. Scripting languages are much better suited to testing IMHO
2011-04-27T12:16:21  <brnull> as if I know right it has more capabilities compared to the old selenium1
2011-04-27T12:16:37  <epall> brnull: yeah, it can handle modal alerts better at this point and doesn't have cross-domain problems
2011-04-27T12:16:43  <epall> but it doesn't yet support Safari
2011-04-27T12:16:50  <brnull> also I like the idea of uniform API
2011-04-27T12:17:04  <brnull> as WebDriver is just an interface
2011-04-27T12:17:17  <brnull> has Chrome,IE,Firefox.. implementations
2011-04-27T12:17:27  <brnull> or I'm wrong?
2011-04-27T12:17:29  <epall> brnull: Selenium RC works the same way
2011-04-27T12:17:37  <epall> one API, many languages, many browsers
2011-04-27T12:17:47  <brnull> I see

2011-04-27T12:18:03  <epall> Selenium 1 and 2 support Windows, Linux, and OSX
2011-04-27T12:18:06  <brnull> can I easily use Selenium2 java/ruby on both linux/Win
2011-04-27T12:18:10  <epall> yep
2011-04-27T12:18:43  <brnull> can you give me some good place to read documentation about the ruby bindings

2011-04-27T12:20:18  <RossPatterson> (Still not better.  Never mind)
2011-04-27T12:22:10  <brnull> does Selenium/WebDriver support OCR?
2011-04-27T12:23:10  <epall> brnull: nope, not yet
2011-04-27T12:23:41  <brnull> so what are my ways of validating the screen?  Finding a given object (lets say a label) and check it's content ?
2011-04-27T12:23:41  <jimevans> and it probably won't. OCR pretty much falls outside the scope of "browser automation"
2011-04-27T12:25:09  <RossPatterson> brnull: There are some things you can't verify except by looking at images.  Labels aren't one of them - you can look at the DOM and see those.
2011-04-27T12:25:30  <brnull> I see.
2011-04-27T12:25:45  <brnull> what about waiting for something. Like a page with lots of AJAX you wait to be loaded
2011-04-27T12:25:51  <brnull> how does that work?
2011-04-27T12:26:21  <RossPatterson> But if you want to know if hovering the mouse pointer over an element displays its tooltip, well, that's something that takes an eyeball or some really cool screenshot comparator.
2011-04-27T12:27:12  <RossPatterson> In the RC API, you just: selenium.WaitForPageToLoad(timeout); selenium.WaitForElementPresent(locator, timeout);

2011-04-27T12:28:18  <brnull> how does it go here compared to Selenium
2011-04-27T12:28:28  *** marlena has quit IRC
2011-04-27T12:28:29  <brnull> there is some Watir-webdriver development I saw
2011-04-27T12:28:44  <brnull> it's also mainly ruby
2011-04-27T12:28:46  <brnull> ?
2011-04-27T12:29:08  <jimevans> watir-webdriver is the watir api using the webdriver technology to drive the browser.
2011-04-27T12:29:27  <jimevans> it's completely ruby.
2011-04-27T12:29:56  <andytinkham> epall: I'm planning to use win32-autogui for the gui apps, but I'm still working on making sure I can plug in the functionality first. Gui stuff comes in the next week or so
2011-04-27T12:30:06  <jimevans> s/using the webdriver technology/using the webdriver technology via the Ruby bindings.
2011-04-27T12:32:30  <brnull> jimevans: which would you recomend ?  watir-webdriver or selenium-webdriver ?  In other words should I use Selenium2 or Watir-WebDriver? Which would you prefer
2011-04-27T12:33:13  <jimevans> i'm not a Ruby user, so I'm not the right person to ask that question. However, it comes down to what API you feel most comfortable working in.
2011-04-27T12:34:10  <jimevans> In the case of Selenium using the WebDriver API, or using watir-webdriver, they're using the same code underneath it all (the WebDriver code)
2011-04-27T12:34:22  <andytinkham> brnull: My recommendation would be to identify a fairly short test case and try to automate it in both tools. You can have them side by side and see how the code ends up coming out differently
2011-04-27T12:35:02  <brnull> andytinkham: thanks, I'll be doing that shortly. Can you advice me to try another similar tool as well? How about Cucumber ?
2011-04-27T12:35:22  <andytinkham> My suite actually uses Cucumber & Selenium together
2011-04-27T12:35:41  <andytinkham> Cucumber at the top, a couple levels of custom built ruby code in the middle, and selenium doing the browser driver directly
2011-04-27T12:35:59  <brnull> so you get best of both worlds
2011-04-27T12:36:46  <andytinkham> I'm pretty happy with how things are going so far. :)
2011-04-27T12:38:51  <brnull> are you public? any link to a website?
2011-04-27T12:39:31  <andytinkham> If you want more information on how it's organized, the slides for my SeConf talk on how I'm using things are at http://slideshare.net/andytinkham.

2011-04-27T13:13:29  <andytinkham> reddevil^: My first (perhaps not particularly right) solution would be to use WebDriver to get the URL of the picture, then shell out to curl to download it
2011-04-27T13:14:22  <reddevil^> andytinkham: okay, this will work but I have to shell out the cookies too

2011-04-27T13:15:32  <andytinkham> reddevil^: If you have just the jpg open, you could try taking a screenshot from your browser (which is built into selenium) and save *that* off, but that feels kludgy

2011-04-27T13:17:55  <andytinkham> reddevil^: I suspect some of the problem is that the browser generally pops up a dialog box to get the save location, and that dialog is out of selenium's reach

2011-04-27T13:20:53  <reddevil^> well, the addon "webdriver" is used to interact with firefox. Couldnt be that tricky to implement a "save" function without dialog

2011-04-27T13:38:07  *** Mike_ has joined #selenium
2011-04-27T13:38:07  <jleyba> Simon once mentioned having an API like: element.sendKeys(new File("/path/to/file"));
2011-04-27T13:38:13  *** Mike_ is now known as Mike_k
2011-04-27T13:38:25  *** Mike_k is now known as kMik
2011-04-27T13:38:30  <jleyba> And the client would implicitly upload the file to the server so it was available on the test machine
2011-04-27T13:38:55  <jarib> jleyba: yeah, we've discussed that here
2011-04-27T13:39:12  <ato> You don't send key input to file fields, though.
2011-04-27T13:39:16  <jarib> i don't have any better suggestions which doesn't involve adding new methods to the API
2011-04-27T13:39:19  *** soc42 has quit IRC
2011-04-27T13:39:26  <kMik> Hi is anyone able to confirm for me whether ChromeDriver is working or not ? I have FirefoxDriver + InternetExplorerDriver working with Selenium as expected but Chrome simply goes to the 'ready' page and stays there. I read some discussion forums with some people experienced the same problem.
2011-04-27T13:39:41  <ato> Also, it's left up to web browsers how (and if) to deal with INPUT @type="file" elements.
2011-04-27T13:40:29  <jimevans> kMik: The ChromeDriver has been rewritten since 2.0b3. What version of Selenium are you using?
2011-04-27T13:40:32  <ato> To make the matter more complex, you also have different native style dialogues.
2011-04-27T13:40:34  <jleyba> ato: Right, so if you called sendKeys(file) on a @type="file" element, the driver would transfer the file to the server, then do the "right" thing to tirgger that upload
2011-04-27T13:40:40  <kMik> I am using 2.0b3
2011-04-27T13:41:08  <jleyba> kMik: Are you comfortable building from head? There's a new implementation of the ChromeDriver available if you are
2011-04-27T13:41:08  <kMik> Where am I able to get a working ChromeDriver ? Do I have to get it from the current trunk ?
2011-04-27T13:41:16  <ato> jleyba: I don't see where the sendKeys come in.
2011-04-27T13:41:30  <jarib> ato: what would you suggest?
2011-04-27T13:41:31  <barancev> all the tests passed for IE9 and FF3.6 on Win7
2011-04-27T13:41:42  <ato> jleyba: Also, that might be possible in Opera and Chrome which have native access.  But quite possibly not in IE.
2011-04-27T13:41:48  <kMik> Hi jleyba, I'm not experienced in that but I am happy to spend some time to learn how to do it if it is working.
2011-04-27T13:41:52  <jleyba> ato: I agree it's awkward, but it mainly comes from typing the keys to the file path into the file browser dialog
2011-04-27T13:41:58  <barancev> FF4 failed in CorrectEventFiringTest.testSendingKeysToAFocusedElementShouldNotBlurThatElement
2011-04-27T13:42:09  <kMik> I checked out the source in the past. It comes with some visual studio projects. Do those need to be built also ?
2011-04-27T13:42:16  <jleyba> ato: If you try to sendKeys to a file element on IE, it already opens the file dialog, types in the path, and hits OK
2011-04-27T13:42:28  <ato> jleyba: Again, it's left up to the browser whether to allow typing in file fields.  Most don't.
2011-04-27T13:42:29  <kMik> Or is there some way I am able to download a more up to date .jar ?
2011-04-27T13:43:17  <ato> jleyba: I think it depends whether we want to include automating the dialogues.
2011-04-27T13:43:33  <jleyba> ato:  We're going to have to (and again, already do in this case for IE)
2011-04-27T13:43:59  <ato> jleyba: In Opera we'll soon be implementing a dialogue API to click on native popup dialogues, but that won't be very generic.
2011-04-27T13:44:24  <ato> Because, I mean, this is not an area where there is (or necessarily should be) consensus among vendors.
2011-04-27T13:44:52  <jleyba> Agreed, but we still need a consistent API for file uploads in WebDriver
2011-04-27T13:45:07  <jleyba> Even if that means it doesn't perfectly fit how file uploads actually work in each browser
2011-04-27T13:45:29  <kMik> Also I think I found a small 'bug' in Selenium. The IEDriver.dll creates a CImage for taking screenshots. This CImage is only created with 16 nBPP. It should be at least 24 or you will get colour discrepancies compared to the real colour you would obtain from a screenshot.
2011-04-27T13:46:24  <barancev> go test_chrome says - The path to the chromedriver executable must be set by the webdriver.chrome.driver system property - how to do that? change go.bat?
2011-04-27T13:46:28  <ato> jleyba: I agree.
2011-04-27T13:46:35  <ato> jleyba: I haven't got a good proposal for how to do that, though.
2011-04-27T13:48:03  <ato> jleyba: Opera displays a “text field” like element which opens a file dialogue if you click it; Chrome just shows a button; Firefox does the same as Opera, but with some very strange not-allowed-to-type magic (not the same as disabled or disabling contenteditable).
2011-04-27T13:48:11  <jleyba> element.upload(new File("foo.txt")?
2011-04-27T13:48:24  <jleyba> Transfers the file to the test machine, and does the "right" thing for the browser to upload it
2011-04-27T13:48:31  <jleyba> Throws an error if element is not @type="file"
2011-04-27T13:48:57  <ato> How do you set the file on the file field?
2011-04-27T13:49:07  <ato> JavaScript doesn't give you access to it.
2011-04-27T13:49:10  <jleyba> left as an implementation detail for the individual drivers
2011-04-27T13:49:31  <jarib> ato: the problem jleyba is talking about is how to do this when the file to upload and the browser isn't running on the same machine
2011-04-27T13:49:31  <ato> Right.
2011-04-27T13:49:38  <ato> Well, as for API I'm happy with that.
2011-04-27T13:50:11  <ato> jarib: Aha, I see.
2011-04-27T13:50:22  <ato> Supplying a File object or STDIN sounds reasonable.
2011-04-27T13:50:28  <jleyba> jarib: That's problem (a), problem (b) is what the API would look like (what ato is talking about)
2011-04-27T13:51:58  <kMik> jleyba: If I want to get a ChromeDriver that will work with Selenium using Java, which part should I be checking out and building ?
2011-04-27T13:52:30  <ato> For internal builds we implement our dialogues in HTML, then they are translated into a graphical library in Desktop, which could be a way around it for us.  Or we could just tap directly in to the field and set it.
2011-04-27T13:52:44  <ato> Yep, I agree with you, jleyba, in that implementation wise this is trivial.
2011-04-27T13:53:09  <jleyba> kMik: If you have Chrome 12 (dev channel), grab the new chromedriver server from the downloads page: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list
2011-04-27T13:54:17  <jleyba> You can use it with 2.0b3.  Start the server, then it's just new RemoteWebDriver("http://localhost:$PORT")
2011-04-27T13:54:24  <jleyba> where $PORT is whatever you started the server on
2011-04-27T13:54:45  <jarib> jleyba: some previous discussion here http://selenium.saucelabs.com/irc/logs/selenium.2011-01-11.log (at 2011-01-11T06:54:26) and here http://selenium.saucelabs.com/irc/logs/selenium.2011-02-16.log (at 2011-02-16T03:30:29)
2011-04-27T13:54:49  <jarib> may be useful
2011-04-27T13:55:09  <kMik> Okay I will try that. Is there also another version that works for Chrome 10 ? The 2.0b3 seems not to work for that version. Or is the only option now to use Chrome 12 ?
2011-04-27T13:55:17  *** kylls has quit IRC
2011-04-27T13:55:48  <jleyba> You'll have to use the current ChromeDriver, which we're not maintaining anymore
2011-04-27T13:55:53  <jleyba> or use SeleniumRC with Chrome
2011-04-27T13:56:13  <jleyba> To be honest, SeleniumRC is probably more capable for Chrome 10
2011-04-27T13:56:17  <jimevans> kMik: yes, to use the new ChromeDriver, you must be using Chrome12.

2011-04-27T14:49:10  <jleyba_> I doubt that will happen

2011-04-27T14:50:00  <jarib> so what's the benefit of storing it as a session resource? why not have sendKeys() just send the file content every time?
2011-04-27T14:50:42  <jleyba_> I was thinking ahead to Eran's advanced user interactions
2011-04-27T14:51:03  <jleyba_> Where it should be possible to do drag-and-drop from the desktop

2011-04-27T14:51:38  <jarib> oO
2011-04-27T14:52:50  <jarib> how does this help with that?
2011-04-27T14:53:18  *** phdaemon has joined #selenium
2011-04-27T14:53:46  <jarib> the server would place the file on the desktop?
2011-04-27T14:53:53  *** charleyb has quit IRC
2011-04-27T14:54:42  <jleyba_> I guess it would have to.  Although not by default (so maybe there should be an extra param on the file upload)
2011-04-27T14:54:55  *** charleyb has joined #selenium
2011-04-27T14:55:35  <phdaemon> to ask questoins about PHPUnit_Extensions_SeleniumTestCase_Driver, is that here or in the PHPUnit channel? cause no one is responding there :(

2011-04-27T15:00:15  <phdaemon> Nvm, i see that the testcase class automatically instantiates the driver
2011-04-27T15:00:15  <phdaemon> <phdaemon> so long and thanks for all the fish
2011-04-27T15:12:13  <jarib> jleyba: i'm a bit ambivalent about the added complexity (new state on both client/server, but only for truly remote servers, etc.).
2011-04-27T15:13:00  <jarib> i'd prefer just an optional 'file' parameter on sendKeys
2011-04-27T15:13:26  <jarib> of course that wouldn't solve Eran's problem, but having webdriver place a file on the desktop does seem a bit out of scope..

2011-04-27T17:16:03  <testtest> anyone using python+selenium 2 here by any chance?
2011-04-27T17:16:19  <testtest> do I need the 2.0b3 jar file to use selenium 2 from python?
2011-04-27T17:17:53  <testtest> knock knock
2011-04-27T17:19:50  <adamgoucher> if you want to use the remote webdriver or remote control api then yes, you need the jar
2011-04-27T17:20:03  <adamgoucher> if you want to use the local webdriver stuff, no you don't need it
2011-04-27T17:20:14  <testtest> adamgoucher: can i run the firefox instance headless from python in any way?
2011-04-27T17:20:53  <adamgoucher> xvfb is what you need to look at for that i believe
2011-04-27T17:21:36  <testtest> adamgoucher: so I cant do it from within python cross-platform then?
2011-04-27T17:21:53  <adamgoucher> headless has nothing to do with the bindings
2011-04-27T17:22:34  <testtest> I remember that from java, one can run headless browsers
2011-04-27T17:23:02  *** cburroughs has quit IRC
2011-04-27T17:23:04  <adamgoucher> htmlunit is i believe headless -- but you said firefox
2011-04-27T17:23:26  <testtest> indeed, htmlunit is what i was using
2011-04-27T17:23:51  <testtest> can we do this using selenium+python+ <any reasonable browser>?
2011-04-27T17:24:53  <testtest> i still install selenium ide 1.1.0 ide, right?
2011-04-27T17:25:09  <adamgoucher> htmlunit is a pure headless one. for firefox, etc. you need a head -- but xvfb can fake a head
2011-04-27T17:25:23  <adamgoucher> ide is a different thing entirely
2011-04-27T17:26:12  <testtest> adamgoucher: i need an ide to help me generate some python tests
2011-04-27T17:26:44  <adamgoucher> ide does not currently spit out webdriver code
2011-04-27T17:27:04  *** Spanktar has quit IRC
2011-04-27T17:31:07  <testtest> whats the best way to write the webdriver  code in python then? any pointers to docs/tutorials?
2011-04-27T17:37:24  *** pythonirc1011 has joined #selenium
2011-04-27T17:37:49  <adamgoucher> by hand. webdriver is just a library. you still need to use py.test, nose, unittest2 or something similar as the runner

2011-04-27T17:37:56  *** sjmikem has joined #selenium
2011-04-27T17:40:12  <testtest> adamgoucher: where can i find the details of this library...i would like to goto a page, fill forms, login, test stuff...
2011-04-27T17:40:35  <adamgoucher> crack open the module and read the code
2011-04-27T17:41:09  <testtest> but isnt that harder than just use the IDE , generate python code and use it?
2011-04-27T17:41:16  <testtest> why would anyone use the webdriver manually ?
2011-04-27T17:46:07  <pythonirc1011> isnt there an automatic way to convert sel 1 tests to 2 == webdriver?

2011-04-27T17:56:00  <adamgoucher> there will be a bridge for remote control -> webdriver -- but its not available yet for python
2011-04-27T18:00:25  <pythonirc1011> i just installed the sel ide on my firefox 4, seems it doesnt work on 4?
2011-04-27T18:05:29  <adamgoucher> use the one from http://xserve.openqa.org:8085 -- there are still some bugs in it though
2011-04-27T18:07:31  <pythonirc1011> adamgoucher: i dont see an ide for firefox 4 there
