2011-09-15T01:23:00  <JoeA> hey all
2011-09-15T01:23:35  <andreastt> Ahoy there!
2011-09-15T01:24:00  <JoeA> Anyone got a few minutes to spare to help me with a googlechrome and ie9 issue?
2011-09-15T01:24:50  <andreastt> I think the IRC cardinal sin is to ask to ask whether to ask; just ask. (-:
2011-09-15T01:25:15  <JoeA> haha :) fair point - just thought I'd be nice  first:)
2011-09-15T01:25:43  <JoeA> I've just downloaded standalone-server-2.6.0, recorded a simple script for a web application - runs without a hitch on FF
2011-09-15T01:28:35  <JoeA> when I loadup googlechrome, I get   The error message is: Cannot convert object to primitive value
2011-09-15T01:29:04  <JoeA> I found some info on the jira site, but that pretty much is compiling the server (which I've not done) - anyone got any other ideas?

2011-09-15T02:33:31  <barancev> To avoid this error you have to start browser with an option that disables same origin policy checks:

2011-09-15T03:29:01  <simonstewart> Ahhh... using RC, then?
2011-09-15T03:29:05  <JoeA> yes
2011-09-15T03:29:06  <JoeA> sorry
2011-09-15T03:29:14  <JoeA> should have said that - just got 2.6.0 this morning
2011-09-15T03:29:18  <simonstewart> I'm not sure
2011-09-15T03:29:21  <simonstewart> :)
2011-09-15T03:30:04  <JoeA> I am thinking I may just force it,by putting a waitForText in after it
2011-09-15T03:30:11  <JoeA> but it's the first time I've seen this
2011-09-15T03:30:18  <simonstewart> It's always a good idea to put synchronization in
2011-09-15T03:30:29  <simonstewart> We've not made any changes to RC in 2.6
2011-09-15T03:30:34  <simonstewart> What were you upgrading from?
2011-09-15T03:30:37  <simonstewart> 2.5?
2011-09-15T03:30:38  <JoeA> clean install
2011-09-15T03:30:56  <JoeA> (well clean download of standalone-server-2.6.0)
2011-09-15T03:30:59  <simonstewart> k
2011-09-15T03:31:13  <simonstewart> Are you using a lot of AJAX on that page?
2011-09-15T03:31:31  <JoeA> possibly
2011-09-15T03:31:50  <JoeA> I'd need to check with the devs, but it is ia good bet
2011-09-15T03:31:53  <simonstewart> RC (and webdriver) should return when they think that the page is complete
2011-09-15T03:32:12  <simonstewart> In RC that means that it waits for "document.readyState" to be "complete"
2011-09-15T03:32:26  <JoeA> I'll put in a waitfortextpresent and try that - can't hurt :)
2011-09-15T03:32:33  <simonstewart> k :)
2011-09-15T03:33:01  <JoeA> when I launch rc with *googlechrome, I seem to be hitting a security bug

2011-09-15T03:33:51  <simonstewart> You may well need to disable web security
2011-09-15T03:34:02  <JoeA> error: Exception details: arguments -> , type -> cannot_convert_to_primitive, message -> Cannot convert object to primitive value, stack -> TypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value
2011-09-15T03:34:18  <JoeA> disable web security in googlechrome itself?
2011-09-15T03:34:26  <simonstewart> Yeah. It's a flag you can pass in
2011-09-15T03:34:38  <JoeA> even when using rc to launch it?
2011-09-15T03:34:47  * simonstewart appears to have totally broken his desktop machine

2011-09-15T04:49:01  <simonstewart> I appear to have broken a very large number of computing devices
2011-09-15T04:50:27  <stephend> with one fell swoop?
2011-09-15T04:50:30  <stephend> that takes raw talent.
2011-09-15T04:50:42  <simonstewart> It's a knack
2011-09-15T04:51:06  <stephend> :-)
2011-09-15T04:51:22  <stephend> simonstewart: so, additional datapoint re: session issue
2011-09-15T04:51:32  <stephend> simonstewart: saw it again, looked at the machine the build ran on
2011-09-15T04:51:42  <stephend> and it, too, had a modal OS X security-update dialog
2011-09-15T04:51:46  <simonstewart> Interesting.
2011-09-15T04:51:48  <stephend> at least we seem to have found one cause.
2011-09-15T04:51:49  <stephend> yeah
2011-09-15T04:52:02  <barancev> simonstewart: one of my clients have a complaint against 2.6.0 - he said click does not work on elements that are out of view (a page has the scrollbar)
2011-09-15T04:52:11  <stephend> which makes sense, given we stress-tested our Grid for two days
2011-09-15T04:52:12  <barancev> they have to downgrade to 2.5
2011-09-15T04:52:16  <simonstewart> browser and os?
2011-09-15T04:52:43  <barancev> win, ff
2011-09-15T04:52:52  <simonstewart> version?
2011-09-15T04:52:56  <barancev> (don't know exact versions yet)
2011-09-15T04:52:58  <simonstewart> k
2011-09-15T04:53:08  <barancev> just fyi
2011-09-15T04:53:30  <simonstewart> We really need to finish the implementations of wdIMouse.xpt and wdIKeyboard.xpt and get them into firefox
2011-09-15T04:58:08  <eranm> simonstewart, I agree entirely.
2011-09-15T04:58:50  <simonstewart> stephend: how'd mozilla feel about taking on owning the mouse and keyboard parts of the firefox driver? We'll be happy to donate two implementations (one pure JS, one using native events)
2011-09-15T04:59:03  <simonstewart> Feel free to ask us to do some clean up
2011-09-15T04:59:07  <simonstewart> :)
2011-09-15T04:59:48  <stephend> simonstewart: I can have automatedtester talk to a few key peeps
2011-09-15T04:59:56  <simonstewart> that'd be great
2011-09-15T05:00:08  <stephend> simonstewart: can you email us more details?  Or does David already know about it?
2011-09-15T05:00:18  <simonstewart> I can email more details
2011-09-15T05:00:22  <simonstewart> Or raise a bugzilla issue
2011-09-15T05:00:23  <stephend> perhaps Clint Talbert's team can look at it
2011-09-15T05:00:25  <stephend> yeah
2011-09-15T05:00:28  <stephend> that would be even better
2011-09-15T05:00:31  <barancev> I have found the primary issue with my failing RC tests for IE9 -- #2457
2011-09-15T05:00:31  <selbot2_>  open/new TestXPathLocators.testXPathLocators failed in IE9 due to non-breaking space issue - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2457 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium]
2011-09-15T05:00:56  <barancev> it is IE9 specific issue with non-breaking spaces, IE8 is ok
2011-09-15T05:01:44  <simonstewart> grief
2011-09-15T05:01:44  <barancev> and I suspect that RC in IE can get text from invisible elements
2011-09-15T05:01:45  *** ner0x has joined #selenium
2011-09-15T05:01:48  <simonstewart> Nice work
2011-09-15T05:02:39  <simonstewart> Yes, RC gets text from invisible elements
2011-09-15T05:02:44  <barancev> testGetTextContent failed on IE8 and IE9
2011-09-15T05:02:48  <simonstewart> Depending on how they're made invisible
2011-09-15T05:03:01  <stephend> like via CSS?
2011-09-15T05:03:28  <simonstewart> From memory, I think the display check done is just on the element
2011-09-15T05:03:33  <stephend> ah
2011-09-15T05:03:46  <barancev> testGetTextContent says it should not
2011-09-15T05:03:53  <simonstewart> Quite right
2011-09-15T05:04:13  <simonstewart> Really, I'm not planning on doing any changes to the RC and Core code unless I have to

2011-09-15T05:05:13  <barancev> well, it is hard to tell clients "migrate your tests if you need IE9" :)
2011-09-15T05:05:29  <simonstewart> There is that
2011-09-15T05:05:36  <simonstewart> So it's an RC problem for IE 9?
2011-09-15T05:05:43  <simonstewart> Is there a reproducible test case?
2011-09-15T05:05:44  <barancev> yes, it is RC
2011-09-15T05:06:09  <barancev> test case? I just run existing tests :)
2011-09-15T05:06:13  * simonstewart wonders if pulling _every_ vm on to his local disk is a smart idea
2011-09-15T05:06:26  <simonstewart> If there's a reduced test case, we can fix....
2011-09-15T05:06:29  <simonstewart> :)
2011-09-15T05:06:30  <barancev> I hope they are reproducible :)
2011-09-15T05:07:24  <barancev> I mean com.thoughtworks.selenium.corebased.TestGetTextContent
2011-09-15T05:07:24  <simonstewart> Sounds like it won't be too bad
2011-09-15T05:07:35  <simonstewart> Hmph. That's broken on Chrome too
2011-09-15T05:08:02  <barancev> yes, RC degrades with new browser versions
2011-09-15T05:08:06  *** brettporter has joined #selenium
2011-09-15T05:08:06  <simonstewart> Here's the dilemma: do we fix the bugs in RC and cause existing tests to break?
2011-09-15T05:08:21  <Ajay> yes
2011-09-15T05:08:31  <simonstewart> Because I've had a fix for "sendKeys" that makes it work properly on all browsers
2011-09-15T05:08:48  <simonstewart> I backed it out because the devastation of things _actually working_ was too great
2011-09-15T05:11:00  <Ajay> should we stop supporting Rc and some point ?
2011-09-15T05:11:08  <Ajay> * at some point
2011-09-15T05:11:18  <simonstewart> Good question.
2011-09-15T05:12:05  <simonstewart> And a hard one to answer
2011-09-15T05:12:20  <simonstewart> I'm tempted to break out a "legacy selenium" project at some point
2011-09-15T05:14:10  <Ajay> we give the users ample time to switch say a year from now :) we will be around Selenium 7 release cycle
2011-09-15T05:14:43  <simonstewart> You know that we'll be doing a 2.10?
2011-09-15T05:14:54  <simonstewart> The release after 2.9 won't be 3.0 :)
2011-09-15T05:15:08  <Ajay> He he

2011-09-15T05:37:29  <simonstewart> You can pass in the args via the BrowserConfigurationOptions in RC
2011-09-15T05:38:13  <joeA> is that in the docs - it doesn't ring a bell
2011-09-15T05:38:31  <joeA> i usually use java -jar <path to jar>  etc etc
2011-09-15T05:38:48  <simonstewart> via the standalone server? so you're running tests recorded in IDE?
2011-09-15T05:39:01  <joeA> yeah
2011-09-15T05:39:09  <simonstewart> That's trickier
2011-09-15T05:39:17  <joeA> record them in FF and then use the jar to play them back
2011-09-15T05:39:18  <simonstewart> And off the top of my head, I can't remember
2011-09-15T05:39:39  <joeA> :(

2011-09-15T07:45:37  <XRayCulver> so DesiredCapabilities.InternetExplorer(); needs to have something additional for version?

2011-09-15T07:46:48  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: I might do, we being me and Clint are thinking of a new approach for the driver

2011-09-15T07:47:17  <AutomatedTester> since Desktop and Fennec have a lot of overlap
2011-09-15T07:47:36  <simonstewart> andreastt: it means that people will be able to run opera tests by modifying a single line in a build file
2011-09-15T07:47:45  <andreastt> Oo.
2011-09-15T07:47:48  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: that makes sense
2011-09-15T07:48:14  <andreastt> simonstewart: With Opera 11.51 on GNU/Linux and the latest OperaDriver (in Selenium) you're able to parallellize Opera setting a couple of capabilities, BTW.
2011-09-15T07:48:20  <simonstewart> andreastt: the build infrastructure here is bloody marvelous

2011-09-15T08:21:45  <andreastt> On Windows, the autotestmode profile is being written to an admin-writable-only directory.
2011-09-15T08:22:24  <simonstewart> I also updated from opera 11 without doing a new download. Might that cause a problem?
2011-09-15T08:22:43  <andreastt> That shouldn't be a problem.
2011-09-15T08:22:52  <andreastt> Basically, installing Opera in your home directory will solve it.

2011-09-15T09:30:01  <simonstewart> Right. I'm going to configure this stuff
2011-09-15T09:30:31  <simonstewart> And it doesn't matter where the launcher actually is?
2011-09-15T09:31:15  <andreastt> Well, unless you try to do parallellization, no.

2011-09-15T09:52:41  <simonstewart>  We're using protobufs built from source here
2011-09-15T09:52:58  <simonstewart> And the snapshot of webdriver is a little old (2.3)
2011-09-15T09:53:04  <simonstewart> but it _should_ be okay
2011-09-15T09:53:16  <andreastt> I've had problems with different versions of protobuf before.
2011-09-15T09:53:47  <andreastt> But, why should this happen if launcher and OperaDriver are pre-compiled?
2011-09-15T09:53:47  *** ThePeach has quit IRC

2011-09-15T09:54:31  <andreastt> Are you using the protobufs library bundled with OperaDriver?
2011-09-15T09:54:36  <simonstewart> no
2011-09-15T09:54:40  <andreastt> Ah.
2011-09-15T09:54:45  <simonstewart> I'm using the one built from source inside google
2011-09-15T09:54:51  <andreastt> That's a problem.
2011-09-15T09:54:57  <simonstewart> in what way?
2011-09-15T09:55:02  <simonstewart> also, eh?
2011-09-15T09:55:05  <andreastt> 2.3 is incompatible with newer versions.

2011-09-15T09:57:04  <simonstewart> Would that work?
2011-09-15T09:57:20  <andreastt> Probably not.
2011-09-15T09:57:37  <simonstewart> What's the problem?
2011-09-15T09:58:04  <andreastt> The proto files in OperaDriver are written for 2.3, so if you try to compile those into new Java classes with protoc > 2.3, it'll fail.
2011-09-15T09:58:20  <simonstewart> Right.
2011-09-15T09:58:24  <simonstewart> We may have to patch that
2011-09-15T09:58:27  <andreastt> Also, there's no automated process for doing that.
