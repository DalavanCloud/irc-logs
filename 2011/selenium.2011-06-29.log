2011-06-29T03:54:36  <tomh-> hey guys, I tried building selenium but it failed with "No Gecko SDK detected. Install xulrunner-dev (xulrunner-devel for acports) to compile 64-bit Firefox extension."
2011-06-29T03:54:44  <tomh-> I ran go /dotnet
2011-06-29T03:54:52  <tomh-> why does it need to build the firefox?
2011-06-29T03:55:01  <tomh-> *firefox extension
2011-06-29T03:55:47  <Ivog> Isnt that just a warning message?
2011-06-29T03:56:15  <tomh-> not sure
2011-06-29T03:56:16  <Ivog> I think it should fall back to precompiled stuff
2011-06-29T03:56:25  <tomh-> it also sais this: 'pkg-config' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
2011-06-29T03:57:07  <Ivog> You're on windows? That shouldnt be a problem
2011-06-29T03:57:14  <tomh-> I'm on windows yes
2011-06-29T03:57:25  <tomh-> I only want to build the .net webdriver
2011-06-29T03:57:35  <Ivog> Firefox stuff is needed for building the ff wevdriver
2011-06-29T03:58:00  <tomh-> yeah I don't need that
2011-06-29T03:58:14  <Ivog> U should use go.bat dotnet by the way instead of /dotnet

2011-06-29T03:59:21  <tomh-> how can I exclude that?
2011-06-29T03:59:44  <jarib> tomh-: is your checkout up to date?
2011-06-29T03:59:59  <jarib> in any case, those are just warnings
2011-06-29T04:00:16  <jarib> you shouldn't see those on HEAD though
2011-06-29T04:00:53  <Ivog> What do u want to build exactly?
2011-06-29T04:01:20  <tomh-> the .net libs for selenium 2.0rc2
2011-06-29T04:01:30  <tomh-> since they deleted the binaries on the google code page
2011-06-29T04:01:41  <tomh-> jarib: I used the tag for selenium 2.0rc2
2011-06-29T04:01:53  <jarib> ah, ok
2011-06-29T04:02:41  <jarib> not sure why they were deleted - i see alpha 5 is still up
2011-06-29T04:02:45  <jarib> jimevans: ^
2011-06-29T04:02:55  <Ivog> Well u need ff for .net bindings because of the firefoxwebdriver
2011-06-29T04:03:08  <jarib> tomh-: those warnings can be ignored though - that's not an indication of the build failing
2011-06-29T04:03:14  <Ivog> Try go.bat release
2011-06-29T04:03:54  <tomh-> jarib: what does it say when the build succeeded?
2011-06-29T04:04:00  <tomh-> or where does it locate the builds
2011-06-29T04:05:20  <jarib> they should be in the "build" folder
2011-06-29T04:05:39  <jarib> it doesn't say anything special when the build succeeds
2011-06-29T04:05:43  <tomh-> yeah thats empty
2011-06-29T04:05:53  <Ivog> Try go.bat release
2011-06-29T04:06:02  <tomh-> what do you mean?
2011-06-29T04:06:10  <tomh-> oh the command
2011-06-29T04:06:22  <tomh-> running
2011-06-29T04:06:49  <Ivog> Yes that should result in dlls in build\dist
2011-06-29T04:07:18  <Ivog> Why do u need rc2?
2011-06-29T04:07:55  <tomh-> because the chrome driver doesn't work with selects in rc3 and rc2 contains a workaround that is broken in rc3
2011-06-29T04:09:02  <Ivog> Ah ok, got troubles with chromedriver myself with simple clicks
2011-06-29T04:09:11  <Ivog> :(
2011-06-29T04:09:31  <tomh-> yeah that sucks, the other browsers are not capable of running my code ;/

2011-06-29T06:49:30  <Zladivliba> hi guys !
2011-06-29T06:49:51  <Zladivliba> Could someone explain to me what you need to do to use *iexplore
2011-06-29T06:50:28  <Zladivliba> I setup a SE grid and all I get is : Unknown environment '*iexeplore'
2011-06-29T06:50:54  <jarib> Zladivliba: looks like a typo? iexeplore vs iexplore
2011-06-29T06:52:23  <Zladivliba> jarib, thaks. I still get this problem : Could not find any remote control providing the '*iexplore' environment. Please make sure you started some remote controls which registered as offering this environment.)
2011-06-29T06:53:08  <Zladivliba> I'm using the default selenium grid configuration
2011-06-29T06:53:19  <jarib> dunno
2011-06-29T06:53:21  <Zladivliba> I don't know if I'm supposed to modify anything
2011-06-29T06:53:39  <Zladivliba> jarib, did IE worked by default on your configuration ?

2011-06-29T06:58:25  <barancev> looks like IE driver became faster while I've been missing for a week :)
2011-06-29T06:59:11  <rpk> freynaud: yeah, I got moved to another project, so I haven't had time to write docs for the teams, so I've just been trying to point them at the google code wiki.
2011-06-29T06:59:34  <rpk> the grid2 page lacks instructions on setting it up like that is all
2011-06-29T06:59:50  <barancev> but I see a problem -- it throws exception when I click on a disabled chechbox. I'd expect it do nothing, just ignore this click, right?
2011-06-29T07:00:15  <freynaud> rpk: i need to cleanup the config for the node

2011-06-29T07:43:53  <Zladivliba> Ivog, actually I didn't ;-) I thought I needed to say iexplore7 or somehting. I supposed It'll work. My question is : how do you make the difference between a machine that uses IE7 and a machine that uses IE8 (i mean from the client point of view)

2011-06-29T07:48:53  <Zladivliba> freynaud, you mean selenium 2 ?
2011-06-29T07:49:00  <Zladivliba> how do I manage the grid then ?
2011-06-29T07:49:09  <Zladivliba> I'm very interested in learning this
2011-06-29T07:49:23  <Zladivliba> where can I learn more ?
2011-06-29T07:53:20  <freynaud> Zladivliba: if you'vr used grid1, grid2 is no different.it  manages different envt and make you test run in parallel
2011-06-29T07:53:22  <freynaud> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2
2011-06-29T07:53:46  <freynaud> the main diff are : support for webdriver, support for N browser per node
2011-06-29T07:53:57  <freynaud> and easy to extend
2011-06-29T07:54:40  <freynaud> and to use it you need to compile from the source unfortunatly. rc3 grid is broken if you use webdrvier nodes
2011-06-29T07:57:42  <Zladivliba> freynaud, thanks a lot for pointing this out it's great stuff. Great not to have to use ant anymore, and the possiblity to launch just with a java command is killer stuff. One question though : how do I parallel my tests ? Is this part simpler also ?

2011-06-29T10:42:52  <eranm> if it's of any consolation, I've just discovered we have to change Selenium's build system to download multiple versions of the Gecko SDK and re-build the binary components for each version of Firefox from 4 onwards

2011-06-29T10:43:56  <eranm> It is. Thanks to jarib though it's less painful that it could be - with his addition to the build system, we can download these SDKs on-demand rather than checking in everything into our repository

2011-06-29T11:03:25  <eranm> Pending recompilation, native events work on Firefox 5.
2011-06-29T11:03:30  <eranm> That's today's good news, I'd say.
2011-06-29T11:04:15  <eranm> jarib, would it be possible to generalize the bit in the Rakefile that downloads the Gecko SDK so it can be used for multiple versions of the Gecko SDK?
2011-06-29T11:04:34  *** tunabum has joined #selenium
2011-06-29T11:04:40  <eranm> It seems like we'll have to depend on Gecko SDK 1.9.2, 2 and 5 for Firefox 3,4 and 5 respectively.
2011-06-29T11:05:50  <tunabum> AutomatedTester: sorry to give you a false alarm last night with the rdflib... turns out my linux box (ubuntu 10.04) had an old rdflib installed on it 2.4.2  ~ which Graph was using a parser that was depricated... 3.1.0 has no issue and is using no deprecated methods. (maybe the pypi page should mention the dependency on rdflib?)
2011-06-29T11:06:11  <AutomatedTester> tunabum: good idea
2011-06-29T11:06:22  <AutomatedTester> i will actually update the setup for it
2011-06-29T11:07:44  <jarib> eranm: ok, so do you want to just specify a single dependency which then downloads multiple SDKs?
2011-06-29T11:08:11  <jarib> eranm: i.e. what do you want the dependency to look like?
2011-06-29T11:08:44  <jarib> i see we have this now     :deps => "third_party/gecko-2/linux64",
2011-06-29T11:09:28  <eranm> Haven't thought about it fully, but ultimately we'll need (For Firefox 32-bit/Linux) 3 separate binaries, libwebdrier-firefox3.so, libwebdriver-firefox4.so and libwebdriver-firefox5.so
2011-06-29T11:09:59  <jarib> ok
2011-06-29T11:10:08  <eranm> the first one depends on third_party/gecko-1.9.2/linux, the second one on third_party/gecko-2/linux and the third one on third_party/gecko-5/linux
2011-06-29T11:10:26  <eranm> And other than this dependency, the compilation lines will look the same

2011-06-29T12:15:06  <_cgp> Question: I'm testing something in Chrome. This works fine in Firefox. My "java" test app performs a "selenium.click('blah')" and it triggers a click event faithfully
2011-06-29T12:15:33  <_cgp> *however*, I have an event registered via an observe (prototype), which generates an ajax call
2011-06-29T12:15:47  <_cgp> for some reason, it appears to be ignoring the bound event
2011-06-29T12:15:59  <_cgp> I tried "fireEvent", but to no avail
2011-06-29T12:16:28  <_cgp> I wrote my *own* trigger event which is *VERY* similar to the one that's included as part of selenium's internal test script (in browserbot)
2011-06-29T12:16:55  <_cgp> and it works -- I think the reason has something to do with bubbling, but I'm not quite sure, as they are different enough as to make it difficult to compare

2011-06-29T12:59:47  <_cgp> Where selenium is of type Selenium in java
2011-06-29T13:00:06  <_cgp> but I think that basically is a wrapper around WebDriver (which is of type ChromeDriver)
2011-06-29T13:00:08  <antlong> thats selenium 1

2011-06-29T13:01:27  <tunabum> _cgp: you're using RC  (selenium 1's api)
2011-06-29T13:01:44  <_cgp> there isn't a single selenium1 jar in my java path
2011-06-29T13:01:50  <_cgp> not arguing, just trying to understand
2011-06-29T13:01:57  <antlong> maybe you should paste yoru test case
2011-06-29T13:01:58  <_cgp> can you use selenium 1 style stuff with selenium 2 jars?
2011-06-29T13:02:00  <tunabum> he is actually using se 2 ... just the different api
2011-06-29T13:02:08  <tunabum> yes
2011-06-29T13:02:19  <_cgp> *sad face*
2011-06-29T13:02:32  <tunabum> se 2 contains Webdriver api AND RC api (aka se1)

2011-06-29T13:02:49  <antlong> its not very obvious unless you poke through the docs or the code

2011-06-29T13:03:01  <antlong> jarib: yt?
2011-06-29T13:03:09  <_cgp> 1) how hard is it to switch over to se2 from se1 style tests
2011-06-29T13:03:28  <_cgp> I'm guessing it's not *that* hard given that the IDE still writes se1 style tests?
2011-06-29T13:03:29  <antlong> _cgp: in java there is WebdriverBackedSelenium which makes it easier
2011-06-29T13:03:34  <tunabum> not very... there's an interface to help migrate old tests: WebDriverBackedSelenium
2011-06-29T13:03:48  <tunabum> jinx :-P
2011-06-29T13:03:54  <_cgp> :)
2011-06-29T13:04:10  <_cgp> is it more reliable? -- this is not mean to be a knock against se1
2011-06-29T13:04:16  <_cgp> it's worked fairly well for me
2011-06-29T13:04:47  <antlong> se1 is more stable
2011-06-29T13:05:07  <tunabum> there's bugs... but it's fairly stable for most use cases now... some problems with grid in rc3... but every release is getting much better :)

2011-06-29T13:08:51  <tunabum> _cgp: webDriver talks to the browser through drivers (for each browser) RC talked to them through the selenium-standalone server.... what did you mean by push?

2011-06-29T14:05:48  * tunabum >_>   ....    <_<   >_>     anyone else think using "RC" to describe the release candidate was not a good idea considering Se already used that abbr. for something else... this chat channel almost seems like we have a 3.0 version of RC ;)
2011-06-29T14:06:44  <jarib> guess we just suck at naming things :P
