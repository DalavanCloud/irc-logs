2011-08-02T03:28:24  <ghostface_> Hey all, I wrote a very basic script:: http://pastebin.com/mNsCRYMm . I have Python 2.7.2 and selenium-server-standalone-2.0.0.jar running. Firefox opens with "WebDriver" in the bottom right hand corner, but it never opens the URL. Any thoughts?
2011-08-02T03:30:03  <eranm> You're behind a proxy?
2011-08-02T03:30:19  <eranm> Also, Selenium 2.3 was released yesterday. Always test with the latest version.
2011-08-02T03:31:31  <ghostface_> Aha, yes, I am behind a proxy. Just out of interest, is giving the proxy settings something I can specify in the script?

2011-08-02T03:32:56  <eranm> Have a look at the FirefoxProfile *java* class to see what are the names of the preferences.
2011-08-02T03:33:27  <eranm> As it's missing from the python implementation of FirefoxProfile. Of course, we'll be very happy if you decide to port it..
2011-08-02T03:33:37  <cerberos> AutomatedTester: Hi, you're commit for http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2061 fixes the boolean issue, however it won't do anything for the first problem where both single and double quotes are needed profile.set_preference("network.proxy.http", '"localhost"')
2011-08-02T03:34:05  <cerberos> Maybe that was fixed in another commit?
2011-08-02T03:34:17  <AutomatedTester> cerberos: actually it will
2011-08-02T03:34:33  <AutomatedTester> if you put a string in repr it will handle the double quoting
2011-08-02T03:34:52  <AutomatedTester> repr("localhost") => '"localhost"'
2011-08-02T03:35:52  <cerberos> ahh, I didn't know that. But hadn't notices the change from str() to repr()

2011-08-02T05:25:14  <simonstewart> https://twitter.com/#!/shs96c/status/98371475375005696
2011-08-02T05:30:54  <jarib> why are we not using error codes 26, 30 and 31?
2011-08-02T05:31:02  <simonstewart> I think we are "somewhere"
2011-08-02T05:31:07  <simonstewart> Or were
2011-08-02T05:31:16  <jarib> and do we need both NoModalDialogError and NoAlertPresentError?
2011-08-02T05:31:44  <simonstewart> I doubt it
2011-08-02T05:31:51  <simonstewart> At some point, we need to do a big old clean up
2011-08-02T05:31:59  <simonstewart> And that time is approaching fast
2011-08-02T05:32:07  <simonstewart> Got some google contributions to merge into our tree
2011-08-02T05:32:12  <simonstewart> then it'll be time to pick that up
2011-08-02T05:34:13  <dawagner> jarib: I'm in the process of unifying error stuff everywhere
2011-08-02T05:34:33  <dawagner> Adding an automated check when changes are made to the JsonWireProtocol page
2011-08-02T05:34:40  <dawagner> Because it's getting really annoying
2011-08-02T05:35:38  <jarib> sounds good
2011-08-02T05:35:55  <dawagner> NoAlertPresentError is disappearing, it's only there because I forgot to remove it.  NO_MODAL_DIALOG_OPEN was called MODAL_DIALOG_OPEN (alongside MODAL_DIALOG_OPENED) until yesterday
2011-08-02T05:36:11  <dawagner> So I didn't realise there was already an exception for what I wanted
2011-08-02T05:36:16  <dawagner> Removing now :)
2011-08-02T05:36:22  <dawagner> Either way, unification soon!
2011-08-02T05:37:16  <jarib> so missing alerts will return code 27?
2011-08-02T05:37:21  <dawagner> Yes
2011-08-02T05:37:31  <jarib> ah, they already do
2011-08-02T05:37:33  <jarib> ok, cool
2011-08-02T05:37:42  <dawagner> And should only be thrown by a call to switch_to

2011-08-02T06:32:51  <simonstewart> Hi boily
2011-08-02T06:33:24  <boily> I'm stuck with a little problem, sadly involving TinyMCE.
2011-08-02T06:35:08  <boily> I followed instructions at http://www.odino.org/325/typing-into-tinymce-with-selenium . Everything works fine in Selenium IDE, but when I export the test to Python 2 with WebDriver, I get a handful of comments detailing unsupported commands.
2011-08-02T06:35:24  <boily> Like 'focus', which is needed to make my test work with TinyMCE.
2011-08-02T06:35:55  <boily> Is there a manual workaround I can use in Python to insert text into TinyMCE?
2011-08-02T06:36:33  <simonstewart> If you're using webdriver, then break out the underlying webdriver object
2011-08-02T06:36:54  <simonstewart> driver.switchTo().frame("myTextarea_ifr");
2011-08-02T06:37:06  <simonstewart> WebElement element = driver.switchTo().activeElement();
2011-08-02T06:37:16  <simonstewart> element.sendKeys("your text here");
2011-08-02T06:37:22  <simonstewart> That should work as expected
2011-08-02T06:37:34  <boily> simonstewart: thanks! Trying it right away.
2011-08-02T06:40:26  <boily> simonstewart: thanks a lot! it works.

2011-08-02T06:57:24  <AutomatedTester> internally it copies the profile

2011-08-02T07:00:34  *** davehunt|away is now known as davehunt
2011-08-02T07:00:44  <nirvdrum>  Yo.
2011-08-02T07:00:55  <davehunt> I'm seeing the orphaned session issue a lot now
2011-08-02T07:01:06  <davehunt> Using 2.3.0
2011-08-02T07:02:13  <nirvdrum> Okay.  I'll have to back that out.  I'm still confused as to how it's arising.  What people are claiming they're doing and what the code's actually doing are not matching up.
2011-08-02T07:02:28  <davehunt> Before you do,
2011-08-02T07:02:35  <nirvdrum> Also strange that this has become more prevalent since I haven't touched anything in grid since pre-2.2.0
2011-08-02T07:02:37  <davehunt> I'll try increasing the timeout
2011-08-02T07:02:47  <Archdude> dawagner: hey
2011-08-02T07:02:51  <nirvdrum> The orphaned timeout is hard-coded to 5 or 10s.
2011-08-02T07:02:56  <davehunt> oh
2011-08-02T07:03:01  <nirvdrum> The other timeout has nothing to do with the orphan one.
2011-08-02T07:03:13  <davehunt> So one guess is that's too short
2011-08-02T07:03:43  <nirvdrum> I just can't see the situation where that happens.   Unless you create a session and then just sleep for 30s before issuing any other commands.
2011-08-02T07:03:45  <davehunt> FIrefox starts, and then the session is orphaned
2011-08-02T07:04:02  <davehunt> Perhaps Firefox is taking longer to start than tolerated
2011-08-02T07:04:41  <nirvdrum> But the orphaned check doesn't start until after a session key is retrieved from the node (i.e., after the browser has started).
2011-08-02T07:05:06  <nirvdrum> I'll take a look again tomorrow.
2011-08-02T07:05:12  <davehunt> In that case there's another issue causing sessions to appear orphaned?
2011-08-02T07:05:42  <davehunt> I've tried using 2.3.0 locally both sides of a restart, and on one of our dedicated Mac Minis
2011-08-02T07:05:49  <davehunt> Same issue every time
2011-08-02T07:06:36  <nirvdrum> Now, there could be a grid network issue where commands don't get routed properly.  And in that case, everything on the client would like fine.  And in that case, the orphaned state is a symptom of a larger problem.
2011-08-02T07:06:50  <dawagner> Archdude: You were having alerts issues? On which version? Trunk?
2011-08-02T07:06:52  <nirvdrum> But having not looked into that at all, I don't want to jump to conclusions.

2011-08-02T09:39:46  <XRayCulver> the version that came with the package

2011-08-02T09:45:04  <XRayCulver> that did the trick

2011-08-02T09:54:35  <XRayCulver> its not much of a change, just needs to specify the version in the reference in the nupkg file
2011-08-02T09:54:40  <XRayCulver> if i get a few mins i'll look at it

2011-08-02T10:07:48  <dawagner> Bleugh, I think a quarter of our defined exceptions are unused relics of the original IEDriver.  I'm going to try to do some cleanup of those at some point... Going to be fun tracking them down...

2011-08-02T10:08:46  <dawagner> XRayCulver: You need to set both How and Value (or Using or whatever the other property is called)
2011-08-02T10:09:07  <dawagner> If you file a bug on :newissue I'll add support for inferring from variable names if no value is specified at some point

2011-08-02T10:10:04  <XRayCulver> i'll do that
2011-08-02T10:10:17  <XRayCulver> the whole point of pagefactory is inferring from variable names ins't it?
2011-08-02T10:10:27  <XRayCulver> ID/Name
2011-08-02T10:11:34  <XRayCulver> i just thought of something
2011-08-02T10:11:50  <dawagner> I think it's mostly there to lazy-load elements, with the option of using your own policy for that loading
2011-08-02T10:12:03  <XRayCulver> .net with c# doesn't need pagefactory as much as java due to properties available for c#
2011-08-02T10:12:28  <XRayCulver> i can just set a property for the iwebelement that does that for me
2011-08-02T10:12:50  <XRayCulver> its still a bit less typing though
2011-08-02T10:12:51  <eranm> dawagner, just don't change the exceptions numbering...

2011-08-02T13:15:11  <jarib> when using text() it's finding the latter
2011-08-02T13:15:36  <sdimkov> puts "damn it.."
2011-08-02T13:16:35  <jarib> if you click the actualy image, that may work

2011-08-02T13:17:57  <sdimkov> jarib: Yep it does, I can see it. But still it's confusing. so I've selected the <a> without text but with an <img> instead  click() doesn't work. I have to select the image inside it and click it

2011-08-02T13:22:26  <sdimkov> jarib: Do you agree that it's still a bug?  I mean you should be able to do element#click  on any <a> regarding of it's content.

2011-08-02T13:24:23  <jarib_> Ajay__: don't know, I'm just assuming. I think dawagner has been working on multiple things before, he's probably a better reviewer than me
2011-08-02T13:24:45  <jarib_> sdimkov: agreed
2011-08-02T13:25:08  <Ajay__> jarib_: Thanks

2011-08-02T13:25:59  <sdimkov> jarib: Is that something I should submit as bug in webdriver or in the chromedriver project ?
2011-08-02T13:26:25  <sdimkov> I meant in chromium's project, there's no chromedriver project if I'm right
2011-08-02T13:26:59  <jarib_> sdimkov: does it work in firefox or IE?
2011-08-02T13:27:29  *** Ajay__ has quit IRC
2011-08-02T13:27:52  <sdimkov> jarib: Yes, and just but in Opera as well.
2011-08-02T13:28:49  <jarib_> perhaps chromedriver just needs an atoms update. i'm not sure if they use atoms for clicking
2011-08-02T13:29:33  <jarib_> are you using firefox with native events enabled? e.g. on windows?
2011-08-02T13:29:47  <sdimkov> jarib: 64bit linux
2011-08-02T13:30:13  <sdimkov> native_events are disable by default, I haven't tried enabling
2011-08-02T13:31:04  <jarib_> ok. so that means the synthesized click is working for this case
2011-08-02T13:31:04  <sdimkov> some hint what are the 'atoms' and how do they relate to clicking ?
