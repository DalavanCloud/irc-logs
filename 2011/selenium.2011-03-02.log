2011-03-02T02:39:22  <ato> I find that hard to believe.
2011-03-02T02:39:36  <simonstewart> But it is true
2011-03-02T02:39:55  <simonstewart> Turns out that HTML 5 expects a number of boolean properties to be present on elements
2011-03-02T02:39:58  <simonstewart> IE gets this right
2011-03-02T02:40:03  <simonstewart> Other browsers don't
2011-03-02T02:41:13  <jarib> the spec authors probably stole it from IE and put it into the spec :)
2011-03-02T02:41:24  <simonstewart> Probably. But it's there now
2011-03-02T02:42:36  <ato> But there are many cases in which other browsers to the wrong thing just to be compliant with IE, because (or at least they used to) they weren't likely to change.

2011-03-02T05:18:24  *** RossPatterson has joined #selenium
2011-03-02T05:18:53  <ahfeel> we're having really annoying issues (features and stability) with the IE tests since we switched from a7 to b(1|2)
2011-03-02T05:19:21  <simonstewart> Such as?
2011-03-02T05:19:31  <ahfeel> it's really becoming blocking for us, my colleague suggested to switch back on a7, but I would prefer to see if we could collaborate with you guys to get things fixed :)
2011-03-02T05:19:47  <simonstewart> And the problems are...? :)
2011-03-02T05:20:19  <ahfeel> well, we're having a very strange xpath issue with IE, By.xpath("//*[@name='foobar']") worked perfectly in a7
2011-03-02T05:20:23  <ahfeel> and now
2011-03-02T05:20:36  <ahfeel> we have to do By.xpath("//span[contains(@name, 'foobar')]")
2011-03-02T05:20:48  <ahfeel> of course when we do a single test page to figure out the issue, it works
2011-03-02T05:20:57  <simonstewart> That's very odd
2011-03-02T05:21:02  <simonstewart> Because the xpath engine hasn't changed
2011-03-02T05:21:21  <ahfeel> so it's probably due to a vicious state, but without your collaboration using our environment it may be hard to figure out
2011-03-02T05:21:30  <simonstewart> hmmm
2011-03-02T05:21:53  <simonstewart> I think that the xserve is creating nightlies
2011-03-02T05:21:56  <davehunt> simonstewart: sent.
2011-03-02T05:22:10  <simonstewart> It may be worth having a look at those to see if they improve stability
2011-03-02T05:22:25  <AutomatedTester> ahfeel: just curiousity, what arent you using By.Name instead of by.xpath?
2011-03-02T05:22:25  <simonstewart> There's been a few changes that might help
2011-03-02T05:23:08  <ahfeel> simonstewart: okay :) because on the stability side the webdriver server crashes oftenly using the b2
2011-03-02T05:24:21  <ahfeel> AutomatedTester: it seems that By.Name does not work properly with IE, and it's WAY slower than By.xpath on IE
2011-03-02T05:24:36  <ahfeel> (just repeated what my colleague says)
2011-03-02T05:24:45  <AutomatedTester> thats very interesting
2011-03-02T05:24:50  <simonstewart> Aye
2011-03-02T05:24:50  <ahfeel> (but I trust him 100% ;))
2011-03-02T05:25:04  <davehunt> ahfeel: What about By.css(span[name=foobar]) ?
2011-03-02T05:25:26  <simonstewart> davehunt: I can't help that this isn't actually fixing the problem....
2011-03-02T05:25:34  <ahfeel> simonstewart: +1;
2011-03-02T05:25:43  <davehunt> True, and By.name should be fast

2011-03-02T05:28:21  <simonstewart> The jvm crashing is a bad thing
2011-03-02T05:28:29  <simonstewart> There's normally a dump file from java

2011-03-02T05:28:50  <ahfeel> and gtailleb1 correct me if i'm wrong, but the a7 was really way more stable right ?
2011-03-02T05:28:53  <gtailleb1> haven't checked that
2011-03-02T05:29:04  <gtailleb1> yes it was more stable for us

2011-03-02T05:35:18  <ahfeel> ah
2011-03-02T05:35:22  <ahfeel> interesting !
2011-03-02T05:35:23  <jarib> so building trunk may fix your problem
2011-03-02T05:35:34  <jarib> or introduce new ones ;)f
2011-03-02T05:35:40  <ahfeel> hehehe true :)
2011-03-02T05:35:52  <AutomatedTester> ahfeel: new IE prebuilts were put in last night
2011-03-02T05:36:09  <ahfeel> AutomatedTester: huh, IE prebuilts ? what's that ?
2011-03-02T05:36:33  <simonstewart> ahfeel: if you're building from source they're the prebuilt binaries
2011-03-02T05:36:40  <simonstewart> So that you don't need visual studio on linux
2011-03-02T05:36:41  <AutomatedTester> ahfeel: sorry, we precompile the native driver because not everyone can and put into trunk
2011-03-02T05:37:44  <ahfeel> oh okay great
2011-03-02T05:37:44  <AutomatedTester> ahfeel: can you do a quick check by building from trunk and then we can go from there?
2011-03-02T05:38:03  <AutomatedTester> hopefully Jim will pop his head in then too :P
2011-03-02T05:38:03  <ahfeel> yes of course, it will take a little while but we can try
2011-03-02T05:38:27  <ahfeel> gtailleb1: I'm updating my trunk, rebuilding and packaging an SDK for your to test out
2011-03-02T05:38:38  <simonstewart> I thought that the continuous build server hosted some prebuilt artifacts
2011-03-02T05:38:43  <AutomatedTester> right, shower then food
2011-03-02T05:38:55  <gtailleb1> ok

2011-03-02T05:39:51  <AutomatedTester> ahh *reads further back*
2011-03-02T05:40:45  * simonstewart crosses fingers
2011-03-02T05:40:52  <simonstewart> I think my build might be about to pass
2011-03-02T05:41:48  <RossPatterson> Food before shower saves a cleaning step.
2011-03-02T05:42:02  <simonstewart> Food in the shower, however, is gross
2011-03-02T05:42:23  <simonstewart> Food as a shower is for fetishists

2011-03-02T06:07:53  <AutomatedTester> how did you envisage the code layout
2011-03-02T06:08:07  <AutomatedTester> e.g navigation.py
2011-03-02T06:08:19  <AutomatedTester> were you thinking of a actions.py
2011-03-02T06:08:21  <simonstewart> I just wanted to avoid one maaaaassive file
2011-03-02T06:08:24  <simonstewart> yeah

2011-03-02T06:09:41  <AutomatedTester> since __getattribute__ would have to possibly do reflection in a number of files
2011-03-02T06:09:52  <AutomatedTester> i dont think it really matters
2011-03-02T06:10:15  <simonstewart> I don't either
2011-03-02T06:10:31  <simonstewart> The webdriver-backed selenium is always explained as being an interim measure
2011-03-02T06:10:41  <simonstewart> to allow people to make an orderly migration to the new api
2011-03-02T06:10:57  <gtailleb1> Hi again guys
2011-03-02T06:11:12  <simonstewart> hi
2011-03-02T06:11:28  <gtailleb1> how come in get a WebDriverException instead of a NoSuchElementException when an element is not found with ie driver
2011-03-02T06:11:29  <gtailleb1> ?
2011-03-02T06:11:43  <simonstewart> that's not what should be happening
2011-03-02T06:11:53  *** cpg is now known as cpg|away
2011-03-02T06:11:59  *** melter has joined #selenium
2011-03-02T06:12:00  <simonstewart> It's likely that a JS exception was thrown
2011-03-02T06:12:04  <simonstewart> and we're not wrapping it properly
2011-03-02T06:12:44  <gtailleb1> in fact in some of my environments i get the WebDriverException, and in other environment, i get the NoSuchElementException
2011-03-02T06:12:56  <simonstewart> It should be the NSEE
2011-03-02T06:13:08  <gtailleb1> NSEE?
2011-03-02T06:13:14  <simonstewart> NoSuchElementException
2011-03-02T06:13:22  <gtailleb1> :) sorry
2011-03-02T06:13:30  <simonstewart> The webdriverexception (WDE) indicates that there was a problem actually getting the JS to execute
2011-03-02T06:13:43  <simonstewart> I suspect you're seeing it when your site is transitioning between pages
2011-03-02T06:14:13  <gtailleb1> hmm no the page doesn't change at the time i'm getting it
2011-03-02T06:14:31  <simonstewart> being updated rapidly using ajax?
2011-03-02T06:14:41  <gtailleb1> possible
2011-03-02T06:14:53  <gtailleb1> highly possible
2011-03-02T06:15:03  <simonstewart> hmmm
2011-03-02T06:15:10  <gtailleb1> is there a workaround?
2011-03-02T06:15:17  <simonstewart> I'm not sure
2011-03-02T06:15:27  <simonstewart> One thing to look at would be to use implicit waits
2011-03-02T06:15:42  <simonstewart> which will cause the search to be retried until a specific time limit is reached
2011-03-02T06:17:10  <gtailleb1> maybe i could ctach both exception, but nor very clean
2011-03-02T06:19:27  <simonstewart> http://www.buzzfeed.com/awesomer/the-single-most-damning-wikileaks-cable
2011-03-02T06:19:58  <gtailleb1> if the element is still not found at end of implicit wait, will it still throw the WDE?
2011-03-02T06:20:10  <simonstewart> It should throw the NSEE
2011-03-02T06:20:19  <gtailleb1> ok thx

2011-03-02T06:28:06  <ahfeel> gtailleb1: ping ?
2011-03-02T06:28:56  <jarib> AutomatedTester, simonstewart: I thought there was agreement that WebDriverBackedSelenium should be done in the remote server
2011-03-02T06:29:14  <simonstewart> We can look at it
2011-03-02T06:29:24  <simonstewart> every time I do, it terrifies me a little bit
2011-03-02T06:29:29  <ahfeel> gtailleb1: you can now use your local deps to selenium-java-client-driver=2.trunk
2011-03-02T06:31:13  <AutomatedTester> jarib: The way I see it is that it shouldn't matter which driver it works on
2011-03-02T06:31:27  *** gnofi has joined #selenium
2011-03-02T06:31:28  <AutomatedTester> you inject a driver and use the original API
2011-03-02T06:31:51  <AutomatedTester> so could be RemoteWebDriver or FirefoxDriver...doesnt matter
2011-03-02T06:32:06  <AutomatedTester> it gives us the scale up/down that we have in Se2
2011-03-02T06:32:12  <AutomatedTester> but am open to correction
2011-03-02T06:36:36  <simonstewart> jarib's point is that if we implemented this server-side we wouldn't need to write this code per client
2011-03-02T06:36:49  <balou> can you take a screen shot from a remote driver in some way?
2011-03-02T06:36:55  <simonstewart> Yes
2011-03-02T06:37:05  <balou> by casting the driver to something else?

2011-03-02T06:37:54  <balou> but what would need to implement that?
2011-03-02T06:38:24  <simonstewart> You can take a raw RemoteWebDriver and run it through the Augmenter
2011-03-02T06:38:41  <simonstewart> That'll return an instance with the additional interfaces added

2011-03-02T06:40:14  <jarib> AutomatedTester: the idea is to make the server expose both HTTP APIs for the same sessionId, backed by either WebDriver or Selenium
2011-03-02T06:40:26  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: when are we this to happen
2011-03-02T06:40:28  <jarib> then the client stuff would be a piece of cake
2011-03-02T06:40:46  <jarib> i think we decided on "when there's demand"
2011-03-02T06:40:55  <AutomatedTester> ahh right...
2011-03-02T06:40:56  <balou> 'run it through an augmenter'?
2011-03-02T06:41:10  <jarib> AutomatedTester: i have the backlog from this discussion, can email it to you if you're interested
2011-03-02T06:41:12  <simonstewart> WebDriver driver = new Augmenter().augment(instance);
2011-03-02T06:41:49  <balou> cool
2011-03-02T06:41:52  <AutomatedTester> sure jarib that would be great
2011-03-02T06:43:03  *** dmachi1 is now known as dmachi
2011-03-02T06:44:25  <ian_mac_> is Augmenter a standard Java construct?
2011-03-02T06:44:29  <simonstewart> Nope
2011-03-02T06:44:32  <ian_mac_> or is it Selenium specific
2011-03-02T06:44:32  <simonstewart> It's one of ours
2011-03-02T06:45:15  <ian_mac_> is it under http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fjava%2Fclient%2Fsrc%2Forg%2Fopenqa%2Fselenium somewhere?
2011-03-02T06:45:35  <simonstewart> http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/Augmenter.html
2011-03-02T06:46:10  <ian_mac_> thx

2011-03-02T06:48:55  <simonstewart> Debating whether I need moar coffee
2011-03-02T06:49:01  <balou> but the object you get back is a WebDriver, so how would you get the screenShotAs without casting
2011-03-02T06:49:11  <simonstewart> You'll always need to cast
2011-03-02T06:49:48  <balou> but casting to TakesScreenShot fails for me
2011-03-02T06:49:58  <simonstewart> Even after the Augmenting?
2011-03-02T06:50:01  <simonstewart> Which driver are you using?
2011-03-02T06:50:16  <balou> java.lang.ClassCastException: org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver cannot be cast to org.openqa.selenium.TakesScreenshot
2011-03-02T06:50:39  <simonstewart> Which browser? IE? Firefox?
2011-03-02T06:50:45  <balou> firefox
2011-03-02T06:50:51  <simonstewart> That should be working then
2011-03-02T06:50:55  <simonstewart> Furrfu
2011-03-02T06:50:59  <simonstewart> 2.0b2, right?
2011-03-02T06:51:03  <balou> i'm pointing it at a hub though
2011-03-02T06:51:24  <balou> yeah 2.0.b1
2011-03-02T06:51:28  <balou> s/yeah/no
2011-03-02T06:51:40  <simonstewart> Try 2.0b2
2011-03-02T06:51:47  <simonstewart> Or, better still, tip of tree
2011-03-02T06:51:55  <simonstewart> as I added a bunch of stuff to the augmenter yesterday
2011-03-02T06:52:11  <balou> how do I do tip of the tree?
2011-03-02T06:52:29  <balou> is there a maven SNAPSHOT version i could use or something?
2011-03-02T06:52:38  <simonstewart> If the build server was up, you could use that
2011-03-02T06:53:06  <simonstewart> The easiest way is to check out the code, cd into the directory and run "./go release"
2011-03-02T06:53:12  <simonstewart> which will build everything you need
2011-03-02T06:53:22  <ian_mac_> oh yeah?
2011-03-02T06:53:28  <ian_mac_> I didn't know that thanks Simon
2011-03-02T06:53:39  <simonstewart> The output will be in "build/dist"

2011-03-02T06:53:53  <ian_mac_> well
2011-03-02T06:53:59  <ian_mac_> I've never been in the Maven world
2011-03-02T06:54:01  <simonstewart> Which language binding are you using?
2011-03-02T06:54:15  <balou> so after you build it with ./go,  you'd have to install it to your local repository if you're using maven?
2011-03-02T06:54:22  <ian_mac_> me?
2011-03-02T06:54:30  <simonstewart> balou: yes

2011-03-02T06:54:46  <ian_mac_> well

2011-03-02T06:55:04  <RossPatterson> exit
2011-03-02T06:55:06  <ian_mac_> so write now I'm using Sel 1
2011-03-02T06:55:08  <RossPatterson> DOH!
2011-03-02T06:55:12  <simonstewart> I've written a ton of that
2011-03-02T06:55:12  <ian_mac_> obviously
2011-03-02T06:55:20  <simonstewart> But not for a looong time
2011-03-02T06:55:26  <simonstewart> RossPatterson: eh?
2011-03-02T06:55:30  <ian_mac_> I'm trying to understand how all the Java concepts work
2011-03-02T06:55:39  <ian_mac_> to hopefully port the Java client to PHP
2011-03-02T06:55:53  <ian_mac_> seems like a pipe dream atm
2011-03-02T06:55:58  <ian_mac_> but hopefully I'll get there
2011-03-02T06:56:00  <simonstewart> Should be pretty easy to do
2011-03-02T06:56:22  <ian_mac_> well there are some concepts that just don't map so I have to think about how those translate
2011-03-02T06:56:27  <simonstewart> I sat next to a PHP hacker at a hackathon and he threw together the skeleton of a PHP binding pretty quickly
2011-03-02T06:56:35  <simonstewart> Such as?
2011-03-02T06:56:46  <ian_mac_> I was looking at it last night
2011-03-02T06:56:48  <ian_mac_> let's see
2011-03-02T06:56:48  <ian_mac_> well
2011-03-02T06:56:55  <simonstewart> :)
2011-03-02T06:56:55  <ian_mac_> overloaded methods
2011-03-02T06:57:03  <ian_mac_> which I mean
2011-03-02T06:57:05  <ian_mac_> I can solve that
2011-03-02T06:57:15  <ian_mac_> it's just a bit of translation to figure it out
2011-03-02T06:57:21  <ian_mac_> classes in classes
2011-03-02T06:57:23  <simonstewart> Right, just use default arguments and away you go
2011-03-02T06:57:26  <ian_mac_> yeah
2011-03-02T06:57:28  <RossPatterson> Sorry, wrong window
2011-03-02T06:57:32  <simonstewart> They could be top-level classes
2011-03-02T06:57:35  <ian_mac_> yeah
2011-03-02T06:57:39  <ian_mac_> that's what I'll have to do
2011-03-02T06:57:43  <ian_mac_> but
2011-03-02T06:57:51  <ian_mac_> it just means it isn't straight syntax conversion
2011-03-02T06:58:05  <simonstewart> The end result is
2011-03-02T06:58:18  <simonstewart> $driver->navigate()->to()
2011-03-02T06:58:27  <ian_mac_> yeah
2011-03-02T06:58:56  <ian_mac_> so the PHP Hacker that threw together the skeleton - is his work anywhere? (or her work)
2011-03-02T06:59:03  <simonstewart> facebook
2011-03-02T06:59:08  <ian_mac_> ah
2011-03-02T06:59:43  <simonstewart> He's a good chap
2011-03-02T06:59:45  <ian_mac_> but the skeleton isn't available presumably?
2011-03-02T06:59:53  <simonstewart> Nope
2011-03-02T06:59:55  <ian_mac_> ok
2011-03-02T06:59:59  <simonstewart> Not sure if he kept it or not
2011-03-02T07:00:05  <ian_mac_> he
2011-03-02T07:00:24  <simonstewart> indeed.

2011-03-02T07:00:48  <simonstewart> Not sure if that means anything
2011-03-02T07:01:09  <ian_mac_> I haven't seen anything that will be insurmountable
2011-03-02T07:01:16  <ian_mac_> I think the hardest part is
2011-03-02T07:01:27  <ian_mac_> learning the Java concepts I'm not as familiar with
2011-03-02T07:01:49  <simonstewart> We're here to help
2011-03-02T07:02:04  <ian_mac_> so I can figure out how to do it in PHP
2011-03-02T07:02:07  <ian_mac_> thanks
2011-03-02T07:02:25  <ian_mac_> I started last night so still pretty early on
2011-03-02T07:02:28  <simonstewart> It's a pleasure :)
2011-03-02T07:02:35  <simonstewart> I'd love to see some good PHP bindings
2011-03-02T07:02:46  <ian_mac_> have you worked with any of the 1.0 stuff?
2011-03-02T07:02:57  <simonstewart> In the java world, yes
2011-03-02T07:03:03  <ian_mac_> but not the PHP bindings
2011-03-02T07:03:07  <simonstewart> Nope
2011-03-02T07:03:08  <ian_mac_> I assumed not
2011-03-02T07:03:14  <simonstewart> It really has been a long time

2011-03-02T07:04:10  <ian_mac_> well, Adam did some stuff recently
2011-03-02T07:04:23  <ian_mac_> and I took some of his page object base
2011-03-02T07:04:41  <simonstewart> Adam seems like a busy lad
2011-03-02T07:04:49  <ian_mac_> hehe
2011-03-02T07:04:51  <ian_mac_> indeed
2011-03-02T07:05:02  <simonstewart> Hmmm... I strongly suspect that the text handling in Core may be a little broken

2011-03-02T07:25:18  <balou> aah, so the reason i couldn't get 2.0b2 to work for me through maven is that the artifact id has changed from 'selenium' to 'selenium-remote-control'
2011-03-02T07:25:42  <simonstewart> Yeah. There's some "discussion" about that on the mailing list
2011-03-02T07:25:51  <simonstewart> Email sent
2011-03-02T07:25:55  <simonstewart> Finally
2011-03-02T07:27:38  <balou> so even with 2.0b2 i'm still getting ClassCastException, when trying ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
2011-03-02T07:28:15  <balou> I think i must be doing something wrong... I do  new Augmenter().augment(driver); in my setUp() method, is that what's expected?
2011-03-02T07:28:26  <adamgoucher> re php drivers - the person who 'should' do them i think is sebastian. and/or whomever does them contributes them to phpunit
2011-03-02T07:28:56  <adamgoucher> the pear selenium library has a couple truck-size holes in it and it doesnt seem too actively maintained
2011-03-02T07:29:14  <adamgoucher> (i use it though as i dont like all the magic phpunit does)

2011-03-02T07:35:53  <simonstewart> so:
2011-03-02T07:36:01  <simonstewart> driver = new Augmenter().augument(driver);
2011-03-02T07:36:30  <balou> oh of course, because just the copy is being changed otherwise?
2011-03-02T07:36:53  <simonstewart> We create a subclass with the right interfaces and return that
2011-03-02T07:37:12  <simonstewart> The changes I made yesterday decant the values of the fields of the existing class into the new instance

2011-03-02T07:38:34  <ian_mac_> adamgoucher - this seems somewhat separate from PHPUnit though
2011-03-02T07:38:41  <ian_mac_> I mean, it is nice that PHPUnit has them
2011-03-02T07:39:03  <adamgoucher> does anyone use anything else for creating xunit scripts in php?
2011-03-02T07:39:23  <ian_mac_> but none of the other test frameworks are building client bindings for Selenium are they?
2011-03-02T07:39:28  <ian_mac_> (I could be wrong on this)
2011-03-02T07:40:14  <adamgoucher> other languages have an array of drivers
2011-03-02T07:40:35  <adamgoucher> erm, runners
2011-03-02T07:41:22  <adamgoucher> but that isnt to say that you couldnt create your own webdriver pear package
2011-03-02T07:41:24  <ian_mac_> anyway, even so, I don't know that Sebastian intends to write them
2011-03-02T07:41:31  <ian_mac_> or when
2011-03-02T07:41:38  <adamgoucher> just dont use the the crap pear bug tracker please :)
2011-03-02T07:41:40  <ian_mac_> so it seems to me that if I want to use it, I need to write it
2011-03-02T07:41:55  <adamgoucher> i dont think he is; though i havent talked to him much about it
2011-03-02T07:41:58  <ian_mac_> and if I produce something
2011-03-02T07:42:07  <ian_mac_> I'd be happy to contribute it wherever it was wanted
2011-03-02T07:42:23  <ian_mac_> be that Selenium or PHPUnit
2011-03-02T07:42:25  <ian_mac_> *shrug*
2011-03-02T07:42:53  <ian_mac_> what tracker do you like?
2011-03-02T07:44:12  <adamgoucher> not pear. tried to log a bug in it and it kept rejecting it for dumb reasons :)
2011-03-02T07:44:23  <ian_mac_> he
2011-03-02T07:44:30  <ian_mac_> our tracker is probably worse

2011-03-02T08:02:37  <XCulver> i'm hoping that if i push a profile in there it would get rid of my error
2011-03-02T08:02:43  <AutomatedTester> any objects to me either making the private constructor in ChromeDriver public
2011-03-02T08:02:57  <AutomatedTester> or creating a new public on that delegates to the private one?
2011-03-02T08:03:39  <jimevans> Hang on, let me look at the backlog and the code.
2011-03-02T08:03:48  <AutomatedTester> sure
2011-03-02T08:04:13  <XCulver> AutomatedTester: do you think creating it with a default profile will fix my error?

2011-03-02T08:04:39  <XCulver> i have a big post on it
2011-03-02T08:04:49  <XCulver> essentially chrome closes when called by nunit
2011-03-02T08:04:55  <XCulver> says can't find profile
2011-03-02T08:05:55  <balou> how come Augmenter().augment(RemoteDriver) doesn't return a RemoteDriver?
2011-03-02T08:05:56  <XCulver> hudson fires my slave which runs a msbuild task, after building it feeds the tests to the nunit_console
2011-03-02T08:06:21  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: what I was thinking is add new constructor to allow people to pass in a ChromeProfile object
2011-03-02T08:07:30  <AutomatedTester> XCulver: what happens when you run this without all the other stuff you have
2011-03-02T08:07:31  <ian_mac_> balou it looks like it should
2011-03-02T08:07:36  <AutomatedTester> just a quick test that does it all

2011-03-02T08:08:38  <XCulver> AutomatedTester: Like just opening nunit and loading the assembley manually?

2011-03-02T08:08:49  <XCulver> let me try
2011-03-02T08:08:51  <XCulver> and good to know
2011-03-02T08:08:55  <XCulver> i'm ok for now
2011-03-02T08:09:01  <XCulver> i just tests firefox and ie
2011-03-02T08:09:04  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: I know that's why I dont want to do more than this :)
2011-03-02T08:09:36  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: My point exactly.
2011-03-02T08:10:41  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: but if we allow people to programmitcally create a profile then hopefully we can extend this relatively easily
2011-03-02T08:11:36  <jimevans> We have a constructor like that for Firefox, so I guess it makes sense to expose one for Chrome too.
2011-03-02T08:11:55  <AutomatedTester> yay...touching .NET code again
2011-03-02T08:12:12  * jimevans will be really glad to refactor the .NET Chrome driver so it's not such a big kludge
2011-03-02T08:12:23  <XCulver> AutomatedTester: it acts the same.  It doesn't report the profile error, only the object not found selenium error.
2011-03-02T08:12:44  <XCulver> It opens up the chrome driver, then opens up a 2nd tab for the page
2011-03-02T08:12:53  <XCulver> then it closes chrome alltogether, then opens it up once more
2011-03-02T08:12:58  <XCulver> then the test crashes
2011-03-02T08:13:12  <AutomatedTester> by Selenium error you mean....

2011-03-02T08:13:59  <XCulver> and it wont because the page is blank
2011-03-02T08:14:11  <AutomatedTester> is the profile error gone though?
2011-03-02T08:14:26  <XCulver> the profile error never appears on the page
2011-03-02T08:14:41  <XCulver> the only place i catch it is the msbuild console output

2011-03-02T08:15:33  <jimevans> XCulver: The logging you're seeing in the console is from the Chrome extension that gets loaded by the browser.
2011-03-02T08:15:44  <AutomatedTester> XCulver: create a test that creates chrome in it, in a new project,  and see if you get that error

2011-03-02T08:39:44  <AutomatedTester> is msbuild calling nunit?
2011-03-02T08:39:48  <XCulver> yes

2011-03-02T08:40:19  <XCulver> they can
2011-03-02T08:40:26  <AutomatedTester> sure?

2011-03-02T08:40:59  <AutomatedTester> I am meaning your dll that is built cant read the file

2011-03-02T08:41:58  <XCulver> right
2011-03-02T08:42:04  <XCulver> if the dll doens't exist
2011-03-02T08:42:09  <XCulver> it can't even load the driver at all
2011-03-02T08:42:18  <XCulver> err
2011-03-02T08:42:19  <XCulver> the config

2011-03-02T08:42:51  <XCulver> i'm lost on your original question
2011-03-02T08:43:15  *** antlong has quit IRC
2011-03-02T08:43:20  <AutomatedTester> ok, are you sure that .NET class libraries can read app.config?
2011-03-02T08:43:26  <XCulver> yes
2011-03-02T08:43:33  <AutomatedTester> thats new
2011-03-02T08:43:45  <AutomatedTester> they never used to be able to
2011-03-02T08:43:52  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: I'm pretty sure that's been the case for awhile now.
2011-03-02T08:44:02  <XCulver> the app.config gets renamed to the assemblyname.config in the debug folder
2011-03-02T08:44:29  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: hmm last time I tried you couldnt
2011-03-02T08:44:57  <AutomatedTester> the way to get around this for tests is to name the app.config the same as your class libraruy
2011-03-02T08:45:04  <AutomatedTester> and the same with the .nunit file
2011-03-02T08:45:15  <AutomatedTester> and then NUnit does the app.config loading for you
2011-03-02T08:45:29  <AutomatedTester> well thats the only way I could ever get it to work
2011-03-02T08:45:47  <XCulver> visual studio does that for you
2011-03-02T08:46:00  <XCulver> the rename of the app.config
2011-03-02T08:46:17  <AutomatedTester> XCulver: I dont know what your issue is then
2011-03-02T08:46:19  <XCulver> or msbuilddoes
2011-03-02T08:46:25  <XCulver> ok
2011-03-02T08:46:40  <XCulver> headscratching due to IE and firefox workign right
2011-03-02T08:46:42  <AutomatedTester> XCulver: our .NET code used to do what I just described
2011-03-02T08:46:57  <AutomatedTester> as in the Se project
2011-03-02T08:46:57  <XCulver> ah
2011-03-02T08:47:23  <AutomatedTester> but I hardly touch .NET now
2011-03-02T08:47:56  <XCulver> i see, Thanks for trying
2011-03-02T08:48:07  <XCulver> I feel like i'm missing something

2011-03-02T08:48:28  <AutomatedTester> i saw that type of error before when I did in September last year and thats how I fixed it...
2011-03-02T08:48:48  <AutomatedTester> but if your build does the magic then not sure without debugging the code myself
2011-03-02T08:49:25  <AutomatedTester> soz :(
2011-03-02T08:49:36  <XCulver> makes sense, the thing that bugs me, is when i go look for that file that the error lists, it doens't exist, so why is chrome trying to load a profile that doesnt' exist?
2011-03-02T08:51:21  <antlong> XCulver, the code that makes the profile is likely not being ran

2011-03-02T08:52:04  <XCulver> they are looking into adding it
2011-03-02T08:52:55  <antlong> if you set a hard path, it would likely work
2011-03-02T08:53:49  <AutomatedTester> XCulver: lemme put the new constructor in for you and then try it with the code from trunk
2011-03-02T08:54:21  <XCulver> ok
2011-03-02T08:54:28  <XCulver> i'll update and compile on my end
2011-03-02T08:55:25  <jimevans> XCulver: the reason it looks like the profile doesn't exist may be explainable. Look in ChromeBinary.cs, around line 171

2011-03-02T08:58:49  <AutomatedTester> or have totally missed something...
2011-03-02T08:59:53  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: I admit, I'm distracted by other issues at the moment and haven't been walking through the code with the care I ordinarily might.
2011-03-02T09:00:20  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: np, I thought I had drifted off and missed something so was checking

2011-03-02T09:01:09  <AutomatedTester> and somehow is losing the profile in the process
2011-03-02T09:01:58  <AutomatedTester> but wouldnt argue with the Chuck Norris of the Se team
2011-03-02T09:02:05  <AutomatedTester> ^ jimevans
2011-03-02T09:02:23  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: I loved the tweet yesterday
2011-03-02T09:02:23  <jimevans> You beat me to it. I was going to point out that anywhere ChromeCommandExecutor.Stop() is called, you'll get the profile deleted.
2011-03-02T09:02:46  <jimevans> heh. The Wife is loving the whole Chuck Norris thing. A little too much, if you ask me.
2011-03-02T09:02:48  <jimevans> :)
2011-03-02T09:03:12  <XCulver> hah
2011-03-02T09:03:13  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: I should have followed the code around...
2011-03-02T09:03:16  <XCulver> nice catch jim
2011-03-02T09:03:48  <jimevans> As it happens, ChromeCommandExecutor.Start() will call .Stop() if there is no client connection.
2011-03-02T09:03:51  <AutomatedTester> the stop/start issue *should* be fixed with the rewrite
2011-03-02T09:04:03  <XCulver> works perfect then
2011-03-02T09:04:07  <XCulver> i can wait for the rewrite
2011-03-02T09:04:10  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: I have seen times where it lies and kills the browser

2011-03-02T09:15:48  <andytinkham> Actually, I do have a question though. I've got 2 parallel efforts under way - one to get an iPad set up to run my Se2 tests and one to get my tests access to our databases (all MS Sql Server).
2011-03-02T09:16:23  <andytinkham> It's looking like I'll need separate connection logic for OS X and Windows. My assumption is that the iPad is driven remotely from the mac, so I don't need separate connection logic for iOS as well. Is this a valid assumption?
2011-03-02T09:16:51  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-03-02T09:17:20  <ian_mac_> I would have assumed you run the server directly on the iPad, but that's just a guess
2011-03-02T09:17:51  <simonstewart> The iWebDriver.app includes the http server
2011-03-02T09:17:56  <simonstewart> You need logic to start the simulator
2011-03-02T09:18:06  <simonstewart> Or install on an actual device
2011-03-02T09:18:44  <andytinkham> My goal is probably to use both the simulator and real devices (waiting on Apple for the real device support at the moment). I've seen the Selenium app in the iOS simulator but haven't run any of my tests there yet

2011-03-02T09:19:31  <andytinkham> But I thought that the actual Ruby code that makes up the tests wouldn't be pushed to the iOS device/simulator, so my db connection code should stay with that code
2011-03-02T09:20:34  <ian_mac_> that is correct
2011-03-02T09:21:16  <ian_mac_> your Ruby code runs and talks to the Selenium server on your iPad
2011-03-02T09:21:33  <andytinkham> OK, so then, I think, I don't need to differentiate between test running on a browser in OS X versus test running on an iPad connected to OS X for the purposes of handling querying our SQL Servers
2011-03-02T09:21:54  <ian_mac_> what queries the SQL servers?
2011-03-02T09:22:24  <ian_mac_> the tests or your application?
2011-03-02T09:22:57  <andytinkham> app is web based, so all the app communication is handled on the server side. I'm looking to have the tests talk to the db to find suitable data or verify results
2011-03-02T09:23:37  <ian_mac_> so your test code still runs in the same place, generally
2011-03-02T09:23:48  <ian_mac_> it's just a different client browser
2011-03-02T09:24:00  <andytinkham> Yep, that's what I was hoping would be the answer :) Thank you!
