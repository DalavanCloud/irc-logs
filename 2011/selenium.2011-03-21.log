2011-03-21T03:16:24  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: where's a good mozilla channel to go and ask questions about the problems we're having with Core?
2011-03-21T03:16:40  <simonstewart> Also, I think I found a bug in XPCNativeWrapper.unwrap
2011-03-21T03:16:45  <AutomatedTester> jsapi
2011-03-21T03:16:49  <AutomatedTester> but...
2011-03-21T03:16:57  <simonstewart> You're all manic with the release
2011-03-21T03:16:58  <AutomatedTester> I think 90% of them are west coast

2011-03-21T03:17:31  * AutomatedTester really annoyed
2011-03-21T03:17:43  <AutomatedTester> the new firefox driver works brilliantly
2011-03-21T03:17:48  <simonstewart> Thanks
2011-03-21T03:17:55  <simonstewart> Shame the same can't be said about Core
2011-03-21T03:17:55  <AutomatedTester> on everything bar god damn windows

2011-03-21T03:19:02  <simonstewart> Oh. ok
2011-03-21T03:19:03  <AutomatedTester> python
2011-03-21T03:19:06  * simonstewart relaxes
2011-03-21T03:19:14  <AutomatedTester> i rewrote the firefoxdriver for python
2011-03-21T03:19:20  <simonstewart> Nice
2011-03-21T03:19:25  <AutomatedTester> so now it uses less code and works as it should
2011-03-21T03:19:32  <AutomatedTester> lot less fluff
2011-03-21T03:20:12  <simonstewart> Coding music is needed, I think
2011-03-21T03:20:21  <simonstewart> :yt puffy ami yumi call me what you like

2011-03-21T03:34:43  <AutomatedTester> now that I am on Linux/Mac all the time I see why people hate windows...
2011-03-21T03:35:35  <simonstewart> heh
2011-03-21T03:36:02  <AutomatedTester> my code is building a profile nicely by the looks
2011-03-21T03:36:12  <AutomatedTester> but no webdriver extension is started
2011-03-21T03:36:30  <simonstewart> is python okay with the path separator?
2011-03-21T03:36:55  <AutomatedTester> i clean it up

2011-03-21T03:38:05  <AutomatedTester> the extension is installed, its in addons
2011-03-21T03:38:15  <AutomatedTester> but its not in the bottom corner
2011-03-21T03:38:22  <AutomatedTester> and I cant connect to the http server
2011-03-21T03:38:24  <simonstewart> Firefox 4?

2011-03-21T03:38:30  <simonstewart> Take a look at the error console

2011-03-21T03:38:42  <AutomatedTester> good thinking batman
2011-03-21T03:38:48  <simonstewart> normally that indicates that something has gone horribly wrong in the init code
2011-03-21T03:39:02  <simonstewart> Also check the user.js to make sure that all the prefs are as they should be

2011-03-21T03:42:14  <AutomatedTester> the profile is in use since about:config has the same as user.js

2011-03-21T03:42:27  <simonstewart> Error console?
2011-03-21T03:42:27  <AutomatedTester> no errors in the console
2011-03-21T03:42:49  <AutomatedTester> error console says the extension installed cleanly
2011-03-21T03:43:32  <simonstewart> Hmmm....
2011-03-21T03:43:36  <AutomatedTester> going to try something
2011-03-21T03:43:53  <simonstewart> Laughing at the video
2011-03-21T03:51:44  <simonstewart> So, it looks like we're executing a chunk of code with elevated privileges, but not, somehow, calling unwrap successfully, and therefore not being able to override some properties.
2011-03-21T03:56:26  <AutomatedTester> sigh...
2011-03-21T03:56:41  <simonstewart> ?
2011-03-21T03:56:50  <AutomatedTester> so everything is fine
2011-03-21T03:56:56  <AutomatedTester> if I restart firefox
2011-03-21T03:57:07  <simonstewart> Are you doing a "firefox -silent" first?
2011-03-21T03:57:18  <simonstewart> Launching firefox is a two step process
2011-03-21T03:59:09  <AutomatedTester> i wasnt doing that
2011-03-21T03:59:14  <simonstewart> OK.
2011-03-21T03:59:19  <AutomatedTester> but why was it working in Mac?
2011-03-21T03:59:24  <simonstewart> "Luck"?
2011-03-21T03:59:38  <simonstewart> When we lay out the profile it's in pieces
2011-03-21T03:59:55  <simonstewart> So we run firefox with the "-silent" flag to tell it to clean up the profile
2011-03-21T04:00:12  <simonstewart> Use the EM_NO_RESTART env property to prevent it from detaching from the console
2011-03-21T04:00:15  <simonstewart> (which is important)
2011-03-21T04:00:20  <simonstewart> (it turns out)
2011-03-21T04:00:30  <AutomatedTester> i have the EM_NO_RESTART
2011-03-21T04:00:31  <simonstewart> Once that firefox process dies and you've drained the streams
2011-03-21T04:00:42  <simonstewart> start firefox again, but without the "-silent" flag
2011-03-21T04:01:15  <AutomatedTester> oh...
2011-03-21T04:01:30  <AutomatedTester> so build profile, start, kill it, start again?
2011-03-21T04:01:48  <simonstewart> yeah

2011-03-21T05:03:44  <simonstewart> I notice with a certain amount of horror that the latest RC of Firefox 4 is now causing the SRC tests (which were passing) to fail
2011-03-21T05:04:09  <simonstewart> Will be backing through revisions to see if I can find one that works. Maybe I broke something somehow?

2011-03-21T05:07:36  <ato> Sounds fun.
2011-03-21T05:08:00  <simonstewart> In a way, it is
2011-03-21T05:08:08  <simonstewart> I've got a lot of code open right now
2011-03-21T05:08:27  <simonstewart> And it's always interesting to go poking around looking for enlightenment

2011-03-21T05:21:41  <simonstewart> How so?
2011-03-21T05:22:02  <AutomatedTester> 3 builds of Selenium going, one for each OS
2011-03-21T05:22:08  <AutomatedTester> 2 are on VMs
2011-03-21T05:22:14  <simonstewart> Right. Let's see what the heck is going on with XPCNativeWrappers
2011-03-21T05:24:12  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: got an SSD?
2011-03-21T05:24:16  <simonstewart> That helps
2011-03-21T05:24:22  <simonstewart> Our build is mostly single-threaded
2011-03-21T05:24:33  <simonstewart> so you can get a nice speed boost out of an ssd and multiple cores
2011-03-21T05:24:45  <AutomatedTester> no SSD :(
2011-03-21T05:24:59  <AutomatedTester> maybe for my next one I will demand* one
2011-03-21T05:25:05  <AutomatedTester> * ask very nicely
2011-03-21T05:25:11  <simonstewart> It's a transformative experience
2011-03-21T05:25:30  <simonstewart> Have you tried making the cost argument?
2011-03-21T05:25:37  <simonstewart> a 256MB SSD costs X
2011-03-21T05:25:43  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: i havent asked yet
2011-03-21T05:25:49  <simonstewart> How many hours of your time does X equal?
2011-03-21T05:27:13  <simonstewart> OK. So a 256GB SSD is ~$500
2011-03-21T05:27:17  <AutomatedTester> looking at the cost it might not be an issue
2011-03-21T05:27:27  <simonstewart> Or about 307 quid
2011-03-21T05:27:35  * AutomatedTester wanted 8GB ram and was told to take it to Apple to get it done
2011-03-21T05:27:43  <AutomatedTester> at £500 for the upgrade
2011-03-21T05:27:44  <simonstewart> Average UK salary in IT in 40K
2011-03-21T05:27:51  <simonstewart> Ooof
2011-03-21T05:28:14  <simonstewart> Let's assume you have 4 weeks holiday (roughly national UK average)
2011-03-21T05:28:22  <simonstewart> and are paid the average IT salary
2011-03-21T05:28:36  <simonstewart> And an 8 hour working day
2011-03-21T05:28:53  <simonstewart> That (52-4) * 5 * 8
2011-03-21T05:29:13  <simonstewart> 1920 hours a year
2011-03-21T05:29:32  <simonstewart> Or about 21 GBP/hour
2011-03-21T05:29:57  <simonstewart> So a disk equates to about 15 hours of waiting time
2011-03-21T05:30:11  <simonstewart> Spread over the lifetime of the device
2011-03-21T05:30:16  <simonstewart> (3 years, typically)
2011-03-21T05:30:43  <simonstewart> So, ignoring inflation, if the disk saves you 5 hours over the course of a year, it'll pay for itself

2011-03-21T05:31:05  <simonstewart> That seems pretty doable, especially if you're building mozilla from source
2011-03-21T05:31:15  <simonstewart> Because compilation is an exercise in random seeks and reads

2011-03-21T05:38:19  <sasa> hi all
2011-03-21T05:38:40  <simonstewart> hi sasa
2011-03-21T05:38:44  <sasa> i am running into issues with selenium, xvfb and firefox
2011-03-21T05:38:57  <simonstewart> which versions of selenium and firefox?
2011-03-21T05:39:02  <simonstewart> And presumably on linux
2011-03-21T05:39:09  <sasa> i always receive: Failed to start new browser session, shutdown browser and clear all session data
2011-03-21T05:39:24  <sasa> but only since today, on wednesday, when i last tryed it, everything worked fine
2011-03-21T05:39:28  <simonstewart> Typically that means that the DISPLAY value of the selenium-server hasn't been set
2011-03-21T05:39:46  <sasa> ubuntu 10.10
2011-03-21T05:39:48  <simonstewart> Also, try launching firefox manually on your test server
2011-03-21T05:39:50  <sasa> firefox 3.6.15
2011-03-21T05:39:56  <simonstewart> It's possible it's in the middle of an update
2011-03-21T05:40:06  <sasa> selenium 2.0b2
2011-03-21T05:40:31  <simonstewart> And is xvfb still running?
2011-03-21T05:40:35  <simonstewart> I've seen it crash before
2011-03-21T05:40:54  <sasa> i am starting xvfb with:
2011-03-21T05:41:13  <sasa> startx -- `which Xvfb` :1 -screen 0 1024x768x24 2>&1 >/dev/null &
2011-03-21T05:41:20  <sasa> then: DISPLAY=:1 java -jar selenium-server.jar
2011-03-21T05:41:37  <simonstewart> You also need to turn off the security checks
2011-03-21T05:41:56  <simonstewart> -ac or something like that
2011-03-21T05:42:00  <sasa> but when i start java -jar selenium-server.jar (without DISPLAY=:1 at the beginning), firefox will not be pushed in the background and everything works
2011-03-21T05:42:36  <simonstewart> google xvfb disable access restrictions
2011-03-21T05:42:37  <selbot`> http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=7420063
2011-03-21T05:43:00  <simonstewart> Yeah, the "-ac" flag is needed
2011-03-21T05:43:06  <sasa> where?
2011-03-21T05:43:12  <simonstewart> When starting xvfb

2011-03-21T06:31:17  <simonstewart> Hmm... there is one change
2011-03-21T06:31:27  <simonstewart> which is to ensure that we use window modals, and not tab modals
2011-03-21T06:33:20  <jarib> ok?

2011-03-21T06:45:24  <AutomatedTester> jarib: the python bindings were a little fubar
2011-03-21T06:45:35  <AutomatedTester> and it especially showed with Firefox 4
2011-03-21T06:46:09  <AutomatedTester> it would launch but you would get a really nasty alert going "Cant load profiles and alerts"
2011-03-21T06:48:05  <simonstewart> Ohhh... interesting.

2011-03-21T07:20:08  <simonstewart> I also spent some time on that on sunday
2011-03-21T07:20:30  <simonstewart> the standalone version is getting close to useful
2011-03-21T07:22:07  <AutomatedTester> so the reason we cant get alerts working is because of the wrappers?
2011-03-21T07:22:16  <simonstewart> Something like that.

2011-03-21T07:28:03  <davehunt> Do the python bindings have webdriverbackedselenium?
2011-03-21T07:28:15  <AutomatedTester> um kinda
2011-03-21T07:28:19  <simonstewart> lol
2011-03-21T07:28:24  <simonstewart> kinda is the right answer
2011-03-21T07:28:32  <simonstewart> It's got the hooks we need to start adding pieces
2011-03-21T07:28:49  <davehunt> Well until advanced user interactions lands, how can I do a mousedown?
2011-03-21T07:28:54  <davehunt> Using the python bindings
2011-03-21T07:29:00  <simonstewart> "click"
2011-03-21T07:29:18  <AutomatedTester> click should do all the relevent events
2011-03-21T07:29:19  <davehunt> I need mousedown
2011-03-21T07:29:32  <davehunt> Click does a mouseup :P
2011-03-21T07:29:47  <simonstewart> Why do you need a mousedown?
2011-03-21T07:29:54  <davehunt> Playing a canvas game
2011-03-21T07:30:03  <davehunt> Hold the mouse down to engage thrusters
2011-03-21T07:30:08  <simonstewart> Ahhh
2011-03-21T07:30:19  <simonstewart> Then you want to use the advanced user interactions stuff
2011-03-21T07:30:35  <davehunt> Hence the 'until'
2011-03-21T07:30:35  <AutomatedTester> davehunt: /me will try have it ready asap
2011-03-21T07:30:42  <davehunt> I'm using 2.0b1 to drop through to webdriverbackedselenium in Java

2011-03-21T07:33:08  <AutomatedTester> yea
2011-03-21T07:33:18  <AutomatedTester> i dont understand that
2011-03-21T07:33:22  <simonstewart> OK. So I'm not going mad
2011-03-21T07:33:27  <AutomatedTester> race condition?
2011-03-21T07:33:35  <AutomatedTester> since I had to manually click that new alert
2011-03-21T07:33:41  <simonstewart> I tried using a "setTimeout" with no effect
2011-03-21T07:34:04  <simonstewart> I can bump the time out up a bit
2011-03-21T07:37:15  <simonstewart> Bumping the timeout doesn't help
2011-03-21T07:37:49  <simonstewart> Setting it to an absurd value, just in case
2011-03-21T07:37:57  <jarib> ~
2011-03-21T07:37:59  <jarib> ~

2011-03-21T07:38:31  <simonstewart> ~
2011-03-21T07:38:51  <simonstewart> Right, so window.setTimeout ain't the way away from this.

2011-03-21T07:40:10  <jarib> yeah
2011-03-21T07:40:15  <simonstewart> Sounds easy enough
2011-03-21T07:40:29  <jarib> if your ssh connection is hanging for some reason, that will kill it

2011-03-21T07:48:25  <simonstewart> How much context do you have?
2011-03-21T07:48:41  <joewalker> selenium is a testing tool isn't it?
2011-03-21T07:48:43  <joewalker> :)

2011-03-21T07:49:11  <simonstewart> So, we're attempting to get selenium 2.0b3 out the door before Firefox 4.0 ships
2011-03-21T07:49:16  <simonstewart> We're _almost_ there
2011-03-21T07:49:24  <joewalker> so is ff4
2011-03-21T07:49:26  <joewalker> :)
2011-03-21T07:49:30  <simonstewart> But Selenium Core (the JS app) is causing us a huge amount of pain
2011-03-21T07:49:32  <simonstewart> :)
2011-03-21T07:49:40  <simonstewart> (good work on that :)
2011-03-21T07:50:03  <simonstewart> Right now, the blocker is that Selenium Core won't override window.alert
2011-03-21T07:50:19  <simonstewart> I thought it had something to do with XPCNativeWrappers
2011-03-21T07:50:24  <simonstewart> since we're in a chrome context
2011-03-21T07:50:32  <AutomatedTester> or Xray wrappers
2011-03-21T07:50:35  <simonstewart> Right
2011-03-21T07:50:41  <simonstewart> Or Xray wrapper
2011-03-21T07:50:55  <simonstewart> (BTW, is there a way to tell whether an object is an XRayWrapper?)
2011-03-21T07:51:17  <joewalker> from what context?
2011-03-21T07:51:26  <simonstewart> An extension
2011-03-21T07:51:32  <simonstewart> accessed via a chrome:// URL
2011-03-21T07:51:37  *** davehunt has quit IRC
2011-03-21T07:51:56  <simonstewart> As a debugging aid, I added an alert just before we create the selenium instance

2011-03-21T07:52:08  <simonstewart> without it, everything falls over
2011-03-21T07:52:27  <simonstewart> Any ideas why an alert (of all things) will fix things?
2011-03-21T07:52:48  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester reckons it's a race.
2011-03-21T07:53:20  <AutomatedTester> ^ only because there is a natural break for things to catch up while you click the alert
2011-03-21T07:53:21  <simonstewart> Which doesn't sound unreasonable, but I'm having a hard time spotting "setTimeouts" that might cause this.
2011-03-21T07:53:35  <joewalker> sounds like an obvious suggestion, the good/bad news is that i have a team meeting starting right now.
2011-03-21T07:53:44  <simonstewart> Happy team meeting!
2011-03-21T07:53:54  <joewalker> the good part is that I might be able to plug in people less deficient than myself

2011-03-21T08:14:34  <simonstewart> Hi dcamp
2011-03-21T08:14:46  <dcamp> 'morning
2011-03-21T08:14:47  <joewalker> Sumary so far:
2011-03-21T08:15:04  <joewalker> (just posted directly to dcamp)
2011-03-21T08:15:27  <joewalker> it's what simonstewart said here a few mins ago
2011-03-21T08:15:31  <simonstewart> k
2011-03-21T08:15:39  <simonstewart> The "fix" we've implemented is in r11731
2011-03-21T08:15:42  <selbot2> simon.m.stewart 20 minutes ago - SimonStewart: Hacking around a problem in Firefox 4 that is preventing Core tests from runningg. This does not seem like an ideal fix - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11731
2011-03-21T08:15:48  <joewalker> from "So, we're attempting to get selenium 2.0b3 out the door before Firefox 4.0 ships" to "AutomatedTester reckons it's a race"
2011-03-21T08:16:47  <AutomatedTester> dcamp: so simonstewart added a setTimeout and changed the scope chain within a method
2011-03-21T08:16:52  <AutomatedTester> and that has got it working
2011-03-21T08:17:01  <AutomatedTester> make the setTImeout shorter it fails again
2011-03-21T08:17:05  <simonstewart> Though it doesn't feel like a solid fix
2011-03-21T08:17:08  <simonstewart> And that's why
2011-03-21T08:17:36  <AutomatedTester> see r11731 for code reference of hack that makes it work

2011-03-21T08:17:57  <joewalker> presumably ff3.6 doesn't need that hack?
2011-03-21T08:18:01  <simonstewart> Nope
2011-03-21T08:18:04  <AutomatedTester> joewalker: nope
2011-03-21T08:18:11  <simonstewart> No prior versions of Firefox (or IE, for that matter) need it
2011-03-21T08:18:14  <simonstewart> IE 9 runs properly too
2011-03-21T08:18:39  <AutomatedTester> I _guessed_ it might be something to do with threading of the JS compartments
2011-03-21T08:18:46  <AutomatedTester> but could be talking utter rubbish
2011-03-21T08:18:46  <dcamp> how does it fail exactly?
2011-03-21T08:19:02  <simonstewart> The failure manifests as an inability to override "window.alert"
2011-03-21T08:19:13  <simonstewart> even after calling "XPCNativeWrapper.unwrap()"
2011-03-21T08:19:21  <dcamp> inability meaning it throws an exception, or it doesn't take?
2011-03-21T08:19:26  <simonstewart> It doesn't take
2011-03-21T08:19:48  <simonstewart> With the timeout approach, it _does_ take
2011-03-21T08:20:36  <joewalker> what is the value of window.alert just before you override in both the take and don't take cases
2011-03-21T08:20:41  <joewalker> are they the same?
2011-03-21T08:20:48  <simonstewart> yes
2011-03-21T08:20:53  <joewalker> i.e does the overload get overloaded
2011-03-21T08:20:53  <simonstewart> Hang on
2011-03-21T08:21:00  <simonstewart> In the case where it fails they are the same
2011-03-21T08:21:06  <simonstewart> Where it succeeds, they differ
2011-03-21T08:21:16  <simonstewart> The value just before is native code
2011-03-21T08:21:29  <simonstewart> always
2011-03-21T08:21:39  * simonstewart reads that back
2011-03-21T08:21:42  <simonstewart> wow
2011-03-21T08:21:44  <simonstewart> that was confusing
2011-03-21T08:21:47  <joewalker> i'm thinking maybe something does a lazy overload
2011-03-21T08:21:58  <simonstewart> yes: in both cases, immediately before the value of window.alert is identical
2011-03-21T08:22:03  <joewalker> (in FF)
2011-03-21T08:22:09  <joewalker> ok
2011-03-21T08:22:34  <dcamp> so you're saying when it fails it's immediate failure
2011-03-21T08:22:39  <simonstewart> yes
2011-03-21T08:22:44  <simonstewart> Very easy to spot
2011-03-21T08:22:47  *** brettporter has quit IRC
2011-03-21T08:22:54  <dcamp> like oldalert = window.alert; window.alert = newalert; window.alert == oldalert
2011-03-21T08:23:01  <simonstewart> exactly
2011-03-21T08:23:04  <dcamp> ok

2011-03-21T08:26:05  *** jimevans has joined #selenium
2011-03-21T08:26:11  <simonstewart> msucan: hi
2011-03-21T08:26:13  <msucan> simonstewart: when's that code executed? in what context?
2011-03-21T08:26:33  <simonstewart> We're in an extension, accessed via a chrome:// URL
2011-03-21T08:26:39  <msucan> ok
2011-03-21T08:26:51  <msucan> simonstewart: during what event is that code executed?
2011-03-21T08:26:54  <simonstewart> jimevans: listened to the podcast. Good job! Nice plug for help at the end
2011-03-21T08:27:06  <simonstewart> Ultimately it ties back to an onload handler
2011-03-21T08:27:50  <msucan> somehow i'd expect this error only if the event you're listening for ... is earlier than an onload
2011-03-21T08:28:07  <simonstewart> The load process for a selenium test looks a little like:
2011-03-21T08:28:18  <simonstewart> load the test runner (as a chrome url)
2011-03-21T08:28:29  <simonstewart> when the onload event fires, prepare the UI
2011-03-21T08:28:43  <simonstewart> As part of the prep-work for the UI, ensure that there's a global Selenium object
2011-03-21T08:28:53  <jimevans> simonstewart: thanks, mate. i hope everything came across ok. i'd have thought they'd do a slightly better job editing, but still, i thought it was ok.
2011-03-21T08:29:13  *** eranm has joined #selenium
2011-03-21T08:29:20  <simonstewart> If the global selenium object is missing, then create it
2011-03-21T08:29:44  <simonstewart> As part of the creation process, we override the AUT's window's alert, confirm and prompt methods
2011-03-21T08:30:45  <msucan> thanks for the explanation
2011-03-21T08:30:58  <simonstewart> It's fairly dense code to work through
2011-03-21T08:31:02  <simonstewart> :)
2011-03-21T08:31:10  <simonstewart> jimevans: it all came across really well
2011-03-21T08:31:12  <msucan> simonstewart: so you're trying to override the window.alert/confirm/prompt methods of the Chrome Window object. correct?
2011-03-21T08:31:23  <simonstewart> Of the contentWindow
2011-03-21T08:31:30  <simonstewart> Which we unwrap if necessary
2011-03-21T08:31:46  <msucan> contentWindow of ...?
2011-03-21T08:31:52  <msucan> of the current tab?
2011-03-21T08:31:58  <simonstewart> Of the current tab of the AUT
2011-03-21T08:31:59  <dcamp> and did I hear that if you call alert() before setting it, it'll work too?
2011-03-21T08:32:12  <AutomatedTester> dcamp: yea
2011-03-21T08:32:21  <msucan> dcamp: that's most-likely because of the delay
2011-03-21T08:32:22  <simonstewart> Yes. If we call alert in the selenium runner before creating the global selenium object we're good too
2011-03-21T08:32:29  <simonstewart> agreed

2011-03-21T08:34:36  <jarib> :)
2011-03-21T08:34:47  <msucan> simonstewart: did you test with a simpler page? like just window.onload = function() { window.alert = "foo"; };
2011-03-21T08:35:05  <msucan> (or a very simple chrome url that opens)
2011-03-21T08:35:14  <simonstewart> The page under test is pretty plain
2011-03-21T08:35:20  <simonstewart> Just a basic form
2011-03-21T08:35:53  <msucan> how do you load that page?
2011-03-21T08:36:06  <simonstewart> I think we set the test window's location
2011-03-21T08:36:15  <simonstewart> Let me have a rummage through the code
2011-03-21T08:36:18  <msucan> (i am completely new to the selenium codebase, hence asking so many questions)
2011-03-21T08:36:31  <simonstewart> (I've inherited this particular piece)
2011-03-21T08:36:35  <AutomatedTester> msucan: ask away :D
2011-03-21T08:37:10  <simonstewart> Here's the page under test: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/server/test/org/openqa/selenium/tests/TestJavaScriptAttributes.html
2011-03-21T08:37:57  <msucan> simonstewart: you have two window objects. one is of the selenium test runner ... which has the script that executes in chrome context, and you have the test page that executes in content context. from the selenium test runner you are trying to overwrite the contentWindow.alert(). is this a good summary?
2011-03-21T08:38:10  <msucan> (repeating stuff to see if i got it right until now)
2011-03-21T08:38:43  <simonstewart> yes: the selenium runner is in the chrome context, and the AUT is not. We are trying to overwrite contentWindow.alert of the AUT
2011-03-21T08:38:57  <msucan> right
2011-03-21T08:39:18  <msucan> furthermore ... your selenium runner starts to execute on chromeWindow.onload or contentWindow.onload?
2011-03-21T08:39:57  <simonstewart> chromeWindow.onload
2011-03-21T08:40:05  *** sburjan has quit IRC
2011-03-21T08:40:17  <msucan> which one loads first? contentWindow or chromeWindow? what's the approach?
2011-03-21T08:40:22  <simonstewart> chromeWindow
2011-03-21T08:40:38  <msucan> please elaborate
2011-03-21T08:40:47  <simonstewart> Sorry. Was hunting for links for you
2011-03-21T08:41:01  <msucan> (trying to untangle the things :) )
2011-03-21T08:41:17  <simonstewart> The chromeWindow loads the selenium runner in it's "onload" event
2011-03-21T08:41:27  <simonstewart> As part of the set up process, a new child window is opened
2011-03-21T08:41:35  <simonstewart> For running the App Under Test (AUT)
2011-03-21T08:42:04  <simonstewart> Once the "open" returns, the selenium runner overrides the alert function
2011-03-21T08:42:09  <msucan> (ok, continue)
2011-03-21T08:42:28  <simonstewart> This is the place where we see the error
2011-03-21T08:42:37  <msucan> ah
2011-03-21T08:42:45  <simonstewart> We attempt to override the value everytime we see the AUT load a new page
2011-03-21T08:42:48  <simonstewart> (which we poll for)
2011-03-21T08:42:57  <simonstewart> The test itself is loaded via: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/selenium-core/scripts/selenium-testrunner.js#228
2011-03-21T08:43:13  <msucan> simonstewart: in your chromeWindow script do you attach to the contentWindow.onload event?
2011-03-21T08:43:25  <simonstewart> Checking
2011-03-21T08:43:31  <msucan> (to do the override)
2011-03-21T08:43:44  <simonstewart> I don't think we do
2011-03-21T08:44:03  <simonstewart> Certainly we initially begin by passing a reference straight in
2011-03-21T08:44:15  <simonstewart> to the selenium object's constructor
2011-03-21T08:44:19  <msucan> simonstewart: how do you poll for "new page loads"?
2011-03-21T08:44:28  <msucan> in the contentWindow
2011-03-21T08:44:40  <simonstewart> This is going to take a little spelunking
2011-03-21T08:45:08  <simonstewart> (since I inherited this code: it's been a while since I had to tie all the pieces together in a coherent explanation :)
2011-03-21T08:45:22  <msucan> :)
2011-03-21T08:46:41  <simonstewart> This is where we set things up:
2011-03-21T08:46:43  <simonstewart> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/selenium-core/scripts/selenium-browserbot.js#764
2011-03-21T08:47:23  <simonstewart> pollForLoad is declared at:
2011-03-21T08:47:34  <simonstewart> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/selenium-core/scripts/selenium-browserbot.js#875
2011-03-21T08:47:41  <simonstewart> and does a check of the readyState of the page
2011-03-21T08:48:16  <simonstewart> The check being done from the runner in the chrome context

2011-03-21T08:51:28  <msucan> simonstewart: sounds like that's the case, then. too early
2011-03-21T08:51:53  <simonstewart> Which is puzzling, because we don't see this in any other browser (or earlier versions of Firefox)
2011-03-21T08:52:19  <msucan> to me it sounds like something i bumped into once, but i never really bothered. i know that once i also failed to overwrite some native methods, i can't recall in what situation it was
2011-03-21T08:52:31  <msucan> but i know i summed it up to "ah, too early"
2011-03-21T08:52:36  <simonstewart> lol

2011-03-21T08:52:40  <msucan> :)
2011-03-21T08:53:05  <dcamp> I wonder if you somehow don't have an inner window yet
2011-03-21T08:53:05  <simonstewart> I guess a more robust fix is to attempt to override a function and only continue if it succeeds
2011-03-21T08:53:23  <msucan> dcamp: exactly
2011-03-21T08:53:37  <simonstewart> If that's the case, how come we can get a reference to it?
2011-03-21T08:53:42  <msucan> simonstewart: what i suggest is you continue to poll until it works
2011-03-21T08:53:44  <simonstewart> I'd expect the reference to be null
2011-03-21T08:53:54  <simonstewart> msucan: that's what I was thinking
2011-03-21T08:53:55  <msucan> (add a fail safe ... after N tries ... report the error)
2011-03-21T08:53:56  <dcamp> you can't ever really get a reference to an inner window
2011-03-21T08:54:06  <simonstewart> interesting
2011-03-21T08:54:10  <simonstewart> Thank you, btw.
2011-03-21T08:54:11  <dcamp> when you reference a 'window' object in JS, it's referring to the "outer window"
2011-03-21T08:54:17  <dcamp> imagine this:
2011-03-21T08:54:18  <simonstewart> I know you guys must be frantically busy
2011-03-21T08:54:21  <dcamp> window.foo = 'bar'
2011-03-21T08:54:27  <dcamp> window.location = "http://new/location"
2011-03-21T08:54:36  <dcamp> ... wait for navigation ...
2011-03-21T08:54:38  <msucan> dcamp: yep, you get the outer window. and perhaps window.alert = "foo" executes *before* the inner window is constructed
2011-03-21T08:54:40  <dcamp> what is window.foo now?
2011-03-21T08:54:52  <simonstewart> undefined.
2011-03-21T08:55:00  <jarib> jimevans: woo, i'm mentioned in the podcast! :)
2011-03-21T08:55:02  <simonstewart> Ohhh.... good question
2011-03-21T08:55:11  <dcamp> simonstewart: the reason it's undefined is because foo is a property of the inner window.
2011-03-21T08:55:15  <jimevans> jarib: hey, credit where it's due, my man. :)
2011-03-21T08:55:31  * jimevans hopes he pronounced jarib's name correctly.
2011-03-21T08:55:37  <dcamp> simonstewart: during navigation, we kinda swap out the implementatation (inner window) of the window object
2011-03-21T08:55:37  <simonstewart> And we never see the inner window because it's an implementation detail of how "window" is implemented?
2011-03-21T08:55:43  <dcamp> right.
2011-03-21T08:55:49  <simonstewart> ok. That makes sense
2011-03-21T08:56:09  <jarib> jimevans: almost :) great job btw
2011-03-21T08:56:16  * simonstewart ruminates on new knowledge
2011-03-21T08:56:21  <dcamp> you'd need someone that knows more than I do to explain why its behavior changed in 4.0 :P
2011-03-21T08:56:26  <simonstewart> lol
2011-03-21T08:56:36  <dcamp> I do know that ther inner/outer window implementation was tweaked quite a bit in 4.0
2011-03-21T08:56:41  <msucan> simonstewart: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Inner_and_outer_windows
2011-03-21T08:56:44  <simonstewart> well, at least we've identified the problem and know a way to avoid it
2011-03-21T08:56:58  <msucan> the swapping of inner windows is what kills that window.alert change
2011-03-21T08:57:01  <dcamp> well, I'm not 100% confident that's the problem, but it seems to fix
2011-03-21T08:57:04  <dcamp> err, seems to fit
2011-03-21T08:57:08  <simonstewart> Agreed
2011-03-21T08:57:21  <simonstewart> And that's all we need to get 2.0b3 out the door :)
2011-03-21T08:57:29  <msucan> great :)
2011-03-21T08:57:33  <msucan> good luck!

2011-03-21T08:59:08  <simonstewart> Like tidying up Grid 2 so that it's easy to start
2011-03-21T08:59:37  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: are the python bindings ready to go?
2011-03-21T08:59:41  <simonstewart> jimevans: .net ones?
2011-03-21T08:59:45  <simonstewart> jarib: ruby?
2011-03-21T08:59:53  <jimevans> simonstewart: .net is good to go.
2011-03-21T08:59:53  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: roger
2011-03-21T08:59:54  <jarib> yes
2011-03-21T09:00:03  <simonstewart> Sweet. So it's just me holding things up then :)
2011-03-21T09:00:27  <AutomatedTester> i wanted the FirefoxDriver rewrite and am happy now
2011-03-21T09:00:35  <simonstewart> Excellent.
2011-03-21T09:00:50  <AutomatedTester> next version do the ChromeDriver rewrite
2011-03-21T09:01:13  <simonstewart> Once eranm checks in, I'll be running all "./go test_javascript test_java" on Mac, Linux and Win7
2011-03-21T09:01:28  <simonstewart> Skipping the IE tests because my Win7 machine cries when I use it
2011-03-21T09:02:24  <jimevans> i've got the ie tests covered.
2011-03-21T09:02:25  <simonstewart> Sound reasonable?
2011-03-21T09:02:30  <simonstewart> Thanks Jim
2011-03-21T09:02:44  <jimevans> np
2011-03-21T09:03:32  <jimevans> having run them recently on all platforms, i'll run them against ie9 only, if you think that's reasonable.
2011-03-21T09:04:47  <eranm> Simon, are the native events tests failing with test_firefox or test_remote?

2011-03-21T10:44:58  <simonstewart> especially since alerts and prompts ain't implemented completely in Firefox or IE

2011-03-21T11:31:53  <jimevans> .NET deprecates IRenderedWebElement.Hover() method and IOptions.Speed property.
2011-03-21T11:32:43  <jimevans> but these haven't been removed yet, just marked "Obsolete".

2011-03-21T13:08:59  <new2b> I copied a function into the beginning of the file - how can i call it to store a formatted currenttime into a variable?

2011-03-21T13:13:36  <jimevans> eranm: I'm not sure exactly what VS2010 buys us, except for .NET4, and we *will* need that someday, probably before too long.
2011-03-21T13:13:37  *** cburroughs has quit IRC
2011-03-21T13:13:54  <jimevans> From the build side, the unmanaged code can be built with MSBuild, which gives us a little finer control.
2011-03-21T13:14:49  <jimevans> And we do get requests from time-to-time on the user mailing lists for it.
2011-03-21T13:15:22  <eranm> I think the .NET 4 is the strongest reason
2011-03-21T13:15:59  <jimevans> I agree. Even if we don't support it today, it's worth laying the foundation for supporting it tomorrow. :)
2011-03-21T13:18:10  <jimevans> Also, the latest version of Sandcastle Help File Builder, which I use to generate the .NET bindings' docs requires .NET 4 now.

2011-03-21T13:32:45  <jimevans> ^^ this is an excerpt of a modification to visualstudio.rb in the crazy-fun mappings.
2011-03-21T13:33:37  <jimevans> it seems like the reference_assemblies_dir() and framework_dir() methods should be attributes?
2011-03-21T13:34:48  <jimevans> however, there's no real need for them to be exposed external to the class; they're strictly internal.
2011-03-21T13:35:28  *** gronky has quit IRC
2011-03-21T13:36:53  <jarib> jimevans: what sort of attributes?
2011-03-21T13:38:22  <jimevans> sorry, perhaps i'm using the wrong terminology. what i really mean is should they be private member variables to the class? should i use an accessor to get their values? what is more "proper"?
2011-03-21T13:39:30  <jarib> seems fine to have them as methods like this
2011-03-21T13:39:49  <jarib> you could cache the value if they're called multiple times
2011-03-21T13:40:17  <jarib> e.g. @reference_assemblies_dir ||= ( ... )
2011-03-21T13:40:43  <jimevans> well, yeah, that's the reason i'm asking. these methods likely *will* get called multiple times. so that's what i'm looking for right there.
2011-03-21T13:40:58  <jarib> is the env vars being set an intended side effect?
2011-03-21T13:41:23  <jarib> e.g. if 'programfiles(x86)' is set you set 'ProgramFiles(x86)' to its value
2011-03-21T13:41:34  <jimevans> er... no. that's my misunderstanding of ruby.

2011-03-21T13:52:14  <jarib> it returns the first element for which the block returns a truish value, or nil if none of the elements do
2011-03-21T13:52:36  <jarib> (truish in ruby being anything besides nil or false)
2011-03-21T13:53:01  <jimevans> truish not to be confused with "truthy". :)
2011-03-21T13:54:52  <jarib> heh
2011-03-21T13:55:13  <jarib> truthy is more common i guess :)
