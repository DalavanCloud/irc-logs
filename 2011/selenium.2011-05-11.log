2011-05-11T04:31:19  <jarib> ato: it's in the advanced interaction api. implemented, not so much
2011-05-11T04:31:27  <jarib> chromedriver trunk supports it
2011-05-11T04:31:45  <ato> Ah, there is actually an API for it?

2011-05-11T04:37:23  <ato> jarib: So I see theres the ContextClickAction.
2011-05-11T04:37:37  <ato> Has any thought gone into how to actually click the elements inside that menu?
2011-05-11T04:37:45  <ato> I mean, right clicking isn't the problem.
2011-05-11T04:38:20  <ato> Opera's internal builds implement the right-click menu as a window with an SVG in it, Desktop implements it in native VGA library, Mobile as a widget, …

2011-05-11T05:06:14  <davehunt> For me it has some issues with backward compatibility, which freynaud is aware of
2011-05-11T05:22:35  <sburjan> hello. which way is the best for checking if a element is visible ? I need to assert this, so there should be a way not to throw an exception

2011-05-11T05:29:03  <barancev> sburjan: I use if (((RenderedWebElement) e).isDisplayed())
2011-05-11T05:29:36  <barancev> but RenderedWebElement is deprecated, so there should be another way
2011-05-11T05:31:40  *** mbeierl has joined #selenium
2011-05-11T05:32:08  <sburjan> found. use findElements.. that doesn't throw an exception. and check if size is 0 then the element is not in the dom
2011-05-11T05:38:48  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-05-11T05:38:52  <barancev> sburjan: it is different - an element found by findElements can be not visible

2011-05-11T06:09:18  * wilhelm_ senses an ugly hack approaching.
2011-05-11T06:09:41  <freynaud> is /scripts/selenium/fireEvent.js a generated file or is it supposed to be in the sources ? I got an error saying the file cannot be located when I try to use the js library from seleniumemulation

2011-05-11T06:25:14  <ato> jarib: Do you know of any way to query HTTP headers, like mime type?
2011-05-11T06:26:33  <jarib> use a proxy
2011-05-11T06:27:26  *** Ivog has joined #selenium
2011-05-11T06:27:30  <wilhelm_> The brower knows, though. Should be possible to extract that information.
2011-05-11T06:28:27  <ato> jarib: Like, you mean tell Sinatra to serve file with specified mime type?
2011-05-11T06:28:52  <jarib> the ability to query HTTP headers won't be added to the webdriver API
2011-05-11T06:28:59  <ato> wilhelm_: That's what I'm thinking too.
2011-05-11T06:29:08  <jarib> we recommend people use a proxy if they want that information
2011-05-11T06:29:31  <ato> I'm not sure what you mean by “proxy” here.
2011-05-11T06:29:38  <jarib> an HTTP proxy
2011-05-11T06:29:42  <jarib> that you point the browser at
2011-05-11T06:29:49  <jarib> that collects information
2011-05-11T06:30:41  <jarib> e.g. https://github.com/lightbody/browsermob-proxy
2011-05-11T06:30:41  <ato> So, set up some Ruby HTTP proxy library, then set browser to use proxy, then query the proxy library?
2011-05-11T06:31:04  <jarib> yeah
2011-05-11T06:31:45  <jarib> except i don't think such a library exist
2011-05-11T06:31:50  <wilhelm_> Hm. I'm not a fan.
2011-05-11T06:31:51  <jarib> the browsermob-proxy attempts to solve that
2011-05-11T06:31:51  <ato> Would it be an idea to add this to WebDriver itself?
2011-05-11T06:32:09  <jarib> it's an idea that has been dismissed :)
2011-05-11T06:32:36  <jarib> search the tracker/mailing list
2011-05-11T06:32:43  <ato> Do you remember why ?
2011-05-11T06:33:29  <ato> The reason I'm asking is that XHTML and WML testing is broken with OperaDriver currently, and we need to figure out what kind of document we're dealing with to know how to retrieve attributes.
2011-05-11T06:34:01  <jarib> who needs to know?
2011-05-11T06:34:25  <ato> Watir presumably, because that only deals in lowercase terms.
2011-05-11T06:34:25  <jarib> certainly the user of the webdriver API shouldn't have to make the distinction

2011-05-11T06:52:36  <sdimkov> jarib: I'm trying to set remote firefox driver to default profile. I found I should do that in the capabilities object I pass. There is a property "firefox_profile". The thing is when I set it to "default" I get an error that it doesn't have "as_json" method.
2011-05-11T06:53:22  <sdimkov> I guess it comes from here "hash['firefox_profile'] = firefox_profile.as_json['zip'] if firefox_profile"  at line 166 in capabilities.rb

2011-05-11T07:57:23  <jimevans> true, but the readme explicitly says to remmove them, so i did.

2011-05-11T09:38:27  <simonstewart> Most odd

2011-05-11T09:47:43  <simonstewart> heh.
2011-05-11T09:47:51  <simonstewart> reads like an email I've just seen....

2011-05-11T09:48:07  <simonstewart> b: ''
2011-05-11T09:48:15  <simonstewart> or, aguably, "foo"
2011-05-11T09:48:19  <jleyba> Wanted to hit a larger audience :)
2011-05-11T09:48:22  <simonstewart> consisitency says ""
2011-05-11T09:48:37  <simonstewart> or that a is: name: foo
2011-05-11T09:48:44  <simonstewart> Which leads us into a whole world of pain
2011-05-11T09:48:46  <jarib> i think "name: " and ""
2011-05-11T09:49:09  <jarib> which is what we do now, right?
2011-05-11T09:49:11  <simonstewart> Right. End of Day here
2011-05-11T09:49:17  <simonstewart> jarib: right

2011-05-11T09:49:21  *** simonstewart has quit IRC
2011-05-11T09:50:03  <jleyba> I think the empty string is surprising
2011-05-11T09:50:14  <jarib> jleyba: what's the rationale for adding the input value?
2011-05-11T09:50:39  <jleyba> I agree we don't want to get into the "name: foo" trap
2011-05-11T09:51:20  <jleyba> but I think it's reasonable to expect getText() to return the value of a text form element, if called directly on that element
2011-05-11T09:51:42  *** skiphuffman__ has quit IRC
2011-05-11T09:53:38  <jarib> i don't like the idea of "name: " and "foo"
2011-05-11T09:54:53  <jarib> i think consistency is more important, especially since we have a single WebElement class
2011-05-11T09:55:26  <jarib> in watir-webdriver input.text() returns the value, but we have an Input class subclassing Element
2011-05-11T09:55:41  *** dlam has joined #selenium
2011-05-11T09:58:08  <jarib> branching in getText() on the element type eventually leads down that rabbit hole :)
2011-05-11T09:58:25  *** sdimkov has quit IRC
2011-05-11T09:58:34  <jarib> perhaps do a support class, i.e. new Input(element).getText() that calls getAttribute("value")

2011-05-11T13:59:58  <jarib> webdriver will use native mouse clicks where possible
2011-05-11T13:59:58  <nilobject> You're right -- I'm not even looking deep enough at my code -- the wrapper object I'm using is faking it with javascript.
2011-05-11T14:00:34  <nilobject> Which is why it was "working" in watir. So it's safe to assume that Watir *doesn't* support it. :)
2011-05-11T14:01:11  <jarib> and btw, the mouse stuff is already implemented in chrome, just not released yet
2011-05-11T14:01:20  <jarib> so just hang tight
2011-05-11T14:01:22  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-05-11T14:01:42  <phdaemon> how do I add different Remote Control servers to a selenium grid?
2011-05-11T14:02:05  <phdaemon> im trying to find a tutorial in google and im not finding anything
2011-05-11T14:06:52  <ivog> phdaemon what version of grid are you allready working with grid 2.0?
2011-05-11T14:08:35  *** True_Blue has quit IRC
2011-05-11T14:09:01  <phdaemon> the latest one, but i think you add them by doing this? "ant -Dport=5556 -Denvironment="*chrome" -Dhost=10.0.1.197 -DhubURL=http://10.0.1.206:4444 launch-remote-control"
2011-05-11T14:09:02  <phdaemon> ?
2011-05-11T14:09:17  <phdaemon> where 10.0.1.197 = my RC server?
2011-05-11T14:09:48  <ivog> yea that's how its done in grid 1.0
2011-05-11T14:09:55  <phdaemon> oh
2011-05-11T14:09:59  <phdaemon> then no, i have grid 2.0
2011-05-11T14:10:01  <phdaemon> the beta one
2011-05-11T14:10:07  <phdaemon> and the latests RCs too
2011-05-11T14:10:16  <ivog> with grid 2.0 you can register an rc like so:
2011-05-11T14:11:39  <ivog> java -jar selenium-standalone.jar -role webdriver -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register -port 5555 -log webdriverlog.txt
2011-05-11T14:12:01  <ivog> so that starts an rc and registers it to the hub
2011-05-11T14:12:13  <phdaemon> Also, i have another question: Do i need an RC for each browser? For example: In windows i have firefox, ie, chrome and safari, do i need to initiate an RC for each one?
2011-05-11T14:12:24  <ivog> no
2011-05-11T14:13:06  <ivog> an rc supports a couple of browsers by default, firefox, ie and chrome
2011-05-11T14:13:47  <ivog> you can see that if you've registered your rc and then look at the grid console by going to http://localhost:4444/grid/console
2011-05-11T14:14:20  <phdaemon> yeah, mine is just localhost:4444/console
2011-05-11T14:14:34  *** csanchez has joined #selenium
2011-05-11T14:14:36  <ivog> how'd did you start the grid?
2011-05-11T14:14:51  <phdaemon> ant launch-hub
2011-05-11T14:14:57  <ivog> thats grid 1.0
2011-05-11T14:15:09  <phdaemon> how do i start the 2.0 then?
2011-05-11T14:15:20  <ivog> if you want to use grid 2.0 you should get the source and build it using go release
2011-05-11T14:15:30  <ivog> did you checkout the source?
2011-05-11T14:15:39  <ivog> (its not that much work)
2011-05-11T14:16:05  <phdaemon> ahhh, no i didnt :/ i thought i had 2.0
2011-05-11T14:16:08  <phdaemon> i actually have selenium-grid-1.0.8-bin.zip
2011-05-11T14:16:19  <ivog> yes thats selenium 1.0
2011-05-11T14:16:21  <phdaemon> yeah
2011-05-11T14:16:27  <ivog> err grid 1.0 i mean
2011-05-11T14:16:39  <phdaemon> the RC version i have is 2.0b3
2011-05-11T14:17:12  <ivog> yea ok, i should have explained... u can't register webdriver to grid 1.0 you'll need grid 2.0
2011-05-11T14:17:30  <phdaemon> ok, and how well does that play with PHPUnit?
2011-05-11T14:17:38  <ivog> so if you want to start using webdriver with grid you'll need to get the source build it and start grid 2.0
2011-05-11T14:17:59  <ivog> if phpunit driver supports the webdriver protocol it should work
2011-05-11T14:18:14  <ivog> if don't know anything about the phpunit driver...
2011-05-11T14:18:22  <phdaemon> phpunit just uses the selenium ide driver, (i point it to a server, port, and tell it a browser)
2011-05-11T14:18:25  <ivog> if=I
2011-05-11T14:18:38  <phdaemon> selenium driver*
2011-05-11T14:19:18  <phdaemon> so with grid, i can point it to grid, and grid forwards the tests to the different RCs
2011-05-11T14:19:20  <phdaemon> correct?
2011-05-11T14:19:25  <ivog> is that a webdriver or driver which starts up the extra selenium window ( selenium core )?
2011-05-11T14:19:37  <ivog> yes
2011-05-11T14:20:30  <sdimkov> I'm getting "unable to connect to host 127.0.0.2 on port 7055" at selenium server. I believe it's picking up the wrong address (should be 127.0.0.1) and it's probably related to #1181
2011-05-11T14:20:31  <selbot2_>  closed/fixed Firefox driver connection problem - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1181
2011-05-11T14:21:05  <phdaemon> ivog, ok, so instead of using 1.0.x i should just dl 2.0?
2011-05-11T14:21:13  <phdaemon> do the RC 2.0b not work with 1.0?
2011-05-11T14:23:26  <ivog> if what your using is a php webdriver you'll need grid 2.0
2011-05-11T14:23:56  <ivog> if what your using is a php selenium 1.0 bindings then you can use grid 1.0
2011-05-11T14:24:05  <phdaemon> ok
2011-05-11T14:24:09  *** AutomatedTester has quit IRC
2011-05-11T14:24:14  <phdaemon> well, i think im using 1.0
2011-05-11T14:24:18  <phdaemon> so
2011-05-11T14:24:26  <phdaemon> i launch selenium grid using ant
2011-05-11T14:24:36  <ivog> ok sorry, i'm not helping you very well :)
2011-05-11T14:24:36  <phdaemon> then i add the rest of them with the command i posted?
2011-05-11T14:25:22  <phdaemon> lol well, at least your helping :)
2011-05-11T14:25:59  <ivog> if i remember correctly you can start the rc using java -jar selenium<version>.jar -hubUrl=<huburl>
2011-05-11T14:26:44  <ivog> sdimkov: are you setting a firefoxprofile on the driver?
2011-05-11T14:27:49  <phdaemon> i dont see that as a parameter
2011-05-11T14:27:56  <phdaemon> unrecognized arg
2011-05-11T14:28:04  <ivog> let me check
2011-05-11T14:28:17  <barancev> when I run go test_firefox, I get testSendingKeysToAFocusedElementShouldNotBlurThatElement failed because of "blur fired: focus blur focus keydown keypress keyup"
2011-05-11T14:28:18  <sdimkov> ivoq: nope
2011-05-11T14:28:40  <barancev> but when I run a single class with SingleTestSuite -- all is OK
2011-05-11T14:29:08  <barancev> what's different?

2011-05-11T14:32:04  <barancev> it looks like browser loses focus for a moment (focus blur focus keydown keypress keyup), but what causes that?
2011-05-11T14:32:24  <ivog> phdaemon: the ant command you posted should work
2011-05-11T14:32:45  <phdaemon> ant -Dport=5556 -Dhost=10.20.70.245 -DhubURL=http://10.20.70.131:4444 launch-remote-control
2011-05-11T14:32:53  <phdaemon> keeps the terminal open
2011-05-11T14:32:53  <ivog> yea
2011-05-11T14:33:04  <phdaemon> and registers it as firefox on the environment for some reason
2011-05-11T14:33:05  <phdaemon> :/
2011-05-11T14:38:19  <ivog> and your not able to start another kind of browser?
2011-05-11T14:38:41  <phdaemon> ok, let me see if i can break it all down
2011-05-11T14:38:58  <phdaemon> I want to be able to run all browsers at the same time (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari)
2011-05-11T14:39:35  <phdaemon> i initiated RC in windows with this: java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar
2011-05-11T14:40:01  <phdaemon> i have selenium grid running in my linux computer
2011-05-11T14:40:19  <phdaemon> in linux i do this: ant -Dport=5556 -Dhost=10.20.70.245 -DhubURL=http://10.20.70.131:4444 launch-remote-control
2011-05-11T14:41:36  <phdaemon> and i see the something in Available Remote Controls come up
2011-05-11T14:42:03  <phdaemon> it says, Host: The address of my windows box. Port : 5556. Environment *firefox
2011-05-11T14:42:07  <phdaemon> no matter how many RCs i start
2011-05-11T14:42:11  <phdaemon> it defaults to firefox.
2011-05-11T14:43:55  <phdaemon> so what am i doing wrong?
2011-05-11T14:45:58  <ivog> and how do you initialize the selenium object in php?
2011-05-11T14:46:53  <phdaemon> http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/selenium.html
2011-05-11T14:47:23  <phdaemon>  public static $browsers = array(

2011-05-11T14:47:47  <phdaemon> and so on
2011-05-11T14:48:09  <phdaemon> technically, it doesnt look like it even needs a grid, if i have just have RCs installed in all of them, but im not sure thats how it works
2011-05-11T14:49:17  <ivog> so what happens when you try to use safari?
2011-05-11T14:53:17  <phdaemon> it doesnt do it at the same time
2011-05-11T14:53:27  <phdaemon> and safari hangs
2011-05-11T14:53:36  <phdaemon> it launches safari but its just hanging there
2011-05-11T14:53:53  <ivog> while it works in firefox?
2011-05-11T14:53:56  <phdaemon> yeah
2011-05-11T14:53:58  <phdaemon> seems that way
2011-05-11T14:53:58  <phdaemon> but
2011-05-11T14:54:02  <phdaemon> it doesnt do it at the same time
2011-05-11T14:54:03  <ivog> what about ie and chrome?
2011-05-11T14:54:04  <phdaemon> which sucks
2011-05-11T14:54:36  <ivog> firefox is the most stable browser so its best to first start out in firefox
2011-05-11T14:54:53  <ivog> if that doesn't work you shouldn't even look at other stuff basically
2011-05-11T14:55:02  <phdaemon> yeah
2011-05-11T14:55:04  <phdaemon> firefox worked
2011-05-11T14:55:19  <ivog> your using ff 3 right?
2011-05-11T14:55:22  <phdaemon> Got result: OK on session ...... blah blah

2011-05-11T14:59:06  <phdaemon> but it still doesnt run them in parallel
2011-05-11T14:59:12  <phdaemon> which is why i want grid :*(
2011-05-11T14:59:27  <ivog> is phpunit a parallel testing framework?
2011-05-11T14:59:48  <ivog> can it start multiple threads simulataniously?
2011-05-11T15:00:26  <seanh-ansca> not that i've seen, you could call it more than once though and background it
2011-05-11T15:01:33  <seanh-ansca> i'm having an issue where when i run a test against a new RC that i've setup (osx 10.6.7, firefox 3.6). when  it first loads the site it thinks it needs to download it
2011-05-11T15:01:42  <seanh-ansca> has any one else seen anything like that?
2011-05-11T15:03:51  <phdaemon> yeah
2011-05-11T15:03:54  <phdaemon> but it doesnt matter

2011-05-11T15:04:12  *** tyler_g has left #selenium

2011-05-11T15:10:18  <phdaemon> yes, but it always registered as firefox

2011-05-11T15:19:39  <seanh-ansca> does the rc show up on the hub console?
2011-05-11T15:23:09  <ivog> phdaemon i think the *firefox you're seeing should be overridable by your tests specifically requesting a ie browser
2011-05-11T15:24:34  <ivog> so what i suspect is if you launched your hub and registered a rc ( which displays with environment *firefox) you'll still be able to ask for a ie browser
2011-05-11T15:24:46  <ivog> i personally never cared much for any other browser then firefox
2011-05-11T15:25:24  <ivog> on the left in grid console you'll see the configured environments, what does it say?
2011-05-11T15:30:40  <ivog> phdaemon: you should try -Denvironment=*iexplore parameter to register an internetexplorer rc

2011-05-11T15:54:21  <phdaemon> not the RC
2011-05-11T15:54:36  <phdaemon> or do they both have to match?
2011-05-11T15:54:41  <nirvdrum> Sure.  But -Dport is the port of the node.
2011-05-11T15:55:05  <nirvdrum> In the command you provided it was 5556.  In heartbeat URL you pasted it's 4446

2011-05-11T15:56:18  <phdaemon> ant -Dport=4446 -Denv=*chrome -Dhost=10.20.70.245 -DhubURL=http://10.20.70.131:4444 launch-remote-control
2011-05-11T15:56:22  <phdaemon> thats what i used to start this one
2011-05-11T15:56:30  <phdaemon> since before it didnt work, im trying different ports
2011-05-11T15:56:39  <phdaemon> i have multiple RCs running
2011-05-11T15:56:42  <phdaemon> one is in port 4446

2011-05-11T16:04:35  <nirvdrum> So, what exactly is the problem you're having?
2011-05-11T16:05:34  <ivog> nirvdrum: maybe you can help me also :)
2011-05-11T16:05:48  <ivog> setting a firefox profile on a remotewebdriver seems to be broken
2011-05-11T16:05:50  <nirvdrum> gotta be quick.  My dinner is almost ready :-)
2011-05-11T16:05:56  <ivog> ok :)
2011-05-11T16:06:12  <nirvdrum> ivog: Ahh. I haven't really used the WebDriver portion yet.  freynaud is the guy you want to talk to.
2011-05-11T16:06:20  <ivog> seems to have been caused by latest change to FirefoxProfile.java
