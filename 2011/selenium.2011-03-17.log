2011-03-17T07:49:10  <mister_m> With NUnit and C# - my testfixture looks like this: [TestFixture("*custom <C:\\Documents and Settings\\youngm\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe>")]. If I simply use *chrome, it runs the tests in firefox. But the path to chrome fails when I do a selenium.start()

2011-03-17T08:01:03  <mister_m> antlong: hm
2011-03-17T08:01:26  <antlong> mister_m, but line 28 does look funny
2011-03-17T08:01:44  <mister_m> antlong: the chrome browser opens on an index of a temporary custom profile it looks like
2011-03-17T08:02:30  <antlong> mister_m, what happens if you change line 28, Browser, Config.serverRoot   to the actual xtion string
2011-03-17T08:02:47  <mister_m> antlong: I'll try it one second
2011-03-17T08:05:13  <mister_m> antlong: the server window shows it waiting after the started socketlistener
2011-03-17T08:05:48  <RossPatterson> antlong: There's nothing funny about that - that's the syntax for an NUnit parameterized test.
2011-03-17T08:06:19  <antlong> RossPatterson, i dont see the part where its passing in line 5
2011-03-17T08:06:55  <antlong> RossPatterson, but like i said i dont know enough about this language :)
2011-03-17T08:06:57  <RossPatterson> It feeds through the TestFixture(string) constructor.
2011-03-17T08:07:10  <RossPatterson> It's C#, but the particular point is NUnit-specific.
2011-03-17T08:07:22  <mister_m> antlong: I was able to get the tests running using *googlechrome, instead of *chrome
2011-03-17T08:07:22  <jimevans> antlong: not to worry, it's legitimate. The TestFixture attribute on the class is inter
2011-03-17T08:07:33  <antlong> mister_m oh
2011-03-17T08:07:38  <antlong> mister_m, *chrome is for firefox
2011-03-17T08:07:43  <mister_m> antlong: yep :)
2011-03-17T08:07:45  <jimevans> oops. finger slip. sorry guys.
2011-03-17T08:08:01  <mister_m> antlong: thanks for your patience.
2011-03-17T08:08:04  <antlong> no problem
2011-03-17T08:08:04  <RossPatterson> mister_m: You just got bit by my favorite Selenium mistake.  "chrome" is Firefox.  "googlechrome" is Chrome.  Blame Google, but also blame Selenium :-)
2011-03-17T08:08:17  <mister_m> RossPatterson: :)
2011-03-17T08:08:18  <RossPatterson> Completely missed that in your description.
2011-03-17T08:08:50  <antlong> heh mister_m , chrome in firefox existed before google made the Chrome browser
2011-03-17T08:09:23  <RossPatterson> Yeah, but it's also such an insider-ism that we shouldn't have allowed it as a synonym for Firefox.
2011-03-17T08:09:36  <AutomatedTester> RossPatterson: blame google, Mozilla called it that long time ago
2011-03-17T08:09:39  <antlong> yeah :( too late now though, eh
2011-03-17T08:09:54  <RossPatterson> Plus, *chrome isn't EXACTLY the same as *firefox in Selenium RC - they use different classes for the launcher!
2011-03-17T08:10:17  <antlong> AutomatedTester, i got a chuckle out of the comment this morning. i get double irked, once when code is there i cant use, once when code isnt there i couldnt use, lol

2011-03-17T08:24:20  <antlong> whatd i miss
2011-03-17T08:25:04  <True_Blue> Hows it going
2011-03-17T08:26:10  <RossPatterson> jimevans: Hmm ... Google Code keeps stats: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list.  Dunno how representative that is.  But RC 1.03 (which I still believe is the predominant server right now) is 169K.  Almost no IDE downloads there though.
2011-03-17T08:26:27  <antlong> RossPatterson, ide downloads go through mozilla, no
2011-03-17T08:26:48  <antlong> i think that counter only updates when google serves the file
2011-03-17T08:27:01  <jimevans> RossPatterson: that "169k" number helps.
2011-03-17T08:27:18  <RossPatterson> antlong: So I thought.  But the XPI is directly available from seleniumhq.org.  And I can't actually find the IDE through the add-ons dialog.  Which is weird.
2011-03-17T08:27:27  <jimevans> Can I confidently say "hundreds of thousands of users worldwide"?
2011-03-17T08:27:32  <RossPatterson> Yes, GoogleCode only counts GoogleCode downloads :-)
2011-03-17T08:27:42  <jimevans> or "more than a hundred thousand?"
2011-03-17T08:27:48  <antlong> jimevans, around 100k?
2011-03-17T08:27:55  <RossPatterson> jimevans: Based on my inbox, I'd say millions in India alone :-)
2011-03-17T08:28:00  <jimevans> :-)
2011-03-17T08:28:08  <antlong> jimevans, some people download way more than once
2011-03-17T08:28:09  <antlong> RossPatterson lol
2011-03-17T08:28:58  *** kpiwko has quit IRC
2011-03-17T08:29:02  <RossPatterson> Yeah, "hundreds of thousands" seems fair.  My best guess, which I think adamg(r)oucher would probably agree with, is that there are 10-100 IDE users for every RC user.
2011-03-17T08:29:25  <RossPatterson> That or the RC users are damned silent.
2011-03-17T08:29:25  <antlong> well you know
2011-03-17T08:29:33  <antlong> you would have to count browsermob and sauce users also
2011-03-17T08:29:57  <jimevans> i'm having a discussion with someone about the project in about a half-hour, and i want to make sure i don't misrepresent it.
2011-03-17T08:29:57  <RossPatterson> Depends on your purpose.  I smell a slide being made :-)
2011-03-17T08:30:34  <True_Blue> There's a lot of people here who use IDE, and only a few who have moved on to RC.  Anecdotal evidence
2011-03-17T08:30:56  <True_Blue> A lot of people will even download the IDE just so they can say they have some Selenium knowledge
2011-03-17T08:31:15  <antlong> seems like most who stick with ide, dont know / dont care to know a programming language
2011-03-17T08:31:29  <RossPatterson> I peek at every email sent to selenium-users.  They are almost entirely IDE-focused.  There's some RC, and a few Se2.
2011-03-17T08:31:55  <True_Blue> that's exactly true.  When I was showing someone WebDriver, they asked if there was a GUI for it
2011-03-17T08:32:56  * jimevans starts to make a provocative/borderline offensive comment, but thinks better of it.
2011-03-17T08:33:22  <True_Blue> to me?

2011-03-17T08:34:13  *** fuzzygroove has quit IRC
2011-03-17T08:34:29  <RossPatterson> Just checked my deleted mail - there were 87 emails to selenium-users yesterday.  FWIW.
2011-03-17T08:35:01  <True_Blue> Again, a lot of people on different teams here have used the IDE.  And only a couple have used RC.  I think its some of the setup curve also, with the IDE all you have to do is install a plugin
2011-03-17T08:35:11  <True_Blue> With RC, you have to actually get it up and running
2011-03-17T08:35:52  <RossPatterson> We're exactly opposite, but we're a small operation (~80 staff in the whole company), and we set the bar above IDE on purpose.
2011-03-17T08:36:27  <True_Blue> Well, we have tried to help steer people more towards something more sustainable.  Its a work in progress trying to bring people around
2011-03-17T08:36:33  <True_Blue> Several of them still want to use RC
2011-03-17T08:36:38  <True_Blue> I'm the only one using WebDriver
2011-03-17T08:36:39  <AutomatedTester> see you guys in a bit
2011-03-17T08:36:44  <RossPatterson> Plus, we drove Selenium use in from the Development side of the house, not the QA side.  If it had started in QA, we might have been primarily IDE (we were replacing HP's QuickTest Pro)/
2011-03-17T08:36:52  *** AutomatedTester has quit IRC
2011-03-17T08:37:14  <antlong> jimevans, tear me up
2011-03-17T08:37:46  <jimevans> no, i believe if you're not willing to learn a programming language, you're not serious about automated testing.
2011-03-17T08:37:52  <True_Blue> Our IT QA have Quality Center, and they basically don't have any clue what they want.  They like RC because there's a plugin that outputs nice..
2011-03-17T08:38:09  <True_Blue> I have been trying to steer them more towards WebDriver
2011-03-17T08:38:13  <antlong> jimevans, right - but theres a lot of people who will still get a paycheck just by using IDE, without ever learning more
2011-03-17T08:38:19  *** fuzzygroove has joined #selenium
2011-03-17T08:38:54  <RossPatterson> jimevans: Amen.
2011-03-17T08:38:58  <jimevans> until you're ready to refactor your test scripts into reusable and maintainable components, you're just playing around.
2011-03-17T08:39:13  <antlong> jimevans, sure. thats what seperates the men from the boys
2011-03-17T08:39:43  <antlong> part of the problem is though, selenium is a buzz word, and people who hire for automation jobs dont know enough to want more than IDE, because to them, record and play 'makes sense'
2011-03-17T08:39:57  <antlong> its visual
2011-03-17T08:40:07  <True_Blue> Thats good if you have developers who are working on automation.  If you have QA driven automation though, its hard to find QA Engineers who can program
2011-03-17T08:40:16  <antlong> and most hiring managers, and even non-technical higher ups like to 'see' things
2011-03-17T08:40:24  <jimevans> yeah, but "record and play" is never that. it's "record, play once, and edit when it inevitably breaks"
2011-03-17T08:40:31  <Archdude> yeah
2011-03-17T08:40:55  <xirkus> True_Blue: QA Engineers who can't program are not Engineers.
2011-03-17T08:40:56  <Archdude> i love when people think it's as simple as selecting record and clicking on things
2011-03-17T08:40:57  <antlong> jimevans, heh :) but theyll throw more resources in to making it work again in IDE instead of using rc
2011-03-17T08:41:36  <jimevans> antlong: which, as has been shown time and time again through case study after case study, is "penny wise and pound foolish"
2011-03-17T08:41:50  <True_Blue> I understand, what I am saying is here, they have had a problem finding enough people to fill those roles, so they move on to trying to use simpler tools, which means they dont have as good of tests

2011-03-17T08:47:23  *** Archdude has joined #selenium
2011-03-17T08:47:40  <xirkus> True_Blue: instead of moving from manual tests to automation, perhaps you should consider putting a BDD abstraction layer over the top of your framework. I'm in the process of binding JBehave to an underlying test framework that uses WebDriver.
2011-03-17T08:47:46  <RossPatterson> True_Blue: Good model.  I find QA folks tend to do a much better job defining test cases than developers do.
2011-03-17T08:48:08  <xirkus> True_Blue: this allows QA to create tests using simple text specifications.
2011-03-17T08:48:28  *** Archdude has quit IRC
2011-03-17T08:48:34  <True_Blue> We've had instances of where the Dev kind of stare at the page, trying to figure out what they need to check for.  This way, they are fed the manual test cases and they just need to build out what is indicated.
2011-03-17T08:49:09  <True_Blue> hmm it sounds interesting xirkus, but I dont know anything about BDD abstraction layer
2011-03-17T08:49:13  *** Archdude has joined #selenium
2011-03-17T08:49:20  <xirkus> True_Blue: unfortunately, without an adequate abstraction (such as elements on a page), tests like this are brittle.
2011-03-17T08:49:32  <True_Blue> ahh
2011-03-17T08:49:33  <antlong> BDD shouldnt be done by QA
2011-03-17T08:49:54  <RossPatterson> Out of curiousity: do you have problems staffing up that "test developer" role?  Most folks I've known would consider it an entry-level position, and would plan on becoming a "real developer" soon.
2011-03-17T08:50:11  <antlong> makes no sense to write tests against 1) something that doesn't exist yet 2) something you dont know how it will be implemented 3) somehting that could change 100 times before its 'ready for qa'
2011-03-17T08:50:23  <RossPatterson> xirkus: Page Objects are a far-too-little-understood concept.  They rock.
2011-03-17T08:50:30  <xirkus> antlong: my goal is to provide enough tools so that business case tests can be modelled by someone more familiar to the domain instead of programmers.
2011-03-17T08:51:11  <antlong> RossPatterson, i forked towards python dev in QA because it worked in the best interest of my career goals, and also made a lot of sense with my previous experience at agencies and such
2011-03-17T08:51:11  <RossPatterson> antlong: What's your opinion on Test Driven Development?
2011-03-17T08:51:27  <RossPatterson> antlong: Cool!
2011-03-17T08:51:29  <antlong> RossPatterson, same arguement as TDD
2011-03-17T08:51:34  <antlong> sorry BDD
2011-03-17T08:51:53  <RossPatterson> antlong: Thought so.  I'm on the fence, but I sorta agree.
2011-03-17T08:51:57  <antlong> i dont think QA folks can effectively utilize TDD. also its a waste of money for the company
2011-03-17T08:52:05  <antlong> then you have to have 2 people working around each other
2011-03-17T08:52:26  <antlong> my goal ultimately is just to do straight software dev
2011-03-17T08:52:32  <antlong> i hate web dev with a burning passion

2011-03-17T09:14:10  *** csanchez has joined #selenium
2011-03-17T09:16:41  <xirkus> True_Blue: testing != automation. I would equate the use of the IDE as semi-automatic automation; tests which cannot survive application refactoring become manual when they must be re-written. Most automation efforts fail because of this lack of distinction.
2011-03-17T09:18:35  *** sfbrian has joined #selenium
2011-03-17T09:19:09  <True_Blue> I feel like all the false negatives cause a huge problem of getting people to be able to rely upon automation.  When dev's have ran automation scripts and seen a bunch of things fail sometimes and pass others, they lose faith in the process and usually try not to utilize it
2011-03-17T09:19:34  <True_Blue> IDE just has too many
2011-03-17T09:19:37  <True_Blue> to be reliable
2011-03-17T09:19:56  <xirkus> True_Blue: automation requires knowledge of the ENTIRE application; generally this means knowing all of the layers in an N-tier application (including the application / database layers).
2011-03-17T09:21:02  <xirkus> True_Blue: those false negatives are because of how the original Selenium work : proxy injection. This leads to many race conditions since the DOM may not always be in a consistent state; this is especially true for a web app that uses ajax.
2011-03-17T09:21:59  <xirkus> the WebDriver Wait implementation is cleaner.
2011-03-17T09:21:59  <True_Blue> We use a lot of Ajax
2011-03-17T09:22:10  <True_Blue> I am using the WebDriver wait
2011-03-17T09:22:14  <xirkus> hence the non-reproducibility of the tests.
2011-03-17T09:22:27  <True_Blue> But I'm not seeing much reason to use it over the implicit waits
2011-03-17T09:22:35  <True_Blue> I'm not doing anything special on the waits
2011-03-17T09:22:43  <True_Blue> So it seems the implicit wait will do what I need it to
2011-03-17T09:24:31  <xirkus> the WebDriver Wait does not throw exceptions when it retries and can be configured with a timeout that does not affect general test execution.
2011-03-17T09:25:09  <True_Blue> hmm
2011-03-17T09:25:54  *** d_roge has quit IRC
2011-03-17T09:26:03  *** dave_miles has quit IRC
2011-03-17T09:26:55  <True_Blue> Well I am currently utilize the WebDriver wait, but I am testing out my tests with implicit waits and seeing it it affects anything
2011-03-17T09:27:14  <xirkus> I wrapped the RemoteWebElement with Wait so that they execute only when the element is visible.
2011-03-17T09:27:36  <xirkus> this saves having to determine when the page DOM is in a valid state.
2011-03-17T09:27:37  <antlong> thats what implicit wait does anyway
2011-03-17T09:27:42  *** Spanktar has joined #selenium
2011-03-17T09:28:05  <antlong> it waits for the driver to find the element for some amount of time, before trying the next command
2011-03-17T09:28:23  <xirkus> implicit wait does not work for me; we load a lot of data via ajax, so that the element is question may not be rendered when first navigating to a page.
2011-03-17T09:28:35  <antlong> so set the wait time longer
2011-03-17T09:28:57  <xirkus> antlong: I did, via the Wait.
2011-03-17T09:29:25  <antlong> then each command will wait for the element youre trying to interact with to be present before continuing
2011-03-17T09:30:18  <xirkus> antlong: not all commands. I have two interfaces; one with waits, the other without. I only need it for certain page elements.
2011-03-17T09:30:26  <True_Blue> We are having problems with StaleElementReferenceException's, I believe from the AJAX calls
2011-03-17T09:30:35  <antlong> xirkus, it doesnt make sense not use it.
2011-03-17T09:30:47  <antlong> xirkus, if the element is there immediately, there is no discernable difference in speed.
2011-03-17T09:31:13  <antlong> True_Blue, you have to reinitialize the page object if you change its attributes.
2011-03-17T09:31:30  <xirkus> the Wait interface works similarly; if it succeeds, to does not wait; it only retries if necessary.
2011-03-17T09:31:46  <xirkus> s/to/it
2011-03-17T09:32:18  <antlong> you reinvented the wheel my friend
2011-03-17T09:32:22  <antlong> thats what implciit wait does
2011-03-17T09:32:40  <xirkus> only followed the WebDriver documentation.
2011-03-17T09:33:13  <xirkus> I was getting element could not be found exceptions; hence the Waits.
2011-03-17T09:34:31  <antlong> because the default timeout was probably too low
2011-03-17T09:35:04  <True_Blue> The second field on the page is populated based on the first field.  So after I chose something from the first field, its trying to choose an option in the second field, and its throwing a StaleElementReference
2011-03-17T09:35:14  <True_Blue> Because its going too fast
2011-03-17T09:35:21  <True_Blue> the page reloads
2011-03-17T09:37:36  <True_Blue> Even say on a Calculator page, if I type in options in the different fields and then click Calculate, in IE I have the problem that the assert goes to the Total field and pulls that value in, which is 0, before the action on clicking the button is done giving the total to the Total field
2011-03-17T09:38:15  <True_Blue> So I've made asserts that basically find the Element, see if its equal to some text, if its not, find the element again, see if its equal to the text, etc..doing it 5 times, and then eventually quitting out
2011-03-17T09:38:20  <antlong> so dont assert
2011-03-17T09:38:32  <antlong> assert should only be done when you know you have some data
2011-03-17T09:38:40  <xirkus> True_Blue: as per antlong's comment; you need to findElement again - otherwise the StaleElementReferenceExcpetion.
2011-03-17T09:38:50  <True_Blue> Right, which is built into my asserts
2011-03-17T09:39:09  <True_Blue> So I have an assert, which is assertElementTextEquals(By locator, String str)
2011-03-17T09:39:18  <True_Blue> I pass in the By and the text I am asserting it
2011-03-17T09:39:27  <True_Blue> I have it find the element and get the text
2011-03-17T09:39:33  <True_Blue> And if its not equal, it does it again
2011-03-17T09:39:36  <True_Blue> Until 5 times is done
2011-03-17T09:39:53  <True_Blue> after 5 if it hasnt found it, it throws the Exception
2011-03-17T09:39:58  <True_Blue> Saying they arent equal
2011-03-17T09:40:18  <xirkus> this method is trying to do to many things at once. refactor - element resolution should not be part of the assertion.
2011-03-17T09:41:42  <True_Blue> I honestly dont know a way around it.  If I do a click, then do a findElement.getText(), and then assert on the text, it will throw a StaleElementReferenceException in the assert
2011-03-17T09:42:14  <True_Blue> I basically have to have my assert keep cycling through a couple of times to make sure it has the element from the page after the click
2011-03-17T09:42:16  <antlong> True_Blue, because once you do the click, the original object is stale
2011-03-17T09:42:16  <xirkus> wrong order. get the element first, then assert.
2011-03-17T09:42:43  <antlong> you cant assign a name to a paeg object, then do something to it, then do more operations on it
2011-03-17T09:42:57  <xirkus> essentially your assertion method has an unintended side effect.
2011-03-17T09:43:02  <antlong> the page object has changed, and the pointer to it is no longer accurate
2011-03-17T09:43:20  <True_Blue> I know that on a click it is no longer valid
2011-03-17T09:43:23  <antlong> the pointer doesnt update when you alter the page object, its just a reference
2011-03-17T09:43:28  <True_Blue> Its the browser that is going too quickly.
2011-03-17T09:43:35  <True_Blue> I have it click, then find the element, then assert
2011-03-17T09:43:37  <antlong> True_Blue, get the object by_whatever again, then click it
2011-03-17T09:43:42  <True_Blue> Before the click is done, its done the find the element
2011-03-17T09:44:37  <True_Blue> so I have: button_element.click(); String foo = field_element.getText(); assertElementTextEquals(foo, "244");
2011-03-17T09:44:51  <True_Blue> its populating foo from the previous page, before the click
2011-03-17T09:45:03  <True_Blue> Even though its after the click()
2011-03-17T09:45:18  <antlong> no
2011-03-17T09:45:24  <antlong> you changed the object
2011-03-17T09:45:39  <antlong> once you do click on it, the reference is stale. the object has changed.
2011-03-17T09:45:56  <True_Blue> So how would you write it?
2011-03-17T09:46:03  <True_Blue> oh
2011-03-17T09:46:05  <antlong> >.<
2011-03-17T09:46:15  <True_Blue> I added the variables for speed
2011-03-17T09:46:20  <True_Blue> I'm not actually using variables
2011-03-17T09:47:09  <antlong> you have to do, find_element_by_id or whatever, again, after you click it
2011-03-17T09:47:29  <True_Blue> driver.findElement(By.id("Calculate")).click; assertElementTextEquals(driver.find(By.id("total)).getText(), "244");
2011-03-17T09:47:35  <True_Blue> that's the real code I was using
2011-03-17T09:47:50  <True_Blue> driver.findElement(By.id("Calculate")).click; assertElementTextEquals(driver.findElement(By.id("total)).getText(), "244");
2011-03-17T09:47:50  <antlong> use variables for one
2011-03-17T09:47:52  <True_Blue> Sorry
2011-03-17T09:48:15  <True_Blue> So i am grabbing the element *after* the click
2011-03-17T09:48:22  <True_Blue> And its getting that element from the page before the click
2011-03-17T09:48:27  <antlong> you need to re-get the element after the click
2011-03-17T09:48:34  <antlong> also
2011-03-17T09:48:38  <antlong> youre missing a quote in there
2011-03-17T09:48:49  <antlong> >.>
2011-03-17T09:49:58  <True_Blue> Even this will cause the StaleElementReference:
2011-03-17T09:50:00  <True_Blue>     		driver.findElement(By.id("Calculate")).click;
2011-03-17T09:50:00  <True_Blue>     		WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("Total")).getText();
2011-03-17T09:50:00  <True_Blue>     		assertElementTextEquals(element, "244");
2011-03-17T09:50:31  <True_Blue> Finding the Element after the click, still causes it to find the element from the first page
2011-03-17T09:50:52  <True_Blue> So in the asserts, I built it to look several times, so I can be reasonably sure it grabbed the right one

2011-03-17T09:53:03  <True_Blue> I have waits build around it.  The element always is found because it exists on the page before the click and after the click
2011-03-17T09:53:13  <True_Blue> xirkus: yeah it does a reload
2011-03-17T09:53:27  <True_Blue> wait is not the problem.  Its not bombing out because it can't find it
2011-03-17T09:53:31  <xirkus> finding it does not mean it is valid for the CURRENT PAGE.

Again, its doing the click, and then before the page has changed, its going to the next line which is where I'm getting the element, so it grabs the element before the page has reloaded.  Since the element exists on the old page too, it finds it.  It gets the old value, then in my assert, the assert is telling it how you dont have
2011-03-17T10:00:43  <True_Blue> the right value, then when it reaches my throw Exception line in my assert, it throws an error saying StaleElementReference
2011-03-17T10:01:06  <True_Blue> In Firefox, firefox seems to not move on to finding the element till after click() has finished
2011-03-17T10:01:16  <True_Blue> So when I find the element and then assert, they have the correct values
2011-03-17T10:01:25  <True_Blue> The same exact code, two different outcomes
2011-03-17T10:02:14  <xirkus> WebDriver uses the browser's API for automation; different browsers will likely have different implementations.
2011-03-17T10:03:15  <jimevans> True_Blue: sorry, i missed the first part of the conversation. which is the problematic browser?
2011-03-17T10:03:23  <True_Blue> Yeah.  So to get around the little problem I saw, I just edited my asserts to do the getting of the element, and then if its not equal, wait a second and then get the element again, and so on until 5 times.  If it still isnt equal, I know with relatively safety that they wont be and throw an Exception
2011-03-17T10:04:00  *** gronky has quit IRC
2011-03-17T10:05:25  <True_Blue> Maybe its not good practice to have the getting of the element within the assert, but I dont know of a better way to get around it, so its how I'm doing it right now.  I dont know that its stale until I try doing something with it
2011-03-17T10:11:23  <xirkus> True_Blue: I always assume that all references are stale and resolve the element on use.
2011-03-17T10:11:55  <True_Blue> I'm not sure what you mean
2011-03-17T10:12:16  <True_Blue> right before the assert, I'm grabbing the element
2011-03-17T10:12:33  <True_Blue> Its not like I'm grabbing the element, doing a bunch of other stuff, and then doing the assert
2011-03-17T10:15:34  <xirkus> I mean that I have an Element(Page Object) abstraction layer that resolves the element when ever it is used. No cached references.
2011-03-17T10:18:30  <True_Blue> I understand, but I'm not doing a cached reference either.  I'm literally getting the element the line above the assert
2011-03-17T10:19:15  <True_Blue> Its cool, I've found a work around
2011-03-17T10:19:18  <True_Blue> and it works
2011-03-17T10:19:24  <True_Blue> So thats what matters the most

2011-03-17T11:03:45  * AutomatedTester has a lot of questions... might just wait for the podcast
2011-03-17T11:04:03  <jimevans> he hadn't used the project in 5 or 6 years, so he was totally unaware of anything beyond the HTML/selenese format
2011-03-17T11:04:27  <jimevans> we spent a lot more time on Se1.x than I would've liked.
2011-03-17T11:04:33  <mandric> hello i'm trying to debug some javascript that i'm evaluating in selenium and it's somewhat difficult since i have to make a tweak to the javascript and run the test each time. is there a better way to debug js in selenium?
2011-03-17T11:05:45  <jimevans> I tried to really emphasize the webdriver api, and the creation of watir-webdriver... as well as the new chromedriver and operadriver provided
2011-03-17T11:05:50  <jimevans> by the browser vendors.
2011-03-17T11:06:06  <AutomatedTester> mandric: Se1 or Se2?
2011-03-17T11:06:12  <mandric> i've been hacking up selenium tests for a while, it might be good to get some training actually... does anyone have recommendations on good reads?
2011-03-17T11:06:16  <mandric> AutomatedTester: Se2
2011-03-17T11:06:37  <mandric> but i don't think i'm using any of the Se2 features yet
2011-03-17T11:06:38  <AutomatedTester> mandric get your JS right in Firebug and then copy paste into your test
2011-03-17T11:06:50  <mandric> strange thing is it works in firebug
2011-03-17T11:06:55  <AutomatedTester> it doesnt use the browserbot access methods
2011-03-17T11:07:08  <mandric> but for some reason i'm not getting the same result in selenium
2011-03-17T11:07:15  <AutomatedTester> hmm
2011-03-17T11:07:23  <mandric> i can post my js if u want to take a look
2011-03-17T11:07:27  <AutomatedTester> in *theory* it should just work
2011-03-17T11:07:37  <mandric> yea, that's my typical workflow

2011-03-17T11:11:34  *** AutomatedTester has quit IRC
2011-03-17T11:11:54  <mandric> there are a couple extra out.push() calls in there because i'm debugging right now
2011-03-17T11:12:44  <jimevans> mandric: so what's failing? what's working in firebug that doesn't in your test case?
2011-03-17T11:14:30  <jimevans> oh, wait, I though you said you were using the se2 API.
2011-03-17T11:16:19  <mandric> the getPropertyValue('background-image') always returns none
2011-03-17T11:16:36  *** csanchez has quit IRC
2011-03-17T11:16:46  <mandric> i'm running se2, but i don't know what version of the API i'm using (i mean i assume se1)
2011-03-17T11:16:58  *** csanchez has joined #selenium
2011-03-17T11:17:08  <jimevans> when you execute the script in your test, what does the line of code in your test look like?
2011-03-17T11:17:47  <mandric> it's exactly the same (minus the extra debug calls)
2011-03-17T11:18:05  <mandric> maybe i'm not on the page i think i am or something ... looking
2011-03-17T11:18:34  <mandric> yea it's just strange since any page on the site uses background-image heavily
2011-03-17T11:19:15  <mandric> and i can see all the right objects (dom elements) get traversed just the property value does not correspond
2011-03-17T11:20:40  <jimevans> let me back up a step to make sure i understand the whole scenario. what language is your test script in?
2011-03-17T11:20:51  <mandric> python
2011-03-17T11:21:44  <jimevans> ok. so when you copy-paste the javascript into firebug, it works correctly?

2011-03-17T11:25:14  <jimevans> well i don't see anything in the js that would necessarily be problematic, but i'm flying double-blind here (don't know python, don't really know the 1.x api)
2011-03-17T11:27:00  <mandric> i'd like to learn more about 2.x api, thought that might have some better ways to deal with js.
2011-03-17T11:27:21  <mandric> but it doesn't sound like there would be much difference regarding this problem.
2011-03-17T11:28:07  *** fuzzygroove has joined #selenium
2011-03-17T11:30:27  *** csanchez has quit IRC
2011-03-17T11:36:01  <RossPatterson> mandric: That looks like it ought to work, with one caveat.  In Selenium 1, "document" isn't necessarily what you expect it to be.
2011-03-17T11:37:38  <RossPatterson> You're probably running this in the wrong window as a result.
2011-03-17T11:38:10  *** fuzzygroove has quit IRC
2011-03-17T11:38:55  <RossPatterson> I'd use "window.document" instead.  Selenium goes out of its way to ensure that "window" is set to the application's current window when running code in getEval().
2011-03-17T11:39:07  *** fuzzygroove has joined #selenium
2011-03-17T11:40:59  <mandric> i had a similar thought and thought i tried that (trying again)
2011-03-17T11:42:12  <mandric> so where do i start when the desire strikes to learn about Se2?
2011-03-17T11:45:19  <RossPatterson> Right now, the API docs are all there is (Java: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/index.html; Ruby: http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/index.html).  I understand the doc team is working on the equivalent of the Se1 doc.
2011-03-17T11:46:20  *** dhackner has quit IRC
2011-03-17T11:46:32  <mandric> RossPatterson: yea window.document doesn't seem to make a difference... hrmf looking
2011-03-17T11:47:01  <mandric> thanks for the links
2011-03-17T11:48:03  <RossPatterson> OK, that's odd.
2011-03-17T11:48:29  <RossPatterson> You understand the two-window Se1 structure?
2011-03-17T11:49:21  <RossPatterson> Code run via getEval() is run in the Selenium control window, not in the application's window, so "document" is TestRunner.html (or its equivalent).
2011-03-17T11:49:38  <mandric> oh i think you found my bug ...
2011-03-17T11:50:41  <mandric> no i was not familiar
2011-03-17T11:51:27  <mandric> yea, window.document fixed it.
2011-03-17T11:51:38  <mandric> this was enlightening, thanks.
2011-03-17T11:53:51  <mandric> in my other javascript stuff i'm using jquery like so var _jq=this.browserbot.getCurrentWindow().$;
2011-03-17T11:54:12  <mandric> so this was my first use of document/DOM...

2011-03-17T12:00:03  *** dhackner has joined #selenium
2011-03-17T12:00:05  <RossPatterson> Actually, ignoring error handling, getEval() is exactly: var window = this.browserbot.getCurrentWindow();

2011-03-17T12:32:55  <jimevans> but i think i hit the high points.
2011-03-17T12:33:04  <simonstewart> Excellent :)
2011-03-17T12:33:47  <jimevans> in retrospect, i think we spent too long on 1.x, but i tried to focus on 2.0.
2011-03-17T12:34:06  <simonstewart> 1.x is what people already know
2011-03-17T12:34:18  <simonstewart> It's hard to let that go
2011-03-17T12:34:41  <jimevans> true, and scott was coming at it from the perspective of someone who hasn't touched the project in 5 or 6 years
2011-03-17T12:34:59  <jimevans> so he was very much in the HTML table/Selenese command mindset.
2011-03-17T12:35:05  *** fuzzygroove has joined #selenium
2011-03-17T12:35:07  <jimevans> At the beginning, at least.
2011-03-17T12:35:11  <simonstewart> That'll be a big shift
2011-03-17T12:35:53  <jimevans> we covered some of the history, which I'm sure I got wrong, but we also covered the relationship between selenium and watir.
2011-03-17T12:36:13  <jimevans> and the "webdriver as automation standard", which is what i really wanted out ther.
2011-03-17T12:36:14  <RossPatterson> Well, now I'll finally have a reason to listen to one of those podcasts!
2011-03-17T12:36:20  <simonstewart> That's a lot of ground in half an hour

2011-03-17T12:37:11  <jimevans> I've got to hand it to Hanselman, he really focuses on content during his podcast, so I'm always getting something useful out of it.
2011-03-17T12:37:43  <simonstewart> I stopped listening a while ago, but I should start again
2011-03-17T12:37:47  <simonstewart> Any idea when it'll be up?
2011-03-17T12:38:14  <jimevans> as soon as they get it edited together.
2011-03-17T12:38:28  <jimevans> I recorded my end with a local microphone as well as via the phone and sent them the audio, so it should have decent sound quality.
2011-03-17T12:38:47  <simonstewart> That's the radio stuff you do coming out
2011-03-17T12:39:13  <jimevans> well, he asked, and i had the equipment from radio and song demo recording. :)
2011-03-17T12:39:35  <simonstewart> lol
2011-03-17T12:39:45  <jimevans> turns out, he's a bit of an audio quality snob. (in a good way)
2011-03-17T12:40:20  <antlong> is there a speed difference between the same firefox version, same test, mac vs windows?
2011-03-17T12:40:47  <simonstewart> depends, but they should be pretty close

2011-03-17T12:48:28  <simonstewart> Knowing when it broke would help

2011-03-17T13:29:42  <True_Blue> I'm doing a run of my tests using the Wait for Webdriver, and then doing a run using implicit waits, and the Wait class seems not to have a problem, whereas the implicit waits sometimes dont find an element
2011-03-17T13:29:54  <True_Blue> I figured they'd be roughly the same
2011-03-17T13:30:42  <simonstewart> They are roughly the same
2011-03-17T13:31:20  <jimevans> True_Blue: what simonstewart said, except the implicit waits are often implemented in the native driver, which may lead to slightly different behaviour.
2011-03-17T13:31:43  <jimevans> Whereas the Wait class is implemented in the language binding.

2011-03-17T13:42:49  <True_Blue> but not using the Wait class
2011-03-17T13:43:05  <True_Blue> I've run through them several times, with roughly the same results
2011-03-17T13:43:06  <antlong> True_Blue you implicit wait time probably isnt long enough
2011-03-17T13:43:26  <True_Blue> I actually made the implicit wait time 10 seconds, and when using the Wait class I've been doing 5 seconds
2011-03-17T13:43:36  <True_Blue> And it had those results where implicit would throw an error
2011-03-17T13:43:39  <True_Blue> but not the wait class
2011-03-17T13:43:43  <True_Blue> Just kind of interesting
2011-03-17T13:43:58  <antlong> does it seem like it actually waits 10 seconds
2011-03-17T13:44:56  <True_Blue> I really dont know for sure.  I'm runnin about 10 test suites, with 5-7 tests in each one of them, so i dont watch them all run.  After about 5 different runs, the Wait class never returned an Exception saying it couldnt find an element, but the implicit wait did a couple of times each run
2011-03-17T13:45:25  <antlong> you have to do some debugging

2011-03-17T13:50:13  <jimevans> True_Blue: three questions. what language do you write your tests in? how are you finding the elements? does it work in firefox?

2011-03-17T13:52:43  *** kylls has quit IRC
2011-03-17T13:53:32  <True_Blue> Well it looks like it just happened using the Wait class.
2011-03-17T13:53:41  <True_Blue> I write everything in Java
2011-03-17T13:54:02  <True_Blue> I find elements with findElement when using implicit waits, and I use a custom method of waitForElement when I am using the wait class
2011-03-17T13:54:21  <True_Blue> And I havent run the implicit waits in Firefox yet, but Firefox seems to handle most things a lot better
2011-03-17T13:54:36  *** jledbetter has left #selenium
2011-03-17T13:55:04  <antlong> True_Blue, if youve ran anything on FF recently, it used implicit waits
2011-03-17T13:55:14  <antlong> i think the default is 5 seconds or so
2011-03-17T13:55:19  <jimevans> True_Blue: Specifically what locator are you using to find the elements? Since IE does not have native handling for xpath and css selectors, there is special-case code for this.
2011-03-17T13:55:39  <simonstewart> antlong: the default is 0 second
2011-03-17T13:55:40  <simonstewart> s
2011-03-17T13:55:49  <antlong> simonstewart, really?
2011-03-17T13:55:59  <simonstewart> Yeah
2011-03-17T13:56:08  <antlong> why for
2011-03-17T13:56:09  <simonstewart> All drivers start with the implicit wait cranked down to 0
2011-03-17T13:56:16  <simonstewart> so that it mirrors existing behaviour
2011-03-17T13:56:19  <antlong> ah
2011-03-17T13:56:26  <simonstewart> following the "principle of least surprise"
2011-03-17T13:56:40  <antlong> that is indeed a good principle
2011-03-17T13:56:53  <simonstewart> I try and follow it sometimes
2011-03-17T13:56:54  <antlong> i thought i saw 5000 ms in the py bindings, im probably wrong though
2011-03-17T13:57:05  <simonstewart> Not read the python bindings too careful
2011-03-17T13:57:09  <simonstewart> You may be right
2011-03-17T13:57:22  <simonstewart> But if you are, I'll crank it back down again :)
2011-03-17T13:57:36  <antlong> simonstewart, did we need another platform for builds?
2011-03-17T13:57:48  <simonstewart> ?
2011-03-17T13:58:10  <antlong> the build system, i thought someone asked if anyone could contribute hardware to run build tests on
2011-03-17T13:58:20  <antlong> for bamboo
2011-03-17T13:58:27  <simonstewart> Ahhh.... 'tis a good question
2011-03-17T13:58:39  <simonstewart> I'd dearly love those builds to be stable
2011-03-17T13:58:46  <simonstewart> I'm tempted to nuke anything that isn't
2011-03-17T13:58:51  <simonstewart> and start adding the builds back one by one
