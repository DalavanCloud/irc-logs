2011-08-01T00:27:01  <pngl> Does send_keys implicitly wait on ajax? If I use send_keys on a field which auto-triggers an an ajax request, my next Webdriver commands aren't processed until that request is complete. Is it possible to avoid that behaviour?
2011-08-01T00:31:06  <pngl> I've tried changing implicit_wait and script_wait to 1 and it stayed the same.

2011-08-01T02:03:55  <eranm> pngl, implicit wait will not help here - it's only for waiting for an element to exist.
2011-08-01T02:04:09  <eranm> pngl, you should implement a condition that is passed to a WebDriverWait.

2011-08-01T02:24:09  <eranm> pngl, how is WebDriver supposed to figure out the exact condition, specific to your test, that should be met before the test should proceed?

2011-08-01T02:29:02  <eranm> On Firefox we use synthesized events, not native ones - it may do less waiting with native events (which are unavailable on Mac). However, the explicit waiting is only for page loads, not other AJAX requests AFAIK

2011-08-01T02:31:38  <pngl> eranm: what precisely happens is that I send_keys to a file_upload field. This field is event bound to start uploading as soon as it is modified and to show an upload meter during the process. Then, when the upload is complete, it updates a DIV to show the newly uploaded item. I'm trying to test the presence of the upload bar, but Selenium only resumes command execution *after* the upload has completed and the div was updated, so the upload mete
2011-08-01T02:31:38  <pngl> r is already gone.
2011-08-01T02:37:47  <eranm> Ah, a file upload is a special case in send_keys. I can't think of a way to change WebDriver's behaviour, but perhaps you can have some code in the page that would look for the presence of the upload meter and later use executeScript to find out what this code reported.

2011-08-01T05:54:01  <eranm> This issue depends on several things: whether native events are used, which version of Firefox is used, which event handlers are on the element(s) interacted with.
2011-08-01T05:54:19  <eranm> There may be an issue there, but without an explicit test case it'd be hard to debug.

2011-08-01T05:55:34  <eranm> Since I've been working with native events a lot I'd like to go in and fix the problem, but the Google.com site is not a good example - the element having focus is not enough.

2011-08-01T05:56:06  <eranm> This is exactly where a hermetic test-case would help - it would show *exactly* what you expect send_keys(Keys.Tab) to do.
2011-08-01T05:56:49  <eranm> (otherwise I may end up fixing the wrong thing or just changing the behaviour in a way that would still not help you).
2011-08-01T05:57:21  <eranm> It's also very valuable to know in which releases it worked as you expected and in which releases it didn't - all of this information is missing from the bug.

2011-08-01T06:15:46  <dawagner> We import the atoms in to firefoxDriver in the constructor (whereas in wrappedElement, which does use preconditions, we import it in global)
2011-08-01T06:16:08  <dawagner> But I'm trying to set the preconditions in global scope, so they're not loaded
2011-08-01T06:16:24  <simonstewart> And we do the import in the constructor because Firefox has wonky behaviour if you load the imports too soon
2011-08-01T06:16:50  <dawagner> Ugh, I really don't want to add preconditions in the constructor, that's nowhere near the method definition :(
2011-08-01T06:17:08  <simonstewart> No, we do the imports in the constructor
2011-08-01T06:17:22  <dawagner> Yeah, but I can't add the preconditions until the import is done
2011-08-01T06:18:40  <Ajay> in SeleneseTestNgHelper  setUp should also throw an Exception

2011-08-01T06:33:10  <adamgoucher> did anything else get atomized? or was it just a refactoring?
2011-08-01T06:33:39  <simonstewart> more "recoding" than "refactoring"

2011-08-01T10:28:05  <tunabum> Ajay: another team member (usually MichaelTamm) will create the maven artifacts off the branch and push them to the central repo... he's not always around immediately when the release happens, but has been pretty good about it lately
2011-08-01T10:28:07  <XRayCulver> I realize you guys are pushing a release right now, but does anybody have a few minutes to answer some questions about PageFactory in .Net?
2011-08-01T10:28:47  <simonstewart> Ajay: tunabum has it right
2011-08-01T10:29:45  <adamgoucher> the website will be updated in a bit -- messing with bamboo right now
2011-08-01T10:29:52  <Ajay> :) is there plan to automate the maven

2011-08-01T11:29:47  <adamgoucher> ok. that was less painful than last time. bamboo now a version 3.2 (current; though 3.3 should be out in a bit) and all four agents are updated and running
2011-08-01T11:29:51  *** Rotham__ is now known as rotham
2011-08-01T11:30:01  <simonstewart> Which agents?
2011-08-01T11:30:19  * simonstewart loads the bamboo home page
2011-08-01T11:30:33  <adamgoucher> linux, xp, osx for building the project and the sehq one for the website and docs
2011-08-01T11:31:11  *** Ajay_ has joined #selenium
2011-08-01T11:32:01  <adamgoucher> in the 3.x server, we should, in theory, be able to better chain builds to reduce the amount of the internets that are downloaded and for speed improvements
2011-08-01T11:32:11  <simonstewart> Yay!
2011-08-01T11:32:17  *** Ajay has quit IRC
2011-08-01T11:32:21  <simonstewart> Can they start VM images on demand?
2011-08-01T11:32:36  <adamgoucher> that, i do not know. :P
2011-08-01T11:32:56  <simonstewart> I could really do with that as a built in feature
2011-08-01T11:33:10  <simonstewart> Might ping the Atlassian guys to see if they know if it's possible

2011-08-01T11:33:24  <adamgoucher> i'll ping the bamboo lead when he wakes up
2011-08-01T11:33:35  <simonstewart> That'd be good
2011-08-01T11:33:49  <simonstewart> If bamboo can build our project, it can cope with a lot of stuff
2011-08-01T11:34:04  <adamgoucher> in theory though, what you do is have the agent run a command against the vmware server to start the snapshot
2011-08-01T11:34:31  <simonstewart> hmmm
2011-08-01T11:34:36  <simonstewart> I may actually have to read some docs
2011-08-01T11:35:07  <adamgoucher> you can do pre/post actions on a build. the trick would be to say 'start this vm /and then use it/'
2011-08-01T11:35:54  <adamgoucher> its less than helpful when google returns my email to se-dev on the subject

2011-08-01T11:52:21  <adamgoucher> put it on the sehq site -- and then stop pointing people at google code
2011-08-01T11:52:47  <adamgoucher> the whole having two places to download is unnecessarily confusing i think
2011-08-01T11:54:51  <simonstewart> Is that clear enough: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list
2011-08-01T11:54:57  <simonstewart> adamgoucher: people will always visit both places
2011-08-01T11:55:05  <simonstewart> So documenting in both probably makes sense

2011-08-01T12:06:44  <simonstewart> the idea with merging the ui-map stuff into core was to make it easier to use it
2011-08-01T12:06:54  <simonstewart> But since no-one pushes it, it's withered
2011-08-01T12:07:00  <simonstewart> Meh, I say. Meh.
2011-08-01T12:07:41  <adamgoucher> ya. and its out of scope for 'browser automation' now. ui-map stuff should be handled in script by the runner.

2011-08-01T12:41:50  <AutomatedTester> i would agree webdriver is the way forward
2011-08-01T12:41:56  <lord1234> webdriver?
2011-08-01T12:42:15  <hubc> http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver
2011-08-01T12:42:20  <hubc> it's selenium 2.0
2011-08-01T12:42:40  <lord1234> http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html  is this it?
2011-08-01T12:42:53  <hubc> that's it
2011-08-01T12:43:04  <hubc> instead of using a javascript frame to contorl the browser like RC
2011-08-01T12:43:07  <lord1234> and php is not supported?
2011-08-01T12:43:10  <hubc> it uses built in browser stuff
2011-08-01T12:43:29  <lord1234> I'm currently in an enviroment running a LAMP stack, and as such, they are really trying for PHP
2011-08-01T12:43:52  <hubc> well you can run your selenium test with whatever language you'd like right
2011-08-01T12:43:54  <AutomatedTester> lord1234: dont use php for testing
2011-08-01T12:44:06  <AutomatedTester> and if they want LAMP suggest python over php
2011-08-01T12:44:07  <lord1234> really?  why?
2011-08-01T12:44:29  <lord1234> i've used php and ruby, so it seems ruby might end up being the way to go
2011-08-01T12:44:37  <hubc> goooo ruby!
2011-08-01T12:44:44  <AutomatedTester> lord1234: PHP bindings are not supported by the project
2011-08-01T12:44:51  <lord1234> i see
2011-08-01T12:46:18  <lord1234> and you don't need a Seleniium server running for Webdriver to work?
2011-08-01T12:46:21  <lord1234> can run standalone eh?
2011-08-01T12:46:30  <AutomatedTester> it can
2011-08-01T12:46:41  <AutomatedTester> or you can use remotewebdriver
2011-08-01T12:46:56  <AutomatedTester> which is the same priniciple as RC
2011-08-01T12:47:19  <lord1234> any reason to do one over the other?
2011-08-01T12:47:41  <hubc> lord1234: webdriver controls the browser directly
2011-08-01T12:49:19  <lord1234> anywhere that all the webdriver methods are located?
2011-08-01T12:49:31  <hubc> for ruby?

2011-08-01T12:52:25  <lord1234> I know we discussed this a while back, but any chance for providing "download dialog" support for at least firefox in the future?
