2011-06-24T06:13:25  <stefanf> Hi, I'm using Selenium RC with Perl bindings and it seems that i'm not able to run any tests using Google Chrome. The error message I receive is the following: "Error requesting http://localhost:4444/selenium-server/driver/:
2011-06-24T06:13:25  <stefanf> ERROR: Command execution failure. Please search the forum at http://clearspace.openqa.org for error details from the log window.  The error message is: Cannot convert object to primitive value"
2011-06-24T06:13:33  <stefanf> Could you help me, please?
2011-06-24T06:14:25  <stefanf> for clarification, the "browser" parameter when starting selenium is "*googlechrome"
2011-06-24T06:14:55  <adamgoucher> what version of the server are you using?
2011-06-24T06:15:07  <stefanf> i'm using 2.0rc3
2011-06-24T06:15:17  *** misterncw has joined #selenium
2011-06-24T06:15:22  <stefanf> but have no problems with Firefox or IE
2011-06-24T06:15:37  <stefanf> my script only fails for Chrome
2011-06-24T06:17:02  <stefanf> the command i'm issuing to run the server is the following: java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.0rc3.jar -interactive
2011-06-24T06:17:21  *** Nirdosh has left #selenium
2011-06-24T06:17:43  <adamgoucher> why are you using -interactive?
2011-06-24T06:18:47  <stefanf> just a leftover from when I was trying to issue command directly in the console
2011-06-24T06:20:37  *** gillz has joined #selenium
2011-06-24T06:21:55  <stefanf> i get the same error when trying to run selenium server 1.0.3
2011-06-24T06:22:07  <stefanf> is there something else I should add when starting the server?
2011-06-24T06:22:37  <adamgoucher> in theory, it should just work

2011-06-24T06:31:03  <RossPatterson> barancev suggests: To avoid this error you have to start browser with an option that disables same origin policy (web security) checks:
2011-06-24T06:31:03  <RossPatterson> selenium.start("commandLineFlags=--disable-web-security");
2011-06-24T06:31:20  <stefanf> i just found a similar answer
2011-06-24T06:32:02  <stefanf> i have created a custom application launcher in my home folder, like this: /opt/google/chrome/chrome --disable-web-security
2011-06-24T06:32:19  <stefanf> this works when i double-click it (google chrome launches)
2011-06-24T06:32:32  <stefanf> but selenium server seems to get stuck
2011-06-24T06:32:59  <stefanf>  when setting the "browser" parameter to "*custom /home/myhome/chrome"
2011-06-24T06:33:22  <stefanf> the last message on the console line is "Allocated session 06f90ebe0baf44f5a85d924725a4c50d for http://www.facebook.com, launching..."

2011-06-24T07:05:32  <RossPatterson> What "seleniumhq plugin" do you mean - "seleniumhq" is the website for Selenium, it has lots of plugins.
2011-06-24T07:10:24  <RossPatterson> pngl: Do you mean the "seleniumhq" plugin for Hudson?  That's something the Hudson folks built, Selenium didn't build it.
2011-06-24T07:10:50  <pngl> RossPatterson: yes, I meant that. Ok, i'll go over the selenium chan then :)
2011-06-24T07:11:16  <pngl> RossPatterson: although... would you know how to tell selenium to revert to an old format for html reports?
2011-06-24T07:11:44  <RossPatterson> I don't believe the "htmlsuite" report format has changed.
2011-06-24T07:15:08  <pngl> RossPatterson: oh ok.. I saw some sample reports online a while ago that looked much different from what I have, that's why I was wondering

2011-06-24T10:29:32  <new2b2> hello, I have a hopefully quick question. I am using Selenium Server, programming in Python. I have a piece of selenium code I want to re-use. I am new to both selenium and python. I was thinking to create a function in a different file but since I am running selenium commands from the other file I am not sure how to make sure those commands run on the same browser that the script it was called from is running.
2011-06-24T10:31:06  <new2b2> but it complains about the selenium command being there telling me unbound method is_element_present must be called with selenium instance as first argument (got str instance instead)
2011-06-24T10:31:18  <new2b2> I am at a loss right now how to deal with this
2011-06-24T10:39:00  <rpk> I have a piece of selenium code I want to re-use.  => have you looked at pageobjects and loadable component?

2011-06-24T13:01:49  <tunabum> (as in i provided a patch to that issue... but would obviously need reviewing by the patcher)
2011-06-24T13:08:21  <jimevans> adamgoucher: sorry for the late reply, but yes, if the browser doesn't support it, sizzle gets injected in ie for webdriver.
2011-06-24T13:09:05  *** sylvinus has joined #selenium
2011-06-24T13:09:07  <adamgoucher> but in general, its better scripts not assume sizzle extensions are available (though they could be)
2011-06-24T13:09:41  <jimevans> yes, that's true. don't rely on it. it's far more likely they won't be in use.
2011-06-24T13:10:27  <adamgoucher> i /think/ i actually had the sizzle story straight now :)
2011-06-24T13:12:02  <adamgoucher> somewhere in the docs i think it says that css selector location falls back to sizzle. which while technically correct, is kinda misleading as to what falling back means
2011-06-24T13:12:07  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: sizzle is in Se1 and doesnt delegate down. Well, thats what I understood Hugs did
2011-06-24T13:13:15  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: yes, but its also avail in some versions of ie in webdriver (as i understand jimevans and simon)
2011-06-24T13:13:25  <adamgoucher> though in general, yes
2011-06-24T13:13:51  <AutomatedTester> yea, but we do a test to see if the browser understands CSS selector, if that test passes we use the browser
2011-06-24T13:13:56  <AutomatedTester> otherwise we delegate down
2011-06-24T13:14:54  <adamgoucher> can you clarify 'understands css selector' ? is that in a general sense or a specific one.
2011-06-24T13:15:48  <adamgoucher> if browser understands css selectors in general, use native. if it doesnt (ie7 and below for instance) inject and use sizzle
2011-06-24T13:15:51  <adamgoucher> correct?
2011-06-24T13:15:56  <tunabum> i was just looking at this the other day (to figure it out too)... seems driver specific, but here's ff  http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/firefox-driver/js/utils.js#1296
2011-06-24T13:17:47  <adamgoucher> right. and that jives with my understanding of the world.
2011-06-24T13:18:53  <adamgoucher> however, it could be argued for (though likely unsucessfully) that since the fallback is to use sizzle that catching the 'i dont know wtf you just sent me because it is sizzle specific' exception and then dumping it through sizzle could also be valid
2011-06-24T13:19:46  <jarib> AutomatedTester: back
2011-06-24T13:20:07  <jimevans> adamgoucher: this is the js code that actually gets run in IE when you call findElement(By.cssSelector('...')) - https://gist.github.com/1045612
2011-06-24T13:20:48  <jimevans> the findElements() js code is identical, except that we look for querySelectorAll.
2011-06-24T13:21:25  <AutomatedTester> jarib: i solved it, thanks
2011-06-24T13:22:35  <adamgoucher> yup. also makes sense. but sending p:contains('monkey') doesnt hit sizzle, and would find something according to that logic. it throws an exception. so its a 'we use sizzle, but you cant make use of sizzle' paradox
2011-06-24T13:24:06  * jimevans notes that, with little exception, this code is identical to what it had been before the IE driver rewrite.
2011-06-24T13:24:28  <jimevans> ^^ in other words, i didn't write it.

2011-06-24T13:25:25  <adamgoucher> heh. not blaming anyone. just trying to figure out the non sucky story around sizzle
2011-06-24T13:26:15  <jimevans> adamgoucher: also, if i'm reading it right, if you call WebElement.findElement() using CSS selectors, IE *will* fall back to Sizzle.
2011-06-24T13:26:37  <jarib> jimevans: only for IE7 and below, no?
2011-06-24T13:26:47  <jarib> where querySelector isn't available
2011-06-24T13:26:48  <jimevans> jarib: https://gist.github.com/1045612
2011-06-24T13:27:02  *** mashiara has joined #selenium
2011-06-24T13:27:08  <jarib> right
2011-06-24T13:27:35  <jarib> and the root['querySelector'] condition will pass for IE8-9
2011-06-24T13:27:49  <jimevans> if root is an element and not null?
2011-06-24T13:28:11  <jarib> when will it be null?
2011-06-24T13:28:17  <adamgoucher> at least with firefox (which could be different) it actually throws an WebDriverException saying 'An invalid or illegal string was specified' and not get to the actual Sizzle call
2011-06-24T13:28:39  <jimevans> jarib: root will be null in the WebDriver.findElement case, and non-null in the WebElement.findElement case.
2011-06-24T13:29:13  <jarib> jimevans: root will be the result document.documentElement in the WebDriver.findElement case
2011-06-24T13:29:33  <jimevans> yes, but in the WebElement.findElement case, it won't. that's my point.
2011-06-24T13:30:04  <jarib> so root will never be null :)
2011-06-24T13:30:11  <jarib> ah
2011-06-24T13:30:13  <jarib> nvm :P
2011-06-24T13:30:14  <jimevans> :-P
2011-06-24T13:30:50  <jimevans> i think that's a bug in the IE CSS implementation that didn't get corrected when I refactored some stuff.
2011-06-24T13:31:12  <ncolton> Yay! I can finally breathe long enough to ask the question I got in here hours ago to ask about!
2011-06-24T13:31:30  <jarib> ncolton: shoot!

2011-06-24T13:32:10  <jimevans> oh, wait, never mind. Element does support querySelector. that's what I missed.
2011-06-24T13:32:16  <ncolton> When I'm running Selenium, I get two browser windows; the bottom half is the one navigating the web interface, while the top shows a three pane[l] interface. What is that top thing called? What are the individual panels called?
2011-06-24T13:32:16  <jimevans> nothing to see here, move along.
2011-06-24T13:32:51  <AutomatedTester> ncolton: TestRunner is the top one
2011-06-24T13:33:33  <ncolton> TestRunner? Awesome. Can I output arbitrary information to the left, or bottom panel of it? If so ... where do I look to find out what I can do to interface with them?
2011-06-24T13:33:57  <samitbadle> AutomatedTester: Got delayed.
2011-06-24T13:34:02  <jimevans> adamgoucher: before I started running off at the mouth like an idiot, I was right. we fall back to sizzle in IE only if we don't find querySelector() or querySelectorAll().
2011-06-24T13:34:22  <samitbadle> AutomatedTester: too tired today, will tackle it this weekend.
2011-06-24T13:34:40  <AutomatedTester> samitbadle: sure

2011-06-24T13:37:39  <AutomatedTester> i have never cared about it to be honest
2011-06-24T13:37:47  <AutomatedTester> I just see what py.test outputs to me
2011-06-24T13:38:01  <ncolton> What is py.test ?
2011-06-24T13:38:07  * ncolton puts on the clueless hat.
2011-06-24T13:38:42  <AutomatedTester> its the python test runner I use
2011-06-24T13:39:21  <jarib> adamgoucher: though then we're training people to use extensions like contains(), which isn't supported by browsers
2011-06-24T13:39:34  <ncolton> Ahh. Gotcha. Hrm.
2011-06-24T13:39:53  <jarib> e.g. if a faster CSS library came along without those extensions, should we switch to it?
2011-06-24T13:39:54  <ncolton> Well, thank you anyways. At least I have a word I can usefully search for, now. :)
2011-06-24T13:40:19  <adamgoucher> jarib: which is why i dont expect the argument to go anywhere. though people have been using sizzle specific stuff for awhile now and this is [yet another] pain they need to go through to switch api's
2011-06-24T13:40:22  <jarib> or if all browsers supported querySelector, could we drop the injection
2011-06-24T13:42:36  <jarib> adamgoucher: do you think it would be better if contains() was supported for a while and then dropped?
2011-06-24T13:43:07  *** autojack has left #selenium
2011-06-24T13:44:01  <adamgoucher> i think for the first bit, that the upgrade path from remote control not be intentionally hard. and once [the vast bulk of] people have migrated over, put a big honkin deprecation notice for sizzle specific stuff (even if the library isnt removed) -- and then drop support for sizzle extensions
2011-06-24T13:44:09  <ncolton> AutomatedTester: Is it still going to be called ... oh ... Hey! If I look in the URL of the top browser window I think I just answered part of the question I was going to ask; "RemoteRunner"
2011-06-24T13:44:27  <ncolton> AutomatedTester: I was going to ask if you were answering with the idea that I was using the IDE thing.

2011-06-24T14:54:47  <andytinkham> new2b2: If you're using RC/webdriver, you should have a driver instance that you can pass to the outside function with along with the xpath, perhaps
2011-06-24T14:55:13  <new2b2> where can i find the instance? (i'm using RC)
2011-06-24T14:55:30  <andytinkham> YOu should have already created it when you first launched the driver
2011-06-24T14:55:50  <new2b2> i mean how do I access it so I can pass it to the function
2011-06-24T14:56:06  <andytinkham> What language are you working in?
2011-06-24T14:56:10  <new2b2> python
2011-06-24T14:56:37  <antlong> driver = webdriver.Firefox()
2011-06-24T14:56:54  <andytinkham> OK, that's one I don't know. Basically though, when you create the driver, it returns a value. You need to put that value in a variable that you can access later when you call your function
2011-06-24T14:59:53  <new2b2> hmm, trying to find a way to access it
2011-06-24T15:00:12  <new2b2> antlong: I'm not using webdriver (still too new, don't even get it fully yet)
2011-06-24T15:02:13  <andytinkham> new2b2: In Ruby, I currently pass it along as I initialize the various portions of my implementation model (the piece that has the page objects and all the actual Selenium calls). You could also put it in some central config class that everything can access or even make a global variable if you had to (though something with a little more protection from normal global problems is probably a better option)

2011-06-24T16:02:16  <aivaturi> So with the recent announcement of rapid release schedule of Firefox, I can see some headaches for the Selenium developers

2011-06-24T16:04:28  <jarib> aivaturi: hopefully they are. we have two mozillans as commiters on selenium, i think we should be ok
2011-06-24T16:04:55  <jarib> and i doubt they will break extensions with every release
