2011-06-30T02:22:10  <Ivog> How many chrome drivers can a fast machine run at once? At what point should grid be used?
2011-06-30T02:23:51  <Ivog> If i have an extremely fast server should i install virtual machines which each run a couple of browsers or is it possible (and better) to run all browsers in 1 host?
2011-06-30T02:26:38  <jarib> Ivog: i do the latter. keeps things simple not having to deal with virtual machines
2011-06-30T02:26:51  <jarib> and it's enough for our needs (for now)
2011-06-30T02:29:10  <Ivog> I wonder if it would work for big numbers say 100 browsers
2011-06-30T02:31:14  <jarib> depends on the machine i guess

2011-06-30T04:14:20  <eranm|mac> quick ruby question: Have a look at rake-tasks/crazy_fun/mappings/gcc.rb line 43, for example. out is assigned to out(dir, args) but out is earlier initialized to a File object (as far as I understand). What's the meaning of out(dir,args) when out is a FIle object?
2011-06-30T04:16:50  * jarib looks
2011-06-30T04:18:18  <jarib> huh
2011-06-30T04:19:14  <jarib> File.join just returns a string
2011-06-30T04:19:29  <narvik> Hello. When I run tests with HTMLLauncher I get SeleniumCommandTimedOutException. How can I determine which command causes it? outputFile is empty and getResults() returns null.
2011-06-30T04:19:57  <jarib> eranm|mac: but out(dir,args) shouldn't work in any case. are you sure that code is ever run?
2011-06-30T04:21:04  <eranm|mac> jarib: pretty sure, cpp/build.desc contains multiple calls to gcc_library
2011-06-30T04:21:27  <jarib> eranm|mac: i mean the if branch on line 40
2011-06-30T04:21:39  <jarib> let's see
2011-06-30T04:21:44  <eranm|mac> Ah
2011-06-30T04:22:32  <eranm|mac> Let's see if I understand correctly: this condition will be true if args[:name] is something like xyz and name ends with xyz:xyz
2011-06-30T04:22:33  <eranm|mac> riht?
2011-06-30T04:22:34  <eranm|mac> right?
2011-06-30T04:22:48  <jarib> yes
2011-06-30T04:23:36  <eranm|mac> So no, I don't think we have such a rule

2011-06-30T07:05:03  <RossPatterson> You need a more-specific locator, one that finds it directly.  For example, "//img[@src='my_image_url']"

2011-06-30T07:14:36  <RossPatterson> cheets: I'd suggest you open up the page in Firefox with the Firebug or XPather extensions installed, and let them recommend an XPath for the image.  You may wind up with something more complicated than just "//img...".

2011-06-30T07:43:05  <odix> is there anyway to do if statements in selenium ? example i have a page that i need to click expand on, in 7 differe3nt tables before i start running my tests. now these expand links change per what page it is, can i search for link expand, click, reload page, then search for same thing again ?
2011-06-30T07:45:25  <antlong> if you need to use selenium ide, theres a plugin called flow control, otherwise use a programming language with the corresponding selenium bindings

2011-06-30T08:44:16  <Galaxor> Hi.  So, I have my test site set up where I have http://mysite/test1 and http://mysite/test2.  I recorded some tests while using test1.  The way it recorded, the baseurl was http://mysite/, and it run commands like open /test1/home.  Now my tests are all recorded and I wanted to make it so I could run it on /test2.  So I removed the baseurl from all the files.  I changed all the links in the test case files, so instead of going to /test
2011-06-30T08:44:34  <Galaxor> Also, if I execute open home, it goes to http://mysite/home

2011-06-30T09:55:58  <rmcauley> You'll have to accept some of this as "just the way we do it" though, but here we go:
2011-06-30T09:56:17  <rmcauley> On forms, for styling reasons we use buttons to submit, not <input type="submit"> and these buttons have a name associated to them. ("done")
2011-06-30T09:56:41  <rmcauley> This doesn't appear to get submitted when I do find_element(:name, "sometextfield").submit

2011-06-30T11:01:56  <samitbadle> marlena: Bamboo says that the tests are at  http://hg.mozilla.org/qa/mozmill-automation
2011-06-30T11:01:57  *** dmachi has joined #selenium
2011-06-30T11:02:24  <marlena> ok, so that's why I wasn't seeing them when I searched in the google code project.  I will bookmark that page.
2011-06-30T11:02:29  <samitbadle> so you should not have a problem working with hg
2011-06-30T11:03:16  <samitbadle> adamgoucher: I don't use the developer proxy stuff. I rarely need to debug my own code :-P
2011-06-30T11:03:39  <marlena> (guesses he writes tests instead of debugging)
2011-06-30T11:03:59  <samitbadle> adamgoucher: but, I don't see any reason why it will not work in the proxy. Are you facing any issues?
2011-06-30T11:04:35  <adamgoucher> claims the addon is null; which makes sense since its not actually registered
2011-06-30T11:05:00  <samitbadle> adamgoucher: explain
2011-06-30T11:05:54  <adamgoucher> the proxy is just a pointer in the extensions dir to [say] where svn is. the plugin doesnt get 'installed' via the addon manager
2011-06-30T11:06:45  <adamgoucher> so trying to peer into the manager for options wont work since its not really there
2011-06-30T11:06:46  <samitbadle> marlena: Indeed. If you think a a solution though sufficiently in your head, the rest is really easy.
2011-06-30T11:07:42  <marlena> samitbadle: btw, just remembered davehunt|away's blog posts on running these tests.
2011-06-30T11:09:19  <samitbadle> adamgoucher: hmm, i guess so, if you don't install, then its not there. But you can also install and then point it to where you want. this way everyone is happy.

2011-06-30T11:13:58  <marlena> samitbadle: cool!  I'm just going back through instructions to run tests atm, but would like to try adding one today as well.
2011-06-30T11:14:50  <samitbadle> marlena: excellent!
2011-06-30T11:14:51  <marlena> The syntax of the tests that are in there already looks easy enough.

2011-06-30T11:19:37  <cgp_> Also, the Selenium IDE, do those write tests that are immediately compatible with Selenium 2 -- do I use the WebDriverBackedSelenium to do that?

2011-06-30T11:22:29  <samitbadle> cgp_: Selenium IDE does not support Selenium 2 yet. A limited exporter for selenium 2 should be ready when Selenium 2 is released. It may grow based on what people actually use.

2011-06-30T11:30:00  <samitbadle> marlena: currently they seem to be bundled into the Selenium IDE code itself.
2011-06-30T11:30:24  <samitbadle> marlena: and accessed vis a chrome url. Dave's blog gives some details.
2011-06-30T11:30:29  <marlena> samitbadle: so it looks like I need to get that as wel.
2011-06-30T11:31:00  <samitbadle> to start with you can just put it as a file and access it via a file: url
2011-06-30T11:31:20  <marlena> ok, that works.
2011-06-30T11:32:13  <samitbadle> marlena: not the best way to do it, but great when you are developing the tests.
2011-06-30T11:32:38  <marlena> That will make it easier.
2011-06-30T11:33:14  <RSchulzB> Does the Selenium 2 Grid Hub have a status page like the 1.0 version did?
2011-06-30T11:34:40  <RSchulzB> When I try to access the Hub's Web interface, all I get are 403 pages "Forbidden for Proxy"
2011-06-30T11:36:01  <marlena> samitbadle: Thx for the info.  I made some notes so I can get started later.  This should be enough to get me up and running with it.  I haven't had too many javascript opportunities so this is very exciting for me :)

2011-06-30T11:37:47  *** sjmikem has joined #selenium
2011-06-30T11:40:39  <cgp_> Can selenium 2 run its tests remotely without the use of the grid?
2011-06-30T11:41:24  <jarib> yes
2011-06-30T11:42:43  <cgp_> does it run against the usual selenium server?
2011-06-30T11:43:34  <jarib> yes
2011-06-30T11:45:02  <RSchulzB> Is there a migration guide for 1.0 -> 2.0?
2011-06-30T11:47:22  <cgp_> :(
2011-06-30T11:47:49  <cgp_> Alright, I've been digging around for how to connect the WebDriverBackedSelenium to a selenium server, but can't seem to dig it up
2011-06-30T11:47:54  <cgp_> is there any documentation out there on how to do this
2011-06-30T11:48:00  <cgp_> the closest thing I could find was:
2011-06-30T11:48:01  <cgp_> http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html#remotewebdriver
2011-06-30T11:48:04  <cgp_> and I don't think that's it
2011-06-30T11:48:57  <jarib> what have you tried?
2011-06-30T11:49:10  <jarib> it should be quite straightforward
2011-06-30T11:49:42  <cgp_> jarib: in my search? webdriver selenium server
2011-06-30T11:50:02  <jarib> i meant in code
2011-06-30T11:51:19  <cgp_> ah, well, until I happened upon the incomplete remotewebdriver code, nothing
2011-06-30T11:51:24  <cgp_> looking at the constructor
2011-06-30T11:51:29  <cgp_> (s)
2011-06-30T11:51:32  <cgp_> I'm confused by the choices
2011-06-30T11:51:39  <jarib> that's a good start
2011-06-30T11:51:40  <jarib> ok
2011-06-30T11:51:49  <jarib> do you have the server running locally?
2011-06-30T11:52:20  <cgp_> At the moment no, but I can start it locally
2011-06-30T11:52:21  *** pnitin has joined #selenium
2011-06-30T11:52:27  <cgp_> I run it on another server at the moment
2011-06-30T11:53:03  <jarib> that's fine
2011-06-30T11:53:10  <jarib> so you want the constructor that takes a URL
2011-06-30T11:53:20  <cgp_> bink, it's running locally too
2011-06-30T11:53:45  <cgp_> So I don't need to pass it a commandprocessor or whatever
2011-06-30T11:53:55  <jarib> nope
2011-06-30T11:53:56  <cgp_> I'm not sure if I need to know what that does
2011-06-30T11:54:01  <jarib> you don't
2011-06-30T11:54:02  <cgp_> what's the command processor constructor used for?
2011-06-30T11:54:50  <jarib> if you're implementing your own driver using a different protocol, that can be useful
2011-06-30T11:55:08  <cgp_> ah, interesting
2011-06-30T11:55:26  <jarib> you can supply your own CommandExecutor
2011-06-30T11:55:33  <cgp_> It was kind of nice that the construction of the
2011-06-30T11:55:48  <cgp_> "driver" in selenium 1 was the same whether local or remote
2011-06-30T11:56:23  <jarib> so you want something like this:
2011-06-30T11:56:27  <jarib> WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://localhost:4444/wd/hub"), DesiredCapabilities.firefox());
2011-06-30T11:56:48  <cgp_> Wow, that's not very hard, and to complain about something like that would be, well, rediculous
2011-06-30T11:57:04  <RossPatterson> cgp_: If I follow all this, you've recorded some tests in Selenium IDE, exported them in some programming language using the Selenium RC API, and now you want to run them using the Selenium WebDriver server, correct?
2011-06-30T11:57:31  <cgp_> RossPatterson: I haven't exported them --- they are written in Java, thus, I probably won't be able to export them
2011-06-30T11:57:37  <cgp_> I don't have a ton of tests, so it probably won't matter
2011-06-30T11:57:46  <cgp_> I have the flexibility to move without a huge amount of pain
2011-06-30T11:58:06  <cgp_> I probably have more abstraction surrounding the construciton of the tests than I do tests at the moment
2011-06-30T11:58:42  <cgp_> (taking screenshots on failure, doing some performance metrics on page loads, instantiating the server with defaults when running via a rightclick in eclipse using junit
2011-06-30T11:58:44  <RossPatterson> OK, so you've written some tests in Java using the Selenium RC API, and now you want to run them using the Selenium WebDriver server, correct?
2011-06-30T11:58:53  <cgp_> and then the integration tests on hudson
2011-06-30T11:59:03  <RossPatterson> I have to ask: Why?  What do you get from WebDriverBackedSelenium that you want?
2011-06-30T11:59:15  *** nirvdrum has quit IRC
2011-06-30T11:59:33  <cgp_> Yeah, I'd prefer to not rewrite even the 12 tests I've got at the moment
2011-06-30T11:59:45  <cgp_> If I can use the WebDriverBackedSelenium for the moment
2011-06-30T11:59:54  <cgp_> and add in new tests that use the new functionality, that's great
2011-06-30T12:00:09  <cgp_> maybe I'll even add in annotations that specify what type of test they are
2011-06-30T12:00:15  <RossPatterson> Ah, OK.
2011-06-30T12:01:18  <cgp_> Ok, unrelated question
2011-06-30T12:01:20  <RossPatterson> Sorry to have muddied the waters.
2011-06-30T12:01:27  <cgp_> RossPatterson: not at all
2011-06-30T12:01:28  <cgp_> not at all
2011-06-30T12:02:03  <cgp_> The old version of selenium did some sort of crazy proxy injection thing, what's the new version do -- is there like a little snippet page that describes how the connection is done for each of the browsers?
2011-06-30T12:02:37  <cgp_> Is it some sort of Windows type connectivity? I have no idea what they use anymore. I haven't done windows devleopment in a long, long long long time
2011-06-30T12:03:45  <jarib> you don't need the proxy injection stuff with webdriver
2011-06-30T12:03:58  <cgp_> jarib: right, I was just curious how it connected now
2011-06-30T12:03:59  <RossPatterson> But it's still there for the Selenium RC API.
2011-06-30T12:04:27  <RossPatterson> It's different for each browser, but the differences are hidden from we mere users :-)
2011-06-30T12:04:37  <cgp_> RossPatterson: ah, that's what I was wondering
2011-06-30T12:05:15  <cgp_> I mean, they have drivers for android and stuff
2011-06-30T12:05:17  <cgp_> I found that interesting

2011-06-30T12:07:56  <jarib> the chrome 12 thing is a bug - not a permanent problem
2011-06-30T12:08:03  <jarib> so i wouldn't be too distressed by that :)
2011-06-30T12:08:11  <RossPatterson> cgp_: The Way of The Future is what Opera has done.  They've built, and they take responsibility for, a WebDriver implementation called OperaDriver.  They're moving towards having new versions ready with each new Opera release.
2011-06-30T12:08:22  <cgp_> wow
2011-06-30T12:08:37  <RossPatterson> I believe the Chromium team is either seeing the wisdom of that, or being encouraged to do so.
2011-06-30T12:09:05  <RossPatterson> Yeah, wow.
2011-06-30T12:09:51  <jarib> the chromium team actually has done the same thing :)
2011-06-30T12:10:06  <cgp_> oh, very good
2011-06-30T12:10:06  <jarib> they do maintain the chrome driver.
2011-06-30T12:10:11  <RossPatterson> Then I'm confused - it must be the Mozillians who are being "encouraged" :-)
2011-06-30T12:10:13  <cgp_> very encouraging
2011-06-30T12:10:34  <cgp_> Hah, well, they may have the opinion that their software is open source
2011-06-30T12:10:36  <cgp_> thus, it is fair to write it
2011-06-30T12:10:37  <jarib> RossPatterson: sounds right
2011-06-30T12:10:52  <cgp_> (someone else)
2011-06-30T12:11:13  <cgp_> or, that their opinion is that there isn't "someone else" -- I have no idea clearly
2011-06-30T12:11:19  <cgp_> anyway -- last question
2011-06-30T12:11:45  <cgp_> I've wanted to extract performance information, does selenium2 provide anyway to interface with plugins in say firefox?
2011-06-30T12:12:04  * RossPatterson always gives Opera credit for browser innovation.  It's sometimes wrong, but usually right :-)
2011-06-30T12:12:18  <RossPatterson> Not directly.
2011-06-30T12:12:45  <cgp_> At one point I thought I might be able to do some magic call like "firefox.chrome.extensions.yslow.give_all_performance_information_in_a_string()"
2011-06-30T12:12:57  <cgp_> (in javascript)
2011-06-30T12:13:15  <cgp_> I was hoping to find a page where someone had done something like this, but alas, no luck
2011-06-30T12:13:24  <RossPatterson> Oh, JavaScript.  You can do anything JavaScript will let you do.
2011-06-30T12:13:59  <cgp_> yeah, but I doubt (but do not know) that yslow publishes anything to the "public" javascript space
2011-06-30T12:14:03  <cgp_> whatever that means
2011-06-30T12:14:21  <RossPatterson> Yeah, that would make it hard.
2011-06-30T12:14:36  <RossPatterson> And yeah, "private" is an odd concept in JavaScript.

2011-06-30T13:23:52  <RSchulzB> Does that mean it's not acting as a Grid Hub?

2011-06-30T13:30:52  <algard> RSchulzB, i believe it's just noting that it's not getting it's config from a Grid1 config file
2011-06-30T13:30:55  <algard> shouldn't affect anything
2011-06-30T13:31:09  <RSchulzB> And what should the grid/console look like?
2011-06-30T13:31:23  <RSchulzB> All I see (with one RC running) is "Grid Hub 2.0[rc3]"
2011-06-30T13:31:49  <RSchulzB> I also don't see any of the keep-alive log messages I used to. Is that normal? Or a sign of a problem?
2011-06-30T13:33:19  <algard> i donno about RCs
2011-06-30T13:33:37  <RSchulzB> I'm asking about the console display from the hub server.
2011-06-30T13:33:42  <algard> but it usually shows only "Grid Hub 2.0[rc3]" when no slaves are connected
2011-06-30T13:34:05  <RSchulzB> As I said, I have one RC running.
2011-06-30T13:34:07  <algard> i always see status messages from the slaves if they're connected
2011-06-30T13:34:12  <RSchulzB> -role rc
2011-06-30T13:34:17  <algard> i've never used -role rc

2011-06-30T13:34:47  <RSchulzB> How do you run the remotes with grid?
2011-06-30T13:35:08  <algard> i'm using webdriver
2011-06-30T13:35:09  <algard> not rc
2011-06-30T13:35:10  *** antlong has quit IRC
2011-06-30T13:35:15  <RSchulzB> Are you using Grid?
2011-06-30T13:35:18  <algard> yes
2011-06-30T13:35:50  <RSchulzB> I guess I'm confused by the Grid2 Wiki page.
2011-06-30T13:36:56  <algard> i was too, initially :)
2011-06-30T13:37:00  <RSchulzB> Shouldn't both -role rc and -role webdriver work the same as far as the grid (hub) is concerned?
2011-06-30T13:37:09  <algard> i would think so, yes
2011-06-30T13:37:21  <algard> both should support the -browser arg
2011-06-30T13:38:01  <algard> i'm using -role webdriver -port 5555 -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register -maxConcurrent 5 -browser browserName=firefox,version=5,maxInstances=5,platform=LINUX
2011-06-30T13:38:19  <RSchulzB> Presumably. What I said was, that if you don't give a -role rc (or a -role webdriver) you get a diagnostic from a -browser option.
2011-06-30T13:38:47  <RSchulzB> Do you see any keep-alive messages in the logs (either hub or remote)?
2011-06-30T13:39:05  <RSchulzB> So far, I see only the initial start-up messages in either log file.
2011-06-30T13:44:52  <RSchulzB> Does Selenium 2 (Grid) use the same (or similar) self-healing process as 1.0 did?

2011-06-30T14:14:15  <jarib> ok, i assume you have rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/support/select.rb
2011-06-30T14:14:18  <jarib> do you require that file somewhere?
2011-06-30T14:14:49  <samitbadle> isn't the first two lines doing that?
2011-06-30T14:15:04  <jarib> where?
2011-06-30T14:15:24  <samitbadle> require 'selenium-webdriver'
2011-06-30T14:15:34  <samitbadle> include  Selenium::WebDriver::Support
2011-06-30T14:16:16  <jarib> that requires rb/lib/selenium-webdriver.rb, which again requires rb/lib/selenium/webdriver
2011-06-30T14:16:39  <jarib> you need   require 'selenium/webdriver/support/select'  somewhere
2011-06-30T14:16:51  <jarib> either in rb/lib/selenium/webdriver.rb or in the spec itself
2011-06-30T14:17:18  <jarib> that depends on if we expect people to require the select class when they need it, or we want to automatically require it for them
2011-06-30T14:17:35  <jarib> i think the former makes sense in this case
2011-06-30T14:17:45  <samitbadle> indeed
2011-06-30T14:17:46  <jarib> so you could add the require in the spec
2011-06-30T14:18:48  <samitbadle> ok
2011-06-30T14:19:36  <samitbadle> What does include  Selenium::WebDriver::Support do?
2011-06-30T14:20:07  <samitbadle> ^^ wrong paste
2011-06-30T14:20:14  <samitbadle> What dows "require 'selenium-webdriver'" do?
2011-06-30T14:21:03  <samitbadle> will not require the gem (which has selenium/webdriver/support/select)?
2011-06-30T14:21:13  <jarib> it loads rb/lib/selenium-webdriver.rb
2011-06-30T14:21:33  <jarib> if you look in that file, you'll see it just requires rb/lib/selenium/webdriver.rb
2011-06-30T14:21:49  <jarib> *that* file loads most of the stuff in the gem
2011-06-30T14:22:35  <jarib> especially, it loads rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/common.rb
2011-06-30T14:22:43  *** ian_mac_ has quit IRC
2011-06-30T14:23:06  <jarib> it's not uncommon to have people require optional things themselves, which i think is what we should do for the select class
2011-06-30T14:24:09  <jarib> or we could set up an autoload for the whole Support module
2011-06-30T14:24:18  <jarib> for now though, explicitly requiring in the spec is fine
2011-06-30T14:24:19  <samitbadle> I don't see the rb/lib anywhere under  the spec folder
2011-06-30T14:24:43  <jarib> it's not
2011-06-30T14:24:47  <jarib> it's from the top level
2011-06-30T14:24:48  <samitbadle> I mean no files explicitly does require that starts with rb/lib
2011-06-30T14:24:52  <jarib> there's rb/lib and rb/spec
2011-06-30T14:24:55  <jarib> right
2011-06-30T14:25:11  <jarib> that's because rubygems adds lib/ to ruby's $LOAD_PATH
2011-06-30T14:25:42  <jarib> (more or less)
2011-06-30T14:25:57  <jarib> so you can do requires relative to lib/
2011-06-30T14:26:05  <samitbadle> so is it not enough to just "require 'selenium/webdriver/support/select.rb'" in the spec?
2011-06-30T14:26:17  <jarib> that's enough, yes
2011-06-30T14:26:43  <jarib> (assuming the actual path is rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/support/select.rb)
2011-06-30T14:26:54  <samitbadle> it is
2011-06-30T14:27:00  <jarib> is that not working?
2011-06-30T14:27:17  <samitbadle> I was missing the ".rb"
2011-06-30T14:27:26  <samitbadle> nope.
2011-06-30T14:27:31  <samitbadle> its not :-(
2011-06-30T14:28:19  <jarib> hmm
2011-06-30T14:28:26  <jarib> (it should work without the .rb though)
2011-06-30T14:29:30  <jarib> what's your requires in select_spec.rb?
2011-06-30T14:30:00  <samitbadle> just "require 'selenium/webdriver/support/select.rb'"
2011-06-30T14:30:23  <jarib> try adding this above:
2011-06-30T14:30:23  <jarib> require File.expand_path("../../spec_helper", __FILE__)
2011-06-30T14:31:17  <samitbadle> ok. trying
2011-06-30T14:33:51  <samitbadle> still const_missing
2011-06-30T14:35:02  <jarib> same message? and you kept require 'selenium/webdriver/support/select.rb' below?
2011-06-30T14:35:12  *** admc has joined #selenium
2011-06-30T14:36:02  <jarib> does it fail on the line that requires select.rb or the one that includes Selenium::WebDriver::Support?
2011-06-30T14:36:15  <jarib> if the latter that sounds like select.rb doesn't define the Support module
2011-06-30T14:36:22  <samitbadle> exactly the same. I tried to mispell the select and it seems the file is being loaded.
2011-06-30T14:37:26  <samitbadle> It has module Selenium
2011-06-30T14:37:34  <samitbadle> module WebDriver
2011-06-30T14:37:39  <samitbadle> module Support
2011-06-30T14:37:56  <samitbadle> class Select
2011-06-30T14:38:23  <jarib> that looks right
2011-06-30T14:38:39  <jarib> no misspellings? e.g. Webdriver instead of WebDriver?
2011-06-30T14:39:20  <samitbadle> do I need to require something there?
2011-06-30T14:39:32  <jarib> nope

2011-06-30T20:58:23  <cgp_> anyway, that dependency has a dependency on webdriver-common (of the same vintage)
2011-06-30T20:58:38  <cgp_> but there's a Platform enum as described that can easily get on the path and conflict
2011-06-30T20:58:51  <cgp_> it does not contain the Android value
2011-06-30T20:58:55  <cgp_> and thus, dies

2011-06-30T20:59:15  <cgp_> I was able to weasel out of the issue by excluding the dependency
2011-06-30T20:59:27  <cgp_> (excluding the sub-dependency)
