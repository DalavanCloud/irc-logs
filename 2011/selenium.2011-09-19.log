2011-09-19T05:35:09  <andreastt> Okay, cheers (-:
2011-09-19T05:36:32  <jarib> we could change it to accept several options... e.g. not_compliant_on({:browser => :opera}, {:browser => :chrome, :platform => :macosx})

2011-09-19T08:18:48  <lukeis> it's both ;)
2011-09-19T08:19:03  <lukeis> HtmlUnitDriver implements the WebDriver interface
2011-09-19T08:19:13  <lukeis> (or extends the class)

2011-09-19T09:53:00  <lukeis> ok, so, you are looking for org.apache.xpath.XPathContext right? do you have a dependency to a jar of it somewhere... just search mvnrepository.com and could only find this one: http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/it.svario.xpathapi/xpathapi-jaxp
2011-09-19T09:53:30  <lukeis> you guys could have a local one of XPathAPI in a local nexus or something though...
2011-09-19T09:54:34  <lukeis> I guess we need to troubleshoot what is asking for that class... is this webdriver? or something else (cause I haven't needed that class for webdriver0
2011-09-19T09:54:37  <lukeis> )
2011-09-19T09:55:43  <jimevans> yeah, webdriver needs it. firefox driver specifically. line 121 of FileExtension.java.
2011-09-19T09:55:56  <jimevans> hang on.
2011-09-19T09:58:14  <jimevans> firefox driver is using javax.xml.xpath.XPath. The stack trace is referencing org.apache.xpath.jaxp.XPathExpressionImpl

2011-09-19T11:50:13  <jimevans> i'm having difficulty with the java bindings and maven.
2011-09-19T11:50:30  <lukeis> jimevans: has a very strange error coming... which suggests transient dependencies including something that it shouldn't... but his dependencies are super simple
2011-09-19T11:50:31  <jimevans> for some reason, i can't instantiate the firefox driver.
2011-09-19T11:50:45  <Binken_> Is the hover on works in the Native event.
2011-09-19T11:50:54  <jimevans> "when in doubt, fdisk it out."
2011-09-19T11:51:03  <jimevans> Binken_: maybe.
2011-09-19T11:51:04  <jimevans> :)
2011-09-19T11:51:10  <lukeis> jimevans: next thing to look at is the dependency graph view and try to find something included that is "apache"
2011-09-19T11:51:20  <Binken_> aHa, I have not tried it for long time.
2011-09-19T11:51:39  <jimevans> Binken_: for IE, you still have the same issue that it won't work if your mouse pointer is physically over the browser window.
2011-09-19T11:52:03  <Binken_> Understand
2011-09-19T11:52:11  <dabaR> What is the profile config for disabling https certificate checking?
2011-09-19T11:53:24  <cgoldberg> lord1234, wait... this is VERY odd.. check this out...
2011-09-19T11:53:44  <jimevans> Binken_: for firefox, i think it should work okay (i've not run into problems yet), but it could be broken in some way we haven't yet come across.
2011-09-19T11:54:15  <jimevans> Binken_: chrome doesn't yet support advanced interactions, that I know of.

2011-09-19T12:34:30  <cgoldberg> lord1234, i can't believe my framework tests didn't catch this... it because I never use send_keys() directly... I hav a function built on top of it.. and it always clears the field.. so I never ran into this

2011-09-19T12:36:59  <jimevans> which, since the google search page became all ajax-y, is now a *horrible* canonical exampel.

2011-09-19T13:22:22  <lord1234> luke, no it just creates an index for the .each
2011-09-19T13:23:04  <lukeis> ok, is something else spawning it? that can't be the whole code, can it?
2011-09-19T13:23:37  <lord1234> its that entire function
2011-09-19T13:23:59  <lord1234> the only thing passed into that function is the $browser(the WebDriver Driver element) and the "name"
2011-09-19T13:25:10  <andreastt> lord1234: You could simplify that code by using Array#find.

2011-09-19T15:01:16  <kboers> hey chaps
2011-09-19T15:01:45  <kboers> Has anyone looked at Splinter? http://splinter.cobrateam.info/
2011-09-19T15:02:03  <kboers> And maybe know what Splinter provides that Selenium doesn't?
2011-09-19T15:03:49  <lukeis> splinter looks like it's just python... selenium is in java, c#, python, ruby (and even php / perl, but unofficial)
2011-09-19T15:04:02  <kboers> From a brief look at the github, seems like maybe it adds cookie management and selectors, but I haven't used Sel2 enough to tell the difference
2011-09-19T15:04:17  <kboers> Yeah, also that (only a Python interface)
2011-09-19T15:04:26  <lukeis> also doesn't look like splinter has support for IE... selenium does :)

2011-09-19T15:05:28  <andreastt> No support for Opera either.
2011-09-19T15:05:39  <andreastt> Besides, Selenium has vendor-supported implementations.
2011-09-19T15:05:51  <kboers> right
2011-09-19T15:05:56  <andreastt> There's also an ongoing process in W3C to standardize WebDriver.
2011-09-19T15:06:05  <kboers> Okay, just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything important

2011-09-19T15:35:20  <xp_prg> hi all, I am trying to understand how to create a suite of selenium tests and execute them from the command line and then tell which ones failed
2011-09-19T15:35:43  <xp_prg> I have looked into webdriver, but I am not sure that is the best way as it involved custom programming, is this not a common task etc...
2011-09-19T15:35:43  <xp_prg> ?
2011-09-19T15:37:04  <stephend> xp_prg: what language?
2011-09-19T15:37:16  <stephend> I can give you some pointers, if it's python
2011-09-19T15:37:34  <xp_prg> well php is our main language but I also know python
2011-09-19T15:38:13  <stephend> xp_prg: we use page object model for our test approach, Jenkins for our continuous-integration, and py.test for running tests
2011-09-19T15:38:46  <xp_prg> well, how do you run your selenium tests from the command line and determine from the command line which ones failed?
2011-09-19T15:39:17  <stephend> xp_prg: like so: https://github.com/mozilla/Addon-Tests/blob/master/README.md
2011-09-19T15:39:29  *** santiycr has quit IRC
2011-09-19T15:40:38  <andreastt> xp_prg: If you're using Java, you need some kind of assertion framework.  JUnit is a popular one.
2011-09-19T15:41:00  <xp_prg> stephend what is in py.test?
2011-09-19T15:41:29  <andreastt> Like stephend said, it's common to use some kind of continuous integration service, such as Jenkins, to keep track of any changes or regressions.
2011-09-19T15:41:49  <stephend> xp_prg: we chose it to run our tests -- it allows to do -n x, where "x" is a concurrency number
2011-09-19T15:41:49  <stephend> http://pytest.org/latest/
2011-09-19T15:41:58  <stephend> prior to this, we used nose to run tests
2011-09-19T15:42:07  <stephend> yeah, Jenkins was really the missing piece for coverage/reporting
2011-09-19T15:42:13  <stephend> results.html just wasn't cutting it
2011-09-19T15:42:32  <andreastt> Also, WebDriver has bindings for Ruby.  In which case you probably need to use RSpec, Cucumber or Test::Unit.
2011-09-19T15:43:14  *** jhegge has quit IRC
2011-09-19T15:43:36  <xp_prg> ok, I want to understand something so very, very, very simple, how do I run a suite of tests from the command line only and get which ones failed or passed that use selenium?
2011-09-19T15:43:49  <xp_prg> I am aware of testing frameworks, I am trying to get the actual selenium part understood
2011-09-19T15:44:15  <stephend> xp_prg: we get output, like so
2011-09-19T15:44:15  <andreastt> xp_prg: Selenium doesn't do assertions, so what language + framework are you using?
2011-09-19T15:44:38  <xp_prg> ok, how do I run a selenium test from the command line?
2011-09-19T15:44:44  <xp_prg> lets just start here
2011-09-19T15:44:47  <xp_prg> here = there
2011-09-19T15:45:00  <andreastt> There's no such thing as a Selenium test without JUnit, RSpec, or Test::Unit.
2011-09-19T15:45:07  <andreastt> Selenium is just a library for driving the browser.
2011-09-19T15:45:16  <cgoldberg> +1 ^^
2011-09-19T15:45:38  <stephend> xp_prg: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1333743, but, you want to listen to andreastt :-)
2011-09-19T15:45:40  <xp_prg> yes, but isn't there an api to control the browser?
2011-09-19T15:45:47  <xp_prg> from the commandline?
2011-09-19T15:46:02  <cgoldberg> xp_prg, yes.. but that's all it is.. an API
2011-09-19T15:46:09  <cgoldberg> to drive a browser
2011-09-19T15:46:12  <xp_prg> I guess I need to use the selenium client drivers
2011-09-19T15:46:25  <xp_prg> and then I can search for success or failure etc... ?
2011-09-19T15:46:42  <cgoldberg> xp_prg, you can do whatever you want.. selenium just drives the browser
