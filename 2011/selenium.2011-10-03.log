2011-10-03T00:53:56  <amobile>  //table[@id='formlistTbl']/tbody/tr/td[1][contains(text(),'KAP Applications Review for Panelists')]/parent did not work

2011-10-03T00:55:34  <amobile> itworks :)
2011-10-03T00:55:37  <amobile> thank you
2011-10-03T00:57:05  <amobile> tried also from a while to add /following-sibling to that above darius_w
2011-10-03T00:57:22  <amobile> in fact /following-sibling/a[contains(@href,'generateform/editpage')]
2011-10-03T00:57:38  <amobile> because I have a table with edit and delete for the rows presented
2011-10-03T00:57:54  <amobile> and need to click edit only on the editpage link where that text is
2011-10-03T00:58:40  <amobile>  //table[@id='formlistTbl']/tbody/tr/td[1][contains(text(),'KAP Applications Review for Panelists')]/following-sibling/a[contains(@href,'generateform/editpage')]
2011-10-03T00:59:15  <amobile> or this is not ok darius_w
2011-10-03T01:01:33  <darius_w> well.. edit link is in the other cell then text
2011-10-03T01:01:34  <darius_w> yes?
2011-10-03T01:02:41  <amobile> yes
2011-10-03T01:02:51  <darius_w> so if you are in the cell with text, you go up to the parent (tr in the case) and one tr will have one edit link, yes? so just use // (duoble slash) to find child at eny depth in case /td/a

2011-10-03T02:12:00  <darius_w> well maybe you button get random id... you need to find a way how to find it...
2011-10-03T02:12:32  <darius_w> for example by the image or something like that..
2011-10-03T02:13:05  <ace_me> it seems is always id=cke_29 darius_w
2011-10-03T02:13:06  <Mox[NL]> could also be that there is no page refresh after the click
2011-10-03T02:14:12  <ace_me> no page refresh after click ? should I add that >?
2011-10-03T02:15:17  <ace_me> it looks also there isa need to wait for editor to be initialised
2011-10-03T02:15:37  <Mox[NL]> the "wait" in clickandwait waits for the page to reload, if ajax is used there is no refresh so the "wait" will not trigger

2011-10-03T02:30:07  <jarib> eranm: some of them are complaining about xpcom-config.h as well, i missed that
2011-10-03T02:31:20  <jarib> eranm: what gcc version do you build with? a stack overflow post suggests this is a bug in 4.5
2011-10-03T02:31:40  <barancev> eranm: those tests use Actions. i've added tests for plain click. do you think they are redundant?
2011-10-03T02:31:43  <jarib> (the bits/c++config.h at least)
2011-10-03T02:32:05  <eranm> jarib, the most common reason is that the gecko sdk was not downloaded properly (for missing xpcom-config.h)
2011-10-03T02:32:18  <eranm> I'm compiling with gcc 4.4.3

2011-10-03T02:36:01  <barancev> oups....
2011-10-03T02:36:49  <barancev> then, we have to change dependencies in the project, right?
2011-10-03T02:36:54  <eranm> Some of the sdks still live in the nightly build directories
2011-10-03T02:37:15  <jarib> eranm: perhaps we should just host them ourselves?
2011-10-03T02:38:45  <jarib> eranm: also, these seem like real issues in the NativeEventsFirefoxDriverTestSuite: http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/SE2-JAVA-FX-21/

2011-10-03T02:42:24  <eranm> barancev, clicking on an img should work - sorry, what I meant is that clicking the containing div would not work

2011-10-03T02:44:20  <eranm> barancev, I'm still convinced we somewhere have tests clicking on an img
2011-10-03T02:44:50  <eranm> jarib, as for those failures, that depends on the window manager - sometimes copying and pasting fails with something that's not plain gnome
2011-10-03T02:45:02  <jarib> eranm: ah..
2011-10-03T02:45:24  <eranm> double clicking, that should pass.

2011-10-03T02:46:15  <jarib> eranm: so should the VM, for the native events suite, run a full gnome install?
2011-10-03T02:46:28  <jarib> or can i get away with something smaller
2011-10-03T02:47:13  *** barancev has joined #selenium
2011-10-03T02:47:44  <jarib> perhaps the gnome-core package will do the trick
2011-10-03T02:48:12  <eranm> The only important bit is to have gnome as a session manager and metacity as a window manager
2011-10-03T02:48:24  <eranm> other gnome packages are unimportant

2011-10-03T05:09:38  <eranm> Indeed, you don't need (or want) unity.
2011-10-03T05:12:22  <jarib> apparently unity is the default - i'd like to automate the step of configuring it to use ubuntu classic instead

2011-10-03T05:24:37  <jarib> cgoldberg: i only pulled in gnome-session and metacity
2011-10-03T05:25:10  <jarib> which is what eranm said we need
2011-10-03T05:25:16  <eranm> barancev, think about teams that do all of their work in Javascript. For them, having to use another language just for tests is inconvenient. Since we encourage the model of developers writing their own tests, the JS API is something we want
2011-10-03T05:25:56  <eranm> jarib, it's mostly about focus behaviour: Gnome sends proper focus in / out events as transitions between windows happen
2011-10-03T05:26:14  <jarib> cgoldberg: appears to work well and be relatively light-weight, just looking to get rid of the unity warning
2011-10-03T05:26:28  <eranm> KDE as well, but anything else (i.e. lightweight window managers) either don't send focus events correctly or don't support clipboard properly

2011-10-03T06:30:56  <andreastt> jarib: Odd.  We're getting different results when running OperaDriver against the Selenium test suite internally.

2011-10-03T06:31:36  <andreastt> org.openqa.selenium.ClickTest.testShouldOnlyFollowHrefOnce also fails internally, but not your test run.
2011-10-03T06:32:59  <andreastt> testCanCallGetWindowHandlesAfterClosingAWindow and testCanCloseWindowWhenMultipleWindowsAreOpen were fixed in OperaDriver HEAD I believe, so they can be left as they are.

2011-10-03T07:23:27  <ace_me> it looks I cannot use variables in //td[contains(text(),'custom0804')] so instead that 'custom0804' it does not work with //td[contains(text(),${form_custom})]
2011-10-03T07:23:37  <ace_me> anyone know why ?

2011-10-03T07:28:33  <ace_me> many times you are creating in a web app a new user based on a constant which after save is shown in a table list so at a search will be again shown in the list so it would be usefull to select the td which;s a hrtef contain that constant used in the user creation test

2011-10-03T09:26:14  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> eranm: no, this does not worl
2011-10-03T09:26:15  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> work
2011-10-03T09:26:35  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> I wrote driver.executeScript("fxdriver.Logger.dumpn('hello world');")
2011-10-03T09:27:29  <eranm> I didn't think it would - the logger is supposed to work in the context of the Firefox extension
2011-10-03T09:27:48  <eranm> The way our tests log from inside the page is to append text to an element
2011-10-03T09:28:18  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> eranm: that wont help me a lot, as I am trying to understand the current log statements
2011-10-03T09:28:33  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> and thus would like to mix them with my own so I can understand where is a problem
2011-10-03T09:28:35  <eranm> Elvanor_Thuramdr, what exactly are you trying to do?
2011-10-03T09:28:42  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> eranm: debug a nasty problem
2011-10-03T09:28:58  *** k04n has quit IRC
2011-10-03T09:29:03  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> I am sending a click to Firefox, and it does not happen
2011-10-03T09:29:14  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> sometimes it does, sometimes it does not, to be more precise
2011-10-03T09:29:27  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> In Chrome it always work without problem.
2011-10-03T09:29:35  *** dave_miles_wfh has joined #selenium
2011-10-03T09:29:41  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> Also the tests with native events are very, very slow. Not sure if this is normal
2011-10-03T09:29:47  <eranm> that's different. That hints at a timing problem - if the element that's being clicked on is added dynamically, the test should wait until it's present and visible
2011-10-03T09:29:49  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> but they are at least 3 times slower than with Chrome
2011-10-03T09:30:01  *** davehunt is now known as davehunt|away
2011-10-03T09:30:06  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> eranm: that's what I thought at first, but I am already waiting for the element
2011-10-03T09:30:13  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> so I think everythin is OK
2011-10-03T09:30:21  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> actually what I have now is a loop with 5 clicks on the element
2011-10-03T09:30:31  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> the first one failes most of the time - all others go OK
2011-10-03T09:30:41  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> so I dont think it is a timing problem.
2011-10-03T09:30:58  <jarib> eranm: hmm, did we ever look into the native events perf regression someone reported on twitter, i wonder
2011-10-03T09:31:10  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> (Although If I sleep for 1000ms before the click, it always work)
2011-10-03T09:31:12  *** stackedsax has quit IRC
2011-10-03T09:31:26  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> so it may be some sort of timing problem but I think the problem lies with WebDriver
2011-10-03T09:31:33  <eranm> Elvanor_Thuramdr, so there's something with the set-up of the page: perhaps the event handler is not attached in time
2011-10-03T09:31:48  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> eranm: maybe, but this is not the first click I do on the page
2011-10-03T09:32:00  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> There is a login window first, then after login I click
2011-10-03T09:32:07  <eranm> Elvanor_Thuramdr, we had a problem with similar symptoms in a complex GWT application.
2011-10-03T09:32:30  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> eranm: my app is extremely complex. and a bit the same architecture as GWT
2011-10-03T09:32:31  <eranm> Turned out they had hard-coded sleep of 200ms before doing anything, WebDriver always completed the native input before that time
2011-10-03T09:32:39  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> It's just Qooxdoo and not GWT.
2011-10-03T09:33:02  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> eranm: argh. nasty.
2011-10-03T09:33:14  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> But I dont think this is the case here as it always work with Chrome
2011-10-03T09:33:21  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> and Chrome process the events much faster
2011-10-03T09:33:35  <eranm> Chrome also executes Javascript faster
2011-10-03T09:33:52  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> yeah, so I dont think it's a problem coming from the JS library
2011-10-03T09:34:01  <eranm> jarib, I haven't looked into performance issues with native events recently
2011-10-03T09:34:08  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> it's slow on FF :)
2011-10-03T09:34:14  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> however I dont really care
2011-10-03T09:34:27  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> what's important for me is that it is currently very buggy :(
2011-10-03T09:34:48  <eranm> Elvanor_Thuramdr, especially if native events are turned on, clicks will be sent - the only difference could be the coordinates
2011-10-03T09:34:53  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> eranm: So I cannot log to the FF console
2011-10-03T09:35:07  <eranm> What you could do is build WebDriver from trunk and add instrumentation to tell you to which coordinates click is being sent to
2011-10-03T09:35:08  <jarib> eranm: i'll see if i can find the tweet with the numbers, though i guess you would've known if there was a serious regression by looking at internal builds
2011-10-03T09:35:14  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> eranm: I checked the coordinates with: println logoutButton.getCoordinates().getLocationOnScreen().getX()
2011-10-03T09:35:16  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> and they are OK
2011-10-03T09:35:38  *** sfbrian has joined #selenium
2011-10-03T09:35:46  <eranm> Elvanor_Thuramdr, see which coordinates *WebDriver* sends the click to, and if they match
2011-10-03T09:36:05  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> I can add a global mouseClick on the body
2011-10-03T09:36:08  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> on my app
2011-10-03T09:36:16  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> this will be faster than building WD from trunk
2011-10-03T09:36:20  <eranm> you could do that.
2011-10-03T09:37:29  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> eranm: [INFO] nsCommandProcessor.js:233 Ignoring pending about:document-onload-blocker request

2011-10-03T09:41:42  <Elvanor_Thuramdr> eranm: reading now but not sure I understand everything

2011-10-03T09:42:20  <jarib> oh wait
2011-10-03T09:42:25  <jarib> wrong gist, that's with native events turned off
2011-10-03T09:42:43  <jarib> there's the problem: https://gist.github.com/1218960
2011-10-03T09:43:32  <eranm> Elvanor_Thuramdr, bottom line is, it's very unlikely that a click event is sent to the wrong window handle, it may be that it's sent to the wrong coordinates, but if you'll see that the click is sent to the right coordinates on executions where click doesn't register on your app, as well as executions where it does, then it's not the click implementation at fault.
2011-10-03T09:44:08  <eranm> jarib, any idea which platform?

2011-10-03T11:14:42  <freynaud> jimevans: it creates a page, with create = proxy all the WebElement variable from the @FindBy annotation
2011-10-03T11:15:20  <jimevans> freynaud: yeah, but if I'm reading the code properly, your page object class has to have a constructor that takes a WebDriver instance. true or not?
2011-10-03T11:15:29  <jimevans> if true, can that constructor be private?
2011-10-03T11:16:06  <jimevans> (my source code is in a state where I can't quickly test the scenario)
2011-10-03T11:16:36  <freynaud> jimevans: it doesn't do a lot of work, the key part is in the init element methods. You can use that directly wihout using the PageFactory directly

2011-10-03T15:39:39  <AutomatedTester> do you want it this week?
2011-10-03T15:39:45  <simonstewart> Yup
2011-10-03T15:40:03  <simonstewart> We've had 2.7 out for more than a week
2011-10-03T15:40:08  <simonstewart> So the sooner, the better
2011-10-03T15:40:15  <AutomatedTester> i am probably going to be up to my eye balls in admin :/

2011-10-03T15:40:37  <simonstewart> Are we ready for Firefox 8 and 9?
2011-10-03T15:40:45  <AutomatedTester> havent checked
2011-10-03T15:40:50  <AutomatedTester> I can help out with that
2011-10-03T15:40:54  <AutomatedTester> 8 for Se1
2011-10-03T15:41:35  <simonstewart> 8 and 9 for WebDriver is probably more pressing
2011-10-03T15:41:51  <AutomatedTester> yea, I can have a look at that tomorrow
2011-10-03T15:42:03  <AutomatedTester> I suspect 8 is broken :(

2011-10-03T22:25:21  <ace_me> hi! I've started Selenium RC and I tried to run a test but I get PHPUnit_Framework_Exception: Could not connect to the Selenium RC server.
2011-10-03T22:27:35  <darius__w> ace_me: well, looks like error says everything... test usual things, is server running, are host and port provided a correct and isnt it blocked by firewal and so on..
2011-10-03T22:28:07  <ace_me> darius__w I agrree ! the server RC was stated in a cmd window so I see is running
2011-10-03T22:29:24  <ace_me> was started on port 4444 and is local
2011-10-03T22:29:42  <ace_me> so firewall will not allow connection from outside
2011-10-03T22:29:45  <ace_me> on port 4444
2011-10-03T22:30:04  <ace_me> is this testing needed connections from outsside on 4444 darius__w?
2011-10-03T22:30:30  <darius__w> thats depends on what machine your test is running..
2011-10-03T22:31:55  <ace_me> dropped firewall for a test and effect was the same
2011-10-03T22:32:03  <ace_me> stopped* better saying
2011-10-03T22:32:35  <darius__w> if its local, try 127.0.0.1 insted of localhost
2011-10-03T22:32:37  <ace_me> test is running on my machine darius__w and i plan to test outside servers like www.google.com let's say
2011-10-03T22:33:00  <ace_me> where to try 127.0.0.1 ?
2011-10-03T22:33:07  <ace_me> instead of localhost
2011-10-03T22:33:35  <darius__w> well your test script connects to RC server, so you need to provide it host and port to connect
2011-10-03T22:33:50  <ace_me>       array(          'name'    => 'Firefox on Linux',          'browser' => '*firefox /usr/lib/firefox/firefox-bin',          'host'    => 'my.linux.box',          'port'    => 4445,          'timeout' => 30000,      ),
2011-10-03T22:34:08  <darius__w> use ip for host
2011-10-03T22:34:25  *** jeichar has joined #selenium
2011-10-03T22:34:50  <darius__w> and i remember you say server listens on port 4444 and not 4445 as in your config
2011-10-03T22:35:47  <ace_me> yes I was trying yesterday on 4445
2011-10-03T22:35:55  <ace_me> as 4444 was reported as used
2011-10-03T22:36:04  <ace_me> I will checkc back
2011-10-03T22:36:18  <ace_me> now replaced host 127.0.0.1 and tooks longer
2011-10-03T22:36:32  <ace_me> i only see an E in the cmd prompt
2011-10-03T22:36:39  <ace_me> EE
2011-10-03T22:36:53  <ace_me> I assume I will get better results
2011-10-03T22:37:08  <ace_me> starting to understand what is happening and how to use it I think
