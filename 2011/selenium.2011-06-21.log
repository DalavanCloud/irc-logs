2011-06-21T01:30:12  <vaidab> when testing my webapp manually and i get a confirm box (http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1342388/syneto/good_conf_box_1.png), the browser renders it with an overlay, but when run with remotewebdriver the overlay is not present and the confirm is in a window (http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1342388/syneto/bad_conf_box_1.png), any idea why is this happening?
2011-06-21T01:30:41  <vaidab> same browser, firefox 4
2011-06-21T01:31:03  <vaidab> just the added user.js that is sent from remotewebdriver

2011-06-21T01:42:12  <vaidab> that is how firefox4 renders it
2011-06-21T01:43:57  <vaidab> just a plain confirm('message')
2011-06-21T01:44:27  <Binken> I don't know is this actually alert
2011-06-21T01:45:57  <vaidab> it is a confirm
2011-06-21T01:46:00  <vaidab> not an alert
2011-06-21T01:46:21  <vaidab> alert only has OK, confirm has OK and CANCEL
2011-06-21T01:46:41  <Binken> So it's not a div layer?
2011-06-21T01:46:54  <vaidab> no
2011-06-21T01:47:13  <vaidab> don;t you have firefox?
2011-06-21T01:47:17  <Binken> YES
2011-06-21T01:47:29  <vaidab> and if you put there a confirm(), check it out

2011-06-21T02:13:10  <vaidab> and can not acctept them?
2011-06-21T02:13:16  <vaidab> the tests stop
2011-06-21T02:13:32  <AutomatedTester> you're hitting a race condition in your JS?

2011-06-21T02:14:12  <vaidab> there is not race condition
2011-06-21T02:14:46  <vaidab> ok, but this happens only when working with remotewebdriver

2011-06-21T06:32:42  <Ivog> The answer is refactor :)
2011-06-21T06:32:59  <L4nce0> I need to make it so exicution is not 4 hours.. it's navigating to 5*2 base webpages, and then going to 400*3 webpages, and starting a dowload of a small file.
2011-06-21T06:33:19  <ato> Parallellize?
2011-06-21T06:33:24  <davehunt> freynaud: So Selenium 2.0 running with -role rc should send heartbeats? I'm not seeing that
2011-06-21T06:33:50  <L4nce0> ..not really sure how that helps with bandwidth
2011-06-21T06:33:54  <jimevans> Ivog: is this the Java bindings, or another language?
2011-06-21T06:34:08  <Ivog> C#
2011-06-21T06:34:33  <jimevans> I'm pretty sure I was on the latest when I built and released the .NET bindings.
2011-06-21T06:34:37  <Ivog> Doesnt work with latest version also
2011-06-21T06:34:46  <jimevans> then it doesn't matter.
2011-06-21T06:34:47  <freynaud> davehunt:  reading the code
2011-06-21T06:35:01  <L4nce0> I've disabled all the image downloading, but I'm not really sure what else I can do to speed it up
2011-06-21T06:35:15  <freynaud> davehunt: i may have been a bit optimistic
2011-06-21T06:35:23  <__mike> L4nce0 stick it on a grid
2011-06-21T06:35:27  <jimevans> Ivog: do you know if you have the same problem in Java (or ruby or python)? I need to know if the problem is language-specific, or if it's in the code common to all languages.
2011-06-21T06:35:31  <__mike> and then parallelise the tests with a thread pool
2011-06-21T06:35:35  <freynaud> the hub understands heartbeat, but the new nodes don't send them
2011-06-21T06:35:45  <davehunt> freynaud: I saw that Grid 2.0 supports the heartbeat request, but couldn't see where it sends them
2011-06-21T06:35:48  <L4nce0> __mike, a grid? yes I am connected to the cities power grid ;)
2011-06-21T06:35:58  <__mike> lol
2011-06-21T06:36:17  <__mike> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2
2011-06-21T06:36:19  <L4nce0> it's not actually a test, it's a web scrapper that makes an excel file with 30k entries..
2011-06-21T06:36:23  <Ivog> Im not sure
2011-06-21T06:36:29  <davehunt> freynaud: could we add that in? at the moment if we restart the hub then we also have to restart all nodes :/
2011-06-21T06:36:38  <__mike> docs are there L4nce0
2011-06-21T06:36:50  <__mike> which reminds me i want to write some tonight..
2011-06-21T06:37:06  <L4nce0> cool I'll check it out.
2011-06-21T06:37:07  <freynaud> davehunt: sure. I don't see that problem as the hub is registering the node for me:)
2011-06-21T06:37:21  <Ivog> One minute jim let me find out
2011-06-21T06:37:53  <__mike> L4nce0: grid allows you to run nodes on many different machines and have the tests executing there. if you only have one machine there isn't that much point in using a grid. you would be better off just parallelising your tests with a thread pool or something
2011-06-21T06:37:58  <Ivog> Ok so the java tests work, c# dont work
2011-06-21T06:37:58  <davehunt> freynaud: the hub registers the node?
2011-06-21T06:38:33  <jimevans> ok. that's a problem in C# then. give me a minute to update this environment to latest sources.
2011-06-21T06:39:05  <jimevans> is there a specific test case that shows the problem?
2011-06-21T06:39:05  <freynaud> davehunt:  yes. My node usually do not exist yet when i start the hub. The hub starts, and using a beforeReistration hook, it powers on the VM, start webdriver and all the stuff I'm too lazy to do myslft
2011-06-21T06:39:48  <Ivog> There's 7 dotnet tests failing on my machine concerning elementselecting
2011-06-21T06:40:15  <Ivog> And 3 draganddrop tests

2011-06-21T06:40:40  <rpk> morning
2011-06-21T06:41:28  <__mike> L4nce0 you would probably get the biggest speedup from parallelising if you're not doing so already
2011-06-21T06:43:00  <L4nce0> I still don't see how that would help. I make a list of links I need to visit and click the download button on. In the end I/O is the problem, not my CPU
2011-06-21T06:44:02  <L4nce0> (not intending to sound rude, its 8 am and haven't gone to bed yet =) )
2011-06-21T06:44:09  <__mike> say you split the list into 2. you could have 2 different browsers working on each half of the list at the same time. does that sound like something that would make it faster ?
2011-06-21T06:44:52  <L4nce0> well, isn't that like taking a bottleneck, and cutting the hole in two?
2011-06-21T06:45:15  <rpk> no, you can execute multiple requests at a time on your webserver
2011-06-21T06:45:37  <__mike> the 2 different webdrivers can be executed concurrently
2011-06-21T06:45:40  <__mike> and perform independently
2011-06-21T06:45:40  <L4nce0> ah I see, interesting..

2011-06-21T06:46:23  <L4nce0> I didn't think that THEIR servers responce time might be the real bottleneck. I mean a 12 mb connection and tiny excel files..
2011-06-21T06:46:29  <__mike> firefox is definitely okay. not sure about chrome. i think that's okay too
2011-06-21T06:46:50  <__mike> you mean the bottleneck is your download speed ?
2011-06-21T06:46:58  <rpk> you need to  confirm that the correct file is being sent?
2011-06-21T06:46:59  <L4nce0> I'm using custom profiles, is that going to be an issue? I have to because the way this site handles logons
2011-06-21T06:47:05  <rpk> why not just look at the request?
2011-06-21T06:47:12  <rpk> (response to the request)
2011-06-21T06:47:20  <rpk> and no, just load identical custom profiles
2011-06-21T06:47:30  <L4nce0> they are all called the same, firefox just downloads it and appends a number
2011-06-21T06:48:06  <rpk> is there another way you can validate the download, without actually downloading?
2011-06-21T06:48:07  <Ivog> Just use 1 profile for all ff instances
2011-06-21T06:48:17  <rpk> perhaps checking what url the download request is sent to?
2011-06-21T06:48:19  <L4nce0> I will try this, thank you for the help. After I sleep I will return and ask why I am getting random empty firefox windows lo

2011-06-21T07:37:57  <Ivog> That xp machine is x86 i assume can a windows7 64 machine be added as well?
2011-06-21T07:38:23  <jimevans> the biggest problem would be making sure you're building in a VS environment from the command line. The "go" build script works a treat for .NET, including tests.

2011-06-21T07:40:23  <Ivog> Can xserve handle 64bit?
2011-06-21T07:40:38  <adamgoucher> the machine right now is pretty maxed out
2011-06-21T07:41:14  <adamgoucher> we have on out (long) list of to-do's to fix the build environment(s)
2011-06-21T07:42:05  <Ivog> Ok, because win764 is an env giving problems, not sure if xp x86 has those same problems
2011-06-21T07:42:20  <jimevans> Ivog: In all of the issues I've encountered while working on the project, I've yet to run into a 32-bit vs. 64-bit Windows issue. I've seen problems among different version of browsers, but not 32- vs. 64-bit
2011-06-21T07:43:02  <jimevans> the problems you're currently seeing in the .NET firefox tests are test-related, not bugs in the project code.

I'm using a basic test ( http://pastebin.com/aVUKM1Gv ).  using browser '*iexplore' results in a script error in htmlutils.js, so on the recommendation of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517623/internet-explorer-8-64bit-and-selenium-not-working I switched to iexploreproxy.  now it goes to www.example.com...

2011-06-21T10:35:35  <hiredgun79> ok, so the RC is just pinging connection to hubâ€¦ and not getting any sort of error message, but wondering if it somehow loses connection and that's why it's not continuing with the tests

2011-06-21T10:51:07  <jarib> dhackner: you're probably confusing CSS and Sizzle
2011-06-21T10:51:15  <dhackner> how can I work around queries like "div#foo a:contains('bar')"
2011-06-21T10:51:25  <dhackner> jarib: perhaps. can you elaborate?
2011-06-21T10:51:37  <jarib> contains() isn't part of the CSS spec
2011-06-21T10:51:43  <dhackner> css3
2011-06-21T10:51:45  <jarib> no
2011-06-21T10:51:48  <dhackner> no?
2011-06-21T10:51:51  <jarib> no.
2011-06-21T10:51:53  <AutomatedTester> dhackner: it was dropped from CSS3
2011-06-21T10:51:58  <dhackner> hmmm
2011-06-21T10:52:27  <dhackner> is sizzle like css or jquery where its another js selector library?
2011-06-21T10:52:28  <jarib> it works in SE1 since it's using Sizzle to provide CSS support
2011-06-21T10:52:49  <AutomatedTester> dhackner: Sizzle is CSS plus extras
2011-06-21T10:52:50  <jarib> Sizzle provides contains() as an extension
2011-06-21T10:52:53  <dhackner> gotcha
2011-06-21T10:52:55  <dhackner> hmm
2011-06-21T10:52:58  <dhackner> so
2011-06-21T10:53:07  <dhackner> i had sizzle and jquery (which I added as an extension)
2011-06-21T10:53:13  <jarib> webdriver will use the browser's native CSS implementation
2011-06-21T10:53:23  <dhackner> how can I write what I wrote above in webdriver code for java?
2011-06-21T10:53:29  <dhackner> "div#foo a:contains('bar')"
2011-06-21T10:53:49  <jarib> easiest is to use an xpath
2011-06-21T10:54:08  <dhackner> i was under the impression we were moving away from xpath when possible?
2011-06-21T10:54:13  <dhackner> at least w/SE1
2011-06-21T10:55:00  <jarib> there are tradeoffs
2011-06-21T10:55:10  <dhackner> speed
2011-06-21T10:55:10  <jarib> XPath is slow in IE which doesn't have a native XPath implementation
2011-06-21T10:55:33  <dhackner> so what is the ideal way to do that locator for IE? still xpath?
2011-06-21T10:56:21  <jarib> either that or iterate through the anchors in java
2011-06-21T10:57:08  <dhackner> hmm
2011-06-21T10:57:30  <dhackner> guess I'll need to write some webdriver extensions to do that
2011-06-21T10:57:49  <dhackner> since java won't let me write a clean little .foreach() kinda thing like groovy or ruby
