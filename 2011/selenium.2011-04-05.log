2011-04-05T06:47:32  <antlong> its pretty inefficient

2011-04-05T09:22:16  <antlong> swheatley you probably just want to set an implicit_wait
2011-04-05T09:22:28  <antlong> swheatley, are you using my selenium bindings btw?

2011-04-05T09:23:32  <swheatley> is that a hold-over from Selenium 1--ah ok
2011-04-05T09:23:42  <simonstewart> implicit waits are new in se2
2011-04-05T09:24:18  <antlong> swheatley driver.implicitly_wait(60)
2011-04-05T09:24:40  <swheatley> antlong, ah ok. so there's no more waiting for a frame to load explicitly in S2?
2011-04-05T09:24:41  <True_Blue> With pageObjects, you should return a Page Object with some methods.  How do you handle .back()?  Shouldnt there be custom ones on each PageObject returning the Page Object you are going to with back()?
2011-04-05T09:24:48  <antlong> swheatley, its implicit
2011-04-05T09:25:01  <antlong> True_Blue, no that page would be stale
2011-04-05T09:25:12  <swheatley> antlong so it will wait for 60 seconds or until everything finishes loading?
2011-04-05T09:25:29  <antlong> swheatley, until the command is successful, or the timeout limit is reached
2011-04-05T09:25:35  <swheatley> antlong, at least in your driver.implicitly_wait(60) example
2011-04-05T09:25:41  <swheatley> antlong, great, thanks

2011-04-05T09:26:31  <antlong> no, im way too last minute
2011-04-05T09:26:39  <True_Blue> So you would have a custom back(), that would call driver.manage().back() and then return a new Pagefactory with the PageObject you are now going back to

2011-04-05T09:37:15  <antlong> swheatley, theres not much context there
2011-04-05T09:37:30  <antlong> swheatley, what is actually being ran, and what is the result?
2011-04-05T09:37:43  <True_Blue> antlog: I'm not sure how to shorten it.  I could create a method called "arriveHere" that would do all of that to get you to the Page
2011-04-05T09:38:02  <swheatley> the login works, and redirects, but it attempts to find the frame immediately without waiting (or so it seems)
2011-04-05T09:38:28  <swheatley> I've tried the implicit wait at the end of the login() function as well, but I see the same results
2011-04-05T09:38:32  <antlong> swheatley, whats the exception
2011-04-05T09:38:40  <swheatley> I get a NoSuchFrameException before the page finishes loading
2011-04-05T09:38:53  <antlong> simonstewart, have you noticed that switch_to_frame is instantaneous?
2011-04-05T09:39:00  <simonstewart> it should be
2011-04-05T09:39:06  <simonstewart> It just says "future commands go here"
2011-04-05T09:39:09  <simonstewart> (break time)
2011-04-05T09:39:37  <antlong> swheatley you need to do a try/except

2011-04-05T09:46:10  <antlong> True_Blue, a method called navigateTo that takes args would be the better way to implement it

2011-04-05T09:47:26  *** balooo has joined #selenium
2011-04-05T09:47:57  <antlong> True_Blue, then you should have a method that is generic enough to take those directions, or a method grouped in to the corresponding class
2011-04-05T09:49:16  <True_Blue> I have all of my Page Objects extending a DefaultPage.  I could put in the DefaultPage, a bunch of navigateTo methods that would go to each page
2011-04-05T09:49:24  <True_Blue> so navigateToSearch
2011-04-05T09:49:25  <True_Blue> etc
2011-04-05T09:49:37  <antlong> navigateTo(Search)

2011-04-05T09:55:14  <xirkus> True_Blue: unfortunately, our application does not have a hierarchical page layout so I could not create a page hierarchy; I have to rely on elements on a page to navigate to other pages.

2011-04-05T09:57:44  <True_Blue> Did you use an Interface to do that?  I had created a generic interface, that all of my Page Objects could be put into.  But then they can only access the methods in the interface
2011-04-05T09:57:47  <True_Blue> Not their own
2011-04-05T09:59:01  <swheatley> antlong: so an explicit time.sleep(10) works, although typically the load time is much less. Not ideal, but it works. Thanks!
2011-04-05T09:59:16  <xirkus> I used an abstract template to generate all of my pages, but the navigation methods exist on my element objects as they are how I link navigation between pages. The gotoLink is part of the element interface.
2011-04-05T09:59:39  <swheatley> so the implicitly_wait/switch_to_frame functionality is behaving as expected? There's no way to let Se2 know to wait for a particular frame to finish loading?
2011-04-05T09:59:43  <antlong> swheatley, yeah thats essentially what it would be doing anyway, if it had implicitly waited for the frame
2011-04-05T10:00:14  <antlong> swheatley according to the boss it is indeed working as intended for now
2011-04-05T10:00:31  <swheatley> antlong: right, but it looks like in Se1, it would have started immediately after the frame finished loading, not finish out the wait time
2011-04-05T10:00:49  <swheatley> antlong: I definitely understand that  :)
2011-04-05T10:02:08  <swheatley> antlong: thanks again for your help. If I get some time, I'll see if I can hack something together to provide that functionality for waiting on frames in the new Se2 framework
2011-04-05T10:02:16  <swheatley> and I'll keep my eye on the roadmap

2011-04-05T10:05:00  <True_Blue> Looking at seeing what I can do now
2011-04-05T10:07:27  <xirkus> True_Blue: np. Keep in mind that I use the concept of page elements in my tests. I encapsulated certain UI elements in objects so that I can specify them dynamically (i.e. I can find a Button with the "OK" label). YMMV.
2011-04-05T10:09:24  <True_Blue> true
2011-04-05T10:09:47  <True_Blue> I'm trying to slim down what I see within my tests
2011-04-05T10:10:09  <True_Blue> And its proving a little more challenging, mainly from my incompetence
2011-04-05T10:10:23  <True_Blue> So I've been looking at different examples
2011-04-05T10:12:22  <True_Blue> I had originally written: ModulePage page = new ModulePage.getHere();
2011-04-05T10:12:35  <True_Blue> So that the way to get to that page, is housed within thate Page Object
2011-04-05T10:14:09  <xirkus> that can work if you have the ability to nest page objects; then you can traverse it's inheritance hierarchy to determine the location starting from the top-most parent. I did it this way against an application that was structured hierarchically; doesn't work with process type page flows however.
2011-04-05T10:14:55  *** pnitin has joined #selenium

I had a variable named sAvg, changed the name to nAvg, but i'm still getting errors saying that sAvg doesn't exist.  There are no calls to sAvg anywhere in the codebase.
2011-04-05T13:21:37  <antlong> lord1234, debug your test.

2011-04-05T15:01:42  <plantian> Hi, I'm having trouble getting the "big picture" with selenium.   Does my site need to be running in order to use the web driver or can I pass raw pages to selenium? (Ie. in place of the "#get page" seen here http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium)
2011-04-05T15:03:17  <selbot2> jmleyba half a minute ago - JasonLeyba: Updating the Java bindings to work with the new ChromeDriver. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11884

2011-04-05T15:13:33  <antlong> plantian, file:// is the prefix for a local file on your computer.

2011-04-05T15:53:27  <plantian> jarib: Okay, thanks, I think it might be overkill for me.  There are some heavy JS elements but I will just test the inputs/outputs and not the interaction for now.
2011-04-05T15:53:58  <jarib> sure, if you don't think you'll need it
2011-04-05T15:54:14  <jarib> but if you think you will eventually, it's a good idea to get this infrastructure running as early as possible

2011-04-05T15:54:59  <antlong> its more work not to run a web server in all seriousness

2011-04-05T15:58:29  <plantian> Well the work is already done to access the urls directly without running a server in a fixture.  So I have to create a fixture that starts the server and then runs the tests against it in a way that the tests don't clobber each other.
2011-04-05T15:59:14  <antlong> plantian, huh?
2011-04-05T15:59:33  <antlong> plantian, can you describe the setup for such a thing. i think we might be on different pages.
2011-04-05T16:03:02  <plantian> antlong:  It looks something like this -- http://paste.pocoo.org/show/366230/
2011-04-05T16:04:03  <antlong> ok, why wouldnt you leave the server running?
2011-04-05T16:04:45  <antlong> also, are you new to python?
2011-04-05T16:04:47  <antlong> brb
2011-04-05T16:12:37  <plantian> antlong: Yeah good point, too much programming not enough thinking over here.  I could just start it before, not very automated but its okay.  I can just load a fresh test db or something before starting it.  And no I'm not new.
2011-04-05T16:14:33  <antlong> plantian, so what i would do, is not use unittest, check out pytest, and keep the server running in the background. dont worry about tests clobbering each other, by design these frameworks should be able to operate in unison without any issues

2011-04-05T16:18:21  <plantian> antlong: All unit test helpers seem the same to me, why would I choose pytest it looks just like unittest?
2011-04-05T16:19:06  <antlong> the bullet points here, http://pytest.org/ say more than i could explain

2011-04-05T16:43:06  <plantian> antlong:  I fixed it, looks like LOGGER statements needed to be commented out.

2011-04-05T16:50:11  <plantian> There actually really is a bracket on the end.
2011-04-05T16:50:42  <antlong> theres no @class or @id ?
2011-04-05T16:58:53  <plantian> antlong: Actually my mistake, it was a relative url and not an absolute url.  It passes now, my first successful selenium test.
2011-04-05T16:59:41  <antlong> no prob, try not use properties though, xpath is real brittle

2011-04-05T21:09:06  <nirvdrum> I saw the tweet.
2011-04-05T21:09:46  <adamgoucher> whats the point of thinking you have influence without abusing it
2011-04-05T21:10:28  <nirvdrum> Absolutely.
2011-04-05T21:10:40  <nirvdrum> And it just finally occurred to me that there's an ice machine down the hall.
2011-04-05T21:10:46  <nirvdrum> So, finally icing my knee.
2011-04-05T21:11:33  <nirvdrum> Btw, that deploy / provisioning plugin I was telling you about: https://github.com/wr0ngway/rubber
2011-04-05T21:12:44  <adamgoucher> thinking i should do the whole naming/what-do-we-call-what thing as a lightning talk
2011-04-05T21:14:01  <nirvdrum> Just don't do it with Simon around.
2011-04-05T21:15:04  <adamgoucher> nah. i dont think its too confrontational.
2011-04-05T21:15:19  <adamgoucher> actually, ya, cus i say its not an upgrade but a conversion :)
2011-04-05T21:16:11  <adamgoucher> but i did say not to use grid while standing next to you and survived...
2011-04-05T21:16:28  <nirvdrum> Heh.
2011-04-05T21:16:42  <nirvdrum> I think you're wrong, but it stems from ignorance.
2011-04-05T21:16:48  <nirvdrum> Not malice.
2011-04-05T21:17:20  <nirvdrum> The problem with relying on just CI server is you have no means to queue up tests if you have more tests than you do resources.
2011-04-05T21:17:32  <nirvdrum> Or you do it very tersely by limiting # of build agents.
2011-04-05T21:17:53  <nirvdrum> The hub can intelligently route and queue requests in a way that a CI server will never be able to.
2011-04-05T21:18:15  <adamgoucher> i think too it is about the goal the grid/parallel stuff is trying to achieve
2011-04-05T21:19:25  <nirvdrum> oh, and then there's the whole versioning component.
2011-04-05T21:19:29  <nirvdrum> *aspect
2011-04-05T21:19:44  <nirvdrum> So, I want to run in different versions of IE, not just plain *iexplore.
2011-04-05T21:21:30  <adamgoucher> sure. remote ci agents all have some way of indicating their capabilities. the job then is configured to go to the agent with the capabilitiy
