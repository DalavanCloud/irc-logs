2011-03-09T05:54:15  <jqp> is there a simple way to launch multiple browsers instances that don't share session cookies in selenium rc?
2011-03-09T05:55:12  <RossPatterson> Which browser?
2011-03-09T05:55:26  <jqp> firefox
2011-03-09T05:56:06  <jqp> ideally i would like to not have to create n new profiles to be able to launch n browser instances that don't share cookies
2011-03-09T05:56:08  *** davehunt|away_ has joined #selenium
2011-03-09T05:56:10  <RossPatterson> That should be the normal behavior.  Selenium RC starts each Firefox instance with a unique, temporary profile, so there ought not to be any cookine sharing happening.
2011-03-09T05:56:20  <jqp> oh, awesome
2011-03-09T05:56:37  <RossPatterson> Are you currently creating a profile and telling RC to use it?

2011-03-09T05:56:54  <RossPatterson> Then relax and be happy :-)
2011-03-09T05:57:10  <jqp> indeed, thanks for the information
2011-03-09T05:57:24  <RossPatterson> FYI, this doesn't work for IE.
2011-03-09T05:58:07  *** esteele has joined #selenium
2011-03-09T06:01:17  <jqp> could i launch multiple firefox instances from one selenium rc instances that way, or would it be better to launch multiple selenium rc instances each running multiple firefox instances?
2011-03-09T06:03:39  <RossPatterson> A single RC can launch and drive many browsers, no problem.  Each time your client creates a new DefaultSelenium instance (or whatever name your language uses for it), your Start() will create a new browser instance.  Don't forget to Stop() them when you're done :-)

2011-03-09T08:19:45  <XCulver> any idea why my tests would switch from ie32 to ie64 mid test then only use ie64 after that?
2011-03-09T08:20:18  <jimevans> XCulver: that might depend on the language binding.
2011-03-09T08:20:31  <XCulver> c#.net
2011-03-09T08:21:17  <jimevans> Okay, then the language binding should detect the process bit-ness, and launch the appropriate bit-ness browser.
2011-03-09T08:22:32  <XCulver> based on how i compiled my solution?

2011-03-09T08:24:19  <jimevans> how are you running your tests?
2011-03-09T08:24:59  <XCulver> a hudson slave runs my msbuild.xml script
2011-03-09T08:25:11  <XCulver> that sets my dll's and configs
2011-03-09T08:25:18  <XCulver> then loads nunit
2011-03-09T08:25:24  <XCulver> loads the dll's into nunit
2011-03-09T08:25:28  <XCulver> nunit_console.exe
2011-03-09T08:26:15  <jimevans> does everything run as a single task, or do you have multiple executions of nunit-console.exe in your hudson job(s)?
2011-03-09T08:26:43  <XCulver> Everything is contained in one dll for the tests
2011-03-09T08:26:50  <XCulver> it would run multiple times
2011-03-09T08:26:56  <XCulver> if multiple browsers are enabled
2011-03-09T08:27:22  <XCulver> it loads a new config file for each browser
2011-03-09T08:27:29  <XCulver> using the same .dll into the nunit console
2011-03-09T08:27:43  <jimevans> see, the tricky bit is the native code. x64 processes can't load 32-bit dlls and vice versa.
2011-03-09T08:28:01  <XCulver> yah
2011-03-09T08:28:04  <XCulver> weird part is
2011-03-09T08:28:07  <XCulver> firefox works
2011-03-09T08:28:08  <XCulver> and ie did work
2011-03-09T08:28:12  <XCulver> right during a test
2011-03-09T08:28:20  <XCulver> i watched it load ie64 while it had ie32 open
2011-03-09T08:28:29  <XCulver> since then it wont go through ie32
2011-03-09T08:29:05  <XCulver> trying to just disable ie64
2011-03-09T08:29:08  <jimevans> well, firefox is 32-bit only at the moment, so that's not surprising.
2011-03-09T08:29:21  <jimevans> hold on a second. i want to try something.
2011-03-09T08:29:24  <XCulver> is selenium supposed to work with ie64?

2011-03-09T08:32:16  <jimevans> if you're project is compiled under "Any CPU", and you're on an x64 system, you (should) get IE64 for your tests.
2011-03-09T08:32:36  <XCulver> when it hits ie64 it wont work
2011-03-09T08:33:06  <jimevans> That said, if you want to force 32-bit IE, you can run under nunit-console-x86.exe

2011-03-09T08:33:20  <XCulver> good to know
2011-03-09T08:33:27  <jimevans> what happens when it launches 64-bit IE?
2011-03-09T08:34:34  <jimevans> I'm concerned, because if all of your tests are in a single assembly, there shouldn't be any bit-ness switching midstream.
2011-03-09T08:34:38  <XCulver> it loads the inbetween page(I never remember the technical name for it, proxy page?) then it try's to load my page hosted on iis and says page can't be displayed
2011-03-09T08:34:47  <XCulver> let me check something though

2011-03-09T08:35:37  <XCulver> and i'm definately going to try nunit-console-x86
2011-03-09T08:35:50  <jimevans> in the meantime, what OS is this?
2011-03-09T08:35:56  <XCulver> win764
2011-03-09T08:36:20  <jimevans> okay, that's my usual operating environment too.

2011-03-09T08:36:52  <jimevans> i'm assuming that your protected mode settings are set correctly.
2011-03-09T08:37:09  <XCulver> all the same right?
2011-03-09T08:37:15  <jimevans> yes
2011-03-09T08:39:02  <XCulver> i'll check if ie64 has that, didnt consider if they have seperate settings
2011-03-09T08:39:09  *** lfryc has quit IRC
2011-03-09T08:39:11  <XCulver> aka, if ie64 has em all the same too
2011-03-09T08:39:35  <jimevans> IE settings should be the same for both, I think, but worth checking.
2011-03-09T08:41:52  <XCulver> looks the same
2011-03-09T08:41:58  <XCulver> finished re-installing
2011-03-09T08:46:20  *** nirvdrum has joined #selenium
2011-03-09T08:46:39  <XCulver> may have just been the security settings
2011-03-09T08:46:45  <XCulver> that somehow got changed when it went to 64
2011-03-09T08:46:52  <XCulver> now its only loading 64 but its working
2011-03-09T08:47:03  <XCulver> and i just reinstalled ie8 and changed the security settings all the same
2011-03-09T08:47:06  <jimevans> ok
2011-03-09T08:47:56  <XCulver> i do get      System.InvalidOperationException : Unable to find element with xpath == //div[@class='main-content-padder']//h2 (UnexpectedJavaScriptError)
2011-03-09T08:47:56  <XCulver> though
2011-03-09T08:51:11  <XCulver> worked 2nd time around
2011-03-09T08:51:20  <XCulver> chalked up to blue moon and solar radiation for now
2011-03-09T08:51:52  <XCulver> thanks again chuckevans or is it jimnorris?
2011-03-09T08:52:03  <jimevans> lol!
2011-03-09T08:52:17  <jimevans> I don't feel like I did much to help, but you're welcome.
2011-03-09T08:52:30  <XCulver> hah
2011-03-09T08:52:31  <XCulver> still
2011-03-09T08:52:48  <XCulver> question about the conference
2011-03-09T08:52:59  *** sburjan has quit IRC
2011-03-09T08:53:04  <XCulver> im thinking of going
2011-03-09T08:53:10  <XCulver> and seeing if i can get my company to sponsor me
2011-03-09T08:53:14  <jimevans> okay, great!
2011-03-09T08:53:17  <XCulver> but i wont if too much of it will be over my head
2011-03-09T08:53:20  <XCulver> as i'm still new at this
2011-03-09T08:53:27  <XCulver> i dont want to waste their $
2011-03-09T08:53:35  <XCulver> they prefer web training
2011-03-09T08:53:55  <XCulver> my testing is all .net asp stuff
2011-03-09T08:54:01  <XCulver> so i use.net for dev
2011-03-09T08:54:46  <XCulver> any arguments i have for going?
2011-03-09T08:55:13  <XCulver> you know who i can talk to for helping me with what i can present to my employers for my case to go?
2011-03-09T08:55:13  <jimevans> Looking at the speaker list and proposed talks list, I think you'd probably get *something* out of it.
2011-03-09T08:55:19  <XCulver> right
2011-03-09T08:55:23  <XCulver> but cost wise
2011-03-09T08:55:28  <XCulver> i'm coming from Fargo, ND
2011-03-09T08:55:44  <jimevans> Additionally, it's one of the few times you'll have a large number of the core team all in one place as a resource.
2011-03-09T08:55:54  <XCulver> besides here!
2011-03-09T08:56:03  <jimevans> well, in person, i mean ;)
2011-03-09T08:56:06  <XCulver> right
2011-03-09T08:56:09  <XCulver> one reason i'd love to go
2011-03-09T08:56:21  <XCulver> eventually i'd like to start working on this myself
2011-03-09T08:56:35  <XCulver> i'm looking to do opensource work sometime
2011-03-09T08:56:58  <jimevans> I know there are some times where people will be available for pair-programming and hack sessions too.
2011-03-09T08:57:41  <XCulver> ok
2011-03-09T08:57:47  <XCulver> if anything i'll just use vacation
2011-03-09T08:57:48  <jimevans> Adam Christian's talk looks especially interesting for people just getting started with automated testing.
2011-03-09T08:57:49  <XCulver> hah
2011-03-09T08:57:53  <XCulver> kk
2011-03-09T08:57:55  <XCulver> let me look at his
2011-03-09T08:58:48  <XCulver> ohh
2011-03-09T08:58:58  <XCulver> you ever do anything tying in test results into sharepoint?
2011-03-09T08:59:04  <jimevans> I did hear (via Twitter?) that there are only about 10 seats left at the conference.
2011-03-09T08:59:09  <XCulver> ahh
2011-03-09T08:59:11  <XCulver> good to know
2011-03-09T08:59:14  *** True_Blue has joined #selenium
2011-03-09T08:59:21  <XCulver> i'll have something written up for them tonight
2011-03-09T08:59:27  <XCulver> they should let me know in a few days
2011-03-09T08:59:45  <XCulver> if not, i'll watch the webcasts
2011-03-09T08:59:47  <jimevans> I don't do much with automation tying into sharepoint no. We're using TFS here at work.
2011-03-09T08:59:49  <XCulver> if they exists
2011-03-09T08:59:53  <XCulver> ahh kk
2011-03-09T09:00:09  <True_Blue> I've been running my tests with the InternetExplorerDriver on Windows 7, and after the first test closes the browser, the second test can't open a new browser window.  Has anyone else come across this problem?
2011-03-09T09:00:12  <XCulver> i love tfs bug/submit integration
2011-03-09T09:00:35  <jimevans> I'm assured that the presentations will be recorded/webcast. Dunno if simultaneous webcast, though.
2011-03-09T09:00:53  <jimevans> True_Blue: what version of Selenium?
2011-03-09T09:01:20  <jimevans> and what language?
2011-03-09T09:01:34  <True_Blue> 2.0b2
2011-03-09T09:01:36  <True_Blue> Using java
2011-03-09T09:01:48  <True_Blue> I've had no problems with the FirefoxWebDriver
2011-03-09T09:02:04  <True_Blue> it throws "org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: org.apache.http.conn.HttpHostConnectException: Connection to http://localhost:55088 refused"
2011-03-09T09:02:05  *** csanchez has joined #selenium
2011-03-09T09:02:44  <jimevans> Are you properly using the quit() method of the driver when you attempt to close the window?
2011-03-09T09:03:17  <jimevans> The IE driver native code doesn't quite respect the semantics of the close() method yet as documented in the javadocs.
2011-03-09T09:03:35  <True_Blue> I don't beloeve so.  I'm cycling through the open windows and calling close() on each one
2011-03-09T09:03:52  <True_Blue> I see
2011-03-09T09:04:00  <jimevans> Try adding a driver.quit() at the end before attempting to open a new browser instance.
2011-03-09T09:04:58  <True_Blue> I'll give it a try now
2011-03-09T09:05:11  <jimevans> True_Blue: btw, the "not respecting close() semantics" thing is a temporary issue, but the fix likely won't make it into 2.0b3.
2011-03-09T09:05:25  <True_Blue> It worked, thank you very much
2011-03-09T09:05:32  <jimevans> np
2011-03-09T09:05:36  <True_Blue> I just updated from a1 to b2 today
2011-03-09T09:05:41  <True_Blue> I think it was a1
2011-03-09T09:05:59  <True_Blue> I'm hoping to see the ChromeDriver improved here soon
2011-03-09T09:06:05  <True_Blue> Right now I have been focusing on Firefox and IE
2011-03-09T09:06:15  <jimevans> wow, that's a big change. the IE driver was totally rewritten between 2.0a7 and 2.0b1.
2011-03-09T09:06:47  <True_Blue> ahh I see.  Actually, I mispoke.  I've had b1 for about 2 weeks now
2011-03-09T09:06:47  <jimevans> there are big changes in the ChromeDriver coming soon-ish, but they depend on changes in the Chromium project tree.
2011-03-09T09:07:03  <True_Blue> I saw a lot of talk about the ChromeDriver online
2011-03-09T09:07:10  <True_Blue> So I have been holding off until there's more progress
2011-03-09T09:07:51  <True_Blue> I've noticed with most of my tests, after a click(), I need to insert a Thread.sleep(250) before I kick off my asserts, for the InternetExplorerDriver
2011-03-09T09:08:08  <True_Blue> It seems like the IEDriver doesn't wait quite long enough
2011-03-09T09:08:22  <jimevans> The Chromium team is building a version of the Chrome driver. Once that's released, we can overhaul the Chrome bits in Selenium
2011-03-09T09:08:36  <simonstewart> The chromium stuff is looking good
2011-03-09T09:08:46  <simonstewart> I _think_ it'll make the cut for Chrome 11
2011-03-09T09:08:48  <jarib> i tried running the ruby Se2 ruby tests against chromedriver: http://files.jaribakken.com/selenium2/spec-results/2011-03-06/chromedriver.html
2011-03-09T09:09:08  <simonstewart> jarib: Jason got the list of bugs
2011-03-09T09:09:12  <jarib> yep
2011-03-09T09:09:28  <jimevans> True_Blue: that depends on what you're trying to assert. :)
2011-03-09T09:09:28  <jarib> just to give a picture of where it's at currently
2011-03-09T09:09:42  <jarib> looks very promising
2011-03-09T09:10:47  <jimevans> True_Blue: you have to remember that clicks are asynchronous on Windows. there's no guarantee that the driver will wait for the click to complete.
2011-03-09T09:11:26  <simonstewart> Well, the click completes. It's the browser that might not have finished handling the click that's the problem
2011-03-09T09:11:46  <True_Blue> I can understand that.  I'm just trying to now tweak my tests that are fully working in Firefox, to also work in IE
2011-03-09T09:11:47  <jimevans> sorry. of course you're right, simonstewart.
2011-03-09T09:11:58  <jimevans> I wasn't precise. :)
2011-03-09T09:11:59  <True_Blue> And one of the ways I can fix the click, is to add a small sleep after each one
2011-03-09T09:12:03  <simonstewart> I'm obviously feeling in a nit-picky mood today
2011-03-09T09:12:06  <simonstewart> Soz
2011-03-09T09:12:18  <simonstewart> True_Blue: take a look at the implicit waits
2011-03-09T09:12:21  <jimevans> no worries mate. i've had something of a day myself.
2011-03-09T09:12:35  <True_Blue> I was hoping to eventually overwrite the click() method to instead do a click() and sleep whenever a tester does a .click on a WebElement
2011-03-09T09:12:35  <simonstewart> IE6?
2011-03-09T09:12:43  <True_Blue> I'll take a look at it
2011-03-09T09:12:55  <simonstewart> They'll do exactly what you want by the sound of things?
2011-03-09T09:13:17  <True_Blue> I'm not sure, since I don't have much knowledge of implicit waits
2011-03-09T09:13:28  <True_Blue> I'm googling it now, do you have a good source you can point me to?
2011-03-09T09:13:39  <simonstewart> They're the same as polling up to a time limit for an element to be present
2011-03-09T09:13:52  <simonstewart> driver.manage() is the key
2011-03-09T09:13:53  <jimevans> no, personal stuff. IE6 works much better after r11621

2011-03-09T09:16:59  <benmonty> hi all. i'm wondering if anybody has tried using selenium to test a framed facebook app. i'm running into issues selecting my app's frame with all versions of ie (works fine in other browsers. also, ie tests work when hitting the framed page directly)
2011-03-09T09:17:17  <True_Blue> So if I do a driver.manage.timeouts.implicitelyWait, when I go to find the element to assert on after a click(), it should wait a couple seconds before timing out?
2011-03-09T09:17:44  <jimevans> benmonty: what issues are you running into?
2011-03-09T09:19:24  *** ian_mac_ has quit IRC
2011-03-09T09:21:39  <benmonty> jimevans: it's difficult for me to pinpoint exactly what the issue is. it appears that selenium is unable to detect a frame element (by id, in this case).
2011-03-09T09:22:30  <True_Blue> Thanks for the help
2011-03-09T09:22:39  <True_Blue> quit() solves my IE problem
2011-03-09T09:22:41  <benmonty> jimevans: i started out testing on saucelabs, had errors, then tried to investigate using a windows ec2 instance to see whether this was a saucelabs issue or a selenium issue (or just my issue)
2011-03-09T09:22:50  <True_Blue> And it looks like Implicet Waits solves my other
2011-03-09T09:23:00  <jimevans> True_Blue: great to hear!
2011-03-09T09:23:59  <jimevans> benmonty: okay, so you were using saucelabs, so that implies the Selenium 1.x (or RC) API, right?
2011-03-09T09:24:07  <benmonty> yes
2011-03-09T09:24:35  <benmonty> I'm using perl bindings. Test::WWW::Selenium
2011-03-09T09:24:57  <jimevans> Okay, then somebody else is going to have to step up. I don't really know anything about the 1.x architecture, or even how to debug the issue.
2011-03-09T09:25:34  <benmonty> jimevans: thanks anyway :)
2011-03-09T09:26:31  <jimevans> the first thing I would suspect is a problem with different domains within the frames, but that's my ignorance of 1.x showing.
2011-03-09T09:29:34  <benmonty> hmm... I'll keep investigating and I'll write up a detailed problem description with a test case
2011-03-09T09:30:27  <benmonty> ie 6-8 pass the simple test (verifytextpresent) when hitting the framed page directly
2011-03-09T09:30:50  <benmonty> but the test blows up when hitting facebook's domain and attempting to select the frame
2011-03-09T09:34:10  <True_Blue> Is there an easy way to add methods to the WebElement interface?  Right now I have a method that is clearAndSendKeys(WebElement element, String str) which takes an element and does a clear() on it first, and then sendKeys(str).  I would rather do a findElement(By.id("textfield")).clearAndSendKeys(str)

2011-03-09T09:43:27  <True_Blue> Implicit waits seem to work great if what you are doing is looking for an element.  If I do a click() and then am trying to assert that a String is present in driver.getCurrentUrl(), the implicit wait does not go into affect and I get an error.
2011-03-09T09:43:51  <True_Blue> I think it would be better to have a wait happen after each click(), then have a wait happen for each Element
2011-03-09T09:43:56  *** zmijunkie has joined #selenium
2011-03-09T09:43:59  <True_Blue> Because then it would apply for everything
2011-03-09T09:44:14  <simonstewart> What would you be waiting for, though?
2011-03-09T09:45:55  <True_Blue> I have found that for the IEDriver, after each click(), if I add a Thread.sleep(250), after the click is done it waits just long enough that I now can do a driver.getCurrentUrl() and the correct url is returned
2011-03-09T09:46:10  <True_Blue> If I do not have that Thread.sleep, then it picks up the url of before the click
2011-03-09T09:46:19  <True_Blue> so, the url from the first page
2011-03-09T09:47:37  <True_Blue> Its one of the reasons why I was looking into overriding the click() command, so that I could do a click() and a Thread.sleep() whenever a tester would type click().  This way they wouldn't have to remember to add a Thread.sleep() everytime before asserts that arent using elements
2011-03-09T09:47:38  <balooo> True_Blue: could you not wait for something to be visibel
2011-03-09T09:47:48  <True_Blue> I probably could
2011-03-09T09:47:58  <True_Blue> I could add a findElement beforehand
2011-03-09T09:48:01  <balooo> that 'sounds' safer, but i'm no expert
2011-03-09T09:49:05  *** nitin_ has joined #selenium
2011-03-09T09:49:16  <True_Blue> On each page, I would have to do a findElement with some unique element before I could go on to my asserts that use things that arent elements, like currentURL, pagesource, etc
2011-03-09T09:49:19  <balooo> not findElement?  I meant wait.until(<some implementation of ExpectedCondition>)
2011-03-09T09:49:31  *** dhackner has joined #selenium
2011-03-09T09:49:43  <True_Blue> I have a wait.until method that I use that I call waitForElement
2011-03-09T09:49:46  <True_Blue> instead of findElement
2011-03-09T09:50:00  <True_Blue> It just seems easier to just add that fourth of a second wait to after the click()
2011-03-09T09:50:11  <True_Blue> Instead of having to put a unique waitForElement after each one

2011-03-09T09:53:59  <simonstewart> But TrueBlue needs to know _what_ he's waiting for
2011-03-09T09:54:18  <jimevans> indeed.
2011-03-09T09:54:21  <benmonty> simonstewart: after changing the frame selector from id=iframe_canvas to dom=window.frames[0], ie8 started to pass the test
2011-03-09T09:54:41  <simonstewart> Now that's odd
2011-03-09T09:54:46  <simonstewart> But good to know
2011-03-09T09:55:11  <benmonty> ie 6/7 still fail, but that could be for other reasons, heh
2011-03-09T09:56:10  <benmonty> it's also possible that facebook does some special hacking for ie browsers... who knows
2011-03-09T09:57:57  <True_Blue> If it was an element, I would know what to wait for.  So, I have a method set up now called waitForElement that utilizes wait.until(condition).  This works great for elements.  I have found that if I am wanting to find driver.getCurrentUrl(), there really isn't anything to wait for, every page I am on has a url.  This means I will always get a response.  The problem is that after I do a
2011-03-09T09:57:57  <True_Blue> click() in the IEDriver, it moves on to the getCurrentUrl() method too quickly and picks up the first pages url, not the second pages
2011-03-09T09:58:12  <True_Blue> I have found that a Thread.sleep(250) gives sufficient time for it to now pick up the second pages url
2011-03-09T09:58:58  <True_Blue> I understand that a Thread.sleep is usually worse than a wait
2011-03-09T09:59:08  <True_Blue> But in this case, I can't think of a better solution
2011-03-09T09:59:17  <jimevans> True_Blue: yes, but could you not wait for the return value of getCurrentUrl() to contain the value you want?
2011-03-09T10:00:22  <True_Blue> true
2011-03-09T10:00:33  <True_Blue> That's a good point
2011-03-09T10:01:05  <True_Blue> Basically, I would add the wait into the assert method
2011-03-09T10:01:14  <True_Blue> and only throw an error after a certain amount of time
2011-03-09T10:01:20  <True_Blue> Most of mine are keyed off of 5 seconds
2011-03-09T10:03:29  <True_Blue> thanks for the advice, I will try it out and see if I can get it to work correct
2011-03-09T10:03:57  <True_Blue> I would have to do the driver.getCurrentUrl within the assert
2011-03-09T10:04:11  <True_Blue> Right now currently, I am passing in the String that comes from driver.getCurrentUrl()
2011-03-09T10:04:19  <True_Blue> Which would never change, so the wait wouldn't do anything

2011-03-09T10:35:21  <Richlv> how can i figure out windowid for "waitForPopUp ( windowID,timeout )" ?
2011-03-09T10:36:58  <RossPatterson> Richlv: As a non-programmer, it's kinda hard.  The answer is "it's the name used on the JavaScript open() call that created the window", but you have to look at the application source code to know what that is.
2011-03-09T10:37:26  <XCulver> jimevans: vwala! (By.XPath("//h2[contains(text(),'Login')]"));
2011-03-09T10:39:43  <jimevans> XCulver: excellent.

2011-03-09T10:41:01  <Richlv> RossPatterson, if i see in the page source something that starts with "onclick="return PopUp('popup.php?dstfrm=web.hosts.host.php", is that something found nearby ?
2011-03-09T10:45:52  <RossPatterson> Richlv: Alas, no.  That means that your application developers have created their own routine called "PopUp", which eventually calls window.open() itself, but we don't know what window name it passes to open().  If you can find the open(), the name is the second parameter (e.g, "window.open(myUrl, 'myWindowName')").

2011-03-09T12:39:14  <jarib> jimevans: does Windows/VS have some sort of valgrind equivalent?
2011-03-09T12:39:29  <jimevans> jarib: i don't think so.
2011-03-09T12:39:44  <jimevans> or more correctly, i'm sure there is, but i don't know what it is.
2011-03-09T12:40:25  <jarib> oh, wow, i remember now
2011-03-09T12:40:29  *** skiphuffman_ has quit IRC
2011-03-09T12:41:09  <jarib> chromium actually runs valgrind with windows binaries by using *wine*
2011-03-09T12:41:18  <jarib> that's just crazy.

2011-03-09T13:13:39  <XCulver> what do you guys think of var test2 = CurrentWebDriver.FindElement(By.TagName("h2"), e => e.Text == "Login"); as a text search?
2011-03-09T13:14:00  <XCulver> using an extension to selenium w/ linq
2011-03-09T13:14:19  <XCulver> variable tagname
2011-03-09T13:14:22  <XCulver> and text search
2011-03-09T13:18:17  <Richlv> RossPatterson, huh, it looks like that specific instance calls popup function with passing "form_name" which is eventually used in the open call, but it has a line to set default name. so it looks like i have found that variable - thanks :)
2011-03-09T13:25:28  <antlong> XCulver, looks sound. in python it would be,  assert driver.find_element_by_whatever('foo') == "Login"
2011-03-09T13:26:18  <antlong> XCulver, can you do CurrentWebDriver.FindElement(By.TagName("h2").Text == "Login" ?
2011-03-09T13:27:03  <jimevans> antlong: XCulver is proposing an extension to the FindElement method to be able to chain things together.
2011-03-09T13:27:16  <antlong> ah gotcha
2011-03-09T13:27:23  <antlong> tardy to the party :)
2011-03-09T13:27:26  <Richlv> hmm. looks like i also have to waitforelement - a specific "a href" element inside li block with specific "class" definition. but i feel like i'm way over my head already :/
2011-03-09T13:28:07  <jimevans> XCulver: that's actually a nice idea.
2011-03-09T13:28:27  <antlong> Richlv, //li[contains(@class, 'foo' and contains(href, 'bar')]
2011-03-09T13:28:34  <jimevans> the .NET bindings don't have a complete 1:1 mapping of the stuff in the Java support package. Such an extension moght be right at home there.
2011-03-09T13:29:05  <Richlv> antlong, mm, that looks parseable to me - thanks, off to try it out ;)

2011-03-09T13:34:00  <antlong> jimevans can you do submethods in .net?, like  some_method.submethod which deviates the data from some_method in some way
2011-03-09T13:36:50  <Richlv> antlong, hmm... is that string specified as a param for waitForElementPresent ? if yes, do i enclose it in single quotes ? if yes, what to do about singlequotes in the string itself ? :)
2011-03-09T13:39:19  <antlong> Richlv, its an xpath, pass it in like you would any other
2011-03-09T13:41:06  <jimevans> antlong: no, .NET doesn't support such a construct.

2011-03-09T14:37:10  <Archdude> what are you trying to do there?
2011-03-09T14:37:23  <Archdude> specifically
2011-03-09T14:39:09  <rethus1> i try to click all the banners one after each other with 3 seconds between
2011-03-09T14:39:28  <rethus1> i try now since 2 days, and got nothing to work.
2011-03-09T14:40:01  <rethus1> its to hard, cause all elements into div id=weaselcontent are random
2011-03-09T14:40:06  <Archdude> did you try a regular click with the xpath
2011-03-09T14:40:10  <Archdude> and pause 3 seconds inbetween?
2011-03-09T14:40:16  <Archdude> u can do a contains
2011-03-09T14:40:23  <Archdude> like
2011-03-09T14:40:25  <rethus1> i got no xpath, which point exactly
2011-03-09T14:40:44  <Archdude> /a[contains(@href, 'sometext')]
2011-03-09T14:41:12  <rethus1> i didn't know the id, the link or anything else of the element
2011-03-09T14:41:15  <Archdude> are you trying to click the banners on the right side of that page u sent us?
2011-03-09T14:41:16  <rethus1> its randomized
2011-03-09T14:41:42  <rethus1> what u mean with right side?
2011-03-09T14:42:12  <Archdude> u can also use clickAt
2011-03-09T14:42:36  <rethus1> i've try this. but it points nowhere
2011-03-09T14:44:46  <rethus1> example: i try clickAt : xpath=//*[@id="weaselcontent"] : 50,50
2011-03-09T14:44:48  <rethus1> nothing
2011-03-09T14:46:39  <antlong> rethus1 link me the page

2011-03-09T14:47:14  <Archdude> page is blank
2011-03-09T14:47:36  <antlong> lol
2011-03-09T14:47:47  <Archdude> maybe thats why you can't click anything ;)
2011-03-09T14:48:01  <rethus1> its a password-protected page
2011-03-09T14:48:09  <antlong> theres no prompt for a login
2011-03-09T14:48:12  <antlong> its just a blank page
2011-03-09T14:48:14  <rethus1> therefor i have send it to jslint
2011-03-09T14:49:59  <antlong> no clue what youre talking about
2011-03-09T14:50:11  <antlong> but the page is blank, so that could be a contributing factor to why you cant click anything
2011-03-09T14:51:29  <Archdude> judging by the other link you sent
2011-03-09T14:51:30  <Archdude> try
2011-03-09T14:51:38  <Archdude> /tr[@onmouseover='showDetails(2);'] with the coord 0,0
2011-03-09T14:51:39  <Archdude> could work
2011-03-09T14:51:54  <Archdude> although idk for sure until you send a working link
2011-03-09T14:51:55  <Archdude> lol

2011-03-09T14:54:23  <Archdude> havent noticed that before
2011-03-09T14:54:26  <Archdude> pretty cool
2011-03-09T14:55:06  <antlong> cant say ill have a use for it
2011-03-09T14:55:10  <antlong> but it looks cool
2011-03-09T14:55:24  <Archdude> on sunday i spent an hour or two hacking around w/ a OS X Lion image to get it to run in vmware since it's not supposed to its just an upgrade
2011-03-09T14:55:37  <Archdude> an*
2011-03-09T14:55:48  <antlong> howd it turn out?
2011-03-09T14:55:59  <antlong> os-x vm's are incredibly slow
2011-03-09T14:56:01  <Archdude> after 2 hours of getting it to work i used it for 5 minutes and shut it off
2011-03-09T14:56:02  <Archdude> lol
2011-03-09T14:56:06  <antlong> ha nice
2011-03-09T14:56:09  <antlong> time well spent
2011-03-09T14:56:13  <Archdude> its just very iOS-y
2011-03-09T14:57:05  <Archdude> nothing too impressive
2011-03-09T15:01:13  <rethus1> Archdud: k seems to be near to the solution.
2011-03-09T15:01:14  <rethus1> xpath=//tr[@onmouseover='showDetails(1);']
2011-03-09T15:01:23  <Archdude> yes
2011-03-09T15:01:37  <rethus1> how can i now do a mouseup on td/div below this element
2011-03-09T15:01:40  <Archdude> showDetails(1), (2), (3), etc
2011-03-09T15:02:12  <rethus1> the banner-activation still not work... i think i need exactly the div inside the td ?!
2011-03-09T15:02:15  <Archdude> mouseUp with the xpath and a value of 1
2011-03-09T15:03:30  <Archdude> is your goal just to click on a bunch of ads and lower its RPM?
2011-03-09T15:03:31  <Archdude> lol
2011-03-09T15:03:44  <rethus1> yehaa the click works now
2011-03-09T15:03:49  <Archdude> there u go
2011-03-09T15:03:53  <rethus1> how can i inkrement the counter
2011-03-09T15:04:09  <rethus1> selenium is realy cool stuff
2011-03-09T15:04:38  <Archdude> counter for the number in showDetails?
2011-03-09T15:05:03  <rethus1> yes
2011-03-09T15:05:03  <Archdude> where in .de are you from?
2011-03-09T15:05:12  <Archdude> how many are there going to be?
2011-03-09T15:05:18  <rethus1> near cologne
2011-03-09T15:05:23  <rethus1> 10
2011-03-09T15:05:29  <Archdude> id just do it manually if it's only 10
2011-03-09T15:08:05  <rethus1> ok. another question: the click on the link opens a new window. how can i close it automaticly
2011-03-09T15:08:15  <Archdude> close command
2011-03-09T15:08:36  <rethus1> yes, but how can i get the name of the popup window
2011-03-09T15:08:37  <Archdude> might have to do a selectWindow inbetween
2011-03-09T15:08:46  <Archdude> does it have a title?
2011-03-09T15:08:48  <Archdude> u can use that
2011-03-09T15:09:10  <Archdude> i think in IDE you can just do
2011-03-09T15:09:12  <Archdude> close with nothing else
2011-03-09T15:09:20  <Archdude> once you've selected it as the active window
2011-03-09T15:09:33  <Archdude> use selectWindow title=Title here
2011-03-09T15:09:35  <Archdude> then close

2011-03-09T15:11:58  <Archdude> cool
2011-03-09T15:13:30  <rethus1> should selenium find it, if i click on "find it" button?

2011-03-09T15:14:14  <Archdude> no "
2011-03-09T15:15:07  <rethus1> ok, so i have to run the script to test it
2011-03-09T15:15:23  <rethus1> if i have 3 windows with this title, would all windows closed?
2011-03-09T15:15:52  <Archdude> do it actively

2011-03-09T15:15:58  <Archdude> close window

2011-03-09T15:16:04  <Archdude> etc
2011-03-09T15:16:52  <rethus1> can i repeat the whole testcase 10 times?
2011-03-09T15:17:13  <Archdude> no
2011-03-09T15:17:16  <Archdude> copy and paste it 10 times

2011-03-09T17:26:29  <tim> i'm using Selenium Grid v1.0.8 for my tests on Safari 5 on OSX (10.6.6). I've tried using *safari and *safariproxy, (with pop up window allowed) but it always stuck at the first browser window that shows "redirect_to_got_to_selenium.htm"
2011-03-09T17:26:52  <tim> it seems the issue still exists http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=573
2011-03-09T17:27:09  <tim> did anyone else get safari 5 to work on OSX 10.6.6?
