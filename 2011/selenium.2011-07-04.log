2011-07-04T01:05:37  <freynaud> davehunt: Hi
2011-07-04T01:05:46  <davehunt> simonstewart: I'd like to check with freynaud and nirvdrum first :) 2.0rc3 was a bit broken for Grid
2011-07-04T01:05:58  <freynaud> davehunt:  that would help a lot. I changed a lot yesterday
2011-07-04T01:06:05  <simonstewart> freynaud: are we good to go for 2.0?
2011-07-04T01:06:16  <freynaud> davehunt: the plan is to have change = bug fix, but who knows :)
2011-07-04T01:06:20  <davehunt> okay, I will update and build locally, and test it
2011-07-04T01:06:22  <samitbadle> davehunt: Reply from samitbadle: bytes=32 time<10mins TTL=?
2011-07-04T01:06:49  <freynaud> simonstewart: it shoud be ok + all tests passing, but it would be good to have davehunt have a look at it first

2011-07-04T01:07:33  <simonstewart> That enough time?
2011-07-04T01:07:37  <davehunt> should be
2011-07-04T01:07:48  <davehunt> I hope it will take much less
2011-07-04T01:07:49  <freynaud> davehunt:  the changes are bug fix with the param and all that, node registering themselves again after hub crash, and config inherited from hub
2011-07-04T01:07:54  <simonstewart> Great :) Sooner would be better
2011-07-04T01:08:55  <davehunt> samitbadle: When you're next in town I suggest attacking the open Se IDE bugs together
2011-07-04T01:09:02  <simonstewart> You know, I'm very temped to use "2.0" rather than "2.0.0"
2011-07-04T01:09:09  * davehunt likes 2.0
2011-07-04T01:09:13  <simonstewart> I can't really see us doing revision ticks

2011-07-04T01:09:48  <simonstewart> Which was the other piece of information we would have encoded in the version number
2011-07-04T01:09:58  <samitbadle> davehunt: sounds like a great plan
2011-07-04T01:10:04  <davehunt> simonstewart: are we planning on having 'nightly' builds available too :)
2011-07-04T01:10:28  <simonstewart> Wasn't planning on it
2011-07-04T01:10:29  <freynaud> simonstewart: 2.0.X makes sense if the CI is reliable for me

2011-07-04T02:11:54  <simonstewart> it's not webdriver, but it's a dotnet framework based on watir
2011-07-04T02:12:37  <Binken_> I see there is watir-webdriver :)

2011-07-04T02:54:30  <AutomatedTester> grumpiness gone?>
2011-07-04T02:54:36  <simonstewart> Still amazingly grumpy
2011-07-04T02:54:41  <AutomatedTester> :/
2011-07-04T02:54:56  <simonstewart> Had an interesting chat with Eran about binary components in extensions
2011-07-04T02:54:58  <AutomatedTester> you have a new minion, that should make you happy
2011-07-04T02:55:21  <AutomatedTester> oh, whats that?
2011-07-04T02:55:35  <simonstewart> I'm starting to think that the new faster releases for mozilla are going to be fantastically painful
2011-07-04T02:55:57  <AutomatedTester> it *shouldnt* be
2011-07-04T02:55:57  <simonstewart> Each binary component needs a version number encoded in it at compile time
2011-07-04T02:56:15  <simonstewart> And that version number is only for a single major number release
2011-07-04T02:56:44  <simonstewart> So for the webdriver extension we go to OS * bitness * supported browsers
2011-07-04T02:56:46  <AutomatedTester> hmmm
2011-07-04T02:56:47  <simonstewart> of included DLLs
2011-07-04T02:56:55  <simonstewart> It's going to massively bloat the firefox jar
2011-07-04T02:57:12  <simonstewart> After 2.0 is out, we'll explore using jsctypes to sidestep as much as we can
2011-07-04T02:57:17  <simonstewart> But it's frickin' nasty
2011-07-04T02:57:44  <AutomatedTester> i wonder with the new SDK that is coming out if we can abuse that to solve a number of our issues
2011-07-04T02:57:58  <simonstewart> new sdk?
2011-07-04T02:58:03  <AutomatedTester> Addons SDK
2011-07-04T02:58:07  <simonstewart> handy
2011-07-04T02:58:23  <simonstewart> though we're very slow at adopting new stuff because we've got a long list of firefoxen to support
2011-07-04T02:58:29  <simonstewart> (we go all the way back to 3.0 for now)
2011-07-04T02:58:42  <AutomatedTester> do we need to go back that far?
2011-07-04T02:58:48  <simonstewart> Yes
2011-07-04T02:58:51  <AutomatedTester> why?
2011-07-04T02:58:52  <simonstewart> Sadly
2011-07-04T02:58:57  <simonstewart> Because people are still using it
2011-07-04T02:59:05  <freynaud> can't people update there browsers ?
2011-07-04T02:59:07  <simonstewart> And 3.0 is on the list of supported browsers for a number of major sites
2011-07-04T02:59:10  <simonstewart> Not always
2011-07-04T02:59:16  <simonstewart> It's why we also worry about IE 6

2011-07-04T03:00:08  <freynaud> why did you get rid of the andWait for the API ?
2011-07-04T03:00:18  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: one thing I wanted to do was see if we can use the SDK because it will create a more lightweight extension
2011-07-04T03:00:19  <simonstewart> eh?
2011-07-04T03:00:26  <freynaud> weither it loads a new page or not is something that I need to test
2011-07-04T03:00:28  <simonstewart> Right.
2011-07-04T03:00:40  <simonstewart> freynaud: I've not touched the "andWait" stuff
2011-07-04T03:00:47  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester; lightweight is good
2011-07-04T03:00:57  <AutomatedTester> exactly
2011-07-04T03:01:05  <simonstewart> And being able to say "Mozilla chose which browser to support" would also be good
2011-07-04T03:01:10  <simonstewart> Just sayin'
2011-07-04T03:01:13  <freynaud> simonstewart: I mean in general, it's not suddently broken
2011-07-04T03:01:23  <simonstewart> Which language?
2011-07-04T03:01:26  <simonstewart> Java?
2011-07-04T03:01:35  <AutomatedTester> we chose to support 3.6+
2011-07-04T03:01:35  <simonstewart> And when you say "it's gone" what do you mean?
2011-07-04T03:01:45  <simonstewart> I've not touched the Selenium APIs for aaaages
2011-07-04T03:01:58  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: right. I know the official support policy
2011-07-04T03:02:08  <simonstewart> But there's a surprising number of users who don't
2011-07-04T03:02:40  * AutomatedTester wonders if there are details on Metrics
2011-07-04T03:02:43  <freynaud> simonstewart: if click is not supposed to submit the page but it does, my impression is that I'll never see that because click just magically waitForPageToLoad if the page loads
2011-07-04T03:03:06  <simonstewart> freynaud: why do I feel like I'm lacking some context here
2011-07-04T03:03:08  <simonstewart> ?
2011-07-04T03:04:00  <freynaud> simonstewart: on eBay you have some huge pages that are supposed to be updated by ajax. Sometimes they aren't and it's a regular post
2011-07-04T03:04:11  <freynaud> can I catch that with webdriver ?
2011-07-04T03:04:18  <simonstewart> The halting problem?

2011-07-04T03:13:02  <AutomatedTester> i dont know the ins and outs but the AMO people seem to like it
2011-07-04T03:13:29  <eranm> My question about it boils down to this: Will it allow me to compile a binary component that can be used across multiple versions of Firefox?
2011-07-04T03:13:47  <eranm> At the moment, it seems that if I'm compiling using the Gecko SDK the answer to this question is a resounding no.

2011-07-04T03:47:21  <jimevans> i have.
2011-07-04T03:47:34  <jimevans> very nice information to have.
2011-07-04T03:48:02  <jimevans> That list is only tests that are ignored for some browser, correct?
2011-07-04T03:48:12  <jimevans> (not a comprehensive list of all tests)
2011-07-04T03:48:24  <simonstewart> I think so
2011-07-04T03:48:31  <simonstewart> It'd be nice to see the fields of green too :)
2011-07-04T03:48:47  <jimevans> One of my ongoing challenges is making sure the .NET tests cover the same ground as the Java tests.
2011-07-04T03:49:03  <simonstewart> Do we need to run the same tests on every platform?
2011-07-04T03:49:32  <jimevans> By "platform", I assume you mean "Probably not, but
2011-07-04T03:49:41  <jimevans> ^^ crap
2011-07-04T03:49:41  <simonstewart> Right
2011-07-04T03:49:47  <jimevans> let me try again
2011-07-04T03:49:47  <simonstewart> I got the idea :)
2011-07-04T03:50:01  <jimevans> By platform, i assume you meant "language binding"
2011-07-04T03:50:06  <simonstewart> Right
2011-07-04T03:50:54  <jimevans> Probably not, but I find it easier to use the .NET bindings in my everyday operating environment.
2011-07-04T03:51:05  <simonstewart> Fair point
2011-07-04T03:51:38  <jimevans> If I know that they cover the same set of functionality as the Java tests, I can run them, and then run the Java tests just before checking in.
2011-07-04T03:52:10  <simonstewart> I'm still working on a reliable piece of continuous build infrastructure
2011-07-04T03:52:10  <jimevans> It's particularly handy when working on the IE driver, since I'm in VS anyway.
2011-07-04T03:52:27  <simonstewart> Right
2011-07-04T03:53:27  <jarib> jimevans: yeah, i basically do `cat *Test.java | grep @Ignore` at this point. would be nice to have the full list
2011-07-04T03:53:44  <simonstewart> Might need a custom runner
2011-07-04T03:53:49  <simonstewart> Should be easy enough to write
2011-07-04T03:54:02  <jarib> yes please :)
2011-07-04T03:54:06  * simonstewart notes that he should have moved to junit4 yonks ago

2011-07-04T03:55:36  <simonstewart> The ElementFinder now warns people when they mistake sizzle for css
2011-07-04T03:55:37  <jarib> guess that's a prerequisite for the custom runner?
2011-07-04T03:55:42  <simonstewart> Right
2011-07-04T03:56:09  <jarib> is it mostly a mechanical change, like adding @Test?
2011-07-04T03:56:21  <simonstewart> The hardest thing is building the test suites
2011-07-04T03:56:25  <jarib> ah
2011-07-04T03:56:29  <jarib> i see.
2011-07-04T03:56:30  <simonstewart> I may brute force a mechanical solution for now
2011-07-04T03:56:38  <simonstewart> And then try and be clever elsewhere
2011-07-04T03:56:54  <jarib> probably not today's top priority though :)
2011-07-04T03:56:57  <simonstewart> Right
2011-07-04T03:57:04  <simonstewart> Though it's seldom a top priority
2011-07-04T03:57:09  <simonstewart> I might bump it up at some point
2011-07-04T03:57:53  <simonstewart> because it can't keep languishing at the bottom of the pile
2011-07-04T03:57:56  <simonstewart> Hmmm....
2011-07-04T03:58:09  <simonstewart> perhaps a day where we invert the troublesome nature of bugs
2011-07-04T03:58:18  <simonstewart> and deal with all those low priority ones

2011-07-04T04:03:47  <simonstewart> Whee!
2011-07-04T04:04:14  <simonstewart> Also, that's a heck of a lot of revisions

2011-07-04T04:05:43  <jimevans> still need to go update the license comment blocks, but that updates the assembly properties in the released artifacts.
2011-07-04T04:06:10  <simonstewart> I edit the license blocks as I edit the files
2011-07-04T04:06:26  <simonstewart> And we still need to get google and tw to finish assigning copyrights
2011-07-04T04:06:36  <jimevans> I see.
2011-07-04T04:06:50  <simonstewart> So, no hurry
2011-07-04T04:07:03  <jimevans> I need to decide whether I want to commit this extraction of common server-side C++ code
2011-07-04T04:07:18  <simonstewart> What are the pros and cons?
2011-07-04T04:07:56  <adamgoucher> good grief you people have been chatty this morning :)
2011-07-04T04:08:12  <jimevans> The plus side is that it makes it much easier for anyone else to come along and implement the server side of the wire protocol in C++
2011-07-04T04:08:27  <simonstewart> The con?
2011-07-04T04:08:39  * jimevans stares menacingly at headless WebKit drivers.
2011-07-04T04:08:48  <simonstewart> ha!
2011-07-04T04:09:02  <simonstewart> If you're worried about stability, we could commit post-2.0
2011-07-04T04:09:12  <jimevans> The potential downside is that I've royally screwed something up.
2011-07-04T04:09:25  <jimevans> I don't *think* I have. The tests pass.
2011-07-04T04:09:34  <simonstewart> That's normally a good sign
2011-07-04T04:09:37  <jimevans> I don't get any crashes.
2011-07-04T04:10:03  <jimevans> But I believe I'll wait for 2.0 RTW to commit.
2011-07-04T04:10:19  <simonstewart> OK. So it sounds like you'd like to have someone put this change through its paces before we push it to the world
2011-07-04T04:10:31  <simonstewart> Post 2.0 sounds like a sane thing to do
2011-07-04T04:10:37  <simonstewart> Though you could always check in on a branch
2011-07-04T04:10:45  <jimevans> I may yet do that.

2011-07-04T04:36:42  <AutomatedTester> davehunt: no, we need the beta -> aurora merger
2011-07-04T04:37:10  <davehunt> Hasn't that happened?
2011-07-04T04:37:22  <AutomatedTester> I thought its tomorrow
2011-07-04T04:37:31  <davehunt> Okay
2011-07-04T04:38:00  <davehunt> Why are we wanting to push 2.0 final out today?
2011-07-04T04:38:11  <davehunt> I'm not sure grid is quite ready
2011-07-04T04:41:02  <AutomatedTester> so with the whole toggle/set_selected stuff, what has happyed to is_element_selected?
2011-07-04T04:42:08  <jimevans> isSelected should still be correct.
2011-07-04T04:42:52  <jimevans> You still need a way to tell if an option in a select list is selected, or if a checkbox is checked.
2011-07-04T04:43:55  <AutomatedTester> well my tests are failing with click on some things
2011-07-04T04:45:15  <jimevans> that, to me, isn't surprising. :)
2011-07-04T04:46:16  <jimevans> I'm pretty sure IE works OK with the whole "use click to select" bit. Firefox and Chrome, I'm less certain about.
2011-07-04T04:46:32  <jimevans> Chrome has issues with it if memory serves.
2011-07-04T04:47:05  <AutomatedTester> i am not expecting chrome to work because the driver is out of date
2011-07-04T04:56:22  <simonstewart> davehunt: we want it today because today is a deadline

2011-07-04T04:56:41  * davehunt didn't realise there was a deadline
2011-07-04T04:56:57  * davehunt still doesn't think grid is ready
2011-07-04T04:56:57  <simonstewart> Also, with most of the US out, we get a "slow start" and can patch anything major we miss quickly
2011-07-04T04:57:08  <simonstewart> davehunt: what's up with grid?
2011-07-04T04:57:23  <simonstewart> Saying "it's not ready" doesn't provide the mechanism to decide when it is
2011-07-04T04:57:28  <davehunt> issues/confusions over configuration
2011-07-04T04:57:47  <simonstewart> Are these issues clearly defined somewhere?
2011-07-04T04:58:16  <simonstewart> (also, there's a whole heap of people still on 1.x because they can only use "stable" releases)
2011-07-04T04:58:18  <davehunt> the configuration isn't clearly defined anywhere...
2011-07-04T04:58:24  <simonstewart> So it's a docs issue?
2011-07-04T04:58:28  *** odix_ has quit IRC
2011-07-04T04:58:33  <davehunt> docs would be a start :)
2011-07-04T04:58:43  <simonstewart> Got some time to hack them up?
2011-07-04T04:59:00  <simonstewart> If you emailed freynaud some questions and he replied, could you convert that into something more widely useful?
2011-07-04T04:59:25  <davehunt> not really, because things still don't seem to be finished
2011-07-04T04:59:50  <simonstewart> "things"?
2011-07-04T05:00:24  <davehunt> I can't define what I am struggling to understand :D
2011-07-04T05:00:37  <simonstewart> OK. That's cool
2011-07-04T05:00:44  <simonstewart> And I trust your judgement
2011-07-04T05:00:55  <simonstewart> but I really need specific problems to address
2011-07-04T05:00:58  <freynaud> simonstewart: yes. I don't use grid out of the box, davehunt is, and he is facing stupid config issues I didn't do right
2011-07-04T05:01:15  <simonstewart> How hard are these issues to fix?
2011-07-04T05:01:50  <simonstewart> Because it'd be very fun to get 2.0 out on Independence Day
2011-07-04T05:01:56  <simonstewart> eranm: how goes the bug fixing?
2011-07-04T05:02:27  <AutomatedTester> woop, down to 3 failing tests
2011-07-04T05:03:04  <simonstewart> Excellent :)
2011-07-04T05:03:20  <AutomatedTester> actually down to 2 failing tests
2011-07-04T05:03:32  <AutomatedTester> is there a magic incantation for multiselects?
2011-07-04T05:03:51  <freynaud> simonstewart: config, failry easy , but blocking if it's done wrong. I would be good to have omething better than rc3 for grid
2011-07-04T05:04:13  <simonstewart> Agreed.
2011-07-04T05:04:17  <simonstewart> How long?
2011-07-04T05:04:24  <simonstewart> (guesstimate is fine)
2011-07-04T05:04:35  <freynaud> me ?
2011-07-04T05:05:07  <simonstewart> yeah
2011-07-04T05:06:53  <freynaud> today. It would be good to have Kevin look at the grid1 backward part too.
2011-07-04T05:07:02  <simonstewart> OK. Good to know
2011-07-04T05:07:08  * simonstewart thinks this is going to be a long day
2011-07-04T05:07:30  <freynaud> yep
2011-07-04T05:08:03  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: oh yes

2011-07-04T05:42:07  <jimevans> gah! now you've done it, simonstewart!
2011-07-04T05:42:12  <simonstewart> lol
2011-07-04T05:42:21  <adamgoucher> should we add something along the lines of 'before migrating from rc to webdriver, it helps to convert your scripts to page object' in that migration doc?
2011-07-04T05:42:40  <simonstewart> I think that's implicit in there already
2011-07-04T05:42:51  <simonstewart> Perhaps a comment that a well structured test codebase will make the migration easier
2011-07-04T05:43:01  <adamgoucher> implicit has no place in a migration doc :)
2011-07-04T05:43:41  <simonstewart> The point with the migration doc is that it allows team to pick the point where they invest effort
2011-07-04T05:44:01  <simonstewart> Saying to them "you also need to be writing in a coherent way too" isn't particularly helpful

2011-07-04T05:51:40  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-07-04T05:51:47  <simonstewart> right
2011-07-04T05:51:50  <jarib> simonstewart: did we decide something about the versioning?
2011-07-04T05:51:51  <simonstewart> eranm knows how to make it work
2011-07-04T05:51:57  <simonstewart> Ah! jarib is here
2011-07-04T05:52:05  <jarib> hey :)
2011-07-04T05:52:06  <simonstewart> Currently we're on "2.0"
2011-07-04T05:52:17  <simonstewart> as the svn revision is now encoded in exceptions
2011-07-04T05:52:31  <simonstewart> And that was a crucial piece of missing information
2011-07-04T05:52:41  <simonstewart> But I'm happy to discuss options
2011-07-04T05:52:42  <jarib> if you plan to do 2.0.X, that makes it hard to language-specific releases
2011-07-04T05:52:59  <jimevans> not for .NET. :P
2011-07-04T05:53:01  <simonstewart> what would you like?
2011-07-04T05:53:30  *** HolyGoat has quit IRC
2011-07-04T05:53:53  <eranm> jimevans, right - basically you have to compile with Gecko SDK 5
2011-07-04T05:53:55  <jarib> if there's a ruby-specific bug, i'd like to be able do patch releases without bothering you guys
2011-07-04T05:54:12  <eranm> I have a pending change to build multiple xpcom binaries, one for each Firefox version
2011-07-04T05:54:22  <simonstewart> ok. Won't that be bumping the rubygem version?
2011-07-04T05:54:22  <jarib> not that there's been a huge need for that lately, but it's nice to have the option
2011-07-04T05:54:52  <simonstewart> indeed.
2011-07-04T05:54:54  <simonstewart> ^^
2011-07-04T05:55:01  <samitbadle> jarib: I have a small patch relating to finding Firefox on some Win7 changes
2011-07-04T05:55:23  *** Freeaqingme has joined #selenium
2011-07-04T05:55:37  <jarib> simonstewart: yes, but i don't want to bump the gem to 2.0.1 and then have the rest of the project bump to 2.0.1 for a later revision
2011-07-04T05:56:08  <simonstewart> ok
2011-07-04T05:56:11  <simonstewart> so what would you like?
2011-07-04T05:56:24  <simonstewart> Independent version numbers per language?
2011-07-04T05:56:27  <jarib> if the project as a whole sticks to A.B, then we could do language-specific A.B.C
2011-07-04T05:56:35  <jarib> right. keep C language-specific
2011-07-04T05:56:44  <Freeaqingme> hi. I'm trying to export sometests I generated with selenium ide 1.0.12 to phpunit scripts, but when I go to file => export testuite as => php - phpunit, selenium tells me: "Suite export not implemented for the php-phpunit formatter". Any ideas how to get that working?
2011-07-04T05:56:52  <simonstewart> OK
2011-07-04T05:56:56  <jarib> at least that's one option.
2011-07-04T05:57:09  <simonstewart> But doesn't that just present the same problem, but with an additional number?
2011-07-04T05:58:03  <jarib> not if we agree on that as a convention
2011-07-04T05:58:12  <jarib> i'm open to other suggestions
2011-07-04T05:58:35  <simonstewart> Independent versioning per language?
2011-07-04T05:59:21  <jarib> that's a possibility
2011-07-04T05:59:40  <simonstewart> The opera and chrome drivers already have their own version numbers
2011-07-04T05:59:45  <jarib> just need to make it easy for people to know the correspondence to e.g. grid/remote for a given gem release
2011-07-04T05:59:55  <simonstewart> (though a bit of me hates that: makes it hard to tell whether or X should work with Y)
2011-07-04T06:00:59  <jarib> like i said, the need to do out-of-sync gem releases hasn't been huge
2011-07-04T06:01:00  <eranm> jimevans, what would be the best way to compile multiple dlls from the same source with different flags in visual studio?
2011-07-04T06:01:34  <AutomatedTester> woop, we have passing tests
2011-07-04T06:01:38  <jarib> and for critical language-specific bugs i could do pre-release gems (i.e. people would need to do `gem install selenium-webdriver --pre)
2011-07-04T06:01:40  <eranm> the quickest (dirtiest?) solution I can find is copy the webdriver-firefox.vcxproj to webdriver-firefox{4,5}.vcxproj and change the relevant flags (which gecko SDK to include)
2011-07-04T06:01:43  <AutomatedTester> my tests were out of step with the Java code
2011-07-04T06:02:17  <jarib> AutomatedTester, jimevans: how do you feel about this for python/.NET?
2011-07-04T06:02:25  <jarib> jimevans: why isn't it a problem in .NET?
2011-07-04T06:02:28  <simonstewart> I'm happy with whatever we do
2011-07-04T06:03:22  <jimevans> eranm: hmm. maybe create a new "platform" for the webdriver-firefox project?
2011-07-04T06:03:30  *** ian_mac_ has joined #selenium
2011-07-04T06:03:36  <jimevans> each platform can have its own settings.
2011-07-04T06:03:43  <AutomatedTester> i think that the client bindings should have a simple x matches y so if we keep 2.X.Y where x is the server version and y is the client version
2011-07-04T06:03:51  <AutomatedTester> then we can increment y all we want
2011-07-04T06:04:25  <simonstewart> (cos I live on HEAD)
2011-07-04T06:04:25  <simonstewart> (that came out wrong)
2011-07-04T06:04:26  <simonstewart> (jimevans: don't quote me)
2011-07-04T06:04:50  <AutomatedTester> *screenshots and tweets that*
2011-07-04T06:05:04  <jimevans> simonstewart: that's totally going on the air Friday night. :)
2011-07-04T06:05:53  <simonstewart> hah
2011-07-04T06:06:00  <jarib> simonstewart: so if we go for Y as the client version, for your post-2.0 schedule, how do you feel about doing 2.1, 2.2 etc instead of 2.0.1, 2.0.2?
2011-07-04T06:06:00  <jimevans> jarib: with .NET, we can do 4-part version numbering.
2011-07-04T06:06:02  <eranm> jimevans, where is the name of the output dll determined?
2011-07-04T06:06:13  <jarib> are everyone comfortable with 2.10, 2.11, ... eventually?
2011-07-04T06:06:16  <simonstewart> jarib: I'm fine with that
2011-07-04T06:06:26  <eranm> I can see I'll get the output in 'Platform/Release/webdriver-firefox.dll'
2011-07-04T06:06:33  <simonstewart> Or we could follow the lead of the browsers: 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on

2011-07-04T06:08:06  <simonstewart> yeah
2011-07-04T06:08:08  <davehunt> Versions need updating here too
2011-07-04T06:08:10  <simonstewart> I will
2011-07-04T06:08:15  <davehunt> Apparently this is what Grid is using
2011-07-04T06:08:18  <eranm> sure
2011-07-04T06:08:21  <davehunt> heh
2011-07-04T06:08:26  <jimevans> eranm: the output file name is determined by the "Output File" property in the properties dialog for Linker settings. This directly corresponds to the /output flag on the linker command line.
2011-07-04T06:08:34  <freynaud> davehunt:  more than apparently. I uses it :)

2011-07-04T06:09:07  <simonstewart> I suspect eranm is about to copy a lot of stuff into a lot of places :)
2011-07-04T06:10:31  <jimevans> I'm not entirely sure. We could bypass the use of MSBuild altogether and call the compiler and linker via the command line, but the VS build pieces in crazy-fun are nowhere near set up for that.
2011-07-04T06:10:37  <eranm> I haven't found a way to tweak it
2011-07-04T06:10:45  * simonstewart relaxes
2011-07-04T06:10:46  <eranm> (programatically, that is)
2011-07-04T06:12:18  <jimevans> Visual Studio will show you exactly what the command line parameters for cl.exe and link.exe will be, and maybe that's the way to go in the future.

2011-07-04T06:12:56  <simonstewart> yay!
2011-07-04T06:13:13  <pngl> Is there a succint way to ask for the absence of an element/of text? I'm experimenting with Webdriver before transitioning my Selenium 1 spec suite and it seems that element finding is conceptually very different from Selenium 1.
2011-07-04T06:14:30  <simonstewart> Not hugely different: not finding an element still throws an exception
2011-07-04T06:14:32  <eranm> Conveniently located in the Command Line menu item. That's handy, but I think that for now I'll copy configuration / project files. Making a crazyfun adapter will take a while.
2011-07-04T06:14:37  <jimevans> I think that, temporarily at least, creating different "platforms" in the Visual Studio solution is probably the way to go.
2011-07-04T06:15:28  <jimevans> Although, unlike with C# projects, a C++ project in VS points to the same source files, so you're right, adding a new .vcxproj is easier.
2011-07-04T06:15:59  <jimevans> (When you add a file to a .csproj, it gets copied to the project directory by default)
2011-07-04T06:16:10  <jimevans> right. bbiab.
2011-07-04T06:16:34  <pngl> eranm: yes, but the previous webdriver had convenience functions such as text_present and text_not_present. Catching an exception every single time would be tiresome.
2011-07-04T06:17:27  <pngl> eranm: although I see that find_elementS returns an empty array when no element was found.
2011-07-04T06:17:43  <pngl> eranm: I meant selenium-client, not "the previous webdriver" :)
2011-07-04T06:17:56  <simonstewart> Right
2011-07-04T06:18:12  <simonstewart> We've not included those support methods as they're so trivial to write
2011-07-04T06:18:16  <pngl> ..and all these messages were for simonstewart. Sorry.
2011-07-04T06:18:27  <simonstewart> On the plus side, we've added implicit waits
2011-07-04T06:18:37  <simonstewart> and made waiting for complex conditions cleaner
2011-07-04T06:18:53  <pngl> simonstewart: about complex conditions: how so?

2011-07-04T06:20:40  <jarib> pngl: as simon mentions, it's easy to write your own support methods for this. if you want a higher-level API, you could look at capybara or watir-webdriver

2011-07-04T06:25:02  <jarib> eranm: we should have some sort of bitness check when building the mozilla stuff
2011-07-04T06:25:30  <eranm> jarib, it only applies to Linux atm
2011-07-04T06:25:33  <jarib> eranm: a clean build on linux now downloads 32-bit SDKs even when the machine is 64-bit
2011-07-04T06:25:50  <simonstewart> hohoho
2011-07-04T06:26:07  <eranm> That's required because on linux you can cross-compile
2011-07-04T06:26:16  <jarib> aha
2011-07-04T06:26:27  <eranm> so you could then make a change to the binary component and compile only from one machine
2011-07-04T06:26:38  <eranm> two, actually, since you'd probably have to re-compile the Windows one as well
2011-07-04T06:27:04  <simonstewart> bollocks
2011-07-04T06:27:08  <jarib> would checking for that capability before downloading would be overkill?

2011-07-04T06:31:31  <jarib> no, this would be part of the download step, which only happens once
2011-07-04T06:31:40  <simonstewart> ok
2011-07-04T06:32:23  <eranm> jarib, I actually want a developer to get a compilation error if she's trying to re-compile the native components but don't have cross-compiler installed. It will decrease the chances of somebody changing the native events library and only checking in one prebuilt shared object without the other

2011-07-04T06:53:39  <simonstewart> lots of the discussion happens here
2011-07-04T06:53:46  <simonstewart> (on the irc channel)
2011-07-04T06:54:14  <simonstewart> One of the main problems is that people wait until launch day to raise issues
2011-07-04T06:54:28  <simonstewart> rc1 was waaaay late because of stuff like that
2011-07-04T06:54:40  <jarib> that's because all the changes come on launch day :)
2011-07-04T06:54:57  <simonstewart> I try and make changes on a continuous basis :)
2011-07-04T06:57:10  <AutomatedTester> if RC1 had been sooner I wouldnt have had to bisect 1200 commits
2011-07-04T06:57:21  <simonstewart> I know
2011-07-04T06:57:28  <simonstewart> I wasn't particularly happy with how long it took
2011-07-04T06:57:39  <ian_mac_> wait, issues should only be filed on launch day?
2011-07-04T06:57:42  <jimevans> I admit I'm overwhelmed by the large issue list.
2011-07-04T06:58:35  *** MadMerlin|work has quit IRC
2011-07-04T06:59:03  <barancev|2> actually, it is about 1/4 shorter - there are lots of duplicated and outdated issues on the list
2011-07-04T06:59:03  <simonstewart> Once we get to 2.0, I think we'll need a few releases with just bug fixes
2011-07-04T06:59:35  <AutomatedTester> a number of chrome ones can be closed with the next release
2011-07-04T06:59:44  *** MadMerlin|work has joined #selenium
2011-07-04T07:00:53  <jarib> i think it's overwhelming mostly because it's so hard to tell what issues are real bugs and which aren't
2011-07-04T07:01:08  <simonstewart> Another Bug Bash?
2011-07-04T07:01:25  <jarib> +1
2011-07-04T07:01:28  <AutomatedTester> +1
2011-07-04T07:01:31  <AutomatedTester> next week
2011-07-04T07:01:35  <simonstewart> Post 2.0
2011-07-04T07:01:40  <jarib> yep
2011-07-04T07:01:41  <simonstewart> For a week
2011-07-04T07:02:03  * jarib nods
2011-07-04T07:02:08  <ato> I'd love to help out in that

2011-07-04T07:02:53  <jarib> i never got around to writing that auto-close script
2011-07-04T07:03:54  <overlords> what language do you guys selenium in ?
2011-07-04T07:04:41  <selbot2> adam_goucher@hotmail.com half a minute ago - AdamGoucher - these get pushed as part of se-ide 1.0.12 but we'll get to the point where they are separately released so gotta keep the update files in order - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12735
2011-07-04T07:04:49  <jimevans> overlords: I think there's a verb missing there. Do you mean "write" or "use" selenium in?
2011-07-04T07:05:01  <overlords> hehe, write
2011-07-04T07:05:02  * jimevans is going to start using "Selenium" as a verb.
2011-07-04T07:05:39  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-07-04T07:05:50  <AutomatedTester> "haha, he just seleniumed all over his keyboard"
2011-07-04T07:06:17  <simonstewart> nasty
2011-07-04T07:06:27  <jimevans> overlords: If you mean the Selenium WebDriver API, that depends on the driver for each browser. The IE driver, for example, is written in C++.
2011-07-04T07:06:27  <overlords> am i the first person to use it as a verb??
2011-07-04T07:06:31  *** adamgoucher has joined #selenium
2011-07-04T07:06:47  <jimevans> The language bindings, of course, are written in the appropriate language.
2011-07-04T07:06:55  <simonstewart> "Profanity"
2011-07-04T07:06:57  <overlords> ah, so far i don't know the difference.
2011-07-04T07:07:11  <simonstewart> Profanity is pretty easy to spot
2011-07-04T07:07:14  *** MadMerlin|work_ has joined #selenium
2011-07-04T07:07:44  *** MadMerlin|work has quit IRC
2011-07-04T07:08:15  <jimevans> overlords: Why do you ask?
2011-07-04T07:08:55  <overlords> well, i've been using selenium ide to run some basic web testing - in html format
2011-07-04T07:08:56  <selbot> New news from builds: WEB-ADDON-13 was SUCCESSFUL : Updated by adam_goucher@hotmail.com <http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/WEB-ADDON-13>
2011-07-04T07:08:57  <ian_mac_> oh cool somebody wrote php webdriver bindings
2011-07-04T07:09:02  <ian_mac_> will have to try them out at some point
2011-07-04T07:09:06  <simonstewart> :)
2011-07-04T07:09:07  <overlords> but i've been seeing the functionality of the "macro" mode is quite lacking
2011-07-04T07:09:19  <overlords> for my purposes anyways
2011-07-04T07:09:19  <jimevans> Ah, Selenium IDE.
2011-07-04T07:09:31  <adamgoucher> the functionality of "se ide" is quite lacking
2011-07-04T07:09:32  <simonstewart> overlords: is there anyone near you who's programming that you can ask for help?
2011-07-04T07:09:34  <adamgoucher> (intentionally)
2011-07-04T07:09:35  <simonstewart> What do they use?
2011-07-04T07:09:56  <overlords> well, i can program.  i'm just wondering what the implementation is like
2011-07-04T07:10:40  <jimevans> Are we expecting a ChromeDriver.exe update soon-ish?
2011-07-04T07:10:47  <simonstewart> Java, C#, Ruby and Python are all good choices
2011-07-04T07:10:53  <simonstewart> jimevans: yes
2011-07-04T07:11:00  <simonstewart> I know the incantations to make one happen
2011-07-04T07:11:37  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: I had an email from someone, who we both know and based in Leicester, asking for Se-IDE help
2011-07-04T07:11:58  <simonstewart> Poor soul
2011-07-04T07:12:03  <simonstewart> What help does he need?
2011-07-04T07:12:16  <AutomatedTester> he wants to use Selenium in a new project
2011-07-04T07:12:29  *** andialbrecht is now known as andialbrecht_
2011-07-04T07:12:34  <AutomatedTester> so I rewrote one of his tests in python from the HTML format and sent back
2011-07-04T07:12:43  <AutomatedTester> with a good level of mocking too
2011-07-04T07:12:52  <simonstewart> There are some recorders coming out that support the webdriver api
2011-07-04T07:12:52  <jarib> simonstewart: the current chromedriver (from the chromium buildbot) crashes with a bus error when you call find_element for an element that doesn't exist
2011-07-04T07:12:52  <overlords> heh
2011-07-04T07:12:58  <jarib> (at least on os x)
2011-07-04T07:13:14  <simonstewart> jarib: I ran the full test suite yesterday without seeing a bus error
2011-07-04T07:13:43  <AutomatedTester> overlords: its not a reflection on you, its funny since this person is a phenomenal developer
2011-07-04T07:13:49  <jarib> simonstewart: with a build from http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/snapshots/Mac/ ?
2011-07-04T07:14:01  <simonstewart> Not with one of those builds
2011-07-04T07:14:09  <simonstewart> With the last downloadable one from google code
2011-07-04T07:14:13  * ato figured out why OperaDriver isn't working on Opera Mobile.
2011-07-04T07:14:14  <overlords> ah
2011-07-04T07:14:18  <ato> Talking to people helps.
2011-07-04T07:14:30  <AutomatedTester> ato: talking is overrated
2011-07-04T07:14:39  * adamgoucher is tempted to buy simonstewart http://etsy.me/lKoSg6 (in the context of incantations)
2011-07-04T07:14:48  <overlords> well, i'm all ears on how you guys implement your web tests
2011-07-04T07:15:14  <ato> AutomatedTester: Bad news is that it requires a change in the core, which is going to take some time.
2011-07-04T07:15:27  <simonstewart> adamgoucher: nice
2011-07-04T07:15:33  <AutomatedTester> overlords: at Mozilla we use the python code
2011-07-04T07:15:35  <simonstewart> overlords: I use Java
2011-07-04T07:15:51  <AutomatedTester> its up on Github if you want to see our tests
2011-07-04T07:15:59  <jarib> simonstewart: yeah, the current release works (minus click/setSelected and chrome 14, i believe)
2011-07-04T07:16:36  <simonstewart> ok
2011-07-04T07:16:45  <simonstewart> Alright.
2011-07-04T07:16:49  <simonstewart> Why did that fail?
2011-07-04T07:16:55  <AutomatedTester> ato: I am hoping to start looking into the Mobile Firefox version soonish
2011-07-04T07:16:56  <jimevans> overlords: at my workplace, we use C# and Java.
2011-07-04T07:17:12  <AutomatedTester> especially since we have hired a mobile platform engineer in London
2011-07-04T07:17:15  <overlords> ah okay
2011-07-04T07:17:18  <overlords> guess not many php'ers in here
2011-07-04T07:17:30  <simonstewart> Nope.
2011-07-04T07:17:34  <barancev|2> overlords: he-he :)
2011-07-04T07:17:36  <simonstewart> Not until Facebook adopt us :)
2011-07-04T07:17:49  <AutomatedTester> overlords: PHP isnt officially supported by the project
2011-07-04T07:18:03  <jarib> simonstewart: click/setSelected because atoms weren't updated on the chromium side, chrome 14 because of a v8 update that broke some atoms
2011-07-04T07:18:04  <simonstewart> Though there is a separate PHP driver out there
2011-07-04T07:18:16  <simonstewart> You know more than I do
2011-07-04T07:18:31  <ato> AutomatedTester: Essentially we have an option in Mobile that enables a native input keyboard (external input, i.e. for devices without screens, or where you pipe input from another program), and since we're using the Scope protocol, that seems to only work on the semi-native input we're currently using for regular Opera.
2011-07-04T07:18:32  <jarib> simonstewart: all this has been fixed in chromium trunk, but now it has a bus error
2011-07-04T07:18:48  <jarib> i do follow this project quite closely, yes :)
2011-07-04T07:19:12  <adamgoucher> overlords: phpunit comes with remote control bindings. though is very opinionated on how to structure scripts. the testing_selenium pear package has some enormous suckage bugs in it
2011-07-04T07:19:17  <wilhelm> overlords: Writing tests in the same language as your code isn't really neccessary, though. We test the Opera browser (C++) with a variety of different languages. Most relevant to this audience is Ruby (using Watir, which in turn uses WebDriver) and Java (WebDriver).
2011-07-04T07:20:08  <AutomatedTester> overlords: we use the same language as our devs but because its a nice language with low barrier for entry for contributors
2011-07-04T07:20:23  <ian_mac_> I just found http://code.google.com/p/php-webdriver-bindings/
2011-07-04T07:20:27  <ian_mac_> though I have tried it yet
2011-07-04T07:20:50  <adamgoucher> there is 3 or 4 php webdriver implementations
2011-07-04T07:20:52  <ian_mac_> s/have/have not/
2011-07-04T07:20:57  <ian_mac_> adamgoucher - oh?
2011-07-04T07:21:11  <jimevans> We do the same, so that our developers can run our tests with the least friction (not installing additional language runtimes, etc.)
2011-07-04T07:21:16  <overlords> ah, i see :)
2011-07-04T07:21:25  <overlords> i think your testing involves much more than what i aim to do, hehe
2011-07-04T07:21:32  <wilhelm> There's also a bunch of JavaScript, Perl, Python, shell scripts, Pike(!) and Bream(!) code used for testing here.
2011-07-04T07:21:43  <adamgoucher> ian_mac_: cooperation is not the geek prerogative :)
2011-07-04T07:22:00  * jimevans wishes the OperaDriver were implemented in C++
2011-07-04T07:22:25  <adamgoucher> has there been any movement on safari support in webdriver? and/or actually talking to apple?
2011-07-04T07:23:06  <ian_mac_> adamgoucher - sure, I just wasn't aware since I've been doing other things the last while
2011-07-04T07:23:06  <wilhelm> jimevans: That would have been nice, in hindsight. (c:

2011-07-04T07:24:16  <wilhelm> ato: Then we could have moved half the logic into the browser itself! :P
2011-07-04T07:24:20  <simonstewart> adamgoucher: still talking to apple. They're "kind of" busy right now
2011-07-04T07:24:26  <ato> jimevans: Can't you just do a remote webdriver to Java, like we do for selenium-webdriver in Ruby? (-;
2011-07-04T07:24:31  <jimevans> wilhelm: there's institutional resistance at some "purist" .NET shops to running Java exes.
2011-07-04T07:24:44  <simonstewart> ian_mac_: I'm not grouchy at you
2011-07-04T07:24:51  <jimevans> even though in reality, you can consider it "just another binary"
2011-07-04T07:24:54  <adamgroucher> ian_mac_: in general; not specifically you. though apparently simon is :)
2011-07-04T07:25:08  <simonstewart> eh? I just said I wasn't
2011-07-04T07:25:28  <adamgroucher> apparently i cant read
2011-07-04T07:25:32  <simonstewart> meh
2011-07-04T07:25:38  <adamgroucher> good thing i only need to write code today; not read
2011-07-04T07:26:09  <ian_mac_> hehe
2011-07-04T07:26:59  <jimevans> I should've had the "webdriver C++ wire protocol server" done sooner so that Opera could've taken advantage of it when creating OperaDriver. :)
2011-07-04T07:29:09  <ato> jimevans: We found the UmsProtos file, by the way.  Or stuartk said he did.
2011-07-04T07:29:19  <ato> jimevans: Strangely enough, it wasn't in the Opera Git repo (!).
2011-07-04T07:29:26  <jimevans> !
2011-07-04T07:29:50  <wilhelm> jimevans: I know the feeling. It's a cultural clash with my Unix background too. But it works! (c;

2011-07-04T07:33:51  <jimevans> i've heard of an issue, but haven't had time to track it down yet.
2011-07-04T07:34:02  <simonstewart> Something to do with the same domains stuff?
2011-07-04T07:34:07  <jimevans> It would be interesting to see if the flakiness flag fixes it.
2011-07-04T07:34:14  <simonstewart> Right
2011-07-04T07:34:36  <jimevans> Protected Mode doesn't exist in IE6, but it's possible the registry check is stupid.
2011-07-04T07:34:42  <simonstewart> heh
2011-07-04T07:34:54  <simonstewart> Do we bypass the check if we find we're using IE 6?
2011-07-04T07:34:56  <jimevans> The flakiness flag skips the check altogether.
2011-07-04T07:35:09  <simonstewart> right
2011-07-04T07:35:24  <jimevans> We're supposed to, but the version detection (for IE, or for Windows) might be effed.
2011-07-04T07:35:29  <simonstewart> heh
2011-07-04T07:35:49  <simonstewart> note to self: modifying the atoms really slows down testing with firefox
2011-07-04T07:35:51  <jimevans> That's my current working theory until I can spin up my IE6 environment.
2011-07-04T07:36:17  <simonstewart> How do you work with the virtual pcs
2011-07-04T07:36:56  <jimevans> I use Windows VPC for Windows 7. Have to update the images every 3-4 months (which sucks).
2011-07-04T07:36:58  <simonstewart> Mine appears to crap out if I try and install the integration features
2011-07-04T07:37:08  <jimevans> The XP image?
2011-07-04T07:37:11  <simonstewart> yes
2011-07-04T07:37:22  <simonstewart> It can't find usb.sys and usbhub.sys

2011-07-04T08:06:51  <odix> hmm, what kind of error do you think i could be getting? the server also starts on 0.0.0.0 to, i wonder if mny  /etc/hosts is screwed up

2011-07-04T08:13:42  <ian_mac_> so running the tests does start the browser?
2011-07-04T08:14:28  <odix> yes
2011-07-04T08:14:35  <odix> then nothing happens, where is the log file, sorry

2011-07-04T08:26:14  <jimevans> I thought we needed a different version of the SDK to get native events with FF5.

2011-07-04T08:34:05  <Mayank> I dont think so, the element is way before, right after the page loads (it is not clickable then) but it should not throw a not found exception?
2011-07-04T08:34:06  <Mayank> Ill try implicit wait, but i dont think that will work

2011-07-04T08:35:47  <eranm> barancev|2, unless you're on Linux, in which case you should build from trunk
2011-07-04T08:36:16  <jimevans> Mayank: Also, what barancev|2 said about frames. Is the page part of a frame or iframe?
2011-07-04T08:36:20  <barancev|2> eranm: I'm on win7 x64, but I build from source
2011-07-04T08:36:35  <jimevans> barancev|2: the change hasn't landed for windows yet.
2011-07-04T08:37:01  <pngl> I'm having issues with Webdriver and iframes. Formerly, with selenium-client, I looked for an element regardless of its parent (parent frame or iframe), and it would just work. With Webdriver I tried switching to the iframe, then looking for the element, but I always get NoSuchElement errors.

2011-07-04T08:51:50  <simonstewart> OK. I think that my issue boils down to the reference to the element not always being consistent
2011-07-04T08:52:09  <jarib> samitbadle: works on my Win7 VM - do you have FF in a non-standard location?
2011-07-04T08:52:37  <samitbadle> jarib: Its in the std location, but there is no registry entry.
2011-07-04T08:53:12  <samitbadle> the problem is that under Win 7, Fx is in Program files x86 folder since it is 32 bit

2011-07-04T09:13:00  <AutomatedTester> DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX['platform'] = x
2011-07-04T09:13:16  <davehunt> AutomatedTester: but starting a grid node...?
2011-07-04T09:13:58  <jimevans> try as I might, I can't see how #1979 is a Selenium issue, at least not as reported.

2011-07-04T09:15:20  <AutomatedTester> davehunt: starting a node? that would be done with grid then, not the client code?

2011-07-04T09:15:35  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: that issue is an automatic, upgrade and try again
2011-07-04T09:15:52  <davehunt> AutomatedTester: yes, so my initial question was a little misleading
2011-07-04T09:16:19  <davehunt> Specifically with grid and remote driver, how can I do it?
2011-07-04T09:17:07  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: agreed, but even so, it's straight JavaScript execution.

2011-07-04T09:20:00  <eranm> I used to get annoyed, waiting for the cpp compiler to build my projects. Now that seems like the quickest part in our build.
2011-07-04T09:20:22  <samitbadle> Its probably terrible code and I still need to complete the tests, but would love to know what you think.
2011-07-04T09:20:45  <AutomatedTester> davehunt: looks like I *may* be missing a method to return the capabilities from the driver

2011-07-04T09:24:35  <simonstewart> Conforming to standards of a platform is a smart thing to do
2011-07-04T09:24:44  <jimevans> Since the code in Selenium.Core is no longer autogenerated...
2011-07-04T09:25:12  <samitbadle> simonstewart: I am going to paste a link to converted code of a random handful of Se1 commands in no particular order
2011-07-04T09:25:13  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: from davehunt's question, how would you specify platform version?
2011-07-04T09:25:34  <simonstewart> Other than via the DesiredCapabilities?
2011-07-04T09:25:41  <simonstewart> And not using grid?
2011-07-04T09:25:45  <simonstewart> Or with grid in the middle?
2011-07-04T09:26:02  <AutomatedTester> for use in grid, with DesiredCapabilities,
2011-07-04T09:26:13  <simonstewart> freynaud can better answer that than me

2011-07-04T09:26:54  <freynaud> AutomatedTester: what's the question ?
2011-07-04T09:27:07  <AutomatedTester> freynaud: how to chose a platform based on version
2011-07-04T09:27:10  <AutomatedTester> on grid
2011-07-04T09:27:27  <simonstewart> samitbadle: FindElement will throw an exception if the element isn't present
2011-07-04T09:27:28  <jimevans> 2.1 feature request: ability to switch native events off at runtime (requires wire protocol addition).
2011-07-04T09:27:32  <AutomatedTester> atm, DesiredCapabilities platform has MAC, LINUX, WINDOWS
2011-07-04T09:27:38  <freynaud> by default it checks if Platform.is(requested); , so no version
2011-07-04T09:27:44  <simonstewart> assertElementPresent == findElement
2011-07-04T09:28:09  * jimevans is really tired of having to explain that WebDriver is very much at the mercy of IE with native events
2011-07-04T09:28:16  <freynaud> to have more info taken into account, you can change the capability matcher
2011-07-04T09:28:49  <freynaud> the interface has 1 method, it takes a requested capability, and check every node for a match
2011-07-04T09:28:50  <davehunt> freynaud: so it'll be a future enhancement
2011-07-04T09:29:05  <simonstewart> Disabled checks can be abbreviated with element.isEnabled()
2011-07-04T09:29:06  <freynaud> it should work already

2011-07-04T09:31:00  <davehunt> freynaud: we might want to make this standard -- it's something Grid 1 can do via the environments string
2011-07-04T09:31:11  <simonstewart> And typically fields are private
2011-07-04T09:31:37  <freynaud> davehunt:  if you're using a grid1 node, it should do an exact match on envt

2011-07-04T09:42:49  <simonstewart> How do I check?
2011-07-04T09:43:19  <jimevans> You'll have to set the protected mode for the zones.

2011-07-04T10:42:48  <jarib> i know :)
2011-07-04T10:42:51  <jarib> just kidding
2011-07-04T10:42:51  <simonstewart> :)
2011-07-04T10:43:52  <ato> jarib: I talked to a guy in NRK that was interested in using it as well.
2011-07-04T10:43:56  <ato> Can't remember his name, though.
2011-07-04T10:45:40  <jarib> cool, trygve lie maybe?

2011-07-04T10:46:11  <simonstewart> Switching it on by default broken a bunch of tests in google
2011-07-04T10:46:15  <simonstewart> So we backed it out
2011-07-04T10:46:30  <simonstewart> Those teams have now had plenty of time to move to webdriver
2011-07-04T10:46:39  <simonstewart> So we can now make it the default again
2011-07-04T10:46:50  <dawagner> We have #1437 to re-instate it...

2011-07-04T10:47:53  <Mayank1> Hi, is there any other way I can swtich to an iframe apart from - driver.switchTo().frame(0) or driver.switchTo.frame(id) or selenium.selectFrame('id');
2011-07-04T10:48:05  <jarib> you can pass a WebElement
2011-07-04T10:48:06  <simonstewart> Yes: switchTo().frame(element)
2011-07-04T10:49:19  <Mayank1> simonstewart, jarib: any why would the above to fail when the DOM already has an iframe
2011-07-04T10:49:41  <simonstewart> I need a little more information....
2011-07-04T10:50:27  <Mayank1> Ill just paste the  DOM and the code, give me a second.
2011-07-04T10:50:28  *** samit has joined #selenium
2011-07-04T10:50:34  <jarib> Mayank1: if it fails, then there's probably no iframe at the time you're looking
2011-07-04T10:51:05  <jimevans> Dammit! I can't manage to get the JVM to crash.

2011-07-04T10:53:57  <simonstewart> right
2011-07-04T10:54:07  <simonstewart> You need the IE driver to fail to load because of the protected domains issue
2011-07-04T10:54:08  <jimevans> yeah, i did that. I'm properly getting an exception.
2011-07-04T10:54:13  <simonstewart> Good.
2011-07-04T10:54:28  <simonstewart> Next you need to run the emulated test suite with no modifications
2011-07-04T10:55:04  <jimevans> Ok. let me try that then.
2011-07-04T10:56:13  <Mayank1> simonstewart, jarib: here is DOM the only interesting line is 1.3 - the http://pastebin.com/UC5yQDD4. The code I am using is  http://pastebin.com/Uu1Hw1kY and the exception here - http://pastebin.com/gMHncW5b

2011-07-04T10:59:18  <simonstewart> !element.isDisplayed()
2011-07-04T10:59:30  <Mayank1> simonstewart: nothing at all.
2011-07-04T10:59:41  <ner0x> simonstewart: Perl binding version?
2011-07-04T10:59:51  <simonstewart> hang on. You're using the perl binding
2011-07-04T10:59:52  <ner0x> I have a "is_visible( locator )";
2011-07-04T11:00:40  <AutomatedTester> is_visible is Se1 API
2011-07-04T11:01:10  <AutomatedTester> ner0x: so is_visible would return false if not visible
2011-07-04T11:01:20  * ner0x tries it out.

2011-07-04T11:33:46  <adamgoucher> so py.test lets plugins modify the commandline arguments. but yet, when you call pytest.main() per the documentation the plugins= option is parsed /after/ the are-the-arguments-valid check

2011-07-04T11:51:40  <simonstewart> The TestClickAt is highlighting some issues the are pretty deep
2011-07-04T11:51:45  <jimevans> simonstewart: I don't think so either.
2011-07-04T11:51:54  <simonstewart> Damn
2011-07-04T11:52:01  <jimevans> I've gotten the crash, but can't seem to attach a debugger in a meaningful way.
2011-07-04T11:52:03  <simonstewart> Oh well. At least we're a lot closer than before
2011-07-04T11:52:11  <simonstewart> Yeah. It's tricky
2011-07-04T11:52:17  *** towski has quit IRC
2011-07-04T11:52:19  <jimevans> Any ideas
2011-07-04T11:53:07  <simonstewart> The interesting thing is that it's caused by the TestCommandError
2011-07-04T11:53:15  <simonstewart> Whatever the next test is is the one that fails
2011-07-04T11:53:52  <jimevans> Hang on a tick
2011-07-04T11:54:22  <jimevans> it doesn't look to me like any tests are being run.
2011-07-04T11:55:04  <simonstewart> It won;t
2011-07-04T11:55:09  <simonstewart> the browser won't start
2011-07-04T11:55:15  <jimevans> right, as it shouldn't
2011-07-04T11:55:16  <simonstewart> So it'll just look like it's hanging
2011-07-04T11:55:23  <simonstewart> But it'll fail eventually
2011-07-04T11:55:41  <jimevans> oh, wait, right. I'm getting multiple iedriver.dll extractions into the temp folder. that explains why that's happening.
2011-07-04T11:55:54  <simonstewart> Eh?
2011-07-04T11:56:23  <jimevans> The driver fails to load, so the next test must try to re-extract the iedriver.dll to the temp folder.
2011-07-04T11:56:32  <simonstewart> Ohhh... fun
2011-07-04T11:56:33  <jimevans> then that one fails, so it does it again.
2011-07-04T11:56:45  <simonstewart> OK. But why is that causing the jvm to crash?
2011-07-04T11:57:01  <jimevans> oh, it's not. it's just the evidence that other tests are attempting to run.
2011-07-04T11:57:13  <simonstewart> Oh right
2011-07-04T11:57:16  <simonstewart> ok
2011-07-04T11:57:21  <jimevans> because there's nothing in the log.
2011-07-04T11:57:54  <jimevans> How can I attach the VS debugger to the java.exe process?
2011-07-04T11:58:15  <simonstewart> It gets a little tricky
2011-07-04T11:58:23  <simonstewart> Basically, stick a breakpoint in the java code
2011-07-04T11:58:37  <simonstewart> then attach to the java process in VS debugger when you hit that
2011-07-04T11:58:46  <simonstewart> Then let the Java code continue
2011-07-04T11:58:54  <simonstewart> and hit a break point set in the VS debugger
2011-07-04T11:58:58  <simonstewart> Easy, right?
2011-07-04T11:58:59  <jimevans> bleh.
2011-07-04T11:59:09  <simonstewart> Yes. That's how I feel about it
2011-07-04T11:59:16  <simonstewart> Just doing my status emails at work
2011-07-04T11:59:23  <simonstewart> Then I'll throw in something to the java.rb to help
2011-07-04T11:59:44  <jimevans> Is there a way to have the java bindings load the native code from disk rather than extract to the temp folder?
2011-07-04T12:00:23  <simonstewart> You can force them into debug mode
2011-07-04T12:00:41  <jimevans> from the command line that would be... ?
2011-07-04T12:00:51  <simonstewart> Just hunting
2011-07-04T12:00:56  <jimevans> ah.
2011-07-04T12:01:12  <simonstewart> OK. You need to make sure that the IEDriver.DLL isn't in the jar file
2011-07-04T12:01:19  <simonstewart> (rename it in the build.desc?)
2011-07-04T12:01:31  <simonstewart> The set the system property "webdriver.development"
2011-07-04T12:01:52  <simonstewart> And make the IEDriver you want to use available in build/cpp/$ARCH/Debug
2011-07-04T12:01:57  <jimevans> ah, so you check the jar for it first, then look on disk.
2011-07-04T12:02:02  <simonstewart> right
2011-07-04T12:02:12  <simonstewart> but we only check the disk if you've set a system property
2011-07-04T12:02:19  <jimevans> the .NET bindings look to disk first, then in the assembly resources.
2011-07-04T12:02:29  <simonstewart> I don't trust the users
2011-07-04T12:02:38  <jimevans> I don't blame you there.
2011-07-04T12:03:06  <jimevans> But after all of the hassle we had when the .NET bindings didn't embed the native code dll, I worry less about it. :)

2011-07-04T12:06:41  <jimevans> thanks
2011-07-04T12:07:00  <jimevans> that, I can do in the build.desc.

2011-07-04T12:09:13  <jimevans> i'll give that a shot. should be able to remove the resources from //java/client/o/o/selenium/ie/build.desc too
2011-07-04T12:09:26  <simonstewart> Or you can just rename them
2011-07-04T12:12:28  <jimevans> will it crash if I *just* run TestCommandError followed by TestComments?
2011-07-04T12:15:28  <simonstewart> Well, shoot. I was the one who removed the xpcnativewrappers
2011-07-04T12:15:35  <simonstewart> jimevans: yes

2011-07-04T12:28:50  <jarib> i think it would make sense for the template to have some simple helpers
2011-07-04T12:29:26  <jarib> i'll just hack away and we'll see
2011-07-04T12:29:31  <samit> jarib: indeed!
2011-07-04T12:30:07  <samit> jarib: btw, the test just a random mix of commands, probably will not run
2011-07-04T12:30:15  <jarib> yep
2011-07-04T12:30:48  <jarib> in most cases you'll need to switch the expected and actual value
2011-07-04T12:30:58  <jarib> e.g. when you do:     ("9").should != @driver.all(:css, "input").size
2011-07-04T12:31:14  <jarib> that should be: @driver.all(:css, "input").size.should != 9
2011-07-04T12:31:31  <jarib> otherwise the assertion messages will be very strange
2011-07-04T12:31:40  <samit> jarib: thats what I thought, but the existing rspec formatter does this and I just reuse it
2011-07-04T12:31:52  <jarib> ah, ok
2011-07-04T12:32:01  <jarib> can you gist the output of the existing formatter?

2011-07-04T12:33:49  <samit> jarib: I did. but that is a problem with the IDE not being able to know that the type is numeric
2011-07-04T12:34:07  <jarib> ah, i see the old formatter does this as well
2011-07-04T12:34:10  <samit> no. all it does is find the element
2011-07-04T12:34:27  <jarib> so it's not expected to actually work out of the box
2011-07-04T12:34:37  <samit> thats kind of sad

2011-07-04T12:44:50  <jarib> webdriver has close() and quit() for that
2011-07-04T12:44:57  <samit> just close the current window
2011-07-04T12:45:44  <jarib> ok
2011-07-04T12:46:36  <jarib> also, in the regexps, i can't imageine [\s\S] being different from just .
2011-07-04T12:51:03  <mashiara> ref regex: apart from being hugely inefficient way to say it.
2011-07-04T12:52:49  <samit> that is specifically to implement the se1 glob: pattern matching
2011-07-04T12:54:10  <samit> jarib: I think I just fixed the "9" bug in IDE. should fix it for all formatters
2011-07-04T12:54:46  * samit goes to test his theory

2011-07-04T12:57:51  <jarib> samit: this is more or less what it would look like if i wrote it by hand
2011-07-04T12:57:52  <jarib> samit: https://gist.github.com/1063829
2011-07-04T12:58:12  <jarib> most of the API examples elsewhere use find_element/find_elements over the first/all sugar, so i went with that
2011-07-04T12:58:37  <jarib> ditto for Element#attribute over Element#[]
2011-07-04T12:59:05  * samit stares in awe at the code
2011-07-04T12:59:17  <jarib> haha
2011-07-04T12:59:41  <samit> jarib: thank you!!!! This is just great!
2011-07-04T12:59:49  <barancev|2> does 'go debug-server' have pages for api1.0 tests?
2011-07-04T13:00:03  <samit> I just changed the find_element and attribute to first/all/[]
2011-07-04T13:00:27  <barancev|2> where are they located?
2011-07-04T13:00:37  <samit> jarib: though it would be more the ruby way, but would change it back
2011-07-04T13:01:53  <jarib> i can see why you'd think that :)
2011-07-04T13:02:03  <jarib> i do prefer the long version for examples though

2011-07-04T13:12:02  <barancev|2> TestBasicAuth failed for IE9 - the browser just does not allow http://alice:foo@localhost/ freaking addess
2011-07-04T13:13:12  <barancev|2> you can't cheat the browser with the password it the addressbar
2011-07-04T13:14:21  <samit> jarib: I agree that the long version is more consistent with api for other languages as well

2011-07-04T13:42:18  <barancev|2> all the "invisible" texts give true in responce to isTextPresent
2011-07-04T13:43:21  <barancev|2> IE90 seems to be a problem for SeRC

2011-07-04T13:49:44  <barancev|2> com.thoughtworks.selenium.corebased.TestGetTextContent
2011-07-04T13:49:51  <samit> jarib: a quick Q: sometimes there is a () before the .should and sometimes not. What is the reason behind this.
2011-07-04T13:49:52  <barancev|2> it is API 1.0 test
2011-07-04T13:51:18  <jarib> samit: presumably to work around some presedence issue, but i couldn't see any place that required it when i made changes
2011-07-04T13:51:49  <samit> is it ok to always include the () before the .should?
2011-07-04T13:51:59  <barancev|2> Chrome have the same problem with invilible texts, it can't pass TestGetTextContent
2011-07-04T13:52:35  <barancev|2> let me check opera

2011-07-04T14:00:34  <jarib> samit: it doesn't prevent it from working, it's just not as aesthetically pleasing since it's not necessary
2011-07-04T14:00:43  <jarib> so if it make things easier for you, sure
2011-07-04T14:01:05  <samit> jarib: or I need a way to determine when it is necessary
2011-07-04T14:01:26  <samit> jarib: but we can optimise it later
2011-07-04T14:03:38  <samit> jarib: one last Q for today: can I always a ".boolean?.should be_true" with a ".should be_boolean"
2011-07-04T14:04:04  <jarib> yes
2011-07-04T14:04:11  <samit> Excellent!
2011-07-04T14:04:17  <samit> Thanks a lot jarib
2011-07-04T14:04:21  <jarib> np
2011-07-04T14:04:32  <jarib> thanks to you too! :)
2011-07-04T14:04:41  <barancev|2> opera passed TestGetTextContent!
2011-07-04T14:04:42  <samit> Now I go and put my brain cells to work on the complex try catch proble,
2011-07-04T14:05:11  <barancev|2> to my surprise, as it failed many other ones: Tests run: 79, Failures: 5, Errors: 41
2011-07-04T14:06:00  <barancev|2> is it possible to specify different log names for different browser in build.desc ?
2011-07-04T14:07:16  <barancev|2> atm I can't run tests for all browsers at once - the next browser overwrites the log file of the previous browser as they all run the same test suite
