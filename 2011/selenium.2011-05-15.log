2011-05-15T14:01:39  <lisak> hey, I was using version 1.0.1 of selenium-server.jar and the java-client ....can I just use this selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar  and selenium-java-2.0b3.jar   the way I was using it ?
2011-05-15T14:01:48  <lisak> before
2011-05-15T14:04:34  <lisak> I don't get the history, it is still in beta version, but I see a year old blog posts like this one http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/07/30/how-to-use-selenium-2-with-maven/
2011-05-15T14:07:17  <BiMech> @lisak the 2.0b3 standalone-server will respond to calls made from a selenium 1 (non-webdriver) client library.
2011-05-15T14:13:46  <BiMech> Question regarding getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE) in 2.0b3: I am using Augmenter on a RemoteWebDriver instance to enable screenshots to be taken. It seems to take the screenshots (and save them to my local system), but the image file is corrupt and will not open.
2011-05-15T14:15:49  <lisak> BiMech, and what would you recommend for a java developer starting a project ? I'm a Liferay developer and liferay is still using selenium 1, I guess that the reason is due to existing selenium 1 tests .... I don;t get the webdriver + selenium integration much
2011-05-15T14:19:50  <BiMech> @lisak from what I've gathered, most new development is being directed towards selenium 2, while selenium 1 is transitioning more towards maintenance mode. WebDriver offers a more robust api, as it's not bound by the limitations of javascript in the browser. Selenium 2 still offers some backward compatibility with Selenium 1 ( http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html#emulating-selenium-rc ), but the emphasis going forward will be o
2011-05-15T14:19:50  <BiMech> WebDriver api.
