2011-09-11T02:52:36  <matley> My AUT has an iframe which is printed (frames['myiframe'].print()). Though I overwrote frames['myiframe'].print() = function(){}, I am observing a strange behavior as selenium "sometimes" loose the window/frame focus (I guess) and the test fails for timeout of a waitForElementPresent cmd. Is it a known issue?

My app has a lot of funny things that may be involved in my issue (cache manifest, ExtJS, iframes with cross domain content, printing, javascript with lazy loading). Furthermore, the problem occurs only once every 5 test run on average.

2011-09-11T10:37:16  <AJay> what do you want to Comment ?
2011-09-11T10:38:03  <AutomatedTester> a team member has created a new project and asked me to review
2011-09-11T10:38:27  <AutomatedTester> so I cheated and just forked it with the changes I suggested
2011-09-11T10:38:34  <AutomatedTester> he can then cherry pick what he wants
2011-09-11T10:38:40  <AutomatedTester> was so much quicker to do that
2011-09-11T10:38:42  <AJay> Cool ,
2011-09-11T10:39:47  <AJay> you are in mv ?
2011-09-11T10:39:47  <AutomatedTester> AJay: do you know if I do java -jar opera-driver.jar should it do anything?

2011-09-11T10:42:26  <AJay> selenium standalone is enough
2011-09-11T10:42:50  <AJay> opera driver is a part of selenium jars
2011-09-11T10:43:38  <AutomatedTester> oh, I thought the opera driver could be run like chromedriver, firefoxdriver, IE driver that you didnt need the selenium standalone
2011-09-11T10:44:08  <AJay> it runs like a Other drivers
2011-09-11T10:44:46  * AutomatedTester thought he could do a python driver but looks like I cant
2011-09-11T10:45:02  <AutomatedTester> jarib's ruby version must only be for JRuby then
2011-09-11T10:45:14  <AutomatedTester> thats a shame, I will raise this with ato
2011-09-11T10:45:59  <AutomatedTester> since .NET and python wont work like other drivers unless it goes through the Selenium Server
2011-09-11T10:46:21  <AJay> AutomatedTester: you dont need standalone server to be started
2011-09-11T10:46:36  <AutomatedTester> so what do I start then?
2011-09-11T10:46:41  <AutomatedTester> I must need to start something
2011-09-11T10:47:17  <AJay> WebDriver wd = new  OperaDriver()
2011-09-11T10:47:43  <AutomatedTester> ok so I am trying to create the python version of OperaDriver()
2011-09-11T10:47:58  <AJay> Cool
2011-09-11T10:48:20  <AutomatedTester> so I need to start something so i can hook into Opera
2011-09-11T10:48:35  <AutomatedTester> for chrome I start the chromedriver executable
2011-09-11T10:48:49  <AutomatedTester> and then speak to that to get chrome to do what I want
2011-09-11T10:48:58  <AutomatedTester> so what do I start for Opera
2011-09-11T10:49:31  <AJay> i got it
2011-09-11T10:49:35  <AJay> there is a launcher

2011-09-11T11:48:25  <jarib_> not specific to opera
2011-09-11T11:48:56  <AutomatedTester> oh :/
2011-09-11T11:48:59  <AutomatedTester> thats a shame
2011-09-11T11:49:09  <jarib_> the operadriver is written in java, so basically their remote server is THE remote server
2011-09-11T11:49:40  <AutomatedTester> i know... but the remote server is a lot more bloated
2011-09-11T11:49:45  <AutomatedTester> oh well
2011-09-11T11:50:55  <jarib_> they could always do a opera-specific build if the download size annoys their users
2011-09-11T11:51:08  <jarib_> still, java is needed somewhere
2011-09-11T11:51:53  * AutomatedTester wonders if he could do the protobuf stuff

2011-09-11T12:00:59  <jarib> conceptually, the only difference is that chromedriver is written in c++ and operadriver in java
