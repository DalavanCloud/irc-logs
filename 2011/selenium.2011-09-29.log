2011-09-29T02:31:03  <steve9000> But that shouldn't stop the url from loading
2011-09-29T02:31:37  <jarib> ok, so the driver.get call returns
2011-09-29T02:31:40  <jarib> ?
2011-09-29T02:32:28  <jarib> do you see firefox trying to load the page at all? what happens if you try to load a URL manually in a webdriver-launched firefox window?
2011-09-29T02:32:37  <steve9000> If I change it to print(driver.get("http://www.google.com")), I get None
2011-09-29T02:33:07  <steve9000> There seems to be no attempt to load, but manual URLs are fine
2011-09-29T02:35:18  <Stuk> Ajay1: thanks, I'll have a look at it in a bit :)
2011-09-29T02:35:24  <steve9000> type(driver) returns: class 'selenium.webdriver.firefox.webdriver.WebDriver'
2011-09-29T02:35:50  <jarib> steve9000: the return value of get() probably isn't significant
2011-09-29T02:36:02  <steve9000> nod
2011-09-29T02:36:09  <jarib> steve9000: it sounds very odd that it wouldn't even attempt to load it
2011-09-29T02:36:49  <jarib> do other calls work before .get()? e.g. getCurrentUrl (or the pyton equiv.)

2011-09-29T02:56:54  <steve9000> In this case, I get a blank print() line, and the blank WebDriver firefox instance, no attempt to load anything.
2011-09-29T02:57:36  <steve9000> I bet it's some silly Windows permission thing.

2011-09-29T07:46:43  <RossPatterson> use "click" instead of "clickAndWait", because the page where you

2011-09-29T08:06:22  <RossPatterson> We use these tests as canaries in the coal mine - ant failing test is important.  This week so far, two developers checked in code that broke tests, in both cases we got the bug back in dev's hands BEFORE they gave the work product to QA to test.

2011-09-29T08:10:03  <RossPatterson> chson: (continuing the above) Our intent is that a test never fails unless there is a bug.  That's hard to do, but it can be done.

2011-09-29T08:11:06  <RossPatterson> chson: Of course, sometimes the "bug" is that Development changed a function, and the test needs to be updated.  But that's still a bug, just one in our change process, rather than one in our code :-)

2011-09-29T08:12:30  <smax> I see storeSelectOptions returns an array, does selenium support traversing arrays?
2011-09-29T08:12:39  <smax> is this selenium array or a javascript array
2011-09-29T08:13:14  <RossPatterson> I'm not sure what IDE will let you do with that, sorry.
2011-09-29T08:20:21  <chson> RossPatterson: that's pretty impressive.  i'm part of the school that is guilty of dismissing some failures when I know that code works and the tests need updating.
2011-09-29T08:21:35  <RossPatterson> chson: That's why our tests are written and mantained in QA instead of in Development :-)  Having a bit of a wall between code-under-test and testing-code helps us ensure the tests stay green.

2011-09-29T08:50:23  <Nogem> That's hybrid Waterfall Agile, and the varying degrees I've seen companies implement range from extremely productive to terrifying and slow
2011-09-29T08:51:31  *** stockton has joined #selenium
2011-09-29T08:51:34  <chson> ultimately big co is not ready for lean/agile/whatever because the middle managers wouldn't have much to report to the execs
2011-09-29T08:51:39  <RossPatterson> I try not to get into software process model arguments, but I do believe that most (even waterfall) have places where they work well and places where they fail horribly.
2011-09-29T08:52:06  <RossPatterson> chson: Or, conversely, because management doesn't want the geeks driving the company.
2011-09-29T08:52:06  <nirvdrum> RossPatterson: Except agile.  Agile always works.
2011-09-29T08:52:20  <adamgoucher> absolutely -- and there is lots of money for people like me to come in and help pick up the pieces! :D
2011-09-29T08:52:22  <Nogem> No it doesn't.
2011-09-29T08:52:45  <nirvdrum> Nogem: Agile is like Communism.  When it fails, you just weren't practicing real agile!
2011-09-29T08:52:53  <RossPatterson> EXACTLY!!!
2011-09-29T08:53:18  <lukeis> it's called fragile when it's not agile ;)
2011-09-29T08:53:59  <adamgoucher> scrumerfall is one of my favs
2011-09-29T08:54:17  <RossPatterson> I like Scrumbut.  "We're doing Scrum, but ..."
2011-09-29T08:54:54  <Nogem> I've worked in a place where the was waterfall (admittedly rough on it, but still). The system was a distributed integration of multiple complex systems into a giant and extremely complex system. Agile managers were brought in, walls were covered in post its, methods were adhered to religiously - things went downhill quickly
2011-09-29T08:56:12  <adamgoucher> 'religiously' is the most important part of that sentance.
2011-09-29T08:56:54  <Dude-X> agile works pretty good here, for the most part.
2011-09-29T08:57:45  <Nogem> We went from predictably late deploying to constantly deploying poorly documented, mainly ineffectual, changes with no time to breathe. Within 2 years the system became all but unsupportable and the customer base reflected it. Worse, we actually became slower to get meaningful features and fixes to production. It was an embarrassing nightmare I'd rather not repeat. That said Agile actually is my preference in most scenarios.
2011-09-29T08:58:49  <RossPatterson> I've seen that happen often.  I've never seen an agile style work well except in a small operation with a small product/service.
2011-09-29T08:58:49  <Nogem> Just don't mistake it for a silver bullet. It doesn't kill all things evil.

2011-09-29T11:37:41  <barancev> but if I did it in a single commit, it would be hard to write a comment

2011-09-29T11:41:38  <barancev> actually, the code was broken, but tests could not detect that because it was broken in two places that compensate each other :)
2011-09-29T11:42:23  <Ajay1> barancev: i would have written the failing test
2011-09-29T11:42:39  <Ajay1> and then checked in the code to pass them

2011-09-29T11:54:44  <barancev> usually I consider tests as landmarks that show what's to be done. so it's ok if some of they are broken. al least I know what to do

2011-09-29T14:53:02  <lukeis> algard: firebug runs from the parent frame already... if you're executing that in a frame that's been switched to a few times, you might want "window.top.mainFrame.location='blah';" but what's the error you're getting?
2011-09-29T14:53:55  <algard> the problem was that there was no error, and no effect
2011-09-29T14:54:12  <algard> i just found the problem actually - needed to switch back to the defaultContext before running the JS
2011-09-29T14:54:23  <algard> didn't know it mattered :)
2011-09-29T14:55:33  <algard> i bet your window.top.mainFrame would have worked too

2011-09-29T16:05:55  <simonstewart> Loving being back in Sydney
2011-09-29T16:06:10  <simonstewart> What've I missed over the past few days?
2011-09-29T16:06:30  <jarib> i've been working a bit on CI
2011-09-29T16:06:40  <simonstewart> So I noticed
2011-09-29T16:06:43  <simonstewart> How's it going?
2011-09-29T16:07:01  <jarib> pretty good
2011-09-29T16:07:05  <jarib> the xserve needs some RAM replaced
2011-09-29T16:07:12  <jarib> it keeps kernel panicing
2011-09-29T16:07:18  <jarib> so that's a bit annoying
2011-09-29T16:07:30  *** cgp_ has quit IRC
2011-09-29T16:07:53  <simonstewart> Crap. That's sub-optimal
2011-09-29T16:08:06  <jarib> though i'm not entirely sure that's the reason, there are parity errors in the logs from 2009..
2011-09-29T16:08:26  <simonstewart> *sigh*
2011-09-29T16:08:27  <jarib> so it could be the virtualbox kext that's causing it..
2011-09-29T16:08:32  *** Fyrespray has quit IRC
2011-09-29T16:08:43  <jarib> but the vagrant stuff is super nice
2011-09-29T16:09:05  <simonstewart> So I hear
2011-09-29T16:09:15  <jarib> having puppet-configured, clean VMs for each build would help a lot
2011-09-29T16:09:28  <simonstewart> Have you seen the gem that automagically converts the IE testing images to virtualbox ones
2011-09-29T16:09:29  <simonstewart> ?

2011-09-29T16:10:12  <jarib> no
2011-09-29T16:10:40  <ian_mac> do you guys run Selenium on your xserve?

2011-09-29T16:12:26  <ian_mac> well, yes, I assumed that.
2011-09-29T16:13:00  <ian_mac> I remember having trouble getting it to use the x server/display because I wasn't starting it from the OS X shell
2011-09-29T16:13:09  <ian_mac> was I doing something weird?  or is there a trick?
2011-09-29T16:13:49  <ian_mac> I'll have to try it again.  It's been a while
2011-09-29T16:14:00  <jarib> it's not that hard
2011-09-29T16:15:16  <jarib> basically on linux you can just do e.g. `apt-get -y install tightvncserver; tightvncserver :1; DISPLAY=:1 ./your-selenium-script`

2011-09-29T16:18:10  <ian_mac> I assumed your xserve was running OS X
2011-09-29T16:18:19  <jarib> it's running VMs
2011-09-29T16:18:51  <simonstewart> The xserve is running OS X and we're hosting VMs on that
2011-09-29T16:18:52  <jarib> on OS X i think the bamboo agent is just launched in Terminal.app and it just works
2011-09-29T16:19:26  <ian_mac> ok
2011-09-29T16:22:16  <jarib> simonstewart: main problem so far with virtualbox/vagrant is that you can't really launch/kill VMs concurrently
2011-09-29T16:22:28  <simonstewart> Aye
2011-09-29T16:22:33  <jarib> so there's a lock
2011-09-29T16:22:38  <simonstewart> What we need is an infinite grid of machines
2011-09-29T16:23:04  <jarib> which seems to work ok. until one of them gets stuck
2011-09-29T16:23:09  <jarib> indeed, that'd help :)
2011-09-29T16:23:11  <simonstewart> I notice that KVM claims to be able to support multiple VMs
2011-09-29T16:23:48  <simonstewart> Or we could look at Fusion or Parallels if necessary

2011-09-29T16:27:25  <simonstewart> interesting
2011-09-29T16:28:36  <algard> we used vsphere @ our place to spin up lots of VMs
2011-09-29T16:29:05  <simonstewart> Ahhh....
2011-09-29T16:29:09  <simonstewart> I've used KVM before
2011-09-29T16:32:42  <jarib> i'll see how far i can get with vagrant, since it's so easy to automate

2011-09-29T18:37:15  <k04n> How can I set a username and password in Selenium Server?
2011-09-29T18:37:15  <simonstewart> Getting there
2011-09-29T18:37:20  <simonstewart> My cold seems to have abated
2011-09-29T18:37:26  <k04n> i dont want anyone to be able to connect to my machine and control the browser:)
2011-09-29T18:38:41  <adamgoucher> k04n: slap a firewall on it. the server is 'dumb' and doesnt have that stuff in it (by design)
2011-09-29T18:38:53  <k04n> adamgoucher: ok, gotcha, thanks
2011-09-29T18:39:04  <k04n> was wondering why i couldnt find any settings like that in the docs :)
2011-09-29T18:39:06  <adamgoucher> simonstewart: how long are you down there? long enough to adjust then head home?
2011-09-29T18:39:06  <k04n> ok, another q..
2011-09-29T18:39:15  <k04n> can selenium server drive HtmlUnit?
2011-09-29T18:39:20  <simonstewart> Two weeks in all
2011-09-29T18:39:24  <simonstewart> Nearing the end of my first
2011-09-29T18:39:32  <adamgoucher> k04n: if you use the java bindings, then yes
2011-09-29T18:39:38  <simonstewart> k04n: You can use the htmlunit driver directly if you're using java
2011-09-29T18:39:43  <simonstewart> no need to start the server
2011-09-29T18:39:55  <k04n> i have some existing comprehensive test suites in PHPUnit
2011-09-29T18:39:56  *** dmachi has quit IRC
2011-09-29T18:40:04  <k04n> it is used to connceting to the server...
2011-09-29T18:40:06  *** dmachi has joined #selenium
2011-09-29T18:40:11  <k04n> i was wondering if i could easily use that to drive htmlunit
2011-09-29T18:41:32  <simonstewart> The RC APIs with htmlunit won't work
2011-09-29T18:41:37  <simonstewart> The webdriver ones will
2011-09-29T18:42:30  <k04n> Selenium Server uses webdriver to control firefox, etc., right?
2011-09-29T18:45:51  <adamgoucher> think i may have found someone to take over the php se-ide format plugin on the phpunit list :)
2011-09-29T18:46:11  <adamgoucher> you use either webdriver or remote control to control the server which controls the browser
2011-09-29T18:46:20  *** cgp_ has quit IRC
2011-09-29T18:46:24  <adamgoucher> (or you can just use webdriver 'native' and not use the server)
2011-09-29T18:46:41  <k04n> adamgoucher: im not sure i follow
2011-09-29T18:46:50  <k04n> is there a doc somewhere, or can someone show me how to set up HtmlUnit with selenium
2011-09-29T18:47:08  <k04n> i dont want to have to rewrite my test cases, i just want to pipe existing ones that were working with selenium server+firefox, etc….into htmlunit
2011-09-29T18:47:20  * adamgoucher points you are simonstewart -- adamgoucher is allergic to java
2011-09-29T18:49:21  <simonstewart> k04n: if you're using the selenium RC APIs (and it sounds like you are if you're using phpunit) then you won't be able to get htmlunit to work
2011-09-29T18:49:45  <k04n> simonstewart: so theres no way to get the seleniumserver.jar to drive an instance of HTMLUnit as opposed to FireFox, IE, etc?
2011-09-29T18:50:10  <simonstewart> There is, but, and I repeat this again to be very clear, not if you're using the RC APIs
2011-09-29T18:50:53  <k04n> i see..
2011-09-29T18:50:57  <k04n> what APIs would i need to use instead?
2011-09-29T18:51:09  <k04n> i suppose ive only come in to selenium thru RC apis
2011-09-29T18:51:14  <simonstewart> The webdriver ones
2011-09-29T18:51:27  <simonstewart> https://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver
2011-09-29T18:51:49  <k04n> ok, i see now

2011-09-29T23:41:05  *** zmijunkie has joined #selenium
2011-09-29T23:41:13  <rtyler> barancev: it is some stupid magic textarea element, javascript hides the element so the webdriver has issues with it, not a big deal
2011-09-29T23:41:21  <rtyler> having to drop to xpath for the radio button thouhg, blech
2011-09-29T23:41:37  <Mox[NL]> xpath is awesome
2011-09-29T23:42:04  <barancev> rtyler: what text area? a javascribt-based editor?
2011-09-29T23:42:49  <timc3> barancev: Its 'NS_ERROR_MALFORMED_URI'. Looking at the generated test, it does driver.get("/authentication/login/") without the self.base_url
2011-09-29T23:43:22  <rtyler> barancev: kind of yeah, I'm skipping ahead and i'll leave that be for now
2011-09-29T23:43:26  <barancev> timc3: then, pass wellformed URI
2011-09-29T23:43:37  <barancev> get requiref full URL

2011-09-29T23:44:07  <timc3> barancev: I am generating the tests using Selenium IDE, perhaps I should edit the tests after I have exported them?
2011-09-29T23:44:11  <rtyler> hmm, with the new webdriver api, since I'm not calling wait_for_page_to_load
2011-09-29T23:44:15  <rtyler> what should I be calling?
2011-09-29T23:44:39  <barancev> timc3: yes, IDE sometimes lies :)
2011-09-29T23:45:24  <barancev> rtyler: nothing.  read about implicit and explicit waits: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html#explicit-and-implicit-waits
2011-09-29T23:46:19  <rtyler> barancev: so I should just try to find a new element on the next page then?
2011-09-29T23:46:28  <barancev> rtyler: exactly
2011-09-29T23:46:39  <timc3> barancev: Maybe its easier to edit the formatter...
2011-09-29T23:47:55  <rtyler> barancev: would it be stupid to just wait.until the new page's title shows up?
2011-09-29T23:48:39  <barancev> rtyler: yes, if the title should change
2011-09-29T23:50:14  <darius_w> does webdriver on the remote node still uses proxy to inject javascript?
2011-09-29T23:50:54  <barancev> timc3: you can try this way, as a workaround. there is an issue #2373 on the subject
2011-09-29T23:50:55  <selbot2>  open/new Selenium IDE does not export baseURL in JUnit 4 (webdriver) - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2373 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Component-IDE]

2011-09-29T23:57:40  <rtyler> this feels like enough progress for tonight, I'm off to sleep :)
2011-09-29T23:58:20  <barancev> rtyler: nice idea!
2011-09-29T23:58:28  <barancev> :)
2011-09-29T23:58:40  <rtyler> we've been meaning to do this for a while
2011-09-29T23:58:51  <rtyler> we should have done it ages ago to be honest :/
2011-09-29T23:59:10  * rtyler passes out
