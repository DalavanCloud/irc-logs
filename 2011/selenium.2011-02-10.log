2011-02-10T02:32:49  <cozy_> hello, does Selenium have a posibility to call a test file like a subroutine? Reason is I test a site and for different combinations of input to a form I have to test alwasys the same things on the page..so at this moment I am copy pasting code and using test suites
2011-02-10T02:36:42  <cozy_> would be nice to have a selenium command like |call|<path>|

2011-02-10T02:54:13  <AutomatedTester> cozy_: if you were using Selenium RC instead of Selenium IDE you could create data driven tests
2011-02-10T02:54:25  <AutomatedTester> using one of the supported languages
2011-02-10T02:59:09  <cozy_> AutomatedTester: i was looking at that too, looks quite good, but since the client wants to run the tests, I have no option but the IDE in browser
2011-02-10T02:59:46  <AutomatedTester> why cant you give them an executable?
2011-02-10T03:03:41  <cozy_> AutomatedTester: hmm, that would be an idea...
2011-02-10T03:04:22  <cozy_> but, regardless of this, maybe it's worth having such a feature...
2011-02-10T03:04:45  <cozy_> not only for this, but to build more structured testscases/test-suites
2011-02-10T03:05:18  <AutomatedTester> cozy_: IDE is there to help people get things right for RC...
2011-02-10T03:05:33  <AutomatedTester> build in IDE export to RC, tweak and make it better
2011-02-10T03:05:42  <AutomatedTester> but raise it in the issues tracker

2011-02-10T06:34:04  <selbot2> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ArchitecturalOverview (+ 1 more result)
2011-02-10T06:34:08  <jarib> hmm
2011-02-10T06:34:27  <jarib> it would be nice to have this page a bit more up to date http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriverInternals
2011-02-10T06:34:39  <jarib> especially on what's needed to build/debug the driver
2011-02-10T06:34:41  <jimevans> yes it would. wish I had time to update it.
2011-02-10T06:35:10  <jarib> i'd like to dig into #1271, but am not sure what tools i need
2011-02-10T06:35:10  <selbot2> jari.bakken open/accepted IE driver hangs on exit after taking screenshot - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1271
2011-02-10T06:35:38  <jimevans> I saw the issue; haven't been able to look at it yet.
2011-02-10T06:35:50  <jarib> i couldn't reproduce it with the java driver
2011-02-10T06:36:33  <jarib> and since all the ruby at_exit hooks finish successfully, i'm not sure what to try next
2011-02-10T06:36:55  <jarib> on linux i'd probably poke around with strace
2011-02-10T06:37:17  <jimevans> What I would do to debug it is attach the Visual Studio debugger to the ruby.exe process, and see what happens after the call to StopServer.
2011-02-10T06:37:52  <jimevans> At least, that's what I was planning to do when I look at the issue.

2011-02-10T06:59:24  <AutomatedTester> sddf: its already running
2011-02-10T06:59:30  <AutomatedTester> well thats what the message says
2011-02-10T06:59:41  <jarib> jimevans: the browser itself is obviously c++. but the operadriver is pure java at the moment
2011-02-10T06:59:51  <Xtree^> or something else is on port 4444, for whatever reason
2011-02-10T07:00:40  <skip> I don't think it is the "Same Origin Policy"
2011-02-10T07:00:45  <skip> The RCs are on different ports
2011-02-10T07:01:08  <AutomatedTester> skip: is your test moving from your site to linkedin?
2011-02-10T07:01:39  <jarib> jimevans: although i'd probably enjoy re-implementing the scope stuff in ruby, it's not very pragmatic when we have this nice wire protocol :)
2011-02-10T07:01:54  <skip> Yeah, just that
2011-02-10T07:02:24  <AutomatedTester> so is linkedin.com and skip...com the same address?
2011-02-10T07:02:41  <AutomatedTester> since they arent its breaking same origin policy
2011-02-10T07:02:58  <skip> No,
2011-02-10T07:03:05  <skip> I own www.skiphuffman.com
2011-02-10T07:03:10  <AutomatedTester> moving from http to https breaks same origin policy
2011-02-10T07:03:42  <Xtree^> that's kinda weird that it works in firefox then though
2011-02-10T07:04:12  <Xtree^> oh, that's a different error than the one you spammed in chat earlier
2011-02-10T07:04:13  <AutomatedTester> Xtree^: for firefox we run at the Chrome level avoiding some of the sandbox issues
2011-02-10T07:04:17  <skip> let me change it so it goes somewhere else
2011-02-10T07:04:32  <AutomatedTester> skip: get it to go somewhere else on your site
2011-02-10T07:05:01  <Xtree^> AutomatedTester: would it also work in Chrome?
2011-02-10T07:05:12  <AutomatedTester> no...
2011-02-10T07:05:18  <AutomatedTester> Xtree^: IE and Firefox only
2011-02-10T07:05:28  <Xtree^> thats ..... cool, I guess
2011-02-10T07:05:55  <AutomatedTester> since firefox works in its Chrome level. Thats why it used to be recommended to do *chrome to get Firefox
2011-02-10T07:06:04  <AutomatedTester> and IE is *iehta
2011-02-10T07:07:02  <AutomatedTester> but we did work to get them to be the defaults to avoid people complaining
2011-02-10T07:07:31  <AutomatedTester> no seriously need to get on with other things :D
2011-02-10T07:07:35  <skip> No change for opera

2011-02-10T07:10:26  <Xtree^> thank you sir
2011-02-10T07:10:44  <AutomatedTester> its a shame Google decided to call their project Chrome
2011-02-10T07:10:58  <Xtree^> ohhhh, that
2011-02-10T07:10:58  <AutomatedTester> since Mozilla had been using it for years
2011-02-10T07:11:13  <skip> Actually I lied about versions.  Everything is running local at the moment, so all on python 2.6.6
2011-02-10T07:11:21  <Xtree^> yeah, that always confused me, when I first saw it, I thought it had something to do with google's browser
2011-02-10T07:12:41  <Xtree^> skip: I'm only glancing at the code but is it possible that the element its looking for isn't there, or is in a different form, in Opera?
2011-02-10T07:13:03  <skip> Naw.  The page is very simple stupid html.
2011-02-10T07:13:13  <skip> Should be the same in everything from Lynx on up.
2011-02-10T07:13:29  <skip> (which is why I am using it to diagnose this problem)

2011-02-10T07:16:02  *** jdlee has quit IRC
2011-02-10T07:16:37  <jimevans> Continuing our conversation: so to understand the current implementation, the driver code is in Java, so the operawatir code launches a java server?
2011-02-10T07:19:15  <jarib> jimevans: no, there's no server
2011-02-10T07:19:22  <denizt> there is a server :)
2011-02-10T07:19:26  <denizt> operadriver is a server
2011-02-10T07:19:33  <jarib> it's java -> [scope protocol] -> opera
2011-02-10T07:19:37  <Xtree^> skip: from glances at the code, it looks like opera just can't the element. No idea why if its just a plain HTML page
2011-02-10T07:19:41  <jarib> denizt: not in the sense jimevans means (i think)
2011-02-10T07:20:07  <denizt> yes, it is not a server like the current webdriver servers, but it is a server that accepts incoming connections
2011-02-10T07:20:15  <jarib> incoming connections from opera
2011-02-10T07:20:18  <denizt> opera makes outbound connections unlike othere browsers
2011-02-10T07:20:35  <jarib> right
2011-02-10T07:21:05  <jarib> jimevans: denizt wrote operadriver
2011-02-10T07:21:22  <jimevans> okay, so i'm trying to get my head around this stuff, mainly because I'm a .NET guy, and there's no .NET support yet.
2011-02-10T07:21:25  *** antlong has joined #selenium
2011-02-10T07:21:36  <skip> Using an internal link allows googlechrome to work, but opera still fails
2011-02-10T07:22:10  <jarib> jimevans: to support opera from .NET, you'd either need to stick the remotewebdriver java server in between, or port the operadriver java code to .NET
2011-02-10T07:22:20  <denizt> you would need to write almost all of it or use a layer in between
2011-02-10T07:22:55  <jimevans> jarib: I figured that. I'm just trying to understand the scope of the undertaking.
2011-02-10T07:22:57  <skip> Off to a meeting.  Will struggle with this more later.
2011-02-10T07:23:39  <jimevans> denizt: Forgive my unfamiliarity with Opera; I've never used it. Does Opera allow incoming connections as a built-in part of its feature set?
2011-02-10T07:24:19  <denizt> the reason we have outgoing connections is for devices (cant bind to a port) and/or firewalls
2011-02-10T07:25:38  <jarib> jimevans: as far as i understand, opera does an outgoing connection to operadriver, they then communicate using the scope protocol (which is based on protocol buffers)
2011-02-10T07:25:55  <denizt> yes, exactly
2011-02-10T07:26:50  *** jdlee has joined #selenium
2011-02-10T07:26:50  *** jdlee has joined #selenium
2011-02-10T07:30:56  <jimevans> okay thanks guys. I'm going to have to download the code and take a look at it in more detail.
2011-02-10T07:31:09  <jimevans> But let me see if I've got the basic gist of it.
2011-02-10T07:32:01  <jimevans> The java OperaDriver sets up a listening socket, then launches Opera using some command-line switch magic, Opera connects on the socket, and Bob's your uncle.
2011-02-10T07:32:16  <denizt> more or less
2011-02-10T07:32:33  <denizt> the command line switch magic is not yet out in public builds
2011-02-10T07:33:12  <denizt> set auto-connect on in opera:config
2011-02-10T07:33:48  <jimevans> denizt: Is that in place of, or in addition to the command line switches?
2011-02-10T07:34:06  <denizt> http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/operawatir/start/
2011-02-10T07:34:21  <denizt> the command line switch is going to make everything auto magic
2011-02-10T07:34:47  <denizt> there is no command line switch right now, iirc watir sends opera:debug so it starts with that page
2011-02-10T07:35:34  <jimevans> Got it. Thanks. If we get this pulled into the selenium source tree, maybe I'll take a crack at a .NET implementation.
2011-02-10T07:36:22  <denizt> it will get into the source tree soon I hope
2011-02-10T07:37:37  <antlong> is opera oss?
2011-02-10T07:38:09  <jimevans> antlong: emphatically no. but the driver implementation is. :)

2011-02-10T08:35:19  <jarib> ah
2011-02-10T08:35:24  <jarib> let's do that then
2011-02-10T08:35:27  <dereke_> but it means reworking the temp file business
2011-02-10T08:35:36  <dereke_> because that class seems to create a file

2011-02-10T10:42:26  <nirvdrum> skip: You can swap out the version of Selenium RC in grid.  1.0.3 is kind of a piece of shit.
2011-02-10T10:42:36  *** plightbo has joined #selenium
2011-02-10T10:42:42  <nirvdrum> Hey plightbo
2011-02-10T10:42:59  <skip> I am running 1.0.8
2011-02-10T10:43:03  <plightbo> hola
2011-02-10T10:43:12  <plightbo> so chooseOkOnNextConfirmation isn't supported in the WebDriverBackedSelenium?
2011-02-10T10:43:29  <plightbo> are confirmations supported at all?
2011-02-10T10:43:34  <skip> But I think these "hidden" rcs might be causing some of my problems.
2011-02-10T10:43:37  <plightbo> i'm still on 2.0a5 so might be that it was added later
2011-02-10T10:43:37  <nirvdrum> skip: Grid is basically a wrapper to Selenium RC server.  grid 1.0.8 ships with Selenium RC 1.0.3.  You can swap that out with the 2.0beta1 selenium standalone JAR.
2011-02-10T10:43:46  <skip> Ah!
2011-02-10T10:44:00  <skip> I do have the beta, how do I tell grid to use that?
2011-02-10T10:44:43  <nirvdrum> Change out the JAR in vendor/.  Just make it the same name as the old file.
2011-02-10T10:44:45  <ipmb> excellent, thx nirvdrum
2011-02-10T10:47:49  <RossPatterson> plightbo: I believe alerts and confirmations first appeared in 2.0b1.
2011-02-10T10:48:06  <nirvdrum> plightbo: Not sure.  But I think 2.0b1 added initial support (Firefox only) for dealing with alerts.
2011-02-10T10:48:11  <plightbo> got it
2011-02-10T10:48:13  <plightbo> thought so
2011-02-10T10:48:17  <nirvdrum> But none of that works with the latest Firefox 4 beta.
2011-02-10T10:48:18  <skip> so I can just copy in  selenium-server-standalone-2.0b1.jar over the vendor/.....1.0.3....?
2011-02-10T10:48:24  <nirvdrum> 4.0 beta 10 broke everything I think.

2011-02-10T11:06:03  <plightbo> so how do we do confirmation boxes in 1.0?
2011-02-10T11:06:07  <plightbo> i can't get that going
2011-02-10T11:06:16  <plightbo> doing chooseOkOnNextConfirmation before I click the link
2011-02-10T11:06:23  <plightbo> doing assertConfirmationPresent after I click the link
2011-02-10T11:06:51  <plightbo> and no matter what I get this lame error that an unexpected confirmation is present
2011-02-10T11:11:56  <RossPatterson> plightnbo: That works for us, running RC 1.0.1.
2011-02-10T11:12:01  <mattmtl> how can I get the list of options from a select element?
2011-02-10T11:15:33  <nirvdrum> plightbo: In 1.0 there's is isAlertPresent()
2011-02-10T11:15:42  <nirvdrum> Too many "is" in there.
2011-02-10T11:15:53  <nirvdrum> And then I think it's getAlertText()
2011-02-10T11:16:08  <mattmtl> I am using 2.0 with the webdriver BTW
2011-02-10T11:16:27  <nirvdrum> The naming might be a bit different.  The Ruby driver changed the names a bit.
2011-02-10T11:16:41  <nirvdrum> Man, Google Code's SVN server is a piece of crap.
2011-02-10T11:18:31  <mattmtl> cool, found it!! I need to do: element.find_elements_by_tag_name("option")

2011-02-10T12:57:32  <XCulver> anybody know how to force it to always use ie32 vs ie64?
2011-02-10T12:58:06  <jimevans> XCulver: you can't. We will run 32-bit on x86 Windows, 64-bit on x64 Windows.
2011-02-10T12:58:29  <jimevans> It's a limitation of not being able to mix 32 and 64 bit binaries.
2011-02-10T12:58:57  <XCulver> ok
2011-02-10T12:59:03  <XCulver> i'm guessing this was forced later
2011-02-10T12:59:27  <XCulver> on alpha5 one machine always uses 32bit and the os is 64, and the other, it starts w/ 32 then kills 32 and goes to x64
2011-02-10T12:59:31  <XCulver> and both are win64
2011-02-10T13:00:01  <XCulver> and ie64 is really slow compared to ie32

2011-02-10T13:01:37  <antlong> can you uninstall ie64
2011-02-10T13:01:53  <jimevans> XCulver: that's a symptom of trying to use CoCreateInstance to start the browser, which pre-b1 IE driver did.
2011-02-10T13:02:09  <antlong> last time i tried i think they didnt let me >.>
2011-02-10T13:02:12  <jimevans> it's also why you always had to run as an elevated administrator
2011-02-10T13:02:25  <jimevans> antlong: no, you can't uninstall 64-bit IE.
2011-02-10T13:02:36  <XCulver> ok, makes sense
2011-02-10T13:02:37  <antlong> that should be illegal
2011-02-10T13:02:39  <antlong> lol
2011-02-10T13:02:48  <XCulver> just curious why one machine gives me issues and the other doesn't
2011-02-10T13:03:26  <jimevans> i don't recall what language bindings you're using, but it could be related to the runtime of that language (32- vs 64-bit).
2011-02-10T13:03:49  <XCulver> c# for .net
2011-02-10T13:04:02  <XCulver> well .net bindings
2011-02-10T13:05:24  <jimevans> only thing i can think of is your .net project build settings. possibly one machine doesn't have the x64 cross-compiler tools installed.
2011-02-10T13:05:29  *** ojacobson has quit IRC
2011-02-10T13:05:38  <jimevans> (they're not by default, even on x64 os).
2011-02-10T13:05:55  <XCulver> jimevans: thanks, i'll check that out
2011-02-10T13:07:03  <jimevans> but at any rate, you're still on 2.0a5, and that codebase is getting older and more obsolete by the day.
2011-02-10T13:07:13  <jimevans> (yes I'm aware of why you don't upgrade).
2011-02-10T13:07:39  <XCulver> when i get some downtime i'm going to switch
2011-02-10T13:07:51  <XCulver> and shrink my tests so debugging wont be as much of an issue
2011-02-10T13:08:15  <jimevans> if you want to take on the challenge of changing the .net bindings to work differently, i'll gladly accept a patch. :)
2011-02-10T13:08:50  <XCulver> someday i'll feel confident enough to try
