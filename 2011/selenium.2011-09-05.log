2011-09-05T00:43:15  <djonsson> Hi, a bit of a noob question. How do I translate this "html body.front div#header-wrapper.wrapper header#header div#account-menu a.logout" into a CSS Target that can be read by the Selenium IDE? The HTML looks like this: "<a class="logout">Log out</a>" and the current target is set to "Link=Log out" which is bad since the site is localised into different languages.
2011-09-05T01:07:52  <Stuk> Ajay: a pull request on github would be the best way

2011-09-05T01:20:25  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, ping
2011-09-05T01:21:50  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, do you know is there a way to set proxy for IE and googlechrome like firefox:classself.profile.set_preference("network.proxy.type", 1) ?

2011-09-05T01:22:40  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, oh, will them have in the near future ?
2011-09-05T01:22:52  <AutomatedTester> at the end of the week I am travelling to the US and will use my travel/jet lag to port BrowserMob Proxy stuff to python
2011-09-05T01:23:05  <webben> djonsson: Other than the fact that your initial string of CSS is brittle because it contains loads of irrelevant detail, what's wrong with it?
2011-09-05T01:23:22  <webben> (I'd try using a.logout)
2011-09-05T01:23:26  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, ok,thanks
2011-09-05T01:23:34  <AutomatedTester> Glynnis: and then you just need to route stuff through that to get what you want
2011-09-05T01:23:36  <AutomatedTester> plus more
2011-09-05T01:24:34  <webben> Is there a way to configure selenium(2) server with specific paths to the binaries for specific browser launchers
2011-09-05T01:24:35  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, I want to set proxy to access some web page behind the proxy
2011-09-05T01:25:01  <webben> (to avoid the warnings about finding a script rather than a binary?)
2011-09-05T01:25:13  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, that means I have to set a specific proxy
2011-09-05T01:25:41  <webben> I mean presumably one could override the Launcher class in question but that seems heavyhanded.
2011-09-05T01:25:59  <webben> I'd expected to find some sort of properties file, but there doesn't seem to be one.

2011-09-05T01:46:43  <Stuk> Ajay: never used tortoisegit myself, but you'll have to "fork" the operadriver project on github, somehow add that repo as a remote in tortoise, and then push to there
2011-09-05T01:46:56  <Stuk> then back on github you can set up a pull request

2011-09-05T02:42:52  <jarib> krosenvold: hi
2011-09-05T02:43:23  <krosenvold> I'm trying to understand how some of these tests hang together, how is TestSeleniumServerLauncher launched ?
2011-09-05T02:43:39  <krosenvold> That was to all of you ;)
2011-09-05T02:44:33  <krosenvold> Particularly freynaud who claims to know testng ;)
2011-09-05T02:44:45  <samit> Ajay: I took a quick look at your patch. Good work
2011-09-05T02:44:56  <freynaud> krosenvold: is it testng related ?
2011-09-05T02:45:01  <Ajay> samit: Thanks
2011-09-05T02:45:05  <samit> Ajay: I have a couple of suggestions.
2011-09-05T02:45:09  <krosenvold> I have no idea. I'm trying to write a testcase for selenium server
2011-09-05T02:45:16  <Ajay> Yeah sure
2011-09-05T02:45:22  <krosenvold> And there seem to be some dark testng magics going on
2011-09-05T02:45:36  <samit> Ajay: You should also include these in your test cases: regex:}${
2011-09-05T02:45:37  <krosenvold> I'm  a happy junit user
2011-09-05T02:45:54  <krosenvold> How can I know which testcase uses TSSL ?
2011-09-05T02:46:01  <freynaud> krosenvold: what's dark about server launcher ?
2011-09-05T02:46:03  <samit> Ajay: You should also include these in your test cases: regex:\}${1,2}
2011-09-05T02:46:13  <krosenvold> How is it invoked ?
2011-09-05T02:46:29  <samit> Ajay: You should also include these in your test cases: regex:\${2}
2011-09-05T02:47:05  <freynaud> krosenvold: are you sure it is inviked ?
2011-09-05T02:47:10  <freynaud> invoked
2011-09-05T02:47:23  <krosenvold> No, I am not sure of anything. For all I can see it is unused code ;)
2011-09-05T02:47:27  <samit> Ajay: It is always a good thing to list a set of test cases with the patch if you can.
2011-09-05T02:47:57  <Ajay> samit where are the ide tests
2011-09-05T02:48:12  <Ajay> can you point me so i can include these as well
2011-09-05T02:48:32  <freynaud> krosenvold: it's not really a testNG question. It's more a crazy fun build one :) When Simon integrated the grid testNG stuff, he had to specificly create a testng.xml to specify the tests to use
2011-09-05T02:48:40  <samit> Ajay: perhaps davehunt can point you in the right direction
2011-09-05T02:48:53  <freynaud> krosenvold: I don't see that for this package, so it looks unused to me too
2011-09-05T02:49:06  <krosenvold> Does he autogenerated testng.xml ?
2011-09-05T02:49:11  <krosenvold> autogenerate
2011-09-05T02:49:20  <freynaud> no
2011-09-05T02:49:45  <krosenvold> There are no testng.xml files, doh

2011-09-05T02:50:20  <freynaud> selenium/java/server/test/org/openqa/grid/grid-tests.xml
2011-09-05T02:50:50  <freynaud> that's the entry point for the grid tests
2011-09-05T02:51:06  <krosenvold> Hmm. But that's only for grid
2011-09-05T02:51:45  <freynaud> yes.There is not much logic in SeverLauncher, and nothing using testNG. Converting it to junit will probably be easier
2011-09-05T02:51:51  <davehunt> Ajay: Selenium IDE tests are here: http://hg.mozilla.org/qa/mozmill-tests/file/b1940f446522/tests/addons/ide%40seleniumhq.org

2011-09-05T02:53:34  <freynaud> krosenvold: actually, the xml i gave you isn't used either. To see how to invoke testNG from crazy build, have a look at selenium/java/server/test/org/openqa/grid/e2e/build.desc
2011-09-05T02:53:48  <krosenvold> Well somehow the CFB is a nice idea, because it integrates this whole mess into a single project. +100 for that

2011-09-05T02:55:22  <krosenvold> But I think it should be built on top of best-choice language specific builds instead of reinventing everything. The duplication in the .desc files is totally crazy

2011-09-05T02:56:53  <krosenvold> If there was anything "fun" about the build it would use byte-code analysis to determine what the proper dependencies were
2011-09-05T02:56:58  <samit> Ajay: I think I have already solved this issue and a bunch of related stuff when I started working on the stored vars support in webdriver formatters. It should be on one of my workstations as soon as I have a couple of hours free I will pick up your patch. Thanks!

2011-09-05T03:57:14  <Ajay> simonstewart: i will need little help on #314
2011-09-05T03:57:14  <selbot2_>  open/accepted WebElement.clear() should require element to be editable - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=314 [Type-Enhancement Priority-Medium Component-WebDriver]
2011-09-05T03:57:35  <simonstewart> ok
2011-09-05T03:57:39  <simonstewart> 'sup?
2011-09-05T03:57:41  <simonstewart> What help do you need?
2011-09-05T03:57:57  <Ajay> i have changes ready for HtmlWebElement
2011-09-05T03:58:04  <simonstewart> k
2011-09-05T03:58:26  <Ajay> For the other drivers i am planning to have a isEditable() in the WebDriver Interface
2011-09-05T03:58:44  <Stuk> afternoon
2011-09-05T03:58:51  <simonstewart> I don't think that's what you need
2011-09-05T03:59:22  <Fry33_> In whar version you planning to add  isEditable()?
2011-09-05T03:59:37  <simonstewart> You can already just use "isEnabled"
2011-09-05T03:59:52  <simonstewart> http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#isEnabled()
2011-09-05T04:00:00  <Fry33_>  isEditable == isEbable?
2011-09-05T04:00:20  <simonstewart> Yes, according to the dos

2011-09-05T04:02:00  <Ajay> what about the readOnly Elements ?
2011-09-05T04:02:46  <simonstewart> We allow you to send keyboard input to readonly elements
2011-09-05T04:02:52  <simonstewart> it doesn't change their content
2011-09-05T04:03:04  <simonstewart> We could allow clear to go to them
2011-09-05T04:03:12  <simonstewart> or we could throw an exception of some sort
2011-09-05T04:03:21  <Ajay> ElementNotEditable
2011-09-05T04:03:28  <simonstewart> But we don't need to add another method to WebElement
2011-09-05T04:03:36  <simonstewart> As the check is internal to the driver
2011-09-05T04:04:05  <simonstewart> biab
2011-09-05T04:04:07  <Fry33_> so, now I use 2.4, how i can check is element editable?
2011-09-05T04:04:46  <Fry33_> element can be enable, but readonly, how I can handle this case?
2011-09-05T04:05:23  <Ajay> Fry33: simonstewart said sendKeys doesn't change  their content
2011-09-05T04:05:27  <krosenvold> simonstewart: https://gist.github.com/1194720
2011-09-05T04:05:36  <krosenvold> Check filename of the "log" file ;)
2011-09-05T04:06:02  <krosenvold> simonstewart: And the other thing is, of course, the massive failure on ff3
2011-09-05T04:06:40  <freynaud> simonstewart: is dwagner around ?
2011-09-05T04:07:03  <krosenvold> Does anyone know why typing tests seem to fail on the server tests on linux ?
2011-09-05T04:07:15  * krosenvold seems to remember this topic has been up on the ml
2011-09-05T04:07:24  <Fry33_> Ajay, so if undestood right, first I need to invoke isEbale if it return true, then try to type to it,if content willn't changed this element will be not editable, otherwise editable.
2011-09-05T04:07:36  <barancev> simonstewart: ave!
2011-09-05T04:08:45  <simonstewart> Fry33_: isEditable and then getAttribute('readOnly')
2011-09-05T04:08:54  <barancev> simonstewart: bug bash in progress: is #14 implemented? :)

2011-09-05T04:09:37  <barancev> yes, I'm asking The Simon :)
2011-09-05T04:12:00  <simonstewart> krosenvold: no idea. Which platform?

2011-09-05T04:19:02  <krosenvold> simonstewart: How can I find out where CombinedInputActionsTest is run ? I want to find out if it's failing only with server
2011-09-05T04:19:02  <simonstewart> It should be run everywhere

2011-09-05T04:19:03  <krosenvold> So that means it's failing for some "server" reason...
2011-09-05T04:19:03  <simonstewart> Kicking off a build here to see if I see the same thing

2011-09-05T04:48:19  <simonstewart> right
2011-09-05T04:48:43  <barancev> should I have to specify qualified class name?
2011-09-05T04:48:46  <krosenvold> onlyRun=DragAndDropTest might have to work
2011-09-05T04:49:44  <barancev> no result, either
2011-09-05T04:51:46  <barancev> yes, no need to specify class name al all
2011-09-05T04:53:57  <barancev> and - this testDragAndDrop failed for me (win7 x64, ff 6.0.1)
2011-09-05T04:54:12  <simonstewart> That test has always been problematic
2011-09-05T04:54:23  <simonstewart> I really have a strong dislike for drag and drop

2011-09-05T04:58:05  <sdf_> hi
2011-09-05T04:58:08  <sdf_> one question
2011-09-05T04:58:26  <simonstewart> Normally when we see that the underlying xpcom component hasn't been unwrapped or wrapped in the right way
2011-09-05T04:58:31  <sdf_> my selenium tests work when i write firefox for browser
2011-09-05T04:58:34  <simonstewart> Firefox is very picky about that sort of thing
2011-09-05T04:58:37  <sdf_> but when i have iexplore
2011-09-05T04:58:39  <simonstewart> and inconsistent between versions
2011-09-05T04:58:46  <sdf_> some error keeps appearing
2011-09-05T04:58:58  <sdf_> so is it something with IE version maybe
2011-09-05T04:59:01  <sdf_> I use IE8
2011-09-05T04:59:03  <krosenvold> simonstewart: Do you have any referencing explaining this wrapping ?
2011-09-05T04:59:09  <barancev> chrome and opera are in good shape too,they do grag-n-drop w/o any glitch
2011-09-05T04:59:11  <krosenvold> simonstewart: But wouldn't that give an errpr ?
2011-09-05T04:59:24  <simonstewart> If it gave an error, it'd be easy

2011-09-05T07:37:39  <freynaud> mcr: the webdriver design is better I find. By having the profile and cert checked in together with the test code, you have a test that runs exactly the same locally or remotly
2011-09-05T07:37:45  <freynaud> mcr: cleaner.
2011-09-05T07:38:16  <mcr> freyaud - ah ok that makes sense with what I am seeing,,,so you would have to check it on...

2011-09-05T07:39:15  <freynaud> it needs to be somewhere accessible from you test. From you test setup you specify the ff profile, it will be passed in the capabilities map, serialized as a json object, sent to the remote, rebuilt, and used

Sorry if this was the wrong place to ask.
2011-09-05T08:20:02  <javi> hi all, I cant make selenium work with ChromeDriver, anyone has some example code i can see ?
2011-09-05T08:20:57  <simonstewart> Can you get the chromedriver itself to work?
2011-09-05T08:22:36  <javi> I ve managed to get a chrome window to open, but then it fails with org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Timed out waiting for ChromeDriver server to start.

2011-09-05T08:55:40  <webben> Is there a FOSS codebase that has examples of Selenium tests using PageObjects and page components?
2011-09-05T08:55:44  <andreashaas> the reason is that the click misses the element it should click on
2011-09-05T08:56:14  <andreashaas> I try to find out now why
2011-09-05T08:56:59  <andreashaas> because doubleClick uses similar code and works

2011-09-05T11:10:11  <webben> javi: It's in the DOM, therefore accessible via CSS/XPath selectors or walking the DOM.
2011-09-05T11:10:27  <webben> javi: the browser might not allow you to select text in it
2011-09-05T11:10:31  <webben> javi: does that help?

2011-09-05T12:49:47  <AutomatedTester> barancev: our typing should do tab, if the code on the page overwrites tab then it will move it on
2011-09-05T12:50:38  <barancev> if you type TAB to a text area or a text field, the browser moves focus to the next element by default
2011-09-05T12:51:33  <AutomatedTester> which is correct behaviour unless the javascript on the page overwrites what a tab does
2011-09-05T12:51:45  <barancev> exactly
2011-09-05T12:52:14  <barancev> but you can insert TAB using clipboard

2011-09-05T19:52:04  <keturn> crankharder: you can write the locator with 'css=' in front, e.g. 'css=#foo span.bar'
2011-09-05T19:52:36  <keturn> googling for docs on seleniumhq returns hits from a bunch of old versions, I'm not sure how to fix that :-/
2011-09-05T19:53:00  <keturn> but I don't think locator syntax has really changed much

2011-09-05T23:07:53  <krosenvold_> barancev: ping
2011-09-05T23:08:13  <barancev> krosenvold_: pong
2011-09-05T23:08:32  <krosenvold_> Hi, you seemed to "know" that htmlunit does not support ctrl-x etc ?
2011-09-05T23:08:38  * krosenvold_ doesnt
2011-09-05T23:09:00  * krosenvold_ does not have the faintest clue about the limitations of htmlunit
2011-09-05T23:16:14  <barancev> I know that HtmlUnit has no generic "keyboard support". it has support for several special cases -- tab to move focus and access keys
2011-09-05T23:17:32  <barancev> though.. may be I'm wrong
2011-09-05T23:18:06  <barancev> http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/keyboard-howto.html - that's the basis for my opinion
2011-09-05T23:18:19  <barancev> let me look into the code
2011-09-05T23:23:29  <barancev> org.openqa.selenium.htmlunit.HtmlUnitKeyboard has performSingleKeyAction method that seems to send keyboard events via fireEvent
2011-09-05T23:25:12  <barancev> but sendKeys does not use it, it just assign text to the value attribute

2011-09-05T23:27:31  <Fry33_> good moning everyone.
2011-09-05T23:27:47  <barancev> I'm still not sure if we could send "Ctrl-down" event and then "v" and then "Ctrl-up" -- wll HtmlUtil get data from the clipboard and paste it to the input field? hmm..
2011-09-05T23:28:00  <Fry33_> How implement Se1.waitForPageToLoad medthod via webdriver?
2011-09-05T23:29:19  <barancev> lemme check with vanilla HtmlUnit...
2011-09-05T23:37:17  <barancev> no, I don't know how to emulate Ctrl-v in HtmlUnit
2011-09-05T23:37:37  <barancev> http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/apidocs/com/gargoylesoftware/htmlunit/html/HtmlElement.html#type(char, boolean, boolean, boolean) - this method does not work
2011-09-05T23:38:09  *** csanchez has joined #selenium
2011-09-05T23:38:15  <barancev> it just inserts "v"
2011-09-05T23:38:29  <barancev> a row of "Ctrl-down" event and then "v" and then "Ctrl-up" has the same effect
2011-09-05T23:39:16  <Fry33_> ctrl+insert?
2011-09-05T23:44:14  <krosenvold_> barancev: That sounds convincing. I'll disable the test for htmlunit ;)

2011-09-05T23:47:44  <barancev> morning!
2011-09-05T23:52:37  <selbot2_> kristian.rosenvold@gmail.com half a minute ago - KristianRosenvold: Disabled test for HtmlUnit, not supported - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=13744
2011-09-05T23:53:11  <krosenvold_> barancev: Does HtmlUnit support multiple windows ?
2011-09-05T23:53:42  <krosenvold_> ClickTest#testShouldOnlyFollowHrefOnce also fails
2011-09-05T23:54:04  <barancev> krosenvold_: yet, it should. windows and frames
2011-09-05T23:54:14  <krosenvold_> Doh. Wonder why the test falils
2011-09-05T23:54:28  <barancev> there are WebWindow and FrameWindow objects that represent them
