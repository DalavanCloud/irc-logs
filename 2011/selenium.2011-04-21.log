2011-04-21T02:10:27  <gtailleb> hi AutomatedTester, do you know if there is a way to take a screenshot with a remote webdriver?
2011-04-21T02:10:36  <gtailleb> should i add a capacity?

2011-04-21T02:23:54  <freynaud> you need to use the augmenter
2011-04-21T02:24:04  <AutomatedTester> back
2011-04-21T02:24:14  <AutomatedTester> yep, exactly what freynaud said
2011-04-21T02:24:24  <gtailleb> like desiredCapabilities.setCapability(CapabilityType.TAKES_SCREENSHOT, true); ?
2011-04-21T02:25:22  <gtailleb> i'm doing this :
2011-04-21T02:25:22  <gtailleb> desiredCapabilities.setCapability(CapabilityType.TAKES_SCREENSHOT, true);
2011-04-21T02:25:22  <gtailleb> driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(url), desiredCapabilities);
2011-04-21T02:25:26  * AutomatedTester finds the email quickly
2011-04-21T02:25:40  <gtailleb> and then
2011-04-21T02:25:40  <gtailleb> File scrFile = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
2011-04-21T02:26:06  <gtailleb> but i get java.lang.ClassCastException: org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver cannot be cast to org.openqa.selenium.TakesScreenshot
2011-04-21T02:26:24  <freynaud> WebDriver screenshotDriver = new Augmenter().augment(this);
2011-04-21T02:26:24  <freynaud> 			File tmp = ((TakesScreenshot) screenshotDriver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
2011-04-21T02:26:24  <freynaud> 			tmp.renameTo(destination);
2011-04-21T02:26:36  <freynaud> something like that
2011-04-21T02:26:49  <freynaud> you may have to build from trunk
2011-04-21T02:27:00  <freynaud> i think the decoding was broken in b3
2011-04-21T02:27:21  <gtailleb> ok :/
2011-04-21T02:27:25  <gtailleb> i'll try that thx
2011-04-21T02:27:29  <AutomatedTester> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1208891
2011-04-21T02:27:36  <AutomatedTester> I *think* thats what your are supposed to do
2011-04-21T02:28:07  <gtailleb> thx AutomatedTester!
2011-04-21T02:28:15  <gtailleb> and thx freynaud too
2011-04-21T02:30:10  <freynaud> I think your're right AutometedTester
2011-04-21T02:30:18  <freynaud> and it works with grid :)
2011-04-21T02:31:26  <AutomatedTester> not bad for someone who never does Java
2011-04-21T02:31:53  <AutomatedTester> freynaud: have you seen issues with sending profiles over the wire?
2011-04-21T02:39:20  *** amitev has quit IRC
2011-04-21T02:41:37  <freynaud> no
2011-04-21T02:41:51  <freynaud> i'm not sending complex profiles though
2011-04-21T02:42:04  <freynaud> just a cert8 file usually
2011-04-21T02:42:12  <AutomatedTester> not changing the perfs?
2011-04-21T02:42:22  <freynaud> usually not
2011-04-21T02:42:26  <freynaud> user agent sometimes
2011-04-21T02:42:29  <freynaud> but that's it
2011-04-21T02:42:40  <freynaud> why, have you had issues ?
2011-04-21T02:42:57  <AutomatedTester> jimevans may have found a bug that the remotedriver doesnt do the silent start on firefox
2011-04-21T02:43:18  <AutomatedTester> so doesnt give it a chance to clean the user,js file
2011-04-21T02:51:14  *** ollikuhta has joined #selenium
2011-04-21T02:52:05  <ollikuhta> Does anyone know how to take Selenium::WebPage class in use?
2011-04-21T02:56:27  <freynaud> AutomatedTester: do you have more details on -silent not used ?
2011-04-21T02:56:41  <freynaud> i'm debugging the launcher, i don't see how that step can be skipped
2011-04-21T03:00:08  *** amitev has joined #selenium
2011-04-21T03:04:48  <AutomatedTester> freynaud: only way we can skip the -silent step is to make a user.js like Firefox would
2011-04-21T03:05:42  <freynaud> i was talking about the bug you mentioned
2011-04-21T03:05:49  <freynaud> that jimevans found
2011-04-21T03:05:56  <AutomatedTester> oh...
2011-04-21T03:06:14  <freynaud> there is no condition or anything in the remotedriver
2011-04-21T03:06:28  <AutomatedTester> he hasnt looked at the code, he just said that it appears as remotewebdriver isnt running that step
2011-04-21T03:06:29  <freynaud> it goes through the launch with -silent first
2011-04-21T03:06:41  <AutomatedTester> after creating the new profile?
2011-04-21T03:07:49  <AutomatedTester> if thats the case its probably best to ask jimevans
2011-04-21T03:10:32  <jarib> yeah, i thinks it's impossible to get firefox launched without the -silent step
2011-04-21T03:10:52  <jarib> unless some of the Se1 launcher code is involved..
2011-04-21T03:11:04  <freynaud> even if for some bizare reason the clean step crashes
2011-04-21T03:11:11  <freynaud> firefox wouldn't start at all
2011-04-21T03:11:24  <freynaud> it wouldn't start without the correct pofile
2011-04-21T03:11:26  <jarib> right
2011-04-21T03:11:43  *** ollikuhta has quit IRC
2011-04-21T03:11:53  <AutomatedTester> i dont know then
2011-04-21T03:13:37  <freynaud> for the lucky ones who have to test windows desktop application on top of web sites, you can have a look at http://code.google.com/p/twin/ and let me know what you think
2011-04-21T03:14:07  <freynaud> it's using the web driver JSON protocol, so you can use it in grid2
2011-04-21T03:15:38  <AutomatedTester> wow, ebay is finally joining the OSS revolution
2011-04-21T03:16:23  <freynaud> wasn't easy :)
2011-04-21T03:17:52  <freynaud> twin can be used in combination with webdriver to do fancy things
2011-04-21T03:17:58  <freynaud> if you're using FF on windows
2011-04-21T03:17:59  <AutomatedTester> from speaking to Dees, getting anything in ebay done is like drawing blood from a stone
2011-04-21T03:18:15  <freynaud> you can launch twin and atyach to the process webdriver controls
2011-04-21T03:18:43  <freynaud> and interact with the print menu and all that stuff for instance
2011-04-21T03:19:23  <freynaud> you need to master ppt to have things done :)
2011-04-21T03:19:35  <AutomatedTester> hehe
2011-04-21T03:20:17  <jarib> sounds like twin needs a ruby client :)
2011-04-21T03:21:19  <freynaud> it needs a .NET one
2011-04-21T03:21:46  <freynaud> kind of hard to explain to a .NET shop they should write test in ava
2011-04-21T03:22:19  <freynaud> but if you're up for a ruby client , plz write it  :)
2011-04-21T03:22:50  <freynaud> the part i'm not sure about is the client interfaces
2011-04-21T03:23:07  <freynaud> at the moment, they map to the MS UIAutomation one
2011-04-21T03:23:43  <freynaud> the question is : should it use twin.findElement(By) instead or twin.getDescendant / child
2011-04-21T03:24:25  <freynaud> the overall concept is similar to webdriver, so big peices could be reuse. Find stuff, click stuff
2011-04-21T03:24:38  <freynaud> but not sure how to leverage the other MS specific parts
2011-04-21T03:33:09  <AutomatedTester> btw, I think I found a bug in Fx5
2011-04-21T03:33:20  <AutomatedTester> which means Selenium/Webdriver wont work
2011-04-21T03:35:14  <freynaud> if only we knew someone @mozilla :) we could have it fixed =
2011-04-21T03:37:22  <AutomatedTester> freynaud: just checking the expected behaviour hasnt changed before fixing/raising a bug
2011-04-21T03:37:29  <freynaud> :p

2011-04-21T05:01:21  <jarib> probably none
2011-04-21T05:01:32  <adamgoucher> you'll want to farm it out to another vm rather than the host

2011-04-21T06:24:52  <selbot> New news from builds: IDE-MOZMILL-8 was SUCCESSFUL : Manual build by Dave Hunt <http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/IDE-MOZMILL-8>
2011-04-21T06:25:27  <davehunt> ^^ now results are reported to http://mozmill-crowd.brasstacks.mozilla.com/#/addons/reports
2011-04-21T06:26:05  <adamgoucher> ironically, se-ide isnt in amo :)
2011-04-21T06:26:35  <adamgoucher> i think se-ide 2.0 should be a merge of se-ide and mozmill
2011-04-21T06:26:48  <adamgoucher> and then hand it off to moz to support :P
2011-04-21T06:26:56  <davehunt> You mean Mozmill IDE?
2011-04-21T06:27:25  <adamgoucher> sure. that way you could control the browser, and the browser content
2011-04-21T06:27:54  <davehunt> Mozmill can already do that
2011-04-21T06:29:55  <adamgoucher> so other than a syntax worse than even selenium's why isn't everyone all over it?
2011-04-21T06:34:59  <davehunt> partly people don't know about it, partly the syntax
2011-04-21T06:35:20  <davehunt> also the general purpose isn't for testing content, even though it can
2011-04-21T06:35:28  <davehunt> Selenium is far better suited to that
2011-04-21T06:35:46  <davehunt> Hopefully a new FirefoxDriver will provide the best of both worlds
2011-04-21T06:36:44  <davehunt> Another big part of it is that you can only write tests in JavaScript, and there's no ability to use xUnit type frameworks

2011-04-21T06:50:09  <AutomatedTester> old docs?
2011-04-21T06:52:50  <ousado> some docs are not very specific about which binaries to download, and if they actually name the files, those seem to be obsolete, webdriver-all.zip for example

2011-04-21T06:57:23  <AutomatedTester> at the top of that page it is a lot clearer
2011-04-21T06:57:30  <ousado> ya, looks like it, pretty hard to decide right from wrong here
2011-04-21T06:57:43  <AutomatedTester> did you try it from the top
2011-04-21T07:02:22  <davehunt> adamgoucher: We may need to get Bamboo to publish the latest Selenium IDE artefacts somewhere with a consistent name (like selenium-editor-snapshot.xpi) in order for the Mozmill tests to run agains it
2011-04-21T07:02:57  <adamgoucher> isnt there a 'latest' url alias somewhere
2011-04-21T07:03:31  <davehunt> that doesn't redirect to the artefact
2011-04-21T07:03:50  <davehunt> unless you know of some magic URL :)
2011-04-21T07:04:23  <ousado> heh, well now that you say those are a lot clearer (and you say that it's the selenium-XXX.jar, which is something the docs don't mention), I'll probably have no further problems.

2011-04-21T07:07:42  <mattp_> should webdriver 2.* be a dropin replacement for 1.* selenium rc? (ie should a perl module for selenium 1.* theoretically work with webdriver doing backward emulation?)
2011-04-21T07:10:10  <adamgoucher> http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/IDE-EDITOR/latest/artifact/Selenium-IDE-Editor/selenium-ide.xpi 'should' work -- unless that was a 3.x change

2011-04-21T07:16:03  <jarib> i suspect it's changed in 3.0 though..
2011-04-21T07:16:19  <davehunt> unfortunately there are going to be a few hurdles to get this to run
2011-04-21T07:16:34  <davehunt> alternatively, we wait for Mozmill 2.0, and it should be simpler
2011-04-21T07:16:46  <adamgoucher> right. ide-editor is the plan. ide-editor-job1 is the 'default job'

2011-04-21T09:54:20  <xirkus> freynaud: to run tests concurrently in Grid, do you have to specify multiple test classes, or can you have a single test class with multiple tests?
2011-04-21T09:55:43  <freynaud> the way you structure your test doesnt impact grid
2011-04-21T09:56:01  <freynaud> if you have you tests running in parallel, grid will execute them in parallel
2011-04-21T09:56:16  <freynaud> if you send them 1 after the other, grid will run them sequentially
2011-04-21T09:56:38  <freynaud> what are you using to run your tests ?

2011-04-21T09:57:47  <xirkus> that's good to know. I'm using the JUnit runScheduled to run tests in parallell. I was just wondering if this was OK for grid without modifications.
2011-04-21T09:58:54  <ian_mac_> should be
2011-04-21T10:00:24  <freynaud> as long as you make sure your tests are not sharing resources
2011-04-21T10:00:44  <freynaud> you need to be sure that WebDriver driver is unique per test
2011-04-21T10:03:07  <xirkus> freynaud: I created a framework that encapsulates a RemoteWebDriver instance to make it effectively thread-safe.
2011-04-21T10:05:28  <freynaud> i don't know JUnit. If it always assign a unique thread per test method, then you're good :)

2011-04-21T11:06:27  <AutomatedTester> we do it at Mozilla
2011-04-21T11:08:55  *** zmijunkie has quit IRC
2011-04-21T11:12:50  <RossPatterson> AT: Yeah, Planet seems to be the way to go for anything worthwhile.  And I don't think it requires much care and feeding.  Although it appears I might find out :-)

2011-04-21T11:49:42  <miker2> Is there a straight-forward way of testing JavaScript changes to the Firefox driver?
2011-04-21T11:51:16  <miker2> I have the source locally and have the project setup in eclipse.  I added some dummy logging to verify my setup was correct but don't see the output when I run the tests.

2011-04-21T12:03:39  <antlong> will buy a beer for anyone who helps :D
2011-04-21T12:09:05  <andytinkham> antlong: I'm around but know nothing about captureNetworkTraffic. Can I still have a beer?
2011-04-21T12:09:16  <antlong> sadly not
2011-04-21T12:09:26  <andytinkham> *sigh*
2011-04-21T12:10:03  <RossPatterson> Se 1 or 2?
2011-04-21T12:10:18  <antlong> 1
2011-04-21T12:11:25  <RossPatterson> I'm not *cough* intimate with it, but I know a little sumpin sumpin.  Whaddaya need?
2011-04-21T12:12:16  <antlong> ha
2011-04-21T12:12:33  <antlong> so using 'json' its capturing quite a bit, except for what i REALLY need it to capture
2011-04-21T12:12:53  <antlong> which are two POSTs that are made when the page loads
2011-04-21T12:12:57  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-04-21T12:13:25  <RossPatterson> Are you sure the POSTs go though the RC proxy?  You can find them in the Jetty log?
2011-04-21T12:13:52  <antlong> let me check
2011-04-21T12:19:46  <antlong> hmn
2011-04-21T12:20:18  <antlong> im seeing rpc's now, but it doesnt seem like its updating when i change pages
2011-04-21T12:20:27  <RossPatterson> I ask because RC starts recording during the getNewBrowserSession command, so they oughta be there.
2011-04-21T12:20:55  <antlong> i see one from the first page i hit, i open() another page, and i should then see two
2011-04-21T12:23:05  <antlong> it might be a timing issue
2011-04-21T12:24:11  <RossPatterson> Anything handled by the proxy should show up in the network traffic results.  The collected traffic is only discarded by the getNewBrowserSession and captureNetworkTraffic commands.

2011-04-21T14:44:53  <nirvdrum> As well as non-grid does.
2011-04-21T14:45:11  <nirvdrum> All grid does is delegate to the selenium driver.
