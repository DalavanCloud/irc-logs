2011-04-11T01:33:09  <madteckhead_1> G'day folks, popping in with a question I can't find a solution too. Really happy with the new webdriver stuff, just can't work out how to wait for an element OR even just delay for a set period using the python bindings. Have others come up with a solution for this?
2011-04-11T01:33:27  <jarib> ato: thanks to you too!
2011-04-11T01:34:52  <jarib> madteckhead_1: not sure what it looks like in python, but you could either wait explicitly (recommended), or configure an implicit wait
2011-04-11T01:35:28  <jarib> in java/ruby/.net we have helpers for doing explicit waiting (WebDriverWait in java, Selenium::WebDriver::Wait in Ruby)
2011-04-11T01:35:42  <jarib> either way setting up explicit waiting is pretty simple
2011-04-11T01:36:03  <madteckhead_1> yeah, i can't figure out how .... ahhh.... i just realised waiting has nothing to do with selenium does it
2011-04-11T01:36:12  <madteckhead_1> just something like pause(10)

2011-04-11T01:36:40  <jarib> you really should avoid sleep() or pause() calls
2011-04-11T01:37:02  <madteckhead_1> o really, so how to wait explicitly?
2011-04-11T01:37:22  <jarib> poll the DOM for the state you want (with a timeout)
2011-04-11T01:37:39  <madteckhead_1> okay, thanks.
2011-04-11T01:38:05  <jarib> i.e. something like   wait_until { driver.find_element(...) }

2011-04-11T02:27:45  <mashiara> some sort of "page loaded" callback would be nice (in thise case I'm writing an interaction class for a CMS toolbar and of course I need to re-init my toolbar class each time the page is changed for whatever reason)
2011-04-11T02:28:24  <jarib> mashiara: the problem with that is that what is considered "loaded" depends on context

2011-04-11T02:29:16  <mashiara> driver.get() is kinda obvious, and easy to wrap
2011-04-11T02:29:23  <jarib> webdriver tries to block as best as possible, but at some point it needs to throw up its hands and let you as the author/tester deal with it
2011-04-11T02:29:38  <mashiara> but clicking on links and form controls gets complicated.
2011-04-11T02:29:48  <jarib> get() can be complicated as well
2011-04-11T02:30:07  <jarib> consider onload='setTimeout(...)' etc
2011-04-11T02:30:19  <jarib> the whole UI could potentially be built there.
2011-04-11T02:30:28  <jarib> i think webdriver strikes the right balance at the moment.
2011-04-11T02:30:52  <mashiara> yes, let me rephrase: I would like to be able to define a callback to be called just before get or click returns
2011-04-11T02:31:09  <mashiara> I'm happy so far with the magic that happens inside the methods
2011-04-11T02:32:01  <mashiara> but the click callback (if defined for "page load") should only be called if a page was loaded as far as webdriver core is concerned
2011-04-11T02:32:09  <mashiara> (now it got complicated...)
2011-04-11T02:32:40  <mashiara> I can deal with this manually easily but it would make my test code cleaner if I didn't have to add so much boilerplate

2011-04-11T02:40:21  <jarib> mashiara: not sure how a callback would make sense in webdriver, since it's a blocking api

2011-04-11T02:40:57  <jarib> and your test code can be as clean as you want, if you build the right abstractions :)
2011-04-11T02:41:08  <jarib> e.g. page objects

2011-04-11T02:41:55  <mashiara> "hook" then :) mainly making a wrapper for the click method to determine if this particular click caused a "page load" or not might be a bit complex.
2011-04-11T02:42:28  <mokki> hi, is there any way to debug what happens in the browser side when selenium exequtes a request? I have enabled httpclient debug which shows that the FirefoxDriver sends a "GET /hub/session/379f6f79-4d1e-40ac-9460-234233b291f3/element/%7B112d0de0-39b9-4707-b085-1346fd3a9b89%7D/enabled HTTP/1.1" request but never receives any reponse from the browser - this is very repeatable
2011-04-11T02:42:31  <mashiara> while at the pie-in-the-sky department: callback/signal/hook for when server explicitly deletes cookie would be nice
2011-04-11T02:44:38  <mashiara> (I have a system for "persisting" select cookies across invidual tests, again I can manually check if they're still valid but...)
2011-04-11T02:45:47  *** lfryc_away is now known as lfryc
2011-04-11T02:46:35  <jarib> persisting cookies across tests sounds like asking for trouble
2011-04-11T02:46:53  <jarib> each test should be self-contained
2011-04-11T02:47:01  <mashiara> it's just the login session cookies
2011-04-11T02:49:20  <mashiara> in this case the logins go through Shibboleth so it's a nontrivial amount of time to do it for each test separately.
2011-04-11T02:49:37  <mashiara> anyways, now lunch. thanks for the insinghts

2011-04-11T02:51:49  <HolyGoat> I'm a bit confused. I've seen a number of messages on newsgroups stating that selenium does not support tests that go over multiple domains, yet when I create a test that goes over e.g. login.foo.com to www.foo.com , it succeeds (without running Selenium RC in proxy injection mode explicitly)
2011-04-11T02:52:07  <HolyGoat> am I missing something, or does Selenium RC support this transparently now?

2011-04-11T05:21:16  <jarib> mashiara: webdriver falls back to sizzle if the native querySelector API isn't available

2011-04-11T05:22:00  <jarib> mashiara: which means locating by css isn't entirely consistent
2011-04-11T05:22:35  <jarib> if you don't rely on sizzle's CSS extensions, you should be good though
2011-04-11T05:22:41  <ato> krosenvold, jarib: I've noticed that we have quite a few developers and users of Selenium/Watir in the Oslo-region now, would you be interested in maybe doing some sort of meetup sometime?

2011-04-11T05:23:10  <mashiara> jarib: ok, does the native querySelector support the super-handy extended things Sizzle has ? because I seem to get all kinds of "invalid string in selector" -style errors when I try to use them...

2011-04-11T05:30:10  <ato> We've implemented it as findElementByCss, so I guess this is different from exposing querySelector.

2011-04-11T05:33:44  <ato> So whenever you use a browser that hasn't implemented querySelector yet, how does Sizzle plug into this?
2011-04-11T05:33:57  <jarib> it injects sizzle to provide css support.
2011-04-11T05:35:01  <jarib> mashiara: the main argument against is speed (injecting sizzle when it's not needed)
2011-04-11T05:36:02  <mashiara> optional enable_sizzle() method ?
2011-04-11T05:36:13  <jarib> mashiara: if your app uses jquery (which is the case for most people asking about this), you can always do driver.execute_script("return $(selector).get(0)")
2011-04-11T05:37:05  <jarib> mashiara: not going to happen. we'd like to keep the api as small as possible
2011-04-11T05:37:28  <jarib> and an enable_sizzle method would be very specific to this point in time
2011-04-11T05:37:53  <mashiara> jarib; ok, and the execute_script workaround is good enough
2011-04-11T05:38:02  <jarib> aye :)
2011-04-11T05:38:56  <mashiara> I just need to write a wrapper that falls back to that in case I get the funky exception I get when trying to use Sizzle selectors where they're not available
2011-04-11T05:40:22  <HolyGoat> I really hope the company I work for lets me open source the stuff I wrote with SeleniumRC. It spits out useful stuff to Nagios (like benchmarking relevant calls, correctly dealing with asserts that fail etc)
2011-04-11T05:42:46  <ato> Which browsers do still not support querySelector?
2011-04-11T05:44:34  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-04-11T05:45:29  <jimevans> ato: In the latest versions of the browser? None that I know of. But as long as we're supporting IE6 and IE7, we'll need to keep Sizzle around.
2011-04-11T05:46:01  <ato> Of course, that makes sense.
2011-04-11T05:46:15  <ato> My question was more in the category of general curiosity (-:
2011-04-11T05:46:24  <jimevans> :)
2011-04-11T05:47:12  <jimevans> general question: Outside of IE and Firefox, who supports showModalDialog()?
2011-04-11T05:49:12  <selbot2> james.h.evans.jr less than 10 seconds ago - JimEvans: IE native code should no longer hang when presented with a window created by showModalDialog(). - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11972
2011-04-11T05:50:32  <ato> jimevans: We don't yet, but it's in the pipeline.
2011-04-11T05:50:45  <ato> jimevans: It's pretty far down on the priority list, though.
2011-04-11T05:51:50  * ato comments on that bug in the BTS.
2011-04-11T05:52:14  <ato> jimevans: In which part of WebDriver is that used?
2011-04-11T05:52:57  <jimevans> ato: It's not, at least not yet (#284). showModalDialog presents a weird case for the WebDriver API.
2011-04-11T05:53:05  <ato> jimevans: Interesting.  It's filed as the 118th bug in Opera (=

2011-04-11T05:54:41  <jimevans> At any rate, someone pinged me offline about wanting to fix it for IE, and I started digging around with it at SeConf.
2011-04-11T05:54:59  <jimevans> For IE, it's not a simple fix.
2011-04-11T05:54:59  <ato> That's an awesome feature, actually.
2011-04-11T05:55:33  <jimevans> But it brings up an interesting question about the WebDriver API. Do we handle it as a regular window, or do we handle it as an alert?
2011-04-11T05:55:35  <ato> I think part of the problem is that showModalDialog is very underspecified, however.
2011-04-11T05:55:47  *** SL-BWood has joined #selenium
2011-04-11T05:56:11  <ato> Window would make sense.
2011-04-11T05:56:13  <jimevans> ato: Well, sure. It started life as an IE-only thing.
2011-04-11T05:56:47  <ato> But then there's the question of whether a window could have a return value…
2011-04-11T05:56:47  <jimevans> Handling it as a window makes sense to me too, but I thought I'd bring it up anyway.
2011-04-11T05:56:48  <ato> Heh.
2011-04-11T05:57:02  <jarib> ato: well, don't want http://blah/#241 to trigger it

2011-04-11T06:38:50  <jimevans> Stuk: no, that's correct. the string for launching firefox is "*chrome"
2011-04-11T06:38:51  <jarib> Stuk: it's a Selenium 1 thing
2011-04-11T06:39:08  <jarib> Stuk: nothing to do with the webdriver world
2011-04-11T06:39:15  <Stuk> ahhh, okey then
2011-04-11T06:39:16  <mashiara> can I refer to a webelement  via it's Selenium id (webelement.id property) in driver.execute_script() somehow ?
2011-04-11T06:39:18  <adamgoucher> and chrome is a mozilla thing
2011-04-11T06:39:30  <jimevans> historical note: the firefox string existed before the google chrome browser did.
2011-04-11T06:39:46  <Stuk> I'm trying to work out how I can easily run the selenium tests against Opera Driver
2011-04-11T06:39:55  <jarib> mashiara: you can pass in the element; driver.execute_script("return typeof arguments[0]", webelement)
2011-04-11T06:41:04  <mashiara> jarib: ok thanks, btw is there a good documentation on all of this somewhere that I should read before asking stupid questions ?

2011-04-11T07:21:36  <jarib> at least in my mind
2011-04-11T07:21:57  <Stuk> yep, that sounds right jarib

2011-04-11T07:22:28  <AutomatedTester> but with the python stuff its easy to add a commandline arg

2011-04-11T07:41:58  <simonstewart> I think IE is the only browser that actually makes them modal
2011-04-11T07:42:17  <jimevans> Probably so.
2011-04-11T07:42:38  <jimevans> I asked earlier if the Firefox driver supported them

2011-04-11T07:44:41  <jimevans> Making them work in IE is going to involve a fairly intrusive refactor.

2011-04-11T07:45:00  <simonstewart> That they block the calling thread?
2011-04-11T07:45:31  <jimevans> The major issue is that the modal dialog window isn't an IWebBrowser2.
2011-04-11T07:45:46  <simonstewart> Ah. Does it have no IHTMLDocument at all?
2011-04-11T07:45:56  <jimevans> Consequently, it doesn't sink the events for IWebBrowser2.
2011-04-11T07:46:04  <jimevans> Oh, it has a document.
2011-04-11T07:46:36  <simonstewart> Well, that's a start
2011-04-11T07:46:42  <simonstewart> How are people using these things?
2011-04-11T07:46:46  <jimevans> And I can get to the document, but several of the ways we manage the browser won't work because we don't get an OnQuit event.

2011-04-11T08:01:32  <QAguy> Yea I was thinking that.

2011-04-11T08:16:52  <QAguy> jarib: that's so funny I was just emailing you that question.

2011-04-11T08:17:03  <QAguy> Ok doing that now
2011-04-11T08:17:04  <QAguy> thanks
2011-04-11T08:17:37  <jarib> the reason it's --pre is because we haven't entirely figured out how to do proper shutdown, so you may need to watch for zombie chromedriver processes (especially if your scripts don't call driver.quit())
2011-04-11T08:17:59  <jarib> well, not really zombie processes, but you get what i mean

2011-04-11T09:20:37  <jimevans> want opinions. if you read the backlog above, you'll see i'm working on windows created by showModalDialog().
2011-04-11T09:21:17  <jimevans> The window used for regular browsing, and the window used for hosting an html dialog are descended from the same base class.
2011-04-11T09:21:36  <jimevans> What do I call the base class (the subclasses are "Browser" and "HtmlDialog", at the moment).
2011-04-11T09:22:41  * jimevans is usually pretty good at the whole "figuring out what to name stuff", but is drawing a blank on this one.

2011-04-11T09:28:47  <simonstewart> Thank you!
2011-04-11T09:28:49  <jimevans> simonstewart: well, it's not *technically* abstract, because it does include some common implementation, but i guess that's as good as any. :)
2011-04-11T09:28:59  <simonstewart> BaseBrowser?
2011-04-11T09:29:15  <jimevans> i was using BrowserBase to begin with.
2011-04-11T09:29:38  <simonstewart> IBrowser?
2011-04-11T09:29:57  <jimevans> but using classes with *Base* and *Abstract* feel hacky to me.
2011-04-11T09:30:36  <simonstewart> OK. So, this is the main "interface" we use throughout the code
2011-04-11T09:30:40  <simonstewart> With two specializations?
2011-04-11T09:30:53  <jimevans> yeah, pretty much.
2011-04-11T09:30:58  <simonstewart> In that case, "abstract" or "base" ain't right
2011-04-11T09:31:08  <simonstewart> We should name it after the central concept it represents
2011-04-11T09:31:19  <simonstewart> "Driver", perhaps. Or "Window"?
2011-04-11T09:31:28  <jimevans> I was leaning toward
2011-04-11T09:31:45  *** towski has joined #selenium
2011-04-11T09:31:54  <jimevans> Window, but that lends itself to "WindowHandle" for the smart-pointer typedef of it which is an overloaded term.

2011-04-11T09:32:32  <jimevans> Now we're getting somewhere. That has possibilities.
2011-04-11T09:33:11  <simonstewart> DrivenBrowser?
2011-04-11T09:33:38  <jimevans> Maybe the "most-of-the-time-used" class (currently called "Browser") is wrong.
2011-04-11T09:33:49  <simonstewart> Quite possibly
2011-04-11T09:35:28  <simonstewart> When I did the original work on the C++ code I was concentrating more on getting things working
2011-04-11T09:35:40  <simonstewart> It's unlikely I got the names right
2011-04-11T09:36:19  <jimevans> Oh, taking a cue from the IE COM interfaces, the base is an HtmlWindow, which can be a Browser or an HtmlDialog.

2011-04-11T11:35:01  <AutomatedTester> cgoldberg: i forgot to mention, I verified that python 2.7 works with Selenium
2011-04-11T11:35:12  <AutomatedTester> only 1 test failed
2011-04-11T11:36:06  <jarib> jezozwierzak: looks like htmlunit is choking on your JS (the syntax error), so it's either a bug in htmlunit or your code
2011-04-11T11:37:22  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, sweet
2011-04-11T11:37:48  <jezozwierzak> It is trown while making new object of htmlunit, so I don't do anything complicated
2011-04-11T11:37:58  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, so just to verify.. with the newer Python bindings, if I use the webdriver API, it no longer uses the Java server to drive tests?
2011-04-11T11:38:09  <AutomatedTester> yup
2011-04-11T11:38:16  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, noyce
2011-04-11T11:38:32  <AutomatedTester> got the bindings installed?
2011-04-11T11:38:37  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, i just upgraded that framework to use webdriver.. its working great
2011-04-11T11:38:44  <AutomatedTester> sweet
2011-04-11T11:38:58  <AutomatedTester> i use the Java server for remote stuff
2011-04-11T11:39:08  <AutomatedTester> but if its on my machine I bind directly
2011-04-11T11:39:10  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, i'm pip installing the 2.0b3 bindings (which i then need to comment out that line in before usable)
2011-04-11T11:39:49  <AutomatedTester> well just doing driver = webdriver.Firefox() should start the browser
2011-04-11T11:40:01  <AutomatedTester> except for when I forget to checkin something
2011-04-11T11:40:10  <AutomatedTester> stupid multiplatform support :P
2011-04-11T11:40:30  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, lol.. yea.. its ok.. i just comment out that line for now
2011-04-11T11:41:39  <AutomatedTester> i finished the chrome drive rewrite and that I verified worked on each platform with clean checkouts so this shouldnt happen again
2011-04-11T11:42:24  <AutomatedTester> jarib/ato: I cant use jython for opera bindings
2011-04-11T11:42:56  <AutomatedTester> so protobuf is going to become my new friend
2011-04-11T11:43:49  <jarib> what's the jython problem?
2011-04-11T11:44:07  <AutomatedTester> jython doesnt like some of the python ways I did thing
2011-04-11T11:44:18  <jarib> i see
2011-04-11T11:44:28  <AutomatedTester> so either I go through and change the approach
2011-04-11T11:44:35  *** andytinkham has joined #selenium
2011-04-11T11:44:45  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: i'm going to be doing the same thing for .net's operadriver. someday.
2011-04-11T11:44:46  <jarib> the problem with doing the protobuf stuff is that the .proto files aren't included in operadriver
2011-04-11T11:44:52  <jarib> just the generated java code
2011-04-11T11:44:57  <jarib> we should probably make them fix that
2011-04-11T11:45:09  <jimevans> ato: yeah, can we get the .proto files available?
2011-04-11T11:45:21  <jarib> Stuk: possible to get the .proto files added to the operadriver repo?
2011-04-11T11:45:24  *** ivog has joined #selenium
2011-04-11T11:45:27  <AutomatedTester> to work or ato gets it working with JSON over the wire
2011-04-11T11:45:37  <AutomatedTester> i vote for the latter
2011-04-11T11:45:38  <jarib> jimevans: Stuk is the guy maintaining the webdriver bits
2011-04-11T11:45:56  <jimevans> jarib: thanks.
2011-04-11T11:46:05  <jarib> AutomatedTester: as soon as they push what they have internally it will work with the java server
2011-04-11T11:46:16  <jarib> it's all set up on our side
2011-04-11T11:46:31  <AutomatedTester> Stuk: can you implement JSON over the wire and then have an executable that does the protobuf stuff
2011-04-11T11:46:53  <AutomatedTester> jarib: the python community loves the tight binding so wanna try support that
2011-04-11T11:48:20  <AutomatedTester> but if I cant, I cant
2011-04-11T11:48:22  <jarib> sure, i've argued this as well
2011-04-11T11:48:45  <jarib> the only difference is that the server is in java instead of c though :)
2011-04-11T11:49:44  <keshureddyp1> any one experienced issues with selenium rc 1.0.3 on  ff4?
2011-04-11T11:50:04  <ygerasimov> good evening gents. Can anyone assist how to set up headers of the browser that runs?
2011-04-11T11:50:23  <ygerasimov> I need to set User Agent property badly
2011-04-11T11:50:36  <jarib> AutomatedTester: convincing opera to re-implement their scope stuff in c/c++ just because we don't like java isn't super realistic
2011-04-11T11:51:00  <jarib> although i do share your sentiment here :)
2011-04-11T11:51:06  <AutomatedTester> jarib: I dont mind them doing it java
2011-04-11T11:51:21  <jimevans> AutomatedTester, jarib: I do. :)
2011-04-11T11:51:31  <jimevans> no, really, i don't.
2011-04-11T11:51:52  <jimevans> I'd just like to be able to run single-language stacks where possible.
2011-04-11T11:51:54  <AutomatedTester> the chrome way is the most amout of work I want to do to make it work
2011-04-11T11:52:07  <AutomatedTester> which I guess I could do
2011-04-11T11:52:32  <AutomatedTester> but the current javaserver is a little bloated
2011-04-11T11:52:36  <jarib> right, none of us doe a LocalRemoteDriver atm :)
2011-04-11T11:52:52  <jarib> shouldn't be hard to do a webdriver-only server
2011-04-11T11:52:55  <jarib> *too
2011-04-11T11:53:39  <jimevans> i did a .NET implementation of a webdriver-only server.
2011-04-11T11:53:44  <jarib> uhm, not *too :P
2011-04-11T11:54:00  *** csanchez has joined #selenium
2011-04-11T11:54:03  <jimevans> it wasn't that tough.
2011-04-11T11:54:07  <jarib> you have a .NET remote server implementation?
2011-04-11T11:54:44  <jarib> what i meant is we could do a build rule that builds the java server without the Se1 bits
2011-04-11T11:54:46  <jimevans> jarib: yes. it's out of date, but wouldn't need too much to bring it into line with the current wire protocol
2011-04-11T11:54:55  <jarib> cool
2011-04-11T11:55:10  <jimevans> http://code.google.com/p/strontium
2011-04-11T11:56:05  <QAguy> fyi... the new chrome driver is FAST!
2011-04-11T11:57:55  <jarib> at least perceived performance :)
2011-04-11T11:58:16  <jarib> i've yet to see benchmarks where it outperforms the firefox driver
2011-04-11T11:58:22  <keshureddyp1> (11:56:57 AM) keshureddyp1: any one experienced issues with selenium rc 1.0.3 on  ff4?
2011-04-11T11:58:39  <jarib> keshureddyp1: yes, you need to move to the 2.0 betas
2011-04-11T11:58:42  <keshureddyp1> my tests are just blocking
2011-04-11T11:58:50  <jarib> latest one has a bunch of fixes for Fx4
2011-04-11T11:58:55  <keshureddyp1> thank you
2011-04-11T11:58:56  *** jezozwierzak has quit IRC
2011-04-11T11:59:07  <ivog> Hi, could it be that there are problems with building using go.bat on win7 64?
2011-04-11T11:59:18  <jimevans> ivog: like what?
2011-04-11T11:59:29  <ivog> the build aborts on firefox tests
2011-04-11T11:59:41  <ivog> alot of ff tests work but at some point it aborts
2011-04-11T11:59:49  <jimevans> building java?
2011-04-11T11:59:51  <ivog> also go.bat release doesn't seem to work
2011-04-11T11:59:52  <QAguy> jarib: true. But I do perceive it to be smoking fast. ;)
2011-04-11T12:00:14  <ivog> just building everything using just go.bat
2011-04-11T12:00:37  <ivog> building seems to go fine, runnign the firefox tests breaks at some point
2011-04-11T12:01:04  <jimevans> ivog: the build is set up to run the java tests by default. however, the java tests are also set to abort on the first test failure.
2011-04-11T12:01:17  *** toseter has joined #selenium
2011-04-11T12:01:29  <jarib> QAguy: perceived performance is important too :)
2011-04-11T12:02:16  <jimevans> ivog: last time i tried it, there was at least one firefox failure that i knew of. where does it fail?
2011-04-11T12:02:16  <jarib> ivog: running `./go log=true` should give you more output
2011-04-11T12:02:58  <ivog> jimevans: let me have another look at the buildlog file
2011-04-11T12:03:00  <jimevans> ivog: there's also a log file in build\test_logs, which you can look at.
2011-04-11T12:03:54  <ivog> jimevans: so basically im trying to build the binaries so that i can try out the current state of grid
2011-04-11T12:04:10  <ivog> jimevans: what target can i use to get the needed binaries
2011-04-11T12:07:50  <jimevans> ivog: well to build grid itself, "go //java/server/src/org/openqa/grid" should get the grid binaries.
2011-04-11T12:09:36  <AutomatedTester> jarib: i have been getting people in platform excited about a firefox driver
2011-04-11T12:09:48  <ivog> jimevans: ok but thats a non packaged version right? isn't it integrated in the server right now?
2011-04-11T12:09:49  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-04-11T12:10:09  <jarib> AutomatedTester: that sounds awesome if platform is a group at moz :)
2011-04-11T12:10:26  <jimevans> ivog: not yet, as far as I know, though I could be wrong. the new grid is still pretty new.
2011-04-11T12:10:30  <AutomatedTester> platform is the group that makes firefox for desktop and mobile
2011-04-11T12:10:46  <jarib> cool
2011-04-11T12:11:48  <jarib> so when simon puts "mozilla is on board" in his standardization slides it doesn't just mean "we have a mozillan on the team" anymore? :)
2011-04-11T12:12:06  <AutomatedTester> but the client-side code for firefoxdriver looks like it will integrated to a few things
2011-04-11T12:12:11  <ivog> jimevans: ok i'll have a look, looks like testSendingKeysToAFocusedElementShouldNotBlurThatElement is failing
2011-04-11T12:12:20  <AutomatedTester> internal projects
2011-04-11T12:12:28  <jarib> great
2011-04-11T12:12:43  <AutomatedTester> i mean the python client-side stuff
2011-04-11T12:13:03  <jarib> right
2011-04-11T12:13:37  <AutomatedTester> but means that we will be dogfooding both sides
2011-04-11T12:13:47  <AutomatedTester> and then we just need to manage the other languages
2011-04-11T12:13:56  <jimevans> ivog: ok good to know where it's failing. i'm not normally a java guy, so i'm not sure how much help i'll be going forward.
2011-04-11T12:15:39  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester:  how would i suppress "*** LOG addons.xpi:"  messages?
2011-04-11T12:15:40  <jarib> AutomatedTester: but not yet any concrete plans to move the actual driver out of our tree, right?
2011-04-11T12:16:11  <AutomatedTester> no concrete plans but its coming
2011-04-11T12:16:35  <AutomatedTester> cgoldberg: is that when doing driver = webdriver.Firefox()?
2011-04-11T12:16:39  <jarib> if you start using the client internally i guess it's just a matter of time :)
2011-04-11T12:16:44  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, yes
2011-04-11T12:17:03  <ivog> jimevans: ok i'll have a look, do you ever use go release for building the release bits? i get a filenotfound exception on during Zip: //java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium:client-combined:zip
2011-04-11T12:17:17  <AutomatedTester> cgoldberg: this using the one on pypi or from trunk
2011-04-11T12:17:25  <AutomatedTester> I ask because I thought i fixed that in trunk
2011-04-11T12:17:30  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, 2.0b3 from PyPi
2011-04-11T12:17:44  <jimevans> ivog: i never build the java release bits. i work almost exclusively on the .net bindings.
2011-04-11T12:17:55  <jimevans> well, almost never.
2011-04-11T12:17:59  <jimevans> not in awhile anyway.
2011-04-11T12:18:12  <ivog> ok
2011-04-11T12:18:53  <AutomatedTester> cgoldberg: it should look like http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/firefox_binary.py#64
2011-04-11T12:19:21  <ivog> sorry for the load of questions im trying to find my way around this project :)
2011-04-11T12:19:39  <AutomatedTester> since I dont really care about the output I just PIPE it
2011-04-11T12:19:55  <jimevans> ivog: it's understandable; the project is pretty complex.
2011-04-11T12:22:00  <jarib> AutomatedTester, jimevans: do you shut down the chrome server on exit?
2011-04-11T12:22:05  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, nice.. i'm trying it now and its working great
2011-04-11T12:22:28  <AutomatedTester> i should really release a new version
2011-04-11T12:22:30  <jarib> the scenario where people don't call quit() is the only thing that's preventing me from pushing a release for real.
2011-04-11T12:22:46  *** santiycr has quit IRC
2011-04-11T12:22:54  <AutomatedTester> jarib: do we care?
2011-04-11T12:23:03  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, an updated version on PyPI would be awesome.  is that feasible soon?
2011-04-11T12:23:21  <jarib> AutomatedTester: yes, because we'll leave a bunch of chromedriver processes running
2011-04-11T12:23:43  <jarib> and it's pretty common for people to don't call quit() if they want to debug why their tests fail
2011-04-11T12:23:43  <AutomatedTester> but if people dont call quit() in firefox and Ie we leave them open
2011-04-11T12:24:07  <jarib> right, but that tears down the server when you manually close the browser (since it's the same process)
2011-04-11T12:24:17  <AutomatedTester> ahh I get you
2011-04-11T12:24:45  <AutomatedTester> cgoldberg: I need to blow my nose and then I will see about a interim release
2011-04-11T12:24:49  <AutomatedTester> stupid cold
2011-04-11T12:24:51  <jarib> jleyba and i discussed some solutions, but for now i'm thinking of just cleaning up at_exit
2011-04-11T12:25:46  <jarib> jleyba: btw, i'm pretty convinced i prefer "shut down server with browsers running" over --autoclose
2011-04-11T12:26:09  <jarib> (the first behaviour could still be enabled by a switch of course)

2011-04-11T13:44:58  <jimevans> charleyb: no problem, happy to help. fire away.
2011-04-11T13:45:23  <charleyb> ie showmodal support, we have it in watir
2011-04-11T13:45:33  <charleyb> but it's fairly hacky
2011-04-11T13:45:55  <jimevans> yep. i think i'm vaguely familiar with the implementation.
2011-04-11T13:46:02  <charleyb> i'd love to pick your brain about how to support it properly
2011-04-11T13:46:18  <charleyb> it's a pain in the neck
2011-04-11T13:46:20  <charleyb> :\
2011-04-11T13:46:44  <charleyb> i know you're dealing with that now for the se code
2011-04-11T13:46:56  <jimevans> yep, i'm elbows deep in trying to get it working.
2011-04-11T13:47:03  <charleyb> indeed :)
2011-04-11T13:47:17  <charleyb> i got warned about asking you this question :)
2011-04-11T13:47:44  <jimevans> no warning necessary; i try not to shoot the messenger. :)
2011-04-11T13:47:56  <jimevans> but you're right, it's a pain in the neck.
2011-04-11T13:48:05  <charleyb> yes it is
2011-04-11T13:48:18  <jimevans> mainly because the window displayed by showModalDialog() doesn't implement IWebBrowser2.
2011-04-11T13:48:36  <charleyb> yup
2011-04-11T13:48:37  *** toseter has quit IRC
2011-04-11T13:49:08  <jimevans> the webdriver api has the concept of the list of currently managed windows (i.e., driver.getWindowHandles())
2011-04-11T13:49:21  <charleyb> it's a wholly fantastical aberration of a "window"
2011-04-11T13:49:47  <jimevans> well, yes, because it must be dealt with before you can go back to another "real" browser window.
2011-04-11T13:50:34  <jimevans> but, it also doesn't fit the concept of an "alert" as defined by the webdriver api, because it makes sense you'd want to examine the contents while it's up.
2011-04-11T13:51:48  <jimevans> so the way i'm approaching it is that it will be added to the list of managed browser windows, just like clicking on a link with target="_blank"
2011-04-11T13:52:27  <jimevans> the implementation won't prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot by calling switchTo().window() back to a blocked window.
2011-04-11T13:52:30  <charleyb> that makes sense
2011-04-11T13:52:45  <jimevans> but it's better than nothing.
2011-04-11T13:52:46  *** nirvdrum has quit IRC
2011-04-11T13:52:56  <charleyb> how are you connecting to it?
2011-04-11T13:53:17  *** nirvdrum has joined #selenium
2011-04-11T13:53:51  <jimevans> same way as with an IWebBrowser2. grab the IHTMLDocument2 using WM_HTML_GETOBJECT.
2011-04-11T13:54:31  <jimevans> there's a base class (right now called HtmlWindow, but I'll probably change that) of which Browser and HtmlDialog are subclasses.
2011-04-11T13:54:43  <jimevans> (this is in the unmanaged C++/COM code)
2011-04-11T13:55:20  *** anatoli has joined #selenium
2011-04-11T13:55:23  <jimevans> Browser maintains a pointer to the IWebBrowser2 object; HtmlDialog maintains a pointer to the IHTMLDocument2 object.
2011-04-11T13:56:04  <jimevans> There are abstract methods implemented in the subclasses for things like GetDocument, Close, GetTitle and so on.
2011-04-11T13:56:20  <charleyb> ah, ok
2011-04-11T13:56:40  <jimevans> The things that *require* an IWebBrowser2 object (like navigation), will return an error if attempted on an HtmlDialog.
2011-04-11T13:57:12  <jimevans> Most stuff that we do, oddly enough, doesn't actually require the browser object.
2011-04-11T13:57:34  <jimevans> Navigation is the big one.
2011-04-11T13:57:51  <jimevans> The other big hassle is knowing when the dialog is dismissed.
2011-04-11T13:58:15  <jimevans> With IWebBrowser2, we can sink an OnQuit event. With an IHTMLDocument2, no such luck.
2011-04-11T13:58:59  *** melter has quit IRC
2011-04-11T13:59:13  <jimevans> Turns out to be a pretty big deal for us too, since we're in unmanaged code, and we need to clean up the resources thoroughly when we're done using them.
2011-04-11T13:59:25  <charleyb> that's fine, then the tests should know, although if you're maintaining the list, that sucks
2011-04-11T13:59:43  *** anatoli has quit IRC
2011-04-11T13:59:48  <jimevans> and we are maintaining the list, so it does, in fact, suck.
2011-04-11T13:59:54  <charleyb> yeah
2011-04-11T14:00:26  <charleyb> guh, can you not poll through the list and determine what's still valid?
2011-04-11T14:00:34  <charleyb> nasty solution
2011-04-11T14:00:34  <jimevans> The saving grace is that using showModalDialog() is not exactly encouraged practice.
2011-04-11T14:00:51  <charleyb> dig this
2011-04-11T14:01:02  <charleyb> so you're right for most public websites
2011-04-11T14:01:19  <charleyb> internal enterprise applications, not so much
2011-04-11T14:02:04  <charleyb> one of the company's internal sites used up to 8 showModals
2011-04-11T14:02:40  <jimevans> yikes. my thought process was along the lines of making modal dialogs work *just* well enough.
2011-04-11T14:02:54  <charleyb> these are well used and known order management and warehouse management systems
2011-04-11T14:03:14  <charleyb> yikes indeed
2011-04-11T14:03:56  <charleyb> watir's quick hack has worked well
2011-04-11T14:04:23  <jimevans> sounds like you're more familiar with the in-the-wild usage of showModalDialog(), how common is it to navigate from one page to another within the modal?
2011-04-11T14:04:36  *** keturn has joined #selenium
2011-04-11T14:04:36  <charleyb> very common
2011-04-11T14:04:44  <charleyb> at least in my experience
2011-04-11T14:05:00  <jimevans> i can envision wizard-like behavior being common.
2011-04-11T14:05:07  <jimevans> and others.
2011-04-11T14:05:33  <charleyb> and popping out into additional "modals" also common, so nesting is an issue
2011-04-11T14:07:00  <charleyb> i'm not sure if it's wizard like, but can be
2011-04-11T14:07:03  <jimevans> and unlike window.open(), you can't set a name within the showModalDialog() call, so our API makes it challenging to find the new window.
2011-04-11T14:07:12  <charleyb> calls centers are using it as well
2011-04-11T14:07:17  <jimevans> i think i've got the nesting issue under control.
2011-04-11T14:07:24  <jimevans> conceptually anyway.
2011-04-11T14:08:17  <charleyb> i've mostly handled it through the test framework and modal access
2011-04-11T14:09:35  <charleyb> and not relying on anything else to keep track of the windows
2011-04-11T14:10:21  <jimevans> that would make life simpler, but the webdriver api demands it.
2011-04-11T14:10:23  <charleyb> you're right about title and anything else to denote the window
2011-04-11T14:10:48  <charleyb> fair enough
2011-04-11T14:11:19  <charleyb> i can poke around your code where?

2011-04-11T14:12:28  <jimevans> well, the showModalDialog handling hasn't been committed yet, but you can find the IE driver code in the Selenium SVN repository.
2011-04-11T14:12:44  <jimevans> http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
2011-04-11T14:13:00  <charleyb> yeah, it's the showmodal stuff i really want :)

2011-04-11T14:13:51  <jimevans> i keep thinking i'm close to having something i can check in, but then something comes up that i didn't consider. :)
2011-04-11T14:14:42  <charleyb> i like transparency, can't you check in and mark as not ready for use :)
2011-04-11T14:15:43  <charleyb> maybe not the greatest idea, i'm not sure how you do checkins on selenium
2011-04-11T14:16:09  <charleyb> given you're stuck with SVN!!! :)
2011-04-11T14:16:21  <jimevans> this would be pretty core to the IE driver, and I'd really not want to destablize it.
2011-04-11T14:16:43  <charleyb> git svn bridge and checkin on github? :D
2011-04-11T14:17:02  <jimevans> I should be able to check something in tonight. more likely tomorrow morning, as the workday is almost over here, and I need to pick up the kids in a bit.
2011-04-11T14:17:13  <charleyb> btw, I'm a royal pain in the ass in case you can't tell :)
2011-04-11T14:17:29  <jimevans> notice how i'm tactfully ignoring the github suggestions :D

2011-04-11T14:58:59  <jimevans> charleyb: ^^ got it done before i left.
2011-04-11T14:58:59  <charleyb> jarib: good question :)
2011-04-11T14:59:07  <nirvdrum> jarib: I believe any similar.  At its core, it's just a dispatcher.
2011-04-11T14:59:12  <jarib> right
2011-04-11T14:59:17  <jarib> that's pretty cool
2011-04-11T14:59:23  <nirvdrum> I'd have to verify with Francois.
2011-04-11T14:59:34  <nirvdrum> We obviously added in special support for the old Se 1 protocol.
2011-04-11T14:59:44  <jimevans> at the moment, i wouldn't actually try it with showModalDialog(), because it's likely to crash horribly, but you can see where my thinking is at this point.
2011-04-11T14:59:46  <charleyb> jimevans: sweet, i'll take a look
2011-04-11T15:00:23  <charleyb> jimevans: i haven't seen anything close to what i'm looking for, so that's a godsend

2011-04-11T15:01:42  <jimevans> gotta run. later guys.

2011-04-11T15:01:46  <charleyb> wtf am i doing spending so much time on the selenium channel lately :)
2011-04-11T15:01:54  <jarib> haha
2011-04-11T15:02:42  <charleyb> kidnapped and drugged is the only way to explain it
2011-04-11T15:04:42  <charleyb> watir still rocks for those concerned :D
2011-04-11T15:05:01  <nirvdrum> Heh.
2011-04-11T15:05:44  <nirvdrum> Sent out first set of basic instructions on how to use grid 2.  It's still much terser than it ultimately should be, but hopefully some others can start playing around with it.
2011-04-11T15:06:09  <charleyb> saw that, so it's all java eh?
2011-04-11T15:06:23  <nirvdrum> Yeah.
2011-04-11T15:06:42  <nirvdrum> Well, the server portion.
2011-04-11T15:06:45  <charleyb> fair enough
2011-04-11T15:06:47  <nirvdrum> The clients can be whatever.
2011-04-11T15:06:51  <charleyb> sure
2011-04-11T15:06:55  <nirvdrum> I'm using it with selenium-webdriver.
2011-04-11T15:07:15  <nirvdrum> I.e., the ruby gem.
2011-04-11T15:07:33  <nirvdrum> Do you see it being written in Java as problematic?
2011-04-11T15:07:56  <charleyb> no, that's probably for the best
2011-04-11T15:07:58  <nirvdrum> For all its other faults, Java / JVM do incredibly well with handling loads of concurrent connections.
2011-04-11T15:08:07  *** santiycr has quit IRC
2011-04-11T15:08:16  <charleyb> i haven't done serious java for a few years :)
2011-04-11T15:08:27  <nirvdrum> Me neither ;-)
2011-04-11T15:08:52  <charleyb> what are you working in?
2011-04-11T15:09:41  <charleyb> i think java probably makes the most sense, might be fun to do it in jruby :)
2011-04-11T15:10:01  <nirvdrum> I'm in Ruby for the most part.
2011-04-11T15:10:07  <nirvdrum> I fall back into Java and C++ when needed.
2011-04-11T15:10:34  <nirvdrum> I used to do Python & some variants of assembly, too, but I've been out of that for a few years.
2011-04-11T15:17:37  <charleyb> same here, though i don't fall into assembler
2011-04-11T15:18:11  <nirvdrum> I used to own a company that made hardware devices.
2011-04-11T15:18:20  <nirvdrum> So, sorta had to.
2011-04-11T15:18:47  <charleyb> i used to work at a company many lifes ago that did scanners and image editing
2011-04-11T15:20:13  <charleyb> learned enough assembler to crack apps, but that was about it
2011-04-11T15:21:38  <nirvdrum> It was actually pretty cool.  On the PICs there were only 32 opcodes so I could read hex output and decode in my head.  I learned to appreciate writing tight code.
2011-04-11T15:22:01  <nirvdrum> Reducing from 4k words code => 2k words allowed us to save $0.50 / chip.  We were ordering in batches of 10,000.
2011-04-11T15:22:07  <nirvdrum> So, the savings was real.
2011-04-11T15:22:45  <nirvdrum> Okay.  Starting to descend.  Gotta lose the laptop.  See you guys later.

2011-04-11T19:14:23  <BryanLemon> AutomatedTester, I have a quick question. Have you had any luck using HtmlUnitDriver with js enabled on a page with jQuery?
2011-04-11T19:14:49  <AutomatedTester> i dont use htmlunit

2011-04-11T19:15:20  <AutomatedTester> but would be suprised if it doesnt work
2011-04-11T19:16:00  <BryanLemon> It isn't working when you load http://www.racingjunk.com
2011-04-11T19:16:31  <BryanLemon> Let me find a stacktrace (if you don't mind trying to point me in the right direction)
2011-04-11T19:18:21  <AutomatedTester> sure
2011-04-11T19:19:58  <BryanLemon> http://bryanlemon.com/trace.txt
2011-04-11T19:20:35  <BryanLemon> Actually, the tops chopped off.
2011-04-11T19:21:44  <BryanLemon> Fixed
2011-04-11T19:28:25  <AutomatedTester> glad its sorted
2011-04-11T19:29:13  <BryanLemon> Oh, no, I was meaning I got the trace fixed so the top is there. Sorry about the poor choice of words.
2011-04-11T19:30:45  <AutomatedTester> can I have the code that caused
2011-04-11T19:30:48  <AutomatedTester> it
2011-04-11T19:31:44  <BryanLemon> Sure. Want the whole java file, or just the interesting parts?
2011-04-11T19:32:09  <AutomatedTester> the interesting part is good for me
2011-04-11T19:32:25  <BryanLemon>         driver = new HtmlUnitDriver(true);          Logger logger = Logger.getLogger ("");         logger.setLevel (Level.OFF);          driver.get("http://www.racingjunk.com/");
2011-04-11T19:34:07  <AutomatedTester> so the HtmlUnitDriver() line is blowing up?
2011-04-11T19:34:14  <AutomatedTester> or the get?
2011-04-11T19:34:40  <BryanLemon> Sorry, its the get
2011-04-11T19:34:47  <AutomatedTester> ok cool
2011-04-11T19:35:03  <BryanLemon> Also, if the logger is taken out, it generates a lot of SEVERE errors like this one:
