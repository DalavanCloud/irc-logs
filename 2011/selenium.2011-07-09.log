2011-07-09T11:25:20  <Mayank1> AutomatedTester: ^
2011-07-09T11:25:41  <AutomatedTester> xpath using starts-with or ends-with?
2011-07-09T11:26:23  <Mayank1> AutomatedTester: but the problem the driver fails to retirve the title attribute that is addedd through AJAX as well.
2011-07-09T11:26:46  <Mayank1> I eaither want to click that element or extract its title attribute
2011-07-09T11:26:54  <Mayank1> s/eaither/either
2011-07-09T11:27:09  <AutomatedTester> why won't xpath work again?
2011-07-09T11:28:01  <Mayank1> but the title attribute findElement(By.xpath('somepath').getAttribute('title')
2011-07-09T11:28:04  <Mayank1> returns nothing
2011-07-09T11:28:14  <Mayank1> maybe because its added through AJAX
2011-07-09T11:28:58  <Mayank1> but I have tried both explicit wait, and making the thread to sleep as long as 2 minutes, still I am not able to retrieve the title attribute
