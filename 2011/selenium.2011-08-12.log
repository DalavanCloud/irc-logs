2011-08-12T02:03:52  <lisak> hi, I switched to selenium-firefox-driver  2.3.1 and as the option.setSelected(); deprecated and one is using option.click();
2011-08-12T02:04:40  <lisak> it works like 50/50,  the same test  throws Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with
2011-08-12T02:04:46  <lisak> like every second time
2011-08-12T02:06:49  <lisak> http://pastebin.com/Abnwvucu
2011-08-12T02:06:50  <andreashaas> as far as I remember did the option.setSelected call option.click directly
2011-08-12T02:07:50  <lisak> andreashaas, there is no option.setSelected() method
2011-08-12T02:07:54  <lisak> in 2.3.1

2011-08-12T02:08:00  <freynaud> Good morning
2011-08-12T02:10:52  <lisak> guys what should i do :) ?  I wrote these tests 6 months ago...remember shit now to fix all this
2011-08-12T02:12:03  *** cburroughs has joined #selenium
2011-08-12T02:12:49  <andreashaas> The code in setSelected was if(!option.isSelected()) { option.click(); }
2011-08-12T02:13:20  <lisak> I see
2011-08-12T02:13:23  <andreashaas> so when you substitute option.setSelected by this line you should be fine
2011-08-12T02:13:40  <andreashaas> or there is another problem
2011-08-12T02:13:40  <lisak> then there's gotta be a bug in 2.3.1 cause it was working fine in 2.0
2011-08-12T02:14:16  <andreashaas> When it works every other time it may be a timing issue
2011-08-12T02:19:33  *** naeg has joined #selenium
2011-08-12T02:22:11  <lisak> definitely not timing issue, I'm debugging that,  doesn't relate to timing

2011-08-12T03:55:59  <jarib> also, what's the return value of page.driver.class ?
2011-08-12T03:56:45  <killa> version: selenium-webdriver (0.2.2)
2011-08-12T03:56:56  <jarib> latest is 2.4.0
2011-08-12T03:57:00  <jarib> try updating
2011-08-12T03:57:04  <jarib> also, 98 is wrong
2011-08-12T03:57:37  <jarib> you want one of the symbols here http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/common/keys.rb
2011-08-12T03:57:53  <killa> page.driver.class returns Capybara::Selenium::Driver
2011-08-12T03:58:03  <jarib> ok, so that's not right either
2011-08-12T03:58:41  <killa> i will update of course. I didnt care much about selenium itself up to this moment, default capybara was enough for my needs, so i didnt watch for news
2011-08-12T03:58:58  <killa> i will update and check if anything changes
2011-08-12T03:59:02  <jarib> page.driver.browser should return the underlying Selenium::WebDriver::Driver instance
2011-08-12T03:59:17  <killa> oh, i initialize selenium like this http://pastie.org/2360575

2011-08-12T03:59:48  <killa> can old version generate the error?
2011-08-12T04:00:17  <jarib> old version of selenium-webdriver could give you "undefined method `action'"
2011-08-12T04:00:26  <killa> ok
2011-08-12T04:00:37  <jarib> what key do you want to press?
2011-08-12T04:00:39  <jarib> (and why?)
2011-08-12T04:01:03  <killa> i want to press "b", which should call js action
2011-08-12T04:01:32  <killa> basically "press b and check if there is "somestring" on page"
2011-08-12T04:02:06  <jarib> should work with just some_element.send_keys 'b'
2011-08-12T04:02:30  <killa> will it work with pressing space also?
2011-08-12T04:02:32  <jarib> (though in capybara that may be node.native.send_keys 'b' to access Selenium::Webdriver::Element)
2011-08-12T04:02:47  <jarib> anything from the Keys hash in the link i gave you
2011-08-12T04:03:03  <killa> ok
2011-08-12T04:03:27  <jarib> you can e.g. do some_text_field.send_keys([:control, 'a'], :backspace) to clear the field

2011-08-12T05:15:06  <jarib> killa: is that the object you expect to find the method on?
2011-08-12T05:15:37  <killa> i know you said before we expect webdriver object
2011-08-12T05:15:45  <jarib> [13:55]      jarib : [13:10]      jarib : page.driver.browser should return the underlying Selenium::WebDriver::Driver instance
2011-08-12T05:15:58  <jarib> [14:21]      killa : page.driver.action.send_keys 'b'
2011-08-12T05:16:01  <killa> browser gets me webdriver instance
2011-08-12T05:16:14  <jarib> can you access .action on that?
2011-08-12T05:16:59  <killa> i hate when people talk to me like to child, but i must suck it, i behave like one : <

2011-08-12T05:22:38  <killa> yeah, tried it.
2011-08-12T05:22:41  <killa> will try again
2011-08-12T05:23:29  <jarib> and like i said, you don't really need .action for this - you could call send_keys on the element that listens for the key events
2011-08-12T05:23:41  <jarib> e.g. node.native.send_keys 'b'
2011-08-12T05:23:44  <jarib> where node is a capybara node.
2011-08-12T05:24:29  <killa> funnily, i don get no method error on page.driver.browser.action

2011-08-12T05:42:34  <lord1234> jarib: that bug I had yesterdya, I can't seem to reproduce it on a stripped down version of the page:(
2011-08-12T05:43:03  <jarib> then you've stripped out something important
2011-08-12T05:43:07  <lord1234> obviously
2011-08-12T05:43:11  <lord1234> but I have no idea what
2011-08-12T05:43:23  <lord1234> i mean, i stripped out a bunch of the underlying CSS so i'm guessing thats it
2011-08-12T05:43:28  <lord1234> but I don't even know which it is...
2011-08-12T05:43:56  <jarib> so if you re-add the CSS, you can reproduce the problem?
2011-08-12T05:44:13  <lord1234> i'm tring to figure out if i can
2011-08-12T05:44:24  <jarib> that's the way to go
2011-08-12T05:47:04  <killa> jarib: SUCCES!
2011-08-12T05:47:08  <killa> after all this work
2011-08-12T05:47:30  <killa> succesfull combination is page.driver.browser.action.send_keys("b").perform
2011-08-12T05:47:36  <killa> which leads me to think
2011-08-12T05:48:43  <killa> that cucumber REALLY needs defined press_key function

2011-08-12T07:01:04  <jarib> lord1234: like i said, $DEBUG = true anywhere in your code or pass -d to ruby on the command line
2011-08-12T07:01:04  <jimevans> np.
2011-08-12T07:01:17  <jimevans> be glad to get those into the project.
2011-08-12T07:01:20  <lord1234> i got it
2011-08-12T07:01:29  <eranm_> BTW I don't see a reason to use pointers
2011-08-12T07:01:35  <eranm_> given that you have references.
2011-08-12T07:02:07  <jimevans> how closely do we follow the Google C++ coding standards?
2011-08-12T07:09:43  <eranm_> You mean this one? http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml
2011-08-12T07:09:51  <jimevans> yep, that's the one.
2011-08-12T07:11:37  <jimevans> I know there's a fair amount of code in the IE driver that wouldn't pass cpplint, mostly because of line lengths.
2011-08-12T07:12:01  <jimevans> but the webdriver-server project is mostly compliant.

2011-08-12T07:13:47  <eranm_> jimevans: You're right in pointing this out - since we're sticking to the style guide, might as well use pointers
2011-08-12T07:13:58  <jimevans> really looking forward to getting the interactions pieces implemented for IE.
2011-08-12T07:17:03  <jimevans> eranm_: it doesn't matter to me really whether we use the style guide or not. I just didn't know if our intention was to follow it or not.
2011-08-12T07:17:28  <simonstewart> I've asked the googlers to follow the style guides for java and javascript
2011-08-12T07:17:35  <simonstewart> makes sense to expand that to c++ as well
2011-08-12T07:17:59  <simonstewart> (though as you do most of the C++, you get the only vote that counts, jimevans)
2011-08-12T07:19:31  <jimevans> heh. until recently, I didn't care. now that others are starting to contribute, it makes sense to standardize style.
2011-08-12T07:21:12  <eranm_> It makes sense to stick to one style guide, doesn't matter which one

2011-08-12T07:27:54  <wislem> Hello, I'm having a small problem with timeouts in firefox.  I have a page that appears to never finish loading with FirefoxDriver (Firefox status bar is 'transferring data from...').  I have the driver's timeout set to 30 seconds, but after an hour of waiting the page is still up.  Any ideas on how to resolve this?
2011-08-12T07:29:33  <Gungy> hi smion
2011-08-12T07:29:47  <Gungy> im using the new rc 2.3.0 version
2011-08-12T07:29:56  <Gungy> and the java client 2.3.0
2011-08-12T07:30:02  <Gungy> set up the build path
2011-08-12T07:30:26  <Gungy> set up a firefox profile because im testing against https
2011-08-12T07:31:07  <Gungy> execute the JUnit, fires up the browser but is not executing or doing anything?
2011-08-12T07:31:11  <Gungy> can you help?
2011-08-12T07:31:14  <simonstewart> you shouldn't need to do anything special to test against https with firefox
2011-08-12T07:32:24  <jarib> wislem: what timeout?
2011-08-12T07:33:13  <wislem> driver.manage()timeouts().implicitlyWait(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
2011-08-12T07:33:41  <Gungy> just hangs for a while, im expecting the username and password to be fired in on the login screen page
2011-08-12T07:34:00  <Gungy> worked perfectly fine when using 2.0.0
2011-08-12T07:34:36  <lord1234> what version of FF?
2011-08-12T07:34:46  <jarib> wislem: that's not related to the initial page load. there's currently no API to configure timeouts for that (it's being discussed though)
2011-08-12T07:34:56  <Gungy> 3.6.19
2011-08-12T07:35:10  <wislem> I see, are there any known workarounds then?
2011-08-12T07:36:30  *** vrockai has quit IRC
2011-08-12T07:36:34  <jarib> not sure in java, in ruby we have configurable timeouts for the internal requests between ruby and firefox
2011-08-12T07:39:58  <Gungy> can i get 2.0.0 from somewhere?

2011-08-12T07:46:32  <Gungy> can i ask, how do you upgrade - is it deleting the standalone jar file and java client file and then simply replacing it with the newer version?
2011-08-12T07:46:43  <simonstewart> yeah
2011-08-12T07:46:53  <simonstewart> unless we also update a dependency

2011-08-12T08:16:03  <simonstewart> The obvious test would be to have something that that does and something that des bnot implement WrapsElement

2011-08-12T08:26:43  <simonstewart> eranm_: rather than using the entire bounding client rect, use the first client rect
2011-08-12T08:27:17  <jimevans> there's also now a test in the .NET bindings for it, if you want to port it to Java.

2011-08-12T08:58:21  <Parabola> question :(
2011-08-12T08:58:36  <Parabola> the method that I want the return from is in a subclass
2011-08-12T08:58:54  <Parabola> where i want the return is in another class
2011-08-12T08:59:21  <Parabola> so, class2 extends class1, class2 has the method i want the return from, in class 1

2011-08-12T09:26:03  <jimevans> the whole "what chrome driver currently supports" is a huge black box to me.

2011-08-12T09:27:27  <jimevans> sure, i'd expect that, but it'd be nice to have a full catalog of what features we have mapped out, and what each driver supports.
2011-08-12T09:27:38  <simonstewart> Indeed.
2011-08-12T09:27:42  <simonstewart> We should put a chart up somewhere
2011-08-12T09:28:19  <dawagner> jimevans: Yeah, I think when the java stuff has moved to JUnit 4 jarib's Ignore script will help with that
2011-08-12T09:29:10  <jimevans> you know what else would be useful would be a catalog of all of the tests in the test bed.
2011-08-12T09:29:37  <jimevans> kind of like a simple list that documents what tests we expect a compliant driver implementation to pass.
2011-08-12T09:29:50  <jimevans> yes, I know you can
2011-08-12T09:29:59  <jimevans> "just look at the code"
2011-08-12T09:30:44  <dawagner> jimevans: That sounds a lot like a slightly more formal version of the JsonWireProtocol?
2011-08-12T09:30:46  <jimevans> but right now, it's a constant struggle for me to keep, for example, the .NET bindings tests aligned with the reference implementation (Java)
2011-08-12T09:31:46  <jimevans> (which I like to do, because it's *far* easier to debug the IE driver from the .NET tests that the Java ones)
2011-08-12T09:32:11  <jimevans> but that's just me being lazy and selfish.
2011-08-12T09:32:51  *** emil_temp_nick has left #selenium
2011-08-12T09:35:10  <dawagner> jimevans: Those are two of the adjectives at the very bottom of the list as to how I'd describe you!
2011-08-12T09:35:15  <jimevans> every time I start thinking about the differences between language binding test beds, a very small part of me (which I've almost managed to crush into silence) that a language-independent test description format would be good.
2011-08-12T09:35:54  <jimevans> then I realize that's just heading down the path of selenese, and beat that very small part into submission again.
2011-08-12T09:36:26  <dawagner> See, I keep wanting to start doing code-gen for a lot of stuff which is common-but-subtly-different-because-of-the-languages cross-language
2011-08-12T09:36:29  <jimevans> no, I'm all about making my job easier. that's one reason I automate in the first place.

2011-08-12T10:43:37  <adamgoucher> we do have a committee of people who are to guide the project. now we need organization on how they do it. it should not. be. this. hard. for them to all say 'yes or no' and report back to the list.

2011-08-12T10:45:29  <lukeis> lack of 'management' structure is what i like about OSS ;)
2011-08-12T10:46:22  <RossPatterson> Samit: Selenium is imporant to us, but not so important that we'll spend large amounts of cash on a conference.  I might need to submit a talk to arrange attendance.
2011-08-12T10:47:38  <RossPatterson> lukeis: All successful OSS projects have a management structure.  In some, it's nearly invisible, in others, it's right out front, but it's always there.  Only the small hobby projects lack one, and then it's usually just a single committer.
2011-08-12T10:47:48  <Samit> RossPatterson: Talk sounds interesting as well.

2011-08-12T11:16:46  <adamgoucher> i'm not opposed to new people using webdriver. my beef has been, and remains, the lack of a clean migration path in all supported languages before calling 2.0.0. though i understand the tech reasons behind, i still think they should have been addressed
2011-08-12T11:17:56  *** dawagner has joined #selenium
2011-08-12T11:18:21  <lukeis> ah, also seems weird that official support of two bindings was dropped (yeah, i know there weren't many people to pick it up).
2011-08-12T11:18:27  <RossPatterson> And, in hindsight, we should have had the SeHq doc rewritten for WebDriver as part of 2.0.0 also.

2011-08-12T11:20:39  <jimevans> at the risk of being pedantic, I think Visual Studio usually creates Program.cs.

2011-08-12T11:40:17  <kenneth_> adamgoucher: In your article posted on prag programming, I noticed that the BasePageObject is a subclass of unittest. Why is that so?
2011-08-12T11:42:14  <ChrisCulver> oh good question
2011-08-12T11:42:20  <ChrisCulver> i have a seperate test base and page base
2011-08-12T11:42:41  <adamgoucher> to get all the asserts
2011-08-12T11:43:03  <adamgoucher> even though i now use py.test as the runner, i still inherit from unittest.testcase to pull them in
2011-08-12T11:43:03  <kenneth_> Gotcha, I thought so.
2011-08-12T11:43:13  <Nogem> Ajay: I'm not following. How does that picture mean the various browser drivers are no longer needed to emulate browser behavior? What does that have to do with getting an empty jar?

2011-08-12T11:43:32  <adamgoucher> py.test's belief is that 'assert' is all you need. which, sure, is right, but its annoying
2011-08-12T11:44:00  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester as an egg that has some of those asserts separate that i might switch to

2011-08-12T12:19:10  <Nogem> could try that too, there's multiple events fired by moving your cursor to the item to click - try emulating that chain of events

2011-08-12T12:54:13  <farlan> thats if I know the cookie name, but I generally will not (third parties)
2011-08-12T12:54:29  <lukeis> there's a getCookies() too
2011-08-12T12:54:38  <lukeis> but that only returns cookies in your domain
2011-08-12T12:54:52  <farlan> getCookies seems to return only in the given domain
2011-08-12T12:55:00  <lukeis> yep
2011-08-12T12:55:21  <Parabola> hmm
2011-08-12T12:55:27  <lukeis> if you know the domain of the cookie you want... point your driver to it (get) and then call getCookies
2011-08-12T12:56:47  <Parabola> not sure if this is valid, but if you don't know the domain either, but content in the cookie, write your own reader

2011-08-12T12:57:14  <Parabola> and as far as getting a list of the files, i'm not sure, maybe dump into an arrayList ?

2011-08-12T12:58:30  <Parabola> someone smarter may have a better way to do that :)
2011-08-12T12:58:51  <lukeis> you can always see what domains are potentially used by seeing by checking the domains of the script and link (css) tags

2011-08-12T13:01:16  <Parabola> i'm aware of overrides and overloading
2011-08-12T13:01:42  <farlan> how did you override it ebass?
2011-08-12T13:01:54  <ebass> using the javascript executor
2011-08-12T13:02:06  <ebass> i get the cookies for the domain using javascript
2011-08-12T13:02:16  <ebass> and parse the string that it returns
2011-08-12T13:02:35  <farlan> ah, but you need to know the domain
2011-08-12T13:02:38  <Parabola> loosely-typed & dynamic language FTW!
2011-08-12T13:02:38  <ebass> and store them to an inner cookie class
2011-08-12T13:03:00  <ebass> usually if u are getting cookies in selenium/webdriver you will need at least a domain
2011-08-12T13:03:49  <ebass> if not you can always get the page that you are on, if not in WebDriver in JS
2011-08-12T13:05:33  <farlan> ok so I'm trying to get ALL cookies dropped on my site ( from advertisers mostly ), which means I will not necessarily know which domains or cookie names will be dropped ahead of time
2011-08-12T13:06:01  <Parabola> then you're stuck with filtering all of them
2011-08-12T13:06:10  <Parabola> thats my guess anyway
2011-08-12T13:06:11  <ebass> lukeis: if I request cookies for a domain i would expect WebDriver to return all cookies for that domain.
2011-08-12T13:06:32  <adamgoucher> if you are not testing in production, could you not just turn off all the 3rd party crap?
2011-08-12T13:07:01  <adamgoucher> (could also use your local hosts file to send them off into the ether if not)
2011-08-12T13:07:14  <lukeis> ebass: there's no api to request per domain... other than going to said domain and then calling getCookies
2011-08-12T13:07:40  <lukeis> and yes, it should return all cookies scoped appropriated for that domain
2011-08-12T13:07:43  *** netcarver_ has joined #selenium
2011-08-12T13:08:32  <lukeis> i don't know if webdriver adhere's to the "path" of a cookie, haven't tested that
2011-08-12T13:08:40  *** netcarver has quit IRC
2011-08-12T13:08:46  <ebass> lukeis: its counter intuitive when i request getCookies for a given domain and it only gives the ones back that are scoped to the path that is displayed in the location bar.  Then when i right click in Firefox and click page info > show cookies it shows all cookies for the domain.
2011-08-12T13:09:03  <lukeis> that is to me...
2011-08-12T13:09:15  <lukeis> it's acting like the browser acts for that page
2011-08-12T13:09:26  <ebass> ?
2011-08-12T13:09:33  <ebass> not really.
2011-08-12T13:09:40  <lukeis> the http request to your server only gets those cookies
2011-08-12T13:09:41  <ebass> the browser returns all cookies for the domain
2011-08-12T13:09:42  <farlan> ah I just with webdriver had an api similar to just going to Firefox's preferences/privacy/show cookies
2011-08-12T13:09:48  <farlan> wish*
2011-08-12T13:10:16  <ebass> WebDriver return all cookies for the current path and the domain when I explicity tell it that I want all cookies for the domain.
2011-08-12T13:10:23  <lukeis> does document.cookie return the cookies that you don't get at the current location?
2011-08-12T13:10:27  <ebass> thats what im talking about farlan
2011-08-12T13:10:29  <ebass> yes
2011-08-12T13:10:58  <ebass> which is why I imagine the browser displays them too.

2011-08-12T13:12:07  <farlan> hmm time to start looking at that FirefoxProfile code, might need to do something custom for what I'm trying to do I'm afrais
2011-08-12T13:12:24  <ebass> farlan: i assume you can only test in production?
2011-08-12T13:12:30  <farlan> yup

2011-08-12T13:12:46  <farlan> advertisers are not going to give me access to their staging envs :)
2011-08-12T13:12:57  <ebass> right
2011-08-12T13:13:19  <ebass> but couldnt you pose as an advertiser to test how your site handles third party cookies?
2011-08-12T13:14:28  <farlan> sure, I have that already, but thats not the point of the exercise, the test is to try to figure out who drops what
2011-08-12T13:14:49  <farlan> and who calls on other third parties

2011-08-12T13:17:10  <ebass> what?
2011-08-12T13:17:15  <dawagner> Turns out you can click on the <title> element
2011-08-12T13:17:21  <ebass> hehe
2011-08-12T13:17:23  <dawagner> Because we declare it visible, so that we can getText from it
2011-08-12T13:17:24  <ebass> and what happens?
2011-08-12T13:17:56  *** netcarver_ has quit IRC
2011-08-12T13:18:07  <ebass> I guess a real user can try to click the title element...
2011-08-12T13:18:10  <dawagner> I'm not actually sure for real browsers; I'm only playing with HtmlUnit at the moment
2011-08-12T13:18:15  <dawagner> It definitely won't do *that*, though
2011-08-12T13:20:59  <ebass> i wonder if clicking it twice would minimize the window :-D

2011-08-12T13:49:17  <Parabola> sudo code
2011-08-12T13:49:19  <Parabola> i'm doing this in java
2011-08-12T13:50:49  <Parabola> its para++
2011-08-12T13:50:54  <Parabola> havent you seen it before? !
2011-08-12T13:51:21  <lukeis> even pseudo code, i would make separate testRunner into two separate methods and just call the one you want to run with the driver you init'd
2011-08-12T13:52:44  <lukeis> i guess i don't know how you're going to organize that all.... but in java if it's a member of the class you don't need this unless there's another variable in scope of that method with the same name
2011-08-12T13:52:57  <Parabola> :)
2011-08-12T13:53:10  <lukeis> need "this" unless
2011-08-12T13:53:18  <lukeis> hope you got that ;)

2011-08-12T13:59:55  <ebass> i just caught up
2011-08-12T14:01:30  <ebass> i dont know how your build environment works
2011-08-12T14:02:33  <ebass> i would create a more advanced enumerated type where you can associate each type with the desired capabilities you want.
2011-08-12T14:02:37  <ebass> then you can just pass the enum
2011-08-12T14:02:47  <ebass> and get the desired capability from it
2011-08-12T14:03:55  <ebass> then you could specify a string in a configuration somewhere and convert it to the enumerated type
2011-08-12T14:06:59  <Parabola> grr
2011-08-12T14:07:07  <Parabola> i've got variables at the class level that i made public
2011-08-12T14:07:24  <Parabola> and the only way i can access them in another class seems to be if i extend that class, but thats not possible in this case
2011-08-12T14:08:37  <Parabola> how do i uh, do that
2011-08-12T14:08:49  <Parabola> erm, make that work
2011-08-12T14:10:47  <ebass> if you make them public static variables you can access them.
2011-08-12T14:10:56  <Parabola> static means i cannot change them correct?
2011-08-12T14:10:59  <ebass> no
2011-08-12T14:11:05  <ebass> final means you cannot change them
2011-08-12T14:11:08  <Parabola> oh right
2011-08-12T14:11:11  <Parabola> wtf is static then
2011-08-12T14:11:18  <ebass> static means that you can access them without instantiating a class.
2011-08-12T14:11:31  <Parabola> they are persistant?
2011-08-12T14:11:36  <ebass> you can change them
2011-08-12T14:11:49  <ebass> Classname.staticVariableName = "bla";
2011-08-12T14:12:52  <ebass> the only thing is, if you access it in a function then that function also needs to be static.

2011-08-12T15:17:00  <Parabola> lukeis: i'm having a fundamental problem
2011-08-12T15:17:04  <Parabola> you mind taking a stab at it?
2011-08-12T15:17:11  <lukeis> sure
2011-08-12T15:18:05  <Parabola> http://pastebin.com/2fBQjpLH
2011-08-12T15:18:28  <Parabola> so in theory, the pseduo code provided by lord works, my problem is, i'm so retarded i'm not even sure how to hackjob it (minus syntax)
2011-08-12T15:18:42  <Parabola> the commented stuff is that pseudo code
2011-08-12T15:19:17  <Parabola> the problem is i'd really rather not instanciate new drivers there, i've got a sharedMethods class that has driver setups already in there (note the ie6SetUp(); )
2011-08-12T15:19:42  <Parabola> and i wouldnt ask for more hand holing, but i've been working on this since 1pm, its now 6:30
2011-08-12T15:19:52  <Parabola> i've tried a bunch of my own ways, now im working with this :)
2011-08-12T15:20:05  <lukeis> ok... what does the sharedMethods look like?
2011-08-12T15:20:21  <lukeis> you have a scope problem with that browser variable too
2011-08-12T15:20:43  <lukeis> well, kinda but not... you pass it in and then immediate reset it
2011-08-12T15:20:51  <Parabola> i do? :(
2011-08-12T15:21:14  <lukeis> it's the same as not having that variable and just doing switch (WebTesterMenu.browserReturn) {
2011-08-12T15:21:21  <Parabola> oh gotcha
2011-08-12T15:21:37  *** cakehero has quit IRC
2011-08-12T15:22:09  <Parabola> heres a snippet of sharedMethods
2011-08-12T15:22:09  <Parabola> http://pastebin.com/PX5eXVd7
2011-08-12T15:22:27  <Parabola> theres a setup method for each browser, theres common things, like logins, logouts..ect in there as well
2011-08-12T15:23:10  <lukeis> ok, then i'm guessing you have ie6SetUp as a method, so you would have to call it at some point, why not in your 'runner'
2011-08-12T15:23:25  <lukeis> guess, i'm not clear where the issue is right now
2011-08-12T15:23:34  <Parabola> my runner as in that testRunner (bad name) or in my actual runner (where my main method is)
2011-08-12T15:23:46  <Parabola> the issue is in my head, im brain cramping
2011-08-12T15:24:03  <Parabola> this is my first coding project ever, and i'm struggling not only with syntax and structure, but OO as well
2011-08-12T15:24:25  <lukeis> :) np
2011-08-12T15:25:07  <lukeis> they way you have it you need to have your test runner call a browser setup method... either ff or ie or etc.. that you defined... then you just start using driver for your test
2011-08-12T15:25:11  <Parabola> so i get the first half of the pseudo code (kinda) in that its taking the browser variable (which is the return of a switch statement elsewhere in my code)
2011-08-12T15:25:49  <Parabola> and thats the part I don't get. how do i go take my "set" browser and pass it along to somthing (X) and have it run the test
2011-08-12T15:26:07  <Parabola> if that makes sense
2011-08-12T15:26:13  <lukeis> you don't need to pass the browser, it's a member of the class, you can just use "driver"
2011-08-12T15:26:28  <Parabola> driver, browser, whatever
2011-08-12T15:26:45  <Parabola> i dont really understand the concept of passing data between methods in different classes
2011-08-12T15:26:52  <Parabola> i think thats my biggest issue
2011-08-12T15:26:53  <lukeis> yeah, your variable name is driver (let's just stick with that)
2011-08-12T15:26:58  <lukeis> ok...
2011-08-12T15:27:01  <Parabola> remember i'm a sys admin  :P
2011-08-12T15:27:05  <lukeis> i know :)
2011-08-12T15:27:08  <Parabola> i'm used to very basic perl and bash!
2011-08-12T15:27:43  <Parabola> yeah
2011-08-12T15:28:11  <lukeis> so, a class Instance is an Object that has things on it (methods and members)  your JobRunner class gets instaniated and is an instance of the class with those methods and members in memory
2011-08-12T15:28:50  <lukeis> so that Object retains the scope of it all.... in java (and other OO) you can use member variables inside the methods
2011-08-12T15:29:02  <lukeis> without passing them in the method call
2011-08-12T15:29:41  <lukeis> in java to be explicit you use "this.driver" but if no other local variable name "driver" exists "driver" defaults to the member variable "this.driver"
2011-08-12T15:29:41  <Parabola> member variables = variables within the scope of that instanciated object?
2011-08-12T15:30:11  <lukeis> yes
2011-08-12T15:30:47  <Parabola> alright, i'm not seeing how this relates to my issue, but i follow :)
2011-08-12T15:30:59  <Parabola> (or maybe i don't follow since i dont know how it relates :) )
2011-08-12T15:31:02  <lukeis> so in your case you just need to first call one of the SetUp methods and then call one of your test methods (without passing the driver variable)
2011-08-12T15:31:13  <Parabola> ..thats it?
2011-08-12T15:31:19  <lukeis> and in your test method you can just use "driver"
2011-08-12T15:31:20  <lukeis> yup
2011-08-12T15:31:25  <Parabola> jesus christ
2011-08-12T15:31:27  <Parabola> im going to stab somthing
2011-08-12T15:31:38  <lukeis> ;)
2011-08-12T15:31:51  <lukeis> glad i'm on the other side of the country :)
2011-08-12T15:32:01  <Parabola> so in the first case 1: there
2011-08-12T15:32:10  <Parabola> i have ie6setup. thats all i need there right?
2011-08-12T15:32:14  <lukeis> yep
2011-08-12T15:32:34  <lukeis> now according to the pseudo code you need another case statement that calls the test method
2011-08-12T15:32:37  <Parabola> and then in test runner, say case 1: is a test called boobies();
2011-08-12T15:32:43  <lukeis> yep
2011-08-12T15:32:43  <Parabola> i can just put boobies();
2011-08-12T15:32:49  <lukeis> yep
2011-08-12T15:33:19  <Parabola> in the 2nd method & switch, how will it know that its using ie6setup?
2011-08-12T15:33:20  <lukeis> why do you care about testing birds ;)
2011-08-12T15:33:25  <Parabola> :P
2011-08-12T15:33:31  <Parabola> do i need to pass that driver down somehow?
2011-08-12T15:33:39  <lukeis> it doesn't need to know
2011-08-12T15:33:45  <lukeis> the point is it could be ff
2011-08-12T15:33:51  <lukeis> or ie
2011-08-12T15:33:53  <lukeis> or chrome
2011-08-12T15:34:09  <Parabola> i'm looking at this as if i've got an app that requires 2 args on startup (eg: /usr/bin/RedRobin -name parabola -job CIA)
2011-08-12T15:34:11  <lukeis> the driver is the member variable
2011-08-12T15:34:12  <Parabola> but thats not the case is it?
2011-08-12T15:34:34  <Parabola> I think i'm starting to see
2011-08-12T15:35:20  <lukeis> so the parameters you are passing in initially (which driver, which test) don't need to go everywhere, they just need to go to the relevant methods to do their 'job'
2011-08-12T15:35:26  <Parabola> okay
2011-08-12T15:35:37  <Parabola> and for the testRunner method, hes passing in "seleniumrunner"
2011-08-12T15:35:45  <Parabola> in my case, do i just put "driver" there?
2011-08-12T15:36:01  <lukeis> you don't need that parameter at all
2011-08-12T15:36:06  <lukeis> since it's a member of the class
2011-08-12T15:36:49  *** sfbrian_ has joined #selenium
2011-08-12T15:37:11  <lukeis> there's no point to having two methods... here testRunner and tester1... should just be 1

2011-08-12T15:40:48  <Parabola> so, you commented out my browser = line
2011-08-12T15:40:51  <Parabola> is there a reason?
2011-08-12T15:40:59  <Parabola> doesnt the param have to be dealt with?
2011-08-12T15:41:19  *** Siph0n has quit IRC
2011-08-12T15:41:24  <lukeis> so either you are going to use that static variable WebTesterMenu.browserReturn and get rid of the "browser" parameter
2011-08-12T15:41:38  <lukeis> or use what i had
2011-08-12T15:42:32  <lukeis> look again, this is what i'm saying if you're going to use that static variable
2011-08-12T15:42:57  <lukeis> and if you make "test" a similar static then you don't need any params
2011-08-12T15:43:06  <Parabola> hmm
2011-08-12T15:43:32  <lukeis> when you add another case to the first switch, be sure to add a "break;" to the end of the first one ;)
2011-08-12T15:43:55  <lukeis> (otherwise case 1 will execute case 1 and 2)
2011-08-12T15:44:03  *** adamgoucher has joined #selenium
2011-08-12T15:44:13  <Parabola> i'm really confused
2011-08-12T15:44:17  <lukeis> :(
2011-08-12T15:44:20  <Parabola> if i do it your way
2011-08-12T15:44:30  <Parabola> its resolving to a local parameter
2011-08-12T15:44:39  <Parabola> browser doesnt mean anything, right?
2011-08-12T15:44:51  <Parabola> the return from the method I want to use is actually browserResult
2011-08-12T15:44:52  <Parabola> or some shti
2011-08-12T15:45:02  <Parabola> browserReturn
2011-08-12T15:45:03  <Parabola> thats it
2011-08-12T15:45:12  <Parabola> if i have (int browser) then switch (browser)
2011-08-12T15:45:19  <Parabola> how is java asigning anything to it/

2011-08-12T15:45:29  <Parabola> ooo
2011-08-12T15:45:32  <Parabola> that makes 100% sense now
2011-08-12T15:45:41  <Parabola> you were making me doubt the little i thought I did know
2011-08-12T15:45:46  <lukeis> haha
2011-08-12T15:45:49  <lukeis> sorry
2011-08-12T15:46:04  <Parabola> well hell
2011-08-12T15:46:08  <Parabola> i could do the same thing with int test
2011-08-12T15:46:12  <Parabola> I don't need that either
2011-08-12T15:46:14  <Parabola> :)
2011-08-12T15:46:19  <lukeis> yeah, that's what i was trying to say ;)
2011-08-12T15:46:47  <Parabola> :P
2011-08-12T15:47:10  <lukeis> of course... this is completely not the way i do it :)
2011-08-12T15:48:03  <Parabola> ...
2011-08-12T15:48:15  <Parabola> is there a better way?
2011-08-12T15:48:15  <lukeis> a co-worker of mine wrote an extension of testng.... https://github.com/rexhoffman/test-extensions
2011-08-12T15:48:22  <lukeis> there's MANY ways ;)
2011-08-12T15:48:36  <lukeis> most would be better than what you are doing
2011-08-12T15:48:48  <Parabola> figures
2011-08-12T15:48:53  <Parabola> i still win, its most not all
2011-08-12T15:49:13  <Parabola> i'm sure after a few months of coding things i'll be able to rewrite this in a much better way
2011-08-12T15:49:22  <Parabola> oh you should see my actual tests :D
2011-08-12T15:49:27  <Parabola> sec ill kill your brain with a pastebin

2011-08-12T15:51:14  <Parabola> I know its nasty, I was thinking storing the tests themselfs in XML, and just writing a parser
2011-08-12T15:51:26  <Parabola> but i'd cure HIV before i'd figure that out right now
2011-08-12T15:51:36  <lukeis> ouch... so many double lookups of webelements
2011-08-12T15:51:49  <Parabola> oh yeah
2011-08-12T15:51:56  <Parabola> its how i finagled it to work
2011-08-12T15:52:02  <lukeis> :)
2011-08-12T15:52:13  <Parabola> i'd like to just do a driver.click();
2011-08-12T15:52:15  <Parabola> or somthing
2011-08-12T15:52:27  <lukeis> there's ways... next week we can talk again

2011-08-12T15:53:21  <Parabola> the one test I did export, i ended up manually writing the missing parts
2011-08-12T15:53:52  <Nogem> that's exactly what I'm looking to do, that's why I'm looking for the reference material
2011-08-12T15:55:22  <Parabola> I haven't seen one mate

2011-08-12T16:16:25  <Parabola> are you using remoteWebDriver?
2011-08-12T16:16:28  <Parabola> or is this local
2011-08-12T16:18:13  <Nogem> local
2011-08-12T16:18:28  <Parabola> Nogem:  you might find this useful also: http://pastebin.com/CwNZXmhG
2011-08-12T16:19:49  <Nogem> throw that element check into each test set?
2011-08-12T16:20:02  <Parabola> thats what i'm using it for
2011-08-12T16:20:55  <gordolio> found an error in the JsonWireProtocol documentation...  I am willing to fix it in the generator for that page...
2011-08-12T16:21:04  <gordolio> just wondering what the best route to follow is.
2011-08-12T16:21:15  <gordolio> log a bug... fix it myself and send a patch?
2011-08-12T16:21:45  <Parabola> i'm not sure mate
2011-08-12T16:22:01  <Parabola> response time on issue reports is pretty darn good
2011-08-12T16:22:13  <Parabola> i'd say it doesnt matter, if you fix somthing for them they'll take it however :)
2011-08-12T16:22:35  <gordolio> excellent. as far as patches go... what's the best route?
2011-08-12T16:22:39  <gordolio> log a bug and attach a patch?
2011-08-12T16:22:47  <gordolio> s/bug/issue/
2011-08-12T16:22:53  <Parabola> thats what i would do, but i'm by no means an authoritive source
2011-08-12T16:23:08  <gordolio> I see.
2011-08-12T16:23:12  <gordolio> seems to be the best thing.
2011-08-12T16:23:17  <gordolio> that's what I'll do.
2011-08-12T16:23:19  <Parabola> the devs are very active here
2011-08-12T16:23:20  <Parabola> they will see it
2011-08-12T16:23:25  <Parabola>  with any method you do :)
2011-08-12T16:23:38  <gordolio> ok, ya.
2011-08-12T16:23:44  <gordolio> fyi.. the problem is in http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/alert_text
2011-08-12T16:24:03  <gordolio> the POST method accepts 'text' for the key json parameter
2011-08-12T16:24:11  <gordolio> and not 'keysToSend'
2011-08-12T16:28:18  <Parabola> oh lovely
2011-08-12T16:28:23  <Parabola> good catch mate :)
2011-08-12T16:28:49  <gordolio> ya, I had to search the ruby webdriver to find what the proper one was.. heh.

2011-08-12T16:45:55  <Parabola> np :) just wondering, was this generated by the IDE?
2011-08-12T16:45:58  <Parabola> it looks like it was
2011-08-12T16:47:07  <Nogem> originally yeah, that's what I'm working to fix
2011-08-12T16:47:09  <adamgoucher> log any bugs with the webdriver export and assign them to samit :)
2011-08-12T16:47:27  <adamgoucher> not my fault ftw :)
2011-08-12T16:47:43  <Nogem> so I should file that stack trace and send it to samit?
2011-08-12T16:48:39  <Parabola> hm
2011-08-12T16:48:46  <Parabola> does the browser launch at all on your test runs
2011-08-12T16:50:16  <Nogem> what test runs? Just getting started but I imagine I'm going to see the same thing in my other cases. They're all IDE export and using FireFox at this point.
2011-08-12T16:50:26  <adamgoucher> put it in a bug
2011-08-12T16:50:52  <Nogem> suppose I could try using a different driver, but I half suspect there's going to be a setup issue at the core of this
