2011-07-27T00:44:38  <ArmEagle> huh.. can see fields but they don't exist? That's some magical browser
2011-07-27T00:45:07  <ArmEagle> The other side of the spectrum.. today we had a customer who first said he was using Windows 8.. ended up being IE8 in XP
2011-07-27T00:45:25  <ArmEagle> and the layout was missing background images and most/all styling
2011-07-27T00:45:41  <ArmEagle> no wonder he encountered issues.. it's amazing he even managed to try and use it
2011-07-27T00:45:55  <ArmEagle> We're recommending him to either fix his system or try either Firefox or Chrome

2011-07-27T02:31:29  <dawagner> Hi Ajay
2011-07-27T02:32:13  <Ajay> i need a quick info on getAllFields()
2011-07-27T02:33:15  <dawagner> ok, what do you need?
2011-07-27T02:34:07  <Ajay> From the Documentation , getAllFields should return the ID of all input fields on a page , An input field can be of any type , but the current implementation returns ids of type text only
2011-07-27T02:34:28  <Ajay> Are there any specific reason filtering of type = text ?
2011-07-27T02:35:20  <dawagner> At a guess, an instant reaction to "fields" would perhaps make me assume "text fields", and it's probably useful to people
2011-07-27T02:35:36  <dawagner> *shrug* the whole 1.0 API is large and designed for special cases
2011-07-27T02:37:28  <Ajay> Oh.. k , i was planning to take up #1228

2011-07-27T07:05:38  <eranm> Funny, I was about to talk about Firefox 3.0.
2011-07-27T07:07:32  <eranm> adamgoucher, I think AutomatedTester found some issues on untrusted SSL certificates with Firefox 6, apparently a patch that was reverted for the 5.0 release and should be reverted from 6 as well
2011-07-27T07:07:54  <eranm> I don't know of anything else blocking support for Firefox 6
2011-07-27T07:08:07  <adamgoucher> nods. i recall reading that bug.
2011-07-27T07:08:19  <adamgoucher> do we know if that effects webdriver only or rc as well?

2011-07-27T07:12:54  <gradecke> Hi everybody - I know that it's contrary of the unit-test idea, and that some people have worked around it by leaving one selenium object open for all their test, but I don't have that choice, thus: Is there a way to run selenium tests (using java and selenium rc) and connecting to an instance of the browser that selenium has opened before?

2011-07-27T07:22:41  <gradecke> cgp_: yeah, I thought about that, but at least for java, the session id isn't visible - not sure how complicated it would be to set up the object manually if I had the sessionId
2011-07-27T07:22:49  <adamgoucher> heh. kW_ we just talked about it. we /think/ that it might work if you dont use untrusted certificates. not sure if they have upped the maxversion in the xpi though.

2011-07-27T07:39:08  <sdimkov> but pretty much the same setup
2011-07-27T07:40:05  <sdimkov> right now I can't figure out why my ff times out. driver#get   throws timeout , although it loads the application fine.. And that only happens on one of my boxes.
2011-07-27T07:40:34  <MattR> I can see firefox start up but then the BadRequest error - I fear it's something network related to trying to connect back to 7055 - is this something on the client?

2011-07-27T07:52:24  <DarkRift> Something else about IE then
2011-07-27T07:52:30  <jimevans> See http://groups.google.com/group/webdriver/browse_thread/thread/d7ad5c4c0de5d9e9# for my cranky description of why.
2011-07-27T07:52:56  <DarkRift> if you resize to get a full canvas, I get a black image on the bottomt when the canvas is bigger than the screen, is it a known issue as well ?
2011-07-27T07:53:30  <DarkRift> if the page scrolls down the screen, the part I can't see is black, which isn't a problem on chrome or FF
2011-07-27T07:53:39  <jimevans> See the previously mentioned email thread.

2011-07-27T07:56:59  <MattR> Ok sdimkov - looks like 7055 is the port used by the Firefox Extension which enables communication with client...in the case of remote webdriver presumably this is remote webdriver instance

2011-07-27T08:49:34  <new2b2> Hi. If I have 2 files (A test script, and this script calls a function that's in another file), how can I tell the 2nd file to use the same browser session as the first. What's the variable I have to pass to it? (using webdriver)
2011-07-27T08:49:56  <new2b2> with selenium RC I saved session_id variable and passed that, but not sure how to do that with webdriver
2011-07-27T08:50:13  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-07-27T08:50:42  <jimevans> new2b2: pass the variable holding the driver instance. that is, you've probably got something like the following (Java example):
2011-07-27T08:50:53  <jimevans> WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();
2011-07-27T08:51:03  <donald650> make the  webdriver instance a public static variable and it can be called anywhere
2011-07-27T08:51:05  <jimevans> pass the driver variable to the other methods.

2011-07-27T09:02:21  <jimevans> new2b2: xpath is another solution XRayCulver could use too. I recommend CSS selectors because they're faster in IE.

2011-07-27T09:03:50  <XRayCulver> seems to have worked

2011-07-27T09:05:14  <jimevans> XRayCulver: Glad that worked. If the page under test is structured that way, you're golden.
2011-07-27T09:05:25  <XRayCulver> i noticed findElements() is similar to jquery
2011-07-27T09:05:42  <jimevans> for css selectors, similar, but not completely.
2011-07-27T09:05:44  <XRayCulver> i'm just now learning javascript/jquery
2011-07-27T09:06:05  <jimevans> there are sizzle (jquery's css selector engine) pseudo classes that aren't part of the CSS selectors standard
2011-07-27T09:06:21  <jimevans> :contains() being the one that trips most people up.
2011-07-27T09:06:27  <XRayCulver> ah
2011-07-27T09:06:41  <jimevans> :contains() isn't in the standard. don't use it.

2011-07-27T09:14:54  <jimevans> it wouldn't be that hard to expose the delegate of the By class. not quite the same thing, but close.
2011-07-27T09:16:02  <jimevans> right now those implementations are private, but should maybe allow protected setters.
2011-07-27T09:16:09  <XRayCulver> ah

2011-07-27T10:17:14  <jimevans> donald650: you're correct. there's no isElementPresent function in the Selenium WebDriver API

2011-07-27T10:23:24  <simonstewart> You tend to poll until it's there, then use it
2011-07-27T10:23:45  <simonstewart> implicit waits (and explicit ones) fill that gap
2011-07-27T10:24:20  <simonstewart> the other thing is a "I expect this to be present, and I want the test to fail if it's not"
2011-07-27T10:24:28  <simonstewart> which is handled by the default behvaiour

2011-07-27T13:13:27  <jimevans> DarkRift: yes?
2011-07-27T13:14:13  <DarkRift> I was thinking about the IE resize ... wouldn't it be better for the resize to only resize it if you detect the page would be bigger than the currently browser size and if the browser already covers the canvas, then don't touch it ?
2011-07-27T13:15:13  <DarkRift> would that be an option so it's never smaller than the size we set the browser to ?
2011-07-27T13:16:15  <jimevans> i suppose.
2011-07-27T13:17:44  <jimevans> honestly, i've not given it that much thought. mainly, i wanted to quiet all of the whining^h^h^h^h^h^h^h suggestions that IE should provide full-canvas screenshots when it didn't do so before.
2011-07-27T13:17:53  <DarkRift> ok
2011-07-27T13:19:15  *** netcarver has quit IRC
2011-07-27T13:20:02  <DarkRift> I see the whining can be an as... to deal with.  People always want it their way... options could be provided to decide the behavior of the browser as well... I don't know, just some thoughts to cover what everyone wants
2011-07-27T13:21:08  <jimevans> I apologize if I seem sensitive on the subject. There are times when I (incorrectly) perceive a sense of entitlement to people who use Selenium when it doesn't work *just* how they want it to.
2011-07-27T13:21:50  <jimevans> and they often don't realize that (1) i'm a volunteer on the project; I don't get paid to work on Selenium,
2011-07-27T13:22:10  <DarkRift> I understand that point
2011-07-27T13:22:13  <jimevans> and (2) it's an open source project, and I see lots of suggestions, but relatively few patches.
2011-07-27T13:23:29  <nirvdrum> jimevans: But we all love you.
2011-07-27T13:24:12  <DarkRift> jimevans I can understand your point of view really well, being volunteer ain't an easy task to deal with suggestions and find solutions to solve everyone's case.
2011-07-27T13:24:42  <DarkRift> and it's not always funny to do a volunteer job and people always complain about it's not doing it the way they want it
2011-07-27T13:25:08  <DarkRift> I'll try to take a look at the code see if I can manage something
2011-07-27T13:26:31  <jimevans> in this case it's a pretty easy fix.
2011-07-27T13:26:52  *** angshu has quit IRC
2011-07-27T13:27:28  <jimevans> in ScreenshotCommandHandler.h, long about line 113 or so, put in a check for current browser height and width.
2011-07-27T13:27:47  <DarkRift> have to say you did a good job on it tho, so I have nothing to complain about.
2011-07-27T13:28:15  <nirvdrum> jimevans: Unfortunately it's a bit trickier than that.  Although that'll work most of the time.
2011-07-27T13:28:21  <jimevans> thanks. you'd be one of the few that has nothing to complain about. i've got lots to complain about.
2011-07-27T13:28:50  <jimevans> nirvdrum: how so?
2011-07-27T13:29:32  <nirvdrum> jimevans: I came across an odd situation lately that I need to deal with in SnapsIE.  The body had a "height = 100%" attribute.  IE then reports the body height as the height of the viewport.  But the document height will be correct.
2011-07-27T13:29:54  <nirvdrum> But depending what render mode you're in, you're supposed to use the body tag to be equivalent to the document.
2011-07-27T13:30:06  <nirvdrum> That's about as far as I got with it.
2011-07-27T13:30:12  <nirvdrum> I haven't had time to dig in further.
2011-07-27T13:30:29  <nirvdrum> But that may be the only corner case.
2011-07-27T13:30:31  <jimevans> right, i'm already taking that into account (using mostly your code).
2011-07-27T13:30:32  <nirvdrum> I don't really know.
2011-07-27T13:31:10  <jimevans> there's a ScreenshotCommandHandler::GetDocumentDimensions() function that does the "check the compatibility mode" dance
2011-07-27T13:31:27  *** soc42 has quit IRC
2011-07-27T13:32:12  <nirvdrum> Actually, thinking on it more, I've tested 500K+ pages with snapsie and the total that are messed up is probably < 20.
2011-07-27T13:32:21  <nirvdrum> So it's really not that big a deal.
2011-07-27T13:32:38  <nirvdrum> I'm sure somewhere along the line, we'll find that one person that will complain.
2011-07-27T13:32:49  <jimevans> lol. no doubt.
