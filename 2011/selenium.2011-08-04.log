2011-08-04T05:24:49  <Ajay> i ran a set of tests looks fine :)
2011-08-04T05:26:24  <sburjan> it seems that Mouse Actions don't actually move t he cursor, is that normal ? Se2 on Java
2011-08-04T05:26:42  <dawagner> sburjan: No, it does not, because then you couldn't run tests in parallel
2011-08-04T05:26:52  <dawagner> But it sends the right messages at the OS level to make the browser thing that it has

2011-08-04T05:31:55  *** OperaDriver has left #selenium
2011-08-04T05:33:08  <eranm> sburjan, the cursor itself won't be moving, but the browser will be getting the right events (assuming you're using Firefox with native events enabled, which is the default on Windows)
2011-08-04T05:33:26  <sburjan> basically I hover/click on a element. The mouse remains hovering over the WebElement. A js modal appears. now I have to move the mouse away from that WebElement in order to make that modal disappear. And I can't manage to do this
2011-08-04T05:34:18  <sburjan> I t ried with builder.moveByOffset(1000, 1000).build().perform(); .. still nothing
2011-08-04T05:34:51  <sburjan> and I don't know how to do the trick
2011-08-04T05:34:55  <sburjan> no ideas
2011-08-04T05:36:08  <sburjan> clicking the thml body doesn't seem to move the mouse, clicking the mouse on a non-clickable element doesn't seem to work either
2011-08-04T05:36:23  <dawagner> sburjan: Is it an actual javascript modal (i.e. an alert/prompt/similar), or something similar put up by a framework?
2011-08-04T05:36:46  <sburjan> something put by framework. so it's not an alert window generated by browser. it's pute js
2011-08-04T05:36:57  <sburjan> *pure
2011-08-04T05:37:39  <sburjan> of course, refreshing the page might do it, but it would defeat the purpose of the test

2011-08-04T05:48:44  <AutomatedTester> I will see about merging it in]
2011-08-04T05:48:54  <dawagner> sburjan: Alas no - if you can supply a reduced test case showing an event not firing that you're expecting, we can look at it
2011-08-04T05:49:30  <krosenvold1> AutomatedTester: OOooo! I can actually merge that patch into our copy of httpd.js and test it !
2011-08-04T05:49:41  <eranm> sburjan, move to another element?
2011-08-04T05:49:49  <AutomatedTester> krosenvold1: go for it :)
2011-08-04T05:49:55  <krosenvold1> AutomatedTester: Best of all, wife and kids are away !!!
2011-08-04T05:50:04  <sburjan> eranm: let me try
2011-08-04T05:50:21  <eranm> sburjan, sounds to me like that's how a user would do it...
2011-08-04T05:50:52  <jarib> krosenvold1: woo, that'd be fantastic
2011-08-04T05:51:16  <eranm> and the code for native event generation will generate a mouse move event every 5 (or 10?) pixels so assuming the mouse was not moved just past the border of the element causing the modal, the modal should get a mouseout event
2011-08-04T05:51:26  <krosenvold1> jarib It seems like the guys have spent *some* energy on that patch. I tried for like 30 minutes ;)

2011-08-04T08:02:41  <jimevans> Hi
2011-08-04T08:03:15  <XRayCulver> thanks for fixing the nuget issue
2011-08-04T08:03:17  <Stuk> simonstewart: yeah, are we also meant to support finding sub-frames? "one.two" would find frame "two" inside frame "one"?
2011-08-04T08:03:25  <jimevans> XRayCulver: Np
2011-08-04T08:04:05  <simonstewart> We changed the behaviour a while ago
2011-08-04T08:04:11  <simonstewart> That's how we used to find frames
2011-08-04T08:04:16  <simonstewart> Are there still tests that say that?
2011-08-04T08:04:36  <Stuk> no :) but it was the behaviour I just removed so was wondering
2011-08-04T08:04:54  <simonstewart> Yeah. Turned out that we ran into frames with dots in the names
2011-08-04T08:05:07  <Stuk> ha, and hence the change
2011-08-04T08:05:11  <simonstewart> :)
2011-08-04T08:05:17  <simonstewart> Also, it was confusing as heck

2011-08-04T09:03:28  <XRayCulver> anybody have a suggestion for a workaround for my issue described at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/selenium-users/RC_FgegZNv4
2011-08-04T09:04:31  <randy_> Hi, I'm going through getting set-up with WebDriver and just ran into a frustrating dependency issue with the sample pom.xml provided at http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html
2011-08-04T09:05:49  <randy_> the selenium-ei-driver depends on jna 3.3.0 which isn't on maven central, might be good to modify the exmaple pom to be something like https://gist.github.com/1125537 (note I've only 1st started using maven today so I don't know if there is a better way)
2011-08-04T09:09:42  <simonstewart> randy_ depend on 2.3.1

2011-08-04T09:12:46  <Ajay_> be updated
2011-08-04T09:12:59  <randy_> Yea not claiming to be an expert my any means, but my build path definately was not happy and said that it couldn't find the dependency for 3.3.0
2011-08-04T09:13:20  <lukeis> randy_: to be expected use 2.3.1 instead of 2.3.0
2011-08-04T09:14:09  <Ajay_> lukeis:hi

2011-08-04T12:20:20  <nirvdrum> But I suspect we have a few multithreaded problems.
2011-08-04T12:20:46  <krosenvold> Yes, I'm spending the usual 3 hours getting the tests anywhere /near/ running on my machine
2011-08-04T12:21:05  <krosenvold> that I always seem to do when I'm trying to do something on selenium
2011-08-04T12:21:59  <krosenvold> Do you know where the RemoteProxy is actually used ?
2011-08-04T12:22:12  <krosenvold> Should a single instance of a remoteproxy handle concurrent access?
2011-08-04T12:22:29  <nirvdrum> A RemoteProxy is the interface by which the hub communicates with nodes.
2011-08-04T12:22:36  <nirvdrum> RemoteProxy is effectively a node.
2011-08-04T12:22:49  <krosenvold> And does the hub always come in on the same thread ?
2011-08-04T12:22:51  <nirvdrum> A node can concurrently run tests, each one being assigned to a TestSlot.

2011-08-04T12:24:15  <randy_> sorry if this is sent twice, client messed up. Is it possible/is there documetation on how to set proxy for each of the WebDriver types?
2011-08-04T12:24:21  <nirvdrum> The hub itself is composed of various components.  There should only be a single Registry.  But the hub is mostly represented as servlet that wraps around the registry.
2011-08-04T12:24:27  <krosenvold> I'm approaching the fourth hour just trying to build on my machine ;(
2011-08-04T12:24:28  <nirvdrum> The servlet is naturally multithreaded.
2011-08-04T12:24:58  <krosenvold> Hm. In that case the RemoteProxy is buggy as hell.
2011-08-04T12:25:02  <nirvdrum> krosenvold: I'll have to pull from master.  The last time I tried running the grid tests they passed.  But I've never had the entire test suite passing for me.
2011-08-04T12:25:12  <jarib_> krosenvold: wow
2011-08-04T12:25:38  * jarib_ didn't realize it was that bad
2011-08-04T12:25:58  <krosenvold> The problem is that I run 64 bit jvm and I have 6 cores, which means I get every thread safety issue there is to be had
2011-08-04T12:25:59  <nirvdrum> krosenvold: I think all the accesses to the proxy are wrapped with ReentrantLock.
2011-08-04T12:26:05  <nirvdrum> But I'd have to audit it to be sure.

2011-08-04T12:26:23  <krosenvold> That makes sense, in which case it's just the test being incorrect. I can fix the test
2011-08-04T12:27:10  <nirvdrum> I'm not convinced we're doing the fastest thing, but it should mostly be safe.  Nonetheless there is some amount of state that gets confused under load that I need to work out.
2011-08-04T12:27:34  <nirvdrum> We also had issues with permanent threads dying and there being no watchdog to respawn.
2011-08-04T12:29:21  <krosenvold> I basically started just going through all the tests that new Thread() reading each one
2011-08-04T12:29:55  <nirvdrum> Ooh.  I can't build Selenium with Java 7.  That's cute.

2011-08-04T12:36:40  <krosenvold> Yes, well maybe. The division bugs in intel cpus only had a couple of bad cases too
2011-08-04T12:37:12  <nirvdrum> I also thought it was a runtime issue, too.  But I didn't really look into it.
2011-08-04T12:37:46  <krosenvold> Yes, it's the jvm optimizer. But that's always there unless you run with the -client option ;)
2011-08-04T12:38:10  <krosenvold> No actually, it's a different option to disable it
