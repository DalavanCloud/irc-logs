2011-05-23T02:01:34  <tcarpentier> hello, i'm using selenium2 with python, and i don"t find the way to select a value into a listbox.

2011-05-23T02:06:34  <AutomatedTester> tcarpentier: you need to find the select and then find the option in it
2011-05-23T02:07:24  <AutomatedTester> myOptions = driver.find_element_by_id("mySelect").find_elements_by_tag("option")
2011-05-23T02:07:35  <AutomatedTester> myOptions[1].click()
2011-05-23T02:08:17  <tcarpentier> Automatedtester : Thanks...i will try
2011-05-23T02:08:39  <tcarpentier> for the moment i've just try : self.browser.find_element_by_name("refProductType")
2011-05-23T02:09:11  <tcarpentier> but after , if i do "click",; nothing happens, so I will try you answer..
2011-05-23T02:09:59  <AutomatedTester> tcarpentier: if each of your options have id's you can do it that way
2011-05-23T02:10:40  <tcarpentier> string "option" is the tag or the value ?
2011-05-23T02:12:09  *** bebef_1987 has quit IRC

2011-05-23T02:25:40  <tcarpentier> it's seems to be better with self.browser.find_element_by_id("slt_popupProductTO").find_elements_by_tag_name("option")
2011-05-23T02:26:28  <AutomatedTester> tcarpentier: remember in the REPL you can see what methods are available by doing a dir(object) where object could be browser or webelement

2011-05-23T02:31:57  <AutomatedTester> lets not go too far
2011-05-23T02:32:29  <AutomatedTester> can you point me to the files that load firefox for test-core?
2011-05-23T02:32:38  <simonstewart> who? me?
2011-05-23T02:32:38  <tcarpentier> AutomaterTester : Ok...i will stay here for a moment i think ;) Hope selenium will be help me to make good tests !
2011-05-23T02:32:46  * AutomatedTester is going to make Se1 Firefox 5 compatable today
2011-05-23T02:33:05  <AutomatedTester> and then move on to Se2
2011-05-23T02:33:14  <AutomatedTester> and probably upset Eran :)
2011-05-23T02:33:14  <simonstewart> Once we get 2.0 out the door, I'm very tempted to stop trying to maintain se1 against new browsers
2011-05-23T02:33:28  <simonstewart> How are you going to upset Eran?
2011-05-23T02:33:56  <AutomatedTester> because his Advanced Users API will probably break :D
2011-05-23T02:34:12  <simonstewart> He should have got the release out sooner
2011-05-23T02:34:21  <simonstewart> I have exactly zero sympathy
2011-05-23T02:35:12  <AutomatedTester> so simonstewart pointers to test-core browser loading code?
2011-05-23T02:35:25  <simonstewart> javascript/selenium-core
2011-05-23T02:35:36  <AutomatedTester> danke
2011-05-23T02:35:56  <AutomatedTester> hmmm svn up taking longer than expected
2011-05-23T02:36:07  <simonstewart> It's okay here
2011-05-23T02:36:24  <AutomatedTester> i havent done it in a few days

2011-05-23T02:37:31  <AutomatedTester> last time I checked it didnt
2011-05-23T02:37:39  <AutomatedTester> remember I was asking the other day?
2011-05-23T02:37:48  <simonstewart> I've a crappy memory
2011-05-23T02:37:55  * AutomatedTester is looking into it for next few days
2011-05-23T02:37:59  <simonstewart> It's the only way I've found to remember tricia for pub quizzes
2011-05-23T02:38:00  <AutomatedTester> so starting with Se1
2011-05-23T02:38:06  <simonstewart> start with se2
2011-05-23T02:38:19  <simonstewart> go on, go on, go on
2011-05-23T02:38:22  <AutomatedTester> i reckon Se1 will be easier to solve
2011-05-23T02:38:22  <simonstewart> :)
2011-05-23T02:38:35  <simonstewart> I think it'll be just a bump in the install.rdf for us
2011-05-23T02:38:44  <simonstewart> And se1 was harder to get working last time
2011-05-23T02:38:54  <AutomatedTester> Se2 is being pants and telling me a variable is undefined when I try define it
2011-05-23T02:39:03  <AutomatedTester> i have done the install.rdf stuff
2011-05-23T02:39:06  <simonstewart> eh?
2011-05-23T02:39:09  <simonstewart> Oh ok
2011-05-23T02:39:16  <simonstewart> Well, whatever you feel is best

2011-05-23T03:12:16  <simonstewart> Oui
2011-05-23T03:12:47  <simonstewart> WebDriver emails dealt with.
2011-05-23T03:12:50  <simonstewart> Bugs now
2011-05-23T03:13:15  <freynaud> anyone here got experience with the pooling of  DefaultHTTPClient ?
2011-05-23T03:13:23  <simonstewart> nope
2011-05-23T03:13:33  <simonstewart> Or rather, not me
2011-05-23T03:14:38  <freynaud> any idea who could help me ? The issue I think I have is that connection are saved by destination or soemthing similar. So when you revert a VM, the connection is closed, but the pool still tries to use it. And Boom again
2011-05-23T03:14:58  <simonstewart> The apache httpclient mailing list?
2011-05-23T03:16:00  <freynaud> i'll try that. In the meantime I think I'll put a way to remote the pool completly in case people face the same issue
2011-05-23T03:16:14  <freynaud> remoVe
2011-05-23T03:16:28  <simonstewart> Why not catch the exception, forcibly close the connection and recurse?
2011-05-23T03:17:07  <freynaud> i need to find a way to let the pool know he needs to recreate the connection
2011-05-23T03:17:15  <simonstewart> ^^
2011-05-23T03:17:26  <freynaud> at the moment it stays in the pool, and keep throwing connection close
2011-05-23T03:17:42  <freynaud> I can catch them , but that doesn't really solve it :)
2011-05-23T03:17:55  <simonstewart> If you have a reference to the connection you can close it, right?
2011-05-23T03:17:59  <freynaud> or catch ( create new ) , but that's not really the point of a pool
2011-05-23T03:18:23  <simonstewart> It's an exceptional condition though
2011-05-23T03:18:33  <freynaud> I was hoping for an easy fix

2011-05-23T03:46:27  <kondal> 1.0.3
2011-05-23T03:47:29  <simonstewart> The 2.0b3 contains a modern version of selenium, and it's got a lot of bug fixes in
2011-05-23T03:47:37  <kondal> ok, thank you , will try and let you know
2011-05-23T03:47:38  <simonstewart> Try that first to see if it helps
2011-05-23T03:47:40  <simonstewart> Thanks
2011-05-23T03:48:41  <kondal> 2.0.b3 standalone ?
2011-05-23T03:48:47  <simonstewart> Yes

2011-05-23T04:01:40  <simonstewart> *firefox should work as expected
2011-05-23T04:01:50  <simonstewart> And webdriver will too (with Firefox, IE and Chrome)

2011-05-23T04:03:47  <simonstewart> You can try passing in the flag that disables web security to chrome
2011-05-23T04:04:01  <simonstewart> (which I can't remember right now)
2011-05-23T04:04:08  <simonstewart> google chrome disable web security

2011-05-23T04:09:01  <simonstewart> There should be a third_party/java/opera-driver directory

2011-05-23T05:28:52  <tcarpentier> RossPatterson : i've started automation with HP QTP , so selenium is new for me
2011-05-23T05:30:40  *** cburroughs` has joined #selenium
2011-05-23T05:31:44  <freynaud> tcarpentier: same here. yes, thousands ( however the the number a methods we have to maintain is way lower, we're using java + testNG to test, and pass parameters to have one methodf testign several sites etc). Most issues were around : how to move from a team of manual testers to a team writing code.
2011-05-23T05:32:24  <curseg> freynaud: how did you do that successfully? re: how to move from a team of manual testers to a team writing code.
2011-05-23T05:32:55  <curseg> i'm in the process of getting some outside selenium training and having a classroom type setting in the office to train the manual testers
2011-05-23T05:33:47  <freynaud> curseg: it took time and we didn't move the complete team, only a subset
2011-05-23T05:35:52  <curseg> how did you distribute the knowledge transfer freynaud?
2011-05-23T05:37:08  <freynaud> write code, code review, explain the changes and have some helpers done for everybody to use
2011-05-23T05:37:38  <freynaud> nothing special really, writing the test becomes a mini software project, so you apply the same thing
2011-05-23T05:38:20  <curseg> i guess the real question is did your team have general code writing skills prior
2011-05-23T05:39:36  <freynaud> yes

2011-05-23T05:49:22  <freynaud> as I said, it becomes a software project. You write shitty code , maintenance will be high. You use page objects and you maintenance decreases
2011-05-23T05:49:27  <tcarpentier> for the moment in my company, we are only 2 at the QA team,my speciality is the automation, and my colleague is a manual tester

2011-05-23T05:52:24  <jarib> well, except the second link :P
2011-05-23T05:52:36  <freynaud> using page object will allow you to do maintenance only in one place, instead of duplicating the effort if you use a selenese + IDE approach
2011-05-23T05:53:01  <curseg> seems like the css to html to me, just from what i've been hearing.. I haven't really looked much into it yet

2011-05-23T05:54:27  <tcarpentier> RossPatterson  : Apart from the price ;)
2011-05-23T05:55:59  <freynaud> you don't have to learn a new language for testing, it's easy to integrate with anything else

2011-05-23T06:08:54  <selbot`> New news from builds: S2RB-WDUNIT-99 was SUCCESSFUL (with 54 tests) : Updated by Jari Bakken <http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/S2RB-WDUNIT-99>
2011-05-23T06:09:05  <RossPatterson> tcarpentier: QTP encouraged a lot of repetition.  Our QTP tests (and the QC scripts they grew up from) had a lot of what programmers recognize as duplicated code.  And when application changes made them invalid, there was a LOT of repair necessary.  The same people naturally started to write the same test code in Selenium.  We needed to change that mindset.
2011-05-23T06:10:09  <RossPatterson> Luckily, we completely skipped over Selenium IDE and went straight to Selenium RC, which meant our test authors were writing real code (C# in our case), not IDE's "Selenese" command language.

2011-05-23T06:16:01  <tcarpentier> RossPatterson : Ok. thanks...I don"t use IDE too, I think it's better to write "real code" to do that I want !!
2011-05-23T06:17:13  <RossPatterson> tcarpentier: We find that Selenium is a "real automation system", in that we can run tests much more frequently and reliably.  Thus we run about 1,000 functional tests (not merely unit tests - we've got lots of those too) every time a developer checks in an update to the application.  QTP tests never seem to be solid enough for that, and often require a human to be watching, even if QTP is driving the mouse and keyboard.  Our CI
2011-05-23T06:17:13  <RossPatterson> system (JetBrain's TeamCity) runs dozens of Selenium jobs every day, and we only look at them if something fails.
2011-05-23T06:19:22  <tcarpentier> 1,000 functional tests ? how much time to run all of them?
2011-05-23T06:20:06  <RossPatterson> About 7 hours, but we run lots of them in parallel, so more like 30 minutes.
2011-05-23T06:20:16  <tcarpentier> I remenber when i used QTP, i have about 1,000 tests, and it tkaes 9 hours
2011-05-23T06:20:28  <tcarpentier> Ok
2011-05-23T06:21:15  <RossPatterson> That's another important part of the CI+automation strategy: only use humans to do human-sized tasks, use machines to do boring or large tasks.
2011-05-23T06:21:17  <tcarpentier> and you run them at each commit ? each night ?
2011-05-23T06:22:15  <RossPatterson> Each commit.  Sometimes TeamCity will bundle 2-3 commits together for a run - it's got an algorithm that tries to keep the job queue to a manageable size.
2011-05-23T06:22:24  <tcarpentier> "only use humans to do human-sized tasks, use machines to do boring or large tasks." I like your strategy!!
2011-05-23T06:22:39  <tcarpentier> ok
2011-05-23T06:26:40  <tcarpentier> Thanks for this discussion, it was very interesting ! Now  I have to show how I can incorporate selenium in our organization.I have to define an automation strategy, make some POC...

2011-05-23T08:05:06  <freynaud> from the experience I've had
2011-05-23T08:05:13  <freynaud> htmlunit is faster
2011-05-23T08:05:20  <oaror> with remotewebdriver?
2011-05-23T08:05:34  <freynaud> but as soon as you set JS to true, using firefox doesn't take more resources
2011-05-23T08:05:53  <freynaud> the only thing I noticed was firefox being slightly slower to start
2011-05-23T08:05:56  <freynaud> otherwise same
2011-05-23T08:07:04  <AutomatedTester> FirefoxDriver could be made faster if we didnt have to start it twice
2011-05-23T08:07:30  <AutomatedTester> but its easier to start it twice and get the profile perfect
2011-05-23T08:07:32  <oaror> In particular driver.get('....') took almost 40 seconds in this test for the htmlunit remotedriver
2011-05-23T08:07:42  <AutomatedTester> zomg

2011-05-23T08:09:56  <darren_> amitev, try something like this before you try to anything with an element on a css modal panel
2011-05-23T08:09:57  <darren_> ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("window.scrollTo(0, 99999)");
2011-05-23T08:09:59  *** miker2 has quit IRC
2011-05-23T08:10:32  <oaror> what can I do to identify what is taking so long in getting the url with driver.get('...')
2011-05-23T08:10:56  <amitev> darren_: i use arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true); now, but no luck
2011-05-23T08:11:13  <amitev> will try your way
2011-05-23T08:11:25  <AutomatedTester> oaror: setup wireshark and see would be my starting point
2011-05-23T08:11:50  <AutomatedTester> get() is a blocking call that waits for the browser to say its got everything
2011-05-23T08:12:00  <oaror> Ah I see.
2011-05-23T08:12:18  <oaror> so the HTML browser is simply taking that long to load the entire page
2011-05-23T08:12:26  <AutomatedTester> maybe htmlunit is emulating a download block that browsers no longer do
2011-05-23T08:12:26  <oaror> HTMLUNIT browser rather
2011-05-23T08:12:51  <oaror> Ok
2011-05-23T08:13:19  <AutomatedTester> like a normal browser may block other downloads if doing JavaScript to keep things secure
2011-05-23T08:13:33  <oaror> I will look into using wire shark - and also try some other urls to compare
2011-05-23T08:13:52  <AutomatedTester> i would start there
2011-05-23T08:14:02  <amitev> darren_: no luck

2011-05-23T08:14:30  <amitev> the strange is that i can see the link and when changing its color using javascript i can see it changed with my eyes

2011-05-23T08:41:41  <XCulver> if you want to select somethign with 2 different classes, do you recommend .FindElements(By.ClassName("class1")).FindElement(By.ClassName("class2")) or something else?
2011-05-23T08:42:18  <simonstewart> That would find the child of the first element
2011-05-23T08:42:36  <simonstewart> You need to iterate over the list returned by the first FindElements to find the one you want
2011-05-23T08:42:43  <XCulver> and why isn't .FindElement(s)(By.ClassName("class1 class2")) allowed?
2011-05-23T08:42:46  <XCulver> ok

2011-05-23T09:09:37  <dapidmini> when doing web testing with selenium do we need the website script or just any website will do? (without having the script)

2011-05-23T09:10:08  <dapidmini> oic
2011-05-23T09:10:13  <XCulver> selenium automates the browser

2011-05-23T09:11:11  <XCulver> its a short method

2011-05-23T09:12:26  <RossPatterson> XCulver: You seem to have invented LinqToSelenium :-)
2011-05-23T09:12:27  <dapidmini> i don't see any explanation about it in the seldocs
2011-05-23T09:12:33  <XCulver> haha
2011-05-23T09:12:42  <XCulver> RossPatterson:i found someone who had extended linq into it
2011-05-23T09:12:43  <simonstewart> dapidmini: basically, yes
2011-05-23T09:12:46  <XCulver> and added their extensions

2011-05-23T09:12:54  <simonstewart> NP
2011-05-23T09:13:00  <simonstewart> But notice "basically" :)

2011-05-23T09:13:46  <XCulver> RossPatterson: if you want i can give you the extension, its really small
2011-05-23T09:14:03  <XCulver> I dont remember where i got it though, i would love to give the credit where its due
2011-05-23T09:15:33  <RossPatterson> XCulver: Despite my distaste for Linq (I think it hides complexity so well that programmers often don't know how expensive an operation can become), that looks kind of reasonable to me.  Obviously it's going to scale according to the number of questions you have on the page, but that's kind of what you'd have to do (in WebDriver, anyway).
2011-05-23T09:16:04  *** nitin has quit IRC
2011-05-23T09:16:32  <RossPatterson> I'm sorely tempted to suggest using an XPath expression that includes all 3 criteria at once, but I don't think it would be dramatically faster (and of course, in IE, it would be slower).
2011-05-23T09:16:56  <XCulver> RossPatterson: ok, thats exactly what i was wondering
2011-05-23T09:17:10  <AutomatedTester> LINQ is the bomb
2011-05-23T09:17:19  <XCulver> the nested select is the one i was worried about
2011-05-23T09:17:39  <RossPatterson> I'm more of a Selenium RC guy, so the WebDriver API is less natural to me, but that looks like a proper use of it.
2011-05-23T09:18:39  <RossPatterson> Yup, hence my "scale according to the number of questions" comment.  For a huge number of questions, it'll be slower than you might want, but that's one of the Laws of Large Numbers: "Large numbers are large."
2011-05-23T09:18:53  <XCulver> RossPatterson: hehe, thanks for the input!
2011-05-23T09:20:52  <RossPatterson> LINQ (with the C# syntactic sugar) is OK, if you don't mind having beautiful code with difficult-to-predict performance.  What the designers seem to have forgotten is that SQL can be slow as well as pretty, and that Real Database Systems spend lots of energy on query optimization.
2011-05-23T09:21:03  <RossPatterson> Not that I'm opinionated or anything :-)
2011-05-23T09:22:21  <XCulver> RossPatterson: i've noticed the performance hitches in linq if i'm not careful
2011-05-23T09:23:06  <XCulver> especially when generating a list of webelement containers dynamically with a loop of some sort

2011-05-23T09:53:02  <dapidmini> what's the difference between ajax testing and regular website(html, css) testing?
2011-05-23T09:53:11  <simonstewart> Not much
2011-05-23T09:53:20  <simonstewart> Ultimately you're dealing with the browser's DOM
2011-05-23T09:53:46  <dapidmini> which is that? is it ajax or html testing that deals with DOM?
2011-05-23T09:54:05  <simonstewart> both
2011-05-23T09:54:09  <dapidmini> hmm
2011-05-23T09:54:25  <simonstewart> indeed.... What problem are you trying to solve?
2011-05-23T09:54:33  <dapidmini> so basically i can say that there's no difference between them?
2011-05-23T09:54:48  <simonstewart> An AJAX app is composed of HTML, CSS and Javascript
2011-05-23T09:54:49  <dapidmini> i want to do a webtesting for my final project
2011-05-23T09:55:03  <simonstewart> Ahhh... then a tool like selenium is a good choice
2011-05-23T09:55:15  <dapidmini> yes i agree
2011-05-23T09:55:19  <simonstewart> :)
2011-05-23T09:55:19  <dapidmini> that's why i'm here
2011-05-23T09:55:23  <dapidmini> :)
2011-05-23T09:55:30  <simonstewart> A static site and an ajax site have some pretty obvious difference
2011-05-23T09:55:33  <simonstewart> s
2011-05-23T09:55:56  <simonstewart> the main one being that you can't just parse the web server's response to figure out everything on a page
2011-05-23T09:56:06  <simonstewart> By definition, an AJAX site is not static :)
2011-05-23T09:56:13  <dapidmini> can you suggest a few websites that's big enough to be tested?
2011-05-23T09:56:27  <dapidmini> or some that's complex enough
2011-05-23T09:56:29  <simonstewart> http://www.google.co.uk/reader/play/
2011-05-23T09:56:34  <simonstewart> That's a fun one to automate
2011-05-23T09:57:44  <dapidmini> what's that website about?
2011-05-23T09:57:48  <dapidmini> is it a social network?
2011-05-23T09:58:15  <simonstewart> It's a front end for Google Reader
2011-05-23T09:58:35  <dapidmini> so it's like a new website?
2011-05-23T09:58:55  <simonstewart> It's been around for a while
2011-05-23T09:59:09  <simonstewart> A year or so

2011-05-23T09:59:14  <dapidmini> i mean news website
2011-05-23T10:00:48  <simonstewart> Oh. Yeah. Sort of
2011-05-23T10:00:53  <simonstewart> RSS feed aggregation
2011-05-23T10:02:24  <quentusrex> Is there a way to do a selector on a div, then select an element inside of it? such as: 'css=div[class="thing"]a[class="create"]' ???
2011-05-23T10:03:34  <XCulver> By.Css("csshere")
2011-05-23T10:03:47  <XCulver> or By.Xpath("xpathhere")
2011-05-23T10:05:32  <quentusrex> XCulver, I'm asking specifically how to chain selectors
2011-05-23T10:05:49  <quentusrex> Also, is there a way to do a css selector and specify with a regex?
2011-05-23T10:06:39  <RossPatterson> quentusrex: Sounds like you're using the Selenium RC API.  Try 'css=div[class="thing"] a[class="create"]' (Note the space between 'thing"]' and 'a[class]).
2011-05-23T10:07:04  <RossPatterson> Ref: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#descendant-selectors
2011-05-23T10:08:47  <quentusrex> 'css=div[class="thing"] * a[class="create"]' correct?

2011-05-23T10:22:33  <RossPatterson> quentusrex: That depends on whether the DIV contains elements that contain the A or not.  "*" matches at least one element, not zero-or-more as in regexes.
2011-05-23T10:23:05  <RossPatterson> Sorry, I meant "* matches exactly one element"
2011-05-23T10:23:05  <quentusrex> Thanks RossPatterson that helped me solve the issue.
2011-05-23T10:23:31  <RossPatterson> CSS and regular expressions don't have much in common with each other.

2011-05-23T10:37:02  <simonstewart> Hi Eran
2011-05-23T10:37:06  <simonstewart> How's the release going?
2011-05-23T10:37:13  <simonstewart> What are the blockers?
2011-05-23T10:37:49  <eranm> There's been some progress since the last update to the developers mailing list.
2011-05-23T10:37:55  <simonstewart> good news
2011-05-23T10:38:07  <simonstewart> Did you see that AutomatedTester started landing Firefox 5 support?
2011-05-23T10:38:36  <eranm> The issue with native events on Firefox 4 is close to being solved - track issue 1661
2011-05-23T10:38:51  <simonstewart> Yay!
2011-05-23T10:39:38  <eranm> There are no documents for the new Grid yet - Francois is on it, Dave Hunt volunteered to help
2011-05-23T10:39:55  <simonstewart> Sweet. How about releasing the maven artifacts?
2011-05-23T10:39:58  *** barancev has joined #selenium
2011-05-23T10:40:07  <simonstewart> And are we also pushing the C#, ruby and python bindings at the same time?
2011-05-23T10:40:12  <simonstewart> How are the tests looking?
2011-05-23T10:41:05  <freynaud> eranm:  is the doc for grid a blocker for release ?
2011-05-23T10:41:18  <eranm> The only failing test (Selenium RC on Firefox 4) was also fixed, it was a matter of waiting for the condition
2011-05-23T10:41:25  <simonstewart> Since Grid is one of the main features of this release, it'd be good to have them available
2011-05-23T10:41:35  <simonstewart> Sweet
2011-05-23T10:41:39  <freynaud> k
2011-05-23T10:41:52  <eranm> simonstewart: do you consider the docs a blocker or not?
2011-05-23T10:42:10  <simonstewart> I'd hope that there was something ready
2011-05-23T10:42:20  <barancev> simonstewart: eranm: have you found why alerts don't work in FF4 with Selenium RC?
2011-05-23T10:42:27  <simonstewart> It is, I repeat, a major feature of this release and something that people will really want to try
2011-05-23T10:42:40  <simonstewart> At least document the command line switches
2011-05-23T10:42:56  <simonstewart> And make sure that the "selenium-server-standalone.jar" we ship contains grid
2011-05-23T10:42:58  <freynaud> ok, i know what I'll do tonight then
2011-05-23T10:43:06  *** _danny has quit IRC
2011-05-23T10:43:11  <barancev> I ran tests today, and they still hang on alerts
2011-05-23T10:43:24  <simonstewart> Firefox 4, Win7?
2011-05-23T10:43:34  <barancev> yes, FF4, Win7
2011-05-23T10:44:29  <simonstewart> Dinner time for me
2011-05-23T10:44:32  <simonstewart> biab
2011-05-23T10:44:34  <eranm> I suggest checking that again after the native events issue is fixed, barancev
2011-05-23T10:44:50  <simonstewart> eranm: this is with RC
2011-05-23T10:44:54  <simonstewart> Native events shouldn't matter
2011-05-23T10:44:55  <eranm> Ahh
2011-05-23T10:45:04  <barancev> eranm: yes, this is 1.0 API
2011-05-23T10:45:09  <eranm> I'll try that agin
2011-05-23T10:45:10  <eranm> again
2011-05-23T10:45:21  <eranm> The RC tests passed on Linux with Firefox 4
2011-05-23T10:45:54  <barancev> Simon has reproduced the problem on its Win7 box
2011-05-23T10:48:10  <AutomatedTester> the Fx4,Fx5 and Fx6 passed on Mac today
2011-05-23T10:48:13  <AutomatedTester> for Se1
2011-05-23T10:50:16  * AutomatedTester needs a new Windows VM
2011-05-23T10:50:56  <eranm> I'm away from my Win7 machine, but I'll start testing it with a Windows VM
2011-05-23T10:53:48  <eranm> Windows XP, that is
2011-05-23T10:54:39  *** johnnywengluu has joined #selenium
2011-05-23T10:56:45  <DarkRift> when is the next release expected ?
2011-05-23T11:00:20  <eranm> DarkRift: as soon as native events are working on Firefox 4
2011-05-23T11:00:37  <DarkRift> ok
2011-05-23T11:00:42  <eranm> We could also do with help on the documentation, if you want to get involved
2011-05-23T11:01:05  <eranm> AutomatedTester: will you be available to help with releasing the python bindings at the same time I release RC1?
2011-05-23T11:01:18  <DarkRift> yeah I could do that
2011-05-23T11:01:21  <AutomatedTester> eranm: we good to go
2011-05-23T11:01:31  <eranm> cool
2011-05-23T11:01:46  * AutomatedTester is currently looking at Fx5 support as well
2011-05-23T11:01:49  <eranm> DarkRift: freynaud is the person to talk to, then
2011-05-23T11:01:56  <AutomatedTester> I might sneak it in if there is time
2011-05-23T11:02:07  <eranm> that'd be cool
2011-05-23T11:02:23  <AutomatedTester> Se1 Fx5 and Fx6 support went in today
2011-05-23T11:02:32  <AutomatedTester> webdriver is a different beast
2011-05-23T11:02:39  <AutomatedTester> but been doing other things
2011-05-23T11:02:54  <AutomatedTester> have the files open ready to start hunting
2011-05-23T11:04:26  <eranm> Have I told you I figured out the issue with native events?
2011-05-23T11:10:46  <simonstewart> eranm: the firefox 4 RC problem is definitely reproducible on Win7
2011-05-23T11:14:46  <eranm> simonstewart: can you paste a log of the failure somewhere? I want to see if it's the same as I've fixed on Selenium RC / Firefox 4 / Linux
2011-05-23T11:15:09  <simonstewart> There's no log: the alert opens and hangs the browser
2011-05-23T11:15:23  <simonstewart> So it looks like we're not overloading window.alert properly
2011-05-23T11:15:33  <eranm> Ah. Hmm.
2011-05-23T11:15:34  <simonstewart> Which implies that the demon inner window problem has come back
2011-05-23T11:15:48  <eranm> Is it documented in any issue?
2011-05-23T11:15:58  <simonstewart> Other than the build? I don't think so
2011-05-23T11:16:12  <eranm> I mean, the 'inner window problem'
2011-05-23T11:16:20  <simonstewart> That? Nope.
2011-05-23T11:16:26  <simonstewart> We talk about it a lot on the IRC channel
2011-05-23T11:16:33  <simonstewart> And AutomatedTester knows about it

2011-05-23T11:22:14  <eranm> simonstewart: so who do you suggest is the best person to look at this problem? I could only have a look at it after I'm done with the native events
2011-05-23T11:22:42  <simonstewart> There's an IRC channel full of people willing to help

2011-05-23T11:44:35  <__mike> hi all. i wrote native code for iedriver.dll which keeps scrolling a page to take pictures of rectangles of the client area then stitches it together to make a big picture. so ends up taking a screenshot of the whole page. is this useful to contribute back ?
2011-05-23T11:45:40  <simonstewart> The next release of the IE driver should be taking entire page screenshots
2011-05-23T11:45:46  <simonstewart> He says
2011-05-23T11:45:49  <simonstewart> Confidently
2011-05-23T11:46:02  <AutomatedTester> if you say it confidently it must be true
2011-05-23T11:46:47  <__mike> oh ? how does that one work out of interest ? i saw the current method is printwindow on the client area. i'm doing the same thing but scrolling then stitching the parts
2011-05-23T11:47:00  *** esteele has joined #selenium
2011-05-23T11:47:00  <simonstewart> it scales the window past the bounds of the desktop
2011-05-23T11:47:19  <__mike> ah that makes sense. how is it able to determine how big to scale the page ?
2011-05-23T11:47:44  <simonstewart> I'm not sure
2011-05-23T11:47:48  <simonstewart> I can read the code
2011-05-23T11:48:00  <__mike> however there is a difference doing this. for example i used this method so i can see what the page looks like on a given screensize. eg. if displayed in a phone. stretching the page will cause a different effect for some pages
2011-05-23T11:48:17  <__mike> it's not in trunk is it ? i just checked out today and didn't see this
2011-05-23T11:48:22  <simonstewart> I'd need to read the code to figure out if it maintains the width
2011-05-23T11:48:27  <simonstewart> It's in trunk
2011-05-23T11:48:31  <__mike> oo
2011-05-23T11:48:36  <__mike> let me check that out
2011-05-23T11:48:52  <__mike> also do you know anything about screenshotting on chrome ? at the moment i implemented that myself also. but only on windows for time being
2011-05-23T11:49:05  <simonstewart> There's an open issue for this on the chrome tracker
2011-05-23T11:49:33  <__mike> okie dokes
2011-05-23T11:50:03  <__mike> btw i made a post in selenium-users yesterday about grid 2 and a bug i think i may have encountered. do you know if that post is still under moderation or did i just screw up posting it and you guys never got it ?
2011-05-23T11:50:37  <simonstewart> It should have been posted. There's no pending posts

2011-05-23T11:50:58  <freynaud> __mike: what's the problem ?
2011-05-23T11:51:01  <simonstewart> I'm not an admin
2011-05-23T11:51:11  <simonstewart> But freynaud is The Man for Grid, and here he is
2011-05-23T11:51:19  <__mike> it failed with IE9 on my system
2011-05-23T11:51:28  <__mike> but worked fine with IE8 on another system
2011-05-23T11:51:36  <__mike> it works with chrome and firefox however
2011-05-23T11:51:44  <__mike> it is very nice...
2011-05-23T11:52:21  <freynaud> does it work it you use your system without the grid at all ?
2011-05-23T11:52:27  *** ben_ has joined #selenium
2011-05-23T11:52:29  <__mike> yes it does, works fine without grid
2011-05-23T11:52:34  <freynaud> browser specific issues are usually not grid related
2011-05-23T11:52:47  <freynaud> using remoteWebDriver
2011-05-23T11:52:49  <freynaud> ?
2011-05-23T11:52:51  <__mike> yep
2011-05-23T11:53:02  <__mike> not sure if it's related but i was making the node and the hub localhost
2011-05-23T11:53:07  <__mike> but worked for chrome + firefox
2011-05-23T11:53:17  <freynaud> do you have a test showing the problem ?
2011-05-23T11:53:26  <freynaud> localhost makes it easy to reproduce :)

2011-05-23T11:54:30  <__mike> just gonna quickly compile current trunk
2011-05-23T11:54:44  <freynaud> can you file a bug and attach your test ? something like https://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/java/server/test/org/openqa/grid/e2e/misc/Issue1586.java
2011-05-23T11:55:31  <__mike> i'm actually using command line to start the hub and the node. is that okay ?
2011-05-23T11:56:10  <jarib> __mike, simonstewart: the chromedriver in trunk does support full screen screenshots
2011-05-23T11:56:20  <simonstewart> Nope
2011-05-23T11:56:32  <simonstewart> The bug is filed against the new chrome driver
2011-05-23T11:56:43  <__mike> well when using it on the grid. if i augment the remotewebdriver it fails when casting to takesscreenshot
2011-05-23T11:56:47  <__mike> whereas firefox and IE do cast
2011-05-23T11:56:53  <__mike> i don't know how else i'd take a screenshot
2011-05-23T11:57:36  <jarib> simonstewart: huh? i just took a screenshot with the new driver here
2011-05-23T11:57:53  <freynaud> __mike: put what you have in the bug
2011-05-23T11:58:00  <freynaud> I'll ping you if I can't reproduce

2011-05-23T12:04:41  <__mike> i had to do a similar thing but i think i did it a dumb way. i did getPageSource() then hooked the return up to jsoup. i'm sure there's a smarter way though. brb

2011-05-23T14:23:46  <__mike> hi freynaud i have just reproduced the bug..
2011-05-23T14:24:02  <__mike> let me raise an issue
2011-05-23T14:24:05  <freynaud> k
2011-05-23T14:28:27  <__mike> okay freynaud : http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1699
2011-05-23T14:29:32  <freynaud> have you tried with RemoteDriver ?
2011-05-23T14:29:48  <__mike> i did not even know there is a remotedriver class
2011-05-23T14:30:18  <__mike> if you mean remotewebdriver, it is using that
2011-05-23T14:30:22  *** joff has joined #selenium
2011-05-23T14:30:35  <freynaud> when you do WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver( new URL("http://localhost:4444/grid/driver"),
2011-05-23T14:30:45  <__mike> yep
2011-05-23T14:30:50  <freynaud> that's a RemoteWebDriver
2011-05-23T14:30:59  <freynaud> you can use that without using grid at all
2011-05-23T14:31:17  <freynaud> if you target a webdriver instead
2011-05-23T14:31:24  <freynaud> WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver( new URL("http://localhost:4444/wb/hub"),
2011-05-23T14:31:25  <__mike> oh yes
2011-05-23T14:31:27  <__mike> okay let me try that
2011-05-23T14:31:31  <__mike> sorry i see what you mean

2011-05-23T14:31:46  <freynaud> grid goes in between, it could had some crap, but it's not supposed to :)
2011-05-23T14:32:00  *** DarkRift has joined #selenium
2011-05-23T14:32:16  <freynaud> hum
2011-05-23T14:32:27  <freynaud> it's a grid problem
2011-05-23T14:32:40  <__mike> what should the registration url be when just running without a grid ?
2011-05-23T14:32:48  <freynaud> the matcher has a problem
2011-05-23T14:32:51  <__mike> okay
2011-05-23T14:33:50  <freynaud> i suspect it' s more something around the platform
2011-05-23T14:33:54  <freynaud> more than the IE version
2011-05-23T14:34:20  <__mike> well
2011-05-23T14:34:26  <__mike> i have tested grid on my other computer
2011-05-23T14:34:31  <__mike> which runs xp
2011-05-23T14:34:32  <__mike> and ie8
2011-05-23T14:34:34  <__mike> and it works okay there
2011-05-23T14:35:13  <freynaud> and both run XP ?
2011-05-23T14:35:29  <__mike> the IE9 machine which is the one it is not working on is running windows 7
2011-05-23T14:35:53  <freynaud> k
2011-05-23T14:36:18  <__mike> also i think there is a bug with the IE screenshot. it displays this http://localhostr.com/file/C87LfQU/screenshot1819576484937299214.png
2011-05-23T14:37:15  <__mike> i had this problem on my other pc too. i think it maybe that the printwindow is called too quickly after resizing. maybe the window needs time to draw ? you can probably get round it by invalidating the client area and forcing a redraw though waiting is fine
2011-05-23T14:37:32  <freynaud> Can you try DesiredCapabilities ie = new DesiredCapabilities();
2011-05-23T14:37:32  <freynaud> 		ie.setBrowserName("internet explorer");
2011-05-23T14:37:44  <__mike> yep hold on
2011-05-23T14:37:50  <freynaud> instead of DesiredCapabilities.internetExplorer();
2011-05-23T14:40:07  <__mike> yes that works
2011-05-23T14:41:56  <freynaud> the default SelfRegistering isn't great for IE and windows
2011-05-23T14:42:23  <freynaud> when you use the selfRegistering and the default, then look at the hub localhost:4444/grid/console
2011-05-23T14:42:29  <freynaud> mouse over the IE icon
2011-05-23T14:42:37  <freynaud> you can see what the hub knows
2011-05-23T14:42:43  <freynaud> it doesn't have the version
2011-05-23T14:43:06  <freynaud> and i suspect the platform won't be super accurate either
2011-05-23T14:44:00  <__mike> detects platform as vista and no detected version
2011-05-23T14:44:27  <freynaud> that's the "expected" behavior
2011-05-23T14:44:44  <__mike> why is it detecting platform wrong ? it is fairly easy to get that accurately natively on windows
2011-05-23T14:45:11  <freynaud> System.getProperty("os.name")
2011-05-23T14:45:30  <__mike> ah
2011-05-23T14:45:55  <__mike> no
2011-05-23T14:45:57  <__mike> that can't be right
2011-05-23T14:46:05  <__mike> System.out.println( System.getProperty("os.name") ); produces windows 7
2011-05-23T14:47:12  <freynaud> https://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/Platform.java
2011-05-23T14:47:29  <__mike> ; )
2011-05-23T14:47:36  <freynaud> i use getCurrent in the selfRegistering node code
2011-05-23T14:51:13  <__mike> btw someone said earlier that chromedriver can take screenshot. however it does not implement takesscreenshot, only extends remotewebdriver. casting will throw a casting error

2011-05-23T15:02:35  <freynaud> __mike: so the vista part will require modification to platform
2011-05-23T15:03:06  <freynaud> bit for the version at least, you can just specify it yourself . I don't think there is another wat
2011-05-23T15:03:08  <freynaud> way
2011-05-23T15:03:24  <freynaud> when you register your node, instead of using the default, use
2011-05-23T15:03:30  <__mike> cool i'm actually gonna sleep soon. but if you want anything else tested let me know
2011-05-23T15:03:57  <__mike> okay cool. i'll add a comment for that workaround
2011-05-23T15:04:05  <freynaud> -role webdriver -port 5555 -hub xxx -browser "browserName=internet explorer,version=6"
2011-05-23T15:04:21  <__mike> i'm actually going to be doing quite a bit of work with grid in next few days so i'll let you know if i find any more bugs
2011-05-23T15:04:34  <freynaud> sure.

2011-05-23T15:47:46  <jarib> (briefly)
2011-05-23T15:48:02  <amitev> remember my question today about an element that is not visible when running test under standalone server
2011-05-23T15:48:13  <amitev> you asked if there could be a timing issue
2011-05-23T15:48:14  <jarib> yep
2011-05-23T15:48:30  <amitev> i'm "waiting" for the element to be presented
2011-05-23T15:48:47  <jarib> ok
2011-05-23T15:48:48  <amitev> exaclty the same code
2011-05-23T15:48:54  <amitev> exactly the same browser
2011-05-23T15:49:02  <amitev> i even run the standalone server on my local machine
2011-05-23T15:49:10  <jarib> and it times out when using the remote
2011-05-23T15:49:19  <amitev> no
2011-05-23T15:49:22  <amitev> it doesn't
2011-05-23T15:49:32  <jarib> no?
2011-05-23T15:49:36  <amitev> it yields that the element is not visible and cannot be manipulated
2011-05-23T15:49:50  <jarib> so you're not waiting for the element to become visible
2011-05-23T15:50:10  <amitev> if i wait it to become visible it never happens and times out
2011-05-23T15:51:20  <jarib> you just told me it didn't time out

2011-05-23T15:54:24  <jarib> i'm at a loss for how this could happen unless your server wasn't built from the same version as your bindings
2011-05-23T15:54:46  <jarib> since we end up running the same code in the browser in both cases
2011-05-23T15:55:15  <amitev> all jars are 2.0b3 version

2011-05-23T15:57:03  <jarib> i'd try building both server and client from trunk, and if that doesn't help, try to create a small test case that will let others reproduce the problem

2011-05-23T16:36:42  <eranm> Does anybody know if you can provide a JVM system property through rake? (specifically, webdriver.firefox.bin)
2011-05-23T16:37:26  <jarib> hmm
2011-05-23T16:37:45  *** ivog has joined #selenium
2011-05-23T16:39:55  <jarib> eranm: i think you'd have to either (a) edit go{,.bat} or (b) edit the Rakefile and do System.setProperty(...) or ENV_JAVA['webdriver.firefox.bin'] = '/the/path'
2011-05-23T16:40:13  <eranm> That'll do
2011-05-23T16:40:46  <eranm> is ENV_JAVA picked up by Rake automatically?
2011-05-23T16:41:19  <jarib> ENV_JAVA is just a shortcut for System.setProperty/getProperty in JRuby
2011-05-23T16:42:13  <jarib> if the target shells out to another JVM, i'm not sure if it'll be propagated
2011-05-23T16:42:25  <jarib> but i don't think we do that too often
