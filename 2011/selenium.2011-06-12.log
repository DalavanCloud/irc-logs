2011-06-12T13:18:04  *** red^ is now known as reddeviL
2011-06-12T13:18:30  <simonstewart> the selenium-api.js file is packed in the jar
2011-06-12T13:27:13  <Mayank> simonstewart: any leads on how to edit it? if I extract the jar?
2011-06-12T13:27:15  <rstrazhnyk1> hi! Maybe someone could answer the question. Python bindings for webdriver does not support selenium1 emulation yet, i mean driverbackedselenium and back. So it would be included soon or not, or never?
2011-06-12T13:27:35  <simonstewart> Why not just use the "jar" command?
2011-06-12T13:27:43  <simonstewart> Or "zip" even
2011-06-12T13:27:50  <simonstewart> A jar file is just a renamed zip after all
2011-06-12T13:28:57  <Mayank> well yeah! but how do I pack them back in the jar? <may be I should Google that!>
2011-06-12T13:29:16  <simonstewart> :)
2011-06-12T13:29:24  <simonstewart> You can unpack the JAR entirely using zip
2011-06-12T13:29:29  <rstrazhnyk1> I am doing one project and can't decide, can I switch to driver or stick with good old selenium 1.0 and be aware of problems/compatibility?
2011-06-12T13:29:31  <simonstewart> and then zip everything back up
2011-06-12T13:29:53  <simonstewart> For a new project, I'd always pick the webdriver APIs
2011-06-12T13:30:13  <Mayank> simonstewart: Thanks!

2011-06-12T13:32:27  <Mayank> I am still a begginner, but and I am not very sure if this is implementable - but - It would be great if Selenium could record onLoad alets!
2011-06-12T13:33:02  <Mayank> s/alets/alerts
2011-06-12T13:33:27  <simonstewart> The way that selenium 1 is architected means that it can't record them
2011-06-12T13:33:28  <rstrazhnyk1> simonstewart: thanks, i will also try

2011-06-12T13:34:42  <simonstewart> Nothing can
2011-06-12T13:35:02  <simonstewart> But the webdriver apis allow you to handle them when playing back
2011-06-12T13:35:56  <Mayank> I will have to use - HTML table format. , so trying to remove the code that returns the error.
2011-06-12T13:36:11  <Mayank> window.alert=null; does not work too!
2011-06-12T13:37:37  *** miker2 has joined #selenium
2011-06-12T13:38:51  <simonstewart> no, it won't
2011-06-12T13:39:14  <simonstewart> Your code to replace "window.alert" executes after the load event has fired
2011-06-12T13:39:33  <simonstewart> Which means it's too late to avoid having the alert open
2011-06-12T13:41:08  <Mayank> Yeah, actually the code does supress the alert visilbly but Selenium detects it. So if I remove the alert detection, and use window.alert = null; That should work I guess.
2011-06-12T13:46:00  <Mayank> that is what i learnt from AutoMated Tester
2011-06-12T13:46:15  <simonstewart> I'd be surprised if it does
2011-06-12T13:46:21  <simonstewart> But I get surprised from time to time

2011-06-12T14:13:56  <cgoldberg> anyone know how how to use the HtmlUnit driver for WebDriver (from Python)?  I have the latest Python bindings and don't see anything related to HtmlUnit listed in dir(webdriver).
2011-06-12T14:15:09  <simonstewart> You need to use the remote webdriver

2011-06-12T20:58:40  <watsonmw> Hi, anyone recognise the following error when starting python-webdriver "free_socket.bind((socket.gethostname(), 0)) socket.error: [Errno 49] Can't assign requested address"?
2011-06-12T21:00:49  <watsonmw> changing the python binding to do a socket.bind(("localhost", 0)) instead of bind((socket.gethostname(), 0)) fixes it

2011-06-12T21:28:40  <ner0x> Everything seems to work on my version of selenium, unfortunately, it does not close the firefox window it opened.
2011-06-12T21:30:50  <ner0x> Is there a command to close the browser?
2011-06-12T21:31:49  <watsonmw> dirver.close()
2011-06-12T21:31:49  <watsonmw> or driver.quit()
