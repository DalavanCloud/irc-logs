I suspect some of my tests take more time then the predefined timeout of 30 seconds but im not sure... It looks like logging and setting timeout isn't implemebted yet. Any idea when these settings will be configurable? Or could i have a different problem?

2011-04-13T04:24:10  <freynaud> Ivog: about the timout
2011-04-13T04:24:29  <freynaud> you're having tests not sending any selenium commands for more that 30 sec ?
2011-04-13T04:25:58  <Ivog> Ya
2011-04-13T04:25:58  <Ivog> No
2011-04-13T04:26:04  <Ivog> They're not idle just lenghty
2011-04-13T04:26:18  <freynaud> the timeout shouldn't impact them then
2011-04-13T04:26:43  <freynaud> the timeout is only triggers when a tests doesn't receive any command
2011-04-13T04:26:52  <Ivog> Ok i thought so. Then there's something else going on
2011-04-13T04:27:01  <freynaud> if you're checking a page title in a loop for 2 days, it won't time out
2011-04-13T04:30:11  <Ivog> Ok, i think logging would help to resolve these problems, do u have plans for supporting logfiles or can i maybe help in that area?
2011-04-13T04:34:00  <freynaud> there is nothing grid specific for the logging
2011-04-13T04:34:12  <freynaud> it's using the same as the rest of the selenium project
2011-04-13T04:35:33  <Ivog> It looks like -log <logfilename> is not supported yet or am i overlooking something?
2011-04-13T04:36:27  <freynaud> i'll have to check before answering
2011-04-13T04:36:47  <freynaud> when it crashes, can  you see the nodes ?

2011-04-13T04:44:01  <Davbo> Hi all, I'm running Selenium with a few extensions which really don't need to run on the RC window (the one showing command history etc). Is it possible to specify a separate FF Profile for this window?

2011-04-13T07:53:55  <rycrostud> So I have to export as PHP and edit every test?
2011-04-13T07:55:54  <RossPatterson> Pretty much.  The IDE command languange is kinda limited, and more interesting stuff requires RC and coding.
2011-04-13T07:56:37  <rycrostud> That's a shame. I was hopnig our HMTL coders could build the functionality tests for the front-end stuff they are doing and that would be that.  Hmmmm....
2011-04-13T07:57:28  <rycrostud> The "Failed asserting that <boolean:true> is false." messages aren't very useful :-(
2011-04-13T07:58:53  <rycrostud> I wonder if I could write my own PHP format plugin that took the 'Value' from IDE and used that as the message.
2011-04-13T07:59:59  <RossPatterson> Perhaps ... the information *is* available to the formatting plugins.  And you'll find that the code for them isn't particularly difficult to work with.
2011-04-13T08:00:31  <rycrostud> Cool.  I like a challenge :-)  Thanks for you help!
2011-04-13T08:01:59  <RossPatterson> Check out the PHP fomatting code at /ide/plugins/php-format/src/content/formats
2011-04-13T08:03:19  <RossPatterson> It contains stuff like this:
2011-04-13T08:03:19  <RossPatterson> function assertTrue(expression) {
2011-04-13T08:03:19  <RossPatterson> return "$this->assertTrue(" + expression.toString() + ");";
2011-04-13T08:03:19  <RossPatterson> }
2011-04-13T08:04:10  <rycrostud> Ah ha!
2011-04-13T08:05:06  <RossPatterson> In recent versions of IDE, the formatters are built as plugins, specifically to allow you to replace them with modified versions.

2011-04-13T09:08:45  <ivog> hi, i'd like some help building the tests-standalone.jar, what target should i use to build it?
2011-04-13T09:09:40  *** christophermcmah has joined #selenium
2011-04-13T09:10:50  <christophermcmah> hoping someone can give me a clue.  I am scraping a very simple raw-XML page.  the Se xpath locators work fine in FF but fail in IE.  any suggestions?
2011-04-13T09:11:27  <ivog> what's the error?
2011-04-13T09:11:56  <christophermcmah> no error at all, it simply times out and never finds the element it's looking for
2011-04-13T09:12:51  <ivog> what language are you using and what version of selenium?
2011-04-13T09:14:11  <christophermcmah> this is Java, Se-RC 1.0.3, Windows, IE8
2011-04-13T09:15:24  <ivog> are you able to upgrade to selenium 2?
2011-04-13T09:15:51  <christophermcmah> possibly, I can look into it
2011-04-13T09:16:43  <christophermcmah> the funny thing is that I've done this before in a completely different environment and had no problems at all
2011-04-13T09:16:54  <ivog> it would be great it u could give it a go with selenium 2b3 im not really sure but i think the internetexplorer driver is updated
2011-04-13T09:17:12  <ivog> with ie8 also?
2011-04-13T09:17:56  <christophermcmah> yeah, I had a similar scrape-raw-xpath setup at a different job a while back, with much more complex XML, and had no problems.  this XML is dead simple.
2011-04-13T09:18:09  <jimevans> The IE driver hasn't really changed much for RC. It's the WebDriver API that changed.
2011-04-13T09:19:47  <jimevans> christophermcmah: Tell me a little more about your project. It sounds like you're pointing your browser to a raw XML file served up by an HTTP server.
2011-04-13T09:20:17  <christophermcmah>  yes
2011-04-13T09:21:00  <christophermcmah> I have a REST endpoint that exposes some system data for my tests to use.  I hit a URL in the browser and use xpath locators and getText to load a variable
2011-04-13T09:22:10  *** erwan has quit IRC
2011-04-13T09:23:45  <jimevans> Why would you use Selenium for that? If it were me, I'd use the WebClient to download the XML file and use the Java XML APIs to parse it into a DOM.

2011-04-13T09:25:43  <jimevans> Selenium's a great hammer, but that problem doesn't sound like a nail to me.
2011-04-13T09:25:48  <jimevans> ivog: yes.
2011-04-13T09:27:06  <ivog> i'm trying to run the remote unit tests, first a testwebserver is being started, but that doesn't work here because the  required tests-standalone.jar doesn't exist on my system, im trying to figure out how to build it
2011-04-13T09:27:46  <christophermcmah> actually, I take it all back.  seems to be an IE8 issue at heart

2011-04-13T09:28:53  <ivog> im building on win7 64, just running go.bat eventually gets aborted because of firefox tests failing, i'm trying to find the right target to be able to build that jar
2011-04-13T09:29:05  <jimevans> ivog: from the Visual Studio commmand prompt at the root of your source tree, do "go //dotnet/common-test"
2011-04-13T09:29:47  <jimevans> you can build the jar with "go //java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium:test:uber"
2011-04-13T09:30:00  <jimevans> sorry, its "go //java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium:tests:uber"
2011-04-13T09:30:48  *** towski has joined #selenium
2011-04-13T09:31:02  <ivog> yes! that's it thanks :)
2011-04-13T09:31:02  <jimevans> however, even if the standard "go" command is aborted during the tests, the jar should have been built.
2011-04-13T09:31:56  <ivog> reason i ask is because i want to write a test pointing out that there's somehting wrong with an exception coming from a remotewebdriver through grid
2011-04-13T09:32:50  <jimevans> ok
2011-04-13T09:33:58  <ivog> i have a test using .net bindings which i run through grid, then a nosuchelementexception occurs on the rc, but it then looks like the rawstacktrace can't be parsed because of a NPE on StackTraceElement:48
2011-04-13T09:35:19  *** erwan has joined #selenium
2011-04-13T09:35:36  <ivog> so i'm thinking of writing an e2e test which points that out, does that sound reasonable?
2011-04-13T09:37:45  <jimevans> i suppose. where exactly does the error manifest itself? in the console of the server? in your test case?
2011-04-13T09:38:09  *** XCulver has joined #selenium

2011-04-13T09:39:18  <XCulver> whats the xpath for that?
2011-04-13T09:39:19  <ivog> in the rc i see the problem occuring, it then looks like it packages the trace to be able to send it to the client, the client unpacks the error in RemoteWebDriver.UnpackAndThrowOnError and the error occurs during unpacking the stacktrace
2011-04-13T09:39:19  <XCulver> or css?
2011-04-13T09:39:29  *** santiycr has joined #selenium
2011-04-13T09:40:13  <jimevans> ivog: ok so it's a language binding problem then. fair enough.
2011-04-13T09:40:35  <jimevans> your use of "NPE" through me.
2011-04-13T09:40:53  <ivog> i mean nullreferenceexception
2011-04-13T09:41:31  <ivog> it could also be a problem with the packaging of the error in the rc, or the tunneling through grid, i don't know
2011-04-13T09:41:58  <jimevans> what must be happening is that the stack trace packaged by the server is returning null for the fileName attribute.
2011-04-13T09:42:11  <jimevans> (if the failure is in StackTraceElement, line 48).
2011-04-13T09:42:28  <jimevans> simple fix, really.
2011-04-13T09:44:51  <ivog> yea but it seems to me like it shouldn't be null right?
2011-04-13T09:44:59  <jimevans> change line 46 of StackTraceElement.cs to read: if (elementAttributes.ContainsKey("fileName") && elementAttributes["fileName"] != null)
2011-04-13T09:46:25  *** santiycr has quit IRC
2011-04-13T09:46:52  <jimevans> ivog: maybe it shouldn't be null, but this will get you past the problem

2011-04-13T11:02:06  <MikeGrace> Could anyone point me in the right direction or is there no good documentation yet?
2011-04-13T11:02:10  <nirvdrum> jimevans: Who has a page that absurdly large? :-P
2011-04-13T11:02:51  <nirvdrum> Dunno.  I'd have to look more.  I thought it was a LONGPTR, but perhaps not.
2011-04-13T11:03:03  <jimevans> nirvdrum: :) if you open macbeth.html from the test website, it clocks in as something like 85000 pixels in height.
2011-04-13T11:03:19  <jimevans> docs say height is a long.
2011-04-13T11:03:42  <nirvdrum> jimevans: Fair enough.  I've personally tested 10s of thousands of sites, many gnarly, and haven't run into that problem.

2011-04-13T11:06:19  <jimevans> RossPatterson: the nice thing about StackExchange is the ability to filter on specific tags.
2011-04-13T11:06:24  <RossPatterson> Jim's right, and AT's mentioned before that the next drop of the bindings to PyPi (whatever that is) will have docs.
2011-04-13T11:06:41  <jimevans> and it forces you to tag questions.
2011-04-13T11:07:01  <RossPatterson> Yup, I'm a StackOverflow fan, I believe in the concept.  But it won't increase the s/n ratio over selenium-users.

2011-04-13T11:09:26  <RossPatterson> My comparison point is the existing "selenium" and "selenium rc" tags on SO.  The questions are mostly junk.  So I can't imagine an Se-focused StackExchange site will be any different.
