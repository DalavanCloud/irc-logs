2011-04-18T02:08:05  <jarib> hehe

2011-04-18T02:54:04  <jarib> AutomatedTester: ok? looked quite sane to me
2011-04-18T02:54:41  <jarib> except ActionChains(self.driver) could become driver.action()
2011-04-18T02:55:30  <jarib> and there should just be a single perform() call for a bunch of actions
2011-04-18T02:55:36  <jarib> not sure if that's already supported
2011-04-18T02:59:13  <AutomatedTester> jarib: it looks very good, dont get me wrong
2011-04-18T02:59:45  <AutomatedTester> i was looking to have the separate keyboard and mouse classes
2011-04-18T03:00:06  <AutomatedTester> the action chains would then just call into those

2011-04-18T03:17:01  <jarib> AutomatedTester: you could apply it and then refactor

2011-04-18T03:36:38  <jarib> and if that was ever a goal of theirs, they haven't communicated it very clearly

2011-04-18T05:50:52  <AutomatedTester> well, lemme rephrase

2011-04-18T05:51:19  <AutomatedTester> and as a user, thats what I would expect
2011-04-18T05:51:39  <jimevans> ok, in ie's implementation of element.focus() puts it at the beginning of the content.

2011-04-18T07:03:00  <ato> How does the IEDriver work exactly?  What's the method it uses for automating IE called again?
2011-04-18T07:03:59  <jimevans> the IE driver uses the IE COM interfaces
2011-04-18T07:06:30  <jimevans> the ie driver spins up an HTTP server (mongoose) which the language bindings use to communicate via the json wire protocol.
2011-04-18T07:06:46  <ato> Cheers (-:
2011-04-18T07:07:19  <jimevans> the HTTP server interprets the HTTP request, and translates it into COM calls, driving IE.

2011-04-18T11:04:08  <jarib> is the plan still to do the --auto-close thing with chromedriver? i don't think that's the best solution
2011-04-18T11:04:36  *** andytinkham has quit IRC
2011-04-18T11:05:07  <jarib> i think it would make more sense to be able to shut down the server and detach from any open sessions/browser processes
2011-04-18T11:05:08  <jleyba> No, I believe we're just going to add a way to disassociate a browser from the chromedriver server

2011-04-18T12:05:07  <christophermcmah> RossPatterson: I have a REST endpoint that exposes some system data for test purposes that looks like:

2011-04-18T12:21:46  <RossPatterson> "check" fails with "[error] Element xpath=/items/bar is not a toggle-button. ", which makes sense, because "check" manipulates checkboxes.  either, as the file isn't HTML.

2011-04-18T12:39:51  <andytinkham> jarib: I see two ways to go: 1) Monkey patch Module so that every module automatically tracks who includes it
2011-04-18T12:40:23  <andytinkham> jarib: 2) Iterate over the list of subclasses of Page and use the include? method to find out if it contains the module when I need to get a list
2011-04-18T12:40:37  <andytinkham> jarib: Opinions on one over the other?
2011-04-18T12:41:20  <andytinkham> jarib: And corollary, am I missing a better option than either of those?

2011-04-18T13:09:26  <andytinkham> jarib: One of the modules has a tab that shows allergy information for the selected patient. I want to test that the correct information is shown on each page that that tab appears, and would prefer to not write a separate test for each one
2011-04-18T13:10:13  <jarib> makes sense
2011-04-18T13:11:42  <andytinkham> jarib: The main difference I see between options 1 and 2 is 1 has the potential for more unintended consequences (though since I'm adding functionality not changing existing functionaltiy, I don't think it's a big risk) and 2 will require more short methods (calling a base method that actually does the iteration, and passing in the appropriate module name)

2011-04-18T13:18:01  <andytinkham> jarib: Yeah, I think I'm leaning towards option #2 since that feels less wrong to me. I can ask each page object class if it has-a patient_tab_info bar essentially. The number of page objects is apt to never be big enough to make that intractable

2011-04-18T14:48:32  <XCulver> let me try
2011-04-18T14:49:09  <jimevans> thanks. it really helps to know if this happens in only one browser or in more than one.
2011-04-18T14:50:44  <XCulver> CurrentWebDriver.Manage().DeleteAllCookies(); just blew up in firefox, i must not have a profile or something
2011-04-18T14:51:25  <jimevans> that shouldn't happen. we should be creating an anonymous profile on the fly.
2011-04-18T14:52:03  <XCulver> i commented out the line and it worked in firefox
2011-04-18T14:52:10  <jimevans> ok, so ie only then.

2011-04-18T14:54:01  <XCulver> no
2011-04-18T14:54:06  <XCulver> its a short link called super.user

2011-04-18T14:56:57  <jimevans> great!
2011-04-18T14:57:12  <XCulver> is the zoom messing with the locator?
2011-04-18T14:57:22  <XCulver> i'm guessing click is finding coordinates based on normal zoom?
2011-04-18T14:57:35  <jimevans> getBoundingClientRect returns the size of the bounding client rectangle for the element, but when it's zoomed at 100%.
2011-04-18T14:57:47  <jimevans> we click in the center of the rectangle returned by getBoundingClientRect().
2011-04-18T14:58:04  <jimevans> we can only go by what the browser gives us.
2011-04-18T14:58:05  <XCulver> makes sense
2011-04-18T14:58:16  <XCulver> what about the ff exception when i clear cookies?
2011-04-18T14:58:28  <jimevans> got no idea about that one.

2011-04-18T14:59:06  <XCulver> i load a new driver and clear cookies before every test
2011-04-18T14:59:48  <XCulver> what do you think of my method of loading webelements?

2011-04-18T16:30:08  <davehunt> adamgoucher: I thought I'd gotten around this temporarily by extracting the build XPI file and using that as the proxy location, but I don't appear to be able to influence the add-on by hacking in selenium-browserbot.js
2011-04-18T16:31:26  <adamgoucher> once the boy is in bed (another hour) and i have more coffee (prior to his bed) i'll jus go through line by line and fix it
2011-04-18T16:31:31  <adamgoucher> unless you want to :)
2011-04-18T16:32:38  <davehunt> I don't understand it well enough
2011-04-18T16:32:58  <davehunt> I've tried to get my head around it before
2011-04-18T16:34:13  <adamgoucher> rake-tasks/se-ide.rb just needs to have the src of a whole bunch of copies be correct
2011-04-18T16:34:53  <davehunt> yeah, I tried that
2011-04-18T16:35:16  <davehunt> I still wasn't getting anywhere with running the addon as a proxy
2011-04-18T16:35:40  <adamgoucher> and the target -- i think you are correct about the selenium-core thing
2011-04-18T16:36:19  <adamgoucher> indeed you are -   <script type="application/x-javascript" src="chrome://selenium-ide/content/selenium-core/scripts/atoms.js"/>
2011-04-18T16:45:22  <davehunt> adamgoucher: debugging the long way round (edit, build, install) I've determined the cause of #1571,

2011-04-18T16:45:41  <davehunt> Not sure I understand why yet thou

2011-04-18T17:38:45  <davehunt> adamgoucher: still struggling to get Selenium IDE to run as a proxy extension :/
2011-04-18T17:41:24  <adamgoucher> so how far, if anywhere have you got?
2011-04-18T17:41:33  <adamgoucher> (as in, check in something if you have it ish working)
2011-04-18T17:41:41  <davehunt> Not even ish
2011-04-18T17:41:56  <davehunt> I launch Firefox but the extension is not listed
2011-04-18T17:42:07  <davehunt> Despite having the proxy file etc
2011-04-18T17:42:54  <davehunt> Think I'm going to give up soon

2011-04-18T18:06:38  <selbot2> adam_goucher@hotmail.com half a minute ago - AdamGoucher - see if this proxy file works. almost certainly wont on windows. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12041
2011-04-18T18:07:06  <adamgoucher> ping davehunt
2011-04-18T18:07:19  <davehunt> pong
2011-04-18T18:07:33  <adamgoucher> might have fixed it
2011-04-18T18:07:52  <adamgoucher> it runs clean at any rate :)
2011-04-18T18:07:59  <adamgoucher> and 'looks' righ
2011-04-18T18:07:59  <adamgoucher> t
2011-04-18T18:09:03  <davehunt> I might have to try it tomorrow

2011-04-18T18:19:08  <davehunt|away> cool
2011-04-18T18:19:16  <davehunt|away> It's 2:30am here
2011-04-18T18:19:26  <davehunt|away> I shouldn't be here :)
2011-04-18T18:20:39  <davehunt|away> btw, it looks like if I step through the unwrap code I get a window object that is a XPCNativeWrapper, however when I step over it I get a XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper. The latter causes the issue I discovered today.
2011-04-18T18:20:54  <davehunt|away> I won't pretend I understand any of that. :D
2011-04-18T18:21:02  <davehunt|away> Anyway, night!
2011-04-18T18:21:16  <adamgoucher> ask automatedtester about xraywrappers in the morning
