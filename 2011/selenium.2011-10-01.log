2011-10-01T15:57:27  <charmander> I have a series of recorded commands I apply to a base URL.  How can I iterativly apply those same commands to a set of base URLs sequentially (perhalps with a pause between each of them) ?
2011-10-01T15:58:24  <charmander> Instead of cut/pasting with hard coding the URLS.
2011-10-01T15:58:57  <charmander> err instead of cut pasting the same set of commands per base url.
