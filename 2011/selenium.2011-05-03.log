2011-05-03T06:08:31  *** mbeierl has quit IRC
2011-05-03T06:08:41  <hjb> opera doesn't accept the cybervillains ca and displays a popup
2011-05-03T06:09:19  <hjb> according to documentation that should work "out of the box" with firefox and opera, but not with IE
2011-05-03T06:09:53  <wilhelm_> You could either add the CA, bypass the dialog with keypresses or with Opera's propiertary UI APIs.
2011-05-03T06:10:55  *** mbeierl has joined #selenium
2011-05-03T06:10:59  <hjb> i've tried adding the CA but selenium vcreates a clean temp profile for opera
2011-05-03T06:11:19  <hjb> is there a way to specify a "template" profile to use instead?

2011-05-03T08:42:37  <shofetim> Hello all, I am working on getting an older client library for lisp working, but am having alot of problems connecting to the rc server.
2011-05-03T08:42:57  <shofetim> I have the server up and running, and can access it in a browser, and via commandline and curl
2011-05-03T08:43:24  <shofetim> but whenever I try and connect to it from lisp, I receive a "connection refused"
2011-05-03T08:43:27  <shofetim> error
2011-05-03T08:43:54  <shofetim> any ideas I could try?
2011-05-03T08:44:04  <RossPatterson> Sounds like a basic networking problem.  Selenium RC won't refuse your connections.
2011-05-03T08:44:38  <shofetim> humm... I am working on just one machine, so no wires etc.
2011-05-03T08:44:45  <shofetim> I can see the server in netstat
2011-05-03T08:45:00  <RossPatterson> Sure, but there may be firewalls, etc.
2011-05-03T08:45:09  <RossPatterson> Windows or Linux?
2011-05-03T08:45:15  <shofetim> and connect via curl and a browser at http://localhost:4444/selenium-server/driver/?cmd=testComplete
2011-05-03T08:45:17  <shofetim> linux
2011-05-03T08:45:21  <shofetim> no firewalls
2011-05-03T08:45:40  <shofetim> I was thinking the RC server might handle TCP oddly?
2011-05-03T08:45:45  <RossPatterson> Fire up tcpdump and check where your packets are really going to.
2011-05-03T08:45:58  <shofetim> let me man tcpdump...
2011-05-03T08:46:02  <RossPatterson> Nope.  It uses Jetty internally, but the TCP stack is basic Java.
2011-05-03T08:46:29  <RossPatterson> If you're not familiar with tcpdump, you might find Wireshark easier to use.
2011-05-03T08:47:03  <shofetim> *shrug* I tried some with wireshark, but I don't know enough about TCP to debug it.
2011-05-03T08:48:12  <shofetim> what I don't get is how it can be accessible with some programs and not with others...
2011-05-03T08:48:34  <shofetim> and its hard to believe that either selenium or lisp has a TCP error that hasn't surfaced until now...
2011-05-03T08:48:40  <RossPatterson> It can't.  That's why my money is on a setup problem with the client.
2011-05-03T08:51:31  <shofetim> that is what seems to be the case though... right now I can access it via curl or a browser (and several other ways) and I have a two line lisp program that can access any url EXCEPT http://localhost:4444/selenium-server/driver/?cmd=testComplete which is the url I CAN see in the browser or curl
2011-05-03T08:52:48  <DarkRift> you can probably paste your lisp

2011-05-03T09:21:40  <DarkRift> for this lisp, what's the "requires" or the import you need to make it functionnal ?
2011-05-03T09:21:54  <shofetim> (require net/url)
2011-05-03T09:22:08  <shofetim> its in the racket dialect
2011-05-03T09:22:17  <shofetim> http://racket-lang.org/
2011-05-03T09:23:48  <shofetim> (BTW several hours of hacking + the #racket irc haven't gotten anywhere... they think its probably Selenium Server's problem....)
2011-05-03T09:24:16  <DarkRift> humm ok well I thought I could use clojure to test your lisp and see if I coul make it work,, because I have absolutely no knowledge about lisp, but I wanted to debug it with wireshark after that
2011-05-03T09:24:41  <DarkRift> yeah, throwing the ball to the other party when you don't understand the problem
2011-05-03T09:24:49  <shofetim> : )
2011-05-03T09:24:49  <DarkRift> or don't find the answer
2011-05-03T09:25:10  <shofetim> *shrug* I've spent a abunch of hours on it but its over my head
2011-05-03T09:25:26  <shofetim> just filled a bug report with the origional authors of the lisp client library
2011-05-03T09:25:28  <shofetim> https://github.com/untyped/selenium/issues/1
2011-05-03T09:25:40  <shofetim> but I don't think they pay much attention to it.
2011-05-03T09:26:03  <shofetim> give me a few minutes and I can post a self contained program that reproduces the error
2011-05-03T09:29:31  <DarkRift> did you enable the -log option for your selenium server ?
2011-05-03T09:29:48  <shofetim> Yes, but the output didn't help me
2011-05-03T09:29:53  <DarkRift> there could probably be more information in this
2011-05-03T09:29:53  <DarkRift> ah
2011-05-03T09:32:17  <shofetim> one sec, will finish bug demonstrating program
2011-05-03T09:36:16  <DarkRift> ok
2011-05-03T09:37:31  <DarkRift> anyone here ? is it possible to change the default jsp page for the "console" so we can push our own "design" for the display ?
2011-05-03T09:37:48  <DarkRift> or at least add some custom CSS/javascript
2011-05-03T09:38:24  <DarkRift> this is about selenium 2 (Grid preferably)

2011-05-03T09:51:37  <RossPatterson> shofetim: That log shows that the Selenium server never received the request from the client.
2011-05-03T09:52:14  <ivog> do you have a pastebin of the code that's doing the request?
2011-05-03T09:52:56  <shofetim> http://pastebin.com/QZdeuL0M
2011-05-03T09:54:05  <ivog> ermm what's that supposed to do? :)
2011-05-03T09:54:05  <shofetim> Is there a way to explicitly bind the selenium server to an ip? such as 127.0.0.1 ?
2011-05-03T09:54:18  <ivog> you can use -host
2011-05-03T09:54:19  <RossPatterson> ivog: He's getting proper responses using the ".../selenium-server/..." URL from curl and from a browser address bar.
2011-05-03T09:54:58  <shofetim> ivog: take the first command line argument, turn it into a url (type cast) and then connect to it.
2011-05-03T09:55:09  <shofetim> (tcp connection, and return an input port to read from)
2011-05-03T09:56:45  <shofetim> unrecognized argument -host
2011-05-03T09:56:51  <shofetim> (selenium server)
2011-05-03T09:57:03  <RossPatterson> shoetim: The packet trace you uploaded shows what your client claims: Whatever is listening at port 4444 on the machine named "zen" sent a TCP RESET - it refused the connection.  But there's no evidence of that in the Selenium server log.
2011-05-03T09:57:27  <shofetim> zen is localhost, 4444 is selenium server
2011-05-03T09:58:36  <shofetim> java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar -log ~/Desktop/selenium.log -debug -port 4444
2011-05-03T09:58:36  <shofetim> 
2011-05-03T10:00:06  <ivog> hmm i guess -host can only be used when you use it as a grid node
2011-05-03T10:01:53  <ivog> so do you also send a request to the rc url?
2011-05-03T10:02:15  <shofetim> RossPatterson: exactly.... everything can connect except lisp, and lisp appears to be trying to connect properly, and all this should be impossible : )
2011-05-03T10:02:28  <shofetim> ivog: huh?
2011-05-03T10:03:43  <ivog> what are you trying to do exactly? sorry if i jump in in the middle of the story :)

2011-05-03T10:05:10  <shofetim> that library kept giving tcp errors, so I wrote a simple program to test tcp connection from lisp to selenium RC
2011-05-03T10:05:25  <shofetim> which says that selenium RC is refusing connections from lisp, and only from lisp.
2011-05-03T10:05:32  <DarkRift> and the problem is that I could execute correctly here
2011-05-03T10:05:33  <shofetim> Everything else is working fine.
2011-05-03T10:06:01  <shofetim> But DarkRift can run my test program and it works correctly...

2011-05-03T10:13:51  <shofetim> oh, and lisp can connect to anything other then selenium RC
2011-05-03T10:15:25  <DarkRift> is it a requirement that every test is linked to a particular browser ?
2011-05-03T10:16:38  <DarkRift> what if I wanted to have the same test executed on 3 different browsers ? I'd have to code the "framework" to manually bind it to the 3 different browsers ?
2011-05-03T10:17:08  <shofetim> DarkRift: I am pretty sure that is correct.
2011-05-03T10:17:18  <DarkRift> is there any notion of group in the grid ? like a test could be executed to the whole group ?
2011-05-03T10:17:35  <ivog> i dont think so
2011-05-03T10:17:41  <ivog> woops sorry
2011-05-03T10:17:53  <ivog> that answer was totally unrelated to anything
2011-05-03T10:20:21  <shofetim> interesting bit of info, maybe the start of my solution:
2011-05-03T10:20:26  <shofetim> http://localhost:4444/selenium-server/driver/?cmd=testComplete works
2011-05-03T10:20:34  <shofetim> http://127.0.0.1:4444/selenium-server/driver/?cmd=testComplete doesn't work
2011-05-03T10:20:42  <shofetim> http://zen:4444/selenium-server/driver/?cmd=testComplete doesn't work
2011-05-03T10:20:56  <DarkRift> that would be awesome ...
2011-05-03T10:20:59  <shofetim> but zen == localhost == 127.0.0.1 or it should

2011-05-03T10:24:06  <DarkRift> that should be fine
2011-05-03T10:25:38  <shofetim> DarkRift: so why if /etc/hosts is aliasing zen localhost and 127.0.0.1 can I only connect to selenium RC on localhost?
2011-05-03T10:27:34  <DarkRift> what do you get when you do an nslookup zen ?
2011-05-03T10:28:32  <DarkRift> hummm nvm, that will ask the server, not check the hosts file
2011-05-03T10:28:53  <shofetim> yeah... DNS server says not found
2011-05-03T10:29:10  <shofetim> but nslookup localhost gives back 127.0.0.1
2011-05-03T10:31:54  <DarkRift> hummm
2011-05-03T10:32:04  <DarkRift> wonder what's the step linux uses to determine the IP of a host
2011-05-03T10:32:18  <DarkRift> it should probably lookup the hosts file
2011-05-03T10:32:37  <DarkRift> but that is probably from what resolv.conf has in it
2011-05-03T10:33:10  <shofetim> *shrug* I thought it was always hosts file then dns servers
2011-05-03T10:33:35  <ivog> how do i run bug on windows do you just need racket?
2011-05-03T10:34:11  <shofetim> it may just run as is.
2011-05-03T10:34:24  <shofetim> does it error? (with something about racket ?)
2011-05-03T10:34:32  <shofetim> if so I'll make you a windows version
2011-05-03T10:36:09  <ivog> its an unrecognized program
2011-05-03T10:36:17  <ivog> do i run it using racket bug <url
2011-05-03T10:36:18  <ivog> >
2011-05-03T10:36:19  <ivog> ?
2011-05-03T10:37:04  <shofetim> do you have racket installed on your system?
2011-05-03T10:37:11  <ivog> yes
2011-05-03T10:37:17  <ivog> i just installed it :)
2011-05-03T10:37:39  <shofetim> I just checked, (I don't distribute binaries often) but I think I have to packege it from a windows machine for you to run it.
2011-05-03T10:37:54  <shofetim> One sec and I'll pastebin the source and you can just past it into a file
2011-05-03T10:38:00  <shofetim> and do racket filename.rtk

2011-05-03T10:39:12  <shofetim> where URL is the url you want to test connecting too.
2011-05-03T10:42:22  <ivog> yea that works for me too
2011-05-03T10:43:36  <RossPatterson> shofetim: The name resolution order is configurable on Linux.
2011-05-03T10:44:09  <RossPatterson> This all sounds like a host resolution problem.  And don't forget that on Linux, you've got IPv6 addresses in the mix.
2011-05-03T10:44:09  <shofetim> how?
2011-05-03T10:44:27  <shofetim> yes I was wondering about that too...
2011-05-03T10:44:35  <RossPatterson> I forget - it's a file in /etc that I always have to hunt for :-)
2011-05-03T10:44:48  <shofetim> resolve.conf?
2011-05-03T10:45:16  <DarkRift> resolv.conf
2011-05-03T10:45:27  <RossPatterson> Yeah, that's probably it.
2011-05-03T10:46:00  <RossPatterson> Doesn't matter, though - what nslookup says (or even what ping says) is what your program would use.
2011-05-03T10:46:00  <shofetim> mine just lists the default nameserver (my router)
2011-05-03T10:46:19  <DarkRift> nah, it's nsswitch.conf
2011-05-03T10:47:15  <RossPatterson> DOH.  Of course.  Still, highly unlikely to be the issue.
2011-05-03T10:47:23  <shofetim> looks like files is always the first goto, which should mean /etc/hosts ?
2011-05-03T10:47:30  <RossPatterson> Yes
2011-05-03T10:48:10  <shofetim> and /etc/hosts aliases localhost zen and 127.0.0.1 but selenium only responds to requests to localhost apparently
2011-05-03T10:48:51  <DarkRift> I think nsllookup doesn't care about that config tho, but ping seems to work according to that file
2011-05-03T10:49:04  <shofetim> which makes some sense... now I have to figure out a way to explicitly request localhost since lisp seems to be doing something "for me" that I didn't ask it too.... I guess
2011-05-03T10:49:33  *** esteele_ has joined #selenium
2011-05-03T10:50:04  <DarkRift> still, if it doesn't work with 127.0.0.1, the network config with those files have more likely nothing to do with it
2011-05-03T10:50:31  <shofetim> Dont know if this matters, but I can ping localhost, zen, and 127.0.0.1 all on port 4444
2011-05-03T10:50:48  <shofetim> just cant get a response from selenium unless the request is sent to localhost
2011-05-03T10:51:06  <DarkRift> probably it uses nslookup, which doesn't care about that file
2011-05-03T10:52:02  <RossPatterson> Gotta go.  Good luck.

2011-05-03T10:57:09  <shofetim> I guess it will have to wait.... I can't seem to figure it out, and I need to make progress today on the main project.

2011-05-03T10:57:30  <DarkRift> np
2011-05-03T10:59:32  <shofetim> BTW just tried a different more primitive connection type from lisp. Just a bare tcp-connect. I thought it might be something where the server was only responding if there was a GET /localhost in the http headers. But the bare bone tcp-connect function can't connect to localhost at 4444 but can connect to my webserver running at localhost 80... go figure eh?

2011-05-03T11:37:20  <DarkRift> I didn't think about IPv6, because my network doesn't support it

2011-05-03T15:09:12  <AutomatedTester> jleyba: he/she is looking for the rest commands for Se1
2011-05-03T15:09:19  <shofetim> I have been working with Selenium Server 2.0b3

2011-05-03T15:09:35  *** csanchez has quit IRC
2011-05-03T15:09:46  <AutomatedTester> or I am missing something... extremely tired
2011-05-03T15:09:47  <shofetim> this one: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/detail?name=selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar&can=2&q=
2011-05-03T15:09:56  <jleyba> Ah...yeah, I don't think there is anything like the JsonWireProtocol wiki for Se1
2011-05-03T15:10:40  <AutomatedTester> jleyba: I havent heard from Chromium about the RDFLIB issue, I assume its fixed?
2011-05-03T15:10:48  <AutomatedTester> after my fix
2011-05-03T15:10:53  <jleyba> The command format is extremely simple though.  You should be able to grok it pretty easily from looking at the java, python, perl, $random_reference_language
2011-05-03T15:11:12  <jleyba> AutomatedTester: I haven't heard anything either.  Let me ping Ken
2011-05-03T15:11:22  <shofetim> ok so I want to write an authoratative Lisp client library for Selenium 1 & 2. So if I want to be sure I have the full selenium 1 API I should just go through Seleniums source?
2011-05-03T15:11:22  <AutomatedTester> ta
2011-05-03T15:11:40  <AutomatedTester> shofetim: Read the source, Luke
2011-05-03T15:11:45  <shofetim> : )
2011-05-03T15:11:48  <shofetim> thnks
2011-05-03T15:11:59  <shofetim> I hate java too... ah well. Thanks guys
2011-05-03T15:12:19  <AutomatedTester> shofetim: python bindings might be useful
2011-05-03T15:12:24  <AutomatedTester> or the .NET bindings
2011-05-03T15:12:32  <AutomatedTester> and last time I checked they werent Java
2011-05-03T15:12:55  <shofetim> huh? I thought selenium was written in java?
2011-05-03T15:13:14  <AutomatedTester> there is client side code written in a number of different languages
2011-05-03T15:13:33  <shofetim> ok.
2011-05-03T15:13:35  <AutomatedTester> or are you wanting to rewrite the server code in Lisp?
2011-05-03T15:14:04  *** andytinkham has joined #selenium
2011-05-03T15:14:23  <AutomatedTester> kudos for wanting to write Lisp bindings
2011-05-03T15:15:16  <AutomatedTester> jleyba: If I hear nothing I assume the world is good
