2011-09-10T08:11:42  <krosenvold_> Ajay: Good morning
2011-09-10T08:11:54  <krosenvold_> I think the thing about the ephemeral settings on windows is as follows;
2011-09-10T08:12:13  <krosenvold_> Default is platform-specific, so if there are NO values in the registry platform defaults apply
2011-09-10T08:12:22  <Ajay> krosenvold_:Good Morning
2011-09-10T08:12:30  <krosenvold_> Registry values will cause different values to be effective
2011-09-10T08:12:47  <Ajay> krosenvold_: yeah you are correct

2011-09-10T08:16:44  <krosenvold_> But it's only relevant if whatever you're talking aboyt participates in some kind of serialization
2011-09-10T08:16:44  <Ajay> does it try to calculate in the runtime ?
2011-09-10T08:16:56  <krosenvold_> Only upon serialization
2011-09-10T08:17:19  * krosenvold_ wonders if we actually use java serialization anywhere
2011-09-10T08:17:26  <krosenvold_> We use everything else, so why not
