2011-06-04T01:28:34  <freynaud> lisak: have you tried about:config ?
2011-06-04T01:36:16  <lisak> damn, there isn't anything about starting FF with a profile
2011-06-04T01:36:51  <lisak> according to the documentation one can use this jvm option -Dwebdriver.firefox.profile to do that
2011-06-04T01:36:57  <lisak> but for me it doesn't work
2011-06-04T01:37:18  <lisak> and it doesn't seem there is a way to do that via firefox built-in preferences
2011-06-04T01:37:42  <lisak> java bindings
2011-06-04T01:38:29  <freynaud> selenium1 API or webdriver ?

2011-06-04T01:40:14  <lisak> yes, but it's a NEW profile, not the one I started FF in before and set it up
2011-06-04T01:40:23  <freynaud> that's better than before, the profile becomes a part of you test
2011-06-04T01:40:33  <freynaud> lisak: no it's not
2011-06-04T01:40:40  <freynaud> you can take an existing one as a base
2011-06-04T01:40:57  <freynaud> if you have one with firebug abd some certificate exception, it will use that

2011-06-04T01:43:00  <Binken[A]> freynaud, Should we install all browsers on the machine which is runing remotewebdriver

2011-06-04T01:43:00  * Binken is no longer away : Gone for 2 hours 47 minutes 14 seconds
2011-06-04T01:43:06  <Binken> freynaud, Should we install all browsers on the machine which is runing remotewebdriver
2011-06-04T01:43:45  <freynaud> Binken: RemoteWebDriver is what you use in your tests, it's only sending the orders
2011-06-04T01:44:07  <freynaud> you don't need any browser at all where you write your tests
2011-06-04T01:44:24  <freynaud> you need them where the webdriver server is running
2011-06-04T01:44:38  <Binken> understand
2011-06-04T01:44:47  <freynaud> if you don't use grid and have RemoteWebDriver(new URL(ABC, cap)
2011-06-04T01:44:54  <freynaud> you need them installed on ABC
2011-06-04T01:48:37  <Binken> So the remotewebdriver is the core module to communicate with the browsers
2011-06-04T01:48:51  <Binken> use the JSONWireProtocol
2011-06-04T01:50:30  <freynaud> it's what will generate the command, that will be JSON object sent via http
2011-06-04T01:52:30  <Binken> Very clear :)
2011-06-04T01:55:17  <Binken> freynaud, Do you run your test parallelly
2011-06-04T01:55:40  <freynaud> the tests support parallel run if you start them that way
2011-06-04T01:55:59  <freynaud> a webdriver server can start as many chrome or firefox as you want for instance
2011-06-04T01:56:38  <freynaud> so it's a matter of generating several tests in parallel, so that all request are recieved in parallel by the server
2011-06-04T01:56:50  <freynaud> and if you want to scale more, then grid comes into the picture
2011-06-04T01:57:05  <Mayank> Hi, all I have this SCORM code - http://pastebin.com/pN1NYu7M, which opens in a frame inside a php page, I am trying to test it. The problem is that this code has an alert on line number 182 that is not getting "suppressed" by selenium, the tests fail as I do not have any method for detecting the alert as selenium cannot detect this alert thus, i cannot use assertAlert of waitForAlert, stuck on this from the past 5 days! :/
2011-06-04T01:58:25  <Binken> For now, I am running all the automated tests on local machine not webdriver server. And I run three type of browsers per case
2011-06-04T01:58:57  <Binken> I run these testcase one by one, Since each testcase has it's own input data
2011-06-04T01:59:08  <freynaud> are you running RemoteWebDriver
2011-06-04T01:59:20  <Binken> For now, no
2011-06-04T01:59:21  <freynaud> or FirefoxDriver etc
2011-06-04T01:59:38  <Binken> I am running use the FirefoxDriver etc
2011-06-04T01:59:45  <freynaud> you can try with Remote, that will avoid you some refactoring later
2011-06-04T02:02:07  <Binken> If I use the Remote, I have to use the java command run the selenium server?
2011-06-04T02:02:41  <freynaud> either that
2011-06-04T02:02:48  <freynaud> or you can have it started by your test
2011-06-04T02:03:15  <freynaud> if you use JUnit , have setup starting it
2011-06-04T02:03:29  <Binken> For now, I have not find the best solution for my current test enviroment
2011-06-04T02:03:40  <freynaud> an later, the only refactoring you'll need it to change localhost to the remote server where it run or where grid runs
2011-06-04T02:03:42  *** towski has joined #selenium
2011-06-04T02:03:54  <Binken> I know you mean :)
2011-06-04T02:05:13  <Binken> Sound reasonable
2011-06-04T02:08:46  <Binken> Freynaud, If you have one testcase with inputdata wanted to be run in mutiple browsers, what will you plan to do this?
2011-06-04T02:09:18  <freynaud> it depends on the test framework you use and how complex you tests are
2011-06-04T02:09:45  <Binken> I am current using NUnit
2011-06-04T02:09:59  <freynaud> if the test has no other param and you're using java, I would use testNG and a dataprovider returning the list of browser capabilities you're interested in
2011-06-04T02:10:01  <Binken> Tests are not so complex right now
2011-06-04T02:10:19  <freynaud> i'm not familiar with the .net world :)
2011-06-04T02:10:35  <Binken> I think the idea is same :)
2011-06-04T02:11:53  <freynaud> yes, it's the same in the sense it will not be solved by selenium
2011-06-04T02:12:08  <freynaud> tests corretly built with selenium will allow it
2011-06-04T02:12:27  <freynaud> but the test framework you use will input the param and config you want

2011-06-04T02:17:44  *** towski has quit IRC

2011-06-04T02:56:38  <freynaud> why are you trying to attach to an existing ff in the fiist place ?
2011-06-04T03:01:40  <lisak> because I'm using these test when developing to see how the code behave
2011-06-04T03:01:54  <lisak> so I run it quite often

2011-06-04T03:02:27  <freynaud> at the end of you test, the FF should be closed
2011-06-04T03:02:34  <freynaud> there should be no left over
2011-06-04T03:02:37  <lisak> I could have FF window full of tabs instead
2011-06-04T03:07:12  <lisak> freynaud, pls excuse my basic knowledge absence ... i'm using webdriver 10 days without being aware of driver.close();
2011-06-04T03:07:22  <lisak> thanks :)
2011-06-04T03:07:31  <freynaud> driver.close isn't closing the driver :)
2011-06-04T03:07:44  <lisak> it makes the FF close :)
2011-06-04T03:07:50  <freynaud> it's closing the browser window, and the driver if that was the last window
2011-06-04T03:08:04  <freynaud> if you want to close everything for sure, it's driver.quit
2011-06-04T03:08:37  <lisak> the driver can "fork" into many windows ?
2011-06-04T03:09:04  <lisak> ok, I'll take a look at that
2011-06-04T03:09:05  <freynaud> you can have a new firefox window opening if you have popups etc

2011-06-04T07:10:17  <__mike> what you trying to do ? i've fiddled with junit
2011-06-04T07:12:41  <freynaud> i'd like to do what i can do in testNG
2011-06-04T07:12:57  <freynaud> I have a method that is suppose to block due to a timeout
2011-06-04T07:13:20  <freynaud> so I want @Test(timeout=2000 ,expected=timeoutException)
2011-06-04T07:13:24  <freynaud> smething like that
2011-06-04T07:13:42  <freynaud> but with junit, timeout throws java.lang.Exception
2011-06-04T07:14:00  <freynaud> and if I say expect=Exception.class, and it throws that, it fails anyway
2011-06-04T07:14:22  <freynaud> timeout probably always fails a method, independently of the expected tag
2011-06-04T07:16:29  <__mike> lemme fiddle around
2011-06-04T07:16:37  <__mike> so basically you want a test to pass even if it throws an exception right ?
2011-06-04T07:17:14  <freynaud> no, I want to the test to pass ONLY if it throw
2011-06-04T07:17:49  <freynaud> it's supposed to block until something happens.I test that it never returns if that something doesn't happen

2011-06-04T07:25:28  <freynaud> the method never returning will never return
2011-06-04T07:25:51  <freynaud> so if I put that in a test, with timeout=2000, I should have the timeout
2011-06-04T07:26:04  <freynaud> that throw a java.lang.Exception from Junit
2011-06-04T07:26:06  <__mike> ahhh
2011-06-04T07:26:13  <__mike> and the expected doesn't catch that right

2011-06-04T07:28:38  <freynaud> yeah, my guess is that junit should throw a timeoutException, and that should be handle by the expected, if any
2011-06-04T07:29:47  <__mike> yes. i think if you wanted to override.. you could do it from BlockJUnit4ClassRunner by overriding how withPotentialTimeout works :/
2011-06-04T07:29:58  <__mike> it's not a very nice method though
2011-06-04T07:31:08  <__mike> you could also kick off another thread within your unit test that does the timeout. and throws an exception. that way it would get caught by the 'expected'
2011-06-04T07:31:38  <freynaud> if i start another thread
2011-06-04T07:31:46  <freynaud> and anythign happens in it, junit will pass :p
2011-06-04T07:32:11  <freynaud> if I start doing all that, 50% chance i'll spend more time debugging the tests than the real code :)

2011-06-04T08:29:29  <freynaud> i plan to do some kind of helper for that
2011-06-04T08:29:56  <freynaud> but it's not really grid. If you have a llarge system, you should have some programatic way of knowing what's where
2011-06-04T08:30:04  <freynaud> and generate the registration requetss from that
2011-06-04T08:30:21  <barancev> config files would help
2011-06-04T08:30:57  <freynaud> the thing is, if you have a lot of nodes
2011-06-04T08:31:14  <freynaud> you probably want them to be managed from a central point, like from the hub machine
2011-06-04T08:31:40  <freynaud> what I do is generate the registration request from the hub itself.
2011-06-04T08:32:04  <freynaud> for instance if it's a linux, I know I have chrome and firefox 3 and 4 on it
2011-06-04T08:32:09  <barancev> yes, and I'd like to see from a centrac console what browsers are installed on each node
2011-06-04T08:32:19  <freynaud> I have a script that ssh from the hub to the linux, start webdriver server
2011-06-04T08:32:37  <freynaud> and from the hub, generate a reg request, inserting the IP
2011-06-04T08:33:10  <barancev> and I don't want a test to be sheduled to a node that has no appropriate browser installed
2011-06-04T08:33:24  <freynaud> i don't think I can build that generic enoughI It's very much linked to your system.
2011-06-04T08:33:41  <barancev> that's why I mentioned config files
2011-06-04T08:33:42  <freynaud> for instance when I register a node, the machine doesn't have to even exist
2011-06-04T08:33:52  <freynaud> if it doesn't, it starts a VM automatically etc
2011-06-04T08:34:03  <freynaud> so it's very much coupled to my system
2011-06-04T08:34:14  <barancev> a kind of node descriptiors
2011-06-04T08:34:32  <freynaud> I don't want a test to be schedule"
2011-06-04T08:34:41  <freynaud> that should already work
2011-06-04T08:34:55  <barancev> ok, I mean dispatched
2011-06-04T08:35:03  <freynaud> if you request a firefox, and you grid doesn't know firefox, it will throw an exception right away
2011-06-04T08:35:41  <barancev> if I request ff, I'd like a test to be dispatched to a node that has it installed
2011-06-04T08:36:25  <freynaud> that's already what grid does. I will iterate all the node, until one becomes available for what you asked
2011-06-04T08:36:58  <freynaud> the config file kind of exist already, the request is a JSON object. You don't need to have the selfRegisteringNode producing it
2011-06-04T08:37:07  <freynaud> you can create it yourself and send it
2011-06-04T08:37:14  <barancev> so, if a node can't start a test in FF, the grid will try another node?
2011-06-04T08:37:49  <freynaud> yes. It will look at all the node, and take the first one that matches at least what you ask
2011-06-04T08:38:19  <barancev> does not that affect preformance?
2011-06-04T08:38:20  <freynaud> if you ask for firefox, without specifying the OS, it will take the first available, on linux on win. If you specify the os, it will take that into account etc
2011-06-04T08:38:49  <freynaud> it's not really noticeable I think. Starting a firefox takes 4-5 seconds
2011-06-04T08:39:22  <barancev> suppose I have a network of 20 nodes, 10 WIn+IE and 10 Lin+FF
2011-06-04T08:39:33  <freynaud> if you start having so many nodes that iterating through them becomes visible compared to 5-6 sec, you'll have other issues: )
2011-06-04T08:39:49  <freynaud> you won't see it
2011-06-04T08:40:04  <freynaud> the unit tests run with 500 nodes
2011-06-04T08:40:37  <barancev> when I ask for FF, the grid may make up to 10 requests to Win nodes until it could find Lin with FF
2011-06-04T08:40:49  <freynaud> oh, no
2011-06-04T08:40:57  <freynaud> grid is the central point
2011-06-04T08:41:06  <freynaud> it keeps track of all running tests, where etc
2011-06-04T08:41:37  <freynaud> when a node register to the hub, it gives all the possible capabilities
2011-06-04T08:42:10  <freynaud> the hub remmebers that, all the test running etc, and it will only send a FF request to a node if the resources are free
2011-06-04T08:42:34  <freynaud> the filtering is done on the hub. For instance webdriver server will accept as many new FF request as you send
2011-06-04T08:42:48  <barancev> that's what I asked about - how a node understand its capabilities to report it to hub? the node should know, what browsers are available in the system
2011-06-04T08:43:09  <freynaud> if you send 1000 request to a server, it will accept them all and crash. The hub will make sure only MAX_INSTANCES are fowrwaded
2011-06-04T08:43:34  <freynaud> it doesn't at the moment it trust the person registering it
2011-06-04T08:43:43  <freynaud> it assumes firefox and chrome are always there
2011-06-04T08:43:51  <freynaud> and that IE is always there on windows
2011-06-04T08:44:11  <freynaud> that's if you register using -role webdriver
2011-06-04T08:44:17  <freynaud> without specifying anything else
2011-06-04T08:44:22  <barancev> can I configure node capabilities when I start it?
2011-06-04T08:44:25  <freynaud> yes
2011-06-04T08:45:01  <freynaud> -role webdriver -browser browserName=firefox,version=3,6 -browser browserName=chrome,version=13
2011-06-04T08:45:30  <freynaud> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2
2011-06-04T08:45:38  <freynaud> you have more example there
2011-06-04T08:46:27  <barancev> that's the way to specify version. but how to say "there is no chrome here"
2011-06-04T08:46:50  <barancev> maxInstances=0 ?
2011-06-04T08:47:10  <freynaud> as soon as you start specifying the browsers yourself
2011-06-04T08:47:16  <freynaud> the default are ignored
2011-06-04T08:47:31  <freynaud> -browser browserName=firefox
2011-06-04T08:47:38  <freynaud> will register a single firefoxx
2011-06-04T08:48:40  <barancev> wow! that's important, and missing from docs, thanks!
2011-06-04T08:48:49  <freynaud> is it ?
2011-06-04T08:49:34  <barancev> is it important or is it missing? :)
2011-06-04T08:50:55  <freynaud> it's important, and it's not missing anymore

2011-06-04T08:55:07  *** drim has joined #selenium
2011-06-04T08:55:39  <drim> will ChromeDriver get merged back into the standalone selenium server jar   with the next release?
2011-06-04T08:56:48  <freynaud> i don't think so
2011-06-04T08:57:12  <freynaud> chrome driver is done by the chrome time, they have a different release process
2011-06-04T08:58:01  <drim> freynaud: I don't understand. ChromeDriver was into the 2.0b3 release. Now it's separate, not sure why..  What do you mean different release process ?
2011-06-04T08:58:44  <freynaud> chrome driver use to be done by the selenium team. It was part of the selenium project.
2011-06-04T08:58:54  <drim> and no longer is ?
2011-06-04T08:59:12  <barancev> there is ChromeDriver java class in rc2, that uses chromedriver.exe as an external process
2011-06-04T08:59:16  <freynaud> it's now done by the chrome team directly. They implement the selenium API directly into chrome. It means direct access to everything, much faster
2011-06-04T08:59:41  <drim> so it's getting better. but chromedriver binary will remain separate
2011-06-04T08:59:44  <freynaud> but it also means chrome driver is now part of chrome, not f selenium
2011-06-04T08:59:49  <freynaud> correct
2011-06-04T09:00:07  <drim> and from your side you only put some bindings ..
2011-06-04T09:00:16  <freynaud> the same way we don't include chrome or firefox as part of selenium
2011-06-04T09:00:29  <drim> ?
2011-06-04T09:00:40  <drim> firefox driver is built into the standalone
2011-06-04T09:00:47  <drim> and Opera just got in with the rc1
2011-06-04T09:00:49  <freynaud> yes, selenium define the JSONWireProtocol as the standard API
2011-06-04T09:00:54  <freynaud> and chrome team implements it
2011-06-04T09:01:05  <barancev> opera is like chrome
2011-06-04T09:01:14  <freynaud> which means you can still switch from chrome driver to any other driver without changing a single line of your test
2011-06-04T09:01:51  <barancev> you need a separate operadriver.exe to run OperaDriver binding
2011-06-04T09:01:55  <drim> yep I get that. I'm was just curious technically will they get into one single server jar. But understand not.  While the rest will be in the standalone right ?
2011-06-04T09:02:11  <drim> barancev I haven't downloaded any standalone opera driver
2011-06-04T09:02:18  <drim> maybe it got installed with opera itself
2011-06-04T09:02:26  <drim> I run the server on linux btw
2011-06-04T09:02:40  <freynaud> drim: all the driver developped by selenium are in the standalone
2011-06-04T09:03:21  <freynaud> the plan is to slowly move away from "selenium team does all driver" to  browser team like mozilla or MS do their drivers
2011-06-04T09:03:50  <freynaud> chrome team just happen to be the first team doing that
2011-06-04T09:04:00  <barancev> operadriver is developer by Opera Software -- http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/operadriver/
2011-06-04T09:04:22  <barancev> may be it is bundled with Opera browser, I'm not sure
2011-06-04T09:04:44  <drim> barancev: I see I'll check it out
2011-06-04T09:05:18  <drim> so in future all browsers will provide separate binary drivers and selenium itself will have only the core functionality ?
2011-06-04T09:05:57  <barancev> that's the goal
2011-06-04T09:06:37  *** Archdude_ has joined #selenium
2011-06-04T09:07:03  <barancev> but there are IE and Safari, and who knows what MS and Apple think about that goal :)
2011-06-04T09:07:15  <drim> I still think that it would be more convinient for people if it was all bundled in one standalone. Browsers can still do drivers them selves but just merge them in the selenium server...
2011-06-04T09:07:24  <freynaud> apple is pretty open I think
2011-06-04T09:07:44  <drim> safari 5 got plugins which makes it possible in theory now
2011-06-04T09:07:49  <barancev> but Safari support is the worst
2011-06-04T09:07:51  <freynaud> drim: the chrome driver is linked to a version of chrome
2011-06-04T09:08:12  <freynaud> so we would have to have them all, for all platform
2011-06-04T09:08:38  <freynaud> have you tried to checkout the source lately :) It's already slightly too big ^^
2011-06-04T09:08:49  <drim> freynaud: gotcha. So browsers would eventually install drivers with the browser tiself ?
2011-06-04T09:09:07  <freynaud> as an addon probably
2011-06-04T09:09:13  <freynaud> not everybody test
2011-06-04T09:09:14  <freynaud> :)
2011-06-04T09:09:23  *** Archdude_ has quit IRC
2011-06-04T09:09:26  *** Archdude has quit IRC
2011-06-04T09:09:28  <drim> true, but if it's 500kb binary who cares
2011-06-04T09:10:01  <barancev> i's 500k for each major version of each supported browser
2011-06-04T09:10:07  *** Archdude has joined #selenium
2011-06-04T09:10:54  <drim> hey one more question
2011-06-04T09:10:59  <barancev> and if a vendor fixed a bug in a driver - should a new selenium release be issued?
2011-06-04T09:11:04  <drim> any hints how to make the firefox browser start in fullscreen
2011-06-04T09:11:22  <drim> barancev: right this makes sense I agree
2011-06-04T09:11:47  <freynaud> you can use JS for that
2011-06-04T09:11:57  <drim> how ?
2011-06-04T09:12:10  <drim> as far as I read clean JS cant go fullscreen
2011-06-04T09:12:22  <drim> I can change browser window position and resize it
2011-06-04T09:12:33  <drim> but go to true fullscreen.. don't know how
2011-06-04T09:12:34  <barancev> window.moveTo(0,0);window.resizeTo(screen.width,screen.height);
2011-06-04T09:12:40  <drim> that's not fullscreen
2011-06-04T09:12:56  <freynaud> no idea
2011-06-04T09:13:07  <freynaud> why do you want it full screen ?`
2011-06-04T09:13:17  <drim> well I want to have constant active space
2011-06-04T09:13:24  <drim> if I test with 4 different browsers
2011-06-04T09:13:29  <drim> I want to test same resolution
2011-06-04T09:13:37  <drim> so I want to get toolbars and stuff out of the way
2011-06-04T09:13:50  <drim> basically all display size would be equal to active testing space
2011-06-04T09:13:54  <barancev> or you may emulate F11 key
2011-06-04T09:14:05  <drim> right , how to emulate it with JS
2011-06-04T09:14:20  <barancev> no, not JS
2011-06-04T09:14:25  <drim> why is there no such api in selenium
2011-06-04T09:14:28  <barancev> on OS level
2011-06-04T09:14:33  <drim> something like browser.window.maximize
2011-06-04T09:14:37  <drim> browser.window.minize
2011-06-04T09:14:41  <freynaud> what will that test do ? Users don't browser in full screen mode
2011-06-04T09:14:42  <drim> browser.window.fullscreen
2011-06-04T09:15:02  <barancev> #1750 - you may vote for it :)
2011-06-04T09:15:03  <selbot2>  open/new There is no native way to move, resize or manipulate with browser window. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1750
2011-06-04T09:15:19  <drim> barancev: I will ! :)
2011-06-04T09:15:55  <drim> freynaud: You don't need to emulate the full user experience for web testing . you don't test the inteface of chrome and the os. you care about the website itself
2011-06-04T09:16:14  <drim> freynaud: so you want so how it works when rendered in given resolutions
2011-06-04T09:17:37  <freynaud> i still don't get it. If you are in 1280*1024 full screen and it looks ok, what does it tell you ?
2011-06-04T09:18:02  <freynaud> it doesn't validate that a user with a screen that size will be ok, as he will have the menu bar and stuff
2011-06-04T09:18:54  <__mike> drim. what do you want to do ? get the same client size or window size of the browsers ?
2011-06-04T09:19:26  <drim> same active view size
2011-06-04T09:19:28  <__mike> freynaud : one usecase could be if the site is designed for mobile then you want to limit the size to say 480x320
2011-06-04T09:19:36  <drim> in other words without toolbars and things
2011-06-04T09:19:49  <__mike> okay. afaik this can not be done with javascript
2011-06-04T09:19:51  <__mike> firefox you can do it
2011-06-04T09:20:01  <drim> I've done it already for Chrome and Opera
2011-06-04T09:20:11  <__mike> for IE i believe you can't
2011-06-04T09:20:19  <__mike> how are you doing it with chrome and opera right now
2011-06-04T09:20:24  <drim> I've modified the startup scripts that that start them (Linux)
2011-06-04T09:20:42  <drim> is a bash script that starts chrome binary
2011-06-04T09:20:52  <drim> oh the last message didn't show up
2011-06-04T09:20:53  <__mike> and you can specify client size with that ?
2011-06-04T09:20:54  <drim> so...
2011-06-04T09:20:59  <drim> no
2011-06-04T09:21:03  <freynaud> __mike: mobile is less flexible, there won't be extra bars and stuff. If you know the screen is 420, you know the fix size of the toolbar and can find the size you need for your canvas
2011-06-04T09:21:03  <drim> it's a virtual machine
2011-06-04T09:21:11  <drim> I change resolution with X api.
2011-06-04T09:21:16  <drim> xrandr -s XxY
2011-06-04T09:21:21  <drim> then start browser at Fullscreen
2011-06-04T09:21:35  <__mike> oh
2011-06-04T09:21:57  <drim> I've modified Chrome and Opera at the test system to run in Fullscreen by default
2011-06-04T09:22:15  <__mike> i see what you're trying to do now
2011-06-04T09:22:36  <__mike> but given that firefox javascript engine allows you to accurately size the viewport, i don't see why you can't do that for ff at least
2011-06-04T09:23:34  <drim> __mike: what do you mean? I could resize it but I want fullscreen so that it's consistent with other browsers. sort a uniform solution
2011-06-04T09:24:05  <drim> it would have been best if firefox had some parameter to start in fullscreen (like Chrome and Opera)
2011-06-04T09:24:08  <drim> but it doesnt
2011-06-04T09:24:32  <freynaud> if you're in a VM, it's easier I guess
2011-06-04T09:25:01  <freynaud> you can start a VM with screen resolution = the resulution you need + 200px / 200px
2011-06-04T09:25:14  <freynaud> then resize the canvas to the exact size you want
2011-06-04T09:25:23  <drim> how are you sure that the bars would be 200px exactly ?
2011-06-04T09:25:34  <drim> they would vary based on the browser
2011-06-04T09:25:36  <freynaud> make it 1000px if you want
2011-06-04T09:25:52  <freynaud> you just need enough free space so that when you resize the canvas it fits
2011-06-04T09:25:56  <drim> right but can JavaScript set the active area size ?
2011-06-04T09:26:01  <freynaud> yes
2011-06-04T09:26:01  <drim> I think it has api to resize window
2011-06-04T09:26:06  <drim> but not active aria
2011-06-04T09:26:08  <drim> area*
2011-06-04T09:26:39  <drim> can you give example how to set canvas to 800x600 with JS (if of cource the display is big enough)
2011-06-04T09:27:31  <drim> also this JS resize.. will it work on all browsers? __mike said something about FF java engine particularly
2011-06-04T09:27:40  <freynaud> window.resizeTo(800,600};
2011-06-04T09:27:41  <freynaud> ?
2011-06-04T09:29:33  <drim> I don't know much JS. let me try it.. I believe this resizes t he window
2011-06-04T09:29:56  <drim> so the actual canvas would be 800x600  -  length_of_bars X height_of_bars
2011-06-04T09:31:33  <barancev> window.resizeTo changes the sise of the window (with toolbars, statusbast etc), not canvas

2011-06-04T09:51:52  *** reddeviL is now known as red^
2011-06-04T09:58:19  <barancev> Jakes: Selenium works with DOM and can identify only elements that are in DOM
2011-06-04T10:08:17  <Jakes> Barancev: Oh! Is there a work around? I see a asp.net tag like <xyz:cuztomlistbox> which gets a event function from a HTC file.
2011-06-04T10:09:21  <barancev> if you can see this element in DOM tree (in IE click F12 to start dev tools) -- selenium will be able to fing this element, probably

2011-06-04T10:13:07  <Jakes> Is there a workaround?
2011-06-04T10:13:21  <barancev> as a workaround you can use custom javascript code to access this component
2011-06-04T10:15:02  <Jakes> So, I should try getting the element object using my JavaScript code?
2011-06-04T10:17:17  <Jakes> Ok I will give it a try Thank

2011-06-04T15:17:35  <Mayank> Mayank: Hi, all I have this SCORM code - http://pastebin.com/pN1NYu7M, which opens in a frame inside a php page, I am trying to test it. The problem is that this code has an alert on line number 182 that is not getting "suppressed" by selenium, the tests fail as I do not have any method for detecting the alert as selenium cannot detect this alert thus, i cannot use assertAlert or waitForAlert, stuck on this from the past 5 days! :/
2011-06-04T15:19:53  <barancev> Mayank: do you know why the alert is not suppressed?
2011-06-04T15:20:16  <Mayank> barancev: that is what i do not know
2011-06-04T15:20:46  <Mayank> barancev: even if i use window.alert = null; the alert is not being suppressed
2011-06-04T15:21:01  <Mayank> as in , sometimes it does, sometimes it does not
2011-06-04T15:21:41  <Mayank> I am not sure where to add - window.alert = null; in the Selenes HTML script
2011-06-04T15:22:59  <barancev> Mayank: aha, I see, it is called from body onLoad
2011-06-04T15:23:23  <Mayank> barancev: yes, but it should be supressed, should it be?
2011-06-04T15:23:48  <Mayank> by selenium itself.
2011-06-04T15:24:05  <Mayank> I am using IE 8

2011-06-04T15:28:11  <barancev> Selenium does NOT support JavaScript alerts that are generated in a page's onload()
2011-06-04T15:29:21  <barancev> that can help: http://thoughtstoblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/selenium-alert-and-confirm-in-pages.html
2011-06-04T15:33:43  <Mayank> barancev: but Selenium does suppresses onLoad alerts right? Am I wrong?
2011-06-04T15:34:31  <Mayank> any idea how I can "inject" JavaScript through Selenese HTML script?
2011-06-04T15:34:36  <Mayank> and thanks for the link.
