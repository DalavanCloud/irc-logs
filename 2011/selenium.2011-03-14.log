2011-03-14T07:54:27  <jimevans> morning, simonstewart.
2011-03-14T07:54:34  <simonstewart> Hi Jim
2011-03-14T07:54:38  <simonstewart> Good weekend?
2011-03-14T07:54:47  <jimevans> not particularly.
2011-03-14T07:54:53  <simonstewart> Sorry to hear that
2011-03-14T07:55:02  <jimevans> it happens. today's a new day.
2011-03-14T07:55:10  <simonstewart> Saw your tweet about the world and getting out of bed
2011-03-14T07:55:16  <simonstewart> Yes, yes it is
2011-03-14T07:55:21  <simonstewart> "IE9 release day"
2011-03-14T07:55:43  <jimevans> i'm really hoping to get ie9 support stablized and checked in today.
2011-03-14T07:55:50  <simonstewart> Excellent :)
2011-03-14T07:55:56  <simonstewart> I'm running the tests now
2011-03-14T07:56:03  <simonstewart> It's not happy on my win7 box
2011-03-14T07:56:15  <simonstewart> But then my win7 box has been acting odd for a while
2011-03-14T07:56:21  <simonstewart> Furrfu
2011-03-14T07:56:27  <jimevans> i hear you
2011-03-14T07:56:38  *** sfbrian has joined #selenium
2011-03-14T07:56:46  <jimevans> is that windows 7 with ie 9?
2011-03-14T07:56:49  <simonstewart> Yeah
2011-03-14T07:56:56  <simonstewart> 32 and 64 bit
2011-03-14T07:57:02  <simonstewart> I think my machine is somewhat hosed
2011-03-14T07:57:10  <jimevans> yeah, there's a number of things that won't be happy until i get this checked in.
2011-03-14T07:57:38  <simonstewart> Oh ok.
2011-03-14T07:57:42  <simonstewart> I'll relax then :)
2011-03-14T07:57:50  <simonstewart> Anything you need a hand with?
2011-03-14T07:58:14  <jimevans> no, i think i got it. the new script execution method seems less stable than the previous one.
2011-03-14T07:58:15  *** kpiwko has quit IRC
2011-03-14T07:58:29  <simonstewart> But it works even if there's no script engine?
2011-03-14T07:58:59  <jimevans> yes. or more correctly, it makes the browser more prone to timing failures when you attempt to focus other windows.
2011-03-14T07:59:14  <simonstewart> That's interesting
2011-03-14T07:59:31  <jimevans> but that's just perception. i've no hard data to back it up.
2011-03-14T07:59:42  <simonstewart> I guess that since we've decoupled the execution from the extraction of the result there's a danger that we introduced a race condition
2011-03-14T07:59:59  <jimevans> quite likely
2011-03-14T08:01:58  <jimevans> right now the biggest challenge is making sure things work on *all* versions of ie we support.
2011-03-14T08:02:38  <simonstewart> Indeed
2011-03-14T08:02:44  <simonstewart> IE6 fighting back?
2011-03-14T08:02:55  *** LRain has joined #selenium
2011-03-14T08:03:01  <simonstewart> I noticed that the execScript method was never happy on IE 7 if there wasn't already a JS engine running
2011-03-14T08:03:46  <jimevans> not really. i figured out my crash in ie6, but now i have to adjust other code to that fix.
2011-03-14T08:04:08  <simonstewart> I appreciate the hard work.
2011-03-14T08:04:11  <simonstewart> Thank you
2011-03-14T08:04:30  <jimevans> ie7 is on my list for later today. 6, 8, and 9 are at the forefront (simply because I have those environments up at the moment)
2011-03-14T08:05:16  <simonstewart> Aye
2011-03-14T08:05:30  <simonstewart> I've got some patches to internal frameworks to land
2011-03-14T08:05:41  <simonstewart> Then off to the fair with Firefox 4 and Selenium Core
2011-03-14T08:05:45  <simonstewart> Which is fubarred
2011-03-14T08:06:17  <jimevans> got a sick boy today too, so i need to get him to the doc this afternoon.
2011-03-14T08:06:51  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: if you have no luck with FF4 by wednesday let me know
2011-03-14T08:07:07  <simonstewart> jimevans: looking after the boy is the most important thing
2011-03-14T08:07:15  <jimevans> agreed. :)(
2011-03-14T08:07:20  <jimevans> or :)
2011-03-14T08:07:25  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: I've been struggling with it all weekend
2011-03-14T08:07:38  <simonstewart> Slowly getting there, but there's some systemic problems, I think
2011-03-14T08:08:09  <AutomatedTester> ok, I am finishing off things today, travelling for a Mozilla labs thing tomorrow
2011-03-14T08:08:25  <AutomatedTester> but wednesday is going to be "OMG I need to code day"
2011-03-14T08:08:29  <simonstewart> Heh.
2011-03-14T08:08:37  <simonstewart> You know, I fixed things up so you can code on a plane now
2011-03-14T08:08:39  <jimevans> biab.

2011-03-14T08:09:20  <AutomatedTester> assuming I can get power
2011-03-14T08:09:26  <simonstewart> Sweet, sweet power.

2011-03-14T08:10:03  <simonstewart> Virgin do in premium economy
2011-03-14T08:10:04  <simonstewart> and up
2011-03-14T08:10:13  <AutomatedTester> South West Trains... what do you think
2011-03-14T08:10:39  <simonstewart> Virgin trains have plugs
2011-03-14T08:10:43  <simonstewart> SW trains might
2011-03-14T08:11:23  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart :never seen them :(
2011-03-14T08:11:26  <simonstewart> But a quick google suggests not

2011-03-14T08:11:43  <simonstewart> Wow. When did we start doing that?
2011-03-14T08:12:33  <AutomatedTester> doing what?
2011-03-14T08:12:49  <simonstewart> I expected that link to be a link to the site
2011-03-14T08:12:56  <simonstewart> not to a page in google
2011-03-14T08:13:13  <simonstewart> Filing a bug about that
2011-03-14T08:13:18  <AutomatedTester> i went to the site
2011-03-14T08:13:29  <AutomatedTester> try a proper browser :P
2011-03-14T08:13:40  <simonstewart> It redirects to the site
2011-03-14T08:13:45  <simonstewart> That's a different thing entirely
2011-03-14T08:14:21  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: did you see the interview with Gary Kovacs on Fox Business news last week?

2011-03-14T08:36:36  <Kn|t3> hi
2011-03-14T08:36:42  <Kn|t3> i just started using selenium
2011-03-14T08:36:47  <Kn|t3> it gets stuck
2011-03-14T08:36:55  <Kn|t3> after Checing Resources aliases
2011-03-14T08:37:00  <Kn|t3> ny idea?
2011-03-14T08:39:14  <Kn|t3> no one?
2011-03-14T08:39:49  <simonstewart> You've not really given us any information to replicate the problem
2011-03-14T08:41:00  <Kn|t3> i told i am new, i would give any and every information
2011-03-14T08:41:15  <Kn|t3> i generated a sample html script that just searched hello on google
2011-03-14T08:41:30  <simonstewart> It'd be useful to know which OS you're on, which browser (and version of browser) you're using and which version of selenium you're on
2011-03-14T08:41:37  <Kn|t3> I am on MacOSX
2011-03-14T08:41:39  <Kn|t3> and using firefox
2011-03-14T08:41:48  <Kn|t3> 3.6.13
2011-03-14T08:42:00  <simonstewart> And which version of selenium?
2011-03-14T08:42:06  <Kn|t3> selenium server i am using of 2.0b2
2011-03-14T08:42:35  <simonstewart> And does a browser appear at all?
2011-03-14T08:42:42  <Kn|t3> 21:11:51.440 INFO - Preparing Firefox profile...

2011-03-14T08:42:58  <simonstewart> Where is Firefox installed?
2011-03-14T08:43:12  <Kn|t3> yeah it does come up
2011-03-14T08:43:20  <Kn|t3> it is the default installation i guess
2011-03-14T08:43:24  <Kn|t3> firefox does open up
2011-03-14T08:43:30  <Kn|t3> so i guess that is not the problem
2011-03-14T08:44:12  <simonstewart> So you've got two windows open?
2011-03-14T08:44:21  <simonstewart> One with three frames and one that's blank?
2011-03-14T08:44:43  <Kn|t3> the other one is not blank
2011-03-14T08:44:53  <simonstewart> It's the google home page?
2011-03-14T08:45:19  <Kn|t3> nopes, it is the selenium page almost similar to the other window
2011-03-14T08:45:28  <simonstewart> ?
2011-03-14T08:45:33  <simonstewart> I don't understand
2011-03-14T08:45:56  <Kn|t3> so there is one page, that shows test suit, current suite and control panel
2011-03-14T08:46:28  <Kn|t3> the control panel has details that says 0 test executed
2011-03-14T08:46:33  <simonstewart> Right.
2011-03-14T08:46:38  <simonstewart> And there should be a second window too
2011-03-14T08:46:44  <Kn|t3> the other window has got these same three strings
2011-03-14T08:46:55  <simonstewart> OK
2011-03-14T08:46:56  <Kn|t3> test suite, current test control panel
2011-03-14T08:47:00  <Kn|t3> but nothing else
2011-03-14T08:47:00  <simonstewart> So selenium's started properly
2011-03-14T08:47:16  <simonstewart> So in your script you've got something like:
2011-03-14T08:47:34  <simonstewart> selenium = new DefaultSelenium("localhost", 4444, "*firefox", "http://www.google.com");
2011-03-14T08:47:40  <simonstewart> selenium.start();
2011-03-14T08:47:47  <simonstewart> There should be a line that says
2011-03-14T08:47:52  <simonstewart> selenium.open("/")
2011-03-14T08:47:55  <simonstewart> (or something similar)
2011-03-14T08:48:09  <Kn|t3> oh no no, i am using the command line to start the server
2011-03-14T08:48:16  <Kn|t3> with parameters
2011-03-14T08:48:25  <Kn|t3> java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.0b2.jar -multiwindow -htmlSuite "*firefox" http://www.google.com  ~/Pictures/Home/WT ~/tmp/result.html
2011-03-14T08:48:35  <simonstewart> OK
2011-03-14T08:48:44  <simonstewart> This is the sort of information that would be useful to know
2011-03-14T08:48:48  <Kn|t3> it is not necessary to use the java thing, rite?
2011-03-14T08:49:06  <simonstewart> The problem there is that you need to put the path to the test file in quotes
2011-03-14T08:49:10  <Kn|t3> oh nice :) I am sorry for the delay
2011-03-14T08:49:11  <simonstewart> It looks like it has a space in it
2011-03-14T08:49:11  <Kn|t3> oh
2011-03-14T08:49:19  <Kn|t3> there is no space in it
2011-03-14T08:49:39  <simonstewart> I'm not sure what's going on then
2011-03-14T08:50:13  <Kn|t3> should it help if i try using java?
2011-03-14T08:50:48  <simonstewart> What you've got should be working. I think
2011-03-14T08:50:51  <simonstewart> Without knowing more
2011-03-14T08:50:59  <Kn|t3> and one more thing, can i run all this remotely? so that i can start it tonight and let it run for the full night?
2011-03-14T08:51:04  <Kn|t3> the other machine might not have firefox on it
2011-03-14T08:51:24  <Kn|t3> is it possible
2011-03-14T08:51:25  <Kn|t3> ??
2011-03-14T08:51:39  <simonstewart> Have you read the docs? http://seleniumhq.org/docs/05_selenium_rc.html
2011-03-14T08:51:55  <Kn|t3> not very carefully
2011-03-14T08:52:04  <Kn|t3> i m sorry abt that
2011-03-14T08:52:07  <simonstewart> No worries
2011-03-14T08:52:08  <Kn|t3> i think i shud do that
2011-03-14T08:52:14  <simonstewart> Sometimes people don't realize it's there
2011-03-14T08:52:22  <Kn|t3> oh .. i did see it was there
2011-03-14T08:52:28  <simonstewart> :)
2011-03-14T08:52:32  <Kn|t3> but i thot that it was easy to run the script by firefox plugin
2011-03-14T08:52:39  <Kn|t3> so i thot it wud be same with the server thingy
2011-03-14T08:52:51  <simonstewart> I think you're doing the Right Thing
2011-03-14T08:53:06  <Kn|t3> even i think so, but I am not able to get it work :(

2011-03-14T09:00:23  <Kn|t3> 3.6.13
2011-03-14T09:00:28  <Kn|t3> simonstewart: thanks
2011-03-14T09:00:34  <antlong> Kn|t3, where is your firefox installed to
2011-03-14T09:01:06  <Kn|t3> i think it is at /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin
2011-03-14T09:01:22  <Kn|t3> but does it matter? the selenium server is able to bring up firefox
2011-03-14T09:01:26  <Kn|t3> and it shows two windows
2011-03-14T09:01:31  <Kn|t3> but it doesnt execute the test
2011-03-14T09:01:34  <antlong> Kn|t3, is your test saved as a 'test case' or a test suite
2011-03-14T09:01:48  <Kn|t3> i tried both
2011-03-14T09:02:05  <Kn|t3> rite now i am running it as test case
2011-03-14T09:04:07  <Kn|t3> i can run it from the firefox plugin though, i dont know why i cannot run it by command line using standalone server

2011-03-14T09:12:57  <Kn|t3> with docs it looks like it is not possible,
2011-03-14T09:13:02  <Kn|t3> just want to confirm

2011-03-14T11:03:32  <bkuhn> simonstewart: Hey!  So I just sent you an email trying to refresh the SoC 2010 thread from last year.  I have been pinging on it a lot, but now it's urgent, as I'll finish up the invoice this week for Soc 2010 and I assume you'd like the money Selenium is owed by Google for SoC 2010 to go into your account at Conservancy.
2011-03-14T11:03:52  <bkuhn> If you can get me an answer by tomorrow morning my time zone, I'd much appreciate it.  Or, at least give me an ETA of when you think you can get me an answer.
2011-03-14T11:04:01  <simonstewart> I think Grace was the contact. Will call Jason and try and get the details for you
2011-03-14T11:04:02  <bkuhn> The information should be easy to find; whoever was org-admin for SoC 2010 should have it.
2011-03-14T11:04:07  <bkuhn> simonstewart: thanks very much.
2011-03-14T11:04:12  <simonstewart> No worries
2011-03-14T11:04:20  <bkuhn> If you can give me an update that's in my email tomorrow morning, regardless of the status, I'd much appreciate.
2011-03-14T11:04:30  <simonstewart> Will do
2011-03-14T11:04:32  <bkuhn> thanks!

2011-03-14T11:39:45  <antlong> hello
2011-03-14T11:40:25  <JohnRandom> I just started using selenium 2 with python and have some difficulties finding good API documentation
2011-03-14T11:41:25  *** Fyrespray^ has joined #selenium
2011-03-14T11:41:55  <JohnRandom> I wrote some tests which pass in firefox, but fail in chrome ... I think it's because chrome doesn't wait for the page before asserting the presence of elements
2011-03-14T11:42:24  <JohnRandom> is there any way to use selenium.waitForPageLoad() in selenium 2 without using the selenium 1 API?
2011-03-14T11:44:09  *** dhackner has quit IRC
2011-03-14T11:44:25  *** Fyrespray has quit IRC
2011-03-14T11:49:23  <jimevans> JohnRandom: In the Selenium 2 API, the pattern is to execute a findElement(), and catch the ensuing NoSuchElementException if the element isn't found.
2011-03-14T11:50:01  <jimevans> note that I'm not a Python programmer, so I'm not sure what the Python-specific idiom is.
2011-03-14T11:50:50  *** stephendonner has left #selenium
2011-03-14T11:51:34  <JohnRandom> jimevans: my problem is, that findElement() fails in chrome while it works in firefix, I am assuming that it fails because chrome doesn't wait for the page to be loaded
2011-03-14T11:52:22  <jimevans> Right. Still not seeing a problem. You perform the findElement in a loop until the element is found or there is a timeout.
2011-03-14T11:52:53  <jimevans> catching the NoSuchElementException in the loop body.
2011-03-14T11:53:06  <JohnRandom> jimevans: hm I could do that ... thanks
2011-03-14T11:53:53  <jimevans> You also might want to investigate the implicit wait functionality. It does the try-catch-until-timeout thing automatically.
2011-03-14T11:53:54  <keturn> ew.  I mean, that's easy enough to do, but it was a very useful abstraction so I hope it finds its way back in to the api (even if just the python-side API)
2011-03-14T11:54:18  <jimevans> (assuming python implements implicit waits, which I think it does)
2011-03-14T11:55:07  <jimevans> In .NET, setting implicit waits is done like so: driver.Manage().Timeouts.ImplicitlyWait(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
2011-03-14T11:57:08  <jimevans> Java is similar.

2011-03-14T13:57:24  <antlong> whats the consesus on the word, locator vs selector, in terms of css? is css selector better than css locator?
2011-03-14T13:58:13  <simonstewart> selector is more "speccy"
2011-03-14T13:58:26  <ato> http://www.google.com/trends?q=%22css+selector%22%2C+%22css+locator%22
2011-03-14T13:58:52  <antlong> ato, very interesting, thanks
2011-03-14T13:59:05  <antlong> i think of locator being an xpath term myself
2011-03-14T13:59:12  <ato> I think one uses :selector in early Watir implementations.
2011-03-14T13:59:37  <ato> We had a long debate about the word “selectors” some time ago, and reached consensus that it was better to just use “css” as a keyword.
2011-03-14T13:59:42  <ato> But that was us, of course.
2011-03-14T13:59:53  <antlong> whos us btw

2011-03-14T14:01:38  <simonstewart> ato: are any of the opera chaps following the standardization work?
2011-03-14T14:01:47  <ato> Anyways, I had to implement foo(:selector, 'css code here') for backwards compliancy last week.  We currently use foo(:css => 'css') instead.

2011-03-14T14:04:37  <simonstewart> Given Opera's lead so far, it'd be great if they joined in the fun too :)
2011-03-14T14:05:24  <ato> I read the email, but what's wrong with the current API?
2011-03-14T14:06:07  <simonstewart> The API is fine (I think), but where it's implemented isn't
2011-03-14T14:06:27  <ato> Where?
2011-03-14T14:06:45  <simonstewart> A majority of the implementations are written by the selenium project
2011-03-14T14:06:50  <simonstewart> That's fine up to a point
2011-03-14T14:06:51  <ato> I mean, I'm obviously no Java man, but I have no problem working with it.
2011-03-14T14:07:09  <simonstewart> but as the number of browsers and OS combinations increase it becomes increasingly hard to keep up
2011-03-14T14:07:27  <simonstewart> worse, if a browser's not got good support for a well-known API it tends not to be tested
2011-03-14T14:07:36  <simonstewart> Which makes testers unhappy
2011-03-14T14:07:40  <simonstewart> the web a worse place
2011-03-14T14:07:52  <simonstewart> And makes everyone's lives a little harder
2011-03-14T14:08:14  <ato> We do have quite a few proprietary methods in addition to the standard API provided by Selenium, but do you have any specific idea for how to handle this in mind?
2011-03-14T14:08:15  <simonstewart> The end-goal is that if a new browser comes out, it should be really easy to add it to an existing test suite
2011-03-14T14:08:23  <simonstewart> Yup :)
2011-03-14T14:08:29  <ato> I remember jarib suggested for Watir APIs that we might use proprietary domains.
2011-03-14T14:08:40  <ato> Like browser.vendor.interface.method.
2011-03-14T14:08:41  <simonstewart> It's something that lots of people want
2011-03-14T14:08:54  <simonstewart> Something like that, yes

2011-03-14T14:09:21  <simonstewart> Versioning is another interesting challenge
2011-03-14T14:09:42  <ato> Hm, indeed.
2011-03-14T14:09:48  <simonstewart> One of the reasons for starting the conversations now is to invite people to contribute ideas
2011-03-14T14:10:04  <simonstewart> Frankly, I'm not too fussed what the standard is, but there really should be one.
2011-03-14T14:10:34  <antlong> simonstewart, in the doc strings im writing, i have a usage part, does it make sense to make the example, driver.command() or command()
2011-03-14T14:10:36  <ato> I've intentionally not gotten myself involved with the deeper ongoings of Selenium or the API thus far, because I wanted to focus on things from the user's point of view, and in our case that has been from the Ruby side.
2011-03-14T14:11:07  <ato> But I do see your point about specification.  One of the big goals I have is to actually reach consensus in the Watir community on what Watir 1, 2 and 3 really is.
2011-03-14T14:11:08  <simonstewart> ato: well, it'd be great to have Opera be involved.
2011-03-14T14:11:17  <simonstewart> antlong: driver.command()
2011-03-14T14:11:34  <simonstewart> I'm always available for a skype call if that'd help
2011-03-14T14:11:58  <ato> The problem is only that I'm not really working on driver, and I'm going to be reassigned to work on other internal systems in the future.
2011-03-14T14:12:02  * ato hates working for a big company.
2011-03-14T14:12:24  <simonstewart> That's another reason why implementing this as a standard would help
2011-03-14T14:12:26  <ato> But yes.  I'd be more than interested to discuss this with you in SF.

2011-03-14T14:20:54  *** fuzzygroove has left #selenium
2011-03-14T14:20:54  <simonstewart> The wire protocol's the best thing to look at
2011-03-14T14:21:00  <simonstewart> the atoms are useful for implementors
2011-03-14T14:21:32  <simonstewart> I can walk you through them any time
2011-03-14T14:22:13  <ato> Thanks, that might be very useful
2011-03-14T14:22:30  <jarib> would be useful to have operadriver as part of the remote server
2011-03-14T14:22:51  <simonstewart> jarib: it's pretty easy to do
2011-03-14T14:23:01  <simonstewart> Have you seen the magic "addConfig" call?
2011-03-14T14:23:05  * ato nods

2011-03-14T14:23:23  <ato> But actually.
2011-03-14T14:23:27  <jarib> aha
2011-03-14T14:23:46  <ato> simonstewart: What worries me a bit here is the proprietary additional methods and constructors we've added.
2011-03-14T14:23:51  <antlong> hmn, does anyone know if switchToFrame takes an index as an int or a string, or does it not matter
2011-03-14T14:23:58  <simonstewart> int
2011-03-14T14:24:01  <antlong> thanks
2011-03-14T14:24:03  <simonstewart> np
2011-03-14T14:24:16  <simonstewart> We've dealt with that here at google
2011-03-14T14:24:26  <simonstewart> addConfig is the thing we're using
2011-03-14T14:24:51  <simonstewart> It boils down to a call on a no-arg constructor or (in preference) a constructor that takes a Capabilities
2011-03-14T14:25:39  <ato> Where Capabilities defines what functionality is present?
2011-03-14T14:25:45  <simonstewart> Right
2011-03-14T14:26:25  <simonstewart> When they're passed to a constructor, they're a request that get fuzzily matched
2011-03-14T14:26:46  <simonstewart> When they're requested from a concrete implementation, they describe the functionality that's present
2011-03-14T14:27:32  *** admc has joined #selenium
2011-03-14T14:27:37  <simonstewart> So the server-side fullfills as many of the desired capabilities as possible
2011-03-14T14:27:59  <simonstewart> So it's perfectly legal to ask for "IE on Linux"
2011-03-14T14:28:13  <simonstewart> But the returned browser will most likely be "IE on Windows"
2011-03-14T14:29:11  <ato> Hm… I'm not sure if I got that completely, but I'll have a look at it when I'm more sober and it's not 11 pm.
2011-03-14T14:29:21  <simonstewart> 11pm is a fine time to not be sober
2011-03-14T14:29:32  <ato> Of course.
2011-03-14T14:29:48  <ato> It does sound like this involves a lot of heuristics, though.

2011-03-14T15:47:17  <nirvdrum> simonstewart: Make your way out to Cambridge yet?  Or are you still in NYC?
2011-03-14T15:47:35  <simonstewart> Not yet
2011-03-14T15:47:39  <simonstewart> Still in NYC
2011-03-14T15:47:46  <nirvdrum> Apparently Adam's in town, too.
2011-03-14T15:47:49  <simonstewart> I may have fouled up the timings for getting to Cambridge
2011-03-14T15:47:54  <simonstewart> adamgoucher?
2011-03-14T15:47:57  <nirvdrum> Yeah.
2011-03-14T15:48:01  <simonstewart> Interesting
2011-03-14T15:48:21  <simonstewart> Are you coming along on Wednesday?
2011-03-14T15:48:42  <nirvdrum> I'm not sure when he heads back.  But he's heading to the Boston Selenium Group meetup tomorrow,
2011-03-14T15:48:49  <nirvdrum> What meeting? :-)

2011-03-14T15:52:52  <nirvdrum> Ahh.  I did hear about that.  Traveling is a little rough right now.  I screwed up my knee pretty badly and have physical therapy on Thurs.
2011-03-14T15:54:35  <simonstewart> Ouch
2011-03-14T15:54:46  <simonstewart> Hope that the therapy helps
