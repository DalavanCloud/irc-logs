2011-04-08T00:02:08  <mashiara> hi, I'm trying to use webdriver (remote execution) with python and get WebDriverException when trying to add_cookie (this is done before first driver.get(), in case it matters)
2011-04-08T00:03:24  <mashiara> also: is there a way to specify the domain for the cookies ? my problem is that I need to set sessions cookies before opening the URL
2011-04-08T00:04:03  *** plightbo has joined #selenium
2011-04-08T00:04:24  <mashiara> doing a get() before add_cookie makes no difference, I get the exception anyway. is there a way to see the actual response from the remote webdriver ?

2011-04-08T00:11:11  <mashiara> gah, the fsckin documentation is wrong for add_cookie, let's try again with a more correct looking cookie_dict...
2011-04-08T00:12:37  <jarib> plightbo: regret i didn't get to say hi at the conference, great talk
2011-04-08T00:12:45  <mashiara> or at least get_cookies returns a wholly different looking list of dictionaries
2011-04-08T00:16:00  <mashiara> nope, changin the format of cookie_dict didn't help
2011-04-08T00:20:00  <plantian> mashiara: I know this sounds terrible but I just call the login url with some login info and then call the url that requires that the user is logged in.
2011-04-08T00:20:21  <plantian> I just started using selenium two days ago though so that's all I know pretty much.
2011-04-08T00:21:16  <mashiara> I'm back to looking at selenium after two years or so, the webdriver looks much nicer than the old api
2011-04-08T00:21:45  <plantian> Yeah I never used it before, I'm using it from python too.
2011-04-08T00:21:46  <mashiara> but seems to be a bit flaky at time. fact remains I really need to be able to set the session cookies
2011-04-08T00:22:23  *** Fyrespray^ has joined #selenium
2011-04-08T00:22:55  <mashiara> or of course there's always a workaround or two but setting the cookies will save a lot of time when running the tests
2011-04-08T00:23:33  <mashiara> since each test doesn't have to go through the whole login thing before it can do what it was actually supposed to do

2011-04-08T00:34:48  <plantian> mashiara: Oh I'm using it locally with the binary.
2011-04-08T00:34:57  <plantian> I watch each test login, ha.
2011-04-08T00:35:50  <mashiara> running locally gets me a much more sane error message :) "WebDriverException: You may only set cookies for the current domain"
2011-04-08T00:36:22  <mashiara> I wonder what is considered current domain if I haven get() anything yet...
2011-04-08T00:38:08  <mashiara> if trying to set a cookie before a get I get error: WebDriverException: Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMLocation.host]
2011-04-08T00:44:58  <jarib> mashiara: you need to navigate to the domain you want to add the cookie to.
2011-04-08T00:45:38  * jarib calls it a day
2011-04-08T00:45:50  <mashiara> jarib thanks, any way around it ?
2011-04-08T00:45:57  <jarib> no
2011-04-08T00:46:04  <mashiara> since the whole domain is behind shibboleth
2011-04-08T00:46:22  <jarib> sorry, webdriver will only let you set cookies on the current domain
2011-04-08T00:46:24  <jarib> good night!
2011-04-08T00:49:55  <mashiara> ha, I can call domain/Shibboleth.sso/ (it will return error 500, but selenium won't choke on that yet) and *then* set my cookies...
2011-04-08T00:50:24  <mashiara> and since that's shibboleths own magic url it won't trap the request...

2011-04-08T04:21:35  <mashiara> does someone know how *exactly* webdriver.get() handles redirects ? I know it follows them but does the method return after the first response or will it wait until redirections have completed (for the moment supposing the redirect is done on server level returning 302/301)

2011-04-08T04:36:51  <mashiara> ok, thanks. what if we have a javascript form submit done at document.ready() ? (Shibboleth handles logins "interestingly")
2011-04-08T04:37:27  <mashiara> I'd suppose get() returns once page has loaded and then I need to wait for the javascript submit ?
2011-04-08T04:37:58  <mashiara> and after the submit wait for the next page to load and then I can continue my test

2011-04-08T06:09:21  <mashiara> just checking (suing webdriver via python): if I have gotten element = self.driver.find_element_by_whatever() then element.find_element_by_xpath() I need to specify the path starting from said element and not from root of the document ?
2011-04-08T06:11:31  <tyrion-mx> css ftw
2011-04-08T06:14:15  <mashiara> yes but for some reason I get 'invalid string' (or something) when I try to use the more advanced CSS selectors
2011-04-08T06:14:40  <mashiara> I'll doublecheck the exception from css later, right now I just want to get this one test working.
2011-04-08T06:20:04  <mashiara> find_element_by_css_selector('li:nth(2) > a') throws: WebDriverException: An invalid or illegal string was specified
2011-04-08T06:21:19  <mashiara> ditto for ul.find_element_by_css_selector('a[href*=/midcom-logout-]')
2011-04-08T06:21:40  <mashiara> ul.find_element_by_xpath('li[2]/a') works fine.
2011-04-08T06:21:59  <mashiara> and ul is something I have gotten via CSS selector earlier
2011-04-08T06:22:55  <mashiara> I must say I like the webdriver+python approach, but the CSS selectors behaving erratically is more than a bit annoying (especially since I'm used to jQuery)
2011-04-08T06:23:15  <mashiara> or maybe I have a brainfart somewhere

2011-04-08T11:38:25  <santiycr> yesterday I ended bringing up the 3 nodes in our bamboo CI system
2011-04-08T11:38:37  <santiycr> I set them up to be able to run the python tests
2011-04-08T11:38:55  <santiycr> upgraded both the XP both and the mac one
2011-04-08T11:39:15  <santiycr> tests sometimes get stuck though

2011-04-08T14:00:18  <krosenvold> The thing is, immaturity in CI systems tend to cost you a *lot* of time
2011-04-08T14:00:53  <krosenvold> If webdriver's tests hang, that can't really be blamed on bamboo, I think
2011-04-08T14:01:32  <santiycr> well, I've noticed bamboo will not kill the build after over 10 hours of them running
2011-04-08T14:01:41  <santiycr> even though I did my best to configure it to do that
2011-04-08T14:02:14  <santiycr> so, if I didn't configure correctly, that means that the tool is not usable enough for a reasonable skilled person to make it do what's expected
2011-04-08T14:02:37  <santiycr> OTOH, if I did configure correctly, that means it's broken, which is even worse
2011-04-08T14:02:37  <krosenvold> Interesting; bamboo used to be able to kill processes well
2011-04-08T14:02:52  <krosenvold> It's probably a bug, I'll as i386

2011-04-08T14:03:32  <krosenvold> It's bamboo 3.x right ?
2011-04-08T14:04:21  * krosenvold thinks its 2.7
2011-04-08T14:05:08  <krosenvold> Well anyway, timeout used to work well. BUt this stuff is jus software ;)
2011-04-08T14:05:43  <santiycr> yeah, it's 2.7
2011-04-08T14:06:08  <santiycr> of course, that's sometimes acceptable
2011-04-08T14:06:28  <santiycr> but having used jenkins for a long time, I'm way more inclined to that
2011-04-08T14:06:38  <santiycr> plus the fact that it's open source software
2011-04-08T14:06:58  * krosenvold thinks jenkins is a big pile of crap. Pardon the french
