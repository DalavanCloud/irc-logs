2011-08-09T03:46:53  <simonstewart> (rake, to be precise)
2011-08-09T03:47:14  <AutomatedTester> ok, then plain rake can't create a directory when the top level parts exist?
2011-08-09T03:48:20  <AutomatedTester> i want to create a directory win32 in py/selenium/webdriver/ie but it says it exists when it clearly doesnt
2011-08-09T03:48:38  <simonstewart> Why create that at build time?
2011-08-09T03:49:01  <AutomatedTester> because it gets created then I call the python setup stuff
2011-08-09T03:49:13  <Ajay> can anybody tell how the screenshot functionality works , where do i get the data from ? , i was thinking of some enhancements
2011-08-09T03:49:28  <AutomatedTester> that way I keep relative paths in the egg and the world is a better place
2011-08-09T03:49:58  <simonstewart> But that directory _does_ exist

2011-08-09T03:52:11  <simonstewart> Not bad.

2011-08-09T03:53:34  <simonstewart> It's a little odd to build that in the main source tree though
2011-08-09T03:53:41  <simonstewart> surely you want "build/py/...."
2011-08-09T03:53:44  <simonstewart> ?
2011-08-09T03:54:37  <AutomatedTester> since I am not building except for the xpi and the dll it should be fine

2011-08-09T05:41:11  <Binken_> I am thinking that the click action may changed after the rc2
2011-08-09T05:41:22  <Binken_> #2222

2011-08-09T05:42:20  <jimevans> I'm sure the click action did change since RC2. I know there was a change to handle select elements differently, so yes, it's changed.
2011-08-09T05:42:58  <Binken_> Do you think this will effect the link click <a></a>
2011-08-09T05:43:18  <jimevans> i sincerely doubt it.
2011-08-09T05:44:35  <Binken_> Anyway, I am still trying to reproduce it
2011-08-09T05:44:57  <jimevans> clicking a link involves sending windows messages to the browser window at the appropriate set of coordinates. this approach hasn't changed in over a year.
2011-08-09T05:46:02  <jimevans> it's far more likely that the calculation of where to click the link is incorrect, and the IE driver is clicking in the wrong place.
2011-08-09T05:46:31  <jimevans> that's why we say you have to have the browser zoom level set to 100% for the IE driver to work properly.
2011-08-09T05:47:09  <Binken_> I think in my situation, It may click the wrong place
2011-08-09T05:47:13  <jimevans> websites with frames are particularly vulnerable to this kind of miscalculation.
2011-08-09T05:49:58  <Binken_> How does the IEDriver to calculate the coordinates?
2011-08-09T05:50:47  <jimevans> does your website have frames?
2011-08-09T05:50:53  <Binken_> No
2011-08-09T05:50:58  <jimevans> then it shouldn't matter.
2011-08-09T05:51:19  *** selbot2 has quit IRC
2011-08-09T05:51:20  <jimevans> we get the rectangle describing the control by calling getBoundingClientRect() on the elemtn

2011-08-09T05:51:29  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-08-09T05:51:42  <jimevans> then we click in the middle of that rectangle.
2011-08-09T05:52:05  <Binken_> aha, that's maybe the issue .
2011-08-09T05:52:35  <jimevans> this, incidentally, is why we have difficulty clicking on links that wrap lines.

2011-08-09T05:53:53  <simonstewart> jimevans: I've been thinking

2011-08-09T05:54:04  * jimevans ducks
2011-08-09T05:54:08  <simonstewart> For links, should we think about grabbing the first client rect rather than the bounding client rect?
2011-08-09T05:55:16  <Binken_> Understand, The <a></a> text in our production (in IE6) is splited into there pieces. And look like three li. And the blank area can not be clicked
2011-08-09T05:55:19  <jimevans> possibly. if that would give us a reliable click point that's actually on the link, it's probably a good idea.
2011-08-09T05:55:37  <Binken_> So maybe the IEDriver is clicked the blank area
2011-08-09T05:55:45  <simonstewart> Binken_: that's a useful nugget of information
2011-08-09T05:55:52  <simonstewart> Almost definitely that's what's happening
2011-08-09T05:56:58  <jimevans> and the rendering differences between versions of IE would likely explain why you're only seeing it in IE6
2011-08-09T05:57:07  <Binken_> YES
2011-08-09T05:57:30  <Binken_> Only in IE6 the link is splited and have some blank area that can not be clicked
2011-08-09T05:57:52  <Binken_> In the other browsers, the whole area is clickable

2011-08-09T06:08:42  <simonstewart> Yup
2011-08-09T06:08:46  <Binken_> I have pictured the img to you
2011-08-09T06:08:54  <jimevans> i see it.
2011-08-09T06:09:10  <Binken_> only the text is clickable
2011-08-09T06:09:14  <Gungy> so why then have you directed me to the downloads page - this is just a list of various downloads
2011-08-09T06:09:36  <jimevans> Binken_: and it's a single <a> element?
2011-08-09T06:09:40  <Binken_> But the three line is one <a></a>
2011-08-09T06:09:43  <Binken_> Yes
2011-08-09T06:10:21  <Binken_> https://gist.github.com/1133883
2011-08-09T06:10:39  <jimevans> yep. it's clicking in the wrong place. In your screenshot, I'd expect it to click somewhere in the second line, but to the right of the text, which would be the center of the rectangle described by the <a> element.
2011-08-09T06:11:42  <Binken_> aha, so it click somewhere is not clickable in IE6
2011-08-09T06:11:49  <dawagner> jimevans: Is there anything special that needs configuring to get WinXP IE6 tests running?
2011-08-09T06:12:01  <jimevans> i'm speculating, but that's a pretty good guess.
2011-08-09T06:12:28  <jimevans> dawagner: not especially. there's no protected mode or anything, so you should be good out of the box.
2011-08-09T06:13:18  <Binken_> Jim, does the click option will fire the onchange event in IE6?
2011-08-09T06:13:38  <dawagner> hmm ok - they seem to be running, but fell over at testUploadingFileShouldFireOnChangeEvent
2011-08-09T06:14:27  <dawagner> Strange
2011-08-09T06:14:28  <jimevans> Binken_: for what type of element?
2011-08-09T06:14:34  <dawagner> Clicking on the body tag is complaining that it's not visible :S
2011-08-09T06:14:38  <Binken_> in the dropdown
2011-08-09T06:15:02  <jimevans> dawagner: yep. i've seen that. we should probably change the test to change focus to an actual other element.
2011-08-09T06:15:15  <jimevans> Binken_: unless it's a jquery dropdown, then yes, it does.
2011-08-09T06:15:45  *** adamgoucher has joined #selenium
2011-08-09T06:16:16  <Binken_> what's difference between the JQuery dropdown and the normal one?
2011-08-09T06:16:44  <jimevans> jquery's "change" event doesn't fire when you fire the HTML onchange event of a <select> element.
2011-08-09T06:17:15  <jimevans> in 2.3.0, it should work, even with jquery elements. in trunk, it's currently broken.
2011-08-09T06:17:27  <jimevans> sorry, let me amend that.
2011-08-09T06:17:55  <jimevans> i think it works in 2.3.0, but i've heard reports that it doesn't in some cases.
2011-08-09T06:18:10  <Binken_> IE6 fails, I think

2011-08-09T06:20:54  <jimevans> we used to manually fire the onchange event in the click command handler in the IE driver, but that didn't work for jquery select elements.
2011-08-09T06:21:04  <simonstewart> fricking jquery
2011-08-09T06:21:14  <jimevans> we moved to using the click automation atom, and that seemed to fix it in at least some scenarios.

2011-08-09T06:22:52  <Binken_> Jim, have you saw this?
2011-08-09T06:23:01  <jimevans> i guess we need to create a test case for clicking on jquery dropdown elements for the atoms.
2011-08-09T06:23:15  <simonstewart> agreed
2011-08-09T06:23:22  <Binken_> Yes
2011-08-09T06:23:34  <jimevans> i have seen it.
2011-08-09T06:23:41  <Binken_> Any tests for sendkeys with tab and enter?

2011-08-09T06:26:07  <jimevans> there are some tests that test those keystrokes, yes.
2011-08-09T06:26:19  <jimevans> with jquery elements? i don't think so.
2011-08-09T06:26:39  <jimevans> brb
2011-08-09T06:26:53  <Binken_> I think the sendkeys with tab and enter doesnot work in the 2.3.0 #2077

2011-08-09T06:48:10  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: are the python bindings okay to release?
2011-08-09T06:48:15  <dawagner> Why the hell does IE7 block javascript prompts by default?
2011-08-09T06:48:25  <dawagner> Not alerts, not confirms
2011-08-09T06:48:27  <dawagner> Just prompts

2011-08-09T06:49:09  <simonstewart> will do
2011-08-09T06:49:21  <jimevans> it breaks on ie9 for sure.
2011-08-09T06:49:37  <simonstewart> And there are failures in our tests?
2011-08-09T06:49:58  <jimevans> ElementSelectingTest.testShouldBeAbleToToggleEnableMultiSelectOption is one.
2011-08-09T06:50:07  <simonstewart> Great. Will look into it now
2011-08-09T06:50:13  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: yea, I can revert what I am doing to do the release
2011-08-09T06:50:22  <simonstewart> what are you doing to the release?
2011-08-09T06:50:42  <AutomatedTester> i wanted to add x64 IE support to python
2011-08-09T06:50:43  <jimevans> dawagner: yeah, forgot about that one. ie blocks prompts.
2011-08-09T06:50:55  <simonstewart> How long will it take?
2011-08-09T06:51:06  * jimevans should really check the registry for that one.
2011-08-09T06:51:17  <AutomatedTester> a while because I can't get it to create a folder, then I need to test
2011-08-09T06:51:26  <simonstewart> ok.
2011-08-09T06:51:36  <AutomatedTester> so going to have to redo the entire python build process
2011-08-09T06:51:44  <simonstewart> You've got until I fix this select not firing change events test problem :)
2011-08-09T06:51:54  <simonstewart> redo the entire process?
2011-08-09T06:51:59  <simonstewart> Seems a little dramatic
2011-08-09T06:51:59  <jimevans> general question: if you wanted to force a single <a> element to break on multiple lines, where the first line is right-aligned, how would *you* do it?
2011-08-09T06:52:20  <AutomatedTester> well currently I use the normal python approach and just take from the root

2011-08-09T07:48:17  <simonstewart> Interesting. The pure JS test passes in IE9
2011-08-09T07:48:24  <lord1234> is there any way to do that then?
2011-08-09T07:48:25  <jimevans> you can find_element() and catch the exception if it doesn't exist, or find_elements() and check for size == 0 of the returned array.
2011-08-09T07:48:48  <jimevans> simonstewart: that *is* interesting.

2011-08-09T07:54:53  <AutomatedTester> s/like/live
2011-08-09T07:55:56  <jimevans> in case you're wondering what the logic should look like for fixing the FF driver, it goes like this:
2011-08-09T07:56:50  <lord1234> jimevans:  is there table handling in webdriver?
2011-08-09T07:56:56  <AutomatedTester> yay!
2011-08-09T07:56:56  <jimevans> if (elementIsAnchor && element.getClientRects().length > 1) rect = element.getClientRects()[0] else rect = element.getBoundingClientRect()
2011-08-09T07:57:22  <jimevans> lord1234: explicit table handling as a special element type? no.
2011-08-09T07:57:33  <lord1234> i mean similarly to how RC has get_table
2011-08-09T07:57:57  <jimevans> that would be handling tables as a special element type. so no, we don't do anything special for tables.
2011-08-09T07:58:38  <lord1234> so how do you get the values of elements inside a table, if all you know is they are in a table and each in a seperate row?
2011-08-09T07:59:01  <dawagner> I hate it when tests start passing.
2011-08-09T08:00:19  <simonstewart> jimevans: that makes sense
2011-08-09T08:00:20  <jimevans> lord1234: find the table element, then the table row element, then the cells inside the table row.
2011-08-09T08:00:43  <jimevans> lord1234: (note you can probably make that a lot more efficient)
2011-08-09T08:02:29  <XRayCulver> is table.grid-table > tbody > tr:nth-child(1) valid for css with selenium?
2011-08-09T08:03:05  <jimevans> XRayCulver: i don't know. is nth-child() part of the CSS selector standard? if so, what level?
2011-08-09T08:03:10  <lord1234> jim i'm confused when you say I can make it more efficient
2011-08-09T08:03:20  <lord1234> if its able to be made more efficient...why hasn't it been done in the webdriver app?
2011-08-09T08:03:25  <XRayCulver> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#nth-child-pseudo
2011-08-09T08:03:37  <lord1234> switching to webdriver is gonna be a huge royal pain in the ass
2011-08-09T08:03:46  <jimevans> lord1234, you probably can collapse the finds into a single statement, if you know the element you're looking for.
2011-08-09T08:04:06  <simonstewart> dawagner's taking over the weird clicking problem
2011-08-09T08:04:11  <XRayCulver> i found the example 1/2 through that page
2011-08-09T08:04:18  <lord1234> jim: in the psat it was looking for this: oUAI.reportName = $browser.get_table("//html/body/div[1]/div[5]/table/.#{i.to_s}.0")
2011-08-09T08:04:21  <lord1234> because I'm trying to identify the report name
2011-08-09T08:04:41  <lord1234> now its going to be an uglier xpath i fear
2011-08-09T08:04:45  <lord1234> was hoping to avoid that
2011-08-09T08:04:46  <lord1234> ok
2011-08-09T08:05:11  <simonstewart> you don't need to find everything in one go
2011-08-09T08:05:24  <simonstewart> Skip the ugly, and go with the beautiful locators
2011-08-09T08:05:30  <simonstewart> (or the less ugly ones, at least)
2011-08-09T08:05:57  <jimevans> XRayCulver: if the browser supports CSS level 3, WebDriver will find it using that CSS selector.
2011-08-09T08:06:06  <XRayCulver> ie 8/9

2011-08-09T08:08:23  <simonstewart> :P
2011-08-09T08:08:24  <jimevans> here's why:
2011-08-09T08:08:52  <simonstewart> I love it when jimevans explains why IE is doing wonky things
2011-08-09T08:08:52  *** monzie has quit IRC
2011-08-09T08:08:59  <jimevans> IE8 (and 9 in compatibility mode) support querySelectorAll(), so we will try to use the native selector engine for CSS selections.
2011-08-09T08:09:04  <XRayCulver> i love good explainations for anything
2011-08-09T08:09:06  <jimevans> (as opposed to injecting sizzle)
2011-08-09T08:09:21  <jimevans> IE9 supports CSS3 selectors; IE8 does not.
2011-08-09T08:09:26  <XRayCulver> i saw that
2011-08-09T08:09:40  <XRayCulver> should i goto xpath then or something else?
2011-08-09T08:09:40  <plightbo> simonstewart: so yes, I vote for "interactive" on readyState

2011-08-09T08:09:47  <jimevans> So using IE8, we will use the native CSS selector engine, which doesn't support nth-child()
2011-08-09T08:09:49  *** ian_mac_ has quit IRC
2011-08-09T08:09:51  <XRayCulver> and dynamically creating the css
2011-08-09T08:09:59  <XRayCulver> right
2011-08-09T08:10:24  <plightbo> simonstewart: I think it offers the most flexibility to end users and is the least surprising, since it allows me to to simulate what real users do (click on things before images are done loading)
2011-08-09T08:10:34  *** ian_mac_ has joined #selenium
2011-08-09T08:10:42  <plightbo> I will now repeat that on list :)
2011-08-09T08:11:03  <simonstewart> Ahh... the great "get" debate
2011-08-09T08:11:21  <jimevans> XRayCulver: you could use xpath with it's attendant perf issues in IE, which, to be sure, are likely to be minimal in a properly scoped find operation.
2011-08-09T08:11:58  <XRayCulver> its either that or sequencing .FindElement() selectors
2011-08-09T08:12:02  *** sburjan has quit IRC
2011-08-09T08:12:07  <jimevans> you could also find multiple children via CSS selector and iterate yourself.
2011-08-09T08:12:19  <XRayCulver> doh!
2011-08-09T08:12:21  <XRayCulver> yes i can
2011-08-09T08:12:48  <XRayCulver> jimevans: thanks for the insight
2011-08-09T08:13:03  <jimevans> btw, i find http://quirksmode.org a really great resource for figuring out which browser versions support what.
2011-08-09T08:13:39  <plightbo> simonstewart: we just got bit by a related bug in our site last night

2011-08-09T08:14:05  <simonstewart> Heh
2011-08-09T08:14:22  <simonstewart> My worry is that a lot of the comments there are ignoring the common case
2011-08-09T08:14:44  <simonstewart> So we want to make clicking before a page is "loaded" possible
2011-08-09T08:14:52  <simonstewart> But do we want to make it the default case?
2011-08-09T08:15:05  <simonstewart> Probably not, as that'll make most tests look pretty nasty
2011-08-09T08:15:36  <XRayCulver> i'm in that camp
2011-08-09T08:15:44  <XRayCulver> i'd rather for a more stable page ready state
2011-08-09T08:15:45  <plightbo> ok, if you want to make it a non-default option that's fine with me
2011-08-09T08:15:45  *** mates has quit IRC
2011-08-09T08:15:52  <plightbo> just makes the API have more "options", which I thought you wanted to avoid
2011-08-09T08:16:00  <plightbo> but I'm fine with that - I just want the ability to test those cases
2011-08-09T08:16:20  <simonstewart> Well, that's the argument for being able to set the load timeout
2011-08-09T08:17:20  <jimevans> i'm honestly more interested in the frames/iframes case than anything else.
2011-08-09T08:17:36  <simonstewart> jimevans: with loading?
2011-08-09T08:17:41  <jimevans> right now, most drivers wait for frames in a frameset to load on get()
2011-08-09T08:17:48  <simonstewart> Right
2011-08-09T08:18:43  <jimevans> while it would make the wait ie driver a whole lot simpler to not wait for frames, i think people expect a block on get()
2011-08-09T08:18:55  <jimevans> *most people
2011-08-09T08:19:19  <jimevans> though more clearly defining and documenting what that means is a Good Thing.
2011-08-09T08:20:16  <simonstewart> It's thorny
2011-08-09T08:20:32  <simonstewart> What happens if a hidden iframe is used for a long hanging GET?
2011-08-09T08:20:37  <simonstewart> (damn, meeting time)
2011-08-09T08:21:48  <XRayCulver> with xpath, if you root it off of another IWebElement like element.findelement(By.Xpath()), would you preface it with ./, / or //, or does it not matter?
2011-08-09T08:22:24  <jimevans> use ./
2011-08-09T08:22:41  <XRayCulver> thanks again
2011-08-09T08:22:46  <jimevans> there was a big discussion awhile back about whether // in finding children should start at the root of the document.
2011-08-09T08:23:02  <jimevans> i think we came down on the side of "yes, it should, because that's what the xpath spec says"
2011-08-09T08:23:23  <XRayCulver> alright
2011-08-09T08:23:26  <XRayCulver> thats what i was wondering
2011-08-09T08:23:33  <XRayCulver> i wanted to root my xpath at the element
2011-08-09T08:23:47  <jimevans> to be honest, though, i don't remember. './' should be safe though.
2011-08-09T08:24:08  <XRayCulver> hope that gets sorted
2011-08-09T08:24:15  <XRayCulver> seems kind of important
2011-08-09T08:24:31  <jimevans> oh, we sorted it out, i just don't remember what the decision was. :)
2011-08-09T08:24:35  <XRayCulver> hehe

2011-08-09T08:39:24  * AutomatedTester did Jeet Kuen Do in uni...
2011-08-09T08:39:47  <jimevans> no, we probably should be checking the error code. that change to use the click atom was done in a bit of a rush.
2011-08-09T08:40:18  <dawagner> No worries, I'll throw in some error checks as part of working out what's going wrong :)
2011-08-09T08:41:12  <dawagner> Why oh why oh why can't debuggers have consistent keyboard shortcuts?
2011-08-09T08:41:55  <jimevans> dawagner: that would be too easy!
2011-08-09T08:43:00  <AutomatedTester> dawagner: they wouldnt be stretching your brain capacity if they didnt
2011-08-09T08:43:07  <dawagner> :p
2011-08-09T08:43:30  <dawagner> Right, I have a cause of the bug, and I have a meeting
2011-08-09T08:45:02  <jimevans> well, as i learned from g.i. joe, knowing is half the battle.
2011-08-09T08:45:19  <jimevans> (the other half is equally split between red and blue lasers)
2011-08-09T08:46:15  <andytinkham> Anyone have ideas of what to look for when an element is found in IE, but send_keys doesn't seem to actually send anything? (Code works in firefox) The field has a default value of ___-__-____ (it's an SSN field), but stays blank after focus leaves after supposedly setting the value
2011-08-09T08:47:31  <lord1234> so jim, am I right that the check/uncheck functionality is not supported by webdriver?  I'd have to click on the element right?
2011-08-09T08:47:44  <lord1234> andy you're using ruby?
2011-08-09T08:47:50  <andytinkham> lord1234: Yep
2011-08-09T08:47:54  <lord1234> what IDE are you using to code your ruby?
2011-08-09T08:48:05  <andytinkham> Netbeans, but we're not thrilled with it
2011-08-09T08:48:11  <lord1234> i was about to say
2011-08-09T08:48:12  <lord1234> use netbeans
2011-08-09T08:48:15  <lord1234> to track down your issue
2011-08-09T08:48:18  <jimevans> lord1234: yes, click is correct.
2011-08-09T08:49:12  <andytinkham> I know the line of code: "temp.send_keys value.to_s" where temp is the web element (which the log indicates is successfully found). Would Netbeans help in other ways?

2011-08-09T12:44:56  <Parabola> hey hey
2011-08-09T12:45:23  <Parabola> using grid2, i've got hub and a node running, however i'm getting a nullpointer on my .get(URL)
2011-08-09T12:45:44  <Parabola> he browser (ie7) launches on the node, but in the URL bar theres this: http://localhost:12123/
2011-08-09T12:45:59  <Parabola> which is not where im sending it
2011-08-09T12:46:08  <Parabola> or is that port even valid for anything that i've setup. any ideas?
2011-08-09T12:46:43  <jimevans> the ie driver always starts on a localhost:<random port> url. that's because we have to have a valid URL to start IE with, and about:blank doesn't count.
2011-08-09T12:47:29  <Parabola> ah cool
2011-08-09T12:47:30  <jimevans> the port in the url is the port that the language bindings use to communicate with the embedded http server that the ie driver uses.
2011-08-09T12:48:12  <jimevans> you can specify what port that is in most of the language bindings, but I don't know how to do that in Java, and I also don't know if grid affects that at all.
2011-08-09T12:48:23  <Parabola> i dont care to change it
2011-08-09T12:48:27  <Parabola> but driver.get is not working
2011-08-09T12:49:21  <Parabola> http://pastebin.com/p2QavHCs
2011-08-09T12:50:08  <Parabola> am i doing that correctly?
2011-08-09T12:51:04  <jimevans> you don't need to set the browser name when you use DesiredCapabilities.internetExplorer(), but other than that, I think that looks right.
2011-08-09T12:51:22  <jimevans> s/don't need/shouldn't need
2011-08-09T12:52:04  <jimevans> I've not seen NullPointerExceptions when calling get(), but there are some gotchas if you're running on Vista or Windows 7 with IE7 or higher.
2011-08-09T12:52:58  <jimevans> those are documented in the project wiki (http://code.google.com/p/selenium/w/list)
2011-08-09T12:57:51  <Parabola> kk, this is an xp SP3 x86 VM
2011-08-09T12:57:53  <Parabola> with ie7
2011-08-09T12:58:24  <jimevans> alright, since it's XP, none of the configuration issues would apply

2011-08-09T16:43:42  <Benjamin_> Hello
2011-08-09T16:44:33  <Benjamin_> I have a quick question on using selenium webdrive in grails
2011-08-09T16:44:48  <Benjamin_> if anyone has time...
2011-08-09T16:45:32  <sfbrian> Benjamin_: I'm not a big ruby guy but what's your question?
2011-08-09T16:46:52  <Benjamin_> Well okay, so I've got a test to run when I say "grails test-app", but when the firefox 5 browser opens, my page loads but some plugins like "jquery ui performance" doesn't get run. I know it isn't running because I don't see the group of javascript includes that a "p:javascript" tag should produce
2011-08-09T16:47:43  <Benjamin_> So I'm thinking, when I run these tests, somehow there must be some plugin-loading process that gets skipped.
2011-08-09T16:49:38  <Benjamin_> there must be some way to make the true grails app load, just as it would when i say "run-app"
2011-08-09T16:49:52  <Benjamin_> and perform selenium tests on THAT
2011-08-09T16:53:28  <sfbrian> hmm
