2011-07-29T01:52:18  <Gungy> hi has anyone come across the issue of firefox browser staying minimised when executing test case in eclipse?
2011-07-29T01:52:33  <Bebe> how can a see the grid capabilities?
2011-07-29T01:57:10  <eranm> lange, if you're using the Selenium 2 API, you get the screenshot as an object you should serialize to a file.
2011-07-29T02:04:50  <eranm> lange, as you can see from the code, it attaches the screenshot to the exception, when one is thrown.

2011-07-29T04:25:08  <sdimkov> Has anybody run WebDriver in openSUSE linux?  I experience very strange bug when trying to run it and can't replicate the bug in Debian/Mint/Ubuntu/Chakra. It must be something related to the configuration of that distro. When I launch Firefox and call Driver#get() the webpage loads but the method never returns. Eventually a timeout exception is raised.
2011-07-29T04:26:02  <sdimkov> I get this with both the standalone jar and when running FF from ruby bindings directly.

2011-07-29T05:22:17  <jarib> does the page take more than 60 seconds to load?
2011-07-29T05:23:38  <jarib> can you see the page loading? (e.g. "Waiting for ...") in the bottom left
2011-07-29T05:23:42  <sdimkov> I believe its loaded way before that. But there is something strange. The url doesn't get shown on the webpage.
2011-07-29T05:24:04  <sdimkov> which make me thing it's still loading something. but no it doesn't say "lodaing" as normal in the bottom

2011-07-29T05:27:30  <sdimkov> so while I wait , If I go, open 2nd tab and enter something to load, #get() replies miliseconds after.
2011-07-29T05:28:09  <sdimkov> it's like firefox wasn't started properly and webdriver can't get replies from it. Until I manually make FF open something else as well

2011-07-29T06:52:09  <Mayank> Hi, I have a code that clicks on radio buttons and submits it. As the webdriver is clicking on the radio buttons, half the portion of the page is lost (not sure if this is only visibly lost from the browser - IE). The page gets a new form via ajax. The problem is - I cannot click on these new elements with the driver. I am using - driver.findElement(By.id())
2011-07-29T06:52:58  <Mayank> a new form, after the original one is lost submitted.
2011-07-29T06:53:02  <Mayank> simonstewart: ^
2011-07-29T06:54:23  <simonstewart> So you're updating the page using JS?
2011-07-29T06:55:50  <Mayank> simonstewart: yes
2011-07-29T06:56:02  <simonstewart> dawagner: those gists look like the alert's not opened in time
2011-07-29T06:56:18  <dawagner> simonstewart: Yep, time to insert some waits :)
2011-07-29T06:56:27  <simonstewart> Mayank: when you expect the page to update, use Wait<WebDriver> to wait for something that you expect to be new and there
2011-07-29T06:56:43  <sdimkov> jarib: It's the stock version that they ship with openSUSE. (5.0)

2011-07-29T07:00:19  <Mayank> simonstewart: I did try explicit wait, but it waits till it times out, that is - it cannot find the element.
2011-07-29T07:00:32  <simonstewart> Is the page actually updating?

2011-07-29T07:18:09  <dawagner> Native Firefox events are flaky
2011-07-29T07:18:20  <jarib> i thought it was on actual usage since switch_to isn't an RPC call
2011-07-29T07:18:21  <dawagner> Without native events, javascript and java tests passed on all versions

2011-07-29T07:19:04  <dawagner> Yep

The bug arised when detecting an <embed> that is created at once with an id and an src. I've confirmed that preventing the .swf from loading (by using a proxy which blocks the response) removes the problem. I've shown it to a co-worker who said it looks like a race condition to him.

2011-07-29T08:26:24  <simonstewart> the general idea is that you want to synch to "something" before performing your next action
2011-07-29T08:27:35  <XRayCulver> the page object checks that its on the right page?
2011-07-29T08:27:41  <dawagner> Ensuring that when you enter or return from a method, it checks that it is ready to continue.  So before you log in, you check that (or wait until) the log-in box is present.

2011-07-29T09:15:08  <pngl> Does send_keys trigger implicit timeouts? I'm sending a filename to an upload form which autosubmits asynchronously, and somehow I don't get control back until the upload has completed.

2011-07-29T09:31:04  <lord1234> http://code.google.com/p/php-webdriver-bindings/wiki/implemented_methods  is super helpful!
2011-07-29T09:31:08  <XRayCulver> anybody have a good method for working with <select> elements? searching the list for a value?
2011-07-29T09:31:17  <XRayCulver> i have something but it feels clunky
2011-07-29T09:31:58  <XRayCulver> befor i sendkeys to it, i like to check that the value exists
2011-07-29T09:32:27  <lord1234> so then just is_element_present the specific element
2011-07-29T09:32:34  <dawagner> XRayCulver: Which API and language are you using?

2011-07-29T09:33:29  <dawagner> AutomatedTester: I'm aware that it's a problem with the server, and we need to fix that, but this was a quick-fix
2011-07-29T09:33:53  <AutomatedTester> dawagner: my question was why you used @staticmethod
2011-07-29T09:34:10  <dawagner> XRayCulver: Look at the OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI.SelectElement class
2011-07-29T09:34:50  <dawagner> AutomatedTester: Because it is... Is that not the done thing? (I'm new to Python)
2011-07-29T09:35:40  <AutomatedTester> I am not moaning, it was just a question
2011-07-29T09:36:05  <AutomatedTester> its like in Java, would you have made that static?

2011-07-29T10:03:45  <abourget> I'm trying to select some text in a textarea with the Python bindings.. but can't find an API to do that..
2011-07-29T10:03:50  <abourget> Am I missing something ?
2011-07-29T10:06:31  <AutomatedTester> select some text?
2011-07-29T10:10:07  <abourget> yeah, in a textarea or a text input..
2011-07-29T10:10:09  <abourget> is that possible ?
2011-07-29T10:10:35  <AutomatedTester> not really
2011-07-29T10:10:40  <jimevans> abourget: use keystrokes? e.g. ctrl+home, shift+end
2011-07-29T10:10:48  <abourget> with send_keys() ?
2011-07-29T10:10:52  <jimevans> yes
2011-07-29T10:11:58  <abourget> hmm.. how do we specify that ?
2011-07-29T10:12:20  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: is there a Keys-like enum or class in the Python bindings?
2011-07-29T10:12:25  <AutomatedTester> keyyea
2011-07-29T10:12:28  <AutomatedTester> doh
2011-07-29T10:12:30  <AutomatedTester> yea

2011-07-29T10:13:11  <abourget> ok, I'll have a look..

2011-07-29T10:13:51  <RossPatterson> Ajay: You know you can download Visual Studio Express for free, right?
2011-07-29T10:15:07  <RossPatterson> http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express
2011-07-29T10:15:31  <Ajay> RossPatterson: just came to know that , Thanks for the info , i have been never out of eclipse
2011-07-29T10:16:01  <RossPatterson> Yeah, I figured it was probably a cost issue, not an I-hate-Visual-Studio issue.
2011-07-29T10:17:16  * jimevans likes the debugging experience in Visual Studio
2011-07-29T10:17:32  <RossPatterson> Yes, VS is a nice debugger.
2011-07-29T10:18:11  <dawagner> AutomatedTester: I'm still undecided on making arbitrarily static methods static, but I probably would...

2011-07-29T10:19:00  <AutomatedTester> dawagner: perhaps it needs to live in selenium.webdriver.common.utils and not be part of a class?
2011-07-29T10:19:25  <dawagner> Seems fair :) Although tbh with its only-one-usage, it could just be inlined...
2011-07-29T10:19:45  <AutomatedTester> in that case I would drop the @static
2011-07-29T10:19:54  <AutomatedTester> since its internal to the class
2011-07-29T10:19:59  <AutomatedTester> but that is my preference
2011-07-29T10:20:23  <AutomatedTester> and I would make it private since it doesnt need to be shared
2011-07-29T10:21:25  <AutomatedTester> I am not a big fan of static methods unless they are necessary
2011-07-29T10:21:31  <AutomatedTester> but thats my opinion
2011-07-29T10:22:50  <dawagner> AutomatedTester: Will do :) private as in _foo or as in __foo?
2011-07-29T10:23:07  <AutomatedTester> _foo
2011-07-29T10:23:27  <AutomatedTester> __foo is Mark Pilgram's approach

2011-07-29T14:44:52  <XRayCulver> i see its readonly now
2011-07-29T14:44:59  <XRayCulver> is it sendkeys() now?
2011-07-29T14:45:26  <AutomatedTester> yea
2011-07-29T14:45:43  <AutomatedTester> all typing should go through sendkeys
