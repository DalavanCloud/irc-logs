2011-08-15T03:56:07  <beowulf> hi, in python/webdriver how do i get the width of an element?
2011-08-15T03:57:17  <AutomatedTester> beowulf: get the size which returns a dictionary
2011-08-15T03:57:24  <AutomatedTester> and then ask the dictionary for the width
2011-08-15T03:58:25  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-08-15T03:58:35  <beowulf> AutomatedTester: how do i get the size? :)
2011-08-15T03:58:49  <AutomatedTester> its on the webelement

2011-08-15T04:12:21  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: i dont think that is what i mean. i want to be able to change the locator without having to change the find_by_  associated with it
2011-08-15T04:12:51  <AutomatedTester> well thats the generic way
2011-08-15T04:14:01  <AutomatedTester> all you need to do is change the by=
2011-08-15T04:14:40  <adamgoucher> right. but there is no way in the api (that i can see) to just have it pass in a locator and it 'does the right thing'
2011-08-15T04:15:21  <AutomatedTester> so if you do find_element("foo", 'locator"), if foo doesnt exist then it will fail
2011-08-15T04:15:28  <AutomatedTester> otherwise it will try use foo
2011-08-15T04:16:12  <beowulf> barancev|2: cheers
2011-08-15T04:16:14  <AutomatedTester> so you just change the first arguement when you need to change it and it works
2011-08-15T04:16:30  *** ian_mac has quit IRC
2011-08-15T04:16:55  <adamgoucher> ya, ive got that. i just dont wnt to have to change the By argument
2011-08-15T04:18:02  *** ian_mac has joined #selenium
2011-08-15T04:19:03  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: if you were willing to change it that would make your code simpler
2011-08-15T04:22:13  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: if you had a dictionary mapping between your shortcut names and the full webdriver names that would also make your code simpler
2011-08-15T04:23:01  <adamgoucher> hmmm. likely.
2011-08-15T04:23:43  <adamgoucher> right now things are a tangled mess as i discover how many rc assumptions i didnt plan on are in there

2011-08-15T04:29:25  <jimevans> ho
2011-08-15T04:29:30  <jimevans> or hi even.
2011-08-15T04:29:35  <jimevans> not enough coffee yet.
2011-08-15T04:29:51  <Binken_> Still tired?
2011-08-15T04:30:06  <jimevans> just booted up... :)
2011-08-15T04:30:37  <Binken_> Oh
2011-08-15T04:31:53  <AutomatedTester> hey jimevans
2011-08-15T04:32:05  <jimevans> hi, AutomatedTester
2011-08-15T04:32:13  <Binken_> (H) Jim, the latest version click action do not fire the JQuery onchange event.....Sucks me..
2011-08-15T04:32:22  <Binken_> <(
2011-08-15T04:32:50  <jimevans> hang on a second.
2011-08-15T04:32:54  <Binken_> I mean click the option
2011-08-15T04:33:29  <AutomatedTester> jimevans has just gone into a fit of rage, please hold on till he returns
2011-08-15T04:33:41  <jimevans> had to update twitter.
2011-08-15T04:33:48  <Binken_> (ue)
2011-08-15T04:34:18  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: i think your click on overflow links works
2011-08-15T04:34:32  <jimevans> for firefox too?
2011-08-15T04:34:44  <AutomatedTester> yea, I just wrote a test and didnt see a failure
2011-08-15T04:34:48  <jimevans> w00t!
2011-08-15T04:35:02  <AutomatedTester> i put it into the firefox js and it passed
2011-08-15T04:35:17  <Binken_> (H) AutomatedTester, I still have no clue for the #2077. I have checked the change during the period.
2011-08-15T04:35:17  <selbot2>  open/new FirefoxDriver doesn't send tab - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2077 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium]
2011-08-15T04:35:58  <AutomatedTester> ok, my test passes
2011-08-15T04:36:06  <AutomatedTester> lets run the entire suite now
2011-08-15T04:36:52  <jimevans> the "click on the first client rect" idea was Simon's. I can't take credit for it, just the implementation in IE. :)
2011-08-15T04:37:08  <AutomatedTester> as a team we rock!
2011-08-15T04:37:13  <jimevans> indeed we do.
2011-08-15T04:37:17  <Binken_> Jim, is there way for me to debug the webdriver including the c++ code?
2011-08-15T04:37:49  <jimevans> yes. you're using C# right?
2011-08-15T04:37:58  <Binken_> Yeah
2011-08-15T04:38:17  <jimevans> so you have a full (not "express") version of Visual Studio?
2011-08-15T04:38:22  <Binken_> Yes
2011-08-15T04:39:04  <jimevans> what testing framework do you use (NUnit, MBUnit, etc)?
2011-08-15T04:39:12  <Binken_> NUnit
2011-08-15T04:39:20  <jimevans> cool. then it's pretty easy.
2011-08-15T04:39:34  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: tests failed but not because of that
2011-08-15T04:39:38  <jimevans> Load your tests using NUnit.exe.
2011-08-15T04:39:40  <AutomatedTester> eranm: g'day!
2011-08-15T04:39:56  <Binken_> Jim, I know the attach the process :)
2011-08-15T04:40:11  <jimevans> then attach to the NUnit process in Visual Studio, but make sure you're attaching for "native code"
2011-08-15T04:40:47  <Binken_> I mean if I click some element but not work as expected.
2011-08-15T04:41:03  <Binken_> Like some issues on the webdriver issue list
2011-08-15T04:41:17  <Binken_> I wanna to fix this kind of issue by own.
2011-08-15T04:41:19  <jimevans> by default VS attaches to "automatically determine the type of code to debug"
2011-08-15T04:42:18  <Binken_> (H) So how do you guys focus on these issue and fix it
2011-08-15T04:42:52  <jimevans> you'll probably also need to build the C++ dlls to get the .pdb files
2011-08-15T04:43:10  *** csanchez has quit IRC
2011-08-15T04:43:15  <jimevans> depends on the issue.
2011-08-15T04:43:21  <Binken_> Yeah
2011-08-15T04:43:50  <Binken_> I see there's plenty c++ project
2011-08-15T04:44:16  <jimevans> the one you'll be interested in is the IEDriver project.
2011-08-15T04:44:31  <Binken_> Yes
2011-08-15T04:44:32  <jimevans> I *think* the code in there is pretty well organized.
2011-08-15T04:45:45  <Binken_> The clickelementcommandhandler will be the click action?
2011-08-15T04:46:13  <jimevans> yes.
2011-08-15T04:46:25  <jimevans> but that mostly delegates to Element::Click()
2011-08-15T04:46:30  <Binken_> I see the option's click
2011-08-15T04:47:00  <jimevans> if you're trying to debug the option click, you'll be disappointed with debugging the C++ code
2011-08-15T04:47:26  <Binken_> it takes the atoms?
2011-08-15T04:47:33  <jimevans> most of that delegates to the click atom, which is minified javascript code.
2011-08-15T04:48:30  <Binken_> Where can I find this?
2011-08-15T04:48:49  <Binken_> atoms.h?
2011-08-15T04:48:58  <jimevans> the atoms sources are under the javascript tree. the translated, minified code is written into atoms.h
2011-08-15T04:49:43  <Binken_> under \javascript\atoms?
2011-08-15T04:49:54  <jimevans> yes
2011-08-15T04:53:14  <Binken_> Is there a good tools to debug those js?
2011-08-15T04:53:59  <jimevans> Binken_: i have no idea. i don't really know the atoms code very well, and i don't debug it very often.

2011-08-15T04:55:10  *** ian_mac has quit IRC
2011-08-15T04:55:19  <jimevans> I know there's a way to start the server in a debug mode, and you can test the atoms using just the browser, but I can never remember the target to the "go" build script to do that.
2011-08-15T04:55:50  <Binken_> :-) Thanks
2011-08-15T04:59:32  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: is there a click_element() that will find the element, then click it? (guessing not)
2011-08-15T05:00:04  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: no the idiom is find the element then use it
2011-08-15T05:00:17  <AutomatedTester> so find_element then do X on element
2011-08-15T05:00:38  *** sdimkov has quit IRC

2011-08-15T05:01:04  *** sdimkov has joined #selenium
2011-08-15T05:01:13  <AutomatedTester> you do shortcuts like that in your Page Objects or what ever
2011-08-15T05:01:52  <AutomatedTester> it means that once you have the object from finding it you can use it a number of times
2011-08-15T05:03:25  <adamgoucher> ok. i retract that particular grumble
2011-08-15T05:04:02  * AutomatedTester will blog about it so that people understand why
2011-08-15T05:04:34  <Binken_> (H) Anyone could tell me where is click options in atoms
2011-08-15T05:04:57  <AutomatedTester> Binken_: is there a click.js?
2011-08-15T05:05:25  <Binken_> under javascript\atoms, the answer is no
2011-08-15T05:06:04  <jimevans> it's in actions.js
2011-08-15T05:06:11  <jimevans> action.js.
2011-08-15T05:06:58  <Binken_> Thanks, I am gonna to find which block the onchange event on JQuery
2011-08-15T05:07:11  <jimevans> good luck with that.

2011-08-15T05:42:50  <lord1234> any idea why selenium would work fast as heck on one machine, and slow as hell on another?
2011-08-15T05:43:04  <AutomatedTester> jarib / jimevans / eranm is there a bug for Mac Native events
2011-08-15T05:44:01  <RossPatterson> lord1234: Same combination of OS/browser/etc.?  And Selenium RC, if I recall, right?
2011-08-15T05:44:06  <lord1234> webdriver
2011-08-15T05:44:10  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: so one could do driver.find_element().click() if you knew you only needed it once or e = driver.find_element, e.click(), e.click(), e.click() for multiple usage (assuming the page didnt refresh and go stale)
2011-08-15T05:44:11  <lord1234> i've made the switch
2011-08-15T05:44:18  <lord1234> same combination of everything else though, yes.

2011-08-15T05:47:47  <adamgoucher> *perhaps* if people are indendently creating the same function, it should be in the main library...
2011-08-15T05:49:48  <AutomatedTester> lord1234: did you do this for porting to webdriver?
2011-08-15T05:49:56  <lord1234> AutomatedTester: yes
2011-08-15T05:50:04  <lord1234> it was too huge a pain in the ass otherwise
2011-08-15T05:50:22  <AutomatedTester> isn't there a shortcut in ruby to turn "x" into :x?
2011-08-15T05:50:35  <AutomatedTester> without having to do a switch?
2011-08-15T05:50:36  <lord1234> i'll admit to still considering myself a novice at ruby
2011-08-15T05:50:40  <lord1234> if you know of one, I'd love it.
2011-08-15T05:50:47  <RossPatterson> We've wrapped almost the entire RC API, for a variety of purposes.  We wait for elements to be present before clicking, typing, etc., we catch exceptions and capture screenshots before allowing it to percolate, etc.  But we started after the RC API was declared frozen for future work.
2011-08-15T05:50:47  <AutomatedTester> jarib: ^
2011-08-15T05:50:51  <jimevans> to_sym()?
2011-08-15T05:51:03  <jimevans> or perhaps to_symbol()?
2011-08-15T05:51:24  <lord1234> to_sym
2011-08-15T05:51:28  <lord1234> well i learn somethign new every day
2011-08-15T05:51:28  <AutomatedTester> because if you can change "x" to :x you lose the switch
2011-08-15T05:51:37  <AutomatedTester> and delete a whole bunch of code
2011-08-15T05:51:43  <lord1234> yep
2011-08-15T05:51:52  <AutomatedTester> this is what I was trying to suggest to adamgoucher
2011-08-15T05:52:31  <adamgoucher> heh. : x is apparently a smilie in adium
2011-08-15T05:52:53  <lord1234> 20 lines of code
2011-08-15T05:52:54  <lord1234> down to 2
2011-08-15T05:52:55  <lord1234> $waiter.until{ $browser.find_element(object_type.to_sym => object_identifier) }       element = $browser.find_element(object_type.to_sym => object_identifier)
2011-08-15T05:53:19  <AutomatedTester> lord1234: less code == less chance of bugs
2011-08-15T05:53:47  <lord1234> no argument from me:)
2011-08-15T05:53:48  <adamgoucher> that kind of thinking invented perl :P
2011-08-15T05:54:03  <lord1234> so question
2011-08-15T05:54:13  <lord1234> unrelated to selenium(though maybe?)
2011-08-15T05:54:25  <lord1234> if testing PHP based api's, is there an easy way to do it using ruby?  or would I have to test them using SimpleTest or some such?

2011-08-15T06:24:43  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: there is WebDriverWait in selenium.webdriver.support that might help you
2011-08-15T06:27:10  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: is that like sauce's spin wait
2011-08-15T06:27:26  <AutomatedTester> no..
2011-08-15T06:27:26  *** rbalent has quit IRC
2011-08-15T06:27:37  <AutomatedTester> spinwait is the dumbest idea in the world...
2011-08-15T06:27:56  <jarib> what's the difference?
2011-08-15T06:29:10  * adamgoucher really does like that AutomatedTester has tests for the python driver
2011-08-15T06:29:21  * adamgoucher also almost put a hashtag onto that
2011-08-15T06:29:36  <RossPatterson> Without an event-based system, all one can do is poll for status.  Spinning is just fast polling.  I'll grant that high-speed polling can starve the machine of resources and prevent the very event you're polling for, but abset an event system, what's a programmer to do?
2011-08-15T06:30:22  <Elvanor> How do you start Firefox via webdriver on a headless machine (via xvfb)
2011-08-15T06:30:31  <RossPatterson> Of course, JavaScript has an event system, and some of the libraries (e.g., ExtJs) expose it nicely.  But that doesn't help WebDriver users much.
2011-08-15T06:30:44  <lord1234> hey guys
2011-08-15T06:30:45  <lord1234> https://gist.github.com/eeac9aa4efec34d2c25d
2011-08-15T06:30:56  * AutomatedTester rephrases.... I dislike the way they do it because they are not using the exceptions from Selenium/Webdriver
2011-08-15T06:31:12  <AutomatedTester> and instead start sprinkling their code with their assert framework
2011-08-15T06:31:23  <lord1234> jarib:  do you have a similar sample for firefox and IE?
2011-08-15T06:31:24  <AutomatedTester> asserts should be in tests
2011-08-15T06:31:24  <jarib> Elvanor: as long as the DISPLAY env var is set pointing to the xvfb display, you just use webdriver like you normally would
2011-08-15T06:31:26  <lord1234> cuz you would be my best friend.
2011-08-15T06:31:38  <lord1234> also, does anyone have an ideas with my gist...i can't make hide nor hair of it
2011-08-15T06:31:39  <jarib> lord1234: sample of what?

2011-08-15T06:31:58  <lord1234> Elvanor: i do it the following way

2011-08-15T06:32:15  <lord1234> in jenkins
2011-08-15T06:32:25  <Elvanor> what's test1?
2011-08-15T06:32:34  <lord1234> or that is
2011-08-15T06:32:38  <lord1234> here lemme screenshot it for u
2011-08-15T06:32:44  <jarib> lord1234: you mean DISPLAY=:1
2011-08-15T06:32:52  <Elvanor> /usr/local/opt/grails/bin/grails test run-selenium-functional-tests
2011-08-15T06:32:53  <jarib> Elvanor: i think jenkins has an xvfb plugin that handles this for you
2011-08-15T06:33:03  <lord1234> jarib, yes
2011-08-15T06:33:06  <Elvanor> this is how I normally load tests
2011-08-15T06:33:07  <jarib> at least it did last time i used it
2011-08-15T06:33:25  <jarib> Elvanor: so you'd do `DISPLAY=:1 /usr/local/opt/grails/bin/grails test run-selenium-functional-tests`
2011-08-15T06:33:34  <lord1234> yep exactly
2011-08-15T06:33:36  <jarib> (assuming xvfb is running on display :1)
2011-08-15T06:33:36  <lord1234> sorry thats what i meant
2011-08-15T06:33:41  <Elvanor> hmm ok i am going to try that
2011-08-15T06:33:45  <lord1234> i slept like 20 minutes last nite....
2011-08-15T06:33:53  <jarib> or just use the xvfb plugin.
2011-08-15T06:34:13  <lord1234> any idea on my gist jarib?
2011-08-15T06:34:28  <lord1234> the placement of the tooltip only appears like that in firefox when its running from webdriver, otherwise it's ok
2011-08-15T06:35:53  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: feel free to tweet that I write tests for the drivers :)
2011-08-15T06:37:01  <Elvanor> Next step would be to load a VM and run these tests in Windows (IE) :)
2011-08-15T06:37:12  <Elvanor> (base machine is Linux of course)
2011-08-15T06:39:03  <RossPatterson> AutomatedTester: Just re-read the Sauce article, and compared it with our WaitForTextPresent().  Similar, but we allow the actual exceptions to percolate out if they're not the expected one (e.g., element not found).  That makes all the difference in the world - we don't mask "bad XPath" errors, etc.
2011-08-15T06:39:48  <AutomatedTester> RossPatterson: yea, the idea in general is sound, I just dont like their approach to it
2011-08-15T06:42:25  <lord1234> jarib: i was told to bother you about helping with documentation for ruby bindings...can i help?

2011-08-15T07:32:20  <ChrisCulver> is //table/tbody/tr/td[2]/text()[2] valid for our xpath selector?
2011-08-15T07:32:26  <ChrisCulver> does it support text()?

2011-08-15T07:32:41  <RossPatterson> No
2011-08-15T07:32:48  <RossPatterson> You can't index "text()"
2011-08-15T07:33:04  <RossPatterson> Because it returns a single string.

2011-08-15T07:36:15  <jarib> ChrisCulver: (a) improve the markup, (b) fetch the text of both the td and the span, then remove the span's text from the td's
2011-08-15T07:36:22  <jarib> where (a) is much preferred of course.
2011-08-15T07:37:58  <RossPatterson> ".../td/text()" ought to do the job.  The text() selector only selects the immediate children of the parent, not all descendents.
2011-08-15T07:38:26  <RossPatterson> To get "DOB:", you'd need ".../td/span/text()".

2011-08-15T08:20:50  <ChrisCulver> you need to have a main method

2011-08-15T08:39:01  <lukeis> perfectly within the realm of a SQA to do so IMO

2011-08-15T08:40:09  <lord1234> its just that technically if the dves are refactoring the "entire" system, i shouldn't have to do it all over again...should I?
2011-08-15T08:41:09  <lukeis> if they've refactored it then you get to tell them it's broken... cause they didn't port all functionality ... like id's :)
2011-08-15T08:41:20  <lukeis> same "functionality" but different code?

2011-08-15T08:46:06  <emil_temp_nick> ok, but is there any links that need to be setup between c#(vs) and selenium ide?
2011-08-15T08:46:18  <ChrisCulver> after you import it
2011-08-15T08:46:37  <ChrisCulver> you will have using OpenQA.Selenium at the top of your class
2011-08-15T08:47:10  <ChrisCulver> import = adding a reference either with nuget or downloading it manually and adding the reference manually

2011-08-15T08:49:41  <ChrisCulver> emil_temp_nick: with c# you will create one of 2 types of projects, one that runs by itself(console/windows app are 2 basic examples) and one that creates a dll that is used by other applications/projects
2011-08-15T08:49:57  <ChrisCulver> in your case you want to create a console app that runs by itself

2011-08-15T08:57:31  <emil_temp_nick> i have used other comercial automated tools before, but now i'm trying selenium/C#
2011-08-15T08:57:37  <ChrisCulver> ah ok
2011-08-15T08:57:50  <ChrisCulver> whats your goal for automation?
2011-08-15T08:58:27  * lukeis just breaks sh!t
2011-08-15T08:58:39  * ChrisCulver gives lukeis a high five
2011-08-15T08:59:02  <emil_temp_nick> either try this project with selenium/c or try other tools
2011-08-15T08:59:30  <ChrisCulver> emil_temp_nick: i have a hudson/jenkins build server that runs a build script that loads my tests into nunit
2011-08-15T08:59:42  <ChrisCulver> i'd concentrate on nunit and c#
2011-08-15T08:59:50  <ChrisCulver> so in that case your creating a dll project
2011-08-15T09:00:00  <ChrisCulver> that the nunit console/testrunner consumes
2011-08-15T09:00:27  <ChrisCulver> do you have any programming background?

2011-08-15T09:02:58  <ChrisCulver> vbscript
2011-08-15T09:03:13  <cgoldberg> ruby quicker to learn than python?  blasphemy

2011-08-15T10:09:32  <lord1234> same version

2011-08-15T10:11:44  <lukeis> my guess is if you set all the preferences like webdriver does and don't load the webdriver.xpi you'll be able to see the same issue

2011-08-15T10:44:35  <Elvanor> I have a problem with Coordinates
2011-08-15T10:44:51  <doc_tuna> basically i've got a link that appends some stuff to the dom whic i then need to interact with
2011-08-15T10:44:56  <lukeis> doc_tuna: RC or webdriver?
2011-08-15T10:44:59  <doc_tuna> webdriver
2011-08-15T10:45:05  <Elvanor> I have a DOM element, and if I get its coordinates and pass it to a click() it seems on Firefox the click is done at top left of element, but on Chrome it is done on center
2011-08-15T10:45:14  <Elvanor> how can i control where the click takes place precisely
2011-08-15T10:45:18  <Elvanor> this is important
2011-08-15T10:45:23  <Elvanor> (in my case)

2011-08-15T10:49:24  <lukeis> Elvanor: sounds potentially like a bug in chromedriver... can you make sure you have the latest version of chromedriver and chrome running (14+  i'm not sure the latest version?). I also don't know much about coordinate clicking though... haven't needed to do it
2011-08-15T10:49:51  <lukeis> if it is a bug, you'll need to log it against the chromium project
2011-08-15T10:49:54  <Elvanor> lukeis: just a simple click() on the element triggers the same problem
2011-08-15T10:50:06  <Elvanor> lukeis: for me it is more of a problem in the selenium API
2011-08-15T10:50:16  <Elvanor> there is no way to control *where* the click takes place
2011-08-15T10:50:23  <ChrisCulver> each driver determines the click

2011-08-15T10:51:56  <doc_tuna> lukeis: I'm having the same issue as when I manually looped until the element existed
2011-08-15T10:52:08  <doc_tuna> didn't get this error previously:
2011-08-15T10:52:10  <doc_tuna> selenium.common.exceptions.StaleElementReferenceException: Message: u"Element is no longer attached to the DOM (WARNING: The server did not provide any stacktrace information)
2011-08-15T10:52:13  <adamgoucher> crud. firefox 6 is released tomorrow. do we place bets on how busted (or not) se-ide is with it?
2011-08-15T10:52:31  <Elvanor> There is also no way of building coordinates manually
2011-08-15T10:52:53  <doc_tuna> The thing is the element is not being removed, it's only created and then stays on the page, so I'm not sure how this exception is relevent
2011-08-15T10:53:15  <lukeis> Elvanor: you can control where to click with coordinates using the Actions class in java.... (new Actions(driver)).moveToElement(element, X-offset, Y-offset).click().perform()

2011-08-15T10:55:09  <Elvanor> lukeis: yes that looks useful
2011-08-15T10:55:24  <Elvanor> but what is the base coordinate then when using moveToElement(element, X-offset, Y-offset)
2011-08-15T10:55:30  <lukeis> 0,0
2011-08-15T10:55:53  <doc_tuna> lukeis: you're right, it is removed and then recreated.
2011-08-15T10:56:10  <lukeis> doc_tuna: then you're wait can expect that condition
2011-08-15T10:56:11  <doc_tuna> not sure why the old version didn't get stuck on the first element like this
2011-08-15T10:56:18  <doc_tuna> yeah thank you

2011-08-15T11:00:36  <doc_tuna> oh i can't seem to grab the new element by id since there was an old one that was removed

2011-08-15T11:00:55  <Elvanor> lukeis: does not work at all
2011-08-15T11:00:57  <doc_tuna> but i think this may qualify as a bug?
2011-08-15T11:01:35  <doc_tuna> create element with id "a", delete it, create new element with id "a", get_element_by_id -> it complains that element is not in DOM anymore

2011-08-15T11:03:06  <lukeis> Elvanor: care to elaborate? native events don't work on Mac OS (known) and i think they are still disabled on linux, but you can enable them, hoping you work on windows

2011-08-15T11:05:43  <doc_tuna> going to work around it first
2011-08-15T11:06:52  <lukeis> Elvanor: then enable them... you have to create a firefox profile and then setEnableNativeEvents(true)  before you create your firefox instance
2011-08-15T11:07:11  <Elvanor> lukeis: this is with the chrome driver
2011-08-15T11:07:21  <lukeis> ok... hmm
2011-08-15T11:07:24  *** andreashaas has quit IRC
2011-08-15T11:07:44  <Elvanor> This is really strange. When I print the coordinates in the viewport, I get the correct values, but it really seems Chrome clicks at a different place
2011-08-15T11:07:59  <Elvanor> since the behavior I am observing corresponds to a place with a different click

2011-08-15T11:21:08  <Elvanor> lukeis: Ok so I would say there is a bug in the click() method on Chrome for an element. but the action actually do work, now that I investigated further
2011-08-15T11:21:41  <Elvanor> by outputting the actual coordinates of the event via a JS alert() on my host page, I found out that Chrome effectively clicks at the center of the element

2011-08-15T11:23:56  <BDBeasley_grails> well i'll go ahead and ask..... Is there any way to have selenium webdriver run without opening a physical browser window?
2011-08-15T11:24:17  <lukeis> you can really only do that with HtmlUnitDriver
2011-08-15T11:24:28  <adamgoucher> if you are using java, it has the option to use it htmlunit
2011-08-15T11:24:36  <BDBeasley_grails> The reason I ask is that we have a Continuous integration system (CI), which, during functional testing we want it to save as much time as possible
2011-08-15T11:24:49  <BDBeasley_grails> it's only during making the tests that we want to see the window
2011-08-15T11:24:52  <lukeis> then HtmlUnit is your answer
2011-08-15T11:24:57  <BDBeasley_grails> :O
2011-08-15T11:25:02  <BDBeasley_grails> cool! so it's possible

2011-08-15T11:25:46  <adamgoucher> testing a browser-based application without using a browser seems like a bad idea. regardless of the technical possibility / coolness.

2011-08-15T11:27:39  <BDBeasley_grails> so I figure there's an opportunity to save time, by cutting out the display of a browser somehow
2011-08-15T11:27:52  <lukeis> buildserver +xvfb (or xvnc) +chrome is a good way to go
2011-08-15T11:28:07  <adamgoucher> use xvfb/xvnc then. and if things are still too slow, look at slicing your scripts
2011-08-15T11:28:41  <lukeis> and run as much in parallel as your hardware can take :)

2011-08-15T11:33:56  <BDBeasley_grails> 1 more question, is this: when you have more than 1 test, does a new browser get opened for each webdriver test? If so, does anyone use a pool of webdrivers or a cache so they can say "run these webdriver tests, but maintain a max of 5 browsers at any given time
2011-08-15T11:34:14  <lukeis> i do exactly that
2011-08-15T11:34:19  <lukeis> pool of browsers

2011-08-15T13:51:26  <__mike> for IE at least
2011-08-15T13:51:52  <ChrisCulver> lukeis: thats the javascript function?
2011-08-15T13:51:58  <lukeis> yeah
2011-08-15T13:52:36  <lukeis> window.resizeTo(400,400)  or whatever... but as mike says, not 100% accurate if you're looking for pixel x pixel size
2011-08-15T13:52:50  <lukeis> depending on OS, browser version... etc
2011-08-15T13:53:07  <lukeis> sounds like you're going for general sizes though
2011-08-15T13:53:56  <ChrisCulver> yah, just 1024x768

2011-08-15T13:58:20  <ChrisCulver> thanks for the help
2011-08-15T14:03:48  <ChrisCulver> is there anything built into ff like inspect element in chrome and ie?
2011-08-15T14:03:51  <ChrisCulver> or is that only with firebug?
2011-08-15T14:05:46  <lukeis> firebug afaik

2011-08-15T14:15:24  <AutomatedTester> ChrisCulver: lukeis in Firefox if you highlight the item and right click it you can see the source just for that item
2011-08-15T14:15:33  <AutomatedTester> but firebug is a better way to do it
2011-08-15T14:15:55  <AutomatedTester> there is however major changes happening to web dev tools in Firefox over the next few versions

2011-08-15T14:16:26  <__mike> Hi AutomatedTester. For tomorrow, is it possible for me to bring someone who has not signed up?
2011-08-15T14:17:22  <AutomatedTester> __mike: I don't think so but if you come in tomorrow to here and ask again I will try ask the organisers
2011-08-15T14:17:44  <__mike> Ah I unfortunately am not able to come on IRC whilst at work.. :(
2011-08-15T14:17:49  <AutomatedTester> we dont want to turn people away and its not up to me to add people without checking
2011-08-15T14:17:57  <__mike> Are there still spaces?
2011-08-15T14:18:02  <AutomatedTester> i dont know
2011-08-15T14:18:07  <AutomatedTester> i need to ask

2011-08-15T14:18:34  <__mike> Ah right :/
2011-08-15T14:18:42  <AutomatedTester> can't you use the web irc client?
2011-08-15T14:18:49  <__mike> Blocked :(
2011-08-15T14:19:02  <AutomatedTester> your phone?
2011-08-15T14:19:43  <__mike> Is it possible I text you?
2011-08-15T14:20:01  <__mike> Sorry for the inconvenience..
2011-08-15T14:20:08  <__mike> I'm quite looking forward to the event actually
2011-08-15T14:20:53  <AutomatedTester> is your friend signed up to meetup?

2011-08-15T14:21:43  <__mike> Nope. And that's also blocked at work..
2011-08-15T14:21:52  <__mike> But basically he's not able to find out if he's able to come till tomorrow
2011-08-15T14:22:09  <selbot2> dawagner less than 20 seconds ago - DanielWagnerHall: Disable Android tests until android support lands - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=13384

2011-08-15T14:22:47  <AutomatedTester> well if he isnt on meetup we can't give his details to security
2011-08-15T14:23:17  <__mike> I can give you his details now?
2011-08-15T14:23:36  <AutomatedTester> for me to create his meetup account?
2011-08-15T14:24:03  <__mike> Nono. For you to give security? I'm not sure. What do you think is the best way to do this?
2011-08-15T14:24:17  <davehunt> It's too late to provide security details
2011-08-15T14:24:25  <davehunt> The badges are being printed tonight
2011-08-15T14:24:33  <davehunt> Come along tomorrow and we'll get you in
2011-08-15T14:24:48  <__mike> Ahh cheers! I hope it works out, looking forward to it a lot ;)
2011-08-15T14:26:19  <__mike> Going to sleep now. I'll see you tomorrow!

2011-08-15T14:37:29  <qwebirc660875> to instantiate 5 different firefox webdrivers, I would need to make 5 different firefox profiles. is that correct?
2011-08-15T14:38:04  <__mike> no. unless you want to pass in a profile to each one
2011-08-15T14:38:11  <__mike> otherwise they are created with a new/anonymous profile
2011-08-15T14:38:34  <AutomatedTester> you can't share a profile between firefox instances
2011-08-15T14:38:40  <AutomatedTester> while they are open
2011-08-15T14:39:35  <qwebirc660875> so you're saying that by default, when I say 'create a firefox driver instance", it gets its own unique profile. right?
2011-08-15T14:39:42  <__mike> yes
2011-08-15T14:39:54  <qwebirc660875> well that makes it just plain easy for me doens it. :D
2011-08-15T14:40:09  <__mike> selenium is pretty good after all ;)
2011-08-15T14:40:30  <qwebirc660875> its almost... TOO easy
2011-08-15T14:41:28  <AutomatedTester> qwebirc660875: when it makes coffee for me then I have done my job
2011-08-15T14:42:46  <qwebirc660875> does webdriver support using Xvfb?

2011-08-15T14:43:02  <lukeis> AutomatedTester: when it writes my tests for me, then you'll be there. Hmm, i wonder how hard it would be to automate IDE ;)
2011-08-15T14:43:22  <lukeis> automate using IDE that is
2011-08-15T14:43:26  <AutomatedTester> lukeis: davehunt has automated the IDE
2011-08-15T14:43:29  <lukeis> nice
2011-08-15T14:43:37  <AutomatedTester> and runs part of our CI process
2011-08-15T14:43:41  <lukeis> automate the automation

2011-08-15T14:44:48  <lukeis> at least it's not qtp :))
2011-08-15T14:45:05  <AutomatedTester> lukeis: ever do winrunner?
2011-08-15T14:45:12  <lukeis> nope
2011-08-15T14:45:20  <AutomatedTester> that was before qtp
2011-08-15T14:45:33  <AutomatedTester> thats how i got into automation
2011-08-15T14:45:41  <AutomatedTester> writing TSL
2011-08-15T14:46:00  * lukeis wasn't a tester before... but tried to write unit / integration tests for my UI code... started in python with PAMIE
2011-08-15T14:46:16  * AutomatedTester didnt start as a tester
2011-08-15T14:46:25  <qwebirc660875> neither did i
2011-08-15T14:46:34  <lord1234> i started as a tester
2011-08-15T14:46:45  <qwebirc660875> im new to testing. 1 week
2011-08-15T14:47:07  <lukeis> 8 years of dev and found a higher paying dev job as an automated tester ;)
2011-08-15T14:48:29  <qwebirc660875> really???
2011-08-15T14:48:31  <lukeis> ahh, pamie still lives... http://pamie.sourceforge.net/   brings a tear to my eye :)
2011-08-15T14:49:23  <lukeis> yeah... either I was being paid crap before.... or this place is paying too much for the role ;)
2011-08-15T14:50:30  * AutomatedTester started doing process reengineering and then got asked to start up testing for a startup
2011-08-15T14:50:42  <AutomatedTester> and setup CIs and taught them to do test automation
2011-08-15T14:52:22  <lukeis> that's the stuff one of my friends does (CI's setting up the automation) he loves it, brought me over to where i am now... i said, am I coding? yes. no manual crap? yes. Ok, let's do it
2011-08-15T14:53:16  <lukeis> last place i was at seemed to be ok with customers finding bugs in production... glad to be gone from there
2011-08-15T14:53:30  * AutomatedTester hasnt do setting up CIs in a while
2011-08-15T14:53:55  <AutomatedTester> been more interested in being a testing evangelist for automation
2011-08-15T14:54:04  <AutomatedTester> plus working on this project is quite cool
2011-08-15T14:55:15  <lukeis> yeah, i like spending a good percentage of my time on Se... they don't seem to mind having a resident 'expert' on the topic either... they think i'm an expert, i still have to look up half the stuff :)
2011-08-15T14:55:50  * AutomatedTester sees an opportunity to write another book
2011-08-15T14:56:04  <lukeis> plenty of those to be had :)
2011-08-15T14:56:21  <AutomatedTester> lukeis: are you SeRC or WebDriver?
2011-08-15T14:56:26  <lukeis> WebDriver
2011-08-15T14:56:39  <lukeis> with maintenance of some RC
2011-08-15T14:56:59  <AutomatedTester> my last book can help with the maintenance stuff :P
2011-08-15T14:57:10  <lukeis> mainly i kill the RC stuff cause they didn't know what a design pattern was and make a new webdriver test
2011-08-15T14:58:20  <qwebirc660875> @lukeis, yeah selenium has soooo much stuff, i've got so much reading to do
2011-08-15T14:58:35  *** andytinkham has joined #selenium
2011-08-15T14:59:06  <lukeis> eh, the webdriver api is pretty easy to get up to speed on... figuring out the subtle nuances between browsers/drivers takes some more time
2011-08-15T15:01:32  <lukeis> the "framework" for RC that was here only allowed xpath locators... yuck.
2011-08-15T15:02:25  <qwebirc660875> those are useful. would be a pain if we had to use them all the time
2011-08-15T15:02:48  <qwebirc660875> i like By.id()
2011-08-15T15:02:49  <lukeis> yeah... the point is it's just ONE way to locate elements... not the only
2011-08-15T15:02:56  <lukeis> i like the By pattern
2011-08-15T15:03:11  <qwebirc660875> it's almost liek english
2011-08-15T15:03:15  <qwebirc660875> rather than code
2011-08-15T15:03:40  <lukeis> yeah, fluent coding is definitely a style I like... why i use fluent asserts too
2011-08-15T15:03:50  <AutomatedTester> qwebirc660875: since a lot of the project team are based in the UK it has an obvious bias :D
2011-08-15T15:07:15  <lukeis> speaking of fluent coding... AutomatedTester: any notion to make the python bindings a little more like the java? like webdriver.find_element(by....) rather than everything on the webdriver object?
2011-08-15T15:07:53  * lukeis bets that has been discussed / debated before...
2011-08-15T15:08:11  <AutomatedTester> find_element(by, locator) is there
2011-08-15T15:08:35  <lukeis> ah... i'm just blind :)
2011-08-15T15:08:42  <AutomatedTester> :)
2011-08-15T15:08:52  <AutomatedTester> its there as well as the helper methods
2011-08-15T15:09:01  <AutomatedTester> and both languages have the helper methods
2011-08-15T15:10:30  <lukeis> what do you mean by helper methods?
2011-08-15T15:10:45  <lukeis> the find_element_by_id?
2011-08-15T15:11:16  <AutomatedTester> yea
2011-08-15T15:11:30  <lukeis> java doesn't have those (anymore)
2011-08-15T15:12:12  <AutomatedTester> they dd and I argued to have them removed
2011-08-15T15:12:18  <AutomatedTester> and was told over my dead body
2011-08-15T15:12:23  <AutomatedTester> this really annoys me
2011-08-15T15:12:24  <lukeis> and now they are gone ;)
2011-08-15T15:12:28  <qwebirc660875> i wonder how you can tell if a webdriver has been closed
2011-08-15T15:13:01  <lukeis> you'll get an exception on any command after close or quit have been called
2011-08-15T15:13:22  <qwebirc660875> hmm
2011-08-15T15:13:34  <lukeis> (close if it's the last window)
2011-08-15T15:13:42  <qwebirc660875> im writing a webdriver pool. the idea is to be able to detect when a driver becomes free
2011-08-15T15:14:06  <qwebirc660875> so i could say "if encountered exception, then he's a free driver". but...
2011-08-15T15:14:10  <lukeis> your code should be handing an instance back to the pool
2011-08-15T15:14:57  <qwebirc660875> could do that too... just wanted to require 1 less manual step for the ppl who'll use the pool
2011-08-15T15:14:57  <lukeis> but.... ?
2011-08-15T15:15:04  <AutomatedTester> lukeis: the findElementById code is still there
2011-08-15T15:15:09  <AutomatedTester> see RemoteWebDriver
2011-08-15T15:15:18  *** __mike has quit IRC
2011-08-15T15:15:45  <lukeis> ahhh... only in remote
2011-08-15T15:16:01  <AutomatedTester> lukeis: and its only in the python remote
2011-08-15T15:16:03  <lukeis> webdriver interface doesn't have it
2011-08-15T15:16:15  <AutomatedTester> no but python doesnt have interfaces
2011-08-15T15:16:19  <lukeis> yeah
2011-08-15T15:16:37  <AutomatedTester> so its in my RemoteWebDriver and I use that as a super class
2011-08-15T15:16:46  <AutomatedTester> which keeps the amount of code small
2011-08-15T15:16:58  <lukeis> bugger... so, when i learned python webdriver i just saw everything in dir()  ... by mass i didn't see just the find_element(s) (
2011-08-15T15:18:01  <lukeis> good thing most of my tests are in java and now i just need to re-train myself for all the one-offs i do in python

2011-08-15T15:24:37  <lukeis> oh, i realize that
2011-08-15T15:24:48  <lisak> I don't know how to deal with @FindBy WebElement field;   that is only optional for the page... for instance just some Locales have it
2011-08-15T15:24:49  <lukeis> i wanted it for what i was doing... so i wrote it and used it
2011-08-15T15:25:24  <lukeis> figured i would write a test around it and give it back to Se :)
2011-08-15T15:25:41  <lisak> whenever I declare @FindBy field it is mandatory
2011-08-15T15:26:38  <lukeis> what language is that for?
2011-08-15T15:26:48  <lukeis> lisak: ^
2011-08-15T15:26:58  <lisak> java

2011-08-15T15:32:09  <lukeis> i think you may need to lookup the element in the class itself, or write your own How class
2011-08-15T15:32:49  <lukeis> scratch that how idea
2011-08-15T15:32:57  <lukeis> it's an enum :-/

2011-08-15T15:36:02  <lukeis> (decided to not use it myself)
2011-08-15T15:38:07  <lukeis> PageFactory class steps across that line I thought was drawn that Se is an automation tool and you choose how to do your framework with it... IMO. so, i chose not to use it. but that may be blasphemy to others (not awake right now) :)

2011-08-15T16:43:08  <towski> is there any easy way to run a selenium test written in java from the command line?
2011-08-15T16:43:20  <simonstewart> Depends on which test framework you use
2011-08-15T16:43:24  <towski> possibly using the selenium-java-client-driver.jar?

2011-08-15T16:45:52  <towski> our qa guy launches the tests using an xml through eclipse right now
2011-08-15T16:51:39  <towski> I guess I need an ant build file to compile the java files, then run the testng xml file

2011-08-15T16:53:38  <simonstewart> I don't use testng very often, but I think it has a command line runner
2011-08-15T16:53:44  <simonstewart> Take a look at the docs on the testng site

2011-08-15T17:05:30  <lord1234> simon what part did you automate?
2011-08-15T17:05:42  <simonstewart> Logging in and sending emails
2011-08-15T17:05:45  <dawagner> Ooh simonstewart is here!
2011-08-15T17:05:56  <dawagner> Semantic question about alert switching
2011-08-15T17:06:07  <dawagner> Do we want to treat switchTo().alert() as idempotent?
2011-08-15T17:06:17  <dawagner> (i.e. if I do it twice without dismissing the first one, should I return the second?)
2011-08-15T17:06:39  <simonstewart> No. If you don't dismiss the first one, you get the first one again
2011-08-15T17:06:48  <dawagner> Awesome :)
2011-08-15T17:06:53  <simonstewart> Unless you perform an action that the alert would block
2011-08-15T17:07:08  <simonstewart> In which case you get an exception, and we dismiss the current alert
2011-08-15T17:07:20  <simonstewart> (so that we can handle the common case where tests fail because of unexpected alerts)
2011-08-15T17:07:27  <dawagner> Cool :)
2011-08-15T17:08:12  <dawagner> If I were to want to re-release the java 2.4.0 as a 2.4.1 with a single cherrypicked revision, would that cause the world to blow up?
2011-08-15T17:08:22  <dawagner> (Or are we near releasing 2.5.0?)
2011-08-15T17:08:26  <simonstewart> What's the change?
2011-08-15T17:08:54  <dawagner> Turns out the RemoteWebDriver is well and truly fucked, and I'm about to push a fix in
2011-08-15T17:09:07  <simonstewart> How is it fucked?
2011-08-15T17:09:10  <dawagner> The server shouldn't currently work if you navigate to more than one page in a single test
2011-08-15T17:09:18  <simonstewart> ?
2011-08-15T17:09:22  <dawagner> Every time it tries to store an element, it does equals comparisons with all other elements you've looked up
2011-08-15T17:09:33  <dawagner> equals comparison after page navigation => stale element exception
2011-08-15T17:09:38  <simonstewart> Handy
2011-08-15T17:09:55  <dawagner> We've only had two reports of it... :p
2011-08-15T17:10:00  <simonstewart> Since the world isn't currently on fire, and we're aiming for a wednesday release
2011-08-15T17:10:11  <simonstewart> is it worth pushing a new version live? Or should we just wait?
2011-08-15T17:10:39  <dawagner> I don't think the 36 hours will make that much of a difference tbh
2011-08-15T17:10:45  <dawagner> Particularly with maven!
2011-08-15T17:11:10  <simonstewart> Then let's relax and put the fix in
2011-08-15T17:11:13  <dawagner> :)
2011-08-15T17:11:29  <dawagner> I'm not sure how this wasn't caught by our tests before release...
2011-08-15T17:12:58  <simonstewart> That would be a worthwhile thing to examine
2011-08-15T17:13:26  <simonstewart> Also, the default hashCode of "By" uses to String, which uses the hashCode, which uses toString which ....
2011-08-15T17:13:29  <simonstewart> We should fix that
2011-08-15T17:13:48  <dawagner> I'll give it a look after I fix the actual problem, and something that's come up in the course of fixing that :p
2011-08-15T17:13:53  <dawagner> That's... Special...
2011-08-15T17:14:13  <simonstewart> Only found that out today
2011-08-15T17:14:23  <simonstewart> Because I wrote a custom By
2011-08-15T17:16:44  <dawagner> Oh god.
2011-08-15T17:17:11  <dawagner> Encountered a bug which can only be reproduced by a cross-language cross-OS test.
2011-08-15T17:17:14  <dawagner> That's fun

2011-08-15T17:38:35  <Binken_> Is there one way for me to solve it myself?
2011-08-15T17:39:36  <simonstewart> Write a JS test in the atoms/test/ directory that demonstates the problem
2011-08-15T17:39:44  <simonstewart> Then modify the "click" atom to make it pass
2011-08-15T17:40:37  <Binken_> Click is in the action.js? right?
2011-08-15T17:40:55  <simonstewart> Right
