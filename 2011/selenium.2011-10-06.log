2011-10-06T00:03:14  <krosenvold> Good morning Ajay_
2011-10-06T00:03:15  <barancev> isTextPresent -- seems this command caused the crash. if a page is huge, it might be an issue with space normalization as it should process the whole page
2011-10-06T00:03:24  <stephend> ah
2011-10-06T00:03:39  <stephend> I know the screenshot stuff is canvas
2011-10-06T00:03:56  <stephend> I should try in chrome
2011-10-06T00:04:37  <stephend> thx barancev, that makes sense
2011-10-06T00:04:50  <stephend> also makes sense why we see it mostly in our production env. then
2011-10-06T00:04:59  <stephend> (moar data there than on staging, to be sure)

2011-10-06T00:13:59  <stephend> Ajay_: are you on 2.7.0?
2011-10-06T00:14:09  <stephend> we haven't yet switched, just curious
2011-10-06T00:14:25  <stephend> oh wow
2011-10-06T00:14:43  <stephend> you can allocate more memory to the server; I should've known that (and should try it)
2011-10-06T00:14:48  <stephend> we have to do that with Jenkins, too
2011-10-06T00:15:58  <Ajay_> stephend: yes , we are 2.7
2011-10-06T00:16:27  <stephend> cool
2011-10-06T00:16:32  <stephend> how are you liking it?
2011-10-06T00:16:35  <Ajay_> stephend: you should switch to webdriver too :)
2011-10-06T00:16:41  <stephend> Ajay_: indeed
2011-10-06T00:16:51  <stephend> we're doing that this quarter with a 105-test suite
2011-10-06T00:16:57  <stephend> maybe more, if we can get the bandwidth
2011-10-06T00:18:23  <stephend> we have no issues with our tests on sauce, and they're on 2.7.0
2011-10-06T00:18:33  <stephend> but our issues tend to be Grid issues anyway
2011-10-06T00:19:26  <Ajay_> stephend: catch hold of my mentor krosenvold
2011-10-06T00:19:52  <Ajay_> he solved most of the concurrency issues in grid
2011-10-06T00:20:17  <stephend> yeah, 2.6.0 was rock-solid for two days, for us
2011-10-06T00:20:28  <stephend> then we added screenshots, and started seeing this slow-script stuff
2011-10-06T00:20:48  <stephend> (and we had a lot of problems with 2.5.0 and below)
2011-10-06T00:28:58  <Ajay_> stephend: just adding the screenshots slowed down ?
2011-10-06T00:29:50  <stephend> Ajay_: screenshots + HTML reports
2011-10-06T00:29:58  <stephend> we're using davehunt's new plugin

2011-10-06T00:42:36  <stephend> and they're cringing :-)

2011-10-06T00:52:16  <stephend> started taking screenshots + saving html reports
2011-10-06T00:52:37  <stephend> I remember we didn't have a single session issue for 2 days with 2.6.0

2011-10-06T01:03:03  *** Renacor has quit IRC
2011-10-06T01:03:03  <stephend> I think at least one cause is that we're seeing a lot of slow-script dialogs
2011-10-06T01:03:11  <stephend> because we used is_text_present on a huge page
2011-10-06T01:03:14  <krosenvold> on get ?
2011-10-06T01:03:30  <stephend> and because we use HTML reports and screen captures, it's OOMing
2011-10-06T01:03:54  <krosenvold> The screen capture is memory intensive as hell, p your memory
2011-10-06T01:03:57  <stephend> nah, on isTextPresent("no data")
2011-10-06T01:03:57  <krosenvold> up
2011-10-06T01:04:07  <stephend> krosenvold: I just do that from the command-line, right?
2011-10-06T01:04:09  <stephend> like Jenkins
2011-10-06T01:04:12  <krosenvold> yuop
2011-10-06T01:04:14  <krosenvold> yup
2011-10-06T01:04:35  <stephend> cool, I'll try java -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.7.0.jar

2011-10-06T01:31:58  <davehunt> Yeah, thanks for the suggestion Ajay_, I'll be using it slightly differently, but still a good pointer

2011-10-06T02:43:13  <AutomatedTester> andreastt: yea we dont work on arm6
2011-10-06T02:43:32  <AutomatedTester> i was looking at our support and noticed that and was just curious
2011-10-06T02:43:38  <andreastt> [11:56] <     jgraham> | Yeah, Mozilla need ARMv7. I think we support v6 on Mobile. Mini runs on almost anything.
2011-10-06T02:44:47  <AutomatedTester> andreastt: i was asking because I wish we had a better mobile story in Africa, one that could compete with Opera
2011-10-06T02:45:11  <AutomatedTester> but google are pushing cheap arm6 devices and we dont support that :?
2011-10-06T02:45:13  <AutomatedTester> :/
2011-10-06T02:45:15  <andreastt> It would be super-awesome if you could be on those kinds of devices as well!

2011-10-06T03:10:37  <dawagner> Clicking *and* window switching?
2011-10-06T03:10:41  <jarib> yes
2011-10-06T03:10:53  <jarib> no more missing functions
2011-10-06T03:12:03  <jarib> just a couple of these

2011-10-06T03:12:03  <jarib>             got: "DoubleHello" (using ==)

2011-10-06T07:24:21  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, quit works fin on most cases, but is failing on this one, which does some switching between frames.  It's wrapped in my framework deeply, so I will try to create a simple python/webdriver script that shows it better

2011-10-06T07:35:39  <terevos> I have some questions about webdriver's interaction with selection boxes (multiple)
2011-10-06T07:35:48  <jarib> it's an enhancement, not a regression. i vote for waiting for 2.9
2011-10-06T07:36:08  <jarib> sorry davehunt :)
2011-10-06T07:36:15  <terevos> when using .click on a selection box (multiple), it doesn't simply click, it ctrl+clicks..  (adds a selection rather than replacing)..
2011-10-06T07:36:35  <terevos> so my question is:  how do you do a plain click (not clear the selection, but plain click)
2011-10-06T07:36:37  <danielwh> I'm inclined to agree... davehunt how about you release it next week? ;)
2011-10-06T07:36:47  <davehunt> jarib, danielwh: no problem
2011-10-06T07:36:51  <davehunt> the patch is here: https://gist.github.com/1267587
2011-10-06T07:37:29  <davehunt> So I should hold off committing until 2.8.0 is out?
2011-10-06T07:37:48  <lord1234> jarib, terevos is here about the pastie that we talked about last nite
2011-10-06T07:37:52  <lord1234> hi dan
2011-10-06T07:38:11  <jarib> terevos: AFAIK you'll have to clear + click, or use the advanced interactions API
2011-10-06T07:38:33  <terevos> right, I understand that there's a workaround, but I still need to test the difference between a click and ctrl+click in my application
2011-10-06T07:39:51  <jarib> terevos: then use the advanced interactions api
2011-10-06T07:39:59  <jarib> driver.action.click(element).perform
2011-10-06T07:40:03  <jarib> that'll be a plain click.
2011-10-06T07:40:11  <terevos> oh really?

2011-10-06T07:40:52  <jarib> i'm wrong
2011-10-06T07:41:42  <jarib> i wonder if that's how we intended it when click on options was changed to do ctrl+click
2011-10-06T07:42:21  <danielwh> jarib: It's a unsightly bit of API simon isn't a huge fan of, but didn't realise would be an issue with getting rid of toggle...

2011-10-06T08:18:43  <Ajay> is the 2.8 out on maven ?
2011-10-06T08:19:03  <dawagner> It's been pushed, it should take a couple of hours to arrive in central
2011-10-06T08:19:04  <jarib> terevos: updated the issue
2011-10-06T08:19:16  <Ajay> cool
2011-10-06T08:19:32  <dawagner> Thanks for all your bug fixes :) You gave me a lot of things to have to put in the changelog!
2011-10-06T08:19:57  <terevos> jarib: awesome..  thanks for the help in IDing the problem
2011-10-06T08:20:03  <jarib> np
2011-10-06T08:20:06  <Ajay> dawagner: was it for me :P
2011-10-06T08:20:32  <Ajay> berrada: hi
2011-10-06T08:21:07  <Ajay> berrada: can i run the test_android on a device directly , as emulator doesnt startup most of the times
2011-10-06T08:22:37  <Ajay> dawagner: http://seleniumhq.org/download/ still points to 2.7 ,
2011-10-06T08:23:22  <lord1234> jarib terevos and I are cut from similar cloths:-P
2011-10-06T08:23:36  <lord1234> though he was almost a man of the cloth, but thats not here nor there
2011-10-06T08:24:44  <terevos> jarib: BTW - in my experience, it's uncommon to get the kind of response you gave me from developers.

2011-10-06T09:49:09  <jarib> so e.g. updating to a newer 1.8.7 may solve it (and show you the real error :)
2011-10-06T09:49:17  <lord1234> actually i caught the issue after some more research
2011-10-06T09:49:33  <lord1234> 1.8.7 is the version, but its an error because I Was trying to start a :remote firefox, and didn't have any grid set up.....
2011-10-06T09:49:59  <jarib> right
2011-10-06T09:50:26  <jarib> in any case, upgrading ruby to a either 1.9 or a newer patchlevel of 1.8.7 is probably a good idea

2011-10-06T11:19:55  <cgoldberg> Ajay, it's "invalid certificate" error.  but I know for a fact that the host i'm trying to access has a cert that's issued to the wrong domain

2011-10-06T13:06:47  <jarib> how exactly do you instantiate the driver?
2011-10-06T13:07:18  <Dude-X> these tests work with 2.5 pretty well
2011-10-06T13:07:32  <Dude-X> 2.6, 2.7 worked okay but seemed to make other tests flaky
2011-10-06T13:08:00  <jarib> yes, this was changed for 2.8
2011-10-06T13:09:30  <Dude-X> we have a lot of elaborate code to start the driver, it checks some properties, but ultimately, we have if (isFirefox) { return new FirefoxDriver();
2011-10-06T13:09:55  <jarib> ok, so you're using the no-arg constructor
2011-10-06T13:09:57  <Dude-X> Webdriver driver = getWebDriverImplementationProperties()

2011-10-06T13:31:43  <Dude-X> i don't know. i only checked for null
2011-10-06T13:31:45  <jarib> ok
2011-10-06T13:31:48  <jarib> that's fine
2011-10-06T13:32:09  <jarib> how do you find the WebElement?
2011-10-06T13:32:14  <Dude-X> our checkstlye prohobits printing with system.err(); i can change it but it's a huge pain to change so many parts
2011-10-06T13:32:24  <jarib> np
2011-10-06T13:32:27  <Dude-X> we override click on remote web element
2011-10-06T13:33:27  <Dude-X> well, in general, we try to find an element by trying a few times up until the timeout
2011-10-06T13:33:55  <jarib> wait, you override click?
2011-10-06T13:34:16  <Dude-X> yes
2011-10-06T13:34:26  <jarib> how do you do that?
2011-10-06T13:36:42  <Dude-X> we have a class called ClickableWebElement, that will take the weblemenet object, create a new firefox webelement (FirefoxWebELement ffWe = new FirefoxWebElement((FirefoxDriver)) _driver) { @Override public void click()...
2011-10-06T13:37:10  <Dude-X> in our click we have to utlity functions that wait for the an element to become visible and then wait for a button to be enabled
2011-10-06T13:37:30  <jarib> this is probably the cause of the problem
2011-10-06T13:38:02  <jarib> wherever you instantiate the WebElement, you need to do element.setFileHandler(driver.getFileHandler())
2011-10-06T13:38:11  <jarib> or it will be null
2011-10-06T13:38:14  <Dude-X> ah
2011-10-06T13:38:17  <Dude-X> we do get the Id
2011-10-06T13:38:25  <Dude-X> and reset it
2011-10-06T13:39:03  <Dude-X> so that's the workaround to fix it?
2011-10-06T13:39:59  <jarib> well, your custom webelement is a hack
2011-10-06T13:40:10  <jarib> you can fix it by doing that
2011-10-06T13:40:19  <Dude-X> yes it's ugly. we've been using it since 2.0.0a1
2011-10-06T13:40:31  <jarib> but don't be surprised if it breaks in the future
2011-10-06T13:40:41  <Dude-X> i can take out the hack but it will be a huge pain in the ass.
2011-10-06T13:40:59  <Dude-X> i'll have to set up a sprint to do "major refactor of webdriver core"
2011-10-06T13:44:44  <jarib> better to do e.g. new OurElement(driver.findElement(...))
2011-10-06T13:45:58  <Dude-X> if i can leverage the explicit wait class better
2011-10-06T13:48:24  <Dude-X> btw you mean setFileDetector, not fileHandler right, jarib?

2011-10-06T13:58:04  <Dude-X> running now, let's see how it goes
2011-10-06T13:58:23  <ian_mac_> isn't the idea behind the JSON Wires protocol to implement a control API natively?
2011-10-06T13:58:29  <ian_mac_> as a standard?
2011-10-06T13:58:38  <ian_mac_> am I expressing that correctly?
2011-10-06T13:58:41  <Dude-X> jarib it worked!
2011-10-06T13:59:14  <Dude-X> I wanted to get rid of this class that overrides click, but I'll have to fix a lot of code :/
2011-10-06T14:00:09  <jarib> ian_mac_: the idea is to standardize the API and the SPI - not necessarily the transport (JSON/HTTP)
2011-10-06T14:00:21  <jarib> the json wire protocol is one implementation of the SPI
2011-10-06T14:00:41  <AutomatedTester> ian_mac: the interface is what we are doing, the JSON wire protocol automatically gives that browser multiple language support
2011-10-06T14:00:55  <AutomatedTester> thats just a transportation layer
2011-10-06T14:00:57  <jarib> implementors will get a lot for free if they pick that transport (e.g. multiple language clients)
2011-10-06T14:01:38  <ian_mac_> so Webdriver is the API?
2011-10-06T14:01:43  <AutomatedTester> yea
2011-10-06T14:01:46  <ian_mac_> and JSON Wires is a way to commnuicate with the API
2011-10-06T14:02:21  <AutomatedTester> for the API to communicate with the browser
2011-10-06T14:02:30  <ian_mac_> right
2011-10-06T14:03:01  <AutomatedTester> JSON is the simplest way that every browser supports
2011-10-06T14:03:20  <AutomatedTester> and there is a lot of support in many languages
2011-10-06T14:04:31  <ian_mac_> yeah
2011-10-06T14:05:07  <ian_mac_> though it seems that the RC approach was easier to develop I guess the Webdriver approach is faster

2011-10-06T15:25:05  <mastert14> It involves Bromine on Red Hat, running from another computer and timing out after 120 seconds. I think it's because Bromine can't open the browser, but not sure. Figured I'd start with this debug info.

2011-10-06T17:26:07  <simonstewart> option 2, in particular
2011-10-06T17:26:35  <jarib> i read that
2011-10-06T17:26:45  <jarib> i don't get why the client can't just talk the remote debugging protocol directly
2011-10-06T17:27:16  <jarib> and by client, i mean the thing running outside the device
2011-10-06T17:27:18  <simonstewart> Imagine you're on a mobile phone network....
2011-10-06T17:27:43  <simonstewart> the telcos don't make it easy to connect to the device
2011-10-06T17:28:08  <simonstewart> (proxies in the way, in determinate IP address on a private network)
2011-10-06T17:28:12  <simonstewart> (shitty latency)
2011-10-06T17:28:27  <simonstewart> The device, OTOH, _must_ be able to reach public addresses
2011-10-06T17:28:43  <simonstewart> (how else are you going to be able to browse porn with your iphone?)
2011-10-06T17:28:53  <jarib> that is true
2011-10-06T17:29:00  <simonstewart> It might also make it easier to implement the safari driver
2011-10-06T17:30:08  <simonstewart> And, let's not forget, it's a fun thing to play with :)
2011-10-06T17:30:14  <jarib> hehe
2011-10-06T17:31:19  <jarib> i don't get how you're going to get the device to initiate the connection though
2011-10-06T17:31:29  <jarib> unless you're manually clicking the phone
2011-10-06T17:31:32  <simonstewart> An XmlHttpRequest from an extension
2011-10-06T17:31:47  <simonstewart> You'll probably need to manually activate the driver
2011-10-06T17:31:57  <simonstewart> From a developer menu, I guess
2011-10-06T17:32:04  <simonstewart> But that's a UI problem
2011-10-06T17:32:05  <simonstewart> :)

2011-10-06T17:34:15  <simonstewart> About to fire up the Firefox 9 nightly to see how badly webdriver breaks on it
2011-10-06T17:34:57  <simonstewart> And tackle the thorny problem of how to make a JS XPCOM component thread safe
2011-10-06T17:35:00  <simonstewart> How hard can it be?
2011-10-06T17:36:17  <jarib> theoretically, it could be impossible
2011-10-06T17:37:29  <jarib> it could also be very easy, of course
2011-10-06T17:40:31  *** cerberos has quit IRC
2011-10-06T17:42:00  <simonstewart> One way to find out
2011-10-06T17:44:28  <jarib> why does it need to be thread safe?
2011-10-06T17:46:39  <jarib> i thought it was all single-threaded
2011-10-06T17:48:12  <simonstewart> nsIClassInfo.THREADSAFE
2011-10-06T17:48:15  <simonstewart> that looks useful

2011-10-06T18:36:23  <jarib> then realized i had put in a 15 second sleep
