2011-09-13T00:24:25  <barancev|2> solofight: you have to check them one by one, either use IDE FlowControl plugin (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flow-control/), or switch to selenium api (IDE can generate a draft of the script, but you'll have to rework it to add a loop)

2011-09-13T02:36:02  <eranm> you were looking for me?
2011-09-13T02:36:10  <krosenvold_> Yup, did you see my mail on the ml ?
2011-09-13T02:36:20  *** solofight_ has joined #selenium
2011-09-13T02:36:36  <krosenvold_> The question is simply; "What can cause respond.send() not to come back to the client ?"
2011-09-13T02:37:36  <eranm> Do you see the response being sent?
2011-09-13T02:37:54  <eranm> I can think of several cases where we wait for a load event (in the Firefox driver, specifically) and then send the response
2011-09-13T02:37:59  <krosenvold_> With log statements I ensured I arrived at line 1189
2011-09-13T02:38:13  <krosenvold_> In utils.js
2011-09-13T02:38:22  <eranm> so if we miss the load event the response will not be sent
2011-09-13T02:38:51  <krosenvold_> But that should be covered by checkForLoad on line 1194 ?
2011-09-13T02:39:04  <krosenvold_> But we actually /arrive/ on line 1189
2011-09-13T02:39:33  <krosenvold_> Which would somehow make me think there is some relationship between session.setWindow or similar that I dont understand

2011-09-13T03:05:42  <eranm> krosenvold_, you don't get to installClickListener from get - however, you do get to the WebLoadingListener. See line 75 in firefoxDriver.js
2011-09-13T03:06:46  <krosenvold_> eranm: That is the odd thing; I spent a /bunch/ of time instrumenting the function on firefoxdriver line 98

2011-09-13T04:33:23  <bracki> ah, I had assumed that webdriver's logger would redirect all console entries to webdriver.log.file. This isn't the case.
2011-09-13T04:34:00  <bracki> Is it possible to add some JavaScript extension when launching webdriver, that would implement said redirection?
2011-09-13T04:35:01  <adamgoucher> barancev|2: which what needs an update?
2011-09-13T04:37:15  <simonstewart> You can tell I don't do much pairing these days.
2011-09-13T04:37:20  <simonstewart> That was a lovely egg sandwich
2011-09-13T04:37:39  <simonstewart> We use normal java.util.logging in the server
2011-09-13T04:37:49  <simonstewart> So just configure that as you would any other java process
2011-09-13T04:37:51  <simonstewart> and you're away
2011-09-13T04:38:59  <simonstewart> Does ./go javadocs crash for anyone else?
2011-09-13T04:39:06  <bracki> simonstewart: did you mean me?
2011-09-13T04:39:16  <simonstewart> bracki: yes
2011-09-13T04:39:28  <freynaud> simonstewart: i think the javadoc is completly missing for grid

2011-09-13T04:40:17  <simonstewart> It probably is
2011-09-13T04:42:14  <bracki> What IÄ'm actually looking for is a "conse" object replacement that allows client JavaScript logging to appear in the webdriver.log.file.
2011-09-13T04:42:30  <freynaud> simonstewart: most of the javadoc is irrelevant for users, but trunk/java/server/src/org/openqa/grid/internal/listeners should be published ideally
2011-09-13T04:42:38  <simonstewart> k
2011-09-13T04:42:40  <simonstewart> Good to know
2011-09-13T04:42:45  <bracki> I don't see any java.util.logging involved their. I'm using selenium-webdriver/watir-webdriver.
2011-09-13T04:42:58  <simonstewart> Although, since the javadoc doesn't compile right now, it's less of a problem than it might be.

2011-09-13T04:43:38  <freynaud> simonstewart: it's a feature.
2011-09-13T04:43:55  <freynaud> simonstewart: that + the poor documentation strategy allows great refactoring
2011-09-13T04:43:56  <simonstewart> heh
2011-09-13T04:45:39  <bracki> So actually I want to extend "logging.js" that comes packaged in the webdriver.xpi. How would I do that? Unpack and repackage or is there an extension point for "customer" scripts?
2011-09-13T04:46:00  <simonstewart> There's no extension point for additional logging built in
2011-09-13T04:46:14  <simonstewart> Though anything that appears in the Error Console can already be written to a file
2011-09-13T04:46:36  <bracki> Then I'm missing the point how to do it.
2011-09-13T04:46:50  <bracki> Just setting "webdriver.log.file" isn't sufficient.
2011-09-13T04:47:01  <bracki> That only logs webdriver interna.
2011-09-13T04:47:12  <simonstewart> Hang on. I'll find the incantation
2011-09-13T04:49:13  <simonstewart> Ah yes
2011-09-13T04:49:23  <simonstewart> Set the "webdriver.log.file" preference on the FirefoxProfile
2011-09-13T04:49:32  <bracki> I already did that
2011-09-13T04:49:45  <simonstewart> It adds a new console appender

2011-09-13T04:50:34  <bracki> No, only the webdriver internal logging ends up their. Anything else that uses the consoleservice still ends up in the console

2011-09-13T05:07:09  <Parabola> thats all classes minus my runner, which is just the main method, and it starts testRunner in TestExecutor
2011-09-13T05:08:04  <eranm> krosenvold_, canceling the timer would be a good idea. Regardless, there's no harm in this race condition - at most, the inner loop will end prematurely.
2011-09-13T05:08:59  <eranm> The conditions for termination of the outer while loop are preserved - either there are no more native events or the page was unloaded.
2011-09-13T05:09:49  <bracki> jarib: btw that only works with FF3.6 but not with FF6
2011-09-13T05:10:08  <eranm> But do go ahead and cancel the timer - canceling it will prevent spurious "Done native event wait" messages appearing in the Firefox console (and I've seen several)

2011-09-13T06:39:26  <jimevans> Parabola: you could, but the browser name is pretty specific and unforgiving if you get it wrong, which is why we provide the static functions to pre-fill the capabilities object.

2011-09-13T06:43:07  <jimevans> Parabola: yes, like DesiredCapabilities.InternetExplorer(). it prefills the browser name with the correct string for IE.
2011-09-13T06:43:18  <jimevans> .Firefox() does similarly for Firefox, and so on.
2011-09-13T06:43:32  <krosenvold_> There really is no point in rebasing for concurrency heisenbugs since they really only ever point to some meaningless commit that changed the timing enough to make the problem appear

2011-09-13T06:45:00  <Parabola> jimevans: the Reason I ask, is I'd love to dump my logic that I have here to set browser
2011-09-13T06:45:32  <Parabola> jimevans: if (browser.equalsIgnoreCase("ie")) { capability = DesiredCapabilities.internetExplorer(); }
2011-09-13T06:45:59  <Parabola> then i pass in version for setVersion
2011-09-13T06:46:03  <simonstewart> krosenvold_: ok. I'll not consider it a blocker either
2011-09-13T06:46:38  <Parabola> jimevans: are the Strings that are required for setBrowerName availible?
2011-09-13T06:46:43  <Parabola> I'd like to use thoes

2011-09-13T06:47:21  *** nirvdrum has quit IRC
2011-09-13T06:47:23  <Parabola> ..
2011-09-13T06:47:34  <Parabola> someone must know what they are
2011-09-13T06:47:45  <jimevans> oh, you could browser the source code and find them.
2011-09-13T06:47:47  <Parabola> or you couldnt have statically coded the functions
2011-09-13T06:47:58  <wislem> does anyone know how to dismiss a header alert?  I am kind of stuck here...  It seems firefox driver is stuck trying to load the page, and does not recognize there is an alert it needs to dismiss.
2011-09-13T06:48:12  <jimevans> for example, the one for IE is "internet explorer" (two words, no caps)
2011-09-13T06:48:22  <Parabola> Sweet
2011-09-13T06:48:40  <simonstewart> wislem: driver.switchTo().alert().dismiss();
2011-09-13T06:49:02  <wislem> simonstewart I have that in the code, but it never reaches that code
2011-09-13T06:49:04  <jimevans> Parabola: but it's an internal implementation detail in the DesiredCapabilities class, which means we reserve the right to change it without telling anyone.
2011-09-13T06:49:15  <wislem> it gets stuck in open(URL)
2011-09-13T06:49:39  <simonstewart> ok. How far does it get?
2011-09-13T06:49:45  <Parabola> jimevans: i understand
2011-09-13T06:49:47  <Parabola> adsfas
2011-09-13T06:50:15  <wislem> simonstewart: the html page has a <head><script>alert("some alert:)</script></head><body>...
2011-09-13T06:51:32  <wislem> simonstewart: so the driver gets as far as driver.open(URL); where it blocks (firefox reports transferring data...), but the alert has popped up, even though my next instruction is driver.switchT0().alert().accept();
2011-09-13T06:51:42  <jimevans> Parabola: you can see the source for the DesiredCapabilities class at http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/DesiredCapabilities.java
2011-09-13T06:52:30  <wislem> *driver.get(URL) not open, my typo

2011-09-13T08:05:49  <ImthePC> Excellent. The IE Modal fix you were working on with Cheezy works perfectly. It opens the first modal, then the second modal from within the first, and closes both without issue. Cheezy asked me to let you know.
2011-09-13T08:06:10  <jimevans> well, that's good news, then.
2011-09-13T08:06:22  <ImthePC> Absolutely. Thanks for all the assistance, it's been a great help! :)

2011-09-13T10:17:54  <krosenvold_> Can you explain to me how "get" manages to print the "New page loading" message ?
2011-09-13T10:18:02  <simonstewart> Ahhh... okay

2011-09-13T10:18:56  * simonstewart twiddles thumbs
2011-09-13T10:19:03  * simonstewart isn't really patient
2011-09-13T10:19:18  <krosenvold_> The only thing I can think of is this: The previous event (like getElementAttribute) uses a setTimeout of sorts that actually responds upon processing of the subsequent command
2011-09-13T10:19:36  <krosenvold_> It /would/ be possible to race that way, wouldn't it ?
2011-09-13T10:19:39  <simonstewart> OK. so we start in firefoxdriver.js
2011-09-13T10:19:47  <simonstewart> line 75
2011-09-13T10:20:06  <krosenvold_> Yes ;)
2011-09-13T10:20:20  <simonstewart> we do some checking to see if we expect a load event
2011-09-13T10:20:35  <simonstewart> And if we expect one, we create a new WebLoadingListener
2011-09-13T10:20:35  <krosenvold_> Gotta put kids to bed, back in 20. I've read that method about 1 zillion times
2011-09-13T10:20:53  <simonstewart> (I'm walking through it too: not been here for a while)
2011-09-13T10:21:06  <krosenvold_> Second pair of eyes appreciated
2011-09-13T10:21:08  <simonstewart> So, the web loading listener is handy
2011-09-13T10:21:29  <simonstewart> And keeps a reference to the "respond" method to use

2011-09-13T10:26:57  <simonstewart> krosenvold_: now, when we call "respond.send()" the method (by default) replaces itself with a no-o

2011-09-13T10:40:41  <simonstewart> yes
2011-09-13T10:40:50  <simonstewart> the double click registered a click listener

2011-09-13T10:41:22  <simonstewart> but a page load isn't seen, so double click returns normally (killing the respond.send() function used by the click listener)
2011-09-13T10:41:41  <simonstewart> You do a "get" and the click listener (now neutered) notices the page load and logs it
2011-09-13T10:41:53  <simonstewart> before calling it's (now no-op) respond.send method

2011-09-13T10:57:42  <andrei1> the click doesnt work all the time, so the best workaround I have found was to use fireEvent which is only in Selenium class
2011-09-13T10:57:52  *** AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
2011-09-13T10:57:57  <jarib> pigletto: that sounds like something we fixed a while back
2011-09-13T10:58:25  <pigletto> jarib: ok, good to hear that
2011-09-13T10:58:29  <andrei1> I just want something simmilar to selenium.fireEvent in WebDriver
2011-09-13T10:58:40  <jimevans> andrei1: it doesn't exist. sorry.
2011-09-13T10:59:06  <jimevans> if click() doesn't work for you, we should figure out why.
2011-09-13T10:59:55  <andrei1> well click stops working when I try to click on other window or click somewhere inside the browser
2011-09-13T11:00:16  <andrei1> inside the page
2011-09-13T11:00:54  <adamiscranky> so if i'm going to modify someone else's github project, i need to fork not clone it. correct?
2011-09-13T11:01:16  <jarib> adamiscranky: clone it so you have a local working copy, when you're ready to push, fork it on github
2011-09-13T11:01:28  <jarib> then push to your fork.
2011-09-13T11:01:51  <jimevans> andrei1: you want to click on an arbitrary location in the page? or on a specific element? i'm not following what you mean by "stops working"
2011-09-13T11:02:11  <pigletto> I suppose that there should be 2.6: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py/selenium/__init__.py
2011-09-13T11:02:12  <adamiscranky> jarib: i know that looks like you were speaking english, but it wasnt :D
2011-09-13T11:03:34  <andrei1> ok, I want to click on some WebElement on the page from selenium, but if before that I click(not from selenium, manual) somewhere inside the page the click(selenium click) doesn't work after that
2011-09-13T11:03:34  <jarib> adamiscranky: `git clone <url to repo>` -> hack hack hack -> push "fork" on github -> `git push <url to your fork> master`
2011-09-13T11:04:12  <adamiscranky> jarib: much more english like. thanks. :)
2011-09-13T11:05:23  <Ajay> @admiscranky: http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/
2011-09-13T11:05:45  <jimevans> andrei1: i'm having trouble visualizing what you mean. is there a public url with a page that demonstrates the problem?
2011-09-13T11:06:30  <jarib> eranm: that doubleclick problem applies to native events on linux as well
2011-09-13T11:06:35  <jimevans> (leaving aside the question of why you're clicking on the page while your test is running)
2011-09-13T11:06:44  <andrei1> srry, I am in a company on a private network, I will try to explain it better
2011-09-13T11:06:57  <Binken_> Jim, what's the difference between net4.0 and net3.5 bing for selenium?
2011-09-13T11:08:49  <adamiscranky> hah. just realized the bindings i am going to use are on svn not git (thanks though)
2011-09-13T11:09:28  <andrei1> so, I have a page on which I have a WebElement(a kind of comboButton), when I run the test, if I click on that page manually somewhere(not on that element), and after that execute WebElement.click it doesn't work
2011-09-13T11:09:30  <jimevans> Binken_: none, except for the assemblies it has references to.
2011-09-13T11:09:50  <Binken_> ok, understand
2011-09-13T11:09:59  <Binken_> Jim, the interesting thing for #2011
2011-09-13T11:10:00  <selbot2_>  open/new Select Element do not fire Click event When do the selection - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2011 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium]
2011-09-13T11:10:03  <andrei1> I mean the WebElement.click doesn't trigger anything
2011-09-13T11:10:13  <Binken_> is that it works by using the native click
2011-09-13T11:10:14  <jimevans> andrei1: does it happen on all broswers? or just certain ones?
2011-09-13T11:10:19  <Binken_> not the click action
2011-09-13T11:10:25  <Binken_> for the elment
2011-09-13T11:10:27  <andrei1> IE and firefox
2011-09-13T11:10:41  <andrei1> but the Selenium.fireEvent works
2011-09-13T11:10:57  <andrei1> so I am trying to implement clicking based on that
2011-09-13T11:11:42  <Ajay> lukeis: hey
2011-09-13T11:11:50  <andrei1> like fireEvent("xpath", "mouseover") and fireEvent("xpath", "click")
2011-09-13T11:11:53  <lukeis> hey Ajay
2011-09-13T11:12:36  <jimevans> andrei1: i'm not going to speak to how to call a "fireEvent" method. it doesn't exist in the webdriver api, and probably isn't going to. if somebody else wants to step in and work with that, they're welcome to.
2011-09-13T11:13:16  <jimevans> but it sounds like the element you're working with is from a javascript library, like jquery or extjs or the like.
2011-09-13T11:13:40  <andrei1> yeah maybe
2011-09-13T11:14:40  <andrei1> ok, thanks anyway, its just its easier to work with WebDriver's WebElement then to do all in xpath and use Selenium.fireEvent
2011-09-13T11:14:51  <adamiscranky> is /speed officially part of the wire protocol?
2011-09-13T11:15:20  <andrei1> would be nice to have a fireEvent in WebElement class
2011-09-13T11:15:24  <Ajay> :wiki JSONwireprotocol
2011-09-13T11:15:25  <selbot2_> 1: JsonWireProtocol: A description of the protocol used by WebDriver to communicate with remote instances - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol
2011-09-13T11:15:40  <jimevans> andrei1: i'm happy to help figure out why the native event mouse clicks don't work for you, but i'd need a sample page to test against to debug it.
2011-09-13T11:15:52  <adamiscranky> Ajay: if it was there i wouldnt ask in here :)
2011-09-13T11:16:38  <jimevans> andrei1: fireEvent probably isn't going to happen. a user will never fire an event directly on an element. the event will only fire in response to a user interaction like clicks or keystrokes.
2011-09-13T11:16:40  <Ajay> @adamiscranky: No offences i just fired up i havent g
2011-09-13T11:16:59  <jimevans> and the webdriver api concentrates on emulating a user's actions.
2011-09-13T11:17:00  <Ajay> gone through the protocol for few days :)
2011-09-13T11:17:07  <andrei1> ok, I dont think I can give you access to the company network, but I will try to go some webpage and see if I can reproduce the problem
2011-09-13T11:17:28  <jimevans> adamiscranky: i thought we'd removed /speed. it was removed from the API awhile back.

2011-09-13T11:18:06  <andrei1> I will try to do it now, if you will be here I will let you know if it works or not
2011-09-13T11:18:16  <jimevans> it would've been before 2.0 final shipped.
2011-09-13T11:19:24  <jimevans> it got removed before the deprecation of RenderedWebElement and the removal of select() and toggle()
2011-09-13T11:21:29  <Ajay> lukeis: a patch for document on gist allowed :)

2011-09-13T11:21:42  <simonstewart> speed went years ago in webdriver
2011-09-13T11:21:52  <jimevans> speed was deprecated in the .NET bindings in March of 2011, and was removed in June.

2011-09-13T11:46:57  <Nogem> anybody have experience with predicting window handles?
2011-09-13T11:47:22  <jimevans> Nogem: predicting window handles? how so?
2011-09-13T11:47:29  <jimevans> and why?
2011-09-13T11:47:59  <Nogem> in a situation that to check the state of something I'm waiting on requires a link click that launches a new window
2011-09-13T11:47:59  <simonstewart> G'night all
2011-09-13T11:48:02  *** simonstewart has left #selenium
2011-09-13T11:48:22  <adamiscranky> so if you maintained a language binding and it would out of sync with the json protocol, would you want one massive patch, or many smaller patches
2011-09-13T11:48:28  <Nogem> so the ideal would be verify values on the new window, close it, and continue
2011-09-13T11:48:35  <jimevans> yeah, you won't be able to predict those for firefox or ie.
2011-09-13T11:49:02  <Nogem> yeah....{aa1a8d38-c483-4ffd-a4b3-89f504c12a35} doesn't look all that predictable
2011-09-13T11:49:06  <jimevans> the window handles for those browsers are uuids (or guids if you prefer)
2011-09-13T11:50:00  <jimevans> and are inherently random.
2011-09-13T11:50:03  <Nogem> that makes it kind of hard to even find the right window to check
2011-09-13T11:50:35  <Nogem> guessing the next best option is to switch windows and check for the presence of something unique in the current window?
2011-09-13T11:50:39  * jimevans needs to write that method in the .NET support classes that will find a new window handle.
2011-09-13T11:51:45  <jimevans> (assuming java code) what i would do is call driver.getWindowHandles() before invoking the popup, invoke the popup, call driver.getWindowHandles() again, and see which handle is new in the returned list.

2011-09-13T13:21:02  <lord1234> i see
2011-09-13T13:21:17  <jarib> but i assume you know when a new window pops up
2011-09-13T13:22:54  <jarib> so e.g. original_handles = driver.window_handles; ... some action that opens a window ...; new_handles = driver.window_handles - original_handles

2011-09-13T13:23:54  <testnick> Hello
2011-09-13T13:24:11  <jimevans> jarib: did you implement a select element helper class in the ruby bindings?
2011-09-13T13:24:16  <jimevans> a la the support class?
2011-09-13T13:25:28  <jarib> jimevans: no. samit wrote one but haven't committed
2011-09-13T13:25:40  <jimevans> ok. just asking.
2011-09-13T13:26:05  <jimevans> i didn't know if the ruby bindings had support classes like java and .net.
2011-09-13T13:26:27  <jarib> not yet
2011-09-13T13:26:53  <jimevans> i have a "click this element and return the resulting popup's window handle" class i'm considering for the .net bindings.
2011-09-13T13:26:58  <jarib> well, i have the EventFiringWebDriver stuff
2011-09-13T13:27:04  <testnick> Hello... I am doing waitForCondition('selenium.browserbot.getUserWindow().xRequestQueue.queue.length == 0')... but sometimes it complains that s.b.g().xRequestQueue is not defined...
2011-09-13T13:27:31  <testnick> So I did a waitForCondition() before that, where I test if it is defined.
2011-09-13T13:27:32  <testnick> but that doesn't work. Any advice?

2011-09-13T13:28:57  <jarib> jimevans: i tend to stick to watir-webdriver's lazy-located Window class - e.g. browser.window(:title => "foo").when_present.use

2011-09-13T13:29:31  <testnick> jimevans why would you be tempted to give flippant advice?
2011-09-13T13:29:34  <testnick> is that a character flaw?
2011-09-13T13:29:34  <jimevans> jarib: well, .net users don't have the luxury of a fully-developed watir-like api.
2011-09-13T13:29:37  <lord1234> also, check out the list of selenium developers, before you piss any of them off....
2011-09-13T13:29:58  <jimevans> testnick: no, i just hate selenium rc with a passion, and it looks like you're using selenium rc. :)
2011-09-13T13:30:02  <testnick> Copy that.
2011-09-13T13:30:06  <jarib> jimevans: right. seems like a useful addition
2011-09-13T13:30:06  <jimevans> i strongly prefer selenium webdriver.
