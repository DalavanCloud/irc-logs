2011-06-07T00:06:49  <barancev> sdio: do you need documentation? (I bet you can find it :))
2011-06-07T00:07:42  <barancev> sdio: you can get sorce code from svn, there is VS2008 project inside cpp\IEDriver\
2011-06-07T00:10:48  <sdio> barancev: I've looked through the docs, but they reference an earlier version of IEDriver, IEDriver itself references the json lib + mongoose.
2011-06-07T00:11:14  <sdio> Going through the source, IEDriverServer seems to be the main "entrypoint" as it were.
2011-06-07T00:11:45  <sdio> Just trying to figure out what the best way to rip all the unnecessary stuff out is.
2011-06-07T00:12:25  <barancev> sdio: json and mongoose are in source tree too - in third_party folder
2011-06-07T00:12:38  <barancev> third_party\json-cpp\
2011-06-07T00:12:48  <barancev> third_party\mongoose\
2011-06-07T00:12:58  <sdio> barancev: indeed, but they're un-necessary if I want to access the browser itself directly from C++, and not go through the server, yes?

2011-06-07T00:16:15  <barancev> sdio: especially the last paragraph about IEDriver (makeing it a server is the preferred way that makes it look like other drivers)
2011-06-07T00:22:51  <sdio> barancev: I understand the reasons for the decision, I just don't want the added overhead in my case (screen scraping).
2011-06-07T00:23:44  <sdio> barancev: I guess the easiest solution will be rolling back to a much older version of IEDriver that didn't use the http server model, and using that.

2011-06-07T04:49:58  <wilhelm> simonstewart: I saw you talked to Mike Smith about the testing group at W3C. The first step of our plan for the group is to abduct test managers (or other decision makers on testing) from each browser vendor, lock them in a room and not let them out again until they agree on the basics of how we should write cross-browser test suites for web standards at the W3C.
2011-06-07T04:50:17  <wilhelm> Several browser vendors already use tools from Selenium-land, but I think we all write in different languages. |c:
2011-06-07T04:50:36  <simonstewart> Indeed
2011-06-07T04:50:51  <simonstewart> The nice thing about the webdriver apis is that they already support the commonly used languages
2011-06-07T04:50:58  <simonstewart> (c#, java, python and ruby)
2011-06-07T04:51:17  <simonstewart> My understanding is that this covers most of the languages used by browers vendors
2011-06-07T04:51:40  <simonstewart> (Chrome and Firefox == python, Opera == ruby. Presumably IE == C#)
2011-06-07T04:51:49  <wilhelm> If you're interested, you're very welcome to join the meeting. It'll most likely be at the Google HQ sometime during this summer.

2011-06-07T04:52:13  <simonstewart> I'll email the SIG today with a proposal to adopt webdriver

2011-06-07T04:53:26  <simonstewart> (should have said IG)
2011-06-07T04:53:37  <wilhelm> Ah, excellent.
2011-06-07T04:54:03  <simonstewart> One nice thing is that webdriver's already being adopted, so hopefully things will be simpler
2011-06-07T04:54:48  <simonstewart> Ahhh... http://www.w3.org/web-testing/ig/#join

2011-06-07T05:00:50  <wilhelm> simonstewart: What are your goals for standardization of the WebDriver API? A rough consensus between browser vendors or a W3C Recommendation (or similar)?
2011-06-07T05:01:48  <simonstewart> The end-goal is to have a clear standard for browser automation
2011-06-07T05:02:05  <simonstewart> So a W3C Recommendation (or similar)
2011-06-07T05:02:42  <simonstewart> The benefit would be both to web developers and to standards bodies attempting to express how a browser should behave
2011-06-07T05:02:53  <ato> simonstewart: Have you spoken to wilhelm?
2011-06-07T05:03:05  <simonstewart> ato: Speaking now :)

2011-06-07T05:11:38  <wilhelm> simonstewart: I'll be contacting representatives from all the browser vendors this and next week. We need to find a suitable date to meet this summer. And then we take it from there. The charter currently doesn't say anything about us writing recommendation-track specifications, so if we do reach some sort of consensus, we need to talk to Mike to see which bureaucratic hoops we need to jump through to get W3C's stamp on a WebDriver spec.
2011-06-07T05:11:56  <simonstewart> sounds good to me
2011-06-07T05:12:22  <simonstewart> Getting consensus first is probably a wise move
2011-06-07T05:13:54  <wilhelm> I suggest you just start writing that spec, though. “Look, we have a rough draft already! And two volunteer editors!” is more convincing to W3C management than “Well, we want to write this spec…”. (c;

2011-06-07T06:25:14  <eranm> right here, so people can chime in if they have strong feelings about an issue / fix
2011-06-07T06:25:49  <Mayank> simonstewart: yeah thats what! but when I use - window.alert = null; selenium detecs the alert throws an error - unexpected alert and tests fails. If I use - assertAlert or verifyAlert , window.alert = null does not seem to work, and the errors that is thrown is - there was no alert.
2011-06-07T06:25:54  <Mayank> AutomatedTester: ^
2011-06-07T06:26:13  <Mayank> anyway I could make Selenium to stop detecting alerts altogether?
2011-06-07T06:26:19  <AutomatedTester> Mayank: because both you and Selenium are trying to overload the alert
2011-06-07T06:26:28  <AutomatedTester> and Selenium is winning the race
2011-06-07T06:26:30  <barancev> #1754
2011-06-07T06:26:31  <selbot2>  open/new Actions Class is not working with PageObjects in selenium 2.0c2 - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1754
2011-06-07T06:26:43  <barancev> I've created a patch, it is attached to the issue
2011-06-07T06:27:40  <ner0x> simonstewart: Where can I find the source?
2011-06-07T06:27:42  <Mayank> AutomatedTester: yeah! So anyway out of it? If I could some how change the code somewhere so that selenium stops detecting alets?
2011-06-07T06:28:08  <ner0x> Also, I'm unsure the difference between Selenium 1 and 2. I test in perl.
2011-06-07T06:28:11  <AutomatedTester> Mayank: you will need to go into Selenium-api.js and remove the alert code
2011-06-07T06:28:32  <eranm> barancev, looks good - I'll see how it can be tested and apply it
2011-06-07T06:28:39  <AutomatedTester> Mayank: is there not a better way to tell the user there is an error than an onLoad alert?
2011-06-07T06:29:28  <Mayank> AutomatedTester: I am testing SCORM packages, they have an alert after each SCO is loaded!
2011-06-07T06:29:41  <Mayank> or on onLoad I should say

2011-06-07T06:29:59  <AutomatedTester> imho Alerts should only be used if there is an error
2011-06-07T06:30:22  <Mayank> AutomatedTester: yeah! I totally agree with you.

2011-06-07T07:59:03  <jarib> (since we override its certificate handling if acceptUntrustedCertificates is true, which is the default)
2011-06-07T07:59:14  <jarib> Jemboh: really, you should try to figure out why it's not working out of the box and file a bug.

2011-06-07T08:32:08  <XCulver> \svg might work too
2011-06-07T08:32:23  <polm> No, those are forward slashes

2011-06-07T08:34:00  <simonstewart> I assume that the chrome and chromium version numbers match
2011-06-07T08:34:05  <polm> I *think* that's what xpath is supposed to be good for

2011-06-07T10:00:57  <jleyba> To test against Chromium, you'll need to actually build from source

2011-06-07T10:06:14  <jleyba> The API should be finalized before 2.0final

2011-06-07T10:07:42  <jleyba> btw, I've been meaning to write an email about this, but I'll just throw it out there...how do people feel about removing webelement.setSelected(), toggle(), and submit()?
2011-06-07T10:08:01  <polm> Oh my.
2011-06-07T10:08:01  <simonstewart> toggle I'm fine with
2011-06-07T10:08:15  <simonstewart> submit is useful in some cases
2011-06-07T10:08:18  <simonstewart> setSelected?
2011-06-07T10:08:21  <jleyba> they all break our model of modeling the user
2011-06-07T10:08:26  <polm> What's the alternative to submit? click?
2011-06-07T10:08:38  <simonstewart> click or sendKeys("\n")
2011-06-07T10:08:38  <autojack> I've been using find_element().displayed?.should be_true for my rspec tests. are there any other methods I should look at for verification?
2011-06-07T10:08:58  <simonstewart> A user sets elements selected
2011-06-07T10:09:07  <simonstewart> "select that checkbox there"
2011-06-07T10:09:14  <simonstewart> "select that item from the drop down"
2011-06-07T10:09:18  <jleyba> setSelected breaks the user model: we set the selected state directly and fire a change event.  the selection should be done through a mouse or keyboard action
2011-06-07T10:09:24  <jarib> autojack: element.should be_displayed is the nice rspec magic for that
2011-06-07T10:09:34  <simonstewart> jleyba: yeah, we can improve the implementation
2011-06-07T10:09:36  <jleyba> there's a difference b/w the verbs describing a use case and what is actually done
2011-06-07T10:09:43  <simonstewart> ^^
2011-06-07T10:10:03  <simonstewart> BTW, should I add http://code.google.com/p/php-webdriver-bindings/ to the front page as a related project?
2011-06-07T10:10:07  <jarib> autojack: other methods - just check the Element class in the docs for anything that looks useful to you
2011-06-07T10:10:13  <autojack> jarib: ah, that's cool.
2011-06-07T10:10:17  <jarib> autojack: depends on what you want to do, really
2011-06-07T10:10:17  <autojack> yeah I didn't really see anything else.
2011-06-07T10:10:41  <jleyba> simonstewart: i don't see why not. there's a surprising amount of interest in php bindings
2011-06-07T10:10:54  <autojack> "should be displayed" seems most useful. the other thing I used to do was assert that text should be present.
2011-06-07T10:10:58  <simonstewart> Indeed. PHP's still very popular
2011-06-07T10:13:34  <jimevans> there's a shocking amount of duplication of effort between c++ implementations of the server side of the json wire protocol.
2011-06-07T10:14:01  <jleyba> jimevans: yup
2011-06-07T10:15:06  <jimevans> i've no idea how to reconcile that, mind you, but i do spend time thinking about it.
2011-06-07T10:15:15  <jleyba> chromium's version needs some cleaning up, but it works, so everyone's jsut been leaving it alone :)

2011-06-07T10:17:42  <simonstewart> I'm fine with removing toggle, can be persuaded about setSelected, but would prefer to keep submit()
2011-06-07T10:21:57  <rpk> are there cases where submit won't perform correctly?
2011-06-07T10:22:16  <simonstewart> several: right now the implementation is almost universally suboptimal
2011-06-07T10:22:30  <rpk> and +1 remove toggle and setSelected, click is a better natural choice and will make the api easier to learn
2011-06-07T10:22:54  <simonstewart> Ideally we'd walk up the DOM, find the form element, then back down the DOM to find the place which would cause the form to be submitted before actually performing the "correct" action

2011-06-07T10:23:34  <rpk> simonstewart: yeah, I guess that would be my problem with it, calling submit in my gwt sample app didn't work to login

2011-06-07T10:23:53  <simonstewart> Bloody JS
2011-06-07T10:24:20  <jleyba> example: a div with a click handler that triggers the submit
2011-06-07T10:24:24  <rpk> jleyba: thats why I wouldn't mind if it were removed, its too hard to guarantee correct behavior, but it looks (from a user of the api) as the correct method to use
2011-06-07T10:24:38  <rpk> jleyba: yes, my gwt demo had a very similar case IIRC
2011-06-07T10:24:55  <simonstewart> We'd be looking for the elements that cause a form to be submitted
2011-06-07T10:25:08  <simonstewart> button, input submit, input image
2011-06-07T10:25:36  <rpk> simonstewart: the alternative is to force them to add an id, and then call click.  I don't think thats unreasonable
2011-06-07T10:25:56  <simonstewart> heh. The number of arguments I've had about adding ids....
2011-06-07T10:25:58  <rpk> (by id I mean discernable identifier, not necessarily an id tag)
2011-06-07T10:26:07  <jleyba> Shoudl submit handle the simple case and throw an error if it can't identify the correct element to use?
2011-06-07T10:26:10  <simonstewart> it's not unreasonable to ask, but teams hate making their lives easy

2011-06-07T13:24:23  <L4nce0> so I have an issue where I need selenium to save either the whole session, or the javascript cookies. it's a bit annoying, but if it doesn't have this cookie, I have to do a account recovery
2011-06-07T13:25:25  <tunabum> L4nce0: can you not just get the eval of javascript document.cookie ?
2011-06-07T13:26:37  <L4nce0> tunabum, I'm not really that familiar with javascript cookies. When I was no HTML unit I just serilised the browser and reread it. How would I look into what you're talking about?
2011-06-07T13:28:17  *** santiycr has quit IRC
2011-06-07T13:28:45  <tunabum> L4nce0: String cookies = selenium.getEval("this.browserbot.getUserWindow().document.cookie");
2011-06-07T13:29:26  <tunabum> L4nce0: you can use firebug or chrome to see what that string will look like
2011-06-07T13:33:36  <L4nce0> okay, and I'll just save the cookies, and read them in later?
2011-06-07T13:34:38  <tunabum> not sure exactly what you're doing... but that's how you can read what the browser's cookies are set as. You can do whatever you want with them afterwards :)
2011-06-07T13:36:25  <L4nce0> tunabum, the issue is this website is a coprate license. They enforce it by making me send a code to my email ( same code) which then presents a window to enter and link it to my browser. Then I can access the site. So if I have to go through that every time, I have a recovery eemail sent to my box every time I run the program.
2011-06-07T13:37:10  <L4nce0> I'm just trying to make these cookies stay between sessions
2011-06-07T13:39:17  <tunabum> ahhh, i see. Since you're using the old api, I don't know the best way to approach that. Probably just store the cookie value in a file and then set the cookie after you hit the page (you can do that with javascript)
2011-06-07T13:39:33  <L4nce0> I'm using old api? =)

2011-06-07T13:42:09  <tunabum> cool ;)
2011-06-07T13:42:46  <tunabum> you'll still need to do some trickery to get the cookie to persist between sessions
2011-06-07T13:44:03  <L4nce0> awesome. I think I'll just use the code I was using when I tried to do this in HTMLunit
2011-06-07T13:44:14  <L4nce0> just write the driver and read it

2011-06-07T14:42:05  <L4nce0> oh yeah? that make life easier, as I'd just enter this data, then done..
2011-06-07T14:42:58  <barancev> if you want pre-installed cookies, you have to prepare a new profile with cookies, addons, certificates and other stuff you need and init a new browser with this profile

2011-06-07T14:44:28  <barancev> or implement login :)
2011-06-07T14:44:40  <tunabum> there's nothing like that for the other drivers though, right?

2011-06-07T15:36:20  <Shesek> I'm also, but I'm obssesing about having selenium pass the tests. It seems to work for everyone but me ~
2011-06-07T15:37:00  <L4nce0> hmmm any other ideas on how to make selenium keep my session or cookies?
2011-06-07T15:38:06  <jarib> Shesek: your tests or selenium's own tests?
2011-06-07T15:38:55  <Shesek> Selenium's
2011-06-07T15:38:56  <tunabum> L4nce0: since it seems like you are trying to persist a session cookie (one that the browser deletes after it is closed), you might want to try making a property file that contains the value of your session cookie, have selenium open up a page then set the cookie value with javascript
2011-06-07T15:39:30  <L4nce0> hah if only I knew javascript ;)

2011-06-07T22:49:58  * Binken is no longer away : Gone for 59 minutes 19 seconds
2011-06-07T22:50:03  <Binken> Freynaud Morning?
2011-06-07T22:50:18  <freynaud> Binken: indeed :)
2011-06-07T22:52:00  <Binken> Freynaud, I have met a problem in my testcase about hoveron
2011-06-07T22:52:22  <Binken> I need hoveron a link fisrt, then wait for the div popup
2011-06-07T22:52:29  <freynaud> Binken: i'm probably not the best person for that
2011-06-07T22:52:57  <Binken> Click one of the elment contained in the popup
2011-06-07T22:52:58  <freynaud> is there a wait mechanism in the Action ?
2011-06-07T22:53:08  <Binken> YES I Do
2011-06-07T22:53:31  <Binken> But after the actions performs, the popup disappears
2011-06-07T22:53:43  *** cn has joined #selenium
2011-06-07T22:53:47  <Binken> I use 'actions.MoveToElement(element).Build().Perform();'
2011-06-07T22:53:55  <Binken> to do the hover work
2011-06-07T22:55:35  <Binken> So I am wondering is there any method can maintain the hoveron, and I still can do some actions
2011-06-07T22:57:25  *** celm has joined #selenium
2011-06-07T23:04:27  <freynaud> that's what i meant by wait in the action
2011-06-07T23:04:50  <freynaud> MoveTo().Wait().Click.perfom
2011-06-07T23:05:26  <freynaud> does't move to keep the cursor where it ends at after the action is done
2011-06-07T23:06:18  <Binken> Maybe I should write this wait class
2011-06-07T23:07:18  <freynaud> i'm not sure why is doesn't work actually
2011-06-07T23:07:31  <freynaud> after th click, your div should remain visible
