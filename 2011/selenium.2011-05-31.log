2011-05-31T02:17:50  <AutomatedTester> kondal: you either need to do it via get_eval or you need to move to selenium 2 and use send_keys
2011-05-31T02:18:21  <AutomatedTester> in Se1 the type command sets the value=
2011-05-31T02:18:35  <AutomatedTester> and since it doesnt have a value attribute it fails

2011-05-31T02:51:29  <kondal> barancev: Thanks, it is working fine with FF, I am trying with Chromedriver , can you please check from your side and let me know what is going wrong with me
2011-05-31T02:53:32  <kondal> AutomatedTester:  it is working fine with FF but it is not working with Chrome driver

2011-05-31T02:55:25  <simonstewart> That's the problem
2011-05-31T02:55:39  <AutomatedTester> i *think* we override it but not sure what we are getting back :(
2011-05-31T02:55:56  <AutomatedTester> if we are getting a XPCNativeWRapper thats empty then easy to solve
2011-05-31T02:56:00  <simonstewart> I think we're running into the problem with the inner/outer window problem
2011-05-31T02:56:11  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: I think so too
2011-05-31T02:56:33  <simonstewart> That should really be a problem that mozilla start to solve

2011-05-31T02:57:17  <kondal> barancev- I am using google chorme ver 11.0.696.71 , may be it is the issue ?
2011-05-31T02:57:31  <simonstewart> We should also start the conversation about how Mozilla can start owning the firefox driver a little more
2011-05-31T02:57:39  <AutomatedTester> kondal: you need Chrome 12+ for the new ChromeDriver
2011-05-31T02:57:54  <freynaud> simonstewart: hello :p
2011-05-31T02:58:00  <simonstewart> freynaud: hi
2011-05-31T02:58:09  <simonstewart> 'sup?
2011-05-31T02:58:39  <freynaud> i did some junit conversion
2011-05-31T02:58:43  <freynaud> can yo check http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12279
2011-05-31T02:59:06  <freynaud> especially GridInternalTestSuite.java
2011-05-31T02:59:25  <simonstewart> You want a code review? Or just pointing out that you're awesome? :)
2011-05-31T02:59:26  <freynaud> how can you specify 'run everything with a @Test annotation
2011-05-31T02:59:45  <freynaud> unfortunatly, the awesomeness is a bit premature
2011-05-31T02:59:52  <simonstewart> The "java_test" rule picks that up automatically
2011-05-31T02:59:56  <simonstewart> (or it should do)
2011-05-31T03:00:13  <freynaud> testNG was handling all the thread for me. Junit doesn't, or i don't use it right
2011-05-31T03:00:30  <freynaud> I have to spawn thread everywhere, the timeout aren't handle nicely etc
2011-05-31T03:00:44  <simonstewart> k
2011-05-31T03:00:53  <freynaud> java_test with source = the package didn't run any test for me
2011-05-31T03:01:02  <simonstewart> If I get some time, I'll have a hunt around
2011-05-31T03:01:06  <freynaud> I had to list the class 1 by one in a suite
2011-05-31T03:01:08  <simonstewart> freynaud: OK
2011-05-31T03:01:13  <freynaud> and that suite gets picked up automatically
2011-05-31T03:01:14  <simonstewart> I'll look into that
2011-05-31T03:01:28  <simonstewart> cos it should work with pure JUnit 4
2011-05-31T03:01:46  <simonstewart> We do use suites to pick out the important tests
2011-05-31T03:02:07  <freynaud> for grid internal, it's less of a problem. The end to end test use even more threads, so i'd like some review from someone knowing junit better before i mess up everything
2011-05-31T03:02:19  <simonstewart> :)
2011-05-31T03:02:40  <simonstewart> My plan today is mostly to do with getting an update of selenium landed here at work and helping Eran
2011-05-31T03:02:56  <simonstewart> If I have some spare cycles, I'll look into build suites dynamically using junit4

2011-05-31T03:28:13  <simonstewart> yeah
2011-05-31T03:29:01  <simonstewart> Though you also need to look at the java code too
2011-05-31T03:29:42  <eranm> So that's where proxy support is hiding
2011-05-31T03:29:59  <AutomatedTester> there is something satisfying about seeing tests pass in TDD

2011-05-31T03:31:51  <freynaud> is there already support for multi IE using RemoteWebDriver ?
2011-05-31T03:32:02  <freynaud> on the same windows
2011-05-31T03:33:08  <simonstewart> There is in Ruby and C#
2011-05-31T03:33:21  <simonstewart> Lemme read the code
2011-05-31T03:33:51  <simonstewart> I can't see the bit in the java code where we kill existing IE instances
2011-05-31T03:33:55  <simonstewart> You should be good to go
2011-05-31T03:34:27  <pngl> Is there a specific way of triggering keypress in IE? With a given input field, keyPress("input_id","13") works in FF but not in IE8.
2011-05-31T03:34:50  <simonstewart> You're triggering the keypress, it's just not updating the contents of the text input
2011-05-31T03:35:13  <simonstewart> keyPress and type are very different
2011-05-31T03:35:22  <simonstewart> keyPress = "fire a specific JS event"
2011-05-31T03:35:31  <simonstewart> type = "set the value of an input element"
2011-05-31T03:35:51  <pngl> simonstewart: I want it to submit the form.
2011-05-31T03:36:04  <simonstewart> Why not 'click' the submit button?
2011-05-31T03:36:12  <simonstewart> (I'm missing something obvious here ;)
2011-05-31T03:36:12  <pngl> simonstewart: because there isn't :)
2011-05-31T03:36:26  <simonstewart> That'll be the obvious thing
2011-05-31T03:36:41  <simonstewart> Using the webdriver api, you'd do a "element.submit()"
2011-05-31T03:36:51  <pngl> simonstewart: using selenium 1 :p
2011-05-31T03:37:02  *** kondal has quit IRC
2011-05-31T03:37:07  <simonstewart> Then you want to use "selenium.submit"

2011-05-31T03:37:56  <pngl> simonstewart: is it a known problem that enter keypresses can't be automated in IE?
2011-05-31T03:37:58  <freynaud> I have the VERSION.txt overwritten by aother one from JS
2011-05-31T03:38:26  <simonstewart> pngl: the keypress is being automated (in that the JS event _should_ be firing)
2011-05-31T03:38:41  <simonstewart> It's just not doing what you expect
2011-05-31T03:38:57  <pngl> simonstewart: so it is normal that I get a different behaviour on IE and FF ?
2011-05-31T03:39:03  <simonstewart> :( yes
2011-05-31T03:39:16  <simonstewart> Which is why selenium has so many commands

2011-05-31T03:41:00  <simonstewart> On the plus side, the webdriver APIs make an effort to mask the differences between browsers

2011-05-31T03:41:09  <simonstewart> I'm not sure
2011-05-31T03:41:22  <simonstewart> I have a fix that radically changes the way that "typeKeys" works
2011-05-31T03:41:28  <simonstewart> so that it actually updates fields
2011-05-31T03:41:40  <simonstewart> But since that changes the behaviour of selenium, it's not going to be landed
2011-05-31T03:41:54  <pngl> I wanted to use the webdriver API, but the ruby bindings don't have wait_* functions, which are indispensable.
2011-05-31T03:42:08  <simonstewart> Which functions do you need?
2011-05-31T03:42:20  <pngl> wait for element, wait for ajax...
2011-05-31T03:42:30  <simonstewart> Have you looked at using implicit waits?
2011-05-31T03:42:33  <pngl> And the ruby bindings can't fallback to the Selenium 1 api as the java does.
2011-05-31T03:43:15  <simonstewart> There's a "wait" class in selenium.webdriver.common
2011-05-31T03:43:50  <simonstewart> http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Wait.html
2011-05-31T03:44:27  <pngl> oh ok si I could wait on arbitrary conditions

2011-05-31T04:31:16  <simonstewart> yes
2011-05-31T04:31:23  <simonstewart> 2.0b3 is the one to go for right now
2011-05-31T04:31:31  <mydog2> and will i need to change anything in my test app?
2011-05-31T04:31:39  <mydog2> i can quickly paste it
2011-05-31T04:31:40  *** a7p has quit IRC
2011-05-31T04:32:02  <simonstewart> You should create your selenium instance like so:
2011-05-31T04:32:24  <simonstewart> Selenium se = new DefaultSelenium("localhost", 4444, "*firefox", "http://yoursite.com/");
2011-05-31T04:32:42  <simonstewart> By default the selenium server runs on port 4444
2011-05-31T04:32:50  <mydog2> http://fpaste.org/Odri/  <<<
2011-05-31T04:32:56  <mydog2> my test app...
2011-05-31T04:33:22  <mydog2> ok.. so in the test.. i'm going to have to add some things..
2011-05-31T04:33:27  <simonstewart> Ahhh... you're using the webdriver apis
2011-05-31T04:33:35  <simonstewart> Feel free to ignore everything I just said :)
2011-05-31T04:33:47  <simonstewart> You don't need the selenium-server running for the firefox driver
2011-05-31T04:34:10  <simonstewart> So where is that test failing?
2011-05-31T04:34:27  <mydog2> the test runs.. but i want to look at using a proxy server
2011-05-31T04:34:35  <simonstewart> Ahhh
2011-05-31T04:34:38  <simonstewart> That's easy :)
2011-05-31T04:34:46  <mydog2> i'm listening!!
2011-05-31T04:34:47  <simonstewart> FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile();
2011-05-31T04:35:14  <mydog2> and that's within the test harness i have..
2011-05-31T04:35:21  <simonstewart> Proxy proxy = new Proxy();
2011-05-31T04:35:26  <mydog2> ok..
2011-05-31T04:35:35  <simonstewart> proxy.setHttpProxy("http://www.youproxy:8080");
2011-05-31T04:35:41  <simonstewart> profile.setProxy(proxy);
2011-05-31T04:35:41  <mydog2> right...
2011-05-31T04:35:48  <simonstewart> new FirefoxDriver(profile);
2011-05-31T04:35:55  <simonstewart> Voila
2011-05-31T04:36:14  <mydog2> and all of that's within the test harness/app i created..
2011-05-31T04:36:19  <mydog2> i'll check it out..
2011-05-31T04:36:25  <simonstewart> k
2011-05-31T04:37:21  <mydog2> the target site appears to be imposing ip constraints/throttling.. so i'm cureious to see if using something like TOR/Privoxy would make a change
2011-05-31T04:38:11  <mydog2> the project is to extract textbook data
2011-05-31T04:38:33  <simonstewart> Well, that's how you set the proxy
2011-05-31T04:38:37  <simonstewart> Good luck!
2011-05-31T04:38:46  <mydog2> thanks.. 'ppreciate it..

2011-05-31T04:52:50  <pngl> simonstewart: so solutions to upload issues that use AutoIt aren't compatible with using Selenium RC unless client and server run on the same machine?
2011-05-31T04:53:07  <simonstewart> That's right
2011-05-31T04:53:12  <simonstewart> Question: autoit?
2011-05-31T04:53:15  <simonstewart> With the webdriver APIs?
2011-05-31T04:53:17  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: i didnt want to touch it since I can't reproduce it once...
2011-05-31T04:53:29  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: np
2011-05-31T04:53:53  <simonstewart> I can reliably recreate it by running the firefox-rc-tests on an actual Win7 machine
2011-05-31T04:53:58  <pngl> simonstewart: still selenium 1. But I don't think webdriver would help, I'm uploading using Flash (swfupload).
2011-05-31T04:54:15  <simonstewart> Then you need to be on localhost
2011-05-31T04:54:29  <simonstewart> Question: why are we rebuilding everything though nothing has changed?
2011-05-31T04:54:41  <simonstewart> Looks like the c++ compilation is over-enthusiastic about replacing "stuff"
2011-05-31T04:54:41  <pngl> simonstewart: autoit is a windows automation tool. I wanted to delegate clicking on the upload button to AutoIt, then give control back to selenium.

2011-05-31T04:58:29  <pngl> simonstewart: so it will allow direct control of the Windows OS?

2011-05-31T05:02:21  <pngl> simonstewart: sorry, I have an additional question. Off the top of your head, can you think of a simpler solution (apart from using grid 2) than the one I'm about to do to the problem of testing flash upload on a remote machine?
2011-05-31T05:03:01  <simonstewart> Flash uploads are a bugger to automate

2011-05-31T05:15:48  <simonstewart> a little more context might be useful :)
2011-05-31T05:19:49  <eranm> sbarcteam, the only user-tweakable setting that can affect accepting untrusted SSL certificates is FirefoxProfile.setAssumeUntrustedCertificateIssuer.

2011-05-31T05:59:31  <amitev> i solved it using findElement(By.id("modal panel id")).findElement(By.id("the element i'm looking for"))
2011-05-31T06:00:14  <amitev> the key was to find the element from other element that is currently on the foreground
2011-05-31T06:00:22  <simonstewart> And when you located the element that way "isDisplayed" returned "true"?

2011-05-31T06:27:34  <jimevans> what's the convention for driver-specific custom capability names? camelCase? snake_case?
2011-05-31T06:28:03  <simonstewart> camel
2011-05-31T06:28:57  <jimevans> thanks. not to be contrary, but the custom firefox profile capability is "firefox_profile", so I wasn't sure.
2011-05-31T06:29:22  <simonstewart> Once the next release is out, we're going to have a whale of a time sorting out the inconsistencies
2011-05-31T06:29:26  <simonstewart> and docs
2011-05-31T06:29:28  <simonstewart> and examples
2011-05-31T06:29:32  <jimevans> indeed.
2011-05-31T06:30:02  <jimevans> i'm adding an "ignoreProtectedModeSettings" custom capability for IE and I wanted to be consistent.

2011-05-31T06:43:02  <rpk> Do you guys know if theres an open bug for incorrectly detecting the OS for element not found?  Its reporting OS as VISTA, but the OS.name string correctly reports Win 7
2011-05-31T06:43:29  <simonstewart> Hmmm...
2011-05-31T06:43:37  <simonstewart> we should fix that

2011-05-31T06:45:26  <simonstewart> How come so many?
2011-05-31T06:45:31  <AutomatedTester> its old IE bugs that I asked people to retest
2011-05-31T06:46:11  <simonstewart> Nice
2011-05-31T06:46:23  <AutomatedTester> i thought 3 releases is enough for them to "use it or lose it"

2011-05-31T06:51:25  <rpk> I still have the code snippet for it in my workspace at home.
2011-05-31T06:55:19  <jimevans> time to reboot. stupid shell extension install. back in a second.

2011-05-31T07:11:00  <jimevans> so mongoose just implemented a fix to enable keep-alive...
2011-05-31T07:12:37  <simonstewart> Ooooohhhhhh,,,,
2011-05-31T07:12:42  <simonstewart> Nice
2011-05-31T07:13:16  <jimevans> i'm sorely tempted to pick up the latest and greatest (3.1).
2011-05-31T07:14:40  <simonstewart> Other than the difference with keep alive, what are the advantages?
2011-05-31T07:14:44  <simonstewart> (am curious)
2011-05-31T07:15:09  <jimevans> i didn't really see any. there are some bug fixes, including one that we had already implemented in our version.
2011-05-31T07:15:44  <jimevans> most of the fixes are in things like editing the password file and so on (features we really don't use).
2011-05-31T07:15:52  <simonstewart> Well, being on trunk with keep-alive fixed is a big plus
2011-05-31T07:16:45  <jimevans> agreed. i synced and updated in one of my enlistments, and didn't see any issues.
2011-05-31T07:17:13  <jimevans> That said, mongoose is one of those components where the potential problem probably won't show up until further on down the line...
2011-05-31T07:18:02  <simonstewart> Why don't we wait until after the release?
2011-05-31T07:18:10  <jimevans> my thoughts exactly.
2011-05-31T07:18:17  <simonstewart> Great minds :)
2011-05-31T07:18:42  <ChrisCNexus> what are you using mongoose for?
2011-05-31T07:19:03  <jimevans> mongoose is the HTTP server that the IE driver native code uses.
2011-05-31T07:19:23  <jimevans> it allows the language bindings to consider the IE driver a subclass of RemoteWebDriver.
2011-05-31T07:19:24  <ChrisCNexus> the c++ code right?
2011-05-31T07:19:36  <simonstewart> aye
2011-05-31T07:19:40  <simonstewart> it's also used in the chrome driver

2011-05-31T07:20:47  <jimevans> indeed, except i believe they're using a rather old version of it in the ChromeDriver
2011-05-31T07:21:06  <jimevans> unless they've updated since i last looked at that code (which is entirely possible)
2011-05-31T07:23:31  <simonstewart> I don't think that they have
2011-05-31T07:24:32  <simonstewart> Who's got a few spare minutes?

2011-05-31T07:25:10  <eranm> AutomatedTester, there are two python tests failing on my machine, both of them in frame switching tests. Know about it?
2011-05-31T07:25:14  <simonstewart> I'd love to make sure that they're all categorized so that we can triage them

2011-05-31T07:28:15  <jimevans> (because it's likely a config issue on the user's part)
2011-05-31T07:29:18  <jimevans> i'll be very glad to get rc1 out, because we'll now throw an error for the protected mode settings mismatch, which may reduce spurious issue reports.

2011-05-31T07:30:11  <simonstewart> How are the C# tests?
2011-05-31T07:31:02  <jimevans> i've tested IE most often (6, 7, 8, and 9), and they run as clean as they ever do.
2011-05-31T07:31:17  <jimevans> i'll do a quick firefox check. give me 10 minutes.
2011-05-31T07:31:42  <jimevans> or maybe longer. i'm downloading teh internets. (gecko2)
2011-05-31T07:31:49  <simonstewart> #1724 looks interesting

2011-05-31T07:32:05  <jimevans> yes, i've got that one open in my browser right now.
2011-05-31T07:32:27  <jimevans> i'm not terribly surprised.
2011-05-31T07:33:32  <jimevans> knowing the native code, i can imagine having the frame we're focused on disappear out from under us is going to hurt.
2011-05-31T07:33:33  <simonstewart> I thought we had structured exception handling enabled?
2011-05-31T07:33:54  <simonstewart> And caught problems, only to return "we're all doomed" if an exception was caught
2011-05-31T07:33:59  <simonstewart> jimevans: agreed
2011-05-31T07:35:16  <jimevans> the VS C++ compiler uses the /EHa switch (which is "Enable C++ Exceptions = 'Yes With SEH Exceptions'"

2011-05-31T08:14:17  <eranm> Mayank, actually, the problem is not related to that. But go ahead and mention your case

2011-05-31T08:21:41  <AutomatedTester> ok, still trying to do an svn up on my linux VM
2011-05-31T08:22:31  <eranm> yes, this whole bloated SVN thing is not promising. jarib , you happen to be here? I'd like to pair and get this script to download Gecko SDK on Linux
2011-05-31T08:23:16  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart, eranm: next time we plan on doing a release can I come visit
2011-05-31T08:23:52  <eranm> But of course
2011-05-31T08:23:57  <eranm> would you like to come tomorrow?
2011-05-31T08:24:11  <AutomatedTester> cant tomorrow, cant this week :(

2011-05-31T08:27:06  <eranm> Mayank, sorry, but I'm not familiar enough with the table format to provide help. If you're comfortable with Python, consider trying the Selenium 2 API in Python
2011-05-31T08:29:14  <Mayank> eranm: I will have to stick to the table format, there are 4-5 of us working on different scenarios, thanks anyway!

2011-05-31T09:34:58  <cmcintosh> thanks
2011-05-31T09:35:49  <cmcintosh> anyone awake?
2011-05-31T09:39:28  <ChrisCNexus> cmintosh
2011-05-31T09:39:41  <cmcintosh> still around
2011-05-31T09:39:41  <ChrisCNexus> you using selenium rc?
2011-05-31T09:39:46  <cmcintosh> yes
2011-05-31T09:39:54  <ChrisCNexus> selenium 1 or 2?

2011-05-31T09:42:04  <ChrisCNexus> is how i did it in c# for selenium2 webdriver
2011-05-31T09:42:10  <ChrisCNexus> might give you some idea how to do it
2011-05-31T09:42:41  <ChrisCNexus> if you have any questions about it ask
2011-05-31T09:42:49  <cmcintosh> not really, i dont know c# or java very well but ill bump around i guess
2011-05-31T09:43:07  <cmcintosh> its surprising something simple like screenshots is not documented somewhere
2011-05-31T09:43:35  <ChrisCNexus> your using the firefox addon right?
2011-05-31T09:43:57  <cmcintosh> yea sort of
2011-05-31T09:43:59  <ChrisCNexus> selnium ide?
2011-05-31T09:44:06  <cmcintosh> i have the plugin installed
2011-05-31T09:44:11  <ChrisCNexus> if your using selnium RC your coding
2011-05-31T09:44:18  <cmcintosh> not figured it out, I have been running the java stuff
2011-05-31T09:44:31  <ChrisCNexus> ok
2011-05-31T09:44:32  <cmcintosh> i do have ide installed
2011-05-31T09:44:49  <ChrisCNexus> i dont think the screenshots is possible in the ide
2011-05-31T09:45:00  <cmcintosh> ok
2011-05-31T09:45:09  <cmcintosh> well i installed both rc and the ide, was not sure what to use
2011-05-31T09:45:16  <ChrisCNexus> ok
2011-05-31T09:45:22  <ChrisCNexus> the ide is for simple use
2011-05-31T09:45:27  <ChrisCNexus> and to help you get started
2011-05-31T09:45:37  <ChrisCNexus> as you can create the test in the ide then export it as code to java or such
2011-05-31T09:45:56  <ChrisCNexus> and add the screenshot into the exported code

2011-05-31T09:46:09  <ChrisCNexus> from what i've heard
2011-05-31T09:46:12  <ChrisCNexus> if you want to use java
2011-05-31T09:46:15  <ChrisCNexus> get Eclipse
2011-05-31T09:46:45  <cmcintosh> i got eclipse

2011-05-31T09:53:12  <freynaud> cmcintosh: try to avoid your screenshot link. It takes a screenshot of the desktop. If your browser doesn't have the focus, is not maximize etc, it won't work
2011-05-31T09:53:26  *** andytinkham has quit IRC
2011-05-31T09:53:38  <freynaud> selenium already provides easy way to take full page screenshot for firefox and IE. Try to use that if you can
2011-05-31T09:53:42  <jimevans> eranm: Visual Studio 2008 SP1 with security updates applied?
2011-05-31T09:53:47  <cmcintosh> k
2011-05-31T09:53:54  <cmcintosh> i tried what was linked and get errors
2011-05-31T09:54:17  <cmcintosh> im running the rc on the same machine as the test, if that makes a difference
2011-05-31T09:55:08  <jimevans> eranm: in particular, you need KB973675 applied post-SP1.
2011-05-31T09:55:38  <cmcintosh> what i get is that Augmenter cannot be resolved to a type
2011-05-31T09:56:02  <eranm> jimevans, you're right - I don't have this applied
2011-05-31T09:57:51  <cmcintosh> am i missing libs or something? i am just referencing the selenium-java-2.0b3.jar file in eclipse
2011-05-31T10:00:22  <jarib> eranm: i'm about to head out, we could look at the gecko download tomorrow maybe? i'll be around tomorrow

2011-05-31T10:01:59  <cmcintosh> ok
2011-05-31T10:02:06  <cmcintosh> so if i remove the Augmenter line it works
2011-05-31T10:03:02  <ChrisCNexus> cmcintosh: is the file there?
2011-05-31T10:03:10  <cmcintosh> freynuad: was able to get it to work without the use of the Augmenter line
2011-05-31T10:03:15  <cmcintosh> ChrisCNexus: yes

2011-05-31T10:03:48  <jimevans> i'm looking for a good (well-written) anti-record-playback screed. any suggestions?
2011-05-31T10:04:44  <jimevans> (i'm sure there's somebody out there on the web that's done a more thoughtful job than me at articulating that particular best-practice)
2011-05-31T10:06:18  <eranm> jimevans, it's so well-known that this approach is problematic that I find it hard pointing to a specific resource about it
2011-05-31T10:07:04  <jimevans> yeah, that's exactly the problem i'm running into.
2011-05-31T10:07:25  <jimevans> i need to resort to a dirty debate trick ("appeal to authority") to get my point across.
2011-05-31T10:12:04  <simonstewart> Why not Brett's talk from SeConf?
2011-05-31T10:12:25  <simonstewart> I thought that was actually a pretty good screed
2011-05-31T10:13:19  <jimevans> i thought so too. he's pretty good at getting worked up against record-playback for all the right reasons. :)
2011-05-31T10:15:14  <simonstewart> Indeed

2011-05-31T10:20:35  <jimevans> i'm looking for a good (well-written) anti-record-playback screed.
2011-05-31T10:21:06  <freynaud> maintenance will kill you !
2011-05-31T10:21:11  <freynaud> good enough ? :)
2011-05-31T10:21:20  <jimevans> i mean, *I* know it's a bad practice, and I can articulate why, but i'm not sure I can say "I'm the expert, trust me."
2011-05-31T10:21:37  <jimevans> at least, not in this case.
2011-05-31T10:21:56  <simonstewart> Doesn't adamgroucher have something?
2011-05-31T10:22:53  <jimevans> probably. he's an opinionated sort.
2011-05-31T10:25:11  <jimevans> i've got an outsource contract organization that went off and did their own "tools analysis"
2011-05-31T10:26:38  <freynaud> is that the kind of analysis explaining this tool is great because you can have it used by people who have no clue about testing ? :)
2011-05-31T10:27:55  <jimevans> not exactly, but they have placed an emphasis on the "r-p" features of the tools they evaluated.
2011-05-31T10:28:10  <jimevans> mind, i didn't *ask* for this analysis.
2011-05-31T10:29:00  <jimevans> and they, after all, work for me. :)
2011-05-31T10:29:57  <jimevans> but i'd rather take the time to educate, rather than just decree it so by executive fiat.
2011-05-31T10:30:33  <ChrisCNexus> anybody have a link to bretts talk at seconf?

2011-05-31T10:37:47  <jerryb_> Hi -- what special things do I need to do to test AJAX applications with selenium?
2011-05-31T10:38:44  <ChrisCNexus> jerryb_: its the same as regular web page testing
2011-05-31T10:38:47  <ChrisCNexus> but for one difference
2011-05-31T10:39:09  <ChrisCNexus> you need to wait for the ajax to finish and detect it
2011-05-31T10:39:21  <ChrisCNexus> best way is an implicit wait
2011-05-31T10:39:38  <ChrisCNexus> the .wait() in selenium works
2011-05-31T10:39:49  <ChrisCNexus> basically keeps looking for an element to appear

2011-05-31T11:18:49  <autojack> so, at a previous job I used to use Selenium RC with Perl for testing. at my new gig we use Ruby and rspec a lot, so I was looking for a way to write rspec tests that use Selenium.
2011-05-31T11:19:30  <autojack> I thought Capybara looked like a good approach, but now I see that there might be a more direct way to just write rspec tests that use Selenium directly.
2011-05-31T11:19:34  <autojack> with the Selenium gem.
2011-05-31T11:19:37  <autojack> anyone have any thoughts on this?
2011-05-31T11:19:45  <RossPatterson> There are a bunch of folks using Ruby to write Selenium RC tests.  I don't know if they're doing it with RSpec, though.  Yo no hablo "Ruby" :-)

2011-05-31T11:36:48  <autojack> well, it looks like Capybara is really just a DSL for UI testing. both Selenium and rspec are just optional ways to use it.
2011-05-31T11:36:55  <autojack> I don't really need that, I'd rather just use raw Selenium.
2011-05-31T11:42:59  <gp5st> I'm not even sure why this would be happening? are there restrictions placed on windows opened by js or the command line?

2011-05-31T11:50:59  <RossPatterson> Archdude: You can't do it without a loop or JavaScript.
2011-05-31T11:51:14  <autojack> gp5st: ohh, you mean you're trying to test a page on http://localhost which refers to .js resources that are on another URL?
2011-05-31T11:51:16  <gp5st> autojack: It's not really an error.  Any resource (script, image, &c) not on localhost doesn't load.  Hence jquery isn't loading causing some js errors and such. In the network pane of chromum dev tools all external requests are listed as pending
2011-05-31T11:51:29  <RossPatterson> Mayank: That's a known bug.  Getting it working is the one problem preventing the release of 2.0RC1.
2011-05-31T11:51:57  <autojack> gp5st: yeah I think that's your browser trying to prevent XSS.
2011-05-31T11:52:08  <gp5st> autojack: for a script and img tag?
2011-05-31T11:52:11  <Mayank> RossPatterson: No "workaround" for this? If I could change something?
2011-05-31T11:52:19  <autojack> img tag does seem surprising.
2011-05-31T11:52:24  <autojack> script, not surprising.
2011-05-31T11:52:25  <gp5st> in the source, these aren't generated by js, autojack
2011-05-31T11:52:38  <autojack> hm, OK
2011-05-31T11:52:41  <gp5st> autojack: this all works as expected when not using selenium
2011-05-31T11:52:50  <autojack> yeah
2011-05-31T11:52:52  <RossPatterson> Mayank: Nope, it's a problem in the drivers.
2011-05-31T11:53:07  <autojack> I remember having a similar problem though, and it did work fine when not using Selenium.
2011-05-31T11:53:17  <gp5st> i first thought about same origin, but that shouldn't apply to tags :-\ I thought anyway
2011-05-31T11:53:29  <autojack> it was something to do with Selenium itself making the browser run in higher security mode or whatever.
2011-05-31T11:53:36  <autojack> because Selenium was hooking in at the js level.
2011-05-31T11:53:44  <autojack> but this was when I was using Selenium 1.x/RC
2011-05-31T11:53:48  *** dlam has joined #selenium

2011-05-31T11:54:05  <autojack> well, someone else in here probably knows more than me.
2011-05-31T11:54:18  <gp5st> well, thanks for at least letting me know i'm not crazy:)
2011-05-31T11:54:23  <autojack> hehe
2011-05-31T11:54:30  <Mayank> RossPatterson: aah! any time frame for the release of 2.0RC1?
2011-05-31T11:54:32  <autojack> it does sound like the problems I used to have, but it's been a year.
2011-05-31T11:54:53  <Archdude> RossPatterson: well my main problem is the get_attribute command always gets the first of whatever matches the criteria like this > page = sel.get_attribute("//a[contains(@title, 'indexed')]@href")
2011-05-31T11:55:10  <Archdude> so even though there are 10 of them on the page it just stores the first
2011-05-31T11:55:29  <Archdude> but they all are identical except for the values i'm trying to grab
2011-05-31T11:55:41  <RossPatterson> Mayank: As soon as that bug gets fixed.  It's literally the only hold-up.

2011-05-31T11:56:42  <Archdude> theres say 10 on a page that match up except for the value href (which is what i'm trying to store)
2011-05-31T11:56:57  <Mayank> RossPatterson: do you have the tracker issue number handy? I dont mind searching for it.
2011-05-31T11:57:16  <RossPatterson> Archdude: Seriously - you have <tag href="val1" href="val2" ... href="val10">???

2011-05-31T11:58:00  <Mayank> autojack: the problem you were mentioning earlier was for gp5st or for me? <the one that got resolved by not using selenium?>
2011-05-31T11:58:01  <Archdude> yup - and all 10 have the same title
2011-05-31T11:58:06  <RossPatterson> Mayank: The tracker is at http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list.  I don't know the issue number.
2011-05-31T11:58:14  <Archdude> which is why im not able to uniquely identify any of them
2011-05-31T11:58:58  <Mayank> RossPatterson: thanks for the link. Any reasons for asking me the version number? Can i switch back to some old version and have that functionalty?
2011-05-31T11:59:16  <Archdude> first time ive run into this kind of thing
2011-05-31T11:59:17  <RossPatterson> Archdude: Quoting Ralph Wiggum, "Me fail [HTML coding]?  That un-possible!".  Wow.  I'm surprised you can even load that page into a browser.
2011-05-31T11:59:57  <Archdude> it's just a freelance gig i have going here
2011-05-31T12:00:02  <Archdude> and believe it or not it's a pretty well-known site
2011-05-31T12:00:06  <Archdude> relatively speaking
2011-05-31T12:00:17  <Archdude> go figure lol
2011-05-31T12:00:36  <RossPatterson> Mayank: Yes and maybe.  The problem has been mentioned repeatedly in the 2.0b3  context.  It may not exist in earlier 2.0 versions, but that's not clear.
2011-05-31T12:01:28  <Mayank> RossPatterson: Ill test and see! thanks.

2011-05-31T12:02:34  <RossPatterson> Archdude: I can't even imagine how that would be represented in the DOM.  I *think* a compliant browser would discard all but one of the attributes, but I couldn't predict which one would survive.  You might want to inspect the page with Firebug and see what Firefox does with that tag.

2011-05-31T12:08:00  <ChrisCNexus> good stuff
2011-05-31T12:08:29  <ChrisCNexus> are all the seconf videos uploaded by saucelabs?
2011-05-31T12:09:19  <Archdude> RossPatterson: each time the page loads, there's a list of 10 users - title = user's profile and href = (link to their page) - all other identifiers are the same
2011-05-31T12:09:41  <Archdude> on this other script i tried storing using contains like this - page = sel.get_attribute("//a[contains(@title, 'indexed')]@href")
2011-05-31T12:09:44  <Archdude> er
2011-05-31T12:10:01  <ChrisCNexus> i'm intrigued to see this html, can you link it?
2011-05-31T12:10:02  <Archdude> page = sel.get_attribute("//a[contains(@title, 's profile')]@href")
2011-05-31T12:11:29  <phdaemon> for the selenium php driver, should i ask here or in the phpunit channel?
2011-05-31T12:11:43  <phdaemon> clear
2011-05-31T12:12:35  <autojack> I'm always amazed when I google for something and get no results.
2011-05-31T12:12:43  <autojack> "undefined local variable or method `selenium_driver'"
2011-05-31T12:12:44  <autojack> ^^^
2011-05-31T12:13:03  <phdaemon> lol?
2011-05-31T12:13:05  <phdaemon> nah
2011-05-31T12:13:10  <phdaemon> the phpunit selenium driver
2011-05-31T12:13:19  <phdaemon> is just Driver or SeleniumTestCase.php
2011-05-31T12:13:28  <phdaemon> driver is in namespace SeleniumTestCase
2011-05-31T12:13:58  <phdaemon> either way it seems the error im getting is more related to RC than here from me googling around so
2011-05-31T12:14:03  <RossPatterson> Ah ... so it's not all one element, it's 10 elements.  THAT we can handle!
2011-05-31T12:14:09  <phdaemon> i'll throw it out here and hope to get a response
2011-05-31T12:14:17  <Archdude> yeah, sorry if I didn't make it too clear
2011-05-31T12:15:05  <phdaemon> I'm doing this: $this->captureEntirePageScreenshot($dir . $screen); ||| and im getting this error ||| The error message is: Component returned failure code: 0x80520001 (NS_ERROR_FILE_UNRECOGNIZED_PATH) [nsILocalFile.initWithPath]. |||

2011-05-31T12:15:24  <phdaemon> oh :) lol
2011-05-31T12:15:34  <Archdude> basically the command I'm trying to use (get_attribute) is only grabbing the first of a set of 10 that would match that xpath
2011-05-31T12:15:51  <autojack> I'm getting the "undefined local variable or method `selenium_driver'" and Google has 0 info on it.
2011-05-31T12:15:55  <RossPatterson> Try using get_xpath_count("//a[contains(@title, 'indexed')]"), then iterating over get_attribute("xpath=(//a[contains(@title, 'indexed')])[" + i + "]@href")
2011-05-31T12:15:55  <jarib> autojack: that's a very basic ruby error.
2011-05-31T12:16:04  <autojack> I realize that :)
2011-05-31T12:16:09  <jarib> it's not a problem with selenium, it's your code
2011-05-31T12:16:19  <jarib> (very likely)
2011-05-31T12:16:31  <jarib> it should point you to the file/line where it happens
2011-05-31T12:16:34  <autojack> MY code doesn't reference selenium_driver anywhere.
2011-05-31T12:16:40  <autojack> the Selenium ruby driver might.
2011-05-31T12:16:47  <jarib> what gem are you using?
2011-05-31T12:16:59  <RossPatterson> Note the use of "xpath=(...original xpath...)[index]@href" - the parens and the xpath= are critical
2011-05-31T12:17:12  <autojack> and no it doesn't give me a line number
2011-05-31T12:17:28  <jarib> what gem are you using?
2011-05-31T12:17:31  <autojack> the entirety of the error is: Problem while setting context on example startundefined local variable or method `selenium_driver' for #<Spec::Example::ExampleGroup::Subclass_1:0x1018eb988>
2011-05-31T12:17:42  <autojack> jarib: Selenium and selenium-client
2011-05-31T12:17:46  <autojack> (are the gems)
2011-05-31T12:17:59  <jarib> selenium-client isn't maintained
2011-05-31T12:18:13  <autojack> I'm guessing selenium/rspec/spec_helper is the problem.
2011-05-31T12:18:14  <jarib> you should be using selenium-webdriver (which includes the old selenium-client code)
2011-05-31T12:18:25  <autojack> hmm, OK.
2011-05-31T12:18:39  <jarib> and all of the rspec helper stuff is removed
2011-05-31T12:18:52  <autojack> umm. hmm.
2011-05-31T12:19:03  <autojack> well I went down this path from reading http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/02/running-selenium-tests-for-rails/
2011-05-31T12:19:07  <autojack> I realize that's over a year old :)
2011-05-31T12:19:16  <autojack> but what I want is to write Selenium tests using rspec.
2011-05-31T12:19:27  <autojack> I keep hitting dead ends trying to figure out the best way to do that.
2011-05-31T12:19:33  <autojack> sounds like this is another one?
2011-05-31T12:19:37  <Archdude> RossPatterson: Thanks a lot! I'll give that a try
2011-05-31T12:20:20  <phdaemon> so... any ideas on my error message? :(
2011-05-31T12:20:28  <jarib> autojack: you definitely can, but the selenium-client authors made some bad choices when integrating that tightly with rspec (which is a moving target)
2011-05-31T12:21:02  <autojack> yeah, it seems that way - I had to downgrade to rspec 1.x to get this far.

2011-05-31T12:21:12  <jarib> right.
2011-05-31T12:21:21  <autojack> do you have any other suggestions for how I can do this? or should I just not bother?
2011-05-31T12:21:35  <autojack> I only wanted to use rspec because it's consistent with our other tests.
2011-05-31T12:21:57  <jarib> use selenium-webdriver
2011-05-31T12:22:08  <jarib> or capybara if you want nice rails integration
2011-05-31T12:22:19  *** rpk has joined #selenium
2011-05-31T12:22:22  <autojack> ugh, I tried Capybara, that was worse frankly.
2011-05-31T12:22:28  <jarib> in what sense?
2011-05-31T12:22:47  <autojack> it just seemed like Selenium and rspec were afterthoughts with Capybara.
2011-05-31T12:22:58  <autojack> I got all hung up with the classic SSL cert problems.
2011-05-31T12:23:33  <autojack> spent a day dicking around with that and then today switched to this the rspec-client approach and at least got past that.
2011-05-31T12:23:37  <autojack> shrug
2011-05-31T12:24:13  <jarib> capybara uses webdriver, which works very well when it comes to SSL stuff
2011-05-31T12:24:18  <autojack> I just want to get to a point of writing some basic tests that actually work. I spent a year using Selenium 1.x and Perl at an old job so I'm not a total newb with Selenium itself.
2011-05-31T12:24:35  <autojack> well, I was getting the certificate error dialog.
2011-05-31T12:24:40  <jarib> which one?
2011-05-31T12:24:53  <jarib> there's a specific edge case, which you can work around easily
2011-05-31T12:25:03  <autojack> hmm
2011-05-31T12:25:20  <jarib> if you're deploying valid certificates (e.g. from production) to your test environments
2011-05-31T12:25:23  <autojack> I'm not sure exactly, I was seeing the "this certificate is insecure" or whatever dialog.
2011-05-31T12:25:38  <jarib> then you need to tell webdriver that the issuer is trusted
2011-05-31T12:25:59  <jarib> "insecure" can mean various things
2011-05-31T12:26:02  <autojack> I created a FF profile with an exception for that cert. it worked fine manually. but when I told Capybara to use it, it still showed the error.
2011-05-31T12:26:15  <autojack> I know. OK, let me reset to Capybara and check the specific error.
2011-05-31T12:26:25  <autojack> I tried to get help in the #capybara channel and got silence.
2011-05-31T12:26:35  <autojack> thanks for trying to help :)
2011-05-31T12:26:57  <autojack> incidentally, I'm not sure if I need rails-specific integration, and I don't care that much about Capybara's specific DSL.
2011-05-31T12:27:16  <jarib> ok
2011-05-31T12:27:22  <jarib> so you should still be using the selenium-webdriver gem
2011-05-31T12:27:26  <jarib> since it's maintained
2011-05-31T12:27:29  <autojack> the selenium-client approach was more familiar to me where it has me set up a specific connection to my local Selenium server.
2011-05-31T12:27:47  <autojack> Capybara seems to... I dunno. bundle Selenium itself or something?
2011-05-31T12:27:54  <autojack> it didn't seem to be connecting to my running Selenium.
2011-05-31T12:27:56  <jarib> then, you have a choice of using the RC API or WebDriver API
2011-05-31T12:28:01  <autojack> OK.
2011-05-31T12:28:03  <jarib> WebDriver doesn't need a server.
2011-05-31T12:28:18  <jarib> (and caypbara uses webdriver)
2011-05-31T12:28:39  <jarib> you can still use webdriver directly without any of the capybara stuff
2011-05-31T12:28:39  <autojack> ohhhh
2011-05-31T12:28:43  <autojack> whacky. OK.
2011-05-31T12:28:50  <jarib> or use the API you already know
2011-05-31T12:28:56  <autojack> hmm
2011-05-31T12:28:59  <autojack> too many choices :)
2011-05-31T12:28:59  <jarib> (with the server)
2011-05-31T12:29:21  <autojack> umm.
2011-05-31T12:30:03  <autojack> what I really want is a guide to getting started that Just Works for me :)
2011-05-31T12:30:09  <autojack> that's been one of my problems.
2011-05-31T12:30:22  <autojack> can I use webdriver with rspec alone?
2011-05-31T12:30:26  <jarib> yep
2011-05-31T12:30:32  <autojack> maybe that would be simplest.
2011-05-31T12:30:36  <ChrisCNexus> webdriver is great
2011-05-31T12:30:47  <jarib> autojack: absolutely
2011-05-31T12:31:31  <autojack> so where should I start? is there a doc I can read somewhere?

2011-05-31T12:32:56  <ChrisCNexus> exactly what it is

2011-05-31T12:34:13  <jarib> rspec + webdriver sounds like a good choice then.

2011-05-31T12:34:36  <autojack> so maybe I should set up some of this stuff in my spec_helper.rb?
2011-05-31T12:34:52  <autojack> and then I can just access the webdriver methods and so on from my specs?

2011-05-31T12:37:08  <ChrisCNexus> jarib: on that note, how hard is it to push webdriver tests through rc or is that what grid2 is for?
2011-05-31T12:37:32  <autojack> I think I thought I needed some specific rspec support somewhere.
2011-05-31T12:38:33  <jarib> ChrisCNexus: through RC? RC usually means the Se 1 technology
2011-05-31T12:38:36  <rpk> Is there an easy way to limit the number of concurrent executions on a grid agent machine to 1?
2011-05-31T12:38:55  <jarib> webdriver also has a remote server implementation though, which is part of the same server
2011-05-31T12:39:31  <ChrisCNexus> thats what i was wondering
2011-05-31T12:39:33  <rpk> (for test isolation)
2011-05-31T12:39:42  <ChrisCNexus> I thought grid2 was expanding that
2011-05-31T12:40:06  <freynaud> rpk: maxConcurrent 1 is what you want
2011-05-31T12:40:13  <rpk> thank you :)
2011-05-31T12:40:25  <jarib> ChrisCNexus: it does, yeah (supports both old RC and the new WebDriver protocol)
2011-05-31T12:40:33  <freynaud> i use that when I start a grid locally and want to debug, or on windows boxes with only 1 display
2011-05-31T12:41:19  <ChrisCNexus> jarib: ah thanks, currently i have a suite of tests in webdriver and they run on a test box through a hudson slave
2011-05-31T12:41:37  <ChrisCNexus> and to test multi browsers it just changes the ini and runs them all again for the next browser
2011-05-31T12:41:48  <ChrisCNexus> if i decide i want to run parallel i wanted to be able to just hook it up to grid
2011-05-31T12:43:15  <jarib> yeah, that should work
2011-05-31T12:43:19  <jarib> freynaud's your man :)
2011-05-31T12:43:48  <ChrisCNexus> nice a sauce guy?
2011-05-31T12:43:55  <ChrisCNexus> should be a , in there
2011-05-31T12:44:03  <freynaud> no
2011-05-31T12:44:27  <ChrisCNexus> ok
2011-05-31T12:45:36  <ChrisCNexus> freynaud: you working with grid2 at all?
2011-05-31T12:46:02  <freynaud> yes, but I'm working for eBay, not sauce

2011-05-31T12:58:38  <freynaud> are you using firefox ? if yes, have you tried with a clean one ? I think I had similar error when ff was running for a long time
2011-05-31T13:01:12  <phdaemon> firefox or chrome
2011-05-31T13:01:12  <autojack> jarib: FYI, these are the SSL errors I get: not from a trusted source; only valid for the following names (wildcard should be valid here...); expired
2011-05-31T13:01:13  <phdaemon> same thing
2011-05-31T13:01:19  <phdaemon> linux and windows, same thing also :(
2011-05-31T13:01:37  <phdaemon> autojack, get valid certs. I had errors like that because of wildcards too
2011-05-31T13:01:50  <phdaemon> like *.mysite.com
2011-05-31T13:01:53  <phdaemon> would cause an error
2011-05-31T13:02:16  <phdaemon> an alternate is to set up a profile in browsers that support it
2011-05-31T13:02:24  <jarib> phdaemon: you're not using webdriver though?
2011-05-31T13:02:35  <phdaemon> im using grid through Jenkins
2011-05-31T13:03:22  <autojack> I have a profile with an exception for this cert. I'm trying to use it, but I still get the same errors.
2011-05-31T13:03:24  <jarib> the clearspace link in your error indicates you're using Selenium 1/RC, not WebDriver
2011-05-31T13:03:34  <autojack> I'm doing: driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox, :profile => "selenium"
2011-05-31T13:03:37  <jarib> autojack is using WebDriver
2011-05-31T13:03:49  <jarib> autojack: did you post to the capybara list about this?
2011-05-31T13:03:50  <phdaemon> jarib, yes. Selenium grid is not webdriver, its RC
2011-05-31T13:04:01  <autojack> jarib: no. and now I'm not using Capybara :)
2011-05-31T13:04:05  <autojack> still having the problem.
2011-05-31T13:04:17  <jarib> ok, someone there recently asked a very similar question
2011-05-31T13:04:18  <jarib> so
2011-05-31T13:04:20  <jarib> try this:
2011-05-31T13:04:30  <jarib> prof = Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Profile.from_name "selenium"
2011-05-31T13:04:34  <jarib> prof.secure_ssl = true
2011-05-31T13:04:42  <jarib> driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox, :profile => prof
2011-05-31T13:04:59  <autojack> and yet earlier when I used selenium-client and the server, and started the server with the -firefoxProfileTemplate "path/to/selenium", THAT worked.
2011-05-31T13:05:05  <autojack> ok
2011-05-31T13:05:18  <jarib> webdriver overrides the default certificate handling
2011-05-31T13:05:21  <jarib> which should work
2011-05-31T13:05:36  <jarib> if you *really* want to manage the certificates yourself, you want to turn secure_ssl *on*
2011-05-31T13:05:56  <autojack> that worked!
2011-05-31T13:06:01  <jarib> ok, now
2011-05-31T13:06:12  <jarib> try this:
2011-05-31T13:06:19  <jarib> prof = Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Profile.new
2011-05-31T13:06:24  *** codemonkey4php has left #selenium
2011-05-31T13:06:27  <jarib> prof.assume_untrusted_certificate_issuer = false
2011-05-31T13:06:38  <jarib> driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox, :profile => prof
2011-05-31T13:06:44  <jarib> notice .new instead of .from_name
2011-05-31T13:07:14  <jarib> and that you're leaving secure_ssl as-is

2011-05-31T16:08:07  <autojack> how do you expect it to test with no GUI then?
2011-05-31T16:08:09  <autojack> :)
2011-05-31T16:08:13  <autojack> that's what it's complaining about.
2011-05-31T16:08:17  <autojack> it wants to launch a browser.
2011-05-31T16:08:19  <xeodox> right
2011-05-31T16:08:28  <autojack> that's not going to work if there's no X11
2011-05-31T16:08:38  <xeodox> what about xvfb?
2011-05-31T16:08:44  <autojack> I don't know what that is.

2011-05-31T16:13:23  *** cakehero has quit IRC
2011-05-31T16:15:51  <autojack> depends on how you use Selenium.
2011-05-31T16:16:04  <autojack> I just learned today that using webdriver + ruby, you don't need the server.
2011-05-31T16:16:13  <autojack> or maybe webdriver + anything
2011-05-31T16:16:34  <xeodox> ah okk
2011-05-31T16:17:09  <autojack> but if you are just ssh'ing into a server that's running X11 I don't think you can just run tests from the command line that way.
2011-05-31T16:17:23  <xeodox> there is a way, using Xvfb
2011-05-31T16:17:27  <autojack> mmm
2011-05-31T16:17:28  <xeodox> which runs the gui in memory
2011-05-31T16:18:55  <autojack> have you seen http://railstech.com/2011/03/selenium-in-headless-with-xvfb-under-ruby/
2011-05-31T16:19:10  <autojack> this line: s1 = Selenium::WebDriver::Remote.new :url => "http://localhost:4444/wb/pub"
2011-05-31T16:19:15  <autojack> would make it use your local Selenium server
2011-05-31T16:19:26  <autojack> which then I think might work with Xvfb
2011-05-31T16:21:27  <xeodox> s1 = Selenium::WebDriver::Remote.new :url => "http://localhost:4444/wb/pub"
