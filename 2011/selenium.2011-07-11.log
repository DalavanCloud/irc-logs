2011-07-11T02:06:41  <AutomatedTester> we can call start but then the next call fails

2011-07-11T03:52:33  <adamgoucher> davehunt AutomatedTester - can either of you confirm (bad use of the word) that window.confirm() cannot be overridden in ff >= 4? (per http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1604 comment)
2011-07-11T03:55:45  <adamgoucher> nevermind...
2011-07-11T04:01:01  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: its JS, you can override most things
2011-07-11T04:01:17  <adamgoucher> ya. i figured it out
2011-07-11T04:01:36  <adamgoucher> and trying to see an alert inside your overridden alert code also doesnt work
2011-07-11T04:02:00  <adamgoucher>     if (!self.windowNeedsModifying(windowToModify, browserBot.uniqueId)) {
2011-07-11T04:02:00  <adamgoucher>         return;
2011-07-11T04:02:00  <adamgoucher>     }
2011-07-11T04:02:21  <adamgoucher> is why alerts/confirms is busted in ide/rc
2011-07-11T04:03:17  <mdirkse> is there a way to save tests from the IDE in the new webdriver api format (ie not using the webdriver backend for the old api)?
2011-07-11T04:03:22  <adamgoucher> comment that out and it works

2011-07-11T04:05:18  <samit> adamgoucher: the problem with this is that it will keep modifying the window all the time. Someone broke the detection logic.
2011-07-11T04:05:24  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: hmmm, make sure you run the RC tests when you have a fix
2011-07-11T04:06:01  <adamgoucher> samit: i walked through the logic and its doing exactly what it claims to want to do

2011-07-11T04:07:26  <adamgoucher> samit: ya; all it does is check if it is firefox >= 40b1 and then whether the alert method of the window is [native code]
2011-07-11T04:07:40  <samit> adamgoucher: Thats the broken one
2011-07-11T04:08:57  <adamgoucher> i think we're overusing the term broken. how/why is it broken?

2011-07-11T04:22:52  <adamgoucher> i suspect for an se-ide only fix, https://gist.github.com/274958 from hugs would do the trick
2011-07-11T04:24:48  <samit> I think I found the problem

2011-07-11T04:52:09  <samit> atleast the windows one doesn't

2011-07-11T04:54:45  <AutomatedTester> ok cool

2011-07-11T04:55:55  <samit> AutomatedTester: that too. I spent some time trying to figure why it was not.
2011-07-11T04:56:46  <adamgoucher> so, in theory, if the window is a firefox one and window.alert.tostring says 'native code' then we need to stomp on it with our code; correct?
2011-07-11T04:56:46  <samit> AutomatedTester: The installer can do with some improvements, it did not even setup the env variables :-(
2011-07-11T04:57:50  <adamgoucher> samit: ah, but env variable setting is evil; especially those [of us] with 6 or 7 versions of python on the machine :)
2011-07-11T04:58:04  <samit> adamgoucher: correct. but that is not the problem
2011-07-11T04:58:56  * samit wonders if more fists are shaken in the direction of europe
2011-07-11T04:59:26  <adamgoucher> more boggled looks
2011-07-11T05:00:19  <samit> adamgoucher: an option to set the env vars or not in the installer would have been welcome.

2011-07-11T05:37:27  <AutomatedTester> The only reason I can think is that is the JS Scope chain is growing and the dictionary is having to check something is there and replacing its value with each command

2011-07-11T06:01:49  <adamgoucher> rats! was hoping alerts was busted in python too. nope. just se-ide; the forgotten step child of the selenium project
2011-07-11T06:02:42  <barancev> adamgoucher: which is better -- phpunit's rc bindings or pear's ?
2011-07-11T06:03:31  <adamgoucher> barancev: they both have tradeoffs; the phpunit one wants you to build things its way, and pear's has a couple stupid bugs in it (like not checking if there is an error from the server)

2011-07-11T06:56:21  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: guessing you would prefer new rc tests to be similar to the webdriver ones rather than pyunit?
2011-07-11T06:56:23  <samit> adamgoucher: My opinion is that if checking a flag on the window object has race issues, so would any other flag like the one you propose.

2011-07-11T07:00:54  <simonstewart> It'd be really, really useful if we can start gathering some data showing which companies are using selenium
2011-07-11T07:00:54  * adamgoucher wonders how many threads simonstewart can juggle before he starts a queue system :)
2011-07-11T07:01:04  <samit> simonstewart  adamgoucher I am simply saying that Simon put that native code check for a reason.
2011-07-11T07:01:33  <jimevans> how supportive is "very supportive"?
2011-07-11T07:01:49  <simonstewart> It's not a native check. It's a check to see if we're in firefox chrome mode in version 4 or more

2011-07-11T07:02:44  <ian_mac_> supporting data for what?

2011-07-11T07:03:17  <simonstewart> We get anecdotal data, like the >1100 downloads of the .Net bindings in 3 days
2011-07-11T07:03:22  <ian_mac_> right
2011-07-11T07:03:40  <simonstewart> but something like "Google, Company X, Company Y and Z" also use selenium

2011-07-11T07:03:52  <ian_mac_> yeah

2011-07-11T07:23:58  <adamgoucher> simonstewart: popups work with firefox, and firefoxproxy. do not work with se-ide

2011-07-11T07:24:33  <simonstewart> When tests are executing
2011-07-11T07:24:38  <simonstewart> They're both in the same context
2011-07-11T07:25:31  <adamgoucher> likely how the scripts are loaded; we never get to the point where the override of alerts, etc. happens

2011-07-11T07:25:43  <simonstewart> even more odd

2011-07-11T07:28:00  <simonstewart> wow
2011-07-11T07:28:01  <ato> jarib: Interesting.

2011-07-11T07:29:08  <adamgoucher> simonstewart: could be because se-ide has its own runner
2011-07-11T07:29:28  <simonstewart> perhaps the problem lies there rather than in the bowels of the code?

2011-07-11T07:30:06  <samit> simonstewart  return win.alert.toString().indexOf("native code") != -1; //I think this is a check if the alert method has been overloaded with js or firefox native code.
2011-07-11T07:30:36  <samit> simonstewart  the problem is that IDE already replaces the alert method
2011-07-11T07:30:59  <mdirkse> ok, let me rephrase the question, as I can't find the page I was on earlier: is there any sample code for the webdriver stuff other than what's on the wiki?
2011-07-11T07:31:14  <simonstewart> Then IDE should also add another flag to make it clear
2011-07-11T07:31:35  <mdirkse> jimevans: got it, http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RoadMap
2011-07-11T07:31:38  <mdirkse> last item in the list
2011-07-11T07:31:54  <simonstewart> We should really update that.

2011-07-11T07:32:03  <jimevans> simonstewart: indeed.
2011-07-11T07:32:04  <simonstewart> *sigh*
2011-07-11T07:32:28  <samit> simonstewart  so back to my first question why does the original flag (!win[uniqueId]) not work?

2011-07-11T07:40:04  <simonstewart> nirvdrum might
2011-07-11T07:40:07  <simonstewart> Why?
2011-07-11T07:40:11  <ian_mac_> is that some sort of session timeout thing that will automatically close the browser?
2011-07-11T07:40:11  <simonstewart> What's the problem?
2011-07-11T07:40:15  <ian_mac_> well
2011-07-11T07:40:21  <ian_mac_> sometimes if my test fails
2011-07-11T07:40:22  <mdirkse> just wanted to say: this webdriver stuff is very slick. congrats on the 2.0 release to the team
2011-07-11T07:40:27  <ian_mac_> +1
2011-07-11T07:40:30  <nirvdrum> ian_mac_: Is it problematic for you?
2011-07-11T07:40:32  <simonstewart> Thanks :)
2011-07-11T07:40:33  <ian_mac_> the browser ends up hanging
2011-07-11T07:40:46  <ian_mac_> nirvdrum - no, I was hoping it would solve a problem
2011-07-11T07:41:02  <ian_mac_> because there doesn't seem to be any browser garbage collection
2011-07-11T07:41:13  <nirvdrum> ian_mac_: The problem it's designed to address is when a client makes a request, queues up on the grid, and then the client times out.
2011-07-11T07:41:16  <ian_mac_> but maybe I have to build more into my test setup
2011-07-11T07:41:25  <ian_mac_> nirvdrum - I see
2011-07-11T07:41:29  <nirvdrum> As soon as a node is available, the hub forwards the request on.  But there's no client to write the response to.
2011-07-11T07:41:34  <ian_mac_> right
2011-07-11T07:41:47  <ian_mac_> so that's something different
2011-07-11T07:41:47  <davehunt> adamgoucher: I think I've asked before, but do you have the rejection details for Selenium IDE on addons.mozilla.org ?
2011-07-11T07:41:56  <nirvdrum> So, that session effectively is now orphaned.  It's in use as far as the hub is concerned, but no one's actually using it.
2011-07-11T07:42:05  <ian_mac_> ok
2011-07-11T07:42:16  <nirvdrum> Normally you'd have to wait your full timeout period.  But that's kinda wasteful.
2011-07-11T07:42:31  <ian_mac_> so I'm not using grid
2011-07-11T07:42:35  <mdirkse> simonstewart: I learned about this whole 2.0 thing from the podcast you and Jason did with Andy Glover. That was good stuff.
2011-07-11T07:42:39  <ian_mac_> so that doesn't affect me
2011-07-11T07:42:45  <nirvdrum> So, as a heuristic I check if any commands are sent after the start session.  If not, after some threshold (5s I think), the session is automatically reaped.
2011-07-11T07:42:46  <ian_mac_> (yet)
2011-07-11T07:42:56  *** tunabum has joined #selenium
2011-07-11T07:43:25  <ian_mac_> right
2011-07-11T07:43:30  <nirvdrum> ian_mac_: I guess it could have been pushed into selenium server.  But I've personally only observed it being a problem in grid, particularly because the connection between the server and client can take a while.
2011-07-11T07:43:44  <ian_mac_> well
2011-07-11T07:43:50  <ian_mac_> the case I'm dealing with
2011-07-11T07:43:53  <ian_mac_> is having say
2011-07-11T07:44:03  <ian_mac_> 6 copies of Google Chrome open
2011-07-11T07:44:07  <ian_mac_> and just hanging around
2011-07-11T07:44:21  <ian_mac_> b/c they didn't get closed after the tests were run
2011-07-11T07:44:32  <ian_mac_> but I probably need to solve that in my test runner

2011-07-11T08:06:46  <jarib> ian_mac_: it's more to make sure you won't commit anything that breaks :)
2011-07-11T08:06:56  <simonstewart> samit: the race condition is to do with the mozilla inner/outer window bug
2011-07-11T08:06:59  <ian_mac_> I was kidding

2011-07-11T08:08:28  <jimevans> random question: does chrome support showModalDialog()? I ask because it *is* specified in the HTML5 spec after all.
2011-07-11T08:08:33  <simonstewart> :)
2011-07-11T08:08:42  <simonstewart> random answer: I'm not sure
2011-07-11T08:08:50  <simonstewart> It might well bring up a non-modal window

2011-07-11T08:11:11  <simonstewart> Surely we should not block on window opening?

2011-07-11T09:36:50  <Radhad> jarib, I have foudn out that the javascript removes a CSS class of an element, which changes the visibillity after page load
2011-07-11T09:37:04  <samit> ian_mac_: I kind of missed the context. but, in general you are right - it does not. But it also fills a niche where it is very valuable.
2011-07-11T09:37:18  <Radhad> the element seems to exist when document.onload is fired
2011-07-11T09:37:44  <ian_mac_> it is very valuable in its niche, I guess
2011-07-11T09:38:00  <ian_mac_> I don't understand how people use it in a sustainable way though
2011-07-11T09:38:15  <Radhad> waiting 1 sec doesn't change the value for element.getAttribute("class")
2011-07-11T09:38:23  <adamgoucher> ya. it cant read minds and so cant produce page objects
2011-07-11T09:38:45  <samit> ian_mac_: You cannot. Thats why you move to other tools in the Selenium suite.
2011-07-11T09:38:59  <ian_mac_> indeed.  I'm well aware of that
2011-07-11T09:39:01  <Radhad> is there a way to reload DOM in webdriver?

2011-07-11T09:39:48  <jarib> Radhad: you don't want to reload - you want to wait for the DOM to be in the state required for interacting with it
2011-07-11T09:39:55  <ian_mac_> apparently so
2011-07-11T09:40:27  <ian_mac_> I think the IDE is a really good appetizer tool

2011-07-11T09:41:00  <Radhad> I can wait 50 seconds, but webdriver shows me that the element still has a class which hides the element - but this class has been removed milliseconds after document.onload
2011-07-11T09:41:09  <ian_mac_> and prepares you for the main course (Webdriver/RC)
2011-07-11T09:41:11  <adamgoucher> the problem is people who only eat off the appetizer menu
2011-07-11T09:41:12  <adamgoucher> :)
2011-07-11T09:41:21  <samit> ian_mac_: It is. a large percentage of people begin their journey through test automation using it.
2011-07-11T09:41:33  <ian_mac_> well, is that a problem?
2011-07-11T09:42:09  <jarib> Radhad: WebDriver looks at the DOM every time you call getAttribute(), it doesn't save any state itself

2011-07-11T11:59:21  <ian_mac_> yes, so far I'm liking webdriver vs. selenium, though there are some adjustments
2011-07-11T12:01:51  *** mashiara has joined #selenium
2011-07-11T12:07:11  <jimevans> ian_mac_: I'm really glad to hear that. I've always hated the Selenium RC API.
2011-07-11T12:12:45  <ian_mac_> I never had any issue with the RC API
2011-07-11T12:13:24  <ian_mac_> though webdriver seems simpler
2011-07-11T12:13:27  <jimevans> I always found it so procedural as to be distracting and in contrast with OO programming principles.
2011-07-11T12:14:03  <ian_mac_> there is that
2011-07-11T12:14:28  <ian_mac_> my main reservation would be that it seems likely that it will be a lot harder to support additional browsers
2011-07-11T12:14:42  <ian_mac_> whereas with selenium this was likely a lot easier
2011-07-11T12:14:48  <ian_mac_> though I suppose that is a tradeoff
2011-07-11T12:16:34  *** antlong has quit IRC
2011-07-11T12:17:14  <adamgoucher> jimevans: so one down and a whole lot more to go  :) (re api names)
2011-07-11T12:17:22  <jimevans> I like the compactness of the WebDriver API.
2011-07-11T12:17:25  <ian_mac_> and dropping PHP support is obviously not a happy thing, but people have stepped up
2011-07-11T12:17:26  <jimevans> :)
2011-07-11T12:17:31  <ian_mac_> yes
2011-07-11T12:18:37  <ian_mac_> the compactness is nice
2011-07-11T12:18:42  <ian_mac_> less API to learn
2011-07-11T12:18:44  <jimevans> ian_mac_: true, and with the pervasiveness of the json wire protocol, any language that includes an http client library and a json parser can quickly develop a language binding.
2011-07-11T12:19:11  <adamgoucher> there was never really any php support. even in rc; everyone used phpunit and it had a different implementation
2011-07-11T12:19:54  <ian_mac_> adamgoucher - true, though before there were instructions listed on seleniumhq.com and it appeared there was PHP support
2011-07-11T12:20:05  <ian_mac_> because there was something there and it worked
2011-07-11T12:20:27  <adamgoucher> yup. sehq is not a good oracle to the world though
2011-07-11T12:20:55  <jimevans> sehq needs an overhaul.
2011-07-11T12:21:11  <jimevans> not that i'm volunteering (he hastens to add)
2011-07-11T12:21:40  <ian_mac_> anyway, it will be interesting to see which PHP binding becomes the de facto standard
2011-07-11T12:22:54  <adamgoucher> i keep meaning to do the overhaul. but an 'adam' overhaul might mean something very different than what someone else thinks
2011-07-11T12:23:26  <RossPatterson> I'd feel better about the Selenium WebDriver API (see, Adam?) if I didn't keep reading advice that includes "cast the foo object to a bar and then ..." (where foo seems to usually be WebElement).  Somehow that just seems wrong on a lot of levels, OO included.
2011-07-11T12:24:16  <adamgoucher> two converted! a banner day!
2011-07-11T12:24:42  <RossPatterson> Nah, I've bene in your camp since day 1 :-)
2011-07-11T12:26:15  <RossPatterson> s/bene/been/
2011-07-11T12:26:25  <ian_mac_> is Selenium WebDriver the proper name?
2011-07-11T12:26:40  <ian_mac_> what are we supposed to call it?
2011-07-11T12:26:49  <adamgoucher> there is 'selenium' the project
2011-07-11T12:27:00  <adamgoucher> version 2.0 of the project was just released
2011-07-11T12:27:03  <ian_mac_> yeah
2011-07-11T12:27:06  * RossPatterson backs away from the can of worms that's wobbling in the middle of the room.
2011-07-11T12:27:07  <ian_mac_> I'm aware of that
2011-07-11T12:27:14  <adamgoucher> in version 2.0 there are two apis: selenium remote control and selenium webdriver
2011-07-11T12:27:20  <ian_mac_> ok
2011-07-11T12:27:28  <ian_mac_> so RC API or WebDriver API?
2011-07-11T12:27:32  <adamgoucher> yes
2011-07-11T12:28:09  <adamgoucher> 2.0 != webdriver
2011-07-11T12:28:13  <RossPatterson> Shudder: http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/GmehBwaneBE/Stanford-CS101-Adopts-JavaScript

2011-07-11T12:29:16  <ian_mac_> will RC eventually be deprecated?
2011-07-11T12:29:26  <adamgoucher> yes. it is rather deprecated already
2011-07-11T12:29:42  <ian_mac_> well has it been marked as such?
2011-07-11T12:29:45  <adamgoucher> (as in people will get /really/ cranky if the api gets much loving)
2011-07-11T12:29:58  <ian_mac_> or is that unofficial?
2011-07-11T12:30:44  <RossPatterson> Gotta run to the bus.  Aloha!
2011-07-11T12:30:54  <adamgoucher> no. its formal. it has been decreed publicly that the api is 'frozen' but bug fixes, browser versions, etc. will be accommodated as much as possible

2011-07-11T12:31:31  <adamgoucher> there also needs to be a nice migration (not upgrade!) path from rc -> webdriver in all four languages; i think right now it only exists in java and c#

2011-07-11T12:32:35  <ian_mac_> right
2011-07-11T12:33:09  <ian_mac_> Would accept patches for that but won't do it myself. Don't think that driving Selenium from PHPUnit is a good idea anymore tbh
2011-07-11T12:33:14  <ian_mac_> what do you think about that?
2011-07-11T12:33:24  <adamgoucher> all that said, /i/ think that the rc bindings should be updated to deprecate things like get_value, add implicit waits, etc.
2011-07-11T12:33:45  <adamgoucher> dunno. but its nice that hes not further muddying the php world

2011-07-11T12:34:53  <ian_mac_> to blur the separation can be confusing IMO
2011-07-11T12:34:55  <adamgoucher> the pear bindings are nicer from a control perspective, but other than that, suck

2011-07-11T12:45:26  <adamgoucher> re webdriver - the biggest thing with current clients is the lack of migration path in python/ruby (i dont take java or c# clients) -- but understand the holdup
2011-07-11T12:46:25  <jimevans> well, i understand your point there, but we've had that discussion before. :)

2011-07-11T13:08:45  <jimevans> yes, the http server and dispatch mechanism. possibly the json parser and the utf-8 encoder.
2011-07-11T13:08:47  *** antlong has quit IRC
2011-07-11T13:09:45  <jimevans> the ie and chrome implementations use different versions of mongoose, so the dispatch mechanism is slightly different.
2011-07-11T13:10:49  <jimevans> i guess i don't know how deeply intertwined with the chromium code the utf-8 and json processors are
2011-07-11T13:10:56  <jimevans> (though i imagine quite a bit)
2011-07-11T13:13:16  <kkania> jimevans: yes, it is nice to develop in chromium where you can use all the base utils; i don't think it would be too difficult to grab and build base yourself, but I'm not completely sure
2011-07-11T13:13:55  <kkania> jimevans: they keep adding more things that base depends on, and they do quite a bit of refactoring that you would have to keep up on

2011-07-11T13:38:49  <jimevans> santiycr: it looks to me like you're not returning values from javascript.
2011-07-11T13:39:11  <jimevans> javascriptexecutor wraps your script inside an anonymous function before executing.
2011-07-11T13:39:50  <jimevans> so to return 2 from 1+1, you'd do ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("return 1+1;");

2011-07-11T13:49:25  <santiycr> I was missing the return, as well as a semicolon at the end

2011-07-11T13:50:14  <__phil__> hi all, I'm trying to figure out how to teach IE 9 and/or Selenium RC to remember my login for a website so I don't need to store that info in my test code.  The only info I've found was in the Selenium google group and it says IE should remember the info (and it's not).  Help?
2011-07-11T13:50:14  <santiycr> I did see some examples suggesting that just running ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("document.title") would work
2011-07-11T13:50:27  <santiycr> will see if I find them in the repo and fix them
2011-07-11T13:53:32  <eagles> with selenium 2.0, can i get the HTTP response of a request?

2011-07-11T14:11:08  <__phil__> ian_mac_ you would store the login credentials for an administrator in source code?

2011-07-11T14:14:54  <ian_mac_> __phil__ - it has to be stored somewhere
2011-07-11T14:15:20  <ian_mac_> but I wouldn't store them in the repo
2011-07-11T14:15:24  <__phil__> ian_mac_ I agree.  I was just hoping it would be stored in the browser when I clicked the "remember me" checkbox
2011-07-11T14:15:53  <__phil__> ian_mac_ and then it would remember it for me the next time I ran the same test on the same browser on the same PC.
2011-07-11T14:16:52  <__phil__> ian_mac_ is this the config file to which you refer: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Selenium_Configuration#Configure_Selenium_using_a_configuration_file

2011-07-11T14:25:56  <polm> Are some clicks more equal than others?
2011-07-11T14:26:15  <polm> There's a link in the browser that triggers a javascript event when hit
2011-07-11T14:26:20  <polm> If I actually click it, no problem
2011-07-11T14:26:25  <polm> If selenium click it, nothing happens.
2011-07-11T14:26:46  <polm> I'm confirming I have the right link by printing the text of it before I click it.
2011-07-11T14:27:31  <polm> Also, using VNC and monitoring selenium, the link is at least moused over (I'm talking to the designer, but unfortunately the :hover style is the same as :active style for this link)
2011-07-11T14:30:19  *** kkania has left #selenium
2011-07-11T14:34:31  <__phil__> ian_mac_ if so how do I configure the selenium server to read the file and input that exact data into the webform?

2011-07-11T15:10:07  <adamgoucher> polm: yes. 'click' sends a click event to the dom which may/may not actually fire js. i write a 'real_click' function which does a mouse_down, mouse_up which sometimes works more effectively
2011-07-11T15:11:54  <adamgoucher> __phil__: i wouldnt store the credentials in the repo (well, not for production; for anything else, why not?) but have an example config file where you would have to put them in by hand before you run things. by hand is the important (valuable) part as it makes people think
2011-07-11T15:13:44  <__phil__> adamgoucher please elaborate. http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Selenium_Configuration#Configure_Selenium_using_a_configuration_file describes including a config file as a param when starting up selenium server, but how does one write a selenium test to say to the server "go to the config file, get the username, and put it in the form input field name 'username'"?
2011-07-11T15:14:15  <adamgoucher> thats part of their framework, not selenium
2011-07-11T15:14:40  <adamgoucher> RunSeleniumTests.php is a runner implementation (much like phpunit is one)
2011-07-11T15:14:51  <__phil__> adamgoucher so how do I tell the selenium server where to find the config file?
2011-07-11T15:15:39  <adamgoucher> you don't. the server doesnt care. its all in their runner
2011-07-11T15:16:26  <adamgoucher> and by server i mean 'the selenium server'
2011-07-11T15:16:51  <__phil__> so you're suggesting to keep a config file on the client that is not in the repo and have the selenium code retrieve the info from the file that way
2011-07-11T15:17:39  <adamgoucher> the selenium code is only that which controls the browser. as part of your runner/xunit-ish code you would consume the file and do with what you want
