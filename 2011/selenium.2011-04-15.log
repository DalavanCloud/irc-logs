2011-04-15T06:00:43  <ygerasimov> alright jarib
2011-04-15T06:01:04  <ygerasimov> so my problem is I see the way to implement http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol in PHP
2011-04-15T06:01:14  <freynaud> Y
2011-04-15T06:01:21  <ygerasimov> i.e. to build binding for webdriver in php
2011-04-15T06:02:03  <ygerasimov> my question is what is Firefox Driver in documentation as I really need to change User Agent from PHP?
2011-04-15T06:03:01  <ygerasimov> is it another way to connect to webdriver or something?
2011-04-15T06:03:23  <ygerasimov> or is it separate project and I should run another .jar file and connect to it?
2011-04-15T06:03:58  <ygerasimov> can someone explain this thing as looks I got lost
2011-04-15T06:04:10  <jarib> you'll need to pass a serialized profile to the remote server, as part of the desired capabilities
2011-04-15T06:05:07  <ygerasimov> ah... that is interesting
2011-04-15T06:05:46  <ygerasimov> jarib, do you mean to pass name of profile or I can send somehow only my needed property?
2011-04-15T06:06:07  <ygerasimov> and is there any documentation to look at?
2011-04-15T06:06:47  <jarib> ygerasimov: if you look at java/ruby we will serialize the profile (basically only the prefs.js file) as a base64-encoded zip string
2011-04-15T06:06:56  <jarib> there's no docs for this except the code AFAIK
2011-04-15T06:07:25  <ygerasimov> sounds great
2011-04-15T06:08:03  *** samuel has joined #selenium
2011-04-15T06:08:12  <jarib> so it's {"firefox_profile": "base64-string"} as part of the desired capabilities
2011-04-15T06:08:31  <ygerasimov> great thanks for help
2011-04-15T06:08:50  <ygerasimov> I will try to look at code and find how to prepare that string

This implementation, while funtionally correct, is not optimal for two reasons: First, the current X,Y coordinates are not stored as a part of the session but on the firefoxDriver instance itself. Second, the current resolution for generating the mouse move events is too low which means the mouse cursor will not end up on the desired coordinates. ...

2011-04-15T11:44:15  <ivog> hi how do i build build\java\client\test\org\openqa\selenium\tests-standalone.jar, i need it to run .net tests
2011-04-15T11:44:53  <ivog> or how can i make sure my go build doesn't abort on the first firefox test failure?

2011-04-15T11:47:15  <jleyba> in RunTests, change haltonerror and haltonfailure to false
2011-04-15T11:47:26  <ivog> ok thx!
2011-04-15T11:47:49  <jleyba> also, for any java target, if you want the standalone jar, append an ":uber" to the build target
2011-04-15T11:48:09  <jleyba> ./go //java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium:selenium -> //java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium:selenium:uber
2011-04-15T11:49:34  <ivog> let me give that a try :)

2011-04-15T13:29:23  <XCulver> I'm having a problem where i'm having to put a sleep(1second) after almost every click(); any idea why?
2011-04-15T13:31:07  <keturn> XCulver: which selenium version?
2011-04-15T13:31:41  *** |izzie has joined #selenium
2011-04-15T13:35:00  *** MikeGrace has quit IRC
2011-04-15T13:35:14  <XCulver> 2 beta 3
2011-04-15T13:37:39  <keturn> hmm, in se1 you had to put waitFor____ calls all over the place, but I thought se2 was supposed to be smarter about that with its implicit waits.  I haven't yet come across good documentation on when you do and don't need explicit waits in se2/webdriver.
2011-04-15T13:39:07  <XCulver> ok
2011-04-15T13:39:16  <XCulver> i was going to use speed() but thats depreceated
2011-04-15T13:39:23  <XCulver> *depreciated
2011-04-15T13:39:36  <XCulver> might have to rig all my clicks to do that
2011-04-15T13:39:41  <XCulver> just bake it in
2011-04-15T13:40:11  <keturn> yeah, generally using sleep or speed will make your tests run a lot slower than they need to.  (because maybe it's only 0.15 seconds they need most of the time)
2011-04-15T13:40:21  *** andytinkham has joined #selenium
2011-04-15T13:40:41  <XCulver> yah
2011-04-15T13:40:43  <XCulver> which i dont mine
2011-04-15T13:40:45  <XCulver> mind
2011-04-15T13:40:46  <keturn> and it'll still fail if something on the server or browser hiccups and makes that operation take 1.01 seconds this time.
2011-04-15T13:40:49  <XCulver> they run on a seperate build
2011-04-15T13:40:53  <XCulver> right
2011-04-15T13:41:05  <XCulver> i'd much rather it was smart enough not to use a set time wait
2011-04-15T13:41:21  <XCulver> i did recently change all my element containers
2011-04-15T13:41:26  <keturn> so the Wait For Load and Wait For Element Visible checks are usually preferrable.
2011-04-15T13:41:34  <XCulver> instead of taking a by.selector
2011-04-15T13:41:40  <XCulver> they take a lambda expression
2011-04-15T13:41:52  <XCulver> so i can have more complex webelement selection
2011-04-15T13:42:31  <antlong> XCulver: set an implicit wait time
2011-04-15T13:42:46  <XCulver> like a search till its found?
2011-04-15T13:43:06  *** eghm_ is now known as eghm
2011-04-15T13:43:18  <antlong> XCulver: the implicit wait class takes a float, and will continue to attempt to run your command until it works, or until it times out
2011-04-15T13:43:24  <XCulver> yah
2011-04-15T13:43:25  <XCulver> i've got that
2011-04-15T13:43:42  <antlong> if you set that, and it still fails then something else is wrong
2011-04-15T13:43:47  <XCulver> yah
2011-04-15T13:43:57  <XCulver> thats exactly what i think
2011-04-15T13:44:02  <XCulver> just not sure what it is
2011-04-15T13:44:27  <antlong> you can make a new test, open google, set implicit wait to 10 seconds, and try to find some (not existant) element
2011-04-15T13:44:36  <antlong> if it waits 10 seconds then fails, you know its not webdriver
2011-04-15T13:44:49  <XCulver> thing is, sometimes it does
2011-04-15T13:44:51  <XCulver> sometimes it doesn't
2011-04-15T13:44:57  <antlong> are you setting it more than once?
2011-04-15T13:45:06  <XCulver> setting what?
2011-04-15T13:45:12  <antlong> the wait time
2011-04-15T13:45:14  <XCulver> no
2011-04-15T13:45:19  <antlong> what language are you using
2011-04-15T13:45:21  <XCulver> its an optional paramater
2011-04-15T13:45:22  <XCulver> c#
2011-04-15T13:45:28  <antlong> its not optional really
2011-04-15T13:45:29  <XCulver> i have it set for 5 secs
2011-04-15T13:45:31  <mattp_> is the purpose of the non remote web driver classes just spawning instance classes (ie open the browser)
2011-04-15T13:45:37  <antlong> its just hardcoded to 1 second unless you pass something in
2011-04-15T13:45:49  <antlong> so if you do pass something in, it will use that instead
2011-04-15T13:46:39  <antlong> mattp_: they act as containers for the parameters needed to instantiate that specific browser. they pass those parameters to the Remote class, which is the `real` class that used

2011-04-15T14:13:38  <XCulver> jimevans: any thoughts of http://codepad.org/IvoPNvNV - its 2 pieces, on is my wait for element method and the other is the property of an element container that holds my selector method
2011-04-15T14:13:57  <XCulver> i'm having problem with it, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't
2011-04-15T14:14:07  <XCulver> i'm havig to put alot of thread.sleeps()
2011-04-15T14:14:29  <XCulver> not just that selector though
2011-04-15T14:14:32  <XCulver> its just an example
2011-04-15T14:15:32  <jimevans> reading it now.

2011-04-15T14:19:20  *** gronky has quit IRC
2011-04-15T14:19:44  <jimevans> i'm confused by your sample code. I don't see anywhere the wait function (ForElement()) is called in your Selector function.
2011-04-15T14:19:51  <jimevans> maybe i don't have enough context.
2011-04-15T14:20:21  <XCulver> hmm
2011-04-15T14:20:46  <XCulver> i'll put together a better example
2011-04-15T14:20:52  <XCulver> wont be now though
2011-04-15T14:21:03  <jimevans> unless the element.Selector method is the one you intend to pass to the ForElement function...
2011-04-15T14:21:45  <XCulver> it is
2011-04-15T14:22:03  <XCulver> its an example of one selector i pass to it
2011-04-15T14:22:03  <jimevans> well, that's your problem then.
2011-04-15T14:22:16  *** toseter has quit IRC
2011-04-15T14:22:17  <XCulver> oh?
2011-04-15T14:22:40  <jimevans> Assuming the FindElement call is the WebDriver FindElement, you need to perform that wait for *every* FindElement call.
2011-04-15T14:22:48  <jimevans> or you might need to.
2011-04-15T14:23:16  <XCulver> ok
2011-04-15T14:23:25  <XCulver> so its failing at one of the earlier findelements
2011-04-15T14:23:32  <jimevans> possibly.
2011-04-15T14:23:34  *** ian_mac_ has quit IRC
2011-04-15T14:23:53  <XCulver> well sometimes it works
2011-04-15T14:23:55  <XCulver> sometimes it doesnt
2011-04-15T14:23:59  <XCulver> with the same selector
2011-04-15T14:24:19  <XCulver> i'll write up a better example though
2011-04-15T14:24:22  <jimevans> incidentally, your ForElement function is functionally identically to calling IOptions.Timeouts.ImplicitlyWait(timespan), then using FindElement()
2011-04-15T14:24:55  <jimevans> s/identically/identical
2011-04-15T14:26:32  <XCulver> jimevans: thanks again for your time
