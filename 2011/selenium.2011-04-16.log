2011-04-16T11:14:44  <charleyb> curious question if anyone's around
2011-04-16T11:15:17  <charleyb> what do you guys use for Se CI and vms?
2011-04-16T11:18:21  <charleyb> openqa is providing vms?
2011-04-16T11:30:17  <AutomatedTester> charleyb: thats a sore point atm
2011-04-16T11:30:31  <AutomatedTester> we "use" bamboo
2011-04-16T11:30:40  <AutomatedTester> and have VMs on a Xserve
2011-04-16T11:30:54  <AutomatedTester> but its stupidly flaky

2011-04-16T11:52:21  <charleyb> AutomatedTester: ok, cool, i googled and found the "tests" :)
2011-04-16T11:52:38  <charleyb> they are a bit of a mess
2011-04-16T11:53:29  <charleyb> i'm poking around for dev and ci box setup for vms for watir
2011-04-16T11:53:54  <charleyb> spurred on by not having ci for a long time
2011-04-16T11:54:17  <charleyb> and needing a win7 or something box that can run ie9 where we're running into issues
2011-04-16T11:54:55  <charleyb> wondering which route to go, ec2 amis or looking at other options
2011-04-16T11:56:10  <AutomatedTester> tests are a bit of a mess?
2011-04-16T11:56:21  <AutomatedTester> charleyb: which tests?
2011-04-16T11:57:39  *** erwandf has joined #selenium
2011-04-16T12:00:09  *** AutomatedTester has quit IRC
2011-04-16T12:02:09  <charleyb> i'm looking at this: http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/start.action
2011-04-16T12:11:53  <jarib> charleyb: there's nothing wrong with the tests though, just that no one is maintaining the VMs/Bamboo
2011-04-16T12:12:32  <jarib> charleyb: you'll find some recent discussion about this on the selenium-dev list
2011-04-16T12:13:53  <charleyb> yeah, saw that :)
2011-04-16T12:14:21  <charleyb> jarib: just considering what to do with watir, and hoping there's some info here i can use :)
2011-04-16T12:20:06  <jarib> yeah
2011-04-16T12:21:08  <jarib> i'd say (a) start simple, i.e. with just one browser/OS and let it run for a while to see what issues come up
2011-04-16T12:21:38  <jarib> and (b) find a way to get a clean VM for each build
2011-04-16T12:23:03  <jarib> our approach on the xserve with long-running VMs and lots of browser/os/language permutations is a recipe for disaster

2011-04-16T12:41:06  <charleyb> jarib et al, any way you can start up some additional vms for exactly that purpose? scale back to simple?

2011-04-16T12:45:41  <jarib> i think adam plans to update to bamboo 3 as well
2011-04-16T12:49:38  <charleyb> sounds like it might be a bit much to slam watir on that as well :)
2011-04-16T12:51:58  <jarib> at least in its current state, yeah :/
