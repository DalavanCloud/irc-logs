2011-06-18T00:44:03  <Uday1> I have a RC2 Server. How do I run my passed test case in Firefox with IDE plugin on Selenium RC2..
2011-06-18T00:45:05  <Binken> you shoud export your scripts in IDE
2011-06-18T00:45:30  <Binken> to java, C# or other supported language
2011-06-18T00:46:37  <Uday1> Actually I am testing my client website http://dms.xgate.com.hk
2011-06-18T00:47:12  <Uday1> OK I will Export it to Java because the webpage is designed using Java and PHP.
2011-06-18T00:47:34  <Uday1> After that what should I do?
2011-06-18T00:49:00  <Binken> I don't know aftering exporting what's your scripts like
2011-06-18T00:50:47  <Uday1> I am using Selenium 1.0.11   But there is no option for Java in Export Test case as...
2011-06-18T00:50:54  <Uday1> That is the IDE version..
2011-06-18T00:51:14  <Binken> I think you should fisrt look at the wiki on our official
2011-06-18T00:51:17  <Binken> website
2011-06-18T00:52:09  <Uday1> My test case is simple It logs in ,does some clicks enters some text and Logs out.
2011-06-18T00:52:36  <Binken> yes
2011-06-18T00:52:54  <Binken> You want to use the webdriver API or the selenium 1.0 API?
2011-06-18T00:53:04  <Binken> http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html
2011-06-18T00:53:18  <Binken> You could have a look at this
2011-06-18T00:53:18  <Uday1> I am not using Webdriver
2011-06-18T00:53:23  <Binken> it's a good start

2011-06-18T01:23:14  <Uday> Can you help me in this query..
2011-06-18T01:23:33  <Uday> Hi Nitin
2011-06-18T01:39:41  <Uday> Hi Mayank,Nitin Any of you worked in Selenium RC2....
2011-06-18T01:40:23  <Mayank> Uday: I am still a beginner, what is the problem that you are facing?
2011-06-18T01:42:00  <Uday> Hi Mayank  I recorded a simple test cases using Firefox and Selinium Plugin IDE.
2011-06-18T01:42:04  <Uday> That was for one website.
2011-06-18T01:42:24  <Mayank> yes, then?
2011-06-18T01:42:30  <Uday> Now I want to run that test case in Selenium RC2 Server..
2011-06-18T01:44:16  <Uday> I am trying to export it to Java but there is no option to export it to java.
2011-06-18T01:44:17  <Mayank> ok, you can export them as HTML / Junit, or any of ure languages. and then start the server from the terminal like -> java -jar selenium-server-rc2.jar
2011-06-18T01:44:34  *** nitin has quit IRC
2011-06-18T01:46:04  <Mayank> for instance if you are using HTML, then make a test suite .html and then use the following - java -jar selenium-server-standalone-rc2.jar -port porTNo -htmsuite "*yourBrowser" "http://website.com" "/path/to/testsuite"
2011-06-18T01:46:14  <Uday> For Java Shall I export it to Java ,Junit or Test NG
2011-06-18T01:46:50  <Mayank> Java
2011-06-18T01:47:28  <Uday> Can you tell for Java as my website is coded in Java...
2011-06-18T01:47:29  <Mayank> and if you are interested in Java based tests, then you can configure Eclipse IDE, and run your tests directly from there
2011-06-18T01:47:51  <Mayank> there are a number of tutorials/videos available.
2011-06-18T01:47:57  <Mayank> for configuring
2011-06-18T01:48:04  <Mayank> infact the Selenium docs too.
2011-06-18T01:48:57  <Uday> EClipse IDE Is it a Plugin like Selenium IDE...
2011-06-18T01:50:10  <Mayank> No, it is what you use to write programs and other cool stuff
2011-06-18T01:52:43  <Uday> See Mayank The program is created by the Selenium IDE.  I want to run it in RC2 server.My website is coded in Java .Is it possible or not to run it in RC2 Server using Selenium IDE 1.0.11
2011-06-18T01:53:35  <Mayank> you can use selenium IDE itself to run those tests
2011-06-18T01:54:46  <Uday> Then how will I export it to Java
2011-06-18T01:57:35  <Uday> I think Exporting to Java should be possible using Selinium IDE right either to JUNIT,TestNG.
2011-06-18T01:58:23  <Uday> What is testNG used for because my manager was mentioning some reports to be obtained in reportNG
2011-06-18T02:00:30  <Uday> Hi Mayank Do you think I am going wrong somewhere...
2011-06-18T02:01:58  <Mayank> I am not very sure of testNG, you can export them to Junit 3 or 4. Which company are you working for here in India? <if you dont mind>

2011-06-18T02:20:58  <Uday> OK After exporting to Junit3 or 4should I copy that file and ftp it to the RC server...

2011-06-18T06:51:36  <Uday1318> Is that correct..
2011-06-18T06:51:43  <Owner_> Then you should have all the Java code you need.
2011-06-18T06:51:52  <Owner_> Compile and run that
2011-06-18T06:52:16  <Uday1318> The exported file contains the Java code right...

2011-06-18T06:54:39  <Uday1318> Yeah I did look at it It looks like an OOP code.But lots of Selenium commands so I am not sure it is java code..

2011-06-18T16:30:21  <afajfa> hi everyone
2011-06-18T16:30:40  <afajfa> can someone see what's wrong with my selenium2 grid setup? can't view hub console in my browser.
2011-06-18T16:30:41  <afajfa> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6399586/selenium-2-hub-starts-but-throws-404-when-trying-to-access-console

2011-06-18T16:37:01  <afajfa> anyone??
2011-06-18T16:37:24  <rpk> no idea, and freynaud hasn't been in here in a while
2011-06-18T16:41:48  <afajfa> I mean it was working fine yesterday
2011-06-18T16:42:03  <afajfa> and then stopped both the hub and webdriver node
2011-06-18T16:42:08  <afajfa> on each respective boxes
2011-06-18T16:42:22  <rpk> oh, so it used to work?
2011-06-18T16:42:26  <rpk> with the same jars?
2011-06-18T16:42:40  <afajfa> yup
2011-06-18T16:42:42  <afajfa> exact same
2011-06-18T16:42:49  <afajfa> nothing has changed on the server...
2011-06-18T16:42:59  <afajfa> which is why I feel frustrated
2011-06-18T16:42:59  <rpk> and you've tried restarting it three times? :P
2011-06-18T16:43:06  <afajfa> well I've killed all PID
2011-06-18T16:43:40  <afajfa> the hub seems to run but it keeps returning 404 when I try to access
2011-06-18T16:43:43  <afajfa> the console and such
2011-06-18T16:44:50  <afajfa> at one point I thought my host was making my life difficult becasue Ididn't pay the hosting bill on time :)
2011-06-18T16:45:35  <afajfa> argh....going for a smoke

2011-06-18T17:04:36  <Owner_> Has anyone gotten Selenium to work with Flex?
2011-06-18T17:33:34  <adamgoucher> look at the flex pilot project
2011-06-18T17:40:17  <Owner_> thanks
2011-06-18T17:41:56  <Owner_> adamgoucher: If it really works for me, I'll be so happy.
2011-06-18T17:43:27  <adamgoucher> i havent used it much but ive been on projects where it worked really well
2011-06-18T17:45:24  <rpk> hey adamgoucher.  I wanted to build an OSS test management program that works with selenium.  Would you think it might be more useful with .net and iis, or jvm based webservers?
2011-06-18T17:46:08  <adamgoucher> dunno. test management systems are kinda useless with selenium i think. just check them into version control
2011-06-18T17:46:37  <adamgoucher> (but depends on your target audience -- oss that runs on a pay platform seems kinda silly personally)
2011-06-18T17:47:02  <rpk> theres no way to get and track results, set up tests, deploy products to test against
2011-06-18T17:47:37  <rpk> essentially do what bromine does, but meet a slightly different use case, and have a better license
2011-06-18T17:47:43  <adamgoucher> just use jenkins
2011-06-18T17:48:52  <rpk> You'd need 5-6 plugins that all worked nicely together
2011-06-18T17:49:14  <adamgoucher> so... as compared to yet another system?
2011-06-18T17:49:51  <rpk> one that came wholesale?  yeah.  also I would intend that this supported execution of tests outside of your CI
2011-06-18T17:50:15  <adamgoucher> plus a new system would have the effect of further splitting the delivery of information (which should be consolidated, not split)
2011-06-18T17:50:52  <adamgoucher> why would you run anything outside of the ci environment? other than for fun... if its not run via ci it never happened
2011-06-18T17:51:08  <rpk> say you were writing tests locally, and wanted to execute before checking in?
2011-06-18T17:51:50  <adamgoucher> sure. but your local runs dont amount to the proverbial hill of beans
2011-06-18T17:52:20  <rpk> yeah, but you don't have the environments to run against
2011-06-18T17:52:44  <rpk> additionally, I'd very much like for developers to be able to push new builds out before committing, and execute the test suite against them
2011-06-18T17:53:17  <afajfa> can someone see why I can't access selenium console? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6399586/selenium-2-hub-starts-but-throws-404-when-trying-to-access-console
2011-06-18T17:53:41  <adamgoucher> jenkins can handle the second for you
2011-06-18T17:54:10  <adamgoucher> and i would argue that not having environments available is an organizational problem and not a solved-by-a-new-piece-of-software-one
2011-06-18T17:55:40  <rpk> theres a jenkins plugin for private builds?
2011-06-18T17:56:37  <adamgoucher> dunno. i keep private builds private
2011-06-18T18:01:46  <adamgoucher> but you could look at doing pre-commit builds. i dont, but i know they can be done through jenkins
