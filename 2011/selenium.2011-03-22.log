2011-03-22T02:53:48  <AutomatedTester> jarib: you there?
2011-03-22T02:57:09  <jarib> AutomatedTester: yep
2011-03-22T02:57:25  <AutomatedTester> do you support people giving a named profile in ruby
2011-03-22T02:57:30  <jarib> yes
2011-03-22T02:57:32  <AutomatedTester> instead of creating one programmatically
2011-03-22T02:57:47  <jarib> well, they get a Profile instance representing the named profile
2011-03-22T02:58:13  <AutomatedTester> man....
2011-03-22T02:58:15  <jarib> so it's not much different from doing Profile.new, except it's using the named profile as a model
2011-03-22T02:58:35  <jarib> :)
2011-03-22T02:58:51  * AutomatedTester didnt do that for his rewrite
2011-03-22T03:00:04  <jarib> AutomatedTester: all the magic is in Profile#layout_on_disk
2011-03-22T03:00:05  * AutomatedTester just got a saddening email
2011-03-22T03:00:15  <jarib> not mine i hope
2011-03-22T03:00:16  <AutomatedTester> jarib: thanks
2011-03-22T03:00:28  <AutomatedTester> no, SeConf and Mozilla all hands is the same week
2011-03-22T03:00:33  <jarib> ah
2011-03-22T03:00:42  <AutomatedTester> which i have known for a while
2011-03-22T03:00:51  <AutomatedTester> so I was going to going between the 2 sites all week
2011-03-22T03:01:08  <jarib> right
2011-03-22T03:01:16  <AutomatedTester> just got an email saying after the Monday keynote the whole company is going to Las Vegas
2011-03-22T03:01:27  <AutomatedTester> and I cant go
2011-03-22T03:01:34  <jarib> :(
2011-03-22T03:01:42  <AutomatedTester> stupid clash
2011-03-22T03:01:46  <jarib> wow, yeah
2011-03-22T03:08:08  <jarib> AutomatedTester: should i follow up on the libdbus thing somehow, or will you?
2011-03-22T03:09:10  <AutomatedTester> well, is it the proper version or is it one hacked by the debian people?
2011-03-22T03:09:32  <jarib> i downloaded the x86_64 build from ftp.mozilla.org
2011-03-22T03:09:39  <AutomatedTester> oh right
2011-03-22T03:09:40  *** andialbrecht_ is now known as andialbrecht
2011-03-22T03:09:43  <AutomatedTester> in that case raise it
2011-03-22T03:10:06  <jarib> it looks like an exact duplicate of the bug i linked
2011-03-22T03:10:13  <jarib> ok
2011-03-22T03:10:30  <jarib> time for my first ever mozilla bug report
2011-03-22T03:10:42  <AutomatedTester> lemme look at that bug
2011-03-22T03:11:04  <jarib> ok
2011-03-22T03:11:11  <jarib> perhaps re-opening is the proper action?
2011-03-22T03:11:16  <AutomatedTester> raise it linking to the other
2011-03-22T03:11:46  <jarib> k
2011-03-22T03:12:11  <AutomatedTester> if the platform team wanna reopen then they can

2011-03-22T03:22:59  <jarib> heh, funny how bugzilla includes my user agent in the bug report
2011-03-22T03:23:15  <jarib> now everyone can see i'm using chrome :(
2011-03-22T03:24:21  <ato> I investigate Firefox bugs all the time, and I work for Opera. (-:

2011-03-22T03:24:29  <AutomatedTester> jarib: its kinda needed as most people see the problem and report from that browser. You can add your own info
2011-03-22T03:25:01  <jarib> yep :)
2011-03-22T03:25:49  <AutomatedTester> jarib, it might be worth adding info from about:buildconfig to the report
2011-03-22T03:25:54  <AutomatedTester> of that browser
2011-03-22T03:25:59  <jarib> aha
2011-03-22T03:26:45  <AutomatedTester> we try make things easy to find :D

2011-03-22T06:07:29  <stephend|busy> AutomatedTester: sadly, no
2011-03-22T06:07:34  <AutomatedTester> thought so
2011-03-22T06:07:36  <stephend|busy> it just links to the Twitter Party app
2011-03-22T06:07:37  <stephend|busy> :-(
2011-03-22T06:07:49  <simonstewart> so we shouldn't tweet the glow link?

2011-03-22T06:08:12  <stephend|busy> it's just that it doesn't have its own Tweet-this URL
2011-03-22T06:08:15  <simonstewart> Great. I already did :)
2011-03-22T06:08:23  <stephend|busy> ...which would be really useful
2011-03-22T06:08:47  <simonstewart> Coming up to 15,000 downloads already. That's pretty fast
2011-03-22T06:09:39  <stephend|busy> I think we turned on auto-updates, too
2011-03-22T06:09:48  <stephend|busy> which something like 30% of our downloads come from

2011-03-22T06:12:00  <simonstewart> The animation of the glow page in fx4 looks smoother than in chrome 10. Nice work

2011-03-22T06:14:15  <AutomatedTester> JHB has popped up a couple times
2011-03-22T06:14:28  <simonstewart> Wondered whether glow was using push/pop state to update the history bar and enable the back button
2011-03-22T06:14:30  <AutomatedTester> but there isnt much from Africa :(
2011-03-22T06:14:31  <simonstewart> nope
2011-03-22T06:15:23  <stephend|busy> simonstewart: nope, sadly
2011-03-22T06:15:35  <simonstewart> It still looks lovely
2011-03-22T06:19:30  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: thanks for checking in antlong's doc fixes
2011-03-22T06:19:33  <simonstewart> LGTM
2011-03-22T06:20:11  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: they were good, there was one thing that needed fixing which i did myself
2011-03-22T06:21:55  <jimevans> Moz guys: Congrats on FF4 today!
2011-03-22T06:22:04  <simonstewart> +1
2011-03-22T06:22:18  <jimevans> got a crazy-fun/rake question
2011-03-22T06:22:22  <simonstewart> Go for it
2011-03-22T06:22:35  <AutomatedTester> :)
2011-03-22T06:23:08  <jimevans> bear with me; i've got to figure out how to word this properly
2011-03-22T06:23:19  <simonstewart> Summoned for a meeting
2011-03-22T06:23:24  <simonstewart> Back in 30 minutes
2011-03-22T06:23:28  <jimevans> well i'll catch you then.
2011-03-22T06:24:50  <stephend|busy> ty jimevans
2011-03-22T06:25:16  <AutomatedTester> stephend|busy: is the downloads page finished being pushed yet?
2011-03-22T06:25:43  <stephend|busy> someone committed to the prod branch last night, and they have merge conflicts they're working on
2011-03-22T06:25:45  <stephend|busy> :-(
2011-03-22T06:25:47  <stephend|busy> process--
2011-03-22T06:33:47  <melter> i'm using selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar, and i'm seeing "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/common/collect/Lists"
2011-03-22T06:34:46  <melter> is "https://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list" the right place for downloads?
2011-03-22T06:34:50  <jarib> yes
2011-03-22T06:36:16  <melter> http://seleniumhq.org/download/ has 2.0b1, which is older than google's, but has 1.0.10 of the ide, which is newer than the google page
2011-03-22T06:36:23  <jarib> melter: it works here - perhaps an conflicting/old version of the guava libraries are on your classpath?
2011-03-22T06:37:04  <melter> jarib: i don't have guava in my path
2011-03-22T06:37:24  *** RossPatterson has joined #selenium
2011-03-22T06:37:30  <jarib> ok. i'm not a java expert
2011-03-22T06:38:21  <jarib> melter: it doesn't seem to be a bug in the standalone jar packaging though https://gist.github.com/881219
2011-03-22T06:38:51  <jarib> are you running it from an IDE? does it work from the command line?
2011-03-22T06:39:26  <jimevans> in crazy-fun, how do the tasks get the .out property? it's not normally a property of Rake::Task is it?
2011-03-22T06:39:27  *** andialbrecht is now known as andialbrecht_
2011-03-22T06:39:31  <melter> jarib: i get the exact same results
2011-03-22T06:39:39  <melter> command line, from ant
2011-03-22T06:39:45  <jarib> without ant?
2011-03-22T06:39:52  <melter> with ant
2011-03-22T06:39:57  <jarib> try without
2011-03-22T06:40:06  <jarib> also `unset CLASSPATH` just to be sure
2011-03-22T06:40:15  <jarib> (if you're on a *nix-like OS)
2011-03-22T06:41:12  <jarib> jimevans: correct - looks like it's set in rake.rb:28
2011-03-22T06:41:58  <jimevans> ha! thanks.
2011-03-22T06:42:07  <jarib> jimevans: which is possible because of crazy_fun.rb:5
2011-03-22T06:43:04  *** new2b has left #selenium
2011-03-22T06:43:43  <jimevans> jarib: I get it now. Thanks. Can't get to where I want to go from here. Got to try another route.
2011-03-22T06:46:00  <jarib> what is it you want?
2011-03-22T06:46:26  *** Archdude has joined #selenium
2011-03-22T06:46:47  <jimevans> i'm trying to migrate the creation of the .net docs into a crazy-fun task.
2011-03-22T06:47:30  <jimevans> problem is that the build tasks for the .net bindings output two files needed to generate the docs: the .dll (name assigned to .out), and a .xml documenation file
2011-03-22T06:48:21  <jimevans> don't have a way to get the .xml file name yet, because there's no property to assign it to on the task object.

2011-03-22T06:52:35  *** m1k3y has joined #selenium
2011-03-22T06:56:11  <jarib> jimevans: i can help you hack it, but you probably need simon to find the proper solution
2011-03-22T06:56:34  <jimevans> yeah, i'll wait for him to get back from his meeting.
2011-03-22T06:57:16  <jimevans> any reason i'd be getting "undefined method `absolute_path' for File:Class"?
2011-03-22T06:58:09  <jimevans> crap. just realized i'm running 1.8.7.
2011-03-22T06:58:24  <jimevans> that's probably it, yeah?
2011-03-22T06:58:35  <jarib> yeah, looks like jruby doesn't have it
2011-03-22T06:58:46  <jarib> or something
2011-03-22T06:59:08  <jimevans> just running it from irb fails too.
2011-03-22T06:59:12  <jarib> ah, it's new in ruby 1.9
2011-03-22T06:59:27  <jimevans> yeah, thought so.
2011-03-22T06:59:46  <jarib> we could run jruby with the --1.9 flag, but not sure how stable that is
2011-03-22T07:00:09  <jarib> File.expand_path probably does what you need
2011-03-22T07:00:27  <jimevans> i'll try that, thanks.
2011-03-22T07:01:00  <jarib> uhm
2011-03-22T07:01:18  <jarib> perhaps i'm wrong
2011-03-22T07:01:26  <jimevans> i forsee a potential albacore issue. Derick is talking about dropping support for anything below 1.9.2 with the next release.
2011-03-22T07:01:54  *** m1k3y has quit IRC
2011-03-22T07:01:57  <jarib> perhaps the equiv. would be File.expand_path("../#{arg}", __FILE__)
2011-03-22T07:02:07  <jarib> hmm, ok
2011-03-22T07:02:39  <jimevans> oops. I misread the email. he's talking about dropping 1.8.6 and 1.9.1. that's easier to swallow.
2011-03-22T07:02:47  <jarib> indeed
2011-03-22T07:03:01  <jarib> that means jruby should be fine
2011-03-22T07:03:06  *** ner0x has joined #selenium
2011-03-22T07:05:10  <jarib> latest jruby should be 1.8.7p330 compatible
2011-03-22T07:05:57  <ato> JRuby also has a 1.9.x compatibility mode.
2011-03-22T07:06:33  <ato> That's on 1.9.2 now, I believe.
2011-03-22T07:06:44  <RossPatterson> Wow.  The first "is it on Maven yet" took almost 3 hours to show up.  Loved the followup, simonstewart :-)
2011-03-22T07:07:10  <ato> Oh, jarib already said.
2011-03-22T07:07:15  * ato didn't read the backlog.
2011-03-22T07:07:21  * RossPatterson always wants to answer "Did you try searching for it yet?" to just about any question like that.
2011-03-22T07:09:08  <jimevans> and that's why i don't want to create a nuget package for the .net bindings.
2011-03-22T07:13:49  <XCulver> why is that?
2011-03-22T07:14:00  <XCulver> ah
2011-03-22T07:14:04  <XCulver> complaining that the nuget isn't up
2011-03-22T07:14:04  <XCulver> hah
2011-03-22T07:14:28  <XCulver> speaking of complaining, the channel topic is still beta 2
2011-03-22T07:15:14  <jimevans> XCulver: it's inevitable. no matter how much we try to set expectations that "it's not in the repository yet", somebody who uses java will ask "is it in maven?"
2011-03-22T07:15:44  <XCulver> of course
2011-03-22T07:15:58  <jimevans> also, the channel topic was stuck at 2.0a1 for months, so i'm not surprised.
2011-03-22T07:16:00  <jimevans> :)

2011-03-22T07:29:18  <ato> I have a very stupid question: How can I run a JUnit test using Firefox from Eclipse by having selenium source in the build path, and not the JAR?
2011-03-22T07:29:53  <ato> It's complaining about a missing Firefox extension.
2011-03-22T07:30:05  <simonstewart> It gets tricky
2011-03-22T07:30:13  <simonstewart> Take a look at our TestFirefoxDriver to see how we do it
2011-03-22T07:30:28  <simonstewart> Basically, you'll need to add the webdriver.xpi to the base of your CLASSPATH

2011-03-22T09:42:29  <jimevans> simonstewart: what's the best way in crazy-fun to move the output of a task to a different directory?
2011-03-22T09:42:46  <simonstewart> You'll need a new task for that
2011-03-22T09:42:55  <simonstewart> I tend to break out into Rake
2011-03-22T09:43:34  <jimevans> ok. i'll investigate further.
2011-03-22T09:43:56  <jimevans> the .net documentation process produces two artifacts, a website version and a .chm version.
2011-03-22T09:44:14  <jimevans> unfortunately, it drops the .chm into the same directory as the root of the website.
2011-03-22T09:44:20  <simonstewart> Furrfu

2011-03-22T17:18:07  <donaddon> hey all.  i have a selenium user dying to know how to access / automate
2011-03-22T17:18:13  <donaddon> Firefox XUL
2011-03-22T17:18:23  <donaddon> so they can test our extension in addition to our web site
2011-03-22T17:20:16  <donaddon> (Firefox extension, obviously)
2011-03-22T17:20:56  <donaddon> Surely this has been asked, but I couldn't find it.  I see there is an executeScript function exported from the FirefoxDriver.js in the selenium source, but it appears to only execute script in a content window sandbox.

2011-03-22T17:40:38  <donaddon> ivog: thanks for the suggestion.  interesting tool.  Still, I see vague references people accessing XUL properties, which is tantamount to executing XUL -- i'm thinking this must be possible.
