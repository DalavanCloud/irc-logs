2011-06-23T01:40:23  <dregin> selenium.browserbot.getUserWindow() doesn't seem to be "getting" the current window for me in FF 3.6.

2011-06-23T01:41:04  <dregin> but when I do $j.active in firebug, it returns 0 without issue :\

2011-06-23T06:43:30  <rpk> not sure if anyone had time to look at Binken's issue, but I reproduced it last night as well.  The sample case works correctly in IE, but not in Chrome (tested with Java, as opposed to his C# sample)

2011-06-23T07:11:27  <rpk> freynaud: why does grid report that all browsers are available if they're not?
2011-06-23T07:14:53  <freynaud> rpk: i'm afraid there is a bug
2011-06-23T07:15:18  <rpk> ah ok.  I was very surprised when my linux vm reported that it was alive and ready to run tests on chrome and IE
2011-06-23T07:15:20  <freynaud> i was checking a non existing url to have the status, and this very url has been created in RC3*
2011-06-23T07:15:31  <freynaud> I'll fix it asap
2011-06-23T07:16:01  <rpk> i was checking a non existing url to have the status, and this very url has been created in RC3*  => is communication between hub and nodes broken at the moment?
2011-06-23T07:17:15  <freynaud> yes. It was pinging a random URL /wd/hub/status to get the status of a node. That retruned a 500 I think in RC2. /status has been created  so ...
2011-06-23T07:17:15  *** jimevans has joined #selenium
2011-06-23T07:17:45  <rpk> ah ok, I was beating my coworker up about how he must have configured the linux vm wrong.  oops :)
2011-06-23T07:18:26  <freynaud> I think it's just a matter of changing WebRemoteProxy.java , isAlive to return code == 200
2011-06-23T07:18:48  <rpk> cool :)
2011-06-23T07:18:48  <freynaud> but I need to write a unit test first to avoid future problem, andI can't do that from work
2011-06-23T07:19:18  <rpk> Oh, I see.  Is there an rfe for detecting browsers on the machine?
2011-06-23T07:20:12  <rpk> (I mean, if I don't specify the locations, it has to be looking somewhere by default for the executables, otherwise my test is going to fail anyways, so if we don't find anything in the default locations maybe we can not report those browsers as available?)
2011-06-23T07:20:33  <freynaud> there is no detection
2011-06-23T07:20:47  <freynaud> it assume everything is installed
2011-06-23T07:20:56  <rpk> yeah, I noticed
2011-06-23T07:21:04  *** |izzie has joined #selenium
2011-06-23T07:21:36  <freynaud> in a complex environemnt, my assumption is that nobody use the default launcher
2011-06-23T07:21:41  <rpk> also #1908 needs to be looked at or reprioritized, this prevents any tests using drop downs from passing on chrome as far as I can tell.
2011-06-23T07:21:41  <selbot2>  open/new ChromeDriver fails to select in Dropdown list - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1908
2011-06-23T07:21:46  <rpk> freynaud: ah ok
2011-06-23T07:21:48  *** Ivog has joined #selenium
2011-06-23T07:21:54  <freynaud> but generate the request manually to match the envt
2011-06-23T07:22:07  <rpk> especially since setSelected was deprecated
2011-06-23T07:22:34  <rpk> freynaud: yeah thats reasonable
2011-06-23T07:22:45  <freynaud> if you look at WebDriverDefaultNode.json , you have what's registered
2011-06-23T07:22:53  <jarib> rpk: yeah, chromium needs to pull in updated atoms from our code base and do a release
2011-06-23T07:22:55  <freynaud> I expect people to generate their own
2011-06-23T07:23:09  <freynaud> when you register, you can user -role webdriver -file xxx.json
2011-06-23T07:23:19  <rpk> freynaud: yep
2011-06-23T07:23:26  <rpk> jarib: ah ok, thanks
2011-06-23T07:24:56  <jarib> there's also the problem that the current chromedriver doesn't work with chrome 14 (i.e. current dev channel)
2011-06-23T07:25:38  <rpk> jarib: standard :P

2011-06-23T07:32:22  <jarib> rpk: standard?

2011-06-23T07:34:08  <rpk> sorry, people say it at the office, when something is broken that should work, or we go look at some component and everything is broken
2011-06-23T07:34:44  <jarib> aye :)
2011-06-23T07:35:24  <AutomatedTester> thats interesting, Simon had a moan about Firefox and webdriver should just work with future versions
2011-06-23T07:35:33  <AutomatedTester> and now Chrome 14 is broken...
2011-06-23T07:36:06  <jarib> yeah
2011-06-23T07:36:13  <jarib> not sure exactly why
2011-06-23T07:36:20  <jarib> but things like getText() fails
2011-06-23T07:36:22  <rpk> lols.  unfortunately he's not here for this moment
2011-06-23T07:36:25  <jarib> not sure he knows

2011-06-23T07:37:19  <jarib> also, .setSelected is broken with chromedriver for RC3
2011-06-23T07:37:22  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: your site went down this moring
2011-06-23T07:37:29  <jarib> because of changes on ours side
2011-06-23T07:37:33  <jarib> *our
2011-06-23T07:37:52  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: around 4 hrs ago but it came back up
2011-06-23T07:38:06  <rpk> jarib: I thought the ultimate decision was that click would replace setSelected?
2011-06-23T07:38:12  <jarib> it is
2011-06-23T07:38:36  <jarib> then i pointed out that would make it impossible to select multiple options in a <select multiple> on platforms without native events
2011-06-23T07:38:46  <rpk> yeah, I remember that
2011-06-23T07:38:51  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: ya. sometimes does that. could move it, but...
2011-06-23T07:38:52  <jarib> so simon changed click() in the atoms code to actually do control-click for options
2011-06-23T07:39:04  <jarib> which is stupid IMO
2011-06-23T07:39:26  <rpk> hmmm.  time to start building out an external library of support functions
2011-06-23T07:39:43  <rpk> and just implement setSelected as holding down the ctrl key ...
2011-06-23T07:40:06  <jarib> and now the chromedriver has outdated atoms for this case..
2011-06-23T07:40:09  <rpk> Fortunate that there was no press release for rc3... :)
2011-06-23T07:40:36  <jarib> oh, i'm sure one will come without any of these issues dealt with :P

2011-06-23T07:46:08  <adamgoucher> ironically, if he broke the limit in that thread he would be stackoverflow'ed
2011-06-23T07:46:09  <jarib> AutomatedTester: hmm, you should let adam know about this :)

2011-06-23T13:34:42  <autojack> how can I select an item out of a dropdown menu?
2011-06-23T13:35:00  <AutomatedTester> Keys.DOWN?
2011-06-23T13:35:03  <autojack> I can find the element and click it, but I'm not sure how to select something
2011-06-23T13:35:18  <AutomatedTester> or do that
2011-06-23T13:37:20  <autojack> but how would I set the value?
2011-06-23T13:38:56  *** nirvdrum has joined #selenium
2011-06-23T13:39:00  <autojack> I guess my concern is that just hitting Keys.DOWN a bunch of times assumes that the dropdown always has the same order of elements.
2011-06-23T13:39:09  <autojack> I'd rather be able to specify an element in it to click.

2011-06-23T13:42:45  <tunabum> autojack: is it a <select> with <option> ? can you use the Select interface to choose the option you want, or do you need to click on the option for some reason?
2011-06-23T13:43:37  <autojack> yeah that's what it is. let me look at the Select interface.
2011-06-23T13:44:13  <autojack> hm
2011-06-23T13:44:17  <tunabum> (new Select(selectElement)).selectBy*   (there's 3 options)
2011-06-23T13:44:30  <autojack> hmmm
2011-06-23T13:44:34  <autojack> I'm using the Ruby bindings.
2011-06-23T13:44:36  <tunabum> oh
2011-06-23T13:44:38  <tunabum> sry
2011-06-23T13:44:39  <autojack> not sure how much of this is implemented there.

2011-06-23T13:48:31  <autojack> I would have expected it to be a method of the Element class, not the Driver class.
2011-06-23T13:48:34  <autojack> that's where I was confused.

2011-06-23T13:57:36  <nirvdrum> davehunt: Did you end up trying the RC2 JAR in your grid 1 setup?
2011-06-23T13:57:56  <davehunt> no, I used b3
2011-06-23T13:58:05  <davehunt> I didn't realise I could use RC2
2011-06-23T13:58:32  <davehunt> I thought since the Grid2 stuff landed the previous launcher was unavailable
2011-06-23T13:58:47  <davehunt> Also, RC3 has a NPE that's now fixed
2011-06-23T14:00:57  <autojack> next question: I have a search form that doesn't have a submit button - normally you can hit enter to submit the search.
2011-06-23T14:01:19  <autojack> I'm trying to do a send_keys('text', :enter) on it
2011-06-23T14:01:25  <autojack> the text appears, but it doesn't submit.
2011-06-23T14:01:32  <autojack> thoughts?
2011-06-23T14:01:38  <nirvdrum> davehunt: Yeah.  I mentioned you should try replacing the selenium-server-1.0.3-standalone.jar file in the vendor/ directory.
2011-06-23T14:01:46  <nirvdrum> You must have done that to run grid 1 with 2.0 b3.
2011-06-23T14:02:03  <davehunt> yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing
2011-06-23T14:02:15  <davehunt> I doubt it's really going to help the investigation here tho
2011-06-23T14:02:22  <nirvdrum> So you are running with the 2.0rc2 JAR?
2011-06-23T14:02:31  <nirvdrum> Your results were posted with the 2.0b3 JAR.
2011-06-23T14:02:34  <davehunt> All the details are on the issue
2011-06-23T14:02:55  <nirvdrum> Okay, then any conclusions are ambiguous at best.
2011-06-23T14:03:09  <freynaud_> davehunt: hello
2011-06-23T14:03:10  <autojack> looks like .submit on the form works so I guess we can use that.
2011-06-23T14:03:16  <nirvdrum> If it's possible, I really need results from running grid 1 with the 2.0rc2 JAR for the nodes.

2011-06-23T14:05:11  <davehunt> nope
2011-06-23T14:05:12  <freynaud_> do you have the tests you're running ? i tried screenshot, get title and type in a 10 000 loop. My knees are now warm because the laptop overheated, but i couldn'(t reproduce
2011-06-23T14:05:34  <davehunt> I was using isElementPresent and isVisible in a loop

2011-06-23T14:05:46  <nirvdrum> Awesome.  Thanks for the info.

2011-06-23T14:08:31  <davehunt> I can share the page and the test, although I'd have to modify the test so it runs independent from our framework

2011-06-23T14:51:38  <autojack> it will just flip the setting.
2011-06-23T14:51:47  <autojack> I was guessing that check() would only check if unchecked.

2011-06-23T15:28:14  <Rakko> Then I went to the Google Code page and it says for users of Selenium to go to seleniumhq

2011-06-23T16:00:28  <ivog> there probably a resource limit
2011-06-23T16:00:58  <ivog> but u can use mulitple grids
2011-06-23T16:01:12  <ivog> and make your testsuite use multiple grids
2011-06-23T16:01:44  <ivog> the bottleneck is probably the testrunner

2011-06-23T16:40:43  <nirvdrum> What's up?
2011-06-23T16:40:53  <davehunt> Is there a way to set the timeout for a Grid 1.x node in a Grid 2.x hub?
2011-06-23T16:41:34  <davehunt> I know Grid 2.x nodes can set a timeout
2011-06-23T16:41:50  <nirvdrum> Yes.  The Grid 2 hub can load the Grid 1 YAML configuration file.  Otherwise I'm pretty sure a node can set a timeout value when it registers itself.
2011-06-23T16:42:01  <nirvdrum> Sorry, ignore that last part.
2011-06-23T16:42:16  <nirvdrum> Grid 1 nodes relied on the Grid 1 hub configuration.  Grid 2 hub can load that configuration file.
2011-06-23T16:42:31  <nirvdrum> So it's backwards-compatible.
2011-06-23T16:42:42  <davehunt> ooh, that sounds promising
2011-06-23T16:42:50  * davehunt checks the grid1 docs
2011-06-23T16:43:06  <nirvdrum> I don't think it's in the docs yet.  But I had emailed the dev list at one point.
2011-06-23T16:43:14  <nirvdrum> I still need to get around to making my docs contributions.
2011-06-23T16:43:30  <nirvdrum> Like the Grid 1 hub, the configuration file must be on the classpath.
2011-06-23T16:43:49  <davehunt> yeah, we have that being read in, but I suspect we're missing the particular pref
2011-06-23T16:43:57  <nirvdrum> So this likely means you need to invoke the GridLauncher class directly rather than using the "java -jar" method.
2011-06-23T16:44:02  <davehunt> I know that stuff is documented to some extent on the grid homepage
2011-06-23T16:44:30  <davehunt> sounds like it might be sessionMaxIdleTimeInSeconds
2011-06-23T16:44:42  <nirvdrum> Francois just committed something the other day that will read the file off the filesystem if you start up with "-file <path-to-file>".  But you'd have to build from trunk to get that.
2011-06-23T16:45:02  <nirvdrum> Yeah.  There's two values: a polling interval and a session idle one.
2011-06-23T16:45:24  <davehunt> I believe the file stuff was for browser configuration, but I may be wrong
2011-06-23T16:45:24  <nirvdrum> Alas, I'm not sure if that went into RC2 or RC3.  It's definitely in RC3 though.
2011-06-23T16:45:33  <davehunt> RC3 has the evil NPE :P
2011-06-23T16:45:41  <nirvdrum> Which one is that?

2011-06-23T16:55:47  <davehunt> nirvdrum: this is just a guess, but does Grid2 wait for a response for all requests, and perhaps RC doesn't send one for setTimeout..?
2011-06-23T16:56:14  <nirvdrum> RC forwards the response on setTimeout.  Otherwise none of my tests would work.
2011-06-23T16:56:19  <davehunt> ok
2011-06-23T16:56:50  <nirvdrum> ivog: Have any ideas on what may be wrong?
2011-06-23T16:57:35  <ivog> well francois looked into it, but i guess a bit further digging is needed

2011-06-23T16:58:28  <ivog> i'm gonna meet him tomorrow because he's in amsterdam so i'll talk to him about it
2011-06-23T16:58:29  <nirvdrum> Looks like his solution was to poll the machine periodically and see if it's still alive.
2011-06-23T16:59:35  <nirvdrum> But if the core of that hasn't changed in a long time, AFAICT.  So I'm not sure why it's a problem post RC3 but wasn't going back at least to the last beta.
2011-06-23T17:00:57  <ivog> well
2011-06-23T17:01:21  <ivog> francois told me it had something to do with /status being added
2011-06-23T17:01:38  <ivog> somewhere after rc2
2011-06-23T17:01:54  <nirvdrum> Hmm . . .
2011-06-23T17:01:58  <nirvdrum> I'd have to check into it more.
2011-06-23T17:02:14  <nirvdrum> Alas, that sounds like a WD-specific issue then as well :-/
2011-06-23T17:02:46  <ivog> yea so i guess its best if francois looks further into it
2011-06-23T17:03:24  <nirvdrum> I'm hoping to start messing around with the webdriver stuff more.  But the unfortunate truth is all of my tests are written using the se 1.x API at the moment.
2011-06-23T17:03:59  <ivog> ah ok
2011-06-23T17:04:13  <ivog> no easy WebdriverBackedSelenium way out for u? :)
2011-06-23T17:06:04  <nirvdrum> I'm trying to minimize the amount of undue scarring :-)
2011-06-23T17:06:18  <nirvdrum> Grid 2 should give me a natural way to start cutting over to webdriver.
2011-06-23T17:06:34  <nirvdrum> But for now it's pretty good I'm still on RC because Francois doesn't use that.
2011-06-23T17:07:03  <adamgoucher> what? you mean there isnt a nice way to switch from remote control to webdriver? say it aint so!

2011-06-23T17:12:08  <nirvdrum> Too early to tell.  Originally it wasn't looking good, but when they went in for the surgery things looked better than the MRI had originally indicated.  And I had started healing a bit and I don't think they were expecting some of that.

2011-06-23T17:56:06  <davehunt> thanks btw :)
2011-06-23T17:56:42  <nirvdrum> davehunt: Unfortunately RC3 really is a meaningless moniker for grid.  The release was pushed out solely for FF5, I believe, catching trunk in whatever state it was in for everything else.
2011-06-23T17:56:45  <rpk> AutomatedTester: i said that, didn't I?
2011-06-23T17:57:06  <davehunt> nirvdrum: It *looks* like the browser is taking too long to launch and the session is being abandoned, however the timeout should now be 5mins (using rc3)
2011-06-23T17:57:21  <AutomatedTester> i only saw the 2nd note from you going setSelected doesnt work
2011-06-23T17:57:45  <rpk> AutomatedTester: oh ok, I wasn't sure if I typed the wrong thing, pretty tired
2011-06-23T17:57:58  <nirvdrum> davehunt: Funny.  I have the exact opposite problem.  Sessions aren't being terminated when they get orphaned.  I'm actually right in the middle of adding that functionality to grid 2 :-P

2011-06-23T17:58:35  <davehunt> nirvdrum: do you see any being prematurely orphaned?
2011-06-23T17:58:53  <nirvdrum> Yes, but only because my client disconnects.
2011-06-23T17:59:17  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-06-23T17:59:33  <nirvdrum> davehunt:  You might be seeing the newSessionMaxIdleTimeout value.  That one's different (and I think you just set it to avoid the NPE).  That's more of a QoS setting.
2011-06-23T17:59:58  <nirvdrum> Basically if the new session request isn't serviced within that time interval, the request will be removed from the queue.

2011-06-23T18:00:23  <davehunt> hmm, maybe
2011-06-23T18:00:37  <davehunt> nirvdrum: would 0 be infinite in that case?
2011-06-23T18:00:47  <nirvdrum> Almost certainly not.
2011-06-23T18:01:04  <davehunt> okay
2011-06-23T18:01:13  <nirvdrum> The lack of a value was supposed to be infinite, but that gives you the NPE :-/
2011-06-23T18:01:22  <davehunt> I would like settings to be echoed out in the terminal or web console :)

2011-06-23T18:13:35  <nirvdrum> davehunt: FYI, post-RC 3 has some pretty major issues fixed that could cause test sessions to remain unutilized under load.
2011-06-23T18:14:12  <davehunt> nirvdrum: I think I'll roll back to 1.x :/
2011-06-23T18:14:20  *** brettporter has quit IRC
2011-06-23T18:15:24  <nirvdrum> Fair enough.  On the whole, the grid 2 hub seems to handle a much higher load easier than the grid 1 hub did.  But there's a situation in which the assignment thread could die and stop assigning requests to test slots.
2011-06-23T18:15:57  <nirvdrum> AFAIK, I'm the only person to actually hit because of the weird sequence of events required.  But I'd imagine anyone running in similar load would hit it eventually.
2011-06-23T18:18:03  <nirvdrum> But, yeah, if you can't run trunk, rolling back to 1.x is probably the safest/smartest thing to do.
2011-06-23T18:18:07  <davehunt> nirvdrum: the performance issue is a real pain for us too, would like to go straight to 2.x nodes and hub
2011-06-23T18:19:00  <nirvdrum> Another thing you'll be interested in is Francois and I are making a JSON query API available for the grid stuff.  You can already do this now by providing your own servlet, but we're just going to add one by default.
2011-06-23T18:19:38  <rpk> nirvdrum: autodetect some browsers are workers maybe?
2011-06-23T18:19:39  <rpk> :P
2011-06-23T18:19:49  <nirvdrum> rpk: Eh?
2011-06-23T18:20:26  <rpk> workers by default indicate that they have 5 ff, 1 IE, and 5 chrome available to run tests on
2011-06-23T18:21:06  <nirvdrum> Oh, you wrote something to me in black text.
2011-06-23T18:21:07  <rpk> since you seem able to run tests without providing the path configurations when things are in the correct install path, perhaps try and check for availability of browsers and send that informaation
2011-06-23T18:21:09  <nirvdrum> I have a black background.
2011-06-23T18:21:26  <rpk> oh, really?
2011-06-23T18:21:28  <nirvdrum> Yeah.
2011-06-23T18:21:44  <nirvdrum> Might want to drop your colors.
2011-06-23T18:21:44  <rpk> ah.  is this any better?
2011-06-23T18:21:52  <nirvdrum> Nope.
2011-06-23T18:21:55  <rpk> colors should be dropped
2011-06-23T18:21:56  <rpk> hmmm
2011-06-23T18:22:11  <nirvdrum> Anyway, that's an outstanding issue.
2011-06-23T18:22:26  <rpk> yeah, its awkward to spin up a linux worker and see IE listed as available
2011-06-23T18:22:41  <nirvdrum> But it's a bit trickier than that since people using grid usually want to delineate between different versions of browsers, which is something Selenium just doesn't do.
2011-06-23T18:22:57  <nirvdrum> rpk: You can override that though, no?
2011-06-23T18:23:13  <rpk> yeah, I know, freynaud said the same thing earlier, that the common use case is people providing the json string
2011-06-23T18:23:28  <rpk> which I agree with, but it wouldn't hurt to try and do some basic detection, no?
2011-06-23T18:23:35  <nirvdrum> I'm actually still using the grid 1 nodes.  I need to convert those over.
2011-06-23T18:23:47  <nirvdrum> But in order to do so I want to provide a similar ant launcher like grid 1 had.
2011-06-23T18:23:54  <nirvdrum> That's a fair bit more work.
2011-06-23T18:23:58  <nirvdrum> And I'm but a single man.

2011-06-23T18:28:59  <nirvdrum> It's simultaneously exhilarating and frustrating working on grid right now.  We're a fair bit behind the rest of the project on the 2.0 track.
2011-06-23T18:29:09  <nirvdrum> But we're making pretty steady progress.

2011-06-23T18:39:18  <davehunt> nirvdrum: not seen that issue afaik
2011-06-23T18:39:30  <nirvdrum> Okay.  Thanks.
