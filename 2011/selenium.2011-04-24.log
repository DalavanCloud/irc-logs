2011-04-24T06:46:02  <mattp_> hey guys, if im working on a languages new bindings, should the remote driver command specification match the camelCasing (ie rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/remote/commands.rb)?
2011-04-24T06:46:31  <mattp_> or is it my choice to go for a different naming scheme if its more idiomatic to the language

2011-04-24T08:09:10  <mattp_> jarib: cool. ok
2011-04-24T08:09:39  <jarib> mattp_: what language are you doing?
2011-04-24T08:17:31  <mattp_> jarib: perl
2011-04-24T08:17:48  <mattp_> i've already seen the partial remote driver implementation on github
2011-04-24T08:18:35  <jarib> right, we've talked before i think
2011-04-24T08:18:54  <mattp_> yep :)

2011-04-24T09:38:03  <ato> mattp_: Underscoring would be more natural for Perl.
2011-04-24T09:38:19  <ato> mattp_: I think the Python bindings use underscoring?

2011-04-24T15:06:31  *** rocky has joined #selenium
2011-04-24T15:07:06  <rocky> is there anyway to tell selenium if it is viewing a page with certain text it in (ie "AN ERROR OCCURRED") then it should fail/abort the running test ?
2011-04-24T15:07:19  <eghm> yup
2011-04-24T15:08:26  <eghm> i use istextpresent and throw an exception if I recall corretly
2011-04-24T15:09:30  <rocky> eghm: well that means i have to do the test myself... but since this check should be performed on every page load no matter what test is happening, isn't it possible to insert some sort of global checker?
2011-04-24T15:11:07  <eghm> idk about any 2.0 stuff, in 1.0 you have to build your own global
2011-04-24T15:13:04  <rocky> i'm using 1.0 stuff because i'm using selenium ide which does not output python-style webdriver (selenium 2.0) tests
2011-04-24T15:16:13  <rocky> eghm: so any info you could give me on "build your own global" would be great
2011-04-24T15:19:19  <eghm> mine refactored out, but as I don't have a ton of page loads, it probably isn't as global as you want.  patch the source maybe?
2011-04-24T15:20:07  <rocky> it seems silly to have ot do something like that... granted i don't have much experience with selenium at this point but isn't there something that tells selenium upon page load that if an HTTP Error of 500 is coming back then it's obviously an error?
2011-04-24T15:20:11  <rocky> eghm: ^^
2011-04-24T15:24:13  <eghm> not that i know of yet, the way I write my tests, it isn't that silly to not yet have that sort of functionality.  it is an FOSS project, sooner or later something like that will probably be added, another option might be aspects

2011-04-24T16:49:24  <arex\> I want to use Selenium to verify the contents of mysite.com/textfile.txt. This proves difficult, because Selenium's getText(), getBodyText() and getHtmlSource() all mess with the contents. (Inserting new lines, inserting <html><body> tags, etc)
2011-04-24T16:50:05  <arex\> Ideas?
