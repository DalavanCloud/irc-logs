2011-07-21T00:18:49  <papegaaij> hi all, we are trying to setup a simple selenium webdriver node and want a session to timeout after a few minutes, is this possible?
2011-07-21T00:19:37  <papegaaij> so we simply start the jar with no role (no separate hub and webdriver)
2011-07-21T00:19:53  <jenkinsxxx> papegaaij: elenium.waitForPageToLoad(TIMEOUT_TIME); ?
2011-07-21T00:19:59  <papegaaij> we tried -nodeTimeout 60
2011-07-21T00:20:05  <papegaaij> jenkinsxxx: no, in case the client crashes
2011-07-21T00:20:28  <jenkinsxxx> papegaaij: sorry :) tried to help
2011-07-21T00:20:44  <papegaaij> no problem :)

2011-07-21T01:33:31  <ksinkar> Hello people, I created some selenium scripts in normal html format and then exported them to the rspec format. Unfortunately the exporting is not very good. It does not exactly imitate the html test case. Actually it leaves out a lot of things like entering data into text boxes. All I get is lot of rspec code skeleton with crap filled inside it.
2011-07-21T01:36:49  <AutomatedTester> ksinkar: we try our best at exporting but unfortunately it doesnt always do what we want
2011-07-21T01:37:28  <ksinkar> AutomatedTester: if I were to record my tests in ruby, will it record correctly?
2011-07-21T01:37:41  <AutomatedTester> i dont think so

2011-07-21T01:38:58  <AutomatedTester> ksinkar: I *personally* would prefer people to use the IDE to record a skeleton of the test and then fix, make more robust, as they went through it
2011-07-21T01:39:07  <AutomatedTester> the record replay is ok, not great

2011-07-21T03:07:58  <davehunt> eranm: looks like it's been patched for Chrome already
2011-07-21T03:09:45  <davehunt> freynaud_: I'm going to try this build of grid with the extra logging now
2011-07-21T03:09:54  <davehunt> this log file is going to be *huge*
2011-07-21T03:10:13  <freynaud_> yes :)
2011-07-21T03:10:42  <freynaud_> what you can do
2011-07-21T03:10:54  <freynaud_> is Registry.java , line 84
2011-07-21T03:11:00  <eranm> davehunt, it's using the same solution as the patch to the issue proposes - get the client rects and use the 1st one.
2011-07-21T03:11:07  <freynaud_> change the default lvl to info at least
2011-07-21T03:11:44  <davehunt> eranm: seems reasonable
2011-07-21T03:11:54  <davehunt> freynaud_: hmm.. good point
2011-07-21T03:12:30  <eranm> davehunt, unless there's some code that relies on click happening in the middle of the bounding rect
2011-07-21T03:13:35  <davehunt> freynaud_: that would not log your new stuff as that's set to fine

2011-07-21T03:27:11  <simonstewart> Greetings one and all
2011-07-21T03:28:02  <ArmEagle_> Hi, I've just downloaded the Selenium IDE 1.1.0 (Firefox addon). Maybe I'm confused about the IDE window, but is that left-hand panel titles "Test Case" supposed to work completely yet?
2011-07-21T03:28:21  <ArmEagle_> Whenever I try to create a new test case, it seems to duplicate/mirror the existing test case
2011-07-21T03:28:26  *** ArmEagle_ is now known as ArmEagle
2011-07-21T03:28:55  <ArmEagle> I'd expect I can create multiple test cases in there and then save them all in a test suite
2011-07-21T03:29:33  <ArmEagle> http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SIDE/Getting+Started+with+Selenium+IDE  doesn't cover that part of the UI (just hides it)

2011-07-21T03:35:57  <simonstewart> greets
2011-07-21T03:36:11  <simonstewart> I see that there's some motion around firefox 6 support
2011-07-21T03:36:29  <AutomatedTester> yea, a little
2011-07-21T03:36:37  <AutomatedTester> not fast enough for me thoug
2011-07-21T03:36:45  <simonstewart> Agreed
2011-07-21T03:36:51  <simonstewart> PITA that it's back
2011-07-21T03:37:24  <AutomatedTester> but in the mean time going to look at a few bugs
2011-07-21T03:38:35  <simonstewart> I'm going to have a look at compiling syntheticMouse.js

2011-07-21T03:41:31  <pngl> I have a viewport issue and am probably missing something. What is the common solution for clicking/checking display status of elements that are outside of the viewport? The displayed? check does not work for such element, and I believe WD does not have window resizing capabilities.
2011-07-21T03:41:59  <ArmEagle> oh sigh never mind my remark. I guess I figured out where I went wrong
2011-07-21T03:42:03  <AutomatedTester> pngl: if its visible, webdriver will scroll to it
2011-07-21T03:46:07  <pngl> AutomatedTester: ah, indeed. I wasn't waiting long enough for the element to show up, and assumed webdriver could not see it because it was outside of the viewport. Thanks!

2011-07-21T04:09:51  <cgp_> What command from Selenium could store the number of DIVs on the page in storedVars?
2011-07-21T04:10:22  <cgp_> I tried "store, javascript{$('div').length}, myvar"
2011-07-21T04:10:28  <cgp_> but that doesn't work, it always returns 0
2011-07-21T04:10:30  <cgp_> none
2011-07-21T04:10:39  <AutomatedTester> cgp_: getXpathCount('//div')?
2011-07-21T04:11:08  <cgp_> AutomatedTester: Ah, that would work
2011-07-21T04:11:20  <cgp_> Hrm...
2011-07-21T04:11:33  <cgp_> What I'm actually trying to get is the number of checkboxes which are checked
2011-07-21T04:12:01  <cgp_> I simplified it down to div.. but not an entirely bad thought
2011-07-21T04:12:17  <AutomatedTester> /input[@type=checkbox and value=true
2011-07-21T04:12:21  <AutomatedTester> something like that
2011-07-21T04:12:48  <cgp_> Is there no way to store values from javascript after an eval
2011-07-21T04:12:56  <cgp_> I mean, there are all these "storeEval"
2011-07-21T04:13:10  <cgp_> functions, and I know they should be returning a value, but they don't
2011-07-21T04:15:49  <ArmEagle> ahh.. (Firefox IDE), pause time needs to be put in the first field, which is the Target box, not the Value box
2011-07-21T04:15:54  <ArmEagle> That isn't intuitive..
2011-07-21T04:21:09  *** adamgoucher has joined #selenium
2011-07-21T04:25:01  <cgp_> I just don't get it, I'm guessing I don't understand the namespace I'm in
2011-07-21T04:25:05  <cgp_> shouldn't this command: "store, javascript{$('div').length}, myvar"
2011-07-21T04:25:31  <cgp_> store in myvar the number of divs
2011-07-21T04:25:35  <davehunt> freynaud_: the log is with you
2011-07-21T04:26:52  <cgp_> it runs just fine, it just returns 0
2011-07-21T04:27:07  <cgp_> which seems, well, odd, considering there are definitely divs on the page
2011-07-21T04:27:22  <cgp_> even if I could use getXpathCount, I'm baffled as to why it doesn't work
2011-07-21T04:29:38  <AutomatedTester> cgp_: have you tried size()?

2011-07-21T05:35:43  <cgp_> Is there anyway to return values from javascript which are run in the namespace of the page using Selenium IDE?
2011-07-21T05:36:33  <eranm> cgp_, with the Selenium 2 API you can just call executeScript and it will return most values correctly (WebElements, list, the lot)
2011-07-21T05:36:51  <cgp_> Ah, but I'm using the Selenium IDE, and that's not a breakable restriction in this case
2011-07-21T05:37:10  <cgp_> In the reference, it says : "Note that, by default, the snippet will run in the context of the "selenium" object itself, so this will refer to the Selenium object. Use window to refer to the window of your application, e.g. window.document.getElementById('foo')"
2011-07-21T05:37:43  <eranm> ato, yt?
2011-07-21T05:37:49  <cgp_> which is all well and good, but for some reason, I can't access my globals either, like jQuery or prototype
2011-07-21T05:38:50  <simonstewart> The selenium object isn't in your page
2011-07-21T05:38:58  <simonstewart> So you can't access the globals
2011-07-21T05:39:10  *** MikeSmith has joined #selenium

2011-07-21T05:40:06  *** curseg has left #selenium
2011-07-21T05:40:32  <cgp_> First restriction is that I've got to write this from within Selenium IDE
2011-07-21T05:40:37  *** ssims has joined #selenium
2011-07-21T05:40:50  <cgp_> I think getCurrentWindow() may do the trick, because it's returning the namespace I am looking for
2011-07-21T05:40:59  <cgp_> however, to get the point straight
2011-07-21T05:41:14  <cgp_> I was basically trying to access Prototype, which is part of my page
2011-07-21T05:41:22  <cgp_> and store the result using storeEval
2011-07-21T05:42:01  <cgp_> I started with things like "storeeval, $$('input[checked]).length, test"
2011-07-21T05:42:09  *** cgoldberg has joined #selenium
2011-07-21T05:42:49  <cgp_> but it kept saying things like such and such is not a function
2011-07-21T05:43:06  <ArmEagle> hmm, the more i read about Selenium/WebDriver, the more confused I get. I guess I should just start to actually try and use Selenium Server
2011-07-21T05:43:15  <cgp_> because $ I think refers to some selenium-ide defined function (in the namespace that the function is used)
2011-07-21T05:43:41  <ArmEagle> Of course I then run into Selenium 2/WebDriver not working with PHPUnit yet
2011-07-21T05:43:42  <Samit> cgp_: Why do you want to store it?
2011-07-21T05:44:10  *** andialbrecht is now known as andialbrecht_
2011-07-21T05:44:10  <cgp_> Well, the long story is that I'm trying to see what selenium sees at a particular point
2011-07-21T05:44:47  <cgp_> I'm guessing that the click event hasn't finished processing by the time the next command is run
2011-07-21T05:44:59  <cerberos> I'm looking into why the webdriver api is so sparse (in python). For example if I have an element I'd like to be able to find out what _all_ its attributes are. I've found /session/:sessionId/element/:id
2011-07-21T05:45:02  <cgp_> because something that should be simple (clicking on a checkbox) is naturally tied to an ajax event
2011-07-21T05:45:14  <Samit> cgp_: that is likely
2011-07-21T05:45:20  <cgp_> right
2011-07-21T05:45:20  <cerberos> but the docs say it hasn't been implemented yet
2011-07-21T05:45:37  <cgp_> so, I need to do some type of check before I move on that it's finished
2011-07-21T05:46:11  <cgp_> and I was thinking about looking at the page to see that the checkboxes have updated
2011-07-21T05:46:21  <cgp_> I'm not sure that that will be good enough
2011-07-21T05:46:23  <cgp_> but in general
2011-07-21T05:46:48  <cgp_> I just need to be able to return data from the page into stored variables (I like to know these things I suppose)
2011-07-21T05:47:02  <cgp_> Now I see that the bridge I'm looking for is getCurrentWindow()
2011-07-21T05:48:35  <cgp_> Is there a way we could wrap the trigger of an event in a closure such that it would only return after complete?
2011-07-21T05:48:43  <cgp_> Is that insanity?
2011-07-21T05:49:18  <simonstewart> With WebDriver there's executeAsyncScript
2011-07-21T05:49:33  <simonstewart> qq: why are you tied to IDE?
2011-07-21T05:49:47  <simonstewart> It sounds like you'd be fine with a real programming language
2011-07-21T05:49:57  <cgp_> I am. I'm trying to hand this test off to QA
2011-07-21T05:50:26  <cgp_> I'm probably making it more complicated than need be
2011-07-21T05:50:32  <simonstewart> If they're not comfy with programming, it sounds like you're heading down a complex route
2011-07-21T05:50:35  <simonstewart> :)
2011-07-21T05:50:50  <simonstewart> I've had a lot of success having developers write page objects
2011-07-21T05:50:56  <simonstewart> and qa/testers write tests using those
2011-07-21T05:51:01  <Samit> cgp_: I suspect that it is indeed way too complex than it should be
2011-07-21T05:51:24  <cgp_> I'll see if I can simplify my way out of it
2011-07-21T05:51:37  <simonstewart> "get it working, then get it working nicely"
2011-07-21T05:51:50  <Samit> cgp_: so it would help if can go up one level and describe the goal of the steps you are trying to take
2011-07-21T05:52:54  <cgp_> so, we have a list of checkboxes, and I was trying to randomly select a list of those checkboxes, take the count of the checkboxes that end up being selected and make sure that count matches on another page
2011-07-21T05:53:43  <cgp_> the trick of it is, that the number of checkboxes that I click does not necessarily match the number that will end up being selected (as this is a tree, and clicking a top level checkbox can sometimes induce secondary databases to be selected)
2011-07-21T05:53:59  <simonstewart> why isn't this just staying a developer focused test?
2011-07-21T05:54:15  <simonstewart> It sounds like if it fails, the QA folks are just going to sling it back your way
2011-07-21T05:54:30  <cgp_> ah yes, that's would be true
2011-07-21T05:54:32  <simonstewart> (though I have no idea how your company works)
2011-07-21T05:54:41  <simonstewart> (so perhaps I'm wildly mistaken)
2011-07-21T05:55:13  <cgp_> Well, true that
2011-07-21T05:55:21  <simonstewart> :)
2011-07-21T05:55:48  <cgp_> Hrm... The biggest thing I like about using this as a selenium-ide script is that I can just attach the script to the bug for later reference
2011-07-21T05:56:00  <cgp_> but, then again, it doesn't get stored in source control
2011-07-21T05:56:02  <cgp_> which sucks
2011-07-21T05:56:10  <simonstewart> agreed
2011-07-21T05:56:46  <cgp_> I have a lot more thinking to do about this

2011-07-21T06:00:35  <Conanbatt> Hello. I made a test with Selenium IDE and i would like to be able to run it from the commandline, to automate it. Is that possible?  .
2011-07-21T06:00:53  <eranm> Ok, I could use some help with understanding getBoundingClientRect -  specifically, in this page http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/server/test/org/openqa/selenium/tests/html/test_click_page1.html , why the bounding client rect for the element 'linkWithEnclosedImage' does not contain the image in the tag.
2011-07-21T06:01:12  <Conanbatt> i tried something along the lines of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1144744/how-do-i-launch-the-selenium-ide-from-the-command-line-with-a-specific-test-case but i get an error when i fiddle with it

2011-07-21T06:28:26  <Conanbatt> No answer? :( no way to do it?
2011-07-21T06:28:34  <Conanbatt> i have to setup a selenium server?
2011-07-21T06:30:09  <jimevans> Conanbatt: I'm late to the party. I missed your question. (Not that I'll have an answer either)
2011-07-21T06:30:27  <eranm> Conanbatt was asking about running Selenium-IDE scripts from the command line
2011-07-21T06:30:30  <Conanbatt> I want to run some Selenium IDE tests automatically
2011-07-21T06:30:58  <eranm> And I was about to suggest the mailing list since it seems none of the IDE folks are here
2011-07-21T06:31:01  <jimevans> ah. IDE. nope, really not going to have an answer.
2011-07-21T06:31:12  <Conanbatt> I did find this in SO  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1144744/how-do-i-launch-the-selenium-ide-from-the-command-line-with-a-specific-test-case
2011-07-21T06:32:12  <Conanbatt> So only way to do so would be to setup a selenium RC server?. My situation is that i test a browser extension actually. So i cannot really externalize the tests so much
2011-07-21T06:33:39  <jimevans> Conanbatt: I honestly don't know. You're using IDE, which I (purposefully) know very very little about.
2011-07-21T06:33:55  <eranm> Conanbatt, it's entirely possible to install additional Firefox extensions if you're using the Selenium 2 API (Have a look at the FirefoxProfile class).
2011-07-21T06:35:25  <eranm> and if you use the new API you could have it running inside a java test runner of your choice, from the command line, IDE, or continuous build .
2011-07-21T06:36:03  <eranm> (I'm not saying it's not possible to do with the Selenium IDE, I'm saying I don't see any of the IDE folks here who can help with that)
2011-07-21T06:36:15  <Conanbatt> Ah there are specialists on IDE ? :)
2011-07-21T06:36:31  <jarib> Samit or adamgoucher maybe
2011-07-21T06:36:41  <Samit> Conanbatt: I am just reading through your queries
2011-07-21T06:38:29  <Samit> Conanbatt: I agree with what eranm just said. It is best to use a real programming language. Try the export features of the IDE
2011-07-21T06:39:01  <Samit> Conanbatt: They can convert to RC as well as WebDriver
2011-07-21T06:39:28  <Conanbatt> So you suggest i export the test, setup a server , install the firefox plug in with the 2.0 API and run it from there?
2011-07-21T06:40:12  <Samit> Conanbatt: If you use WebDriver then you do not need a server.
2011-07-21T06:40:49  <Conanbatt> Ok i get it now, i can do a ruby script and run it from there. It uses the computers default firefox which will have the extension installed
2011-07-21T06:41:29  <jarib> ksinkar_: Samit here did the WebDriver export stuff, if you want to show him your problem ^
2011-07-21T06:42:09  <Samit> Conanbatt: That would be my recommended approach.
2011-07-21T06:42:33  <jarib> Conanbatt: WebDriver uses an empty profile, but you can configure it to use your default profile
2011-07-21T06:42:44  <jarib> Conanbatt: check the RubyBindings page on the wiki
2011-07-21T06:42:47  <jarib> :wiki rubybindings
2011-07-21T06:42:48  <selbot2_> 1: RubyBindings: Ruby bindings - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RubyBindings

2011-07-21T06:42:48  <selbot2_> 3: ScalingWebDriver: Describes issues that have to be handled when running concurrent Se2 - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ScalingWebDriver
2011-07-21T06:42:57  <eranm> Conanbatt, it'll use a clean profile which may not have the extension installed (if it was only installed for a specific user). However, you can use the API to install an additional extension (or do what jarib suggested)
2011-07-21T06:43:09  <Conanbatt> excellent
2011-07-21T06:44:43  <Samit> Conanbatt: Just for your information, there is a way to run IDE tests using Selenium RC using a command line, See my blog for some details http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/2010/09/15/exploratory-maintenance-and-debugging-selenium-tests/
2011-07-21T06:45:07  <Samit> Conanbatt: but, I think that the WebDriver way is better.

2011-07-21T06:47:44  <jimevans> honestly, I'd rather know why the current implementation is failing, but I've never seen it fail.
2011-07-21T06:47:48  <simonstewart> Wouldn't that build up to two new DLLs?
2011-07-21T06:48:13  <jimevans> no, only one extra. the patch was sent privately to me, and i've looked at it.
2011-07-21T06:48:27  <simonstewart> What's the license on the extra DLL?
2011-07-21T06:49:00  <jimevans> same as ours, I guess. it's original code. need to get the submitter to sign the CLA.
2011-07-21T06:49:17  <jimevans> Although to be fair, most of the patch is rearranging our existing code.
2011-07-21T06:49:29  <simonstewart> CLA is good
2011-07-21T06:49:38  <simonstewart> I'd be interested to understand why ours is failing too

2011-07-21T08:06:02  <simonstewart> For a second I thought I was going blind. It's just raining outside
2011-07-21T08:07:26  <cgp_> simonstewart: Are you guys opposed to doing a snapshot build?
2011-07-21T08:07:26  <Parabola> simonstewart: stop supporting maven?
2011-07-21T08:07:41  <simonstewart> gcp_: we'll do another release on Monday
2011-07-21T08:08:23  <cgp_> simonstewart: Well, that's fine, nothing wrong with that, I'm just wondering if there isn't a continuous build server option that could be employed
2011-07-21T08:08:33  <cgp_> it would potentially prevent the whining
2011-07-21T08:08:54  <cgp_> probably not, because there will always be whining, but maybe it will stop the whining about that?
2011-07-21T08:09:11  *** tunabum has joined #selenium
2011-07-21T08:11:05  <simonstewart> The problem is that we're not pushing things into maven central immediately
2011-07-21T08:11:22  <simonstewart> The maven experts in the group tell me that it's not hard to work around this
2011-07-21T08:11:29  <simonstewart> But, apparently, maven users disagree
2011-07-21T08:12:26  <cgp_> ah, I think I get it, I'm slow
2011-07-21T08:12:33  <cgp_> so it's on your local repository, but not the central?
2011-07-21T08:12:44  <cgp_> just didn't make the push from one to the other?
2011-07-21T08:12:44  <simonstewart> It's in no repo
2011-07-21T08:12:52  <simonstewart> Right. No push into central
2011-07-21T08:13:37  <cgp_> I'm trying to think of what the workaround is
2011-07-21T08:13:39  <cgp_> (I use Maven)
2011-07-21T08:13:51  <cgp_> (I am patient though)
2011-07-21T08:14:00  <cgp_> (even though I've asked about just this sort of thing in the past)
2011-07-21T08:14:09  <simonstewart> lol
2011-07-21T08:14:14  <tunabum> cgp_: you have to install locally
2011-07-21T08:14:20  <cgp_> oh, yeah
2011-07-21T08:14:25  <cgp_> download and install locally
2011-07-21T08:14:26  <simonstewart> ^^ see, that's what I'm talking about
2011-07-21T08:14:45  <cgp_> yeah, that becomes less ideal with larger and larger number of people
2011-07-21T08:14:58  <tunabum> just cause you don't like it doesn't mean many don't simonstewart :)
2011-07-21T08:15:26  <jimevans> I saw across #2103 in the tracker this morning, and it's depressing me.
2011-07-21T08:15:26  <selbot2_>  open/new Handle the confirm window when a form is submiting - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2103
2011-07-21T08:15:31  <simonstewart> indeed, that's what I want to fix it
2011-07-21T08:15:46  <jimevans> s/saw across/saw
2011-07-21T08:16:08  <cgp_> and then you get the pedantic people who consider that a non-standard build process when using continuous integration if you're popping on the box to add things
2011-07-21T08:16:14  <simonstewart> Hmph. I bet the submit hits a JS path that blocks
2011-07-21T08:16:24  <cgp_> but at this point, we're talking about bleeding edge software, something which was just released
2011-07-21T08:16:33  <cgp_> so, do you really need it asap?
2011-07-21T08:16:36  <simonstewart> cgp_: I thought most companies that cared had internal repos?
2011-07-21T08:16:47  <jimevans> simonstewart: indeed it does. didn't even have to debug it to know that.
2011-07-21T08:16:57  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-07-21T08:16:59  <simonstewart> Bloody submit
2011-07-21T08:17:02  <Parabola> System.out.println("Order confirmation: " + conf.getCssValue("orderconfirmnumber")); <-- not working
2011-07-21T08:17:06  <Parabola> what am i doing wrong? :)
2011-07-21T08:17:18  <simonstewart> I may end up making something smart to try and figure out what should be clicked
2011-07-21T08:17:18  <Parabola> i'm trying to get the string out of that, it includes the order conf number
2011-07-21T08:17:25  <cgp_> simonstewart: yeah
2011-07-21T08:17:58  <tunabum> Parabola: I know of no css attribute called orderconfirmnumber...
2011-07-21T08:18:00  <cgp_> simonstewart: perhaps that's the correct response -- but having a server boot out the version automatically certainly does have its advantages
2011-07-21T08:18:22  <Parabola> crap
2011-07-21T08:18:25  <Parabola> copy and paste fail
2011-07-21T08:18:26  <tunabum> Parabola: getCssValue ... pass in things like height, width, display, background
2011-07-21T08:18:30  <Parabola> yeah
2011-07-21T08:18:33  <tunabum> ok :)
2011-07-21T08:18:37  <jimevans> simonstewart: if you look carefully at the example html in the bug, there's no clickable element that would cause a submit. calling the javascript submit() method is the right thing to do.
2011-07-21T08:18:47  <simonstewart> cgp_: that's why I'm hunting for a solution
2011-07-21T08:18:55  <simonstewart> Arse
2011-07-21T08:18:57  <simonstewart> That's not nice
2011-07-21T08:19:07  <simonstewart> How would a user submit it?
2011-07-21T08:19:15  <tunabum> hitting enter on the input
2011-07-21T08:19:41  *** QAguy has joined #selenium
2011-07-21T08:19:43  <jimevans> and you just *know* there are forms out there like that in the wild.
2011-07-21T08:19:44  <cgp_> simonstewart: a solution to building it automatically or a solution to installing locally
2011-07-21T08:19:47  <simonstewart> right
2011-07-21T08:19:54  <simonstewart> (to both cgp_ and jimevans)
2011-07-21T08:20:11  * davehunt just found out how simonstewart got Firefox 4 to work with modal dialogs in Selenium :)
2011-07-21T08:20:13  <simonstewart> cgp_: really, we should be able to push with the release target
2011-07-21T08:20:30  <davehunt> whilst trying to solve the same thing in a Mozmill test
2011-07-21T08:20:41  * simonstewart whistles innocently
2011-07-21T08:21:13  <cgp_> simonstewart: ignorant question: doesn't hudson do things like that?
2011-07-21T08:21:15  <davehunt> simonstewart: I'm raising a bug to solve it 'properly' in Mozmill. I'm sure you can swipe the code once it's done. ;)
2011-07-21T08:21:39  <simonstewart> davehunt: or, you know, mozilla can keep the code and swipe webdriver :)
2011-07-21T08:21:59  <simonstewart> cgp_: perhaps, but we do releases manually rather than on green builds
2011-07-21T08:22:03  <davehunt> simonstewart: of course
2011-07-21T08:22:10  <simonstewart> cf: our lack of a continuous build that we trust

2011-07-21T08:24:52  <tunabum> jimevans: same here (sf)
2011-07-21T08:25:22  <Parabola> crap
2011-07-21T08:25:27  <jarib> jimevans: take that as a hint
2011-07-21T08:25:33  <Parabola> so only 1 out of 3 runs of my test work
2011-07-21T08:25:43  <Parabola> i keep getting unable to locate element
2011-07-21T08:25:56  <Parabola> maybe some type of timer between steps?
2011-07-21T08:25:57  <jimevans> jarib: i wouldn't care but without it, compiling the atoms takes... so...... long........
2011-07-21T08:26:01  <tunabum> Parabola: timing issue? do you have an implicit or explicit wait?
2011-07-21T08:26:06  <Parabola> no waits
2011-07-21T08:26:07  <jarib> ah, yeah
2011-07-21T08:26:20  <jarib> they really should build that calcdeps thing into the compiler
2011-07-21T08:26:23  <Parabola> tunabum: whats the recommended way
2011-07-21T08:26:34  <ruel> @simonstewart, what is the big issue with maven?  isn't it just a matter of uploading the built binaries and pom to the maven repo?
2011-07-21T08:26:36  <tunabum> Parabola: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html#explicit-and-implicit-waits
2011-07-21T08:26:40  <jimevans> Parabola: see if a wait helps the problem. I'd look at the WebDriverWait class.
2011-07-21T08:26:44  <ruel> we had to do the same sort of thing at jboss, before we mavenized
2011-07-21T08:27:05  <Parabola> :) nice thanks
2011-07-21T08:27:27  <jimevans> (but honestly, I use Thread.sleep before using WebDriverWait to make sure it's a timing problem)
2011-07-21T08:27:50  <tunabum> that makes me a little sad...
2011-07-21T08:28:01  <jimevans> (but i would never ever ever use it in production code)
2011-07-21T08:28:08  <tunabum> knows that ;)
2011-07-21T08:29:41  <simonstewart> ruel: I detest maven, so the uploads are handled by someone else
2011-07-21T08:29:56  <simonstewart> Worse, the maven artifacts aren't the same as the ones that everyone else uses
2011-07-21T08:29:59  <ruel> gotcha.  no arguments there.   We hates it.
2011-07-21T08:30:29  <simonstewart> But it'd be nice to know we're not uploading garbage to maven central
2011-07-21T08:30:41  <simonstewart> Because though I hate the tool myself, I know that others use it and like it
2011-07-21T08:30:44  <jimevans> this'll give everyone a laugh. at my workplace, we're creating a new java-based web project.
2011-07-21T08:31:00  <simonstewart> in the .net shop?
2011-07-21T08:31:01  <jimevans> we build using maven. ui for the generated web pages is using extjs.
2011-07-21T08:31:09  <simonstewart> ouch
2011-07-21T08:32:04  <jimevans> we have two product lines. one .net (for small/medium sized business), one for larger businesses currently written in perl (!)
2011-07-21T08:32:33  <jimevans> (the java product is a replacement for the perl one)
2011-07-21T08:32:51  <simonstewart> nasty
2011-07-21T08:32:53  <cgp_> yeah, what once was done in 700 lines of PERL is now 50,000 lines of Java
2011-07-21T08:33:04  <simonstewart> Does anyone there have java experience?
2011-07-21T08:33:08  <cgp_> with 450mb of bytecode libraries
2011-07-21T08:33:11  <jimevans> a fair number.
2011-07-21T08:33:18  <simonstewart> Might not be too bad
2011-07-21T08:33:37  <jimevans> cgp_: the perl code is horrific.
2011-07-21T08:33:57  <tunabum> correction perl code is horrific
2011-07-21T08:34:00  <tunabum> ;)
2011-07-21T08:34:06  <jimevans> :D
2011-07-21T08:34:06  <cgp_> so, trading unreadable for unmaintainable
2011-07-21T08:34:09  *** pavelko has joined #selenium
2011-07-21T08:34:19  <simonstewart> eh? Java's pretty easy to maintain
2011-07-21T08:34:30  <jimevans> no, trading unreadable *and* unmaintainable for unmaintainable. :)
2011-07-21T08:34:42  <cgp_> jimevans: yeah, I thought that after I wrote it
2011-07-21T08:34:48  <cgp_> unreadable code is unmaintainable
2011-07-21T08:34:51  <jimevans> i'm not saying all perl code is horrific. this particular set of perl code is horrific.
2011-07-21T08:34:59  <cgp_> simonstewart: Eh, I get overwhelmed by it's verboseness
2011-07-21T08:35:17  <tunabum> jimevans: i challenge you to point to non-horrific perl code ;)
2011-07-21T08:35:19  <simonstewart> Meh. My IDE makes it easy to travel through
2011-07-21T08:35:22  <cgp_> simonstewart: IDEs help
2011-07-21T08:35:34  <tunabum> (in a large product)
2011-07-21T08:35:54  <jimevans> i'm making the transition to java from c#, which I find to be a servicable language.
2011-07-21T08:35:58  <simonstewart> tunabum: I once had a 20k perl program that we used at the radio station I worked at
2011-07-21T08:36:06  <cgp_> In the end, it always can come back to how it is written
2011-07-21T08:36:13  <simonstewart> C# has nicer features than java
2011-07-21T08:36:17  <cgp_> well written code in any language is fairly maintainable
2011-07-21T08:36:18  <jimevans> i agree.
2011-07-21T08:36:19  <simonstewart> and I'd love reified genericsa
2011-07-21T08:36:43  <jimevans> the C# generics are nice. I like the event model a lot better too.
2011-07-21T08:37:21  <simonstewart> delegates?
2011-07-21T08:37:26  *** celm has joined #selenium
2011-07-21T08:37:54  <jimevans> yeah. declaring an event in a class is pretty easy syntactically.
2011-07-21T08:37:57  <cgp_> simonstewart: which IDE? I'm pretty much forced to use Eclipse, which is SOOO slow.
2011-07-21T08:38:05  *** csanchez has joined #selenium
2011-07-21T08:38:10  <simonstewart> IDEA is my favourite
2011-07-21T08:38:12  <cgp_> On a machine it really wasn't meant to do handle large code bases
2011-07-21T08:38:15  <simonstewart> But eclipse can be okay too
2011-07-21T08:38:21  <simonstewart> Turn off the mylin rubbish
2011-07-21T08:38:22  <jimevans> oh, yeah, our preferred IDE is springsource (an eclipse variant).
2011-07-21T08:39:44  <cgp_> simonstewart: if I don't know what mylin/mylyn is, that might hurt me :)
2011-07-21T08:39:46  <jimevans> guess what I'm doing now...
2011-07-21T08:39:49  <Parabola> intelliJ rapes ram
2011-07-21T08:39:56  <simonstewart> I never understand why companies will pay salary, workstation costs, insurance and what not, yet never stretch to a paid for IDE if there's a free alternative
2011-07-21T08:40:02  <jimevans> that's right, downloading gecko!
2011-07-21T08:40:12  <simonstewart> Yay! gecko FTW
2011-07-21T08:40:39  <cgp_> simonstewart: hah -- workstation -- 2ghz dual core with 4gb on winxp, we're not exactly top of the line
2011-07-21T08:40:47  <cgp_> (naturally, winxp does not see 4gb)
2011-07-21T08:41:09  <simonstewart> It's things like that which make me find a new job

2011-07-21T09:10:56  <jimevans> protip: if you're connected to a machine via remote desktop, don't disable the network connection on the remote machine.
2011-07-21T09:12:08  <jimevans> especially if you're in new jersey, and the server you're connected to is in florida.

2011-07-21T10:22:12  <antlong> tunabum, hmn are you new to python?
2011-07-21T10:22:37  <tunabum> not really new to python... newish to using python webdriver
2011-07-21T10:23:07  <tunabum> is there another normal way you like to wait for elements?
2011-07-21T10:23:49  <tunabum> (or something in general i'm doing very wrong?)
2011-07-21T10:24:01  <antlong> tunabum https://github.com/antlong/selenium/blob/master/selenium/selenium.py
2011-07-21T10:24:33  <tunabum> that's the RC version
2011-07-21T10:24:39  <antlong> same logic
2011-07-21T10:24:46  <simonstewart> Right
2011-07-21T10:24:50  <simonstewart> Must Leave Office Now
2011-07-21T10:24:52  <tunabum> yeah, but you wouldn't use that class for WebDriver right?
2011-07-21T10:24:53  <simonstewart> G'night all
2011-07-21T10:25:00  <antlong> i wouldnt use a class
2011-07-21T10:25:02  <antlong> simonstewart see ya
2011-07-21T10:25:04  <Anil> Is there anybody to help migrating scripts written in 1.1 to 2.1?
2011-07-21T10:25:48  <antlong> all that is required is a simple method that evaluates for presence at some specified interval
2011-07-21T10:25:51  <tunabum> you're using python, everything's a class (err, object)
2011-07-21T10:25:56  *** simonstewart has left #selenium
2011-07-21T10:26:13  <antlong> tunabum a class is an object, but an object isnt necessarily a class.
2011-07-21T10:26:15  <tunabum> so you repeat that method everywhere? or import it?
2011-07-21T10:26:27  <tunabum> true
2011-07-21T10:26:58  <tunabum> methods aren't very OO :)

2011-07-21T13:23:11  <jimevans> we used to have the problem in the RC API, because we handled alerts by overriding window.alert()/.confirm(), which wouldn't get attached until after onload.

Anyone else notice this? I did see that webdriverbackedselenium isn't fully integrated with all browsers yet, so maybe that's the reason?

2011-07-21T14:21:12  <tunabum> need to rework that sentence, it's a bit ambiguous to me
2011-07-21T14:21:53  <jimevans> the dependency .dlls are signed as well. the authors of those projects signed them.
2011-07-21T14:22:07  <tunabum> ok, thx
2011-07-21T14:22:46  <jimevans> er, let me clarify. the dlls all have strong names, which is not necessarily the same thing as "digitally signed"

2011-07-21T14:25:16  <jimevans> strong names mean that they are a specific version that can be referred to that has nothing to do with "version numbers"
2011-07-21T14:25:26  <jimevans> they can also be put in the gac.
2011-07-21T14:25:37  <tunabum> ok
2011-07-21T14:26:14  <tunabum> just for clarity sake, we only sign Selenium*.dll and WebDriver*.dll

2011-07-21T14:43:22  <AutomatedTester> create a DSL that abstracts part of the work away

2011-07-21T14:44:31  <whitecat> What is a DSL?
2011-07-21T14:44:53  <whitecat> Well i would want to use a language they already know like C#
2011-07-21T14:46:48  <AutomatedTester> DSL is domain specific language
2011-07-21T14:47:10  <AutomatedTester> its how you would abstract your code
2011-07-21T14:47:23  <AutomatedTester> so it would do browser stuff but you wouldnt see Selenium
