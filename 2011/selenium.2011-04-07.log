2011-04-07T06:36:27  <RossPatterson> You mean that when you click on the list in a <SELECT> tag, the box opens up to show the <OPTION> values?

2011-04-07T08:05:04  <antlong> youd need to put the array in to arr_name, then you can reference an indice.

2011-04-07T09:08:28  <RossPatterson> bebe: I don't know how to use them in Python, but if you can get it to send them to Selenium, they work just fine.  One of our standard tests is to have a test script (in C#) type "??" and "??" in every text field of every page, and make sure they get through correctly.
2011-04-07T09:08:46  *** mbeierl has left #selenium
2011-04-07T09:09:11  <RossPatterson> Hmm ... maybe IRC doesn't understand Unicode characters - those looked good when I typed them :-)
2011-04-07T09:09:24  <RossPatterson> (OK, when I cut-and-pasted them)
2011-04-07T09:10:05  <RossPatterson> My point being: If your test-script language is Unicode-aware, everything should work.

2011-04-07T09:56:04  <new2b> Hi so I have a somewhat convoluted case. I have 72 xPath nodes. Each of them contain either dropdown, multiple choice (checkbox or radio), or textbox. I need to figure out how to figure out which one it is automatically. I am not sure how to do that
2011-04-07T09:56:38  <new2b> My initial thought is to get some algorithm going that will determine which type it is and then send it to appropriate handling
2011-04-07T09:57:19  <new2b> but I am having trouble coming up with a way of getting an if statement to figure out where to look for to determine what type of question it is
2011-04-07T09:58:46  *** erwan has quit IRC
2011-04-07T09:59:52  <new2b> the text is of this format: <div class="q"> q text <br> <select> <option value="70983">opt1</option><option value="70984">opt2 </option></select><br></div>
2011-04-07T10:00:32  *** sfbrian has joined #selenium
2011-04-07T10:01:39  <new2b> so what I need is something like if(<select> in xpath=//*div[@class="q"][count]) then qType="mc"
2011-04-07T10:01:48  <new2b> but I am baffled as to how i would accomplish this

2011-04-07T10:15:42  <elopio> new2, selenium2 has a function findElementsByTagName
2011-04-07T10:15:57  <elopio> with taht you can get a list of all the selects, for example.
2011-04-07T10:18:23  <new2b> what I need though is more of after finding all elements that have @class="q" have a selection process where I determin what type of question that node is (which IsElementPresent might work-testing it out right now)

2011-04-07T10:59:59  <sfbrian> haha
2011-04-07T11:00:23  <RossPatterson> XPath is cool, what isn't cool is that Internet Explorer STILL doesn't have a native implementation.
2011-04-07T11:00:48  <RossPatterson> Plus the fact that people use either hand-coded or machine-generated XPath selectors that are butt-ugly.
2011-04-07T11:00:49  <sfbrian> that's true... using CSS locators just means you are conforming to IE
2011-04-07T11:00:56  <RossPatterson> XPath can be a thing of beauty.
2011-04-07T11:01:01  <sfbrian> I don't want to give into IE
2011-04-07T11:01:20  <sfbrian> it took me a long time to perfect the art of xpath
2011-04-07T11:02:03  <RossPatterson> XPath is like Zen.  Lots of people think they know Zen, but few really do.

2011-04-07T11:04:20  <sfbrian> if something causes you to write an ugly xpath then there is something else wrong
2011-04-07T11:04:48  <RossPatterson> Agreed.

2011-04-07T11:10:33  <simonstewart> Hey all
2011-04-07T11:12:02  <jarib> jleyba: so, about what we discussed yesterday - i think the server being able to leave the browser running will be more realiable than any auto-shutdown thing
2011-04-07T11:12:20  <jarib> so we always shut down the chrome server on exit
2011-04-07T11:12:38  <jleyba> Hmm
2011-04-07T11:12:43  <jarib> but if people didn't call quit(), the browsers will be left around
2011-04-07T11:13:00  <jarib> even if the server is gone.

2011-04-07T11:40:23  <jarib> QAguy: seconf was fantastic
2011-04-07T11:40:36  <santiycr> alright, will check that out

2011-04-07T11:41:05  <AutomatedTester> jleyba: executing_async doesnt work in the new chromedriver?
2011-04-07T11:41:19  <jleyba> it's just not implemented yet
2011-04-07T11:41:28  <jarib> jleyba: but who's using it concurrently?
2011-04-07T11:41:28  <AutomatedTester> ok cool
2011-04-07T11:42:16  <QAguy> jarib: Will any videos of the presentation from the conference be posted anywhere do you know?

2011-04-07T11:42:27  <QAguy> Nice
2011-04-07T11:42:28  <jleyba> AutomatedTester: the driver should return 501 responses for the unimplemented commands
2011-04-07T11:43:02  <AutomatedTester> jleyba: thats what I was getting but wanted to check that it wasnt a general issue in my code
2011-04-07T11:43:57  <jleyba> jarib: ChromeDriverService started out as an extension of com.google.common.util.concurrent.AbstractService; I just kept the lock around when I killed the inheritance
2011-04-07T11:44:10  <jarib> gotcha
2011-04-07T11:44:12  <jleyba> I know it breaks away from our usual "WebDriver is not thread safe" mantra
2011-04-07T11:44:19  <jarib> yeah
2011-04-07T11:44:35  <jarib> i'll keep on ignoring that on the ruby side then :)
2011-04-07T11:45:09  <jarib> ato: around?
2011-04-07T11:45:11  <jleyba> AutomatedTester: The chromedriver is tested against the python bindings. You can find an up-to-date list of what works and doesn't here: http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/test/webdriver/WEBDRIVER_TESTS
2011-04-07T11:45:20  <jimevans> jleyba: i don't want to be "that guy" who asks the same question a second time two minutes after not getting a response from the first time, but what do i need to know for ChromeDriver.exe on Windows?
2011-04-07T11:46:05  <jimevans> jleyba: thanks for that link.
2011-04-07T11:46:22  <jleyba> Sorry, I saw you email but hadn't had a chance to respond
2011-04-07T11:46:29  <jimevans> i figured.
2011-04-07T11:46:47  <jimevans> i sent the email because I thought i wasn't going to be online at all today.
2011-04-07T11:46:53  <jleyba> a) I posted the wrong build yesterday (which jarib pointed out to me).  A newer build is on the downloads page now
2011-04-07T11:47:05  <jleyba> b) The chromedriver is tested with the python bindings (see aforementioned link)
2011-04-07T11:47:25  <jimevans> thanks.
2011-04-07T11:47:33  <jimevans> I'll update my build and see where it gets me.

2011-04-07T11:52:50  <jimevans> dunno. asking before i tried it. :)
2011-04-07T11:53:04  <santiycr> AutomatedTester: so the problem is that my path if fucked up
2011-04-07T11:53:27  <santiycr> AutomatedTester: remember I had this weird issue where py.__version__ wasn't there?
2011-04-07T11:53:47  <AutomatedTester> oh yea I remember that
2011-04-07T11:53:54  <jimevans> ahfeel_: good to know!
2011-04-07T11:53:57  <santiycr> I found out that when I run  "./go test_py" from trunk
2011-04-07T11:54:17  <santiycr> when a module imports py, it's importing selenium/trunk/py
2011-04-07T11:54:26  <santiycr> which is not what this library is expecting
2011-04-07T11:54:55  <santiycr> AutomatedTester: can you tell me what you get from:  "echo $PYTHONPATH" ?
2011-04-07T11:55:19  <AutomatedTester> nothing
2011-04-07T11:55:32  <santiycr> AutomatedTester: hm, do you run ./go from somewhere different from selenium/trunk?
2011-04-07T11:55:50  <jimevans> bloody hell the new chrome driver is fast. :)
2011-04-07T11:55:51  <AutomatedTester> I run it only there
2011-04-07T11:56:06  <santiycr> agh
2011-04-07T11:56:08  <santiycr> this is weird
2011-04-07T11:57:58  <jimevans> jleyba: you'll be glad to know that chrome tests run clean on windows with the updated exe.
2011-04-07T11:58:12  <jleyba> Sorry about that...
2011-04-07T11:58:36  <jimevans> no worries mate. just threw me for a loop.

2011-04-07T12:59:17  <antlong> carze, close just closes the window
2011-04-07T13:00:39  <carze> hmm... weird, though that when I closed the firefox driver the temp folders poofed
2011-04-07T13:01:11  <antlong> if its in /tmp itll get cleared by your OS anyway

2011-04-07T13:25:20  <santiycr> simonstewart explained that the full url is the expected result
2011-04-07T13:25:36  <AutomatedTester> it has changed then
2011-04-07T13:25:50  <AutomatedTester> and chrome has a bug then
2011-04-07T13:26:08  <santiycr> that's why I just changed the test
2011-04-07T13:26:33  <AutomatedTester> have you got a bug id for chrome then?
2011-04-07T13:27:34  <santiycr> not yet
2011-04-07T13:27:45  <AutomatedTester> ok cool
2011-04-07T13:28:31  <antlong> simonstewart, whats the reason for not having implicit waits on frame switching?
2011-04-07T13:28:42  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/webdriver-atoms/web_element.js#127
2011-04-07T13:28:51  <AutomatedTester> i will remove the -1 then
2011-04-07T13:28:52  <simonstewart> Frame switching should be instant
2011-04-07T13:29:12  <simonstewart> It's only findElement and interactions that cause implicit waits
2011-04-07T13:30:18  <antlong> simonstewart, if you click a link and it takes you to a new page, and you need to target an iframe on the newly loaded page it will fail for no good reason
2011-04-07T13:30:48  <antlong> simonstewart, which is why i bring this up. ive ran in to this a ton of times because of how gwt works (tons of frames)

2011-04-07T13:32:16  <santiycr> antlong: it did already
2011-04-07T13:32:17  <santiycr> oh, ok

2011-04-07T13:36:26  <kiorky> Rephrasing my problem : With the  firefox driver (pyhon ideally), how can i download a file. For example, i follow the "src" attribute of an <img/>, how can i download the image under the hood
2011-04-07T13:36:45  <santiycr> AutomatedTester: now I'm trying to run the google chrome tests

2011-04-07T13:38:03  <santiycr> otherwise, I don't tknow what the chromedriver is

2011-04-07T13:39:14  <santiycr> last question to avoid being annoying: any kind of doc I should have read to figure this one out?
2011-04-07T13:39:24  <jleyba> AutomatedTester: any chance you peaked at the chromedriver_launcher code used in chromium?
2011-04-07T13:39:34  <jleyba> Wondering if that might be reusable for the python bindings

2011-04-07T13:58:27  <antlong> santiycr, driver = Remote(executable_path='/Applications/......') might work

2011-04-07T14:02:06  <santiycr> antlong: using Chrome from ipython works
2011-04-07T14:02:09  <santiycr> but tests won't
2011-04-07T14:02:15  <santiycr> still researching
2011-04-07T14:02:28  <antlong> santiycr, ipython adds the cwd to your python path
2011-04-07T14:02:49  <santiycr> right
2011-04-07T14:03:01  <antlong> Chrome(executable_path="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome")

2011-04-07T14:03:11  <antlong> of what?
2011-04-07T14:03:29  <santiycr> when I run the tests I'm not using the last version of selenium python?
2011-04-07T14:03:36  <antlong> its a mac thing, theres no symlink put in /usr/bin or such
2011-04-07T14:03:36  <santiycr> still trying to figure that out
2011-04-07T14:04:06  <antlong> if you were on ubuntu lets say, they would add a link in /usr/bin (which is how `google-chrome` in terminal works)
2011-04-07T14:05:03  <antlong> santiycr, in your .profile just add /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/ to your $PATH
2011-04-07T14:07:24  <santiycr> antlong: still surprised about it working from ipython
2011-04-07T14:07:48  <antlong> santiycr, :) thats why people tend to avoid magic

2011-04-07T17:25:47  <antlong> eranm, did you want just test docstrings?
2011-04-07T17:26:02  <antlong> i can do that and a few small examples for you
2011-04-07T17:26:15  <simonstewart> antlong: back again
2011-04-07T17:26:19  <simonstewart> 'sup?
2011-04-07T17:26:42  <antlong> wanted to chat for a minute when you get a chance
2011-04-07T17:26:44  <eranm> antlong: that would be nice. Alternatively, a beefed-up example of a test case using the python bindings would also be useful
2011-04-07T17:26:57  <antlong> eranm, ok
2011-04-07T17:27:16  <eranm> Exploring the API at the source level is possible, but without a substantial example in Python it's hard to demonstrate it to python-savvy users
2011-04-07T17:27:23  <antlong> ill give you a heads up when im finishing it up. probably tommorrow
2011-04-07T17:27:35  <antlong> eranm, i do docstrings

2011-04-07T17:28:50  *** sfbrian has quit IRC
2011-04-07T17:28:52  <antlong> all the code in side the docstrings, on the top part are descriptions of what the module does. the bottom part, are doctests, so you can watch the tests run
2011-04-07T17:29:01  <eranm> That looks pretty good, we could do with such fancy docstrings
2011-04-07T17:29:18  <antlong> eranm, the ones i generate for work look like this:
2011-04-07T17:29:21  <santiycr> so it appears that if RemoteDriver requests something like iehta, Selenium 2 will assign htmlunit to it
2011-04-07T17:29:32  <santiycr> which can be confusing
2011-04-07T17:30:31  <santiycr> as it ends up being misleading, giving the user the idea that his tests are running as expected
2011-04-07T17:32:30  <antlong> eranm http://d.pr/IiBA
2011-04-07T17:33:14  <AutomatedTester> eranm: there is a quick example that works in docs/api/py/index.rst atm
2011-04-07T17:33:19  <eranm> santiycr: That's right, the Selenium 2 server provides the closest approximation but sometimes the right thing to do is to refuse to create a session
2011-04-07T17:34:20  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: do you have an idea when you might arrive down here?

2011-04-07T17:44:06  <eranm> Nafai: It looks like the albacore ruby gem is missing, except you're not supposed to encounter that problem because the built-in jruby has it

2011-04-07T17:46:12  <eranm> Nafai: can you try and install the missing gem on your system?
2011-04-07T17:46:38  <eranm> Prehaps jarib or simonstewart will have better idea why the build system is looking for gems outside of jruby
2011-04-07T17:46:46  <Nafai> I just tried something and fixed it. :)  I have GEM_HOME set and that seemed to overriding the system from using what was in jruby
2011-04-07T17:46:53  <Nafai> So I unset the environment variable and it works now
2011-04-07T17:47:10  <Nafai> I don't use ruby much so I hadn't thought about that

2011-04-07T21:03:39  * davehunt misusing IRC
2011-04-07T21:04:49  <nirvdrum> No worries.  I was just trying to find people to drink with.
2011-04-07T21:05:26  <AutomatedTester> nirvdrum: what about Simon?
2011-04-07T21:05:38  <davehunt> nirvdrum: Andy is still in SF
2011-04-07T21:05:40  <nirvdrum> I think he was headed out to MV for the evening.
2011-04-07T21:05:51  <AutomatedTester> really?
2011-04-07T21:06:00  <AutomatedTester> he is coming down tomorrow morning
2011-04-07T21:06:06  <AutomatedTester> well thats my impression
2011-04-07T21:06:12  <nirvdrum> jarib is supposed to be around, but I wouldn't know how to dial his crazy Norwegian phone.
2011-04-07T21:06:23  <nirvdrum> Oh.  I may have confused it.
