2011-03-13T07:04:37  <m1k3y> hi guys, i was looking at last year's GSoC ideas list here http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SEL/2010+Google+Summer+of+Code
2011-03-13T07:05:23  *** kylls has joined #selenium
2011-03-13T07:05:24  <m1k3y> and i saw that extending selenium drivers for android/ios was a project idea for last year
2011-03-13T07:05:42  <m1k3y> i can't seem to find any evidence of anybody actually working on this
2011-03-13T07:06:01  *** nirvdrum has joined #selenium
2011-03-13T07:06:17  <m1k3y> my question: would you like to raise this or appreciate this as a GSoC project idea again this year?
2011-03-13T07:06:55  <m1k3y> i have quite some experience with Android and would like take it up, if there is a need

2011-03-13T07:33:57  <jarib> m1k3y: the mobile drivers are quite far along (outside GSoC AFAIK)
2011-03-13T07:34:20  <jarib> m1k3y: you'll probably get better answers on the selenium-developers list though
2011-03-13T07:46:52  <m1k3y> jarib: i see
2011-03-13T07:49:35  <adamgoucher> but i'm sure there would be /something/ for a gsoc participant in them should there be the desire to hack on them
2011-03-13T07:51:39  *** kylls has quit IRC
2011-03-13T07:52:54  <jarib> adamgoucher: absolutely
2011-03-13T08:06:34  <adamgoucher> you should put webdriver-backed-selenium and selenium-backed-webdriver into the hands of a gsoc person :)
