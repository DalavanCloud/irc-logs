2011-08-21T10:21:19  <mydog2> hey andref  - any experience with firefox driver - inserting text.. firing an onchange event?
2011-08-21T10:21:36  <mydog2> been looking all over the net with no luck
2011-08-21T10:21:44  <andref> mydog2: sorry, but no, I'm learning...
2011-08-21T10:21:56  <ner0x> How do you check/uncheck a checkbox?
2011-08-21T10:22:23  <mydog2> yeah.. it almost appears that you can't insert text and invoke the onchange..
2011-08-21T10:22:33  <mydog2> ner0x, - what language...
2011-08-21T10:22:57  <ner0x> mydog2: perl, I assume I could find the right syntax once I knew the overall command.
2011-08-21T10:23:12  <mydog2> ner0x, - i agree...

2011-08-21T10:24:28  <andref> mydog2: hmm.. did you try doing recording in Selenium IDE and exporting it to your language?
2011-08-21T10:24:46  <ner0x> mydog2: Ah, that makes sense.
2011-08-21T10:24:55  <ner0x> mydog2: That works.
2011-08-21T10:25:14  <mydog2> basically.. you get your element.. and then click or not click.. depending on what you want to do.
2011-08-21T10:25:27  <mydog2> andref,  - i don't have an ide..
2011-08-21T10:26:51  <mydog2> andref,  - do you have an ide?
2011-08-21T10:27:24  <mydog2> ner0x,  - np...
2011-08-21T10:27:34  <mydog2> now if i can solve my issue..
2011-08-21T10:28:30  <andref> Yeah

2011-08-21T10:29:42  <mydog2> i fi can figure out how to insert "ACG" in the course section text..
2011-08-21T10:29:47  <mydog2> ner0x,  - cool..
2011-08-21T10:30:54  <mydog2> andref,  - what are you doing? maybe i can help you..

2011-08-21T11:35:17  <mydog2> i thought doing another find/click on another item would change the focus, and invoke the onChange for the text.. no luck.

2011-08-21T15:50:47  <mydog2> anybody here?
2011-08-21T16:02:19  <eghm> mydog2: do you know what ends up getting called on the change?  You could call that maybe.
2011-08-21T16:03:47  <mydog2> http://fpaste.org/dWCH/ <<<
2011-08-21T16:03:56  <mydog2> i tried to call it directly...
2011-08-21T16:04:17  <mydog2> i've tried a bunch of things.. might be user error.. but nothing has worked correctly.
2011-08-21T16:08:35  <eghm> ya, i don't mean tryiing to call the onChange
2011-08-21T16:09:25  <eghm> i'm talking about if you knew that code the onChange called.  Not very good design, but might work.  I call evals in SE 1 I know they work
2011-08-21T16:14:36  <mydog2> i can see the "text" flash on a few changes, but i don't have any soln that works
2011-08-21T16:30:09  <mydog2> eghm,  - have you ever resolved a situation similar to what i'm dealing with?

2011-08-21T17:44:40  <eghm> i thought i had, but wasn't seeing it in my tests, i suspect i made code changes to work around it.

2011-08-21T18:01:30  <Siph0n> I am using maven (2.2.1) with my cucumber/selenium (currently using selenium 1 api) project. I am trying to get it so I can give an argument on the mvn command line to run a different browser. Any one do something like this? I found the selenium-maven-plugin , but not what what I have to do in my java file to get it to work right.
2011-08-21T18:04:09  <mydog2> hey Siph0n  - no idea!!
2011-08-21T18:05:02  <mydog2> eghm,  - the funny thing... i downloaded the sel ide.. and did a auick test to see what it generated when i did a text insert...
2011-08-21T18:05:16  <mydog2> it generated the same code segments that i have..
2011-08-21T18:05:41  <mydog2> but when i run my test.. the text isn't being inserted.. so i assume the onchange isn't fired.

2011-08-21T18:22:01  *** sdimkov has quit IRC
2011-08-21T18:22:36  <eghm> what you are trying to do is insert text into a field?
2011-08-21T18:24:37  <mydog2> yeah.. and to invoke the onChange event for the text
2011-08-21T18:24:50  <mydog2> http://fpaste.org/dWCH/ <<<
2011-08-21T18:26:19  *** nirvdrum has quit IRC
2011-08-21T18:30:51  <eghm> mydog2: enless they made a bunch of changes i don't understand, getting text in a field has nothing to do with on change.  you use sendKeys, and it's commented out
2011-08-21T18:34:38  <mydog2> eghm,  - it would normally be that simple. did you look at the paste i provided?
2011-08-21T18:34:45  *** ian_mac2 has quit IRC
2011-08-21T18:34:52  <mydog2> in this case, you add the text..
2011-08-21T18:35:18  <mydog2> and the app invokes the "onChange" javascript when the text changes..
2011-08-21T18:35:35  *** nirvdrum has joined #selenium
2011-08-21T18:36:13  <mydog2> so any test has to accurately invoke/fire the onChange event
2011-08-21T18:40:36  <eghm> do you have text being entered into the field? i thought you said it just flashes?
2011-08-21T18:42:22  <mydog2> eghm,  - in the test, the code is inserted. when the test runs. you see the text flash in the text area.. for the test to work, the text has to be solidly in the text area, which is required in order to be able to generate the next page.
2011-08-21T18:42:47  <eghm> so no text?
2011-08-21T18:42:52  <mydog2> the onchange is not being implemented...
2011-08-21T18:43:17  *** Archdude has quit IRC
2011-08-21T18:43:30  <mydog2> if the onchange was implemented, and the underlying javascript run, the text would be displayed
2011-08-21T18:43:32  <eghm> i don't get that text flashed in, never seen that
2011-08-21T18:44:12  <mydog2> are you looking at the ucf page?

2011-08-21T18:50:05  <mydog2> are you running java? firefox?
2011-08-21T18:51:09  <eghm> no plug-ins no dev, sorry i ain't tracing by hand, i got work i gotta do
2011-08-21T18:51:25  <mydog2> no prob..
2011-08-21T18:51:55  <mydog2> the issue comes down to simply being able to do the text insert, and fire up the onChange event..
