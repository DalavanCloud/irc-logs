2011-06-10T08:29:03  <jimevans> YuriKl: because attempting to simulate user input by using windows messages is fundamentally broken.
2011-06-10T08:29:55  *** kenkoontz has joined #selenium
2011-06-10T08:30:05  <jimevans> and IE's mouse tracking in its message loop invalidates messages sent.
2011-06-10T08:30:37  <polm> Out of curiosity, how often do new chromedriver builds go up?
2011-06-10T08:30:54  <YuriKl> What are the alternatives ?
2011-06-10T08:31:11  <jimevans> none that are attractive.
2011-06-10T08:31:30  <jimevans> the alternatives are as follows:
2011-06-10T08:31:54  <jimevans> 1. use native events as currently implemented, which are broken in the mouse movement case
2011-06-10T08:32:17  <jimevans> 2. use the SendInput API, but this requires the IE window to be focused
2011-06-10T08:33:01  <jimevans> 3. use simulated events, which are limited by the javascript sandbox, and can block since they're synchronous
2011-06-10T08:33:20  <jimevans> that's it. that's all we have.
2011-06-10T08:36:09  <YuriKl> Well, both 1 & 2 basically mean IE can only be done on a designated machine, but I think it is better than 3, which is too weak in my opinion
2011-06-10T08:37:14  <YuriKl> Using simulated events won't let you do things like interact with Modal Diaoluges , or possibly close windows in some situations
2011-06-10T08:37:28  *** nirvdrum has quit IRC
2011-06-10T08:37:47  <jimevans> absolutely right. i fully support using native events, and know all the reasons why we should.
2011-06-10T08:37:54  <jimevans> ie is just broken with them.
2011-06-10T08:39:25  <YuriKl> I see
2011-06-10T08:40:15  <jimevans> i'm not even fully convinced that SendInput() would solve the problem.
2011-06-10T08:41:05  <jimevans> though that's the "official" way of simulating mouse/keyboard input events.
2011-06-10T08:41:11  *** yairgo has quit IRC
2011-06-10T08:42:23  <YuriKl> The official way isn't the InternetExplorer Object ?
2011-06-10T08:42:50  <jimevans> sorry, the official way of doing so in the Windows OS.
2011-06-10T08:43:19  <jimevans> yes, i'm sure Microsoft would say, "use the COM object model", but that leads to potential blocking problems with modal dialogs.
2011-06-10T08:43:52  <YuriKl> Okay, well I think most people don't really require to have the tests run on their own machine.
2011-06-10T08:45:16  <YuriKl> Though, honeslty, my lack of actual knowledge in this area is complete. I wonder if it possible to get some of the guys that work/worked on IE to give us some tips.
2011-06-10T08:46:10  <jimevans> YuriKl: I've been trying for months. There is a great deal of institutional resistance to providing guidance outside of Microsoft.
2011-06-10T08:46:25  <jimevans> (I know, I've been there)
2011-06-10T08:49:37  <YuriKl> That is very unfourtenate. Does IE try to catch all mouse movements messages or just those that are on IE windows ?
2011-06-10T08:50:24  *** reddeviL is now known as red^
2011-06-10T08:50:46  <jimevans> i'm pretty sure it only catches those messages sent to it, but it appears there's some sort of hit-testing going on in IE's normal event processing.
2011-06-10T08:52:41  <YuriKl> And that hit testing messes things up ?
2011-06-10T08:54:04  <jimevans> you bet it does. consider the case of hovering over an element. we send windows messages to simulate putting the mouse cursor over the element.
2011-06-10T08:54:10  *** nirvdrum has joined #selenium
2011-06-10T08:55:20  <jimevans> if the physical mouse cursor is over the ie window and the ie window is in focus, ie immediately recognizes that the mouse cursor isn't physically over the element, and ie then places the cursor at the physical location
2011-06-10T08:56:22  <jimevans> if the physical mouse cursor isn't over the ie window, the hover appears to work, but only for about .5 seconds, then ie realizes the cursor isn't there and "cleans up" the cursor location.
2011-06-10T08:56:59  <YuriKl> It sounds almost like IE resists being tricked
2011-06-10T08:57:25  <YuriKl> Is it possible for us to run IE as another user ? I'm assuming an IE instance on a different user is an entirely different session
2011-06-10T08:57:55  <jimevans> I don't understand why running as another user would matter.

2011-06-10T09:00:17  <YuriKl> I think I read somewhere about that. It was about someone having a problem because IE was trying to combine a few instances or something, I will look for it.
2011-06-10T09:00:35  <jimevans> oh, you mean session merging. not different windows users.
2011-06-10T09:00:48  <jimevans> no, we should be explicitly coding around that.
2011-06-10T09:01:08  <jimevans> it's why we use the IELaunchURL() API instead of CoCreateInstance to start IE.
2011-06-10T09:04:16  *** ammar01 has quit IRC
2011-06-10T09:04:18  <YuriKl> It is interesting to know if windows supports two different users at the same time. Say one sits in front of the computer and the other connects remotely using the network. If windows does support that, and I think it does, then the mouse events of one user are seperated from those of the other one.
2011-06-10T09:04:51  <YuriKl> And then, if we run the driver as another windows user...
2011-06-10T09:04:53  <rpk> yes of course it dowes

2011-06-10T09:05:00  <jimevans> well, yes, but now you're getting into terminal server behavior.
2011-06-10T09:05:00  <rpk> run as accomplishes this
2011-06-10T09:05:44  <jimevans> and while you can launch an application with different credentials ("as a different user"), it's still on the same desktop as the launching user.
2011-06-10T09:06:04  <jimevans> so, no, the mouse events of one user are not necessarily separated from those of another.
2011-06-10T09:06:21  <jimevans> now the mouse events of one desktop session are isolated from that of another.

2011-06-10T09:07:09  <jimevans> but then you can't visually inspect the code as it's running, which to my mind is a *huge* benefit in automating a real browser.
2011-06-10T09:07:23  <jimevans> otherwise, i'd just use one of the headless browsers and not bother with selenium at all.
2011-06-10T09:08:40  <YuriKl> That is true, I can think of solutions to that too, but they make things more and more complex
2011-06-10T09:10:19  <YuriKl> But the main reason I don't use a headless driver isn't because I can't see what it does, but because I know it has different quirks than the actual browser.

2011-06-10T09:19:15  <jimevans> as far as i'm concerned, running the browser, visibly, on the machine the tests are running is a hard and fast requirement for me. and i'd be willing to bet i'm not the only one.

2011-06-10T09:32:49  <YuriKl> I tried doing the "go test_ie" thingy on every snapshot since 2.03b and it never passed. Trying again now.
2011-06-10T09:33:15  <jimevans> yep, there are going to be challenges there.
2011-06-10T09:33:40  <jimevans> known issues: sometimes there's a checkbox test that fails early on the test suite.
2011-06-10T09:34:12  <jimevans> later, there's a test for sending the backspace keystroke that can fail, depending on window focus.

2011-06-10T09:36:35  <YuriKl> Okay, what do I do if I don't pass those ? Actually, how do I debug tests that fail if I run them using rake ?
2011-06-10T09:37:44  <jleyba> polm: window.onerror doesn't work in every browser, and I want to avoid modifying the AUT
2011-06-10T09:37:47  <jimevans> YuriKl: to debug the java code, you'll need to run them from within a java ide. intellij's idea seems to be popular among the dev team.
2011-06-10T09:37:58  <polm> Ah.
2011-06-10T09:38:20  <jrock20041> Looking for an ide that is lighter than eclipse but still has the nice method completion stuff. Anyone know of anything?
2011-06-10T09:38:25  <jimevans> YuriKl: and then to debug the C++ code, you'd have to attach to the process in Visual Studio.
2011-06-10T09:39:18  <jimevans> That's one of the reasons i use C# a lot. I can start the NUnit.exe test runner, and attach to it to debug the native code pretty easily.
2011-06-10T09:40:07  <jimevans> Then run the tests at will, since the test runner is a standalone application.
2011-06-10T09:40:57  <jimevans> (i'm not sure how visual studio would react to attaching to a java process running a java ide, which is a debugger itself)
2011-06-10T09:42:18  <YuriKl> Well, I will try to make that work first, and move to the c# binding if I can't. It should be possible.

2011-06-10T09:43:35  <YuriKl> According to this : http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriverInternals running the tests is not too trivial, but it also seems to be out of date because the Java code is in a different structure now.

2011-06-10T10:01:35  <jimevans> on the plus side, the C++ code is much easier to understand than it used to be
2011-06-10T10:02:46  <YuriKl> okay, so I won't rely on it much.
2011-06-10T10:03:26  <YuriKl> When I know enough to update it, I will do it.
2011-06-10T10:04:37  <jimevans> in general, the driver starts an HTTP server (using the mongoose web server project) and the language bindings communicate with the driver sessions via the remote JSON wire protocol.
2011-06-10T10:06:49  <jimevans> each session is managed by a hidden window that uses the COM automation classes to drive IE.

2011-06-10T11:28:34  <autojack> the Xvfb wikipedia entry seems to say that you can do Xvfb + VNC. I don't get how VNC could run in isolation.

2011-06-10T13:56:33  <nirvdrum> Eol: WinSafari 5 currently does not work.
2011-06-10T13:56:51  <Eol> ? I meant "safari on windows"
2011-06-10T13:56:58  <nirvdrum> But I recommend using grid if you need that fine control over each of the browsers & platforms.
2011-06-10T13:57:14  <Eol> Well, its not so much grid that's an issue
2011-06-10T13:57:20  <nirvdrum> I know what you meant :-)  Selenium doesn't work with Safari 5 on Windows.
2011-06-10T13:57:25  <Eol> oh, i see
2011-06-10T13:58:07  <Eol> Well, I know how i'd go about selenium grid.  My issue is that for a screenshot to work, it takes a picture of the entire OS.  So that means that I can only have 1 SS at a time going.  Which means if I wanted to parallelize, I'd need to have 12 different VMs
2011-06-10T13:58:27  <Eol> And the mac OSX licensing blows, since I can't virtualize the client.. so I'd have to be running at least 3 MacOSX servers
2011-06-10T14:00:15  <nirvdrum> Correct.
2011-06-10T14:00:31  <nirvdrum> Unless you use full canvas screenshots, which aren't supported on all the browsers listed.
2011-06-10T14:01:00  <Eol> Didn't know if there were any tricks about using a terminal services or anything like that to cut down on the number of VMs
2011-06-10T14:01:09  <Eol> So does my theory work out? Has anyone done it in practice?
2011-06-10T14:01:39  <Eol> is there a list anywhere of what browsers support full-canvas screenshots?
2011-06-10T14:02:00  <nirvdrum> Pretty much just firefox and then IE with SnapsIE.
2011-06-10T14:02:32  <Eol> hmm, is this you: www.nirvdrum.com//2010/03/25/how-to-take-full-page-or-full-canvas-screenshots-in-windows.html
2011-06-10T14:02:38  <nirvdrum> Indeed.
2011-06-10T14:02:55  <nirvdrum> Although I knocked that server offline a couple days ago.
2011-06-10T14:03:09  <nirvdrum> The Ubuntu install was woefully out of date.
2011-06-10T14:03:35  <Eol> What are the technical limitations of why the browsers don't support full canvas screenshots? Is it the browser code itself, or the selenium implementation
2011-06-10T14:04:28  <Eol> it seems like browsershots.org is able to provide full canvas for safari on mac
2011-06-10T14:06:06  <nirvdrum> They're likely using a utility outside of safari.
2011-06-10T14:06:27  <nirvdrum> E.g., you can use the safari renderer and dump out a screenshot.
2011-06-10T14:06:34  <nirvdrum> This is fairly common on mac.
2011-06-10T14:06:49  <nirvdrum> But you're not really testing the browser in that case.
2011-06-10T14:06:59  <Eol> howso?
2011-06-10T14:07:21  <nirvdrum> Because you're using a custom control that just happens to use the same rendering engine.
2011-06-10T14:09:22  <Eol> ah, i see.  Well, for us its mostly testing the CSS in that case to make sure we didn't break crap
2011-06-10T14:09:38  <Eol> since we care very much about "pixel-perfect" results in a lot of cases

2011-06-10T15:29:42  <AutomatedTester> it has a lot of similarities with the JSON Wire protocol
