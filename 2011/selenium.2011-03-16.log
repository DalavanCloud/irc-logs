2011-03-16T05:38:57  <jimevans> g'day simonstewart
2011-03-16T05:39:17  <simonstewart> Need any more info for the podcast?
2011-03-16T05:39:33  <jimevans> no, i think i'm all set. thanks a ton.
2011-03-16T05:39:38  <simonstewart> No worries
2011-03-16T05:39:52  <simonstewart> Good idea of yours.
2011-03-16T05:39:57  <simonstewart> Let's find out if it works :)
2011-03-16T05:41:05  <simonstewart> Oooff. I should live on email more
2011-03-16T05:41:17  <simonstewart> > 100 unread messages in my webdriver folder
2011-03-16T05:41:23  <jimevans> which idea? reaching out to hanselman and haack?
2011-03-16T05:41:58  <simonstewart> yup
2011-03-16T05:42:55  <jimevans> can't take full credit for it. someone on twitter suggested it after one of my provocative tweets about getting MSFT involved.
2011-03-16T05:43:07  <jimevans> anyway, we record tomorrow at noon ET.
2011-03-16T05:43:14  <simonstewart> Excellent :)
2011-03-16T05:43:49  <jimevans> I'll be sure to let everyone know when it goes live, so we can include it in the next Se roundup on the blog.

2011-03-16T05:56:06  <simonstewart> Awesomeness
2011-03-16T05:56:26  <simonstewart> So all that's left is Firefox 4
2011-03-16T05:56:32  <simonstewart> Which is almost there
2011-03-16T05:56:37  <jimevans> there are some occasional flakiness in the tests, but they happened with ie8 too.
2011-03-16T05:56:43  <simonstewart> Indeed
2011-03-16T05:57:05  <simonstewart> That's really kicked the day off in a great way :)
2011-03-16T05:57:07  <jimevans> anyway, i've been able to run green for the java tests in ie9
2011-03-16T05:57:30  <simonstewart> Woot.
2011-03-16T05:57:30  <jimevans> .net too, for the most part.
2011-03-16T05:57:42  <simonstewart> For the most part?
2011-03-16T05:58:04  <jimevans> yeah, they're a little more flaky than the java tests, because the java tests ignore some scenarios the .net tests don't
2011-03-16T05:58:17  <simonstewart> We can always unignore them....
2011-03-16T05:58:25  *** csanchez has joined #selenium
2011-03-16T05:58:54  <jimevans> true, but then you won't get coverage because the java tests stop at first failure.
2011-03-16T06:00:19  <simonstewart> I should change that at some point
2011-03-16T06:04:00  <jimevans> I do have some things to be aware of that are current sticking points for IE
2011-03-16T06:05:10  <jimevans> in org.openqa.selenium.ClickTest.testCanClickOnALinkAndFollowIt(), the assert sometimes checks for the title too quickly, and you can get a failure that way.
2011-03-16T06:06:14  *** fuzzygroove has left #selenium
2011-03-16T06:07:16  <jimevans> check boxes seem flaky, most often manifesting as a failure in CorrectEventFiringTest.testShouldEmitOnChangeEventsWhenChangingTheStateOfACheckbox()
2011-03-16T06:08:40  <jimevans> if the IE window doesn't have focus, TypingTest.testDeleteAndBackspaceKeys() will fail because the backspace gets sent to the IE window, causing a history back navigation
2011-03-16T06:10:22  <jimevans> in .net, the equivalent of ExecutingAsyncJavascriptTest.shouldDetectPageLoadsWhileWaitingOnAnAsyncScriptAndReturnAnError() fails sometimes. Dunno why. Test is ignored in Java.
2011-03-16T06:11:39  <jimevans> also in .net, the equivalent of WindowSwitchingTest.testShouldBeAbleToIterateOverAllOpenWindows() sometimes fails because the click sets focus to the link in the background window but doesn't process it as a link click. Test is also ignored in Java.
2011-03-16T06:12:02  <jimevans> that's the state of the art in IE.
2011-03-16T06:12:57  <jimevans> and not specific to IE9; they were issues before r11692

2011-03-16T06:17:31  <primehaxor> morning
2011-03-16T06:18:32  <primehaxor> guys there's a way to monitor how many time each component wait for load?
2011-03-16T06:18:56  <primehaxor> for example, the abc.jpg - 10 seconds
2011-03-16T06:21:35  <AutomatedTester> primehaxor: you want the network traffic?
2011-03-16T06:21:57  <primehaxor> AutomatedTester, no, just the time for each object in the page
2011-03-16T06:22:16  <AutomatedTester> ok, so you want the network traffic in HAR
2011-03-16T06:22:27  <primehaxor> index.html = 10 seconds
2011-03-16T06:22:37  <primehaxor> product.jpg = 4
2011-03-16T06:22:40  <primehaxor> something like that
2011-03-16T06:22:49  <primehaxor> but using the selenium api
2011-03-16T06:22:56  <AutomatedTester> the only way to get that is monitoring the network traffic into the browser
2011-03-16T06:23:23  <primehaxor> hmmm
2011-03-16T06:23:33  <AutomatedTester> https://github.com/AutomatedTester/AutomatedTester.PagePerf
2011-03-16T06:23:40  <AutomatedTester> something I did with Selenium 2
2011-03-16T06:24:02  <AutomatedTester> since its collecting a HAR, which has the info you want, you can then check everything
2011-03-16T06:24:29  <AutomatedTester> i did that in c# when working for a .NET company

2011-03-16T06:25:52  <primehaxor> btw you know something to control chrome?
2011-03-16T06:26:02  <primehaxor> i use python for codes
2011-03-16T06:26:19  <AutomatedTester> i dont understand the question
2011-03-16T06:26:29  <primehaxor> some api for control
2011-03-16T06:26:31  <AutomatedTester> my first instinct is selenium but I am assuming you dont mean that
2011-03-16T06:26:49  <primehaxor> attach a debug on the browser

2011-03-16T06:27:32  <simonstewart> jimevans: thanks for the recap
2011-03-16T06:27:38  <AutomatedTester> you cant currently attach to an open browser
2011-03-16T06:27:40  <simonstewart> Bit worrying about the backspace problem
2011-03-16T06:28:28  <jimevans> simonstewart: no worries. i wanted to get it out there.
2011-03-16T06:29:01  <jimevans> i don't know how long the backspace thing has been around. i've debugged it, and it looks like the keystroke gets sent properly.
2011-03-16T06:29:43  <primehaxor> AutomatedTester, hell yeah, that was i've looking for
2011-03-16T06:30:14  <AutomatedTester> primehaxor: I have a lot of love for client side profiling

2011-03-16T06:48:04  <davehunt> do you know what the status of Selenium IDE is?
2011-03-16T06:48:33  <simonstewart> In what way?
2011-03-16T06:48:37  <simonstewart> It should be working
2011-03-16T06:48:50  <simonstewart> Though Core doesn't (yet) work with Firefox 4
2011-03-16T06:48:58  <simonstewart> So expect there to be problems running tests
2011-03-16T06:49:29  <davehunt> Well I raised issue 1404 today
2011-03-16T06:49:40  <simonstewart> #1404

2011-03-16T06:50:10  <simonstewart> Might well have to do with the Core not working properly with Firefox 4
2011-03-16T06:50:12  <davehunt> It would be awesome to release IDE 1.0.11 as it has some fixes in
2011-03-16T06:50:17  <simonstewart> XPCOM 2 has thrown a few things out
2011-03-16T06:50:32  <davehunt> It also would allow me to enable more Mozmill tests

2011-03-16T06:54:34  <simonstewart> We're down to 1 failure and 3 errors for the firefox tests
2011-03-16T06:54:43  <simonstewart> I need to test with a previous release, then I'll check in my WIP
2011-03-16T06:54:54  <davehunt> Any suggestions for a way to detect the browser other than user agent string, or should I just add Namoroka/Shiretoko to that code?
2011-03-16T06:55:26  <simonstewart> Prolly best to add those to the code
2011-03-16T06:56:12  <davehunt> Sure, and issues with any future codenames should be picked up by our Mozmill tests
2011-03-16T06:56:23  <davehunt> I should have a blog post on that in the few couple of weeks
2011-03-16T06:56:28  <davehunt> few couple? :P
2011-03-16T06:56:40  <davehunt> I meant couple :)

2011-03-16T08:21:40  <antlong> simonstewart, i noticed that there are a handful of methods that are incompatible with certain desired capabilities, like htmlunit cant take screenshots, do you have interest in hiding incompatible methods?
2011-03-16T08:21:47  <antlong> AutomatedTester ^
2011-03-16T08:22:04  <simonstewart> In the java world, we just don't implement the interfaces
2011-03-16T08:22:14  <simonstewart> Not sure what python would do
2011-03-16T08:22:16  <AutomatedTester> antlong: i need to rip things aparnt
2011-03-16T08:22:18  <simonstewart> Throw an exception?
2011-03-16T08:22:44  <antlong> that might be good, the exception that comes back from the driver incinuates it might work
2011-03-16T08:22:57  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: what I am probably going to do is use Pythons multiple inheritence to handle it
2011-03-16T08:23:02  <simonstewart> ok
2011-03-16T08:23:10  <simonstewart> so long as it's possible :)
2011-03-16T08:23:11  <AutomatedTester> so you cant call it if that item isnt on that driver
2011-03-16T08:23:18  <AutomatedTester> its on my todo
2011-03-16T08:23:30  * AutomatedTester is currently rewriting the firefoxdriver to make it work properly
2011-03-16T08:23:44  <antlong> AutomatedTester, wouldnt you have to class out groups of methods  then?
2011-03-16T08:24:10  <AutomatedTester> antlong: yes, but I would split them in a similar way to java has
2011-03-16T08:24:20  <AutomatedTester> but to the end user they wont notice the difference
2011-03-16T08:24:27  <AutomatedTester> because the calls will still be there
2011-03-16T08:24:51  <AutomatedTester> but if you look in the file they arent in the driver class, they are in its parent
2011-03-16T08:25:13  <AutomatedTester> antlong: we need to do something along those lines for Advanced User Actions

2011-03-16T08:27:00  <antlong> oh i see
2011-03-16T08:27:29  <AutomatedTester> i would rather let the language go "thats not there" than casting and capturing the exception and cleaning it up for the user

2011-03-16T08:29:22  <AutomatedTester> jarib and I had a good old chat how we want to do this for dynamic typed languages
2011-03-16T08:30:52  <AutomatedTester> also, if we were to do things like this we can create an android driver and iphone driver like Java has
2011-03-16T08:30:58  <AutomatedTester> which for me is a +1
2011-03-16T08:31:33  <antlong> yeah definitely useful, im just wondering if it makes more sense to have desired capabilities be a class which contains the logic of which capablity has what methods
2011-03-16T08:33:51  <AutomatedTester> i think something like that would be a core change since the desired capabilites dictionary gets updated by data returned to driver
2011-03-16T08:34:00  *** sburjan has quit IRC
2011-03-16T08:35:07  <antlong> i cant remember the exact amount, but theres some arbitrary limit to the amount of items you can have in a class definitions inheritance
2011-03-16T08:36:40  <antlong> simonstewart, howd the ssl task wind up going?
2011-03-16T08:38:04  <AutomatedTester> antlong: tbh I am not going to go bazurk on it, if its in all drivers it can stay in the core, if its in select browsers then see about splitting it
2011-03-16T08:38:53  <antlong> AutomatedTester, probably a good idea. i think you can use the key of desired_capabilities to return an exception for specific drivers also
2011-03-16T08:39:09  <AutomatedTester> that makes sense
2011-03-16T08:40:03  <simonstewart> antlong: 'tis done
2011-03-16T08:40:16  <antlong> oh, the other thing, i think we should import desired capabilities directly in the __init__, so you can just do Remote(HTMLUNIT, x,y,z)

2011-03-16T12:48:40  <True_Blue> I have created several custom asserts.  I'm thinking about adding them to my custom WebDriver and WebElement classes, so that I can execute driver.assertCurrentUrlContains("index.htm");  Is there any reason that its better to keep them as helper methods?
2011-03-16T12:50:36  <simonstewart> One of the basic theories of OO design is to give each class or interface one, and only one, role or responsibility
2011-03-16T12:50:57  <simonstewart> Adding assertions separate from your webdriver/webelement break this
2011-03-16T12:51:11  <simonstewart> What I tend to do is follow the pattern of junit's Assert class
2011-03-16T12:51:17  <simonstewart> And just have a bunch of static methods
2011-03-16T12:51:20  <antlong> True_Blue, also if you wanted to run your tests somewhere else, you would need to run your specific version of the code, which then means you have to maintain a fork

2011-03-16T12:53:27  <True_Blue> true, good points.  The reason I had thought about this idea was because in some of them I need to pass in an element, and I just saw it would be easier.  But when thinking it over, it seemed like I would be cluttering too much into those Objects

2011-03-16T13:40:12  <True_Blue> hmm I have my asserts set up this way so that within each one, I can do a call for the url multiple times.  Within assertCurrentUrlContains("text"), I do a call of driver.getCurrentUrl.contains("text"), and if it fails, it sleeps for one second, and then does it again, and it does this up to 5 times
2011-03-16T13:40:34  <True_Blue> If I pass in the driver.getCurrentUrl() text, it would never change
2011-03-16T13:40:48  <antlong> pass in the function
2011-03-16T13:41:13  <antlong> assertContains(driver.getCurrentUrl(), '/foo')

2011-03-16T13:42:11  <True_Blue> driver.getCurrentUrl() will give assertContains a String, correct?
2011-03-16T13:42:22  *** |izzie has joined #selenium
2011-03-16T13:42:43  <antlong> whatever it normally returns, which should be a string
2011-03-16T13:43:11  <antlong> what language are you doing this in again? python?
2011-03-16T13:43:14  <True_Blue> Java
2011-03-16T13:43:48  <antlong> i dont know much about java, but the implementation should be equivalent
2011-03-16T13:45:37  <True_Blue> What I do, is assertCurrentUrlContains(WebDriver driver, String str), then within the assertCurrentUrlContains, I do a driver.getCurrentUrl.contains(str), if this is not true, then I sleep one second and then do driver.getCurrentUrl.contains(str) over again.  If its not true again, I do it again and so on until 5 times, then I throw an Exception.  If it does end up being true, then I just
2011-03-16T13:45:37  <True_Blue> break from the loop and everything is fine
2011-03-16T13:45:37  *** Mayank has quit IRC
2011-03-16T13:45:51  <True_Blue> If I pass in the driver.getCurrentUrl() string, there's no point in looping through
2011-03-16T13:45:56  <antlong> might as well just pass an integer in to your assert
2011-03-16T13:45:56  <True_Blue> that String will always be the same
2011-03-16T13:46:12  <antlong> assertContains('foo', 5) and use the integer as the iterable
2011-03-16T13:47:37  <True_Blue> true, I could do that.  Right now I'm just using 5 by default.  What i dont like about this, is I have to create an assert for every single thing, because within that assert, I have to keep revaluationg my condition and going to get a new one, i.e driver.getCurrentUrl(), driver.getTitle(), element.getText(), etc
2011-03-16T13:47:44  <True_Blue> I was hoping there would be an easier way
2011-03-16T13:48:13  <antlong> i dont get why you need this
2011-03-16T13:48:54  <antlong> this is what the implicit wait functionality is intended for
2011-03-16T13:53:59  <selbot2_> eran.mes@gmail.com half a minute ago - EranMes: Cleaning up the large Select test. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11703
2011-03-16T13:55:43  <True_Blue> The implicit wait functionality seemed to only work for elements
2011-03-16T13:56:00  <True_Blue> Not things like driver.getCurrentUrl, or driver.getTitle
2011-03-16T13:56:23  <True_Blue> Also, does implicit wait do a wait for exactly that amount of time?
2011-03-16T13:56:35  <True_Blue> If I do an implicit wait of 5 seconds, will it do a 5 second wait each time?
2011-03-16T13:56:44  <antlong> no, it retries the command for that length of time
2011-03-16T13:56:45  <True_Blue> Or is it built in to stop waiting once it finds it
2011-03-16T13:56:49  <True_Blue> ahh ok I see
2011-03-16T13:56:55  <True_Blue> Does it work for driver methods?
2011-03-16T13:56:58  <True_Blue> Or just elements?
2011-03-16T13:57:28  <antlong> not positive, but i would think the element is derived from a method, so it should work

2011-03-16T14:01:23  <True_Blue> I'll take a look at it again.  You are right that even if it doesn't, it does reduce the need for the asserts for Elements to have the waits

2011-03-16T14:04:12  <antlong> you should only assert when youre sure you have the data you actually need to compare with
2011-03-16T14:04:16  *** jonathanrwallace has joined #selenium
2011-03-16T14:04:54  <simonstewart> OK. So it looks like the nastiness is "somewhere" in the code that detects whether a new page has loaded
2011-03-16T14:05:27  *** jeffmoss has joined #selenium
2011-03-16T14:05:44  <True_Blue> IE has a problem where sometimes after I do a click(), when I try to get the CurrentUrl, it will still get the old pages url.  I can add a sleep after the click and it will mitigate the problem somewhat, but sometimes a bad url will still get through
2011-03-16T14:05:57  <True_Blue> This is where I started thinking about the waits
2011-03-16T14:06:00  <True_Blue> within the assert
2011-03-16T14:07:05  <jeffmoss> anybody know about saucelabs.com ? looks pretty good, I was going to sign up... looking for happy/angry customers
2011-03-16T14:07:27  <True_Blue> So even if I used the implicit wait, it really wouldnt help me.  The page finds a url, and then does a compare.  The problem is, it found the old url and not the new one after the click
2011-03-16T14:07:28  <Archdude> sauce is cool
2011-03-16T14:07:34  <Archdude> ive played with it a bit
2011-03-16T14:07:34  <antlong> jeffmoss, what do you need to do
2011-03-16T14:07:51  <True_Blue> Thats where having the wait within the assert, it checks it over and over again and then finally throws an Exception if it didnt get it
2011-03-16T14:08:21  <jeffmoss> antlong: I want automated testing
2011-03-16T14:08:34  <Archdude> do you already have automated tests??
2011-03-16T14:08:37  <jeffmoss> something headless, I was going to set up a box, but $50/month seems like a deal
2011-03-16T14:08:54  <jeffmoss> I've played with selenium, I want something stable that the team can count on
2011-03-16T14:09:32  <antlong> jeffmoss, i dont think sauce is headless
2011-03-16T14:09:37  <Archdude> yeah, it's not
2011-03-16T14:09:53  <Archdude> there's still going to be a lot of time spent writing the scripts
2011-03-16T14:09:57  <Archdude> sauce is just a way to run it
2011-03-16T14:10:01  <jeffmoss> what am I paying for then? I thought I was paying for a service that runs browsers on the cloud and I don't have to deal with any of that stuff
2011-03-16T14:10:23  <jeffmoss> well, yeah firefox plugin would be my chore
2011-03-16T14:10:25  <antlong> jeffmoss, they resell you the amazon ec2 instance, and they add their own functionality
2011-03-16T14:10:33  <Archdude> yeah
2011-03-16T14:10:39  <Archdude> a selenium RC server is more simple than using sauce
2011-03-16T14:10:42  <jeffmoss> so I tell sauce to "go" and it runs all my tests on whichever browsers I want right?
2011-03-16T14:11:16  <Archdude> not really
2011-03-16T14:11:23  <Archdude> you run the test as you'd do normally with RC
2011-03-16T14:11:28  <Archdude> except it runs on sauce
2011-03-16T14:11:38  <Archdude> and then you can log onto your sauce account and check results, watch the video, etc
2011-03-16T14:13:48  <jeffmoss> what do you mean sauce isn't headless?  by headless I just meant a cloud VM running an x-server
2011-03-16T14:13:50  <Archdude> the FF plugin only currently supports one test at a time
2011-03-16T14:14:05  <antlong> jeffmoss, thats not what headless is
2011-03-16T14:14:18  <jeffmoss> a server at a datacenter pretending like it's a desktop
2011-03-16T14:14:59  <antlong> thats remote :) not headless
2011-03-16T14:16:45  <Archdude> a time you install their VPN client on your network and configured everything you probably could have already installed a bunch of browsers on a machine and ran the tests
2011-03-16T14:17:16  <Archdude> but it's good if you need to tests lots of different browsers
2011-03-16T14:17:52  <jeffmoss> yeah well sounds like it doesn't suck, I'll try it for a month thanks for the input guys
2011-03-16T14:17:52  <antlong> jeffmoss, sign up for amazon web services, launch an instance of whatever OS you want, and install open-jdk and firefox on it and you're all set
2011-03-16T14:17:54  <Archdude> i think theyre improving with time but still have a bit more to do
2011-03-16T14:18:04  <Archdude> they still dont have OS X yet as far as i know
2011-03-16T14:18:18  <antlong> i dont think you can license os-x on amazon
2011-03-16T14:18:22  <jeffmoss> the windows stuff is a big help though right
2011-03-16T14:18:24  <antlong> rather amazon cant license os-x
2011-03-16T14:18:35  <antlong> jeffmoss, windows on ec2 is expensive
2011-03-16T14:18:53  <Archdude> yeah it's definitely worth trying jeffmoss
2011-03-16T14:18:56  <simonstewart> jeffmoss: if you don't want to admin the machines then sauce is a choice

2011-03-16T14:20:46  <jeffmoss> well, integrate it with our code deployments or something, make it just email stuff
2011-03-16T14:20:50  <jeffmoss> without any intervention
2011-03-16T14:21:00  <jeffmoss> and without any maintenance

2011-03-16T14:22:15  <Archdude> what's it emailing?
2011-03-16T14:22:29  <antlong> jeffmoss, honestly youre not going to find a service that does all the things you need. you might as well just run your own instance on ec2 and install hudson or jenkins on it.
2011-03-16T14:22:39  <jeffmoss> well I have automated unit testing, it just emails out the results of the unit tests
2011-03-16T14:22:56  <antlong> jeffmoss, those run locally, big difference
2011-03-16T14:25:04  <simonstewart> Right. Time to go and look like I know what I'm talking about
