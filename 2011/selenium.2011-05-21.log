2011-05-21T08:01:46  <__mike> Hi all. I'm building the current trunk with go //java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/server:server:uber //java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote:client-combined:uber
2011-05-21T08:02:12  <__mike> I assumed the server-standalone.jar in \build\java\server\src\org\openqa\selenium\remote\server is a similar one to the one you can download
2011-05-21T08:02:41  <__mike> I added this to the buildpath on eclipse and it doesn't seem to be able to see the classes as I would expect
2011-05-21T08:02:47  <__mike> Am I doing something wrong ?
2011-05-21T08:05:11  <__mike> Never mind I just imported the whole trunk and added that to the buildpath
2011-05-21T08:07:04  <__mike> Are there any docs on using Selenium Grid with the current trunk ?
2011-05-21T08:08:38  <jarib> __mike: the grid implementation in trunk isn't documented yet, unfortunately
2011-05-21T08:09:03  <jarib> the authors do hang out here during the week though
2011-05-21T08:09:58  *** celm has joined #selenium
2011-05-21T08:10:59  <__mike> The current trunk of selenium grid uses WebDriver not SeleniumRC right ?
2011-05-21T08:11:07  <__mike> I mean it _can_ use WebDriver ?
2011-05-21T08:11:55  <jarib> yes, it supports both webdriver and rc
2011-05-21T08:13:15  <__mike> In case I'm not able to get in touch with the authors do you know generally what should be done to get it working ?
2011-05-21T08:13:52  <jarib> __mike: this thread has some info https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/selenium-developers/-xolBxbJsEQ
2011-05-21T08:13:53  <__mike> I understand a hub needs to run. Then machines register with this hub giving their configurations. Then the unit tests should connect to the hub

2011-05-21T08:14:23  <jarib> __mike: search the selenium-developers list for "grid" and "grid2"
2011-05-21T08:14:31  <__mike> Okay
2011-05-21T08:14:55  <jarib> the thread i linked shows how to build and run it

2011-05-21T08:16:04  <__mike> Okay
2011-05-21T08:16:46  <__mike> Is it expected that Grid 2 release will be at the same time as the next version of selenium 2 ?

2011-05-21T08:20:08  <jarib> __mike: yep
2011-05-21T08:21:00  <__mike> Awesome. Great. Just got it built, gonna give it a run now ; )

2011-05-21T08:28:30  <__mike> Do you know if I wanted to connect to localhost running as the hub how I would go about doing this ?
2011-05-21T08:28:54  <__mike> The same port can't be used of course since the hub is already running listening on that one
2011-05-21T08:37:59  <jarib> i have no idea
2011-05-21T08:38:04  <jarib> pass --port maybe?
2011-05-21T08:39:52  <__mike> haha yes sorry.. doing that now
2011-05-21T08:42:48  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-05-21T08:48:18  <__mike> I am now using "java -jar selenium-standalone.jar -role hub" for the hub and then "java -jar selenium-standalone.jar -role webdriver -port 12345 -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register"
2011-05-21T08:48:29  <__mike> http://localhost:4444/console gives a 404
2011-05-21T08:49:09  <__mike> But running the following Java code throws an exception : http://pastebin.com/8VxUH3vt
2011-05-21T08:50:27  <__mike> http://localhost:4444/ seems to just be the folder the .jar is running from
2011-05-21T08:59:55  <jarib> it's /grid/console, not /console
2011-05-21T09:01:34  <__mike> Oh ! Looks like it's registered : )]
2011-05-21T09:04:16  <__mike> Mmm so I wonder why it cannot find a matching configuration
