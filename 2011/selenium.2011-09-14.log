2011-09-14T02:18:25  <eranm> rhineshell, WebDriver is just an API. You may be able to export a recorded test to WebDriver's Java API and use that.
2011-09-14T02:18:57  * eranm recalls that last time he saw this question, somebody with actual knowledge of Selenium IDE answered it.
2011-09-14T02:22:13  <jarib> i think IDE supports webdriver exports somewhat at this point

2011-09-14T02:35:19  <krosenvold> The "fun" thing is that in BasicMouseInterfaceTest  this would happen because the browser is re-used between tests. One test double clicks and the next test starts with "get"

2011-09-14T06:03:20  <nirvdrum> Thanks for QAing it.  I know it's been kind of an annoyingly harsh road.
2011-09-14T06:03:54  <nirvdrum> It gets hard because freynaud doesn't use the RC protocol and I don't use the WebDriver one.  So we both make changes and hope it doesn't adversely impact the other :-P

That means that complex xpath expressions may break on some browsers."

2011-09-14T07:57:16  <jqp> i'm noticing a fair number of instances where xpath expressions that worked with selenium 1 don't work with webdriver (java, 2.6.0), e.g. http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2453.  does that note in the docs imply that these types of issues are lower priority?

2011-09-14T07:58:20  <jimevans> jqp: no, that xpath doesn't work presently. bear in mind that IE doesn't support XPath natively.
2011-09-14T07:58:34  <lord1234> oh wait ur in IE?
2011-09-14T07:58:38  <jimevans> we have to inject a javascript xpath engine to get xpath queries to work at all in IE.
2011-09-14T07:59:22  <jimevans> it's entirely likely that the javascript xpath engine we use has a bug in it that doesn't work with that particular xpath query.
2011-09-14T07:59:30  <jqp> jimevans: oh, i didn't realize IE doesn't natively support XPath.  is there a work-around if i want to be able to do this with InternetExplorerDriver?

2011-09-14T08:01:12  <jimevans> you could try a css selector. "span[name='foo']", but i don't know if that would work either.
2011-09-14T08:01:18  <lord1234> then check if the attribute exists for that element....
2011-09-14T08:01:49  <jqp> i'll try the css selector, then the filtering approach

2011-09-14T08:17:58  *** ammar01 has quit IRC
2011-09-14T08:18:11  <jimevans> Parabola: i'm not as well versed in the java bindings as with other languages, but getCookieNamed() should give you the cookie with the name you're looking for.
2011-09-14T08:18:23  <jimevans> calling getValue on the returned Cookie object should give you the value of the cookie.
2011-09-14T08:19:41  <Parabola> jimevans: how does a cookie have a value? i'm looking at this cookie right now theres a dozen different key:value pairs in it
2011-09-14T08:19:46  <jimevans> a Cookie represents the name-value pair in the browser's cookie string. getName() gives you the name, getValue() has the value.
2011-09-14T08:20:03  <Parabola> okay, sounds like i'm unclear on a few things hehe
2011-09-14T08:20:22  <jimevans> what the driver calls a cookie should probably technically be called a crumb. :)
2011-09-14T08:20:30  <Parabola> oo
2011-09-14T08:20:57  <Parabola> so getCookieNamed(String) doesn't want the actual "cookie" name, but a value within a cookie
2011-09-14T08:21:07  <Parabola> so, in that case, how do i tell it the cookie for the current domain, or is that automatic?
2011-09-14T08:21:08  <jimevans> but people tend to think of a "cookie" as *one* of the name value pairs returned when you examine a browser's cookie string.
2011-09-14T08:21:47  <jimevans> so what does your cookie string look like right now?
2011-09-14T08:22:12  <Parabola> so if i have a value pair named "food" with a value of "pear" getCookieNamed("food") would return "pear" ?
2011-09-14T08:23:43  <jimevans> we might be talking past each other a little, and i don't want to frustrate you.
2011-09-14T08:23:51  <jimevans> so what does your cookie string look like right now?

2011-09-14T09:03:36  <farlan> hmmm I'm not seeing it, the only thing I see is the element not found exception that gets thrown when the findBy method is called next
2011-09-14T09:03:55  <mltolun> hello, is there any way to run Grid2 to listen in a SSL port using command line params?
2011-09-14T09:06:22  <lukeis> farlan: ahh... accroding to the tests for implicitlyWait it just throws the not-found exception... WebDriverWait will throw a timeout
2011-09-14T09:07:06  <lukeis> mltolun: you can set grid to run on any port... making it run in an encrypted mode (like ssl) i don't believe is currently an option
2011-09-14T09:08:49  <farlan> thanks lukeis this is exactly what I was looking for

2011-09-14T12:02:07  <Nogem> updated jar to 2.6 - getting a click event that consistently doesn't click now
2011-09-14T12:05:07  <jqp> Nogem: similar to http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2458?
2011-09-14T12:07:01  <Nogem> with less abstraction in the click event, yeah
2011-09-14T12:07:20  <Nogem> the failing line for me is driver.findElement(By.linkText(Proj)).click();
2011-09-14T12:08:23  <Nogem> I can comment the ticket - I went from 2.4 and this line firing no issue to dead in 2.6, but this is FAR from the only click event in my current project. It's just the one that's constantly failing for some reason.
2011-09-14T12:10:24  <jqp> Nogem: have you tried By.partialLinkText(Proj)?
2011-09-14T12:12:16  *** AutomatedTester has quit IRC
2011-09-14T12:13:20  <Nogem> jqp: nope - I'll give that shot. What's the backend difference?
2011-09-14T12:14:45  <Nogem> let me rephrase that since it seems self descriptive
2011-09-14T12:15:52  *** mario-goulart has quit IRC
2011-09-14T12:15:56  *** mario-goulart has joined #selenium
2011-09-14T12:16:11  <jqp> i have zero knowledge of the implementation, but i imagine the difference could be that partialLinkText uses a regex, e.g. /.*Proj.*/.test(element), whereas linkText uses a stricter equivalence match, e.g. elementText.eq(Proj)
2011-09-14T12:16:11  <Nogem> is there a difference in handling the value from a variable? Going through my code to verify but it looks like my other click events have hard coded text in that field.
2011-09-14T12:16:28  <jqp> possibly

2011-09-14T12:18:39  *** jhegge1 has joined #selenium
2011-09-14T12:19:43  <jqp> anyone know how i could implement a webdriver-based port for selenium's isTextPresent(text) such that it would return false if the text value were contained in a hidden element, e.g. such that driver.isTextPresent("foo") returns false for <span style="display:none">foo</span>?
2011-09-14T12:20:33  *** jhegge has quit IRC
2011-09-14T12:20:42  <Nogem> partialLinkText also exploded
2011-09-14T12:20:43  <jqp> webdriver's lack of these types of convenience methods is a pain
2011-09-14T12:21:11  *** mrchess has joined #selenium
2011-09-14T12:21:20  <jqp> Nogem: can you reduce the problem down to a bare-bones example?
2011-09-14T12:21:59  <Nogem> yup - .click() with quoted text works, with variables doesn't work
2011-09-14T12:22:17  *** Ajay has quit IRC
2011-09-14T12:22:37  <DustinFay> dumb question on that: are you sure the variables are strings?
2011-09-14T12:25:08  <Nogem> yeah, same code worked with 2.4 jar
2011-09-14T12:25:38  <Nogem> and I System.out.println the value on the line above and below the click in question
2011-09-14T12:25:55  <Nogem> good check though
2011-09-14T12:26:24  <jqp> Nogem: which driver, FirefoxDriver?
2011-09-14T12:26:56  <Nogem> yeah
2011-09-14T12:30:24  <Nogem> would have included a stack trace in my ticket comment, but it's related to the timeout looking for the next element and not the click not happening
2011-09-14T12:30:33  <jqp> java, ruby, python?
2011-09-14T12:30:39  <Nogem> java
2011-09-14T12:30:59  <jqp> i can't reproduce the issue using FirefoxDriver and selenium 2.6.0
2011-09-14T12:31:41  <Nogem> give me half a tic - I'll get my system data cap from the stack traces
2011-09-14T12:32:33  <jqp> using this.driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.navigate().to("http://localhost/sample.html"); String text = "foo"; driver.findElement(By.linkText(text)).click();, the text passes with <html><body><a href="#">foo</a></body></html>

2011-09-14T15:02:42  <algard`> i tried searching it in the issue tracker but I can't think of any good keywords to use
2011-09-14T15:04:22  <lukeis> is it #1766  re-appearing?
2011-09-14T15:04:23  <selbot2_>  closed/fixed FirefoxWebElement#sendKeys("Cheese!") sends keys to URL bar with Firefox 4 - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1766 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium]
