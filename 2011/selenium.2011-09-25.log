2011-09-25T11:27:46  <Renacor> Can somebody point me at the right source file to look at to figure out http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2091
2011-09-25T11:28:06  *** bitwise_ has quit IRC
2011-09-25T11:34:38  <jarib> Renacor: what language binding are you using?
2011-09-25T11:34:45  <Renacor> jarib: php
2011-09-25T11:36:36  <jarib> Renacor: i think the problem is client side - the desired capabilities should include "platform" (e.g. "platform": "ANY")
2011-09-25T11:36:42  <jarib> though the server could definitely raise a better error
2011-09-25T11:36:53  <Renacor> jarib: let me try including that one sec
2011-09-25T11:40:55  <Renacor> jarib: platform does not seem to make a difference: http://pastebin.ca/2082810
2011-09-25T11:41:08  <jarib> interesting
2011-09-25T11:41:46  <Renacor> I take it not everyone has this problem??
2011-09-25T11:41:53  *** ian_mac has joined #selenium
2011-09-25T11:42:11  <jarib> right
2011-09-25T11:42:14  <jarib> here's what ruby sends:
2011-09-25T11:42:17  <jarib> {"desiredCapabilities":{"browserName":"firefox","version":"","platform":"ANY","javascriptEnabled":true,"cssSelectorsEnabled":true,"takesScreenshot":true,"nativeEvents":false,"rotatable":false}}
2011-09-25T11:42:37  <Renacor> weird thing is that I can continue sending commands, but things like finding elements by tag name won't return anything
2011-09-25T11:42:52  <Renacor> jarib: lemme try adding all that
2011-09-25T11:43:44  <jarib> odd
2011-09-25T11:44:29  <jarib> it works well from ruby
2011-09-25T11:44:34  <Renacor> this is the json I get back when trying to search after that exception for an element by tagname '{"sessionId":"1316976665486","status":0,"value":{"ELEMENT":"0"},"class":"org.openqa.selenium.remote.Response","hCode":22643639}' . "\0" . '' . "\0" . '' . "\0" . '' . "\0" . '' . "\0" . '' . "\0" . '' . "\0" . '' . "\0" . '' . "\0" . '' . "\0" . '' . "\0" . '' . "\0" . ''
2011-09-25T11:45:45  <Renacor> yeah same error when I have the above json for ruby
2011-09-25T11:45:50  <jarib> that JSON looks correct
2011-09-25T11:46:07  <jarib> what php client is this?
2011-09-25T11:46:30  <jarib> you may want to ask adam when he comes on, i know he's been working in php lately
2011-09-25T11:46:31  <Renacor> http://code.google.com/p/php-webdriver-bindings/source/checkout
2011-09-25T11:46:36  <jarib> :seen adamgoucher
2011-09-25T11:46:36  <selbot2> adamgoucher was last seen 1 day ago, quitting.
2011-09-25T11:47:50  <Renacor> {"desiredCapabilities":{"javascriptEnabled":true,"nativeEvents":false,"browserName":"firefox","version":"","platform":"ANY","cssSelectorsEnabled":true,"takesScreenshot":true,"rotatable":false}} <-- json I send
2011-09-25T11:48:53  <Renacor> which part of the source handles the capabilities request?
2011-09-25T11:51:17  <Renacor> java/server/src/org/openqa/grid/web/servlet/handler/RequestHandler.java ?
2011-09-25T11:51:34  <jarib> i don't know the server internals well
2011-09-25T11:52:03  <jarib> but following the stacktrace would be the way to go
2011-09-25T11:56:21  <Renacor> jarib: could you verify if the php webdriver works or does not work for you?
2011-09-25T11:57:07  <Renacor> also is the desiredCapabilities request supposed to be POST or GET?
2011-09-25T11:59:09  <jarib> i don't really know how to run php code
2011-09-25T11:59:32  <jarib> but the fact that several people have reported the problem indicates it's not entirely local to your env
2011-09-25T11:59:43  <jarib> :wiki jsonwireprotocol
2011-09-25T11:59:44  <selbot2> 1: JsonWireProtocol: A description of the protocol used by WebDriver to communicate with remote instances - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol
2011-09-25T12:00:10  <jarib> Renacor: the initial request is POST to /session with the desired capabilities
2011-09-25T12:00:27  <jarib> that should redirect to /session/:sessionId which will return the actualy capabilities
2011-09-25T12:00:30  <jarib> *actual
2011-09-25T12:00:49  <jarib> so POST -> redirect -> GET
2011-09-25T12:00:50  <Renacor> looking at http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#Actual_Capabilities
2011-09-25T12:01:06  <Renacor> i see

2011-09-25T12:13:06  <Renacor> jarib: when you used the ruby driver to test, did you connect to a local selenium server or a remote one?
2011-09-25T12:13:43  <jarib> local

2011-09-25T12:48:26  <jarib> on connect?

2011-09-25T13:22:47  <Renacor> if you get an element by tagname is that going to return only the first found or all of the anchor tags
