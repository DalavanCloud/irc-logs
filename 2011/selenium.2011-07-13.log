2011-07-13T02:17:40  <__mike> Hi Krishnan, I haven't ever used the Proxy Server stuff in RemoteWebDriver but have you taken a look at this post : http://groups.google.com/group/webdriver/browse_thread/thread/9af18b9b0706f74f/d37546c993c8ecbf?pli=1 ?
2011-07-13T02:18:47  <Krishnan> Thanks Mike.. The last post on that was me :) I still am stuck with this issue and not able to de-cipher how to proceed as well :(
2011-07-13T02:19:32  <Krishnan> because I only have the standalone 2.0.0 jar.. with no source code.. I am not able to set breakpoints also and try to debug more...
2011-07-13T02:20:41  <__mike> You can get hold of the sources here : http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/detail?name=selenium-server-2.0.0.zip&can=2&q=
2011-07-13T02:22:18  <Krishnan> so if remove my dependency on selenium-server-standalone-2.0.0.jar and instead depend on selenium-server-2.0.0.zip's contents I can proceed right Mike ?
2011-07-13T02:22:52  <__mike> If you open up the zip you can find the src jar which you can then attach to your current library
2011-07-13T02:23:17  <Krishnan> ok. Let me try that.. Thanks mike..

2011-07-13T03:34:35  <AutomatedTester> hey freynaud
2011-07-13T03:36:43  <AutomatedTester> eranm: whats the best way to debug the badCert/interface stuff for FirefoxDriver
2011-07-13T03:37:28  <freynaud> oh, I have that question too :)  the badcert stuff doesn't work for me for some reason
2011-07-13T03:37:53  <AutomatedTester> freynaud: i think I might have your solution
2011-07-13T03:37:57  <AutomatedTester> that reminds me
2011-07-13T03:38:05  * AutomatedTester opens up intellij
2011-07-13T03:38:07  <freynaud> i'm listening
2011-07-13T03:38:11  <eranm> AutomatedTester, have a look at the error console
2011-07-13T03:38:36  <AutomatedTester> eranm: I am looking at the console but thought you might be able to give me more info than that :)
2011-07-13T03:38:53  <AutomatedTester> the badCert stuff is breaking Fx6 support
2011-07-13T03:39:02  <AutomatedTester> again... :/
2011-07-13T03:39:39  <AutomatedTester> everytime I open up intellij I am reminded why I use VIM
2011-07-13T03:39:42  <eranm> have a look at badCertListener.js , to see what each message on the console from this component means
2011-07-13T03:39:46  <AutomatedTester> *waiting*
2011-07-13T03:40:13  <eranm> there's the wiki page, UntrustedSSLCertificates
2011-07-13T03:40:29  <AutomatedTester> :wiki UntrustedSSLCertificates
2011-07-13T03:40:30  <selbot2> 1: UntrustedSSLCertificates: The way WebDriver handles untrusted SSL certificates - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/UntrustedSSLCertificates
2011-07-13T03:40:52  <eranm> Most of the implementation is pretty straightforward
2011-07-13T03:40:52  <AutomatedTester> ahh
2011-07-13T03:40:56  <AutomatedTester> cool
2011-07-13T03:41:27  <eranm> the only non-trivial part is setting the override bits to match the exact violations the certificate generates
2011-07-13T03:41:54  <AutomatedTester> freynaud: I saw setAssumeUntrustedCertificateIssuer(bool) in the profile
2011-07-13T03:42:07  <AutomatedTester> I wonder if setting that to true in the profile might help
2011-07-13T03:42:15  <eranm> and one of the bits is something we cannot deduce - so we let users toggle this setAssumeUntrustedCerficateIssuer bit
2011-07-13T03:42:20  <freynaud> I don't understand the log in the console at all
2011-07-13T03:42:35  <freynaud> Failed to load XPCOM component: C:\DOCUME~1\freynaud\LOCA ....
2011-07-13T03:42:41  <eranm> That's the only user-servicable part in there
2011-07-13T03:42:53  <freynaud> I have 20 lines like that. Everything fails but the overrride certif error
2011-07-13T03:43:03  <freynaud> however everything works but the ssl stuff :)
2011-07-13T03:43:06  <eranm> freynaud, can you paste it somewhere?
2011-07-13T03:43:38  <AutomatedTester> eranm: in FxDriver the issue is when we try get the original service
2011-07-13T03:43:41  <AutomatedTester> for some issue
2011-07-13T03:43:44  <eranm> Perhaps the registration of the component should be done differently, that's towards the end of badCertListener.js
2011-07-13T03:45:21  <AutomatedTester> ahh, that looks old school

2011-07-13T03:48:59  <freynaud> i can bypass that by setting a profile with the exceptions, but it adds a lot of maintenance
2011-07-13T03:50:36  <eranm> freynaud, I agree, you shouldn't be doing that yourself

2011-07-13T03:51:59  <eranm> It seems like the service *is* registered (otherwise you wouldn't get the printouts from it)
2011-07-13T03:52:31  <cyfyrifilefe> Hello, doesn't Selenium IDE support https?
2011-07-13T03:53:51  <cyfyrifilefe> I am using the firefox plugin.
2011-07-13T03:55:30  <AutomatedTester> it should support HTTPS
2011-07-13T03:55:41  <AutomatedTester> make sure that your test suite doesnt change the baseURL
2011-07-13T03:57:30  <cyfyrifilefe> Opening the .suite-file I cannot find any baseURL.
2011-07-13T03:58:23  <AutomatedTester> cyfyrifilefe: have you looked at the top of the Addon when its open?
2011-07-13T03:59:42  <cyfyrifilefe> AutomatedTester: Ah, yes you are right, it changes the baseURL. But how does it know, if nothing is set in the .suite-file?
2011-07-13T04:00:12  <AutomatedTester> cyfyrifilefe: if nothing is set it defaults to what is in the addon
2011-07-13T04:00:46  <cyfyrifilefe> AutomatedTester: Ah, okay.
2011-07-13T04:00:59  <cyfyrifilefe> AutomatedTester: Thanks :)

2011-07-13T04:06:41  <adamgoucher> in tweetdeck
2011-07-13T04:07:21  <eranm> freynaud, it looks ok. But it's probably getting a NPE when trying to serialize the capabilities
2011-07-13T04:07:39  <eranm> If you don't modify the profile, just pass it as-is, does the same thing happen?
2011-07-13T04:08:04  <freynaud> same
2011-07-13T04:10:02  <freynaud> eranm: it's working fine with Remote
2011-07-13T04:10:53  <freynaud> eranm: so remote, passing a profile and having p.setAssumeUntrustedCertificateIssuer(true); gives me the same thing. untrusted page
2011-07-13T04:11:20  * AutomatedTester downloads Firefox source...
2011-07-13T04:12:25  <adamgoucher> didnt you spend most of the other week fetching that? or did you nuke it in a fit of 'bah! i wont need this' :)
2011-07-13T04:17:10  <jarib> freynaud: you should set it to false
2011-07-13T04:17:47  <jarib> freynaud: it's true by default. if you're using a valid certificate but under a different hostname (i.e. prod certificates in test envs), the fix is to set it to false

2011-07-13T05:23:12  <RossPatterson> Good $DAYPART, simonstewart (et al.).
2011-07-13T05:23:14  <simonstewart> I think that there's been some nice fixes in Grid
2011-07-13T05:23:24  <AutomatedTester> nothing that I know
2011-07-13T05:23:27  <simonstewart> k
2011-07-13T05:23:37  <simonstewart> I think that this should be an easy release, right?
2011-07-13T05:23:43  <simonstewart> Nothing major has shifted
2011-07-13T05:24:23  <AutomatedTester> there is #2037 that would be nice but we can't always replicate it :/

2011-07-13T05:30:28  <ian_mac_> should 444 be closed if hover is deprecated?

2011-07-13T05:31:21  <simonstewart> done
2011-07-13T05:33:47  <ian_mac_> and is moveto supposed to move the actual mouse cursor?
2011-07-13T05:33:56  <simonstewart> not the actual cursor
2011-07-13T05:34:21  <ian_mac_> ok
2011-07-13T05:34:38  <ian_mac_> I was working with it last night, and it seemed to cause the tooltip to appear
2011-07-13T05:34:49  <ian_mac_> but the actual cursor did not move.  So that is expected behaviour?
2011-07-13T05:36:33  <simonstewart> We fire the events at the browser
2011-07-13T05:36:37  <simonstewart> At the OS level
2011-07-13T05:36:43  <simonstewart> So I'd expect tool tips and hover events to fire
2011-07-13T05:37:06  <ian_mac_> that seems reasonable.  Thanks.
2011-07-13T05:37:12  <simonstewart> (that also explains why it can be tempremental if the actual mouse cursor is over the window)

2011-07-13T05:38:10  <ian_mac_> ok makes sense
2011-07-13T05:38:30  <ian_mac_> and the element id it is expecting is a number that is obtained from find element, right?

2011-07-13T08:25:12  <scampbell> ah...
2011-07-13T08:25:26  <scampbell> well it runs for quite a bit before it hits problems
2011-07-13T08:25:47  <scampbell> so im assuming this is some sort of cumulative effect so somehow the QA dev isnt clearing or resetting something
2011-07-13T08:26:11  <antlong> it might be adding more and more crap to the headers as it goes on, which might be a problem on our end
2011-07-13T08:26:32  <antlong> the hypothesis is dependent on what happens outside of selenium though
2011-07-13T08:26:53  <scampbell> right this has never been an issue outside of selenium
2011-07-13T08:27:00  <scampbell> that im aware of anyhow

2011-07-13T09:25:07  <kshep> jarib: I think it's a function of the rvm related dot stuff in the directory
2011-07-13T09:26:23  <iserko> geograman, are you running the selenium server? is it on the same computer is this script you're running? if so you could try fopen('http://127.0.0.1:4444/driver/?cmd=getNewBrowserSession&1=%2Afirefox&2=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fjb%2Ftest.php')
2011-07-13T09:27:08  <iserko> geograman, add selenium-server before driver too (missed it)
2011-07-13T09:27:46  <jarib> kshep: perhaps diff the output from `env` in the two dirs
2011-07-13T09:28:48  <kshep> yeah, that's what I did
2011-07-13T09:28:50  <jarib> Krishnan: i don't think that's possible for IE at the moment, without setting it up for the whole machine
2011-07-13T09:28:55  <jarib> jimevans might know ^
2011-07-13T09:29:41  <jarib> kshep: could also try making a copy of the app and get rid of all the rvm stuff, then see if it still fails
2011-07-13T09:29:51  <kshep> there's a bunch more rvm_* stuff set in the app directory
2011-07-13T09:29:51  <jarib> just to make sure rvm is the culprit
2011-07-13T09:30:06  <Krishnan> jarib : So I would have to on an offline basis configure the proxy server and port for a machine and then rely on that system setting to take effect on the remote machine is it ? Or have the IE browser on the remote machine configured to use the proxy server ?

2011-07-13T09:34:39  <Parabola> I'm failing to see how the selenium server receives the tests
2011-07-13T09:34:42  <Parabola> i'm reading this: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/05_selenium_rc.html#server-options
2011-07-13T09:34:48  <Parabola> and it just skips over it
2011-07-13T09:35:15  <Parabola> it goes from "the client commands are sent to the server" to how to run the server "java -jar"
2011-07-13T09:35:21  <Parabola> not to be rude, but thats not overly helpful
2011-07-13T09:35:52  <msturm> Ah, nice :) managed to get the Firefox profile stuff as hoped for..  I was thinking to difficult... you can just specify it on your remote WebDriver...
2011-07-13T09:36:35  <Parabola> and i guess a better question is, does this doc even apply to selenium 2/ webdriver
2011-07-13T09:37:08  <adamgoucher> is there a pseudo standardized way to do pydoc ish things for javascript?
2011-07-13T09:37:35  <jimevans> Parabola: The document you're referring to concentrates on the Selenium RC API. With the Selenium WebDriver API, things are a little different.
2011-07-13T09:37:59  <Parabola> jimevans: thank you for your response :)

2011-07-13T09:40:57  <jimevans> Before you answer
2011-07-13T09:41:02  <jimevans> let me explain my confusion.
2011-07-13T09:41:50  <jimevans> With the WebDriver API, the Selenium Server is no longer required. You can execute the tests using a browser on a non-local machine using RemoteWebDriver,
2011-07-13T09:41:53  <jarib> Krishnan: if it's possible to do cleanly, i don't see why not
2011-07-13T09:42:04  <jimevans> but the code will execute on the local machine.
2011-07-13T09:42:25  <Parabola> ooh
2011-07-13T09:42:36  <Parabola> so the server is pointless now
2011-07-13T09:42:53  <Parabola> so i can setup a VM and throw eclipse and maven on there

2011-07-13T09:43:18  <jimevans> Not pointless exactly. It does allow for some interesting scenarios, but yes, you can set up a VM with a Java environment, and Bob's your uncle.

2011-07-13T09:47:13  <adamgoucher> or better still; run them locally and then again on the server. (since it doesnt matter really if they run locally well or not)
2011-07-13T09:48:52  <Parabola> hmm
2011-07-13T09:48:55  <Krishnan> Parabola : A build server a.k.a a continuous integration server.. takes care of automatic code compilation (everytime a delivery happens) on an optional basis runs unit tests and performs post test operations such as deploying an artifact to some place etc.,
2011-07-13T09:49:19  <Parabola> so in this case, it would build the unit tests, and run them every X

2011-07-13T09:50:03  <tunabum> depends on what language the app and tests are written in
2011-07-13T09:50:14  <Parabola> forgive my ignorance, im reading the documentation top to bottom
2011-07-13T09:50:23  <Parabola> and i saw some examples in java that looks pretty simple
2011-07-13T09:50:24  <jimevans> Depends on the CI server, but most have plug-ins that allow you to run tests in various unit testing frameworks.
2011-07-13T09:50:32  <Parabola> good lord
2011-07-13T09:50:48  <Krishnan> and this is configurable to get done automatically without any intervention.. For instance we use Java for client side scripting in Selenium, the unit tests are kicked off by Maven, which relies on TestNG
2011-07-13T09:51:09  <Parabola> alright
2011-07-13T09:51:09  <tunabum> (with the surefire-plugin)
2011-07-13T09:51:22  <Parabola> so i realized this is a much bigger undertaking than i thought it was
2011-07-13T09:51:30  <Parabola> the biggest issue is my boss seems to think this is a basic client/server app
2011-07-13T09:51:33  <Parabola> that just runs a script
2011-07-13T09:51:38  <Krishnan> :)
2011-07-13T09:51:39  <Parabola> i tried to explain to him that it wasnt, but he doesnt get it
2011-07-13T09:51:58  <Parabola> he told me to "set the server up and then the devs can start writing tests for our site"
2011-07-13T09:52:04  <jimevans> I'm confused why developers can't run tests on their machines.
2011-07-13T09:52:08  <Parabola> which to me says "setup a VM and put eclipse and maven on it"
2011-07-13T09:52:16  <Parabola> but hes going to get pissy about it

2011-07-13T09:55:10  <Parabola> i think he googled this a while back before webdriver was around
2011-07-13T09:55:11  <Krishnan> Parabola : The way I see it you have couple of choices.. either you can tell your dev folks to run their tests local.. or u can facilitate the environment by setting up a CI server, setting up the hub env for the CI execution to work on and then hand over the environment to ur dev..
2011-07-13T09:55:13  <Parabola> and got the wrong idea

2011-07-13T09:58:24  <Parabola> good lord
2011-07-13T09:59:22  <tunabum> your dev's should really be the ones figuring this out and just requesting servers with X installed on it
2011-07-13T09:59:31  <Krishnan> hub environment = grid. The docs can explain more than what i could possibly do... but its like a centralised execution manager for ur remote executions.. the grid takes care of distribution of tests to different nodes based on what browser u are asking for etc.,
2011-07-13T10:00:23  <Krishnan> so the way executions happen is.. selenese commands are triggered from ur local desktop.. reach the grid.. grid finds a free remote node executes ur commands.. gets back the result.. sends it back to ur local machine :)
2011-07-13T10:00:33  <Parabola> tunabum: yeah
2011-07-13T10:00:53  <Parabola> this "quick task" has turned into quite a learning curve for me

2011-07-13T11:05:00  <jarib> thanks for digging into this
2011-07-13T11:05:15  <kshep> oh... it *is* mongoose... I was doing a search earlier for the response fields and all they kept returning was mongoose....
2011-07-13T11:05:18  <kshep> heh
2011-07-13T11:05:20  <jarib> haha
2011-07-13T11:05:35  <kshep> I kept thinking "well, that's not applicable... what does it have to do with rails."
2011-07-13T11:05:36  <jarib> the IE and Chrome drivers use mongoose under the hood
2011-07-13T11:05:38  <kshep> sigh
2011-07-13T11:05:53  <machuga> This is likely more of a PHPUnit question, but figured I'd ask: Any idea why I would not be able to locate/use PHPUnit_Extensions_SeleniumTestCase::assertLocationEquals with PHPUnit 3.5.14 and SeleniumTestCase 1.0.3?
2011-07-13T11:06:01  <jimevans> jarib: dunno. let me see.
2011-07-13T11:06:01  <kshep> so yeah... that 401 is mongoose's reply when you've got a .htpasswd file in the current directory.
2011-07-13T11:06:09  <jarib> yep
2011-07-13T11:06:26  <kshep> ok with you if I, like, don't follow up and file a ticket for that? ;-)

2011-07-13T11:10:12  <autojack> antlong: in our setup, after you pick the file it automatically uploads. but that didn't happen when I used the js browse field, etc.
2011-07-13T11:10:30  <antlong> you have to look at what javascript is being executed when you pic the file
2011-07-13T11:10:51  <autojack> antlong: in their examples, they have an 'Upload files' link which calls <a href="javascript:$('#file_upload').uploadifyUpload()">Upload Files</a>
2011-07-13T11:10:59  <autojack> I tried firing that on ours and it didn't do anything.
2011-07-13T11:11:18  <antlong> do you have 'Upload Files' on your page
2011-07-13T11:11:20  <autojack> antlong: when I looked at the Firebug js tab during an upload, I saw nothing.

2011-07-13T12:56:32  <jarib> i.e. does the div in question contain another element that fills the div
2011-07-13T12:56:46  <jarib> if so, that's the one a user would hit
2011-07-13T12:57:57  <elew> no luck...
2011-07-13T12:58:34  <elew> i tried the icon inside the div and still it doesn't work...
2011-07-13T12:58:55  <elew> plus, i'm pretty sure that the whole div is clickable
2011-07-13T12:59:19  <jarib> can you create a minimal example that will reproduce this?
2011-07-13T12:59:46  <jarib> bbl
2011-07-13T12:59:56  <elew> hmm, i don't think so
2011-07-13T13:00:29  <elew> identical lines of code work for me
2011-07-13T13:00:36  <elew> not sure why this one doesn't
2011-07-13T13:01:12  <elew> as a matter of fact, i think this line of code used to work...I'm starting to think this may be a bug with my system

2011-07-13T13:26:38  <antlong> Selenium::WebDriver is webdriver, Selenium::Client is se1
2011-07-13T13:27:06  <autojack> yeah so I found http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Options.html
2011-07-13T13:27:22  <antlong> ok it says all_cookies
2011-07-13T13:27:26  <autojack> yeah
2011-07-13T13:27:30  <autojack> just not sure how to call it.
2011-07-13T13:27:33  <autojack> driver.all_cookies?
2011-07-13T13:27:38  <autojack> or driver.Options.all_cookies?
2011-07-13T13:27:38  <antlong> probably

2011-07-13T13:29:49  <jimevans> http://http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Driver.html
2011-07-13T13:29:56  <antlong> isnt there some kind of dir() command in ruby
2011-07-13T13:30:00  <jimevans> er, http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Driver.html
2011-07-13T13:30:49  <autojack> that totally worked
2011-07-13T13:31:09  <autojack> that is not an aspect of Ruby I'm familiar with. I don't understand what manage is. a reference to Options?
2011-07-13T13:31:13  <jimevans> the WebDriver API has some methods that are a "fluent" interface.
2011-07-13T13:31:17  <autojack> just returns Options.
2011-07-13T13:31:39  <antlong> @manage ||= WebDriver::Options.new(bridge)
2011-07-13T13:31:56  <jimevans> (which I hate, but I can't talk anybody into changing it)
2011-07-13T13:32:16  <antlong> eh it kind of makes a little sense
2011-07-13T13:32:21  <jimevans> It lets you write things like driver.switch_to.frame(frame_id)
2011-07-13T13:32:29  <antlong> all the options under manage are configurable
2011-07-13T13:32:34  *** csanchez has quit IRC

2011-07-13T13:34:37  <jimevans> the "fluent" methods read nicely, but they're regrettably inconsistent with the rest of the API.

2011-07-13T14:12:57  <jarib> would it be possible to send the mongoose people a patch that makes it configurable?
2011-07-13T14:13:11  <jarib> it's all kinds of insane that it's not
2011-07-13T14:13:35  <jimevans> I suppose. I'll need to bring it up on their mailing list (which I'm not currently subscribed to).
2011-07-13T14:14:22  <jimevans> but I'll get to it sometime soon.
2011-07-13T14:14:57  <jarib> i'd just file a bug :)
2011-07-13T14:15:32  <jimevans> yeah, but I hate it when people do that in our project, so I'll do unto others...
2011-07-13T14:16:03  <jarib> hehe
2011-07-13T14:17:16  <jarib> if i know you, the issue would probably be so well-written that you wouldn't have had a problem with it in our project :)
2011-07-13T14:17:17  <ian_mac_> you don't like people filing bugs?
2011-07-13T14:17:39  <ian_mac_> ah poor issue descriptions
2011-07-13T14:17:56  <jimevans> I love people filing bugs. I don't like people filing bugs as the first thing they do when the project doesn't work exactly the way they want it to, whether it's supposed to work that way or not.
2011-07-13T14:18:19  <jimevans> without further thought or research into the matter.
2011-07-13T14:18:30  <jimevans> happens far more often in selenium than i'd like.

2011-07-13T19:19:37  <jarib> patrick99e99: that's not something i can run though
2011-07-13T19:20:06  <jarib> and all the CSS and JS may very well be the cause of the problem
2011-07-13T19:21:30  <jarib> so without having access to either the full app or a reduced example, there's not much i can do
