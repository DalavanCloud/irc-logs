2011-06-14T05:13:44  <jrock20041> The connection is untrusted
2011-06-14T05:14:09  <jrock20041> If I manually test my script it works and error does not come up
2011-06-14T05:14:34  <jrock20041> I think what is happening is when the automation script gets kicked off it is not using my default profile like it should
2011-06-14T05:14:48  <jrock20041> My default profile has the certificate saved
2011-06-14T05:14:53  *** jimevans has joined #selenium
2011-06-14T05:17:30  <jarib> jrock20041: using your default profile shouldn't be necessary
2011-06-14T05:18:01  <jarib> and even if you do, you need to turn off webdriver's SSL handling for firefox to see the certificates installed in the profile
2011-06-14T05:18:16  <jarib> otherwise webdriver will say "i'll handle this" and just ignore your certs
2011-06-14T05:18:43  <jarib> but really, it should work without any manual tampering with profiles
2011-06-14T05:18:52  <jarib> jrock20041: could you take a screenshot of the error?
2011-06-14T05:19:01  <jrock20041> So I should just let it create its own profile then?

2011-06-14T05:42:59  <jarib> otherwise, no
2011-06-14T05:43:43  <jarib> if you want to manage certificates manually in your profile, you can setAcceptUntrustedCertificates(false) to disable webdriver's SSL handling altogether
2011-06-14T05:44:57  <jrock20041> jarib: ah so when that is set to true you are telling web driver to handle the extenstions

2011-06-14T07:02:19  <simonstewart> convert from png bytes?
2011-06-14T07:02:28  <simonstewart> Isn't that a duplicate of "bytes"?
2011-06-14T07:03:17  <Stuk> it accepts bytes as the input format, which can then be converted to any of the others
2011-06-14T07:03:41  <Stuk> we get bytes back from Opera, with the current OutputType we'd have to convert from that to base64, then probably back again for BYTE and FILE types
2011-06-14T07:04:12  <Stuk> this way OutputType can accept bytes as input, as well as base64
2011-06-14T07:04:13  <simonstewart> (firing up idea)
2011-06-14T07:05:56  <simonstewart> makes sense

2011-06-14T07:17:37  <jimevans> so if your physical cursor is over the browser window, ie recognizes that as the position.

2011-06-14T07:17:56  <simonstewart> We can shove the mouse cursor to the top right of the screen
2011-06-14T07:18:14  <jimevans> likewise, if it's not, a hover will work, but only for about .5 seconds, until ie realizes that the cursor is *not* over the browser window, and resets.
2011-06-14T07:18:26  <simonstewart> Perkele
2011-06-14T07:18:47  <simonstewart> We can offer to shove the users cursor out the way, but there's not much else we can do
2011-06-14T07:19:14  <jimevans> i feel like taking a drill bit to my temple. in the long run, it'd be less painful, and might actually accomplish something.

2011-06-14T07:52:25  <lisak> guys how does WebElement id relate to javascript nodes ?
2011-06-14T07:53:30  <lisak> how can I get the id via javascript
2011-06-14T07:54:11  <lisak> I'm not sure in which cases I can't use the same WebElement instance / id
2011-06-14T07:54:14  <jimevans> lisak: why do you need the id?
2011-06-14T07:54:27  <lisak> because the js Node doesn't exist anymore
2011-06-14T07:54:44  <jarib> why would getting the id via js help?
2011-06-14T07:54:58  <lisak> I just want to know what it represents
2011-06-14T07:55:24  <jarib> how does that help you?
2011-06-14T07:55:31  <jimevans> it's an opaque string that refers to a specific element. if the element isn't valid anymore, the id won't help you get it back.
2011-06-14T07:55:42  <lisak> if I create a JS node
2011-06-14T07:55:47  <lisak> append it as a child
2011-06-14T07:55:49  <lisak> remove it
2011-06-14T07:56:16  <lisak> then append it again ... the id is the same ... so that the same JS node instance always has the same id ?
2011-06-14T07:56:22  <jarib> no
2011-06-14T07:56:28  <jarib> oh
2011-06-14T07:56:37  <jarib> actually, i'm not sure
2011-06-14T07:56:40  <jarib> but it's easy to find out
2011-06-14T07:56:58  <lisak> but it is easier to know what does it represent
2011-06-14T07:57:18  <lisak> it can work for one case but not for another
2011-06-14T07:57:46  <jarib> i'm not sure what you mean
2011-06-14T07:59:46  <lisak> there must be somebody that knows how it works .... if the id represents an xpath, so that Node removing and appending on the same place results in the same ID
2011-06-14T07:59:56  <jarib> it doesn't represent an xpath
2011-06-14T08:00:03  <jarib> it represents the element instance
2011-06-14T08:00:13  <lisak> on the client side
2011-06-14T08:00:18  <jarib> on both sides.
2011-06-14T08:00:35  <lisak> I don't think so
2011-06-14T08:00:40  <jarib> heh
2011-06-14T08:00:44  <jarib> ok :)
2011-06-14T08:00:52  <lisak> look WebElement object doesn't have any state
2011-06-14T08:00:55  <lisak> it's just a pointer
2011-06-14T08:00:57  <jarib> yes
2011-06-14T08:01:01  <lisak> the id itseld
2011-06-14T08:01:04  <jarib> true
2011-06-14T08:01:21  <lisak> so that it represents something on the browser side :)
2011-06-14T08:01:41  <jarib> yes
2011-06-14T08:01:48  <jarib> which is why i said "on both sides"
2011-06-14T08:02:28  <lisak> the existence of it depends only on the browser side ...and now I need to know, what is it that the id represent ... in JS terms
2011-06-14T08:02:56  <jarib> it's just an UUID for that node
2011-06-14T08:03:35  <jarib> it's not an xpath - but if you remove and re-add the same *element instance*, the reference should work
2011-06-14T08:03:59  <jarib> if you remove the instance from the DOM, but it's still alive, you'll see an "element is no longer attached to the DOM" error
2011-06-14T08:04:05  <lisak> yeah that's what I meant, the node instance keeps the same ID
2011-06-14T08:04:10  <jarib> yes
2011-06-14T08:04:14  <lisak> I wasn't aware of any uuid in javascript
2011-06-14T08:04:21  <jarib> it's not JS, it's in our code
2011-06-14T08:04:25  <jarib> we keep a cache of UUID -> element
2011-06-14T08:07:51  <lisak> but then here we go again, what is element ....  var node1 = document.createElement('a');  ...if I append, remove and append again the same node1 instance
2011-06-14T08:07:56  <lisak> it has the same id
2011-06-14T08:08:14  <lisak> no matter what I do with it in browser
2011-06-14T08:08:14  <jarib> let me check real quick
2011-06-14T08:09:14  <jarib> yeah, that's true
2011-06-14T08:09:29  <lisak> even if you append it to a different node ?
2011-06-14T08:10:02  <jarib> let's see
2011-06-14T08:11:06  <jarib> yes, that works
2011-06-14T08:13:16  <lisak> great, thanks jarib ... I don't have environment for trying this now
2011-06-14T08:14:10  <jarib> the main insight here is that if you remove the node, and add a new node with the exact same characteristics in the exact same position, it's *not* the same id
2011-06-14T08:14:20  <jarib> it has to be the same element instance

2011-06-14T08:56:46  <lisak> monk13, sometimes you can kill both with selenium, if the app is UI driven ... but usually it is more complicated than that and people write unit tests for everything in the process of entire development ... if something breaks down there, failed selenium tests don't tell much, but DAO layer tests do

I was thinking i export my test case from Firefox's Selenium plugin into Java (Junit). and i use whatever database unit system to test a column populated after 'selenium.waitForPageToLoad("30000");' for example when i clickAndWait-ed a button.

2011-06-14T09:02:07  <monk13> ... but like the one problem i see is Selenium doesn't know the quiz_id, so not sure the JUnit test would know what row to get to assert against.
2011-06-14T09:03:01  <monk13> yeh, seems like can't mix anyway hehe. but like the status of the quiz changes throughout taking the quiz. thats what i want to check for in the databse as Selenium goes through the quiz.
2011-06-14T09:03:48  <lisak> this is done by pure unit testing, you just have to simulate  the actions of selenium programatically
2011-06-14T09:06:01  <lisak> I don't say you shouldn't do it, but I definitely wouldn't run selenium and test for UI and database state at the same time...though it would work, why not

2011-06-14T10:14:23  <simonstewart> Short answer: IE is pants and we value consistency

2011-06-14T10:15:00  <RossPatterson> "is pants"???
2011-06-14T10:15:10  <simonstewart> "is pants" == "crap"
2011-06-14T10:15:25  <simonstewart> But without the strong negative connotations

2011-06-14T17:12:46  <Owner_> If I'm using FirefoxDriver in Java, how do I wait for an element to be present? Should I use Wait?
2011-06-14T17:13:13  <Owner_> And should I use DefaultSelenium?

2011-06-14T18:11:49  <ner0x> http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-core/1.0/reference.html   Would this be the newest reference?
2011-06-14T18:12:29  <jarib> ner0x: :apidocs
2011-06-14T18:12:29  <selbot2> http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/index.html (java), http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/index.html (ruby)
2011-06-14T18:14:18  <ner0x> And for perl?
2011-06-14T18:15:25  <jarib> ner0x: there are no perl bindings maintained in the selenium source tree
2011-06-14T18:15:41  <jarib> so you'll have to look where you found the bindings.
2011-06-14T18:15:49  <ner0x> Official perl binding, I believe.
2011-06-14T18:15:54  <ner0x> Ah, I found them!
2011-06-14T18:16:02  <jarib> there are no official perl bindings
2011-06-14T18:16:09  <ner0x> Oh.
2011-06-14T18:16:25  <ner0x> I would assume the ones on cpan are the closest thing to it. Why doesn't perl have official bindings?
2011-06-14T18:17:07  <jarib> not sure
2011-06-14T18:17:36  <jarib> probably no one stepped up
2011-06-14T18:18:55  <ner0x> Hm.. Interesting.
2011-06-14T18:18:58  <ner0x> If I knew more, I would. :-/
2011-06-14T18:19:04  <jarib> as in "i want to maintain this" as opposed to "here's a bunch of code"
2011-06-14T18:19:25  <ner0x> What is involved in maintaining?
2011-06-14T18:19:34  *** kromped_ has quit IRC
2011-06-14T18:20:58  <jarib> ner0x: mostly just keeping up with changes
2011-06-14T18:21:11  <ner0x> Define "Keeping up with changes"
2011-06-14T18:22:01  <jarib> we're gearing up for the 2.0 release, things are changing quickly
2011-06-14T18:22:45  <jarib> language bindings need to keep up with changes in the drivers
2011-06-14T18:24:48  <jarib> ner0x: searching for "perl" on the selenium-developers list is probably a good idea
2011-06-14T18:25:25  <ner0x> Hm... That makes sense.
2011-06-14T18:25:41  <jarib> bedtime here, have fun :)
2011-06-14T18:25:46  <ner0x> $sel->wait_for_element_present('/span[@id="error-key"]/label[@html="Key incorrect."]');  Any idea how to get the value of label?
