2011-03-24T06:33:21  <jimevans> shoot
2011-03-24T06:33:35  <AutomatedTester> i implemented my alert tests for IE
2011-03-24T06:33:40  <jimevans> ok.
2011-03-24T06:33:40  <AutomatedTester> and am getting failures
2011-03-24T06:33:47  <AutomatedTester> IE8 on Win7
2011-03-24T06:33:53  <jimevans> alright.
2011-03-24T06:34:02  <AutomatedTester> error is they cant find the alert
2011-03-24T06:34:16  <AutomatedTester> these pass on Firefox
2011-03-24T06:34:17  <jimevans> are your tests comparable to the Java or .NET tests?

2011-03-24T06:34:26  <AutomatedTester> i *think*
2011-03-24T06:36:06  <jimevans> ok was just checking that the java and .net tests are equivalent (they are).
2011-03-24T06:36:25  <AutomatedTester> i have the same as the Java tests
2011-03-24T06:36:29  <jimevans> is it all tests or just one or two?
2011-03-24T06:37:39  <jimevans> because the tests that use prompt() require an ie setting to be tweaked (ie blocks prompt() dialogs by default)
2011-03-24T06:38:01  <AutomatedTester> its 3 tests

2011-03-24T07:20:10  <jarib> just for 1.9

2011-03-24T07:24:40  <jarib> hopefully your editor has a setting for BOM
2011-03-24T07:24:45  <jarib> for UTF-8, it shouldn't be added

2011-03-24T11:16:24  <jimevans> most of the chrome driver work has been put on hold waiting for the chromium-supplied chromedriver to land.
2011-03-24T11:17:02  <antlong> yeah i suppose i could switch. unfortunately, gwt runs best on chrome, (everything is JS)
2011-03-24T11:18:12  <jimevans> the alternative is really digging into the chrome extension code, but in my opinion, you're going to see only marginal, short-term benefit from that, mostly because the new driver is imminent
2011-03-24T11:18:48  <jimevans> or so i keep hearing from everyone.
2011-03-24T11:18:55  <antlong> yeah, i dont think it would make much of a difference, except for my own use

2011-03-24T11:23:55  <antlong> AutomatedTester, heh
2011-03-24T11:24:04  <AutomatedTester> thats why the current chromedriver tests dont run frames tests

2011-03-24T11:27:27  <AutomatedTester> so is it a nested frame
2011-03-24T11:28:37  <AutomatedTester> if so you might need to do a few switch_to_frame calls as you go through them

2011-03-24T11:30:27  <antlong> x-auto-36 is the id of the frame

2011-03-24T12:22:48  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: mind having a look at the last comment by me in #1451

2011-03-24T12:23:27  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: yeah, that's exactly right.
2011-03-24T12:23:45  <amirmia> antlong:http://pastebin.com/uhhdY3VV
2011-03-24T12:23:49  <jimevans> you've got to switch_to_default_content() in between.
2011-03-24T12:24:07  <antlong> spot on, AutomatedTester, atleast in that case
2011-03-24T12:24:28  <antlong> however :D
2011-03-24T12:24:31  <amirmia> I have found the element, so I do not have trouble searching for it
2011-03-24T12:24:37  <antlong> oh crud wait
2011-03-24T12:24:43  <antlong> indices start at 1, right?
2011-03-24T12:24:57  <jimevans> antlong: depends on the language.
2011-03-24T12:25:10  <antlong> in python they start at 0, but i think with frames it should be 1
2011-03-24T12:25:32  <antlong> wow im wrong there
2011-03-24T12:25:35  <antlong> ok it works perfectly
2011-03-24T12:25:36  <jimevans> why? in javascript, they start at 0.
2011-03-24T12:25:41  <amirmia> dd = driver.find_element(:name, 'outsink')
2011-03-24T12:25:56  <antlong> jimevans, in firebug, if you do //iframe[1] it seems like it gets the first one
2011-03-24T12:26:02  <amirmia> and dd.text gives me both the options..
2011-03-24T12:27:22  <amirmia> dd.click() works too :)
2011-03-24T12:27:25  <antlong> AutomatedTester, im going to send you a link to the actual case that blows up for me
2011-03-24T12:28:59  <AutomatedTester> cool
2011-03-24T12:29:07  <AutomatedTester> antlong: so you'll close that issue then?
2011-03-24T12:29:18  <amirmia> I am beggining to regret choosing ruby bindings.. not sure it it is mature.. selecting a dropdiwn is pretty basic
2011-03-24T12:30:10  <amirmia> any rubyist here?
2011-03-24T12:30:12  <carze> anyone ever run into a LOGGER not defined error using the python bindings?
2011-03-24T12:31:41  <antlong> carze, no but if you look at the traceback it will tell you what line its being called at, and you can comment it out if you dont want to log
2011-03-24T12:32:24  <amirmia> antlong: you asked for the code.. any ideas?
2011-03-24T12:32:34  <amirmia> pretty please
2011-03-24T12:32:59  <antlong> amirmia, whats the problem again?
2011-03-24T12:33:58  <amirmia> How do I select an option in the dropdown. i want to select the second value
2011-03-24T12:34:14  <antlong> use an indice
2011-03-24T12:34:17  <amirmia> using ruby

2011-03-24T12:34:46  <antlong> this is really more of a #ruby issue though ;) the ruby bindings are very well written.
2011-03-24T12:35:05  <jimevans> amirmia: sounds like you want (warning: untested code) dd.find_element(:xpath, ".//option[1]").select()
2011-03-24T12:35:34  <jimevans> or similar.
2011-03-24T12:35:38  <amirmia> jimevans: ahh.. that sounds like it
2011-03-24T12:35:52  <jimevans> find the option element you want, call select() on it.
2011-03-24T12:36:10  <amirmia> well .. I can find the element with no problems.
2011-03-24T12:36:37  <amirmia> it is stored in dd. So dd.select() will select which one?
2011-03-24T12:36:46  <jimevans> true, but remember, you need the <option> element, not the <select> element.
2011-03-24T12:37:30  <jimevans> you've found the <select> element, and stored it in dd. you need to find the <option> element you want to select, then call select() on it.

2011-03-24T14:29:04  <adamgoucher> my xpath is pretty good :P
2011-03-24T14:30:10  <davehunt> There ya go then :D
2011-03-24T14:38:00  <santiycr> @adamgoucher: I've seen single actions taking over 30 seconds when using xpath turn into <1sec using css
2011-03-24T14:38:32  <santiycr> I think the combination of // and contains is the main cause of slowness
2011-03-24T14:39:53  <adamgoucher> ya. i used contains a lot. my suspicion too is that there is a specific case that is nefarious. just need to care enough to do the timing and deubggin

2011-03-24T15:51:32  <ivog> hey all,
2011-03-24T15:51:59  <ivog> is it expected right now that the firefox suite fails when running the build with go on win7?
2011-03-24T15:53:03  <andytinkham> ivog: I'm not a developer, nor have I ever built selenium, but there was some talk within the last week about the firefox suite having a failure
2011-03-24T15:53:17  <andytinkham> xirkus: Sorry, don't know
2011-03-24T15:53:31  <ivog> ok thx
2011-03-24T15:54:20  <ivog> i'm trying to make a build to have a look at what grid 2.0 code is working allready...
2011-03-24T15:54:24  <andytinkham> ivog: It was testShouldAllowUsersTOHoverOverElements with an unrecognized POST command
2011-03-24T15:54:35  <andytinkham> (that was discussed previously)
2011-03-24T15:54:48  <ivog> hmm ok
2011-03-24T15:55:15  <andytinkham> And I guess it was more like a week and a half ago when I saw it mentioned
2011-03-24T15:55:31  <ivog> i couldn't tell from the buildlogging which test actually fails, im just getting started...
2011-03-24T15:56:09  <andytinkham> ivog: You're further along than I am with building the code :)
2011-03-24T15:58:12  <ivog> you're also trying to get the build working?
2011-03-24T15:58:45  <andytinkham> No, I'm just using the pre-built ruby gem
2011-03-24T15:58:56  <ivog> ah ok

2011-03-24T16:06:11  <andytinkham> Will be (well, technically I'm developing tests for windows/os x/ios and hopefully they'll run on all 3). I've done a little bit of making sure that I could get a test started, but I hit a bug in the iPhone driver where links/buttons couldn't be clicked so I couldn't log into my app
