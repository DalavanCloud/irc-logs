2011-04-23T06:44:48  <ygerasimov> hi everyone
2011-04-23T06:45:14  <ygerasimov> is there possibility in webdriver to start session of chrome with additional parameters?
2011-04-23T06:45:47  <ygerasimov> what I want to pass is string of user agent
2011-04-23T06:45:58  <ygerasimov> like  --user-agent="_custom string_"
2011-04-23T06:53:09  <ygerasimov> hi jarib. can you assist?
2011-04-23T07:04:47  <ivog> ygerasimov: so u want to change the request headers?
2011-04-23T07:05:31  <ivog> maybe you could have a look at http://blog.dynatrace.com/2009/08/04/get-more-out-of-functional-web-testing-how-to-correlate-test-reports-with-server-side-log-information/ it describes using fiddler as a proxy for changing request headers.
2011-04-23T07:05:36  <ygerasimov> ivog, yes I need to change that
2011-04-23T07:06:11  <ivog> i'm not sure but i dont think selenium supports changing request headers by itself
2011-04-23T07:06:33  <ygerasimov> I managed to change user agent header for firefox via webdriver
2011-04-23T07:06:52  <ygerasimov> for chrome it might be even easier as we just need to supply additional parameter
2011-04-23T07:07:07  <ygerasimov> ivog, thanks for the link I will read it
2011-04-23T07:07:07  <ivog> oh ok, then I guess i'm wrong
2011-04-23T07:09:33  <ygerasimov> ivog, so this article explains how to put proxy that changes headers, right?
2011-04-23T07:13:05  <ivog> right, i must say i haven't actually tried this myself
2011-04-23T07:13:55  <ivog> but it looks like it should be helpfull if you want to sent different requestheaders to your webserver
2011-04-23T07:14:09  *** wsmoak_ has quit IRC
2011-04-23T07:14:58  <ygerasimov> ivog, well yes, but I am trying to find more native way that will be platform independant
2011-04-23T07:15:09  *** Fyrespray has quit IRC
2011-04-23T07:15:36  <ivog> if you're able to do it in firefox maybe it's possible in chrome as well
2011-04-23T07:16:28  <ivog> the chrome driver is being rewritten right now, i guess it's done, maybe the new version of the driver supports it I don't know
2011-04-23T07:16:55  <ygerasimov> that would be great!
2011-04-23T07:17:04  <ygerasimov> anyhow thank you very much for the tip
2011-04-23T07:17:35  <ivog> are you working with the new driver allready?
2011-04-23T07:18:04  *** Fyrespray has joined #selenium
2011-04-23T07:19:17  <jarib> ygerasimov: the new driver does not support it (at least not yet)
2011-04-23T07:19:42  <jarib> you may be able to hack it into the old one by digging into the code, but there's no public API to do it AFAIK
2011-04-23T07:20:31  <ygerasimov> jarib, alright
2011-04-23T07:20:40  <ygerasimov> I will try to take a look
2011-04-23T07:21:54  <ygerasimov> it would be very nice feature to pass additional parameters to chrome when it starts
2011-04-23T07:22:17  <ygerasimov> similar way as we can send profile data to firefox

A node almost always re-registers as a result of a corrective action to a catastrophic event so it's safer to assume the session is dead and let the client sort it out than it is to assume the client can just resume working with the session. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12064
