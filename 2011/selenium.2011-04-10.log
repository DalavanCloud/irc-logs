2011-04-10T14:20:52  <mattp_> all webDriver language bindings communicate with the driver through the wire protocol (through REST), correct?
2011-04-10T14:22:54  <jarib> mattp_: yep
2011-04-10T14:27:40  <mattp_> jarib: cool. I want to write perl bindings for WebDriver, I've just been reading the ruby/python source
2011-04-10T14:28:05  <jarib> cool
2011-04-10T14:28:15  <jarib> i think someone did start on that
2011-04-10T14:28:18  <jarib> (or was that you?)
2011-04-10T14:29:01  <jarib> i think it's been mentioned on the selenium-dev list
2011-04-10T14:29:44  <mattp_> really? hm. I got in touch with the current WWW::Selenium perl maintainer, he said he had no intentino of working on the webdriver impl
2011-04-10T14:30:33  <jarib> https://github.com/aivaturi/Selenium-Remote-Driver
2011-04-10T14:32:37  <mattp_> interesting
2011-04-10T14:33:38  <mattp_> hasn't been touched in a few months
2011-04-10T14:35:31  <jarib> yep, might need an update to work with a trunk server
2011-04-10T14:38:15  <mattp_> might still write my own, was going to mooseify and possibly use Net::Spore. I guess it doesn't matter to you guys since perl wouldn't fall under the 'officially supported languages' list?
2011-04-10T14:40:53  <jarib> right
2011-04-10T14:41:14  <jarib> though if some bindings are actively maintained the chances of them becoming official increases
2011-04-10T14:41:55  <jarib> just don't want a situation where someone does a big code dump and then disappears, leaving a part of the tree unmaintained
2011-04-10T14:42:16  <jarib> (which the selenium project has had happen in the past)
2011-04-10T14:43:17  <mattp_> thats understandable

2011-04-10T14:59:14  <jarib> yes
2011-04-10T14:59:33  <jarib> and you?
2011-04-10T14:59:54  <AutomatedTester> still in MV
2011-04-10T15:00:00  <AutomatedTester> till Wednesday
2011-04-10T15:00:11  <jarib> nice
2011-04-10T15:00:23  <AutomatedTester> but have a cold :(
2011-04-10T15:00:38  <jarib> ugh
2011-04-10T15:01:08  <jarib> hope you're better before flying back
2011-04-10T15:01:17  <jarib> no fun being on an airplane with a cold
2011-04-10T15:01:37  <AutomatedTester> i know
2011-04-10T15:02:01  <jarib> though i'm sure you can get all kinds of drugs to help with that in the US :)
2011-04-10T15:02:18  <ahfeel_> hello guys :)
2011-04-10T15:02:33  <AutomatedTester> hey ahfeel_
2011-04-10T15:02:43  <jarib> yo!
2011-04-10T15:03:08  <ahfeel_> did any of you ever heard of any try to detect graphical breakage using screenshot comparison after selenium tests for example ?
2011-04-10T15:03:30  <jarib> yes
2011-04-10T15:03:37  <ahfeel_> oh rly ? cool
2011-04-10T15:03:38  <jarib> check out michael tamm's talk from gtac 2009
2011-04-10T15:03:56  <ahfeel_> I will ! thanks !
2011-04-10T15:04:18  <AutomatedTester> its an amazing talk
2011-04-10T15:04:49  <jarib> also, i know at least opera does some cool things where they manually verify a screenshot, hash it and then does auto-comparisons against that
2011-04-10T15:05:40  <jarib> but they do screenshots of specific elements, which isn't in selenium atm
2011-04-10T15:06:20  <jarib> ok, feeling sleepy, will use the opportunity :)
2011-04-10T15:06:21  <jarib> ttyl
2011-04-10T15:06:30  <ahfeel_> well, we're thinking of taking screenshot of each functionality and do basic viewport binary comparison, and warn to check manually the screenshot if there's any change to ensure it's not broken
2011-04-10T15:06:41  <ahfeel_> g'night ! :)
2011-04-10T15:14:51  *** esteele|away is now known as esteele
2011-04-10T15:24:38  <charleyb> yeah, opera guys do it with watir and pull out certain screenshots to manually verify
2011-04-10T15:25:38  <foobarbaz> is the source i get with get_page_source (python bindings for selenium 2) the original source or the current dom state?
2011-04-10T15:26:38  <AutomatedTester> foobarbaz: the current state at the time of the call
2011-04-10T15:29:54  <foobarbaz> AutomatedTester: ah perfect thanks!

2011-04-10T15:36:33  <charleyb> yep, we do too
2011-04-10T15:37:01  <AutomatedTester> but thanks to the fact that I am holed up in the hotel with a cold I should be able to clean it up a bit
2011-04-10T15:37:04  <charleyb> i want to do a bugmash day soon
2011-04-10T15:37:21  <AutomatedTester> we do it over a week
2011-04-10T15:37:24  <charleyb> would love pointers if you've done it before
2011-04-10T15:37:39  <charleyb> ah, was thinking a weekend, that might make more sense

2011-04-10T15:40:41  <charleyb> i know it's not python :)
2011-04-10T15:40:50  <charleyb> for the bug mash or other issues
2011-04-10T15:40:52  <AutomatedTester> i can help out where possible
2011-04-10T15:41:08  * AutomatedTester has worked on the core stuff too
2011-04-10T15:41:14  <charleyb> exactly
2011-04-10T15:41:18  <AutomatedTester> the bits that watir-webdriver uses
2011-04-10T15:41:29  <charleyb> fair enough
2011-04-10T15:41:51  <AutomatedTester> i dont mind helping
2011-04-10T15:42:04  <charleyb> it's ruby
2011-04-10T15:42:12  <AutomatedTester> it wont be as much as I help here but will give it a bash
2011-04-10T15:42:44  <charleyb> you know, japanese mormon, developed it in 1995
2011-04-10T15:43:09  <charleyb> we don't need help with bash

2011-04-10T15:45:33  <charleyb> i'm excited to work together
2011-04-10T15:51:34  <AutomatedTester> i think there is great synergy between the projects and we can solve a lot of really cool problems
2011-04-10T15:52:05  <AutomatedTester> its quite funny that 2 of the 4 language maintainers started in the watir/watin world
2011-04-10T15:53:03  <charleyb> we're solving the same problems
2011-04-10T15:53:15  <charleyb> i just like our api better :D
2011-04-10T15:53:38  <charleyb> to me, it's always been about the api
2011-04-10T15:53:44  <AutomatedTester> +1
2011-04-10T15:53:52  <AutomatedTester> i hate the Selenium API
2011-04-10T15:54:00  <charleyb> it's sucky
2011-04-10T15:54:21  <charleyb> betterish now?
2011-04-10T15:54:27  <charleyb> but still not great
2011-04-10T15:54:38  <AutomatedTester> its fixed
2011-04-10T15:54:45  <AutomatedTester> its fixed at 160 calls

2011-04-10T15:55:26  <charleyb> with better apis

2011-04-10T15:56:47  <AutomatedTester> i think the watir api is great for rubyists
2011-04-10T15:56:59  <AutomatedTester> but for other languages I prefer the webdriver stuff
2011-04-10T15:57:20  <AutomatedTester> plus when I get it into Firefox then I will be really happy

2011-04-10T15:58:17  <charleyb> haha :)
2011-04-10T15:59:17  <charleyb> i wouldn't mind learning python
2011-04-10T15:59:37  <AutomatedTester> charleyb: its Ruby but with explicit returns
2011-04-10T15:59:42  <AutomatedTester> well thats my take on it
2011-04-10T15:59:53  <AutomatedTester> but havent played with Ruby enough
2011-04-10T15:59:53  <AutomatedTester> \
2011-04-10T16:00:02  <charleyb> and self passed everywhere and horky _________
2011-04-10T16:00:06  <charleyb> methods
2011-04-10T16:00:26  <charleyb> then whitespacing, which whatever
2011-04-10T16:00:49  <AutomatedTester> you do the whitespacing now when you code, its called clean code
2011-04-10T16:00:58  <charleyb> i have played around with python :)
2011-04-10T16:01:22  <AutomatedTester> having self means you can abuse MonkeyPatching
2011-04-10T16:01:32  <charleyb> sez you
2011-04-10T16:01:59  <charleyb> every f'in method seems to not know the context
2011-04-10T16:02:44  <charleyb> whitespacing is still maddening
2011-04-10T16:03:41  <charleyb> here's my take
2011-04-10T16:04:04  <charleyb> sorry to all who are following this in irc now
2011-04-10T16:04:28  <charleyb> and i'll keep it short
2011-04-10T16:04:55  <charleyb> ruby has several antecedants for programming langs
2011-04-10T16:05:10  <charleyb> i'll pick on two right now
2011-04-10T16:05:37  <charleyb> perl  - get anything done however the hell you want to do things and i don't care
2011-04-10T16:06:16  <charleyb> python - you listen to guido, and this is the way we're doing things, you will not stray
2011-04-10T16:07:25  <charleyb> ruby - there are several ways to do things, you can use whatever, but the community suggests the right way
2011-04-10T16:08:19  <AutomatedTester> i dunno if I agree with the python thing. So while guido created the language the community has driven it to the way we want it
2011-04-10T16:08:24  <charleyb>  and /end rant
2011-04-10T16:08:45  <AutomatedTester> i dont follow was Guido says so thats my basis
2011-04-10T16:09:14  <AutomatedTester> i have worked in a number of languages and I do what I think is right and make it fit the language
2011-04-10T16:09:44  <AutomatedTester> I see a lot of similarities between python and c#
2011-04-10T16:10:09  <charleyb> would love to talk to you about that
2011-04-10T16:10:18  <AutomatedTester> but I agree with the whitespacing, thats annoying
2011-04-10T16:10:25  <charleyb> i think we've derailed the channel :)
2011-04-10T16:10:34  <AutomatedTester> I do like how Ruby is more natural language
2011-04-10T16:10:49  <AutomatedTester> I dont think anyone else is in here, or in here and needs help so its cool
2011-04-10T16:10:57  <charleyb> fair enough
2011-04-10T16:11:00  <AutomatedTester> but beware, selbot sees all
2011-04-10T16:11:05  <AutomatedTester> logs all
2011-04-10T16:11:09  <charleyb> i don't care
2011-04-10T16:11:24  <AutomatedTester> neither do I but some people do
2011-04-10T16:11:34  <charleyb> i make all sorts of insane remarks :)
2011-04-10T16:11:42  <AutomatedTester> brb... tissue run, *stupid cold*
2011-04-10T16:12:07  <charleyb> python and c#, you'll have to explain that one
2011-04-10T16:14:43  <AutomatedTester> so from .NET 3.0-ish, there is a concept of a tagging a variable with var. This is kinda like variant in Visual Basic
2011-04-10T16:15:01  <AutomatedTester> so when you are writting your code, you dont care about the type, thats the job of the complier
2011-04-10T16:15:06  <AutomatedTester> compiler
2011-04-10T16:15:36  <AutomatedTester> the same with is in python, might be ruby but havent done enough ruby
2011-04-10T16:16:02  <AutomatedTester> lemme write a quick example
2011-04-10T16:17:58  <AutomatedTester> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1201812
2011-04-10T16:18:07  <AutomatedTester> so thats a really trvial example
2011-04-10T16:18:30  <AutomatedTester> so I think of it as a dynamic statically typed language
2011-04-10T16:19:14  <AutomatedTester> but in c# once the compiler chooses a type its fixed when python can kinda let you get away with more since everything is in RunTime not CompileTime
2011-04-10T16:20:10  *** christophermcm-1 has joined #selenium
2011-04-10T16:20:20  <AutomatedTester> c# lambdas are very similar to python lambdas
2011-04-10T16:20:39  <AutomatedTester> Java lambdas are extremely clumsy from the ones I have seen
2011-04-10T16:20:44  <christophermcm-1> I wanted to see charleyb getting schooled :)
2011-04-10T16:21:22  <charleyb> so you can tag dynamic values in c#?
2011-04-10T16:21:37  <AutomatedTester> yea, in .net 4
2011-04-10T16:21:44  <AutomatedTester> there is now a Dynamic Type
2011-04-10T16:21:52  *** Archdude has quit IRC
2011-04-10T16:21:56  <AutomatedTester> havent played with it enough
2011-04-10T16:22:11  *** Archdude has joined #selenium
2011-04-10T16:22:35  <charleyb> so how often is this used in practice?
2011-04-10T16:23:06  <AutomatedTester> Dynamic Types are becoming common practise
2011-04-10T16:23:06  *** Archdude has quit IRC
2011-04-10T16:23:34  <charleyb> python has the concept of static typing as well?
2011-04-10T16:23:40  <AutomatedTester> it does
2011-04-10T16:23:53  *** Archdude has joined #selenium
2011-04-10T16:23:58  <AutomatedTester> and it has clean lambda structures
2011-04-10T16:24:08  <charleyb> skip that for now
2011-04-10T16:24:28  <AutomatedTester> but the reason why .NET gets away with it is everything is compiled down to the same byte code
2011-04-10T16:24:35  *** ian_mac has quit IRC
2011-04-10T16:24:41  <AutomatedTester> so we have the CLR and the DLR
2011-04-10T16:25:49  <charleyb> ruby is dynamic but strongly typed
2011-04-10T16:25:57  <AutomatedTester> so ironruby and ironpython compile to DLR then to CLR
2011-04-10T16:26:07  <AutomatedTester> which allows the interop
2011-04-10T16:26:11  <AutomatedTester> python is the same
2011-04-10T16:26:12  <charleyb> yeah, that's a bit strange
2011-04-10T16:26:29  <charleyb> .net is as well?
2011-04-10T16:26:40  *** christophermcm-1 has left #selenium
2011-04-10T16:27:10  <AutomatedTester> .NET is a statically typed language
2011-04-10T16:27:15  <charleyb> yep
2011-04-10T16:27:31  <AutomatedTester> but because of the newer types, the ability to not care about types
2011-04-10T16:27:35  <AutomatedTester> hence the var
2011-04-10T16:27:41  <AutomatedTester> and the Dynamic Type
2011-04-10T16:27:53  <charleyb> interesting
2011-04-10T16:27:53  <AutomatedTester> you can do things that allow you to get into trouble
2011-04-10T16:28:16  <AutomatedTester> which means you can run into Runtime errors, like Ruby/Python
2011-04-10T16:28:22  <charleyb> java has a bit of that as well
2011-04-10T16:28:24  <AutomatedTester> and the compiler may not notice
2011-04-10T16:28:39  <AutomatedTester> it does but I find it clunky
2011-04-10T16:28:54  <AutomatedTester> and doesnt always do what I expect
2011-04-10T16:29:03  <charleyb> it is, and dependent on some jsrs that are coming out
2011-04-10T16:29:05  <AutomatedTester> but I am a language snob
2011-04-10T16:29:44  <AutomatedTester> btw, I would say this is schooling :P
2011-04-10T16:29:45  <charleyb> not if you're using c#
2011-04-10T16:29:47  <charleyb> :P
2011-04-10T16:30:10  <AutomatedTester> c# is a nice clean, statically typed language
2011-04-10T16:30:25  <charleyb> i've never used it

2011-04-10T16:33:11  <charleyb> indeed
2011-04-10T16:33:23  <AutomatedTester> charleyb: good examples, albeit a bit dated, http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/Chapter5/Closures.aspx
2011-04-10T16:33:33  <charleyb> this falls into the what the f to use for testing
2011-04-10T16:34:13  <AutomatedTester> My approach is use the language in the shop or Ruby/Python
2011-04-10T16:34:37  <AutomatedTester> if the devs can support automators in Ruby/Python then +1 for that
2011-04-10T16:34:38  <charleyb> java is suffering from the committee
2011-04-10T16:34:56  <AutomatedTester> yea
2011-04-10T16:35:32  <adamgoucher> if shop language is php, then php. if shop language is java, then jython/jruby. if shop language is .net, then ironpython/ironruby. if shop language is python or ruby, then just that
2011-04-10T16:35:57  <charleyb> i don't agree with that
2011-04-10T16:37:04  <charleyb> and having pushed watir at facebook, and other companies, i don't get it
2011-04-10T16:37:23  <adamgoucher> heh. well, that is my equation -- things that fall out of that then i politely (yes, i can shockingly be that) decline :)
2011-04-10T16:37:37  <charleyb> there may be some advantage occasionally for interop
2011-04-10T16:38:14  <charleyb> but i don't generally see that
2011-04-10T16:39:16  <adamgoucher> i've had large success with jython in a couple companies now. so much easier to teach new people it than java. lighterweight, etc. as a bonus
2011-04-10T16:40:26  <charleyb> i've done that too, just to set up cruddy mq instances and and websphere, but i don't see that as a long term strategy

2011-04-10T17:25:08  <charleyb> c# and java, no big diff :)
2011-04-10T17:25:15  <nirvdrum> I've been bashing my head trying to work this thing out for the last 3 hours.
2011-04-10T17:25:38  <AutomatedTester> nirvdrum: I can have a look
2011-04-10T17:25:40  <nirvdrum> If I was ever good at Java, that was a while ago.
2011-04-10T17:25:49  <AutomatedTester> but cant promise much
2011-04-10T17:25:51  <nirvdrum> AutomatedTester: It has to do with nuances around HTTP responses.
2011-04-10T17:26:03  <AutomatedTester> oh in that case dont worry
2011-04-10T17:26:10  <nirvdrum> Basically grid proxies them.  I think when we proxy chunked responses we're mangling the response body.
2011-04-10T17:27:47  <AutomatedTester> i havent done Java in a while to remember its nuances
2011-04-10T17:27:54  <nirvdrum> Me neither.
2011-04-10T17:28:05  <nirvdrum> At least this part of it.

2011-04-10T17:28:42  <nirvdrum> I guess the Java http clients handle this better, so Francois didn't notice it.
2011-04-10T17:28:44  <charleyb> might as well post it
2011-04-10T17:28:45  <nirvdrum> But it's a problem for the Ruby client.

2011-04-10T19:25:10  <aboyer2011> Good evening, all.
2011-04-10T19:25:47  <aboyer2011> Quick question about selenium webdriver java drivers, and groovy support.
2011-04-10T19:26:29  <aboyer2011> If I'm seeing things correctly, it looks like there's no groovy support yet.  Does that sound correct?
2011-04-10T19:27:09  <adamgoucher> ish correct, yes. or if there is support for it, it is not from the 'core' project but from a 3rd party
2011-04-10T19:27:32  <aboyer2011> Ok, at least I'm not going blind
2011-04-10T19:27:48  <aboyer2011> Thanks
