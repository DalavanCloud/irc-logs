2011-07-12T01:34:59  <__mike> does the url to openwindow need to be a full one ?

2011-07-12T01:49:32  <Krishnan> Because for me execution was incomplete...
2011-07-12T01:50:20  <Krishnan> for me openWindow() was launching the new URL in a new window, but execution wasnt proceeding after that.. was getting stuck at the openWindow() method
2011-07-12T01:50:30  <soc42> according to the release notes on selenium v1.1.0 the php-support is dropped.

2011-07-12T02:34:03  <davehunt> AutomatedTester: We already know these aren't timeouts because the hub logs those, and our hub console has nothing when these issues are occurring

It sank into the swamp. So I built a second one. That sank into  the swamp. So I built a third. That burned down, fell over, then sank  into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up. And that's what you're  going to get, Lad, the strongest castle in all of England.

2011-07-12T06:57:00  <AutomatedTester> uh oh
2011-07-12T06:57:08  <simonstewart> The only reason for the bajillion geko sdks is because of the need to get the window handle
2011-07-12T06:57:30  <simonstewart> We fix that, we fix the gecko sdk problem
2011-07-12T06:57:37  <simonstewart> And can use jsctypes to fire native events
2011-07-12T06:57:43  <simonstewart> So: two choices
2011-07-12T06:57:51  <simonstewart> We need to either
2011-07-12T06:58:03  <simonstewart> 1) persuade mozilla to expose a method for getting the window handle
2011-07-12T06:58:16  <simonstewart> 2) ship versions of wdIMouse and wdIKeyboard with firefox
2011-07-12T06:58:55  <simonstewart> Which should we favour?
2011-07-12T06:59:35  <barancev> anybody knows an example of Jetty7 security realm configuration via API only, without realm.properties file?
2011-07-12T06:59:37  <AutomatedTester> hmm
2011-07-12T07:00:01  <AutomatedTester> I think 1 will be the easier of the 2 options
2011-07-12T07:00:25  <eranm> AutomatedTester, I hate to point out that (2) makes more sense from a usability perspective
2011-07-12T07:00:46  <eranm> (as it's probably more difficult to do)
2011-07-12T07:01:04  <AutomatedTester> eranm: you appear to be making the same argument as me :)
2011-07-12T07:01:21  <AutomatedTester> 1 == easier
2011-07-12T07:01:34  <AutomatedTester> 2 == more difficult but probably better route in long run
2011-07-12T07:01:44  <AutomatedTester> no?

2011-07-12T07:02:54  <simonstewart> Agreed
2011-07-12T07:03:02  <simonstewart> 2 is the better long term option

2011-07-12T07:24:51  <polm> Yesterday I asked if all clicks were equal and I heard no; what the right way to do mouse-down and mouse-up explicitly?
2011-07-12T07:25:04  <polm> In python, that is
2011-07-12T07:25:07  <simonstewart> polm: what are you trying to do?
2011-07-12T07:25:25  <polm> simonstewart: I am clicking on some things and it is not firing javascript as expected
2011-07-12T07:25:33  <polm> someelement.click()
2011-07-12T07:25:49  <polm> Is not functioning equivalently to a real physical click.
2011-07-12T07:26:09  <simonstewart> it should be functioning as a real click
2011-07-12T07:26:34  <simonstewart> it'd be better for everyone to make us focus on fixing click rather than trying to work around odd behaviour
2011-07-12T07:27:22  <polm> simonstewart: That's true, though I'd like to be able to just get something working...
2011-07-12T07:27:54  <simonstewart> If you're crazy keen, the create a helper method
2011-07-12T07:28:37  <simonstewart> and take a look at the MouseEvent class from the WebDriverBackedSelenium
2011-07-12T07:28:45  <simonstewart> or do something like:
2011-07-12T07:28:49  <polm> simonstewart: I have nothing better to do; thanks
2011-07-12T07:29:16  <simonstewart> The MouseEvent class is used by the WebDriverBackedSelenium to emulate mouse down and up
2011-07-12T07:29:20  <simonstewart> So all the code you need is there
2011-07-12T07:29:23  <simonstewart> You could even do:
2011-07-12T07:29:45  <simonstewart> new WEbDriverBackedSelenium(driver).mouseDown("locator");
2011-07-12T07:30:00  <polm> python
2011-07-12T07:30:07  <simonstewart> Ah.
2011-07-12T07:30:12  <polm> I think I found the stuff, though.
2011-07-12T07:30:14  <simonstewart> Is there a reduced test case somewhere?
2011-07-12T07:30:36  <polm> No, unfortunately; we're not sure what quirk of javascript is causing this.
2011-07-12T07:30:55  <polm> Theoretically all our javascript should be triggered by the same events, and lots of tests are working...
2011-07-12T07:31:01  <simonstewart> Furrfu

2011-07-12T09:28:36  <mdirkse> how can I use the webdriver to make sure an element is *not* on the page? findElement throws an exception if it can't find what you're looking for, but only after a delay.
2011-07-12T09:29:12  <jimevans> mdirkse: after a delay?
2011-07-12T09:29:32  <antlong> mdirkse: try/except
2011-07-12T09:30:09  <jarib> mdirkse: if you've set up implicit waits, there will be a delay, yes
2011-07-12T09:30:12  <jimevans> mdirkse: catching the exception is the proper way to handle that, but i'm concerned about the delay you mentioned
2011-07-12T09:30:19  <mdirkse> jimevans: yeah, so I do findElement(), and eventually it throws an exception, but only after a certain delay
2011-07-12T09:30:45  <jarib> one of the reasons i generally prefer explicit waits.
2011-07-12T09:31:37  <mdirkse> jimevans: that's the implicit wait I've set, but I was looking for a way to get findElement to fail fast. But if you say the proper way is to catch that exception, I can set the implicitwait to 1 milisecond and then reset it after the test
2011-07-12T09:31:56  <jimevans> or set it to 0.
2011-07-12T09:32:15  <jimevans> yes, that would be the way to do it.

2011-07-12T09:36:33  <jimevans> brook: that's pretty much it. there's not any real work going into enhancing the Selenium RC API (which is what WebDriverBackedSelenium exposes and what IDE generally record)

2011-07-12T09:37:14  <brook> So should I not use the IDE?  Or is this something that is going to be added to the IDE in the near term?
2011-07-12T09:38:24  <jimevans> There are formatters under development to export WebDriver API code from IDE. Whether or not you should use IDE is another discussion.

2011-07-12T11:31:35  <jarib> i doubt that's the problem
2011-07-12T11:31:45  <jarib> based on the error.

2011-07-12T11:32:57  <ian_mac_>                 $element = $this->driver->get_element('tag name=div');

2011-07-12T11:33:42  <ian_mac_> so I'll have to play more and see if I can isolate the problem
2011-07-12T11:33:43  <jarib> does it work in firefox?

2011-07-12T11:34:22  <jarib> would be helpful if the chrome driver could give us the js stack trace.
2011-07-12T11:37:04  <ian_mac_> ok so it doesn't like that page in chrome for some reason
2011-07-12T11:37:05  <ian_mac_> how odd

2011-07-12T11:47:50  <jarib> unsurprisingly, i can reproduce the message by doing    driver.execute_script "var a = []; a.push(a); return a;"
2011-07-12T11:48:08  <jarib> i'm guessing some JS on your page is messing with the webdriver atoms :(
2011-07-12T11:48:14  <jarib> ian_mac_: does chrome stay open after the error?
2011-07-12T11:48:21  <ian_mac_> yeah
2011-07-12T11:48:23  <autojack> oh boy. I need to interact with a file upload dialog. I know Selenium can't interact with the OS file selection window. on the browser side, we're apparently using a Flash utility to handle the upload, so it doesn't look like I can just feed in a path to a file. HMM.
2011-07-12T11:48:28  <autojack> any ideas?
2011-07-12T11:48:29  <ian_mac_> though the browser always stays open

2011-07-12T12:34:53  <christophermcmah> thanks jarib.  if you run the script here http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/04/selenium-its-not-just-for-testing-anymore-ipad-contest/comment-page-1/#comment-832 (that you helped me with, thanks again) with s-w2 2.0.1/FF5/Ruby 1.8.7, the line that starts "@browser.find_elements(:tag_name, ‘a’).select" kicks up an error "private method `select' called for #<Selenium::WebDriver::Element"
2011-07-12T12:35:26  <christophermcmah> but that select() should be Ruby's Hash#select, not Selenium::Webdriver::Element select jarib
2011-07-12T12:36:13  <jarib> christophermcmah: Element#select was deprecated in 0.2.1-2 (can't remember exactly), and then removed in 2.0.0
2011-07-12T12:37:03  <jarib> actually, the line you're referring to won't throw that error
2011-07-12T12:37:13  <christophermcmah> and yet it does
2011-07-12T12:37:18  <jarib> find_elements (plural) will return an array, so select should be fine there
2011-07-12T12:38:15  <christophermcmah> so Array#select not Hash#select.  still, for some reason that line is using Selenium's Element#select when I run it.
2011-07-12T12:38:29  <christophermcmah> and getting an error and stopping of course
2011-07-12T12:39:00  <jarib> are you passing a block to #select?
2011-07-12T12:39:08  <jarib> which calls Element#select?
2011-07-12T12:39:57  <christophermcmah> not that I know of.  this script worked fine with FF 3.x and an earlier version of selenium-webdriver, and started failing after I upgraded both to the current versions.
2011-07-12T12:40:10  <jarib> could you :gist the exact script and the full backtrace?

2011-07-12T12:43:30  <jarib> christophermcmah: ah, yes - the do_search method calls find_element(...).select
2011-07-12T12:44:22  <jarib> the second stack frame in the trace refers to that line (where do_search is called)
2011-07-12T12:44:30  <jarib> the actual error refers to cscrape_se3.rb:6 - line 6
2011-07-12T12:44:38  <christophermcmah> oh duh, thanks
2011-07-12T12:44:40  <jarib> so just replace those .select calls with .click and you should be good
2011-07-12T12:45:31  <jarib> unfortunately it's a bit confusing with the method visibility message instead of a plain old NoMethodError
2011-07-12T12:45:44  <jarib> it refers to Kernel#select
2011-07-12T12:45:59  <patrick99e99> wow, jarib...  I finally narrowed down the code that causes the failure
2011-07-12T12:46:15  <jarib> ok?
2011-07-12T12:46:17  <patrick99e99> visit person_path(post.user.person);   assert has_no_content?('The change you wanted was rejected.')
2011-07-12T12:46:21  <christophermcmah> thanks, it's working again after replacing select with click.  sweet.
2011-07-12T12:46:36  <patrick99e99> with that commented out, it passes..
2011-07-12T12:48:33  <patrick99e99> assert has_no_content?('The change you wanted was rejected.')  is the actual line that causes that funky error
2011-07-12T12:49:49  <patrick99e99> but the weird thing is, there are multiple tests for that in the file
2011-07-12T12:50:10  <patrick99e99> and it's the 2nd one that blows up
2011-07-12T12:51:57  <jarib> patrick99e99: would be interesting to see the HTML
2011-07-12T12:52:36  <patrick99e99> jarib, well the test is basically making sure that we aren't seeing the 422 error page
2011-07-12T12:52:37  *** Mayank has quit IRC
2011-07-12T12:52:42  <patrick99e99> but it IS showing the 422 error page

2011-07-12T12:52:50  <patrick99e99> (the 422 error page says "the change you wanted was rejected")
2011-07-12T12:52:58  <patrick99e99> and that is making selenium say Selenium::WebDriver::Error::UnhandledError: Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE) [nsIDOMXPathEvaluator.createNSResolver]

2011-07-12T12:53:40  <patrick99e99> oops im sorry, I misread this..  It is verifying that we ARE on the 422 page
2011-07-12T12:54:08  <jarib> still, seeing the HTML of the page would help :)
2011-07-12T12:54:37  <patrick99e99> ok

2011-07-12T12:57:27  <patrick99e99> jarib, https://gist.github.com/1078851
2011-07-12T12:57:44  <patrick99e99> maybe it's because there is a commented out doctype?
2011-07-12T12:57:50  <patrick99e99> inside the html...
2011-07-12T12:58:07  <patrick99e99> they are basically using the 422 error page as a partial for inside the application layout
2011-07-12T12:58:20  <patrick99e99> so they did some funky stuff with commenting out the doctype
2011-07-12T12:58:30  <miker2> Is there a simple way to pause WebDriver for a specific amount of time?
2011-07-12T12:58:46  <autojack> I just call sleep() in Ruby :)
2011-07-12T12:59:46  <miker2> I was using Thread.sleep in java, but that doesn't seem to work nicely on the grid.
2011-07-12T13:00:07  <miker2> curious if there's a less-hacky way of doing it
2011-07-12T13:00:32  <autojack> with a Wait object maybe?
2011-07-12T13:01:14  <patrick99e99> jarib, yep...  I got rid of the doctype stuff and it passes
2011-07-12T13:01:26  <patrick99e99> sorry for bothering you.. that was a really dumb thing.
2011-07-12T13:02:03  <miker2> autojack: most of those are waiting for a specific element.  It appears Thread.sleep is good enough for now

2011-07-12T13:04:56  <ian_mac_> right

2011-07-12T13:05:22  <ian_mac_> right

2011-07-12T13:17:34  <jarib> ian_mac_: a workaround for you would be to do find_element(:tag_name => "body").find_element(:id => "...")
2011-07-12T13:17:47  <jarib> e.g. make sure the root node isn't the document, but something else
2011-07-12T13:18:00  <ian_mac_> ah ok
2011-07-12T13:18:04  <ian_mac_> will try that out
2011-07-12T13:18:46  <ian_mac_> I guess relying on javascript is challenging when classes can be redefined/monkey patched in a myriad of ways
2011-07-12T13:19:15  <jarib> yeah :(
2011-07-12T13:20:29  <ian_mac_> is that only done in ChromeDriver?  or is it done in the other drivers also?
2011-07-12T13:20:34  <jimevans> what it means, is that our feature detection is broked. and that MooTools is behaving badly by polluting the global namespace.
2011-07-12T13:21:10  <jarib> ian_mac_: IE and Firefox also use the JS atoms, so a bit surprised it doesn't happen there. may just be luck
2011-07-12T13:21:34  <ian_mac_> I haven't tried IE, just Firefox and Opera, but yeah.  weird.
2011-07-12T13:22:00  <ian_mac_> extending natives is a design choice in Mootools  *shrug*  (a debated one)
2011-07-12T13:22:05  *** pavelko has joined #selenium
2011-07-12T13:22:42  <jimevans> well, like I said, our feature detection is likely broked too.
2011-07-12T13:22:58  <jimevans> jarib: where's the code that we look for .contains() in the atoms?

2011-07-12T13:24:10  <jarib> jimevans: one solution would be https://gist.github.com/1078912
2011-07-12T13:24:51  <jarib> but if that's the approach, there will be a lot of places to fix in closure
2011-07-12T13:25:14  <jarib> not sure if we can realistically make them do that.
2011-07-12T13:25:29  <jarib> i'll write to the dev list
2011-07-12T13:26:01  <jimevans> sounds like something the closure folks should know about. (don't know which dev list you mean)

2011-07-12T13:56:41  <jimevans> WebDriver can handle the file dialog when accessed from an <input type="file"> element
2011-07-12T13:56:58  <autojack> ahh
2011-07-12T13:57:02  <jimevans> but you've got a flash object managing that, which you'll need a solution to handle.
2011-07-12T13:57:19  <autojack> yeah I'm looking at what the flash does
2011-07-12T13:57:26  <autojack> the file name/path itself never appears in the HTML.
2011-07-12T13:57:42  <autojack> the flash swf seems to just store a reference ID to the file after it is selected.
2011-07-12T13:58:03  <autojack> there are some js methods you can call to manipulate those, but I don't see any way to insert files into the queue.
2011-07-12T13:58:24  <autojack> http://www.uploadify.com/documentation/
2011-07-12T13:58:44  <autojack> so I'm not sure an <input type> tag is ever created.
2011-07-12T13:58:51  <jimevans> If not, then I don't think there's anything WebDriver can do to help.
2011-07-12T13:58:55  <autojack> nod
2011-07-12T14:00:06  <autojack> looks like this is the input path
2011-07-12T14:00:07  <autojack> <input width="120" type="file" height="30" name="Filedata" id="file_upload" style="display: none;">
2011-07-12T14:00:23  <autojack> guessing that doesn't help.
2011-07-12T14:00:46  <jimevans> right, but reading the docs, it looks like the <input> element gets replaced in the dom.
2011-07-12T14:01:41  <autojack> oh yeah, I see
2011-07-12T14:02:09  <autojack> yeah when I load the page I don't see <input id="file_upload" name="file_upload" type="file" /> anywhere
2011-07-12T14:04:00  <ian_mac_> it is somewhat of a security hole to allow javascript access to selecting files on the local machine
2011-07-12T14:04:32  <autojack> make sense.
2011-07-12T14:05:02  <autojack> I just don't know how I'm going to work around this.
2011-07-12T14:05:54  <autojack> I can manually add the files and then dump the database, and then insert those rows before I run my test suite... but I think we can all agree that that approach blows :)

2011-07-12T14:07:30  <ian_mac_> and that doesn't get uploadify tested
2011-07-12T14:07:36  <antlong> or sikuli
2011-07-12T14:07:50  <autojack> I can live without testing the actual uploadify component.
2011-07-12T14:08:04  <autojack> I thought about Sikuli, I'm just not sure how I would integrate it here.

2011-07-12T14:10:13  <autojack> basically, my company's product has a component that allows people to upload a jpg and a video, and then "link" them logically as a single unit to display somewhere (think video ad and companion ad image).
2011-07-12T14:10:37  <autojack> so I need to be able to automatically upload the two assets and then perform the other actions to link them.
2011-07-12T14:12:01  <autojack> hmm.
2011-07-12T14:12:05  *** csanchez has quit IRC
2011-07-12T14:12:24  <autojack> sounds like I should look at the xhr tab while I perform an upload, to see what happens there?
2011-07-12T14:12:44  <ian_mac_> well, your flash will make a reques to your server
2011-07-12T14:13:03  <ian_mac_> it *may* be possible to execute that request in javascript
2011-07-12T14:13:17  <ian_mac_> I've never done it with file uploads though
2011-07-12T14:13:45  <autojack> hmm
2011-07-12T14:13:55  <autojack> when the upload happens, I see nothing in the XHR tab.
2011-07-12T14:14:17  <ian_mac_> well, it is generated by flash
2011-07-12T14:14:21  <ian_mac_> not the browser
2011-07-12T14:15:15  <jarib> autojack: the only approach i know of is looking at Flash's externalInterface for communicating with JS, then using that through WebDriver's executeScript
2011-07-12T14:15:29  <jarib> i've never used it though
2011-07-12T14:15:39  <jarib> may require changes in the swf to expose the stuff you need
2011-07-12T14:15:44  <autojack> right
2011-07-12T14:15:49  <autojack> now I see something in the XHR
2011-07-12T14:15:53  <antlong> you said you need to upload 2 files, its not worth this much trouble to do that
2011-07-12T14:16:08  <autojack> well, I need to upload files every time the test runs.
2011-07-12T14:16:25  <antlong> how often is that going to be
2011-07-12T14:16:36  <antlong> and why do you need to reupload the file each time
2011-07-12T14:16:41  <antlong> youre not testing uploadify, right
2011-07-12T14:17:07  <autojack> we were intending to clear the DB before each test run, to start with a clean state.
2011-07-12T14:17:35  <autojack> and the files are associated with other assets in the system which are currently created dynamically each time the test runs.
2011-07-12T14:17:51  <autojack> e.g. they are linked to a user that gets created.
2011-07-12T14:18:00  <autojack> I dunno.
2011-07-12T14:18:07  <antlong> i dont get why you need uploadify to do this
2011-07-12T14:18:47  <ian_mac_> he doesn't
2011-07-12T14:18:53  <autojack> uploadify is already in place, chosen by our developers as The Way To Upload Files.
2011-07-12T14:18:54  <ian_mac_> but the app he's testing uses uploadify
2011-07-12T14:18:56  <ian_mac_> IIUC
2011-07-12T14:19:02  <autojack> so in a sense, no, I do not need to test Uploadify.
2011-07-12T14:19:07  <antlong> autojack: so dont :)
2011-07-12T14:19:17  <autojack> but to make my test of our APPLICATION complete, I need to upload files somehow.
2011-07-12T14:19:29  <antlong> if you just need to upload a file and have it web accessible, run XAMPP or something similar and have a form submit that takes a file
2011-07-12T14:19:40  <autojack> it's more than that.
2011-07-12T14:19:46  <antlong> well its not
2011-07-12T14:19:49  <autojack> the file is added to a DB and becomes accessible to our whole application.
2011-07-12T14:20:06  <antlong> right, its the same thing though, whether the file is hosted by uploadify, or by imageshack or locally
2011-07-12T14:20:18  *** jimevans has left #selenium
2011-07-12T14:20:23  <antlong> either way the file is web accessible, and youre creating links to it in your db
2011-07-12T14:20:39  <autojack> so how are you proposing that I create the links in my DB?
2011-07-12T14:20:50  <autojack> if not through the mechanism that already exists to do that?
2011-07-12T14:20:51  <antlong> it doesnt matter where the file is hosted, as long as its web accessible
2011-07-12T14:21:11  <jarib> is uploadify open source?
2011-07-12T14:21:15  <autojack> I think you're making assumptions about how my company's product works that may not be valid :)
2011-07-12T14:21:22  <antlong> im pretty sure its valid
2011-07-12T14:21:23  <autojack> for all you know, we're storing the image as a blob in the DB.
2011-07-12T14:21:25  <autojack> heh
2011-07-12T14:21:32  <antlong> why bother uploading the asset somewhere then
2011-07-12T14:21:40  <antlong> if that was the case you woudl insert it right in to the db
2011-07-12T14:22:10  <autojack> this is getting hypothetical since I don't personally know what we do with the asset.
2011-07-12T14:22:16  <antlong> i do
2011-07-12T14:22:24  <antlong> :->
2011-07-12T14:22:27  <autojack> heh
2011-07-12T14:22:30  <antlong> anywaysss
2011-07-12T14:22:32  <autojack> yeah
2011-07-12T14:22:56  *** cakehero has quit IRC
2011-07-12T14:23:05  <autojack> what is your proposed solution again? just upload the file somewhere and *waves hands*?
2011-07-12T14:23:06  <antlong> yeah, so unless you want to 1) learn JS quick, 2) use a GUI automation tool, then think more about what youre actually testing here, not HOW youre testing it
2011-07-12T14:23:34  <antlong> autojack: yeah, you can host it locally, or find a website that doesnt use a flash uploader
2011-07-12T14:23:52  <antlong> and if you need to test using uploadify, then write one test in sikuli that would test their upload form
2011-07-12T14:24:21  <autojack> you understand the fact that we are using Uploadify INSIDE our own product right... not using it to upload files to some arbitrary web server somewhere on the internet that we don't control, a la Dropbox, etc?
2011-07-12T14:24:39  <autojack> we use it to allow users to upload files TO US.
2011-07-12T14:24:45  <antlong> no, but im pretty confident that it doesnt matter
2011-07-12T14:24:51  <autojack> hehe
2011-07-12T14:24:53  <antlong> i would think that the only thing you actually need, is a link to the asset
2011-07-12T14:25:22  <autojack> so you're suggesting that I get that link, and then do what with it?
2011-07-12T14:25:32  <autojack> manually add it to the DB to associate it with our application?
2011-07-12T14:25:41  <antlong> you can automagically add it to the database
2011-07-12T14:25:51  <antlong> but you probably wouldnt even need to, if the file was local
2011-07-12T14:26:07  <antlong> you could prepopulate the db with that link, and run your actual tests
2011-07-12T14:26:16  <autojack> right.
2011-07-12T14:26:22  <autojack> that was what I was hoping to avoid.
2011-07-12T14:26:26  <antlong> i used to have this issue a long time ago
2011-07-12T14:26:30  *** QAguy has quit IRC
2011-07-12T14:26:41  <antlong> when you spend too much time thinking about how to test things, without thinking about what youre actually testing
2011-07-12T14:26:55  <autojack> I was just looking for a quick solution to my problem :)
2011-07-12T14:27:07  <antlong> the only test you really need, is uploading an image once or so, and checking that uploadify returns a valid URL for that asset to your application
2011-07-12T14:27:10  <autojack> instead of a hacky solution.
2011-07-12T14:27:20  <antlong> you dont want to get in to the business of testing peoples websites who arent paying you
2011-07-12T14:27:37  *** red^ is now known as reddeviL
2011-07-12T14:27:41  <autojack> again you're thinking that Uploadify is some kind of file storage service.
2011-07-12T14:27:43  <autojack> it isn't.
2011-07-12T14:27:44  <antlong> autojack: you from canada?
2011-07-12T14:27:50  <jarib> lol
2011-07-12T14:27:55  <autojack> it's a Flash app that we're using on our site that uploads files to us.
2011-07-12T14:28:09  *** freynaud has left #selenium
2011-07-12T14:28:21  <antlong> autojack: so youre saying its a file storage service
2011-07-12T14:28:33  <autojack> *rolls eyes*
2011-07-12T14:28:57  <autojack> did I misunderstand y our comment about testing peoples' websites who aren't paying me?
2011-07-12T14:28:58  <antlong> i know what it is i think, its just an interface for uploading things
2011-07-12T14:29:32  <antlong> autojack: probably, my point is that its not your job to test other peoples websites exhaustively, run the simple integration tests you need, and focus your time on your own job
2011-07-12T14:29:48  <autojack> I'm definitely not testing anyone else's web site.
2011-07-12T14:30:01  <autojack> so I'm glad we're in agreement about how unnecessary that is :)
2011-07-12T14:30:44  <autojack> it would be nice if I could, as part of my testing of OUR PRODUCT, validate the fact that the Uploadify SWF, which WE HOST, which allows users to upload files TO US, actually works.
2011-07-12T14:30:46  *** AJ_ has quit IRC
2011-07-12T14:30:58  <antlong> autojack: right, but youre using a flash plugin
2011-07-12T14:31:07  <antlong> autojack: flash wasnt meant to be automated
2011-07-12T14:31:14  <autojack> I know. I wish we weren't :(
2011-07-12T14:31:27  <autojack> from what I can tell it's pretty unnecessary here.
2011-07-12T14:31:27  <antlong> they have a pure JS implementation, maybe you should petition a switch over
2011-07-12T14:31:31  <autojack> yeah
2011-07-12T14:31:34  *** nirvdrum has quit IRC
2011-07-12T14:31:47  <jarib> do they use flash as a fallback in older browsers maybe?
2011-07-12T14:31:49  <autojack> the Uploadify swf seems to mostly give you a "queue" concept for uploading multiple files.
2011-07-12T14:31:55  <antlong> also
2011-07-12T14:31:58  <autojack> which we do not use.
2011-07-12T14:32:02  <antlong> if you disable flash, there should be a pure html version
2011-07-12T14:32:03  <autojack> so I don't see what the point of it is.
2011-07-12T14:32:06  <antlong> so give that a shot
2011-07-12T14:32:14  <autojack> hmm, maybe :)
2011-07-12T14:32:18  <autojack> I'm not sure we're that smart.
2011-07-12T14:32:29  <jarib> perhaps uploadify is
2011-07-12T14:33:05  <jarib> anyway, if you need to interact with the flash thing itself, externalInterface + executeScript is what you should look at
2011-07-12T14:33:16  *** hubc has quit IRC
2011-07-12T14:33:53  <antlong> actually
2011-07-12T14:33:53  <autojack> nope, with Flash disabled I just get no button at all.
2011-07-12T14:34:29  <antlong> you can probably inject the JS version on to the page then assign "$('#someID').uploadifyUpload()" to the div the flash button is in
2011-07-12T14:36:28  <autojack> where do you see the pure js version?
2011-07-12T14:37:14  <antlong> jquery.uploadify.v2.1.4.min.js
2011-07-12T14:37:16  <antlong> in the zip
2011-07-12T14:37:23  <autojack> looking...
2011-07-12T14:38:09  <antlong> boom

2011-07-12T14:39:17  <autojack> sorry, I don't understand...
2011-07-12T14:39:20  <autojack> what did you do?
2011-07-12T14:39:25  <antlong> look at the pictures
2011-07-12T14:39:49  <autojack> oh I see, you remove 'none' from display
2011-07-12T14:39:53  <autojack> and then you get the js version
2011-07-12T14:39:59  <autojack> intriguing.
2011-07-12T14:40:01  <antlong> its there the whole time, its just hidden
2011-07-12T14:40:10  <autojack> very clever, sir
2011-07-12T14:40:21  <antlong> now go forth young QAer
2011-07-12T14:40:49  <autojack> hmmmmmm
2011-07-12T14:40:58  <antlong> getAttribute
2011-07-12T14:41:00  <antlong> setAttribute
2011-07-12T14:41:04  <antlong> youll figure it out
2011-07-12T14:41:12  <autojack> just setAttribute to the path to my file?
2011-07-12T14:41:14  <antlong> :google webdriver set attribute
2011-07-12T14:41:23  <antlong> google webdriver set attribute
2011-07-12T14:41:24  <selbot> http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html
2011-07-12T14:41:30  <antlong> no
2011-07-12T14:41:53  <antlong> setAttribute display: [anything that isnt none];
2011-07-12T14:41:58  <autojack> ah right
2011-07-12T14:42:02  <antlong> then interact with the visible element
2011-07-12T14:42:02  <autojack> that'll get the box to appear.
2011-07-12T14:42:06  <autojack> right right
2011-07-12T14:42:15  <autojack> and call the js method to start the upload.
2011-07-12T14:42:18  <antlong> no
2011-07-12T14:42:24  <autojack> hm.
2011-07-12T14:43:35  <autojack> I don't see how the upload gets triggered now.
2011-07-12T14:43:43  <antlong> press enter
2011-07-12T14:43:58  <autojack> doesn't seem to do anything.
2011-07-12T14:44:12  <autojack> when I click Browse and choose a file, the path to the file appears in the text box now.
2011-07-12T14:44:15  <antlong> click on upload file
2011-07-12T14:44:23  <autojack> that isn't visible in our implementation
2011-07-12T14:44:26  <antlong> http://d.pr/lK8V
2011-07-12T14:44:30  <autojack> but I bet I can change that.,
2011-07-12T14:44:34  <antlong> then insert it in to the page
2011-07-12T14:44:35  <autojack> ours is set to auto-upload.
2011-07-12T14:44:37  <autojack> yeah
2011-07-12T14:44:42  <autojack> another attribute I guess.
2011-07-12T14:44:45  <antlong> right
2011-07-12T14:44:51  <antlong> set that to some div
2011-07-12T14:45:26  <antlong> or
2011-07-12T14:45:53  <autojack> couldn't I just tickle http://www.uploadify.com/documentation/methods/uploadifyupload/ somehow?
2011-07-12T14:46:21  <antlong> im not sure
2011-07-12T14:47:15  <autojack> need to figure out how that upload link gets enabled/disabled I guess.
2011-07-12T14:47:18  <antlong> well
2011-07-12T14:47:31  <antlong> in the JS tab you can profile the javascript
2011-07-12T14:47:39  <antlong> i would start there. see what happens when you use the form manually
2011-07-12T14:47:52  <autojack> OK
2011-07-12T14:47:53  <antlong> then figure out how youre going to mimic that behavior
2011-07-12T14:47:57  <autojack> right
2011-07-12T14:48:04  <antlong> alright good luck, quitting time here
2011-07-12T14:48:12  <autojack> cool. thanks a lot for the help :)

2011-07-12T14:55:08  <autojack> uhh
2011-07-12T14:55:21  <autojack> I see how I can get an attribute with the Ruby bindings, but I don't see how I can set one.
2011-07-12T14:56:41  <jarib> it's not part of the api
2011-07-12T14:56:58  <jarib> webdriver wasn't made to modify the DOM
2011-07-12T14:57:11  <jarib> you can through execute_script
2011-07-12T14:57:17  <autojack> ahh
2011-07-12T14:58:07  <autojack> <a href="javascript:$('#file_upload').uploadifyUpload()">Upload Files</a>  is what actually fires the upload
2011-07-12T14:58:30  <autojack> so I'm thinking I can just execute that once I give it a file.

2011-07-12T15:54:05  <__mike> __phil__ to get the text of the 'li' you can do something like driver.findElement( By.className("checked") ).getText()
2011-07-12T15:54:19  <__mike> you then need to get the contents of the href and do a .equals on that
2011-07-12T15:54:31  <__mike> let me see if i can find out how to get the text of the href
2011-07-12T15:55:19  <__mike> there is probably a reliable way to get the href element. look at what is available in the By class : http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/index.html

2011-07-12T18:21:05  <ian_mac> so I hope I'm not being a pain.  If I have a drop down menu, I assume I have to somehow do a mouseover to open the drop down first before clicking on the menu item link so that the element is visible, right?
2011-07-12T18:22:05  <ian_mac> ah and I use hover for that
2011-07-12T18:22:05  <ian_mac> cool

2011-07-12T21:11:40  <ian_mac> wow I feel like I'm slicing myself on the bleeding edge using webdriver
2011-07-12T21:11:52  <ian_mac> probably mostly learning curve though
2011-07-12T21:13:05  <autojack> have you used Selenium before?
2011-07-12T21:15:10  <ian_mac> yeah
2011-07-12T21:15:43  <ian_mac> used RC for quite a while and built a suite of tests
2011-07-12T21:16:08  <ian_mac> I like the new Webdriver API, I just think I've been lucky enough to hit the interesting issues
2011-07-12T21:16:49  <autojack> yeah same with me
2011-07-12T21:16:58  <autojack> I used RC for a year and then switched to WebDriver.
2011-07-12T21:17:10  <autojack> it has taken some getting used to
2011-07-12T21:17:13  <autojack> but seems good
2011-07-12T21:17:31  <ian_mac> I've just been struggling getting different results in different browsers

2011-07-12T21:20:30  <autojack> luckily at my current job we don't need to worry about other browsers
2011-07-12T21:21:23  <ian_mac> he
2011-07-12T21:23:17  <ian_mac> you use hover at all?  or mouseMove?
2011-07-12T21:25:57  <autojack> no, I've always been lucky not to actually need to simulate mouse actions.

2011-07-12T23:33:14  <selbot2> julianharty half a minute ago - JulianHarty: Minor edits to the WebDriver help pages. There's more to do e.g. the WebDriver jar files are no longer available as downloads from the site so we need to refer to current downloads e.g. selenium-java-2.0.0 - as the downloads are zipped we should explain how to unzip the files, add libs to the protected foldes, etc. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12907
