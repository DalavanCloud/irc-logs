But there are a couple of proxy-related startup options, although I've never personally used them.  Check out -avoidProxy, -Dhttp.proxyHost=...host..., and -Dhttp.proxyPort=...port...

2011-09-07T06:57:52  <davehunt> 1.1.0 though
2011-09-07T06:58:37  <adamgoucher> i just read a post on the new ui that is schedule around ff9; suspect it has impact on the plugin?
2011-09-07T07:00:48  <adamgoucher> and do you have an mozmill script that loads a user-extension in the options screen? (think i need that for the ui-element plugin scripts)

2011-09-07T07:10:38  <adamgoucher> from the firefox9 for developers page it looks like it hasnt landed
2011-09-07T07:10:45  <davehunt> oh yeah, that
2011-09-07T07:10:57  <davehunt> why would that break IDE?
2011-09-07T07:11:12  <adamgoucher> possible overlay points?
2011-09-07T07:11:26  <davehunt> I don't see why
2011-09-07T07:11:43  * adamgoucher is paraonoid
2011-09-07T07:11:48  <davehunt> We'll keep running the tests
2011-09-07T07:11:54  <davehunt> but we do need more tests...
2011-09-07T07:12:24  <adamgoucher> next monday i'll need help setting one up that loads a user-extension
2011-09-07T07:12:55  <davehunt> I still don't understand what you mean by loading a user-extension
2011-09-07T07:13:00  <davehunt> What do you want the test to do?
2011-09-07T07:13:59  <adamgoucher> in se-ide, the way you load the ui-map is though the options screen. once i create a script that uses the ui-map, want mozmill script that will open the options menu and load the ui-map
2011-09-07T07:14:24  <davehunt> well that's not a problem
2011-09-07T07:14:44  <adamgoucher> i wouldnt suspect it would be; i just havent done it yet :)
2011-09-07T07:14:47  <davehunt> although if you're splitting the ui-elements stuff out into a plugin then the test is for the plugin, not selenium IDE
2011-09-07T07:15:01  <davehunt> it just happens to require Selenium IDE to be installed
2011-09-07T07:15:03  <adamgoucher> correct
2011-09-07T07:16:01  <davehunt> This is possible, however it likely won't be in our daily testruns straight away, as I don't believe it's possible at the moment to set up per addon addon dependancies
2011-09-07T07:16:14  <davehunt> there's got to be a better way of saying that
2011-09-07T07:16:17  <davehunt> :)
2011-09-07T07:16:38  <adamgoucher> woudlnt be run as part of the main batch. i just want it nicely package with a bow so i can drop support for it and someone else can take it if they choose :)
2011-09-07T07:17:24  <davehunt> oh, running them in Bamboo wouldn't be a problem. I was talking about running them on our infrastructure
2011-09-07T07:17:52  <adamgoucher> i wouldnt even put it in bamboo
2011-09-07T07:21:08  <davehunt> fair enough

2011-09-07T08:25:56  <Dude-X> the project I am on doesn't use the page object class, but we do have classes that have the methods to interact on a page, so that in our test we just write _loginPage.enterUsername("user");
2011-09-07T08:26:41  <Dude-X> while the actual method would do the find element by xpath or (whatever is appropriate) then sendkeys, etc;
2011-09-07T08:26:56  <jqp> how is that approach not using the page object model?
2011-09-07T08:27:34  *** davehunt has quit IRC
2011-09-07T08:27:42  <Dude-X> i think there's actually a page object class in selenium that you can exploit; we do use a page model abstraction
2011-09-07T08:27:55  <jqp> my understanding of the page object model is that interactions with the page are abstracted away from the actual test classes, and put into "page object" classes to enable calls from the test like _loginPage.enterUsername("user")
2011-09-07T08:28:18  <jqp> oh, i wasn't aware of a built-in page object class
2011-09-07T08:28:36  <jqp> (i'm vaguely aware of Page Factory, though)
2011-09-07T08:28:57  <Dude-X> yeah there is Page Factory, which this project does not use.

2011-09-07T11:26:31  <Parabola> you don't tell it to run it on a specific node, you tell grid that you want, say Internet explorer 7
2011-09-07T11:26:43  <Parabola> and it will route the job to the first idle node that has IE7
2011-09-07T11:28:23  <Parabola> so in your code you'd tell your driver to give you IE version 7 with Capabilities
2011-09-07T11:29:20  <Parabola> and then on your node config you'd provide the launch options
2011-09-07T11:29:24  <Parabola> grid does the rest

2011-09-07T11:58:55  <jimevans> autojack: note that the answer you linked to needs to be updated, in that you need to use el.click() instead of el.select().

2011-09-07T12:01:28  <autojack> yeah I got a deprecation warning.
2011-09-07T12:01:55  <autojack> actually the warning was Selenium::WebDriver::Element#value is deprecated, please use Selenium::WebDriver::Element#attribute('value')
2011-09-07T12:02:02  <autojack> nothing related to select.
2011-09-07T12:03:02  <Ajay> which version are you using ?
2011-09-07T12:03:13  <autojack> of what, the ruby bindings?
2011-09-07T12:04:11  <Dude-X> sounds like he has an old rc version
2011-09-07T12:06:10  <algard> you should probably use Element#attribute('value')
2011-09-07T12:06:17  <algard> as the warning suggests ;)
2011-09-07T12:07:30  <autojack> hehe
2011-09-07T12:07:52  <autojack> yeah that just doesn't seem to be related to the click vs. select thing

2011-09-07T13:13:13  <dylans> adam: bin/pysaunter.py is intended to be the runner, right? it will activate py.test underneath the covers.
2011-09-07T13:13:34  <adamgoucher> dylans: also http://element34.ca/products/saunter/pysaunter
2011-09-07T13:13:47  <adamgoucher> don't use the git repo; get it through easy_install
2011-09-07T13:13:49  *** sdimkov has quit IRC
2011-09-07T13:14:22  <adamgoucher> (but yes, it uses py.test as its actual runner)
2011-09-07T13:14:43  <lord1234> can I have the same server configured as a grid member, but with 2 browsers on it?  For example, I have Chrome and Firefox on this machine(locally) can I call it a local member of the hub for both chrome and firefox but using a different port?
2011-09-07T13:15:38  *** andialbrecht is now known as andialbrecht_
2011-09-07T13:18:25  <dylans> cool. I made a new virtualenv, and easy_install of Saunter 0.6. I'll use the docs on http://element34.ca/products/saunter/pysaunter and check back with you later.
2011-09-07T13:19:38  <autojack> < jimevans> autojack: note that the answer you linked to needs to be updated, in that you need to use el.click() instead of el.select().
2011-09-07T13:19:57  <autojack> .click doesn't do what I want - it just pulls down the menu but doesn't select anything.
2011-09-07T13:20:04  <autojack> .select seems to work.
2011-09-07T13:20:25  <autojack> anyone know if this has changed in newer versions of the ruby bindings or something?
2011-09-07T13:21:10  <dylans> adamgoucher: eventually, if I base on Saunter, I'll need support for TeamCity service messages. I can work with you to see how best to provide that functionality.
2011-09-07T13:21:15  <dylans> adamgoucher: http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD65/Build+Script+Interaction+with+TeamCity#BuildScriptInteractionwithTeamCity-ReportingTests
2011-09-07T13:22:33  <adamgoucher> dylans: cool. i'll add that to the roadmap - http://cardmapping.com/maps/764
2011-09-07T13:22:34  <dylans> adamgoucher: This is the nose plugin code, which uses the old nose plugin api, but it does the job. http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TW/Python+Unit+Test+Reporting

2011-09-07T13:24:10  <dylans> adamgoucher: triggering the service message prints would be based on the existence of a TEAMCITY_PROJECT_NAME env var. I think I saw something similar in your code, for Jenkins integration.
2011-09-07T13:24:16  *** jfunk has quit IRC
2011-09-07T13:24:41  <adamgoucher> the jenkins stuff is just the ant xml format
2011-09-07T13:24:59  <dylans> ah ok. TC swallows that as well.
2011-09-07T13:25:21  <lord1234> what is the grid flag to specifiy max instances?
2011-09-07T13:25:53  <adamgoucher> dylans - it automagically gets generated into logs/latest.xml if it can slurp that in then you are golden
2011-09-07T13:26:03  *** nilian has quit IRC
2011-09-07T13:26:06  <dylans> but I like the immediate response I get from the service messages. It is sweet to see the passes/fail occur in the interface in real time. :)
2011-09-07T13:26:46  <adamgoucher> ooooo. i see. likely needs a py.test solution to be 'proper'
2011-09-07T13:27:13  <dylans> but slurping in the latest.xml will get the job done.
2011-09-07T13:27:20  <autojack> looks like I am ~10 versions behind on the gem

2011-09-07T15:12:32  <XRayCulver> i set it up so that if i have a db setup i dont want to repeat
2011-09-07T15:12:42  <XRayCulver> the steps only get run once per instance
2011-09-07T15:12:54  <XRayCulver> so it may be repeated across instances, but once per
2011-09-07T15:13:26  <XRayCulver> its not a performance increase for the smaller projects
2011-09-07T15:13:36  <XRayCulver> but with alot of longer tests its nice
2011-09-07T15:13:53  <lukeis> sounds like you've been busy ;)
2011-09-07T15:13:55  <XRayCulver> and if i want to do multi browsers, i just have my msbuild run the tests for each browser
2011-09-07T15:14:17  <XRayCulver> well run the tests on each browser
2011-09-07T15:14:21  <lukeis> sounds good
2011-09-07T15:14:22  <XRayCulver> yah
2011-09-07T15:14:31  <XRayCulver> huge improvement
2011-09-07T15:14:37  <XRayCulver> started exactly a year ago doing this
2011-09-07T15:14:41  <XRayCulver> learning on the fly
2011-09-07T15:14:47  *** freynaud_ has left #selenium
2011-09-07T15:14:48  <lukeis> i tell you about the everything is a "Module" framework that i'm using?
2011-09-07T15:14:54  <XRayCulver> no
2011-09-07T15:15:03  <XRayCulver> hows that owrk?
2011-09-07T15:15:05  <XRayCulver> *work?
2011-09-07T15:16:18  <lukeis> basically we create things that we call "Modules" and you can have a test run with any set of modules you want (defined by annotation above the test)... and WebDriver happens to be a module group which includes IE, FF, Chrome, etc.
2011-09-07T15:16:39  <lukeis> have modules for environments... since we have static ones (don't have to spin up the ones to test against)
2011-09-07T15:17:01  <lukeis> and modules for a few other things...

2011-09-07T15:17:05  <XRayCulver> ohh
2011-09-07T15:17:08  <XRayCulver> thats pretty cool
2011-09-07T15:17:10  <XRayCulver> i was just wondering
2011-09-07T15:17:14  <XRayCulver> what else the module defines
2011-09-07T15:17:15  <lukeis> but it's kind nice to just plug and play modules for a test
2011-09-07T15:17:32  <XRayCulver> module = environment for the page?
2011-09-07T15:17:36  <XRayCulver> like browser/os mainly?
2011-09-07T15:17:45  <lukeis> makes the effort on making discreet things to be re-used... and tests are simple use-cases :)
2011-09-07T15:18:43  <XRayCulver> definatly
2011-09-07T15:18:43  <lukeis> like one thing I can do is (Firefox, Chrome, StagingEnvironment, SomethingResource) and those get grouped together and run
2011-09-07T15:19:13  <XRayCulver> oh, thats easy
2011-09-07T15:19:16  <lukeis> automatically figures out the combinations of modules and spins up the necessary threads
2011-09-07T15:19:45  <XRayCulver> I like that
2011-09-07T15:20:06  <lukeis> i did too... it's using TestNG and Java though ;) not much help for you
2011-09-07T15:20:06  <XRayCulver> when i get to the point where i need more diverse environements i'll have to try that
2011-09-07T15:20:42  <XRayCulver> does every test get its own environment then?
2011-09-07T15:20:50  <lukeis> (co-worker open sourced it.... https://github.com/rexhoffman/test-extensions)
2011-09-07T15:20:52  <XRayCulver> or do they get re-used?
2011-09-07T15:21:02  <lukeis> we have static ones
2011-09-07T15:21:17  <lukeis> but i suppose we could make a module that would spin one up
2011-09-07T15:21:51  <lukeis> like i have a dev / stage / authoring / pre-production / production environments ... CMS tool

2011-09-07T17:49:49  <CakeProphet> I don't think I can, but maybe I can reproduce it.
2011-09-07T17:52:30  <CakeProphet> does each API have its own bug tracker os do I just use the main one?

2011-09-07T17:58:07  <CakeProphet> I believe that error occurs because I passed find_element_by_class_name a quoted string.
