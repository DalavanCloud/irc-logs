2011-09-27T05:41:47  <eyal83> well, I am trying to get watir to click on a specific button. Which is simple enough. The problem is, that when the button is not visible to me (in other words, I have to scroll down in order to see it) then it doesn't click on it...
2011-09-27T05:41:49  <eyal83> any advice?
2011-09-27T05:42:01  <RossPatterson> You're using the WebDriver API?

2011-09-27T05:42:41  <jimevans> which browser are you seeing the behaviour in?
2011-09-27T05:42:45  <eyal83> it doesn't...

2011-09-27T05:43:30  <eyal83> let me check if this happens with IE
2011-09-27T05:43:32  <AutomatedTester> eyal83: is it on the cusp of the view port?

2011-09-27T05:47:16  <AutomatedTester> is it on the edge of what is visible when the window is open?
2011-09-27T05:47:51  <eyal83> yeah, it's just underneath the horizontal scroll bar
2011-09-27T05:50:04  <lord1234> what does firebug say?  is it a visible element?

2011-09-27T05:55:42  <lord1234> jarib: i downgraded from 2.7 to 2.6 today.  I think that 2.7 has some issues with th efind_element.  Specifically the thing I discussed with you yesterday and a constant this.getWindow call I am seeing which fails.

2011-09-27T06:32:28  <webben> jimevans: I think the biggest barrier may be a lot of Selenium users don't have the frontend tech knowledge to be able to produce a simple bit of frontend code against which the problem can be reproduced.

2011-09-27T06:40:21  <jimevans> the biggest problem is the lack of the page under test. nobody seems to think that's important, or if they do, they feel that a portion of the page rather than the full page is enough.
2011-09-27T06:40:28  <webben> indeed
2011-09-27T06:40:55  <webben> there's also a lack of understanding that a page can vary over time (e.g. as Ajax-loaded component kick in)
2011-09-27T06:41:24  <lord1234_> jimevans: yes but I can't give out a login to a private webpage
2011-09-27T06:41:30  <jimevans> i have enough test harnesses lying about that i can plug a given snipped of selenium code into and run it, but without the page that displays the issue, it's next to useless.
2011-09-27T06:41:41  <lord1234_> and if I just cut and paste the source code, it probably a) will give too much info and b) probably not work the same.
2011-09-27T06:42:28  <webben> lord1234_: that's why you need to reduce it until it has no more info than necessary and shows the same problem
2011-09-27T06:42:30  <jimevans> lord1234_: then don't. create a separate page, one that doesn't relate to the actual page, but behaves similarly
2011-09-27T06:42:55  <lord1234_> right but I know ruby...not php/js/ajax that my devs use
2011-09-27T06:43:05  <lord1234_> and they won't take the time to work on my shit, they're busy enough.
2011-09-27T06:44:00  <RossPatterson> Annndddd .... that's the real problem.
2011-09-27T06:44:24  <jimevans> why does it have to be php? why do you have to use ajax? modulo synchronization problems, static html, sometimes with the appropriate javascript widget framework and css stylesheets are often enough to repro the issue.
2011-09-27T06:44:27  <webben> lord1234_: You don't need PHP, because PHP isn't relevant to your problem.
2011-09-27T06:44:43  <RossPatterson> I strongly suspect that most Selenium users are not strong enough in the technologies they interact with to be able to reduce a problem to a good test case.
2011-09-27T06:44:48  <webben> RossPatterson: Yes.
2011-09-27T06:44:55  <jimevans> sorry, that was unclear.
2011-09-27T06:45:00  <lord1234_> RossPatterson: yes.
2011-09-27T06:45:23  <RossPatterson> That doesn't absolve them from the responsibility to do so, though.
2011-09-27T06:45:24  <lord1234_> ross I completely agree with your statemant, and resemble it.
2011-09-27T06:45:31  <lord1234_> statement.
2011-09-27T06:46:09  <jimevans> with the exception of synchronization problems, static html with the appropriate css stylesheets and sometimes the appropriate javascript framework are often enough to repro.
2011-09-27T06:46:15  <jimevans> that's better.
2011-09-27T06:46:19  <webben> (You don't even generally need PHP or whatever for Ajax, since you can make Ajax requests to fetch updates from URLs that resolve to static resources.)
2011-09-27T06:46:43  <RossPatterson> jimevans and webben are right - one can usually reduce the problem to some static HTML and a few steps of test script.  Which is as close to sanitized as you'll ever get.
2011-09-27T06:47:31  <webben> It's perhaps also worth making the point that improving HTML + JS knowledge should help one write better tests.

2011-09-27T07:35:46  <eranm> I'd point out that getting started with the Android Driver is extremely easy because all you do is point a RemoteWebDriver to the URL of the server running on the device
2011-09-27T07:35:50  <jarib> in that case, why not do option 1 and move the proxy part out of the browser?
2011-09-27T07:36:39  <jarib> eranm: right, the challenge there is getting the emulator/device working ;)

2011-09-27T07:37:26  <AutomatedTester> so move the proxy to the client machine and have the test speak to that and then the browser poll the server for its next command

2011-09-27T07:45:22  <AutomatedTester> jarib: i agree but added that because I dont know the context of each call. The xpi would also help with the certificate handling and potential native events

2011-09-27T07:48:51  <jarib> only problem so far is that virtualbox isn't happy launching several VMs concurrently (at least not as the same user)

2011-09-27T07:53:16  <jimevans> re: fennic, i understand the reasoning behind option 2, but i think it might be hard to get right.
2011-09-27T07:53:49  <jimevans> of course, you're providing the server, rather than asking each language binding to implement like the old chrome driver used to, so that might be a moot point.
2011-09-27T07:55:46  <AutomatedTester> can we have paragraph 3 from http://vagrantup.com/faq.html on our site?
2011-09-27T07:55:58  <AutomatedTester> Vagrant would be better with Feature X
2011-09-27T07:56:09  *** jeichar has quit IRC
2011-09-27T07:56:33  <jarib> lord1234_: i don't see anything revealing there besides the last findElement call taking a long time.. which we knew already.
2011-09-27T07:56:59  <lord1234_> :(
2011-09-27T07:57:00  <jarib> lord1234_: is the page huge? what happens if you turn off native events?
2011-09-27T07:57:03  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: does the remote debugging protocol have to happen in process (from within an .xpi)?
2011-09-27T07:57:11  <lord1234_> the page does take a while to load
2011-09-27T07:57:17  <lord1234_> but that element is there(I can see it!) while it's loading
2011-09-27T07:57:22  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: not sure, still investigating
2011-09-27T07:57:29  <lord1234_> when it does work, it just sleeps over and over and over(i've watched taht happen too)
2011-09-27T07:57:33  <lord1234_> for some reason, sometimes it doesn't work!
2011-09-27T07:57:35  <jarib> jimevans: it wouldn't be very remote in that case :)
2011-09-27T07:57:42  <AutomatedTester> I think its on a separate process and I speak to it via sockets
2011-09-27T07:57:56  <jarib> lord1234_: the problem isn't loading the page - it's the call to find_element that is hanging for some reason
2011-09-27T07:58:02  <jimevans> if not, as jarib mentioned, you might be able to eliminate the XMLHttpRequest bits and talk directly to the device/remote debugger.
2011-09-27T07:58:31  <jimevans> (he said, not really thoroughly understanding the architecture yet)
2011-09-27T07:58:38  <lord1234_> any way to make it wait?  would explicit wait solve that?

2011-09-27T08:00:01  <lord1234_> anything to be done?

2011-09-27T08:00:48  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: np.
2011-09-27T08:02:58  <eranm> AutomatedTester, I'd be very happy to see a fennec driver. Having a driver available together with the first public release will allow other devs to verify their pages work with Fennec from day 1

2011-09-27T10:57:37  <adamgoucher> it means, if you need something set, like a gem path you need to set it yourself

2011-09-27T11:07:55  <lukeis> you can either do that or configure the node itself to have everything in the system path... i end up doing the latter for my team's jenkins... but the jenkins that services more than my team does the way adam is describing  (of course I'm taking about other things, not ruby gems)

2011-09-27T12:40:09  <jarib> and the plan at the moment is "dog slow but stable"
2011-09-27T12:40:26  <lord1234_> that your new builder?
2011-09-27T12:41:18  <jarib> it's the vagrant stuff, yeah

2011-09-27T12:53:46  <jimevans> kboers: the next step would be to find out what basic javascript using only HTML events would cause the jquery change() event to fire.
2011-09-27T12:55:15  <jarib> adamgoucher: ok, i set keep 20 and kill 3 months
2011-09-27T12:56:27  <jarib> adamgoucher: with the vagrant builds, all the repos are on the xserve directly, so should be plenty of space (it has a 1TB disk or similar)

2011-09-27T15:31:23  <rtyler> but all the useflu methods are on Bridge, but I don't know ho to get from one to the other o_O
2011-09-27T15:32:11  <jarib> rtyler: all the stuff in Bridge is available through Driver
2011-09-27T15:32:24  <rtyler> do you know /how/
2011-09-27T15:32:30  <jarib> what do you want to do?
2011-09-27T15:32:38  <jarib> :wiki rubybindings
2011-09-27T15:32:38  <selbot2> 1: RubyBindings: Ruby bindings - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RubyBindings
2011-09-27T15:32:59  <rtyler> yes, I've seen that, #getEval and #session_id didn't seem to be available
2011-09-27T15:33:32  <jarib> rtyler: read the Introduction on that wiki page ^
2011-09-27T15:33:41  <jarib> you're confusing two different modules.
2011-09-27T15:34:02  <jarib> Selenium::Client != Selenium::WebDriver
2011-09-27T15:34:55  <rtyler> right, I was referring to WebDriver
2011-09-27T15:35:07  <jarib> so if you're seeing getEval in the docs, you're looking at Selenium::Client
2011-09-27T15:35:39  <jarib> with webdriver you'd do driver.execute_script("return 1 + 1") #=> 2
2011-09-27T15:36:07  <rtyler> well, we're just getting started out with Selenium here (with Sauce), should we be sticking to WebDriver or just use the RC?
2011-09-27T15:36:10  * rtyler has used RC in the past
2011-09-27T15:36:32  <jarib> i can quote the wiki for you, if you want :)
2011-09-27T15:36:44  <rtyler> I grok the "those who are new" part
2011-09-27T15:37:04  <rtyler> but it looks like WebDriver is much dumber ("simple") than RC, to where I don't want to pidgeon-hole us down the road
2011-09-27T15:37:28  <RandLAT> From the homepage: "Selenium WebDriver is the successor of Selenium Remote Control which has been officially deprecated"
2011-09-27T15:37:47  <rtyler> ah
2011-09-27T15:37:59  <jarib> ok, the wiki page should really read "for those who don't have an existing investment in RC" instead of "those who are new"
2011-09-27T15:38:06  <rtyler> jarib: fair enough
2011-09-27T15:38:08  <jarib> i'll fix that
2011-09-27T15:38:11  *** jonathanrwallace has quit IRC
2011-09-27T15:38:49  <rtyler> jarib: are the methods off of the Remote::Bridge subclasses supposed to be available off of WebDriver?
2011-09-27T15:39:17  <rtyler> #session_id is what I need right now, but there's some other things (like #click) which I'll be needing shortly
2011-09-27T15:40:11  <rtyler> there's the @bridge instance variable inside of the WebDriver::Driver class AFAICT, but it's not accessible
2011-09-27T15:40:34  <jarib> why do you need the session_id ?
2011-09-27T15:40:56  <rtyler> to tie a nice big bow around sauce/selenium integration with our CI server ;)
2011-09-27T15:41:35  <rtyler> https://saucelabs.com/docs/ondemand#integration and https://saucelabs.com/docs/ondemand#rest, the session ID is needed to pass some end-of-test state back up to sauce
2011-09-27T15:41:37  <jarib> there's probably a simpler way to do it than mess with the internals
2011-09-27T15:41:49  * jarib reads
2011-09-27T15:42:09  <RandLAT> how is WebDriver different from the IDE?
2011-09-27T15:42:15  <jarib> *sigh*
2011-09-27T15:42:23  <rtyler> well there's spelling for one.
2011-09-27T15:42:25  <rtyler> xD
2011-09-27T15:43:55  <rtyler> jarib: I think I'm starting to grok how the API has been teased out in the WebDriver module
2011-09-27T15:44:18  *** jonathanrwallace has joined #selenium
2011-09-27T15:45:05  <rtyler> I am not to fond of the idea of using #execute_script to grab that sessionId from JS land, but it looks like past hardcoding references to Bridge classes, that's the only route
2011-09-27T15:45:09  <jarib> rtyler: ok, so sauce is encouraging this... to get the session_id you'll have to use driver.instance_variable_get("@bridge").instance_variable_get("@session_id")
2011-09-27T15:45:28  <rtyler> jinkeys scoob
2011-09-27T15:45:32  <rtyler> gnarly :)

2011-09-27T20:44:07  <adamgoucher> got told halfway through the month that the 30 hours i had available to bill morphed to 100. i'm doing my damnest to not watch month dissapear :)

2011-09-27T20:53:07  <adamgoucher> well, on the bright side, if you are going to be wiped out -- it might as well be in .au
