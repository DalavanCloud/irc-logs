2011-06-11T10:17:07  <rfx_> Never thought much about it; either the recorded xpath worked or I copied the path over from Firebug
2011-06-11T10:18:08  <rfx_> I just realized that 0.11 with the new CSS selectors didn't work with my RC 1.something because this RC doesn't know how to handle quoted attributes in CSS selectors. Had to manually fix them, but of course you only see this when the RC tasks on the server runs and not local ... :|
2011-06-11T10:40:56  <YuriKl> CSS is supposed to be faster
2011-06-11T10:41:27  <YuriKl> Though it can't do things like go to parent for example

2011-06-11T15:36:42  <JakeSays> hi
2011-06-11T16:07:29  <JakeSays> hey does anyone know if webdriver supports opening the browser with a fixed size?
2011-06-11T16:07:53  <avarus> documentation is great, right :P?
2011-06-11T16:08:16  <avarus> I was playing with selenium for two days now and it's not suitable for my use-case
2011-06-11T16:08:26  <JakeSays> avarus: whats your use case?
2011-06-11T16:08:37  <avarus> a complicated extjs web application
2011-06-11T16:08:49  <avarus> with awesome mess of ajax calls
2011-06-11T16:09:09  <avarus> and no, I don't know how to set the size of the window
2011-06-11T16:09:24  <JakeSays> ah extjs - i had the same experience last summer
2011-06-11T16:09:55  <JakeSays> tried selenium and webaii - neither were sufficient for extjs/ajax
2011-06-11T16:10:30  <avarus> I also like to run the "tests" without firefox showing up
2011-06-11T16:10:57  <avarus> tried htmlunit but fails miserably with "minified" js code :P
2011-06-11T16:11:00  <avarus> dunno why
2011-06-11T16:11:06  <avarus> also throws tons of errors
2011-06-11T16:11:18  <avarus> so I thought about firefoxdriver with firefox not showing
2011-06-11T16:11:37  <avarus> no idea how :P
2011-06-11T16:11:39  <JakeSays> avarus: i often wonder why people assume ajax code always modifies the dom - when it doesnt, waitfor*() fails miserably.
2011-06-11T16:12:17  <avarus> :)
2011-06-11T16:12:51  <JakeSays> avarus: well, this is disappointing. i was going to give writing tests for my extjs app another go.
2011-06-11T16:13:34  <avarus> I just expect the testers to test as they did before
2011-06-11T16:14:09  <avarus> I can't assume they know the inner workings so they can workaround selenium quirks
2011-06-11T16:16:57  <JakeSays> avarus: i agree
2011-06-11T16:17:48  <JakeSays> avarus: i'll probably go back to my original plan - customize chromedriver to provide the ajax primitives i need
2011-06-11T16:17:58  <avarus> :)
2011-06-11T16:18:43  <JakeSays> which will work fine for functional tests, but doesnt solve the problem for visual tests across browsers
2011-06-11T16:22:55  <jarib> JakeSays: executeScript("window.resizeTo(x,y)")
2011-06-11T16:23:13  <jarib> JakeSays: i'm curious how you would implement your "ajax primitives"
2011-06-11T16:23:57  <jarib> and what's the use case where XHRs doesn't modify the DOM but your tests still needs to wait for it?
2011-06-11T16:24:01  <jarib> that's very rare IME.
2011-06-11T16:25:33  *** nirvdrum has joined #selenium
2011-06-11T16:26:43  <JakeSays> jarib: background processing mostly, but even so there is still a lot of very complex ajax driven UI logic taking place that waitfor() just doesnt cut it.
2011-06-11T16:26:55  <jarib> i'd be curious to see an example
2011-06-11T16:27:16  <JakeSays> jarib: and my plan is to tap in to the inspector api
2011-06-11T16:27:17  <jarib> i've automated pretty complex JS apps and have yet to hit a wall with webdriver
2011-06-11T16:27:54  <JakeSays> my app is about 18,000 lines of js, and 80 lines of static html.
2011-06-11T16:28:05  <JakeSays> the entire UI is rendered client side.
2011-06-11T16:28:07  <jarib> sure
2011-06-11T16:28:33  <jarib> why is that a problem?
2011-06-11T16:29:12  <JakeSays> i could never get selenium to play well with it.
2011-06-11T16:29:21  <jarib> the webkit debugger protocol will let you know if there are any pending requests
2011-06-11T16:29:29  <jarib> most JS frameworks already expose that
2011-06-11T16:29:52  <jarib> and the actual rendering may take time as well
2011-06-11T16:30:38  <JakeSays> like, the user would press a button, which would perform an ajax request, then display a dialog, take some input, more ajax requests, etc, then close.
2011-06-11T16:30:49  <jarib> explicitly waiting for UI to be in the state needed has always worked well for me
2011-06-11T16:31:13  <JakeSays> i couldn't get selenium to react to the dialog opening
2011-06-11T16:31:25  <JakeSays> but this was over a year ago so things might be different now
2011-06-11T16:31:30  <jarib> react?
2011-06-11T16:31:44  <JakeSays> react as in waitfor(dialog open)
2011-06-11T16:32:14  <jarib> so it timed out waiting for the dialog to appear?
2011-06-11T16:32:23  <jarib> to be honest, sounds like a problem in your code.
2011-06-11T16:32:29  <JakeSays> if i remember right, yes
2011-06-11T16:33:12  <avarus> jarib, do you know a way to hide the firefox window? I have many cases where it's not needed to see the windows...in fact it's quite disturbing for many tests :D
2011-06-11T16:33:19  <avarus> window*
2011-06-11T16:34:01  <jarib> avarus: don't know, but in general that's a bad idea - firefox sometimes won't fire focus/blur events unless the windows is focused
2011-06-11T16:34:09  <avarus> ah ok
2011-06-11T16:34:17  <jarib> you should really use a VM for running tests if it's disturbing you
2011-06-11T16:34:32  <jarib> (i use virtualbox for this sometimes)
2011-06-11T16:34:43  <avarus> ya
2011-06-11T16:34:57  <avarus> or a dedicated pc
2011-06-11T16:35:10  <JakeSays> vm's are easier to automate
2011-06-11T16:35:29  <avarus> ok, vm running on a dedicated pc I mean :)
2011-06-11T16:35:36  <JakeSays> lol oh
2011-06-11T16:36:06  <avarus> you can't imagine how zend studio and firebug running the whole day can slow down even a very powerful machine
2011-06-11T16:36:12  <avarus> or perhaps you simply can imagine :P
2011-06-11T16:36:23  <JakeSays> firebug, yes.
2011-06-11T16:36:38  <JakeSays> zend.. is way too php for my tastes
2011-06-11T16:37:05  <avarus> well, the project I am working on is php and massive js :P
2011-06-11T16:37:25  <avarus> I hate zend studio but it's the way to go in that company
2011-06-11T16:38:09  <JakeSays> my next project might be php as well.. told my boss the only way i'd agree to it is if all the dynamic content was rendered client side, and php was used for nothing more than handling ajax requests.
2011-06-11T16:39:05  <avarus> I don't care (anymore) :P...I'm not changing the world
2011-06-11T16:40:13  <JakeSays> well, i'm only concerned about my world.

2011-06-11T16:40:46  <JakeSays> and in my world, server side dynamic content is a mortal sin.
2011-06-11T16:40:52  <CCulver> anybody know if jevans switched the .net code to vs2010?
2011-06-11T16:41:21  <JakeSays> CCulver: not sure exactly which .net code you're talking about, but i use vs2010 with webdriver
2011-06-11T16:41:37  <CCulver> the .net build solution
2011-06-11T16:41:54  <CCulver> he was going to migrate that from vs2008 to vs2010 for compiling the .net part
2011-06-11T16:41:57  <JakeSays> thats the one i'm building
2011-06-11T16:42:00  <avarus> JakeSays, the project I am working on has php classes that generate extjs code but that sounds too good...it's more a 1:1 translation...so you build php arrays that turn into config js arrays for extjs...that leads to big js functions inside php code :P
2011-06-11T16:42:32  <JakeSays> avarus: that just sounds dirty.
2011-06-11T16:42:49  <avarus> it is :P
2011-06-11T16:42:58  <avarus> but I don't care :)
2011-06-11T16:43:03  <avarus> it's too big to change :P
2011-06-11T16:43:19  <avarus> and I'm not paid for doing that anyways

2011-06-11T16:46:35  <CCulver> i was thinking you were memorizing release numbers
2011-06-11T16:46:35  <CCulver> hah
2011-06-11T16:46:57  <CCulver> *actually thinking there was no way you were memorizing them
2011-06-11T16:50:33  <jarib> ;)
2011-06-11T16:51:05  <jarib> that would be quite autistic if i did

2011-06-11T17:16:09  <JakeSays> jarib: so window.resizeTo() is the way to resize a browser window, eh?

2011-06-11T17:22:33  <JakeSays> jarib: that doesnt work
2011-06-11T17:23:37  *** rbalent has quit IRC
2011-06-11T17:24:22  <jarib> JakeSays: works fine here
2011-06-11T17:24:36  <jarib> (in Firefox 4)
2011-06-11T17:24:46  <JakeSays> i'm using chromium
2011-06-11T17:25:11  <jarib> ok, perhaps they don't support it
2011-06-11T17:25:52  <JakeSays> hmm.
2011-06-11T17:26:35  <jarib> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2091
2011-06-11T17:27:45  <avarus> lol @comments :)
2011-06-11T17:27:59  <avarus> the chromium guy should work here :P
2011-06-11T17:28:08  <avarus> "not a bug, supposed be like that"
2011-06-11T17:29:58  <avarus> chrome asks me if I really want to execute a given java applet...could be "copied" for that case as well
2011-06-11T17:30:16  <avarus> I believe even firefox asked that at some point
2011-06-11T17:30:22  <avarus> when a script wanted to resize the window
2011-06-11T17:30:27  <avarus> dunno anymore :)
2011-06-11T17:31:08  <JakeSays> wow
2011-06-11T17:31:44  <JakeSays> i can see not supporting resizeTo for web sites, but it really messes up testing
2011-06-11T17:31:58  <avarus> it simply has to be an option you can set
2011-06-11T17:32:32  <JakeSays> might make sense to add it to chromedriver (since chromedriver has access to window handles it would be fairly easy to implement)

2011-06-11T17:37:33  <avarus> "Talking to the Chrome developers is like talking to yourself." :D
2011-06-11T17:37:42  <avarus> "Except that you don't always get a vicious and dismissive answer when you talk to yourself." <-- lol :P
2011-06-11T17:38:50  <JakeSays> lol
2011-06-11T17:39:09  <JakeSays> generally speaking i have pretty good luck with the chromium devs.

2011-06-11T17:52:09  <avarus> I commented on that
2011-06-11T17:52:14  <avarus> on the bug report
2011-06-11T17:52:59  <avarus> resizeTo is vendor specific and not part of ecma but I still think it has to be an option :P
2011-06-11T17:55:24  <avarus> good night :)
2011-06-11T17:55:32  <avarus> happy testing

2011-06-11T18:14:13  <JakeSays> is there a facility in webdriver for adding browser specific commands?
2011-06-11T18:14:24  <JakeSays> or do i just start hacking away
2011-06-11T18:16:20  <JakeSays> hmm. i'm guessing there isnt

2011-06-11T20:07:56  <JakeSays> so i've been trying to figure this out - if i'm just using webdriver, do i need any of the selenium projects (visual studio projects)
