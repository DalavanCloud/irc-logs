2011-03-27T21:25:13  <rajan> Hi all, I am relatively new in selenium test, need some help in fileupload test ( firefox )
2011-03-27T21:26:12  <rajan> I tried attachFile( 'fieldLocator', 'filepath' ) but it looks file only taking file from 'tmp' dir
2011-03-27T21:27:34  <rajan> ie attachFile( 'fieldLocator', 'file:///tmp/filename.txt' );  --- this works but  attachFile( 'fieldLocator', 'file:///home/rajan/dir1/filename.txt' ); --- this doesn't works :(
2011-03-27T21:30:25  <rajan> I did lots of try out ( on my ubuntu ), but nothing works for me. BTW I am using 'SeleniumRC/selenium-server-1.0.3'.

2011-03-27T22:08:30  <rajan> Please, anyone?
