2011-03-10T02:22:49  <Richlv> as suggested by antlong yesterday, i ended up with something like this (in php) :

2011-03-10T06:32:35  <jarib> that's not bad, IMO
2011-03-10T06:32:49  <jarib> how would you design it?
2011-03-10T06:32:59  <AutomatedTester> dunno how I would design it
2011-03-10T06:33:11  <AutomatedTester> but I am lazy so thats a lot of typing
2011-03-10T06:33:27  <AutomatedTester> :)
2011-03-10T06:33:36  <AutomatedTester> it is a good feature though
2011-03-10T06:33:38  <jarib> you'd still have to type it into the issue form
2011-03-10T06:33:46  <jarib> more or less
2011-03-10T06:33:57  <jarib> i'm lovin' it.

2011-03-10T06:34:32  <jarib> copy and paste just makes you a slow typer :)
2011-03-10T06:34:39  <AutomatedTester> my jaw dropped
2011-03-10T06:35:20  <AutomatedTester> any idea if that feature is in github?
2011-03-10T06:35:36  <jarib> i know they have it for closing issues
2011-03-10T06:36:00  <jarib> but i don't think for updates/opening new ones
2011-03-10T06:36:03  <Richlv> adamgoucher, thanks. if 'a' is included in 'li' would a check that 'li' contains href also work ?
2011-03-10T06:36:13  <AutomatedTester> yea I know that, which is handy otherwise I would fotget to close pull requests
2011-03-10T06:36:23  <Richlv> because that seemed to be the first version which did not match
2011-03-10T06:36:59  <adamgoucher> Richlv: ya, thats why it didnt work. <li class="bunch of classes" href="foo> isnt legal html
2011-03-10T06:37:19  <jarib> AutomatedTester: i think pull requests are automatically closed when you push the commits
2011-03-10T06:37:37  <AutomatedTester> jarib: they are, thats what i was meaning ^
2011-03-10T06:37:47  <AutomatedTester> pull requests create an issue too :)
2011-03-10T06:37:56  <Richlv> adamgoucher, ok, so <li><a href></a></li> would not be matched by "contains href" on li ?
2011-03-10T06:38:48  <adamgoucher> Richlv: that construct would need //li/a[contains(@href, 'foo')]
2011-03-10T06:39:48  <Richlv> adamgoucher, thanks again. so my interpretation would be that 'contains' looks only inside that tag we're checking and not in nested tags :)
2011-03-10T06:40:04  * Richlv proceeds with some test to get php devs fix one bug =)
2011-03-10T06:40:26  <rethus> if i enter data with a testcase in my textfields, and start the selenium-testcase, the tooltip-boxes doesn't close anymore. any idea why: http://www.erfolgsbeginn.de/basis/front_content.php?idart=34
2011-03-10T06:40:36  <adamgoucher> Richlv: correct. contains/starts-with/ends-with/etc only work on the specific element, there is no inheritance/cascading
2011-03-10T06:40:48  <AutomatedTester> think its ok to say Selenium is good way to create tests but is abused by testers and developers?
2011-03-10T06:41:05  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: most certainly is ok
2011-03-10T06:41:12  <AutomatedTester> sweet

2011-03-10T07:12:32  <jimevans> there are still bugs in the common interactions code, so i'd left them ignored for all browsers in .NET.

2011-03-10T07:13:51  <jimevans> Funny thing is, I didn't touch any of the interactions code. Doesn't mean somebody else didn't.

2011-03-10T07:29:32  <AutomatedTester> its the 4th most used language in the world
2011-03-10T07:29:53  <AutomatedTester> according to Tiobe
2011-03-10T07:30:14  <jarib> although to be honest, i have sometimes reflected that a statically typed language may be more suitable for slow tests, since runtime errors after running for several minutes can be very frustrating
2011-03-10T07:30:25  <jarib> i don't admit that very often though.

2011-03-10T08:16:13  <simonstewart> hi
2011-03-10T08:17:06  <jimevans> the issue is that the test now uses the interactions api to simulate the hover. when i try that in the .NET bindings, it complains that the moveto command is unknown.
2011-03-10T08:17:19  <simonstewart> odd
2011-03-10T08:18:18  <simonstewart> Though hover used to have a different URL
2011-03-10T08:18:24  <simonstewart> IIRC
2011-03-10T08:18:47  <jimevans> yeah, it did. it was /session/:sessionid/element/:id/hover.
2011-03-10T08:19:30  <jimevans> i'm just wondering if the java test passes for firefox. it doesn't seem to be ignored for firefox.

2011-03-10T10:18:01  *** kpiwko has quit IRC
2011-03-10T10:19:19  <RossPatterson> Richlv: Your original XPath meant "select the INPUT element with value=Unlink that is contained within the DIV element with class='dd' that is contained within the DIV element that contains 'Linux'".  As you've seen, that's not what your HTML actually is, which is why it didn't match.
2011-03-10T10:20:41  <RossPatterson> Richlv: Your second version means "select the INPUT element with value=Unlink that is contained within a DIV element that is a sibling of the DIV element that contains 'Linux'".  That makes a world of difference.
2011-03-10T10:24:13  <RossPatterson> Richlv: Note that "div[whatever]/../div" means any DIV that is a sibling of the first DIV.  It does not mean the DIV immediately following the first DIV.

2011-03-10T12:02:28  <jimevans> passing the atoms in as a string to be eval'd is going to be a royal pain.

2011-03-10T12:06:22  <adamgoucher> my first attempt was to try css using ~ but i would need more complex order of operations than just left-to-right
2011-03-10T12:09:22  <simonstewart> jimevans? Eh?
2011-03-10T12:09:54  *** AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
2011-03-10T12:10:09  <jimevans> I was trying to figure out how I was going to "eval" the js code.
2011-03-10T12:10:40  <jimevans> in particular, the atoms code was going to be problematic, since there were all sorts of escaped double and single quotes.
2011-03-10T12:11:18  <jimevans> then i realized that I didn't need to use eval at all; everything we attempt to evaluate is already wrapped in an anonymous function anyhow.
2011-03-10T12:12:07  <jimevans> when I use execScript, i assign the result of the anonymous function execution to a variable, instead of trying to eval it there.
2011-03-10T12:12:21  <jimevans> i think. :)
2011-03-10T12:16:36  <RossPatterson> adamgoucher: I recently had a CSS-bigot try to disabuse me of the CSS-can't-go-up-the-tree claim.  He asserted that by using "/../", I was thinking too much like a command line geek and not enough like a document geek.  He might even have been right.
2011-03-10T12:17:45  <adamgoucher> i've used + and ~ with some success, but there comes a point where you need to fall back on ..
2011-03-10T12:19:11  <RossPatterson> adamgoucher: His point was that instead of thinking "How do I walk the tree from element A to element B?", think of "How do I describe the relative positions of points A and B within a multually enclosing element C?"
2011-03-10T12:19:20  <adamgoucher> i would love to have said css=(.plans-column-top img[alt^=INTRO]) ~ a.plans-signup-buitton but that breaks how css works
2011-03-10T12:20:13  <RossPatterson> Your example doesn't have enough info to do that, though, because the second DIV is a sibling of something higher up the tree than the first DIV.
2011-03-10T12:20:26  * adamgoucher is using this as a teachable moment with the client on 'from now on you will put meaningful ids on anything that can be interacted with or contains text we might care about

2011-03-10T12:39:06  *** AutomatedTester has quit IRC
2011-03-10T12:39:37  <Richlv> antlong, adamgoucher - just "//input[@value='Unlink']" wouldn't do because the page may have almost unlimited amount of unlinks
2011-03-10T12:40:09  <antlong> if you know which indice then you can do (//input[@value="Unlink"])[1]
2011-03-10T12:40:33  <Richlv> < RossPatterson> Richlv: Note that "div[whatever]/../div" means any DIV that is a sibling of the first DIV.  It does not mean the DIV immediately following the first DIV.
2011-03-10T12:41:10  <Richlv> oh damn. so that would match any div "on the same level" ? would it only match divs following or also preceding the div in the first specification ?
2011-03-10T12:41:17  <antlong> its literally, div/div[whatever]
2011-03-10T12:41:26  <antlong>  /.. means go down 1 level
2011-03-10T12:41:50  <antlong> simonstewart, http://d.pr/Y0T4
2011-03-10T12:42:16  <Richlv> regarding multiple unlinks, no, i have no idea which it might be in the list (list is linked templates, so it can vary a lot) - the only thing that matters is unlink next to specific template name, which at least seems to match so far
2011-03-10T12:42:40  <Richlv> although that thing about "siblings" makes me wonder whether that xpath is guaranteed to match the correct unlink...
2011-03-10T12:42:54  <Richlv> would it always get next matching div or not really ?
2011-03-10T12:43:18  <simonstewart> You can configure a firefox profile to always save content to a known location
2011-03-10T12:43:24  <antlong> simonstewart, what about with g chrome?
2011-03-10T12:43:30  <simonstewart> nope
2011-03-10T12:43:33  <antlong> fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
2011-03-10T12:43:44  <simonstewart> That's software for you
2011-03-10T12:43:44  <Richlv> i could try testing that, but i don't think results would give me 100% confidence
2011-03-10T12:44:03  <antlong> Richlv, anything that can happen...
2011-03-10T12:44:31  <antlong> simonstewart, and that modal is out of reach of pure js also, right?

2011-03-10T12:45:30  <jimevans> is jquery busted in ie9?
2011-03-10T12:47:40  <simonstewart> right
2011-03-10T12:48:53  *** kylls has quit IRC
2011-03-10T12:48:55  <AutomatedTester> http://swarm.jquery.org/ <- looks like nothing is attached atm
2011-03-10T12:49:39  <Richlv> antlong, heh, that's why understanding how that "siblingy" thing is supposed to work might be useful :)
2011-03-10T12:49:40  <jimevans> found the problem. our drag-drop test page is using jquery-ui 1.8.1
2011-03-10T12:50:42  <antlong> Richlv, but the results can change depending on many things, like siblings with same name / lookup that is too insensitive, things like that.
2011-03-10T12:51:32  <simonstewart> jimevans: yes it is
2011-03-10T12:51:35  <simonstewart> And that's borked?
2011-03-10T12:51:37  <simonstewart> *sigh*
2011-03-10T12:51:42  <simonstewart> So the problems appear to be:
2011-03-10T12:51:51  <simonstewart> 1) Can't execute JS on a page without a running script engine
2011-03-10T12:51:54  <simonstewart> 2) JQuery
2011-03-10T12:52:15  <simonstewart> google jquery ie 9
2011-03-10T12:52:16  <selbot`> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-does-not-work-on-ie9
2011-03-10T12:52:19  <jimevans> well the jquery problem is a jquery bug. it's fixed in 1.8.6, i think
2011-03-10T12:52:21  <Richlv> antlong, i guess in this case it boils down to whether it always grabs first following sibling or not
2011-03-10T12:52:32  <simonstewart> Apparently
2011-03-10T12:52:42  <antlong> Richlv, yeah which you could force with an indice.
2011-03-10T12:52:56  <jimevans> i'm trying a later jquery now

2011-03-10T13:36:02  <jimevans> in the .NET tests, that is.
2011-03-10T13:36:14  <jimevans> which are fairly comparable to the Java ones.

2011-03-10T13:41:45  <jimevans> simonstewart: I've got one in UploadTest, which is purely a js failure (we verify by finding an element via xpath).
