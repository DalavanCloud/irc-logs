2011-03-11T02:55:51  <AutomatedTester> Zs: ask the question and see if you get a reply is the best approach
2011-03-11T02:56:27  <Zs> ah, allright I did not no the process:) thanks for the heads up.
2011-03-11T02:57:08  <aikie> what's the best way to make a selenium java test wait for a certain amount of time before continuing the test?
2011-03-11T03:00:09  <Zs> I am using Selenium Server, and I would like to reuse, continue a selenium session. I am debugging my tests, so I want to rerun it, but without remaking the initialization steps. Basicaly 1, set up a browser with init state, 2, run test1 which uses that set-up-browser, 3, run test1-changed
2011-03-11T03:00:43  <Zs> 4, run test1-with other changes still reusing the first session
2011-03-11T03:00:50  <Zs> Can this be done??
2011-03-11T03:05:48  <AutomatedTester> Zs: run the Jar with --help and have a look
2011-03-11T03:05:56  <AutomatedTester> there is an option for session reuse
2011-03-11T03:06:07  <AutomatedTester> aikie: what are you waiting for
2011-03-11T03:06:22  <AutomatedTester> e.g an element on the page?
2011-03-11T03:06:22  <Zs> yes
2011-03-11T03:06:25  <Zs> i do that
2011-03-11T03:06:27  <AutomatedTester> or just some time to pass
2011-03-11T03:06:45  <Zs> -browserSessionReuse is checked
2011-03-11T03:07:36  <Zs> selenium server maintans the session between runs, if the session isn't closed, that is true no?
2011-03-11T03:08:22  <aikie> just some time to pass
2011-03-11T03:08:23  <AutomatedTester> Zs: not sure, I don't like preserving sessions like that
2011-03-11T03:08:46  <AutomatedTester> aikie: Thread.sleep(timeInMilliseconds)
2011-03-11T03:09:13  <aikie> perfect, thanks!
2011-03-11T03:12:58  <Zs> so when you have a complex operation, and a newly written test after that. you rerun the complex operation every time?
2011-03-11T03:13:41  <Zs> to be clear: I am not performing the test, I am building the test, which will perform the test. So waiting for the automated steps to finish, i an issue
2011-03-11T03:35:47  <AutomatedTester> Zs: what is a complex operation
2011-03-11T03:36:16  <AutomatedTester> Zs: if you reuse the session you cant scale the test into grid
2011-03-11T03:37:59  <Zs> complex, i mean: open browser, login, navigate in the application, create some application elements
2011-03-11T03:38:20  <Zs> nobody gets, what I am trying to say.
2011-03-11T03:38:44  <AutomatedTester> Zs: you can do class level setups in your tests
2011-03-11T03:38:57  <AutomatedTester> that can do the browser start and the logins
2011-03-11T03:39:03  <Zs> AutomatedTester: yes
2011-03-11T03:39:09  <Zs> but that will run every time\
2011-03-11T03:39:11  <Zs> no?
2011-03-11T03:39:16  <Zs> when I run my test
2011-03-11T03:39:35  <Zs> i want to maintain it between runs, to do the login just once
2011-03-11T03:39:39  <AutomatedTester> do you want to attach  a browser to a session?
2011-03-11T03:39:54  <Zs> what do you mean by that?
2011-03-11T03:40:10  <AutomatedTester> browser open and then have selenium use the open r
2011-03-11T03:40:10  <AutomatedTester> 
2011-03-11T03:40:14  <AutomatedTester> browser
2011-03-11T03:40:25  <Zs> yes, selenium shoud use the opened browser
2011-03-11T03:40:35  <AutomatedTester> you cant do that with selenium
2011-03-11T03:40:47  <Zs> but if selenium opened it
2011-03-11T03:41:06  <AutomatedTester> then you need to tell selenium not to close it
2011-03-11T03:41:15  <Zs> yes, I am telling it
2011-03-11T03:41:29  <AutomatedTester> have a singleton that maintains the browser and your tests poll the singleton
2011-03-11T03:41:55  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-03-11T03:42:50  <Zs> how do you write your tests AutomatedTester? what do you do when your test has an error? you rerun everuthing from the beginning?
2011-03-11T03:45:57  <AutomatedTester> yes
2011-03-11T03:47:52  <AutomatedTester> Zs: my tests dont rely on anything but themselves
2011-03-11T03:48:05  <AutomatedTester> and the setup, which starts the browser
2011-03-11T03:48:15  <AutomatedTester> but its a method level setup

2011-03-11T05:27:42  <jimevans> I don't think it's an exaggeration to say I'm probably the biggest fan that MSFT has in the Selenium community, but the lack of direct engagement by the company is discouraging.
2011-03-11T05:28:02  <AutomatedTester> i like MSFT
2011-03-11T05:28:21  <AutomatedTester> they make the odd mistake but always bounce back
2011-03-11T05:30:09  <jimevans> In liking (as opposed to merely tolerating) MSFT, I think we're in the minority among Selenium users, David.
2011-03-11T05:30:20  <jimevans> But I could be wrong.

2011-03-11T05:32:51  <AutomatedTester> They are no "Godzilla of search engines"
2011-03-11T05:33:19  <AutomatedTester> apparently, shocked me this, Mozilla wont file an IPO
2011-03-11T05:34:56  <jimevans> I do enjoy C# over Java quite a bit. Thought they solve the same problems in similar ways, I just think it's a bit more elegant.
2011-03-11T05:35:26  <jimevans> What's the business case for Mozilla filing an IPO? Do they need to generate cash?
2011-03-11T05:35:32  *** zmijunkie has quit IRC
2011-03-11T05:38:23  <jimevans> other than, of course, hopefully making their current stockholders (employees?) happier.

2011-03-11T05:41:51  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: no, we dont have a cash issue, just watched an interview with Mozilla CEO and Fox Business news
2011-03-11T05:42:28  <AutomatedTester> firstly the news person called Mozilla the "Godzilla of Search Engines"
2011-03-11T05:42:46  <jimevans> Yeah, that's funny to me too.
2011-03-11T05:42:59  <AutomatedTester> and then asked if we would file an IPO, asking a non-profit if we will file an IPO
2011-03-11T05:43:56  <AutomatedTester> Mozilla doesnt appear to struggle to make money
2011-03-11T05:44:12  <jimevans> Well, there is the matter of the difference between the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation. I suppose you could IPO the corporation.
2011-03-11T05:45:35  <AutomatedTester> there is but if we did an IPO we would never stay objective to things happening on the net
2011-03-11T05:45:43  <AutomatedTester> we would be doing it for our shareholders
2011-03-11T05:46:02  <jimevans> Oh, I agree there.
2011-03-11T05:46:26  <AutomatedTester> in 2009 Mozilla made $104 million
2011-03-11T05:46:42  <AutomatedTester> not bad for a company of ~250 employees

2011-03-11T07:06:53  <eoin_> anyone know any plans for selenium supporting FF4
2011-03-11T07:08:34  <adamgoucher> which part? but yes, there is support for it
2011-03-11T07:09:05  <simonstewart> eoin_: 2.0b3 will support it
2011-03-11T07:09:13  <simonstewart> b2 works pretty well with it already
2011-03-11T07:09:20  <eoin_> oh sorry, got FF RC 4 and it says not supported

2011-03-11T07:12:15  <simonstewart> hi
2011-03-11T07:12:51  <watchick> I have a problem with Selenium, and i would appreciate a little help, when i make some test and then i choose some format (phyton). Then "Table" panel is disabled and i cannot click at it...
2011-03-11T07:13:07  <watchick> i tryied everything... creating new test and stuff...
2011-03-11T07:13:42  <watchick> i seriously deleted my whole temp files for FF than i got one more shot. When i did it again it did the same thing
2011-03-11T07:14:24  <watchick> can somebody help me with this please?
2011-03-11T07:19:46  <watchick> anyone?
2011-03-11T07:19:50  <AutomatedTester> watchick: there was a number of complaints about people moving to another format and then trying to come back
2011-03-11T07:19:58  <AutomatedTester> so it was disabled
2011-03-11T07:20:20  <simonstewart> Wow. Japan sounds bad
2011-03-11T07:20:50  <adamgoucher> theres some spooky videos on cnn.com of the tsunami taking out towns etc.
2011-03-11T07:20:50  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: I saw the tsunami on BBC this morning... OH MY GOD!
2011-03-11T07:21:24  <adamgoucher> the radio said this earthquake was 8000 times stronger than the christchurch one last month
2011-03-11T07:21:42  <simonstewart> 8.9 on the richter scaler

2011-03-11T07:38:40  <adamgoucher> seems like the new jquery is causing people grief
2011-03-11T07:39:04  <adamgoucher> or as least from the stoopid twitter chain mail stuff going on
2011-03-11T07:39:31  <simonstewart> Hmmm.... why do I think that there's an antiquated version of jquery i the htmlutils.js file?
2011-03-11T07:39:59  <simonstewart> It's because there is one
2011-03-11T07:40:07  <simonstewart> 1.4.1

2011-03-11T07:51:11  * simonstewart bangs head repeatedly on desk
2011-03-11T07:52:03  <jimevans> i just updated a version of jQuery this morning, but only for the test webpages that require it ($/common/src/web).
2011-03-11T07:52:09  <simonstewart> Right
2011-03-11T07:52:21  <simonstewart> I'm going to understand this code before I rip it out
2011-03-11T07:53:08  <jimevans> on the plus side, i've got only one unexpected/unexplained failure in the .net tests for ie9.
2011-03-11T07:53:26  <simonstewart> really?
2011-03-11T07:53:29  <simonstewart> That's amazing
2011-03-11T07:53:35  *** ner0x has joined #selenium
2011-03-11T07:53:43  <jimevans> yeah, but the one failure is really disturbing.
2011-03-11T07:53:49  <simonstewart> go on?
2011-03-11T07:54:00  <jimevans> it's in the file uploading test.
2011-03-11T07:54:07  <simonstewart> hanging sometimes?
2011-03-11T07:54:28  <jimevans> no, not really. what happens is that we have a page with an iframe, and a form that submits the file to be uploaded.
2011-03-11T07:54:41  <jimevans> for verifictation, we look for the body tag in the iframe page.
2011-03-11T07:54:50  <simonstewart> so far so good
2011-03-11T07:55:00  <jimevans> but we look for the body tag via xpath.
2011-03-11T07:55:12  <jimevans> and for some reason, the xpath engine injection is failing.
2011-03-11T07:55:30  <simonstewart> no script engine on the page?
2011-03-11T07:55:41  <jimevans> if I have the dev console up, I can see where we get an error like "expected ';'"
2011-03-11T07:55:53  *** zmijunkie has quit IRC
2011-03-11T07:56:03  <simonstewart> how odd
2011-03-11T07:56:10  <jimevans> the confusing thing is that this is the *only* place where this error appears.
2011-03-11T07:56:28  <jimevans> other methods that find by xpath work fine.
2011-03-11T07:57:23  <simonstewart> That doesn't make a huge amount of sense
2011-03-11T07:57:39  <simonstewart> What's the test?
2011-03-11T07:57:44  <jimevans> i agree, which is why i've been banging my head on my desk all morning too.
2011-03-11T07:58:33  <simonstewart> Have you tried swapping in an un-minimized version of the xpath engine?
2011-03-11T07:59:12  <jimevans> in .net it's OpenQA.Selenium.UploadTest.ShouldAllowFileUploading. the corresponding Java test would be org.openqa.selenium.UploadTest.testFileUploading
2011-03-11T07:59:53  <jimevans> I've not yet tried an un-minimized version yet.
2011-03-11T08:00:05  <jimevans> i'll give it a shot.
2011-03-11T08:00:06  <simonstewart> That xpath looks fine
2011-03-11T08:00:35  <jimevans> yeah, it's about as simple as you could get.

2011-03-11T08:02:29  <simonstewart> OK. So jquery is quite dense
2011-03-11T08:03:51  <jimevans> simonstewart: the change that we made to jsxpath in r10401, did it get ported back to the source library trunk?

2011-03-11T08:04:05  <simonstewart> I think so
2011-03-11T08:04:23  <jimevans> ok, let me go exploring.
2011-03-11T08:05:33  <simonstewart> Stopping the yak shaving: this jquery issue isn't why the browser's not starting
2011-03-11T08:07:04  <jimevans> apparently not. http://svn.coderepos.org/share/lang/javascript/javascript-xpath/trunk/release/javascript-xpath-latest-cmp.js omits our change.

2011-03-11T08:10:11  <jimevans> :) clever, that. I caught the typo, just needed to finish the thought.
2011-03-11T08:12:14  <jimevans> simonstewart: remind me again why we don't compile the javascript-xpath library ourselves?
2011-03-11T08:12:45  <simonstewart> I'm not sure
2011-03-11T08:12:55  <simonstewart> Because they already ship a minimized version>
2011-03-11T08:12:58  <simonstewart> ?
2011-03-11T08:14:05  <simonstewart> And it's possible that the jscompiler may choke on it
2011-03-11T08:14:22  <jimevans> okay, I'll buy either of those reasons. :)
2011-03-11T08:14:38  <simonstewart> Laziness don't enter into it
2011-03-11T08:15:25  <jimevans> i'm sure.

2011-03-11T08:41:06  <simonstewart> hadanza!
2011-03-11T08:41:07  <bcave> haha
2011-03-11T08:41:31  <bcave> to the technicalities....
2011-03-11T08:42:16  <simonstewart> ok
2011-03-11T08:42:27  <bcave> im busy designing a test framework, using selenium... i want to run a quick test after deploying a web app....
2011-03-11T08:42:40  <bcave> the best thing to do would be to use the WebDriver?
2011-03-11T08:43:08  <simonstewart> That's what I'd say
2011-03-11T08:43:22  <adamgoucher> but its more of a 'it depends' answer
2011-03-11T08:43:24  <bcave> so create the tests using a test framework, and package it...
2011-03-11T08:43:38  <bcave> it always depends :)
2011-03-11T08:44:12  <bcave> i basically want to verify basic UI components of the web app, and generate test reports
2011-03-11T08:44:16  <simonstewart> adamgoucher: it increasingly depends less :)
2011-03-11T08:44:58  <adamgoucher> depends on your measuring stick the depends depth :)
2011-03-11T08:45:07  <bcave> i used to use SeleneseTestCase, the last time i used selenium, which was probably about 18 months ago
2011-03-11T08:45:15  <antlong> bcave, what language would you be looking to use for this
2011-03-11T08:45:21  <bcave> java
2011-03-11T08:45:33  <simonstewart> bcave: I'd just use JUnit 4 these days
2011-03-11T08:45:37  <bcave> yeah
2011-03-11T08:45:51  <antlong> ew man
2011-03-11T08:45:55  <bcave> so set up the webdriver in a test case
2011-03-11T08:45:57  <antlong> jerry springer is going hard these days

2011-03-11T08:48:56  *** dave_miles_cf has joined #selenium
2011-03-11T08:49:09  <simonstewart> Why not use a @Rule or a normal @Before or @BeforeClass method?
2011-03-11T08:49:36  <antlong> simonstewart, im guessing that setup_class is the equivalent of BeforeClass
2011-03-11T08:49:47  <bcave> i think im a bit uncertain about the test framework setup
2011-03-11T08:50:14  <antlong> simonstewart, we have setup_function, setup_method and setup_class specifically
2011-03-11T08:50:50  <antlong> bcave, theres isnt much setup you should have to do, other than importing the packages
2011-03-11T08:50:52  <simonstewart> antlong: Ahhh... okay. Mixed terminology. In JUnit, you'd use a method annotated with @BeforeClass for a one-time setup
2011-03-11T08:51:07  *** skiphuffman_ has joined #selenium
2011-03-11T08:52:13  <bcave> ok, i've always run tests within my build framework (e.g. ant / maven / gradle )
2011-03-11T08:52:38  <antlong> bcave, what version control software are you using for this project
2011-03-11T08:52:38  <jimevans> note to javascript devs: the ie9 javascript engine is slightly pickier than previous versions of IE.
2011-03-11T08:52:47  <bcave> and now what I want to do is deploy the web app, package a test suite and run it outside of the framework

2011-03-11T08:54:24  <antlong> bcave, do you know java well?
2011-03-11T08:54:27  <bcave> the thing is that all the examples are in main methods
2011-03-11T08:54:37  <jimevans> jarib: yep. the following construct used to work:
2011-03-11T08:54:41  <bcave> but i want to run it via a test framework
2011-03-11T08:54:42  <antlong> i think you would just call main()
2011-03-11T08:55:03  <bcave> yeah... compile it and invoke the class
2011-03-11T08:55:05  <jimevans> do { /*stuff here*/ } while (condition) return x;
2011-03-11T08:55:14  <antlong> bcave, the framework will tell you how to name your tests, in order for them to be picked up automatically
2011-03-11T08:55:23  <bcave> tested that - its working great inside main
2011-03-11T08:55:25  <ipmb> anybody seen webdriver hang on IE8? it loads the initial start page, but the client never returns
2011-03-11T08:55:33  <bcave> yeah... its more of a test framework question than selenium
2011-03-11T08:55:42  <jimevans> now you need the semi after the condition [eg, (condition); ]
2011-03-11T08:55:44  <antlong> normally you prefix your cases with test
2011-03-11T08:55:49  <bcave> yup...
2011-03-11T08:55:51  <antlong> test_foo, testFoo
2011-03-11T08:55:52  <bcave> i've got that...
2011-03-11T08:56:00  <jimevans> ipmb: what version of webdriver? 2.0b2?
2011-03-11T08:56:07  <simonstewart> antlong: with junit 4 you can just use the @Test annotation
2011-03-11T08:56:11  <jarib> jimevans: i see
2011-03-11T08:56:12  <ipmb> jimevans: yep
2011-03-11T08:56:19  <simonstewart> The naming convention was for Junit 3
2011-03-11T08:56:21  <bcave> iim using @Test, and using a test suite
2011-03-11T08:56:24  <bcave> all sorted...
2011-03-11T08:56:27  <jimevans> ipmb: Protected Mode settings for all zones?
2011-03-11T08:56:28  <simonstewart> Cool :)
2011-03-11T08:56:31  <antlong> simonstewart, noted :)
2011-03-11T08:56:39  <bcave> but during build time, the app isn't deployed, so I need to compile the test classes, and package them
2011-03-11T08:56:44  * ipmb checking
2011-03-11T08:56:53  <bcave> then once the app is finished packaging and deployed, THEN run the test suite
2011-03-11T08:56:53  <ipmb> I'm assuming that should be off?
2011-03-11T08:57:08  <simonstewart> bcave you're heading to a place where Ant would be useful
2011-03-11T08:57:12  <bcave> i.e. the test phase of the build framework is already complete...
2011-03-11T08:57:16  <bcave> simonstewart: gradle ;)
2011-03-11T08:57:28  <bcave> ill write the howto when i get this to work
2011-03-11T08:57:28  <simonstewart> As long as it's not maven ;P
2011-03-11T08:57:41  <bcave> haha. migrated away from it 2 weeks ago
2011-03-11T08:58:12  <jimevans> ipmb: doesn't matter what the setting is, as long as it's the same (on or off) for all zones.
2011-03-11T08:58:34  <bcave> loving it. groovy build definitions with ivy / ant build behind it
2011-03-11T08:58:39  <antlong> bcave, $ java -classpath .:junit.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestA TestB TestC...
2011-03-11T08:58:54  <bcave> awesome antlong. thats exactly what i was looking for
2011-03-11T08:58:55  <bcave> ty
2011-03-11T08:58:56  <RossPatterson> jimevans: jslint says "Syntax error: invalid return" for that code.
2011-03-11T08:58:57  <antlong> np
2011-03-11T09:00:01  <antlong> bcave, itll make your life easier to look @ svn hooks also

2011-03-11T09:01:41  <jimevans> RossPatterson: hey, man, not my code. :) maybe we should run jslint on the js-xpath code.
2011-03-11T09:01:58  <ipmb> hmm jimevans I don't have the "Enable Protected Mode" checkbox in my security settings
2011-03-11T09:02:07  <jimevans> you must be on XP then.
2011-03-11T09:02:10  <ipmb> jimevans: this is on 2k3 server
2011-03-11T09:02:19  <antlong> bcave, sounds like a solution only a non-programmer could come up with
2011-03-11T09:02:20  <jimevans> okay, same thing.
2011-03-11T09:02:25  <ipmb> I have the "enhanced security" disabled
2011-03-11T09:02:32  <RossPatterson> jimevans: Ah'm jus' sayin', iz all :-)  And yes, jslint rocks.
2011-03-11T09:02:46  <ipmb> jimevans: is there something else I can try?
2011-03-11T09:02:55  <bcave> <-- infrastructure >.<
2011-03-11T09:03:25  <antlong> bcave, you might benefit from selling hudson or jenkins to your team
2011-03-11T09:03:54  <jimevans> ipmb: you're successfully getting the startup page, so the port isn't blocked, but I'd double-check the firewall just the same.
2011-03-11T09:04:37  <antlong> does ie8 have any of those first run dialog boxes
2011-03-11T09:04:51  <ipmb> noting popped up

2011-03-11T09:06:04  <bcave> antlong: we are moving away from hudson
2011-03-11T09:06:14  <bcave> he has had a good 2 years with us, but its time to move on ;)

2011-03-11T09:07:22  <antlong> i use what does the job, in less time than i could build something in, 99% of the times it winds up being hudson
2011-03-11T09:07:48  <bcave> yeah, hudson worked really well
2011-03-11T09:08:02  <ipmb> bah, restarted Se2 server and now it works :/
2011-03-11T09:08:32  <antlong> ipmb, nice, wouldve been one hell of a debugging session otherwise
2011-03-11T09:08:54  *** dave_miles_cf has quit IRC
2011-03-11T09:09:03  <bcave> in terms of managing a CI system, its definitely better than what we have moved to, but both do the build, and the new system gives us some features we were specifically looking for in a CI system
2011-03-11T09:09:22  <simonstewart> I'm not convinced that selenium 1 has ever worked with IE 9
2011-03-11T09:09:38  <bcave> im not convinced IE9 has ever worked
2011-03-11T09:09:45  <atrenk> has it ever worked with any version of IE?
2011-03-11T09:10:00  <simonstewart> Heh. Sometimes
2011-03-11T09:10:01  <ipmb> do you guys do multiple IEs on one box or separate boxes/VM for each?
2011-03-11T09:10:08  <simonstewart> Separate machines
2011-03-11T09:10:13  <antlong> bcave, hudson does all of that. its a little more intensive though
2011-03-11T09:10:53  <bcave> antlong: environment management and build pipelines
2011-03-11T09:11:00  <ipmb> is it possible to downgrade IEs?
2011-03-11T09:11:00  <antlong> sure
2011-03-11T09:11:15  <ipmb> I'm running against EC2 and Win 2k3 has IE8 by default
2011-03-11T09:11:22  <antlong> its just a bit more of a read to get that working
2011-03-11T09:11:33  <antlong> ipmb, your bill is going to be nuts
2011-03-11T09:11:54  <ipmb> antlong: why?
2011-03-11T09:12:07  <antlong> ipmb, on ec2, they charge by the minute for a windows license
2011-03-11T09:12:10  <ipmb> I don't keep the instances running 24x7

2011-03-11T09:13:06  <bcave> but MS provides vm's of their OS's with different versions of ie for testing purposes
2011-03-11T09:14:25  <ipmb> not sure how that would work on EC2
2011-03-11T09:14:42  <ipmb> bcave: I'd be fine with just downgrading and having one running

2011-03-11T09:17:23  <antlong> ipmb, can you install each one, take a snapshot, then load the snapshot you need on demand
2011-03-11T09:17:32  <ipmb> yes
2011-03-11T09:17:53  <ipmb> my experience has been that those aren't perfect (standalone IEs)
2011-03-11T09:17:58  <antlong> no, they suck
2011-03-11T09:18:03  <antlong> but its convenient

2011-03-11T09:26:59  <simonstewart> I had a quick chat with Jason Huggins and he tells me that it works for him with 2.0b2

2011-03-11T09:27:10  <antlong> strange

2011-03-11T09:27:30  <antlong> win7 has some whacked default settings that you have to toggle
2011-03-11T09:29:21  <simonstewart> Ohhh... interesting.
2011-03-11T09:29:26  <simonstewart> Any idea what they are?

2011-03-11T11:37:13  <jimevans> regarding jason's patch, what are the implications, if any, on the compiled atom code? does the "optimization" mean we could be running different code in each browser? if so, how?
2011-03-11T11:37:34  * jimevans really should learn more about the compiling of javascript code.
2011-03-11T11:37:42  <simonstewart> Reading the change
2011-03-11T11:38:03  <simonstewart> It sets some variables when running the compiler
2011-03-11T11:38:10  <simonstewart> Which means more code can be removed
2011-03-11T11:38:19  *** antlong has joined #selenium
2011-03-11T11:38:25  <simonstewart> Which means smaller fragments
2011-03-11T11:38:55  <simonstewart> So if you compile a fragment with the ":ie" implicit target
2011-03-11T11:39:05  <antlong> just got beat at a local shop for $80 for a macbook pro charger
2011-03-11T11:39:12  <simonstewart> the compiler will assume that statements guarded with "userAgent.IE" are true
2011-03-11T11:39:21  <simonstewart> ouch
2011-03-11T11:40:04  <antlong> i think im going to try to expense it, heh.
2011-03-11T11:40:32  <jimevans> simonstewart: well, that's pretty clever. would be interesting to see if/how that would affect the ie atoms.
2011-03-11T11:41:00  <simonstewart> indeed
2011-03-11T11:41:03  <jimevans> i'm not sure why he decided to leave the ie atoms alone, unless we're just worried it might break something (which is a reasonable fear).
2011-03-11T11:41:29  <simonstewart> The checkin statement mentioned that they're in a generic location
2011-03-11T11:42:06  <simonstewart> jimevans: does the IE driver support keep alive now?
2011-03-11T11:42:17  <simonstewart> In the mongoose side of things
2011-03-11T11:42:44  <AutomatedTester> laters all
2011-03-11T11:42:45  <jimevans> should do. the place to look for sure is in webdriver.cpp where the mongoose server is started.

2011-03-11T11:45:23  <jimevans> that is cpp/build.desc

2011-03-11T11:47:53  <jleyba> Does visual studio support custom build steps?
2011-03-11T11:48:04  <jimevans> it *did* extend the build time quite a bit. :)
2011-03-11T11:48:07  <simonstewart> There was a step that was always being run which caused way too much to recompile
2011-03-11T11:48:12  <jleyba> For the iphone, we have a custom build step that regenerates atoms.h
2011-03-11T11:48:23  <jimevans> there's one for IE too.
2011-03-11T11:48:57  <jimevans> or rather there's a task for it.
2011-03-11T11:49:19  <jleyba> I meant to say XCode will invoke the rake task

2011-03-11T12:05:46  <simonstewart> Yeah. I've noticed that
2011-03-11T12:06:00  <jarib> so mongoose may not implement keep-alive properly
2011-03-11T12:06:19  <simonstewart> Putting in a hack so that if a bindexception is thrown we sleep and retry appears to solve the problem

2011-03-11T12:19:58  <jimevans> is it enough to say window.document.foo = null; ?
2011-03-11T12:20:40  <jarib> what sort of document change?
2011-03-11T12:21:07  <jimevans> say, a navigation to a new page, or setting the property to a different value.
2011-03-11T12:21:51  <jimevans> or am i just worrying about something i oughtn't?
2011-03-11T12:21:51  <jarib> if there are no references to the value, it will eventually be GCed
2011-03-11T12:22:09  <jarib> and i'm pretty sure the whole document is destroyed on navigation
2011-03-11T12:22:39  <jarib> at least it's not the author's responsibility after navigation.
2011-03-11T12:24:14  <jarib> "delete window.document.foo" works as well.
2011-03-11T12:27:28  <jimevans> I'm trying to apply a fix for ie9 support, but it's causing a crash in ie6. the fix involves creating a property on the document to which holds the anonymous function for executing js code.

2011-03-11T14:17:29  <simonstewart> Oh well. It's close to being right
2011-03-11T14:17:36  <simonstewart> And that is, actually, a genuine failure
2011-03-11T14:19:06  <jimevans> antlong: it's a crash in the IE driver.
2011-03-11T14:19:15  <jimevans> simonstewart: what's the failure?
2011-03-11T14:19:28  <simonstewart> It's a genuine failure by the look of it

2011-03-11T14:19:47  <jimevans> it's not in the hover() test is it?
2011-03-11T14:20:06  <simonstewart> yeah
2011-03-11T14:20:28  <jimevans> right. the moveto command is not implemented in the firefox extension.
2011-03-11T14:20:33  <jimevans> it's legit.

2011-03-11T14:23:31  <simonstewart> But I think that this is something else
2011-03-11T14:23:44  <jimevans> so how does ie get launched, in theory?
2011-03-11T14:23:58  <jimevans> createprocess? cocreateinstance?
2011-03-11T14:24:01  <simonstewart> A call to iexplore.exe
