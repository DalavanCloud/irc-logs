2011-06-19T07:31:56  <doc_tuna> have you installed all the java dependencies for selenium?
2011-06-19T07:32:06  <doc_tuna> and are you including the appropriate classes?

2011-06-19T07:41:49  <Mayank> Hi all I have this WebDriver wait code - http://pastebin.com/sw6SGpt1 , when the tests reaches to this function call, I get an error - exception in main, thread terminated, what am I missing?
2011-06-19T07:41:51  <Mayank> rpk: ^
2011-06-19T07:42:18  <Mayank> rpk: Goodmorning, <if it is morning at your place! :) >
2011-06-19T07:42:37  <rpk> Yep, almost afternoon :(
2011-06-19T07:43:01  <barancev> Mayank: morning! what exception?
2011-06-19T07:43:24  <rpk> yeah Mayank: the code looks ok
2011-06-19T07:43:40  <Mayank> heh! Good almost afternoon then ;)
2011-06-19T07:43:55  <Mayank> I am runnging the test again to paste the exception, give me a minute
2011-06-19T07:44:01  <Mayank> barancev: Good morning!
2011-06-19T07:44:22  <barancev> 7pm is here :)
2011-06-19T07:44:40  <rpk> shouldn't you be applying a timeout there as well?
2011-06-19T07:45:02  <rpk> wait.until(Condition, timeout);
2011-06-19T07:46:26  <Mayank> barancev: oh! Good evening! :)
2011-06-19T07:46:30  <Mayank> rpk, barancev: http://pastebin.com/DQyUMDBG
2011-06-19T07:46:39  <Mayank> Here is the exception.
2011-06-19T07:47:02  <rpk> thats the entire stack trace?
2011-06-19T07:47:18  <rpk> and what line is 165 in your test?
2011-06-19T07:47:21  <barancev> and what is in scorm_test.java:165?
2011-06-19T07:47:30  <rpk> barancev: lol
2011-06-19T07:47:38  <barancev> yea :)
2011-06-19T07:48:23  <Mayank> it is this - wait.until(new ExpectedCondition<Boolean>() {
2011-06-19T07:48:42  <Mayank> i need to add timeout as well
2011-06-19T07:49:06  <barancev> then, wait is probably equal to null
2011-06-19T07:53:15  <Mayank> should it be like this - http://pastebin.com/dai1YYtp, *i am not sure*
2011-06-19T07:54:04  <barancev> check 'wait' variable. is it initialized?
2011-06-19T07:55:33  <Mayank> barancev: No, :/ I have just declared it as -> static Wait<WebDriver> wait;
2011-06-19T07:56:18  <barancev> that's why you've got NPE :)
2011-06-19T07:56:49  <Mayank> NPE?
2011-06-19T07:56:58  <Mayank> rpk, barancev: thanks! :)
2011-06-19T07:57:07  <barancev> NullPointerException
2011-06-19T07:57:11  <Mayank> Oh!
2011-06-19T07:57:32  <rpk> you never uh, initialized your wait :P
2011-06-19T07:57:44  <Mayank> rpk: yeah! :/
2011-06-19T07:58:27  <barancev> you'd better use WebDriver wait class: new WebDriverWait(driver, timeout).until(yuorContitionHere);
2011-06-19T07:59:03  <barancev> Wait<WebDriver> is an interface, but you don't need to implement it yourself
2011-06-19T08:00:30  <Mayank> Ok, Ill use it instead.
2011-06-19T08:00:43  <barancev> or.... ta-da! use implicit waits!
2011-06-19T08:01:07  <rpk> bad practice :P
2011-06-19T08:01:26  <rpk> unless you're using crap like gwt, then they're practically required
2011-06-19T08:01:30  <rpk> :/
2011-06-19T08:02:03  <Mayank> heh! Ok, didn know that!
2011-06-19T08:02:13  <barancev> not so bad, as se2.0 is officially async
2011-06-19T08:02:57  <barancev> you never know for sure what's faster - selenium or the browser
2011-06-19T08:03:11  <rpk> usually selenium
2011-06-19T08:03:28  <Mayank> just asking - if you have any idea to get over with onLoad alert / confirmation events? I am depending on using Selenium + AutoIt for it, or else I will have to switch to C# :/
2011-06-19T08:03:55  <barancev> if your findElement starts to run BEFORE browser started to change DOM -- findElement is not blocking, it just says no such element
2011-06-19T08:04:05  <rpk> you mean like dialogues?
2011-06-19T08:04:14  <barancev> I mean ANY element
2011-06-19T08:04:19  <rpk> and just use an implicit wait, it'll keep trying until the element exists
2011-06-19T08:04:29  <rpk> (or you timeout)
2011-06-19T08:04:50  <Mayank> So I neednt' change?
2011-06-19T08:04:50  <barancev> yes, it was my advice - to use implicit waits :)
2011-06-19T08:05:07  <rpk> barancev: it was my advice yesterday too :P
2011-06-19T08:05:10  <Mayank> Oh! I took it the other way! sorry.
2011-06-19T08:05:13  <Mayank> rpk: yes!
2011-06-19T08:05:14  <Mayank> ;)
2011-06-19T08:05:47  <Mayank> any idea for handling onLoad alerts?
2011-06-19T08:05:58  <barancev> rpk: so why you told it is a bad practice?
2011-06-19T08:06:16  <rpk> Se devs said that
2011-06-19T08:06:38  <rpk> I kind of agree, its more ideal if you can run the test and only wait when you have to
2011-06-19T08:06:54  <rpk> rather than having a giant catch all wait
2011-06-19T08:07:11  <rpk> it could potentially hide weird problems in your pages as well
2011-06-19T08:07:20  <Mayank> rpk: like?
2011-06-19T08:07:33  <rpk> Say you have javascript building dom elements, or eventing setup
2011-06-19T08:07:45  <barancev> if your elements are just-in-time it their places, implicit waits will never used
2011-06-19T08:07:51  <rpk> and the order of the events indicates that certain elements should be available before others
2011-06-19T08:08:10  <rpk> having an implicit wait would cover over a problem in your synchronous eventing order
2011-06-19T08:08:10  <Mayank> Hmm, yeap.
2011-06-19T08:08:11  <barancev> they started to wait only if an element is not found in the first attempt
2011-06-19T08:08:41  <rpk> barancev: yeah, but you won't know that it couldn't find it and then waited, and then later found it
2011-06-19T08:10:13  <barancev> if your expect sometime to NOT find an element - yes, implicit waits should be off, but if you wait to click - they do it for you, and they faster because they are on browser side
2011-06-19T08:47:43  <Mayank> rpk, barancev: I am unable to make selenium find the div with id - "teststatus" on line no - 220, of this - http://pastebin.com/Pr6cK9TX. The page has an html object tag, I am using this code - http://pastebin.com/V2a3gWYR. It timesout after 30 seconds, though the element I am seraching for is visible on the page much before.
2011-06-19T08:49:49  <rpk> is the div in a different frame?
2011-06-19T08:49:56  <barancev> Mayank: (while I'm looking at the code) are you testing moodle for your own installation or for the project benefits?
2011-06-19T08:50:36  <barancev> Mayank: I mean Moodle project
2011-06-19T08:51:08  <Mayank> barancev:Moodle Project,  I am Google summer of Code student and I am setting up a test harness for SCORM.
2011-06-19T08:51:15  <Mayank> I am a *
2011-06-19T08:51:52  <barancev> excellent! :) I use Moodle for my online trainings, ant it is nice to see it is tested with Selenium
2011-06-19T08:52:21  <Mayank> :)
2011-06-19T08:53:27  <Mayank> Will have to look for alternatives, if AutoIt does not work for supressing onLoad alerts. which is very unlikely!
2011-06-19T09:00:56  <barancev> works for me without waits
2011-06-19T09:01:05  <barancev> lemme check with wait
2011-06-19T09:02:32  <Mayank> without wait?
2011-06-19T09:02:56  <Mayank> but that object tag loads after words the page loads
2011-06-19T09:02:57  <barancev> yes. with wait it works as well
2011-06-19T09:03:12  <Mayank> could you paste your code?
2011-06-19T09:03:29  <Mayank> after the page loads*
2011-06-19T09:04:05  <barancev> System.out.println(browser.findElement(By.id("teststatus")));
2011-06-19T09:04:35  <Mayank> and with waits?
2011-06-19T09:05:02  <Mayank> when I try and do it - it says - the element could not be found.
2011-06-19T09:05:17  <barancev> I've just added your waiting condition
2011-06-19T09:05:27  <Mayank> Um Um!
2011-06-19T09:05:32  <barancev> lemme check with the browsers other that chrome
2011-06-19T09:05:38  <Mayank> IE
2011-06-19T09:05:40  <Mayank> could you please?
2011-06-19T09:07:28  <barancev> works with IE
2011-06-19T09:07:52  <barancev> IE9, Win7 x64, selenium built from trunk
2011-06-19T09:09:32  <Mayank> I am on IE 8, Ill check with IE9, and I am usign the standalone jar package - 2.0rc2 *works better release*. Can you still paste your full code? I might be missing something somehwere?

2011-06-19T09:11:09  <barancev> no, nothing interesting:
2011-06-19T09:11:25  <barancev> browser.get("http://localhost/scorm.html");
2011-06-19T09:11:25  <barancev>         System.out.println(browser.findElement(By.id("teststatus")));
2011-06-19T09:12:06  <barancev> scorm.html contains the code from your pastebin
2011-06-19T09:13:33  <Mayank> Ah, thats what! in Moodle this code loads inside the object tag. When I inspect element object tag, it shows nothing inside the object tag. that's not a problem as rpk said.  I should still be able to find this element (inside Moodle)?
2011-06-19T09:13:57  <Mayank> I copied this code from opening the frame in a new tab.
2011-06-19T09:14:41  <barancev> if it is in a frame, you have to switch to this trame first
2011-06-19T09:15:04  <barancev> other that that - it should work identically
2011-06-19T09:16:18  <Mayank> tried it, no sucess. It is actually inside an html object tag. http://pastebin.com/Pr6cK9TX
2011-06-19T09:17:16  <barancev> is there a public page? or do you have a sample scorm file? I'll try to load it into my Moodle
2011-06-19T09:17:56  <barancev> inside an object... it's interesting to look at DOM
2011-06-19T09:18:24  <Mayank> Ill upload the SCORM file, I do not have have a public install right now.
2011-06-19T09:21:31  <Mayank> barancev: https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B2NfqQC7XKbtMGQxNDVjYTMtNzY1ZS00MTA3LThiNTktMTE1N2U0MjU3NTI0&hl=en_US&authkey=CPns8_gI
2011-06-19T09:22:56  <barancev> it is an exported course, right?
2011-06-19T09:23:54  <Mayank> You will have to add the scorm package as an activity in one of your courses.
2011-06-19T09:24:00  <Mayank> Should I export the course?
2011-06-19T09:24:49  <barancev> what to do wuth this zip file? I can add a SCORM activity, but it requires SCROM file
2011-06-19T09:25:32  <barancev> shold I add the whole zip archive or a file extracted from it?
2011-06-19T09:25:37  <Mayank> Add the zip file itself.
2011-06-19T09:25:53  <Mayank> You have to add the archive itself, there is no need to unzip!
