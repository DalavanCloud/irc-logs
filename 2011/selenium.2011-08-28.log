2011-08-28T10:21:38  <andref> hi
2011-08-28T10:22:18  <andref> a small question - is it possible to specyfi selenium, so it would try every browser?
2011-08-28T10:25:09  <andref> i.e. you have a test case and you wish to run it on both on Chrome and on IE browser, and you wish to try it on Linux and Windows?
2011-08-28T10:25:42  <andref> is there a trick that would do that?
2011-08-28T10:26:53  <andref> (I'm intrested in Selenium 1 and Selenium2 solutions if they exist)

2011-08-28T12:29:42  <cgoldberg> andref, so use a framework.. or a service like sauce labs
2011-08-28T12:30:42  <andref> so I have to make different br1=wd.Remote(..."firefox"...) br2=wd.Remote(..."chrome"...) ....
2011-08-28T12:31:14  <andref> and execute the same methods for them...
2011-08-28T12:31:17  <andref> ?

2011-08-28T12:34:05  <cgoldberg> andref.. do you use a framework of sorts?  how do you run your code?
2011-08-28T12:34:10  * andref dos know how to solve it if there is no such an opit howeather multibrowser execution is very desired
2011-08-28T12:35:22  <cgoldberg> andref, my framework has a command line option you pass in.. to tell it which browser to run the suite on
2011-08-28T12:35:33  <cgoldberg> and can also kick of tests remotely on anyh platform/browser
2011-08-28T12:36:02  <cgoldberg> andref, suace is a service you can run your tests on.. they provide various os/browser options.. check em out
2011-08-28T12:36:06  <andref> cgoldberg: so I have to add such a functionality my own?
2011-08-28T12:36:22  <andref> oh
2011-08-28T12:36:36  <cgoldberg> andref, add it to your own framework.. or adopt a framework that supports it
2011-08-28T12:37:21  *** DustinFay has quit IRC
2011-08-28T12:38:09  <andref> cgoldberg: suace? Is it dedicated for selenium?
2011-08-28T12:38:21  <andref> *sauce
2011-08-28T12:38:31  <AutomatedTester> andref: at Mozilla we use Py.test for running our python tests
2011-08-28T12:38:48  <cgoldberg> andref, believe so.  check them out.. i can't give it a proper pitch
2011-08-28T12:38:50  <AutomatedTester> and we have a plugin for pytest that allows you to just pass in the browser you want
2011-08-28T12:39:14  *** Siph0n has joined #selenium
2011-08-28T12:40:54  <andref> I see... I'll check sauce and if it won't handle as I want to than I'll see Py.test

2011-08-28T12:41:30  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, sup dude... hey.. question.. has anyone done a code_warm video of selenium code base?   ..... I was up all night getting code_swarm to run on Ubuntu.. finally got it running and am cranking out videos :)
2011-08-28T12:41:38  * andref just learned a little bit about unittest
2011-08-28T12:42:04  <AutomatedTester> code_swarm?
2011-08-28T12:42:11  <cgoldberg> andref, my framework is built on top of unittest.. unittest is a good starting point for python
2011-08-28T12:43:04  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester,  https://plus.google.com/114546378907380458640/posts/VirNQ2iwDbm
2011-08-28T12:43:24  <AutomatedTester> andref: that plugin also supports using SauceLabs
2011-08-28T12:43:40  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, or better yet:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VAOA3PB4mM
2011-08-28T12:44:04  <cgoldberg> i made that video last night... I'm doing some today for Ubuntu related projects
2011-08-28T12:44:15  <andref> cgoldberg: is sauce properytary? so it cannot be used by a company?
2011-08-28T12:44:25  <cgoldberg> andref, it's a service
2011-08-28T12:44:33  <cgoldberg> andref, have you looked at grid?
2011-08-28T12:44:41  <andref> yes
2011-08-28T12:44:47  <cgoldberg> andref, that's how you can build your own
2011-08-28T12:45:16  <AutomatedTester> cgoldberg: looks good, since I havent heard about it I dont think anyone has done that
2011-08-28T12:45:45  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, what kinda repo is selenium in.. svn? git?
2011-08-28T12:45:52  <AutomatedTester> svn
2011-08-28T12:45:55  * cgoldberg should know this
2011-08-28T12:46:14  <cgoldberg> AutomatedTester, does the commit history go all the back?
2011-08-28T12:46:22  <AutomatedTester> should do
