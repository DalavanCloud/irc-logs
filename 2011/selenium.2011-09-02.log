2011-09-02T01:29:42  <ato> AutomatedTester: We'll likely get v0.7 released today of OperaDriver, so that will go in 2.6. (-:
2011-09-02T01:29:43  <Ajay> AutomatedTester: Versions were bumped yesterday
2011-09-02T01:29:50  <ato> darn.

2011-09-02T01:29:55  <ato> Okay, next version then.

2011-09-02T01:30:28  <Ajay> AutomatedTester: there were some test failures
2011-09-02T01:30:35  <Ajay> so release is still due

2011-09-02T01:34:03  <krosenvold_> The atom tests were failing on ff3
2011-09-02T01:34:17  <krosenvold_> I dunno about the others

2011-09-02T01:52:26  <Ajay> yes
2011-09-02T01:52:38  <Ajay> why is the !!select instead of select
2011-09-02T01:53:00  <Stuk> Ajay: it turns something like "true" into true
2011-09-02T01:53:10  <Stuk> basically not-ing it twice
2011-09-02T01:53:29  <Ajay> whats the use of it ? the state remains the same right ?
2011-09-02T01:53:58  <Stuk> yep, the state stays the same
2011-09-02T01:54:09  *** freynaud has joined #selenium
2011-09-02T01:54:15  <Stuk> in this case it's possibly not necessary as we're &&ing it with something else
2011-09-02T01:54:31  <Ajay> yeah
2011-09-02T01:54:43  <Stuk> but if we wanted to return a boolean from the function, and select might be a string, this technique makes sure that it is a boolean
2011-09-02T01:54:52  <freynaud> Good morning
2011-09-02T01:55:01  <Stuk> mornin'
2011-09-02T01:55:51  <Ajay> Hmm... Thanks thats the answer i was looking for :)
2011-09-02T01:56:04  <AutomatedTester> Ajay: it does type inference on it
2011-09-02T01:56:32  <AutomatedTester> so if select is a string that contains true it forces it to a boolean
2011-09-02T01:56:52  <AutomatedTester> oh missed Stuks answer
2011-09-02T01:57:38  <AutomatedTester> Ajay: another bit of javascript syntactic sugar is to add a + in front of a variable to make it an int
2011-09-02T01:57:49  <AutomatedTester> e.g. +"1" === 1
2011-09-02T01:58:27  <AutomatedTester> Ajay: if you want a good book for JavaScript I recommend JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford

2011-09-02T02:18:37  <simonstewart> I have no idea.
2011-09-02T02:18:47  <simonstewart> I suspect it's a race with inner and outer windows
2011-09-02T02:18:48  <stephend> is it some security thing?  is there an exception thrown?
2011-09-02T02:18:55  <stephend> I can follow up with some folks @ mozilla
2011-09-02T02:18:58  <simonstewart> We're just very fast
2011-09-02T02:19:22  <simonstewart> So the outer window doesn't match the inner window
2011-09-02T02:19:30  <simonstewart> (actually the other way round, but you get the idea)
2011-09-02T02:19:43  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: you suspicion is correct
2011-09-02T02:19:45  <stephend> ah
2011-09-02T02:20:04  <AutomatedTester> and its a "feature" until I can prove otherwise
2011-09-02T02:20:16  <freynaud> great :p
2011-09-02T02:20:52  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart and I discussed it with some platform people and they said "you need to handle that"
2011-09-02T02:21:02  <stephend> is there better logging in 2.6.0 wrt threads?
2011-09-02T02:21:29  <stephend> nice that simonstewart at least added the session ID to the exception before the rewrite -- hope that made it in the new architecture :-)
2011-09-02T02:22:48  <davehunt> stephend: that will be in 2.6, yes
2011-09-02T02:22:56  <stephend> great
2011-09-02T02:23:05  <stephend> might it be worth running, just to get logs again?
2011-09-02T02:23:21  <stephend> I'm willing to take a partial hit to our CI on a friday
2011-09-02T02:23:35  <davehunt> I don't think 2.6 is out yet tho
2011-09-02T02:23:45  <davehunt> So it's dependant on that atm

2011-09-02T02:24:21  <stephend> like 1.0.8 :-)

2011-09-02T02:24:33  <stephend> (which ended up being final anyhow -- we checked the timestamp)
2011-09-02T02:24:41  <stephend> sounds good to me

2011-09-02T03:30:08  <simonstewart> When I get a chance to stop fighting fires here, it'll be fun to set up a sample page (quirks mode and standards mode) that allows us to not run into these issues
2011-09-02T03:30:19  <simonstewart> Or, if everyone used google closure, that'd help
2011-09-02T03:30:27  <jarib> hehe
2011-09-02T03:31:00  <jarib> you could easily write code with closure that would expose this same issue
2011-09-02T03:31:07  <jarib> jquery is just popular.
2011-09-02T03:31:32  <jarib> it appears that firefox will place the cursor at the position you click it (when testing manually)
2011-09-02T03:31:37  <simonstewart> Not so sure. We run an awful lot of tests against closure apps using the atoms here and we don't bump into this
2011-09-02T03:32:11  <jarib> while element.focus() will place it at the beginning (at least in FF6)
2011-09-02T03:32:28  <simonstewart> hohoho
2011-09-02T03:32:45  <simonstewart> sounds like we should click and then move the cursor to the end of the line
2011-09-02T03:32:59  <simonstewart> Of course, we should do the moving after a setTimeout so that the damn browser can process everything
2011-09-02T03:35:00  <jarib> if we do that, the masked input thing would still fail
2011-09-02T03:35:17  <simonstewart> What exactly is a masked input?
2011-09-02T03:35:20  <jarib> the correct thing to do would be to click the element far right
2011-09-02T03:35:25  <jarib> it's stupid
2011-09-02T03:35:26  <jarib> http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
2011-09-02T03:35:27  <simonstewart> Really?
2011-09-02T03:35:30  <jarib> click the demo tab
2011-09-02T03:35:54  <jarib> it moves the cursor on focus
2011-09-02T03:36:14  <jarib> so if we move the cursor after focusing, it'll fail
2011-09-02T03:36:15  <simonstewart> So how come letting the browser process the command and then moving the cursor won't work?
2011-09-02T03:36:17  <jarib> ditto if a user does that
2011-09-02T03:36:39  <simonstewart> That component is crapping out on chrome
2011-09-02T03:37:10  <jarib> it's working in chrome for me
2011-09-02T03:37:16  <jarib> for some definition of "working"
2011-09-02T03:37:19  <simonstewart> Moving the cursor after focusing seems to be working for me
2011-09-02T03:37:23  <simonstewart> I reloaded the page
2011-09-02T03:37:27  <simonstewart> It stopped freaking out
2011-09-02T03:37:49  <jarib> yes, you can move the cursor, but then you can't type
2011-09-02T03:38:08  <simonstewart> hahahaha
2011-09-02T03:38:13  <simonstewart> I could weep
2011-09-02T03:39:12  <jarib> let me see if i can come up with a click solution without everything falling over

2011-09-02T05:23:53  <barancev|2> I've added a comment
2011-09-02T05:23:58  <RossPatterson> Comment 1 by barancev, Today (20 minutes ago)
2011-09-02T05:23:58  <RossPatterson> It is a Java issue, not the Selenium one.
2011-09-02T05:23:59  <RossPatterson> Try this:
2011-09-02T05:23:59  <RossPatterson> System.out.println(System.getProperty("os.arch"));
2011-09-02T05:23:59  <RossPatterson> and see what Java thinks about your operating system.
2011-09-02T05:24:12  <barancev|2> can you put the issue in needclarification at least?

2011-09-02T06:50:53  <Parabola> writing my own testing framework was much easier than trying to make testNG work
2011-09-02T06:53:22  <simonstewart> Heaven's. Don't use TestNG. Use JUnit
2011-09-02T06:53:28  <Parabola> ffs

2011-09-02T06:54:47  <simonstewart> Both TestNG and JUnit have a "@Test" annotation
2011-09-02T06:55:00  <Parabola> but i'm finding it fking frustrating as all the documentation assumes previous knoweldge

2011-09-02T06:57:19  <barancev|2> TestNG deals better with @Before and @After -- you can define them in a base class, no need to include them in every test class

2011-09-02T06:58:56  <Ajay> which is not in junit
2011-09-02T06:58:57  <barancev|2> it seems to ignore my @Before annotations in the base class
2011-09-02T06:59:08  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: does your company hate its developers/testers?
2011-09-02T06:59:14  <simonstewart> True. But then I tend to think that if you get yourself into a spot where you need them somethign else is broken
2011-09-02T06:59:20  <barancev|2> JHUnit has Categories

2011-09-02T07:44:20  <webben> i'm running a JUnit test via ant.
2011-09-02T07:44:33  <webben> the JUnit fires up a local selenium server
2011-09-02T07:44:47  <webben> i'm getting the junit task to log stdout output
2011-09-02T07:44:58  <XRayCulver> you can use -role webdriver or -role wd?
2011-09-02T07:45:09  <webben> is there some way I can suppress (or at least dial back) selenium logging in that output?
2011-09-02T07:45:26  <webben> e.g. by setting some system property on the ant command line
2011-09-02T07:45:46  <webben> I'm struggling to see the wood of my failing tests through the wood of selenium loggery

2011-09-02T07:47:49  <lukeis> wd == webdriver
2011-09-02T07:47:50  <adamgoucher> so, from a client: We have an application that takes webkit and embeds our <app> functionality into the browser so that whenever you find media, we can <do app stuff>. Do you think this might be a good candidate for some WebDriver checks? -- do they want webkidriver or the ios/android versions?

2011-09-02T07:52:59  <freynaud> XRayCulver: as I said, using a json file to specify the capabilities of the client is less messy

2011-09-02T07:57:27  <lukeis> iOS isn't being released since you need to have a iOS developers license to build for real devices (and the easiest way to get it in the emulator is building yourself anyways)... dounia seems to be handling the android one... but they should follow the major releases since they both depend on the atoms

2011-09-02T12:42:29  <AutomatedTester> feels like its a "not our issue"
2011-09-02T12:43:26  <Ajay> AutomatedTester: sure not our issue
2011-09-02T12:44:03  <Ajay> lukeis:  #2391 patch attached
2011-09-02T12:44:04  <selbot2> luke.sem...@gmail.com open/accepted WebElement setSelected() and getValue() and toggle() method were deprecated and removed, update SeHQ docs to reflect the current state of the API - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2391 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Component-Docs]
2011-09-02T12:44:39  <RossPatterson> Dunno about that.  That's a REALLY simple test case.  Either there was almost no heap available to start with, or BeanToJsonConverter ate it all.
2011-09-02T12:44:50  *** jibay has quit IRC
2011-09-02T12:45:52  <RossPatterson> OTOH, it's 2.2.0, and was opened today.  Weren't there some OOM bugs in the early 2.x releases?
2011-09-02T12:46:09  <AutomatedTester> RossPatterson: yea but not in that area
2011-09-02T12:46:42  <lukeis>  there could be something there if the FirefoxProfile is massive... guess ask if they can increase their jvm and provide a copy of the profile they are using?
2011-09-02T12:47:41  <AutomatedTester> lukeis: was already asking that
2011-09-02T12:47:49  <AutomatedTester> I like your thinking
2011-09-02T12:49:08  <Ajay> ask for heap dump :)

2011-09-02T12:50:24  *** berrada has joined #selenium
2011-09-02T12:51:30  <lukeis> AutomatedTester: good job? :)  ... and I just looked at the line of source for that version for that bug... it's when it's preparing the json request TO the remote server... so probably the profile is massive
2011-09-02T12:51:44  <lukeis> good job! (not ?)
2011-09-02T12:51:44  *** Binken_ has quit IRC
2011-09-02T12:52:18  <AutomatedTester> lukeis: yea, after looking at it again I saw the same thing
2011-09-02T12:52:35  <Ajay> berrada: added the  patch again let me know  if u r able to apply it or not
2011-09-02T12:54:31  <berrada> if still fails, but I can do the merge later

2011-09-02T12:54:51  <berrada> Ajay the repackaged jetty jar broke android
2011-09-02T12:55:23  <Ajay> Oh
2011-09-02T12:55:48  <berrada> did you run the android tests?
2011-09-02T12:55:54  <berrada> I assumed you did so I did not
2011-09-02T12:56:30  <Ajay> i was unable to setup the environment on windows
2011-09-02T12:57:04  <berrada> oh ok
2011-09-02T12:58:23  <berrada> :q!
2011-09-02T12:58:30  <berrada> oups wrong window
2011-09-02T12:58:40  <Ajay> * feeling guilty
2011-09-02T12:58:56  <berrada> No worries, I'm looking at it
2011-09-02T12:59:17  <AutomatedTester> is htmlunitdriver close() call supposed to be the same as quit()?
2011-09-02T12:59:20  <berrada> It's probably something small that Android's complaining about
2011-09-02T12:59:29  <Ajay> Thanks , i will be sticking around here till it gets fixed
2011-09-02T13:00:28  <berrada> What did you remove from the original jar?
2011-09-02T13:02:03  <lukeis> AutomatedTester: i don't think so... you can still have multiple "windows" open i think
2011-09-02T13:02:28  * AutomatedTester needs to start using htmlunit
2011-09-02T13:02:52  <lukeis> it's not all that nice on pages with js
2011-09-02T13:03:26  * AutomatedTester likes using a real browser for some stupid reason
2011-09-02T13:05:33  <Ajay> berrada: nothing is removed from the jars
2011-09-02T13:06:07  <berrada> so what went into the repackaging?
2011-09-02T13:08:46  *** Fyrespray has joined #selenium

2011-09-02T13:11:21  <berrada> Ajay: I'm going to to revert for now

2011-09-02T13:12:36  <AutomatedTester> berrada: is #855 supposed to be open?

2011-09-02T13:15:24  <berrada> AutomatedTester: yes it's still open and needs to be verified on all drivers
2011-09-02T13:15:28  <berrada> ok
2011-09-02T13:15:55  <AutomatedTester> berrada: mind verifying on the iphone driver, if you have time today?
2011-09-02T13:17:46  <AutomatedTester> or any other west coaster in here
2011-09-02T13:18:00  <AutomatedTester> and with that I am off!

2011-09-02T14:31:16  <lukeis> yeah... most likely however they setup the webserver for sehq it is actually a virtual machine (at least in my experience that's why this happens)
