2011-05-02T02:15:41  <AutomatedTester> hey, anything interesting happened in the last 2 weeks?
2011-05-02T02:16:00  <jarib> nope
2011-05-02T02:16:03  <jarib> heh
2011-05-02T02:16:08  <AutomatedTester> fair enough
2011-05-02T02:16:18  <AutomatedTester> do you know if Chrome supports screenshots?
2011-05-02T02:16:55  <jarib> i think it does but it's not exposed yet
2011-05-02T02:17:06  <jarib> there's mention of screenshots in the C++ code, but the REST endpoints don't work

2011-05-02T02:45:24  <vmassol> hi guys. Got a problem upgrading to se 2.0 beta3. Some test that was working before and failing now.
2011-05-02T02:46:15  <vmassol> Basically I now get a StaleElementReferenceException on getText() in this snippet: http://pastebin.com/unSEdznT
2011-05-02T02:46:34  <vmassol> I'm a bit at a lack to understand how that could be....
2011-05-02T02:48:08  <jarib> that's weird. can we see the stacktrace? what version did you upgrade from?
2011-05-02T02:48:29  <vmassol> jarib: we had 2.0b1 before
2011-05-02T02:48:32  <vmassol> let me paste the stack

2011-05-02T02:50:42  <vmassol> org.xwiki.test.ui.framework.elements.editor.wysiwyg.RichTextAreaElement.getContent(RichTextAreaElement.java:57) corresponds to the first snippet I pasted
2011-05-02T02:50:49  <jarib> vmassol: does it fail consistently?
2011-05-02T02:50:52  <vmassol> yes
2011-05-02T02:50:58  <jarib> hm
2011-05-02T02:54:29  <vmassol> jarib: if I do         System.out.println(getDriver().getPageSource()); just before the getText() I can see the correct content

2011-05-02T03:41:58  <jarib> vmassol: not really. if it's consistent, probably not a timing issue, but you could try adding a Thread.sleep before the getText() call to see if that changes anything
2011-05-02T03:42:06  <jarib> (as a debugging aid, not as a real solution)
2011-05-02T03:42:22  <vmassol> jarib: ok testing now

2011-05-02T03:50:26  <vmassol> (FirefoxDriver())
2011-05-02T04:04:07  <vmassol> jarib: basically if I put a breakpoint in the code just before the findElement (or if I use a sleep with a large enough value) I get: org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: this.getWindow() is null
2011-05-02T04:04:21  <vmassol> trying to trace it in the selenium code but the codebase is new to me
2011-05-02T04:06:19  <vmassol> I traced it till HttpCommandExecutor when it calls: fallbackExecute
2011-05-02T04:06:30  <vmassol> and the Http Response returned has a status line of "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error"

2011-05-02T05:53:38  <DarkRift> is it possible with a command from the selenium grid to execute an external command instead of an in browser command ?
2011-05-02T05:53:49  <DarkRift> on the slaves
2011-05-02T05:54:14  <AutomatedTester> control something other than a browser?
2011-05-02T05:54:54  <DarkRift> well just be able to execute another executable
2011-05-02T05:54:58  <DarkRift> welll what I'm trying to do is
2011-05-02T05:55:37  <AutomatedTester> freynaud: will be the best person to answer but I think in theory you can with Grid2
2011-05-02T05:55:59  <DarkRift> since the screenshot capture is not functionnal for iexplorer HTA, it could probably be done through the call of the Robot java class
2011-05-02T05:56:08  <DarkRift> so I wondered if that could be done
2011-05-02T05:56:22  <DarkRift> but since the grid only sends the "selenium commands" to the slaves ...
2011-05-02T05:57:37  <DarkRift> hummm 2 second I might have found a way

2011-05-02T06:00:15  <AutomatedTester> since grid is just a multiplexer for rest commands

2011-05-02T06:38:16  <DarkRift> well almost
2011-05-02T06:39:00  <DarkRift> I'm trying to capture the screenshot of the whole browser with captureEntirePageScreenshotToString
2011-05-02T06:39:25  <DarkRift> but the company I'm working for will need to have the screenshot of IE6 to IE8
2011-05-02T06:39:41  <DarkRift> it works damn fine for firefox, but I can't seem to make it works with the IEs
2011-05-02T06:39:52  <DarkRift> I'm getting

2011-05-02T06:44:28  <DarkRift> freynaud ?
2011-05-02T06:45:34  <freynaud> the best would be to use selenium2, IE screenshot are working there now I beieve
2011-05-02T06:46:09  <freynaud> otherwise, you can use snapsie. It requires some steps to setup but it works ok
2011-05-02T06:46:41  <DarkRift> I'm using selenium-grid 1.0.8
2011-05-02T06:47:28  <DarkRift> with childs being run from selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3
2011-05-02T06:47:33  <freynaud> the screenshot thing isn't in grid, it's in the remote control server. That's where you need to do the setup
2011-05-02T06:48:16  <DarkRift> shouldn't selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3 able to take those screenshots ?
2011-05-02T06:48:22  <DarkRift> be *
2011-05-02T06:48:43  <freynaud> if you use web driver api, it should I think
2011-05-02T06:48:55  <freynaud> with legacy selenium, I don't think it will work
2011-05-02T06:49:05  <DarkRift> I'm pretty new to this stuff, started reading about it last week
2011-05-02T06:49:42  <DarkRift> I started from the WebTestInvolvingMultiEnvironments demo
2011-05-02T06:50:03  <DarkRift> copied the target and just changed my class, did no change in the slaves, do I need to ?
2011-05-02T06:50:50  <freynaud> WebTestInvolvingMultiEnvironments
2011-05-02T06:50:55  <freynaud> what is that ?
2011-05-02T06:51:12  <DarkRift> it's a demo class coming with selenium grid
2011-05-02T06:51:12  <DarkRift> https://github.com/ph7/selenium-grid/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/grid/demo/WebTestInvolvingMultiEnvironments.java
2011-05-02T06:51:47  <freynaud> you're starting selenium from scratch ?
2011-05-02T06:51:52  <DarkRift> yes
2011-05-02T06:52:04  <DarkRift> is it possible to make a distributed environment without selenium grid ? I mean, having multiple VMs for the different OS/browsers version
2011-05-02T06:52:27  <DarkRift> I'm totally new to selenium
2011-05-02T06:53:27  <DarkRift> I wanted to give the company I'm working for a new testing tool to ease the web testing ... but if I can't make screenshots, that's pretty bad actually because we can't rely on the only hope the assertions are good as we want to see the design as well
2011-05-02T06:53:45  <DarkRift> hence a manual is still needed but the execution will be autoamted
2011-05-02T06:53:50  <DarkRift> manual validation *
2011-05-02T06:55:44  <DarkRift> so I thought using grid would ease the configuration as you only need to add a new slave to be able to test a new browser configuration
2011-05-02T06:56:07  <freynaud> this channel is not the best place for beginner questions btw
2011-05-02T06:56:15  <DarkRift> hummm
2011-05-02T07:00:25  <AutomatedTester> freynaud: why isnt this a good place for beginner questions?

2011-05-02T07:08:36  <RossPatterson> DarkRift: Selenium 1.0 can't take IE snapshots on its own.  There's a helper you need to install, called "SnapsIE" (https://github.com/nirvdrum/SnapsIE).  Once you install it on the machine where the browser will run, the existing capture*ScreenShot* functions should work.

2011-05-02T07:21:10  <dwight> ok, i have created some test cases using the selenium ide tool and exporeted these test cases in to selenium rc in java junit, i have setup everything correctly and started the selenium proxy server, problem is when i run my text it only lasts for about 5 secs when i excute it from selenium rc it should be much longer, any ideas how i can get the whole test case to play? any help would be helpful
2011-05-02T07:21:28  *** rbalent has joined #selenium
2011-05-02T07:21:48  <AutomatedTester> dwight: do you get a stacktrace
2011-05-02T07:22:05  <dwight> not sure what that is where do i locate this
2011-05-02T07:22:50  <RossPatterson> dwight: What makes you think the test didn't run to completion?  RC can runs test very quickly.
2011-05-02T07:23:36  <dwight> well the test is much longer it ends half way through the first test case
2011-05-02T07:24:48  <dwight> i have the code to hand if this helps
2011-05-02T07:24:53  <RossPatterson> OK, that's a good measure :-)
2011-05-02T07:25:37  <dwight> ok let me get it
2011-05-02T07:26:14  <RossPatterson> Sorry, what I meant was "it ends half way through the first test case" is a good measure of whether the test completed.

2011-05-02T07:31:23  <RossPatterson> I'd expect the test to result in some sort of Exception if it terminates early - either an Assert.SomethingOrOther that JUnit catches and reports on or a Java run-time exception.  Either way, whatever UI you're using for JUnit should have displayed it for you.

2011-05-02T08:34:25  <DarkRift> is selenium 2 retro compatible with sel 1 ?
2011-05-02T08:37:37  <adamgoucher> yes, no, and maybe depending on who you ask and in what context
2011-05-02T08:38:25  <cgoldberg> adamgoucher, good answer :)
2011-05-02T08:38:43  * adamgoucher is a consultant...
2011-05-02T08:39:17  <adamgoucher> can you take your existing se-rc scripts and use it against a 2.x server? yes. and you should
2011-05-02T08:39:40  <adamgoucher> can you magically take your existing se-rc scripts and have them use webdriver goodness? no

2011-05-02T08:40:27  <adamgoucher> but is there a bridge to get you from rc to webdriver? if you are java or .net, then there exists a migration path
2011-05-02T08:40:57  <DarkRift> let me explain the complexity of my need
2011-05-02T08:40:57  <adamgoucher> ruby and python will be coming shortly (but there are some archicture changes behind the scenes that will happen first)
2011-05-02T08:41:23  <cgoldberg> DarkRift, depending on the complexity and size of your framework, porting to webdriver might not be so bad... I just ported a framework from sel 1 to webdriver
2011-05-02T08:41:56  <DarkRift> I didn't start anything yet other than a special IDE format
2011-05-02T08:41:59  <adamgoucher> of course, if you arent using an abstraction layer like cgoldberg's framework or page objects then there is more work
2011-05-02T08:42:09  <DarkRift> but then I just heard selenium IDE is for sel 1 and not 2

2011-05-02T09:32:01  *** victorp_ is now known as phDaemon
2011-05-02T09:39:22  <vmassol> idea for selenium devs: optionally display the page content when findElement() fails to find the element
2011-05-02T09:39:42  <vmassol> that would help a lot to diagnose problems
2011-05-02T09:41:46  <adamgoucher> or catch the elementnotfound exception and do it in your specific context at the approriate places
2011-05-02T09:41:46  *** frohoff has quit IRC
2011-05-02T09:42:11  <vmassol> sure this means replacing all calls of getDrvier().findElement() everywhere by our custom findElement
2011-05-02T09:42:18  <vmassol> and everyone has this need I believe
2011-05-02T09:42:42  <vmassol> IMO it's always good for a library to provide as much debug info as possible ;)
2011-05-02T09:42:52  *** csanchez has joined #selenium
2011-05-02T09:42:56  <vmassol> the problem with the exception strategy
2011-05-02T09:43:08  <vmassol> is that you have to get the page source *after*
2011-05-02T09:43:17  <vmassol> which won't work since time will have elapsed in betwee
2011-05-02T09:43:19  <vmassol> between
2011-05-02T09:43:53  *** frohoff has joined #selenium
2011-05-02T09:44:26  <vmassol> (and thus the element might be present in your log when the findElement operated on a different content where the element wasn't there)
2011-05-02T09:44:42  <jimevans> vmassol: the internal workings of the library will fall prey to the same potential race condition.
2011-05-02T09:44:42  *** frohoff has quit IRC
2011-05-02T09:45:23  <vmassol> jimevans: you could get the source before findElement executes so if it fails you know for sure that the element wasn't there and you get more info to debug
2011-05-02T09:45:41  <vmassol> I think it works better than getting the source after
2011-05-02T09:45:47  <vmassol> (safer)
2011-05-02T09:45:59  <jimevans> okay, but it's still possible that you're getting different page source than when you're executing findElement.
2011-05-02T09:46:05  <vmassol> yes
2011-05-02T09:46:05  <vmassol> agreed
2011-05-02T09:46:55  *** krosenvold has quit IRC
2011-05-02T09:47:20  *** frohoff has joined #selenium
2011-05-02T09:48:03  <freynaud> vmassol: the debug stuff is very much linked to how you work. As adamgoucher said, catch the exception, and get the source if you want
2011-05-02T09:48:16  <freynaud> other teams may need to get a screenshot for intance
2011-05-02T09:48:18  <freynaud> or both
2011-05-02T09:48:29  <freynaud> or something more fancy based on the test or so.
2011-05-02T09:48:55  <vmassol> freynaud: yes, this would be useful, it would be great if the exception contained the source before the find
2011-05-02T09:49:04  *** frohoff has left #selenium
2011-05-02T09:49:10  <jimevans> or, if you think getting the page source before calling findElement is more reliable, structure your test library appropriately.
2011-05-02T09:49:43  <freynaud> getting the source isn't free. That's pulling extra info that not everybody uses
2011-05-02T09:50:06  <vmassol> ok was wondering about how much it costs
2011-05-02T09:50:12  <freynaud> if you're using a remotewebdriver
2011-05-02T09:50:18  <vmassol> I thought maybe you already had it cached
2011-05-02T09:50:32  <vmassol> (in a variable)
2011-05-02T09:50:40  <freynaud> with the client and the server not on the same network, you will have the sources sent over the internet :)
2011-05-02T09:50:56  <freynaud> in a world of infinite bandwith, that's not a problem
2011-05-02T09:51:16  <jimevans> the driver does not cache such things. the driver fetches the value on-demand.
2011-05-02T09:51:22  <vmassol> ok
2011-05-02T09:51:27  *** krosenvold has joined #selenium
2011-05-02T09:52:04  <vmassol> so I guess I have to create a custom JUnit Test Runner to catch the exception....
2011-05-02T09:52:14  <jimevans> even if getting the page source were "free", sending that much data back down the wire would still be expensive.
2011-05-02T09:52:31  <jimevans> Even if the "wire" is only on the same machine.
2011-05-02T09:53:05  <freynaud> i'm not familiar with JUnit, more with testNG
2011-05-02T09:53:07  <vmassol> you could provide one though ;)
2011-05-02T09:53:17  <vmassol> a @RunWith(SeleniumRunner.class)
2011-05-02T09:53:20  <jimevans> if you're calling selenium/webdriver methods directly from your tests, you might want to look at adding a layer of abstaction using the PageObject pattern or similar.
2011-05-02T09:53:24  <freynaud> but i assume you're using some before and after method to start and close the driver
2011-05-02T09:53:33  <vmassol> I do use PO pattern
2011-05-02T09:53:34  <freynaud> when closing , check if there was an exception
2011-05-02T09:53:59  <freynaud> and in case that was a nosuchelement one, get the extra info you want, like url, source etc
2011-05-02T09:54:06  <vmassol> the exception is raised when it happens, not when closing right?
2011-05-02T09:54:21  <freynaud> correct. You'd do that before closing
2011-05-02T09:54:28  <freynaud> so that the browser is still open
2011-05-02T09:54:38  <vmassol> so the only solution I can see with junit4 is a custom runner
2011-05-02T09:54:58  <vmassol> it's not hard to write
2011-05-02T09:55:14  <vmassol> I can write it and contribute it if you find it useful
2011-05-02T09:55:17  <jimevans> i think you're overcomplicating this. at some point in your page objects, you have to call findElement() to locate the element.
2011-05-02T09:55:25  <vmassol> yep
2011-05-02T09:55:28  <freynaud> i don't know. I use testNG, and it has the exception attached in the afterInvocationListner.
2011-05-02T09:55:38  <freynaud> so I get it from there without writing custom stuff
2011-05-02T09:55:40  <vmassol> but I don't want to use try/catch everywehre
2011-05-02T09:55:46  <vmassol> I want that in one place only
2011-05-02T09:56:07  <vmassol> so that wherever it happens in any of the tests
2011-05-02T09:56:07  <jimevans> instead of directly calling findElement, create a new method "findElementWithSource()" in your library or something.
2011-05-02T09:56:10  <vmassol> I get the lgos
2011-05-02T09:56:18  <jimevans> simple find/replace.
2011-05-02T09:56:24  <vmassol> yes that's another soltuion which means rewriting thousands of tests
2011-05-02T09:56:34  <vmassol> I think a transpaernt solutiuon is better
2011-05-02T09:56:41  <vmassol> and you could provide it as a helper for your users

2011-05-02T09:56:45  <vmassol> it's clean

2011-05-02T09:56:50  <jimevans> if you're using the page object pattern, it shouldn't mean rewriting tests at all.
2011-05-02T09:56:56  <jimevans> that's what the pattern is supposed to do.
2011-05-02T09:57:01  <vmassol> yes sure
2011-05-02T09:57:06  <vmassol> but it has a lot of limitations

2011-05-02T09:57:20  <vmassol> which is why the code is littered with exceptions
2011-05-02T09:57:25  <jimevans> i don't see that to be true at all, but you're welcome to disagree.
2011-05-02T09:57:52  <vmassol> I'd love to know how to use the PO without having to write findElements
2011-05-02T09:57:58  <vmassol> in some cases we have
2011-05-02T09:58:09  <vmassol> I'll dig them
2011-05-02T09:58:50  <vmassol> basically it's when the condition is not known before the test executes I think
2011-05-02T09:59:15  <freynaud> you should really try http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#invokedmethodlistener
2011-05-02T09:59:32  <freynaud> the testResult contains everything about your test
2011-05-02T09:59:45  <freynaud> including the exception if there was any, in result.getThrowable
2011-05-02T09:59:56  <freynaud> so you don't need to propagate anything
2011-05-02T10:00:05  <freynaud> or handle the exception yourself
2011-05-02T10:00:11  <vmassol> hmm I can do the same in junit4.8 I think with the new Rule system
2011-05-02T10:00:20  <vmassol> that's a  possibility indeed
2011-05-02T10:00:34  <jimevans> guys, i'm sorry, that still seems really overcomplicated to me.
2011-05-02T10:00:57  *** krosenvold has joined #selenium
2011-05-02T10:00:59  <vmassol> what part?
2011-05-02T10:01:28  <vmassol> jimevans: I think I'm missing your point
2011-05-02T10:01:30  <jimevans> custom test runners, or relying on the rule system of junit.
2011-05-02T10:01:44  <vmassol> ok let's say I have full PO
2011-05-02T10:01:47  <jimevans> sure.
2011-05-02T10:02:07  <jimevans> where every page subclasses from some base page object.
2011-05-02T10:02:09  <vmassol> when do the WebElement objects get filled with the values?
2011-05-02T10:02:18  <vmassol> for ex
2011-05-02T10:02:19  <vmassol>     @FindBy(id = "update")
2011-05-02T10:02:19  <vmassol>     private WebElement objectForm;
2011-05-02T10:02:41  <vmassol> ok I remember
2011-05-02T10:02:43  <vmassol>         ElementLocatorFactory finder = new AjaxElementLocatorFactory(this.getDriver(), getUtil().getTimeout());
2011-05-02T10:02:44  <vmassol>         PageFactory.initElements(finder, this);
2011-05-02T10:02:47  <jimevans> ah, you're using the Page Factory, then.
2011-05-02T10:03:03  <jimevans> (which isn't required to implement Page Objects).
2011-05-02T10:03:03  <vmassol> yes
2011-05-02T10:03:08  <vmassol> (ok)
2011-05-02T10:03:17  <jimevans> this is exactly why I wouldn't rely on it.
2011-05-02T10:03:45  <jarib> couldn't you write your own ElementLocatorFactory that does fetch the source?

2011-05-02T11:18:16  <jimevans> no, i mean that you must be running Chrome 12.0.712.0 or higher, you must have the ChromeDriver executable downloaded, and it must be on your path.
2011-05-02T11:19:07  <jimevans> the wiki page is pretty clear.
2011-05-02T11:19:53  <jimevans> if the ChromeDriver.exe is on your path, you only need to call WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

2011-05-02T12:18:07  <krosenvold> But we did not need it because we force a single client thread
2011-05-02T12:18:16  <freynaud> the part i don't get
2011-05-02T12:18:22  <freynaud> is how the previous code failed

2011-05-02T12:28:46  <freynaud> ha, cool
2011-05-02T12:28:48  <freynaud> why ?
2011-05-02T12:29:00  <krosenvold> The bug in the old client is when you ned DefaultHttpClient()
2011-05-02T12:29:03  <krosenvold> s/ned/new
2011-05-02T12:29:36  <krosenvold> That's where you do thread-unsafe operations, the first one
2011-05-02T12:29:49  <freynaud> to get the params ?
2011-05-02T12:29:54  <krosenvold> Yes
2011-05-02T12:30:16  <krosenvold> Those suckers may seem like value objects but they're definitely not
2011-05-02T12:30:25  <freynaud> how is DefaultHttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient(); not thread  safe ?
2011-05-02T12:30:44  <krosenvold> Again, from the manual
2011-05-02T12:30:56  <krosenvold>  new DefaultHttpClient(connManager,params); *is* threadsafe
2011-05-02T12:31:08  <krosenvold> as long as connManager is a TSCCM
2011-05-02T12:31:22  <freynaud> right, and it default to single
2011-05-02T12:31:23  <freynaud> pff
2011-05-02T12:31:30  <krosenvold> pff
2011-05-02T12:31:34  <freynaud> i thought i was covered by the syncro block
2011-05-02T12:31:56  <krosenvold> Oh, didnt see that
2011-05-02T12:32:08  <krosenvold> You may not be
2011-05-02T12:32:20  <krosenvold> This gets real murky
2011-05-02T12:32:57  <freynaud> i was using a defaulthttpclient to get the params
2011-05-02T12:33:07  <freynaud> when new BasicHttpparam does the same thing
2011-05-02T12:33:12  <freynaud> the later is cleaner
2011-05-02T12:34:10  <krosenvold> I *think* the synchronized itself is not enough, because the thread-unsafe version does not capture lifecylce events that happen later. If so the copy of params is probably not being accessed properly later in the code. Wild guess
2011-05-02T12:34:18  <freynaud> maybe some of the params were 'corrupted' and contained some values linked to SingleClientConnManager
2011-05-02T12:34:51  <krosenvold> That'd be my guess too
2011-05-02T12:35:05  <freynaud> ok, now try to explain that :)
2011-05-02T12:35:25  <freynaud> on line 216
2011-05-02T12:35:26  <freynaud> DefaultHttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient(connManager,params);
2011-05-02T12:35:33  <freynaud> if you get rid of the param completly
2011-05-02T12:35:48  <freynaud> so default to singleclient manager

2011-05-02T12:36:50  <freynaud> i agree with the tainted param
2011-05-02T12:37:00  <freynaud> but if i don't use any param for the client
2011-05-02T12:37:14  <freynaud> then it should default to singleClientConnMgr
2011-05-02T12:37:17  <krosenvold> It will do it correctly by itself
2011-05-02T12:37:28  <freynaud> and that should crash for grid

2011-05-02T12:39:21  <freynaud> good naming convention always help :)
2011-05-02T12:39:57  <freynaud> so you recieve a POST with the content body {ID , '8'} for instance
2011-05-02T12:40:02  <freynaud> that goes through properly

2011-05-02T13:52:32  <mashiara> I have no idea how the grid works internally but I would suppose you can use either API with it too
2011-05-02T13:52:41  <meder> seems like there's something on http://www.synchtube.com/r/Y4Wh which makes it not work entirely

2011-05-02T14:52:00  *** jimevans has quit IRC
2011-05-02T14:52:08  <jarib> so their browser support/functionality is roughly equivalent
2011-05-02T14:52:24  <jarib> which means it's more a matter of personal taste, API-wise
2011-05-02T14:53:07  <sdimkov> so if I understand right, selenium webdriver gives direct webdriver api, while watir adds another layer i.e. watir's api
2011-05-02T14:53:15  <jarib> correct
2011-05-02T14:53:29  <jarib> watir-webdriver is using selenium-webdriver under the hood.

2011-05-02T14:56:13  <jarib> not a lot

2011-05-02T14:59:28  <jarib> i see
2011-05-02T15:00:10  <sdimkov> it has lots of ajax so selenium1 or functional testing won't be enough
