2011-03-15T09:26:45  <csgeek> I presume selenium isn't supporting FF4 since its not even out as a stable release yet?

2011-03-15T09:27:55  <csgeek> okay... here's another question.. If I have FF crash on an active session.. is there a way to recover from that?
2011-03-15T09:27:57  <csgeek> cleanly
2011-03-15T09:28:00  <antlong> alp82, contains was technically not supposed to work
2011-03-15T09:28:21  <csgeek> ideally I'd like to capture an exception.. close the session, and initiate a new one once more
2011-03-15T09:29:05  <alp82> antlong:  ok, maybe i can use xpath selectors then
2011-03-15T09:29:17  <jimevans> csgeek: i could be wrong, but i don't think you can get there from here, at least not yet.
2011-03-15T09:29:33  <alp82> like this: "//div[contains(text(), 'Save')]"
2011-03-15T09:29:45  <csgeek> there from here?
2011-03-15T09:29:57  <alp82> fails too: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//div[contains(text(), 'Save')]"}
2011-03-15T09:29:58  <antlong> csgeek, start_client() / stop_client()
2011-03-15T09:30:17  <csgeek> sure.. I meant is there an exception thrown I could capture upon a FF crash
2011-03-15T09:30:19  <antlong> alp82, thats a more basic query, its probably you
2011-03-15T09:30:26  <csgeek> I know I can stop/start the FF client
2011-03-15T09:30:32  <jimevans> csgeek: meaning, you can't do what you want, at least not yet. I'm not sure the exception you're looking for will be properly thrown.
2011-03-15T09:30:43  <jimevans> but again, i could be wrong.
2011-03-15T09:30:57  <antlong> csgeek, yeah WebDriverException most likely
2011-03-15T09:31:11  <antlong> but it could be one of many, defined in the exceptions module
2011-03-15T09:31:15  <csgeek> yeah.. I'm being faily abusive to my machine... and it seems to not only bring down FF but bring down the entire VNC session + xorg
2011-03-15T09:31:31  <alp82> antlong:  do you know how i could easily find elements that match a query for their inner text?
2011-03-15T09:31:51  <antlong> alp82, //*[contains(text(), 'Foo')]
2011-03-15T09:32:32  <antlong> csgeek look at the exceptions file, and use the appropriate exception where needed
2011-03-15T09:33:20  <alp82> antlong:  ah ok i misinterpreted the previous error. thanks a lot

2011-03-15T12:57:14  <andytinkham> I've got an encoding question in ruby. I'm trying to read data out of a database (where there are records which contain non-ASCII characters). When I try to send a value from one of these records using Se2b2, I get "incompatible encoding regexp match (UTF-8 regexp string with ASCII-8BIT string). Am I interpreting this correctly in that I'm getting ASCII-8BIT from my database, but Se is expecting UTF-8 in this case?
2011-03-15T13:00:05  *** Kn|t3 has joined #selenium
2011-03-15T13:00:25  <antlong> from your 2nd sentence, i would surmise you have utf-8 in the database
2011-03-15T13:00:36  <antlong> but you can easily print str.encoding and see
2011-03-15T13:00:39  <andytinkham> antlong: That's my intention :)
2011-03-15T13:01:23  <andytinkham> I'm definitely getting ASCII-8BIT from the db (after checking with .encoding)
2011-03-15T13:01:36  <antlong> so force_encode to utf-8
2011-03-15T13:04:21  <andytinkham> Hmmm, sounds like what I want, but when I try to send_keys the result of force_encoding, I get an invalid byte sequence in UTF-8. I can do the force_encoding outside of the send_keys without a problem
2011-03-15T13:04:43  <antlong> try unicode
2011-03-15T13:04:54  <antlong> jarib would be better for this problem than i

2011-03-15T13:05:55  <jimevans> let me try again.
2011-03-15T13:06:08  <andytinkham> antlong: I didn't have them in Ruby until 1.9 :) Still wrapping my head around the changes there. Unfortunately force_encoding "unicode" and force_encoding "Unicode" both result in unknown encoding name errors
2011-03-15T13:06:27  <antlong> andytinkham, unicode might be under a different name
2011-03-15T13:06:59  <jimevans> I'm assuming most of the problems you're talking about are with IE?
2011-03-15T13:07:32  <antlong> yeah just IE, theres a few tickets ive seen and a handful of people who've come in here with issues loading the browser and the fix included toggle UAC
2011-03-15T13:07:58  <jimevans> Okay, since 2.0b1 came out, I can't think of an instance where the solution has been to disable UAC. Can you?
2011-03-15T13:08:00  <True-Blue> Thanks for the link antlog, it'll take me awhile to still figure out.  I've found a couple of people who have had the same problem though.  Basically there is a tabbed menu that I need to click a link under

2011-03-15T13:12:15  <jimevans> antlong: The reason I'm confused is that I thought we'd removed the requirement for elevation with the IE driver rewrite introduced in 2.0b1.
2011-03-15T13:12:21  *** cburroughs has quit IRC
2011-03-15T13:12:24  <jimevans> Indeed, that was one of the main motivations for the rewrite.
2011-03-15T13:13:14  <antlong> jimevans, hmn im not too sure, but there's been a few people in here since then that were running in to problems opening the initial webpage. they had UAC on, and turning it off made the page load.
2011-03-15T13:13:54  <antlong> i guess it depends on the permission level of the account, maybe they had their security settings on the low (restrictive) end initially
2011-03-15T13:14:03  <jimevans> Yes, but did they set their Protected Mode settings to the same value for all zones and that not work?
2011-03-15T13:14:54  <jimevans> Rather than disabling UAC (which they can't do if they're not an admin), we should be steering people to change Protected Mode settings.
2011-03-15T13:16:05  <jimevans> Yes, elevating to an admin or disabling UAC would solve the problem, since it disables Protected Mode completely,
2011-03-15T13:16:17  <jimevans> but it's a bit like using a sledgehammer to hang a picture on the wall.
2011-03-15T13:16:44  <antlong> heh, it would probably rectify other issues though, wouldnt sendFile also be a problem with UAC on?
2011-03-15T13:17:27  <jimevans> I've no idea how it affects the 1.x API. My changes were strictly confined to the 2.0 (WebDriver) API.

2011-03-15T15:12:40  <jarib> [23:14]   jimevans : i'll be checking twitter and email fairly constantly over the next two hours or so, then hop back on here after dinner.
2011-03-15T15:12:42  <simonstewart> Just came out of a tech talk.

2011-03-15T15:13:54  <simonstewart> Hi jimevans
2011-03-15T15:13:57  <simonstewart> Reading your email now
2011-03-15T15:14:03  <jimevans> simonstewart: Great b
2011-03-15T15:14:11  <andytinkham> jarib: I get the same EOFError in the bug. (So, today, I was using irb to investigate things. Everything was working fine, then I closed all windows (through win7's taskbar context menu). After that, even in the same irb session, if I tried to create a new instance of the driver class, the window would appear, but the call to Selenium::WebDriver.for resulted in that EOFError
2011-03-15T15:14:15  <jimevans> Or even great.

2011-03-15T15:14:34  <simonstewart> Would you like a reply here? Or in email?
2011-03-15T15:14:38  <simonstewart> Either's good with me :)
2011-03-15T15:14:49  <simonstewart> Also, awesome :)
2011-03-15T15:14:54  <jimevans> I'm fine with either.
2011-03-15T15:15:09  <jimevans> :)
2011-03-15T15:15:13  <simonstewart> OK. I'll reply here and when I then properly by email
2011-03-15T15:15:19  <simonstewart> So, the basic messaging:
2011-03-15T15:15:30  <simonstewart> Selenium 2 is the merging of Selenium and WebDriver
2011-03-15T15:15:30  <jimevans> Good. Go ahead.
2011-03-15T15:15:31  <jarib> andytinkham: i'm not really any wiser than last time. did any of the UAC stuff change? (could happen if your system is managed remotely maybe?)
2011-03-15T15:15:36  *** fuzzygroove has left #selenium
2011-03-15T15:15:37  <jarib> since that solved it last time.
2011-03-15T15:15:46  <jarib> or at least seems to have
2011-03-15T15:16:00  <simonstewart> The Selenium brand is like "Mac OS" and "RC/Selenium 1" like Carbon and "WebDriver" like Cocoa
2011-03-15T15:16:02  *** reddeviL is now known as reddevil
2011-03-15T15:16:16  <simonstewart> We're bumping the version number of the entire project because it's a biiig change
2011-03-15T15:16:26  <jimevans> Right.
2011-03-15T15:16:33  <simonstewart> Selenium 1 reached the 80/20 point because it's a JS app
2011-03-15T15:16:39  <andytinkham> It seems unlikely that it changed (my IT guy stays pretty hands-off my machines), but it's possible. I'm more checking just in case you had come up with anything else that might be related that should be checked or preserved before I wipe it, rather than seeing if this install can be fied
2011-03-15T15:16:48  <simonstewart> But, as a JS app, it's constrained by the security model of browsers
2011-03-15T15:16:59  <jimevans> Sure.
2011-03-15T15:17:00  <simonstewart> In The Old Days this didn't matter so much
2011-03-15T15:17:13  <simonstewart> But apps are getting richer, and demanding greater fidelity of user input
2011-03-15T15:17:14  <jarib> andytinkham: you're the only person to ever report this issue AFAIK
2011-03-15T15:17:33  <simonstewart> WebDriver integrates tightly with a browser
2011-03-15T15:17:45  <simonstewart> (Using COM Automation for IE, extensions for Firefox, etc)
2011-03-15T15:17:51  <simonstewart> As such, it's _not_ in the sandbox
2011-03-15T15:17:55  <jarib> simonstewart, jimevans: what's up?
2011-03-15T15:18:02  <simonstewart> and can do all sorts of interesting things
2011-03-15T15:18:07  <jarib> andytinkham: for 2), can you gist me the stacktrace?
2011-03-15T15:18:17  <simonstewart> jimevans wanted to know the "messaging" around selenium 2
2011-03-15T15:18:19  <jimevans> Ok. Great.
2011-03-15T15:18:24  <andytinkham> jarib: And I've only experienced it on this one machine, so I'm fairly certain that it's something specific to the machine (which was inherited from a VP when I started here, so not sure what was done before I got it). In the absence of anything to preserve, I'll get it wiped and reinstall things and see if it goes away
2011-03-15T15:18:34  <simonstewart> "interesting things" such as file uploads and accurate user input at the OS level
2011-03-15T15:18:49  <jarib> andytinkham: sigh..sorry it's not smoother for you
2011-03-15T15:18:51  <jimevans> Got it.
2011-03-15T15:18:55  <simonstewart> So our drag and drop emulation when using native events is wicked :)
2011-03-15T15:19:02  <simonstewart> s/wicked/very good/
2011-03-15T15:19:05  <jimevans> Yes. :)
2011-03-15T15:19:18  <simonstewart> The problem that people have is that they've already made a massive investment in Selenium
2011-03-15T15:19:23  <simonstewart> How do they get from 1 to 2?
2011-03-15T15:19:31  <simonstewart> The answer is the webdriver-backed selenium stuff
2011-03-15T15:19:37  <jimevans> Right.
2011-03-15T15:19:41  <andytinkham> jarib: No worries. Who knows what the VP did to the machine - it's probably his fault. :)
2011-03-15T15:19:43  <simonstewart> which allows a team to make a piecemeal migration
2011-03-15T15:19:49  <andytinkham> jarib: And I'll get the gist in just a second
2011-03-15T15:20:10  <simonstewart> The approach I've been advocating is that team switch how selenium is built (from DefaultSelenium to WebDriverBacked)
2011-03-15T15:20:20  <simonstewart> fix up the tests (because the emulation ain't perfect)
2011-03-15T15:20:34  <simonstewart> and then as they edit files, do the migration on a file-level
2011-03-15T15:20:47  <simonstewart> Until there's so little v1 code left, it can be done in a "small bang"
2011-03-15T15:20:55  * jarib is curious about the context for jim and simon's conversation
2011-03-15T15:20:59  <jimevans> I see. Fair enough.
2011-03-15T15:21:09  <simonstewart> jarib: talking to MS :)
2011-03-15T15:21:15  <jarib> ah!
2011-03-15T15:21:24  <simonstewart> The long-term goal of the project is to create a browser automation standard
2011-03-15T15:21:24  <jarib> fantastic
2011-03-15T15:21:40  <simonstewart> Because it's crazy that a small team of developers (< 10 really active people)
2011-03-15T15:21:49  <simonstewart> should be trying to support every browser on every platform
2011-03-15T15:21:59  <jarib> andytinkham: after force_encoding the string, check if it's valid with .valid_encoding?
2011-03-15T15:22:01  <simonstewart> Mozilla have already agreed with the basic approach
2011-03-15T15:22:06  <simonstewart> Opera have released their OperaDriver
2011-03-15T15:22:17  <simonstewart> And the next release of Chrome has support for WebDriver available
2011-03-15T15:22:25  <simonstewart> via code developed in the Chromium tree
2011-03-15T15:22:36  <jimevans> Excellent.
2011-03-15T15:22:37  <jarib> andytinkham: if that returns false, then your assumption about receiving UTF-8 data from the db is incorrect
2011-03-15T15:22:43  <andytinkham> jarib: Actually, I can't get the full gist quickly (I'd deleted the database  to try recreating it). The error was at line 374 in lib\selenium\webdriver\remote\bridge.rb (          execute :sendKeysToElement, {:id => element}, {:value => string.split(//u)})
2011-03-15T15:22:47  <simonstewart> Better still, there's a fortunate confluence
2011-03-15T15:22:56  <simonstewart> where the OSS tools are consolidating on to the webdriver tech
2011-03-15T15:23:02  <andytinkham> jarib: I'm getting ASCII-8BIT from the db
2011-03-15T15:23:08  <simonstewart> as that provides a handy mechanism for controlling a browser
2011-03-15T15:23:19  <simonstewart> while leaving the projects able to "innovate at the API level:
2011-03-15T15:23:32  <jarib> andytinkham: hmm
2011-03-15T15:23:55  <jarib> andytinkham: trying to remember why i added the u flag there
2011-03-15T15:23:57  <simonstewart> As such, the standard will be composed of an API (WebDriver), an SPI (the remote's Command/Response and mappings) and a reference implementation (the Http/Json stuff)
2011-03-15T15:23:57  * jimevans thanks the gods for irc logs.
2011-03-15T15:24:03  <simonstewart> hahaha
2011-03-15T15:24:09  <simonstewart> I'll be cutting and pasting :)
2011-03-15T15:24:19  <andytinkham> Oh, the db drop didn't go through, so I still have it. Just a sec
2011-03-15T15:24:33  <simonstewart> And I _think_ that's enough to get you going
2011-03-15T15:24:37  *** reddevil is now known as reddeviL
2011-03-15T15:24:43  <jarib> andytinkham: stacktrace isn't important, that line is enough
2011-03-15T15:24:44  <simonstewart> Anything else you need?
2011-03-15T15:24:47  <jimevans> I'm about to wander out of wifi range and colloquy mobile hasn't landed sasl support yet.
2011-03-15T15:24:52  <jarib> andytinkham: more interested in the string you're trying to send
2011-03-15T15:25:05  <andytinkham> "Hallbjörnsson"
2011-03-15T15:25:05  <jimevans> No that'll get me started. I look forward to the email.
2011-03-15T15:25:14  <simonstewart> It'll be a log of this IRC chat
2011-03-15T15:25:21  <jimevans> Thanks simonstewart!
2011-03-15T15:25:25  <simonstewart> I might share a page from a sight too
2011-03-15T15:25:25  <jarib> andytinkham: does it have non-ASCII in it?
2011-03-15T15:25:27  <simonstewart> No worries
2011-03-15T15:25:34  <simonstewart> s/sight/site/
2011-03-15T15:25:36  <jarib> it probably does.
2011-03-15T15:25:48  <andytinkham> In the middle, right after the j is an o with an umlaut
2011-03-15T15:25:50  <jimevans> Til later
2011-03-15T15:26:08  <simonstewart> Later
2011-03-15T15:26:13  <simonstewart> I'll be offline for a few hours
2011-03-15T15:28:15  <andytinkham> jarib: The string shows up in irb after I've retrieved it from the db as "Hallbj\xF6rnsson" but the length indicates it's still treating \xF6 as a single character. Not sure if that matters or if it's just irb dealing with a windows dos box
2011-03-15T15:28:49  <jarib> andytinkham: that's ISO-8859-1
2011-03-15T15:29:30  <selbot2_> jmleyba less than 20 seconds ago - JasonLeyba: Do not hard code test server port. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11695
2011-03-15T15:29:44  <andytinkham> If I call .encoding on the value, it reports "ASCII-8BIT"
2011-03-15T15:29:53  <jarib> andytinkham: right. that's wrong
2011-03-15T15:29:59  <jarib> \xF6 isn't an ascii character
2011-03-15T15:30:18  <jarib> so the hacky solution would be .force_encoding("ISO-8859-1").encode("UTF-8") before sending it webdriver
2011-03-15T15:30:26  *** jimevans has quit IRC
2011-03-15T15:33:18  <jarib> andytinkham: i'll need to look into why we just assume UTF-8
2011-03-15T15:34:33  <andytinkham> jarib: Hmmm, here's another data point. If I iterate over the chars straight from the database, and puts each one out individually, I get a "÷" for the "ö". If I do it with your solution, I get "├╢" Different, but still not the ö
2011-03-15T15:34:45  *** True-Blue has quit IRC
2011-03-15T15:35:11  <andytinkham> (and if those characters didn't come through - the first way is the division sign, the second seems to be an "H" but made from two characters
2011-03-15T15:35:15  <jarib> andytinkham: your shell probably doesn't support UTF-8
2011-03-15T15:35:25  <andytinkham> This could well be :)
2011-03-15T15:35:49  <jarib> what if you just   puts str.force_encoding("ISO-8859-1")
2011-03-15T15:37:05  <andytinkham> I get the division sign
2011-03-15T15:37:16  <jarib> k
2011-03-15T15:37:47  <jarib> andytinkham: do you get the expected result in the browser if you hack the gem and remove the "u" from //u ?
2011-03-15T15:38:25  <andytinkham> Unsure. Don't have a browser I can drive on this machine at the moment since FF stopped working and I installed IE9 today not thinking about Se support
2011-03-15T15:38:59  <jarib> ugh
2011-03-15T15:39:22  <andytinkham> Yeah. Sorry :/ I'm working on getting the ODBC driver set up on my mac so I can try it there
2011-03-15T15:40:06  <jarib> the best solution would be if you got strings from the DB tagged with the actual encoding
2011-03-15T15:40:30  *** csanchez has quit IRC
2011-03-15T15:41:04  <jarib> and then if we really need UTF-8 on the webdriver side (which I should look into), we should also call .encode for you (i.e. assume you're sending in a string with the correct encoding)
2011-03-15T15:41:38  <jarib> andytinkham: you're using sequel?
2011-03-15T15:41:47  <andytinkham> Yeah
2011-03-15T15:42:21  <andytinkham> Trying to use it, at least. When I try to retrieve the last name from my database on the mac, I get a "string contains a null byte" error.
2011-03-15T15:42:45  <simonstewart> jarib: you've got the docs too
2011-03-15T15:43:21  <jarib> simonstewart: cool, thanks
2011-03-15T15:43:27  <andytinkham> Basically, the entire db usage is up in the air though. I need to query SQL Servers, and I'm trying to store some test data in a database and use that. I need to access this from both mac and pc. I don't really care how I achieve it, though, so long as I get there somehow
2011-03-15T15:45:02  *** simonstewart has quit IRC
2011-03-15T15:45:12  <andytinkham> It's unlikely that the app databases will have much in the way of non-ASCII characters, and I'd like to set up the test data I'm using to include some so we can make sure they work. Realistically though, how many rural US doctors and nurses are going to take the time to enter characterss they can't type on their keyboards so if it can't be made to work, it's probably OK
2011-03-15T15:45:36  *** simonstewart has joined #selenium
2011-03-15T15:47:52  <jarib> ok. not the decision i'd make, but then again i'm not familiar with your setup :)
2011-03-15T15:47:55  <jarib> what db do you use?
2011-03-15T15:48:12  <jarib> i notice sequel has an :encoding setting for mysql
2011-03-15T15:48:45  <andytinkham> Which is not the decision you'd make? Skipping non-ASCII characters? (That's more a decision of last resort, and if it does happen, I'll make sure we have manual tests for it)
2011-03-15T15:49:04  <andytinkham> I'm using SQL Server, through ODBC. No :encoding setting for Sequel, unfortunately
2011-03-15T15:50:31  <jarib> andytinkham: i'd try hard to keep the encoding consistent in the db
2011-03-15T15:50:33  <jarib> ideally use utf-8
2011-03-15T15:50:41  <jarib> perhaps i misread you
2011-03-15T15:51:05  <andytinkham> I think the database is UTF-8. SQL Server Manager is showing the characters correctly when I open the table
2011-03-15T15:51:31  <andytinkham> (but that is why I was trying to drop the db earlier. I was going to re-create it and look at every option to see if I saw something I missed the first time)
2011-03-15T15:52:58  <andytinkham> I would love to find a non-ODBC method that gives me more control, but I'm stuck with SQL server, and everything I've looked at for ruby libraries seems to not like that db much
2011-03-15T15:53:42  <andytinkham> My test data could possibly be put in another db though. Maybe I should see about getting MySQL set up for that and see what sort of reaction gets provoked if I ask about that
2011-03-15T15:54:29  <jarib> andytinkham: windows stuff usually prefers CP1250/ISO-8859-1 IME. and that's what \xF6 is. so ideally you'd get odbc/sequel to not treat it as binary
2011-03-15T15:55:02  <jarib> but return strings tagged with the correct encoding
2011-03-15T15:55:31  <andytinkham> Is there a way to tell whether the ISO-8859-1 encoding was introduced by sequel/odbc/the database and not just irb in a dos box?
2011-03-15T15:55:59  <jarib> not that i know of
2011-03-15T15:56:10  *** stephend|mtg has quit IRC
2011-03-15T15:56:26  <jarib> andytinkham: what does Encoding.default_external return?

2011-03-15T15:58:52  <andytinkham> I did try to take my variable with the database string and write it out to a text file. Notepad shows the umlautted o correctly, so Ruby does have it right internally, it seems.
2011-03-15T15:59:31  <andytinkham> (For the record, Encoding.default_internal returns nil)
2011-03-15T16:00:05  <jarib> andytinkham: well, the actual bytes aren't wrong, it's just the string's encoding tag
2011-03-15T16:00:44  <jarib> IBM437 =~ CP1250/ISO-8859-1 IIRC
2011-03-15T16:00:49  *** stephendonner has joined #selenium
2011-03-15T16:01:28  <jarib> i guess sequel is throwing up its hands and saying "treating this as binary" at some point

2011-03-15T17:17:39  <keturn> although someone in here did have a slightly different technique recently they claimed worked

2011-03-15T17:24:07  <antlong> ss23, you have to use java keycodes
2011-03-15T17:25:15  <ss23> Which are?
2011-03-15T17:25:47  <antlong> theyre defined in java. theres one for each letter,  check on google.
2011-03-15T17:25:55  <antlong> probably VK_TAB though

2011-03-15T17:32:20  <ss23> antlong: Sorry, everything that I'm finding seems to be confirming what I've found so far. Looking at http://www.cloudtesting.com/selenium-docs/1.0.1/selenium-php-client-driver/Selenium/Testing_Selenium.html#methodkeyPressNative just tells me not to use Java key codes
2011-03-15T17:32:40  <antlong> no.
2011-03-15T17:32:48  <antlong> it doesnt say that anywhere
2011-03-15T17:33:20  <ss23> Oh, sorry misread

2011-03-15T17:42:16  <ss23> antlong: I've been playing around, but I still can't figure it out. keyPressNative takes an integer, so I tried the string (a string in my PHP) of VK_TAB, assuming it would be interpreted as an integer on the server side, but I get ERROR: Problem during keyDown: For input string: "VK_TAB".
2011-03-15T17:42:52  <antlong> i dont know php. try ord('VK_TAB') or such
2011-03-15T17:43:44  <ss23> VK_TAB isn't a constant in PHP, so that won't work. As for the ascii value of the tab character, that's 9
2011-03-15T17:43:55  <ss23> Trying an integer like 9 doesn't seem to do anything, but I don't get an error
2011-03-15T17:44:13  <antlong> it has to be a java keycode
2011-03-15T17:44:21  *** dhackner has quit IRC
2011-03-15T17:44:24  *** ian_mac has joined #selenium
2011-03-15T17:46:00  <ss23> Yes, I know, hence why I thought that VK_TAB would be interpreted as the correct keycode on the Java side. It gives an error, but 9 doesn't. I'm not all that familiar with Java, but if VK_TAB is just a constant with an integer value, perhaps I could use that value here? Do you happen to know hwat it is?
2011-03-15T17:46:08  <antlong> also you probably have to use KeyEvent.VK_TAB
2011-03-15T17:46:27  <antlong> its not a constant unless you see it defined somewhere
2011-03-15T17:52:31  <ss23> antlong: It's only accepting integer values. Any others give me the same ERROR: Problem during keyDown: For input string: "foo". Integers over a certain value give me "ERROR: Problem during keyDown: Invalid key code."
2011-03-15T17:52:51  <antlong> ok because foo is not a valid key
2011-03-15T17:53:33  *** sephinroth has joined #selenium
2011-03-15T17:53:38  <antlong> look at the docs, it doesnt take a loctor, you pass it a java keycode and it simulates that key being pressed
2011-03-15T17:54:15  <ss23> Okay, so what do you suggest I pass it for the tab key? KeyEvent.VK_TAB gives me that error, VK_TAB gives me that error, 9 gives me unexpected results.
2011-03-15T17:54:28  <ss23> I have no idea what you mean by "java keycode" in this context
2011-03-15T17:54:35  <ss23> PHP has no concept of java keycodes
2011-03-15T17:54:52  <antlong> whats selenium-server
2011-03-15T17:54:59  <antlong> aka selenium rc
2011-03-15T17:55:15  <ss23> Sorry what?
2011-03-15T17:55:34  <antlong> what language is selenium rc written in
2011-03-15T17:55:50  <ss23> Java I assume, but I'm not sure what that has to do with this
2011-03-15T17:56:03  <antlong> where would you think the java keycode would come from
2011-03-15T17:56:35  <antlong> the php code is just sending commands to the jar file
2011-03-15T17:56:55  <antlong> google php keypressnative(vk_tab)
2011-03-15T17:57:08  <ss23> Okay, so the PHP code needs to send an integer referring to VK_TAB right? Which is what I'm trying to do
2011-03-15T17:57:20  <ss23> However, PHP has no such thing as VK_TAB...
2011-03-15T17:57:45  <antlong> ok
2011-03-15T17:57:50  <antlong> just google the above
2011-03-15T17:58:21  <ss23> I see lots of Java code, but none of it seems relevant given the circumstances
2011-03-15T18:01:17  <antlong> did you read the docs i linked
2011-03-15T18:01:41  <antlong> it says 'This function uses the java.awt.Robot class to send a keystroke... To send a keystroke to a particular element, focus on the element first before running this command.'
2011-03-15T18:02:17  <ss23> Yes, I'm focused on the element I want to use, but once again, I'm not sure how thats relevant
2011-03-15T18:02:35  <antlong> how dont you understand? its the php docs on the function youre trying to use.
2011-03-15T18:04:21  <ss23> antlong: Well, I've spend ~3 hours trying to get this one line to work, reading various things, and talking to you, and it's still not working. I'm pretty sure that means I don't understand how to do it. If you have a suggestion for what the line should be, other than your previous suggestions of VK_TAB etc that didn't work, feel free to suggest something else, but nothing I've tried so far has worked
