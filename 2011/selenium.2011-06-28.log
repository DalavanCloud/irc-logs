2011-06-28T01:19:45  <ksinkar> how do you achieve that in webdriver?
2011-06-28T01:19:57  <jarib> driver.find_element(:id => "login").click
2011-06-28T01:20:04  <jarib> maybe?
2011-06-28T01:20:16  <ksinkar> jarib: not the element has no id
2011-06-28T01:20:20  <jarib> or driver.find_element(:link_text => "login").click
2011-06-28T01:20:31  <ksinkar> it is just <a href="/login">
2011-06-28T01:20:52  <ksinkar> let me check in irb
2011-06-28T01:22:24  <jarib> link = driver.find_elements(:tag_name => "a").find { |e| e.attribute("href").to_s.include? "login" }
2011-06-28T01:23:16  <jarib> usually an element surrounding the anchor has a class/id you can use to identify it
2011-06-28T01:24:01  <jarib> so you don't have to find all the anchors on the page every time.

2011-06-28T01:42:35  <jarib> i think older versions don't catch Timeout::Error; so if that's what selenium-client is throwing, you may have problems

2011-06-28T01:57:50  <jds> One of the reasons I was trying chrome was due to a firefox security warning which is causing me problems.  My tests load an https iframe from a 3rd party, which contains a form that's submitted back to my server.  In testing, that server isn't running ssl, so Firefox pops up a warning, which I have to manually click on to continue testing
2011-06-28T01:58:59  <jds> I sort of worked around it by running nginx to proxy all the testing traffic and provide a self signed ssl cert, and tweaking /etc/hosts to add a local server url, but that's making my tests a lot less self contained than I'd like.  Any better suggestions?

Would the correct approach simply be to remove the findBy* methods in OperaDriver, and fall back to RemoteWebDriver?  Or am I missing something?

2011-06-28T02:15:00  <jarib> ato: RemoteWebDriver just does RPC, it doesn't touch any JS stuff at all
2011-06-28T02:16:08  <ato> So how would I go about this then?
2011-06-28T02:16:20  <jds> jarib: Firefox pops up a modal sheet saying "Although this page is encrypted, the information you have entered is to be sent over an unencrypted connection and could easily be read by a third party.  Are you sure you want to continue sending this information?  <Cancel> <Continue>"
2011-06-28T02:17:07  <jarib> jds: hmm, ok

2011-06-28T02:20:08  <jarib> ato: you're the first to do a pure-Java driver based on the atoms, so you probably want to start by compiling the atoms you want to e.g. Atoms.java with a bunch of String constants containing the JS code
2011-06-28T02:20:45  <jds> jarib: Yeah, it's been a total pain in the ass
2011-06-28T02:21:59  <ato> jarib: Aha, of course.  Stupid me.  I was trying to figure out where RemoteWebDriver actually did the queryâ€¦ (=
2011-06-28T02:22:35  *** csanchez has joined #selenium

2011-06-28T02:23:31  <ato> What would be the right place to put a generated atoms Java file?  In Selenium or OperaDriver?
2011-06-28T02:23:32  <jarib> RemoteWebDriver basically just maps the WebDriver API to a list of commands (the SPI)
2011-06-28T02:24:10  <jarib> the generated file would need to be in OperaDriver
2011-06-28T02:25:40  <jarib> but generated from the selenium tree, obviously. just like chrome does with their atoms

2011-06-28T06:41:58  <jimevans> the build target for the build system is 'go //dotnet'
2011-06-28T06:42:21  <tomh-> ah ok
2011-06-28T06:42:30  <tomh-> what kind of build system is that?
2011-06-28T06:44:03  <RossPatterson> simonstewart calls it "CrazyFun".  I call it "HeadExploder" :-)
2011-06-28T06:45:25  <tomh-> hehe
2011-06-28T06:45:50  <ato> I'm hacking on CrazyFun now
2011-06-28T06:45:53  <ato> I'm going mad.
2011-06-28T06:45:58  <tomh-> well I guess there are some good reasons why it needs its own build system

2011-06-28T07:40:27  <nirvdrum> But the code was already tagged.

2011-06-28T07:44:57  *** selbot2 has quit IRC
2011-06-28T07:45:00  <ato> piece of code, that is.
2011-06-28T07:45:26  <rpk> nirvdrum: maybe we can add release notes in the future?
2011-06-28T07:45:59  <nirvdrum> rpk: I believe we use the blog post for that.
2011-06-28T07:46:31  <nirvdrum> I'm not against it, but I'm not really sure of everything that goes into a release myself.  There's usually a theme or a few major items.
2011-06-28T07:46:49  <rpk> I didn't see a mention that grid functionality was broken pretty severely
2011-06-28T07:47:04  <rpk> I'll go look again though
2011-06-28T07:47:15  <ato> Where is the ChromeDriver source located?
2011-06-28T07:47:31  <ato> In the Chromium repo?
2011-06-28T07:50:05  <nirvdrum> rpk: I doubt the release would have gone out if anyone knew the grid was broken.  That's not usually something you throw in release notes.

2011-06-28T07:55:18  <jarib> ato: something similar to execute_atom, yes. obvsiouly you probably have more direct access to opera than driver.execute_script
2011-06-28T07:55:54  <ato> Not when it comes to locating elements.
2011-06-28T07:55:54  <jarib> although since execute_script probably deals with serialization of elements etc already, that's probably a good start

2011-06-28T08:03:19  <jrock20041> So using rc3 and when using firefox with linktext it looks for the rendered text. I understand that. But when using htmlunit it looks at the code and not the rendered text. Is this suppose to be?

2011-06-28T11:27:12  <marlena> samitbadle: Dave helped me get things set up on my computer.  He suggested that I try writing some tests for alert pages so I'll work on writing one of those.

2011-06-28T11:44:49  <jarib> samitbadle: hmm, should be quite straightforward. keep in mind method name conventions, e.g. boolean methods end with a question mark (e.g. #multiple? over #is_multiple) and no "get" prefixes (e.g. #first_selected_option over #get_first_selected_option)
2011-06-28T11:46:24  <samitbadle> jarib: Sure. I will emulate the existing conventions. I hope to finish it tonight. I will send you the code with my sample selenese to ruby/webdriver code tomorrow.
2011-06-28T11:46:40  <jarib> awesome. looking forward to it
2011-06-28T11:47:08  <samitbadle> jarib: which module should it belong to?
2011-06-28T11:48:00  <jarib> good question
2011-06-28T11:49:04  <jarib> it'd be nice to keep things like this in a separate module
2011-06-28T11:49:20  <jarib> so I guess Selenium::WebDriver::Support::Select
2011-06-28T11:49:40  <jarib> our module nesting is a bit deep by ruby standards.
2011-06-28T11:50:23  <jarib> then again people can just include Selenium::WebDriver::Support in their tests/page objects
2011-06-28T11:50:33  <jarib> so let's do that
2011-06-28T11:50:54  <samitbadle> jarib: in Java it is in ...support/ui/select, but I guess Selenium::WebDriver::Support::Select  is fine.
2011-06-28T11:51:05  <jarib> yep
2011-06-28T11:51:13  <samitbadle> Excellent! Thanks.
2011-06-28T11:51:21  <samitbadle> See you tomorrow. bye

2011-06-28T12:09:29  <krichards> I'm seeing some flakey behaviour with webdriver where pages have supposedly finished loading but when I get errors which appear to indicate the page is still being loaded (e.g. title is blank or  elements don't exist), I've had to put Thread.sleep in place to make the tests reliable.  This problem only seemed to begin when I went from FF3 to FF4, but this might just that things got quicker and the problem is no obvious.  Any ide

2011-06-28T15:58:39  <selbot2_> david.burns@theautomatedtester.co.uk half a minute ago - DavidBurns removing a line that over time causes performance to degrade for issue 1854 - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12653
2011-06-28T16:02:16  <selbot> New news from builds: IDE-IDE-118 was SUCCESSFUL : Dependant of IDE-EDITOR-136 <http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/IDE-IDE-118> || IDE-EDITOR-136 was SUCCESSFUL : Updated by david.burns@theautomatedtester.co.uk <http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/IDE-EDITOR-136>
2011-06-28T16:02:45  <nirvdrum> AutomatedTester: That's one intriguing commit.
2011-06-28T16:03:14  <AutomatedTester> nirvdrum: I have sent a message to Simon for a review
2011-06-28T16:03:29  <AutomatedTester> I can't see why that would cause an issue :/
2011-06-28T16:03:31  <AutomatedTester> but it does
2011-06-28T16:03:48  <nirvdrum> Did you find any place where it was previously referenced?
2011-06-28T16:03:55  <AutomatedTester> no
2011-06-28T16:04:05  <nirvdrum> Or maybe it's a case of entropy if it needs to be random.
2011-06-28T16:04:17  <AutomatedTester> *shrug*
2011-06-28T16:04:17  <nirvdrum> Funky.  Just postulating.
2011-06-28T16:04:34  <AutomatedTester> i wish I knew, its very bizarre
2011-06-28T16:06:39  <AutomatedTester> i can add you to the review issue if you want to see what Simon says
2011-06-28T16:07:24  <nirvdrum> Yes, please.
2011-06-28T16:07:50  <nirvdrum> I wonder if that line disables firefox's spellchecker.
2011-06-28T16:08:49  * AutomatedTester will add it as a default for Se2 code and then run krosenvold's code to see if it affects it
2011-06-28T16:10:20  <AutomatedTester> hmm ok, so google code review wants my code in a separate branch :(
2011-06-28T16:10:39  <AutomatedTester> star  #1946 to keep track
2011-06-28T16:10:40  <selbot2_>  open/new Code review for changes made to fix issue 1854 - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1946
2011-06-28T16:11:10  <nirvdrum> Thanks.
2011-06-28T16:11:16  <nirvdrum> And thanks for tracking this down.
2011-06-28T16:11:37  <nirvdrum> Maybe the Internet can relax now.
2011-06-28T16:13:50  <nirvdrum> Dinner.  bbl

2011-06-28T23:08:59  <baijum> AutomatedTester: Hi, any progress on Python API patch ?
2011-06-28T23:09:11  <AutomatedTester> baijum: on what?
2011-06-28T23:10:25  <baijum> there was a patch I modified and submitted to create API site: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1651
2011-06-28T23:10:44  <baijum> out will be something like this: http://184.106.69.139:9999/
2011-06-28T23:11:18  <baijum> You mentioned that you upload it to packages.python.org/selenium
2011-06-28T23:11:28  <AutomatedTester> baijum: i am travelling at the moment so working on things my team need
2011-06-28T23:11:46  <AutomatedTester> later in the week I will be at home and look at it
2011-06-28T23:12:40  <baijum> AutomatedTester: that's fine :) sorry to bother you.
2011-06-28T23:12:52  <AutomatedTester> its cool, chase me for it on Friday
2011-06-28T23:13:22  <AutomatedTester> I spent today working through #1854
2011-06-28T23:13:23  <selbot2_>  open/started Selenium 2.0 RC2 gets constantly slower during test suite - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1854
2011-06-28T23:14:33  *** andialbrecht_ is now known as andialbrecht
2011-06-28T23:14:41  <baijum> wow. that's a challenging issue..
2011-06-28T23:15:35  <AutomatedTester> the fix doesnt make it look like its challenging
2011-06-28T23:15:51  <AutomatedTester> but i had to bisect ~1200 revisions
2011-06-28T23:17:06  <baijum> ah. ok, Did you used something like git-bisect with svn ?
2011-06-28T23:17:08  <baijum> http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-bisect.html
2011-06-28T23:17:30  <AutomatedTester> no
2011-06-28T23:17:33  *** Binken has joined #selenium
2011-06-28T23:18:01  <AutomatedTester> i did a binary search
2011-06-28T23:18:31  <AutomatedTester> since the commit it was in didnt look like it should cause the issue
2011-06-28T23:19:04  <AutomatedTester> and that change shouldnt cause a perf issue but does
2011-06-28T23:19:53  *** Mayank has quit IRC
2011-06-28T23:20:14  <baijum> if Selenium can constantly monitor performance something like http://speed.pypy.org/ these kind of issues can be spotted early
2011-06-28T23:21:40  <baijum> they developed a performance test suite which runs with every commit: http://speed.pypy.org/timeline/
