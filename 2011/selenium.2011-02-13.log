2011-02-13T12:16:22  <rb2k> when checking for class attributes (e.g. [@class='foo'] ), shouldn't selenium ignore multiple whitespaces between the classes?
2011-02-13T12:16:52  <rb2k> e.g. both class="foo       bar" and class="foo bar" should be treated as an element with 2 classes "foo" and "bar"?
2011-02-13T12:17:16  <rb2k> it seems as if the @class= xpath is sensitive to "more than one whitespace"

2011-02-13T19:03:25  <jleyba> Hello
2011-02-13T19:04:17  <simonstewart> We're closing in on release
2011-02-13T19:04:26  <simonstewart> All I need is a clean IE build
2011-02-13T19:04:34  <simonstewart> And a run of test_selenium using IE too....
2011-02-13T19:05:04  <jleyba> I'd help with the IE build, but I can't get it to link.
2011-02-13T19:05:23  <simonstewart> Sounds like you need the 32/64 bit cross compilers
