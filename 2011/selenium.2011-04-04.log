2011-04-04T09:35:54  <jimevans> so i'm looking over the problem we had with findElement(By.name())
2011-04-04T09:36:04  <jimevans> has the main page you were testing undergone a rewrite?
2011-04-04T09:36:12  <ahfeel> absolutely not
2011-04-04T09:36:24  <jimevans> as i recall, we were looking for an element with name='login'

2011-04-04T09:36:48  <ahfeel> we found and understood the problem with simonstewart
2011-04-04T09:36:54  <jimevans> can you resend me the url of the page under test?
2011-04-04T09:37:06  <simonstewart> ahfeel: well, I _think_ we got it

2011-04-04T10:11:09  <simonstewart> The test should pass
2011-04-04T10:11:44  <esteele> Chrome opens new tabs with each get() call. Is that intentional? Trying to decide whether or not to rewrite my tests to account for it.
2011-04-04T10:11:45  <antlong> jarib, thats pretty similar to how gwt works, you would just click on the dropdown then you can click on the elements in the list
2011-04-04T10:12:05  <antlong> not sure if its fruitful to be able to click on things that are hidden, since its not realistic interaction

2011-04-04T10:29:27  <lord1234> any idea why a button element would not be found on a page where it blatantly is?
2011-04-04T10:29:27  <RossPatterson> lord1234: Selenium IDE, RC, or Webdriver?
2011-04-04T10:29:27  <lord1234> sel RC
2011-04-04T10:29:27  <RossPatterson> XPath?
2011-04-04T10:29:27  <lord1234> .//button[@_title='keywords']
2011-04-04T10:29:28  <lord1234> (ignore the ., its for IRC)
2011-04-04T10:29:46  <lord1234> html: <button type="button" class="ui-multiselect ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all flr mr8" _title="keywords" aria-haspopup="true" style="width: 140px;">
2011-04-04T10:29:50  <RossPatterson> Sorry, I meant "Are you using an XPath?"  So the answer is Yes :-)
2011-04-04T10:29:58  <lord1234> the html for said Xpath
2011-04-04T10:30:03  <RossPatterson> Hmm ... just a sec
2011-04-04T10:30:21  <lord1234> wierd thing:  i have this exact same xpath throughout the app I am testing...this is the first time I have encountered this issue.

2011-04-04T10:31:48  <antlong> lord1234 add a sleep to check if its a timing issue
2011-04-04T10:31:52  <lord1234> its not
2011-04-04T10:32:01  <lord1234> i tried this with debugging on and a breakpoint at that line
2011-04-04T10:32:05  <lord1234> made sure the page was fully loaded
2011-04-04T10:32:07  <lord1234> and still same issue
2011-04-04T10:32:38  <RossPatterson> One quick thought: In the cases where it works, does the attribute name also start with "_"?
2011-04-04T10:32:52  <lord1234> yes it does
2011-04-04T10:33:04  <RossPatterson> OK, that's good.
2011-04-04T10:33:13  <lord1234> i mean its literally the same function called
2011-04-04T10:33:14  <lord1234> everytime
2011-04-04T10:33:18  <lord1234> with the exact same variable passed
2011-04-04T10:33:21  <RossPatterson> OK
2011-04-04T10:33:32  <RossPatterson> So, REALLY REALLY REALLY the same :-)
2011-04-04T10:33:35  <lord1234> yes
2011-04-04T10:33:51  <lord1234> contents of the button(its actually a dropdown that is a button, but whatever) vary, but that doesn't matter for this
2011-04-04T10:34:52  <RossPatterson> The content of the BUTTON element shouldn't matter in this case.  I assume you know for sure that there is no whitespace surrounding "keywords"?  Because "=" is "exactly equal to" in XPath.
2011-04-04T10:35:23  <lord1234> yes i do
2011-04-04T10:36:15  <antlong> lord1234 is that the same html from the page?
2011-04-04T10:36:16  <lord1234> as i said, i have this element repeatedly in the app
2011-04-04T10:36:16  <RossPatterson> Since you're talking about debuggers, I assume you're in Firefox.  Last question: can you find that element using XPather, Firebug, et al.?
2011-04-04T10:36:27  <lord1234> antlong: thats a direct cut and paste of the referenced HTML
2011-04-04T10:36:33  <lord1234> yes i can find it using firebug+firefinder
2011-04-04T10:36:34  <antlong> lord1234, i dont see where that tag is closed
2011-04-04T10:37:03  <lord1234> oh it is
2011-04-04T10:37:09  <lord1234> there is text inside the element
2011-04-04T10:37:10  <lord1234> and then its closed
2011-04-04T10:38:14  <antlong> ahh
2011-04-04T10:38:15  <lord1234> i didn't paste that part
2011-04-04T10:38:15  <lord1234> sorry
2011-04-04T10:38:15  <antlong> np
2011-04-04T10:38:15  <RossPatterson> Rats.  So it's there and it should be findable.
2011-04-04T10:38:24  <RossPatterson> This is Firefox, right?  3 or 4?
2011-04-04T10:39:45  <lord1234> 3.6
2011-04-04T10:39:52  <lord1234> <button type="button" class="ui-multiselect ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all flr mr8" _title="keywords" aria-haspopup="true" style="width: 140px;"> 174 of 174 </button>   is the full element html
2011-04-04T10:39:52  <RossPatterson> Rats.  I use that one all day every day :-)
2011-04-04T10:39:55  <lord1234> running 2.0b3(also tried with 1.0, still no workee)
2011-04-04T10:39:58  <RossPatterson> There's no obvious reason why that would fail.  In Firefox, Selenium RC uses the built-in XPath, which Firebug et al. should also.  Thus what one finds, the other should also.
2011-04-04T10:39:58  <antlong> lord1234 can you paste the link to the page
2011-04-04T10:39:59  <lord1234> login required unfortunately
2011-04-04T10:40:01  <lord1234> so unfortunately, no.

2011-04-04T10:40:06  <RossPatterson> antlong: It's the RC API
2011-04-04T10:40:06  <antlong> the _ is throwing it off?
2011-04-04T10:40:06  <lord1234> as i said, it works on similar dropdowns
2011-04-04T10:40:07  <antlong> hmn
2011-04-04T10:40:07  <lord1234> so dont think so
2011-04-04T10:40:08  <RossPatterson> He says there are identical cases that work.
2011-04-04T10:40:09  <antlong> i cant imagine a reason why it would work for one and not the other
2011-04-04T10:40:09  <antlong> timing only, but he said thats not an issue
2011-04-04T10:41:40  <lord1234> guarantee its not timing

2011-04-04T10:50:45  <antlong> RossPatterson, i think i would eat your hat leftovers if it did
2011-04-04T10:51:46  <lord1234> yep that works
2011-04-04T10:51:46  <lord1234> get eatin
2011-04-04T10:51:47  <lord1234> (just kidding one sec)
2011-04-04T10:51:47  <lord1234> no fail
2011-04-04T10:51:47  <RossPatterson> LOL
2011-04-04T10:51:47  <lord1234> :(
2011-04-04T10:51:47  <lord1234> hrm i might be able to get into the browserbot.js easier then u say ross....lets see
2011-04-04T10:51:47  <lord1234> but yes, all dropdowns in the app are named "_title='something'
2011-04-04T10:51:48  <lord1234> "
2011-04-04T10:51:48  <lord1234> and this is the first time i have been unable to click them
2011-04-04T10:51:48  <RossPatterson> With Firebug, you'll be able to set a breakpoint even though it's being loaded from the jar, because Firefox will be downloading it from Selenium RC's embedded webserver.  Thus it's just another downloaded JavaScript file.
2011-04-04T10:51:48  <lord1234> well here's a wierdness
2011-04-04T10:51:53  <lord1234> i've always wondered
2011-04-04T10:52:06  <lord1234> when i seleniumdriver.new browser, it doesn't have firebug in the profile that is loaded....
2011-04-04T10:52:15  <lord1234> why would that be?
2011-04-04T10:53:13  <RossPatterson> It's because when Selenium RC launches Firefox, it creates a brand-new profile each time.  You can control what profile it uses or you can supply a template for the profile, both using command-line switches on the JAR.
2011-04-04T10:53:42  <lord1234> where are the command line switches defined?
2011-04-04T10:56:02  <RossPatterson> "java -jar selenium-server.jar -help" will display them.
2011-04-04T10:56:06  <lord1234> okie

2011-04-04T11:02:01  <lord1234> wtf
2011-04-04T11:02:04  <lord1234> i gotta figure this out
2011-04-04T11:02:13  <lord1234> (the only difference was i enabled firebug and this profile....)
2011-04-04T11:02:39  <lord1234> but i've never used the profile before
2011-04-04T11:02:57  <RossPatterson> Oh, man, I hate it when stuff like that happens.

2011-04-04T11:36:07  <plightbo> when did the dreaded java.net.Inet6AddressImpl.getHostByAddr slowdown come back in to effect?
2011-04-04T11:36:14  <plightbo> i haven't seen that problem in like a year
2011-04-04T11:37:33  <krosenvold_> I see that the selenium server is causing client failures because the "sessionId" is not set on the serialized json object.
2011-04-04T11:37:57  <krosenvold_> Should the sessionId be set on the exception ?
2011-04-04T11:38:18  <krosenvold_> plightbo: Could that be NetworkUtil.getIPv4Address ?
2011-04-04T11:38:19  <krosenvold_> (Used by grid)

2011-04-04T11:46:03  <plightbo> well, it's annoying
2011-04-04T11:46:11  <plightbo> and it only happens when I'm at my house in Portland
2011-04-04T11:46:16  <plightbo> in san Diego it doesn't
2011-04-04T11:46:22  <krosenvold_> I think the selenium server constructs 2 instances of NetworkUtils but that should be a worst case ?
2011-04-04T11:46:22  <plightbo> wonder if it's related to my network setup
2011-04-04T11:47:04  <krosenvold_> Would you mind starting up with a breakpoint in networkUtils constructor to validate it's only being called once ?
2011-04-04T11:47:16  <krosenvold_> (Or twice for server)
2011-04-04T11:50:26  <krosenvold_> plightbo: Which os are you experiencing this on ?

2011-04-04T12:16:56  <ner0x> Ugh.
2011-04-04T12:18:32  <RossPatterson> ner0x: Depends on what you mean by "goofy".  In our experience, poorly-written tests are the biggest one.
2011-04-04T12:19:13  <ner0x> RossPatterson: Which is possibly the case. I'm semi-new. Let me get a paste for you.
2011-04-04T12:22:05  <ner0x> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/95970 http://paste.scsys.co.uk/95971
2011-04-04T12:23:39  <ner0x> Works fine "by hand" won't work when trying to use selenium.

2011-04-04T12:31:02  <ner0x> And it's not the function, because it works in others. For some reason it's not getting the ajax sent back, I believe.
2011-04-04T12:32:41  <antlong> RossPatterson //span[\@id='error-login-email']
2011-04-04T12:32:41  <antlong> is that \ valid?
2011-04-04T12:32:42  <ner0x> Yes, because it's perl, it's escaping the @
2011-04-04T12:32:42  <RossPatterson> What language is this?
2011-04-04T12:32:42  <ner0x> perl
2011-04-04T12:32:42  <RossPatterson> Ah, that was my guess.
2011-04-04T12:32:42  <RossPatterson> Right.  Perl has it's own ideas.  About everything :-)
2011-04-04T12:32:43  <ner0x> :-)
2011-04-04T12:32:44  <RossPatterson> wait_for_text_is("//span[\@id='error-login-email']/label", "Email address not found."); <-- You're waiting for <SPAN id='error-login-email'><LABEL>Email address not found</LABEL>  ?
2011-04-04T12:32:44  <antlong> ner0x, where is wait_for_text_is defined
2011-04-04T12:32:44  <ner0x> RossPatterson: Yes.
2011-04-04T12:32:44  <ner0x> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/95975
2011-04-04T12:32:44  <RossPatterson> Nothing obviously wrong with that.  Although it's an odd way to use <LABEL>.
2011-04-04T12:32:44  <ner0x> RossPatterson: That label is generated via jquery.validate.js
2011-04-04T12:32:45  <RossPatterson> Ooh ... jQuery AJAXy-ness ... next most likely answer after "bad test"
2011-04-04T12:32:45  <ner0x> RossPatterson: Works for some, not for others.
2011-04-04T12:32:45  <RossPatterson> There's a good chance you have a timing-related failure, due to the element containing the LABEL not actually existing at the time you start the wait.
2011-04-04T12:32:53  <ner0x> wait_for_text_is, checks every second, for 30 seconds.
2011-04-04T12:33:04  <RossPatterson> We use a custom waiter we call WaitForElementPresent(...locator..., ...timeout...)
2011-04-04T12:33:13  <ner0x> Done. :)
2011-04-04T12:33:27  <RossPatterson> Yes, but does it tolerate the exception that will be generated if the element is missing?
