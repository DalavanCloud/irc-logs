2011-04-01T02:07:57  <gtailleb> hi AutomatedTester
2011-04-01T02:08:09  <AutomatedTester> hi gtailleb
2011-04-01T02:08:29  <ahfeel> hi guys :)
2011-04-01T02:08:41  <gtailleb> about that bug with IE8 and findElement(By.name) that doesn't work (hi ahfeel)
2011-04-01T02:08:54  <AutomatedTester> yea
2011-04-01T02:09:28  <gtailleb> we've been able to get the most minimalist test case possible, and find what's causing the bug
2011-04-01T02:09:37  <AutomatedTester> oh wow
2011-04-01T02:09:56  <gtailleb> We've got some javascript on our site :
2011-04-01T02:12:10  <gtailleb> with code like function Foo() {}; Foo.prototype.Bar = function(parent) {}; => no problem
2011-04-01T02:12:10  <gtailleb> with code like Object.prototype.Inherits = function(parent) {}; =>javascaript error "Unsupported locator strategy : Inherits" => leads to a NoSuchElementException
2011-04-01T02:12:10  <gtailleb> with code like Object.prototype.Toto = function(parent) {}; =>javascaript error "Unsupported locator strategy : Toto" => leads to a NoSuchElementException
2011-04-01T02:13:11  <ahfeel> so extending Object.prototype makes the thing fail
2011-04-01T02:13:14  <ahfeel> :/
2011-04-01T02:13:19  <gtailleb> seems
2011-04-01T02:17:22  <gtailleb> Any thoughts on this AutomatedTester?

2011-04-01T02:33:08  <ceecee1> AutomatedTester: i've got this failure when running on Mac Safari5 - Window does not exist. If this looks like a Selenium bug, make sure to read http://selenium-core.openqa.org/reference.html#openWindow for potential workarounds.
2011-04-01T02:40:10  <AutomatedTester> gtailleb: unfortunately I have only had a fleeting look at the Atoms code so not sure
2011-04-01T02:40:43  <AutomatedTester> ceecee1: does the browser load?
2011-04-01T02:40:49  <ceecee1> yep
2011-04-01T02:40:56  <AutomatedTester> and then open fails?
2011-04-01T02:41:32  <ceecee1> infact several commands do pass but on a random event the test fails
2011-04-01T02:42:22  <ceecee1> is there any special options to choose on the safari default settings
2011-04-01T02:42:59  <ceecee1> i actually gave up running tests on safari until i found this channel to put out the question
2011-04-01T02:45:13  <AutomatedTester> ceecee1: sorry my safari knowledge is extremely limited
2011-04-01T02:46:57  <ceecee1> hmm have u run on safari successfully?

2011-04-01T08:11:48  <antlong> np
2011-04-01T08:11:54  <antlong> operator module is key
2011-04-01T08:12:12  <antlong> lets you pass in operators to functions
2011-04-01T08:12:25  <antlong> rather methods
2011-04-01T08:12:42  <AutomatedTester> operator module?
2011-04-01T08:12:58  <antlong> http://d.pr/PXsp
2011-04-01T08:13:00  <antlong> oops, sorry
2011-04-01T08:13:05  <antlong> http://docs.python.org/library/operator.html
2011-04-01T08:13:43  <AutomatedTester> sorry I wasnt sure what you mean there :D
2011-04-01T08:13:48  <antlong> heh
2011-04-01T08:14:21  <antlong> ie:
2011-04-01T08:14:54  <antlong> operator.eq(1, int("1"))
2011-04-01T08:15:50  <AutomatedTester> what I was after was a DSL over native asserts
2011-04-01T08:15:53  <antlong> i dont really mess with the assert* methods, so i just use assert and the operator module
2011-04-01T08:17:07  <AutomatedTester> i was asking because I have extended py.test for Mozilla
2011-04-01T08:17:21  <AutomatedTester> but means all tests using unittest asserts wont work
2011-04-01T08:17:30  <AutomatedTester> because we cant inherit from it
2011-04-01T08:17:41  <antlong> why not?
2011-04-01T08:17:59  <antlong> they should be compatible with ut now mostly
2011-04-01T08:18:09  <AutomatedTester> its compatible as a runner
2011-04-01T08:18:19  <AutomatedTester> but I extended the py.test runner
2011-04-01T08:18:30  *** mister_m has joined #selenium
2011-04-01T08:18:32  <AutomatedTester> so made it incompatible
2011-04-01T08:18:53  <AutomatedTester> the runner only does the discovery really
2011-04-01T08:19:02  <antlong> actually
2011-04-01T08:19:10  <AutomatedTester> the vanilla runner that is
2011-04-01T08:19:17  <antlong> you can just copy paste the assert methods from unittest.TestCase to another file, and import that
2011-04-01T08:19:38  <mister_m> I am not able to get safari to open to run tests in with the stand alone server 2.0b3
2011-04-01T08:19:43  <AutomatedTester> antlong: I kinda did that
2011-04-01T08:19:46  <mister_m> I am using *safariproxy
2011-04-01T08:19:52  <AutomatedTester> but built it from scractch
2011-04-01T08:20:11  <AutomatedTester> static class with methods that do the asserts
2011-04-01T08:20:24  <AutomatedTester> so its now Assert.equal
2011-04-01T08:20:29  <AutomatedTester> Assert.none
2011-04-01T08:20:31  <AutomatedTester> and so on

2011-04-01T09:04:23  <jimevans> short answer: Windows
2011-04-01T09:04:47  <jimevans> long answer: the rake task uses 'sh' to spawn some of the processes during the build.
2011-04-01T09:04:52  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: come over to the dark side
2011-04-01T09:04:56  <jimevans> however, some of these processes don't terminate.
2011-04-01T09:05:08  <jimevans> so 'sh' never returns...
2011-04-01T09:05:20  <simonstewart> Ugh

2011-04-01T09:05:50  <simonstewart> Looks like a good topic for us to hack on at the conf
2011-04-01T09:05:59  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: would love to. the company is too invested in .NET development... :)
2011-04-01T09:06:13  <jimevans> simonstewart: sounds like.
2011-04-01T09:06:16  <simonstewart> mono? :)
2011-04-01T09:06:19  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: there is this new technology called mono
2011-04-01T09:06:23  <AutomatedTester> its amazing
2011-04-01T09:06:32  <AutomatedTester> can do ASP.NET MVC and all sorts

2011-04-01T09:06:54  <simonstewart> I broke things
2011-04-01T09:07:09  <jimevans> our company has two big product lines, one of which is a Windows Forms app...
2011-04-01T09:07:18  <davehunt> I leave my house at 18:30 tonight. Not load of time :/
2011-04-01T09:07:25  <jimevans> mono not as good at WinForms.
2011-04-01T09:07:31  <simonstewart> davehunt: That's different
2011-04-01T09:07:37  <AutomatedTester> davehunt: oh my god
2011-04-01T09:07:52  <simonstewart> I have to ask why you're on IRC and not packing....
2011-04-01T09:07:56  <davehunt> I'm staying at a friends tonight, closer to the airport
2011-04-01T09:08:13  <davehunt> I'm almost done packing
2011-04-01T09:08:23  <simonstewart> Oh. So if you leave late you're not going to miss a flight
2011-04-01T09:08:28  <jimevans> right then. off to lunch and to pick up remote equipment. back in an hour or so.

2011-04-01T09:09:27  <dereke> we want to automate android from ruby
2011-04-01T09:09:42  <dereke> and am going to take a look at embedeeing the webdriver server into robotium
2011-04-01T09:09:59  <dereke> no idea if it can be done.. but I can't see why not
2011-04-01T09:10:43  <AutomatedTester> dereke: the android APK essentially creates a webdriver server on the phone
2011-04-01T09:11:32  <dereke> yup, so should just need to map requests to robotium and add in some new commands - in theory?
2011-04-01T09:11:44  <AutomatedTester> in theory
2011-04-01T09:12:07  <dereke> well hopefully I will get a chance to try it out - my java skills are pretty average though!

2011-04-01T09:24:47  <simonstewart> I have my work shop code ready, but it assumes I can reach Reader Play
2011-04-01T09:24:58  <adamgroucher> no idea, i expect it is 'supposed' to be good -- but will suck under the weight of geeks
2011-04-01T09:25:08  <simonstewart> Hmph.

2011-04-01T09:31:03  <adamgroucher> $99 per night vs $162 per night is significant when you dont have an expense account to work with
2011-04-01T09:31:12  <simonstewart> Fair enough
2011-04-01T09:31:34  <simonstewart> Might be worth giving them a call and seeing what their availabliity is
2011-04-01T09:31:53  <andytinkham> adamgroucher: I think I got a $99 a night at the Hotel Beresford (or something like that) which is supposed to be right across the street from the venue

2011-04-01T11:22:54  <simonstewart> The error comes as IE polls the page to figure out if the page has loaded. The problem is that as it does "something" causes the JS to fail. The error indicates that the JS sandbox has denied the JS access to a variable

2011-04-01T11:29:28  <True_Blue> When using Page Objects, do you create methods for getting element's text, and other things that you can do to an element?  I know you create click methods so that they return a Page Object.  Do you also create a method like getHeaderText() so that you can call page.getHeaderText(), or in the tests do you call page.getHeader().getText?

2011-04-01T11:30:57  <simonstewart> True_Blue: I create methods that model the services offered by the page
2011-04-01T11:31:14  <simonstewart> With components nested inside
2011-04-01T11:31:26  <simonstewart> So, in your example, I might have "page.getHeader()"
2011-04-01T11:32:58  *** mi9ster_m has quit IRC
2011-04-01T11:33:04  <RossPatterson> True_Blue: We tend to have exposed page fields that are properties, since that's natural in C#.  Thus: AssertAreEqual("My Neato Keen Page", page.HeaderText).  For input fields, we provide setters as well as getters.
2011-04-01T11:33:26  <True_Blue> That's sort of what I am doing, but it seems like a lot of overhead
2011-04-01T11:33:42  <True_Blue> To go through the page and create getters for each thing, and then also methods for each action
2011-04-01T11:33:56  <True_Blue> so if I get .getHeader, I then create .getHeaderText
2011-04-01T11:34:02  <RossPatterson> But we also do as simonstewart suggests, so e.g. LoginPage.cs has read/write properties called Email, Password, and RememberMe, but it also has method called Login(string email, string password, bool rememberMe).
2011-04-01T11:34:04  <True_Blue> And this has to happen for each text element
2011-04-01T11:35:13  <True_Blue> A text field seems to be even more complicated.  I would have .getDropdownValue(), clearDropdown(), sendKeysDropdown(String str), etc
2011-04-01T11:35:50  <True_Blue> the more you can do to a field, the more methods you would have in your page object for each field
2011-04-01T11:36:13  <True_Blue> So in your tests, do you not write anything using .getText(), .getValue(), click(), clear(), etc?
2011-04-01T11:36:20  <True_Blue> Instead those are all done in your page object?
2011-04-01T11:36:27  <simonstewart> yes. In the page object
2011-04-01T11:36:32  <adamgroucher> there are lots of variations for page objects. for instance, i override get/set to get/set things in the browser. but then have like click_on_foo()
2011-04-01T11:36:36  <simonstewart> The tests don't get to see the raw webdriver api
2011-04-01T11:36:52  <True_Blue> right
2011-04-01T11:37:00  <True_Blue> I thought that seemed to be the best way
2011-04-01T11:37:16  <True_Blue> But then I got overwhelmed by having to create a method for each interaction of each element
2011-04-01T11:38:26  <RossPatterson> We have our own set of element classes that make some of this happen semi-automatically.  Hence the email field looks like;
2011-04-01T11:38:28  <RossPatterson> public string email
2011-04-01T11:38:28  <RossPatterson> {
2011-04-01T11:38:28  <RossPatterson> get { return emailElement.Text; }
2011-04-01T11:38:28  <RossPatterson> set { emailElement.Text = value; }
2011-04-01T11:38:28  <RossPatterson> }
2011-04-01T11:38:28  <RossPatterson> private readonly TextElement firstNameElement = new TextElement("", "input[@name='firstName']", "input[name='firstName']");
2011-04-01T11:38:57  <True_Blue> If I have two text fields, called name and address, I would have: .getName(), .getNametext(), .sendKeysToName(), .clearName(), etc etc
2011-04-01T11:39:04  <True_Blue> And then i'd have to do the same for address..
2011-04-01T11:39:30  <RossPatterson> And logging in looks like:
2011-04-01T11:39:36  <RossPatterson> LoginPage loginPage = landingPage.GoToLogin();
2011-04-01T11:39:37  <RossPatterson> PortalUser user = client.ChooseRandomPortalUser();
2011-04-01T11:39:37  <RossPatterson> MySupportPage supportPage = loginPage.Login(user);
2011-04-01T11:40:00  <True_Blue> Yeah I have forms where I can create a method to bundle things together
2011-04-01T11:40:14  <True_Blue> But if a tester wants to interact with things seperately on the page
2011-04-01T11:40:23  <True_Blue> there needs to be a method for each interaction for each element
2011-04-01T11:40:32  <True_Blue> Its not hard to do, but seems like a lot
2011-04-01T11:40:48  <adamgroucher> https://github.com/adamgoucher/python-selenium-pageobjects is how i do my stuff
2011-04-01T11:40:58  <RossPatterson> Of course, Simon would probably prefer: MySupportPage supportPage = GetPortalLandingPage().GoToLogin().Login(client.ChooseRandomPortalUser());
2011-04-01T11:40:59  <adamgroucher> (there are php and rspec versions as well)
2011-04-01T11:41:01  *** nitin_ has joined #selenium
2011-04-01T11:41:21  <True_Blue> Looking now at the link
2011-04-01T11:41:23  <RossPatterson> But some of our folks wrote APL for their day jobs long ago, and we remember trying to support that stuff :-)
2011-04-01T11:41:41  <True_Blue> I dont mind writing the interaction methods in the Page Objects
2011-04-01T11:41:45  <True_Blue> But when new products come out
2011-04-01T11:42:02  <True_Blue> the person who is writing the Page Object will have a lot of things to write
2011-04-01T11:42:09  <True_Blue> in order to fullfill all the interactions
2011-04-01T11:42:24  <simonstewart> Then don't model each product separately
2011-04-01T11:42:30  <simonstewart> Have a "Product" component
2011-04-01T11:42:31  <antlong> adamgroucher looks like youre mixing java and python there
2011-04-01T11:42:36  <simonstewart> THat you can ask the page for
2011-04-01T11:42:56  <simonstewart> Product p = ProductList.Get("product name")
2011-04-01T11:42:59  *** jimevans has joined #selenium
2011-04-01T11:43:00  <RossPatterson> A well-constructed set of Page Objects is highly isolated, and tends to be much easier to maintain over time than Selenese-style tests.
2011-04-01T11:43:13  <adamgroucher> antlong: if you knew either language i would likely be offended at that :P :D
2011-04-01T11:43:51  <jimevans> heh. logged back on to see adamgroucher in the house. always a pleasure when you're in that kind of mood, adam. :)
2011-04-01T11:43:53  <simonstewart> adamgroucher: play nice....

2011-04-01T11:44:18  <adamgroucher> the :P :D implied i was playing nice -- or was intended to
2011-04-01T11:44:18  <antlong> adamgroucher mightve been offended hadnt you done this http://d.pr/5Xqm
2011-04-01T11:44:25  <RossPatterson> jimevans: Finally listened to HanselMinutes today.  You did a nice job.
2011-04-01T11:44:30  <simonstewart> lol
2011-04-01T11:44:39  <True_Blue> RossPatterson: true.  I had thought of having devs after they create a new product, to create the Page Objects for the WebDriver tests, and then the QA could come in and write the tests using those PageObjects
2011-04-01T11:44:50  <True_Blue> But I'm not sure the dev will think of every interaction on the page
2011-04-01T11:44:51  <adamgroucher> heh. did i copy-paste-fail
2011-04-01T11:44:54  <True_Blue> when building out the PageObject
2011-04-01T11:44:56  <antlong> ;)
2011-04-01T11:45:07  <True_Blue> And if they dont, it would require the QA to then edit the PageObject and add whats missing
2011-04-01T11:45:12  <True_Blue> Meaning, more skilled QA
2011-04-01T11:45:21  <jimevans> RossPatterson: thanks! i'm still hopeful we'll get some IE experts volunteering from it.
2011-04-01T11:45:27  <adamgroucher> (it would be mixing php and python anways :P)
2011-04-01T11:45:29  <antlong> adamgroucher in addition to   landing_Page = LandingPage()

2011-04-01T11:45:51  <simonstewart> Time for lunch.
2011-04-01T11:45:54  <simonstewart> TTFN
2011-04-01T11:45:56  <RossPatterson> True_Blue: Agreed on all points.  Generally, we find Page Objects are hard to create but easy to use and maintain, while Selenese is easy to create and use but hard to maintain.
2011-04-01T11:46:17  <True_Blue> I agree.  I definitely see the positives of it, but it ruins some of my preconceived notions I had
2011-04-01T11:46:17  <RossPatterson> Simon must be in CA today :-)
2011-04-01T11:46:17  <True_Blue> :)
2011-04-01T11:46:34  <True_Blue> We have a lot of QA here, but only a couple who can code
2011-04-01T11:46:46  <True_Blue> That means we wouldnt be able to expect all QA to write tests
2011-04-01T11:46:54  <True_Blue> As sometimes they will need to add to the Page Object
2011-04-01T11:47:05  <True_Blue> It cant be reasonably assumed that the Page Object is fully fleshed out
2011-04-01T11:47:28  <jimevans> True_Blue: we used to be in that boat here at work (many QA who can't code). attrition has changed that situation.
2011-04-01T11:47:59  <RossPatterson> True_Blue: There's another option.  Selenium2 has a PageFactory class that tries to matomagically learn what the Page Object for a page should be, based on a lot less setup than a hand-created Page Object.  I tend to value manually-created code highly, but some folks seem to like PageFactory.

2011-04-01T11:49:06  <jimevans> (now that i'm back online)
2011-04-01T11:49:43  <True_Blue> The people on high here want every QA to be a QA Engineer, and i dont foresee it happening.  My hope was to make it relatively easy for QA's to create tests, but maybe not be able to do some of the backend things like Page Objects etc
2011-04-01T11:49:48  <True_Blue> But I dont see that as possible now
2011-04-01T11:49:58  <True_Blue> Since there will be times when Page Objects and such need to be edited
2011-04-01T11:50:00  <True_Blue> and added to
2011-04-01T11:50:27  <RossPatterson> True_Blue: Our experience has been sort of in-between.  We have some QA testers who code automated tests, but they focus on the test script.  If they need a new facility, they ping the test framework team.  That would be moi :-)

2011-04-01T11:56:55  <jarib> jimevans: pong
2011-04-01T11:57:49  <jimevans> jarib: so i'm looking at the android driver and having some rake challenges on windows.
2011-04-01T11:57:56  <jarib> ok
2011-04-01T12:00:07  <True_Blue> I think that may be where we are going Ross
2011-04-01T12:00:28  <True_Blue> I have tried explaining to them that you cant have full on QA Engineers for all of them
2011-04-01T12:00:36  <jimevans> jarib: in the crazy-fun mappings (android.rb), we try to start the emulator by using a series of commands via "sh".
2011-04-01T12:00:42  <True_Blue> They have different skill sets with different knowledge
2011-04-01T12:01:05  <jimevans> some of the commands, however, don't exit.
2011-04-01T12:01:15  <andytinkham> RossPatterson: That's very similar to what we have here as well (though the test scripts will be Cucumber scenarios in general, with very little code written by anyone currently employed here who isn't me)
2011-04-01T12:01:15  <jimevans> meaning that on windows, rake hangs.
2011-04-01T12:01:20  <True_Blue> I just wanted to make sure I was on the right path, as to the methods
2011-04-01T12:01:38  <True_Blue> Its just a lot of methods being created per Page Object
2011-04-01T12:01:47  <jarib> jimevans: they don't exit on windows or they don't exit in general?
2011-04-01T12:02:22  <jimevans> i don't know about other platforms, but for example "adb start-server" loads adb.exe, and doesn't exit.
2011-04-01T12:02:26  <True_Blue> andytinkham: Do you use Page Objects?
2011-04-01T12:02:28  <jarib> ugh. are you editing this file? mind if i clean up tabs-vs-spaces?
2011-04-01T12:02:42  <jimevans> i'm not editing the file. i've got no stake in it at all.
2011-04-01T12:03:20  <andytinkham> True_Blue: Yeah, though a slight variant at the moment (I don't expose properties/methods for the individual controls - everything is method based with only the Page Objects being aware of what controls are on a given page)
2011-04-01T12:03:34  <jimevans> i just started thinking about doing a .NET binding to Android, and had a hard time getting things working even for Java.
2011-04-01T12:03:47  *** esteele|away is now known as esteele
2011-04-01T12:04:17  <True_Blue> andytinkham: can you give show me an example at all?
2011-04-01T12:05:08  <jarib> jimevans: ok. not sure why start-server wouldn't hang on non-windows. rake's sh() should be pretty solid on windows
2011-04-01T12:05:17  <True_Blue> Before I sink more work into mine, I've been searching around and seeing different examples
2011-04-01T12:05:17  <jarib> so i don't think rake's the problem
2011-04-01T12:05:31  <jarib> however, some of the commands seem to assume *nix
2011-04-01T12:05:47  <andytinkham> Nothing's online yet, and my company lawyer was pretty unhappy with the idea of me putting source code up there. I did get permission to show one (basic) page object in my SeConf talk next week though, and could probably email it. It's in Ruby in my case.
2011-04-01T12:06:00  <jimevans> jarib: i was under the impression that sh() would wait for the command to exit, returning the exit code.
2011-04-01T12:06:06  <True_Blue> ahh its not that big of a deal, don't want anyone to get in trouble
2011-04-01T12:06:08  <jarib> that's correct
2011-04-01T12:06:10  <True_Blue> Just as I said, curious
2011-04-01T12:06:53  <selbot2_> jari.bakken half a minute ago - JariBakken: Clean up tabs vs spaces in crazy_fun/mappings/android.rb. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11858
2011-04-01T12:06:56  <jimevans> jarib: so if the process never exits, how can it return the exit code?
2011-04-01T12:07:02  <andytinkham> I'd actually like to share more code to get feedback on how I'm structuring things. It's the permanent archive part I think that he objects to. Alternatively, if you're at SeConf, I will gladly talk through any code on my laptop. :)
2011-04-01T12:07:05  <jimevans> s/it/sh()
2011-04-01T12:07:41  <True_Blue> Right now, as I mentioned, I am creating methods for each interaction.  So each link has methods for click, each text field has methods for clear, sendKeys, getValue, each dropdown has methods for getSelectedOption, setOption, getAllValues, etc
2011-04-01T12:07:52  <True_Blue> So again, it seems like a lot of overhead and I didnt know if people did it other ways
2011-04-01T12:08:45  <andytinkham> In my case, I have what I refer to as Control Objects (which wrap a single control), so I have an EditBox class and a ComboBox class, etc. The Page Objects then instantiate these classes as appropriate for the controls on the page.
2011-04-01T12:08:47  <antlong> eh? why not use the @type
2011-04-01T12:09:13  <andytinkham> However, the clicks and that sort of thing are handled by the control objects and never made available to anything except the page objects
2011-04-01T12:09:21  <jarib> jimevans: not following. does the call to start-server return or hang?
2011-04-01T12:09:48  <jarib> if the process doesn't exit, rake won't either
2011-04-01T12:09:50  <jarib> right?
2011-04-01T12:09:51  <True_Blue> andytinkham: so you create say a Link class, TextField class, Dropdown class, etc?
2011-04-01T12:09:59  <jarib> let me try this on my machine
2011-04-01T12:10:11  <adamgroucher> andytinkham: could 'make up' an example one that illustrates the ideas you use and put it online?
2011-04-01T12:10:29  <True_Blue> How do your tests call those methods then from your page object then?
2011-04-01T12:10:33  <True_Blue> I'm very curious about it
2011-04-01T12:11:07  <jimevans> jarib: the sh() call in line 176 never returns. you never hit the next puts() statement.
2011-04-01T12:11:14  <jarib> i see
2011-04-01T12:11:18  <andytinkham> True_Blue: Yes, that's exactly right
2011-04-01T12:11:27  <True_Blue> right now I do: page.getCityDropownSelectedOption(), or page.setCityDropdownOption("Austin")

2011-04-01T12:13:27  <adamgroucher> True_Blue: thats a lot of typing. i'd do page.city = "Austin" -- which further hides the implementation (which is a good thing)
2011-04-01T12:13:49  <andytinkham> My tests are written as Cucumber scenarios. There's a very thin layer of code that matches the Cucumber clauses to functions in my "Concpetual" layer
2011-04-01T12:14:03  <True_Blue> hmm
2011-04-01T12:14:17  <andytinkham> The Conceptual layer consists of functions that correspond to user actions - completely ignorant of implementation
2011-04-01T12:14:49  <andytinkham> Those functions call into my Implementation-focused layer, which is where my page objects and control objects live
2011-04-01T12:16:08  <True_Blue> adamgroucher: What code do you have in your Page Object to allow you to do page.city?
2011-04-01T12:16:10  <andytinkham> My page objects define all their controls in their initialization code, and then provide methods that correspond to the actions or services on the page. Inside those action methods, the value= and click methods from the control objects are called
2011-04-01T12:17:33  <jarib> jimevans: start-server takes a few seconds to launch here, then exits. (the next stuff fails since my SDK isn't set up correctly)
2011-04-01T12:17:48  <andytinkham> Just a second, I'll gist a little code that I'm showing anyhow
2011-04-01T12:18:04  <True_Blue> cool
2011-04-01T12:18:05  <jimevans> jarib: huh. windows xp?
2011-04-01T12:18:05  <jarib> jimevans: so that could be a windows problem with the android sdk - they don't daemonize the server like they do on *nix
2011-04-01T12:18:11  <jarib> no no, OS X
2011-04-01T12:18:19  <jimevans> ah.

2011-04-01T12:22:34  <andytinkham> OK, here's the gist: https://gist.github.com/f0929c008c041fdaf696  (there are 4 classes normally found in 4 files there)
2011-04-01T12:23:25  <jarib> i'm on r9, but guessing that's not the issue. would be a strange thing to change (whether or not the server is daemonized)

2011-04-01T12:25:41  <RossPatterson> Your Control and CheckBox look like our PageElements/Element and PageElements/CheckBox.  Glad to see it's not original :-)
2011-04-01T12:25:47  <RossPatterson> (on our part, I mean)
2011-04-01T12:25:59  <True_Blue> Do your clicks return page objects?
2011-04-01T12:26:03  <RossPatterson> Even if it was discovered independently :-)
2011-04-01T12:26:15  <andytinkham> RossPatterson: And it's good to discover I'm not off in some crazy space too :)
2011-04-01T12:26:16  <RossPatterson> Yes, ours do.
2011-04-01T12:27:18  <andytinkham> Mine don't. The page object methods are where page objects are returned.  Click just returns whatever the selenium elements click method returns (by virtue of how ruby handles return values with none explicitly specified)
2011-04-01T12:27:59  <True_Blue> hmm
2011-04-01T12:28:14  <jarib> andytinkham: why does Page include Singleton?
2011-04-01T12:28:36  <True_Blue> Right now, I may call clickMountainDewLink(), and then it returns the MountainDewPage
2011-04-01T12:28:53  <andytinkham> jarib: I've waffled back and forth on that. None of the page objects use a lot of memory, so I probably should just take it out and instantiate them. (Actually, I thought I had).
2011-04-01T12:30:25  <andytinkham> True_Blue: In my case, I'd approach the clickMountainDewLink() method as purchase_soda() or something like that on the page, passing in that I wanted Mountain Dew. The page object would then know that to achieve that user goal, it shoudl click on the mountain dew link
2011-04-01T12:30:48  * jarib agrees
2011-04-01T12:31:23  <andytinkham> jarib: agrees with removing Singleton?
2011-04-01T12:31:26  <True_Blue> so like page.click("Mountain Dew")?
2011-04-01T12:31:26  <jarib> even just openMountainDewPage() or selectMountainDew() would be better
2011-04-01T12:31:30  <jarib> well, that as well

2011-04-01T12:31:40  *** wsmoak has joined #selenium
2011-04-01T12:31:43  <True_Blue> hmm
2011-04-01T12:32:02  <jarib> True_Blue: i try to keep anything that has to do with the DOM (e.g. clicking) out of my tests
2011-04-01T12:32:07  <andytinkham> True_Blue: In my world, nothing outside of the guts of the Page Object should know whether you're clicking a link or selecting Mountain Dew from a combo box
2011-04-01T12:32:08  <jarib> and hide it in the page objects
2011-04-01T12:32:09  <True_Blue> ahh I see
2011-04-01T12:32:28  <True_Blue> I see what you are saying now
2011-04-01T12:32:28  <andytinkham> THat way, when the developers change the pages, I only have to change the page object and not the whole test stack
2011-04-01T12:33:16  <jarib> my mindset is sort of that i should be able use the same tests if our app was rewritten as a desktop app by just swapping out the page object layer
2011-04-01T12:33:31  <jarib> that's not realistic of course, but makes the separation clear
2011-04-01T12:34:13  <jarib> i.e. page objects describe "domain actions", not the UI
2011-04-01T12:34:20  <andytinkham> Yep, that's very much in keeping with my mindset as well. It's far less likely that the business-focused side of things will change (and if it does, it will require a big development effort with time for a big test automation effort probably) than the technical implementation of those business goals
2011-04-01T12:34:27  <True_Blue> So you would have page.goToMountainDew() instead of page.click("Mountain Dew")
2011-04-01T12:34:49  <True_Blue> That goes back to creating a "click" method for each link though
2011-04-01T12:35:04  <True_Blue> if I have three links on my page, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Coke
2011-04-01T12:35:05  <andytinkham> True_Blue: Possibly, but I might even abstract it back further. Why would a user be going to Mountain Dew in your app?
2011-04-01T12:35:25  <True_Blue> They want to see the Mountain Dew promotion video
2011-04-01T12:35:28  <True_Blue> we'll say
2011-04-01T12:35:33  <jarib> selectSoda(Sodas.MOUNTAIN_DEW) ;)
2011-04-01T12:35:56  *** RossPatterson has quit IRC
2011-04-01T12:35:57  <andytinkham> So, my page object would probably have a method view_promotional_video() and I'd pass in Mountain Dew, Pepsi, or Coke as an argument to that
2011-04-01T12:36:26  <jimevans> andytinkham: you beat me to it.
2011-04-01T12:36:51  <jarib> yep
2011-04-01T12:38:12  <andytinkham> Then, whatever steps it would take to view and verify that video ON THAT PAGE would be in that method. There would also be a method in my Conceptual Layer which would handle the cross-page interaction
2011-04-01T12:38:15  <True_Blue> if you did view_promotional_video("Mountain Dew"), would you then have an if statement inside so you know which page object to return?
2011-04-01T12:38:52  <andytinkham> Possibly. Or I'd maybe use some meta-programming to convert automatically (I'd probably start with the if statement or select statement though)
2011-04-01T12:40:06  <True_Blue> So if you have three links on a page about soda, named "Mountain Dew", "Pepsi", and "Coke", the tester would call page.view_promotional_video("Mountain Dew"), and then inside view_promotional_video the if statement would see if its equal to Mountain Dew, and then return the MountainDewPageObject
2011-04-01T12:40:08  <andytinkham> and as a Ruby nit, I'd probably either use JariB's Sodas.MOUNTAIN_DEW or just :mountain_dew rather than a full string
2011-04-01T12:40:17  <True_Blue> I'm using Java
2011-04-01T12:40:27  <andytinkham> OK, no symbols for you then :)
2011-04-01T12:40:32  <True_Blue> haha
2011-04-01T12:40:59  <jarib> True_Blue: the point being that the string passed in doesn't have to match the actual link text
2011-04-01T12:41:16  <jimevans> True_Blue: enums!
2011-04-01T12:41:17  <andytinkham> view_promotional_video would find the link, click it, and then return the MountainDew Page object (assuming that you had a completely separate page for each soda).
2011-04-01T12:41:19  <jarib> s/the string/whatever
2011-04-01T12:41:56  <andytinkham> If you had the same page loaded each time, that just dynamically changed the video, I'd have one page object and give it a parameter on initialization rather than creating a page object for each video
2011-04-01T12:42:18  *** isaqual has quit IRC
2011-04-01T12:42:37  <True_Blue> jarib: I understand that, but for someone writing the tests, how do they know what text to pass in with that method?  If the links are "View Mountain Dew Video", "View Coke Video", etc.. sure I can have them guess to just pass in Mountain Dew
2011-04-01T12:42:45  <True_Blue> But they have to know the correct text to pass in
2011-04-01T12:42:48  <True_Blue> for the if statement
2011-04-01T12:43:26  <jarib> True_Blue: the idea is that minor UI changes shouldn't propogate to the test code, so you hide this in the page object
2011-04-01T12:43:50  <jarib> using an enum sounds like a good idea
2011-04-01T12:44:18  <jarib> since then IDE will help the test author to know the possible values
2011-04-01T12:44:45  <andytinkham> True_Blue: backing out to my Cucumber scenarios, my non-automating co-horts would either say "When I view the promotional video for a soda" (if the specific soda didn't matter to the test) or "When I view the promotional video for Mountain Dew" (if the soda did matter to the point of the test). Then my code (and Cucumber) does all the translation
2011-04-01T12:46:01  <andytinkham> For the case where the type of soda didn't matter, my tests will (soon) pick one of the sodas for each run to give the tests a little broader coverage
2011-04-01T12:47:12  <True_Blue> Thats true if you are using Cucumber
2011-04-01T12:47:37  <True_Blue> right now, the tester would be writing page.view_promotional_video("Mountain Dew");
2011-04-01T12:47:45  <True_Blue> But if the tester first looks at the tests and goes to write that
2011-04-01T12:48:03  <True_Blue> How do they know they need to put in Mountain Dew, not View Mountain Dew Promotion, or View Mountain Dew
2011-04-01T12:48:17  <True_Blue> Since its not the same as the links name
2011-04-01T12:48:32  <andytinkham> That's where JariB's enums would come in handy
2011-04-01T12:49:18  <andytinkham> Using Soda.Mountain_Dew would make that clearer than someone having to know the string to use

2011-04-01T12:54:05  <True_Blue> If you had links on a page that werent related to each other, would you do Link.Automobiles, Link.Red, Link.Mountain_Dew, etc?
2011-04-01T12:55:35  <jarib> no,i wouldn't have a Link enum
2011-04-01T12:55:44  <andytinkham> I started to answer one way, but realized you might be talking abotu the enum, not the page object itself
2011-04-01T12:55:58  <jarib> i'd do an enum for each domain "context"
2011-04-01T12:56:19  <andytinkham> If, say, I had a page with promo videos for Mountain Dew, BMW, and Cartier, I'd have an enum of clients or promotional partners or something like that
2011-04-01T12:56:49  <jarib> right
2011-04-01T12:57:12  <True_Blue> Ahh
2011-04-01T12:57:15  <True_Blue> makes sense

2011-04-01T12:57:59  <True_Blue> It sounds like its a lot better if you utilize something like Cucumber
2011-04-01T12:58:00  <andytinkham> If, I had a promo video for Mountain Dew, a wallpaper download for BMW, and a coupon for Wendy's, I might make separate enums (though promotional partners would still apply as well) and have separate page object methods for view the video, download the wallpaper and request a coupon. Whether they were separate enums or not would depend on more business related things.

2011-04-01T12:58:24  <quink|work> hi. I was wondering if someone could help me out using selenium 2
2011-04-01T12:58:24  <jarib> True_Blue: i don't this is very cucumber-specific though
2011-04-01T12:58:37  <jarib> *don't think
2011-04-01T12:58:46  <jarib> quink|work: possibly :)
2011-04-01T12:59:25  <quink|work> I am using the firefox driver and want to select an item that is part of a drop-down menu that only appears when hovered over.
2011-04-01T12:59:31  <quink|work> I can't figure out how to accomplish this.
2011-04-01T12:59:33  <True_Blue> yes but if I have a QA person come in and start to write tests, they seem to have to know enough to do something like page.view_promotional_video("Mountain Dew"), whereas if they had Cucumber they could just right "View promotional video Mountain Dew"
2011-04-01T12:59:41  <andytinkham> True_Blue: I agree with JariB - while I like Cucumber, you can make this work without it as well
2011-04-01T13:00:06  <andytinkham> True_Blue: If you have non-coding people writing tests, Cucumber is a good way to get rid of all that pesky code for them :)
2011-04-01T13:00:14  <True_Blue> yes..
2011-04-01T13:00:22  <sfbrian> plain language test cases are nice in theory but I still think it never works
2011-04-01T13:00:39  <sfbrian> you will never get a product person to write out test cases
2011-04-01T13:01:03  <jarib> quink|work: that's a bit tricky at the moment. the code to do that is going through a massive improvement. what version of Se2?
2011-04-01T13:01:07  <andytinkham> Maybe. My BA's are pretty excited about doing it actually.  We'll see how it goes when I push it out to more people
2011-04-01T13:01:12  <quink|work> jarib: the latest.
2011-04-01T13:01:22  <quink|work> Phew. I thought it was me forgetting how to code.
2011-04-01T13:01:32  <quink|work> (haven't done any java since I got out of school 3 years ago)
2011-04-01T13:01:49  <jarib> quink|work: in the latest release it's only possible in IE, unfortunately
2011-04-01T13:01:58  <jarib> well, IE and HtmlUnit
2011-04-01T13:01:59  <quink|work> Is there a workaround?
2011-04-01T13:02:07  <quink|work> I don't actually care if the hover action is necessary to trigger the link.
2011-04-01T13:02:12  <andytinkham> sfbrian: And I don't expect it to be a they write it and hand it off either. I expect to get in the story discussions with the product people and the developers and the manual testers and have everyone hash things out together. I'm more concerned about the conversation and shared understanding than about whether a non-QA person actually writes the stories
2011-04-01T13:02:13  <quink|work> I just want to hit that specific link.
2011-04-01T13:02:36  <jarib> you may be able to hack it with executScript, but that depends on how the dropdown is implemented
2011-04-01T13:02:48  <jarib> *executeScript
2011-04-01T13:02:54  <quink|work> So there is no way to hit a link directly without it being visible?
2011-04-01T13:02:55  <andytinkham> (and my non-automating QA people WILL write test cases which will still take some load off of me, even if the product managers and BAs don't do it)
2011-04-01T13:02:58  * jarib shakes fist at crappy cafe wifi
2011-04-01T13:03:27  <quink|work> I'd not mind hitting a nonvisible link. I don't particularly care how I make it work, i just want it accessed through that link.
2011-04-01T13:03:30  <sfbrian> that's true... we use testlink to keep a repo of test cases that the non-auto QA people write in
2011-04-01T13:04:28  <jimevans> quink|work: as long as you're using the WebDriver API, no, the link must be visible before you can click on it.
2011-04-01T13:04:28  <quink|work> So would it be best to spend time learning selenium 2 or selenium 1 when it comes to marketable skills?
2011-04-01T13:06:04  <True_Blue> you can use Javascript to make it visible
2011-04-01T13:06:07  <True_Blue> Thats what I have done before
2011-04-01T13:06:15  <True_Blue> I run javascript and make it visible, then click it
2011-04-01T13:06:23  <antlong> quink|work probably best to start w/ javascript
2011-04-01T13:06:45  <quink|work> I'm not familiar with how to inject javascript into selenium test cases.

2011-04-01T13:07:17  <True_Blue> Use the JavascriptExecuter
2011-04-01T13:07:51  <True_Blue> I had a dropdown menu that the links in the menu wouldnt show up until you hover over the Menu
2011-04-01T13:08:00  <True_Blue> But when I used hover(), it would show it for a second and then close
2011-04-01T13:08:06  <True_Blue> not allowing me to click the links underneeth
2011-04-01T13:08:22  <True_Blue> So I used Javascript to find the Menu Link, then to find all of its sublinks and make them all visible
2011-04-01T13:08:23  <sfbrian> ugh hover()
2011-04-01T13:08:25  <quink|work> I haven't found any hover() in this beta.
2011-04-01T13:08:29  <True_Blue> then I clicked on the one I needed
2011-04-01T13:08:47  <jimevans> quink|work: it was deprecated in 2.0b2, removed for java in 2.0b3.
2011-04-01T13:09:18  <True_Blue> Its a hack for sure, but it worked for what I needed
2011-04-01T13:09:54  <jimevans> True_Blue: on the site you were having trouble with hover(), were you using jquery perhaps (or some other js widget framework)?
2011-04-01T13:10:28  <True_Blue> Yeah it uses JQuery
2011-04-01T13:10:40  <jimevans> and was this perhaps in IE, or did you see it in other browsers too?
2011-04-01T13:10:46  <True_Blue> Firefox
2011-04-01T13:10:58  <jimevans> ok. thanks for the information.
2011-04-01T13:11:15  <True_Blue> I would use hover(), in the browser it would make the sublinks appear, and then a second later it was gone.  Sometimes the findElement would be fast enough to find it, but usually not
2011-04-01T13:11:38  <jimevans> i noticed in some of my hover() test that for jquery sites, if the mouse pointer was actually over the page in question when i ran the test, i'd see that behaviour.
2011-04-01T13:11:42  <True_Blue> So I did the hack where I found the main menu link, and then cycled through each sublink making each one visible
2011-04-01T13:11:56  <True_Blue> Ahh
2011-04-01T13:13:05  <jimevans> i don't know if that's unique to jquery, but it seemed more prevalent on jquery sites.
2011-04-01T13:13:49  <True_Blue> A lot more of our pages are using JQuery

Would you be able to point me at the part of the selenium code that handles clicking a selected element. We have a dev here who is proficient in jQuery and wants to be what about jQuery might be causing the issue we discussed yesterday.
2011-04-01T13:40:25  <jimevans> QAguy: the atoms in question are in $/javascript/atoms; however, the problem may be in the way the javascript is compiled by the closure compiler.
2011-04-01T13:40:56  <jimevans> the actual javascript sent to ie for execution is in $/cpp/IEDriver/atoms.h.
2011-04-01T13:41:04  <jimevans> note that this is a C++ header file.
2011-04-01T13:41:19  <QAguy> jimevans: Excellent. Thanks Jim.
2011-04-01T13:41:30  <QAguy> have a great weekend

2011-04-01T13:49:36  <sfbrian> hahaha
2011-04-01T13:50:02  <jimevans> i particularly like the "Testing Type" dropdown.

2011-04-01T13:53:27  <antlong> eranm, are you switch_to_default_content after you go to a frame? i got snagged by that
2011-04-01T13:54:40  <eranm> antlong: the issue in question happens on the first switchTo().frame(...) call in the test. New browser, new page.
2011-04-01T13:55:23  *** kylls has quit IRC
2011-04-01T13:55:24  <antlong> eranm, ah. yeah i noticed that in the firefox driver yesterday. it seemed like it wasnt waiting for the frame to be there before switching to it
2011-04-01T13:55:45  *** Archdude_ has joined #selenium
2011-04-01T13:56:18  *** Archdude_ has quit IRC
2011-04-01T13:56:31  <eranm> The driver assumes the frame element is already there when it's instructed to switch to it.
2011-04-01T13:57:01  <antlong> yeah, it just needs to implicitly wait
2011-04-01T13:57:04  *** Archdude_ has joined #selenium
2011-04-01T13:57:13  <antlong> simonstewart ^
2011-04-01T13:57:25  <eranm> This test case happens to have a wait for the element and it's found - but after switching to it the IE driver could not find any other element (or get the page source). Works perfectly fine on the Firefox driver
2011-04-01T13:57:55  *** Archdude has quit IRC
2011-04-01T13:57:55  *** Archdude_ is now known as Archdude
2011-04-01T14:00:51  <antlong> eranm, what do you get if you print current_url after you switch frames
2011-04-01T14:02:50  <eranm> antlong: Since it's working with the version of the IE driver against trunk, I'll have to run it against the old version the issue was reported with to find out.
2011-04-01T14:03:20  <antlong> eranm, i only ask because i had the same exact issue that we were discussing a day or two ago
2011-04-01T14:03:33  <andytinkham> I want to have a config file in my ruby suite that specifies things like my base url, my database DSN name, user name, and password, and things like that, with values defined for each environment I run the tests in. Is using a YAML file the preferred way to do this, or is this some other method I should consider?
2011-04-01T14:03:36  *** quink|work has left #selenium
2011-04-01T14:04:02  <eranm> antlong: does it still happen against trunk?
2011-04-01T14:04:07  <antlong> yup
2011-04-01T14:04:10  <eranm> Hmm
2011-04-01T14:04:13  *** adamgroucher has quit IRC
2011-04-01T14:04:22  <eranm> Is it on Firefox or IE?
2011-04-01T14:04:28  <antlong> firefox, i dont have IE
2011-04-01T14:04:56  <eranm> The issue I'm talking about was on IE only. Would be interesting to read the issue description for your case, though, if there's one open on the issue tracker.
2011-04-01T14:06:26  <antlong> mine actually threw this: E       NoSuchElementException: Was not on a page, so could not find elements
2011-04-01T14:06:36  <antlong> which yours probably would too - its probably just getting swallowed somewhere
2011-04-01T14:06:44  *** brettporter has joined #selenium
2011-04-01T14:07:03  <eranm> antlong: nope, the frame element is being found.
2011-04-01T14:07:03  <True_Blue> What do you think of the idea of having a getDropdown method on the Page Object that does this: page.setOptionInProductDropown(PRODUCT.CALCULATOR, "TI-90") or you could do page.setOptionInProductDropdown(PRODUCT.ANIMAL, "Pig")
2011-04-01T14:07:04  *** brettporter has quit IRC
2011-04-01T14:07:25  <True_Blue> Then the Page Object would grab the appropriate dropdown and select the option asked for
2011-04-01T14:07:31  <antlong> eranm, right but the next command is failing
2011-04-01T14:07:37  <antlong> eranm, which is where i got that error
2011-04-01T14:08:15  <andytinkham> True_Blue: I think you're in for maintenance headaches if something gets changed from a drop down to some other control and you've used a page object method like that throughout your tests
2011-04-01T14:08:16  <jimevans> True_Blue: I still wouldn't like it as an abstraction layer.
2011-04-01T14:08:52  <True_Blue> What would be a better way to go about it?  Sorry, I'm still on this, trying to find a better way
2011-04-01T14:09:27  <andytinkham> True_Blue: I'd still advocate thinking about what a user would be trying to accomplish on the page and basing your page object public interfaces on that
2011-04-01T14:09:49  <jimevans> ^^ what he said.
2011-04-01T14:10:27  <andytinkham> Users don't go to a page to select a value from a dropdown generally - they have a more abstract goal than that
2011-04-01T14:10:27  <jimevans> Think about it this way, the user isn't selecting an option in a product dropdown, the user is choosing a calculator.
2011-04-01T14:11:23  <True_Blue> true.  I think I may be understanding.  I realize that if you are at a form, usually you want to fill out the form and submit it
2011-04-01T14:11:29  <True_Blue> I was thinking of things like Validation
2011-04-01T14:11:36  <True_Blue> Where you may only want to select one dropdown
2011-04-01T14:11:40  <True_Blue> not all of them
2011-04-01T14:11:52  <andytinkham> (Making this mental shift from thinking about how a page was built to thinking about the business goals was a bit of an a-ha moment for me. It took me a while to really wrap my head around it at first)
2011-04-01T14:12:57  <andytinkham> My validation is expressed at the level that has the knowledge to do it, with a caveat that I always want the top level to specify what it's checking, and not just do some seemingly random action and not explicitly check anything since all the checking is done at a lower level
2011-04-01T14:12:59  *** PhysSent has joined #selenium
2011-04-01T14:13:23  <True_Blue> Maybe that's my problem, I'm thinking about how as a developer I would test validation on a page, instead of writing methods that will do the validation for me
2011-04-01T14:14:28  <PhysSent> After upgrading to Selenium 2 beta 3 (to fix a bug), I get an error with get_eval('jQuery(selenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow().document).find...
2011-04-01T14:14:49  <PhysSent> It claims jQuery is undefined on this session. Any tips to upgrading my call?
2011-04-01T14:15:02  <antlong> True_Blue, http://d.pr/hraw
2011-04-01T14:16:39  <antlong> True_Blue, also dont be afraid to get the elements in the dropdown at test time.
2011-04-01T14:16:59  <True_Blue> Looking now
2011-04-01T14:17:19  *** toseter has quit IRC
2011-04-01T14:18:13  *** nitin_ has quit IRC
2011-04-01T14:20:37  <antlong> True_Blue, i forgot to note, with the generator you have the option of doing the find_element_by_id and stuff in the test function, or in the generator function
2011-04-01T14:20:55  <antlong> True_Blue, thats why each_type is an arg in test_calc
2011-04-01T14:21:10  <True_Blue> So if you had 5 links on a page, that each go to a different product of the company, would it be better to do something along the lines of page.getToProductA(), page.getToProductB(), etc... or page.getToProduct(Product.A), page.getToProduct(Product.B)
2011-04-01T14:21:16  <True_Blue> antlog: I see that
2011-04-01T14:22:21  <antlong> True_Blue same format as my paste
2011-04-01T14:22:24  <jarib> True_Blue: i'd probably do page.selectProduct(Product.A), but yeah
2011-04-01T14:22:24  <PhysSent> Never mind, I found the problem. I had added jquery as a userextension to my old selenium server jar file.
2011-04-01T14:23:20  <antlong> True_Blue, it doesnt really make sense to explictly write that out
2011-04-01T14:23:28  <antlong> True_Blue, let the programming language do the work for you
2011-04-01T14:24:29  <jarib> antlong: i think we're giving opposing advice here
2011-04-01T14:25:52  <antlong> possibly :)
2011-04-01T14:26:06  <antlong> pythoners and rubyists often do though ;)
2011-04-01T14:26:22  <True_Blue> heh I'm writing my stuff in Java, which seems to be different than everyone else
2011-04-01T14:27:00  <True_Blue> The fact is, I have about 8 links on my page.  I have 5 that takes me to different product pages, and then I have 3 that are in the footer
2011-04-01T14:27:01  <antlong> True_Blue http://d.pr/UORC
2011-04-01T14:27:09  <jimevans> True_Blue: try being a C# guy
2011-04-01T14:27:37  <antlong> True_Blue, a lot of this is really a matter of personal preference tbh
2011-04-01T14:27:41  <True_Blue> I know
2011-04-01T14:27:47  <True_Blue> And I know there's different ways to do it
2011-04-01T14:28:04  <True_Blue> I want to make sure that any WebDriver API calls are out of my tests
2011-04-01T14:28:13  <antlong> huh?
2011-04-01T14:28:13  <True_Blue> But I'm trying to find the best way to structure my Page Objects
2011-04-01T14:28:37  <True_Blue> My tests do not reference driver at all, they only call Page Object methods
2011-04-01T14:28:39  <jarib> you're on the right path :)
2011-04-01T14:29:42  <True_Blue> Before, as I mentioned, I would have methods like page.clickProductALink(), page.clickProductBLink, etc... but it seems a lot better to do something like page.getToProductPage(PRODUCT.A)
2011-04-01T14:29:48  <antlong> True_Blue, theres no real right answer, you can make an object for those links at the page (url) level, at the header and footer level, it really depends on how often it appears
2011-04-01T14:30:08  <jimevans> right then. remote broadcast tonight, so i've got to scoot. those of you going to SeConf, i'll see you next week.
2011-04-01T14:30:27  <jarib> have fun jimevans
2011-04-01T14:30:36  <antlong> True_Blue, clickProductALink() doesnt make sense, i can tell you that much
2011-04-01T14:30:43  <antlong> True_Blue, youd need to write 5 methods then
2011-04-01T14:30:46  <True_Blue> heh so I've learned
2011-04-01T14:30:51  <True_Blue> Thats what lead me onto here
2011-04-01T14:30:54  <jarib> jimevans: you're arriving late on sunday?
2011-04-01T14:31:09  <andytinkham> jimevans: see you next week!
2011-04-01T14:31:14  <jimevans> jarib: yeah, like 2300
2011-04-01T14:31:21  <jarib> ah, k
2011-04-01T14:31:22  <antlong> True_Blue, use data structures to house your objects, then have a singular method to use them
2011-04-01T14:31:38  *** jimevans has left #selenium
2011-04-01T14:32:14  <antlong> True_Blue, it would make much more sense to have a method called navigateTo() that took an arg, than to have navigateToFoo(), navigateToBar()
2011-04-01T14:32:28  <antlong> plus you would be able to reuse it anywhere
2011-04-01T14:33:00  <True_Blue> true, good point.  But then wouldn't the list of enums be big?
2011-04-01T14:33:38  <antlong> True_Blue, that really shouldnt be a concern
2011-04-01T14:34:22  <antlong> its more practical to have a large list of 10 lines and one method, than to have 10 methods of 3 lines
2011-04-01T14:34:49  <antlong> you only need to add an item to a list, or change a list item instead of messing with individual methods
2011-04-01T14:36:25  <True_Blue> How about multiple ways of getting to the same page?
2011-04-01T14:36:26  <antlong> jarib, what do you think
2011-04-01T14:37:08  <antlong> True_Blue, i would say having a method for each navigational case would suffice
2011-04-01T14:38:59  <antlong> True_Blue, aim for the highest amount of reuse, and smallest amount of writing
2011-04-01T14:40:07  <antlong> im out, have a good one
2011-04-01T14:40:10  *** antlong has quit IRC
2011-04-01T14:40:38  <True_Blue> For instance, I am trying to get to a page that is 4 pages deep.

2011-04-01T14:41:56  *** gronky has quit IRC
2011-04-01T14:42:30  <andytinkham> True_Blue: While it may not be antlong's recommendation, in my world, there would be 4 page objects like you have. At the conceptual layer would be a method that corresponded to the overall goal of that chain. The tests would call the conceptual layer model
2011-04-01T14:42:41  <andytinkham> s/model/method/
2011-04-01T14:43:27  <True_Blue> I like the seperate pages
2011-04-01T14:43:41  <True_Blue> I'm just trying to figure out the best way for me to interact with the elements
2011-04-01T14:45:05  <andytinkham> Maybe I'm missing where the question is, but it seems to me that the elements on each page are interacted with internally to each of those 4 methods you list
2011-04-01T14:47:09  <simonstewart> Sod it
2011-04-01T14:47:17  <simonstewart> I've decided that everyone's right
2011-04-01T14:47:22  <simonstewart> we should just move to a dvcs
2011-04-01T14:47:58  <simonstewart> the problem is that mercurial isn't trendy enough and git isn't appropriate
2011-04-01T14:48:36  <simonstewart> I have a plan though
2011-04-01T14:48:58  <simonstewart> First of all, what do we want from a dvcs?
2011-04-01T14:49:05  <simonstewart> 1) Offline working on multiple branches
2011-04-01T14:49:13  <simonstewart> 2) The ability to have a local repo
2011-04-01T14:49:14  <simonstewart> Right?

2011-04-01T14:50:35  <jleyba> quick straw poll: how many people use the ChromeBinary, ChromeExtension, and or ChromeProfile classes?
2011-04-01T14:50:42  <simonstewart> I do
2011-04-01T14:50:59  <simonstewart> First: I'm doing an svn dump of the entire repo
2011-04-01T14:51:07  <simonstewart> Then I'm going to upload that to dropbox
2011-04-01T14:51:18  <jarib> :D
2011-04-01T14:51:21  <simonstewart> And if anyone wants to, they can create their own "fork" by downloading
2011-04-01T14:51:22  <jarib> lol
2011-04-01T14:51:44  <simonstewart> Since it's unlikely that the repos need concurrent access, I may switch back to something simpler
2011-04-01T14:51:47  <simonstewart> Like RCS

2011-04-01T14:58:23  <ahfeel> hi jleyba
2011-04-01T14:58:32  <True_Blue> Whats the difference between using an enum and a public constant By?  So, I could either do page.navigateTo(Product.Calculator) or I could do page.navigateTo(CALCULATOR_PAGE) where CALCULATOR_PAGE is defined as By.linkText("Calculator").  if I use enum, in the navigateTo I'd see each one it was and then follow that link, in the constant i would just do a driver.findElement(locator_passed_in).click()
2011-04-01T14:58:39  *** davehunt has joined #selenium
2011-04-01T15:00:17  <ahfeel> jleyba: we managed to get a very minimal test case that makes By.name() fails on IE. As soon as we add a property to the Object.prototype, we get a javascript error when running By.name()
2011-04-01T15:00:37  <simonstewart> Interesting
2011-04-01T15:00:43  <ahfeel> jleyba: it used to work properly with the old, non atom based, IE driver
2011-04-01T15:00:48  <simonstewart> It's because we construct an object when doing a find

2011-04-01T15:01:16  <ahfeel> rofl, yeah
2011-04-01T15:01:27  <simonstewart> I guess that we should really survive people modifying Object.prototype

2011-04-01T15:01:37  <simonstewart> (*sigh*)
2011-04-01T15:01:37  <ahfeel> you used to :)
2011-04-01T15:01:47  <simonstewart> But the IE driver has been atomized
2011-04-01T15:01:52  <simonstewart> And the atoms use this pattern
2011-04-01T15:02:06  <andytinkham> True_Blue: I think that may be largely a style preference or dictated by the skills of the people who might also be making those function calls
2011-04-01T15:03:11  <ahfeel> simonstewart: all of them ? do they strongly rely on this ?
2011-04-01T15:03:23  <simonstewart> pretty much
2011-04-01T15:03:38  <simonstewart> I'm a little surprised anything else works

2011-04-01T15:04:27  <True_Blue> Are the approaches any different really though?  A person could define a bunch of By's as constants, and then pass those in to the page.navigateTo() method
2011-04-01T15:07:12  <ahfeel> simonstewart: so it's not an easy fix :(
2011-04-01T15:07:17  <True_Blue> Ok here's a new question for you, when I navigate to the Calculator page, I want a Calculator object returned.  When I navigate to the Game page, I want a Game object returned.  So befoe I had, clickCalculatorLink which returned a CalculatorPage, and I had a clickGameLink which returned a GamePage
2011-04-01T15:07:27  <True_Blue> If I tried to roll these into one method where I pass a param..
2011-04-01T15:07:30  <ahfeel> simonstewart: or could you just lookup the properties you are actually waiting for in this object ?
2011-04-01T15:07:35  <True_Blue> How can i have it return different Page Objects
2011-04-01T15:07:37  <simonstewart> jleyba: what do you think?
2011-04-01T15:07:48  <simonstewart> Which is what we'd need to do
2011-04-01T15:08:07  <simonstewart> Or do a check for "hasOwnProperty"

2011-04-01T15:08:15  <ahfeel> yup

2011-04-01T15:08:37  <jleyba> Is it a lame "for (var key in obj)"?
2011-04-01T15:09:01  <andytinkham> True_Blue: In Java, you probably need to define a page object interface and make all your page object conform to that. Then the method returns an instance of your interface which happens to be the right page object.
2011-04-01T15:09:12  <simonstewart> goog.object.getAnyKey

2011-04-01T15:14:19  <True_Blue> I'm just not sure.  A seperate click may be needed
2011-04-01T15:14:28  <True_Blue> Since its returning a different page
2011-04-01T15:14:34  <True_Blue> Depending upon what link is clicked
2011-04-01T15:15:52  <True_Blue> so I may end up with page.navigateToCalculator(), page.navigateToGame(), etc.  I just don't like it
2011-04-01T15:16:02  <True_Blue> Its only for click() though
2011-04-01T15:16:08  <True_Blue> So maybe it wouldnt be so bad

2011-04-01T15:21:05  <andytinkham> Good luck! I'd like to hear how you end up addressing all this
2011-04-01T15:21:52  <True_Blue> no problem, I'll probably be on here for the next week asking advice heh

2011-04-01T15:23:13  <True_Blue> I should have went with Ruby.  But we are a Java shop and overall I think its best to stick with it

2011-04-01T15:25:36  <andytinkham> True_Blue: I understand the language dilemma. We're a .Net shop here for the app, and I waffled a little bit about whether to stick with C# which I had worked with just before this job and which my devs know, or go with Ruby which is what I have always worked with Selenium with before
2011-04-01T15:27:06  <True_Blue> I used to use WebRat a lot for Ruby at a Ruby on Rails shop, and then we dabbled in Selenium.  Then the last two places I worked have both been Java shops
2011-04-01T15:27:11  <True_Blue> So I have focused more on that
2011-04-01T15:27:16  <jarib> jleyba: `./go //rb:chromedriver-test DEBUG=1` will print the commands sent / responses

2011-04-01T18:49:36  <jleyba> as far as extending the wire protocol, how about GET /session returning a list of active session IDs?
2011-04-01T18:50:10  <jarib> for IE, we handle this in C#/Ruby by looking at the session count (through a native function call)
2011-04-01T18:50:14  <jarib> not yet java
2011-04-01T18:50:16  <jarib> GET /session sounds good
2011-04-01T18:51:18  <jarib> if you look at InternetExplorerDriverServer.cs you'll see how it's done for IE
2011-04-01T18:52:00  <jleyba> What if we just make chromedriver a singleton in Java?
2011-04-01T18:52:42  <jarib> ChromeDriver? or a ChromeDriverServer singleton?
2011-04-01T18:53:05  <jleyba> ChromeDriverServer
2011-04-01T18:53:09  <jarib> right
2011-04-01T18:53:16  <jarib> that makes sense
2011-04-01T18:53:28  <jleyba> First time you request a new ChromeDriver(), we start the chromedriver server in a subprocess.
2011-04-01T18:53:37  <jleyba> Then we just let it run until Java dies
2011-04-01T18:53:55  <jleyba> So we're not constantly starting/stopping the server
2011-04-01T18:54:47  <jarib> right. the only difference with IE is that we check the session count whenever driver.quit() is called
2011-04-01T18:54:54  <jarib> and if we're the last session, we also shut down the server
2011-04-01T18:55:58  <jarib> so new IEDriver() checks if the server is already running, if not start it
2011-04-01T18:56:14  <jarib> and driver.quit() checks if we're the last session, and if so, stop the server
2011-04-01T18:56:22  <jleyba> Sounds good to me
2011-04-01T18:56:31  <jarib> cool
