2011-02-25T01:47:01  <ahfeel> hey seleguys, I'm having issues with the 2.0b(1|2) with the IE Driver
2011-02-25T01:47:43  <ahfeel> on some websites the By.xpath method does not work the way it used to, i mean By.xpath("//span[@name='doRemoveSecurityProvider']") used to work, but it doesn't anymore
2011-02-25T01:47:47  <ahfeel> WHILE
2011-02-25T01:47:58  <ahfeel> By.xpath("//span[contains(@name, 'doRemoveSecurityProvider')]) still works
2011-02-25T01:48:45  <ahfeel> and the DOM element is correct, that's quite strange
2011-02-25T01:49:38  <ahfeel> plus, it works perfectly with the firefox driver
2011-02-25T01:54:54  <ahfeel> mh, i'll wait for jimevans :)

2011-02-25T05:04:07  <mseidl> question:  regarding an ssl-cert pop up, it says it does it automatically, but it is not.  i have changed the settings in firefox to never ask for this, but, when selenium launches it must use a new profile because it doesnt save/use any stored settings

2011-02-25T05:13:35  *** mbeierl has joined #selenium
2011-02-25T05:15:45  <jarib> mseidl: what language?
2011-02-25T05:16:30  <jarib> first thing to try is to tweak the FirefoxProfile assumeUntrustedIssuer setting (can't remember the exact method)
2011-02-25T05:16:35  <mseidl> python
2011-02-25T05:16:40  <mseidl> jarib: ^
2011-02-25T05:17:21  <jarib> ok. not sure how this is exposed in python
2011-02-25T05:17:36  <jarib> mseidl: if it doesn't work automatically, that's a bug
2011-02-25T05:18:18  <jarib> it'd be interesting to see a screenshot of Firefox' error console at the point the popup occurs
2011-02-25T05:18:40  <jarib> some of the certificate override messages are logged there
2011-02-25T05:19:03  <mseidl> ok, let me check
2011-02-25T05:20:19  <mseidl> jarib: no errors, warnings,
2011-02-25T05:21:53  <jarib> mseidl: have a screenshot of the popup? a popup sounds weird for firefox, usually it's just an error page
2011-02-25T05:22:34  <jarib> "assume untruested issuer" is set to true by default, but sometimes i've seen self-signed certs work after setting it to false
2011-02-25T05:22:47  <jarib> i don't know enough about ssl certs to really understand what's going on
2011-02-25T05:22:54  <mseidl> neither do i :)
2011-02-25T05:23:14  <jarib> and you'll have to hang around and ask AutomatedTester for the python equivalent
2011-02-25T05:23:22  <mseidl> ok, thanks

2011-02-25T06:24:35  <balou> if you build grid-common
2011-02-25T06:24:53  <balou> then deploy the jar in the target folder to your local maven repository

2011-02-25T11:50:58  <lawcab> hello there
2011-02-25T11:51:03  <lawcab> just a quick question
2011-02-25T11:51:14  <lawcab> I am using FireFoxDriver
2011-02-25T11:51:20  <lawcab> and I am using webelement.
2011-02-25T11:51:35  <lawcab> I need to select the 2nd element in a dropdown
2011-02-25T11:51:43  <lawcab> how can I do that?
2011-02-25T11:56:33  <antlong> [2]
2011-02-25T11:56:44  <antlong> or [1] depending on the language
2011-02-25T11:57:59  <lawcab> I am using in java
2011-02-25T11:58:12  <lawcab> do i just use setSelected([2]);
2011-02-25T11:58:38  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-02-25T12:00:45  <antlong> i dont know anything about java, couldnt tell you.
2011-02-25T12:01:01  <antlong> figure out the type, and use the appropriate indice

2011-02-25T12:07:03  <rolando_> I don't get the use of driver.implicitly_wait(3) in python. It should use after a click on a element? The doc says "... for use by later actions". is like a global setting?
2011-02-25T12:07:35  <antlong> its a terrible implementation
2011-02-25T12:07:43  <antlong> but you call it like you would call time.sleep()
2011-02-25T12:07:49  *** ner0x has joined #selenium
2011-02-25T12:14:00  <rolando_> my test run fine in firefox, but in chrome fails with NoSuchElement, could be an issue that needs implicit wait? or time.sleep?
2011-02-25T12:14:09  <antlong> probably
2011-02-25T12:14:18  <antlong> or the locator is not cross browser safe
2011-02-25T12:15:25  <antlong> jarib, do you still work on se1's bindings?

2011-02-25T13:09:10  <XCulver> why would the chrome driver give me an error ".\common\json_pref_store.cc(48) - Error reading Preferences: File doesn't exist. C:\Users\....\AppData\Local\Temp\webdriver1259211487-chrome.profile\Local State: The system cannot find the file specified.
2011-02-25T13:09:27  <XCulver> rights on the test runner?
2011-02-25T13:09:42  <antlong> the file doesnt exist
2011-02-25T13:10:01  <XCulver> i can open up chrome and load the test site manually
2011-02-25T13:10:13  <XCulver> when my msbuild script executes it
2011-02-25T13:10:15  <XCulver> i get that error
2011-02-25T13:10:32  <XCulver> and chrome opens up multiple times
2011-02-25T13:10:36  <XCulver> ie works fine
2011-02-25T13:10:40  <antlong> what does that tell you
2011-02-25T13:12:25  <XCulver> looks like my testrunner calling chrome can't access its stored chrome profile
2011-02-25T13:12:43  <antlong> rather the profile is being created incorrectly
2011-02-25T13:13:08  <XCulver> where is chrome creating the profile?
2011-02-25T13:13:42  <antlong> chrome isnt creating the profile, its somewhere in launcherUtils, or near it
2011-02-25T13:13:55  <XCulver> when chrome loads
2011-02-25T13:13:59  <XCulver> it opens up correctly
2011-02-25T13:14:08  <XCulver> one tab for the command executor
2011-02-25T13:14:12  <XCulver> then the 2nd tab for my page
2011-02-25T13:14:16  <XCulver> then the whole thing closes
2011-02-25T13:14:20  <XCulver> and it opens up again
2011-02-25T13:14:31  <antlong> ok
2011-02-25T13:14:50  <XCulver> i'm loading it the same way it is done in the selenium2 tests
2011-02-25T13:15:00  <XCulver> in the source code for selenium2 .net
2011-02-25T13:15:03  *** andreasfruhen has quit IRC
2011-02-25T13:16:31  <XCulver> I like the way the tests are loaded for each browser in the selenium source
2011-02-25T13:16:36  <XCulver> so i'm doing it similar
2011-02-25T13:16:50  <XCulver> with a msbuild.xml script pushing a new config file for each browser
2011-02-25T13:17:04  <XCulver> and running all the tests against the new config file

2011-02-25T14:21:24  <XCulver> the chrome driver's constructor makes a profile
2011-02-25T14:21:35  <XCulver> a new ChromeProfile()
2011-02-25T14:24:30  <antlong> im pretty sure thats the file you are looking for
2011-02-25T14:24:54  <antlong> if you dont pass in a profile, it makes one, and that is where its made afaics
2011-02-25T14:25:14  <XCulver> the constructor for the driver doesn't accept a profile
