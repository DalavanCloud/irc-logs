2011-07-15T03:03:31  <selbot2>  open/new python webdriver can use proxy? - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2058
2011-07-15T03:03:52  *** Mayank has quit IRC
2011-07-15T03:03:52  <AutomatedTester> dawagner: I havent done anything specific for the proxt
2011-07-15T03:04:04  <AutomatedTester> I need to have a look at how the Java code does it and emulate
2011-07-15T03:04:07  <dawagner> (I know in Java proxy-setting could certainly do with some more documentation, but I think that's largely because we don't have a neat way of doing so in the API at the moment)
2011-07-15T03:04:45  *** Mayank has joined #selenium
2011-07-15T03:04:57  <AutomatedTester> dawagner: if you can put the relevant details for me to test/ fix in the issue I will look at it
2011-07-15T03:05:22  <AutomatedTester> i have no idea about the proxy so dont really know where to start
2011-07-15T03:05:32  <AutomatedTester> but it feels like it should be quick to sort
2011-07-15T03:05:51  <dawagner> AFAIK at the moment in Java our answer is basically:
2011-07-15T03:06:25  <dawagner> Firefox? Use a FirefoxProfile.  HtmlUnit? We'll give you some magic. IE and Chrome use system settings, so you should set those yourself manually.
2011-07-15T03:06:59  <AutomatedTester> well if that is the case then all bindings can do a proxy
2011-07-15T03:07:46  <simonstewart> Eh?
2011-07-15T03:07:53  <simonstewart> The correct thing to do is to set up a Proxy object
2011-07-15T03:08:01  <simonstewart> and then stuff that in the DesiredCapabilities
2011-07-15T03:08:04  <simonstewart> With the key "proxy"
2011-07-15T03:08:09  <simonstewart> And Magic Will Happen
2011-07-15T03:08:28  <AutomatedTester> is there an example?
2011-07-15T03:08:35  * AutomatedTester doesnt care what language
2011-07-15T03:08:36  <dawagner> https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#Q:_I_need_to_use_a_proxy._How_do_I_configure_that?
2011-07-15T03:08:44  <jarib> AutomatedTester: the ruby bindings do that
2011-07-15T03:08:50  <jarib> i've ignored IE / Chrome
2011-07-15T03:09:03  <simonstewart> Yes, that's how you configure it
2011-07-15T03:09:05  <jarib> since it hopefully will be changed to use the same mechanism to configure the proxy
2011-07-15T03:09:44  <AutomatedTester> right, that should be easy to do
2011-07-15T03:10:24  *** sdimkov has joined #selenium
2011-07-15T03:10:25  <simonstewart> Yeah. We'll tweak chrome
2011-07-15T03:10:36  <simonstewart> IE needs code sunk into the C++ layer
2011-07-15T03:10:57  <dawagner> IIRC Chrome has the proxy stuff wired up now, so it just needs a little wiring
2011-07-15T03:11:06  <AutomatedTester> does the server do the htmlunit magic forme?
2011-07-15T03:11:12  <dawagner> Can IE be made to use a proxy other than the system proxy?
2011-07-15T03:11:15  <AutomatedTester> for me even
2011-07-15T03:11:39  <simonstewart> Nope

2011-07-15T06:51:06  <AutomatedTester> for me community is very important
2011-07-15T06:51:21  <RossPatterson> Me too.  I put 12 years into running SHARE.
2011-07-15T06:51:48  <RossPatterson> And about the same into a local mainframe group called HillGang.
2011-07-15T06:52:50  <RossPatterson> There's nothing like sharing experiences between actual practitioners.  With all due respects to our consultant brethren, consultants have a different viewpoint.
2011-07-15T06:53:09  <olle_hacknighter> RossPatterson: Maybe you can make a heads-together hackathon instead? A "meetup" has its own impracticalities, such as not being able to interact that much practically (listen to the speaker is mostly the Event, that, and beer).

2011-07-15T07:49:36  <simonstewart> jimevans: I take it you're just moving the string mangling into the else block of the element finder?

2011-07-15T07:50:03  *** ksutardji1 has quit IRC
2011-07-15T07:50:27  <jimevans> um no, changing the string mangling to only happen if the find mechanism is link text or partial link text.
2011-07-15T07:50:49  <jimevans> the string mangling happens before the code gets to the ElementFinder class.
2011-07-15T07:51:28  <simonstewart> Right. But if you delete it from the command handlers and sink it into the element finder you can also reduce code duplication
2011-07-15T07:51:32  <jimevans> gotta clean and rebuild to get the updated sizzle.
2011-07-15T07:51:45  <simonstewart> Because it's only a problem when creating the concatenated strings
2011-07-15T07:51:47  <jimevans> yes, i could. :)
2011-07-15T07:52:14  <simonstewart> And that only happens in the final "else" block of the element finder

2011-07-15T08:24:23  <tunabum> yep
2011-07-15T08:24:32  <ian_mac_> b/c of Subversion allows you to check out just a subtree of a repository; Git requires you to clone the entire repository (including history) and create a working copy that mirrors at least a subset of the items under version control.?
2011-07-15T08:25:00  <ian_mac_> binaries you generate?
2011-07-15T08:25:05  <ian_mac_> i.e. builds?
2011-07-15T08:25:09  <simonstewart> Yeah. the lack of history really helps with svn
2011-07-15T08:25:19  <simonstewart> the prebuilt binaries, that allow us to release from any machine

2011-07-15T09:38:57  <jimevans> the jquery thing i was struggling with yesterday in ie.
2011-07-15T09:39:22  <jimevans> jarib pointed out to me that firefox on linux, not using native events, didn't have that problem.
2011-07-15T09:39:38  <jimevans> which meant that the click automation atom would fire the jquery event.
2011-07-15T09:40:12  <jimevans> added the click atom to ie for option elements under a select element, and boom, it worked.
2011-07-15T09:40:57  <simonstewart> nice
2011-07-15T09:41:01  <simonstewart> very nice

2011-07-15T09:49:18  <bbrewer> Hi - I hope someone can help me with a ruby WebDriver q. How do I send an escape keypress to the browser? I'm trying to do this: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=687#c4 (example given is in Java, I'm trying to do it in ruby)

2011-07-15T09:50:20  <bbrewer> I figured out how to send esc by calling through driver.find_element().send_keys but find_element blocks on page load so that won't work for me.

2011-07-15T10:08:59  <whitecat> Hello I have a question about Selenium IDE.  I am trying to automate testing of my website, but I need to create data and delete data that is assigned numbers by my database. After I create the data with selenium. I want to click on a link that contains the newly generated string. But How can I automate that with Selenium IDE?

2011-07-15T10:12:27  <whitecat> Am i asking this question in the wrong place?
2011-07-15T10:13:03  <jimevans> whitecat: this is the right place, but you're at the mercy of the skill set of those in the room.
2011-07-15T10:13:11  <jimevans> i, for example, know nothing about IDE.

2011-07-15T10:14:55  *** gogo` has joined #selenium
2011-07-15T10:19:08  <whitecat> I am using the IDE becasue it will be easier for my team to understand and use in testing. They dont like learning new tools.
2011-07-15T10:20:34  <whitecat> Is there a command for the tab key?
2011-07-15T10:20:53  <RossPatterson> There don't tend to be a lot of IDE users in this place, but some of us know enough IDE to be dangerous.  What's your issue?
2011-07-15T10:23:46  <whitecat> I want to automate a test. But I need to click a link that is in the same location on the screen but can have a different name. so I cannot use the click command.
2011-07-15T10:25:39  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-07-15T10:26:38  <RossPatterson> Sure you can.  There are many different ways to identify a link, and its position within the HTML document is one of them.  Selenium supports both XPath and CSS selectors as ways, among other options.
2011-07-15T10:26:40  <RossPatterson> Check out http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-core/1.0.1/reference.html#locators
2011-07-15T10:28:32  <whitecat> Sweet thanks
2011-07-15T10:28:48  <whitecat> I can use the idname of the link.

2011-07-15T10:29:54  <RossPatterson> Yeah, id=whatever is actually one of the most reliable and fastest locators.
2011-07-15T10:30:01  <RossPatterson> DOH!
2011-07-15T10:30:32  <RossPatterson> Still, lots of other options.  *Worst* case, you can code an xpath= locator that identifies the link by its surrounding HTML.

2011-07-15T11:08:32  <ruel> 450 functional tests to be migrated to webdriver
2011-07-15T11:08:37  <ruel> from your experience
2011-07-15T11:08:50  <ruel> should i bit the bullet and convert to the webdrive api format
2011-07-15T11:08:55  <ruel> or try the webdrivebackedselenium?
2011-07-15T11:09:28  <ruel> my concern is that the webdriverbacked selenium functionality might be ..odd.. thoughts?
2011-07-15T11:10:27  <gogo`> ruel: how much time do you think it would take to convert your 450 to se2
2011-07-15T11:10:45  <ruel> i use the pageobjects pattern
2011-07-15T11:10:51  <ruel> so it shouldn't be TOO horrid
2011-07-15T11:10:57  <gogo`> ruel: if its a couple of days, go for it
2011-07-15T11:11:32  <gogo`> ruel: if its a month, then i would suggest moving all to webdriverbacked se, and then converting individually
2011-07-15T11:11:36  <AutomatedTester> ruel: if you have an abstraction do it in one go
2011-07-15T11:11:49  <ruel> thats sort of what i as inclined to think as well
2011-07-15T11:12:46  <ruel> so 2 questions based on that
2011-07-15T11:12:51  <AutomatedTester> if you didnt have an abstraction do webdriverbackedselenium
2011-07-15T11:12:59  <ruel> i used to use css:contains
2011-07-15T11:13:20  <ruel> all over the place.....from what i'm reading, i'm pretty much out of luck on that
2011-07-15T11:14:25  <ruel> do you guys just revert to the xpath equivalent in that case?

2011-07-15T11:35:31  <Samit> whitecat: Once you get started with IDE, it is probably best to move to WebDriver
2011-07-15T11:35:32  *** Mayank1 has joined #selenium
2011-07-15T11:35:42  <RossPatterson> Then the question would arise of whether you're better off changing to RC or WebDriver.
2011-07-15T11:36:16  <RossPatterson> Some of us users are still riding the RC bandwagon, while most (all?) of the developers are advocating for WebDriver.

2011-07-15T12:40:37  <elew> why do you need it to be an xpath?
2011-07-15T12:41:11  <autojack> because the element doesn't have an id or name attached to it.
2011-07-15T12:41:19  <autojack> but actually it looks like that syntax is correct.
2011-07-15T12:41:29  <autojack> it's working on other things.
2011-07-15T12:41:43  <autojack> so I guess that isn't my problem. hmmm.
2011-07-15T12:42:21  <autojack> I just need to wait for that spinner to go away, but I have another idea for something I can wait on.
2011-07-15T12:42:22  <elew> you could try it with css
2011-07-15T12:42:52  <autojack> nah, I see that's not the problem.
2011-07-15T12:44:25  <autojack> I think I see why it didn't work. I was calling .displayed? on it, and it wasn't changing from displayed to hidden; it was just being removed from the HTML completely.
2011-07-15T12:48:30  <jarib> daviddpark: i've beeen asking myself that question
2011-07-15T12:49:41  <jarib> daviddpark: ah, looks like there's a command line switch for this
2011-07-15T12:50:46  <daviddpark> jarib: I am on the edge of my seat in suspense. I can't find it...
2011-07-15T12:51:50  <jarib> --disable-popup-blocking

2011-07-15T12:55:25  <daviddpark> jarib: are you using Java to write your tests?
2011-07-15T12:55:40  <jarib> usually not
2011-07-15T12:55:43  <jarib> why?
2011-07-15T12:56:23  <daviddpark> Just curious.... googling for selenium AND "--disable-popup-blocking" results in java stuff...
2011-07-15T12:56:35  <daviddpark> usually not, so then... ruby or python?
2011-07-15T12:56:50  <jarib> ruby
2011-07-15T12:56:55  <daviddpark> k
2011-07-15T12:57:20  <jarib> passing switches to chrome is a quite new feature though
2011-07-15T12:57:26  <jarib> probably not too many hits for that atm
2011-07-15T12:58:08  <jarib> looks like popups are always allowed from localhost
2011-07-15T12:58:28  <jarib> or file:// and data:
2011-07-15T12:58:37  <jarib> so i'm having a hard time trying it out
2011-07-15T12:58:49  <jarib> let's see.
2011-07-15T12:59:36  <daviddpark> Would you mind providing me with a snippet at how you are passing that in to a custom launcher?
2011-07-15T12:59:50  <jarib> in ruby?
2011-07-15T12:59:58  <daviddpark> sure, that'll work.
2011-07-15T13:00:02  <jarib> heh
2011-07-15T13:00:05  <jarib> what language are you using?
2011-07-15T13:00:23  <daviddpark> my team is using python, but I am versed in java and ruby
2011-07-15T13:00:44  <jarib> you want to pass "chrome.switches" => ["--disable-popup-blocking"] as part of the desired capabilities
2011-07-15T13:01:12  <jarib> in ruby it's exposed as Selenium::WebDriver.for :chrome, :switches => ["--disable-popup-blocking"]
2011-07-15T13:01:42  <jarib> i seem unable to make chrome *block* popup windows though, so can't really try it out
2011-07-15T13:01:55  *** andreashaas has left #selenium
2011-07-15T13:02:17  <jarib> it looks valid though: http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch#OAMlx_jo-ck/src/content/common/content_switches.cc&exact_package=chromium&q=disable-popup-blocking&type=cs&l=121
2011-07-15T13:02:31  <daviddpark> heh... I have been using saucelabs on demand service, which spins up an ami with a virgin chrome with each test.
2011-07-15T13:03:08  <daviddpark> cool.... let me see what I can do with it. thanks for the pointer.

2011-07-15T14:00:28  *** boily has quit IRC
2011-07-15T14:00:37  <ieamcam> i'm having an issue where selenium throws an exception with a message of Permission denied
2011-07-15T14:00:53  <ieamcam> seems to be an issue with the same origin policy in Selenium RC
2011-07-15T14:00:58  <antlong> ieamcam did you say open sesame
2011-07-15T14:01:01  <ieamcam> how the heck does one get around that?
2011-07-15T14:01:27  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-07-15T14:01:47  <ieamcam> errr
2011-07-15T14:01:49  <jimevans> ieamcam: I'd love to help, but I'm (intentionally) ignorant when it comes to using the Selenium RC API, and Selenium Core in particular.
2011-07-15T14:01:50  <ieamcam> open sesame
2011-07-15T14:01:59  <ieamcam> oh blast
2011-07-15T14:02:07  <ieamcam> so you are using the webdriver?
2011-07-15T14:02:10  <jimevans> I am.
2011-07-15T14:02:21  <ieamcam> i found that the webdriver works very well for firefox
2011-07-15T14:02:27  <ieamcam> but almost completely useless for IE
2011-07-15T14:02:35  <ieamcam> in fact correction, it is completely useless for ie
2011-07-15T14:02:47  <jimevans> I see. How so?
2011-07-15T14:03:02  <ieamcam> i couldn't do basic things, such as clicking dom elements
2011-07-15T14:03:10  <ieamcam> i was having issues with xpath etc
2011-07-15T14:03:20  <ieamcam> so i finally started adding IDs to elements i needed access to
2011-07-15T14:03:26  <ieamcam> i still had issues
2011-07-15T14:03:31  <jimevans> A good idea anyway, to be sure.
2011-07-15T14:03:43  <ieamcam> it was extremely odd
2011-07-15T14:03:59  <jimevans> does your site use frames?
2011-07-15T14:04:05  <ieamcam> i basically said screw it, and decided to use the DefaultSelenium class which works flawlessly
2011-07-15T14:04:06  <ieamcam> nope
2011-07-15T14:04:14  <ieamcam> it was literally a few links at the top of a page
2011-07-15T14:04:18  <jimevans> okay, that's a plus.
2011-07-15T14:04:27  <ieamcam> in fact the links were almost identical
2011-07-15T14:04:41  <antlong> ieamcam is your test site public
2011-07-15T14:04:46  <ieamcam> no
2011-07-15T14:04:55  <antlong> ieamcam can you reproduce this on a public site
2011-07-15T14:05:04  *** Mayank has joined #selenium
2011-07-15T14:05:14  <ieamcam> i dont know, i never tried
2011-07-15T14:05:24  <jimevans> i've been using the IE driver for a long time now, and haven't had any issues.
2011-07-15T14:05:26  <ieamcam> i wasn't doing anything special
2011-07-15T14:05:41  <antlong> ieamcam what version of ie
2011-07-15T14:05:50  <ieamcam> i believe it was 8
2011-07-15T14:05:51  <jimevans> considering that I wrote most of the IE driver, to hear that it's "useless" is disconcerting, and a little insulting.
2011-07-15T14:06:02  <ieamcam> oh ouch
2011-07-15T14:06:09  <ieamcam> my bad
2011-07-15T14:06:20  <antlong> jimevans dont take it personally :P
2011-07-15T14:06:20  <ieamcam> just frustration is all
2011-07-15T14:06:46  <jimevans> I get frustration entirely. If you think using the IE driver is frustrating, you should try creating it.
2011-07-15T14:06:58  <ruel> touche
2011-07-15T14:07:00  <jimevans> IE doesn't make it easy
2011-07-15T14:07:02  <ieamcam> yup
2011-07-15T14:07:14  <ieamcam> i wouldn't even bother
2011-07-15T14:07:18  <ruel> no doubt about it, IE isn't as friendly to us devs
2011-07-15T14:07:20  <ruel> on that noe
2011-07-15T14:07:21  <ruel> note
2011-07-15T14:07:28  <ruel> a quick question regarding the IE driver
2011-07-15T14:07:33  <jimevans> but, I have a solution that works very well in most cases, and I'd really like to know why it's not working for you.
2011-07-15T14:07:38  <jimevans> ruel: go ahead.
2011-07-15T14:07:48  <ruel> I have a test which selects an element form a list.    That triggers a javascript refresh of the page
2011-07-15T14:08:06  <jimevans> ok
2011-07-15T14:08:17  <ruel> I have a wait function which then waits on an error div showing up
2011-07-15T14:08:20  <jimevans> ok
2011-07-15T14:08:25  <ruel> Sporadically
2011-07-15T14:08:27  *** Mayank1 has quit IRC
2011-07-15T14:08:28  <ruel> the test fails with a
2011-07-15T14:08:57  <antlong> ieamcam so anyway, you get permission denied when clicking links?
2011-07-15T14:08:57  <ruel> Javascript error (Warning:  Server didn't provide any stacktrace)
2011-07-15T14:09:13  <ruel> 1)   is there a way to throttle the speed....i assume this is just a timing issue
2011-07-15T14:09:46  <ruel> or rather, is there some sort of waitForPageToLoad (*shudder*) equivalent
2011-07-15T14:09:48  <ruel> i should be using
2011-07-15T14:10:15  <jimevans> ruel: can you paste up your code so I can have a look?
2011-07-15T14:10:17  <ieamcam> yes using the DefaultSelenium class i'm having an issue with permission denied
2011-07-15T14:10:17  <jimevans> :gist
2011-07-15T14:10:17  <selbot2> Please paste >3 lines of text to http://gist.github.com
2011-07-15T14:10:27  <ruel> sure
2011-07-15T14:10:30  <ieamcam> and i think it's because im transitioning from 1 domaint to another
2011-07-15T14:10:46  <antlong> jimevans, is that due to the pac file being accessed too quickly?
2011-07-15T14:11:17  <ieamcam> im using the cybervillains certificate, with the -trustAllSSLCertificates option
2011-07-15T14:11:29  <ieamcam> and i do believe i'm using the *iexploreproxy
2011-07-15T14:11:44  <ieamcam> as opposed to just *iexplore , which didn't seem to work for me
2011-07-15T14:11:55  <ieamcam> however, i read that iexploreproxy does have some issues
2011-07-15T14:11:59  <ieamcam> being not that reliable
2011-07-15T14:12:03  <jimevans> antlong: i'm sorry? if we're using Selenium Core, I've no idea. Again, that's intentional. I hate the Selenium RC API, and have refused to use it.
2011-07-15T14:12:06  <antlong> ieamcam what OS are you on
2011-07-15T14:12:15  <ieamcam> lol
2011-07-15T14:12:18  <ieamcam> windows 7
2011-07-15T14:12:31  <ieamcam> i hate the api in PHP
2011-07-15T14:12:35  <ieamcam> thus i switched to java
2011-07-15T14:12:40  <antlong> jimevans theres an issue like this that is caused by the .pac (protected access zones or something) being accessed before a site is added to it
2011-07-15T14:13:01  <ieamcam> and it's ie 8
2011-07-15T14:13:07  <jimevans> antlong: I'll take your word for it.
2011-07-15T14:13:27  <jimevans> I'm still stuck on why a simple element click didn't work.

2011-07-15T14:16:50  <ieamcam> no i wasn't able to get that far with webdriver
