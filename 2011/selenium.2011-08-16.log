2011-08-16T03:10:41  <gucki> selenium 2.4.0 has this change "Raise in switch_to.alert when no alert is present."
2011-08-16T03:11:20  <gucki> before I could simply do "page.driver.browser.switch_to.alert.text" and if it was != null there was an alert present
2011-08-16T03:11:32  <gucki> how can I check with 2.4.0 for the presence of an alert?

2011-08-16T04:41:59  <Binken_> Hello
2011-08-16T04:59:23  <gucki> jarib: exceptions are "exceptions". so see wether there's an alert, i should not need to check for an exception but have a method like alert_present?
2011-08-16T05:02:11  <gucki> jarib: doing a search on google on "exceptions for control flow" returns lots of example on why not use it for that
2011-08-16T05:02:12  <gucki> Generally exceptions are expensive operations and as the name would suggest, exceptional conditions. So using them in the context of controlling the flow of your application is indeed considered bad practice.

2011-08-16T05:48:30  <cgoldberg> gucki, basically python prefers EAFP style programming rather than LBYL
2011-08-16T05:48:36  <gucki> cgoldberg: yeah i saw this (I'll read it in more detail later), but if pyhton is the exception...why make all other languages behave like it?

2011-08-16T06:05:58  <speciaal> its strange, the alert window appears, but the webdriver does not see it. As i read, the alert should not be visible when using webdriver.

2011-08-16T06:07:42  <Adamantus> Hi. I need to assert that an id or class is present but can't figure it out. It's not text and it's not an element/tag.

2011-08-16T06:10:56  <jimevans> Adamantus: and element.getAttribute("class") doesn't work for you?

2011-08-16T06:55:43  <urbanfbi> hi, I've updated my firefox version to version 6. Now selenium2 fails to open a page: NotConnectedException: Unable to connect to host 127.0.0.1 on port 7055 after 45000 ms
2011-08-16T06:55:50  <urbanfbi> how do I fix that?

2011-08-16T07:04:27  <eranm> Good

2011-08-16T07:04:34  <urbanfbi> I've updated selenium. It works perfectly ... thanks a lot!

2011-08-16T07:40:02  <Jaimie> is there a way i can do browser based authentication now that firefox and IE have removed the optional RFC standard for user:password@hostname.tld?
2011-08-16T07:40:13  <barancev> lots of them are duplicates, lots of them have patches included. that's why I asked -- are there some releases in the plan dedicated to the issue tracker cleaning?
2011-08-16T07:40:17  <Jaimie> and I guess chrome isnt too far behind

2011-08-16T09:30:21  *** jimevans has joined #selenium
2011-08-16T09:30:32  <ChrisCulver> i'll check into autoi
2011-08-16T09:30:35  <ChrisCulver> *autit
2011-08-16T09:30:41  <ChrisCulver> or find a .net alternative
2011-08-16T09:30:47  <ChrisCulver> they are windows automations right?
2011-08-16T09:31:37  <lukeis> autoit is windows i believe yes... i thankfully don't have to use them for my site
2011-08-16T09:31:52  <ChrisCulver> new project is using ad authentication
2011-08-16T09:33:55  <lukeis> sounds strange...  you should tell the dev's that basic auth and those dialogs are probably the least secure way of handling authentication... since browsers send that info with every request and if one url is not https... then the packet has your password over the wire in plain text
2011-08-16T09:34:16  <ChrisCulver> not external
2011-08-16T09:34:25  <lukeis> then why authenticate it :)
2011-08-16T09:34:40  <ChrisCulver> user security within the app is set by ad username
2011-08-16T09:34:46  <ChrisCulver> auto logs the current ad user into the app
2011-08-16T09:34:57  <ChrisCulver> but i need to test other users

2011-08-16T09:58:02  <lukeis> email_temp_nick: you don't have the jar in your path? or you're not running on windows? or you have multiple versions of selenium on your classpath?

2011-08-16T10:59:27  <BenGrailsGuy> Am I missing something here?
2011-08-16T10:59:35  <BenGrailsGuy> I pass this binary to the firefox driver

2011-08-16T11:00:07  <lukeis> and i'm not sure that's how one would / should do it... have to look it up
2011-08-16T11:00:15  <BenGrailsGuy> but
2011-08-16T11:00:36  <BenGrailsGuy> see i've got to start xvfb manually from code
2011-08-16T11:01:10  <lukeis> manually from the code.... hmmm
2011-08-16T11:01:26  <lukeis> you doing it manually? or is the code doing it? :)

2011-08-16T11:01:42  <lukeis> ok
2011-08-16T11:02:08  <BenGrailsGuy> the code does it
2011-08-16T11:02:47  <BenGrailsGuy> and I really dont know how. it's someone else's code, I havent found where it is... All I know is xvfb runs
2011-08-16T11:02:50  <lukeis> how are you runining your tests
2011-08-16T11:03:20  <BenGrailsGuy> well basicly I have a groovy script that starts the server, then looks for tests, runs them, then stops the server
2011-08-16T11:03:39  <BenGrailsGuy> its a tomcat server that runs grails app packed into a WAR
2011-08-16T11:04:12  <lukeis> ok... i think when you call your tests in the groovy script is where you're supposed to designate the X display
2011-08-16T11:04:34  * lukeis has someone else who sets this stuff up on his build servers...

2011-08-16T14:51:46  <Mayank> Hi all, I have a page that contains elements with text like - API Test 1, API Test 2, API Test 3. These elements are clickable. According to the testing constraints, the id of the element is not directly available thus - I am using this - driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[contains(.,'"+Name+"')]")); to find element. But, the xpath found is always of the wrong element and on .click(); the page does not change and remains the same. Browser: IE, Selenium 2.
2011-08-16T14:52:08  <stephenjudkins> is there a way, in any browser, to fake hostnames? something like dynamically changing /etc/hosts, but for the selenium browser only?

2011-08-16T15:34:55  <lukeis> getting an element and then navigating to another page and looking up an element with the same id will cause a stale element exception

2011-08-16T17:18:02  <simonstewart> dawagner: no matter how we define when "get" ends, that test should still pass
2011-08-16T17:18:06  <simonstewart> Binken_: hi
2011-08-16T17:18:35  <Binken_> :-d Simon, I forget the debug server's default url
2011-08-16T17:18:41  <simonstewart> localhost:2310/
2011-08-16T17:19:38  <dawagner> The following fix the test: 1) Adding a 10ms sleep before the last findElement, or 2) removing the onload from the first page.
2011-08-16T17:20:09  <simonstewart> So there's an actual bug to fix there
2011-08-16T17:20:18  <Binken_> bot.action.click_(element, bot.Mouse.Button.LEFT, opt_coords);  is this the atoms click?
2011-08-16T17:20:23  <simonstewart> The onload on the first page deliberately fails to close the javascript operation
2011-08-16T17:20:32  <simonstewart> Binken_: yes
2011-08-16T17:20:51  <simonstewart> And that shouldn't cause chaos elsewhere
2011-08-16T17:21:17  <dawagner> Close the operation?
2011-08-16T17:21:33  <simonstewart> The document.write is left hanging (from memory)
2011-08-16T17:21:52  <simonstewart> there should be a matching call to say that we've finished attempting to append to the body
2011-08-16T17:21:57  <simonstewart> but there isn't
2011-08-16T17:22:04  <dawagner> aha
2011-08-16T17:22:09  <simonstewart> (that was an actual reported bug: the fix is not to add the missing call)
2011-08-16T17:23:17  <dawagner> Any idea what interaction could be causing that test to fail then? ^^
2011-08-16T17:23:22  <simonstewart> Nope
2011-08-16T17:23:34  <simonstewart> But just deleting it isn't the right way to fix it
2011-08-16T17:26:40  <simonstewart> Shit
2011-08-16T17:27:01  <dawagner> Shit?

2011-08-16T17:27:43  <simonstewart> I thought that a test might be failing because of a Real Problem
2011-08-16T17:27:51  <dawagner> Surely not!?

2011-08-16T19:50:11  <doc_tuna> yeah it may be that ff5 doesn't work with it, i don't know the status on that
2011-08-16T19:52:54  <doc_tuna> mydog2: are you using the selenium 2.4 jars?
2011-08-16T19:53:38  <doc_tuna> should work from what i'm reading
2011-08-16T19:54:49  <doc_tuna> no offense but your code is quite a mess mydog
2011-08-16T19:54:57  <doc_tuna> or at least in that fpaste it looks messy
2011-08-16T19:59:02  <mydog2> hey doc_tuna - it appears from the file names.. the selenium is 2.0b
2011-08-16T19:59:18  <doc_tuna> please go download 2.40
2011-08-16T19:59:38  <doc_tuna> it should work for you
2011-08-16T19:59:40  <mydog2> i would.. if i could figure out where they are..
