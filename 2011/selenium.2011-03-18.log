2011-03-18T05:53:58  <AutomatedTester> fancy a world where the python bindings never throw an alert when starting Firefox?
2011-03-18T05:54:18  <davehunt> I dream of that world
2011-03-18T05:54:20  <AutomatedTester> that world is here...
2011-03-18T05:54:46  <davehunt> That's great news
2011-03-18T05:55:07  <AutomatedTester> i now need to clean up the code, little refactoring...
2011-03-18T05:55:11  <davehunt> Is it released? Can I use it on Wednesday?
2011-03-18T05:55:12  <AutomatedTester> and I will commit
2011-03-18T05:55:28  <AutomatedTester> davehunt: hopefully by the end of today it will be in trunk
2011-03-18T05:55:43  <davehunt> Cool
2011-03-18T05:55:57  <AutomatedTester> so at worst you will have to use the trunk version
2011-03-18T05:56:04  <AutomatedTester> but all my tests are passing so I am happy
2011-03-18T05:56:38  <davehunt> If I don't have time I'll just use Firefox 3.6, I doubt I'll be doing any live demos of the tests anyway
2011-03-18T05:57:08  <davehunt> Definitely 4.0 by Selenium Conference though :)
2011-03-18T05:57:33  <AutomatedTester> well I want this ready for 2.0b3
2011-03-18T05:57:41  <AutomatedTester> and definitely want it in place by wednesday
2011-03-18T05:57:49  <AutomatedTester> i might release early
2011-03-18T05:59:01  <AutomatedTester> but need to go to the post office now

2011-03-18T06:18:26  <davehunt> oops, I meant to address that to jimevans
2011-03-18T06:18:34  <davehunt> I think I need more coffee. :)

2011-03-18T06:22:01  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: the python bindings werent working well with Firefox 4
2011-03-18T06:22:11  <AutomatedTester> and since the code was a mess
2011-03-18T06:22:15  <AutomatedTester> I rewrote it
2011-03-18T06:22:21  <AutomatedTester> cherry picking the good parts
2011-03-18T06:22:42  <jimevans> well done, mate. good on you.
2011-03-18T06:23:57  <AutomatedTester> but it means when I do my next big refactor I can do it quite confidently
2011-03-18T06:25:28  <AutomatedTester> but the biggest issue was the old code fubared user.js
2011-03-18T06:28:53  *** m1k3y has quit IRC
2011-03-18T06:29:04  <AutomatedTester> but this has made me wish we had a DVCS in use
2011-03-18T06:31:01  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: you doing a nuget package?
2011-03-18T06:31:08  <jimevans> eventually.
2011-03-18T06:31:30  <jimevans> i'm ambivalent about package managers.
2011-03-18T06:31:31  * AutomatedTester heard...and this is just rumour, that if you do a nuget package you cant change your API
2011-03-18T06:31:46  <AutomatedTester> which seems odd to me
2011-03-18T06:32:06  <jimevans> i can't imagine that would be the case; i'll look into it more before committing.
2011-03-18T06:32:32  <AutomatedTester> heard someone say something like that at a .NET user group I go to
2011-03-18T06:32:47  <AutomatedTester> but I havent looked into it so could be way wrong
2011-03-18T06:33:22  <jimevans> just one look at the hue and cry raised when the latest java public release doesn't get pushed to a maven repository *within 5 effing minutes of being released* makes me reluctant to go down that road
2011-03-18T06:34:01  <AutomatedTester> +1 to that

2011-03-18T07:20:11  <jimevans> that's what i usually do.
2011-03-18T07:20:38  <jimevans> though there may be more specific targets you can use to build just the pieces you need.

2011-03-18T07:33:50  <AutomatedTester> aikie: click()?
2011-03-18T07:34:41  <aikie> but then you have to check every time before clicking()
2011-03-18T07:35:01  <aikie> too bad there isn't something like setSelected(false)
2011-03-18T07:35:28  <AutomatedTester> aikie: Selenium is an extendable framework...
2011-03-18T07:35:30  <RossPatterson> aikie: Selenium 1 or 2?
2011-03-18T07:35:35  <aikie> 2
2011-03-18T07:36:33  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: have you seen a way to get around the firstrun in Firefox?
2011-03-18T07:36:45  * AutomatedTester knows the irony in the question
2011-03-18T07:36:55  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: no, but then again, i haven't tried. :)
2011-03-18T07:37:11  <ato> jimevans: That didn't create the webdriver extension that I was looking for…
2011-03-18T07:37:27  <AutomatedTester> ato: its one of the javascript build commands
2011-03-18T07:37:29  <jimevans> I always manually perform the first run manually.
2011-03-18T07:37:43  <AutomatedTester> ato : ./go -T
2011-03-18T07:37:52  <ato> AutomatedTester: I'm not familiar with this at all, could you… Thank you!
2011-03-18T07:38:25  <jimevans> ato: the firefox target must build the extension somehow. in your build directory, you proabably have webdriver.xpi somewhere in one of the subdirectories.

2011-03-18T07:38:53  <lawcab> i am having some problems
2011-03-18T07:38:57  <AutomatedTester> aikie: imminent
2011-03-18T07:39:26  <AutomatedTester> we are trying to iron out a few crinkles

2011-03-18T07:39:53  <lawcab> with a RemoteWebDriver.findelement(By.xpath)
2011-03-18T07:39:57  <aikie> good to know :-)
2011-03-18T07:40:05  <lawcab> in one test data it works
2011-03-18T07:40:14  <lawcab> then with another set of data it can not work
2011-03-18T07:40:26  <lawcab> but if i try to find the xpath
2011-03-18T07:40:32  <lawcab> iusing the browser
2011-03-18T07:40:35  <AutomatedTester> lawcab: is the xpath valid?
2011-03-18T07:40:37  <lawcab> it can find it
2011-03-18T07:40:40  <lawcab> yes
2011-03-18T07:41:03  <lawcab> "//input[contains(@value, '1')]"
2011-03-18T07:41:06  <aikie> probably you're trying to find an element while the page is not yet fully loaded

2011-03-18T07:43:14  <ato> jimevans, AutomatedTester: Works now, though.  Cheers.
2011-03-18T07:43:41  <lawcab> I do have a sleep 1000
2011-03-18T07:44:11  <jimevans> lawcab: what browser exhibits the problem?
2011-03-18T07:44:18  <lawcab> firefox
2011-03-18T07:44:26  <lawcab> line of code is : driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[contains(@value, '1')]")).setSelected();
2011-03-18T07:45:42  <aikie> what you can try as well is to get the page source with getPageSource(), save it to disk and test your xpath on the file created.

2011-03-18T07:47:13  <antlong> awesome AutomatedTester! thats great news
2011-03-18T07:47:30  <AutomatedTester> i "rewrote" them
2011-03-18T07:47:41  <AutomatedTester> cherry picking the good parts and rewriting the bad parts
2011-03-18T07:47:42  <antlong> very close to being able to switch to se2 now
2011-03-18T07:47:57  <jimevans> lawcab: are you sure the input element you're looking for is the only one with a value containing '1'?
2011-03-18T07:48:01  <antlong> AutomatedTester, im going to fix that docstring on implicitly_wait, then move on to the other drivers
2011-03-18T07:48:21  <AutomatedTester> antlong: tbh, the only one to do is IE
2011-03-18T07:48:28  <AutomatedTester> the new firefox code isnt committed yet
2011-03-18T07:48:33  <jimevans> lawcab: be aware that a value attribute containing '10' will also be returned by the xpath expression you've supplied.
2011-03-18T07:48:35  <lawcab> yes
2011-03-18T07:48:39  <AutomatedTester> and the ChromeDriver will be rewritten soon too
2011-03-18T07:48:43  <antlong> will do  :)
2011-03-18T07:49:02  <antlong> AutomatedTester, oh also, gotta give you props, i tried htmlunit for the first time and it worked quite well

2011-03-18T07:49:21  <lawcab> I use the xpath checker in firefox to verify my xpath expression
2011-03-18T07:49:30  <lawcab> and it only returns one radio button
2011-03-18T07:49:39  <AutomatedTester> well it appears to work...
2011-03-18T07:50:11  <antlong> AutomatedTester, thats generally much more reassuring than not appearing to work, heh

2011-03-18T07:50:42  <AutomatedTester> and in theory the android driver too
2011-03-18T07:50:48  <AutomatedTester> but havent tested it
2011-03-18T07:50:59  <aikie> maybe there's a see-through div over your radiobutton?
2011-03-18T07:51:18  <jimevans> lawcab: without seeing the html page that is giving you problems, i'm not going to be much more help.
2011-03-18T07:51:35  <lawcab> right
2011-03-18T07:51:43  <lawcab> can I forward you the html\
2011-03-18T07:52:08  <jimevans> if you want to gist it, i'd be willing to take a further look.
2011-03-18T07:52:11  <lawcab> or is there a better way to find using xpath
2011-03-18T07:53:24  <jimevans> lawcab: successful locating via xpath is very specific to the page you're testing against. it's hard to give one-size-fits-all advice on the matter.

2011-03-18T07:54:21  <lawcab> jimevans: Thanks. I will try something out first
2011-03-18T07:54:29  <simonstewart> Hi everyone
2011-03-18T07:54:34  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: going to be around for a bit?
2011-03-18T07:54:39  <jimevans> g'day simonstewart!
2011-03-18T07:54:39  <lawcab> jimevans: then will bug you again later on
2011-03-18T07:54:42  <simonstewart> A couple of hours
2011-03-18T07:54:43  <AutomatedTester> hi btw
2011-03-18T07:54:55  <jimevans> lawcab: if i'm around, i'll be glad to look at it.
2011-03-18T07:54:56  <AutomatedTester> cool, doing an interview now and then wanna ask you a couple questions :)
2011-03-18T07:56:08  <simonstewart> k
2011-03-18T07:56:22  <simonstewart> BTW, anyone want to help me push Firefox 4 support "over the top"?
2011-03-18T07:56:26  <simonstewart> It's soooo close
2011-03-18T07:56:28  *** mandric has joined #selenium
2011-03-18T07:56:59  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: I have fixed the FirefoxDriver for python
2011-03-18T07:57:04  <AutomatedTester> <- very excited
2011-03-18T07:57:05  <lawcab> jimevans: here is the html behind the radio button
2011-03-18T07:57:06  <simonstewart> Cool.
2011-03-18T07:57:11  <simonstewart> The core tests are failing right now

2011-03-18T07:57:30  <simonstewart> Once those pass, there's one failing webdriver test
2011-03-18T07:57:34  <lawcab> <input type="radio" value="1" name="processoption66945852">
2011-03-18T07:57:45  <simonstewart> and i have no idea how test-ie-core runs with ie9
2011-03-18T07:57:50  <lawcab> there are 5 radio buttons
2011-03-18T07:57:58  <simonstewart> Once those look green, we'll go for it
2011-03-18T07:58:00  <lawcab> the others have the same name but different values
2011-03-18T07:58:04  <lawcab> 2, 3, 4 and 5
2011-03-18T07:59:27  <jimevans> simonstewart: is there a similar "test-ie-core" target?
2011-03-18T07:59:36  <simonstewart> Right on the money :)
2011-03-18T08:00:07  <jimevans> because i get "Don't know how to build task 'test-ie-core'" :)

2011-03-18T08:05:14  *** andytinkham has joined #selenium
2011-03-18T08:08:45  <jimevans> simonstewart: i'm showing 8 failures under ie9.
2011-03-18T08:09:05  <simonstewart> I think that's consistent with ie8
2011-03-18T08:09:28  <jimevans> i'm double-checking against ie8 now to be certain.
2011-03-18T08:10:15  <simonstewart> I knew you'd be thorough
2011-03-18T08:10:38  <simonstewart> BTW, since my my win7 dev machine appears to be hosed, how are you doing the testing on multiple browsers?
2011-03-18T08:10:43  <simonstewart> Using MS's machine images?
2011-03-18T08:11:03  <simonstewart> And just copying everything once it's built to the machine?
2011-03-18T08:11:39  *** skiphuffman_ has joined #selenium
2011-03-18T08:12:42  <jimevans> i've got two test machines at my desk, one running win7x64 with IE9, one running Win2k3x86 with IE8.
2011-03-18T08:13:00  <jimevans> for ie6 and 7, i'm using the MS compatibility VM images.
2011-03-18T08:13:20  <simonstewart> Makes sense
2011-03-18T08:13:44  <simonstewart> Oh well. Once more into the fray with Firefox 4
2011-03-18T08:13:46  <jimevans> if I have to test a code change before checkin, it's a bit of a pain because i do have to copy changed source.
2011-03-18T08:13:53  <simonstewart> *grumble, grumble, grumble*
2011-03-18T08:14:00  <simonstewart> ugh
2011-03-18T08:14:24  <jimevans> but most code changes, don't have to be that rigorous.
2011-03-18T08:14:24  <simonstewart> I'm having a poke around here to see if we can get a reliable continuous build set up
2011-03-18T08:15:11  <simonstewart> Agreed.
2011-03-18T08:15:11  * jimevans realizes actually having python installed and on the path *vastly* reduces atom compile time
2011-03-18T08:15:22  <simonstewart> Though I'd love a rock solid CI system
2011-03-18T08:16:35  <jimevans> me too. found an oddness in the drag-drop tests that use jquery in ie. if your mouse pointer is over the browser, and the browser is in the foreground, the test is likely to fail.
2011-03-18T08:16:53  <simonstewart> Ouch
2011-03-18T08:16:59  <simonstewart> Does watin suffer from that?
2011-03-18T08:17:06  <simonstewart> Or watir for that matter
2011-03-18T08:18:20  <jimevans> no idea.

2011-03-18T08:19:08  <jimevans> thought i'd remembered spotting that one.

2011-03-18T08:28:12  <simonstewart> That's pretty good, considering that there have been no changes for IE 9
2011-03-18T08:28:44  <jimevans> and it's possible the problem is a dojo problem (older versions of jquery break on ie9 too)
2011-03-18T08:29:01  <simonstewart> Then I'm going to be relaxed
2011-03-18T08:29:02  <AutomatedTester> back

2011-03-18T08:33:26  <jimevans> my pleasure. post-b3, i'm going to check in the ie-optimized atom header, and start really cleaning up the native code.
2011-03-18T08:33:39  <simonstewart> There's no stopping you :)
2011-03-18T08:33:41  <jimevans> style-wise that is.

2011-03-18T10:25:34  <simonstewart> any ideas why?
2011-03-18T10:26:22  <semperos> how does one determine a browser window's "name"? I see this: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html#moving-between-windows-and-frames , but I'm not able to switch between windows by anything I would think of as a name

2011-03-18T10:39:47  <simonstewart> ?
2011-03-18T10:40:00  <AutomatedTester> are the core tests running in Firefox and the RC tests running in the browser chrome?
2011-03-18T10:40:27  <simonstewart> I just flipped the browser string

2011-03-18T10:41:38  <AutomatedTester> i think *firefox reverts to *chrome in RC but that might have changed
2011-03-18T10:41:43  <simonstewart> No, it does
2011-03-18T10:41:53  <simonstewart> Has done for a long time
2011-03-18T10:43:39  <simonstewart> I guess it must be the launching code, somehow
2011-03-18T10:44:34  <simonstewart> Double checking: it's definitely using the FirefoxChromeLauncher

2011-03-18T11:50:57  <mister_m> is there a way I can get a locator string to the element that contains a certain bit of text with only having the text?
2011-03-18T11:52:35  <andytinkham> mister_m: You could use XPath, with the contains function
2011-03-18T11:53:22  <mister_m> andytinkham: I'll try something like that. I am not great at xpath
2011-03-18T11:54:39  <andytinkham> Should be something like //*[contains(., "your text here")] or some variant of that (that will give you the immediate element that has the text. For some of my buttons, though, the button contains a span which has the text. This would give me the span, not the button. YMMV)
2011-03-18T11:54:44  <RossPatterson> mister_m: If you're having trouble writing XPath locators, you should try one of the Firefox extensions that help you out.  I like XPath Checker - it's clean and simple.
2011-03-18T11:55:17  <semperos> you can use Firebug's console and execute xpath as well
2011-03-18T11:55:24  <mister_m> ok thanks guys
2011-03-18T11:55:26  <semperos> $x('//xpath-query-here');
2011-03-18T11:57:27  <RossPatterson> Yeah, Firebug's a cool tool, but it's kinda heavyweight if all you want is XPath help.
2011-03-18T11:58:06  <semperos> true, though I'd assume most folks who do web dev/testing would use it for lots of things

2011-03-18T12:13:30  <ken_wienecke> Is there a way for Selenium to test whether a specific HTML element has a certain class in its class list?
2011-03-18T12:13:36  *** csanchez has joined #selenium
2011-03-18T12:13:55  <RossPatterson> Yes.  Selenium 1 or 2?
2011-03-18T12:17:50  <RossPatterson> I'd suggest IsElementPresent(...) with an XPath or CSS locator that includes the class.  For example, "css=div#id_of_element.expected_class_name".
2011-03-18T12:18:24  *** darrenm_ has quit IRC
2011-03-18T12:19:20  <ken_wienecke> I'm a Selenium newby, so I need to ask how to know what version of Selenium I'm using.  I just installed it in January 2011 and and just now getting in to using it seriously.
2011-03-18T12:19:37  <ken_wienecke> I just read about locators, but I haven't actually used one yet.
2011-03-18T12:19:55  <RossPatterson> No problem.  You're probably using the Selenium IDE then.
2011-03-18T12:20:01  <ken_wienecke> Yes
2011-03-18T12:20:59  <ken_wienecke> So IsElementPresent() with the XPath or CSS locator would return FALSE if the element existed but didn't have the specified class.
2011-03-18T12:21:12  *** mister_m has joined #selenium
2011-03-18T12:21:20  <RossPatterson> So you want to use the "verifyElementPresent" command.
2011-03-18T12:21:24  *** andialbrecht_ is now known as andialbrecht
2011-03-18T12:21:26  <mister_m> is it possible to grab text that has been entered inside of a textbox?
2011-03-18T12:21:28  *** cburroughs has quit IRC
2011-03-18T12:21:35  <RossPatterson> Or "assertElementPresent" if you want the test to fail if it isn't there.
2011-03-18T12:21:48  <RossPatterson> kw: Yes.
2011-03-18T12:22:02  <ken_wienecke> Well, before I do anything I need to figure out locators.
2011-03-18T12:22:18  <RossPatterson> mm: Yes.  In RC?
2011-03-18T12:22:36  *** darrenm_ has joined #selenium
2011-03-18T12:22:38  <RossPatterson> kw: Yup.  The Selenium world revolves around locators.
2011-03-18T12:23:03  <mister_m> RossPatterson: Yes. I have the xpath to the textbox itself, but I'm not sure how to grab the text it has in it so I can store it
2011-03-18T12:23:16  <mister_m> RossPatterson: possibly a slight change to the xpath
2011-03-18T12:23:38  <AutomatedTester> YAY! we are a GSoC organisation this year
2011-03-18T12:24:13  <RossPatterson> mm: selenium.GetText(...locator...).
2011-03-18T12:24:29  *** andialbrecht is now known as andialbrecht_
2011-03-18T12:25:44  <ken_wienecke> Ross, I need to play with the locator concept for awhile and then get back into this forum when I've got that down.  I saw the discussion of them in the documentation of the Selenium site, but is there any other place you would recommend for a newby?
2011-03-18T12:27:02  <RossPatterson> The IDE has a help function that shows help on a command-by-command basis, and which also includes the basics of locators.  There's also a version of it at http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-core/1.0.1/reference.html, although it's probably older than what you've got installed.
2011-03-18T12:27:39  <ken_wienecke> Ross: Thanks for your help. I'll look at those things ASAP.
2011-03-18T12:27:50  <RossPatterson> Happy Friday!
