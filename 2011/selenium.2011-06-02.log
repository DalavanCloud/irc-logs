2011-06-02T01:32:41  <__mike> hi does anyone know about when screenshotting for chromedriver will be added ? should an issue be raised for this ?
2011-06-02T01:33:22  <amitev> omfg RC1 released
2011-06-02T01:36:00  <marri> hi , Can some one help me how  do use chrome driver executable ? Please share me the procedure /steps
2011-06-02T01:38:23  *** binken has joined #selenium
2011-06-02T01:41:55  <__mike> the only difference is that you need to set the system property "webdriver.chrome.driver". so something like System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\Users\\......\\ChromeDriver.exe")
2011-06-02T01:42:06  <__mike> Then you can just start ChromeDriver like the regular ones : http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver
2011-06-02T01:42:36  <freynaud> __mike: should be done
2011-06-02T01:43:14  <freynaud> eranm: Hi. Do you know if the new chrome driver stuff is out?  I can't see the new flags in the ChromeDriver.java file
2011-06-02T01:45:07  <__mike> oh ! let me check it out : )
2011-06-02T01:46:33  <eranm> hi freynaud , let me check
2011-06-02T01:46:57  <eranm> freynaud, are you using chromedriver 13.0.775.0 ?
2011-06-02T01:47:21  <binken> Does Advanced User Interactions is available on Chrome
2011-06-02T01:47:31  <eranm> binken, not yet
2011-06-02T01:48:02  <binken> I am very interested in how to implentent it?
2011-06-02T01:48:18  <binken> I have the source code checkout from google
2011-06-02T01:48:46  <binken> I wanna to see how IE or firefox do the adanved user interactions
2011-06-02T01:49:30  <eranm> It's a bit different for chrome, since the ChromeDriver lives inside Chromium source tree.
2011-06-02T01:50:07  <eranm> Generating input events for Chrome is different since we have access to the browser's internals, using Chrome's automation proxy
2011-06-02T01:50:25  <eranm> for IE and Firefox we generate the input events at the OS level ("native events") since there's no browser cooperation.
2011-06-02T01:50:52  <freynaud> eranm: i'm not using anything yet
2011-06-02T01:51:02  <freynaud> I checked the java file launching it
2011-06-02T01:51:27  <freynaud> and it's  super(new ChromeCommandExecutor(service), DesiredCapabilities.chrome());
2011-06-02T01:51:41  <binken> It's a bit trouble for me do the draganddrop action on Chrome...
2011-06-02T01:51:47  <freynaud> so anything i pass in the original capability will be ignored. Even if the server can handle it
2011-06-02T01:52:06  *** lisak has joined #selenium
2011-06-02T01:53:02  <binken> So for chrome, we need do this through the ChromeDriverService?
2011-06-02T01:55:58  <eranm> freynaud, let me check
2011-06-02T01:56:51  <eranm> By the way, I'm about to push RC2 since the IE driver is broken in RC1 under some protected mode settings.
2011-06-02T01:57:53  <freynaud> oki
2011-06-02T01:58:38  <binken> eranm, for chromedriver in c#. I think the service window should be hiden
2011-06-02T01:59:19  <freynaud> what I was expecting for the chrome flags, but maybe I'm wrong, was to have them propagated from the DesitredCapability, all the way to ChromesDriverServer constructor, and have the flags appeneded to --port=%d
2011-06-02T02:01:03  <eranm> binken, I'm not sure what you mean. The ChromeDriver in c# should be using the RemoteWebDriver to communicate with the chromedriver server (that will start Chrome when a new session is created)
2011-06-02T02:01:20  <binken> I mean the chromeservice
2011-06-02T02:01:42  <binken> which can be downloaded from selenium google site
2011-06-02T02:01:45  <__mike> I think the new ChromeDriver is broken. The following code : http://pastebin.com/AtffVccz will launch the Chrome browser but it doesn't load a site
2011-06-02T02:02:40  <binken> Eranm, I mean the ChromeDriverService class
2011-06-02T02:02:42  <eranm> freynaud, the capability you're looking for is to pass arbitrary flags to chrome?
2011-06-02T02:03:22  <binken> at line 114, I think we should add '' this.driverServiceProcess.StartInfo.CreateNoWindow = true"
2011-06-02T02:03:29  <freynaud> eranm: yes
2011-06-02T02:04:30  <freynaud> arbitrary flags actually, not to chrome. I want {"flag: 1 B C"} resulting in launching ./google-chome A B C
2011-06-02T02:04:52  <eranm> binken, what would you achieve with this change?
2011-06-02T02:05:42  <binken> current, when I do new chromedriver()
2011-06-02T02:05:54  <binken> a command line window popup
2011-06-02T02:06:49  <eranm> freynaud, you could achieve that by: service = ChromeDriverService.createDefaultService() ; driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new ChromeCommandExecutor(service), yourCapabilities)
2011-06-02T02:07:46  <eranm> Looks like an additional constructor is needed, one that accepts capabilities only and creates the default ChromeDriverService
2011-06-02T02:08:04  <eranm> binken, what's bothering you is the new command window popping up?
2011-06-02T02:08:38  <freynaud> eranm: if that works, and the param passes to the chromedriver are actually passed to google-chrome, then I'm good
2011-06-02T02:08:40  <binken> For me, Yes
2011-06-02T02:09:29  <binken> I am not sure, it's a good practice to hide this window
2011-06-02T02:10:24  *** AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
2011-06-02T02:11:29  <eranm> binken, ping jimevans about it. Sounds like a reasonable change to me, if the output from the browser is redirected somewhere else (as is done in the Java bindings)

2011-06-02T02:13:16  <krofdrakula> hi people
2011-06-02T02:13:29  <krofdrakula> i have a question re: the selenium 2.0b3 server
2011-06-02T02:13:36  <eranm> AutomatedTester, sure.
2011-06-02T02:13:56  <krofdrakula> i'm using phpunit to test against a selenium web driver using firefox and chrome
2011-06-02T02:14:13  <krofdrakula> but although i have it configured to run chrome, it just starts and firefox twice
2011-06-02T02:14:37  <krofdrakula> is there something i'm missing here? the docs say that they're being rewritten for 2.0, so i might be missing something
2011-06-02T02:15:17  <AutomatedTester> krofdrakula: can you check if there is a bug in what capabilities its asking for?
2011-06-02T02:15:31  <krofdrakula> AutomatedTester: how do i got about doing that?
2011-06-02T02:15:38  <AutomatedTester> krofdrakula: unfortunately we, the Selenium project, dont support the PHP bindings
2011-06-02T02:15:52  <krofdrakula> oh, i see
2011-06-02T02:16:01  <krofdrakula> i can refer this to the phpunit guys, then
2011-06-02T02:16:12  <AutomatedTester> krofdrakula: we're willing to try help
2011-06-02T02:16:16  <AutomatedTester> dont get me wrong
2011-06-02T02:16:34  <krofdrakula> yeah, i get it :)
2011-06-02T02:16:35  <AutomatedTester> krofdrakula: do you know where the code is for the bindings?
2011-06-02T02:16:44  <AutomatedTester> i can have a quick peek
2011-06-02T02:17:02  <krofdrakula> AutomatedTester: you mean where i configure the browser to request?
2011-06-02T02:17:08  <AutomatedTester> when the bindings tell the remote server what it wants, it sends a dictionary of what it requires
2011-06-02T02:17:20  <AutomatedTester> and if that dictionary is wrong it can launch a firefox instance
2011-06-02T02:17:20  <krofdrakula> ah, okay, lemme just grep real quick
2011-06-02T02:18:01  <__mike> yep.. new chromedriver seems to be broken on 2 of the computers i tested it on. unless something changed in how you launch it
2011-06-02T02:18:29  <AutomatedTester> krofdrakula: I look after the python bindings and this is my group of dictionaries http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/common/desired_capabilities.py
2011-06-02T02:18:45  <krofdrakula> the selenium logs seem to correctly request the correct browser:
2011-06-02T02:18:47  <krofdrakula> 11:20:50.710 INFO - Command request: getNewBrowserSession[*chrome, http://celtra.local/client] on session null

2011-06-02T02:18:57  <krofdrakula> but i'll check the phpunit request module
2011-06-02T02:19:02  <AutomatedTester> ooooo
2011-06-02T02:19:16  <AutomatedTester> this is the old Se1 API and not the Se2 API?
2011-06-02T02:19:27  <krofdrakula> methinks so, yes.
2011-06-02T02:19:33  <krofdrakula> would make sense
2011-06-02T02:19:43  <AutomatedTester> thats a different issue, never mind me
2011-06-02T02:19:56  <AutomatedTester> so asking for *chrome should launch firefox
2011-06-02T02:19:57  <krofdrakula> i just thought that with 2.0 being backwards compatible, it wouldn't matter
2011-06-02T02:20:17  <krofdrakula> no, actually, i request launching chrome, but it starts firefox instead
2011-06-02T02:20:34  <AutomatedTester> krofdrakula: *chrome is a firefox thing, been around for like ever
2011-06-02T02:20:36  <krofdrakula> so the dictionary is correctly relayed, just the wrong browser starts up
2011-06-02T02:20:45  <AutomatedTester> if you want google chrome you need *googlechrome
2011-06-02T02:20:48  <krofdrakula> ah!
2011-06-02T02:20:53  <krofdrakula> okay, lemme try that
2011-06-02T02:21:18  <AutomatedTester> *chrome launches Firefox in a less secure mode meaning we can do more with the JavaScript
2011-06-02T02:21:44  <AutomatedTester> unfortunately Google weren't thinking about that when they created there browser
2011-06-02T02:22:00  <krofdrakula> awesome! that worked like a charm
2011-06-02T02:22:09  <AutomatedTester> glad I can help :)
2011-06-02T02:22:20  <krofdrakula> i was following phpunit's docs which stated *chrome as the one to launch google chrome
2011-06-02T02:22:27  <krofdrakula> so i just assumed i was doing something wrong
2011-06-02T02:22:46  <AutomatedTester> krofdrakula: thats a bug in their docs
2011-06-02T02:22:50  <AutomatedTester> *chrome is a Firefox thing
2011-06-02T02:23:00  <AutomatedTester> always has been, always will be
2011-06-02T02:23:30  <krofdrakula> okay, good to know
2011-06-02T02:23:35  <krofdrakula> i'll relay that to the phpunit folks

2011-06-02T03:05:27  <eranm> I had a chat with Ken, the guy working on the Chrome driver, on backwards compatibility. Turns out it's very very difficult to maintain backwards compatibility between the chromedriver binary and Chrome itself
2011-06-02T03:05:29  <simonstewart> (the reason is that the original ChromeDriver polled "http://localhost" and waited for a 200

2011-06-02T03:36:32  <AutomatedTester> so do I tell the chromedriver executable the flags as options or do i pass in the flags as a key/value pair in my DesiredCapabilies dictionary?
2011-06-02T03:36:52  <simonstewart> Normally, you don't need to set any flags
2011-06-02T03:37:18  <AutomatedTester> unfortunately users dont do "normal" things

2011-06-02T03:53:06  <jarib> it's not really brain-dead when it involves a manual step to test
2011-06-02T03:53:37  <simonstewart> The problem was that we didn't run the tests after those changes landed
2011-06-02T03:53:44  <simonstewart> So what we tested wasn't what we pushed
2011-06-02T03:54:06  <jarib> which test would catch this?
2011-06-02T03:54:18  <jarib> (though i see your point, in general)
2011-06-02T03:54:20  <eranm> What we're missing is Windows VMs in two separate configurations - I believe Jim never encountered this problem because his machines are configured to have the same protected mode settings
2011-06-02T03:54:20  <simonstewart> Running the IE tests
2011-06-02T03:54:31  <jarib> right
2011-06-02T03:55:34  <jarib> simonstewart: if the IE tests were able to modify protected mode settings on the fly i'd imagine the IE driver would use the same mechanism to just work around the problem
2011-06-02T03:55:56  <jarib> so not really a question of running the tests or not, but running them with a specific IE configuration
2011-06-02T03:56:11  <simonstewart> Right. But we've got that configuration available to us
2011-06-02T03:56:50  <simonstewart> Or, put another way, if we'd run the tests on our machines before pushing, we'd have spotted this problem instantly
2011-06-02T03:56:51  <jarib> and all the tests would throw with that configuration anyway
2011-06-02T03:57:38  <simonstewart> (not now: the tests have the magic "introduce flakiness" flag)

2011-06-02T03:58:56  <freynaud> simonstewart: why do we need a new release for the protected mode thing ? the wiki for IE driver specificly say to set it right
2011-06-02T03:59:07  <simonstewart> The driver shouldn't be hanging
2011-06-02T03:59:13  <simonstewart> It should throw an exception and fail

2011-06-02T05:45:41  <simonstewart> rpk: the chrome driver picks a random port to run on
2011-06-02T05:46:08  <rpk> ok, but it just continuously polls, and never executes the test.  (the node is correctly registered with the hub)
2011-06-02T05:46:32  <simonstewart> which version of the Selenium are you using? and chrome? and the chromedriver executable?
2011-06-02T05:47:05  <selbot2> eran.mes@gmail.com half a minute ago - EranMes: Make the native component for the FirefoxDriver on Linux depend on gecko-2 sdk for Linux. Thanks to Jari's magic in r12303, the SDK will be downloaded if it's not there. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12327
2011-06-02T05:47:07  <rpk> It _should_ be Selenium 2.0, chrome 13.x from the dev channel, and the chromedriver executable from yesterday
2011-06-02T05:47:17  <simonstewart> Then it should be working
2011-06-02T05:47:22  <simonstewart> (I know that's not helpful)
2011-06-02T05:47:30  <simonstewart> The polling should time out at some point
2011-06-02T05:47:34  <simonstewart> What URL is it looking for?
2011-06-02T05:47:56  <rpk> lol (my manager is having this issue, so its kind of awkward for me to tell he configured 1 of 3 simple pieces wrong)
2011-06-02T05:48:20  <simonstewart> Give him a hug
2011-06-02T05:49:14  <rpk> simonstewart, not sure, I'll check later.  I'm pretty confident that he has the correct version of chrome, as the channel switcher only leaves 1 version.  I'm wondering if the chrome location he specified was wrong, but I think it should be the same as on the windows pc that I provided the example startup command from

2011-06-02T06:33:43  <AutomatedTester> <- no idea and guessing
2011-06-02T06:33:45  <__mike> trunk is 1.54gb on disk
2011-06-02T06:33:49  <rpk> Oh sorry, I mean the whole thing

2011-06-02T06:35:34  <AutomatedTester> rpk: Google Code tells you how much space we are using there
2011-06-02T06:35:39  <__mike> is jimevans around under a different alias ?
2011-06-02T06:37:19  <__mike> was the build file changed in latest trunk ? i can no longer build
2011-06-02T06:37:43  <simonstewart> rpk: Yes, it'll pull the entire history
2011-06-02T06:37:46  <__mike> if the gecko sdk isn't detected. in the past it just skipped
2011-06-02T06:38:04  <rpk> I'm guessing thats going to be larger than 14 gb? :(
2011-06-02T06:38:06  <simonstewart> __mike: what OS are you on?
2011-06-02T06:38:14  <__mike> windows xp
2011-06-02T06:38:18  <__mike> 32 bit
2011-06-02T06:38:19  <simonstewart> rpk: I doubt it
2011-06-02T06:38:48  <simonstewart> A few gigs, to be sure, but not 14
2011-06-02T06:38:51  <rpk> really?  With all of those prebuilt binary changes?  Won't it be pulling every binary ever?
2011-06-02T06:39:11  <simonstewart> The binaries are only a few megs at worst
2011-06-02T06:39:18  <simonstewart> It's the jars that will kill you
2011-06-02T06:39:24  <simonstewart> and the 6 copies of the mozilla sdk
2011-06-02T06:40:25  <simonstewart> I'd expect all the binaries to weigh in at around 200MB over the lifetime of the project
2011-06-02T06:41:43  <rpk> apparently the source tab for the project should say, but I'm guessing its only going to show the source size on disk to the owner of the google code project
2011-06-02T06:42:17  <simonstewart> Your project is using approximately 2856 MB out of 4096 MB total quota
2011-06-02T06:42:35  <rpk> Oh, thanks.  That'll definitely fit.
2011-06-02T06:42:46  <__mike> oh actually my 1.30gb size was inaccurate. forgot that included the build folder
2011-06-02T06:42:59  <__mike> which is around 380mb
2011-06-02T06:43:14  <simonstewart> Are you trying to fit all this on to a tiny hard disk?
2011-06-02T06:44:17  <rpk> Theres only 14gb of space left on the drive I'm mirroring to.
2011-06-02T06:44:24  <simonstewart> Ahhh....
2011-06-02T06:44:31  <simonstewart> You'll fit
2011-06-02T06:44:32  <__mike> is the build file broken ? given that it's failing when not detecting xulrunner ?
2011-06-02T06:44:42  <simonstewart> eranm: ^^
2011-06-02T06:44:48  <rpk> which is typically reasonable, selenium just has a higher than normal amount of binaries

2011-06-02T06:52:48  <eranm> Ok, I think I see the problem.
2011-06-02T06:52:53  <__mike> do you still want the trace ?
2011-06-02T06:52:59  <eranm> Yes please
2011-06-02T06:53:05  <jarib> not sure how we can signal to the dependant task that we failed though
2011-06-02T06:53:43  <eranm> jarib, look at rake-tasts/c.rb
2011-06-02T06:54:18  <eranm> The quickest fix would be to consider the dependencies to the dll() rule as optional ones
2011-06-02T06:54:34  <__mike> i piped to a file and this is what i got pastebin.com/NJkB6ikw
2011-06-02T06:54:37  <eranm> Or, if download fails, just create an empty directory and proceed
2011-06-02T06:55:02  <__mike> pastebin.com/DMWATRRv
2011-06-02T06:55:06  <__mike> that is what is on the console
2011-06-02T06:55:13  <__mike> the rest is offscreen
2011-06-02T06:55:44  <eranm> jarib, the problem is that even when building on Windows, the Firefox extension depends on //cpp:libwebdriver_firefox_so
2011-06-02T06:56:07  <eranm> which will drag libwebdriver_firefox_so in

2011-06-02T07:18:44  <__mike> jimevans: don't think so
2011-06-02T07:19:26  <jimevans> I saw the last comment to the issue report. Introducing a new dll might be problematic. Nice to know the existing technique is fundamentally sound though
2011-06-02T07:19:56  <__mike> ah okay
2011-06-02T07:20:47  <__mike> i can't really understand why the current method is not working though. of course it helps to understand the semantics of setwindowshookex
2011-06-02T07:20:57  <__mike> eranm: what is the revision of rakefile i should revert to to fix my build process ?
2011-06-02T07:21:15  <simonstewart> he's just stepped away from his machine
2011-06-02T07:21:20  <__mike> ah okay
2011-06-02T07:21:56  <jimevans> Near as I can tell, the windows hook should work.
2011-06-02T07:22:28  <__mike> the reason i know it's not being placed is because if i'm putting messageboxs at various places in the code and some of them are never hit
2011-06-02T07:22:51  <jimevans> Clearly though it doesn't in all cases.
2011-06-02T07:23:20  <__mike> so usually you can't size windows greater than screensize on your system ?
2011-06-02T07:23:37  <__mike> i heard people say they can do that without even requiring overriding wm_getminmaxinfo
2011-06-02T07:24:13  <jimevans> No on my system it works flawlessly. Every time.
2011-06-02T07:24:26  <simonstewart> Note to self: use a supported version of firefox for testing
2011-06-02T07:24:48  <__mike> i mean. is it possible that the hook isn't being placed but your system is allowing the resize anyway ?
2011-06-02T07:26:39  <jimevans> I suppose. I've not looked at the return value of setwindowshookex in awhile. That would be instructive.
2011-06-02T07:27:00  <freynaud> simonstewart: do you know if something changes with the certificates for chrome ? it use to work with bad certif, added in FF , but not anymore with 13

2011-06-02T07:29:07  <simonstewart> freynaud: but I've been wrong before

2011-06-02T07:29:16  <simonstewart> not often
2011-06-02T07:29:28  <__mike> the params on setwindowshookex looks correct. i mean it's injected into javaw.exe from memory not iexplore.exe so handing in an instance to the dll should be the right thing to do

2011-06-02T07:49:20  <XCulver> the chrome driver is the only reason i asked this
2011-06-02T07:49:33  <simonstewart> The chrome driver is still just a webdriver implementation

2011-06-02T07:51:07  <simonstewart> I think the process is left alive for the common case where a new instance is required instantly
2011-06-02T07:51:46  <simonstewart> BTW, jimevans, does the IE driver return "nativeEvents" as a boolean capability?
2011-06-02T07:52:10  <freynaud> simonstewart: that is annoying though. The last test you run will never finish if you're not using a remoteWebdriver
2011-06-02T07:52:32  <simonstewart> you can control the chromeservice directly
2011-06-02T07:52:46  <__mike> we need to explicitly kill the chromedriver.exe then ?

2011-06-02T07:56:32  <jimevans> The more I think about it, the more I see a huge duplication of effort on the part of people implementing a remote server in C++
2011-06-02T07:56:47  <__mike> dapidmini: you are running selenium tests on a html hosted on your local machine ?
2011-06-02T07:57:04  <simonstewart> jimevans: agreed
2011-06-02T07:57:37  <simonstewart> Ohhh.... this test run looks good
2011-06-02T07:57:49  <freynaud> jimevans: you can check the remote server for twin. It's in C#, it listen for json protocol, and it has no dependency
2011-06-02T07:58:00  <jimevans> Dunno what can be done about it though.
2011-06-02T07:58:36  <simonstewart> There's probably a certain level of duplication that can be removed
2011-06-02T07:59:37  <jimevans> freynaud: I wrote one of those too. http://code.google.com/p/strontium

2011-06-02T08:01:10  <__mike> freynaud : is there a recommended limit for running concurrent tests at the same time ? i just ran tests concurrently using grid on a node which ran ff, ie and chrome all at once and it seemed okay.
2011-06-02T08:01:12  <dapidmini> I'm planning on testing a business website like amazon.com
2011-06-02T08:01:33  <freynaud> __mike: it depends on your system really
2011-06-02T08:01:59  <__mike> dapidmini : the file is not going to exist under your C drive then. probably how i would do it is to get the path to the image then check that instead. i don't do c# so i don't know the api to do that
2011-06-02T08:02:14  <freynaud> __mike: from my experience, with firefox it's only a matter of tuning. If you overload the machine, it becomes slow, but doesn't crash
2011-06-02T08:02:47  <__mike> freynaud: cheers : )
2011-06-02T08:03:22  <dapidmini> __mike: btw, is checking if a video src file exists the same as checking an image src file?
2011-06-02T08:03:47  <__mike> dapidmini: depends how your api works for checking the existence of a file. i should think it's much the same though
2011-06-02T08:05:23  <__mike> dapidmini: this looks like something similar to what you want : http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/vssmartdevicesvbcs/thread/70b3cffd-7fe4-4cd9-82b3-73954519a0b9 make a webrequest there and if that fails then it's not there

2011-06-02T08:31:02  <rpk> I really wish the mindset would change, so that license based operations (where you have a license to use any version of our product), would be more understanding of new versions getting pushed out automatically
2011-06-02T08:31:20  <simonstewart> Agreed
2011-06-02T08:31:57  <eranm> rpk, the bit concerning software engineering behind this post is that you should shorten your release cycle as much as possible - have enough automated tests so teams can be confident their product is worthy of a release as soon as a new change is checked in and  the tests remain green.
2011-06-02T08:32:19  <rpk> yep, (I'm a SE, not a CS)
2011-06-02T08:33:30  <rpk> people just don't get it though, that if you automate all of your tests, that we do no additional testing on some of our products.  Theres nothing magical that happens from one build to that build becoming our next major version, besides confirming that all of the automation passed for that build.

2011-06-02T08:38:04  <jarib> we could make the download target fail silently
2011-06-02T08:38:24  <jarib> then compilation should fail and fall back to the prebuilt
2011-06-02T08:38:40  <jarib> right?
2011-06-02T08:38:50  <rpk> just include a warning / log file maybe?
2011-06-02T08:38:52  <eranm> jarib, I haven't looked into it yet. It would be excellent if we can make the download fail silently
2011-06-02T08:39:22  <eranm> The "Falling back to prebuilt" is a good enough indication that you're not getting the Firefox components built
2011-06-02T08:39:38  <jimevans> this is a metric crapload of stuff being downloaded. :)
2011-06-02T08:39:38  <eranm> jarib, all that's needed is probably to create an empty directory if the download fails / cannot be unpacked on this platform

2011-06-02T08:39:54  <rpk> yeah, thats what I mean, except instead of a note for every single one, just one note at the top pointing to a log file?

2011-06-02T08:40:25  <eranm> jimevans, but only once. and it does not live in the repository. And since Jari implemented it as a cool rake dependency, if you unpack the SDK yourself into third_party/gecko-2 no downloading will take place.
2011-06-02T08:40:37  <dapidmini> is it better to test a website that runs from my local machine or one that runs on the internet?

2011-06-02T08:40:56  <jimevans> eranm: right. i'm only kidding around. i know it's needed.
2011-06-02T08:41:11  <rpk> dapidmini: no, just that testing a website on the internet is more representative of latency

2011-06-02T08:43:06  <simonstewart> andytinkham: rc2 fixed the java drivers. The ruby ones are fine
2011-06-02T08:43:12  <andytinkham> OK, thanks
2011-06-02T08:43:22  <jimevans> andytinkham: jarib can speak to this, but i think he didn't push the gem until the IE fix was committed.
2011-06-02T08:43:59  <andytinkham> simonstewart, jimevans: Thanks. I'll update now then :)
2011-06-02T08:46:58  <jarib> andytinkham: 0.2.1 was released after the fix, yes
2011-06-02T08:47:35  <jarib> eranm: so we want it to create the directory anyway, so the download isn't retried the next time?
2011-06-02T08:47:48  <andytinkham> jarib: Excellent. Looking forward to running with the newest bits :) (and getting back to coding after a week of writing documents to justify my coding and get me more help doing so)
2011-06-02T08:48:07  <jarib> writing documents bad
2011-06-02T08:48:08  <jarib> coding good
2011-06-02T08:48:10  * jarib nods
2011-06-02T08:48:43  <eranm> Yes, on this one occasion we can provide a warning saying an empty directory was created and it should be removed if the user wants the build system to re-attempt the download
2011-06-02T08:48:50  <andytinkham> jarib: Mostly. Writing documents to get Senior VPs to let me keep coding and bring more people into the coding fold at least has good outcomes even if the writing is less fun :)
2011-06-02T08:48:53  <jarib> aye
2011-06-02T08:50:53  <jimevans> jarib, eranm: exactly what am i downloading here in the build process?
2011-06-02T08:51:06  <simonstewart> the gecko2 sdk
2011-06-02T08:51:15  <jimevans> for all platforms?
2011-06-02T08:51:23  <simonstewart> just the one you're on, i think
2011-06-02T08:51:59  <eranm> At the moment, only the linux build process depends on a downloaded SDK, but it will be all of them (assuming that works right)
2011-06-02T08:52:08  <eranm> (and Mozilla don't trim down the size of the SDK soon)
2011-06-02T08:52:39  <jimevans> then i think we have a bug somewhere. i'm on windows, and we're trying to expand the linux sdk and failing.
2011-06-02T08:52:48  <eranm> jarib, a nice optimization could be not to download the SDK and immediately create an empty directory if the platform requested differs from the platform we're running on
2011-06-02T08:52:51  <jimevans> (stupid windows)
2011-06-02T08:53:09  * jimevans wants to be the first to say it.
2011-06-02T08:53:33  <jimevans> and it's supposed to download into third_party/gecko-2?
2011-06-02T08:53:46  <eranm> jimevans, that's because we're attempting to unpack using zip on Windows, even if we've fetched something for Linux
2011-06-02T08:53:53  <eranm> third_party/gecko-2/linux, yes.
2011-06-02T08:54:29  <jimevans> i figured that was what was going on. how do i stop it?
2011-06-02T08:54:49  <eranm> jimevans, create an empty directory called 'linux' under third_party/gecko-2
2011-06-02T08:54:54  <jimevans> ok
2011-06-02T08:55:58  <jarib> this is what i mentioned earlier, we can't expand the linux sdk on windows
2011-06-02T08:56:34  <jarib> [15:18]      jarib : eranm: btw, the download rule sort of assumes you'll only need third_party/gecko-2/<current platform>
2011-06-02T08:56:37  <jarib> [15:18]  simonstew : That sounds reasonable
2011-06-02T08:56:40  <jarib> [15:18]      jarib : e.g. it doesn't currently know how to unpack zips on linux or .tar.bz2 on win
2011-06-02T08:56:45  <jimevans> i guess *somebody* has to stay on windows to catch these early. :)
2011-06-02T08:56:59  <simonstewart> Thanks jim!
2011-06-02T08:57:24  <jarib> in my defense i did check that the win32 download worked on windows
2011-06-02T08:57:25  <eranm> it's a real sacrifice you're making, staying on Windows all that time
2011-06-02T08:57:41  <jarib> indeed :)
2011-06-02T08:57:55  <eranm> jarib, what I forgot is that the firefox XPI ultimately depends on native components both from Windows and Linux
2011-06-02T08:58:14  <jarib> ok
2011-06-02T08:58:25  <jimevans> heh. most people see it as a sacrifice, i suppose.
2011-06-02T08:58:27  <simonstewart> Do we need to do rc3 already?
2011-06-02T08:58:35  * jimevans needs a macbook
2011-06-02T08:58:47  <simonstewart> Because if we do, that'd be setting some sort of record

2011-06-02T09:20:23  <jimevans> in crazy-fun, is it possible to have a wrapper task? one that just calls dependent tasks?
2011-06-02T09:20:50  <simonstewart> You can create a target in the Rakefile and then use "rake_task" in the build.desc to call it
2011-06-02T09:22:05  <jimevans> i suppose that would work, but i already call the task from the Rakefile anyway, so i'm not sure that buys me anything.

2011-06-02T09:40:18  <eranm> jarib, since we now create the directory at the beginning of the function in the Rakefile (line 233), after unpacking the sdk it's being moved into third_party/gecko-2/linux/xulrunner-sdk instead of third_party/gecko-2/linux (as third_party/gecko-2/linux now exists before the move). Would it be better to delete the directory just before moving the sdk or create the directory in the rescue block?
2011-06-02T09:41:10  <phdaemon> If i have a grid set up, and multiple RCs with Multiple OSs (Mac, Windows, Linux), and I want to take a screenshot when the app fails, do I need a screenshot path on EACH of those single machines, or just where the grid is located at?

2011-06-02T09:58:17  <jarib> ok
2011-06-02T09:58:44  <phdaemon> So i was doing this:

2011-06-02T09:59:02  <phdaemon> but it was giving me some really strange erros
2011-06-02T09:59:22  <simonstewart> There should also be a $this->captureEntirePageScreenshotAsString method
2011-06-02T09:59:54  <rpk> Is there a reason why you can't pass the browser in as a string?
2011-06-02T10:00:31  <phdaemon> rpk, what do you mean pass the browser as a string?
2011-06-02T10:00:39  <phdaemon> you arent supposed to pass it the browser

2011-06-02T12:02:57  <jimevans> yep. just hacked together a fix. works a treat.
2011-06-02T12:03:23  <jimevans> i'm going to let one of the guys who actually *knows* java take a look before i commit it.

2011-06-02T12:27:34  <Mayank> The onload alert/confirmation events in IE should be not pop  but should be "silent-ed" by selenium, this is not happening in my case. I am testing a SCORM package that gives an alert on status change <page load>, selenium fails to detect the alert, or "silent it", any help would be much appreciated, stuck at it from the past three days. tried the lates rc1 release too.
2011-06-02T12:28:51  <rpk> *cough rc2 is latest cough*  (but irrelevant to your problem)
2011-06-02T12:30:33  <Mayank> rpk: oh! did not know that., just cant get away with the alert :(

2011-06-02T12:35:19  <jleyba> Mayank: Are you using the Se2 API (webdriver)?
2011-06-02T12:38:11  <Mayank> jleyba: It just clicked me to check if the the page has an iframe :/, and yes it has, sooo stoopid of me. I am not sure, but I guess I have to change/select the frame first?
2011-06-02T12:38:39  <jleyba> first things first: are you using the Selenium classes or WebDriver?
2011-06-02T12:39:04  <Mayank> webdriver
2011-06-02T12:39:10  <Mayank> WebDriver
2011-06-02T12:39:38  <jleyba> Selenium Core (the code behind Selenium RC) is a javascript app, which is why, historically, alerts/confirms/prompts were suppressed (if it was allowed to popup, the UI thread would hang)
2011-06-02T12:40:01  <jleyba> This is *not* the case in WebDriver.  With WebDriver you should expect to actually see the pop-up
2011-06-02T12:40:37  <Mayank> Then, how can I handle it with the WebDriver?
2011-06-02T12:41:10  <jleyba> webdriver.switchTo().alert().accept()
2011-06-02T12:41:31  <Mayank> I am using the HTML table for the tests.
2011-06-02T12:41:56  <jleyba> Oh... I've never used that : )

2011-06-02T13:24:08  <phdaemon> Hey guys, quick question again please
2011-06-02T13:24:19  <phdaemon> I have this:
2011-06-02T13:24:20  <phdaemon> 				$str	= $this->captureEntirePageScreenshotToString("");
2011-06-02T13:24:20  <phdaemon> 				$img	= base64_decode($str);
2011-06-02T13:24:20  <phdaemon> 				$sv		= fopen($dir . $path . $screen, 'w');
2011-06-02T13:24:20  <phdaemon> 				fwrite($sv, $img);
2011-06-02T13:24:20  <phdaemon> 				fclose($sv);
2011-06-02T13:24:41  <phdaemon> And its actually saving an image, however, it doesnt actually save the screenshot, it just produces a tan image file
2011-06-02T13:25:44  <phdaemon> what am i doing wrong?
2011-06-02T13:28:03  <nirvdrum> What browser are you using?
2011-06-02T13:28:07  <phdaemon> firefox
2011-06-02T13:28:14  <phdaemon> as that seems to be the onlyone supported at the moment
2011-06-02T13:28:18  <phdaemon> only one*
2011-06-02T13:28:23  <phdaemon> also its running in chrome mode
2011-06-02T13:28:34  <phdaemon> which also seems to be the only mode supported for those functions
2011-06-02T13:28:52  <nirvdrum> You're running the *chrome launcher or the *firefox launcher?
2011-06-02T13:29:02  <phdaemon> *chrome
2011-06-02T13:29:22  <nirvdrum> I've never done it that way, but it will work fine with *firefox.
2011-06-02T13:29:41  <phdaemon> hmm, i read online that its only supported using the *chrome launcher
2011-06-02T13:29:42  <nirvdrum> I have no idea if that's your issue or not.
2011-06-02T13:29:55  <phdaemon> i tried *firefox just now with the same result
2011-06-02T13:30:13  <nirvdrum> You're saving it as a PNG, too?  I.e., the content type isn't getting screwed up or anything?
2011-06-02T13:30:50  <nirvdrum> And depending on your platform, you may need to open the file with 'wb' to write out binary.
2011-06-02T13:30:52  <phdaemon> yeah... png
2011-06-02T13:30:56  <phdaemon> hmmmm
2011-06-02T13:30:57  <phdaemon> that could be it
2011-06-02T13:31:06  <phdaemon> let me test that out
2011-06-02T13:33:07  <phdaemon> nope :(
2011-06-02T13:33:11  <phdaemon> same problem
2011-06-02T13:34:37  <nirvdrum> No idea then.
2011-06-02T13:34:59  <nirvdrum> Sometimes the canvas is just messed up, too.
2011-06-02T13:35:02  <nirvdrum> Try another URL?
2011-06-02T13:40:08  <phdaemon> its the same
2011-06-02T13:40:15  <phdaemon> from every RC in every OS
