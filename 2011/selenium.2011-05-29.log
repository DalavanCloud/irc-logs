2011-05-29T18:12:36  <mydog2> evening...
2011-05-29T18:13:32  <mydog2> looking for a selenium guru for a quick chat??
2011-05-29T18:50:51  <ner0x> Why would selenium not close a browser?
2011-05-29T18:50:56  <ner0x> after the test is done, I mean.
2011-05-29T18:52:10  <binken> you should call the method Selenium.close
2011-05-29T18:57:51  <ner0x> And if that doesn't work?
2011-05-29T19:00:32  <mydog2> hey guys..
2011-05-29T19:01:31  <mydog2> i was reviewing the sel docs. am i correct in thinking that selenium invokes it's own copy of "firefox" in memory?
2011-05-29T19:02:03  <mydog2> as opposed to using the system firefox..
2011-05-29T19:05:18  <trishk> ner0x: foreach (Process p in Process.GetProcessesByName("firefox")) { p.Kill(); }
2011-05-29T19:05:41  <trishk> last resort
2011-05-29T19:07:11  <ner0x> perl equivalent ?
2011-05-29T19:08:00  <trishk> beats me. It's just getting all of the firefox processes and killing them though.
2011-05-29T19:08:35  <ner0x> Well that's fine since I don't use firefox other than tests. It really should work though.
2011-05-29T19:09:04  <trishk> It might not close the browser if there's a win32 dialog open
