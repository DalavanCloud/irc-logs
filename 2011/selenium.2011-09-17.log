2011-09-17T15:01:38  <jhaski> how do you stay logged in during WebDriver session? Do you need to save the cookie before clicking on another link?
2011-09-17T15:01:53  <mashiara> jhaski: yes
2011-09-17T15:02:08  <mashiara> or maybe not... sorry
2011-09-17T15:02:14  <mashiara> I'm thinking of something else
2011-09-17T15:02:45  <jhaski> Thanks. For some reason, when I navigate to another page, I am no longer logged in.
2011-09-17T15:02:53  <mashiara> I had to make a cookie persistence thing to be able to log in once (via Shibboleth, that takes "forever" if you do it for each testcase separatetly) for a bunch of testcases
2011-09-17T15:03:49  <mashiara> but I think if you are in the same testcase the cookies stay
2011-09-17T15:04:20  <mashiara> anyway it's late so don't trust this on my word
2011-09-17T15:04:23  <jhaski> That's how I thought it would be too.
2011-09-17T15:04:27  <jhaski> Thanks for your help.

2011-09-17T15:08:09  <jhaski> I think the cookies do stay for the entire test session. I just made my program work by waiting longer for the page to redirect in order to establish the session.
