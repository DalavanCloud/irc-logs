2011-06-22T00:06:01  <freynaud> Binken: i try not to iterate. I use xpath to target exactly what I need
2011-06-22T00:06:51  <freynaud> the ebay html is not really clean.If I get a complete table, I end up with nested table in table and div etc. Impossible to work with. I have to cherry pick each cell
2011-06-22T00:07:58  <Binken> I am not sure which one is high-efficiency comparing the XPath and findElments
2011-06-22T00:08:29  <Binken> For now, I first find the table element, then use the findElements to find thoses trs
2011-06-22T00:09:06  <Binken> In previous, I use the XPath to locate those trs

2011-06-22T04:13:06  <nirvdrum> AutomatedTester: I've always seen it get slower over time.  My lame fix is to periodically reboot my test nodes.
2011-06-22T04:13:20  <AutomatedTester> fair enough
2011-06-22T04:13:42  <AutomatedTester> our grid is showing this at the moment
2011-06-22T04:13:50  <AutomatedTester> well from the chinese whispers I am hearing
2011-06-22T04:14:04  <nirvdrum> I tried to track it down, but it's obviously a tricky problem.  My suspicions were either a bad memory leak or the embedded Jetty server exhausting its thread pool.
2011-06-22T04:14:37  <nirvdrum> But the node itself is the same thing as Selenium RC server.  There's really nothing special going on there.
2011-06-22T04:14:42  <AutomatedTester> krosenvold: noticed any memory leaks in the Selenium Server lately?
2011-06-22T04:14:58  <AutomatedTester> nirvdrum: i dont think its grid, I think its the actual Selenium Server
2011-06-22T04:15:11  <nirvdrum> Agreed.

2011-06-22T04:26:35  <nirvdrum> Oh, if he's using the new nodes they didn't do heartbeats.  Only the hub did.
2011-06-22T04:26:43  <nirvdrum> I think Francois just added that.
2011-06-22T04:26:49  <AutomatedTester> its the nodes he was talking about
2011-06-22T04:27:09  <nirvdrum> If he's still using the grid 1 nodes, they do heartbeats though.
2011-06-22T04:28:12  <AutomatedTester> dunno
2011-06-22T04:28:27  <AutomatedTester> will be able to tell you tomorrow, I will be in the office then
2011-06-22T04:29:09  <nirvdrum> Francois just did a pretty hefty overhaul of the configuration items last night, too.  So that may have also impacted the heartbeat stuff.  I haven't had time to review it yet, so I can't speak to it.

2011-06-22T08:05:43  <Ivog> Ok ill point u to a good blog
2011-06-22T08:06:12  <gillz> "the automated tester" ?
2011-06-22T08:06:41  <gillz> is it that belarussian guy
2011-06-22T08:06:43  <nirvdrum> krosenvold: Hmm . . . I could probably give you access to a staging environment.  My use case is a fair bit different from many other Selenium users.  For mogotest I test a lot of different sites on a pretty constant basis.
2011-06-22T08:07:06  <Ivog> gillz: have a look at http://code.google.com/design-of-selenium-tests-for-asp-net
2011-06-22T08:07:20  <nirvdrum> I'm unfortunately not as equipped as I'd like.  I usually start with jstack, then do remote debugging and/or remote profiling.  Barring that, I try to actually trace the code.
2011-06-22T08:07:24  <gillz> ah seen that yes (-:
2011-06-22T08:07:38  <nirvdrum> But traditionally the concurrency code in Selenium has been nothing short of atrocious, so that's not exactly straightforward either.
2011-06-22T08:07:50  <krosenvold> nirvdrum: I really just need some stupid script that generates load to server with se1 traffic
2011-06-22T08:08:12  <krosenvold> nirvdrum: I think I managed to fix some of it, but there's just so much stuff going on in the se1 stack on server
2011-06-22T08:08:25  <Ivog> gillz: thats basically how my tests are set up
2011-06-22T08:08:55  <nirvdrum> krosenvold: Do you have a Ruby environment running?  I could put together a little script for you.
2011-06-22T08:08:58  <gillz> do you use gallio?
2011-06-22T08:09:17  <krosenvold> nirvdrum: Yes, I have the ruby ;) I did something like sudo apt-get ruby ;)
2011-06-22T08:09:41  <krosenvold> It'd be fun to set up the rest ;)
2011-06-22T08:10:09  <krosenvold> If you do that, I'll give it a spin
2011-06-22T08:10:31  * krosenvold has a book by his bedside about ruby, but who doesnt
2011-06-22T08:11:04  <nirvdrum> Cool.  It'll probably take me a couple days to get to it, but I'll let you know.
2011-06-22T08:11:05  <Ivog> gillz: yes

2011-06-22T08:12:17  <nirvdrum> I tried doing it with git-svn, but it always seemed to choke on me when the source trees were substantially rearranged.
2011-06-22T08:12:55  <nirvdrum> And just about any modification I made would fail to rebase properly.
2011-06-22T08:13:37  <krosenvold> I know. All the reworks around here have kept me focussed on different stuff
2011-06-22T08:14:31  <nirvdrum> It'd be cool if the authors file could be kept up-to-date, but that's a painful process.
2011-06-22T08:14:56  <krosenvold> Spending half the time running after changes to the build and just getting the basic stuff to build is not too fun
2011-06-22T08:15:21  <krosenvold> oh the authors file...
2011-06-22T08:15:25  <krosenvold> Painful bit, that

2011-06-22T08:20:09  <rpk> ah ok, so they do keep up with the Java binding implementation then
2011-06-22T08:20:10  <jimevans> antlong: indeed.
2011-06-22T08:20:44  <antlong> i might be getting back in to them shortly. i have had a crazy past few months though!
2011-06-22T08:20:53  <rpk> oh, and as long as I have your attention: (10:19:20 AM) rpk: which would you suggest is better, using implicitwait, or wrapping a webdriverwait implementation into an exists method?
2011-06-22T08:20:53  <rpk> (10:19:30 AM) rpk: (gwt necessitates waiting on every page)
2011-06-22T08:20:55  <jimevans> rpk: I know David (AutomatedTester) tries to keep up as closely as possible
2011-06-22T08:21:03  <rpk> can anyone give me input on that?
2011-06-22T08:21:12  <antlong> rpk: yeah, i work on a gwt site

2011-06-22T08:21:32  *** ksinkar has quit IRC
2011-06-22T08:21:39  <antlong> rpk: its a pain in the butt. theres a lot of callbacks, which dont block the page from being 'loaded'
2011-06-22T08:22:12  <antlong> rpk: i developed a form of se1 for this purpose, it has implicit waits in it.
2011-06-22T08:22:14  <rpk> antlong: yeah, we're finding that out.  So which approach would you recommend, implicit waits, an exists wrapper, or something else?
2011-06-22T08:22:20  <antlong> form = fork
2011-06-22T08:22:31  <rpk> antlong: webdriver has implicit waits
2011-06-22T08:22:39  <antlong> rpk: sure, but not everyone uses webdriver :)
2011-06-22T08:23:04  <antlong> the only problem youre likely to run in to with GWT and webdriver, is implicit waits to do not work when youre frame switching
2011-06-22T08:23:28  <rpk> hmmm, so then an exists wrapper for webdriverwait would be better then
2011-06-22T08:23:57  <antlong> if you look at my implementation of implicit waits in se1, youll see what the fix is :)
2011-06-22T08:24:21  <antlong> basically just add another method that time.sleep()'s and reevaluates the return of a command until its true
2011-06-22T08:26:21  <rpk> hmm, we fortunately will be on webdriver 2.0, so we at least don't have to sleep
2011-06-22T08:26:43  <antlong> sleep is in python
2011-06-22T08:26:55  <antlong> you will have to sleep until the condition is true
2011-06-22T08:26:59  <antlong> in re: to frame switching
2011-06-22T08:27:30  <rpk> once I frame switch why wouldn't the default implementation of constantly trying to access the element until timeout not work?
2011-06-22T08:27:32  <antlong> hold on ill send you a paste
2011-06-22T08:27:46  <antlong> because frame switching doesnt have implicit waits for content built in
2011-06-22T08:28:19  <rpk> shouldn't frameswitching happen every time I try and pull a webelement?
2011-06-22T08:28:41  <rpk> err, wow, shouldn't the implicit wait happen every time I try and pull a webelement, regardless of frame
2011-06-22T08:29:34  <antlong> you would think so
2011-06-22T08:29:37  <rpk> why would the frame affect my ability to try and pull an element, and then if it can't be found, try again
2011-06-22T08:29:54  <rpk> oh, I see. :)
2011-06-22T08:29:56  <antlong> i brought this up a while back, and it wasn't a simple fix in webdriver - so the 'fix' is to just make a seperate method that waits clientside.
2011-06-22T08:29:57  <antlong> http://d.pr/4B9y
2011-06-22T08:30:25  <rpk> hmm, thats unfortunate
2011-06-22T08:30:28  <antlong> wait
2011-06-22T08:30:33  <antlong> i forgot something in that paste
2011-06-22T08:31:40  <antlong> http://d.pr/KiUZ
2011-06-22T08:31:53  <antlong> keep in mind, in python, an arg can be a method or function.
2011-06-22T08:31:58  <antlong> so the use of that would be:
2011-06-22T08:32:35  <antlong> wait_for_frame_to_load_and(frame=1, timeout=60, driver.get_element_by_id('foo'))
2011-06-22T08:32:57  <antlong> which is verbose - theres more optimized ways to do it, but you should get the point from that :)
2011-06-22T08:33:04  <rpk> no, yeah, I understand
2011-06-22T08:35:38  <rpk> hmm, I presume that implicit waits will be fixed eventually though
2011-06-22T08:35:47  <antlong> honestly, it sounded a bit unlikely
2011-06-22T08:35:55  <antlong> its an edge case, and it seemed like it was a lot of work
2011-06-22T08:36:07  <rpk> I feel like wrapping most calls with exists is problematic and annoying
2011-06-22T08:36:12  <rpk> though
2011-06-22T08:36:30  <antlong> you know you dont need to use the frames with gwt right
2011-06-22T08:36:53  <antlong> if you right click on the frame, you can open it in a new tab and run your tests on that url - bypassing the whole tabbing system
2011-06-22T08:36:56  <rpk> yeah, I do.  You still need to wait though, because of the way the page is built from the injected js
2011-06-22T08:36:58  <antlong> (which is what i wound up oding)
2011-06-22T08:37:07  <antlong> yeah but implicit waits will work for that
2011-06-22T08:37:11  <rpk> exactly
2011-06-22T08:37:17  <antlong> [you are setting a time for implicit waits, right?]
2011-06-22T08:37:22  <rpk> (I wasn't asking about frames at all originally)
2011-06-22T08:38:00  <antlong> :) yeah i know - implicit waits will work for everything except that one case that i know of
2011-06-22T08:38:06  <rpk> basically if you're not using implicit waits, you need to use webdriverwait in certain places, which most people apparently wrap with a function
2011-06-22T08:38:17  <antlong> why wouldnt you use implicit waits though?
2011-06-22T08:38:23  <rpk> my one concern was that by using implicit waits you might cover over other possible issues
2011-06-22T08:38:55  <jarib> that's a very valid concern
2011-06-22T08:39:11  <rpk> like event ordering, you might not notice that an element wasn't immediately available that should have been
2011-06-22T08:39:21  <jarib> i always prefer waiting explicitly
2011-06-22T08:39:21  <antlong> i generally try not to base a failure of pass on how long something takes, but rather what the state of the application is at that time
2011-06-22T08:39:54  <rpk> jarib: are there any scenarios that make waiting explicitly a good idea?
2011-06-22T08:40:17  <rpk> I need a more specific argument than it 'might cover over other possible issues'
2011-06-22T08:40:42  <jarib> i just like knowing what's going on
2011-06-22T08:40:48  <antlong> sure, but they could produce false failures
2011-06-22T08:40:59  <antlong> think about it like this:
2011-06-22T08:41:18  <rpk> unlikely.  The argument for implicit waits is that its going to be a catch all, and saves people time when writing tests
2011-06-22T08:41:27  <antlong> do_x(); do_y() achieves the same thing as do_x(); wait_for(y);
2011-06-22T08:41:31  <jarib> explicit waits can't produce any false failures that implicit waits won't
2011-06-22T08:41:54  <antlong> rpk: no, the usefulness of it, is that its going to be doing the same exact thing you would be doing otherwise
2011-06-22T08:42:09  <antlong> you cant get to y() if x() fails anyway - so why write in an explicit wait?
2011-06-22T08:42:11  <rpk> ^ exactly, antlong: consider if do_x() should have been available immediately
2011-06-22T08:42:29  <antlong> rpk:  it will immediately continue, when x() passes
2011-06-22T08:42:38  <antlong> it is not blocking, if the command passes
2011-06-22T08:42:49  <rpk> yes, but perhaps theres a more serious, underlying issue, if x wasn't available immediately
2011-06-22T08:42:57  <rpk> you remove a possible indicator of failure
2011-06-22T08:43:16  <antlong> rpk: then you can set implicitly_wait to 0, before that point
2011-06-22T08:43:35  <rpk> then I might as well use an explicit wait :)
2011-06-22T08:43:43  <antlong> sure for some particular uses
2011-06-22T08:43:54  <antlong> but really your tests shouldnt be 'dependent' on time
2011-06-22T08:44:02  <antlong> not functional tests anyway
2011-06-22T08:44:18  <rpk> hmm,  I guess it comes down to: do we think more elements we're accessing should be on the page immediately, or would not.
2011-06-22T08:44:38  <antlong> GWT doesnt work that way unfortunately
2011-06-22T08:45:12  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-06-22T08:45:25  <antlong> if you look at how gwt is producing that page, the data comes from the backend rather quickly, the bottleneck is that your machine has to paint everything (via js) - the more data, the more your computer has to work to render everything
2011-06-22T08:45:47  <antlong> so as your site grows, you're always going to have to change your explicit waits to account for this increase
2011-06-22T08:46:25  <antlong> rpk: my basis for my comments stem from working on a 3 year old gwt site that is MASSIVE, i learned these lessons the hard way :D

2011-06-22T12:07:11  <jarib> laffer1_: the latest release works with Firefox 5

2011-06-22T14:03:21  <davehunt> hey nirvdrum
2011-06-22T14:03:29  <nirvdrum> Yo.
2011-06-22T14:03:38  <davehunt> We're seeing some serious performance issues with Selenium 2.0 and RC nodes
2011-06-22T14:04:06  <davehunt> You aware of any outstanding issues?
2011-06-22T14:05:50  <nirvdrum> Just stuff that's been there for probably over a year.
2011-06-22T14:06:04  <nirvdrum> I'm going to try to get a thread dump over to krosenvold since he's smarter than me.
2011-06-22T14:07:23  <davehunt> I'm comparing 2.0rc2 with pre grid 2 beta
2011-06-22T14:09:02  <nirvdrum> I was seeing issues going back into the alphas.
2011-06-22T14:09:18  <nirvdrum> But I couldn't track down the root cause.  Jetty just seems to leak threads.
2011-06-22T14:09:27  <nirvdrum> If you can take a jstack output of your node, that'd be helpful.

2011-06-22T14:13:12  <nirvdrum> davehunt: Same issue?  Because that issue really has nothing to do with grid as far as I can tell.

2011-06-22T14:18:48  <nirvdrum> davehunt: Are you using the same nodes though?
2011-06-22T14:19:08  <nirvdrum> Unless I'm misunderstanding, you're telling me two contradictory things.
2011-06-22T14:19:08  <davehunt> same nodes as?
2011-06-22T14:19:19  <nirvdrum> How are you connecting your RC nodes to the hub?
2011-06-22T14:19:32  <nirvdrum> E.g., I'm still using the grid 1 nodes to connect to a grid 2 hub.
2011-06-22T14:19:43  <davehunt> nirvdrum: It's all here: https://github.com/mozilla/moz-grid-config/tree/grid2
2011-06-22T14:19:50  <davehunt> grid2 nodes in rc mode
2011-06-22T14:19:54  <davehunt> grid2 hub
2011-06-22T14:20:10  <nirvdrum> Would it be possible to try out the hybrid rather than going all grid 1 again?
2011-06-22T14:20:25  <nirvdrum> It'd at least help us narrow down the problem.
2011-06-22T14:20:28  <nirvdrum> If not, that's cool too.
2011-06-22T14:20:49  <davehunt> possible, but I'm not sure I can afford much more time on this today
2011-06-22T14:21:37  <davehunt> we have test runs that we are dependant on, so I'd like it back to stable/performant
2011-06-22T14:23:52  <nirvdrum> That's fine.
2011-06-22T14:24:20  <davehunt> I have been able to replicate the issue locally, so I can certainly do some experiments
2011-06-22T14:25:01  <dhemery> Does Selenium 0.9.3 offer a way to find the screen coordinates of the top left corner of the browser's canvas?
2011-06-22T14:26:23  <davehunt> nirvdrum: I can raise a issue for this if there isn't already one, and I'd suggest it blocks rc4
2011-06-22T14:26:31  <davehunt> or whatever is the next release
2011-06-22T14:27:15  <adamgoucher> dhemery: 0.9.3? upgrade already :)
2011-06-22T14:27:15  <dhemery> Whoops, I meant Selenium 1.0.3.
2011-06-22T14:27:59  <nirvdrum> davehunt: Sure.  But without being able reproduce whatever problem you're seeing, that's going to be mighty hard.  Like I said, I've seen Selenium RC Server leak up to 2,500 threads from Jetty, but that's been an issue going back as far as I can recall.
2011-06-22T14:28:23  <nirvdrum> davehunt: The other thing I'd be interested in is if you go back to grid 1, use the RC 2 JAR for selenium server.

2011-06-22T14:28:34  <nirvdrum> So at least the selenium server is the latest version.
2011-06-22T14:28:49  <davehunt> We do that anyway

2011-06-22T14:31:15  <nirvdrum> Hopefully we can work it out.

2011-06-22T15:04:06  <adamgoucher> and when they release things the downloads page should be updated, etc.

2011-06-22T23:23:40  <rpk___> yep
2011-06-22T23:23:52  <Binken> Actually it works for me

2011-06-22T23:24:05  <Binken> I'll try again :)
2011-06-22T23:24:12  <rpk___> even added a 2 second thread sleep
2011-06-22T23:25:07  <Binken> because the IE block the scripts
2011-06-22T23:25:22  <Binken> it's a file format
2011-06-22T23:25:27  <Binken> not url
2011-06-22T23:25:29  <Binken> format
2011-06-22T23:25:34  <rpk___> ? I have protected mode off though...
2011-06-22T23:25:42  <rpk___> maybe my sec settings need to be further relaxed
2011-06-22T23:25:46  <Binken> It's not the case
2011-06-22T23:26:30  <Binken> it shows IE restricted this webpage from running scripts or ActiveX controls
2011-06-22T23:26:53  <Binken> below the IE window
2011-06-22T23:28:48  <rpk___> yeah, got it working
2011-06-22T23:29:06  <rpk___> I can't check ff though, my version is too high
2011-06-22T23:29:13  <rpk___> but go ahead and file a bug with your case
2011-06-22T23:30:00  <Binken> :-) Thanks
