2011-03-04T02:24:48  <ato> Morning.
2011-03-04T02:24:52  <simonstewart> Today, I shall mostly be working on the IDL
2011-03-04T02:27:14  *** soc42 has quit IRC
2011-03-04T02:39:11  <simonstewart> I'm thinking of just adding the raw IDL files straight into the wiki
2011-03-04T02:45:10  <jarib> simonstewart: so, webidl?
2011-03-04T02:56:21  <simonstewart> Yeah
2011-03-04T02:56:25  <simonstewart> Seems like a good idea
2011-03-04T02:56:47  <simonstewart> Once I've got the IDL generated and checked in, it'll be time to start putting together the docs
2011-03-04T02:57:09  <simonstewart> Sound like a good plan?
2011-03-04T02:57:13  <simonstewart> Got to go.

2011-03-04T09:08:50  <AutomatedTester> but tbh, the people using it are probably government officials
2011-03-04T09:08:54  <AutomatedTester> and wont upgrade
2011-03-04T09:09:05  <AutomatedTester> because IT dont want to take a risk
2011-03-04T09:09:44  <jimevans> True that. As it happens, though, the problems I was grousing about the other day weren't IE6-specific; they were XP-specific.
2011-03-04T09:10:18  <AutomatedTester> oh dear
2011-03-04T09:10:40  <AutomatedTester> did you solve it?
2011-03-04T09:10:59  <jimevans> yes, KirillJacobson (an incredibly bright and patient chap) and I have confirmed that my IE driver crash problems also happen on XP with IE8.
2011-03-04T09:11:18  <jimevans> We haven't yet solved it, but we're working on it.

2011-03-04T12:12:11  <simonstewart> ?
2011-03-04T12:21:16  <antlong> simonstewart, it looks like a standard JS alert
2011-03-04T12:21:41  <simonstewart> Well, yes. But in Firefox that'll be a call to an XPCOM component
2011-03-04T12:22:38  <antlong> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/nsIPromptService#alert
2011-03-04T12:23:50  <simonstewart> It used to be that
2011-03-04T12:23:54  <simonstewart> I _think_ it's changed
2011-03-04T12:25:15  <jimevans> simonstewart: do i remember right that the deprecated parts of the api are hover and speed?
2011-03-04T12:25:28  <simonstewart> Speed has been deleted
2011-03-04T12:25:37  <simonstewart> Hover is moving to the advanced user actions API
2011-03-04T12:25:42  <simonstewart> Yeah
2011-03-04T12:25:43  <simonstewart> :)
2011-03-04T12:26:19  <jimevans> in java yes, neither change has been made in .net yet. need to deprecate for beta3, remove speed in beta4.
2011-03-04T12:26:43  <simonstewart> k
2011-03-04T12:26:46  <simonstewart> Sounds like a plan
2011-03-04T12:26:58  <jarib> i was a bit surprised by this, e.g. there's no replacement for hover in firefox yet
2011-03-04T12:27:12  <simonstewart> There's move to element offset
2011-03-04T12:27:20  <jarib> working, in firefox?
2011-03-04T12:27:29  <simonstewart> you'd need to ask eran

2011-03-04T12:51:05  <simonstewart> The idea is to sit next to teams migrating from Selenium 1 to Selenium 2
2011-03-04T12:51:39  <simonstewart> and, you know, be helpful
2011-03-04T12:51:42  <antlong> interesting
2011-03-04T12:51:54  <antlong> might be a good use of time to attempt a 1-to-2 tool

2011-03-04T14:43:56  <jimevans> hi, jleyba
2011-03-04T14:44:35  <jleyba> hi
2011-03-04T14:45:19  <jimevans> any ideas off the top of your head what's going on with the atoms header file?
2011-03-04T14:45:36  <jleyba> No, I'm stumped.
2011-03-04T14:46:40  <jleyba> The iPhoneDriver is working just fine, and it also uses the compiled atoms
2011-03-04T14:48:21  <jleyba> Does the IEDriver generate a log file?
2011-03-04T14:48:38  <jimevans> alas, no.

2011-03-04T14:54:15  <jimevans> I'm debugging it now. There's a JavaScript error reported by the browser.
2011-03-04T14:56:59  <jimevans> I'm running a test that calls clear(), and when I run the test, the standard IE JS error shield is displayed in the IE status bar
