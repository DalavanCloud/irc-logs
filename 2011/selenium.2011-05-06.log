2011-05-06T06:42:41  *** larrys has joined #selenium
2011-05-06T06:42:44  *** jonathanrwallace has quit IRC
2011-05-06T06:42:50  <dwilkins> I'm pretty good with Linux/JS/LAMP,etc, not so much with Java.   I'm struggling with where to start with the Selenium Server.   I assume 2.x is the way to go if I'm implementing anew...
2011-05-06T06:43:11  *** mupp3t has joined #selenium
2011-05-06T06:43:28  <RossPatterson> Maybe, maybe not.  1.x has a lot of usage in the field, 2.x is still in Beta.
2011-05-06T06:44:24  <RossPatterson> But the way you deal with the server is completely different between Selenium 1.0 (and the   Selenium RC API in 2.0) and the WebDriver API in Selenium 2.0.
2011-05-06T06:44:37  <dwilkins> RossPatterson: Thanks - I've got a high risk tolerance for this (going from no client testing framework to having one), so beta *sounds* ok.
2011-05-06T06:44:59  <RossPatterson> Starting the RC server is trivial - you run the selenium-server.jar file with a few parameters.
2011-05-06T06:46:01  <dwilkins> Same on 1.0 and 2.0?   There aren't any jar files like that in 2.0
2011-05-06T06:48:32  <RossPatterson> Hmm ... I forget how the JAR files are named in 2.0.  But yes, for the RC server, it's the same - 2.0 contains *both* the RC and WebDriver APIs (including the RC server), although that's really poorly documented and explained.
2011-05-06T06:48:37  <RossPatterson> Hang on.
2011-05-06T06:50:15  <dwilkins> I'm pretty tolerant of poor docs too - not a problem.   My main problem is the Java bit.   It says to crank up your favorite IDE (I assume eclipse).    Emacs would be nice, but I wouldn't know where to start...
2011-05-06T06:51:01  <RossPatterson> I believe it's selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar
2011-05-06T06:52:45  <RossPatterson> Again, it depends on which API you're focusing on - RC or WebDriver.  I can't help you with WebDriver, except to say that there isn't really a server, the whole schmeer runs inside your test process.  For RC, there's a geniune server, and you start it and then connect to it using one of several language bindings.
2011-05-06T06:54:51  <barancev> dwilkins: what landuage are you ok with?
2011-05-06T06:55:05  <dwilkins> RossPatterson: Ok - I'm loading eclipse now - maybe I have to compile it to make selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar
2011-05-06T06:55:07  <barancev> selenium has bingings to various languages
2011-05-06T06:55:48  <barancev> yes, server is writter in Java
2011-05-06T06:56:11  <dwilkins> barancev: My *assumption* is that if I want to automate testing between different browsers / OS I need to have the Selenium Server going, so I'm trying to figure out what that entails.
2011-05-06T06:56:47  <AutomatedTester> dwilkins: download the standalone jar that RossPatterson mentioned
2011-05-06T06:56:51  <dwilkins> I'm cool with Perl/Ruby/PHP/shell, etc.
2011-05-06T06:56:54  <barancev> but you don't need to stick to Java to use it, you may write tests in any language of you choise: Java, .Net, ruby, python
2011-05-06T06:57:12  <barancev> se1.0 has bindings to PHP and Perl too
2011-05-06T06:57:15  <dwilkins> AutomatedTester: K - going to look for that now
2011-05-06T06:57:28  <AutomatedTester> http://selenium.googlecode.com
2011-05-06T06:57:35  <AutomatedTester> there is a download section
2011-05-06T06:57:48  <AutomatedTester> then pick a language and download the bindings from that language
2011-05-06T06:57:49  <dwilkins> Oh - I downloaded it and unzipped it - maybe I shot myself in the foot (again)
2011-05-06T06:58:19  * dwilkins facepalm
2011-05-06T07:00:07  <barancev> dwilkins: unzipped? selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar is an "executable" jar
2011-05-06T07:00:12  <RossPatterson> Hee hee ... that's it.  You just run the JAR ("java -jar selenium-whatever.jar").
2011-05-06T07:00:38  <dwilkins> barancev: yeah, but you can unzip a jar (which I did)
2011-05-06T07:01:02  <barancev> yes, you can, sure, if you want :)
2011-05-06T07:01:03  <dwilkins> Thanks a lot guys - I knew it was something simple.   I was trying too hard.
2011-05-06T07:01:25  * RossPatterson always thought Sun screwed that up - JARs should have been just an archive, some other "file type" should have been used for executable files.

2011-05-06T07:16:38  <DarkRift> RossPatterson, the only problem I can see is that with the javascript approach, not all the browsers support to make screenshots, which is what I really need (my boss doesn't want to rely exclusively on junits for GUI testing for the look as well), so 2.0 WebDriver is way to go, but I can't seen to get a hold on how grid 2.0 would send the tests to the WebDriver nodes ...
2011-05-06T07:17:20  <DarkRift> and it doesn't works that well so far on my machine, well been doing alot of tests with ajax, and sometimes (I don't know why yet) some links work in one test, and doesn't in another, even if it's the same setup

2011-05-06T07:22:41  <DarkRift> would grid send the .class directly to the nodes ?
2011-05-06T07:22:57  <DarkRift> so the node would execute the class itself
2011-05-06T07:23:00  <AutomatedTester> no
2011-05-06T07:23:44  <AutomatedTester> it sends rest calls that webdriver uses to the nodes
2011-05-06T07:23:55  <AutomatedTester> your test speaks to a central point
2011-05-06T07:24:07  <AutomatedTester> and that point, or hub as we call it, sends it to the nodes
2011-05-06T07:24:21  <AutomatedTester> only a REST call is sent to the node
2011-05-06T07:24:24  <DarkRift> all nodes ?
2011-05-06T07:24:33  <AutomatedTester> no not all nodes
2011-05-06T07:24:51  <AutomatedTester> unless you tell your tests to run in parallel
2011-05-06T07:26:02  <DarkRift> what I'm trying to do is, We need to test different versions of browsers, and sometimes the versions are different for the tests, like there's some test we need to check against IE6, IE7, IE8, FF2, FF3, and some others would not need to validate IE6 and FF2, only the 3 others
2011-05-06T07:26:37  <AutomatedTester> so you tell the grid the capabilites you need
2011-05-06T07:26:45  <AutomatedTester> and it redirects the calls accordingly
2011-05-06T07:26:52  <DarkRift> how do I tell it to ? from the tests itself ?

2011-05-06T07:54:08  <DarkRift> AutomatedTester would that work to tell the grid to connect to the node that has IE6 webdriver ? new DesiredCapabilities("internet explorer", "6*", Platform.WINDOWS);
2011-05-06T07:54:22  <DarkRift> can I suggest an amelioration as well ?
2011-05-06T07:55:09  <mupp3t> AutomatedTester: I found the problem with my existing tests, misconfiguration on my part. Now I've got old and new tests running, I'll get down to trying it out properly next week.

2011-05-06T09:02:01  <oaror> jleyba: When you say yet - is it planned functioinality for a subsequent release?
2011-05-06T09:06:46  <jleyba> oaror: It's currently possible on Firefox and, I believe, IE
2011-05-06T09:06:47  <jleyba> see http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/UploadTest.java
2011-05-06T09:07:06  <jleyba> The catch is the browser and test need to be running from the same machine
2011-05-06T09:07:21  <jleyba> There have been discussions for a more robust solution
2011-05-06T09:07:58  <jleyba> So right now, file uploads just "happen" to work in FF and IE.  In the near future (I'd say by end of summer), we should have an official solution that works for all browsers
