2011-07-14T00:37:20  <Killa__> Hello. I am working on an app under Ubuntu, Rails. I want to write a test that will check app's behaviour after rolling mouse over a certain elements. There is a lot of stuff written about mouseover function not really working under linux, but most of it is old. Is it now possible to test it somehow?
2011-07-14T00:37:32  <Killa__> Maybe a walkaround of some kind?
2011-07-14T00:37:54  <Binken[A]> Javascript to do this is a workaround

2011-07-14T01:59:38  <soc42> in the selenium ide ff-addon, on the left there is the field named "Test Case" and when opening there is the first entry "untitled*" test case
2011-07-14T02:00:14  *** Mayank1 is now known as Mayank
2011-07-14T02:01:08  <soc42> now, i do a right-click on the untitled entry and then there are two fields: "file" (on the top) and "title" (below)
2011-07-14T02:01:31  <soc42> how can i fill in something in the "file"-field?
2011-07-14T02:01:50  <soc42> can this field be used to save a file or re-use a file?

2011-07-14T03:32:39  <acroyear2> When running a test suite from cmd in 2.0.0, the selenium testrunner doesn't highlight the current command in Firefox 5 in the way it does in IE8. Furthermore, it stops with no warning during tests that work in IE8 - is this something familiar to anyone?

2011-07-14T03:34:25  <jarib> freynaud: yeah, the chrome driver is special since it has some direct access to the browser
2011-07-14T03:34:50  <jarib> not sure exactly what changes when you enable native events there, but that should be cross-platform

2011-07-14T05:15:33  <AutomatedTester> Binken_: how do you know the value of elements[1] is the right option in the select
2011-07-14T05:15:44  <AutomatedTester> actually that it is the right select
2011-07-14T05:17:59  <Binken_> What do you mean?
2011-07-14T05:18:23  <Binken_> David?
2011-07-14T05:21:44  <AutomatedTester> you search for a select
2011-07-14T05:22:08  <AutomatedTester> and then you don't use that select to search for options, you just ask the driver for a list of options
2011-07-14T05:22:41  <AutomatedTester> var select = driver.FindElement()
2011-07-14T05:22:53  <AutomatedTester> var options = select.FindElements()
2011-07-14T05:23:08  <AutomatedTester> is different to var select = driver.FindElement()
2011-07-14T05:23:17  <AutomatedTester> var options = driver.FindElements()
2011-07-14T05:23:23  <freynaud> jarib: https://gist.github.com/1082364 is my worklog / TODO
2011-07-14T05:23:43  <Binken_> Yes, I know what you mean
2011-07-14T05:23:46  <AutomatedTester> you *may* get different results either approach
2011-07-14T05:24:19  <Binken_> I think use the findelements() is enough
2011-07-14T05:24:36  <AutomatedTester> so you are 100% sure its the right element
2011-07-14T05:25:05  <Binken_> I just wanna to say, click the options in this case, it does not fire the click event
2011-07-14T05:25:27  <Binken_> I have to use elements[1].Click() twice to fire the click event
2011-07-14T05:25:51  <AutomatedTester> Binken_: what I am trying to do is be 100% that the click is the issue and not the finding the element
2011-07-14T05:26:46  <Binken_> :-) Yeah,

2011-07-14T05:39:26  <__mike> Hi simonstewart. I was wondering whether WebDriver has support for Chrome Frame. It seems some people got it working with Selenium RC but I wasn't able to get very far with WebDriver
2011-07-14T05:39:39  <simonstewart> Test with Chrome
2011-07-14T05:39:52  <simonstewart> ChromeFrame is a weird one
2011-07-14T05:40:13  <__mike> Ah so there is no support, right ? It's unfortunate we are not allowed to install Chrome in-house yet
2011-07-14T05:40:22  <simonstewart> Right
2011-07-14T05:40:23  <Binken_> yt austra the choke
2011-07-14T05:40:32  <simonstewart> But you can install chromeframe?
2011-07-14T05:40:34  <simonstewart> *sigh*

2011-07-14T05:41:01  <__mike> I wasn't even able to install that. A colleague did after getting BU authorisation
2011-07-14T05:41:13  <simonstewart> And then we'll kick off the 2.1 release cycle, I think

2011-07-14T05:42:16  <__mike> simonstewart : our team cheated by getting Chrome installed quietly under the table : )
2011-07-14T05:42:27  <simonstewart> Write a small test case in one of the existing tests, then run the SingleTestSuite (configured to use that test) via : ./go test_single

2011-07-14T05:43:04  <simonstewart> Always made me feel irked
2011-07-14T05:44:19  <__mike> Chrome is getting rolled out firmwide soon but needs to go through a tonne of security checks + lockdowns :/ the current solution is people are allowed a virtualised version running on top of App-V. chrome 8 i believe.....
2011-07-14T05:44:42  <simonstewart> chrome 8?
2011-07-14T05:44:44  <__mike> i tried to set up the virtualised version with selenium without much success :/

2011-07-14T06:06:09  <RossPatterson> __mike: It looks like the Ant task just passes the browser="whatever" string along to the browser launcher intact.

2011-07-14T06:06:47  <AutomatedTester> wow... even I am impressed with how bad that test name is
2011-07-14T06:07:43  <simonstewart> After giving The Intern a hard time with test naming, I probably wrote it
2011-07-14T06:07:55  <__mike> RossPatterson: do you know whether the browser launcher allows custom paths to browsers ? unfortunately i haven't touched the Selenese Ant task
2011-07-14T06:08:30  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: this one I wrote or the Googler who did most of the AUI work for python

2011-07-14T06:11:29  <adamgoucher> Samit: pushing se-ide 1.1.0 out now. as soon as we figure out / fix format switching not losing people's data then 1.2.0 will go out
2011-07-14T06:11:59  <RossPatterson> __mike: Me neither, but from what I can see, any browser string that works with the server's "-htmlSuite" option should work with the Ant task too.  They both devolve quickly down to the HTMLLauncher class, with no editting of the string beforehand.
2011-07-14T06:12:31  <simonstewart> Try quoting "*firefox /path"
2011-07-14T06:12:44  <simonstewart> Perhaps it's being broken up into separate args, rather than being treated as one

2011-07-14T06:33:10  <simonstewart> Just wondering. I know that we had some problems with it before
2011-07-14T06:33:42  <jimevans> There are a couple of calls to it, and some places where it's #include'd so I know it works.
2011-07-14T06:34:08  <simonstewart> Groovy
2011-07-14T06:34:09  <jimevans> Good Thing report: I just had the lead for one of our (the company I work for) products tell me they'd completed a switch-over to WebDriver from WatiN.

2011-07-14T06:35:27  <adamgoucher> i really wish that was piratepaste not privatepaste
2011-07-14T06:35:29  <jimevans> simonstewart: It took a little adjustment, but the framework on that project isolates the driver to a specific layer, so the change-over was reasonably smooth.
2011-07-14T06:35:53  <simonstewart> Good code design
2011-07-14T06:35:58  * simonstewart likes
2011-07-14T06:36:15  <jimevans> yeah, a co-worker and I worked on that implementation.
2011-07-14T06:36:23  <simonstewart> Knew you had good taste
2011-07-14T06:36:31  <simonstewart> So, in interactions_common.cpp
2011-07-14T06:36:48  <simonstewart> we assert that the points given are >= 0
2011-07-14T06:36:52  * jimevans fires up VS2010
2011-07-14T06:37:04  <simonstewart> Our bug is caused by a point being (legitimately) at -1.
2011-07-14T06:37:12  <simonstewart> Should we just be rounding?
2011-07-14T06:40:09  <RossPatterson> __mike: That jives with the idea that the browser string isn't arriving in the form it needs to take.  But without DEBUG logging, it's hard to tell.  If you can find a way to set the "selenium.debugMode

2011-07-14T06:40:37  <RossPatterson> __mike: That jives with the idea that the browser string isn't arriving in the form it needs to take.  But without DEBUG logging, it's hard to tell.  If you can find a way to set the "selenium.debugMode" Java property to "true", that should turn up the  logging.

2011-07-14T07:07:53  <rpk> Does google / anyone provide a wrapper for the controls for use with selenium?  The nested element structure makes it very difficult to access elements, for example, to expand a tree item.

2011-07-14T07:16:32  <jimevans> simonstewart: it might be worthwhile to add a test to the java tests to find an element by link text where the text contains a double-quote
2011-07-14T07:16:40  <AutomatedTester> also look at my GTAC talk from 2008
2011-07-14T07:16:49  <AutomatedTester> sorry, 2009
2011-07-14T07:17:54  <jimevans> admittedly, it's probably not an issue for any driver but the IE driver, but you never know.

2011-07-14T08:01:06  <jimevans> I don't remember if anybody sent an answer when I asked before. Programmatically setting a browser proxy only works on Firefox, right?
2011-07-14T08:01:21  <simonstewart> nope
2011-07-14T08:01:24  <simonstewart> should also work with IE

2011-07-14T08:02:06  <jimevans> You can set the browser to use a proxy in IE? How does that work?

2011-07-14T08:08:11  <jarib> and if so, wouldn't it make sense to move that code from java into the IE driver and expose it in desiredCapabilities?
2011-07-14T08:08:15  *** hansjd has left #selenium
2011-07-14T08:08:39  <jimevans> jarib: afaik, the native IE driver doesn't set the proxy.
2011-07-14T08:08:46  <jarib> right
2011-07-14T08:09:04  <jimevans> which is why i asked. :)
2011-07-14T08:09:05  <jarib> i think we may have some Se1 Java code to modify the registry
2011-07-14T08:09:10  <jarib> or something
2011-07-14T08:09:18  <simonstewart> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/ie/InternetExplorerDriver.java#116
2011-07-14T08:09:19  <jarib> and that would make sense to move into IE
2011-07-14T08:09:25  <simonstewart> Yeah, it should be moved into the IE driver C++ code
2011-07-14T08:09:36  <simonstewart> But I've never really got round to it
2011-07-14T08:09:49  <jimevans> That would make sense.
2011-07-14T08:09:52  <simonstewart> Yeah, there's se1 code that modifies registry setting
2011-07-14T08:10:05  <jimevans> I figured it had to be a registry setting for IE.
2011-07-14T08:10:55  <simonstewart> Right. Running the tests.

2011-07-14T08:18:46  <xirkus> anyone care to elaborate why RenderedWebElement went away? I upgraded to the official 2.0 release and noticed a few changes including this one.
2011-07-14T08:20:09  <jimevans> xirkus: most of the methods no longer made sense to have on a separate interface.
2011-07-14T08:20:19  <melter> adamgoucher: good job on the "smattering" blog posts
2011-07-14T08:20:59  <melter> i wish more open source projects would do those
2011-07-14T08:21:04  <jimevans> between the Advanced User Interactions API, and the movement of common code up to the WebElement interface, it wasn't needed.

2011-07-14T08:21:06  <xirkus> jimevans: thanks; I suspected as much. How about setSelected, getValue, and toggle on the WebDriver interface? Any reason why these were deprecated/moved?
2011-07-14T08:21:09  *** dawagner has joined #selenium
2011-07-14T08:21:14  <adamgoucher> thanks. the twitter stream has been awfully polluted recently with the whole 2.0 release thing
2011-07-14T08:21:32  * adamgoucher uses the smattering posts as personal online bookmarks :)
2011-07-14T08:21:47  <jimevans> getValue was deprecated in favor of getAttribute("value").
2011-07-14T08:21:51  <melter> they remind me of the old "kernel cousin" newsletters, if anyone remembers those
2011-07-14T08:21:52  <simonstewart> xirkus: They weren't needed
2011-07-14T08:22:34  <simonstewart> toggle was exactly the same as "click"
2011-07-14T08:22:49  <xirkus> perfect. thanks guys. I was curious to know what superceded the old getValue. The other methods I could see the reasoning behind.
2011-07-14T08:22:58  <simonstewart> And "setSelected" wasn't used that much: people kept using click
2011-07-14T08:23:04  <simonstewart> :)
2011-07-14T08:23:06  <xirkus> as did I.
2011-07-14T08:23:20  <simonstewart> So we followed the principle of least surprise
2011-07-14T08:23:25  <simonstewart> and made click Do The Right Thing
2011-07-14T08:23:36  <xirkus> cool. thanks simonstewart.
2011-07-14T08:23:56  <jimevans> using click for <option> elements in IE sucks, by the way.
2011-07-14T08:23:57  <simonstewart> np
2011-07-14T08:24:04  <simonstewart> how so?
2011-07-14T08:24:19  <jimevans> you can't use a native click. you have to simulate it.
2011-07-14T08:24:31  <simonstewart> That's suboptimal
2011-07-14T08:24:34  <jimevans> the option element *never* has width or height in IE.
2011-07-14T08:25:01  <simonstewart> The sooner this is MS's problem, the better
2011-07-14T08:25:07  <jimevans> yeah, it plays hell with select boxes using jQuery.
2011-07-14T08:25:21  <jimevans> can't happen soon enough for me.
2011-07-14T08:25:57  <simonstewart> Is there some event we're missing to make jquery happy?
2011-07-14T08:26:38  <jimevans> I can't seem to tell. firing the onchange event of the <select> doesn't satisfy it.
2011-07-14T08:27:05  <jimevans> though calling the jquery equivalent of fireEvent does.
2011-07-14T08:27:06  <simonstewart> Ugh.
2011-07-14T08:27:12  <simonstewart> Double ugh
2011-07-14T08:27:15  <simonstewart> FFS.
2011-07-14T08:27:19  <jimevans> i mean, don't get me wrong, i've really updated my c++ skills working on the IE driver, but IE's quirks are murder ffs.
2011-07-14T08:27:28  <simonstewart> Why doesn't partialLinkTextMatchTest pass?
2011-07-14T08:27:40  <simonstewart> jimevans: we'll get there
2011-07-14T08:27:49  <jimevans> on ie?

2011-07-14T08:40:10  <simonstewart> k
2011-07-14T08:40:17  <simonstewart> First question: is maven mandatory?
2011-07-14T08:40:19  <Parabola> the documentation is non existant on m2e's page
2011-07-14T08:40:31  <simonstewart> Right. Which is the reason for my first question :)
2011-07-14T08:40:35  <Parabola> simonstewart: nope, it was referenced here: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html
2011-07-14T08:40:47  <simonstewart> OK. First off, then, don't use maven
2011-07-14T08:40:52  <Parabola> haha, sweet

2011-07-14T08:49:58  <acroyear2> When running a suite from the Se 2.0.0 commandline with *firefox, it will run individual test cases fine but it won't run the whole suite in one go - it always stops after the first one

2011-07-14T08:50:55  <simonstewart> Parabola: in that case, I'd use eclipse too

2011-07-14T09:01:51  <adamgoucher> you could convert your xpath to css
2011-07-14T09:02:06  <adamgoucher> you could not use selenese

2011-07-14T09:19:36  <simonstewart> It'll be in the javascript.rb file
2011-07-14T09:19:51  <simonstewart> I think you just need to turn on all the optimizations and avoid pretty printing
2011-07-14T09:19:59  <jimevans> (I've researched everything I know to track down the performance issues with IE, and the only thing I can think is that it's be cause IE's JS engine is shit)
2011-07-14T09:20:09  <simonstewart> well, yes
2011-07-14T09:20:39  <simonstewart> Nice. Nokia came out on the selenium user list that they're using webdriver
2011-07-14T09:21:03  <adamgoucher> antlong: so w/ 2.0.0 jar i can get the browser to launch with -htmlSuite without .html as the filenames
2011-07-14T09:21:15  <jimevans> There are a number of gross inefficiencies in the IE driver C++ code, but they don't contribute to the performance problems (sub-millisecond impact)
2011-07-14T09:21:23  <adamgoucher> (it doesnt work, but it launches)
2011-07-14T09:21:38  <simonstewart> What's the performance like between IE9 32 and 64 bit?
2011-07-14T09:21:40  <antlong> adamgoucher yeah it opens the browser before it knows about the test files afaik
2011-07-14T09:21:47  <simonstewart> That should provide some interesting evidence
2011-07-14T09:22:49  <adamgoucher> ouch -         int timeout = 60 * 15; // fifteen minutes

2011-07-14T09:24:33  <simonstewart> Does it matter these days?
2011-07-14T09:24:47  <adamgoucher> apparently since people are still logging bugs against it
2011-07-14T09:24:47  <simonstewart> 15 minutes to run a test suite doesn't sound like a terrible estimate to me
2011-07-14T09:24:53  <simonstewart> *sigh*
2011-07-14T09:25:14  <jimevans> simonstewart: i've not run specific diagnostics, but the poor-performing test with the RichFaces application we had the discussion about on the dev list took 30% of the time on x86 that it did on x64

2011-07-14T10:06:43  <adamgoucher> is_element_present?
2011-07-14T10:07:01  <elew> is that a method?

2011-07-14T11:02:34  <adamgoucher> <--- takes no credit for webdriver
2011-07-14T11:03:10  <antlong> adamgoucher you should go over stale elements, and other similar implementation problem prone to beginner things
2011-07-14T11:04:05  <adamgoucher> dunno if i have ever used the term 'stale elements' but i suspect thats in actions -> synchronization
2011-07-14T11:05:02  <antlong> its an exception
2011-07-14T11:05:21  <antlong> i believe because things are cached, and if it changes, the cache is not broken automatically
2011-07-14T11:06:23  <adamgoucher> guessing this is a webdriver-y thing. but i would further argue that if you ever hit this then your sychro is busted

2011-07-14T11:09:28  <adamgoucher> doesnt mean there are not a tonne of people with poor synch :)

2011-07-14T11:11:17  *** stepheneb has joined #selenium
2011-07-14T11:12:31  <adamgoucher> looks like element staleness in webdriver is the logical equiv of is_element_present and is_visible

2011-07-14T11:37:09  <RossPatterson> adamgoucher: Have you been following the discussion on selenium-users between Freddy Vega, Samantha Heck, and Krishnan Mahadevan, with occasional commentary by Andy Tinkham and me?  I'm finding it interesting as a set of fresh eyes looking at page objects.
2011-07-14T11:37:58  <adamgoucher> a little bit. theres lots of words in some of the posts :)
2011-07-14T11:38:00  <jimevans> sonuvabitch, i hate jquery.
2011-07-14T11:38:00  <RossPatterson> The "stale object" thing is a WebDriver issue, it has nothing to do with page objects.
2011-07-14T11:38:28  <RossPatterson> adamgoucher: Yup, but still probably worth scanning.  At least, worth scanning a lot more than the average selenium-users posts :-)
2011-07-14T11:38:50  <RossPatterson> jimevans: Could be worse - there's GWT and ExtJS!
2011-07-14T11:39:07  <adamgoucher> well, it has to do with them in so much that your page objects should handle synch and stale objects are a smell of synch problems
2011-07-14T11:40:00  <jimevans> RossPatterson: ExtJS, I have under control. At least everything there is an effing <div>.
2011-07-14T11:40:08  <RossPatterson> Agreed.  But they're an implementation detail - POs in Selenium RC don't have that sort of problem.

2011-07-14T11:41:02  <adamgoucher> sure they do; its just Exception(elemtnn not found) rather than StaleElementException
2011-07-14T11:41:39  <jarib> jimevans: you mean firing onchange on an element doesn't trigger a jquery change() handler?

2011-07-14T11:50:51  <jimevans> that script does not refresh the page when you call fireEvent, but does when you use the jQuery change() event.
2011-07-14T11:51:24  <jarib> IE's fireEvent?
2011-07-14T11:51:29  <jimevans> yep.

2011-07-14T12:31:27  <QAguy> I'm using switch_to.frame to access the frame
2011-07-14T12:32:44  <jarib> that sounds like the right way to do it
2011-07-14T12:33:18  <algard`> driver.switchTo().defaultContent();  driver.switchTo().frame(frameID);
2011-07-14T12:33:40  <algard`> after those i've not had any problem finding things in iframes or real frames
2011-07-14T12:33:53  <QAguy> I can access the fame but then when I try to find elements it say it can't find them but I can see them in the html of the frame. Can't figure why it can't see them
2011-07-14T12:34:21  <QAguy> I assume that once I have accessed the frame I remain in the frame until I leave it?
2011-07-14T12:36:18  <jarib> that's right
2011-07-14T12:37:40  <QAguy> Hmmmm ok so at least I know I'm proceeding in the right direction. Ok I'll work with my front end dev to see if I can't figure out what I might be missing. Thanks as always Jari. And if are every going to be in YC let me know and I'll buy you that beer I owe you. :)

2011-07-14T13:08:05  <autojack> I just spent a long time coding up something that would help me confirm the presence of an element like this: <td title=" Foo " style="width: 120px;" role="gridcell">
2011-07-14T13:08:22  <autojack> *NOW* I realize that I can't locate an element by 'title' attribute.
2011-07-14T13:08:25  <autojack> argggg.
2011-07-14T13:09:09  <jimevans> autojack: xpath or css selector won't let you find a td with attribute title?
2011-07-14T13:09:56  <autojack> I've never used css selectors. I usually try to avoid xpath because I find them to be brittle.
2011-07-14T13:10:08  *** cburroughs has quit IRC
2011-07-14T13:10:37  <jimevans> in general, they are. but you should be able to start with a well-known parent element that would decrease the brittleness.
2011-07-14T13:14:50  <ian_mac_> I don't think xpath per se is brittle, it's choosigg your xpath wisely IMO
2011-07-14T13:17:36  <autojack> yeah, I hear you
2011-07-14T13:17:41  <autojack> I think I need a little primer on xpaths
2011-07-14T13:18:12  <autojack> how can I figure out a well-known parent element?
2011-07-14T13:18:34  *** pavelko has joined #selenium
2011-07-14T13:19:04  <jimevans> how were you intending to find the td element in the first place?
2011-07-14T13:19:21  <autojack> I was assuming I could locate it by title
2011-07-14T13:19:29  <autojack> that was my plan
2011-07-14T13:21:04  <jarib> i don't get this "xpath is brittle" thinking, the problem is people copy-pasting from some xpath tool that includes the full path from the root node
2011-07-14T13:21:42  <jimevans> then you're golden. your xpath would look like "//td[@title='foo']" and the CSS selector would look like "td[title='foo']"
2011-07-14T13:22:11  <ian_mac_> jarib - well, that's probably in part due to Selenium IDE
2011-07-14T13:22:32  <jimevans> i avoid xpath because it's slow in ie.
2011-07-14T13:22:40  <jimevans> and probably always will be.
2011-07-14T13:22:41  <jarib> that's a good reason
2011-07-14T13:22:48  <jarib> that's not "brittle"
2011-07-14T13:22:54  <ian_mac_> no
2011-07-14T13:23:09  <jimevans> yes, i was imprecise in my earlier statement.
2011-07-14T13:23:49  <ian_mac_> how slow is xpath in IE?
2011-07-14T13:24:30  <jarib> autojack: actually it should be //td[@title=' Foo '] - space/case matters
2011-07-14T13:25:14  <jimevans> jarib: yes, I was using foo metaphorically. i'd already forgotten that autojack had used foo in his example
2011-07-14T13:25:31  <jarib> :)
2011-07-14T13:25:45  <jimevans> ian_mac_: an order of magnitude slower than firefox, in some cases.
2011-07-14T13:25:52  * jarib feels pedantic
2011-07-14T13:25:58  <jimevans> IE's javascript engine is Just. That. Slow.
2011-07-14T13:27:33  <autojack> excellent. let me try the xpath then
2011-07-14T13:27:43  <autojack> or would the css be better? does it matter?
2011-07-14T13:27:52  <autojack> this will be Firefox only.
2011-07-14T13:28:09  <jimevans> then it probably doesn't matter.
2011-07-14T13:28:20  <jimevans> whichever you're more comfortable with.
2011-07-14T13:32:37  <ian_mac_> but are tests usually selector speed bound?

2011-07-14T13:33:29  <jimevans> they can be. depends on the test. IE JS performance really is that bad.

2011-07-14T13:34:31  <ian_mac_> I thought it was improving
2011-07-14T13:34:39  <jimevans> ian_mac_: ie9 is a special case.
2011-07-14T13:34:44  <ian_mac_> ha
2011-07-14T13:34:52  <jimevans> it's better, but the improvements are only for 32-bit IE.
2011-07-14T13:35:02  <ian_mac_> oh rly?
2011-07-14T13:35:03  <jimevans> 64-bit IE got no Chakra javascript engine love.

2011-07-14T13:35:22  <jarib> huh, they use a different JS engine on 64-bit?
2011-07-14T13:35:45  <jimevans> that's my understanding.
2011-07-14T13:36:10  <jarib> wow, as if people didn't have enough trouble making their web pages work in various browsers already
2011-07-14T13:37:05  <ian_mac_> When compare to Chrome, Opera and Firefox, JavaScript performance is better in Internet Explorer 10. Regarding security in Internet Explorer 10, Microsoft has added HTML5 Sandbox and frame isolation support to the browser. Apart Internet Explorer 10, Google Chrome has also sandbox security.
2011-07-14T13:38:00  <jarib> do they link to the benchmarks?
2011-07-14T13:38:11  <ian_mac_> no

2011-07-14T13:53:12  <autojack> the point is that the title is going to be dynamic.
2011-07-14T13:53:23  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: so was that photo from earlier just your mid-day wander down to the beach?
2011-07-14T13:53:37  <autojack> but it sure looks to me like I'm formatting the locator correctly.
2011-07-14T13:53:46  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: yup

2011-07-14T13:54:25  <autojack> maybe I'mm try css.
2011-07-14T13:54:36  <autojack> *I'll
2011-07-14T13:54:49  <jarib> autojack: see if contains() works like adamgoucher suggested
2011-07-14T13:55:12  <jarib> e.g. those could be non-breaking spaces
2011-07-14T13:56:27  <autojack> how can you have nbsp's in the HTML itself? isn't that a display char?
2011-07-14T13:56:49  <autojack> I'm wondering more if it's the '' that are screwing me up
2011-07-14T13:56:53  <autojack> because I'm trying to pass in a var
2011-07-14T13:57:11  <autojack> I'm doing: @driver.find_element(:css, "td[title='#{comp_names}']").displayed?
2011-07-14T13:57:25  <autojack> where #{comp_names} is the expected title.
2011-07-14T13:58:00  <autojack> maybe I should remove the ''
2011-07-14T13:58:21  <jarib> stick with xpath and try contains()
2011-07-14T13:59:12  <autojack> ok
2011-07-14T13:59:13  <AutomatedTester> right i am off
2011-07-14T13:59:15  <AutomatedTester> laters
2011-07-14T13:59:16  <jarib> a nbsp is just a sequence of bytes, it could end up in an attribute, yes.
2011-07-14T13:59:24  <autojack> definitely didn't like the removal of '' :)
2011-07-14T13:59:42  <adamgoucher> (you could always look at the application source code to see what it is doing)
2011-07-14T14:00:20  <ian_mac_> a good qa person doesn't need application source

2011-07-14T14:01:53  <adamgoucher> i'm all about flamebait :)
2011-07-14T14:02:07  <autojack> still unable to locate
2011-07-14T14:02:26  <autojack> Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//td[contains(@title=' Comp 1310677915 ')]"}
2011-07-14T14:02:32  <jarib> that's not the correct syntax
2011-07-14T14:02:40  <jarib> look at what adamgoucher gave you earlier
2011-07-14T14:03:13  <autojack> oh you actually want me to munge the variable before I insert it
2011-07-14T14:04:04  <jarib> as an intermediate step to figure out what the problem is, yes
2011-07-14T14:04:09  <autojack> nod
2011-07-14T14:04:28  <jarib> also, you have = where you want a comma
2011-07-14T14:05:02  <adamgoucher> i find firefinder for firefox a useful plugin for trouble shooting this sort of stuffs
2011-07-14T14:06:47  <autojack> jarib: NOW you tell me. ;)
2011-07-14T14:06:49  * autojack re-runs
2011-07-14T14:07:50  <autojack> presto!
2011-07-14T14:07:59  <autojack> man that would have jacked me up big time.
2011-07-14T14:08:10  <autojack> so do I just need to use &nbsp ?
2011-07-14T14:08:27  <autojack> or something?
2011-07-14T14:08:44  * autojack looks up firefinder
2011-07-14T14:08:45  <jarib> not sure
2011-07-14T14:09:04  <jarib> but it seems like those spaces aren't the same as in your variable
2011-07-14T14:09:09  <autojack> yeah
2011-07-14T14:09:12  <jarib> what does .text on the element return?
2011-07-14T14:09:49  <jarib> webdriver's .text isn't guaranteed to match the xpath engine, but still..
2011-07-14T14:11:56  <jarib> uhm, i mean .attribute(:title), not .text
2011-07-14T14:12:48  <autojack> I'm playing with firefinder
2011-07-14T14:12:56  <autojack> it definitely does not find it with the spaces around it.
2011-07-14T14:13:23  <autojack> but it also doesn't like //td[contains(@title, '&nbsp;Comp 1310677086&nbsp;')]
2011-07-14T14:13:29  <adamgoucher> jimevans: if you dont watch out your twitter stream will start to look like mine :)
2011-07-14T14:13:55  <jarib> autojack: those entities won't work, you need the actual byte sequence
2011-07-14T14:13:59  <autojack> mmm
2011-07-14T14:14:10  <jarib> but you don't know if that's the problem
2011-07-14T14:14:11  <adamgoucher> jimevans: but what we likely need is a 'here is how you use the browsermob proxy to get that stuff if you really need it -- but you probably dont'
2011-07-14T14:14:14  <autojack> yeah.

2011-07-14T14:17:08  <autojack> actually maybe not. but

2011-07-14T14:24:05  <autojack> or find_elements(:xpath, '//li) and then iterate for .text

2011-07-14T14:41:51  <autojack> the //li locator worked!
2011-07-14T14:41:59  <autojack> man that was painful.

2011-07-14T14:42:49  <jimevans> more seriously, i'd love to see it happen, but I know the leaders of the IE team by reputation, and a contribution to an open-source project while they (read: Dean Hachamovitch) are in charge is unlikely in my opinion.
2011-07-14T14:43:07  <jimevans> though i'd love to be proven wrong.
2011-07-14T14:43:27  <antlong> anyone in the new york area?
2011-07-14T14:44:08  <jimevans> I'm rather more interested in apple's involvement.
2011-07-14T14:44:25  <jimevans> i really really really want to see a safari driver.

2011-07-14T14:47:18  <AutomatedTester> i wanna see safari die
2011-07-14T14:47:23  <AutomatedTester> but thats just me
2011-07-14T14:48:08  <jimevans> i don't blame you, but i don't see that happening anytime soon.
2011-07-14T14:48:09  <jimevans> :)
2011-07-14T14:48:41  <autojack> I switched to Safari from Firefox when Firefox got to be ridiculous with Flash. watching Youtube videos on a <1 year old Mac always involved skips/stutters.
2011-07-14T14:49:17  <AutomatedTester> autojack: I, read we at Mozilla, feel your pain
2011-07-14T14:49:18  <autojack> I tried Chrome last year but scrapped it because I hate the god damned "Other Bookmarks" folder that is permanently affixed to the bookmarks bar :)
2011-07-14T14:49:20  <AutomatedTester> and are working on it
2011-07-14T14:49:49  <autojack> AutomatedTester: glad to hear it :)  my good friend just started on the security team there.
