2011-03-25T04:44:29  * RossPatterson hears banjos in the distance.
2011-03-25T04:44:57  <adamgoucher> whats the equivilant of the banjo for people in england?
2011-03-25T04:45:09  <AutomatedTester> a banjo
2011-03-25T04:45:34  <RossPatterson> Dunno, but it would probably be played by Gyspies.  Or the Irish.
2011-03-25T04:45:56  <AutomatedTester> a banjo is a banjo
2011-03-25T04:45:59  <RossPatterson> Oh, sure, musically.  But the cultural implications are ... um ... slightly "low caste" :-)
2011-03-25T04:46:01  <AutomatedTester> we have them in the UK too
2011-03-25T04:46:29  <adamgoucher> for some reason i thought the banjo has an 'american' instrument
2011-03-25T04:46:31  <AutomatedTester> ok... dunno what you mean
2011-03-25T04:46:48  <AutomatedTester> my wifes grandfather had several banjos
2011-03-25T04:47:52  <AutomatedTester> in the UK if someone is moaning over something trivial we go "I can hear the smallest violin in the world playing"
2011-03-25T04:48:47  <AutomatedTester> but I am hardly one to comment on british metaphors like that being a foreigner
2011-03-25T04:48:58  <RossPatterson> Over in the States, banjos are largely either novelty instruments (e.g., a few prominent folksingers like Pete Seeger, some really old (or dead) country guys like Flatt & Scruggs), or "hillbilly music".  "Hillbilly" isn't a nice thing to call someone, even if they are one.  Implications of poor hygine, inbreeding, and illiteracy abound.
2011-03-25T04:49:36  <RossPatterson> Yeah, that "smallest violin" thing is common here too.  Of course, adamgoucher only shares the continent with us Yanks, not the culture :-)
2011-03-25T04:49:38  <AutomatedTester> so RossPatterson, 70% of americans are hillbillies?
2011-03-25T04:49:42  <RossPatterson> LOL
2011-03-25T04:49:49  <RossPatterson> Seems like it some days :-)
2011-03-25T04:49:54  <AutomatedTester> hehehe
2011-03-25T04:50:20  * AutomatedTester heard somewhere that 60% of americans never leave their state in their lifetime
2011-03-25T04:50:35  <adamgoucher> and an even higher amount never get a passport
2011-03-25T04:50:50  <AutomatedTester> never get a passport is something like 80%
2011-03-25T04:51:44  <RossPatterson> Perhaps.  And yet, we're a nation of immigrants.  The US Census released data yesterday that claims  25% gains in immigrant populations since 10 years ago.
2011-03-25T04:52:52  <RossPatterson> And a study in the 1980s found that half of Americans had a close connection to Brooklyn, NY (a traditional stopping point for immigrants) - either having lived there themselves or having a very close relative who did.
2011-03-25T04:53:20  <RossPatterson> Interesting stuff.
2011-03-25T04:53:37  <AutomatedTester> in the UK people complain about immigratants stealing jobs/welfare but I read somewhere that they only make up 10% of the population
2011-03-25T04:54:14  <AutomatedTester> and tbh, the people complaining are lay abouts anyway
2011-03-25T04:54:18  <RossPatterson> Same complaints here, mostly by folks whose grandparents or great-grandparents were immigrants.
2011-03-25T04:54:31  <AutomatedTester> the irony
2011-03-25T04:56:22  <AutomatedTester> i am sure that in the US, like the UK, its fuelled by trashy sensationalist tabloids
2011-03-25T04:56:38  <AutomatedTester> that the people complaining read and take as gospel
2011-03-25T04:56:41  <RossPatterson> Ayuh.
2011-03-25T04:57:29  <AutomatedTester> a friend and I would love to enter UK politics and remove all welfare unless you can prove you really need it
2011-03-25T04:58:08  <AutomatedTester> and if you couldnt prove you needed it and still wanted it, move you to an island just off the UK where you have to live and fend for yourself
2011-03-25T04:58:17  * RossPatterson just got a Guru Meditation number from Slashdot's cache.  Does it run on an Amiga?!?
2011-03-25T04:59:41  <AutomatedTester> I truelly hate that this project is cross platform sometimes
2011-03-25T04:59:42  <selbot2> theautomatedtester half a minute ago - DavidBurns fixing temp folder access for named profiles in Firefox - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11809
2011-03-25T05:00:09  <AutomatedTester> my poor MBP struggles when I run builds for all OS at the same time
2011-03-25T05:02:09  <RossPatterson> Hmm ... that might have been a problem even without cross-platform issues.  gettempdir() isn't defined as to whether it ends with the directory separator or not.
2011-03-25T05:02:41  <adamgoucher> says the internet, the banjo actually originates from africa. hmmm.
2011-03-25T05:03:03  * RossPatterson believes everything on the intarwebs.
2011-03-25T05:03:22  <adamgoucher> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo actually makes sense in this case
2011-03-25T05:03:50  <AutomatedTester> RossPatterson: thats why I am now doing a path join instead of a concat
2011-03-25T05:04:02  <AutomatedTester> nevermind path join is better practise :)
2011-03-25T05:04:09  <RossPatterson> AT: Yup and yup.
2011-03-25T05:04:16  <RossPatterson> ag: Yup.
2011-03-25T05:04:23  <RossPatterson> OK, so just "yup".
2011-03-25T05:04:35  <AutomatedTester> 3 yups === HELL YEA!
2011-03-25T05:05:37  <AutomatedTester> btw that concat works on Windows and Mac but fails on Linux
2011-03-25T05:06:32  <AutomatedTester> because it tries to build at / instead of /tmp/

2011-03-25T05:50:18  <simonstewart> Greetings fellow mortals
2011-03-25T05:50:34  <jimevans> hi, simonstewart!
2011-03-25T05:50:52  <jimevans> i'm glad to see you, actually, as i have an api semantics question.
2011-03-25T05:51:09  <simonstewart> Go for it
2011-03-25T05:51:38  <jimevans> suppose you have a driver instance with one window open. you call driver.close().
2011-03-25T05:51:55  <simonstewart> There's a test for this
2011-03-25T05:51:58  <jimevans> the api docs indicate that it should behave as if you called driver.quit().
2011-03-25T05:52:02  <simonstewart> Right
2011-03-25T05:52:34  <jimevans> so if, after i call driver.close(), i subsequently call driver.quit(), what should i expect?
2011-03-25T05:52:46  <simonstewart> Calling quit on a closed session is a no-op
2011-03-25T05:52:55  <simonstewart> There's also a test for that somewhere
2011-03-25T05:52:56  <simonstewart> I think
2011-03-25T05:53:19  <jimevans> ok. that answers that question then. looks like i've got my work cut out for me.
2011-03-25T05:53:38  <simonstewart> How so?
2011-03-25T05:53:55  <jimevans> i'm trying to bring the ie driver in line with those semantics, but it poses some challenges with the .net bindings and proper disposal of resources.
2011-03-25T05:54:11  <simonstewart> Damnable resources
2011-03-25T05:54:16  <jimevans> (though come to think of it, java might have the same challenges)
2011-03-25T05:54:30  <simonstewart> We end up releasing resources in finalizers
2011-03-25T05:54:34  <simonstewart> which isn't elegant
2011-03-25T05:54:39  <simonstewart> And may not always work
2011-03-25T05:54:53  <simonstewart> :yt if i had a boat james vincent mcmorrow
2011-03-25T05:54:54  <selbot2> James Vincent McMorrow - If I had a Boat - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2XPDP6KkkE&feature=youtube_gdata
2011-03-25T05:55:29  <jimevans> right. the .net bindings implement the IDisposable pattern, but i've not got the logic quite right yet.
2011-03-25T05:55:35  <AutomatedTester> g'day simonstewart
2011-03-25T05:55:39  <AutomatedTester> how was cukeup?
2011-03-25T05:55:43  <simonstewart> Ace

2011-03-25T05:56:28  <simonstewart> jarib was there too
2011-03-25T05:56:54  <AutomatedTester> jarib would say its good because of the ruby factor...

2011-03-25T05:57:32  <AutomatedTester> only core contributor I havent met now is jimevans
2011-03-25T05:57:52  <simonstewart> I need to meet jimevans too
2011-03-25T05:57:56  <jimevans> and that happens in what, 10 days? 11?
2011-03-25T05:57:56  <simonstewart> and kristian rosenvold

2011-03-25T05:58:06  <AutomatedTester> oh yea and krosenvold
2011-03-25T05:58:07  <simonstewart> Really looking forward to it
2011-03-25T05:58:22  <jimevans> me too.
2011-03-25T05:58:29  <ahfeel> jimevans: hi ! :)
2011-03-25T05:58:32  * AutomatedTester is off to a flying start to try get closer to the top
2011-03-25T05:58:43  <ahfeel> jimevans: I tested with the ruby bindings, and still got the same js error
2011-03-25T05:58:44  <jimevans> hi, ahfeel.
2011-03-25T05:59:36  <jimevans> ok
2011-03-25T06:02:55  <ahfeel> jimevans: the error comes from this file, http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/branches/shared_js/common/src/js/bot/locators/strategies/strategies.js?r=8551
2011-03-25T06:03:38  <ahfeel> and it seems that the lookupMany function retrieves a key "inherits" instead of "name" or something like that
2011-03-25T06:04:13  <jimevans> if you insist.
2011-03-25T06:04:23  <ahfeel> because it throws Unsupported locator strategy: Inherits
2011-03-25T06:05:43  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: quick question about RemoteWebDriver and renderedwebelement stuff
2011-03-25T06:05:50  <simonstewart> go for it
2011-03-25T06:06:13  <AutomatedTester> if I do size when directly binding to the browser i get a dict with height and width
2011-03-25T06:06:33  <AutomatedTester> with remote webdriver I get hCode and I assume a ref to DImension
2011-03-25T06:06:39  <ahfeel> jimevans, simonstewart: any idea ? :(
2011-03-25T06:06:48  <AutomatedTester> what is the extra info
2011-03-25T06:07:01  <simonstewart> Firefox?
2011-03-25T06:07:03  <AutomatedTester> {u'width': 32, u'hCode': 131072, u'class': u'org.openqa.selenium.Dimension', u'height': 32}

2011-03-25T06:08:46  <jimevans> ahfeel: i see nowhere in the code called by the ie driver where we attempt to call a locator named 'Inherits'
2011-03-25T06:09:57  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: Take a look at the "getElementSize" function defined in wrappedElement.js
2011-03-25T06:10:04  <simonstewart> That only returns width and height
2011-03-25T06:10:13  <simonstewart> Are you sure you're not using the remote server?
2011-03-25T06:10:24  <AutomatedTester> i am using the remote server
2011-03-25T06:10:31  <AutomatedTester> when I do I get the extra info
2011-03-25T06:10:38  <AutomatedTester> when I dont I only get height width
2011-03-25T06:11:13  <ahfeel> jimevans: ok :( simonstewart any hint ?
2011-03-25T06:11:31  <simonstewart> ahfeel: I've not been paying attention. A quick summary?
2011-03-25T06:11:31  <AutomatedTester> why the difference
2011-03-25T06:11:45  <jimevans> simonstewart: ahfeel is having a problem calling findElement using By.name.
2011-03-25T06:11:51  <simonstewart> Take a look at the GetElementSize class
2011-03-25T06:11:53  <ahfeel> simonstewart: still the IE driver By.name() issue while the By.xpath works
2011-03-25T06:11:59  <simonstewart> it returns a "element.getSize"
2011-03-25T06:12:01  <jimevans> when I test using the same page and same code, it works for me.
2011-03-25T06:12:03  <ahfeel> and we figured out that we had a JS error on IE
2011-03-25T06:12:10  *** monk12 has joined #selenium
2011-03-25T06:12:13  <ahfeel> that jimevans does not have, exact same code and same site
2011-03-25T06:12:15  <simonstewart> Which returns one of our Dimension objects
2011-03-25T06:12:30  <ahfeel> and the error is Unsupported locator strategy: Inherits
2011-03-25T06:12:30  <simonstewart> Including width and height
2011-03-25T06:12:40  <ahfeel> Thrown by http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/branches/shared_js/common/src/js/bot/locators/strategies/strategies.js?r=8551
2011-03-25T06:12:41  <simonstewart> But because it doesn\t have a "toJson" method it gets serialized
2011-03-25T06:13:18  <simonstewart> You can safely discard any fields not mentioned in the wire protocol doc
2011-03-25T06:13:28  <simonstewart> What's the method call?
2011-03-25T06:14:20  <ahfeel> simonstewart: well, stacktraces and IE :-/ I just know that the error is thrown when doing By.name("login")
2011-03-25T06:14:27  <ahfeel> I have a pastie for you, wait
2011-03-25T06:14:35  <simonstewart> that'd be handy
2011-03-25T06:14:41  <ahfeel> simonstewart: http://pastie.org/1708546
2011-03-25T06:14:54  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: ok, i will ignore. its only that Anthony raised a bug about it
2011-03-25T06:15:18  <simonstewart> We need to add a section to the wire protocol saying that additional fields should be ignored
2011-03-25T06:15:28  <AutomatedTester> cool
2011-03-25T06:15:41  <ahfeel> simonstewart: the call line 36 fails here, but works perfectly for jimevans
2011-03-25T06:15:50  <simonstewart> ahfeel: that code looks fine to me
2011-03-25T06:16:10  <simonstewart> On my Mac, so need to hunt for the C# code
2011-03-25T06:16:14  <simonstewart> One moment please caller
2011-03-25T06:16:25  <jimevans> simonstewart: i've tried it in several language bindings, and it works for me in all of them...
2011-03-25T06:16:45  <simonstewart> Yeah. That's a pretty well tested code path
2011-03-25T06:16:55  <simonstewart> ahfeel: which version are you using? 2.0b3?
2011-03-25T06:16:56  <ahfeel> jimevans, simonstewart: but the ruby code also fails for me
2011-03-25T06:17:02  <ahfeel> simonstewart: yeah, the trunk from a few days ago
2011-03-25T06:17:38  <jimevans> my working theory is that there's a javascript error that's short-circuiting the execution of the findElement with By.name.
2011-03-25T06:17:58  <jimevans> but it's only a hypothesis at this point.
2011-03-25T06:18:07  *** nirvdrum has joined #selenium
2011-03-25T06:18:20  <simonstewart> Sounds unlikely
2011-03-25T06:18:37  <simonstewart> The finding's been atomized in the IE driver, right?
2011-03-25T06:18:42  <jimevans> me too, but i'm grasping at straws. i can't get the damn thing to fail.
2011-03-25T06:18:49  <jimevans> yes, for awhile now.
2011-03-25T06:18:59  <simonstewart> That's what I thought
2011-03-25T06:19:19  <simonstewart> ahfeel: can you get the code to fail when using the atoms directly?
2011-03-25T06:19:39  <simonstewart> I can walk you through testing them
2011-03-25T06:19:40  <jimevans> we don't use the atom for xpath or css selectors, of course.
2011-03-25T06:19:42  <ahfeel> simonstewart: huh, atoms ? :>
2011-03-25T06:19:56  <simonstewart> Heh.
2011-03-25T06:19:59  <ahfeel> oh by the way
2011-03-25T06:20:03  <simonstewart> WebDriver uses a series of layers
2011-03-25T06:20:15  <ahfeel> it worked well with a7 or b1 can't remember

2011-03-25T06:20:24  <simonstewart> The bottom-most one (when querying the DOM) are the automation atoms

2011-03-25T06:22:54  <adamgoucher> that would be an /ideal/ place to put ideas for students

2011-03-25T06:23:05  <_du> Hi all. Sorry for probably stupid question, but if i need to automate testing of .net app should use c#+nunit framework? or it's possible to use java+junit for example for testing .net apps?
2011-03-25T06:23:22  <gtailleb> i'll check the automation atoms and see where it leads
2011-03-25T06:23:26  <simonstewart> OK
2011-03-25T06:23:29  <adamgoucher> that gives me, 6 weeks?
2011-03-25T06:23:35  <ahfeel> gtailleb: allright
2011-03-25T06:23:36  <simonstewart> Roughly
2011-03-25T06:23:39  <simonstewart> ish
2011-03-25T06:24:17  <adamgoucher> seems do-able-ish :)
2011-03-25T06:24:26  <simonstewart> Thought I'd give you a heads up :)
2011-03-25T06:24:27  <adamgoucher> crap! forgot my headphones at home
2011-03-25T06:24:33  <simonstewart> I know you've been pretty busy
2011-03-25T06:24:58  <RossPatterson> _du: It's your choice.  My usual advice is "use the language and platform you (or your organization) are most comfortable with."  So here, we write our app in C# on .NET and we also write our tests in C#.  Others here will recommend tests written in Python or Ruby for ease of coding,
2011-03-25T06:24:59  <simonstewart> If we get it to work, by 2.0b5 we'll have a fully operational deathstar

2011-03-25T06:25:59  <jimevans> my favorite kind of meeting: a cancelled one.
2011-03-25T06:26:20  <simonstewart> Great poster
2011-03-25T06:26:39  <RossPatterson> _du: ..., and also because test-developers are often a different team with different skills from the app-developers.
2011-03-25T06:26:44  <ahfeel> jimevans: sometimes it's also the most efficient one :)
2011-03-25T06:26:54  <_du> RossPatterson: oh great, thanks a lot for you answer. I just thought that tests language/platform should be the same as app. I do not know c# at all, but right now i was moved to this project. So it'd be much easier for me to use java and python instead.
2011-03-25T06:27:35  <AutomatedTester> sometimes I really hate python...
2011-03-25T06:27:42  <RossPatterson> _du: Short answer: Selenium tests don't care what language the app is written in because the browser isolates the tests from the app.
2011-03-25T06:28:09  <AutomatedTester> statically typed languages give you the easy of spotting syntax errors before that code is built
2011-03-25T06:28:33  * RossPatterson is not discounting the value of compiled code.  We <3 C# :-)
2011-03-25T06:29:24  <ahfeel> simonstewart: got any chance to test the provided code ?
2011-03-25T06:29:33  <_du> RossPatterson: thanks, clear for me now.

2011-03-25T08:03:28  <ahfeel> jimevans: Hey, calm down, i'm convinced it doesn't, there must be something wrong elsewhere, just telling the atoms all passes

2011-03-25T08:39:47  <shawn42> andytinkham: thanks, I'm looking for the xpath ".//svg" (as seen by turning $DEBUG on)
2011-03-25T08:39:57  <shawn42> it doesn't find it
2011-03-25T08:40:21  <shawn42> if I get its parent element and search for "*" it returns the svg element
2011-03-25T08:40:28  <shawn42> so it really seems like a bug in the driver
2011-03-25T08:40:31  <adamgoucher> wouldnt you jsut want //svg ?
2011-03-25T08:41:04  <shawn42> adamgoucher: ideally, yes.  But I'm using webdriver through capybara => selenium webdriver
2011-03-25T08:41:15  <monk12> hello all, i was curious, is there a way to simulate pressing Tab in the firefox plugin? i saw the selenium code to do it, but I want to just have a firefox seleniumm testcase vs a programmed java selenium testcase
2011-03-25T08:41:20  <shawn42> capybara generates the xpath ".//svg", which should still be valid

2011-03-25T09:57:22  <andytinkham> (My goal is to alleviate some latent anti-open source bias in an internal talk I'm giving today - there's some people who feel like it must be a lesser used tool or completely unsupported or something like that.)

2011-03-25T09:59:28  <antlong> imo the best approach is to explain what open source is, then explain how its flexible, modifiable, etc
2011-03-25T09:59:30  <andytinkham> Basically, I've got enough trust to get away with saying "This is the tool we should use" and having people go with it, but I'd also like to show them that there are a lot of places using the tool - we're not striking off completely on our own either.

2011-03-25T10:16:23  <monk12> adamgoucher, so keyup sets what locater element to send key up to... and keySequence... if 'n'  should be in the type() command, what keySequence should keyUp do on that input field?
2011-03-25T10:16:34  <shawn42> the second line I pasted works for you in firebug on taht page?

2011-03-25T10:17:03  <antlong> shawn42, i didnt run that. use the command i said in webdriver and see if its works.
2011-03-25T10:17:16  <antlong> svg:* is valid
2011-03-25T10:17:43  <monk12> gotcha... so then another quest: does typeKeys() do any of these keyPress/keyUp events when it is typing and hence keyUp is not needed if using that to type  Johnathan?

2011-03-25T10:19:20  <adamgoucher> monk12: for that i think you want sendKeys. but certain characters don't always work (which was one of the prime motivators for merging with webdriver)

2011-03-25T10:24:04  <shawn42> antlong: the reason I'm asking if "svg:*" worked for you in firefox.. is because I looked at the JS that the driver uses in FF and it is the document.evaluate that I pasted above
2011-03-25T10:24:24  <shawn42> but the webdriver for chrome may work with that xpath
2011-03-25T10:24:52  <antlong> shawn42, did you look at by_xpath?
2011-03-25T10:25:45  <shawn42> findElementByXpath calls into execute .. which calls into document.evaluate in the firefoxdriver.js

2011-03-25T10:40:15  <antlong> shawn42, and also install firepath
2011-03-25T10:40:31  <antlong> youll see that //svg is not valid xpath
2011-03-25T10:41:49  <antlong> (hint, svg:*)
2011-03-25T10:42:23  <shawn42> antlong: installing firepath... one sec
2011-03-25T10:42:32  * adamgoucher cant decide if he needs to figure out how to clear the cookie or just kill any running iexplore sessions before launching one. hmm.
2011-03-25T10:42:58  <antlong> adamgoucher, did you try to delete by name
2011-03-25T10:43:43  <adamgoucher> nope. the docs imply that delete_all is the hammer

2011-03-25T10:45:50  <andytinkham> Is anyone here aware of any known problems between Selenium, and Bundler or cellophane/cucumber? (Particularly with regards to running Firefox on Windows)?
2011-03-25T10:46:23  <shawn42> antlong: looks like firepath is just a nice wrapper around what I was already doing with document.evaluate, can you point me to the specific page that says svg is not valid xpath?
2011-03-25T10:46:33  <antlong> yeah. put it in the box and hit enter.

2011-03-25T10:49:44  <shawn42> antlong: interesting... "//*[name()='svg']" works
2011-03-25T10:50:00  <antlong> name is a valid tag name
2011-03-25T10:50:30  <antlong> thats the equivalent of [//[contains(@name, 'svg')]
2011-03-25T10:51:24  <shawn42> name isn't an attribute in my example but a function that returns the name of the tag
2011-03-25T10:51:43  *** esteele has quit IRC
2011-03-25T10:52:49  <antlong> shawn42, ok and if you wanted that to be useful, you would do the above xpath
2011-03-25T10:53:31  <shawn42> antlong: your xpath above didn't run, is there a typo in there?
2011-03-25T10:53:40  *** esteele has joined #selenium
2011-03-25T10:54:08  <antlong> shawn42, this is getting old. why dont you just use what you know works? ie find_element_by_tag_name
2011-03-25T10:54:29  <antlong>  //svg is not going to work, i assure you of that.
2011-03-25T10:54:57  <shawn42> I have it working, thanks for your help. I'm just working on expanding my understanding of xpath and possibly why //svg is different than //*[name()='svg']
2011-03-25T10:55:04  <shawn42> antlong: thanks again

2011-03-25T10:57:14  <antlong> shawn42, the short answer: firefox's xpath engine cant handle default namespaces in documents
2011-03-25T10:57:42  <antlong> adamgoucher, heh. im thankful every day i dont have to use windows.
2011-03-25T10:59:01  <adamgoucher> antlong: i normally dont have to, but we've got a small chunk of windows-y functionality to check. and turns out the flaky runs were due to me having an ie window already logged in

2011-03-25T13:29:40  <jleyba_> the located element or null
2011-03-25T13:29:47  <jimevans> i ask because on ie8 and below, it looks like it returns a javascript object, not an element.

2011-03-25T13:31:19  <jleyba_> Interesting
2011-03-25T13:31:38  <jimevans> yeah, what's really odd is that it just seems to work on simple pages.
2011-03-25T13:32:08  <jimevans> on more complex pages (like say using jquery), it fails being unable to find the element.

2011-03-25T13:32:49  <jimevans> ie9 works great.
2011-03-25T13:32:56  <jleyba_> jquery shouldn't have an effect unless it's patching the document object
2011-03-25T13:33:13  <adamgoucher> jarib: yup
2011-03-25T13:34:18  <jimevans> agreed there, but the unit tests pass on all versions of ie, so i've no clue what the actual problem factor is.
2011-03-25T13:34:52  <jimevans> nevertheless, i know that if i inspect the object returned by the findElement atom in ie8's dev console, it most assuredly isn't an element.
2011-03-25T13:35:05  <jleyba_> what does it look like?

2011-03-25T13:41:46  <nirvdrum> jarib: Have you considered using excon at all?
2011-03-25T13:42:00  <antlong> jimevans, what gets built when you pass in a string to a find method
2011-03-25T13:42:43  <jarib> nirvdrum: don't know it - what are the benefits?
2011-03-25T13:43:17  <jarib> it's pretty simple to swap out the HTTP client
2011-03-25T13:43:19  <nirvdrum> I've found it to be more stable than net/http and it seems to handle pipelining better.
2011-03-25T13:43:45  <nirvdrum> I might fork and try it out.
2011-03-25T13:44:02  <nirvdrum> I see an inordinate number of client timeouts and I'm not sure if it's net/http  or me.
2011-03-25T13:44:29  <jarib> did that happen after 0.1.4?
2011-03-25T13:44:48  <nirvdrum> Nope.
2011-03-25T13:44:53  <jarib> i'm looking for a way to reproduce #1439
2011-03-25T13:44:54  <selbot2>  open/needsclarification selenium-webdriver 0.1.4 gem causes timeout errors - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1439
2011-03-25T13:44:55  <jarib> ok
2011-03-25T13:44:56  <nirvdrum> I'm still on 0.1.3 actually.
2011-03-25T13:45:02  <nirvdrum> And it was a problem for me before that.
2011-03-25T13:45:11  <nirvdrum> Going back to the older gem.

2011-03-25T13:45:12  <jarib> what commands time out?
2011-03-25T13:45:46  <jarib> and is this for RC or webdriver?
2011-03-25T13:45:57  <nirvdrum> RC
2011-03-25T13:46:07  <jarib> ahh
2011-03-25T13:46:13  <nirvdrum> And basically any of them.  It could be grid at play.
2011-03-25T13:46:15  <nirvdrum> I'm not really sure.
2011-03-25T13:46:26  <nirvdrum> But I've noticed oddities with long-lived http connections before.
2011-03-25T13:46:40  <nirvdrum> The obvious downside to excon is it's an extra depedency.
2011-03-25T13:46:46  <jarib> yep
2011-03-25T13:47:14  <jarib> so, on the webdriver side, we use net/http by default but make it easy to swap in other HTTP clients
2011-03-25T13:47:32  <jarib> and i have implementations for curb and net-http-persistent included even though those aren't dependencies

2011-03-25T13:48:30  <jarib> doesn't seem crazy to do something similar for RC
2011-03-25T13:48:33  <nirvdrum> Gotcha.
2011-03-25T13:48:34  <jarib> especially if it's grid-only
2011-03-25T13:48:57  <nirvdrum> Well, the client would be RC in general.
2011-03-25T13:49:04  <nirvdrum> Nothing would bind that directly to grid.
2011-03-25T13:49:07  *** freynaud has joined #selenium
2011-03-25T13:49:15  <nirvdrum> That's just the environment I have the most experience in.
2011-03-25T13:49:34  <jarib> right, i mean if net/http works great outside grid, the extra dep seems unneccessary
2011-03-25T13:49:43  <nirvdrum> Oh, right.
2011-03-25T13:49:46  <nirvdrum> Yeah, I just don't know.
2011-03-25T13:49:56  <nirvdrum> I don't run a production set up with taht.
2011-03-25T13:50:03  <nirvdrum> I really doubt it's grid-specific.
2011-03-25T13:50:25  <nirvdrum> I think it's likely a combo of net/http kinda being a piece of crap and EC2 networking not being all that great.
2011-03-25T13:52:30  <jarib> right
2011-03-25T13:52:55  <jarib> let me know if excon helps
