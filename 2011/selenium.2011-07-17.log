2011-07-17T09:10:17  *** Gregor has quit IRC
2011-07-17T09:10:32  <oaror> I recently upgraded to the latest and greatest selenium 2 and have found that there seems to have been a change in the api for selecting options
2011-07-17T09:11:59  <oaror> the following doenst work any longer '''wd.find_element_by_xpath("//select/option[@value='Canada']" ).select()'''
2011-07-17T09:12:35  <oaror> I get an error saying '' 'AttributeError: 'WebElement' object has no attribute 'select' '''
2011-07-17T09:13:01  <oaror> What is the new way to select option values from webelement objects.?
2011-07-17T09:13:41  <oaror> Any ideas?. Please get back. thanks.

2011-07-17T09:15:08  <oaror> I can see from '''print dir(w)''' where w is a webelement object that the select method does not exist
2011-07-17T09:16:11  <oaror> However before my update the api had that method....
2011-07-17T09:22:30  <oaror> I have also read this http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html#user-input-filling-in-forms
2011-07-17T09:22:40  <oaror> But I dont see  a set_selected methd
2011-07-17T09:23:43  <oaror> I am using the python bindings with selenium-2.0.1

2011-07-17T11:56:05  <ato> cerberos: xvfb opens an additional display in your X server, which you run Firefox in.
2011-07-17T11:57:29  <cerberos> ato: well, yes. But it can be hidden. Do I just install the 'normal' firefox to do this?

2011-07-17T21:31:20  <chson> Anybody know if I'm using the AjaxElementLocatorFactory correctly?  The test isn't waiting for this page to load.  http://pastebin.com/MQXAuMRQ
2011-07-17T21:38:48  <tancnle> AjaxElementLocatorFactory only waits for elements annotated with @FindBy upon interactions
2011-07-17T21:40:10  <chson> tancnle: I have a @FindBy in the class.  I guess that means I should check to see if it's a really valid element.
2011-07-17T21:40:19  <tancnle> are you waiting for ajax requests or visibility of any elements on the page?
2011-07-17T21:41:09  <chson> tancnle: I'm just waiting for the page to load.  These particular elements are not ajaxy at all.
2011-07-17T21:43:22  <tancnle> using Firebug > Net, you can't see any XHR request?
2011-07-17T21:46:28  <chson> tancnle: I do but your questions lead me to believe that I'm using the wrong tool for the job.  What I'm ultimately trying to do is just slow down the "Dashboard" pagefactory so that I can logout before the @AfterClass does a driver.close().

2011-07-17T21:57:58  *** admc has joined #selenium
2011-07-17T22:02:08  <chson> tancnle: I think I narrowed down the problem a little bit.  I commented out the AjaxElementLocatorFactory stuff, removed the junit Asserts,  and now I'm getting the NoSuchElementException.  I'll throw in a Thread.sleep() and see what happens.
2011-07-17T22:08:04  <chson> tancnle: ok looks like the root of the problem is that I'm not even logging in.  I was using WebElement password.click() instead of password.submit().

2011-07-17T22:08:30  <tancnle> you can try to use WebDriverWait and/or implicitlyWait while polling for presence of the webelement
2011-07-17T22:08:39  <tancnle> pleasure mate
2011-07-17T22:09:20  <chson> tancnle: is WebDriverWait generally a good idea for non ajaxy elements?  or should I attempt to use the ajaxlocatorfactory for all elements?
2011-07-17T22:12:29  <tancnle> i don't think it is going to be a definite answer, there are times where i found i need to use both
2011-07-17T22:13:44  <chson> tancnle: alright, thanks again for talking me through this.

2011-07-17T22:26:07  <tancnle> chson: Considering my limited knowledge of the library, these are the steps I use
2011-07-17T22:26:07  <tancnle> 1. Use PageFactory with timeouts to initialise webelements. This step will lazily loaded all elements to proxy - not concrete class. And once you interact with those elements i.e click, getAttribute then webdriver will wait for the look up and timeout as per value you set earlier
2011-07-17T22:26:07  <tancnle> 
2011-07-17T22:26:07  <tancnle> 2. Invoke a common method called waitForPageLoad in the base page (which include draining XHR request or waiting for a specific webelement to be displayed using JavascriptExecutor and WebDriverWait
2011-07-17T22:31:30  <chson> tancnle: great, I was also thinking of sticking some type of Wait in the parent Page class.  Right now I think AjaxElementLocatorFactory might actually be working though.. need to confirm by adding more @FindBy elements.
