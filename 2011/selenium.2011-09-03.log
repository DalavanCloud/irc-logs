2011-09-03T07:49:22  <Ajay> i was seeing the doc of Math.abs  which says Note that if the argument is equal to the value of Integer.MIN_VALUE, the most negative representable int value, the result is that same value, which is negative
2011-09-03T07:51:16  <Fyrespray> some tests are failing for me locally but I don't know if thats because it's not a fully working build or I haven't set it up right :)
2011-09-03T07:51:54  <Ajay> Fyrespray: which tests
2011-09-03T07:52:32  <Fyrespray> the firefoxdrivertestsuite

2011-09-03T07:58:34  <Fyrespray> but they are failing on a clean checkout of trunk so grabbing the tag right now
2011-09-03T07:58:36  <jarib> what tests specifically?
2011-09-03T07:58:39  <Ajay> i read somewhere u r a musician , any performance videos ?

2011-09-03T07:59:42  <jarib> and they should be passing on trunk

2011-09-03T09:17:51  <Siph0n> Is there a way to have selenium (1) tests run minimized ? I have two screens, and when i have my selenium browser open on one screen, and I use the other screen for instant messaging, it always hits the enter key on my messages to focus on the other window (I think thats whats happening anyway).
2011-09-03T09:20:58  <Siph0n> my other solution would be to have another computer be my selenium server (not sure this is possible at my work), or run it in a virtual machine on my computer (which my work laptop only has 2GB ram and not sure it would work well with a virtual machine.

2011-09-03T09:24:50  <Siph0n> well my other problem with that is, I think my work would have to give me another windows license to install on the VM? Or I could use a linux distro.... how much ram do you have?
2011-09-03T09:25:25  <eghm> There is also Oracle VM Virtual box, which think is free
2011-09-03T09:25:55  <barnex> If I'm using Selenium to drive test on remote machines using selenium grid, where would screenshots be saved? On the machines, that actually run tests?
2011-09-03T09:26:53  <eghm> barnex: last year, with version 1, I hacked it up to do screen shots, but once i ran under the grid, i only got screenshots of the grid server
2011-09-03T09:27:06  <Siph0n> eghm, yea the virtual software is free, but the windows license is not.
2011-09-03T09:28:01  <barnex> Siph0n: If you are talking about windows VM to run IE for testing, I think ms gives them for free
2011-09-03T09:28:26  <barnex> at least https://github.com/xdissent/ievms says so
2011-09-03T09:29:34  <eghm> oh yeah, good idea, heard about that yesterday
2011-09-03T09:29:56  <eghm> i got 3G Ram, but have done it with 2G 1G for OS and 1G for VM

2011-09-03T11:01:36  <CCulver> nice, thanks jarib
2011-09-03T11:02:15  <CCulver> not bad pricing
2011-09-03T11:02:32  <CCulver> but my framework essentially does the same thing
2011-09-03T11:03:03  <CCulver> oh, whats the blocker for 2.6?
2011-09-03T11:03:34  <sdf> will someone answer me
2011-09-03T11:04:07  <jarib> CCulver: not sure if there are any
2011-09-03T11:04:14  <jarib> sdf: only if they know the answer to your question.

2011-09-03T11:06:28  <cgoldberg> sdf, we are not paid support, nor are we mind readers :)
2011-09-03T11:06:56  <sdf> thanks for unpaid support
2011-09-03T11:07:13  <jarib> sdf: your problem sounds like a very basic java/eclipse issue, not a selenium issue
2011-09-03T11:07:25  <jarib> sdf: you may have more luck in #java or on a java mailing list
2011-09-03T11:08:36  <cgoldberg> sdf,   can you run a regular "hello world" app from your eclipse setup?  make sure your java setup is working at least... main class not found is like java 101
2011-09-03T11:13:16  <sdf> i asked the damn bustards
2011-09-03T11:13:20  <sdf> and they had no idea
2011-09-03T11:14:18  <cgoldberg> ?

2011-09-03T12:37:16  <barnex> Ok, I can't find this anywhere in the grid docs, does grid share selenium-server interface?
2011-09-03T12:38:30  <barnex> I'm trying to connect to my hub using ruby api and I get 404
2011-09-03T12:38:52  <barnex> with url "http://myserver:4444/wd/hub", I'm pretty sure that's the one I used previously without grid

2011-09-03T12:39:49  <mweichert> hello, I'm trying to use selenium-webdriver to automate an app. I need to get the HTML of a WebElement object. Is this possible?
2011-09-03T12:40:32  <eghm> mweichert: you can get the source of the whole page
2011-09-03T12:40:59  <mweichert> eghm: as interpreted by the DOM?
2011-09-03T12:42:04  <eghm> ah... well idk for sure about 2.0 in 1.0 you don't get it via DOM, if it was already interpreted or not i'm nost sure

2011-09-03T12:57:22  <barnex> there's example using Selenium::Client::Driver not Selenium::Webdriver
2011-09-03T12:57:33  <barnex> I guess that's the selenium 1 interface
2011-09-03T12:58:37  <barnex> the constructor doesn't require url, instead it gets hostname and port of the hub
2011-09-03T13:00:52  <jarib> mweichert: yes, current DOM is Selenium::WebDriver::Driver#page_source
2011-09-03T13:01:07  <mweichert> jarib: thanks
2011-09-03T13:01:42  <jarib> mweichert: you can also use execute_script if you want to get properties from a single element
2011-09-03T13:02:04  <jarib> e.g. driver.execute_script("return arguments[0].innerHTML", some_element)
