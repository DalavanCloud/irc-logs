2011-02-11T00:33:52  <dereke_> dimkin: you can use selenium to drive a browser, so fill in a form and click submit, if you want to do posts directly then you need to use another library

2011-02-11T05:07:47  <skip> Hey,  does there exist a specification for the -Denvironment setting for RC?  What is allowed and what each option does?
2011-02-11T05:09:56  <RossPatterson> skip: I've never seen one, but I've puzzled some of the -Dwhatever's out.
2011-02-11T05:10:11  <skip> Especially some expansion on the "Custom" option.  Also how is that environment parsed?
2011-02-11T05:10:34  <RossPatterson> Oh, you mean the "*custom" browser specification?
2011-02-11T05:10:56  <skip> RossPatterson.  Did you happen to put your puzzling in the selenium wiki?
2011-02-11T05:11:09  <skip> Well, *custom and others.
2011-02-11T05:11:35  <RossPatterson> No, but I did write it down.
2011-02-11T05:11:48  <rohitOSS> < skip>
2011-02-11T05:12:10  <skip> Specifically I would like to a have Selenium RC client that doesn't start any browser, just runs python code on the remote system.
2011-02-11T05:12:34  <skip> Hey rohitOSS
2011-02-11T05:12:53  <skip> Are you addressing me?  Or just learning IRC?
2011-02-11T05:13:20  <rohitOSS> :)  learning IRC
2011-02-11T05:13:30  <skip> np
2011-02-11T05:13:35  <rb2k> this seems to be the Selenium RC doc for ruby: http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-remote-control/1.0-beta-2/doc/ruby/classes/Selenium/Client/GeneratedDriver.html   I can't seem to find any method that would allow me to inspect the results of an xpath expression
2011-02-11T05:13:40  <skip> (np = "no problem")
2011-02-11T05:14:02  <rohitOSS> the __init__ method for selenium module requires the browserStartCommand to create the newBrowserSession
2011-02-11T05:14:25  <rohitOSS> so not really sure if it allows to "not" pass a broswer command
2011-02-11T05:14:26  <RossPatterson> Hmm ... that's an odd request.  You'd need some sort of "browser", because RC doesn't actually push things to the remote system - instead the browser asks it "what do I do next?"
2011-02-11T05:14:37  *** Putr|Away is now known as Putr
2011-02-11T05:15:30  <RossPatterson> rb2k: Depends on what you think of as the "results" of an XPath expression.  Do you mean you want to get the set of matching elements?
2011-02-11T05:15:39  <rb2k> a bunch of result nodes
2011-02-11T05:15:41  <skip> It would be nice to start a non-browser test on a remote desktop the same way I can start a browser test
2011-02-11T05:15:41  <rb2k> or anything
2011-02-11T05:15:43  <rohitOSS> AFAIK, a browser command is mandatory because that is the whole purpose of selenium
2011-02-11T05:15:51  <rohitOSS> yes ,.,it would be nice
2011-02-11T05:15:54  <rb2k> my problem is that I get a hit using the get_xpath_count method
2011-02-11T05:15:59  <skip> Have a central one stop hub for testing
2011-02-11T05:16:10  <rb2k> but when I want to get an attribute of that result, it crashes
2011-02-11T05:16:21  <rb2k> so I'd love to see what that result actually is (--> the html of it)
2011-02-11T05:16:54  <rohitOSS> does anyone know how to change the profile of the default *chrome browser that RC launches
2011-02-11T05:17:22  <rohitOSS> i need to use my own profile from my firefox browser that contains useful plugins like firebug etc..
2011-02-11T05:17:52  <rb2k> RossPatterson: my current problem are these two lines
2011-02-11T05:17:59  <rb2k> puts @browser.get_xpath_count	("(//div[@id='content-area']//div[@class='media-gallery-item']//a[@class='media-gallery-thumb'])[1]")
2011-02-11T05:18:00  <rb2k> puts @browser.get_text		("(//div[@id='content-area']//div[@class='media-gallery-item']//a[@class='media-gallery-thumb'])[1]")
2011-02-11T05:18:08  <rb2k> the xpath expressions are exactly identical
2011-02-11T05:18:19  <rb2k> line one returns "1"
2011-02-11T05:18:33  <rb2k> line two errors out with "ERROR: Element (//div[@id='content-area']//div[@class='media-gallery-item']//a[@class='media-gallery-thumb'])[1] not found"
2011-02-11T05:19:07  <RossPatterson> skip: You could write your own pseudo-browser program, but it would have to send HTTP requests to the RC server sending the results of the most recent command and asking for the next.  That's what RemoteRunner.html and all of the .js files it loads do.
2011-02-11T05:19:27  <skip> Interesting
2011-02-11T05:20:49  <RossPatterson> skip: The "*custom" browser spec would let you do that.  "*custom /usr/local/bin/skipsWhizbangPseudoBrowser" would launch it.
2011-02-11T05:22:39  <RossPatterson> rb2k: There isn't a general way to dump the HTML of a node selected by an XPath.  When debugging things like this, I usually use the Firefox "xpather"
2011-02-11T05:22:50  <rb2k> it works in firefox
2011-02-11T05:22:52  <rb2k> that's my problem
2011-02-11T05:23:11  <RossPatterson> ... extension, which can show you an XPath that leads to the element, and can evaluate other XPaths as well.
2011-02-11T05:23:37  <rohitOSS> does selenium dump the html data onto the browser or does the browse render the http requests??
2011-02-11T05:23:58  <RossPatterson> Selenium uses Firefox's XPath engine - the expression will evaluate the same in FF and in Se.
2011-02-11T05:27:00  <RossPatterson> rb2k: That's an unusual XPath expression you're using.  You're asking get_xpath_count() to count the number of elements that match an expression that deliberately matches only one element.
2011-02-11T05:28:40  *** esteele has joined #selenium
2011-02-11T05:29:53  <RossPatterson> rohitOSS: You can change the template for the default profile that RC creates, you can supply your own template for that profile, or you can override which profile gets.  There are options on the JAR file to control that.  "java -jar selenium-server.jar -help" will show them to you.
2011-02-11T05:31:30  <RossPatterson> rohitOSS: The browser does all the heavy lifting, aided in no small part by JavaScript code supplied by Selenium RC.  The RC server itself merely acts as a communication channel between the test script and the browser, albeit a somewhat intelligent one.

2011-02-11T05:33:01  <rb2k> RossPatterson: only in this case

2011-02-11T05:33:19  <rb2k> I'm just trying that out
2011-02-11T05:33:22  <RossPatterson> rb2k: Cool.  Had to ask :-)
2011-02-11T05:33:36  <rb2k> yeah, just to make sure it's working and retuning the correct number of results
2011-02-11T05:33:43  <rb2k> since there is no iterator over them
2011-02-11T05:34:56  <rohitOSS> Ross: the -profilesLocation switch accepts the profiles directory path as argument
2011-02-11T05:35:10  <RossPatterson> rb2k: Normally what you're doing involves get_xpath_count("//something/or/other") followed by a loop of "get_text("(//something/or/other)[...position...]") - note the lack of "(..)[1]" in the first call.
2011-02-11T05:35:35  <rohitOSS> so can i give my ~/.mozilla/firefox/<some_directory> ?
2011-02-11T05:35:37  <rb2k> yeah, that's what I'm trying
2011-02-11T05:35:42  <rb2k> maybe there was a typo though
2011-02-11T05:36:41  <RossPatterson> rohitOSS: What do you really want to do?  Most people asking this question really want to know how to get RC to launch Firefox with their favorite extension loaded (typically Firebug).
2011-02-11T05:37:02  <rohitOSS> yes thats what i asked
2011-02-11T05:41:52  <rohitOSS> sorry my bad
2011-02-11T05:42:01  <RossPatterson> rohitOSS: I think you want the "-firefoxProfileTemplate ...directoryname..." option.  That will cause RC to copy the directory you specify each time as the profile it launches Firefox.  That way each FF will come up with a clean profile (i.e. not disturbed by prior FF launches), but it will start with what your directory contains, instead of starting with nothing.
2011-02-11T05:42:02  <rohitOSS> it's worked for me....the correct switch is
2011-02-11T05:42:07  <rohitOSS> -firefoxProfileTemplate
2011-02-11T05:42:40  <rohitOSS> thanks ross..i overlooked that switch the first time around
2011-02-11T05:43:13  <RossPatterson> That's easy to do :-)
2011-02-11T05:43:42  <skip> so does the -firefoxProfileTemplate affect profiles for googlechrome and opera too?
2011-02-11T05:44:00  <RossPatterson> skip: Nope, just Firefox.  It's kind of an oddity in RC.
2011-02-11T05:45:21  <RossPatterson> There is no similar facility for Opera (RC just barely tolerates Opera as a non-custom browser).  I don't know about Chrome.
2011-02-11T05:47:30  <skip> ok

2011-02-11T06:05:39  <rb2k> ok, so now each of these elements has a hyperlink embedded among their children
2011-02-11T06:05:54  <balou> because it currently takes ~20 min to run all our tests, and this will probably go up significantly with the amount of testing we'd like to do

2011-02-11T06:06:35  <rb2k> gal_url = @browser.get_attribute("(//div[@id='content-area']//div[@class='media-gallery-item']//a[@class='media-gallery-thumb'])[#{i}]@href")
2011-02-11T06:06:57  <rb2k> this should get all of the items, select number i (according to the loop) and extract the href attribute
2011-02-11T06:07:20  <rb2k> the problem is that while firefox + chrome seem to work fine with that xpath expression
2011-02-11T06:07:24  <rb2k> selenium says it can't find it

2011-02-11T06:11:53  <sdf> one more question
2011-02-11T06:12:13  <sdf> how can i read values from csv file using selenium ide
2011-02-11T06:13:25  <sdf> i know it is silly easy question but would appreciate help

2011-02-11T06:15:01  <rohitOSS> ide is used only for record and playback
2011-02-11T06:15:10  <rohitOSS> i dont think u can verify content against external files
2011-02-11T06:17:36  <rohitOSS> u need to export your test case in another language format and then modify it to use the csv file
2011-02-11T06:18:00  <AutomatedTester> sdf, you cant read files like rohitOSS says
2011-02-11T06:18:08  <rohitOSS> run the test using RC
2011-02-11T06:18:36  <sdf> yes but isn't it possible to replace values in HTML
2011-02-11T06:18:53  <AutomatedTester> sdf, with what?
2011-02-11T06:18:59  <sdf> make the code read from table instead of being one static value
2011-02-11T06:19:13  <sdf> like you have e-mail field
2011-02-11T06:19:21  <rohitOSS> sdf: i beleive what you mean is data-driven testing
2011-02-11T06:19:36  <sdf> to read from table where e-mails are stored
2011-02-11T06:19:42  <sdf> not one by one
2011-02-11T06:19:44  <rohitOSS> IDE does not support that level of tests, you would need to use RC
2011-02-11T06:19:54  <sdf> :( ok
2011-02-11T06:19:54  <AutomatedTester> sdf: you cant do inject values from a file into IDE
2011-02-11T06:20:07  <AutomatedTester> you need to use a turing complete language for that

2011-02-11T06:37:31  <RossPatterson> rb2k: Are you certain the elements don't have any other CSS classes?  XPath doesn't provide an easy way to say "class xxx, even if there are other classes".  Most folks seem to use "contains(@class, 'xxx')", although it's a little incorrect (i.e., if "xxx" occurs within the name of another class, it will match).
2011-02-11T06:37:54  <rb2k> they do have other classes
2011-02-11T06:38:00  <rb2k> but the count works too

2011-02-11T08:35:21  <nirvdrum> What's up?
2011-02-11T08:35:32  <skip> Question just above.

2011-02-11T08:36:01  <skip> Shall I repost?
2011-02-11T08:36:05  <nirvdrum> I see it.
2011-02-11T08:36:14  <nirvdrum> I think you need to pass as SELENIUM_ARGS.
2011-02-11T08:36:15  <skip> merci
2011-02-11T08:36:18  <nirvdrum> Let me double-check.
2011-02-11T08:37:18  <skip> by the way, is there an official place for documentation of this sort of thing?  I would be happy to put some of what I learn in a wiki.
2011-02-11T08:38:32  <nirvdrum> -DseleniumArgs='-ensureCleanSession -noBrowserSessionReuse'
2011-02-11T08:38:35  <nirvdrum> Something like that.
2011-02-11T08:38:53  <nirvdrum> We use the wiki at http://selenium.googlecode.com/, as terrible as it is.
2011-02-11T08:39:50  <skip> I will try to jump on there and document some stuff

2011-02-11T08:44:37  <nirvdrum> Sorry, I think you misunderstood.  Anything that you would normally pass to Selenium Server must be contained in seleniumArgs.
2011-02-11T08:44:47  <nirvdrum> I just gave you -ensureCleanSession as an example.

2011-02-11T08:57:14  <skip> I think it is going to automate either a large portion or nearly all of our core testing

2011-02-11T08:58:54  <skip> for the "nearly all" I will need a specific feature enhancement that might be rather small.

2011-02-11T08:59:29  <nirvdrum> We're working on grid 2.0.  Feel free to file an issue for a feature request.
2011-02-11T09:00:17  <skip> Would it be understandable to say "I would like to run a non browser test"
2011-02-11T09:00:32  <nirvdrum> Nope ;-)
2011-02-11T09:00:33  <skip> I know selenium is browser testing
2011-02-11T09:01:22  <skip> But if I could launch an arbitrary python program I could centralize another large chunk of our test effort
2011-02-11T09:02:02  <skip> Robot Framework automates nicely, but doesn't do the multi system stuff like grid.
2011-02-11T09:03:16  <dereke> skip: are you using a build server to coordinate your testing?
2011-02-11T09:03:28  <skip> Not yet, but we will be
2011-02-11T09:03:49  <nirvdrum> skip: The new grid might actually facilitate that.
2011-02-11T09:03:56  <dereke> because if you use one then you can launch whatever you like from there, selenium can just be another target you test on
2011-02-11T09:03:59  <nirvdrum> Albeit you'd need to write your own adapters.
2011-02-11T09:04:03  <skip> It looks like it almost does now
2011-02-11T09:04:37  <skip> It seems like I can start a browser session, then ignore it to run regular python code.
2011-02-11T09:05:11  <Xtree^> yeah, if you don't need the browser session, it might be better to ... just run the python code
2011-02-11T09:05:54  <skip> But I like the possibility of having hub share out my lab servers on an as needed basis
2011-02-11T09:06:06  <Xtree^> selenium is nice, but it doesn't replace the role of the build server

2011-02-11T11:19:19  <elitecoder> yeah ;x

2011-02-11T11:22:21  <dhackner> ...
2011-02-11T11:22:25  <dhackner> ok so when it's running
2011-02-11T11:22:33  <dhackner> and if you're watching the selenium window
2011-02-11T11:22:55  <dhackner> is there a lag between the php commands running and showing up in the window, or do they show up immediately and then take time to execute
2011-02-11T11:23:16  <dhackner> i.e. where is the delay occurring, the connection or the execution?
2011-02-11T11:24:31  <elitecoder> show up immediately
2011-02-11T11:24:37  <elitecoder> and once finished there's a delay before the next one
2011-02-11T11:25:03  <dhackner> so in this flow-chart
2011-02-11T11:25:32  <dhackner> firstphpcommand-commandbeginsinselenium-commandendsinselenium-nextphpcommand
2011-02-11T11:25:44  <dhackner> the delay is in commandendsinselenium-nextphpcommand
2011-02-11T11:26:28  <dhackner> sure sounds like the execution speed is wacky. can you verify that getSpeed() returns 0 if you run it in the middle of a test?
