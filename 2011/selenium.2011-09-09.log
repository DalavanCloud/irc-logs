2011-09-09T01:44:59  <andreastt> Would it be possible to just cast to Number in the first place, so we could get rid of CapabilitiesSanitizer?

2011-09-09T07:19:10  <cheezy> jarib: i'm back to trying to solve my ie modal dialog problem again.
2011-09-09T07:19:38  <cheezy> jarib: jimevans said I should be able to switchTo().window() to attach
2011-09-09T07:20:15  <cheezy> I don't have the handle to the dialog and if I use the handle to the parent I am unable to find anything on the dialog
2011-09-09T07:21:01  <jimevans> cheezy: you'll need to implement a scheme by which you get the list of window handles before invoking the dialog, invoke it, then get the list of window handles again.
2011-09-09T07:21:08  <jimevans> the extra window handle is the one of the dialog.
2011-09-09T07:21:19  <cheezy> after opening the dialog I only see one handle
2011-09-09T07:22:01  <jimevans> note that there is a subtle race condition in the dialog detection that has yet to be addressed.
2011-09-09T07:22:12  <jimevans> but that race condition should be exceedingly rare.
2011-09-09T07:22:25  <cheezy> I have a test case where it fails every time
2011-09-09T07:22:36  <cheezy> I never see more than one handle
2011-09-09T07:22:42  <jimevans> great. is it one where you can share the page under test?
2011-09-09T07:23:09  <cheezy> yes - I can create a gist if you like?
2011-09-09T07:23:23  <jimevans> it's possible that the detection algorithm for finding the modal dialog is misbehaving.
2011-09-09T07:23:27  <jimevans> please.
2011-09-09T07:24:09  <cheezy> creating it now - the code is ruby
2011-09-09T07:24:37  <jimevans> ruby's fine. i can translate the code into other languages if need be.
2011-09-09T07:25:06  <jimevans> (the beauty of a unified API)

2011-09-09T07:31:17  <jarib> ok
2011-09-09T07:36:26  <cheezy> jarib: i've got the bandwidth today to help find a comprehensive solution to the modal dialogs on ie.  My current client is at a standstill.
2011-09-09T07:36:27  <jimevans> cheezy: works fine for me in my environment. i translated the code into C#, but that shouldn't make a difference.
2011-09-09T07:37:14  <jimevans> after invoking the dialog, i have 2 window handles, i can switch to the dialog, find the close button, and click it to close the dialog.
2011-09-09T07:38:27  <cheezy> very interesting.  That is not at all what is happening here - we've tried this on at least three different systems and always fail.
2011-09-09T07:38:50  <jarib> let me try the ruby script
2011-09-09T07:38:59  <jarib> what IE version?
2011-09-09T07:39:49  <jimevans> now, admittedly, i'm using IE9, on Windows 7.
2011-09-09T07:39:54  <jimevans> (64-bit)
2011-09-09T07:40:03  <cheezy> I have version 9 on my vm. - windows 7 64 as well
2011-09-09T07:40:28  <jimevans> i can tell you where the race condition exists. it's in the C++ code of the IE driver.
2011-09-09T07:41:43  <jimevans> in webdriver::Browser::Wait() (Browser.cpp, line 269), we check for dialogs in our wait function immediately after clicks.
2011-09-09T07:42:22  <jimevans> if the dialog hasn't appeared at the time this check occurs, we will miss the dialog.

2011-09-09T08:07:39  <vince__> this will work, but i am trying to automate it
2011-09-09T08:07:49  <simonstewart> If you've got a top banner that might be adding an extra iframe sometimes
2011-09-09T08:08:04  <vince__> ok ok
2011-09-09T08:08:40  <vince__> is there anyway i can automate this in a loop
2011-09-09T08:09:00  <vince__> if it fails on one frame indedx it can increment it
2011-09-09T08:09:12  <lukeis> you should just locate the iframe instead
2011-09-09T08:09:20  <vince__> also, the top banner is always there
2011-09-09T08:09:35  <simonstewart> But does it always have the same content every time
2011-09-09T08:09:53  <vince__> oh...locate the iframe...using find_element
2011-09-09T08:09:56  <vince__> hm...it may also change
2011-09-09T08:10:08  <lukeis> driver.find_element_by_css_selector("iframe[src^=\"http://www.facebook.com\"]")
2011-09-09T08:10:24  <vince__> wow that looks like some selenium foo

2011-09-09T09:27:16  <Emperorlou> I'm writing a script designer for web browser automation which is capable of using more than one automation framework. I was hoping to use selenium as one
2011-09-09T09:27:16  <Emperorlou> of the frameworks I can support... is there some way I can control the selenium IDE via code?
2011-09-09T09:27:50  <Emperorlou> specifically I need to be able to get commands from the IDE to my java code programmatically
2011-09-09T09:27:52  *** dave_miles_cf has quit IRC
2011-09-09T09:28:20  <Emperorlou> does the selenium IDE provide some sort of interface for control?
2011-09-09T09:28:31  <Emperorlou> other than clicking on buttons
2011-09-09T09:28:55  <adamgoucher> nope. nor really does any firefox extension
2011-09-09T09:29:26  <adamgoucher> why would you want the generated code? you are /much/ better off crafting it by hand in something like a page object
2011-09-09T09:30:13  <Emperorlou> crafting by hand is not better off
2011-09-09T09:30:24  <adamgoucher> well, thats because you are using java :)
2011-09-09T09:30:28  <Emperorlou> I'm better off being able to click where I want and it remembering those commands
2011-09-09T09:31:00  *** berrada has joined #selenium
2011-09-09T09:31:03  <Emperorlou> I have a visual editor for maintaining script with debug tools and such capable of interfacing with any web automation framework
2011-09-09T09:31:21  <Emperorlou> now, I could probably just save my newly created script to a file and have my editor pick it up automatically
2011-09-09T09:31:26  <Emperorlou> but thats kinda annoying
2011-09-09T09:32:48  <Emperorlou> ok, what about picking up clicks performed but not through the IDE?
2011-09-09T09:33:02  <Emperorlou> something I can translate to selenium commands
2011-09-09T09:33:33  <Emperorlou> I gather I'd need some sort of plugin that does much of the same thing the IDE does...but simpler
2011-09-09T09:33:39  <Emperorlou> yea there's no way...
2011-09-09T09:34:03  <lukeis> there is a way to automate IDE... not sure this is what you really want though: http://blargon7.com/2011/04/testing-selenium-ide-with-mozmill/
2011-09-09T09:36:38  <Emperorlou> oh interesting
2011-09-09T09:36:46  <Emperorlou> a testing framework for ff plugs
2011-09-09T09:36:50  <Emperorlou> that could make sense...

2011-09-09T09:37:27  <Emperorlou> so ideally, if I could, from java, hit selenium ide's record button, stop button and get recorded commands, its a win

2011-09-09T13:49:08  <stackedsax> marked as Invalid, but there is an acknowledged problem, judging by the last comment
2011-09-09T13:50:14  <stephend> we've had session issues too
2011-09-09T13:50:22  <stephend> although we haven't tried 2.5.0, even
2011-09-09T13:51:36  <stackedsax> it works pretty well if you only connect one RC to it, though :)
2011-09-09T13:51:44  <stephend> stackedsax: heh
2011-09-09T13:51:50  <stephend> stackedsax: we use py.test with concurrency
2011-09-09T13:51:58  <stephend> so, py.test -n 8, we'll see it
2011-09-09T13:52:06  <stephend> but if we run single-threaded, we don't
2011-09-09T13:52:10  <stephend> not sure if it's the same issue you see
2011-09-09T13:52:29  <stackedsax> yeah, I was fine running multithreaded testng tests, but with only one RC attached to the grid
2011-09-09T13:53:14  <stackedsax> hooked up 15 RC's, ran fine to start and then after about four hours things wouldn't go so well

2011-09-09T14:03:38  <linkslice> One of our infortunate requirement is the use of IE (I know I know) and a kerberos token assigned at machine login.  So I was thinking I could set up selenium on a real windows machine and use selenium to graph this particular application.
