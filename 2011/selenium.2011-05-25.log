2011-05-25T01:42:24  <amitev> hi all
2011-05-25T01:42:52  *** admc has quit IRC
2011-05-25T01:44:41  <amitev> i have a strange issue
2011-05-25T01:44:56  <amitev> i have a test app (written in java) and bat file that starts it
2011-05-25T01:45:14  <amitev> if i connect to the remote machine and run the bat file manually the tests run fine
2011-05-25T01:46:08  <amitev> but if i connect to the remote machine using ssh and execute the tests WebDriver yields that one of the elements is not visible and cannot be manipulated
2011-05-25T01:46:15  <amitev> idea what might be wrong?
2011-05-25T01:47:32  <barancev> amitev: same OS, same browser?
2011-05-25T01:47:47  <barancev> same selenium version?
2011-05-25T01:48:06  <amitev> i talk about the same machine
2011-05-25T01:48:12  <amitev> everything happens on the same machine
2011-05-25T01:48:34  <amitev> but first time i run the test suite manually from double clicking the bat file
2011-05-25T01:48:48  <amitev> the second time i run that bat file through ssh connection
2011-05-25T01:48:51  <barancev> and what is this lement?
2011-05-25T01:49:18  <amitev> it's a link that is displayed on a css modal panel

2011-05-25T01:52:22  <amitev> barancev: even tried with js to scrollIntoView the element
2011-05-25T01:52:24  <simonstewart> Might stick to "ave!" in future
2011-05-25T01:52:25  <amitev> but doesn't help
2011-05-25T01:52:49  <amitev> simonstewart: i dare to ask your mightyness for help
2011-05-25T01:53:05  <barancev> simonstewart: ave!
2011-05-25T01:53:20  <simonstewart> I'm here to help
2011-05-25T01:53:24  <simonstewart> 'sup?
2011-05-25T01:53:52  <barancev> amitev: is it not present or not visible? is panel visible, but link is not?
2011-05-25T01:54:29  <amitev> the element is presented
2011-05-25T01:55:41  <amitev> selenium.isElementPresent() yields true
2011-05-25T01:55:41  <amitev> but RenderedWebElement.isDisplayed() returns false
2011-05-25T01:55:42  <simonstewart> Interesting
2011-05-25T01:55:42  <amitev> simonstewart: is the channel chat logged?
2011-05-25T01:55:42  <simonstewart> Somewhere
2011-05-25T01:55:42  <AutomatedTester> hihi simonstewart
2011-05-25T01:55:42  <amitev> ok i'll pastebin the chat
2011-05-25T01:55:42  <amitev> it's very weird problem
2011-05-25T01:55:42  <Ivog> Question: Should a click on a disabled checkbox not throw an exception
2011-05-25T01:55:42  <barancev> http://selenium.saucelabs.com/
2011-05-25T01:55:57  <simonstewart> Good question
2011-05-25T01:56:07  <amitev> simonstewart: http://pastebin.com/tEtgxS8g here it is
2011-05-25T01:56:10  <simonstewart> A bit of me says "yes", because that's a weird thing to do
2011-05-25T01:56:26  <simonstewart> But a user can click on an checkbox that's disabled with no ill effect
2011-05-25T01:56:47  <amitev> clicking on a disabled checkbox actually has no effect. even the browser does not fire any event
2011-05-25T01:56:51  <Ivog> Right now just nothing happens
2011-05-25T01:56:52  <simonstewart> Sounds like a timing issue
2011-05-25T01:56:55  <AutomatedTester> i would say a click on a disabled checkbox should be a NO-OP
2011-05-25T01:57:07  <simonstewart> Agreed
2011-05-25T01:57:19  <Ivog> Ok
2011-05-25T01:57:29  <simonstewart> amitev: what happens if you bump the implicit timeouts up to (say) 5 seconds?
2011-05-25T01:57:30  <amitev> simonstewart: if i "wait" for element to become visible the wait timeouts
2011-05-25T01:57:58  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: where you at ldnwebgl last night?
2011-05-25T01:57:59  <simonstewart> OK. That's odd
2011-05-25T01:58:05  <simonstewart> I went to XTC
2011-05-25T01:58:12  <simonstewart> Didn't know that there was a ldnwebgl
2011-05-25T01:58:17  <AutomatedTester> ok
2011-05-25T01:58:21  <AutomatedTester> it was in your office
2011-05-25T01:58:23  <AutomatedTester> :D
2011-05-25T01:58:32  <simonstewart> It's a big office :)
2011-05-25T01:58:49  <AutomatedTester> where we had the last selenium meetup in your office
2011-05-25T01:58:51  <AutomatedTester> that room
2011-05-25T01:58:54  <AutomatedTester> with the Astro
2011-05-25T01:58:58  <simonstewart> I have no excuse
2011-05-25T01:59:18  <AutomatedTester> XTC probably has better beer
2011-05-25T01:59:35  <AutomatedTester> i was just asking to see what you thought
2011-05-25T02:00:01  <amitev> i have exaclty the same problem if i start a standalone server on the remote machine and run the tests using RemoteWebDriver
2011-05-25T02:00:09  <barancev> #1610 is closed recently, but I see in comments that only FF and IE were fixed, what about Chrome?
2011-05-25T02:00:09  <selbot2>  closed/fixed WebDriver confuses opacity: 0 with hidden - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1610
2011-05-25T02:00:14  <simonstewart> Is there a reduced test case anywhere?
2011-05-25T02:00:28  <amitev> i'll try to assemble one
2011-05-25T02:00:36  <barancev> I have testShouldBeAbleToClickOnElementsWithOpacityZero failed in trunk for Chrome
2011-05-25T02:00:43  <simonstewart> Thanks
2011-05-25T02:00:49  <amitev> the strange thing is that the element is visible for me eyes :)
2011-05-25T02:01:11  <amitev> and when i manipulate it using javascript i can see the changes (like color and background)
2011-05-25T02:01:25  <barancev> with the reason Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.remote.ErrorHandler$UnknownServerException: Element must be displayed
2011-05-25T02:01:51  <amitev> but it's somehow not visible for WebDriver and RemoteWebDriver.getX() and .getY() return values about -12000
2011-05-25T02:02:05  <Ivog> AutomatedTester: i still have native events test failing on win7 64 ff4. Can i provide info somehow?
2011-05-25T02:02:24  <AutomatedTester> Ivog you here most of today?
2011-05-25T02:02:24  <AutomatedTester> \
2011-05-25T02:02:42  <Ivog> Yea
2011-05-25T02:02:52  <barancev> Ivog: AutomatedTester: I have FF tests failed too on native events and ready to help debugging
2011-05-25T02:03:09  <AutomatedTester> cool, I need to do a blog post about a Mozilla event I did yesterday
2011-05-25T02:03:28  <AutomatedTester> and then will go get my personal laptop, which is Win7 x64 and start looking
2011-05-25T02:03:37  <barancev> and -- of course I'm ready to help with FF4 alert hangs on Win7 in 1.0 API
2011-05-25T02:03:41  <AutomatedTester> unfortunately only have a x86 Win7
2011-05-25T02:03:46  <AutomatedTester> vm on my MBP
2011-05-25T02:04:29  <barancev> I use FF 4.0.1 x32-build on Win7 x64
2011-05-25T02:04:46  <AutomatedTester> barancev: we talking about something thats not native events
2011-05-25T02:04:59  <AutomatedTester> barancev: have you seen #1661
2011-05-25T02:05:00  <selbot2> eran....@gmail.com open/accepted Native events are not working on Firefox 4 - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1661
2011-05-25T02:05:23  <AutomatedTester> moar coffee!!!!
2011-05-25T02:06:03  <barancev> AutomatedTester: yes, I know, there are two thinks that bugs mein FF4 -- 1) native events in 2.0 and 2) hangins alerts in 1.0 API
2011-05-25T02:06:47  <AutomatedTester> barancev: i can't reproduce the hanging alerts on x86
2011-05-25T02:07:23  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester, which version of Windows are you using?
2011-05-25T02:07:28  <AutomatedTester> i kinda know what the problem *may* be... but if I cant reproduce i will be changing code for the sake of changing code
2011-05-25T02:07:29  <simonstewart> It seems to be Win7 only
2011-05-25T02:07:36  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: Win7 x86
2011-05-25T02:07:40  <simonstewart> Interesting
2011-05-25T02:08:00  <AutomatedTester> i ran test_selenium yesterday with Eran and it all passed
2011-05-25T02:08:20  <AutomatedTester> but my vm is only x86
2011-05-25T02:08:58  <AutomatedTester> so will get my personal laptop and try again once I finished my blog post about yesterday
2011-05-25T02:09:05  <barancev> I can help debugging if you tell me where to look for
2011-05-25T02:09:33  <AutomatedTester> barancev: part of the problem is how Firefox treats inner and outer windows
2011-05-25T02:09:44  <AutomatedTester> google firefox inner outer window

2011-05-25T02:13:24  <barancev> ok, I'm here for several hours
2011-05-25T02:13:48  <barancev> and what about #1610 and Chrome?

2011-05-25T02:34:55  <jarib> lisak: you should look into why your click is failing in firefox, since we're doing the right thing regarding the visibility check there
2011-05-25T02:35:26  <jarib> lisak: also if you're completely stuck on this, the hacky workaround is to change the opacity through executeScript()
2011-05-25T02:35:38  <jarib> i'll reopen the issue for chrome though
2011-05-25T02:35:52  <jarib> even though the bug is really in the chromium tree..
2011-05-25T02:38:00  <barancev> jarib: could you add a link to the bug in chromium tracker in comments?
2011-05-25T02:38:11  <jarib> i haven't filed one
2011-05-25T02:38:20  <jarib> i'm not sure how we should deal with these cases

2011-05-25T02:40:14  <lisak> I'll investigate more after lunch
2011-05-25T02:44:41  <simonstewart> jarib: chromedriver bugs? Yes
2011-05-25T02:44:58  <jarib> then that's what i'll do

2011-05-25T02:45:53  <simonstewart> AutomatedTester: the firefox rc tests fail reliably for me on Win7
2011-05-25T02:46:22  <AutomatedTester> fuuurfffu
2011-05-25T02:46:24  <jarib> i guess one way to give them an incentive to move would be to start duplicating what they have internally
2011-05-25T02:46:53  <simonstewart> give who an incentive to move?
2011-05-25T02:47:04  <simonstewart> chromedriver issues to the chromium tracker?
2011-05-25T02:48:45  <jarib> simonstewart: yes
2011-05-25T02:48:55  <jarib> move them out in the open, i mean
2011-05-25T02:48:59  <simonstewart> It'll happen
2011-05-25T02:49:34  <jarib> heh
2011-05-25T02:49:43  <jarib> so should i re-file #1610 in the chromium tracker or not?

2011-05-25T02:50:06  <simonstewart> If it's not fixed with the next release of the chromedriver downloadable
2011-05-25T02:50:14  <jarib> it's not fixed in chromium trunk
2011-05-25T02:50:23  <simonstewart> Probably a good idea then
2011-05-25T02:50:24  <jarib> i could stay wait until release, i guess

2011-05-25T02:52:16  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: this RC test, is it just hitting the hack you put in last release?
2011-05-25T02:52:26  <simonstewart> It should be
2011-05-25T02:52:29  <simonstewart> But apparently it's not
2011-05-25T02:52:46  <simonstewart> (trying to get a release of selenium out in google too)
2011-05-25T02:52:54  <simonstewart> (so a little preoccupied with that)
2011-05-25T02:53:55  <simonstewart> The hack just did a short wait and carried on
2011-05-25T02:54:11  <simonstewart> Might be smarter to stick in a loop

2011-05-25T03:10:30  <simonstewart> one of several
2011-05-25T03:11:01  <__mike> i just wondered whether there is work being done on a screenshot function for chromedriver. if not i might start working on it myself
2011-05-25T03:11:18  <simonstewart> There's an open issue on the chromium tracker for it
2011-05-25T03:11:25  <simonstewart> I'm not sure who's doing the actual work
2011-05-25T03:11:49  <simonstewart> I think that the new ChromeDriver should implement TakesScreenshot
2011-05-25T03:12:07  <simonstewart> (it should be enough to copy that method from the FirefoxDriver to the chrome driver, tbh)
2011-05-25T03:12:44  <__mike> ah i guess you mean this one http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=45209&q=screenshot%20selenium&colspec=ID%20Stars%20Pri%20Area%20Feature%20Type%20Status%20Summary%20Modified%20Owner%20Mstone%20OS
2011-05-25T03:12:47  <jarib> it's implemented in the server
2011-05-25T03:12:59  <simonstewart> Great. Should be a 30 second fix in the client

2011-05-25T03:13:32  <jarib> simonstewart: not 100% sure it's implemented in the *released* server
2011-05-25T03:13:37  <simonstewart> Heh.
2011-05-25T03:13:51  <jarib> can't remember if i tried that
2011-05-25T03:13:56  <simonstewart> Still waiting for a good build of the chromedriver to fall out of the waterfalls
2011-05-25T03:14:00  <freynaud> simonstewart: hey simon
2011-05-25T03:14:04  <simonstewart> hi
2011-05-25T03:15:07  <jarib> simonstewart: i'm 100% sure it's implemented in the released server :P
2011-05-25T03:15:15  <freynaud> atm grid listen on /grid/driver
2011-05-25T03:15:32  <simonstewart> jarib: excellent
2011-05-25T03:15:36  <simonstewart> freynaud: ok
2011-05-25T03:15:54  <freynaud> which means users have to change more than the host to move to grid. I'm not too sure why I did that, but it doesn't make sense now
2011-05-25T03:16:11  <simonstewart> Can you make everything listen to the same URL?
2011-05-25T03:16:13  <freynaud> do you see any reason to remove that and have grid listening on /wb/hub
2011-05-25T03:16:31  <simonstewart> That's fine, so long as the normal server can also listen on /wd/hub
2011-05-25T03:17:13  <freynaud> that's 2 different places, so you can have localhost:4444/wd/hub -> grid
2011-05-25T03:17:28  <freynaud> and localhost:4445/wd/hub a regular server
2011-05-25T03:19:10  <__mike> btw it's a long shot but i wonder if any of you know anything about this : http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1700 if there's a way to workaround this. it seems on the 2 systems i'm on that it's actually not possible to extend a window's vertical height past screenheight which stops this from working properly (even manually). i'm thinking it's some sort of OS setting
2011-05-25T03:20:46  <amitev> simonstewart: for my problem with the element visibility it's probably a timing issue because even my local test doesn't pass every time
2011-05-25T03:20:57  <amitev> sometimes it finds the element, sometimes it doesn't
2011-05-25T03:21:10  <simonstewart> Definitely sounds like a timing issue
2011-05-25T03:21:21  <amitev> idea how to fix it?
2011-05-25T03:21:36  <simonstewart> use implicit waits or the WebDriverWait class

2011-05-25T03:29:37  <AutomatedTester> doing that asks the user if they want it in safe mode

2011-05-25T04:20:42  <lisak> but finding element :  HtmlElement element = ((HtmlPage) lastPage()).getHtmlElementById(id);
2011-05-25T04:21:52  <lisak> htmlUnit makes just piece of html page from it ;)
2011-05-25T04:22:03  <jarib> sounds like a bug in htmlunit
2011-05-25T04:24:57  <lisak> jarib, I guess, Liferay is composed of  portlets, that are html <sections>
2011-05-25T04:25:10  <lisak> maybe is'ts just a matter of setting it up

2011-05-25T06:49:25  <freynaud> it's acting as a proxy for anything that produce json wire protocol
2011-05-25T06:49:52  <freynaud> if your device is using that to communicate you can use it
2011-05-25T06:50:00  <AutomatedTester> so I can register it as a node then? sorry I was thinking of Grid 1 where you need to tell the node to tell the hub its there
2011-05-25T06:50:32  <freynaud> the hub is wiating for a registration request explaining what the node is
2011-05-25T06:50:45  <freynaud> anything can produce that
2011-05-25T06:50:49  <freynaud> it doesn't even need to be the node
2011-05-25T06:51:04  <freynaud> you can have the mobile device plugged in for instance

2011-05-25T07:24:17  <AutomatedTester> so if you use Selenium 1, we start the browser in the less secure mode because we can control the browser better

2011-05-25T08:34:04  <rpk> Hello again.  So, I was asked to put together a demo of selenium against a small test application.  I'd very much like to use grid 2.0, which I understand I have to build against the source for.  However, the IDE isn't ready yet, correct?  So how should I approach writing these tests?
2011-05-25T08:34:23  <lisak> barancev, It's not part of the maven parent project

2011-05-25T08:36:12  <barancev> lisak: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/BuildingWebDriver , se uses its own build system 'go', not maven
2011-05-25T08:36:41  <barancev> just run 'go test_firefox' to build and run all tests for FF
2011-05-25T08:36:47  <AutomatedTester> rpk : the IDE is only for record, tweak and replay
2011-05-25T08:36:53  <lisak> I see

2011-05-25T08:37:10  <lisak> s
2011-05-25T08:37:15  <AutomatedTester> for grid you will need to have written the tests in a turing complete language
2011-05-25T08:37:16  <rpk> AutomatedTester: I've never used selenium, is it going to be feasible to put together a demo in a couple hours?
2011-05-25T08:37:22  <lisak> but I didn't know about this page
2011-05-25T08:37:22  <lisak> thanks
2011-05-25T08:37:34  <AutomatedTester> rpk: sure but ignore the IDE
2011-05-25T08:38:09  <AutomatedTester> if you want to make a good case for Selenium, use Java/Python/Ruby/.NET

2011-05-25T09:08:25  <rpk> running grid2.0 (to show that part is ready at least) against 4 nodes, to execute one simple test on different browsers simulaneously
2011-05-25T09:08:56  <rpk> and then as long as the code to do it isn't too terrible, I don't think people will have too many reservations after that

2011-05-25T09:09:36  <rpk> does that sound reasonable or no?

2011-05-25T09:16:31  <Ivog> Your runner needs to remain in cintact with grid
2011-05-25T09:17:03  <Ivog> Therefore to do parallel ur runner needs to start multiple threads
2011-05-25T09:17:04  <AutomatedTester> we at Mozilla use py.test and its parallel runner plugin for python
2011-05-25T09:17:36  <rpk> Ivog: oh I see.  Hmmm, I'm not sure how we plan on doing deployment yet... I think we should be ok with one server so long as the tests create unique workspaces to work with
2011-05-25T09:17:52  <rpk> I don't think each node would get a deployment, it would take too long
2011-05-25T09:18:30  <Ivog> You should carefully think about that is my suggestion

2011-05-25T10:53:26  <mario-goulart> Hi.  I'm trying to make Scheme bindings to access the firefox web driver.  I'm a bit confused. The introduction from http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriverInternals says "Language bindings control the driver by connecting over a socket and sending commands (described in the JsonWireProtocol page) in UTF-8".  So, as far as I understand, to create a session I'd need to post a json object like {"browserName": "firefox",
2011-05-25T10:53:27  <mario-goulart> "version": "3.6", "javascriptEnabled": true, "platform": "LINUX"}} to http://127.0.0.1:7055/hub/session.  Is that correct?
2011-05-25T10:58:15  <mario-goulart> Then the "Sending Commands to Firefox" section (from http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriverInternals) says that I should send a json object containing context, commandName, parameters and elementId.  What should I do after all?  I'm afraid I'm missing something important.
2011-05-25T10:59:10  <freynaud> are you trying to test or write your own client ?

2011-05-25T10:59:37  <freynaud> if you just want to test, the client generating the correct json request are already there to help you

2011-05-25T11:01:13  <jarib> mario-goulart: the FirefoxDriverInternals page is a bit outdated. the firefox driver is a full RemoteWebDriver implementation at this point
2011-05-25T11:01:56  <jarib> so you only need to implement a client for the remote protocol
2011-05-25T11:02:10  <jarib> of which there are several examples already
2011-05-25T11:03:03  <mario-goulart> jarib: Ok. Is the remote protocol the Jason wire protocol?
2011-05-25T11:03:14  <jarib> yes :)
2011-05-25T11:03:34  <mario-goulart> Alright.  Sorry for the lame questions.  I'm a bit lost at the terminology. :-)
2011-05-25T11:03:37  <jarib> mario-goulart: if i were you, start with calling the remote java server
2011-05-25T11:04:10  <jarib> so you don't have to worry about launching firefox with the extension installed etc. just yet
2011-05-25T11:04:43  <mario-goulart> jarib: I _think_ I could get firefox running with the webdriver extension.
2011-05-25T11:05:00  <mario-goulart> But I'm getting "Client error: 405 Method Not Allowed"
2011-05-25T11:05:08  <jarib> ok, it's just easier starting with the remote server
2011-05-25T11:05:40  <jarib> all the work you do on implementing the wire protocol with the remote server can be used for chrome/firefox/ie directly later

2011-05-25T11:08:17  <mario-goulart> Maybe I should try the same request to the java server.

2011-05-25T12:06:43  <miker2> jarib: that works great.  Can't believe I didn't think of that.
2011-05-25T12:07:07  <jarib> cool
2011-05-25T12:07:54  <rpk> Sweet, it all works.  Thanks!

2011-05-25T12:19:05  <jarib> huh, never heard of that issue before
2011-05-25T12:19:09  <rpk> I have a RemoteWebDriver(url, DesiredCapabilities.chrome()).  When I try and run the test, it throws an exception that the path to the chromedriver executable must be set by the webdriver.chrome.driver system property.  I don't see why the path needs to be set for a remote test?
2011-05-25T12:19:58  <jarib> mario-goulart: that answer seems quite java-specific as well
2011-05-25T12:20:04  <rpk> IE and firefox work great though.
2011-05-25T12:20:13  <jarib> rpk: the server needs to know where to find the chromedriver (which is a separate download)
2011-05-25T12:20:43  <jarib> rpk: adding it to PATH should work as well
2011-05-25T12:21:31  <mario-goulart> jarib: the server which doesn't seem to be responding is the java one.  Anyway, I don't think the entropy is the problem.
2011-05-25T12:21:37  <rpk> so the chromedriver needs to be on my machine executing the test in the browser, or the machine running the test?
2011-05-25T12:21:51  <jarib> rpk: the one executing the test in the browser
2011-05-25T12:23:09  <jarib> basically it's your client -> [wire protocol] -> remote server -> [wire protocol] -> chromedriver server -> [chrome IPC] -> chrome
2011-05-25T12:23:39  <jarib> mario-goulart: what you're seeing is not a common problem

2011-05-25T12:26:10  <mario-goulart> jarib: It's quite possible I'm doing something very stupid.  I just can't see what. :-)  Basically, what I'm doing is
2011-05-25T12:26:11  <mario-goulart> Starting the java server:
2011-05-25T12:26:11  <mario-goulart> $ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar
2011-05-25T12:26:11  <mario-goulart> Running the python client:
2011-05-25T12:26:14  <mario-goulart> > from selenium import webdriver
2011-05-25T12:26:17  <mario-goulart> > browser = webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities={"browserName": "firefox", "version": "3.6", "javascriptEnabled": true, "platform": "LINUX"})
2011-05-25T12:26:41  <mario-goulart> Then I get no response.
2011-05-25T12:26:57  <jarib> hmm. do you have ruby installed?
2011-05-25T12:27:06  <jarib> i'm not too familiar with the python bindings
2011-05-25T12:27:34  <mario-goulart> Ok.  I do.  I'm not familiar with ruby, but I can try the ruby bindings.
2011-05-25T12:27:51  <mario-goulart> I have 1.8.7 here.
2011-05-25T12:28:18  <mario-goulart> I'm checking http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RubyBindings
2011-05-25T12:28:27  <jarib> mario-goulart: try just (sudo) gem install selenium-webdriver
2011-05-25T12:28:50  <rpk> jarib, is there any chance that chromedriver is already prebuilt somewhere in my selenium repo?
2011-05-25T12:29:21  <jarib> and then run this: ruby -d -rubygems -rselenium-webdriver -e 'Selenium::WebDriver.for(:remote).quit' and paste the output to http://gist.github.com/
2011-05-25T12:29:32  <jarib> rpk: the chromedriver source lives in the chromium tree, not in ours
2011-05-25T12:29:36  <jarib> you can get the prebuilts from :downloads

2011-05-25T12:39:04  <jarib> perhaps a gem1.8 or some such?
2011-05-25T12:39:09  <jarib> (if you're on ubuntu)
2011-05-25T12:39:29  <jarib> ah, wait
2011-05-25T12:39:32  <jarib> try this instead:
2011-05-25T12:39:45  <mario-goulart> Yes (Debian).  I'm actually using 1.8:
2011-05-25T12:39:46  <mario-goulart> $ readlink -f `which gem`
2011-05-25T12:39:46  <mario-goulart> /usr/bin/gem1.8
2011-05-25T12:39:54  <jarib> ruby -d -rubygems -e 'require "selenium-webdriver"; Selenium::WebDriver.for(:remote).quit'
2011-05-25T12:40:16  <mario-goulart> Ah! :-)
2011-05-25T12:40:50  <jarib> if that also hangs, try s/:remote/:firefox/
2011-05-25T12:40:56  <mario-goulart> Similar behavior.  No response yet.
2011-05-25T12:41:07  <jarib> see if :firefox works
2011-05-25T12:41:34  <mario-goulart> Ok.  firefox seems to work.
2011-05-25T12:41:43  <mario-goulart> :remote times out.
2011-05-25T12:42:04  <jarib> interesting.

2011-05-25T12:42:27  <jarib> it should
2011-05-25T12:42:48  <jarib> though may be worth trying 1.6
2011-05-25T12:46:03  <mario-goulart> Jesus christ. Java screwed me.
2011-05-25T12:46:08  <mario-goulart> Works with 1.6.

2011-05-25T13:08:45  <bkkb> yeah that'd be great!

2011-05-25T13:12:56  <jarib> capybara uses Selenium 2/WebDriver
2011-05-25T13:13:28  <eranm> barancev, yes. The only remaining bit is getting the native events libraries compiled with gecko 2 and checking in the new SDK
2011-05-25T13:13:46  <sfbrian> i'm using the alt methods: https://saucelabs.com/docs/sauce-ondemand#alternative-annotation-methods
2011-05-25T13:14:05  <sfbrian> yeah, my answer was with RC
2011-05-25T13:14:32  <bkkb> that would make sense

2011-05-25T13:45:20  <jimevans> eranm|mac: did i see that ff4 native events are working on windows? (sorry i've been out of the office most of the day)
2011-05-25T13:45:29  <jarib> phirefly: or if you're on 1.8;  ruby -rubygems -e 'require "selenium-webdriver"; Selenium::WebDriver.for(:firefox).close'

2011-05-25T13:47:02  <rpk> AutomatedTester: no, its the same in both firefox and chrome
2011-05-25T13:47:09  <AutomatedTester> the ID never changes?
2011-05-25T13:47:44  <rpk> nope, not as far as I can tell

2011-05-25T13:48:25  <AutomatedTester> rpk: sorry I dont have time to debug for you
2011-05-25T13:48:37  <phirefly> yep. on 1.8. it's hanging
2011-05-25T13:49:08  <jarib> phirefly: oh, sorry. i forgot -d on the 1.8 line
2011-05-25T13:49:28  <jarib> phirefly: ctrl-c that, add `ruby -d ...` and try it again
2011-05-25T13:49:31  <jarib> that's the output we need
2011-05-25T13:49:33  <rpk> So I have an id that never changes, and is in a div under the body node of the page.  I have 2 iframes under body as well.  Is there anything else it could be?
2011-05-25T13:49:36  *** koops has joined #selenium
2011-05-25T13:49:54  <rpk> I don't understand how it can't find an id in the final source of the page.
2011-05-25T13:50:36  <jarib> rpk: timing issue maybe?
2011-05-25T13:50:56  <rpk> jarib: shouldn't it automatically wait for the page to indicate its done loading?
2011-05-25T13:51:07  <jarib> up to a point, yes
2011-05-25T13:51:16  <rpk> Or is it not aware of javascript executing in iframes?
2011-05-25T13:51:18  <jarib> but the definition of "loaded" varies widly
2011-05-25T13:51:34  <rpk> jarib: can I put a simple sleep in there to quickly check?
2011-05-25T13:51:58  <jarib> that's ok to figure out if it's a timing problem
2011-05-25T13:52:22  <phirefly> jarib, getting output: <Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::SocketLock:0x1019ca9f8>: getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
2011-05-25T13:52:35  <jarib> phirefly: please gist the full output
2011-05-25T13:53:37  <rpk> jarib: yep, that did it.  I added a Thread.sleep and it worked fine.
2011-05-25T13:53:52  <rpk> So whats my long term solution here?
2011-05-25T13:54:39  <rpk> Since every page is built with javascript in gwt, there is no way that Selenium could be compatible with gwt by default.
2011-05-25T13:54:41  <jarib> rpk: either waiting explicitly (see the WebDriverWait class) or configuring implicit waits (driver.manage().timeouts()...)
2011-05-25T13:55:02  <jarib> "compatible by default"?
2011-05-25T13:55:19  <rpk> Out of the box?  With the default wait implementation I guess?
2011-05-25T13:57:00  <phirefly> https://gist.github.com/991979
2011-05-25T13:57:01  <jarib> it's tricky to get right, and in the end, only the author knows what is considered "loaded"
2011-05-25T13:57:49  <jarib> rpk: consider onload="setTimeout(buildEntirePage)"
2011-05-25T13:57:55  <rpk> jarib: yeah, I suppose.  Is there a way for me to change this for every test all at once, or will every test need to use WebDriverWait (which does look pretty cool)
2011-05-25T13:58:15  <jarib> rpk: you can configure implicit waits through the timeouts interface
2011-05-25T13:58:49  <jarib> then every findElement() call will poll until it's found or the timeout is reached
2011-05-25T13:59:32  <jarib> personally i like waiting explicitly though, so i know what's going on

2011-05-25T14:25:38  <rpk> If I wanted to select all the elements on the page with an id beginning with a certain string , should I be using xpath or does selenium have a selector implementation as well?

2011-05-25T14:29:27  <eranm|mac> It wasn't that big with gecko SDK 1.9
2011-05-25T14:29:36  <jimevans> eranm|mac: you're building through Visual Studio? you have the x64 cross compiler tools installed?
2011-05-25T14:29:38  <rpk> AutomatedTester: well I meant like using [id^="gwt-table-val"]

2011-05-25T14:29:56  <rpk> I don't know, I just find it more intuitive than xpath;
2011-05-25T14:30:07  <AutomatedTester> eranm|mac: for that prompts stuff we need to poll to check that we have overridden the alert
2011-05-25T14:30:16  <jimevans> eranm|mac: you still need the cross-compilers.

2011-05-25T23:59:46  <artknish> If multiple elements match an xpath expression, is there a way to get all of them using Selenium client? It currently fetches the first one it finds.
