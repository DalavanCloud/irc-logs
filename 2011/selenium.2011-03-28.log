2011-03-28T06:29:14  * adamgoucher did pki testing for 6 years
2011-03-28T06:29:20  <nirvdrum> Heh.
2011-03-28T06:29:32  <nirvdrum> I'd be on board with it if I hadn't been screwed in the past by people screwing up SSL configs.
2011-03-28T06:29:36  <nirvdrum> By people, I mean me.
2011-03-28T06:30:17  <adamgoucher> scripts for functionality are separate than people not knowing how to setup their ssl configs. two different problems
2011-03-28T06:30:35  <nirvdrum> I consider that functionality of my site.
2011-03-28T06:30:53  <adamgoucher> (and i feel the pain; ive screwed iis' settings so badly before that ive have to pave the machine. damn registry...)
2011-03-28T06:30:58  <nirvdrum> If certain pages must be secured via SSL that's an invariant of that page.
2011-03-28T06:31:17  <nirvdrum> In my case, it's almost always screwing up a mod_rewrite rule.
2011-03-28T06:31:29  <nirvdrum> So, i find it helpful to have a staging environment to test against.
2011-03-28T06:31:44  <adamgoucher> which should be version controlled and tested, just like everything else
2011-03-28T06:32:16  <nirvdrum> Right . . .
2011-03-28T06:32:34  <adamgoucher> oh, and my ssl rant also includes the caveot of 'if you feel that you must do ssl, then set things up correctly' -- self signed certs != correctly
2011-03-28T06:32:44  <nirvdrum> Fair enough.
2011-03-28T06:32:49  <nirvdrum> I do properly sign my certs :-)
2011-03-28T06:33:13  <adamgoucher> pay money to a ca, or setup an internal one. paying money is certainly the easiest
2011-03-28T06:33:34  <nirvdrum> Sure.  At $10 for a cert these days, that's the simplest option.
2011-03-28T06:34:39  <adamgoucher> for bigish companies, setting up a private ca is sometimes the easiest option. though you then have to install the root ca on machines. which is also something that can be automated

2011-03-28T06:45:54  *** csanchez has joined #selenium
2011-03-28T06:46:32  <jimevans> i've reached the limit of what i can test. it might be a bug in the closure compiler we use to compile the javascript atoms.
2011-03-28T06:46:41  <ahfeel> ok :)
2011-03-28T06:47:04  *** QAguy has joined #selenium
2011-03-28T06:47:06  <ahfeel> and is there a way to test the same code but not closure compiled ?
2011-03-28T06:47:53  <jimevans> not for ie. the javascript code gets compiled into a c++ header file, which is in turn compiled into the native code IE driver .dll.

2011-03-28T06:56:13  <gtailleb> yep
2011-03-28T06:58:10  <gtailleb> hum, how do we tell jquery to do noConflict()?
2011-03-28T06:59:11  <ahfeel> $.noConflict()
2011-03-28T06:59:21  <ahfeel> issue is that afterwards
2011-03-28T06:59:32  <ahfeel> we need to always use jQuery() instead of $()
2011-03-28T06:59:48  <ahfeel> but for the login page you may be able to test this out easily
2011-03-28T07:06:04  <jimevans> did we come to a consensus on closing "NeedsClarification" bugs after a certain age?
2011-03-28T07:08:23  <gtailleb> AutomatedTester,ahfeel:  executing ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("$.noConflict();"); before the findElement(By.name) doesn't change anything => still have the javascript error relative to the unknown "Inherits" locator strategy

2011-03-28T07:43:20  <notdiminoten> or is there an easier way to implement custom locator strategies in 2.0?

2011-03-28T07:46:16  *** lfryc has joined #selenium
2011-03-28T07:46:45  <melter> adamgoucher: thanks
2011-03-28T07:47:34  <jimevans> notdiminoten: the webdriver (2.0) api doesn't have a way to develop custom locators at present.
2011-03-28T07:47:54  <jimevans> many of the drivers are based on the RemoteWebDriver, which adheres to the JSON wire protocol
2011-03-28T07:48:09  <jimevans> the protocol doesn't have provisions for passing a custom locator.
2011-03-28T07:48:48  <notdiminoten> hum :-/
2011-03-28T07:49:20  <jimevans> there's no real browser- and language-independent way to enable creation and registration of a custom locator.
2011-03-28T07:50:39  <jimevans> by that, i mean that the 2.0 webdriver technology drives the browser in a completely different way than the 1.x api.
2011-03-28T07:51:15  <jimevans> this implies that a custom locator would need to be implemented as part of the firefox extension for firefox, the ie driver c++ com dll for ie, and so on.
2011-03-28T07:51:26  <adamgoucher> and in a much more opinionated way (to recycle rails' usage of the word)
2011-03-28T07:52:34  <notdiminoten> in the meantime I can extend the By class though, yeah?  that'd be a decent stop-gap
2011-03-28T07:53:43  <new2b> can I create an array inside selenium IDE?
2011-03-28T07:53:55  <new2b> aside from storedVars['name']
2011-03-28T07:55:48  <jimevans> notdiminoten: you're welcome to try it, but i'm doubtful it will work, unless you're calling one of the built-in locators under the covers and filtering the results in a custom way.
2011-03-28T07:56:08  <new2b> or should I jsut stick with creating basically 16-20 new variables in storedVars and just use that?
2011-03-28T07:56:59  <jimevans> notdiminoten: i'd be curious to discover where you find the current built-in locators lacking, but i'm off to a meeting.

2011-03-28T09:20:52  <jarib> andytinkham: in ruby not really without setting TMPDIR or similar (we use Dir.mktmpdir)
2011-03-28T09:21:19  <unixSnob> looks like I got past that problem.. nevermind folks
2011-03-28T09:22:08  <andytinkham> jarib: I figures that might be the case, and I think if I did that, it would affect McAfee. (For the record, I'm still dealing with that Firefox EOF problem again. I'm wondering if it maybe virus scan related, since it came back after my reinstall and I can no longer blame the VP).
2011-03-28T09:24:45  <andytinkham> jarib: I'm blaming McAfee now, as I'm seeing logs from it saying "This would be blocked, if we were enforcing the rules, but we're not!" (essentially :) ).

2011-03-28T09:41:48  <unixSnob> is the firefox plugin needed to drive firefox?
2011-03-28T09:41:57  <unixSnob> or is the plugin just for recording actions?

2011-03-28T09:54:45  <andytinkham> jarib: Unfortunately, now I've completely uninstalled it, rebooted and I still have the problem. I'm systematically killing off processes now to see if I can create an FF driver once I do
2011-03-28T09:54:46  <unixSnob> jarib: I just checked the docs, and saw that it's still supported.  Are the docs out of date?
2011-03-28T09:55:05  <jarib> if you can whitelist some ports, try 7055 (and possibly some above if you want to run multiple instances)
2011-03-28T09:55:08  <jarib> oh, ok
2011-03-28T09:55:09  <unixSnob> that's where I see it => http://seleniumhq.org/docs/01_introducing_selenium.html#supported-browsers

2011-03-28T10:11:52  <andytinkham> Ah! It is in the port list. Netstat showed a local connection from 127.0.0.1:49442 to 127.0.0.1:7055 before I disabled Forticlient and not afterwards
2011-03-28T10:12:18  <jarib> ah, so forticlient actually has something listening on 7055?
2011-03-28T10:12:24  <jarib> what's the bug # again?

2011-03-28T10:13:35  <jarib> hmm, ok
2011-03-28T10:14:02  <jarib> so forticlient has something running on 7055, firefox silently fails to bind to it, and then the connection from ruby just fails
2011-03-28T10:14:31  <jarib> i'm wondering if firefox is able to bind, but on another interface
2011-03-28T10:14:39  <jarib> and then we just connect to the wrong one
2011-03-28T10:14:49  <andytinkham> I can turn Forticlient back on if you want me to check anything :)

2011-03-28T10:27:57  <unixSnob> jarib: what browsers work for selenium 2, other than firefox?
2011-03-28T10:28:11  <unixSnob> i need an FF alternative for debian
2011-03-28T10:28:36  <jarib> i'd definitely use Firefox on debian
2011-03-28T10:28:43  <jarib> but IE and Chrome is supported as well
2011-03-28T10:28:59  <jarib> (Chrome driver is currently going through a rewrite though)
2011-03-28T10:29:03  <unixSnob> IE on linux?  probably not.
2011-03-28T10:29:11  <unixSnob> I might be limited to chrome
2011-03-28T10:29:28  <jarib> why can't you use firefox?
2011-03-28T10:29:32  <unixSnob> debian etch cannot handle current FF versions
2011-03-28T10:29:51  <unixSnob> jarib: there's political issues that cause debian to rebrand firefox as something else
2011-03-28T10:30:21  <jarib> that doesn't stop you from downloading an official package from mozilla though
2011-03-28T10:30:22  <unixSnob> so it's difficult to get firefox on debian
2011-03-28T10:30:27  <unixSnob> I did that
2011-03-28T10:30:34  <unixSnob> FF4 pukes
2011-03-28T10:30:39  <unixSnob> doesn't like my libraries

2011-03-28T10:31:18  <unixSnob> ./firefox-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2011-03-28T10:32:20  <unixSnob> jarib: what's the oldest version of FF supported by Selenium2?
2011-03-28T10:32:30  <unixSnob> The oldest version may be my best chance
2011-03-28T10:32:44  <jarib> ok. i filed a similar bug here, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=643695
2011-03-28T10:32:49  <jarib> i'd try 3.6
2011-03-28T10:32:52  <unixSnob> k
2011-03-28T10:32:55  <jarib> 3.0 should be the oldest supported version
2011-03-28T10:35:27  *** andytinkham has joined #selenium
2011-03-28T10:38:58  <unixSnob> 3.6 has the same issue on etch.  i'd like to try 3.0, but it doesn't look like mozilla wants it to be easy to get
2011-03-28T10:39:51  <unixSnob> found 3.0.. just had to manipulate the version number in an URL
2011-03-28T10:47:17  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-03-28T10:47:51  <unixSnob> appears to be an architecture problem.. the missing file (libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0) is on 32bit archs
2011-03-28T10:48:04  <unixSnob> i'm on a 64bit arch
2011-03-28T10:48:44  <unixSnob> nevermind.. the file is on 64bit archs too
2011-03-28T10:49:17  <unixSnob> I think I just need to hack my LD_LIBRARY_PATH or something
2011-03-28T10:50:51  <jarib> mozilla didn't ship 64-bit builds until Firefox 4 AFAIK
2011-03-28T10:51:04  <jarib> so if you have a 64-bit libgtk-x11-2.0 that won't work
2011-03-28T10:51:09  <jarib> (with 3.X)
2011-03-28T10:51:18  <unixSnob> well I could try ff4 again
2011-03-28T10:51:31  <unixSnob> but i'm not sure how to make FF look in /usr/lib for the file
2011-03-28T10:52:36  <jarib> dlopen usually looks there
2011-03-28T10:53:23  <unixSnob> i'm not familiar with dlopen.. I don't seem to have that
2011-03-28T10:53:43  <unixSnob> I set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /usr/lib, but FF4 still does not see the file
2011-03-28T10:53:54  <jarib> FF4 searches /usr/lib by default, is my point
2011-03-28T10:54:01  <jarib> (since it uses dlopen)
2011-03-28T10:54:03  <unixSnob> firefox-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2011-03-28T10:54:46  <jarib> i got to run
2011-03-28T10:54:51  <jarib> perhaps you have a /usr/lib64?

2011-03-28T19:55:03  <selbot2> dawagner less than a minute ago - Pulling out element selecting and toggling tests into a new class, fleshing them out a lot (probably not quite fleshed out enough, but a good baseline), making them pass in the HtmlUnitDriver.  Need to sort out the other drivers/atoms.  Found a few WebDriverBackedSelenium bugs along the way... - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=11826
