2011-04-09T06:49:42  <krosenvold> jarib: i'm not sure i understand
2011-04-09T06:50:00  <krosenvold> we run 24/7 stable se2 builds
2011-04-09T06:50:24  <krosenvold> with twice weekly boots of the browser bots
2011-04-09T06:50:44  <krosenvold> Other than that its rock solid
2011-04-09T06:51:27  <krosenvold> But we stay clear of virtualization
2011-04-09T06:51:56  <krosenvold> But those boxes run 4 browsers each non-stop
2011-04-09T06:53:11  <krosenvold> I think the problem might be that 'go' should run hourly om Xserve
2011-04-09T06:53:34  <krosenvold> gives a much clearer picture of overall test stability
2011-04-09T06:54:07  <jarib> krosenvold: just from my experience with our bamboo instance, and the types of failures that clog things up; clean VMs would help
2011-04-09T06:54:15  <krosenvold> I'll setup that on my own bamboo to evaluate
2011-04-09T06:54:16  <jarib> reducing it to just run go would probably help as well
2011-04-09T06:54:47  <krosenvold> but why/what clogs it?
2011-04-09T06:54:57  <krosenvold> hanging browsers?
2011-04-09T06:55:29  <jarib> yeah
2011-04-09T06:55:39  <krosenvold> Firefox?
2011-04-09T06:55:57  <jarib> or IE - e.g. a crash in the native code will bring up the windows crash dialog
2011-04-09T06:56:47  <krosenvold> never been able to get any stability with IE
2011-04-09T06:57:08  <jarib> it's getting there with jim's contributions.
2011-04-09T06:57:22  <jarib> krosenvold: btw, tried the new chrome driver?
2011-04-09T06:57:28  <krosenvold> Could we use some kind of process wrapper around go?
2011-04-09T06:58:24  <krosenvold> the dev channel 64 bit deb is still too old
2011-04-09T06:58:43  <krosenvold> the process wrapper could killall Firefox
2011-04-09T06:58:46  <krosenvold> and ir
2011-04-09T06:58:54  <krosenvold> s/ir/IE
2011-04-09T06:58:54  <jarib> right
2011-04-09T06:58:58  <jarib> that'd definitely help
2011-04-09T06:59:02  <krosenvold> On timeout?
2011-04-09T06:59:23  <jarib> probably
2011-04-09T06:59:31  <jarib> there's already a go wrapper somewhere in the tree
2011-04-09T06:59:36  <jarib> (in java)
2011-04-09T07:00:02  <jarib> there are others issues as well though - the VMs should be configured to not run auto-updates etc.
2011-04-09T07:00:13  <krosenvold> But i dont Think theres anything Java that works in Windows
2011-04-09T07:00:38  <krosenvold> for process trees
2011-04-09T07:00:49  <jarib> right
2011-04-09T07:01:04  <jarib> this is where a clean VM would come in handy :)

2011-04-09T12:26:11  <santiycr> krosenvold: so I have these problems with bamboo
2011-04-09T12:26:25  <santiycr> I'm hoping you'll be able to solve them
2011-04-09T12:27:06  <santiycr> 1) When builds hung, bamboo is able to detect it, but after spending over 15 minutes, I can't find a configuration that will allow me to set bamboo to kill them
2011-04-09T12:29:01  <santiycr> 2) I'm willing to set Bamboo to send emails, so that we know when things break. It doesn't have it's own SMTP server and we have to set one ourselves, which is annoying considering that CI servers rely so much in email notifications  that they should have figured this out already

2011-04-09T12:30:07  <santiycr> this is the message:

2011-04-09T12:32:53  <santiycr> having those 4 points, I declare bamboo is the worst CI tool I've used so far. Right bellow Buildbot, which I take as acceptable under the premise that buildbot's goal is to give users a basic tool that they will extend themselves

2011-04-09T22:27:01  <AutomatedTester> nirvdrum: nice one!
2011-04-09T22:27:11  <nirvdrum> Thanks.
2011-04-09T22:27:17  <nirvdrum> Got some more testing to do.
2011-04-09T22:27:19  <nirvdrum> But looking good.
2011-04-09T22:27:25  <AutomatedTester> cool
2011-04-09T22:28:05  <AutomatedTester> we are looking forward to being guinea pigs at Moz
2011-04-09T22:28:48  <nirvdrum> It should be usable now.
2011-04-09T22:28:57  <nirvdrum> I've been waiting for the other Dave to hop online.
2011-04-09T22:29:17  <nirvdrum> Francois got a big usability patch in.
2011-04-09T22:29:27  <nirvdrum> And I've been keen on getting backwards-compat in.
2011-04-09T22:29:56  <AutomatedTester> other Dave is somewhere over the Atlantic atm
2011-04-09T22:30:57  <nirvdrum> Ahh.
2011-04-09T22:31:02  <nirvdrum> I fly back no Monday.
2011-04-09T22:31:08  <nirvdrum> s/no/on/
2011-04-09T22:31:19  <nirvdrum> Are you still in MV?  Or did you fly back already?
2011-04-09T22:31:24  <AutomatedTester> still in SF?
2011-04-09T22:31:28  <AutomatedTester> MV
2011-04-09T22:31:34  <AutomatedTester> here till Wednesday
2011-04-09T22:32:41  <nirvdrum> Yeah.  I've now moved down to embarcardero for GitHub's CodeConf.
2011-04-09T22:33:43  <AutomatedTester> ahh cool
2011-04-09T22:33:57  <AutomatedTester> is that a good conf?
2011-04-09T22:34:07  <nirvdrum> So far, so good.
2011-04-09T22:34:18  <nirvdrum> Drinking is much more aggressive, too.
2011-04-09T22:34:26  <nirvdrum> I bailed on the open bar.
2011-04-09T22:34:27  <AutomatedTester> hehe
2011-04-09T22:34:40  <nirvdrum> After 5 whiskies I was ready to head back.  I got my fill at SeleniumConf.
2011-04-09T22:35:34  <nirvdrum> My biggest complaint is the conference room has no power at all.
2011-04-09T22:35:50  <nirvdrum> On the one hand, it's good to pay attention.
2011-04-09T22:36:05  <nirvdrum> On the other, "./go release" takes so damn long that I'm not missing out on most of the talks anyway.
