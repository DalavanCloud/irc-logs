[2014-04-28 13:23:34] AutomatedTester: jleyba: got a question about page load strategies
[2014-04-28 13:24:24] jleyba: Ok
[2014-04-28 13:24:24] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I raised https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=25490 today because from top level context conservative and normal are the same
[2014-04-28 13:24:50] AutomatedTester: but reading the prose it is suggesting that if we have done a switchToFrame normal should only care about the frame you are in
[2014-04-28 13:24:57] lukeis: dude-x: go on… ;)  (btw, i would use execute_async_script, if you are decent at Javascript)
[2014-04-28 13:25:11] AutomatedTester: and ancestor frames are ignored
[2014-04-28 13:25:17] jleyba: AutomatedTester: Yes, I believe that is the case
[2014-04-28 13:25:50] AutomatedTester: jleyba: ok, but a navigate only happens at the top level context
[2014-04-28 13:25:50] dude-x: lukeis: you're right, the timeout function would best use async_script
[2014-04-28 13:26:48] jleyba: AutomatedTester: a navigate triggered by webdriver
[2014-04-28 13:26:54] AutomatedTester: jleyba: yea
[2014-04-28 13:27:12] AutomatedTester: and clicks dont have a described behaviour
[2014-04-28 13:28:28] jleyba: do they need it?
[2014-04-28 13:28:28] AutomatedTester: no
[2014-04-28 13:28:28] jleyba: unless the top level frame navigates to a new page, then webdriver should revert control to that frame and wait on it
[2014-04-28 13:28:28] jleyba: if you're in a frame, and that frame navigates for any reason, webdriver should wait for it
[2014-04-28 13:28:34] AutomatedTester: ok...
[2014-04-28 13:30:28] AutomatedTester: that needs to be described
[2014-04-28 13:30:28] AutomatedTester: at the moment it doesnt
[2014-04-28 13:30:28] jleyba: yeah that needs to be stated
[2014-04-28 13:30:28] AutomatedTester: thats suggesting listening for onUnload events and then performing the wait
[2014-04-28 13:30:28] jleyba: otherwise users would have to call switchTo().defaultContent() after every navigation
