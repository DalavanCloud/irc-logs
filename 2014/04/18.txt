[2014-04-18 05:56:53] vjacob: how much support is there really for running Selenium WebDriver on Linux, using either Firefox or Chrome (with Eclipse)? And which specific version combinations have been known to work (if it should function based on your experience)?
[2014-04-18 05:56:59] vjacob: Not much luck with Firefox at all.

[2014-04-18 08:45:09] lagweezle: Yesterday I was (mostly?) talking with lukeis regarding issue https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1934 and thinking it might not actually be fixed.
[2014-04-18 08:46:49] lagweezle: We've got a Selenium task that fires off about ... I think 120 times an hour. From 6p yesterday disk was being consumed, with 6 GB taken up by /tmp/anonymous<number>webdriver-profile (<number> being some random number; firefox profile).
[2014-04-18 08:48:06] lagweezle: Er, 6p to 3a 6 GB was eaten up by those being left. It stopped at 3a after exhausting disk space. I shut down the selenium process for that node and all the space was released (all the directories were cleared automagically).

[2014-04-18 08:48:55] lagweezle: I had thought that our forced stop at 3min for a job was causing driver.quit() not to be called, but that should no longer be the case after the changes I made.
[2014-04-18 08:49:19] lagweezle: So now I'm back to being confused as to what I can fix, or how to make this a reproducible scenario for dev to get a closer look at. :/

[2014-04-18 09:34:22] jlipps: wanted to touch base re: mjsonwp contributions to selenium
[2014-04-18 09:35:09] lukeis: RossPatterson: i believe most of europe is on a 4-day weekend now ;)
[2014-04-18 09:35:30] jlipps: my team's been hard at work implementing the stuff from the spec as well as appium's own not-in-the-spec extensions
[2014-04-18 09:35:44] RossPatterson: Got an "you dead?" tweet from AT, reminded me it's been almost a year since I was last here.
[2014-04-18 09:35:56] jlipps: you'll be happy to know that we stopped using driver.execute_script("mobile: xxx") in favor of actual extensions to the wire protocol via the /appium namespace :-)

[2014-04-18 09:36:10] lukeis: awesome :)
[2014-04-18 09:36:32] lukeis: selendroid uses  /wd/hub/-selendroid/:sessionId
[2014-04-18 09:37:06] jlipps: lukeis:  nice! curious: how are you telling people to access these methods?
[2014-04-18 09:37:23] lukeis: we expose a "SelendroidDriver" class that implements it
[2014-04-18 09:37:42] lukeis: but that's java only right now
[2014-04-18 09:37:50] jlipps: oh gotcha, so people include selendroid as a dep for their tests?
[2014-04-18 09:37:55] lukeis: yes
[2014-04-18 09:38:11] lukeis: (i don't… but that's just me)
[2014-04-18 09:38:28] lukeis: I have my own "SelendroidDriver" class :)
[2014-04-18 09:38:30] jlipps: lukeis:  ok. wondering if we overlap in functionality between any of the selendroid-specific things and the appium-specific things
[2014-04-18 09:38:40] lukeis: cause I have it switch between appium and selendroid ;)
[2014-04-18 09:38:46] jlipps: maybe we'd want to collaborate on a -mobile namespace so there's more portability
[2014-04-18 09:39:12] lukeis: if there's really a common ground it should just be in the mobile spec
[2014-04-18 09:39:26] jlipps: true
[2014-04-18 09:39:42] lukeis: do you have an endpoint to run arbitrary adb commands?
[2014-04-18 09:40:14] jlipps: lukeis:  these are our extensions: https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/1.0-beta/lib/server/routing.js#L94-L119
[2014-04-18 09:40:18] jlipps: lukeis:  no
[2014-04-18 09:40:29] jlipps: i haven't wanted to open up that particular floodgate
[2014-04-18 09:41:19] lukeis: i don't use it ;) but we have it...
[2014-04-18 09:41:46] jlipps: yeah
[2014-04-18 09:42:15] lukeis: why do you have this? https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/1.0-beta/lib/server/routing.js#L98
[2014-04-18 09:42:30] jlipps: lukeis:  arbitrary degree rotation
[2014-04-18 09:42:37] jlipps: not orientation setting
[2014-04-18 09:42:41] lukeis: ah, ok
[2014-04-18 09:43:07] lukeis: https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/1.0-beta/lib/server/routing.js#L106  should be  sessionId/airplane-mode  ;)
[2014-04-18 09:43:11] lukeis: mobile spec!
[2014-04-18 09:43:11] jlipps: most of these extensions expose something useful that one of the platforms provides
[2014-04-18 09:43:19] jlipps: lukeis:  if it actually follwed the spec it would be!
[2014-04-18 09:43:26] selbot2: 04 Open issues: 792
[2014-04-18 09:43:35] lukeis: i'm currently implementing that in selendroid
[2014-04-18 09:43:37] jlipps: but it doesn't. all we can do is toggle it. not reliably get which state it is in, or set it to an arbitrary state from an arbitrary state
[2014-04-18 09:44:06] jlipps: lukeis:  i'd be happy to learn about your hax!
[2014-04-18 09:44:34] lukeis: basically selendroid (in app) can read global settings… so I can see what airplane mode is...
[2014-04-18 09:45:06] lukeis: but to toggle it, I'm starting the AIRPLANE_MODE activity and using DPAD key events to toggle it
[2014-04-18 09:45:07] jlipps: that's useful. wonder if uiautomator can do anything similar. doesn't seem like it. can you get global settings with adb?
[2014-04-18 09:45:17] jlipps: lukeis:  ah yes that's what we do for toggling as well
[2014-04-18 09:46:03] lukeis: turns out I couldn't write to the global settings (i found out how, but security settings in the OS don't allow me in any way)
[2014-04-18 09:47:40] jlipps: interesting
[2014-04-18 09:49:20] jlipps: anyway lukeis the main reason i pinged you was to say that so far all our code is living in the appium clients. because of our really aggressive launch schedule it made sense in the short term so we have something to offer appium users independent of what makes sense for selenium's release schedule. but we'll be cutting the code out and cleaning it up to present as PRs to the main selenium repo as soon as we can.

[2014-04-18 09:50:42] lukeis: ok, although the Selenium repo should only contain the bits that are common (i.e. just in the mobile spec) and not vendor specific extensions… at least that's how I understood simon's intention on the matter
[2014-04-18 09:50:59] lukeis: so providing your own Appium client library would be a very good thing

[2014-04-18 10:05:45] lukeis: and are you passing in a profile?
[2014-04-18 10:06:00] lagweezle: We've limited all our nodes to only allow one browser session (of any kind) to run at once. We are NOT passing in a profile.
[2014-04-18 10:06:27] lagweezle: At most we're specifying which browser and which OS as desired capabilities when instantiating RemoteWebDriver.

[2014-04-18 11:16:50] Prometheian: I have a webpage with a popup on it. The popup isn't a frame or window, and I don't see any trace of iframe in its declaration. Additionally, just waiting for it and then trying to interact isn't working. I'm at a loss. Suggestions?
[2014-04-18 11:18:03] jleyba: could be an absolutely positioned <div>
[2014-04-18 11:18:44] Prometheian: How would I interact w/ it then?
[2014-04-18 11:20:07] jleyba: same way you would any other element on the page
[2014-04-18 11:20:42] Prometheian: I've tried just using a wait and then interactive, but that hasn't worked.
[2014-04-18 11:21:01] jleyba: those types of dialogs are often implemented by appending the <div> to the end of document.body
[2014-04-18 11:21:31] jleyba: and using css to position it in the middle of the page
[2014-04-18 11:21:40] Prometheian: So do I need to refresh my driver somehow?
[2014-04-18 11:24:20] Prometheian: Sorry, never encoutnered this issue before.
[2014-04-18 11:24:47] Prometheian: iFrame, window swapping, jquery frame yeah
[2014-04-18 11:24:49] Prometheian: this no
[2014-04-18 11:25:12] jleyba: Is there a public version of your site?
[2014-04-18 11:25:35] Prometheian: Sadly no, but I can give you the html. :s

[2014-04-18 11:37:08] Prometheian: Two things. I think there's more the one element w/ that CSS. And why can't I call it using my driver?
[2014-04-18 11:38:59] dgempesaw, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-04-18 11:39:01] jleyba: 1) adjust the CSS to whatever you need.  Just play around in the JS console (document.querySelector(".ui-dialog"))
[2014-04-18 11:39:36] jleyba: 2) Not sure what you mean.  What error are you getting?
[2014-04-18 11:40:33] Prometheian: If I can't find an element w/in that dialog using driver.FindElement
[2014-04-18 11:40:48] jlipps: lukeis:  (responding to ^^) yes the bits we would contribute would be only the mobile spec bits, not the appium extension bits
[2014-04-18 11:40:51] Prometheian: Why would setting that dialog to a webelement and working off that work either?
[2014-04-18 11:43:13] Prometheian: Also there is only one .ui-dialog so that's good
